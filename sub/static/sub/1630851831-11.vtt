00:18.160 --> 00:22.440
OSHER: Welcome to the season finale
of The Bachelorette.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.720
Brooke's quest to find love
is one for the history books,

00:25.720 --> 00:29.520
and this
is the dramatic final chapter.

00:29.520 --> 00:35.200
Brooke is the first bisexual
Bachelorette anywhere in the world.

00:35.200 --> 00:38.360
And after meeting
20 eligible men and women,

00:38.360 --> 00:41.480
she is left with only two.

00:41.480 --> 00:44.760
Who will she choose?

00:44.760 --> 00:49.360
Will it be Darvid,
handsome, charming and steadfast?

00:49.360 --> 00:53.840
He left a lasting impression on her
from the moment they met.

00:53.840 --> 00:59.040
Or will it be Jamie-Lee,
dazzling, intriguing and adventurous?

00:59.040 --> 01:02.440
Years ago, she
walked into Brooke's life as a friend

01:02.440 --> 01:07.080
but has returned
hoping to win her heart.

01:07.080 --> 01:11.800
This is history,
and you are a part of it.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.080
Get set as Brooke embarks
on the final moments

01:15.080 --> 01:18.240
of her thrilling love story!

01:18.240 --> 01:22.080
Tonight...
(LAUGHS) This is so cool.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.960
..love is in the air...

01:23.960 --> 01:26.120
JAMIE-LEE:
I am totally in love with her.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.080
DARVID: I really do feel like
a perfect match for Brooke.

01:29.080 --> 01:32.160
..as Brooke makes her final decision.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.720
BROOKE:
This is all really coming to an end,

01:35.720 --> 01:39.720
but for me, it feels like
it's all just about to begin.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.120
But first...

01:41.120 --> 01:43.440
(SQUEALS)
Hello!

01:43.440 --> 01:45.760
..Jamie-Lee and Darvid
must impress...

01:45.760 --> 01:47.520
I think
I'm quite a protective friend.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.120
..Brooke's powerhouse friends...

01:49.120 --> 01:52.160
That's so unfair.
I don't like that. Grow up.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.440
..who leave no stone unturned.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.840
Do you know whose land are you on,
where you live?

01:56.840 --> 01:59.720
No.
Do you know who Brooke's mob is?

01:59.720 --> 02:00.720
No.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.240
So it would take
dating an Aboriginal woman

02:03.240 --> 02:06.040
for you to consider
that you live on Aboriginal land?

02:06.040 --> 02:08.600
I feel like
this couldn't have gone worse.

02:08.600 --> 02:13.120
Then the moment
we've all been waiting for...

02:13.120 --> 02:16.720
DARVID: If Brooke doesn't choose me,
I will be heartbroken.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.800
JAMIE-LEE:
It's all I've ever wanted, is her,

02:18.800 --> 02:22.280
and now I'm here, I'm so close.

02:22.280 --> 02:25.760
..when Brooke's destiny
is finally revealed.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.720
BROOKE:
I'm really and utterly in love.

02:27.720 --> 02:29.720
I'm so madly in love.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.800
BROOKE:
It actually just feels surreal.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.040
Like, I can't believe I'm at finale.

02:54.320 --> 02:58.200
I was so scared
that I was gonna come out of this

02:58.200 --> 03:01.120
the same as what I did before.

03:01.120 --> 03:06.560
And here I am, like, having to choose
between two beautiful people,

03:06.560 --> 03:09.240
knowing
that I'm gonna come out of this

03:09.240 --> 03:13.480
so madly in love and so loved.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.600
Hello.
Hi. I'm Jamie-Lee.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.720
BROOKE:
Jamie-Lee really stood out to me

03:23.720 --> 03:26.040
the first season I did The Bachelor.

03:26.040 --> 03:31.480
She was an intruder, and I thought
she was the hottest thing.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.720
(GASPS)

03:34.720 --> 03:35.800
Hey, babe.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.480
(LAUGHS)

03:37.480 --> 03:43.000
Seeing here on the red carpet
this time around blew my mind away.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.440
I know what I want now,
and I know where I want my future.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.840
BROOKE: When I'm with Jamie-Lee,
I feel, like,

03:48.840 --> 03:51.320
utterly, like, romanced by her.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.600
If I am one day lucky enough
to call you my partner,

03:54.600 --> 03:56.600
I'll feel incredible.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.080
Oh, Jamie.
(LAUGHS)

03:59.080 --> 04:02.960
She says the most beautiful
and thoughtful things.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.040
JAMIE-LEE: This is our story.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.800
(LAUGHS)

04:06.800 --> 04:08.600
I've left a lot of blank pages.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.560
Mmm.
Because I can see a future with you.

04:11.560 --> 04:14.240
BROOKE: Like my best friend and
my partner combined into one person,

04:14.240 --> 04:18.200
and I feel like
that's what I have always wanted.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.040
(LAUGHS)

04:25.760 --> 04:27.800
BROOKE: And then there's Darvid.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.120
I knew he was pretty special
from the first time I met him.

04:30.120 --> 04:33.360
So, I thought
I'd give you three wishes.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.600
OK.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.640
I know you already
used the first one on me appearing.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.800
Yeah. How did you know?

04:38.800 --> 04:42.160
I like the self-assuredness.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.920
Darvid.
Yep.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.960
Will you grant me the wish and...

04:46.960 --> 04:48.240
..accept this impression rose?

04:48.240 --> 04:50.000
Of course. I will.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.080
Of course.
Thank you.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.960
And throughout this experience,
like, he has just...

04:52.960 --> 04:55.200
..totally just gunned for me.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.200
What is that?

04:56.200 --> 04:58.640
Oh, he's gone and...
ring in a bunch of flowers.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.800
Oh, my God! (LAUGHS)

05:00.800 --> 05:02.200
BROOKE: He's not afraid to, you know,

05:02.200 --> 05:04.800
kind of ruffle a few feathers
or step on anyone's toes,

05:04.800 --> 05:08.760
which I find
is a bit sexy and confident.

05:08.760 --> 05:10.240
I'm so glad to have met you.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.760
Oh.
Yeah.

05:11.760 --> 05:16.040
When he feels things
and says things...

05:16.040 --> 05:17.760
Like, I'm all-in.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.320
..I trust his word.

05:25.080 --> 05:28.880
This is all really coming to an end.

05:30.560 --> 05:35.040
But for me, it feels like
it's all just about to begin.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.880
MAN: (IN VIDEO) Hi, Brooke.

05:44.880 --> 05:48.560
I'm talking from Gwambygine,
in Ballardong country, your country.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.080
Oh, my God.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.040
I'd like to have been over there,

05:52.040 --> 05:55.720
but not able to, so I thought
I'd send this message to you.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.160
BROOKE: Pete is like my dad.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.240
He's not my biological dad,

06:02.240 --> 06:05.880
but he's been
the father-figure in my life.

06:05.880 --> 06:09.280
I'd like to sit down and
meet some of the people you've met,

06:09.280 --> 06:11.520
play a bit of guitar
and talk their ears off.

06:11.520 --> 06:15.080
So I hope you've found
a really special person.

06:15.080 --> 06:18.400
And I hope you've had time to share
each other's hopes and dreams.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.800
Um, 'cause there's a lot of life
out there waiting for you

06:21.800 --> 06:26.520
and you deserve a...
you deserve a nice, solid home base

06:26.520 --> 06:29.720
to grow a family
and with lots of grannies.

06:29.720 --> 06:33.640
Um, so it's, um,
coming up to the big decision.

06:33.640 --> 06:38.160
I want you to know that your mum
and your grandmum are with you

06:38.160 --> 06:42.120
and they'd be very proud
of everything you've done

06:42.120 --> 06:44.320
and where you're going.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.360
Prayers with you
and all the prayers of your...

06:46.360 --> 06:50.520
..family and friends over here
with you, and God bless.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.240
Bye for now.
(SNIFFLES)

06:54.840 --> 06:57.240
(LAUGHS AND SNIFFLES)

07:00.400 --> 07:03.280
I hope they're proud of me.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.080
My mum and my nan passed away
when I was quite young.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.680
I've always felt
like my mum and my nan

07:09.680 --> 07:13.440
have really guided me through life.

07:13.440 --> 07:16.560
I always feel like they're around.

07:16.560 --> 07:17.840
(SIGHS)

07:17.840 --> 07:20.200
Oh, I miss Pete so much.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.280
(SNIFFLES)

07:22.280 --> 07:26.880
That makes me actually really happy
that I got to see him...

07:26.880 --> 07:28.160
..before this.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.640
BROOKE:
Unfortunately, my family are in WA,

07:30.640 --> 07:36.120
and they couldn't be here
to meet Jamie-Lee and Darvid,

07:36.120 --> 07:40.960
so I've called in two
incredibly strong powerhouse women

07:40.960 --> 07:42.760
to kind of take on that role.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.960
I've invited Abbie and Amy.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.320
Oh! (SIGHS)

07:48.320 --> 07:51.200
Watch out, Darvid and Jamie-Lee.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.480
I miss her so much.
I know.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.760
I'm nervous.
I hope we like the people.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.000
I think
they've got to be remarkable,

08:03.000 --> 08:04.040
for her to have picked them.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.440
So I'm, like, really excited...
Yeah.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.440
..to see who excites her enough
that she's choosing them.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.200
AMY: I think
I'm quite a protective friend.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.440
Brooke is such an intelligent
and kind and compassionate person.

08:15.440 --> 08:19.080
I know that she's hopeful
to find her person,

08:19.080 --> 08:20.880
and that's what we want for her.

08:20.880 --> 08:24.040
We could be about to meet
her long-term love.

08:24.040 --> 08:27.320
This person that's, like,
gonna become part of...our group.
I know. I know.

08:27.320 --> 08:31.600
ABBIE:
Brooke and I became friends because
we were both on The Bachelor.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.960
When you have
a very shared experience,

08:32.960 --> 08:35.480
you become close quite quickly.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.760
We want someone who's
willing to support Brooke's goals.
Mm-hm.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.680
It's OK for us to say that.
Oh, yeah, we're being selfish.

08:40.680 --> 08:44.520
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Very Brooke-centric today.
But that's our job.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.800
Like, you know, Brooke's our girl.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.360
I don't know you, random people.
Yeah, like...

08:47.360 --> 08:50.120
I'm really bad at reading people.
Like, really bad.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.120
I don't know why
she's asked me to come here.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.600
Like, I'm excited to see her,
but I'm, like,

08:53.600 --> 08:57.080
"Babe,
I am the worst judge of character."

08:58.640 --> 09:00.120
(SQUEALS)

09:00.120 --> 09:02.240
Hello!

09:02.240 --> 09:03.840
Oh, my God! You look so cute!
(LAUGHS)

09:03.840 --> 09:06.400
BROOKE:
I have missed my friends so much,

09:06.400 --> 09:09.120
so seeing Abbie and Amy, it's just...

09:09.120 --> 09:14.000
..oh, a nice real feeling
with them being right in front of me.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Stunning.
How are you?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.280
Good. How are YOU?
Oh!

09:16.280 --> 09:17.880
No-one's ever asked, "How are you?"
Yes!

09:17.880 --> 09:21.200
I'm good. I am, like, really good.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.200
(LAUGHS)

09:22.200 --> 09:24.040
BROOKE:
Abbie and I became friends after

09:24.040 --> 09:26.360
she was on Matt's season
of The Bachelor.

09:26.360 --> 09:31.040
And...Amy's like family.
She's mob, a proud Gamilaraay woman.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.480
I've really brought in the big guns.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.360
So, can you tell us who...tell us.
Yeah, tell us. What...

09:35.360 --> 09:37.120
OK.
Tell us the situation.
Tell us about your people.

09:37.120 --> 09:41.880
So, the first person is Darvid,
and he's from Brissie.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.400
He got the first impression rose.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.920
Oh!
'Cause he...
Oh!

09:44.920 --> 09:48.120
..fully, like, wooed me
the first night.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.120
Love a bit of wooing.
We love a woo, love an initial woo.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.280
Yeah, yeah.
He's a really beautiful guy.

09:54.280 --> 09:57.440
Then I've got Jamie-Lee,
who's equally as beautiful.

09:57.440 --> 09:58.720
Yes.

09:58.720 --> 10:01.800
So she was previously
on Nick's season, when I did it,

10:01.800 --> 10:03.520
but that wasn't our time or place,

10:03.520 --> 10:05.920
so we've had
a really strong friendship,

10:05.920 --> 10:07.520
and that's kind of now developed

10:07.520 --> 10:10.480
into, like,
a really beautiful relationship.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.480
She is the most thoughtful person,
like, is always thinking about me.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.360
Like, I...I've seen that
throughout this whole experience.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.640
So I see relationships
with both of them.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.240
So...should I go get...
I'm gonna go get them.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.880
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
Alright. Are you ready?

10:21.880 --> 10:23.720
Yes. Yes.
I'm so nervous.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.840
Darvid's up first,
meeting Abbie and Amy.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.960
I can't wait.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.320
Brooke looks real loved up. Like...

10:32.320 --> 10:33.800
I know. She's, like, smiling.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.080
She couldn't stop smiling talking
about both of them, which is good.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.920
I think she looks like she's...

10:37.920 --> 10:39.680
..she's definitely in love
with at least one of them.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.160
Yeah, I reckon...
I reckon she's in love.

10:41.160 --> 10:44.840
She's got that deep joy.
Yes! The deep joy!

10:44.840 --> 10:45.840
Can't relate.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.840
(BOTH LAUGH)

10:51.880 --> 10:53.640
Hello, handsome.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.360
Hey.
(LAUGHS) How are you?

10:55.360 --> 10:56.760
Mwah!

10:56.760 --> 10:58.400
You OK?
Yeah, good.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.400
How are ya?
Oh!

10:59.400 --> 11:00.400
Missed you.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.680
Missed you too.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.400
How you feeling?
I'm good.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.680
How are YOU feeling?
Hey, good.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.960
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.040
You OK?
Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.240
Yeah?
Yeah. I think so.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.000
Yeah. You're in the hot seat today.
I know.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.560
You're meeting two of my friends.
Cool.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.920
Abbie and Amy.
Mm-hm.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.400
This is the most nervous
I've been, I reckon.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.880
Really?
Yeah, I reckon.
Oh!

11:21.880 --> 11:23.960
'Cause I've made
a good impression on you.
Tables have turned.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.760
I know. I know.
(LAUGHS)

11:25.760 --> 11:28.560
BROOKE: Darvid is always
really calm, cool, collected,

11:28.560 --> 11:32.400
but today,
he looks extremely nervous.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.640
(LAUGHS)
I've never seen him like this.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.440
ABBIE: Oh, my God, I'm so nervous.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.440
Hi.
Hello!
DARVID: Hey.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.520
Oh, OK.
DARVID: How you doing?
BROOKE: This is Abbie.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.000
Hello. I'm Abbie.
Nice to meet you.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.640
Let's hug. Yep.
Mwah!

11:45.640 --> 11:47.080
DARVID: I'm actually quite nervous.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.600
It's critical
that I make a good impression.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.160
I just want to make sure
I articulate my answers

11:51.160 --> 11:54.160
honestly and openly, so...yep.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.160
So...
Yes.

11:55.160 --> 11:58.320
..a little birdie, Brooke, told us
that you live up in Brisbane.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.160
I'm in Brissie. Yep.
OK.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.560
And Brooke lives in Melbourne.
Yes.

12:02.560 --> 12:03.920
The hot topic.
(ABBIE LAUGHS)

12:03.920 --> 12:06.320
Yeah - I've been in Brissie
for, like, my whole life

12:06.320 --> 12:08.240
since I moved from England.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.800
I'm pretty open to moving.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.040
Um...
OK.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.920
..but a few things
that I have to sort out first.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.120
OK.
So...
Like?

12:14.120 --> 12:16.560
DARVID: I got a house,
dog and a business in Brissie,

12:16.560 --> 12:18.240
not that my dog's an issue, but...

12:18.240 --> 12:21.840
..business would have to
sort of tie things off.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.160
But you've got that full intention
to figure it out?
I actually do.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.160
OK.
Yep.

12:25.160 --> 12:28.360
I mean,
I think that's all that matters.
Yeah. As long as there's...

12:28.360 --> 12:29.480
It's a lot to ask.
No, I...

12:29.480 --> 12:30.880
Like...
..like, yeah.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.720
It just feels right.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.200
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

12:37.200 --> 12:39.520
Sorry. So...smitten.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.880
Do you guys want us to go?
(LAUGHS)

12:41.880 --> 12:44.760
AMY: I have never seen Brooke
like that.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.640
There is obviously chemistry there.
They are into each other.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.560
That was borderline awkward.
(LAUGHS)

12:50.560 --> 12:52.920
Um...
(ALL LAUGH)

12:52.920 --> 12:54.360
That was so funny.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.520
"BB?"

12:56.520 --> 12:59.240
Yeah, I'm thinking, like...
'sup, Abs?

12:59.240 --> 13:02.840
Oh, my God!
Don't!

13:02.840 --> 13:05.480
ABBIE: Oh, my God -
Darvid and Brooke are, like...

13:05.480 --> 13:07.040
..uh, confronting.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.920
Never seen her like this.
She's obsessed with him.

13:09.920 --> 13:13.800
But it's cute, I guess.
It's just, like, a lot to handle.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.520
Oh!
This is cute.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.760
Yeah.
We like this.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.040
AMY:
Well, can I take you for a chat?

13:19.040 --> 13:21.760
'Cause I would like to know...
DARVID: You can. Yes.
..some more things about you.

13:21.760 --> 13:22.800
Yes.
OK.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.200
Beautiful.
AMY: So I'm just gonna
pull Darvid aside.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.440
I want to ask him
some of the questions that...

13:27.440 --> 13:30.920
..I suppose Brooke
may not have had the opportunity to

13:30.920 --> 13:33.600
directly and overtly ask him

13:33.600 --> 13:35.240
that I think will matter to Brooke.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.520
DARVID: Oof!

13:36.520 --> 13:40.440
Amy, I would describe as, like,
a force to be reckoned with.

13:40.440 --> 13:44.200
Being an academic,
she's a very strong-minded,

13:44.200 --> 13:46.480
intellectual, intelligent woman.

13:46.480 --> 13:50.040
And I would not want to be
on her bad side.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.040
OSHER: Up next...

13:52.040 --> 13:55.040
Do you know if I said to you,
whose land are you on,
where you live, can you tell me?

13:55.040 --> 13:56.520
No.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.040
So you don't know that?
No. No.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.120
So it would take
dating an Aboriginal woman

14:01.120 --> 14:06.000
for you to start to consider
that you live on Aboriginal land?

14:07.400 --> 14:08.880
AMY: He's gonna be
on a steep learning curve

14:08.880 --> 14:11.960
if he ends up partnered
with a pansexual black woman.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.600
Do you know who Brooke's mob is?

14:13.600 --> 14:14.760
No.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.880
I don't know how to answer this.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.960
I'm not quite sure
how to answer that question.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.080
I guess...

14:20.080 --> 14:23.090
I feel like
this couldn't have gone worse.

14:23.090 --> 14:25.160
I don't know
how to recover from this.

14:38.680 --> 14:39.760
Hey.
Hey. Yaama.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.800
Thank you for coming
and have a little chat with me.

14:41.800 --> 14:45.080
You're welcome.
So, obviously, I love Brooke.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.720
Brooke's a very special person
to me, and...

14:47.720 --> 14:50.440
..I think that you are a really
special person to Brooke already.

14:50.440 --> 14:51.440
Yep.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.920
What I'm looking for
in someone for Brooke

14:52.920 --> 14:56.520
is someone who, hopefully, has
some good, like, racial literacy,

14:56.520 --> 14:59.240
who's across
matters that are important to Brooke

14:59.240 --> 15:01.600
and appreciates all of Brooke,

15:01.600 --> 15:03.560
including her sovereignty

15:03.560 --> 15:06.960
and her strong cultural connections
and community.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.640
So, Brooke's
a proud Aboriginal woman.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.720
Yep.

15:10.720 --> 15:13.720
Where are you at with your, like,
cultural literacy in general?

15:13.720 --> 15:15.000
Yeah. Yeah.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.920
So, like, do you know if I said
to you, whose land are you on,

15:16.920 --> 15:18.120
where you live, can you tell me?

15:18.120 --> 15:19.600
No.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.800
So you don't know that?
No. No.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.000
So it would take
dating an Aboriginal woman

15:25.000 --> 15:30.360
for you to start to consider
that you live on Aboriginal land?

15:33.640 --> 15:36.240
It's just something
I haven't given too much thought to.

15:36.240 --> 15:38.480
I don't know what that is,
maybe immaturity.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.760
Never really taken the time to...

15:40.760 --> 15:43.760
..appreciate and understand
as much as I should have.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.240
AMY: He's gonna be
on a steep learning curve

15:45.240 --> 15:47.920
if he ends up partnered
with a pansexual black woman,

15:47.920 --> 15:51.960
and if he doesn't have experience
with these communities,

15:51.960 --> 15:55.280
he needs to really be willing
to get across the issues,

15:55.280 --> 15:56.680
because Brooke's
passionate about them,

15:56.680 --> 15:59.440
but also 'cause he won't be able to
avoid them if they're partnered up.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.840
But I'm willing to learn, and
I'm willing to be a part of it all.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.960
I think that's important regardless.
I'd actually really step into it.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.200
Like, I'd love to learn about it.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.280
OK.
Yeah.

16:08.280 --> 16:12.960
I do feel pretty naive and ashamed
that I haven't done the research.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.240
I'd always step into
whatever it is that she needs.

16:15.240 --> 16:19.280
Like, I wouldn't lay that on her,
just for her to explain or...no way.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.720
OK. That's great.

16:20.720 --> 16:21.880
AMY: I like his intention.

16:21.880 --> 16:26.920
He articulated a really strong
intention to get across it.

16:26.920 --> 16:30.080
I like that.
I think that's a really green flag.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.680
So then the other thing,
'cause obviously, you know,

16:32.680 --> 16:33.680
this season is iconic.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.120
Because Brooke's...
Yes.

16:35.120 --> 16:39.240
..not only a black woman, um,
but she is pansexual.
Yep.

16:39.240 --> 16:43.040
So, um, if you don't mind me asking,
like, do you identify as straight?

16:43.040 --> 16:44.040
Straight.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.600
Have you thought that through,
like, as a...

16:45.600 --> 16:47.200
I have.
OK.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.600
I just don't think it...I just...
I don't think it matters - like...

16:50.600 --> 16:53.200
..that's not worrying me at all,
is my honest answer.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.800
Um...

16:54.800 --> 16:57.440
..I...I love
that she's open about everything.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.440
And doesn't scare me.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.520
OK.
Yeah.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.240
I will stand by Brooke
in whoever she is.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.560
That...that's part of a relationship.

17:05.560 --> 17:09.080
Well, thank you for answering my
hard-hitting questions with grace.

17:09.080 --> 17:11.040
DARVID: And if I'm lucky enough to be

17:11.040 --> 17:13.560
Brooke's partner
at the end of all of this,

17:13.560 --> 17:17.080
I will be there to support her,
so I hope Amy can feel that.

17:20.800 --> 17:21.800
Darvid.
Abs.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.200
(LAUGHS)

17:24.200 --> 17:26.760
How you going?
Yeah, I'm alright. Yeah.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.160
I was nervous
before speaking to Amy, but...

17:29.160 --> 17:32.440
..after the conversation,
I'm even more nervous.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.280
It's Abbie's turn,
and I'm really hoping

17:34.280 --> 17:36.720
it's a bit easier
than Amy's grilling.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.520
So how do you feel about Brooke?

17:40.520 --> 17:44.400
I'm...I've been
head over heels for her for a while.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.680
I've been falling...

17:46.680 --> 17:49.400
..definitely
falling in love with her.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.280
You ARE falling in love with her?

17:51.280 --> 17:52.760
Yeah...

17:52.760 --> 17:54.320
Yeah.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.640
I kind of pictured her in my life.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.840
And I pictured her as a mum.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.800
Mmm.
Pictured her as a partner.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.560
No, I've definitely...

18:01.560 --> 18:03.920
..I've definitely
fallen in love with Brooke.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.480
So you DO love her?

18:06.720 --> 18:08.720
Yep. I do love her.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.200
So...

18:10.200 --> 18:11.520
I haven't told her yet.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.560
Why don't you tell her at
your final date and tell her then?

18:13.560 --> 18:16.240
Yeah. I think she knows.
How will she know?

18:16.240 --> 18:18.840
I think I'll tell her
if she picks me.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.400
Why? That's so unfair.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.760
Is it?
I don't like that.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.360
I'm waiting for the right moment.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.480
That right moment is not finale!
You cannot hold it.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.200
You cannot hold it
like a little carrot

18:27.200 --> 18:29.480
and be, like, "Well, if she picks
me, then I'll tell her I love her."

18:29.480 --> 18:31.800
The whole point of being vulnerable
and open is that you tell them.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.800
I am vuln...I'm SO vulnerable.
I told Matt top three!

18:33.800 --> 18:35.880
Grow up!
(LAUGHS)

18:35.880 --> 18:36.880
And I still lost.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.000
(LAUGHS)
But you know what?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.520
On the plane home,
I was crying and I thought,

18:39.520 --> 18:40.840
"At least told him I loved him."

18:40.840 --> 18:42.560
Yeah.
I DID love him.

18:42.560 --> 18:43.680
Yeah.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.600
DARVID: I know that
I've fallen in love with Brooke,

18:45.600 --> 18:46.800
and that's not what scares me.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.880
Um, what scares me is telling her
and her not choosing me at the end.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.640
It's a very vulnerable position
to be in,

18:53.640 --> 18:56.200
and that's the only reason
I haven't told her yet.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.440
I just think it's really important
that she has the full story,

18:58.440 --> 19:00.680
and she needs to have
all the information

19:00.680 --> 19:02.520
to be able to make
the right decision for her.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.520
Yeah, I know.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.040
'Cause she's got
two really strong connections.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.200
Yeah.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.440
And I know it's scary.
Yeah, I know.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.600
DARVID: I definitely didn't have
a perfect innings with Amy and Abbie,

19:12.600 --> 19:15.800
but I was genuine, I was open and
honest, and I hope they can see that.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.120
BROOKE: Oh. Here we go. (LAUGHS)

19:22.120 --> 19:23.960
How'd you go?

19:23.960 --> 19:25.560
Oh, you got
some protective friends, Brooke.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.200
(ALL LAUGH)
Says you!

19:28.200 --> 19:29.440
I know. I know.

19:29.440 --> 19:32.400
You've got two powerhouse women
in YOUR life. These are mine.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.800
I know how you feel.
ABBIE: I like him.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.560
I think he really likes Brooke
a lot. You can tell that for sure.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.040
Nice to meet... Mwah! Ooh!

19:40.040 --> 19:42.840
ABBIE: I think it's a nice vibe.
I think they're really sweet.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.920
They kind of, like,
already seem like they're together.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.600
They seem like
it's Brooke's boyfriend

19:46.600 --> 19:48.240
she's bringing in to meet us,

19:48.240 --> 19:50.320
which is really nice.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.320
That was a lot.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.040
That was...if she's like that
with both of them, honestly...
I'll be, like...

19:54.040 --> 19:56.640
..I'm scared for their...
both their little hearts.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.120
Oh, my gosh!

19:58.120 --> 20:00.240
I love that she can see a future
with both people,

20:00.240 --> 20:03.600
because that means that she's got
two really great people at the end,

20:03.600 --> 20:05.760
which is also kind of sad,
'cause it means one of them's

20:05.760 --> 20:08.400
probably going
to get their heart broken.

20:24.960 --> 20:29.960
JAMIE-LEE: I haven't seen Brooke
since my last date, and...

20:29.960 --> 20:32.600
..you know, I'm in the final two,
and that says something.

20:34.560 --> 20:37.440
There's no question in my mind.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.520
I know now
that she has feelings for me.

20:41.320 --> 20:47.120
It's really nice to be here. You
know, this is the girl of my dreams.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.960
Hello, good-looking.
Hey!

20:48.960 --> 20:51.400
How are ya?
Good. How are YOU?

20:51.400 --> 20:52.760
Good.
You right?

20:52.760 --> 20:54.680
You look beautiful.
Mwah!

20:54.680 --> 20:57.280
My God!
I feel like it's been so long.

20:57.280 --> 20:58.960
I know.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.480
Mmm. Haven't seen you since our date.
Yeah. I know!

21:01.480 --> 21:03.200
A lot's happened, huh?
Yeah.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.760
Are you excited for today?
I'm so excited.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.040
You look beautiful.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.520
Thank you, babe. You look stunning.
Thank you.
As always.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.160
Oh, I did miss you. Mwah.
Back at ya.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.040
Um...
Tell me, what's happening today?

21:12.040 --> 21:14.600
OK. So you're meeting
two of my mates.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.600
OK. Your friends.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.360
Um, and then...
sorry, I was looking at the rings.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.880
And then...
You look beautiful.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.200
Yeah, you look stunning.
You're really gorgeous today.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.520
Sorry. I really missed you.
I'm so happy to see you.
I'm being weird.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.680
No, I love weird!
Weird is my favourite.

21:27.680 --> 21:31.600
So happy to see you.
OK.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.880
Now I'm better.
Yeah, same.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.960
I'm calm.
Yeah, me too.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.960
I'm being so nervous. (LAUGHS)
Aw!

21:39.960 --> 21:43.000
I'm really happy to be here.
You'll be fine. You'll be great.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.120
Just be you.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.680
Ready to meet the girls?
Yeah. Yeah.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.480
So Abbie and Amy.
Yeah, for sure.
Yep.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.960
Alright. Let's go.
Yep. Abbie and Amy.
Yeah.

21:48.960 --> 21:52.200
JAMIE-LEE: Meeting Brooke's friends,
there's so much pressure on today.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.280
I want to make a good impression
more than anything.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.280
Today needs to go well.

21:59.200 --> 22:03.080
(LAUGHTER)
WOMEN: Hello.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.480
This is Amy.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.120
Hi. Jamie-Lee?
Amy. I'm Jamie-Lee.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.280
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.280
You look beautiful.
You too.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.680
And this is Abbie.
Hi. I'm Abbie. Nice to meet you.

22:10.680 --> 22:14.560
Nice to meet you.
Good to see YOU.
Shall we?

22:14.560 --> 22:16.160
Hey, guys.
How you going, babe?

22:16.160 --> 22:17.280
Hi. Yaama.
I'm good. How are YOU?

22:17.280 --> 22:19.880
Good. Very excited to meet you.
Thanks!

22:19.880 --> 22:22.120
Excited to be here. I really am.
Yeah?

22:22.120 --> 22:25.120
Yeah! What's, uh, going on?

22:25.120 --> 22:27.440
Loving getting to catch up
with Brooke and hearing...

22:27.440 --> 22:29.080
Yeah.
..about your dates.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.360
We heard about
your record-breaking kiss.

22:31.360 --> 22:33.880
Just a casual five minutes.
It's, like, no biggie.
Yeah.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.200
So how do you guys know Brooke?

22:36.200 --> 22:37.560
Well, I'm mob, so I'm...
Yep.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.800
..Gomeroi, and...
we've known each other for a while.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.720
And then...
Yeah, we have. Yeah.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.360
And then Abbie, I...
Oh, Bachelor. I mean...

22:43.360 --> 22:46.960
(ALL LAUGH)
I actually asked Abbie on a date.
On a date.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.520
(ALL LAUGH)
Alright.

22:48.520 --> 22:52.160
She rejected me twice.
No. No. OK. She...no.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.840
She has this narrative of lies
that she tells everyone.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.000
She's, like, "You kept ignoring me."
No, I didn't.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.400
It was during peak COVID.
She was in Perth. I was in Brisbane.

23:00.400 --> 23:03.880
I can't come.
Look at you go. Right.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.520
Don't make my girlfriend jealous. OK?
Oh, sorry.
Nup. We're good.

23:06.520 --> 23:10.320
Stop it.
I'm not a jealous kind of girl.
You brought it up! I wasn't gonna...

23:10.320 --> 23:12.200
I'm just saying, that
this is the relationship we have.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.560
Honesty, yeah.
We...we've moved past that, babe.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.640
She's protecting you.
Stop bringing it up.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.000
Abbie, it's done.
Honestly, let it go, Abbie.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.200
Do you mind?

23:20.200 --> 23:23.400
This initial meeting is, like,
how I kind of pictured it to be -

23:23.400 --> 23:25.480
like, lots of laughing, giggling.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.200
Like, all my friends and my partner
is together.

23:28.200 --> 23:31.360
OK, not jealous, tick. We like this.
Tick.

23:31.360 --> 23:34.520
You guys are a lot of fun.
(WOMEN LAUGH)

23:34.520 --> 23:36.760
Alright. Well, Jamie-Lee, do you
want to go for a little chat alone?

23:36.760 --> 23:39.480
Let's talk about
how not jealous we are.

23:39.480 --> 23:40.880
Alright.
(WOMEN LAUGH)

23:40.880 --> 23:45.200
I knew that I'd be pulled away
for a chat, so, like, bring it on.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.320
I've got this.
You know, I just need to be myself.

23:47.320 --> 23:48.920
I just need to...

23:48.920 --> 23:52.080
..hold...hang in there and
just answer things and be truthful.

23:52.080 --> 23:55.080
Abbie's been in my shoes.
She knows what this is like.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.400
Jamie-Lee, babes.
(LAUGHS)

24:02.400 --> 24:05.320
So I did want to ask you, why did you
wait to apply for the show

24:05.320 --> 24:06.480
to, like, shoot your shot?

24:06.480 --> 24:07.560
Yeah.

24:07.560 --> 24:10.080
So, when I came out of the mansion
the first time,

24:10.080 --> 24:12.320
I thought
Brooke would end up with Nick.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.560
I just...when I left,
that's the way things were going.

24:15.560 --> 24:17.360
I did what I thought was right,
you know,

24:17.360 --> 24:20.160
and I just kept those feelings
close to my heart because...

24:20.160 --> 24:21.960
..I didn't want
to ruin that for Brooke either.

24:21.960 --> 24:25.640
Mm-hm.
She was...in my eyes,
was going to end up with Nick.

24:25.640 --> 24:26.640
Yeah.
So, yeah.

24:26.640 --> 24:27.680
It wasn't the right timing.

24:27.680 --> 24:31.000
And then, you know, it never has
been, until Brooke's Bachelorette.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.360
You...
OK.

24:32.360 --> 24:33.960
..you got your one chance -
it's...this is it.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.280
Now I know what I want. (LAUGHS)
Yeah.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.520
You know - like, there's...
there's no question in my mind.

24:37.520 --> 24:38.920
Yeah.
Abs...like, nothing.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.120
And you want Brooke, obviously.
Obviously.

24:41.120 --> 24:43.440
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. 100%. 100%.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.480
Um, and, obviously, there's
a chance that it won't be you.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.960
Mm-hm.
How would you feel?

24:47.960 --> 24:50.240
And how that...
what that mean for your friendship?

24:50.240 --> 24:51.920
Would you have to back away
from the friendship?

24:51.920 --> 24:53.280
I think so, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah?

24:53.280 --> 24:55.800
I think so, yeah,
and I...I kind of...

24:55.800 --> 24:57.600
(SIGHS) ..yeah.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.600
But it's worth it.
Yeah. Yeah.
You know.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.600
It's worth having my heart broken,
because there's a chance

25:01.600 --> 25:03.360
that it could be
something really beautiful.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.360
Mm-hm.
So, like, yeah.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.520
It's gonna suck, but...I'm hopeful.

25:06.520 --> 25:07.720
Yeah.
Yep.

25:07.720 --> 25:12.560
I know that there's something really
beautiful between Brooke and I.

25:12.560 --> 25:15.400
I'm not here to be friends
with Brooke. I'm not, you know.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.160
And I...I don't know how to go
from being in love with someone

25:18.160 --> 25:20.160
to being their friend.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.680
Oh. Nice.
(LAUGHS)

25:21.680 --> 25:23.400
Just...maybe put in
a good word for me.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.040
OK. I will. I will.
(LAUGHS)

25:25.040 --> 25:26.720
ABBIE: Jamie-Lee
has so many great qualities.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.240
She's really warm. She's sweet.
She's easy to talk to.

25:29.240 --> 25:31.560
You know, I'd love to have her
at a dinner party with my friends.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.160
I think she's wonderful.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.280
Um, and I think her and Brooke

25:34.280 --> 25:35.960
have a really strong connection
and a friendship,

25:35.960 --> 25:39.080
which is the basis
to any good relationship.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.440
JAMIE-LEE: This is lovely.
AMY: Isn't it?

25:43.440 --> 25:45.320
Well, thanks for coming
and having a little chat with me.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.000
That's alright.
It's lovely to meet you.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.640
Like, you're obviously a spectacular
person to get to this point.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.520
Yeah.
And...
I feel very lucky.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.560
So, like, obviously, as a loved one
of Brooke, I have questions.

25:56.560 --> 25:57.560
Yeah, of course.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.240
Um...so I understand
that you and Brooke

25:59.240 --> 26:02.560
have, like, a couple of years
of, like, gentle history.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.560
Like...
Yeah.

26:03.560 --> 26:05.560
..you've known each other
before coming onto the show.

26:05.560 --> 26:06.560
Mm-hm.

26:06.560 --> 26:11.320
Um, how across Indigenous issues
and truths and histories

26:11.320 --> 26:13.800
would you say you are?

26:13.800 --> 26:15.960
Um, look, not...

26:15.960 --> 26:17.000
..I am...

26:17.000 --> 26:18.600
..I understand, and I'm...I'm...

26:18.600 --> 26:21.360
..I guess
I'm as privy to it as I can be.

26:21.360 --> 26:23.080
I, um...
OK.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.760
So, um,
you live in the Sydney region.
Yeah.

26:25.760 --> 26:28.520
So if I said to you, whose land
are you on, you'd be able to tell me?

26:28.520 --> 26:29.920
No.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.520
Do you know who's Brooke...
who Brooke's mob is?

26:32.520 --> 26:33.520
No.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.280
OK.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.720
I didn't come in with these questions

26:38.720 --> 26:41.240
ready to judge a person
for not knowing.

26:41.240 --> 26:43.840
That's absolutely not the issue here.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.240
The issue here, firstly,

26:45.240 --> 26:48.600
how can you even just be
friends with someone for three years

26:48.600 --> 26:54.160
and not know something that's
such a core part of their identity?

26:54.160 --> 26:57.520
And it's...it's a big part
of everything for Brooke.

26:57.520 --> 27:00.440
So for me,
I just question the depth there.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.680
Guess I just, like...
I...I don't know e-enough,

27:05.680 --> 27:08.640
but I...as...like, as m...

27:08.640 --> 27:10.360
Yeah. I don't know enough, I guess.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.560
Yeah, OK.
Yeah.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.880
It's concerning to me for you to say

27:13.880 --> 27:16.000
that you feel like
you're across some.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.120
But I would consider,
like, a basic...

27:18.120 --> 27:21.040
Yeah.
..piece of information
is knowing whose land you're on.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.360
This is a core part of who Brooke is.

27:22.360 --> 27:25.160
This isn't just something she's
passionate about. It's her identity.

27:25.160 --> 27:27.960
Telling me that
you're across things when you're not,

27:27.960 --> 27:33.000
not having anything to offer,
after asserting that you know a lot,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.800
just runs red flags for me.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.280
You're right.
I don't know whose land I'm on.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.680
And I...that's...I should.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.240
Yeah.
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.600
You're...you're 100% right.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.680
JAMIE-LEE:
You know, I'm realising that, oh,

27:43.680 --> 27:47.000
I've actually messed up here,
and now I'm realising this

27:47.000 --> 27:49.760
in front of someone
that I'm trying to impress.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.240
I want to say the right thing.

27:51.240 --> 27:54.400
I want to show you who I am
and that I have good intention

27:54.400 --> 27:57.400
and that I try to be
the best person I can be.

27:57.400 --> 28:01.480
And I'm just realising that, like,
no, "Just stop...stop talking,"

28:01.480 --> 28:02.760
'cause this is...

28:02.760 --> 28:04.240
..I...I...

28:04.240 --> 28:06.400
..I don't know how to answer this.

28:08.800 --> 28:13.560
I don't have the right knowledge,
and I'm going to change that.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.320
I really am.
Yep.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.760
Um, I have a lot to learn...

28:16.760 --> 28:19.760
OK.
..definitely, and I want to learn.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.520
I feel like
this couldn't have gone worse.

28:21.520 --> 28:24.880
You know, this is such
an important conversation to have.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.720
Brooke's going to hear about this,
you know,

28:26.720 --> 28:29.640
and that could put doubt
in Brooke's mind.

28:29.640 --> 28:30.680
Like, I...

28:30.680 --> 28:33.280
..I don't know
how to recover from this.

28:43.880 --> 28:47.480
How did your chat go?
It was horrible. No. No.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.600
You're good?
Yeah.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.120
Was very generous in her answers,
and it was a good chat.

28:52.120 --> 28:54.240
I feel deflated, to be honest.

28:54.240 --> 28:57.320
You know, I wish that things
had have gone differently.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.120
I wish that I had have known more.

28:59.120 --> 29:03.200
I wish that I had have
articulated myself better.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.800
It's been really great.
Thank you. Yeah.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.320
What a privilege for us,
to be able to, you know, meet...

29:07.320 --> 29:09.000
Yeah.
..someone who's important to you.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.640
And that's important to us.
Same goes.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.760
Yeah.
Absolutely. I feel very lucky.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.200
Oh.
(LAUGHS)

29:14.200 --> 29:17.400
On that kind of bittersweet note,
I will walk her out.

29:17.400 --> 29:18.720
It's been lovely.
Say your goodbyes.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.480
Good to meet you.
Really lovely to meet you.

29:20.480 --> 29:22.440
Mwah!
(WOMEN LAUGH)

29:22.440 --> 29:24.120
Good luck.
Bye.

29:24.120 --> 29:27.560
Thanks so much, guys.
It's been lovely.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.680
Bye!
Nice to meet you both.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.400
I'm sure that they saw that I was
genuine. You know, I really am.

29:33.400 --> 29:36.880
I just hope that I've done enough.
I really do.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.720
How'd your chat go?

29:38.720 --> 29:40.800
How did YOUR chat go?
Well!

29:40.800 --> 29:41.800
OK.
Yeah.

29:41.800 --> 29:42.920
Alright.
(LAUGHS)

29:42.920 --> 29:45.400
See, I feel like there's an energy.

29:45.400 --> 29:49.000
Now that Abbie and Amy have
got to meet Darvid and Jamie-Lee,

29:49.000 --> 29:52.680
I am really keen to hear
what they have to say.

29:52.680 --> 29:53.680
Hi!
Hello.

29:53.680 --> 29:54.720
Hello.
I'm back.
Hi, gorgeous!

29:54.720 --> 29:57.480
BROOKE: They'll provide
a bit of a perspective,

29:57.480 --> 30:00.400
which is what I need
to make this decision.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.200
What did you think?

30:02.200 --> 30:04.560
AMY AND ABBIE: Yeah.
(ALL LAUGH)

30:04.560 --> 30:08.840
That was in sync. It's good.
Yeah.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.960
You've brought two people
who seem really lovely,

30:11.960 --> 30:15.200
who obviously you have
very different dynamics with,

30:15.200 --> 30:17.720
but I've got some concerns.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.280
Ooh! OK.
I do.

30:19.280 --> 30:22.920
BROOKE: The fact that we're
jumping straight into concerns...

30:22.920 --> 30:25.640
..I'm, like, "Oh, no.

30:25.640 --> 30:27.400
"Here we go."

30:27.400 --> 30:29.760
The con for me with Jamie-Lee
is the depth.

30:29.760 --> 30:32.840
I asked her, "Where are you at with
your, like, cultural knowledge?"

30:32.840 --> 30:35.200
Like, "Where would you say you're at
across the board?"

30:35.200 --> 30:38.440
And she said, essentially,
that she's across it as she can be

30:38.440 --> 30:40.600
without
being Indigenous herself, right?

30:40.600 --> 30:43.120
And I thought, "I love that."
Like, "What a great answer."

30:43.120 --> 30:45.360
I said, "So, could you tell me
whose country you're on?"

30:45.360 --> 30:47.200
And she was, like, "No."

30:47.200 --> 30:49.920
And then I was, like, "OK.
Do you know what mob Brooke is?"

30:49.920 --> 30:51.160
"No."

30:51.160 --> 30:53.000
Oh.
Um, and I thought, "OK," like...

30:53.000 --> 30:54.320
I thought
she would know those things.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.320
You know, there are
a lot of really great people

30:56.320 --> 30:58.000
who don't have that knowledge.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.920
And if they've
got the right attitude

30:59.920 --> 31:01.480
and they're willing to learn,

31:01.480 --> 31:03.200
then they can still be
a great partner.

31:03.200 --> 31:06.920
My concern with her is
she's known you for three years.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.400
She talks about
being in love with you.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.360
She doesn't know what mob you are.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.200
So, like...
Does she really know me?

31:13.200 --> 31:15.000
Like, does she actually know you?
Yeah.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.160
Or does she like the idea of me?
Right.

31:17.160 --> 31:18.800
Did you ask Darvid those questions?
Yes, I did.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.880
And what did he say?
Right.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.320
So, um, I asked Darvid
and he didn't know either.

31:24.320 --> 31:25.800
Mmm.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.840
But he has
only just gotten to know you.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.040
Yep.

31:30.040 --> 31:32.760
But she's had three years
of liking you, she says,

31:32.760 --> 31:34.440
of having you on her radar,
of being your friend.

31:34.440 --> 31:37.320
Following me and watching my stuff.
And it's in your bio.

31:37.320 --> 31:40.600
Like, you mention it.
It's such a big part of who you are.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.720
For me, as your friend,

31:42.720 --> 31:45.200
I would want someone
to know those things about you

31:45.200 --> 31:46.640
after three years of...

31:46.640 --> 31:48.400
Absolutely, yeah. For sure.
..acquaintance, even.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.400
Um...
Yep.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.760
..but on the plus side,
she's clearly smitten with you.

31:51.760 --> 31:54.720
Mmm.
And...I mean, why wouldn't she be?

31:54.720 --> 31:55.720
Um...but she's lovely.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.000
I'm just worried about the depth
at the end of the day.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Mmm!

31:59.000 --> 32:02.800
I'm so sorry.
I've got so much to think about.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.960
Brooke has a really tough decision.

32:04.960 --> 32:08.840
On the other hand, we've got Darvid.
You guys are obsessed.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.560
It's gross.
It was...we were uncomfortable.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.520
Um, Darvid's really passionate,
really into you.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.120
Obviously,
you have a really great connection.

32:14.120 --> 32:17.800
And it's very obvious to me that
it's a very romantic connection.

32:20.120 --> 32:23.040
I am worried that he won't be able
to make it logistically work.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.040
ABBIE: There's a chance
that Darvid won't be able

32:25.040 --> 32:26.840
to move down to Melbourne.

32:26.840 --> 32:30.400
He does have a lot of different
things that are keeping him there.

32:30.400 --> 32:33.760
So neither of them are a no from me.
Yes.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.240
Which is good.
Yeah.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.880
Good sign. Thank you.

32:36.880 --> 32:40.200
I really don't think
this is a right or wrong.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.400
It's whatever she feels,
which is hard.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.320
Whoever you pick
will be more than welcome

32:45.320 --> 32:47.960
at our barbecues and our drinks.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.600
They would both...
they would both fit in.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.960
Mmm.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.160
Like...

32:52.160 --> 32:54.040
..you'll make it work
with whoever you pick.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.720
Yeah.
Yeah.

32:55.720 --> 32:56.760
They're both really lovely

32:56.760 --> 32:58.480
and really care about you
very obviously.

32:58.480 --> 33:00.120
Yeah.
Yeah.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.120
OK.

33:02.120 --> 33:05.640
BROOKE: I have loved
having Amy and Abbie here,

33:05.640 --> 33:09.840
but it's also made my decision
much harder in some way because...

33:09.840 --> 33:11.960
..they've really pulled me
out of my love bubble now

33:11.960 --> 33:14.960
and being, like, "Hey. This is real."

33:14.960 --> 33:15.960
Mwah!

33:18.560 --> 33:20.560
BROOKE:
I know it's really not gonna be

33:20.560 --> 33:25.720
just an easy, like, yes/no decision.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.640
Mmm, y...

33:28.640 --> 33:30.120
Yeah.

33:30.120 --> 33:34.440
It's just such an intense decision
to make about your life

33:34.440 --> 33:38.200
and the lives
that you're possibly about to have.

33:38.200 --> 33:41.120
So who do you think
Brooke should choose?

33:41.120 --> 33:42.440
OK.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.120
What about
if on the count of three...

33:44.120 --> 33:45.120
Mmm.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.120
..we both say who she...
we think she should pick?

33:47.120 --> 33:48.680
OK.
You do the count.

33:48.680 --> 33:51.440
Is it "One, two, three, go"?
(LAUGHS)

33:51.440 --> 33:53.160
"One, two, three," say the name.
OK.

33:53.160 --> 33:55.640
Right.
One, two, three.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.840
OSHER: Coming up...
(BOTH LAUGH)

33:59.840 --> 34:01.200
This is so cool.

34:01.200 --> 34:04.880
JAMIE-LEE:
I am totally in love with her.

34:04.880 --> 34:07.040
(MAKES CLICKING SOUND)
..final dates...

34:07.040 --> 34:09.080
And I'll just show you a breath
that you can use

34:09.080 --> 34:10.840
to control the ejaculation.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.400
Interesting.
(BOTH LAUGH)

34:13.400 --> 34:16.200
..and final revelations.

34:16.200 --> 34:19.840
I wanted to ask you
if you have any reservation.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.200
There was actually one thing.

34:22.200 --> 34:25.760
Might be a good time to tell you...

34:25.760 --> 34:27.600
Oh!

34:27.600 --> 34:29.480
Then...

34:29.480 --> 34:30.800
BROOKE:
I'm really and utterly in love.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.720
Hi.

34:35.720 --> 34:38.160
I'm so madly in love.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.960
JAMIE-LEE: Today is the last day
that I'll spend with Brooke

34:50.960 --> 34:53.600
before I see her at the finale.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.880
And I'm not gonna lie.
Like, I'm really nervous.

34:56.880 --> 35:02.280
Because I feel like
meeting her friends didn't go well.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.800
I don't know
what they've said to Brooke.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.920
It's so important
that I clarify everything

35:06.920 --> 35:10.600
and I kind of want to
put Brooke's mind at ease.

35:10.600 --> 35:15.640
I am totally in love with her
and I'm looking at my future,

35:15.640 --> 35:18.160
you know, what I want,
and that's Brooke.

35:19.240 --> 35:20.920
Oh, hey, babe.

35:20.920 --> 35:23.320
You look good.
Back at ya.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.800
(BOTH LAUGH)
Hey, babe.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.280
How are you?
Good.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.000
Mmm.
How are you?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.520
I'm good.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.840
BROOKE: I've known Jamie-Lee
for a very long time,

35:32.840 --> 35:36.520
and I kind of pinch myself
that we've come this far.

35:36.520 --> 35:39.760
Yeah.
It feels like full circle for us.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.080
Come closer.
(LAUGHS)

35:41.080 --> 35:42.440
Ooh.

35:42.440 --> 35:45.720
BROOKE: Jamie-Lee did say
that she's in love with me,

35:45.720 --> 35:49.440
and I have intense
and strong feelings for Jamie-Lee.

35:49.440 --> 35:50.760
It's so good to see you.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.400
(LAUGHS)
Are you excited about today?

35:52.400 --> 35:55.160
It's our last...
I know. I'm nervous.

35:55.160 --> 35:56.800
Yeah. OK. I...I get it.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.960
Post, like, getting interrogated
by Amy and Abbie.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.160
It was a lot.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.280
It was a lot.
It's a lot.

36:02.280 --> 36:04.000
BROOKE: There's a couple of,
you know, questions

36:04.000 --> 36:06.240
that Jamie-Lee and I,
like, need to tease out

36:06.240 --> 36:07.720
from her meeting Abbie and Amy

36:07.720 --> 36:10.120
which I want to bring up later on.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.600
But today is about having fun,

36:11.600 --> 36:13.880
and I really want to
just live in our little moment.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.560
Like, I hope
you love today's date, because...

36:16.560 --> 36:18.040
..these are things that I love...

36:18.040 --> 36:20.040
OK.
..and see us doing.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.080
OK.

36:21.080 --> 36:22.920
So today, we're just gonna, like,
have fun with it.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.400
Fun.
You ready?
Yeah.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.400
OK.
Of course.

36:25.400 --> 36:29.120
This is about thrills
and adventure and adrenaline,

36:29.120 --> 36:32.200
and I'm pulling in
the big guns today, so...yeah.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.280
Cue the chopper.
(HELICOPTER WHIRRS)

36:36.120 --> 36:38.400
Here it comes.

36:38.400 --> 36:41.200
Oh, my God. This is so fun.

36:41.200 --> 36:46.120
JAMIE-LEE: I look up
and there's this insane helicopter.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.440
I'm actually so excited.

36:51.640 --> 36:55.400
And I've never been
on a helicopter before.

36:55.400 --> 36:56.680
Hello.
Hey.

36:56.680 --> 36:59.040
(LAUGHS)
JAMIE-LEE: So, what a first.

36:59.040 --> 37:02.160
Like, how...I feel like...
with Brooke, I've had a few firsts.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.400
(LAUGHS) This is so cool.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.160
JAMIE-LEE:
And it's, like, kind of nice

37:10.160 --> 37:14.560
I get to share this experience
with someone as special as Brooke.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.720
Wow!

37:16.720 --> 37:20.400
It's so romantic
being in the chopper with her,

37:20.400 --> 37:22.840
because I look at the view
and then I look at her,

37:22.840 --> 37:25.040
and I'm, like...

37:25.040 --> 37:26.040
(MAKES CLICKING SOUND)

37:28.560 --> 37:33.280
They're such beautiful views,
both parties.

37:35.760 --> 37:38.680
JAMIE-LEE: As we're, like,
coming down to land... (LAUGHS)

37:38.680 --> 37:41.320
..I can see in the distance
there are, like, two...

37:42.320 --> 37:44.600
..what look like motorbikes.

37:44.600 --> 37:47.800
OK, so...
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God.

37:47.800 --> 37:50.720
..I did say there are
a couple of adventure things.

37:50.720 --> 37:53.080
And...this is one of them.

37:53.080 --> 37:55.080
JAMIE-LEE: I'm, like,
trying to smile and act all cool,

37:55.080 --> 37:56.080
like, "Yeah, I've got this."

37:56.080 --> 37:57.960
I don't. I don't have this at all.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.160
Ready?

37:59.160 --> 38:00.720
Eee! No. (LAUGHS)

38:00.720 --> 38:02.200
You're fine. You got it.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.480
I'm so uncoordinated.

38:06.480 --> 38:07.800
Oh, God!

38:07.800 --> 38:09.120
You OK?

38:09.120 --> 38:11.400
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

38:11.400 --> 38:13.000
Watch the trees.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.800
(BOTH LAUGH)

38:17.640 --> 38:20.480
But it's actually a lot of fun.

38:20.480 --> 38:23.560
(LAUGHS) This is so fun.

38:23.560 --> 38:24.960
OK, ready? Let's fang it. (LAUGHS)

38:24.960 --> 38:26.720
(BOTH LAUGH)

38:29.280 --> 38:32.880
JAMIE-LEE: We're giggling -
like, it's just...it's so perfect.

38:32.880 --> 38:35.760
Whoo!
(BOTH LAUGH)

38:37.040 --> 38:42.000
BROOKE: I have never laughed so hard
in my life, like, on a bike.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.040
(BOTH LAUGH)

38:43.040 --> 38:45.440
I have said from the start
that I want a partner

38:45.440 --> 38:47.000
who's basically my best friend,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.120
and I feel like that's always been

38:49.120 --> 38:51.560
a bit of a standout for me
with Jamie-Lee.

38:51.560 --> 38:54.120
What more could you want?

39:00.080 --> 39:02.280
Isn't this magical?

39:03.280 --> 39:05.480
This is stunning.

39:05.480 --> 39:06.920
Oh. Look at that.
(LAUGHS)

39:06.920 --> 39:10.840
I have had the best day ever -
like, the best date ever.

39:10.840 --> 39:13.080
(BOTH LAUGH)

39:13.080 --> 39:15.680
(CORK POPS)
Whoo! Oop! There we go.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.040
What sucks is, like...

39:17.040 --> 39:19.280
..I feel like Amy's question,
Amy's worries,

39:19.280 --> 39:22.240
I don't know the details that
I should about Brooke's culture,

39:22.240 --> 39:25.280
has been weighing on my mind.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.960
Cheers to, like, our love story.
Yeah, I like that.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.760
Cheers.
Cheers.
(GLASSES CLINK)

39:29.760 --> 39:31.320
JAMIE-LEE:
And I've already told Brooke

39:31.320 --> 39:32.800
that, you know,
I'm in love with her,

39:32.800 --> 39:35.760
but tonight for me
isn't about saying that again.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.400
It's more about getting rid
of any doubt in her mind.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.600
I hope you enjoyed today's date.
Yeah, I think you know I did.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.200
Good.
Yeah.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.280
You've turned into
my little adventurous bush girl.

39:46.280 --> 39:47.880
(LAUGHS)

39:47.880 --> 39:50.400
I feel like I've always been
a little adventurous.

39:50.400 --> 39:53.800
It's just nice to be able
to show you a different side of me.

39:53.800 --> 39:57.440
But I wanted to ask you
if there's anything...

39:57.440 --> 39:59.400
..I guess now is, like, the time,

39:59.400 --> 40:01.680
if you have
any questions or reservations,

40:01.680 --> 40:06.200
anything in your head,
about us, about me, about anything.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.760
Um...

40:08.760 --> 40:10.480
..there was actually one thing...

40:10.480 --> 40:12.360
Mmm.
..that Amy actually brought up.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.840
Um...

40:14.840 --> 40:17.080
..she was, like, "I think...
I just want to know, make sure,

40:17.080 --> 40:20.400
"that Jamie-Lee, um...

40:20.400 --> 40:24.720
"..likes YOU, Brooke,
as who you are, not what you are

40:24.720 --> 40:26.840
"or, like, have this idea of you."

40:26.840 --> 40:29.000
She kind of said, like, you know,

40:29.000 --> 40:32.840
"There were a few things that
Jamie-Lee didn't know about you,"

40:32.840 --> 40:35.040
things that I would kind of
expect you, out of all people,

40:35.040 --> 40:37.480
to sort of know,
because you've known me the longest.

40:37.480 --> 40:38.760
Mmm.

40:38.760 --> 40:42.040
Um, so she was worried that
you didn't know the basics of, like,

40:42.040 --> 40:44.600
who I am on a cultural level.

40:44.600 --> 40:46.280
And, um... (SIGHS)

40:46.280 --> 40:48.520
..that's important to me.

40:48.520 --> 40:52.440
If it's important to you,
it's important to me, and...

40:52.440 --> 40:53.440
..and she is right.

40:53.440 --> 40:56.640
I should...I should know.
I'm sorry I...I don't.

40:56.640 --> 40:59.240
Like, I'm s...like, it's...
that's a fault of mine.

40:59.240 --> 41:00.720
It's not like I walk up to people

41:00.720 --> 41:03.040
and I'm, like,
"Hey. This is my tribe name."

41:03.040 --> 41:04.600
Mmm.
It's...yeah. I get it.

41:04.600 --> 41:08.200
But it's something
that I'd like to learn more about.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.560
And...
Mmm.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.600
..I will learn more.

41:13.320 --> 41:16.320
That's good. Thank you for that.

41:16.320 --> 41:19.960
This whole thing, like,
I've worn my heart on my sleeve,

41:19.960 --> 41:24.640
and I think that you
also know who I am and you trust me.

41:24.640 --> 41:27.000
I...I believe that. I do.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.480
And I hope that I show you
that I love, like, you know,

41:30.480 --> 41:33.280
finding out more about you
and learning about you.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.840
Because, you know...
Yeah.

41:34.840 --> 41:37.120
..I care,
and that, you know, I love you.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.120
Say it again.
And I love you.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.720
Oh.
(LAUGHS)

41:41.720 --> 41:42.840
Mmm.

41:50.360 --> 41:52.320
BROOKE: I think it was
really important for Jamie-Lee and I

41:52.320 --> 41:54.440
to really hash out these things

41:54.440 --> 41:57.760
in order for me
to be able to make my decision.

41:57.760 --> 41:58.760
I know what I want.

41:58.760 --> 42:01.560
What is that? What's that?
Take a guess.

42:01.560 --> 42:04.040
Is it me?
Yeah, of course.

42:04.040 --> 42:05.800
(BOTH LAUGH)

42:05.800 --> 42:09.480
BROOKE: And I do trust Jamie-Lee,
because she's always honest and open,

42:09.480 --> 42:13.000
but more importantly,
I'm gonna trust my heart, 'cause...

42:13.000 --> 42:15.920
..you know, when I'm hearing
that she's here for me and she w...

42:15.920 --> 42:18.680
..knows what she wants
and that's me, like...

42:18.680 --> 42:22.280
..I just...
I don't know, just feel it.

42:22.280 --> 42:24.480
I just come back to,
you know, the letter that I wrote,

42:24.480 --> 42:28.360
that what will be will be,
and I truly believe that, and I feel

42:28.360 --> 42:32.600
this is, like, going to be
one of the hardest goodbyes.

42:42.440 --> 42:45.400
JAMIE-LEE: After today,
I couldn't have done any more.

42:45.400 --> 42:46.760
I couldn't have said any more.

42:46.760 --> 42:50.400
I couldn't have told Brooke
how I feel any more.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.120
Come here.

42:53.400 --> 42:54.880
Come here.

42:54.880 --> 42:57.120
JAMIE-LEE:
I've tried to ask any questions

42:57.120 --> 42:59.760
about any worries
she might have about us,

42:59.760 --> 43:02.840
I've...I've tried to cover
every ground,

43:02.840 --> 43:06.200
so that she goes into this finale
knowing what I want

43:06.200 --> 43:09.640
and not having any doubt in her mind
about how I feel.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.120
What's wrong?

43:13.120 --> 43:16.800
Just...I'm thinking. Just happy.

43:28.960 --> 43:30.880
JAMIE-LEE: But I just hope...

43:30.880 --> 43:34.880
(LAUGHS) ..you know,
I really hope that that's enough.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.320
DARVID:
Today is my last date with Brooke,

43:55.320 --> 43:58.920
and it's definitely gonna be
the most important one.

43:58.920 --> 44:01.320
It's the last impression
that I leave on Brooke

44:01.320 --> 44:03.040
before she makes her decision.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.840
And I made a good first impression

44:04.840 --> 44:06.680
and I really want to make
a good last impression.

44:06.680 --> 44:08.280
So it's everything.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.040
Hello.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.480
What a woman.

44:34.480 --> 44:36.760
(LAUGHS) What a woman!
(BOTH LAUGH)

44:36.760 --> 44:39.760
If I can get my door open.
How do you open it? (LAUGHS)

44:39.760 --> 44:40.880
Lift.
(LAUGHS) Ugh!

44:40.880 --> 44:43.160
There we go.
There we go. A bit of muscle power.

44:43.160 --> 44:45.560
How are you?
Hey, good. You look stunning.

44:45.560 --> 44:47.000
Mmm!
Mwah!

44:47.000 --> 44:50.200
How are you?
Yeah, I'm really good.

44:50.200 --> 44:52.720
So today's date,
yeah, it has a bit of a theme.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.040
Sexy.
Sexy?

44:54.040 --> 44:55.360
Yeah.
OK.
We're going sexy.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.160
That's OK. OK. Good.
Is that cool?

44:57.160 --> 44:58.480
Yeah.
Are you...are you down?

44:58.480 --> 45:01.400
Yeah. Classic sexy. I like this.
(LAUGHS)

45:01.400 --> 45:03.120
You ready?
Yeah, let's do it.

45:03.120 --> 45:05.600
BROOKE: Darvid and I
have gone on a few dates,

45:05.600 --> 45:07.640
and every time
that we've gone on a date,

45:07.640 --> 45:10.320
my feelings
have definitely grown with him.

45:20.160 --> 45:22.960
It's not every day that
you get driven around in a classic

45:22.960 --> 45:25.520
by an absolute 10.

45:25.520 --> 45:27.600
An absolute 10, you reckon?

45:27.600 --> 45:28.600
Yep.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.920
We're off.

45:29.920 --> 45:32.280
BROOKE:
Today's date is a bit different

45:32.280 --> 45:34.920
to what Darvid and I
have done previously.

45:34.920 --> 45:37.720
We're gonna be quite close today.
Nice.

45:37.720 --> 45:39.760
Closer than we've ever been before.

45:39.760 --> 45:41.480
OK. Oh!

45:41.480 --> 45:45.680
I feel like both of us are uncovering
different layers about one another,

45:45.680 --> 45:48.680
and it's kind of, like...you know,
I'm ready to step it up a little bit.

45:48.680 --> 45:51.880
Whoo-hoo!

45:51.880 --> 45:55.720
Take it to the more physical side.
(LAUGHS)

45:55.720 --> 45:57.720
Without giving away too much.

46:02.280 --> 46:04.880
Come with me.

46:04.880 --> 46:06.600
Ooh.

46:06.600 --> 46:09.600
So...I'm just gonna kneel here,
so you can just kneel next to me.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.760
And this is...

46:11.760 --> 46:13.320
..Helena.

46:13.320 --> 46:16.480
Hi.
And she is a Tantra yogini.

46:16.480 --> 46:17.480
Wow.

46:17.480 --> 46:19.480
And she's gonna be
taking us through some stuff.

46:19.480 --> 46:20.920
Lovely to meet you both.
Nice to meet you.

46:20.920 --> 46:23.880
Hearing the word 'Tantric',
my mind goes straight to sex,

46:23.880 --> 46:26.000
but I know we won't be having sex,

46:26.000 --> 46:29.400
so I'm intrigued as to
what we will actually be doing.

46:29.400 --> 46:34.120
So, Tantra's about intimacy,
sexually blending with another,

46:34.120 --> 46:37.560
and doing that is just
incredibly powerful and beautiful.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.640
So we're gonna do some breathwork

46:39.640 --> 46:42.000
and then we're just gonna
move into some Tantric poses,

46:42.000 --> 46:44.400
and I'll just show you a breath
that you can use

46:44.400 --> 46:46.160
to control the ejaculation.

46:47.160 --> 46:49.040
Interesting.
(BOTH LAUGH)

46:49.040 --> 46:50.680
OK. We've gone there. Yep.

46:50.680 --> 46:52.960
Can't go back.
(BOTH LAUGH)

46:52.960 --> 46:54.560
Did that really just happen?
(LAUGHS)

46:54.560 --> 46:56.640
You get that vibration
through the two of you

46:56.640 --> 47:01.080
and light through the two of you
and it just...explodes.

47:01.080 --> 47:02.840
Yeah. Wow.

47:02.840 --> 47:04.320
Feeling open?
Excited. Yeah. Yeah.

47:04.320 --> 47:06.240
Feeling good?
Yeah.
Yeah?

47:06.240 --> 47:08.120
Oh, it's exciting.
I'm excited to get into this.
Me too.

47:08.120 --> 47:09.880
Yes.
OK.

47:09.880 --> 47:11.560
I've never done
anything like this before.

47:11.560 --> 47:13.880
I think I've just got to embrace it,
have fun with it.

47:13.880 --> 47:15.920
You're gonna put your legs
over the top of him,

47:15.920 --> 47:17.520
so let's shuffle in
a little bit closer.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.840
(LAUGHS)
Here we go.

47:19.840 --> 47:23.920
But...I'm a guy. There's lots
of things going through my mind.

47:23.920 --> 47:28.200
So...I'm really hoping I can
keep my excitement levels down.

47:28.200 --> 47:30.480
(LAUGHS)

47:31.640 --> 47:32.880
We want skin.

47:32.880 --> 47:34.880
Shirt off?
Yes, please.

47:34.880 --> 47:36.280
BROOKE:
Already, I'm really loving this.

47:36.280 --> 47:39.960
(LAUGHS) I mean, Darvid
ripping his shirt off is, like...

47:39.960 --> 47:41.680
..it's so hot.

47:41.680 --> 47:43.920
He is so hot.

47:43.920 --> 47:46.120
Oh. I died.

47:46.120 --> 47:47.240
I, like, died.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.800
We're gonna do
left hand up, right hand down.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.000
Left hand up.
OK.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.600
So that's gonna make a circuit...

47:52.600 --> 47:54.520
Yep.
..between your hearts.
Cute.

47:54.520 --> 47:56.440
And now, so you're gonna
look into the other's left eye.

47:56.440 --> 47:57.440
Mm-hm.

47:57.440 --> 48:01.520
So the left eye is what's gonna
take you deeper into their soul.

48:01.520 --> 48:04.880
We're gonna breathe in through
the nose and out through the mouth.

48:04.880 --> 48:07.600
Ah.

48:07.600 --> 48:09.880
You're gonna gently take the tongue
to the roof of the mouth

48:09.880 --> 48:11.880
and close the eyes.

48:11.880 --> 48:14.320
So this is the breath,
or part of the breath, we use

48:14.320 --> 48:16.800
to pull up the ejaculation
through the body.

48:16.800 --> 48:18.160
And then when you're breathing out,

48:18.160 --> 48:22.040
imagining it coming out
the crown of the head.

48:22.040 --> 48:24.880
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

48:24.880 --> 48:26.120
It's OK.
Sorry. (LAUGHS)

48:26.120 --> 48:29.920
Laughing.
(LAUGHS)

48:29.920 --> 48:32.000
(LAUGHS)
I'm just trying to keep it PG.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.320
You know, my family are watching.
(LAUGHS)

48:35.320 --> 48:36.680
Laughing's good.

48:36.680 --> 48:38.840
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

48:38.840 --> 48:41.800
I'm taking this really seriously,
I promise. I'm just, like...

48:41.800 --> 48:42.800
It's OK.
I'm relaxed.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.560
The energy comes off...
Ah.

48:44.560 --> 48:46.640
..and the energy will
come through your body as laughter.

48:46.640 --> 48:51.680
So when I orgasm, I laugh.
Yes. (LAUGHS)

48:51.680 --> 48:53.680
My brothers are gonna be, like...

48:56.240 --> 49:00.000
..but a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.080
So we're gonna put our right hand
on the other's heart.

49:03.080 --> 49:05.480
Right hand? On hearts? Yep.

49:05.480 --> 49:06.920
Yep.

49:06.920 --> 49:08.720
You can close your eyes if you like.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.520
Imagining
bringing light from the sky

49:10.520 --> 49:13.040
down through the crown of the head
on the in breath.

49:13.040 --> 49:17.560
DARVID: Going through the steps with
Helena is actually really relaxing.

49:21.160 --> 49:24.320
The breathwork's really powerful.

49:24.320 --> 49:26.680
Here we go.
(ALL LAUGH)

49:26.680 --> 49:27.880
Hello.

49:27.880 --> 49:28.920
Hello.
OK.

49:28.920 --> 49:30.960
So you go down and you kiss her
and you come back up,

49:30.960 --> 49:33.800
so this is
an actually making love...

49:33.800 --> 49:35.880
..position, one of my favourites.

49:35.880 --> 49:37.200
(ALL LAUGH)

49:37.200 --> 49:40.280
Helena's leading us
through different positions.

49:40.280 --> 49:42.560
Then we're gonna move into, uh,
what's called...I call koala.

49:42.560 --> 49:44.640
Cross your legs behind to hold on.

49:44.640 --> 49:47.760
OK? And you're
bringing her up with you this time.

49:47.760 --> 49:50.800
So as she comes up,
she comes up with you.

49:50.800 --> 49:52.960
(LAUGHS)
That's it. Beautiful.

49:52.960 --> 49:56.120
And...I've never been
this close to Brooke.

49:56.120 --> 49:58.440
So, what happens here
is all your chakras align.

49:58.440 --> 50:02.440
So again, we're gonna breathe in.

50:02.440 --> 50:04.720
And breathing out.
(EXHALES)

50:04.720 --> 50:09.120
DARVID: And I was a bit surprised
how connected this makes us feel.

50:09.120 --> 50:12.920
It's an absolutely amazing
bonding experience.

50:12.920 --> 50:15.640
We're just breathing,
wrapped up in each other.

50:15.640 --> 50:18.920
I completely forget where I am.

50:18.920 --> 50:20.320
It's...it's really nice.

50:29.760 --> 50:31.120
(WHISPERS)

50:52.760 --> 50:54.960
Oh!

50:54.960 --> 50:56.120
That's cosy.
Yeah.

50:56.120 --> 50:58.440
How good's today been?
Oh, my God.

50:58.440 --> 51:00.920
DARVID: After the Tantric yoga
and an awesome day,

51:00.920 --> 51:04.680
it's really reassuring
how I'm feeling towards Brooke.

51:04.680 --> 51:06.000
My feelings are stronger than ever.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.640
I kind of think...

51:07.640 --> 51:10.440
..from our first date
to, like, now...

51:10.440 --> 51:11.440
..like, the...

51:11.440 --> 51:12.440
The progression?
Yeah.

51:12.440 --> 51:14.040
Us sitting next to each other
in the helicopter.

51:14.040 --> 51:16.600
And you're going,
"Where are you from? Brisbane?"

51:16.600 --> 51:20.080
Now we're doing the koala. (LAUGHS)

51:20.080 --> 51:22.400
Wild.
To progression.

51:22.400 --> 51:25.440
DARVID:
We've been through so much, and...

51:25.440 --> 51:28.680
..it really feels like everything's
fallen into place for Brooke and I.

51:28.680 --> 51:30.880
But I know that
the day is coming towards an end,

51:30.880 --> 51:35.200
and she's got
a big decision to make, so...

51:35.200 --> 51:37.120
..I need to tell Brooke
exactly how I feel.

51:37.120 --> 51:39.360
I don't know -
I just feel really, like...

51:41.440 --> 51:45.800
..you know, it just feels right
doing stuff with you.

51:45.800 --> 51:47.480
Seriously.
(LAUGHS)

51:49.880 --> 51:53.080
Uh...I don't want
to get emotional, but...

51:53.080 --> 51:57.400
..it was, um,
pretty clear to me early on...

51:57.400 --> 51:59.960
..how special you were.

51:59.960 --> 52:02.600
I genuinely think you are...

52:02.600 --> 52:05.440
..so beautiful, wonderful.

52:05.440 --> 52:06.960
You'd be an amazing mum.

52:06.960 --> 52:09.400
You'd be an awesome partner.

52:10.800 --> 52:12.920
And...

52:12.920 --> 52:14.080
(BLEEP)!

52:14.080 --> 52:16.000
..that we'd be a really good team.

52:18.080 --> 52:20.360
Sorry. (LAUGHS)
That's alright.

52:24.200 --> 52:25.760
I think it's really nice
and really thoughtful

52:25.760 --> 52:27.240
that you think about those things.

52:27.240 --> 52:29.520
I don't know what to...

52:29.520 --> 52:31.000
That is the truth.

52:32.360 --> 52:34.440
Yeah. I'm all-in.

52:34.440 --> 52:38.160
BROOKE: I just feel like
Darvid just has no reservations.

52:38.160 --> 52:40.800
And it's, like, he's 100% in.

52:40.800 --> 52:43.800
There's no conditions with him.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.360
I mean that.

52:49.400 --> 52:51.920
BROOKE: It makes me emotional
'cause I've never had that.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.960
That's all I have ever wanted.

52:59.320 --> 53:01.120
(SIGHS)

53:02.200 --> 53:04.080
(SIGHS)

53:07.280 --> 53:10.040
Might be a good time to tell you...

53:12.800 --> 53:14.040
..I don't know if...

53:16.480 --> 53:19.120
..it's gonna come out right, but...

53:20.880 --> 53:22.040
..I...

53:24.880 --> 53:28.080
..I know I told you
that I was falling for you.

53:29.120 --> 53:32.160
But I have well and truly fallen.

53:33.800 --> 53:35.720
And...

53:35.720 --> 53:40.200
..I truly believe
that you are my person.

54:00.360 --> 54:01.760
Hmm?
I love you.

54:01.760 --> 54:03.960
What did you say?
I said I love you.

54:05.480 --> 54:07.320
(BLEEP)!

54:08.800 --> 54:10.440
(SIGHS)

54:10.440 --> 54:14.320
I honestly didn't even think
that, like, being, like, in...

54:14.320 --> 54:16.440
..I don't even...I...

54:16.440 --> 54:18.400
..I thought, you know, like,
being in love with someone

54:18.400 --> 54:20.800
or, like, finding,
like, true love or...

54:20.800 --> 54:22.280
..finding a soul mate

54:22.280 --> 54:24.800
was just, like, this kooky shit
that people used to just say,

54:24.800 --> 54:26.440
and it used to just be, like...

54:26.440 --> 54:28.880
(SNIFFLES) ..things that...

54:28.880 --> 54:34.880
..you know, it was, like, a fantasy,
and it felt so out of touch for me.

54:34.880 --> 54:37.280
But I've always felt
that I wanted that,

54:37.280 --> 54:39.560
and I came here hoping to find that.

54:39.560 --> 54:41.200
I didn't expect to find it.

54:41.200 --> 54:44.960
And it just hit me in the (BLEEP)
face like...like a ton of bricks.

54:44.960 --> 54:46.440
(LAUGHS)

54:46.440 --> 54:48.200
But I love it.

54:48.200 --> 54:50.320
And I love him, so...

54:50.320 --> 54:53.160
(SOBS) And I want to say it again.

54:54.160 --> 54:56.280
I just love him.

54:57.280 --> 54:59.000
I just do.

55:11.320 --> 55:14.880
and stream every episode on demand,
only on 10 play.

55:33.960 --> 55:37.240
BROOKE: I feel like everything
in the last couple of years,

55:37.240 --> 55:39.680
from doing this experience
the first time,

55:39.680 --> 55:42.520
has been building
into this one moment,

55:42.520 --> 55:44.600
and we're here, and we're at it.

55:45.920 --> 55:49.680
But it's...it is gonna completely
and utterly change my life.

55:50.960 --> 55:54.400
It is a huge risk that I'm taking.

55:54.400 --> 55:55.880
But love IS a risk.

55:57.920 --> 56:02.040
I feel like we're gonna have a really
beautiful life together, and...

56:02.040 --> 56:04.400
..I've never felt like this before
about someone,

56:04.400 --> 56:07.880
and that tells me a lot, because...

56:07.880 --> 56:10.880
..I do have to break someone's heart

56:10.880 --> 56:14.840
to still get what I deserve,

56:14.840 --> 56:17.160
and that's the hardest thing.

56:20.720 --> 56:26.360
But I just cannot wait to
tell this person how much I love them

56:26.360 --> 56:29.280
and how long I've loved them for.

56:31.040 --> 56:32.400
I love them.

56:32.400 --> 56:35.480
I'm really and utterly in love.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.960
JAMIE-LEE:
I believe that things will turn out

56:44.960 --> 56:46.360
exactly as they should,

56:46.360 --> 56:50.680
and I believe in my heart
that that's, you know, her and I.

56:54.640 --> 56:58.200
DARVID: I really do feel like
a perfect match for Brooke.

56:58.200 --> 57:00.960
I just want her to feel safe.

57:00.960 --> 57:03.320
She's told me before that...

57:03.320 --> 57:05.920
..she's got a really big fear
of not being loved,

57:05.920 --> 57:08.840
and that won't happen with me.

57:08.840 --> 57:10.920
I've already
fallen in love with her.

57:23.920 --> 57:25.120
(LAUGHS)

57:35.280 --> 57:37.320
Hello.

57:37.320 --> 57:38.760
Hey, Brooke.
Hi, Osher.

57:38.760 --> 57:40.160
How are you?

57:40.160 --> 57:41.560
I'm OK.

57:41.560 --> 57:43.600
You look a million bucks.

57:43.600 --> 57:45.360
You look as fantastic too.

57:45.360 --> 57:46.640
How are you?

57:47.640 --> 57:48.920
This experience has been amazing,

57:48.920 --> 57:50.560
nothing
that I've ever experienced before,

57:50.560 --> 57:55.360
and I'm so, so happy
that I've done this.

57:55.360 --> 57:59.840
On the night that you arrived on the
red carpet to be our Bachelorette,

57:59.840 --> 58:02.480
it was pretty clear to me
that you felt

58:02.480 --> 58:06.240
the weight and the responsibility
of the communities

58:06.240 --> 58:07.520
that see themselves in you.

58:07.520 --> 58:11.080
Absolutely. I really hope
that I've done them proud.

58:11.080 --> 58:12.960
(SNIFFLES) Ooh!

58:12.960 --> 58:16.200
And I really hope that...

58:16.200 --> 58:19.000
..I...I came in here
and I did have, um,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.200
a lot of pressure
and a lot of responsibility,

58:21.200 --> 58:23.880
but the main part
was a responsibility of myself

58:23.880 --> 58:26.280
in coming out of this
with exactly what I wanted

58:26.280 --> 58:28.320
and the reason
why I came in here for,

58:28.320 --> 58:30.480
and I love that I can say
that I can leave with that happily

58:30.480 --> 58:32.760
and knowing...

58:32.760 --> 58:35.440
..I'm so deserving
of unconditional love,

58:35.440 --> 58:39.760
regardless of gender, regardless
of race, regardless of anything.

58:39.760 --> 58:44.120
I feel like I have found someone
in this experience.

58:44.120 --> 58:45.920
Phew! (CLEARS THROAT)

58:45.920 --> 58:50.080
I honestly can't tell you how
I feel about this person in words.

58:50.080 --> 58:53.200
Sometimes it...I'm...yeah.

58:53.200 --> 58:55.800
I'm, like, utterly in love. (LAUGHS)

58:55.800 --> 58:59.040
It's gross, but I love it. (LAUGHS)

58:59.040 --> 59:01.880
I'm so happy for you.
That's what you came here for.

59:01.880 --> 59:04.400
When I truly look at what I have
with this person,

59:04.400 --> 59:06.960
I absolutely, like,
adore it and I love it,

59:06.960 --> 59:09.920
and I feel like
it is exactly what...

59:09.920 --> 59:12.960
..I wanted, and more. (LAUGHS)

59:12.960 --> 59:14.680
And, like, more and more.

59:14.680 --> 59:16.160
(LAUGHS)

59:16.160 --> 59:17.800
I'm really happy.

59:17.800 --> 59:21.960
Part of this moment is letting
that person know how you feel.

59:21.960 --> 59:22.960
Mmm.

59:22.960 --> 59:26.200
Part of this moment is also letting
another person know how you feel.

59:26.200 --> 59:27.960
I know. (SIGHS)

59:27.960 --> 59:30.720
And I think that's
really weighing on me heavily.

59:30.720 --> 59:32.520
I think...

59:32.520 --> 59:34.440
..it's gonna be...

59:34.440 --> 59:36.600
..hugely difficult.

59:36.600 --> 59:38.400
But I... (SIGHS)

59:38.400 --> 59:40.000
..I know exactly why I came here

59:40.000 --> 59:43.480
and I know exactly what I...
I'm leaving with.

59:43.480 --> 59:45.400
I'm ready.
You're ready?
I'm ready.

59:45.400 --> 59:46.400
Alright.

59:46.400 --> 59:48.120
Thank you.
Good luck.

59:48.120 --> 59:49.360
I'll go get them now.

59:49.360 --> 59:52.080
OK. Appreciate that. (SIGHS)

I will be...

1:00:12.960 --> 1:00:14.680
..heartbroken.

1:00:15.920 --> 1:00:18.960
Yeah,
it'd be absolutely devastating.

1:00:22.120 --> 1:00:25.560
JAMIE-LEE: All I've ever wanted,
you know, is...is her,

1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:29.320
and now I'm here and, it's, like...
I'm so close. (LAUGHS)

1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:44.680
It's OK. You're alright.

You're OK.

1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:49.200
Um...

1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:53.160
..when we met three years ago...

1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:56.520
..there was an instant connection.

1:01:56.520 --> 1:02:00.440
Since then,
I feel like we never really

1:02:00.440 --> 1:02:04.680
got to experience
a relationship outside,

1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:08.440
and it's always seemed like
a very sliding door moment...

1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:12.680
..until you rocked up
on the red carpet,

1:02:12.680 --> 1:02:14.000
and I saw you there,

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.400
and you got out of that limo
with that white dress on

1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:18.880
and you came up and you read me

1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:21.320
that letter that you left me
in that first experience.

1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:24.200
(BREATHES SHAKILY)

1:02:24.200 --> 1:02:26.400
It's OK. It's alright.

1:02:31.560 --> 1:02:34.360
I absolutely think...

1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:35.480
You're OK.

inside and out,

1:02:41.760 --> 1:02:46.920
and you make me feel
like the only girl in the world.

1:02:50.560 --> 1:02:54.480
I really, really love exploring...

1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:04.400
..our beautiful love story.

1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:08.400
But, unfortunately, it's not ours.

1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:11.640
And I...

1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:14.320
..and my heart is... (SNIFFLES)

1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:30.680
(SIGHS)

1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:33.200
You're alright. You're alright.

1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:35.200
(SNIFFLES)

1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:37.640
It's OK.

1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:42.160
I really am happy for you.

1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:44.960
(SNIFFLES)

1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:48.800
I feel lucky to have
had this chance with you, and...

..what we had...

1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:58.400
..was beautiful.

1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:01.880
I don't...
It's OK.

1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:04.240
Thank you. (LAUGHS)
Thank you.

1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:05.720
It's OK.

It's not how I saw things going.

1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:26.480
I feel lucky that I was given
the chance to have my final shot.

1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:28.400
You know, like...

1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:31.560
..if I didn't come here and
I didn't explore this with Brooke,

1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:34.680
I wouldn't have been able
to close this chapter.

1:05:35.680 --> 1:05:38.080
I'm sad it ended this way.

(SIGHS) ..loving something
so unconditionally

1:06:26.920 --> 1:06:28.800
and knowing that it loves you back.

1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:33.960
Like, I love him so much, and...

1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:35.800
..he is...

1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:38.840
..the most beautiful man
I've ever met.

1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:46.120
I know everything that he says,
he says with serious conviction,

1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:51.000
and I know that
everything that he does and will do

1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:54.440
not for me but for us...

1:06:54.440 --> 1:06:58.760
..I feel like we're gonna have
a really beautiful life together.

Hi.
Hey.

1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:03.760
BROOKE:
I'm just so excited to tell him,

1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:07.720
like, how I really and truly
and utterly feel about him.

1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:10.320
I'm really and utterly in love.

1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:13.880
I'm so madly in love.

1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:17.400
Darvid. (LAUGHS)

1:07:17.400 --> 1:07:20.840
From...the moment I met you
on the red carpet

1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:24.080
and you came off that lawnmower,

1:07:24.080 --> 1:07:29.160
you left a massive impression on me.

1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:33.560
And...I feel like I, uh...

1:07:33.560 --> 1:07:36.280

1:07:36.280 --> 1:07:37.680
It's alright.

1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:42.320
Um...

1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:45.880
Oh! (SIGHS)

1:07:47.280 --> 1:07:49.360
You got this.

1:07:49.360 --> 1:07:51.360
(SIGHS)

1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:53.680
I don't know.
Love for me, it's just...

1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:55.960
Oh, I can't...
(LAUGHS) I'm really sorry.

1:07:55.960 --> 1:07:57.920
I'm so sorry.
It's alright.

1:07:57.920 --> 1:07:59.640
I'm really, like...

1:07:59.640 --> 1:08:02.240
Squeezing my hands.
God.

1:08:05.680 --> 1:08:07.240
OK.

1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:16.320
Come here.

1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:18.080
Oh. (SOBS)

1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:21.640
(LAUGHS)

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:28.520
OK.
Don't stress.

1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:30.360
I want to get this out.
You got it.

1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:31.360
OK.

1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:34.080
(SIGHS)
From the moment I met you, I, um...

1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:35.880
..I felt a lot of feelings.

1:08:35.880 --> 1:08:37.760
I felt...

1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:40.000
..I felt calm, I felt trusting.

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:43.640
I felt that...
an instant chemistry and connection

1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:46.360
that I never, ever felt
with anyone before.

1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:50.960
(SIGHS) Darvid.

1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:53.040
I'm just gonna, like...

1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:55.640
Look, I don't know
how to say this, but...

1:08:55.640 --> 1:08:58.760
..you came in here
and you granted me three wishes.

1:08:58.760 --> 1:09:00.040
Mm-hm.

1:09:00.040 --> 1:09:02.680
And I still have one left.

1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:07.440
(SNIFFLES)

1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:10.360

Mmm?

1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:11.840
(SIGHS)

1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:13.520
Will you...

1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:16.720
..make me the happiest...girl...

1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:17.920
(SOBS)

1:09:17.920 --> 1:09:19.600
Of course.

1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:21.680
(SOBS)

1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:27.000
I love you so much.

1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:28.440
And I love you.

1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.960
I'm sorry. (SOBS)

1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:36.920
(EXHALES)
I'm so sorry that I...

1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:39.920
(LAUGHS) Don't be sorry.
(SIGHS)

1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:41.880
I just...I really wanted to get it...

1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:45.280
..all my words out and right,
and I just...I can't with you.

1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:48.600
And it's what you do to me
all the time.

1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:50.520
(SIGHS) You make me so happy.

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:52.920
I actually
have something for you, though,

1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:54.320
just to, like...

1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:55.960
(EXHALES)
(SIGHS)

1:09:55.960 --> 1:09:58.800
..maybe my...it would be better
for my words to, like...

1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:01.400
It... (LAUGHS)

1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:04.120
(LAUGHS)
(SIGHS)

1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:05.280
Look at me.

1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:07.440
I love you.

1:10:10.040 --> 1:10:13.600
I just wanted to give you something
'cause I'm not that great at words.

1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:16.080
(BOTH SPEAK INDISTINCTLY)

1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:18.960
So, and I wanted to give you
a little something just to show you

1:10:18.960 --> 1:10:21.560
that I love you so much.

1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:23.240
Oh.
You want to put it on there?

1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:24.560
Yeah.
This one?
Yes.

1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:27.280
It's gonna fit?
Perfect.

1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:46.240
And I can't wait
to start our life together.

1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:48.240
Mm-hm. Me too.

1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:50.280
(SIGHS) I...

1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:52.120
..genuinely...

1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:55.360
..have known
from the first moment I met you,

1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:57.440
it was gonna be the start
of something special.

1:10:57.440 --> 1:10:58.920
I've...

1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:01.560
..completely fallen in love
with you, as you know.

1:11:01.560 --> 1:11:04.040
I want you to always feel loved.

1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:07.440
And I want you
to always feel supported.

1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:10.600
I wanted to get you
a little something to show you

1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:13.120
that I...will be there for you.

1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:15.320
I will love you no matter what.

1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:18.040
So...
You're much better than I am.

1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:20.560
Cute. Whoa.

1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:21.960
Cute.

1:11:21.960 --> 1:11:24.800
Wow. That's...oh, good choice.

1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:26.640
I love you.
Mmm.

1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:40.800
You're so special.

1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:44.480
I love you so much.
