Break his index finger
and dislocate his thumb,

08:23.170 --> 08:26.936

11:25.650 --> 11:27.641
I'm not gonna
help you find her.

11:27.680 --> 11:31.480
I'm gonna hunt her down,
and I'm gonna kill her myself.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.556
And the next time
I see your face,

11:33.590 --> 11:36.081
I'm gonna Shoot
before you can start talking.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.623
TOO soon, the comment
about the wife?

11:39.560 --> 11:42.097
(CHUCKLES)
Good talk.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.620
**

11:45.700 --> 11:46.997
I told you.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.792
Yeah, you were right.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.899
But we had to try.

11:50.940 --> 11:52.976
And now he's forced
our hand.

11:53.340 --> 11:55.331
**

11:55.380 --> 11:58.508
Sir. Sir, there is nothing
on Thelonious Prackett.

11:58.550 --> 12:00.211
It's... It's got to be
an alias.

12:00.250 --> 12:03.310
But whoever he is,
he agreed to let
Mrs. Radcliffe

12:03.350 --> 12:05.238
recommend a new member.
Did you tell Ressler?

12:05.290 --> 12:06.985
Prackett agreed
on one condition,

12:07.020 --> 12:09.614
that _if the new member
gets inVIted to an event,

12:09.660 --> 12:10.979
Radcliffe has to go with.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.383
That'll be all right
as long as Ressler is

12:12.430 --> 12:13.829
with her
the whole time.

12:13.860 --> 12:16.158
Yeah, um, about that.
If, um...

12:17.730 --> 12:20.790
If we're doing this,
I'd like to go with her.

12:20.840 --> 12:21.898
Instead Of Ressler.

12:21.940 --> 12:24.329
We need to be a convincing
couple to have a connection,

12:24.370 --> 12:28.636
and we have one...
I can relate to her loss.

12:28.680 --> 12:29.704
Samar.

12:29.740 --> 12:32.300
Not that what I went through
even compares.

12:32.350 --> 12:33.942
You went through plenty.

12:35.050 --> 12:36.540
I'm sorry I haven't asked you
about it more.

12:36.580 --> 12:38.741
I'm fine.

12:38.790 --> 12:42.920
Um, still a bit, uh, numb,
(CHUCKLES) I guess.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.827
But, um, when the last
real feeling you had
was devastation,

12:45.860 --> 12:49.250
you're not super psyched
to get out there
and feel again.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.519
But... I'm good.
I'm good.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.890
I agree.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.567
That I'm good, or...
Or devastated?

12:56.600 --> 12:58.329
That you should
go with her.

12:58.370 --> 13:00.600
Work on your cover,
you're going in.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.232

13:03.110 --> 13:04.099
Greetings!

13:05.610 --> 13:07.271
Where are we going?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.719
And why do I
have to gO with you?

13:08.750 --> 13:11.116
Because you remain
in my debt.

13:11.150 --> 13:12.219
I saved your life.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.115
Yes, after
putting it at risk.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.754
And I told you
about Steinhil's contract
with Les Fleurs du Mal.

13:16.790 --> 13:17.927
Why aren't you
looking at them?

13:17.960 --> 13:20.690
I've got people
working on that.

13:20.730 --> 13:23.392
I'm supposed to be at dinner
tonight at The Peppermill.

13:23.430 --> 13:24.966
It's my wedding anniversary.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.639
Congratulations!
That shouldn't be a problem.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.594
You're holding me hostage.

13:29.640 --> 13:33.132
I prefer to think Of it
as looking out
for my best interests.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.432
Please, find yourself
another seat.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.301
Relax. Read a book.
Watch a movie.

13:38.350 --> 13:42.138
DO you like Truffaut?
We have
the complete collection.

13:42.180 --> 13:44.182
**

13:49.090 --> 13:50.557
What did Stevenson say?

13:50.590 --> 13:54.196
The room is being swept.
He can't get a camera in.

13:54.230 --> 13:56.448
Someone from
the hotel staff, then.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.060
Surely we can
incentivize a maid

13:59.100 --> 14:01.660
or someone from room service
to take a photo.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.168
They're only allowing
authorized personnel.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.428
We're too late to get anyone
on the inside.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.129
Can I ask you something?

14:09.210 --> 14:12.179
"Day for Night."
Definitely.
The photograph.

14:12.210 --> 14:13.643
Oh, that's none
Of your concern.

14:13.680 --> 14:17.343
If I got it for you,
would my debt be paid?

14:18.390 --> 14:19.641
Conceivably.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.479
ARAM: We met at Ascot.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.829
I had a horse racing
in the Dubai Shergar Cup.

14:24.860 --> 14:26.054
And how did he do?

14:26.090 --> 14:28.797
Fractured his
left-front pastern.
Had to be put down.

14:28.830 --> 14:30.525
Cost me $300,000
in stud fees.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.696
Per stud?

14:31.730 --> 14:34.995
Forty studs a year,
that's $12 million per year.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.632
That must have been
a dark day.

14:36.670 --> 14:38.206
Until I saw Elodie.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.834
Things brightened considerably
after that.

14:41.540 --> 14:42.700
(CHUCKLES)

14:43.580 --> 14:45.138
How is Charles?

14:46.550 --> 14:50.816
The man I married is alive,
but my husband is gone.

14:50.850 --> 14:53.159
And our role
in that tragedy?

14:53.190 --> 14:54.509
I don't hold you
responsible,

14:54.560 --> 14:56.312
if that's
what you're asking.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.657
He wanted the risk.

14:58.090 --> 14:59.523
We both did.

14:59.560 --> 15:02.393
Well, I know you did.
I'm surprised you still do.

15:02.430 --> 15:04.523
I didn't.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.164
For a long time, I thought
I never would again.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.032
Then I met Shameel.

15:12.010 --> 15:14.137
I was a guest
in one of the royal boxes,

15:14.180 --> 15:15.909
and she was
three rows below,

15:15.940 --> 15:19.103
and still the peacock feathers
in her hat blocked my view.

15:19.780 --> 15:20.849
(CHUCKLES)

15:20.880 --> 15:23.314
Ah. (SIGHS)

15:23.350 --> 15:27.559
Your interest is unusual.

15:27.590 --> 15:30.479
I don't see why.
I can buy anything I want.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.419
So, naturally what I want is
something I cannot buy.

15:33.460 --> 15:36.020
It's unusual_
because it COinCIdes

15:36.060 --> 15:37.869
with an upcoming event.

15:39.130 --> 15:40.495
Why is that unusual?

15:40.540 --> 15:43.065
Because we _haven't issued
inVItations yet.

15:44.410 --> 15:49.939
Which makes your interest
an unusual coincidence,
or worse,

15:49.980 --> 15:52.904
not a coincidence at all.

15:52.950 --> 15:55.919
I understand your caution
and why you need

15:55.950 --> 15:58.180
to vet your guests
as closely as you do.

15:58.220 --> 16:00.688
I would expect
nothing less.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.017
But we've told you
our story,

16:02.060 --> 16:03.721
we've exchanged
wiring instructions,

16:03.760 --> 16:05.057
and I'm one text away

16:05.090 --> 16:07.229
from depositing $1 million
into your account.

16:07.260 --> 16:11.469
The Defiance is an experience
money can't buy.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.968
Of course not, which is why
I'm all the more happy

16:14.000 --> 16:16.434
to pay for it.
So, I need to know...

16:16.470 --> 16:19.405
Are we in,
or are we out?

16:19.440 --> 16:21.408
**

16:26.150 --> 16:29.313
Welcome to
Les Fleurs du Mal.

16:29.350 --> 16:31.113

16:37.130 --> 16:38.188
I'm confused.

16:38.230 --> 16:39.879
We have no idea
where we're gOing,

16:39.930 --> 16:41.955
who will be there,
or how to get out.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.490
I mean, we don't even know
how to get to this event.

16:43.530 --> 16:45.122
Prackett said
he'd send instructions.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.819
Which he hasn't.
He will.

16:46.870 --> 16:50.237
We sold our story well,
but if you're uncomfortable...

16:50.270 --> 16:52.761
I am. Because I...
(SIGHS)

16:52.810 --> 16:54.607
Look, I don't
quite understand the plan.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.631
Can we gO over it again?

16:56.680 --> 16:59.774
The location of the event is
a closely guarded secret.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.119

will be on your own.

17:02.150 --> 17:05.085

makes contact, you'll follow
his instructions.

17:05.120 --> 17:07.918

know where we're going,
and you can't follow us,

17:07.960 --> 17:09.518
how do you plan
to find our location?

17:09.560 --> 17:11.289
ARAM: With an ELT beacon.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.059
We'll smuggle
the device in disassembled

17:13.100 --> 17:14.920
so we can get it
past security.

17:14.960 --> 17:15.995
Disassembled.

17:16.030 --> 17:17.793
You're going to
wear the device

17:17.830 --> 17:20.469
into the building in pieces.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.264
COOPER: Once inside,
Aram will assemble the device,

17:23.310 --> 17:26.438
activate the signal,
and it'll give our team
your location.

you get the Signal...

and get you.

Okay. I get it.
