WEBVTT

00:16.200 --> 00:18.200
The bash-tastic!

00:18.280 --> 00:20.200
Mangle going down.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.240
Step aside, Clubber.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.480
Got to show Mangle my whirl-hitzer move.

00:26.240 --> 00:27.320
Not yet, Rotor.

00:28.280 --> 00:34.080
Right, because now I'm going to show him
my tempest thump move.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.440
Hold on. Not your turn either, Burst.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.160
Okay, Clubber, pulverize him.
Grab the thudball!

00:40.240 --> 00:43.760
[chuckles] Team Veredus thinks
their prized Mangle's special.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.720
But he's no match
for Team Capra's Combatabots.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.120
That's it, Clubber.
Just like in a real Robozuna game.

00:50.440 --> 00:52.400
Your opponent is not your friend.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.160
He's your enemy. Take him down!

00:57.480 --> 00:58.560
Excellent.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.800
And when you see the real Mangle,
do the same thing.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.400
Pulverise him!

01:46.640 --> 01:50.360
Mangle got surprise,
battle-blocker shield!

02:02.240 --> 02:04.840
Ha! Battle-blocker... fun!

02:06.840 --> 02:08.280
Making friends, Mangle?

02:08.360 --> 02:11.960
Huh? No. Centurions not friends.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.320
-That was a joke, Mangle.
-Ah, joke. Yes.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.400
Mangle friend all Centurions.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.480
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

02:22.080 --> 02:26.920
[sighs] Seriously, great job, Mangle,
and I've got the holo-disk we came for.

02:27.440 --> 02:32.000
Ooh. Always wanted one of these.
Now, better get out of here.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.720
[Lanista] Stay in there, Spark.
Use your taser-jab.

02:42.280 --> 02:45.840
Clunk, the bash-tastic,
that's Clubber's signature move.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.720
[grunts and groans]

02:53.680 --> 02:55.640
[electronic squeal and tyres screech]

03:04.880 --> 03:07.720
Ariston, Mangle, nice of you to show up.

03:08.200 --> 03:12.600
Morning to you, too, Lanista.
Got the blueprints to the Corvus Workcamp.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.160
You mean prison.

03:14.240 --> 03:17.640
-You're late for Robozuna practice.
-And you're welcome.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.120
Hm. Any problems getting this?

03:21.200 --> 03:25.480
A couple, but Mangle took care of them
and we got a souvenir.

03:25.560 --> 03:28.920
Whoa-ho!
Thought that was a Corvus Taser-Staff.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.280
Always wanted one of these.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.480
So, we're ready to put your plan
into action.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.480
-Break in, rescue Feronia and--
-Not yet.

03:38.560 --> 03:42.400
There's something else we're going to need
and I think I know where to get it, but--

03:42.480 --> 03:47.120
But in case you forgot, our Robozuna game
against Team Capra is tomorrow.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.840
-We need Mangle in the line-up.
-He's ready.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.680
And wait till you see
what Chike made for him.

03:52.760 --> 03:55.480
I call it the battle-blocker!

03:55.560 --> 03:57.360
Go ahead, Mangle. Show him!

04:02.120 --> 04:04.240
Already? [sighs] You broke it already?

04:05.520 --> 04:08.960
Mangle not break it.
Centurion's head break it.

04:10.960 --> 04:14.080
-[sighs] The servos is damaged. [groans]
-No worries.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.560
We can get replacements
at Trader Brex's Bits & Bots.

04:17.640 --> 04:18.560
Then hurry.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.760
Mangle needs to get in some more
Robozuna practice before the game.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.480
A lot more!

04:23.960 --> 04:27.000
I'd better go with them.
Make sure they stay out of trouble.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.080
Livia!

04:29.480 --> 04:31.280
Right. Won't be needing this.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.720
Bye, Dad.

04:44.560 --> 04:48.480
So, now what are we going to do?
No one has the servos you need.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.480
-Well, we could--
-[Tesh] Ariston?

04:51.920 --> 04:53.400
Ariston, is that you?

04:53.880 --> 04:56.120
-Tesh?
-You know her?

04:56.600 --> 04:59.000
-Just an old friend.
-Pretty friend.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.320
Wasn't sure I'd ever see you again, ever.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.320
[Mangle] Aw.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.400
[chuckles] And, Mangle,
you big handsome hydraulic hunk.

05:14.320 --> 05:17.240
Sorry...
about what happened to your home...

05:17.760 --> 05:19.040
to Feronia.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.600
Uh... I'm Tesh.

05:22.680 --> 05:23.560
Livia.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.800
Livia's dad runs Team Veredus.
We live with them now.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.560
-Mangle's officially a Combatabot!
-No way!

05:30.640 --> 05:34.560
Way! And we've got a Robozuna game
tomorrow, if you want to come.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.800
I'd love to,
but just bought that recycler workbot.

05:38.120 --> 05:42.240
Got to get him back to camp.
I'm calling him Compact.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.360
Target identified.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.360
Tracker in position.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.720
I'm part of a small band
of lightning harvesters.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.720
We're not Corvus-certified.
Can't afford their greedy fees.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.840
They demand most of the profit
and there's not that much to go around.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.360
And because you can't pay,
you're considered outlaws.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.040
Which is why I can't hang around.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.400
A little rusty. Needs a lot of work.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.040
That's okay. I've got plenty of bot parts
to make the repairs.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.280
Fact, I've got some servos
that ought to fix Mangle.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.200
-Really?
-Come with me.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.280
We could do a little robo-repairs,
like in the old days.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.600
Mangle help, too.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.960
I don't think so. We've got to practise
for tomorrow's game and--

06:28.040 --> 06:29.480
And you worry too much.

06:29.560 --> 06:32.800
Promise, won't take long
and Tesh will drive us back to camp.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.000
It'll be nice to see you again.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.800
My truck's over there.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.080
[grunting]

06:50.160 --> 06:52.720
Clubber, bash-tastic!

06:52.800 --> 06:54.560
[laughter]

06:54.640 --> 06:55.840
That'd hurt!

06:55.920 --> 06:57.640
Like what you see?

06:57.720 --> 07:01.520
Come to the Robozuna game tomorrow
at Lixus Arena!

07:05.400 --> 07:06.520
Mangle!

07:08.440 --> 07:09.880
Must pulverise!

07:10.760 --> 07:13.400
Clubber, not now. Centurions.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.800
Mangle, dead meat!

07:21.760 --> 07:25.200
Mangle, not friend. Enemy.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.760
Must destroy Mangle.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.240
Hey, hey! Save it for the arena.

07:31.640 --> 07:33.640
Clubber, stop. You make trouble.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.920
Ooh! Ooh! Do they need parting?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.200
Free game!

07:37.760 --> 07:39.800
-[man 1] Get a thud ball!
-[man 2] Mangle!

07:39.880 --> 07:41.880
-[man 3] Clubber.
-[man 4] Mangle!

07:41.960 --> 07:44.480
-[man 1] Let 'em battle!
-[man 3] Let 'em fight it out!

07:44.560 --> 07:47.840
Orders received. Defuse fight.
Allow target to leave.

07:48.120 --> 07:50.720
Bring it. Show me what you got.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.160
Oh, come on! Let 'em battle!

07:59.000 --> 08:01.560
Huh. Chike, not be happy.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.240
Halt!

08:04.280 --> 08:09.840
Combatabots, you are in violation
of Corvus code 944, disturbing the peace.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.760
-Mangle! Stop!
-Hurry!

08:16.920 --> 08:18.000
I'll handle this.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.800
What... What's that?

08:25.720 --> 08:26.760
Venom Bot!

08:27.920 --> 08:29.800
Mangle, stop!

08:31.440 --> 08:34.280
Huh. Clubber got screw lose.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.520
Mangle, stop!

08:36.600 --> 08:37.480
Freeze!

08:37.840 --> 08:38.720
Ah!

08:40.200 --> 08:41.600
Wha... What?

08:55.120 --> 08:56.520
Welcome to my home.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.240
[grunts]

08:59.320 --> 09:02.760
Compact... heavy for small bot. [grunts]

09:03.320 --> 09:05.560
-What’s under the tarp?
-What we harvest.

09:12.280 --> 09:13.880
[laughs heartily]

09:13.960 --> 09:16.680
-Tickle.
-We supply energy to those who need it.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.720
In return, they supply us
with the things we need.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.400
As long as Corvus never finds out,
everyone is able to survive.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.280
Uh-oh. This is bad.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.920
He’s worse off than expected?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.320
No. We are.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.400
A Corvus tracking device.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.120
Corvus! They know we're here!

09:36.200 --> 09:37.760
Prepare to roll out!

09:42.040 --> 09:42.960
[rumbling]

09:43.040 --> 09:44.800
Tesh! Corvus Airship!

09:47.160 --> 09:49.280
[sighs] Keeps getting better.

09:49.360 --> 09:53.160
This is my fault you're caught up
in all this. Take my truck. Go!

09:53.240 --> 09:56.400
No. I'm not letting what happened
to Feronia happen to you.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.600
I’m staying to fight!

10:02.560 --> 10:05.400
Mangle stay, too. Mangle protect!

10:12.280 --> 10:13.760
[buzz of static interference]

10:13.840 --> 10:17.400
-[Ariston] <i>Livia! Can you hear me?</i>
-Afraid so.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.560
<i>I'm in trouble!</i>

10:18.640 --> 10:22.920
What this time? Wait, don't tell.
You broke your friend's new workbot?

10:23.000 --> 10:27.600
<i>No. We're about to be attacked.</i>
<i>Corvus Airship approaching fast.</i>

10:29.240 --> 10:30.360
[tyres screech]

10:32.880 --> 10:35.720
Ariston! Ariston, where are you?

10:35.800 --> 10:37.840
<i>-We're...</i>
-Ariston!

10:37.920 --> 10:40.200
Get out of there! Ariston!

10:44.120 --> 10:45.320
[tyres screech]

10:51.360 --> 10:52.560
Head for the rocks!

10:55.480 --> 10:57.840
-[bleeping and static interference]
-Reception's bad.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.720
It's no use. Got cut off!

11:05.800 --> 11:08.800
It's the airship's engines.
They create a static field.

11:13.120 --> 11:16.600
Can't get a signal out!
It's just you and me, Mangle.

11:17.480 --> 11:18.560
Huh!

11:22.720 --> 11:24.000
Target sighted.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.120
[bleeping]

11:26.160 --> 11:27.480
Target locked.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.120
Tesh! Tesh!

11:42.200 --> 11:43.400
[groans]

11:43.480 --> 11:46.720
I'm okay. Just a little banged up and...

11:47.480 --> 11:48.960
[grunts]

11:49.040 --> 11:51.600
I'm stuck. I can't move.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.680
Hold on! We'll get you out.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.280
-[woman] Hurry! Incoming!
-[man] Stay down!

12:16.120 --> 12:18.040
Mangle going to make friends!

12:18.640 --> 12:21.480
Mangle, friend all Centurions!

12:22.440 --> 12:24.560
[chuckles] Mangle make joke.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.040
Mangle has a sense of humour?

12:27.960 --> 12:29.080
[Ariston] Long story.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.080
Here, lightning grenades.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.400
Don't waste them. That's all we have.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.680
-Let's go!
-Run!

12:39.760 --> 12:41.640
Get to the rocks! Run!

12:44.520 --> 12:46.400
[grunts]

12:52.800 --> 12:54.080
Compact!

13:00.400 --> 13:01.360
[grunts]

13:07.400 --> 13:08.520
Surprised, huh?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.200
[explosion]

13:28.520 --> 13:29.400
How the...

13:38.680 --> 13:40.080
Surprised, huh?

13:41.960 --> 13:44.320
Split up! Assault mode 81!

13:55.840 --> 13:57.440
This is almost too easy!

14:13.960 --> 14:17.760
[grunts and gasps]

14:17.840 --> 14:18.800
Tesh!

14:28.680 --> 14:32.320
Hoo-hoo! Thought you might come in handy.
Let's see what else you can do.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.000
[grunts]

14:39.240 --> 14:40.440
Nice to see you again.

14:54.040 --> 14:54.920
Freeze.

14:57.440 --> 15:01.160
-Whoa! What just happened?
-Venom-bots.

15:07.560 --> 15:10.560
[chuckles heartily]

15:10.640 --> 15:13.160
-Freeze!
-[chuckles] Tickle!

15:13.240 --> 15:14.920
Freeze! Freeze!

15:15.000 --> 15:16.760
[chuckles heartily]

15:23.320 --> 15:25.040
Yep, surprised, again.

15:36.960 --> 15:37.960
Ariston!

15:40.560 --> 15:41.840
Pretty friend.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.480
Mm. Huh!

15:44.160 --> 15:45.640
Livia also pretty.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.160
-Yay! We’re safe!
-Yeah! Yeah!

15:50.240 --> 15:53.120
-We’re safe!
-You risked a lot coming here.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.400
We're truly thankful. We all are.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.920
Uh, got a question.
How'd you know where to find us?

15:59.240 --> 16:01.600
-I didn't.
-Our combatabots did.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.840
-What?
-Mangle now connected to bots.

16:04.920 --> 16:09.600
You sent our coordinates to them? Wow!
Didn't know you could do that.

16:10.600 --> 16:14.200
Those... those venom-bot things,
they didn't even bother him.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.480
Yeah, that was news to me, too.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.280
Heard rumours Danuvia was working
on something like this.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.800
Their sting injects a virus,
so Centurions can shut down a bot.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.440
Fortunately, the virus appears
to be temporary.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.120
Mangle's not like other bots, is he?

16:30.200 --> 16:32.400
He's... special.

16:32.480 --> 16:35.240
Yeah. Guess, in some ways,
he's always been.

16:36.240 --> 16:40.360
And one day, with Mangle's help,
maybe all bots will be special.

16:40.840 --> 16:41.840
Even Compact.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.400
Compact already special.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.560
See, he make joke. Ha-ha!

16:48.640 --> 16:49.760
[all laugh]

16:50.240 --> 16:53.400
Very funny! Now, tell him to put me down.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.920
-Ha-ha!
-Mangle!

16:55.000 --> 16:56.440
[all laugh]

17:08.880 --> 17:11.760
-Robo-Robozuna!
-[cheering]

17:11.840 --> 17:14.480
This Robozuna Game is all tied up!

17:14.560 --> 17:17.920
The third and final round,
this is what it's all about!

17:18.000 --> 17:21.320
This is why the fans love Robozuna,

17:21.400 --> 17:24.560
outstanding teamwork
and friendly competition!

17:24.640 --> 17:27.160
Ha! There are no friends in Robozuna!

17:27.240 --> 17:29.960
It's all about
metal-crunching combatabots

17:30.040 --> 17:32.600
and their wham-pow,
take-you-down moves,

17:32.680 --> 17:36.360
which is why this three-on-three round
is rocking the arena!

17:36.440 --> 17:39.520
Team Capra's already taken down
Team Veredus's Clunk.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.320
Now it's three against two.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.040
[Slick] And this round's set
to be electrifying!

17:46.800 --> 17:48.360
Spark, run! Score!

17:49.920 --> 17:52.120
-[Mangle] Mangle block.
-Uh-huh, I'm looking good!

17:52.200 --> 17:54.840
Ready for a little whirl-hitzer?

17:55.360 --> 17:58.400
[grunts and groans]

18:02.320 --> 18:04.000
Go, Mangle! Score!

18:12.400 --> 18:13.800

18:23.600 --> 18:24.600
[electronic squeal]

18:29.400 --> 18:31.240
[crowd cheers]

18:31.320 --> 18:34.200
Pneumatic line crunched.
Get up, Mangle, get up!

18:35.080 --> 18:36.480
[grunts]

18:38.400 --> 18:39.440
[grunts]

18:40.760 --> 18:41.760
[Clubber] Got it!

18:43.920 --> 18:44.800
Got you!

18:47.560 --> 18:49.560
See why they call you Spark.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.800
[gibbers]

18:50.880 --> 18:51.800
[chuckles]

18:52.400 --> 18:55.000
Spark's gone! Circuits fried!

18:55.080 --> 18:58.600
Beautiful, Clubber.
Now, Rotor, let's score!

19:01.200 --> 19:02.920
No. Mangle score!

19:03.000 --> 19:04.960
And how's that going to happen?

19:06.120 --> 19:07.000
Ha!

19:07.560 --> 19:09.000
Battle-blocker fun!

19:09.080 --> 19:10.320
You fixed it!

19:10.400 --> 19:12.520
Thanks to the servos
your friend Tesh gave me.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.920
[electronic groan]

19:20.560 --> 19:22.440
[crowd cheers]

19:24.640 --> 19:26.480
[groans and grunts]

19:26.560 --> 19:27.600
[electronic squeak]

19:28.720 --> 19:29.560
[grunts]

19:30.360 --> 19:31.360
[squeals]

19:31.440 --> 19:34.160
Battle-blocker?
Why don't we have one of those?

19:36.680 --> 19:39.520
-Hm?
-Game over, Mangle!

19:39.600 --> 19:42.200
-Oh!
-[grunts]

19:45.440 --> 19:46.480
[grunting]

19:51.560 --> 19:52.400
[grunts]

[groans]

19:54.840 --> 19:57.360
[groans]

19:57.720 --> 19:58.680
[frustrated grunt]

20:03.800 --> 20:06.560
[Slick] Oh! What a shot! What a game!

20:06.640 --> 20:12.640
Mangle scores and Team Veredus
continues its Robozuna winning streak!

20:12.720 --> 20:15.360
Robo-Robozuna!

20:15.440 --> 20:16.920
Hey, that's my line.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.160
[crowd cheers]

20:25.600 --> 20:26.560
Civette.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.400
Livia. What?
You're here to gloat over your win?

20:30.880 --> 20:32.920
No, I came to give you something.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.120
Battle-blocker.

20:36.840 --> 20:40.000
Don't worry, we have a spare
and, uh, thought you could use one!

20:41.040 --> 20:42.240
Uh, I don't understand.

20:42.320 --> 20:46.440
Hey, we may be rivals in the arena,
but we can still be friends.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.480
And you never know when you may need one.

20:49.560 --> 20:53.600
Uh, thank you.
Heard there was quite a battle last night.

20:53.680 --> 20:57.120
Lightning Harvesters
saved by some kind of heroes.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.400
[chuckles] Heard that, too.

21:05.840 --> 21:08.640
Also heard those heroes took out
a Corvus Airship.

21:08.720 --> 21:11.360
The Centurions on the ground
couldn't report back.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.920
Couldn't identify their enemy.
Pretty clever whoever they are.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.440
You seem to hear a lot.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.720
Also heard you might be looking for
a security over-rider

21:22.800 --> 21:24.200
for the Corvus Prison.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.920
-Thanks, but we--
-You don't have to say anything.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.560
Just looking to be a friend.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.200
Never know when need friend.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.720
You're right, Mangle. You're right.
