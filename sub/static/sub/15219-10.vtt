Hey, you should take your

Don't say it

06:53.002 --> 06:57.200
Well, Ray,
he never really quite made it.

As a matter of fact,
the closest he ever got to stardom,

07:00.009 --> 07:03.206
was understudying
John O'Malley.

07:03.279 --> 07:07.613

he does a Gerald Ford impersonation

you can go out there and sing.

10:29.852 --> 10:35.256
how could you pass up
the chance to be a star?

14:18.547 --> 14:21.607
I kept track of you

Well, uh,
I'm back teaching piano...

14:40.135 --> 14:42.035
