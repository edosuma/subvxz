[ Laughs ]

16:20.435 --> 16:21.634
Yes!

16:21.636 --> 16:23.970
Arcee found us!

16:25.706 --> 16:28.241
[ Laughs evilly ]

16:28.243 --> 16:32.078
Put any doubt of my allegiance
to rest.

16:33.781 --> 16:35.715
What's <i>he</i> doing down here?

16:35.717 --> 16:38.651
Miko, get behind me... now!

16:43.524 --> 16:48.762
Well, well, if isn't Bulkhead
and his pet Vermin.

16:48.764 --> 16:54.134
My, you do have your hands full,
don't you, Autobot?

16:54.136 --> 16:56.703
Do whatever you want to me,
Starscream,

16:56.705 --> 16:58.138
but let the human go!

16:58.140 --> 16:59.339
No! [ Strains ]

16:59.341 --> 17:01.441
I'm not leaving you!

17:01.443 --> 17:06.311
It appears that the human
wishes to remain.

17:06.314 --> 17:09.449
Starscream, don't push me!

17:09.451 --> 17:12.551
You like playing
with the big robots,

17:12.554 --> 17:14.454
don't you, little girl?

17:14.455 --> 17:16.723
[ Panting ]

[ Straining ]

17:30.671 --> 17:33.640
[ Growling ]

17:33.642 --> 17:35.875
That's it, Autobot...
I will...

17:35.877 --> 17:37.577
What?

17:37.579 --> 17:38.878
You'll what?

17:38.880 --> 17:41.714
Make me bring down the ceiling
on top of all of us?

17:41.716 --> 17:43.082
Run, Miko!

17:46.320 --> 17:48.354
Yes. Run, Miko.

17:48.356 --> 17:51.324
I would love to see you try.

17:51.326 --> 17:54.394
Really, I would.

[ Thud ]

17:57.598 --> 17:59.365
Aah!

18:03.204 --> 18:06.639
Jack, get Miko
out of here... now!

18:06.641 --> 18:07.907
[ Grunts ]

18:12.012 --> 18:15.014
Come on! Come on!

18:15.016 --> 18:16.349
Run, Miko!

We can't leave Bulkhead!

18:26.761 --> 18:28.294
[ Moans ]

18:39.039 --> 18:42.609
And then there were two.

18:45.913 --> 18:48.081
Arcee will save him, won't she?

18:48.083 --> 18:51.050
You and I just need to find
a way out of here

18:51.052 --> 18:53.386
before Megatron
digs himself free.

18:53.388 --> 18:55.622
Megatron's here, too?!

[ Gasps ]

19:03.231 --> 19:05.064
[ Chuckling ]

19:05.066 --> 19:09.035
If you think I'm gonna beg
for mercy, Starscream,

19:09.037 --> 19:10.303
forget it.

19:10.305 --> 19:14.607
Yes, begging for mercy
would be quite pathetic,

19:14.609 --> 19:15.909
wouldn't it?

19:15.911 --> 19:19.345
Well, you're much more valuable
to me alive.

19:19.347 --> 19:21.915
Imagine Megatron's appreciation

19:21.917 --> 19:25.718
when I not only rescue him
but deliver an Autobot.

19:25.720 --> 19:30.924
I believe that would restore
my stature quite nicely.

19:30.926 --> 19:33.426
[ Weapon charges ]

19:35.963 --> 19:39.565
<i>Don't</i> move, Starscream.

Hey, Bulk.

Hey, 'cee.

Raise your hands.

[ Shuddering ]

19:47.609 --> 19:49.976
Aww.

20:03.824 --> 20:06.759
We could finish them
here and now.

20:06.761 --> 20:09.762
Shame we didn't bring
any grenades.

20:09.764 --> 20:12.932
Would Optimus...
finish them?

20:12.934 --> 20:16.169
No.
He probably wouldn't.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.704
Not like this.

20:17.706 --> 20:21.274
But Optimus wouldn't rescue
them, either, right?

20:21.276 --> 20:23.576
Let's go home.

20:28.916 --> 20:32.251

Thank the all spark!

I returned...
to save you!

Save me?

21:10.657 --> 21:14.027
Look into my spark,
lord Megatron.

21:14.029 --> 21:16.729
My intentions were true.
