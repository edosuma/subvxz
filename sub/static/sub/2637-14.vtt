WEBVTT

00:00.651 --> 00:03.011
This sandwich is an 
unmitigated disaster.

00:04.298 --> 00:06.170
I asked for turkey and roast beef

00:06.242 --> 00:07.713
with lettuce and swiss 
on whole wheat.

00:07.874 --> 00:08.770
What did they give you?

00:08.865 --> 00:09.801
Turkey and roast beef

00:09.881 --> 00:11.961
with swiss and lettuce 
on whole wheat.

00:18.064 --> 00:20.967
It's the right ingredients 
but in the wrong order.

00:21.896 --> 00:22.982
In a proper sandwich

00:23.017 --> 00:24.805
the cheese is adjacent to the bread

00:24.826 --> 00:26.973
to create a moisture barrier 
against the lettuce.

00:28.756 --> 00:30.780
They might as well drag
this thing into a car wash.

00:32.335 --> 00:33.619
I don't believe it.

00:33.722 --> 00:35.213
I know, it's basic culinary science.

00:36.250 --> 00:39.460
Some guy is actioning up a 
miniature time machine prop

00:39.479 --> 00:41.347
from the original film 
and nobody's bidding on it.

00:41.494 --> 00:43.905
A time machine from the 
movie "The time machine"?

00:44.498 --> 00:47.320
No, a time machine from "Sophie's choice".

00:47.937 --> 00:50.271
Boy, Sophie could have used 
a time machine in that movie

00:50.840 --> 00:51.882
Did you see it? It's rough.

00:54.144 --> 00:55.087
Oh that's cool.

00:55.579 --> 00:56.767
It's only 800 dollars?

00:56.771 --> 00:58.398
Yes, and that's my bid.

00:58.614 --> 00:59.894
You bid 800 dollars?

00:59.907 --> 01:01.526
Yes, it was a spur-of-the-moment thing

01:01.658 --> 01:03.062
I figured it would go for thousands

01:03.157 --> 01:04.660
and I just wanted to be a part of it.

01:05.437 --> 01:07.005
There's only 30 seconds 
left in the auction.

01:07.209 --> 01:08.423
Do you have 800 dollars?

01:08.519 --> 01:10.427
Not to blow on a 
miniature time machine.

01:10.895 --> 01:12.088
Oh don't worry, the way 
this thing works

01:12.145 --> 01:13.364
is people waiting till 
the last seconds to bid

01:13.373 --> 01:15.328
and then they swoop in and get it.
It's called sniping.

01:15.369 --> 01:16.344
15 seconds.

01:16.479 --> 01:17.783
Come on snipers.

01:19.803 --> 01:22.047
Ten, nine, eight...

01:22.054 --> 01:23.158
Where are your snipers?

01:24.306 --> 01:25.424
- Five
- Snipe!

01:25.465 --> 01:26.293
- Four
- Snipe!

01:26.681 --> 01:27.432
- Three
- Snipe!

01:27.497 --> 01:28.253
- Two
- Snipe!

01:28.717 --> 01:29.581
One...

01:30.899 --> 01:31.598
Congratulations!

01:32.055 --> 01:34.830
You are a proud owner of 
a miniature time machine.

01:36.140 --> 01:37.164
You lucky duck.

01:37.997 --> 01:39.465
I wonder why no one else bid

01:39.480 --> 01:42.193
This is a classic piece of 
sci-fi movie memorabilia.

01:42.276 --> 01:44.139
I know! I still can't afford it.

01:44.548 --> 01:45.515
Why don't we share it?

01:45.607 --> 01:46.986
Well each put 200 bucks and

01:47.065 --> 01:48.250
we'll take turns having it in our house.

01:48.526 --> 01:49.954
A time shared time machine.

01:52.184 --> 01:54.391
I'm in. Sheldon?
Need you ask?

01:55.457 --> 01:57.183
But I still don't understand 
why no one else bid.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.899 --> 02:08.572
I understand why no one else bid.

02:10.056 --> 02:13.128
Our whole universe was
in a hot,dense state

02:13.281 --> 02:16.824
then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... wait!

02:17.215 --> 02:18.160
The Earth began to cool 
The autotrophs began to drool,

02:18.324 --> 02:21.148
Neanderthals developed tools 
We built the wall

02:21.315 --> 02:23.134
We built the pyramids
Math, Science, History

02:23.238 --> 02:25.925
Unraveling the mystery 
That all started

02:26.053 --> 02:27.733
With a Big Bang! 
Bang!

02:27.734 --> 02:28.734
www.wikisubtitles.net

02:28.735 --> 02:29.735
The Big Bang Theory S01 E14
The Nerdmabelia Scattering

02:29.736 --> 02:30.736
The Big Bang Theory S01 E14
The Nerdmabelia Scattering

02:37.469 --> 02:39.837
Did the listing actually 
said "miniature"?

02:42.193 --> 02:43.390
I just assumed.

02:44.690 --> 02:47.828
Who sells a full size time 
machine for 800 dollars?

02:49.189 --> 02:52.188
In a Venn diagram that 
would be an individual located

02:52.192 --> 02:53.544
within the intersection of the sets:

02:53.624 --> 02:55.199
"No longer want my time machine"

02:55.279 --> 02:56.265
and "Need 800 dollars".

02:58.201 --> 03:00.186
It's actually a tremendous bargain.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.561
Even with shipping it works out

03:01.726 --> 03:03.217
to less than four dollars a pound.

03:04.816 --> 03:06.289
Cocktails shrimp at 12.50.

03:09.092 --> 03:10.488
How are we gonna get it upstairs?

03:12.409 --> 03:13.566
If we take the dish off

03:13.763 --> 03:14.818
it might fit in the elevator.

03:15.207 --> 03:17.565
Yes but the elevator has 
been broken for two years.

03:18.231 --> 03:19.133
I've been meaning to ask you

03:19.169 --> 03:20.969
Do you think we should 
make a call about that?

03:23.436 --> 03:24.357
Not necessarily.

03:24.423 --> 03:26.453
I have a masters in engineering.

03:26.555 --> 03:28.939
I remotely repair satellites 
on a regular basis.

03:29.602 --> 03:31.923
I troubleshoot space 
shuttle payloads.

03:33.086 --> 03:36.009
When the Mars Rover started 
pulling to the left, I performed

03:36.213 --> 03:40.073
a front end alignment from 
62 millions miles away.

03:50.362 --> 03:51.469
No, that baby's broken.

03:54.881 --> 03:56.005
Come on guys, push!

03:56.412 --> 03:57.901
If I push any harder

03:58.080 --> 03:59.636
I'm gonna give birth to my colon.

04:00.856 --> 04:02.684
I can't feel my fingers!
Hurry up!

04:03.028 --> 04:03.863
It's the same amount of work

04:03.927 --> 04:04.954
no matter how fast you go.

04:05.026 --> 04:06.190
Basic physics.

04:06.198 --> 04:07.274
- Sheldon?
- Yeah?

04:07.388 --> 04:09.074
If my fingers ever work again

04:09.361 --> 04:10.778
I've got a job for the middle one.

04:12.741 --> 04:13.464
Oh hey guys.

04:13.701 --> 04:14.433
Hi Penny.

04:17.964 --> 04:18.747
Take a break guys.

04:20.521 --> 04:21.341
What are you doing?

04:21.591 --> 04:23.647
We're just, you know, 
moving something upstairs.

04:24.135 --> 04:25.005
What is it?

04:25.289 --> 04:28.078
Just, you know, a time machine.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.941
Yeah, ok, neat, but I 
really gotta get to work, so...

04:31.398 --> 04:33.201
- Just give us a few minutes.
- I don't have a few minutes.

04:33.287 --> 04:34.196
I'm running really late.

04:34.467 --> 04:36.011
I have a sample solution.

04:36.107 --> 04:38.204
Go up to the roof, hop 
over the next building

04:38.346 --> 04:39.299
There's a small gap

04:39.319 --> 04:40.652
- don't look down if you suffer the vertigo - 

04:40.831 --> 04:42.018
and use their stairway.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.507
You're joking, right?

04:44.606 --> 04:46.337
I never joke when it comes to vertigo.

04:48.964 --> 04:51.280
Damn... Ok, I'll just take the roof.

04:51.944 --> 04:54.112
Hey, if you wait for us to 
set up the time machine

04:54.115 --> 04:55.736
I can drop you off to work yesterday.

04:58.260 --> 05:00.501
Time travel... jokes. 
Nevermind.

05:02.598 --> 05:04.373
For what it's worth, 
I thought it was humorous.

05:08.856 --> 05:09.948
Let's just do this.

05:10.609 --> 05:11.572
Guys, ready to push?

05:12.043 --> 05:12.946
In a minute.

05:13.163 --> 05:14.482
Howard stepped outside to throw up.

05:20.785 --> 05:22.337
I don't know what you're worried about.

05:22.421 --> 05:23.929
I think it really works in the room.

05:25.932 --> 05:26.615
Yeah.

05:26.704 --> 05:28.448
It is by far the coolest thing

05:28.519 --> 05:29.640
I've ever owned.

05:29.779 --> 05:32.575
The exact time machine that 
carried actor Rod Taylor

05:32.615 --> 05:33.654
from victorian England

05:33.919 --> 05:35.551
into the post-apocaliptic future

05:35.818 --> 05:37.942
where society had splintered 
into two factions:

05:38.325 --> 05:40.789
The subterranean Morlocks, 
who survived by feasting

05:40.877 --> 05:42.997
on the flesh of the gentle 
surface-dwelling Eloi.

05:45.763 --> 05:48.187
Talk about you chick magnet.

05:50.139 --> 05:51.298
Oh, yeah.

05:51.382 --> 05:53.170
The guy who lives next to me is always like

05:53.246 --> 05:54.897
"I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony"

05:54.913 --> 05:56.433
"I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony"

05:56.876 --> 05:57.961
Wait until I tell him

05:58.409 --> 06:00.177
"I've got a time machine on my balcony"

06:02.298 --> 06:04.142
Stuff that in your Speedoes,
Jacuzzi Bob."

06:05.719 --> 06:07.775
Gentlemen, I know we 
said we'd take turns

06:07.819 --> 06:08.727
but I think you'll agree

06:08.774 --> 06:11.286
that practicality dictates 
it remain here.

06:11.747 --> 06:12.897
You can't just keep it here

06:12.908 --> 06:14.177
What if I meet a girl and say

06:14.249 --> 06:15.693
"Do you wanna come up 
and see my time machine?

06:15.804 --> 06:16.923
It's at my friend's house"

06:16.968 --> 06:18.139
How lame is that?

06:18.980 --> 06:20.727
- He's got a point.
- All right.

06:20.752 --> 06:22.819
I think we're going to need 
some ground rules, in addiction

06:22.875 --> 06:24.923
to the expected 
"No shoes in the time machine"

06:25.035 --> 06:26.281
and "No eating in the time machine"

06:26.363 --> 06:28.621
I propose that we add 
"Pants must be worn

06:28.661 --> 06:30.169
at all times in the time machine"

06:31.372 --> 06:32.432
Second it.

06:33.660 --> 06:34.952
I was gonna put down a towel.

06:39.196 --> 06:40.526
I still want it on my balcony.

06:40.802 --> 06:42.918
I say we move it on a bimonthly basis.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.457
- Yeah, that sounds fair
- Hold on.

06:44.521 --> 06:46.352
"bimonthly" is an ambiguous term.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.319
Do you mean moving it every 
other month or twice a month?

06:48.512 --> 06:49.583
- Twice a month.
- Then no.

06:50.186 --> 06:51.315
Ok, every other month.

06:51.320 --> 06:52.026
No.

06:53.702 --> 06:55.306
Sheldon, you can't be selfish.

06:55.401 --> 06:57.169
We all paid for it so it belongs to all of us.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.794
Now get out of the way so 
I can sit on my time machine.

07:09.328 --> 07:14.038
Ok. I'm setting the dials 
for 10th March 1876.

07:14.647 --> 07:16.198
Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell

07:16.221 --> 07:18.271
invents the telephone and 
calls out for Dr. Watson.

07:18.537 --> 07:20.382
Wait a minute, I want to see that too.

07:20.518 --> 07:21.934
So when it's your turn you can.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.696
But if you all go back to 
the same point and time

07:23.879 --> 07:25.397
Bell's lab is going to get very crowded.

07:25.678 --> 07:26.813
He'll know something's up.

07:28.133 --> 07:29.877
Also, since the time machine 
doesn't move in space

07:30.165 --> 07:32.381
you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.

07:32.460 --> 07:34.315
And even if you can make it
to Boston, what are you gonna do?

07:34.372 --> 07:35.741
Knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell

07:35.472 --> 07:37.155
Hey, Mrs Bell, I'm a big 
fan of your husband

07:37.316 --> 07:38.682
Can I come in and watch him 
inventing the telephone?

07:40.080 --> 07:40.885
Mrs Bell was deaf

07:40.926 --> 07:42.169
She's not even going to hear you knock.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.360
I have a solution.

07:45.473 --> 07:48.272
First, go into the future 
and obtain a cloaking device.

07:48.788 --> 07:49.680
How far into the future?

07:49.789 --> 07:50.792
If I remember correctly

07:50.835 --> 07:52.534
Captain Kirk would steal a cloaking device

07:52.638 --> 07:55.304
from the Romulans on Star Date 5027.3

07:55.714 --> 07:58.921
Which would be 10th January 2328 
by pre-federation reckoning.

08:00.828 --> 08:05.207
Ok, I'm setting the dials 
for 10th January 2328.

08:05.847 --> 08:08.407
Here we go into the future.

08:29.949 --> 08:30.797
That was fun.

08:32.552 --> 08:33.364
My turn!

08:34.775 --> 08:36.385
Ok, first of all

08:36.476 --> 08:38.977
what you call a gap was 
nearly three feet wide

08:39.006 --> 08:40.842
- I slipped and skinned my knee.
- Are you ok?

08:42.308 --> 08:43.871
Second of all, the door to the stairway

08:43.937 --> 08:45.000
of the other building was locked.

08:45.014 --> 08:46.537
so I had to go down the fire escape

08:46.551 --> 08:47.691
which ends on the third floor

08:47.725 --> 08:49.321
forcing me to crawl to the window

08:49.343 --> 08:50.832
of a lovely Armenian family

08:50.971 --> 08:52.391
who insisted I'd stay for lunch.

08:53.998 --> 08:55.247
That doesn't sound too bad.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.766
It was eight courses of lamb.

08:56.875 --> 08:58.790
And they tried to fix me up with their son.

09:01.281 --> 09:02.218
- Sorry.
- Not done.

09:02.668 --> 09:03.602
By the time I finally

09:03.604 --> 09:05.263
got to work they'd given my shift away.

09:05.305 --> 09:06.288
Yeah, that's right

09:06.421 --> 09:08.783
I've lost an entire day's pay thanks to this.

09:08.904 --> 09:10.528
- this...
- time machine

09:14.198 --> 09:15.912
The lights flash, the dish spins, 
do you wanna try it?

09:15.997 --> 09:17.040
No!!

09:18.145 --> 09:19.381
I don't wanna try it

09:19.463 --> 09:21.261
My God, you are grown men.

09:21.869 --> 09:23.628
How can you waste your lives with these

09:23.681 --> 09:25.512
stupid toys, and costumes

09:25.564 --> 09:27.563
and comic books and...
and now that!

09:27.981 --> 09:30.171
- That...
- Again, time machine.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.290
Oh please, it's not
time machine

09:34.318 --> 09:35.177
If anything it looks like something

09:35.249 --> 09:37.279
Elton John would drive 
through the Everglades.

09:43.772 --> 09:45.551
It only moves in time.

09:46.050 --> 09:48.335
It would be worse than useless in a swamp.

09:53.972 --> 09:55.764
Pathethic! all of you!

09:55.888 --> 09:57.398
Completely pathethic

10:02.951 --> 10:03.739
My turn

10:20.678 --> 10:22.378
Leonard, it's 2:00 in the morning

10:23.803 --> 10:24.714
So?

10:24.869 --> 10:25.945
So it's my turn.

10:29.508 --> 10:31.290
Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?

10:32.310 --> 10:34.020
Because I wanna go back and keep myself from

10:34.109 --> 10:35.453
getting a time machine.

10:36.097 --> 10:39.429
You can't. If you would prevent 
yourself from buying it in the past

10:39.599 --> 10:40.996
you wouldn't have it available in the present 

10:41.050 --> 10:42.387
to travel back and stop yourself

10:42.427 --> 10:44.011
from buying it. Ergo, you'd still have it.

10:44.347 --> 10:46.050
This is a classic working 
time-travel mistake.

10:49.856 --> 10:52.424
Can I go back and prevent you 
from explaining that to me?

10:53.836 --> 10:54.569
Same paradox

10:54.941 --> 10:56.440
If you were to travel back in time

10:56.605 --> 10:57.759
and, say, knock me unconscious

10:58.079 --> 10:59.330
you would not then have the conversation

10:59.368 --> 11:00.752
that irritated you

11:00.831 --> 11:02.206
motivating you to knock me unconscious.

11:04.262 --> 11:05.877
What if I knock you unconscious right now?

11:08.165 --> 11:09.086
It won't change the past.

11:11.631 --> 11:13.117
But it'd make the present 
so much nicer.

11:15.260 --> 11:16.732
Are you upset about something?

11:17.683 --> 11:19.122
What was your first clue?

11:20.374 --> 11:21.898
Well, that was a number of things.

11:22.206 --> 11:23.378
First, the late hour.

11:23.518 --> 11:25.761
Then your demeanor seems 
very low energy

11:25.848 --> 11:27.053
- Plus your irritability...
- Yes, I'm upset!

11:28.705 --> 11:30.196
I don't usually pick up on those things.

11:31.636 --> 11:32.408
Good for me.

11:35.903 --> 11:36.814
Yes, good for you.

11:38.163 --> 11:38.798
Oh, wait.

11:41.116 --> 11:43.109
Did you wanna talk about 
what's bothering you?

11:44.765 --> 11:45.796
I don't know, maybe.

11:46.412 --> 11:47.668
Wow, I'm on fire tonight.

11:52.827 --> 11:53.826
Here's the thing.

11:54.710 --> 11:58.586
Girls like Penny never end up 
with guys who own time machines.

11:59.229 --> 12:00.018
I disagree.

12:00.625 --> 12:03.280
Your inability to successfully woo Penny

12:03.321 --> 12:05.192
long predates your acquisition 
of the time machine.

12:07.979 --> 12:10.008
That failure clearly stands on itself.

12:12.031 --> 12:13.182
Thanks for pointing it out.

12:13.491 --> 12:15.238
In addiction, your premise is flaw.

12:15.282 --> 12:18.197
In the original film Rod Taylor 
got Yvette Mimieux

12:18.229 --> 12:19.445
in that very time machine.

12:19.845 --> 12:22.436
in "Back to the future" Marty McFly
 got the opportunity

12:22.493 --> 12:24.500
to hook up with his extremely 
attractive young mother.

12:28.012 --> 12:28.851
Those are movies.

12:29.172 --> 12:30.275
Of course they are movies.

12:30.895 --> 12:32.658
Were you expecting me to 
come up with an example

12:32.675 --> 12:34.459
involving a real-life time machine?

12:37.266 --> 12:38.121
It's absurd.

12:40.705 --> 12:41.767
Come on, guys, push!

12:42.328 --> 12:43.664
If I push any harder

12:43.752 --> 12:45.345
I'm gonna give birth to my colon.

12:47.806 --> 12:48.623
Hi guys.

12:48.766 --> 12:49.606
Hi Penny.

12:52.761 --> 12:53.625
Take a break guys!

12:55.395 --> 12:56.312
What are you doing?

12:56.464 --> 12:59.244
Oh, you know... just moving 
a... time machine.

13:01.124 --> 13:03.266
Yeah, ok, neat, but I really 
gotta get to work, so...

13:03.543 --> 13:04.340
No problem

13:11.296 --> 13:12.009
Hang on.

13:13.812 --> 13:15.313
But, what about your
time machine?

13:15.919 --> 13:17.497
Something more important
than the toys

13:27.146 --> 13:28.110
I'm scared

13:28.829 --> 13:30.300
Don't worry baby.
I've got you.

13:52.591 --> 13:53.566
It's still my turn.

13:59.941 --> 14:00.734
What are you doing?

14:02.722 --> 14:03.822
I'm packing up all my collectibles

14:03.832 --> 14:06.136
and taking them down at the 
comic books store to sell.

14:07.192 --> 14:08.307
Was that really necessary?

14:09.096 --> 14:10.820
If you need money you can 
always sell blood.

14:13.303 --> 14:14.105
and semen.

14:16.338 --> 14:17.090
Not about money

14:18.222 --> 14:18.961
We brought food!

14:19.333 --> 14:21.731
Lox and bagels, the breakfast 
for time travellers.

14:23.183 --> 14:23.484
Terrific

14:23.555 --> 14:25.424
Does anyone want to buy my 
share of the time machine?

14:25.488 --> 14:25.946
Why?

14:26.135 --> 14:27.352
I don't want it anymore.

14:27.780 --> 14:28.390
Why?

14:28.530 --> 14:29.934
just...personal reason

14:30.365 --> 14:33.369
My spidy sense tells me this 
has something to do with Penny.

14:33.961 --> 14:34.713
Look,

14:34.905 --> 14:36.675
- Do you want to buy me out or not?
- I'll give you

14:36.760 --> 14:38.776
100 dollars, which will 
make me half owner

14:38.855 --> 14:40.111
and we'll put it on my balcony.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.144
Screw his balcony

14:41.231 --> 14:42.886
I'll give you 120 and we'll put it in my garage.

14:43.267 --> 14:45.078
I paid 200 dollars for my share.

14:45.203 --> 14:46.223
Dude, everybody knows

14:46.300 --> 14:47.644
a time machine loses half his value

14:47.723 --> 14:48.947
the minute you drive him off the lot.

14:50.621 --> 14:53.152
I go for 200 and that time 
machine stands right where it is.

14:53.289 --> 14:57.180
300, and I'll throw in my 
original 1979 Mattel Millennium Falcon

14:57.179 --> 14:58.315
with real light speed 
sound effects.

14:59.321 --> 15:02.420
No, no more toys or action figures

15:02.501 --> 15:05.871
or props or replicas 
or costumes or robots

15:06.115 --> 15:07.516
or Darth Vader's voice changers.

15:07.611 --> 15:08.747
I'm getting rid of all of it

15:09.402 --> 15:10.372
You can't do that.

15:10.462 --> 15:11.707
Look at what you've created here.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.107
It's like "Nerdvana".

15:16.960 --> 15:17.645
More importantly,

15:18.368 --> 15:20.004
you have a Darth Vader's 
voice changer?

15:21.706 --> 15:22.435
Not for long.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.922
Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.

15:25.015 --> 15:25.797
Hang on, I need that

15:25.864 --> 15:27.833
to complete my Justice Society 
of America collection.

15:27.929 --> 15:28.531
Too bad, I called dibs.

15:28.635 --> 15:30.187
- You can't just call dibs.
- I can and I did

15:30.213 --> 15:31.101
Look at "dibs" on the Wikipedia.

15:33.181 --> 15:34.963
Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.

15:35.140 --> 15:36.339
It's not a bidding war.

15:36.932 --> 15:38.987
I'm selling it all to Larry 
down at the comic books store.

15:39.251 --> 15:40.484
Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?

15:40.582 --> 15:41.419
Would you forget dibs?

15:42.343 --> 15:44.426
He offered me a fair price 
for the whole collection.

15:44.861 --> 15:45.778
What's the number? I'll match it.

15:46.197 --> 15:48.082
I'll match it plus 1000 rupies

15:49.249 --> 15:50.961
- What's the exchange rate?
- None of your business.

15:51.069 --> 15:51.961
Take it or leave it.

15:52.943 --> 15:54.068
Mom, my Bar Mitzvah bond

15:54.116 --> 15:55.120
how much have I got?

15:55.785 --> 15:56.194
Thanks.

15:56.512 --> 15:58.774
I can go 2.600 dollars 
and two trees in Israel.

16:01.465 --> 16:02.349
Forget it.

16:02.426 --> 16:03.590
If I sell it to one of you

16:03.621 --> 16:05.149
the other two are gonna 
be really mad at me.

16:05.476 --> 16:06.080
Who cares?

16:06.145 --> 16:07.236
As long as you pick me!

16:08.861 --> 16:10.068
Okay Leonard, put down that box.

16:10.116 --> 16:11.365
- Let's talk.
- Sorry Raj.

16:11.406 --> 16:12.594
My mind is made up

16:12.895 --> 16:13.963
No

16:14.289 --> 16:15.330
I can't let you do this

16:16.802 --> 16:18.232
Sheldon, get out of my way

16:22.049 --> 16:23.584
None shall pass

16:27.871 --> 16:28.342
Okay

16:29.574 --> 16:31.030
I did not want to do this

16:31.293 --> 16:34.404
but I have here the rare, 
mint condition, production error

16:34.493 --> 16:36.700
Star Trek: The Next Generation 
Geordi La Forge

16:36.780 --> 16:39.196
without his visor in 
the original packaging.

16:40.152 --> 16:41.372
If you do not get out of my way

16:42.630 --> 16:43.474
I will open it.

16:45.457 --> 16:46.322
Okay man,
be cool

16:48.029 --> 16:48.889
We're all friends here

16:50.977 --> 16:52.137
What the hell is going on?

16:52.688 --> 16:54.352
You Hypocrit!

16:54.665 --> 16:55.639
What?

16:55.677 --> 16:57.896
Little miss "Grown-ups-
don't-play-with-toys".

16:58.165 --> 16:59.791
If I went into that 
apartment right now

16:59.864 --> 17:01.518
would I not find beany babies?

17:01.743 --> 17:02.886
are you not an accumulator

17:03.000 --> 17:04.662
of Care Bears and 
My Little Ponies?

17:04.952 --> 17:08.006
And who is that japanese feline 
I see frawn looking at your shorts?

17:08.271 --> 17:09.383
Hello, hello Kitty!

17:13.442 --> 17:14.279
Okay.

17:14.346 --> 17:16.740
Okay,look this is about yesterday,
Leonard.

17:16.796 --> 17:18.771
I'm really sorry about what i said

17:18.832 --> 17:20.499
- I was jus upset
- No, i needed to heard it

17:20.588 --> 17:22.627
No, you didn't 
Look you're great guy

17:22.800 --> 17:25.582
it's the things you love
that make who you are

17:26.310 --> 17:28.252
I guess that makes me
"Large breasts"

17:33.213 --> 17:35.984
Still I think it's time for me
to get rid of this stuff

17:36.157 --> 17:38.376
and, you know
move on with my life.

17:38.920 --> 17:39.479
Really?

17:40.139 --> 17:40.786
Oh

17:41.751 --> 17:44.047
Wow, good for you

17:45.508 --> 17:46.232
Thanks

17:48.846 --> 17:49.958
Hey, do you want...

17:50.271 --> 17:51.264
I don't know, later...

17:51.295 --> 17:52.159
Excuse me..

17:53.051 --> 17:54.503
Hi Penny
Hi Mike

17:54.584 --> 17:56.375
You're ready to go?
yeah, i just have to change

17:56.470 --> 17:57.485
I give you a hand

17:57.766 --> 17:58.598
Stop it!

17:59.345 --> 18:00.102
Bye guys

18:05.675 --> 18:06.700
My turn on the time machine!

18:30.227 --> 18:31.125
It worked

18:32.997 --> 18:33.955
It really worked

18:35.524 --> 18:38.523
They said i was mad,
but it worked!

18:45.437 --> 18:46.608
Oh no!

18:46.910 --> 18:48.145
Not Morlocks!

18:48.609 --> 18:50.816
Not flash-eating Morlocks!

18:51.260 --> 18:54.319
Help!

19:02.665 --> 19:03.492
Sheldon, you okay?

19:04.492 --> 19:05.877
We have to get rid 
of the time machine.

19:07.010 --> 19:09.004
It's too little big for
the living room, isn't it?

19:10.164 --> 19:11.540
yeah, that's the problem.
It's too big.

19:13.350 --> 19:14.265
I'm glad you agreed

19:14.480 --> 19:16.032
I hired some guys 
to help us move it.

19:16.052 --> 19:17.032
Come on in fellas

19:20.607 --> 19:22.895
Oh no, Morlocks!

19:23.146 --> 19:24.472
Eat him,
eat Him.

19:30.068 --> 19:32.285
Leonard!
