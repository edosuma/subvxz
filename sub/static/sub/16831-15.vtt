WEBVTT

00:01.631 --> 00:02.834
Jake Neville, NSA.

00:02.869 --> 00:04.694
This project's command was taken over

00:04.719 --> 00:06.320
by the National Security Agency.

00:06.354 --> 00:08.757
The agents in control
of Mason Industries...

00:08.782 --> 00:09.850
they're Rittenhouse.

00:09.875 --> 00:11.464
She is there right now.

00:11.488 --> 00:12.889
This is Rittenhouse we're talking about.

00:12.923 --> 00:14.490
- They could kill her.
- Monsieur Charvet?

00:14.525 --> 00:16.893
- Oui.
- I have so many questions.

00:16.927 --> 00:18.728
Scary Rittenhouse dude is your father?

00:18.762 --> 00:21.631
The guy who's been terrorizing
me, that's your dad?

00:21.665 --> 00:23.566
I will never be a part
of this. Do you hear me?

00:23.600 --> 00:25.835
Rittenhouse isn't a
choice. It's your legacy.

00:25.869 --> 00:27.637
I'm just a secretary.

00:27.671 --> 00:29.839
Ah, don't sell yourself short.

00:29.873 --> 00:32.075
I saw that drawing on your
desk. You are very gifted.

00:32.109 --> 00:34.610
I bet one day you'll do some
remarkable things at Lockman.

00:34.645 --> 00:36.913
Maria Thompkins was Flynn's mother.

00:36.947 --> 00:38.314
Hey.

00:38.349 --> 00:39.983
What are we gonna do about Rittenhouse?

00:40.017 --> 00:41.469
We fight.

00:42.453 --> 00:43.953
How?

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

00:54.498 --> 00:57.862
You've been warming this
bench for the past two hours.

00:58.302 --> 01:01.037
Look. I was about to step out
for my fantasy football draft,

01:01.071 --> 01:04.173
but I can't leave you
here looking like this.

01:04.208 --> 01:06.043
House rules.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.535
So, a penny for your thoughts?

01:08.560 --> 01:11.095
Might make you a millionaire, Father.

01:11.382 --> 01:14.247
The rectory could use an upgrade.

01:15.753 --> 01:17.954
My wife was the practicing Catholic.

01:17.988 --> 01:22.058
She'd drag me to mass once
a month like clockwork.

01:22.092 --> 01:24.293
I never really took it seriously myself.

01:24.328 --> 01:27.096
Neither did I, for the longest time.

01:28.619 --> 01:30.612
I have a job.

01:31.068 --> 01:33.569
In the beginning, I
thought it was important,

01:33.604 --> 01:36.506
that it could help a lot of people,

01:36.540 --> 01:39.008
hopefully even bring my wife back to me.

01:39.043 --> 01:42.645
But not matter what I
do, nothing gets better.

01:42.679 --> 01:45.642
If anything, it only gets worse.

01:46.083 --> 01:48.384
I get it. But when times are tough,

01:48.419 --> 01:50.553
you just got to trust
that God has a plan.

01:50.587 --> 01:52.822
What if you could change that plan?

01:52.856 --> 01:54.876
I don't follow.

01:55.692 --> 01:58.428
What if you could...

01:58.462 --> 02:01.497
make a person go left instead of right,

02:01.532 --> 02:03.166
backward instead of forward?

02:03.200 --> 02:07.349
What if you had the power to
change the course of history?

02:08.771 --> 02:10.598
Does that mean...

02:10.624 --> 02:14.013
nothing's meant to be?

02:14.273 --> 02:16.607
Does that mean God's not there?

02:16.632 --> 02:17.965
Would he stop me?

02:17.990 --> 02:19.949
What are you asking?

02:24.988 --> 02:27.590
I'm asking for absolution.

02:37.101 --> 02:39.885
Guess this is what North Korea's like.

02:45.509 --> 02:48.244
Listen. Whatever happens,
just do what they say.

02:48.278 --> 02:50.426
Everything's gonna be fine.

02:52.769 --> 02:54.139
Flynn made another jump?

02:54.164 --> 02:57.386
So glad you could finally
join us, Ms. Preston.

02:57.421 --> 02:58.588
Mr. Carlin.

02:58.622 --> 03:00.995
I, for one, am sick of waiting

03:01.020 --> 03:03.782
for Garcia Flynn to dictate our actions.

03:03.807 --> 03:05.493
No more playing defense.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.063
We're gonna take the son of a bitch out

03:07.097 --> 03:08.097
once and for all.

03:08.132 --> 03:09.605
How?

03:10.644 --> 03:13.130
1962. Houston, Texas.

03:13.155 --> 03:15.671
1962. That's the year
before the JFK assassination.

03:15.706 --> 03:16.755
But why Houston?

03:16.780 --> 03:18.941
Do you remember Maria Thompkins?

03:18.976 --> 03:21.622
Wyatt Logan met her
during your NASA mission.

03:21.647 --> 03:23.579
Yeah. Garcia Flynn's mother. Yes.

03:23.614 --> 03:25.014
But what does she have to do with it?

03:25.048 --> 03:28.084
In 1962, Thompkins was
a 17-year-old junior

03:28.118 --> 03:30.143
at Sam Houston High School.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.821
The mission is to eliminate her.

03:31.855 --> 03:33.356
- Whoa.
- You can't be serious.

03:33.390 --> 03:34.857
No, no, no. There is no
way that we are doing that.

03:34.892 --> 03:36.025
She's... she's innocent.

03:36.059 --> 03:37.827
We don't expect either of you

03:37.861 --> 03:40.029
to pull the trigger.

03:40.063 --> 03:42.258
Meet your new tactical commander,

03:42.283 --> 03:44.300
Sergeant Major Caleb Sullivan.

03:44.334 --> 03:46.202
You just lead him to the front door,

03:46.236 --> 03:47.803
and he'll take care of the rest.

03:47.838 --> 03:49.263
- Ma'am.
- Don't "ma'am" me.

03:49.288 --> 03:51.497
Okay, so, you just
want us to play wingman

03:51.522 --> 03:52.942
to the Terminator over there?

03:52.976 --> 03:54.877
And you? You're fine with this?

03:54.912 --> 03:57.113
You're just gonna stand
there and let this happen?

03:57.147 --> 03:58.347
Flynn's mother may be innocent,

03:58.382 --> 04:00.149
but she still raised a monster.

04:00.184 --> 04:01.450
And given your performances,

04:01.485 --> 04:03.239
this may be the only
way to get this done.

04:03.264 --> 04:05.321
Forget it. We refuse.

04:05.355 --> 04:08.090
You cannot make us do
this. This is not right.

04:08.270 --> 04:11.127
Maybe I haven't been clear.

04:11.161 --> 04:15.031
This operation has been
green-lit at the highest levels.

04:15.065 --> 04:16.285
It's a go.

04:16.310 --> 04:18.343
You refuse, we will charge you

04:18.378 --> 04:21.613
with aiding and abetting
a wanted terrorist.

04:21.939 --> 04:25.875
So, you can either spend the
next few hours working for me,

04:25.909 --> 04:29.704
or the next 10 to 15
years wishing you had.

04:32.549 --> 04:34.591
That clear enough for you?

04:47.531 --> 04:49.498
I'm sorry. Agent
Neville's bedside manner

04:49.533 --> 04:51.267
leaves something to be desired.

04:51.301 --> 04:53.069
I guess I shouldn't be
surprised that you're here.

04:53.103 --> 04:55.404
You have to understand
Flynn is out of control.

04:55.439 --> 04:57.540
If this one death can save hundreds...

04:57.574 --> 04:59.691
Save Rittenhouse, you mean.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.987
This is the murder of
an innocent girl, period.

05:02.012 --> 05:04.947
He cares nothing about
history or collateral damage.

05:04.981 --> 05:07.191
And what's his mother? What is she?

05:07.851 --> 05:09.385
We need you on this trip.

05:09.419 --> 05:11.487
You're our chosen historian.
You always have been.

05:11.521 --> 05:13.489
- Go to hell.
- Lucy!

05:13.523 --> 05:16.125
I know we're asking the unthinkable.

05:16.159 --> 05:17.493
This isn't who you are.

05:17.527 --> 05:19.828
You have such a good
heart, and I admire that.

05:19.863 --> 05:22.769
I'm... I'm proud of you.

05:22.794 --> 05:26.385
I only ask that you do this one mission.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.635
The next one...

05:28.660 --> 05:31.018
will be saving your sister.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.541
I fully intend to honor the deal

05:32.576 --> 05:33.976
you've made with Agent Christopher,

05:34.010 --> 05:35.477
and I'm in a much better
position to do that

05:35.512 --> 05:37.280
than she could ever be.

05:38.081 --> 05:40.416
That's what you want, isn't it?

05:40.450 --> 05:42.351
More than anything?

05:53.063 --> 05:55.576
- Hey, could you...
- Hey, what?

05:56.132 --> 05:57.545
Never mind.

05:58.301 --> 06:00.536
Just so you know, you could
get a little queasy on reentry.

06:00.570 --> 06:03.646
Don't worry about me. I'm
not your dance partner.

06:27.330 --> 06:29.297
Are we here?

06:37.641 --> 06:39.823
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

06:40.580 --> 06:42.436
- Ohh.
- Holy sh...

06:42.479 --> 06:43.912
You did it! Okay.

06:43.947 --> 06:45.338
Um...

06:48.752 --> 06:50.386
I just have to reconfigure
the coordinates.

06:50.420 --> 06:52.227
Do you think Mason is
gonna be able to track us?

06:52.252 --> 06:54.323
Not after what I did to his computers.

06:57.970 --> 06:59.995
Wait a minute. I've lost them.

07:00.030 --> 07:01.313
What do you mean, you've lost them?

07:01.338 --> 07:03.432
They've jumped. They're no longer in...

07:03.457 --> 07:04.878
_

07:09.082 --> 07:10.939
- Nothing's responding.
- Get them up.

07:10.974 --> 07:12.274
Where in the hell are they?

07:12.309 --> 07:14.176
The system's crashing. Damn!

07:14.210 --> 07:16.879
_

07:20.517 --> 07:22.017
Rufus.

07:23.453 --> 07:25.990
- I can try to run a diagnostic.
- Step away from the controls, Jiya.

07:26.015 --> 07:27.051
Now!

07:27.076 --> 07:28.824
Did you know he was
going to do this? Did you?

07:28.858 --> 07:30.492
- No! I swear.
- Will somebody tell me

07:30.527 --> 07:31.767
what the hell is going on?

07:31.792 --> 07:33.162
This is Rufus's doing.

07:33.196 --> 07:34.697
It's a computer worm.
We're dead in the water.

07:34.731 --> 07:36.432
We can't track the Lifeboat.

07:36.466 --> 07:38.434
And Jiya's not to be trusted.
She's sleeping with him.

07:38.468 --> 07:40.455
- Mason!
- Rufus thinks he's smarter than me.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.863
All right, well, I'll
handle this myself.

07:41.888 --> 07:43.527
You get the hell out!

07:49.066 --> 07:52.627
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

08:01.867 --> 08:04.125
It's us! We're okay!

08:04.937 --> 08:06.504
We made it!

08:06.538 --> 08:08.789
You did it! You held
the gun like I said, huh?

08:08.814 --> 08:10.007
Yeah, pulled the
trigger between breaths.

08:10.042 --> 08:11.576
Rufus, you're a badass.

08:11.610 --> 08:13.678
If by "badass," you mean
scared out of my mind.

08:13.712 --> 08:16.113
Okay. So, we just stole

08:16.148 --> 08:18.049
a giant piece of top-secret machinery

08:18.083 --> 08:19.884
and made ourselves fugitives
from the US government.

08:19.918 --> 08:22.253
- All good.
- You did the right thing.

08:22.278 --> 08:23.567
If Rittenhouse is running the shop,

08:23.601 --> 08:24.772
they can't have the time machine.

08:24.797 --> 08:26.428
Your sense of calm is super annoying.

08:26.453 --> 08:29.026
Rufus, they can't track
us? You shut them down?

08:29.061 --> 08:30.571
Yeah, but it's only a matter of hours

08:30.587 --> 08:32.188
before Mason is able
to counteract the worm

08:32.222 --> 08:33.556
and get the network back online.

08:33.590 --> 08:35.224
How much time does that give us?

08:35.259 --> 08:37.326
The Lifeboat's battery is
drained after two jumps.

08:37.361 --> 08:39.529
It'll need four hours to
recharge, if it even can, and...

08:39.563 --> 08:42.698
Okay. Okay. It's all right.

08:42.732 --> 08:44.490
One step at a time.

08:44.935 --> 08:46.459
First step:

08:47.326 --> 08:49.376
let's go get your sister back.

08:53.377 --> 08:54.712
What?

08:54.845 --> 08:56.412
I think that's reckless.

08:56.446 --> 08:57.580
Flynn is still out there...

08:57.614 --> 08:59.148
With all due respect, ma'am,

08:59.182 --> 09:02.326
we don't work for the
government anymore.

09:03.453 --> 09:05.521
I think Lucy deserves a shot.

09:06.683 --> 09:08.552
I'll start the charge.

09:11.917 --> 09:13.290
Thank you.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.088
Okay.

09:16.233 --> 09:17.600
Thank you.

09:19.469 --> 09:20.503
So, what's the plan?

09:20.537 --> 09:22.405
Okay, so, um,

09:22.439 --> 09:24.517
we go to 1979, UC Berkeley,

09:24.542 --> 09:27.209
and we make sure that my
mom and Henry Wallace meet.

09:28.340 --> 09:30.046
They always said that it
was love at first sight.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.048
They knew the minute that they
laid their eyes on each other.

09:32.082 --> 09:34.584
Well, let's go play cupid.

09:38.822 --> 09:40.271
It's Flynn.

09:40.824 --> 09:42.895
He's jumped.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.297
Where?

10:15.692 --> 10:18.594
Frankie says you have something
of vital interest to me.

10:19.863 --> 10:21.831
These tax ledgers were seized

10:21.865 --> 10:23.666
during the raid on one
of your establishments

10:23.700 --> 10:25.258
a few years ago.

10:25.802 --> 10:28.938
Key evidence for the tax evasion case

10:28.972 --> 10:30.881
they're building against you.

10:40.350 --> 10:41.817
Where'd you get these?

10:41.852 --> 10:44.123
Post office, believe it or not.

10:44.321 --> 10:46.286
Treasury Department keeps a...

10:46.311 --> 10:49.850
poorly guarded file
room there, Mr. Capone.

10:56.386 --> 10:58.432
That's your big gift?

11:00.137 --> 11:02.471
As if they're gonna
get me for tax evasion.

11:02.506 --> 11:03.706
Get him out of here.

11:03.740 --> 11:05.474
I also have this letter

11:05.509 --> 11:08.222
from your accountant, Mr. Mattingly.

11:10.914 --> 11:14.550
He makes some fairly
scandalous accusations.

11:19.322 --> 11:21.857
With this evidence, believe me,

11:21.892 --> 11:23.893
you'd be going to prison.

11:27.097 --> 11:29.065
Pay Mr. Mattingly a visit.

11:29.099 --> 11:31.600
Make sure he can't
write any more letters.

11:35.933 --> 11:38.106
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.

11:39.794 --> 11:41.394
What the hell are we supposed to do?

11:41.429 --> 11:43.863
It's one problem at a time.

11:43.898 --> 11:46.933
And right now that is Flynn
taking the Mothership to 1931.

11:46.968 --> 11:49.569
Except now Rittenhouse has
taken over Mason Industries,

11:49.604 --> 11:52.551
and they might be ten
times worse than Flynn.

11:54.434 --> 11:55.809
Maybe we're fighting the wrong battle.

11:55.843 --> 11:57.243
You're the one who
said we can't let Flynn

11:57.278 --> 11:59.379
take a wrecking ball to
everyone and everything.

11:59.413 --> 12:02.557
That was before we stole a
time machine, became fugitives,

12:02.582 --> 12:05.419
and Jiya was forced to work next
to a bunch of homicidal dicks!

12:05.444 --> 12:07.887
Rufus, like it or not,
we're the only ones

12:07.922 --> 12:09.389
who can stop Flynn from hurting people.

12:09.423 --> 12:12.364
And what about my sister, huh?

12:13.044 --> 12:15.228
I mean, this was my last
shot. If we don't do this now,

12:15.262 --> 12:17.130
I may never see my sister again.

12:17.164 --> 12:19.499
They track us down after we get
back from Chicago, it is over.

12:19.533 --> 12:20.900
My sister will be gone forever.

12:20.935 --> 12:22.836
Okay, look, I get it.

12:22.870 --> 12:25.782
None of us should have
to give up our families.

12:26.941 --> 12:28.475
I know. I'm the last person
that should be saying that,

12:28.509 --> 12:30.410
because I'm the selfish
ass that went after my wife,

12:30.444 --> 12:31.829
but still...

12:32.713 --> 12:36.219
letting Flynn murder through time...

12:36.851 --> 12:38.618
that's madness.

12:38.653 --> 12:41.670
And I think somewhere deep
down, we all can admit that.

12:42.156 --> 12:45.887
Rittenhouse or not, Flynn's not
gonna stop until we stop him.

12:45.912 --> 12:48.128
So, why us?

12:48.162 --> 12:49.863
There's nobody else but us.

13:00.975 --> 13:03.638
- Hello?
- Jiya, it's me. Are you okay?

13:03.663 --> 13:05.845
Rufus, what... Did you slip me a burner?

13:05.880 --> 13:07.741
Yeah. I got it from watching
"The Wire." Listen...

13:07.766 --> 13:09.716
- Okay, where are you?
- I don't have a lot of time,

13:09.750 --> 13:11.998
right now... you are
in a lot of trouble.

13:12.023 --> 13:13.720
Whatever you did shut down the network.

13:13.745 --> 13:15.912
Mason's pissed. He's gonna
get it up and running again,

13:15.937 --> 13:17.157
and then he's going to find you.

13:17.191 --> 13:18.858
That's why I'm going to
need you to run interference.

13:18.893 --> 13:20.560
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

13:20.594 --> 13:22.796
Delay. Distract. Do whatever you can

13:22.830 --> 13:25.842
to keep them off of our
backs as long as you can.

13:25.867 --> 13:27.400
Rufus, these guys are everywhere.

13:27.435 --> 13:31.396
Jiya, we can't let them have
the time machine, all right?

13:31.421 --> 13:34.507
I'm so sorry for
putting you on the spot.

13:34.532 --> 13:36.166
The last thing I ever wanted was

13:36.210 --> 13:38.378
for you to become a
double agent... believe me.

13:38.412 --> 13:39.512
I know how hard it is.

13:39.547 --> 13:40.847
What do you mean?

13:40.881 --> 13:42.482
What the hell are you talking about?

13:42.516 --> 13:44.584
I'll explain everything to you, I swear.

13:44.618 --> 13:47.754
But you have to do this. We need you.

13:48.264 --> 13:49.838
I need you.

13:51.859 --> 13:53.312
Okay.

13:54.095 --> 13:55.895
Okay, just come back to me safe.

13:56.711 --> 13:59.633
- Promise?
- You too.

14:00.009 --> 14:02.562
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

14:11.112 --> 14:14.047
- Hi. What's up?
- Who were you talking to?

14:16.217 --> 14:17.784
Myself.

14:17.818 --> 14:20.164
I come here to think, clear my mind.

14:20.242 --> 14:22.222
There's a lot going on.

14:22.256 --> 14:24.124
Empty your pockets.

14:25.426 --> 14:26.526
Okay, a little handsy there.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.648
I don't remember swiping right.

14:47.950 --> 14:50.300
You think I was born yesterday?

14:50.816 --> 14:52.542
Hey, Singer!

14:55.550 --> 14:58.678
Put her on ice. She
doesn't leave the building.

15:12.883 --> 15:14.717
Be careful.

15:22.116 --> 15:24.250
Oh, my God, you guys, this is terrible.

15:24.285 --> 15:25.752
We stand out like sore thumbs.

15:25.786 --> 15:27.453
Well, there's no time to go shopping.

15:27.488 --> 15:28.688
Flynn's already way ahead of us.

15:28.722 --> 15:29.856
I saw we own it,

15:29.890 --> 15:31.291
embrace our fashion-forwardness,

15:31.325 --> 15:33.359
stop Flynn, and get
the hell out of here.

15:33.394 --> 15:34.961
What if Flynn has already done

15:34.995 --> 15:36.863
whatever it is he came here to do?

15:36.897 --> 15:39.966
So, March 13, 1931, Chicago.

15:40.255 --> 15:41.334
Where's Flynn headed?

15:41.368 --> 15:43.536
There's only one place I can think of.

15:43.571 --> 15:45.338
What can I say?

15:45.372 --> 15:47.207
The crooked lawyers for the prosecution

15:47.241 --> 15:49.843
somehow lost all the
evidence they had on me.

15:49.877 --> 15:51.211
But you ask me?

15:51.245 --> 15:53.546
They never had it in the first place.

15:53.787 --> 15:57.050
That's Al Capone? He looks so young.

15:57.084 --> 15:59.519
He was only 26 when
he became a crime boss.

15:59.553 --> 16:01.020
And lost them in bank failures.

16:01.055 --> 16:03.781
They should be the ones going on trial.

16:04.344 --> 16:06.159
Is he not afraid to be
out in the open like this?

16:06.193 --> 16:07.493
The people of Chicago loved him.

16:07.528 --> 16:09.562
They would chant his name at Cubs games.

16:09.597 --> 16:10.954
So, it's true, then?

16:10.979 --> 16:13.333
All charges against
you have been dropped?

16:13.367 --> 16:16.302
With no evidence, the
honorable Judge Wilkerson

16:16.337 --> 16:19.086
had no choice but to drop the case.

16:19.340 --> 16:21.074
Justice has been served.

16:24.464 --> 16:26.145
Wait, wait, wait. This isn't right.

16:26.180 --> 16:27.847
Guys, look.

16:30.084 --> 16:31.417
Go, go, go.

16:44.028 --> 16:47.100
Capone is supposed to be going
to prison for tax evasion today.

16:47.134 --> 16:48.442
Flynn must have gotten him off somehow.

16:48.467 --> 16:50.216
Well, that's not troubling at all.

16:58.448 --> 17:00.113
For some reason, none of them good,

17:00.147 --> 17:01.948
Flynn has already wormed
his way in with Capone.

17:01.982 --> 17:03.549
Well, with all that mob muscle,

17:03.584 --> 17:05.417
it's gonna be hard to get
close to Flynn or Capone.

17:05.452 --> 17:07.954
Which makes this a
first-class, grade-A cluster...

17:07.988 --> 17:10.070
- Maybe he can help.
- Mr. Ness,

17:10.096 --> 17:13.070
it appears if Al Capone
is the Untouchable One.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.031
Got a comment?

17:17.298 --> 17:19.070
Any more questions?

17:23.346 --> 17:24.736
Come on.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.290
Mr. Ness?

17:31.659 --> 17:33.179
Mr. Eliot Ness?

17:33.204 --> 17:34.470
I said no comment.

17:34.495 --> 17:36.431
Oh, we're not the press. We're, um...

17:36.447 --> 17:39.024
- We're private investigators.
- Yeah.

17:39.450 --> 17:41.384
Uh, I'm Connery.

17:41.418 --> 17:42.819
This is Costner.

17:42.853 --> 17:46.583
And this here is our
driver, Robert... De Niro.

17:47.763 --> 17:49.726
We're trying to get
information on the tall man

17:49.760 --> 17:50.860
with the dark features with Capone.

17:50.894 --> 17:52.388
Did you... did you see him?

17:52.413 --> 17:54.214
He's not from Chicago. I
haven't seen him before.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.566
No. He's definitely
not from around here.

17:56.591 --> 17:57.900
Neither are we.

17:57.935 --> 18:00.175
I can tell. Are you
wearing a woman's sweater?

18:00.200 --> 18:02.105
His name's Garcia Flynn.

18:02.139 --> 18:05.041
And we think he's
teaming up with Al Capone.

18:05.075 --> 18:07.410
He is the most dangerous
gangster in San Francisco.

18:07.444 --> 18:09.545
William Randolph Hearst...
he hired us himself

18:09.580 --> 18:10.921
to dig up some dirt on him

18:10.946 --> 18:12.180
and try and get him off the streets.

18:12.205 --> 18:14.672
Yeah. And whatever he's
up to with Capone...

18:14.938 --> 18:17.286
it's way worse than tax evasion.

18:17.321 --> 18:19.389
You know, I told them... going
after Capone for his taxes

18:19.423 --> 18:20.690
would never work.

18:20.724 --> 18:24.192
Well, it could've worked.

18:26.902 --> 18:29.011
Hey!

18:29.036 --> 18:31.081
Hey! Bathroom break?

18:39.977 --> 18:43.246
The burner... we couldn't track it.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.531
Your boyfriend covered every base.

18:45.556 --> 18:47.457
Where are they, Jiya?

18:47.618 --> 18:50.153
- Where the hell is my machine?
- I don't know.

18:50.443 --> 18:52.388
And you expect us to believe you?

18:52.423 --> 18:53.801
Look, he didn't say. He just...

18:53.826 --> 18:55.291
he just said he was worried about me.

18:55.325 --> 18:57.326
Do you have any idea how
much trouble you're in?

18:57.361 --> 19:00.554
This is the National Security
Agency. Need I remind you?

19:01.932 --> 19:03.484
Be smart.

19:03.519 --> 19:04.777
Play ball.

19:06.869 --> 19:09.143
Oh, what's so funny?

19:09.932 --> 19:13.509
You know, my first day on
the job, I was so scared,

19:13.544 --> 19:15.081
intimidated.

19:16.525 --> 19:19.487
I... I was in awe of you.

19:20.050 --> 19:22.544
I mean, I was coming to
work for the Connor Mason.

19:22.569 --> 19:24.854
I mean, my... my hero.

19:24.888 --> 19:27.489
All I wanted to do
was to make you proud.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.934
Right now, it's like
that moment where...

19:29.960 --> 19:32.528
where Dorothy pulls back the curtain,

19:32.563 --> 19:35.740
and she sees the Wizard
for who he truly is:

19:36.265 --> 19:37.896
a coward.

19:47.859 --> 19:50.728
Do you really think that this, um,

19:51.315 --> 19:55.651
childish, plucky snark
is going to help you?

19:56.009 --> 19:57.954
This is the real world.

19:57.988 --> 20:01.820
You take your time,
you think, and decide:

20:02.344 --> 20:06.875
help us or be arrested and incarcerated.

20:30.721 --> 20:33.526
Nice place. Very cozy.

20:33.551 --> 20:35.992
It's a rat trap.

20:36.026 --> 20:39.529
Capone was tipped off
as to where I lived,

20:39.563 --> 20:42.865
so started getting death threats,

20:42.900 --> 20:45.535
occasional brick through the window.

20:45.569 --> 20:49.038
Sent my wife to Cincinnati
to stay with her sister,

20:49.606 --> 20:51.507
and I moved in here.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.876
How do you cope with all that?

20:53.994 --> 20:58.049
Loved ones and family
in that much danger...

20:58.197 --> 21:00.072
How do you still go after Capone?

21:00.097 --> 21:02.065
Well, how could I not?

21:02.090 --> 21:05.166
Couldn't look my wife in the eye
and tell her that I'd given up.

21:05.656 --> 21:08.095
Couldn't look myself in the mirror.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.368
Where could we find Capone right now?

21:10.403 --> 21:11.870
We are in a little bit of a time-crunch.

21:11.904 --> 21:15.206
Garcia Flynn is very dangerous.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.708
And Capone isn't?

21:16.742 --> 21:18.476
Not by comparison.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.412
Capone? The man responsible

21:20.446 --> 21:22.080
for the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre?

21:22.114 --> 21:23.648
I think we can all agree that both men

21:23.682 --> 21:25.393
are incredibly dangerous.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.318
Why don't we just focus on finding them

21:27.353 --> 21:28.953
and stopping them from
doing whatever it is

21:28.978 --> 21:30.348
they're planning on doing?

21:31.973 --> 21:33.792
It's okay. That's Billy.
He's one of my guys.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.281
Come in.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.826
No. No. No, no, no, no, no.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.964
What? No.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.666
Eliot Ness... he can't be dead.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.434
He's not supposed to
die for another 26 years.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.669
How'd they even know he was here?

22:17.703 --> 22:19.437
How do you think? Flynn.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.885
This can't be happening. I mean,
Capone is out there on the loose,

22:21.910 --> 22:24.209
and the only guy that
can stop him is gone!

22:24.743 --> 22:26.214
We got to get out of here right now.

22:26.239 --> 22:27.712
We're just supposed to
leave him here like this?

22:27.746 --> 22:29.284
What do you want to
do? Wait for the cops?

22:29.309 --> 22:30.482
We don't have IDs.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.984
I'm wearing button-fly
jeans from The Gap.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.686
There's nothing we can do.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.292
- Where are we going?
- To find Capone.

22:50.317 --> 22:53.684
- What about Flynn?
- One problem at a time.

22:53.839 --> 22:56.696
Stop saying that. Why
do you keep saying that?

22:59.545 --> 23:01.479
Do you know what the very
first Delta mission was?

23:01.514 --> 23:03.148
1979, Iran.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.749
That's right.

23:04.783 --> 23:07.229
Go get the hostages out of Tehran.

23:07.254 --> 23:09.899
One of my Delta instructors...
name is Diamond Dave...

23:09.924 --> 23:11.723
he was on that mission.

23:11.757 --> 23:13.525
The plane carrying the operatives

23:13.559 --> 23:15.994
lands in the desert somewhere to refuel.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.228
While it's on the ground,

23:17.263 --> 23:18.787
a Navy helicopter crashes into it

23:18.812 --> 23:20.154
due to the heavy winds.

23:20.179 --> 23:23.031
So, Dave... he wakes up from a nap.

23:23.056 --> 23:24.936
He sees the plane is on fire.

23:25.326 --> 23:27.094
Now, he still thinks
they're 20,000 feet up.

23:27.119 --> 23:29.250
He can't find a parachute,
so he just flings himself

23:29.275 --> 23:31.009
right out the door,
right through the smoke.

23:31.034 --> 23:32.783
Okay, this is all really nice, but
what is the point of this story?

23:32.808 --> 23:34.879
So the guys afterwards asked Dave,

23:34.904 --> 23:36.838
"If you thought we were
20,000 feet in the air,

23:36.873 --> 23:38.640
"why the hell would you
fling yourself out the door

23:38.675 --> 23:39.741
"without a parachute?"

23:39.776 --> 23:41.870
Dave just looks at him and he says,

23:41.895 --> 23:44.146
"All I knew was the plane was on fire,

23:44.180 --> 23:46.309
"and I figured one problem at a time."

23:53.222 --> 23:56.372
First, we stop Capone,

23:56.559 --> 23:58.727
and then we worry about
what Flynn wants with him

23:58.761 --> 24:00.195
and everything else.

24:00.229 --> 24:03.265
So, if Al Capone is
supposed to be behind bars,

24:03.299 --> 24:04.733
how do we put him there?

24:04.767 --> 24:07.996
I don't know. I mean,
without Ness, this is just...

24:09.372 --> 24:10.665
Lucy?

24:11.035 --> 24:12.550
I know who we can ask.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.351
Hello. I'm so sorry
to bother you so late,

24:22.385 --> 24:25.574
but are you by any chance Richard Hart?

24:25.984 --> 24:27.451
What can I do for you?

24:27.476 --> 24:30.746
Well, uh, we need your help.

24:31.060 --> 24:32.712
It's about your brother,

24:33.896 --> 24:35.376
Al Capone.

24:39.458 --> 24:41.114
Look. I don't know who
you people think I am.

24:41.130 --> 24:42.430
You're Jimmy Capone,

24:42.465 --> 24:44.332
born James Vincenzo Capone.

24:44.366 --> 24:45.867
My name's Richard Hart.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.146
You left Brooklyn when you were 16

24:47.171 --> 24:49.137
and changed your name for a fresh start,

24:49.171 --> 24:51.206
and wound up becoming
a Prohibition Agent.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.718
And you haven't seen your family
or your brother ever since you left.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.802
But you know what Al's been up to.

24:55.845 --> 24:57.479
You can't read the morning
paper without seeing his name.

24:57.513 --> 24:59.328
Keep it down, will you?

25:00.249 --> 25:03.184
My wife and kids don't
know my real name.

25:03.219 --> 25:04.956
Nobody does.

25:07.066 --> 25:08.556
Did Al send you?

25:08.591 --> 25:11.159
We look like mobsters to you?

25:11.193 --> 25:13.915
You're from the bureau,
then? Is that what this is?

25:13.940 --> 25:15.331
I work hard.

25:15.356 --> 25:16.603
I don't take bribes.

25:16.628 --> 25:17.907
Just because I was born a Capone,

25:17.932 --> 25:19.300
that doesn't mean I act like one.

25:19.335 --> 25:21.002
We know. You're a good
man and an honorable cop,

25:21.036 --> 25:22.440
and that's why we came
to you in the first place.

25:22.465 --> 25:24.654
- We really need your help.
- Who is it, dear?

25:25.391 --> 25:27.326
Honey, it's...

25:27.351 --> 25:29.146
- these people are lost.
- Sorry.

25:29.171 --> 25:32.599
Just gonna give them directions
out of here. Won't be a minute.

25:38.053 --> 25:39.487
Now, listen to me...

25:39.522 --> 25:40.922
Your little brother Al

25:40.956 --> 25:43.464
just sent Eliot Ness to the morgue.

25:47.917 --> 25:50.365
I'm sorry to hear that.

25:50.399 --> 25:52.486
Truly, I am.

25:53.869 --> 25:55.436
But what do you want with me?

25:55.471 --> 25:57.375
We need you to bring
us to see your brother.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.813
- What?
- In person.

25:58.838 --> 25:59.884
You crazy?

25:59.909 --> 26:01.899
And then we need you to arrest him.

26:04.458 --> 26:06.158
You are crazy.

26:11.756 --> 26:13.421
Al!

26:13.455 --> 26:15.223
Where's the fire?

26:15.257 --> 26:18.059
I was having dinner with
Wrigley and some broads

26:18.093 --> 26:22.630
when this Neanderthal drags me
out like I'm some kind of Joe.

26:25.267 --> 26:26.727
Who's this guy?

26:26.752 --> 26:28.479
This is the guy

26:28.504 --> 26:30.605
who touched the Untouchable Eliot Ness.

26:30.639 --> 26:32.401
Garcia Flynn.

26:32.426 --> 26:33.942
Nice to meet you, Mr. Mayor.

26:33.976 --> 26:35.944
How'd you know where Ness was holed up?

26:35.969 --> 26:38.429
- I couldn't even find out.
- Exactly.

26:38.454 --> 26:40.481
He's done more for me in one day

26:40.516 --> 26:43.251
than you've done since I
put your sorry ass in office.

26:43.277 --> 26:45.766
And the only thing he asked in return...

26:45.799 --> 26:47.734
was to talk to you.

26:47.990 --> 26:49.531
Is that so?

26:49.825 --> 26:51.092
What the hell about?

26:54.875 --> 26:56.598
Are you crazy?

26:56.632 --> 26:58.233
I'm the mayor of Chicago.

26:58.267 --> 27:00.421
And also a member of Rittenhouse.

27:02.838 --> 27:05.813
- Who sent you?
- I sent myself.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.843
I have some questions,

27:08.877 --> 27:11.145
and I need some honest answers.

27:11.180 --> 27:14.282
Mr. Hart, Al should be in prison.

27:14.316 --> 27:16.751
We need you to bring him in
before he kills any more people.

27:16.785 --> 27:19.087
I don't have anything
to do with my brother.

27:19.121 --> 27:21.656
- Leave me out of it.
- You're a federal agent.

27:21.690 --> 27:23.809
I ticket rummies on the street.

27:23.834 --> 27:25.913
I'm no Ness. I'm no Untouchable.

27:25.938 --> 27:28.830
And like you said, I haven't
seen Al in over 20 years.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.632
What makes you think I
could just waltz in there

27:30.666 --> 27:33.207
- and see him now?
- You can try.

27:33.869 --> 27:36.604
What makes you think I'd want to?

27:36.639 --> 27:38.567
He's my little brother.

27:39.041 --> 27:40.675
I love the stupid son of a bitch.

27:40.709 --> 27:44.145
I wiped his damn nose, took
him to buy candy on the corner.

27:44.179 --> 27:45.680
What makes you think
that I want to be the one

27:45.714 --> 27:47.162
- to put him behind bars?
- Mr. Hart...

27:47.187 --> 27:48.802
We're done here.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.486
And if you tell anyone who I am,

27:51.520 --> 27:54.492
you're gonna have more than
one Capone to worry about.

27:56.892 --> 27:59.861
Did you know that he takes
ads out in newspapers,

28:00.113 --> 28:01.546
looking for you?

28:01.633 --> 28:03.868
All over the country, for years.

28:05.511 --> 28:07.316
He misses you.

28:08.881 --> 28:11.749
I understand how hard it
must be for you to face him.

28:13.208 --> 28:14.809
I've had to give up family, too,

28:14.843 --> 28:16.044
and nobody should have to do that,

28:16.078 --> 28:18.377
but maybe he will listen to you.

28:18.614 --> 28:21.330
- Maybe you could save him.
- Al's beyond being saved.

28:21.355 --> 28:23.885
Mr. Hart, out of all the
jobs that you could've chosen,

28:23.919 --> 28:25.386
you pick cop.

28:25.421 --> 28:27.088
I mean, why is that?

28:27.122 --> 28:28.423
I mean, don't you think
it's because you want

28:28.457 --> 28:30.858
to set right what Al has done wrong,

28:30.893 --> 28:33.908
because you know that
somebody has to stop him?

28:34.863 --> 28:37.525
No matter how hard it is to do,

28:37.869 --> 28:39.667
you have to do what's right.

28:39.702 --> 28:41.501
You have to help us.

28:43.446 --> 28:45.456
There's nobody else but you.

28:51.213 --> 28:52.380
Aah!

28:52.414 --> 28:53.681
Hey, watch where you're bleeding.

28:53.716 --> 28:54.849
That's an antique.

28:54.883 --> 28:56.784
Tell me about the meeting.

28:56.819 --> 28:59.620
I don't know what you're
talking about. What meeting?

28:59.655 --> 29:04.132
The one Julian Charvet told me
about in Paris four years ago.

29:04.687 --> 29:07.729
Julian Charvet was killed
in Paris four years ago.

29:07.763 --> 29:09.999
Felt like it was yesterday.

29:11.934 --> 29:14.469
In his last few breaths,

29:14.503 --> 29:16.971
he told me about this
Rittenhouse meeting

29:17.005 --> 29:19.307
where all members get together,

29:19.341 --> 29:21.075
but he didn't have the details,

29:21.100 --> 29:25.131
so here I am, asking you the details.

29:25.186 --> 29:26.796
Try the bat.

29:26.821 --> 29:28.389
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

29:28.414 --> 29:30.859
The meeting was two years ago, okay?

29:30.884 --> 29:32.819
- Two years ago.
- Where?

29:33.526 --> 29:35.060
D.C.

29:35.085 --> 29:37.325
All the Rittenhouse
big shots get together

29:37.359 --> 29:39.994
to make sure everyone's
on the same page.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.498
But it only happens every 25 years.

29:42.523 --> 29:45.600
- The next summit is not until...
- 1954.

29:45.625 --> 29:47.734
Yeah. 1954. Long time to wait.

29:47.759 --> 29:49.604
Not as long as you'd think.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.441
No, no. Stop. Stop.

29:53.475 --> 29:56.110
- Al, you can't do this!
- I'm not gonna do anything.

29:56.145 --> 29:57.612
He's the one who wants you dead.

29:57.646 --> 29:59.104
But I don't want the mess.

29:59.129 --> 30:01.482
Take him down to the docks.

30:01.517 --> 30:04.152
No! Ugh!

30:04.186 --> 30:05.820
Thank you for the introduction.

30:05.854 --> 30:07.551
Hey, thank you.

30:07.668 --> 30:09.824
Between those tax ledgers and Ness,

30:09.858 --> 30:12.840
you killed two very big
headaches for me today.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.783
But the way I see it,

30:15.808 --> 30:17.807
I still owe you one.

30:17.833 --> 30:20.196
And I hate owing favors.

30:21.048 --> 30:23.796
I think I know a way to make it even.

30:32.306 --> 30:34.039
Swanky digs.

30:34.055 --> 30:37.190
Lexington Hotel was the
height of luxury at the time.

30:37.225 --> 30:39.040
At the time of what?

30:39.548 --> 30:41.495
Hey, are you ready for this?

30:41.529 --> 30:43.564
Hell no, I'm not ready.

30:43.971 --> 30:45.772
Leaving home was the
smartest thing I ever done.

30:45.797 --> 30:47.698
This was the dumbest.

30:54.301 --> 30:55.744
Hey!

30:57.145 --> 30:58.799
Frank Galluccio.

31:02.984 --> 31:04.838
Looks like you finally hit puberty, huh?

31:04.863 --> 31:06.130
Who the hell are you?

31:06.155 --> 31:07.956
Who the hell am I?

31:08.354 --> 31:11.389
I'm the one that broke
your nose over Shelly Russo.

31:14.462 --> 31:17.202
Jimmy, is that you?

31:17.966 --> 31:19.897
We figured you were dead.

31:20.204 --> 31:21.554
Not yet.

31:22.405 --> 31:23.641
Who are they?

31:23.666 --> 31:25.282
They're friends of mine.

31:25.376 --> 31:27.744
Al's gonna be over the
moon when he sees you.

31:27.779 --> 31:29.243
Come on.

31:30.982 --> 31:32.984
- You know what I just realized?
- What?

31:33.009 --> 31:35.478
We're totally the
Untouchables right now.

31:35.503 --> 31:36.697
Oh, boy.

32:09.587 --> 32:11.440
Come on...

32:27.917 --> 32:29.975
- We're up.
- That's great.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.131
Where are they?

32:31.876 --> 32:33.043
1931.

32:33.077 --> 32:34.945
March the 13th, Chicago, Illinois.

32:34.979 --> 32:36.670
When they jump back,

32:36.704 --> 32:38.394
we can track their general area.

32:38.419 --> 32:40.217
Well, that's a start.

32:40.251 --> 32:42.252
Get teams ready to roll.

33:00.171 --> 33:01.938
What the hell happened?

33:01.963 --> 33:03.725
You said you had them.

33:16.435 --> 33:18.234
What did you do?

33:19.342 --> 33:21.176
I still have to pee.

33:28.067 --> 33:30.467
Hey, boss. Sorry to interrupt,

33:30.501 --> 33:32.925
but your brother's here to see you.

33:32.950 --> 33:34.137
I'm busy.

33:34.172 --> 33:36.137
Tell Ralphie to come
back in the morning.

33:36.162 --> 33:37.796
It ain't Ralphie.

33:44.982 --> 33:46.349
Jimmy?

33:46.384 --> 33:48.096
I was in the neighborhood.

33:50.988 --> 33:54.339
You got a lot of damn nerve showing
up here after all these years.

33:54.826 --> 33:56.126
You gained weight.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.421
Yeah. You got old.

34:13.210 --> 34:14.543
Who are they?

34:14.579 --> 34:16.581
These are my friends.

34:16.981 --> 34:18.879
Even that guy?

34:19.150 --> 34:20.683
I'm likeable.

34:21.409 --> 34:23.502
You people ain't from Chicago.

34:23.527 --> 34:26.022
We're from California, actually.

34:26.056 --> 34:28.859
Ah, land of the fruits and nuts.

34:29.456 --> 34:30.860
That explains it.

34:31.150 --> 34:33.400
Boy, first time I'm seeing

34:33.426 --> 34:35.831
these famous scars on your
face... that's something.

34:35.867 --> 34:38.080
Don't say the nickname they gave me.

34:38.487 --> 34:39.902
I freakin' hate it.

34:39.937 --> 34:43.340
The papers say you got them
in the war, but come on.

34:43.373 --> 34:45.690
What's the real story?

34:46.377 --> 34:47.956
Between us?

34:48.880 --> 34:50.974
When we were teenagers,

34:51.248 --> 34:53.149
I insulted Frank's sister.

34:53.184 --> 34:55.482
This was his way of getting back at me.

34:55.853 --> 34:57.721
Frankie, you did this?

34:57.755 --> 34:59.089
He deserved it.

34:59.123 --> 35:02.392
Bosses had us sit down, make peace.

35:03.861 --> 35:06.347
Frankie's one of my best guys now.

35:09.066 --> 35:11.230
I'm a Prohibition Agent.

35:12.803 --> 35:14.277
Get out of here.

35:14.568 --> 35:16.206
You're a G-man?

35:19.206 --> 35:20.787
Not a very good one.

35:27.818 --> 35:29.452
So, what are you doing here?

35:29.487 --> 35:30.921
You in some kind of
trouble or something?

35:30.955 --> 35:33.967
- Maybe I'm here to see you.
- After all these years?

35:34.392 --> 35:36.893
Come on. Let's not lie
to each other, Jimmy.

35:36.928 --> 35:39.896
Actually, we were the ones
that asked him to come here.

35:39.931 --> 35:41.197
We're looking for someone.

35:41.232 --> 35:44.280
Tall guy. Name is Garcia Flynn.

35:44.502 --> 35:47.771
Yeah. He was here.

35:47.805 --> 35:49.306
Man of his word.

35:49.340 --> 35:51.274
Did a couple favors for me.

35:51.551 --> 35:53.051
I did one for him.

35:53.180 --> 35:55.712
Did he happen to mention Rittenhouse?

35:55.746 --> 35:59.583
Yeah, something about a
summit in D.C. in 1954.

35:59.617 --> 36:02.085
All of them all together,
whatever that means.

36:02.119 --> 36:04.801
Jimmy, tell me you didn't
come here just to ask me

36:04.826 --> 36:06.379
about this guy Flynn.

36:13.951 --> 36:15.952
I'm here to bring you in, Al.

36:26.844 --> 36:28.345
You're serious?

36:28.379 --> 36:30.747
It's one thing raising
hell as kids in Brooklyn,

36:30.781 --> 36:32.515
but you're out of control.

36:32.550 --> 36:34.117
I'm sorry, Al. I love you.

36:34.151 --> 36:36.918
But someone has to stop you
before you hurt more folks.

36:36.943 --> 36:40.357
You got some balls walking in
here out of the blue like this.

36:40.391 --> 36:42.611
Dad died 11 years ago.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.161
Our brother... remember
him? Back in '24.

36:45.196 --> 36:46.253
Did you know that?

36:46.278 --> 36:47.651
- Do you even care?
- Of course I care.

36:47.676 --> 36:49.633
But not enough to come to the funerals.

36:49.667 --> 36:51.601
Ma was heartbroken, you know.

36:51.636 --> 36:53.603
I started wondering if
you were even still alive.

36:53.638 --> 36:57.663
And now you show up here saying
you're some damn federal agent?

36:57.688 --> 37:00.302
And that you and these
clowns are gonna bring me in?

37:04.157 --> 37:07.817
That guy Flynn said these three
might come looking for him.

37:07.852 --> 37:11.290
And when he left, he asked
me to do him one more favor.

37:11.856 --> 37:13.356
And being a man of my word...

37:13.391 --> 37:15.472
- Oh!
- No, no, no. Please!

37:15.497 --> 37:17.227
Please. Please.

37:17.261 --> 37:19.663
I made a deal to take
out the colored fella.

37:19.697 --> 37:21.798
Flynn says they can't
follow him if I do.

37:21.832 --> 37:23.733
- Can't let you do that.
- Jimmy.

37:23.758 --> 37:25.648
You'd pull a gun on me?

37:25.783 --> 37:27.320
Your own brother?

37:32.683 --> 37:34.168
Lower your weapon, Al.

37:34.199 --> 37:36.229
What are you gonna do? You
gonna... you gonna shoot me?

37:36.254 --> 37:38.343
- I don't want to.
- But you want to take me to prison,

37:38.368 --> 37:39.368
is that right?

37:39.393 --> 37:41.761
Oh, Dad must be turning over
in his damn grave right now.

37:41.767 --> 37:43.468
Dad wasn't around to
see what you became.

37:43.493 --> 37:45.118
Neither were you!

37:46.134 --> 37:48.397
You want to know why I disappeared?

37:48.431 --> 37:50.065
Because I saw what you were becoming,

37:50.100 --> 37:52.759
and I didn't want to end
up like that, like all this.

37:52.806 --> 37:56.237
I may be a Capone, but you
and I are nothing alike.

37:57.870 --> 38:00.823
You're right. We're not.

38:01.284 --> 38:02.874
But we're family.

38:02.909 --> 38:06.011
And family's more
important than anything,

38:06.045 --> 38:08.402
which is why I know...

38:08.427 --> 38:10.262
you won't shoot.

38:15.154 --> 38:16.678
Aah!

38:23.132 --> 38:25.133
Oh, my God. Rufus?

38:25.186 --> 38:27.522
He shot me.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.760
You got to stop the bleeding.

39:04.871 --> 39:07.072
What's the status on this outage?

39:07.106 --> 39:08.407
Oh, everything's on track.

39:08.441 --> 39:10.008
We'll be up and running in a few hours.

39:10.043 --> 39:12.245
And you'll be able to locate
them when they jump back?

39:12.270 --> 39:14.413
Within a 50-square-mile radius, yes.

39:14.447 --> 39:17.282
All we'll need is time.

39:18.659 --> 39:20.070
Good.

39:23.823 --> 39:28.714
But if you want speedier
results going forward...

39:30.737 --> 39:32.097
Yes?

39:32.131 --> 39:36.988
I assume you know about
the NSA Data Farm in Utah.

39:37.370 --> 39:40.947
I need access to their
12 exabytes of raw data,

39:40.972 --> 39:43.642
which I have a sneaking
suspicion you can provide.

39:43.676 --> 39:45.533
And what will you do with it?

39:46.145 --> 39:50.282
My team has developed
advanced mining software,

39:50.316 --> 39:52.584
more advanced than anything
the NSA will produce

39:52.618 --> 39:55.009
in the next ten years.

39:55.034 --> 39:57.856
It gives us the ability
to tap into cell phones,

39:57.890 --> 39:59.091
email accounts, satellites,

39:59.125 --> 40:00.992
traffic cams, that sort of thing.

40:01.027 --> 40:04.529
Now, not only will we
be able to find Lucy,

40:04.564 --> 40:07.132
Rufus, Wyatt Logan,

40:07.166 --> 40:08.500
Garcia Flynn,

40:08.534 --> 40:10.258
and the Lifeboat,

40:10.903 --> 40:12.899
but if our test works,

40:13.490 --> 40:16.750
we'll have the capability
to pinpoint anyone,

40:16.961 --> 40:18.524
anywhere,

40:18.845 --> 40:20.846
at any time you want.

40:24.550 --> 40:27.422
Or we could, of course, just
wait and hope for the best.

40:31.391 --> 40:33.600
- How bad is it?
- Bullet's still in there.

40:33.625 --> 40:34.960
We got to get him to a hospital.

40:34.994 --> 40:37.329
In the '30s? No way.

40:37.363 --> 40:39.164
They were segregated, and not good.

40:39.198 --> 40:41.633
Yeah, well, we can't exactly
march him into an ER back home.

40:41.667 --> 40:45.007
Our faces are on every single
government watch list out there.

40:45.203 --> 40:47.038
I'm sorry, Rufus. I'm so sorry.

40:47.073 --> 40:49.908
I should've... I
should've reacted faster.

40:49.942 --> 40:51.777
One problem at a time, right?

40:53.928 --> 40:55.180
Yeah.

40:55.214 --> 40:57.334
Get me to the Lifeboat.
I'll take us home.

40:58.751 --> 41:01.990
Police are on the way. Ambulance too.

41:02.404 --> 41:04.222
I don't know if we can wait that long.

41:04.257 --> 41:05.490
He's lost a lot of blood.

41:05.525 --> 41:08.101
- Can you stand?
- Yeah.

41:11.623 --> 41:13.290
We're just gonna take
him there ourselves.

41:13.328 --> 41:15.734
Thank you for your help. I
know this was hard for you.

41:15.768 --> 41:17.293
I'm sorry.

41:28.832 --> 41:30.424
Okay, Wyatt...

41:31.911 --> 41:35.013
Come on, Rufus. Stay with us.

41:38.308 --> 41:39.708
Okay, Rufus.

41:39.892 --> 41:41.560
- Got to buckle him in.
- Rufus, look at me.

41:41.586 --> 41:43.921
You have to get us back,
okay? We don't know how.

41:43.963 --> 41:45.527
Come on, buddy.

41:45.810 --> 41:47.098
- I just...
- Good.

41:47.123 --> 41:48.325
I just...

41:48.601 --> 41:49.957
Come here, buddy.

41:50.937 --> 41:53.405
You want me to push a button? This one?

41:53.439 --> 41:54.966
This one right here?

41:54.991 --> 41:57.076
- In the seat. In the seat.
- Right here. Okay.

41:57.101 --> 41:58.643
You got this, Rufus. Come on.

42:01.913 --> 42:03.701
Stick with us, Rufus!

42:03.726 --> 42:05.006
Tell Jiya...

42:05.031 --> 42:07.263
We're buckled in. Get us out of here.

42:08.050 --> 42:09.828
- What?
- Rufus.

42:10.226 --> 42:11.593
Rufus!

42:12.008 --> 42:13.687
- Rufus!
- Hey!
