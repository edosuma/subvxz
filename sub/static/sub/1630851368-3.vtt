I'm so sorry, bro.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.840

the head 'cause I was like,

33:29.908 --> 33:31.575
if it's my foot,
if it's my wrist,

33:31.643 --> 33:32.909
then like I'll just do
with one arm,

33:32.978 --> 33:34.411
but then, like,
you get one head.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.079
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:36.148 --> 33:39.683
- I am devastated.
I know he wanted this so bad.

33:39.752 --> 33:41.985
I really wanted to run
this game with him.

33:42.054 --> 33:44.621
<i> "Survivor" is--</i>

33:44.690 --> 33:48.692

I feel really alone.

33:48.761 --> 33:52.529
Having you in this game
has been, like, the best thing,

33:52.598 --> 33:54.865
and I'm just gonna miss you.

33:54.933 --> 33:57.334

honestly, in this game.

33:57.403 --> 33:59.302
You really are.
- Yeah.

33:59.371 --> 34:05.642
- Aw!
Come here. My Big T.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.344
- I want to talk to you alone.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.780
- Yeah, you can talk
to me alone.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.048
Let's go.

34:11.116 --> 34:14.484
- I'm so sorry
this has happened to you.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.354
- It's all right.
Don't worry about me.

34:17.423 --> 34:20.857
If anything, the only time
you should remember me is,

34:20.926 --> 34:22.259

when you're too lazy

34:22.327 --> 34:25.429
to go on the treadmill,
get your ass on the treadmill.

34:25.497 --> 34:27.564
That's all I want,
to train for that final.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.733
And then I'll know
I had a part of you winning.

34:29.802 --> 34:31.468
- Thank you
for being so genuine.

34:31.537 --> 34:32.969
Like, you're a good person,
Tommy.

34:33.038 --> 34:35.439
And it just sucks
that it happened to you.

34:35.507 --> 34:38.875
This is my worst
"Challenge" day ever.

34:38.944 --> 34:40.777
It's just one thing
after the other.

34:40.846 --> 34:44.247
Tommy's gone.
Tori's won.

34:44.316 --> 34:46.750
The vets are calling me rat.

34:46.819 --> 34:50.954
I'm completely alone.
I feel like this is the end.

I feel like my ass

I know it's a game and, like,

36:14.606 --> 36:16.106

36:21.113 --> 36:24.681

- Uh, yeah.
I ain't got too much to say,

36:28.387 --> 36:29.986

I'm cool with all of y'all,

I know it's a competition.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.392
You know what I'm saying?
Ain't nothing personal.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.327
You know what I'm saying.
But if I go down there,

36:37.396 --> 36:39.863
I'm coming back in, bro.
At the end of the day,

36:39.932 --> 36:42.566
I know y'all got to do
what y'all got to do, but--

36:42.634 --> 36:45.969
- That leads me to the question
that I always want to know

36:46.038 --> 36:47.737
when somebody is hearing
their name

36:47.806 --> 36:49.506
getting flown around.

36:49.575 --> 36:53.143
And it is "If not you,
then who?"

36:53.212 --> 36:54.444
- Okay.

36:54.513 --> 36:57.581
So if not Jeremiah and Tacha,
Michele and Corey L.

36:57.649 --> 36:58.715
- Why?
- Why?

36:58.784 --> 36:59.983
- We're all freakin' rookies.

37:00.052 --> 37:01.718
I have to say your name
'cause like--

37:01.787 --> 37:04.187
- You have to?
Do you have to say my name?

37:09.361 --> 37:13.063
- That leads me to the question
that--"if not you, then who?"

37:17.302 --> 37:18.501
- Okay.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.771
So if not Jeremiah and Tacha,
Michele and Corey L.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.306
- Why?
- Why?

37:23.375 --> 37:25.675
- It's just, like, two options
here on the table.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.110
I have to say your name
'cause, like...

37:27.179 --> 37:28.912
- You have to?
Do you have to say my name?

37:28.981 --> 37:30.714
- 'Cause it's like
it's both of you guys.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.415
You get what I'm saying?
It's Michele and Corey L.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.017
And it's Tacha and Jeremiah.

37:34.086 --> 37:35.919
And we're all freaking rookies,
like four freaking rookies.

37:35.988 --> 37:39.389
- Tacha and Jeremiah,
it's your time.

37:39.458 --> 37:40.690

37:40.759 --> 37:42.158
<i> Don't make excuses.</i>

37:42.227 --> 37:43.627
<i> Prove that you deserve</i>
<i> to be here,</i>

37:43.695 --> 37:46.997
because, right now,
everyone is doubting you.

37:47.065 --> 37:48.798
- It's the game.
And I'm all here to play.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.767
Everyone is here to play it.
And that's it.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.168
- I have yet to hear a reason,

37:52.237 --> 37:54.104
but I'll let Michele speak.
- No. And I understand,

37:54.172 --> 37:56.940
like, you know, you're put
under the gun of a name to say,

37:57.009 --> 38:00.043
and I know that our names
have been consistently

38:00.112 --> 38:01.645
floating around,
I mean,

38:01.713 --> 38:03.213
but I understand
where you're coming from, that

38:03.282 --> 38:04.914
you're backed against a wall
and you have to say.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.249
- It's nothing personal.
- I have no hard feelings.

38:06.318 --> 38:07.450
I get it.

38:07.519 --> 38:08.685
- Exactly.
- I get it.

38:08.754 --> 38:09.719
- No hard feelings.
It's a game.

38:09.788 --> 38:10.854
And we have to play it.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.355
- I'm also looking
at Big T here,

38:12.424 --> 38:16.293
and I'm seeing Tommy's
not standing behind her.

38:16.361 --> 38:18.795
- There's a solid chance

38:18.864 --> 38:20.664
that we go down
into the Lair tonight,

38:20.732 --> 38:23.867
and it is just
a female elimination.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.402
So again, I know
that everyone's in here

38:25.470 --> 38:28.171
thinking about who's
the house vote gonna be.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.173
You could be going
in there tonight

38:30.242 --> 38:33.343
without having said
anything in this room.

38:33.412 --> 38:36.680
And if that's your--if that's
your strategy, go for it.

38:44.122 --> 38:46.222
<i> - Big T, is she with the vets?</i>

38:46.291 --> 38:47.857
Is she working
with the rookies?

38:47.926 --> 38:50.093
Like, what's going on?
Right now is the perfect time

38:50.162 --> 38:53.229
<i> for her to speak up</i>
<i> on the situation.</i>

38:53.298 --> 38:55.098
- If you're walking around
and you think you're safe,

38:55.167 --> 38:57.901
that's probably when you should
be looking behind your back.

38:57.969 --> 39:00.403
And everybody who's played
this game multiple times,

39:00.472 --> 39:01.771
we're not stupid.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.540
So if you're having
conversations with people,

39:03.608 --> 39:04.841
just know that that [bleep]

39:04.910 --> 39:06.176
is probably
spreading through the house

39:06.244 --> 39:08.812
and people are talking
about you talking to people.

39:12.284 --> 39:14.050
- I'm actually getting a bit
fed up with people

39:14.119 --> 39:15.552
thinking that I'm plotting.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.787
At the end of the day,
I can be friends with people

39:17.856 --> 39:20.890
in this game and separate game
and friendship.

39:20.959 --> 39:23.059
Ashley and Amanda,
you two are best friends.

39:23.128 --> 39:25.628
Nany and Kaycee, you spent
a lot of time together.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.365
Aneesa and Tori,
you're very close.

39:28.934 --> 39:31.634
- What happens to people
that are close, Big T?

39:31.703 --> 39:34.137
You throw them
against each other.

39:34.206 --> 39:36.573
- Oh!
- Oh, [bleep].

39:37.476 --> 39:40.410
- Tori, she doesn't know how
to shut her mouth sometimes.

39:40.479 --> 39:43.046
So I don't think it's
a good idea that she's saying

39:43.115 --> 39:46.316
Big T's name right now,
especially

39:46.385 --> 39:49.285
because we're supposed
to have this "vet alliance."

39:49.354 --> 39:50.920
<i> You got to be careful</i>
<i> what you say in this house,</i>

39:50.989 --> 39:52.455

and the names

39:52.524 --> 39:54.090
that you throw out there,

39:54.159 --> 39:56.493
because it will come around and
bite you in the ass later on.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.495
- And me and you were close
last season,

39:58.563 --> 40:00.397
but you voted for me.

intimidated or bullied.

I have to seriously weigh out
