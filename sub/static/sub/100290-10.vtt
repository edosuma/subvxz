WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:10.280
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:10.360 --> 00:12.200
<i>The last ratings were insane.</i>

00:12.280 --> 00:15.880
<i>Superinfluencer Luma decided</i>
<i>by herself who she'll block</i>

00:15.960 --> 00:19.520
<i>and will put herself on the line</i>
<i>to share the news in person.</i>

00:26.720 --> 00:27.680
Oh, God.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.160
Hi.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.080
I'm Luma.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.680
No way!

00:43.760 --> 00:45.400
I'm shocked.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.640
Oh, wow.
I didn't think you were a catfish.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.200
I'm Luma, too.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.240
What? You're twins, and you...

00:56.320 --> 00:57.640
No way! Who...

00:57.720 --> 00:59.000
-Wow!
-What's up?

00:59.520 --> 01:02.720
Oh, my God! What the hell?

01:02.800 --> 01:04.480
Not everything is fake.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.160
One is fine. But two?

01:08.600 --> 01:09.440
Shall we sit?

01:10.800 --> 01:13.120
Lucas, Marcel.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.440
-I think you know why you're blocked.
-Yes, I know.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.280
The breakfast thing.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.040
-You lied in the chat.
-The breakfast.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.840
And also, you were being shady
in the group chat.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.680
I wasn't taking a dig at you,
I was taking a dig at Ray.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.840
When Akel came over, he said,

01:28.920 --> 01:30.960
"Ray talked to me

01:31.040 --> 01:34.280
and said she shipped us,
so we could become RaKel."

01:34.360 --> 01:37.400
-And she said she was into JP.
-Really?

01:37.480 --> 01:39.960
Who do you think
the biggest threat in the game is?

01:40.040 --> 01:42.800
In my opinion, it's JP.

01:42.880 --> 01:45.720
-He's manipulating everything.
-Everything.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.840
He's two-faced. He's the dirtiest player.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.000
Blocking me was 50% fair

01:52.080 --> 01:54.600
because I screwed up. I can't deny it.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.520
Bye.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.440
-Bye.
-See you.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.440
-Knock 'em dead!
-Leave it to us.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.520
-Okay?
-The key is...

01:59.600 --> 02:00.680
-Kisses.
-Kisses.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.600
Yes, you can make friends here.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.800
In my case, the friendship I had
with Marina and Akel was very real.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.400
"Blocked."

02:09.480 --> 02:11.360
I'm speechless.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.960
<i>I'm shook.</i>

02:13.240 --> 02:15.120
<i>How is everybody else going to react?</i>

02:17.320 --> 02:18.200
Yikes.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.560
Oh... my... God!

02:22.760 --> 02:25.080
Guys, Lorayne...

02:25.160 --> 02:28.440
was blocked!

02:32.560 --> 02:35.440
Good always triumphs over evil.
And here's the result.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.440
No, dude...

02:48.520 --> 02:49.960
No.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.280
So, bye Lorayne.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.120
Now I'm by myself.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.200
I'm glad Lorayne told us

03:02.920 --> 03:03.920
about Ray.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.880
She wanted an alliance with Akel,

03:05.960 --> 03:07.560
who is Lorayne's crush.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.120
She tried to help Ray,

03:09.200 --> 03:11.360
and Ray pulled the rug
from under her feet.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.880
Kisses, Lorayne.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.560
Good night, Circle.

03:15.240 --> 03:16.320
<i>Is it just me</i>

03:16.400 --> 03:18.760
<i>or are there a lot of people happy</i>
<i>with the blocking?</i>

03:19.080 --> 03:20.280
<i>What a night!</i>

03:23.480 --> 03:25.000
<i>But </i>The Circle<i> never stops,</i>

03:25.080 --> 03:27.640
<i>and it's time for the players</i>
<i>to face a new day.</i>

03:35.880 --> 03:37.400
Now we're seven.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.800
Heading toward the next...

03:39.520 --> 03:40.400
elimination.

03:40.480 --> 03:43.200
Looking at the alliance I am in,

03:43.280 --> 03:45.560
we are even stronger now.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.720
<i>The Circle</i> is coming to an end.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.280
There will come a time
when you'll need to play against

03:50.360 --> 03:53.360
someone who was your ally
for a very long time.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.160
<i>Those were some truth bombs.</i>

04:02.320 --> 04:04.320
-"Update your status."
-"Update your status."

04:04.400 --> 04:05.400
Lucas!

04:05.480 --> 04:07.160
I have a stomachache!

04:08.760 --> 04:10.160
Update status.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.840
I want them

04:11.920 --> 04:13.520
to at least smile a little.

04:13.600 --> 04:17.040
I woke up feeling emotional,
thinking about you all.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.440
I want to take a salt bath, comma...

04:19.520 --> 04:21.640
"...but my ass doesn't fit...

04:22.080 --> 04:23.560
in the bathtub."

04:24.120 --> 04:26.560
"#AssTheSizeOfTheCircle."

04:27.000 --> 04:28.880
And mine doesn't fit on the toilet seat!

04:28.960 --> 04:30.920
Circle, message.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.280
What was that yesterday?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.920
So intense. I barely slept.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.520
No, you slept well. It had nothing
to do with you. Renan is so dull.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.160
He's so... pfft!

04:40.240 --> 04:42.320
Circle, type status.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.040
Believe in yourself, believe in goodness.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.960
-Folded hands emoji.
-Folded hands emoji.

04:47.040 --> 04:50.200
#OneDayAtATime. #WakeUpPeople.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.000
I wonder if Luma was...

04:53.560 --> 04:55.000
the superinfluencer.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.320
"The newsfeed has been updated."

04:59.400 --> 05:01.040
Circle, open my newsfeed.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.400
NEWSFEED

05:03.480 --> 05:05.960
It's Lo's message!

05:07.760 --> 05:11.520
I've waited for this moment for so long.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.560
Hi, blondie. I'm taking my sunglasses off
so I can see you better.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.280
Circle, open Lorayne's message.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.880
Calm down...

05:29.360 --> 05:30.720
Hey, everybody.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.160
I'm Lorayne.

05:32.240 --> 05:36.960
The person who didn't tell
any lies in the game!

05:37.040 --> 05:39.280
That's exactly what I thought, sis.

05:39.360 --> 05:42.400
You're wonderful, beautiful,
but kinda... pfft.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.520
<i>Lo's tip: there are some people</i>

05:45.600 --> 05:47.240
thinking that <i>The Circle...</i>

05:48.200 --> 05:49.960
is a puppet show.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.200
Watch out, homewreckers
get knocked down early.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.080
-She's talking about JP and Ray.
-And Ray.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.800
JP must be trembling!

06:00.240 --> 06:02.240
Do you think I wanted you?

06:02.320 --> 06:03.720
Why call me a homewrecker?

06:03.800 --> 06:05.520
Princess, get off your high horse.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.040
Take off your crown
because you're not a big deal.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.440
<i>JP, don't be mad!</i>

06:10.520 --> 06:12.440
<i>That wasn't directed at you.</i>

06:12.520 --> 06:15.320
I have an alliance,
I don't know if you're aware of that.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.920
And my ally was probably
the one who blocked you.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.080
Okay, Lorayne.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.280
Kisses.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.320
Go play with your "puppets."

06:25.400 --> 06:26.520
I'm gonna do yoga.

06:28.440 --> 06:32.480
<i>How to relax when so little is known</i>
<i>about the mysterious blocking?</i>

06:32.560 --> 06:35.440
Let's open a chat. #CardsOnTheTable.

06:35.520 --> 06:40.160
Our best option is to tell them
we were superinfluencers,

06:40.240 --> 06:44.280
so we can avoid all the gossip

06:44.360 --> 06:46.640
that can harm Luma later.

06:46.720 --> 06:49.040
-With everybody?
-With everybody.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.480
Oh, my God!

06:52.560 --> 06:54.040
"Luma has invited you..."

06:54.120 --> 06:56.920
-"...to the #CardsOnTheTable Chat."
-#CardsOnTheTable.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.800
What is that about?

06:58.880 --> 07:01.600
Circle, open the #CardsOnTheTable Chat.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.200
#CARDSONTHETABLE

07:03.280 --> 07:05.360
Why did she add everybody?

07:05.440 --> 07:08.720
Which cards are you laying on the table?

07:08.800 --> 07:10.400
Circle, message.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.920
You guys!

07:12.400 --> 07:14.480
I had to decide who would be blocked.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.840
There's a mix of feelings in my chest.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.880
And for reasons all of you know,
it was Lorayne.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.720
Unfortunately, a silly lie

07:22.800 --> 07:25.280
can make things worse in the game.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.280
Send.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.360
So, Luma was the superinfluencer?

07:31.280 --> 07:33.560
I wanna know what lie she was telling.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.040
At least she's being honest.

07:36.120 --> 07:39.320
She spilled everything
and didn't hold back.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.800
Circle, message.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.400
Luma, we have to remember
we're on the final stretch.

07:44.480 --> 07:48.200
"And a little lie, silly or not,
makes a huge difference in the game."

07:48.280 --> 07:50.920
There. Now you can see

07:51.000 --> 07:54.240
someone who plays in a mature way.

07:54.520 --> 07:55.640
Circle, message.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.440
I noticed Lorayne called me
a homewrecker in her message.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.400
I would like to make it clear...

08:01.960 --> 08:05.320
that I haven't, uppercase letters,
in any moment,

08:05.400 --> 08:08.640
flirted with her or tried to meddle
in her relationship with Akel.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.960
Little does he know he's the manipulator.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.760
He's blind.

08:14.840 --> 08:18.600
Well, if it wasn't meant for JP,
it was meant for me.

08:18.680 --> 08:23.200
I had that talk with Akel before he left.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.600
I'm gonna say something

08:24.680 --> 08:27.480
because I love drama,
and I wanna watch the world burn.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.800
Message.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.960
So, guys, let me clear things up.

08:32.040 --> 08:35.200
"Before Akel left, I talked to him
to get to know him better."

08:35.280 --> 08:37.280
"I asked a lot of questions
about Lorayne."

08:37.360 --> 08:40.080
"He said he really liked her..."

08:40.160 --> 08:42.640
"...but he was willing
to meet more people."

08:42.720 --> 08:46.800
"Akel jumped the gun
when he told her that I hit on him."

08:46.880 --> 08:49.760
"#TheNakedTruth."

08:51.760 --> 08:54.440
The "homewrecker" thing
was directed at Ray.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.680
There. Now everything makes sense.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.440
The truth came to light.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.480
I actually believe in Ray.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.040
Look at that woman.

09:02.120 --> 09:05.200
Do you think she hits on anyone?

09:05.280 --> 09:08.400
But it wasn't quite like that, right?

09:08.480 --> 09:10.080
I talked to him, flirted with him,

09:10.160 --> 09:13.160
tried to make things work,
shipped us as a couple.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.040
Circle, message. Bottom line,

09:16.120 --> 09:18.080
if everything had come to light before,

09:18.160 --> 09:20.560
none of this would have happened. Send.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.040
Wow, Luma. Nice message.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.480
Lorayne, sorry.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.560
Sorry for my hasty thinking.

09:27.640 --> 09:30.120
Now I know I'm not the "homewrecker."

09:32.400 --> 09:35.000
Taking only that chat
into consideration...

09:35.360 --> 09:37.560
-Ray would leave.
-Ray would leave.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.320
Because she was attacked the most.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.680
I think people should be careful with me.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.760
<i>I think you've made this pretty clear.</i>

09:46.560 --> 09:50.200
<i>Moving forward,</i>
<i>if you're not careful, you're out.</i>

09:51.480 --> 09:52.400
Circle...

09:52.760 --> 09:54.280
open chat with Marina.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.800
"JP has invited you to a private chat."

10:02.240 --> 10:04.840
My God. What now?

10:05.320 --> 10:07.960
I think it will be good
to talk to Marina right now,

10:08.760 --> 10:09.920
since...

10:10.000 --> 10:11.760
her best friend is out.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.920
It's a good chance
to clear some things up.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.920
Maybe I can bring her to my side.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.960
Circle, message.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.160
Hello, sassy <i>carioca.</i>

10:23.840 --> 10:27.880
So, how do you feel
about your sis Lorayne leaving?

10:28.600 --> 10:29.720
Circle, send.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.320
Aw, he's being a cutie.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.960
I just hope he doesn't start gossiping,

10:37.040 --> 10:38.960
I hope he's honest.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.680
Circle, message.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.800
Hey. I know you guys had a fight,

10:45.880 --> 10:48.120
and I ended up taking sides.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.320
I had to get that off my chest.

10:50.400 --> 10:55.000
I need to know your opinion
about everything that happened.

10:55.080 --> 10:58.160
Let's be more transparent.
That's all I ask.

10:58.680 --> 10:59.680
Send.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.440
Girl, transparency...

11:05.280 --> 11:07.520
is my first name,
and truth is my last name.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.760
Let's get serious.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.960
Circle, message to Marina.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.160
That #CardsOnTheTable Chat

11:13.240 --> 11:15.520
explained a lot of things I didn't know.

11:15.600 --> 11:19.320
For instance, that situation
with Ray is news to me.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.760
I had no idea.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.040
Maybe they should have had
a serious talk, Lorayne...

11:24.120 --> 11:24.960
"...and Ray."

11:26.040 --> 11:27.920
Exactly.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.200
Circle, message.

11:29.800 --> 11:34.160
Now, I realize I was hasty
about the "homewrecker" thing.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.600
"I even would like to apologize

11:36.680 --> 11:39.120
for the way I judged Lorayne."

11:39.200 --> 11:40.800
Aw, man.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.400
Circle, message.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.640
Dude, that's a relief.

11:45.240 --> 11:48.520
I never thought we would be
so honest with each other.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.200
Shall we keep it this way?

11:50.480 --> 11:52.800
"#LetsGo. #LetsGetThem."

11:53.200 --> 11:54.080
Great.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.400
Yes, I wanna trust JP.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.640
I don't want people trying...

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
to change my mind about him.

12:03.080 --> 12:03.920
Very nice.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.880
Let's go. Let's get them, Marina.

12:06.480 --> 12:07.400
The final stretch.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.280
We'll be in the final, God willing.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.360
<i>Calm down, JP.</i>

12:12.440 --> 12:15.760
<i>There are still a lot of people fighting</i>
<i>for the prize of 300,000 reais.</i>

12:16.160 --> 12:19.920
<i>A lot of stuff can happen</i>
<i>and turn </i>The Circle<i> upside down.</i>

12:22.840 --> 12:24.520
"My biggest rival."

12:24.600 --> 12:26.480
I can name six of them.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.440
"My biggest rival."

12:28.520 --> 12:29.960
Are we going to...

12:30.360 --> 12:31.600
expose each other?

12:33.160 --> 12:35.920
"This is your opportunity to say

12:36.000 --> 12:37.880
why you should win the competition."

12:39.160 --> 12:41.000
"You must name your biggest rival

12:41.080 --> 12:43.400
and explain why you deserve to beat them."

12:45.080 --> 12:46.960
What the hell, Circle?

12:47.240 --> 12:48.320
Do you want a war?

12:48.400 --> 12:52.160
How should I say someone is my rival

12:52.240 --> 12:56.200
without them becoming my rival?

12:57.600 --> 13:00.880
Naming people
from the North Alliance is bad.

13:00.960 --> 13:01.920
-So...
-That leaves...

13:02.000 --> 13:04.120
-Ana...
-Ana, Renan, and Marina.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.240
-What if we say Marina?
-No.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.960
Marina is much more involved
with the other players than Renan.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.280
Circle, message.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.200
My biggest rival is Renan

13:15.280 --> 13:18.760
because in a short amount of time,
he proved to be an honest and fair player.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.680
I deserve to beat him
because he just got in the game

13:21.760 --> 13:24.040
and doesn't know what happened before.

13:24.520 --> 13:25.560
-Hashtag...
-Hashtag...

13:25.640 --> 13:27.360
"#RivalsAreNotEnemies."

13:27.760 --> 13:29.440
I wasn't expecting that.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.200
You're such an ass-kisser, Luma.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.440
My biggest rival is Dumaresq

13:35.520 --> 13:37.080
because he's very charismatic

13:37.480 --> 13:41.280
and easily wins people over.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.000
And I deserve to beat him...

13:43.080 --> 13:46.000
"...because I'll be as great as him,

13:46.080 --> 13:48.720
maybe better."

13:48.800 --> 13:53.000
Look at that! I loved the compliments!

13:54.200 --> 13:55.040
Oof.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.160
It's my turn now.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.600
Who is JP's rival?

13:59.080 --> 14:01.200
Uh, I think it's Luma.

14:01.280 --> 14:04.320
Unless he mentions
someone weak, like Renan.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.480
My biggest rival is Renan

14:06.960 --> 14:09.480
because he was the last contestant
to enter <i>The Circle,</i>

14:09.560 --> 14:11.960
and I still haven't had the chance
to get to know him.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.000
I deserve to beat him

14:13.080 --> 14:16.400
because people already have an opinion
regarding my character,

14:16.480 --> 14:18.200
nature, and personality.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.400
"#NothingAgainstYouBro."

14:22.400 --> 14:25.160
See, I knew it.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.000
I knew it.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.720
He knows it's Luma,
but he mentioned Renan.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.840
My biggest rival

14:33.920 --> 14:35.360
is Ana.

14:35.720 --> 14:38.120
Because her sense of humor

14:38.200 --> 14:40.480
will end up killing me.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.720
And I deserve to beat her

14:42.800 --> 14:46.680
so I can be the only funny person

14:46.760 --> 14:49.000
in <i>The Circle.</i>

14:49.080 --> 14:50.360
Send.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.240
Circle, message.

14:53.320 --> 14:56.120
All you need is a fart joke
to make me laugh my ass off.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.200
#DumaLover.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.560
Send.

15:01.320 --> 15:04.320
Ana, please marry me.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.200
Let's be a couple.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.680
Can you imagine us dating?

15:08.760 --> 15:11.160
<i>I'm already thinking</i>
<i>about the wedding cake.</i>

15:14.880 --> 15:16.560
Luma is my real...

15:16.960 --> 15:17.920
rival.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.600
But I'm not picking a fight with her.
Are you crazy?

15:21.680 --> 15:22.760
Circle, message.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.480
My biggest rival is JP

15:24.560 --> 15:27.280
because he's a good player
and is always focused on the game.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.880
I deserve to beat him...

15:28.960 --> 15:32.160
"...because I can show
that a Brazilian woman's charisma

15:32.240 --> 15:35.000
is stronger,
and I am living proof of that."

15:38.920 --> 15:41.400
My biggest rival is JP.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.640
As if.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.120
Circle, message.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.120
My grandma Ivete Gadelha taught me

15:48.200 --> 15:52.160
to respect people,
regardless of gender, skin color,

15:52.240 --> 15:56.000
sexual orientation,
social class, <i>et cetera...</i>

15:56.600 --> 15:59.400
Brazilian women
are very charismatic, no doubt.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.840
You are living proof of that.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.720
#Personality.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.320
Circle, send.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.000
-Whoa, JP!
-Wow.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.240
What he said...

16:11.760 --> 16:13.360
in this answer...

16:13.440 --> 16:14.680
subdued Ana.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.600
I think JP really...

16:16.680 --> 16:18.880
He respects people.

16:18.960 --> 16:22.280
He has always been respectful
and friendly towards me.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.760
I think Dumaresq
is one of my biggest rivals.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.280
But now, more than ever,

16:30.840 --> 16:31.680
it's Luma.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.160
She's not being assertive.

16:36.240 --> 16:39.280
She's being too vague.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.000
She's kind of scared

16:41.080 --> 16:43.760
of throwing shade and losing friends.

16:44.280 --> 16:45.880
Circle, message.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.520
My biggest rival is...

16:49.480 --> 16:50.440
Luma.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.600
Because...

16:51.880 --> 16:55.160
she has been gaining momentum in the game,

16:55.560 --> 16:57.320
and I admire that.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.800
I deserve to beat her

17:02.880 --> 17:05.480
because I don't think
she's as straightforward

17:06.040 --> 17:07.360
as me.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.440
She lacks assertiveness.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.040
#JustAHint.

17:16.520 --> 17:17.520
Send.

17:19.320 --> 17:21.200
Marina is taking a dig at us.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.640
-Throwing shade.
-She thinks...

17:22.720 --> 17:25.520
She'll start saying
that Luma is on the fence.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.160
Luma is never on the fence.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.240
But if she wants us

17:29.320 --> 17:31.080
to be assertive, then just wait.

17:31.160 --> 17:33.880
I hope she doesn't think...

17:34.280 --> 17:37.440
I'm mad at her because she blocked...

17:37.880 --> 17:39.880
Lorayne. It's not that.

17:40.440 --> 17:43.680
I think Marina feels threatened by Luma.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.480
I'm so proud. Marina, look...

17:46.480 --> 17:48.560
I'm so proud of you, girl.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.000
Great, she's picking a fight
with the popular player.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.480
My biggest rival is Marina.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.240
Since she'll know I said that...

17:58.080 --> 18:01.920
I'm gonna change my strategy
and mention someone else.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.840
I'm gonna attack JP.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.480
<i>Huh? What about</i>
<i>the North-Northeast Alliance?</i>

18:06.960 --> 18:08.680
Circle, message.

18:09.160 --> 18:12.640
My biggest rival is JP

18:12.720 --> 18:14.160
because he's a great player.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.760
And I deserve to beat him
because I have better strategies.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.200
That's it. Send.

18:20.840 --> 18:25.240
They cannot know I'm the apple
from <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs!</i>

18:25.800 --> 18:29.840
That I'm pretty on the outside,
and poisonous on the inside.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.880
That's a surprise.

18:33.960 --> 18:36.440
She's proving herself
to be very strategic, right?

18:36.960 --> 18:38.440
She's not stupid at all.

18:38.520 --> 18:41.800
For instance, she flirted with Akel,

18:41.880 --> 18:43.840
tried to seduce people and such.

18:43.920 --> 18:47.280
In other words, she's not as innocent
as she seems to be.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.600
Circle, message.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
I thought you were my ally.

18:51.080 --> 18:54.520
May the best player win,
and may the strategies always be ethical.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.320
#GoodNature.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.240
#GoodLuck.

18:58.840 --> 18:59.680
Send.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.840
Look, he's taking a dig at her.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.720
JP is playing dirty

19:05.800 --> 19:08.840
because he's always saying
self-affirming stuff, like,

19:08.920 --> 19:12.160
"May the best player win,
and may the strategies always be ethical."

19:14.840 --> 19:17.760
Now, Marina wants us to be assertive.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.080
Marina!

19:19.160 --> 19:20.080
Guys, hello?

19:20.720 --> 19:24.280
Wake up. That was an opportunity
for everybody to express themselves,

19:24.360 --> 19:25.480
and nobody did.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.720
What I took from this game is...

19:28.120 --> 19:30.160
you are all two-faced.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.520
<i>Two-faced status: updated.</i>

19:36.560 --> 19:39.200
<i>This game is full of "Wow's" and "Whoa's."</i>

19:39.280 --> 19:40.760
<i>Plot twists all over the place.</i>

19:52.360 --> 19:54.520
I feel like I should talk to Luma.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.800
I don't know if she understood

19:58.480 --> 20:00.240
what I really meant.

20:00.320 --> 20:04.160
Circle, open private chat with Luma.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.440
MARINA HAS INVITED YOU

20:06.520 --> 20:08.040
Speak of the devil!

20:08.440 --> 20:10.080
Circle, open chat.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.720

20:16.760 --> 20:20.080
Luma, I hope you're not upset

20:20.160 --> 20:21.480
with what I said.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.960
Before the #CardsOnTheTable Chat,

20:24.040 --> 20:28.320
I thought you were a bit distant,

20:37.960 --> 20:39.480
-That's terrible.
-No!

20:39.560 --> 20:40.440
Marina.

-Hey Marina!

20:42.520 --> 20:44.680
-Hey, colon...
-No. Heyyy.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.400
Heyyy Marina. Very girly...

20:48.720 --> 20:51.000
If Luma is straightforward,

20:51.080 --> 20:52.320
like she claims to be,

20:52.720 --> 20:57.480
she'll completely understand
my point of view.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.640
Circle, message. Heyyy Marina.

21:00.040 --> 21:03.720
Of course, I'm not upset.
I respect your opinion.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.120
I even would like to ask you,

21:06.200 --> 21:09.280
what do you really mean
with your point of view,

21:09.360 --> 21:12.800
and what do you mean by, quote,
"straightforward?" Question mark.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.800
You were the first person
I talked to in chat.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.280
"And I liked you right away."

21:18.640 --> 21:19.880
That's great to hear.

21:20.960 --> 21:24.080
From this talk, I think...

21:24.160 --> 21:25.800
Marina will figure out who Luma is.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.920
But let's see where this is going.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.440
Circle, message.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.920
I'm glad to hear that.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.120
About being "straightforward,"
a good example of that

21:38.200 --> 21:40.640
happened in the game, quote,

21:40.720 --> 21:43.560
"My Biggest Rival," unquote.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.720
"Luma, in spite of that,
I truly admire you for creating

21:47.280 --> 21:48.480
the #CardsOnTheTable Chat.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.880
And I came with an open heart to tell you

21:51.640 --> 21:53.000
what I was feeling."

21:53.080 --> 21:54.960
Marina grabbed a white flag

21:55.040 --> 21:57.520

21:57.600 --> 21:58.960
She dropped her guard.

Okay, Luma.

I was a little upset
about Lorayne's situation,

If some lie

22:31.120 --> 22:33.000
ended up making Luma...

22:34.280 --> 22:35.640
block Lorayne,

22:36.040 --> 22:38.200
what about Ray's situation?

22:38.280 --> 22:39.920
She had guts.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.640
She had guts. She <i>has</i> guts.

Circle, message.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.240
About that...

22:44.760 --> 22:46.760
-I still...
-I told... Wait.

22:46.840 --> 22:50.080
I told Lorayne
that she should have talked earlier

22:50.400 --> 22:51.400
to Ray.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.360
Things wouldn't be so messy.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.960
As for her explanation,
I would have defended myself better.

22:57.040 --> 22:57.880
Send.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.000
Christ Almighty.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.840
Wow!

23:04.320 --> 23:06.600
Marina wants to put Luma against the wall.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.880
Poor thing. Little does Marina know,

23:09.960 --> 23:11.720
she's the one on Luma's wall.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.440
Oof.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.680
#FRIENDSWITHEVERYBODY
#WATCHOUT

23:16.760 --> 23:19.360
Dude, I smelled a rat

23:19.440 --> 23:21.360
after reading Ray's explanation.

23:22.080 --> 23:25.120
She definitely
could've defended herself better.

23:25.640 --> 23:27.520
I already know what I'm gonna say.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.760
Circle, message.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.000
Exactly! Exclamation mark.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.120
Now you're talking.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.880
But anyway, Luma,

23:34.960 --> 23:37.880
I'm glad I talked to you.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.760
If you need anything, I'm here for you.

23:39.840 --> 23:42.600

23:42.680 --> 23:46.480

You have no idea how great I feel

23:46.560 --> 23:48.320
after a talk like this.

23:48.400 --> 23:51.440
"#RoadToTheFinal. #LetsGoToTheBeach."

23:54.400 --> 23:56.680
I love it.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.120
All she said was true.

23:58.200 --> 24:01.360
We could see that Marina is a bit insane.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.440
In the #CardsOnTheTable Chat...

24:03.840 --> 24:07.920
she told her opinions about Ray,
and Luma thought it was weird.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.360
All I know is that Ray...

24:10.920 --> 24:13.600
#IsATarget.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.400
<i>Survival mode: activated.</i>

Look who showed up!

24:35.200 --> 24:38.280
"Dumaresq has invited you
to a private chat."

24:38.360 --> 24:39.920
Let's talk, Master Duma.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.240
PRIVATE CHAT

24:42.320 --> 24:43.880
I was wondering if...

24:43.960 --> 24:46.800
I had unfinished business with someone.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.320
That someone is JP.

24:48.400 --> 24:52.640
And I really want us
to become even closer friends,

24:52.720 --> 24:54.600
friends who care about each other.

24:54.680 --> 24:55.760

24:55.840 --> 24:58.040
Good evening, #MasterDuma.

24:58.120 --> 25:01.080
I swear I was here working out,
thinking...

25:01.320 --> 25:02.800
about us in the final.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.440
When I looked at the screen,

25:04.520 --> 25:06.960
what a great surprise,
you invited me to a chat.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.000
Circle, send.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.960
Whoa!

25:11.240 --> 25:13.600
Circle, message.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.480
I've always wanted to tell you something.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.000
Knowing that I would hang out

25:19.080 --> 25:22.880
with people from different backgrounds
and mindsets,

25:23.320 --> 25:25.680
when I first saw you, I thought,

25:25.760 --> 25:30.120
"This is an oppressive military man."

25:30.200 --> 25:31.080
Send.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.520
Unfortunately, that is...

25:36.600 --> 25:39.240
the impression...

25:39.320 --> 25:41.480
that we, from the military,

25:41.880 --> 25:43.480
give to society.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.320
And it's the opposite. I am...

25:45.600 --> 25:46.920
completely...

25:47.000 --> 25:48.200
the opposite of that.

25:48.280 --> 25:51.360
Everybody is free
to be whatever they want to be.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.800
Circle, message.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.160
I get it.

25:54.240 --> 25:57.600
I feared such a reaction
after revealing my occupation.

25:57.680 --> 26:00.560
I think people are free
to be whatever they want

26:00.640 --> 26:03.040
and express themselves
in a way that makes them happy.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.120

26:07.480 --> 26:10.000
That's right, JP!

26:10.080 --> 26:12.040

26:12.120 --> 26:16.080
You turned out to be an open-minded guy

26:16.160 --> 26:18.280
with a giant heart.

26:18.360 --> 26:21.960
Joining positive forces is fundamental

26:22.040 --> 26:23.840
to society.

26:23.920 --> 26:24.960
Send.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.480

26:29.400 --> 26:30.280

26:34.560 --> 26:37.960
Bro, I'm so glad
that you got what I meant.

26:38.040 --> 26:41.520
I felt your honesty
and your positivity from here.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.640
I've got chills. I'm not kidding.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.720
We'll be together in the final.
#NortheastAlliance.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.080
"#GoodVibes!"

26:51.160 --> 26:53.600

27:01.760 --> 27:04.800
As for the final, mentalize it from there,

27:06.600 --> 27:09.000
#NortheastAlliance.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.480
Send it, Circle.

27:12.440 --> 27:13.320
Bro,

27:13.400 --> 27:15.720
if either you or I win, I'll be happy.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.400
Wow, I'm so happy

27:17.680 --> 27:20.280
with that talk, JP!

27:20.560 --> 27:21.640
I love it!

27:21.720 --> 27:23.200
After that talk,

27:23.880 --> 27:26.480
he's on the top of my ranking.

27:26.560 --> 27:27.720
He's first place now.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.360
#THEHOMEWRECKERS

27:39.440 --> 27:40.880
ALERT!

27:40.960 --> 27:42.680
-Alert!
-Alert!

27:42.760 --> 27:44.840
Whoa there! Speak of the devil...

27:45.960 --> 27:47.400
I've just finished my workout.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.840
"It's time for the ratings."

27:51.480 --> 27:53.840
Guys, I'm not ready for that.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.080
I'm not ready...

27:56.720 --> 27:58.880
for another rating so soon.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.800
"Rank the players from favorite...

28:02.400 --> 28:03.760
to least favorite."

28:03.840 --> 28:05.960
"The top two players

28:06.040 --> 28:07.560
will become influencers..."

28:07.640 --> 28:09.240
"...and will hold great power."

28:09.320 --> 28:12.800
And now the newbie has no privileges.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.560
Everybody will be rated.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.640
I hope everybody liked me,

28:18.720 --> 28:21.640
I'm not a threat to anybody,
and I hope they give me good rates.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.680
My poor crown...

28:25.920 --> 28:27.800
It doesn't know what this is anymore.

28:31.480 --> 28:33.000
We'll probably see something new.

28:33.640 --> 28:34.560
Right?

28:35.400 --> 28:37.080
Right, dad.

28:37.160 --> 28:40.000
-"The top two players..."
-You're already getting nervous.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.640
There's no way to avoid it

28:41.720 --> 28:43.400
-because it's...
-You're stressed out.

28:43.480 --> 28:44.440
I'm not stressed out.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.680
I made it very clear...

28:53.760 --> 28:55.520
that she's my target.

28:55.600 --> 28:56.640
Sixth place,

28:57.120 --> 28:57.960
Marina.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.040
In third,

29:01.120 --> 29:04.280
I'm gonna place my sassy <i>carioca.</i>

29:04.360 --> 29:06.840
I'm having an opportunity
to get to know her better.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.200
Third place goes to Marina.

29:09.800 --> 29:13.640
-Correct.
-In first, I wanna place JP.

29:13.720 --> 29:16.880
I had important conversations with JP.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.760
He had the guts to say
some things in group chats,

29:20.440 --> 29:23.040
and no one was doing that before.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.280
In fourth, I'm gonna put JP.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.400
I think JP is the strongest player.

29:29.480 --> 29:32.920
But I'm not sure if he'll save me
if he becomes an influencer.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.520
In third place, I'm gonna put Ana.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.600
Because of her level

29:37.680 --> 29:39.600
of danger.

29:39.680 --> 29:43.920
At this moment,
I think Ana can be dangerous, right?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.560
Circle, Ray in sixth place.

29:46.640 --> 29:49.000
The fact that you admitted

29:49.080 --> 29:51.880
in the #CardsOnTheTable Chat

29:51.960 --> 29:53.800
that you talked to Akel...

29:53.880 --> 29:57.640
You had your chance to explain yourself,

29:57.720 --> 30:01.840
but you dodged the subject and got angry.

30:01.920 --> 30:03.320
There was no need for that.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.560
In second, Ray.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.120
Since Luma saved Ray

30:08.200 --> 30:10.640
right before the final blocking,

30:10.720 --> 30:13.480
she holds Luma in high regard.

30:13.560 --> 30:17.640
And if Ray was to take someone out,
she would block another person.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.960
-Yeah.
-Starts with "Ma," ends with "Rina."

30:20.040 --> 30:22.760
In sixth place, of course it's Luma.

30:22.840 --> 30:25.280
I don't get what these people want.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.680
Picking Luma as an influencer

30:27.760 --> 30:30.160
just shows that they want her
to win the game.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.040
I want to devour Luma,

30:32.120 --> 30:34.840
just like you do it
with a piece of toast in the morning.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.560
No butter, by the way.
I want to swallow it,

30:37.640 --> 30:39.080
pretend that Luma didn't exist.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.200
In first, I'm gonna place Luma.

30:41.280 --> 30:44.120
I believe she'll make a good judgment
if she receives

30:44.200 --> 30:47.360
that superpower again
to decide who should leave.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.840
In sixth place,

30:49.720 --> 30:52.080
I wanna put Renan.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.960
He hasn't shown yet

30:54.040 --> 30:55.720
his whole personality.

30:55.800 --> 30:59.040
I want you to expose yourself
the same way you expose your chest

30:59.120 --> 31:00.040
to me.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.840
Circle. In second place, Dumaresq.

31:03.400 --> 31:05.880
I want to believe Dumaresq would save me.

31:05.960 --> 31:08.480
I've always trusted him, so...

31:09.440 --> 31:11.640
it's fair to put him in second.

31:11.720 --> 31:12.840
-Circle.
-Circle.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.720
-Send my ratings.
-Send the ratings.

31:15.800 --> 31:20.240
RATINGS COMPLETE

31:21.840 --> 31:23.760

31:23.840 --> 31:26.040
<i>Friends became enemies.</i>

31:26.120 --> 31:27.920
<i>I don't know what to expect anymore.</i>

31:29.080 --> 31:31.240
Oh, I can name the group chat.

31:31.760 --> 31:32.600
"Women..."

31:33.520 --> 31:34.400
Circle.

31:34.480 --> 31:39.480
Open a private chat
called "Women are Great"

31:39.560 --> 31:41.800

31:42.920 --> 31:45.560
Whoa. Wait a sec, or I'll burn the rice.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.600
Ana has invited me to a chat.

31:47.680 --> 31:51.800
Circle, open the Women are Great Chat.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.040
She added only the dudes.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.720
Naughty.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.160

31:58.240 --> 32:00.320

32:00.400 --> 32:01.400
Circle, message.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.920
Hey, guys. Since I go both always,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.440
I thought it'd be nice to talk to you.

32:06.520 --> 32:07.480
LOL.

Whoa there, thirsty Ana!

32:16.680 --> 32:17.560
Send.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.080
I don't get what she wants, but...

32:21.080 --> 32:23.360
she's messaging right now.
Let's see what she says.

32:23.880 --> 32:25.000
Circle, message.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.280
Obviously, I've opened this chat
to talk about the girls...

32:28.360 --> 32:29.920
Ellipsis. Renan...

32:30.200 --> 32:33.000
"Now that Lorayne left,
are you interested in another person?"

32:36.120 --> 32:37.640
Actually, she wants...

32:38.160 --> 32:39.320
to find out...

32:40.080 --> 32:43.560
if there are any alliances
being formed through couples.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.240
I think that's her intention.

32:45.320 --> 32:46.840
They'll also see me

32:47.360 --> 32:48.400
as part of the gang.

32:48.480 --> 32:51.600
So, in the end, I'm in the girls' chat

32:51.680 --> 32:53.560
and in the boys' chat.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.320
Take that, Dumaresq.

33:00.640 --> 33:01.960
Well, obviously,

33:02.760 --> 33:04.320
but I'm still testing the waters.

33:04.520 --> 33:07.200
Ray and Luma are really interesting.
What do you guys think?

33:08.800 --> 33:10.600
"Ray and Luma are really interesting.

33:10.680 --> 33:11.800

33:15.320 --> 33:18.160
Renan, you bastard. LOL.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.520
Ray and Luma are mine.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.240
Get your eyes off them, you dog.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.480
Laugh emoji with tears.

33:24.880 --> 33:25.720
Send.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.160

33:28.640 --> 33:30.160
Get your eyes off them, you dog."

33:33.240 --> 33:34.560
What if I make some intrigue?

33:34.640 --> 33:37.760
What if I say something
to make him suspect her?

33:37.840 --> 33:40.600
That player might be Luma's mother.

33:41.040 --> 33:43.800
That woman who showed up in her photo.

33:43.880 --> 33:46.120
Yes. I can say something like that.

33:46.200 --> 33:47.560
Circle, message.

33:47.760 --> 33:51.920
They both are truly beautiful, comma,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.360
but something came to mind today, colon...

33:54.440 --> 33:56.520
"What if Luma is, in fact,

33:56.600 --> 33:57.840
her mother?

33:59.240 --> 34:01.200
I have to say, I'd hit on her mom, too.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.600
#LikeMotherLikeDaughter."

34:05.680 --> 34:08.760
I would hit on no one!
You know what I would hit? Your faces.

34:11.240 --> 34:13.560
I hadn't thought about that. Like...

34:13.640 --> 34:15.480
She posted...

34:16.360 --> 34:17.800
a photo with her mother.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.360
So, we were left

34:19.440 --> 34:21.600
with the idea
that Luma might be a catfish.

34:22.640 --> 34:25.720
I've been wanting to say something
about Luma for a while.

34:25.800 --> 34:26.800
Circle, message.

34:27.160 --> 34:29.520
Really, Ana? I hadn't thought about that.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.880
Is it just a hunch,

34:32.320 --> 34:33.840
or do you have a clue?

34:34.400 --> 34:35.560
Circle, send.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.920
I wouldn't say it's her mother, but...

34:39.000 --> 34:41.680
I have my suspicions
that Luma isn't, in fact, Luma.

34:42.160 --> 34:43.440
Circle, message.

34:43.920 --> 34:46.560
Ana, I don't know if that's her mother.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.920
I only know that I like her a lot.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.160
Smile emoji with heart-shaped eyes.

34:51.240 --> 34:52.440
Circle, message.

34:53.440 --> 34:56.920
Now I have to pretend
that I'm not bad-mouthing people.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.080
Now I have to be like,

34:59.160 --> 35:00.720
"Nah, it's just my imagination.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.920
But that doesn't make any difference.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.160
I love Luma!"

35:05.960 --> 35:07.680
"She's so nice to me."

35:07.760 --> 35:10.560
Yikes, you're trying to cover your ass.

35:11.160 --> 35:12.600
Luma is too popular.

35:12.680 --> 35:15.240
I can't let that girlie...

35:15.480 --> 35:16.640
be popular.

35:16.720 --> 35:18.720
I'm gonna destroy Luma.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.040
Circle, message.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.800
It was great talking to you guys.
See you, Ana.

35:23.880 --> 35:24.840
See you, JP.

35:25.600 --> 35:28.760
Smile emoji. High-five emoji.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.440
"It was great talking to you guys.

35:30.680 --> 35:32.120
See you, Ana. See you, JP."

35:32.200 --> 35:33.120
He's cool.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.040
Nice guy. He can count on me.

35:35.120 --> 35:36.240
Thanks!

35:36.680 --> 35:38.040
Close this shit.

35:40.880 --> 35:43.120
<i>Yeah, Ana. After that talk,</i>

35:43.200 --> 35:45.320
<i>will you be a loser or a winner?"</i>

35:48.160 --> 35:49.800
ALERT!

35:49.880 --> 35:51.680
-Whoa!
-Alert.

35:51.760 --> 35:55.120
This is so stressful, you guys.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.200
Oh, my God...

35:57.280 --> 35:58.920
Oof, it's time.

35:59.000 --> 35:59.840
Let's go, Congão.

36:02.200 --> 36:03.400
We have the results.

36:03.480 --> 36:05.920
Oh, God. I'm afraid to look.

36:06.000 --> 36:06.960
So nerve-wracking.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.040
Seventh place.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.960
Please, it's okay if I'm sixth,
but I can't be seventh.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.560
This is so stressful, you guys.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.040
No, God!

36:26.840 --> 36:29.520
With Ray in seventh place,

36:30.400 --> 36:33.360
it's now quite clear

36:33.600 --> 36:35.240
that we're playing her.

36:37.840 --> 36:39.400
That's a score for me.

36:40.720 --> 36:43.480
God, I can't believe it!

36:48.120 --> 36:50.080
Marina must be in sixth place.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.000
What if Marina is in sixth?

36:52.080 --> 36:54.040
<i>Marina</i>

36:59.000 --> 37:00.720
This has a pro and a con.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.800
I'm not a threat,
don't worry about me, I'm cool.

37:03.880 --> 37:06.480
But I'm not pleasing anyone either.
What's going on?

37:06.560 --> 37:09.280
He's a tiny fish swimming
against the stream.

37:10.040 --> 37:12.360
And the rest of them are sharks,
they're all like...

37:15.200 --> 37:17.320
In fifth place, I'd say JP.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.360
Is it our time?

37:18.440 --> 37:20.880
It will be JP. It <i>is</i> JP.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.520
No, it's Marina.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.760
No way. If I'm in fifth place,
I'm not gonna be happy.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.880
Wow, I need to sit down.

37:31.960 --> 37:35.720
I think this placement shows
how much Marina has changed.

37:35.800 --> 37:39.200
I can't believe you guys
did this to me, man.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.080
Fourth place.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.600
I'm not excited.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.120
It has to be Ana.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.000
I think Marina knows I'm no good.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.120
Let's go. Fourth place is good.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.280
It's in God's hands.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.920
It will be JP.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.040
Is it JP?

38:03.360 --> 38:04.320
It's me.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.960
Are you kidding me?

38:06.040 --> 38:09.440
What did Ana do that I didn't?
She just cracks jokes.

38:11.480 --> 38:13.080
Luma is top three.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.800
Yes!

38:14.880 --> 38:17.280
I'm going up in the ranking!

38:17.920 --> 38:20.480
<i>Three princes and two crowns.</i>

38:20.560 --> 38:22.600
<i>Who will reign in the Blue Room this time?</i>

38:24.400 --> 38:27.000
If it's either Duma or Luma, I'm safe.

38:27.640 --> 38:30.120
If they're at the top,
they won't leave me hanging.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.800
Oh, God...

38:34.720 --> 38:36.680
Here comes my big scowl.

38:38.160 --> 38:39.760
Oh, my God!

38:40.760 --> 38:42.000
We're influencers!

38:42.080 --> 38:44.760
-Conga, let's celebrate!
-Influencer!

38:45.480 --> 38:47.440
Shit! No!

38:49.160 --> 38:54.440
This feeling is so great!

38:55.480 --> 38:57.680
But the top two are Dumaresq

38:57.760 --> 39:00.000
and JP, right?

39:00.400 --> 39:02.400
If they're not a bunch of phonies...

39:05.040 --> 39:07.040
JP in first place, Dumaresq in second.

39:12.040 --> 39:14.000
Yeah!

39:15.920 --> 39:18.400
Oh, my God!

39:18.480 --> 39:22.120
Guys, I'm in first place!

39:22.200 --> 39:25.680
Second place. We are influencers.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.040
We have a responsibility.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.720
Face of an influencer,
pose of an influencer,

39:30.400 --> 39:31.960
presence of an influencer.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.960
Maybe next time, Marina.

39:40.040 --> 39:42.560
This is how a cow feels
when it goes to the slaughter.

39:42.640 --> 39:46.080
Life's not easy for at-risk players.
That's the price for not being popular.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.840
ALERT!

39:48.920 --> 39:51.560
Alert!

39:51.640 --> 39:52.920
Is it time?

39:53.880 --> 39:57.240
Is it time to pack my bags
and go back home?

39:59.880 --> 40:01.200
"Dumaresq and JP,

40:01.640 --> 40:04.160
please go to the Blue Room
to make your decision."

40:05.080 --> 40:07.480
Oh, they're still going?
I have time to eat.

40:10.800 --> 40:11.880
I'm at risk.

40:12.920 --> 40:14.960
But I won't be blocked.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.720
<i>I'm at risk</i>

40:16.800 --> 40:18.200
<i>But I won't be blocked</i>

40:20.440 --> 40:21.600
Master Duma,

40:21.680 --> 40:23.160
we freaking rock.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.880
Northeasterners will rule the world.

40:26.960 --> 40:29.480
Will Dumaresq save me?

40:30.680 --> 40:34.760
Since JP plays the game well,
anybody can be blocked.

40:34.840 --> 40:35.800
I mean...

40:37.000 --> 40:39.520
Except Ray, right? They're in cahoots.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.840
I'll assume this responsibility.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.520
May this decision be fair and correct.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.000
Let's go, Dumaresq. Once again,

40:52.080 --> 40:55.240
let's go to that room you love so much

40:55.320 --> 40:57.880
and decide who to block.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.640
I admit...

41:20.400 --> 41:22.040
I've missed this place.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.920
Let's talk, JP.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.680
From now on, we're starting to define

41:29.440 --> 41:31.360
the potential finalists.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.640
Whoever plays better wins.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.040
No one here would make me say,

41:38.120 --> 41:43.160
"Wow, I'll happily block this person."

41:43.240 --> 41:46.400
Maybe it's time to start blocking

41:46.480 --> 41:48.480
the strongest players.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.080
ALERT!

41:52.000 --> 41:53.360
-Alert.
-Oof.

41:54.280 --> 41:55.640
It's time.

41:55.720 --> 41:57.720
Have they decided yet?

41:58.480 --> 42:01.720
"The influencers Dumaresq and JP

42:01.800 --> 42:03.560
are in the Blue Room..."

42:03.640 --> 42:06.480
"...but they can't discuss
who they'll block."

42:09.080 --> 42:10.200
-What?
-What do you mean?

42:10.280 --> 42:12.680
-But if they can't discuss...
-"They can't discuss..."

42:13.680 --> 42:15.160
...how will they block someone?

42:16.520 --> 42:19.200
"Each influencer will save a player

42:19.680 --> 42:21.720
until there's only one left!"

42:27.440 --> 42:28.920
Sudden death?

42:29.000 --> 42:31.120
Saving a player
until there's only one left.

42:32.920 --> 42:36.480
"All players must go to the Circle Chat."

42:36.560 --> 42:38.560
This means...

42:39.520 --> 42:41.920
we'll be saving players

42:42.480 --> 42:44.000
in front of them.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.120
Circle,

42:53.040 --> 42:54.280
open chat.

42:58.080 --> 43:00.080
CIRCLE CHAT

43:00.160 --> 43:01.160
It's public!

43:01.840 --> 43:04.200
There's nothing they can hide,
nothing they can do.

43:05.440 --> 43:06.600
"Dumaresq,

43:06.680 --> 43:09.440
since you're first in the ratings..."

43:09.520 --> 43:11.760
"...you start by saving a player."

43:12.800 --> 43:14.680
That's what I wanted.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.560
Save me already, so I can go to bed.

43:17.640 --> 43:19.040
Circle, message.

43:19.120 --> 43:21.480
Besides having fun in the game,

43:21.560 --> 43:24.120
you have to see <i>The Circle...</i>

43:24.200 --> 43:25.800
"...as an experience."

43:25.880 --> 43:29.440
"Taking things lightly
and being unique..."

43:29.520 --> 43:31.720
"...make this experience
even more special."

43:32.640 --> 43:34.240
What does he mean?

43:37.920 --> 43:39.960
I'm not light at all.

43:40.040 --> 43:41.640
He'll save Ana.

43:41.720 --> 43:42.760
He'll save me.

43:42.840 --> 43:44.480
I think he'll save Marina.

43:44.560 --> 43:45.800
Circle, message.

43:47.480 --> 43:50.160
The person I'm saving is...

43:50.640 --> 43:51.600
Send.

43:52.480 --> 43:54.000
Ellipsis.

43:54.080 --> 43:55.080
It's Ana.

43:55.160 --> 43:57.600
If it's Ana, I don't understand
anything anymore.

44:03.920 --> 44:07.200
Yeah!

44:07.280 --> 44:08.200
Ana?

44:09.240 --> 44:10.080
Wow.

44:10.160 --> 44:11.240
I knew it.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.200
He said, "Taking things lightly."

44:14.280 --> 44:16.320
He even gave me moral support.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.320
Ana is probably full of herself right now.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.160
"JP,

44:22.840 --> 44:25.000
pick the player you want to save."

44:25.080 --> 44:26.440
Circle, message.

44:26.880 --> 44:27.960
This is a tense moment,

44:28.400 --> 44:30.480
but I'll try to be as fair as possible.

44:30.560 --> 44:33.160
"This person values the truth..."

44:33.240 --> 44:35.800
"...honesty and transparency,
just like I do."

44:35.880 --> 44:39.840
"I want to take our friendship
beyond these screens."

44:41.160 --> 44:42.040
It's me!

44:44.680 --> 44:47.440
-"The person I'm saving is..."
-"The person I'm saving is..."

44:47.520 --> 44:49.200
It's me, girl!

44:49.880 --> 44:51.360
Say it, JP!

44:51.440 --> 44:52.440
Luma.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.520
Luma, baby.

45:01.600 --> 45:04.400
You live in my heart,
and you don't have to pay any rent.

45:04.840 --> 45:07.160
His heart is like a catwalk, right?

45:07.240 --> 45:09.600
There's always a beautiful woman there.

45:09.680 --> 45:11.280
I'm delusional.

Circle, message.

45:17.400 --> 45:21.360
This person has changed
during the journey in <i>The Circle.</i>

"Her glow and energy dimmed..."

45:23.800 --> 45:27.520
"...but I know how valuable it is
for her to be here.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.120
So, start over..."

45:29.560 --> 45:31.320
"...and experience this intensely.

45:31.560 --> 45:33.400
You get another chance."

45:34.360 --> 45:35.320
It's Ray.

45:36.160 --> 45:38.800
God, I don't know if it's me.

45:38.880 --> 45:40.480
Circle, message.

45:40.560 --> 45:43.680
The person I'm saving is...

45:57.200 --> 45:58.720
I can't even celebrate.

45:59.800 --> 46:03.280
Who could possibly celebrate
with such an explanation?

46:04.200 --> 46:05.920
I'm so mad, dude.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.600
"You get another chance."

46:08.280 --> 46:10.600
-The power has gone to his head.
-Duma.

46:10.680 --> 46:13.000
-Tone it down.
-Tone it way down.

46:13.320 --> 46:16.880
I didn't do anything to you.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.440
I've always put you in first place.

46:22.160 --> 46:24.880
Now it's between Renan and me.

46:26.120 --> 46:28.320
Ray and Renan now...

46:28.760 --> 46:30.640
are part of the loser team.

46:31.120 --> 46:34.960
JP is in a tight corner.

46:35.040 --> 46:37.040
Is he saving his bro...

46:38.120 --> 46:40.120
or his lover?

46:43.880 --> 46:45.640
Circle, message.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.560
Judging someone is not an easy task.

46:48.200 --> 46:49.360
We're human beings,

46:50.240 --> 46:52.560
we're dealing with dreams and feelings.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.240
"This person has a lot of grit..."

46:55.320 --> 46:57.720
"...perseverance, and willpower."

47:00.520 --> 47:02.040
As a vote of confidence,

47:02.560 --> 47:04.400
the person I'm saving is...

47:05.040 --> 47:05.880
Send.

47:08.480 --> 47:10.960
"As a vote of confidence,
the person I'm saving is..."

47:11.040 --> 47:12.000
-Ray.
-Renan.

47:12.560 --> 47:13.400
Renan?

47:16.120 --> 47:19.040
He had an alliance.
An alliance isn't a vote of confidence.

47:21.800 --> 47:23.040
Vote of confidence?

47:25.560 --> 47:26.600
I don't wanna look.

47:32.520 --> 47:34.040
Ray. Send.

47:37.320 --> 47:39.640
Oh, my God! I'm gonna die!

47:41.440 --> 47:44.320
Wait, I gotta live
to experience this moment.

47:46.040 --> 47:47.200
I didn't have a chance.

47:47.760 --> 47:49.640
"Renan has been blocked from <i>The Circle."</i>

47:52.400 --> 47:56.080
JP, come over!
I want to kiss your lips right now!

47:56.760 --> 47:58.520
Is he into me?

47:59.480 --> 48:00.840
Being the last player to join

48:00.920 --> 48:04.360
seemed like a good thing
because we're closer to the end, but...

48:04.440 --> 48:08.080
the alliances are the bad thing.
You don't have one.

48:09.440 --> 48:11.120
RENAN HAS BEEN BLOCKED
FROM <i>THE CIRCLE</i>

48:13.840 --> 48:16.600
Wow. You're so aggressive, <i>The Circle.</i>

48:16.680 --> 48:18.200
Take it easy on him.

48:19.040 --> 48:20.240
Luma...

48:21.280 --> 48:22.480
is on good terms...

48:23.440 --> 48:24.280
with Duma.

48:24.920 --> 48:27.840
As well as Ray and JP.

48:27.920 --> 48:31.040
Duma is in both groups.

48:31.120 --> 48:32.280
Marina...

48:32.480 --> 48:35.480
is neutral with Luma, doesn't like Ray.

48:35.800 --> 48:38.600
She's friendly with JP, kinda.

48:39.040 --> 48:40.480
-Ana...
-Nobody knows.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.960
Ana only loves Dumaresq.

48:43.240 --> 48:45.040
No, Ana is a mystery.

48:45.520 --> 48:46.800
We don't know yet.

48:46.880 --> 48:48.360
She Fights...

48:49.280 --> 48:50.960
became Fight for Yourself.

48:53.800 --> 48:56.040
ALERT!

48:56.120 --> 48:57.120
Alert.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.720
It's <i>that</i> kind of alert.

49:01.120 --> 49:02.960
"Renan was blocked from <i>The Circle."</i>

49:03.280 --> 49:04.640
Yeah, Renan.

49:04.720 --> 49:06.320
They threw you under the bus.

49:06.760 --> 49:08.480
Better him than me!

49:09.560 --> 49:10.560
"Before leaving,

49:10.640 --> 49:13.600
Renan can meet one player in person."

49:13.680 --> 49:16.600
Come over. We have so much to talk about.

49:23.680 --> 49:26.240
"Renan is on his way
to one of the apartments."

49:26.320 --> 49:28.960
Don't come over. I don't have makeup on.

49:34.560 --> 49:37.560
Renan will go meet Luma.
He's chasing tail.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.840
Luma will finally have a guest.

49:48.160 --> 49:50.680
Oh, God! Someone is knocking on my door!

49:54.480 --> 49:55.360
Renan?

49:56.480 --> 49:57.400
Baby?

49:59.680 --> 50:01.160
Anybody home?

50:03.160 --> 50:04.000
Renan?

50:06.560 --> 50:08.560
What do you mean you're Ana?
