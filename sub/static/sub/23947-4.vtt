00:13.680 --> 00:16.767
<i>-On the right, a new First.
<i>-Keith!</i></i>

00:16.850 --> 00:18.810
<i>People of the black bones,</i>

00:18.894 --> 00:22.898
<i>-gather ye together at the promised land.
<i>-Keith! Keith!</i></i>

00:29.029 --> 00:30.531
<i>Keith Flick.</i>

00:30.864 --> 00:31.865
<i>Keith.</i>

00:31.949 --> 00:32.950
Genie, no!

00:33.492 --> 00:34.785
<i>-Keith.
-Don't look!</i>

00:35.619 --> 00:36.703
<i>-Keith.
-Genie!</i>

00:37.788 --> 00:40.040
He mutilated just her face.

00:41.542 --> 00:47.297
<i>Like the cycle of death and rebirth,
<i>it will repeat itself, continuing forever.</i></i>

00:48.632 --> 00:49.466
<i>Keith.</i>

00:52.094 --> 00:55.097
<i>I love you, Keith.</i>

00:59.017 --> 01:00.477
I'll reconstruct it.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.399
<i>Falling. Shaking. Falling.</i>

01:05.816 --> 01:09.444
It'll be just like before.
Just like how she used to be.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.781
I'll put everything I have into it.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.052
<i>A new First.</i>

01:35.304 --> 01:36.888
<i>Another Fourth.</i>

01:55.741 --> 01:57.868
I guess I should go to the library.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.689
It's connected properly.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.368
Koku!

02:40.077 --> 02:40.911
Yo!

02:43.413 --> 02:45.248
-The Royal Library?
-Yes.

02:45.999 --> 02:46.833
What for?

02:48.502 --> 02:49.753
To research something.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.964
Research something?
Why not just do a web search?

02:53.548 --> 02:56.760
I don't have anything
like a computer or cell phone.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.429
Oh yeah, I've never seen you use either.

02:59.513 --> 03:03.934
-Well, I don't need them.
-Wow, really? I'd die without mine.

03:04.684 --> 03:07.396
-I won't.
-But they're so convenient!

03:07.771 --> 03:09.731
I'm not interested in convenience.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.277
You are strange, after all.

03:14.486 --> 03:17.572
I see. You have a cute face,
but you're still single

03:17.656 --> 03:20.784
-because you're nit-picky--
-Are you off today, Lily?

03:21.410 --> 03:23.495
I'm off duty, so close enough.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.664
Where are you going?

03:25.747 --> 03:27.082
Running an errand.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.837
So, Koku, what's your type?

03:32.129 --> 03:34.172
The cultured type? Older girls?

03:35.006 --> 03:37.300
How about I introduce you to my friends?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.469
Up there. Isn't that the turn?

03:39.720 --> 03:40.554
Whoops!

03:43.765 --> 03:46.893
ROYAL LIBRARY

03:50.564 --> 03:51.773
This is expired.

03:53.984 --> 03:57.112
Right here.
It expired on the seventh of last month.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.534
We can renew it right away.
If you have ID.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.917
This is expired, too.

04:11.835 --> 04:12.878
A year ago.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.926
Next person in line, please!

04:25.932 --> 04:27.684
Do you know what "Canopus" is?

04:28.059 --> 04:28.894
A star.

04:29.770 --> 04:34.399
It's not visible at this latitude, but a
little south, it's just above the horizon.

04:36.359 --> 04:39.571
I asked thinking you wouldn't know.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.740
Then you've underestimated me.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.409
Do you know a lot about the stars?

04:44.743 --> 04:48.830
Not at all. My sweetie in high school
was totally into that stuff.

04:49.581 --> 04:52.918
There's that museum next door
to the cathedral, right?

04:53.251 --> 04:57.547
He droned on and on in the planetarium
there even though I'd never asked.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.299
He put me half to sleep.

05:00.050 --> 05:03.053
For some reason,
I kind of remember the star names.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.805
Good times, good times!

05:08.350 --> 05:10.769
This "sweetie" was a boy, right?

05:12.437 --> 05:15.190
You really do underestimate me, don't you?

05:21.404 --> 05:23.198
This will be acceptable.

05:23.740 --> 05:28.495
Fill out the renewal form at window three,
down the hall to the right, and come back.

05:29.412 --> 05:33.792
-You said you could do it right away!
-They can, at window three.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.795
Okay, next in line!

06:10.704 --> 06:12.414
<i>Touch Canopus.</i>

06:26.469 --> 06:28.680
-Are you all right, son?
-Damn it.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.019
Are you all right, son?

07:14.726 --> 07:15.560
Hey there!

07:18.271 --> 07:19.773
What's wrong with your leg?

07:27.113 --> 07:28.823
-Sorry to intrude!
-Go away.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.619
-Buns!
-What are you, deaf?

07:33.370 --> 07:35.622
I said, go away.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.249
You don't like these?

07:40.502 --> 07:43.254
I also have a single
Zeppole di San Giuseppe!

07:43.964 --> 07:47.300
-Have you ever had one?
-No, I haven't. So go away.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.386
I think you can probably tell,

07:49.803 --> 07:51.930
I have no intention of backing down.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.432
I even bought buns.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.352
What a day.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.826
Can I help with anything?

08:16.413 --> 08:19.916
"Genie" means "Genius," right?
Who gave you that nickname?

08:20.458 --> 08:21.292
Boris?

08:21.626 --> 08:22.460
I don't know.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.357
So, about Killer B.

08:49.821 --> 08:53.867
Killer B, and his victims,
who are the perpetrators in these cases,

08:54.367 --> 08:57.537
are becoming more complicated
as they're becoming more brutal.

08:57.829 --> 09:01.958
They all end with your standard "serial
killer rampage and self-destruction."

09:02.042 --> 09:06.296
And the B mark left at the scenes
are more assertive than in the past.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.966
Also, did you know
that over the past few years,

09:10.050 --> 09:12.761
gold thefts have overlapped
with visually flashy crimes?

09:12.844 --> 09:16.639
They're opportunistic crimes, and Foreign
Affairs Section Two is overseeing them.

09:17.766 --> 09:21.019
Lately, Killer B-related crimes
are happening without any fanfare.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.063
That's troubling, too, isn't it?

09:23.605 --> 09:25.065
Is B really B?

09:25.523 --> 09:30.028
It's as if there's some other meaning,
and he's asking someone else what that is.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.783
And then, originally--

09:35.241 --> 09:36.076
Here.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.705
Um... This is for me?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.791
If you're not eating, leave.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.959
Thanks for the food.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.670
-So eat. Then leave.
-I said I'm not leaving.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.673
Man, you're one stubborn old dude.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.061
Lily?

10:13.988 --> 10:17.033
Everything's all jumbled up
in my head now.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.203
Coffee?

10:20.870 --> 10:22.705
I'd love some! What kind?

10:22.914 --> 10:23.748
My blend.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.294
Anyway, it's all tangled together.

10:28.503 --> 10:32.549
It's a bad omen. I can't shake
that feeling for some reason.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.094
I decided not to think,
cause everyone told me not to,

10:36.177 --> 10:37.720
but I started thinking anyway.

10:38.138 --> 10:42.725
And once I did, everything got
all jumbled up inside my head.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.146
So, after agonizing over all this stuff
all night,

10:46.229 --> 10:47.897
I decided to come here.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.153
That doesn't strike me as a smart move.

10:53.236 --> 10:56.990
"Smart doesn't mean right. Sometimes
being foolish is the right answer."

10:57.699 --> 10:59.826
That's one of your lines, isn't it?

11:00.201 --> 11:03.705
Boris, huh? He also gave you my address?

11:04.539 --> 11:07.208
He told me all sorts of things about you.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.670
He's an old-timer,
so he rambles on without me asking.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.673
But coming here today was my own idea.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.427
Tell Boris that I said
not to put dumb ideas into your head.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.889
-It's a pain.
-I thought you could untangle them.

11:22.765 --> 11:27.604
I thought that only you could
untangle the knots in my head.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.565
That's why I came. Keith Flick.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.485
Only you, the one Boris calls Genie.

11:34.569 --> 11:35.695
GENIE: GERMAN
GENIUS

11:38.114 --> 11:40.450
Why's it doing that? What's going on?

11:41.117 --> 11:44.579
So, let's say the culprit
in these incidents is this pastry.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.831
He's one tasty-looking criminal.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.000
This red bean bun is the perp.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.711
The Zeppole is Killer B.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.756
We know there's no interaction
between these two.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.716
So, there's a gap in these cases.

11:57.383 --> 12:02.472
I figure there's something in this gap
that links the two cases together.

12:03.848 --> 12:04.682
Ta-da!

12:05.600 --> 12:08.895
It looks like the red bean bun,
but it's a coffee bun.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.528
And we also tear the red bean bun
in half and...

12:22.408 --> 12:25.453
-It only makes sense this way.
-I've lost my appetite.

12:26.037 --> 12:28.581
I know, right? It's all a jumble. Chaos!

12:29.207 --> 12:30.041
And?

12:30.375 --> 12:31.376
Don't you see it?

12:32.126 --> 12:35.421
-This is the cases' structure!
-It's a mess, you mean?

12:35.713 --> 12:36.714
No!

12:36.798 --> 12:38.383
Who can understand this?

12:41.386 --> 12:43.137
The chaos is inside your head!

12:43.638 --> 12:46.015
Straighten it out and then speak, nitwit.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.393
I can't, that's why I came here!

12:48.476 --> 12:50.520
Then you should've said that first.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.523
And apologize to these buns
and their bakers.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.358
Playing with food...

12:55.441 --> 12:57.902
Idiots shouldn't make
pointless presentations.

12:57.986 --> 12:58.861
I'm not--

13:03.616 --> 13:07.453
My point is, there's a third player
out there no one knows about.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.164
It's disguised as something else.

13:10.248 --> 13:13.167
So, although it's in plain sight,
no one knows.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.504
A balance is being maintained,

13:16.587 --> 13:18.214
A CASE HIDDEN WITHIN THE CASE

13:18.297 --> 13:20.925
but when its disguise fails,
it'll take action,

13:21.009 --> 13:23.511
expand with the speed
of a subatomic particle

13:23.594 --> 13:25.763
and swallow up the whole country.

13:26.014 --> 13:29.600
And then a cycle of one incident
after another will begin,

13:30.018 --> 13:31.394
and before we know it,

13:31.477 --> 13:34.689
we'll be reduced to nothing more
than helpless onlookers.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.736
I know that it sounds stupid,
like some conspiracy theory,

13:39.861 --> 13:42.488
but I can't find anything
that disproves it.

13:42.947 --> 13:46.409
While I was thinking about it all,
my head got all jumbled up.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.330
To be perfectly honest, I'm scared now.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.387
Now you listen and listen close,
you dumb kid.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.643
Keep your nose out of this from now on.

14:14.729 --> 14:17.065
-Why should I do that?
-For your own good.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.692
What do you mean by that?

14:20.902 --> 14:25.448
It means this isn't something some idiot
should get involved in out of curiosity.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.662
If you understand, leave.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.291
Okay, I'll be frank too.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.627
Not a chance in hell!

14:39.003 --> 14:40.004
You little--

14:48.221 --> 14:49.263
Okay, then.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.182
Lily!

14:59.232 --> 15:00.066
Huh?

15:01.275 --> 15:02.110
Boris?

15:06.197 --> 15:07.031
You two...

15:09.283 --> 15:11.869
What kind of kinky stuff are you up to?

15:16.124 --> 15:18.960
Kaela, what do you want for dinner?

15:27.009 --> 15:27.844
Huh?

15:29.929 --> 15:33.349
Keith slipped and fell,
then I did when I tried to help him.

15:33.850 --> 15:34.684
That's all.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.562
Sorry. I just assumed...

15:37.645 --> 15:38.646
Why are you here?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.524
Boris!

15:45.194 --> 15:46.487
Boris sent this.

15:46.571 --> 15:49.490
"Everybody come to Keith's place,
we're gonna do something."

15:50.032 --> 15:53.953
We're having a party, right?
Mario's buying beer on his way over.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.247
I-I made a little mistake!

15:56.622 --> 16:00.334
I-I have no idea
how to use these things!

16:00.710 --> 16:02.587
You hit "group send," didn't you?

16:07.133 --> 16:09.385
By the way, why is your door broken?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.731
-How is it?
-It's very high purity.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.284
It seems fine. Well done.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.745
Where are the others?

16:36.078 --> 16:39.165
They got assignments for their cover jobs.
They're out.

16:39.832 --> 16:40.666
From Regulus?

16:41.876 --> 16:43.336
Has his mood improved?

16:44.045 --> 16:45.379
Oh, he's rather angry.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.926
Because the retrieval of our quarry
is so far behind schedule.

16:50.051 --> 16:53.763
He's tougher than expected.
He's too powerful to take on alone.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.891
Even someone
as skilled as Izanami was killed.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.769
We should rethink our capture method.

17:00.061 --> 17:04.147
Shall I go to Regulus and tell him
that's your considered opinion?

17:04.397 --> 17:05.233
No.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.746
This turned into an actual drinking party.

17:19.121 --> 17:22.124
Now, now.
Having a little fun will do you some good.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.336
This is all because of you
and your big mouth.

17:25.586 --> 17:26.753
Take responsibility.

17:27.128 --> 17:30.925
You mean about Lily?
She's an interesting one, don't you think?

17:31.092 --> 17:33.219
I'm talking about your loose lips.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.806
We've known each other for five years now,

17:36.889 --> 17:39.767
and I still can't tell
if she's smart or a fool.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.185
A fool, obviously.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.231
She gets things, even when she doesn't.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.483
She's a strange girl, for sure.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.612
A wiseass who's totally direct.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.364
She's got big brown eyes,

17:53.447 --> 17:55.992
is a lefty, and is a dainty little thing.

17:57.827 --> 18:00.079
Doesn't she remind you of her a little?

18:05.543 --> 18:10.298
Whew, it's freezing out here!
I gotta take a leak!

18:12.008 --> 18:15.344
-Boris!
-You've had enough, Kaela!

18:15.928 --> 18:18.556
-Don't be such an old man!
-I'm not an old man!

18:19.348 --> 18:21.100
She's nothing like her.

19:05.353 --> 19:06.187
Need a hand?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.069
N-No, I'm good.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.280
I was just leaving.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.036
Okay...

19:23.162 --> 19:24.538
-Bran?
-Good night!

19:25.414 --> 19:26.457
Mind the fort!

19:41.806 --> 19:43.015
Brandon?

19:45.434 --> 19:47.895
Oops! I forgot all about him!

19:49.563 --> 19:50.398
Hello?

19:51.065 --> 19:52.483
Where are you right now?

19:52.566 --> 19:54.735
<i>At Keith's place. Everybody's here.</i>

19:55.569 --> 19:56.404
Keith's?

19:56.487 --> 19:58.906
<i>Eric already left. Are you coming?</i>

19:58.989 --> 20:01.075
<i>So did Jean! That party pooper!</i>

20:01.158 --> 20:03.994
<i>-If you're coming, grab some beer!
<i>-And snacks!</i></i>

20:04.078 --> 20:05.287
<i>Don't forget snacks!</i>

20:34.692 --> 20:36.026
I'll be right there.

20:39.613 --> 20:40.656
What a weird kid.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.954
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.805
POLLUTED AREA, NO TRESPASSING

21:25.618 --> 21:28.204
<i>-Koku? Koku?
<i>-Are you okay?</i></i>

21:28.329 --> 21:29.789
<i>You sure are sentimental.</i>

21:30.122 --> 21:32.291
<i>-I hope we meet again!
<i>-We will!</i></i>

21:33.876 --> 21:34.960
<i>It's all for you.</i>

21:37.004 --> 21:38.297
<i>Touch Canopus.</i>

21:47.306 --> 21:49.642
Even if I'm called a demon because of it,

21:51.060 --> 21:52.686
I'll do whatever it takes.

21:56.690 --> 21:57.525
I'll find you.
