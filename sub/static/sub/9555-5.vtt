01:57.517 --> 01:59.485
Oh, I can't believe it, Potsie.

01:59.586 --> 02:01.452
-(Ralph cackles, hoots)
- Would you cut it out, Malph?

02:02.756 --> 02:04.087
Listen to this one.
You know how

02:04.191 --> 02:06.057
all the fraternity guys
are lying to their girls

02:06.159 --> 02:08.150
so they can take out
a baton twirler?

02:08.261 --> 02:09.092
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

02:09.196 --> 02:10.390
Potsie here actually

02:10.497 --> 02:12.397
told Jennifer
the truth about it.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.490
Yeah, how'd it work out?

02:17.137 --> 02:19.265
Good thing he doesn't
play the piano.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.772
Now, that's not funny, Malph!

02:20.874 --> 02:21.773
Come on, would you
just cut it out?

02:21.875 --> 02:23.434
Hold it,
hold it, cool it, here.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.875
Now, Weber did the right thing.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.447
- What?! -I don't know
how he thought of it,

02:27.547 --> 02:29.675
but he did the right thing.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.751
That's right, honesty
is your best policy, right?

02:31.852 --> 02:34.412
- Yeah. -You're gonna take out
a baton twirler, ain't you?

02:34.521 --> 02:36.080
- Yes, I am. -So, what are you,
what are you gonna tell...

02:36.189 --> 02:37.554
What did you tell,
uh, Lori Beth?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.023
- Yeah, what did you tell her?
- What did you tell Lori Beth?

02:39.126 --> 02:41.254
- What did you tell her?
- Well, I-l haven't told her yet.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.455
But-But, you know, we have
a mature relationship,

02:43.563 --> 02:45.691
and, uh, well, I'll just,
uh, lay it on the line.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.063
- Just gonna lay it on the line.
- She'll understand.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.602
- She's gonna understand.
- It'll be that simple.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.296
Simple like that.

02:51.405 --> 02:54.807
RALPH: Rich, here's your chance,
there she is.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.036
Go tell her, right now.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.612
- Need a guitar?
- Well... No, I'm...

03:00.747 --> 03:02.579
- Let's see how simple it is.
- Yeah, simple.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.674
- Lori Beth?
-(Ralph and Potsie chuckle)

03:06.653 --> 03:08.815
- Hi guys, how you doing?
- L.B. -L.B.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.186
You wanted to talk to me,
Sizzle Lips?

03:11.291 --> 03:13.385
I sure did.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.557
We'll talk while we dance.

03:17.664 --> 03:19.996
I just love it
when he takes charge.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.428
Lori Beth, uh, I suppose
you've heard about

03:24.538 --> 03:26.233
that fraternity dance
where everybody's supposed to

03:26.339 --> 03:28.273
take out
the baton twirlers, right?

03:28.375 --> 03:30.969
Yeah, I did.
Boy, does that burn me.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.671
Oh. yeah?

03:32.779 --> 03:34.941
Yeah, I mean, where does that
pushy fraternity get off,

03:35.048 --> 03:37.745
telling guys they have to escort
a bunch of twirlers?

03:37.851 --> 03:39.512
A lot of guys have girlfriends.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.246
Like you.

03:41.354 --> 03:44.449
Well, now there are
two sides to every story.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.923
About tonight.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.495
Yeah, Rich?

03:48.595 --> 03:52.930
♪ I seem to be
what I'm not, you see... ♪

03:53.033 --> 03:55.730
Well, so far, so good.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.565
Ah, see that?
That's where he's gonna

03:57.671 --> 03:58.866
dump the information on her.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.667
- POTSIE: Huh. -And this is where
she dumps him.

04:00.774 --> 04:01.764
(Ralph laughs)

04:04.878 --> 04:07.279
Oh, boy, is she understanding.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.280
She didn't even break anything.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.350
I can't believe it.

04:11.451 --> 04:12.816
I bet you she gets him later.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.717
She'll ambush him in the
parking lot or something.

04:14.821 --> 04:15.811
Yeah.

04:17.491 --> 04:20.051
You know, it does my heart good
to see you two lovebirds.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.822
Yeah, right. Uh, don't you have
something you have to do?

04:22.929 --> 04:25.557
Sure do. I'm going right home
and bake some cookies

04:25.665 --> 04:27.656
for your adventure tonight.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.533
Cookies...?

04:30.637 --> 04:32.071
Adventure?!

04:32.172 --> 04:33.435
What understanding!

04:33.540 --> 04:34.974
What a woman.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.237
I have to drive my Aunt Ceil
to the airport,

04:37.344 --> 04:39.312
but I'll see you at 11:00,
after you're through.

04:39.412 --> 04:40.402
Right.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.812
After he's through?!

04:42.916 --> 04:44.748
RALPH and POTSIE:
What a woman!

04:44.851 --> 04:46.979
Let me tell you something.
This understanding

04:47.087 --> 04:49.613
is far and above
any middle class.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.454
Oh, and Rich,
please be careful.

04:52.559 --> 04:55.961
It could be dangerous driving
around that police car tonight.

04:56.062 --> 04:58.622
It's his journalism assignment.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.427
- Yeah.
- LORI BETH: See you.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.369
Shh!

05:05.472 --> 05:06.735
Police car.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.901
You told her you were driving
around in a police car.

05:10.010 --> 05:13.139
Hey Rich, does a police car
twirl a baton?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.640
<i>HOWARD:
Hey, Richard? Better hurry up,</i>

05:17.751 --> 05:20.049
<i>you can't be late
for the police car.</i>

05:20.153 --> 05:21.484
<i>RICHIE:
Yeah, right Dad, thank you.</i>

05:21.588 --> 05:24.182
How'd you know
about the police car?

05:24.291 --> 05:25.588
MARION:
Oh, Lori Beth stopped by

05:25.692 --> 05:27.490
-while you were in the shower.
- Oh.

05:27.594 --> 05:30.393
She brought these cookies
for tonight.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.364
Oh, yeah, nice.
Oh, plenty of raisins.

05:33.466 --> 05:36.197
Richard, now, uh, prowling--
that sounds awfully dangerous

05:36.303 --> 05:38.863
to me;
the dark streets and thugs

05:38.972 --> 05:41.304
and flying bullets
and all this stuff.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.604
Marion, the police
are not gonna take him

05:43.710 --> 05:45.405
into a dangerous situation.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.038
Yeah, well, I guess
I better get going.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.343
HOWARD:
Good luck to you.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.144
Thanks.

05:51.251 --> 05:52.150
10-4.

05:52.252 --> 05:53.981
Police jargon.

05:56.489 --> 05:59.117
Well, let's take a look at the
TV Guide and see what's on.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.593
I'm not going in a police car.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.029
Well, thank heavens, Richard.

06:05.131 --> 06:07.259
I'm taking out Corrine,
the baton twirler.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.665
That's right,
I'm cheating on Lori Beth.

06:09.769 --> 06:10.998
Oh, my goodness.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.799
Is this the way
we brought you up?

06:12.906 --> 06:16.103
You're gonna cheat on a girl
who made you oatmeal cookies?

06:16.209 --> 06:17.540
(Richie groans)

06:17.644 --> 06:19.078
Marion, will you calm down?

06:19.179 --> 06:21.978
We haven't heard
the whole story yet.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.550
What's the story, Richard?

06:23.650 --> 06:25.209
Well, it's fraternity business.

06:25.318 --> 06:26.376
Hey, maybe
I'm not really cheating.

06:26.486 --> 06:27.647
I mean, all the guys

06:27.754 --> 06:29.916
have to take out baton twirlers,
that's all.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.991
- Go on... -Well, it's not
as if we're sneaking around.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.423
I mean, we're going
to a public place,

06:33.526 --> 06:35.085
we're-we're eating public food.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.562
And what would happen
if Lori Beth were to walk in?

06:37.664 --> 06:41.532
The public would see me with
a baton wrapped around my neck.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.364
(chuckles)
A baton wrapped around...

06:44.571 --> 06:46.005
Just trying to cheer myself up.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.631
It's not working, is it?

06:47.741 --> 06:50.039
No... well, it's because
I'm cheating on Lori Beth,

06:50.143 --> 06:52.669
and-and worse than that,
I lied to her.

06:52.779 --> 06:56.044
Look, Richard, I-l don't know
all the circumstances here,

06:56.149 --> 06:57.674
but it would seem to me that

06:57.784 --> 07:01.414
if-if you told Lori Beth
a little white lie to save her

07:01.521 --> 07:03.011
a big hurt, well,

07:03.123 --> 07:06.388
-maybe that's all right.
- Well, yeah, but that...

07:06.493 --> 07:09.087
that still doesn't make me
feel any better about it. I...

07:09.195 --> 07:10.356
All right, I'm gonna
call Lori Beth,

07:10.463 --> 07:11.658
I'm gonna tell her
the whole thing.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.961
Good boy.
We brought you up right.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.330
I can't call Lori Beth.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.301
<i>She's taking her Aunt Ce“
to the airport.</i>

07:17.404 --> 07:18.872
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.997
Look, tonight you'll go out
on this date and...

07:21.107 --> 07:24.133
And tomorrow you'll tell your
little white lie to Lori Beth,

07:24.244 --> 07:26.679
and hope things will
turn out right and normal.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.511
What can happen?
She's a baton twirler, right?

07:29.616 --> 07:31.311
Her arms are probably tired.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.614
Well, I-l got to go.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.779
Thanks for your help.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.187
You know, life...

07:38.291 --> 07:40.282
is tough.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.597
Hey, Al.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.169
Oh, hi, Rich. Listen...

07:49.269 --> 07:52.000
Al, I'm smooth.

07:52.105 --> 07:56.235
Oh, am I smooth.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.334
I mean, you got Valentino,

07:58.445 --> 08:00.641
you got Gable,
you got Fonzarelli

08:00.747 --> 08:02.613
and now you got...

08:02.716 --> 08:04.115
Cunningham.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.616
Yeah, Rich, I know...

08:05.719 --> 08:08.188
Yeah, Gable and Cunningham,
I mean, it surprises me too,

08:08.288 --> 08:11.417
but, what fancy footwork
tonight-- oh!

08:11.524 --> 08:15.017
First, I put the brush on this
gorgeous baton twirler, Corrine,

08:15.128 --> 08:18.530
but now, on to the main event--
Lori Beth.

08:18.631 --> 08:20.622
Here, at 11:00.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.461
Richie, Richie, Richie,

08:24.571 --> 08:27.097
Richie, Richie, Richie,
Richie, Richie, Richie...

08:27.207 --> 08:29.904
Yowza, yowza, yowza,
yowza, yowza.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.707
Hi, Richard.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.303
Corrine.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.679
Look, didn't I just drop you off
at the sorority house?

08:37.784 --> 08:39.650
Oh, Rich, it's no fun there.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.049
No fun?! Are you kidding?
Uh... the pillow fight

08:41.154 --> 08:42.587
is just beginning.
You don't want to miss that.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.714
You know, I was in one of those
once, Al; I know

08:44.824 --> 08:46.656
-she doesn't want to miss it.
- Why would I want

08:46.760 --> 08:48.285
to pillow fight
when I can be with you?

08:48.395 --> 08:51.387
Besides, it's too early
to go home.

08:52.499 --> 08:55.491
Not for me... (yawns loudly)

08:55.602 --> 08:57.570
Oh, I got to be in
by 11:00.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.071
You know, Al, I've discovered
if I don't get my eight hours

09:00.173 --> 09:02.005
of sleep, I'm just cranky
all the next day.

09:02.108 --> 09:05.772
- I'm very, very cranky.
- There's plenty of time; relax.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.541
Let's sit down, Richiekins.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.275
Richiekins? Uh...

09:10.383 --> 09:12.681
Look, uh, why don't you just
sit right over here and...

09:12.786 --> 09:14.777
and I'll be with you
in a second, okay?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.879
(quietly):
Al, Al...

09:19.492 --> 09:21.620
- Yeah?
- All right, Al,

09:21.728 --> 09:23.856
you got to give me the keys
so I can close up tonight.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.590
I'm meeting Lori Beth
here later.

09:25.698 --> 09:29.430
Richiekins,
Richiekins, Richiekins...

09:29.536 --> 09:31.300
Look, I can't be rude to her.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.599
L-I'm gonna talk to her,

09:32.705 --> 09:34.139
I'm gonna get rid of her

09:34.240 --> 09:36.106
and then it's me
and Lori Beth, forever.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.938
Oh, Rich,

09:38.044 --> 09:40.035
"what a tangled web we weave...

09:42.449 --> 09:44.884
when first we practice
to deceive."

09:46.286 --> 09:49.153
- All right, all right,
here's the key. -Oh, thanks, Al.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.883
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah...

09:54.727 --> 09:56.718
♪ Scooby, doo-bee, doo... ♪

10:03.436 --> 10:06.337
Yeah, right, Al, I think
she's a great girl, too.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.703
(laughs)
Yeah, that... that Al.

10:08.808 --> 10:11.334
Oh, what a great guy he is.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.345
- You're a great guy.
- Well...

10:14.447 --> 10:19.180
Here, uh, let me
sit next to you.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.775
Real close.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.288
Well, that-that's close.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.983
(anxious chuckle)

10:26.092 --> 10:28.186
Corrine, you're
crushing my cookies.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.587
You know, my cookies.

10:33.733 --> 10:34.996
Well, they're not
too crushed yet.

10:35.101 --> 10:36.364
Uh, do you want one?

10:36.469 --> 10:37.903
No, thanks.

10:38.004 --> 10:40.666
Don't know what
you're missing-- oatmeal and...

10:40.773 --> 10:44.107
All right... (clears throat)

10:44.210 --> 10:45.939
(anxious laugh)

10:46.045 --> 10:49.345
So, uh, what are you
studying at-at Michigan?

10:49.449 --> 10:51.144
Philosophy.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.482
Do you know what,
uh, philosophy teaches us?

10:54.587 --> 10:55.782
Uh, l...

10:55.889 --> 10:57.152
It teaches us to

10:57.257 --> 11:00.591
take life as it comes.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.254
Kissing fingers?
They-They do that at Michigan?

11:07.534 --> 11:09.434
Uh, all right,
all right, philosophy.

11:09.536 --> 11:12.267
Uh, well, and, uh, who's
your favorite philosopher?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.566
Don't have a favorite, huh?

11:17.343 --> 11:19.744
Well, I guess my favorite
has always been, uh,

11:19.846 --> 11:21.211
Confucius.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.907
You know, uh...

11:23.016 --> 11:25.576
"That which is done," uh,

11:25.685 --> 11:29.246
is needless to," uh...

11:29.355 --> 11:30.789
Well, I don't remember
what he said,

11:30.890 --> 11:32.881
but it was great stuff.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.425
Okay, so much for philosophy.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.997
Uh, baton twirling...

11:38.097 --> 11:40.657
uh, how long have you been
ba-twirling the baton?

11:42.268 --> 11:44.259
That long, huh?

11:46.272 --> 11:47.967
Uh, you know,
I never could do that.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.599
Yeah, I, uh, I played
the saxophone

11:49.709 --> 11:51.734
a little bit.
Of course, I-l never...

11:51.844 --> 11:53.835
twirled it, I...

11:57.951 --> 11:59.646
What, Richiekins?

11:59.752 --> 12:01.743
Who knows? You talk too much.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.074

12:11.864 --> 12:13.491
Lori Beth.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.592
She's gonna know. It's probably
written all over my face.

12:18.805 --> 12:21.570
Guilt, guilt, guilt.

12:21.674 --> 12:24.006
All right, look,
what are you so worried about?

12:24.110 --> 12:25.544
Now, you and Lori Beth
aren't married,

12:25.645 --> 12:28.012
I mean, you're not even
going steady. It...

12:28.114 --> 12:30.549
It's because
you like her, bucko.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.846
Will you look at this?
I'm talking to myself.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.716
I got to gain
a little composure, here.

12:34.821 --> 12:35.947
I just got to...

12:36.055 --> 12:37.750
to be cool.

12:37.857 --> 12:40.588
(shuddering breath)

12:40.693 --> 12:43.025
All right, nobody's gonna know.

12:43.129 --> 12:45.461
- There.
-(footsteps approaching)

12:45.565 --> 12:47.055
Hi, Fonz.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.794
You cheated.

12:49.902 --> 12:53.270
It-it's written
all over my face, isn't it?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.205
Cheat! Cheat! Cheat!

12:55.308 --> 12:56.935
Especially around the lip area.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.511
- Look at this here.
- What?

12:58.611 --> 13:00.602
Huh, what is that,
Coral Pink Number Five?

13:00.713 --> 13:01.874
Not even L.B.'s shade.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.380
You should hang your lips
in shame.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.541
Oh.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.949
I know, Fonz,
but Corrine was amazing.

13:07.053 --> 13:09.351
I mean, uh, well,
she-she touched my chest.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.423
- So what?
- She nibbled my ears.

13:11.524 --> 13:12.423
So what?

13:12.525 --> 13:13.822
She kissed my fingers.

13:13.926 --> 13:17.556
She kissed your fingers?
She must be from Michigan.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.325
I'm not interested!

13:19.432 --> 13:22.697
Look, I don't cotton to liars,
and I don't cotton to cheaters.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.065
Fonz, my coat!

13:24.170 --> 13:26.935
Couldn't you just be quietly
ashamed of me?

13:27.940 --> 13:29.840
A former Eagle Scout!

13:29.942 --> 13:32.912
Is there no... is there no end
to life's disillusionments?

13:33.012 --> 13:34.537
Next thing I'm gonna find out is

13:34.647 --> 13:37.639
that Tonto hated
the Lone Ranger, or vice versa.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.151
You're right-- cheat, liar!

13:40.253 --> 13:43.245
Taking cookies under
false pretenses, that's me.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.257
If I could turn back
the hands of time...

13:46.359 --> 13:47.622
I wouldn't be the skeevey,

13:47.727 --> 13:50.162
grungy, lowly, miserable,
awful...

13:50.263 --> 13:51.628
All right, all right,
all right, Cunningham!

13:51.731 --> 13:54.166
We'll see what
we can do about this.

13:54.267 --> 13:58.932
You'd help a skeevey, grungy,
lowly, miserable...

13:59.038 --> 14:01.063
You're right--
I don't help cheaters.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.471
I don't help liars.
Forget it.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.976
On the other hand, if I did...
No, forget it! Forget it!

14:05.078 --> 14:07.706
What? On the other hand,
what, Fonz? What would you do?

14:07.814 --> 14:10.374
- Mint leaves.
- Mint leaves.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.679
Wait! What would I do with them?
Would I chew 'em?

14:12.785 --> 14:14.275
Rub 'em all over you.

14:15.988 --> 14:17.217
(mouthing)

14:17.323 --> 14:18.415
No, not in there.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.494
Come on, Al,
you gotta have some.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.359
I can't believe Al doesn't have
any mint leaves in here!

14:24.464 --> 14:26.592
How can he expect
to run a successful business

14:26.699 --> 14:29.361
when he doesn't even know
how to stock a bathroom?

14:29.469 --> 14:31.096
Oh, look at this.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.502
Everything
but what you really need.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.405
All right...
all right, you got to improvise.

14:36.509 --> 14:37.772
Soap.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.538
Soap is strong.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.611
(sniffing)

14:42.715 --> 14:43.614
Great!

14:43.716 --> 14:45.844
Next best thing
to mint leaves.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.181
Now for the clothes.

14:47.286 --> 14:48.481
(sniffing)

14:48.588 --> 14:50.556
Oh, yeah, definitely Corrine.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.590
- All right, gotta air this out.
-(knocking on door)

14:52.692 --> 14:54.319
LORI BETH:
Richie, you here?

14:54.427 --> 14:56.759
Huh? Oh... brother.

14:56.863 --> 14:59.628
Uh, yeah,
yeah, I'm in here, Lori Beth.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.291
Just, uh, alone, though.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.836
I'm just totally
by myself, uh...

15:03.936 --> 15:05.665
I'll be right out, okay?

15:05.772 --> 15:08.742
Oh... never gonna forgive Al
for not having mint leaves.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.502
-(knocking)
- Richie, what are you doing?

15:10.610 --> 15:11.771
Taking a bath?

15:11.878 --> 15:14.006
She knows!

15:14.113 --> 15:16.104
Uh, taking a bath?

15:16.215 --> 15:18.547
(forced laugh)
What a kidder.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.621
No, no, but I'll be out
in just a second, okay?

15:24.891 --> 15:26.416
Tell you what.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.961
Just-just stay as far away
from her as you can,

15:29.061 --> 15:31.052
and you're gonna be fine.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.292
What are you shaking for?!

15:33.399 --> 15:35.197
I'm the one in trouble.

15:35.301 --> 15:37.292
Here I come, Lori Beth.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.899
- Hi, Rich. -Hi.
-(mellow musical intro plays)

15:41.007 --> 15:43.908
Did something happen
in the police car?

15:44.010 --> 15:45.603
Oh, no, nothing, uh, serious...

15:45.711 --> 15:47.611
just, uh,
apprehended a thug, you know.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.909
Uh, got a little rough.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.347
♪ We gotta say good-bye... ♪

15:51.451 --> 15:53.010

15:54.921 --> 15:56.218

Richie, what's the matter?

16:02.829 --> 16:04.194
Nothing. Nothing's the matter.

16:08.835 --> 16:09.961
Oh, that was nice.
I enjoyed that.

- Home? I just got here.

16:13.673 --> 16:17.041
You're acting
awfully strange tonight.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.133
I'm not acting strange.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.042
I'm acting perfectly normal.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.205
Uh, let's dance.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.340
My-my knee already started.

16:24.450 --> 16:25.679
Let's go.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.116
Richie, wait a minute!

16:27.220 --> 16:29.518
This is a slow dance.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.521
Oh, oh, right.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.591
We gotta dance close.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.592
Yeah.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.526
(instrumental interlude plays
on jukebox)

16:36.629 --> 16:38.688
Rich? (sniffs)

16:38.798 --> 16:40.095
Why are you going...? (sniffing)

16:40.199 --> 16:41.928
You smell like soap.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.934
Soap!

16:44.036 --> 16:46.004
Of course. I'm clean.

16:46.105 --> 16:48.631
A man washes,
what do you expect? Soap.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.675
Boy, are you sensitive.

16:50.776 --> 16:52.767
Come on, let's, uh,
sit this one out.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.870
Oh, that's a great idea.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.646
Boy, did I miss you.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.867
- Lori Beth?
- Yeah, Rich?

17:16.969 --> 17:18.868
I cheated. I lied.

17:18.971 --> 17:21.440
I was out
with a baton twirler tonight!

17:21.540 --> 17:23.737
No squad car.
I-l was with Ralph and Potsie

17:23.843 --> 17:25.367
and their girls and-and Corrine,

17:25.478 --> 17:27.776
and-and I wanted to discuss
philosophy, she wanted to neck.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.008
She won.
She wore me down, Lori Beth.

17:30.116 --> 17:32.107
She wore me down.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.380
I feel so much better.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.390
I'm glad
I got that off my chest.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.790
You know something?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.488
You are easy to talk to.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.565
Now we can go
to Inspiration Point.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.963
Wait a minute!

17:48.067 --> 17:50.502
Now we're gonna talk some more.

17:50.603 --> 17:54.562
Exactly how much wearing down
was there?

17:54.674 --> 17:57.006
How much was there?

17:57.109 --> 17:59.601
Well, there was...

17:59.712 --> 18:01.111
I mean, you know...

18:01.213 --> 18:02.874
Well, she was...

18:02.982 --> 18:04.245
And I...

18:04.350 --> 18:05.943
Uh, she...

18:06.052 --> 18:08.043
She... wore me right down.

18:10.189 --> 18:12.590
Richie, I don't understand.

18:12.692 --> 18:16.424
Do you remember the day
of our first date?

18:16.529 --> 18:19.021
- It was at the library.
- Sure.

18:19.131 --> 18:23.034
You came up and asked if
you could sit down next to me.

18:23.135 --> 18:25.467
We were, uh, freshman. I...

18:25.571 --> 18:28.802
And I asked you
if you were in a fraternity,

18:28.908 --> 18:30.433
and you said "yes."

18:30.543 --> 18:32.375
You told me the name
of the fraternity.

18:32.478 --> 18:33.968
Yeah, uh...

18:34.080 --> 18:36.071
Mama Papa Sister.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.212
And then you admitted
you really lived at home.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.656
I said to myself,

18:45.758 --> 18:49.388
"Now there's a nice boy,
an honest boy".

18:49.495 --> 18:51.486
And then my lips had to wander.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.830
But I could forgive you
for the kissing, Rich.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.334
Men are so weak.

18:57.436 --> 18:59.871
Oh, I know. It's weak flesh.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.408
But tonight,
you lied to me, Richie.

19:03.509 --> 19:05.409
You lied.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.980
I can never forgive you
for that.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.284
Bye, Richie.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.949
Good-bye, Lori Beth.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.127
A lot of action
in this booth tonight.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.434
<i>RALPH: Okay, Lori Beth,
you are a free woman.</i>

19:32.538 --> 19:34.438
<i>You ought
to try our new business:</i>

19:34.540 --> 19:37.202
The Ralph and Potsie
Dating Service.

19:37.309 --> 19:41.507
Our motto is, "You want a hunk,
we sift out the junk."

19:43.082 --> 19:45.312
That's right, and we've got
all sorts of different prices.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.977
For five bucks, we'll set you up

19:47.086 --> 19:48.747
with the campus
créme de la créme.

19:48.854 --> 19:49.946
Pass.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.217
Well, then,
there's our buck special.

19:51.323 --> 19:53.223
We stand you
in front of the men's dorm

19:53.325 --> 19:54.690
and shout, "Come and get her!"

19:54.794 --> 19:57.525
Forget it, Ralph.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.428
Pots, she's a good friend,
right?

19:59.532 --> 20:00.931
Real good friend.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.798
For you, Potsie and I will give
you the best deal we've got--

20:03.903 --> 20:06.065
absolutely free--
a charming guy.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.469
Very charming.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.701
Oh, you'll love him.
He's a good friend of ours.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.140
Red hair, freckles.

20:11.243 --> 20:12.404
Size nine shoes.

20:12.511 --> 20:13.808
And a cheater.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.813
Nice try, fellas,
but the answer is "no."

20:15.915 --> 20:17.679
N-O.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.418
Fonz, I want to go home. I...

20:24.523 --> 20:26.719
How long are you going
to keep this up?

20:26.826 --> 20:29.158
You're making me nutso, you're
making your parents nutso.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.025
You sit in front
of the TV set,

20:31.130 --> 20:35.192
you spend three days watching
Divorce Court.

20:35.301 --> 20:38.327
It's the only program
I identify with.

20:38.437 --> 20:41.668
Well, I'll meet you outside.

20:44.844 --> 20:48.940
Oh, Rich, isn't he a real hunk?

20:49.048 --> 20:50.641
I mean, a college man.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.912
Did you see the patches
on the sleeves?

20:53.018 --> 20:56.852
Only phonies
and Robert Young wear patches.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.151
JOANIE:
Oh, yeah?

20:58.257 --> 21:01.158
Well,
Robert Young doesn't cheat.

21:02.194 --> 21:04.094
(shouting);
oh, yeah?

21:04.196 --> 21:05.891
Well, how do you know that?

21:05.998 --> 21:07.090
You get over here.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.031
Now I know
that you're going bananas!

21:09.135 --> 21:11.126
Everybody knows
that Robert Young don't cheat!

21:11.237 --> 21:13.467
Oh. Of course.

21:13.572 --> 21:15.165
Now, look at this.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.766
I'm in a lousy mood, so I'm
taking it out on Robert Young.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.242
See, then,
why don't you do me a favor,

21:19.345 --> 21:20.676
do your parents a favor,
do yourself a favor,

21:20.780 --> 21:22.179
and make up with her?

21:22.281 --> 21:23.407
You think I didn't try?

21:23.516 --> 21:24.711
I called her.
She won't come to the phone.

21:24.817 --> 21:25.943
You don't have to call her here.

21:26.051 --> 21:27.951
She's right there, see? Go on.

21:28.053 --> 21:29.350
Get over there.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.718
Sweet.

That's-that's great.

22:50.469 --> 22:53.370

it could never be the same.

22:53.472 --> 22:56.237
Oh.

22:56.342 --> 22:58.811
Yeah.

22:59.845 --> 23:01.870
But maybe we could...

start over again... clean.

23:05.851 --> 23:09.219
Yeah.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.289
We could do that.

Uh, all right, all right,

No, I don't do that

And then, one day,
he started cheating on her.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.077
Well, maybe he couldn't help it.

24:40.179 --> 24:43.410
Maybe he never got it out
