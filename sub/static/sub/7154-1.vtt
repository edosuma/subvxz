34:09.547 --> 34:12.318
HOW COME YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY KIDS?

34:12.318 --> 34:15.154
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF DOUGH
FOR LOTS OF THEM.

34:15.154 --> 34:18.157
IT WOULD BE HARD FOR ME
TO HAVE CHILDREN.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.558
I'M NOT MARRIED.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.161

FROM WEDDINGS, YOU KNOW.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.795
THEY COME FROM
RIGHT DOWN--

34:23.795 --> 34:25.397
UH, NO.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.398
I KNOW.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.301
THE PROPER WAY
TO HAVE A FAMILY

34:29.301 --> 34:32.170
IS TO START
WITH A WEDDING, ISN'T IT?

34:32.170 --> 34:34.773
WELL, UNLESS
YOU HAVE A BABY FIRST.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.574

SO MUCH.

BUT WHAT IF I GET SCARED?

37:29.348 --> 37:31.350
WELL...

37:31.350 --> 37:33.952
THERE'S NO REASON
TO BE SCARED.

TO LOAD THE HUMP,

48:00.946 --> 48:03.648
YOU LOAD THE HUMP.
THAT'S OUR PHILOSOPHY.
