<i> MARTIN:</i>
<i> Maybe you're all</i>
<i> torn up inside because</i>

00:04.130 --> 00:06.488
getting away with murder
didn't feel bad at all.

00:06.549 --> 00:08.081
DR. MARSH:
Martin?

00:08.217 --> 00:09.249
No, it felt good.

00:09.385 --> 00:10.676
DR. MARSH:
Martin?

00:11.795 --> 00:14.588
Anything you'd like to share?

00:14.849 --> 00:17.182
Well, I... I am speechless.

00:17.334 --> 00:21.186
I mean, I had no idea we had
such a Casanova in our midst.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.504
Hector!

00:22.565 --> 00:24.414
I enjoy making love.

00:24.475 --> 00:26.025
Well, that much is clear.

00:26.176 --> 00:27.417
DR. MARSH:
Actually, Martin,
I was asking you

00:27.436 --> 00:29.177
if you'd like
to share about yourself.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.531
This is your first session back,
and you've seemed preoccupied.

00:32.724 --> 00:35.183
So tell us: how are you doing?

00:35.286 --> 00:39.521
I'm, uh... good.

00:39.582 --> 00:40.873
-Really?
-Well,

00:41.066 --> 00:43.358
I suppose I am a...
(clears throat)

00:43.419 --> 00:47.171
little worried about my boy.

00:49.625 --> 00:51.216
What are you...?

00:51.368 --> 00:53.535
JESSICA:
Why haven't you been
seeing your therapist?

00:53.554 --> 00:55.370
Good morning, Mother.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.871
Nice ambush.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.449
I'm worried. I haven't gotten
a bill from Gabrielle in months.

01:00.052 --> 01:02.377
-You're paying my therapy bills?
-Darling, I've been

01:02.396 --> 01:04.063
paying that woman
for over 20 years.

01:04.256 --> 01:05.956
And let's just say,
at her rates,

01:05.974 --> 01:07.791
she has nothing
to be depressed about.

01:07.851 --> 01:09.960
I've... taken a break
from therapy.

01:09.978 --> 01:10.977
What happened?

01:11.072 --> 01:12.813
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.740
Even if it is sexual
in nature...

01:14.891 --> 01:17.301
It's nothing.
Really. I'm fine.

01:17.361 --> 01:18.410
And how is your family?

01:18.603 --> 01:20.245
Incredible.

01:20.438 --> 01:24.308
Both my kids
are in such a good place.

01:24.368 --> 01:26.827
-(gasps)

01:26.921 --> 01:29.088
I have never felt prouder.

01:29.281 --> 01:31.998
Just the life
of a serial killer's son.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.151
It's a psycho roller coaster.

01:34.253 --> 01:35.761
Well, he's in a tricky spot,
my son.

01:35.954 --> 01:38.655
And there are things
troubling him

01:38.715 --> 01:41.842
that he buries deep inside.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.751
-Why?
-You wouldn't understand.

01:43.854 --> 01:46.163
I married your father. Try me.

01:46.223 --> 01:47.922
<i> MARTIN:</i>
<i> Well, these feelings, um,</i>

01:48.025 --> 01:50.517
you know,
they're-they're building up.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.093
With no way to get out.

01:52.154 --> 01:55.188
Mother, I know you want to,
but you can't help me.

01:55.341 --> 01:57.341
(sighs)
Well, surely there is someone

01:57.401 --> 01:59.601
on this earth
that you<i> can</i> talk to.

01:59.662 --> 02:02.121
He's only got me.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.498
Dear old dad.

My boy.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.952
How's my little hero
doing today?

02:18.013 --> 02:20.788
Let's see. He barely
recognizes himself anymore

02:20.808 --> 02:22.366
because of what he's done.

02:22.426 --> 02:25.719
<i> His dreams are</i>
<i> a horror movie stuck on repeat.</i>

02:25.871 --> 02:27.220
And the only person
he can talk to about it

(whispering):
is a narcissistic psychopath.

02:29.099 --> 02:30.891
-Oh, fun.
<i> -Not fun.</i>

02:30.985 --> 02:35.821
I think Mother is starting
to... sense something.

02:36.014 --> 02:38.473
She probably thinks
it's sexual in nature.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.974
I'm not talking about this.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.885
Well, I know you're not,
and that's the problem.

02:41.904 --> 02:43.328
Come visit.

I have access to the yard.

02:51.672 --> 02:56.583
Oh, it's all very exciting--
sunscreen, yard fights.

02:56.735 --> 02:58.068
I have to go.

02:58.086 --> 02:59.327
You know, it's not going away,
Malcolm--

02:59.388 --> 03:00.512
the guilt.

03:00.664 --> 03:02.848
<i> Take it from me.</i>

03:09.523 --> 03:11.248
What are you doing?

03:11.308 --> 03:13.099
Setting the table.

03:13.252 --> 03:14.693
(horns honking outside)

03:14.886 --> 03:17.196
Oh, my God.

03:17.389 --> 03:18.697
Are these...?

03:18.890 --> 03:21.258
Is this what you used?

03:21.276 --> 03:22.850
(chuckling):
The family silver?

03:22.953 --> 03:24.519
-(sighs)
-No, I'm just, uh,

03:24.622 --> 03:27.039
-shocked at the sight
of you doing chores. -Huh.

03:27.232 --> 03:28.916
Hysterical.

03:29.067 --> 03:30.858
It is strange, though,

03:30.920 --> 03:34.004
how little I remember
from that night.

03:34.924 --> 03:37.607
I remember being there.

03:37.626 --> 03:39.384
He was there.

03:39.577 --> 03:42.370
You showed up.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.056
And then there's a gap.

03:44.249 --> 03:46.783
That's dissociative amnesia.

03:46.802 --> 03:49.394
It's one of the ways your brain
protects you from a trauma.

03:49.587 --> 03:53.457
Cool. Let's talk about something
a million times more fun.

03:53.558 --> 03:55.141
I'm moving back to my apartment.

03:55.236 --> 03:58.052
That's great.
Uh, did Mom freak out?

03:58.072 --> 04:00.981
No, which actually
freaked me out.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.242
Malcolm, I am so glad
that you're here.

04:03.435 --> 04:05.469
Your sister has mountains
of clothes to move,

04:05.529 --> 04:07.788
and I am in charge of boxes.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.657
You're helping her move?

04:10.809 --> 04:12.826
Of course. I wanted to help her.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.402
Just like I wanted to help you.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.813
Okay, what is it?

04:16.873 --> 04:18.114
Something's changed.

04:18.208 --> 04:19.816
She stopped playing
the piano, too.

04:19.876 --> 04:22.669
Oh. Is there still vodka
in your orange juice?

04:22.821 --> 04:24.263
All right, enough.

04:24.456 --> 04:26.172
What exactly do you two think
you're doing?

04:26.267 --> 04:27.491
Isn't it obvious?

04:27.551 --> 04:28.842
We're meddling.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.660
Please, I don't meddle.

04:30.721 --> 04:32.271
I mother.

04:32.464 --> 04:36.090
-This sudden interest
in our well-being... -Mm?

04:36.151 --> 04:37.759
It wouldn't have anything to do

04:37.820 --> 04:40.946
with you and a certain
lieutenant, would it?

04:41.139 --> 04:43.097
-Gil?
-(Jessica scoffs)

04:43.117 --> 04:45.117
Wait. You and Gil are...?

04:45.286 --> 04:47.511
Oh, are you mad? No.

04:47.529 --> 04:50.122
There is absolutely nothing
going on with me and Gil Arroyo.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.531
I don't believe you.

04:51.683 --> 04:52.682
-Well...
-(phone buzzing)

04:52.784 --> 04:53.941
-It's Gil.
-Oh.

04:54.003 --> 04:55.352
Ask him about Mom.

04:55.454 --> 04:57.111
Hmm.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.780
Does he let you wear
his turtlenecks?

04:58.841 --> 05:00.782
-Ainsley, enough. Malcolm?
-Hmm.

05:00.801 --> 05:06.138
Not a word, or the NYPD will be
investigating your murder next.

05:06.331 --> 05:08.348
(crow cawing)

05:11.169 --> 05:13.061
JT.

05:13.930 --> 05:15.689
I've been calling.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.725
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.153
-Hands up!
-Yo, I got my badge!

05:21.346 --> 05:22.562
Stop fighting, boy.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.990
-Busy.
-You sure?

05:25.183 --> 05:27.475
'Cause when I say, "I'm fine,"
I'm always lying.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.069
I don't want to talk about it.

05:29.221 --> 05:31.913
I got enough on my mind
with this creepy-ass case.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.418
(whirring)

05:45.554 --> 05:47.995
(garbled radio transmission)

05:48.057 --> 05:49.348
Morning.

05:49.499 --> 05:51.908
Ah, it's beautiful in here,
isn't it?

05:51.968 --> 05:55.095
Well, e-except
for this, I guess.

05:55.189 --> 05:58.023
-Holy...
-Watch it, Bright.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.524
(sighs)

05:59.717 --> 06:01.109
Restraints.

06:02.387 --> 06:04.863
Holy water.

06:05.014 --> 06:06.198
And the crucifix.

06:06.391 --> 06:09.259
I'm not religious,
but this is...

06:09.277 --> 06:11.277
Ritualistic? (laughs)
Look at us.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.498
Finishing each other's
sentences, even from up here.

06:15.751 --> 06:19.786
The victim is
Father Ramon Reyes, 56.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.621
He's been at the church
for 30 years.

06:21.773 --> 06:22.956
EDRISA:
This is amazing.

06:23.092 --> 06:25.550
He's been
expertly exsanguinated.

06:25.702 --> 06:27.368
JT:
Gil.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.221
This is Sister Agnes.

06:29.414 --> 06:31.890
She found the body
and called 911.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.186
I'm sorry, Sister.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.898
Can you walk us through
what happened?

06:40.049 --> 06:41.549
I had been assisting
Professor Shaw

06:41.610 --> 06:44.736
with the restoration
of the cathedral paintings.

06:44.929 --> 06:48.222
I was downstairs,
and then, when I came up,

06:48.283 --> 06:50.133
I saw this...

06:50.152 --> 06:51.985
-evil.
-BRIGHT: Sister Agnes,

06:52.079 --> 06:55.062
did Father Reyes
perform exorcisms?

06:55.082 --> 06:56.415
Seriously, Bright?

06:56.608 --> 06:59.584
Well, this is
<i> The Rite of Exorcism.</i>

06:59.777 --> 07:01.811
And it's well used.

07:01.872 --> 07:03.813
Pretty sure
this is our victim's blood.

07:03.874 --> 07:06.741
So, answer the question, Sister.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.010
I-I can't talk about this.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.488
That's not a "no."

07:11.590 --> 07:12.822
EDRISA:
Who-Whoever it was,

07:12.883 --> 07:14.157
they left a note.

07:14.217 --> 07:17.227
The blood-- it makes a symbol.

07:19.723 --> 07:21.589
What does it say?

07:21.692 --> 07:23.758
Uh, looks like Hebrew or...

07:23.819 --> 07:26.169
Aramaic. It says,

07:26.229 --> 07:27.671
"Abaddon."

07:27.731 --> 07:30.264
Abaddon the Destroyer,

07:30.325 --> 07:32.692
angel of the abyss
from Revelations?

07:33.737 --> 07:35.770
So now we know
our killer's name.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.772
Who is it?

07:37.833 --> 07:40.183
Oh, you know...

07:40.243 --> 07:42.335
the devil.

07:49.027 --> 07:51.361
Look, um, you should go back
to the rectory,

07:51.421 --> 07:53.120
Sister Agnes, get some rest.

07:53.223 --> 07:56.183
I'd rather work at the studio.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.980
Ugh. This is all so...

08:02.131 --> 08:03.389
Catholic.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.151
Well, I was going
to say "insane," but...

08:06.344 --> 08:08.895
Did you know Father Reyes well,
Professor Shaw?

08:09.047 --> 08:11.156
Well, just in passing.
Call me Jonah.

08:11.349 --> 08:13.717
You're not a member
of the church?

08:13.777 --> 08:15.719
No. I'm a conservator,

08:15.820 --> 08:18.722
preserving the paintings
with Sister Agnes.

08:18.782 --> 08:22.483
We've been working on a Madonna
and Child the past few months.

08:22.586 --> 08:23.985
Did you know he was an exorcist?

08:24.087 --> 08:26.579
You'd see people come and go.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.990
-Hear things.
-(door opens)

08:29.092 --> 08:31.568
-(door closes)
-Excuse us.

08:31.628 --> 08:34.254
Archbishop Argento?

08:34.389 --> 08:36.740
(sighs)
Officers.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.183
Thank you for being here.

08:38.352 --> 08:39.576
I only just heard.

08:39.636 --> 08:41.335
We're very sorry for your loss.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.021
I'm overcome.

08:43.172 --> 08:47.675
But we must trust that faith
will help us find the light.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.269
Outside of faith alone,

08:49.363 --> 08:51.363
we're going to need
to see Father Reyes's records.

08:51.556 --> 08:54.424
Every person he exorcised is
a suspect up to this point.

08:54.442 --> 08:57.018
I am sorry, but I can't
discuss Father Reyes' work

08:57.037 --> 08:58.703
or share his records.

08:58.855 --> 09:02.207
They contain our parishioners'
confidential information.

09:02.358 --> 09:03.524
You understand.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.336
We do, Your Eminence.
Thank you.

09:12.553 --> 09:13.718
(door opens)

09:13.911 --> 09:15.387
(door closes)

09:15.580 --> 09:16.888
What was that?

09:17.081 --> 09:18.873
The archbishop just
obstructed justice,

09:18.892 --> 09:20.225
and you thanked him for it.

09:20.418 --> 09:22.452
It's called
establishing a rapport, Bright.

09:22.554 --> 09:24.804
It's the way things get done,
especially with the church.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.231
Have a little faith, okay?

09:26.424 --> 09:28.124
(scoffs)
Nietzsche said that faith means

09:28.184 --> 09:29.793
not wanting to know the truth.

09:29.853 --> 09:31.403
Nietzsche, hmm?

09:31.554 --> 09:33.738
Kid, what is going on
in that head of yours?

09:34.616 --> 09:36.983
Nothing. I'm fine.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.578
Then give me a profile.

09:39.771 --> 09:41.913
Right. Uh...

09:42.106 --> 09:44.641
consistent wounds speak
to a methodology,

09:44.701 --> 09:46.309
and the bloodletting--

09:46.369 --> 09:49.254
this killer was performing
a ritual of his own.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.832
Obviously, our demon
did not want to be exorcised.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.484
We're not looking
for a real demon.

09:54.544 --> 09:57.320
No, but what if
our killer identifies as one?

09:57.380 --> 10:00.657
They could be suffering
from possession trance disorder.

10:00.717 --> 10:02.917
It's a kind
of dissociative disorder.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.161
The symptoms present
like possession.

10:05.221 --> 10:06.846
How does bloodletting figure
into this?

10:06.940 --> 10:09.423
I'm not sure. Not yet.

10:10.611 --> 10:16.323
But... I do know another killer
who bled his victim dry.

10:20.478 --> 10:22.662
Oh, beautiful.

10:23.481 --> 10:25.665
Just beautiful.

10:27.878 --> 10:30.003
I'm so glad you came.

10:31.489 --> 10:32.797
Smells like urine.

10:32.990 --> 10:34.782
Oh, that'll be the urine.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.635
Shall we?

10:36.786 --> 10:38.803
(chains jingling softly)

10:38.996 --> 10:41.306
So tell me, son, how are you?

10:41.457 --> 10:43.700
Yeah, you're going
through quite a change.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.143
I wouldn't call it that.

10:45.294 --> 10:47.220
Where have I heard that before?

10:47.356 --> 10:50.874
As I recall, we were
on a stroll just like this

10:50.934 --> 10:53.134
when I first explained
the birds and the bees.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.894
(chuckling):
Oh.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.063
Oh, you were shocked
at the changes your body...

10:57.215 --> 10:58.898
Are you gonna help me
with my case or not?

10:58.992 --> 11:00.884
Oh, I can do more than help.

11:00.944 --> 11:05.221
Um, after you called,
I had a splendid idea.

11:05.240 --> 11:09.650
Now, we have so many...
special minds here.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.652
Why not call in an expert?

11:11.755 --> 11:13.563
BRIGHT:
Who is that?

11:13.581 --> 11:15.565
Friar Pete. An old neighbor.

11:15.625 --> 11:18.418
He was ejected from
his monastery for extreme views,

11:18.553 --> 11:21.237
and then went on
a killing spree.

11:21.297 --> 11:24.090
The Friar Flayings.

11:24.226 --> 11:25.742
I've brought him on to consult.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.936
Wonderful.

11:32.717 --> 11:33.900
(metallic clink)

11:35.529 --> 11:37.845
Care to confess your sins?

11:37.864 --> 11:39.698
Oh, that's a marvelous idea.

11:39.891 --> 11:41.241
You two should talk.

11:42.351 --> 11:44.018
I'm trying to solve a murder.

11:44.079 --> 11:46.763
An exorcist was killed,
bled to death.

11:46.781 --> 11:50.709
Our medical examiner counted
44 precise incisions.

11:50.902 --> 11:52.618
It's an ominous number-- 40.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.787
Jesus spent 40 days
in the wilderness

11:54.923 --> 11:56.548
fending off the devil.

11:56.741 --> 11:58.624
As for four...

11:58.777 --> 12:01.869
Well, perhaps the four humors,
considering the cuts.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.556
How about Hans von Gersdorff?

12:04.749 --> 12:06.540
(chuckles softly)
Of course.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.967
Hans von who?

12:08.061 --> 12:11.062
Gersdorff.
16th-century surgeon

12:11.255 --> 12:13.214
who determined the 44 points

12:13.275 --> 12:15.641
by which
a human would best be bled.

12:15.794 --> 12:18.570
He goes into great detail
in his<i> Field Guide to Surgery.</i>

12:18.763 --> 12:21.222
The illustrations are lovely.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.224
Oh, medicine has nothing
to do with it.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.302
The killer is obsessed
with ritual. Catholic ritual.

12:26.362 --> 12:28.805
Oh, I'm surprised
you don't see the connection.

12:28.865 --> 12:30.139
Well, they used to go
hand-in-hand.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.975
FRIAR PETE:
For centuries, exorcisms

12:32.035 --> 12:34.143
were prescribed
to patients suffering

12:34.204 --> 12:37.330
from the bubonic plague,
mental illness,

12:37.424 --> 12:38.815
lead poisoning.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.651
Guys, the victim didn't die
600 years ago.

12:41.711 --> 12:44.262
There's no connection between
exorcism and medicine today.

12:44.413 --> 12:46.155
FRIAR PETE:
Not true.

12:46.257 --> 12:49.100
Today the church can't perform
its rite without permission.

12:49.293 --> 12:51.293
MARTIN:
Well, isn't that helpful?

12:51.354 --> 12:53.772
Permission from whom,
Friar Pete?

12:54.691 --> 12:57.650
A physician, Dr. Whitly.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.784
(crow cawing)

13:08.196 --> 13:11.122
So, can you believe Gil got the
archbishop to open up his files?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.516
A Catholic neurologist
recommended

13:13.576 --> 13:16.777
his patient see Father Reyes
as a last resort.

13:16.838 --> 13:18.612
This isn't about evil.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.131
It's about a sickness.

13:20.324 --> 13:23.784
The doctor said his patient
Norman is untreatable--

13:23.845 --> 13:25.953
violent, disturbed
and possessed.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.531
Sounds plenty evil to me.

13:28.550 --> 13:31.351
(crow cawing)

13:35.506 --> 13:37.890
How long has Norman
lived up here, ma'am?

13:37.984 --> 13:39.818
Five years now.

13:40.011 --> 13:42.469
He wanted his own space.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.948
We agreed it was for the best.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.234
Does he take any medication?

13:48.328 --> 13:49.994
Not anymore.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.757
Norman?

14:04.627 --> 14:06.903
It's Mother.

14:06.963 --> 14:09.180
You have visitors.

14:10.466 --> 14:12.350
Can they come in, Norman?

14:15.021 --> 14:17.230
NORMAN:
All right, Mother.

14:40.738 --> 14:43.381
Whatever you do...

14:43.574 --> 14:45.925
stay inside the lines.

14:46.077 --> 14:48.720
(overlapping, eerie chatter
in foreign language)

14:59.900 --> 15:02.650
(playing eerie,
slow hymn on piano)

15:05.855 --> 15:08.156
(door creaking)

15:09.910 --> 15:10.909
(door closes)

15:11.102 --> 15:12.410
(floorboard creaks)

15:12.603 --> 15:14.637
Hi, Norman.

15:14.697 --> 15:17.156
I'm Malcolm,

15:17.250 --> 15:18.658
and this is JT.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.251
What's up, man?

15:20.420 --> 15:21.902
(plays jarring chord)

15:21.922 --> 15:23.922
Mother said you were coming.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.982
Good.

15:27.118 --> 15:30.595
We're trying to find out
who killed Father Reyes.

15:30.746 --> 15:32.931
Do you know anything about that?

15:35.084 --> 15:37.435
When was the last time
you saw each other?

15:37.628 --> 15:39.854
Last week.

15:43.134 --> 15:45.151
He came to the house.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.177
Do you ever go and see him?

15:54.237 --> 15:57.604
If I lived up here, I'd sneak
out that window all the time.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.374
No.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.518
No, there's no salt out there.

16:02.578 --> 16:07.924
Father Reyes told me
I had to stay... here.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.719
The salt keeps him out.

16:13.181 --> 16:13.972
Who?

16:14.165 --> 16:15.622
NORMAN:
The demon.

16:16.518 --> 16:19.185
Father Reyes shouts at him,
but still...

16:20.430 --> 16:21.813
...he finds me.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.298
What does Father Reyes shout?

16:24.359 --> 16:26.275
"The power of Christ
compels you!"

16:29.864 --> 16:31.714
Excuse me.

16:31.733 --> 16:34.701
I have to practice.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.737
He's got to be the guy, right?

16:37.831 --> 16:39.572
-I'm not sure.
-Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

16:39.724 --> 16:41.390
Norman believes he's possessed.

16:41.451 --> 16:45.986
Okay, he's clearly mentally ill,
but he doesn't leave this house.

16:46.089 --> 16:49.565
He won't even cross
an inch of salt.

16:49.625 --> 16:50.916
I wonder what would happen...

16:51.011 --> 16:53.236
Dude, you heard the lady. Don't.

16:53.296 --> 16:54.920
I have to test him.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.756
I have to cross this line.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.516
No, you really don't, Bright.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.001
-Bright...
-(wood creaking)

17:01.021 --> 17:04.522
NORMAN:
Do you have a favorite hymn?

17:04.673 --> 17:08.417
I know "You Are Near"...

17:08.436 --> 17:10.177
See? Nothing happened.

17:10.238 --> 17:14.014
..."There Was a Fountain
Filled with Blood,"

17:14.075 --> 17:17.326
"Hail Mary: Gentle..."

17:30.717 --> 17:32.675
I knew it was you.

17:34.745 --> 17:35.720
(low-pitched):
You're a demon.

17:35.913 --> 17:37.538
(chuckles):
Uh...

17:37.599 --> 17:39.223
No, Norman.

17:39.416 --> 17:41.041
I'm not a demon.

17:41.102 --> 17:46.789
I could smell it on you
the moment you walked in.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.317
You are like me.

17:50.353 --> 17:53.654
That's why you came here.

17:54.765 --> 17:55.965
JT:
Bright.

17:56.025 --> 17:58.317
What do you mean, I'm like you?

17:58.453 --> 18:01.137
You're a killer, too.

18:01.197 --> 18:02.488
I did it.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.974
I killed him.

18:05.034 --> 18:06.809
-Bright, step back.
-(gun clicks)

18:06.869 --> 18:08.753
-It's okay.
-(panting)

18:10.614 --> 18:11.831
Why did you kill Reyes?

18:11.925 --> 18:13.332
NORMAN:
He wanted it out,

18:13.426 --> 18:15.651
but it doesn't want out.

18:15.753 --> 18:17.428
He's in my blood.

18:17.621 --> 18:21.157
He's in your blood.

18:21.259 --> 18:22.683
(shouting)

18:24.461 --> 18:25.344
(screams)

18:25.438 --> 18:27.605
(whimpers)

18:27.798 --> 18:29.756
(electrical crackling)

18:29.818 --> 18:31.425
JT:
Malcolm Bright,

18:31.486 --> 18:34.028
always crossing the line.

18:43.832 --> 18:47.016
JT called from the hospital.
Norman's sedated.

18:47.034 --> 18:49.034
Does he remember confessing?

18:49.187 --> 18:50.536
Probably not.

18:50.746 --> 18:53.522
Norman suffers from
recurrent identity disturbances,

18:53.583 --> 18:55.800
voice changes, memory loss.

18:55.993 --> 18:59.786
Okay, now, what the hell
do you have?

18:59.848 --> 19:01.622
Hmm? JT told us what happened.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.956
You provoked Norman.

19:03.017 --> 19:05.701
I provoked Norman
to test a theory.

19:05.761 --> 19:08.295
GIL:
That he's the killer?
Norman ticks a lot of boxes.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.130
Father Reyes performed
exorcisms on him for a year.

19:10.191 --> 19:12.725
That's plenty of time for him
to learn that Aramaic.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.710
And time to develop motive.
It tracks.

19:14.770 --> 19:16.320
-It doesn't.
-Are you serious?

19:16.513 --> 19:18.489
JT said the guy
went full Linda Blair.

19:18.682 --> 19:19.732
That's the problem.

19:19.884 --> 19:22.385
When I crossed the line of salt,

19:22.486 --> 19:24.220
it triggered Norman.

19:24.238 --> 19:26.906
He became frenzied,
out of control.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.894
Father Reyes's murder
displayed total control.

19:31.913 --> 19:34.413
-44 precise incisions.
-BRIGHT: Right.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.249
If Norman was triggered
by Father Reyes' exorcism,

19:37.343 --> 19:39.251
he couldn't perform
the bloodletting.

19:39.387 --> 19:42.571
So we're looking for a possessed
person with a steady hand?

19:42.632 --> 19:45.908
How does somebody learn
medieval bloodletting?

19:45.968 --> 19:47.334
BRIGHT:
I know that.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.687
They read the manual.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.597
What the hell is this?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.265
My father gave it to me.

19:53.418 --> 19:56.510
Hans von Gersdorff's
<i> Field Guide to Surgery,</i>

19:56.529 --> 19:58.270
from 1517.

19:58.364 --> 20:01.014
It's the how-to for the system
of bloodletting our killer used.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.533
He must have read it.

20:02.726 --> 20:04.109
I-I know it sounds insane.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.852
DANI:
For this case? Not really.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.664
I mean, I interviewed a nun
who knows Aramaic.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.268
Maybe she knows something
about this, too.

20:13.604 --> 20:17.790
(sighs) There it is,
all packed and ready to go.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.383
I couldn't have done it
without you.

20:19.576 --> 20:22.053
Aw, well... (chuckles)

20:22.246 --> 20:25.038
What now? We could order dinner.

20:25.058 --> 20:28.726
-Watch a movie, mix a cocktail?
-I think we should talk.

20:28.919 --> 20:31.287
The moving, the meddling.

20:31.389 --> 20:34.457
When you're upset,
you keep busy.

20:35.518 --> 20:38.218
-You're distracting yourself.
-Oh, that's absurd.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.964
What on earth would I have
to distract myself from?

20:42.024 --> 20:43.157
Gil.

20:44.619 --> 20:45.985
I checked your phone.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.137
Seven missed calls from him?

20:48.197 --> 20:49.413
I...

20:50.399 --> 20:51.640
I can't believe you.

20:51.701 --> 20:53.584
Okay, I-I shouldn't
have snooped.

20:53.736 --> 20:54.994
But something
is clearly going on,

20:55.146 --> 20:56.420
and we're just not
gonna talk about it?

20:56.613 --> 20:59.848
-We are WASPs. It's what we do.
-(sighs) Mom.

20:59.917 --> 21:03.886
But you like Gil.
Just talk to him.

21:05.789 --> 21:08.099
(sighs, groans)

21:11.354 --> 21:12.344
I will.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.848
After I have one final night

21:15.942 --> 21:18.651
with my very wise daughter.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.905
-(glasses clink)
-(laughs softly)

21:36.320 --> 21:37.277
Sister Agnes?

21:38.289 --> 21:41.448
-Yes?
-Sorry to interrupt.

21:42.343 --> 21:45.452
The archbishop said
we could find you here.

21:45.555 --> 21:47.530
Are you familiar with this book?

21:47.590 --> 21:51.124
I, uh, don't think so. Why?

21:51.144 --> 21:54.036
I think the killer
was using it for inspiration.

21:54.096 --> 21:57.273
They believed that Father Reyes
had evil in him.

21:58.651 --> 22:02.153
You're troubled.
Prayer helps, you know.

22:02.346 --> 22:04.488
Therapy, prayers, pills.

22:04.681 --> 22:05.823
What's the difference?

22:05.974 --> 22:07.216
God.

22:07.276 --> 22:09.385
Whatever burdens you,
give it to him.

22:09.445 --> 22:11.554
He will carry it for you.

22:11.572 --> 22:13.739
No one can carry this.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.649
GIL:
Bright?

22:15.668 --> 22:17.168
Over here!

22:18.546 --> 22:20.896
Ainsley?

22:20.956 --> 22:23.065
-What are...?
-You have to tell them, Malcolm.

22:23.125 --> 22:25.325
-Tell them what?
-What you did.

22:25.386 --> 22:26.827
You can't keep it a secret.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.754
They'll find out.
They're detectives.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.589
We have to fix this.

22:30.725 --> 22:32.350
You know what Dad would do.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.167
No. Not like that.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.520
-Not again.
-You have evil inside you.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.230
Use it!

22:44.221 --> 22:46.697
Oh, I was, um...

22:46.890 --> 22:48.699
asleep.

22:48.892 --> 22:51.017
Yeah, we noticed.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.204
Why are you wearing body armor?

22:53.397 --> 22:56.432
Because you fell asleep.

22:56.450 --> 22:58.542
Your nightmares are...

22:58.735 --> 23:00.285
kind of epic.

23:00.421 --> 23:01.620
Yeah.

23:01.756 --> 23:04.006
Tell me about it.

23:08.704 --> 23:12.139
You give any thought to whether
you want to make a statement?

23:13.059 --> 23:16.877
I'm thinking I... wait a beat.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.730
You know, let things...
shake out.

23:21.258 --> 23:23.818
What things?

23:30.410 --> 23:33.652
Look, I know you've got my back.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.913
But what about them?

23:36.106 --> 23:38.974
You think they'll play nice
if I file a grievance

23:39.034 --> 23:40.809
about a fellow cop?

23:40.911 --> 23:42.420
I'm about to be a father,

23:42.588 --> 23:45.405
and I'm already looking
over my shoulder now.

23:45.425 --> 23:47.149
If I escalate this,

23:47.251 --> 23:50.219
who's to say
things don't get worse?

23:51.589 --> 23:53.338
Do you think I'm wrong?

23:53.491 --> 23:55.683
Can I be straight?

23:59.963 --> 24:01.355
I don't know.

24:03.634 --> 24:05.776
Nothing about this is right.

24:11.325 --> 24:12.783
You good, boss?

24:12.952 --> 24:15.327
Been checking
that phone extra today.

24:16.330 --> 24:18.038
Yeah.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.959
Maybe you're right.

24:22.152 --> 24:24.920
Sometimes you got to wait.

24:26.615 --> 24:28.841
See how things play out.

24:36.425 --> 24:38.642
Thanks for driving me home.

24:38.794 --> 24:40.627
Can't believe I fell asleep.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.462
You're welcome.

24:42.523 --> 24:44.815
Though you might want to work
on your light reading choices.

24:45.008 --> 24:47.151
(chuckles) The book...

24:47.344 --> 24:49.394
was not in my dream.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.638
That nun was.

24:51.699 --> 24:54.066
Sister Agnes.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.976
Which was weird.

24:56.037 --> 24:58.478
Are you sure you're not
into this religious stuff?

24:58.498 --> 25:00.739
Could've fooled me.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.000
(laughs) Come on.

25:03.151 --> 25:06.670
No one captures the destitution
of the soul like Goya.

25:06.839 --> 25:10.232
It's creepy, Bright.

25:10.292 --> 25:12.492
Well, Goya...

25:12.553 --> 25:14.762
was actually quite the romantic.

25:18.634 --> 25:19.850
Of course, he went insane.

25:20.002 --> 25:22.411
All the best artists did.

25:22.471 --> 25:23.854
Their work destroyed them.

25:24.006 --> 25:25.856
Are you any different?

25:27.142 --> 25:30.027
You've been on edge lately,
even for you.

25:30.980 --> 25:32.905
You want to talk about it?

25:34.224 --> 25:35.533
I'm fine.

25:35.726 --> 25:36.867
Really.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.351
Hmm.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.204
How about you?

25:40.397 --> 25:42.164
It's bad out there.

25:44.735 --> 25:46.952
It's always bad.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.954
Difference is
people are paying attention.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.865
It's like they just realized

25:51.959 --> 25:55.761
that the world is racist
and cops target black people.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.349
JT and me don't get a pass.

26:02.052 --> 26:04.728
I swear this job
is gonna kill me.

26:04.921 --> 26:06.789
Like your painter.

26:06.890 --> 26:09.141
Who, Goya?

26:09.293 --> 26:10.793
Well, the job didn't kill him.

26:10.853 --> 26:12.778
It was the lead in the paint.

26:18.694 --> 26:21.161
What is it?

26:22.531 --> 26:24.489
Lead poisoning.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.642
From the paint.

26:26.702 --> 26:29.420
It causes dementia...

26:29.613 --> 26:31.755
paranoia...

26:31.948 --> 26:34.316
symptoms that manifest

26:34.418 --> 26:35.926
like possession.

26:36.119 --> 26:37.744
Sister Agnes and the professor,

26:37.763 --> 26:38.929
they're restoring old paintings.

26:39.122 --> 26:41.849
We have to get
to the cathedral now.

26:44.687 --> 26:46.586
Archbishop Argento?

26:46.689 --> 26:48.421
I can't believe you're here.

26:48.524 --> 26:49.923
We were just about to call.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.834
-What happened?
-It's Sister Agnes.

26:51.894 --> 26:54.594
She didn't... she didn't
show up for work today.

26:54.614 --> 26:56.839
Professor Shaw, the Madonna
that you've been restoring,

26:56.899 --> 26:58.991
are you in contact
with lead white paint?

27:00.328 --> 27:02.845
Yes, but we wear
masks and gloves. I...

27:02.905 --> 27:04.955
Why? I don't understand.

27:05.148 --> 27:07.182
Sister Agnes could be suffering
from paranoid delusions

27:07.242 --> 27:08.792
brought on by lead poisoning.

27:08.985 --> 27:11.170
-She thinks she's possessed.
-(nearby banging)

27:12.581 --> 27:13.981
What was that?

27:14.008 --> 27:15.782
It came from the crypt.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.693
But we're the only people here.

27:17.753 --> 27:19.119
Bright, stay with them.

27:19.180 --> 27:21.388
Dani, JT, you're with me.
Let's go.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.391
♪

27:33.653 --> 27:35.194
(nearby banging)

27:49.835 --> 27:51.335
(louder banging)

28:05.059 --> 28:06.332
Jonah?

28:06.394 --> 28:08.577
She's going to be okay.

28:08.595 --> 28:10.688
I taught her.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.523
I taught her
how to handle the paint.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.316
I-I did.

28:16.812 --> 28:18.862
Call for backup.

28:23.727 --> 28:25.444
This is Detective Tarmel.

28:25.596 --> 28:28.163
We need backup
at 2617 Mott Street.

28:30.084 --> 28:31.858
Do you copy? Come in.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.419
<i> OFFICER (over radio):</i>
<i> Who is this?</i>

28:34.422 --> 28:36.046
Tarmel, Major Crimes.

28:36.239 --> 28:38.123
<i> OFFICER:</i>
<i> This is a police channel.</i>

28:38.259 --> 28:41.385
<i> Impersonating a cop is</i>
<i> a finable offense,</i>

28:41.536 --> 28:43.387
<i> Detective Tarmel.</i>

28:46.559 --> 28:48.450
Lead poisoning.

28:48.552 --> 28:50.060
I didn't expect that.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.621
Poor Agnes.

28:52.723 --> 28:55.023
Tell me, Your Grace.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.293
Do exorcisms ever work?

28:58.353 --> 29:01.421
In some cases, yes.

29:01.449 --> 29:03.315
Although...

29:03.409 --> 29:05.650
I don't take you for a believer.

29:05.803 --> 29:08.136
(chuckles)

29:08.197 --> 29:10.164
I wish.

29:11.625 --> 29:13.751
I really do.

29:13.902 --> 29:17.496
To say, "The power of Christ
compels you,"

29:17.631 --> 29:19.965
and what's wrong disappears?

29:21.284 --> 29:24.344
Would make my life
so much easier.

29:25.714 --> 29:28.323
Nothing's ever easy.

29:28.383 --> 29:31.159
Forget the prayers
and the rites.

29:31.220 --> 29:34.897
Priests spend most
of their time listening.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.442
Anything you want to discuss?

29:39.761 --> 29:42.946
JONAH:
I told her to use the mask,
wear the gloves.

29:43.098 --> 29:44.764
Use the mask, wear the gloves.

29:44.825 --> 29:46.283
Use the mask...

29:53.459 --> 29:55.876
-Boss.
-(nearby banging)

30:02.343 --> 30:04.450
-(muffled moaning)
-It's okay.

30:04.512 --> 30:06.119
You're gonna be okay.

30:06.180 --> 30:07.679
(muffled sobbing)

30:09.058 --> 30:11.716
Sister Agnes,
who did this to you?

30:11.869 --> 30:14.627
Told her, told her, I told her.

30:14.688 --> 30:18.023
I told her. (whimpers)

30:20.986 --> 30:23.320
Is that the painting
they've been working on?

30:23.471 --> 30:24.905
ARGENTO:
Yeah.

30:37.953 --> 30:39.578
He ruined it.

30:39.672 --> 30:40.912
It's Jonah.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.156
He's the one
poisoned by the paint.

30:43.217 --> 30:45.083
(muttering)

30:45.219 --> 30:46.751
Don't.

30:46.846 --> 30:48.753
-Huh?
-You need to go.

30:48.848 --> 30:49.754
I'll keep an eye on him.

30:49.849 --> 30:51.682
-Okay.
-Father?

30:51.851 --> 30:53.517
Lock the doors behind you.

30:53.686 --> 30:56.186
(laughter)

30:58.357 --> 31:00.023
(line ringing)

31:00.175 --> 31:02.526
Mr. David,
I need emergency phone time.

31:02.719 --> 31:03.768
King me.

31:03.863 --> 31:06.438
(gate creaks)

31:06.532 --> 31:08.106
Mr. David, please!

31:08.200 --> 31:10.442
-I'm winning.
-It's Malcolm.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.611
My boy? What's wrong?

31:12.763 --> 31:15.372
I need you to tell me everything
you know about lead poisoning.

31:15.565 --> 31:17.357
I found the killer,
and he's hallucinating

31:17.376 --> 31:18.600
because of the lead paint.

31:18.619 --> 31:20.285
<i> MARTIN:</i>
<i> Bravo. Good work.</i>

31:20.379 --> 31:23.455
Like all the grand masters--
Michelangelo, Caravaggio...

31:23.607 --> 31:24.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that.

31:24.958 --> 31:26.884
But what I don't know
is how to fix it.

31:27.077 --> 31:28.719
How can I help him,
counteract the poison?

31:28.912 --> 31:30.962
<i> MARTIN:</i>
<i> No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

31:31.056 --> 31:32.556
<i> He's in a full-blown</i>
<i> psychotic state.</i>

31:32.707 --> 31:34.224
You'll wind up
like van Gogh's ear.

31:34.417 --> 31:36.542
No, lock him in a room
and don't let him out.

31:36.604 --> 31:40.022
Got it. And what if I'm locked
in the room with...

31:41.642 --> 31:44.026
-...him?
-Ah.

31:50.266 --> 31:53.301
Jonah, it's okay.

31:53.362 --> 31:54.653
You're hallucinating.

31:54.805 --> 31:56.821
All that old paint.

31:56.957 --> 31:59.491
You came into contact with lead.

31:59.643 --> 32:01.977
I'm manipulating
the paint with my fingers

32:02.037 --> 32:04.755
to achieve a classical effect.

32:04.948 --> 32:07.816
I made it beautiful.

32:07.876 --> 32:09.167
BRIGHT:
No.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.428
It made you sick.

32:11.579 --> 32:14.264
Made you act out
what you saw in that book.

32:14.457 --> 32:15.674
No.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.492
Think you're possessed,
but you're not.

32:17.552 --> 32:18.493
No.

32:18.553 --> 32:19.770
This isn't real.

32:19.921 --> 32:21.163
MARTIN:
That's lovely, son.

32:21.223 --> 32:23.589
Your bedside manner
is excellent.

32:23.651 --> 32:25.517
<i> Nice and calm.</i>

32:25.611 --> 32:27.277
Jonah?

32:28.322 --> 32:29.854
Listen to me.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.432
There's no demon inside of you.

32:32.493 --> 32:35.268
JONAH:
Oh, you're wrong.

32:35.329 --> 32:38.789
I am Abaddon!

32:41.502 --> 32:44.444
Abaddon... the Destroyer.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.354
Malcolm, you remember
Friar Pete?

32:46.415 --> 32:47.673
What does it mean?

32:49.009 --> 32:50.783
Your son is going to die.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.952
Gotcha. Well, Malcolm,

32:52.972 --> 32:55.363
I don't think a talk-down's
gonna work in this instance.

32:55.424 --> 32:57.123
Okay, what do you recommend?

32:57.226 --> 32:59.792
Friar Pete,
in your expert opinion?

32:59.853 --> 33:01.812
Exorcism is the only way.

33:02.005 --> 33:03.555
Exorcisms don't work.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.131
Possession isn't real.

33:05.192 --> 33:06.725

<i> No, but psychosis is.</i>

<i> Now, you may not believe</i>

33:12.491 --> 33:14.140
Okay.

33:14.201 --> 33:17.035
How do I perform an exorcism?

Just repeat after me.

34:07.904 --> 34:09.671
You have it, too.

34:10.698 --> 34:11.864
What?

34:11.925 --> 34:13.699
No, ignore him.
Just say the words.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.536
The power of Christ compels you!

34:16.597 --> 34:18.388
(giggling)

34:18.557 --> 34:20.648
The power of Christ compels you.

34:20.717 --> 34:22.117
Repeat it. Believe it!

34:22.135 --> 34:23.042
Louder!

34:23.220 --> 34:25.353
The power of Christ compels you!

34:26.732 --> 34:27.622
The power of Christ

34:27.724 --> 34:29.399
<i> compels you!</i>

34:29.592 --> 34:30.400
<i> The power</i>

34:30.593 --> 34:31.793
of Christ

34:31.853 --> 34:34.053
-compels you!
-No. No. No, no.

34:34.114 --> 34:36.631
(groaning):
No...

34:36.691 --> 34:38.325
No!

34:44.941 --> 34:46.917
What-what happened? Son?

34:47.086 --> 34:48.810
<i> Son?</i>

34:48.870 --> 34:50.587
(exhales)
I finished the ritual.

34:50.738 --> 34:52.147
(exhales)

34:52.207 --> 34:53.648
(chuckles)

34:53.708 --> 34:55.483
All right.

34:55.585 --> 34:57.094
Well done, team.

34:57.287 --> 34:59.262
(laughs)

35:03.852 --> 35:06.995
When we call for backup,
you come.

35:07.922 --> 35:09.514
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

35:09.608 --> 35:10.798
He identified himself!

35:10.818 --> 35:13.426
(sighs) This is bad.

35:13.487 --> 35:14.945
Don't you hide behind that.

35:15.138 --> 35:17.197
JT:
And it'll only get worse.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.991
They made that clear.

35:22.237 --> 35:24.788
Every damn day for ten years,

35:24.981 --> 35:27.582
I put my life on the line
like every other cop here.

35:28.743 --> 35:31.211
But those guys didn't see that.

35:32.131 --> 35:34.614
They just saw a Black man.

35:34.675 --> 35:36.691
And they put a gun in his face.

35:36.751 --> 35:38.784
The union needs to hear that.

35:38.846 --> 35:40.953
This doesn't end
unless we end it.

35:41.014 --> 35:42.364
You're not alone, JT.

35:42.424 --> 35:43.974
I have to protect my job.

35:44.167 --> 35:45.183
My family.

35:46.353 --> 35:47.460
This is my family.

35:47.521 --> 35:49.771
I know.

35:50.858 --> 35:52.732
I'll take care of it.

Yes.

36:25.300 --> 36:26.725
Well...

36:28.562 --> 36:31.354
Been a while since I was here.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.023
Since we were together.

36:33.192 --> 36:34.316
Months.

36:38.554 --> 36:40.155
So much has changed.

36:41.816 --> 36:44.367

(sighs)

36:54.237 --> 36:56.421
Jess, what is going on here?

36:57.883 --> 36:59.716
We were talking. We had plans.

36:59.885 --> 37:02.219
I thought we had...

-(exhales)
-I know you came to see me

37:07.267 --> 37:08.374
at the hospital.

37:08.435 --> 37:10.018
You signed the guest book.

37:11.939 --> 37:13.355
What happened?

37:14.557 --> 37:15.815
I'm cursed.

37:18.628 --> 37:20.128
You overheard Dani and me.

37:20.146 --> 37:20.904
(sighs)

37:21.097 --> 37:22.797
But she wasn't wrong.

37:22.857 --> 37:24.407
I'm broken.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.634
My marriage with Martin,

37:26.653 --> 37:27.911
this world that I grew up in,

37:28.104 --> 37:30.154
it has sh... shattered me.

37:31.399 --> 37:34.325
And anyone who tries
to get close gets cut.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.810
-That's not true.
-Gil,

37:35.870 --> 37:37.754
you were stabbed because of me.

37:37.947 --> 37:40.815
And if we were to try this,
if we were to...

37:40.875 --> 37:42.676
for real...

37:44.379 --> 37:47.322
I would feel that worry
and guilt every waking moment.

37:47.382 --> 37:49.766
What guilt? Jess...

37:51.011 --> 37:53.186
Jess, you saved me.

37:56.558 --> 37:58.692
(Jessica exhales)

38:03.115 --> 38:05.740
Then let me save you again.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.203
You should go.

38:13.834 --> 38:15.333
Please.

38:32.853 --> 38:34.702
How much of that did you hear?

38:34.763 --> 38:36.371
Not much.

38:36.389 --> 38:38.723
Just the part where you said
our family is cursed.

38:38.859 --> 38:40.558
-Mm.
-Dad ruined us all.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.819
-Ainsley...
-Mom, no.

38:43.012 --> 38:44.821
I told you to be honest.

38:45.014 --> 38:46.489
And you were.

38:46.682 --> 38:48.550
(exhales)

38:48.568 --> 38:50.785
You're a little broken.

38:51.538 --> 38:53.038
And...

38:55.375 --> 38:57.334
I may be, too. (chuckles)

38:58.670 --> 39:01.896
Which is why I'm not moving out.

39:01.956 --> 39:04.082
I'm staying here.

39:04.217 --> 39:06.676
With you.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.087
Case closed.

39:09.181 --> 39:10.588
Huzzah!

39:10.724 --> 39:12.331

39:12.434 --> 39:17.020
Who knew Hans von Gersdorff was

39:17.171 --> 39:19.689
Thanks again for the help.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.067
MARTIN:
I-I obviously didn't do enough.

39:24.387 --> 39:27.030
What bothers you, my boy?

39:27.223 --> 39:30.182
Come on, you can tell me
anything, my son.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.701
Come on.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.412
Unburden yourself.

39:37.417 --> 39:38.783
(sighs)

39:38.919 --> 39:41.193
It's just, uh...

39:42.622 --> 39:45.757
I'm the one who decided
to dispose of Endicott's body.

39:46.909 --> 39:48.551
To lie to Ainsley.

39:48.744 --> 39:51.388
Cover the whole thing up.

39:51.581 --> 39:53.223
That was me.

39:53.416 --> 39:55.392
Or...

39:55.585 --> 39:57.060
maybe it was me.

39:57.253 --> 39:58.377
(scoffs)

39:58.438 --> 39:59.712
How's that?

39:59.731 --> 40:00.955
You possessed me?

40:01.057 --> 40:03.883
Well, isn't that
what parenting is?

40:03.944 --> 40:06.794
Your mother and I, we are
the power that compels you.

40:06.813 --> 40:08.630
I mean, usually
to brush your teeth

40:08.690 --> 40:10.389
or pay your bills,

40:10.409 --> 40:13.827
but you knew exactly what
your sister needed.

40:14.788 --> 40:17.305
You knew how to save her.

40:17.365 --> 40:19.582
Because of...

40:19.775 --> 40:20.917
You.

40:23.371 --> 40:24.421
(scoffs)

40:24.614 --> 40:26.673
Because you're a part of me.

40:28.585 --> 40:31.319
Well, uh, why, yes, I am.

40:31.337 --> 40:34.656
(stammers)
You haven't always, uh,

40:34.716 --> 40:38.468
appreciated that, but, uh...

40:38.620 --> 40:40.419
(sighs deeply)

40:40.522 --> 40:42.689
I'm coming to terms with it.

40:43.892 --> 40:45.942
And that's a good thing.

40:48.321 --> 40:50.262
Son, I-I'm...

40:50.323 --> 40:51.339
(door unlocks)

40:51.399 --> 40:52.782
Well...

40:52.975 --> 40:55.743
(stammers)
I'm-I'm speechless.

40:59.440 --> 41:02.000
It's not a good thing for you,
Dr. Whitly.

41:03.687 --> 41:08.256
See, I know you're there now.

41:09.676 --> 41:12.360
And I can lock you up.

41:12.420 --> 41:14.179
Tune you out.

41:15.849 --> 41:18.141
Even...

41:18.334 --> 41:20.351
leave you behind.

41:23.798 --> 41:25.540

41:25.600 --> 41:26.724

41:39.998 --> 41:41.831
You look troubled, Martin.

41:43.284 --> 41:45.001
Well...

41:45.787 --> 41:48.046
It's my son.

41:49.925 --> 41:52.199
It's been my mission these, uh,

41:52.219 --> 41:56.996
these many months
to-to shore up our bond.

41:57.057 --> 41:58.348
But...

41:59.851 --> 42:01.092
What, my son?

42:01.186 --> 42:03.686
My boy.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.671
He needs me now more than ever,

42:05.690 --> 42:07.857
and there is nothing
I can do in here,

42:08.050 --> 42:10.101
trapped behind these walls.
I've...

42:10.195 --> 42:11.435
(exhales)

42:11.530 --> 42:13.530
I gotta get out of here.

42:13.723 --> 42:15.406
I've got to be free.

42:17.869 --> 42:20.686
I have a Bible study,

42:20.747 --> 42:23.206
a service for the faithful

42:23.399 --> 42:25.449
who are interested in...

42:25.585 --> 42:27.210
Exodus.

42:31.073 --> 42:34.217
Perhaps you should join
our flock.

42:37.097 --> 42:38.680
Exodus.

42:42.452 --> 42:43.951
