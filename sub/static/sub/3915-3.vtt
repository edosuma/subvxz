00:00.024 --> 00:01.904
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Beauty & the Beast...

00:01.928 --> 00:03.298
Will you marry me?

00:03.299 --> 00:04.533
Yes.

00:04.568 --> 00:06.101
Are you sure things aren't
moving too quickly?

00:06.135 --> 00:09.271
<i>Getting engaged, moving in</i>
<i>together-- it's a lot.</i>

00:09.305 --> 00:10.745
<i>I've gone over</i>
<i>my medical records</i>

00:10.773 --> 00:12.207
<i>a dozen times.</i>
<i>There's no way</i>

00:12.241 --> 00:13.741
I should have survived that.
I should be dead.

00:13.776 --> 00:15.444
So what are you saying?
That the medicine

00:15.478 --> 00:17.980
they used on you made you
one of the experiments?

00:18.014 --> 00:20.115
In a world where science can
create beasts, you shouldn't be

00:20.149 --> 00:21.749
surprised to learn that there's
a lot worse things out there.

00:21.784 --> 00:24.619
Somehow, somebody is
getting innocents to do

00:24.653 --> 00:26.821
<i>extraordinary things, things</i>
<i>that nobody should be able</i>

00:26.856 --> 00:29.290
<i>to do, and we're the only ones</i>
<i>who know about it.</i>

00:29.324 --> 00:31.058
You'd better get back
to the hospital.

00:31.093 --> 00:32.058
Somebody shot Agent Thomas.

00:32.094 --> 00:34.896
He's dead.

00:44.939 --> 00:47.741
Please tell me that
you're not working late again.

00:47.775 --> 00:49.643
If you call me "honey,"
I'm gonna have to slap you.

00:49.677 --> 00:52.446
Tess. Sorry.
Um, can we talk tomorrow?

00:52.481 --> 00:55.649
I am trying to have
some alone time with Vincent,

00:55.683 --> 00:57.318
which has been rather difficult

00:57.352 --> 00:58.752
to come by these days.

00:58.786 --> 01:00.521
Oh, yeah?
Trouble in paradise, already,

01:00.555 --> 01:02.789
after two whole weeks
of living together?

01:02.824 --> 01:04.491
No, it's everything else.
I mean,

01:04.525 --> 01:06.660
between my job, his job,
planning a wedding,

01:06.694 --> 01:08.328
trying to figure out
who's turning innocents

01:08.362 --> 01:10.163
into superhuman experiments,

01:10.197 --> 01:12.198
there's not a lot of time
for us lately.

01:12.233 --> 01:13.800
Yeah, well, you wanted normal.

01:13.835 --> 01:15.335
This is not normal.

01:15.369 --> 01:16.769
I mean, maybe

01:16.803 --> 01:18.671
when we're both married
for 50 years

01:18.705 --> 01:20.306
and we're in walkers,

01:20.341 --> 01:23.209
but not yet, not tonight.

01:23.244 --> 01:26.479
All right, then, I guess I'll
wait to tell you what I found.

01:26.514 --> 01:28.515
No, no, no, no. Just give me
the <i>Reader's Digest</i> version.

01:28.549 --> 01:30.616
Anything to lighten
the load helps.

01:30.651 --> 01:33.152
Well, don't get your hopes up,
'cause, so far, it's a dead end.

01:33.186 --> 01:37.122
I interviewed doctors,
nurses, patients,

01:37.157 --> 01:38.791
checked surveillance cameras--
nada.

01:38.825 --> 01:40.459
There is no sign
of anyone entering

01:40.493 --> 01:41.961
or exiting Agent Thomas' room.

01:41.995 --> 01:43.529
No, that's impossible.

01:43.564 --> 01:46.532
He was shot and killed
in a locked hospital room.

01:46.567 --> 01:49.134
The only thing
I can think of is that...

01:49.169 --> 01:51.136
Another serum-enhanced
superhuman took him out,

01:51.171 --> 01:53.472
which means whoever's behind
this doesn't want us

01:53.506 --> 01:55.207
to know what Agent Thomas knew.

01:55.241 --> 01:56.475
Yeah, but still,
find the shooter,

01:56.509 --> 01:57.709
find the Big Bad, right?

01:57.743 --> 01:59.344
Right, okay, I'll meet you

01:59.379 --> 02:01.012
at the hospital,
maybe we missed something.

02:01.047 --> 02:02.548
No, no, no, no, stay home.

02:02.582 --> 02:05.050
Love your man tonight,
save the world tomorrow.

02:05.084 --> 02:06.918
Honey? Honey, I'm home.

02:06.953 --> 02:08.652
Wow.

02:08.687 --> 02:11.322
Sounds like you might be closer
to walkers than you think.

02:11.356 --> 02:14.693
Good-bye!

02:14.727 --> 02:16.561
Merlot?

02:16.596 --> 02:18.162
Oh, no, no, no.

02:18.197 --> 02:19.931
No, sorry, babe.
I'm beat.

02:19.966 --> 02:21.399
I need to be horizontal.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.734
Well, that works for me.

02:23.768 --> 02:26.237
You know, it's like
everybody in Manhattan

02:26.271 --> 02:28.506
decided to be
sick today.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.111
Mm. Sorry. You and, uh, Tess
make any progress

02:33.145 --> 02:34.778
on the Agent Thomas case?

02:34.813 --> 02:38.616
No, nope. No shop talk.
Okay.

02:38.650 --> 02:40.851
Not tonight. Just us talk.

02:40.885 --> 02:42.920
Okay, good, but if that includes
any wedding talk,

02:42.954 --> 02:44.287
then forget it,

02:44.322 --> 02:46.289
because I cannot look

02:46.324 --> 02:48.092
at any more brochures.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.627
No weddings, either.

02:49.661 --> 02:52.663
Just one thing
on the agenda tonight.

02:53.831 --> 02:55.465
Oh?

02:55.500 --> 02:57.634
Mmm.

02:57.668 --> 02:58.735
You.

02:58.769 --> 03:00.303
Mmm.

03:00.338 --> 03:01.938
Me.

03:01.972 --> 03:03.206
Mmm.

03:03.241 --> 03:06.075
Us.

03:06.110 --> 03:07.277
Us.

03:20.691 --> 03:22.091
He fell asleep?

03:22.126 --> 03:23.592
Yeah, he fell asleep.

03:23.627 --> 03:25.762
Yeah, well, you know,
guys tend to do that.

03:25.796 --> 03:27.963
Maybe after,
but not before.

03:27.997 --> 03:30.466
Oh. Oh, yeah,
that's bad.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.234
Yeah.

03:32.269 --> 03:34.069
I mean, in
fairness, though,

03:34.103 --> 03:36.672
it's hard for any couple
to juggle two careers

03:36.706 --> 03:38.440
and a relationship
in this crazy city.

03:38.475 --> 03:39.841
That's not the problem.

03:39.876 --> 03:41.577
It is everything else,
it's overwhelming.

03:41.611 --> 03:43.171
We need to get something
off our plates.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.612
Okay, all right.
So let's at least see

03:44.647 --> 03:46.148
what we can do about

03:46.182 --> 03:47.683
finding Agent Thomas' killer.

03:47.717 --> 03:49.484
Solving that'll help.
Yeah, I hope so.

03:49.518 --> 03:50.986
Sometimes I feel like

03:51.020 --> 03:52.587
I should've just left
well enough alone.

03:52.621 --> 03:54.923
You know? Things were
fine between us

03:54.957 --> 03:58.160
before I got us involved in
all this superhuman crap.

03:58.194 --> 04:01.829
Cat, you can't change
who you are, okay?

04:01.863 --> 04:03.764
You keep looking for
your greater purpose.

04:03.799 --> 04:06.434
- This could be it.
- Good morning, Captain.

04:06.468 --> 04:09.270
Captain. Uh, we're gonna
head back to the hospital.

04:09.305 --> 04:10.905
FYI, we're still
working the Thomas case.

04:10.906 --> 04:12.674
Didn't someone tell you?
Tell us what?

04:12.708 --> 04:13.988
Homeland Security's taking over.

04:14.009 --> 04:15.510
You two are off the case.

04:24.652 --> 04:25.820
Hello?

04:27.322 --> 04:30.157
Cat?

04:37.031 --> 04:38.332
What?

04:38.366 --> 04:39.899
Whoa!
Oh...

04:39.934 --> 04:41.468
Oh, you
scared me!

04:41.502 --> 04:43.637
Again.

04:45.172 --> 04:46.373
Didn't you hear me knock?

04:46.407 --> 04:47.641
No.

04:47.675 --> 04:49.475
I don't know.

04:49.509 --> 04:51.010
Wait, what...

04:51.045 --> 04:52.578
what time is it?
Where's Catherine?

04:52.613 --> 04:54.881
Well, I don't know,
I thought she was here.

04:54.915 --> 04:55.915
Oh, you guys got
in a fight, huh?

04:55.950 --> 04:57.717
No.

04:57.752 --> 04:59.385
Well, sleeping on the couch,
it happens.

04:59.419 --> 05:01.755
No, I just...
I just fell asleep on...

05:01.789 --> 05:04.423
Oh, no,
oh, no.

05:04.458 --> 05:07.727
Oh, man, I am such a jerk.

05:07.761 --> 05:09.528
I am such
a jerk!

05:09.563 --> 05:10.863
Oh, it's just too hard.

05:10.897 --> 05:12.732
What, living together?
No.

05:12.766 --> 05:15.934
No, no, that part
is the good part.

05:15.969 --> 05:17.737
Well, at least
it's supposed to be, anyway.

05:18.938 --> 05:21.006
I really should be talking

05:21.040 --> 05:22.407
to Catherine about this,
not you.

05:22.441 --> 05:24.542
Vincent, you can
talk to me.

05:24.577 --> 05:26.078
After all,

05:26.112 --> 05:28.346
I am going to be

05:28.381 --> 05:30.115
your sister-in-law someday,
right?

05:30.150 --> 05:31.430
No, no, Heather,
please, Heather,

05:31.450 --> 05:33.218
no more wedding stuff, okay?
What?

05:33.253 --> 05:36.188
We can barely breathe as it is.

05:36.222 --> 05:37.856
No, I know, Catherine told me
all about it, okay?

05:37.891 --> 05:39.724
That's why I'm here.
Vincent,

05:39.759 --> 05:42.294
I have the perfect solution.

05:42.328 --> 05:44.362
Just look.
Come on,

05:44.397 --> 05:46.564
it's your wedding,
not your funeral.

05:48.734 --> 05:50.435
<i>So I forwarded you the link</i>

05:50.469 --> 05:52.804
to the hospital's surveillance,
but doctors' statements,

05:52.838 --> 05:54.372
nurses, it's all
in the files.

05:54.407 --> 05:56.073
Were discharged
patients interviewed?

05:56.108 --> 05:57.308
I don't know.

05:57.342 --> 05:59.076
Ah, I was just
going to call you.

05:59.111 --> 06:01.078
Did you interview discharged patients?
Who wants to know?

06:01.113 --> 06:02.947
The Department of Homeland
Security wants to know.

06:02.981 --> 06:04.481
Agents Bob Hall,
Carol Hall,

06:04.516 --> 06:06.450
Detectives Chandler
and Vargas-- they were

06:06.484 --> 06:07.551
primary on the case.
<i>Are</i> primary

06:07.585 --> 06:09.420
on the case.
Look, Detectives,

06:09.454 --> 06:11.922
we're not looking to start a
jurisdictional fight here, okay?

06:11.956 --> 06:13.724
Neither are we. We'll let
you know what we find.

06:13.758 --> 06:15.225
But you haven't
found anything yet.

06:15.259 --> 06:17.394
It's early.
It's been two weeks.

06:17.429 --> 06:18.909
Which makes us
two weeks ahead of you.

06:22.534 --> 06:25.336
The victim was a federal agent.
One of ours.

06:25.370 --> 06:26.470
Right, but it happened
at New York General.

06:26.504 --> 06:28.271
Which makes it our jurisdiction.

06:28.306 --> 06:30.473
Look, Jack wasn't
just an agent, okay?

06:30.507 --> 06:32.309
He was a friend.
I'm sorry, but this is personal.

06:32.343 --> 06:33.310
Look, I don't know
what case

06:33.344 --> 06:35.145
he was working on
that got him killed,

06:35.179 --> 06:36.947
but I sure as hell intend to find out.
Look, we just want

06:36.981 --> 06:38.915
to catch whoever did this
to Jack and bring him in.

06:38.950 --> 06:39.717
That's it.

06:39.741 --> 06:41.351
But you don't know
what you're dealing with.

06:41.352 --> 06:43.392
What does that mean?
What do you know that we don't?

06:45.889 --> 06:49.425
Okay, well, if you can think
of anything that'll help,

06:49.460 --> 06:51.293
give us a call.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.695
Otherwise, DHS is
officially taking over.

06:52.730 --> 06:54.096
Captain.

06:57.534 --> 06:59.435
Just let it go, Chandler.

06:59.470 --> 07:01.871
Captaincy 101: know when you've been
out-jurisdictioned.

07:01.905 --> 07:04.306
And speaking of which,
why don't you use

07:04.341 --> 07:05.507
your newfound spare time
to drum up

07:05.541 --> 07:07.209
some support for
your final interview?

07:07.244 --> 07:09.711
Something to make you stand out
from the other candidates

07:09.746 --> 07:11.513
for captain.
Solving the murder of a federal agent

07:11.547 --> 07:13.747
will make her stand out.
Drop it, Chandler, it's over.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.220
You've got a shot
at captaincy, Tess.

07:19.255 --> 07:20.522
A legitimate one.

07:20.556 --> 07:21.790
Don't be stupid.

07:21.824 --> 07:23.157
Don't let her ruin this for you.

07:35.371 --> 07:36.704
Vincent?

08:00.395 --> 08:02.630
What's this?
Oh...

08:04.533 --> 08:05.733
To us.

08:05.767 --> 08:08.435
I will drink
to that.

08:08.469 --> 08:10.938
Please forgive me
for last night.

08:10.972 --> 08:12.605
I had no idea
how tired I was.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.574
No, it's okay,
I understand.

08:14.608 --> 08:16.910
Let's face it, we're
slammed, it's crazy.

08:16.945 --> 08:20.013
I had this fantasy
that moving in together

08:20.048 --> 08:22.582
would make things
easier for us, but...

08:22.616 --> 08:24.083
But it's not, is it?

08:24.117 --> 08:26.185
I mean, it's great,
I love it,

08:26.219 --> 08:28.287
but with everything
that's going on,

08:28.322 --> 08:30.590
I mean... there's no time
for us to enjoy <i>us.</i>

08:34.495 --> 08:36.395
Please forgive me.

08:36.429 --> 08:38.597
And please,

08:38.631 --> 08:40.532
please tell me there's
been some progress

08:40.567 --> 08:42.268
on finding Agent
Thomas' killer?

08:42.302 --> 08:45.537
No, and DHS took
us off the case.

08:45.572 --> 08:48.107
Homeland Security?
Really?

08:48.141 --> 08:49.375
But they got no idea
what's really going on.

08:49.409 --> 08:50.609
I mean, if they get too close...

08:50.643 --> 08:52.044
I know,
which is why

08:52.079 --> 08:53.812
I'm not really
dropping the case.

08:53.847 --> 08:55.481
For their sake
and for ours.

08:55.515 --> 08:57.483
We have to stop
whoever's behind this

08:57.517 --> 08:59.150
before someone
else gets hurt...

08:59.185 --> 09:02.120
and lighten our load
in the process.

09:02.154 --> 09:03.922
Well, I know one other way
we can do that.

09:06.025 --> 09:07.225
Oh?

09:10.196 --> 09:11.897
Heather's wedding binder?

09:11.931 --> 09:14.632
And now <i>our</i>
<i>wedding binder.</i>

09:14.666 --> 09:16.667
Okay, it was completely
your sister's idea,

09:16.702 --> 09:18.736
but I gotta say
I kind of like it, you know?

09:18.770 --> 09:21.973
She and her ex-fiancé, they...
they practically planned

09:22.008 --> 09:24.075
everything before they broke
up: I'm talking the venue,

09:24.110 --> 09:26.744
band, catering,
the-the frilly things.

09:26.778 --> 09:28.113
You know, all
the stuff that

09:28.147 --> 09:29.347
we're struggling
to have time to do?

09:29.382 --> 09:31.181
It's done. It's here.

09:31.216 --> 09:33.117
It's right here, it's done.
Yes.

09:33.151 --> 09:35.019
Yes, except for it is
Heather's idea of a wedding,

09:35.053 --> 09:36.787
which is pretty much
the opposite of mine.

09:36.822 --> 09:38.288
I know.
I know,

09:38.323 --> 09:39.690
and you don't have
to go through with it

09:39.725 --> 09:41.492
if you don't want to,
but... I mean,

09:41.527 --> 09:43.861
it's-it's
practically planned.

09:43.896 --> 09:46.163
All we have to do is
thin it out a little bit,

09:46.197 --> 09:47.631
and the best thing is,

09:47.665 --> 09:49.633
it's in six weeks' time.

09:49.667 --> 09:52.602
Which means in six weeks,

09:52.637 --> 09:55.372
we have one less overwhelming
thing to worry about.

09:55.407 --> 09:57.141
Yeah.

09:57.175 --> 09:59.231
Two, if you count saving
the city from evil.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.581
Get down!

10:19.345 --> 10:20.431
Anything?

10:20.456 --> 10:22.590
Yeah.
A bullet.

10:22.625 --> 10:24.459
Seven millimeter.

10:24.493 --> 10:27.128
I'll get this to Tess so JT
can analyze it in the morning.

10:27.162 --> 10:29.172
Same caliber that killed
Agent Thomas.

10:29.173 --> 10:31.374
Someone really doesn't
want you on this case, Cat.

10:31.409 --> 10:33.176
Any idea where the
shot came from?

10:33.210 --> 10:35.578
No, that's what concerns me.

10:35.612 --> 10:37.080
I heard what I thought
sounded like a ricochet,

10:37.114 --> 10:38.748
but I have no idea
what the bullet

10:38.782 --> 10:41.551
hit first
or where it even come from.

10:41.585 --> 10:43.319
That doesn't make any sense.
No, but neither does

10:43.354 --> 10:44.987
how they killed Agent Thomas.

10:45.022 --> 10:46.689
Well, even if this is another
superhuman experiment,

10:46.723 --> 10:48.491
there's got to be
some explanation.

10:48.526 --> 10:50.993
We got to get off this roof.
We're sitting ducks.

10:51.028 --> 10:52.562
Good news is, if someone's
trying to kill me,

10:52.596 --> 10:54.263
we're close to figuring
something out.

10:54.297 --> 10:56.432
No, the bad news is someone
is trying to kill you.

10:56.466 --> 10:58.568
We are moving to the houseboat.
Come on.

11:03.774 --> 11:05.274
<i>Something about this</i>
<i>doesn't make sense.</i>

11:05.308 --> 11:07.842
If the shooter had
superhuman eyesight

11:07.877 --> 11:09.411
or whatever,
why did he miss?

11:09.446 --> 11:11.180
What do you mean?

11:11.214 --> 11:13.382
I mean, if he's that good,

11:13.416 --> 11:15.016
and he wanted to kill me,

11:15.051 --> 11:16.618
why didn't he?
Uh...

11:16.652 --> 11:18.720
because I heard the shot,
and I saved you.

11:18.754 --> 11:19.955
At the risk of bruising

11:19.989 --> 11:21.123
your beastly ego--

11:21.157 --> 11:22.458
maybe you didn't.

11:22.492 --> 11:23.858
I'm just saying,
maybe someone's

11:23.894 --> 11:25.527
trying to scare
us off this case.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.395
If you kill a cop you're
only gonna attract

11:27.429 --> 11:28.563
more cops to investigate.

11:28.598 --> 11:29.965
Yeah, but none who can

11:29.999 --> 11:31.399
actually figure out
what's really going on,

11:31.433 --> 11:32.734
which is what we have to do

11:32.768 --> 11:34.268
if we hope to get us back.

11:34.303 --> 11:35.737
And back home.

11:35.771 --> 11:37.091
What? You don't like
my houseboat?

11:37.106 --> 11:38.773
Well...

11:38.808 --> 11:40.288
I do have a lot
of good memories here,

11:40.309 --> 11:41.642
but it's not where we live.

11:41.676 --> 11:42.876
Besides, I thought
you were gonna sell it.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.212
I am, I just...

11:44.246 --> 11:45.946
I haven't got
around to it yet.

11:45.981 --> 11:48.116
If you hadn't noticed,
I've been a little busy.

11:48.150 --> 11:49.984
You're not secretly
holding onto it

11:50.018 --> 11:51.552
as a safety net in case you
and me don't work out, are you?

11:51.587 --> 11:54.322
Well, then you'd better
hurry up and marry me.

11:54.356 --> 11:56.924
Lock me down,
eliminate all options.

11:56.958 --> 11:59.994
Six weeks too soon?

12:00.028 --> 12:01.762
You mean Heather's wedding?

12:01.796 --> 12:03.597
Are you serious?
Because I'm game

12:03.633 --> 12:05.166
if you're game.

12:05.199 --> 12:06.266
On one condition.

12:06.300 --> 12:07.801
No pink, no lace,

12:07.836 --> 12:09.436
and no frilly flowers.

12:09.470 --> 12:11.005
That's three conditions.

12:11.039 --> 12:13.906
Okay, but are you
sure about this?

12:13.941 --> 12:16.610
I'm sure I want to be your wife,

12:16.644 --> 12:18.111
and if this brings us
closer to that,

12:18.146 --> 12:19.179
then I'm in.

12:19.213 --> 12:20.913
Find out what normal looks

12:20.948 --> 12:22.249
like for us finally.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.983
Mmm.

12:24.018 --> 12:25.318
Mmm.

12:25.353 --> 12:28.655
Finally.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.214
Hey.

12:55.248 --> 12:56.348
Here's the bullet that

12:56.383 --> 12:57.650
Cat dug out of the roof.

12:57.684 --> 12:59.385
Great. Thanks.

12:59.419 --> 13:01.887
So, how you feeling?

13:01.921 --> 13:03.354
Me?
Yeah.

13:03.389 --> 13:04.856
Fine, great. Why?

13:04.891 --> 13:06.692
I was just wondering
if you were still,

13:06.726 --> 13:07.826
you know, worried.

13:07.860 --> 13:09.527
Worried about what?

13:09.562 --> 13:12.497
Oh, you mean about having
superpowers or something?

13:12.531 --> 13:14.332
Nah, please.

13:14.366 --> 13:15.533
I'm so over that.

13:15.568 --> 13:17.602
Okay.

13:21.073 --> 13:22.740
So, uh, how's Cat?

13:22.774 --> 13:25.243
She's not bad,

13:25.277 --> 13:26.877
considering someone's
trying to kill her.

13:26.912 --> 13:28.913
So, what else is new?

13:28.947 --> 13:31.516
I'm just saying it's
just like old times--

13:31.550 --> 13:33.751
mystery threats,
hiding from the Feds.

13:33.785 --> 13:35.720
Oh, I know, and I thought
we were past all that.

13:35.754 --> 13:38.422
It's too bad it's not a skill I
can put on my résumé, you know?

13:38.456 --> 13:39.990
Yeah.
What is this?

13:45.197 --> 13:46.731
"Electrokinesis.

13:46.765 --> 13:48.365
X-ray vision?"

13:48.399 --> 13:50.034
You liar. You are worried.

13:50.068 --> 13:52.703
Okay, maybe I am.
But wouldn't you be?

13:52.737 --> 13:55.672
Tess, I'm not being
paranoid, I swear.

13:55.707 --> 13:57.608
I'm just looking at
it scientifically,

13:57.642 --> 13:59.610
which means I can't
ignore the fact

13:59.644 --> 14:01.745
that the same serum that saved
me was the same exact strain

14:01.779 --> 14:03.447
found in the other victims.

14:03.481 --> 14:05.382
The other superhuman victims.

14:05.416 --> 14:06.516
Yes.

14:06.551 --> 14:08.684
Right. Come on.

14:08.719 --> 14:11.221
Look... maybe it'll turn out

14:11.255 --> 14:12.688
to be nothing, okay?

14:12.723 --> 14:14.724
And-and if so, great, fantastic.

14:14.759 --> 14:15.925
But if not,

14:15.960 --> 14:17.293
if there is something
in my blood,

14:17.327 --> 14:19.562
I need to know.

14:19.596 --> 14:21.330
I need to know.

14:23.834 --> 14:25.468
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

14:25.502 --> 14:27.570
You want to break into
Agent Thomas' room?

14:27.604 --> 14:30.939
Right now? While it's sealed
and DHS agents are all over it?

14:30.974 --> 14:33.976
I know, but JT just called to
confirm that the bullet that

14:34.010 --> 14:36.379
killed Agent Thomas came from
the same gun that shot at me,

14:36.413 --> 14:38.848
which tells us that
we're looking for one shooter.

14:38.849 --> 14:39.345
Yeah.

14:39.349 --> 14:41.616
One serum-enhanced shooter.

14:41.651 --> 14:45.053
Still, JT said
that both bullets had small,

14:45.088 --> 14:46.454
identical nicks on them.

14:46.489 --> 14:48.323
But the one that killed
Agent Thomas?

14:48.357 --> 14:49.958
It had trace amounts
of plastic on it.

14:49.993 --> 14:51.894
Which is why we have
to get back into that room

14:51.928 --> 14:53.262
and see what it might've hit.

14:53.296 --> 14:54.729
It could bring us closer
to the shooter.

14:54.764 --> 14:56.064
Catherine, come on,
those agents have been

14:56.099 --> 14:57.766
in and out of that
room all day long.

14:57.800 --> 14:58.966
Okay? They're here,
still, right now.

14:59.001 --> 15:00.067
If we get caught...

15:00.102 --> 15:01.002
We won't.

15:01.036 --> 15:02.270
Not if we do this together.

15:02.305 --> 15:03.672
We have been through
way worse than this.

15:03.706 --> 15:04.739
Yes, we have.

15:04.774 --> 15:06.174
But if we get caught,

15:06.208 --> 15:07.309
we both lose our jobs.

15:07.343 --> 15:08.410
And come on, I mean,

15:08.444 --> 15:09.611
I just started here.

15:09.645 --> 15:11.012
Okay, so,
what are you suggesting?

15:11.046 --> 15:12.647
That we let whoever
killed Agent Thomas

15:12.682 --> 15:14.015
get away with this,
as well as

15:14.049 --> 15:15.950
whoever's behind everything?

15:15.984 --> 15:18.286
No, I don't... Look.
I want to solve this

15:18.320 --> 15:20.254
as fast as you do,
okay? Believe me.

15:22.057 --> 15:23.590
Okay.

15:23.625 --> 15:26.294
All right, let's
make this quick.

15:29.898 --> 15:32.232
All right, come on. Hurry.

15:35.203 --> 15:36.537
Agent Thomas was shot
through the head,

15:36.571 --> 15:38.205
but there were no powder burns,

15:38.239 --> 15:39.540
so it couldn't have been
from close range.

15:39.574 --> 15:40.974
I still can't work out

15:41.008 --> 15:42.843
how the shooter got
in here undetected.

15:44.145 --> 15:46.012
Maybe he didn't.

15:48.582 --> 15:50.683
I think I figured out where
the plastic came from.

15:50.718 --> 15:53.320
That look like the size of a
seven millimeter to you?

15:53.354 --> 15:55.288
Definitely.

16:00.194 --> 16:01.928
Give me your flashlight.

16:07.768 --> 16:09.034
What is it?

16:09.069 --> 16:10.636
I'm not sure, but...

16:10.671 --> 16:13.473
it's starting to look
like the shooter was...

16:13.507 --> 16:15.508
outside.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.076
Shot through the window,

16:17.110 --> 16:18.845
and through the TV.

16:18.879 --> 16:20.913
But that's...

16:20.947 --> 16:22.081
Impossible.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.949
Yeah. Starting
to sound familiar.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.718
Freeze.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.755
Hands in the air.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.123
Now.

16:40.372 --> 16:42.954
I told you, Catherine. I told
you we were moving too fast.

16:42.955 --> 16:44.289
We should've waited.

16:44.323 --> 16:46.624
Until when, after the wedding?
Vincent!

16:46.659 --> 16:48.200
We're the only people
who know this is going on.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.657
You say yes, I say no...
Which makes us the only

16:49.681 --> 16:51.396
people who can stop it.

16:51.397 --> 16:53.964
I am screwed.

16:55.901 --> 16:58.102
Have a seat.

17:00.372 --> 17:01.972
You two

17:02.007 --> 17:04.040
are in a lot of trouble.
You know that, don't you?

17:04.076 --> 17:05.142
We were just following
up on a lead.

17:05.176 --> 17:07.344
On a case you're no longer on.

17:07.377 --> 17:08.979
To find a murderer.
Of one of our agents.

17:09.013 --> 17:10.681
I told you it's personal.

17:10.715 --> 17:11.715
Which makes me think you'd want

17:11.750 --> 17:12.893
as much help as possible.

17:12.894 --> 17:16.556
Catherine was shot at, so
it's personal for us now, too.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.935
I didn't realize we were
going to tell them that.

17:18.935 --> 17:20.277
I didn't realize we weren't.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.992
When did that happen?
Why didn't you tell us that before?

17:21.992 --> 17:23.792
Is that the lead
that you were following?

17:23.828 --> 17:25.194
No.
Yes.

17:25.230 --> 17:27.997
Are you two married
by any chance?

17:28.031 --> 17:29.399
Engaged.

17:31.068 --> 17:32.236
Is that funny?

17:32.270 --> 17:34.504
No, we just, uh, understand.

17:34.539 --> 17:36.573
We've been married
for six years.

17:36.608 --> 17:37.708
Working together for nine.

17:37.742 --> 17:39.308
It isn't easy, is it?

17:39.343 --> 17:41.077
We don't actually work together.

17:41.112 --> 17:43.847
Right, I was just helping
Catherine get into the room.

17:43.881 --> 17:45.715
He meant it's not easy
being engaged.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.583
It's a little overwhelming
sometimes, huh?

17:47.618 --> 17:48.818
Very.

17:51.222 --> 17:52.421
Look.

17:52.456 --> 17:54.157
Maybe we started

17:54.191 --> 17:55.758
off on the wrong foot here.

17:55.792 --> 17:57.025
It's obvious you want to solve

17:57.060 --> 17:58.427
this case as much as we do.

17:58.462 --> 18:00.263
Even after somebody
took a shot at you.

18:00.297 --> 18:01.597
Carol?
What?

18:01.632 --> 18:02.765
We need all the help

18:02.799 --> 18:05.167
we can get here.
And she's right.

18:05.201 --> 18:06.535
They've already been
on the case two weeks.

18:06.570 --> 18:08.404
We're gonna be
playing catch-up.

18:08.438 --> 18:09.572
Why not work together?

18:11.107 --> 18:14.777
All right.

18:14.811 --> 18:17.379
But we share all Intel,
you understand?

18:17.413 --> 18:19.014
You tell us everything you know.
The only thing I care about

18:19.048 --> 18:20.783
is catching Jack's killer.

18:20.817 --> 18:23.085
All right.
But we also work as a team.

18:23.119 --> 18:26.255
I mean, if she's catching fire,
then I'm not just doing rounds.

18:26.289 --> 18:27.609
How are you going
to help us, huh?

18:27.623 --> 18:29.056
You're a doctor.

18:29.091 --> 18:30.224
Oh, I can help.

18:30.259 --> 18:32.160
Trust me.

18:39.735 --> 18:41.102
Hey. What's going on?

18:41.136 --> 18:42.416
Looks like I'm back on the case.

18:42.438 --> 18:44.405
With the Feds?
But they don't know

18:44.439 --> 18:46.440
what's really happening with the whole...
That's right.

18:46.474 --> 18:47.741
And let's keep it that way
so they don't

18:47.776 --> 18:49.443
end up like Agent Thomas.

18:49.477 --> 18:51.045
Or find out about us.

18:51.079 --> 18:52.746
So much for lightening
your load.

18:52.781 --> 18:55.082
Thank you.

18:57.085 --> 18:58.986
We'll send forensics to Thomas'
hospital room to verify,

18:59.021 --> 19:00.954
but if they're right
about the bullet path...

19:00.988 --> 19:02.623
One hell of a shot.
No wonder we missed it.

19:02.657 --> 19:04.090
Sharpshooter.

19:04.125 --> 19:05.892
Probably for hire, ex-military.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.994
I'll have the office
pull up suspects.

19:08.029 --> 19:10.163
Is there a satellite
on the hospital?

19:10.198 --> 19:11.665
Uh, yeah, half-mile radius.

19:11.700 --> 19:12.766
Actually, you'd
better go a mile.

19:12.801 --> 19:13.967
Some of the best shooters

19:14.001 --> 19:15.836
have that kind of range.

19:15.870 --> 19:17.971
He used to be Special Forces.

19:18.005 --> 19:19.272
See, the problem is

19:19.307 --> 19:21.141
backtracking the path
of the bullet.

19:21.175 --> 19:23.509
It doesn't directly align
with any one of those buildings.

19:23.544 --> 19:24.811
Well, that's impossible.

19:24.846 --> 19:25.979
He had to take the
shot from somewhere.

19:26.013 --> 19:27.013
Which building's closest?

19:27.048 --> 19:28.114
Probably right here.

19:28.149 --> 19:30.851
That's the best possible angle.

19:30.885 --> 19:32.445
It's 15 East 23rd,
across from the park.

19:32.453 --> 19:34.554
Pull up the tenants.
Who lives there?

19:36.189 --> 19:38.090
Espinosa.

19:38.124 --> 19:40.526
Espinosa.
Julio Espinosa,

19:40.561 --> 19:41.861
drug kingpin.

19:41.895 --> 19:43.963
Weapons dealer,
scum of the earth.

19:43.997 --> 19:45.698
DHS has had him under
surveillance for years.

19:45.733 --> 19:48.100
But he's been all
but untouchable.

19:48.134 --> 19:49.635
He would do anything to protect
his criminal empire.

19:49.670 --> 19:51.036
It wouldn't be a stretch

19:51.071 --> 19:53.272
to think that
maybe he's behind...

19:53.306 --> 19:56.342
Behind what?
Behind Agent Thomas' killing.

19:56.376 --> 19:58.277
Look, if we're
gonna work together,

19:58.311 --> 20:00.012
you need to tell us
everything you know.

20:00.046 --> 20:02.381
First, let's figure out what
Espinosa has to do with this.

20:02.415 --> 20:03.448
How do we get in?

20:03.483 --> 20:04.483
It's not easy.

20:04.484 --> 20:05.817
His security's tight.

20:05.852 --> 20:06.885
And he doesn't take
any prisoners.

20:06.919 --> 20:09.654
What size shoes do you wear?

20:22.067 --> 20:23.834
Try and look like
you've done this before.

20:23.869 --> 20:25.069
Call girl?

20:25.104 --> 20:27.738
Nope. This'll be a first.

20:27.773 --> 20:28.973
It's the only way in.

20:29.008 --> 20:30.708
Espinosa loves his ladies.

20:30.742 --> 20:32.076
It's his Achilles' heel.

20:32.111 --> 20:34.078
Okay, just for the
record, I am not...

20:34.113 --> 20:35.646
Don't worry.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.815
Find the server room,
download the surveillance video.

20:37.849 --> 20:39.817
Find out who was here the
night Thomas was killed.

20:39.851 --> 20:41.184
And we're out of here.

20:41.219 --> 20:42.520
You make it sound so easy.

20:42.554 --> 20:44.855
Well, easier than being engaged.

20:55.033 --> 20:56.666
You're good, thanks, go ahead.

20:57.768 --> 20:59.502
We're in.

21:01.639 --> 21:03.440
Heading to the server room now.

21:03.474 --> 21:06.343
Thank God.
Yeah, still, a cop and a DHS agent?

21:06.377 --> 21:08.011
What happens if they
get caught in there?

21:08.046 --> 21:09.246
Then we storm the place.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.081
Don't worry.

21:11.115 --> 21:14.183
Nothing's gonna happen to your bride.

21:14.217 --> 21:17.386
What's going on?

21:17.421 --> 21:20.022
All right, look, I tried to
call you, but you didn't answer.

21:20.057 --> 21:22.024
We just, uh, we needed
a place to set up.

21:22.059 --> 21:24.761
Bob Hall. Thanks for letting us
use your place.

21:24.795 --> 21:26.896
Sure, no problem, Bob.

21:26.931 --> 21:28.932
We didn't want to compromise
any more of our agents,

21:28.966 --> 21:32.034
so we needed to set up
off-site, you know?

21:32.069 --> 21:33.602
Yeah, Bob is with
Homeland Security,

21:33.636 --> 21:35.604
and, uh, I'm helping him
out with, uh, the case

21:35.638 --> 21:37.773
that Catherine was telling
us about, remember?

21:37.807 --> 21:39.075
Oh, right.

21:39.109 --> 21:40.742
Yeah.

21:40.777 --> 21:43.446
Approaching server room,
armed guard at the door.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.914
You take him,
I'll take whoever's inside.

21:51.253 --> 21:52.921
Good job.
You, too.

21:52.956 --> 21:54.890
Ever think about
joining DHS?

21:54.924 --> 21:57.092
Lots of undercover,
good benefits.

21:57.126 --> 21:59.828
I think I've got enough
on my plate as it is.

21:59.863 --> 22:01.630
Look at this.

22:01.664 --> 22:04.065
We could have him arrested
for weapons charges alone.

22:04.100 --> 22:06.234
Oh, we can arrest him
for a whole lot more

22:06.268 --> 22:08.303
if we tie him to the shooting
of a federal agent.

22:08.337 --> 22:10.071
All right, I'll start
downloading surveillance.

22:10.106 --> 22:12.607
All right, I'll listen
out for trouble.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.983
Can't really tell
the two of them apart, huh?

22:23.018 --> 22:24.851
You guys pick a date yet?

22:24.886 --> 22:26.420
Yeah, uh, six weeks.

22:26.454 --> 22:28.422
From now?
Why the rush, huh?

22:30.225 --> 22:32.692
Sorry, none of my business.

22:32.727 --> 22:34.028
No, no, uh, it's okay.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.862
I can use all
the advice I can get.

22:35.897 --> 22:38.098
I've got eyes
on the hallway.

22:38.133 --> 22:39.432
Ugh.

22:39.466 --> 22:41.635
She's just going to keep
calling, you know.

22:41.669 --> 22:44.137
Okay, can you please,
please tell her, uh,

22:44.171 --> 22:45.371
I will call
her back later.

22:45.406 --> 22:46.506
I just, I
can't deal...

22:46.541 --> 22:49.142
Yes, sir.

22:49.176 --> 22:51.144
She's my, uh, my future
sister-in-law.

22:51.178 --> 22:53.046
She's sort of planning
the wedding for us.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.481
Good luck with that.

22:55.516 --> 22:57.283
Hey, Heather.
What, JT?

22:57.317 --> 22:59.552
Look, all I'm saying is,
there's a lot of pressure

22:59.586 --> 23:01.054
around weddings, you know?
Right.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.522
Hey, where's Vincent, okay?
I need to talk to him.

23:02.556 --> 23:03.989
Uh...

23:04.024 --> 23:05.391
He's busy, can he call you back?

23:05.426 --> 23:06.859
No, he can't call me back.

23:06.893 --> 23:09.362
You know, being
engaged is like a...

23:09.396 --> 23:13.131
it's like a test to see if you
can make it that far, you know?

23:13.166 --> 23:15.801
There's no short cuts, trust me.

23:15.835 --> 23:18.003
- How we doing, Cat?
- I'm working on it.

23:18.038 --> 23:20.639
I left all of these contracts at
the apartment for him to sign,

23:20.674 --> 23:22.240
but I can't get a hold of Cat
either, and if they don't sign

23:22.275 --> 23:23.876
them right away,
they're gonna ruin my wedding.

23:23.910 --> 23:25.210
Your wedding?

23:25.244 --> 23:27.680
Well, you know what I mean.

23:27.714 --> 23:30.815
Okay, well, they're staying
at the houseboat, so...

23:30.849 --> 23:32.417
What, the houseboat, why?

23:32.452 --> 23:34.419
Incoming.

23:34.454 --> 23:35.487
- Got to go.
- No, JT...

23:35.521 --> 23:36.988
We've got
a security breach.

23:37.022 --> 23:38.022
Look out!

23:38.057 --> 23:40.158
90 percent.

23:40.193 --> 23:41.193
That's good enough.

24:01.646 --> 24:03.280
Remind me never
to piss you off.

24:03.315 --> 24:04.955
Flash drive.
Leave it, we don't have time.

24:04.983 --> 24:07.017
No, we're not
leaving empty-handed.

24:07.051 --> 24:08.586
We don't have time.

24:12.790 --> 24:14.425
Let's go.

24:17.795 --> 24:19.362
Thanks, JT.

24:37.414 --> 24:38.581
Think you
were followed?

24:38.616 --> 24:39.616
No way.

24:39.617 --> 24:40.983
Not with Cat driving.

24:41.018 --> 24:42.818
Good.

24:42.853 --> 24:44.053
You okay?

24:44.087 --> 24:46.656
Yeah, actually,
that was fun.

24:46.690 --> 24:48.625
She kicked ass.

24:48.659 --> 24:50.260
Don't ever lose
that part of you.

24:50.294 --> 24:51.827
Especially
in a marriage.

24:51.862 --> 24:53.796
Flash drive?
We'll take it to DHS,

24:53.830 --> 24:56.265
see if they can I.D.
any of the suspects.

24:56.299 --> 24:58.267
Maybe we ought to take
a look at it first.

24:58.301 --> 25:01.303
Just so it's away from anyone
who may be looking for it.

25:03.439 --> 25:04.640
Okay.

25:04.675 --> 25:06.175
Let us know
what you find.

25:06.209 --> 25:07.643
Maybe then you'll
finally tell us

25:07.677 --> 25:09.117
what you really know
about this case.

25:14.317 --> 25:15.950
I like them. Wish
we could tell them.

25:15.985 --> 25:18.086
Yeah, me, too.

25:18.120 --> 25:19.754
But unfortunately, we
got to cut them loose

25:19.789 --> 25:21.756
as soon as we can before
they really do find out.

25:24.694 --> 25:26.260
Yeah, JT.

25:26.295 --> 25:27.996
Hey, buddy,
I need another favor.

25:42.678 --> 25:44.245
Aah...

25:46.715 --> 25:48.282
Aah...

25:59.274 --> 26:00.993
Fortunately the bullet
went right between

26:01.028 --> 26:02.995
your first and
second metacarpals,

26:03.030 --> 26:05.764
and just missed your radial
artery, too, buddy.

26:05.798 --> 26:08.434
You're lucky.
Yeah.

26:08.468 --> 26:11.002
Uh, nurse, could you got get me
10cc's of morphine, please?

26:11.037 --> 26:12.738
Again with the hospital?

26:12.772 --> 26:14.406
What's going on with you?

26:14.441 --> 26:15.441
Excuse me?

26:15.442 --> 26:16.842
I didn't shoot myself.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.844
I'm sorry, I'm just
worried about you.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.412
Is he gonna
be all right?

26:20.447 --> 26:22.614
Yeah, yeah, he should be
fine, it was a clean shot.

26:22.648 --> 26:25.583
It's just gonna take a long
time to heal, that's all.

26:25.618 --> 26:27.018
Seven mil, just like the rest,

26:27.053 --> 26:28.920
which means
whoever shot him

26:28.955 --> 26:30.321
wasn't going
for his hand.

26:30.356 --> 26:31.990
What do you mean?

26:32.024 --> 26:34.760
He was aiming for the flash
drive I was holding in my hand.

26:34.794 --> 26:37.928
Somebody is watching our every move.
And Bob and Carol's.

26:37.963 --> 26:40.798
She just told me someone broke
into their DHS office

26:40.832 --> 26:43.067
and tore the place apart
looking for that flash drive.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.703
I think we have to tell them.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.138
Tell them
what exactly?

26:47.172 --> 26:49.307
Everything.
You mean about beasts?

26:49.341 --> 26:51.008
No, we don't have to
tell them about that.

26:51.042 --> 26:53.778
But we should tell them
everything Agent Thomas knew

26:53.812 --> 26:55.312
about the experiments.
They deserve to know.

26:55.346 --> 26:57.514
Their lives are in
danger now, too.

26:57.548 --> 26:58.988
Catherine, this is
a huge risk, okay?

26:59.017 --> 27:00.550
This thing blows up
in our faces,

27:00.585 --> 27:02.385
our lives are gonna get
even more complicated.

27:16.668 --> 27:19.536
Finally. Where have
you two been?

27:19.570 --> 27:22.639
We have a wedding to plan.
What is all this?

27:22.674 --> 27:24.240
Well, what does it look like?
It's choices.

27:24.275 --> 27:25.709
This is not
a good time.

27:25.743 --> 27:26.843
We're in the middle
of something.

27:26.877 --> 27:28.812
We have people coming over.

27:28.846 --> 27:30.814
Okay, that's fine.

27:30.848 --> 27:33.416
Cat, the wedding is planned,
you don't have to worry.

27:33.450 --> 27:35.751
I just need for you
to make a few choices.

27:35.786 --> 27:37.720
I don't care--
you-you-you make the choices,

27:37.754 --> 27:38.688
the simpler the better.

27:38.722 --> 27:41.224
Simpler?
Mm-hmm.

27:42.693 --> 27:44.727
I didn't exactly plan
a simple wedding.

27:44.761 --> 27:46.895
But that's the only kind
of wedding <i>I</i> want.

27:50.367 --> 27:52.167
Right.

27:52.202 --> 27:54.036
Heath?

27:57.140 --> 28:00.108
I'm so sorry.

28:00.143 --> 28:02.544
I-I don't know
what I was thinking.

28:02.578 --> 28:04.546
You know what, don't...
don't worry about it.

28:04.580 --> 28:06.014
Heather.

28:06.049 --> 28:07.615
No, don't... don't
worry about it.

28:07.650 --> 28:08.750
What?

28:08.784 --> 28:09.885
Heather, wait.

28:13.256 --> 28:14.923
Catherine,
something's not right.

28:14.958 --> 28:17.058
Yes, clearly.
No, no, I don't mean about Heather.

28:17.092 --> 28:19.794
I mean about us confiding
in Bob and Carol.

28:19.829 --> 28:21.429
What do you mean?

28:21.464 --> 28:22.897
I don't know,
I got a feeling, you know?

28:22.931 --> 28:24.211
I just, I think
we made a mistake

28:24.233 --> 28:25.767
inviting them
over here.

28:25.801 --> 28:27.268
We shouldn't just rush
into these things

28:27.302 --> 28:28.570
without thinking
them through, right?

28:28.604 --> 28:31.038
There's too much at stake.

28:31.073 --> 28:34.041
Okay, I'll call them and cancel.

28:34.076 --> 28:35.709
Okay.

28:35.744 --> 28:38.412
It's voice mail-- they may
already be on their way.

28:38.446 --> 28:40.447
Ugh.

28:40.482 --> 28:42.149
Um, I'll find DHS main line.

28:42.184 --> 28:43.951
They'll probably have a way
to contact Bob and Carol.

28:43.986 --> 28:45.219
All right.

28:45.254 --> 28:47.221
That's coarse.

28:47.256 --> 28:48.489
That's fine.

28:48.523 --> 28:50.223
Just turn the knob.
Don't bark at me.

28:50.258 --> 28:52.459
I'm not!

28:52.494 --> 28:54.261
I-I'm sorry.

28:54.295 --> 28:57.264
I'm just frustrated I can't do
anything with this stupid hand.

28:57.298 --> 28:59.466
How do you think I feel? I'm
here trying to play scientist,

28:59.501 --> 29:01.341
when I really should be
trying to make captain.

29:02.169 --> 29:03.837
And you will.

29:03.872 --> 29:05.305
Now, adjust
the coax control...

29:05.339 --> 29:07.473
How will I?
How will I make it, huh?

29:07.508 --> 29:09.976
All the other candidates have
already put in their bona fides;

29:10.011 --> 29:11.611
I haven't even
started yet.

29:11.645 --> 29:13.245
I know, just...
Here, let me try.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.147
Know what? It doesn't even
matter because once Cat

29:15.181 --> 29:18.350
and Vincent spill the beans
on all this superhuman crap,

29:18.385 --> 29:21.420
you know I'm collateral
damage captaincy-wise.

29:21.454 --> 29:23.588
You sure this is the same
bullet that shot me?

29:23.623 --> 29:25.490
I mean, sure, I have
a good solve rate,

29:25.525 --> 29:27.092
but I spend most of my time
protecting beasts

29:27.127 --> 29:28.927
and chasing ghosts, so...
Tess.

29:28.961 --> 29:30.762
Didn't I say "Don't bark at me"?

29:30.797 --> 29:34.032
Is this the bullet that shot me?
Yes, why?

29:34.066 --> 29:37.001
Because it looks exactly
like the other two.

29:37.036 --> 29:39.604
Including having
the same nick mark in it.

29:39.639 --> 29:41.639
So what? We already know
it came from the same gun.

29:41.641 --> 29:42.641
It's not a barrel mark.

29:42.642 --> 29:43.809
The nick had
to have happened

29:43.843 --> 29:45.163
after the bullet
left the chamber.

29:47.079 --> 29:50.614
Almost as if another bullet
hit it in mid-flight.

29:51.650 --> 29:53.517
Okay, wait, wait, hold up.

29:53.552 --> 29:54.912
You're saying
there's two shooters.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.221
I know it sounds
crazy, but, yeah,

29:57.256 --> 29:58.456
it's the only logical
explanation.

29:58.490 --> 30:00.291
Come on,
are you sure, JT?

30:00.326 --> 30:02.693
One had to take the shot,
and the other had to...

30:02.727 --> 30:04.361
redirect it.

30:04.395 --> 30:06.029
Okay, well, that explains
the ricochet I heard

30:06.064 --> 30:07.665
and why no one
could work out

30:07.699 --> 30:09.299
the impossible angles
the shots came from.

30:09.334 --> 30:11.068
So, now you know you're
looking for two shooters

30:11.102 --> 30:12.169
instead of just one.

30:12.203 --> 30:14.137
Right.
I think we found them.

30:14.172 --> 30:16.406
Just got off the
phone with DHS.

30:16.441 --> 30:18.808
They don't have any agents
named Bob or Carol Hall.

30:18.843 --> 30:20.143
What? Okay, how'd we miss that?

30:20.178 --> 30:22.245
We didn't, Ward did.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.913
W-W-W-Wait. So, you're
saying they're the shooters?

30:23.948 --> 30:26.149
But they gave you Espinosa;
why would they do that?

30:26.184 --> 30:27.717
We were already
onto Espinosa's penthouse.

30:27.751 --> 30:29.252
If they hadn't
teamed up with us,

30:29.287 --> 30:31.321
we would have had access
to the flash drive anyway.

30:31.356 --> 30:34.691
So, they probably just wanted to
have control over what we found.

30:34.725 --> 30:36.926
And since they're coming here
right now, the question is--

30:36.961 --> 30:38.127
what do they want?

30:52.109 --> 30:53.709
It's too bad.

30:53.743 --> 30:55.344
I actually like them.

30:55.379 --> 30:58.714
Yeah, me, too.

30:58.748 --> 31:00.182
Still, we can't take
the risk they know

31:00.217 --> 31:01.217
about the experiments.

31:01.218 --> 31:02.851
So...

31:05.222 --> 31:07.823
Try one last time to find
out what Thomas told them.

31:09.258 --> 31:10.792
Then report back.

31:10.827 --> 31:14.195
Hard out, 10:30.

31:14.230 --> 31:16.164
Let's go.

31:22.071 --> 31:24.705
How can Bob and Carol
redirect a bullet in mid-flight

31:24.740 --> 31:26.107
and hit a target?

31:26.142 --> 31:27.875
What kind of experiment
can do that?

31:27.910 --> 31:30.311
Well, the only thing
I can think of is that somehow

31:30.346 --> 31:32.080
the serum speeds up
the brain's processing--

31:32.114 --> 31:33.314
you know, its, uh...

31:33.349 --> 31:35.050
its reflexes.

31:35.084 --> 31:37.085
It's like everything appears
in slow motion to them.

31:37.119 --> 31:39.887
So they can anticipate
what we're going to do

31:39.922 --> 31:41.722
before
we do it?

31:41.757 --> 31:43.157
How the hell
are we gonna stop that?

31:43.158 --> 31:45.059
I don't know.

31:48.630 --> 31:52.099
But... we're about to find out.

31:55.170 --> 31:56.470
Ready?
Yep.

31:56.504 --> 31:57.737
Okay.

31:57.772 --> 31:59.806
Hey!

31:59.840 --> 32:01.475
Hey.
Sorry we're late.

32:01.509 --> 32:03.444
We brought wine.

32:03.478 --> 32:05.612
Ah, perfect.

32:19.613 --> 32:20.846
It's a nice place.

32:20.881 --> 32:22.482
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks.

32:22.516 --> 32:24.750
Wedding planning in full swing, huh?
Yeah.

32:24.784 --> 32:26.585
Nothing is going to get
in the way of that.

32:26.620 --> 32:27.920
No. No.

32:27.954 --> 32:29.655
I admire that
about you, Cat.

32:29.689 --> 32:30.689
You're very...

32:30.690 --> 32:32.392
determined.

32:32.426 --> 32:34.360
Yeah, well, we
just have to get

32:34.395 --> 32:35.761
a couple of things
off our plates first.

32:35.795 --> 32:39.197
You know, make things
easier for us.

32:39.232 --> 32:40.566
Like solving
this case, huh?

32:40.600 --> 32:42.100
For starters.

32:42.135 --> 32:43.335
Yeah.

32:43.369 --> 32:45.103
So, what did you...

32:45.138 --> 32:46.818
what did you guys want
to talk to us about?

32:48.207 --> 32:49.909
Oh.

32:52.211 --> 32:54.179
Oh! It's Heather,

32:54.213 --> 32:55.580
my little sister.
Uh, we need

32:55.614 --> 32:58.050
to iron out some
wedding details.

32:58.084 --> 32:59.451
Just make yourselves at home.

32:59.485 --> 33:00.685
Be right back.

33:02.255 --> 33:03.455
Vincent.

33:03.489 --> 33:04.923
Hmm?

33:04.957 --> 33:06.958
She will need you for
this decision as well.

33:06.992 --> 33:08.793
Right. Excuse me.

33:16.301 --> 33:17.535
We've got eight minutes.

33:19.104 --> 33:21.439
We need to come up with a plan
and get them out of here.

33:21.473 --> 33:23.107
What, so they can take
another potshot at us?

33:23.141 --> 33:24.475
They're here right now, Vincent.

33:24.509 --> 33:25.709
It's our best chance
of figuring out

33:25.743 --> 33:27.311
who's behind all this.

33:27.345 --> 33:29.345
Catherine, if they can team up
to redirect bullets,

33:29.347 --> 33:30.781
they're not innocents who've
been experimented on, okay?

33:30.815 --> 33:32.283
They are assassins.

33:32.317 --> 33:33.584
You've seen how well
they work together.

33:33.618 --> 33:35.786
We work pretty well
together, too.

33:35.820 --> 33:37.088
If we want
to get back

33:37.122 --> 33:39.123
to focusing on us,
we have to get through them.

33:41.093 --> 33:42.813
Looking for a little
premarital advice, hmm?

33:47.465 --> 33:49.633
No, we have some other
questions for you.

33:49.667 --> 33:51.969
Like "who do you
really work for?"

33:52.003 --> 33:53.837
Because you're not DHS.

33:53.871 --> 33:55.305
Why'd you put us
through all this, huh?

33:55.339 --> 33:57.173
Shooting at
Catherine, JT,

33:57.208 --> 33:58.941
leading us
to Espinosa...

33:58.976 --> 34:00.410
Were you trying
to scare us off?

34:00.444 --> 34:01.944
Actually, it was Carol's idea.

34:01.979 --> 34:04.280
She saw your Achilles' heel
long before I did.

34:04.315 --> 34:07.417
Newly engaged, overwhelmed,
rushing things.

34:07.451 --> 34:10.686
We learned that the hard way.
It's not healthy.

34:10.721 --> 34:12.955
That's why we got past
Espinosa's security so easily.

34:12.989 --> 34:14.924
They knew you;
you'd been there before.

34:14.958 --> 34:17.259
Espinosa's
an old friend.

34:17.293 --> 34:19.929
He let me use his balcony
to start the shot on Thomas,

34:19.963 --> 34:21.362
and then Bob went ahead and...

34:21.397 --> 34:23.197
Redirected.

34:23.233 --> 34:25.635
We were worried that you might
spot me on the surveillance,

34:25.668 --> 34:28.402
which is why we had to...
shoot your friend.

34:30.206 --> 34:32.608
So... what did
Agent Thomas tell you, huh?

34:32.641 --> 34:35.143
How about you tell us who
you're working for first?

34:35.178 --> 34:36.612
Who's behind
these experiments?

34:36.646 --> 34:38.280
I think it's time for us to go.

34:38.313 --> 34:39.514
No, no, I don't
think so.

34:40.916 --> 34:42.717
Oh, you really think
you're gonna stop us?

34:42.752 --> 34:44.719
Well, in all fairness,

34:44.754 --> 34:46.155
this is when we're at our best.

34:48.056 --> 34:49.891
Hmm.

35:25.894 --> 35:27.460
Hyah!

35:30.732 --> 35:32.900
Now would be
a good time.

35:48.948 --> 35:49.948
Bob!

35:58.258 --> 35:59.898
Do you think they're
running away from us?

36:03.763 --> 36:04.763
No. Come on!

36:26.184 --> 36:28.286
You okay?
Yeah.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.591
Well, there goes
your safety net.

36:43.925 --> 36:46.359
Any sign of them?
No.

36:46.394 --> 36:48.495
Do you think that means that they're, uh...
No, I don't.

36:48.529 --> 36:50.030
I think they got away.

36:50.064 --> 36:51.431
God knows how.

36:51.465 --> 36:53.667
Which means they're
still gonna be after us.

36:53.701 --> 36:55.368
And maybe worse,
now that they know about you.

36:55.403 --> 36:57.671
Yeah, well, that's
a tomorrow problem.

36:57.705 --> 36:59.372
At least
they're gone.

36:59.407 --> 37:02.742
And so... is this.

37:02.777 --> 37:05.945
You think the universe
is trying to tell us something?

37:05.979 --> 37:07.379
Yeah.

37:07.414 --> 37:09.015
Don't rush the wedding?

37:09.049 --> 37:11.617
Yeah, if we can't find "us"
in our engagement,

37:11.651 --> 37:13.352
we certainly won't
in our marriage.

37:13.386 --> 37:15.121
Yeah, well, at least
we learned something

37:15.155 --> 37:16.388
from Bob and
Carol, right?

37:16.423 --> 37:17.743
Even though they
tried to kill us.

37:20.427 --> 37:22.428
Okay, you'd better go.
The last thing you need

37:22.462 --> 37:23.962
is to try and explain
what you're doing here.

37:23.996 --> 37:25.397
Right. Um...

37:25.432 --> 37:27.466
I'd go with "gas explosion."
Really?

37:27.500 --> 37:28.967
Really? You think the new
captain's gonna buy that?

37:29.001 --> 37:30.302
Yeah.

37:30.337 --> 37:32.003
In fact, I pretty much
guarantee it.

37:46.752 --> 37:48.086
I'm sorry, Detective Vargas.

37:48.120 --> 37:50.588
Even though you have
a stellar arrest record

37:50.622 --> 37:53.892
and solid candidacy
paperwork,

37:53.926 --> 37:55.894
you inexplicably do not have any letters
of recommendation.

37:55.928 --> 37:57.261
Why?

37:57.295 --> 37:58.496
I didn't have time.

37:58.530 --> 37:59.897
You didn't have time?

37:59.931 --> 38:01.666
No, I was busy on a case.

38:01.700 --> 38:03.234
I arrested Julio Espinosa.

38:05.203 --> 38:07.171
I got a tip,
I raided his penthouse

38:07.205 --> 38:09.841
and found a weapons cache,
including a grenade launcher.

38:09.875 --> 38:11.843
Now, it's not RICO,
but at least

38:11.877 --> 38:13.677
it'll keep him off
the streets for a while.

38:13.711 --> 38:14.912
The Feds are happy.

38:19.650 --> 38:21.218
That's my letter
of recommendation.

38:27.225 --> 38:28.926
Well, so much for all that
superhuman crap hurting you.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.660
Oh, I'm sure it'll bite me

38:30.695 --> 38:32.028
in the ass sooner or later.

38:32.062 --> 38:34.297
But, uh... not today.

38:34.331 --> 38:36.833
I wish I could see the look

38:36.868 --> 38:39.168
on your brothers' faces
when they find out.

38:39.203 --> 38:40.670
Oh, they totally
won't believe it.

38:40.705 --> 38:42.305
It's still a little hard
for me to believe.

38:42.339 --> 38:45.141
Believe it, Captain Vargas!

38:46.576 --> 38:47.944
I'm proud of you, Tess.

38:47.978 --> 38:49.445
Thanks.

38:49.479 --> 38:51.781
Hey, do you feel like
celebrating tonight?

38:51.815 --> 38:53.016
I mean, if you're up to it.

38:53.050 --> 38:54.850
No, I feel good, actually.

38:54.885 --> 38:57.220
Haven't even had
to take a painkiller.

38:57.254 --> 39:01.291
Really? Hey, maybe your
superpower's healing.

39:01.325 --> 39:02.658
Ha, ha, ha, very funny.

39:02.692 --> 39:04.192
I'll see you tonight, Captain.

39:04.227 --> 39:05.861
"Captain."

39:05.896 --> 39:07.430
I like the sound of that.

39:12.536 --> 39:13.736
Stop.

39:13.770 --> 39:16.505
No, no.

39:16.540 --> 39:17.807
Way to go.

39:17.841 --> 39:19.674
Captain.

39:37.460 --> 39:39.126
What?

39:46.134 --> 39:48.336
Your heart will heal, Heather,

39:48.370 --> 39:50.237
you just have to give it time.

39:50.272 --> 39:52.006
I mean, ending
an engagement

39:52.040 --> 39:54.675
isn't something that you
just get past overnight.

39:54.709 --> 39:58.612
Yeah, or by pawning off your
busted wedding on your sister.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.948
I don't know what
I was thinking.

40:00.983 --> 40:02.716
I guess I just
couldn't let it go.

40:02.750 --> 40:05.119
I'm so sorry.
You don't have to apologize.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.587
You were just trying
to help me out,

40:06.621 --> 40:07.855
lighten my load.

40:07.889 --> 40:10.023
While I avoid
dealing with mine.

40:10.057 --> 40:11.859
Getting
dumped sucks.

40:11.893 --> 40:16.096
Well, this is the problem
with quick engagements.

40:16.130 --> 40:17.764
You end up rushing
things before you know

40:17.799 --> 40:20.033
what you're getting into,
how to handle it all.

40:20.067 --> 40:22.369
Wait, are we talking
about me or you now?

40:22.403 --> 40:24.137
Both.

40:24.171 --> 40:25.905
Are you seriously worried
about you and Vincent?

40:25.939 --> 40:27.740
No, no, of
course not.

40:27.774 --> 40:29.742
It's just... it's
a lot to adjust to.

40:29.776 --> 40:31.244
It is so easy
to get lost

40:31.278 --> 40:32.745
in the craziness
of it all.

40:32.779 --> 40:34.414
We're just trying to
figure out how not to.

40:34.448 --> 40:37.050
But there are no short
cuts, that's for sure.

40:37.084 --> 40:39.419
We almost learned
that the hard way.

40:58.505 --> 41:00.605
Wait. What are
you doing?

41:00.640 --> 41:02.741
- What's it look like I'm doing?
- No, you can't!

41:02.775 --> 41:04.776
We might need her alive
to help us catch him.

41:04.810 --> 41:07.346
Look, this isn't just
a clean-up job anymore.

41:07.380 --> 41:08.813
This is about
saving our asses.

41:08.848 --> 41:11.283
We can't go back there
empty-handed.
