00:46.080 --> 00:50.642
And the fourth angel poured out his vial
upon the sun

00:50.800 --> 00:55.522
and power was given unto him
to scorch men with fire.

00:56.120 --> 00:59.966
And the fifth angel poured out his vial
upon the seat

01:00.120 --> 01:01.770
of the beast

01:02.760 --> 01:05.047
and his kingdom was full of darkness...

01:06.640 --> 01:08.847
No...

01:09.000 --> 01:12.482
The enemy is closer than you think.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.844
No! No!

01:16.000 --> 01:20.927
No! No! No! No! No!

01:26.160 --> 01:27.810
The King's doctor at once!

01:48.320 --> 01:53.167
<i>A' I'm the King of my own land,</i>

01:58.040 --> 02:01.408
<i>♪ Facing tempests of dust,</i>

02:01.560 --> 02:06.043
<i>♪ I'll fight until the end,</i>

02:10.240 --> 02:16.122
<i>♪ Creatures of my dreams
rise up and dance with me,</i>

02:24.680 --> 02:32.680
<i>♪ Now and forever
♪ I'm your King,</i>

03:06.040 --> 03:07.724
His humors are out of balance.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.051
Majesty, drink this
to help you sleep.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.009
It's a herbal cordial

03:16.160 --> 03:18.640
to allay your pain
and procure your rest.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.804
Laudanum, saffron
and bruised cloves.

03:22.880 --> 03:26.521
I beg you, heed the counsel
of your medical advisers.

03:32.440 --> 03:33.885
What do you say?

03:38.880 --> 03:40.405
Have you ever had a fever?

03:43.240 --> 03:44.651
I have, Your Majesty.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.370
What measures did you take?

03:49.800 --> 03:54.283
To permit my body to cure itself,
it was necessary to purge.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.807
There's a herb, sagewort.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.211
Known as sweet wormword.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.530
Fetch your remedy,

04:13.080 --> 04:15.731
but quickly and with a calm air.

04:17.760 --> 04:21.082
- No one must know of his condition.
- Sire.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.605
Love is in your future.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.562
Twice as much as you might think.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.449
I'm off to water the garden.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.285
I think that's a no.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.963
You did not respond to my last message.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.566
Well, to be perfectly honest

05:30.720 --> 05:33.326
it didn't seem pressing.
It was a busy week.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.769
Fail me again and your next piss
will be sitting down!

05:37.440 --> 05:40.444
You have my full attention.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.485
Read and follow...

05:47.920 --> 05:49.160
to the letter.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.685
Don't breathe.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.730
Were you raised in a cattle shed?
Why are you here?

06:23.880 --> 06:26.121
Come at once.
The King's Circle.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.844
Wake my wife. Do it now.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.247
What will you see
just before the end?

07:20.200 --> 07:21.929
The face of my enemy.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.001
I've always dreamed
the same dream.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.326
I'm in a great avenue
of evergreens,

07:35.880 --> 07:37.848
sitting in wet grass,

07:39.920 --> 07:42.764
gazing through the pine cones
at a canopy of sky.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.366
Then if I were you.
I would stay indoors.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.611
- Speak.
- The King's Circle.

08:10.160 --> 08:12.128
I must speak to you in private.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.567
You're still drunk. It can wait.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.529
But the gravity of my need...

08:16.680 --> 08:18.569
All needs of yours
weigh the same.

08:22.720 --> 08:26.361
A great tide is stirring.

08:27.440 --> 08:31.604
It pertains to your future,
your place at its center.

08:35.919 --> 08:36.919
Go to bed.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.006
Please.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.767
Philippa... Philippe!

08:48.760 --> 08:53.049
In the King's book of names,
you'll find a circle of trust,

08:53.200 --> 08:56.522
a list of those he believes in his heart

08:56.680 --> 09:00.002
are the most loyal, faithful
and true.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.601
Your names are on that list.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.288
An unbroken circle of trust.

09:07.680 --> 09:11.287
We all know here
what is at stake.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.331
How is my King?

09:15.120 --> 09:17.726
The fever is consuming him.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.250
Protocol now demands we begin work

09:21.400 --> 09:23.482
on the issue of succession.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.684
I will not hear it.

09:34.240 --> 09:38.006
He is stronger than a malady,
stronger than a hundred fevers.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.685
Not this one clearly.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.285
Your words are comforting.

09:41.440 --> 09:44.171
My King values expediency
over sympathy.

09:44.600 --> 09:49.049
As we hope for the best,
we must nevertheless plan for the worst.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.647
Where did this distemper
come from? Is it poison?

09:52.800 --> 09:54.802
I'll root out the cause.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.890
I hope you have more success.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
More?

09:59.240 --> 10:02.369
If a sick man gets to the King
I don't call it victory.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.769
The Dauphin is direct successor

10:04.920 --> 10:07.321
but would require a regent.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.768
I would argue a young King
requires a council of elders,

10:10.920 --> 10:12.843
with experience of government.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.321
Protocol's clear.
If the King...

10:15.480 --> 10:16.925
Do not say it.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.601
Dies,

10:22.840 --> 10:26.731
or if he is incapable
of exercising his duties,

10:26.880 --> 10:29.360
a regent shall be appointed.

10:29.760 --> 10:30.760
Who?

10:34.960 --> 10:36.724
That is the choice before us.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.766
What is the news?

10:44.920 --> 10:48.242
We did not see the King at mass
and you know people gossip.

10:49.080 --> 10:52.448
Hunting accident, broke his leg.
It will take weeks.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.768
Your Majesty, please!

10:54.920 --> 10:58.208
Rumors are flying around court.
The truth might stop them.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.931
Why such secrecy?

11:02.440 --> 11:04.283
So that rumors do not start.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.802
- What would happen if...
- No "if".

11:09.120 --> 11:10.360
He will be well.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.400
Yes,

11:15.280 --> 11:16.486
of course.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.041
Jezebel!

11:48.120 --> 11:49.804
- Delilah!
- Stop it!

11:54.080 --> 11:58.688
You may have shaved my seven locks
and sold me to the Philistines

11:59.200 --> 12:00.770
but I'm not yet on my knees.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.644
If the King's hair hurts
perhaps it was the wine.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.209
Eat the beast's fur
that bit you.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.522
But who wants fluff for breakfast?

12:46.680 --> 12:47.727
Was I out of turn?

12:49.600 --> 12:50.600
Come now!

12:51.520 --> 12:52.885
How is our King?

12:55.600 --> 12:58.331
Please speak.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.563
Why all the secrecy?

13:01.720 --> 13:03.006
Speak!

13:09.680 --> 13:11.170
You must vow to me.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.362
- On my father's life.
- He's dead.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.370
- My mother's?
- Forget it.

13:17.520 --> 13:20.091
I cannot help my tongue.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.930
Please! I see your distress
and it pains me.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.405
Allow me to share your burden.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.087
Speak!

13:36.240 --> 13:37.685
My brother is very sick.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.566
I always said
you'd make a marvelous King!

13:41.120 --> 13:42.120
Stop!

13:42.960 --> 13:46.203
So you're serious. Goodness!

13:46.640 --> 13:48.085
He is gravely ill.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.962
And if he were to die,
it might be possible

13:54.520 --> 13:55.851
that I will be regent.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.882
God in heaven! I had no idea.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.488
Not a word to anyone.

14:05.640 --> 14:09.440
This is a testing time
but I know with you by my side,

14:10.920 --> 14:13.844
- I can overcome anything.
- Hmm, yes,

14:14.800 --> 14:16.325
of course.

14:18.280 --> 14:21.682
Now, I must have air.
Come with me, please.

14:21.840 --> 14:25.128
I cannot. I have to, um, think.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.650
Very well.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.450
He is in my prayers

14:30.320 --> 14:31.560
as are YOU.

14:52.760 --> 14:53.966
What did you mean

14:54.120 --> 14:56.407
when you said
"a great tide is stirring?"

14:59.200 --> 15:00.200
Did I say that?

15:01.240 --> 15:02.241
Hmm!

15:03.080 --> 15:04.570
I must have been drunk.

16:29.440 --> 16:30.646
Father?

16:32.920 --> 16:33.920
Father!

16:45.760 --> 16:47.489
Help me! Please, he's dying.

16:49.480 --> 16:52.131
- What happened?
- I don't know.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.720
You must come.

16:59.720 --> 17:00.720
The King.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.805
He will perish.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.329
As will your King.

17:09.680 --> 17:13.082
Save your father or save France.
The choice is yours.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.044
- The King?
- He ordered my eyes to the door

17:29.720 --> 17:31.404
but he's not ordered them back.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.287
Stay here.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.522
Move. Move!

17:53.840 --> 17:54.966
Shut the doors.

18:00.440 --> 18:01.930
Close all the shutters.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.570
Door! Door!

18:21.040 --> 18:22.371
Ah, there you are.

18:22.520 --> 18:26.684
I can't decide if this will be
a courante a sarabande or a passacaille.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.611
You must return to bed.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.284
Your doctor is here.

18:31.680 --> 18:35.651
I've created a new dance, Bontemps,
and I wish my court to perform it.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.526
Very well, Sire.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.490
Everyone must learn it now.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.891
Bring me a pen and paper
and a gardener.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.844
- A gardener'?
- Yes, my gardener Jacques.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.924
He lost his hand in Malines.
Bring him here.

18:53.440 --> 18:55.841
I see this dance unfolding
in a garden,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.002
an orangerie full of blossom.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.440
I didn't see you
at our recent ballet.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.124
I dance as commanded by you.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.200
Then do so now.

19:11.360 --> 19:14.648
Dance for me now.
Follow me.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.410
First, a balancé. Twice going forward

19:20.200 --> 19:22.009
and then a pas De bourrée.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.084
Then another balancé going backwards,

19:27.240 --> 19:28.969
then another pas De bourée.

19:34.680 --> 19:38.366
If these are your steps, Sire,
then your dance is a passacaille.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.529
You're a man of quality
Bontemps.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.805
But I do not trust you,

19:53.320 --> 19:55.084
I do not trust you at all.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.289
- Sire...
- I do not know him!

19:58.440 --> 20:00.920
Your Majesty, please!

20:01.600 --> 20:03.648
Where is my gardener'?
I need him.

20:04.160 --> 20:07.528
Bring me Jacques! Guards!

20:07.680 --> 20:11.844
Please, bring me Jacques! Guards,
bring me Jacques! They mean to kill me!

20:12.080 --> 20:14.845
They mean to kill me! Bring me Jacques!

20:15.000 --> 20:16.809
Water for the King!

20:20.320 --> 20:22.846
My gardener will know what to do...

20:23.000 --> 20:27.170
Shh... Shh...

20:37.920 --> 20:39.888
His fever grows stronger.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.606
Your Majesty, the gardener.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.840
Tell me a story about my father.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.640
Your mother suckled him young
before you,

21:06.840 --> 21:09.207
which makes you milk brothers,
does it not?

21:14.640 --> 21:15.926
A story, then.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.689
Many years ago,

21:22.840 --> 21:26.447
an emissary from Japan
visited our shores.

21:27.560 --> 21:31.531
He brought a gift from China
for your father,

21:33.320 --> 21:36.881
an ancient text that he said

21:37.040 --> 21:40.840
that every general
in the emperor's army had read.

21:42.360 --> 21:46.843
The text was called the Art of War.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.683
So the story went
around the palace

21:52.440 --> 21:55.523
of this most vital maxim:

21:58.200 --> 22:01.010
"Appear weak when you are strong

22:01.760 --> 22:04.570
and strong when you are weak."

22:17.960 --> 22:18.960
Out.

22:23.440 --> 22:24.930
Out! Out!

23:49.960 --> 23:52.281
Yes, Madame De Clermont!

23:55.480 --> 23:56.641
Forgive me.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.603
I'd always assumed your office
was in the east wing.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.761
It is.

24:05.040 --> 24:08.283
As promised Monsieur Colbert,
our proof of noble heritage.

24:08.720 --> 24:09.801
Ah!

24:11.320 --> 24:14.847
- Good. I will review it in due course.
- Good day.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.881
We can't put his life
in a child's hands.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.565
Hardly a child.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.608
My brother should be in Paris.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.683
I have readied my own carriage.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.968
- I'll take him.
- He can't travel.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.846
- An hour at most.
- It may kill him.

24:54.480 --> 24:58.121
It is this palace that is killing him.

25:18.920 --> 25:22.402
I was just in the laundry,
I found this in one of the pockets.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.326
The same shapes
as you have in your book.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.006
Don't go anywhere.

25:36.440 --> 25:40.650
A meeting is planned for today.
Is my horse ready?

25:41.680 --> 25:44.524
- Fed and watered this morning!
- You've done well.

26:02.720 --> 26:06.930
- There's no one here!
- Yes, I noticed that myself.

26:27.560 --> 26:28.560
Cassel,

26:29.800 --> 26:32.121
we are risking our lives
being here.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.526
I had to conceal my horse
half a mile away.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.126
You're one to talk.
Why the urgency?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.161
You didn't write it?

26:57.240 --> 27:00.926
It appears we are not the only ones
bound by our intent.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.924
Which is what, exactly?

27:06.800 --> 27:08.040
Revolution.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.845
This is a monumental risk.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.525
What if these were
intercepted or deciphered?

27:17.680 --> 27:19.489
They have been deciphered.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.688
Then our location is known?

27:22.720 --> 27:25.803
Once a codex is broken
it offers opportunity.

27:25.960 --> 27:28.406
I wrote a new note,
made sure it was found.

27:28.960 --> 27:32.681
It proposes a rendezvous today
on the other side of Paris,

27:32.840 --> 27:34.410
so we are quite safe here.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.321
Cousin?

27:44.320 --> 27:46.402
A great moment is upon us:

27:46.560 --> 27:49.245
the King has a fever and
his sickness grows.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.969
We must plan quickly now
for our future.

27:53.640 --> 27:58.441
We have powerful and wealthy friends,
some already at court.

27:58.960 --> 28:02.089
Others, abroad,
are watching very closely,

28:02.240 --> 28:05.642
all of them standing, ready to help.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.087
A support message
from the Dutch Republic.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.206
A new captain general
is rising in power.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.567
William of Orange will be stadtholder

28:17.720 --> 28:19.882
commander of armies,
sea admiral.

28:20.040 --> 28:23.681
And he vows here to support
whoever moves against King Louis,

28:24.440 --> 28:25.885
not just with words,

28:26.480 --> 28:31.327
but with money, materials,
influence and arms.

28:32.680 --> 28:35.524
I've heard enough.
Thank you for the puppet show.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.409
Chevalier De Lorraine!

28:37.560 --> 28:41.281
Do not confuse the woman you have known
with the woman you see now.

28:41.440 --> 28:44.887
A gathering in Paris awaits you.
Canvas your supporters there.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.642
We know there are many.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.124
The fever has broken.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.046
The court mustn't know
about my condition.

30:09.680 --> 30:13.571
But surely
your brother must be informed.

30:13.720 --> 30:14.801
Close all the doors.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.205
Do it now.

30:59.160 --> 31:01.083
The issue of regent remains.

31:01.240 --> 31:03.368
We know your position, of course.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.730
Will no one vouch for me?

31:17.040 --> 31:20.487
It is not you who lacks merit,
Your Highness.

31:21.120 --> 31:24.363
Our concerns lie instead on those
who would be around you.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.241
Ah!

31:27.360 --> 31:28.964
Why not just say his name?

31:31.240 --> 31:34.403
We need someone whose behaviour
is more suited to a King,

31:34.960 --> 31:36.530
someone who is his own man.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.689
I hope I make myself clear.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.480
Perfectly.

31:45.560 --> 31:48.769
Her Majesty
and Monsieur Colbert would,

31:49.080 --> 31:53.244
to my mind,
ensure a resilient transition.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.011
Then it is settled.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.206
What are you doing?

32:38.480 --> 32:40.448
Rumors make me giddy.

32:41.280 --> 32:44.682
I'm going to Paris for a few days
to un-giddy myself.

32:51.040 --> 32:52.883
You said I'd make a great King.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.526
And you would.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.842
This is not idle chat.

33:00.840 --> 33:01.840
What is this?

33:05.200 --> 33:08.443
- You made a vow to me!
- And I kept it.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.768
Then be truthful in return.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.649
Have you been under a rock?

33:24.960 --> 33:26.849
We are on the verge of change.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.049
There are whispers growing louder
every day.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.009
People are tired of how it is.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.804
They wish to see change,

33:35.400 --> 33:38.847
one that would not deny the monarchy
but share in its burden.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.888
You can see it in your brother now.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.644
One man cannot rule the land.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.006
He's drowning in it,

33:49.840 --> 33:53.561
- and you can save him.
- You tread a dangerous path.

33:53.720 --> 33:57.520
The only danger is smelling smoke
and not acknowledging a fire.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.924
- You side with the nobles?
- I side with you

34:02.440 --> 34:04.363
just as the soldiers do.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.446
Would you side with me?

34:13.639 --> 34:17.485
- You cannot know what you're asking.
- I know what I'm asking.

34:20.280 --> 34:23.806
Until death forces my hand,

34:26.320 --> 34:27.525
I cannot answer.

34:30.480 --> 34:31.480
Very well.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.206
But know this:

34:35.320 --> 34:36.764
Our future has changed,

34:38.520 --> 34:40.010
no matter what happens now.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.280
My trunk!

34:52.760 --> 34:55.684
Sire, we rejoice at your recovery.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.728
Send tailors I want clothes.

35:00.480 --> 35:03.609
As for my court,
this is the message I want to convey.

35:27.400 --> 35:31.769
I am saddened to report
the King's health has not improved.

35:32.280 --> 35:35.489
He awakened before breakfast
and passed on instructions

35:35.640 --> 35:39.611
that government continue under his word.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.924
How can he make decisions
in such a condition?

35:43.080 --> 35:46.846
The King wishes France to be informed
immediately of his condition

35:47.600 --> 35:50.080
so they might offer their prayers.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.164
Has he said anything?

35:53.640 --> 35:54.801
He has...

35:57.960 --> 35:59.928
The court should learn
a new dance.

36:06.520 --> 36:07.520
A dance?

36:08.920 --> 36:13.369
It is one he has composed himself
in his moments of peace...

36:16.280 --> 36:18.123
to raise our spirits

36:19.240 --> 36:22.528
in anticipation of his recovery.

36:24.200 --> 36:28.489
Colbert, tell Monsieur Lully
to create a melody.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.329
Your sacrifice
won't be forgotten.

38:13.520 --> 38:15.761
My deep sympathy for your loss.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.326
I know now my replacement
for your father.

38:30.360 --> 38:31.566
What is his name?

38:33.760 --> 38:35.808
I know that he stands before me now.

38:39.560 --> 38:40.971
Many will oppose you,

38:41.960 --> 38:44.930
who would rather I chose
one of my physicians.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.768
Be deaf to their judgements.

38:51.280 --> 38:52.645
Will you accept the job?

38:54.280 --> 38:58.251
If the answer is yes
there is no going back.

38:59.520 --> 39:02.410
Your life as you know it
will be changed forever.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
I accept.

39:12.720 --> 39:13.960
Then it is yours.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.125
Medicine is a fine career.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.889
Get Mlle De la Valliére.

40:03.720 --> 40:06.246
Where's Chevalier?
I haven't seen him today.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.609
He rides to Paris.
A gathering of nobles.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.364
Does he indeed?

40:12.360 --> 40:13.566
What are you doing?

40:13.880 --> 40:15.291
Did you not hear?

40:16.200 --> 40:18.806
The King has a dance
and expects us to know it.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.643
- Why are you here?
- Getting Mme Rochefoucauld's letter.

41:22.920 --> 41:25.924
- This is her chamber?
- No, this is Mme De Clermont.

41:26.080 --> 41:28.845
Mme De la Rochefoucauld
is down the hallway.

41:29.840 --> 41:32.446
Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry!
Excuse me.

41:32.600 --> 41:33.600
Wait!

41:43.160 --> 41:44.969
I hoped you might stay here,

41:46.560 --> 41:48.483
you might think of this as home.

41:49.520 --> 41:50.601
I cannot.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.929
Not even for your children?

41:55.280 --> 41:58.250
For their sakes and for mine,

41:58.800 --> 42:01.246
I must show contrition for my life.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.041
You may go.

42:13.560 --> 42:16.450
Thank you,

42:17.880 --> 42:20.201
Majesty. Thank you with all my heart.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.807
Arrangements will be made.

42:39.240 --> 42:41.004
Mother, I have missed you.

42:41.160 --> 42:44.209
Every time I look for you,
I am rushed back to my lady.

42:44.360 --> 42:46.966
Your duty to me is to do well with her.

42:47.120 --> 42:48.884
Do not think of me at all.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.208
I found a chambermaid in your room.

42:52.840 --> 42:54.842
- Chambermaid?
- Yes.

42:55.160 --> 42:57.242
Looking for
Mme Rochefoucauld's letter

42:57.400 --> 42:59.209
but ended up in your room.

43:26.040 --> 43:27.405
I went to the chapel.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.050
Cassel was in conversation with
new nobles, Anjou, Poitier...

43:33.360 --> 43:35.681
- Who else?
- Mme De Clermont.

43:37.640 --> 43:40.883
Since the court
knew of the King's condition,

43:42.080 --> 43:45.641
conversations between these individuals
increased markedly.

43:45.800 --> 43:48.167
Anjou and Poitiers...

43:48.320 --> 43:51.130
too you say, both to Cassel.

43:54.960 --> 43:58.248
I asked the stables,
Potters, Anjou are riding to Paris.

44:00.440 --> 44:02.010
Not the only ones.

44:02.680 --> 44:05.923
Chevalier De Lorraine
also reached Paris this morning.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.847
- About Clermont...
- Later.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.560
Where are you going?

44:22.680 --> 44:24.205
<i>Christ Jesus,</i>

44:24.360 --> 44:27.569
life eternal in the bosom
of the Father...

44:30.160 --> 44:33.403
life of souls made of your own likeness,

44:34.960 --> 44:36.086
protect

44:37.520 --> 44:39.568
my brother in his time of need.

44:54.280 --> 44:55.280
My God!

44:58.880 --> 45:00.484
I was told you were dying!

45:01.720 --> 45:04.087
I was but then I recovered.

45:06.600 --> 45:08.921
- You didn't tell me?
- I told no one.

45:09.080 --> 45:10.445
Why?

45:10.600 --> 45:12.762
So I might see upon who I can depend.

45:14.920 --> 45:17.844
- You did not include me.
- I did not.

45:20.440 --> 45:24.206
- You do not trust your own brother?
- Not the company he keeps.

45:27.040 --> 45:29.247
Chevalier may seem blithe and glib,

45:30.520 --> 45:33.410
but he has a backbone.
I wish you saw what I do:

45:34.480 --> 45:35.811
He's a man of honor.

45:36.840 --> 45:40.128
You are blind to his failings
and dumb to his faults.

45:40.760 --> 45:42.489
Do not say such things.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.483
A conspiracy was uncovered,

45:45.000 --> 45:47.571
nobles plotting against me
as I am ill in bed.

45:48.880 --> 45:50.848
Chevalier is a ring leader.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.002
All of them will be arrested.

45:53.680 --> 45:54.727
Impossible.

45:55.800 --> 45:57.928
- He's no conspirator.
- Very true.

45:58.320 --> 46:02.245
He's a traitor
and will be treated as such.

46:29.720 --> 46:30.720
To Versailles!

46:32.120 --> 46:33.167
Good idea.

46:48.840 --> 46:51.889
The Duc D'Orléans will have
your head for this for sure.

46:53.160 --> 46:56.960
When your neck's
on the block you know what he will say?

46:58.120 --> 46:59.360
No.

47:03.960 --> 47:05.371
In any case,

47:06.160 --> 47:08.049
I hope you're fond of horses.

48:12.080 --> 48:14.890
Burn in hell you Catholic cunt.

49:11.680 --> 49:14.047
I found a little something
to aid us.

49:16.280 --> 49:17.964
Aid us with what?

49:19.000 --> 49:22.129
Endurance. A love potion.

49:22.920 --> 49:25.526
When I look at you
I need nothing else.

49:25.680 --> 49:27.444
Oh, I'm the same.

49:28.680 --> 49:30.569
But I think it might be fun.

49:40.080 --> 49:41.080
Come.

53:43.440 --> 53:44.771
Thank you.

54:00.160 --> 54:05.160
Ha! Ha!-
