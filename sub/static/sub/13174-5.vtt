00:00.817 --> 00:02.550
Previously on "Wrecked"...

00:02.575 --> 00:04.484
It's the community pile. I saved it,

00:04.509 --> 00:05.821
and now everyone thinks it's gone.

00:05.846 --> 00:08.026
- What are they fighting over?
- Airline pretzels.

00:08.052 --> 00:09.847
- The only food we have left.
- Will you marry me?

00:09.872 --> 00:11.411
- No.
- Why not?

00:11.436 --> 00:12.771
Because you lied to me, Todd.

00:12.796 --> 00:14.247
And you stole the camp's stuff.

00:14.272 --> 00:15.957
- Whatever, dude.
- Where's our stuff?!

00:15.982 --> 00:18.085
It's all gone! I hid it.

00:18.110 --> 00:23.866
From now on,
I'm the friggin' king of the island!

00:25.123 --> 00:27.486
Come on, Steve. Be strong. Yeah.

00:27.511 --> 00:30.498
"See the world," they said. [Chuckles]

00:30.523 --> 00:32.259
I should never have left Papakura.

00:32.665 --> 00:35.634
Oh, dear! Aah!

00:35.659 --> 00:38.879
Okay, Todd, can I get
that toothbrush now?

00:38.904 --> 00:40.771
You look a little short there, Legs.

00:40.796 --> 00:42.032
You said three nuts!

00:42.056 --> 00:44.602
Oh, yeah, that was before tax.

00:44.628 --> 00:45.915
Now it's four.

00:45.940 --> 00:47.059
Come on, Todd!

00:47.125 --> 00:50.058
My mouth tastes like
a... homeless foot!

00:50.082 --> 00:53.125
You don't like it, go find a Rite-Aid!

00:53.150 --> 00:56.306
I think there's one, like,
a thousand miles that way.

00:56.331 --> 00:57.677
All right, I'll get you another nut!

00:57.703 --> 01:01.226
Of course, now there's also
my handling fee and gratuity.

01:01.251 --> 01:03.369
So why don't you throw in that hat.

01:03.393 --> 01:06.941
But my head is so small.
It will never fit you.

01:06.966 --> 01:08.824
Maybe I'll wipe my ass with it.

01:08.849 --> 01:10.276
It's getting a little chaffed.

01:10.301 --> 01:11.678
[Sighs]

01:11.703 --> 01:15.301
â™ª

01:15.326 --> 01:17.126
There you go.

01:19.491 --> 01:20.947
This is criminal.

01:20.972 --> 01:22.616
Nah, it's within the law.

01:22.641 --> 01:24.130
[Grunts]

01:24.155 --> 01:26.955
The Todd law.

01:26.980 --> 01:28.425
[Laughs]

01:28.450 --> 01:30.060
Go get it!

01:30.275 --> 01:32.942
So that's included in the extra nuts?

01:32.967 --> 01:33.795
No.

- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -

01:37.223 --> 01:39.779
Just look at him,
hoarding all of our stuff like that.

01:39.803 --> 01:41.969
Todd's unleashed a lot of bad juju.

01:41.994 --> 01:43.088
People are getting desperate.

01:43.113 --> 01:44.248
Yeah, if we're gonna be living here,

01:44.274 --> 01:45.925
we need some basic
rules and regulations.

01:45.950 --> 01:47.856
I just wish there was a way to
get the stuff back from Todd.

01:47.881 --> 01:49.351
I mean...  We could bum-rush him,

01:49.376 --> 01:51.638
take back our stuff with good,
old American force.

01:51.663 --> 01:53.631
We can't. He's got all of
our stuff hidden somewhere

01:53.656 --> 01:54.726
like some kind of rat.

01:54.751 --> 01:56.028
- Danny!
- Hey, guys.

01:56.053 --> 01:57.103
How can I be of service?

01:57.128 --> 01:59.168
You're a cop. Can't you make Todd

01:59.192 --> 02:01.235
give us all our stuff back with your...

02:01.773 --> 02:04.864
Emma, are you suggesting I use
my weapon for intimidation?

02:04.889 --> 02:06.190
Because I would never...

02:06.214 --> 02:07.606
What the hell do you want?

02:07.631 --> 02:09.640
For you to give up the goods, Todd.

02:11.411 --> 02:12.875
Are you threatening me, dude?

02:12.900 --> 02:14.186
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

02:14.211 --> 02:16.751
Hey! Hey, police brutality!

02:16.776 --> 02:18.006
- Danny's gonna shoot me!
- Shh!

02:18.031 --> 02:18.832
No, no, no, no, no!

02:18.857 --> 02:20.976
I can't believe you
would even consider that.

02:21.001 --> 02:22.681
[Scoffs] Civilians.

02:22.706 --> 02:24.316
Karen: Daniel, why
don't you do a stakeout?

02:24.341 --> 02:26.775
Tail him till he leads you to the stash.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.220
A stakeout, brilliant.
Why didn't I think of that?

02:29.245 --> 02:30.483
I could kiss you right now.

02:30.508 --> 02:31.729
- Do it.
- What?

02:31.754 --> 02:33.889
- Do it. Kiss me on the mouth.
- Oh, no, thank you.

02:33.914 --> 02:35.101
Come on. Come right on in.

02:35.126 --> 02:36.066
That's not what I was implying.

02:36.091 --> 02:37.653
You're not coming to
me, I'm coming to you.

02:37.679 --> 02:38.864
- Oh, oh.
- How about this?

02:38.889 --> 02:40.800
Is this close enough to get you enticed?

02:40.825 --> 02:42.937
- Uh, I'm... I'm not... Ohh.
- What about this?

02:42.962 --> 02:45.024
If you want to use your tongue,
I'm not gonna complain.

02:45.049 --> 02:47.474
Okay, I think I'm gonna
go do the stakeout,

02:47.498 --> 02:48.695
if you guys don't mind.

02:48.721 --> 02:52.897
But rest assured,
Todd's gonna lead me right to the stash.

02:52.921 --> 02:54.456
[Chuckles]

02:54.481 --> 02:56.481
[Sea gulls crying]

03:00.066 --> 03:02.485
My, my, my.

03:03.129 --> 03:05.859
Sure it hot out here, isn't it...

03:07.295 --> 03:08.746
Daniel?

03:11.077 --> 03:13.375
Reveal yourself!

03:14.861 --> 03:17.813
Hello, Todd.

03:18.603 --> 03:22.110
I applaud the effort,
but I smelled your beard sweat

03:22.135 --> 03:23.634
from a hundred yards out.

03:24.548 --> 03:28.001
So, what did you think?
I was just gonna slip up

03:28.026 --> 03:29.991
and let you follow me to the stuff?

03:30.016 --> 03:31.230
No.

03:31.255 --> 03:32.667
[Chuckles]

03:32.692 --> 03:34.839
Hilarious.

03:34.865 --> 03:38.267
But I'm not showing you Jimmy Jack Corn.

03:38.515 --> 03:41.421
Yeah. Well, we'll see about that.

03:41.446 --> 03:43.119
We'll see, all right.

03:43.283 --> 03:45.258
Yeah, we totally will.

03:45.283 --> 03:48.108
Or will we not?

03:48.371 --> 03:50.512
[Stammers] Maybe we won't.

03:50.537 --> 03:51.827
So you're saying we won't?

03:51.852 --> 03:53.072
Yeah.

03:53.132 --> 03:54.970
God damn it, get out of my head, man!

03:54.995 --> 03:56.659
- Whoo!
- Damn it!

03:56.684 --> 03:59.247
You're weak in here.

03:59.272 --> 04:00.489
[Wheezing]

04:00.514 --> 04:02.028
Okay, Yolonzo, where is your inhaler?

04:02.053 --> 04:03.501
Hmm?

04:03.526 --> 04:06.304
Yolonzo, donde esta Tu inhaler?

04:06.972 --> 04:08.734
The Todd.

04:08.759 --> 04:12.139
He made me pay to use.

04:12.164 --> 04:15.809
I give him two sunscreens.

04:15.834 --> 04:18.125
It's not enough.

04:18.149 --> 04:19.535
[Panting]

04:19.560 --> 04:23.594
We are his prisoners!

04:23.819 --> 04:27.851
["Prisoners" echoing]

04:27.876 --> 04:29.262
No, you guys, hear me out.

04:29.287 --> 04:30.771
What if we dug a giant pit?

04:30.796 --> 04:33.046
And make it deep enough so
that nobody can crawl out.

04:33.071 --> 04:35.274
We can throw Todd in there until
he gives us all of our stuff back.

04:35.298 --> 04:37.717
- Pit justice, I like it.
- Yes, finally.

04:37.742 --> 04:39.202
I've been trying to do
that to Todd for years.

04:39.228 --> 04:41.483
No, no, no, no.
What you're talking about is a prison.

04:41.507 --> 04:43.065
Yeah, Flo, face the facts.

04:43.090 --> 04:44.356
Todd took all of our stuff,

04:44.381 --> 04:46.014
and a giant pit is how we get it back.

04:46.108 --> 04:48.075
I mean, come on, you guys.
People are dying here.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.068
Que?!

04:49.093 --> 04:51.210
Pit justice. I'm with Emma.

04:51.235 --> 04:51.782
[Thud] Mm.

04:51.807 --> 04:54.052
You're talking about
putting a man in a hole.

04:54.077 --> 04:56.559
That is a basic human-rights violation.

04:56.584 --> 04:59.010
Ha! Can you guys tell she almost
minored in political science?

04:59.034 --> 04:59.762
Oh!

04:59.787 --> 05:01.128
Okay, for this pit,
what are we thinking?

05:01.153 --> 05:02.272
Beach, jungle?

05:02.297 --> 05:03.671
Who made you leader?

05:03.834 --> 05:06.193
Well, no one is really stepping up here.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.730
Yeah, I think we need an election.

05:07.756 --> 05:10.354
It would be nice for someone
to set some ground rules here.

05:10.379 --> 05:12.784
I just wish there was some
sort of natural leader,

05:12.809 --> 05:14.435
like a lawyer or a doctor.

05:14.460 --> 05:16.275
Turd, I am a doctor!

05:16.300 --> 05:18.714
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah. You know what?

05:18.739 --> 05:20.330
I nominate myself, okay?

05:20.355 --> 05:22.489
I, Emma, nominate myself for leader.

05:22.514 --> 05:25.149
Good, so we can turn
this majestic island

05:25.174 --> 05:27.404
into a North Korean prison state.

05:27.429 --> 05:28.697
I nominate myself.

05:28.722 --> 05:30.092
Florence, come on.
Do you really want to go there?

05:30.117 --> 05:32.832
Oh, I already went there,
and it's friggin' paradise.

05:32.857 --> 05:34.688
That's a good platform.

05:34.713 --> 05:38.382
Oh, electi-o-o-on!!

05:42.941 --> 05:44.480
So, what are we thinking for this pit?

05:44.505 --> 05:45.949
Eight feet, nine feet?

05:46.171 --> 05:47.871
Hell, why don't we just round up to 10?

05:47.896 --> 05:50.782
I like your style, Emma.
You don't pull punches.

05:50.807 --> 05:53.431
The world needs more
dragon bitches like us.

05:53.456 --> 05:55.872
I wouldn't call myself a dragon bitch.
Maybe...

05:55.897 --> 05:57.797
And I'd love to be a
part of your campaign.

05:57.876 --> 05:59.820
Put that black-market
bastard in this hole!

05:59.845 --> 06:02.428
Okay. Uh, well, I can use
all the help I could get.

06:02.453 --> 06:03.577
So welcome aboard.

06:03.602 --> 06:04.995
Now let's cut the shit and get to work.

06:05.020 --> 06:06.773
The election's tonight,
and your hippy-dippy friend

Hi. Emma. Can I count
on your vote tonight?

06:15.691 --> 06:17.950
I'm gonna hold you to it.
Gonna hold you to it.

06:17.975 --> 06:20.262
We're family. And family's got to hug.

06:20.287 --> 06:21.273
- Oh.
- Yeah.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.735
Flo is the way to go.

06:22.760 --> 06:25.305
Finally! Someone who understands
the value of the pit.

06:25.330 --> 06:27.784
Oh, yeah.
I can't wait to get Todd in that pit.

06:27.809 --> 06:29.256
- Yeah.
- Start torturing him.

06:29.281 --> 06:30.235
Uh, no.

06:30.260 --> 06:31.809
We're not torturing anyone here.

06:31.834 --> 06:33.220
Oh, right.

06:33.245 --> 06:34.862
We're not torturing anyone here.

06:34.887 --> 06:37.178
We're gonna Guantanamo it. That's smart.

06:37.204 --> 06:38.470
No, still not what I'm saying.

06:38.495 --> 06:39.865
No, no, no, I get what you're saying.

06:39.890 --> 06:42.734
I read you five-by-five.
No torture here whatsoever!

06:42.759 --> 06:44.500
- Yes.
- Wink.

06:44.595 --> 06:47.281
Emma wants to throw Todd in a
prison for taking our stuff.

06:47.306 --> 06:50.191
But isn't having the
stuff the real prison?

06:50.335 --> 06:51.447
[Imitates explosion]

06:51.472 --> 06:53.675
If you don't vote for Emma,
you can go [bleep] yourself.

All right, Margaret, see you tonight.

06:56.543 --> 07:00.213
Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick...

07:00.238 --> 07:03.016
Ahh. You're not gonna wait me out, pal.

07:03.041 --> 07:04.625
I'm not going back to the stuff.

07:04.650 --> 07:08.765
At some point, you're gonna need
food or water or toilet paper.

07:08.790 --> 07:10.508
Oh, will I?

07:10.533 --> 07:13.039
'Cause you happen to
be talking to the guy

07:13.064 --> 07:15.852
that used to shit his pants for laughs.

07:15.876 --> 07:16.938
That's right.

07:16.963 --> 07:20.072
In my fraternity, my
nickname was Streaks.

07:20.171 --> 07:21.603
Pbht!

07:21.628 --> 07:25.278
Right. Jess told me you
guys met at some frat party.

07:25.303 --> 07:26.753
[Scoffs]

07:27.072 --> 07:28.605
Did she now?

07:28.630 --> 07:30.598
You guys were together since college.

07:30.623 --> 07:32.141
That's a pretty long time.

07:32.166 --> 07:33.876
I see what you're doing.

07:34.046 --> 07:37.784
Get me talking about Jess
and her perfect ta-tas

07:37.809 --> 07:39.442
so I break down and cry and shit.

07:39.467 --> 07:44.603
Well, good luck, pal,
'cause I'm a Goddamn rock.

07:47.042 --> 07:49.510
And it wasn't some frat party.

07:49.932 --> 07:51.391
Oh, yeah?

07:51.496 --> 07:55.135
It was the fraternity party of the year.

Me and the other boys of Beta Gamma Phi

were having our annual
Cowboys and Indians party,

08:01.108 --> 08:04.112
the most legendary party on campus.

08:04.136 --> 08:07.281
I was in the keg corner,
crushing a stand.

08:07.306 --> 08:10.848
Oh, yeah!

I am a god!

08:46.082 --> 08:47.830
Hey, thanks.

08:47.855 --> 08:50.562
I'm the wrong Indian.

08:50.911 --> 08:52.110
Cute.

08:52.135 --> 08:54.739
- You a freshman?
- Yeah, just turned 18.

08:54.764 --> 08:55.804
You a senior?

08:55.829 --> 08:56.963
Fifth year.

08:56.988 --> 08:58.454
Cool.

08:58.490 --> 09:01.581
Later that night, we banged.

09:01.606 --> 09:03.631
[Both moaning]

09:04.808 --> 09:07.066
Tale as old as time.

09:07.091 --> 09:09.060
[Retches]

09:09.520 --> 09:13.288
Yeah. We hooked up for,
like, two years after that.

09:13.313 --> 09:15.213
Been officially together for seven.

09:15.238 --> 09:17.404
Well, we were.

09:17.429 --> 09:20.396
Hey, it's not too late to get Jess back.

09:20.421 --> 09:22.943
You just got to show
us where the stuff is.

09:24.874 --> 09:28.542
No! I know what you're doing,
playing your mind games.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.928
Well, you can eat a butt and go to hell.

09:30.953 --> 09:32.946
You know what? This ends right now.

09:33.252 --> 09:35.650
We're gonna settle this
the fraternity way...

09:35.794 --> 09:37.424
Like gentlemen.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.185
Classic drink-off.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.594
You win, I give you back all the stuff.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.164
I win...

09:47.719 --> 09:51.586
you leave me alone and I get your gun.

09:52.907 --> 09:56.156
That's right, your baby.

09:56.436 --> 09:59.288
Come on, Danny boy.
You want to be a hero, don't you?

09:59.717 --> 10:01.377
What do you say?

10:01.996 --> 10:04.224
Let's have a little drinky, drinky.

10:04.249 --> 10:07.168
â™ª

10:07.491 --> 10:09.136
I did a little informal polling.

10:09.161 --> 10:09.621
Okay.

10:09.646 --> 10:11.445
There's about a dozen
people who are pro-pit.

10:11.470 --> 10:12.781
You'll definitely get those votes.

10:12.806 --> 10:13.584
Okay, great.

10:13.609 --> 10:15.180
But Florence has about double that.

10:15.205 --> 10:16.339
Wait, how?

10:16.364 --> 10:17.662
Well, she doesn't offer any solutions,

10:17.687 --> 10:19.930
but people like her,
and the voters find you,

10:19.955 --> 10:22.192
well, smug and condescending.

10:22.253 --> 10:24.622
Condescending? Really?
They find me condescending?

10:24.647 --> 10:26.325
Idiots.

10:26.350 --> 10:27.625
This is why Hillary struggles.

10:27.650 --> 10:28.750
You know, people are afraid

10:28.776 --> 10:30.797
of a smart, strong, independent woman.

10:30.822 --> 10:32.475
Yeah, I hear you, sister.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.998
You, me, Hillary, we're all the same.

10:35.023 --> 10:37.135
It's like looking in a friggin' mirror.

10:37.642 --> 10:40.309
Okay, you know what?
Florence isn't even saying anything.

10:40.334 --> 10:41.633
You know, she's all just like...

10:41.658 --> 10:43.643
[Imitating Florence]
"One world, one love."

10:43.668 --> 10:44.835
I can't lose.

10:44.860 --> 10:47.761
Okay, I don't lose,
especially not to Florence.

10:47.786 --> 10:49.074
Well, I hate to tell you,

10:49.100 --> 10:50.750
you're probably gonna have to pander.

10:50.775 --> 10:51.874
Dumb it down a little.

10:51.899 --> 10:53.589
No, I'm not gonna dumb it down.

10:56.331 --> 10:58.056
What if we got a Nader?

10:58.081 --> 11:00.418
You know, like some
wild-card third party

11:00.443 --> 11:01.753
that could split up the old idiot vote.

11:01.778 --> 11:04.008
Yes! A likable dummy.

11:04.033 --> 11:05.464
- Mm-hmm.
- But who?

11:05.489 --> 11:07.418
Steve: You know,
I've always been a hit with the birds.

11:07.527 --> 11:10.899
Oh! Oh, I guess Polly wants a ginger!

11:12.122 --> 11:13.946
[Laughs] Hi, Emma!

11:13.971 --> 11:16.500
â™ª

11:19.350 --> 11:20.603
What if it was Steve?

11:20.629 --> 11:22.657
Yep, that's what that look was for.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.815
Mm-hmm.

11:30.754 --> 11:32.254
Karen: Hey.

11:32.289 --> 11:33.922
Hey. I don't know about you,

11:33.957 --> 11:35.824
but this food's getting a bit "boaring."

11:35.859 --> 11:37.151
I acknowledge your pun.

11:37.176 --> 11:38.152
Look, Steve, there's something

11:38.177 --> 11:39.581
I'd like to talk to you about.

11:39.606 --> 11:40.421
Okay.

11:40.446 --> 11:42.117
I think you should
run for island leader.

11:42.142 --> 11:45.146
[Giggles] Oh! That's rich, Karen.

11:45.171 --> 11:46.269
Thanks for the chortle.

11:46.294 --> 11:48.258
Steve, do I look like I'm joking?

11:49.537 --> 11:51.096
No.

11:51.201 --> 11:53.353
[Sighs] But me?

11:53.378 --> 11:55.423
Run against Florence and Emma?

11:55.448 --> 11:57.049
People don't listen to me.

11:57.074 --> 11:58.869
These people would.
Everyone here likes you.

11:58.895 --> 12:01.075
You have a very nonthreatening face.

12:01.100 --> 12:04.418
Well, thank you. It's almost kind.

12:04.616 --> 12:06.234
I don't know.

12:07.006 --> 12:09.463
I've never been in a position of power.

12:09.489 --> 12:12.275
The way I see it, people think of me

12:12.299 --> 12:14.602
as some kind of a joke, you know?

12:14.627 --> 12:18.629
Steve, here, we could be different.

12:19.057 --> 12:20.890
What do you want to be?

12:21.322 --> 12:24.028
â™ª

12:24.053 --> 12:25.315
The rules are simple.

12:25.688 --> 12:28.502
First one to pass out,
shit their pants, or puke loses.

12:28.527 --> 12:31.409
- [Bottle slides]
- We got shot for shot.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.388
Shot for shot?

12:33.413 --> 12:35.114
Shot for shot!

12:35.139 --> 12:37.594
All right, then shut
up, and let's drink!

12:37.872 --> 12:39.232
So it begins.

12:39.257 --> 12:40.714
[Applause]

12:40.738 --> 12:42.452
Before we begin tonight,

12:42.477 --> 12:45.453
I would like to announce
that we have a new candidate.

12:45.479 --> 12:46.682
Steve!

12:46.707 --> 12:48.144
- Yeah!
- [Cheering]

12:48.335 --> 12:50.107
- Steve!
- Thank you.

12:50.132 --> 12:50.785
Yeah!

12:50.810 --> 12:54.122
Hello, Wembley! Two, two... is this on?

12:54.147 --> 12:55.373
[Laughter]

12:55.398 --> 12:58.533
It's not really a microphone,
just a bit of mime there.

12:58.856 --> 13:00.511
[Cap clatters] Nice.

13:00.536 --> 13:02.314
â™ª

13:03.449 --> 13:05.495
- Oh! That's good!
- [Coughs]

13:05.520 --> 13:06.738
That was great.

13:06.770 --> 13:08.470
- The first one is hard.
- I'm cool, man.

13:08.495 --> 13:10.160
I'm cool as a fan right now.

13:10.185 --> 13:11.615
I grew up on this stuff.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.537
My housekeeper was Mexican.
Her name was Carlita.

13:14.562 --> 13:16.462
She used to make it in a mop bucket.

13:16.486 --> 13:20.322
Yeah, well, my dad worked in finance,
80 hours a week.

13:20.347 --> 13:22.480
And he had a smoking-hot secretary,

13:22.505 --> 13:26.382
so, yeah, my mom had a full bar.

13:26.832 --> 13:29.555
Missy, you don't want to
throw someone in the pit,

13:29.580 --> 13:31.468
then how do you want to deal with crime?

13:31.493 --> 13:35.052
Through rehabilitation,
not incarceration.

13:35.077 --> 13:36.724
So, what are you saying?

13:36.749 --> 13:40.834
I'm not saying anything.
I'm just trying to listen.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.303
I guess I never thought
of it like that before.

13:43.328 --> 13:46.274
[Cheers and applause]

13:48.109 --> 13:49.840
- What is that, eight?
- [Scoffs]

13:49.865 --> 13:51.346
[Both laugh]

13:51.371 --> 13:53.447
I'm not even feeling it!

13:54.507 --> 13:57.179
- Did you shit yourself?
- I haven't shit myself yet.

13:58.591 --> 14:00.178
- Right out of the bottle.
- All right.

14:00.203 --> 14:01.084
Shot for shot.

14:01.109 --> 14:03.025
Welcome to the wonderful
world of herpes.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.955
[Laughing] I already have 'em.

14:04.980 --> 14:07.207
Oh, what's that? You want another shot?

14:07.232 --> 14:08.788
Yes, please.

14:08.813 --> 14:11.264
[Both screaming]

14:11.289 --> 14:13.405
[Laughing] Ooh!

14:13.730 --> 14:15.934
Are you into Phish?

14:16.060 --> 14:17.622
Yeah. Me too.

14:17.647 --> 14:20.328
Emma, is there a limit to how long Todd

14:20.353 --> 14:23.366
will have to stay in the pit and,
if so, will you reconsider?

14:23.391 --> 14:26.970
If I could call upon my medical
training for an analogy...

14:29.356 --> 14:34.196
uh, Todd's gonorrhea,
and we got to stop the burning.

14:34.221 --> 14:36.770
[Cheers and applause]

14:36.795 --> 14:39.929
â™ª

14:40.378 --> 14:42.343
[Gasps]

14:44.749 --> 14:46.759
Whoa!

14:46.784 --> 14:48.874
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

14:48.899 --> 14:52.102
I thought you were down,
and you're back up, man!

14:52.127 --> 14:53.460
You know what?

14:53.484 --> 14:55.581
You're cool, man. You're a cool guy.

14:55.607 --> 14:57.263
You're a cool guy, man.

14:57.288 --> 14:59.857
[Both laughing]

15:00.947 --> 15:02.620
I got a nickname for you.

15:02.645 --> 15:04.068
- You ready?
- Yeah.

15:04.093 --> 15:05.226
Chumbawamba.

15:05.251 --> 15:06.348
I love it, man.

15:06.373 --> 15:09.618
But... but also, like...  why?

15:09.643 --> 15:13.320
Because you get knocked down, then...

15:13.363 --> 15:16.224
you always get back up again.

15:16.986 --> 15:20.060
That's like the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me, man.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.023
You don't have a lot of friends,
do you, Chumba?

15:22.048 --> 15:24.882
I do, but I just don't know if,
like, they're friends

15:24.907 --> 15:28.609
with me because of me
or because of my money.

15:28.790 --> 15:30.547
What, are you a billionaire?

15:30.580 --> 15:32.030
Yeah.

15:32.055 --> 15:33.745
I'm a billionaire.

15:33.877 --> 15:35.648
I'm a billionaire, man.

15:35.673 --> 15:36.667
[Both laughing]

15:36.692 --> 15:39.867
I'm trying to make a
billionaire shit his pants!

15:39.891 --> 15:40.953
[Laughs]

15:40.978 --> 15:42.978
â™ª

15:45.632 --> 15:47.850
I'm voting for Emma mainly because she's

15:47.875 --> 15:50.293
the only one that wants
to throw Todd into a hole.

15:50.318 --> 15:53.141
Well, my vote's for Steve.
The guy's voice cracks me up.

15:53.166 --> 15:53.875
He's all like...

15:53.900 --> 15:54.930
[Imitating Steve] "Oh, cup of tea."

15:54.955 --> 15:57.634
And I like the idea of the pit,
but a lady as a leader?

15:57.914 --> 15:59.489
Not in my America.

15:59.514 --> 16:00.793
My vote is for Florence

16:00.818 --> 16:04.291
because she's the only one
who actually calls me Kurt.

16:04.316 --> 16:06.182
Oh, just hand me the ballot, Turdhole!

16:06.207 --> 16:08.491
I don't know why you people
keep saying shit out loud.

16:08.517 --> 16:09.783
Sorry. Sorry.

16:09.808 --> 16:14.439
â™ª 'Cause you're my
little baby bird â™ª

16:14.975 --> 16:16.689
That's all I have.

16:20.449 --> 16:23.217
â™ª

16:25.785 --> 16:28.417
You lose, lightweight.

16:34.385 --> 16:36.295
Streaks!

16:36.320 --> 16:39.661
[Grunts]

16:40.790 --> 16:43.424
Ah.

16:43.449 --> 16:44.871
Ahh.

16:44.896 --> 16:47.477
Worth the wait.

16:49.730 --> 16:53.166
As a notary public from
the great state of Ohio,

16:53.191 --> 16:54.965
I have counted all the votes.

16:54.990 --> 16:57.857
And the new leader of the island is...

16:57.882 --> 17:00.671
â™ª

17:01.695 --> 17:03.318
Steve!

17:03.343 --> 17:05.126
- What?
- [Cheering]

17:05.151 --> 17:07.214
- Oh, wow!
- Who's a winner?!

17:07.239 --> 17:08.618
Yeah, okay, so, no, sorry.

17:08.644 --> 17:09.887
[Chuckles] I demand a recount.

17:09.912 --> 17:11.511
Oh, no, honey, he won.

17:11.536 --> 17:13.631
You don't think we saw
you two running around,

17:13.656 --> 17:14.492
throwing shade?

17:14.518 --> 17:15.934
You crazy bitches did not help yourself.

17:15.959 --> 17:17.260
Are you people kidding me?

17:17.285 --> 17:18.448
I mean, I am a doctor!

17:18.473 --> 17:19.750
I'm the only doctor on the island.

17:19.775 --> 17:21.407
This is just some likeable dummy!

17:21.433 --> 17:23.143
I mean, he wouldn't even be
running if it wasn't for me.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.300
[Laughs]

17:24.359 --> 17:26.271
Hold on. You asked him to run?

17:26.297 --> 17:27.815
- What?
- Oh, no, no.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.068
Actually, it was Karen.

17:29.093 --> 17:31.065
- Oh. Why?
- Thank you.

17:31.090 --> 17:32.557
Uh...

17:34.179 --> 17:36.173
Because...

17:36.492 --> 17:39.177
Ah, screw this!

17:39.250 --> 17:42.459
Because Emma and me wanted
to split the idiot vote.

17:42.484 --> 17:44.671
There, I said it!

17:44.696 --> 17:47.497
And if you didn't vote for Emma,
then you're a moron!

17:47.522 --> 17:48.835
That's the truth.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.158
[Booing]

17:50.183 --> 17:51.349
[Chuckles]

17:51.374 --> 17:53.725
You'd rather cheat than lose to me?

17:53.749 --> 17:55.583
No, Florence. You're right.

17:55.608 --> 17:59.009
I am a moron... for being
friends with you for this long.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.540
Florence...

18:00.565 --> 18:03.705
You're gonna love San Francisco...

18:04.019 --> 18:06.998
if you ever make it there.

18:07.023 --> 18:08.232
Yeah, well...

18:08.257 --> 18:11.440
I'm sure you will like it,
'cause you're a snooty bitch!

18:11.465 --> 18:14.370
- What?
- I hope you choke on sourdough.

18:14.395 --> 18:15.404
- Yep.
- She's a celiac!

18:15.429 --> 18:17.022
Feed her bread whenever you want!

18:17.047 --> 18:19.831
Okay. It's a digestive issue. [Chuckles]

18:20.022 --> 18:23.017
What's up, losers? What's all this?

18:23.042 --> 18:25.844
I think you mean what's all this?

18:25.869 --> 18:26.632
[Thud]

18:26.657 --> 18:27.514
[All gasping]

18:27.539 --> 18:29.214
- God damn.
- Whoa.

18:29.239 --> 18:31.755
Todd's stash, I found it.

18:32.089 --> 18:35.004
Chalk that up to classic police work.

18:35.029 --> 18:36.542
[Cheering]

18:36.567 --> 18:40.045
â™ª

18:46.721 --> 18:49.171
Captain Danny solves the crime...

18:49.247 --> 18:50.543
every time.

18:50.567 --> 18:53.631
What the hell, Chumba?!

18:53.656 --> 18:55.428
You were down for the count.

18:55.453 --> 18:56.944
Yeah, well, here's a funny story.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.131
You lose, lightweight.

18:59.156 --> 19:02.811
The only people that drink
more than frat guys...

19:02.835 --> 19:04.132
Worth the wait.

19:04.158 --> 19:06.367
Are the super lonely...

19:07.388 --> 19:09.388
which I am.

19:09.413 --> 19:12.217
[Chuckles] Well...

19:12.242 --> 19:14.982
You forgot I still have the gun!

19:15.007 --> 19:17.539
What?! Yeah!

19:17.564 --> 19:20.621
Good luck firing that gun...

19:20.646 --> 19:23.151
without any of these.

19:23.176 --> 19:25.278
- [Bullets clatter]
- Oh, the bullets. No.

19:25.303 --> 19:26.259
- [Gun clicking]
- Yep.

19:26.284 --> 19:27.705
Damn it, damn it!

19:27.730 --> 19:29.589
You think I was gonna keep a loaded gun

19:29.614 --> 19:30.995
next to my dick and balls?

19:31.021 --> 19:32.870
[Cheering] Yeah, balls!

19:32.894 --> 19:35.612
Whatever. You guys had
crappy stuff anyway.

19:35.637 --> 19:37.844
What's up, Jess?

19:38.874 --> 19:41.518
What are we gonna do about you?

19:41.543 --> 19:44.925
Oh, look who's Mr. Tough Guy now.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.416
You guys elected him?

19:46.441 --> 19:48.936
He's the biggest joke on the island!

19:48.960 --> 19:50.242
Let's dig that pit!

19:50.267 --> 19:51.726
[Cheering]

19:51.751 --> 19:53.336
Uh, we got the stuff.
We don't need a pit.

19:53.362 --> 19:54.423
I think we do.

19:54.447 --> 19:56.949
We can't have a society without
"lawr" and order.

19:56.973 --> 19:57.509
"Lawr."

19:57.535 --> 19:59.382
And this guy's got to do his time.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.137
So I say...

20:01.843 --> 20:03.470
â™ª

20:03.495 --> 20:05.281
- Throw him in the pit!
- [Thud]

20:05.306 --> 20:06.991
[Cheering]

20:07.016 --> 20:08.447
[All chanting "Pit"]

20:08.472 --> 20:10.099
You can't do that.

20:11.564 --> 20:14.214
Sure I can.

20:14.652 --> 20:17.333
It's within the law.

20:22.866 --> 20:24.906
The Steve law.

20:24.931 --> 20:26.442
[Sighs]

20:26.467 --> 20:27.869
- [Snaps fingers]
- Grab him!

20:27.894 --> 20:30.413
Grab who? Hey, no, come on!

20:30.438 --> 20:32.089
- Let's go.
- Get off of me! Let me go!

20:32.114 --> 20:33.608
Okay, okay, you got me.
You got me. You got me.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.583
- Squeeze him.
- [Spits] [Bleep] you.

20:35.608 --> 20:37.962
Nigel, you weren't tight enough.

20:39.225 --> 20:43.670
This is effed up!
I'm talking about this and this!

20:43.695 --> 20:46.150
I swear, your sex swing, Danny?

20:46.175 --> 20:48.083
Why did you pack this, man?

20:48.108 --> 20:51.879
Oh, God, I bet it's got
your butt juice all over it!

20:51.904 --> 20:53.493
Doesn't it, you freak?!

20:53.518 --> 20:55.985
I hope you're all rock hard.

20:56.180 --> 20:58.425
[Laughs]

20:58.450 --> 21:00.245
I shit myself.
