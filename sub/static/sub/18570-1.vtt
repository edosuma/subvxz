00:27.376 --> 00:30.246
Fragile Fox, Fragile Fox. First squad.

00:31.338 --> 00:33.580
First squad. Over to you, Lieutenant.

00:37.427 --> 00:40.962
How about it, Ingersoll?
Gonna try for that pillbox?

00:42.390 --> 00:46.637
We can give it a try, but we'll
need support if we get jammed.

00:46.769 --> 00:48.263
They still got you pinned?

00:48.396 --> 00:50.768
- Yes.
- Then we go ahead all the way.

00:51.524 --> 00:56.233
But if we get pinned down, we'll need
Captain Cooney to get us outta there.

00:56.779 --> 01:01.571
- Fragile Fox, over and out.
- Heroes. Glory hounds.

01:03.202 --> 01:07.781
Got that, Captain? First squad from
my platoon, they're going all the way.

01:07.915 --> 01:09.559
Are your men set to support 'em?

01:10.167 --> 01:12.837
Give me a hand signal. Out.

01:42.241 --> 01:43.652
Höher.

01:54.002 --> 01:57.702
Lousy mortar.
They got Ingersoll's squad zeroed in.

01:58.256 --> 02:02.550
They're pinned by machine-gun fire.
Now they're getting it with mortars.

02:02.677 --> 02:05.714
Attack from your side,
take the heat off of Ingersoll.

02:07.724 --> 02:11.508
Fragile Fox One, this is Two.
Let's get the lead out!

02:11.645 --> 02:14.183
Over and out.

02:17.067 --> 02:20.021
Cooney, where are you?
You said you'd back them up!

02:22.030 --> 02:24.782
It's up to you, Cooney. Do you hear me?

02:24.908 --> 02:26.319
Cooney, where are you?!

02:26.451 --> 02:28.491
Fall back!

02:44.010 --> 02:45.469
Cooney! Cooney!

02:46.554 --> 02:49.758
I can't hold.
The machine gun's still got us pinned.

02:49.891 --> 02:54.102
You said you'd back them up!
Come in, Cooney.

02:54.228 --> 02:56.933
Cooney! Cooney! Cooney, over!

03:06.073 --> 03:08.149
It's all over, Lieutenant.

03:09.243 --> 03:12.279
Yeah, you're just wasting your battery.

05:13.156 --> 05:15.196
That's all for today, fellas.

05:15.325 --> 05:20.153
If you have a request, send it to me,
care of Armed Forces Radio Service.

05:20.289 --> 05:22.233
Goodbye.

05:25.669 --> 05:29.002
All right, all right, knock it off.
Come on.

05:32.718 --> 05:34.378
Knock it off!

05:34.511 --> 05:40.300
We've been waitin' around here for
two hours and you expect instant coffee.

05:40.434 --> 05:42.510
Jackson, you ain't an orderly orderly.

05:42.644 --> 05:45.681
And that jug is out of uniform.
It ain't wearing any rust.

05:46.773 --> 05:51.067
- Fill it up. That oughta make it rusty.
- Very funny. Who's it for?

05:51.194 --> 05:52.986
- Captain Cooney.
- Captain Cooney?

05:53.113 --> 05:56.233
Every time Jackson runs an errand,
Cooney tips him a stripe.

05:56.366 --> 06:00.779
- Hurry. He's expecting Colonel Bartlett.
- There's a parlay for ya.

06:00.913 --> 06:04.411
When you salute them two,
you gotta apologise to your arm.

06:05.458 --> 06:08.791
- What's with Cooney and the colonel?
- What's the hot dope?

06:08.920 --> 06:11.920
- You got the inside pipe to Cooney.
- Spit it.

06:12.048 --> 06:15.713
We get Christmas in Paris, or do I
climb the walls to get to my pin-ups?

06:15.843 --> 06:18.879
- The captain never tells me anything.
- Baloney.

06:19.013 --> 06:21.800
Jackson, you're a traitor.

06:21.933 --> 06:25.099
Besides, I don't trust soldiers
who shine their shoes.

06:25.227 --> 06:28.098
Jackson! Jackson!

06:29.607 --> 06:33.023
- His master's voice.
- Mother's calling.

06:33.152 --> 06:35.192
- Coffee, Private?
- Why not?

06:35.321 --> 06:37.563
I already got an ulcer.

06:44.789 --> 06:46.283
Strong, ain't it?

06:52.129 --> 06:55.748
- You called me, Captain?
- Yes, I called. Where are the forms?

06:55.883 --> 06:58.006
- Which forms, sir?
- Which...?

06:58.135 --> 07:01.718
The replacement forms.
They should be at Division today.

07:01.847 --> 07:05.466
- Already sent them out, sir.
- Oh. OK.

07:05.601 --> 07:07.808
Did you get the coffee?

07:10.563 --> 07:12.022
Yes, sir.

07:12.148 --> 07:14.188
Well, come on, come on!

07:15.986 --> 07:20.482
The way they run this army...
Inefficiency, repetition.

07:20.615 --> 07:26.369
Huh! I tell you, son, if I ran my business
back home the way they run this army,

07:26.496 --> 07:28.738
I'd be bankrupt in a month.

07:28.873 --> 07:31.791
- One month!
- Yes, sir.

07:31.918 --> 07:35.963
It'd be a break for the taxpayers
if they'd let some...

07:36.089 --> 07:39.209
let some businessmen
take over for a change.

07:39.342 --> 07:41.916
It's an interesting idea, Captain.

07:43.763 --> 07:46.800
Get that box of cigars
out of my musette.

07:46.933 --> 07:52.853
I want Clyde... Colonel Bartlett...
to feel like he was back home.

07:54.024 --> 07:58.068
Like we was both back home.
Little ol' Riverview.

07:58.194 --> 08:02.655
- Some cigars and a few ashtrays, too?
- Yeah, but nothing fancy.

08:02.782 --> 08:07.528
We're just a couple of small-town
boys, the colonel and me. Understand?

08:07.662 --> 08:09.702
We like our pleasures...

08:14.627 --> 08:16.666
simple.

08:16.795 --> 08:19.749
- Get a towel, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

08:26.597 --> 08:28.506
- John?
- Yes, sir?

08:28.641 --> 08:32.804
Did you get those requisitions
approved for the winter underwear?

08:32.937 --> 08:35.688
Wouldn't you know it, sir?
Only the top parts.

08:35.813 --> 08:38.270
Great. Just great.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.520
Hi, there, Woody boy.
You all set for the game?

08:41.654 --> 08:43.895
- All ready.
- The colonel will be along...

08:44.030 --> 08:46.070
Where is Costa?

08:48.035 --> 08:49.992
- Joe? Hasn't he shown up?
- No!

08:50.120 --> 08:55.363
He's been getting a little out of line
lately. He's unofficer-like.

08:55.501 --> 08:57.908
I'm sure you're mistaken, Captain.

08:58.045 --> 09:02.209
John, you told the lieutenant
he was expected, didn't you?

09:03.300 --> 09:06.385
Yes, sir. I told him this morning.

09:17.105 --> 09:19.181
Ten-hut!

09:21.442 --> 09:24.646
- Carry on, gentlemen. Corporal.
- Hey! Hi.

09:24.779 --> 09:29.192
Erskine, Woodruff. Is this all?
You in a mind to play three-handed?

09:29.325 --> 09:33.074
Costa's been held up.
I'm gonna put a torch under him now.

09:33.204 --> 09:35.411
You do that, son.

09:38.042 --> 09:40.747
And tell him I said
to bring plenty of money.

09:40.878 --> 09:42.622
Yes, sir.

09:43.881 --> 09:46.669
Well, Clyde! Glad you could get over!

09:46.801 --> 09:49.802
Sure... Where's that bourbon
you were talkin' about?

09:49.929 --> 09:52.052
Comin' right up.

10:02.442 --> 10:04.518
You, uh, care for a little branch water?

10:04.652 --> 10:07.322
You don't want me
to rust my plumbing, do you?

10:18.124 --> 10:22.073
Ø Pittsburgh, mon père faisait ça.

10:22.210 --> 10:24.748
Oh? Il était forgeron?

10:27.883 --> 10:31.086
- Costa, where are you?
- I'm in here, Harry!

10:37.100 --> 10:39.971
Yeah. Fabriquer...

10:40.103 --> 10:43.353
Harry, how do you say "railroad tracks"?

10:43.482 --> 10:45.807
- Des rails de chemin de fer.
- All right.

10:45.943 --> 10:47.686
Des rails de chemin de fer.

10:47.819 --> 10:49.278
Oh.

10:49.404 --> 10:51.314
Harry, meet Monsieur Bouisse.

10:51.448 --> 10:53.524
Monsieur Bouisse, Lieutenant Woodruff.

10:53.659 --> 10:55.900
Enchanté. Enchanté.

10:56.036 --> 11:00.745
- This is his shop. It's nice, huh?
- Yeah. Look, you know what time it is?

11:00.874 --> 11:05.335
Know how old this shop is? 500 years.

11:05.462 --> 11:09.756
- It's been in his family all that time.
- I know, George Washington slept here.

11:09.883 --> 11:12.339
Look, Joe, the colonel's here.

11:12.469 --> 11:15.719
If we don't talk to him now,
we might not get another chance.

11:15.847 --> 11:17.887
So he's here.

11:19.101 --> 11:21.639
- All right, Jackson, take off.
- Yes, sir.

11:21.770 --> 11:24.308
Don't worry about
little ol' Erskine Cooney.

11:24.439 --> 11:26.478
- Sit down.
- Yeah.

11:32.697 --> 11:36.564
- Well? Did you bring the letter?
- The letter?

11:36.701 --> 11:39.274
- From my father.
- No, I'm sorry, I forgot.

11:39.412 --> 11:43.990
- I left it up at headquarters.
- Oh... Well, that's all right.

11:44.125 --> 11:48.122
Just that... he hasn't written to me
very much lately, and...

11:48.254 --> 11:51.374
The judge's been busy,
what with elections coming.

11:51.507 --> 11:53.215
Oh, yeah. I guess so.

11:53.342 --> 11:57.422
But I reckon he'd be proud
if he could see me now.

11:57.555 --> 12:00.675
Sure. You're a company commander
in the US Infantry.

12:00.808 --> 12:03.264
Well told, I am. And, uh...

12:04.353 --> 12:08.647
- when my citation comes through...
- Oh, yes. The, uh, citation.

12:08.774 --> 12:13.686
That'll make up for those times
I let him down. You know what I mean?

12:13.821 --> 12:15.861
Oh, excuse me.

12:16.949 --> 12:19.487
You know, I was thinking, Clyde.

12:20.578 --> 12:22.867
Maybe I'll keep it a secret.

12:22.997 --> 12:26.911
Then when I come home,
I'll walk right up to him,

12:27.043 --> 12:30.458
I'll put my hand out for a shake,
and when he looks down...

12:32.213 --> 12:34.372
- Huh?
- That's one way of doin' it.

12:34.507 --> 12:36.215
That old man'll just about bust!

12:36.343 --> 12:39.676
Yes, he will. And I aim
to get that citation for you.

12:39.804 --> 12:41.797
But you're gonna have to be patient.

12:41.932 --> 12:44.849
- Sure thing, Clyde.
- These things take time.

12:44.976 --> 12:48.677
The right moment comes along,
and I'll slip it through.

12:49.648 --> 12:52.139
- You wanna know something?
- What?

12:52.275 --> 12:54.897
We get back home...

12:55.028 --> 12:59.156
I'm gonna go right on
calling you "Colonel". Huh?

13:00.158 --> 13:02.566
Huh? What do you think?

13:06.748 --> 13:09.073
I think I'd like that fine.

13:10.919 --> 13:15.248
I'm hard put to recall a bona fide
colonel in our corner of the state.

13:17.175 --> 13:20.840
Joe, I've got a plan for getting
Cooney out of the company.

13:20.971 --> 13:22.963
A lost cause.

13:23.098 --> 13:26.015
- Are you gonna listen to me?
- What's to listen?

13:26.142 --> 13:31.385
You know Bartlett has political ambitions.
Cooney's old man owns the machine.

13:31.523 --> 13:34.606
QED, Erskine can do no wrong.
We got him for the duration.

13:34.733 --> 13:40.154
Now you've got that off your chest, listen
to me for a second and shut up, will ya?

13:40.281 --> 13:43.151
- Huh?
- Go ahead.

13:43.284 --> 13:46.735
All right, now. I'll give it
to you plain and simple.

13:47.830 --> 13:49.639
One is,

13:49.740 --> 13:54.904
at least a part of Bartlet's political
future depends on his war record, right?

13:55.004 --> 13:58.207
Two: Bartlett is no fool, right? Huh?

13:58.340 --> 14:00.748
- Yeah, right.
- OK.

14:00.884 --> 14:05.546
Three is, Cooney is completely
unreliable and Bartlett knows it.

14:05.681 --> 14:09.382
His next foul-up could be a big one.
Not 14 men, but something big.

14:09.518 --> 14:11.677
Let's face it, this is for keeps.

14:12.771 --> 14:15.476
- So what is the plan?
- OK...

14:16.275 --> 14:20.937
I'd like to lay it on the line with Bartlett,
suggest that he kick Cooney upstairs.

14:21.071 --> 14:23.443
- Not a chance.
- Why not?

14:23.574 --> 14:27.109
He gets the guy stashed away
in a desk job at Battalion or Division.

14:27.244 --> 14:30.281
Worst he can do is get
his thumb caught in a filing cabinet.

14:30.414 --> 14:35.242
Our worries are over, Bartlet's worries
are over. All we gotta do is fight the war.

14:35.377 --> 14:38.129
Come on, Joe, what do you say?
How about it, huh?

14:38.255 --> 14:40.543
It won't work.

14:40.673 --> 14:41.836
Why not?

14:41.966 --> 14:46.260
It won't work! And he won't go for
this straight-talk routine.

14:46.387 --> 14:50.515
He's a lieutenant colonel,
and you're just a lousy lieutenant.

14:50.642 --> 14:53.215
He'll hit you with
that old, sweet song about

14:53.353 --> 14:57.813
"Son, I was in the National Guard
while you was learning your ABCs."

14:57.941 --> 15:00.099
They're two of a kind.

15:00.234 --> 15:05.027
Huh! I bet Cooney never figured on a war
when he joined that National Guard.

15:05.156 --> 15:10.032
Probably figured it was gonna be
all corn pone and chitlins and...

15:12.914 --> 15:16.864
and the chance to wear his uniform
to the Saturday fox hunt.

15:17.001 --> 15:19.160
OK, I'll go it alone.

15:23.466 --> 15:26.384
Don't go dramatic on me, dogface.

15:31.015 --> 15:34.384
I'll play cards,
if you think it'll do any good.

15:34.519 --> 15:37.970
OK. I tell ya, it's the only way
we're gonna get close to Bartlett.

15:38.106 --> 15:41.557
Just remember,
one crack out of Cooney...

15:41.693 --> 15:43.731
Just one.

15:45.153 --> 15:48.522
- Five in a row!
- When are leaves gonna start, Colonel?

15:48.657 --> 15:51.777
Soon as we get back
to France and settle down.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.615
You suppose this war might be over
before we re-form?

15:54.746 --> 15:57.451
I hate to disappoint you,
but I wager it will be.

15:57.583 --> 16:01.627
Sure hate to go in any rough stuff
with those green kids they've sent us.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.793
Yeah, those replacements need work.

16:03.922 --> 16:07.587
Don't worry. We'll all go home
with a record we can be proud of.

16:07.718 --> 16:12.012
Anybody says Fox Company
isn't tops can answer to me.

16:12.139 --> 16:16.765
I swear, this CO of yours is about
as touchy as a she-bear with cubs.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.933
Yeah, sure is.

16:20.856 --> 16:23.691
What's it gonna be here,
five-card no-draw?

16:23.817 --> 16:27.518
Suits me. OK with the rest of you boys?
Still a 50-franc limit?

16:27.654 --> 16:28.983
Yeah.

16:29.114 --> 16:32.364
Wheel 'em and deal 'em, Lieutenant.
Wheel and deal.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.781
"She-bear with cubs".

16:36.038 --> 16:39.572
What kind of a crack is that?
What do you mean by that?

16:39.708 --> 16:43.042
- Come on, Erskine.
- Ante up, Joe.

16:47.633 --> 16:53.136
This is a friendly game, Costa. I aim to
keep it that way. You're trying to bait me.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.421
Sit down. He didn't mean a thing.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.047
- You think so?
- It was a joke.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.260
Tell him it was a joke, Costa.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.597
I made a joke.

17:07.484 --> 17:11.944
I guess you'll be mixing in some politics
back in Riverview, Colonel.

17:12.073 --> 17:16.201
Oh, I don't know. I might run
for dogcatcher or something.

17:16.327 --> 17:19.577
"Tippecanoe and Bartlett too."
I'm under the gun?

17:19.704 --> 17:23.573
- Yeah.
- Cost you gentlemen 50 francs.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.035
I'll just have to bump you, Colonel.

17:26.170 --> 17:29.005
Oh. Well, I'll take a peek.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.587
Expose yourself, Lieutenant.

17:31.717 --> 17:35.051
- Threes and jacks.
- That's a good hand.

17:35.179 --> 17:40.636
But not good enough. Three lovely ladies,
and I'll just rake the pot.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.844
- You ever lose?
- I can't afford to.

17:42.979 --> 17:47.557
- I'm just a boy from little ol' Riverview.
- I won't forget that last session.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.731
Where was that?

17:53.071 --> 17:57.199
Oh... that was in that cellar
outside Aachen.

17:58.535 --> 18:02.579
You cleaned us all out that game, too.
I kept bucking you.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.829
Oh, yeah. You and that...

18:04.958 --> 18:09.501
Lathrop was his name, Colonel.
Lieutenant Ned Lathrop.

18:09.629 --> 18:12.547
That's right. Lathrop.
He was a good man.

18:13.633 --> 18:17.845
Too bad about him. What was he doing?
Trying to help the squad that got cut off?

18:17.971 --> 18:20.509
Sergeant Ingersoll's squad
from my platoon.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.929
- Well, he...
- He what?

18:26.938 --> 18:31.684
Ingersoll disobeyed orders, trying to take
that pillbox. He overstepped his authority.

18:31.818 --> 18:36.361
They were good men.
The best, if you ask me.

18:36.489 --> 18:38.565
Well, I didn't ask you, Lieutenant.

18:38.700 --> 18:42.283
Now, gentlemen,
let's keep this a friendly game.

18:42.412 --> 18:43.740
Same game.

18:43.872 --> 18:48.997
- Anyone could've seen it was hopeless.
- I don't think it was hopeless, Captain.

18:49.127 --> 18:52.294
You can think anything you want.
There's no law against it.

18:52.422 --> 18:56.289
But I'm ordering you to keep
your lousy insinuations to yourself!

18:56.426 --> 19:00.339
- Erskine!
- He has no right to question my honour!

19:00.471 --> 19:04.515
- Ingersoll was one of my best men.
- Sit down, Erskine.

19:04.642 --> 19:07.642
If you're so friendly with your men,
resign your commission.

19:07.770 --> 19:11.637
You don't want to be an officer.
You're just a snotnosed pup!

19:11.774 --> 19:12.805
Cooney!

19:12.942 --> 19:15.563
Come on, come on! Come on, Joe.

19:22.284 --> 19:25.618
It's all right, Harry. I'm going.

19:28.499 --> 19:30.575
If you'll excuse me, Colonel.

19:40.761 --> 19:42.421
I'm sorry I blew it, Clyde.

19:42.554 --> 19:47.098
Why don't you go outside and walk
around? Maybe that'll cool you off.

19:47.226 --> 19:48.803
Yes...

19:50.437 --> 19:52.513
I guess I will.

20:04.075 --> 20:07.278
I'm mighty sorry
this had to happen, Clyde.

20:26.723 --> 20:29.095
I'll give this to Joe when I see him.

20:30.810 --> 20:34.642
Everybody goes off the deep end
sometime or another, don't they?

20:34.772 --> 20:36.231
Yes, sir.

20:36.357 --> 20:39.477
All the same, I don't think
we should spread this around.

20:39.611 --> 20:42.446
- Spread what around?
- That's the idea.

20:45.116 --> 20:47.903
Boys seem a little touchy these days.

20:48.036 --> 20:50.953
Yes, sir, they are.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.571
While we're on the subject, Colonel...

20:55.376 --> 20:57.950
There's something that I'd like to say.

20:58.087 --> 21:00.460
Shoot.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.214
Well...

21:03.509 --> 21:07.423
The morale of this company is in what
I consider to be a dangerous condition.

21:07.554 --> 21:11.053
Oh? And what do you suppose
brought this about, Lieutenant?

21:11.183 --> 21:14.219
I think it stemmed from
what happened at Aachen.

21:14.353 --> 21:15.728
Oh?

21:15.854 --> 21:18.772
Colonel, I know you
and Captain Cooney are very close.

21:18.899 --> 21:21.472
Maybe I'm sticking my neck out on this,

21:21.610 --> 21:26.984
but the feeling among the men is that
the captain... that he chickened out there.

21:27.115 --> 21:29.653
That your opinion, too?

21:29.785 --> 21:32.821
He had the only reserve.
He might've done something.

21:32.955 --> 21:36.999
On the other hand he may have felt
his reserve wasn't strong enough.

21:37.125 --> 21:39.498
Then the facts are hardly conclusive.

21:39.628 --> 21:42.498
It's not a matter
of conclusive facts, sir!

21:43.632 --> 21:47.630
Colonel, can I talk to you straight?
Rank and all that aside?

21:47.761 --> 21:49.801
I don't see why not.

21:57.271 --> 22:02.098
Don't suppose whatever it is you want
to go beyond the two of us. Shoot.

22:02.234 --> 22:05.603
Colonel, you know
Captain Cooney better than...

22:07.197 --> 22:11.443
...better than any man in this division,
maybe better than any man alive.

22:12.201 --> 22:16.780
I know Erskine. Ever since I was
14 years old, a clerk in the judge's office.

22:16.914 --> 22:19.488
You know his good points
and his shortcomings.

22:19.625 --> 22:23.326
- Go on.
- You know he fouled up there at Aachen.

22:23.462 --> 22:27.412
He cost the lives of a whole squad.
A good sergeant, a good lieutenant.

22:27.550 --> 22:31.678
Think what he could do
if this company got in a real bind.

22:31.804 --> 22:37.047
Come on, son, give me the punch line.
You want me to kick Erskine upstairs?

22:37.184 --> 22:40.600
- Yes, sir, as a matter of fact...
- It figures.

22:40.730 --> 22:45.605
And it's not a bad solution. But there's
some points you're not considering.

22:45.735 --> 22:49.353
You talked straight to me
and I'm gonna talk straight to you.

22:49.488 --> 22:54.945
I'd appreciate your discretion. This is
in confidence between you and me.

22:55.077 --> 23:00.035
Erskine's very important to me. Let's
make no pretence. We both know why.

23:00.166 --> 23:04.033
My staff is small, compact, efficient.
Runs like clockwork.

23:04.170 --> 23:08.084
Between you and me, I got no room
for Erskine over at Battalion.

23:08.215 --> 23:11.631
- I thought of Division.
- I send him up to General Parsons?

23:11.761 --> 23:14.429
In what capacity? I mean, specifically.

23:15.305 --> 23:17.974
So you see how it is.
We all got our troubles.

23:18.099 --> 23:21.718
I appreciate your concern
for the morale of this company.

23:21.853 --> 23:23.478
I'm just as concerned. More.

23:23.605 --> 23:28.101
- I'm responsible for this company.
- Why don't you face the facts?!

23:28.235 --> 23:31.520
- A lot of guys are gonna get killed...
- Shut up!

23:31.655 --> 23:35.522
You spoke your piece, now I'm gonna
speak mine. You listening?

23:35.659 --> 23:37.283
Yes, sir.

23:37.410 --> 23:40.744
It all boils down to one basic fact.

23:40.872 --> 23:42.699
This company is...

23:42.832 --> 23:47.957
Let's just say it's a bit shaky in the morale
department and not too fit for combat.

23:48.088 --> 23:49.463
- Correct?
- Correct.

23:49.589 --> 23:51.712
- That's your worry?
- That's my worry.

23:51.841 --> 23:54.332
Then you can forget about it.

23:54.469 --> 23:58.052
- What's your first name?
- Harry.

23:58.181 --> 24:01.930
Stop worrying, Harry.
Cos I got it straight from the top.

24:02.060 --> 24:06.354
It's a hundred to one that
we'll never see combat again.

24:07.857 --> 24:10.775
Is that the real word, Colonel?
From the top?

24:10.902 --> 24:14.497
From the top. A hundred to one.

24:19.910 --> 24:23.742
- Fragile Fox One.
- This is Division. Colonel Bartlett there?

24:23.872 --> 24:25.912
Yes. Hold on just a minute.

24:29.336 --> 24:30.368
Colonel Bartlett.

24:30.504 --> 24:34.205
General Parsons wants to see all
commanders as soon as possible.

24:34.341 --> 24:37.793
- Tell the general I'll be right over.
- Thank you, sir.

24:37.928 --> 24:40.799
So, that being the situation...

24:42.516 --> 24:46.466
I want you to relax
about Erskine. Ride it out.

24:46.604 --> 24:51.562
A year from now, you'll be a civilian again,
adjusting to the problems of peace.

24:51.692 --> 24:53.898
I feel better already, Colonel.

24:55.112 --> 24:57.685
That's the ticket, Harry.

25:12.004 --> 25:15.171
Can you see me with a shave,
haircut, some toilet water?

25:15.299 --> 25:19.961
You talk like you're the last guy left.
And we don't know if we're going back.

25:20.095 --> 25:22.503
- Colonel's driver told me.
- What does he know?

25:22.640 --> 25:26.588
- All right, there's the lieutenant. Ask him.
- OK, I will.

25:26.726 --> 25:31.103
Hey, Lieutenant, about that scuttlebutt.
Is it for real?

25:31.231 --> 25:34.231
- What scuttlebutt?
- About us being out of it.

25:34.359 --> 25:37.478
- Don't bet on it.
- I hope they're right for once.

25:37.612 --> 25:40.696
Let's face it, I'm a hero.
I got the blood lust.

25:40.823 --> 25:43.065
I'm a glory hound, and when I get...

25:43.201 --> 25:45.526
But you just don't like to fight.

25:45.662 --> 25:48.235
That's my problem, Chaplain. I'm yellow.

25:48.373 --> 25:53.615
PFC Bernstein, plump fat coward. Can
I get a section eight for being yellow?

25:53.753 --> 25:59.127
Most of the guys'd all go to hell in a
bucket for you or Lieutenant Woodruff.

25:59.259 --> 26:03.090
The way things are, this outfit's
got an esprit de garbage pail.

26:03.221 --> 26:06.008
- Your French stinks.
- So does the morale.

26:06.140 --> 26:08.050
Beat it.

26:09.060 --> 26:10.056
Yes, sir.

26:12.522 --> 26:14.894
Lieutenant Costa, sir.

26:15.984 --> 26:20.776
- Russians!
- He's a regular Cossack. He's real tough.

26:20.905 --> 26:25.863
But underneath it all, Snowden,
there beats a heart of solid rock.

26:25.994 --> 26:28.069
Stop the scratching, Bernstein.

26:28.203 --> 26:31.821
I'm just checking to see
if I got my dog tags.

26:31.957 --> 26:33.914
Hello, Lieutenant.

26:35.252 --> 26:38.917
- I thought I'd find you here.
- So, what happened?

26:39.047 --> 26:40.921
You jerk. Why did you blow up?

26:41.049 --> 26:44.050
Forget that. I saw the colonel leave.
What happened?

26:44.177 --> 26:47.878
I talked to him. I told him that
we were in no shape for combat.

26:48.015 --> 26:50.588
- All right, let's go!
- And?

26:50.726 --> 26:54.426
- What's going on over there?
- Never mind. What did he say?

26:54.563 --> 26:58.014
He already knew about Cooney,
and he was understanding.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.688
Sure. Understanding.

27:00.819 --> 27:03.524
You'd think those two
were a vaudeville team.

27:03.655 --> 27:06.989
Erskine and Clyde:
Funny sayings, eccentric dances.

27:07.117 --> 27:09.738
Just a couple
of little ol' country boys.

27:10.787 --> 27:12.827
Up to their knees in blood.

27:12.956 --> 27:16.206
What it adds up to is this:
We've nothing to worry about

27:16.335 --> 27:19.289
as far as Cooney is concerned.

27:19.421 --> 27:23.585
The word from upstairs is
it looks like we're out of the shooting.

27:26.261 --> 27:29.962
- What if we're not?
- He said it's a hundred to one that we are.

27:30.098 --> 27:34.095
What if we have to go back up? The
colonel conned you out of any action.

27:34.227 --> 27:36.931
He didn't con me.
He talked straight sense.

27:37.063 --> 27:39.221
You haven't got it figured. I have.

27:39.357 --> 27:44.351
If we go back, I got a solution for Cooney.
A simple one. No channels to go through.

27:44.487 --> 27:48.983
- Just a nice, simple solution.
- What? Joe! What would you do?

27:49.116 --> 27:53.363
I got it figured.
Just let him goof once more.

27:55.414 --> 27:58.581
- Look, don't get any funny ideas.
- I mean it, Harry!

28:00.002 --> 28:01.829
Lieutenant!

28:03.714 --> 28:07.130
Get your men on the road
in 20 minutes, sir. Full packs.

28:07.260 --> 28:10.842
- Back to France?
- No, sir. We're going back up.

28:10.972 --> 28:13.759
There's been a big breakthrough.

28:13.891 --> 28:17.474
The paratroopers are already
on their way up.

28:17.603 --> 28:21.019
All right. Better get over
and alert the platoon.

28:22.191 --> 28:26.059
I want all platoon leaders outside the TP
once their men are on the road.

28:26.195 --> 28:27.939
Yes, sir.

28:28.072 --> 28:29.566
Well?

28:36.621 --> 28:38.199
A hundred to one, huh?

28:38.373 --> 28:40.282
Joe! Joe!

28:41.668 --> 28:45.037
Cooney is still in command,
for better or worse.

28:45.171 --> 28:48.256
And that's the situation.
And I'm the exec.

28:48.383 --> 28:52.132
If anything happens to him...
I don't care if it's you or anyone else.

28:52.262 --> 28:54.634
The office makes the man, huh, Harry?

28:55.724 --> 28:58.096
Let's wait and see developments.

29:29.966 --> 29:32.338
The section we're concerned with is...

29:32.469 --> 29:35.304
Now, here we are. And the...

29:36.765 --> 29:39.172
- May I have your attention?
- Sorry.

29:39.309 --> 29:42.843
Here we are. You got it?
We want this town, La Nelle.

29:42.978 --> 29:47.225
You won't need this map till you get there
cos you can see it from the hill.

29:47.358 --> 29:49.564
- What does G-2 say?
- Nothing.

29:49.693 --> 29:54.818
It hasn't been taken yet.
I don't care how you do it. Just do it.

29:54.949 --> 29:56.609
Right. Will do.

29:56.742 --> 30:00.692
Keep contact with me on the 201.
Maybe the Krauts have pulled out.

30:00.829 --> 30:04.448
If they have, walk in.
If they haven't, run them out.

30:04.583 --> 30:09.044
- Can we expect any assistance?
- All the other companies are committed.

30:09.171 --> 30:12.421
This operation on La Nelle
is strictly Fox Company.

30:12.549 --> 30:14.008
- OK, sir.
- Good luck.

30:20.599 --> 30:26.269
Well, Woodruff, looks like Fox Company's
got another tough job.

30:26.397 --> 30:29.184
Hitting the town
from both sides would do it.

30:29.316 --> 30:32.187
We can use Weapons
in reserve for the 1st and 2nd.

30:32.319 --> 30:36.566
- I'll take Weapons, you take 1st and 2nd?
- That's sound enough. Jackson!

30:36.699 --> 30:40.993
Get Lieutenant Costa over here.
Tell him to bring his platoon sergeant.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.527
- Come on, on the double!
- Yes, sir.

30:43.664 --> 30:46.747
If the first platoon gets pinned,
we can cover them.

30:52.880 --> 30:56.000
Let's take a closer look here.
Now, supposing...

30:56.134 --> 30:59.337
supposing we send a platoon
to probe down the road here.

30:59.470 --> 31:03.089
Nobody there, they walk in.
We follow 'em.

31:03.224 --> 31:06.309
If they meet with any resistance...

31:06.436 --> 31:11.062
Here. They take this old house,
here in the outskirts, and they hole up.

31:11.190 --> 31:15.402
- I don't know about that.
- Your idea is sound. It's very sound.

31:15.528 --> 31:17.770
But it's rigid. It's by the book.

31:17.906 --> 31:21.025
This way we hold off
till we see what's what,

31:21.159 --> 31:23.198
then we can hit 'em from either side.

31:23.328 --> 31:27.160
And we got a base of fire
right here in the town, if we need it.

31:27.290 --> 31:29.698
Yes, sir, that's the plan.

31:29.834 --> 31:32.621
That would be one method, I suppose.

31:37.091 --> 31:39.380
Hey, Costa.

31:39.510 --> 31:42.215
We've got another
nasty little job to do here.

31:43.306 --> 31:45.345
La Nelle?

31:46.851 --> 31:50.634
Yeah. Division wants it occupied.
We got the assignment.

31:50.771 --> 31:54.306
There may be Krauts in there.
Most likely not.

31:54.441 --> 31:57.976
Let's just go on the basis
that there are.

31:58.111 --> 32:02.239
Here. You take your platoon
right down this road here.

32:02.366 --> 32:04.904
You'll be covered most of the way.

32:07.412 --> 32:12.121
- You get there, you outpost the town.
- Sounds nice and neat, Captain.

32:13.210 --> 32:18.204
Now let's go on the basis that
the joint is just crawling with Krauts.

32:18.340 --> 32:21.092
I'm in there with one platoon.

32:22.469 --> 32:24.794
What happens?

32:24.930 --> 32:28.429
You take this house here in the outskirts
and you hole up.

32:28.559 --> 32:32.141
We hit them with the rest of the company.
You give us a base of fire.

32:32.271 --> 32:34.643
If we need it. Got it?

32:35.732 --> 32:38.306
You run into any real trouble,
we'll be behind you.

32:38.443 --> 32:40.519
I hope.

32:43.949 --> 32:49.489
All right, if you don't like it, I'll get
Lieutenant Miller's platoon to try it.

32:51.206 --> 32:55.417
- Are you for it, Harry?
- Joe, I think it should work.

32:57.461 --> 33:01.589
Toliver, we'll move the men
down the road in a platoon column.

33:02.675 --> 33:05.759
Road's covered till about
400 yards from the house.

33:05.887 --> 33:11.510
That last stretch I don't like.
Wide open. Could be trouble.

33:11.642 --> 33:15.058
Only thing good about it
is it's downhill.

33:15.187 --> 33:16.267
What?

33:16.397 --> 33:20.098
If they're dug in, they could
give us a hard, hard time.

33:20.234 --> 33:24.730
No use trying to crawl it.
There's no cover.

33:24.864 --> 33:27.319
400 yards in battle gear
is too far to run,

33:27.450 --> 33:33.239
so we'll walk the first half
and then we'll kick out.

33:33.372 --> 33:36.658
And pray. What do you think?

33:36.792 --> 33:41.170
- It could be a real, real crock, sir.
- Get the men moving.

33:41.297 --> 33:43.918
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- Yes, sir.

33:50.264 --> 33:53.598
That's a mighty fine platoon sergeant
you got there.

33:53.726 --> 33:55.802
The best.

34:00.899 --> 34:04.066
And he's not gonna wind up
in any wringer.

34:04.194 --> 34:06.400
Him nor any of the rest of my men.

34:06.529 --> 34:10.195
- What do you mean by that?
- Just this.

34:10.324 --> 34:15.152
We can take that house all right
but, boy, I'd hate to get stuck with it.

34:15.288 --> 34:20.330
- You get into trouble, we'll back you up!
- I know, I got your word on it.

34:20.460 --> 34:23.829
What do you want,
a contract or something?

34:23.964 --> 34:26.455
All right, come on. Don't worry.

34:27.926 --> 34:31.971
- You'll back me up, Harry?
- You want my word too?

34:32.097 --> 34:33.507
Yeah.

34:36.976 --> 34:39.384
All right, you've got it.

34:40.647 --> 34:45.060
Maybe you'd like me to call in Jackson.
Maybe you'd like his word on it, too.

34:46.360 --> 34:49.730
I want Jackson standing by
to receive me.

34:49.864 --> 34:54.906
And, Cooney... I'm gonna to give you
something to think about.

34:55.036 --> 34:58.203
If I ever lose another man
on account of you,

34:58.331 --> 35:00.822
just one,

35:00.959 --> 35:04.541
you'll never see the States again.

35:04.670 --> 35:09.498
That's court-martial talk, soldier.
I got a witness standing right here.

35:09.633 --> 35:14.094
Let him hear me too, loud and clear,
so there won't be any misunderstanding.

35:16.056 --> 35:19.390
You double-cross me
like you did Ingersoll, you...

35:19.518 --> 35:24.476
You play the gutless wonder once more
and I'll come back and I'll get you.

35:26.650 --> 35:30.600
I'll shove this grenade down your throat
and pull the pin.

35:44.418 --> 35:46.458
Here he comes.

35:51.050 --> 35:53.541
Let's go!

35:53.677 --> 35:55.753
Let's go, boys.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.786
All right, end of the line!

36:22.914 --> 36:25.452
Here's where the turkey shoot begins!

36:28.711 --> 36:31.000
How does it look?

36:31.130 --> 36:34.215
I don't know, sir. It's hard to tell.

36:38.721 --> 36:41.259
Hey, soldier,
how'd you like to get relieved?

36:41.391 --> 36:43.549
- What, go down there?
- Sure.

36:45.019 --> 36:46.430
Drop dead.

36:46.563 --> 36:50.014
- It looks quiet.
- So does a graveyard.

36:50.149 --> 36:52.225
That's right, Lieutenant.

36:52.735 --> 36:57.314
You know, there's a cowboy movie
where one joker says

36:57.448 --> 37:02.787
"Mighty quiet out there.
Too quiet," he says.

37:06.332 --> 37:09.748
Same thing every time. It's too quiet.

37:09.877 --> 37:12.202
It is too quiet.

37:15.674 --> 37:18.758
Squad leaders. Medics.

37:18.886 --> 37:21.423
That's an awful long haul, Lieutenant.

37:26.310 --> 37:28.682
That's the farmhouse.

37:28.812 --> 37:32.015
Whether we're running
into trouble or not, we don't know.

37:32.149 --> 37:36.609
It's too far and too bare for crawling,
so it's gonna be a track meet.

37:36.737 --> 37:39.228
Stay off of the road. It could be mined.

37:39.364 --> 37:41.404
- Got it?
- We got it.

37:41.533 --> 37:44.736
That's an awful distance
to run... sir.

37:46.038 --> 37:47.746
We're gonna walk the first half.

37:47.873 --> 37:50.542
- You'll give us the signal?
- That's right.

37:50.667 --> 37:54.119
We'll take off in threes,
well spread, on signal.

37:54.254 --> 37:59.130
Five-second intervals. That oughta
put us about 10, 12 yards apart.

37:59.259 --> 38:03.174
No bunching up, no stopping,
not for anybody.

38:03.305 --> 38:06.638
- Medics, are you ready?
- We're ready, Lieutenant.

38:06.767 --> 38:12.722
We don't want you at the farmhouse.
Attend to casualties between here and...

38:14.942 --> 38:17.692
Toliver and I lead off. And Willis...

38:19.153 --> 38:22.356
- Who's got the radio?
- Right here, sir.

38:26.244 --> 38:29.244
- What's your name, soldier?
- Abramowitz, sir.

38:29.372 --> 38:31.411
You go with us, Abramowitz.

38:32.416 --> 38:34.705
- Johnson, you're calling time.
- Sir.

38:34.835 --> 38:38.002
Keep your eye on me.
If it gets too rugged, I'll signal you.

38:38.130 --> 38:41.546
I don't want to put
the whole platoon in a wringer.

38:42.635 --> 38:45.802
I do this, you hold up
the rest of the men.

38:47.098 --> 38:49.304
Yes, sir.

38:51.352 --> 38:53.973
- All right, move out!
- First squad, move up!

38:54.105 --> 38:56.477
- Move out in threes.
- Second squad, move up.

38:56.607 --> 38:58.896
Come on, boys! Get out there! Let's go!

38:59.402 --> 39:01.441
More, Abramowitz.

39:05.157 --> 39:08.858
Five, four, three, two, and go!

39:10.663 --> 39:14.530
Five, four, three, two, and go!

39:16.252 --> 39:20.119
Five, four, three, two, and go!

39:21.673 --> 39:24.342
Five, four, three, two...

39:24.467 --> 39:27.137
and go!

39:27.262 --> 39:30.962
Five, four, three, two, and go!

39:32.726 --> 39:36.770
Five, four, three, two, and go!

39:38.440 --> 39:42.022
Five, four, three, two, and go!

39:43.737 --> 39:47.355
Five, four, three, two and go!

39:49.451 --> 39:53.116
Five, four, three, two and go!

39:54.998 --> 39:58.912
Five, four, three, two and go!

40:00.837 --> 40:04.705
Five, four, three, two and go!

40:04.841 --> 40:06.668
So far, so good.

40:06.801 --> 40:09.471
If they're in there,
now's when they'll open up.

40:09.596 --> 40:12.466
Yeah. We're too far out to go back now.

40:17.520 --> 40:18.896
Let's go!

41:00.521 --> 41:01.683
Medic!

41:04.608 --> 41:07.064
No more, no more!

41:09.154 --> 41:10.269
That's it.

42:02.081 --> 42:03.457
Cellar.

42:04.751 --> 42:06.161
Cellar.

42:08.254 --> 42:09.832
Upstairs.

42:34.780 --> 42:37.105
All clear.

42:37.241 --> 42:39.482
I got a stitch.

42:47.668 --> 42:49.292
Watch the town.

42:53.674 --> 42:56.461
All clear out back. Is this it?

43:00.264 --> 43:02.552
This all that made it?

43:07.729 --> 43:09.010
Yeah.

43:29.167 --> 43:31.207
I'm way out of condition.

43:33.046 --> 43:37.459
Real bad shape. My wind's all shot.

43:40.219 --> 43:42.591
You know what the cause is?

43:46.517 --> 43:48.973
Too many cigarettes.

43:50.396 --> 43:53.183
From now on, I'm gonna stay healthy.

43:54.650 --> 43:57.853
- You're healthier than he is.
- That's for sure.

43:57.987 --> 44:01.403
- You're lucky it wasn't uphill.
- He'd have never made it.

44:01.532 --> 44:05.530
- Not with all the lead he's carrying.
- That's where I want the lead.

44:05.661 --> 44:09.077
- Nowheres else.
- Maybe he's right.

44:09.206 --> 44:12.907
Sergeant Kelly got it in the gut.
So did Lucas.

44:14.420 --> 44:18.833
- They got Lucas?
- Yes, sir. I seen him fall.

44:18.966 --> 44:21.173
A medic ran over to him.

44:25.306 --> 44:27.678
How about the rest of Johnson's squad?

44:27.808 --> 44:30.928
Liegert caught one in the throat.
It looked like...

44:31.062 --> 44:34.894
Lucky five of us got here.
They really threw it at us.

44:35.024 --> 44:37.266
It wasn't Wiener schnitzel, huh, Sarge?

44:37.401 --> 44:40.355
A German cook can kill you
just as quick.

44:41.906 --> 44:44.657
Kelly. Lucas.

44:48.203 --> 44:50.776
- You're sure about Liegert?
- Yes, sir.

44:50.914 --> 44:54.081
I'm telling you, it's miraculous.

44:54.209 --> 44:56.830
I don't know how I got here.

44:56.962 --> 45:00.959
You know what it is?
It's a miracle, that's what.

45:01.091 --> 45:04.008
- All right.
- Absolutely miraculous.

45:04.135 --> 45:08.797
Sending one platoon in here like that.
Plain crazy, Lieutenant.

45:08.932 --> 45:11.849
How could he ever
dream up one like that?

45:18.024 --> 45:22.852
Settle down. Long as we stay here,
we ought to be OK. They won't rush us.

45:22.988 --> 45:25.276
How do you know, sir?

45:25.407 --> 45:30.199
- Keep watching that town!
- Yes, sir. But how do you know, sir?

45:30.328 --> 45:32.368
I don't know.

45:35.542 --> 45:39.955
But analyse it. We're boxed.
They know it.

45:40.088 --> 45:45.545
All they gotta do is wait till
we stick up our heads, and... pow.

45:45.677 --> 45:49.543
- Just like plucking possum.
- So what do we do, sir?

45:51.849 --> 45:55.681
We sit tight and wait
till the company attacks in strength.

45:55.811 --> 45:58.598
Is that what Cooney said?
That he'd back us up?

45:58.731 --> 46:01.222
That's what the man said.

46:13.871 --> 46:16.243
Well? What do you think?

46:17.333 --> 46:20.583
Relax. You got here.
That means anybody could do it.

46:20.711 --> 46:24.329
Yeah, maybe. Except Captain Cooney, huh?

46:24.465 --> 46:28.925
Take it easy. You don't see
the lieutenant worrying, do you?

46:29.053 --> 46:31.840
- Wanna know what I think?
- What do you think?

46:31.972 --> 46:35.472
The only one who ain't worrying
is Abramowitz there.

46:36.685 --> 46:39.520
Snowden? The hell with being healthy.

46:39.647 --> 46:42.102
- Give me a cigarette.
- Shut up.

46:42.900 --> 46:47.028
Fragile Fox Two to Fragile Fox One,
over to you.

46:47.154 --> 46:49.692
Maybe he's too far, Lieutenant.

46:49.823 --> 46:51.696
- Hey, Lieutenant!
- What?

46:51.824 --> 46:54.612
- I thought I saw something.
- Where?

46:54.744 --> 46:57.911
- On the road, just back of the steeple.
- What was it?

46:58.039 --> 47:01.538
I don't know.
A tank, a turret, something.

47:01.668 --> 47:04.040
- I don't see anything.
- It pulled back.

47:04.170 --> 47:07.005
- That's how it caught my eye.
- A truck?

47:07.131 --> 47:09.457
- Yeah.
- Could very well have been a truck.

47:09.592 --> 47:12.083
The way our luck's going,
it's gotta be a tank.

47:12.220 --> 47:15.505
If they got tanks in there,
they'll nail us to the floor.

47:15.640 --> 47:19.969
- You'd make great wall-to-wall carpeting.
- Shut up, both of you.

47:22.564 --> 47:25.979
Did you spot him? Ricks, you see him?

47:26.109 --> 47:27.389
No, sir.

47:28.152 --> 47:30.311
Fragile Fox Two to Fragile Fox One.

47:30.446 --> 47:35.239
In order to get a shot at Bernstein,
he would have to be...

47:38.663 --> 47:44.618
Yeah, sure. See? The church steeple. That
sacrilegious son-of-a-gun is in the belfry.

47:44.752 --> 47:46.792
How do you know that?

47:49.507 --> 47:51.416
Only place he can angle a shot at you.

47:51.551 --> 47:54.303
- Can you see him?
- Not now, I don't.

47:54.429 --> 47:57.594
If you can't see him,
how can you get a shot at him?

47:57.723 --> 47:59.846
Strategy, Bernstein.

47:59.975 --> 48:03.474
You step out front and bring me in
what you see by the stoop.

48:03.604 --> 48:05.762
- Out front?
- Move.

48:15.324 --> 48:19.653
Fragile Fox Two to Fragile Fox One,
do you read me? Over.

48:19.786 --> 48:22.538
Fragile Fox One,
I read you loud and clear.

48:22.664 --> 48:24.740
Is that you, Jackson? Over.

48:24.875 --> 48:28.160
Yes, sir, it's me. Hold on, Lieutenant.
I'll get somebody. Over.

48:33.050 --> 48:35.885
Captain, it's Lieutenant Costa
on the radio, sir.

48:36.011 --> 48:40.056
See what's doing, Woody boy.
Go on, see what he wants.

48:40.182 --> 48:43.183
You know what he wants, Captain.

48:43.310 --> 48:45.219
All right, bare a hand here!

48:45.354 --> 48:47.845
Get these men in there. Take it easy.

48:50.859 --> 48:55.236
- This is Harry. What's the score? Over.
- Where's Cooney? Over.

48:56.990 --> 49:02.410
- Harry, the town is heavily occupied.
- Ask him if Berlin's occupied.

49:02.536 --> 49:05.656
Tell him Cooney's
a southern-fried schlemiel.

49:05.790 --> 49:07.249
What?

49:08.709 --> 49:14.878
What? They caught us in the open
and they chopped us up. Over.

49:15.007 --> 49:18.293
- You gonna rig a dummy to draw fire?
- You wanna volunteer?

49:18.427 --> 49:20.301
- What a screwball idea.
- Yeah.

49:20.429 --> 49:23.265
I repeat: They chopped us up!

49:25.309 --> 49:29.058
The medics are picking
them up right now. Over.

49:29.188 --> 49:31.596
Put this on him.
It'll make him look real.

49:31.732 --> 49:33.476
They are?

49:35.361 --> 49:38.896
- First wounded are already coming in.
- So where's the support?

49:42.410 --> 49:47.487
Tell Cooney we're pinned.
I repeat: We're pinned!

49:50.877 --> 49:53.249
Doctor, I have a man in the balcony.

49:54.881 --> 49:58.961
Look, you tell him
we're in that little ol' house.

49:59.552 --> 50:03.135
Tell him I lost Lucas, Kelly, Liegert,

50:03.264 --> 50:05.884
I don't know how many.

50:06.016 --> 50:08.720
So where's the rest of the company?

50:08.852 --> 50:13.846
Where's that support that was
gonna be right behind us all? Over!

50:15.066 --> 50:19.775
Joe, hang on. I'll call you right back.
Over and out.

50:19.905 --> 50:20.936
Captain.

50:23.033 --> 50:24.408
Captain!

50:26.578 --> 50:28.286
- Captain!
- Well?

50:28.413 --> 50:30.986
We gotta move.
Joe is pinned. It's our turn.

50:31.124 --> 50:35.869
Let's make sure we make the right move.
Let's not get excited, up in the air!

50:36.588 --> 50:39.838
- I'll have the company saddle up.
- Hold on there!

50:41.259 --> 50:44.344
Maybe there's more to this
than we can handle.

50:48.516 --> 50:50.639
Come on.

50:51.978 --> 50:54.101
Jackson, I'll take over.

50:59.653 --> 51:02.488
What do you mean,
more than we can handle?

51:02.614 --> 51:05.899
We're ordered to take La Nelle.
Let's form up and do it.

51:06.034 --> 51:11.193
- The thing to do is pull 'em back.
- We can't pull back. They're pinned!

51:11.330 --> 51:13.999
Then let 'em hole up!
We'll call for artillery!

51:14.124 --> 51:17.125
Artillery won't do any good.
It takes men to hit the town!

51:17.253 --> 51:21.915
Risk a whole company for the remains
of one platoon? Think straight, boy!

51:22.049 --> 51:25.714
Think straight? I'm thinking
about the job we've gotta do!

51:25.844 --> 51:29.510
If I've made a mistake in judgment,
it was an honest one.

51:30.891 --> 51:35.352
Now, listen, Cooney.
I gave Costa my word.

51:35.479 --> 51:38.978
So what are you, a boy scout?
Some kind of white knight?

51:39.108 --> 51:41.350
I gave him my word.

51:41.485 --> 51:47.072
Look, soldier, to be perfectly frank,
I don't give a damn what you gave him.

51:47.199 --> 51:50.117
Great-looking soldier.
He's uglier than Bernstein.

51:50.244 --> 51:52.402
Hurry it up.

51:52.538 --> 51:56.488
Wait a minute. If this sad sack is gonna
die, why don't we make him an officer?

51:56.625 --> 51:59.496
- Make him a general.
- No, a lieutenant.

52:01.964 --> 52:04.122
Make him a captain.

52:11.599 --> 52:14.136
- You know who he looks like?
- No...

52:14.267 --> 52:17.221
- Shove it out, Bernstein.
- I'll take over.

52:17.353 --> 52:20.390
All right, sir, go out there
and draw some lead.

52:29.324 --> 52:32.906
- Do you see him?
- Yeah, but not enough.

52:33.786 --> 52:35.993
- What does he look like?
- A man.

52:36.122 --> 52:38.162
Them cruddy Krauts.

52:40.877 --> 52:43.629
- A little more, Bernstein.
- More?

52:43.755 --> 52:45.794
Come on, Bernstein.

52:59.520 --> 53:00.896
Wow!

53:02.899 --> 53:05.354
No more bats in that belfry.

53:06.236 --> 53:11.859
- I swear, Toliver, that was shootin'!
- Just like pluckin' possum.

53:11.991 --> 53:13.900
Toliver!

53:14.035 --> 53:16.740
Get away from that hole.

53:18.205 --> 53:20.244
Them cruddy Krauts.

53:24.002 --> 53:27.169
They shoot until you're on top of them.
Then they run out.

53:27.297 --> 53:29.967
"Kamerad. Give me Zigaretten."

53:30.092 --> 53:32.879
The trouble with you, Ricks,
is you're bitter.

53:33.011 --> 53:36.261
Sure. I hate them cruddy Krauts,
if that's what you mean.

53:36.390 --> 53:38.881
- Probably no more than they hate you.
- Me?

53:39.017 --> 53:42.054
- Why should they hate me?
- Cos you're the enemy.

53:42.187 --> 53:47.229
What do you mean? I'm an American,
for crying out loud! They're the enemy.

53:47.359 --> 53:50.443
Abramowitz. Jacob R Abramowitz.

53:50.571 --> 53:52.610
He's got O-type blood.

53:54.283 --> 53:57.901
That's a fine, cruddy note,
calling me the enemy.

53:58.036 --> 54:01.322
What do you think you are?
An exchange student?

54:01.456 --> 54:03.829
How could I be the enemy?

54:03.959 --> 54:06.165
- Ricks!
- Yes, sir?

54:10.591 --> 54:13.545
You leave here again,
I'll beat you bloody!

54:13.677 --> 54:15.504
Got that?

54:39.493 --> 54:42.909
Fragile Fox Two
to Fragile Fox One, over.

54:44.916 --> 54:47.703
Fragile Fox One,
this is Fragile Fox Two.

54:47.835 --> 54:50.326
Where's the support? Over!

55:02.934 --> 55:05.685
Say it again, Harry.

55:05.811 --> 55:10.023
Nice and slow,
so there's no mistake. Over.

55:15.112 --> 55:17.188
Yeah.

55:17.323 --> 55:19.399
We stuck with the lease?

55:21.577 --> 55:22.906
Yeah.

55:31.169 --> 55:32.414
Kommen Sie out.

55:32.546 --> 55:35.215
Raus! Raus!

55:35.340 --> 55:37.167
Come on!

55:41.221 --> 55:43.842
Amerikaner! Freie Menschen!

55:43.974 --> 55:47.010
Wir sind so froh, dass ihr hier seid.

55:47.143 --> 55:52.434
- I thought you flushed out the cellar.
- I did. They must've been hiding.

55:52.566 --> 55:56.100
- Did you look?
- Yeah. No. Who'd have thought of it?

55:56.236 --> 55:59.735
Anybody with their head on!
That wouldn't be you, would it?

55:59.864 --> 56:04.408
Get down there now and search
the whole place! Every last inch of it.

56:05.036 --> 56:06.614
Halt deinen Mund!

56:06.746 --> 56:10.281
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. My uncle.

56:11.251 --> 56:14.702
Er will mich bald rüberbringen,
nach Amerika. Schwartz.

56:14.838 --> 56:17.459
Die Brauerei. Bitte. Das ist mein Onkel.

56:17.591 --> 56:19.714
Halt's Maul.

56:23.179 --> 56:27.177
The mean one's a captain.
It's the same in every army.

56:27.684 --> 56:30.519
Toliver, these boys
are the answer to a prayer.

56:42.156 --> 56:46.485
I want it real quiet now.
I'm gonna work on the old guy.

56:54.877 --> 56:57.119
OK, you. In there.

56:58.547 --> 57:00.587
In there. Panzers?

57:01.842 --> 57:03.550
Panzers, was?

57:03.677 --> 57:05.337
Come on, sprechen Sie!

57:05.471 --> 57:08.176
Otto, ich warne dich.

57:08.307 --> 57:11.391
Nicht sprechen Sie, understand?

57:11.518 --> 57:13.178
Ich weiß gar nichts.

57:13.312 --> 57:15.981
You got the old guy
scared stiff, Lieutenant.

57:16.106 --> 57:17.980
Any mechanised stuff in there?

57:18.108 --> 57:19.484
Was?

57:19.610 --> 57:21.069
Come on, now, sprechen Sie!

57:21.195 --> 57:24.611
Otto, deinen Namen, deinen Rang,
deine Nummer... sonst nichts.

57:24.740 --> 57:27.029
He's making with the Articles of War.

57:27.159 --> 57:31.239
They don't apply to us.
Not in a vice like this.

57:35.584 --> 57:40.826
This is a.45-calibre automatic, Captain.
Verstehen Sie? Nicht sprechen!

57:44.050 --> 57:47.004
How about it? Panzers?

57:47.679 --> 57:49.303
Panzers?

57:50.390 --> 57:52.928
SS, huh? SS?

57:53.059 --> 57:54.637
Ich weiß nicht.

57:54.769 --> 57:58.304
You won't get it out of him.
Whitey's got him too scared.

58:01.276 --> 58:03.315
Namen, Rang und Nummer!

58:03.444 --> 58:05.484
Keep your mouth shut!

58:07.991 --> 58:11.241
Panzers? Come on, now!

58:12.662 --> 58:15.579
- Das sind...
- Otto, du Idiot!

58:15.707 --> 58:21.496
Du brauchst doch nur zu warten.
Im Dorf, auf dem Kirchturm, überall.

58:21.629 --> 58:24.167
Die sind jetzt schon tot.

58:24.299 --> 58:26.090
Tot?

58:26.217 --> 58:28.293
Ja, so gut wie tot.

58:30.805 --> 58:33.474
You know what he says?

58:33.600 --> 58:36.684
He says all they gotta do is wait.

58:36.811 --> 58:41.306
He says we're covered from the town.
He says we're "tot".

58:41.440 --> 58:43.479
Dead.

58:50.657 --> 58:53.860
Got a lot of firepower
in the town, Captain?

58:55.245 --> 58:57.072
Tell me about it.

58:57.206 --> 59:02.580
I take it you are acquainted with the
covenants of the Geneva Convention.

59:02.711 --> 59:07.590
Then you must know that
we will tell you absolutely nothing.

59:26.652 --> 59:28.858
Nicht! Wartet!

59:31.031 --> 59:33.569
Es sind doch wir.

01:00:02.562 --> 01:00:03.972
Panzers?

01:00:05.481 --> 01:00:07.640
Panzers.

01:00:07.775 --> 01:00:10.811
Erschießen Sie mich nicht.
Ich habe drei Kinder.

01:00:10.945 --> 01:00:13.068
How many tanks? One? Two?

01:00:13.197 --> 01:00:14.857
Wie viele?

01:00:14.991 --> 01:00:18.573
Acht, zehn. Und SS.

01:00:18.703 --> 01:00:19.865
What'd he say?

01:00:19.996 --> 01:00:24.373
He says the place is crawling
with mechanised stuff. And SS.

01:00:27.712 --> 01:00:29.254
Ricks.

01:00:32.675 --> 01:00:35.248
Fragile Fox Two
to Fragile Fox One, over.

01:00:37.889 --> 01:00:43.345
Woodruff... I can't hear you.
I can't hear you. Over.

01:00:43.477 --> 01:00:45.269
Louder, Harry. I can't...

01:00:45.396 --> 01:00:47.472
Hey, look! A tank!

01:00:52.277 --> 01:00:55.112
The guy wasn't lying.
They'll flatten us.

01:00:55.238 --> 01:00:57.445
What a way to reduce.

01:00:57.991 --> 01:00:59.402
Woodruff?

01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:03.408
Are you receiving me? Over.

01:01:05.457 --> 01:01:09.157
OK, get this: Tanks are in here.

01:01:10.128 --> 01:01:13.663
I don't know how many.
We're pulling out!

01:01:13.798 --> 01:01:16.503
I repeat: We're pulling out!

01:01:18.303 --> 01:01:20.296
Request artillery and smoke cover.

01:01:20.889 --> 01:01:25.765
Request artillery and smoke cover. Over.

01:01:27.479 --> 01:01:30.978
Roger. Fragile Fox Two out. No, wait!

01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:36.270
I got a message for Cooney. Understand?

01:01:38.657 --> 01:01:41.776
You tell him I'm comin' back.

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:44.199
Tell him I'm comin' back!

01:01:44.746 --> 01:01:48.874
Start that artillery.
Fragile Fox Two out.

01:01:57.591 --> 01:02:00.378
B Battery, this is Fox Company.

01:02:02.179 --> 01:02:05.014
I don't have to draw you
a picture on this one.

01:02:06.308 --> 01:02:10.555
Keep the house between you
and the town as long as you can.

01:02:13.232 --> 01:02:16.767
Just let me make one thing clear.

01:02:16.902 --> 01:02:21.315
I'm not just giving you the word,
I'm giving you the law.

01:02:21.448 --> 01:02:23.524
I'm giving you an order.

01:02:26.078 --> 01:02:30.158
Don't stop for anybody. You got that?

01:02:30.291 --> 01:02:32.912
No matter who gets it, you don't stop!

01:02:33.878 --> 01:02:37.211
Get set. You're gonna
run the Kraut in front of you.

01:02:37.339 --> 01:02:40.293
- He'll slow me up.
- You heard the lieutenant.

01:02:40.426 --> 01:02:45.420
- Can't we leave him behind?
- Division Intelligence will need him.

01:02:45.556 --> 01:02:49.091
Soon as you hear our stuff
coming over, take off.

01:03:00.278 --> 01:03:01.772
Let's go, Bernstein!

01:03:01.905 --> 01:03:05.222
Like I always said,
a fighting army is a running army.

01:03:16.586 --> 01:03:19.540
All right, now. 20-yard intervals.
Don't bunch up.

01:03:22.008 --> 01:03:26.587
Ricks! Get a move on. Let's get movin'.

01:03:26.721 --> 01:03:29.342
- You ready?
- Lieutenant, don't rush me.

01:03:29.474 --> 01:03:31.597
- Hail Mary, full of grace...
- Go!

01:03:42.862 --> 01:03:45.400
My Jesus! Mary!

01:03:51.663 --> 01:03:53.205
Snowden!

01:03:54.832 --> 01:03:56.909
Take this.

01:03:57.043 --> 01:03:59.285
- See you around, Lieutenant.
- Go.

01:04:00.171 --> 01:04:03.337
Don't you wait around too long
after I'm gone.

01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:05.837
I'll still beat you up that hill.

01:04:05.968 --> 01:04:09.171
- You're talking to a flying Toliver, Joe.
- Yeah?

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:11.344
Get out of here.

01:04:28.282 --> 01:04:29.942
Toliver!

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:03.938
The Lord is with thee.

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:09.728
Blessed art thou among women.

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:12.734
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:15.445
Amen.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.221
- Lieutenant?
- Where are you hit?

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:48.857
I don't know. The chest or lungs.

01:05:48.986 --> 01:05:51.109
Feels like bubbling.

01:05:52.865 --> 01:05:57.195
Maybe you shouldn't, Lieutenant.
You'll never make it.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.338
Lieutenant?

01:06:16.888 --> 01:06:19.593
Remember when you hit me back there?

01:06:19.724 --> 01:06:22.215
- Don't talk.
- You were right.

01:06:22.352 --> 01:06:24.558
I fouled up...

01:06:26.147 --> 01:06:28.852
But I understood what you meant.

01:06:58.805 --> 01:07:01.510
- These men, sir...
- What?

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:04.889
These men...

01:07:06.146 --> 01:07:09.016
The sergeant, poor guy...
Right in the face.

01:07:09.149 --> 01:07:10.429
Jackson!

01:07:11.902 --> 01:07:13.941
- Yes, sir.
- Shut up.

01:07:15.071 --> 01:07:18.162
- Yes, Captain, but these...
- Shut up!

01:07:24.246 --> 01:07:25.575
Captain!

01:07:26.665 --> 01:07:31.244
Sergeant Toliver is coming up the street!
He's got a German with him!

01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:38.921
Well, where'd you get the Kraut?

01:07:39.053 --> 01:07:42.753
Brought him back
from that "little ol' house".

01:07:46.936 --> 01:07:48.975
Bring him along.

01:07:50.689 --> 01:07:54.521
- Where's Lieutenant Costa?
- He was the last to run for it.

01:07:54.652 --> 01:07:59.693
I waited for him in the draw over the crest
of that hill, but he never did show up.

01:07:59.823 --> 01:08:03.239
- They must've gotten Ricks, too.
- How long did you wait?

01:08:03.369 --> 01:08:07.069
Long enough for 'em both to show
if they was gonna.

01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:11.413
OK, bring him inside.

01:08:41.197 --> 01:08:43.604
- Division?
- This is Division.

01:08:43.741 --> 01:08:46.067
This is Fox Company. We have a prisoner.

01:08:46.202 --> 01:08:48.693
What about those tanks?

01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:51.237
- How many?
- I saw two.

01:08:51.374 --> 01:08:54.743
Prisoner says there's all kind
of mechanised stuff in there.

01:08:54.877 --> 01:08:58.709
Prisoner reports at least two tanks
in La Nelle, maybe more.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.585
- Get the prisoner over to G-2.
- We'll send him by Jeep right away.

01:09:10.894 --> 01:09:13.764
Had those tanks started to move
when you pulled out?

01:09:13.897 --> 01:09:16.767
No, sir. But they sure is shooting now.

01:09:41.131 --> 01:09:46.374
How about it, Toliver?
What were Lieutenant Costa's chances?

01:09:46.511 --> 01:09:51.719
I don't know, sir. It was mighty wide open.
Feels like he just didn't make it.

01:09:52.809 --> 01:09:55.763
One of the best platoon leaders
I ever had.

01:09:55.896 --> 01:09:58.601
You stinking Nazi.

01:09:59.983 --> 01:10:02.653
- Don't do that!
- That's for Costa, you squarehead!

01:10:02.778 --> 01:10:06.072
Take it easy! He's been cooperating.

01:10:20.379 --> 01:10:23.878
- Come on, Toliver, I'll buy you a drink.
- No, thank you.

01:10:24.007 --> 01:10:27.423
- Thought you were a drinking man.
- Not now, sir.

01:10:28.387 --> 01:10:32.763
This here's bourbon, Toliver.
This is real Kentucky bourbon.

01:10:33.849 --> 01:10:37.930
I never heard of a true Southerner
refusing a Kentucky bourbon. Here.

01:10:38.062 --> 01:10:40.434
No, sir. Thanking you kindly.

01:10:41.899 --> 01:10:44.224
What's the matter, boy? Come on.

01:10:47.154 --> 01:10:52.113
Captain, down where I come from,
we dearly love our whiskey.

01:10:52.243 --> 01:10:56.371
But we don't drink with another man
unless we respect him.

01:11:01.752 --> 01:11:04.706
Well, go dry. Your loss.

01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:09.541
I've got transportation for...
What happened to him?

01:11:09.677 --> 01:11:13.093
Nothing a little more of
the same wouldn't cure.

01:11:13.222 --> 01:11:16.425
- Take him up to Division.
- Crummy, no-good Nazi.

01:11:17.476 --> 01:11:20.762
- They're hitting some of those houses!
- OK, OK!

01:11:21.856 --> 01:11:25.059
- Sound like 88s.
- You think so?

01:11:25.193 --> 01:11:27.684
- Now we got big trouble.
- They won't attack.

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:30.358
We got companies each side.
Sector's pinched off.

01:11:30.489 --> 01:11:31.984
It is not! Take a look.

01:11:32.116 --> 01:11:36.243
- You don't need to show me no map!
- They're gonna knock us out of here.

01:11:36.369 --> 01:11:38.611
That leaves two companies out on a limb.

01:11:38.747 --> 01:11:41.664
Once they've got the crossroads,
we're all up the creek!

01:11:41.791 --> 01:11:45.326
Don't get excited!
I was soldierin' when you were...

01:11:45.462 --> 01:11:48.364
The worst thing to do is get excited!

01:11:49.633 --> 01:11:51.210
Sir, them's 88s.

01:11:51.343 --> 01:11:54.047
All right, what are
we gonna do now? Huh?

01:11:58.433 --> 01:12:01.767
- Round up what's left of your platoon.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:02.854 --> 01:12:06.389
- All right, now what? What, Cooney?
- There's only one thing to do.

01:12:06.525 --> 01:12:09.609
Fall back. Miller's platoon
can hold till we make the woods.

01:12:09.736 --> 01:12:12.488
- How do they get out?
- We'll cover them.

01:12:12.614 --> 01:12:15.401
- They wouldn't have a prayer.
- I'm in command here!

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.409
- Face the facts!
- That's what I'm doing!

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:24.706
- What the hell is going on here?
- Clyde!

01:12:24.834 --> 01:12:27.372
- They've got tanks!
- Don't you "Clyde" me.

01:12:27.504 --> 01:12:29.911
- Colonel, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, all right.

01:12:30.048 --> 01:12:33.049
- Why aren't you up in La Nelle?
- I tried!

01:12:33.176 --> 01:12:35.963
- What does that mean?
- I sent a whole platoon in!

01:12:36.096 --> 01:12:39.879
That's 40 men. You got 200 men.
You sent in a platoon? What happened?

01:12:40.015 --> 01:12:42.471
They got in, but they pulled out.

01:12:42.601 --> 01:12:45.396
- How many got in?
- Five. Three got out.

01:12:45.496 --> 01:12:47.951
- I told them to stay.
- Of course they pulled out.

01:12:48.082 --> 01:12:51.498
- How many casualties?
- About 10. Five dead. Costa's missing.

01:12:51.627 --> 01:12:56.419
- He'll be OK. He's got nine lives.
- But, Clyde, I spotted those tanks.

01:12:56.548 --> 01:13:00.795
I was all set to go in. I was feeling
them out with Costa's platoon.

01:13:00.928 --> 01:13:05.222
You were ordered to get in there!
The generals thought you were in there.

01:13:05.349 --> 01:13:08.634
I told them you were in there.
What will you do now? Pull out?

01:13:08.769 --> 01:13:11.805
- You can't hold that...
- You'll stick here and hold!

01:13:11.939 --> 01:13:15.355
- How many tanks?
- There's all kinds of mechanised stuff.

01:13:15.484 --> 01:13:20.111
A task force is on its way. If the Krauts
get through, the whole battalion gets it.

01:13:20.239 --> 01:13:22.278
You hold until you're relieved.

01:13:22.408 --> 01:13:26.275
- How long will this take?
- Who cares? I want this position held.

01:13:26.412 --> 01:13:29.448
- There's something you've gotta do.
- We'll hold.

01:13:29.581 --> 01:13:32.286
It's about the command of this company.

01:13:32.418 --> 01:13:36.250
Get outta here, Woodruff.
I want to talk to your captain.

01:13:37.548 --> 01:13:38.710
Go on, move!

01:13:46.597 --> 01:13:50.097
- That's bonded liquor, Clyde.
- I want you to listen to this.

01:13:50.226 --> 01:13:53.262
Listen real closely
in case it's news to you.

01:13:53.396 --> 01:13:57.061
You're commanding this company
only as a favour to the judge.

01:13:57.191 --> 01:14:00.774
- He's always wanted a son.
- I don't want no favours.

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:06.609
You got one chance. You're in hot water.
You hold this town, I'll cover for you.

01:14:06.743 --> 01:14:09.779
But you fall back,
I'll show you what trouble means.

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:12.664
- I'll hound you into Leavenworth!
- You can count on me!

01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:16.622
No, I can't! So it boils down to
what scares you most, me or them.

01:14:16.753 --> 01:14:18.959
Listen to this!

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:22.173
You foul up, so help me
I'll crucify you!

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:31.093
You know what? I couldn't care less.

01:14:31.225 --> 01:14:33.265
You know that?

01:14:33.394 --> 01:14:36.680
You're so big. Why don't you relieve me?

01:14:41.527 --> 01:14:45.857
Yeah. Go on, send me back.

01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:48.278
Make no nevermind of me.

01:14:48.408 --> 01:14:50.650
- How I'd love to.
- All right!

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:52.529
Do it! Do it!

01:14:52.663 --> 01:14:56.910
Sure. I send you back, they'll take
a close look at you. Very close.

01:14:57.042 --> 01:14:59.615
And they'll see me perched
on your shoulder.

01:14:59.753 --> 01:15:03.751
That's right, Erskine boy.
So here you stay, here you hold.

01:15:03.882 --> 01:15:05.709
Why will I?

01:15:08.387 --> 01:15:12.005
- You all through talking?
- How I hate you.

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:16.845
Colonel, you're not gonna
leave him in command here.

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:20.145
I don't care what your opinion
of Captain Cooney is.

01:15:20.273 --> 01:15:23.524
- He's still in command. Clear?
- Very clear.

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:27.187
- Then you know what you have to do.
- I know exactly what I have to do.

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:31.154
- You double-talking me?
- I'm not double-talking anyone!

01:15:31.285 --> 01:15:35.578
If I survive this, I'm going to General
Parsons. I'll tell him the whole story.

01:15:35.706 --> 01:15:39.075
About Aachen, about Costa,
about his plan to pull out of here.

01:15:39.209 --> 01:15:41.665
I just want you to know it.

01:15:51.804 --> 01:15:55.138
When 10th Armored gets here,
I want that crossroad open.

01:16:00.479 --> 01:16:05.984
Come on, Captain. Let's go. We'll set up
at the two houses at the crossroads.

01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:08.601
We gotta hold. We gotta hold.

01:16:08.738 --> 01:16:14.242
We'll hold as long as we can, then fall
back to the church, then the courthouse.

01:16:14.368 --> 01:16:17.488
- And then what?
- That's the end of the line.

01:16:19.081 --> 01:16:21.952
Come on, get your gear.
Let's go. Come on.

01:16:25.004 --> 01:16:27.210
No, you give me that.

01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:31.883
I was soldiering when you were still
a kid. You ain't taking nothing from me.

01:16:32.011 --> 01:16:35.095
Captain, you won't find
any answers in there.

01:16:35.222 --> 01:16:38.638
- Just give me that.
- You can't find courage in a bottle.

01:16:38.768 --> 01:16:43.145
You can't buy your guts for a dollar.
Who do you think you are?

01:16:43.272 --> 01:16:46.606
You're not just careless or a coward.
You're a criminal!

01:16:46.734 --> 01:16:50.150
A criminal responsible for
the murder of at least 19 men!

01:16:50.279 --> 01:16:52.319
Give me that!

01:16:52.448 --> 01:16:53.646
There!

01:16:54.825 --> 01:16:58.573
You've got every man in this outfit
thinking the US Army is a mockery.

01:16:58.703 --> 01:17:01.953
It's not! Just this tiny,
lousy part of it.

01:17:02.082 --> 01:17:05.083
From hereon in, it's gonna be different.

01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:12.422
I'd like to go out there and stop one,
but I haven't even got the guts to...

01:17:15.011 --> 01:17:19.839
A man hasn't got the guts to live,
he hasn't got 'em to die.

01:17:19.975 --> 01:17:23.426
If you can't live, you can't die.

01:17:23.561 --> 01:17:27.855
Who wants this? I didn't ask for this.

01:17:30.694 --> 01:17:33.611
I'm different, Woodruff.

01:17:33.738 --> 01:17:35.778
I'm scared.

01:17:37.909 --> 01:17:39.985
We're all scared, Captain.

01:17:41.913 --> 01:17:45.958
I'm scared of... I'm scared of you.

01:17:46.084 --> 01:17:49.868
I'm scared of Bartlett. I'm scared...

01:17:52.048 --> 01:17:55.298
I'm scared of my father.

01:17:57.262 --> 01:17:59.669
My daddy whupped me! He whupped me!

01:17:59.805 --> 01:18:03.672
"I'm gonna whup some guts into you, boy!
I'll make a man of you!"

01:18:03.809 --> 01:18:07.012
"I'm talking to you, boy!
I'll make you a man!"

01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:17.439
And I thought that someday... someday...

01:18:22.161 --> 01:18:26.324
I woke up one morning,
and I was 30 years old.

01:18:28.751 --> 01:18:32.202
I knew that little ol' someday
was never gonna come.

01:18:34.089 --> 01:18:37.007
Never gonna be no someday.

01:18:38.427 --> 01:18:40.716
Never gonna...

01:18:52.274 --> 01:18:55.726
You stay here, Captain.
I'll take care of things.

01:19:00.741 --> 01:19:05.781
- Where is he?
- Joe. Where...? How did you get back?

01:19:07.538 --> 01:19:11.157
Where's Cooney?
They said he's here. Where?

01:19:15.672 --> 01:19:18.376
- Back there?
- Joe, listen to me.

01:19:18.925 --> 01:19:21.380
Now, don't foul yourself up.

01:19:23.429 --> 01:19:25.386
- Get outta my way.
- No.

01:19:26.057 --> 01:19:28.762
Liegert's dead! Lucas is dead!

01:19:28.893 --> 01:19:32.143
Ricks is dead! A boy I never
even talked to is dead!

01:19:32.271 --> 01:19:35.806
All on account of him!
That's one account I'm gonna square!

01:19:35.942 --> 01:19:39.726
You can't do this! He's...
I don't know. He's psycho. He's...

01:19:39.862 --> 01:19:41.902
I'm gonna count to three...

01:19:42.031 --> 01:19:46.658
You kill him, you'll go back to Battalion
under guard. I'll see to that.

01:19:46.786 --> 01:19:50.914
- Listen to me for once!
- Why should I listen to you?

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.453
You're mealy-mouthed.
You double-crossed me!

01:19:57.297 --> 01:20:00.132
- You gave me your word!
- It wasn't that simple.

01:20:00.258 --> 01:20:03.128
OK, if you want it this way! One...

01:20:04.137 --> 01:20:06.841
Harry, I'll shoot you if I have to!

01:20:06.973 --> 01:20:08.799
Two...

01:20:11.518 --> 01:20:14.721
- One of those big Kraut tanks!
- Where?

01:20:14.855 --> 01:20:19.600
It's firing point-blank into the house
where Toliver and the other guys are.

01:20:19.735 --> 01:20:23.602
- All right, Joe, how about it?
- Those guys don't have a chance!

01:20:27.826 --> 01:20:29.866
Lieutenant Costa...

01:20:31.121 --> 01:20:33.244
I thought you were dead.

01:20:35.667 --> 01:20:39.582
- Which house is it?
- At the end of the street.

01:20:45.761 --> 01:20:48.762
Can you make it on that leg there?

01:20:48.889 --> 01:20:52.305
I'll make it. There and back.

01:21:24.006 --> 01:21:26.628
Them ever-loving momsers
are trying to kill us.

01:21:26.759 --> 01:21:31.884
- We gotta get down that cellar.
- Toliver, you got a mind like a steel trap.

01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:51.113
You all right?

01:22:40.582 --> 01:22:43.073
Lieutenant! Hey, Joe!

01:22:51.134 --> 01:22:53.292
- I'm glad you...
- Where are the others?

01:22:53.428 --> 01:22:55.800
Snowden's in the cellar.
Bernstein's here.

01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:58.552
I think he's got himself a busted leg.

01:23:00.268 --> 01:23:04.348
- Get them below, out of the way.
- Look out. Here comes another one!

01:25:22.116 --> 01:25:25.568
He yells nice and loud, don't he?

01:25:25.703 --> 01:25:28.194
You know I do, you grease monkey.

01:25:37.214 --> 01:25:40.749
Whoever thought
I'd be glad of a busted leg?

01:25:40.884 --> 01:25:44.087
You know what this is, don't you?

01:25:44.221 --> 01:25:47.886
It's a one-way ticket, stateside.

01:25:48.016 --> 01:25:50.092
Want your plugs changed, too?

01:25:51.103 --> 01:25:55.729
No, thanks, Sarge.
But you can check my windshield.

01:25:55.857 --> 01:25:57.980
It's getting a little misty.

01:26:00.487 --> 01:26:04.983
Come on! They're breaking through.
We're falling back to the church.

01:26:09.329 --> 01:26:12.449
Don't leave me here. Those guys are SS.

01:26:14.626 --> 01:26:19.003
- We'll get you some kind of stretcher.
- Them SS don't take wounded prisoners.

01:26:19.131 --> 01:26:22.215
Especially when their name is Bernstein.

01:26:22.342 --> 01:26:25.427
- What we need is Superman.
- You know it, Snowden.

01:26:25.554 --> 01:26:29.967
- Or even that Joe Costa.
- Yeah, Costa. I wonder where he is.

01:26:34.605 --> 01:26:39.349
You're yellow, all of ya! We're holding
for Clyde! Come out, you cowards!

01:26:39.483 --> 01:26:43.896
Yellow! Come out! I'll fight ya!
Come out, wherever you are!

01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:47.149
We're holding for Clyde!
We're holding the town!

01:26:47.283 --> 01:26:52.739
Come on! I'll fight! Come on!
You're yellow, yellow, yellow!

01:26:57.168 --> 01:26:59.789
Come on, snap it up, will ya?

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.376
- What happened to him?
- I busted my leg.

01:27:02.506 --> 01:27:06.290
- Carry him. Come on, they're coming.
- We're trying to rig a stretcher.

01:27:06.427 --> 01:27:10.425
Hurry it up. You'll be all right, Bernstein.
I'll get up to see if it's clear.

01:27:10.556 --> 01:27:12.549
- Come on.
- Try it.

01:27:12.683 --> 01:27:17.808
You take it easy, you guys. I'm the only
guy in the world who could do this.

01:27:17.939 --> 01:27:19.730
- Do what?
- Crap out on a seven.

01:27:19.857 --> 01:27:24.234
- What do you mean?
- I bust my leg. That's a natural, right?

01:27:24.362 --> 01:27:28.110
- Stateside for certain.
- So I win, so I pick up the chips.

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:31.028
And what are we playing for?
A drop-dead pill.

01:27:35.623 --> 01:27:37.699
I almost wish I wasn't wounded.

01:27:37.833 --> 01:27:40.703
Come on, hurry it up.

01:27:40.835 --> 01:27:43.872
What's going on here?
Where are you men going?

01:27:44.005 --> 01:27:48.418
- Nobody's running out! We're holding!
- We'll hold at the church and courthouse!

01:27:48.551 --> 01:27:52.086
We weren't told we were!
You ain't telling me, I'm telling you!

01:27:52.222 --> 01:27:54.428
- He's nuts.
- Get back!

01:27:54.557 --> 01:27:56.680
Cooney, you're blocking progress!

01:27:59.562 --> 01:28:03.607
Get back there! You're yellow!
All of you! Get back there!

01:28:03.733 --> 01:28:07.565
Too late. They're all around the place.
Get back down.

01:28:10.282 --> 01:28:14.196
Geradeaus. Die erste Kompanie
zu den rechten Häusern.

01:28:14.327 --> 01:28:18.076
Ich soll auf
die amerikanischen Panzer aufpassen.

01:28:20.250 --> 01:28:21.958
Wo willst du denn hin?

01:28:22.085 --> 01:28:24.327
Ich wollte mal im Keller nachgucken.

01:28:24.462 --> 01:28:26.122
Dass du dich besaufen kannst?

01:28:26.256 --> 01:28:27.964
Nur nachsehen, das ist alles.

01:28:28.091 --> 01:28:31.341
Mach dir keine Sorgen,
da ist kein Schnaps mehr übrig.

01:28:33.888 --> 01:28:37.174
Wenn noch welcher da wäre,
würde ich ja selbst runtergehen.

01:28:37.309 --> 01:28:39.100
Komm.

01:29:01.665 --> 01:29:04.452
We're cut off here.

01:29:04.585 --> 01:29:06.743
I'm aware of that, Captain.

01:29:08.088 --> 01:29:11.671
The way I see it, we're trapped.
This situation's hopeless.

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:15.004
- Sh!
- There's only one thing to do.

01:29:15.137 --> 01:29:17.675
- And what's that?
- Surrender.

01:29:17.806 --> 01:29:22.267
- The Geneva Convention...
- Listen. They don't even know we're here.

01:29:22.394 --> 01:29:26.724
As officer in charge, I'm still
the one giving the orders...

01:29:26.857 --> 01:29:29.265
- You're sick.
- ...and don't you forget it!

01:29:30.855 --> 01:29:32.106
Shut up!

01:29:32.237 --> 01:29:36.567
If the SS can't march Bernstein back,
you know exactly what they'll do.

01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:38.907
I'm doing the officer-like thing.

01:29:40.245 --> 01:29:42.285
I'm trying to save lives.

01:30:11.150 --> 01:30:12.526
Oh...

01:30:14.404 --> 01:30:15.566
Cooney.

01:30:28.459 --> 01:30:32.327
- Joe.
- Your arm, Joe.

01:30:39.595 --> 01:30:41.220
Please...

01:30:44.058 --> 01:30:46.098
Dear God...

01:30:47.687 --> 01:30:52.734
just one minute... more.

01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:09.271
OK... Cooney.

01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:15.994
Time...

01:31:19.083 --> 01:31:20.957
Time to settle up.

01:31:39.061 --> 01:31:40.390
God...

01:31:47.653 --> 01:31:49.776
give me the strength...

01:31:54.118 --> 01:31:56.739
just... just to do this.

01:31:57.705 --> 01:31:59.447
I gotta...

01:32:01.207 --> 01:32:03.366
I gotta...

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:09.127
I gotta...

01:32:19.225 --> 01:32:23.270
Please, God. I pray...

01:33:18.450 --> 01:33:21.534
Father, may I go to hell...

01:33:23.789 --> 01:33:25.828
before I...

01:33:54.194 --> 01:33:57.065
He didn't mean what he said, God.

01:33:57.197 --> 01:33:59.237
He didn't mean it.

01:34:00.826 --> 01:34:02.949
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:34:03.912 --> 01:34:07.660
I didn't know one man
could bleed that much.

01:34:14.422 --> 01:34:18.502
Well, that being over, I think
we'll just carry on as planned.

01:34:20.219 --> 01:34:24.431
You take one more step up those stairs,
and I'll kill you.

01:34:26.601 --> 01:34:30.645
Hold on, boy.
Let's not fly off the handle here.

01:34:34.942 --> 01:34:37.184
Let's calm down.

01:34:38.946 --> 01:34:41.318
Who said anything about the stairs?

01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:47.658
I was just... I was just
thinking of the welfare...

01:34:49.165 --> 01:34:51.407
Get over there!

01:34:54.462 --> 01:34:57.582
Now who's runnin' the show, eh?

01:34:57.715 --> 01:35:00.586
I'm still in command here.

01:35:00.718 --> 01:35:06.721
And the first wisecracker that gets out
of line is gonna get it right in the head.

01:35:07.683 --> 01:35:10.934
How about it? Any takers?

01:35:16.691 --> 01:35:18.234
No.

01:35:27.869 --> 01:35:29.328
Captain!

01:35:48.473 --> 01:35:52.850
- Hey, the noise. What about the Krauts?
- Take a look.

01:35:59.401 --> 01:36:02.152
Good shot. From the hip.

01:36:10.954 --> 01:36:12.579
Sergeant...

01:36:15.083 --> 01:36:19.709
if we ever get out of here,
place me under arrest.

01:36:22.047 --> 01:36:25.630
I don't see no Krauts at all, sir.
I'll check outside.

01:36:28.429 --> 01:36:31.679
- Did you hear me?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:36:31.807 --> 01:36:36.386
- The Krauts got the captain.
- Absolutely.

01:36:41.775 --> 01:36:46.651
They got him coming through the door.
I seen it. Jackson here seen it, too.

01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:50.232
That's right, I seen it... saw it.

01:36:50.367 --> 01:36:56.406
If ever a man needed killing, it's that
no-good putrid piece of trash lying there.

01:36:57.975 --> 01:37:01.558
He's gone, Lieutenant.
Let's just all forget about it.

01:37:01.687 --> 01:37:06.185
Now, look here, son...
I mean, Lieutenant.

01:37:07.902 --> 01:37:12.943
What's happened here...
I mean, what's really happened,

01:37:13.073 --> 01:37:15.861
and how it's gonna
sound in a court martial...

01:37:15.993 --> 01:37:18.401
Them's two different things.

01:37:18.537 --> 01:37:21.241
Those armchair officers
will railroad you.

01:37:21.372 --> 01:37:24.290
I got faith in justice, Lieutenant,
but the army,

01:37:24.417 --> 01:37:27.868
well, it just got no sentiment.

01:37:28.004 --> 01:37:33.343
Speaking of justice, shooting him was
about the most just thing I've ever seen.

01:37:33.468 --> 01:37:35.591
He was about to get us all killed.

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:41.390
Some sharp operator bucking for his
majority will make you look like a maniac!

01:37:45.313 --> 01:37:49.856
Supposing Costa had done it...
had lived long enough to do it.

01:37:49.984 --> 01:37:52.440
You wouldn't have turned him in.

01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:59.904
- Costa didn't do it. I did it.
- That so?

01:38:32.234 --> 01:38:35.270
Now who killed him? You or me?

01:38:35.404 --> 01:38:38.855
Or me? Or Jackson there?

01:38:40.784 --> 01:38:42.990
He was already dead.

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:47.034
How do you know, Lieutenant?
You can't be sure.

01:38:48.417 --> 01:38:54.004
Man, he sure caught a storm of lead
at the top of them stairs, didn't he?

01:38:54.131 --> 01:38:58.923
Yeah, six fat Huns
driving a 1919 Stutz Bear Cat.

01:39:00.095 --> 01:39:01.210
- Tanks!
- No.

01:39:01.346 --> 01:39:04.964
Yes. But they're ours! The 10th
Armored's here! The Krauts are gone!

01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:07.425
Yonkers, here I come!

01:39:17.738 --> 01:39:21.772
So long, Joe. You were a real soldier.

01:39:22.409 --> 01:39:24.615
Nice man.

01:39:25.704 --> 01:39:29.405
I sure hope things turn out the way
he would've wanted them to.

01:39:30.833 --> 01:39:34.000
Come on, the colonel's on his way over.

01:39:34.128 --> 01:39:37.497
You hear that?
The colonel's coming. You hear me, sir?

01:39:37.632 --> 01:39:41.416
He'll be sorry about how them Krauts
got poor Captain Cooney.

01:39:41.552 --> 01:39:44.470
He'll be mad at them
for what they did to his friend.

01:39:44.597 --> 01:39:46.755
The fortunes of war, Lieutenant.

01:39:49.143 --> 01:39:52.061
Lieutenant, how did you get cut off?

01:39:52.188 --> 01:39:56.933
We were trying to get a wounded man out.
They came up faster than I expected.

01:39:57.068 --> 01:40:01.017
Bad judgment. You got a great company.
I asked them to hold and they did.

01:40:01.155 --> 01:40:04.156
- Who is that? Costa?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:04.283 --> 01:40:06.821
Where's your captain?
I want to congratulate him.

01:40:06.953 --> 01:40:09.194
He's over here, sir.

01:40:14.126 --> 01:40:18.539
I'm putting you in command. Don't get
separated from the company again.

01:40:18.673 --> 01:40:22.373
- What happened to him?
- He was shot.

01:40:22.510 --> 01:40:23.589
Down here?

01:40:23.719 --> 01:40:28.512
He tried to get back to the company,
but only made it to the top of the stairs.

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:32.969
- Died like a real soldier, did he?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:33.104 --> 01:40:35.309
He certainly did, sir.

01:40:37.607 --> 01:40:40.644
- You hurt bad, son?
- No. A million-dollar wound.

01:40:40.777 --> 01:40:43.980
- Good deal. Give the States my regards.
- Yes, sir.

01:40:44.114 --> 01:40:48.277
Send out the grave detail and
get this man over to Battalion A.

01:40:55.250 --> 01:40:58.167
See you later, Lieutenant?

01:40:58.295 --> 01:41:02.873
I'll notify Battalion and Division
about your being the new CO.

01:41:03.008 --> 01:41:06.792
- All right, sir?
- All right?

01:41:13.852 --> 01:41:14.931
OK.

01:41:16.062 --> 01:41:18.850
See you later.

01:41:32.162 --> 01:41:34.735
You see it personally, Woodruff?

01:41:35.874 --> 01:41:37.119
Yes, sir.

01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:41.579
- He was at the top of the stairs, huh?
- Yes, sir.

01:41:41.712 --> 01:41:45.792
- Then he rolled back down here.
- Yes, sir.

01:41:46.717 --> 01:41:51.509
You're a good officer, Woodruff.
I'm glad to see you got this company.

01:41:51.639 --> 01:41:56.514
Maybe I'll put through a field promotion
for you. I want a captain in command.

01:41:59.355 --> 01:42:01.846
If that's what you want, sir.

01:42:01.982 --> 01:42:05.398
Funny what you were
saying to me before about, uh...

01:42:05.527 --> 01:42:08.943
going to General Parsons
over something or other.

01:42:09.073 --> 01:42:14.613
A man'll say all kinds of things, do all
kinds of things under strain, won't he?

01:42:16.622 --> 01:42:19.742
But I never heard you.

01:42:19.917 --> 01:42:22.538
So the old judge wanted a son, huh?

01:42:25.756 --> 01:42:29.006
Looks like he had to lose
one to get one.

01:42:29.134 --> 01:42:31.210
You know what I'm gonna do?

01:42:31.345 --> 01:42:34.548
I'll put Erskine through
for Distinguished Service Cross.

01:42:34.682 --> 01:42:38.382
I'll write up the papers and send them
around for your signature...

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:40.179
Captain Woodruff.

01:42:40.312 --> 01:42:43.098
You have no objection, have you?

01:42:43.231 --> 01:42:46.481
Old Erskine died like a hero, didn't he?

01:42:49.696 --> 01:42:55.485
- You're gonna push me too far.
- Woodruff, it's a little piece of ribbon.

01:42:55.618 --> 01:42:58.785
What's that against a rope
around a dead man's neck?

01:43:00.915 --> 01:43:04.580
It's not a dead man's neck, Colonel!
It's mine!

01:43:04.711 --> 01:43:07.498
Yes, my neck!

01:43:07.630 --> 01:43:11.462
- Don't get excited.
- You played it too far. Way too far.

01:43:11.593 --> 01:43:15.839
Now it's phoney medals for the judge
with my signature on the citation!

01:43:15.972 --> 01:43:20.266
It's not gonna be that way.
I killed him. And that's no simple...

01:43:20.393 --> 01:43:24.521
You're high-strung, Woodruff!
You need a couple of weeks' rest.

01:43:26.357 --> 01:43:30.189
Maybe I'll put through a little leave
for you. A couple of weeks in Paris...

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:33.736
- Down here.
- Come back a new man.

01:43:37.368 --> 01:43:40.155
There they are. One in each room.

01:43:49.796 --> 01:43:52.881
Come back with your new bars on.
Your own company.

01:43:53.008 --> 01:43:56.258
Life can be very pleasant, Harry.
Even in a war.

01:44:00.974 --> 01:44:04.675
Take a look at me, Colonel.
Take a good look at me!

01:44:06.188 --> 01:44:09.604
I may have pulled that trigger,
but you aimed the gun.

01:44:09.733 --> 01:44:12.687
You set this whole thing up
so it could happen.

01:44:12.819 --> 01:44:16.153
- They'll smell you out on this.
- Nobody will smell a thing.

01:44:16.281 --> 01:44:21.358
You got the high hand now, son,
the big cards. You'll play it smart.

01:44:28.210 --> 01:44:30.915
Your worries are over.
The captain's gone.

01:44:44.851 --> 01:44:50.771
He was a good man. Don't see no reason
why we can't get a citation for him, too.

01:44:51.941 --> 01:44:53.934
- That makes it all OK?
- Get flexible!

01:44:54.068 --> 01:44:56.737
You know what a court martial
would do with this?

01:44:56.862 --> 01:44:59.947
So what are you gonna do,
let a dead man destroy your life?

01:45:00.074 --> 01:45:02.647
Understand, there's no hard feelings.

01:45:03.411 --> 01:45:06.495
I know you, Harry. You got horse sense.

01:45:09.166 --> 01:45:12.286
You won't tell General Parsons a thing.

01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:14.745
You got too much to lose.

01:45:23.890 --> 01:45:25.929
See you around, Harry.

01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:33.203
You know what I've gotta do, Joe.

01:46:34.876 --> 01:46:36.952
You'd do the same thing.

01:47:06.115 --> 01:47:10.409
This is Fragile Fox One.
I want Division Headquarters.

01:47:10.536 --> 01:47:12.612
This is Division.

01:47:12.746 --> 01:47:17.871
This is Lieutenant Harold Woodruff,
White Battalion, 2nd Regiment.

01:47:18.002 --> 01:47:21.418
- I want to talk to General Parsons.
- Will you wait, please?

01:47:21.547 --> 01:47:23.586
Yes, I'll wait.

01:47:28.596 --> 01:47:32.428
General Parsons speaking. Hello? Hello?

01:47:32.558 --> 01:47:34.965
This is Lieutenant Harold Woodruff.
