00:02.583 --> 00:06.082
_

00:08.538 --> 00:10.755
bearing 0-4-5.

00:11.107 --> 00:14.141
Steady 10 knots.

00:14.166 --> 00:16.550
I can't see.

00:18.197 --> 00:20.722
Sir? Sir?

00:20.747 --> 00:22.956
Holding course, steady.

00:22.982 --> 00:25.013
- Depth... sonar?
- Captain?

00:25.038 --> 00:27.205
Bearing 0-4-5...

00:34.868 --> 00:38.130
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

00:43.590 --> 00:45.590
Captain?

00:45.615 --> 00:48.115
Oh, God.

00:48.140 --> 00:50.841
Oh, God. Oh, God.

00:52.638 --> 00:55.263
What the hell is going on, Sean?

00:55.288 --> 00:56.990
Everyone's dead but us.

00:57.014 --> 00:59.434
We lost the captain. We're all alone.

00:59.645 --> 01:02.857
There's no answer from the base at faslane.

01:02.882 --> 01:04.670
How we gonna get home?

01:05.308 --> 01:06.726
Sean!

01:06.751 --> 01:08.617
We'll get home, bruv.

01:08.793 --> 01:10.242
How do you know?

01:11.874 --> 01:14.207
Because I do.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.180 --> 02:34.596
Hope.

02:35.075 --> 02:38.076
Such a rarified concept these days.

02:38.101 --> 02:42.369
High in demand... And short in supply.

02:42.605 --> 02:45.523
I'm enjoying recording these logs again.

02:45.525 --> 02:48.326
Until recently, I had given up on them.

02:48.603 --> 02:50.521
With no connection to the outside world,

02:50.546 --> 02:54.014
they were serving as little
more than just a diary.

02:54.039 --> 02:57.650
But now with the satellite
network up and running,

02:57.782 --> 03:01.426
they have become my trusty carrier pigeons.

03:02.015 --> 03:05.025
I am happy to report that
the cure has landed safely

03:05.050 --> 03:07.331
in labs across the country and in Europe,

03:07.356 --> 03:11.287
and I am on my way to you, Dr. hunter,

03:11.312 --> 03:14.045
my friend, my mentor.

03:14.185 --> 03:16.045
We'll be stopping first in Savannah

03:16.070 --> 03:17.279
to set up a lab there,

03:17.305 --> 03:19.889
before heading down to you
in Florida with the cure.

03:19.914 --> 03:20.936
As promised,

03:20.961 --> 03:23.709
I am uploading my data
to the secured satellite,

03:23.734 --> 03:27.397
and I would love for you to take
a look at the work we've done,

03:27.422 --> 03:30.340
and get your thoughts on
faster methods for replication.

03:30.365 --> 03:34.747
Because time, as you well
know, is of the essence,

03:35.099 --> 03:37.850
and millions still
continue to live at risk.

03:38.055 --> 03:41.774
So take of yourself, old friend,

03:41.799 --> 03:44.749
and I'll be seeing you shortly.

03:45.182 --> 03:48.017
The door to the autoclave still won't shut,

03:48.042 --> 03:49.944
and we're nearly out of ethanol.

03:49.969 --> 03:53.043
I know. We've been running
the equipment at full capacity.

03:53.068 --> 03:55.654
And with what those troopers
did to us in Baltimore,

03:55.679 --> 03:58.046
it's a wonder that
anything is working at all.

03:58.524 --> 04:02.558
Excuse me, ma'am. You need to see this.

04:03.761 --> 04:07.170
Hospital ship <i> U.S.N.S. Solace</i>
departed naval station Norfolk

04:07.195 --> 04:08.944
two weeks ago bearing south-southeast.

04:08.969 --> 04:10.719
- Destination?
- That's just it, sir.

04:10.744 --> 04:12.451
The harbor master log doesn't show one.

04:12.476 --> 04:14.451
So it headed out to sea
to avoid the pandemic,

04:14.476 --> 04:16.639
maybe create a safe hospital offshore.

04:16.664 --> 04:17.678
That's what I thought, sir,

04:17.702 --> 04:19.076
but then I checked the ship's manifest,

04:19.414 --> 04:21.194
and aside from a skeleton crew from

04:21.219 --> 04:23.185
the military sealift
command to run the ship,

04:23.210 --> 04:25.085
there were only 15 doctors on board.

04:25.110 --> 04:27.037
I mean, that's well below
reduced operating status.

04:27.062 --> 04:28.842
With the plague, maybe
that's all that's left.

04:28.867 --> 04:30.155
Even so, Master Chief,

04:30.180 --> 04:32.347
the <i> Solace</i> was
especially retrofitted

04:32.372 --> 04:33.412
before going underway...

04:33.437 --> 04:36.322
Negative pressure equipment,
incubators, thermocyclers.

04:36.347 --> 04:39.252
Precisely the tools one
needs to make a biolab.

04:39.277 --> 04:41.912
15 doctors, all that equipment...

04:41.937 --> 04:43.850
Think that's the missing lab from Norfolk?

04:43.875 --> 04:46.686
It has to be. Put on a
ship and moved offshore.

04:48.119 --> 04:50.686
- Let's call 'em.
- Aye, sir.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.695
They brought enough equipment
on that hospital ship

04:53.720 --> 04:56.137
to build a lab three
times the size of ours.

04:56.162 --> 05:00.164
With the cure, they can produce
tens of thousands of doses a day

05:00.189 --> 05:02.383
and get them directly to
the people who need it.

05:02.408 --> 05:04.408
South America, Europe.

05:05.030 --> 05:07.172
We're gettin' another ship.

05:26.662 --> 05:30.862
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.Addic7ed.Com -

05:53.003 --> 05:54.753
gentlemen.

05:55.404 --> 05:57.342
Now I know how much all of
you like carrying a load,

05:57.367 --> 05:58.834
but the truth is we
could use a little help.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.129
So I want to introduce you to
two of our new team members.

06:01.154 --> 06:02.737
Both of these sailors were part of

06:02.762 --> 06:05.318
the Navy's special warfare
joint operation training program

06:05.343 --> 06:06.068
in Norfolk

06:06.093 --> 06:07.928
when shit hit the rotors
about three months ago.

06:07.953 --> 06:09.826
They volunteered to join
us on our mission south.

06:09.851 --> 06:11.849
Senior Chief Taylor, Royal Australian Navy.

06:11.874 --> 06:13.084
You can call me Wolf.

06:13.109 --> 06:14.324
He is the real deal.

06:14.349 --> 06:16.662
A diver, E.O.D. expert,
and all-around operator.

06:16.687 --> 06:19.262
- Proud to join the team.
- Welcome aboard.

06:19.287 --> 06:21.912
- Hey, Wolf. Tex.
- Hey.

06:21.970 --> 06:24.022
And this is lieutenant Ravit Bivas.

06:24.047 --> 06:25.428
Israeli defense forces...

06:25.453 --> 06:27.529
- Expert diver and intelligence operator.
- Hey.

06:27.995 --> 06:31.163
Wow. We are a regular
coalition of the living.

06:31.188 --> 06:33.355
That's right. Now let's make
our new friends feel welcome,

06:33.380 --> 06:34.592
show 'em the ropes.

06:34.617 --> 06:36.033
That is all.

06:37.054 --> 06:39.221
- Hey, man.
- Lieutenant Burk, Carlton.

06:39.246 --> 06:40.397
Yeah, sounds great.

06:40.422 --> 06:42.389
You know, when I was deployed in the Gulf,

06:42.414 --> 06:44.130
I spent some time outside Tel Aviv,

06:44.155 --> 06:45.741
a town called Gi-Va-Tayim.

06:45.766 --> 06:47.985
- Givatayim.
- Right.

06:48.010 --> 06:49.476
Congratulations.

06:51.007 --> 06:52.977
Hey, Wolf, let me ask you a question.

06:53.002 --> 06:55.133
Do you think them Navy
regs on fraternization

06:55.158 --> 06:56.407
apply to foreigners?

06:56.809 --> 06:58.643
You better check the rule book.

06:58.808 --> 07:00.557
I'm just being hospitable.

07:00.582 --> 07:01.539
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

07:03.222 --> 07:05.539
I say again, this is <i>
U.S.S. Nathan James</i>

07:05.564 --> 07:08.445
hailing <i> U.S.N.S. Solace</i>
T-AH21 in the green

07:08.470 --> 07:10.504
on sat-hi-com. How
do you copy? Over.

07:13.443 --> 07:15.026
Still nothing, sir.

07:15.051 --> 07:17.750
Sir, I'm assuming that if
they took the lab from Norfolk,

07:17.775 --> 07:19.203
they brought their call sign with them.

07:19.346 --> 07:21.680
You try hailing them on
Navy red or fleet tac?

07:21.705 --> 07:22.899
Yes, sir. No joy.

07:22.939 --> 07:24.758
Nothing on their Mars
station frequencies either.

07:24.783 --> 07:27.438
Gator, hospital ships still
use their beacons don't they?

07:27.463 --> 07:29.219
To announce their
presence as noncombatants?

07:29.244 --> 07:31.649
Yes, sir. Prerecorded voice
broadcasts once per hour,

07:31.674 --> 07:33.790
that's the rule, but the
range is over the horizon,

07:33.814 --> 07:35.114
and we're not picking anything up.

07:35.139 --> 07:37.055
Well, they couldn't have gone too far.

07:38.471 --> 07:39.887
Bridge, this is the captain.

07:39.912 --> 07:42.880
Come to course 1-7-5,
all engines ahead full.

07:43.382 --> 07:46.988
Harbor master log said they
went south by southeast.

07:47.974 --> 07:49.524
- Let's find 'em.
- Aye, sir.

07:59.496 --> 08:02.029
Hospital ship's nearly
twice the size of ours.

08:02.054 --> 08:04.714
It's a 70-foot climb from
the water up to the o2 deck,

08:04.739 --> 08:06.081
there you go.

08:06.106 --> 08:08.239
Steam powered, one screw.

08:08.904 --> 08:10.628
Yeah, but no guns.

08:10.653 --> 08:11.985
I'll take a smallboy any day.

08:12.010 --> 08:14.261
Hell, yeah. Built to fight, just like us.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.440
Hoo-yah.

08:16.465 --> 08:18.878
That's nice. Keep that left hand up.

08:18.903 --> 08:20.441
- I know.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.

08:20.465 --> 08:23.241
Come on! You punch like a girl.

08:26.438 --> 08:28.571
Nice. Nice.

08:35.061 --> 08:36.424
Caught you slipping, buddy.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.626
Come on, Tex.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.018
They're just friends, by the way.

08:43.395 --> 08:45.956
Had a little convo with Wolf.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.778
All right, not that you're interested.

08:49.803 --> 08:52.670
Whoa, hey, hey. What'd he say?

08:52.695 --> 08:56.614
He says she's like a sister to him.

08:56.639 --> 08:57.855
Yeah?

08:57.880 --> 08:59.540
Just don't break her heart.

08:59.565 --> 09:01.548
You don't wanna tangle
with the big brother.

09:04.511 --> 09:05.619
Ooh.

09:05.644 --> 09:08.090
The United States
hospital ship <i>Solace</i>

09:08.115 --> 09:09.975
transmitting in the
clear without encryption

09:10.000 --> 09:13.123
or secret codes as required by article 34

09:13.148 --> 09:14.597
of the second Geneva convention

09:14.622 --> 09:16.646
for the amelioration of the condition of

09:16.672 --> 09:18.624
the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked members

09:18.649 --> 09:20.309
of the armed forces at
sea. United States...

09:31.018 --> 09:33.515
It's a diagram of the
grace, sister ship of Solace.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.390
From what I understand,
they're practically identical.

09:35.521 --> 09:38.132
They most likely
constructed their labs here,

09:38.157 --> 09:39.991
two levels below the o2 machine.

09:40.017 --> 09:42.351
Best place for negative
pressure and ventilation.

09:42.376 --> 09:44.541
You'll want to check... excuse me.

09:44.566 --> 09:46.266
Sir, we picked up <i>Solace's</i> beacon.

09:46.291 --> 09:48.836
O.O.D. reports they are in
range of bridge-to-bridge,

09:48.861 --> 09:50.794
but they're not answering
our hails on any channel.

09:50.818 --> 09:52.004
They still moving?

09:52.029 --> 09:53.473
It appears not, sir.

09:53.988 --> 09:56.590
Why does this story sound familiar?

09:56.615 --> 09:58.691
This bloody virus...

10:00.466 --> 10:01.691
Well, at the very least,

10:01.716 --> 10:03.790
we'll be able to salvage their lab, right?

10:04.944 --> 10:06.567
That'll be our mission.

10:06.592 --> 10:08.489
Once we get the ship secured,

10:08.514 --> 10:10.231
you can jump on board and take stock.

10:10.256 --> 10:12.432
Then off to Florida and Georgia.
The labs are waiting for us.

10:12.457 --> 10:15.245
I'll alert the team, bring
you right up alongside.

10:15.270 --> 10:16.846
Master Chief.

10:18.817 --> 10:21.821
They put themselves out to sea,

10:21.846 --> 10:23.620
waiting for us.

10:25.507 --> 10:27.821
And we were late.

11:02.654 --> 11:06.039
So, Wolf. Badass name. Who gave you that?

11:06.088 --> 11:08.114
My mother.

11:10.222 --> 11:11.521
All right, cool.

11:13.104 --> 11:16.090
Yeah, you're probably
used to your tavor rifle.

11:16.115 --> 11:18.137
Mp7's better for close in fighting,

11:18.163 --> 11:19.646
but could be a little tricky.

11:23.810 --> 11:26.938
Yeah, guess you got it.

11:30.937 --> 11:33.437
Just didn't see it coming.

11:33.462 --> 11:36.550
I was working joint operations
down in little creek.

11:36.938 --> 11:38.638
Yeah, things got bad real fast.

11:38.663 --> 11:41.631
I mean, one day, they're talking
about a few isolated cases

11:41.656 --> 11:43.131
of this crazy flu.

11:43.156 --> 11:44.015
The next thing,

11:44.039 --> 11:45.838
there's general havoc and
the airports are closed.

11:46.291 --> 11:48.575
We went from setting up hospitals

11:48.600 --> 11:50.334
to enforcing quarantines

11:50.360 --> 11:52.187
to running for our bloody lives.

11:52.332 --> 11:55.371
Nobody knew which way was up.

11:55.442 --> 11:57.475
I always wondered how
it all went down here.

11:57.845 --> 11:59.585
Yeah, most of the big cities in Australia

11:59.610 --> 12:01.059
were hit pretty hard, too.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.061
Never managed to call home.

12:03.086 --> 12:04.928
My brothers, my sister.

12:04.967 --> 12:07.772
This place isn't exactly home, but...

12:08.153 --> 12:09.519
You've got a family here.

12:09.739 --> 12:12.656
Appreciate that, Miller, really.

12:14.127 --> 12:16.806
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

12:21.506 --> 12:23.923
Ciws is down,

12:24.065 --> 12:25.565
but we'll have S.C.A.T. teams ready for you

12:25.590 --> 12:26.889
if you need support.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.194
All right, well, we'll be ready.

12:29.219 --> 12:31.147
- Yeah.
- Mm.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.882
I, uh, saw your new team members.

12:36.442 --> 12:40.310
Come on. Jealousy is a useless emotion.

12:40.335 --> 12:43.970
I agree. I'm just saying all
the girls are talking about

12:43.995 --> 12:45.862
the man from down under.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.759
- G'day.
- G'day.

12:57.545 --> 13:00.495
This is United States warship 1-5-1

13:00.520 --> 13:01.499
on your starboard bow,

13:01.524 --> 13:03.566
hailing you over channel 1-6, over.

13:03.591 --> 13:06.594
- Port and starboard lookout watches set, sir.
- Very well.

13:06.665 --> 13:08.699
O.O.D. starboard R.H.I.B. is away.

13:08.849 --> 13:09.922
Very well.

13:09.947 --> 13:11.672
United States hospital ship <i> Solace,</i>

13:11.697 --> 13:13.797
this is United States warship 1-5-1

13:13.822 --> 13:15.288
on your starboard bow...

13:19.190 --> 13:20.857
I hold <i> Solace</i> at all stop

13:20.859 --> 13:22.825
with slight bearing drift to port.

13:28.361 --> 13:31.511
O.O.D. recommends steady course 1-8-0

13:31.536 --> 13:33.536
maintaining 600 yards C.P.A.

13:33.561 --> 13:36.822
Very well, helmsman.
Steady course 1-8-0.

13:39.753 --> 13:44.843
1-8-0, all engines ahead
1/3 for 3 knots, aye.

13:47.469 --> 13:51.168
All right, Tiger Team... Tex, Ravit, Burk.

13:51.193 --> 13:53.643
Start aft and starboard,
clear your way to the lab.

13:53.668 --> 13:56.168
The rest of you on me.
We go port and forward.

13:56.193 --> 13:57.832
You come across anyone still alive,

13:57.865 --> 14:00.168
save who you can with the
doses you are carrying.

14:00.193 --> 14:01.801
- Am I clear?
- On it, sir.

14:01.826 --> 14:02.887
- Aye, sir.
- This way.

14:02.912 --> 14:04.996
Let's find that lab, Tiger Team.

14:07.009 --> 14:09.489
<i>Nathan James,</i> this is Vulture Team.

14:09.514 --> 14:10.371
Radio check.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.466
Reading you loud and clear.

14:12.491 --> 14:15.848
Expect radio drop-off once we
get in the skin of the ship.

14:15.873 --> 14:17.325
Next check in five mics.

14:17.350 --> 14:19.600
Roger that. Good luck.

14:41.689 --> 14:45.635
So the vaccine your doctor
gave me, you sure it works?

14:45.660 --> 14:47.076
Oh, yeah.

14:47.422 --> 14:50.065
I wouldn't be here if it didn't.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.606
Amazing.

14:51.631 --> 14:53.900
Burk, what do you see?

14:53.926 --> 14:55.862
A whole lot of nothin', sir.

14:56.227 --> 14:57.693
Same here.

14:57.718 --> 15:00.086
No sign of life.

15:00.111 --> 15:01.860
Or death.

15:03.515 --> 15:05.213
Where the hell did everyone go?

15:10.075 --> 15:13.381
Sir? It's been five minutes, sir.

15:16.307 --> 15:17.939
Vulture Team, this is the bridge,

15:17.964 --> 15:19.369
radio check. Radio check.

15:19.394 --> 15:20.963
Bridge, Vul... Team.

15:20.988 --> 15:23.202
Hey, no... life.

15:24.652 --> 15:27.557
Vulture Team, say again.
Your last was garbled.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.594
Bridge, Vulture Team, I say again,

15:29.619 --> 15:31.168
no sign of...

15:31.444 --> 15:33.228
Vulture Team, say again.

15:38.075 --> 15:40.158
What's going on in here?

15:40.855 --> 15:43.973
For me?

15:43.998 --> 15:46.191
Sir, you hear that?

15:46.216 --> 15:47.449
Over there.

15:55.540 --> 15:58.722
Hey, Stella, you know what?

15:58.747 --> 16:00.386
Inside the cake is ice cream, too.

16:00.411 --> 16:02.019
Chocolate mint.

16:06.332 --> 16:07.534
You do or you don't?

16:07.559 --> 16:09.291
Do.

16:16.438 --> 16:18.605
Okay, say good-bye.

16:18.630 --> 16:20.481
Bye.

16:25.166 --> 16:27.416
Found a body.

16:31.133 --> 16:33.324
- Virus?
- I don't think so.

16:34.248 --> 16:35.816
Two shots to the back, one to the head,

16:35.841 --> 16:37.660
high-powered weapon.

16:37.685 --> 16:39.230
Blood's still wet.

16:40.058 --> 16:41.724
More blood over here.

16:41.749 --> 16:44.800
<i>Nathan James,</i> Vulture
Team, this is Tiger, do you copy?

16:44.825 --> 16:46.574
Do you copy?

16:47.963 --> 16:50.004
Commo, bridge. I need a better signal.

16:50.029 --> 16:51.520
Vulture Team.

16:51.545 --> 16:54.043
<i>Nathan James, Nathan James.</i>

17:16.883 --> 17:19.266
Holy mother.

17:28.785 --> 17:33.125
They were lined up and executed.

17:38.257 --> 17:39.976
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

17:40.071 --> 17:42.288
U.S. Navy. What's going on here?

17:42.313 --> 17:44.263
Be careful.

17:45.467 --> 17:48.502
They're still on the ship.

17:59.957 --> 18:01.525
Tiger Team, be advised,

18:01.550 --> 18:04.355
hostiles operating on board
this ship. Location unknown.

18:04.380 --> 18:05.473
Do you copy?

18:05.498 --> 18:07.255
I... we... we got...

18:07.280 --> 18:08.980
12 <i> Solace</i> crew, K.I.A.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.554
Burk... read me.

18:10.579 --> 18:12.897
Vulture Team, we got a
dozen Solace crew down.

18:12.922 --> 18:14.772
Believe hostiles may still be on board.

18:14.797 --> 18:16.651
I say again, hostiles may be on board.

18:16.653 --> 18:19.320
Vulture Team, do you copy?

18:19.322 --> 18:20.454
Team, be advised...

18:20.479 --> 18:24.468
Ship. Again, hostiles
operating on board this ship.

18:24.493 --> 18:25.747
Set general quarters.

18:25.772 --> 18:29.718
General quarters. General quarters.

18:29.743 --> 18:31.726
All hands, man your battlestations.

18:31.751 --> 18:33.811
General quarters is up and
forward to the starboard side.

18:33.836 --> 18:35.431
Down and aft to the port side.

18:35.456 --> 18:36.744
The reason for general quarters

18:36.768 --> 18:38.501
is hostile activity on board south.

18:38.526 --> 18:40.024
Tex, Burk, do you read me?

18:40.291 --> 18:42.696
Sir, they boarded about 20 minutes ago.

18:42.728 --> 18:44.251
How many? At least a dozen.

18:44.276 --> 18:45.696
Now we figured, pirates,

18:45.721 --> 18:48.079
locals from the islands
desperate for food, medicine.

18:48.104 --> 18:50.110
Now we've had those before, but these guys,

18:50.135 --> 18:52.032
these guys came out shooting.

18:52.057 --> 18:54.204
They think we have the cure.

18:56.589 --> 18:58.377
They were going after the wrong ship.

18:58.401 --> 19:00.684
That was you?

19:00.709 --> 19:02.509
The folks Secnav was talking about?

19:02.534 --> 19:03.572
That was us.

19:03.596 --> 19:06.548
I'm Chief Mate Gonzalez.

19:06.573 --> 19:08.156
They killed our Ship's Master.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.415
We held down as long as we could.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.856
I'm so sorry.

19:11.881 --> 19:15.032
No, sir. I'm sorry.

19:15.057 --> 19:17.579
C.I.C., bridge,

19:17.611 --> 19:19.095
hostiles operating aboard <i> Solace.</i>

19:19.120 --> 19:22.122
I need a 360 surface search.
They didn't come from nowhere.

19:22.147 --> 19:23.780
Find me a ship.

19:23.805 --> 19:25.244
Get us in there closer.
Prepare the weapons.

19:25.269 --> 19:27.600
Aye, sir. Helmsmen, left 15 degrees rudder,

19:27.625 --> 19:29.124
all engines ahead two-thirds.

19:29.727 --> 19:32.891
Everybody, listen. Let's stay together.

19:32.916 --> 19:35.444
- We're getting out of here, all right?
- Doctor, we gotta move you.

19:35.469 --> 19:36.718
I'm... I'm not going anywhere,

19:36.743 --> 19:38.452
this man's chest is filling with blood.

19:38.477 --> 19:40.233
We can't move until I get a tube in him.

19:40.258 --> 19:41.958
Just... give us a minute.

19:41.983 --> 19:43.749
Scalpel 36 French.

19:43.774 --> 19:45.804
Nurse, stat!

19:45.828 --> 19:47.756
Where's this lab you built for the cure?

19:47.781 --> 19:50.699
It's down a level back
aft in a converted I.C.U.,

19:50.724 --> 19:52.305
but the pirates went there first.

19:52.330 --> 19:54.734
Burk, secure the lab,
level three back aft I.C.U.

19:54.759 --> 19:56.406
I say again, secure the lab.

19:56.431 --> 19:59.065
Roger that. Let's move.

19:59.715 --> 20:02.305
- And where are these pirates now?
- I have no idea.

20:02.330 --> 20:04.914
But we heard some shooting,
like, 10 minutes ago,

20:04.939 --> 20:06.271
up by comms.

20:06.595 --> 20:09.328
Wolf, Miller, let's probe our way aft.

20:09.353 --> 20:12.354
When we exit, break right.
Take starboard, we'll go port.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.329
- Flush out contacts.
- Aye, sir.

20:14.354 --> 20:17.477
Cruz, get everyone in here
secured, then join the fight.

20:17.502 --> 20:19.125
- Aye, sir.
- Officer Gonzalez.

20:19.150 --> 20:21.162
Sir. Look like you did prior service

20:21.187 --> 20:22.625
before becoming a merchant mariner.

20:22.650 --> 20:24.365
20 years. Surface warfare.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.807
Firing on an unarmed
hospital ship's a war crime.

20:27.007 --> 20:29.166
You know this ship better than anyone.

20:29.337 --> 20:31.375
- Let's make 'em pay.
- Aye, sir.

20:33.278 --> 20:35.372
Anything on surface search?

20:35.397 --> 20:37.979
No, ma'am. Nothin'.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.255
Let's check underwater.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.200
- Mason.
- Ma'am?

20:42.225 --> 20:44.434
I need you to run sonar.

20:45.452 --> 20:46.651
You passed the murder board.

20:46.676 --> 20:48.393
I need a 360 degree sonar search.

20:48.418 --> 20:51.263
- You can do this.
- Aye, ma'am.

20:51.288 --> 20:53.423
I'm going to man the starboard Mark 38.

20:57.174 --> 21:00.586
Fastest way to comms is through here.

21:02.172 --> 21:03.841
Hey! Freeze!

21:03.866 --> 21:07.167
Hold it right there. U.S.
Navy! Toss out your weapon!

21:14.168 --> 21:17.114
Jesus. Did you see that gun?

21:17.139 --> 21:19.153
These are not pirates.

21:34.287 --> 21:35.787
You ever been shot before, Miller?

21:35.812 --> 21:37.028
Can't say I have.

21:37.155 --> 21:39.772
My advice? Avoid it.

21:40.941 --> 21:43.391
On my six.

21:43.471 --> 21:45.304
Now.

22:10.467 --> 22:12.347
Uhh!

22:17.127 --> 22:18.960
Miller.

22:20.393 --> 22:22.843
Miller.

22:25.224 --> 22:28.353
- Vitals holding. He's stable.
- Not a minute too soon.

22:28.378 --> 22:30.829
Hm2 dulac. Secure the
occlusive dressing on the chest.

22:30.947 --> 22:32.481
Everyone, back behind the equipment

22:32.506 --> 22:33.348
and turn out the lights.

22:33.373 --> 22:35.067
Don't open this door for anyone but Navy.

22:35.091 --> 22:36.089
Understood.

22:36.115 --> 22:37.449
I'll be back.

22:46.983 --> 22:49.767
This is it. This is the lab.

22:49.792 --> 22:51.759
We got company. I can't tell how many.

23:05.422 --> 23:06.755
I got eyes on three.

23:06.780 --> 23:08.747
Fine. Make sure they're clean head shots.

23:08.772 --> 23:09.880
We wanna preserve the lab.

23:09.904 --> 23:10.988
On my count.

23:11.014 --> 23:12.960
Copy that. Ravit?

23:13.288 --> 23:15.063
Ravit?

23:16.015 --> 23:18.629
Hey, hey. What are you doing here?

23:18.654 --> 23:21.543
Looking for the cure? I'll give it to you.

23:25.354 --> 23:27.187
Good shoot.

23:33.831 --> 23:35.197
Nice move.

23:35.222 --> 23:38.033
Yeah, but we're too late.

23:38.058 --> 23:39.182
Damn.

23:39.207 --> 23:40.740
Vulture leader, Burk.

23:40.976 --> 23:43.440
They destroyed the lab
looking for the cure.

23:43.580 --> 23:46.081
I say again, the lab is destroyed.

23:46.263 --> 23:49.541
Not sure what we can salvage. Sorry, sir.

23:49.566 --> 23:51.088
Well, get out of there.

23:51.113 --> 23:52.619
But be advised hostiles are

23:52.644 --> 23:54.385
heavily armed and well-trained.

23:54.410 --> 23:55.725
Roger that.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.469
Come on, Ned.

23:58.494 --> 24:00.190
The bloody U.S. Navy's all about the ship.

24:00.215 --> 24:03.131
We got what we came for.
Let's get out of here.

24:07.327 --> 24:10.726
Gracias. And miss all the fun?

24:12.005 --> 24:17.265
Ding-dong! Hey, U.S.
Navy, it's bad luck for you

24:17.290 --> 24:18.374
happening on this ship,

24:18.400 --> 24:20.328
but this is the end of the line for you.

24:20.581 --> 24:23.115
Because we know how to
fight better than you do.

24:23.140 --> 24:24.789
And if it's a fight you want,

24:24.814 --> 24:26.978
it's a fight you're gonna get.

24:58.435 --> 25:00.124
Whoa! Hold your fire.

25:00.149 --> 25:02.199
Sir, doctors are secure.

25:02.224 --> 25:04.302
About a dozen more M.S.C.S
holed up in the engine room.

25:04.327 --> 25:05.138
Your boys took out

25:05.170 --> 25:07.200
three hostiles with
ropes and wrenches. Nice.

25:07.225 --> 25:09.261
All right, well, we can't
fit everybody on that R.H.I.B.

25:09.286 --> 25:10.614
And there's no clear way down.

25:10.639 --> 25:13.255
We can everyone out on the tender boats.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.669
O2 level, starboard side.

25:14.694 --> 25:18.021
Okay. On my order, get 'em there.

25:18.045 --> 25:20.095
Captain, thank you.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.677
Don't thank me yet.

25:21.702 --> 25:23.221
First, we clear a path,

25:23.616 --> 25:26.294
and then I'm going after
the man behind that voice.

25:26.319 --> 25:27.599
Come on, keep up.

25:27.624 --> 25:29.857
No word from Giovanni or
the others. We're losin' men.

25:29.881 --> 25:31.981
We should give the order and jump ship.

25:32.006 --> 25:34.106
Not until we kill every last one of them.

25:34.131 --> 25:36.520
That wasn't the plan, Ned.
Your brother said we sh...

25:36.545 --> 25:38.890
Don't you every bring up my brother to me!

25:39.009 --> 25:41.009
I know what he wants!

25:41.034 --> 25:44.235
I am the only one that
knows what my brother wants.

25:44.260 --> 25:47.291
So let's just do what needs doing, yeah?

25:47.316 --> 25:49.650
And then we can go.

25:51.034 --> 25:54.953
You're lucky I won't tell Sean
how you cocked up the job today.

26:00.299 --> 26:02.739
We got gunfire. Topside.

26:02.764 --> 26:04.317
- Foster?
- No target.

26:04.342 --> 26:06.926
Sir, if we get any
closer, we could collide.

26:06.951 --> 26:08.856
Chance we have to take. Bring us in closer.

26:08.881 --> 26:10.597
- Find me something to shoot!
- Aye, sir.

26:18.275 --> 26:19.975
Uhh!

26:22.246 --> 26:24.830
- Nice shooting, Miller.
- Thanks, Wolfman.

26:24.855 --> 26:28.023
Hey, wolfman. I like it.

26:34.044 --> 26:36.411
Ambush.

26:37.958 --> 26:40.075
They don't ambush us.

26:40.100 --> 26:42.817
We ambush them.

26:42.842 --> 26:45.179
<i>Nathan James,</i> what's your whiskey?

26:45.204 --> 26:48.163
Comin' up your starboard side,
400 yards, lookin' for a target.

26:48.188 --> 26:50.765
Well, I'll give you one. Flight deck.

26:50.790 --> 26:53.413
We flush three hostiles
topside, you light 'em up.

26:53.438 --> 26:55.238
Roger that. Batteries released.

26:55.263 --> 26:56.155
Aye, sir.

26:59.724 --> 27:02.399
Starboard Mark 38 hot.

27:15.620 --> 27:17.620
On your count.

27:18.787 --> 27:19.506
Three...

27:20.124 --> 27:21.874
Two...

27:22.412 --> 27:24.559
One!

27:34.384 --> 27:36.718
Lost 'em in smoke.

27:45.641 --> 27:48.351
- You got one.
- Roger that.

27:48.376 --> 27:50.771
- These guys are good.
- Too good.

27:50.796 --> 27:53.279
Look for a military ship, a helo.

27:53.304 --> 27:54.887
There could be more where they came from.

27:54.912 --> 27:56.115
Looking.

27:56.140 --> 27:59.059
Sonar, bridge, anything
on that subsurface search?

27:59.084 --> 28:00.559
Nothing in the water, sir.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.600
There could be a ship
hiding out in the deep blue.

28:03.687 --> 28:06.273
Vulture Team, Vulture
team, no R.H.I.B.s, no helo.

28:06.298 --> 28:09.116
These guys didn't just swim here.

28:10.633 --> 28:12.554
How's the patient, doc? He's still stable.

28:12.579 --> 28:13.484
Glad to hear.

28:13.509 --> 28:16.382
Okay, we found the others.
A dozen more survivors.

28:16.407 --> 28:17.725
Oh, thank God.

28:17.750 --> 28:20.546
Okay, everyone, we are
getting you all off the ship.

28:20.571 --> 28:22.234
Let's go. This way. Let's
get the hell out of here.

28:22.259 --> 28:24.304
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- I'm gonna jump on the stretcher.

28:39.368 --> 28:41.613
Vest.

28:50.216 --> 28:51.715
Guys?

28:53.919 --> 28:55.502
They're gonna blow the ship.

28:56.020 --> 28:58.225
Vulture Team,

28:58.250 --> 29:00.905
hostiles have rigged the ship to blow up.

29:00.929 --> 29:03.212
I say again, hostiles have explosives.

29:03.237 --> 29:04.498
All hands, all hands,

29:04.523 --> 29:06.529
abandon ship towards
the Lee, starboard side.

29:06.554 --> 29:08.482
- Get to those tender boats.
- We need to get out of here.

29:08.507 --> 29:09.834
- No.
- No?

29:09.859 --> 29:11.912
We lost the lab. We're gonna lose the ship.

29:11.937 --> 29:16.656
Okay... does anybody know how
to diffuse a bomb like this?

29:27.778 --> 29:33.250
<i>Nathan James,</i> we got
about 18 doctors and crew,

29:33.275 --> 29:34.250
one of them hurt.

29:34.275 --> 29:35.774
We're about to load them into the tenders.

29:35.799 --> 29:37.527
- Did he say doctors?
- Mm-hmm.

29:37.552 --> 29:39.664
We're gonna need cover,
though, starboard amidships.

29:39.689 --> 29:41.101
Roger that.

29:44.309 --> 29:45.891
I've got something on sonar.

29:45.916 --> 29:47.650
Possible submarine in the bounce.

29:47.675 --> 29:49.196
Are you sure?

29:49.220 --> 29:51.336
I...

29:51.361 --> 29:53.878
It's gone.

29:54.837 --> 29:58.231
Bridge, Tao, possible subsurface contact,

29:58.256 --> 30:00.859
bearing 0-5-0 relative.

30:00.884 --> 30:04.135
Request bearing, clear or foul.

30:09.271 --> 30:11.571
How you looking, lieutenant?

30:11.596 --> 30:13.121
Don't talk.

30:13.205 --> 30:16.514
Let's go, let's go, move
it. Let's go. Right in here.

30:35.272 --> 30:36.192
Move it.

30:36.217 --> 30:38.419
- Everyone accounted for?
- Yes, sir.

30:38.443 --> 30:41.560
All right, guys, come on, steady.

30:46.677 --> 30:48.762
Let's go, let's go, move it! Load 'em in.

30:50.040 --> 30:52.906
Come on. Get on that boat!

31:14.436 --> 31:15.885
Uh-oh.

31:15.910 --> 31:18.363
I hope that's Hebrew for "a-okay."

31:25.040 --> 31:28.264
Now that is an oxygen tank we can't move.

31:28.289 --> 31:30.063
Let's go, let's go!

31:31.732 --> 31:33.109
Get 'em into the rear!

31:33.134 --> 31:34.828
Down! Get down!

31:41.713 --> 31:44.469
Get 'em back to the <i>
James!</i> Do not wait for me!

31:44.494 --> 31:47.360
- Let's go. Move. Move it!
- Let's go!

31:47.384 --> 31:49.583
Come on, get up. Go, go, go, go!

31:49.608 --> 31:51.108
Taylor, you all right?

31:51.133 --> 31:52.844
Yeah, through and through.

31:54.427 --> 31:58.640
Oh, this bullet hit the
carotid. I'm with you. All right.

31:58.804 --> 32:01.710
There's a remote
detonator. Contact trigger.

32:01.928 --> 32:03.762
If I pull it, it will go off.

32:04.092 --> 32:05.541
Well, how do you stop it?

32:06.811 --> 32:08.778
- Ravit?
- I'm thinking.

32:08.803 --> 32:13.438
I need to keep contact on the metal.

32:13.901 --> 32:16.485
Captain, we got a little
hitch in our plan here.

32:16.510 --> 32:17.906
We've taken care of the first bomb.

32:17.931 --> 32:19.906
There's another one
with a remote detonator.

32:19.931 --> 32:22.469
And oh, boy, it's a big one. I
don't think we can diffuse it.

32:22.494 --> 32:23.985
Get your asses off the ship.

32:24.158 --> 32:25.469
Doc, let's go!

32:25.494 --> 32:27.527
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

32:27.556 --> 32:31.430
I'm with you. I'm with you. It's okay.

32:36.983 --> 32:39.567
Doc, I'm sorry. We gotta
get you on the boat.

32:41.033 --> 32:43.616
Get out of here!

33:08.062 --> 33:10.262
Come on. We gotta go.

33:10.287 --> 33:12.529
That's everybody. We gotta go.

33:12.554 --> 33:13.672
Well, lower the boat.

33:18.768 --> 33:20.935
You got two on top.

33:42.552 --> 33:43.968
Good shot, ma1.

33:44.087 --> 33:46.794
I'm blocked off. Where are you, mate?

33:46.819 --> 33:48.200
Juan Carlos?

33:48.449 --> 33:51.865
_

33:51.890 --> 33:53.232
get off the ship, man!

33:53.257 --> 33:56.044
Whatever you do, don't let 'em catch you.

33:56.069 --> 33:57.777
_

33:57.802 --> 33:59.427
_

34:04.589 --> 34:07.357
- you got it?
- You guys need to get out of here.

34:07.382 --> 34:08.333
No, we're not leaving...

34:08.358 --> 34:09.728
No, you don't understand.

34:09.753 --> 34:12.513
The detonator is inside. It
needs to be metal to metal.

34:12.538 --> 34:15.224
It... the pressure release, I can't do it!

34:15.248 --> 34:17.498
Aw, hell. Step away.

34:17.524 --> 34:19.466
- What the hell are you doin'?
- I got an idea.

34:19.491 --> 34:22.505
It has to stay in contact
with the metal, right?

34:22.530 --> 34:25.186
- Go on, skedaddle.
- No.

34:25.217 --> 34:26.885
What does that mean?

34:33.016 --> 34:35.013
Tex, are... you know what you're doing?

34:36.054 --> 34:38.005
Make a hole.

34:39.302 --> 34:41.856
End of the road.

34:43.634 --> 34:46.601
You'd like to shoot me.
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

34:46.627 --> 34:49.578
Just a word of warning...
I let go of this button,

34:49.580 --> 34:51.996
and this whole ship gets
blown to kingdom come,

34:51.998 --> 34:53.632
including you

34:53.634 --> 34:56.385
and all the little people
that you're trying to help.

34:59.503 --> 35:00.886
You may blow up this ship,

35:00.911 --> 35:03.111
but I promise I will take you with me.

35:03.253 --> 35:05.053
Well...

35:15.379 --> 35:18.753
Shit. Shit.

35:27.558 --> 35:30.059
Aah! Aah!

35:54.325 --> 35:55.635
Captain's in combat.

35:56.004 --> 35:59.172
Sir, no air or surface contacts on radar.

35:59.197 --> 36:01.802
Negative E.S. in the area.

36:02.867 --> 36:04.898
We spotted at least eight hostiles

36:04.923 --> 36:05.940
diving into the water.

36:05.965 --> 36:07.473
Aside from the one we clipped

36:07.498 --> 36:08.931
who's sitting in our medical bay,

36:08.957 --> 36:10.339
the others never came up for air.

36:10.341 --> 36:11.639
There were no other boats
around <i> Solace,</i>

36:11.664 --> 36:12.827
no R.H.I.B.s, no rafts.

36:12.851 --> 36:15.193
Ah, Cruz said he found some
wet suits with the hostages.

36:15.907 --> 36:19.075
My guess is they came
in on 2-man subs, S.D.V.

36:19.100 --> 36:21.067
Agreed. They're military.

36:21.069 --> 36:22.768
Any indication whose flag they're flying?

36:22.747 --> 36:24.846
They weren't nice enough to wear uniforms.

36:24.871 --> 36:26.646
Mercenaries, then.

36:26.671 --> 36:28.446
Hunting the cure for the higher bidder.

36:28.471 --> 36:30.304
Hospital ship was a natural target.

36:30.329 --> 36:34.048
Mason, are you sure
you saw a sub out there?

36:36.925 --> 36:38.225
Sir, I'm sure of it.

36:38.257 --> 36:40.457
Hidden out there in the seabed...

36:40.482 --> 36:42.092
It was a sub.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.475
Well, keep searching the water.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.397
The minute you find anything, I wanna know.

36:45.422 --> 36:47.428
- Aye-aye, sir.
- Yes, sir.

36:49.901 --> 36:52.351
Welcome aboard.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.043
Thank you.

37:01.254 --> 37:03.371
Good as gold. Thanks.

37:03.396 --> 37:05.446
Hey, Wolfman.

37:07.182 --> 37:08.836
I'll never play the fiddle again.

37:08.861 --> 37:09.879
Never say never.

37:09.904 --> 37:12.488
You'll regret that.

37:13.214 --> 37:15.381
Doctor Milowsky,

37:15.406 --> 37:18.240
I'm so sorry that you all got
caught in the middle of this.

37:18.265 --> 37:21.538
We left behind family, friends,

37:21.563 --> 37:23.513
all of us working in isolation.

37:23.581 --> 37:25.851
<i>Solace</i> was our last hope.

37:26.556 --> 37:31.062
You have the cure, and
they destroyed my lab.

37:31.128 --> 37:33.162
It's a great loss for us all.

37:35.066 --> 37:36.899
Chief Mate Gonzalez saved our lives.

37:36.924 --> 37:39.758
I just wish I could've saved his.

37:39.847 --> 37:43.209
So what happens to us now?

37:43.299 --> 37:44.932
Well, your ship is seaworthy,

37:45.026 --> 37:47.171
you have enough crew to
get you and your associates

37:47.196 --> 37:48.818
back to Norfolk. We have people there.

37:48.843 --> 37:50.857
You'll be needed and greatly appreciated.

37:50.882 --> 37:53.654
We'll send you back with
doses of the cure, obviously.

37:53.679 --> 37:55.896
I wanna stay here with you all.

37:58.103 --> 38:00.021
I'm an expert in vaccine manufacturing

38:00.046 --> 38:01.712
and genetic engineering.

38:01.911 --> 38:04.378
If you're spreading the cure,
I'd like to be a part of it.

38:04.543 --> 38:07.494
I'm sure we could use the help.

38:10.291 --> 38:13.040
It would be an honor to have you.

38:19.063 --> 38:21.306
Hey.

38:22.930 --> 38:24.346
You okay?

38:24.371 --> 38:27.038
Yeah, it'd take, uh, more
than a bullet to knock me out.

38:27.111 --> 38:30.691
I'm just glad we all got back
in one piece, more or less.

38:30.716 --> 38:34.877
You, uh... did real good out there today.

38:34.902 --> 38:38.633
I'm glad to have you on the team.

38:40.574 --> 38:42.207
What?

38:43.254 --> 38:44.652
I like you guys.

38:45.860 --> 38:48.251
You're crazy.

38:58.611 --> 39:00.494
It's a miracle he survived.

39:00.761 --> 39:03.610
The lord works in mysterious ways, Deacon.

39:03.635 --> 39:06.019
No doubt about that.

39:06.233 --> 39:07.599
While he was conscious,

39:07.624 --> 39:09.391
he was muttering what sounded like Spanish,

39:09.437 --> 39:12.271
but you said your guy had a British accent.

39:13.801 --> 39:16.552
An international band of thieves.

39:16.577 --> 39:18.774
How'd they get their hands on a sub?

39:18.799 --> 39:23.102
Well, if this man ever
wakes up, we'll find out.

39:43.103 --> 39:47.421
So, you guys, is someone
gonna explain to me

39:47.446 --> 39:50.206
where we're going in the
middle of the night here?

39:50.231 --> 39:52.813
I told ya. There's someone
who wants to meet ya.

39:53.257 --> 39:56.708
Was there a problem?
You didn't find the ship?

39:56.734 --> 39:58.774
Oh, yeah, we found it.

39:58.799 --> 40:03.574
So great news. You see? I
told you. Right? I was right?

40:03.599 --> 40:06.031
Standard protocol for
emergency preparedness,

40:06.056 --> 40:08.651
all hospital ships go offshore.

40:08.676 --> 40:11.343
Niels, he said they found it.

40:11.585 --> 40:13.785
He didn't say nothin' about good news.

40:13.810 --> 40:16.016
What was the problem? You
didn't find what I told you?

40:16.041 --> 40:18.041
No, we found the United States Navy...

40:18.066 --> 40:19.432
A ship.

40:19.457 --> 40:20.956
You found the Navy?

40:20.981 --> 40:23.315
Yeah, it's like they knew we were comin'.

40:25.081 --> 40:28.522
You guys, that's them. That's them.

40:28.547 --> 40:30.679
That's captain Chandler and Rachel...

40:30.704 --> 40:33.565
That, um, Dr. Scott. I
mean, they have the cure.

40:33.590 --> 40:35.340
Did you catch them?

40:39.893 --> 40:42.903
You think I had something to do with that?

40:42.929 --> 40:46.147
You guys, I assure you, the
last time I saw that ship,

40:46.172 --> 40:49.540
we were, like, a few miles
from Jamaica. I swear.

40:49.565 --> 40:52.449
If you suspect that I somehow set you up...

40:52.474 --> 40:57.527
I categorically deny any
involvement in any kind of...

40:57.552 --> 41:01.190
Do us a favor, Niels. Stop talkin'.

41:01.215 --> 41:03.382
You can save your bellyaching for the boss.

41:05.741 --> 41:07.240
The boss?

41:08.595 --> 41:09.978
Let's go.

41:24.504 --> 41:26.471
The boss.
