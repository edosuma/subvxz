00:07.882 --> 00:10.113
All right,
here's your motel.

00:11.099 --> 00:12.673
You're gonna love Chicago.

00:12.708 --> 00:17.187
You never lived near the ocean, but that's all
about to change thanks to good old lake Michigan.

00:20.768 --> 00:23.070
Yeah, I just wish
I knew someone here.

00:23.727 --> 00:25.442
A friendly face, you know?

00:25.439 --> 00:27.630
Don't worry. You're
gonna be great.

00:37.740 --> 00:41.345
Oh, boy, I got a
long drive back.

00:44.586 --> 00:48.151
You know, that door's kind of
tricky. You gotta actually open it.

00:54.386 --> 00:57.662
All right, Jackie, do you want me to stay
and get a burger with you or something?

00:58.479 --> 01:02.119
Oh! Michael, it's like
you're a mind reader.

01:02.142 --> 01:05.647
Okay. Wait. Now keep going.
Guess what I want on my burger.

01:05.892 --> 01:10.142
Lettuce, tomato and ketchup put
on by a waiter born in America.

01:17.025 --> 01:19.843
Eric, you're gonna
love teaching in Africa.

01:19.867 --> 01:22.685
I hear the women walk around
with their hoo-hoos hanging out.

01:23.190 --> 01:24.012
Dad!

01:24.749 --> 01:26.240
You get your shots yet?

01:26.276 --> 01:27.379
Wait. What shots?

01:27.403 --> 01:30.256
The vaccines to protect
you against exotic diseases.

01:30.289 --> 01:32.250
I had to get 'em when
I was in the military.

01:32.285 --> 01:34.164
You were in the
national guard.

01:35.597 --> 01:38.779
What exotic diseases were
you afraid you'd catch...

01:39.284 --> 01:42.556
scaredy-cat-eatin'-
pie in-a-jacuzzi fever?

01:44.975 --> 01:47.359
Hey, I'm proud
of my service.

01:47.382 --> 01:50.177
Somebody had to stay home
and hose down those hippies.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.135
You guys, I leave for
Africa in two days.

01:53.159 --> 01:55.143
How come no one told
me about these shots?

01:55.178 --> 01:58.548
Oh, goodness gracious. Did I
forget to give you that letter?

02:00.509 --> 02:04.511
You know, when you get to be my age,
sometimes you forget about things.

02:04.546 --> 02:06.183
And sometimes

02:06.207 --> 02:11.244
you hide them in the rarely used mexican
soup section of this gigantic cookbook.

02:12.297 --> 02:15.079
Mom, I need these shots.

02:15.103 --> 02:17.369
Africa is very strict
about these things,

02:17.404 --> 02:19.412
and they're not
strict about anything.

02:19.541 --> 02:21.995
I mean, the women walk around
with their hoo-hoos hanging out.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.326
Kitty,

02:24.831 --> 02:29.105
you have no right to stand in
the way of someone's dreams.

02:29.187 --> 02:31.946
And if you don't let
Eric go to Africa,

02:32.052 --> 02:35.525
you'll crush my dream
of getting rid of him.

02:36.747 --> 02:37.592
Fine.

02:38.073 --> 02:40.257
Eric, I'll give
you the shots.

02:40.422 --> 02:42.700
A mother should
support her son.

02:43.065 --> 02:47.339
Just know... the needles
are big as sausages,

02:47.926 --> 02:52.787
and if I miss the mark by even a
hair, your heart might explode.

02:53.374 --> 02:56.671
But don't worry. It
only hurts till you die.

03:35.415 --> 03:39.537
Donna, look, there's something really
important I need you to do for me.

03:39.572 --> 03:42.566
Eric, I don't care if you're going
to Africa. I'm not doing that.

03:43.564 --> 03:47.591
Just please don't let my mom plan
this fancy send-off for me, okay?

03:47.626 --> 03:50.949
I can just see her planning this
embarrassing farewell with, like,

03:50.984 --> 03:53.859
music and banners and, like,

03:54.341 --> 03:55.397
doves.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.333
Oh, man, it's
good to be home.

03:58.650 --> 04:02.205
Jackie was all depressed and crying 'cause
she didn't have any friends in Chicago,

04:02.240 --> 04:05.140
so I had to lighten the
mood with some skee-ball.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.073
Um,

04:08.684 --> 04:10.398
Jackie hates skee-ball.

04:10.950 --> 04:12.547
I didn't take Jackie.

04:13.439 --> 04:17.220
Well, that explains why she's called me
four times since she's been in Chicago.

04:17.244 --> 04:19.975
Three of those were to say
that she hates my outfit.

04:21.255 --> 04:22.911
How does she know?

04:24.555 --> 04:25.365
Eric?

04:26.022 --> 04:28.662
Jackie's on the phone.
She wants to talk to you.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.540
Jackie wants to
talk to Forman?

04:30.575 --> 04:34.107
Yes. Now pick up, because she's
been blabbering for 20 minutes.

04:34.130 --> 04:38.170
And I never noticed it when she was living
here, but she's not that interesting.

04:46.419 --> 04:47.253
Hello?

04:47.546 --> 04:49.378
Hey, Eric? It's Jackie.

04:49.836 --> 04:51.010
Uh-huh.

04:53.678 --> 04:58.422
Look, I just realized you're about to leave for Africa,
and I won't get a chance to say good-bye in person.

04:58.445 --> 04:59.972
That makes me sad.

05:00.488 --> 05:02.934
I mean, you've always
been very special to me.

05:07.161 --> 05:10.343
Okay, Jackie, if there's
a gun to your head,

05:11.834 --> 05:14.298
say the word cream cheese.

05:15.858 --> 05:18.805
No, Eric, I'm just gonna
miss you is all, okay?

05:19.157 --> 05:21.513
So just take care of
yourself in Africa.

05:21.640 --> 05:23.542
Okay. I will.

05:24.341 --> 05:25.914
Wait, you want
to talk to who?

05:27.781 --> 05:30.104
You want to tell
him you love him?

05:31.266 --> 05:35.188
Well, I don't know. You guys didn't
really leave on the best of terms.

05:36.421 --> 05:37.266
Okay.

05:38.917 --> 05:40.737
Dad, telephone!

05:45.829 --> 05:48.951
I don't know Eric very well, but
he seems like a heck of a nice guy.

05:48.987 --> 05:51.523
Eric? Eric is good
people. Is good people, yes.

05:54.752 --> 05:57.664
I'll never forget. It was
the hottest day of summer,

05:57.973 --> 06:01.190
and Hyde and Kelso dug a hole
then covered it with leaves.

06:02.893 --> 06:06.533
And they said, "Hey, Fez, want
to see a pile of dead leaves?"

06:10.387 --> 06:12.747
So naturally, I ran over.

06:14.000 --> 06:14.748
What happened?

06:15.073 --> 06:16.376
I fell in,

06:16.881 --> 06:18.290
and I couldn't get out.

06:18.584 --> 06:20.434
And the sun was
beating down.

06:20.904 --> 06:22.841
So hot. So hot.

06:25.742 --> 06:27.949
Finally, Eric came over.

06:27.994 --> 06:30.495
And you know what that
magnificent boy did?

06:32.467 --> 06:35.004
He poured soda all over me,

06:35.520 --> 06:38.045
because that's
what friends do.

06:39.403 --> 06:40.718
And then the ants came.

06:42.526 --> 06:43.700
Hey, guys.

06:44.581 --> 06:46.107
Oh, Eric.

06:47.361 --> 06:49.134
about you leaving, uh,

06:49.709 --> 06:51.846
I just want you
to know that, uh...

06:53.924 --> 06:56.390
Oh, here comes
the waterworks!

07:01.522 --> 07:03.682
- Hey, Hyde, man.
- Hey, man.

07:04.516 --> 07:08.297
Listen, I want some tunes, so
I need to find a record store.

07:15.888 --> 07:17.778
Leo, you're in
a record store.

07:18.283 --> 07:20.385
Whoa, that was fast, man!

07:22.619 --> 07:24.293
So what are you doing here?

07:24.342 --> 07:25.763
I'm the boss, man,

07:25.801 --> 07:28.643
which is ironic, 'cause I'm also
the least-motivated employee.

07:29.676 --> 07:34.282
So if you have a whole record store, how
come you've been kind of mopey lately, man?

07:35.068 --> 07:36.513
I'm not mopey. I'm fine.

07:36.853 --> 07:39.976
Well, where's that loud girl
you're always hangin' with?

07:42.219 --> 07:43.945
Jackie? She's in Chicago.

07:44.555 --> 07:47.068
Loud girl's in Chicago!

07:47.655 --> 07:50.085
Hey, that's why
you're sad, man.

07:50.109 --> 07:52.023
You love loud girl.

07:53.061 --> 07:54.199
Maybe I do.

07:54.376 --> 07:56.900
You know what? The only
reason I'm admitting that

07:56.935 --> 08:00.587
is because you have no short-term memory. You're
gonna forget this conversation when it's over.

08:01.620 --> 08:04.166
Hey, that's not true, man.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.432
Hey, guess what I found out.

08:06.455 --> 08:07.406
What, Leo?

08:07.665 --> 08:09.858
Loud girl's in Chicago.

08:15.402 --> 08:18.642
Oh, crap. It's almost time
for me to go get my shots.

08:18.842 --> 08:21.120
Yeah, why do I have
to get shots anyway?

08:21.272 --> 08:23.257
So I get yellow fever.

08:24.595 --> 08:26.265
I could use a little color.

08:27.463 --> 08:30.692
You guys, this might be our last 
circle together. We're growing up.

08:31.526 --> 08:35.265
I mean, these two have
jobs, and Eric is off to start his life, and

08:35.994 --> 08:38.037
I'm doing more
shaving than ever.

08:38.881 --> 08:43.296
Eric, I know you're scared of getting
your shots. So I'm gonna be a pal

08:43.332 --> 08:47.741
and get 'em with you, 'cause I owe you for that
time that I chucked that dead raccoon at you,

08:47.765 --> 08:52.567
and then it turned out to not be dead. And
then it bit you, and you kicked it back at me,

08:52.591 --> 08:56.501
and then it bit me, and then we
both had to go and get rabies shots.

08:58.008 --> 08:59.804
Remember on the
way to the hospital,

08:59.827 --> 09:02.786
Kelso saw that dog, and he jumped out
of the car' cause he wanted to go pet it,

09:02.810 --> 09:05.276
but he forgot the car was
moving, and he broke his arm?

09:05.651 --> 09:09.844
That was the funniest, bloodiest,
most rabies-filled day ever.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.026
Look at us.

09:13.531 --> 09:16.372
Best friends offering
to help each other.

09:17.453 --> 09:20.394
You know, we always have
to remember this moment.

09:33.055 --> 09:34.175
What?

09:34.796 --> 09:37.250
Upstairs! Now!

09:40.701 --> 09:42.908
I am in huge

09:43.038 --> 09:44.153
trouble.

09:53.774 --> 10:00.349
I can't believe that is what you idiots have
been doing in my basement all these years!

10:02.145 --> 10:06.006
I wish I had 2,000 feet

10:06.604 --> 10:11.184
so I could put 500 of them
in each of your asses!

10:13.550 --> 10:14.983
I'm shocked.

10:15.523 --> 10:19.116
The basement door closes and out
come the lighters and the drugs.

10:19.139 --> 10:23.739
And I am sure Donna's down there
bouncing around without a bra.

10:23.821 --> 10:26.827
It's like Amsterdam
down there.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.442
Did someone shove a
vacuum up your nose

10:31.477 --> 10:34.990
and suck out your last
lonely brain cell?

10:37.914 --> 10:40.661
What is going
on in your head?

10:44.994 --> 10:49.771
I am so disappointed
in you boys.

10:49.994 --> 10:53.681
And here I thought it was my dryer
that made our clothes smell funny.

10:54.733 --> 10:56.753
who taught you
how to do this?

10:57.410 --> 11:00.181
Was it those damn beatles?

11:00.780 --> 11:03.058
"All you need is love."

11:03.258 --> 11:06.273
All you need is a
job and a haircut!

11:07.036 --> 11:08.058
And you...

11:08.410 --> 11:13.694
wipe that stupid smirk off
your dopey, dope-fiend face!

11:15.180 --> 11:16.578
Do you know what
drugs do to you?

11:17.681 --> 11:22.824
They shrink your brain until one day you wake
up, and you think you're superman and you can fly,

11:22.848 --> 11:26.916
and then you wind up jumping
off the roof in your underpants.

11:30.309 --> 11:32.834
Oh, this idiot doesn't
need drugs for that.

11:32.869 --> 11:34.783
He does that every saturday.

11:38.838 --> 11:42.384
Well, this is the worst thing
that you have ever done!

11:42.699 --> 11:45.129
Eric, I am gonna make you...

11:47.325 --> 11:48.699
I am going to...

11:50.566 --> 11:53.622
Well, I can't think of anything
worse than sending you to Africa.

11:54.373 --> 11:55.782
You're going to Africa!

11:59.643 --> 12:00.641
Hey, Leo.

12:02.566 --> 12:03.423
So

12:03.752 --> 12:07.192
I decided that tomorrow after I say
good-bye to Forman, I'm gonna go to Chicago.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.576
Hey, loud girl's in Chicago.

12:10.503 --> 12:12.030
You should look her up.

12:13.217 --> 12:14.309
Good idea.

12:15.131 --> 12:18.501
Anyway, what I was thinking is, while
I'm gone, you could run the record store.

12:18.548 --> 12:20.743
It'd be fun, man, like the
old days at the fotohut.

12:25.223 --> 12:27.571
You know, the film
place you used to own?

12:27.665 --> 12:31.728
Wait. Was it a little blue
house in the middle of a parking lin..

12:31.752 --> 12:33.820
with a drive-up window?

12:35.323 --> 12:36.215
Exactly.

12:37.460 --> 12:39.503
I don't remember
that at all, man.

12:41.851 --> 12:42.726
Okay,

12:43.336 --> 12:47.105
Michael, Eric, pull your pants
down and lean over the table.

12:47.939 --> 12:50.628
I'll go get those
gigantic needles.

12:51.929 --> 12:55.158
I just hope somebody remembered
to bring them in out of the rain

12:55.181 --> 12:57.083
so they're not all rusty.

12:59.972 --> 13:03.712
Hey, Donna, I'm gonna need you
to help me pull my pants off.

13:03.888 --> 13:05.637
Fine. Turn around.

13:10.982 --> 13:12.121
Wedgie!

13:14.117 --> 13:16.453
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you say off?

13:16.489 --> 13:18.590
I thought you
said up your butt.

13:20.516 --> 13:22.207
I still liked it.

13:37.771 --> 13:39.743
I can't believe you're
leaving tomorrow.

13:40.870 --> 13:41.751
Yeah.

13:43.559 --> 13:47.568
And it's kind of weird spending
our last moments together

13:48.789 --> 13:51.207
bent over a table with
our naked butts in the air.

13:56.031 --> 13:58.004
This is how I
always hoped it'd be.

14:03.053 --> 14:03.851
You know,

14:04.779 --> 14:07.122
I was gonna say that
I'll miss you, but

14:07.862 --> 14:09.776
I'm not a nancy-boy.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.635
And, Kelso, there's something
I want to say to you...

14:15.994 --> 14:17.556
son of a bitch!

14:18.801 --> 14:21.372
Oh, that hurt like hell!

14:24.531 --> 14:26.891
That was the alcohol swab.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.777
Well, it was freezing.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.071
Well, this is it.

14:39.388 --> 14:43.051
Just have to make it past
mom's farewell ambush, and then

14:43.439 --> 14:44.954
off to Africa.

14:45.118 --> 14:48.288
Actually, Eric, I wanted
to talk to you first.

14:48.887 --> 14:50.766
I don't know if
you know this, but

14:51.353 --> 14:55.122
I've been looking forward to you
getting out of the house for a long time.

14:57.036 --> 14:59.559
Yeah. I believe your
exact words were,

14:59.606 --> 15:02.002
"it will be more
glorious than d-day."

15:03.035 --> 15:04.737
Yeah. Well,

15:06.075 --> 15:07.544
you're my son, and

15:08.130 --> 15:09.797
I'm your father, so...

15:12.263 --> 15:13.202
here.

15:15.203 --> 15:17.246
That's your pocket
knife from Korea.

15:18.279 --> 15:23.453
You said if I ever touched that, I'd meet the
same fate as hundreds of other godless commies.

15:25.472 --> 15:26.459
Well,

15:27.797 --> 15:30.192
I want you to take
it to Africa.

15:32.059 --> 15:32.936
Really?

15:35.894 --> 15:38.125
Wow, dad, that means a lot.

15:38.983 --> 15:41.084
And, son, I want
you to know that

15:41.530 --> 15:44.547
I'm gonna miss you, and I
love you, and have a good trip.

15:46.203 --> 15:48.152
Wait a second. What
did you just say?

15:49.829 --> 15:51.332
I said have a good trip.

15:52.353 --> 15:54.619
No, before that.

15:55.935 --> 15:57.038
You heard me.

16:01.882 --> 16:04.571
Wow, this feels like one
of those moments when,

16:05.968 --> 16:08.117
you know, normal
people would hug.

16:14.764 --> 16:15.903
Thank you, dad.

16:20.308 --> 16:22.626
So really, any
last-minute advice?

16:22.669 --> 16:23.913
Uh, yeah.

16:26.355 --> 16:28.622
You lose that knife,
don't come home.

16:40.552 --> 16:41.644
Surprise.

16:42.816 --> 16:44.061
It's just you?

16:45.317 --> 16:49.816
Donna, this is the
best surprise ever.

16:51.906 --> 16:53.644
So Vista Cruiser, huh?

16:55.370 --> 16:57.413
This is where we
had our first kiss.

16:57.460 --> 16:58.963
I know. I remember.

17:09.989 --> 17:10.810
Wow.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.569
Well, it's gotta last
a really long time.

17:17.722 --> 17:19.131
This is weird.

17:20.353 --> 17:22.042
I mean, me leaving.

17:24.473 --> 17:25.917
It's like it's real.

17:25.964 --> 17:30.584
Yeah, but you're gonna be back before you know it, and
then we're gonna have our whole lives to spend together.

17:31.065 --> 17:32.697
Listen to me, Donna.

17:34.588 --> 17:36.431
I love you so much.

17:37.464 --> 17:39.423
You know, you're
my best friend.

17:39.974 --> 17:40.878
And I...

17:44.730 --> 17:45.763
I love you.

17:48.603 --> 17:52.278
And thank you for not letting my
mom plan this, like, going-away

17:52.302 --> 17:53.934
surprise thing.

17:56.705 --> 17:57.926
I love you, too, Eric.

17:59.269 --> 18:00.596
And I'm sorry.

18:00.924 --> 18:01.816
For what?

18:02.239 --> 18:03.625
For this... okay, guys!

18:03.660 --> 18:04.458
Oh...

18:05.996 --> 18:07.582
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

18:09.379 --> 18:10.377
Mom!

18:11.798 --> 18:13.958
Oh, you know, who am I
kidding? I wanted this.

18:15.508 --> 18:16.929
Oh, Eric!

18:18.630 --> 18:20.215
Okay, Charlie,

18:20.391 --> 18:24.113
I'm gonna put you in charge of
this. If you ever wantto cheer Fez up,

18:24.336 --> 18:25.463
here's a little trick.

18:25.581 --> 18:27.506
I got you! Who got you?

18:27.542 --> 18:29.516
- You do, Eric.
- Okay.

18:33.521 --> 18:34.812
Here you go, Forman.

18:34.963 --> 18:36.384
A little going-away gift.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.016
Oh, thanks, man.

18:41.785 --> 18:43.417
Hyde, this bag is empty.

18:45.104 --> 18:47.558
Yeah. I heard about the stuff
they have over in Africa.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.648
Fill that bad boy up,
send it back to me.

18:58.326 --> 18:59.265
Honey,

19:00.921 --> 19:03.586
I'm sorry if I
smothered you.

19:03.786 --> 19:06.040
That's just what
a mother does.

19:07.244 --> 19:09.932
But I've accepted that
you're leaving, and

19:09.968 --> 19:11.809
I'm ready
to let you go.

19:11.844 --> 19:12.854
Oh, mom.

19:20.990 --> 19:22.786
Mom, you... I'm

19:22.915 --> 19:25.322
really only allowed
one carry-on, so...

19:26.273 --> 19:27.142
Dad?

19:28.610 --> 19:30.453
Come on, Kitty. Come on.

19:31.066 --> 19:36.256
Eric, I'm not real good with words, so I thought
I'd say good-bye the only way I know how.

19:36.291 --> 19:37.606
Hit it, boys.

19:58.768 --> 20:00.952
So long, Point Place!

20:12.940 --> 20:15.371
Oh, for Pete's sake.

20:15.406 --> 20:16.392
Come on.

20:22.124 --> 20:24.167
So long, Point Place!

20:33.494 --> 20:34.516
Come in.

20:38.332 --> 20:39.083
Hey.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.582
Steven! What, um,

20:42.721 --> 20:44.259
what are you doing here?

20:44.835 --> 20:49.167
Uh, nothing. Had some free time,
thought I'd check out Chicago.

20:50.478 --> 20:51.840
How's it goin'?

20:52.193 --> 20:53.660
Um, good.

20:55.468 --> 20:58.181
Hey, do you want to go take a
walk, maybe get something to eat?

20:58.251 --> 21:01.300
Jackie, I checked. No one can see
us doing it from the parking lot!

21:09.895 --> 21:11.011
You're dead.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.818
I'm nude!
