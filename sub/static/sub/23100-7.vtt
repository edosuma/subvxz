01:45.333 --> 01:47.250
-Crick!
-Crick! Crick!

02:01.708 --> 02:02.791
Thank goodness.

02:02.875 --> 02:04.625
We saved you.

02:04.708 --> 02:08.041
Two Crick arms, two Crick legs.

02:08.125 --> 02:12.958
Crick is 100 percent here
and feeling re-in-Crick-torvated!

02:14.291 --> 02:17.458
What does re-in-Crick-torvated feel like?

02:17.541 --> 02:20.500
It's like how you feel
when it's your birthday.

02:20.583 --> 02:22.250
Unless you're really old, that is.

02:22.333 --> 02:25.750
How many birthdays
do you need to get really old?

02:25.833 --> 02:27.208
Uh, how old?

02:27.291 --> 02:30.000
Um... As old as my grandpa.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.750
How old is your grandpa, Buzz?

02:31.833 --> 02:36.958
Well, he used to be purple,
but now he is more of a gray-ish.

02:37.041 --> 02:41.750
Gray.
Well, gray needs a lot of birthdays.

02:42.708 --> 02:46.083
I wonder what it would be like to be old.

02:46.166 --> 02:50.208
Hmm. All my squish
would get, uh, Crickety.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.208
Wow.

03:00.833 --> 03:03.833
-What is this?
-I know what it will be.

03:06.583 --> 03:07.750
What is it?

03:09.208 --> 03:12.333
It's a time travel machine.

03:12.416 --> 03:14.125
What's a time travel machine?

03:14.208 --> 03:15.208
Um...

03:15.291 --> 03:20.541
A machine that can take you to the past
and maybe to the future too.

03:20.625 --> 03:22.791
-Does it work?
-Let's find out.

03:26.916 --> 03:28.666
Awesome.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.041
Hmm. Hmm.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.375
We need to repair it.

03:34.458 --> 03:38.750
It might only take a few alterations
of the specifications.

03:38.833 --> 03:43.291
This is clearly a time machine from
the future or perhaps it's from the past.

03:43.375 --> 03:46.583
-Let's hop inside.
-We need to get it ready steady to go.

03:46.666 --> 03:48.916
Let's get started!

04:03.166 --> 04:08.166
By my calculations,
it's from at least, um... tomorrow

04:08.250 --> 04:10.833
-or perhaps yesterday.
-Let's go in it now!

04:10.916 --> 04:14.666
-It will only work one at a time.
-How excitement!

04:14.750 --> 04:19.916
We need something to conduct energy
from the sun.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.000
Aha!

04:23.458 --> 04:27.333
The spoon. The spoon.
We've got to get the spoon.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.416
Mm-hm.

04:37.041 --> 04:40.833
Heh. This is it. It's ready to go.

04:40.916 --> 04:44.500
-But who is the readiest to go in it?
-I will go first.

04:46.625 --> 04:47.708
Wow.

04:54.875 --> 04:55.916
Whoa.

05:04.916 --> 05:05.958
Huh?

05:24.000 --> 05:28.875
Guys... what is happening? Guys?

05:31.083 --> 05:34.666
Jay! You have to get out!

05:34.750 --> 05:37.541
We can't... move you!

05:57.958 --> 05:59.708
What is happening?

06:16.833 --> 06:17.791
Huh?

06:33.833 --> 06:37.375
Is this what the future looks like?

06:37.458 --> 06:40.125
Am I in the future?

06:40.208 --> 06:44.458
Wow... it worked.

06:44.833 --> 06:47.750
Just how old am I?

06:49.041 --> 06:54.000
Whoa. I am old. I am gray.

Oh, no, our time machine is gone.

11:44.291 --> 11:47.333
But it's okay. I got to go to the future.

11:47.416 --> 11:50.166

11:54.666 --> 11:56.833
I'll tell you one thing.

We will still be the best of friends.

12:00.916 --> 12:02.708
Even when I go gray?

12:02.791 --> 12:04.750
Heh. Even then.

12:49.791 --> 12:52.583
-Dr. Robert?
-Dr. Robert?

12:52.666 --> 12:56.000
Why are we even seeing him again?
I'm not sick.

12:56.083 --> 12:59.000
The best way to make sure you stay healthy
is to see a doctor,

12:59.083 --> 13:01.583
so he can catch anything
that might be coming your way.

13:01.666 --> 13:03.375
-But--
-We get the shots and vitamins

13:03.458 --> 13:05.541
-to keep us crick-riffic.
-Crick-riffic?

13:05.625 --> 13:08.208
Healthy. That's why we have
to come here and see...

13:08.291 --> 13:11.416
- Dr. Robert.
- Beat Bugs.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.666
Dr. Robert.
We're here for our check-ups.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.500

Well, nearly everyone.

13:51.708 --> 13:53.166
Where's Buzz?

13:53.250 --> 13:57.291
Um... She didn't want to come
to the doctors because she's sick.

13:57.375 --> 14:00.166
Heh. I'm no medical expert,

14:00.250 --> 14:04.958
although, I mean, I did once play
a medical expert in a small play that I--

14:05.041 --> 14:06.291
Heh. Walter.

14:06.375 --> 14:12.708
Ahem. But, uh, being sick
seems like a bad reason

14:12.791 --> 14:14.333
not to come to the doctor's.

14:14.416 --> 14:19.125
You have to go and get her.
This could be... an emergency.

14:19.208 --> 14:21.333
An emergency?

14:23.708 --> 14:28.208
You heard the doctor.
He said an emergency.

14:39.166 --> 14:41.333
Buzz, we know you're in there.
Open up.

14:41.416 --> 14:44.791
I am not going. I am not going.

14:44.875 --> 14:47.958
I am not going to see the doctor.

14:49.833 --> 14:53.000
-Buzz? Come on, open the door.
-Come on, Buzz.

14:53.083 --> 14:58.708
We have to get this door open.
He said "emergency."

14:58.791 --> 15:01.125
Uh, let me try this.

15:01.208 --> 15:04.916
Uh... Lefty loosey, a little...

15:05.000 --> 15:07.166
Oh. Uh, uh, uh...

15:07.250 --> 15:10.041
Ooh! If I just try this,
I might be able to--

15:10.125 --> 15:11.833
Come on, come on, come on.

15:11.916 --> 15:16.833
Emergency, you cannot spell
"emergency," without "urgency."

15:16.916 --> 15:17.875
Uh, uh...

15:18.291 --> 15:20.333
Maybe if I, uh...

15:20.416 --> 15:21.375
What the...?

15:21.458 --> 15:22.916
Hmm.

15:23.833 --> 15:26.333
Whee! Huh?

15:28.208 --> 15:32.333
-Uh, what's that?
-It's a find-your-friend-o-meter.

15:36.958 --> 15:41.541
- It's time for you to see Dr. Robert.
- Get off me!

15:41.625 --> 15:43.375
Oh, my goodness gracious.

15:43.458 --> 15:47.333
- Is that you?
- No, it's not me.

15:47.416 --> 15:49.791
Oh, there you are, Buzz.

15:49.875 --> 15:50.708
Catch this, buddy.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.458
Jay!

15:54.541 --> 15:57.625
Sorry, I thought you were gonna...
catch it.

15:57.708 --> 15:58.916
She already caught a cold.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.291
-Her hands were full.
-Someone else can catch the cold.

16:02.375 --> 16:03.875
I don't want it.

16:03.958 --> 16:07.708
Even if someone else catches it,
you'll still have it.

16:07.791 --> 16:11.875
Even if I throw it to them
really, really hard?

16:12.500 --> 16:15.750
You have to go see Dr. Robert.
You're sick.

16:15.833 --> 16:18.000
I am not sick, I am...

16:22.375 --> 16:26.333
Heh. Buzz, the only way you're gonna
to get better is if you see Dr. Robert.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.416
I am not going.

16:31.041 --> 16:32.500
Why don't you want to go?

16:32.583 --> 16:38.708
Because... I'm scared of doctors.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.083
Being scared is okay.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.750
But sometimes you have to do things
that scare you just a little bit...

16:44.833 --> 16:47.791
so you can do more of the things
that make you a lot of happy.

16:47.875 --> 16:53.458
Oh, Buzz, I used to be someone
who was scared-- Aah!

16:55.208 --> 17:00.083
Ahem, sorry, it just keeps creeping up
on me. It just keeps doing it.

17:00.166 --> 17:01.833
It's just your shadow.

17:01.916 --> 17:05.000
Well, I'm sick of it following me around.

17:05.083 --> 17:10.000
It's really bad at the moment...
particularly in the afternoons.

17:12.583 --> 17:15.500
-You have to go to Dr. Robert.
-Why?

17:15.583 --> 17:20.040
So, you're in the bestest of health
for crick-riffic play.

17:20.125 --> 17:22.500
Can't we just play now?

17:25.790 --> 17:29.000
- Yeah!
- Let's go!

17:29.083 --> 17:31.666
Come on.

17:32.250 --> 17:36.041
I guess... just for a little bit.

17:51.666 --> 17:55.250
You can't catch me
if you can't see where I'm hiding.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.875
You can't catch me,

17:56.958 --> 18:00.583
-if you can't see where I am hiding.
-Walter.

18:00.666 --> 18:02.666
Come on.

18:08.458 --> 18:10.583
Ha, ha. Buzz, caught you too.

18:10.666 --> 18:13.500
Aw, I'm catching everything.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.666
You're it.

18:19.500 --> 18:24.291
Ones... fives... threes

18:24.375 --> 18:28.500
and sixes and twos, nine.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.833

18:31.916 --> 18:34.916
Where are you?

18:36.666 --> 18:38.250
Wow.

18:43.458 --> 18:46.666
Uh, I don't think we should touch it.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.708
Come on.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.333
Hey.

18:55.875 --> 18:59.500
I've got it. Yeah, I'm on it. Woo-hoo!

19:04.791 --> 19:08.500
Uh-oh. Meow, meow, meow!
