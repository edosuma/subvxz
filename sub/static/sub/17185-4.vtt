John, listen to me.
This is what I want you to do.

35:38.886 --> 35:42.222
I want you to open that door and run.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.141
The instant that door cracks open,
you run.

35:53.067 --> 35:54.109
John.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.404
Yeah, I run.

36:05.538 --> 36:08.582
So, what do you think Future John
would do right now?

36:08.749 --> 36:10.500
We'll see.

JOHN:
Come on!

38:11.539 --> 38:14.207
-I thought you said you could drive.
-It's jammed or something.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.542
Step on the clutch.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.382
Hard.

38:46.282 --> 38:49.617
If you're gonna be a hero,
you gotta learn how to drive stick.

May I come in?

40:04.318 --> 40:05.819
Thank you.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.240
Hey.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.991
Pepperoni?

40:12.159 --> 40:15.036
Ha, ha. I love those things.

40:16.330 --> 40:18.540
My bosses told me
I should stay clear of you.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.668
Legal reasons.

40:21.836 --> 40:22.836
I understand.

40:23.003 --> 40:25.171
But I thought I owed it to you to drop by.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.173
-Give you a warning.
-A warning?

40:27.341 --> 40:31.469
Well, there's a chance,
a small chance, but a chance...

40:31.637 --> 40:34.681
...that there's someone out there
who might be trying to steal your identity.

40:34.849 --> 40:37.350
Steal my identity?

40:38.227 --> 40:41.771
-What would they do with that?
-What do people do with anything?

SARAH: Not every version
of the Golem story ends badly.

41:15.055 --> 41:16.556
In one, the monster is a hero...

41:16.724 --> 41:19.767
...destroying all those
that seek to harm its maker.

41:24.398 --> 41:27.275
In another,
the Golem's maker destroys his creature...

41:27.443 --> 41:29.110
...before it destroys the world.

The pride of men, of parents as well...

42:39.431 --> 42:43.476
...makes us believe
that anything we create, we can control.

Whether from clay or from metal...

42:47.523 --> 42:51.067
...it is in the nature of us
to make our own monsters.

built from our own imperfect flesh.
