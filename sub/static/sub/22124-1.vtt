towards the light,

10:03.690 --> 10:06.040
the only thing stronger
than his desperate desire

the sun-- its relentless heat

[sighs]

13:35.989 --> 13:38.818
Uh, through here. Go.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.954
So what happened?

13:44.998 --> 13:46.782
It was terrible, Brother.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.001
I was kidnapped.

13:48.044 --> 13:51.308
No, Luci. I meant Mom.

13:51.352 --> 13:54.007
Ah. Well, didn'’t
you get my text?

13:54.050 --> 13:57.706
What? You mean the string
of nonsensical emojis?

flashlight, thumbs up.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.235
How am I supposed
to know what that means?

14:05.279 --> 14:06.671
I ignited the
flaming sword,

14:06.715 --> 14:08.717
used it to cut a hole
in space and time,

14:08.760 --> 14:09.892
Mum'’s light
flooded through it,

14:09.936 --> 14:11.894
then it closed up
behind her. All good!

14:15.245 --> 14:18.901
Mom'’s... Mom is gone?

14:18.945 --> 14:20.990
Yes.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.992
Yes. I mean, she
says good-bye forever,

14:23.036 --> 14:26.909
she loves you very much,
et cetera, et cetera, but

14:26.953 --> 14:28.998
the good news is...

14:29.042 --> 14:31.000
you get your necklace back.

14:31.044 --> 14:33.785
And we all know how
attached to that you are.

14:33.829 --> 14:36.614
So, back to more
current issues.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.094
Me and my kidnapping.

14:38.138 --> 14:39.966
Now, clearly Dad is behind it,

14:40.009 --> 14:41.793
but the question is,
who'’s his emissary,

14:41.837 --> 14:44.057
and how were they able
to render me unconscious?

14:44.100 --> 14:46.146
Either they used some kind
of celestial weapon,

14:46.189 --> 14:47.495
or the detective was nearby.

14:47.538 --> 14:48.931
And if it'’s the latter,
then it has

14:48.975 --> 14:50.977
to be someone who knows
she makes me vulnerable.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.024
Hang on.

14:55.068 --> 15:00.116
The "A" on the key chain
is for Amenadiel, isn'’t it?

15:00.160 --> 15:02.945
What?
Of course.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.034
It'’s you!
Now that God'’s favorite son's

15:05.078 --> 15:08.951
regained his powers, he'’s back
to being his little bitch.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.040
Luci,
I didn'’t get my powers back.

15:11.084 --> 15:14.391
Yes, I was able
to slow time, but...

15:14.435 --> 15:18.178
uh, that appears
to have been a one-time thing.

15:18.221 --> 15:21.268
But... you have got
your wings back, huh?

15:21.311 --> 15:22.965
No.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.272
Not yet.

15:25.315 --> 15:28.797
Well, isn'’t that ironic?

15:28.840 --> 15:31.104
You want your wings back
and didn'’t get them, and...

15:31.147 --> 15:34.803
I...

15:34.846 --> 15:37.371
get whacked over the head
and hauled out to the desert.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.677
That'’s not ironic.

15:39.721 --> 15:40.896
Well, not ironic ironic.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.376
More...

15:42.419 --> 15:43.986
Anyway, the point is,

15:44.030 --> 15:46.336
I'’m sure your full powers
will come back in no time.

15:46.380 --> 15:48.164
You probably
just need... a good nap.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.210
Or eat some mangos.
I'’ve heard they work wonders.

15:50.253 --> 15:52.212

We got a suspect.

15:54.127 --> 15:56.042
First, it looked like
it had been wiped down.

15:56.085 --> 15:59.784
Then, I whipped out the color
fluorescent film, and whammo.

15:59.828 --> 16:02.744
Well done,
Miss Lopez...Mm-hmm.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.398
Oh, sorry.

I mean,

16:09.229 --> 16:13.276
I'’ve seen you around, doing your
handsome broody thing, but...

16:13.320 --> 16:18.064
Anyway, any bro
of Lucifer'’s is a bro of mine.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.029

16:27.073 --> 16:29.945
Enough of that.
We have a suspect. Shall we?

16:31.120 --> 16:34.732

29:27.940 --> 29:31.770
You a believer?

29:31.813 --> 29:34.816
Well, then, whatever it is
you'’re going through,

29:34.860 --> 29:37.906
I'’m sure it's all part
of His plan.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.690
I mean, even the most

29:39.734 --> 29:43.216
pathetic, sad sack, powerless of
creatures serve a purpose.

29:43.259 --> 29:45.871
Like Leo here.

29:48.830 --> 29:51.790
A van may have cracked his nuts
in the middle of the desert,

29:51.833 --> 29:54.836
but he'’s still
valuable evidence.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.969
That'’s the thing.
You never know

29:57.012 --> 29:59.798
when your rock-bottom pain
and humiliation

29:59.841 --> 30:01.756
can end up helping others.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.150
I mean, God works
in mysterious ways.

30:04.193 --> 30:07.370
So you just got to believe
that when He crushes your nuts,

30:07.414 --> 30:09.242
He does it for a reason.

30:09.285 --> 30:10.591
Has this, um,

30:10.634 --> 30:14.551
Leo provided you with
a break in your case?

30:15.335 --> 30:17.380
Not yet.

30:17.424 --> 30:20.253
But you got
to have faith, right?

30:20.296 --> 30:25.040
Right. Right.

30:28.957 --> 30:30.872
The kidnappers
are seven minutes late.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.527
Yeah, well, we didn'’t give them
a lot of prep time; don'’t worry.

30:33.570 --> 30:35.094
I'’m worried.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.225
Where are they?

30:36.269 --> 30:38.532
They'’ll be here.

30:38.575 --> 30:39.925
[quietly]:
Come on.

30:39.968 --> 30:42.579
Come on, be here. Be here.

30:42.623 --> 30:44.973
[tires screech]

30:47.976 --> 30:50.718
Oh, lovely.
Right on time.

30:52.589 --> 30:53.939
Hello. Right. How do we do...

30:53.982 --> 30:56.245
Oh, careful. I bruise
like a peach.

30:56.289 --> 30:57.246
[grunts]

30:57.290 --> 30:59.031
Easy.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.514
[phone buzzes]

31:11.086 --> 31:12.914
Seriously?

31:20.617 --> 31:22.750
[water dripping]

31:22.793 --> 31:22.924
LUCIFER:
Ah, there you are.

31:26.101 --> 31:28.974
I have to say, the leaky pipe
is a nice touch.

31:29.017 --> 31:31.367
Very Blood Simple.

31:31.411 --> 31:33.282
Coen Brothers movie?

31:33.326 --> 31:35.110
No?

31:35.154 --> 31:37.112
Oh.

31:37.156 --> 31:38.592
Well,

31:38.635 --> 31:40.507
hello, kidnappers.

31:40.550 --> 31:44.163
Finally, I have you
right where I want you.

31:44.206 --> 31:46.252
[both chuckle]

31:46.295 --> 31:48.210
[chuckles]

31:48.254 --> 31:50.430
Let'’s see,
so many questions,

31:50.473 --> 31:53.085
but let'’s start with: how did
you abduct me the first time?

31:53.128 --> 31:55.565
Hmm? How did you
render me unconscious?

31:55.609 --> 31:57.611
[laughing]:
Ow. What are you doing?

31:57.654 --> 31:58.917
Stop it, that tickles.

32:00.614 --> 32:01.571
[grunts]

32:04.183 --> 32:05.445
We used this
last week, right?

32:05.488 --> 32:06.446
Yeah.

32:06.489 --> 32:08.927
Did you forget
to charge it?

32:08.970 --> 32:10.841
No. I didn'’t forget
to charge it.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.843
[high-pitched scream]
Dude.

32:12.887 --> 32:14.454
Not cool.I just don'’t get it.

32:14.497 --> 32:16.151
I don'’t know.I hate to interrupt.

32:16.195 --> 32:17.370
[both gasp]

32:17.413 --> 32:18.371
[clears throat]

32:19.850 --> 32:21.069
Where were we?

32:23.593 --> 32:26.292
Remind me not to leave Lucifer
in the front seat unattended.

32:26.335 --> 32:28.033
And remind me
to kick his ass

32:28.076 --> 32:29.295
for humiliating me
in front of Pierce.

32:29.338 --> 32:31.210
Well, I'’ll help you
if we can find him.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.602
Look...

32:32.646 --> 32:33.995
don'’t worry, Chloe.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.736
Lucifer can take
care of himself.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.390
Found Lucifer'’s phone...

32:37.433 --> 32:39.087
in some bushes
on Alameda Street.

32:39.131 --> 32:40.959
Kidnappers must have
tossed it.

32:41.002 --> 32:42.134
What about, uh, traffic cams?

32:42.177 --> 32:43.787
Maybe we can pull
a plate number.
No.

32:43.831 --> 32:46.181
I checked everything
within a mile radius. Nada.

32:46.225 --> 32:48.183
Must have grabbed him
in a blind spot.

32:48.227 --> 32:49.706
Unfortunately,

32:49.750 --> 32:51.621
I think we'’re dealing with
some pretty crafty bad guys.

32:51.665 --> 32:52.796
MAN:
I...

32:52.840 --> 32:54.320
can'’t... breathe!

32:54.363 --> 32:56.235
[groaning,
crying]

32:56.278 --> 32:59.107
Please don'’t crush him.
We'’ve only just begun.

32:59.151 --> 33:02.023
No. Come on, man.
Ask us anything!

33:02.067 --> 33:03.242
[cries]

33:03.285 --> 33:04.895
All right.

33:04.939 --> 33:07.072
My face--
how did you do it?

33:07.115 --> 33:09.030
What?!Well, the wings
are one thing,

33:09.074 --> 33:12.251
but my Devil face--
how did you take that?

33:12.294 --> 33:14.514
We'’ve never seen
you before, man!

33:14.557 --> 33:15.994
Yeah, man.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.430
Never heard of you before today.

33:17.473 --> 33:20.650
I just got a name--
Daniel LaDoosh-- a pickup point,

33:20.694 --> 33:23.001
and that you got a thing
for gerbils.

33:23.044 --> 33:25.438
[crying]I suppose you also deny
abducting Mr. Banales

33:25.481 --> 33:28.049
and leaving him to perish
in the desert, do you?

33:28.093 --> 33:30.051
He'’s the client
from last week, man!

33:30.095 --> 33:31.531
Right, man.

33:31.574 --> 33:33.185
His friend got him
the deluxe package.

33:33.228 --> 33:35.187
We did the
detail work here,

33:35.230 --> 33:36.536
and then our partner Sam
picked him up,

33:36.579 --> 33:38.364
took him to the spider hole
for a few hours,

33:38.407 --> 33:40.496
and dropped him
back off at the hotel.Well, then,

33:40.540 --> 33:42.237
it seems
your colleague took a detour.

33:42.281 --> 33:43.717
Where does this Sam live?

33:43.760 --> 33:44.848
Koreatown!

33:44.892 --> 33:46.154
It'’s a pink building on Leeward.

33:46.198 --> 33:50.071
Apartment?
5B, man! 5B!

33:50.115 --> 33:52.508
Lovely. Thanks for your help.

33:52.552 --> 33:53.553
Hey, man!

33:53.596 --> 33:55.294
[crying]Will you let
us go, man?

33:55.337 --> 33:57.470
[both scream]

33:57.513 --> 33:59.863
ELLA:
So, prints off the
key chain led to Josh.

33:59.907 --> 34:02.605
CHLOE:
Right. Tire treads
on the roadkill led to nothing.

34:02.649 --> 34:04.781
There'’s got to be
something we'’re missing.

34:04.825 --> 34:06.174
Maybe Lancaster has something.

34:06.218 --> 34:07.784
We'’re screwed.

34:07.828 --> 34:09.221
Or not.

34:09.264 --> 34:11.005
Remember the detective
who found the key chain?

34:11.049 --> 34:13.312
He doesn'’t exist, at least
not at Lancaster PD.

34:13.355 --> 34:15.140
They only sent patrol
units to the scene.

34:15.183 --> 34:17.098
Whoa. You think
that was our guy?

34:17.142 --> 34:19.318
Killers often return to
the scene of the crime.

34:19.361 --> 34:20.232
DAN:
Which means

34:20.275 --> 34:21.276
he wasn'’t finding evidence.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.669
He was trying to steal it.

34:22.712 --> 34:24.018
Should have known.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.498
Why should you have known?

34:25.541 --> 34:27.413
Lancaster doesn'’t know us,
we don'’t know them.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.110
Look, let'’s just look through
these photos, try and find him

34:29.154 --> 34:31.199
in the background, okay?Yes, and then we
can nail his ass

34:31.243 --> 34:33.114
with facial
recognition software.

34:34.246 --> 34:35.899
Here he is.

34:35.943 --> 34:37.814
But his back'’s to us.

34:37.858 --> 34:40.295
You guys... oh, my gosh.

34:40.339 --> 34:42.689
I knew... I knew
he didn'’t die in vain.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.952
What?
Who?

34:44.995 --> 34:47.172
Leo. See, look.

34:47.215 --> 34:49.783
There'’s our suspect,
right, leaving the scene,

34:49.826 --> 34:52.046
walking towards that van.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.309
Ryuk Road Crusher tires.

34:54.353 --> 34:55.441
Commercial grade.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.443
That'’s the van
that ran over Leo.

34:57.486 --> 34:59.271
I mean, this
pretty much confirms

34:59.314 --> 35:01.142
that this guy'’s
our killer.
CHLOE:
Okay.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.404
So maybe we can
get an ID.

35:02.448 --> 35:04.667
Let'’s run
the license plate.

35:09.672 --> 35:11.892
[knocking]

35:35.916 --> 35:37.222
Remember me?

35:42.270 --> 35:44.490
It'’s you.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.100
Yes.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.450
You know me as the Devil you so
rudely turned into an angel

35:48.494 --> 35:49.886
and then dumped
in the middle of the desert,

35:49.930 --> 35:51.801
but I don'’t know you,
so, come on,

35:51.845 --> 35:53.194
introduce yourself.

35:53.238 --> 35:54.543
I'’m Sam.Yes, yes,

35:54.587 --> 35:56.241
I know that, but what are you?

35:56.284 --> 35:58.286
And how did my Father
get his hooks into you?

35:58.330 --> 35:59.418
Your father?

35:59.461 --> 36:01.289
Oh, come on,
don'’t be coy.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.725
Let me see.

36:02.769 --> 36:05.206
Unless Dad got jiggy
with some celestial babe

36:05.250 --> 36:07.382
after Mum, then
you'’re not my sibling,

36:07.426 --> 36:09.689
so... demon. Hmm?

36:09.732 --> 36:10.907
Changeling?

36:10.951 --> 36:13.823
I work for
an extreme kidnapping company.

36:13.867 --> 36:14.955
Snatched.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.348
Oh, do you now?
Well, do you know what?

36:16.391 --> 36:17.697
It doesn'’t matter
what you are because...

36:17.740 --> 36:19.307
this should take care of you.

36:19.351 --> 36:20.439
Whoa! Whoa!

36:20.482 --> 36:22.223
Whoa! I-- I'’m sorry.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.791
I'’m sorry I left you
in the desert.

36:24.834 --> 36:26.532
I really am.

36:26.575 --> 36:29.056
And I'’m sorry I left
that Steve guy there, too.

36:29.099 --> 36:30.666
I-- He was just a routine gig.

36:30.710 --> 36:31.972
I was gonna swap him for you,

36:32.015 --> 36:33.843
but when I went to
pull you out of the van,

36:33.887 --> 36:38.196
you... you had
friggin'’ wings, man!

36:38.239 --> 36:40.198
Well, duh!
Wings that you put there

36:40.241 --> 36:41.416
at the behest of my Father!

36:41.460 --> 36:43.418
Now stop lying!I'’m not!

36:43.462 --> 36:45.768
I didn'’t mean to hurt anyone.

36:45.812 --> 36:46.943
I swear.

36:46.987 --> 36:48.510
And believe me,
I didn'’t want to run,

36:48.554 --> 36:50.251
but you scared
the hell out of me.

36:50.295 --> 36:51.383
Right, you listen, Sammy,

36:51.426 --> 36:53.080
I know you'’re
just the messenger,

36:53.123 --> 36:55.996
so why don'’t you deliver
a message on my behalf?

36:57.432 --> 37:01.784
Idefine who I am, not Him.

37:01.828 --> 37:03.003
Me!

37:03.046 --> 37:04.874
[cries]

37:04.918 --> 37:08.356
Oh, bloody hell.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.445
They'’re back, aren't they?

37:10.489 --> 37:12.099
How?[whoosh]

37:12.142 --> 37:13.492
How are you doing this?

37:13.535 --> 37:15.494
Did my Father
give you some kind of totem?

37:15.537 --> 37:16.712
A talisman?

37:16.756 --> 37:18.497
What?I'’m telling you, I don't...

37:18.540 --> 37:20.673
I don'’t know what's happening.

37:20.716 --> 37:22.631
And I don'’t know your dad.

37:22.675 --> 37:26.635
Unless, is your,
is your dad the Sinnerman?

37:28.507 --> 37:31.161
Quite the opposite.
Who'’s the Sinnerman?

37:31.205 --> 37:32.162
That'’s, that's who,

37:32.206 --> 37:33.990
who hired me to kidnap you.

37:34.034 --> 37:37.429
He'’s, he's, he'’s a scary dude.

37:37.472 --> 37:39.996
Huge crime boss.
I owed him big time.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.955
But because I didn'’t
finish the job,

37:41.998 --> 37:43.217
I'’m as good as dead now.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.436
That'’s why I was running.

37:44.479 --> 37:46.394
And where do I find
this Sinnerman?

37:46.438 --> 37:47.917
You don'’t.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.310
He finds you.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.572
CHLOE:
Lucifer?

37:53.445 --> 37:54.881
Get up.

37:54.924 --> 37:56.012
Up.

37:56.056 --> 37:58.580
Come on, get up.

37:58.624 --> 38:00.843
Put your hands
behind your back.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.326
What happened to you?I...

38:08.024 --> 38:09.722
I don'’t know.

38:21.037 --> 38:23.213
Decker, it ain'’t good.

38:23.257 --> 38:25.433
Lieutenant, look, I-I know
what you'’re gonna say.

38:25.477 --> 38:26.956
And, even though
we caught our guy,

38:27.000 --> 38:30.133
Lucifer was way out of line,
and I-I don'’t disagree,

38:30.177 --> 38:31.613
but here'’s what
you got to know

38:31.657 --> 38:33.354
about our unorthodox methods...

38:33.398 --> 38:34.834
Detective, you...I am Lucifer'’s partner,

38:34.877 --> 38:38.185
yes, you'’re right,
but you know what?

38:38.228 --> 38:39.621
He'’s mine, too.

38:39.665 --> 38:42.798
And, for whatever reason,
we make an effective team.

38:42.842 --> 38:46.498
And will be even more so
when I stop investing

38:46.541 --> 38:50.284
on a, um... personal level.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.155
I am here to solve crimes.

38:52.199 --> 38:54.636
Not to see his... his thing

38:54.680 --> 38:56.421
or whatever, which is...

38:56.464 --> 39:00.163
not something
that you need to know.

39:00.207 --> 39:01.774
Right. Look, point is,

39:01.817 --> 39:04.733
you can say what you want,
but I know I'’m a good detective

39:04.777 --> 39:07.257
and I have a damn good
solve rate to prove that.

39:07.301 --> 39:08.911
Okay.

39:11.044 --> 39:12.088
Okay.

39:12.132 --> 39:13.438
Okay.

39:13.481 --> 39:15.614
I just came down here

39:15.657 --> 39:18.138
to let you know that your perp
has been released on bail.

39:18.181 --> 39:19.357
Oh.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.184
W-Wait, how is that possible?

39:21.228 --> 39:22.229
Don'’t know.

39:22.272 --> 39:23.448
Friends in high places, I guess.

39:23.491 --> 39:24.666
But there'’s got to be something.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.494
I mean, don'’t-don't you care?

39:26.538 --> 39:28.148
You do what you can, Decker.

39:28.191 --> 39:29.715
You can'’t save them all.

39:29.758 --> 39:31.194
Oh.

39:31.238 --> 39:34.415
But, um, good luck
with Lucifer'’s... thing

39:34.459 --> 39:36.025
or whatever.

39:53.565 --> 39:55.784
[elevator bell dings]

39:59.571 --> 40:02.661
Oh, hello, Brother.

40:02.704 --> 40:04.663
So, did Remedy cure
what ails you?

40:04.706 --> 40:06.404
Did her massage
make anything

40:06.447 --> 40:07.535
pop out?

40:07.579 --> 40:08.754
Talking about your wings,
of course.

40:08.797 --> 40:12.627
No, mine are still absent.

40:12.671 --> 40:14.499
But yours, on the other hand...

40:16.762 --> 40:19.417
[softly]:
Oh.

40:19.460 --> 40:20.635
Lucifer, I'’m not angry with you

40:20.679 --> 40:22.811
that you somehow
got your wings back,

40:22.855 --> 40:24.465
or even that you
cut them off again,

40:24.509 --> 40:28.426
as foul as that may be.

40:28.469 --> 40:30.558
I'’m angry with myself.

40:31.559 --> 40:33.648
Because somehow I made you feel

40:33.692 --> 40:35.694
like you couldn'’t confide in me.

40:35.737 --> 40:38.871
Well, comparing body parts
is never good for the male ego,

40:38.914 --> 40:40.742
especially between brothers.

40:40.786 --> 40:43.832
But that'’s just it, Luci.

40:43.876 --> 40:47.357
My ego should never be an issue.

40:47.401 --> 40:50.448
I am an angel.

40:50.491 --> 40:51.623
A soldier of God.

40:51.666 --> 40:54.016
His favorite son.

40:54.060 --> 40:56.236
Oh, that'’s gonna be a thing,
isn'’t it?

40:56.279 --> 40:59.326
[stifled laugh]

40:59.369 --> 41:02.329
Listen, Father, He...

41:02.372 --> 41:04.853
works in mysterious ways.

41:04.897 --> 41:07.856
I was tested once and I failed.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.902
I'’m not gonna fail again.

41:09.945 --> 41:12.252
Because this time, I have faith.

41:12.295 --> 41:15.734
Excellent.

41:15.777 --> 41:18.476
And I suppose
this won'’t bother you.

41:18.519 --> 41:20.826
[whoosh]

41:23.785 --> 41:26.135
But you...

41:26.179 --> 41:27.746
you cut them off.

41:27.789 --> 41:30.575
I did, but the pesky things
seem to be a bit more tenacious

41:30.618 --> 41:32.664
this time around.

41:32.707 --> 41:35.101
Well, like I said, I have faith.

41:35.144 --> 41:37.538
I'’m sure it's all
a part of God'’s plan.

41:37.582 --> 41:38.844
[laughing]:
Yes!

41:38.887 --> 41:40.628
If you mean his plan
to continually manipulate

41:40.672 --> 41:42.761
and control me, then agreed.

41:42.804 --> 41:44.632
Because, by the way,

41:44.676 --> 41:47.026
he didn'’t just
give my wings back,

41:47.069 --> 41:49.028
he took my Devil face as well.

41:50.943 --> 41:53.249
Luci, do you realize
what this means?

41:53.293 --> 41:56.426
Perhaps Father is trying
to show you that,

41:56.470 --> 41:57.558
that you'’ve been forgiven.

41:57.602 --> 41:59.995
What if I don'’t want
His forgiveness?

42:00.039 --> 42:03.651
But, Brother,
if you can be redeemed,

42:03.695 --> 42:05.261
that means that anyone can.

42:06.828 --> 42:09.570
Now, isn'’t that divine?

42:09.614 --> 42:12.268
[scoffs]

42:12.312 --> 42:16.185
I'’m not sure that
this is divinity at work here.

42:16.229 --> 42:19.624
[sighs]

42:19.667 --> 42:23.715
Have you ever heard
of someone named the Sinnerman?

42:24.846 --> 42:26.369
The Sinnerman?

42:29.764 --> 42:31.418
No.

42:31.461 --> 42:33.725
Why?

42:35.640 --> 42:37.685
That'’s who kidnapped me.

42:48.653 --> 42:49.654
At first, I thought it was a...

42:49.697 --> 42:51.569
an emissary on Earth

42:51.612 --> 42:53.527
working on Dad'’s behalf, but
then, the more I think about it,

42:53.571 --> 42:55.529
the more I think...

42:55.573 --> 42:59.577
maybe this isn'’t our Father
who art in Heaven at all.

43:05.670 --> 43:06.627
But something much,

43:06.671 --> 43:10.109
much darker.
