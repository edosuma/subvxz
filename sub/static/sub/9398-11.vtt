WEBVTT

00:01.768 --> 00:03.827
- Hey, guys, it's Sophia Bush.
- And Hilarie Burton.

00:03.903 --> 00:06.235
And we wanna wish you guys
a very Happy New Year

00:06.306 --> 00:08.206
and thank you
for supporting <i>One Tree Hill.</i>

00:08.274 --> 00:09.536
It's been a great season so far

00:09.609 --> 00:12.203
and we have some amazing new episodes
coming your way

00:12.278 --> 00:13.438
so don't go anywhere.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.175
It's all starting right here, next on the CW.

00:17.250 --> 00:20.117
Have you noticed that Lucas
has really weird stuff in his room?

00:20.186 --> 00:21.175
Yeah.

00:21.254 --> 00:24.485
I mean, who do you think gave him this?

00:24.557 --> 00:27.048
- Oh, I'd say Brooke.
- No, I'd say Peyton.

00:27.127 --> 00:28.219
Really?

00:29.062 --> 00:30.723
Here we go again.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.064
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:34.134 --> 00:36.125
Lose that game.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.064
<i>Nathan Scott drives to the hoop!</i>

00:39.139 --> 00:42.108
<i>He passes to Lucas</i>
<i>for a three and the win!</i>

00:43.777 --> 00:46.746
<i>The Tree Hill Ravens</i>
<i>are champions at last.</i>

00:46.813 --> 00:48.542
Nathan, look out!

00:51.051 --> 00:52.245
Haley!

00:57.290 --> 00:58.450
Nathan!

00:58.525 --> 00:59.856
He's dead.

00:59.926 --> 01:00.984
Go!

01:01.961 --> 01:03.724
She's been hit by a car.
You gotta help her.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.196
How long has she been pregnant?

01:05.265 --> 01:06.698
<i>I didn't take my pills.</i>

01:06.766 --> 01:08.165
You just had a heart attack.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.600
- I'm dead?
- Not yet.

01:10.670 --> 01:11.728
I'm dead.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.864
<i>You are no longer my brother.</i>

01:15.075 --> 01:17.509
<i>I still don't believe</i>
<i>that Jimmy killed you, Keith.</i>

01:17.577 --> 01:19.841
We gotta talk
about what happened here, Lucas.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.380
There are things you need to know.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.985
<i>Have you ever had a dream</i>
<i>that seemed so real,</i>

01:29.055 --> 01:32.320
<i>when you woke up,</i>
<i>you didn't know what to believe?</i>

01:36.629 --> 01:40.429
<i>What would you do</i>
<i>if what you thought was true, wasn't?</i>

01:43.203 --> 01:46.172
<i>And what you thought wasn't true, was?</i>

01:56.449 --> 01:59.646
Lucas. Luke, what are you doing here?

01:59.719 --> 02:01.687
I go here. Remember?

02:01.754 --> 02:03.585
Yeah, I also remember
you had a heart attack.

02:03.656 --> 02:06.955
Well, the doctor said it was okay
if I did some light activity.

02:07.026 --> 02:10.553
I mean, I won't be training
for a marathon anytime soon,

02:11.064 --> 02:14.625
but I can still come to class
and daydream about my new girlfriend.

02:15.201 --> 02:17.328
Well, what happens in that daydream?

02:17.403 --> 02:20.167
I slowly but very gently
take her in my arms

02:20.240 --> 02:23.573
and I bring her in real close like this...

02:30.416 --> 02:31.644
Wow.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.610
The last time we kissed,
it was so damn good I collapsed.

02:35.688 --> 02:38.486
- I'm joking.
- Yeah.

02:39.359 --> 02:40.849
What's wrong?

02:44.564 --> 02:47.465
- Oh.
- Yeah. I...

02:48.535 --> 02:51.163
- You just wanna walk me to class?
- Yeah.

02:51.237 --> 02:52.329
Okay.

02:53.439 --> 02:55.236
For someone who just had a heart attack,

02:55.308 --> 02:58.766
Lucas doesn't seem to be worried
about getting his heart rate up.

02:58.845 --> 02:59.903
Questions? Comments?

02:59.979 --> 03:02.846
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinking about not speaking to you.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.315
Why? Because I did you a favor?

03:04.384 --> 03:06.545
Stealing the key
to the Tutor Center so I can break in

03:06.619 --> 03:08.109
and pilfer test answers is not a favor.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.849
It's more like a betrayal.

03:09.923 --> 03:13.654
Okay. We both know you suck at math,
but how do you figure?

03:13.726 --> 03:15.887
Well, I convince Haley to tutor you

03:15.962 --> 03:18.055
even though
she's not exactly your number one fan.

03:18.131 --> 03:21.658
So me trusting you plus you using Haley
equals betrayal.

03:21.734 --> 03:23.031
That's one way to look at it.

03:23.102 --> 03:25.696
The way I see it is,
I suffered through tutoring I didn't need

03:25.772 --> 03:26.898
to steal a key for you.

03:26.973 --> 03:29.305
- Sounds like a favor to me.
- Sounds dumb to me.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.367
- Not as dumb as flunking.
- I'm not flunking anything.

03:32.445 --> 03:35.209
I stayed up all night studying for this quiz.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.841
Now that you mention it,
you do look kind of bad today.

03:37.917 --> 03:40.715
- Lipstick?
- Just return the key to Haley, okay?

03:40.787 --> 03:42.277
- I don't need it.
- Fine.

03:42.355 --> 03:44.915
Trust me, I have never studied so hard
for something in my life.

03:44.991 --> 03:47.084
Fine, but you better start making friends
with the juniors

03:47.160 --> 03:49.094
because that's who you're gonna
be hanging out with next year.

03:49.162 --> 03:50.322
Shut up.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.590
Mouth?

03:52.198 --> 03:54.189
Hey, Gigi. How's my girl?

03:54.267 --> 03:56.394
I'm gonna break up with you.

03:57.337 --> 03:58.895
Did you just break up with me?

03:58.972 --> 04:01.566
No, not yet, but I'm going to.

04:01.641 --> 04:03.939
Just thought you should know.

04:06.779 --> 04:07.871
<i>You okay?</i>

04:07.947 --> 04:10.438
You look like you're a million miles away.

04:12.452 --> 04:14.920
- I didn't even know his name.
- Who?

04:17.322 --> 04:19.348
That poor man who hit me.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.957
"That poor man"?

04:23.563 --> 04:25.963
Haley, you were the victim.
He ran you over.

04:26.032 --> 04:28.728
I know, but it was an accident. And...

04:29.269 --> 04:30.861
And he's dead.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.269
And the way that he was killed, I...

04:33.339 --> 04:37.002
I don't know how your father
could do something like that.

04:37.910 --> 04:40.936
- Did you even know who he was?
- No.

04:42.348 --> 04:45.579
No, you were the only thing on my mind.

04:49.889 --> 04:52.187
Now, listen, I should get going,
I'm gonna be late for school,

04:52.258 --> 04:54.692
but Karen's gonna come by later
to check on you,

04:54.761 --> 04:56.661
and then I'll swing by at lunch
and bring you some soup.

04:56.729 --> 04:58.356
Okay. Chicken noodle with some extra...

04:58.431 --> 05:00.763
With extra noodles. I'm on it.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.164
Thank you.

05:05.571 --> 05:08.938
I don't know how you turned out so sweet
with a father like Dan.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.491
Good news or bad news?

05:26.559 --> 05:29.221
You're my lawyer.
Do you ever have good news?

05:29.295 --> 05:30.819
Okay, bad news.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.458
You're being charged
with second-degree murder.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.434
Your arraignment is scheduled
for tomorrow,

05:36.502 --> 05:39.130
at which time we'll file a plea of not guilty.

05:39.205 --> 05:40.467
In a few weeks, we'll go to trial,

05:40.540 --> 05:43.168
so we need to be prepared
for an investigation.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.506
I don't want an investigation.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.344
It's standard procedure.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.973
I'm guilty. I wanna plead guilty.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.711
Well, I wouldn't recommend that.

06:44.537 --> 06:46.437
You're not pleading guilty.

06:46.506 --> 06:49.805
You shouldn't be paying for something
that I did, okay?

06:49.876 --> 06:52.003
- I'm confessing.
- Don't be a fool, Nathan.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.136
What do you want, Dad?

06:53.212 --> 06:55.339
Twenty years to life?
'Cause that's what you'll get.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.645
And not here.
They'll send you to a state prison,

06:57.717 --> 07:01.050
and when you get out, if you get out,
you'll be so old your life will be over.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.020
Better mine than yours.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.147
Nathan, when you came to me
asking for money,

07:05.224 --> 07:08.284
I looked at you
and saw a kid in over his head.

07:08.795 --> 07:13.164
But what I should have seen was
a son who needed his father's help.

07:13.232 --> 07:17.066
I should have given you the money.
I could have prevented this.

07:17.136 --> 07:19.400
No offense, Dad, but so what?

07:19.906 --> 07:22.033
You're not guilty of murder.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.974
I have sins to pay for, Nathan.

07:26.345 --> 07:27.903
I belong here.

07:29.015 --> 07:31.813
I don't belong here. I'm a good person.

07:32.251 --> 07:35.516
So I pop pills, I haven't killed anybody.

07:37.523 --> 07:40.981
Sure, maybe I started a fire once.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.459
And I...

07:42.528 --> 07:47.363
I did discharge a firearm recently,
but it was an accident.

07:47.433 --> 07:50.891
The bottom line is, I don't need this place.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.801
- Deb, I've been in your shoes.
- Gucci? I don't think so.

07:56.776 --> 07:59.370
- Denial is not your friend.
- Oh, God.

07:59.445 --> 08:00.742
Give this program a chance

08:00.813 --> 08:03.145
and you just might find
that rehab can help you.

08:03.216 --> 08:07.084
Help me?
This place makes me want to take pills.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.213
All I hear around here
is whine, whine, whine, whine.

08:10.289 --> 08:13.383
Don't say wine. I'm an alcoholic.

08:13.459 --> 08:17.395
Oh, my God. Get me out of here.

08:17.463 --> 08:18.657
God.

08:22.001 --> 08:25.164
So, listen,
there's something I haven't told anybody.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.206
Oh, I love secrets.

08:27.273 --> 08:31.073
Well, when I was unconscious, I saw Keith.

08:31.744 --> 08:34.042
Luke, you and Nate should really talk.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.577
Not in, like, <i>The Sixth Sense</i> sort of way,

08:37.650 --> 08:40.015
but it felt so real.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.144
Well, don't laugh,

08:41.220 --> 08:43.450
but anytime I have a dream
about my mom or Ellie,

08:43.523 --> 08:46.253
I like to think it's their way
of contacting me from the other side.

08:46.325 --> 08:50.591
Like dreams are e-mails for ghosts,
it's their way of sending me a message.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.096
Okay.

08:52.164 --> 08:54.655
Well, look, if there's
the remotest possibility that you're right,

08:54.734 --> 08:57.726
then what message
was Keith trying to send me?

08:57.803 --> 09:00.704
Well, I don't know.
What'd you guys talk about?

09:00.773 --> 09:02.297
You, mostly.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.571
What?
Does my breath stink or something?

09:08.648 --> 09:11.913
- No, no, you smell really good.
- Okay, then, what?

09:13.519 --> 09:16.147
- I'm just not a really big fan of PDA.
- Since when?

09:16.222 --> 09:18.952
Since whenever.
It just makes me uncomfortable.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.652
Good to know.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.388
So, what, does PDA
include holding hands? Hugging?

09:23.462 --> 09:25.362
Yeah, I guess so.

09:25.431 --> 09:28.161
Probably. I don't know. Maybe not. I...

09:29.535 --> 09:32.368
- I have English, I should go.
- Okay.

09:33.105 --> 09:34.595
I'll see you.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.543
What just happened?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.417
<i>Hi, Mouth, it's me, Gigi.</i>

09:55.494 --> 09:56.791
I can see that.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.126
Quick question,
what do you like better, text or IM?

09:59.198 --> 10:01.598
- For when?
- For when I break up with you.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.635
Gigi, I don't want you to break up with me.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.467
Then do you want to break up with me?

10:06.539 --> 10:09.633
If so, I like IMs.
You can even use emoticons.

10:09.709 --> 10:12.007
I don't want either of us to break up
with either of us.

10:12.244 --> 10:14.178
But if we did?

10:14.847 --> 10:17.441
Face to face.
I would want to break up in person.

10:17.516 --> 10:18.676
<i>I'll make a note of that</i>
<i>and get back to you.</i>

10:18.751 --> 10:21.845
But don't get me wrong,
I don't wanna break up.

10:22.321 --> 10:25.813
Okay, people, clear your desks,
get your pencils ready.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.925
I know you don't think you need it,
but good luck.

10:29.996 --> 10:34.057
Just because you wanna resort
to theft instead of hard work,

10:34.166 --> 10:36.293
doesn't mean I have to.

10:36.736 --> 10:37.930
Oh, look, pink quizzes?

10:38.671 --> 10:41.469
Not quite.
It's a flyer for that weirdo virgin club.

10:43.342 --> 10:46.607
That "weirdo virgin club"
is called Clean Teens.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.006
Hi, Shelly.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.605
Still trying to save the school
one Rachel at a time?

10:50.683 --> 10:54.449
We're meeting tonight in Room 104.
Be there or be sluts.

10:58.824 --> 10:59.813
Suit yourself.

10:59.892 --> 11:02.258
But if you change your mind,
the door is always open.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.296
Just like Rachel's legs.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.465
Okay, you've got 30 minutes
to complete this quiz.

11:11.937 --> 11:14.701
When I call time, I want pencils down.

11:15.941 --> 11:17.203
Ready?

11:17.810 --> 11:18.868
I sure am.

11:18.944 --> 11:20.275
And begin.

11:24.316 --> 11:28.252
<i>Mayor Scott is being held without bail</i>
<i>as the investigation continues.</i>

11:28.621 --> 11:30.851
Chicken noodle, extra noodle.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.322
How you feeling?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.367
I was thinking about reaching out
to Daunte's family.

11:45.004 --> 11:48.667
- That's the name of the man that hit me.
- Who told you that?

11:48.741 --> 11:51.335
It's been on the news all day.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.878
Apparently he was
some kind of bookie or gambler.

11:53.946 --> 11:57.143
But he was somebody's child,
and now that I'm gonna be a mother...

11:57.216 --> 12:00.014
Who are we without forgiveness,
you know?

12:00.086 --> 12:04.022
And now all these people not only
lost the person that they loved,

12:04.090 --> 12:07.753
but they have to live with the fact
that he almost killed a person.

12:09.128 --> 12:10.993
Two people.

12:11.864 --> 12:14.833
And I just thought maybe,
if I could let them know that I'm not angry,

12:14.900 --> 12:16.925
it might ease their pain.

12:19.271 --> 12:20.966
It was my fault.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.600
- What was your fault?
- The accident,

12:24.043 --> 12:25.271
my father being sent to prison,

12:25.344 --> 12:28.279
everything that happened that night
was my fault.

12:28.347 --> 12:31.282
- What are you talking about?
- I knew Daunte.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.515
I borrowed some money from him.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.453
Look, we couldn't pay our bills
and my dad turned me away,

12:36.522 --> 12:38.217
my mom was on drugs,

12:38.290 --> 12:40.622
and all I had to do was just
shave a few points off the spread.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.558
Just win by less.

12:42.628 --> 12:46.325
And I swear to God, Haley,
I thought that it would be over after that,

12:46.398 --> 12:48.559
but Daunte wasn't finished.

12:50.202 --> 12:52.466
He wanted me to lose
the State Championship.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.301
Which you didn't do.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.899
Haley, listen, I'm so sorry, okay?

12:58.978 --> 13:01.208
But I was scared, and he threatened me.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.406
I was trying to lose the game,

13:02.481 --> 13:06.679
but then you told me
that we were gonna have a boy,

13:07.386 --> 13:09.718
and I just stopped being scared.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.122
All that mattered to me was
you and our unborn son.

13:13.192 --> 13:16.286
So my accident was
just Daunte's revenge?

13:16.362 --> 13:18.125
Haley, I wish to God it was me.

13:18.197 --> 13:20.597
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.570
Look, there's something else.

13:28.374 --> 13:31.275
It wasn't my dad who beat Daunte.

13:32.211 --> 13:33.610
It was me.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.741
Haley, I saw you lying in the
street and I just... I lost my mind, okay?

13:37.817 --> 13:40.149
Please, you have to forgive me.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.316
You've no idea how hard it is for me
to see you like this.

13:45.257 --> 13:48.454
Not as hard as it is for me
to see you like this.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.778
You're a lucky man, Dan Scott.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.679
I thought my arraignment
wasn't until tomorrow.

14:14.753 --> 14:16.744
Your arraignment's been canceled.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.052
The coroner's report was just released.

14:19.124 --> 14:23.117
Turns out that good old Daunte
wasn't beaten to death after all.

14:24.263 --> 14:25.457
What do you mean?

14:25.531 --> 14:28.591
Cause of death, internal injuries
suffered during the car crash.

14:28.667 --> 14:32.000
Daunte died on impact
before a single hand was laid on him.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.502
You're innocent, Mr. Mayor.

14:37.576 --> 14:39.942
How's it feel to be a free man?

14:40.112 --> 14:42.410
I feel as though a weight
has been lifted off my shoulders.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.312
I couldn't be more relieved.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.147
I'd like to thank my lawyer and family
for their support.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.120
Mr. Mayor, how do you think this is going
to affect your political future?

14:50.189 --> 14:51.383
Mr. Mayor, will you run for office again?

14:51.457 --> 14:55.484
However, while I have been cleared
of these charges,

14:55.561 --> 14:59.292
I can't overlook the fact that I responded
to a dire situation in a violent manner.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.299
- What do you have to say to the voters?
- Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor.

15:01.367 --> 15:04.700
My pregnant daughter-in-law
was seriously injured.

15:04.770 --> 15:07.170
But violence is never the answer.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.670
And for this reason alone,

15:09.742 --> 15:12.210
if the good people of Tree Hill
feel that I should step down,

15:13.746 --> 15:15.111
<i>then I will resign.</i>

15:15.180 --> 15:18.240
Even when I'm away in rehab,
you find a way of getting in my face.

15:18.317 --> 15:19.978
<i>No more questions.</i>

15:22.554 --> 15:26.650
Oh, goody, my afternoon pills.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.823
What happened to the sheets?

15:34.166 --> 15:36.157
- The sheets?
- The bed sheets

15:37.970 --> 15:39.733
that go on the bed.

15:41.073 --> 15:42.973
Oh, those sheets.

15:44.376 --> 15:46.469
I was wondering the same thing.

15:46.545 --> 15:48.206
About the sheets.

16:00.559 --> 16:02.083
Thanks for coming over, man.

16:02.161 --> 16:04.686
Yeah. You sounded pretty messed up
in your message.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.094
What's up?

16:06.865 --> 16:09.561
I screwed up, man. I told Haley everything.

16:09.635 --> 16:13.628
About shaving points and throwing State
and what I did to Daunte.

16:15.774 --> 16:17.503
It was me, not Dan.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.542
I'm the one that attacked Daunte.

16:20.612 --> 16:22.409
- You?
- Yeah.

16:23.949 --> 16:28.113
I need you to come with me, Lucas.
I think I'm gonna turn myself in.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.455
You haven't watched the news, have you?

16:32.057 --> 16:34.184
Nathan, you didn't kill Daunte.

16:34.259 --> 16:36.227
He died in the accident, from the impact.

16:36.295 --> 16:39.230
Dan's out of jail.
They dropped the charges.

16:39.631 --> 16:41.326
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.499
You're off the hook.

16:47.940 --> 16:51.398
It still doesn't change the fact
that I betrayed Haley.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.335
Should've seen the way
she looked at me, man.

16:54.413 --> 16:58.110
Like I'm a monster. And now she's gone.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.242
Wait, what do you mean she's gone?

17:00.319 --> 17:03.948
She's at your house.
Your mom came over and picked her up.

17:06.992 --> 17:10.553
Look, I think you did the right thing, Nate.
She's your wife.

17:10.628 --> 17:12.425
She needed to know.

17:13.565 --> 17:15.192
I'll talk to her.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.425
Hey, Luke?

17:20.005 --> 17:22.064
I'm glad you're okay, man.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.337
I'm sorry for everything.

17:29.748 --> 17:31.147
It's okay.

17:59.178 --> 18:02.238
Tell me you didn't return the key
to the Tutor Center.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.441
I did. And you're welcome.

18:04.516 --> 18:06.711
Haley will never even find out.

18:06.785 --> 18:09.754
No. I failed.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.619
And you know
what makes this so much worse?

18:11.690 --> 18:15.956
I missed an entire night of partying
because I stayed up studying.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.462
You were right, okay,
I'm not book-smart, I'm Brooke-smart,

18:18.530 --> 18:20.259
and there is a big difference.

18:20.332 --> 18:23.563
Lucky for you,
Little Miss Cute-But-Not-So-Smart,

18:24.636 --> 18:28.470
I made a copy.

19:09.281 --> 19:12.409
<i>Recent polls indicate</i>
<i>that public support for Mayor Scott</i>

19:12.484 --> 19:14.577
<i>has actually risen</i>
<i>since Scott was acquitted</i>

19:14.653 --> 19:17.383
<i>of murder charges earlier this afternoon.</i>

19:18.891 --> 19:20.381
It's perfect.

19:20.459 --> 19:23.189
You buy your way out of my sins
and your approval rating skyrockets.

19:23.262 --> 19:26.925
Son, the only approval rating
I care about is yours.

19:29.701 --> 19:32.932
I still can't believe
you went as far as you did for me.

19:34.973 --> 19:38.238
- I'd do it again if I had to.
- Thanks.

19:40.145 --> 19:42.136
It's good to see you out of the orange suit,

19:42.214 --> 19:46.241
even if you did have to pay off the coroner
to write some false report.

19:46.318 --> 19:49.287
But we both know what I did.

19:49.888 --> 19:51.116
Listen to me, Nathan.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.091
I didn't rig that report,
and you didn't kill Daunte.

19:54.159 --> 19:55.626
If you believe one thing out of my mouth,

19:55.694 --> 19:58.322
one thing for the rest of your life,
you believe this.

19:58.397 --> 20:01.264
You are not responsible
for taking that man's life.

20:02.100 --> 20:05.968
Trust me, that's not the kind of guilt
you wanna carry around.

20:11.243 --> 20:12.733
Hey, roomie.

20:13.912 --> 20:15.903
So I talked to Nathan.

20:16.648 --> 20:18.206
How you doing?

20:20.152 --> 20:23.417
Why couldn't he have
just been honest with me?

20:23.488 --> 20:25.718
My guess is he didn't wanna let you down.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.554
Well, look how great that turned out.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.390
Haley, Nathan would do anything for you.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.588
You know that, don't you?

20:34.766 --> 20:35.926
You know, he made bad choices,

20:36.001 --> 20:37.525
but you gotta know
that he made them for you.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.002
Bad choices?

20:39.071 --> 20:42.666
Luke, a bad choice is,
like, acid-wash jeans.

20:42.741 --> 20:47.110
Getting involved with a loan shark
is a life-threatening, really stupid decision.

20:47.613 --> 20:49.444
Look at me, Luke.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.683
I'm a mess, I'm hurt.

20:53.218 --> 20:55.709
He was lying to me the entire time.

20:57.055 --> 20:58.784
Daunte's a bad guy.

21:00.058 --> 21:03.516
He tried to kill Nathan,
and he almost killed you.

21:04.529 --> 21:09.364
But Nathan did what he thought
was best at the time.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.294
But he didn't kill him.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.371
I know.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.906
I've been watching the news all day.

21:18.977 --> 21:22.140
You know, this morning,
I actually felt sorry for Daunte.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.848
Why is it that it's so much easier
to forgive a stranger

21:27.919 --> 21:30.649
than it is to forgive someone you love?

21:44.102 --> 21:45.660
Got your Evite.

21:45.737 --> 21:48.103
I was hoping you would come.

21:48.173 --> 21:51.609
How could I pass up an invitation
to my own break-up?

21:52.678 --> 21:56.444
Look, Mouth, I like you. A lot.

21:58.283 --> 22:02.219
The thing is,
I'm a sophomore and you're a senior.

22:03.021 --> 22:05.615
Soon you'll be going off to college

22:06.425 --> 22:09.394
and I need to start hanging out
with kids my own age.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.760
That all makes sense, Gigi,

22:11.830 --> 22:15.197
but I still don't see
why we need to break up. I mean,

22:15.267 --> 22:17.792
can't we at least wait
until the end of the year?

22:17.869 --> 22:21.965
No, because every day
for the next few months,

22:22.040 --> 22:24.031
I'll know this will end.

22:24.543 --> 22:26.511
I can't do that, Mouth.

22:27.879 --> 22:29.244
I'm sorry.

22:35.787 --> 22:39.086
You, my friend,
are going to have the hottest cast

22:39.157 --> 22:41.819
of all of the injured people in Tree Hill.

22:41.893 --> 22:43.087
Thanks.

22:46.298 --> 22:48.732
- Hales, you okay?
- Yeah.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.495
Fine. I just...

22:52.237 --> 22:55.138
I don't wanna talk about me right now.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.438
- How are things with you and Lucas?
- Really good.

23:00.278 --> 23:03.304
Not so good.
Lately I've kind of been ducking him.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.850
Why? You guys are in,
like, that honeymoon phase.

23:05.917 --> 23:08.784
You should be all blissed-out and
having three-hour-long make-out sessions

23:08.854 --> 23:12.187
and long talks about when you first knew
you wanted to be with each other.

23:12.257 --> 23:15.818
I've been holding in my feelings
because I'm in love with him.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.589
Which makes no sense whatsoever.

23:17.662 --> 23:19.721
Well, it does to me.

23:19.798 --> 23:23.666
The last time Lucas and I kissed,
like, really kissed,

23:23.735 --> 23:26.533
he had a heart attack and he almost died.

23:27.472 --> 23:29.702
- I'm bad luck.
- Oh, shut up, you are not.

23:29.775 --> 23:30.969
Yeah, I am.

23:31.042 --> 23:36.878
Think about every person I've gotten
close to. My mom, Jake, Ellie, Derek...

23:36.948 --> 23:38.848
Where are they all now?

23:40.685 --> 23:43.415
Even my dad works
a thousand miles away.

23:44.689 --> 23:48.056
Peyton, there's one thing
that you're not considering in all of this.

23:48.126 --> 23:49.525
And what's that?

23:50.195 --> 23:52.527
None of those people are Lucas.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.503
I am so rocking in this cat suit
I could totally be a thief.

24:04.576 --> 24:07.670
Good, because a lot of kids who flunk
out of school end up working as thieves.

24:07.746 --> 24:09.145
Shut up.

24:09.214 --> 24:12.479
Okay, guys, we need two new volunteers
for movie night.

24:12.551 --> 24:15.884
And anyone with suggestions
other than <i>Forrest Hump,</i>

24:17.355 --> 24:19.118
please tell Alexa.

24:20.158 --> 24:23.093
Little late for a Clean Teen meeting,
don't you think?

24:23.161 --> 24:25.994
What else do virgins have to do at night?

25:08.373 --> 25:09.431
Deb?

25:13.879 --> 25:17.542
Look, I'm sorry, this place just isn't for me.

25:17.916 --> 25:21.682
Well, you do know
it's a voluntary program?

25:21.753 --> 25:25.154
All you have to do is sign out.

25:26.057 --> 25:28.150
Yeah. I knew that.

25:43.942 --> 25:47.002
- Hurry up.
- I am going as fast as I can.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.048
Got it. Let's get out of here.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.718
This thing doesn't have any pockets.

25:57.789 --> 26:00.553
I told you we should've worn cargo pants.

26:00.625 --> 26:03.526
Well, whoever designed this has
no concept of functional thief-wear.

26:03.595 --> 26:07.656
Well, maybe you should design a line
of clothing for criminals. Come on.

26:14.506 --> 26:17.031
Well, well, what do we have here?

26:30.589 --> 26:33.285
- Girls?
- Principal Turner.

26:33.358 --> 26:34.620
Hi.

26:35.193 --> 26:37.821
What brings you two to school so late?

26:39.831 --> 26:42.891
You know, we just stopped by for the...

26:42.968 --> 26:44.060
Clean Teen meeting?

26:44.135 --> 26:47.571
Clean Teens, please welcome
our two newest members,

26:47.639 --> 26:49.971
Brooke Davis and Rachel Gatina.

26:52.677 --> 26:57.080
Brooke, Rachel,
I'd like to present each of you with a gift.

27:00.919 --> 27:04.377
Brooke Davis, Rachel Gatina,
do you promise

27:04.456 --> 27:09.291
to treasure and protect the sacredness
of your virginity now and forever?

27:11.830 --> 27:13.320
Forever?

27:13.398 --> 27:15.696
Or at least until marriage?

27:15.767 --> 27:18.258
And do you promise to uphold
the values of Clean Teens?

27:18.336 --> 27:20.463
To stay strong in the face of temptation

27:20.538 --> 27:24.599
and to keep man parts
out of your lady business?

27:29.814 --> 27:34.012
- Can we still brooke ourselves?
- Oh, yeah, that's totally allowed.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.987
Then I do.

27:40.892 --> 27:42.291
Brooke?

27:44.796 --> 27:46.457
Just one second.

27:47.232 --> 27:49.029
We have gotta get out of here.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.796
Yeah, sure, let's just pretend
like Principal Turner didn't see us

27:51.870 --> 27:53.360
in the hallway dressed like burglars.

27:53.438 --> 27:56.202
Maybe he won't notice
when you get an A in calculus.

27:56.274 --> 27:59.471
This is our alibi. We need to lay low.

27:59.544 --> 28:02.911
Besides, these bitches are crazy.
It might be fun.

28:04.749 --> 28:05.875
Fine.

28:07.952 --> 28:10.079
Yeah, whatever, I'm in.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.681
Congratulations, ladies.

28:12.757 --> 28:16.124
I now pronounce you virgins for life.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.627
You still look like a slut.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.864
And you still smell like a whore.

28:26.938 --> 28:28.701
Oh. I almost forgot.

28:34.112 --> 28:37.513
Brooke, Rachel, welcome to Clean Teens.

28:41.686 --> 28:42.948
Hugs.

28:45.023 --> 28:46.388
Put them on.

28:51.262 --> 28:52.593
This is crazy.

28:52.664 --> 28:55.497
I don't want to break up with Gigi,
we're good together.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.296
I mean, who cares if I'm going to college?

28:57.368 --> 29:01.099
People have long-distance relationships
all the time. Right?

29:01.639 --> 29:03.766
Well, I think if your heart's telling you
to make it work,

29:03.842 --> 29:05.707
- then you gotta make it work.
- No...

29:05.777 --> 29:08.803
Pay no attention to the man who's never
been in a long-distance relationship.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.780
Trust me, distance is tricky.

29:10.849 --> 29:13.249
- What's so tricky about it?
- Out of sight, out of mind.

29:13.318 --> 29:14.683
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.313
Physical separation leads
to emotional separation.

29:17.388 --> 29:19.253
- Yeah, and technology closes that gap.
- Guys.

29:19.324 --> 29:21.884
- Technology...
- Guys, this isn't helping.

29:24.829 --> 29:28.196
I'm just gonna have to figure this one out
on my own.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.701
Hey, Mouth,
you remember when you asked me

29:31.770 --> 29:34.136
if we'd have been better off
if we never left the River Court?

29:34.205 --> 29:37.140
- Yeah, what about it?
- You still think that?

29:38.076 --> 29:40.840
I think it would have been
better for Jimmy.

29:40.912 --> 29:42.937
You think about him much?

29:43.681 --> 29:46.172
All the time. You?

29:48.486 --> 29:50.044
Lately, yeah.

30:00.565 --> 30:01.725
Haley?

30:08.606 --> 30:10.665
Mom, what are you doing out of rehab?

30:10.742 --> 30:14.337
Exactly what it looks like,
and I'm not proud of myself.

30:16.848 --> 30:19.612
You're not gonna find anything in there.

30:20.251 --> 30:22.151
You're right, I'm sorry.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.745
I'm a disappointment to you, Nathan.

30:25.123 --> 30:28.183
I shouldn't let you see me like this.

30:28.259 --> 30:29.385
Mom.

30:32.931 --> 30:34.523
Haley left me.

30:37.101 --> 30:38.534
Oh, God.

30:40.004 --> 30:42.598
I'm the last person
who should be giving advice.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.438
But even in my drugged-up stupor,

30:45.510 --> 30:49.310
I can see that what you and Haley have
is worth fighting for.

30:59.824 --> 31:01.086
You busy?

31:01.960 --> 31:03.894
No, just faking it.

31:04.796 --> 31:07.287
Sorry I was being a weirdo earlier.

31:07.999 --> 31:09.728
You mean
when you didn't kiss me on the quad,

31:09.801 --> 31:13.066
or when you said,
"Dreams are e-mail for ghosts"?

31:14.839 --> 31:15.931
Both.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.872
What's wrong, Peyton?

31:20.278 --> 31:22.712
I wanna kiss you, Luke, I do.

31:23.248 --> 31:26.649
- I just don't wanna lose you.
- Hey,

31:27.352 --> 31:29.115
what makes you think
you're gonna lose me?

31:29.187 --> 31:32.281
Only the fact
that I lose everyone I care about.

31:32.891 --> 31:37.294
Any time I open up to someone,
they walk out of my life or they die

31:37.362 --> 31:39.193
or they move away
or they get shipped off to Iraq

31:39.264 --> 31:41.789
or they turn into
freaking Norman Bates or...

31:49.440 --> 31:50.907
Not everyone.

31:52.543 --> 31:54.943
Look, the last time we kissed,
you had a heart attack.

31:55.013 --> 31:58.210
And I didn't die. I couldn't die.

31:59.183 --> 32:00.810
Do you know why?

32:01.653 --> 32:05.817
Because I had to come back
and look into those green eyes of yours

32:07.358 --> 32:09.349
and tell you I love you.

32:10.295 --> 32:11.421
I do.

32:12.397 --> 32:14.126
I love you, Peyton.

32:17.001 --> 32:18.969
You didn't push me away.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.538
I came back for you.

32:21.606 --> 32:25.042
And no matter how long it takes,
I'll wait for you.

32:35.186 --> 32:37.814
- Nathan.
- I need to see my wife.

32:40.391 --> 32:44.122
Haley, we can't be apart like this.
We need to be together.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.461
Always and forever.

32:58.109 --> 33:00.475
I'll leave the two of you alone.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.316
I'm sorry, okay?

33:09.387 --> 33:11.821
I never wanted to hurt you.

33:11.889 --> 33:13.948
And I'm sorry for all the ways that I did.

33:14.025 --> 33:17.358
I know you're sorry.
I know you don't wanna hurt me.

33:18.129 --> 33:20.757
But I need to know
that you're gonna be honest with me.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.026
- I promise...
- I need to know

33:22.100 --> 33:23.795
that you're gonna let me in, Nathan.

33:23.868 --> 33:25.631
I mean, all the way.

33:27.772 --> 33:29.967
I will, okay?

33:30.041 --> 33:32.635
I'll let you in, if that's what it takes,
I'll let you in.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.041
It's just

33:35.013 --> 33:39.074
sometimes I'm afraid that if I do,
you'll see the real me,

33:39.150 --> 33:41.175
the guy I was before you.

33:41.519 --> 33:45.353
I'm not proud of that person, okay?
The one that I used to be.

33:46.090 --> 33:49.025
But if I have to be that guy
to keep you safe,

33:49.093 --> 33:51.288
then that's who I'm gonna be.

33:53.431 --> 33:56.400
Look, if you want me to apologize
for defending you

33:56.467 --> 33:58.128
or for fighting back
when somebody hurts you,

33:58.202 --> 33:59.567
then I can't do that.

33:59.637 --> 34:00.626
I won't do that, okay?

34:00.705 --> 34:04.106
Because the truth is,
that's a guy I'll never be.

34:04.175 --> 34:08.043
A guy that just stands by
and watches while the world hurts you.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.072
Can you understand that?

34:12.917 --> 34:14.714
- I can't.
- Haley, you have to...

34:14.786 --> 34:17.482
No, I can't keep standing on one foot.

34:18.356 --> 34:20.551
So if there's more, I should sit down,

34:20.625 --> 34:23.594
but if you're done, then just take me home

34:23.661 --> 34:27.222
'cause I'm tired and I miss you
and I love you, every version of you.

34:27.297 --> 34:28.764
Come here.

34:51.889 --> 34:53.014
Dan?

34:58.863 --> 35:01.024
What is wrong with people?

35:01.766 --> 35:03.927
Who would come into your house
and do this?

35:09.107 --> 35:12.440
They must've done it before they knew
your charges were dropped.

35:12.510 --> 35:16.674
I assure you, Karen, I had
absolutely nothing to do with my release.

35:17.682 --> 35:19.775
It was Nathan, wasn't it?

35:24.822 --> 35:25.948
I saw his hand.

35:26.023 --> 35:27.615
Daunte was already dead, Karen.

35:27.692 --> 35:30.286
Yeah, but you didn't know that then.

35:30.728 --> 35:32.059
And you still took the blame.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.928
I had to protect my son. I had no choice.

35:35.800 --> 35:39.395
You're a mother, Karen,
you would've done the same thing.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.735
What's this for?

35:53.217 --> 35:55.981
I thought I saw someone I used to know.

36:03.361 --> 36:06.694
I took your advice
and I told Peyton how I felt.

36:08.065 --> 36:11.865
I gotta tell you something, you were right.

36:13.070 --> 36:15.061
It felt good to tell her.

36:34.992 --> 36:36.584
Thanks, Keith.

36:38.062 --> 36:40.860
<i>Have you ever had a dream</i>
<i>that seemed so real,</i>

36:40.932 --> 36:44.163
<i>when you woke up,</i>
<i>you didn't know what to believe?</i>

36:55.580 --> 36:59.311
<i>What would you do</i>
<i>if what you thought was true, wasn't?</i>

37:07.325 --> 37:10.317
<i>And what you thought wasn't true, was?</i>

37:13.297 --> 37:15.822
Thank you for telling me the truth.

37:16.367 --> 37:19.063
Now I know why they call it true love.

37:24.675 --> 37:26.336
<i>Would you retreat into your dreams</i>

37:26.410 --> 37:28.901
<i>with the hope of finding</i>
<i>a more perfect reality?</i>

37:28.980 --> 37:30.345
We can make this work.

37:30.414 --> 37:33.679
I'll come home on the weekends,
we'll talk on the phone.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.912
Gigi, we can make this work.

37:51.435 --> 37:54.871
Look at it this way.
Yesterday you were a slut with an F.

37:54.939 --> 37:58.238
Today you have an A in math
and your virginity back.

37:58.309 --> 38:00.539
- You should be psyched.
- Yeah.

38:01.245 --> 38:04.112
Brooke, Rachel. Over here.

38:11.689 --> 38:15.352
<i>Sometimes, life is stranger than a dream.</i>

38:21.932 --> 38:24.093
<i>And the only way to wake up</i>

38:25.436 --> 38:28.269
<i>is to face what lies hidden in your soul.</i>

38:35.413 --> 38:38.109
I still don't believe
that Jimmy killed you, Keith.

38:38.182 --> 38:40.343
Well, then, why do you?

38:40.418 --> 38:42.511
Jimmy Edwards was your friend, Luke.

38:42.586 --> 38:45.282
You knew him. You were kind to him.

38:45.356 --> 38:46.550
After everything we've seen,

38:46.624 --> 38:50.390
don't you think that
that kindness had an impact?

38:50.461 --> 38:52.452
But if it did, then you would still be alive.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.498
Do you really believe that, Luke?

38:54.565 --> 38:57.363
Look, look into your heart, okay?

38:57.435 --> 39:00.063
It may be flawed physically,
but it's a good one.

39:00.137 --> 39:02.401
And it's what makes you, you.

39:02.473 --> 39:06.068
Luke, you've changed other people's lives
by opening it up.

39:06.143 --> 39:07.974
Don't close that off.

39:09.880 --> 39:13.782
<i>And you can only hope</i>
<i>that in those moments of dark reflection</i>

39:18.823 --> 39:20.757
<i>that you are not alone.</i>

39:26.897 --> 39:29.457
Hey. I've been waiting for you.

39:30.167 --> 39:32.567
I think we've waited long enough.
