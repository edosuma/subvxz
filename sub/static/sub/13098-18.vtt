[instrumental music]

00:07.750 --> 00:10.833
[indistinct announcement on PA]

00:19.333 --> 00:20.958
Excuse me.
Perhaps you might help me.

00:21.042 --> 00:22.458
I'm looking
for Ambassador Delenn.

00:22.542 --> 00:24.083
Could you tell me
where I might find her?

00:24.167 --> 00:26.375
Of course. This way.

00:29.792 --> 00:31.917
(Ivanova)
'Shuttle 1 is ready to go,
commander.'

00:32.000 --> 00:33.917
Any change
in those seismic disturbances?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.667
The surface layer's calmed down,
but we're still

00:35.750 --> 00:37.458
picking up rumbles
from further down.

00:37.542 --> 00:40.042
Normally, I wouldn't bother, but
we're in orbit over this thing.

00:40.125 --> 00:42.583
Alright. Best to check it out
just to be sure.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.000
Agreed.

00:46.042 --> 00:48.333
Shuttle 1, you're clear
to begin geological survey.

00:48.417 --> 00:49.708
(Tasaki)
'Confirmed, Babylon Control.
Initiating launch.'

00:49.792 --> 00:52.833
[intense music]

00:56.292 --> 00:57.917
I have to go play diplomat
for a few hours.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.917
Let me know
when the survey team comes back.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.292
Will do.

01:02.792 --> 01:05.875
[spacecraft droning]

01:13.125 --> 01:14.333
[sighs]

01:16.125 --> 01:17.625
Ms. Winters.

01:17.708 --> 01:19.625
Hello, commander.

01:19.708 --> 01:21.417
Problem with the transport tube?

01:21.500 --> 01:23.167
No, not really.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.667
It seems like
every time I get into the tube

01:25.750 --> 01:28.458
Mr. Garibaldi's there.
It's like he knows.

01:28.542 --> 01:31.042
Talia,
Mr. Garibaldi is many things

01:31.125 --> 01:32.875
but he's not omniscient.

01:41.417 --> 01:43.542
I think I'll take the stairs.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.333
I think I'll join you.

01:45.417 --> 01:48.458
[instrumental music]

01:50.542 --> 01:53.208
Range to surface, 40 miles.

01:55.042 --> 01:56.167
Close enough.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.000
Activate scanners

01:58.083 --> 01:59.958
set for maximum depth.

02:00.042 --> 02:02.625
Let's see what's going on
under all that dirt.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.500
[intense music]

02:07.792 --> 02:09.917
- Ah!
- What the hell was that?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
We lost power. Get it back.

02:11.083 --> 02:13.458
I can't,
I have no controls here!

02:14.625 --> 02:17.667
[music continues]

02:20.750 --> 02:24.333
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

02:24.417 --> 02:27.542
ten years
after the Earth-Minbari War.

02:27.625 --> 02:31.042
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

02:31.125 --> 02:33.042
Its goal,
to prevent another war

02:33.125 --> 02:35.792
by creating a place
where humans and aliens

02:35.875 --> 02:38.292
could work out
their differences peacefully.

02:38.375 --> 02:41.375
It's a port of call,
home away from home

02:41.458 --> 02:43.333
for diplomats, hustlers

02:43.417 --> 02:46.375
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.250
Humans and aliens wrapped

02:48.333 --> 02:50.958
in 2,500,000 tons

02:51.042 --> 02:52.917
of spinning metal

02:53.000 --> 02:55.167
all alone in the night.

02:56.417 --> 02:58.458
It can be a dangerous place

02:58.542 --> 03:01.625
but it's our last best hope
for peace.

03:01.708 --> 03:05.667
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.917
The year is 2258.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.958
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:12.042 --> 03:15.083
[theme music]

03:44.250 --> 03:47.333
[music continues]

03:50.208 --> 03:51.625
[intense music]

03:51.708 --> 03:53.875
(Ivanova)
'Babylon Control to Shuttle 1.'

03:53.958 --> 03:57.125
- Shuttle 1, do you receive?
- 'Confirmed, Babylon control.'

03:57.208 --> 03:59.167
- 'We're receiving you.'
- What the hell was it?

03:59.250 --> 04:00.958
All of our readouts
blacked out for a second.

04:01.042 --> 04:02.958
(Tasaki)
'Same here, Babylon Control.'

04:03.042 --> 04:05.958
It was some kind
of massive power surge

04:06.042 --> 04:07.125
right off the scale.

04:07.208 --> 04:09.250
Knocked
half our systems offline.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.667
It must have come from somewhere
deep inside the planet.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.042
What's your situation?

04:13.125 --> 04:14.708
'Shuttle controls
are partly fried.'

04:14.792 --> 04:16.250
We've managed to achieve
a low-grade orbit

04:16.333 --> 04:18.333
but we can't make it back
unassisted.

04:18.417 --> 04:20.542
Can you send someone out here
to give us a lift?

04:20.625 --> 04:22.833
Confirmed.
We'll send two Starfuries ASAP.

04:22.917 --> 04:25.000
Stand by. Don't go anywhere.

04:25.083 --> 04:28.542
Don't go anywhere?
As if we could.

04:28.625 --> 04:31.333
Okay, we've got a while to wait.

04:31.417 --> 04:32.958
Who's got a deck of cards?

04:33.917 --> 04:36.958
[spacecraft droning]

04:39.000 --> 04:42.042
[intense music]

04:47.417 --> 04:49.333
- You're sure they're alright?
- 'They're a little shaken.'

04:49.417 --> 04:52.042
(Ivanova)
'But otherwise fine. They'll be
back onboard in a few hours.'

04:52.125 --> 04:53.542
[sighs]
Good. Keep me informed.

04:53.625 --> 04:56.500
And find out
what's going on down there.

04:56.583 --> 04:58.708
- Sorry.
- It's quite alright.

04:58.792 --> 05:00.875
An interesting riddle,
commander.

05:00.958 --> 05:03.250
I thought the planet beneath us
was uninhabited.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.542
That's what we thought,
none of our prior surveys

05:05.625 --> 05:07.167
found any signs of life
down there.

05:07.250 --> 05:09.292
Perhaps not now, but in the past

05:09.375 --> 05:11.708
someone or something
might have lived down there.

05:11.792 --> 05:15.708
If that's true, it would seem
you may have awakened something.

05:15.792 --> 05:18.458
Perhaps. We'll know more later.

05:18.542 --> 05:23.042
Now, as far as these
new trade routes are concerned..

05:25.125 --> 05:27.458
(male #1)
'Babylon Control,
this is Delta Leader.'

05:27.542 --> 05:29.375
'We have retrieved
shuttle crew from planet'

05:29.458 --> 05:32.542
'and are returning
to Cobra Bay for recharge.'

05:32.625 --> 05:35.042
[crackling]

05:35.125 --> 05:36.833
And I want
every piece of equipment we have

05:36.917 --> 05:38.958
loaded on to the shuttle,
spectral analysis

05:39.042 --> 05:40.167
thermal probes, the works.

05:40.250 --> 05:41.417
We'll reconvene
tomorrow morning.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.917
- 8:00 sharp.
- Yes, sir.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.375
(Ivanova)
'Dr. Tasaki!'

05:44.458 --> 05:46.000
Lieutenant commander.

05:46.083 --> 05:48.000
- What was that?
- I have no idea.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.583
We were told
that the planet we're orbiting

05:49.667 --> 05:51.625
is stable, safe and uninhabited.

05:51.708 --> 05:53.125
Now it appears to be
none of those things.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.208
Incorrect,
we still don't know for sure

05:55.292 --> 05:57.167
if anyone's
actually alive down there.

05:57.250 --> 05:58.750
The seismic activity
planet-side

05:58.833 --> 06:01.375
could've triggered an automatic
system of some kind.

06:01.458 --> 06:02.875
We'll know more
once we go back down.

06:02.958 --> 06:05.083
Well, w-what are you
going to do now?

06:05.167 --> 06:08.583
In order, process the data we
collected from the power burst

06:08.667 --> 06:11.417
then call my wife in Plasma.
She loves mysteries.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.917
This doesn't worry you
in the slightest?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.083
On the contrary,
it scares the hell out of me.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.833
But what better way to go out

06:17.917 --> 06:20.708
than in the cause of advancing
scientific knowledge?

06:22.583 --> 06:24.625
Is this
a multiple-choice question?

06:24.708 --> 06:26.583
Because I have some ideas.

06:26.667 --> 06:30.292
And we will agree to release
our trade routes to Sector 119

06:30.375 --> 06:32.167
provided that our ships
in that area

06:32.250 --> 06:35.333
are allowed free use
of the local Centauri jumpgate.

06:35.417 --> 06:37.208
You drive a very hard bargain.

06:37.292 --> 06:40.167
It's a fair deal, ambassador,
your government stands to profit

06:40.250 --> 06:42.042
substantially
from access to that sector.

06:42.125 --> 06:44.958
The jumpgate fees
are pocket change by comparison.

06:45.042 --> 06:46.667
Obviously,
what I consider a tent

06:46.750 --> 06:48.875
you consider a pocket.

06:48.958 --> 06:53.167
But you are right.
It is a reasonable demand.

06:53.250 --> 06:54.625
Done and done.

06:54.708 --> 06:57.625
I will have my government
issue an agreement by

06:57.708 --> 07:00.667
when, tomorrow this time?

07:00.750 --> 07:03.958
What a pleasure it is to deal
with someone reasonable.

07:04.042 --> 07:05.958
Negotiations
are so much more enjoyable

07:06.042 --> 07:09.000
when certain individuals
are not here to interfere.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.875
I would suggest
that there is a difference

07:10.958 --> 07:14.750
between being unreasonable
and being angry.

07:14.833 --> 07:17.167
Ambassador G'Kar is angry
much of the time

07:17.250 --> 07:20.917
but even the greatest anger
fades with time.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.708
My dear Ambassador Delenn

07:22.792 --> 07:25.875
I am sure
that for you this is true.

07:25.958 --> 07:27.292
But for G'Kar and his people

07:27.375 --> 07:29.792
they will do all that they can
to destroy us

07:29.875 --> 07:33.667
until the universe itself
decays and collapses.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.500
If the Narns
all stood together in one place

07:36.583 --> 07:38.500
and hated all at the same time

07:38.583 --> 07:42.042
that hatred could fly across
dozens of light years

07:42.125 --> 07:46.042
and reduce Centauri Prime
to a ball of ash.

07:46.125 --> 07:47.833
That's how much they hate us.

07:47.917 --> 07:49.833
You don't have
to respond in kind.

07:49.917 --> 07:53.292
Of course we do.
It is a natural law.

07:53.375 --> 07:55.708
Physics tells us
that for every action

07:55.792 --> 07:58.917
there must be
an equal and opposite reaction.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.542
They hate us, we hate them,
they hate us back.

08:02.625 --> 08:05.208
And so here we are

08:05.292 --> 08:07.792
victims of mathematics.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.167
Ambassador.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.750
[sighs]
He never listens.

08:15.833 --> 08:18.833
He will, sooner or later.

08:18.917 --> 08:20.250
How can you be sure?

08:20.333 --> 08:24.500
Because the alternative
is too terrible to consider.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.917
Without the hope
that things will get better

08:27.000 --> 08:28.750
that our inheritors
will know a world

08:28.833 --> 08:31.208
that is fuller and richer
than our own..

08:31.958 --> 08:33.750
...life is pointless.

08:33.833 --> 08:36.625
And evolution
is vastly overrated.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.167
Good day, commander.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.708
(Ivanova)
'The signal seems
to have diminished a little.'

08:44.792 --> 08:47.250
- 'In the past few hours.'
- 'Are you sure it's a beacon?'

08:47.333 --> 08:48.917
(Ivanova)
'Well, once our instruments
came back online'

08:49.000 --> 08:50.458
we were able to run a few tests.

08:50.542 --> 08:52.542
It's definitely
a series of regular signals

08:52.625 --> 08:54.250
repeated at specific intervals.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.250
But so far we haven't been able
to decipher them.

08:57.333 --> 08:58.792
How's Dr. Tasaki?

08:58.875 --> 09:00.333
He's like a kid
with a new puzzle.

09:00.417 --> 09:01.667
He wants to go back down
and check it out

09:01.750 --> 09:02.792
first thing tomorrow morning.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.875
A glutton for punishment.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.292
Alright, I'll authorize it

09:06.375 --> 09:08.125
but only on the condition
that we can find some way

09:08.208 --> 09:09.292
to get him down there safely.

09:09.375 --> 09:10.333
Agreed, I'll take care of that

09:10.417 --> 09:12.917
first thing tomorrow morning.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.667
Oh, by the way, commander.

09:14.750 --> 09:15.917
Have you heard any news today?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.625
- From the Mars Colony?
- No. Why?

09:17.708 --> 09:19.250
Well, there's always something
about it in the daily

09:19.333 --> 09:21.625
"Earthforce" status report,
but it just came in

09:21.708 --> 09:24.375
and there wasn't any word
from Mars. Nothing.

09:24.458 --> 09:26.625
Now, usually that's a sign of
their running military exercises

09:26.708 --> 09:28.750
but we would have gotten
some warning about that.

09:28.833 --> 09:30.750
Probably just a glitch
in the system.

09:30.833 --> 09:32.125
Goodnight, lieutenant commander.

09:32.208 --> 09:33.625
Goodnight, commander.

09:45.125 --> 09:46.583
[door whirring]

09:46.667 --> 09:49.250
Quickly. What is the third
principle of sentient life?

09:49.333 --> 09:51.792
- Draal.
- Incorrect answer.

09:51.875 --> 09:53.417
The third principle
of sentient life

09:53.500 --> 09:55.375
is the capacity
for self-sacrifice.

09:55.458 --> 09:56.833
The conscious ability

09:56.917 --> 09:58.000
to override evolution

09:58.083 --> 09:59.542
and self-preservation

09:59.625 --> 10:00.625
for a cause

10:00.708 --> 10:03.333
a friend, a loved one.

10:03.417 --> 10:06.000
It has been too long, Delenn.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.083
You have forgotten
your training.

10:08.167 --> 10:09.500
Soon you will have forgotten

10:09.583 --> 10:12.542
all about your old friend Draal.

10:12.625 --> 10:15.167
Not if I live to be a 1001.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.375
[chuckles]

10:20.833 --> 10:22.250
Well then why would you
keep your good friend

10:22.333 --> 10:24.375
standing out here
in this drafty hall

10:24.458 --> 10:26.875
instead of
in your warm quarters?

10:27.625 --> 10:28.667
[chuckles]

10:30.417 --> 10:33.917
(male #2)
'Tanker 12, are you in position
to refuel our turn transport?'

10:34.000 --> 10:37.250
(male #3)
'Uh, Roger, C &amp; C, our hose
jockey is ready to connect.'

10:42.375 --> 10:43.833
(woman on TV)
'With new questions
being raised'

10:43.917 --> 10:45.375
'about the cost of maintaining'

10:45.458 --> 10:46.958
'a presence in space'

10:47.042 --> 10:47.958
'Senator Paul Quat'

10:48.042 --> 10:49.500
'of the Indonesian Consortium'

10:49.583 --> 10:52.833
upon leaving an Earthdome
hearing on new programs

10:52.917 --> 10:54.292
asked why less affluent nations

10:54.375 --> 10:56.333
should be asked to pay
an equal share of the cost

10:56.417 --> 10:59.167
if they do not receive
an equal share of the benefits.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.208
Elsewhere in the news..

11:01.292 --> 11:03.542
We-we're just getting
a late breaking story.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.542
As-as ISN viewers may know

11:05.625 --> 11:07.875
all contact with the Mars Colony
has been cut off

11:08.000 --> 11:10.375
'since noon today
Earth Standard Time.'

11:10.458 --> 11:11.917
'We're now receiving
confirmation'

11:12.000 --> 11:13.667
that an open revolt
is in progress

11:13.750 --> 11:16.083
against the Earth-appointed
provisional government.

11:16.167 --> 11:18.667
We're receiving reports
of heavy fighting

11:18.750 --> 11:20.042
'outside the capital city'

11:20.125 --> 11:22.583
'and armed skirmishes
within the city itself.'

11:22.667 --> 11:25.250
'Troops have an order
from bases in Syria Planum'

11:25.333 --> 11:28.750
to reinforce patrols in Solis
Planum and outlying regions.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.625
I'm told we have a live feed

11:30.708 --> 11:33.000
from ISN reporter,
Derek Mobotabwe

11:33.083 --> 11:35.958
relayed from our station
on Olympus Mons

11:36.042 --> 11:37.875
reporting
substantial casualties

11:37.958 --> 11:39.417
from the continued fighting.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.792
Death toll may be
in the hundreds or higher.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.417
The insurgents struck
before dawn

11:44.500 --> 11:47.625
with heavy weapons seized
in a daring midnight raid

11:47.708 --> 11:49.708
on a reserve military base.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.708
The guerillas,
whose ancestors migrated

11:51.792 --> 11:54.458
to Mars from Earth
over the past 100 years

11:54.542 --> 11:56.917
'have demanded independence
for the Mars Colony'

11:57.000 --> 11:58.458
'or and I quote'

11:58.542 --> 12:01.708
"The sand will run red
with Earther blood."

12:01.792 --> 12:03.708
Provincial Governor Chakan
said..

12:08.417 --> 12:10.958
(male #4)
'Help me.'

12:17.833 --> 12:19.875
Help me.

12:25.375 --> 12:28.417
[intense music]

12:31.083 --> 12:32.958
(female #1)
'Venus Team 2,
this is Environmental Control.'

12:33.042 --> 12:34.958
'Bring that convertor around
to Tower 3.'

12:35.042 --> 12:36.667
(male #5)
'Got you,
Environmental Control.'

12:36.750 --> 12:38.167
'We're on our way.'

12:47.542 --> 12:50.958
Commander. I take it you heard
the news from Mars last night.

12:51.042 --> 12:53.083
I did, terrible to see places

12:53.167 --> 12:54.792
where I grew up
going up in flames.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.833
That's right,
you were born on Mars.

12:56.917 --> 12:58.333
Do you still have
family or friends there?

12:58.417 --> 13:01.167
- No, thank God. You?
- No, not anymore.

13:02.375 --> 13:03.875
Garibaldi's taking it
pretty hard.

13:03.958 --> 13:08.333
Yeah, I figured as much.
I'll try to check on him later.

13:08.417 --> 13:11.458
- You alright, commander?
- I don't know.

13:11.542 --> 13:14.375
Last night just before
I went to bed, I saw a..

13:15.792 --> 13:16.875
What?

13:16.958 --> 13:18.667
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just tired.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.625
What's the status on Epsilon 3?

13:20.708 --> 13:22.708
The geology team
leaves in a few hours.

13:22.792 --> 13:25.208
Good. Keep me informed.

13:25.292 --> 13:28.333
[intense music]

13:33.792 --> 13:34.875
Damn.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.042
[exhales sharply]

13:38.125 --> 13:41.208
[instrumental music]

13:44.833 --> 13:46.583
Have I already thanked you

13:46.667 --> 13:48.833
for arranging for my quarters
last night

13:48.917 --> 13:51.458
and for the fine meal
this morning?

13:51.542 --> 13:54.375
- Yes, you have.
- Good.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.333
Then I need not do so again.

13:57.417 --> 13:59.417
Have I told you about Rathenn?

13:59.500 --> 14:01.917
Yes, you have told me
of Rathenn

14:02.000 --> 14:05.250
of all of my teachers
and many of my family.

14:05.333 --> 14:09.000
You have told me everything,
except why you're here.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.417
What is there to tell?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.792
I have lived my entire life
on Minbar.

14:13.875 --> 14:16.458
Now I am seeing
what is out here.

14:16.542 --> 14:18.167
Yes.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.000
A curious answer
from one who taught me

14:20.083 --> 14:23.792
that a half-truth
is the worst kind of lie.

14:27.375 --> 14:29.792
Our world is changing, Delenn.

14:31.167 --> 14:33.500
I'm not sure
when it began to change.

14:33.583 --> 14:37.250
Perhaps the war,
perhaps the death of Dukhat.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.958
Perhaps the darkness was there
all along

14:41.042 --> 14:43.125
and we refused to see it.

14:43.208 --> 14:44.917
If you're referring
to the growing division

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
between the religious
and military castes--

14:47.083 --> 14:49.833
That, and more than that.

14:49.917 --> 14:54.375
There is a sense
that we are lost, drifting.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.708
In the streets, in the temples

14:55.792 --> 14:59.625
you can hear it in their voices,
their manner.

14:59.708 --> 15:01.417
An anger
just beneath the surface

15:01.500 --> 15:03.292
a growing dissatisfaction

15:03.375 --> 15:06.458
a self-involvement

15:06.542 --> 15:08.667
above the needs of others.

15:08.750 --> 15:12.250
'It is not the same world
in which I was born, Delenn.'

15:12.333 --> 15:14.667
Not the same world at all.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.750
I am going to the sea.

15:22.125 --> 15:25.375
Draal...no.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.167
You're still too young
to go to the sea.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.542
There's so much you could do
back home.

15:30.625 --> 15:34.458
I don't know what good
it would do.

15:34.542 --> 15:38.000
Better to find a place out there
in the sea of stars

15:38.083 --> 15:42.583
where I can be of service
before the end.

15:42.667 --> 15:46.125
I hear the call of the stars,
Delenn

15:46.208 --> 15:48.083
and I must answer.

15:49.250 --> 15:52.417
Then, when you leave here..

15:54.750 --> 15:57.000
...I will never see you again.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.042
I'm afraid so.

16:01.583 --> 16:03.458
Which is why we should enjoy

16:03.542 --> 16:06.167
our time together, Delenn.

16:07.042 --> 16:09.833
Don't look so sad.

16:09.917 --> 16:12.417
This should be a time
of great joy.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.542
My feet are firmly on the path

16:14.625 --> 16:17.625
and the road beckons me
down to the sea.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.667
'There I will find the purpose'

16:20.750 --> 16:23.167
and meaning that I have lost

16:23.250 --> 16:25.375
among my own people.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.792
Be glad, Delenn.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.042
Be glad.

16:31.708 --> 16:32.958
When..

16:34.583 --> 16:36.292
When do you have to leave?

16:37.250 --> 16:38.667
Not for a while.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.458
We have time.

16:43.250 --> 16:47.125
We have seen very little of
one another these last few years

16:47.208 --> 16:49.750
and there is much
that I want to hear.

16:53.667 --> 16:56.250
Then I will talk
and talk and talk

16:56.333 --> 16:58.500
until you fall asleep
from the sound.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.958
[laughing]

17:01.917 --> 17:04.042
And I will be glad of it.

17:06.458 --> 17:09.333
And I will dream of the sea.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.750
What the hell do you mean
you can't get a signal

17:15.833 --> 17:16.917
through the Mars Colony?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.792
I'm sorry,
communications are out

17:18.875 --> 17:20.708
except for authorized personnel.

17:20.792 --> 17:22.083
Let me get this straight.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.667
I'm an Earthforce
security officer

17:23.750 --> 17:25.375
clearance level
ultraviolet-alpha

17:25.458 --> 17:27.375
and I'm not considered
authorized personnel?

17:27.458 --> 17:28.750
lf you try again later--

17:28.833 --> 17:30.708
I've been trying
all damn morning!

17:30.792 --> 17:34.458
Now, all I'm asking for
is one clear channel.

17:34.542 --> 17:36.625
I'm sorry, Mr. Garibaldi

17:36.708 --> 17:39.000
but there is nothing we can do
until the government decides

17:39.083 --> 17:40.917
to lift
the communications blackout.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.375
I'll file your request

17:42.458 --> 17:45.250
and if things change,
I'll notify you at once.

17:47.208 --> 17:50.250
[intense music]

18:03.333 --> 18:04.750
Now, we'll be providing
fighter support

18:04.833 --> 18:06.667
in case you run into any trouble
while you're down there.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.083
But I don't want you
taking any unnecessary chances.

18:09.167 --> 18:10.542
- We won't.
- Just get your readings.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.333
Make a low-altitude scan
of the surface

18:12.417 --> 18:13.750
and get out in one piece.

18:13.833 --> 18:15.500
We'll be monitoring
your progress from C &amp; C.

18:15.583 --> 18:18.042
Good. I work best
with an audience. Anything else?

18:18.125 --> 18:21.667
Just one thing, the Starfuries
are designed for combat in space

18:21.750 --> 18:23.083
not inside an atmosphere.

18:23.167 --> 18:25.208
Don't drop too low,
or you're on your own.

18:25.292 --> 18:26.667
Understood.

18:26.750 --> 18:28.042
Alright, move it out.

18:28.125 --> 18:30.125
We've got a mystery to solve.

18:31.958 --> 18:34.167
- Ivanova to Sinclair.
- 'Sinclair.'

18:34.250 --> 18:35.833
They're on their way.
I'll meet you in Control.

18:35.917 --> 18:38.458
I'll be there. If you'll
excuse me, ambassador--

18:38.542 --> 18:40.167
Yes, yes, I know.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.667
Commander, what will you do

18:41.750 --> 18:43.833
if you find anything of value
down there?

18:43.917 --> 18:45.500
Hm, the odds of that
are pretty small.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.208
It's probably
just an automated homing beacon

18:47.292 --> 18:48.833
left over
from hundreds of years ago.

18:48.917 --> 18:51.917
Yes, but if it isn't,
will you tell me?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.417
- No.
- Hm.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.917
Just making sure
we know where we stand.

18:59.542 --> 19:01.958
(Ivanova)
'Survey 1, you will hold
at coordinates 7 by 13'

19:02.042 --> 19:03.625
'and await
arrival of escort wing.'

19:03.708 --> 19:05.667
Escort wing standing by.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.292
Launch fighter escort.

19:08.792 --> 19:11.792
[whirring]

19:13.083 --> 19:15.208
(male #1)
'Delta 6, this is Delta Leader.'

19:15.292 --> 19:16.917
'Let's be awake out there.'

19:17.000 --> 19:19.583
(male #6)
'Roger that, Delta Leader,
I'm on his tail.'

19:20.292 --> 19:22.792
[whirring]

19:24.125 --> 19:25.750
I appreciate the commission,
gentlemen.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.208
- Thank you.
- See you next month.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.875
See you then. Thank you.

19:30.708 --> 19:32.250
- I need to talk to you.
- What's wrong?

19:32.333 --> 19:34.750
- Transport tube out of order?
- Wait!

19:34.833 --> 19:36.917
Look, I'm sorry.
But I need your help.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.917
As lines go, Mr. Garibaldi,
that's not terribly original.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.083
No, it's not a line,
damn it, I..

19:42.167 --> 19:45.208
[sighs]
Can I just have five minutes?

19:45.292 --> 19:46.542
Please?

19:47.333 --> 19:48.417
Okay.

19:49.792 --> 19:51.208
Look, I appreciate
you taking the time.

19:51.292 --> 19:53.625
This is really important to me.

19:53.708 --> 19:55.583
See, before I came to Babylon 5,
my last job

19:55.667 --> 19:57.500
was working security
on the Mars Colony.

19:57.583 --> 19:59.917
I was there for about a year,
the job wasn't great

20:00.000 --> 20:01.458
we got nothing but flak
from Earthdome

20:01.542 --> 20:04.667
but one thing made it
worth all the grief.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.083
Her name's Lise Hampton.

20:08.167 --> 20:10.792
We met a few days
after I got there and we..

20:11.583 --> 20:12.583
...got involved.

20:12.667 --> 20:14.500
- Sounds serious.
- It was.

20:14.583 --> 20:17.125
We even talked about marriage
a few times.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.167
But I was..

20:20.208 --> 20:22.167
Uh, look, I was messed up.

20:22.250 --> 20:23.917
After being fired
from my last four jobs

20:24.000 --> 20:26.083
I kind of figured
I had something to prove.

20:26.167 --> 20:28.083
So when Jeff asked me
to come work Babylon 5

20:28.167 --> 20:30.167
I asked her to come with me.

20:30.250 --> 20:31.708
But she said no.

20:33.208 --> 20:35.458
We argued, I got hot,
I said a lot of stupid things

20:35.542 --> 20:37.083
the kind of things
that come back to haunt you

20:37.167 --> 20:39.500
in the middle of the night.

20:39.583 --> 20:41.458
The last time we spoke,
it ended up with a slammed door

20:41.542 --> 20:43.667
and me on the last flight out.

20:45.042 --> 20:47.375
We haven't talked since then.

20:47.458 --> 20:49.458
For the past two years
I've wanted to call her

20:49.542 --> 20:52.667
I've needed to call her, but..

20:52.750 --> 20:55.167
...I didn't know if she'd
even wanna hear from me.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.875
And now this.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.208
Talia, I have to talk to her.
I need to know if she's okay.

21:01.292 --> 21:03.583
I sympathize,
Mr. Garibaldi, I do.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.583
I hope you realize that.

21:05.667 --> 21:07.625
But what do you expect me
to do about it?

21:07.708 --> 21:09.000
If you can't get through,
how am I--

21:09.083 --> 21:10.333
Psi Corp's got an intelligence

21:10.417 --> 21:13.042
in training operation
in Syria Planum.

21:13.125 --> 21:14.333
How did you know
about this center?

21:14.417 --> 21:15.750
That's supposed to be
classified.

21:15.833 --> 21:18.250
It is, but that's never
stopped me before.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.917
The point is they've got
the equipment to put together

21:20.000 --> 21:21.500
a relay,
get me into the local com-net.

21:21.583 --> 21:22.917
I could take it from there.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.375
- You're asking a lot.
- I know.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.167
And if there were
any other way, I'd take it.

21:27.250 --> 21:30.667
Talia, I can't sleep
not knowing if she's okay.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.250
You're my last hope.

21:34.292 --> 21:35.583
Alright.

21:35.667 --> 21:38.042
I can't promise anything

21:38.125 --> 21:39.875
but I'll do what I can.

21:40.667 --> 21:41.708
Thanks.

21:48.208 --> 21:50.750
[intense music]

21:52.208 --> 21:54.208
(Tasaki)
'Survey 1 to Babylon Control.'

21:54.292 --> 21:56.417
Now beginning our final run.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.250
Initiating atmosphere drop
to five kilometers

21:59.333 --> 22:00.833
inside the atmosphere curtain.

22:00.917 --> 22:03.500
Negative, Survey 1.
Do not enter atmosphere.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.250
The fighters
won't be able to follow you in.

22:05.333 --> 22:07.833
Don't worry, Babylon Control.
I'm not going far.

22:07.917 --> 22:10.500
Just enough to get some samples,
you can't expect us

22:10.583 --> 22:12.208
to come this far
without getting some minimal--

22:12.292 --> 22:15.833
Doctor, there's something
down there coming our way fast.

22:18.250 --> 22:21.083
[whirring]

22:21.167 --> 22:23.083
Take evasive action!
Get us out of here!

22:23.167 --> 22:25.667
[intense music]

22:25.750 --> 22:28.250
Too late, we've got lock-on.

22:28.333 --> 22:29.375
Hang on!

22:31.333 --> 22:32.583
[explosion]

22:32.667 --> 22:34.417
Aft stabilizers hit!

22:34.500 --> 22:36.583
Forty-percent power loss!

22:36.667 --> 22:39.208
Full power the engines. One more
like that and we've had it!

22:40.333 --> 22:41.417
Incoming!

22:41.500 --> 22:44.583
[music continues]

22:47.708 --> 22:49.250
[intense music]

22:50.500 --> 22:51.667
Babylon Control
to Fighter Escort.

22:51.750 --> 22:52.958
Can you reach the shuttle?

22:53.042 --> 22:55.208
(female #1)
'Negative, Babylon Control.'

22:55.292 --> 22:57.625
All fighters, target guns
on lower atmosphere

22:57.708 --> 22:59.500
wide-angle firing pattern.

22:59.583 --> 23:02.625
[zapping]

23:05.208 --> 23:06.667
[explosion]

23:08.333 --> 23:10.042
Babylon Control,
what the hell are you doing?

23:10.125 --> 23:11.708
Incoming fires
distract the missiles

23:11.792 --> 23:12.958
pulling them off-course.

23:13.042 --> 23:15.167
Hit your afterburners.
Maximum burn.

23:15.250 --> 23:17.375
With any luck, they can't follow
you outside the atmosphere.

23:17.458 --> 23:19.292
(Tasaki)
'We won't have enough fuel
to get back.'

23:19.375 --> 23:20.750
The fighters
will tow you back in.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.167
Now do it before the missiles
lock on again!

23:23.250 --> 23:26.292
[whirring]

23:30.042 --> 23:32.167
(Tasaki)
'Survey 1 to Babylon Control.'

23:32.250 --> 23:33.792
'We're clear.
Returning to base.'

23:33.875 --> 23:35.417
Confirmed, Survey 1,
upon arrival

23:35.500 --> 23:37.625
report for debriefing.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.625
And just one more thing,
on your trip back

23:39.708 --> 23:43.833
I'd like you to take the time
mantra.

23:43.917 --> 23:46.625
Ivanova is always right.

23:46.708 --> 23:48.250
I will listen to Ivanova.

23:48.333 --> 23:51.167
I will not ignore
Ivanova's recommendations.

23:51.250 --> 23:53.708
Ivanova is God.

23:53.792 --> 23:55.292
And if this ever happens again

23:55.375 --> 23:58.167
Ivanova will personally
rip your lungs out!

23:58.250 --> 23:59.708
Babylon Control out.

24:04.208 --> 24:06.417
[sighs]
Civilians.

24:07.625 --> 24:10.500
Just kidding
about that God part. No offense.

24:15.458 --> 24:17.625
(Tasaki)
'All our previous scans
failed to show any life forms'

24:17.708 --> 24:19.917
'or any automatic systems
on the surface of the planet'

24:20.042 --> 24:22.625
or for a depth of two miles
inside Epsilon 3.

24:22.708 --> 24:25.167
Doctor, those missiles
had to come from somewhere.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.667
Agreed, and if you come with me

24:27.750 --> 24:29.500
I think we've solved
the mystery.

24:29.583 --> 24:31.375
We didn't go deep enough.

24:31.917 --> 24:33.042
Here.

24:34.292 --> 24:35.625
This is a computer-enhanced

24:35.708 --> 24:38.042
'high-resolution scan
of Sector 14.'

24:38.125 --> 24:40.125
We snared it
just before we were fired upon.

24:40.208 --> 24:42.250
- I don't see anything.
- Not yet.

24:42.333 --> 24:44.167
Increase magnification.

24:46.750 --> 24:50.625
There, that's one of the first
group of missiles fired at us.

24:50.708 --> 24:52.042
It came from underground.

24:52.125 --> 24:54.125
That fissure,
is it natural or artificial?

24:54.208 --> 24:56.875
Hard to say.
My guess is artificial.

24:56.958 --> 24:58.583
It was probably opened
by one of the quakes

24:58.667 --> 25:00.167
that have hit that region
lately.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.250
So it's possible this is
an old automatic defense system

25:02.333 --> 25:03.833
that there's no one
actually down there anymore.

25:03.917 --> 25:04.875
That's my theory, yes.

25:04.958 --> 25:06.292
How deep is that fissure?

25:06.375 --> 25:08.667
Ah, that's
the interesting thing.

25:08.750 --> 25:10.458
Our analysis of the data
suggests

25:10.542 --> 25:12.042
the missile was fired

25:12.125 --> 25:14.542
five miles
within the planet surface.

25:14.625 --> 25:17.667
There's something down there,
something important enough

25:17.750 --> 25:20.583
to require
a pretty lethal defense system.

25:20.667 --> 25:22.792
Very good. Thank you, doctor.

25:24.833 --> 25:26.042
- Analysis?
- Well..

25:26.125 --> 25:27.458
We don't know
what other long-range

25:27.542 --> 25:28.750
weaponry might be down there.

25:28.833 --> 25:30.500
So until we know more,
I'd definitely consider it

25:30.583 --> 25:32.125
a threat to station security.

25:32.208 --> 25:33.750
Same here.

25:33.833 --> 25:36.417
It's also a potential
first-contact situation.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.500
I'd say we pretty much have to
go down there and check it out.

25:38.583 --> 25:40.583
Wouldn't you agree,
lieutenant commander?

25:40.667 --> 25:41.958
Absolutely.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.375
(Londo)
'And he says, "Goulash."
Do you get it?'

25:47.458 --> 25:49.792
[Londo laughs]

25:49.875 --> 25:52.583
Get you yet. Oh..

25:52.667 --> 25:54.667
Ah, Mr. Garibaldi

25:54.750 --> 25:57.917
off-duty, I see. Mm-hmm.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.167
[sniffs]
Water.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.500
Fascinating.

26:02.583 --> 26:05.292
I never touch the stuff myself.

26:09.583 --> 26:11.500
Kat, the usual.

26:12.875 --> 26:15.333
Is there something
I can do for you, ambassador?

26:15.417 --> 26:16.667
Yes.

26:17.167 --> 26:18.542
Attend.

26:18.625 --> 26:20.208
As a young Centauri

26:20.292 --> 26:22.292
I developed a preoccupation

26:22.375 --> 26:24.875
with the female
of my particular species.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.042
I went to all the finest clubs

26:27.125 --> 26:30.333
watched the most exotic
Centauri dancers.

26:30.417 --> 26:34.542
'Now, one day
I was angry and upset.'

26:34.625 --> 26:39.208
But I went to the club,
I sat, watched the show..

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
..but never saw it.

26:42.083 --> 26:45.458
'I just sat and stewed.'

26:45.542 --> 26:48.083
Suddenly I looked up

26:48.167 --> 26:50.667
and this beautiful dancer

26:50.750 --> 26:54.333
is leaning down over the stage

26:54.417 --> 26:57.250
and looking right into my eyes.

26:57.333 --> 26:58.625
And she said..

26:59.792 --> 27:01.625
"Whatever it is

27:01.708 --> 27:04.708
it can't be that bad."

27:06.083 --> 27:08.208
And then she kissed me..

27:08.958 --> 27:11.083
...right here.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.083
Mr. Garibaldi..

27:16.833 --> 27:19.042
...whatever it is

27:19.125 --> 27:22.500
it can't be that bad.

27:23.292 --> 27:26.292
[Londo laughing]

27:30.875 --> 27:32.625
You try and kiss me,
and I'll break your arm.

27:32.708 --> 27:34.708
[both laughing]

27:34.792 --> 27:37.708
We're not that close,
Mr. Garibaldi!

27:37.792 --> 27:40.042
- And the dancer?
- Oh, I married her.

27:40.125 --> 27:43.417
- No!
- Yes, that day!

27:43.500 --> 27:44.958
The next day I woke up

27:45.042 --> 27:48.625
I saw her in the light of day
sleeping against my arm

27:48.708 --> 27:52.542
and I decided
I would rather chew off my arm

27:52.625 --> 27:53.708
than wake her up.

27:53.792 --> 27:55.833
- Oh, that's sweet.
- No, no.

27:55.917 --> 27:59.125
She had a voice
that could curdle fresh milk.

27:59.208 --> 28:01.542
"Londo!" "Yes, dear?"

28:01.625 --> 28:03.833
"Londo!" "Coming, my darling."

28:03.917 --> 28:05.458
[laughs]

28:05.542 --> 28:07.292
"I'll be right there,
my love bug."

28:07.375 --> 28:09.792
[laughing]

28:09.875 --> 28:11.083
Mm..

28:12.500 --> 28:14.417
You looked
as if you needed a friend.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.333
[laughs]
Oh, I did.

28:16.417 --> 28:18.667
- Thanks.
- Ah, you're welcome.

28:18.750 --> 28:22.917
Now I go to spread happiness
to the rest of the station.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.167
It's a terrible responsibility

28:25.250 --> 28:27.083
but I have learned
to live with it.

28:27.167 --> 28:30.208
[both laughing]

28:35.500 --> 28:36.917
Hey!

28:37.000 --> 28:39.292
Somebody better pay
for that drink.

28:41.208 --> 28:42.458
Oh..

28:45.208 --> 28:46.583
[beeping]

28:51.125 --> 28:54.167
[intense music]

28:56.667 --> 28:58.500
Help me.

29:01.917 --> 29:03.750
Help me.

29:08.625 --> 29:10.375
[intense music]

29:10.458 --> 29:13.667
Alright, Delta Flight, standby.
We're ready to go in.

29:13.750 --> 29:16.083
On our signal,
target a ten-kilometer area

29:16.167 --> 29:17.250
with long-range bursts

29:17.333 --> 29:18.542
to draw off incoming fire

29:18.625 --> 29:19.583
as we go in.

29:19.667 --> 29:21.125
(male #7)
'Confirmed, Shuttle 1.'

29:21.208 --> 29:22.500
Systems ready.

29:22.583 --> 29:25.833
- Engines to maximum burn.
- Hit it.

29:25.917 --> 29:27.917
[whirring]

29:29.708 --> 29:32.625
Temperature up 200 degrees.
Coming in awfully steep.

29:32.708 --> 29:35.333
[whirring]

29:35.417 --> 29:38.208
- Missile sighted.
- Delta Flight, fire.

29:38.292 --> 29:39.792
[zapping]

29:39.875 --> 29:41.500
[explosion]

29:46.375 --> 29:48.167
Let's hope Tasaki was right
about that fissure

29:48.250 --> 29:49.875
being five miles deep.

29:49.958 --> 29:51.333
Because on our present speed
it's gonna take

29:51.417 --> 29:52.833
at least two miles to decelerate

29:52.917 --> 29:54.750
assuming we don't hit anything
on the way in.

29:54.833 --> 29:57.500
This is a hell of a time
to think of that.

29:57.583 --> 30:00.625
[whooshing]

30:02.958 --> 30:05.333
[intense music]

30:06.542 --> 30:07.667
(Sinclair)
Lights.

30:13.625 --> 30:14.875
Decelerating.

30:14.958 --> 30:15.958
Two miles.

30:16.042 --> 30:18.208
Two point five. Three.

30:18.292 --> 30:20.500
Anterior thrusters, half power.

30:20.583 --> 30:21.833
Thrusters, aye.

30:21.917 --> 30:24.917
[whirring]

30:26.792 --> 30:28.458
- Anything?
- Just rock.

30:28.542 --> 30:30.417
Three-point-five miles.

30:30.500 --> 30:31.708
Four miles.

30:31.792 --> 30:33.750
Slowing descent 30%.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.875
Four-point-five.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.042
We've got something.
It's an opening, alright.

30:39.125 --> 30:40.500
Definitely artificial.

30:40.583 --> 30:42.208
Bring us in.

30:42.292 --> 30:45.333
[whooshing]

30:50.792 --> 30:52.250
Coming into a landing grid.

30:52.333 --> 30:55.375
[whirring]

31:03.792 --> 31:06.083
Environment check.

31:06.167 --> 31:08.167
Gravity .75 of Earth normal.

31:08.250 --> 31:10.167
Atmosphere 90% carbon dioxide

31:10.250 --> 31:12.000
10% trace elements.

31:12.083 --> 31:13.583
We'll definitely need
those breathers.

31:13.667 --> 31:15.750
- Life signs?
- None.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.458
So far it looks like
we're the only living things

31:17.542 --> 31:19.167
in or on this planet.

31:19.250 --> 31:21.583
Alright, let's check it out.

31:22.875 --> 31:25.917
[intense music]

31:31.250 --> 31:34.250
(female #2)
'I'm sorry, Ms. Winters,
but there's nothing I can do.'

31:34.333 --> 31:36.458
In order to preserve
our confidential status

31:36.542 --> 31:38.375
access to our facility
is confined

31:38.458 --> 31:40.125
only to the members
of Psi Corps.

31:40.208 --> 31:42.333
We can't let anyone
outside the government

31:42.417 --> 31:43.708
know the center exists.

31:43.792 --> 31:45.917
But Mr. Garibaldi
already knows about it.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.792
He may suspect, but that is
not the same as confirmation.

31:49.875 --> 31:53.000
For all we know, this request
on his part is only a cover

31:53.083 --> 31:54.625
so that he can confirm
our location

31:54.708 --> 31:56.875
and pass that information
along to others.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.083
[scoffs]
That's completely paranoid.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.625
Possibly,
but with fighting going on

32:01.708 --> 32:03.667
less than a quarter mile
from the facility

32:03.750 --> 32:06.500
I think we're entitled
to a little paranoia.

32:06.583 --> 32:08.958
- How is it back there?
- 'Not good.'

32:09.042 --> 32:10.208
The Free Mars movement

32:10.292 --> 32:12.125
has been growing
for nearly a decade

32:12.208 --> 32:14.708
but no one suspected
they were this organized

32:14.792 --> 32:16.417
'or this well-armed.'

32:16.500 --> 32:19.708
Look, I can't plug your friend
into the com-net from here

32:19.792 --> 32:22.500
but I can run a check
on her name

32:22.583 --> 32:24.667
and see if she's listed
among the wounded.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.792
That would help. Thank you.

32:26.875 --> 32:30.333
No promises,
but, uh, I'll do what I can.

32:32.042 --> 32:33.917
PCC relay out.

32:37.708 --> 32:39.000
[exhales sharply]

33:07.083 --> 33:10.125
[dramatic music]

33:12.042 --> 33:13.333
Commander.

33:17.125 --> 33:20.167
[intense music]

33:30.917 --> 33:32.000
Wait.

33:46.833 --> 33:49.542
[electricity crackling]

33:53.042 --> 33:55.542
Well, that'll cut down
on tourism.

34:05.583 --> 34:07.333
[electricity crackling]

34:07.417 --> 34:11.417
One, two, three, four.

34:12.708 --> 34:15.042
[electricity crackling]

34:15.125 --> 34:18.208
One, two, three.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.833
Three-second recharge
before firing.

34:22.917 --> 34:26.083
Looks like it. Can you
cover that in three seconds?

34:26.167 --> 34:29.292
- Not a problem.
- Okay. Stand by.

34:31.292 --> 34:34.333
[intense music]

34:38.292 --> 34:40.417
[electricity crackling]

34:40.500 --> 34:41.750
(Sinclair)
Go!

34:43.000 --> 34:44.875
[electricity crackling]

34:44.958 --> 34:46.542
- Get down!
- Ah!

34:49.958 --> 34:52.417
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Fine.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.500
Uh, commander

35:08.583 --> 35:10.583
you'd better
take a look at this.

35:21.500 --> 35:22.708
Holy..

35:22.792 --> 35:25.875
[instrumental music]

35:35.333 --> 35:36.875
(Ivanova)
Commander?

35:37.917 --> 35:39.625
(Sinclair)
Yeah?

35:39.708 --> 35:43.208
(Ivanova)
I think I've got to go
to the bathroom.

35:43.292 --> 35:45.167
(Sinclair)
Tell me about it.

35:50.792 --> 35:52.708
[whirring]

35:53.500 --> 35:55.458
[Londo sighs]

35:56.500 --> 35:57.625
[beeping]

35:57.708 --> 35:58.833
Come.

35:58.917 --> 36:01.083
[door whirring]

36:01.167 --> 36:03.958
Ah, Delenn,
what can I do for you?

36:04.042 --> 36:06.542
I was taking my friend
on a tour of the station

36:06.625 --> 36:08.417
and thought
I would introduce you.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.875
Draal, this is
Ambassador Londo Mollari

36:10.958 --> 36:12.792
of the Centauri Republic.

36:12.875 --> 36:15.333
Ambassador Mollari,
this is Draal

36:15.417 --> 36:18.208
for many years,
my mentor and teacher.

36:18.292 --> 36:20.958
- I am honored.
- Thank you.

36:21.042 --> 36:23.458
- I hope we are not intruding.
- Oh, no, no, no.

36:23.542 --> 36:25.792
I was just doing
a little studying.

36:25.875 --> 36:28.500
- Oh.
- Yes, Earthers.

36:28.583 --> 36:31.083
I-I try to find out
as much as I can about them

36:31.167 --> 36:32.542
to try to make
some sense of them

36:32.625 --> 36:35.250
but it never seems
to come together.

36:35.333 --> 36:37.792
They do seem to be
a mass of contradictions.

36:37.875 --> 36:39.583
Exactly my point.

36:39.667 --> 36:43.500
Here, 6000 years
of recorded history

36:43.583 --> 36:46.375
a history that includes
remarkable composers

36:46.458 --> 36:48.417
'astonishing symphonies.'

36:48.500 --> 36:50.750
But what is the one song

36:50.833 --> 36:53.333
that half of them
sing to their children

36:53.417 --> 36:55.958
generation after generation?

37:00.500 --> 37:03.792
♪ You put your right hand in
you put your right hand out ♪

37:03.875 --> 37:07.750
♪ You put your whole self in
and you turn yourself about ♪

37:07.833 --> 37:11.417
♪ You do the hokey pokey
you give a little shout ♪

37:11.500 --> 37:14.333
♪ That's what it's all about ♪♪

37:16.500 --> 37:18.292
'It doesn't mean anything!'

37:18.375 --> 37:20.625
I have been studying it
for seven days!

37:20.708 --> 37:22.583
I had the computer analyze it.

37:22.667 --> 37:23.833
I swear to you

37:23.917 --> 37:27.292
it does not mean a thing!

37:27.375 --> 37:29.708
We've come at a bad time,
haven't we?

37:29.792 --> 37:31.458
[laughs]
No.

37:31.542 --> 37:33.917
No, no, not at all.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.042
Here, sit.
I'll make some hot jala.

37:39.750 --> 37:42.042
I rather enjoyed the song.

37:42.125 --> 37:44.167
- Don't tell him.
- You're sure?

37:44.250 --> 37:45.667
Trust me.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.833
(Garibaldi)
'Try to raise
the shuttle again.'

37:56.917 --> 37:59.750
Nothing.
We still can't get through.

37:59.833 --> 38:01.792
Damn. Two hours.

38:02.958 --> 38:06.125
Mr. Garibaldi,
can I see you for a moment?

38:06.208 --> 38:07.792
I've had some news.

38:09.250 --> 38:11.167
- Yell if they link in.
- 'Yes, sir.'

38:16.958 --> 38:18.417
Well?

38:18.500 --> 38:21.375
They won't let you access
the local communications net.

38:21.458 --> 38:23.708
They're not happy about you
knowing about the center either.

38:23.792 --> 38:25.917
Yeah, well,
it's an imperfect universe.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.875
- Is that all you've got for me?
- No. No, it isn't.

38:28.958 --> 38:30.208
I asked them to check the nets

38:30.292 --> 38:32.125
for any information
about your friend.

38:32.208 --> 38:34.042
They couldn't get into the logs
for the dead or wounded

38:34.125 --> 38:36.708
but they were able to access
the list of survivors.

38:36.792 --> 38:39.167
- And?
- 'Her name isn't on it.'

38:39.250 --> 38:41.083
They can't find her name
anywhere.

38:41.167 --> 38:42.875
So either
she's not on Mars anymore--

38:42.958 --> 38:45.125
She's there, alright?
She had a life there, a career.

38:45.208 --> 38:47.042
She wouldn't have left all that
in just two years..

38:47.125 --> 38:49.958
Then it's possible that
something's happened to her.

38:50.042 --> 38:51.792
[beeping]

38:51.875 --> 38:53.708
- Yeah?
- 'Mr. Garibaldi.'

38:53.792 --> 38:57.625
- 'We've got a signal.'
- I'm on my way.

38:57.708 --> 38:59.417
I'm sorry.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.250
Oh, don't be. She's alright.

39:02.333 --> 39:05.417
She has to be.
That's all there is to it.

39:06.917 --> 39:08.958
(Sinclair)
'It must be 10..'

39:09.708 --> 39:12.167
'...20 miles deep.'

39:12.250 --> 39:14.958
- Commander, you okay?
- 'We're fine.'

39:15.042 --> 39:17.042
(Sinclair)
'Michael,
you wouldn't believe it.'

39:17.125 --> 39:18.417
'Incredible!'

39:18.500 --> 39:20.917
'A whole new area
of technology.'

39:21.000 --> 39:25.208
'Machines as big as buildings
all around us.'

39:25.292 --> 39:27.583
- What's happening?
- Picking up seismic activity.

39:27.667 --> 39:28.917
- It's a big one.
- Commander.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.583
Get the hell out of there!
You hear me?

39:30.667 --> 39:31.708
Clear out!

39:31.792 --> 39:34.833
[intense music]

39:36.667 --> 39:39.750
[rumbling]

39:42.333 --> 39:45.125
Commander! Jeff! Ivanova!

39:45.208 --> 39:46.625
We've lost them.

39:50.042 --> 39:51.292
Commander, you alright?

39:51.375 --> 39:53.625
Yeah, I think so.

39:53.708 --> 39:56.125
We're gonna have to find
another way out of here.

39:56.208 --> 39:57.708
This light's had it.

40:02.167 --> 40:03.583
What the hell?

40:03.667 --> 40:05.542
Help me.

40:05.625 --> 40:08.292
Please help me.

40:14.333 --> 40:18.125
- You saw it, too?
- Yeah, and on the station.

40:31.417 --> 40:32.500
Commander.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.083
[instrumental music]

40:59.583 --> 41:01.417
Help me..

41:02.333 --> 41:04.083
...or your people

41:04.167 --> 41:06.792
all your people

41:06.875 --> 41:08.417
will die.

You must help me.

[rumbling]

41:40.500 --> 41:42.375
Help me get him out of this.

41:42.458 --> 41:44.583
Commander,
we don't have a lot of time.

41:44.667 --> 41:45.958
We're cut off
from the way we came in.

41:46.042 --> 41:47.417
We don't know if we can find
another way back

41:47.500 --> 41:48.917
to the ship
before we run out of air.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.375
We can't leave him like this.

41:50.458 --> 41:51.750
(Ivanova)
'I know, I know.'

41:51.833 --> 41:53.250
'It's a Russian thing.'

41:53.333 --> 41:54.750
When we're about to do
something stupid

41:54.833 --> 41:57.500
we like to catalog
the full extent of our stupidity

41:57.583 --> 41:59.167
for future reference.

Jeff. Yeah, yeah.
We're getting you.

- What's your situation?
- 'We're coming out.'

42:16.625 --> 42:18.125
[whirring]

42:19.667 --> 42:21.250
Tell the fighters
to initiate air cover

42:21.333 --> 42:23.750
and have a full medical team
standing by when we arrive.

42:23.833 --> 42:25.750
Confirmed. Initiating air cover.

42:25.833 --> 42:27.667
I want that med team at Bay 14
in ten minutes.

42:27.750 --> 42:29.708
I'll meet them there.

through the jumpgate.

- Mr. Garibaldi, it's big!
