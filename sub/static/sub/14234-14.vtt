00:00.397 --> 00:01.761
<i>Previously on
The Event...</i>

00:01.786 --> 00:02.886
What do you want?

00:03.011 --> 00:04.211
Dempsey's played us both.

00:04.378 --> 00:05.916
You need to tell him
how he was behind

00:06.015 --> 00:07.148
trying to kill the President.

00:07.216 --> 00:08.983
I was manipulated
by a very powerful man.

00:09.051 --> 00:11.336
- Who is it?
- It was--

00:11.403 --> 00:12.470
You're gonna give me
the name,

00:12.538 --> 00:13.821
or I will make sure
you pay for it.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.089
I am the Vice President,

00:15.157 --> 00:17.058
and that's
the way it's going to stay.

00:17.126 --> 00:20.028
- The boy, what's his name?
- Sean Walker.

00:20.095 --> 00:22.830
I have a feeling
that this Mr. Walker and I

00:22.898 --> 00:24.866
will cross paths again.

00:24.934 --> 00:27.068
These people are trying
to have the President killed.

00:27.136 --> 00:28.770
Don't you want to stop them?

00:28.837 --> 00:31.339
You can't run away,
little guy.

00:36.345 --> 00:37.845
- This is Samantha...
- Come in.

00:37.896 --> 00:40.582
And my daughter Leila.
This is Mr. Geller.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.584
You and Sam
will be safe here.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.519
Once we use the portal
to bring our people here,

00:44.570 --> 00:46.354
then we will own it all.

00:46.405 --> 00:48.456
Sophia,
you have to stop him.

00:48.524 --> 00:50.224
- I don't know where he is.
- I trusted you.

00:50.292 --> 00:51.926
And once again,
it was all lies.

00:51.994 --> 00:53.394
No. That's not
what I intended.

00:53.462 --> 00:54.529
We broke through
the encryption.

00:54.580 --> 00:55.863
She's somewhere
in San Francisco.

00:55.914 --> 00:57.949
- I want her.
- Mr. President, in the past,

00:58.033 --> 00:59.951
you've always taken the use
of force off the table.

01:00.035 --> 01:01.769
She has played me for a fool
for the last time.

01:01.837 --> 01:03.638
May God rest her soul.

01:03.706 --> 01:06.908
Sir, it's
a communication satellite.

01:06.976 --> 01:08.710
They're sending
a message home.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.772 --> 01:22.523
Oh, no.

01:36.171 --> 01:38.740
Spikes are concentrated
at the same frequencies.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.041
What do you think?

01:40.109 --> 01:42.126
Could be radiation
from those stellar flares

01:42.211 --> 01:44.329
altair has been throwing.

01:44.413 --> 01:46.247
At that level of intensity
and regularity?

01:46.298 --> 01:48.349
No, no.

01:48.417 --> 01:52.003
Oh, that's
not Altair talking.

01:52.087 --> 01:54.288
Look, see,
there's a pattern.

01:54.356 --> 01:57.141
And it is aimed right at us.

01:57.226 --> 01:59.627
This is some kind of message.

01:59.695 --> 02:01.929
We have to call
the N.S.A. right now.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.147
This is exactly
the kind of anomaly

02:03.232 --> 02:04.465
they asked us
to look out for.

02:04.533 --> 02:06.801
Slow down.
Before we start ringing alarms,

02:06.869 --> 02:09.169
let's check if it matches
an elliptical orbit first.

02:09.238 --> 02:12.106
Chances are, it's nothing.
All right, all right.

02:12.157 --> 02:14.042
You reposition the telescopes
to the frequency,

02:14.109 --> 02:15.710
and I'll punch up NOVA.

02:28.624 --> 02:29.691
Come on.

02:33.145 --> 02:35.396
It's a message.

02:35.464 --> 02:38.066
I was right.

02:41.353 --> 02:44.689
Yes, you were.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.359
Careful.
You drop these rods,

02:48.444 --> 02:50.745
you could irradiate
this entire airfield.

02:50.813 --> 02:53.481
Thomas, it's Anthony.
He says it's urgent.

02:53.549 --> 02:54.866
What is it?

02:54.950 --> 02:57.952
We received a response
to the message you sent home.

02:58.019 --> 03:01.122
So what does it say?

03:01.189 --> 03:02.323
Anthony?

03:02.374 --> 03:04.759
It's complicated.

03:04.827 --> 03:07.495
What does it say?

03:11.633 --> 03:13.718
All right.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.803
Copy all the data we need
and wipe everything clean

03:15.871 --> 03:17.071
and get out of there.

03:17.139 --> 03:20.241
The government can't know
about the message.

03:20.309 --> 03:23.678
What is it?

03:23.746 --> 03:26.514
Something terrible
has happened back home.

03:32.955 --> 03:36.859
The Event 1x14
A Message Back

03:36.884 --> 03:39.957
-- sync, corrected by elderman --

04:01.054 --> 04:03.238
The girl
in the purple sweater.

04:04.741 --> 04:07.025
- You sure?
- Oh, yes.

04:07.093 --> 04:10.329
She's one
of the special ones.

04:11.831 --> 04:14.266
I'll be leaving
for the airport in, uh--

04:14.334 --> 04:15.984
well, pretty soon.

04:16.052 --> 04:20.204
I'd like her in our possession
by the time I get back.

04:20.273 --> 04:23.108
Of course, Dr. Dempsey.

04:23.176 --> 04:26.211
I'll make sure that we have some
of the extract waiting for you.

04:26.279 --> 04:27.846
Oh, good.
Yes.

04:27.914 --> 04:30.249
It's important
I stay in good health...

04:30.316 --> 04:32.551
Now more than ever

04:32.602 --> 04:35.220
so that I can, um...

04:36.623 --> 04:39.091
See this through.

04:50.620 --> 04:51.787
Here you go.

04:51.871 --> 04:53.038
Thank you.

04:53.089 --> 04:54.640
Is that for catching
butterflies?

04:54.707 --> 04:57.276
For turtles.
They live in the pond.

04:57.343 --> 04:58.844
I bet there are
a lot of turtles in there

04:58.912 --> 05:00.212
that would like
to come home with you.

05:00.263 --> 05:02.714
- Really?
- Sure.

05:02.782 --> 05:06.184
Everything
has to leave home sometime.

05:38.651 --> 05:39.985
Walker.

05:40.053 --> 05:41.954
I'm not here to kill you,
so don't overreact

05:42.021 --> 05:44.856
and try something stupid,
because I will shoot you.

05:44.924 --> 05:47.142
Back up.

05:49.162 --> 05:50.662
What do you want?

05:50.730 --> 05:52.598
I want to know
who you've been working for--

05:52.665 --> 05:54.666
people behind everything.

05:54.734 --> 05:56.335
They need to be stopped.

05:56.402 --> 05:58.337
And you're gonna help me
stop them.

05:58.404 --> 06:00.672
You made a big mistake
coming here.

06:00.740 --> 06:01.840
How did you find me?

06:01.908 --> 06:03.275
You were careful
covering up your tracks,

06:03.343 --> 06:04.610
but your mother wasn't.

06:04.677 --> 06:05.711
She used her old cell phone

06:05.778 --> 06:07.212
the last time
she called you here.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.915
So once I had that, tracking
down where you were was easy.

06:09.983 --> 06:11.416
Nice work.

06:11.484 --> 06:13.518
Now put down the gun
before I take it from you

06:13.586 --> 06:14.836
and make you sorry.

06:14.921 --> 06:16.722
You're gonna help me take down
the people you work for,

06:16.789 --> 06:18.757
because you might not care
about the things they've done,

06:18.825 --> 06:21.026
but I do,
and somebody has to stop them.

06:21.094 --> 06:22.827
- Quit fooling yourself.
- Back up.

06:22.879 --> 06:25.830
- You're a kid, not a man.
- Stop.

06:25.882 --> 06:27.132
They've taken
everything from me,

06:27.183 --> 06:28.833
and I'm not gonna run
from them any longer.

06:28.885 --> 06:31.169
So let's start
with the names.

06:31.237 --> 06:32.504
Who are they?

06:32.572 --> 06:33.972
Or what,
you're gonna shoot me?

06:34.040 --> 06:35.474
I think
I'll take my chances,

06:35.525 --> 06:39.578
because what you're talking
about trying to do is suicide.

06:39.646 --> 06:40.879
Well,
it's not your own life

06:40.947 --> 06:42.714
you need
to be worried about.

06:42.782 --> 06:44.082
What are
you talking about?

06:44.150 --> 06:46.184
I know your mom is
still taking care of your son.

06:46.252 --> 06:48.203
And their location
will go viral on the Internet

06:48.287 --> 06:50.355
unless you
give me those names.

06:50.423 --> 06:54.092
And I guarantee it'll make
its way into the wrong hands.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.294
You're lying.

06:56.362 --> 06:58.296
The virus
is controlled by a code

06:58.364 --> 07:00.399
I enter into my phone
every two hours.

07:00.466 --> 07:03.335
So if I'm not alive
to enter it...

07:03.403 --> 07:05.537
Your family's address
gets released.

07:11.177 --> 07:13.545
So the names...

07:13.613 --> 07:16.548
Who am I looking for?

07:19.235 --> 07:21.603
There's only one...

07:21.688 --> 07:23.188
James Dempsey.

07:23.239 --> 07:24.523
He's a billionaire

07:24.574 --> 07:27.559
and one of the most powerful men
in the country.

07:27.610 --> 07:30.195
But knowing who he is
isn't gonna do you any good.

07:30.263 --> 07:31.697
Why not?

07:31.764 --> 07:34.399
Because I already tried
taking him down and couldn't.

07:34.467 --> 07:36.134
Since then,
Dempsey's vanished.

07:36.202 --> 07:40.422
Nobody even
knows where he is.

07:40.506 --> 07:43.542
And you really tried
to stop him?

07:43.593 --> 07:46.011
How?

07:46.079 --> 07:49.381
By using
the Vice President.

07:50.683 --> 07:52.050
He and Dempsey were
in bed together

07:52.118 --> 07:56.021
on the assassination attempt
of President Martinez.

07:56.089 --> 07:58.757
Vice President Jarvis
is part of the conspiracy?

07:58.825 --> 08:00.926
Yeah.

08:00.993 --> 08:03.628
I tried convincing him
to go public.

08:03.696 --> 08:06.832
And if he can't stand up
to Dempsey,

08:06.899 --> 08:10.035
what chance
do you think you have?

08:10.103 --> 08:12.771
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

08:12.839 --> 08:14.990
And if you care
about your family,

08:15.074 --> 08:17.342
you're gonna help me.

08:19.712 --> 08:20.879
We know the sleepers

08:20.946 --> 08:22.964
are now in possession
of the uranium rods,

08:23.049 --> 08:24.616
which, if our intel is correct,

08:24.667 --> 08:27.252
puts them one step closer
to accomplishing their goal--

08:27.303 --> 08:29.421
bringing more of them here.

08:29.472 --> 08:32.640
Now, I take full responsibility
for what has happened.

08:32.725 --> 08:34.842
But make no mistake...

08:34.927 --> 08:37.462
The consequences of that,
an invasion,

08:37.513 --> 08:39.030
falls on all of us,

08:39.097 --> 08:40.966
which means,
from now forward,

08:41.033 --> 08:44.001
there can be no more mistakes,
from me or any of you.

08:44.070 --> 08:46.371
The stakes
are simply too high.

08:46.439 --> 08:49.674
We must stop Thomas and Sophia
before it's too late.

08:49.742 --> 08:51.143
Now, I want an update
on Sophia.

08:51.210 --> 08:54.045
Where are we on narrowing
her location in San Francisco?

08:54.113 --> 08:55.480
We are still waiting

08:55.548 --> 08:58.650
for her phone
to be activated again.

08:58.718 --> 09:00.886
As soon as she makes
or receives another call,

09:00.953 --> 09:02.487
we'll be able to pinpoint
where she is.

09:02.555 --> 09:03.622
In the meantime,

09:03.689 --> 09:05.557
we've mobilized
a direct action unit,

09:05.625 --> 09:07.459
consisting
of Special Ops Forces

09:07.510 --> 09:09.928
supported by every
local law enforcement agency.

09:09.996 --> 09:11.329
Local law enforcement?

09:11.397 --> 09:12.664
No, no, no.

09:12.732 --> 09:14.633
We've had Sophia escape
from under our noses before.

09:14.700 --> 09:15.867
I won't let
that happen again.

09:15.935 --> 09:18.370
No more mistakes--
I want the best on this.

09:18.437 --> 09:20.739
General, who are the best men
you have stationed

09:20.807 --> 09:22.407
in the vicinity?

09:22.475 --> 09:24.209
The Marine Fourth Force
Reconnaissance Company

09:24.277 --> 09:25.710
out of Alameda, sir.
Good.

09:25.778 --> 09:27.145
Prepare to deploy them.

09:27.196 --> 09:28.730
They should provide
adequate support.

09:28.815 --> 09:30.949
Now, you know
that I cannot do that, sir.

09:31.017 --> 09:32.984
The posse comitatus act
prohibits the use

09:33.052 --> 09:35.220
of United States
military forces on U.S. soil

09:35.288 --> 09:37.556
except for the case
of a natural disaster, sir.

09:37.623 --> 09:40.759
Thank you, general.
I'm well aware of federal law.

09:40.827 --> 09:42.327
I'm also aware
that when Congress passed

09:42.395 --> 09:45.030
posse comitatus
nearly 130 years ago,

09:45.097 --> 09:47.599
they weren't accounting for the
threat we're facing right now.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.367
So don't question me.
Just do it.

09:49.418 --> 09:50.635
Of course, Mr. President.

09:50.703 --> 09:52.254
So they'll work
with local law enforcement

09:52.338 --> 09:54.339
and with our Special Ops team.

09:54.407 --> 09:56.041
Blake, could you
brief your team now?

09:56.108 --> 09:59.344
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- Mr. Vice President.

10:03.082 --> 10:04.766
Thank you.

10:04.851 --> 10:06.384
Thank you.

10:06.435 --> 10:09.521
Thank you very much,
one and all.

10:09.589 --> 10:11.439
Please.

10:13.826 --> 10:15.443
Thank you.
General.

10:15.528 --> 10:19.063
- Glad you're back, sir.
- Thank you.

10:19.115 --> 10:22.334
Thank you very much.
It's, uh...

10:22.401 --> 10:24.903
It's good to be back.

10:52.448 --> 10:54.866
Thomas
played me perfectly.

10:54.934 --> 10:56.368
He knew I'd call Martinez

10:56.435 --> 10:58.470
and convince him
to move the uranium.

10:58.537 --> 11:01.306
Now he has everything
he needs to power the portal.

11:01.374 --> 11:03.675
And he's managed
to completely discredit me

11:03.743 --> 11:05.243
in Martinez's eyes.

11:05.311 --> 11:08.280
You reached out to Martinez
when you didn't have to.

11:08.347 --> 11:11.249
Maybe on some level, he knew
you were telling the truth.

11:11.317 --> 11:13.518
No, in his eyes,
I'm part of the enemy.

11:13.586 --> 11:16.321
Now there's nothing I can do
to convince him otherwise.

11:19.392 --> 11:22.060
Who has that number?

11:30.803 --> 11:32.337
Hello?

11:32.405 --> 11:33.939
Sophia...

11:33.990 --> 11:36.274
I wouldn't contact you
if I had a choice.

11:36.342 --> 11:38.360
But there's something important
we need to discuss.

11:38.444 --> 11:40.245
I don't think there's
anything left to talk about

11:40.313 --> 11:43.748
after what you've done.
Just hear me out, please.

11:43.816 --> 11:45.984
You're aware
of the message I sent home.

11:46.052 --> 11:48.687
- Yes.
- Well, we got a response.

11:48.754 --> 11:51.189
And it changes...

11:52.925 --> 11:55.560
It changes everything.

11:55.628 --> 11:58.530
We can't afford
to be divided any longer.

11:58.597 --> 12:00.699
Thomas, w-what
are you talking about?

12:00.766 --> 12:02.701
What was in the message?

12:02.768 --> 12:04.769
I can't explain now.

12:04.837 --> 12:06.771
This needs to be in person.

12:06.839 --> 12:09.407
Do you actually think
I-I'm foolish enough

12:09.475 --> 12:11.977
to accept your offer?

12:12.044 --> 12:13.945
Not just you--
everyone.

12:14.013 --> 12:15.480
I'm gathering
all of our people.

12:15.548 --> 12:17.882
This is something
they all need to hear.

12:17.950 --> 12:20.518
The future of our race
hangs in the balance.

12:20.569 --> 12:22.153
- I don't believe you.
- Then your people

12:22.221 --> 12:24.322
will hear what I have
to tell them without you.

12:24.373 --> 12:25.690
- Thomas--
- I'll be sending a text

12:25.758 --> 12:28.259
with the location
of the meeting soon.

12:29.795 --> 12:31.212
I hope you're there.

12:41.674 --> 12:43.408
Mr. President...

12:43.476 --> 12:45.877
You asked to see me?
Close the door.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.934
What do you think
you're doing here?

12:53.019 --> 12:54.652
Eli...

12:54.720 --> 12:57.255
Things--things have gotten worse
since I left.

12:57.323 --> 12:58.857
Don't you think it's time

12:58.924 --> 13:01.693
we put what's happened
behind us?

13:03.529 --> 13:06.064
Yeah, see, Ray...

13:06.115 --> 13:08.917
I may not be able to keep you
from walking into this building,

13:09.001 --> 13:10.935
but I can make your life
a living hell once you do.

13:11.003 --> 13:12.437
So, no, no.

13:12.505 --> 13:14.622
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to hear you.

13:14.707 --> 13:16.741
I don't want to get
a damn whiff of you.

13:16.809 --> 13:18.376
You understand me?

13:18.444 --> 13:21.446
After what happened,
you don't exist.

13:24.016 --> 13:26.751
With all due respect,
Mr. President,

13:26.819 --> 13:28.853
nothing has happened...

13:28.921 --> 13:32.057
Nothing on record, anyway.

13:32.124 --> 13:36.227
I ran on this ticket
to serve my country,

13:36.295 --> 13:39.397
to do what I think
are in its best interests.

13:39.465 --> 13:43.101
And I plan to continue
to do just that.

13:43.169 --> 13:44.402
You try and stop me,

13:44.470 --> 13:46.871
and I'll be forced
to expose everything

13:46.939 --> 13:51.076
you've been so carefully
trying to cover up.

13:53.712 --> 13:56.915
What'd you expect me to do,
stay home,

13:56.982 --> 13:59.501
cower under my desk
until our term expires?

13:59.585 --> 14:00.668
I don't think so.

14:00.753 --> 14:02.253
I may have
to tolerate you, Ray,

14:02.321 --> 14:03.755
but trust me,
you don't want to bait me.

14:03.806 --> 14:05.356
What do you think
you're doing?

14:05.424 --> 14:08.960
You stay
the hell out of my way.

14:10.930 --> 14:13.364
Mr. President...

14:13.432 --> 14:16.000
I'm sorry to interrupt.

14:16.068 --> 14:18.203
But there's news
about Sophia.

14:22.658 --> 14:24.659
- Mr. President.
- At ease.

14:24.743 --> 14:25.944
Tell me what you have.

14:26.011 --> 14:27.979
Sophia--
or her cell phone at least.

14:28.047 --> 14:30.832
Uh, we were able to get
a location on it

14:30.916 --> 14:32.617
because she had
just received a call.

14:32.685 --> 14:35.186
Are the Marines on their way?

14:35.254 --> 14:37.655
Yes, sir. They're dressing
as civilian law enforcement

14:37.723 --> 14:39.724
so as not to attract
any unneeded attention.

14:39.792 --> 14:42.260
Good. So as soon
as you're sure it's her,

14:42.327 --> 14:46.531
take her alive if you can.
But if you can't...

14:48.367 --> 14:51.302
Sir.

14:59.671 --> 15:01.939
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

15:02.007 --> 15:04.508
to gain access
to the Vice President,

15:04.560 --> 15:06.844
especially now, since
Dempsey's tried to kill him?

15:06.912 --> 15:08.529
Well, we'll just have
to figure out a way.

15:08.614 --> 15:10.748
Oh, okay.
Good.

15:10.816 --> 15:13.184
Good plan.

15:14.903 --> 15:16.854
When you
see signs for a place

15:16.905 --> 15:19.023
that might have Internet,
pull over.

15:19.074 --> 15:22.026
Until then, I want to know
more about Dempsey.

15:22.077 --> 15:24.045
How much do you know
about the girls he's abducted?

15:24.129 --> 15:26.998
Like the fact
that they're not human?

15:27.049 --> 15:30.001
Then you know
about the aliens.

15:30.052 --> 15:31.552
It's the reason
why he tried

15:31.637 --> 15:34.338
assassinating Martinez
in the first place.

15:34.389 --> 15:36.207
He didn't want
the President releasing them.

15:36.258 --> 15:37.391
Dempsey tried to keep

15:37.476 --> 15:40.678
the experiments
on the girls a secret.

15:40.729 --> 15:45.016
When I found out,
I knew I had to leave.

15:46.652 --> 15:49.654
I'm surprised he could do
anything to offend you.

15:51.490 --> 15:53.758
And what's that
supposed to mean?

15:53.826 --> 15:55.943
Do I have to list the things
you've done since I've met you?

15:56.028 --> 15:58.162
Kidnapping,
murdering innocent people...

15:58.230 --> 16:00.064
You think you know me,
but you don't.

16:00.115 --> 16:01.199
Well, that's my point.

16:01.250 --> 16:05.419
You make absolutely
no sense to me.

16:07.506 --> 16:11.742
My dad left my mom
when I was a kid.

16:11.794 --> 16:14.545
I don't even remember him.

16:14.596 --> 16:16.914
But I remember my stepdad.

16:16.982 --> 16:19.684
He was a real...

16:19.751 --> 16:21.352
Bastard.

16:21.419 --> 16:25.556
He started hitting my mom
from pretty much the word "go."

16:27.592 --> 16:32.313
It went on like that
until one day I had enough.

16:32.397 --> 16:36.200
So when he started
whaling on my mom,

16:36.268 --> 16:40.138
I went to the drawer
where I knew he kept his gun.

16:40.205 --> 16:43.324
And I took it out...

16:43.408 --> 16:46.711
And I shot him.

16:46.778 --> 16:48.779
I-I don't know
what to say.

16:48.831 --> 16:51.465
I'm--I'm sorry.

16:51.550 --> 16:53.584
Well, don't be,

16:53.635 --> 16:56.137
'cause that
whole sob story...

16:56.221 --> 16:59.157
I made it up.

16:59.224 --> 17:02.143
There's no reason
I am the way I am, Walker.

17:02.227 --> 17:04.811
I just came out this way.

17:09.401 --> 17:12.303
Come.

17:12.371 --> 17:14.839
I hope I'm not disturbing
you again.

17:14.906 --> 17:16.840
Depends.
Any word on Sophia?

17:16.909 --> 17:18.675
No. Not yet.

17:18.743 --> 17:20.845
But, uh...

17:20.913 --> 17:23.164
That's not why I'm here.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.585
We haven't had
much time to talk

17:27.653 --> 17:30.688
since I got back
from Inostranka.

17:30.756 --> 17:34.659
I wanted to check in,
see how you're doing.

17:34.726 --> 17:38.179
Stop beating
around the bush, Blake.

17:38.263 --> 17:42.633
You saw me confronting Ray,
and you're worried that I'm...

17:42.701 --> 17:44.468
I'm losing it.

17:44.536 --> 17:47.972
To put it bluntly, yes.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.557
But it's not just that.

17:49.641 --> 17:54.228
Your decision
to suspend posse comitatus...

17:54.313 --> 17:55.813
That's not like you.

17:55.864 --> 17:58.849
Um, that's
exactly the point.

18:00.903 --> 18:02.904
I'm not sure that I follow.

18:02.988 --> 18:06.190
Well, Sophia and her people
have been locked up

18:06.241 --> 18:08.626
at Inostranka for 66 years...

18:08.694 --> 18:13.197
Until I tried playing
the great emancipator.

18:13.265 --> 18:15.433
Now, we all know
how that worked out.

18:15.500 --> 18:19.203
Elias, you can't blame
yourself for everything that's--

18:19.254 --> 18:22.473
It's the truth.
Let's not sugarcoat it.

18:22.541 --> 18:25.843
Now, if I'm gonna fix
the mess I've gotten us into,

18:25.911 --> 18:27.545
then I need to change--

18:27.613 --> 18:29.013
me.

18:31.316 --> 18:34.735
Don't interrupt me again until
you have something on Sophia.

18:37.105 --> 18:39.240
Yes, Mr. President.

18:55.590 --> 18:59.427
So what am I supposed
to do when you die?

18:59.511 --> 19:01.445
Excuse me?

19:01.513 --> 19:03.514
Well, you're not getting
out of this thing alive,

19:03.582 --> 19:04.882
which means eventually

19:04.950 --> 19:07.618
my family's information
gets released.

19:07.686 --> 19:10.354
And it's not just you
that dies.

19:10.422 --> 19:12.923
It's my mother
and my son too.

19:12.991 --> 19:15.309
I guess you better
figure out a way

19:15.394 --> 19:18.396
to keep me alive, then.

19:20.949 --> 19:22.333
I think
I found something.

19:22.401 --> 19:24.669
- What is it?
- It's an article online.

19:24.736 --> 19:29.073
It says, uh, Jarvis is back to
work at the White House today.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.442
If you think I'm getting us
into the White House,

19:31.510 --> 19:33.044
you're crazy.

19:33.111 --> 19:34.612
No, but it also says

19:34.680 --> 19:37.281
that he's attending a party
fund-raiser later tonight.

19:37.349 --> 19:38.616
Where?

19:38.684 --> 19:43.220
Uh, the Ambassador Hotel,
downtown Washington.

19:43.288 --> 19:46.190
Can you hack
the guest list?

19:47.959 --> 19:49.810
Oh, come on, that's got to be

19:49.895 --> 19:52.229
nothing compared to hacking
the Pentagon mainframe

19:52.297 --> 19:53.764
as a sophomore
in high school.

19:53.815 --> 19:56.400
I...

19:56.468 --> 19:59.870
was a junior,
but how did you know that?

19:59.938 --> 20:01.972
You were my target once,
remember?

20:02.040 --> 20:06.110
I don't do any job
without doing my research first.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.746
Even if I add our names
or our aliases for that matter,

20:08.813 --> 20:10.948
there's no way we'll ever be
vetted to get in.

20:11.016 --> 20:12.917
That's why
we're gonna find people

20:12.984 --> 20:15.386
who've already been vetted
for us.

20:20.926 --> 20:24.428
Ted, what time
does the fund-raiser start?

20:24.496 --> 20:26.764
The money we paid--
I don't want to be late.

20:26.832 --> 20:28.099
7:30.

20:28.166 --> 20:29.767
Gonna need to get there
a little early, too,

20:29.834 --> 20:31.936
to get through
that security screening.

20:32.003 --> 20:35.106
Have you seen my cuff links?

20:35.173 --> 20:38.442
Did you check
your jacket pocket?

20:40.612 --> 20:43.714
Got them.

20:53.075 --> 20:54.708
Did you call down
for something?

20:54.793 --> 20:57.044
No.

20:59.131 --> 21:01.899
Hi.

21:01.967 --> 21:04.001
I-I think you have
the wrong room.

21:04.052 --> 21:05.936
Oh, no, no, no.
I locked myself out of my room.

21:06.004 --> 21:07.505
I'm so sorry to bother you.

21:07.572 --> 21:10.875
I was just wondering if--
if it's at all possible,

21:10.942 --> 21:12.543
I could use your phone
for a quick second

21:12.611 --> 21:13.978
to call down to the lobby?

21:14.045 --> 21:15.746
Of course. Of course.
Come on in.

21:15.814 --> 21:18.566
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

21:18.650 --> 21:21.718
Down on your knees.

21:31.002 --> 21:33.636
Just don't hurt us.

21:33.721 --> 21:36.639
You cooperate,
and we won't have to.

21:42.146 --> 21:46.433
- Their invitations and I.D.s?
- They're on the couch.

21:52.073 --> 21:54.407
Here.

21:54.475 --> 21:56.743
Remember, make sure
you get a clear impression.

21:56.811 --> 21:59.645
Any flaws, and we're not getting
past security.

22:26.741 --> 22:29.142
Status?

22:29.210 --> 22:30.377
Here.

22:35.750 --> 22:37.384
All right, pack it up.

22:37.451 --> 22:39.069
Jarvis knows
what I look like,

22:39.153 --> 22:41.955
so I still have
to change my appearance.

22:44.925 --> 22:47.693
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

22:49.463 --> 22:51.047
Wait, wait.
They're innocent.

22:51.132 --> 22:52.999
They saw our faces.

22:53.050 --> 22:54.918
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

22:55.002 --> 22:56.703
You're not doing this.

23:13.687 --> 23:16.022
What do you think
the message is?

23:16.073 --> 23:17.991
I don't know.

23:18.058 --> 23:20.577
But I think we owe it to
ourselves to go to this meeting

23:20.661 --> 23:22.612
and see what Thomas
has to say for himself.

23:22.696 --> 23:25.031
I don't trust Thomas,
and neither should you.

23:25.082 --> 23:27.300
Well, listen,
whether you do or not,

23:27.368 --> 23:28.468
the fact of the matter is,

23:28.536 --> 23:31.171
Thomas is gaining
more and more power.

23:31.238 --> 23:33.139
I don't want this
any more than you do, but...

23:36.610 --> 23:39.245
What is it?

23:39.296 --> 23:41.848
It's a text with the location
of the meeting.

23:41.915 --> 23:43.416
Where is it?

23:43.467 --> 23:45.919
It's in Los Angeles.

23:45.986 --> 23:47.887
I'm gonna go, okay?

23:47.938 --> 23:49.889
You don't have to.

23:49.940 --> 23:53.943
Leila and Samantha shouldn't be
alone anyway, all right?

23:54.028 --> 23:56.446
- Be careful.
- Of course.

23:56.530 --> 23:57.763
Okay.

24:23.891 --> 24:27.010
- I just got the text.
- So have many others.

24:31.098 --> 24:34.834
Thomas has everyone worried
about what the message might be.

24:34.902 --> 24:38.371
The few I've talked to
will go to the meeting.

24:40.574 --> 24:43.643
Thomas' Agent did intercept
a return message.

24:43.694 --> 24:44.911
He murdered his partner

24:44.979 --> 24:46.679
in order to make sure
it stayed a secret.

24:46.747 --> 24:49.916
Then I have to go.
I don't have a choice.

24:52.836 --> 24:55.255
Our people are starting
to be swayed by him.

24:55.322 --> 24:56.539
It doesn't matter
what the message is.

24:56.624 --> 24:58.458
I can't give Thomas
the opportunity

24:58.526 --> 25:00.360
to solidify
his power over them.

25:00.427 --> 25:02.295
He already tried
to kill you once.

25:02.363 --> 25:04.197
He won't try that again...

25:04.265 --> 25:06.099
Not there.

25:06.166 --> 25:08.768
He can't risk
turning too many of our people

25:08.836 --> 25:11.437
against him.

25:11.505 --> 25:14.774
Michael, I'm not gonna force you
to come with me.

25:14.842 --> 25:16.609
But I'm going.

25:16.677 --> 25:19.078
I have to.

25:19.146 --> 25:21.714
Then so am I.

25:26.070 --> 25:29.122
Good, good.

25:31.892 --> 25:34.861
General Armbruster,
you have permission to proceed.

25:34.929 --> 25:36.713
Take her down.

25:36.797 --> 25:38.498
Sir.

25:38.549 --> 25:40.066
Just a moment, sir.

25:40.134 --> 25:41.434
What is it?
Is there a problem?

25:41.502 --> 25:44.304
We've just intercepted
an SMS communication

25:44.371 --> 25:46.339
sent to Sophia.

25:46.407 --> 25:48.741
It's part
of a communication blast.

25:48.809 --> 25:50.777
It went out
to over 200 other phones.

25:50.844 --> 25:52.545
What's it say?

25:52.613 --> 25:54.480
It's too heavily encrypted.

25:54.548 --> 25:56.049
There's no way to know.

26:03.424 --> 26:05.742
Target is on the move.

26:05.826 --> 26:07.777
She's with Michael Buchanan.

26:07.861 --> 26:12.231
The pilot.
He must be one of them too.

26:12.299 --> 26:14.450
What's he up to with Sophia?

26:14.535 --> 26:16.869
We'll find out
when we take him down.

26:16.937 --> 26:19.172
Prepare to go on my command.

26:19.239 --> 26:21.774
She's holed up all day...

26:21.842 --> 26:23.109
Waiting for something.

26:23.177 --> 26:25.278
She receives a text message,

26:25.346 --> 26:27.981
and then she goes.

26:28.048 --> 26:29.432
Mr. President?

26:29.516 --> 26:31.517
It's not just a coincidence.
She left because of it.

26:31.585 --> 26:34.437
How many other people did you
say received that text message?

26:34.521 --> 26:35.955
Just over 200.

26:36.023 --> 26:38.941
Let me see.

26:39.026 --> 26:41.394
So this message...

26:41.445 --> 26:46.065
Could be instructions or...

26:46.133 --> 26:48.067
Or a location.

26:48.118 --> 26:49.452
They could be meeting.

26:49.536 --> 26:50.620
Tell your men to back off.

26:50.704 --> 26:52.271
Mr. President,
what are you doing?

26:52.339 --> 26:53.740
Do it, now.

26:53.791 --> 26:55.608
All teams, pull back.
Pull back immediately.

26:55.659 --> 26:57.343
This is your chance.
You said it yourself--

26:57.411 --> 26:58.778
we can't let Sophia
get away again.

26:58.829 --> 27:00.246
And we won't.
General, follow her.

27:00.297 --> 27:02.114
Don't let her out of your sight,
not even for a second.

27:02.166 --> 27:04.417
I don't want just Sophia.

27:04.485 --> 27:07.253
This is our chance
to get them all.

27:26.317 --> 27:27.484
Thank you, sir.

27:27.551 --> 27:30.653
Personal items
in the tray, please.

27:36.093 --> 27:38.862
- Stop it.
- What?

27:38.929 --> 27:41.481
Stop looking so nervous.

27:41.565 --> 27:44.868
We want them to think
we belong here.

27:44.935 --> 27:47.403
Thank you.

27:49.940 --> 27:52.158
Invitations and I.D.s,
please.

27:52.243 --> 27:53.943
Personal items
in the tray, please.

27:57.314 --> 27:59.115
I'll take that.

27:59.183 --> 28:01.117
Mrs. Fisk,

28:01.185 --> 28:04.954
right thumb
on the scanner, please.

28:15.065 --> 28:17.100
Have a great evening.

28:17.167 --> 28:20.937
Mr. Fisk, please.

28:32.983 --> 28:36.553
Is there a problem?

28:36.620 --> 28:39.322
Again, Mr. Fisk.

28:49.683 --> 28:51.667
Thank you, Mr. Fisk.
Absolutely.

28:51.719 --> 28:54.871
Thank you.

28:54.939 --> 28:57.874
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:35.012 --> 29:42.952
♪
♪

29:56.967 --> 29:59.035
There he is.

29:59.103 --> 30:01.070
You ready?

30:01.121 --> 30:03.172
Yeah.

30:03.240 --> 30:04.424
You better be.

30:07.044 --> 30:09.412
Hi.
Oh, it's good to see you.

30:09.463 --> 30:11.097
Thank you so much for coming.

30:11.181 --> 30:12.632
- So wonderful to see you well.
- Thank you.

30:12.716 --> 30:15.218
Thanks again,
thanks again for coming.

30:15.269 --> 30:18.087
All the best.
Thank you.

30:18.138 --> 30:20.940
Mr. Vice President,
Ted Fisk.

30:21.025 --> 30:24.093
This is a big honor.
Oh, Ted.

30:24.161 --> 30:25.445
It's my honor as well.

30:25.529 --> 30:27.697
And thank you
for your support.

30:27.765 --> 30:29.816
Oh, no--no--
no problem.

30:29.900 --> 30:33.036
Um...
This is my wife.

30:33.103 --> 30:35.154
Oh.
We've met.

30:39.343 --> 30:42.378
You do anything to signal
the Secret Service,

30:42.446 --> 30:44.130
and I pull the trigger.

30:44.214 --> 30:47.216
You'll be dead
before you get out a word.

30:47.284 --> 30:48.985
You might want to smile
and--and laugh

30:49.053 --> 30:51.754
like she just said
something charming.

30:51.805 --> 30:53.723
So...

30:53.791 --> 30:55.391
So it's nice
to have you here.

30:55.459 --> 30:56.659
Thank you.
Thank you.

30:56.727 --> 30:58.394
Uh, now you're gonna tell
your detail leader

30:58.462 --> 30:59.628
that you need a minute alone.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.631
Do it. Do it.

31:06.870 --> 31:09.572
J.R....

31:09.640 --> 31:11.307
I'm just going to need a moment
with my friends.

31:11.375 --> 31:13.643
- Yes, sir.
- Right this way.

31:13.711 --> 31:16.079
After you, sir.

31:16.146 --> 31:19.182
Apostle is headed
into a secured room.

31:19.249 --> 31:21.334
Keep your posts.

32:00.924 --> 32:03.075
What are you doing here?
What do you want?

32:03.160 --> 32:05.578
Ask him.

32:05.662 --> 32:09.432
You're gonna help me
take down James Dempsey.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.734
James Dempsey...

32:11.785 --> 32:13.402
Why are you asking me
about him?

32:13.470 --> 32:15.638
Don't--don't waste my time.
I know everything--

32:15.706 --> 32:18.174
that you helped Dempsey try
to assassinate the President.

32:18.242 --> 32:19.442
Oh, no, no,
it wasn't that simple.

32:19.510 --> 32:20.877
Okay, I don't care.
I don't care.

32:20.944 --> 32:24.714
I just want the proof
that will put him away.

32:24.782 --> 32:26.482
The last time I came forward
against Dempsey

32:26.550 --> 32:27.917
he almost killed me.

32:27.985 --> 32:31.287
And now he's threatening
my wife and children if I talk,

32:31.355 --> 32:35.191
besides which I have--
I don't have any proof,

32:35.258 --> 32:36.726
any actual proof.

32:36.777 --> 32:39.796
It's only my word against his.
There has to be something.

32:39.863 --> 32:44.333
There isn't.
Don't you understand?

32:44.401 --> 32:47.603
There isn't anything you
or anyone else can do!

32:47.671 --> 32:50.606
Hey!
Keep your voice down.

33:04.588 --> 33:06.722
Hello?
Is everything okay?

33:13.497 --> 33:16.148
Oh, my God!

33:16.233 --> 33:18.434
What happened?

33:18.485 --> 33:21.370
Who did this to you?
Call 911, please.

33:21.438 --> 33:23.406
Tell them the vice President's
in danger.

33:23.473 --> 33:26.943
You've got to know something
that we can use against him.

33:27.010 --> 33:30.580
I told you, there isn't.

33:30.647 --> 33:32.915
Well, then at least
tell us where he is.

33:32.983 --> 33:35.318
I told you, I don't know.

33:35.385 --> 33:37.336
And how much longer
do you think it'll be

33:37.421 --> 33:38.988
before they
come looking for me?

33:39.056 --> 33:42.124
He's right.
We don't have much time.

33:42.192 --> 33:44.660
Give me the gun.

33:48.181 --> 33:51.067
My name is Sean Walker.

33:51.134 --> 33:54.503
And the monster
that you're protecting

33:54.571 --> 33:57.907
has hurt and killed
who knows how many people.

33:57.975 --> 33:58.975
He's framed me for murder.

33:59.026 --> 34:02.311
Because of him,
I've lost everything

34:02.362 --> 34:04.580
and everyone
that I care about.

34:04.648 --> 34:08.351
So right now
I have nothing to lose.

34:09.652 --> 34:12.221
So you're gonna give me
something

34:12.289 --> 34:15.408
that will help
take Dempsey down,

34:15.492 --> 34:18.928
or I will put
a bullet in your head.

34:18.996 --> 34:21.030
You understand?

34:21.081 --> 34:22.931
Do you?

34:23.000 --> 34:25.701
Huh?
All right. Okay. All right.

34:25.768 --> 34:28.054
- What?
- He's left the country.

34:28.138 --> 34:29.204
Uh-huh.
Go on.

34:29.255 --> 34:30.806
He--he left for France
this morning.

34:30.873 --> 34:31.908
That's it--France?

34:31.975 --> 34:33.576
Somewhere
in the Jura Mountains.

34:33.643 --> 34:35.377
That's all I know.
I swear.

34:35.429 --> 34:38.514
A call just came in.
We have a security breach.

34:38.565 --> 34:40.266
Harden up
around the V.P. now.

34:40.350 --> 34:43.886
We've got a potential imminent
threat against Apostle.

34:43.954 --> 34:46.237
What's he doing there?

34:46.322 --> 34:47.489
I don't know.

34:47.556 --> 34:50.426
Please, leave me.

34:50.494 --> 34:52.295
Mr. Vice President.
Open the door, sir.

34:52.362 --> 34:55.063
We need to go...
Now!

34:58.085 --> 34:59.502
He's not responding.

34:59.569 --> 35:01.504
Stand back.

35:03.624 --> 35:05.508
Mr. Vice President,
are you all right?

35:05.575 --> 35:07.093
Yeah, they're getting away--
that way!

35:23.924 --> 35:26.426
Sophia arrived
at Union Station 20 minutes ago.

35:26.477 --> 35:27.527
Do we have even a guess

35:27.594 --> 35:29.095
as to where
she could be headed?

35:29.146 --> 35:30.530
No, I'm afraid not.

35:30.597 --> 35:33.166
There's no indication
she knows she's being followed.

35:33.234 --> 35:35.535
So whatever's going on,

35:35.603 --> 35:38.872
she should lead us
right to it.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.980
Sophia is here.

35:48.382 --> 35:50.050
She's reached
her destination.

35:50.117 --> 35:52.618
- What do we know about it?
- St. Andrew's Cathedral--

35:52.670 --> 35:54.721
it's been vacant for years.
According to the record,

35:54.789 --> 35:56.890
it was bought by a developer
six months ago.

35:56.957 --> 35:58.224
All right,
I want to know who,

35:58.292 --> 36:00.060
and I want schematics on it
and every other building

36:00.127 --> 36:01.394
within ten city blocks
right away.

36:01.462 --> 36:02.462
Yes, sir.

36:02.530 --> 36:05.932
- Devon.
- Carlos.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.735
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

36:08.802 --> 36:10.520
It's been a long time.

36:10.604 --> 36:11.938
Can we tell
how many people are in it?

36:12.006 --> 36:13.840
Just a few moments,
Mr. President.

36:13.908 --> 36:16.659
Splitting satellite feed
to infrared.

36:22.416 --> 36:25.702
I'm picking up
about 200 heat signatures.

36:25.786 --> 36:27.520
You were right.

36:27.588 --> 36:28.988
They're meeting.

36:29.056 --> 36:31.124
Move your men
into position, General.

36:31.175 --> 36:33.543
This is your new target.

36:37.565 --> 36:40.033
Hello, Thomas.

36:40.101 --> 36:43.570
Mother...
I'm glad you came.

36:43.637 --> 36:46.172
You too, Michael.

36:46.223 --> 36:50.844
I'd like to speak to you
about this privately first.

36:50.911 --> 36:52.695
No.

36:52.780 --> 36:55.548
No more secrets.

36:55.616 --> 36:58.184
We should get started.

37:01.489 --> 37:03.690
Alpha team, how long
before you're in position?

37:03.758 --> 37:06.242
- Good news, Mr. President.
- What is it?

37:06.327 --> 37:08.545
This is archival footage
from a closed-circuit camera

37:08.629 --> 37:10.547
outside the church.
I don't understand.

37:10.631 --> 37:12.832
What am I looking at?
That man there...

37:12.883 --> 37:14.167
That's Thomas.

37:14.218 --> 37:16.870
He's inside the church
right now.

37:23.511 --> 37:26.713
You all know my mother
and I have had our differences.

37:26.781 --> 37:29.482
Well, the reason
why I brought you today

37:29.550 --> 37:32.018
is to tell you
that we can't afford to be

37:32.086 --> 37:34.387
at odds with each other
any longer.

37:36.490 --> 37:38.691
The message
I recently sent home

37:38.742 --> 37:41.594
has been answered.

37:41.662 --> 37:43.896
And the response
is not one

37:43.948 --> 37:46.666
that any of us
will want to hear.

37:46.734 --> 37:49.619
We've all known
for some time

37:49.703 --> 37:52.238
that our planet's days
were numbered.

37:52.306 --> 37:56.609
Unfortunately,
our calculations were wrong.

37:56.677 --> 37:59.546
According
to the message I received,

37:59.613 --> 38:02.315
our Sun has started
going supernova.

38:06.687 --> 38:09.622
I know this
is much, much sooner

38:09.690 --> 38:11.524
than we'd anticipated.

38:11.592 --> 38:12.926
But it is happening.

38:12.993 --> 38:14.994
The first wave
of lethal gamma rays

38:15.062 --> 38:19.666
will reach our solar system
in the next two weeks.

38:19.733 --> 38:22.635
In less than a year,

38:22.703 --> 38:26.206
our planet
will be uninhabitable.

38:26.273 --> 38:27.440
And if we don't migrate,

38:27.491 --> 38:31.778
our civilization
will cease to exist.

38:31.846 --> 38:33.680
My plan to bring thousands
of our people here

38:33.747 --> 38:35.481
is now obsolete.

38:41.839 --> 38:43.223
I have visual.

38:43.290 --> 38:45.124
One guard at church entrance.
Roger that.

38:50.731 --> 38:54.601
The only choice we have now
is to bring everyone here...

38:54.668 --> 38:58.338
To make this place our home.

38:58.405 --> 39:02.325
This planet is the only chance
we have of survival.

39:02.409 --> 39:05.845
And we're gonna seize it
before it's too late.

39:35.676 --> 39:39.228
- We have a big problem.
