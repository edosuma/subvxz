00:36.457 --> 00:39.312
In The Beginning

00:51.450 --> 00:54.695
Based on a true story

01:07.267 --> 01:10.159
Construction of a hypermarket

01:12.671 --> 01:17.636
This is RPC.
We deal in office equipment.

01:18.181 --> 01:22.329
Could I have the name
of your Logistics Manager

01:22.761 --> 01:23.933
to send a catalogue?

01:25.481 --> 01:28.886
Mr Miller... with 2 Ls.
Philippe Miller.

01:29.556 --> 01:32.026
Can I ask who your supplier is

01:32.161 --> 01:34.563
for equipment rental?

01:34.899 --> 01:36.095
Point P, OK.

01:41.246 --> 01:44.549
Hello.
I work with Philippe Miller from CGI

01:44.686 --> 01:47.784
on the construction
of the hypermarket near Caudry.

01:48.194 --> 01:51.257
Mrs Blondel gave me your name.

01:51.902 --> 01:57.072
We need a tacheometer.
A GTS 239.

01:57.647 --> 01:58.647
You got one?

02:24.834 --> 02:26.133
Your surveyor know this one?

02:26.305 --> 02:27.898
Yeah, I think so.

02:28.241 --> 02:31.112
- When will you return it?
- End of the week.

02:32.283 --> 02:33.809
Can you sign for it?

02:41.202 --> 02:42.261
I'll be right back.

03:05.984 --> 03:09.219
200 for the monitors,
500 for the instrument, OK?

03:18.811 --> 03:20.678
These are a big hit.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.277
I bought 'em

03:22.585 --> 03:23.747
in Slovakia.

03:23.889 --> 03:25.824
They're rolling in it.

03:29.734 --> 03:30.861
Fake pay slips.

03:31.270 --> 03:33.263
I sell 'em to illegal aliens

03:33.975 --> 03:35.137
along with rent slips.

03:35.678 --> 03:37.170
So they can draw benefit.

03:37.950 --> 03:39.681
It sells well.

05:04.793 --> 05:08.494
Hello. This is BBL.
We rent office equipment.

05:09.068 --> 05:13.270
Can I have the name
of your Logistics Manager?

05:14.112 --> 05:15.112
Mr...?

05:15.281 --> 05:16.700
Sorry, it's noisy in my office.

05:17.185 --> 05:18.209
Thank you, ma'am.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.605
Construction of Highway 61a

06:13.264 --> 06:15.288
There were beetles everywhere.

06:15.427 --> 06:18.234
So, the ecologists got
the construction stopped.

06:18.688 --> 06:21.330
They staged demonstrations.
It was pretty scary.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.302
Are you from CGI, too?

06:27.081 --> 06:29.141
A guy from your firm
came last year.

06:30.752 --> 06:33.814
He met with all the people
who'd lost their jobs.

06:34.591 --> 06:36.526
He left and never came back.

06:36.727 --> 06:38.457
I think it scared him.

06:38.796 --> 06:40.230
Where can I buy cigarettes?

06:41.199 --> 06:43.191
It's too late now around here.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.164
I can help you out.

06:48.944 --> 06:51.675
- Thanks. Here...
- It's OK, keep them.

06:52.515 --> 06:54.779
I'm Monika. Goodnight.

06:56.153 --> 06:58.053
You don't need anything else?

06:59.558 --> 07:02.756
Oh, yes, there's a wedding,
so it may be a bit noisy.

07:05.599 --> 07:06.998
That's all he said?

07:07.201 --> 07:09.192
He said he's here
for the road works.

07:11.539 --> 07:12.539
Shit!

07:12.909 --> 07:14.137
Give me a hand here.

07:15.211 --> 07:16.577
Tonight's my night off.

07:16.713 --> 07:19.308
Lots of girls
would jump at the chance.

07:19.851 --> 07:21.716
- Put it back.
- It's gross!

07:21.886 --> 07:25.516
You're the one who cleans the floor!
Go on, get in there.

07:26.459 --> 07:29.588
And don't sulk.
It has nothing to do with the guests.

08:09.683 --> 08:11.116
I don't believe this!

08:11.452 --> 08:12.452
What the hell!

08:12.786 --> 08:14.414
You had stuff stolen, too?

08:14.622 --> 08:18.856
And they've wrecked the door.
Oh, I don't believe it!

08:19.063 --> 08:20.324
What about your car?

08:20.564 --> 08:21.998
Same here.

08:22.367 --> 08:23.699
- Come on.
- I'll join you.

09:03.054 --> 09:06.355
Reception here.
There are 2 people to see you.

09:08.261 --> 09:09.990
Did they say who they are?

09:10.798 --> 09:12.732
I'm not pressing charges.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.661
Should I ask if

09:14.803 --> 09:15.803
it's the police?

09:18.274 --> 09:19.332
I'm coming.

10:00.663 --> 10:03.997
The 2 gentlemen
are in the dining room.

10:07.204 --> 10:08.832
Go straight through.

10:17.485 --> 10:18.508
Hello.

10:20.455 --> 10:21.945
Do you have 5 minutes?

10:24.360 --> 10:25.521
For a coffee.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.641
- What can I get you?
- A coffee.

10:41.483 --> 10:44.510
The manager of this place
is an old friend.

10:44.788 --> 10:47.883
He told us
you arrived last night.

10:49.494 --> 10:53.454
We decided
to come and see you directly.

10:57.737 --> 10:58.898
Patrick and I

10:59.273 --> 11:03.802
run a tool rental company here.

11:05.614 --> 11:08.710
Since the work stopped 2 years ago,

11:09.453 --> 11:13.289
we've had a really rough time.

11:15.395 --> 11:18.887
We thought we had a chance
of getting the contract.

11:19.366 --> 11:21.734
We got into debt
to buy new machines,

11:21.869 --> 11:25.203
hire drivers, mechanics...

11:26.509 --> 11:28.842
And at the last moment,
your predecessor

11:29.580 --> 11:32.140
chose our rivals.

11:32.283 --> 11:34.913
It was a disaster for us, of course.

11:35.554 --> 11:37.318
Later on, we understood.

11:38.125 --> 11:41.253
The site manager
worked in a rather...

11:43.698 --> 11:46.258
He wanted something from us
he didn't get,

11:46.668 --> 11:48.501
so we didn't do business.

11:48.739 --> 11:52.471
He expected a pretty big "'discount" '.

11:53.345 --> 11:57.544
So, if the work does restart,
we don't want to lose out again.

11:59.253 --> 12:00.345
Sure.

12:01.422 --> 12:04.187
We'd be prepared to go
as far as 15%/% "'discount" '.

12:06.195 --> 12:07.389
15%/%?

12:07.864 --> 12:09.730
15%/% of the total amount.

12:11.101 --> 12:12.797
That's a tidy sum in cash.

12:13.771 --> 12:15.798
But it's up to you to tell us...

12:18.644 --> 12:19.873
I see you've met.

12:20.179 --> 12:22.239
We were discussing the beetles.

12:22.884 --> 12:24.351
What a nightmare!

12:25.253 --> 12:28.155
Those little beetles
decimated the whole region.

12:28.791 --> 12:29.791
Thanks.

12:31.294 --> 12:35.164
It's only that big,
but it's wiped out hundreds of jobs.

12:36.469 --> 12:38.733
So, how long are you staying?

12:39.873 --> 12:41.306
A day or two, no more.

12:41.542 --> 12:42.702
You're just...

12:43.444 --> 12:44.912
Just doing a status report.

12:45.213 --> 12:48.274
That's something,
'cause they never cleaned up. See it?

12:48.617 --> 12:49.617
Yeah.

12:50.619 --> 12:52.281
Is your room alright?

12:52.556 --> 12:54.422
Not too much noise last night?

12:54.726 --> 12:56.353
Sorry about your car.

12:56.694 --> 12:57.694
It's only a window.

12:58.864 --> 13:01.095
We'll leave you our card.

13:02.435 --> 13:03.767
I'll add the cell number.

14:48.175 --> 14:49.175
Hi.

14:50.778 --> 14:52.336
I owe you these.

14:52.615 --> 14:53.673
No need.

14:59.490 --> 15:00.490
Time for a coffee?

15:01.292 --> 15:02.521
5 minutes?

15:06.431 --> 15:08.297
You work on Sundays, too?

15:08.568 --> 15:09.568
Sometimes.

15:10.604 --> 15:11.867
Been out and about?

15:13.375 --> 15:15.367
- Coffee, please.
- Same here.

15:16.112 --> 15:17.170
Normally, there are

15:17.346 --> 15:18.745
less people at the fair.

15:20.684 --> 15:21.684
He won't stop crying.

15:23.121 --> 15:24.612
Philippe - Nicolas and Esteban.

15:25.223 --> 15:26.223
Hello.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.730
- Try the carousel.
- Too busy.

15:29.863 --> 15:31.627
- Not seen Corinne?
- No.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.527
I'll go, then.

15:34.336 --> 15:35.531
Go with Mommy.

15:36.506 --> 15:39.202
See you later.
You staying here? Back soon.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.168
Can I sit here?

15:49.389 --> 15:52.153
There were some things
in the car I want back.

15:53.460 --> 15:54.655
The fake phone cards?

15:55.763 --> 15:57.322
Can't even sell 'em.

15:58.300 --> 15:59.460
You tried?

16:00.537 --> 16:01.799
You a cop?

16:02.872 --> 16:04.397
You afraid of cops?

16:06.377 --> 16:07.436
And you?

16:10.950 --> 16:12.350
You're the talk of the town.

16:13.822 --> 16:15.756
That you're here for the highway.

16:16.926 --> 16:18.188
They don't waste any time.

16:18.327 --> 16:22.162
Not with 25%/% unemployment here,
they don't.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.226
I can't find Corinne.

16:25.703 --> 16:26.897
Let's go, then.

16:27.873 --> 16:29.135
To the carousel?

16:29.875 --> 16:31.241
I'll get this.

16:31.378 --> 16:32.777
I owe you that much.

16:38.754 --> 16:41.622
Hello. Mr Miller from CGI here.

16:41.758 --> 16:43.589
We met at the hotel earlier on.

16:44.194 --> 16:46.253
I've thought it over.

16:46.765 --> 16:49.290
Yes, you know, our agreement.

16:50.169 --> 16:52.228
The money in cash...

16:53.305 --> 16:56.902
I have to leave tonight for Lille.

16:57.579 --> 17:00.605
Is tonight not possible?
Tomorrow morning?

17:01.183 --> 17:02.183
OK...

17:05.589 --> 17:06.646
Very well.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.689
Is it working?

17:13.165 --> 17:14.531
Can you hear me?

17:16.470 --> 17:19.929
First of all, some cars
are badly parked.

17:20.241 --> 17:22.368
They're blocking the road.

17:22.511 --> 17:24.502
Please move them as soon as possible.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.212
Hello, everyone.

17:26.415 --> 17:27.849
Thank you for coming...

17:28.486 --> 17:30.511
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

17:31.690 --> 17:34.625
This year, the Town Hall
has joined forces

17:34.761 --> 17:37.696
with the neighboring towns

17:37.964 --> 17:42.301
for the raffle
to raise money for the elderly.

17:46.210 --> 17:48.838
Let's now see
what the children have been up to.

17:49.414 --> 17:52.543
This year, they were asked to create

17:52.685 --> 17:56.747
costumes made entirely
from recyclable materials.

17:57.558 --> 18:00.220
The winner of this competition

18:00.361 --> 18:03.593
who will be known
as the Recycling King - or Queen -

18:04.299 --> 18:06.894
will win a CD player
provided by the Town Hall.

18:08.773 --> 18:12.540
The kids will come up one at a time.
Give them a big hand.

18:29.467 --> 18:31.901
- Some mulled wine.
- Thanks.

18:32.037 --> 18:33.470
It's not great!

18:35.875 --> 18:37.570
Did you reach an agreement?

18:39.313 --> 18:40.678
We'll see.

18:41.482 --> 18:44.351
They're good guys.
You'll come to an understanding.

18:52.330 --> 18:53.388
This is Mr Miller.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.028
You're eagerly awaited, you know.

18:57.703 --> 18:58.898
He arrived last night.

18:59.039 --> 19:01.303
I'm fully aware of that.
I'm StĂ©phane.

19:04.445 --> 19:06.108
Let's go somewhere quieter.

19:07.984 --> 19:09.953
People look happy, don't they?

19:10.087 --> 19:11.850
If I tell them who you are,

19:12.490 --> 19:14.458
they'll ask you to go on stage.

19:15.060 --> 19:17.086
Should I tell them? No?

19:17.396 --> 19:18.590
They won't eat you!

19:21.870 --> 19:23.030
Let's go to the Town Hall.

19:23.171 --> 19:24.502
I'll tell Michel.

19:28.510 --> 19:29.842
I'll shut the door.

19:29.979 --> 19:31.642
Sit yourself down.

19:32.650 --> 19:33.650
We do weddings here.

19:33.885 --> 19:35.113
Don't be scared!

19:35.487 --> 19:37.887
We're really pleased to see you.

19:38.023 --> 19:40.458
So, you're here to do a status report?

19:40.693 --> 19:41.717
That's right.

19:42.028 --> 19:44.497
OK. And what exactly does that mean?

19:46.868 --> 19:48.461
I meet people...

19:50.072 --> 19:52.974
I see how things are going.

19:54.612 --> 19:55.909
Try to see clearly...

19:57.049 --> 19:58.175
That kinda thing.

19:58.717 --> 20:01.778
They didn't tell us 2 years ago
that work would stop.

20:01.922 --> 20:05.017
Now they don't tell us it might restart.
Very strange.

20:05.993 --> 20:07.427
I understand.

20:08.263 --> 20:12.257
Well, I do what I'm told.
You know, it's...

20:12.568 --> 20:13.865
You mustn't...

20:14.738 --> 20:16.297
What are you told?

20:19.512 --> 20:20.979
To come and see how...

20:23.683 --> 20:27.587
in what condition the site is in...
To meet people...

20:29.424 --> 20:30.756
Have you seen the site?

20:31.026 --> 20:32.791
Of course.

20:32.929 --> 20:34.659
There was the drainage problem.

20:35.900 --> 20:39.030
It's not building land, so that's...

20:39.605 --> 20:41.539
That's nothing to worry about.

20:41.674 --> 20:42.801
It's not a problem.

20:43.609 --> 20:46.101
In any case,
they haven't forgotten us.

20:46.347 --> 20:47.405
That's good.

20:48.616 --> 20:50.550
- No...
- So, there's hope.

20:56.259 --> 20:58.194
I'm afraid I can't stay.

20:58.328 --> 20:59.328
We've had to

20:59.464 --> 21:02.799
provide access for the farmers
who work the land.

21:03.435 --> 21:04.767
Don't forget the farmers.

21:05.438 --> 21:08.408
Could you take
the new plans back with you?

21:08.676 --> 21:10.473
I'll go get the copies.

21:12.848 --> 21:13.873
I'm sorry...

21:14.250 --> 21:16.947
but I really can't stay.

21:17.422 --> 21:18.855
How can we reach you?

21:19.524 --> 21:20.753
Can you leave your card?

21:20.892 --> 21:24.887
I have nothing on me.
Someone broke into my car last night.

21:25.932 --> 21:27.457
I'm very sorry.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.569
We don't know how to contact you.

21:29.704 --> 21:31.672
Are you staying in the area?

21:33.943 --> 21:36.707
Philippe, can't you go after him?

21:37.681 --> 21:39.342
- He's gone?
- Yes.

21:40.752 --> 21:43.950
He just follows orders.
He's not in charge.

21:45.725 --> 21:47.956
He can't say too much, but

21:48.796 --> 21:50.355
he's here for a reason.

21:50.631 --> 21:53.624
They could at least send
someone competent.

21:53.836 --> 21:56.828
Maybe there are things he can't tell us.

21:57.007 --> 21:59.943
The jerk was lost for words.

22:00.278 --> 22:02.770
Don't say that.
You sound like a tribunal.

22:03.015 --> 22:04.482
Where's he come from?

22:04.617 --> 22:08.315
He's from Head Office,
but he does look lost.

22:08.456 --> 22:13.588
He seems very dull,
unable to string a sentence together.

22:13.995 --> 22:15.724
A bit pathetic.

22:17.434 --> 22:18.991
- Got anything else?
- No.

22:21.672 --> 22:24.734
I want to ask you something.
I know it's not done...

22:27.480 --> 22:28.675
It's my rĂ©sumĂ©.

22:30.717 --> 22:33.084
I thought
you might be hiring people.

22:34.789 --> 22:36.451
Times are hard.

22:36.592 --> 22:38.083
You did 3 years at college?

22:38.527 --> 22:40.519
Yeah, I'm still refunding the loan.

22:40.865 --> 22:43.027
I got a technical sales diploma.

22:43.335 --> 22:46.362
Then, I did some bookkeeping
in a garage.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.063
Why stay in this hole?

22:48.641 --> 22:50.633
It didn't use to be a hole.

22:50.911 --> 22:54.973
And I was born here,
and there's Nicolas and the kid...

22:56.685 --> 22:59.382
I'm not going to move
to go in search of work

22:59.823 --> 23:01.085
or we'll all live in China.

23:02.125 --> 23:04.561
And I work in the sugar refinery

23:04.897 --> 23:07.593
during the beet harvest.

23:08.100 --> 23:10.968
I just do shitty jobs
in shopping malls and such.

23:11.739 --> 23:12.899
That's life.

23:16.076 --> 23:17.806
You coming down for dinner?

23:17.946 --> 23:19.676
No, I have work to do.

23:20.082 --> 23:21.082
I can bring something.

23:21.217 --> 23:22.378
I'm not hungry.

23:23.153 --> 23:24.882
You won't mention my rĂ©sumĂ©?

23:25.891 --> 23:26.891
Don't worry.

23:27.927 --> 23:28.927
Goodnight.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.128
There'll be more next time.

23:45.416 --> 23:47.476
- How much is there?
- 5,000.

23:47.619 --> 23:49.883
It's all we could get so fast.

23:50.156 --> 23:51.784
Is that OK for now?

23:52.391 --> 23:53.620
That's OK.

23:53.660 --> 23:55.993
Here's a list of our equipment.

23:56.297 --> 23:59.324
It corresponds
to what was needed last time.

24:00.669 --> 24:02.900
We can give you
further info by phone.

24:03.038 --> 24:04.097
I'll phone you.

24:04.541 --> 24:07.010
Sorry about yesterday.
It wasn't very...

24:07.578 --> 24:09.047
But people here suffered.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.715
If every supplier does this,

24:14.855 --> 24:16.914
you'll rake in a small fortune.

24:21.964 --> 24:25.958
Here are details of a friend
who rents vans.

24:26.103 --> 24:28.538
He's open to discussion, too.

24:29.874 --> 24:31.137
Keep in touch.

24:44.494 --> 24:46.087
That guy left this for you.

24:59.514 --> 25:01.380
Why did he give you that?

25:01.517 --> 25:03.782
I don't know.
They didn't charge him...

25:05.522 --> 25:06.682
D'you sleep with him?

25:10.729 --> 25:12.026
We need the money.

25:21.743 --> 25:22.801
No, I didn't.

25:26.083 --> 25:27.812
Not everyone is a slimeball.

25:30.455 --> 25:31.683
Yeah, sure!

25:47.311 --> 25:48.334
Mr Miller?

25:49.713 --> 25:51.374
I was not impressed.

25:51.616 --> 25:53.675
- I...
- Who d'you think you are?

25:54.487 --> 25:58.185
People like you...
think you can judge me!

25:58.592 --> 25:59.650
Listen.

26:00.461 --> 26:02.929
I travel a lot.
I meet a lot of people.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.227
People like you are alone.

26:06.870 --> 26:08.427
You look all alone.

26:17.583 --> 26:19.609
Mr Miller, please don't go.

26:19.954 --> 26:21.421
I'm just a jerk!

26:21.555 --> 26:24.548
- Don't go.
- Ajerk, isn't that right?

26:50.026 --> 26:51.584
He was sleeping.

26:52.729 --> 26:54.789
Thanks, Corinne. I'm sorry.

26:56.434 --> 26:57.434
Is Nicolas home?

26:59.537 --> 27:00.869
He's not back...

27:02.410 --> 27:03.638
I'll stay with you.

27:04.011 --> 27:05.410
Go to sleep now.

27:14.525 --> 27:17.290
One day, the cops
will find him dead somewhere.

27:17.696 --> 27:19.358
He has good shit though!

27:20.366 --> 27:21.924
That's the problem.

27:22.936 --> 27:24.597
Yeah, that's the problem!

27:26.808 --> 27:31.075
Don't worry, we'll build that highway
and get the hell outta here.

27:34.818 --> 27:36.377
To highways!

27:52.309 --> 27:56.246
Initially, I just need to establish
a base to prepare things.

27:56.514 --> 27:57.514
A base?

27:57.582 --> 27:59.517
You mean a platform
at the entrance

27:59.651 --> 28:02.018
to store the machines,
equipment, etc?

28:02.322 --> 28:03.721
Yeah, a platform.

28:04.591 --> 28:08.586
Do you have the plans
or should we use the old ones?

28:08.830 --> 28:11.458
- We should go take a look.
- Sure.

28:12.034 --> 28:13.366
Ah, the coffee!

28:14.604 --> 28:16.903
What's the link between CGI and you?

28:17.041 --> 28:19.977
I know they keep
adding subsidiaries, but...

28:20.545 --> 28:22.479
It all belongs to CGI.

28:23.015 --> 28:25.849
You have agreements
with the holding company.

28:26.887 --> 28:30.655
My associates and I try
to have a structure

28:30.793 --> 28:32.385
that's flexible enough

28:32.862 --> 28:35.922
to let us stay in touch
with grass-roots reality.

28:36.566 --> 28:38.296
You're not GTM?

28:38.436 --> 28:39.733
You're GMT.

28:40.539 --> 28:42.905
GMT R. "'R"' for "'roads"'.

28:44.611 --> 28:46.511
Jamel handles schedules.

28:49.451 --> 28:51.419
CGI has 1,700 subsidiaries

28:51.786 --> 28:54.551
with branches all over the world.

28:56.058 --> 28:57.686
And it keeps changing.

28:58.328 --> 28:59.727
They asked me to do this,

28:59.863 --> 29:01.695
among other things.

29:02.634 --> 29:03.896
It's a tough task.

29:04.035 --> 29:05.970
But we're here to help.

29:06.572 --> 29:08.598
But civil engineering in France

29:08.742 --> 29:11.405
is a headache
for companies like ours.

29:11.980 --> 29:15.109
It's true,
it's so closely monitored nowadays.

29:15.418 --> 29:18.115
In fact, we lose money on it.

29:18.756 --> 29:19.916
Is that right?

29:20.859 --> 29:23.327
We don't know
about that kind of thing.

29:23.461 --> 29:25.453
We're just struggling to survive.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.867
What about your equipment needs?

29:28.468 --> 29:30.129
We'll need a copy

29:30.437 --> 29:32.030
of the schedule asap.

29:33.408 --> 29:36.003
First, I want to see
your estimation.

29:36.145 --> 29:38.410
You must have quotes and plans?

29:38.548 --> 29:40.414
Here you are.

29:41.584 --> 29:44.053
If you need more equipment,
we'll manage.

29:44.755 --> 29:45.755
OK.

29:45.924 --> 29:50.761
But in the meantime,
how do we get in touch with you?

29:51.031 --> 29:53.625
We don't have a thing.
Do you have a card?

29:56.972 --> 29:59.373
Look at the state
it was delivered in.

29:59.609 --> 30:02.374
Let's call Michel -
he'll reprint it in no time.

30:02.513 --> 30:05.038
He'll be interested
in working with you.

30:05.484 --> 30:07.076
He can reuse the logo.

30:07.486 --> 30:09.512
What're you doing
for lunch, Mr Miller?

30:10.958 --> 30:12.049
Call me Philippe.

30:25.076 --> 30:26.167
This is it.

30:28.581 --> 30:31.414
It was a packaging firm.

30:31.784 --> 30:33.912
Now it belongs to the town,

30:34.054 --> 30:37.684
but we can't afford to refurbish it.

30:38.594 --> 30:40.791
The site isn't far. I thought...

30:41.031 --> 30:43.727
I don't know what you need.

30:44.903 --> 30:46.803
It's not too run-down.

30:48.974 --> 30:52.502
Even a kitchen...
We'll help you clean up.

30:54.448 --> 30:57.145
I'll see to the power
and insurance.

30:58.453 --> 31:00.012
Why did they leave?

31:00.156 --> 31:02.853
They relocated to Croatia.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.391
Can't you do anything?

31:05.763 --> 31:07.594
What can we do?

31:07.865 --> 31:12.064
Near here, there was
a textiles factory. 800 jobs.

31:12.505 --> 31:16.499
The boss went to India
with the machines and our subsidies.

31:17.111 --> 31:20.138
We're left with the jobless.

31:25.455 --> 31:26.980
I phoned your office.

31:27.759 --> 31:28.919
They didn't tell me.

31:30.095 --> 31:31.927
They couldn't find you.

31:33.133 --> 31:35.124
I have little contact with them.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.901
I said I was a mayor
concerned by the project.

31:39.240 --> 31:42.870
I just got
one voice mail after another.

31:43.011 --> 31:44.036
Happens all the time.

31:44.180 --> 31:45.670
Especially with me.

31:45.815 --> 31:48.580
We tried in vain
to sue them 2 years ago.

31:54.627 --> 31:56.720
The main thing is, you're back.

31:59.634 --> 32:02.968
You have to give priority
to local firms.

32:03.739 --> 32:06.470
The suppliers, hotels...
I'm counting on you.

32:06.710 --> 32:08.110
Going well, isn't it?

32:08.746 --> 32:09.804
Just fine.

32:11.183 --> 32:12.674
They've suffered.

32:13.552 --> 32:14.713
I know.

32:15.623 --> 32:16.623
You know...

32:16.956 --> 32:18.584
Call me on this number.

32:19.026 --> 32:20.050
There you are.

32:23.666 --> 32:27.535
The CGI's offices were 15 miles away.
We never saw them.

32:27.838 --> 32:30.204
People will be reassured
that you're here.

32:32.544 --> 32:33.567
See you soon.

32:34.747 --> 32:36.647
- Call me, OK?
- Sure.

33:06.889 --> 33:07.889
ACCOUNTS

33:12.964 --> 33:14.261
Hi, how are you?

33:16.669 --> 33:17.669
He hired you?

33:17.737 --> 33:21.104
I don't know. We're helping out
for now, then we'll see.

33:22.176 --> 33:25.874
So, with the drivers,
that makes a team of 34 people.

33:26.248 --> 33:27.909
Here are their rĂ©sumĂ©s.

33:29.085 --> 33:33.251
We could have a global wages contract
with payment at 90 days.

33:33.391 --> 33:34.416
Then, we'll see.

33:34.560 --> 33:37.052
What can you give me on that?

33:38.897 --> 33:40.866
Patrick said your rate is 15%/%.

33:42.069 --> 33:44.664
Can you get it by Friday?

33:46.508 --> 33:47.669
In cash?

33:52.449 --> 33:54.918
The more people you hire,

33:55.052 --> 33:58.216
the higher the commission

33:58.657 --> 34:00.056
for both of us?

34:00.593 --> 34:01.593
Of course.

34:06.267 --> 34:09.795
We need people to direct
heavy vehicles at junctions.

34:10.172 --> 34:12.539
You need to contact
the agency direct.

34:12.674 --> 34:13.699
Sorry...

34:17.014 --> 34:20.076
The Town Hall asked him
to hire locals,

34:20.219 --> 34:21.619
so try your luck.

34:22.054 --> 34:23.489
What do you do?

34:23.625 --> 34:27.117
I'm a driver, but I'm not sure
I want to do it.

34:32.101 --> 34:35.038
Hello, this is GMTR
about the work resuming.

34:35.839 --> 34:37.705
Mr Miller asked me to call you

34:37.842 --> 34:40.574
to draw up the rental contracts.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.976
It's payment at 90 days.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.639
No, not 30 days.

34:45.485 --> 34:47.512
Yes, Mr Miller spoke to them.

34:55.063 --> 34:58.867
Rosemonde here will be helping out.
She's a retired secretary.

34:59.772 --> 35:01.536
I thought she'd be useful.

35:01.740 --> 35:03.709
Have you worked in construction?

35:03.944 --> 35:05.241
Yes, a bit.

35:07.982 --> 35:09.040
Thank you, sir.

35:09.083 --> 35:12.077
This is your desk.
All the papers are here.

35:12.489 --> 35:14.719
- Who's his foreman?
- The one in charge.

35:15.192 --> 35:17.217
- There's just temps.
- That's weird.

35:18.162 --> 35:20.154
I won't give him 10%/% in advance.

35:20.465 --> 35:22.661
Nor me.
I got taken for a ride before.

35:25.806 --> 35:28.001
I'll pick up the contract
from your office.

35:30.778 --> 35:31.802
Nice car...

35:35.284 --> 35:36.912
I've been loaned it for now.

35:37.554 --> 35:39.021
Why for now?

35:56.746 --> 35:58.180
Can you sign these?

35:59.684 --> 36:02.915
And who do I call
to get the company checkbooks?

36:03.221 --> 36:04.553
They'll be here.

36:06.693 --> 36:09.162
Do I call the agency for an advance?

36:09.664 --> 36:12.724
I don't deal with that.
The agency writes the checks.

36:24.216 --> 36:25.216
Thanks.

36:26.353 --> 36:28.150
No need for a tie.

36:46.345 --> 36:47.779
I'm meeting Mr Miller.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.939
Are you the foreman?

36:50.083 --> 36:51.847
- Louis.
- Nicolas.

36:51.986 --> 36:53.112
Is he here?

36:54.121 --> 36:55.214
Over there.

36:59.796 --> 37:02.993
We're better off here
than where they were 2 years ago.

37:03.301 --> 37:06.999
We'll get the Town Hall
to redirect the minor road.

37:10.944 --> 37:13.506
Never worked with GMTR.
Where were you before?

37:15.450 --> 37:16.974
Drop the chitchat, OK?

37:18.588 --> 37:19.680
Whatever you say.

37:20.591 --> 37:22.786
I spent a long time abroad.

37:26.031 --> 37:28.796
Tell us what to do
or I'll make suggestions.

37:28.933 --> 37:29.993
Fine by me.

38:03.113 --> 38:05.241
Hurry up, we're running late.

38:05.983 --> 38:07.143
More champagne!

38:07.853 --> 38:10.048
- Where's the boss?
- He'll be here.

38:17.565 --> 38:18.931
What's going on?

38:19.134 --> 38:21.296
They're getting ready for Monday.

38:21.971 --> 38:23.939
They're giving you a warm welcome.

38:28.847 --> 38:30.144
It's party time!

38:50.609 --> 38:52.133
Speech! Speech!

39:08.899 --> 39:11.198
I'm not very good at making speeches.

39:13.238 --> 39:14.238
A big thank you...

39:17.210 --> 39:18.509
to the suppliers.

39:25.721 --> 39:27.280
And also...

39:29.727 --> 39:30.921
that...

39:32.063 --> 39:35.124
I just want to say thank you
to Mr Miller

39:35.267 --> 39:37.793
for all he's done for us,

39:38.138 --> 39:39.628
for the local firms...

39:40.575 --> 39:44.842
Since work stopped 2 years ago,
things have been hard.

39:45.547 --> 39:48.108
Many of you felt abandoned

39:48.284 --> 39:50.583
and were losing hope.

39:50.721 --> 39:53.953
Now you've found fresh hope

39:54.092 --> 39:56.891
and you feel, as I do,
that there is a path,

39:57.096 --> 39:59.292
a way... a highway!

40:00.133 --> 40:01.829
You get there quicker!

40:02.605 --> 40:06.042
And it'll lead us to a better future.

40:06.910 --> 40:09.538
A road is always the start
of an adventure.

40:10.013 --> 40:13.610
And I hope that this second chance
will be the right one.

40:17.624 --> 40:19.320
To second chances!

40:35.447 --> 40:36.447
Am I disturbing you?

40:37.116 --> 40:38.116
No.

40:41.086 --> 40:44.455
I wanted to thank you,
but I thought it'd embarrass you.

40:45.527 --> 40:47.894
Men like me
are no good at politics.

40:50.900 --> 40:53.028
You do realize that I'm a woman?

40:55.607 --> 40:56.700
My job...

40:57.042 --> 40:59.705
has very little to do with politics.

40:59.845 --> 41:02.076
I just try to help people
as best I can.

41:11.027 --> 41:15.089
This is the road
in cross-section, in slices...

41:16.367 --> 41:19.633
The first stage is the machines
scraping the surface.

41:21.474 --> 41:24.034
The soil...
Then we treat the earth.

41:25.111 --> 41:26.774
And we put asphalt on top.

41:36.494 --> 41:40.022
How many people, in the end? 40?

41:41.367 --> 41:42.596
- About 50.
- Good.

41:43.169 --> 41:44.467
Thank you.

41:44.704 --> 41:46.400
Excuse me. Someone to see you.

41:52.448 --> 41:55.680
Know what they used to write
on old nautical charts?

41:56.053 --> 41:57.611
There was a line

41:57.755 --> 42:01.523
and it said: "'Beyond this limit,
we enter unknown territory"'.

42:02.661 --> 42:03.686
See you soon.

42:07.534 --> 42:08.866
Want a drink?

42:09.303 --> 42:10.361
No, thank you.

42:10.973 --> 42:13.033
- Do I sign everything?
- Yes.

42:14.645 --> 42:15.942
Where's your family?

42:19.384 --> 42:21.113
I have a son and an ex-wife.

42:22.889 --> 42:24.152
Does she work?

42:27.061 --> 42:28.653
Why do you ask?

42:29.397 --> 42:30.490
Don't know.

42:30.732 --> 42:33.463
The problems start
when you lose your job.

42:37.974 --> 42:39.441
Let's just say...

42:41.513 --> 42:42.810
we've drifted apart.

42:45.018 --> 42:46.018
That all you'll say?

42:53.795 --> 42:54.957
Doesn't matter.

42:58.202 --> 42:59.227
Weather forecast?

42:59.537 --> 43:01.129
Stable till tonight.

43:02.041 --> 43:04.601
Start excavation work
over 100 yards.

43:04.977 --> 43:07.811
Get to it before the storm comes.

43:38.053 --> 43:40.148
Construction of Highway 61a

44:19.342 --> 44:21.276
They've made good progress.

44:22.581 --> 44:24.276
The slopes are done and all.

44:33.795 --> 44:35.592
Hi. Alright?

44:35.998 --> 44:37.590
Pascal. Works with me.

44:37.866 --> 44:39.562
Here's the schedule.

44:39.802 --> 44:42.328
2 men didn't come today.
I replaced them,

44:42.772 --> 44:46.209
but I asked Monika to find others.
It's gonna be tight.

44:46.612 --> 44:47.874
Let's take a look.

44:50.782 --> 44:53.183
Louis, is it OK to park there?

44:53.319 --> 44:55.151
The parking lot's back there.

45:03.033 --> 45:05.298
The plans don't correspond to ours.

45:05.603 --> 45:08.038
I suggest we use ours,
'cause if we wait,

45:08.173 --> 45:11.701
the rain will be here by tonight
or tomorrow morning.

45:12.212 --> 45:13.270
It's very slimy clay.

45:13.413 --> 45:17.646
So, the vehicles will get stuck
and we'll have to stop work.

45:18.387 --> 45:19.718
Is that OK?

45:19.956 --> 45:21.217
I'll be right back.

45:24.193 --> 45:25.218
Gaby!

45:58.238 --> 45:59.331
You OK, guys?

46:03.045 --> 46:04.910
Pascal, call the water company.

46:05.215 --> 46:06.807
- What did you do?
- Dunno.

46:11.155 --> 46:13.181
No, it's water, not gas.

46:13.559 --> 46:15.084
Looks like we hit a pipe.

46:17.797 --> 46:19.288
What do we do?

46:25.774 --> 46:26.867
We need pumps.

46:27.010 --> 46:28.672
Got any pumps?

46:28.812 --> 46:31.007
C'mon, men, go get water pumps.

47:01.255 --> 47:04.623
I have a form for you to sign
for the water pumps.

47:04.759 --> 47:06.887
It's urgent. There's a flood.

47:07.029 --> 47:08.553
We need to talk.

47:08.899 --> 47:11.926
- Still no checkbooks?
- Keep giving out order forms.

47:12.170 --> 47:13.797
The small firms can't wait.

47:14.639 --> 47:15.767
Tell 'em to call me.

47:16.109 --> 47:17.508
You're hard to reach.

47:18.244 --> 47:19.575
Hey, guys!

47:22.517 --> 47:23.517
Come eat with us.

47:23.852 --> 47:25.012
I got an appointment.

47:45.813 --> 47:48.248
He didn't say
if he wanted weekly meetings?

47:48.550 --> 47:49.608
No.

47:49.986 --> 47:52.979
Isn't it strange
that no-one's come from CGI?

47:54.492 --> 47:56.619
He said they're coming next week.

47:57.095 --> 47:58.154
Well, we'll see.

48:01.702 --> 48:04.103
Why have you stayed a foreman?

48:04.839 --> 48:07.308
I get paid nice n' regular.

48:07.710 --> 48:10.042
I got enough trouble
with a wife n' kids.

48:10.546 --> 48:12.276
How do I get hired?

48:12.916 --> 48:14.578
Look n' learn. We'll see.

48:17.089 --> 48:19.717
Let's go.
It'll start raining any minute.

49:07.588 --> 49:09.784
It's Louis. We hit a water pipe.

49:10.024 --> 49:13.654
It's like a lake here.
We've lost 2 days.

49:14.597 --> 49:17.066
I've added a pump.
The first was too small.

49:17.767 --> 49:19.827
Do you think
we should go around it?

49:20.071 --> 49:21.265
What do you think?

49:21.707 --> 49:25.167
I think we should.
It's sunny now, but it won't last.

49:25.479 --> 49:26.845
It's gonna pour soon.

49:26.981 --> 49:29.951
We'll do that?
OK, I'll deal with it.

49:46.640 --> 49:47.868
See you.

49:51.178 --> 49:52.942
I left you 3 messages.

49:59.055 --> 50:02.492
The suppliers agreed
to be paid at 90 days.

50:02.994 --> 50:04.519
That's 3 months.

50:04.963 --> 50:06.693
What date's that?

50:06.899 --> 50:08.731
November 28.

50:08.870 --> 50:11.931
So, officially,
we don't owe anything till then.

50:13.610 --> 50:14.803
Should I write it down?

50:15.578 --> 50:16.977
No, it's OK.

50:25.892 --> 50:27.553
What time do you finish?

50:28.027 --> 50:29.723
Around midnight.

50:29.863 --> 50:32.662
It's OK.
I just have to get into the groove.

50:33.068 --> 50:34.660
I'm quitting soon, anyway.

50:35.303 --> 50:36.828
You should've told me.

50:37.474 --> 50:38.735
Don't worry, it's my problem.

50:42.480 --> 50:45.780
Will you give Nicolas a job?
It'd calm him down.

50:50.991 --> 50:53.153
If you're alone at night,
you can call us.

50:56.866 --> 50:58.767
Bye... boss!

51:33.313 --> 51:37.945
Article 215: The spouses
share in their estate.

51:38.587 --> 51:41.557
Lastly, the parents
consult their child

51:41.692 --> 51:43.853
on decisions
which concern him or her.

51:44.896 --> 51:48.298
So, Barbara and Michel,
I wish you every happiness.

51:55.709 --> 51:57.143
You can kiss now!

52:00.582 --> 52:03.883
I went to the site.
They said you had an appointment.

52:04.054 --> 52:05.147
Probably.

52:07.659 --> 52:09.594
Do you go home at weekend?

52:10.061 --> 52:11.086
Rarely.

52:12.598 --> 52:15.831
With all that traveling,
don't you get lonely?

52:18.106 --> 52:19.768
It's only for a while.

52:21.344 --> 52:24.644
You do it to earn money,
then you move on.

52:24.882 --> 52:26.350
If you can...

52:28.720 --> 52:30.018
Are you from here?

52:30.289 --> 52:32.689
Oh, no, my parents are from Lyon.

52:34.027 --> 52:36.154
I came here with my husband.

52:39.200 --> 52:43.069
Actually, I'm a widow.
It's been 5 years now.

52:44.106 --> 52:46.337
My husband was the mayor.

52:46.543 --> 52:50.641
I was in charge of the charities
and I bred horses.

52:51.149 --> 52:53.777
When he died,
people asked me to take over.

52:54.119 --> 52:56.588
My daughter studied far away,
so I did.

52:57.758 --> 52:59.055
You live alone?

53:00.629 --> 53:03.121
Yes, I try to. And you?

53:04.033 --> 53:05.126
No...

53:06.103 --> 53:07.195
No, I...

53:10.675 --> 53:13.908
You like to scare people, don't you?
It's your thing, huh?

53:16.149 --> 53:17.275
Do I scare you?

53:18.085 --> 53:20.680
I don't know. Just enough...

53:20.822 --> 53:21.845
This way.

53:27.731 --> 53:31.168
You can go the other way,
but I like this way.

53:47.557 --> 53:49.025
It's from a Russian icon.

53:49.927 --> 53:51.623
Well, we're not really sure.

53:52.931 --> 53:54.592
We're carrying out research.

53:54.934 --> 53:57.768
Or rather I am,
because no-one else cares.

54:00.307 --> 54:04.301
It's not very valuable,
but it's better here than in a museum.

54:06.816 --> 54:09.342
It makes a change
from neighborhood quarrels.

54:10.053 --> 54:12.614
I like coming here.
It has something.

54:15.326 --> 54:16.726
Who pays for all this?

54:18.198 --> 54:20.826
The local communities.
It doesn't matter.

54:23.204 --> 54:25.536
Why do you always ask who pays?

54:27.843 --> 54:29.277
Do you like the colors?

54:32.684 --> 54:34.083
I wouldn't know.

54:38.357 --> 54:40.588
I'm supposed to have stopped...

54:42.029 --> 54:44.089
I like to smoke when it's cold.

54:44.800 --> 54:46.290
Do you want to...

54:47.236 --> 54:49.000
There's a bowling alley...

54:51.174 --> 54:52.767
A bowling alley!

54:52.910 --> 54:54.741
You want to take me bowling?!

54:56.381 --> 54:57.848
Isn't that a bit crazy?

54:59.919 --> 55:01.716
You like bowling, do you?

55:01.854 --> 55:04.824
I never go.
I was just saying...

55:09.297 --> 55:11.163
I've never met anyone like you.

55:48.516 --> 55:49.643
Mom?

55:52.020 --> 55:53.579
I'm in my room, honey.

55:53.723 --> 55:56.387
I'm with Denis.
I'm taking the car. Bye.

55:57.194 --> 55:58.287
Bye.

56:38.416 --> 56:39.906
It's all fake...

56:57.473 --> 56:59.306
We'll have to stop tomorrow.

56:59.510 --> 57:01.274
It's not in the estimate
or the schedule.

57:01.412 --> 57:03.176
It's decision time.

57:04.016 --> 57:07.076
I'll tell you tonight, OK?

57:08.455 --> 57:10.116
You said that last time.

57:13.228 --> 57:14.560
It's your responsibility.

57:47.274 --> 57:48.502
It's me.

57:50.444 --> 57:52.844
I wanted to talk to you.

57:54.315 --> 57:56.181
To say I feel good with you.

57:57.953 --> 57:59.546
I won't hurt you.

58:39.809 --> 58:41.106
What's going on?

58:41.510 --> 58:44.105
I tried to repair the car.
I cut my hand.

58:44.614 --> 58:46.947
Then, my cell fell in the water.

58:47.151 --> 58:48.414
It's pissing blood.

58:48.588 --> 58:49.987
What're you doing here?

58:50.123 --> 58:53.958
You asked me to get fencing
to put in front of the office.

58:54.396 --> 58:56.990
It's all in the trunk,
but the car broke down.

58:57.132 --> 58:58.964
Got a cloth?
I'll bleed all over.

59:14.221 --> 59:17.089
- Should I call a doctor?
- No, it's OK.

59:18.326 --> 59:19.326
Thanks.

59:25.636 --> 59:27.365
It's not serious.

59:39.055 --> 59:41.023
Monika's a bit in love with you.

59:43.960 --> 59:45.120
I don't think she is.

59:46.564 --> 59:50.365
Not surprising, with all that's happened
since you came.

59:53.639 --> 59:56.302
Funny thing,
changing people's lives, huh?

59:58.045 --> 59:59.205
Don't you think?

01:00:04.587 --> 01:00:06.555
The kid isn't my son.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:08.487
I love him, but he's not mine.

01:00:09.026 --> 01:00:11.518
I don't know
who or where his dad is.

01:00:12.398 --> 01:00:13.398
He did a runner

01:00:13.532 --> 01:00:16.094
when Monika was pregnant.

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.172
I do what I can to help.

01:00:23.212 --> 01:00:24.703
My dad

01:00:25.014 --> 01:00:28.974
spent his life telling me
I was a useless idiot.

01:00:31.156 --> 01:00:33.488
He died
before I could spit in his face.

01:00:35.461 --> 01:00:36.690
What do you want to say?

01:00:37.631 --> 01:00:42.399
Your scams with the suppliers
are no business of ours.

01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:46.032
No-one'll come asking about it.

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:48.508
As long as we get paid,
we don't care.

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:51.181
It's better than nothing.

01:00:56.356 --> 01:00:57.686
What do you want?

01:00:59.627 --> 01:01:01.095
Dough?

01:01:01.629 --> 01:01:03.063
Money?

01:01:05.034 --> 01:01:07.127
I don't give a shit about money.

01:01:07.336 --> 01:01:09.271
I know where to find it.

01:01:11.743 --> 01:01:14.109
What counts is
that we all achieve something.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.072
You understand that?

01:01:19.219 --> 01:01:20.413
Or you wouldn't be here.

01:01:25.093 --> 01:01:26.219
What're you gonna do?

01:01:26.595 --> 01:01:28.927
Get your gun out? Then what?

01:01:30.433 --> 01:01:32.061
Where will you go?

01:01:35.139 --> 01:01:38.166
Sit down. Let's have a drink...
Sorry about that.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.348
Finally!

01:01:47.324 --> 01:01:48.654
Feel better?

01:01:52.329 --> 01:01:55.027
We're trying to have a baby.

01:01:58.237 --> 01:02:00.332
Think I'd make a good father?

01:02:00.473 --> 01:02:02.237
Be honest.

01:02:04.645 --> 01:02:05.670
"'Boss" '!

01:02:07.048 --> 01:02:11.179
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

01:02:11.487 --> 01:02:12.682
A big crowd tonight.

01:02:13.423 --> 01:02:16.518
Over 300 people. Thank you

01:02:17.262 --> 01:02:20.289
for coming to the grand final.

01:02:20.933 --> 01:02:25.702
It shows how interested you are
in handball.

01:02:29.361 --> 01:02:30.886
Before we start...

01:02:33.733 --> 01:02:36.168
Before we start the game,

01:02:36.304 --> 01:02:40.174
I want you to give
a very warm welcome

01:02:40.576 --> 01:02:42.738
to the mayors
of tonight's two towns.

01:02:43.347 --> 01:02:45.781
Mr Jaudon, Mayor of Barsac

01:02:46.083 --> 01:02:48.552
and Mrs Stéphane Arnaud
of St Berto!

01:02:48.753 --> 01:02:50.220
A big hand!

01:02:56.063 --> 01:02:58.430
Sports events like these

01:02:58.566 --> 01:03:01.296
would not go ahead
without sponsors.

01:03:01.436 --> 01:03:05.670
I call on Mr Barracher,
Manager of the Banque Populaire.

01:03:12.886 --> 01:03:16.881
Last but not least,
Mr Philippe Miller of GMTR.

01:03:17.191 --> 01:03:20.559
As you know,
he has restarted the road works.

01:03:20.896 --> 01:03:24.094
He's the man who saved us.
Mr Philippe Miller

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:26.225
of GMTR!

01:03:34.446 --> 01:03:36.244
It's now time for the game.

01:03:36.383 --> 01:03:39.443
Give a big hand to the two teams!

01:04:03.385 --> 01:04:05.547
I'm from the paper.
I keep calling you.

01:04:05.689 --> 01:04:08.887
You must give some time
for the article I'm writing.

01:04:33.257 --> 01:04:35.522
I didn't think it'd go like this.

01:04:38.866 --> 01:04:40.423
It's not what I planned.

01:04:40.801 --> 01:04:42.268
What do you mean?

01:04:46.208 --> 01:04:47.767
What did you plan?

01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:53.783
You don't plan things -
you let them happen.

01:04:56.888 --> 01:04:59.859
Did you just need me
for your damn road works?

01:05:01.795 --> 01:05:03.660
Is that all this was about?

01:05:05.533 --> 01:05:06.865
This feels wrong.

01:06:05.847 --> 01:06:08.180
I think you've lived alone too long.

01:06:19.164 --> 01:06:20.859
I've wasted so much time.

01:06:40.691 --> 01:06:43.820
The guy with the water pump
wants a check or cash.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.834
The order forms won't work anymore.

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:53.500
People are talking.

01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:56.776
They don't want
to be conned again.

01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:00.174
I won't let 'em down.

01:07:00.718 --> 01:07:02.619
What about those damn checkbooks?

01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:05.548
Where's Nicolas?

01:07:06.426 --> 01:07:08.224
He didn't come home last night.

01:07:10.298 --> 01:07:13.427
- I'll call him.
- It doesn't concern you. Enough!

01:07:35.531 --> 01:07:38.661
Hello. I'm Mr Barracher
from the Banque Populaire.

01:07:40.705 --> 01:07:41.705
OK!

01:07:42.006 --> 01:07:43.304
Come with me.

01:07:44.509 --> 01:07:46.842
It's quicklime,
to dry out the ground.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.574
Mind your eyes now.

01:07:51.685 --> 01:07:55.680
Then, it hardens
and the road rollers can get to work.

01:07:55.825 --> 01:07:58.294
Then, the asphalt.
I'll show you.

01:07:58.896 --> 01:08:00.089
Your first time?

01:08:00.397 --> 01:08:03.561
Yes. I usually visit small farms.

01:08:03.868 --> 01:08:05.063
Look at this.

01:08:05.905 --> 01:08:08.431
If it rains now,
we have to start over.

01:08:16.519 --> 01:08:20.854
I don't understand. Your company
is a subsidiary of a huge group.

01:08:21.692 --> 01:08:22.692
Yeah.

01:08:23.028 --> 01:08:26.930
I run a little country branch.
I know nothing about all that.

01:08:27.433 --> 01:08:30.698
I'm not talking
about the project as a whole.

01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:33.372
Just a small temporary problem

01:08:33.506 --> 01:08:35.100
of petty cash.

01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:38.636
Wait a minute...

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:42.051
Your company
must have a bank, accounts...

01:08:42.353 --> 01:08:44.116
There's a whole structure.

01:08:44.788 --> 01:08:48.624
Yes, but in the meantime,
I still don't have a checkbook. Sugar?

01:08:53.866 --> 01:08:56.359
Can you give me a ballpark figure?

01:08:57.104 --> 01:08:59.631
It's not a great deal.

01:08:59.776 --> 01:09:02.768
The electricity bill,
office supplies...

01:09:03.046 --> 01:09:05.447
Around 25,000 euros.

01:09:06.018 --> 01:09:08.645
Yes, proportionally, that's not much.

01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:16.193
So, you just want to open an account

01:09:16.497 --> 01:09:20.094
to pay your immediate expenses.
It's a cash flow problem.

01:09:20.403 --> 01:09:21.665
Exactly.

01:09:27.979 --> 01:09:29.037
What about the wages?

01:09:29.548 --> 01:09:31.948
No, the agency deals with that.

01:09:32.084 --> 01:09:34.712
There's no problem with that
till the 28th.

01:09:36.991 --> 01:09:39.962
You saw the site
yet I can't even write checks for fuel!

01:09:42.099 --> 01:09:43.429
Indeed.

01:09:48.006 --> 01:09:51.875
Like the others, it's in my interest
to do business with you.

01:09:54.515 --> 01:09:58.475
And I must admit it's exciting
to be part of such a big adventure.

01:10:00.056 --> 01:10:02.388
What do you need
to open an account?

01:10:02.691 --> 01:10:05.684
As with any company,
a trade register certificate,

01:10:05.929 --> 01:10:09.024
an ID card,
and an initial transfer of funds.

01:10:10.436 --> 01:10:13.872
But the transfer is the same problem
as the checkbook.

01:10:14.874 --> 01:10:18.504
Well, in the meantime,
as the sums aren't very big,

01:10:18.646 --> 01:10:20.706
we can offer invoice discounting.

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:23.375
That just buys you a few weeks.

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:28.784
The legal limit is 2 months, but...

01:10:29.094 --> 01:10:32.326
You present us with your bills,
and we'll honor them.

01:10:32.998 --> 01:10:35.524
It solves a firm's
cash flow problems.

01:10:35.702 --> 01:10:38.763
Not that companies like yours
are strapped for cash!

01:10:41.609 --> 01:10:42.770
That's good.

01:10:46.883 --> 01:10:49.876
With the gasoline
and lighting, that's the total.

01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:53.014
Call me if you need me.

01:11:00.869 --> 01:11:03.565
37,000 euros?
Your car costs more than that!

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:07.602
I'll get things started,

01:11:07.744 --> 01:11:11.374
but I need your company ID number.

01:11:11.516 --> 01:11:13.485
That's very important, OK?

01:11:14.052 --> 01:11:15.052
Thank you again.

01:11:19.093 --> 01:11:21.927
Have lunch with us... for once.

01:11:40.888 --> 01:11:43.356
How long will it take to dry?

01:11:43.491 --> 01:11:46.723
2 days, provided it doesn't rain,
but it could well do.

01:11:46.862 --> 01:11:48.832
I can't wait 2 days.

01:11:49.633 --> 01:11:51.625
I thought of something last night.

01:11:52.503 --> 01:11:54.904
If the embankments
are 8 instead of 10,

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.839
that's 20,000 cubic yards
less earth to move.

01:11:58.444 --> 01:12:00.936
If you can do 50 rotations
instead of 35,

01:12:01.081 --> 01:12:03.050
we save a week.

01:12:03.518 --> 01:12:05.679
If we use more, won't it dry faster?

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:06.888
We can try.

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:10.288
The 28th!
We have to finish by the 28th.

01:12:11.862 --> 01:12:12.920
Come on!

01:12:14.332 --> 01:12:16.266
Hello. Philippe Miller here.

01:12:16.401 --> 01:12:19.336
No, I have the bill
right in front of me.

01:12:19.472 --> 01:12:21.030
A total of 11,630.

01:12:21.508 --> 01:12:24.500
I'll do it as quickly as possible.
You have my word.

01:12:25.045 --> 01:12:26.444
2,125 euros.

01:12:26.748 --> 01:12:29.980
When it rains,
we can't get anything done.

01:12:30.286 --> 01:12:33.382
Hello. This is Mr Miller here.

01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:35.959
There's a problem
with the checkbook.

01:12:36.261 --> 01:12:38.697
The start of next week
at the latest.

01:12:38.897 --> 01:12:41.492
No, it's not
in my own best interest.

01:12:41.635 --> 01:12:45.664
We'll do what's necessary.
And I'll handle it myself.

01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:50.002
Look what he's just sent.

01:12:53.983 --> 01:12:56.545
That's no good, it's not an original.

01:12:57.622 --> 01:13:00.023
- Should I call him back?
- Yes, do.

01:13:00.493 --> 01:13:02.984
- Did you send his checkbooks?
- Yes.

01:13:05.565 --> 01:13:07.534
Look at that.
Isn't it something?

01:13:08.069 --> 01:13:10.368
I'll take you. It's worth seeing.

01:13:22.622 --> 01:13:25.456
Now you'll stop saying
we're not a regular firm.

01:13:26.093 --> 01:13:28.790
You've spent far more than you said.

01:13:29.065 --> 01:13:30.828
I still have to pay for fuel.

01:13:30.966 --> 01:13:32.524
It's gonna be a problem.

01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:37.500
Call Louis, tell him I'm on my way.
Off we go.

01:13:37.909 --> 01:13:39.809
- Can you sign this?
- Later.

01:13:39.945 --> 01:13:44.007
There's been a mistake.
You were sent a fax.

01:13:44.851 --> 01:13:46.751
Yeah, I'll deal with it.

01:13:46.954 --> 01:13:51.619
The other thing is, I've just checked
your first statement.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.561
I have it here.
This isn't at all what we agreed.

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:59.630
I can't hear you.
It's too noisy.

01:14:00.439 --> 01:14:01.599
I'll call you back.

01:14:01.973 --> 01:14:04.500
As soon as you can. Goodbye.

01:14:13.356 --> 01:14:16.416
- It's starting to look like something.
- Like a road!

01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:23.795
Let's go have coffee.

01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:32.036
Excuse me... Hello.

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:36.643
You know they buried the Pharaohs
with a beetle on their chest?

01:14:37.453 --> 01:14:38.478
No, I didn't.

01:14:38.722 --> 01:14:42.683
One of my men told me today.
I had no idea.

01:14:43.095 --> 01:14:44.996
Did you work all night?

01:14:45.965 --> 01:14:47.557
I didn't hear you leave.

01:14:47.801 --> 01:14:49.394
I'm sorry.

01:14:50.938 --> 01:14:52.098
Don't worry.

01:14:53.675 --> 01:14:55.007
I want you.

01:14:58.682 --> 01:15:00.707
I think about it all the time.

01:15:01.118 --> 01:15:02.552
All the time.

01:15:03.922 --> 01:15:06.050
I didn't know
you could feel this way.

01:15:09.796 --> 01:15:10.990
Love you.

01:15:30.925 --> 01:15:32.893
Come on, guys!

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.802
The owner of the scooter
may not press charges.

01:15:41.105 --> 01:15:42.731
I didn't even damage it.

01:15:42.873 --> 01:15:44.432
Sign here.

01:15:47.045 --> 01:15:48.741
Will you ever stop messing up?

01:16:06.136 --> 01:16:08.163
Did you give the cops my number?

01:16:09.208 --> 01:16:11.006
They can get that anywhere.

01:16:12.246 --> 01:16:15.977
I just said I worked for you.
It was the magic word.

01:16:17.052 --> 01:16:18.280
Bunch of jerks!

01:16:20.023 --> 01:16:21.889
All that for a stupid scooter...

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:25.855
I don't deal anymore,
just deliver.

01:16:26.932 --> 01:16:29.298
I threw it all away
before the cops got me.

01:16:31.871 --> 01:16:34.272
I don't know how I'll pay for it.

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:41.950
They say, after prison,
you wanna take on the world.

01:16:42.651 --> 01:16:43.914
Maybe that's what I need.

01:16:46.123 --> 01:16:48.684
After prison, you're all alone.

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.931
You'd shoot yourself
rather than go back inside.

01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:08.675
Put that on plates
and spread them out.

01:17:08.953 --> 01:17:09.953
Is there a dance?

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:23.729
You lower the blade
to scoop up the earth.

01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:25.372
It's called a scraper.

01:17:26.009 --> 01:17:27.977
That's the safety. Like that,

01:17:28.112 --> 01:17:30.047
it won't start.

01:17:30.714 --> 01:17:35.120
Gaby, I want Nicolas
to demonstrate the excavator.

01:17:35.255 --> 01:17:36.779
We'll show you how it works.

01:17:38.126 --> 01:17:39.126
Thanks, Gaby.

01:17:43.599 --> 01:17:46.262
- Esteban, up you go.
- I don't have a license!

01:17:46.403 --> 01:17:47.996
Step back, kids.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.200
Give him a big hand!

01:17:50.608 --> 01:17:52.770
Nicolas! Nicolas!

01:18:08.064 --> 01:18:10.033
The kids have a surprise.

01:18:17.042 --> 01:18:19.808
Don't worry, I won't damage it.

01:19:25.733 --> 01:19:27.999
Finish practising with Gaby.

01:19:28.137 --> 01:19:30.867
Then, you can join the night crew.
How's that?

01:19:31.007 --> 01:19:32.976
Day or night's fine by me.

01:19:33.243 --> 01:19:34.836
That's OK with me.

01:19:35.112 --> 01:19:36.704
How's that, then?

01:19:57.576 --> 01:19:59.942
There are things about my life
you don't know.

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:10.151
You can start a new life.
That's what life's for.

01:20:13.797 --> 01:20:16.767
I haven't wanted to settle down
in a long time.

01:20:22.507 --> 01:20:24.476
It'd make me very happy.

01:20:58.055 --> 01:20:59.545
The bank manager rang all day.

01:20:59.690 --> 01:21:02.490
To hell with him. He's nobody.

01:21:03.062 --> 01:21:04.529
Who'll pay for all this?

01:21:04.664 --> 01:21:07.634
He's rejected
our most recent checks.

01:21:07.901 --> 01:21:10.166
All the suppliers are yelling at me.

01:21:11.775 --> 01:21:12.775
I'm sick of it.

01:21:13.576 --> 01:21:15.203
I'm trying to help you.

01:21:16.314 --> 01:21:18.214
Look how beautiful it is.

01:21:18.883 --> 01:21:21.079
You don't realize what's happening.

01:21:21.286 --> 01:21:23.914
If it was going to stop,
we'd know by now.

01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:26.053
Why should it stop?

01:22:17.259 --> 01:22:18.852
C'mon, guys, c'mon!

01:22:54.843 --> 01:22:56.572
DO NOT OPEN

01:23:13.066 --> 01:23:15.968
Project Manager of Highway 61a

01:23:49.447 --> 01:23:51.814
Come along with me, Nicolas.

01:24:00.428 --> 01:24:01.486
Leave a message.

01:24:01.631 --> 01:24:05.592
This is Mr Barracher from the bank.
I keep leaving you messages.

01:24:05.904 --> 01:24:07.064
I have to say

01:24:07.205 --> 01:24:09.766
that unless you sort out
the paperwork,

01:24:09.974 --> 01:24:12.102
I'll have to consult my superiors.

01:24:12.545 --> 01:24:16.141
I think it's deplorable
that it's come to this.

01:24:16.584 --> 01:24:20.077
This cannot continue,
so please call me back very soon.

01:24:23.259 --> 01:24:25.251
What about these 2 checks?

01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:26.930
What can I do?

01:24:26.996 --> 01:24:29.262
He'll only open an account elsewhere.

01:24:32.672 --> 01:24:34.503
I believed in this guy.

01:24:35.541 --> 01:24:36.736
I believed in him.

01:24:53.366 --> 01:24:55.334
C'mon, guys, c'monl

01:25:39.226 --> 01:25:40.785
When did this happen?

01:25:43.899 --> 01:25:45.196
They took the petty cash.

01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:48.160
Why do people do this?

01:25:48.305 --> 01:25:50.273
How am I supposed to work now?

01:25:50.874 --> 01:25:52.342
The printer's gone.

01:25:56.848 --> 01:25:59.648
Don't throw these away.
They're important.

01:26:00.921 --> 01:26:02.218
No, we have no idea.

01:26:02.923 --> 01:26:04.858
Last month,
they wrecked a school.

01:26:05.694 --> 01:26:08.289
So, what now?
Do you need papers?

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:12.193
We've seen the damage.
Now you must come file a complaint.

01:26:13.236 --> 01:26:14.236
You're here?

01:26:14.707 --> 01:26:15.969
I'm working.

01:26:18.778 --> 01:26:21.771
One of your employees
is a familiar face. That boy.

01:26:21.982 --> 01:26:23.779
He works for us.

01:26:24.953 --> 01:26:26.250
It's not him.

01:26:26.389 --> 01:26:27.753
Well, goodbye.

01:26:41.941 --> 01:26:44.377
The police said
you won't file a complaint.

01:26:47.982 --> 01:26:49.007
Why's that?

01:26:49.952 --> 01:26:52.888
I don't have time.
Not anymore.

01:27:00.032 --> 01:27:02.160
It's not that bad. Come here.

01:27:17.822 --> 01:27:19.153
What is it?

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.326
I have to go.

01:27:33.944 --> 01:27:35.808
I'll let you know, Mrs Arnaud.

01:27:35.946 --> 01:27:37.106
Come with me.

01:27:39.184 --> 01:27:40.184
Someone to see you.

01:27:51.301 --> 01:27:53.064
Is this a bad time?

01:27:59.778 --> 01:28:03.146
The bastards!
They did it last night?

01:28:06.853 --> 01:28:08.151
Wow!

01:28:10.325 --> 01:28:11.622
You told the insurer?

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:14.160
Yes, but they'll take ages
to pay out.

01:28:14.296 --> 01:28:16.629
I can't work without a computer.

01:28:21.239 --> 01:28:23.640
Should I call you boss?

01:28:30.652 --> 01:28:33.952
I met a lot of locals,
looking for you.

01:28:34.724 --> 01:28:39.185
They call you the big boss,
Mr Philippe.

01:28:39.964 --> 01:28:41.363
"'Mr" ' Philippe...

01:28:45.137 --> 01:28:46.729
How did you find me?

01:28:48.408 --> 01:28:51.276
Someone saw you on TV,
showing off.

01:28:53.714 --> 01:28:55.945
You ain't exactly discreet.

01:28:58.354 --> 01:29:01.347
What exactly is all this crap?

01:29:03.962 --> 01:29:05.293
What do you want? Money?

01:29:07.266 --> 01:29:08.791
Dough!

01:29:10.137 --> 01:29:11.662
Bread!

01:29:16.812 --> 01:29:20.250
The car and all the rest you took
makes a lot of bread.

01:29:25.290 --> 01:29:27.851
You steal a lot of bread
off these folk?

01:29:29.095 --> 01:29:30.893
I'm not doing it for the money.

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:35.931
Why do you do it, then?

01:29:39.775 --> 01:29:40.775
Why?

01:29:46.251 --> 01:29:48.151
You know that Claude left me?

01:29:50.222 --> 01:29:52.351
You caused me a lot of trouble.

01:29:59.502 --> 01:30:01.436
I won't let you mess things up.

01:30:01.739 --> 01:30:03.764
So, you might as well kill me now.

01:30:06.277 --> 01:30:08.405
That's what I'm doing.

01:30:16.057 --> 01:30:17.115
Here...

01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:24.160
I found this little beetle
on your site.

01:30:27.505 --> 01:30:29.804
I've got some, but not all of them.

01:30:30.776 --> 01:30:31.869
So long.

01:31:05.755 --> 01:31:06.755
I heard the news.

01:31:07.324 --> 01:31:09.987
Is everything in the box?

01:31:10.128 --> 01:31:11.390
Monika can call me.

01:31:11.996 --> 01:31:12.996
What's the time?

01:31:13.232 --> 01:31:14.359
Forty past ten.

01:31:17.003 --> 01:31:19.599
Monika said
you haven't paid for the fuel.

01:31:19.742 --> 01:31:21.870
I want to finish before it rains.

01:31:22.112 --> 01:31:23.204
Is it going to rain?

01:31:23.646 --> 01:31:25.979
We'll run out of gas in a few hours.

01:31:40.735 --> 01:31:42.226
34,000.

01:31:42.871 --> 01:31:44.703
Hurry it up!

01:31:46.343 --> 01:31:49.107
The gas is coming.
What else has to be paid for?

01:31:49.413 --> 01:31:50.744
The lighting.

01:31:51.048 --> 01:31:53.779
He wants cash.
He won't wait till the 28th.

01:31:59.126 --> 01:32:00.650
Give them that for now.

01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:04.092
What's going on?

01:32:15.982 --> 01:32:17.916
I can sell you another car.

01:32:39.947 --> 01:32:43.144
There's 10,000.
Now can you wait a week?

01:32:43.351 --> 01:32:46.015
No, Mr Miller,
it's a matter of trust.

01:32:46.256 --> 01:32:48.952
What more do you need
to let us work?

01:32:49.192 --> 01:32:51.957
Please calm down.
Come into my office.

01:32:52.231 --> 01:32:53.926
- I don't have time.
- Mr Miller!

01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:56.534
What do I have to do?

01:33:03.612 --> 01:33:05.774
I rang his firm, CGI.

01:33:06.082 --> 01:33:08.880
They didn't even know
the work had resumed.

01:33:09.619 --> 01:33:11.520
I'll call her back and find out.

01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:13.948
Does your boss know?

01:33:14.458 --> 01:33:17.429
At first, he was so proud
to be a part of it.

01:33:17.563 --> 01:33:21.694
Now he's afraid he'll be asked
to explain himself.

01:33:25.106 --> 01:33:27.507
Did you call the cops
about the break-in?

01:33:28.478 --> 01:33:31.471
He won't file a complaint.
And he's bought new stuff.

01:33:31.815 --> 01:33:32.839
He can't write checks.

01:33:36.789 --> 01:33:38.450
I don't know
where he gets the money.

01:33:39.292 --> 01:33:40.816
We'll soon find out.

01:33:46.401 --> 01:33:48.529
I don't want to land in shit again.

01:34:55.593 --> 01:34:58.324
- I gotta go to work.
- Now?

01:34:58.630 --> 01:35:00.928
I'm working from 9 PM to 5 AM.

01:35:01.933 --> 01:35:03.162
Goodnight.

01:35:30.438 --> 01:35:31.906
There's 10,000.

01:35:33.809 --> 01:35:35.744
All that for 10,000 shitty euros.

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.543
It's all I have left.

01:35:39.617 --> 01:35:42.985
What next? You gonna pay 'em back
all the money you stole?

01:35:47.561 --> 01:35:49.996
Your project's just hot air.

01:35:51.265 --> 01:35:55.703
You'll go down for 10 years
and hang yourself in your cell.

01:36:01.212 --> 01:36:03.738
Work is a fool's game,
I always said so.

01:36:09.322 --> 01:36:14.421
I'm going to pay a little visit
to your friend, the lady mayor.

01:36:18.835 --> 01:36:22.295
It'll give her a shock
when I spill the beans, won't it?

01:36:25.878 --> 01:36:28.678
2 days... I'll give you 2 days.

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:39.687
You know where to reach me.

01:37:59.368 --> 01:38:00.368
Does it hurt?

01:38:01.137 --> 01:38:03.606
I just want to finish my job.

01:38:04.774 --> 01:38:06.003
Want to see a doctor?

01:38:13.052 --> 01:38:14.883
I've done some bad things in life.

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:20.652
You need to rest.

01:38:22.164 --> 01:38:23.631
We'll make it.

01:38:24.533 --> 01:38:25.967
I know we will.

01:38:27.103 --> 01:38:28.867
You can't carry on like this.

01:38:31.477 --> 01:38:32.603
Look at them.

01:38:32.744 --> 01:38:33.939
We'll make it.

01:38:41.022 --> 01:38:45.461
Stéphane, there are worrying rumors
about the highway.

01:38:45.896 --> 01:38:47.489
False and unpaid invoices,

01:38:48.433 --> 01:38:49.524
trafficking...

01:38:50.401 --> 01:38:53.462
I hope
we haven't been helping a crook.

01:38:53.939 --> 01:38:56.568
What does he stand to gain from it?

01:38:57.577 --> 01:38:59.478
You were seen with that guy.

01:38:59.914 --> 01:39:01.472
People talk.

01:39:01.716 --> 01:39:05.585
You were happy to have
your picture taken with "'that guy" '.

01:39:07.391 --> 01:39:08.983
C'mon, guys!

01:39:09.425 --> 01:39:10.826
It's stopped raining.

01:40:17.516 --> 01:40:19.610
We might finish tomorrow night.

01:40:22.723 --> 01:40:23.917
Finish what?

01:40:26.161 --> 01:40:27.161
The road.

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:31.963
I don't want you to lie to me.

01:40:33.003 --> 01:40:34.937
There's nothing more humiliating.

01:40:36.441 --> 01:40:38.534
You've never been truly humiliated.

01:40:47.856 --> 01:40:49.951
I can't give up now.

01:40:51.127 --> 01:40:52.686
It's too late.

01:41:03.544 --> 01:41:05.478
I can't believe it.

01:41:06.647 --> 01:41:08.138
I can't believe it's real.

01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:11.912
Why?

01:41:13.891 --> 01:41:15.518
Because it was possible.

01:41:20.399 --> 01:41:22.026
With me, too?

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.866
We've done something extraordinary.

01:41:48.636 --> 01:41:49.933
Known Philippe long?

01:41:50.639 --> 01:41:52.003
His real name's Paul.

01:41:52.575 --> 01:41:53.701
Been on jobs together?

01:41:54.810 --> 01:41:56.210
His name's Paul... Paulo.

01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:58.248
I know that.

01:42:00.017 --> 01:42:02.919
Hello. Good timing.
I'm with your little protégé!

01:42:04.691 --> 01:42:05.885
I've got the cash.

01:42:06.125 --> 01:42:07.889
Hang on, I can't hear you.

01:42:08.763 --> 01:42:09.923
Where can we meet?

01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:13.164
Here. I'm at the Jack Pots.

01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:15.062
I don't wanna be seen with you.

01:42:15.472 --> 01:42:17.600
There's a sugar refinery nearby.

01:42:19.210 --> 01:42:21.645
- Stay a while.
- I'm on the night shift.

01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:22.780
Wait.

01:42:23.549 --> 01:42:26.951
Can you get me some gear?
I hear you're the man.

01:42:27.988 --> 01:42:28.988
You heard wrong.

01:44:37.659 --> 01:44:39.389
Hello. Police.

01:45:02.893 --> 01:45:04.861
His car is in the parking lot.

01:45:05.263 --> 01:45:06.957
No-one cleaned his room?

01:45:07.098 --> 01:45:09.226
We didn't want to disturb him.

01:45:16.844 --> 01:45:18.608
Should I call the police?

01:45:21.784 --> 01:45:23.445
Philippe, it's Monika.

01:45:46.016 --> 01:45:48.781
It's Nicolas.
Bring some black coffee.

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.786
We looked all over for you.

01:45:59.634 --> 01:46:01.865
Looks like you've done that
all your life.

01:46:02.104 --> 01:46:03.901
It seems ages ago.

01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:06.270
I'll get the coffee
or it'll take hours.

01:46:19.559 --> 01:46:20.685
I saw your pal earlier.

01:46:21.296 --> 01:46:23.264
He was leaving.
He looked rough.

01:46:28.606 --> 01:46:30.437
We need you on site, Philippe.

01:46:30.574 --> 01:46:32.543
We can't do anything without you.

01:46:38.885 --> 01:46:40.683
Can you stop for a minute?

01:46:45.861 --> 01:46:46.861
What's going on?

01:46:47.563 --> 01:46:48.861
I'm pregnant.

01:46:52.203 --> 01:46:55.469
We've been trying for a long time.
It worked at last.

01:46:56.842 --> 01:46:59.903
- We wanted to tell you first.
- We're happy.

01:47:09.625 --> 01:47:10.683
Congratulations.

01:47:17.503 --> 01:47:19.495
I spoke to the agency
this morning.

01:47:20.507 --> 01:47:23.203
Your wages will be paid
as usual on Friday.

01:47:23.911 --> 01:47:25.277
Don't listen to gossip.

01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:28.550
We have a job to finish.
We'll finish it together.

01:47:28.685 --> 01:47:29.777
Well, we'll try.

01:47:31.654 --> 01:47:33.520
- The beer's on me.
- Thanks.

01:47:34.059 --> 01:47:36.926
- I'll go talk to the night crew.
- Bye.

01:47:40.266 --> 01:47:41.893
We'll take his word for it.

01:47:42.036 --> 01:47:43.560
We have no choice.

01:47:44.538 --> 01:47:45.665
We have to trust him.

01:47:45.807 --> 01:47:47.935
There's always rumors flying around.

01:47:48.243 --> 01:47:51.042
Rival firms try to mess things up.

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:53.579
We have mouths to feed.

01:47:53.716 --> 01:47:58.020
If you work and don't get paid,
they're thieves, not bosses.

01:48:26.761 --> 01:48:30.060
We've had a bill for a firm called GMTR.
Heard of them?

01:48:30.565 --> 01:48:31.565
What's the bill?

01:48:31.701 --> 01:48:34.670
Legrand, plant hire.
83,000 euros.

01:48:34.804 --> 01:48:36.032
How much?!

01:48:37.208 --> 01:48:38.938
Whose signature is this?

01:48:41.647 --> 01:48:43.114
These are the latest plans.

01:48:45.686 --> 01:48:46.846
Coffee?

01:48:48.056 --> 01:48:49.056
What do you think?

01:48:51.127 --> 01:48:53.358
- Well?
- Not good. Rain is forecast.

01:48:54.631 --> 01:48:58.625
Let's protect these embankments.
They're the most exposed.

01:48:59.203 --> 01:49:00.728
Why don't we protect them to here?

01:49:02.641 --> 01:49:03.938
Yeah, we can try.

01:49:05.178 --> 01:49:06.907
What if there's heavy rain?

01:49:07.247 --> 01:49:08.806
Then, we're dead.

01:49:13.755 --> 01:49:15.246
You've reached Legrand.

01:49:15.558 --> 01:49:19.552
We're open from 8.30 to 12.30
and from 1.30 to 6.

01:49:19.696 --> 01:49:21.256
Please leave a message.

01:49:22.067 --> 01:49:24.161
This is the Accounts Dept. at CGI.

01:49:24.905 --> 01:49:26.930
We have an order form

01:49:27.041 --> 01:49:29.669
from GMTR.
It means nothing to us.

01:49:30.011 --> 01:49:31.673
Please call me back.

01:49:31.813 --> 01:49:36.649
I'm Mr Valais.
The number is 01 75 77 77 77.

01:49:36.787 --> 01:49:38.084
Thanks, bye.

01:49:38.722 --> 01:49:40.189
Here's another one.

01:49:40.324 --> 01:49:41.986
Same signature.

01:49:43.128 --> 01:49:44.926
What's he playing at?

01:49:59.784 --> 01:50:01.308
Hello, Mr Legrand here.

01:50:01.619 --> 01:50:05.580
You left me a message
about an invoice for Highway 61.

01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:10.653
I deal with someone
from your company. Or rather, GMTR.

01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:15.362
Yes, that's right. Philippe Miller.

01:50:24.416 --> 01:50:25.644
What?

01:50:30.224 --> 01:50:31.349
The agency sent the wages.

01:50:32.293 --> 01:50:34.158
It's the last time, Philippe.

01:50:35.197 --> 01:50:36.755
On Monday,
the bills'll be unpaid.

01:50:37.633 --> 01:50:39.033
We'll have finished then.

01:50:40.603 --> 01:50:42.595
Try to stall them with that.

01:50:45.242 --> 01:50:46.403
Here...

01:50:47.246 --> 01:50:49.111
Come on, move it.

01:50:49.816 --> 01:50:51.078
Move all this!

01:50:51.218 --> 01:50:53.153
C'mon, guys, we gotta finish!

01:50:55.124 --> 01:50:56.284
Here, Lionel.

01:50:56.425 --> 01:50:57.949
Frédéric.

01:51:06.238 --> 01:51:07.866
- Thanks.
- Come with me.

01:51:08.041 --> 01:51:10.874
Louis, he'll be in charge
of an excavator tonight.

01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:14.741
We must finish tonight.

01:51:24.761 --> 01:51:27.158
I just spoke to the people at CGI.

01:51:30.461 --> 01:51:32.860
They said
you gave me a false order form,

01:51:33.829 --> 01:51:36.294
that there's no construction
in the area.

01:51:36.795 --> 01:51:38.693
The work doesn't exist.

01:51:43.428 --> 01:51:46.053
So, none of this exists?

01:51:46.261 --> 01:51:49.693
I think it does exist.
They're your machines.

01:51:50.494 --> 01:51:53.482
So, I don't exist either?
You're talking to no-one!

01:51:53.894 --> 01:51:55.053
No-one!

01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:01.487
Here, Bernard.

01:52:15.393 --> 01:52:17.019
Let's go to your office.

01:52:17.293 --> 01:52:20.453
If it doesn't rain,
we'll finish tonight. What do you want?

01:52:20.693 --> 01:52:21.785
Want us to stop?

01:52:26.893 --> 01:52:29.324
Guys, we gotta finish tonight.

01:52:29.993 --> 01:52:31.618
So, who wants to carry on?

01:52:33.626 --> 01:52:34.853
We carry on!

01:52:40.858 --> 01:52:43.051
There we go, the discussion's over.

01:53:18.824 --> 01:53:21.654
Hello. I'm Daniel Barraux,
Operations Manager.

01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:24.083
I didn't understand my assistant...

01:53:24.890 --> 01:53:26.151
Let me explain.

01:53:27.389 --> 01:53:29.787
You're one of our works managers?

01:53:30.222 --> 01:53:31.222
Not exactly.

01:53:40.824 --> 01:53:41.824
There...

01:53:42.823 --> 01:53:45.220
In the beginning,
there was a beetle problem.

01:53:46.123 --> 01:53:47.180
A what?

01:53:49.389 --> 01:53:50.685
A beetle.

01:54:28.388 --> 01:54:31.149
In 90 days, we've managed
to go from here...

01:54:32.487 --> 01:54:33.487
to here.

01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:36.880
If it doesn't rain,
we should finish tonight.

01:54:37.521 --> 01:54:38.645
Finish what?

01:54:42.453 --> 01:54:44.477
You've built a section of highway?

01:54:44.753 --> 01:54:46.446
It'll be daylight in 3 hours.

01:54:47.153 --> 01:54:50.449
You went to CGI today?
What did they say?

01:54:51.887 --> 01:54:53.647
They said they trusted us.

01:54:56.619 --> 01:54:58.108
It mustn't rain.

01:55:00.686 --> 01:55:04.482
It should even end up
costing less than a normal project.

01:55:07.453 --> 01:55:09.714
What do you mean, "'normal project" '?

01:55:09.852 --> 01:55:12.045
Where's this road?
Where does it go?

01:55:18.686 --> 01:55:19.982
I don't know.

01:55:22.452 --> 01:55:23.748
Nowhere.

01:55:47.450 --> 01:55:49.110
Don't forget your seat belt.

01:56:09.450 --> 01:56:11.382
How did you get this paperwork?

01:56:12.083 --> 01:56:13.639
I just did.

01:56:38.416 --> 01:56:39.847
I'll tell 'em to stop.

01:56:39.983 --> 01:56:41.039
We keep going!

01:56:41.349 --> 01:56:43.610
- It's too dangerous.
- We keep going!

01:56:59.347 --> 01:57:01.438
I just want you to save my team.

01:57:02.881 --> 01:57:05.041
Because they trusted me.

01:57:05.515 --> 01:57:07.483
And because it's not their fault.

01:57:10.852 --> 01:57:12.682
I don't really matter.

01:57:54.982 --> 01:57:57.040
I was lucky to have met them.

01:57:59.852 --> 01:58:00.945
I was lucky...

01:58:20.767 --> 01:58:22.927
- Hang on...
- It hurts!

01:58:23.569 --> 01:58:24.627
It's stuck!

01:58:29.706 --> 01:58:30.729
There's gasoline!

01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:39.102
Don't leave me!

01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:50.420
Nicolas!

01:59:06.831 --> 01:59:07.889
Over there!

01:59:32.716 --> 01:59:35.116
He's upstairs?
We have to call the police.

01:59:35.718 --> 01:59:38.778
He's behind all the false order forms.

01:59:39.053 --> 01:59:40.644
We must file a complaint.

01:59:41.555 --> 01:59:43.044
He came of his own accord.

01:59:48.693 --> 01:59:50.626
Are those his papers?

01:59:53.129 --> 01:59:55.188
He's done a runner.

01:59:55.898 --> 01:59:57.797
What has he left behind?

02:00:07.573 --> 02:00:08.869
Thank you, boss

02:00:13.111 --> 02:00:14.873
We have to file a complaint.

02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:20.705
An unconscious burns victim
for shock treatment.

02:00:22.450 --> 02:00:23.450
Sit down.

02:00:23.584 --> 02:00:24.948
What'll they do to him?

02:00:28.053 --> 02:00:30.612
He shouldn't have been on his own.

02:00:31.988 --> 02:00:33.479
He won't die?

02:01:09.682 --> 02:01:11.478
Leave us alone.

02:01:11.850 --> 02:01:12.850
Miss?

02:01:16.752 --> 02:01:17.810
It's alright.

02:01:18.521 --> 02:01:21.590
He has extensive burns,
but he'll be OK.

02:01:31.801 --> 02:01:32.801
Gaby, don't!

02:01:33.162 --> 02:01:34.162
You fucker!

02:01:37.728 --> 02:01:39.499
Fucker!

02:01:39.788 --> 02:01:40.788
Crook!

02:01:40.865 --> 02:01:42.280
Sorry about that, boss.

02:01:44.129 --> 02:01:45.544
Why did you do this to us?

02:01:47.236 --> 02:01:48.305
Scumbag!

02:01:56.077 --> 02:01:57.077
- Sir.
- Well?

02:01:57.599 --> 02:01:59.338
He was at the hospital 2 hours ago.

02:01:59.532 --> 02:02:02.092
- What name do you know him by?
- Philippe Miller.

02:02:02.226 --> 02:02:04.214
- Is he armed?
- No idea.

02:02:04.349 --> 02:02:06.878
- Stop him by dawn.
- We'll try.

02:02:18.359 --> 02:02:19.838
This is the place, sir.

02:02:21.433 --> 02:02:23.107
I think he's long gone.

02:05:00.407 --> 02:05:03.162
After his last prison term,
"'Philippe Miller" 'disappeared.

02:05:03.291 --> 02:05:04.652
No-one knows where he is.

02:05:06.714 --> 02:05:07.994
When the "'real" ' work resumed,

02:05:08.045 --> 02:05:10.476
all the workers and suppliers
were rehired or compensated.

02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:14.595
Only the temping agency
filed a complaint.

02:05:16.285 --> 02:05:18.435
GMTR's work was deemed
to be in conformity

02:05:18.567 --> 02:05:20.274
by the Highways Department.

02:05:21.736 --> 02:05:23.789
The beetles were moved
to a nearby forest.

02:07:44.102 --> 02:07:46.416
