WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.233
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.233 --> 00:05.076
BEN TOOK MONEY
FROM A LOAN SHARK.

00:05.076 --> 00:06.177
IF YOU'RE NOT GOOD FOR IT,
I UNDERSTAND

00:06.177 --> 00:08.509
THAT PRETTY GIRLFRIEND OF YOURS
IS LOADED.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.442
JULIE HAD MORE THAN
ONE SURPRISE FOR SUSAN.

00:11.442 --> 00:12.613
I'M GIVING IT UP
FOR ADOPTION.

00:12.613 --> 00:13.784
WHAT?

00:13.784 --> 00:16.015
YOU SLAMMED YOUR DOORS
IN MY FACE!

00:16.015 --> 00:17.718
BREE REJECTED HER FRIENDS...

00:17.718 --> 00:19.390
LET GO OF ME!

00:19.390 --> 00:21.692
BUT IT WAS ORSON WHO CAME
TO HER RESCUE.
 (screaming)

00:21.692 --> 00:23.694
YOUR FRIENDS CALLED ME.

00:27.328 --> 00:32.563
(Mary Alice) ORSON HODGE
HAD ALWAYS KNOWN ONE THING...

00:32.563 --> 00:36.467
BREE VAN DE KAMP WAS
THE PERFECT WOMAN FOR HIM.

00:39.039 --> 00:44.375
WHEN HE WAS SICK,
SHE NURSED HIM BACK TO HEALTH.

00:44.375 --> 00:45.376
(clicks)

00:45.376 --> 00:47.248
WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED,

00:47.248 --> 00:50.551
SHE PROMISED TO WAIT FOR HIM.

00:52.323 --> 00:55.826
AND WHEN HE SUFFERED
A TERRIBLE INJURY,

01:07.498 --> 01:11.102
I'VE FOUND
THAT WHATEVER THE PROBLEM,

01:11.102 --> 01:13.744
A CUP OF TEA ALWAYS MAKES
THINGS A LITTLE BETTER.

01:13.744 --> 01:15.246
THANK YOU.

01:15.246 --> 01:16.847
(sighs)

01:16.847 --> 01:18.349
TO THINK,
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN THERE,

01:18.349 --> 01:20.651
WHAT THAT TERRIBLE MAN
MIGHT'VE DONE...

01:20.651 --> 01:22.213
DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT.

01:22.213 --> 01:24.185
YOU'RE SAFE NOW. I'M HERE.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.257
YOU REALLY ARE A GOOD FRIEND.

01:27.658 --> 01:30.261
PERHAPS MY ONLY ONE.

01:30.261 --> 01:32.193
WHAT A THING TO SAY.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.494
YOU'RE STILL CLOSE

01:33.494 --> 01:35.226
WITH GABRIELLE, LYNETTE,
AND SUSAN, AREN'T YOU?

01:37.298 --> 01:39.370
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

01:41.172 --> 01:43.304
WE'RE ESTRANGED.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.576
REALLY?

01:46.877 --> 01:48.839
I THOUGHT THE FOUR OF YOU
WERE INSEPARABLE.

01:48.839 --> 01:52.213
I KNOW, BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED
A FEW MONTHS AGO, AND...

01:52.213 --> 01:54.145
BREE?

01:54.145 --> 01:55.786
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

01:55.786 --> 01:58.149
AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

01:58.149 --> 02:00.591
I PROMISE YOU CAN TRUST ME.

02:00.591 --> 02:03.254
I DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW.

02:03.254 --> 02:06.257
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO STILL BELIEVES IN ME.

02:06.257 --> 02:08.329
AND I ALWAYS WILL.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.531
PLEASE, I CAN SEE
THIS IS TEARING YOU UP.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.903
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, TELL ME.

02:16.307 --> 02:18.609
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO...

02:21.272 --> 02:24.275
WE THREW A DINNER PARTY.

02:24.275 --> 02:27.278
(voice echoes) BUT BEFORE
THE GUESTS ARRIVED AT GABY'S,

02:27.278 --> 02:30.221
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED.

02:37.288 --> 02:40.831
ORSON, I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
SHOCKED, BUT PLEASE TALK TO ME.

02:40.831 --> 02:42.493
I AM SHOCKED.

02:42.493 --> 02:45.766
YOU AGREE TO HELP COVER UP
CARLOS' CRIME,

02:45.766 --> 02:49.200
AND THEN THEY JUST ABANDON YOU?
HOW CAN YOUR FRIENDS DO THAT?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.941
YOU'RE ANGRY AT THEM?

02:50.941 --> 02:52.343
YES.

02:52.343 --> 02:55.346
THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF YOU
AND THEN HUNG YOU OUT TO DRY.

02:55.346 --> 02:56.907
IT'S APPALLING.

02:56.907 --> 02:58.649
SO EVEN AFTER HEARING
WHAT I'VE DONE,

02:58.649 --> 03:00.681
YOU STILL BELIEVE IN ME?

03:00.681 --> 03:06.217
YES, ORSON HODGE KNEW THAT BREE
WAS THE PERFECT WOMAN FOR HIM.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.191
I BELIEVE IN YOU
MORE THAN EVER.

03:11.191 --> 03:15.666
HE HAD NO INTENTION
OF LETTING HER GO.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.210
LYNETTE SCAVO HAD DISCOVERED

03:30.210 --> 03:34.415
THE SILVER LINING
OF SEPARATION--

03:34.415 --> 03:36.947
SHARED CUSTODY.

03:40.821 --> 03:45.296
SHE HAD NO CHILD
DEMANDING HER ATTENTION...

03:57.468 --> 04:01.572
BUT LYNETTE FORGOT THAT WHEN
IT COMES TO BEING A MOTHER,

04:01.572 --> 04:03.344
YOU CAN RUN...

04:03.344 --> 04:05.346
(Preston) HEY, MOM!

04:05.346 --> 04:07.548
BUT YOU CAN NEVER HIDE.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.421
(chuckles) HEY, GUYS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:10.421 --> 04:13.253
NOTHING. JEEZ, DO WE NEED
A REASON TO BRING FLOWERS

04:13.253 --> 04:15.255
TO THE WOMAN WHO GAVE US LIFE?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.627
AW!

04:16.627 --> 04:18.329
SUITCASES?

04:18.329 --> 04:19.560
WHY ARE THERE SUITCASES?

04:21.392 --> 04:23.664
OKAY, WE HAD A LITTLE
DISAGREEMENT WITH OUR LANDLORD,

04:23.664 --> 04:26.637
AND WE WERE KIND OF EVICTED.

04:28.339 --> 04:29.640
(scoffs)

04:31.802 --> 04:33.404
NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!

04:33.404 --> 04:35.976
GO AWAY!
YOU ARE NOT MOVING BACK HERE.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.408
MOM, COME ON--

04:37.408 --> 04:38.849
I SPENT 18 YEARS
GETTING YOU OUT OF HERE.

04:38.849 --> 04:40.981
(strained voice) THERE'S NO DAMN
WAY I'M LETTING YOU BACK IN.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.354
(groans)

04:43.354 --> 04:45.055
OKAY, MOM.

04:45.055 --> 04:46.357
(lock clicks)

04:46.357 --> 04:47.718
WE UNDERSTAND.

04:47.718 --> 04:50.361
YEAH, WE HAVE TO LEARN
TO LIVE ON OUR OWN.

04:56.827 --> 04:59.470
(grunts and pants)

05:00.801 --> 05:01.832
NO.

05:01.832 --> 05:03.303
COME ON! JUST FOR A WEEK.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.506
I KNOW YOU GUYS.
A WEEK WOULD TURN INTO A YEAR,

05:05.506 --> 05:07.077
A YEAR INTO 20,

05:07.077 --> 05:08.839
AND PRETTY SOON, YOU'RE
TAKING ME OFF THE RESPIRATOR,

05:08.839 --> 05:10.781
SAYING "IT'S WHAT MOM
WOULD'VE WANTED."

05:13.344 --> 05:15.816
PLEASE LET US IN.
WE'RE CHILDREN OF DIVORCE.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.648
EXACTLY. GO TO YOUR DAD'S.

05:17.648 --> 05:19.650
BUT WE LIKE YOU SO MUCH MORE.

05:19.650 --> 05:21.822
DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.454
NO, SERIOUSLY, DAD HAS
THAT STUPID GIRLFRIEND.

05:23.454 --> 05:25.426
AND HE'S BEEN SO UNFAIR TO YOU.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.400
(lock clicks)

05:29.400 --> 05:31.662
YOU HAD ME
AT "STUPID GIRLFRIEND."

05:34.334 --> 05:35.436
OH! (chuckles)

05:35.436 --> 05:38.008
HEY, SWEETIE.
WHATCHA DOING?

05:38.008 --> 05:39.470
OH, THE ADOPTION AGENCY

05:39.470 --> 05:41.442
SENT ME A FEW MORE COUPLES
TO CHECK OUT.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.674
OKAY, THAT GUY'S GOT
SERIAL KILLER EYES.

05:43.674 --> 05:46.346
OH, HE DOES NOT.
THAT'S FROM THE FLASH.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.579
FINE. YOU WANT YOUR BABY
TO BE ON THE RUN.

05:48.579 --> 05:50.481
ANY OTHER CHOICES?
 (clicks key)

05:50.481 --> 05:51.622
I LIKE THEM.

05:51.622 --> 05:53.353
OH, GAY COUPLE.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.355
UH, THAT'S NOT A MAN.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.728
OH, TOO BAD.
THEY'RE GREAT WITH KIDS.

05:57.728 --> 06:00.491
OKAY, THAT'S IT. NOBODY'S EVER
GONNA BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.
 (refrigerator door
opens and closes)

06:00.491 --> 06:02.393
SO YOU'VE TOTALLY RULED OUT
KEEPING IT?

06:02.393 --> 06:03.594
YES, TOTALLY.

06:03.594 --> 06:05.436
AND I GET NO SAY
IN THE MATTER?

06:05.436 --> 06:06.397
NOW YOU'RE TALKIN'.

06:06.397 --> 06:07.468
(sighs)

06:09.700 --> 06:11.442
YOU NEED TO STOP
HASSLING HER.

06:11.442 --> 06:12.773
I JUST WISH THERE WAS
SOMETHING I COULD DO

06:12.773 --> 06:15.906
TO KEEP HER FROM GIVING
THIS BABY AWAY. (sighs)

06:17.508 --> 06:20.451
HEY, WHAT IF I TALK
TO THE FATHER?

06:20.451 --> 06:22.913
SUSAN--
 NO, DOES HE EVEN KNOW
THAT SHE'S DOING THIS?

06:22.913 --> 06:25.115
MAYBE IF I FIND HIM,

06:25.115 --> 06:27.918
I TELL HIM,
AND THEN HE'LL STOP HER.

06:27.918 --> 06:30.491
THAT'S A VERY BAD IDEA.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.893
SAYS YOU.
 WHAT DO YOUR FRIENDS THINK?

06:32.893 --> 06:35.826
I DON'T KNOW.
NOT ALLOWED TO TELL THEM.

06:35.826 --> 06:37.828
JULIE WANTS TO KEEP THIS
A BIG SECRET.

06:37.828 --> 06:41.131
SO YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE
I'M ALLOWED TO TALK TO,

06:41.131 --> 06:43.974
AND I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU WOULD AGREE WITH ME.

06:43.974 --> 06:46.477
(sighs) LOOK,
THIS IS KILLING ME, TOO.

06:46.477 --> 06:47.808
BUT IT'S HER DECISION.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.780
YOU KEEP PUSHING HER,

06:49.780 --> 06:52.182
IT'S NOT JUST A GRANDKID
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE.

06:55.486 --> 06:57.988
(sighs)

06:57.988 --> 06:59.920
GIRLS, LET'S GO HOME NOW.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.822
(children shouting playfully)

07:01.822 --> 07:03.854
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA COUNT TO THREE.

07:03.854 --> 07:05.596
ONE...

07:05.596 --> 07:08.428
TWO...

07:08.428 --> 07:10.661
TWO AND A HALF...

07:10.661 --> 07:12.863
TWO AND THREE-QUARTERS...

07:12.863 --> 07:15.566
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANY MORE FRACTIONS, DO YOU?

07:15.566 --> 07:17.207
ALL RIGHT,
THAT IS IT, SMART-ASS.

07:17.207 --> 07:18.839
I AM CALLING YOUR FATHER.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.511
AND YOU BETTER WATCH OUT,

07:20.511 --> 07:23.443
BECAUSE THIS PHONE HAS
A WHUP-ASS APP.
 (cell phone beeps)

07:23.443 --> 07:25.876
(cell phone rings)

07:25.876 --> 07:28.849
(ring, beep)

07:28.849 --> 07:31.622
HI, SWEETIE. I AM JUST
GETTING READY TO MEDITATE.

07:31.622 --> 07:32.683
CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

07:32.683 --> 07:34.785
NO! NO, NO, NO. ENOUGH
NURTURING YOUR INNER CHILD.

07:34.785 --> 07:36.456
I NEED YOU TO COME HOME

07:36.456 --> 07:38.458
AND WHACK A COUPLE
OF YOUR OUTER ONES.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.892
I CAN'T COME HOME UNTIL
MY TREATMENT IS COMPLETE.

07:41.892 --> 07:44.034
THAT'S ANOTHER 16 DAYS.

07:44.034 --> 07:45.796
IN 16 DAYS,
I CAN'T GUARANTEE

07:45.796 --> 07:47.467
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE CHILDREN
TO COME HOME TO.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.640
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE THINGS
THAT ARE GOING THROUGH MY MIND.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.001
Gaby.

07:51.001 --> 07:53.103
I'M JUST SAYING, I'VE GOT ROCKS,
THEY'VE GOT BACKPACKS,

07:53.103 --> 07:55.245
AND THERE'S A LAKE
ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL.

07:55.245 --> 07:58.679
LOOK... (sighs) I KNOW
THAT IT HAS BEEN TOUGH ON YOU

07:58.679 --> 08:00.551
WITH ME BEING IN REHAB.

08:00.551 --> 08:03.483
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
I AM LOSING MY MIND.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.656
I'M LOOKING AFTER YOUR BUSINESS,

08:05.656 --> 08:07.858
I'M RUNNING THE HOUSE,
I'M TRYING

08:07.858 --> 08:08.859
to keep the girls in line.

08:08.859 --> 08:10.691
LET ME TALK TO JUANITA.

08:10.691 --> 08:14.565
(sighs)
JUANITA, TALK TO YOUR FATHER.

08:14.565 --> 08:15.766
HEY, DADDY.

08:26.537 --> 08:28.579
ANYTHING BITING?

08:28.579 --> 08:30.581
KAREN KICKED ME OUT.

08:30.581 --> 08:32.042
OH, MY GOD. WHAT HAPPENED?

08:32.042 --> 08:33.513
I DON'T KNOW.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.817
SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING
I DO LATELY GETS HER MAD.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.889
"LATELY"?
SHE'S A GROUCHY OLD LADY.

08:38.889 --> 08:41.520
THAT'S WHY WE LOVE
AND FEAR HER.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.923
NAH, THIS IS DIFFERENT.

08:42.923 --> 08:45.956
I THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE
FOR HER TO COOL DOWN.

08:45.956 --> 08:49.930
AND IN THE MEANTIME,
I GOT NO PLACE TO GO.

08:51.602 --> 08:55.235
YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S FUN
TO STAY AT THE Y.M.C.A.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.707
NOT FOR ME.

08:56.707 --> 08:57.908
I SLEPT THERE ONCE.

08:57.908 --> 09:02.112
WOKE UP AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING
WITH A GUY MASSAGING MY FEET.

09:02.112 --> 09:04.615
WELL, AT LEAST
SHE GAVE ME MY FISHING POLE

09:04.615 --> 09:06.316
SO I WON'T STARVE TO DEATH.

09:06.316 --> 09:09.650
THE CHURCH HAS A KOI POND,
RIGHT?

09:09.650 --> 09:12.222
THERE'S THAT FRONTIER SPIRIT.

09:12.222 --> 09:15.856
OKAY, GABY. IT'S OBVIOUS YOU'RE
NOT PICKING UP MY HINTS.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.858
NO, I AM.
I'M JUST IGNORING THEM.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.760
(sighs)

09:19.760 --> 09:21.291
LOOK, I'D OFFER YOU A ROOM
AT MY PLACE,

09:21.291 --> 09:23.764
BUT MY KIDS ARE
YOUNG AND LOUD--

09:23.764 --> 09:25.866
AND I'M OLD AND DEAF.
IT'S PERFECT.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.598
THANKS, GABY.

09:27.598 --> 09:29.269
I'D ASK BREE
IF I COULD CRASH WITH HER,

09:29.269 --> 09:31.071
BUT SHE'S GOT ORSON
OVER THERE.

09:35.746 --> 09:37.808
(Carlos) You need to be
helping your mother out more.
 (sighs)

09:37.808 --> 09:39.710
You know,
helping around the house--
 THANKS, HONEY.
YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP.

09:39.710 --> 09:41.281
I GOTTA CALL THE GIRLS. BYE.
 Gaby!

09:41.281 --> 09:42.783
(beeps)

09:45.786 --> 09:48.588
LADIES.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.960
I SAW YOU THROUGH THE WINDOW

09:49.960 --> 09:52.122
AND JUST HAD TO COME OUT
TO SAY HELLO.

09:52.122 --> 09:53.664
ORSON.

09:53.664 --> 09:54.695
YOU'RE BACK.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.196
I AM BACK.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.068
KEENLY OBSERVED, SUSAN.

09:58.068 --> 10:00.671
SHE JUST MEANT IT'S UNEXPECTED,

10:00.671 --> 10:02.102
SEEING YOU AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.874
(clicks tongue)
BUILDING A RAMP.

10:03.874 --> 10:05.075
YOU AND BREE--

10:05.075 --> 10:07.678
GONNA BE SPENDING
MORE TIME TOGETHER? YES.

10:07.678 --> 10:11.812
AS YOU KNOW, SHE'S BEEN GOING
THROUGH A ROUGH PATCH OF LATE.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.383
THE OTHER NIGHT,
SHE WAS AT A BAR,

10:13.383 --> 10:14.985
AND THERE WAS AN INCIDENT.

10:14.985 --> 10:16.216
AN INCIDENT?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.919
SOMETHING UNPLEASANT
WITH AN AGGRESSIVE STRANGER.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.020
(gasps)

10:20.020 --> 10:21.621
SHE'S FINE.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.323
THANK GOD I HAPPENED
TO BE DRIVING BY.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.925
THANK GOD IS RIGHT.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.827
BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
SHE'S STILL A LITTLE SHAKEN UP,

10:26.827 --> 10:28.729
SO I'M GONNA BE SPENDING
SOME TIME HERE

10:28.729 --> 10:30.030
UNTIL THE DUST SETTLES.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.702
CAN WE SEE HER?

10:31.702 --> 10:36.737
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
SHE'S UP FOR THAT YET.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.709
WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

10:38.709 --> 10:40.671
YEAH, LAST TIME WE SAW HER,

10:40.671 --> 10:42.773
IT DIDN'T GO SO WELL.

10:42.773 --> 10:45.716
WILL YOU AT LEAST TELL HER WE
LOVE HER AND WE'RE HERE FOR HER?

10:45.716 --> 10:47.918
I'LL BE SURE
TO RELAY THE MESSAGE.

10:47.918 --> 10:49.750
THANKS.
 BYE.

10:56.126 --> 10:57.287
(door opens)

10:57.287 --> 10:59.329
WHO WERE YOU, UH,
TALKING TO?

10:59.329 --> 11:01.331
JUST THE MEN INSTALLING
MY RAMP.

11:01.331 --> 11:02.432
OH.

11:02.432 --> 11:05.035
NOW HOW ABOUT I MAKE US
SOME LUNCH?

11:12.042 --> 11:15.746
NO, YOU'VE GOTTA DELIVER
THAT CEMENT TOMORROW.

11:15.746 --> 11:17.908
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHY BEN DIDN'T PAY YOU,

11:17.908 --> 11:19.750
BUT I DROVE BACK TO THE SITE.

11:19.750 --> 11:22.212
I'M GONNA FIND YOUR CHECK,
AND I'LL GET IT TO YOU TONIGHT.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.158
HEY!

11:28.158 --> 11:30.220
HEY, THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY!

11:50.310 --> 11:52.883
(grunts)

11:52.883 --> 11:54.484
(grunts)

11:55.746 --> 11:58.048
WHAT THE HELL?!

11:58.048 --> 12:01.752
DAMN IT, MIKE.
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO COME BACK?

12:13.403 --> 12:14.865
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

12:14.865 --> 12:16.406
THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

12:16.406 --> 12:19.369
YOU ALMOST KILLED ME,
SO I SAY IT DOES.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.274
I'M IN OVER MY HEAD
WITH THIS LOAN SHARK,

12:24.274 --> 12:27.117
AND HIS LATE FEE
COMES WITH A CROWBAR.

12:27.117 --> 12:29.749
SO... SOME OF THIS EQUIPMENT
BLOWS UP,

12:29.749 --> 12:31.952
THE INSURANCE COMPANY
WRITES ME A BIG CHECK,

12:31.952 --> 12:34.384
AND I'M ABLE TO KEEP MY KNEES
A LITTLE LONGER.

12:34.384 --> 12:35.956
THAT'S FRAUD, BEN.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.829
I KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED. I JUST
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

12:38.829 --> 12:40.030
WELL, NOT THIS.

12:40.030 --> 12:41.962
THEN WHAT?
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN TRYING

12:41.962 --> 12:44.334
TO FIX THIS FOR WEEKS, MIKE,
BUT IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE.

12:44.334 --> 12:46.366
I'VE LOST EVERY CENT I HAVE.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.938
I'VE LOST RENEE.

12:47.938 --> 12:51.401
(sighs) I'VE...
I'VE SCREWED EVERYTHING UP.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.475
ARE YOU OKAY?

12:55.475 --> 12:59.109
MY CHEST FEELS TIGHT.
THAT'S NOT GOOD, IS IT?

12:59.109 --> 13:00.350
NO, IT'S NOT.

13:00.350 --> 13:02.813
OH.

13:03.914 --> 13:06.216
LET'S GET YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.
COME ON.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.119
THANKS.

13:09.119 --> 13:10.320
YEAH.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.962
I SEE THE TWINS ARE HOME.

13:11.962 --> 13:13.864
REALLY? WHAT GAVE IT AWAY?

13:13.864 --> 13:17.297
GUYS! GET YOUR BOXERS
OFF THE TABLE!

13:17.297 --> 13:18.899
(Preston) THEY'RE NOT MINE.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.971
(Porter) ME NEITHER.
I'M WEARING...

13:20.971 --> 13:22.332
OH, WAIT.

13:22.332 --> 13:23.473
BE RIGHT DOWN.

13:23.473 --> 13:25.135
I SWEAR,
THEY'RE LIKE TERMITES.

13:25.135 --> 13:27.337
JUST WHEN I THINK
I'VE GOTTEN RID OF 'EM...

13:27.337 --> 13:29.980
AT LEAST THEY COME BACK TO YOU
WHEN THEY'RE IN TROUBLE.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.481
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING?

13:31.481 --> 13:32.582
YES.

13:32.582 --> 13:34.915
BECAUSE THEY LISTEN TO YOU.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.546
THEY LET YOU HELP THEM.

13:36.546 --> 13:39.019
THEY DON'T KEEP THEIR PROBLEMS
SECRET FOR SIX MONTHS

13:39.019 --> 13:40.590
AND THEN COMPLETELY
SHUT YOU OUT,

13:40.590 --> 13:43.023
IGNORING ALL YOUR ADVICE.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.956
WHAT'S WRONG?

13:45.956 --> 13:47.858
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TELL YOU...

13:47.858 --> 13:48.959
HUH.

13:48.959 --> 13:50.530
THAT JULIE'S PREGNANT,

13:50.530 --> 13:53.003
AND SHE'S GIVING THE BABY UP
FOR ADOPTION.

13:53.003 --> 13:55.835
WOW. WHERE'S THE DAD
IN ALL THIS?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.207
"WHO'S THE DAD?"
IS MORE LIKE IT.

13:57.207 --> 13:58.869
SHE WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

13:58.869 --> 14:00.871
I'M SORRY.

14:00.871 --> 14:02.342
(sighs)

14:02.342 --> 14:04.474
YOU KNOW,
RIGHT WHEN JULIE WAS BORN,

14:04.474 --> 14:07.217
THEY TOOK HER AWAY TO GIVE HER
A VITAMIN SHOT,

14:07.217 --> 14:11.281
AND THAT WAS THE LONGEST HOUR
OF MY LIFE.

14:11.281 --> 14:15.425
AND NOW SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
GIVING THE BABY AWAY FOR GOOD.

14:15.425 --> 14:18.558
I MEAN, SHE JUST HAS NO IDEA
HOW HARD THAT'S GONNA BE.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.330
DO YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO HER?

14:20.330 --> 14:22.432
SHE MIGHT REACT DIFFERENTLY
TO SOMEONE WHO'S NOT HER MOM.

14:22.432 --> 14:23.533
NO.

14:23.533 --> 14:26.366
IN FACT, YOU CAN'T
EVEN TELL HER I TOLD YOU.

14:26.366 --> 14:30.540
JULIE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE
KNOWING SHE'S PREGNANT.

14:35.605 --> 14:38.478
OH, MORNIN'.
HOW'D YOU SLEEP?

14:38.478 --> 14:41.381
TERRIBLY. I'D ASK YOU,
BUT I ALREADY KNOW.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.414
HOW CAN SOMEONE USE THE BATHROOM
FIVE TIMES IN ONE NIGHT?

14:44.414 --> 14:45.986
HEART OF A LION,

14:45.986 --> 14:48.288
BLADDER OF A FRUIT FLY.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.459
OH.

14:49.459 --> 14:51.591
WELL, YOU DO KNOW THEY MAKE
BATHROBES WITH BELTS ON THEM?

14:51.591 --> 14:53.063
I'M SORRY.

14:53.063 --> 14:55.565
I DIDN'T MEAN TO LET
THE OLD KOMODO DRAGON

14:55.565 --> 14:57.527
PEEK OUT OF THE CAGE.

14:57.527 --> 14:59.399
DON'T MENTION IT...

14:59.399 --> 15:01.231
EVER AGAIN.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.575
GIRLS, SCHOOL STARTS
IN 20 MINUTES.

15:05.575 --> 15:06.636
WHY AREN'T YOU DRESSED?

15:06.636 --> 15:08.338
'CAUSE THEN WE'D BE READY,

15:08.338 --> 15:09.980
THEN WE'D HAVE TO GO,
AND WE HATE SCHOOL.

15:09.980 --> 15:11.311
HERE. I MADE BREAKFAST.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.183
OOH. TOAST.

15:13.183 --> 15:15.185
LET ME KNOW WHEN
YOUR COOKBOOK COMES OUT.

15:16.646 --> 15:17.687
(Celia) MM.

15:17.687 --> 15:20.220
(scoffs) OKAY.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.192
LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE
GETTING YOU OFF MY COUCH

15:22.192 --> 15:24.124
AND BACK WITH THE LADY YOU LOVE.
WHAT'S OUR PLAN?

15:24.124 --> 15:26.326
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
I'VE BEEN CALLING ALL MORNING.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.098
SHE DOESN'T EVEN
PICK UP THE PHONE.

15:28.098 --> 15:29.559
ROY, YOU'VE GOT TO PUT
SOME EFFORT INTO IT.

15:29.559 --> 15:32.362
WOO HER. MARCH OVER THERE
AND SWEEP HER OFF HER FEET.

15:32.362 --> 15:34.164
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK.

15:34.164 --> 15:35.465
NO, NO,
HERE'S WHAT DOESN'T WORK--

15:35.465 --> 15:37.937
ME BEING AWAKENED AT 2:00 A.M.
BY THAT PEP TALK

15:37.937 --> 15:40.340
YOU GIVE YOUR DRAGON
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO PEE.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.541
OH.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.513
YOU WANT ME OUT.

15:43.513 --> 15:44.714
(sighs) I'M SORRY.

15:44.714 --> 15:47.177
IT'S JUST, MY LIFE'S
REALLY STRESSFUL RIGHT NOW.

15:47.177 --> 15:48.418
NO APOLOGIES.

15:48.418 --> 15:51.581
IT WAS VERY KIND OF YOU
TO TAKE ME IN.

15:51.581 --> 15:54.624
I'M SURE I CAN FIND
ANOTHER PLACE TO STAY.

15:56.656 --> 16:00.030
OH, YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
I TOLD YOU TO GET DRESSED!

16:00.030 --> 16:01.261
I DON'T WANNA.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.133
DAMN IT, GIRLS!
LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER.

16:03.133 --> 16:06.136
YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.
YOU'RE NOT MY DAD.

16:06.136 --> 16:10.440
EXACTLY. SO I DON'T GIVE A CRAP
IF YOU LIVE OR DIE.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.473
HERE. YOU SEE THE NOTCHES
ON THIS BELT?

16:13.473 --> 16:17.047
THOSE ARE ALL THE MEN I KILLED
IN KOREA.

16:17.047 --> 16:19.979
FIRST TIME,
IT WAS A LITTLE ROUGH,

16:19.979 --> 16:24.384
BUT AFTER THAT, YOU DEVELOP
A TASTE FOR BLOOD.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.486
SO LISTEN UP, SOLDIERS.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.458
YOU ARE GONNA MARCH UP
THOSE STAIRS,

16:28.458 --> 16:32.522
PUT ON YOUR SCHOOL GEAR,
AND BE BACK DOWN BY 8:00 SHARP.

16:32.522 --> 16:34.524
IS THAT CLEAR?

16:34.524 --> 16:37.567
ALL RIGHT. NOW MOVE!

16:40.030 --> 16:42.202
WELL, I GUESS I BETTER
GO START PACKING.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.274
NO! NO, NO, NO, NO.

16:44.274 --> 16:47.377
I CAN'T SEND A WAR VETERAN
OUT ON THE STREET.

16:47.377 --> 16:51.281
AS LONG AS AMERICA IS FREE,
YOU HAVE A PLACE HERE.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.514
(clink)

16:56.346 --> 16:57.587
LET ME FINISH.

16:57.587 --> 16:59.389
SEE, THIS IS
WHY I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

16:59.389 --> 17:01.191
I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA FREAK.

17:01.191 --> 17:02.622
BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOUR DECISION.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.324
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU'RE THE FATHER.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.695
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT
DOING THIS ON THE PHONE.

17:06.695 --> 17:08.627
JUST MEET ME AT THE COFFEE CUP
IN HALF AN HOUR.

17:08.627 --> 17:09.699
(beep)

17:12.632 --> 17:15.635
(whooshing)

17:15.635 --> 17:18.637
(indistinct conversations)

17:36.186 --> 17:37.587
HEY.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.161
YOU USING THIS CHAIR?

17:41.161 --> 17:44.334
UH, NO, GO AHEAD.

17:44.334 --> 17:45.665
(chair clatters)

17:48.138 --> 17:49.369
MRS. DELFINO?

17:49.369 --> 17:51.741
(whispering) OH, PORTER. SHH.

17:51.741 --> 17:53.643
I DON'T WANT TO JULIE
TO KNOW I'M HERE.

17:53.643 --> 17:54.574
WHY NOT?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.646
OH, SHE'S MEETING A GUY.

17:56.646 --> 17:58.448
I NEED TO FIND OUT
WHO IT IS.

17:58.448 --> 18:00.580
(Julie) OH, HEY, PORTER.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.682
OVER HERE.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.784
MOM?

18:10.290 --> 18:11.861
OH, MY GOD.

18:11.861 --> 18:13.393
YOU'RE THE GUY.

18:14.824 --> 18:16.396
(gasps)

18:16.396 --> 18:21.201
PORTER SCAVO IS THE FATHER
OF MY GRANDCHILD.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.502
OH!

18:26.676 --> 18:27.777
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SPIED ON ME.

18:27.777 --> 18:29.479
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SHACKED UP

18:29.479 --> 18:32.212
WITH A KID YOU USED TO BABYSIT.
 CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING?

18:32.212 --> 18:33.683
ARE YOU TWO IN A RELATIONSHIP?

18:33.683 --> 18:35.515
OH, GOD, NO.
NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.147
I CAN HEAR YOU!

18:37.147 --> 18:39.489
WE RAN INTO EACH OTHER
AT A BAR, OKAY?

18:39.489 --> 18:40.550
AND I-I'D JUST BROKEN UP
WITH WILL,

18:40.550 --> 18:41.821
AND I WAS FEELING
REALLY DEPRESSED,

18:41.821 --> 18:43.623
AND PORTER BOUGHT ME
A FEW DRINKS.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.794
AND THEN WE WENT BACK
TO MY PLACE AND--

18:44.794 --> 18:46.756
APPARENTLY, FORGOT EVERYTHING
I TAUGHT YOU ABOUT CONDOMS.

18:46.756 --> 18:48.258
NO.

18:48.258 --> 18:49.399
IT BROKE.

18:49.399 --> 18:50.800
OH! UGH!

18:50.800 --> 18:53.403
WHAT'D YOU EXPECT?
IT'S PORTER SCAVO.

18:53.403 --> 18:55.535
HE PROBABLY FOUND IT ON
THE FLOOR OF A MOVIE THEATER.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.136
(knock on door)

18:57.136 --> 18:58.908
UGH.

19:01.411 --> 19:02.542
(door opens)

19:04.174 --> 19:05.515
GREAT.

19:05.515 --> 19:07.477
WELL, YOU BETTER GET USED TO IT.

19:07.477 --> 19:10.380
THIS SNOT-NOSED KID,

19:10.380 --> 19:12.682
THE BOY WHO GOT HIS HEAD
STUCK IN OUR FENCE,

19:12.682 --> 19:14.284
IS THE FATHER OF YOUR BABY.

19:14.284 --> 19:16.226
NO, THE FATHER WILL BE
AN ADOPTIVE PARENT

19:16.226 --> 19:17.557
WHO HAS GONE THROUGH
EXTENSIVE INTERVIEWS

19:17.557 --> 19:19.789
AND A BACKGROUND CHECK.
 BOTH OF YOU, STOP.

19:19.789 --> 19:22.792
NO MORE FIGHTING. ALL THIS
STRESS IS BAD FOR MY BABY.

19:22.792 --> 19:24.794
(scoffs) YOUR BABY?

19:24.794 --> 19:27.197
YEAH. I WANNA KEEP IT.

19:27.197 --> 19:28.598
YOU DO?

19:28.598 --> 19:29.899
YEAH.

19:29.899 --> 19:31.741
OH, I WAS JUST DOING
SOME RESEARCH ONLINE.

19:31.741 --> 19:33.703
YOU MIGHT WANT TO EAT SOMETHING
CALLED FOLIC ACID,

19:33.703 --> 19:35.805
OR THE BABY COULD HAVE
A WEIRD HEAD.
 YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

19:35.805 --> 19:38.608
THERE IS NO WAY WE ARE
RAISING A BABY TOGETHER.

19:38.608 --> 19:39.509
THEN I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

19:39.509 --> 19:41.311
OH, PLEASE. YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

19:41.311 --> 19:43.583
WELL, UH, LEGALLY...

19:43.583 --> 19:44.614
HE CAN.

19:44.614 --> 19:47.417
I MEAN, FATHERS DO HAVE RIGHTS.

19:47.417 --> 19:48.788
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:48.788 --> 19:50.720
NOTHING.
I'M JUST REMINDING PORTER

19:50.720 --> 19:52.692
THAT HE DOES HAVE A SAY IN THIS

19:52.692 --> 19:55.365
AND LETTING HIM KNOW THAT
IF HE WANTS TO RAISE THE BABY,

19:55.365 --> 19:56.926
HE'LL HAVE MY SUPPORT

19:56.926 --> 19:58.698
AND UNLIMITED BABYSITTING.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.870
NO! NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

20:00.870 --> 20:02.632
STAY OUT OF IT!

20:04.534 --> 20:07.477
PORTER, IF YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS, I WILL HELP YOU.

20:07.477 --> 20:08.838
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED.

20:08.838 --> 20:11.241
THANK YOU.

20:11.241 --> 20:13.583
COULD YOU TELL MY MOM?

20:15.615 --> 20:17.317
OH, HEY.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.549
I BROUGHT THOSE CONTRACTS.
YOUR SECRETARY SAYS

20:19.549 --> 20:21.491
TO SIGN THEM SO I CAN
BRING 'EM BACK TOMORROW.

20:21.491 --> 20:22.652
(clicks tongue) AW.
THANKS, BABE.

20:22.652 --> 20:24.394
LISTEN,
I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND

20:24.394 --> 20:28.428
I GET HOW MUCH YOU'VE HAD TO DO
WITH ME IN HERE.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.829
BUT I TALKED TO MY COUNSELOR,

20:29.829 --> 20:33.363
AND HE SAID THAT I DON'T HAVE
TO DO THE FULL 16 DAYS.

20:33.363 --> 20:36.466
I CAN GET OUT A FEW DAYS EARLY,
HELP OUT WITH THE GIRLS.

20:36.466 --> 20:38.708
OH, HONEY,
YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

20:38.708 --> 20:39.809
REALLY?

20:39.809 --> 20:41.611
BECAUSE YESTERDAY
ON THE PHONE,

20:41.611 --> 20:43.613
YOU HAD THAT
WHOLE DROWNING FANTASY.

20:43.613 --> 20:45.745
I KNOW,
BUT I GOT HELP AT HOME.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.448
WHAT, A NANNY?
 BETTER. A SERGEANT.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.650
I GOT ROY.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.452
McCLUSKEY KICKED HIM OUT,
SO I TOOK HIM IN.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.624
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW
HE'S GETTING THE GIRLS IN LINE.

20:54.624 --> 20:56.025
McCLUSKEY KICKED HIM OUT?
WHY?

20:56.025 --> 20:59.028
WHO KNOWS? BY THE WAY,
BIG OIL STAIN IN THE GARAGE?

20:59.028 --> 21:00.760
HE HAD THE GIRLS IN THERE
ALL AFTERNOON.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.392
(singsongy) IT'S GONE!

21:02.392 --> 21:05.365
WOW. THOSE TWO SEEMED
SO PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.397
AND IT'S PERFECT FOR ME!

21:07.397 --> 21:08.768
ROY'S A GENIUS.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.999
SIMPLY BY YELLING
AT THE GIRLS

21:09.999 --> 21:11.471
AND THREATENING 'EM
WITH VIOLENCE,

21:11.471 --> 21:13.673
HE HAS MADE OUR HOME
A HAPPY PLACE.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.305
BUT AREN'T YOU
THE LEAST BIT INTERESTED

21:15.305 --> 21:16.676
IN WHAT DROVE THEM APART?

21:16.676 --> 21:18.678
I KNOW WHAT'S GONNA
DRIVE US APART--

21:18.678 --> 21:20.980
IF YOU KEEP ASKING
THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS!

21:24.584 --> 21:26.616
(doorbell rings)

21:26.616 --> 21:29.619
HEY, I, UH, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT BEN.

21:29.619 --> 21:33.393
AFTER WHAT HE DID TO ME,
I DON'T CARE.

21:33.393 --> 21:36.396
HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.297
HE IS?

21:38.297 --> 21:40.330
(sighs) WHAT HAPPENED?

21:40.330 --> 21:41.731
OH, HE WAS AT THE SITE
LAST NIGHT.

21:41.731 --> 21:44.303
HE STARTED HAVING CHEST PAINS.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.506
THEY SAY IT'S NOT
A HEART ATTACK,

21:46.506 --> 21:48.808
BUT THEY WANT TO MONITOR HIM
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.711
BUT BEN'S A YOUNG GUY.
HE'S HEALTHY.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.082
WHY IS HE HAVING CHEST PAINS?

21:53.082 --> 21:55.815
OH, HE'S BEEN UNDER
A LOT OF STRESS.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.787
OH, IS IT THE MONEY THING?

21:57.787 --> 21:59.789
YEAH.
IT'S WORSE THAN YOU THINK.

21:59.789 --> 22:02.622
HE'S IN PRETTY DEEP
TO THIS... GUY.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.924
GUY? WHAT KIND OF GUY?

22:04.924 --> 22:07.697
LET'S JUST SAY HE'S NOT EXACTLY
A LICENSED BANKER,

22:07.697 --> 22:10.700
WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.662
BEN'S IN TROUBLE.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.508
THIS IS NICE.

22:18.508 --> 22:19.939
IT'S LIKE YOU NEVER LEFT,

22:19.939 --> 22:21.811
LIKE ALL
OF THOSE TERRIBLE THINGS

22:21.811 --> 22:23.543
I TOLD YOU ABOUT NEVER HAPPENED,

22:23.543 --> 22:26.115
AND WE'VE BEEN HERE
IN THIS KITCHEN,

22:26.115 --> 22:27.817
SAFE.

22:27.817 --> 22:30.079
IT DOES FEEL
VERY COMFORTABLE.

22:30.079 --> 22:32.582
WE'RE LIKE
A PAIR OF OLD JEANS.

22:32.582 --> 22:34.023
WELL, WE CAN ONLY ASSUME,
SINCE NEITHER ONE OF US

22:34.023 --> 22:36.486
HAS EVER OWNED A PAIR
OF OLD JEANS.
 (chuckles)

22:38.057 --> 22:39.829
I WANT TO RUN
SOMETHING BY YOU.

22:39.829 --> 22:41.591
OF COURSE.

22:41.591 --> 22:43.693
GIVEN EVERYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH LATELY,

22:43.693 --> 22:45.735
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT
A CHANGE OF SCENERY?

22:45.735 --> 22:47.136
HOW BIG OF A CHANGE?

22:47.136 --> 22:48.868
MAINE.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.442
MY AUNT RECENTLY PASSED.

22:52.442 --> 22:53.773
OH.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.805
AH, NO NEED FOR SYMPATHY.
SHE WAS A WRETCHED WOMAN.

22:55.805 --> 22:57.707
SHE LEFT HER COASTAL CABIN
TO ME.

22:57.707 --> 22:59.879
WELL, IT MIGHT BE NICE TO GET
AWAY FOR A COUPLE WEEKS.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.951
YES.
AND IF YOU LIKE IT,

23:01.951 --> 23:04.884
MAYBE WE COULD MAKE IT
MORE PERMANENT,

23:04.884 --> 23:07.457
YOU KNOW, MOVE THERE.

23:07.457 --> 23:08.618
(sighs)

23:08.618 --> 23:11.060
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT US
GETTING BACK TOGETHER?

23:11.060 --> 23:13.523
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE
I'M READY FOR THAT.

23:13.523 --> 23:17.467
ALL I'M TALKING ABOUT
IS A FRESH START,

23:17.467 --> 23:19.499
A NEW CHAPTER IN YOUR LIFE.

23:19.499 --> 23:22.572
I DON'T KNOW, ORSON.
IT'S SUCH A MASSIVE CHANGE.

23:22.572 --> 23:25.635
I'D BE SAYING GOOD-BYE
TO ALL MY FRIENDS.

23:25.635 --> 23:28.007
YOU MEAN THE WOMEN WHO INVOLVED
YOU IN A MURDER COVER-UP

23:28.007 --> 23:29.709
AND THEN ABANDONED YOU?

23:29.709 --> 23:31.441
WELL, IN ALL FAIRNESS,
THEY DID ATTEMPT

23:31.441 --> 23:33.543
THAT INTERVENTION
I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

23:33.543 --> 23:37.186
MM-HMM. AND YET THEY HAVEN'T
COME BY SINCE, HAVE THEY?

23:37.186 --> 23:39.188
COME ON.

23:39.188 --> 23:41.120
COME TO THE CABIN.

23:41.120 --> 23:45.054
JUST FOR A FEW WEEKS,
TO SEE IF YOU LIKE IT.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.899
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S DO IT.

23:49.899 --> 23:50.930
WONDERFUL.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.762
I'LL BOOK THE FLIGHT.

23:52.762 --> 23:55.735
HOW'S THE SAUCE?

23:56.836 --> 23:57.937
MMM.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.810
IT'S ALL COMING TOGETHER
PERFECTLY.

24:09.819 --> 24:11.120
(sighs)

24:13.182 --> 24:14.954
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

24:14.954 --> 24:16.956
FOR GIVING ME THE DAY OFF.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.629
I WAS ABLE TO HIT THE ENTIRE
LEFT SIDE OF THE MALL.

24:19.629 --> 24:22.131
AND IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO KEEP TORTURING MY KIDS,

24:22.131 --> 24:23.733
TOMORROW
I'LL HIT THE RIGHT SIDE.

24:23.733 --> 24:25.495
HI, MOM.

24:25.495 --> 24:26.796
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

24:26.796 --> 24:30.239
THE GIRLS AND I TACKLED
THAT DEAD TREE OUT BACK.

24:30.239 --> 24:34.944
I TAUGHT THEM SOME
BASIC FORESTRY PROCEDURE.

24:34.944 --> 24:37.877
THE OLDER ONE IS PRETTY GOOD
WITH AN AX.

24:37.877 --> 24:40.880
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP AN EYE
ON THAT.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.112
(chuckles) WELL,
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

24:43.112 --> 24:46.015
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY WELCOME
TO STAY HERE...

24:46.015 --> 24:48.087
FOR THE NEXT 16 DAYS.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.920
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M GONNA MAKE IT THAT LONG.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.023
I'M THINKING ABOUT BEGGING KAREN
TO TAKE ME BACK.

24:54.023 --> 24:54.924
WHAT?

24:54.924 --> 24:57.026
I REALLY MISS HER.

24:57.026 --> 24:59.729
NO, YOU DON'T.

24:59.729 --> 25:02.131
I MEAN, WHAT'S THERE TO MISS?

25:02.131 --> 25:04.634
YOU KNOW, THE FOUL MOODS
AND THE NAGGING

25:04.634 --> 25:06.205
AND THE...
(speaks gibberish and chuckles)

25:06.205 --> 25:09.278
YEAH,
SHE CAN BE A LITTLE GRUFF.

25:09.278 --> 25:11.981
AND GOD KNOWS
I GOT MY OWN BAGGAGE.

25:11.981 --> 25:15.284
BUT TODAY, WHEN I WAS
TELLING THE GIRLS

25:15.284 --> 25:18.087
WE COULD HAVE A COZY FIRE
TONIGHT,

25:18.087 --> 25:22.552
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS
HAVING ONE WITH KAREN.

25:22.552 --> 25:24.253
(sighs)

25:24.253 --> 25:26.896
WELL... I...

25:26.896 --> 25:29.058
UH,

25:29.058 --> 25:32.131
I... THINK YOU JUST NEED
TO GET YOUR MIND OFF HER.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.764
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HELP?
A NICE, LONG BATH.

25:34.764 --> 25:36.165
YEAH. COME ON. COME ON.

25:36.165 --> 25:38.568
YOU CAN, UH, USE
MY LAVENDER BATH SALTS.

25:38.568 --> 25:39.939
OH, I DO LIKE LAVENDER.

25:39.939 --> 25:42.612
THAT REMINDS ME
OF A FUNNY STORY.

25:42.612 --> 25:43.913
(laughs) HILARIOUS.

25:43.913 --> 25:46.916
OKAY, INTO THE BATH.
CHOP CHOP.

25:50.750 --> 25:54.153
KAREN! IS THAT FOR ME?
HOW THOUGHTFUL.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.956
NO, IT'S FOR ROY,
KIND OF A PEACE OFFERING.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.889
NO. I MEAN, DON'T BACK DOWN.

25:59.889 --> 26:01.991
I'VE ONLY LIVED WITH THE GUY
FOR ONE DAY,

26:01.991 --> 26:03.562
AND I CAN TELL
HE'S A HANDFUL.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.736
WELL, THE TRUTH IS,
I'M THE HANDFUL,

26:06.736 --> 26:08.598
AND I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO HIM.

26:08.598 --> 26:10.299
I HAVE TO CLEAR THE AIR
ABOUT A FEW THINGS.

26:10.299 --> 26:13.102
MM. UH, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA WORK.

26:13.102 --> 26:15.044
WHY NOT? IS HE STILL ANGRY?

26:15.044 --> 26:16.706
LIVID.

26:16.706 --> 26:20.079
YEAH, HE TOOK AN AX TO A TREE
IN MY BACKYARD.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.612
HE JUST KEPT HACKING AT IT

26:22.612 --> 26:26.585
AND MUTTERING "TAKE THAT,
KAREN!" UNDER HIS BREATH.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.017
REALLY?

26:28.017 --> 26:30.359
YEAH, YOU SHOULD GO AND LOOK.
NOTHING LEFT BUT A STUMP.

26:30.359 --> 26:31.691
OH.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.623
OKAY.

26:35.024 --> 26:37.967
YOU KNOW WHAT? DON'T WORRY.
YOU LET ME WORK ON HIM.

26:37.967 --> 26:40.129
I BET YOU
HE'LL COME AROUND IN,

26:40.129 --> 26:42.601
I DON'T KNOW, 16 DAYS.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.373
WELL, CAN YOU GIVE THIS
TO HIM ANYHOW?

26:44.373 --> 26:46.375
IT'S FRENCH APPLE.
IT'S HIS FAVORITE.

26:46.375 --> 26:48.808
I WILL MAKE SURE HE GETS IT.

26:48.808 --> 26:51.040
YEAH.

26:55.084 --> 26:57.086
(sighs) MAKE THIS DISAPPEAR.

26:59.048 --> 27:01.721
IF YOU INSIST.

27:08.157 --> 27:09.258
HEY.

27:09.258 --> 27:11.200
HEY.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.002
YOU OKAY?

27:13.002 --> 27:16.005
THEY SAY THEY WANT TO RUN
MORE TESTS, BUT I'M FINE.

27:16.005 --> 27:18.007
WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE CRAP.

27:18.007 --> 27:21.110
THANKS. SO OTHER THAN
BOOSTING MY SPIRITS,

27:21.110 --> 27:23.112
UH, WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR?

27:23.112 --> 27:27.076
MIKE TOLD ME YOU BORROWED MONEY
FROM A LOAN SHARK.

27:27.076 --> 27:28.647
MIKE SHOULD LEARN
TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.950
LOOK, I DON'T WANT YOU
READING ANYTHING INTO THIS.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.922
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU DEAD,

27:32.922 --> 27:35.324
FROM THAT GUY OR STRESS.

27:35.324 --> 27:37.156
SO HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED?

27:37.156 --> 27:39.889
FROM YOU? NOT A CENT.

27:39.889 --> 27:41.691
BEN, DON'T BE STUPID.

27:41.691 --> 27:43.933
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.
I CAN HELP YOU.

27:43.933 --> 27:46.696
YOU WANT TO HELP ME?

27:46.696 --> 27:49.398
WAIT TILL I GET MYSELF
OUT OF THIS MESS,

27:49.398 --> 27:51.240
THEN LET ME COME BACK TO YOU

27:51.240 --> 27:53.172
AND APOLOGIZE TO YOU
FOR WHAT I DID,

27:53.172 --> 27:58.407
THEN ALLOW ME
TO PROPOSE TO YOU AGAIN...

27:58.407 --> 28:01.110
THIS TIME AS THE KIND OF MAN
YOU DESERVE.

28:01.110 --> 28:03.212
WOW.

28:03.212 --> 28:06.085
I MEAN IT.
I'M STILL CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.316
THAT'S TERRIFIC.

28:07.316 --> 28:09.959
BUT IF YOU DON'T PAY THOSE THUGS
WHAT YOU OWE THEM,

28:09.959 --> 28:12.361
THEY'RE GONNA
DISASSEMBLE YOU.

28:12.361 --> 28:14.093
AND IF WE'RE GETTING
BACK TOGETHER,

28:14.093 --> 28:17.126
I WANT THE WHOLE PACKAGE,

28:17.126 --> 28:19.068
NOT JUST PARTS.

28:19.068 --> 28:22.071
WELL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

28:22.071 --> 28:23.903
YEAH.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.404
YOU'RE DOING
A HELL OF A JOB.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.341
MMM!

28:32.341 --> 28:35.014
IS THERE A BETTER WAY
TO WAKE UP FROM A NAP

28:35.014 --> 28:37.917
THEN TO THE SMELL
OF FRESH-BAKED CROISSANTS?

28:37.917 --> 28:39.118
MMM!

28:39.118 --> 28:42.351
THE QUESTION IS RHETORICAL,
BUT THE ANSWER IS STILL NO.

28:42.351 --> 28:44.123
AH! (hisses)

28:44.123 --> 28:46.756
I'VE LEFT SOME FOR YOU.

28:46.756 --> 28:48.197
THESE ARE FOR THE GIRLS.

28:48.197 --> 28:50.059
THE GIRLS?

28:50.059 --> 28:52.802
YES. I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME THINKING,

28:52.802 --> 28:55.935
AND IT'S TIME
FOR RECONCILIATION.

28:55.935 --> 28:59.138
WHAT A GOOD HEART YOU HAVE,

28:59.138 --> 29:00.770
MY DEAR.

29:00.770 --> 29:02.171
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE
A GOOD HEAD,

29:02.171 --> 29:04.313
AND MAYBE YOU SHOULD GIVE THIS
A SECOND THOUGHT.

29:04.313 --> 29:06.315
NO, I'VE GIVEN IT
A LOT OF THOUGHT,

29:06.315 --> 29:09.148
AND THERE'S BLAME ENOUGH FOR
ALL FOUR OF US IN WHAT HAPPENED.

29:09.148 --> 29:12.922
BESIDES, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
THEY ACTUALLY HELPED SAVE ME.

29:12.922 --> 29:14.123
HOW?

29:14.123 --> 29:15.754
BY CALLING YOU.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.756
YOU TOLD ME SO YOURSELF
THAT NIGHT OUTSIDE THE BAR.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.259
AND IF THEY HADN'T, WHO KNOWS
WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO ME?

29:20.259 --> 29:23.833
WELL, I-I SUPPOSE ONE COULD
 MAKE THAT ARGUMENT, BUT--

29:23.833 --> 29:25.895
BUT NOTHING.
I AM GONNA THANK THEM

29:25.895 --> 29:27.937
FOR BRINGING YOU BACK
INTO MY LIFE

29:27.937 --> 29:29.839
AND TELL THEM
ABOUT OUR TRIP TOGETHER.

29:29.839 --> 29:31.540
AND BESIDES,

29:31.540 --> 29:35.144
IT'S TIME ONE OF US
MADE THE FIRST MOVE.

29:35.144 --> 29:37.977
THEY ALREADY DID.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.308
I'M SORRY?

29:39.308 --> 29:44.283
THEY CAME BY THE OTHER DAY WHEN
I WAS OUTSIDE CHECKING THE RAMP.

29:44.283 --> 29:49.088
I DIDN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE...
IT WAS AN UNKIND VISIT.

29:49.088 --> 29:51.390
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

29:51.390 --> 29:53.092
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT
THEY WERE HERE

29:53.092 --> 29:55.164
TO APOLOGIZE
FOR HOW THEY TREATED YOU.

29:55.164 --> 29:57.897
BUT THEN
THE COMMENTS STARTED--

29:57.897 --> 30:00.569
HOW YOU "DESERVE"
WHAT HAPPENED

30:00.569 --> 30:02.171
AND HOW THEY REGRET
CALLING ME

30:02.171 --> 30:04.834
BECAUSE NOW I WAS "STUCK"
WITH YOU.

30:04.834 --> 30:08.177
THEY SAID THOSE THINGS?

30:08.177 --> 30:10.209
AND MORE.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.111
WORSE.

30:16.986 --> 30:19.288
I SWORE I WASN'T
GONNA TELL YOU, BREE,

30:19.288 --> 30:21.851
BUT I COULDN'T LET YOU
HUMILIATE YOURSELF

30:21.851 --> 30:26.255
BY EXTENDING KINDNESS
TO PEOPLE SO UNDESERVING OF IT.

30:29.358 --> 30:31.200
NO, I'M GLAD
YOU DIDN'T HIDE IT FROM ME.

30:36.365 --> 30:39.208
YOU'RE ALWAYS TRYING
TO PROTECT ME, AREN'T YOU?

30:43.212 --> 30:46.375
LYNETTE, OH, I'M SO GLAD
YOU COULD COME OVER.

30:46.375 --> 30:48.277
OH, YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO TALK.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:48.277 --> 30:49.949
COME SIT DOWN.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.921
PUT YOUR FEET UP.

30:51.921 --> 30:53.522
HAVE A COOKIE.

30:53.522 --> 30:55.484
(chuckles) OKAY.

30:55.484 --> 30:56.886
AH.

30:56.886 --> 30:59.588
(clicks tongue)
LOOK AT US,

30:59.588 --> 31:02.561
BEINGS FRIENDS...
(chuckles)

31:02.561 --> 31:04.363
EATING COOKIES.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.996
OH.

31:06.996 --> 31:11.100
CAN YOU IMAGINE US BEING EVEN
CLOSER THAN WE ARE RIGHT NOW?

31:11.100 --> 31:13.402
UM...

31:13.402 --> 31:15.274
I THINK WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE
ALREADY.

31:15.274 --> 31:16.976
I'M JUST SAYING,

31:16.976 --> 31:20.009
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT
IF WE WERE FAMILY?

31:20.009 --> 31:22.351
OKAY, SUSAN, IF YOU NEED
A RIDE TO THE AIRPORT--

31:22.351 --> 31:24.113
NO, NOT THAT.

31:24.113 --> 31:28.187
I JUST WANT TO SHARE
SOME AMAZING NEWS...

31:29.318 --> 31:31.590
ABOUT OUR CHILDREN.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.422
NO!

31:33.422 --> 31:35.664
NO! NO! NO!
HE CAN'T BE HAVING A BABY!

31:35.664 --> 31:37.366
HERE!
HONEY, BREATHE INTO THIS!

31:37.366 --> 31:40.169
OH! (hyperventilating)

31:40.169 --> 31:42.471
OKAY. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

31:42.471 --> 31:45.034
JULIE'S GONNA GIVE THE BABY UP
FOR ADOPTION.

31:45.034 --> 31:46.936
I DON'T KNOW
WHY PEOPLE DO THIS.

31:46.936 --> 31:49.308
UH, ACTUALLY,
IN A VERY MATURE MOVE,

31:49.308 --> 31:51.610
PORTER SAYS HE WANTS
TO KEEP THE BABY.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.312
WHAT?

31:53.312 --> 31:56.185
YEAH. HE WANTS
TO RAISE IT HIMSELF.

31:56.185 --> 31:58.417
HE CAN'T RAISE A BABY!

31:58.417 --> 32:00.219
HE CAN'T EVEN TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF.

32:00.219 --> 32:02.351
ALL HE EATS ARE FROZEN WAFFLES--
STILL FROZEN!

32:02.351 --> 32:04.553
OKAY, YOU JUST NEED
TO CALM DOWN.

32:04.553 --> 32:07.156
NO, WHAT I NEED IS--IS
A TIME MACHINE TO GO BACK THERE

32:07.156 --> 32:09.158
SO I CAN SLAP SOME SENSE
INTO THAT IDIOT.

32:09.158 --> 32:11.430
IN FACT, I'M GONNA DO
THE SLAPPING PART RIGHT NOW.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.463
NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU--
YOU CAN'T BE MAD AT PORTER.

32:14.463 --> 32:16.035
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD'VE HEARD
THE WAY

32:16.035 --> 32:19.238
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE BABY.
HE'S SO EXCITED.

32:19.238 --> 32:21.370
YEAH, AND HE'LL STAY EXCITED
FOR ABOUT A WEEK,

32:21.370 --> 32:23.672
JUST LIKE HE DID WITH THE PUPPY
WE GAVE HIM IN FIFTH GRADE.

32:23.672 --> 32:25.714
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT PUPPY?
 NO.

32:25.714 --> 32:28.717
NO ONE DOES. AND--AND WHAT
WAS JULIE THINKING?

32:28.717 --> 32:32.151
JULIE?
 YEAH, SHE SHOULD HAVE SOME
SENSE. SHE'S GETTING A PhD.

32:32.151 --> 32:34.323
MY KID EATS WAFFSICLES.

32:34.323 --> 32:36.385
YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT HERE.

32:36.385 --> 32:37.586
YOUR SON...
 YEAH.

32:37.586 --> 32:41.060
AND MY DAUGHTER--THEY MADE
THIS SWEET LITTLE BABY TOGETHER,

32:41.060 --> 32:42.992
AND WE COULD HELP RAISE IT.

32:42.992 --> 32:48.437
OH. I... I ALREADY HAVE
A SWEET LITTLE BABY,

32:48.437 --> 32:50.399
WHO IS ONLY MONTHS AWAY
FROM DAY CARE.

32:50.399 --> 32:53.302
I AM NOT GOING RIGHT BACK
TO THE BEGINNING.

32:53.302 --> 32:55.004
I SEE.

32:55.004 --> 32:59.348
YOU'RE AFRAID
OF BEING INCONVENIENCED,

32:59.348 --> 33:02.511
SO YOU WANT TO GIVE THE BABY
AWAY TO STRANGERS.

33:02.511 --> 33:05.454
NO.

33:05.454 --> 33:07.086
I WANT TO GIVE THAT BABY AWAY

33:07.086 --> 33:08.757
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE READY
TO BE PARENTS.

33:08.757 --> 33:10.619
IT'S BETTER FOR PORTER,
IT'S BETTER FOR JULIE,

33:10.619 --> 33:13.162
AND IT'S SURE AS HELL BETTER
FOR THAT BABY.

33:28.337 --> 33:30.239
HEY!
 LOOK AT WHAT I'M DOING.

33:30.239 --> 33:33.242
PAY ATTENTION TO ME.
TELL ME I'M GREAT.
 WHAT IS HAPPENING?

33:33.242 --> 33:35.614
I'M THIRSTY.
I WANT A GLASS OF WATER NOW!

33:35.614 --> 33:37.386
WATER! WATER! WATER!

33:37.386 --> 33:39.218
OH. YOU'RE A BABY.
I GET IT.

33:39.218 --> 33:42.121
NO, PORTER,
YOU DON'T GET IT.

33:42.121 --> 33:45.454
WHEN THIS BABY COMES, IT'S GONNA
WANT FOOD AND CLOTHES

33:45.454 --> 33:47.256
AND A HOME TO LIVE IN,

33:47.256 --> 33:49.458
BECAUSE BABIES ARE SELFISH
THAT WAY.

33:49.458 --> 33:51.160
I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.461
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

33:52.461 --> 33:54.403
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO COMMIT TO ANYTHING.

33:54.403 --> 33:56.305
MAYBE IF JULIE WAS
GIVING BIRTH TO A VIDEO GAME

33:56.305 --> 33:57.806
OR A NEW PORN SITE,

33:57.806 --> 34:01.210
BUT THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL
YOU ARE READY FOR THIS!

34:01.210 --> 34:02.311
CAN I TALK NOW?
 YES, GO AHEAD,
BUT IF I HAPPEN

34:02.311 --> 34:05.344
TO ROLL MY EYES AND SNORT,
JUST KNOW I WAS PROVOKED.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.146
EVERYTHING YOU SAID IS TRUE.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.178
I-I'M NOT READY FOR THIS.

34:09.178 --> 34:11.480
I HAVE $17
IN MY CHECKING ACCOUNT

34:11.480 --> 34:14.183
AND NO CLUE
HOW TO WRITE A RESUME.

34:14.183 --> 34:15.754
YEAH, A COUPLE DAYS AGO,
THAT DIDN'T BOTHER ME,

34:15.754 --> 34:17.156
BUT NOW IT'S ALL
I CAN THINK ABOUT.

34:17.156 --> 34:19.228
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO MORE THAN THINK.

34:19.228 --> 34:21.530
I WILL. I'LL GET A JOB.
I'LL TAKE--I'LL TAKE CLASSES.

34:21.530 --> 34:23.262
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.065
OKAY.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.297
OKAY, THAT'S GREAT, BUT...

34:33.302 --> 34:35.603
WHEN YOU ARE A PARENT,

34:35.603 --> 34:38.547
THERE IS SO MUCH YOU ARE
GONNA HAVE TO GIVE UP.

34:38.547 --> 34:41.810
YOUR WHOLE LIFE JUST...

34:43.581 --> 34:47.286
IT IS GONNA CHANGE FOREVER.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.087
IT ALREADY HAS.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.590
SHE'S NOT EVEN BORN YET,
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE

34:51.590 --> 34:55.324
HOW MUCH I'M DYING TO...
SEE HER.

34:55.324 --> 34:57.226
MOM...

34:57.226 --> 35:00.129
I LOVE HER.

35:00.129 --> 35:03.872
I REALLY, REALLY LOVE HER.

35:13.382 --> 35:15.784
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.
PORTER HIRED A LAWYER.

35:15.784 --> 35:17.186
HE WANTS TO RAISE THE BABY.

35:17.186 --> 35:19.518
HEY, IS THAT
SUCH A TERRIBLE THING?

35:19.518 --> 35:23.222
I MEAN, HE'S NOT GONNA BE
DOING IT ON HIS OWN. I'LL HELP.

35:23.222 --> 35:24.753
YOU THINK
THAT MAKES IT BETTER?

35:24.753 --> 35:27.796
NOW WHEN I COME HOME,
I'LL HAVE TO SEE HER.

35:27.796 --> 35:31.530
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW PAINFUL THAT'S GONNA BE?

35:31.530 --> 35:34.132
I JUST...

35:34.132 --> 35:37.306
WANT TO FORGET
THIS EVER HAPPENED.

35:37.306 --> 35:40.339
JULIE, IT'S YOUR DAUGHTER.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.511
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA FORGET.

35:42.511 --> 35:45.214
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

35:45.214 --> 35:47.145
YES, I DO,

35:47.145 --> 35:49.478
BECAUSE I'VE HAD A DAUGHTER.

35:49.478 --> 35:53.782
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND
THIS UNTIL YOU HAVE ONE, TOO,

35:53.782 --> 35:57.686
BUT EVERY SINGLE DAY
THAT YOU'RE NOT WITH ME,

35:57.686 --> 36:00.789
I THINK ABOUT YOU.

36:00.789 --> 36:03.392
I WONDER WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

36:03.392 --> 36:06.295
I WORRY IF YOU'RE SAFE,

36:06.295 --> 36:09.638
AND I HOPE YOU ARE HAPPY.

36:12.371 --> 36:13.702
NO!

36:15.244 --> 36:17.746
THIS WAS MY DECISION TO MAKE,

36:17.746 --> 36:19.578
AND YOU TOOK IT AWAY.

36:21.250 --> 36:24.753
I CAN'T FORGIVE YOU FOR THAT.

36:31.890 --> 36:35.424
OH, THERE YOU ARE. I CAN'T
GET CELIA TO TAKE A BATH.

36:35.424 --> 36:37.396
DO YOU STILL HAVE
THAT DUMMY GRENADE?

36:37.396 --> 36:39.628
(sighs)

36:39.628 --> 36:43.332
YOU OKAY?

36:43.332 --> 36:47.306
I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
GONNA END LIKE THIS.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.808
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

36:49.808 --> 36:52.811
I THOUGHT I'D FINALLY
FOUND THE ONE.

36:52.811 --> 36:55.984
OH, IT'S JUST A ROUGH PATCH.

36:55.984 --> 36:58.447
YOU TWO WILL COME OUT OF THIS
STRONGER THAN EVER.

36:58.447 --> 37:00.218
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.651
AT MY AGE, FALLING IN LOVE

37:02.651 --> 37:07.396
IS NOT ABOUT ALL THAT DRAMA
YOU YOUNG PEOPLE GO THROUGH.

37:07.396 --> 37:11.500
IT'S ABOUT FINDING THE ONE
WHO'LL BE THERE,

37:11.500 --> 37:15.634
HOLDING YOUR HANDS,
AT THE END.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.436
I THOUGHT...

37:17.436 --> 37:21.570
KAREN WOULD BE THAT PERSON
FOR ME.

37:21.570 --> 37:24.313
BUT I-I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

37:36.985 --> 37:41.259
SO WE GOT YOUR M.R.I. BACK,

37:41.259 --> 37:45.534
AND I'M AFRAID THE RESULTS
ARE NOT WHAT WE'D HOPED FOR.

37:45.534 --> 37:47.736
THE CANCER IS BACK.

37:47.736 --> 37:50.969
IT'S METASTASIZED
TO THE BRAIN.

37:54.373 --> 37:57.476
SO THE DRUGS
HAVE STOPPED WORKING, HUH?

37:57.476 --> 37:59.308
I'M AFRAID SO.

37:59.308 --> 38:00.709
BUT WE'LL START YOU

38:00.709 --> 38:03.912
ON AN AGGRESSIVE COURSE
OF RADIATION RIGHT AWAY,

38:03.912 --> 38:06.615
AND THERE ARE NEW THERAPIES
WE CAN TRY.

38:06.615 --> 38:10.018
THANKS FOR GIVING IT TO ME
STRAIGHT.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.492
KAREN...

38:14.723 --> 38:17.396
WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS BEFORE,

38:17.396 --> 38:18.897
AND YOU ARE A FIGHTER,

38:18.897 --> 38:21.430
BUT THIS IS GONNA BE TOUGH.

38:21.430 --> 38:24.333
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM ROY.

38:26.375 --> 38:29.578
ACTUALLY, UH,
ROY'S OUT OF THE PICTURE.

38:29.578 --> 38:31.510
HE AND I SPLIT.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.041
OH, I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

38:33.041 --> 38:35.644
I'M NOT.

38:35.644 --> 38:38.647
HE HAD TO WATCH HIS FIRST WIFE
GET SICK AND DIE.

38:38.647 --> 38:40.649
HE DOESN'T NEED
TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

38:42.551 --> 38:45.494
TRUST ME.

38:47.596 --> 38:50.359
(sighs)
THIS IS FOR THE BEST.

39:03.612 --> 39:05.113
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

39:05.113 --> 39:06.815
I'D LIKE TO JUST PAY
THE ENTIRE BILL TODAY

39:06.815 --> 39:09.448
AND CLOSE OUT THIS ACCOUNT.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.582
AND, UH, I ASSUME
YOU'LL HONOR OUR AGREEMENT

39:13.582 --> 39:16.525
TO KEEP THIS
JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

39:16.525 --> 39:18.427
YEAH, SURE.

39:18.427 --> 39:20.559
YOU HAVE A LOVELY HOME.

39:20.559 --> 39:23.061
I CAN TELL YOU LIKE
THE FINER THINGS.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.764
YOU WERE MARRIED
TO THAT YANKEE, RIGHT?

39:25.764 --> 39:28.697
I HEARD HE CHEATED ON YOU.

39:28.697 --> 39:32.140
MAN, YOU MUST HAVE CLEANED UP
IN THAT DIVORCE.

39:37.546 --> 39:39.408
IT ALWAYS AMAZES ME
HOW MUCH POWER

39:39.408 --> 39:40.879
IS IN THIS LITTLE PIECE
OF PAPER.

39:40.879 --> 39:44.483
I MEAN, WITH IT,
ALL YOUR PROBLEMS DISAPPEAR.

39:44.483 --> 39:46.555
WITHOUT IT,

39:46.555 --> 39:49.758
YOUR AUSSIE FRIEND...

39:49.758 --> 39:51.389
HE ENDS UP BEGGING
ONE OF MY GUYS

39:51.389 --> 39:53.462
NOT TO SHOOT HIM
IN THE KNEECAP.

39:55.524 --> 39:59.127
UH, YOU... HAVE YOUR MONEY.

39:59.127 --> 40:00.599
ARE WE DONE?

40:00.599 --> 40:02.100
SURE, WE'RE DONE.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.702
NORMALLY,
I'D NEVER TAKE A CHECK,

40:03.702 --> 40:07.706
BUT YOU SEEM LIKE
A CLASSY LADY,

40:07.706 --> 40:10.609
AND I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.

40:16.485 --> 40:20.519
I REMEMBER THIS.

40:20.519 --> 40:22.691
I BOUGHT IT FOR YOU
IN MILAN.

40:22.691 --> 40:24.893
CASHMERE.

40:24.893 --> 40:26.555
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

40:26.555 --> 40:30.829
HUH. MUCH TOO FUSSY
FOR WHERE WE'RE GOING.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.030
YOU WANT TO STICK

40:32.030 --> 40:37.035
WITH MORE COMFORTABLE,
CASUAL THINGS, BREE.

40:37.035 --> 40:38.507
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

40:38.507 --> 40:41.209
YES. IT'S JUST
THAT I DON'T THINK

40:41.209 --> 40:43.812
I'VE EVER SEEN YOU
THIS CONFIDENT.

40:43.812 --> 40:45.544
(chuckles)

40:45.544 --> 40:48.877
WELL, I'M NOT THE SAME MAN
I WAS TWO YEARS AGO.

40:48.877 --> 40:50.979
I'VE LET GO OF A LOT,

40:50.979 --> 40:52.681
CHANGED MY LIFE COMPLETELY.

40:52.681 --> 40:54.583
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

40:54.583 --> 40:57.956
WELL, IT STARTED WHEN I LEARNED
TO DRIVE AGAIN.

40:57.956 --> 40:58.987
REALLY?

40:58.987 --> 41:00.929
MM. I KNOW IT SOUNDS STRANGE,

41:00.929 --> 41:06.635
BUT FOR ME, IN MY CONDITION,
THAT FREEDOM CHANGED EVERYTHING.

41:10.599 --> 41:11.870
(Orson) DRIVING WAS A WAY

41:11.870 --> 41:14.543
FOR ME TO MOVE FORWARD
WITH MY LIFE,

41:14.543 --> 41:17.846
TO LET GO OF THE PAST.

41:21.079 --> 41:25.584
BEING ON THE ROAD
GAVE ME A NEW PERSPECTIVE.

41:28.587 --> 41:30.519
I STARTED TO SEE
THE SILVER LINING

41:30.519 --> 41:33.862
IN EVEN THE WORST SITUATIONS.

41:36.725 --> 41:39.568
I LEARNED TO BE CALMER,

41:39.568 --> 41:41.530
MORE PATIENT.

41:42.971 --> 41:46.735
I EVEN BEGAN
SPENDING MORE TIME IN NATURE.

41:50.909 --> 41:54.182
AND I STARTED REACHING OUT
TO OLD FRIENDS.

42:00.188 --> 42:02.520
IT TOOK TIME,

42:02.520 --> 42:05.523
BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE,
I BECAME A NEW MAN.

42:05.523 --> 42:09.728
WHAT AN INSPIRING STORY.
(chuckles)

42:09.728 --> 42:11.600
PERHAPS WHEN WE'RE IN MAINE,

42:11.600 --> 42:15.163
YOU CAN HELP ME START
THE PROCESS OF CHANGING MY LIFE.

42:15.163 --> 42:17.606
OH, BREE, DON'T YOU SEE?

42:17.606 --> 42:20.639
THE PROCESS HAS
ALREADY STARTED FOR YOU.

42:22.310 --> 42:24.643
I SUPPOSE IT HAS.

42:24.643 --> 42:26.775
TRUST ME, DARLING.

42:26.775 --> 42:28.777
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
WHERE IT'S GOING TO END UP.
