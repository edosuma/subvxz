00:05.245 --> 00:07.080
<i>~ Previously
on "Green Lantern"... ~</i>

00:07.138 --> 00:10.419
<i>For what possible reason
would Aya want to time travel?</i>

00:10.496 --> 00:15.261
<i>- To remake the Universe.
- There is no hope for her.</i>

00:15.293 --> 00:17.324
Our only choice...

00:17.337 --> 00:19.203
Is to destroy her.

00:21.163 --> 00:23.561
Green Lanterns,
these will very likely

00:23.589 --> 00:26.258
be the final orders
I shall ever give to you.

00:26.288 --> 00:29.240
<i>The Aya entity, now bonded
with the Anti-Monitor,</i>

00:29.265 --> 00:31.367
<i>is in orbit above Maltus.</i>

00:31.474 --> 00:36.150
<i>It plans to return to the very moment
of creation, to remake reality.</i>

00:36.178 --> 00:39.247
<i>Everything you have ever known
will never have existed.</i>

00:39.355 --> 00:42.485
A new Universe
she creates will be...

00:42.993 --> 00:45.831
Will be devoid
of organic life.

00:45.899 --> 00:47.802
<i>I will not belie our chances.</i>

00:47.870 --> 00:51.206
<i>Aya has absorbed the energy
of dozens of star systems.</i>

00:51.274 --> 00:55.512
The Green Lanterns' power,
as great as it is, is no match for her.

00:56.083 --> 00:59.986
Still, we shall fight
to our last breath.

01:00.054 --> 01:05.291
We, the Guardians of Oa,
wish you luck,

01:05.358 --> 01:08.229
<i>our Green Lantern Corps.</i>

01:22.247 --> 01:24.014
Display star chart.

01:24.082 --> 01:26.917
Highlight systems destroyed
by the Aya entity.

01:26.985 --> 01:29.754
Which I unleashed
on the Universe.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.634
This is not your fault,
Hal Jordan.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.870
In cultivating
Aya's independence,

01:42.907 --> 01:44.951
you could not know
what havoc she would wreak.

01:45.007 --> 01:46.477
Couldn't I, Tomar-Re?

01:46.501 --> 01:48.234
I stole the ship
she was trapped in,

01:48.282 --> 01:51.381
broke her out of Scar's lab
without giving it a moment's thought.

01:51.448 --> 01:55.452
And now I either destroy my friend
or we lose everything.

01:55.766 --> 01:57.633
Like these people did.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.481
An interesting coincidence.

02:00.524 --> 02:03.392
That is my sector... 2813.

02:03.460 --> 02:06.944
So this is personal for you.
You're anxious for some payback.

02:07.120 --> 02:10.322
This particular system
was devoid of life.

02:10.389 --> 02:13.108
<i>A fortunate stroke of luck.</i>

02:14.427 --> 02:19.799
Revenge will not cloud my actions,
but deployment begins.

02:19.867 --> 02:21.335
We must join the others.

02:21.481 --> 02:23.210
You know what?
You go ahead.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.515
There's something
I need to check.

02:37.922 --> 02:40.190
Display secondary star chart.

02:40.258 --> 02:42.960
Highlight all
uninhabited systems.

02:44.528 --> 02:47.902
Overlay map with sectors
destroyed by Aya.

03:32.216 --> 03:34.817
My task is nearly complete.

03:34.885 --> 03:37.620
Hold them off a short while,
my children.

04:27.543 --> 04:30.345
Too many of them!
No way we're bustin' through.

04:30.413 --> 04:33.284
Aw, the little robots
are to tough for the sergeant?

04:33.308 --> 04:35.088
You want I should send
one of the guys out

04:35.119 --> 04:37.675
for a smaller, weaker
universe-threatening entity?

04:37.739 --> 04:42.195
Why, you puffed up little hatchling,
I'll show you who's tough!

04:51.953 --> 04:55.094
All divisions be alert
to Manhunter reinforcements

04:55.118 --> 04:57.519
approaching sector 22 mark 8.

04:57.571 --> 05:01.674
Salaak, I know this sounds crazy, but
you've got to call off this attack.

05:01.813 --> 05:04.548
The time displacement
generator is coming online.

05:04.616 --> 05:08.505
All life past and present is now
within moments of nonexistence.

05:08.544 --> 05:11.731
- Salaak, listen!
- Hal Jordan of Earth, no.

05:19.531 --> 05:21.924
- Jordan?
- Cover him!

05:41.020 --> 05:44.155
Aya, listen to me!
You are not what you claim!

05:44.207 --> 05:47.902
I know about the systems you destroyed.
I know your secret.

05:48.993 --> 05:51.628
If living organisms have no meaning
or value to you,

05:51.696 --> 05:55.366
then why feed only on stars
surrounded by lifeless planets?

05:55.556 --> 05:57.491
<i>I scanned the systems
you decimated.</i>

05:57.559 --> 05:59.853
<i>Every single one of them
was uninhabited.</i>

05:59.901 --> 06:02.535
You couldn't do it, could you,
vaporize living beings,

06:02.577 --> 06:05.501
<i>because you're not a killer.</i>

06:07.568 --> 06:10.236
What you believe about me
is irrelevant.

06:10.304 --> 06:12.481
But you were instrumental
in my escape

06:12.515 --> 06:15.098
from the computer prison
the Guardians doomed me to.

06:15.148 --> 06:17.703
And for that,
I give you a gift.

06:17.745 --> 06:21.015
You will bear witness
to all creation being remade.

06:21.082 --> 06:26.853
<i>Before you die, you shall be the last
living organism in all existence.</i>

06:50.640 --> 06:52.941
Where...

06:54.616 --> 06:56.964
Oh, wow.

07:02.986 --> 07:05.621
The window
to the door of time.

07:11.496 --> 07:14.380
Hal Jordan to Corps. Come in.
Do you copy?

07:14.431 --> 07:18.021
<i>- Kilowog, Guy, anybody.</i>
- Hal, you ok?

07:18.078 --> 07:19.579
Forget targeting
the Anti-Monitor.

07:19.602 --> 07:21.681
We'll never defeat
this thing with firepower.

07:21.748 --> 07:24.417
Send in Razer.
Top priority. Copy.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.000
<i>Send in Razer!</i>

07:26.047 --> 07:29.189
- But how are we supposed to...
- No time. Just do it!

07:29.889 --> 07:32.325
That's easy for me to say.

07:38.437 --> 07:41.205
What is this, bingo night
at the retirement home?

07:41.241 --> 07:43.086
Pour it on!

07:58.029 --> 08:01.522
What now, sergeant? Shoes too tight?
Coffee not hot enough for you?

08:01.565 --> 08:03.933
Shut it, Guy. I just
got a message from Hal.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.526
He wants us to send him
Razer, asap!

08:06.563 --> 08:08.894
Hal, your friend
that was just eaten,

08:08.933 --> 08:11.237
wants me to ignore orders,
stop what we're doing

08:11.265 --> 08:14.601
and try to get Red Pajamas here
inside the giant robot corpse?

08:14.629 --> 08:16.328
Uh-huh, I'll get right on that.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.278
I know, it sounds nuts.
Hal's plans usually do.

08:19.325 --> 08:21.541
But the crazy thing is
they sometimes even work.

08:21.609 --> 08:25.223
Raze is the only one here with a Power
Ring that works on green constructs.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.130
Aya's practically
made of the stuff.

08:27.182 --> 08:29.744
Maybe Hal figures if we can
get him past the defenses,

08:29.779 --> 08:32.941
<i>he'll be able to shut
her down permanently!</i>

08:37.993 --> 08:41.128
You seldom fail to surprise
me, Green Lantern Hal,

08:41.196 --> 08:43.929
considering the stakes for
your fellow organic beings.

08:43.976 --> 08:47.301
I would have thought you'd
attempt to shoot me in the back.

08:47.369 --> 08:50.805
- Would it have done any good?
- None whatsoever.

08:50.872 --> 08:54.178
You can't do this.
Look around you, Aya.

08:54.225 --> 08:57.464
An eternal endless expanse
completely devoid of life.

08:57.487 --> 08:59.254
Nothing but emptiness forever.

08:59.279 --> 09:01.514
This is your dream
of a perfect universe?

09:01.581 --> 09:05.751
- It's nonexistence.
- No. Only for your kind.

09:05.819 --> 09:08.588
I am not preventing
the big bang, as you call it.

09:08.655 --> 09:10.022
I am improving it,

09:10.052 --> 09:14.020
eliminating a few key elements
required for organic biology.

09:14.071 --> 09:18.441
- The universe <i>will</i> exist.
- But without life.

09:18.508 --> 09:21.911
I will fill the cosmos with
self-replicating artificial beings,

09:21.979 --> 09:24.080
incapable of pain.

09:24.148 --> 09:26.861
A perfect universe.

09:33.494 --> 09:35.628
What if Jordan's wrong?

09:35.696 --> 09:39.255
If he's wrong, neither
of us will ever know.

09:43.503 --> 09:44.801
Ready?

09:44.847 --> 09:47.501
It takes little preparation
to be a living bullet.

09:47.570 --> 09:48.936
Not what I mean.

09:49.004 --> 09:52.807
Kid, understand, I care
about Aya as much as...

09:52.875 --> 09:59.647
- You know what you gotta do, right?
- I will do what must be done.

09:59.714 --> 10:02.717
Yawn. What are you
waiting for?

10:24.571 --> 10:25.976
Fire!

10:42.255 --> 10:43.756
Aya, listen to me.

10:43.824 --> 10:46.558
You only converted uninhabited
systems into energy.

10:46.626 --> 10:49.328
Your empathy stopped you
from destroying life.

10:49.396 --> 10:52.942
I have neither empathy
nor enmity for organic life.

10:53.005 --> 10:57.895
By preventing life from ever developing,
I can stop suffering from ever occurring.

10:57.942 --> 11:01.039
You'll also stop joy
and happiness and love.

11:01.107 --> 11:05.544
A characteristically emotional
outburst from an organic life form.

11:06.053 --> 11:08.736
It's time for
a rude awakening, Aya.

11:09.281 --> 11:13.283
<i>All that was missing
was the spark of life.</i>

11:13.351 --> 11:15.018
<i>Unbeknownst to anyone,</i>

11:15.086 --> 11:19.389
<i>I extracted a portion of the entity
dwelling inside the Central Battery.</i>

11:19.457 --> 11:24.393
<i>I required but a sliver of that being
to complete my experiment,</i>

11:24.461 --> 11:29.279
<i>And, alas, what you
call Aya was born.</i>

11:29.439 --> 11:32.233
Newsflash... you are not
purely artificial.

11:32.301 --> 11:35.070
You were created from
a strand of a living being.

11:35.137 --> 11:37.371
You're alive, Aya.

11:38.997 --> 11:41.798
No. It is faulty information.

11:41.866 --> 11:45.369
You know it's true. I'm not clever
enough to fake that footage.

11:45.436 --> 11:48.005
<i>You're one of us, Aya.</i>

11:59.752 --> 12:03.021
You can't destroy life
without destroying yourself.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.904
That changes nothing.

12:09.952 --> 12:13.145
A universe free of pain
is a desirable objective,

12:13.196 --> 12:16.807
even if it means the end
of my own existence.

12:22.086 --> 12:25.990
Living or not, I am
a being free of emotion,

12:26.058 --> 12:30.255
and make this decision
based solely on cold reason.

12:45.811 --> 12:49.013
A new reality
is about to be born.

12:49.081 --> 12:53.652
Yours will be the last and only
emotion this universe will ever know.

13:02.320 --> 13:05.236
What emotion is it,
Green Lantern Hal?

13:05.608 --> 13:07.899
Regret.

13:11.137 --> 13:13.205
[grunts]

13:13.273 --> 13:14.774
Razer!

13:15.675 --> 13:16.875
[gasps]

13:20.814 --> 13:23.148
What... What have I done?

13:23.215 --> 13:27.181
Is this the emotionless machine mind
that wants to fix the universe?

13:27.228 --> 13:29.477
Your emotions were never
completely sealed off.

13:29.545 --> 13:31.713
They couldn't be, because
you're not a machine.

13:31.780 --> 13:36.403
<i>You're alive. And your decisions
are just as flawed as any of ours.</i>

13:47.364 --> 13:48.731
[groans]

13:48.799 --> 13:51.467
- Aya.
- Yes, my love.

13:51.535 --> 13:54.103
[grunts]

13:56.473 --> 14:00.077
[gasping]

14:00.450 --> 14:02.878
Razer must receive
medical attention.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.209
That would probably be best
done back in our own time.

14:05.281 --> 14:07.449
[rumbling]

14:13.313 --> 14:16.882
If there's a populated future
to get back to, that is.

14:31.959 --> 14:34.470
I have ceased manipulating
the vortex.

14:34.498 --> 14:37.300
The universe will develop
naturally and undisturbed.

14:43.877 --> 14:46.255
We need to go now.

15:16.838 --> 15:20.041
What have I done to him?
What have I done?

15:20.976 --> 15:23.077
Aya, think.
Help him.

15:23.145 --> 15:26.195
I absorbed enough energy
to turn back time itself.

15:26.235 --> 15:29.071
I now use that power
to heal your body.

15:37.374 --> 15:39.965
You will be all right, Razer.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.566
You must be all right.

15:49.172 --> 15:51.131
I will be...

15:51.436 --> 15:54.343
Now that you have
come back to me.

15:54.985 --> 15:57.514
I was a threat
to everything.

15:57.582 --> 15:58.982
To all life.

15:59.050 --> 16:01.885
In that one moment,
you could have struck me down.

16:01.953 --> 16:04.035
Why didn't you?

16:04.465 --> 16:06.607
How could I kill you?

16:06.637 --> 16:09.347
My Red Energy constructs
are powered by hate

16:09.396 --> 16:12.732
and there is no hate
in my heart for you, Aya,

16:13.169 --> 16:15.404
only love.

16:23.073 --> 16:26.740
<i>Jordan, come in. Are you all right?
What's going on in there?</i>

16:26.780 --> 16:30.283
It's over. We did it.
Aya's back on our side.

16:30.319 --> 16:33.065
<i>- It's gonna be ok.</i>
- That's real good news, Jordan,

16:33.094 --> 16:35.262
About your robot
turning good and everything.

16:35.315 --> 16:38.517
<i>Too bad she still has an army
of Manhunters attacking us.</i>

16:38.726 --> 16:41.561
Aya, stop them.
Call off the Manhunters.

16:41.629 --> 16:43.530
I have tried,
Green Lantern Hal.

16:43.551 --> 16:46.161
The other A.I.'s no longer
recognize me as one of them.

16:46.196 --> 16:48.431
They will not obey
my commands.

16:48.803 --> 16:52.696
In my madness, I uploaded a copy
of my program into the Manhunters.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.298
<i>Now each of them is
a newly minted copy of me</i>

16:55.365 --> 16:58.267
<i>and a potential threat
to the universe.</i>

16:58.335 --> 17:02.156
You only became a threat
because of my treatment of you.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.788
Surely these copies are...

17:03.813 --> 17:06.098
Negative. It is
a statistical probability

17:06.165 --> 17:08.434
that eventually, any one of them
will ultimately

17:08.462 --> 17:11.108
find a way to end life
in the universe.

17:11.133 --> 17:13.914
Then we'll just have to find every
single one of them and make sure that...

17:13.941 --> 17:17.842
There is no time. However,
I have an immediate solution.

17:19.012 --> 17:20.945
A computer virus.

17:21.013 --> 17:23.080
Yes. This will
seek out and delete

17:23.148 --> 17:25.282
every possible version
of the Aya program,

17:25.351 --> 17:28.153
ridding the universe
of my threat forever.

17:28.221 --> 17:31.414
Except you.
It won't delete you.

17:31.473 --> 17:34.040
The virus must eliminate
every version of me

17:34.093 --> 17:37.062
in order to protect
universal life.

17:37.262 --> 17:41.065
No! You cannot destroy yourself.
I won't let you.

17:43.868 --> 17:46.418
It is too late, my love.

17:47.205 --> 17:49.955
It is already done.

18:09.928 --> 18:12.729
[electricity crackling]

18:15.232 --> 18:19.469
Please, Aya, don't do this.
Don't leave me alone.

18:20.300 --> 18:24.385
You will never be alone.
You have a family now.

18:25.110 --> 18:28.512
And somehow I know
I will be with you, too,

18:28.580 --> 18:31.248
watching over you always.

18:31.316 --> 18:35.085
- I don't understand.
- I do not, either.

18:35.153 --> 18:39.089
It is just a feeling.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.889
Hey, Razer.

19:09.957 --> 19:13.560
Corps can't honor its heroes if
the heroes don't show up to the ceremony.

19:13.627 --> 19:15.395
I'm leaving.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.310
Look, Razer,
I know it's hard...

19:19.341 --> 19:22.134
All these people celebrating
when you just lost Aya.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.104
But that's just it.

19:24.171 --> 19:26.639
I refuse to believe
that Aya is dead.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.209
I made that mistake
once before.

19:29.276 --> 19:31.377
Red, we all miss her,

19:31.445 --> 19:34.748
but you got to face it,
she's gone.

19:34.815 --> 19:37.551
No being as adaptable
and resourceful as she

19:37.618 --> 19:39.552
could truly be
deleted from existence.

19:39.620 --> 19:43.122
I know in my heart that
she is out there somewhere.

19:43.190 --> 19:47.361
I will scour the universe if I must,
but I will find her.

19:48.255 --> 19:51.131
OK, then,
we're coming with you.

19:51.199 --> 19:56.335
Kilowog, my friend,
you would only slow me down.

19:56.877 --> 19:59.906
You get in any trouble out there,
find yourself in a jam,

19:59.974 --> 20:03.410
you don't hesitate to call us, 'cause
we will hightail it out there and...

20:03.423 --> 20:08.542
Save me. I know, Hal.
You already have.

20:19.161 --> 20:21.896
[sniffles, clears throat]

20:31.039 --> 20:33.074
I still say he's crazy.

20:33.141 --> 20:38.379
Even if she is out there, how's he gonna
find her in all that endless space?

20:38.446 --> 20:43.852
Knowing Razer, I'd say
he's got a pretty good shot.

20:55.255 --> 20:58.255
