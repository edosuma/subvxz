00:06.620 --> 00:07.620
- Previously on "Happy!"

00:09.290 --> 00:11.100
- Nick Sax.
Hard to believe this

00:11.130 --> 00:12.336
piece of shit used
to be the best detective

00:12.360 --> 00:14.300
in the whole department.

00:14.330 --> 00:15.846
- Right now you're talking
to the man who was hired

00:15.870 --> 00:16.830
to kill the
Scaramucci Brothers.

00:18.170 --> 00:19.500
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:19.540 --> 00:21.110
The Old Don in Sicily
before he died,

00:21.140 --> 00:22.316
he gave... he gave me a password.

00:22.340 --> 00:23.840
It's priceless.

00:23.870 --> 00:26.440
- Nick Sax has got his fat,
grubby fingers

00:26.480 --> 00:29.250
on my password.
- You're a great source

00:29.280 --> 00:31.520
of information.
- Seems pretty clear that

00:31.550 --> 00:34.080
whoever knows this password
is as good as dead or worse.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.320
- Smoothie?
- I'm gonna set an example

00:36.350 --> 00:38.220
with you.

00:38.260 --> 00:39.420
- Come on.
Snap out of it.

00:39.460 --> 00:43.590
I'm... Happy!

00:43.630 --> 00:45.600
The happy horse, horse, horse
so full of fun

00:45.630 --> 00:47.430
of course, of course.
- You're not real.

00:47.460 --> 00:50.170
- Of course not.
I'm Hailey's imaginary friend.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.640
The sweetest, most adorable
little girl in the whole world.

00:52.670 --> 00:55.210
But she's in real bad trouble,
and you're the only one

00:55.240 --> 00:58.340
that can help me save her.
- Hailey!

00:58.380 --> 01:00.340
- Oh, hey, Merry.
Can I borrow your car?

01:00.380 --> 01:01.620
- I didn't wanna tell you,
Nick.

01:01.650 --> 01:03.450
Hailey is your daughter.

all right?

01:24.430 --> 01:26.170
And I'm telling y'all
motherers.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.576
I ain't no mothering

01:29.240 --> 01:30.640
- Suck my dick!
- you!

01:30.670 --> 01:32.510
It's not mine!
- You know, I've been doing

01:32.540 --> 01:34.640
this show 27 years.
I've never heard that before.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.510
- Ha ha, yeah.
- Come on, Jerry!

01:36.550 --> 01:39.150
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!
Man, look at that,

01:39.180 --> 01:41.250
and then look at this.
Look at this!

01:43.250 --> 01:44.750
I would never hit that ,
man!

01:44.790 --> 01:46.520
I would never hit that!
- I'll hit that!

01:46.560 --> 01:49.590
- Oh, yeah!
- Yo, yo!

01:49.630 --> 01:52.430
- Come on, man.
- Yo, that.

01:52.460 --> 01:55.270

That's your baby now.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.370
- This is your baby!
Look at this!

01:57.400 --> 01:59.240
Look at this!
- That's not my baby!

01:59.270 --> 02:00.940
- Yeah, look!
Look at this!

02:00.970 --> 02:02.616
- Get out of here, man.
- Well, we're gonna find out

02:02.640 --> 02:05.540
who hit what and from what end,
but first...

02:05.580 --> 02:09.710
Here's another winner at life
who claims the kid ain't his.

02:09.750 --> 02:14.680
Give it up for Nick Sax.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.250
- I got no idea
why I'm even here.

02:17.290 --> 02:20.420
Well, you're not really here.

02:20.460 --> 02:23.560
This is a metaphor.
You've experienced a near death

02:23.590 --> 02:25.500
bodily trauma.
- Yeah.

02:25.530 --> 02:28.400
- After hearing the best news
any guy can ever hear.

02:28.430 --> 02:30.670
Let's give a nice hand
to the new papa.

02:37.470 --> 02:39.480
- Sorry to disappoint.
I ain't nobody's daddy.

02:41.310 --> 02:43.480
- How can you be so sure?
You shooting blanks?

02:46.620 --> 02:49.320
Which is pretty funny,
considering your line of work.

02:51.690 --> 02:55.530
- Look, any alleged incidents
of erectile dysfunction...

02:55.560 --> 02:58.230
that I am in no way
admitting to...

02:58.260 --> 03:00.006
would be a fairly recent
development from me,

03:00.030 --> 03:02.530
and totally beside the point.
I'm telling you

03:02.570 --> 03:04.670
I don't belong here.
The only thing I am

03:04.700 --> 03:08.540
a father to is a baseball-size
colonic impasse that's getting

03:08.570 --> 03:09.786
worse every minute
of this conversation.

03:11.810 --> 03:14.610
- Well, there's a lovely lady
backstage in our green room

03:14.640 --> 03:16.680
who frankly has a different
version of events.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.690
You can't even bear to look
at her, can you, Nick?

03:30.730 --> 03:34.730
What are you running from?
- Yeah!

03:49.410 --> 03:51.350
- So, don't take this
the wrong way,

03:51.380 --> 03:53.350
but looks like someone
needs a little...

03:53.380 --> 03:55.520
...nap!

03:55.550 --> 03:59.790
- All righty, now.
I accept you.

03:59.820 --> 04:02.330
You're not a hallucination.
You're not my subconscious

04:02.360 --> 04:04.730
trying to dry rape me
for all my past sins.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.430
You're real.
- Imaginary friend.

04:09.670 --> 04:13.540
Listen to me.
I once saw a man high on PCP

04:13.570 --> 04:17.510
rip off his own testicles
in the middle of Times Square.

04:17.540 --> 04:19.610
Do you know what I'm trying
to say to you?

04:22.510 --> 04:25.720
I'm saying I've seen
some crazy shit.

04:25.750 --> 04:28.820
So I accept it.
You exist.

04:28.850 --> 04:31.460
You're here.

04:31.490 --> 04:33.660
There's probably a little girl
somewhere out there

04:33.690 --> 04:35.930
who needs her daddy real
goddamned bad.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.830
And you should go find him.
'Cause I ain't him.

04:38.860 --> 04:43.570
- You are him, Nick.
And she's yours.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.870
My God.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.570
Those teeth.

04:49.610 --> 04:52.640
Those flared nostrils
and beady eyes.

04:52.680 --> 04:58.820
It's somehow endearing,
and yet so, so horrible.

04:58.850 --> 05:01.120
How do you even...

05:01.150 --> 05:03.550
Nah, forget it.

07:36.970 --> 07:39.080
Do you know where we are?

07:39.110 --> 07:41.810
- No.

07:41.850 --> 07:45.280
Who are you?
- Hailey Hansen.

07:45.310 --> 07:47.050
What's your name?

07:48.990 --> 07:51.990
Are you there?

07:52.020 --> 07:57.060
- Yeah.
- Has he hurt you?

07:57.090 --> 08:00.830
- He doesn't like us talking.
He thinks we're gonna

08:00.860 --> 08:04.830
do something bad.
Like try to run away.

08:04.870 --> 08:08.640
He doesn't want us
to go back to our parents.

08:08.670 --> 08:11.010
- What does he want?

08:11.040 --> 08:14.310
- He wants us
to stay little kids.

08:14.340 --> 08:18.080
He wants us to stay
little kids forever.

08:19.650 --> 08:21.620
- Mrs. Jablonski.

08:21.650 --> 08:24.620
It's me, Sax.
Is that cooking spray?

08:24.650 --> 08:28.690
- Oh, Dr. Sax.

08:28.730 --> 08:30.930
Oh, and no ring.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.799
I'm gonna introduce you
to my granddaughter.

08:33.830 --> 08:35.159
- Thrilled.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.000
- You can't be too careful,
Doctor.

08:38.030 --> 08:40.640
This used to be
a nice neighborhood,

08:40.669 --> 08:44.610
before all them, you know.
- Bad hombres.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.780
- Skulking around.
- Yeah.

08:46.810 --> 08:49.850
- I heard them climbing
the fire escape earlier.

08:52.850 --> 08:55.650
- Fire escape.

08:55.690 --> 08:59.690
Honey, I'm home.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.760
Surprise!
Hey, boys!

09:01.790 --> 09:04.090
What the hell?
No balloons, no hookers?

09:04.130 --> 09:06.700
Come on.
What kind of going away party

09:06.730 --> 09:09.170
is this?

09:11.230 --> 09:14.970
I wanna thank you guys
for not tossing my apartment.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.840
Wait, did you?

09:17.870 --> 09:20.110
- Jesus, Frank.

09:20.140 --> 09:22.380
- Ow.

09:22.410 --> 09:25.980
- Look at his balls.
- Swinging like a watch.

09:26.020 --> 09:28.790
I mean, they are hypnotic.

09:28.820 --> 09:30.850
- Yeah.
In video games,

09:30.890 --> 09:35.190
it's what they call...
Respawning.

09:35.220 --> 09:37.860
- This isn't a game, Sax.
- Eh, I just gotta pick up

09:37.890 --> 09:40.930
a few essentials from the
trusty old go-bag.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.730
So I can vamanos my burly
white ass on out of here.

09:44.770 --> 09:47.000
Ah.
Huh.

09:48.970 --> 09:50.640
That's a good one.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.050
And with that,
I bid you bye-bye.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.196
Help yourselves to the fridge.
I got ten-day-old Chinese

10:03.220 --> 10:04.820
in there,
but with the MSG,

10:04.850 --> 10:06.760
I think you guys
will be all right.

10:06.790 --> 10:09.260
I would offer you booze,
but I wasn't expecting company.

10:09.290 --> 10:14.000
Oh, do make sure to extend
my season greetings to Blue.

10:15.060 --> 10:16.930
- You seem confused, Sax.

10:16.970 --> 10:19.200
- I seem to think you assholes
didn't get the memo.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.770
The one where Blue
wants me alive.

10:23.310 --> 10:25.440
The password.
- Oh.

10:25.470 --> 10:27.680
- Oh, yeah, right.
So...

10:27.710 --> 10:29.680
- Yeah, we don't work for Blue.

10:29.710 --> 10:31.180
- Huh?
- We're with Fresh Ken.

10:31.210 --> 10:32.880
Ninth Street.
- Since when?

10:32.920 --> 10:34.180
- Tuesday.
- Why?

10:34.220 --> 10:35.920
- More money.
- I understand that.

10:35.950 --> 10:37.820
- Mmm.
- Fresh Ken.

10:37.850 --> 10:39.696
- Anyway, this... this password
that you talk about.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.190
- Yeah?
- It's actually why

10:41.220 --> 10:43.730
we're all here.
See nobody knows what it's for.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.266
Word on the street is,
Blue gets his hands

10:45.290 --> 10:47.930
on that password,
he becomes untouchable.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.000
Unstoppable.
- Word on the street?

10:50.030 --> 10:51.916
- It's like some Ark of
the Covenant shit for hoods.

10:51.940 --> 10:53.800
He'd wipe us all
out like polio.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.116
- And I'm the only one who...
- Knows the password.

10:55.140 --> 10:56.486
- Which is why...
- You gotta get dead.

10:58.310 --> 11:00.940
Well, ain't this
a sticky wicket.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.160
He's going down
the fire escape!

11:19.960 --> 11:22.030
Bad hombres.

11:29.170 --> 11:30.840
Ah, peanuts.

12:02.310 --> 12:04.140
- Nick, there comes a time

12:04.170 --> 12:05.940
when you just gotta
face reality.

12:05.980 --> 12:07.086
- Fuck you!
Get the fucking fuck

12:07.110 --> 12:09.150
away from me.
- Oh!

12:09.180 --> 12:10.880
Swear jar!
Swear jar!

12:10.910 --> 12:12.350
When dirty words
come out too far!

12:12.380 --> 12:15.280
That'll be 25 cents, please.

12:21.390 --> 12:26.030
Oh, crackers and jam, Nick!
Now we're flat broke!

12:26.060 --> 12:27.800
- That's right.
Money.

12:29.300 --> 12:31.030
We need guns and money.

12:32.340 --> 12:34.170
And I knows just the guy.

12:34.200 --> 12:38.340
- Great, so we'll just,
uh, run there, I guess.

12:44.550 --> 12:45.550
- This your car?

12:58.560 --> 13:03.600
- James Joyce called cheese
the corpse of milk.

13:03.630 --> 13:05.870
- I never listened
to folk music.

13:09.970 --> 13:13.610
You're more of a yellow slices
wrapped in plastic girl.

13:13.640 --> 13:16.280
Kraft American.

13:16.310 --> 13:20.220
- Just get to the point.
You want Sax.

13:20.250 --> 13:26.220
- We need to learn to take
our time with things.

13:26.260 --> 13:28.460
This wine, for instance...

13:30.360 --> 13:32.260
Mmm.

13:32.300 --> 13:35.230
Began as a grape.

13:37.570 --> 13:39.940
A sweet thing.
Yes.

13:44.240 --> 13:49.280
But also an immature thing.
To reach its full potential,

13:49.310 --> 13:52.250
the grape is subjected
to pressure.

13:52.280 --> 13:56.290
Squashed to a pulp.

13:56.320 --> 13:59.560
Reduced to its essence.

13:59.590 --> 14:02.190
Sealed in darkness.

14:02.230 --> 14:06.230
And there it waits.
Compelled by the hands of time

14:06.260 --> 14:08.900
to become a finer thing.
- I get it, Blue.

14:08.930 --> 14:11.570
I'm the grape.
- No, no, no.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.570
You don't get it.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.300
I'm the grape.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.580
I'm the goddamn grape!

14:23.050 --> 14:24.980
When I was a boy...
hmm...

14:25.010 --> 14:28.180
The Don swore to me on the
souls of his ancestors

14:28.220 --> 14:31.290
that I would get what's mine.
If I was patient.

14:31.320 --> 14:36.230
Now, I didn't understand then.
But I do now.

14:36.260 --> 14:40.560
I wasn't ready.
But now I am.

14:40.600 --> 14:44.030
And I want what I'm due.
- And what's that?

14:44.070 --> 14:46.340
- Everything.

14:46.370 --> 14:49.610
This is my time
to step to the fore,

14:49.640 --> 14:52.210
to take my place as leader
of the family.

14:54.640 --> 14:57.950
And you're in my way, Meredith.

14:57.980 --> 15:01.720
I get it.
Life has been complicated.

15:01.750 --> 15:06.020
Father gunned down
in the line of duty.

15:06.060 --> 15:09.030
Your mother...
bright, beautiful, talented...

15:09.060 --> 15:12.430
She loses her mind.

15:12.460 --> 15:17.470
You, the candy striper.
No man in your life.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.240
The only man you ever loved,
well,

15:20.270 --> 15:23.240
you broke up his marriage.
Wrecked his career.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.516
- Your script needs
a little work.

15:24.540 --> 15:26.610
And now he's back.

15:26.640 --> 15:32.080
And you let him go.
You gave him your car.

15:32.120 --> 15:35.050
Mmm.
I'm glad you did.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.390
I am.
You gained his trust

15:37.420 --> 15:41.290
all over again.
Use that trust.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.560
Find him.
Bring him in.

15:43.590 --> 15:46.260
Alive and articulate.

15:46.300 --> 15:49.600
That's very important,
Meredith.

15:51.430 --> 15:52.670
- How important?

15:57.710 --> 15:59.610
What did you have in mind?

16:05.150 --> 16:09.090
- I bring you Sax,
and we're even.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.650
I'm out from under you.
Bill paid in full.

16:11.690 --> 16:13.490
Me and Ma.

16:16.530 --> 16:19.760
- Deal.
- Deal.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.100
- What, you wanna fucking
spit on it?

16:26.600 --> 16:31.370
One thing.
I know how hard it can be

16:31.410 --> 16:35.040
to get help on short notice.
So I've dispatched

16:35.080 --> 16:37.580
a qualified professional
to attend to your mother's

16:37.610 --> 16:41.350
every need till you do
what needs to be done.

16:41.380 --> 16:43.420
- What?

16:43.450 --> 16:45.690
- Run along, Meredith.

16:50.630 --> 16:52.660
- I can't wait to see
the look on his face

16:52.700 --> 16:56.570
when you say, "Hey, you!"
"Who, me?"

16:56.600 --> 17:00.700
"Yeah, you.
That's my kid you got there."

17:00.740 --> 17:03.540
"Says who?"
"Says me."

17:03.570 --> 17:06.440
"Oh, yeah?"
"Yeah."

17:06.480 --> 17:08.579
And then you give him
the old one-two.

17:08.609 --> 17:11.510
And he runs away screaming
to mommy like a stupid baby.

17:11.550 --> 17:13.349
- My goodness.
- What, what is it?

17:13.380 --> 17:16.190
- Shh!
Do you hear that?

17:16.220 --> 17:18.089
It's Hailey.
- Wh... What?

17:18.119 --> 17:19.589
- Yeah!
- Where?

17:19.619 --> 17:22.089
- In there!
Yeah!

17:22.130 --> 17:23.660
A little further!
"Happy!"

17:23.690 --> 17:25.190
You hear that?
A little further!

17:26.230 --> 17:28.160
I ain't nobody's daddy.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.130
- Well, I'll be dipped
in cat shit.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.700
- Le Dick.
Boys.

18:00.730 --> 18:02.800
- I mean, seriously, Nicky.
How many years?

18:02.830 --> 18:05.130
Le Dic.
- It's French, yeah, yeah.

18:05.170 --> 18:06.816
I know, I've heard before.
Why don't we just skip

18:06.840 --> 18:08.476
all the pleasantries?
I'm sure you boys wanna

18:08.500 --> 18:10.610
get back to your
little game here.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.910
I need cash, Le Dic.
And weapons.

18:13.940 --> 18:16.410
- Aww, shit, Nicky.
All you gotta do is ask.

18:16.450 --> 18:17.780
How much cash and firearms?

18:17.810 --> 18:19.420
Just tell me the type
and quantity.

18:19.450 --> 18:22.420
Be specific.
- Go with, uh, 10Gs.

18:22.450 --> 18:24.190
No, 20.
And, uh, guns.

18:24.220 --> 18:26.490
You know how I roll.
Uh, small cal...

18:26.520 --> 18:28.490
Sig, Kel-Tek.
And cannon.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.160
Desert Eagle.
You know, something that'll

18:30.190 --> 18:31.566
just punch a hole
right through the center.

18:31.590 --> 18:33.160
- I ain't giving you
any money or guns,

18:33.200 --> 18:34.736
you pole-smoking broke-ass
piece of shit.

18:34.760 --> 18:35.906
- Whoa, calm down.
Calm down, all right.

18:35.930 --> 18:37.770
I admit it.
I owe you.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.546
But you... hey, let's not
forget that you owe me.

18:39.570 --> 18:40.846
- You come into my place...
- You know what...

18:40.870 --> 18:42.186
- Sit at my table...
- You owe me.

18:42.210 --> 18:44.170
I haven't seen you in, what?

18:44.210 --> 18:45.616
Six months ago since that shit
went sideways in Bushwick.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.180
- That was not all my fault.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.780
- That was bad.
- It wasn't that bad.

18:48.810 --> 18:50.650
- Very awkward.
- Well, it doesn't matter.

18:50.680 --> 18:51.926
- "Gimme this, gimme that.
I need cash, Le Dic!

18:51.950 --> 18:54.250
I need guns!"

18:54.280 --> 18:57.650
Oh, shit!
Two pair!

18:57.690 --> 18:59.590
Pass the marmalade, girls.

19:01.320 --> 19:04.530
You want something from me?
You sit for a while.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.706
- Obviously I'm not imparting
the proper sense of urgency

19:06.730 --> 19:08.860
as to my situation.
I'm getting my ass outta town,

19:08.900 --> 19:10.900
and I'm not talking
about tomorrow, now.

19:10.930 --> 19:14.300
I appreciate the hospitality.
But I'm gonna take a raincheck.

19:14.340 --> 19:15.800
- Bullshit.
You'll get cards

19:15.840 --> 19:17.540
in front of you,
you'll play.

19:17.570 --> 19:18.510
- Damn it, Le Dick.
If I had the money

19:18.540 --> 19:19.940
for the buy in,

19:19.980 --> 19:21.640
I wouldn't be here with
my hat in my hand.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.280
18 carat gold.

19:59.820 --> 20:01.280
- "To my darling Nicholas
forever."

20:01.320 --> 20:02.850
- You don't have
to read it out loud.

20:02.890 --> 20:05.920
- Oh, shit, Sax.
I just get nauseous

20:05.950 --> 20:07.890
thinking about how this
is gonna go.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.766
- So stick your fingers down
your throat, and let's play.

20:48.060 --> 20:50.700
Who the hell bets a wedding
band on a pair of kings?

20:50.730 --> 20:53.340
I'll tell you who.
Nick Sax.

21:35.780 --> 21:37.810
- What's your favorite
part of Christmas?

21:39.980 --> 21:44.990
- Sitting on Santa's lap.
- I used to like that.

21:45.020 --> 21:49.020
- Used to?
- He took me away from my mom.

21:49.060 --> 21:52.360
I miss her.

21:52.400 --> 21:56.130
- I miss my dad.
- We're going to get home.

21:58.070 --> 22:01.700
- How?
- I sent my friend to get help.

22:07.810 --> 22:11.110
- ♪ Blackness everywhere

22:11.150 --> 22:13.750
- How's black Christmas coming
for you, Pencil Dick?

22:13.780 --> 22:17.090
Bet your kids are pissed, huh?
Another year without presents.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.850
They get presents.

22:18.890 --> 22:21.990
Culturally significant
homemade presents.

22:22.020 --> 22:23.490
- What kind of Christmas
is that?

22:23.530 --> 22:25.160
Christmas is about
Christmas lights,

22:25.190 --> 22:27.430
Christmas trees,
Christmas presents,

22:27.460 --> 22:28.830
buying shit.
- Christ on a cross,

22:28.860 --> 22:30.730
just play the game.

22:30.770 --> 22:32.670
- Fourth street.
I'm guessing that card

22:32.700 --> 22:34.740
hit everybody but Sax.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.416
- You know how long it took me
to find a Wishee?

22:36.440 --> 22:37.486
It sold out for three months.

22:37.510 --> 22:39.040
- How much did you pay

22:39.070 --> 22:40.940
for that mass-marketed
corporate product?

22:40.980 --> 22:43.450
I mean, look at it.
It's like a pink perv-a-saurus.

22:43.480 --> 22:46.950
- Used to be booze and bitches.
Now it's diapers and daycare.

22:46.980 --> 22:49.790
You're lucky, Sax.
No nine-to-five.

22:49.820 --> 22:52.690
No more nagging wife.
No screaming little kid

22:52.720 --> 22:56.430
relying on you to bring
home the, uh, the Wishee.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.690
You're free.
- Yeah.

22:58.730 --> 23:00.960
Free as a bird.
Living the high life.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.506
Start the day off with
a bottle of Jack,

23:02.530 --> 23:03.970
ending it popping
a couple of 'ludes

23:04.000 --> 23:05.970
just to keep the dreams away.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.500
In between...

23:08.540 --> 23:10.470
I don't remember
a goddamn thing.

23:12.140 --> 23:15.740
- You're gonna remember this,
Sax.

23:15.780 --> 23:19.750
- Goddamn deck hates me.
- Everyone hates you, Nick.

23:31.830 --> 23:34.500
- So, did you find her?
- Find who?

23:34.530 --> 23:36.870
- You need to get your
eyes checked, Nick.

23:36.900 --> 23:39.870
- Check.
- Where are your balls, Sax?

23:39.900 --> 23:42.470
Oh, right.
I took them on the last pot.

23:42.510 --> 23:44.740
- Oh, I hate when they
take the balls away.

23:44.770 --> 23:46.146
- I'm trying to focus here.
Get lost.

23:46.170 --> 23:48.180
- Ugh, grown-up games.

23:50.050 --> 23:53.520
- Queen of Hearts.
She's pretty.

23:53.550 --> 23:55.880
- What'd you just say?

23:55.920 --> 23:59.020
- I said she's pretty.
She has a gold crown,

23:59.050 --> 24:00.990
and lipstick.

24:09.060 --> 24:11.830
- Fold.
- Where you going, Sax?

24:11.870 --> 24:13.900
- Crapper.
You wanna wipe me?

24:13.940 --> 24:16.070
- Dude's losing what little
he had left.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.970
And I'm not talking
about the chips.

24:18.010 --> 24:20.510
- Everyone stay cool.
We keep him here

24:20.540 --> 24:23.110
as long as Blue says.

24:29.120 --> 24:32.050
- The way you're smiling
is like someone who doesn't

24:32.090 --> 24:33.620
know what smiles are for.

24:33.660 --> 24:35.560
- Those cards.
The lady.

24:35.590 --> 24:38.290
The pretty lady with the gold
crown and the lipstick.

24:38.330 --> 24:42.030
You can see them.
- They're not invisible, Nick.

24:42.060 --> 24:44.570
- No, but you are.
Oh, my goodness.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.000
I have this crazy idea.
Do you wanna go get Hailey?

24:47.040 --> 24:48.870
You bet I do!

24:48.900 --> 24:50.870
More than a double scoop
of coffee ice cream!

24:50.910 --> 24:53.640
- Then you're gonna help me win
to get money and guns

24:53.680 --> 24:56.080
so we can go get her.

24:56.110 --> 25:00.980
- Our teacher Miss Palm says
it's better to lose honestly

25:01.020 --> 25:03.120
than to win by cheating.
- Fuck Miss...

25:07.060 --> 25:10.230
Wouldn't Miss Palm want you
to help me get guns and money

25:10.260 --> 25:12.230
so we could go get Hailey?

25:12.260 --> 25:15.830
- Uh, she'd probably send us
to the Thinking Corner

25:15.860 --> 25:18.670
to come up with a creative
solution to our problems.

25:18.700 --> 25:19.970
- You're right.

25:21.870 --> 25:24.570
Just...

25:24.610 --> 25:26.980
I just...

25:27.010 --> 25:29.040
- Just what?
- Ah, just a crazy idea.

25:29.080 --> 25:31.250
I just thought
we could be a team.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.250
You know?

25:34.280 --> 25:36.650
Partners.

25:36.690 --> 25:39.590
Butch and Sundance.
Gin and tonic.

25:39.620 --> 25:42.260
Mickey and Mallory.
- You mean Mickey and Pluto?

25:42.290 --> 25:45.290
- PB and motherfucking J.

25:49.400 --> 25:53.170
But...
Well...

25:53.200 --> 25:55.000
Guess you don't wanna
be my partner.

26:14.790 --> 26:20.000
- Bam!

26:21.660 --> 26:22.846
- I'm on a winning streak,
boys.

26:22.870 --> 26:25.370
Oh, yeah.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.780
♪ Christmas tree
is coming soon ♪

26:35.010 --> 26:37.710
- Hmm.

26:39.050 --> 26:41.650
Our monkey bread is done.

26:45.950 --> 26:48.760
- Mom, are you okay?
Did he do anything to you?

26:48.790 --> 26:51.060
- He's making me
beautiful again.

26:52.160 --> 26:55.430
- I love hearing you sing.
- I'm so excited.

26:55.460 --> 26:58.700
Geraldine Ferraro's gonna be
our first female President.

26:59.470 --> 27:00.700
Hmm.

27:01.740 --> 27:04.840
- Oh, I wish I could have
what you're having.

27:06.440 --> 27:08.910
I'll be right back.

27:13.220 --> 27:15.080
This isn't happening.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.790
Get the fuck out of my house.

27:17.820 --> 27:20.960
Am I being unclear, freak?

27:20.990 --> 27:22.890
- Oh, no, no.
Cops and robbers, go on.

27:22.930 --> 27:25.690
This is fantastic.
I love this game.

27:25.730 --> 27:28.000
The only problem is...
I'm sorry...

27:28.030 --> 27:31.130
but the smell of your vagina
is incredibly distracting

27:31.170 --> 27:32.800
in a small space.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.070
She really is intoxicating.

27:38.110 --> 27:39.910
Your mother.

27:39.940 --> 27:41.080
Lovely voice.
Real talented.

27:41.110 --> 27:43.480
- Don't you talk about her.

27:43.510 --> 27:46.750
- I bet... and I probably
shouldn't be saying this,

27:46.780 --> 27:49.750
because it was a time before
people became stars

27:49.790 --> 27:51.850
from sex tapes,
but I think she could have

27:51.890 --> 27:54.920
been really big.

27:54.960 --> 27:59.460
If not for her awkward
little daughter.

27:59.490 --> 28:01.130
Playing with guns
when the other girls

28:01.160 --> 28:06.070
were playing with boys.
She threw it all away

28:06.100 --> 28:09.740
to raise a flat-chested
little brat.

28:09.770 --> 28:12.240
And this is what she gets.

28:12.270 --> 28:14.840
It took me hours

28:14.880 --> 28:17.810
to get the mats
out of her hair.

28:17.850 --> 28:20.950
When was the last time
you brushed her?

28:20.980 --> 28:25.750
- I will shoot you in the head.
- Mmm.

28:25.790 --> 28:27.890
Oh, you think I won't?

28:27.920 --> 28:29.890
- I clean up her shit
three times a day.

28:29.930 --> 28:32.930
I have no problems
cleaning your brains up

28:32.960 --> 28:34.900
off this ceiling.

28:36.530 --> 28:40.200
Now you listen to me closely.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.770
The sooner you do what
you agreed to do,

28:42.810 --> 28:45.110
the sooner I can get out
of this piss-smelling

28:45.140 --> 28:47.040
geriatric nightmare.

28:48.810 --> 28:53.020
Your ex-fucker has resurfaced.

28:53.050 --> 28:55.780
You are going to bring him in.

28:57.290 --> 29:00.160
And I am gonna get
what Blue wants from him.

29:06.590 --> 29:08.200
- Like you did last time?

29:19.610 --> 29:22.140
Mmm.
I have to get back

29:22.180 --> 29:23.810
to the makeover.

29:23.850 --> 29:27.520
Jessica!
Time for the mask to come off.

29:27.550 --> 29:29.250
- Will you look at that?

29:29.280 --> 29:31.890
- Winner, winner,
chicken dinner!

29:31.920 --> 29:34.990
Some heater you're on, Nicky.

29:35.020 --> 29:37.590
- Yeah, you know what they say.

29:37.630 --> 29:40.860
Even a clock gets a broken face
twice a day.

29:40.900 --> 29:42.970
That is a thing, right?
- You've never been lucky.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.130
Not your whole life.
The hell angle you running?

29:45.170 --> 29:47.000
- Well, if you promise
to keep a secret...

29:49.000 --> 29:51.870
I got a little blue horse
that's on the top of your hat

29:51.910 --> 29:54.540
with wings
telling me your hand.

29:57.310 --> 30:00.180
- Two and a five.
Not even the same color.

30:00.220 --> 30:02.620
This hand stinks worse than
that coat you're wearing, Nick.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.600
Come on, Le Dick.

30:15.630 --> 30:18.600
You trying to bluff me?

30:32.050 --> 30:33.256
- Well, it's been a pleasure,
ladies.

30:33.280 --> 30:35.250
- Sit down.

30:35.280 --> 30:36.966
You are not going anywhere.
- I got appointments to keep.

30:36.990 --> 30:38.590
People to see.
And besides,

30:38.620 --> 30:40.160
I got all the cash that I need.

30:40.190 --> 30:43.130
But I will need
that band right there.

30:43.160 --> 30:46.160
And I'm happy to pay you
your own money for it.

30:49.360 --> 30:51.000
- Wow.

30:55.340 --> 30:56.460
- You're not going anywhere.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.380
Not till you and Blue
figure your shit out.

31:00.410 --> 31:03.950
- Well, well, well.
The plot sickens.

31:07.420 --> 31:09.680
- Do you have any idea how
hard it is to concentrate

31:09.720 --> 31:11.690
with you bouncing
off the ceiling?

31:11.720 --> 31:13.590
- It's like kissing God!
It's like kissing God!

31:15.460 --> 31:16.936
I'm everything and nothing!
I'm everything and nothing!

31:20.260 --> 31:22.930
Sucks on that like he
knows what he's doing.

31:22.970 --> 31:24.630
- You didn't think
we kept you around here

31:24.670 --> 31:28.040
all this time because
you're so fun to be around,

31:28.070 --> 31:30.110
did you?
- Oh.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.310
Sad face emoji.

31:32.340 --> 31:34.140
I expected more from you,
Le Dick.

31:35.740 --> 31:37.280
I thought we were friends.
- No.

31:37.310 --> 31:39.950
No friends here, Sax.
Only got one ass,

31:39.980 --> 31:42.320
and Blue is all the way up it.
- What? No. Come on, Nick.

31:42.350 --> 31:45.050
Let's... Let's play some more.
Let's clean these donkeys out.

31:45.090 --> 31:47.120
- Game's over, pal.
- Afraid so.

31:47.160 --> 31:48.620
- What do you mean, over?

31:48.660 --> 31:50.260
Look at all this cold,
hard lettuce.

31:50.290 --> 31:52.690
We hit the jackpot.
- My God.

31:52.730 --> 31:56.200
Look at yourself.
What would Miss Palm say?

31:59.770 --> 32:01.246
- Do you even know where
you are right now?

32:01.270 --> 32:03.740
- Hmm.
Eh.

32:03.770 --> 32:06.980
But I do have a confession
for you, boys.

32:07.010 --> 32:09.010
I did cheat.
- I knew it.

32:09.040 --> 32:11.680
- You are the worst poker
player ever, Sax.

32:11.710 --> 32:13.750
- I don't deny it.

32:13.780 --> 32:15.656
I mean, I think we all know
that there's only one thing

32:15.680 --> 32:17.720
I've ever been any good at.

32:27.030 --> 32:28.130
Merry Christmas.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.330
Mousy!

32:58.530 --> 33:02.300
- Like you said, Nicky.
We're friends, right?

33:02.330 --> 33:05.270
Take the money.
Take the guns.

33:05.300 --> 33:09.240
Consider yourself debt free!

33:09.270 --> 33:12.270
- Well, I'm taking the money.
And the guns.

33:12.310 --> 33:15.810
And your shitty car.

33:15.840 --> 33:17.510
- There.
Here.

33:25.790 --> 33:28.460
Aren't we forgetting something?

33:28.490 --> 33:29.790
Oh, yeah.
The, uh...

33:29.820 --> 33:33.560
On your, uh...
Yeah.

33:44.870 --> 33:47.280
- Don't worry, Frenchie.

33:47.310 --> 33:48.280
I'll help you with that.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.360
- Welcome back down.

34:02.390 --> 34:04.260
Where are we going?

34:06.360 --> 34:08.560
This way.
- Oh.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.400
The city's back that way.

34:12.130 --> 34:15.100
Hailey's back that way.

34:16.139 --> 34:18.840
You... You said we were partners.
PB and J.

34:18.870 --> 34:20.139
We had a deal.

34:21.380 --> 34:24.250
- Never shook on it.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.110
I'm grabbing pancakes,
and then I'm driving

34:26.150 --> 34:29.520
ever westward.
Stay, go.

34:29.550 --> 34:32.250
Entirely up to you.

34:32.290 --> 34:34.489
- He's the strongest man
in the world.

34:34.520 --> 34:37.260
And fast.
He'll catch you.

34:37.290 --> 34:39.560
If you're hiding,
he knows where to find you.

34:41.460 --> 34:44.230
- Wow.
- My dad's coming.

34:44.270 --> 34:46.870
He's a hero.
He's gonna find Santa,

34:46.900 --> 34:49.400
and he's gonna put him
in jail forever.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.840
- What is Santa finds
your daddy first?

34:59.850 --> 35:01.520
- Just run an APB.

35:01.550 --> 35:03.550
And if he surfaces,
you come to me first.

35:03.590 --> 35:05.166
- I wanna see McCarthy.
- Ma'am, I'm not gonna

35:05.190 --> 35:07.220
tell you again.
- It's all right.

35:11.190 --> 35:14.160
- I need your help.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.330
- Okay.
How can I help you?

35:16.360 --> 35:19.670
- Someone kidnapped
my daughter.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.670
- I'm sorry to hear that.

35:21.700 --> 35:24.470
But this is Homicide.

35:24.510 --> 35:28.210
I'm Homicide.
- I know.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.310
I need to find Nick.

35:30.350 --> 35:32.910
- I haven't seen Nick
in ten years.

35:32.950 --> 35:35.180
Wouldn't even begin
to know where to look.

35:35.220 --> 35:38.190
- Someone took Hailey.
And nobody in this place

35:38.220 --> 35:40.620
wants to do anything about it.

35:40.660 --> 35:42.220
You owe me.

35:49.260 --> 35:52.370
- I'll introduce you to
a wonderful detective

35:52.400 --> 35:54.316
in Missing Persons and
they'll be able to help you.

35:54.340 --> 35:56.970
But to be clear...

35:57.000 --> 35:58.710
I don't owe you
anything at all.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.560
- Hailey Bailey!
You almost done with your...

36:22.600 --> 36:25.230
No.

36:25.270 --> 36:28.770
- That's all she knows.
One picture.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.770
And from it, she...
she made up a hero.

36:31.810 --> 36:35.710
But you're no hero,
are you, Nick?

36:35.740 --> 36:37.250
- What I've been trying
to tell you.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.780
- Look me in the eyes.

36:40.010 --> 36:41.580
- Come on, man.
Put those back on.

36:41.620 --> 36:42.820
- No.

36:42.850 --> 36:45.620
If only Hailey knew.

36:45.650 --> 36:47.990
You're more imaginary
than I'll ever be.

36:48.020 --> 36:51.530
- Ooh, nasty.
Wow, that stings.

36:51.560 --> 36:52.660
You really hurt me there.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.930
Look, you know,
it's real easy to judge a guy

36:58.970 --> 37:00.670
when bullets can't hurt you.

37:00.700 --> 37:02.270
Those assholes who
were coming for me...

37:02.300 --> 37:03.586
I don't know if you
can understand this,

37:03.610 --> 37:04.810
but they're playing for keeps.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.880
- I can die.
Just like you.

37:08.980 --> 37:10.810
- How can you die?
You're imaginary.

37:10.850 --> 37:14.750
- I die if she dies.

37:14.780 --> 37:16.980
I saw what you did
to all those bad guys, Nick.

37:17.020 --> 37:18.950
If you can do that,
you can save Hailey.

37:18.990 --> 37:21.290
You can!
But y...

37:21.320 --> 37:22.920
You won't!

37:22.960 --> 37:24.706
Because you're not running
from the bad guys.

37:24.730 --> 37:26.930
You're running from her!
Because that's the kind

37:26.960 --> 37:29.660
of guy you are!
When I left Hailey,

37:29.700 --> 37:31.630
I was good!
Like her!

37:31.670 --> 37:34.340
Now I've cheated,
I've lied,

37:34.370 --> 37:37.670
I... I've snorted narcotics.
A lot of narcotics.

37:37.710 --> 37:39.010
- Listen, unicorn...

37:41.340 --> 37:43.850
Listen, unicorn.

37:43.880 --> 37:46.950
This is not
the imaginary world.

37:46.980 --> 37:49.320
This is the real world.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.950
And it's messy.
And people do a lot of things

37:51.990 --> 37:53.420
that they're not very proud of.

37:53.460 --> 37:57.020
Ordering this breakfast,
for one.

37:57.060 --> 37:59.690
But I'm gonna soldier through.

37:59.730 --> 38:01.400
And when I'm done,
I am gonna get into

38:01.430 --> 38:03.370
that hideous automobile
in front,

38:03.400 --> 38:05.730
and I'm gonna punch my ticket
out of here.

38:05.770 --> 38:08.640
Leaving this cold, filthy city
and everything in it

38:08.670 --> 38:11.640
in my rearview mirror.

38:11.670 --> 38:14.040
Ever westward, baby.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.040
And I ain't stopping until
I see that sun drop

38:16.080 --> 38:17.950
into the water.

38:17.980 --> 38:20.880
- In a city of seven million,

38:20.920 --> 38:23.750
why'd it have to be you?

38:23.790 --> 38:26.090
- It ain't me.
- Keep saying it.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.960
Keep saying it and someday
you might believe it.

38:28.990 --> 38:32.830
That picture of you
that Hailey saw was real.

38:32.860 --> 38:35.030
You were a hero once!
I... I guess that's why

38:35.060 --> 38:36.800
you hate yourself.

38:39.100 --> 38:42.700
And it's a 20% tip always,
no matter the service.

38:42.740 --> 38:43.940
Nick, they live on tips.

38:55.180 --> 38:56.980
- Come on, Nick.
Everyone in our audience

38:57.020 --> 38:59.390
seems to be ahead of you
on this one.

38:59.420 --> 39:03.930
You know in your heart
she's yours, don't you, Nick?

39:09.100 --> 39:10.876
- I didn't even know
you were still on the air.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.970
- If you run away, Nick,
you're never gonna stop.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.010
And eventually,
you're gonna die

39:19.040 --> 39:23.410
miserable and alone
and filled with regret.

39:23.450 --> 39:25.950
You do still process regret,
don't you, Nick?

39:25.980 --> 39:29.420
Jerry! Jerry!
Jerry! Jerry!

39:29.450 --> 39:31.820
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

39:41.900 --> 39:47.970
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

40:59.070 --> 41:00.580
- Get in.

41:00.610 --> 41:03.910
- I'm not going ever westward,
Nick.

41:03.950 --> 41:06.110
- Neither am I.

41:09.880 --> 41:10.920
Come on.

41:10.950 --> 41:13.790
Let's go find this kid.

41:13.820 --> 41:15.120
- Yeah!

41:18.290 --> 41:21.100
Partners?
- Don't push it.
