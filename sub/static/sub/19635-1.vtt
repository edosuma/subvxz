ELLIE: Why's she on the steps?

01:08.592 --> 01:11.223
She came to report, but
the front desk was shut.

01:11.276 --> 01:14.400
She phoned 101 from a
payphone round the corner.

01:14.470 --> 01:16.545
- Why didn't you take her in?
- She didn't want to do that.

01:16.597 --> 01:18.677
- What's her name?
- Only got her first name.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.666
- Trish.
- OK. Did she say anything else?

01:20.706 --> 01:22.706
- No.
- Right. Thanks, Bob.

01:27.376 --> 01:29.056
Hi. Trish, is it?

01:30.876 --> 01:33.504
My name's Ellie. I'm a
detective with Wessex Police.

01:33.559 --> 01:35.270
You called about an attack.

01:35.877 --> 01:37.333
A sexual attack.

01:39.131 --> 01:40.227
OK.

01:40.302 --> 01:42.342
We'd like to take you
somewhere we can talk.

01:42.402 --> 01:44.669
It's just a short drive
away. Is that all right?

01:46.871 --> 01:48.126
OK.

01:49.829 --> 01:51.106
Well done.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.747
The car is just over here. All right?

01:55.837 --> 01:57.023
OK.

We work together. This is Trish.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.017
Hi, Trish.

02:16.057 --> 02:19.353
I've just put an evidence sheet
on the seat, as a precaution,

02:19.393 --> 02:21.831
in case any evidence
falls from your clothing.

02:21.889 --> 02:23.743
It's nothing to worry about.

03:54.430 --> 03:56.422
I'm going to be with you
all the time you're here,

03:56.482 --> 03:59.362
to make sure you understand
everything that's happening.

03:59.402 --> 04:01.921
If you're feeling unsafe or uncomfortable,

04:01.961 --> 04:03.956

04:41.962 --> 04:44.470
is basically so you can have a cup of tea.

OK.

Do you mind opening your mouth for me?

Well done.

- Doesn't it always?
- Yep.

know when I'll be back.

you got Fred to bed OK?

a loaf on your way home?

Trish, do you mind telling me your surname?

06:58.549 --> 07:02.425
Trish, you told the emergency
operator that you were attacked.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.878
Are you able to tell us
where the attack took place?

07:17.633 --> 07:20.357
You can't remember, or you
don't want to tell us right now?

07:24.550 --> 07:26.230
Where do you live, Trish?

07:28.621 --> 07:30.345
- West Flintcombe.
- Oh, yeah, I know it.

07:30.385 --> 07:32.344
That's just off the coast road,

07:32.407 --> 07:34.668
- about five miles out of town?
- Yeah.

07:34.708 --> 07:37.665
Yeah, I live in town, just
at t'back of Coniston Field.

07:40.855 --> 07:43.775

was it someone that you know?

07:46.493 --> 07:47.835
I didn't see.

...he-he was having sex with me.

- You're doing great, Trish.
- Yeah, you really are.

08:28.804 --> 08:30.507
Did you see his face?

08:38.950 --> 08:41.710
And you were knocked
unconscious before the attack?

08:44.051 --> 08:45.852
Can you remember where you were,

08:45.905 --> 08:48.105
or what you were doing when that happened?

you left where it happened,

You don't have anything to be sorry about.

09:58.804 --> 10:00.026
Can you just stand on the sheet for me

10:00.066 --> 10:02.978
and I'll pull the curtain
across, so it's private? OK.

10:14.625 --> 10:15.685

Yeah, but the injuries,
they don't look fresh.

12:14.892 --> 12:16.178
More like a couple of days old.

12:16.217 --> 12:18.748
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

12:18.788 --> 12:20.825
If the attack didn't happen
today, we need to find out when

12:20.875 --> 12:23.465
and what she's done since.
If she's not ready to talk...

12:23.560 --> 12:26.040
We'll get her home, see if
we can find out more then.

12:28.145 --> 12:30.625
When was the last stranger rape round here?

12:31.115 --> 12:33.705
We don't know it was, until
we get more information.

12:33.763 --> 12:35.471
We can't know if she
knew her attacker or not.

12:35.526 --> 12:38.006
I'm not saying it is, I'm
asking when the last one was.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.176
Well, not in my career.

12:43.665 --> 12:46.600
I'm going to refer you on
to Wessex Rape Response.

12:54.224 --> 12:56.434
if you think that might be appropriate.

12:56.506 --> 12:59.687
We'll also make you a sexual
health clinic appointment.

13:00.944 --> 13:03.118
I'm going to hand you back
to the police now, Trish.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.489

there's a lot of support

13:05.529 --> 13:07.314

questions before we do that?

Yes.

_

16:02.697 --> 16:04.315
He makes really strong tea.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.803
I think he must've been a smoker
and it's killed his taste buds.

16:08.351 --> 16:10.726

it, but don't tell him that.

A number of texts and calls
don't seem to have been checked.

17:17.906 --> 17:20.395
But the door and the
window locks are all secure.

17:20.435 --> 17:22.386
Got a light sensor and a burglar alarm.

17:22.449 --> 17:24.151
I don't think she's at risk here.

17:24.191 --> 17:26.310
What? Unless her attacker's got a key?

17:29.307 --> 17:31.827
How's she doing? Has
she said anything more?

17:31.933 --> 17:33.445
No, not yet.

17:33.494 --> 17:36.494
Think she can't remember
or she doesn't want to tell?

17:36.587 --> 17:38.347
- We've gotta give her time.
- We might not have time.

17:38.410 --> 17:40.409
If it was a stranger,
others may be at risk.

17:40.468 --> 17:43.556
- Yeah, all right, I know.
- Look at the calendar there.

17:48.399 --> 17:51.361
If the injuries are two days
old, takes you back to Saturday.

17:51.424 --> 17:52.753
- Her mate's 50th.
- Yeah.

17:52.793 --> 17:55.193
Could explain why she's
reluctant to talk about it.

17:57.665 --> 17:59.785
Does anyone else have keys?

18:00.918 --> 18:04.562
Erm... Annie, a neighbour two doors down.

18:05.092 --> 18:08.915
Er... also Cath, my mate.

18:09.949 --> 18:13.275
We saw you had an invite to
Cath's party last Saturday.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.817
Did you go to that, Trish?

18:22.863 --> 18:24.943
Is that where the attack happened?

18:29.689 --> 18:31.769
Was it during the party, or after?

18:33.504 --> 18:35.224
Was it someone at the party?

18:38.063 --> 18:40.583
Erm... I was outside...

18:42.199 --> 18:46.519
...and someone hit me on the
back of the head, knocked me out.

18:51.466 --> 18:54.877
Cath's party was Saturday
night. It's now Tuesday morning.

18:54.940 --> 18:56.860
So what did you do...

18:57.915 --> 19:01.595
...between Saturday night and
reporting the attack last night?

19:03.864 --> 19:05.147
I came home.

19:06.258 --> 19:07.718
How did you get home?

19:10.644 --> 19:12.198
I think I walked.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.631
From where you woke up, at the party?

19:15.225 --> 19:17.401
But you don't know where that was exactly?

19:17.495 --> 19:19.307
It was by the water.

19:20.877 --> 19:22.329
What sort of water?

19:23.052 --> 19:24.385
Do we have to do this now?

19:24.456 --> 19:26.430
It's OK. You're doing really well.

19:30.109 --> 19:34.176
So, after you got home,
what did you do then?

19:35.451 --> 19:37.373
I-I just lay on the bed.

19:37.413 --> 19:40.983
I thought if I just lay
there, maybe it'd go away.

19:41.718 --> 19:43.658
And, Trish, the clothes
we took from you yesterday,

19:43.698 --> 19:46.028
are they not what you wore
when you were attacked?

19:46.083 --> 19:46.957
No.

19:47.082 --> 19:49.177
OK. What have you done with those clothes?

19:49.240 --> 19:51.720
I-I threw 'em in the corner of my room.

19:52.457 --> 19:53.466
OK.

20:01.607 --> 20:04.155
When we're done here, we'll
go to the party location.

20:23.259 --> 20:24.707

20:39.911 --> 20:42.000

not well and you need some days.

know what's happened.

No. Sorry.

Is there anyone I can call to be with you?

20:58.266 --> 20:59.251
No.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.661
- A friend, or a relative?
- Did you not hear me?

OK.

- Thank you.

- OK.

You'll hear from your ISVA soon
and you've got your panic alarm.

- You think she meant the sea?
- I dunno.

did she not report it sooner?

35:26.217 --> 35:28.040
How many people were at the party?

35:28.080 --> 35:30.631
I don't know. We didn't
keep tabs on final numbers,

35:30.693 --> 35:33.276
we were just telling people
to pitch up if they fancied it.

35:33.347 --> 35:34.550
Roughly?

35:36.776 --> 35:38.103
70, 80...

35:38.143 --> 35:39.457
How many men?

35:40.420 --> 35:43.840
Erm... fiftyish.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.994
There were 50 men at
your party on Saturday?

35:47.078 --> 35:48.649
Yeah, at least 50.

35:57.022 --> 35:59.342
Trish Winterman of West Flintcombe

35:59.382 --> 36:02.560
has made an allegation of rape
against an unknown attacker.

36:02.997 --> 36:05.342
Er... the incident is
alleged to have taken place

36:05.397 --> 36:07.526
at Axehampton House on Saturday night.

36:07.596 --> 36:11.261
She was attending a party
thrown by Cath and Jim Atwood.

36:11.301 --> 36:14.246
She was knocked unconscious
somewhere within the grounds

36:14.286 --> 36:17.459
and was raped, possibly close to the lake.

36:17.499 --> 36:20.059
It's unclear whether her
attacker was known to her.

36:20.099 --> 36:22.939
Myself and DS Miller took her
to the SARC in Poole last night.

36:23.055 --> 36:24.823
We're awaiting preliminary forensics

36:24.863 --> 36:27.666
and SOCO are starting
work at the scene now.

36:27.736 --> 36:30.095
- When did she report this?
- Last night.

36:30.192 --> 36:33.196
But the attack happened on
Saturday. It's a bit of a gap.

36:33.236 --> 36:34.769
Are we sure she's genuine?

36:35.339 --> 36:37.760
When you've completed your
Sexual Offences training, Katie,

36:37.800 --> 36:40.710
you'll understand we start from a
position of believing the victim.

36:40.750 --> 36:42.601
- Sure, but...
- Given the injuries,

36:42.664 --> 36:45.853
the details of her account,
matching facts at the possible scene

36:45.893 --> 36:48.195
and an assessment of her emotional state,

36:48.258 --> 36:50.255
we're working on the
assumption it's genuine.

36:50.967 --> 36:52.425
I was just asking the question.

36:52.465 --> 36:54.551
All right, you're new, we forgive you.

36:54.591 --> 36:56.849
As of yet, we've made no public statement.

36:56.893 --> 37:00.108
The Chief Super is aware. Once
we've got initial forensics,

37:00.148 --> 37:02.340
we'll make a call on the
risk to public safety.

37:02.380 --> 37:04.815
In the meantime, not a word gets out.

37:15.771 --> 37:16.539
What?

37:16.579 --> 37:18.862
I am so sorry. He's so sorry.

37:18.932 --> 37:21.368
- Aren't you, so sorry?
- Yeah.

37:26.422 --> 37:27.825
I'm sorry.

37:28.816 --> 37:30.278
Porn! Why?

37:30.348 --> 37:31.659
It is something we're having to deal with

37:31.701 --> 37:34.536
- a lot more recently.
- So it's not just him.

37:34.586 --> 37:38.176
Tom and another boy have been
caught supplying links and files

37:38.216 --> 37:39.918
to a number of other students.

37:40.010 --> 37:42.770
What? Oh, for God's sake!

37:42.849 --> 37:44.960
I don't know what you
consider acceptable...

37:45.000 --> 37:47.104
I don't consider this to
be acceptable in my home!

I don't watch this! We
don't have porn in my home!

other student for one week.

(SARCASTICALLY) Oh, brilliant. Well done.

37:54.065 --> 37:56.425
I'm mortified and
disgusted at his behaviour.

37:56.496 --> 37:59.421
- It will not happen again.
- I'm sure we all understand

37:59.461 --> 38:01.142
how tough it has been
for you as a family...

38:01.182 --> 38:05.017

that. It isn't about that.

- Over there.

give you a lift, I won't mind.

40:22.751 --> 40:24.499

40:25.186 --> 40:28.440
I dunno. If she's not answering to you,

40:28.494 --> 40:30.171
she probably wants to be on her own.

40:30.211 --> 40:32.291

- It was all right, I suppose.

40:42.761 --> 40:45.223
Had none of the questions
they told us to prepare.

There was something in my mouth.

He'd put something in there, to gag me.

I thought I was going to suffocate.

And I started to choke and...
and he knew I was coming round,

43:52.251 --> 43:58.113
so he put his arm over my
eyes, so I couldn't see him.

her attacker put something

- in her mouth to gag her.
- Yeah. I just got initial forensics.
