WEBVTT

00:50.300 --> 00:51.301
Take it.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.061
Sick of turkey anyway.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.861
Little Bandit.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.739
Want some chips with that?

01:19.371 --> 01:22.291
He was probably starving.
That was really nice of you.

01:22.374 --> 01:23.876
That's my Uncle Teo.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.753
Tough on the outside,
squishy on the inside.

01:27.379 --> 01:28.589
You believe that?

01:29.464 --> 01:30.507
No.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.717
You should.

01:33.468 --> 01:37.264
Sure I can't offer you something else?
I know you've got a long haul ahead.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.433
-Thank you, but I'm good.
-Okay.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.144
You called him Bandit
'cause he tried to steal your sandwich?

01:42.227 --> 01:43.645
Or because he stole your heart?

01:44.354 --> 01:46.356
Nope, just my sandwich.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.154
No more stealing, Bandit.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.739
You need to make a good impression

01:53.822 --> 01:55.908
if these nice people
are gonna find you a home.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.410
Come on, Bandit.
I'll get you a real treat.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.458
He's got a lot of energy.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.336
Yeah.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.548
Charles and I will take Bandit
for a checkup with Dr. Abby tomorrow.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.509
In the meantime,
we'll give him a lot of love.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.761
He deserves it
after everything he's been through.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.972
You were right, mi'ja.
He is in good hands.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.015
Sorry to interrupt,

02:20.098 --> 02:22.601
-but we got a crisis on our hands.
-What is it?

02:22.684 --> 02:24.353
Just got off the phone
with the distributor.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.854
They never got our syrup order.

02:25.938 --> 02:27.689
I put it in a week ago.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.691
I have a confirmation email--

02:29.775 --> 02:31.151
Excuse us. What do you mean--

02:31.818 --> 02:33.904
What kind of crisis involves syrup?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.573
The fire station's annual
pancake breakfast and open house.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.367
My parents volunteered to be in charge.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.578
Pancakes without syrup is a crisis.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.788
Agreed.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.381
Someone heard pancakes.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.592
Again? Okay, Bandit.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.556
What are you doing with my trebuchet?

03:00.639 --> 03:02.182
Playing fetch with Bandit.

03:02.266 --> 03:03.600
Okay, it's not a toy.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.936
It's a catapult used to attack castles,

03:06.019 --> 03:08.313
and I need it
for my Middle Ages presentation.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.400
I don't think this could knock down
a castle wall,

03:11.483 --> 03:13.569
so it pretty much is a toy.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.571
And besides, I need it

03:15.654 --> 03:18.907
because Bandit loves to play so much,
my arm got tired.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.327
Look how happy he is.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.290
Fine. You're right.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.585
Just try not to break it
until after I get my grade.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.464
Wait, where's Bandit?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.091
That's weird.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.558
He finally wore himself out.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.646
Charles?

03:49.730 --> 03:52.232
I think something's wrong with Bandit.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.193
He's just tired.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.945
No, his breathing isn't right.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.364
Do you hear that?

04:00.782 --> 04:03.160
It sounds kinda raspy.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.829
What do you think that means?

04:05.913 --> 04:08.457
It means that we should call Dr. Abby.

04:08.540 --> 04:09.541
Now.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.089
-What's taking so long?
-Don't worry, Charles.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.798
I'm sure everything will be okay.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.927
Do you know that for sure?

04:22.137 --> 04:23.138
No.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.562
-Hey, Bandit.
-How is he? Is everything okay?

04:30.646 --> 04:34.441
Ultimately, yes,
he's not in any pain or immediate risk.

04:34.525 --> 04:37.778
-That doesn't sound good.
-Why was his breathing like that?

04:38.362 --> 04:40.489
One of his heart valves
doesn't work properly,

04:40.572 --> 04:42.449
and it couldn't handle being
overstimulated.

04:42.533 --> 04:46.245
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have played with him so much.

04:46.328 --> 04:49.498
You did nothing wrong. It's likely
he's had this since he was born.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.626
See that, Charles?

04:52.709 --> 04:56.129
If it was your fault, I don't think
Bandit would be asking you to hold him.

04:59.424 --> 05:00.425
Good boy.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.094
So, he'll be okay?

05:02.177 --> 05:03.428
Absolutely.

05:03.512 --> 05:06.431
It's best to limit his activity
so he doesn't get too worked up.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.226
What about his heart?
Is there anything else we can do?

05:09.309 --> 05:12.312
There is an elective surgery,
which would require a specialist.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.398
It is quite expensive though.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.609
But Bandit doesn't need it
to lead a healthy and happy life.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.237
No more fetching the ball, Bandit.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.322
Gonna miss that, aren't you?

05:23.031 --> 05:26.493
If looking after him is too difficult,
I can make other arrangements.

05:26.577 --> 05:30.163
No. We got this.
We'll keep Bandit calm, right, Charles?

05:30.247 --> 05:31.373
Right.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.504
I think this calming coat will help.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.506
We should have Mom and Dad tell Bandit

05:39.590 --> 05:42.509
one of their "you know,
when you were a baby" stories.

05:42.593 --> 05:45.220
Those always put me to sleep.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.017
I'll play some soothing music to help.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.692
How're we gonna find
someone to adopt Bandit

05:58.775 --> 06:01.612
when he has to stay calm all the time?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.864
There's a perfect home
for every dog, remember?

06:05.407 --> 06:06.825
Hey, you two.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.660
How's the little guy doin'?

06:09.536 --> 06:12.789
We're trying to create
a relaxing environment for him.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.875
Sorry, honey.

06:15.709 --> 06:19.046
Listen, if you wanna skip yoga
and stay here with Bandit,

06:19.129 --> 06:21.924
-I completely understand.
-Nope, I'm coming.

06:22.633 --> 06:23.717
Okay.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.262
-Are you okay to watch him alone?
-Yeah, no problem.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.640
We'll find something fun to do, won't we?

06:29.723 --> 06:31.725
Just no playing or running.

06:31.808 --> 06:35.020
Okay, well,
guess that just leaves cuddling.

06:36.021 --> 06:36.855
Perfect.

06:42.319 --> 06:47.449
Om.

06:51.620 --> 06:52.621
Namaste.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.165
Namaste.

07:02.548 --> 07:03.549
I needed that.

07:03.632 --> 07:06.760
I didn't think about pancakes
or syrup once.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.888
You okay, honey?

07:10.639 --> 07:13.642
Yeah, I'm just worried about Bandit.
That's all.

07:13.725 --> 07:14.893
I understand.

07:14.977 --> 07:18.021
But remember how lucky he is
to have you two taking care of him.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.567
And you know, Dad and I are here
for whatever you need.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.903
Thanks, Mom.
Charles and I will figure it out.

07:25.571 --> 07:26.864
You always do.

07:28.532 --> 07:29.449
I'll be right back.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.916
Wonderful to see you again, Lizzie.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.587
-I hope you enjoyed class.
-I really did. It was great.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.130
I'm glad to hear you say that.

07:43.755 --> 07:47.176
I sensed
you were a bit disconnected today.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.305
I guess I did have a lot on my mind.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.640
The world can be hectic.

07:53.724 --> 07:56.643
That's why I've tried to create
an oasis of tranquility in here.

07:56.727 --> 08:01.064
Well, you definitely have.
If this were my studio, I'd never leave.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.442
I rarely do. Why would I?

08:03.984 --> 08:07.196
This little room provides me
with everything I've ever wanted.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.782
Have you ever wanted a dog?

08:19.124 --> 08:20.292
Hey, Bandit.

08:27.966 --> 08:31.720
I know you wanna play.
So do I, but we can't.

08:33.263 --> 08:37.017
Wait, I know how we can both have fun.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.397
Come on. Let's go.

08:56.161 --> 08:59.122
Almost as good as chasing a ball,
isn't it, Bandit?

09:05.754 --> 09:07.840
Here you go. No! Bandit!

09:09.258 --> 09:10.592
Bandit, stop!

09:12.261 --> 09:13.470
You done?

09:14.096 --> 09:15.514
Come back!

09:19.518 --> 09:20.978
Come on, Bandit.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.569
You're not supposed to run around!

09:29.444 --> 09:31.655
-Bandit!
-Charles.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.032
Where were you?
And why are you playing with Bandit?

09:34.116 --> 09:35.534
I just took him for a bike ride.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.620
-You're getting him too excited.
-He's doing it. Not me.

09:38.704 --> 09:40.372
Charles, it's not about what you want.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.624
-It's about what's best for Bandit.
-I know that.

09:42.708 --> 09:43.834
Hey, what's up?

09:45.169 --> 09:46.920
Something is up.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.802
This is all my fault.

09:53.886 --> 09:56.763
I should have never insisted
that Uncle Teo bring Bandit to you.

09:56.847 --> 09:59.766
No, it's not your fault, Maria.
It's nobody's fault.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.603
-You didn't even know Bandit was sick.
-None of us did.

10:02.686 --> 10:05.814
He loves to play
and definitely doesn't act like he's sick.

10:05.898 --> 10:08.025
I know, but he is.

10:08.734 --> 10:09.735
Here.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.069
Yeah.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.449
You're gonna be okay, Bandit.

10:16.825 --> 10:19.286
-I think I found him the perfect home.
-What?

10:19.369 --> 10:20.412
Mom's yoga teacher.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.957
She really wants a dog
but feels bad she doesn't have a yard.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.626
No yard to run around in?

10:26.335 --> 10:27.836
That does sound perfect.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.796
Her yoga studio is so peaceful.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.548
She's really nice and intuitive.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.759
It means she can sense how you're feeling.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.385
Like dogs can?

10:35.469 --> 10:36.637
Kinda.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.265
If she can sense how Bandit's feeling,
she'll keep him calm and healthy.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.267
Lizzie, that sounds incredible.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.394
Uncle Teo will be so relieved.

10:44.478 --> 10:47.356
He called me today and yesterday
to check in on him.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.650
Tell him he doesn't have to worry anymore.

10:49.733 --> 10:52.736
So, do you really think
Bandit will be happy there?

10:53.737 --> 10:55.948
I couldn't think of a better place.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.497
It's hot in here.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.582
This does seem perfect.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.960
Let's close our practice with an om.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.303
Bandit! Shh.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.681
They're almost done.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.434
Aw, he just wants to be part of the class.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.568
Bandit! Bandit!

11:37.990 --> 11:39.908
I am so sorry, Susana.

11:39.992 --> 11:41.493
Don't be.

11:41.577 --> 11:44.204
I love that Bandit's so enthusiastic
about yoga.

11:45.122 --> 11:47.124
-He likes you.
-Do you, Bandit?

11:47.666 --> 11:49.084
Do you like me?

11:50.627 --> 11:53.630
Are you doing that thing
where you read his mind?

11:53.714 --> 11:55.299
-Charles.
-What?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.885
I told him you were intuitive, that's all.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.679
I can't read Bandit's mind.

12:01.305 --> 12:03.098
Although, I am getting the sense

12:03.182 --> 12:06.185
he might not enjoy sitting
on a meditation pillow all day long.

12:06.268 --> 12:09.104
But he has to be in a calm environment.

12:13.859 --> 12:18.197
Perhaps, but he also needs to want to be
in a calm environment.

12:22.492 --> 12:25.454
She's right. Just like you were.

12:27.039 --> 12:29.082
Bandit would never be happy here.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.584
So, what do we do now?

12:31.627 --> 12:33.754
I think we only have one option.

12:33.837 --> 12:37.799
Okay, thanks, Dr. Abby.
Charles and I will figure something out.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.135
All right.

12:41.345 --> 12:42.471
Well?

12:42.554 --> 12:45.140
She spoke to a specialist
who can do Bandit's surgery.

12:45.224 --> 12:47.851
Afterwards,
Bandit's heart will work perfectly fine.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.061
Cool.

12:49.144 --> 12:52.314
But the surgery costs $4,000.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.816
Four thousand dollars?

12:54.900 --> 12:57.152
How are we gonna get $4,000?

12:59.321 --> 13:00.322
Here's how.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.535
We'll print up a ton of signs.

13:07.037 --> 13:09.706
And I'll make
my special homemade dog treats.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.758
Because we're selling them
to help a sick dog,

13:19.842 --> 13:22.261
people will come from all over
to buy them.

13:29.518 --> 13:30.769
Thank you!

13:30.853 --> 13:33.397
Charles, you'll never believe it.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.775
We made $83.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.197
Even if we do this every weekend,

13:42.281 --> 13:45.242
Bandit won't be able to get his surgery
for a year.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.160
Bandit!

13:55.252 --> 13:56.253
Okay.

13:59.381 --> 14:01.341
Is that all for the open house?

14:02.259 --> 14:04.094
It's just the tip of the iceberg.

14:04.178 --> 14:07.264
How many people
are you making pancakes for?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.183
They're expecting hundreds.

14:14.438 --> 14:16.899
Captain Carter said
it's gonna be the biggest year ever.

14:16.982 --> 14:19.526
Apparently,
the tickets are selling like hotcakes.

14:19.610 --> 14:21.820
How long have you been waiting
to say that?

14:21.904 --> 14:23.197
About three days.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.785
Hey, Mom.

14:28.869 --> 14:32.164
Remember you said you're here to help
with whatever we need for Bandit?

14:32.247 --> 14:33.373
Yes.

14:33.457 --> 14:35.709
We'd like to take you up on that.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.551
Good try.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.386
It's quite a turnout.

14:46.470 --> 14:48.347
If you flip 'em, they will come.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.517
You have a whole list of pancake jokes,
don't you?

14:56.063 --> 14:57.147
Thank you.

14:58.232 --> 15:01.735
Have a heart, help a heart!
Help Bandit get his surgery!

15:01.818 --> 15:03.111
Thank you.

15:04.905 --> 15:05.906
Thank you.

15:06.782 --> 15:07.950
Bandit says thanks too!

15:12.913 --> 15:14.957
Team Bandit is raking it in!

15:15.040 --> 15:17.459
Yeah. It's going great.
There are so many people here.

15:17.543 --> 15:18.919
We're almost sold out.

15:21.505 --> 15:22.589
There you go.

15:22.673 --> 15:24.967
You don't have to donate, Dr. Abby.

15:25.801 --> 15:27.594
You're right. I don't.

15:28.679 --> 15:30.180
Whoops.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.433
Hey.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.316
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

15:43.485 --> 15:44.736
Thank you.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.161
Have a heart!

16:20.856 --> 16:23.442
Well? Did we make enough
for Bandit's surgery?

16:25.861 --> 16:27.613
-We did it!
-Yes!

16:27.696 --> 16:31.325
The biggest donation came from
none other than my best friend, Maria.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.660
-Really?
-No, not really.

16:33.744 --> 16:34.870
It was Uncle Teo.

16:34.953 --> 16:39.416
He called again today to check on Bandit,
and I told him about the fundraiser.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.878
I would call today
a huge success for all of us.

16:42.961 --> 16:45.964
I don't know about you guys,
but your mom and I are starving.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.549
Who's up for a celebration meal?

16:49.218 --> 16:51.678
-Breakfast for dinner?
-You're joking, right?

16:53.680 --> 16:54.765
He's joking.

16:57.476 --> 16:58.519
He's not joking.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.191
Where are they?

17:04.273 --> 17:08.237
We waited two weeks to see Bandit.
I think we can wait another minute or--

17:10.405 --> 17:12.074
They're here!

17:13.282 --> 17:14.326
Good day, guys.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.453
All right.

17:17.538 --> 17:20.290
Hi, baby. Come here.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.088
How is he?

17:26.171 --> 17:28.882
Well, his stitches are out.
His heart sounds perfect.

17:28.966 --> 17:30.676
The surgeon did a wonderful job.

17:30.759 --> 17:31.844
Can I hold him?

17:31.927 --> 17:33.387
Only if you can catch him.

17:37.182 --> 17:38.433
He already wants to play.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.894
It's gonna be so much easier
to find him a home now.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.938
Easier than you think.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.071
He missed you.

17:55.158 --> 17:56.785
I missed you too, little Bandit.

17:57.995 --> 18:00.122
I told Uncle Teo
Bandit was coming back today,

18:00.205 --> 18:02.875
but I wasn't expecting him to show up too.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.169
Ready to come home with me?

18:06.128 --> 18:09.089
I knew it. I knew you'd adopt him.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.551
Well, I didn't know, but I just hoped so.

18:15.179 --> 18:17.514
I thought about him every day
since I left.

18:17.598 --> 18:20.893
You were right.
He stole more than my sandwich.

18:21.685 --> 18:24.396
What do you say we get on the road
before it gets dark?

18:26.190 --> 18:27.524
That's a yes.

18:30.027 --> 18:33.030
Bandit and I should be
rolling back through town next month.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.449
Will you have time to stop by for a visit?

18:35.532 --> 18:38.493
I don't think Bandit would have it
any other way.

18:38.577 --> 18:39.578
Hold on.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.289
If you're adopting Bandit,
you're definitely gonna need this.

18:53.050 --> 18:54.051
Don't worry, boy.

18:54.134 --> 18:57.012
I promise we'll play at every rest stop.

18:57.638 --> 18:58.764
Buckle up.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.434
All right.
