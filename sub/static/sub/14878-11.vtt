00:05.527 --> 00:06.928
Thanks.

00:06.929 --> 00:08.361
The career intelligence medal,

00:08.362 --> 00:11.040
For a lifetime of
service to the agency.

00:11.180 --> 00:12.933
Congratulations, paul.

00:15.249 --> 00:18.095
This place gives out more
awards than the boy scouts.

00:18.096 --> 00:20.103
As a former eagle scout,
I disagree.

00:20.138 --> 00:22.162
If the real intention
was to keep up morale,

00:22.197 --> 00:23.360
They'd spike this punch.

00:23.395 --> 00:24.370
You know,
you're still on the clock.

00:31.525 --> 00:32.412
No, I got it.

00:32.448 --> 00:33.635
Cheese? - Hells yeah!

00:42.612 --> 00:44.012
Didn't do as well on the test

00:44.080 --> 00:46.048
As you were hoping, huh, freddie?

00:46.115 --> 00:48.050
Maybe this will help.

00:48.117 --> 00:53.188
Leo says ger.

00:53.256 --> 00:54.923
What does that mean?

00:54.991 --> 00:57.059
Loss of electrons is oxidation.

00:57.126 --> 00:59.328
Gain of electrons is reduction.

00:59.395 --> 01:01.396
Thanks, professor anton.

01:01.464 --> 01:04.233
You'll do fine.

01:52.982 --> 01:55.183
Hello, professor sabine.

01:55.251 --> 01:57.919
Ben mercer can't save you now.

01:57.987 --> 02:00.355
Oh-- oh--

02:15.438 --> 02:17.406
Annie.

02:17.473 --> 02:18.840
Can you come with me, please?

02:43.333 --> 02:46.435
My name is ben mercer.

02:46.502 --> 02:48.470
I'm a former cia operative.

02:48.538 --> 02:50.238
Hands up, now.

02:53.609 --> 02:57.346
I want to come in from the cold.

02:58.520 --> 03:04.434
Transcript by Addic7ed.com

03:21.114 --> 03:27.024
www.addic7ed.com

03:34.453 --> 03:36.487
Can you hold still,
please? We're about to begin.

03:38.924 --> 03:40.592
You don't have to
stay here, annie.

03:40.659 --> 03:43.294
We can fact-check his story
with a transcript later.

03:43.362 --> 03:46.998
No. I want to be here.

03:47.066 --> 03:49.567
Polygraph for debrief of
former operative ben mercer.

03:49.635 --> 03:50.869
You entered the agency
straight out of college.

03:50.936 --> 03:52.070
Yes.

03:52.138 --> 03:53.338
You rose to
classified level eight.

03:53.405 --> 03:55.340
- Yes.
- And then two years ago,

03:55.407 --> 03:56.608
You turned your back on us.

03:56.675 --> 03:57.942
I went my own way.

03:58.010 --> 04:00.779
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

04:00.846 --> 04:03.214
Do you hate america?

04:03.282 --> 04:04.482
No.

04:04.550 --> 04:05.950
So it was annie walker?

04:06.018 --> 04:08.319
Annie didn't know I was cia.

04:08.387 --> 04:09.821
Do you know that for a fact?

04:09.889 --> 04:12.690
We need to dispense with
the bureaucratic nonsense.

04:12.758 --> 04:15.593
What you need to know
is if you can trust me.

04:15.661 --> 04:17.695
And to do that,
you need to know what happened

04:17.762 --> 04:18.930
Two years ago.

04:18.998 --> 04:20.231
I was in sri lanka,

04:20.298 --> 04:22.433
Working with my handler,
jai wilcox.

04:22.501 --> 04:24.335
I had brought a chemist--

04:24.403 --> 04:26.538
A professor named anton sabine--

04:26.605 --> 04:28.039
To meet with a major arms dealer.

04:28.107 --> 04:31.576
Sabine was unaware of the danger
that I was putting him in.

04:31.644 --> 04:33.144
Did the cia ask you to do this?

04:33.212 --> 04:35.180
Since I was deep cover,
it was my call.

04:35.247 --> 04:36.815
It was the only way I
could have gotten inside

04:36.882 --> 04:38.316
The arms dealer's organization.

04:38.384 --> 04:39.984
They needed a chemist, I provided.

04:40.052 --> 04:42.520
I was trading a life for access.

04:42.588 --> 04:44.189
But you didn't end up doing this.

04:44.256 --> 04:49.527
I met annie,
and I admired her spirit.

04:49.595 --> 04:52.730
I realized that there
are more noble ways

04:52.798 --> 04:53.998
To lead one's life,
so I made a change.

04:54.066 --> 04:55.466
You went rogue.

04:55.534 --> 04:57.335
I refused to submit
an innocent man

04:57.403 --> 04:59.737
To a life of making
weapons for terrorists.

04:59.805 --> 05:02.740
Instead, I shepherded
him underground,

05:02.808 --> 05:04.275
And I found him a new life

05:04.343 --> 05:05.977
As a science teacher in hong kong.

05:06.045 --> 05:08.079
And this is for you to decide?

05:08.147 --> 05:11.182
At the end of the day,
I can only trust myself.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.151
- What about annie walker?
- What about her?

05:13.219 --> 05:14.152
Do you trust her?

05:17.957 --> 05:19.090
Yes.

05:19.158 --> 05:22.660
Thanks, annie.

05:22.728 --> 05:25.730
We need to go into matters
above your clearance.

05:41.413 --> 05:44.716
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:44.783 --> 05:45.884
Jai, were you ever gonna tell me

05:45.951 --> 05:48.653
That you were stationed
in sri lanka?

05:50.522 --> 05:51.956
Or that you knew ben mercer?

05:52.024 --> 05:55.460
I would like nothing more
than to explain things to you.

05:55.527 --> 05:57.896
So much of what I need to
tell you is classified.

05:57.963 --> 05:59.330
The problem with this job
is that excuses like that

05:59.398 --> 06:00.999
Are valid.

06:01.066 --> 06:02.400
How well did you know him?

06:02.468 --> 06:04.502
For a while,
I thought I knew him well.

06:13.112 --> 06:17.382
Hello, arthur.

06:22.421 --> 06:25.056
You've been a naughty boy.

06:25.124 --> 06:27.492
Because I've been
systematically eliminating

06:27.559 --> 06:29.661
Security threats that the agency is

06:29.728 --> 06:31.429
Too hypocritical to address?

06:31.497 --> 06:32.931
What are you doing here, ben,

06:32.998 --> 06:34.499
At the agency today?

06:34.566 --> 06:38.336
A scientist that I
relocated two years ago,

06:38.404 --> 06:41.673
Professor anton sabine,
has been abducted.

06:41.740 --> 06:45.009
And I suspect that the arms dealer,
felix artigas,

06:45.077 --> 06:46.778
Has finally found him in hong kong

06:46.845 --> 06:49.480
And taken him against
his will to sri lanka

06:49.548 --> 06:51.716
To develop chemical weapons.

06:51.784 --> 06:54.152
If artigas gets
sabine's technology,

06:54.219 --> 06:56.754
He'll be able to supply terrorists

06:56.822 --> 06:59.724
With virtually
undetectable chemical ieds.

06:59.792 --> 07:02.126
That's why I'm here.

07:02.194 --> 07:03.761
You need the cia's help.

07:03.829 --> 07:06.130
I have a way in...

07:06.198 --> 07:08.333
A former asset in sri lanka.

07:08.400 --> 07:12.971
But I need agency
resources and credibility.

07:13.038 --> 07:14.772
After going rogue for two years,

07:14.840 --> 07:15.907
You expect us to give them to you?

07:15.975 --> 07:18.142
Yes.

07:20.679 --> 07:23.181
Do you think he's
telling the truth?

07:23.248 --> 07:24.449
Polygraph said as much.

07:24.516 --> 07:26.250
We all know you can't
trust a polygraph.

07:26.318 --> 07:28.920
We also know that if he is,
and we don't act on it,

07:28.988 --> 07:30.355
's tragic.

07:30.422 --> 07:32.490
I just ran down
the hong kong angle.

07:32.558 --> 07:34.492
St. Andrew's middle school
has won the city science fair

07:34.560 --> 07:36.027
The past two years.

07:36.095 --> 07:37.862
I imagine there are a lot of
private schools in hong kong

07:37.930 --> 07:39.564
That excel in science.

07:39.631 --> 07:43.034
Yes, but each year's winner
has credited a mr. Anton.

07:43.102 --> 07:44.502
Now, the school says
he's a british national,

07:44.570 --> 07:47.105
But the uk citizens registry
has no record of him.

07:47.172 --> 07:48.873
- Photo?
- None.

07:48.941 --> 07:51.409
And he's been absent
the past two days.

07:51.477 --> 07:52.744
It might be him.

07:52.811 --> 07:54.879
Here's what we're gonna do.

07:54.947 --> 07:58.049
We're going to assume that
mercer's both telling the truth

07:58.117 --> 07:59.417
And is not to be trusted.

07:59.485 --> 08:00.852
So we send him to sri
lanka to meet his asset,

08:00.919 --> 08:02.086
But with annie walker
as his handler.

08:02.154 --> 08:03.888
No, I will go. I can handle ben.

08:03.956 --> 08:06.324
No, he eluded you once
before in sri lanka, jai.

08:06.392 --> 08:07.892
- We'll be putting her in danger-
- she's not ready.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.660
Oh, I think she is.

08:09.728 --> 08:11.496
She's never been involved in
something as emotional as that.

08:11.563 --> 08:12.964
And we have to trade
on that emotion.

08:13.032 --> 08:14.399
Mercer feels something for annie.

08:14.466 --> 08:15.566
He'll listen to her.

08:15.634 --> 08:18.669
Annie goes. It's the only way.

08:18.737 --> 08:20.538
Bring her in here.

08:29.815 --> 08:34.118
Oh, annie, I just
happened to be walking by.

08:34.186 --> 08:35.919
Amazing timing.

08:35.988 --> 08:37.789
What'd they ask you to do?

08:37.856 --> 08:41.025
I can't talk about it.

08:44.997 --> 08:47.098
They want me to shadow ben.

08:47.166 --> 08:48.566
Be his handler on a mission.

08:48.634 --> 08:51.502
No. That is very dangerous,
and that is not okay.

08:51.570 --> 08:53.004
I'm talking to joan.
I can handle myself.

08:53.072 --> 08:55.139
It's not about your spy craft.

08:55.207 --> 08:57.708
You're my friend.
Call me protective.

08:57.776 --> 09:00.845
No, don't! I want to go.

09:00.913 --> 09:04.549
Please.

09:04.616 --> 09:07.852
Okay. Come with me.

09:11.356 --> 09:12.957
Gps tracker.

09:13.025 --> 09:15.093
I can keep track of
you at all times.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.361
Keep it someplace
inconspicuous and safe.

09:17.429 --> 09:21.199
Now, if something happens-
something bad--

09:21.266 --> 09:23.668
Forget about protocol.
Call the number on this card.

09:23.735 --> 09:26.604
710 area code?

09:26.672 --> 09:28.840
Whose number is that?
It's my number.

09:28.907 --> 09:31.209
I created it specifically
for this mission.

09:31.276 --> 09:33.044
Consider it your "get
out of jail" card.

09:33.112 --> 09:34.645
Thanks.

09:34.713 --> 09:36.547
It's not free.

09:36.615 --> 09:38.082
If you use it,
you owe me a sandwich.

09:41.887 --> 09:43.454
Everything's gonna be fine.

09:43.522 --> 09:46.624
Yep.

09:46.692 --> 09:48.326
I can't believe it
took something like this

09:48.393 --> 09:49.460
To finally get your digits.

10:00.305 --> 10:03.474
If half the general
counsel office is here

10:03.542 --> 10:04.709
Without an appointment,

10:04.776 --> 10:06.677
I'm guessing this
is less than good.

10:06.745 --> 10:08.446
It has emerged that
liza hearn is poised

10:08.514 --> 10:12.750
To print an article about this.

10:15.954 --> 10:17.455
You picked a hell of a day.

10:17.523 --> 10:20.291
We need you to get all your
documents and memos together

10:20.359 --> 10:21.626
To help us craft a strategy.

10:21.693 --> 10:23.361
What is your strategy gonna be?

10:23.428 --> 10:24.562
It's being crafted.

10:33.372 --> 10:35.339
Thank you for meeting me.

10:35.407 --> 10:39.810
Whenever my head was spinning,

10:39.878 --> 10:41.979
I'd come out here and
look at this wall.

10:42.047 --> 10:45.249
Try and remember
what it's all about.

10:45.317 --> 10:48.719
You've been gone for a long time.

10:48.787 --> 10:50.254
You sure you still remember
what it's all about?

10:50.322 --> 10:52.256
I don't want you to
come on this mission.

10:52.324 --> 10:54.559
It's gonna be too dangerous.

10:54.626 --> 10:56.194
And they...

10:56.261 --> 10:59.063
They don't trust me.

10:59.131 --> 11:01.766
I'm not sure I trust you.

11:01.833 --> 11:03.935
You don't get to decide
things for me anymore.

11:04.002 --> 11:05.970
I'm coming on this mission.

11:51.392 --> 11:52.893
You and ben will fly separately.

11:52.961 --> 11:55.429
Once you arrive in colombo,
you have to assume

11:55.496 --> 11:57.531
That you are always being followed.

11:57.598 --> 12:00.367
We'll have a series of
checkpoints to keep contact.

12:00.435 --> 12:02.202
You'll follow him to the square

12:02.270 --> 12:04.838
Near the old courthouse.

12:34.902 --> 12:36.970
Ben will look to you,

12:37.038 --> 12:37.971
And if it seems you
haven't been followed,

12:38.039 --> 12:39.573
Give him a sign,

12:39.640 --> 12:41.641
And he'll leave a mark for
his contact, lone star.

12:54.789 --> 12:58.425
So now we wait till tomorrow.

12:58.493 --> 13:00.193
Who is this guy-- lone star?

13:00.261 --> 13:02.362
Tamil warlord.

13:02.430 --> 13:05.599
Well, he used to be until
the tamil's surrender.

13:05.666 --> 13:08.435
But he buys his
weapons from artigas,

13:08.503 --> 13:11.004
So he's still very tapped in.

13:11.072 --> 13:12.939
Who gave him the
name "lone star," you?

13:13.007 --> 13:17.244
- Yes.
- Sounds like you.

13:17.311 --> 13:20.047
I think it works. Don't you?

13:29.524 --> 13:30.957
Fireworks.

13:31.025 --> 13:33.960
It's September,
isn't it? The hindu vel festival.

13:37.198 --> 13:40.867
Follow me.

13:43.604 --> 13:50.043
* *

13:50.111 --> 13:52.979
Niluge! Hey!

13:53.047 --> 13:55.482
- how are you?
- What's up, man?

13:56.984 --> 13:58.418
What are we doing here?

14:01.956 --> 14:03.623
Why are we getting
kothu roti now?

14:03.691 --> 14:04.991
It's like a cheeseburger
in sri lanka.

14:05.059 --> 14:06.159
You can get it anywhere.

14:06.227 --> 14:07.527
At the end of vel festival,

14:07.595 --> 14:09.696
You can only get this
kothu roti special here.

14:09.764 --> 14:10.831
Sit down.

14:14.169 --> 14:17.538
Try...This.

14:22.310 --> 14:24.711
Delicious, right?

14:24.779 --> 14:26.280
It's okay.

14:26.347 --> 14:29.883
Nice try.

14:35.890 --> 14:38.425
So this isn't
just about the food?

14:38.493 --> 14:39.626
It's about the mission.

14:39.694 --> 14:42.729
It's about both.

14:46.868 --> 14:49.369
I'm not doing any
more unsanctioned ops,

14:49.437 --> 14:51.338
So I don't really
know why I'm here.

14:51.406 --> 14:53.841
Your friend liza hearn is
poised to publish an article

14:53.908 --> 14:55.342
That could damage our agency.

14:55.410 --> 14:56.643
Well, with all due respect,

14:56.711 --> 14:58.412
That's kind of her job, isn't it?

14:58.479 --> 15:00.414
We can't seize her notes
because she keeps them

15:00.481 --> 15:02.549
In a safe in her editor's office.

15:02.617 --> 15:03.851
We can't come at her for treason

15:03.918 --> 15:05.085
Because she hasn't
outed her source,

15:05.153 --> 15:07.087
And she hasn't named
anyone directly.

15:07.155 --> 15:09.590
So we need you to contact her.

15:09.657 --> 15:11.358
Persuade her to hold
back the article.

15:11.426 --> 15:13.327
She hasn't talked to me
since you and I planted

15:13.394 --> 15:14.428
That false flag.

15:14.495 --> 15:16.797
Oh...

15:16.865 --> 15:18.398
Women forgive a lot.

15:18.466 --> 15:20.033
Don't forget that.

15:20.101 --> 15:21.301
You are married to my boss,

15:21.369 --> 15:23.904
So I can't go anywhere
near that statement.

15:23.972 --> 15:25.806
Auggie, this article would affect

15:25.874 --> 15:27.207
Missions on the ground.

15:27.275 --> 15:29.409
It would be putting our
operatives in jeopardy.

15:29.477 --> 15:32.980
I'll see what I can do.

15:38.653 --> 15:40.921
I didn't call ahead,
but this is time-sensitive.

15:40.989 --> 15:43.156
- Of course.
- So this is the situation.

15:43.224 --> 15:45.392
If liza hearn's article comes out

15:45.460 --> 15:46.593
And says what we think it will,

15:46.661 --> 15:47.694
There's gonna be a lot
of scrutiny of arthur.

15:47.762 --> 15:49.796
Scrutiny?

15:49.864 --> 15:51.098
Scrutiny that may force
him to leave his post

15:51.165 --> 15:52.866
As director of
clandestine services.

15:52.934 --> 15:54.301
I see.

15:54.369 --> 15:56.003
Can we count on your cooperation?

15:56.070 --> 16:00.307
Happy to hand over any
files or memos you may need.

16:00.375 --> 16:03.277
I'm not here for files or memos.

16:03.344 --> 16:08.649
No, that would be
below your pay grade.

16:08.716 --> 16:11.251
That director has taken
notice of your credentials,

16:11.319 --> 16:13.820
Your work-- nairobi,
brussels, and here.

16:13.888 --> 16:15.389
That's good. I'm glad.

16:15.456 --> 16:17.791
Hypothetically,
if you were approached

16:17.859 --> 16:19.092
By the vetting committee
to take over as dcs,

16:19.160 --> 16:20.394
Would you pursue it?

16:20.461 --> 16:23.196
<i>You're hypothetically asking me</i>

16:23.264 --> 16:24.998
If I would take my husband's job?

16:25.066 --> 16:26.667
Off the record.

16:26.734 --> 16:29.870
This is the cia, alex.
Nothing's on the record.

16:29.938 --> 16:31.138
I know it's a lot to think about.

16:31.205 --> 16:33.106
But consider this--

16:33.174 --> 16:34.241
You'd be the highest-ranking woman

16:34.309 --> 16:36.076
In the history of this agency.

16:36.144 --> 16:37.311
And you'd do an amazing job.

16:37.378 --> 16:39.780
Hypothetically.

16:39.847 --> 16:43.583
This conversation's classified.

16:43.651 --> 16:45.452
Any mention of it to
arthur would be a violation

16:45.520 --> 16:47.287
Of cia protocol.

17:06.273 --> 17:07.808
It's not a national holiday,

17:07.875 --> 17:10.176
So you must be here because
you want something.

17:10.243 --> 17:13.914
I need some advice.

17:13.982 --> 17:16.383
My move would be to
create some separation

17:16.451 --> 17:18.085
Between yourself and
arthur campbell.

17:18.152 --> 17:19.786
That's not what I
needed advice about.

17:19.854 --> 17:21.821
It's the advice you need to hear.

17:21.888 --> 17:25.392
Ben mercer, whose handler
I supposedly was...

17:25.460 --> 17:28.428
Was he taking orders
from anyone else?

17:28.496 --> 17:31.231
Two kinds of people
succeed a the cia--

17:31.299 --> 17:33.533
Those who are very
good at taking orders,

17:33.601 --> 17:36.236
And those who cannot take orders.

17:36.304 --> 17:39.239
Ben couldn't...And can't.

17:39.307 --> 17:41.608
He's extraordinary.

17:41.676 --> 17:44.411
- You knew him.
- I knew him very well.

17:44.479 --> 17:46.146
You think you know what you need,
but you don't.

17:46.214 --> 17:49.316
- I know enough.
- Remember my advice.

17:49.384 --> 17:52.352
You'd best look out for yourself.

17:52.420 --> 17:53.653
Take some initiative.

17:53.721 --> 17:55.222
And how would you
suggest I do that?

17:55.289 --> 17:57.157
If you're asking me that,

17:57.225 --> 17:58.458
Then you're not taking initiative.

18:02.930 --> 18:05.298
Enjoy the view.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.788
Lone star's in.

18:27.855 --> 18:29.375
I imagine he'll have us
picked up momentaril--

18:29.758 --> 18:31.191
Oh, hey, man, come on.
We're friends.

18:35.330 --> 18:36.330
Even though I knew it was coming,

18:36.397 --> 18:37.531
I can't say I like the treatment.

18:37.599 --> 18:40.033
Lone star has
always been paranoid.

18:40.101 --> 18:41.535
It's his process.

18:41.603 --> 18:42.669
There's paranoid,
and then there's psychotic.

18:49.544 --> 18:51.278
Remember the last time we were
on the road out of colombo?

18:51.346 --> 18:53.914
Very different time.
Very different circumstances.

18:53.982 --> 18:55.749
I didn't know the first
thing about you then.

18:55.817 --> 18:57.217
I can't say I know much more now.

18:57.285 --> 18:59.620
You don't have to know the
specifics about somebody

18:59.687 --> 19:01.221
To know who they truly are.
I think you do.

19:01.289 --> 19:03.857
Okay, what do you know?

19:03.925 --> 19:08.796
Um, you're a huge fan
of the band underworld.

19:08.863 --> 19:10.864
You have a constellation
of freckles

19:10.932 --> 19:12.833
On your right shoulder blade.

19:12.901 --> 19:13.901
You're ticklish.

19:13.968 --> 19:15.936
True, true, and true.

19:16.004 --> 19:17.471
Don't go looking any further

19:17.539 --> 19:19.206
Because that's about
all there is to me.

19:28.483 --> 19:29.883
We're here.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.868
I've been here before.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.671
Really? When?

19:50.738 --> 19:53.640
After you left me at the beach.

19:53.708 --> 19:55.342
That doesn't sound too good.

19:55.410 --> 19:59.446
Anybody who comes here is
trying to forget something...

19:59.514 --> 20:01.415
Or someone.

20:04.485 --> 20:05.586
Hello, lone star.

20:05.653 --> 20:08.622
Forgive me for not standing.

20:08.690 --> 20:10.958
Did you bring what I wanted?

20:18.399 --> 20:24.004
Just place them in my alms bowl.

20:24.072 --> 20:27.274
You are a prince among men,
ben mercer.

20:27.342 --> 20:28.542
Who is the girl?

20:28.610 --> 20:33.146
My associate.

20:33.214 --> 20:37.451
Hmm. Much prettier
than your last handler.

20:37.518 --> 20:39.753
Surprisingly lascivious
for a man of the cloth.

20:39.821 --> 20:43.490
oh, I'm just pretending.

20:43.558 --> 20:47.027
A monk would never ask for cash.

20:47.095 --> 20:50.597
How's 50,000 american dollars?

20:54.269 --> 20:55.535
Some tea, perhaps?

20:55.603 --> 20:57.237
<i>You should get something
for your money.</i>

20:57.305 --> 21:00.841
No, I think the information
will do just fine.

21:00.909 --> 21:04.745
Ah, yes... The information.

21:07.849 --> 21:09.683
Artigas has the professor.

21:09.751 --> 21:11.985
He's probably forcing him
to weaponize the sarin gas

21:12.053 --> 21:13.320
As we speak.

21:13.388 --> 21:17.324
My sources tell me he is
at nimananntha sthanaya.

21:17.392 --> 21:19.960
Nimananntha sthanaya.
Biggest house.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.428
Mm-hmm.

21:21.496 --> 21:24.231
Is that it?

21:24.299 --> 21:28.702
I'm not really feeling like
I'm getting my money's worth.

21:28.770 --> 21:32.139
Well, that is all I have got.

21:32.206 --> 21:33.907
Life isn't always--

21:38.513 --> 21:41.548
There...You all right?

21:48.022 --> 21:51.058
The tea.

21:54.729 --> 21:58.031
We gotta go.

22:19.163 --> 22:20.163
Hey! Hey!

22:23.868 --> 22:25.101
Go! Go!

24:16.113 --> 24:18.114
Just curious--
of all the places in sri lanka,

24:18.182 --> 24:19.115
We had to come here?

24:19.183 --> 24:21.451
Well, it's out of the way,

24:21.519 --> 24:23.787
It's monsoon season,
and no one's here.

24:23.854 --> 24:26.323
Where are you going?
Somewhere else.

24:26.390 --> 24:31.661
Look, I understand you not
wanting to be here with me,

24:31.729 --> 24:33.229
But this is the safest place

24:33.297 --> 24:36.199
Until we can get back to colombo.

24:36.267 --> 24:37.167
How long do we have to stay here?

24:37.234 --> 24:39.369
We can leave at dawn.

24:39.437 --> 24:43.840
You're pretty good at that,
aren't you?

24:51.882 --> 24:55.218
You got me out of
work on a weekday.

24:55.286 --> 24:57.687
I must have really
had a thing for you.

24:57.755 --> 24:59.556
Why am I here?

24:59.623 --> 25:02.892
This is an apology. A proper one.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.995
I gained your trust
under false pretenses.

25:06.063 --> 25:07.530
I lied about who I was.

25:07.598 --> 25:09.132
It was my job, and I am sorry.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.734
Not gonna cut it, auggie.

25:10.801 --> 25:14.137
- Okay, how 'bout this-
- I'm happy I did it.

25:14.205 --> 25:18.641
- You're happy you lied?
- No, I'm happy I met you.

25:18.709 --> 25:21.044
When people see you,
they see an overzealous journalist

25:21.112 --> 25:24.013
Who is hell-bent on
speaking truth to power,

25:24.081 --> 25:25.081
But you're more than that.

25:25.149 --> 25:27.250
You're principled, caring,

25:27.318 --> 25:29.419
Sometimes sweet,
and I got to see that.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.187
You can't see.

25:36.861 --> 25:41.564
Okay, you've been
sufficiently charming.

25:41.632 --> 25:43.700
Now what do you want from me?

25:43.768 --> 25:46.236
It's not a want, it's a need.

25:46.303 --> 25:48.238
I need you to hold off
on publishing the article

25:48.305 --> 25:49.973
You're working on,
just for 72 hours.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.107
So langley can
properly refute it?

25:51.175 --> 25:53.877
No. Please just trust me.

25:53.944 --> 25:55.645
<i>How do I know I can trust you?</i>

25:55.713 --> 25:56.813
You'll never fully know.
That's what trust is.

25:56.881 --> 25:58.281
That's not trust. That's faith.

25:58.349 --> 26:01.251
Then have faith. Please.

26:04.789 --> 26:08.291
72 hours.

26:13.531 --> 26:16.366
No word from annie or
ben in several hours.

26:16.434 --> 26:18.001
They've blown through
a schedule check-in.

26:18.068 --> 26:19.035
We've got ears on the rails.

26:19.103 --> 26:22.405
Okay. Stay on it.

26:29.814 --> 26:32.182
What's the matter?

26:32.249 --> 26:35.485
This article...

26:35.553 --> 26:38.888
The lawyers in my office.

26:38.956 --> 26:41.257
I can hear the drums beating.

26:41.325 --> 26:42.459
If I lose this job,

26:42.526 --> 26:44.294
The rest of my career
will be a coda.

26:44.361 --> 26:47.063
I'll never get an
opportunity to go further.

26:47.131 --> 26:51.734
I'm sorry, arthur.

26:51.802 --> 26:54.637
I think you've done
a fantastic job.

26:54.705 --> 26:57.407
Thanks.

27:11.589 --> 27:13.857
I searched up and down the beach,
and north a bit.

27:13.924 --> 27:15.124
It's all quiet.

27:20.030 --> 27:21.664
In the morning,
we'll head into colombo,

27:21.732 --> 27:23.666
And we'll get an ops team
deployed to indonesia.

27:23.734 --> 27:27.136
Artigas' biggest house
is his villa in bali.

27:27.204 --> 27:30.139
I hope sabine's okay.

27:30.207 --> 27:32.041
How well did you know him?

27:32.109 --> 27:34.844
Well, to gain his trust,
I had to get to know him.

27:34.912 --> 27:35.945
And the more I got to know him,

27:36.013 --> 27:37.247
The more impressed I was with him.

27:37.314 --> 27:40.250
He'smart, he's honest, he's kind.

27:40.317 --> 27:41.284
You couldn't give him up.

27:41.352 --> 27:44.487
No, I couldn't.

27:44.555 --> 27:47.257
When we were here,
did you ever think about

27:47.324 --> 27:48.591
Telling me the truth?

27:48.659 --> 27:50.727
The full truth?

27:50.794 --> 27:53.530
I know my note wasn't enough.

27:53.597 --> 27:55.832
At the time,
that was all I could do.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.734
So you felt you
could only go so far

27:57.801 --> 27:59.536
As to tell me nothing at all?

27:59.603 --> 28:04.107
When I was cia,
the best thing about it was

28:04.174 --> 28:07.343
Feeling like I was doing
something important.

28:07.411 --> 28:10.713
The most important thing
that ever happened to me...

28:10.781 --> 28:12.615
Is you.

29:19.216 --> 29:21.584
Come on, we gotta move.

29:50.191 --> 29:51.496
You guys missed your checkpoint.

29:51.525 --> 29:53.359
How'd you find us?

29:53.427 --> 29:55.927
Auggie can be helpful
when he wants to be.

30:04.738 --> 30:07.874
Okay, tell the indonesian
military to keep me posted.

30:07.941 --> 30:09.208
Okay, we have a tactical
rescue of the professor

30:09.276 --> 30:11.544
Scheduled in an hour in bali.

30:11.612 --> 30:12.879
We need to get back to colombo.

30:12.946 --> 30:14.447
I have a general
aviation flight scheduled

30:14.515 --> 30:15.915
To take us back to langley.

30:15.983 --> 30:18.584
So question-- why are you here?

30:18.652 --> 30:21.487
Because I was worried.

30:21.555 --> 30:22.789
Because you needed me.

30:22.856 --> 30:25.391
So your being here
isn't sanctioned?

30:25.459 --> 30:28.127
Wow, you, of all people? Really?

30:50.083 --> 30:53.152
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

31:05.566 --> 31:07.733
Let's go.

31:07.801 --> 31:10.603
Maybe artigas was tipped off.

31:10.671 --> 31:12.505
But the ops team said
that the place looked like

31:12.573 --> 31:13.506
It hadn't en occupied for weeks.

31:13.574 --> 31:15.007
Well, what do we do now?

31:15.075 --> 31:16.275
What about sabine?

31:16.343 --> 31:19.011
We make our way to
mauritius, by boat,

31:19.079 --> 31:21.480
To visit some old
contacts I have there.

31:21.548 --> 31:22.782
- Mauritius by boat?
- Yeah.

31:22.850 --> 31:24.383
What contacts?

31:24.451 --> 31:25.885
You said yourself lone star was

31:25.953 --> 31:26.919
Your one remaining connection.

31:26.987 --> 31:28.621
You struck out. Admit it.

31:28.689 --> 31:31.057
What do you want to do?
You want to go home?

31:31.124 --> 31:32.458
Yeah, to langley. Exactly.

31:32.526 --> 31:34.627
- Langley...
- It's not safe here.

31:34.695 --> 31:35.695
And even if you don't
care about that,

31:35.762 --> 31:38.865
Don't put annie at risk.

31:38.932 --> 31:39.999
Don't make this about me.

31:40.067 --> 31:44.036
He's right. It isn't safe.

31:44.104 --> 31:46.906
We should leave.

31:46.974 --> 31:50.276
I'll go get our gear and
pull the truck around.

32:00.921 --> 32:03.756
- Liza.
- How'd you know?

32:03.824 --> 32:04.957
You're one of the
few women I know

32:05.025 --> 32:08.928
Who prefers number
19 over number 5.

32:08.996 --> 32:10.963
Plus, we were supposed
to meet right about now,

32:11.031 --> 32:12.064
So I gave it a shot.

32:12.132 --> 32:14.033
Here's your perfume

32:14.101 --> 32:16.636
And various other sundries
you left in the house.

32:16.703 --> 32:20.172
Mingus dynasty and
some atari tee shirts.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.574
What, you're returning mingus?

32:21.642 --> 32:22.909
I didn't really get it.

32:22.976 --> 32:24.977
I thought you liked it.

32:25.045 --> 32:26.946
I guess we both lied
to get what we wanted

32:27.014 --> 32:28.814
Out of our relationship.

32:28.882 --> 32:30.283
Touche.

32:30.350 --> 32:33.252
- Are we done here?
- Uh-uh. One more thing.

32:33.320 --> 32:36.722
Thank you for holding
off on the article.

32:36.790 --> 32:37.823
You helped us on a
number of missions.

32:37.891 --> 32:40.026
- Missions?
- Yeah.

32:40.093 --> 32:42.361
My article didn't contain
any operational details.

32:42.429 --> 32:45.831
It was purely about
arthur campbell.

32:45.899 --> 32:47.533
He played you.

32:47.601 --> 32:50.036
He seems to have.

32:50.103 --> 32:51.804
So why are you smiling?

32:51.872 --> 32:54.006
Because now arthur owes me.

32:54.074 --> 32:56.776
You are always two
moves ahead, auggie.

32:56.843 --> 32:59.512
Gotta be in this game.
Hey, word of warning.

32:59.579 --> 33:02.481
I don't know who your source is,
but be careful.

33:02.549 --> 33:03.783
I don't know a spy who's in it

33:03.850 --> 33:04.850
Solely for the greater good.

33:04.918 --> 33:07.553
Except for maybe you.

33:13.360 --> 33:14.393
That's not mine.

33:24.638 --> 33:27.306
Hello, liza.

33:27.374 --> 33:32.778
Our next chat may get
you that pulitzer.

33:37.351 --> 33:39.585
- I have to talk to you.
- Okay.

33:39.653 --> 33:42.521
The director and
the general counsel

33:42.589 --> 33:44.323
Are already looking to
replace you as the dcs.

33:44.391 --> 33:46.359
I know. I told you that.

33:46.426 --> 33:48.027
The vetting
committee has asked me

33:48.095 --> 33:49.261
To consider taking the job.

33:49.329 --> 33:51.364
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before,

33:51.431 --> 33:54.133
But they asked me not to-
agency protocol.

33:54.201 --> 33:57.336
But I've realized that
our marriage comes first.

33:57.404 --> 33:59.205
I've let this place come
between us far too often.

33:59.272 --> 34:00.840
You have to take it.

34:00.907 --> 34:03.309
The dcs job, you have to take it.

34:03.377 --> 34:05.344
No.

34:05.412 --> 34:07.847
After all these
years of marriage,

34:07.914 --> 34:09.614
You still find ways to surprise me.

34:09.683 --> 34:11.484
Arthur, this place is better off

34:11.551 --> 34:14.387
With both of us here.

34:14.454 --> 34:16.455
Let's fight this
witch hunt together.

34:16.523 --> 34:19.058
It is gonna get ugly,
and when it does,

34:19.126 --> 34:21.994
We are gonna fight back... Hard.

34:22.062 --> 34:24.530
And in the end, we will
both still be working here,

34:24.598 --> 34:27.065
Where we belong.

34:27.134 --> 34:28.934
You up for it?

34:29.002 --> 34:32.571
You know I am.

34:36.710 --> 34:38.878
He's not coming back, is he?

34:38.945 --> 34:40.780
I don't think so.

34:40.847 --> 34:42.047
You had to shut down his plan?

34:42.114 --> 34:43.783
His plan?

34:43.850 --> 34:45.618
Ben's plans only involve himself.

34:45.685 --> 34:47.420
He has his own agenda.

34:47.487 --> 34:48.920
Flight's in an hour.

34:48.989 --> 34:51.824
I know. Ben knew that too.

34:56.129 --> 34:58.397
- Hello?
- Annie, are you okay?

34:58.465 --> 34:59.665
Yeah. Why?

34:59.733 --> 35:01.567
What are you doing
in the pettah district?

35:01.635 --> 35:03.302
I'm not. I'm at our
rendezvous point.

35:03.370 --> 35:06.338
Your gps doesn't say so.

35:06.406 --> 35:11.210
I'm here, and I'm
wearing my bracelet.

35:11.278 --> 35:13.746
Ben and I must have switched
bracelets at the beach after--

35:13.814 --> 35:15.681
- After wh?
- Uh, never mind.

35:15.749 --> 35:17.283
Just give me the location.

35:17.350 --> 35:19.518
All right, it says
your on chaitya road,

35:19.586 --> 35:21.454
And that you're 500
feet up in the air.

35:21.521 --> 35:24.790
Is that even possible?

35:24.858 --> 35:27.760
Nimananntha sthanaya.

35:27.828 --> 35:29.695
Biggest house.

35:29.763 --> 35:31.163
That's was lone star
was talking about.

35:31.231 --> 35:32.565
Ben must be up there.

35:32.632 --> 35:35.534
Yeah, okay, hold on.
This needs to go vertical.

35:38.505 --> 35:40.606
The building is owned by ceylon
luxury property development.

35:40.674 --> 35:45.811
Our wto detailee informs us that
artigas is a silent partner.

35:45.879 --> 35:48.147
We have to assume mercer is
working his own angle here.

35:48.215 --> 35:49.715
How can we assume that?

35:49.783 --> 35:51.283
He went rogue before, annie.

35:51.351 --> 35:53.152
We don't have time to
get an ops team in place,

35:53.220 --> 35:55.087
So you two need to go
up there for recon and

35:55.155 --> 35:57.756
Possible extraction of sabine.
And ben.

35:57.824 --> 36:00.226
We'll have a helicopter at
the ready if you get sabine.

36:00.293 --> 36:03.562
Jai, you have permission to
take down mercer if necessary.

36:03.630 --> 36:06.632
Got it.

36:06.700 --> 36:08.400
Jai, would you really shoot ben?

36:08.468 --> 36:10.069
It's just a precaution, annie.

36:10.137 --> 36:12.638
He's not playing us. I know it.

36:12.706 --> 36:14.440
I hope you're right.

36:14.508 --> 36:16.208
But if you're wrong,
I will not hesitate to do

36:16.276 --> 36:18.611
What I need to do.

36:41.002 --> 36:43.270
The city's crawling with cia.

36:43.337 --> 36:44.971
The only way this is going to work

36:45.039 --> 36:47.040
Is if I take sabine
to indonesia with me.

36:47.108 --> 36:49.743
You already know that.

36:49.811 --> 36:51.411
I need him alive.

36:51.479 --> 36:53.413
That's my specialty.

37:02.356 --> 37:05.358
- Come on.
- Oh...

37:19.340 --> 37:21.441
- I can't believe this.
- He's moving sabine.

37:21.509 --> 37:23.577
I have to take him out.

37:29.618 --> 37:31.518
Ben, what are you doing?

37:31.586 --> 37:34.121
Get out of here. Both of you.

37:34.189 --> 37:36.824
Let him go, ben!

37:36.891 --> 37:38.292
What is this?

37:38.360 --> 37:39.960
See, felix?

37:40.028 --> 37:42.596
I told you the city's
crawling with them.

37:42.664 --> 37:44.198
I trusted you.

37:44.265 --> 37:46.266
The truth is complicated.

37:50.438 --> 37:51.572
Get him out of here! Go!

37:57.212 --> 37:58.545
They've got him. Go!

38:16.931 --> 38:19.233
Put it down. Put it down.

38:57.372 --> 38:59.440
Aah!

39:17.625 --> 39:18.525
Aah!

39:23.164 --> 39:26.366
Annie, we've gotta
get up to the roof!

40:18.253 --> 40:20.187
Come on.

40:42.377 --> 40:43.443
Hurry!

40:51.819 --> 40:53.453
Ben!

40:53.521 --> 40:55.889
* don't let your
soul get lonely *

40:55.957 --> 40:58.158
* child, it's only time *

40:58.226 --> 41:00.794
* it will go by *

41:00.862 --> 41:08.602
* *

41:08.670 --> 41:12.906
* don't look for love
in faces, places *

41:12.974 --> 41:18.412
* it's in you that's
where you'll find *

41:18.479 --> 41:25.686
* *

41:31.826 --> 41:36.663
Ben. Ben!

41:36.731 --> 41:41.001
* be here now *

41:41.069 --> 41:44.671
* be here *

41:47.642 --> 41:53.113
* be here *

41:53.181 --> 41:57.384
* be here now *

41:57.452 --> 42:00.454
* be here *
