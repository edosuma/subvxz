03:31.774 --> 03:35.319
"Hunger teaches new skills."

03:45.121 --> 03:47.164
"Rome is eternal," my friend.

03:48.999 --> 03:50.876
Oh, God!
So sorry!

03:52.211 --> 03:53.754
Everything OK? Did you hurt yourself?

05:59.588 --> 06:06.846
"Greetings, woman. I behold your
countenance with cheerful delight."

06:39.879 --> 06:41.839
Good morning.
-Good morning.

06:49.722 --> 06:52.349
Should I come back later?

07:00.483 --> 07:02.902
This is the programme for Friday.

07:03.652 --> 07:06.530
We'll go through it all again tomorrow.

07:12.536 --> 07:14.538
Is your mother coming?

07:15.331 --> 07:20.127
Never in a million years, she said.

07:20.378 --> 07:25.966
Won't this sun ever stop shining?
Who can bear this?

07:26.634 --> 07:28.511
Thanks.

07:35.893 --> 07:38.688
Hello.
-Hello.

08:49.091 --> 08:52.595
How was it for you
when you became a novice?

08:54.472 --> 08:57.558
When I knelt down
to receive the blessing,

08:57.933 --> 09:03.606
all I could think of was
the price tags on the soles of my shoes.

09:03.731 --> 09:06.734
I couldn't remember
if I'd removed them or not.

09:07.526 --> 09:10.571
The shoes were brand new.

09:14.116 --> 09:21.082
Don't demand especially
deep feelings or thoughts of yourself.

09:22.416 --> 09:26.128
Inner peace cannot be enforced.

09:26.921 --> 09:30.424
One must seduce it for years
until it surrenders.

09:34.512 --> 09:36.722
And had you removed the price tags?

09:37.973 --> 09:39.141
Yes.

09:47.775 --> 09:49.443
Thank you.

09:50.194 --> 09:52.154
I’d have never taken this decision without you.

09:52.238 --> 09:54.532
I'd never have had the courage.

11:44.058 --> 11:45.893
Police! Police!

11:51.440 --> 11:54.026
Excuse me. Is that your suitcase?

16:13.411 --> 16:17.665
"It fills us with great enchantment..."

16:17.915 --> 16:20.876
"...to see your beautiful face!"

16:21.419 --> 16:24.880
"The time is ripe!"

17:07.964 --> 17:09.550
Thank you.

18:56.282 --> 18:58.576
Excuse me?
Can I take it with me now?

18:58.701 --> 19:02.580
Of course. It's beautiful.
When's the big day, my dear?

19:02.788 --> 19:04.081
Friday.

19:04.290 --> 19:05.416
Lovely.
-Thanks.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.209
Have a wonderful day!

20:07.353 --> 20:08.938
I don't give a shit about it.

20:09.313 --> 20:11.315
They're all faggots.

20:11.440 --> 20:15.111
If I could, I'd smack them the head
with a hammer, too.

20:15.403 --> 20:17.029
All of them.

24:09.470 --> 24:11.889
No! What's wrong with this thing?

25:51.697 --> 25:54.075
Fascists, Communists,
the French Revolution,

25:54.158 --> 25:57.244
the discovery of America...

27:01.684 --> 27:04.854
Maria! Good evening!

27:07.064 --> 27:08.524
Kiss the hand!

27:16.240 --> 27:17.491
Thank you very much!

29:50.811 --> 29:54.023
Excuse me? Is this the bachelorette party?

35:57.178 --> 35:59.388
Hello. Good morning.
-Hello, Maria.

36:01.682 --> 36:03.434
Maria!
Hello!

36:03.517 --> 36:05.895
Hello, Lisa!
How are you?

36:06.771 --> 36:09.106
Friday?
-Yes.

36:09.357 --> 36:11.275
Are you excited?

36:12.151 --> 36:16.322
You're positively radiant!
I've never seen you like this.

36:16.697 --> 36:19.992
Well, that's the weather and the light.

36:20.117 --> 36:22.119
No, no, you can't fool me.

36:22.370 --> 36:24.288
This fulfillment...

36:24.997 --> 36:28.292
It's so lovely. I'm so happy
you're joining us. -Maria!

36:28.459 --> 36:31.796
Hello, Berta. -What happened?
You're shining like the sun!

36:31.962 --> 36:34.173
She's joining us on Friday.

36:34.465 --> 36:37.593
Hold on to that joy. That glow.
-Yes.

36:37.760 --> 36:42.098
Enough about this silly glow.
I have to meet Francesca. See you later.

36:42.181 --> 36:43.307
Goodbye.

41:54.326 --> 41:56.912
Stop treating me like a child!

41:56.996 --> 42:01.292
I had many lovers, but
luckily Jesus wasn’t one of them!

42:01.417 --> 42:05.004
Is this how you honour your mother?
-Mum, I'm honouring you.

42:05.087 --> 42:08.758
Why can't you be happy for me?

42:08.883 --> 42:12.762
I can. But if you became a fascist,
I wouldn't be happy either.

42:12.845 --> 42:16.223
So, a humble life in a convent
is the same as fascism. Wonderful!

42:16.307 --> 42:19.435
Weren't the crusades
wars of extermination?

42:19.560 --> 42:22.271
Ah, but gulags never existed?
30 million people never died?

42:22.355 --> 42:26.609
That was Stalinism! -And the Crusades
happened a thousand years ago!

42:31.072 --> 42:33.199
At least come
and have a look at it once.

42:34.992 --> 42:36.410
No.

42:36.494 --> 42:39.955
I've spent my whole life
fighting for freedom.

42:40.247 --> 42:44.502
I'm not setting foot in that prison.

42:45.961 --> 42:47.380
Good.

44:11.464 --> 44:13.716
I love you.

44:16.969 --> 44:18.846
I love you.

44:27.897 --> 44:32.109
... that I love you.

44:34.820 --> 44:38.491
I love you.

44:38.616 --> 44:42.453
I love you.

44:50.795 --> 44:51.670
The elk

44:51.754 --> 44:52.755
The elk prances

44:52.838 --> 44:53.214
The elk prances over the

44:53.297 --> 44:55.508
The elk prances over the creek.

44:55.591 --> 44:58.094
Excuse me, can you read that?
The elk prances over the creek.

44:58.177 --> 45:01.138
The elk prances over the creek.

46:04.493 --> 46:08.998
What's this? Unbelievable!
I didn't know there was a gate!

47:07.264 --> 47:09.266
All I want is another Gin Fizz.

47:10.059 --> 47:13.979
I've been here eight years,
but no one will give me a Gin Fizz.

47:14.105 --> 47:16.691
No one respects the elderly anymore.

47:17.566 --> 47:22.029
Just one more Gin Fizz, then I can go.

47:26.367 --> 47:27.993
Don't listen to her.

47:28.119 --> 47:30.204
She's possessed by the devil.

47:30.454 --> 47:34.333
I'm just a tourist in my own life now.

47:34.875 --> 47:36.252
Worse.

47:36.377 --> 47:39.130
I'm already dead.

47:40.256 --> 47:42.633
And all I want...

47:43.259 --> 47:45.845
is one last Gin Fizz.

48:59.877 --> 49:02.004
Everything's fine.

49:58.978 --> 50:01.105
Our poor Reverend Mother...

50:02.273 --> 50:04.525
She had a secret love affair.

50:04.984 --> 50:07.069
They found out.

50:07.611 --> 50:09.989
How do you know?

50:11.198 --> 50:14.160
She couldn't bear
the double life anymore.

50:15.411 --> 50:17.872
So she had to accept the consequences.

50:18.164 --> 50:21.208
And now she can't even get
a proper burial.

50:21.333 --> 50:22.543
It's a tragedy.

50:22.626 --> 50:24.086
Why?

50:24.211 --> 50:27.548
Suicide is a mortal sin
which can no longer be confessed.

50:28.632 --> 50:31.510
So a Christian burial isn't possible.

50:31.635 --> 50:33.304
Yes, but...

50:34.305 --> 50:36.307
...but, today it's not like that anymore, is it?

50:36.432 --> 50:39.435
In particularly severe cases, it is.

50:49.779 --> 50:54.492
Remember yesterday when you said
I was glowing?

50:54.575 --> 50:55.868
Yes.

50:56.243 --> 51:00.081
That was because
I was up all night fucking.

51:03.918 --> 51:06.837
But we're still sharing a room, right?

52:05.521 --> 52:06.897
Why are you here, Mum?

52:07.023 --> 52:09.275
Communism this Catholicism that...

52:09.608 --> 52:12.403
a mother should always be there,

52:12.570 --> 52:15.406
when her daughter needs a tissue.

52:15.531 --> 52:17.283
Thanks.

52:23.205 --> 52:25.583
No matter where you go...

52:26.292 --> 52:29.295
people are all the same, aren't they?

52:29.962 --> 52:32.048
Yes. Unfortunately.

52:32.173 --> 52:34.842
Or fortunately.
Depends how you look at it.

55:39.443 --> 55:40.778
Hello.

58:14.306 --> 58:16.726
God - the father, Son,
and Holy Ghost?

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:30.920
Enjoy your stay!

01:09:56.717 --> 01:09:59.678
"The time does not call for a general."

01:10:00.888 --> 01:10:03.140
"Every thing has its time."

01:11:43.657 --> 01:11:48.704
I'll stand near you
in case you need a tissue.

01:11:48.954 --> 01:11:52.583
Even in Vietnam!
-I know.

01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:40.816
So, are you going far away?

01:13:44.236 --> 01:13:46.739
As far as possible.

01:13:47.365 --> 01:13:52.578
Well, Rome in the summer...
Who can stand it?

01:13:53.204 --> 01:13:57.833
All the tourists, the heat...

01:13:58.584 --> 01:14:00.878
Total chaos!

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:37.725
Wait a second.

01:16:35.032 --> 01:16:35.950
It's true.

01:16:36.075 --> 01:16:37.743
That's exactly how it was.

01:18:12.463 --> 01:18:16.967
"If God is on our side,
who can be against us?"

01:21:24.697 --> 01:21:27.992
I'll never forget
how beautifully he said that.

01:21:29.243 --> 01:21:34.582
Maybe the most beautiful thing
I've ever heard.

01:21:37.084 --> 01:21:39.712
Do you know the bank on the Pincio,
near Villa Borghese?

01:21:40.004 --> 01:21:41.881
Holy mother of God!

01:21:42.214 --> 01:21:44.508
How do you know about that?

01:23:47.882 --> 01:23:49.091
Let's go.
Juanita!
