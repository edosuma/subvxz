03:12.594 --> 03:15.427
SAGAN:
The cosmos is all that is...

03:15.630 --> 03:18.758
...or ever was or ever will be.

03:19.133 --> 03:22.591
Our contemplations of
the cosmos stir us.

03:24.205 --> 03:27.902
There is a tingling in the spine,
a catch in the voice...

03:28.109 --> 03:31.567
...a faint sensation,
as if a distant memory...

03:31.779 --> 03:34.145
...of falling from a great height.

03:34.349 --> 03:38.479
We know we are approaching
the grandest of mysteries.

03:43.191 --> 03:46.092
The size and age of the cosmos...

03:46.294 --> 03:48.762
...are beyond ordinary
human understanding.

03:48.963 --> 03:53.559
Lost somewhere between
immensity and eternity...

03:53.768 --> 03:56.703
...is our tiny planetary home,
the Earth.

03:56.905 --> 04:00.136
For the first time,
we have the power to decide...

04:00.341 --> 04:02.935
...the fate of our planet
and ourselves.

04:03.144 --> 04:04.975
This is a time of great danger.

04:05.179 --> 04:09.411
But our species is
young and curious and brave.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.312
It shows much promise.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.646
In the last few millennia,
we've made...

04:13.855 --> 04:16.722
...the most astonishing
and unexpected discoveries...

04:16.925 --> 04:20.156
...about the cosmos
and our place within it.

04:20.361 --> 04:23.159
I believe our future depends
powerfully on...

04:23.364 --> 04:25.696
...how well we understand
this cosmos...

04:25.900 --> 04:29.028
...in which we float
like a mote of dust...

04:29.237 --> 04:31.068
...in the morning sky.

04:31.773 --> 04:34.173
(SEA GULL CHIRPS)

04:36.244 --> 04:40.305
We're about to begin a journey
through the cosmos.

04:41.182 --> 04:44.174
We'll encounter galaxies and suns
and planets...

04:44.385 --> 04:46.319
...life and consciousness...

04:46.521 --> 04:50.287
...coming into being,
evolving and perishing.

04:50.758 --> 04:54.216
Worlds of ice and stars of diamond.

04:54.429 --> 04:56.420
Atoms as massive as suns...

04:56.631 --> 04:59.623
...and universes smaller than atoms.

05:00.001 --> 05:02.367
But it's also a story
of our own planet...

05:02.570 --> 05:05.164
...and the plants and animals
that share it with us.

05:05.373 --> 05:08.433
And it's a story about us:

05:08.643 --> 05:12.044
How we achieved our present
understanding of the cosmos...

05:12.246 --> 05:15.545
...how the cosmos has shaped
our evolution and our culture...

05:15.750 --> 05:17.342
...and what our fate may be.

05:22.590 --> 05:25.923
<i>We wish to pursue the truth,</i>
<i>no matter where it leads.</i>

05:26.127 --> 05:30.496
<i>But to find the truth, we need</i>
<i>imagination and skepticism both.</i>

05:30.698 --> 05:32.962
<i>We will not be afraid to speculate.</i>

05:33.167 --> 05:37.604
<i>But we will be careful to distinguish</i>
<i>speculation from fact.</i>

05:37.805 --> 05:42.435
<i>The cosmos is full beyond measure</i>
<i>of elegant truths...</i>

05:42.643 --> 05:44.941
<i>... of exquisite interrelationships...</i>

05:45.146 --> 05:48.138
<i>... of the awesome machinery of nature.</i>

05:49.417 --> 05:53.979
The surface of the Earth is
the shore of the cosmic ocean.

05:54.188 --> 05:57.555
On this shore, we have learned
most of what we know.

05:57.759 --> 06:00.319
Recently, we've waded
a little way out...

06:00.528 --> 06:04.794
...maybe ankle-deep,
and the water seems inviting.

06:05.233 --> 06:09.795
Some part of our being knows
this is where we came from.

06:10.004 --> 06:12.438
We long to return.

06:12.807 --> 06:13.899
And we can.

06:14.108 --> 06:18.238
Because the cosmos is also within us.
We're made of star-stuff.

06:18.446 --> 06:22.849
We are a way for the cosmos
to know itself.

06:23.184 --> 06:25.778
The journey for each of us
begins here.

06:26.187 --> 06:29.884
We're going to explore the cosmos
in a ship of the imagination...

06:30.091 --> 06:34.323
...unfettered by ordinary limits
on speed and size...

06:34.529 --> 06:37.259
...drawn by the music
of cosmic harmonies...

06:37.465 --> 06:39.865
...it can take us anywhere
in space and time.

06:40.802 --> 06:42.861
Perfect as a snowflake...

06:43.271 --> 06:46.832
...organic as a dandelion seed...

06:47.041 --> 06:48.201
...it will carry us...

06:48.409 --> 06:52.277
...to worlds of dreams
and worlds of facts.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.271
Come with me.

07:05.393 --> 07:10.296
<i>Before us is the cosmos</i>
<i>on the grandest scale we know.</i>

07:15.703 --> 07:18.137
<i>We are far from the shores of Earth...</i>

07:18.339 --> 07:21.467
<i>... in the uncharted reaches</i>
<i>of the cosmic ocean.</i>

07:21.676 --> 07:25.168
<i>Strewn like sea froth</i>
<i>on the waves of space...</i>

07:25.379 --> 07:28.109
<i>... are innumerable</i>
<i>faint tendrils of light.</i>

07:28.316 --> 07:30.682
<i>Some of them containing hundreds...</i>

07:30.885 --> 07:34.082
<i>... of billions of suns.</i>

07:34.288 --> 07:36.950
<i>These are the galaxies...</i>

07:37.158 --> 07:41.185
<i>... drifting endlessly</i>
<i>in the great cosmic dark.</i>

07:43.898 --> 07:45.889
<i>In our ship of the imagination...</i>

07:46.100 --> 07:50.161
<i>... we are halfway to the edge</i>
<i>of the known universe.</i>

07:59.514 --> 08:02.972
<i>In this, the first of</i>
<i>our cosmic voyages...</i>

08:03.217 --> 08:07.813
<i>... we begin to explore the universe</i>
<i>revealed by science.</i>

08:14.729 --> 08:19.632
<i>Our course will eventually carry us</i>
<i>to a far-off and exotic world.</i>

08:19.834 --> 08:22.826
<i>But from the depths of space,</i>
<i>we cannot detect even...</i>

08:23.037 --> 08:26.268
<i>... the cluster of galaxies</i>
<i>in which our Milky Way is embedded...</i>

08:26.474 --> 08:29.307
<i>... much less the sun or the Earth.</i>

08:45.693 --> 08:48.127
<i>We are in the realm</i>
<i>of the galaxies...</i>

08:48.329 --> 08:51.765
<i>... 8 billion light years from home.</i>

08:56.537 --> 09:01.167
<i>No matter where we travel,</i>
<i>the patterns of nature are the same...</i>

09:01.375 --> 09:04.867
<i>... as in the form</i>
<i>of this spiral galaxy.</i>

09:06.981 --> 09:09.814
<i>The same laws of physics</i>
<i>apply everywhere...</i>

09:10.017 --> 09:12.144
<i>... throughout the cosmos.</i>

09:17.391 --> 09:20.485
<i>But we have just begun to</i>
<i>understand these laws.</i>

09:20.695 --> 09:24.791
<i>The universe is rich in mystery.</i>

09:29.437 --> 09:31.997
<i>Near the center of</i>
<i>a cluster of galaxies...</i>

09:32.206 --> 09:36.006
<i>... there's sometimes a rogue,</i>
<i>elliptical galaxy...</i>

09:36.210 --> 09:38.269
<i>... made of a trillion suns...</i>

09:38.479 --> 09:40.674
<i>... which devours its neighbors.</i>

09:40.881 --> 09:43.111
<i>Perhaps this cyclone of stars...</i>

09:43.317 --> 09:46.445
<i>... is what astronomers on Earth</i>
<i>call a quasar.</i>

10:02.403 --> 10:05.804
<i>Our ordinary measures</i>
<i>of distance fail us...</i>

10:06.007 --> 10:08.771
<i>... here in the realm of the galaxies.</i>

10:08.976 --> 10:11.570
<i>We need a much larger unit:</i>
<i>the light year.</i>

10:11.779 --> 10:14.339
<i>It measures how far</i>
<i>light travels in a year...</i>

10:14.548 --> 10:17.449
<i>... nearly 10 trillion kilometers.</i>

10:17.652 --> 10:22.214
<i>It measures not time,</i>
<i>but enormous distances.</i>

10:35.970 --> 10:37.699
<i>In the Hercules cluster...</i>

10:37.905 --> 10:42.365
<i>... the individual galaxies are</i>
<i>about 300,000 light years apart.</i>

10:42.576 --> 10:46.307
<i>So light takes about 300,000 years...</i>

10:46.514 --> 10:49.711
<i>... to go from one galaxy to another.</i>

10:53.020 --> 10:56.581
<i>Like stars and planets and people...</i>

10:56.791 --> 11:00.955
<i>... galaxies are born, live and die.</i>

11:01.462 --> 11:05.455
<i>They may all experience</i>
<i>a tumultuous adolescence.</i>

11:05.666 --> 11:09.796
<i>During their first 100 million years,</i>
<i>their cores may explode.</i>

11:10.004 --> 11:12.939
<i>Seen in radio light,</i>
<i>great jets of energy...</i>

11:13.140 --> 11:16.268
<i>... pour out and echo</i>
<i>across the cosmos.</i>

11:17.378 --> 11:21.815
<i>Worlds near the core or along</i>
<i>the jets would be incinerated.</i>

11:22.616 --> 11:26.575
<i>I wonder how many planets</i>
<i>and how many civilizations...</i>

11:26.787 --> 11:28.652
<i>... might be destroyed.</i>

11:36.731 --> 11:40.565
<i>In the Pegasus cluster,</i>
<i>there's a ring galaxy...</i>

11:40.768 --> 11:43.931
<i>... the wreckage left from</i>
<i>the collision of two galaxies.</i>

11:44.138 --> 11:47.699
<i>A splash in the cosmic pond.</i>

11:48.175 --> 11:51.611
<i>Individual galaxies may</i>
<i>explode and collide...</i>

11:51.812 --> 11:55.304
<i>... and their constituent stars</i>
<i>may blow up as well.</i>

11:56.150 --> 11:58.516
<i>In this supernova explosion...</i>

11:58.719 --> 12:02.849
<i>... a single star outshines</i>
<i>the rest of its galaxy.</i>

12:05.593 --> 12:09.051
<i>We are approaching what</i>
<i>astronomers on Earth call...</i>

12:09.263 --> 12:11.493
<i>... the Local Group.</i>

12:13.267 --> 12:18.204
<i>Three million light years across,</i>
<i>it contains some 20 galaxies.</i>

12:19.240 --> 12:22.869
<i>It's a sparse and rather typical</i>
<i>chain of islands...</i>

12:23.077 --> 12:25.875
<i>... in the immense cosmic ocean.</i>

12:26.914 --> 12:31.044
<i>We are now only 2 million</i>
<i>light years from home.</i>

12:32.119 --> 12:35.555
<i>On the maps of space,</i>
<i>this galaxy is called M31...</i>

12:35.756 --> 12:37.951
<i>... the great galaxy Andromeda.</i>

12:38.159 --> 12:41.754
<i>It's a vast storm of stars</i>
<i>and gas and dust.</i>

12:41.962 --> 12:43.259
<i>As we pass over it...</i>

12:43.464 --> 12:47.127
<i>... we see one of its small</i>
<i>satellite galaxies.</i>

12:50.971 --> 12:52.598
<i>Clusters of galaxies...</i>

12:52.807 --> 12:55.367
<i>... and the stars of</i>
<i>individual galaxies...</i>

12:55.576 --> 12:58.306
<i>... are all held together by gravity.</i>

12:58.512 --> 13:00.241
<i>Surrounding M31...</i>

13:00.448 --> 13:04.179
<i>... are hundreds of globular</i>
<i>star clusters.</i>

13:05.186 --> 13:07.381
<i>We're approaching one of them.</i>

13:07.788 --> 13:11.383
<i>Each cluster orbits the massive</i>
<i>center of the galaxy.</i>

13:11.592 --> 13:15.790
<i>Some contain up to</i>
<i>a million separate stars.</i>

13:16.230 --> 13:19.791
<i>Every globular cluster is</i>
<i>like a swarm of bees...</i>

13:20.000 --> 13:21.399
<i>... bound by gravity...</i>

13:21.602 --> 13:23.832
<i>... every bee, a sun.</i>

13:26.974 --> 13:29.465
<i>From Pegasus,</i>
<i>our voyage has taken us...</i>

13:29.677 --> 13:33.204
<i>... 200 million light years</i>
<i>to the Local Group...</i>

13:33.414 --> 13:37.680
<i>... dominated by two</i>
<i>great spiral galaxies.</i>

13:38.853 --> 13:42.687
<i>Beyond M31 is another</i>
<i>very similar galaxy.</i>

13:42.890 --> 13:45.324
<i>Its spiral arms slowly turning...</i>

13:45.526 --> 13:48.290
<i>... once every quarter billion years.</i>

13:54.602 --> 13:57.400
<i>This is our own Milky Way...</i>

13:57.605 --> 14:00.472
<i>... seen from the outside.</i>

14:06.747 --> 14:11.377
<i>This is the home galaxy</i>
<i>of the human species.</i>

14:18.893 --> 14:23.830
<i>In the obscure backwaters</i>
<i>of the Carina-Cygnus spiral arm...</i>

14:24.098 --> 14:27.363
<i>... we humans have evolved</i>
<i>to consciousness...</i>

14:27.568 --> 14:30.765
<i>... and some measure of understanding.</i>

14:38.946 --> 14:41.676
<i>Concentrated in its brilliant core...</i>

14:41.882 --> 14:44.612
<i>... and strewn along its spiral arms...</i>

14:44.818 --> 14:48.845
<i>... are 400 billion suns.</i>

14:51.225 --> 14:53.716
<i>It takes light 100,000 years</i>
<i>to travel...</i>

14:53.928 --> 14:56.897
<i>... from one end of the galaxy</i>
<i>to the other.</i>

14:58.933 --> 15:02.892
<i>Within this galaxy are</i>
<i>stars and worlds...</i>

15:03.103 --> 15:07.437
<i>... and, it may be, an enormous</i>
<i>diversity of living things...</i>

15:07.641 --> 15:12.578
<i>... and intelligent beings</i>
<i>and spacefaring civilizations.</i>

15:20.487 --> 15:23.285
<i>Scattered among the stars</i>
<i>of the Milky Way...</i>

15:23.490 --> 15:25.458
<i>... are supernova remnants...</i>

15:25.659 --> 15:29.925
<i>... each one the remains of</i>
<i>a colossal stellar explosion.</i>

15:30.197 --> 15:32.222
<i>These filaments of glowing gas...</i>

15:32.433 --> 15:36.460
<i>... are the outer layers of a star</i>
<i>which has recently destroyed itself.</i>

15:36.670 --> 15:38.399
<i>The gas is unraveling...</i>

15:38.606 --> 15:42.133
<i>... returning star-stuff</i>
<i>back into space.</i>

15:42.376 --> 15:45.311
(PULSAR HISSES)

15:46.347 --> 15:49.612
<i>And at its heart, are the remains</i>
<i>of the original star...</i>

15:49.817 --> 15:54.481
<i>... a dense, shrunken stellar</i>
<i>fragment called a pulsar.</i>

15:54.688 --> 15:57.987
<i>A natural lighthouse,</i>
<i>blinking and hissing.</i>

15:58.225 --> 16:01.717
<i>A sun that spins twice each second.</i>

16:07.568 --> 16:10.935
<i>Pulsars keep such perfect time</i>
<i>that the first one discovered...</i>

16:11.138 --> 16:14.039
<i>... was thought to be a sign of</i>
<i>extraterrestrial intelligence.</i>

16:14.241 --> 16:16.607
<i>Perhaps a navigational beacon...</i>

16:16.810 --> 16:19.745
<i>... for great ships that travel</i>
<i>across the light years...</i>

16:20.080 --> 16:22.105
<i>... and between the stars.</i>

16:25.753 --> 16:29.348
<i>There may be such intelligences</i>
<i>and such starships...</i>

16:29.556 --> 16:33.322
<i>... but pulsars are not</i>
<i>their signature.</i>

16:43.504 --> 16:46.905
<i>Instead, they are</i>
<i>the doleful reminders...</i>

16:47.107 --> 16:48.870
<i>... that nothing lasts forever...</i>

16:49.076 --> 16:51.772
<i>... that stars also die.</i>

16:54.415 --> 16:58.351
<i>We continue to plummet,</i>
<i>falling thousands of light years...</i>

16:58.552 --> 17:01.077
<i>... towards the plane of the galaxy.</i>

17:03.424 --> 17:05.051
<i>This is the Milky Way...</i>

17:05.259 --> 17:07.727
<i>... our galaxy seen edge on.</i>

17:07.928 --> 17:10.021
<i>Billions of nuclear furnaces...</i>

17:10.230 --> 17:13.290
<i>... converting matter into starlight.</i>

17:18.205 --> 17:21.106
<i>Some stars are flimsy</i>
<i>as a soap bubble.</i>

17:21.308 --> 17:25.677
<i>Others are 100 trillion times</i>
<i>denser than lead.</i>

17:25.879 --> 17:29.406
<i>The hottest stars are</i>
<i>destined to die young.</i>

17:29.850 --> 17:33.115
<i>But red giants are mostly elderly.</i>

17:33.320 --> 17:37.416
<i>Such stars are unlikely</i>
<i>to have inhabited planets.</i>

17:40.294 --> 17:42.990
<i>But yellow dwarf stars,</i>
<i>like the sun...</i>

17:43.197 --> 17:47.065
<i>... are middle-aged</i>
<i>and they are far more common.</i>

17:47.768 --> 17:50.703
<i>These stars may have</i>
<i>planetary systems.</i>

17:50.904 --> 17:54.499
<i>And on such planets, for the first</i>
<i>time on our cosmic voyage...</i>

17:54.708 --> 17:57.199
<i>... we encounter rare forms of matter:</i>

17:57.411 --> 18:02.007
<i>Ice and rock, air and liquid water.</i>

18:06.954 --> 18:08.581
<i>Close to this yellow star...</i>

18:08.822 --> 18:11.814
<i>... is a small, warm, cloudy world...</i>

18:12.025 --> 18:14.186
<i>... with continents and oceans.</i>

18:14.394 --> 18:19.331
<i>These conditions permit an even more</i>
<i>precious form of matter to arise:</i>

18:19.733 --> 18:21.030
<i>Life.</i>

18:28.242 --> 18:30.107
<i>But this is not the Earth.</i>

18:30.310 --> 18:34.974
<i>Intelligent beings have evolved</i>
<i>and reworked this planetary surface...</i>

18:35.182 --> 18:38.049
<i>... in a massive engineering</i>
<i>enterprise.</i>

18:38.252 --> 18:41.483
<i>In the Milky Way galaxy,</i>
<i>there may be many worlds...</i>

18:41.688 --> 18:45.124
<i>... on which matter has</i>
<i>grown to consciousness.</i>

18:52.399 --> 18:55.732
<i>I wonder, are they very</i>
<i>different from us?</i>

18:55.936 --> 18:57.369
<i>What do they look like?</i>

18:57.571 --> 19:01.667
<i>What are their politics, technology,</i>
<i>music, religion?</i>

19:02.176 --> 19:06.670
<i>Or do they have patterns of culture</i>
<i>we can't begin to imagine?</i>

19:06.880 --> 19:11.112
<i>Are they also a danger to themselves?</i>

19:18.025 --> 19:21.552
<i>Among the many glowing clouds</i>
<i>of interstellar gas...</i>

19:21.762 --> 19:24.754
<i>... is one called the Orion Nebula...</i>

19:24.998 --> 19:28.126
<i>... only 1500 light years from Earth.</i>

19:33.540 --> 19:36.941
<i>These three bright stars</i>
<i>are seen by earthlings...</i>

19:37.144 --> 19:41.945
<i>... as the belt in the familiar</i>
<i>constellation of Orion the hunter.</i>

19:48.355 --> 19:51.518
<i>The nebula appears from Earth</i>
<i>as a patch of light...</i>

19:51.725 --> 19:55.957
<i>... the middle star in Orion's sword.</i>

20:03.937 --> 20:06.405
<i>But it is not a star.</i>

20:06.607 --> 20:09.542
<i>It is another thing entirely.</i>

20:09.743 --> 20:14.510
<i>A cloud that veils</i>
<i>one of nature's secret places.</i>

20:23.557 --> 20:28.494
<i>This is a stellar nursery,</i>
<i>a place where stars are born.</i>

20:28.729 --> 20:31.493
<i>They condense by gravity</i>
<i>from gas and dust...</i>

20:31.698 --> 20:36.533
<i>... until their temperatures become</i>
<i>so high that they begin to shine.</i>

20:37.070 --> 20:39.800
<i>Such clouds mark</i>
<i>the births of stars...</i>

20:40.007 --> 20:42.840
<i>... as others bear witness</i>
<i>to their deaths.</i>

20:48.949 --> 20:53.181
<i>After stars condense in the hidden</i>
<i>interiors of interstellar clouds...</i>

20:53.387 --> 20:54.877
<i>... what happens to them?</i>

20:55.088 --> 20:58.615
<i>The Pleiades are a loose cluster</i>
<i>of young stars...</i>

20:58.825 --> 21:00.884
<i>... only 50 million years old.</i>

21:01.094 --> 21:06.031
<i>These fledgling stars are just</i>
<i>being let out into the galaxy.</i>

21:06.266 --> 21:09.463
<i>Still surrounded by wisps</i>
<i>of nebulosity...</i>

21:09.670 --> 21:13.197
<i>... the gas and dust</i>
<i>from which they formed.</i>

21:47.607 --> 21:50.974
<i>There are clouds</i>
<i>that hang like inkblots...</i>

21:51.178 --> 21:52.805
<i>... between the stars.</i>

21:53.013 --> 21:55.811
<i>They are made of fine, rocky dust...</i>

21:56.016 --> 21:58.416
<i>... organic matter and ice.</i>

22:00.120 --> 22:04.113
<i>Inside, a few stars begin to turn on.</i>

22:04.324 --> 22:06.224
<i>Nearby worlds of ice evaporate...</i>

22:06.426 --> 22:09.020
<i>... and form long, comet-like tails...</i>

22:09.229 --> 22:12.164
<i>... driven back by the stellar winds.</i>

22:17.104 --> 22:20.369
<i>Black clouds, light years across...</i>

22:20.574 --> 22:22.542
<i>... drift between the stars.</i>

22:22.743 --> 22:25.678
<i>They're filled with</i>
<i>organic molecules.</i>

22:25.879 --> 22:28.746
<i>The building blocks of life</i>
<i>are everywhere.</i>

22:28.949 --> 22:30.917
<i>They are easily made.</i>

22:31.118 --> 22:36.055
<i>On how many worlds have such complex</i>
<i>molecules assembled themselves...</i>

22:36.323 --> 22:39.986
<i>... into patterns we would</i>
<i>call alive?</i>

22:45.332 --> 22:50.201
<i>Most stars belong to systems</i>
<i>of two or three or many suns...</i>

22:50.404 --> 22:52.395
<i>... bound together by gravity.</i>

22:52.606 --> 22:55.837
<i>Each system is isolated</i>
<i>from its neighbors...</i>

22:56.043 --> 22:57.601
<i>... by the light years.</i>

22:59.913 --> 23:03.713
<i>We are approaching a single,</i>
<i>ordinary, yellow dwarf star...</i>

23:03.917 --> 23:06.613
<i>... surrounded by a system</i>
<i>of nine planets...</i>

23:06.820 --> 23:11.280
<i>... dozens of moons, thousands of</i>
<i>asteroids and billions of comets:</i>

23:11.525 --> 23:13.550
<i>The family of the sun.</i>

23:15.295 --> 23:19.561
<i>Only four light hours from Earth</i>
<i>is the planet Neptune...</i>

23:19.766 --> 23:22.530
<i>... and its giant satellite, Triton.</i>

23:26.273 --> 23:29.140
<i>Even in the outskirts</i>
<i>of our own solar system...</i>

23:29.342 --> 23:33.438
<i>... we humans have barely begun</i>
<i>our explorations.</i>

23:35.882 --> 23:37.281
<i>Only a century ago...</i>

23:37.484 --> 23:41.352
<i>... we were ignorant even of</i>
<i>the existence of the planet Pluto.</i>

23:41.555 --> 23:46.492
<i>Its moon, Charon, remained</i>
<i>undiscovered until 1978.</i>

23:51.465 --> 23:55.925
<i>The rings of Uranus were</i>
<i>first detected in 1977.</i>

23:56.136 --> 24:00.004
<i>There are new worlds to chart</i>
<i>even this close to home.</i>

24:03.443 --> 24:06.776
<i>Saturn is a giant gas world.</i>

24:06.980 --> 24:08.948
<i>If it has a solid surface...</i>

24:09.149 --> 24:12.949
<i>... it must lie far below</i>
<i>the clouds we see.</i>

24:14.588 --> 24:16.522
<i>Saturn's majestic rings...</i>

24:16.723 --> 24:19.988
<i>... are made of trillions</i>
<i>of orbiting snowballs.</i>

24:25.866 --> 24:29.893
<i>We are now only 80 light minutes</i>
<i>from home.</i>

24:30.103 --> 24:33.595
<i>A mere 11/2 billion kilometers.</i>

24:47.420 --> 24:51.288
<i>The largest planet in our</i>
<i>solar system is Jupiter.</i>

24:51.491 --> 24:55.825
<i>On its dark side, super bolts</i>
<i>of lightning illuminate the clouds...</i>

24:56.029 --> 25:00.864
<i>... as first revealed by</i>
<i>the</i> Voyager <i>spacecraft in 1979.</i>

25:13.079 --> 25:14.910
<i>Inside the orbit of Jupiter...</i>

25:15.115 --> 25:18.710
<i>... are countless shattered</i>
<i>and broken world-lets:</i>

25:18.919 --> 25:20.511
<i>The asteroids.</i>

25:20.720 --> 25:22.813
<i>These reefs and shoals...</i>

25:23.023 --> 25:26.186
<i>... mark the border of</i>
<i>the realm of giant planets.</i>

25:26.393 --> 25:30.796
<i>We are now entering the shallows</i>
<i>of the solar system.</i>

25:32.532 --> 25:36.866
<i>Here there are worlds with thin</i>
<i>atmospheres and solid surfaces:</i>

25:37.070 --> 25:38.401
<i>Earth-like planets...</i>

25:38.605 --> 25:42.632
<i>... with landscapes crying out</i>
<i>for careful exploration.</i>

25:42.842 --> 25:45.834
<i>This world is Mars.</i>

25:48.315 --> 25:51.807
<i>In 1976, after a year's voyage...</i>

25:52.018 --> 25:54.509
<i>... two robot explorers from Earth...</i>

25:54.721 --> 25:57.315
<i>... landed on this alien shore.</i>

25:59.192 --> 26:02.787
<i>On Mars, there is a volcano</i>
<i>as wide as Arizona...</i>

26:02.996 --> 26:05.760
<i>... and almost three times</i>
<i>the height of Mount Everest.</i>

26:05.966 --> 26:09.094
<i>We've named it Mount Olympus.</i>

26:13.807 --> 26:16.742
<i>This is a world of wonders.</i>

26:18.411 --> 26:21.039
<i>Mars is a planet with ancient</i>
<i>river valleys...</i>

26:21.248 --> 26:26.185
<i>... and violent sandstorms driven</i>
<i>by winds at half the speed of sound.</i>

26:33.393 --> 26:38.228
<i>There is a giant rift in its surface</i>
<i>5000 kilometers long.</i>

26:38.431 --> 26:41.889
<i>It's called Vallis Marinaris.</i>

26:42.102 --> 26:44.434
<i>The valley of</i>
<i>the</i> Mariner <i>spacecraft...</i>

26:44.638 --> 26:49.007
<i>... that came to explore Mars</i>
<i>from a nearby world.</i>

27:07.060 --> 27:10.325
<i>In this, our first cosmic voyage...</i>

27:10.530 --> 27:13.363
<i>... we have just begun</i>
<i>the reconnaissance of Mars...</i>

27:13.566 --> 27:17.024
<i>... and all those other planets</i>
<i>and stars and galaxies.</i>

27:17.237 --> 27:21.503
<i>In voyages to come,</i>
<i>we will explore them more fully.</i>

27:29.049 --> 27:32.712
<i>But now, we travel the few</i>
<i>remaining light minutes...</i>

27:32.919 --> 27:37.652
<i>... to a blue and cloudy world,</i>
<i>third from the sun.</i>

27:38.058 --> 27:40.117
<i>The end of our long journey...</i>

27:40.327 --> 27:42.727
<i>... is the world where we began.</i>

27:43.063 --> 27:44.894
<i>Our travels allow us...</i>

27:45.098 --> 27:47.362
<i>... to see the Earth anew...</i>

27:47.567 --> 27:50.627
<i>... as if we came from somewhere else.</i>

27:53.073 --> 27:55.701
<i>There are a hundred billion</i>
<i>galaxies...</i>

27:55.909 --> 27:58.901
<i>... and a billion trillion stars.</i>

27:59.112 --> 28:03.708
<i>Why should this modest planet</i>
<i>be the only inhabited world?</i>

28:03.917 --> 28:08.513
<i>To me, it seems far more likely</i>
<i>that the cosmos is brimming over...</i>

28:08.722 --> 28:10.849
<i>... with life and intelligence.</i>

28:11.057 --> 28:13.719
<i>But so far, every living thing...</i>

28:13.927 --> 28:15.519
<i>... every conscious being...</i>

28:15.729 --> 28:18.425
<i>... every civilization</i>
<i>we know anything about...</i>

28:18.631 --> 28:21.327
<i>... lived there, on Earth.</i>

28:28.575 --> 28:30.202
<i>Beneath these clouds...</i>

28:30.410 --> 28:34.039
<i>... the drama of the human species</i>
<i>has been unfolded.</i>

28:36.683 --> 28:39.914
<i>We have, at last, come home.</i>

28:49.629 --> 28:51.824
Welcome to the planet Earth.

28:52.165 --> 28:54.998
A place with blue nitrogen skies...

28:55.201 --> 28:57.101
...oceans of liquid water...

28:57.303 --> 28:58.634
...cool forests...

28:58.838 --> 29:00.237
...soft meadows.

29:00.440 --> 29:04.069
A world positively rippling with life.

29:04.611 --> 29:08.138
In the cosmic perspective,
it is, for the moment, unique.

29:08.348 --> 29:10.976
The only world in which
we know with certainty...

29:11.184 --> 29:15.177
...that the matter of the cosmos
has become alive and aware.

29:15.422 --> 29:18.255
There must be many such worlds
scattered through space...

29:18.458 --> 29:20.892
...but our search for them
begins here...

29:21.094 --> 29:24.495
...with the accumulated wisdom of
the men and women of our species...

29:24.697 --> 29:26.494
<i>... acquired at great cost...</i>

29:26.699 --> 29:28.826
<i>... over a million years.</i>

30:11.978 --> 30:14.879
<i>There was once a time when</i>
<i>our planet seemed immense.</i>

30:15.081 --> 30:17.572
<i>When it was the only world</i>
<i>we could explore.</i>

30:17.784 --> 30:22.016
<i>Its true size was first worked out</i>
<i>in a simple and ingenious way...</i>

30:22.222 --> 30:26.488
<i>... by a man who lived here in Egypt,</i>
<i>in the third century B.C.</i>

30:32.432 --> 30:36.698
This tower may have been
a communications tower.

30:36.903 --> 30:40.669
Part of a network running along
the North African coast...

30:40.874 --> 30:45.277
...by which signal bonfires were used
to communicate messages of state.

30:45.478 --> 30:49.881
It also may have been used
as a lighthouse...

30:50.083 --> 30:53.348
...a navigational beacon
for sailing ships...

30:53.553 --> 30:55.885
...out there in the Mediterranean Sea.

30:56.089 --> 30:58.614
It is about 50 kilometers west...

30:58.825 --> 31:03.489
...of what was once one of the great
cities of the world, Alexandria.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.455
In Alexandria, at that time...

31:06.666 --> 31:09.692
...there lived a man named
Eratosthenes.

31:09.903 --> 31:14.397
A competitor called him "beta," the
second letter of the Greek alphabet...

31:14.607 --> 31:19.306
...because, he said, "Eratosthenes
was second best in everything."

31:19.512 --> 31:24.245
But it seems clear, in many fields,
Eratosthenes was "alpha."

31:24.450 --> 31:28.113
He was an astronomer, historian,
geographer...

31:28.354 --> 31:32.222
...philosopher, poet, theater critic
and mathematician.

31:32.425 --> 31:36.828
He was also the chief librarian
of the Great Library of Alexandria.

31:37.030 --> 31:41.967
And one day while reading
a papyrus book in the library...

31:42.168 --> 31:46.104
...he came upon a curious account.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.177
<i>Far to the south, he read...</i>

31:55.381 --> 31:57.713
<i>... at the frontier outpost of Syene...</i>

31:57.917 --> 32:01.409
<i>... something notable could be seen</i>
<i>on the longest day of the year.</i>

32:06.392 --> 32:07.916
<i>On June 21st...</i>

32:08.127 --> 32:11.187
<i>... the shadows of a temple column,</i>
<i>or a vertical stick...</i>

32:11.397 --> 32:13.991
<i>... would grow shorter</i>
<i>as noon approached.</i>

32:19.939 --> 32:21.566
<i>As the hours crept towards midday...</i>

32:21.774 --> 32:26.006
<i>... the sun's rays would slither down</i>
<i>the sides of a deep well...</i>

32:26.212 --> 32:28.703
<i>... which on other days</i>
<i>would remain in shadow.</i>

32:35.655 --> 32:38.283
<i>And then, precisely at noon...</i>

32:38.491 --> 32:40.891
<i>... columns would cast no shadows.</i>

32:41.094 --> 32:45.622
<i>And the sun would shine directly down</i>
<i>into the water of the well.</i>

32:51.771 --> 32:53.204
<i>At that moment...</i>

32:53.406 --> 32:55.931
<i>... the sun was exactly overhead.</i>

33:01.147 --> 33:05.481
It was an observation that someone else
might easily have ignored.

33:05.685 --> 33:09.553
Sticks, shadows,
reflections in wells...

33:09.756 --> 33:11.485
...the position of the sun...

33:11.691 --> 33:13.716
...simple, everyday matters.

33:13.926 --> 33:16.986
Of what possible importance
might they be?

33:17.363 --> 33:20.059
But Eratosthenes was a scientist...

33:20.266 --> 33:23.724
...and his contemplation of these
homely matters changed the world...

33:23.936 --> 33:26.200
...in a way, made the world.

33:26.406 --> 33:30.536
Because Eratosthenes had
the presence of mind to experiment...

33:30.743 --> 33:35.203
...to actually ask whether
back here, near Alexandria...

33:35.415 --> 33:40.352
...a stick cast a shadow
near noon on June the 21 st.

33:40.720 --> 33:43.518
And it turns out, sticks do.

33:45.792 --> 33:48.226
An overly skeptical person
might have said...

33:48.428 --> 33:51.090
...that the report from Syene
was an error.

33:51.297 --> 33:54.095
But it's an absolutely
straightforward observation.

33:54.300 --> 33:57.463
Why would anyone lie
on such a trivial matter?

33:57.670 --> 34:00.400
Eratosthenes asked himself
how it could be...

34:00.606 --> 34:02.631
...that at the same moment...

34:02.842 --> 34:05.504
...a stick in Syene
would cast no shadow...

34:05.712 --> 34:09.273
...and a stick in Alexandria,
800 kilometers to the north...

34:09.482 --> 34:12.042
...would cast a very definite shadow.

34:15.121 --> 34:18.386
Here is a map of ancient Egypt.

34:19.225 --> 34:22.592
I've inserted two sticks, or obelisks.

34:22.795 --> 34:27.255
One up here in Alexandria
and one down here in Syene.

34:27.467 --> 34:31.301
Now, if at a certain moment
each stick casts...

34:31.504 --> 34:33.904
...no shadow, no shadow at all...

34:34.273 --> 34:38.539
...that's perfectly easy to understand,
provided the Earth is flat.

34:38.745 --> 34:41.942
If the shadow at Syene is
at a certain length...

34:42.148 --> 34:44.582
...and the shadow at Alexandria is
the same length...

34:44.784 --> 34:47.344
...that also makes sense
on a flat Earth.

34:47.820 --> 34:51.051
But how could it be,
Eratosthenes asked...

34:51.257 --> 34:55.751
...that at the same instant
there was no shadow at Syene...

34:56.095 --> 35:00.759
...and a very substantial shadow
at Alexandria?

35:02.101 --> 35:06.663
The only answer was that
the surface of the Earth is curved.

35:06.906 --> 35:08.237
Not only that...

35:08.441 --> 35:12.241
...but the greater the curvature,
the bigger the difference...

35:12.445 --> 35:16.142
...in the lengths of the shadows.
The sun is so far away...

35:16.349 --> 35:18.783
...that its rays are parallel
when they reach the Earth.

35:18.985 --> 35:23.251
Sticks at different angles to the sun
will cast shadows at different lengths.

35:23.456 --> 35:26.892
For the observed difference
in the shadow lengths...

35:27.093 --> 35:29.527
...the distance between
Alexandria and Syene...

35:29.729 --> 35:33.631
...had to be about seven degrees
along the surface of the Earth.

35:33.833 --> 35:37.735
By that, I mean, if you would imagine
these sticks extending...

35:37.937 --> 35:40.371
...all the way down
to the center of the Earth...

35:40.640 --> 35:43.734
...they would there intersect
at an angle of seven degrees.

35:43.943 --> 35:47.106
Well, seven degrees is
something like a 50th...

35:47.313 --> 35:50.874
...of the full circumference
of the Earth, 360 degrees.

35:51.083 --> 35:55.611
Eratosthenes knew the distance
between Alexandria and Syene.

35:55.822 --> 35:57.790
He knew it was 800 kilometers.

35:57.990 --> 36:02.586
Why? Because he hired a man
to pace out the entire distance...

36:02.795 --> 36:06.253
...so that he could perform
the calculation I'm talking about.

36:06.465 --> 36:11.198
Now, 800 kilometers times 50
is 40,000 kilometers.

36:11.404 --> 36:13.497
That must be the circumference
of the Earth.

36:13.706 --> 36:16.903
That's how far it is to go
once around the Earth.

36:17.376 --> 36:18.843
That's the right answer.

36:19.045 --> 36:21.377
Eratosthenes' only tools were...

36:21.581 --> 36:25.449
...sticks, eyes, feet and brains.

36:25.985 --> 36:29.011
Plus a zest for experiment.

36:29.722 --> 36:33.453
With those tools, he correctly deduced
the circumference of the Earth...

36:33.659 --> 36:38.119
...to high precision with an error
of only a few percent.

36:39.232 --> 36:44.169
That's pretty good figuring
for 2200 years ago.

36:54.513 --> 36:58.244
<i>Then, as now, the Mediterranean was</i>
<i>teeming with ships.</i>

36:58.451 --> 37:02.547
<i>Merchantmen, fishing vessels,</i>
<i>naval flotillas.</i>

37:02.755 --> 37:07.124
<i>But there were also</i>
<i>courageous voyages into the unknown.</i>

37:08.527 --> 37:13.157
<i>400 years before Eratosthenes,</i>
<i>Africa was circumnavigated...</i>

37:13.366 --> 37:16.301
<i>... by a Phoenician fleet</i>
<i>in the employ...</i>

37:16.502 --> 37:18.561
<i>... of the Egyptian pharaoh Necho.</i>

37:18.771 --> 37:19.965
They set sail...

37:20.172 --> 37:24.700
...probably in boats as frail
and open as these...

37:24.911 --> 37:28.108
...out from the Red Sea,
down the east coast of Africa...

37:28.314 --> 37:31.579
...up into the Atlantic and then
back through the Mediterranean.

37:31.984 --> 37:34.680
That epic journey took three years...

37:34.887 --> 37:37.014
...about as long as
it takes <i>Voyager...</i>

37:37.223 --> 37:40.215
...to journey from Earth to Saturn.

37:40.793 --> 37:43.421
After Eratosthenes,
some may have attempted...

37:43.629 --> 37:45.995
...to circumnavigate the Earth.

37:46.198 --> 37:49.099
But until the time of Magellan,
no one succeeded.

37:49.702 --> 37:52.694
What tales of adventure and daring...

37:52.905 --> 37:55.032
...must earlier have been told...

37:55.241 --> 37:59.575
...as sailors and navigators,
practical men of the world...

37:59.779 --> 38:02.646
...gambled their lives
on the mathematics...

38:02.848 --> 38:06.284
...of a scientist
from ancient Alexandria.

38:12.892 --> 38:16.555
<i>Today, Alexandria shows few traces</i>
<i>of its ancient glory...</i>

38:16.762 --> 38:20.095
<i>... of the days when Eratosthenes</i>
<i>walked its broad avenues.</i>

38:20.299 --> 38:24.963
<i>Over the centuries, waves of conquerors</i>
<i>converted its palaces and temples...</i>

38:25.171 --> 38:29.938
<i>... into castles and churches,</i>
<i>then into minarets and mosques.</i>

38:31.277 --> 38:35.680
<i>The city was chosen to be the capital</i>
<i>of his empire by Alexander the Great...</i>

38:35.881 --> 38:39.840
<i>... on a winter's afternoon in 331 B.C.</i>

38:40.386 --> 38:43.719
<i>A century later, it had become</i>
<i>the greatest city of the world.</i>

38:43.923 --> 38:47.654
<i>Each successive civilization</i>
<i>has left its mark.</i>

38:53.599 --> 38:58.059
<i>But what now remains of the</i>
<i>marvel city of Alexander's dream?</i>

38:59.538 --> 39:02.439
<i>Alexandria is still</i>
<i>a thriving marketplace...</i>

39:02.641 --> 39:05.906
<i>... still a crossroads</i>
<i>for the peoples of the Near East.</i>

39:12.385 --> 39:15.548
<i>But once, it was radiant</i>
<i>with self-confidence...</i>

39:15.755 --> 39:18.019
<i>... certain of its power.</i>

39:24.597 --> 39:26.690
<i>Can you recapture a vanished epoch...</i>

39:26.899 --> 39:31.268
<i>... from a few broken statues and scraps</i>
<i>of ancient manuscripts?</i>

39:38.944 --> 39:42.471
In Alexandria, there was
an immense library...

39:42.681 --> 39:45.309
...and an associated
research institute.

39:45.518 --> 39:49.648
And in them worked the finest minds
in the ancient world.

39:53.292 --> 39:55.317
(CAN CLUNKS)

39:55.528 --> 39:57.928
(DOOR SQUEAKS)

40:10.242 --> 40:12.676
Of that legendary library...

40:12.878 --> 40:15.438
...all that survives is this...

40:15.648 --> 40:18.344
...dank and forgotten cellar.

40:19.285 --> 40:23.221
It's in the library annex,
the Serapeum...

40:23.422 --> 40:25.390
...which was once a temple...

40:25.591 --> 40:28.389
...but was later reconsecrated
to knowledge.

40:28.928 --> 40:32.625
These few moldering shelves...

40:33.032 --> 40:35.466
...probably once in a basement
storage room...

40:35.668 --> 40:38.364
...are its only physical remains.

40:38.737 --> 40:41.501
But this place was once...

40:41.807 --> 40:44.674
...the brain and glory...

40:44.877 --> 40:48.005
...of the greatest city
on the planet Earth.

40:56.021 --> 40:58.615
<i>If I could travel back into time...</i>

40:58.824 --> 41:01.349
<i>... this is the place I would visit.</i>

41:02.261 --> 41:06.755
<i>The Library of Alexandria</i>
<i>at its height, 2000 years ago.</i>

41:10.836 --> 41:13.270
<i>Here, in an important sense...</i>

41:13.472 --> 41:17.772
<i>... began the intellectual adventure</i>
<i>which has led us into space.</i>

41:24.383 --> 41:29.320
<i>All the knowledge in the ancient world</i>
<i>was once within these marble walls.</i>

41:35.427 --> 41:38.885
<i>In the great hall, there may have</i>
<i>been a mural of Alexander...</i>

41:39.098 --> 41:42.329
<i>... with the crook and flail</i>
<i>and ceremonial headdress...</i>

41:42.535 --> 41:45.163
<i>... of the pharaohs of ancient Egypt.</i>

41:48.774 --> 41:52.266
<i>This library was a citadel</i>
<i>of human consciousness...</i>

41:52.478 --> 41:56.574
<i>... a beacon on our journey</i>
<i>to the stars.</i>

41:59.919 --> 42:04.788
It was the first true research
institute in the history of the world.

42:05.057 --> 42:06.991
And what did they study?

42:07.293 --> 42:11.229
They studied everything.
The entire cosmos.

42:11.430 --> 42:15.833
"Cosmos" is a Greek word
for the order of the universe.

42:16.035 --> 42:19.129
In a way, it's the opposite of chaos.

42:19.371 --> 42:24.274
It implies a deep interconnectedness
of all things.

42:24.710 --> 42:29.647
The intricate and subtle way
that the universe is put together.

42:31.083 --> 42:33.779
Genius flourished here.

42:33.986 --> 42:38.320
In addition to Eratosthenes,
there was the astronomer Hipparchus...

42:38.524 --> 42:40.287
...who mapped the constellation...

42:40.492 --> 42:43.518
...and established the brightness
of the stars.

42:44.196 --> 42:46.255
And there was Euclid...

42:46.465 --> 42:49.298
...who brilliantly
systematized geometry...

42:49.501 --> 42:51.867
...who told his king,
who was struggling...

42:52.071 --> 42:54.699
...with some difficult problem
in mathematics...

42:54.907 --> 42:59.276
...that there was no royal road
to geometry.

42:59.812 --> 43:02.508
There was Dionysius of Thrace,
the man who defined...

43:02.715 --> 43:06.173
...the parts of speech:
nouns, verbs and so on...

43:06.385 --> 43:10.321
...who did for language, in a way,
what Euclid did for geometry.

43:10.522 --> 43:14.549
There was Herophilus,
a physiologist who identified...

43:14.760 --> 43:18.287
...the brain rather than the heart
as the seat of intelligence.

43:18.964 --> 43:21.660
There was Archimedes,
the greatest mechanical genius...

43:21.867 --> 43:24.062
...until the time
of Leonardo da Vinci.

43:24.270 --> 43:29.003
And there was the astronomer Ptolemy,
who compiled much of what today is...

43:29.208 --> 43:31.472
...the pseudoscience of astrology.

43:31.677 --> 43:34.009
His Earth-centered universe...

43:34.213 --> 43:36.875
...held sway for 1500 years...

43:37.082 --> 43:40.518
...showing that intellectual brilliance
is no guarantee...

43:40.719 --> 43:42.812
...against being dead wrong.

43:43.289 --> 43:47.282
And among these great men,
there was also a great woman.

43:47.493 --> 43:49.688
Her name was Hypatia.

43:49.895 --> 43:52.762
She was a mathematician
and an astronomer...

43:52.965 --> 43:54.956
...the last light of the library...

43:55.167 --> 44:00.070
...whose martyrdom is bound up with
the destruction of this place...

44:00.272 --> 44:03.571
...seven centuries after
it was founded.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.224
Look at this place.

44:25.431 --> 44:28.332
The Greek kings of Egypt
who succeeded Alexander...

44:28.534 --> 44:31.867
...regarded advances in science,
literature and medicine...

44:32.071 --> 44:34.335
...as among the treasures
of the empire.

44:34.540 --> 44:39.000
For centuries, they generously
supported research and scholarship.

44:39.211 --> 44:43.614
An enlightenment shared by
few heads of state, then or now.

44:46.452 --> 44:49.387
(FOUNTAIN GURGLES)

44:53.092 --> 44:57.051
Off this great hall were
10 large research laboratories.

44:57.262 --> 45:01.392
There were fountains and colonnades,
botanical gardens...

45:01.600 --> 45:05.969
...and even a zoo with animals
from India and sub-Saharan Africa.

45:06.171 --> 45:10.870
There were dissecting rooms
and an astronomical observatory.

45:12.878 --> 45:14.709
But the treasure of the library...

45:14.913 --> 45:18.178
...consecrated to the god Serapis...

45:18.384 --> 45:21.182
...built in the city of Alexander...

45:21.387 --> 45:23.218
...was its collection of books.

45:23.422 --> 45:25.617
The organizers of the library combed...

45:25.824 --> 45:29.055
...all the cultures and languages
of the world for books.

45:29.261 --> 45:32.628
They sent agents abroad
to buy up libraries.

45:32.831 --> 45:37.768
Commercial ships docking in Alexandria
harbor were searched by the police...

45:38.003 --> 45:40.437
...not for contraband, but for books.

45:40.639 --> 45:44.200
The scrolls were borrowed, copied
and returned to their owners.

45:44.410 --> 45:48.471
Until studied, these scrolls were
collected in great stacks...

45:48.680 --> 45:51.945
...called, "books from the ships."

45:52.251 --> 45:54.685
Accurate numbers are
difficult to come by...

45:54.887 --> 45:57.879
...but it seems that the library
contained at its peak...

45:58.090 --> 46:01.184
...nearly one million scrolls.

46:14.740 --> 46:18.176
The papyrus reed grows in Egypt.

46:18.377 --> 46:20.572
It's the origin of our word
for "paper."

46:20.779 --> 46:24.545
Each of those million volumes
which once existed in this library...

46:24.750 --> 46:29.187
...were handwritten
on papyrus manuscript scrolls.

46:30.155 --> 46:32.020
What happened to all those books?

46:32.224 --> 46:35.660
The classical civilization
that created them disintegrated.

46:35.861 --> 46:38.352
The library itself was destroyed.

46:38.564 --> 46:41.727
Only a small fraction
of the works survived.

46:41.934 --> 46:45.062
And as for the rest,
we're left only with pathetic...

46:45.270 --> 46:47.431
...scattered fragments.

46:47.773 --> 46:52.039
But how tantalizing those remaining
bits and pieces are.

46:52.244 --> 46:55.907
For example, we know
that there once existed here...

46:56.114 --> 47:00.448
...a book by the astronomer
Aristarchus of Samos...

47:00.652 --> 47:04.782
...who apparently argued that
the Earth was one of the planets...

47:04.990 --> 47:08.482
...that, like the other planets,
it orbits the sun...

47:08.694 --> 47:13.063
...and that the stars are
enormously far away.

47:13.432 --> 47:15.900
All absolutely correct.

47:16.101 --> 47:18.729
But we had to wait
nearly 2000 years...

47:18.937 --> 47:22.100
...for these facts to be rediscovered.

47:29.181 --> 47:32.981
The astronomy stacks
of the Alexandria Library.

47:33.785 --> 47:35.685
Hipparchus.

47:36.054 --> 47:38.682
Ptolomeus. Here we are.

47:40.058 --> 47:42.891
Aristarchus.

47:43.962 --> 47:45.429
This is the book.

47:45.631 --> 47:48.862
How I'd love to be able
to read this book...

47:49.201 --> 47:52.170
...to know how Aristarchus
figured it out.

47:52.371 --> 47:55.738
But it's gone. Utterly and forever.

47:56.208 --> 48:00.577
If we multiply our sense of loss
for this work of Aristarchus...

48:00.779 --> 48:02.178
...by 100,000...

48:02.381 --> 48:04.849
...we begin to appreciate
the grandeur...

48:05.050 --> 48:07.712
...of the achievement
of classical civilization...

48:08.120 --> 48:10.987
...and the tragedy of its destruction.

48:14.493 --> 48:19.021
We have far surpassed the science
known to the ancient world...

48:19.231 --> 48:22.826
...but there are irreparable gaps
in our historical knowledge.

48:23.068 --> 48:26.435
Imagine what mysteries of the past
could be solved...

48:26.638 --> 48:29.072
...with a borrower's card
to this library.

48:29.274 --> 48:33.506
For example, we know of a three-volume
history of the world...

48:33.712 --> 48:38.206
...now lost, written by
a Babylonian priest named Berossus.

48:38.417 --> 48:42.046
Volume I dealt with the interval
from the creation of the world...

48:42.254 --> 48:43.414
...to the Great Flood.

48:43.622 --> 48:47.683
A period that he took
to be 432,000 years...

48:47.893 --> 48:51.624
...or about 100 times longer than
the Old Testament chronology.

48:51.830 --> 48:55.732
What wonders were in
the books of Berossus!

48:56.835 --> 49:00.862
But why have I brought you
across 2000 years...

49:01.073 --> 49:03.303
...to the Library of Alexandria?

49:04.076 --> 49:07.375
Because this was when and where
we humans...

49:07.579 --> 49:11.675
...first collected
seriously and systematically...

49:11.883 --> 49:13.817
...the knowledge of the world.

49:14.119 --> 49:16.610
This is the Earth
as Eratosthenes knew it.

49:16.822 --> 49:20.087
A tiny, spherical world, afloat...

49:20.292 --> 49:23.284
...in an immensity of space and time.

49:23.762 --> 49:26.458
We were, at long last,
beginning to find...

49:26.665 --> 49:29.600
...our true bearings in the cosmos.

49:30.369 --> 49:32.234
The scientists of antiquity...

49:32.437 --> 49:36.032
...took the first and most
important steps in that direction...

49:36.241 --> 49:39.005
...before their civilization
fell apart.

49:39.311 --> 49:42.178
But after the Dark Ages,
it was by and large...

49:42.381 --> 49:46.317
...the rediscovery of the works
of these scholars done here...

49:46.518 --> 49:48.713
...that made
the Renaissance possible...

49:48.920 --> 49:51.980
...and thereby powerfully influenced
our own culture.

49:52.190 --> 49:55.421
When, in the 15th century,
Europe was at last ready...

49:55.627 --> 49:58.425
...to awaken from its long sleep...

49:58.630 --> 50:02.896
...it picked up some of the tools,
the books and the concepts...

50:03.101 --> 50:07.128
...laid down here more than
a thousand years before.

50:12.577 --> 50:16.479
<i>By 1600, the long-forgotten ideas</i>
<i>of Aristarchus...</i>

50:16.682 --> 50:17.910
<i>... had been rediscovered.</i>

50:18.984 --> 50:22.249
<i>Johannes Kepler constructed</i>
<i>elaborate models...</i>

50:22.454 --> 50:25.355
<i>... to understand the motion</i>
<i>and arrangement of the planets...</i>

50:25.557 --> 50:28.219
<i>... the clockwork of the heavens.</i>

50:32.330 --> 50:36.164
<i>And at night, he dreamt</i>
<i>of traveling to the moon.</i>

50:46.878 --> 50:49.073
<i>His principal</i>
<i>scientific tools were...</i>

50:49.281 --> 50:52.079
<i>... the mathematics</i>
<i>of the Alexandrian Library...</i>

50:52.284 --> 50:54.718
<i>... and an unswerving respect</i>
<i>for the facts...</i>

50:54.920 --> 50:58.356
<i>... however disquieting they might be.</i>

51:01.760 --> 51:05.196
<i>His story, and the story of</i>
<i>the scientists who came after him...</i>

51:05.397 --> 51:07.831
<i>... are also part of our voyage.</i>

51:10.202 --> 51:13.171
<i>Seventy years later,</i>
<i>the sun-centered universe...</i>

51:13.371 --> 51:14.963
<i>... of Aristarchus and Copernicus...</i>

51:15.173 --> 51:19.041
<i>... was widely accepted</i>
<i>in the Europe of the Enlightenment.</i>

51:19.244 --> 51:22.680
<i>The idea arose that the planets</i>
<i>were worlds...</i>

51:22.881 --> 51:24.508
<i>... governed by laws of nature...</i>

51:24.716 --> 51:28.948
<i>... and scientific speculation turned</i>
<i>to the motions of the stars.</i>

51:29.154 --> 51:31.782
<i>The clockwork in the heavens</i>
<i>was imitated...</i>

51:31.990 --> 51:33.753
<i>... by the watchmakers of Earth.</i>

51:34.359 --> 51:37.851
<i>Precise timekeeping permitted</i>
<i>great sailing ship voyages...</i>

51:38.063 --> 51:40.588
<i>... of exploration and discovery...</i>

51:40.799 --> 51:42.357
<i>... which bound up the Earth.</i>

51:44.803 --> 51:47.135
<i>This was a time when free inquiry...</i>

51:47.339 --> 51:49.307
<i>... was valued once again.</i>

51:49.508 --> 51:53.774
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

51:56.214 --> 51:59.615
<i>250 years later,</i>
<i>the Earth was all explored.</i>

51:59.818 --> 52:02.981
<i>New adventurers now looked to</i>
<i>the planets and the stars.</i>

52:03.722 --> 52:07.385
<i>The galaxies were recognized</i>
<i>as great aggregates of stars...</i>

52:07.592 --> 52:11.528
<i>... island universes</i>
<i>millions of light years away.</i>

52:12.430 --> 52:15.558
<i>In the 1920s, astronomers had</i>
<i>begun to measure...</i>

52:15.767 --> 52:18.497
<i>... the speeds of distant galaxies.</i>

52:23.275 --> 52:24.242
ASTRONOMER 1:
What time is it?

52:24.442 --> 52:26.137
7:15.

52:26.578 --> 52:27.738
ASTRONOMER 1:
Lights off, please.

52:28.713 --> 52:33.343
<i>They found that the galaxies were</i>
<i>flying away from one another.</i>

52:33.552 --> 52:35.452
<i>To the astonishment of everyone...</i>

52:35.654 --> 52:38.885
<i>... the entire universe was expanding.</i>

52:44.696 --> 52:49.497
<i>We had begun to plumb the true depths</i>
<i>of time and space.</i>

52:51.937 --> 52:54.633
<i>The long, collective enterprise</i>
<i>of science...</i>

52:54.840 --> 52:59.140
<i>... has revealed a universe</i>
<i>some 15 billion years old.</i>

52:59.344 --> 53:02.336
<i>The time since the explosive</i>
<i>birth of the cosmos...</i>

53:02.547 --> 53:03.844
<i>... the big bang.</i>

53:04.149 --> 53:06.310
(THUNDER CRASHES)

53:10.288 --> 53:14.315
<i>The cosmic calendar compresses</i>
<i>the local history of the universe...</i>

53:14.526 --> 53:16.255
<i>... into a single year.</i>

53:16.461 --> 53:19.021
<i>If the universe began</i>
<i>on January 1st...</i>

53:19.231 --> 53:22.598
<i>... it was not until May</i>
<i>that the Milky Way formed.</i>

53:23.368 --> 53:26.132
<i>Other planetary systems</i>
<i>may have appeared...</i>

53:26.338 --> 53:29.136
<i>... in June, July and August...</i>

53:29.507 --> 53:32.237
<i>... but our sun and Earth,</i>
<i>not until mid-September.</i>

53:32.444 --> 53:34.810
<i>Life arose soon after.</i>

53:35.680 --> 53:39.741
<i>Everything humans have ever done</i>
<i>occurred in that bright speck...</i>

53:39.951 --> 53:43.011
<i>... at the lower right</i>
<i>of the cosmic calendar.</i>

53:45.657 --> 53:47.648
<i>The big bang is at upper left...</i>

53:47.859 --> 53:50.555
<i>... in the first second of January 1st.</i>

53:50.829 --> 53:54.526
<i>Fifteen billion years later</i>
<i>is our present time...</i>

53:54.733 --> 53:58.100
<i>... the last second of December 31st.</i>

54:03.074 --> 54:06.305
Every month is
11/4 billion years long.

54:06.511 --> 54:09.412
Each day represents 40 million years.

54:09.614 --> 54:13.345
Each second stands for some 500 years
of our history.

54:13.551 --> 54:17.783
The blinking of an eye
in the drama of cosmic time.

54:23.161 --> 54:27.621
At this scale, the cosmic calendar
is the size of a football field...

54:27.832 --> 54:30.995
...but all of human history
would occupy an area...

54:31.202 --> 54:32.829
...the size of my hand.

54:33.038 --> 54:36.496
We're just beginning to trace
the long and tortuous path...

54:36.708 --> 54:39.438
...which began with
the primeval fireball...

54:39.644 --> 54:42.340
...and led to the condensation
of matter:

54:42.547 --> 54:45.175
Gas, dust, stars, galaxies, and...

54:45.383 --> 54:47.749
...at least in our little nook
of the universe...

54:47.953 --> 54:52.253
...planets, life, intelligence
and inquisitive men and women.

54:52.457 --> 54:54.049
We've emerged so recently...

54:54.259 --> 54:57.126
...that the familiar events
of our recorded history...

54:57.329 --> 55:01.561
...occupy only the last seconds
of the last minute of December 31 st.

55:01.766 --> 55:05.395
But some critical events for the
human species began much earlier...

55:05.603 --> 55:07.366
...minutes earlier.

55:08.640 --> 55:12.041
<i>So we change our scale</i>
<i>from months to minutes.</i>

55:12.243 --> 55:15.406
<i>Down here, the first humans</i>
<i>made their debut...</i>

55:15.613 --> 55:19.105
<i>... around 10:30 p.m. on December 31st.</i>

55:21.987 --> 55:24.319
<i>And with the passing</i>
<i>of every cosmic minute...</i>

55:24.522 --> 55:26.581
<i>... each minute 30,000 years long...</i>

55:26.791 --> 55:29.123
<i>... we began the arduous journey</i>
<i>towards understanding...</i>

55:29.327 --> 55:31.989
<i>... where we live and who we are.</i>

55:34.833 --> 55:36.926
11:46...

55:37.135 --> 55:39.695
...only 14 minutes ago...

55:39.971 --> 55:42.940
...humans have tamed fire.

55:43.675 --> 55:48.476
11:59:20, the evening
of the last day of the cosmic year...

55:48.680 --> 55:52.514
...the 11 th hour, the 59th minute,
the 20th second...

55:52.717 --> 55:55.584
...the domestication of
plants and animals begins:

55:55.787 --> 55:58.688
An application of the human talent...

56:01.559 --> 56:03.288
...for making tools.

56:10.502 --> 56:14.996
11:59:35, settled agricultural
communities...

56:15.206 --> 56:17.936
...evolved into the first cities.

56:18.877 --> 56:22.973
We humans appear on
the comic calendar so recently...

56:23.181 --> 56:25.581
...that our recorded history
occupies only...

56:25.784 --> 56:30.721
...the last few seconds of
the last minute of December 31 st.

56:31.456 --> 56:36.223
In the vast ocean of time
which this calendar represents...

56:36.428 --> 56:39.795
...all our memories are confined...

56:41.966 --> 56:44.196
...to this small square.

56:44.569 --> 56:49.438
Every person we've ever heard of
lived somewhere in there.

56:49.874 --> 56:54.811
All those kings and battles, migrations
and inventions, wars and loves.

56:55.246 --> 56:57.009
Everything in the history books...

56:57.215 --> 56:59.149
...happens here...

57:00.018 --> 57:03.249
...in the last 10 seconds
of the cosmic calendar.

57:08.693 --> 57:11.184
<i>We on Earth have just awakened...</i>

57:11.396 --> 57:14.194
<i>... to the great oceans</i>
<i>of space and time...</i>

57:14.399 --> 57:16.367
<i>... from which we have emerged.</i>

57:17.669 --> 57:19.227
<i>We are the legacy...</i>

57:19.437 --> 57:22.929
<i>... of 15 billion years</i>
<i>of cosmic evolution.</i>

57:23.575 --> 57:25.270
<i>We have a choice:</i>

57:25.577 --> 57:29.069
<i>We can enhance life and come to know</i>
<i>the universe that made us...</i>

57:29.280 --> 57:32.511
<i>... or we can squander</i>
<i>our 15 billion-year heritage...</i>

57:32.717 --> 57:35.652
<i>... in meaningless self-destruction.</i>

57:36.888 --> 57:40.085
<i>What happens in the first second</i>
<i>of the next cosmic year...</i>

57:40.291 --> 57:43.454
<i>... depends on what we do,</i>
<i>here and now...</i>

57:43.661 --> 57:45.458
<i>... with our intelligence...</i>

57:45.663 --> 57:48.689
<i>... and our knowledge of the cosmos.</i>
