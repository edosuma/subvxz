WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:03.220
- Previously
on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:03.264 --> 00:05.005
- Some of the most evil souls
in all of history

00:05.048 --> 00:08.095
have been raised from hell.
- Nate, Zari. Zari, Nate.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.400
- Your sister
is the secret woman

00:09.444 --> 00:10.836
from the hologram message.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.751
- I know Behrad's
been lying to my parents.

00:12.795 --> 00:14.101
I know who you are.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.798
It's time they
finally heard the truth.

00:17.539 --> 00:20.498
- Guys, meet Zari.
She's my sister.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.022
- Help!

00:28.506 --> 00:30.073
- Freddy Meyers,

00:30.117 --> 00:32.206
you stand convicted
of seven counts of murder,

00:32.249 --> 00:35.339
all occurring
on June 2, 1989.

00:35.383 --> 00:38.168
You have been sentenced to
death by a jury of your peers.

00:38.212 --> 00:40.562
The state will now proceed
with your sentence.

00:40.605 --> 00:41.998
Do you have anything to say

00:42.042 --> 00:45.349
before your sentence
is carried out?

00:45.393 --> 00:47.090
- Only...

00:50.398 --> 00:52.878
That I love my mother.

01:08.155 --> 01:13.116
Freddy, Freddy!

01:13.160 --> 01:15.379
They took my Freddy!

01:15.423 --> 01:18.904
- ♪ Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth? ♪

01:18.948 --> 01:22.821
- ♪ Mmm, heaven
is a place on earth ♪

01:22.865 --> 01:26.521
♪ They say in heaven,
love comes first ♪

01:26.564 --> 01:30.438
♪ Who made heaven
a place on earth? ♪

01:32.483 --> 01:34.311
The hell was that?

01:38.750 --> 01:39.708
What the--

01:43.059 --> 01:44.713
Oh! Ah!

02:09.477 --> 02:11.740
Who's there?

02:59.527 --> 03:01.006
- Going somewhere?

03:01.050 --> 03:03.574
Spare me the sendoff, Lance.

03:03.618 --> 03:05.837
I'm leaving before you
and your band of botherers

03:05.881 --> 03:08.840
can suck me into another
world-saving sing-along.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.407
- Actually,
I was just gonna say

03:10.451 --> 03:12.104
we're still waiting
for you to move out.

03:12.148 --> 03:14.150
There's a box in the library
labeled "arcana"

03:14.194 --> 03:15.630
that's been sitting there
for months.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.197
- I'd avoid touching that
if I was you.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.894
- Yeah, Behrad already
tried to move it

03:18.937 --> 03:20.939
and now he thinks he's being
haunted by a forlorn mariner.

03:20.983 --> 03:23.420
- And he's right, but I can't
stick around to help the bloke.

03:23.464 --> 03:25.117
I'm off to research

03:25.161 --> 03:27.163
a more lasting solution
to your encore problem.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.209
- Did someone say encore?

03:29.252 --> 03:31.472
- I also said
no musical numbers,

03:31.515 --> 03:33.952
so please don't start.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.693
- Listen, I might have
a solution to your problem.

03:35.737 --> 03:38.130
- I can't take you with me
on this one, squire.

03:38.174 --> 03:41.482
Where I'm going,
I need to walk alone.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.048
With Gary.

03:43.092 --> 03:44.876
- Okay, but look--
we're on a timeship.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.531
And let's be honest,
we're a little past the whole

03:47.575 --> 03:49.446
"should we change history"
debate, right?

03:49.490 --> 03:51.361
So what if we go back

03:51.405 --> 03:52.841
to when the encores were kids

03:52.884 --> 03:56.061
and reform them
before they break bad?

03:56.105 --> 03:57.672
- Ray, we're dealing with
the villains of history

03:57.715 --> 03:59.064
fresh out of hell.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.370
They can't just be reformed
like you're--

04:00.414 --> 04:02.024
- Ray, where are you?

04:02.067 --> 04:05.027
- Like your
fairy god-girlfriend.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.594
Speaking of which,
I think that your

04:06.637 --> 04:08.596
services are required, squire.

04:10.989 --> 04:12.991
Well, look who's
finally off the clock.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.863
Oh, no, not again.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.038
- Oh, yes, oh, yes.

04:16.081 --> 04:17.953
It's the same thing every time.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.781
Kid gets a fairy godmother,
what do they wish for?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.045
You get a pony
and you get a pony.

04:23.088 --> 04:25.830
Everyone gets a damn pony.

04:25.874 --> 04:28.920
- Well, maybe next time,
you should say, "neigh."

04:28.964 --> 04:30.792
- Ugh.

04:30.835 --> 04:35.623
- Well, right now
it's all about what you want.

04:37.189 --> 04:40.715
What I want
is to be done with this gig.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.413
- I know, but look--

04:43.457 --> 04:45.154
at least with this job,

04:45.197 --> 04:47.330
you have the opportunity
to make people's lives better.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.158
- How am I supposed to
help kids in need

04:49.201 --> 04:51.682
when these kids don't even know
what they need?

04:51.726 --> 04:53.336
Because trust me--

04:53.380 --> 04:55.382
no one has ever become
a better person with a pony.

04:55.425 --> 04:56.731
- Probably true.

04:56.774 --> 04:59.342
But look, I'm setting the mood.

04:59.386 --> 05:02.737
Gideon, dim the lights,
and play

05:02.780 --> 05:06.915
"You're the Inspiration"
by Chicago.

05:06.958 --> 05:10.658
And now,
it's whatever you wish, Nora...

05:13.835 --> 05:16.316
- Gideon, don't play Chicago.

05:16.359 --> 05:19.231
- I wasn't going to,
Dr. Palmer.

05:23.540 --> 05:24.498
- Oh.

05:24.541 --> 05:25.977
- You sure being here

05:26.021 --> 05:28.415
doesn't bring back
some fond memories?

05:28.458 --> 05:30.373
- If I had fond memories
of this place,

05:30.417 --> 05:32.767
I'd book a lobotomy.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.072
Okay,
whatever you people do here,

05:34.116 --> 05:35.291
just show me the exit.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.858
I'm due for a content drop.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.816
Oh, and also
to tell Mâmn and Bâb

05:38.860 --> 05:40.078
you're not really
in business school.

05:40.122 --> 05:41.428
- But before you do that,

05:41.471 --> 05:42.864
let's make sure
you can't do that.

05:42.907 --> 05:44.909
Look over here.
- Ooh, is that a camera?

05:44.953 --> 05:46.258
- Wait!

05:46.302 --> 05:48.522
- Ugh, I don't want
my picture with him.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.785
- You can't wipe her memory,
all right?

05:50.828 --> 05:53.135
There's a timeline
where she was here, okay?

05:53.178 --> 05:54.528
So maybe her being here,

05:54.571 --> 05:56.399
she'll remember
what we did and who she was.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.532
- Look, I know Zari.

05:58.575 --> 06:01.404
And there's no way
she was ever anyone but her.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.971
- Hey, what's with the Wi-Fi?

06:03.014 --> 06:05.103
I need to clap back
at Blue Ivy on CatChat.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.238
CatChat's the chat app
that lets you clap back--

06:09.281 --> 06:11.283
- I didn't say tell me.

06:11.327 --> 06:13.590
- Mr. Tarazi and Mr. Heywood,
you're needed on the bridge.

06:13.634 --> 06:16.288
- Look, no one wants you
out of here more than I do,

06:16.332 --> 06:19.857
but I need you to stay put
until we finish this job.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.906
- Wait.
Wait, are you--

06:24.949 --> 06:26.342
are you taking me prisoner?

06:29.780 --> 06:31.434
I have a sneaker drop

06:31.478 --> 06:32.870
and I'm supposed
to be releasing

06:32.914 --> 06:34.481
a new fragrance
for Dragoness today.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.352
We have been working
on this launch for months.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.876
This is high stakes!

06:38.920 --> 06:41.139
- A serial killer
has been freed from hell

06:41.183 --> 06:43.577
and is on the loose in 2004.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.579
- And somehow, the scariest
thing about this mission

06:45.622 --> 06:48.277
is going back
to the early 2000s.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.235
- A coroner was found dead

06:50.279 --> 06:51.585
while transporting the body
of a famed serial killer.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.195
Oh, my God.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.502
It's Freddy Meyers,
the Prom Night Slasher.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.112
Come on, guys.

06:57.155 --> 07:00.202
I ranked him #5 killer
of all time on Stab Cast.

07:00.245 --> 07:02.334
My podcast
about serial killers--babe?

07:02.378 --> 07:03.335
- Oh.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.033
- As I was going to say,

07:05.076 --> 07:06.251
Freddy killed seven
of his peers before--

07:06.295 --> 07:07.949
- At his high school prom
in 1989.

07:07.992 --> 07:10.342
He used a kitchen knife
and he wore a creepy mask.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.822
I actually did
a whole series on it.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.911
So none of you open my emails,
clearly?

07:13.955 --> 07:15.260
- And following the murders--

07:15.304 --> 07:16.871
- He spent 15 years
on death row

07:16.914 --> 07:18.481
before he was executed in 2004.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.135
- Which is when
the timeline changed,

07:20.178 --> 07:21.789
starting with
the death of the coroner

07:21.832 --> 07:23.486
and the disappearance
of Freddy's body.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.227
- I don't even want
to think about

07:25.270 --> 07:26.968
what a serial killer would do
with his second act.

07:27.011 --> 07:29.405
- Tiffany!

07:29.449 --> 07:30.537
She was the final girl.

07:30.580 --> 07:31.973
The one target--

07:32.016 --> 07:34.628
together:
That survived Freddy's attack!

07:34.671 --> 07:37.152
- It's informative
and entertaining.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.153
It's good.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.284
- See?
Thank you.

07:39.328 --> 07:40.634
- Guys, check this out.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.505
"The Central City High
class of '89

07:42.549 --> 07:45.073
"is planning to memorialize
their fallen peers

07:45.116 --> 07:48.642
at their 15-year reunion
this Friday night."

07:48.685 --> 07:50.295
- We have to go.

07:50.339 --> 07:51.471
That's where Freddy will be
to finish the job.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.124
- Well then, babe,

07:53.168 --> 07:54.865
grab your autograph book,

07:54.909 --> 07:56.867
because we're gonna
go catch a serial killer.

07:56.911 --> 07:59.087
Gideon, take us to 2004.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.871
- And order
one of these mattresses

08:00.915 --> 08:03.570
using promo code "LACERATION."

08:09.489 --> 08:11.229
- We're heading in.

08:11.273 --> 08:13.362
You guys keep an eye out
for a crazy masked killer.

08:13.405 --> 08:16.408
- The only thing killing it
out here is my wardrobe.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.236
- I can't believe I'm here.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.022
Seriously--
oh, my God, oh, my God.

08:21.065 --> 08:24.155
This is the lobby
where he stalked his victims.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.635
You guys--

08:25.679 --> 08:28.072
he made his first kill
in this cafeteria!

08:28.116 --> 08:29.944
Babe!

08:29.987 --> 08:31.685
- What, what?
- Babe!

08:31.728 --> 08:33.121
That's the trophy
that Tiffany fashioned

08:33.164 --> 08:34.905
into a makeshift weapon.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.385
- Why didn't you tell me

08:36.428 --> 08:37.734
we were coming back
to my old school?

08:37.778 --> 08:39.606
- You went to school here?
- What?

08:39.649 --> 08:41.869
- Mick, this is why you need
to come to team meetings.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.653
Do you remember anything
about Freddy?

08:43.697 --> 08:45.307
- Yeah.
He was a loser.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.613
- Oh, come on.

08:46.656 --> 08:49.050
- Frickin' Mick Rory.

08:49.093 --> 08:51.356
Allie, remember?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.444
Is that you, or...

08:52.488 --> 08:53.620
- No.

08:53.663 --> 08:54.969
- Are you sure?

08:55.012 --> 08:57.537
'Cause you look, like,
exactly like Mick.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.581
Mick Rory.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.322
- No.
My name's--

09:00.365 --> 09:02.367
Dick.

09:02.411 --> 09:05.632
- Tellin' ya, Dick.
Team meetings work wonders.

09:05.675 --> 09:08.852
It's her!

09:08.896 --> 09:10.506
It's Tiffany.

09:13.161 --> 09:15.990
Tiffany Harper.
It's really you.

09:16.033 --> 09:18.383
- Who are you?

09:18.427 --> 09:20.603
- I'm Lisa and this is Kelly

09:20.647 --> 09:23.563
and you wouldn't remember us
'cause we were losers.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.086
Total zeroes.

09:25.129 --> 09:27.697
- I don't.
Isn't time weird?

09:27.741 --> 09:29.133
- So weird.

09:29.177 --> 09:31.440
- Well, see you inside.
- Thank you.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.268
- And go Cavaliers!

09:34.835 --> 09:37.141
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, go, keep going.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.491
- Hope you're enjoying
your reunion out there.

09:39.535 --> 09:42.930
Keep on dancing, class of '89.

09:42.973 --> 09:45.193
No sign of Freddy.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.630
But I got eyes on crudités.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.850
- Ooh,
save me some raw broccoli.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.078
I never thought I'd say this,

10:01.122 --> 10:02.950
but I think I've lost
my appetite for broccoli.

10:02.993 --> 10:05.735
- Whoa.
Guys, Freddy's on the scene.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.955
He's got his first victim.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.173
- We're ready for him.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.349
- Uh, hello!
Hello, everyone.

10:11.393 --> 10:12.916
Welcome back.

10:12.960 --> 10:16.354
It means so much
to see all of you here tonight.

10:16.398 --> 10:20.489
And here to unveil our memorial
to our fallen peers

10:20.532 --> 10:23.797
is our very own survivor,
Tiffany Harper.

10:29.454 --> 10:30.804
Has anyone seen Tiffany?

10:30.847 --> 10:32.283
- Something's wrong.

10:41.205 --> 10:44.208
Of course she makes
a dramatic entrance.

10:45.775 --> 10:48.648
We didn't cover this
in rehearsal, Tiffany.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.391
All right, that's it.
I'm unveiling it myself.

10:58.179 --> 11:01.356
- All right, everybody!
Just stay calm.

11:01.399 --> 11:03.445
Okay, he's here.
We need backup.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.229
- It's him.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.770
- Guys, watch out.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.815
You're stuck in the school
with the Prom Night Slasher.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.573
- Master,
I'm sorry I'm so late.

11:44.616 --> 11:47.228
I tried a teleportation spell
to get here ASAP

11:47.271 --> 11:49.230
and now I'm stuck
walking backwards.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.060
Damn it, Gary.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.061
Pull yourself together,
will you?

11:54.104 --> 11:56.019
We've got work to do.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.456
And the answers we need
lie behind this door.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.110
- What is this place?

12:00.154 --> 12:01.764
- I can't say I've ever had
anything as comfy as a home,

12:01.808 --> 12:03.374
but I lived here once.

12:03.418 --> 12:06.290
And not a soul has stepped foot
inside since I left.

12:12.035 --> 12:15.865
What the bloody hell?

12:15.909 --> 12:19.434
Oi, what are you doing
in my house?

12:19.477 --> 12:20.696
Hey, go on!

12:20.740 --> 12:23.699
Get off my stairs.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.614
All right,
who's responsible for this?

12:25.657 --> 12:29.270
- And lo, and I thought I was
the one with the magic touch.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.405
All right, everybody out.

12:34.449 --> 12:37.147
Any of you wanna party you do
it somewhere else, all right?

12:40.107 --> 12:42.762
How did you even find
this place, Charlie?

12:45.503 --> 12:47.679
- You told me about it
when you were wasted once.

12:49.812 --> 12:54.425
- You found your way here,
you can find your way out.

12:54.469 --> 12:56.819
- What is with him, huh?

12:56.863 --> 12:58.168
What are you doing here?

12:58.212 --> 12:59.735
- Do the Constantine trick
again.

13:01.215 --> 13:02.564
- All right, everyone.
Stay sharp.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.087
The killer could be anywhere.

13:04.131 --> 13:07.395
- We gotta get everyone
out of here.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.051
- Thanks for the heart attack!

13:11.094 --> 13:12.835
- Sorry, Swiss Army Knife
usually solves a jam in a jiff,

13:12.879 --> 13:14.619
but these doors are
telekinetically sealed.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.056
No way in or out.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.666
- This place
always felt like a prison.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.407
- Telekinesis,
it makes perfect sense.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.322
Killers often act
out of feeling powerless

13:21.365 --> 13:23.193
and now he has
the ultimate power.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.586
I need to adjust my rankings.

13:24.629 --> 13:25.805
- Yeah,
and we need to save Allie.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.502
I mean, the class of '89.

13:27.545 --> 13:31.114
- All right, immortal killer--
how do we stop it?

13:31.158 --> 13:33.900
- We can't from in here
but maybe you guys can.

13:33.943 --> 13:36.554
Look, Ray, it's time to put
your crazy plan to the test.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.600
We gotta go back
and fix Freddy.

13:45.650 --> 13:46.738
- All right.

13:46.782 --> 13:49.741
Let's find our future encore.

13:49.785 --> 13:50.960
- Freddy!

13:51.004 --> 13:52.396
Hey, Freddy!

13:52.440 --> 13:54.442
Heard you couldn't
find a prom date.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.661
Guess your mom turned you down.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.796
Loser.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.279
- Nice one, Brad!

14:05.322 --> 14:08.499
- Losers.
- Brad's such a jerk.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.893
- Oh, it's okay. You don't have
to do it, it's all right.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.329
I got it, thank you.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.070
- Actually, I wanted
to ask you something.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.985
Turns out I don't have a date
to prom tonight

14:16.029 --> 14:17.987
and I was thinking...

14:18.031 --> 14:19.554
would you go with me?

14:20.772 --> 14:22.426
Me go with you to prom?

14:22.470 --> 14:24.559
- Exactly. Meet me in front
of the school at 8:00.

14:24.602 --> 14:25.560
Don't be late.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.957
- Oy vey, this is bad.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.482
Why would the most popular girl
need a last-minute date,

14:34.525 --> 14:36.049
let alone ask him?

14:36.092 --> 14:37.877
She's working with those boys.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.488
This could be
what sets him off.

14:40.531 --> 14:43.839
Okay, we gotta talk this kid
out of his dream date.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.104
Let's rap, Freddy.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.845
- Who are--who are you guys?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.978
- New teachers.
Cool new teachers.

14:52.021 --> 14:55.720
And, uh, judging by
your test scores here,

14:55.764 --> 14:57.853
maybe you should skip the prom
and hit the books.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.855
Turn this A into an A+.

14:59.899 --> 15:00.987
- Or maybe go to the movies.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.945
1989's a great movie summer.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.294
"Last Crusade,"
"Ghostbusters II"--

15:04.338 --> 15:06.166
- Yeah, I gotta go, so...

15:09.343 --> 15:11.127
- Hey, no running
in the hallway.

15:11.171 --> 15:13.913
- We're not just your teachers,
we're your pals!

15:21.703 --> 15:23.183
- Picture a dark hallway.

15:23.226 --> 15:25.272
It feels like the killer's
there with you.

15:25.315 --> 15:29.189
Shafts of moonlight
claw at the floor.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.756
Glowing exit sign
you may never reach.

15:34.063 --> 15:36.326
- Come out here, Freddy!
We know you're there.

15:36.370 --> 15:37.849
- Yeah, come on out!

15:37.893 --> 15:39.590
There are gaps in
your psychological profile

15:39.634 --> 15:40.722
that you need to answer for.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.115
- Babe.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.117
- And we're gonna
send you back to hell.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.857
- Yeah!

15:50.601 --> 15:52.168
- Did you find a way out?

15:52.212 --> 15:54.127
- Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

15:54.170 --> 15:55.606
Get back in the gym.

15:59.871 --> 16:01.134
- Babe!

16:04.137 --> 16:05.181
- Whoa.

16:22.894 --> 16:26.202
- Freddy ran off on us.
- We need his address.

16:26.246 --> 16:27.899
- I got you.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.254
- Nora?

16:37.039 --> 16:38.475
Nora, what's wrong?

16:38.519 --> 16:41.348
- I can hear them, their--
their voices.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.002
Fairy godmothers have sort of

16:43.045 --> 16:45.265
a special radar
that tunes into kids' wishes,

16:45.308 --> 16:48.790
and prom night is
a minefield of teenage need,

16:48.833 --> 16:51.923
so when it locks onto the kid
with the deepest need

16:51.967 --> 16:55.057
I just go straight to--

16:55.101 --> 16:57.277
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, it's happening.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.763
- Where the hell
did you come from, huh?

17:05.807 --> 17:07.765
- Oh, Freddy.
Uh--

17:07.809 --> 17:08.766
- Huh?

17:08.810 --> 17:13.249
- I am your fairy godmother.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.121
So...

17:17.340 --> 17:19.212
Please don't kill me?

17:23.651 --> 17:26.306
- You're a fairy godmother?
My fairy godmother?

17:26.349 --> 17:28.221
- Uh-huh.
- Prove it.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.136
- You think I'd be wearing this
if I really had the choice?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.356
Huh?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.924
- So anything I ask for
you have to do it.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.231
- So you should really think
about what you want,

17:38.274 --> 17:41.060
especially the consequences.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.584
- I already know what I want.

17:43.627 --> 17:44.846
Prom's tonight and--

17:44.889 --> 17:47.196
- Freddy, honey!

17:47.240 --> 17:48.763
- Hide--no!

17:51.287 --> 17:53.768
- Hey, Freddy.
Ready, Freddy, for movie night?

17:53.811 --> 17:55.639
I got the Jiffy Pop going.
- Uh, actually, Mom--

17:55.683 --> 17:56.901
- Ray, I'm with Freddy.

17:56.945 --> 17:58.599
- Nora!
Good, that's great.

17:58.642 --> 17:59.991
- How is that great?

18:00.035 --> 18:01.906
I'm a serial killer's
fairy godmother.

18:01.950 --> 18:04.126
- This is perfect. Old Freddy
didn't have a fairy godmother.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.738
So if you give him the prom
every kid dreams of

18:07.782 --> 18:09.523
maybe he won't hurt anyone.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.481
- Except this kid's dream
is for everyone to be dead.

18:12.874 --> 18:13.918
Oh!

18:13.962 --> 18:16.747
- Mm, prom?
- Mm-hmm.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.706
- Wow, Freddy.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.751
Uh, do you need a ride, or...

18:20.795 --> 18:22.405
I could help you with your tie.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.364
- Oh--you know, I got it.
But, um, I love you, okay?

18:24.407 --> 18:25.365
I just gotta go.

18:25.408 --> 18:26.453
- Oh.
- Okay.

18:27.932 --> 18:31.284
Now, back to my wish.

18:34.548 --> 18:37.420
I'm gonna make it so those kids
never make fun of me again,

18:37.464 --> 18:39.988
because I wish for...

18:40.031 --> 18:41.816
a suit.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.426
- A suit?

18:43.470 --> 18:44.775
- Yeah,
if I'm gonna take Tiffany

18:44.819 --> 18:46.690
I gotta look good,
so I want a cool suit.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.170
Can you do that?

18:48.214 --> 18:50.259
- Yeah, I can do that.
- Okay.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.174
- Ready?
- Yeah.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.834
Check it out.

18:59.877 --> 19:03.229
Oh, my--
okay, okay.

19:03.272 --> 19:05.840
Now I gotta show up in style.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.058
I want a pony.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.234
Seriously, kid?

19:21.029 --> 19:23.597
- ♪ I've fallen in love

19:23.640 --> 19:28.167

19:48.709 --> 19:51.059
- Hey, Palmer.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.495
Will you go to prom with me?

19:52.539 --> 19:54.193

I knew it.

20:16.084 --> 20:18.217
You stole our family's totem.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.784
- It's not like that, I--
I needed to take it.

20:20.828 --> 20:22.525
- I mean, you could've just
asked for it.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.440
Mâmn and Bâb would've
given it to you.

20:24.484 --> 20:26.573
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, you really don't know?

20:28.096 --> 20:29.967
You're never around,
you don't do any work,

20:30.011 --> 20:32.709
and they still treat you
like you're some kind of hero.

20:32.753 --> 20:34.842
- If you only knew
what I've done,

20:34.885 --> 20:37.671
what I've survived,
without getting any credit.

20:37.714 --> 20:39.020
Not that you'd understand,

20:39.063 --> 20:40.064
'cause you only
care about yourself.

20:40.108 --> 20:41.283
- Whatever, don't tell me.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.893
But wait till they see you've

20:42.937 --> 20:44.547
turned it into
a stupid stoner bracelet--hey!

20:44.591 --> 20:46.070
- What up, Z-listers?

20:46.114 --> 20:47.942
Turns out even a sacred totem

20:47.985 --> 20:50.510
couldn't reverse the sucking
void that is my soul.

20:50.553 --> 20:53.513
- Hey, screw you.
I'm not a void.

20:53.556 --> 20:55.776
I'm a business.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.170
- Not like
it works here anyway.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.140
- Everybody, stay calm.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.316
Once the power's back
we'll get help.

21:25.806 --> 21:27.808
- Where do you think
you're going?

21:27.851 --> 21:29.897
- I'm gonna find a way
out of this school.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.508
Look at them,
just waiting to be picked off.

21:32.552 --> 21:33.944
Never fit in with them
when I went here

21:33.988 --> 21:35.598
and I'm sure as hell
not gonna die with them.

21:35.642 --> 21:38.819
- Hmm.
I like the way you think.

21:38.862 --> 21:41.474
There's an old vent in the wood
shop I used to sneak out of.

21:41.517 --> 21:44.651
- I knew it.
Mick frickin' Rory.

21:46.217 --> 21:48.263
Come on, let's get the hell
out of this school.

21:50.004 --> 21:53.137
- You have a husband?
Boyfriend?

21:53.181 --> 21:54.530
Girlfriend?

21:54.574 --> 21:55.792
- Eh.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.707
No one's waiting at home
for me.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.883
Still haven't quite
gotten that together.

21:59.927 --> 22:00.884
- Hmm.

22:00.928 --> 22:03.147
- And you?

22:03.191 --> 22:06.629
- Um, it's behind here.

22:06.673 --> 22:09.458
- Hey.

22:09.502 --> 22:12.766
Do you ever wonder
where we'd be if, you know,

22:12.809 --> 22:14.681
that prom had gone differently,
like if...

22:14.724 --> 22:15.769
we'd--

22:26.432 --> 22:29.826
- You'd better be
fixing this in '89.

22:48.584 --> 22:51.370
- So this is prom.

22:52.980 --> 22:55.025
- I know it's lame, but--
- No, no, no, no.

22:55.069 --> 22:58.202
Actually I think I kinda
get the whole nostalgia thing

22:58.246 --> 22:59.769
for once.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.684
- And we're gonna
slow it down for the next one.

23:01.728 --> 23:06.689
So everyone, grab your sweeties
and get on the dance floor.

23:12.303 --> 23:17.004
- ♪ Down this lonely road,
you walk away ♪

23:17.047 --> 23:18.788
- Oh, I love this song.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.660
- Yeah, me too.

23:20.703 --> 23:23.880
- You know,
you're a really good dancer.

23:23.924 --> 23:25.273
- Thanks, I--

23:25.316 --> 23:26.448
I watch a lot of music videos.

23:26.492 --> 23:27.536
- Oh.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.756
- Aww, they look so happy.

23:29.799 --> 23:32.149
- Yeah, but they don't.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.937
So that's the prank.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.504
She leads him to
the center of the dance floor

23:38.547 --> 23:40.375
and they drop trash
on his head.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.855
Classic "Carrie."

23:41.898 --> 23:44.248
Bet these bullies
don't know how that ended.

23:44.292 --> 23:46.294
- Well, we gotta keep them
from walking in the drop zone.

23:46.337 --> 23:49.689
- I think it's gonna be okay.

23:51.255 --> 23:55.999
- ♪ And I'll wait

23:56.043 --> 23:58.262
- It's a little crowded
over there.

23:58.306 --> 23:59.873
- Is this good?
- Yeah.

23:59.916 --> 24:05.400
- ♪ There's just one thing
I know ♪

24:05.444 --> 24:07.707
♪ I'll never let go

24:07.750 --> 24:08.969
- Hey, Freddy.

24:11.232 --> 24:12.581
- Nice suit.

24:12.625 --> 24:15.062
It would suck if it got ruined.

24:15.105 --> 24:16.977
- Brad, wait.
- Come on, Tiff!

24:17.020 --> 24:20.067
This is how the prank
was supposed to go, right?

24:20.110 --> 24:22.591
- Prank?
What are you talking about?

24:22.635 --> 24:24.854
- He still doesn't get it.

24:24.898 --> 24:28.597
You think she actually
wanted to go out with you?

24:28.641 --> 24:31.382
It was a setup, butt lump.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.431
- Tiffany, is that true?

24:36.475 --> 24:39.869
- No--
I mean not anymore, Freddy.

24:43.003 --> 24:45.309
- No, Freddy.

24:45.353 --> 24:47.224
Freddy, it's gonna be okay.

24:56.886 --> 25:00.237
- We just went from
John Hughes to John Carpenter.

25:00.281 --> 25:01.369
- I take it back.

25:01.412 --> 25:02.457
High school sucks.

25:06.635 --> 25:08.376
- Come out here and face me,
you bastard.

25:08.419 --> 25:10.073
- Rory, are you trying
to get yourself killed?

25:10.117 --> 25:11.510
- He killed Allie.
He's gonna pay!

25:11.553 --> 25:12.946
- She wasn't just some girl,
was she?

25:15.339 --> 25:16.732
She was my prom date.

25:16.776 --> 25:18.560
We went to
the same school together

25:18.604 --> 25:21.171
and we kind of had a thing.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.782
Then I went to juvie

25:22.825 --> 25:25.175
but we still wrote letters
to one another.

25:25.219 --> 25:26.655
I was gonna break out

25:26.699 --> 25:28.918
and take her
to the stupid dance,

25:28.962 --> 25:30.180
but then I blew her off.

25:30.224 --> 25:32.008
- Rory.
- What?

25:32.052 --> 25:33.923
I was young, stupid.

25:33.967 --> 25:35.838
- Mick, look, I'm sorry, okay?

25:35.882 --> 25:39.059
But if this plan works then
Freddy never becomes an encore.

25:39.102 --> 25:41.714
Maybe everything that happened
can be undone.

25:41.757 --> 25:45.456
Maybe we can still save Allie.

25:47.197 --> 25:49.330
- Freddy, wait.
- Leave me alone.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.898
What?

25:51.941 --> 25:53.595
- You don't want
to be alone right now.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.510
- How would you know that?
How would you know what I want?

25:55.554 --> 25:58.165
I spent years wanting
these kids to be my friend

25:58.208 --> 26:00.863
and I couldn't even make it
happen with a fairy godmother!

26:00.907 --> 26:03.170
I cannot wait to be done
with this stupid place

26:03.213 --> 26:04.693
and I hope they all
get what they deserve.

26:04.737 --> 26:06.173
- No, you don't mean that.

26:06.216 --> 26:08.349
- Yeah, I do.
- No, you don't.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.786
Look, I get it.
I have given in to my demons.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.353
I know what it's like

26:12.396 --> 26:14.007
to want to make the world
feel your pain,

26:14.050 --> 26:16.183
but that is not who you are.

26:16.226 --> 26:17.924
I see so much more in you.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.188
Listen.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.322
- God, being yourself...

26:27.411 --> 26:30.284
That is a magic
stronger than any wish.

26:32.416 --> 26:36.638
Being truly okay with myself,
scars and all,

26:36.682 --> 26:39.249
is how the right people
truly found me.

26:42.209 --> 26:45.647
Now, if you had
one more wish...

26:47.518 --> 26:50.130
To show all of them
who you really are,

26:50.173 --> 26:51.653
what'll it be?

26:56.049 --> 26:58.355
- Uh, how concerned
should we be?

26:58.399 --> 27:02.664
- I say medium.

have I lost

28:17.608 --> 28:19.610
since I've been stuck
in this dump?

28:19.654 --> 28:22.875
- I can't do that,
Miss Tarazi.

28:22.918 --> 28:24.703
- It's probably best
I don't know.

28:26.574 --> 28:28.924
Wait, does this computer
get internet?

28:35.235 --> 28:38.499
It's a computer program
I designed to hack it.

28:45.549 --> 28:48.335
- How did you bypass my
encrypted security protocol?

28:48.378 --> 28:50.946
- Oh, just by being
a businesswoman, makeup guru,

28:50.990 --> 28:53.340
bad bitch, and overall genius.

28:53.383 --> 28:55.995
Now call me a ride, computer.

29:04.917 --> 29:07.528
- Hey. You were really good
out there, Freddy.

29:07.571 --> 29:08.790
- Takes some real confidence

29:08.834 --> 29:10.444
to bust out backup dancers
at prom.

29:10.487 --> 29:12.359
- So this gets to be,
like, your job,

29:12.402 --> 29:13.490
making things better for kids?

29:13.534 --> 29:17.494
- Yeah.
Yeah, it is.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.409
- Look, there's gotta be
a bunch of kids out there

29:19.453 --> 29:20.802
that could probably
use your help,

29:20.846 --> 29:22.717
and I think I'm gonna be okay.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.850
Thank you, though.
For everything.

29:36.209 --> 29:38.037
- Oh, there's my ride.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.734
Ugh, vintage.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.518
Well,

29:41.562 --> 29:43.346
at least the computer knows
I like to travel in style.

29:50.266 --> 29:51.833
- That was fun.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.226
- Yeah, and the night's
just getting started.

29:53.269 --> 29:54.923
- I know.

29:54.967 --> 29:57.230
Well, you can take my limo
wherever we want to go.

29:57.273 --> 29:58.797
After you.
- Thank you.

30:03.192 --> 30:06.195
- Ugh, she booked me
a shared ride.

30:22.211 --> 30:23.430
- Guys, they fixed it.

30:23.473 --> 30:25.345
- Ray's plan actually worked?

30:25.388 --> 30:27.782
- Apparently, Freddy's
a really solid dancer.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.915
And he's not gonna go
on a killing spree at prom.

30:33.092 --> 30:34.745
- Then who is that?

30:36.269 --> 30:38.445
- Die, you bastard!

30:47.280 --> 30:48.324
- Nick!

30:49.717 --> 30:50.674
Hey.

30:50.718 --> 30:51.937
No, no.

30:56.463 --> 30:59.422
- Sara, look.

31:04.819 --> 31:07.691
Kathy Meyers?

31:07.735 --> 31:09.302
She must be the encore.

31:09.345 --> 31:12.871
- They wanted to take my Freddy
away from me.

31:12.914 --> 31:16.091
But when that girl
asked him to prom,

31:16.135 --> 31:19.312
I knew I had to kill her
and all of his new friends.

31:19.355 --> 31:21.836
Now I get to finish
what I started.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.709
- Hey, are you guys
getting any service?

31:25.753 --> 31:28.408
Oh, I know
what you guys are thinking.

31:28.451 --> 31:32.673
Yes, it's me.
The Dragon Girl.

31:32.716 --> 31:34.718
Wait, why aren't we moving?

31:34.762 --> 31:36.982
- Driver, what's going on?

31:39.767 --> 31:41.900
- Close it!
Close the door, close it!

31:43.553 --> 31:46.208
- You killed our friend.
You killed those kids.

31:46.252 --> 31:47.993
- But you're not gonna
get away with it this time.

31:48.036 --> 31:51.431
- I won't let anyone
stand between me and my boy.

31:51.474 --> 31:53.085
And you're next.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.006
- Sara!

32:01.049 --> 32:02.398
- Close the door!
- Close the door!

32:17.500 --> 32:18.632
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:18.675 --> 32:19.938
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.765
Before you kill me,

32:21.809 --> 32:23.376
there's just something
I don't understand, huh?

32:23.419 --> 32:24.594
How did you get here?

32:24.638 --> 32:26.640
Come on,
every killer has a story.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.294
Why don't you
tell me yours, yeah?

32:28.337 --> 32:31.166
- After I killed those brats,

32:31.210 --> 32:34.126
my Freddy took the fall.

32:34.169 --> 32:36.606
He wanted to protect me,

32:36.650 --> 32:38.521
but I knew I couldn't
live without him.

32:38.565 --> 32:40.915
And I was right, because he's
not the only one who died

32:40.959 --> 32:42.786
the night of his execution.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.664
I had a heart attack
right there in Iron Heights.

32:50.707 --> 32:53.449
I died with him!

32:53.493 --> 32:54.929
But then,

32:54.973 --> 32:57.323
I was sent back from hell.

32:59.542 --> 33:01.762
Given a second chance,

33:01.805 --> 33:04.591
a chance to bring Freddy home
where he belongs.

33:04.634 --> 33:07.855
A chance to finish
the job I started.

33:07.898 --> 33:11.902
And no one can ever take
us away from each other.

33:20.781 --> 33:22.478
- Babe, it's happening.

33:22.522 --> 33:23.958
- We're final girls!

33:48.243 --> 33:49.723
- That's right!

33:49.766 --> 33:52.378
Feel the burn of Dragoness,
you psycho!

33:56.164 --> 33:57.339
- Mom?

33:59.776 --> 34:02.692
What are you doing?

34:02.736 --> 34:05.391
- Freddy,
I'm doing this for you.

34:05.434 --> 34:07.610
For us.

34:07.654 --> 34:10.961
I can't lose you, Freddy.
I can't live without you.

34:11.005 --> 34:12.267
Let me do this, Freddy.

34:14.791 --> 34:16.750
- I can't move.

34:26.847 --> 34:30.198
- You don't need them,
you need me.

34:30.242 --> 34:32.374
We could get away with this
together.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.811
- No, no.

34:34.855 --> 34:38.250
I-I know who I am now and
I'm not gonna lock myself away.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.036
- Then this is
for your own good.

34:55.049 --> 34:57.399
- They did it!

34:59.619 --> 35:01.664
- Behrad?

35:01.708 --> 35:03.101
- It's all right.

35:03.144 --> 35:04.624
You okay?

35:04.667 --> 35:06.669
- I totally get
why you stole that.

35:06.713 --> 35:08.280
Fair enough.

35:09.933 --> 35:13.111
Wow, this is a lot.

35:40.225 --> 35:44.054
- I know she needs help, but...

35:44.098 --> 35:45.752
she was all I had.

35:45.795 --> 35:48.363
And they took her away.

35:48.407 --> 35:50.278
- Mm-hmm.

35:50.322 --> 35:52.933
- So what do I do?

35:52.976 --> 35:54.978
- Survive.

35:55.022 --> 36:00.288
Freddy, my upbringing
was only dysfunction.

36:00.332 --> 36:04.727
But dysfunction doesn't
get to choose who you are.

36:04.771 --> 36:08.122
You do.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.123
You hear me?

36:09.167 --> 36:11.256
- Yeah, okay.

36:11.299 --> 36:14.215
- We should, uh, head back
and check on the team

36:14.259 --> 36:16.391
and make sure everything's
back to normal.

36:19.612 --> 36:22.528
- I know you're gonna
be okay, kid.

36:39.240 --> 36:42.461
- Dr. Gideon
treating you right?

36:42.504 --> 36:44.245
Pretty cool, huh?

36:44.289 --> 36:45.986
- So this is what you do?

36:46.029 --> 36:48.815
Travel around time
and save people using wind?

36:48.858 --> 36:51.209
That's...

36:51.252 --> 36:54.429
I wouldn't say cool,
exactly, but...

36:54.473 --> 36:56.736
no wonder you're the favorite.

36:56.779 --> 36:58.607
- The favorite?

36:58.651 --> 37:00.522
Mâmn and Bâb
only treat me how they do

37:00.566 --> 37:02.132
'cause they're worried
about me.

37:02.176 --> 37:05.266
I mean, I've been in
business school for five years.

37:05.310 --> 37:08.313
You were a self-made
millionaire by the age of 19.

37:08.356 --> 37:10.576
- You're right,
I am very impressive.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.926
- Like, how did you jailbreak
your way out of here anyway?

37:12.969 --> 37:15.450
- I was poking around
your weird little screens

37:15.494 --> 37:18.671
and suddenly I knew
how to hack my way out.

37:18.714 --> 37:20.281
- Right.

37:20.325 --> 37:23.937
Yeah, time travel always has
these weird side effects.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.982
- Huh.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.767
Well, hopefully it wears off

37:27.810 --> 37:30.596
because I was thinking
of sticking around for a while.

37:30.639 --> 37:33.512
- Huh.
I weirdly wouldn't hate that.

37:33.555 --> 37:35.818
- Hey, guys.
We're still in 2004.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.777
Where the hell are you?
- You coming?

37:43.870 --> 37:45.611
- How about this for a reunion?

37:45.654 --> 37:49.179
all: Hey!

37:51.660 --> 37:54.881
- And, uh,
what's your sister doing here?

37:54.924 --> 37:56.361
- Probably CatChatting.

37:56.404 --> 37:57.492
No judgment here.

37:57.536 --> 37:59.364
- Yes.
- Wait.

37:59.407 --> 38:00.452
Where's Mick?

38:06.632 --> 38:08.155
- Mick?

38:10.070 --> 38:11.898
Mick Rory?

38:13.639 --> 38:15.249
- Allie.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.120

a place on earth ♪

38:17.164 --> 38:20.950
♪ They say in heaven,

38:20.994 --> 38:22.604

38:22.648 --> 38:25.346
Hey, Tiffany.

38:25.390 --> 38:27.914
- ♪ Ooh, heaven

38:27.957 --> 38:30.264
- Nora, may I have this dance?

38:30.308 --> 38:33.136
- Ah, but of course.

38:36.923 --> 38:38.838
- I cannot believe I got to

38:38.881 --> 38:40.927
get an exclusive scoop
for Stab Cast

38:40.970 --> 38:42.537
and I got to be the final girl.

38:42.581 --> 38:44.844
- Well, technically,
I never died, so.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.976
- Technically, you've died
more than three times,

38:47.020 --> 38:48.369
so just give me this one, babe.

38:50.066 --> 38:52.025
You are my final girl.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.290
- Hey, guys.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.291
Photo booth.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.772
- Whoo!

38:59.815 --> 39:00.773
- Do we look okay?

39:02.644 --> 39:06.300
- ♪ When you walk

39:06.344 --> 39:09.434

39:17.572 --> 39:21.402

39:26.494 --> 39:29.584
Wow, Mick.

39:29.628 --> 39:31.543
- That's my gun.

39:31.586 --> 39:32.587
- Oh.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.427
I thought I told you
to piss off.

39:46.471 --> 39:48.864
- Gary just filled me in
on that business with Astra.

39:48.908 --> 39:50.170
So why are you
drowning your sorrows

39:50.213 --> 39:52.738
instead of doing something
about it?

39:52.781 --> 39:54.783
What happened here, John?

40:00.093 --> 40:02.487
I used to run with a bunch
back in the day.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.445
Became known
as the Newcastle Crew,

40:04.489 --> 40:06.969
spent most of our misbegotten
youth in this place.

40:10.538 --> 40:13.193
One of them was
a powerful witch.

40:13.236 --> 40:16.022
I'm back here
to consult with her.

40:16.065 --> 40:17.545
She's through there.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.464
- So what are you waiting for?

40:23.508 --> 40:25.205
Come on, get off your ass
and go and do it.

40:25.248 --> 40:27.773
- Because it's not that easy,
all right, Charlie?

40:27.816 --> 40:30.819
That witch is
Astra's dead mother.

40:30.863 --> 40:34.127
Her spirit is waiting on the
other side of that door and...

40:34.170 --> 40:35.955
none too happy with me.

40:35.998 --> 40:41.134
- There are things in my past
that I haven't told anyone.

40:41.177 --> 40:44.529
So I get the whole
wanting to do it on your own.

40:44.572 --> 40:46.661
But if there was some door
that I could walk through

40:46.705 --> 40:49.882
to solve all my problems,

40:49.925 --> 40:52.319
I sure as hell would
take that chance.

41:03.243 --> 41:05.071
- I call upon Hecate,

41:05.114 --> 41:08.422
lady of keys
and guardian of crossroads.

41:12.426 --> 41:14.210
Sever this seal.

41:18.345 --> 41:20.608
By my blood, be open.

41:32.925 --> 41:36.624
- Don't look back, Johno.
You got this.

41:36.668 --> 41:38.234
- Let's hope
you're right, love.

42:11.311 --> 42:12.747
- Greg, move your head.
