He's trying to get rid of it

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
and move on.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
I figured helping him

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
is the least I could do.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
When he asked who was calling,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
I said Larry Trainor.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I didn't know what else to say.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
At least you said something.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
All thing considered,

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
you're having a far

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
better day than me.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
You auditioned.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
My mouth opened.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Words came out.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
But I don't know

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
if I'd call it an audition

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
any more than I'd call

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
myself an actor.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
How about you make

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
that drink to go?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
[Dorothy] Cliff.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Hi, Cliffie.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
[Baby Doll laughs]

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
How are you, Cliff?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
[Cliff] Top shelf.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So are you two

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
running buddies now?

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Two little masters

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
of disaster? Nice.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Yes, siree.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
We're very close friends.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
[both giggling]

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
-Hey.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
-[girls squealing]

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
[Cliff] Those two are just

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
cuter than shit.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Man, you missed out

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
on a killer tea party.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
[Cliff] What?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
What?

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
B-A-B-Y D-O-L-L.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Who's the best?

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Baby Doll!

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Do you want me

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
to make you a song?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I'm really good at it.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
D-O-R-Y... No, wait.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
D-O-R-O-T-E-E. Dorotee!

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
[Dorothy chuckles]

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Why don't we sit down

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
for a bit?

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
No, no. The grass is lava.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
-I'm tired.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
-Oh, no, don't be tired.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
We'll play something else.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Tag! [panting]

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Pirate ship. Arr!

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Pirate ship?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
[Baby Doll giggles]

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
[Candlemaker]

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
An infant game

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
for infant girls.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Oh, now you're talking to me.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
I thought I told you,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
I'm not a grown-up.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Quick. You have to spin.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
If you don't spin,

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
the world will explode.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
[both laughing]

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
I win, I win!

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
I'm the greatest

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
spinning machine. Whoa!

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
[Candlemaker]

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
I feel your vexation, dear one.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Stop it.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
[Candlemaker]

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Every fruit must ripen.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
-Even you.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
-Stop it!

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Who are you talking to?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
No one.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Just... a friend.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
From inside your head?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I have lots of friends

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
in there.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Can I meet them?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Please, please, please?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
-You have to be polite.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
-I'm always polite.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
-Promise?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
-[Baby Doll] Uh-huh.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
You won't get scared?

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
No. Why? Are they scary?

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
No. But he's big and he smells

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
like a wet dog.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
[both giggling]

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
He was the first friend

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I ever made.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
He was my mama's friend first.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
She said that he knew I was in

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
her belly before she even did.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
When Mama was gone,

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
he followed me

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
to the new world

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
and he kept me safe.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
It was just the two of us

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
for a long time.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
[creature growling]

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
It's okay. He's nice.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I call him Manny.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
-[Manny snarls]

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
-[Baby Doll laughs]

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Wait, where'd he go?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Bring him back.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
I told you to be polite.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I was.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Dorothy!

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Come back!

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
[machine whirring]

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
They put stickers on us.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
And the puffy ones

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
are hard to get off.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Let me ask you something...

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Can you feel stuff?

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
Like cold stuff, hot stuff,

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
wet stuff, fuzzy stuff.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Tactile sensors. Yeah.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
My dad put them in

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
during my first surgery. Why?

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Chief thinks he could

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
rebuild my sense of touch.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Congratulations, man.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
He also said

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
it would take decades.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Which would be fine

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
if he wasn't dying.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Niles always finds a way.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
You know who else always

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
finds a way and isn't dying?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Your dad.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
You know how they say

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
the longer you're away

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
from people,

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
the harder it is to remember

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
what they look like?

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Well, I have that

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
but with sensations.

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
I used to hold my arm out

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
when it was raining,

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
feeling the drops hit my skin.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I remember doing that,

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
but not the feeling.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Running my hands

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
through my wife's hair.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
In my head,

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
I know it felt amazing,

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
but I don't know

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
at the same time.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
[sighs]

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
It's all floating away from me.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Hey.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Looks like you crashed.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Who are you?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
That's my father, Toby.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Dex...

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
this is Larry Trainor,

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
your grandfather.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Wow.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I'm not sure what to say.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Nice to meet you.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
[Larry] Works for me.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
-[Rita clears throat]

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
-Oh, uh, this is Rita.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
-My... dear friend.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
-Charmed.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
We're glad you're here.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
So, where should we start?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
It's quiet down here

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
without Baby Doll.

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
Oh, she's just

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
running and singing up-top,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
like she's always wanted.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I know you don't like anything

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
and you're not wild

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
about the attachments

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
we're making here,

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
but it's Baby Doll's job

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
to spin around in circles

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
and laugh till her sides hurt

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
and have real, genuine fun

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
making friends.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
If we didn't need that...

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
No, if the girl

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
didn't need that,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Baby Doll wouldn't exist.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Kids fight, Jane.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
And when that happens,

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
whose side do you think

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Dorothy's own fucking father's

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
gonna choose?

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Do you think Baby Doll

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
can handle that?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Dorothy!

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I'm sorry, Baby Doll.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
She was so tired from

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
such a fun day with you,

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
she fell asleep in my room,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
and she really does

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
need her rest.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Maybe you'd like to take

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
a little nap, too.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
-I'm not tired, I wanna play.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
-Oh.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Oh, you know,

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
I adore you, Baby Doll,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
but I really think I'm getting

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
-a little old

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
and creaky for play.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
-[whines]

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Fine.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I certainly hope

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
everyone's being polite

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
and good to the new

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
friends we've made.

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
I'd be very disappointed

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
if someone decided

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
to be a sour little girl.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
[Silas] You want me to install

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Cyborg technology in you?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
-That's the pitch.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
-[Cliff] I can tell

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
you're a man

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
who likes a challenge.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
What's a bigger challenge

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
than this guy?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
You told him

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
it was a good idea.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I told him nobody gets anything

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
if they don't ask.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Come on. Just imagine digging

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
through the mess Niles made,

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
then building a better me

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
and then shoving it

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
in Niles's face.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Man, you do not

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
break your stride.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
My tech is cutting-edge.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Niles's tech isn't even tech.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
It's spare parts.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
They're incompatible.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Like trying to connect

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
an iPhone to a telegraph.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
But if anyone could connect

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
those two, it's you!

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I mean, just look at

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
what you've done with Vic.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
-You're a genius.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
-Look, Dad...

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
I'm sorry for

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
what has happened to you.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
I truly am.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
But what I did for Victor...

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
was surgery.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
What Niles did to you?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
I could've started 1,000 times

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
and I still would've collapsed.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Wanted it too badly.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
To prove to Mother that

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
I could land a role on my own

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
and when I want something,

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
that's when that tumor

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
of a thought

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
bursts into my mind.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
You, uh...

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
You close with your mom?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
God, no.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
That witch died ages ago.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
But she haunts me.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
The things she did,

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
they haunt me.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Yeah. Uh...

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Oops, I, uh,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
forgot the ketchup.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Excuse me.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
[door closes]

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
Your father seems nice enough,

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
and I'm sure he means well.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
But don't ever let him

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
crush your spirit

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
and step on your dreams.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
-[cell phone ringing]

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
-Excuse me.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Hello. This is she--

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I see.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
I see.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I can.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
Yes. Thank you.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
That was Mickey Harris.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
[chuckles]

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
The writer-director

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
for the Cloverton

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
Community Players.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
It seems several of the cast

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
shared a tainted didgeridoo

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
while on vacation

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
and have come down with mono.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
They need me.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
I'm in the play. [laughs]

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Do you hear that, Mother?

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
I did it!

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
[Vic] What are you thinking

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
right now?

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
If you want to leave or not.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
-[Vic chuckles softly]

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
-It's okay. You can go.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Is this some kind of test?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
'Cause I don't wanna

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
do that no more.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Those files I gave you

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
were a warning,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
-about who I am.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
-Who you were.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
So you made some bad choices.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Everyone does.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
It's easy to make bad choices

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
when all you have

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
are bad options.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
There are only a few ways

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
to get out of here.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
That's getting mixed in some

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
bullshit on the street,

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
stumbling over a pot of gold

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
and going to college, or...

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
the military.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
There's nothing wrong

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
with the military.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Out of the three, I guess not.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Is that how you got these?

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
That's where it started.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
An IED outside of Baghdad.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
It was fucked-up.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
Next thing I know,

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
I'm in the hospital

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
thinking about

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
coming back here.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
So when Quorum approached me...

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
-You know them?

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
-I know they're into

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
some scandalous shit.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Yeah, well, they gave me

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
a different option.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I could go back home

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
and try to figure out my life,

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
or I could work

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
quiet missions for them.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
But quiet missions for Quorum,

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
they require something

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
more than human.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
They gave you enhancements.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
And when I

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
fucked up big enough,

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
they took them away.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Some of it was my fault.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
A lot of it was my fault.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
Worse than anything

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
in those files I sent you.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Power is one hell of a drug.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Someone once told me...

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
not to judge someone by

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
the worst things they've done.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
That's assuming

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
the worst is behind them.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Hey.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
You're not a bad person, Roni.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
I don't wanna be.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
[Larry] Can I help?

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
Uh, there's a box

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
over here for you.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
A couple of days

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
after the crash,

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
a few guys from your unit

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
cleaned out your locker.

38:12.000 --> 38:17.000
I thought you might want it if,

38:12.000 --> 38:17.000
you know, you came back.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
Gary never cried so hard

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
as he did over how much

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
you hated that thing.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
You should've seen

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
the look on his face when...

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
he saw that

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
you'd kept it anyway.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
[Larry] He nailed it.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
I was just too much

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
of an asshole to see it then.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
[sighs] This was John's.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
My ground crew chief.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
He was also my lover.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I'm gay.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
I wish I could have

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
admitted that to your mother.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
She always knew, but...

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
I wish I'd just given her that.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
A way out.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
But I was selfish...

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
and I was scared.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Thank you. Uh...

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
[exhales] Thank you,

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
for telling me.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Mom never mentioned it.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I guess it's my turn

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
to be honest.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
When they told us you'd finally

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
died from your injuries, she...

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
There were days of her just...

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
sprawled out

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
on the bedroom floor crying...

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Oh, Paul. I had no--

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
No, she tried to move on.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
I mean...

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
We bounced around.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
Guys came and went.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
Then one nut, Wayne,

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
he showed up.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
Filled her head with a lot

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
of crackpot nonsense.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Said you weren't really dead.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
Said it was a big

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
government cover-up.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
I left Gary behind to get

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
sucked into her world

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
and went out to follow

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
in your footsteps

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
thinking I was paying tribute

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
to my hero father.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
I kept telling myself,

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
"You just survive."

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Survive the tours,

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
survive watching my mother

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
drive herself to the grave,

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
survive Gary

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
taking his own life.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
And I was standing there...

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
By his casket...

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
And, God damn, if I didn't

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
feel a sense of peace.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
And there you were.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
I had no idea

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
I was carrying so much of it.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
The anger. The hatred.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
That's when I realized

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I didn't survive.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
No one survives Larry Trainor.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
[door slams]

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Larry!

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
[vehicles approaching]

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
[Larry gasps]

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
[agent] Capt. Trainor!

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
[Larry] What's going on?

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
I needed some answers

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
after Gary's funeral,

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
so I did some digging

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
all the way to

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
the Department of Defense.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
I'm sending you back

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
where you belong.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
I'm not going anywhere.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Negative Spirit, release.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
[Larry groans]

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
[agents groaning]

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
-What the hell is that?

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
-Dad, what's going on?

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Toby, get in the house.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
[guns firing]

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
[Paul] No!

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
Are you hurt?

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
Are you all right?

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
I'm fine.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
[Dex groaning]

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
-Dad!

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
-[Paul] Dex!

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
-[Dex groans]

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
-[Paul] Dex!

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
Dex. Dex.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
-What have you done?

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
-Larry.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
What have you done?

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
[gasps] Oh, my God. Paul...

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
You're a curse on this family.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
[Toby crying]

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
Larry, we have to go.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
[Larry] Paul...

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
-I'm so sorry.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
-Dad...

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
[gasps]

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Baby Doll?

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
I'm sorry, I don't feel like

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
playing right now.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
To be honest, Baby Doll,

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
I think I might be a little bit

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
too big for some of your games.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Your dad is a bad man.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
What?

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
He hurt me.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
He hurt everyone in this house

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
and that's why

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
everyone hates him.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
That's not true.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
It is. He's bad.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Worse than bad. He's evil.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
You're just hurt.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
And sometimes hurt feelings

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
make us say bad things.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Things that aren't true.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
I'm not lying.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I was being mean.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
I shouldn't have said I was

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
too big for games.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
-Why don't we play one,

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
before bed.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
-You're just--

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
You're the seeker,

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
I'm the hider.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
[both giggling]

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
[Baby Doll] Ready or not,

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
here I come!

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
[door slams]

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Dorothy.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Dorothy?

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Boo!

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
[gasps] Ow!
