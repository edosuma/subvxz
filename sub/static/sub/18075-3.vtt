[Man]
Ten years ago, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a military court...

00:05.146 --> 00:07.018
for a crime they didn"t commit.

00:07.104 --> 00:11.975
These men promptly escaped
from a maximum-security stockade
to the Los Angeles underground.

00:12.062 --> 00:15.676
Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

00:15.770 --> 00:19.826
If you have a problem, if no one else
can help, and if you can find them...

00:19.936 --> 00:21.927
maybe you can hire... the A-Team.

[Hannibal Narrating] In the hills
near the town of Redwood, California...

01:44.345 --> 01:49.049
five miles from the Oregon border,
a maniacal religious cult leader
named Martin James...

01:49.136 --> 01:52.999
has been keeping his youthful followers
isolated from the outside world...

01:53.094 --> 01:56.625
controlling their minds
by terror and intimidation.

01:56.719 --> 01:58.958
The A-Team has been hired
to rescue one of them...

01:59.052 --> 02:01.421
a girl named Sheila Rodgers.

02:18.300 --> 02:21.298
[Man Over Radio]
BrotherJohn, l"m going back
up the street and keep a lookout.

02:29.007 --> 02:30.914
Ma'am, allow me.

02:31.007 --> 02:33.921
Thank you for your kindness,
but they're sworn to vows of silence.

02:34.007 --> 02:36.874
Well, silence is golden, right?

02:41.423 --> 02:43.330
Boy, you know,
you really fill out that tunic.

02:43.422 --> 02:45.496
You used to be
a linebacker for the Rams?

02:45.589 --> 02:50.329
We do the Lord's work.
If you're here to taunt us, please don't.

02:50.422 --> 02:54.664
Nah, nah.
I'm just here to do a little fishin'.

02:54.755 --> 02:58.001
Well, uh, take care.

03:00.962 --> 03:02.869
Trouble?

03:02.962 --> 03:07.169
Let's pick up the supplies
and, uh, move along.

03:13.753 --> 03:17.200
- She's there.
- They got a lookout parked up the street.

03:17.294 --> 03:19.699
Better check on Murdock.
This thing's gotta go smooth.

03:19.794 --> 03:22.460
I only got him out of the V.A. Hospital
on a two-day pass.

03:22.544 --> 03:25.328
Whiskey Lead, this is Whiskey Deuce.
We got a bogey at 5.00.

03:25.418 --> 03:27.325
He's all mine, Kemosabe.

03:27.418 --> 03:30.997
- [lmitating Gunfire]
- [Hannibal Over Radio]
Murdock, you there?

03:31.084 --> 03:35.492
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I be here, Hannibal.
How we doin', muchacho?

03:35.584 --> 03:39.281
We're gonna make a try for her.
Better warm up your birdie.

03:39.375 --> 03:43.499
- We could be coming in hot.
- Roger.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.988
Is she there, Mr Smith?
Is my daughter with them?

03:46.083 --> 03:49.081
Clear this transmission.
She's there.

03:50.749 --> 03:52.740
It's gonna be okay.

03:54.082 --> 03:57.613
Now, those guys are muscle-bound,
and they got a backup.

03:57.707 --> 04:01.072
We"re gonna have to do this fast.
Let"s go. Here"s your blood.

04:01.165 --> 04:03.285
Try not to swallow it
when you put it in your mouth.

04:03.373 --> 04:06.324
I want it to pop when I hit ya.
Oh. Nice.

04:08.914 --> 04:10.988
- Ready, darling?
- Yep.

04:11.081 --> 04:13.948
- But I'm really nervous.
- You should"ve stayed back at the paper.

04:14.039 --> 04:16.278
You're the one
who wanted to come along.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.449
- [Dog Barking]
- [Kids Laughing, Chattering]

04:46.535 --> 04:49.983
- Now don't bust my chops, huh?
- Shh!

04:50.077 --> 04:53.323
- For heaven's sakes, Dwayne!
- I should've left you in Stockton.

04:53.410 --> 04:56.407
You know campin' in the wilderness
ain't like life at Club Med.

04:56.493 --> 04:58.815
I told you that before we left,
but, no!

04:58.909 --> 05:01.990
- You gotta complain and complain and...
- Hush, Dwayne! People are lookin' at us!

05:02.076 --> 05:04.742
What, them? Don't worry about them.
They ain't gonna say nothin'.

05:04.825 --> 05:08.321
They took a vow of silence.
Right, kids?

05:08.408 --> 05:10.731
- Shh!
- I think you are crude and disgusting!

05:10.825 --> 05:13.278
- Really? Really?
- All you do is shout at me!
"The pancakes are lumpy!"

05:13.366 --> 05:15.273
- The pancakes are lumpy.
- "The orange juice is too pulpy!"

05:15.366 --> 05:18.115
Oh, shut up, Sue Ellen!
Just shut your damn yap!

05:18.199 --> 05:21.113
You've been braying about coffee
all morning, so why don't we
get the coffee, hon?

05:21.199 --> 05:23.947
- Get the coffee
and we'll get out of here, okay?
- Okay!

05:24.032 --> 05:27.444
Allow me to assist you, my dear.

05:27.531 --> 05:30.198
Thank God there's
one nice man in town.

05:30.281 --> 05:32.485
Hey, Wyatt, drift, okay?

05:32.573 --> 05:34.563
When we need the dumb waiter,
we'll ring the bell.

05:34.656 --> 05:37.357
Hey, friend, you got a big mouth.
Why don't you shut it...

05:37.447 --> 05:39.817
before I take a real dislike to you?

05:39.905 --> 05:42.026
Well, well, well.

05:42.113 --> 05:45.064
You know, you showed up
at just the right time, Wyatt.

05:45.155 --> 05:47.477
I've been wantin'
to hit somebody all mornin'.

05:54.570 --> 05:57.059
We're leaving now.

06:12.069 --> 06:14.308
Get the girl!

06:14.402 --> 06:16.476
Hey!

06:31.025 --> 06:33.016
They've got Sister Sheila!

06:36.733 --> 06:39.019
Go!

06:56.106 --> 06:58.096
Your father hired us
to rescue you.

06:58.189 --> 07:01.685
Thank God.
I thought I'd never get out of there.

07:01.772 --> 07:03.976
You just broke your vow of silence.

07:04.064 --> 07:07.843
And it feels wonderful!

07:07.938 --> 07:11.848
You don't know... I've been trying
to get in touch with my father
for 18 months.

07:11.938 --> 07:15.801
But they read our mail,
and they censored it.

07:15.896 --> 07:21.133
It's like a nightmare out there.
It's like a... like a prison camp.

07:21.229 --> 07:25.269
And Martin James...
he's a madman.

07:26.353 --> 07:29.137
You're safe now...
I think.

07:29.228 --> 07:31.798
You know, those blood capsules
are really realistic.

07:31.894 --> 07:34.975
You think so? I swallowed it
when I threw the first punch.

07:35.061 --> 07:37.975
- Hannibal split the inside of my lip.
- I'm sorry, kid.

07:38.060 --> 07:41.805
- You walked into it.
- Oh, no. There goes another cap.

07:41.893 --> 07:43.683
Why'd you gotta go
bust Faceman in the lip for?

07:43.768 --> 07:45.889
You know if you make him ugly,
that"ll mess up our meal ticket.

07:45.976 --> 07:49.223
Won't be able to get
no more good hotel rooms.

07:52.517 --> 07:54.673
They're gonna be on us, man.

08:13.015 --> 08:15.634
Hey, Face,
those blood capsules work great!

08:15.723 --> 08:17.678
- Keep your head down!
- Hannibal knocked out his cap!

08:17.765 --> 08:23.464
- Hannibal, without the Faceman's smile,
we get lousy hotels!
- Get that bird off the ground!

08:23.556 --> 08:25.546
Hurry up! Hurry up!

08:28.014 --> 08:30.004
Go! Go!

08:51.886 --> 08:54.173
Hit the floor!

08:59.969 --> 09:01.959
She got away clean.

09:02.052 --> 09:04.422
I love it when
a plan comes together.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.963
Get out of that van
with your hands up.

09:07.052 --> 09:09.125
We need a new plan,
right now!

09:09.218 --> 09:12.583
I believe it was General Grant
that said...

09:12.676 --> 09:16.088
"When you're surrounded
and outnumbered...

09:16.176 --> 09:19.671
- there's only one way out."
- Yeah? So what is it?

09:19.759 --> 09:23.622
- [Hannibal] Surrender.
- Throw out your weapons!

09:23.717 --> 09:26.122
Now come out of there
one at a time...

09:26.216 --> 09:30.459
with your hands on your heads,
or we will blow you sinners away!

09:30.549 --> 09:32.789
Say your prayers.

09:40.923 --> 09:43.458
[Helicopter Approaching]

09:48.256 --> 09:50.744
[Gunfire]

09:52.547 --> 09:54.454
Get us some help, Murdock.

09:54.547 --> 09:57.249
- Golly, they got guns!
- What are you doin'?

09:57.338 --> 10:00.952
That's my unit down there, man.
You gotta go with your unit, you know?

10:01.046 --> 10:02.953
We can't take a chance
on getting shot.

10:03.046 --> 10:05.960
We can't, but as soon as
I get you guys home, I can.

10:06.046 --> 10:09.991
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you so much.

10:10.087 --> 10:12.871
Martin James, he's...

10:12.962 --> 10:16.043
I-I know, baby. I know.
It's gonna be all right.

10:18.878 --> 10:23.784
I will fear no evil. Thy rod and thy AR-15
shall comfort me, right, guys?

10:28.919 --> 10:30.909
[Horn Honks]

10:46.833 --> 10:49.322
- Hey, Face.
- Yes?

10:49.417 --> 10:52.912
What do you suppose
these guys wear under their skirts?

10:52.999 --> 10:55.950
Gee, I-I don't know.

10:56.041 --> 10:58.446
Half slips? Ooh!

10:58.541 --> 11:00.661
Garter belts? Ooh!

11:00.749 --> 11:03.995
I think you wear panty hose.

11:53.369 --> 11:57.611
The devil is a she-wolf
who attacks the lamb in darkness.

11:57.701 --> 12:00.616
These sinners keep comin'.

12:00.701 --> 12:02.857
How long...

12:05.284 --> 12:07.488
How long can l...

12:11.450 --> 12:13.571
I've stopped dreaming.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.567
I used to dream, and now I've stopped.

12:18.658 --> 12:22.237
Welcome to Camp Awongo.

12:38.697 --> 12:41.020
Who is that?

12:42.489 --> 12:44.396
He doesn't look like
the swimming instructor.

12:46.155 --> 12:48.311
What should I do with them?

12:52.696 --> 12:55.315
Of course, they'll be made to pay.

12:55.404 --> 12:59.350
[Chuckles]
I mean, somebody has to pay.

13:01.195 --> 13:03.150
Somebody has to.

13:15.777 --> 13:18.479
Take the transgressors
to "C" building.

13:37.275 --> 13:39.312
Pray for your souls...

13:39.400 --> 13:41.769
that they should be received.

13:49.566 --> 13:51.521
Sweep the place.

13:51.607 --> 13:54.012
I thought these guys
were supposed to be religious.

13:54.107 --> 13:57.686
[Hannibal] This has nothing to do with
Christianity. This has to do with power.

13:57.773 --> 14:00.687
He"s a crazy cultist
terrorizing kids.

14:09.230 --> 14:11.897
[Snapping Fingers]

14:20.562 --> 14:23.229
[Whistles Loudly]

14:24.270 --> 14:27.102
It's a sin to eavesdrop, guys.

14:31.645 --> 14:34.133
So what do we do now?
How do we get out of here?

14:34.228 --> 14:37.640
Well, first off, we may not.
We could die right here.

14:37.727 --> 14:41.886
Accept that.
Anything else is just very good luck.

14:41.977 --> 14:44.844
- Figure you're dead. Can you do that?
- Are you kidding?

14:44.935 --> 14:48.431
Look, Amy, we all gotta accept death.

14:48.518 --> 14:52.215
That way, we don't have no fear.
It gives us the edge.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.880
- Well, I don't think I can.
- [Face] Try.

14:54.976 --> 14:57.298
You gotta try.

14:57.392 --> 15:01.006
Okay, let"s put it together.
B.A.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.340
Okay, the motor pool
is on the south side of the building.

15:03.433 --> 15:05.803
Looks like they make
their own electricity.

15:05.891 --> 15:09.008
Their generator"s on the east wall.
No phones. One radio antenna...

15:09.099 --> 15:11.173
next to that building
with the crazy-looking temple.

15:11.266 --> 15:16.006
One TV antenna
next to the building in the middle,
and that's probably Martin James's house.

15:16.099 --> 15:18.172
- You saw all that?
- Face.

15:18.265 --> 15:21.097
They got a barbed wire bunker
to the south and a guard tower beside it.

15:21.182 --> 15:23.421
Mess hall"s next to the fence.

15:23.515 --> 15:26.465
Barracks are about 10-man deals.
Sixteen on the left, 10 on the right.

15:26.556 --> 15:28.298
The guys in the brown robes
are the soldiers.

15:28.389 --> 15:31.885
Mostly AR-15s, sidearms,
hunting knives.

15:31.972 --> 15:36.048
It"s a perimeter structure.
One way in, one way out.
Your basic Fort Apache layout.

15:36.138 --> 15:38.461
Add to that an armory
right inside the gate.

15:38.555 --> 15:41.387
Not the greatest place in the world,
but nobody said they were perfect.

15:41.471 --> 15:44.303
- So what do we do?
- We wait.

15:44.388 --> 15:46.508
We try to stay loose.

15:46.596 --> 15:49.262
The next move's up to them.

15:58.595 --> 16:02.256
I'm scared.

16:02.344 --> 16:04.251
I'm really scared.

16:05.344 --> 16:08.709
We've been through
some tough ones before, kid.

16:08.802 --> 16:12.878
North of Da Nang, 50 clicks from the
D.M.Z., we all got taken by Charlie.

16:12.968 --> 16:16.380
But we made our opportunities.
We got loose.

16:16.468 --> 16:19.915
That's why you gotta,
right now, accept death.

16:21.092 --> 16:24.209
It, uh, calms you.

16:33.966 --> 16:36.632
Don't be afraid.
I won't let nothin' hurt you.

16:41.299 --> 16:44.332
She ain't gonna be able to do it,
Hannibal. We gotta help her through it.

16:44.423 --> 16:46.579
Okay, you're right.

16:50.673 --> 16:53.706
Amy.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.372
Now, do as we say.

17:07.296 --> 17:10.875
- Listen to us.
- I don't wanna die.

17:10.962 --> 17:14.126
Neither does Martin James.

17:47.917 --> 17:50.666
- You can get back from here.
- I think we should call the authorities.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.499
- No! No, no, no, no.
- No, I mean police or National Guard.

17:53.583 --> 17:57.079
No, you can't do that.
Remember what Hannibal told you.

17:57.166 --> 18:00.994
We're wanted.
You send in the military or the cops,
and the A-Team winds up in jail.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.784
Yeah, but they could die.
If what Sheila says is true...

18:03.874 --> 18:05.781
they are madmen with machine guns.

18:05.874 --> 18:07.781
We'd rather die than wind up in jail.
Leave it be.

18:07.874 --> 18:10.741
- I'll find a way to help them.
- You're really going back up there?

18:10.832 --> 18:12.739
It's my unit, man.
You gotta stay with your unit.

18:12.831 --> 18:15.533
Right now, I'm gonna see if
I can pick me up some firepower.

18:17.914 --> 18:22.157
Just had a mountain cave in
on the main shaft. I need some help.

18:25.705 --> 18:29.366
- Help! I need some help!
- Help. All right.

18:46.286 --> 18:48.691
Have you heard this poem?

18:48.786 --> 18:53.277
"The time of right
is the goal of the fight.

18:53.369 --> 18:58.073
"The Lord will prevail...

18:58.160 --> 19:00.613
where evil shall wail."

19:00.702 --> 19:02.609
Have you heard this poem?

19:02.702 --> 19:05.818
"Hickory dickory dock.
The mouse ran up the clock.

19:05.910 --> 19:09.571
"The clock struck one.
Down he run.

19:09.659 --> 19:11.650
You smell worse than my socks."

19:11.742 --> 19:13.365
[Laughing]

19:15.284 --> 19:18.530
Go on. Go on.
Have all the fun you want, my friend...

19:18.617 --> 19:21.484
"cause my plans for you
will not change.

19:21.575 --> 19:25.319
I mean, there's no appeal
from my justice.

19:25.408 --> 19:28.986
There's no justice. One way or another,
we all hoe weeds for the county.

19:29.074 --> 19:31.988
You keep comin'.

19:32.074 --> 19:35.155
It happens once, maybe twice,
I say, "Okay."

19:35.240 --> 19:38.688
People that got money,
they like to finance things.

19:38.781 --> 19:43.734
You come,
you take the children of Jamestown.

19:43.822 --> 19:46.026
You take the novitiates
from the altar.

19:46.114 --> 19:48.151
You try your sorcerer's song.

19:48.239 --> 19:50.359
You sing it loudly.

19:50.447 --> 19:54.985
You take not from me,
from yourselves...

19:55.071 --> 19:57.311
in light...

19:57.404 --> 20:00.734
in life, in darkness.

20:00.821 --> 20:03.902
It's good. Tighten it up.
Cut the stuff about the song...

20:03.987 --> 20:06.558
and it could play
on public television.

20:06.654 --> 20:11.310
I find you guilty
of crimes against the word...

20:11.403 --> 20:16.190
and I sentence you
to a trial of worthiness.

20:16.278 --> 20:20.733
The Lord shall test them. They shall
walk through the valley of his wrath.

20:20.819 --> 20:24.314
Now you're beginning to walk
through the valley of my wrath, Preacher.

20:24.402 --> 20:27.483
Take them.
Take them and test them in my name...

20:27.568 --> 20:30.685
for I am the god of this age.

20:30.776 --> 20:32.683
I rest not until my work is done.

20:32.776 --> 20:35.062
Seven days and seven nights.

20:35.151 --> 20:38.516
The new world
will be built by the chosen!

20:38.609 --> 20:40.848
This man's a pothead, Hannibal.

20:40.942 --> 20:44.023
He's high on smack
or speedballin' or somethin'.

20:44.108 --> 20:46.679
He wear them glasses so
can't nobody see his eyes.

20:46.775 --> 20:50.105
Now you have all spoken
and defied him.

20:50.191 --> 20:53.354
More to the point,
the chopper got away.

20:53.441 --> 20:57.304
You"re gonna be up to your shades
in National Guard in an hour or two.

20:57.399 --> 20:59.306
You better cool it, Preacher.

20:59.398 --> 21:03.308
I will have my vengeance!

21:03.398 --> 21:06.763
I will seek payment,
for you are mine...

21:06.856 --> 21:09.095
and I am his!

21:09.189 --> 21:12.685
- Take them.
- Nuttier than an almond bar.

21:14.314 --> 21:18.141
And they were sent out into the fields...

21:18.230 --> 21:20.434
to be tested.

21:20.521 --> 21:22.595
The evil will be cast out...

21:22.688 --> 21:24.643
and given 500 paces...

21:24.729 --> 21:27.182
before the forces of good
will pursue them.

21:27.271 --> 21:29.344
The devil was their choice!

21:29.437 --> 21:32.104
Take off your shoes.

21:32.187 --> 21:34.307
You will wear the shoes
of a sinner.

21:34.395 --> 21:38.519
Hey, these are $600
ostrich skin boots, Jack.

21:38.603 --> 21:41.766
Tell you what.
Let me hang onto 'em...

21:41.853 --> 21:44.423
and if the Maker wants 'em,
I'll see to it he gets 'em.

21:47.060 --> 21:51.717
- Put them on.
- Damn, these boots are hard to get.

22:04.059 --> 22:06.761
- Let the trial begin.
- Face.

22:11.475 --> 22:14.177
I'm not through with you, tinsel-head.
I'll be back.

22:18.599 --> 22:21.466
- [Engine Starts]
- In the name of our Lord...

22:21.557 --> 22:24.128
and on my word...

22:24.223 --> 22:27.636
commit the souls
of those sinners to your keeping!

22:27.723 --> 22:30.176
- Now!
- Go into their world...

22:30.265 --> 22:33.298
armed with the sword
of our saviour...

22:33.389 --> 22:36.422
for he who hath cut out
the sickness of the beast...

22:36.514 --> 22:38.421
will be rewarded...

22:38.514 --> 22:42.258
in a world without end!

22:42.347 --> 22:44.420
Amen!

22:59.970 --> 23:01.960
Let's go!

23:06.094 --> 23:09.045
- [Gunfire]
- Come on, Amy! Come on! Run!

23:09.136 --> 23:11.126
- I can't!
- Run or die, girl!

23:30.842 --> 23:34.005
[Hannibal]
B.A., hide in that ditch. Come on!

23:52.923 --> 23:54.914
Stay low.

24:13.046 --> 24:16.494
Go around and pick 'em up
on the low road. They've gotta
come out of here someplace.

24:16.587 --> 24:18.578
We'll go east.

24:19.795 --> 24:22.544
Reverend, we lost 'em.

24:24.378 --> 24:29.414
God's work has no room for failure.

24:29.503 --> 24:33.827
His will be done.
It will be done!

24:42.752 --> 24:44.742
Hold it.

24:46.460 --> 24:50.121
- Okay, Face, take the point.
- Got ya.

24:50.209 --> 24:52.413
Follow this streambed.
Get up over that ridge.

24:52.501 --> 24:54.953
I'll keep my eye on ya.
If you see anything, give me a signal.

24:55.042 --> 24:58.703
- Right.
- Now, stay low. We keep separated.

24:58.792 --> 25:02.832
Count three before you follow me.
B.A., you got the rear.

25:30.830 --> 25:34.491
I went as far as the trees. The preacher's
got one lookout at the farm.

25:34.580 --> 25:38.443
But that's all they need. Can't get
anywhere near him without being spotted.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.445
We gotta bring him to us.

25:40.538 --> 25:43.108
One of us can make it
to that giant oak tree over there...

25:43.204 --> 25:47.280
and move from treetop to treetop until
we get to the one by the farmhouse.

25:47.370 --> 25:49.277
Those branches
don't look that strong to me.

25:50.495 --> 25:52.734
It's gotta be
the lightest one of us.

25:55.369 --> 25:58.735
- It pays to stay fit.
- Well, I'm really the lightest.

25:58.827 --> 26:00.699
No, you gotta be the bait.

26:00.786 --> 26:05.359
We gotta do something
to get that jerk within range.
He'd be suspicious if it was a man.

26:05.452 --> 26:07.905
Let's hear it for women's rights.

26:19.159 --> 26:21.777
Hey!

26:51.989 --> 26:54.442
- Face! Face, are you okay?
- [Groaning]

26:56.363 --> 26:58.271
How many fingers
am I holding up?

26:58.363 --> 27:00.437
Blue.

27:00.530 --> 27:02.983
- Tree. [Muttering]
- Give me a hand.

27:06.321 --> 27:08.228
- How bad is he?
- I think he's okay.

27:08.321 --> 27:11.271
- Oh, no. Not again.
- Huh?

27:11.362 --> 27:13.399
What?

27:13.487 --> 27:15.394
- Oh.
- Don't worry, kid.

27:15.487 --> 27:17.773
- I'll put it in with the other.
- Oh, good.

27:22.944 --> 27:27.518
Please. Now, please. We've done nothing
to you. Why don't you just leave us alone?

27:27.610 --> 27:30.478
- We need help.
- What's going on? Who are you people?

27:30.568 --> 27:33.436
We're being chased by that maniac
Reverend James. He's trying to kill us.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.517
We need your help.
He's injured.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.932
Look, there's nothing we can do
to help you. We don't even have a phone.

27:38.026 --> 27:40.940
My daughter and I have lived here
for the past five years alone.

27:41.026 --> 27:43.976
We comin' in, Jack!
Now get the first aid kit
before you have to use it on yourself!

27:44.067 --> 27:46.555
I'm sorry.
I'm just worried about my daughter.

27:46.650 --> 27:50.513
Reverend James would kill us for sure
if he knew we were helping
one of his unchosen.

27:50.608 --> 27:52.515
What do you have to do
with Reverend James?

27:52.608 --> 27:54.977
Well, his men come
and collect part of my crops.

27:55.066 --> 27:59.273
They don't like to go into Redwood
and mingle with the town folk, so he
does most of his food buying right here.

27:59.357 --> 28:03.102
- If I didn't help him,
he said he'd kill us.
- [Allen] We understand.

28:03.190 --> 28:05.311
Believe me,
we know how crazy he is.

28:05.398 --> 28:07.638
But we need your help.
He's out there trying to murder us.

28:07.731 --> 28:10.101
We'd like to avoid that if we could.

28:10.190 --> 28:12.393
Well, like I said,
I've got no phone.

28:12.481 --> 28:15.728
- [B.A.] You got any weapons?
- [Man] Nothing.

28:15.814 --> 28:18.267
[Hannibal]
B.A., we"ll have to start scrounging.

28:18.355 --> 28:20.642
l"m sorry, but we"ll have to go through
some of your things.

28:20.730 --> 28:23.218
It won"t take those rogues long
to figure out where we are.

28:25.021 --> 28:27.474
Amy, how's Face?

28:28.938 --> 28:30.893
Oh, I think he's much better.

28:42.020 --> 28:45.634
Hey, Jack, I thought you was a farmer.
This place looks like a junkyard.

28:45.728 --> 28:48.298
Well, I've turned a lot of junk into art.
It's what I do.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.301
- What's in the barn?
- My studio.

28:50.394 --> 28:52.598
Studio? You make movies too?

28:52.685 --> 28:54.925
What you call them,
those art movies?

28:55.018 --> 28:57.092
- It's where I sculpt.
- Mind if we take a look?

28:57.185 --> 29:00.266
- No, not at all.
- [Dog Barking]

29:03.309 --> 29:06.058
- What are in these tanks?
- Acetylene and oxygen.

29:06.142 --> 29:08.216
There's a year's supply.
Just had 'em shipped in.

29:08.309 --> 29:11.141
- Got any steel pipe?
- Yeah.

29:11.225 --> 29:13.678
Have you got a hot-water heater?

29:13.767 --> 29:15.722
There's one in the basement,
but it doesn't work.

29:15.808 --> 29:18.722
Great. B.A.

29:20.599 --> 29:24.095
I want you to get that Jeep.
Make sure it's full of gas.

29:24.182 --> 29:27.927
We're gonna wire
a couple of these in the back of it,
put the steel pipe on top of that.

29:28.015 --> 29:30.504
I think you can use it as a swivel.

29:30.598 --> 29:34.805
- Right. Beautiful.
- I'm gonna take a look
at your hot-water heater.

29:34.890 --> 29:38.006
No, I don't think
you should be moving around much.

29:38.098 --> 29:40.005
Why don't you just stay on the couch?

29:40.097 --> 29:42.550
Nah, it's just a flesh wound.

29:42.639 --> 29:44.843
That's a fresh one.

29:44.930 --> 29:48.627
- Hey, he's really hurt, you know.
- You're the doctor.

29:48.722 --> 29:51.470
Amy, grab a screwdriver
and get that radio out of the Jeep.

29:51.555 --> 29:54.387
- And get some paint
and get to work on the roof.
- Got it.

29:54.471 --> 29:57.587
Uh, Face?

29:57.679 --> 30:02.585
If you feel well enough,
I've got a hot-water heater
I need to move out of the basement.

30:02.679 --> 30:06.506
Oh, I really don't think
he should move around much.

30:06.595 --> 30:08.834
Aw.

30:08.928 --> 30:11.251
Move it, Lieutenant!

30:13.594 --> 30:16.047
No rest for the weary.

30:17.260 --> 30:19.251
I'll be back.

30:29.968 --> 30:32.124
Did you get it?

30:32.217 --> 30:34.208
Whoo!

30:36.550 --> 30:39.382
But... But I don't think
I'd better let you take this...

30:39.467 --> 30:41.374
unless you have an order for it.

30:41.466 --> 30:44.796
- You know, the state boys,
they count all this stuff.
- I got 12 miners stuck in the main shaft!

30:44.883 --> 30:46.790
If we don't blow an airhole down to 'em,
they eat it!

30:46.883 --> 30:50.082
- You tell that to the state!
Open the door.
- Every stick they count!

30:50.174 --> 30:53.290
And if we don't come up with all of it,
we're gonna lose our permit.

30:53.382 --> 30:56.463

Would you at least sign this thing?

You know where I had to go to get this?
I'm doin' you a favour.

31:03.173 --> 31:05.080
You gotta at least
sign this thing for me.

31:05.172 --> 31:07.791
I'll keep track of every stick I use,
and I'll return the box. Open the door.

31:07.880 --> 31:10.120
- Thank you.
- Return the box?

31:10.214 --> 31:13.128

if that would do me any good.
- Blades! Blades!

of taking a shower, Colonel?

31:46.210 --> 31:48.449
No, I'm thinking about
giving one.

with wheels on it in for me, will ya?

31:52.626 --> 31:54.617

I'd get in that Jeep...

does not play nice.

if he played nice.

- Besides, I'm goin' back to his place.
- What for?

33:41.782 --> 33:46.273
He's got over a hundred kids
he's terrorizing up there that need help.

- I don't know.
I've never done it before.

But Hannibal says it will.

- Of course it's gonna work.

You're gonna get 50 feet from that

Over.

Over.

Yeah, I hear you just fine, Face.

- I got us some aerial support too.

37:53.632 --> 37:56.583
- Are we intact down here?
- Yeah. Hannibal and B.A.
went to sting the monster.

37:56.674 --> 38:00.667

- Dynamite. Beautiful, pretty red ones.

38:00.757 --> 38:02.877
- Yeah?
- You guys are incredible.
You really came back.

38:02.965 --> 38:05.287
Of course he did.
He wouldn't leave us in trouble.

You really should be lying down, you know.
- Mm-hmm.

40:36.866 --> 40:39.022
## [Humming]

40:47.990 --> 40:49.364
Yeah!

40:51.115 --> 40:53.022
They will perish!

40:59.656 --> 41:02.772
Throw down your weapons
and put your hands on your head...

41:02.864 --> 41:05.233
or I'll turn you all
into burning bushes!

41:08.280 --> 41:10.898
Drop it, Reverend,
or you'll be medium rare.

41:48.026 --> 41:51.889
Why'd you do it?
I mean, I just can't figure it out.

41:51.984 --> 41:55.563
- Did it for the jazz.
- The jazz?

41:55.650 --> 41:57.937
Yeah.
The, uh, the jazz.

41:58.025 --> 42:00.809
It's-lt's-lt's like walking a tightrope...

42:00.900 --> 42:04.100
a thousand feet up
without a net.

42:04.191 --> 42:09.772
The wind starts you swayin'.
See, you know that at any second
you could fall.

42:09.857 --> 42:11.764
You mean the thrill of danger?

42:11.857 --> 42:13.764
Yeah. Yeah.

42:13.857 --> 42:16.262
Only, you see,
it's more than that.

42:16.357 --> 42:18.430
It's knowing...

42:18.523 --> 42:20.099
knowing that, uh...

42:20.190 --> 42:23.271
Well, feeling that
you're quicker than...

42:23.356 --> 42:27.681
Well, l...
I don't wanna sound corny, but, uh...

42:27.772 --> 42:29.928
it's knowing that
you're risking everything...

42:30.022 --> 42:34.726
- life, liberty, happiness...
- ## [Whistling]

42:34.813 --> 42:37.432
Knowing that at every second...

42:37.521 --> 42:40.270
you have to be quicker, stronger...

42:40.354 --> 42:43.103
faster and tough.

42:43.187 --> 42:46.268
Oh, yeah, tough as steel.

42:46.354 --> 42:49.221
- Tougher than steel.
- Excuse me.

42:49.312 --> 42:51.717
I'm... Excuse me.
Face, I looked and I looked...

42:51.812 --> 42:55.852
and I couldn't find Miss Trudy's Body
Treatment for Bubble Bath anywhere.

42:55.936 --> 42:57.843
- What?
- Bubble bath?

42:57.936 --> 42:59.843
Oh, yeah. Faceman loves bubble bath.
He lives in it.

42:59.936 --> 43:02.684
- He says it makes your skin real...
- All right, all right. Murdock?

43:10.476 --> 43:13.557
National Guard's just up the road.
They'll be here any minute.

43:15.393 --> 43:17.762
Stand by to move out, B.A.

43:17.851 --> 43:22.673
Thank you. You know, you've rescued us
from one year of terror.

43:22.767 --> 43:27.056
Well, no matter what they say,
forget about our names
and our descriptions, all right?

43:27.141 --> 43:29.048
If that's the way
you want it, friend.

43:29.141 --> 43:33.181
I stopped dreaming.
I don't dream any more.

43:33.266 --> 43:35.256
l...

43:37.807 --> 43:40.923
I knew then it was over.

43:41.015 --> 43:45.589
Hang on tight, Reverend.
It's a bumpy road from here on.

43:52.389 --> 43:55.138
[Hannibal]
Okay, let's go.

43:55.222 --> 43:57.675
Coming, Lieutenant?

44:19.095 --> 44:21.417
Sir? Sir? Bless you.

44:21.511 --> 44:25.291
- You saved us from a madman.
- You're welcome.
