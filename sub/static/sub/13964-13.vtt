00:00.001 --> 00:02.301
[NARRATOR]
Previously on<i> Dark Matter.</i>

00:02.302 --> 00:04.602
[SIX] You go back and retake
the throne, you inherit a war.

00:04.605 --> 00:07.172
[FOUR] A war that I can win
with the blink drive.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.774
But we'll never let that happen.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.376
We'll see about that.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.011
[HANSMEED]
Your brother is dead.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.179
He cut his throat
with this knife.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.381
Do you recognize it?

00:15.383 --> 00:17.216
[HIRO]
I renounce the throne

00:17.218 --> 00:20.686
and step down in favor
of Zairon's rightful ruler.

00:22.289 --> 00:23.372
Four!

00:23.373 --> 00:24.456
[FOUR]
My name is not Four.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.458
I am Ishida Ryo.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.128
Emperor of Zairon.

00:30.765 --> 00:33.699
[WOMAN]The diplomatic summit
on Eos 7 is in two weeks.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.035
It's going to be tense.
What do we know?

00:37.805 --> 00:39.705
Traugott is gonna
put forward a resolution

00:39.707 --> 00:42.274
to introduce three
new members to the Council.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.810
Ferrous will naturally oppose.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.445
Of course.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.580
If the resolution is defeated,

00:48.582 --> 00:50.249
well, we believe Traugott
will have no choice

00:50.251 --> 00:52.151
but to accept the results.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.286
However, if it passes,

00:54.288 --> 00:57.222
we believe Ferrous
will disavow the results

00:57.224 --> 00:59.691
and pull their support
from the Council.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.294
In other words, they're
prepared to go to war.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.397
We have recently
discovered that Traugott

01:05.399 --> 01:06.832
is trying to make secret deals

01:06.834 --> 01:09.234
with both Vanguard
and Volkov-Rusi.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.670
Now if they succeed, they'll
have all the votes they need.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.006
In which case,

01:14.007 --> 01:16.341
our best course of action
would be to abstain.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.343
Try to maintain
a position of neutrality

01:18.345 --> 01:19.478
for as long as possible.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.746
And how long would that be?

01:20.748 --> 01:23.082
Well, once open
hostilities break out,

01:23.084 --> 01:25.117
not more than a couple of weeks.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.219
But that might be just enough
time to make the difference.

01:27.221 --> 01:30.322
[alarm blaring]

01:30.324 --> 01:31.723
Commander.

01:31.725 --> 01:32.891
What's going on?

01:32.892 --> 01:34.058
[OFFICER]
An unidentified ship

01:34.059 --> 01:35.225
has breached
our defensive perimeter.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.362
We have to get both of you
to a secure location.

01:37.364 --> 01:41.100
[alarm blaring]

01:41.102 --> 01:42.501
Wait.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.237
[TRUFFAULT scoffs]

01:45.239 --> 01:47.106
You can stand down.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.540
They're not here to attack us.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.576
How do you know?

01:50.578 --> 01:52.611
They're old friends.

02:08.329 --> 02:11.697
[TRUFFAULT] Well, you certainly
have a flair for the dramatic.

02:11.699 --> 02:14.366
You're lucky my people didn't
blast you outta the sky.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.367
[THREE]
You think so?

02:15.369 --> 02:17.803
We're here to talk
about Eos 7.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.706
Are we? What about it?

02:20.708 --> 02:22.207
[THREE]
It's all over the news.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.308
Diplomatic summit.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.743
Bigwigs from
all the corporations.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.311
You gonna be there?

02:26.313 --> 02:29.715
I will be a member of
the Mikkei delegation, yes.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.750
[TWO] Eos 7 is a pretty
remote location.

02:31.752 --> 02:35.320
I have to assume
that's deliberate.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.356
Let me explain
something to you.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.790
The Council of Corporations

02:38.792 --> 02:42.394
has not held a face-to-face
meeting in over ten years.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.428
Do you care to guess why?

02:43.430 --> 02:45.330
You don't trust each other.

02:45.332 --> 02:48.700
You're not as dumb as you look.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.336
Which leads me to wonder what
could possibly make you think

02:51.338 --> 02:53.372
that I would divulge
security measures

02:53.374 --> 02:57.776
about a rather historic meeting
to a group of wanted criminals.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.244
[TWO]
You're gonna want our help,

02:59.246 --> 03:00.812
because there's
a significant probability

03:00.814 --> 03:03.315
that the summit on Eos 7
will come under attack.

03:03.317 --> 03:06.385
The most likely scenario
involves some kind of bomb.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.686
That station will be destroyed.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.288
Everyone on board
will be killed,

03:09.290 --> 03:12.691
and the result will be
all-out corporate war.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.194
And how do you know this?

03:17.431 --> 03:18.630
[NYX sighs]

03:18.631 --> 03:19.830
[THE ANDROID]
Nyx, this is the bridge.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.733
Go ahead.

03:21.734 --> 03:23.634
[THE ANDROID] I have an incoming
subspace transmission for you.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.237
It's from Zairon.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.843
Patch it through to my room.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.514
[computer beeps]

03:35.516 --> 03:37.883
[RYO]
Nyx.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.918
It's good to see you again.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.820
I don't think
I can say the same.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.589
I wanted to apologize.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.791
The circumstances the
last time we saw each other

03:45.793 --> 03:46.992
were not ideal.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.461
You mean that bloodbath
at the royal court?

03:49.463 --> 03:51.463
Where you murdered
all those people?

03:51.465 --> 03:55.334
[RYO] My brother and stepmother
had to die to prevent civil war.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.636
Their deaths saved
the lives of millions,

03:57.638 --> 04:00.706
and I doubt you shed
a tear for the Seers.

04:00.708 --> 04:01.940
You're as much responsible

04:01.942 --> 04:04.309
for what happened
to Milo as they were.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.645
They would have forced him to
help them achieve their goals,

04:06.647 --> 04:08.447
and he didn't want
to be a part of that.

04:08.449 --> 04:12.517
You can try to justify it
all you want,

04:12.519 --> 04:13.752
but I'll never forgive you.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.887
That would be
the easy way out,

04:15.889 --> 04:17.756
to hide behind anger
and bitterness

04:17.758 --> 04:19.992
so that you never have
to face the truth.

04:19.994 --> 04:22.027
But you're stronger than that.

04:22.029 --> 04:25.998
And that's the type of
strength I need by my side.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.799
What're you talking about?

04:27.801 --> 04:30.736
[RYO] My feelings for you
haven't changed, Nyx.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.271
You're insane.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.906
What type of future is there
for you on that ship?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.608
The others will never
fully accept you;

04:36.610 --> 04:39.911
you don't belong with them.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.980
I want you here with me

04:41.982 --> 04:43.582
as my empress.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.398
[TRUFFAULT]
Well, that's quite a story.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.767
A ship filled with people
who can predict the future.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.635
An alternate reality.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.120
[chuckles]

05:05.121 --> 05:06.604
[TRUFFAULT] You certainly
have interesting sources.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.006
It's all true.

05:11.011 --> 05:14.780
Tell me a little bit more
about this Blink Drive.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.948
You can't have it.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.667
Thank you for your time,

05:18.668 --> 05:20.385
and I will take this
information under advisement.

05:20.387 --> 05:21.753
You think this is a joke?

05:21.755 --> 05:23.755
You know we have the drive.
You've seen it work,

05:23.757 --> 05:26.058
and I assume you understand
how powerful it is.

05:26.060 --> 05:27.492
We could be off getting fat

05:27.494 --> 05:29.728
and rich right now
robbing this galaxy blind.

05:29.730 --> 05:30.762
That was my vote.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.632
But instead we came here.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.766
Why do you think that is?

05:34.768 --> 05:36.868
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.071
We have nothing to gain
and everything to lose,

05:39.073 --> 05:41.473
so you might want to start
considering the possibility

05:41.475 --> 05:43.108
that we're telling
you the truth.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.010
The GA is handling
the security.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.511
I'm sure they are
perfectly capable.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.847
No, they're not.
They'll make a mistake,

05:48.849 --> 05:51.483
and everyone on
that station will die.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.021
Look at this
from my point of view.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.390
This is not exactly
the kind of story

05:58.392 --> 06:00.592
I can take to the board.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.762
So? Keep it between us.

06:03.764 --> 06:07.366
And if I bring you in on this
without authorization,

06:07.368 --> 06:08.734
well, I'll be risking my career.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.069
[THREE] You get on
that station without us,

06:11.071 --> 06:13.638
you risk losing a whole hell
of a lot more than that.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.376
[TWO] Tell me everything's
fine--that there's no risk

06:17.378 --> 06:19.044
of a corporate war,
and we'll get back on our ship,

06:19.046 --> 06:20.445
go on our merry way,

06:20.447 --> 06:22.681
and you'll never have
to see us again.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.922
All right.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.725
There may be a level of tension
within the Council

06:33.727 --> 06:37.028
that goes beyond
what the public is aware.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.730
And yes,

06:38.732 --> 06:42.601
if this Blink Drive works
the way you say it does

06:42.603 --> 06:44.603
you may well be in
a unique position to help.

06:49.476 --> 06:52.010
[TRUFFAULT]
Eos 7 wasn't chosen by accident.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.680
It is one of the most
secure facilities in the galaxy.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.016
It is surrounded
by a vast network

06:58.018 --> 06:59.684
of satellites at a distance

06:59.686 --> 07:01.820
of approximately
seven light minutes.

07:01.822 --> 07:05.090
Now, working in concert,
these satellites can generate

07:05.092 --> 07:07.959
what's called
an Aslanov Exclusion Field,

07:07.961 --> 07:09.861
which, for those of you
who might not be aware--

07:09.863 --> 07:12.431
Can disrupt an FTL window?

07:12.433 --> 07:13.765
That's right.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.467
[THREE]
Hmm.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.168
So any ship trying to pass
through the field will drop out?

07:17.171 --> 07:18.870
[TRUFFAULT] Still hours away
from the station

07:18.872 --> 07:21.506
at sub-light speeds,
which would give the GA ships

07:21.508 --> 07:23.542
that are cruising
the perimeter of the field

07:23.544 --> 07:26.178
plenty of time to react.

07:26.180 --> 07:29.114
Once the delegates have arrived
the field will be activated,

07:29.116 --> 07:30.816
and no one will be
allowed in or out

07:30.818 --> 07:32.935
for the duration
of the conference.

07:32.936 --> 07:35.053
Except, with the Blink Drive,
we could pass right through it,

07:35.055 --> 07:36.822
and no one would ever notice.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.591
And with all of their
resources at the perimeter,

07:39.593 --> 07:41.860
they'll never know you're there.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.762
If we're gonna find that bomb
we're gonna need access

07:43.764 --> 07:45.964
to all internal systems.
Sensors, camera feeds,

07:45.966 --> 07:47.349
everything they have.

07:47.350 --> 07:48.733
[TRUFFAULT]
That won't be that easy.

07:48.735 --> 07:51.136
Like I said,
it is a GA facility.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.538
Well, if you can get
one of us on the inside,

07:53.540 --> 07:57.476
we can tap in directly,
like we did on Balda 9.

07:57.478 --> 08:00.545
I suppose I could forge Mikkei
credentials for one of you.

08:00.547 --> 08:01.947
I'll go.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.250
Well, it's either me
or the Android,

08:05.252 --> 08:07.152
and personally I'd
rather have her here

08:07.154 --> 08:09.521
in case anything goes wrong.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.273
No offense, sweetheart,

08:11.274 --> 08:13.024
but you're not exactly
the corporate type.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.095
[SIX]
You sure about this?

08:17.097 --> 08:18.930
[FIVE]
I can handle it. I'm not a kid.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.799
[SIX]
I know,

08:20.800 --> 08:22.667
but you can't blame me
for being a little worried.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.002
You're volunteering
to go onboard a station

08:24.004 --> 08:25.737
that has a good chance
of blowing up.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.606
Well, that's the
whole point isn't it?

08:27.608 --> 08:29.975
We've gotta find the bomb
and stop it from going off.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.210
I know, but...

08:32.212 --> 08:33.645
What?

08:33.647 --> 08:35.280
Milo said the Seers
predicted corporate war

08:35.282 --> 08:37.215
within six months, right?

08:37.217 --> 08:39.217
And in the alternate reality,

08:39.219 --> 08:41.653
the war started
with the bombing on Eos 7,

08:41.655 --> 08:43.889
but how do we know
in this reality

08:43.891 --> 08:45.957
it doesn't start some other way?

08:45.959 --> 08:48.260
How do we know
it's not inevitable?

08:48.262 --> 08:49.661
Well, I guess we don't.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.730
Exactly.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.733
Which means you could be
risking your life for nothing.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.768
It's not nothing.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.971
[sighs]
Look, Milo also told me that

08:59.973 --> 09:03.275
there are moments in history
when things become more fluid.

09:03.277 --> 09:06.211
Patterns change,
and in those moments

09:06.213 --> 09:08.847
the actions of even
a single person

09:08.849 --> 09:11.283
can make a huge difference.

09:11.285 --> 09:13.885
If there is even a chance
that we could stop a war

09:13.887 --> 09:16.922
from happening, we have to try.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.557
I guess you're right.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.959
Of course I am. As usual.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.728
[BOTH chuckle]

09:23.730 --> 09:25.564
Anyway, you'll be right
outside the station

09:25.566 --> 09:28.600
waiting to get me out of there
if anything goes wrong.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.135
I'll be fine.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.272
[GA SERGEANT] Okay, people,
I don't need to tell you

09:34.274 --> 09:36.041
how important
this assignment is.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.076
In less than two weeks,
delegates from every

09:38.078 --> 09:40.845
major corporation in the galaxy
will be arriving here,

09:40.847 --> 09:43.615
and it will be our job
to protect them

09:43.617 --> 09:45.484
from outside threats,

09:45.485 --> 09:47.352
and maybe more importantly,
from each other.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.154
Now, I want you to meet the man

09:49.156 --> 09:50.889
who'll be in charge
of this operation.

09:50.891 --> 09:53.692
He's straight from HQ
on special assignment.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.727
Chief Inspector Kierken.

09:57.698 --> 10:00.765
All right, men.
You all know your assignments.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.601
Let's get to work.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.238
[THE ANDROID]
Are you almost ready?

10:07.240 --> 10:09.007
[FIVE]
Getting there.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.342
[THE ANDROID]
Don't forget your comm.

10:10.344 --> 10:11.710
[FIVE]
I've got it,

10:11.711 --> 10:13.077
but I'm not gonna use it
unless I have no choice.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.814
If they detect the signal,
we're screwed.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.382
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

10:17.384 --> 10:18.783
[FIVE] I've been
through this with Six.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.318
I can handle it.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.054
I don't doubt your ability
to perform the task at hand,

10:23.056 --> 10:24.122
however...

10:24.124 --> 10:25.457
[FIVE]
What?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.791
The more I explore
the parameters

10:26.793 --> 10:28.760
of my empathy emulators,

10:28.762 --> 10:31.630
the more I realize there
can be a negative effect,

10:31.632 --> 10:35.200
and not just because I no longer
perform at 100% efficiency.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.170
I'm worried.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.138
[FIVE] If anything goes wrong,
there's a plan to get me out.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.307
Truffault supplied us
with disguises,

10:42.309 --> 10:44.142
plans to the station...

10:44.144 --> 10:46.277
Everything's gonna be fine.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.714
I also feel guilty at allowing
someone to take a risk

10:49.716 --> 10:51.316
that I myself could assume.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.385
[FIVE] Every day
on this ship is a risk.

10:53.387 --> 10:55.587
You'll get another chance

10:55.588 --> 10:57.788
to put yourself on
the line soon enough.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.324
I suppose I just
never realized that

10:59.326 --> 11:01.826
emotions could have
such a downside.

11:01.828 --> 11:05.063
[FIVE] Well, welcome
to the human race.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.165
'Kay. I'm ready.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.300
So what do you think?

11:09.302 --> 11:10.902
Wow.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.180
[GA SERGEANT]
Mikkei delegation has arrived.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.715
That's everybody.

11:23.717 --> 11:24.883
All right.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.918
Signal the fleet.
Activate the field.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.921
From this moment on
no one in or out.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.761
[THE ANDROID]
We're in position.

11:36.763 --> 11:38.430
Any sign they've detected us?

11:38.432 --> 11:39.764
Negative.

11:39.766 --> 11:40.965
All right.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.934
Now we just wait for Five.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.686
In the meantime,

11:44.687 --> 11:46.437
I've been going over some of
the news footage recorded

11:46.440 --> 11:48.473
when we were in
the alternate reality.

11:49.743 --> 11:52.477
I think I may have found
something interesting.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.717
Hello. Hi.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.719
Hello. Good to see you again.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.322
[clears throat]

12:04.324 --> 12:06.191
If you're gonna pretend
to be a member of my team,

12:06.193 --> 12:08.293
act the part. Stand up straight.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.962
Look people in the eye.

12:10.964 --> 12:14.766
Anyway, you are the least
famous member of your crew.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.735
No one's gonna recognize you.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.306
Commander Truffault.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.743
Commander Nieman.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.111
We meet again.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.313
Yes, we do.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.981
This is my assistant, Cassandra.

12:29.983 --> 12:33.084
We need to talk.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.285
Now.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.221
Well, how about a drink then?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.526
Sorry about that.
Normally he's...

12:41.528 --> 12:44.362
[scoffs]
A really nice guy?

12:44.364 --> 12:47.398
No. No, not really. [chuckles]

12:47.400 --> 12:50.535
Um... I'm Arrian.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.270
I'm with the Ferrous delegation.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.205
Yeah, I got that.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.110
Do you wanna grab a drink?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.379
Uh, no thanks.
There's something I have to do.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.981
Excuse me.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.069
[beeping]

13:25.071 --> 13:26.471
[door hisses opens]

13:57.170 --> 13:58.236
You got something?

13:58.238 --> 14:00.539
She's in.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.841
We've got internal sensors
and security cameras.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.309
Are they scanning for Tarium?

14:04.311 --> 14:06.177
Only in the docking bays.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.013
Why Tarium?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.848
[THE ANDROID] We found evidence
in the alternate reality.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.482
A single report that
suggested the bomb

14:11.484 --> 14:13.484
may have been some kind
of Tarium device.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.220
[NYX]
That doesn't make any sense.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.021
I've been around spaceports
long enough to know

14:17.023 --> 14:20.358
that they always scan for it
wherever ships are docking.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.310
Correct.

14:22.311 --> 14:24.261
It's a precaution
against malfunctioning drives.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.331
Well, if it is a Tarium bomb,

14:26.333 --> 14:28.867
how the hell
would they get it in?

14:28.869 --> 14:30.268
Unknown.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.906
[ARRIAN]
Nice to meet you.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.041
Hey.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.109
[ARRIAN]
You're back.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.377
What'd I miss?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.179
Lotta small talk.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.248
Everyone's still waiting
for the new delegation

14:43.250 --> 14:44.883
from the League
of Autonomous Worlds

14:44.885 --> 14:45.984
to make an appearance.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.052
What do you mean
the new delegation?

14:48.054 --> 14:51.122
Apparently there was
a last-minute change.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.557
Where are they from?

14:52.559 --> 14:54.459
Zairon.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.501
Something wrong?

15:03.503 --> 15:06.237
No. No, everything's fine.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.908
They're carrying weapons.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.509
Daggers.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.212
They're supposedly ceremonial,
so they get to keep them.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.613
I mean, what are
they gonna do?

15:15.615 --> 15:18.149
Slit everyone's throats?
[chuckles]

15:18.151 --> 15:19.284
Um...

15:19.286 --> 15:21.953
Are you sure you're okay?

15:21.955 --> 15:24.522
Yeah, of course. U-Um...

15:24.524 --> 15:26.124
I'll see you later.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.361
There she goes again.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.984
The man's a wanted criminal,
and they expect us

15:52.986 --> 15:54.953
to treat him like a dignitary.

15:54.955 --> 15:57.422
He's got diplomatic immunity.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.023
For now.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.465
What the hell happened?
How'd he get on board?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.500
[THE ANDROID] Apparently he's
an official representative

16:09.502 --> 16:11.736
from the League
of Autonomous Worlds.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.972
If he spots Five,
he's gonna rat her out.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.440
We don't know that for sure.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.641
No, we have to
get her outta there.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.642
[TWO]
She's got her comm.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.711
If she thinks she's in trouble

16:19.713 --> 16:21.612
she'll let us know.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.537
The emperor would like
to speak with you.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.440
Uh--Sorry. I'm a
little busy right now.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.480
[ZAIRON ATTENDANT A] I'm afraid
I'm going to have to insist.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.386
What's in your hand?

17:01.388 --> 17:02.787
[FIVE]
Nothing.

17:03.757 --> 17:05.356
Hey!

17:06.559 --> 17:08.292
[ZAIRON ATTENDANT B]
A communication device.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.694
She's a spy.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.096
I'm not a spy.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.497
I-I-I'm a member
of the Mikkei delegation.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.664
Now let me go.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.400
[ARRIAN]
Is there a problem here?

17:17.370 --> 17:20.638
You looked upset,
so I thought I'd check on you.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.640
She's fine.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.742
Now, unless you want
a diplomatic incident

17:24.744 --> 17:26.277
on your hands,

17:26.279 --> 17:28.312
I suggest you go on your way.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.122
[grunting]

17:38.124 --> 17:41.192
[BOTH grunting]

17:49.102 --> 17:50.168
You're hurt.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.486
[ARRIAN]
No, I'm all right.

17:51.487 --> 17:52.803
Don't be stupid. Let me see.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.344
Oh my god.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.146
You're an Android.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.452
I've found something.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.221
It's one of the
secondary docking bays.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.790
Someone has tampered
with the camera feed.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.192
It's on a loop.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.910
[THREE]
How can you tell?

18:15.911 --> 18:17.627
[THE ANDROID] It's imperceptible
to the human eye,

18:17.630 --> 18:19.530
but the shadows cast
by the starlight

18:19.532 --> 18:21.365
reset every ten minutes.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.867
Whose shuttle is that?

18:22.869 --> 18:24.552
Ferrous Corp.

18:24.553 --> 18:26.236
That's their way off the
station without being detected.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.840
We were right.

18:28.842 --> 18:31.175
It's also our way in.

18:31.177 --> 18:32.577
Suit up.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.493
[FIVE sighs]
That'll hold 'em for a while.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.232
Let's take a look.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.639
Your nanites will have it
closed up pretty soon,

19:01.641 --> 19:04.509
but... in the meantime,
you'd better stay out of sight.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.277
Are you gonna turn me in?

19:06.279 --> 19:08.379
No.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.780
Why not?

19:11.584 --> 19:13.584
You're running
an illegal software upgrade.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.653
It's the only way

19:15.654 --> 19:17.721
you could've gotten on board
without anybody noticing.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.291
Nieman gave it to me.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.425
Why?

19:21.427 --> 19:23.661
He said he wanted protection.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.229
A bodyguard.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.864
W-Well, if they find out,
they won't just

19:26.866 --> 19:27.932
kick you out of the conference.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.234
They'll have you destroyed.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.305
Besides...

19:34.307 --> 19:36.240
...I owe you one.

19:36.242 --> 19:38.209
[ARRIAN] I don't understand.
You're with Mikkei.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.845
You could use this
information to your advantage.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.282
Yeah, I'm not surprised
you would think that.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.652
All I can tell you is
we're not all like Nieman.

19:50.256 --> 19:51.656
Good luck.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.234
Well, don't you three
look very corporate?

20:03.236 --> 20:04.869
This is ridiculous.
I look ridiculous.

20:04.871 --> 20:05.970
You look fine.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.188
I didn't even wanna do

20:07.189 --> 20:08.405
this stupid job
in the first place.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.974
Look, when we're done,
I promise you

20:09.976 --> 20:11.475
we'll pull a heist, okay?

20:11.477 --> 20:13.661
--Seriously?
--Yeah.

20:13.662 --> 20:15.846
You can even choose the target.
Bank job, jewels, whatever.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.448
But first we save the galaxy.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.617
--Got it?
--Fine.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.486
You've got the bridge.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.354
Hopefully we're in and out
without anyone noticing,

20:23.355 --> 20:25.222
but if things go sideways,
we might need a show of force.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.624
We'll be ready.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.814
All right. Take these.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.983
The Android calibrated them
to detect any trace

20:51.985 --> 20:53.802
of Tarium radiation.

20:53.803 --> 20:55.620
There's no way we can search
this whole station.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.688
Yeah. Stick to the upper levels.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.023
If someone managed
to get a bomb onboard

20:59.025 --> 21:00.658
there's no way
they'd risk getting caught

21:00.659 --> 21:02.292
by trying to sneak it
into a restricted area.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.762
My guess is it's probably
in somebody's quarters.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.632
If you get within ten meters
of a source, you'll know it.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.838
[CHAIRMAN] The chair
recognizes Commander Nieman.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.940
Representing
Ferrous Corporation.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.659
Commander.

21:17.660 --> 21:19.377
Mr. Chairman, distinguished
members of the Council,

21:19.379 --> 21:21.412
let me get straight
to the point.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.914
These are difficult times.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.752
I think on that,
we can all agree,

21:27.754 --> 21:30.388
and while change may
sometimes be necessary,

21:30.390 --> 21:32.790
and is indeed inevitable,

21:32.792 --> 21:35.559
difficult times
require stability.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.762
Now is not the time
to make alterations

21:37.764 --> 21:40.464
to the Council by
introducing new members.

21:40.466 --> 21:44.368
This is time for very careful
consideration of our actions

21:44.370 --> 21:47.405
and the consequences
of those actions.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.507
That is why I must vote
against the proposed changes

21:49.509 --> 21:52.043
brought forward by my...
distinguished colleague

21:52.045 --> 21:54.679
from Traugott Corporation,

21:54.681 --> 21:57.882
and why I urge all of you

21:57.884 --> 21:59.617
to do the same.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.752
Thank you, Commander.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.387
As there are
no other submissions,

22:03.389 --> 22:06.457
we will now put
the proposal to a vote.

22:19.872 --> 22:23.674
We have the results,
and they are as follows.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.110
Seven votes for,
five against,

22:26.112 --> 22:28.112
and one abstention.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.714
The resolution passes.

22:33.553 --> 22:37.555
Commander, do you have
something more to say?

22:37.557 --> 22:40.958
No, Mr. Chairman, I'd simply
like to request a recess.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.593
I find these...

22:42.595 --> 22:45.896
...proceedings to be
quite exhausting.

22:45.898 --> 22:46.997
[CHAIRMAN]
Granted.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.767
Council is adjourned
for one hour.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.792
Hi.

23:16.963 --> 23:20.998
[beeping]

23:21.000 --> 23:22.600
How's it going?

23:31.010 --> 23:33.711
I was wondering when
I would see you again.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.722
We need to talk.

23:50.163 --> 23:51.762
'Scuse me.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.735
[sighs]

24:00.573 --> 24:01.972
[KIERKEN]
Going somewhere?

24:04.610 --> 24:08.746
I've been waiting for
this moment a long time,

24:08.748 --> 24:10.781
Lieutenant Kal Varrick.

24:18.691 --> 24:21.192
[RYO]
These diplomats--

24:21.194 --> 24:23.928
all they do is talk.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.767
And I thought Boone
could be tiresome.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.168
I'm good.

24:33.206 --> 24:35.906
Why are you here, Portia?

24:35.908 --> 24:38.509
I'm sorry--Two.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.011
You're in danger.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.480
[RYO]
Aren't we all?

24:42.482 --> 24:43.881
You know in
the alternate reality

24:43.883 --> 24:46.584
it was the destruction
of Eos 7 that started the war.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.819
And you think the same thing
will happen here.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.721
We think Ferrous
smuggled a bomb on board.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.223
Three and Six are
searching for it now.

24:52.225 --> 24:54.825
I also studied the events
as they unfolded

24:54.827 --> 24:56.560
in the alternate reality.

24:56.562 --> 24:58.095
When the war broke out,

24:58.097 --> 25:00.498
the corporations' backing
Zairon's enemies

25:00.500 --> 25:01.999
had to pull their resources.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.768
It was the turning point
that saved the house of Ishida.

25:04.770 --> 25:07.638
Are you telling me
you want the war to happen?

25:07.640 --> 25:10.975
My people are already at war.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.244
Thousands have died.

25:13.246 --> 25:15.713
Millions more will follow.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.081
You can help me.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.216
What're you talking about?

25:19.218 --> 25:20.951
The Blink Drive.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.853
Let my scientists study it.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.889
I'll give you safe
harbor on Zairon

25:24.891 --> 25:26.757
until we can replicate it.

25:26.759 --> 25:29.860
It's far too powerful
to give to any military force.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.095
Every major corporation

25:31.097 --> 25:33.130
is pursuing their
own version of it.

25:33.132 --> 25:36.300
Whoever gets there first
will have an advantage.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.536
You can choose who that is.

25:38.538 --> 25:41.305
That's a little bit
too much responsibility.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.207
In the right hands,

25:43.209 --> 25:45.576
it could save millions.

25:45.578 --> 25:49.280
In the wrong hands,
it could enslave millions.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.318
I'm sorry, Ryo.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.220
I can't help you.

25:58.257 --> 26:00.658
I can have you arrested.

26:02.295 --> 26:03.894
I know.

26:26.319 --> 26:28.686
[BOTH grunting]

26:28.688 --> 26:30.287
Ah! Ah...

26:30.289 --> 26:32.089
Three? What the hell?!

26:32.091 --> 26:33.624
I didn't want you to scream.

26:33.626 --> 26:34.658
Sort of like you just did?

26:34.660 --> 26:35.659
That wasn't a scream.

26:35.661 --> 26:37.861
It was a manly cry of pain.

26:37.863 --> 26:39.096
I was just about to contact you.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.731
Four is here.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.132
Yeah, we know.
Has he spotted you?

26:42.134 --> 26:43.667
Yeah, he definitely
knows we're here.

26:43.669 --> 26:47.371
Ah, man, this is gonna
complicate things.

26:47.373 --> 26:49.206
Okay, listen.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.008
The Android thinks
the bomb is Tarium-based.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.043
She sent us in
with these detectors.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.112
Let me see.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.180
We've been sweeping
the upper levels, but nothing.

26:57.183 --> 26:59.183
Wait a minute.
How did you get on board?

26:59.185 --> 27:00.317
[THREE]
The Marauder.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.919
Ferrous rigged one
of the docking bays

27:01.921 --> 27:03.754
so they could leave
without anyone noticing.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.222
It's definitely them.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.124
Ferrous just lost a big vote,

27:07.126 --> 27:09.259
and then they called
for a recess.

27:09.261 --> 27:10.861
Oh shit.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.831
We're outta time.

27:13.833 --> 27:14.798
I'm calling the others.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.333
Wait, not yet.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.268
Go to the Marauder,
prep for launch.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.037
Give me ten minutes.

27:20.039 --> 27:21.622
Five.

27:21.623 --> 27:23.206
I think I might know
where the bomb is.

27:35.721 --> 27:37.154
[RYO]
This is a great honor.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.720
[KIERKEN]
Inside.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.430
This space station
is in danger.

28:19.432 --> 28:21.331
I have no doubt.

28:22.735 --> 28:24.334
Who else is here with you?

28:24.336 --> 28:25.836
Boone, Lin?

28:25.838 --> 28:28.305
We're not the problem.
It's Ferrous Corp.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.107
They brought a bomb on board.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.443
Now, I-I don't know how they
got it past your scans,

28:32.445 --> 28:34.712
but you have to believe me.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.414
No.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.016
I don't.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.424
[THREE]
Hey, buddy.

28:47.426 --> 28:50.260
You look a little
overdressed for a mechanic.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.999
Just heading back to my shuttle.

28:58.738 --> 29:00.504
You know what?

29:00.506 --> 29:03.107
I'll take the long way around.

29:03.109 --> 29:04.942

[ALL grunting]

[THREE groaning]

29:17.523 --> 29:19.890
Mr. Boone.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.826
[THREE]
Great.

29:22.828 --> 29:26.063
It's been a while
since you double-crossed us

29:26.065 --> 29:27.965
in that mining colony.

29:29.502 --> 29:33.237
Now, what brings you
all the way out here?

29:34.306 --> 29:36.874
We know about your plot
to bomb the station...

29:36.876 --> 29:39.843
...and we're gonna stop you.

29:39.845 --> 29:42.212
That's unlikely.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.314
I'm telling you,
it's Ferrous Corp.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.049
They want to start a war.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.551
By blowing up
their own delegation?

29:47.553 --> 29:50.354
By the time goes off
they'll be long gone.

29:50.356 --> 29:53.524
They've got a way off the
station without being detected.

29:53.526 --> 29:55.292
And so what do you
expect me to do?

29:55.294 --> 29:56.927
Arrest them based on your word?

29:56.929 --> 29:59.163
At least bring them
in for questioning.

29:59.165 --> 30:02.299
[ALL grunting]

30:02.301 --> 30:05.035
[KIERKEN] Ferrous Corp.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.170
of this council.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.572
Law-abiding citizens.
Leaders.

30:08.574 --> 30:09.907
[SIX]
Pillars of the community.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.542
[KIERKEN]
Exactly.

30:11.544 --> 30:13.294
You, on the other hand,

30:13.295 --> 30:15.045
are a traitor who turned
his back on his own

30:15.047 --> 30:17.381
to help a bunch of criminals
escape justice.

30:17.383 --> 30:20.284
They were gonna be murdered
before they ever got to trial.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.486
That's not justice.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.255
What does Ishida have planned?

30:25.257 --> 30:26.290
Ishida?

30:26.292 --> 30:27.858
He's got nothing
to do with this.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.359
So it's just a coincidence
that the two of you

30:29.361 --> 30:30.844
are here together
at the same time?

30:30.845 --> 30:32.328
I didn't even know
he was going to be here.

30:32.331 --> 30:33.363
You work together.

30:33.365 --> 30:35.299
[SIX]
Not anymore.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.234
It can't be him,
because unlike Ferrous Corp.,

30:37.236 --> 30:38.969
he doesn't have a way
of getting off the station

30:38.971 --> 30:40.838
without setting off an alarm.

30:42.374 --> 30:43.941
[door hisses opens]

Hey. That's a restricted area.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.880
Oh, uh...

I was looking for a C concourse.

31:25.017 --> 31:27.117
Back the way you came.
Two levels up.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.920
Where does this lead?

31:29.922 --> 31:32.155
[GA OFFICER A]
That's classified.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.129
[CHAIRMAN] Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

31:40.332 --> 31:43.000
[CHAIRMAN] Council is
brought back to order.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.541
[THE CHAIRMAN]
The next matter on the agenda

31:51.543 --> 31:54.511
is the continuing unrest
in the outer colonies.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.598
Four. I was expecting
the Marauder.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.935
Its verification code has been
used to access the ship.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.987
Yes, Android. I'm sorry,

32:19.988 --> 32:22.038
but I'm in a bit of a hurry
and don't have time to explain.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.291
Explain what?

Go to the bridge.

32:34.052 --> 32:35.719
Monitor for any signs
of the Marauder's return.

32:35.721 --> 32:39.423
If you encounter anyone
use non-lethal force only.

32:39.425 --> 32:40.657
Understood.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.326
I'll get the Blink Drive.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.677
Arrian!

33:08.053 --> 33:11.188
The Ferrous Corp. delegation
left, didn't they?

33:11.190 --> 33:12.589
Yes.

33:14.026 --> 33:16.293
Without you.

33:16.295 --> 33:18.228
Why would they do that?

[sensor beeping]

33:21.133 --> 33:22.532
[FIVE gasps]

33:24.069 --> 33:25.469
I knew it...

33:29.341 --> 33:31.308
You're the bomb.

33:36.081 --> 33:39.349
[NYX] Android, have we
heard anything yet?

33:39.351 --> 33:41.418
Android, come in.

33:43.088 --> 33:46.089
This device is detecting
the Tarium in your system.

33:46.091 --> 33:49.226
Then my shielding
has begun to degrade.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.194
You have to get
off this station.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.462
No.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.164
You were kind to me,

33:54.166 --> 33:57.334
even after you found out
I was not human.

33:57.336 --> 33:59.236
I don't want you to die.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.570
Then deactivate the bomb.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.522
[ARRIAN]
I can't.

34:02.523 --> 34:04.473
It's inside me, but
I have no control over it.

34:04.476 --> 34:07.210
Only Commander Nieman
has the deactivation code.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.512
Then shut down.

34:08.513 --> 34:09.813
I'll get you back to our ship.
Find a way to--

34:09.815 --> 34:12.582
Shutting down
won't make a difference.

34:12.584 --> 34:15.185
You have to leave now.

34:15.187 --> 34:18.221
What about all the other
people on this station?

34:19.091 --> 34:21.191
There's nothing
I can do for them.

34:21.193 --> 34:24.227
That upgrade didn't just
change the way you talk.

34:24.229 --> 34:27.531
It changed the way
you think and feel.

34:27.533 --> 34:28.598
You tried to help me

34:28.600 --> 34:31.368
before you knew
I could be trusted.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.103
Why?

34:35.240 --> 34:37.507
I don't know.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.776
I do.

34:39.778 --> 34:43.113
Because I know someone
just like you.

34:43.115 --> 34:45.115
An android?

34:45.117 --> 34:46.783
[FIVE]
A friend.

34:46.785 --> 34:50.620
She saved my life
I don't know how many times,

34:50.622 --> 34:52.355
and not because
she's programmed to,

34:52.357 --> 34:56.393
but because she cares.

34:56.395 --> 34:57.527
And once you start to care,

34:57.529 --> 34:59.196
it's not so easy
to turn your back

34:59.198 --> 35:03.133
when something terrible
is about to happen.

35:03.135 --> 35:04.768
Arrian, this could start a war.

35:04.770 --> 35:08.138
There has to be
something we can do.

35:10.142 --> 35:12.142
Yes.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.677
You are right.

35:15.481 --> 35:17.380
There is a way.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.218
Where are you going?

35:59.391 --> 36:02.259
[CHAIRMAN]
Order. Order, please.

36:02.261 --> 36:04.528
Seal the hangars!
This station is under lockdown.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.796
[GA OFFICER B] Yes, sir.
Move it! Let's go!

36:06.798 --> 36:09.399
[NYX] Android,
why aren't you answering?

36:12.804 --> 36:14.871
What're you doing here?

36:14.872 --> 36:16.939
I was hoping we'd
cross paths one last time.

36:23.282 --> 36:25.448
What have you done
with the android?

36:25.450 --> 36:28.485
The android should be
the least of your concerns.

36:38.263 --> 36:41.331
[BOTH grunting]

36:50.642 --> 36:52.409
[NYX]
Ah! [grunts]

36:53.378 --> 36:56.446
[BOTH panting]

37:07.359 --> 37:09.893
I can guess almost
every move you make.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.698
You can't beat me.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.967
Oh, I don't need to beat you.

37:16.969 --> 37:19.436
I just needed to cut you...

37:19.438 --> 37:21.655
...once.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.873
The poison that coats
my blade will do the rest.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.579
[grunts]

37:29.581 --> 37:32.282
[panting]

37:32.284 --> 37:34.884
[whimpers]

37:34.886 --> 37:36.486
[sighs]

37:36.488 --> 37:38.588
[RYO]
Misaki, I have the drive.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.723
Fall back to the shuttle.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.324
Yes, Heika.

37:53.705 --> 37:57.007
[RYO] Did you encounter
any resistance?

37:57.009 --> 37:58.275
None.

37:58.277 --> 37:59.676
Good.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.347
[KIERKEN] This is
Chief Inspector Kierken

38:04.349 --> 38:05.749
of the Galactic Authority.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.484
Please remain calm.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.619
We're in the process
of investigating an explosion

38:09.621 --> 38:11.421
that occurred off-station.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.790
Preliminary assessments
reveal no structural damage

38:13.792 --> 38:15.025
to the station itself.

38:15.027 --> 38:16.660
However, be advised:

38:16.662 --> 38:18.728
security protocols
have been enacted,

38:18.730 --> 38:20.964
and this station is
now under lockdown.

38:22.567 --> 38:26.002
[RYO] Activation code
Delta-Gulf-Echo-0-0-9.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.743
Four?

38:32.744 --> 38:34.711
[RYO] Android, listen to me.
I've taken the Blink Drive.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.946
I had no other choice,
but that's not important.

38:36.948 --> 38:38.748
Right now I need you
to contact the crew

38:38.750 --> 38:41.318
and have them fall back
to the ship immediately.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.853
In approximately 20 minutes
the station will be destroyed.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.089
There's no time to stop
what's about to happen,

38:46.091 --> 38:48.058
but there is time for them
to save themselves.

38:48.060 --> 38:50.860
Contact them. Now.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.930
Two, Three, Five, Six,

38:53.932 --> 38:56.966
if you can hear me,
you must return to the ship.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.435
[TWO]
Android, this is Two.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.070
There was an explosion
outside the station.

39:00.072 --> 39:01.371
I think one of the others

39:01.372 --> 39:02.671
might've found the bomb
and spaced it.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.074
That may be true,
but I believe

39:04.076 --> 39:06.042
there may now be another threat.

39:06.044 --> 39:08.078
[TWO]
What do you mean?

39:08.079 --> 39:10.113
Four has a plot in place
to destroy the station.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.716
You have less than
20 minutes to get here.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.651
How do you know this?

39:14.652 --> 39:16.585
[THE ANDROID]
He was on board. I'm sorry.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.588
He used some kind
of deactivation code

39:18.590 --> 39:20.357
I wasn't aware of.

39:20.359 --> 39:21.991
He took the Blink Drive.

39:21.993 --> 39:23.693
Shit...

39:23.695 --> 39:25.562
Is anyone else reading this?
Please respond.

39:25.564 --> 39:26.863
[KIERKEN]
I am.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.032
This is Chief Inspector Kierken.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.967
I already have
one of your people.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.803
I took the liberty of borrowing
his communication device.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.939
You are not getting
off this station.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.574
It could save us all
a lot of time and trouble

39:37.576 --> 39:39.809
if you'd just
turn yourself in. Now.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.144
If you've been
monitoring this channel

39:41.146 --> 39:42.612
then you heard
the message I just got

39:42.614 --> 39:43.847
from my ship's android.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.683
[KIERKEN] Yes.
It sounded almost convincing.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.651
I saw a member
of the Zairon delegation

39:48.653 --> 39:49.786
enter a restricted area.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.755
They've already
breached your security.

39:51.757 --> 39:52.889
You're lying.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.491
[TWO]
He could be anywhere by now.

39:54.493 --> 39:56.426
Life support. The reactor core.

39:56.428 --> 39:58.928
Where would you go if you were
trying to destroy the station?

39:58.930 --> 40:00.964
And while we're off
on this wild goose chase,

40:00.966 --> 40:02.632
what will you be doing?

40:02.634 --> 40:04.701
[TWO]
Listen to me.

40:04.702 --> 40:06.769
The lives of everyone on
this station are in your hands.

40:06.772 --> 40:09.139
They should be your priority.

40:09.141 --> 40:10.807
Are the delegates
still in lockdown?

40:10.809 --> 40:12.409
Yes, sir, we're holding them
in the conference room.

40:12.411 --> 40:13.910
They're starting
to get a little impatient.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.178
I don't care.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.746
Portia Lin is on this station.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.415
Probably Boone as well.

40:18.417 --> 40:19.182
I want them found.

40:19.184 --> 40:20.784
[GA OFFICER C]
Yes, sir.

40:45.877 --> 40:47.710
Step away from the console.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.080
Please.

40:51.082 --> 40:51.981
It's too soon.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.216
[KIERKEN]
Step away.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.818
Now!

41:15.874 --> 41:19.476
[screaming, chattering]

41:29.955 --> 41:31.721
[TWO grunts]

41:33.091 --> 41:35.625
[TWO] Three, Five, Six,
if you can hear me,

41:35.627 --> 41:37.227
get down to the Marauder.

41:37.229 --> 41:38.795
[THREE grunts]

41:38.797 --> 41:40.196
[coughs]

41:42.000 --> 41:46.102
[footsteps]

42:02.687 --> 42:05.755
[screaming, yelling]

42:16.902 --> 42:18.735
[TRUFFAULT]
Hey, come with me.
