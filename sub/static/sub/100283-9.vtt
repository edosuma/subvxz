Hey.

38:17.920 --> 38:20.047
How you doing?

38:20.131 --> 38:21.299
I missed you.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.759
Hmm?

38:23.843 --> 38:27.221
You and mommy been hanging out?

38:27.305 --> 38:29.932
- Mommy.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.934
- [smooches, laughs]

38:35.938 --> 38:37.857
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:37.940 --> 38:39.442
Did you get yourself something
to eat?

38:39.525 --> 38:41.861
- Yeah.

38:41.944 --> 38:43.446
- Better today, at school?

38:43.529 --> 38:45.448
- [sighs]
Yeah.

38:49.910 --> 38:52.747
Find anything new
about Sarge Will?

38:52.830 --> 38:55.666
- This isn't
"CSI: Sutton Grove."

38:55.750 --> 38:57.418
- [laughs]

38:57.501 --> 38:59.879
Yeah.

38:59.962 --> 39:03.257
Sunday just seems so long ago.

39:03.341 --> 39:06.886
- Did you just say "Sunday"?

39:06.969 --> 39:08.679
- I mean, Monday?

39:08.763 --> 39:10.097
Was it Monday?

39:10.181 --> 39:15.478
The papers say that they found
him Tuesday morning, so--

39:15.561 --> 39:18.481
- Well, it turns out
you're right.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.691
The autopsy just came out.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.276
He, uh...

39:22.360 --> 39:24.362
died Sunday night sometime.

39:27.573 --> 39:29.700
- Oh, you can find out a lot
from those things.

39:29.784 --> 39:32.286
- If you're looking
for the right things.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.122
- Are they?

39:35.206 --> 39:36.624
Mom?

39:38.584 --> 39:39.710
- The more they look,

39:39.794 --> 39:42.505
the more things
seem suspicious.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.298
- What?

39:44.382 --> 39:46.467
- There's just a lot of facts
that don't add up.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.135
- Like what?

39:48.219 --> 39:50.679
- It's just--
it's gruesome stuff, Addy.

39:50.763 --> 39:51.722
You don't want to know.
- I do want to know.

39:51.806 --> 39:52.807
We all knew him.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.350
- You don't want to know, Addy.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.727
- Mom, tell me.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.938
Be real with me.

39:59.021 --> 40:01.941
You say you want to me to talk
to you,

40:02.024 --> 40:03.526
then treat me like an adult.

40:03.609 --> 40:05.528
- Stuff, Addy.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.530
Bullet trajectory.

40:07.613 --> 40:08.531
Gunshot residue.

40:08.614 --> 40:12.326
There's damage to his mouth.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.620
- What kind of damage?
- His teeth.

40:14.703 --> 40:17.164
He had caps,
and they were knocked out.

40:18.624 --> 40:19.959
- From the gunshot?

40:20.042 --> 40:21.877
- Or because someone
shoved a gun in there.
