WEBVTT

00:04.553 --> 00:07.431
- What's the deal on this hit man?
- Independent contractor.

00:07.513 --> 00:09.629
Rumour is, he got into town last night.

00:09.713 --> 00:12.625
- The guy who did the Rivera hit last year?
- Yeah.

00:12.713 --> 00:13.987
Sorry.

00:14.073 --> 00:16.792
- Hey, Max. I didn't hear you come in.
- How's it going?

00:16.873 --> 00:17.908
Hey.

00:17.993 --> 00:22.111
- Just came by to cadge some coffee.
- Sorry. The market's been out for a week.

00:22.193 --> 00:26.744
Ironic, considering Seattle was the coffee
capital of North America back in the day.

00:26.833 --> 00:30.712
Sounds like you got a situation.
Who are the bad guys looking to whack?

00:30.793 --> 00:33.626
Not sure yet, but you can bet
it's one of the good guys.

00:33.713 --> 00:38.070
- What do you need me to do?
- Don't worry. We got it covered.

00:39.873 --> 00:44.151
Me and S1W are gonna do some recon,
narrow the list of potential targets.

00:44.753 --> 00:49.508
I didn't want you to worry about it.
I know you got your plate full these days.

00:49.593 --> 00:53.029
Yeah. Well, good luck. I gotta jet.

00:54.033 --> 00:58.265
What are you doin' later on?
There's a party at Crash. It's Halloween.

00:59.633 --> 01:02.864
We'll probably be working on this all night.

01:02.953 --> 01:04.432
OK. Later.

01:08.353 --> 01:12.551
- So blondie was there at 8am?
- Gotta get up early to save the world.

01:13.313 --> 01:17.625
Don't go there. You should see them
together. They're so into their hero stuff.

01:17.713 --> 01:19.704
Hot run.

01:21.833 --> 01:24.267
Hello? People?

01:25.593 --> 01:27.106
Hello!

01:28.793 --> 01:30.863
Great. I'm talking to myself.

01:30.953 --> 01:34.741
687 Magnolia. Take off that get-up.
You look like a weirdo.

01:35.513 --> 01:38.425
For your information,
I am the shape of things to come.

01:38.513 --> 01:42.188
Demons, mutants, monsters, creatures
not of this world, walking among us.

01:42.273 --> 01:44.741
It says so right here.

01:47.833 --> 01:51.269
- What is this falderal?
- The press follow-up on the Eyes Only story

01:51.353 --> 01:55.471
about the Manticore escapees. Everything
the government doesn't want you to know.

01:55.553 --> 01:58.192
You have an ass for a head.
Now, bip-bip-bip.

01:58.273 --> 01:59.865
It's three o'clock.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.786
That's the time.
D'you wanna give me the weather?

02:02.873 --> 02:06.070
It's Halloween.
The whole town's shuttin' down early.

02:06.153 --> 02:09.747
- It's just another business day to me.
- I'm not hearing it.

02:09.833 --> 02:13.587
- Why you gotta be so salty?
- Whine all you like in that illiterate dialect,

02:13.673 --> 02:16.426
but we're not closing early. Capeesh?

02:16.513 --> 02:22.509
Normal, when it comes to a test of wills,
you're gonna win hands down.

02:22.593 --> 02:25.505
- Cos you the man.
- But at what price?

02:25.913 --> 02:31.385
You're gonna lose half a day tomorrow easy,
just gettin' the toilet paper off the building.

02:38.113 --> 02:41.423
All right. Last run today
will be at four o'clock.

02:41.513 --> 02:44.550
But I want all of you
in here extra early tomorrow.

02:45.353 --> 02:46.866
Losers.

02:50.353 --> 02:51.991
Max.

02:52.073 --> 02:53.586
- Hey.
- How's it goin'?

02:53.673 --> 02:55.868
Just another day in a broken world.

02:55.953 --> 03:00.151
Yeah. There's a party tonight at Crash.
I was wondering if you were gonna go.

03:00.233 --> 03:03.031
- Thinkin' on it.
- So maybe I'll catch you there.

03:03.553 --> 03:05.145
Maybe.

03:10.313 --> 03:12.827
- What did your boy want?
- To hang out.

03:12.913 --> 03:15.268
- And you said?
- Maybe.

03:15.353 --> 03:18.743
Maybe. That is a sign of mental health.

03:19.433 --> 03:23.551
I ever tell you ladies the one about
the priest, the minister and the rabbi?

03:23.633 --> 03:27.023
- Every day, Murray, every day.
- Good one.

03:28.113 --> 03:32.106
- What are you gonna go as tonight?
- Either Snow Ho and the Seven Little Pimps

03:32.193 --> 03:35.947
or Rick James. I'm thinkin' Super Freak,
but depends on the curl activator.

03:36.033 --> 03:38.866
Can we go by Joshua's?
I've got groceries to drop off.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.591
Let's say hey to doggy-dog.

04:22.753 --> 04:27.429
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

04:27.513 --> 04:29.504
Then she escaped.

04:29.593 --> 04:34.030
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

04:34.113 --> 04:36.468
she is haunted by her past.

04:36.553 --> 04:41.547
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

05:30.113 --> 05:32.547
Trick or treat? Did I scare you?

05:33.673 --> 05:35.948
Why they call it Halloween, boo.

05:36.033 --> 05:40.390
So, you got candy?
Me and my crew have got a carton of eggs.

05:41.153 --> 05:42.905
Here's five bucks. Beat it.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.464
Cool costume, mister.

05:47.633 --> 05:50.022
Are you all right?

05:59.633 --> 06:04.423
I used to live in a crib kinda like this
with a Dominican sister named Veronica.

06:04.513 --> 06:06.743
Aye, mommy.

06:06.833 --> 06:10.542
Joshua, we can't stay too long.
We're going out tonight.

06:16.513 --> 06:18.151
Halloween.

06:19.033 --> 06:21.183
"Cool costume, mister."

06:23.753 --> 06:27.541
Max and Joshua,
outside with up-there people.

06:27.633 --> 06:29.589
- No.
- Yes.

06:29.673 --> 06:31.584
Do you wanna end up in a cage?

06:31.673 --> 06:35.063
Lived in cage. Down there, cage. Basement.

06:35.153 --> 06:39.351
No, a real cage, like an animal in a zoo.
That's if they don't just kill you.

06:43.473 --> 06:46.510
Tonight, up-here people look like Joshua.

06:46.593 --> 06:48.709
Tonight, safe.

06:49.153 --> 06:52.987
He's got a point. Halloween's
the one night when he can get his swerve on.

06:53.073 --> 06:55.826
Get my swerve on. Tricks and treats.

06:57.953 --> 07:00.945
What's the worst thing that could happen?

07:02.953 --> 07:06.468
I know you think you're trying to help. Don't.

07:07.353 --> 07:11.062
You gotta promise me you won't go out.
You have to lay low.

07:12.113 --> 07:14.263
Trust me. I'm lookin' out for you.

07:18.353 --> 07:19.752
OK.

07:21.953 --> 07:24.342
Lay low.

07:25.673 --> 07:29.268
Read Father's books. <i>Little Women.</i>

07:35.513 --> 07:37.026
Good.

07:38.153 --> 07:40.542
I got you some of those snack cakes you like.

07:53.593 --> 07:56.710
I've been thinkin' about
a nice hot bath all day.

07:56.793 --> 08:01.389
I've been thinkin' about Joshua all alone
while the rest of the world is having a party.

08:01.473 --> 08:04.431
What am I supposed to do?
Let him tag along with me?

08:04.513 --> 08:07.710
"Hey, gang. Say hi to Joshua,
my transgenic mutant friend."

08:07.793 --> 08:10.068
Everyone's gonna think it's a costume.

08:10.153 --> 08:14.704
He's better off where he is. No one can ask
him any questions or make any judgments.

08:14.793 --> 08:17.353
Judgements about who? Him or you?

08:21.233 --> 08:27.229
Look, all I wanna be is a nice normal girl,
and have a nice normal Halloween.

08:27.593 --> 08:30.153
Whatever normal means.

08:55.193 --> 08:57.184
Wake up, boo.

08:57.273 --> 08:59.468
I'm awake.

08:59.553 --> 09:02.192
- Your boy's here.
- My boy?

09:02.273 --> 09:04.662
Your date. Rafer.

09:13.593 --> 09:15.788
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:16.833 --> 09:19.666
- No costume?
- I don't really do Halloween. You?

09:19.753 --> 09:24.588
I'm a genetically engineered killing machine
escaped from a government lab.

09:30.553 --> 09:33.067
You don't read the tabloids?

09:34.513 --> 09:36.822
Weren't we supposed to meet at Crash?

09:36.913 --> 09:39.985
Yeah. This is kind of embarrassing,

09:40.073 --> 09:43.393
but would you mind
coming by my mom's place with me?

09:43.393 --> 09:43.711
But would you mind
coming by my mom's place with me?

09:43.793 --> 09:46.785
- Your mom?
- She really wants to meet you.

09:46.873 --> 09:49.262
Is that a problem?

09:49.353 --> 09:51.071
No. Not at all.

09:51.153 --> 09:52.791
Rafer.

09:52.873 --> 09:55.103
And this must be Max.

09:55.193 --> 09:58.390
- Nice to meet you.
- He's told me so much about you.

09:58.473 --> 10:01.590
I said I must meet this special girl.

10:01.673 --> 10:06.383
- I'm not so special.
- Come. Let me tell your fortune.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.464
I don't know...

10:12.873 --> 10:15.706
I can really see the family resemblance.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.985
Max is not your name.

10:21.953 --> 10:24.592
You two have the same nose.

10:24.673 --> 10:27.506
- Your name is...
- Guevara. Max Guevara.

10:28.913 --> 10:30.028
No.

10:30.113 --> 10:33.423
It says so right here on my sector pass.

10:33.513 --> 10:36.550
You have no name, only a number.

10:39.673 --> 10:43.029
I see secrets, dark secrets,

10:43.113 --> 10:46.264
wrapped in mystery, shrouded in illusion.

10:46.353 --> 10:48.821
You are not what you seem!

10:49.993 --> 10:52.348
Guess you busted me on my push-up bra.

10:52.433 --> 10:54.867
You are running from something.

10:54.953 --> 10:57.342
Running from your past.

10:58.193 --> 11:02.630
- I was gawky in high school.
- No matter where you run there is danger.

11:03.353 --> 11:05.344
I see danger all around.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.308
And then I see...

11:10.913 --> 11:13.222
I see nothing.

11:16.793 --> 11:19.068
Except a face!

11:19.153 --> 11:22.384
Whose face? Is it a guy?

11:22.473 --> 11:25.590
A girl, then. With blonde hair, right?

11:25.673 --> 11:28.028
It is neither man nor woman.

11:29.633 --> 11:32.022
It is the face of...

11:32.913 --> 11:34.904
death!

11:39.473 --> 11:43.546
Mom, are you OK?
Let's get you some water.

11:47.233 --> 11:49.622
Great first impression.

11:59.473 --> 12:01.703
I thought I told you to stay home.

12:01.793 --> 12:04.182
Max and Joshua outside.

12:08.353 --> 12:11.345
You just don't see fabric like this any more.

12:12.193 --> 12:15.902
My mom's OK. Sometimes she gets
a little carried away, but she likes you.

12:15.993 --> 12:19.952
- That's great.
- Rafer, my son!

12:20.033 --> 12:21.864
Be right back.

12:22.633 --> 12:24.942
- Max and Joshua gotta blaze.
- Go home.

12:26.353 --> 12:28.344
Pretty wack.

12:28.993 --> 12:31.666
If I go out there for one minute,
will you go away?

12:31.753 --> 12:34.142
- Lay low till you say so.
- OK.

12:35.553 --> 12:40.149
- How'd you find me?
- Original Cindy said "She's with hot boy."

12:40.233 --> 12:43.623
What was so damn important
it couldn't wait?

12:43.713 --> 12:46.750
- Sally.
- Sally? Sally who?

12:48.953 --> 12:49.353
Sally.

12:49.353 --> 12:51.025
Sally.

12:53.233 --> 12:55.827
Is he dead?

12:55.913 --> 12:59.223
Do I look like I'm dead?
Do I sound like I'm dead?

13:00.993 --> 13:03.587
Criminy, I thought you said she was an X5.

13:03.673 --> 13:04.867
X5.

13:04.953 --> 13:06.944
What happened?

13:07.033 --> 13:09.831
All you need to know, dollface,
is I had an accident.

13:09.913 --> 13:14.907
Being a Manticore alum myself, I can't exactly
beat feet to the emergency room now, can I?

13:15.033 --> 13:17.342
- You're a Nomlie.
- An anomaly?

13:17.433 --> 13:21.551
Hell, no. I'm exactly what they wanted.
Designed with cartilage instead of bone.

13:21.633 --> 13:26.661
Good news is I don't fracture in battle.
Bad news, I get bent out of shape sometimes.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.904
I guess.

13:28.993 --> 13:33.748
Well, don't just stand there gawking like
a couple of chuckleheads. Do something.

13:35.073 --> 13:40.670
I'll immobilise his upper body while
you rotate his head back into position.

13:44.393 --> 13:47.908
I'll move his shoulders this way.
You move his head the other way.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.268
Put your back into it.
I haven't got all night.

13:50.353 --> 13:52.025
On three.

13:52.113 --> 13:54.991
One, two, three.

13:57.713 --> 14:00.181
Now you've done it.

14:07.353 --> 14:09.992
This can't be happening.

14:10.073 --> 14:14.669
You never seen a soldier whose body parts
are self-sustaining and regenerative?

14:14.753 --> 14:17.586
Starfish. Starfish in his cocktail.

14:17.673 --> 14:20.506
I can take a direct mortar hit and shake it off.

14:20.953 --> 14:22.750
Incoming!

14:28.113 --> 14:30.263
What are you doing?
Get your ass back here!

14:30.353 --> 14:32.787
What can I do? Body's got a mind of its own.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.865
Rover doesn't have a prayer.
I run like the wind, baby.

14:37.993 --> 14:41.747
- Body's gone. Very fast.
- Like I said.

14:41.833 --> 14:46.384
We gotta do something fast. I don't need
a headless transgenic on the loose.

14:46.473 --> 14:48.065
Max!

14:50.753 --> 14:52.744
- Where'd you disappear to?
- Rafer...

14:52.833 --> 14:55.825
- Say hi to my friend Joshua.
- Tricks and treats.

14:55.913 --> 14:58.825
Cool costume.

14:58.913 --> 15:02.701
Rafer, I was wondering,
can we borrow your car to run an errand?

15:03.233 --> 15:06.225
- Sure. Yeah, I guess.
- Cool. Meet you out front.

15:10.713 --> 15:13.910
We need reinforcements.
You need to call some people.

15:13.993 --> 15:16.951
- Who?
- Couple of transgenic colleagues are in town.

15:17.033 --> 15:20.025
- Sure that's a good idea?
- Just get me to a phone.

15:22.673 --> 15:25.141
- We set to go?
- In a sec.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.787
They just... I mean...

15:28.873 --> 15:32.582
He just needed to make a phone call...
Joshua needed to make a phone call.

15:34.553 --> 15:37.545
So, you're a paramedic.

15:37.633 --> 15:39.624
Yeah, right.

15:39.713 --> 15:43.911
Cool. You probably see some
really gruesome stuff out there, right?

15:43.993 --> 15:47.463
- Yeah, sometimes.
- Torn-off limbs.

15:47.593 --> 15:49.788
Guts hangin' out.

15:49.873 --> 15:53.229
- Decapitations.
- Not a lot of those, thank God.

15:53.313 --> 15:59.309
But you'd know what to do if someone's
head was off and needed to be put back on?

16:00.153 --> 16:02.144
You could handle it?

16:02.233 --> 16:06.385
Once someone's head comes off,
it pretty much stays off.

16:07.433 --> 16:08.548
Right.

16:09.193 --> 16:11.263
It's ringing.

16:11.353 --> 16:14.311
OK, Lassie, you align the receiver to my ear

16:14.393 --> 16:18.272
so I can communicate with the person
who's going to answer on the other end.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.628
Other way, moron.

16:20.713 --> 16:21.702
Hello?

16:22.553 --> 16:24.703
- Hey, baby, it's me.
- Me, who?

16:24.793 --> 16:26.784
Don't be like that. It's Sally.

16:26.873 --> 16:31.185
You mean Sally who stood me up
for the third time straight last night?

16:31.273 --> 16:34.982
- I'm not talking to him.
- Wait. I will make it up to you later, kitten.

16:35.073 --> 16:38.543
Right now, I'm in a situation,
extreme in nature.

16:38.633 --> 16:40.863
- Get my drift?
- Let me guess.

16:40.953 --> 16:44.866
- The business part of you's run off again?
- Matter of fact, yes.

16:44.953 --> 16:47.228
But I still got man skills, sugar.

16:50.353 --> 16:53.026
Don't even try and get on my good side.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.583
Fun and games aside,
I gotta get the rest of me back, pronto.

16:56.673 --> 16:59.745
Hook me up with your lizard buddy.
We gotta strategise.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.824
Hold on.

17:08.153 --> 17:10.269
- Speak.
- Sally's on the line.

17:10.353 --> 17:14.904
His body's gone AWOL again
and we're putting together a search party.

17:14.992 --> 17:18.622
Sorry. Me and Chad
are going to a Halloween party.

17:18.713 --> 17:21.146
Chad? Who the hell is Chad?

17:21.233 --> 17:23.792
My life partner. And watch your language.

17:23.873 --> 17:27.661
We've been out for three months
and you've already got a life partner?

17:27.752 --> 17:30.142
You never know when love will find you.

17:30.953 --> 17:33.547
Chad's worked on his costume.
I can't let him down.

17:33.633 --> 17:37.069
Listen to me, frog boy.
I'm in a major situation and I need backup.

17:37.153 --> 17:41.465
Tell your life partner you have other plans,
and get your slimy butt in gear.

17:41.553 --> 17:43.942
- Capeesh?
- Gotta blaze.

17:47.753 --> 17:50.711
- So where are we going?
- To meet some friends.

17:50.793 --> 17:53.512
Am I going the right way here?

17:56.073 --> 18:00.032
Good thing I'm without my stomach.
I'd be losing it right about now.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.183
Quiet!

18:02.273 --> 18:06.061
Quiet. The ambulance sure is quiet
without the sirens going.

18:08.433 --> 18:11.709
So, Joshua, you're what?
A Wookiee? A <i>Planet of the Apes</i> guy?

18:13.793 --> 18:16.785
- Special. First.
- First what?

18:18.753 --> 18:24.032
First prize. He won first prize
for his costume at school.

18:24.113 --> 18:27.992
He's an exchange student.
You know, English as a second language.

18:29.033 --> 18:31.149
- Way to go. Where you from?
- Father.

18:31.233 --> 18:35.021
- Father... land.
- I always wanted to visit Germany.

18:35.353 --> 18:37.742
This is gonna be a long night.

18:38.113 --> 18:43.665
- So what kinda errand are we running?
- Looking everywhere.

18:43.753 --> 18:47.632
It's like a tradition in Germany
this time of year to look for stuff.

18:47.713 --> 18:50.705
- Like a scavenger hunt?
- Exactly.

18:50.793 --> 18:53.785
- Kinda like an Oktoberfest thing.
- Exactly.

18:53.873 --> 18:56.467
- I'm down with that.
- Fest thing.

18:57.353 --> 18:59.344
- Stop.
- Where?

19:03.833 --> 19:05.232
Here.

19:09.153 --> 19:13.431
- Are you coming?
- Yeah. My foot fell asleep. I'll be right in.

19:13.513 --> 19:14.912
All right.

19:20.673 --> 19:22.664
I'm suffocating under here.

19:22.753 --> 19:25.506
While we're in there, not one peep outta you.

19:26.473 --> 19:27.872
Easy.

19:29.193 --> 19:30.069
Come on.

19:37.553 --> 19:40.545
Are you guys from Germany too?

19:40.633 --> 19:44.911
Yeah. This is Dieter and Katarina.

19:44.993 --> 19:47.348
Call me Kat.

19:47.433 --> 19:51.824
I thought his costume was great,
but you guys are tight.

19:52.193 --> 19:55.344
What are you?
A desert-acclimated combat soldier?

19:55.433 --> 19:57.993
- Wide receiver.
- Reinforcement.

19:58.073 --> 20:02.544
He means they're part of
our scavenger-hunt team. Right?

20:03.313 --> 20:04.746
- Right.
- Right.

20:09.793 --> 20:12.307
Easy on the caffeine.

20:12.993 --> 20:16.542
- Tonight's special is haggis.
- Haggis? What's haggis?

20:16.913 --> 20:20.906
Heart, liver, lung of a sheep,
minced with suet, onions and oatmeal,

20:20.993 --> 20:24.588
boiled in the animal's stomach.
Comes with fries or coleslaw.

20:25.033 --> 20:26.466
Haggis.

20:28.913 --> 20:31.507
- I'll have the haggis.
- I'll have the haggis.

20:33.033 --> 20:36.503
- Just water.
- Nothing for me, thanks.

20:36.593 --> 20:39.630
Haggis, haggis, haggis,
one water, one nothing.

20:42.113 --> 20:44.547
The sandbox is over there.

20:49.233 --> 20:54.353
Here's the deal. Under no circumstances can
that guy know he's rolling with transgenics.

20:54.433 --> 20:57.266
Mess up and your mutant asses
will be kicked.

20:57.873 --> 20:58.862
Yeah.

21:04.433 --> 21:06.424
Any idea where your body might be?

21:06.513 --> 21:08.583
- Not a clue.
- Think.

21:09.313 --> 21:13.147
Excuse me for being
a little light-headed, no thanks to you.

21:13.233 --> 21:15.622
- I think I'm supposed to meet somebody.
- Who?

21:15.713 --> 21:20.468
A female. Redhead.
Great set of hooters, nice round bubble butt.

21:21.033 --> 21:24.070
- Me and this hottie were meant to hook up.
- Where?

21:24.153 --> 21:27.862
Can't remember. No, wait.
First I'm supposed to get something.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.944
What?

21:30.033 --> 21:33.230
Package. I was waiting for
a delivery but it never showed.

21:33.313 --> 21:38.387
The messenger service closed early,
so I was gonna go get it myself after hours.

21:38.473 --> 21:39.622
Where?

21:39.713 --> 21:43.228
- Some place in Sector Nine.
- Can you be a little more specific?

21:43.313 --> 21:45.781
I can't remember the name.

21:45.873 --> 21:48.751
Jam Clydesdale? Flam Pony?

21:48.833 --> 21:51.142
- Jam Pony?
- Yeah, that's the one.

21:51.233 --> 21:53.110
Oh, my God.

21:54.753 --> 21:58.905
- We gotta blaze.
- Blaze now? Before haggis?

22:01.593 --> 22:06.587
Max, looks like you're hangin' out
with a higher class of people than usual.

22:09.473 --> 22:12.783
- Reagan Ronald's the name.
- Call me Kat.

22:13.873 --> 22:15.864
I'm charmed.

22:17.593 --> 22:21.029
- Cool costume.
- It's not a costume. It's for haggis night.

22:21.113 --> 22:23.502
The <i>spécialité de maison.</i>

22:27.233 --> 22:29.224
I'm sorry. Allergic to cats.

22:29.313 --> 22:35.343
Not that you're really a cat, but just goes
to show you the power of the human mind.

22:35.433 --> 22:37.424
I see a cat, I sneeze.

22:41.393 --> 22:43.509
I can't breathe in here.

22:44.593 --> 22:46.982
- What was that?
- Dieter can throw his voice.

22:47.073 --> 22:49.826
He's a scream at parties.

22:50.793 --> 22:54.991
- Can you make that salt shaker talk too?
- What a moron.

22:55.073 --> 22:57.712
Better keep practising.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.512
- We're outta here.
- I thought people wanted haggis.

23:00.593 --> 23:03.312
They ran out. See ya.

23:03.393 --> 23:05.987
Great to meet you.

23:14.553 --> 23:16.393
- Be right back.
- What are you hunting for here?

23:16.393 --> 23:16.791
- Be right back.
- What are you hunting for here?

23:16.873 --> 23:19.228
- Ming vase.
- Saxophone.

23:20.033 --> 23:24.151
You know, one of those
14th-century royal Chinese saxophones?

23:25.273 --> 23:27.468
Don't you wanna go with 'em?

23:31.193 --> 23:33.707
You remind me of my friend Chad.

23:36.073 --> 23:40.146
- How big's your package?
- Let's just say I don't get any complaints.

23:40.233 --> 23:43.748
How'd you like me to pluck out your eyes?
Tell me what I'm looking for.

23:43.833 --> 23:45.903
A package. That's all I know.

23:46.793 --> 23:49.182
Everybody take a pile.

23:53.553 --> 23:56.943
- This way, everyone.
- It's Reagan Ronald.

24:06.833 --> 24:09.631
Let's go. Hurry up. Let's go!

24:12.513 --> 24:16.665
OK, gather round.
Clear the way.

24:16.753 --> 24:20.109
I'm pleased to announce
our greatest fears have been realised.

24:20.193 --> 24:22.832
Mutant transgenic monsters live among us.

24:22.913 --> 24:27.429
I surreptitiously photographed these fiends
earlier on this evening.

24:27.513 --> 24:32.223
Unfortunately, my undercover activities
force me to relinquish my post here.

24:32.393 --> 24:36.386
While I was out, a headless mutant
broke in and stole a package.

24:36.473 --> 24:39.271
Surveillance video caught the entire thing.

24:41.793 --> 24:45.069
Is there a cat in here?
Did someone bring a cat in here?

24:52.913 --> 24:57.429
The package that this headless mutant
absconded with, do we know what was in it?

24:57.513 --> 25:00.949
No, we do not. However,
in this vermin's haste to flee,

25:01.033 --> 25:06.630
he dropped a piece of paper which reads:
"Be at the coordinates at 10pm."

25:09.953 --> 25:10.713
I hate cats. Vile creatures.

25:10.713 --> 25:12.465
I hate cats. Vile creatures.

25:12.553 --> 25:16.944
They're always sleepin'
and lickin' themselves.

25:19.993 --> 25:21.506
Lovely.

25:23.153 --> 25:27.112
As for this headless mutant,
he will not succeed in his nefarious mission.

25:27.193 --> 25:30.788
While I coordinate operations here at HQ,

25:30.873 --> 25:35.424
you will scour the night, you will find him,
and beat him into a transgenic paste.

25:35.513 --> 25:40.951
But first, cake and ice cream upstairs. Yeah?
An army marches on its stomach.

25:48.193 --> 25:52.266
- What a loon.
- What does that mean, meet at 10pm?

25:52.353 --> 25:55.470
Got me. I told you, I was planning
on hookin' up with that redhead.

25:55.553 --> 25:58.704
Where? Talk fast or the left eye goes first.

25:58.793 --> 26:03.264
Some bar. Munch? Crunch? Smash? Rash?

26:03.353 --> 26:05.662
- Crash?
- That's the one.

26:05.753 --> 26:07.744
This just gets better and better.

26:17.153 --> 26:22.591
What are you looking for here? Waffle iron,
ukulele, stuffed moose head, whatever.

26:22.673 --> 26:27.747
It's not even like that. We're playing by
German rules. Can you get me a beer?

26:27.833 --> 26:30.222
Yeah. One brewski coming up.

26:39.873 --> 26:43.548
Look at my girl, comin' correct
and takin' Joshua for a night on the town.

26:43.633 --> 26:46.227
That is so not what's happening.

26:47.433 --> 26:49.867
Hey, brown sugar, what's cookin'?

26:49.953 --> 26:53.229
Sweet baby Jesus! Tell me
I did not see what I just saw.

26:58.273 --> 27:00.707
Hold this. I'll be right back.

27:09.153 --> 27:11.462
Thought you were trackin' down a hit man.

27:11.553 --> 27:13.828
Excuse me?

27:13.913 --> 27:17.701
Sorry. Have you two
seen a headless body around?

27:18.233 --> 27:20.508
Back room.

27:36.513 --> 27:40.392
Max, just been discussing
the mutant infestation with your boy here.

27:40.473 --> 27:42.862
Not right now, Sketch!

27:53.513 --> 27:57.870
- Alpha leader. Come in, alpha leader.
- Roger. This is alpha leader. Over.

27:57.953 --> 28:00.626
This isn't Roger. This is Sketchy.

28:00.713 --> 28:04.342
"Roger" is an acknowledgment
in the affirmative, not a name, moron.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.901
How many times have I told you?
Say "over". Over.

28:06.993 --> 28:10.349
- Acknowledged. Over over.
- No, not "over over".

28:10.433 --> 28:14.665
- "Over." Over.
- That's what I just said. Over over.

28:14.753 --> 28:18.143
Oh, God. Never mind.
What have you got for me? Over.

28:18.233 --> 28:21.782
The headless mutant transgenic
male Caucasian subject just left,

28:21.873 --> 28:23.989
armed with a sniper rifle.

28:24.073 --> 28:26.303
The others went after him. Over over.

28:26.393 --> 28:29.988
Roger. Guess we know
what was in that package he was after.

28:31.193 --> 28:33.388
All right, this is alpha leader. Clear.

28:33.473 --> 28:36.067
You forgot to say "over over". Over over.

28:37.033 --> 28:38.386
Nitwit.

28:42.073 --> 28:45.861
- Why are we chasing this guy?
- That rifle he's got, we need it to win.

28:45.953 --> 28:49.832
- Other team.
- Isn't that weird for a scavenger hunt?

28:49.913 --> 28:52.302
German rules. Step on it!

28:56.753 --> 28:58.903
What?

28:58.993 --> 29:01.109
We're outta gas.

29:03.833 --> 29:06.347
Great. Just great.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.344
Thanks, guys.

29:22.913 --> 29:25.302
OK, talk. Why's your body packin' heat?

29:25.393 --> 29:28.112
Seattle's a rough town.
Maybe I wanted protection.

29:28.193 --> 29:30.548
A rifle as protection? Try again.

29:31.713 --> 29:34.705
You'll never get it out of me.

29:38.073 --> 29:39.950
Fine. Fine.

29:40.033 --> 29:42.069
- I'm in town on a mission.
- A mission?

29:42.153 --> 29:44.713
For Manticore.

29:44.793 --> 29:47.387
Manticore's gone. Finito. Kaput.

29:47.473 --> 29:49.782
No more missions?

29:49.873 --> 29:52.751
- For any of us?
- Your mission from now on is to lay low,

29:52.833 --> 29:57.224
which is why we can't have this idiot
running around waving an assault rifle.

29:57.313 --> 30:01.909
Manticore or no, I take pride in my work.
And Mr Lemkin expects the job to be done.

30:01.993 --> 30:04.826
Lemkin? Pierpont Lemkin?

30:05.993 --> 30:08.632
I can't believe I just said that.

30:08.713 --> 30:10.783
You're the hit man Logan talked about.

30:12.873 --> 30:15.546
Lemkin. Lemkin. Lumps in my Lemkin!

30:15.633 --> 30:17.624
Give me that.

30:18.833 --> 30:22.189
How can your body work
without the rest of it tagging along?

30:22.273 --> 30:24.787
Muscle memory.
I trained for months for this job.

30:24.873 --> 30:28.627
- Who's the target?
- No way. I've said too much already.

30:30.073 --> 30:33.065
- Now you listen to me...
- OK, we're good to go.

30:38.193 --> 30:41.822
- Change of plan. We're going to Logan's.
- Your ex-boyfriend's house?

30:41.913 --> 30:46.031
He's not my ex-boyfriend.
I mean, we're not like that.

30:47.873 --> 30:50.341
- <i>My Girl.</i>
- <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

30:50.433 --> 30:52.424
<i>Pretty Woman.</i>

30:56.833 --> 30:58.824
<i>Little Women.</i>

31:00.633 --> 31:02.624
I read that.

31:03.913 --> 31:05.904
Beth dies.

31:10.753 --> 31:13.551
- So I'm thinkin' my head is your hit man.
- Could be.

31:13.633 --> 31:15.908
We still need to figure out who the victim is.

31:15.993 --> 31:18.188
- Good luck.
- Zip it!

31:20.193 --> 31:21.513
- <i>Tokyo Decadence.</i>
- <i>Idle Hands.</i>

31:21.513 --> 31:22.343
- <i>Tokyo Decadence.</i>
- <i>Idle Hands.</i>

31:22.433 --> 31:24.469
- <i>Born Free.</i>
- No.

31:24.953 --> 31:27.262
<i>Faster, Pussycat! Kill, Kill, Kill!</i>

31:28.913 --> 31:32.303
- Look at me. Look at Joshua!
- <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail.</i>

31:32.393 --> 31:34.224
- Bingo.
- Found something?

31:34.313 --> 31:36.349
No, I got bingo.

31:36.433 --> 31:39.982
How is this going to help us find the target?

31:40.073 --> 31:41.472
Yeah.

31:45.473 --> 31:47.703
Good work. Thanks.

31:48.233 --> 31:53.227
My informant. According to him, the target
is either a priest, a minister or a rabbi.

31:53.313 --> 31:58.546
- I feel like I've heard this joke before.
- It's not a joke. A man's life is at stake.

31:58.633 --> 32:04.469
Father McAllister, Reverend Beckwith and
Rabbi Stutz are outspoken religious leaders.

32:04.553 --> 32:07.590
Any of them could've tangled
with Lemkin and bought this hit.

32:07.673 --> 32:12.224
- You can't narrow it down any more?
- Not unless that head starts talkin'.

32:16.073 --> 32:20.464
Let me break it down for you, Sally. Tell me
what you know, or you're in a world of hurt.

32:20.553 --> 32:24.341
- I can take anything you dish out.
- Yeah? You ever had a swirlie?

32:32.993 --> 32:35.223
You ready to talk, Sally?

32:45.553 --> 32:48.351
Max, what are you doing?

32:50.153 --> 32:52.269
All right, all right!

32:52.353 --> 32:55.550
I'll tell ya. It's the priest - Father McAllister.

32:55.633 --> 32:56.748
That's a...

32:56.833 --> 33:00.951
Battery-operated, voice-activated
animatronic head. Realistic, isn't it?

33:01.033 --> 33:02.022
Yeah.

33:06.273 --> 33:09.470
There's a perfectly simple
explanation for this.

33:09.553 --> 33:11.384
Boo!

33:11.473 --> 33:13.862
I've had enough of you.

33:19.913 --> 33:22.302
Head... talking.

33:23.273 --> 33:25.343
- No body.
- It's OK, man.

33:25.433 --> 33:27.424
We're all friends here.

33:30.393 --> 33:35.786
Wait a minute. You're not really German
exchange students on a scavenger hunt.

33:37.473 --> 33:39.987
You're monsters.

33:40.913 --> 33:44.701
Rafer, I had a real nice time. Call me.

33:47.193 --> 33:50.230
OK, team, we're moving out.
Can you keep Rafer entertained?

33:50.313 --> 33:53.510
- No problem.
- Let's go. Come on, kitty.

34:11.513 --> 34:16.507
Logan says Father McAllister's receiving
a humanitarian award on Sunday night.

34:16.592 --> 34:18.902
- Father?
- Different Father. Stay with me.

34:18.993 --> 34:23.464
Tonight there's a run-through. Not much
security. Perfect opportunity for a hit.

34:23.553 --> 34:27.944
We need to search the place top to bottom.
Joshua, you take the basement.

34:28.033 --> 34:30.945
Joshua in basement. Always the plan.

34:31.033 --> 34:36.391
Fine, take the roof. You take the basement.
You handle backstage. I'll do the catwalks.

34:36.473 --> 34:39.670
I think I might be better suited
to handle the catwalks.

34:39.753 --> 34:42.505
How about you do what I say
and we don't have a problem?

34:42.592 --> 34:44.982
- Catfight.
- Let's get moving.

35:52.313 --> 35:55.225
We walk over to the podium
where I am to accept my award.

35:55.313 --> 35:57.383
Well-deserved, I might add.

35:57.473 --> 36:01.261
I wait till the applause dies down,
then I give my acceptance speech.

36:01.353 --> 36:05.471
And I promise you, there won't be
a dry eye in the house.

36:06.073 --> 36:08.541
Come on, come on.
What are you waiting for?

36:12.193 --> 36:16.948
- Father McAllister, over here.
- Who's that calling my name?

36:18.673 --> 36:23.030
A great admirer of yours.
How about an autograph, Your Eminence?

36:32.593 --> 36:34.584
Let me go!

36:35.473 --> 36:37.862
Just kick her ass.

36:54.033 --> 36:58.026
So this was some kind of
drunken Halloween fraternity prank?

36:58.113 --> 37:00.149
Apparently so, Your Worship.

37:00.233 --> 37:04.704
That hooligan was intending to egg you
as part of a pagan initiation ritual.

37:04.793 --> 37:08.832
Thank you, my children,
for putting a stop to his heathen plan.

37:08.913 --> 37:12.428
- Don't thank her, Your Godliness.
- Thank us. We saved you.

37:12.513 --> 37:14.504
Now just hold the phone.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.509
- I'm Eyes Only.
- I'm supreme commandant of S1W.

37:18.593 --> 37:20.390
Saints preserve us.

37:20.473 --> 37:23.704
When you have a moment,
Your Cleanliness, would you marry us?

37:23.793 --> 37:26.705
It would be my privilege, my son.

37:28.193 --> 37:29.433
There they are, constables! Do your duty!

37:29.433 --> 37:30.502
There they are, constables! Do your duty!

37:30.593 --> 37:34.586
Pardon the interruption, Your Significance,
but these people are monsters.

37:34.673 --> 37:36.868
Max, get away.

37:37.473 --> 37:40.271
- Max...
- No, he wasn't hurting anybody.

37:40.353 --> 37:43.345
And what do you know about it?
Are you one of them?

37:54.953 --> 37:57.183
Well, answer him, Max.

38:01.113 --> 38:03.866
No, I'm not one of them.

38:03.953 --> 38:06.148
Then move along
and mind your own business.

38:06.233 --> 38:07.951
Max...

38:16.113 --> 38:18.502
All I wanted was a normal night out.

38:21.193 --> 38:24.981
But I guess, for a girl like me,
normal is just too much to ask.

38:26.513 --> 38:27.946
The thing is...

38:28.033 --> 38:29.432
Boo!

38:30.113 --> 38:33.503
- What are you doin' here?
- Checkin' in on you.

38:35.513 --> 38:38.107
Poor Joshua's gonna spend his life in a cage.

38:38.193 --> 38:41.503
- I know. It's all my fault.
- Got that right.

38:42.433 --> 38:46.062
Max and Joshua,
outside with up-here people.

38:46.153 --> 38:49.111
- Wanna end up in a cage?
- What's the worst that could happen?

38:50.233 --> 38:53.782
- What the hell was that?
- Flashback. Happens all the time.

38:53.873 --> 38:56.103
Thought I was trippin' there.

38:56.193 --> 38:59.390
This whole evening's
been one great big nightmare.

39:00.393 --> 39:03.749
But the worst part wasn't
some talking head in a bag,

39:03.833 --> 39:08.827
or Nomlies eatin' haggis, or even
Joshua gettin' hauled off by the po-po's.

39:09.953 --> 39:12.387
It was my girl denying who she really is.

39:13.073 --> 39:15.223
Denying the people that she loves.

39:16.393 --> 39:20.272
Sugar, that's the worst thing
that you ever coulda done.

39:20.353 --> 39:23.265
That's the worst thing
that coulda happened.

39:26.073 --> 39:28.826
But can I ask you one question?

39:28.913 --> 39:31.302
Where are your clothes?

39:37.353 --> 39:39.071
Boo.

39:39.153 --> 39:40.552
Hey!

39:42.753 --> 39:45.506
What are you gonna be
for Halloween? A prune?

39:47.273 --> 39:49.833
I just had the weirdest dream.

39:49.913 --> 39:53.303
Put some clothes on.
You're gonna be late for the party at Crash.

39:53.393 --> 39:56.385
And your boy Rafer is waitin' on your ass.

39:57.753 --> 40:01.905
Tell him I couldn't make it.
There's something I gotta do.

40:05.913 --> 40:08.143
Hey, big fella.

40:08.233 --> 40:10.224
What ya doin'?

40:10.873 --> 40:12.864
Lay low.

40:12.953 --> 40:14.944
I've been thinkin'.

40:15.033 --> 40:20.665
You and me aren't like other people. We're
different, and nothing's gonna change that.

40:20.753 --> 40:23.551
Joshua and Max, different.

40:23.633 --> 40:26.864
Yeah. Some people might even call us freaks.

40:27.953 --> 40:29.511
Freaks.

40:31.313 --> 40:34.111
Which is why we gotta stick together.

40:36.393 --> 40:38.827
So I'm gonna take you out.

40:40.433 --> 40:42.993
Even if it's just for one night.

40:44.313 --> 40:46.304
Come on.

40:47.713 --> 40:51.626
- Tricks and treats?
- What's the worst that could happen?

41:05.233 --> 41:07.224
Cool costume.

41:54.513 --> 41:57.346
