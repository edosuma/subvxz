WEBVTT

00:01.401 --> 00:05.030
Why are you breaking up with me?
We've been going out for two weeks.

00:05.105 --> 00:07.869
And I've never
had a girlfriend for two weeks.

00:07.941 --> 00:12.071
I believe in dreams. And last night, I
had a dream that you were with Lindsay.

00:12.145 --> 00:14.511
She was all over you
and you were all over her.

00:14.581 --> 00:17.141
But that was a dream.
I was at the movies last night.

00:17.250 --> 00:20.344
Check. Call Kevin.
No. Call Tyler.

00:21.054 --> 00:24.319
It's too late, Kyle.
You can't take back a dream.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.386
Hey, Bridget. Hey, Kyle.

00:30.463 --> 00:31.794
Kyle!

00:31.865 --> 00:32.991
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:33.066 --> 00:34.226
What is going on here?

00:34.334 --> 00:37.394
Uh... It's... it's OK, Papa H.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.836
No, please call me Mr. Hennessey.

00:39.906 --> 00:41.840
- G to G.
- Pardon me?

00:41.908 --> 00:42.875
Got to go.

00:43.543 --> 00:47.411
Got to go? And he's leaving?
G to G? That's the code?

00:47.480 --> 00:49.641
You say that and he leaves?
Kyle, G to G.

00:51.818 --> 00:54.753
That was so rude!
Would I do that to one of your friends?

00:54.821 --> 00:57.187
My house. Cate!

00:57.257 --> 01:01.751
Cate! You had a daughter downstairs
alone with a boy on a couch!

01:02.395 --> 01:03.362
Cate!

01:04.230 --> 01:07.393
- Dad!
- I'm sorry. Where's your mom?

01:07.467 --> 01:10.163
- She went out.
- Dad, you so embarrassed me!

01:10.236 --> 01:13.296
- You know the rules.
- So does Kerry. Gonna say anything?

01:13.373 --> 01:16.831
Oh, sorry. Hi, I'm Paul Hennessey,
Kerry's dad.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.572
- I'm Guy, Kerry's study partner.
- Nice to meet you.

01:19.646 --> 01:23.309
Amazing. I'm sitting on a couch
with a boy, and you go psycho Dad.

01:23.383 --> 01:25.510
She's in bed with him
and you do nothing?

01:25.585 --> 01:28.486
We're on the bed, not in the bed.
Learn a preposition.

01:29.956 --> 01:32.049
We were just studying biology.

01:32.125 --> 01:35.617
That's it. Just... just bio...
I gotta go.

01:36.696 --> 01:39.529
- It was nice meeting everybody.
- Yeah.

01:39.599 --> 01:40.566
Bye.

01:40.667 --> 01:44.797
- Bridget, you totally chased Guy away!
- Dad chased Kyle away, so we're even.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.930
Wait, what kinda name is Guy?

01:47.006 --> 01:49.702
- It's French. He's French Canadian.
- Ew.

01:49.776 --> 01:53.542
Bridget, one world.
French Canadian?

01:54.347 --> 01:55.473
Sorry, sorry.

01:56.649 --> 02:00.278
Kerry was obviously studying.
I don't have to worry about her.

02:00.353 --> 02:02.116
- What?
- I've done that trick.

02:02.222 --> 02:05.123
You lay books and papers around
just in case you come in.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.751
- Really?
- No.

02:08.828 --> 02:11.956
- You don't have to worry about me?
- You don't understand.

02:12.031 --> 02:16.092
You're the good guy in this scenario.
When the dust settles, I want credit.

02:16.169 --> 02:19.036
- Why do you think I'm always good?
- So I'm the bad girl?

02:20.974 --> 02:24.501
What's it called when you're damned
if you do, damned if you don't?

02:24.577 --> 02:26.101
Oh, yes, fatherhood.

02:27.914 --> 02:30.439
Maybe I was
laying books around to fool you.

02:30.517 --> 02:33.350
- It's not hard.
- Is that what you want me to believe?

02:33.419 --> 02:36.183
Don't worry, Dad.
They weren't messing around.

02:37.857 --> 02:39.620
Wait, this isn't my room.

02:39.692 --> 02:40.659
- What!
- Get out!

02:40.760 --> 02:43.729
- Get out of here!
- Rory!

02:45.000 --> 02:51.074

03:02.582 --> 03:06.484
Kerry, sweetie, take a look at this.
I think you'll like it.

03:06.553 --> 03:09.818
- Whatcha reading?
- Rule of the Bone by Russell Banks.

03:09.889 --> 03:13.985
God, he writes with such
a measured rage. What's that?

03:15.828 --> 03:19.696
It's my column on how dogs
start to look like their owners.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.025
I don't know,
maybe now's not the time.

03:23.102 --> 03:25.070
Rory, shouldn't you be in bed?

03:25.171 --> 03:28.902
I can't sleep. I'm worried 'cause...

03:28.975 --> 03:32.411
...'cause Bridget's not home yet
and it's past her curfew.

03:35.882 --> 03:39.147
Well, Rory, son,
that's not worrying, that's tattling.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.880
And I thank you.

03:42.956 --> 03:47.017
OK, there she is now.
Bridget is starting to take advantage.

03:47.093 --> 03:51.655
Her curfew is 11:30.
Not 11:35 or 11:37.

03:51.764 --> 03:55.495
- You know where this is leading?
- 11:40?

03:55.568 --> 03:58.093
Not on my watch.
I'm gonna have a talk with Kyle.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.832
She broke up with Kyle today.

03:59.906 --> 04:03.774
- She broke up with Kyle?
- Yeah, she's out with some jock.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.811
So she's done grieving.

04:06.846 --> 04:09.679
Yeah, some basketball player.
I hate them.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.910
White boys thinking they're all ghetto.

04:11.985 --> 04:15.751
"I'm a baller, holla!
Holla back, brotha, uh-huh."

04:17.089 --> 04:19.320
I hate it when they do that.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.826
- Hi, honey.
- I thought you were Bridget.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.489
Bridget? She's on the front porch
with her date.

04:25.598 --> 04:29.898
It is 11:37 and she's past her curfew.

04:29.969 --> 04:32.938
Well, by a few minutes.
Can't you be a little flexible?

04:33.039 --> 04:34.370
What's the big deal?

04:34.440 --> 04:37.409
It was a big deal
when we negotiated this.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.944
I wanted 10:30. You said midnight.

04:40.013 --> 04:43.073
I said 11. But the girls
wanted two holes in each ear.

04:43.149 --> 04:47.609
So we settled on 11:30,
one hole in the ear.

04:48.688 --> 04:51.384
I was there, Paul.
I took the minutes.

04:51.457 --> 04:54.756
I can't believe it! Look, it's 11:38.

04:54.827 --> 04:58.285
- You were always in by curfew?
- Always!

04:58.364 --> 05:00.298
- Really, Mom?
- No way.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.497
I just don't like to bring
my exes up to your father.

05:03.569 --> 05:07.505
He's all, "Was he cuter than me,
was he cuter than me?"

05:07.573 --> 05:09.234
I'm just too tired.

05:10.376 --> 05:14.278
- Was who cuter than me?
- No one, honey. No one.

05:14.347 --> 05:17.282
Thank God that we have one kid
we don't have to worry about.

05:17.350 --> 05:20.319
There you go again!
You don't have to worry about me

05:20.386 --> 05:22.854
just 'cause I'm not
Miss Blonde Bobble Head?

05:22.922 --> 05:25.356
"Like, oh, my God,
my name's Bridget.

05:25.425 --> 05:28.986
I can't believe how much
my head shakes when I talk."

05:37.870 --> 05:40.338
That's... that's really mean.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.369
Really, really mean.

05:45.712 --> 05:48.806
Maybe I'm sneakier about my boyfriends.
Ever think of that?

05:48.881 --> 05:51.315
You are too young.
We have rules about that.

05:51.384 --> 05:54.683
- Well, ooh-la-la.
- Is that French?

05:56.622 --> 06:00.058
Dad, I'm getting real worried.

06:01.427 --> 06:03.395
Bridget still hasn't come in yet.

06:03.463 --> 06:06.762
Enough, you already
have the job. Upstairs.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.569
Daddy! Don't you knock?

06:15.508 --> 06:17.976
Bridget, time to come in!

06:18.044 --> 06:20.911
Honey, wipe your feet,
take off the boy.

06:22.849 --> 06:27.411
Hi. Paul "Hit-man" Hennessey.
You might have seen some of my fights.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.011
I didn't catch your name,
don't really care to.

06:30.089 --> 06:31.818
Travis Smith.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.587
Travis Smith?
You're the basketball player?

06:34.660 --> 06:36.025
- Yeah.
- He's a baller.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.290
- Holla.
- Holla back, brotha.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.763
Uh-huh.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.895
- No flirting.
- No problem.

06:43.970 --> 06:48.873
Cate, you didn't tell me Bridget
was going out with The Rainman.

06:49.642 --> 06:52.372
The Rainman. Wow.

06:52.445 --> 06:56.211
- Who's The Rainman?
- Travis. He rains down three-pointers.

06:56.282 --> 06:58.910
This guy is the best guard
in the state.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.715
He's the son of Steve Smith.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.756
"Canned Heat" Smith. Ring any bells?

07:03.856 --> 07:07.348
- No.
- Ace pitcher for the Detroit Tigers.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.396
What, you live under a rock?

07:10.463 --> 07:12.624
No, but I'm willing to move.

07:13.533 --> 07:16.263
The Smiths are Michigan sports royalty.

07:16.335 --> 07:19.429
- Smith is a big name in Michigan.
- I think I've heard of it.

07:19.505 --> 07:23.669
Hey, can I get you kids anything?

07:24.444 --> 07:27.880
Un, Daddy, I was kinda hoping
Travis could take me out for a bite?

07:27.947 --> 07:29.107
Da!

07:30.283 --> 07:31.910
- Can we, please?
- No.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.509
- Sure.
- Ha, ha. Wait a minute.

07:34.587 --> 07:37.920
Weren't you just discussing
your precious 11:30 rule?

07:37.990 --> 07:40.959
Can't you be a little flexible?
This is a special occasion.

07:41.060 --> 07:44.894
It's not every day my daughter goes out
with the state's leading scorer.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.261
Yeah, lead...

07:50.303 --> 07:52.567
OK, it's 1 am.
Why are you still up?

07:52.638 --> 07:55.004
I couldn't wait to hear
all about your date.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.542
Well, there's not much to it.
We went to the...

07:58.144 --> 07:59.634
Shut up.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.171
I am so angry at Dad.

08:02.248 --> 08:06.480
He thinks of me as some sort
of virgin spinster, like Miss Havisham.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.050
Great Expectations?

08:10.389 --> 08:11.686
Charles Dickens?

08:12.725 --> 08:14.090
A book.

08:16.195 --> 08:19.426
Hardee's was closed so we went
to get ice cream at The Parlor.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.332
Dad didn't even wait up for me.
So cool. How are my abs?

08:22.401 --> 08:23.959
Perfect.

08:24.036 --> 08:26.971
- So you like this Guy guy?
- He's like a friend.

08:27.039 --> 08:29.803
- Not like you and Travis.
- Travis? No, he's OK.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.344
I went out with him
because Lindsay liked him.

08:32.410 --> 08:35.174
When she gave me this top back
it was all stretched out

08:35.248 --> 08:39.014
and had a stain from a party she wasn't
going to because I wasn't invited.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.847
Nice try, Linds.

08:43.356 --> 08:47.690
Wow. So, OK, you're not
going out with him again?

08:47.760 --> 08:50.194
Oh, I'm going out with him again.
Dad loves him.

08:50.263 --> 08:54.097
He lets me stay out as late as I want.
It is a whole other world past 11:30.

08:54.166 --> 08:57.727
Hardee's is closed,
but there are other places.

08:58.404 --> 09:02.670
- Isn't that like using someone?
- Uh, yeah.

09:02.742 --> 09:06.701
Little sister, you have much to learn.
Why Dad thinks you're the book girl.

09:06.812 --> 09:09.679
OK, well, from now on
I am Madame Bovary.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.683
Another book girl.

09:13.553 --> 09:17.319
I'm gonna act like you
in front of Dad and freak him out.

09:17.423 --> 09:18.981
Ohhh!

09:19.058 --> 09:20.616
That's good.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.156
Hennessy!

09:28.234 --> 09:30.600
Tommy, hey.
Listen, I gotta go. Sorry.

09:33.339 --> 09:35.807
There something on your mind, Tom?

09:35.875 --> 09:37.900
Do you see fear in my eyes?

09:38.844 --> 09:40.209
- No.
- Because it's hate!

09:40.313 --> 09:41.405
What's wrong?

09:41.480 --> 09:45.041
What's wrong? Your little girl,
Barbarella, broke my son's heart.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.881
My baby boy, Kyle, is devastated.

09:47.954 --> 09:50.684
Found somebody better, she says?
Nobody's better.

09:50.756 --> 09:55.887
- Not in this life, buddy.
- She is starting to see Travis Smith.

09:55.962 --> 10:00.524
I don't care if she's starting to see...
Travis Smith, The Rainman?

10:00.633 --> 10:03.261
- Yeah!
- Our Bridget is dating The Rainman?

10:03.336 --> 10:06.237
It's getting serious.
He was even over at the house.

10:06.305 --> 10:07.329
Oh, yeah.

10:07.406 --> 10:09.897
- Hey, Papa H.
- Oh, shut up.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.705
Kyle.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.211
- Why isn't Kyle in school?
- There's no school.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.646
- It's Take Your Kid to Work Day.
- No, it's not.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.377
- No, it's not!
- Dad!

10:19.885 --> 10:22.046
So Kyle's really upset?

10:22.121 --> 10:25.249
Throwing up, crying,
sleeping under the bed.

10:25.324 --> 10:28.555
Never mind that now.
Are you kidding me? That's so great.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.495
See if your daughter
can make him commit to Michigan.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.794
- Take us to the Final Four.
- I'll do my best.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.925
- I'm talking about her best.
- Hey!

10:36.002 --> 10:38.266
- You follow?
- That's my baby girl.

10:38.337 --> 10:40.703
- Well...
- My baby girl dating Travis Smith!

10:40.806 --> 10:43.707
That's what I'm saying.

10:47.146 --> 10:51.708
- Can I sit in the cart?
- No! Now go get the popcorn.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.820
- Hi, Kerry.
- Guy, what are you doing here?

10:57.890 --> 11:03.021
- You told me to meet you here.
- Nice try, Madame Ovary.

11:03.095 --> 11:06.531
- What?
- It's a book, Dad.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.126
Guy, let's get out of here.
Come on.

11:09.201 --> 11:10.759
Harmless.

11:10.870 --> 11:14.897
- Travis!
- Travis is here? Oh, my God.

11:14.974 --> 11:18.808
What is with you? You've got
a man crush on Bridget's boyfriend.

11:18.878 --> 11:22.336
No, it's his father.
I mean, he's with his father.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.348
Mr. and Mrs. Hennessy,
this is my dad.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.785
- Steve Smith.
- No, I'm Steve Smith.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.489
No, I meant I'm Paul.

11:31.557 --> 11:34.526
- You used to cover the Tigers.
- For a couple of years.

11:34.593 --> 11:36.857
A few seasons in the sun.

11:36.929 --> 11:39.864
Now he writes the column
where Peanuts used to be.

11:39.932 --> 11:42.799
- Excuse me. Is this your wife?
- Yes. Cate, Steve Smith.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.597
- Hi.
- Mr. Canned Heat.

11:44.670 --> 11:46.570
[Kerry giggling] Stop it.

11:46.639 --> 11:50.871
Sounds to me like we got a little hein'
and shein' going on in aisle three,

11:50.943 --> 11:52.501
if you catch my drift.

11:52.578 --> 11:56.036
That's just my little girl Kerry
with her study buddy.

11:56.115 --> 12:00.245
- Study buddy?
- I didn't do anything.

12:00.319 --> 12:02.344
I gotta go.

12:02.421 --> 12:04.855
So cute.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.017
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

12:07.093 --> 12:08.424
Bridget is a great girl.

12:08.494 --> 12:11.156
- You got a hell of a son.
- Yeah, boys are great.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.393
That's my little fella over there
sitting in the cart.

12:14.467 --> 12:18.028
- The one that's stuck?
- He'll be fine.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.265
- See you around?
- An honor to meet you.

12:20.339 --> 12:21.306
Just an honor.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.534
- Take care.
- You too. Bye-bye.

12:23.943 --> 12:28.312
- Could Travis and I hang out tonight?
- No, it's family movie night.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.382
Well, she could miss it just once.

12:30.449 --> 12:32.781
Paul, it's also a school night.

12:32.852 --> 12:36.083
- Oh, I forgot it's a school night.
- Please?

12:36.722 --> 12:39.452
Oh, hell, she doesn't study.
Go have a good time.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.029
Details, please?

12:50.102 --> 12:53.469
Uh, last night? Three parties.
Stayed out till 12:30.

12:53.539 --> 12:56.099
Tonight, we'll go to the dance
and an after party.

12:56.175 --> 12:58.939
I'm pushing for 2am.
A personal best.

12:59.712 --> 13:00.045
What about you? Details, please?

13:00.045 --> 13:02.138
What about you? Details, please?

13:02.214 --> 13:04.182
I'm going to the dance too.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.014
No, I mean, what's with you
and this Guy guy?

13:07.119 --> 13:10.816
Our father has to be
the dumbest man that ever lived.

13:11.390 --> 13:14.359
Then why is he always on my case
when I get a C?

13:18.364 --> 13:21.731
I am practically throwing myself
all over Guy and he's, like,

13:21.834 --> 13:24.962
"Cute, so cute.
Aren't they cute, Cate?"

13:25.037 --> 13:28.336
Hmm. Maybe Guy's the problem.
Maybe you need another prop.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.842
That is so mean.

13:32.645 --> 13:37.309
Oh, good afternoon, Your Highness.
Is this breakfast or lunch?

13:38.350 --> 13:41.615
- Did you have a good time with Travis?
- Yes, Daddy.

13:41.687 --> 13:44.952
- I had a good time too.
- No you didn't, you were with us.

13:45.024 --> 13:48.551
[phone ringing]

13:48.627 --> 13:51.152
Hello? Steve!

13:51.230 --> 13:53.198
- Is Travis here?
- No.

13:53.265 --> 13:55.790
He wants to talk to me. Yeah.

13:55.868 --> 13:58.166
Uh... just a sec.

13:58.237 --> 13:59.499
- Tonight?
- No.

13:59.572 --> 14:00.937
Yeah, we'd be happy to.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.771
Cool. OK, see you later, partner.

14:04.844 --> 14:09.338
So, I guess that date we've planned is
now dinner with Canned and Mrs. Heat?

14:09.415 --> 14:13.374
Oh, I wish. No, he wanted us to help
chaperone the school dance tonight.

14:13.485 --> 14:16.249
- What could I say?
- How about no?

14:16.355 --> 14:19.290
Paul, this is my first
Saturday night off in weeks.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.919
- I don't wanna chaperone a dance.
- You're gonna chaperone the dance?

14:22.995 --> 14:26.158
We have to. Travis' dad
is in charge of the booster club.

14:26.232 --> 14:27.699
- No.
- No.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.201
Maybe it's time for me
to give a little something back.

14:32.504 --> 14:33.835
Oh, bull.

14:34.740 --> 14:38.232
Maybe I care about children,
while you just want dinner and a movie.

14:38.310 --> 14:40.278
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

14:41.647 --> 14:43.911
You at the dance
is an invasion of privacy.

14:43.983 --> 14:47.350
I'm not gonna bother you and Travis.
You won't know I'm there.

14:47.419 --> 14:51.378
- I want you guys to have fun.
- I don't want you at the dance, either.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.719
Why? What's going down?

14:55.227 --> 14:57.787
If you're there, my social status.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.030
[rock music playing]

15:03.035 --> 15:05.401
OK, stop walking so loud!

15:05.471 --> 15:08.031
I am just as unhappy
about being here as you are.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.836
Why don't you dance
with one of your little friends?

15:10.910 --> 15:14.073
My little friends? Where is Guy?

15:16.081 --> 15:19.050
Hi Mr. H, Mrs. H.

15:19.151 --> 15:21.312
Poor Kyle. He looks so sad.

15:21.420 --> 15:25.447
Yeah. There's Bridget and Travis!
Hey, guys! How are ya?

15:25.524 --> 15:28.857
Listen, I haven't seen your dad around.
I hope he's not sick.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.862
Man crush.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.297
He never comes to these things.
He gets people to volunteer.

15:36.068 --> 15:40.027
So now that Steve has stood you up,
can we please go to a restaurant?

15:40.139 --> 15:41.902
I thought he'd be here.

15:42.641 --> 15:44.074
You're, like, nine.

15:47.980 --> 15:51.279
You know what, honey,
you are right. I'm sorry.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.409
I know what that feels like.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.817
I remember when I met
Dr. Christian Barnard.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.822
The heart guy?
Was he cuter than me?

15:57.890 --> 16:02.156
No. But I was in total awe,
so I know what it's like.

16:02.227 --> 16:05.993
Just don't let your intoxication
get in the way of your parenting.

16:06.098 --> 16:09.556
- Like I'd let that happen.
- Well, don't be so sure.

16:09.635 --> 16:15.096
- Bridget is not above playing you.
- I think I'm a little more savvy.

16:16.742 --> 16:20.769
Have you noticed how many times lately
Bridget has asked you for something

16:20.846 --> 16:24.077
starting with the word "Daddy"?

16:24.149 --> 16:26.117
[Bridget] Daddy?

16:27.386 --> 16:30.947
- Can Travis and I go to a party after?
- What time will you be home?

16:31.056 --> 16:33.354
- I don't know. Late.
- Well...

16:33.425 --> 16:34.722
- Please, Daddy?
- No.

16:34.793 --> 16:36.158
Thanks.

16:36.228 --> 16:40.995
- I said me and Travis, The Rainman.
- I heard what you said.

16:41.100 --> 16:45.469
Your curfew's still 11:30.
Guess what, cupcake? Daddy's back.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.075
Oh, my God, Cate.
Look over there.

16:55.147 --> 16:59.015
- Come on, dance with me.
- No, no. I am not gonna embarrass her.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.245
OK, fine. I'll do it myself.

17:18.337 --> 17:22.898
- This was our date night.
- Mine too.

17:47.166 --> 17:50.727
- Wow, you are a great dancer.
- Thanks.

17:59.144 --> 18:00.907
- What are you doing?
- What?

18:01.013 --> 18:05.473
Well, I just thought that how
cool it is being study partners,

18:05.551 --> 18:08.281
maybe we could go to the next level.

18:10.122 --> 18:12.784
Guy, I like you,

18:12.858 --> 18:14.951
but I just like you as a friend.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.996
But the way you
were dancing with me...

18:19.031 --> 18:21.158
Awww... Forget it.

18:27.206 --> 18:29.731
Dad, stop spying on me!

18:29.808 --> 18:32.276
I wasn't spying.

18:32.344 --> 18:35.677
OK, maybe I was spying at first,
but then I got into the music.

18:35.747 --> 18:39.183
- It's... Are you OK?
- No.

18:40.486 --> 18:43.455
He's a nice guy and I hurt his feelings.

18:44.890 --> 18:45.982
I led him on.

18:47.459 --> 18:51.418
I don't want to be a girl like that.
I hate girls like that.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.863
- I share a room with...
- I know, I know.

18:54.466 --> 18:58.095
So why did you do it?
Just to get a rise out of me?

18:58.170 --> 18:59.797
- Yes!
- Why?

19:00.706 --> 19:04.233
Because I'm tired of you
looking at me like I'm a little girl.

19:05.544 --> 19:09.503
Well, after watching you dance,
I'm sure I won't being doing that again.

19:09.581 --> 19:11.310
Good.

19:11.383 --> 19:14.045
It's nice to be treated
like an adult once in a while.

19:14.119 --> 19:15.643
I'll try to remember that.

19:16.855 --> 19:20.347
Honey, please don't ask me to apologize

19:20.425 --> 19:22.916
for wanting to keep you my little girl.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.693
- Hey, you wanna dance?
- Yeah.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.199
Not with you.

19:42.447 --> 19:44.745
- You wanna dance?
- No.

19:47.052 --> 19:49.111
Hey, what's that over there?

19:49.188 --> 19:51.349
- Bridget and Travis broke up.
- What?

19:51.456 --> 19:53.617
Yeah. She didn't like him that much.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.853
She loved the free ride
you were giving her.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.861
Where is Bridget?
I wanna talk to her.

19:57.930 --> 20:01.161
She was a little upset,
so I let her go home with...

20:01.233 --> 20:02.461
Kyle!

20:03.235 --> 20:06.102
Last night, I had a dream
that we were both in your truck,

20:06.171 --> 20:09.732
but I couldn't see you because
I was wearing my Kate Spade sunglasses,

20:09.808 --> 20:13.244
which makes it hard for me to see
because the tint is too dark.

20:13.312 --> 20:16.281
- I had the same dream.
- Oh, my God!

20:17.416 --> 20:19.748
Daddy, didn't we talk about knocking?

20:23.555 --> 20:25.523
Who said you could be alone
with a boy?

20:25.624 --> 20:27.114
She did.

20:28.460 --> 20:33.397
Hi, Kyle. Paul, you locked Kerry
and me in the car again.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.000
- Kyle, why don't you G to G?
- What?

20:36.101 --> 20:37.261
- Leave!
- Dad!

20:38.737 --> 20:42.264
- I'll see you in your dreams.
- Hey, you stay out of her dreams.

20:44.009 --> 20:49.311
You know what, no boys allowed
after 11:30, and it is exactly...

20:50.082 --> 20:51.913
...11:30.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.544
You are so mean!
You owe me an apology.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.714
No, I don't.

20:59.791 --> 21:02.055
Not my hair.
God, I spent all day on my hair.

21:02.127 --> 21:04.789
Now it's gonna smell like my father.
