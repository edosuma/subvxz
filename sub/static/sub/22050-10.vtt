00:02.509 --> 00:06.909
I've decided that my life is better
without mentally ill people around me.

00:07.696 --> 00:12.396
Then I'll ask you: What happens
after I've rescued you?

00:12.600 --> 00:13.600
He's manic!

00:14.520 --> 00:15.820
That's what's happening!

00:16.317 --> 00:19.317
So can you please  just stay away?

00:20.307 --> 00:23.307
What about asking Even how he feels?

00:23.346 --> 00:27.446
He isn't brain dead just because
he had a maniac episode.

00:30.005 --> 00:32.738
Just talk to him when he has calmed down.

01:49.794 --> 02:01.294
Hi Sonja. I just wanted to tell you that
Even is with me if his parents are worried.

02:01.844 --> 02:15.344
And I am sorry if it's because
of me that he is not doing well.

02:18.631 --> 02:23.031
SATURDAY 10:15

02:35.899 --> 02:37.599
Hi!

02:37.949 --> 02:38.949
Hi!

02:40.176 --> 02:41.876
I don't have...

02:42.758 --> 02:45.558
The telephone number of his parents so...

02:45.687 --> 02:46.487
Yeah.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.500
But they know that he is with you.

02:48.505 --> 02:50.505
He has sent them a text.

02:51.289 --> 02:52.289
Okay.

02:56.449 --> 02:58.382
I just called to say

02:58.499 --> 03:00.766
that I am sorry for the last time.

03:04.333 --> 03:05.733
It's okay.

03:07.226 --> 03:10.626
No, but I didn't mean
to get angry with you.

03:11.131 --> 03:13.031
It wasn't your fault.

03:13.108 --> 03:14.108
At all.

03:15.354 --> 03:16.654
Yeah, but...

03:17.419 --> 03:18.919
Well you...

03:19.279 --> 03:22.346
You were worried. So I understand.

03:23.322 --> 03:24.322
Hmm.

03:25.457 --> 03:29.857
And it's not your fault
that Even is depressed.

03:30.142 --> 03:32.375
He is bipolar and...

03:34.048 --> 03:35.748
Well, it's not your fault.

03:36.706 --> 03:37.906
Okay?

03:38.420 --> 03:39.620
Yeah.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.554
Okay.

03:42.915 --> 03:43.915
Good.

03:44.121 --> 03:45.621
But...

03:46.709 --> 03:50.009
Should I get him to his
parents or something?

03:52.679 --> 03:56.312
I actually think it's good
for him to be with you.

04:01.698 --> 04:02.698
Okay.

04:04.450 --> 04:06.850
I don't know. Is there anything I can do?

04:06.869 --> 04:08.269
For him?

04:09.657 --> 04:10.957
No, not really.

04:12.155 --> 04:13.422
You just need to...

04:14.299 --> 04:16.032
Be there for him.

04:19.008 --> 04:21.941
And when everything seems
hopeless, you just

04:22.926 --> 04:24.659
Take one day at a time.

04:26.748 --> 04:30.181
And if one day becomes too much,
then just take one hour at a time.

04:31.979 --> 04:35.979
And if one hour becomes too much,
then just take one minute at a time.

04:49.109 --> 04:50.109
Hi.

04:51.003 --> 04:52.003
Hi.

05:06.153 --> 05:07.453
Hungry?

05:11.509 --> 05:12.976
What time is it?

05:14.355 --> 05:15.355
Around...

05:15.566 --> 05:17.166
Ten thirty or something.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.800
I should leave.

05:22.172 --> 05:23.272
Why?

05:27.305 --> 05:30.505
Because I don't want you to lie here and
feel like you have to take care of me.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.140
I don't feel like I am looking after you.

05:37.452 --> 05:38.452
And why?

05:38.914 --> 05:40.414
Why is that wrong?

05:44.162 --> 05:46.462
There's nothing wrong with it.

05:47.213 --> 05:50.213
I just can't stand that
you lie here all sad.

05:53.418 --> 05:55.118
I am not sad.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.807
I just know that this
isn't going to work out.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.130
Why do you say that?

06:23.592 --> 06:25.092
Because it's true.

06:31.219 --> 06:32.952
I'm just going...

06:33.736 --> 06:34.936
to hurt you.

06:36.110 --> 06:38.010
And then you'll hate me.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.660
No.

06:52.687 --> 06:56.987
You don't know shit about
how this is going to end.

06:58.719 --> 07:02.386
We might get a nuclear bomb dropped
on our heads tomorrow and...

07:02.416 --> 07:05.916
and then discusing this is
just a waste of time, so

07:06.016 --> 07:09.216
I suggest that you just stop
talking about the future.

07:09.230 --> 07:12.830
And then the two of us will just
take this thing completely chill.

07:19.701 --> 07:21.201
Let's play a game.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.543
It goes like this...

07:25.449 --> 07:26.882
It's called

07:26.990 --> 07:30.690
Isak and Even: Minute a minute.

07:40.110 --> 07:42.210
It's about...

07:42.778 --> 07:45.245
The only thing we have to worry about

07:46.384 --> 07:48.651
is the next minute.

07:55.718 --> 07:57.918
Are you up for it?

07:57.982 --> 07:59.182
Okay.

08:07.305 --> 08:09.638
What should we do this minute then?

08:09.699 --> 08:11.232
This minute we'll kiss.

08:15.919 --> 08:17.119
That's chill.

08:17.217 --> 08:18.217
That's chill.

08:42.533 --> 08:45.133
MONDAY 10:36

08:45.839 --> 08:49.339
But Eskild, if he is asleep
just let him sleep, you know?

08:49.898 --> 08:53.265
Shouldn't I wake him up and
ask him how he is doing?

08:53.358 --> 08:55.258
No. Why would you do that?

08:55.326 --> 08:58.526
I don't know. It was you who
said to take care of him.

08:59.122 --> 09:02.822
Yeah, I asked you to keep an eye
on him because he is depressed,

09:02.830 --> 09:06.830
not to look after him as he was a baby.
Just let him sleep.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.861
Okay. I think he just woke up.

09:08.919 --> 09:10.919
Yeah, okay. Talk to you later.

09:11.170 --> 09:12.370
Hi, Isak!

09:12.588 --> 09:13.788
Hi, Vilde!

09:13.914 --> 09:17.147
Have you seen the message I
posted on the kose group?

09:18.683 --> 09:19.683
Kose group?

09:19.885 --> 09:21.618
No, no. I haven't seen it.

09:23.004 --> 09:24.504
Why are you laughing?

09:25.431 --> 09:27.031
Nothing, I just...

09:27.184 --> 09:30.784
Had almost forgotten that the
kose group even existed.

09:31.441 --> 09:33.041
Are you still in it?

09:33.180 --> 09:34.880
This is when the revue starts.

09:34.885 --> 09:38.418
You can't just be part of the
partying and not do any work.

09:39.481 --> 09:41.981
No, of couse I'm still in
the kose group, Vilde.

09:42.024 --> 09:43.224
Who do you think I am?

09:44.183 --> 09:47.216
Okay, because all the groups have
this Christmas get-together.

09:47.226 --> 09:50.026
And it went so well the last time we
had the pre-game at your place.

09:50.033 --> 09:52.366
That I was wondering if we
could have it at yours?

09:54.059 --> 09:55.059
Yeah!

09:55.593 --> 09:56.793
Yeah?

09:56.839 --> 09:58.772
Is it okay with your roomies?

09:58.819 --> 10:00.919
I am sure it is. Jesus Christ, yeah!

10:00.920 --> 10:02.920
Okay. I'll send out the invites then!

10:02.989 --> 10:03.989
Go ahead!

10:25.781 --> 10:26.781
Hello.

10:27.583 --> 10:28.583
Hi.

10:30.278 --> 10:32.978
There's this asshole in second year.

10:33.253 --> 10:37.153
Who will be hosting this Christmas
get-together with the kose group.

10:37.295 --> 10:38.695
On Friday?

10:39.095 --> 10:42.595
So, he was wondering
if you wanted to come?

10:42.598 --> 10:45.531
Because he thinks that
would be really nice.

10:47.003 --> 10:52.536
I have switched to the PR-Group. So...

10:53.995 --> 10:55.395
But...

10:55.617 --> 10:56.917
You...

10:57.217 --> 11:04.250
Should tell the asshole that
I am very glad he asked.

11:04.252 --> 11:07.652
I'll tell the asshole, yeah.
He'll appreciate that.

11:07.836 --> 11:09.036
Do that.

11:09.719 --> 11:10.719
Yes. Bye.

11:10.819 --> 11:11.819
Bye.

11:17.132 --> 11:19.498
WEDNESDAY. 16:01

11:21.666 --> 11:22.666
Linn, that way.

11:22.866 --> 11:23.866
I was going to kick!

11:24.737 --> 11:25.737
No, no, no.

11:25.772 --> 11:26.772
Back to him?

11:26.868 --> 11:27.668
Yeah!

11:27.672 --> 11:28.722
Do you want him to score?

11:29.005 --> 11:30.005
No! No, no, no, no!

11:30.294 --> 11:32.427
Come on!!! Fucking spanish fucker!!!

11:35.047 --> 11:36.047
Hello.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.446
Hello.

11:38.046 --> 11:41.113
Nice, you are at home. I
am fucking exhausted!

11:41.769 --> 11:43.069
Sore loser?

11:44.229 --> 11:45.496
I'm going to sleep!

11:46.994 --> 11:49.127
Cool hanging out with you, Linn!

11:52.973 --> 11:53.873
Hello.

11:53.892 --> 11:54.792
Hello.

12:03.003 --> 12:04.270
Everything okay?

12:08.327 --> 12:12.194
Did you ask all of your
roomies to look after me?

12:12.871 --> 12:14.771
Hm? No.

12:18.019 --> 12:20.352
Holy fuck! You are such a bad liar!

12:20.458 --> 12:22.091
Uh? Am I a bad liar?

12:22.298 --> 12:23.298
Yeah!

12:23.424 --> 12:24.491
I am a bad liar?

12:24.512 --> 12:27.712
I am the fucking master liar. There's
no a better liar than me!

12:27.759 --> 12:30.326
I mean, you have no idea what
I've gotten away with.

12:30.328 --> 12:32.628
Tell me! What have you gotten away with?

12:32.950 --> 12:35.483
No, I mean, you don't want to know.

12:43.123 --> 12:44.723
I like seeing you laugh.

12:49.617 --> 12:50.884
Holy fuck, Vilde...

12:51.480 --> 12:54.547
Nagging me so fucking much
about that kose group stuff.

12:54.564 --> 12:55.697
The kose group?!?

12:56.950 --> 12:59.150
I had completely forgotten about it!

12:59.260 --> 13:02.727
Yeah. Don't tell her that
because she'll get pissed.

13:02.729 --> 13:07.029
She was terrified people just joined
for the revue parties or something.

13:07.190 --> 13:09.490
Well, I was there to meet you.

13:10.733 --> 13:11.733
Seriously?!

13:12.400 --> 13:15.333
Yeah. Did you think I
was there to have fun?

13:20.768 --> 13:24.601
Had you seen me before
that first kose meeting?

13:26.390 --> 13:27.390
Yeah.

13:27.883 --> 13:30.150
I saw you the first day of school.

13:32.626 --> 13:33.626
Wow!

13:39.616 --> 13:40.816
Fuck!

13:41.415 --> 13:42.415
Hi, Vilde!

13:44.674 --> 13:47.441
No, we don't have a Christmas tree here.

13:49.941 --> 13:50.941
No.

13:52.965 --> 13:53.965
Yeah, but...

13:54.065 --> 13:58.665
If you are so fucking keen on a Christmas
tree you'll have to buy one yourself.

14:01.983 --> 14:04.883
Well, you can buy a Christmas
tree anywhere, Vilde!

14:04.884 --> 14:07.184
In Kiellands plass! There's...

14:07.282 --> 14:08.915
Yeah. Okay, cool.

14:09.731 --> 14:10.931
Bye!

14:13.451 --> 14:14.451
Christmas tree?

14:16.181 --> 14:17.181
Yeah!

14:17.195 --> 14:18.595
I haven't told you...

14:18.597 --> 14:22.397
Speaking of the Kose group. I'll be hosting
a Christmas get-together here on Friday.

14:22.398 --> 14:23.398
Here?

14:24.919 --> 14:25.919
Friday?

14:26.736 --> 14:28.136
Do you wanna come?

14:40.391 --> 14:43.191
I have actually promised my mom that...

14:43.598 --> 14:45.865
I talked to her today.

14:46.484 --> 14:49.617
And she really wanted
me to stop by at home.

14:51.622 --> 14:52.922
To eat and stuff.

14:53.603 --> 14:58.136
I don't know. I was thinking maybe
I'll just stay there for a while.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.500
Just take it one day at a time.

15:29.875 --> 15:32.175
THURSDAY. 13:55

15:32.504 --> 15:33.504
Hey, boys!

15:33.508 --> 15:34.508
Hey, Isak.

15:34.942 --> 15:35.742
What's up?

15:35.779 --> 15:36.846
All good! All good!

15:37.490 --> 15:38.390
Peace!

15:38.417 --> 15:40.017
How is it going with Evak?

15:40.471 --> 15:44.238
Good, I guess. We are taking it
day by day, minute by minute.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.400
Minute by minute. Oh holy shit! Listen!

15:46.405 --> 15:48.005
Even and Isak, minute by minute.

15:48.007 --> 15:50.507
That's the kind of shit
you can sell to NRK.

15:50.508 --> 15:52.675
People would dig it, man!
I'd watch it myself!

15:52.713 --> 15:54.513
That's kind of fucked up to think about.

15:54.528 --> 15:56.095
Why? If you like, banged on TV.

15:56.105 --> 15:58.905
You don't think I can handle
watching to guys bang?

15:58.908 --> 16:01.608
No, it's more me it's fucked up for.
That you'd be watching us bang.

16:01.664 --> 16:03.664
Because that would be a real turn off.

16:03.668 --> 16:05.068
You think I am a turn off?

16:05.554 --> 16:07.854
You are definitely not a turn on.

16:07.930 --> 16:11.730
Bullshit! You'd so bang me if
you had the chance. I know!

16:11.781 --> 16:12.781
No!

16:13.869 --> 16:16.969
Okay, bullshit. Who would you bang first?
Out of all of us?

16:16.978 --> 16:17.978
Mahdi, Jonas or me?

16:18.353 --> 16:19.353
Jonas!

16:19.466 --> 16:21.399
Right! That's what I thought!

16:21.721 --> 16:23.521
Okay, between me and Mahdi, then?

16:23.558 --> 16:24.558
Oh! That would be you...

16:24.569 --> 16:25.569
Mahdi!

16:25.623 --> 16:26.890
Second place, bro!!

16:26.932 --> 16:29.532
What the fuck? Why doesn't
anyone want to bang me?

16:29.543 --> 16:31.876
You are just desperate.
It's just how it is!

16:31.959 --> 16:33.392
I'm not desperate. I'm super chill.

16:33.788 --> 16:37.321
Oh shit, bro! There
are the dance chicks!

17:11.428 --> 17:14.428
Hi! You are Isak, right?

17:15.502 --> 17:16.502
Yeah!

17:17.946 --> 17:21.546
We just heard that you have a
thing with Even in third year.

17:21.591 --> 17:23.891
And so we just wanted
to say that we dig it.

17:23.972 --> 17:26.839
It's insanely cute two
guys being together.

17:29.264 --> 17:30.264
Not big deal.

17:31.865 --> 17:34.565
And the dance-group will have a
Christmas meeting this Friday.

17:34.682 --> 17:36.615
You can join, if you want to.

17:37.614 --> 17:42.947
I don't think I can because I am going to
the kose group Christmas get-together.

17:47.745 --> 17:51.045
- That's too bad.
- We'll see you around.

17:53.543 --> 17:54.543
Bye.

17:58.004 --> 17:59.504
- What the fuck?
- Bro?!?

18:00.531 --> 18:01.731
What?

18:01.846 --> 18:04.713
Christmas get-together
with the kose group?

18:05.226 --> 18:08.526
Yeah. I'll be there, you
are welcome to join, guys.

18:08.535 --> 18:11.135
And like I'm hosting, you are
more than welcome to come!

18:12.027 --> 18:14.360
The gate to paradise was wide open

18:14.366 --> 18:17.266
and you are talking about a
get-together with the kose group. Man?

18:23.988 --> 18:27.321
Guys, you need to start
getting chicks yourselves.

18:31.943 --> 18:34.143
Fucking hell! The world is so unfair!

18:34.373 --> 18:35.673
Fucking hell!

18:36.573 --> 18:37.873
What did he say?

18:38.973 --> 18:40.773
Should we ditch him and
go to the other one?

18:41.116 --> 18:44.216
@Ledgerina

19:35.299 --> 19:38.199
- Now it is straight.
- No, it is loopsided.

19:39.583 --> 19:42.583
- Now it is loopsided.
- No, it is straight.

19:42.666 --> 19:45.766
- Oh, now it is loopsided.
- No, it's straight.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.412
- Yeah.
- Maybe you are loopsided, Linn?

19:51.232 --> 19:52.532
- No.
- Yes.

19:52.814 --> 19:54.914
- I did it!
- I can help you.

19:55.732 --> 19:56.732
Where's that from?

19:56.961 --> 19:57.961
Drummer boy!

19:58.440 --> 19:59.640
Justin Bieber.

20:00.122 --> 20:01.655
What? He sang that one?

20:01.864 --> 20:04.264
Yeah! He is the one who sings it!

20:04.269 --> 20:06.936
Did the exams go all right for you guys?

20:07.224 --> 20:10.224
No. I got a message that I am
failing German and English.

20:11.417 --> 20:14.050
I didn't know there was
a 10% absence limit!

20:14.098 --> 20:16.131
How could you not known about that?

20:16.190 --> 20:18.790
I have told you the entire school year!

20:19.177 --> 20:21.577
Yeah, but I thought
you said that because

20:21.579 --> 20:24.279
you were jealous that I was
hanging out with Kasper a lot.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.759
Why would I be jealous?

20:27.108 --> 20:29.008
Because you are not getting
any dick yourself!

20:31.472 --> 20:33.072
I get plenty of dick!

20:40.503 --> 20:41.703
Chris...

20:43.824 --> 20:45.691
Well, she can have this one.

20:45.692 --> 20:46.692
And this one!

20:47.418 --> 20:48.785
That one is beautiful!

20:49.102 --> 20:50.869
It might be more fitting.

20:52.016 --> 20:53.016
Is it used?

20:54.171 --> 20:55.371
Is it from Eskild?

20:56.567 --> 20:57.767
Is it from Eskild?

20:59.349 --> 21:00.349
Where is it from, Noora?

21:00.994 --> 21:01.994
Oh! Holy fuck!

21:02.489 --> 21:03.622
Where is it from?

21:03.655 --> 21:05.555
Take it away! Take it
away from the table!

21:05.558 --> 21:06.858
I don't know! I don't know!

21:06.899 --> 21:08.399
- Oh my God!
- Smell it then!

21:08.400 --> 21:09.600
No? Smell it?!?

21:09.747 --> 21:10.980
God! What is your problem?

21:10.992 --> 21:13.092
Smell it to see if it smells like dick!

21:13.409 --> 21:15.342
You smell it then! Oh my God!

21:15.838 --> 21:17.871
But Eskild is your friend.

21:18.316 --> 21:19.883
Yeah! That's pretty obvious!

21:19.927 --> 21:20.927
You can do it!

21:21.083 --> 21:22.083
Hey!

21:22.088 --> 21:24.955
- Is it a fight?
- You are on, you are on.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.951
Exactly! Now you've got the attitude.

21:27.543 --> 21:29.543
You are not going to hit Vilde that hard

21:29.547 --> 21:30.747
or anything like that but...

21:30.750 --> 21:31.950
What should I do then?

21:31.962 --> 21:34.962
You are a predator and she is your prey.
Do you get what I mean?

21:35.015 --> 21:36.215
She is what?

21:36.415 --> 21:39.115
She is your prey. You are a predator.
You are a lion and she is...

21:39.124 --> 21:40.391
Oohhhh! Okay! Okay!

21:40.865 --> 21:41.765
Yeah? You know?

21:41.865 --> 21:45.065
But you can't make a big deal of it
because then the prey will flee.

21:45.527 --> 21:47.594
Seriously, I am really nervous.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.821
You shouldn't be... Are
you in love or what?

21:49.851 --> 21:50.984
I don't know. Maybe.

21:50.988 --> 21:51.988
- Oh.
- No!!

21:51.990 --> 21:53.190
Yes, I think so.

21:54.192 --> 21:56.259
What if she doesn't say yes?

21:56.421 --> 21:58.654
- That's life.
- What is the hint, then?

21:58.670 --> 22:00.803
It's not the end of the
world if it doesn't work.

22:00.806 --> 22:03.306
Just think that it is a positive
thing if it works so...

22:03.429 --> 22:06.129
It's fucking awkward if I
stand there and she says no.

22:06.349 --> 22:09.782
Yeah, but you don't ask her right
away: "Hey, should we hook up?"

22:09.784 --> 22:12.384
- Straighten back, smile a little.
- Should I touch her?

22:12.395 --> 22:13.400
If it's appropiate.

22:13.402 --> 22:14.602
Do I look good?

22:14.620 --> 22:15.620
Yeah! Nice!

22:15.658 --> 22:17.691
It's a little pumped. I see it.

22:17.698 --> 22:19.698
This sweater... I bought
it a size too big.

22:19.781 --> 22:21.978
I have to drink more. Where is the beer?

22:22.030 --> 22:23.530
- Hello.
- Hey.

22:24.427 --> 22:25.427
Be cool, you know?

22:25.773 --> 22:26.773
What's up?

22:27.030 --> 22:30.330
We are helping Magnus to bang Vilde.

22:31.224 --> 22:32.224
Wow!

22:32.290 --> 22:33.557
How is it going?

22:34.024 --> 22:37.291
He shouldn't be so desperate.
Then I think he's got it!

22:37.300 --> 22:40.567
It's fucking impossible
not to be desperate

22:40.569 --> 22:42.969
when I don't get what it
means to be desperate!

22:43.120 --> 22:46.853
Just imagine... Who do you think
of as a really cool, laid-back guy?

22:46.859 --> 22:48.059
Pretend to be like him.

22:48.060 --> 22:48.960
Try to be that person.

22:48.961 --> 22:50.628
- James Bond, then?
- Yeah, sure.

22:50.719 --> 22:51.719
You know what, Magnus?

22:51.828 --> 22:54.828
I think you should go
all in and be yourself.

22:54.930 --> 22:56.930
Take desperate to a whole new level.

22:57.948 --> 22:58.948
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:59.364 --> 23:00.697
He's into something.

23:02.759 --> 23:03.759
What do you mean?

23:03.972 --> 23:05.972
Show her how desperate
you really are, then!

23:06.826 --> 23:07.826
Let it all out!

23:09.841 --> 23:11.441
Take desperate to a new level.

23:11.451 --> 23:12.651
Fuck! I am going to do it!

23:12.652 --> 23:13.652
Bye. Talk to you later.

23:13.943 --> 23:15.076
I gotta see this.

23:18.811 --> 23:20.811
- Hello.
- Hello.

23:21.379 --> 23:22.446
How is it going?

23:22.831 --> 23:23.831
I'm fine.

23:24.848 --> 23:27.781
I have just talked to my mum.

23:27.957 --> 23:29.557
And...

23:29.772 --> 23:32.705
The reason she is anoyed is because
she really wants to meet you.

23:33.519 --> 23:34.519
Okay.

23:36.302 --> 23:37.302
So...

23:38.186 --> 23:40.486
What do you say if we drop by tomorrow?

23:41.951 --> 23:42.551
Yeah.

23:42.662 --> 23:43.262
Yeah?

23:43.269 --> 23:44.169
Yeah. Yeah.

23:44.585 --> 23:46.985
You don't think this is weird?

23:47.653 --> 23:49.920
No. I don't find anything weird anymore.

23:49.924 --> 23:50.724
Okay.

23:54.112 --> 23:55.845
As long as you are smiling and...

23:55.849 --> 23:56.849
I can do that.

23:56.850 --> 23:57.850
Wearing clothes, then...

24:00.247 --> 24:01.514
Then life is chill.

24:04.799 --> 24:07.132
I promise that I will wear clothes.

24:13.859 --> 24:14.859
Hello.

24:14.934 --> 24:15.934
Sana!

24:15.986 --> 24:16.606
Hi.

24:16.683 --> 24:18.183
- You have met each other, right?
- The Kose group.

24:18.638 --> 24:19.438
Yeah.

24:19.605 --> 24:20.872
My biology partner.

24:20.988 --> 24:21.988
And friend.

24:22.288 --> 24:25.421
Yeah, how is Isak really
doing in biology?

24:27.071 --> 24:28.071
He is useful.

24:28.183 --> 24:28.783
Huh?!?

24:28.806 --> 24:29.806
I guess...

24:29.820 --> 24:31.620
Sana, that's such bullshit!

24:31.697 --> 24:35.797
I helped you towards a fucking 5 while
I have been on that 6 the whole year!

24:35.894 --> 24:37.394
I have a Christmas present for you.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.400
For me?!?

24:40.114 --> 24:41.314
What is it?

24:41.459 --> 24:42.459
Open it!

24:43.163 --> 24:44.563
Okay. I will open it.

24:51.848 --> 24:53.148
10%!

24:53.153 --> 24:54.153
Thank you!

24:54.157 --> 24:55.657
What a cool biology partner!

24:56.464 --> 24:58.664
It wasn't of any use for you after all?

24:58.742 --> 25:00.842
I used it right now, didn't I?

25:01.377 --> 25:02.377
True!

25:07.964 --> 25:09.364
You are not getting any of this!

25:11.010 --> 25:12.188
It's not good for you.

25:15.637 --> 25:17.587
Then it's not good for you either!

25:17.780 --> 25:20.880
It's completely fine for
me, but not for you.

25:21.002 --> 25:23.902
Are you going to be the one who
tells me if it is good or not?

25:23.944 --> 25:24.854
Of course I am!

25:24.855 --> 25:25.855
That's my job!

25:26.100 --> 25:28.900
- You've got a job?
- Yeah, it's literally my job.

25:28.913 --> 25:30.946
That's why I am doing all this, you know?

25:31.169 --> 25:34.336
I found this poster on Løkka that said

25:34.562 --> 25:37.962
"Even Bech Næsheim needs a
support person and boyfriend".

25:38.988 --> 25:40.288
And then you applied?

25:40.333 --> 25:40.733
Yeah.

25:40.734 --> 25:42.734
I thought, "Holy fuck, he is so hot!"

25:46.800 --> 25:47.900
That was nice.

25:47.917 --> 25:48.617
Yeah.

25:48.660 --> 25:49.627
You are so nice.

25:49.654 --> 25:50.954
I could have done it for free

25:51.055 --> 25:52.355
but it's nice I'm getting...

25:52.390 --> 25:53.490
Are you getting paid?!?

25:53.500 --> 25:55.867
Yeah, your mom pays me 500 a week.

25:56.220 --> 25:57.220
What?

25:57.223 --> 25:57.723
Yeah!

25:57.728 --> 25:59.228
- No wonder...
- Are you kidding me?

25:59.238 --> 26:01.238
There's no wonder why
she wants to meet me.

26:01.576 --> 26:02.376
Holy fuck!!!

26:02.383 --> 26:04.050
I'm getting some of that money.

26:04.078 --> 26:05.078
- No.
- Yes.

26:05.118 --> 26:07.718
It's my money! You are not getting any.

26:15.968 --> 26:17.601
- Yes! Come one!
- No.

26:26.925 --> 26:28.225
Hello.

26:28.758 --> 26:29.758
Hi.

26:38.246 --> 26:39.579
Do you like cats?

26:42.820 --> 26:44.020
Yeah, a lot.

26:46.664 --> 26:47.864
I do too.

26:55.228 --> 26:56.228
Meow.

26:58.863 --> 26:59.863
What was that?

27:01.445 --> 27:02.445
Nothing.

27:04.797 --> 27:05.997
Yes, do it again.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.095
Meow.

27:18.119 --> 27:21.019
I have never had sex before and
I really want to have sex.

27:27.154 --> 27:28.654
You are welcome to fuck me.

27:33.533 --> 27:34.533
Thanks.

27:48.277 --> 27:49.277
Hi!

27:49.304 --> 27:50.304
Hello there!

27:50.307 --> 27:51.907
- May I sit down?
- Yeah, absolutely.

27:52.886 --> 27:54.853
I'm sitting here with my angel.

27:54.919 --> 27:55.519
Yeah.

27:55.725 --> 27:58.092
- Does it look nice?
- Very nice.

27:58.788 --> 28:00.288
How are you doing?

28:01.567 --> 28:02.700
It's been a long time
since last time we spoke.

28:02.701 --> 28:05.334
Yeah! It's been a fucking long
time since we last spoke.

28:05.344 --> 28:07.644
It's a little weird. I 've
been thinking about it. We...

28:07.645 --> 28:10.145
We used to hang out all the
time, but now it's like...

28:10.150 --> 28:11.650
We only see each other at school.

28:11.651 --> 28:12.251
Yeah.

28:12.260 --> 28:13.760
And then it's just "hi" and...

28:13.782 --> 28:14.782
We should hang out more.

28:15.210 --> 28:16.810
- Absolutely.
- We should.

28:16.811 --> 28:19.344
We really should do something because...

28:19.356 --> 28:21.489
I honestly miss the time when we...

28:22.022 --> 28:23.522
When we used to hang out more.

28:23.614 --> 28:24.914
First upper school
secondary school and...

28:24.923 --> 28:25.223
Yeah.

28:25.374 --> 28:27.307
The summer vacation before...

28:28.026 --> 28:29.326
Before Nissen when it just...

28:29.729 --> 28:31.729
was a lot of drama and
all that stuff, but...

28:31.914 --> 28:34.414
But, hey! You've gotten a boyfriend!

28:34.900 --> 28:36.400
Yes. I have.

28:38.018 --> 28:39.618
He is really handsome.

28:41.902 --> 28:42.902
He is.

28:43.634 --> 28:44.334
You, lucky pig!

28:44.429 --> 28:45.729
You better watch out for me!

28:46.547 --> 28:47.647
I might steal him.

28:52.965 --> 28:53.998
I have...

28:55.221 --> 28:57.621
I have been thinking about something.

28:57.946 --> 28:58.946
What's that?

28:59.544 --> 29:00.544
Nah, just...

29:05.716 --> 29:08.516
I actually wanted to say sorry
for that stuff last year.

29:08.542 --> 29:09.742
When I was...

29:10.879 --> 29:12.842
When I was ruining it for you
and Jonas and all that stuff.

29:12.890 --> 29:13.690
It's not okay.

29:14.214 --> 29:15.196
What I did.

29:15.297 --> 29:16.297
I've been thinking about that.

29:17.069 --> 29:19.736
You didn't fuck it up
between Jonas and me.

29:19.866 --> 29:22.399
It was Jonas and I who
fucked it up between us.

29:24.681 --> 29:25.748
Might be, but...

29:25.752 --> 29:27.685
I still feel like I tricked you.

29:27.690 --> 29:28.690
And..

29:29.956 --> 29:33.456
When I told you that I had feelings
for you. That wasn't truth.

29:34.893 --> 29:36.893
Hey, I figured that out.

29:36.912 --> 29:38.012
- Yeah?
- Yes.

29:39.956 --> 29:41.156
I'm over it.

29:42.231 --> 29:43.798
And you should be too.

29:43.879 --> 29:44.979
Seriously.

29:46.404 --> 29:48.704
Can't we talk about
your boyfriend instead?

29:49.565 --> 29:51.632
Is he "the man of your life"?

29:52.581 --> 29:53.581
I don't know that.

29:55.126 --> 29:56.126
No?

29:58.062 --> 29:59.129
Is it important?

29:59.558 --> 30:00.458
No...

30:01.912 --> 30:03.012
But...

30:03.550 --> 30:05.217
Is it okay between the two of you?

30:05.525 --> 30:06.225
Yeah, yeah!

30:06.278 --> 30:08.678
I mean, right now it's amazing

30:08.724 --> 30:11.824
but a week ago it was very bad so

30:11.937 --> 30:13.570
it's a bit up and down.

30:14.805 --> 30:16.105
Stressful.

30:16.644 --> 30:17.644
Yeah, or...

30:19.121 --> 30:20.221
Anyway.

30:20.269 --> 30:24.269
The fact that it is so good when it's
good it's also kind of the reason of

30:24.270 --> 30:27.670
why it is so bad when it's bad.
Does that make any sense?

30:28.625 --> 30:29.625
And...

30:30.165 --> 30:32.265
It can all suddenly
be over tomorrow but

30:33.182 --> 30:35.982
I'm still insanely happy
that I have met him.

30:39.215 --> 30:40.315
Because...

30:40.338 --> 30:43.938
That's when you were certain
that you like boys?

30:44.955 --> 30:45.755
Yeah.

30:46.182 --> 30:47.182
I mean, no.

30:47.403 --> 30:48.770
More because...

30:49.268 --> 30:51.268
I was fake before.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.018
I mean...

30:55.399 --> 30:56.399
I...

30:58.282 --> 31:02.482
I was only lying at home watching
Narcos or gaming or stuff.

31:04.138 --> 31:07.405
And I'm over that. Now I
want my life to be real.

31:07.812 --> 31:11.145
Even if that means it will be
absolutely awful at times,

31:11.150 --> 31:13.150
it's still way better than

31:13.153 --> 31:15.620
to be fake and boring for everything.

31:19.158 --> 31:20.258
Well said.

31:21.909 --> 31:23.976
It's a little bit cliché but...

31:24.872 --> 31:27.105
You never know who will die tomorrow.

31:27.107 --> 31:28.107
You know?

31:28.758 --> 31:29.758
And...

31:30.477 --> 31:33.344
Wheter you believe in
Allah, or Jesus or...

31:33.793 --> 31:35.893
The theory of Evolution, or...

31:36.903 --> 31:39.103
Parallel universes.

31:40.670 --> 31:44.770
There's only one thing
we all now for certain.

31:52.707 --> 31:53.707
What's that?

31:58.847 --> 32:00.147
That life is...

32:01.100 --> 32:02.400
NOW.

32:05.208 --> 32:10.508
EVERYTHING IS LOVE.

32:11.141 --> 32:22.141
