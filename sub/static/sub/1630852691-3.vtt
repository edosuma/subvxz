01:35.958 --> 01:38.041
-What would you like?
-Today's special, please.

01:38.125 --> 01:39.083
The special…

01:43.666 --> 01:44.500
Your coffee.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.208
Yes?

01:53.250 --> 01:54.541
Your coffee.

01:54.625 --> 01:55.708
One coffee?

02:25.208 --> 02:26.333
Anything else?

02:30.250 --> 02:31.125
Anything else.

03:12.208 --> 03:13.416
<i>How are you doing?</i>

03:13.500 --> 03:15.541
I'm okay, I guess.

03:17.750 --> 03:20.125
Everything is just a bit much right now.

03:24.708 --> 03:25.708
Yeah.

03:26.750 --> 03:27.875
I get that.

03:37.125 --> 03:40.833
<i>-I don't know what to do.</i>
<i>-I think you should call the police.</i>

03:43.250 --> 03:44.666
<i>Do you think everyone knows?</i>

03:45.666 --> 03:47.250
The press and all that?

03:47.750 --> 03:50.250
<i>I checked my phone this morning.</i>
<i>There was nothing.</i>

03:52.500 --> 03:55.250
Fucking hell,
they're going to ask me so many questions.

04:08.333 --> 04:09.500
I keep seeing him.

04:14.666 --> 04:15.750
Yesterday was fun.

04:17.708 --> 04:18.541
Hi.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.041
Hi.

04:23.166 --> 04:24.375
Did you hear?

04:26.041 --> 04:28.375
-What?
-Anne's mom is pregnant.

04:30.041 --> 04:31.083
Oh, okay.

04:31.166 --> 04:33.708
But Anne's dad is…
You know, when they cut your dick?

04:33.791 --> 04:35.833
-A vasectomy?
-Yes, that one.

04:35.916 --> 04:38.166
-Hey, did you hear?
-No.

04:44.291 --> 04:45.583
Are you okay?

04:47.333 --> 04:49.333
He's supposed to teach my next class.

04:49.833 --> 04:50.666
Hans.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.583
So, what will happen?

04:59.375 --> 05:00.708
It'll be all right.

05:20.875 --> 05:21.875
Good morning.

05:23.583 --> 05:24.833
Quiet, please.

05:25.791 --> 05:27.000
Take your seats, please.

05:27.083 --> 05:28.875
-Thank you.
-Where's Hans?

05:28.958 --> 05:33.708
Hans took a leave of absence,
so you'll enjoy my company instead.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.041
Listen to this.

05:43.125 --> 05:47.500
<i>My sister is sick, so I am on leave</i>
<i>and have turned off my phone.</i>

05:47.583 --> 05:51.541
<i>I'm not checking messages,</i>
<i>but you can email me at…</i>

05:53.666 --> 05:54.916
That makes no sense.

05:55.708 --> 05:56.875
What doesn't?

05:57.875 --> 05:59.125
It's not his voice.

06:00.333 --> 06:02.916
But no one else
would record his voicemail.

06:05.250 --> 06:07.500
His blood wasn't like ours either.

06:09.541 --> 06:10.625
How so?

06:11.916 --> 06:15.208
I don't know.
It was just sort of… transparent.

06:17.208 --> 06:20.666
-With a lot of colors in it.
-Did you take any of it with you?

06:21.416 --> 06:22.500
No.

06:23.625 --> 06:25.166
And you're sure it happened?

06:26.583 --> 06:28.083
Why would I lie about it?

06:32.875 --> 06:34.708
What about the other one you saw?

06:35.333 --> 06:36.750
What other one?

06:39.041 --> 06:40.625
Another person.

06:41.291 --> 06:42.958
Or whatever the hell he was.

06:44.291 --> 06:45.916
How did he look?

06:46.958 --> 06:47.958
I couldn't see him.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.333
Are you saying the man was invisible?

06:51.041 --> 06:52.500
No, he wasn't invisible.

06:52.583 --> 06:56.041
He moved super fast. He…

06:57.208 --> 06:58.166
Yes.

06:58.833 --> 07:00.666
Did you talk to the super fast man?

07:03.666 --> 07:04.916
Just forget it.

07:09.791 --> 07:11.916
-Nice one, boys. Really nice.
-What?

07:12.500 --> 07:13.541
What?

07:18.291 --> 07:20.083
So? What are you thinking?

07:20.166 --> 07:22.708
You're right.
I have to talk to the police about it.

07:25.791 --> 07:27.625
He stabbed himself in the neck.

07:28.750 --> 07:29.750
And the blood…

07:32.666 --> 07:34.625
It wasn't red.

07:34.708 --> 07:38.541
INVISIBLE MAN?
BLOOD NOT RED

07:39.125 --> 07:42.250
We dispatched a unit to the address
15 minutes after your call.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.583
We found nothing. Nothing was broken.

07:44.666 --> 07:47.000
We contacted Hans Madsen by phone.

07:47.708 --> 07:49.541
You didn't speak to Hans.

07:50.375 --> 07:52.750
-How do you know this?
-What about the basement?

07:52.833 --> 07:54.166
The basement?

07:54.833 --> 07:56.333
<i>There's a secret room.</i>

08:14.250 --> 08:15.250
Let's go inside.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.500
Hello?

08:18.958 --> 08:20.416
Is anybody home?

08:20.500 --> 08:21.500
Police!

08:33.166 --> 08:34.291
I don't understand.

08:39.291 --> 08:42.125
There are no signs of struggle
right now, are there?

08:46.166 --> 08:47.541
I was lying right there.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.500
That door wasn't there yesterday.

09:18.541 --> 09:20.000
Is this the secret room?

09:22.166 --> 09:23.166
Yes.

09:25.166 --> 09:28.000
-Didn't you say there was fungus?
-There was yesterday.

09:28.583 --> 09:31.875
-So, who tidied up?
-I don't know, do I? The man.

09:36.750 --> 09:37.916
What's happening?

09:40.333 --> 09:41.333
Fuck.

10:07.250 --> 10:10.416
-Emma, what's wrong?
-Just forget it.

10:11.750 --> 10:12.833
I'm crazy.

10:13.583 --> 10:14.791
None of it happened.

10:15.958 --> 10:17.458
I just imagined it.

10:18.791 --> 10:19.791
Leave me alone.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.750
But you didn't imagine it.

10:23.416 --> 10:25.000
You were there. You saw it.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.500
Nobody can just make
all of that disappear.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.666
Well, somebody did.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.708
We need to figure out who.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.208
Maybe I could talk to Susan.

10:45.666 --> 10:46.500
Why?

10:46.583 --> 10:49.250
-Did she clean it up?
-No, I don't think so.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.833
But I think she might know something.

10:52.791 --> 10:54.291
She knew Hans.

10:56.041 --> 10:57.000
Wait a minute.

10:59.083 --> 11:01.083
Frederik actually gave me this.

11:01.958 --> 11:05.083
He saw them arguing,
and she threw this at him.

11:07.916 --> 11:09.875
I don't know if it's useful.

11:17.708 --> 11:18.708
Thanks.

11:20.291 --> 11:21.583
Should I go with you?

11:23.083 --> 11:25.458
No. I'll do it on my own.

11:42.916 --> 11:43.916
Emma?

11:47.125 --> 11:48.625
Did we have an appointment?

11:55.958 --> 11:57.500
Come. Come on in.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.291
Where did you get that?

12:16.708 --> 12:17.958
Hans gave it to me.

12:20.375 --> 12:21.625
Why are you here?

12:23.166 --> 12:24.666
How well do you know him?

12:26.125 --> 12:27.833
Hans and I…

12:28.791 --> 12:29.791
are grown-ups.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.708
I don't care about the affair.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.208
Who does he know besides you?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.041
I don't have time for this.

12:42.833 --> 12:45.958
-I just want to know--
-I can't tell you anything about Hans.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.833
Hans left me, okay?

12:50.958 --> 12:51.958
Just leave.

12:54.750 --> 12:55.750
Leave.

13:20.291 --> 13:21.250
What are you doing?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.541
Figuring out where
the secret room is at Astraeus.

13:25.291 --> 13:27.833
-Why would they have one?
-They're hiding things.

13:28.833 --> 13:31.333
Emma says they have a 100-year history,

13:31.416 --> 13:35.333
but I can't find any trace of them
before the signal came from space.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.416
Then, suddenly, they were here.

13:38.916 --> 13:40.375
They're probably watching us.

13:41.416 --> 13:44.208
Look. Astraeus is owned by a hedge fund

13:44.291 --> 13:47.208
seemingly involved
in a string of companies,

13:47.291 --> 13:50.166
affiliates, and associates
with one thing in common.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.958
-Do you understand?
-Yes, it's…

13:54.416 --> 13:55.250
Not really.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.333
Their registered office is in an area

13:57.416 --> 14:02.041
with either UFO sightings
or rumors of extraterrestrial life.

14:02.750 --> 14:03.833
I see.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.833
And now they're here. In Middelbo.

14:08.375 --> 14:09.208
What do they want?

14:12.041 --> 14:14.625
I told you a million times.
Didn't you hear me?

14:18.125 --> 14:20.291
What do all powerful people want?

14:23.041 --> 14:24.500
Power. More power.

14:24.583 --> 14:28.833
What's more powerful than technology
that humanity could never dream of?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.583
That's a trick question.

14:33.666 --> 14:34.750
-No.
-No?

14:34.833 --> 14:38.125
Astraeus wants
what all multinationals want.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.500
They want to earn more money and dominate.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.750
I don't want that.

14:44.041 --> 14:46.583
I want to expose it all. To everyone.

14:47.541 --> 14:49.500
So, why don't you believe Emma?

14:49.583 --> 14:51.500
-Why don't you look at--
-Hans.

14:52.166 --> 14:53.166
What?

14:54.583 --> 14:58.541
All the stuff about Emma
seeing an alien two seconds after

14:58.625 --> 15:00.125
she became part of all of this.

15:00.208 --> 15:01.541
And then you believe her.

15:01.625 --> 15:03.916
You're the one saying a spaceship crashed.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.333
Shouldn't there be aliens in a spaceship?

15:06.416 --> 15:09.791
I've been working on this forever.
You've been hanging out and chilling.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.750
You didn't believe anything before Emma.

15:11.833 --> 15:15.083
-There was no evidence before.
-Emma doesn't have any either!

15:15.166 --> 15:18.041
I showed you everything.
Indisputable connections.

15:18.125 --> 15:22.166
Materials that don't exist.
Fucking signals from fucking outer space.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.125
But you believe an amateur
who says she met a space man?

15:28.916 --> 15:31.833
I want to believe Emma,
but I need concrete evidence.

15:31.916 --> 15:34.750
Until then,
I'll focus on things I can relate to.

15:34.833 --> 15:38.333
So I need to find out
what Astraeus is hiding. And where.

15:39.958 --> 15:42.083
<i>That's why I'm looking for a secret room.</i>

15:43.708 --> 15:45.416
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Take a look.</i>

15:49.666 --> 15:51.708
My theory is that it's behind…

15:52.416 --> 15:53.416
this one.

15:55.666 --> 15:56.666
<i>Right there?</i>

15:58.208 --> 15:59.833
<i>Yes, right there.</i>

16:06.250 --> 16:09.916
Look at the technical drawings.
A huge part of the shipyard is sealed off.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.500
Okay.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.666
It's the only thing that makes sense.

16:18.125 --> 16:19.833
<i>Much more than</i>
<i>the stuff Emma is making up.</i>

16:28.250 --> 16:30.000
You're sweet when you're jealous.

16:35.625 --> 16:36.625
Hey!

16:40.041 --> 16:41.708
You don't need to clean in there.

16:43.125 --> 16:45.625
I was told to clean everywhere.

16:46.375 --> 16:48.958
I'm the boss telling you not to.

16:49.541 --> 16:50.791
What's in there?

16:50.875 --> 16:52.791
We haven't opened that department yet.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.250
Okay.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.916
It's ridiculous
that you won't even listen to her.

17:06.625 --> 17:07.791
Why?

17:08.291 --> 17:11.333
Because she saw
something completely crazy.

17:11.833 --> 17:14.625
We don't know that. This is my project.

17:14.708 --> 17:16.500
I'm in charge of what we do and when.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.791
Not her.
She's just trying to get attention.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.250
Anything else?○

17:25.125 --> 17:27.583
-Anything else to say about me?
-I'm telling the truth.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.375
You're the ones who got me into this.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.875
When I tell you what's going on,
you don't believe me.

17:34.958 --> 17:36.250
Listen up.

17:36.333 --> 17:39.375
We're trying to prove
that a meteor didn't crash in Middelbo.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.500
We've never mentioned
an alien biology teacher.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.125
That's not what I'm saying.

17:45.208 --> 17:46.291
I'm telling you what I saw.

17:46.375 --> 17:51.750
But maybe you saw something,
and we just don't understand it.

17:51.833 --> 17:54.291
We need something concrete.
Something tangible.

18:01.583 --> 18:02.500
The car.

18:02.583 --> 18:03.791
What?

18:03.875 --> 18:07.750
There was a silver van
outside Hans' house.

18:08.750 --> 18:09.875
I saw it today as well.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.750
Could it be that other guy
Hans was fighting with?

18:12.833 --> 18:14.333
Do you remember the license plate?

18:16.875 --> 18:18.750
A-A-2-2…

18:19.416 --> 18:21.041
4…

18:22.125 --> 18:23.666
I can't remember the rest.

18:24.708 --> 18:25.708
Okay.

18:26.416 --> 18:28.500
But the car has an Avis logo.

18:28.583 --> 18:29.583
Perfect.

18:31.916 --> 18:38.875
Hello. I'm calling
because I rented a silver van from you.

18:39.958 --> 18:43.875
It's embarrassing, but I got drunk
last night and forgot where I parked it.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.875
Yes, exactly.

18:48.875 --> 18:50.750
Great. Thanks for all your help.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.791
134 Bøgevej.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.583
I'll drive out there.

18:56.666 --> 18:58.708
-I'll go with you.
-Okay.

19:07.541 --> 19:09.000
It's got to be here somewhere.

19:12.625 --> 19:13.458
There it is.

19:13.541 --> 19:14.583
-Is that it?
-Yes.

19:22.541 --> 19:25.083
He must be nearby.
Let's see if he checked in.

19:50.833 --> 19:52.041
How much is a room?

19:53.833 --> 19:55.083
It's 400 kroner.

19:55.166 --> 19:56.833
Okay. I'd like to see one, please.

19:57.833 --> 19:59.083
Of course you do.

20:06.458 --> 20:07.583
Just follow me.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.208
-This is so awkward. It's just crazy.
-Exactly.

20:48.291 --> 20:50.541
Just have a look at it.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.916
-It's 1:1. What the hell…
-It's the same.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.791
Who the fuck still has magazine racks?

20:54.875 --> 20:57.583
-There is no--
-It's completely identical.

20:57.666 --> 20:59.458
It's not just similar.

21:00.500 --> 21:01.625
And here.

21:02.125 --> 21:03.041
How crazy is that?

21:03.125 --> 21:06.291
-So, what have you found?
-Nothing.

21:10.208 --> 21:11.208
And you and Emma?

21:12.875 --> 21:13.875
It's nothing.

21:14.833 --> 21:16.208
So, why are you blushing?

21:16.875 --> 21:18.375
The back of my neck is warm.

21:18.458 --> 21:20.041
Did you find anything then?

21:22.250 --> 21:24.791
Just that the decor of someone's house

21:24.875 --> 21:28.541
is identical to the fucking spread
in a 17-year-old catalog.

21:28.625 --> 21:31.791
-What does that mean?
-That he has bad taste.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.375
-Where are you going?
-We'll go to his house again.

21:35.458 --> 21:38.375
-Why?
-No ordinary people live like that.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.875
-I'll come.
-Okay.

21:42.458 --> 21:44.000
So, you don't want the room?

21:45.500 --> 21:46.500
Nope.

21:51.333 --> 21:52.291
Bye.

22:05.666 --> 22:06.916
Look at this.

22:08.625 --> 22:10.416
-Are those the guests?
-Yes.

22:12.666 --> 22:13.875
-It's not one of them.
-No.

22:13.958 --> 22:17.208
He was disguised, so it was hard to see,
but I remember his eyes.

22:17.958 --> 22:19.750
Go back.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.125
Jens Jessen?

22:24.166 --> 22:25.750
-Yes.
-There's no picture.

22:28.875 --> 22:29.916
What do we do now?

22:32.125 --> 22:33.291
We wait.

22:41.250 --> 22:42.541
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

22:44.541 --> 22:47.083
You always say
everybody leaves traces everywhere.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.291
<i>That's right.</i>

22:48.375 --> 22:50.666
<i>So stay sharp and look around.</i>

22:53.875 --> 22:55.208
This is so weird.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.541
<i>What's up?</i>

22:56.625 --> 23:00.916
It's the magazine I took yesterday,
and now it's back again.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.291
<i>Okay. Bring it back with you.</i>
<i>I have to go. See you.</i>

23:04.375 --> 23:05.500
What the hell is that?

23:06.166 --> 23:08.041
Shit!

23:08.916 --> 23:10.000
What's happening?

23:12.125 --> 23:13.458
The toilet doesn't flush.

23:14.916 --> 23:16.458
I couldn't wait.

23:17.583 --> 23:20.083
-Somebody died here.
-We don't know that.

23:22.333 --> 23:24.333
Shit, you're so stupid.

23:45.666 --> 23:47.166
There's nothing here.

23:50.583 --> 23:51.583
No.

23:52.208 --> 23:53.208
Let's go.

23:55.458 --> 23:56.458
Yes.

24:01.541 --> 24:02.541
Wait…

24:04.291 --> 24:06.583
-What is it?
-Look at this.

24:08.125 --> 24:09.458
Is that mold?

24:10.750 --> 24:12.208
It looks like mold.

24:13.208 --> 24:14.416
No, I don't think so.

24:16.458 --> 24:18.250
Emma mentioned fungus.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.291
Don't touch it.

24:23.416 --> 24:26.666
-Find something to scrape it with.
-Yes. That looks weird.

24:41.625 --> 24:42.958
Do you believe it?

24:43.875 --> 24:47.583
All the stuff Mads says
about Astraeus and spaceships?

24:50.458 --> 24:51.458
I believe you.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.250
Seriously?

24:54.500 --> 24:55.708
Fuck.

24:57.166 --> 25:00.666
Does Jonas know
you're sleeping with Frederik?

25:00.750 --> 25:03.166
No, but I know you slept with Jonas.

25:03.833 --> 25:06.916
-That was before you were together.
-No. It really wasn't.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.625
I'm entitled to my opinion.

25:11.666 --> 25:13.291
Jonas and I broke up.

25:13.375 --> 25:16.875
But you have to wait at least a week
before you sleep with someone else.

25:16.958 --> 25:18.916
He made out with Noreen.

25:19.750 --> 25:20.916
I'm just saying!

25:31.125 --> 25:32.958
I thought you were friends.

25:38.875 --> 25:39.916
Fuck it.

25:40.916 --> 25:42.041
Let's get a room.

25:44.333 --> 25:45.333
Okay.

25:50.666 --> 25:51.916
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

25:54.416 --> 25:55.333
Seriously?

26:00.666 --> 26:03.458
She's not the boss of me.
Let's go, Pussy Frederik.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.041
Do you see anything?

26:51.500 --> 26:53.416
It's fluorescent.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.583
And the molecular composition
looks different.

27:01.250 --> 27:02.500
Stop that, please!

27:08.666 --> 27:09.750
What are you doing?

27:10.416 --> 27:12.250
None of your business. What are you doing?

27:12.750 --> 27:14.541
-What do you want?
-Can I borrow your card?

27:14.625 --> 27:17.708
-Fuck off. Come on.
-Sure, but mine's maxed out.

27:17.791 --> 27:21.791
-That's why you can't have mine.
-But why did Dad put a limit on mine?

27:21.875 --> 27:23.083
I don't have time for this.

27:23.166 --> 27:24.458
What's wrong with you?

27:24.541 --> 27:26.916
Don't you understand
the situation we're in?

27:28.666 --> 27:30.750
What don't you understand?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.500
Listen, Noreen.
Don't you understand the situation?

27:36.083 --> 27:37.458
Are you fucking yelling at me?

27:49.875 --> 27:50.875
Hi.

28:01.416 --> 28:02.750
What was that all about?

28:04.791 --> 28:06.666
My sister's just a pain in the ass.

28:09.541 --> 28:10.625
But your…

28:12.166 --> 28:13.166
family…

28:15.291 --> 28:16.500
Are you okay?

28:18.375 --> 28:20.583
My dad's not doing so great.

28:21.583 --> 28:24.000
And Noreen doesn't know anything about it.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.041
He says he can fix it.

28:31.083 --> 28:32.083
How?

28:32.166 --> 28:35.958
Something about the shipyard
attracting more people and creating jobs.

28:38.666 --> 28:40.666
-And you don't think so?
-No.

28:41.208 --> 28:44.125
Why would we profit from
more people at the shipyard?

28:44.208 --> 28:46.208
They don't give a shit about the meteor.

28:47.416 --> 28:48.416
It's old news.

28:49.875 --> 28:50.875
So unless…

28:50.958 --> 28:52.250
The meteor was a spaceship.

28:53.500 --> 28:54.666
Am I being stupid?

28:57.291 --> 28:58.666
You just want to help.

28:59.416 --> 29:01.083
I don't think that's stupid.

29:06.291 --> 29:09.083
What about you? You've been with Emma?

29:11.625 --> 29:12.583
No.

29:13.875 --> 29:16.000
-I can just tell. I knew it!
-No.

29:17.208 --> 29:18.833
What are you talking about?

29:18.916 --> 29:19.916
Wow.

29:21.458 --> 29:25.166
-How was it?
-I don't want to tell you about it.

29:25.833 --> 29:27.250
-Tell me a little.
-No!

29:27.333 --> 29:29.875
-I promise…
-I don't want to tell you!

29:31.125 --> 29:34.208
-But I didn't think Emma was…
-I don't know what Emma is.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.500
The van's still there.

30:20.125 --> 30:21.416
I'm grabbing a shower.

30:22.833 --> 30:23.833
Sure.

30:26.666 --> 30:28.083
Will you keep an eye on it?

30:29.125 --> 30:30.333
I will.

30:38.750 --> 30:40.375
I'll go get something to drink.

30:40.958 --> 30:42.458
Weren't you keeping watch?

30:42.541 --> 30:44.250
Sure, but I'll be right back.

30:45.291 --> 30:46.291
But…

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Hello?

31:37.833 --> 31:40.541
What are you staring at?
Put some clothes on.

31:40.625 --> 31:41.916
It's freezing out here.

31:56.291 --> 31:57.833
Hey, what's happening?

31:58.791 --> 32:00.166
They didn't have cola.

32:01.041 --> 32:02.083
What's up?

32:05.958 --> 32:07.125
Nothing's up.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.125
It wasn't the man from the basement.

32:14.583 --> 32:15.666
Let's get out of here.

32:16.750 --> 32:17.750
Come on.

32:19.375 --> 32:20.375
Isn't there an app?

32:20.958 --> 32:24.208
You take a picture,
and then it scans all the species.

32:25.291 --> 32:26.666
Sure, try it.

32:27.541 --> 32:28.666
I don't have the app.

32:29.166 --> 32:30.291
Then download it.

32:31.625 --> 32:32.708
Definitely.

32:36.666 --> 32:38.458
Marie, could you lend me a hand?

32:38.958 --> 32:39.958
Sure.

32:41.291 --> 32:42.583
Just hold it up.

32:43.083 --> 32:44.208
Watch out.

32:48.291 --> 32:49.291
Can I take it?

32:49.916 --> 32:50.916
Super.

32:52.125 --> 32:53.333
-Whoops.
-Be careful.

32:53.416 --> 32:54.458
I got it.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.750
-Hold it up to the light.
-Light.

32:57.833 --> 32:59.333
Okay, let's try.

33:10.208 --> 33:11.208
Try again.

33:17.541 --> 33:18.541
Found anything?

33:21.875 --> 33:22.708
Try again.

33:24.375 --> 33:25.375
Try again.

33:31.708 --> 33:33.583
-Can't find it?
-I said no.

33:33.666 --> 33:34.875
No hits?

33:34.958 --> 33:37.000
Nothing. I tried ten different apps now.

33:43.375 --> 33:44.583
That's the evidence.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.375
Do you follow?

34:07.625 --> 34:10.041
-Hey!
-Hi.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.208
-Look what I brought you.
-Thanks.

34:12.291 --> 34:15.125
-What's up? What are we celebrating?
-My breakthrough.

34:15.625 --> 34:17.458
-Yes?
-Emma's breakthrough, right?

34:18.500 --> 34:20.458
But I found the plant.

34:21.166 --> 34:25.208
-What plant?
-A plant which doesn't exist.

34:26.083 --> 34:29.833
-It doesn't exist? As in?
-As in, like I told you at the crater.

34:30.708 --> 34:32.666
We can't trace the origin of the matter.

34:32.750 --> 34:34.041
It's from another planet.

34:34.666 --> 34:35.875
I checked a bunch of apps.

34:35.958 --> 34:37.500
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

34:38.083 --> 34:40.833
It's true. You're not crazy.

34:41.416 --> 34:42.958
But it doesn't prove anything.

34:44.500 --> 34:47.750
-That you can't locate it on the apps.
-It was quite a few apps.

34:47.833 --> 34:48.750
It doesn't matter.

34:48.833 --> 34:51.500
If Hans is dead,
someone made him disappear.

34:53.583 --> 34:54.833
I was there.

34:56.583 --> 34:59.541
-What will they do to me?
-Astraeus.

34:59.625 --> 35:01.041
What about Astraeus?

35:01.125 --> 35:03.625
Maybe they made Hans disappear.

35:04.375 --> 35:06.708
There is nothing at Astraeus, Mads.

35:07.416 --> 35:08.833
Astraeus is totally normal.

35:10.583 --> 35:12.750
You're bitter you didn't find the plant.

35:12.833 --> 35:15.000
I don't give a shit about the plant.

35:15.083 --> 35:15.916
Clearly.

35:16.000 --> 35:16.875
Emma.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.250
Stop it.

35:24.750 --> 35:26.833
-Emma, wait.
-Let her go.

35:27.958 --> 35:29.041
What?

35:29.125 --> 35:31.375
That's what I want to know.
Why are you leaving?

35:32.083 --> 35:35.500
-Because I'm scared, Marie.
-Why?

35:36.458 --> 35:40.333
You were scared that you were crazy.
But you're not. That's a good thing.

35:40.416 --> 35:41.583
No, it isn't.

35:42.166 --> 35:43.500
I saw everything.

35:44.583 --> 35:45.583
Hans dying.

35:46.291 --> 35:47.291
The other guy…

35:47.875 --> 35:49.708
I don't even know what he was doing.

35:50.833 --> 35:52.666
Hans wanted something from me.

35:53.708 --> 35:54.958
He wanted to talk to me.

35:55.583 --> 35:57.958
I didn't ask for all this sci-fi bullshit.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.583
I just wanted
to watch dumb people with you.

36:04.541 --> 36:07.000
You can't always control
what you get involved in.

36:07.083 --> 36:08.833
Yes, you can.

36:08.916 --> 36:10.166
Mads is happy.

36:10.666 --> 36:13.375
He feels super clever
because he found the evidence.

36:13.458 --> 36:14.833
And I'm not crazy.

36:15.458 --> 36:16.541
Great.

36:18.250 --> 36:19.833
I want to return to normal.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.291
Can't this be normal?

36:21.375 --> 36:24.291
No, because that's the last thing this is.

36:31.125 --> 36:32.333
It's okay, Marie.

36:33.375 --> 36:35.708
I just won't be part of it.

37:17.958 --> 37:19.458
-What were you doing?
-Nothing.

37:50.500 --> 37:51.750
Who are you?

38:10.583 --> 38:12.250
What do you know about the organism?

38:12.916 --> 38:14.750
I don't know what you're talking about.

38:14.833 --> 38:16.083
Don't lie to me.

38:17.166 --> 38:18.541
I'm not.

38:19.375 --> 38:20.791
Why were you in the house?

38:20.875 --> 38:23.458
What did he say? Did he give you anything?

38:24.500 --> 38:27.916
He didn't tell me anything.
He didn't give me anything. I promise.

38:33.458 --> 38:35.250
You're lucky he didn't kill you.

38:37.250 --> 38:40.500
-Why would he kill me?
-Because that's what they do.

38:41.833 --> 38:45.750
They destroy and manipulate.
Take until there's nothing left to give.

38:47.583 --> 38:48.583
They're parasites.

38:49.583 --> 38:50.625
What is all this?

38:51.541 --> 38:54.416
The organism is trying to destroy you.

38:57.208 --> 38:58.958
They want to take over your planet.

38:59.041 --> 39:01.041
Just like they tried to take over mine.

39:02.791 --> 39:06.041
I'm here to stop them.
I need to know how many of them there are.

39:07.375 --> 39:08.666
And where they're hiding.

39:12.375 --> 39:14.083
I need you to stay away from me.

39:24.166 --> 39:25.125
Stop!

39:33.541 --> 39:34.958
Could you drive me home?

39:50.291 --> 39:51.375
What's your name?

39:54.791 --> 39:55.875
Lukas.

39:57.458 --> 39:58.291
Okay.

39:58.791 --> 40:02.000
You have a normal name,
you can drive a car, and…

40:02.833 --> 40:05.000
And now you're wearing that suit.

40:08.208 --> 40:09.333
What's wrong with it?

Are you sure he didn't give you
anything in the basement?

Someone found out what he was.
