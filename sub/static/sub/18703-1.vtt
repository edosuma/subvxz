00:33.675 --> 00:36.086
Yes, it is actually confirmed.

00:36.421 --> 00:39.803
1.6 million dollar prize pool!

00:39.808 --> 00:42.206
I'm double-checking to make sure
they haven't changed any details

00:42.208 --> 00:43.303
since they told us last time.

00:43.308 --> 00:46.753
1 million in US dollars for First Prize.

00:46.769 --> 00:46.858
That is for the winner.

00:47.660 --> 00:49.754
1 million dollars for winning Dota!

00:50.009 --> 00:51.450
It's going to be huge. Dota2.com

00:52.115 --> 00:54.120
The tournament tab is up, too.

00:54.166 --> 00:57.635
Our website will actually change
for the next 24 hours as well...

00:58.735 --> 01:02.392
The day I transformed into an adult was
the day I started playing Dota.

01:05.003 --> 01:07.842
Itâ€™s times like, when you
go up on the stage,

01:08.081 --> 01:10.323
you represent your country for something.

01:10.509 --> 01:11.530
You get the prize.

01:11.597 --> 01:14.663
It's the amount of satisfaction and
achievement that nothing else can give you.

01:15.299 --> 01:17.365
It's something I definitely
don't regret ever doing.

01:17.099 --> 01:20.104
Gaming is simply the proudest
thing in my life.

01:25.343 --> 01:29.397
It can be called "gamer," but for me,
it's something different.

01:30.432 --> 01:36.478
One way to forget about pain is to do
something that you will be in completely.

01:36.479 --> 01:38.292
So

01:38.293 --> 01:39.980
computer games.

01:40.789 --> 01:43.008
For me, it was

01:43.008 --> 01:44.945
everything.

01:49.063 --> 01:50.288
This is my career.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.804
I've chosen to do it for so long.

01:52.809 --> 01:56.851
Success in my eyes is always based
on how other people see you.

01:57.270 --> 01:58.611
In the eyes of the public,

01:58.066 --> 01:59.949
it's up to them.

02:05.548 --> 02:09.158
It's important to be doing things
that you love and you really appreciate.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.084
Because that's your passion, man.

02:10.809 --> 02:13.948
You should really work for your passions.

02:14.353 --> 02:17.344
Ok, guys, you have 7 minutes
to set everything up

02:17.345 --> 02:18.350
and then we go.

02:18.011 --> 02:20.819
This is the first time I really
wanted to take something seriously

02:21.513 --> 02:24.004
and do something good for my life.

02:41.013 --> 02:45.015
10 years ago, competitive gaming
wasn't even really a thing.

02:46.010 --> 02:48.044
You would play for fun
against your friends.

02:48.040 --> 02:51.831
Maybe you would play for a cup of coffee or
whatever you wanted.

02:52.209 --> 02:55.411
When I started playing,
we'd been fighting for

02:55.412 --> 02:57.686
24 bottles of beer as a first place.

02:58.173 --> 02:59.185
I'm not joking.

02:59.491 --> 03:02.005
From there, though, online happened.

03:02.006 --> 03:05.753
And, all of a sudden, you weren't
just trying to be the best on your block.

03:05.766 --> 03:07.587
Now you're trying to be the best
in the world.

03:07.588 --> 03:11.904
And that opened up competitive
gaming to a whole new landscape.

03:12.409 --> 03:15.434
And one of the games really
leading the way is Dota.

03:26.334 --> 03:30.627
Dota is sort of a combination of football
(or soccer for the Americans)

03:30.628 --> 03:31.662
and Chess.

03:31.900 --> 03:35.005
This is probably how I would try
to explain Dota

03:35.010 --> 03:37.405
to someone who's not familiar with it.

03:37.410 --> 03:39.505
At least, that's what I did to my parents.

03:42.672 --> 03:44.651
Dota is a game of momentum.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.588
You as 5 players

03:46.589 --> 03:49.135
try and battle against the other
5 players for momentum.

03:49.822 --> 03:52.668
Every single player controls one unit.

03:52.684 --> 03:57.126
And the main objective of the game is
to destroy the final enemy building

03:57.131 --> 04:01.006
which is called the "Ancient."

04:03.845 --> 04:05.953
Everything else that happens
in the meantime

04:05.954 --> 04:07.960
is your amazing filler of a game.

04:10.353 --> 04:12.466
You could play 100 heroes

04:12.471 --> 04:14.567
in conjunction with 99 other heroes.

04:16.050 --> 04:18.081
It's just nonstop possibilities

04:18.761 --> 04:20.906
and it's so much fun.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.068
And you know, it's like the same
map every single time

04:23.452 --> 04:25.947
but it literally never gets boring.

04:27.189 --> 04:30.174
I would say Dota is a way of life.

04:33.011 --> 04:35.046
When the prizes started coming

04:35.857 --> 04:38.349
I was like, well we have tournaments

04:38.350 --> 04:40.778
so obviously some people are going
to come and say,

04:40.779 --> 04:43.582
"This is a great game. Let's play it.
Like, let's put money in it."

04:43.583 --> 04:46.106
And it started progressing each year.

04:46.010 --> 04:48.107
Those at the top level,

04:48.508 --> 04:52.106
they just do like lots of
calculations in their head.

04:52.111 --> 04:53.936
Something like "A Beautiful Mind"

04:53.941 --> 04:55.556
where you see like all kinds of things.

04:55.561 --> 04:57.970
And using all this information

04:57.971 --> 04:59.014
make your next move.

04:59.010 --> 05:01.018
I see it in a lot of ways
similar to basketball.

05:02.211 --> 05:03.806
Just like a 5 on 5 game

05:03.811 --> 05:05.214
where you kind of have to work together

05:05.215 --> 05:09.146
and utilize each other's strengths and
synergizing everything together.

05:09.024 --> 05:11.063
The teamwork, and the trust,
and the sacrifice

05:11.028 --> 05:14.595
those are all true for every
single team sport.

05:16.086 --> 05:18.777
Dota is a game that unites everybody.

05:19.007 --> 05:21.099
It doesn't matter what country
you're from or race you are.

05:21.928 --> 05:23.679
It's kind of like a bond that is shared

05:23.680 --> 05:26.496
and when you're part of this
tight-knit group of people.

05:26.056 --> 05:28.352
It's like having a second family.

05:29.042 --> 05:31.705
That's something you never let go.

05:31.869 --> 05:34.002
Everyone's searching for something.

05:34.019 --> 05:35.063
Fulfillment.

05:35.070 --> 05:36.369
Fame.

05:37.273 --> 05:38.779
Satisfaction.

05:38.780 --> 05:41.789
It gives you the ability to
become someone else.

05:42.032 --> 05:44.126
A someone who is powerful.

05:44.352 --> 05:46.406
Who can take down 5 opponents.

05:46.923 --> 05:48.927
Express their creativity.

05:48.928 --> 05:52.484
Break the rules without actually
getting arrested.

05:52.929 --> 05:55.818
All of these reasons are
in there somewhere.

05:55.819 --> 05:58.207
The player himself might not even know.

05:58.264 --> 06:00.938
He might not even understand it himself.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.469
But it's there.

06:08.616 --> 06:12.101
Medford, Oregon

06:14.359 --> 06:16.957
Gaming fulfills my competitive need.

06:16.962 --> 06:18.770
I'm a very competitive person.

06:18.776 --> 06:21.367
When it comes to sports,
I consider gaming a sport.

06:21.372 --> 06:23.507
So I use my competitiveness

06:23.512 --> 06:24.807
and I fuel it with Dota.

06:24.088 --> 06:27.107
So it fulfills that side of me completely.

06:28.201 --> 06:31.016
Fear's one of the best
in America, if not the best.

06:31.022 --> 06:32.528
He has a lot of experience.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.197
He's one of the old hogs, basically.

06:34.202 --> 06:36.098
And he's generally just a calm guy.

06:36.103 --> 06:38.208
So, in my opinion, that's his strength.

06:38.213 --> 06:39.512
Really good basketball player.

06:39.517 --> 06:41.603
I remember my coaches watch him playing

06:41.014 --> 06:43.445
and just talk about picking him up
the next year when he came in.

06:44.044 --> 06:45.433
Always had nothing but good things to say,

06:45.051 --> 06:46.145
but he wasn't picked on the team.

06:47.383 --> 06:49.296
The reason was, yeah, he just
wasn't tall enough, I guess.

06:49.297 --> 06:51.008
So, I know that, yeah, he found the game.

06:51.013 --> 06:52.950
He got really devoted in that and stuff

06:52.955 --> 06:54.988
and just found something else that worked.

06:55.453 --> 06:57.474
I was your typical parent.

06:57.732 --> 07:01.571
"Clinton, you're spending too
much time playing computer games."

07:01.572 --> 07:03.025
"You need to go to school."

07:03.026 --> 07:04.573
"You need to go to college."

07:04.845 --> 07:05.758
and he would tell me,

07:05.763 --> 07:08.840
"I want to be able to play
games and get paid for it."

07:09.061 --> 07:11.700
Now he said this at a very young age

07:12.025 --> 07:14.249
before Dota ever came along.

07:14.012 --> 07:16.018
And I thought, well, you know,
he's going to grow out of it.

07:17.013 --> 07:19.908
He's going to get sick and
tired of sitting there

07:19.913 --> 07:21.170
in front of that computer and playing.

07:21.175 --> 07:23.183
Never did. Never did.

07:27.137 --> 07:30.124
Singapore

07:30.010 --> 07:33.224
In Singapore the families actually
put a lot of stress on us

07:33.423 --> 07:35.595
in terms of our education.

07:35.999 --> 07:38.336
I would say it's been tough on me
trying to juggle

07:38.337 --> 07:41.208
both studies and gaming at the same time.

07:41.054 --> 07:43.926
My grades have dropped for
two years already.

07:44.341 --> 07:47.869
And my parents have treated
the gaming as the cause of it.

07:48.036 --> 07:51.054
I mean there was this phrase that
they used. They said,

07:51.055 --> 07:53.582
"Gaming will be the death of you one day."

07:55.074 --> 07:57.833
He's a great player and a great captain.

07:58.162 --> 08:00.873
I would say he's the top player
in Singapore.

08:01.334 --> 08:02.326
Easily.

08:03.094 --> 08:05.351
My parents and my family,

08:05.356 --> 08:07.810
they don't actually speak much
of my gaming career.

08:07.811 --> 08:10.474
They don't tell their friends
and my other relatives

08:10.475 --> 08:12.708
that I'm actually that good at my games.

08:12.736 --> 08:15.736
All along they have only been
bragging about my studies.

08:15.737 --> 08:17.320
Because I used to be an "A" student.

08:17.321 --> 08:19.727
Yeah, they go on and on. And

08:19.795 --> 08:23.839
And it seemed like that was the only thing
they could ever be proud of.

08:23.997 --> 08:26.014
Actually, there has only been one person

08:26.010 --> 08:28.152
that has always been very
supportive of me gaming.

08:28.166 --> 08:31.745
And that was my ex-girlfriend, Huayan.

08:31.088 --> 08:33.091
She's from the female Dota team
in Singapore.

08:34.010 --> 08:35.106
There are a lot of things
that we share in life.

08:36.073 --> 08:37.076
So many things.

08:37.134 --> 08:39.207
In my case, it felt really good,
you know, to have someone

08:39.095 --> 08:41.149
who truly appreciated what you did best.

08:42.414 --> 08:43.749
And loved you for it.

08:43.755 --> 08:47.747
She was aware of what I'm doing
and what I'm passionate about.

08:48.622 --> 08:52.499
The breakup was her decision
and I respected it.

08:52.504 --> 08:54.979
We'd been together for close to three years

08:54.984 --> 08:57.549
and ever since the breakup,
I haven't gotten over it.

08:57.564 --> 08:59.343
I recall the last time she spoke to me

08:59.344 --> 09:01.927
she named me as a bastard so

09:02.650 --> 09:03.604
*Laughter*

09:04.473 --> 09:07.561
We're not in contact anymore,
yeah, but

09:07.017 --> 09:09.172
life goes on.

09:11.487 --> 09:14.706
L'viv, Ukraine

09:20.015 --> 09:21.723
I'm from Ukraine.

09:22.223 --> 09:23.970
My nickname is Dendi.

09:23.975 --> 09:26.280
I finished my university, and

09:26.285 --> 09:29.381
I'm just playing computer games right now.

09:33.056 --> 09:34.290
He was doing music.

09:34.295 --> 09:36.260
He played the piano.

09:36.265 --> 09:38.569
He was doing dancing.

09:38.608 --> 09:43.429
At school, he had musical plays in
which he played the main role.

09:43.052 --> 09:47.374
Audiences were always
impressed by his artistic ability.

09:48.197 --> 09:50.445
When their kids' group was showing,

09:50.446 --> 09:52.430
Danil would always stand out.

09:54.212 --> 09:55.795
When we were growing up

09:55.796 --> 09:58.642
it wasn't a good time financially
for our family.

09:58.643 --> 10:04.435
But my grandma helped us
to get our first computer in 1997.

10:04.436 --> 10:08.022
Early, compared with other kids in Ukraine.

10:08.157 --> 10:10.290
We got visitors every day.

10:10.658 --> 10:13.949
The friends of my older brother
used to come to visit us

10:13.104 --> 10:15.067
and we were playing games.

10:15.914 --> 10:19.803
And Danil, every time looked at what we do.

10:19.804 --> 10:21.829
Every time we would try to push him away

10:21.092 --> 10:23.636
but he would come back and look again.

10:24.877 --> 10:30.752
It was more prominent with him
than with other kids.

10:31.087 --> 10:33.093
During all his conscious life

10:33.139 --> 10:35.623
we were trying to stop him from playing.

10:35.947 --> 10:39.686
We were hiding our computer cord
everywhere in our apartment

10:39.687 --> 10:41.585
but he always found it.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.829
I always wanted to understand him better.

10:44.830 --> 10:48.322
Including that hobby, I wanted
to understand him better.

10:48.399 --> 10:50.236
There were certain reasons.

10:50.237 --> 10:52.466
I'm not going to mention them now.

10:52.698 --> 10:57.181
I think somewhere deep
inside he's a little bit sad.

10:57.386 --> 11:00.447
She stopped preventing him
from playing Dota.

11:01.193 --> 11:04.506
She gave Dendi the freedom to choose

11:04.747 --> 11:06.805
what is the best for him and his life.

11:14.588 --> 11:17.871
Tournaments back then were
really low prizes.

11:17.876 --> 11:20.689
And a lot of prize money didn't
even get to the players.

11:20.690 --> 11:24.945
There's been a lot of scams with
the managers and stuff like that.

11:25.246 --> 11:29.803
There were, like, some rumors that
it's going to be $50,000 first place,

11:29.804 --> 11:33.573
and everyone was going, like,
"Nah, it's not going to be like that."

11:33.578 --> 11:36.065
August 10, 2011

11:36.527 --> 11:38.528
Watch the forums go nuts, guys.

11:38.628 --> 11:40.526
Watch the forums go nuts.

11:40.527 --> 11:42.233
It is actually confirmed.

11:42.234 --> 11:45.133
It is off the fricking hook.

11:45.134 --> 11:49.105
1.6 million dollar prize pool!

11:49.106 --> 11:50.110
That is for the winner,

11:50.012 --> 11:53.818
1 million dollars for winning Dota!

11:57.016 --> 11:59.612
Dota, the game I've played for 5 years now.

11:59.617 --> 12:01.482
Which I played for fun.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.512
For some food money or whatever, you know.

12:03.517 --> 12:05.102
Ok, it's actually getting big.

12:05.107 --> 12:09.870
It's the largest prize pool of any
gaming competition to date.

12:09.871 --> 12:13.570
It just felt like the start
of something big.

12:13.571 --> 12:14.578
Like a revolution.

12:15.374 --> 12:17.345
You know, we had everything we needed

12:17.346 --> 12:20.658
for the game to become big and
respected as an E Sport.

12:20.080 --> 12:22.677
It would kind of like vindicate us.

12:23.958 --> 12:26.975
We're not just playing
because we're addicted.

12:26.976 --> 12:29.453
There's a goal, a motive.

12:29.836 --> 12:33.734
That we can actually reach out and
grab if we are good enough.

12:41.094 --> 12:45.106
Beijing, China

12:56.073 --> 12:59.774
Over in Asia, professional gamers
are treated like rock stars.

12:59.784 --> 13:03.280
It's a viable career opportunity.

13:03.298 --> 13:05.382
They actually live in gamer houses.

13:05.387 --> 13:07.872
So it's set up to be a thing all year long.

13:07.879 --> 13:12.234
I think their approach to practice
is that it's like a day job.

13:12.248 --> 13:14.044
The fan base is immense.

13:14.049 --> 13:18.145
It probably is as big as the
whole western audience together.

13:18.150 --> 13:19.173
Or even more than that.

13:19.178 --> 13:20.885
So now you really have to play good.

13:20.890 --> 13:22.505
You really have to try hard.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.812
It's first place. It's go big or go home.

13:25.308 --> 13:27.214
The big teams get big money.

13:27.215 --> 13:29.973
But the 9th to 16th place earn nothing.

13:29.978 --> 13:31.993
And their salaries are not
worth considering.

13:32.025 --> 13:35.312
While in sports, you have a salary
that you can live on.

13:35.429 --> 13:38.583
With pro gaming, I think that's
one of the toughest parts is

13:38.588 --> 13:39.803
living game to game.

13:39.808 --> 13:41.273
It's like living paycheck to paycheck.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.873
Like, I have to win.
If I don't win, I don't get paid.

13:43.878 --> 13:45.904
That's a tough living for anybody.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.499
It doesn't matter what you're doing.

13:48.065 --> 13:51.274
When your child wants
to be a professional gamer

13:51.279 --> 13:53.527
you don't have any history to look back on

13:53.535 --> 13:55.248
like other sports.

13:55.267 --> 13:58.471
I don't know anyone who's
made a living at gaming.

13:58.476 --> 14:00.485
So it's kind of a scary thing

14:00.486 --> 14:04.989
when you see your kid putting
their whole life into gaming

14:04.990 --> 14:08.053
and not college and
not the traditional things.

14:08.474 --> 14:10.052
What if nothing comes of it?

14:11.042 --> 14:12.158
Regarding the age

14:12.159 --> 14:13.159
I think, yes,

14:13.654 --> 14:18.907
25, 26 years.
It's absolutely maximum for E Sports

14:18.908 --> 14:21.356
because 27, 28, 29, 30

14:21.357 --> 14:23.851
your reaction time is lowering

14:23.852 --> 14:26.749
and you can't click so much, you know,

14:27.045 --> 14:28.050
as the kids do.

14:28.104 --> 14:32.113
A lot of financial responsibilities
are laid upon me right now.

14:32.933 --> 14:37.946
Require me to be successful
in something or have a job.

14:37.951 --> 14:41.348
So it's pretty critical that
I am successful

14:41.353 --> 14:44.882
if I want to continue the gaming career.

14:46.296 --> 14:48.575
He's an "A-Star" student, you know?

14:48.580 --> 14:52.168
Because of this gaming,
it pulled him right down.

14:52.173 --> 14:54.614
It's very sad for me.

14:54.831 --> 14:57.884
So here the bad one is Auntie.

14:57.892 --> 14:59.856
Auntie is the one that always
comes here and

14:59.862 --> 15:02.529
nag, nag, nag, nag, nag.

15:02.697 --> 15:05.023
- Am I right?
- It's tough being a gamer.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.243
Sorry?

15:06.037 --> 15:09.046
- Am I right?
- I said, it's tough being a gamer.

15:09.339 --> 15:13.352
Huh, hy? Multi-millionaire.

15:13.753 --> 15:13.756
*Laughter*

15:14.053 --> 15:15.944
For gaming, huh?

15:17.049 --> 15:19.924
Sorry, you are not.

15:20.069 --> 15:23.147
Huh? What is your view?
What is your plan?

15:24.349 --> 15:26.114
That is more important.

15:26.119 --> 15:27.584
I mean, we speak ourselves.

15:27.589 --> 15:30.542
We speak our frank opinion.

15:30.547 --> 15:32.278
This is your choice now.

15:32.288 --> 15:36.003
What do you want in life?
That is more important.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.134
If I'm going to win this tournament

15:39.135 --> 15:40.504
my first thought would be

15:40.509 --> 15:43.854
I will call my ex-girlfriend.

15:43.859 --> 15:45.518
Things got real bad between us and

15:45.523 --> 15:47.844
but right now, for me, if I'm going
to win this tournament,

15:47.849 --> 15:49.844
my first thought would be,
yeah, I would call her.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.316
I would tell her about it and

15:51.321 --> 15:53.486
I would want to share this moment with her

15:53.491 --> 15:54.815
yeah.

15:59.448 --> 16:03.045
This tournament is going to be
a moment in every gamer's life.

16:03.050 --> 16:06.045
Everything that you've been
doing has been building up

16:06.050 --> 16:07.923
and is going to happen over one week.

16:07.924 --> 16:10.018
And then it's not one week anymore.

16:10.019 --> 16:11.115
It's one game.

16:11.127 --> 16:12.515
And then it's not that one game.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.092
it's that one moment in the game.

16:14.097 --> 16:17.316
And then that one moment in the
game is where it's going to finish.

16:17.321 --> 16:18.470
And how's it going to finish?

16:18.061 --> 16:20.119
Are you going to be holding up a trophy?

16:21.060 --> 16:27.118
Or are you going to be the most
disappointed that you've ever been?

16:34.879 --> 16:37.635
Cologne, Germany

16:37.640 --> 16:38.605
It's Tuesday.

16:38.610 --> 16:39.965
So one day before the event.

16:39.970 --> 16:41.595
We already have a lot of setup.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.425
We have a lot of computer setup right here.

16:43.430 --> 16:46.508
The whole booth construction
pretty much finished.

16:46.531 --> 16:48.418
So five players per side.

16:48.423 --> 16:50.018
They can see each other through the glass.

16:50.023 --> 16:51.515
They can't hear each other.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.016
This booth is soundproofed up.

16:53.021 --> 16:55.004
Plus, the whole setup here

16:55.009 --> 16:58.515
if you look from above looks
exactly like a Dota map.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.735
And this is the mid.

16:59.740 --> 17:01.043
This is where it all happens.

17:01.112 --> 17:02.815
A few teams have already
arrived this morning.

17:02.820 --> 17:03.985
We had a lot of teams

17:03.990 --> 17:04.885
from Singapore.

17:04.890 --> 17:04.958
We have China.

17:05.070 --> 17:06.252
We had Malaysia coming in

17:06.762 --> 17:07.958
and Russia.

17:07.963 --> 17:11.376
And tomorrow it's finally happening.

17:18.162 --> 17:22.015
We're here live at Gamescom
2011 in beautiful Cologne.

17:22.016 --> 17:24.209
It's the first day of the event.

17:24.214 --> 17:26.642
We've got some of the world's
best teams here in Dota.

17:26.646 --> 17:31.015
And they're handing out a tournament
prize of 1.6 million dollars!

17:31.016 --> 17:33.016
It is massive here.

17:33.028 --> 17:35.016
A tournament of 1.6 million dollars.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.635
That's the future of gaming.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.636
This is awesome!

17:43.408 --> 17:46.161
It's the first time we're
going to see teams

17:46.174 --> 17:48.816
of this caliber assembled
in one location.

17:48.841 --> 17:51.716
These guys are not just nameless faces.

17:51.723 --> 17:53.980
They're the best in the world.

17:58.524 --> 18:00.563
The bunch of teams we have here,

18:00.564 --> 18:04.210
there's a few teams that have individual
skill that's unbelievable.

18:04.211 --> 18:06.494
And then there's a big group of other teams

18:06.499 --> 18:08.426
that have good individual skill,
not top-notch,

18:08.431 --> 18:10.996
but who win through good
strategy and team play.

18:10.997 --> 18:12.065
Fear is a great player, for example,

18:12.678 --> 18:16.162
but he is not comparable
to good players in Asia.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.992
And that's nothing against Fear,
because he's still an excellent player

18:19.001 --> 18:20.790
but he's not them.

18:37.429 --> 18:40.663
Over in Asia, they take gaming
so much more seriously.

18:40.664 --> 18:42.278
Just to give you an example,

18:42.279 --> 18:46.262
the Korean soccer team were
playing in the World Cup.

18:46.263 --> 18:49.852
To motivate the Korean soccer
team to play better,

18:49.853 --> 18:54.799
they brought in Starcraft Brood War
professional gamers

18:54.800 --> 18:57.509
into their locker room before they went out

18:57.510 --> 19:00.497
so that they got to meet
what were their heroes.

19:00.993 --> 19:02.445
Shanghai, China

19:02.446 --> 19:06.453
In China, Dota is to the people
there what Starcraft is to Korea.

19:06.951 --> 19:07.026
It's televised.

19:08.064 --> 19:11.027
The girls like their boyfriends
to be Dota players.

19:14.868 --> 19:17.040
After a game, when they're walking around

19:17.041 --> 19:18.669
you can see fans running up to them

19:18.670 --> 19:20.022
asking them to sign on their shirts.

19:20.405 --> 19:21.405
It's like a real sport.

19:24.006 --> 19:25.457
The third time I was in China,

19:25.458 --> 19:27.466
I was playing with fans for two days.

19:27.062 --> 19:28.249
They made a video of me,

19:28.655 --> 19:29.731
filming me walking in some mountains

19:30.021 --> 19:31.963
and I had to say some sentences and stuff.

19:34.104 --> 19:38.058
And I was like, yeah, "In Dota,
there's always a new mountain to climb."

19:38.864 --> 19:40.317
Stuff like this, you know.

19:41.592 --> 19:43.592
I walked up and down these stairs

19:43.593 --> 19:46.028
and started running and
lifting some weights,

19:46.029 --> 19:49.025
just to compare this with Dota
like some metaphor and stuff.

19:49.249 --> 19:51.254
Fuzhou, I am coming!

19:51.080 --> 19:54.055
E Sports in China is already a sport

19:54.614 --> 19:58.581
that is recognized by the
General Administration of Sport.

19:58.582 --> 20:00.594
It is the same as tennis, ping pong, chess.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.102
The only thing is that it is
not an Olympic sport.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.054
I will say that China teams are all great.

20:05.514 --> 20:07.519
Every player in the team is strong.

20:08.031 --> 20:10.046
You don't recognize China
players as a player.

20:10.182 --> 20:11.361
You just recognize them as a whole team.

20:11.362 --> 20:12.893
You just fear the whole team.

20:14.066 --> 20:17.087
The Chinese teams that have
come to this competition

20:17.872 --> 20:20.847
are scaring the shit out of everyone else.

20:24.507 --> 20:27.312
We had two of the top
Chinese teams in our group.

20:27.841 --> 20:31.376
Online Kingdom has not been
regarded as one of the favorites to win it.

20:31.377 --> 20:35.799
In fact, they were considered bottom four
or just bottom eight for sure.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.894
This is our first time on LAN together.

20:37.895 --> 20:40.911
The team together has only been
around for around 4-5 months

20:40.912 --> 20:42.530
so it's a relatively new team,

20:42.531 --> 20:45.679
and Pajkatt, our newest addition,
playing Carry for us,

20:45.680 --> 20:48.667
he's only been on the team for
three weeks now actually.

20:49.279 --> 20:52.067
We were really nervous going
against a Chinese team

20:52.023 --> 20:54.056
especially the top Chinese teams.

20:54.590 --> 20:55.934
There are going to be players that choke

20:55.935 --> 20:59.029
handling this kind of pressure
at such a young age.

20:59.030 --> 21:02.996
1437, this is the first time he's
ever been on LAN.

21:03.183 --> 21:05.435
It's not easy, like, this is a
million dollar tournament.

21:05.436 --> 21:06.055
First time he's been on LAN.

21:06.055 --> 21:08.163
LAN (LOCAL AREA NETWORK) A TOURNAMENT WHERE
ALL THE TEAMS COMPETE IN THE SAME LOCATION

21:08.164 --> 21:10.081
This stage. This prize money.
This prestige.

21:10.082 --> 21:11.051
This is real competition.

21:11.811 --> 21:13.085
We tried to keep our cool together

21:13.086 --> 21:14.640
and we just played our game.

21:43.165 --> 21:44.194
We were super hyped.

21:44.195 --> 21:46.490
Everyone was surprised
we were doing so good.

21:46.491 --> 21:47.812
Even we couldn't believe it.

21:48.019 --> 21:51.151
Online Kingdom dominating right now.

22:03.020 --> 22:06.962
After the match against TyLoo,
everyone was very excited, you know.

22:06.114 --> 22:10.235
We just beat one of the teams that was
actually favored to win the competition.

22:11.091 --> 22:12.818
So everyone's spirits were, like,

22:12.027 --> 22:14.644
"Oh, we may be actually
able to do this, you know."

22:17.577 --> 22:18.828
Beating the Chinese teams,

22:19.241 --> 22:21.820
some people just, you know
for fun, they started,

22:21.821 --> 22:24.826
"Ok, hey, it's OK.Nirvana.Int.
They're the China slayers."

22:30.067 --> 22:32.345
A few little bit surprises that
we had yesterday.

22:32.769 --> 22:33.786
Quite a few upsets.

22:33.787 --> 22:37.444
OK.Nirvana.International managing
to beat two Chinese teams in a row,

22:37.445 --> 22:40.398
beating out TyLoo and OK.Nirvana.CN.

22:40.399 --> 22:42.026
They're currently on a roll now.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.052
And Chinese teams are not unbeatable.

22:44.537 --> 22:45.865
But on the other hand,

22:45.866 --> 22:49.882
EHOME are just proving that they are
the strongest of the four Chinese teams

22:49.883 --> 22:51.838
having a clean 3-0 record.

22:51.839 --> 22:53.906
They are the favorites to win
the whole tournament.

22:53.907 --> 22:55.891
So they come in with the confidence

22:55.892 --> 22:57.879
that they've won so many
championships already.

22:57.106 --> 22:59.102
It's always a little bit of
national pride at stake.

22:59.877 --> 23:01.481
So, of course, they want
to prove that Chinese

23:01.494 --> 23:02.972
Dota is still a little
bit above the rest.

23:05.536 --> 23:09.490
EHOME is one of the oldest
Chinese Dota organizations.

23:09.491 --> 23:12.145
They've always been at the
top of competitive gaming.

23:12.146 --> 23:15.133
Most memorably at ESWC 2010.

23:16.144 --> 23:18.144
Before ESWC 2010,

23:18.145 --> 23:19.128
I thought, like, yeah ok,

23:19.129 --> 23:21.104
the Chinese, they're probably pretty good,

23:21.105 --> 23:23.046
but like how good can they be?

23:23.047 --> 23:27.005
And then we played EHOME who won that
tournament without losing a single match.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.053
Like, they just crushed every team.

23:28.898 --> 23:32.873
EHOME finished the year as
the best team in the history of Dota.

23:33.398 --> 23:34.406
They were just like on a
totally different level.

23:35.199 --> 23:37.447
Like, they had their manager
sitting behind them.

23:37.448 --> 23:38.444
He was making their calls.

23:38.445 --> 23:40.700
He was running around with this
little black book.

23:40.701 --> 23:43.684
And they were the first team
I heard of who did that.

23:44.133 --> 23:47.387
The EHOME manager copying down
the draft, doing the prep work.

23:47.388 --> 23:48.553
He was their coach.

23:48.964 --> 23:50.956
There was a great interview that was done.

23:51.040 --> 23:54.056
And it lined up all the top European
captains who attended

23:54.228 --> 23:56.157
and the topic was EHOME.

23:56.158 --> 23:57.191
If you want to ever play good

23:57.192 --> 23:58.290
you don't need to invite Chinese teams

23:59.173 --> 24:00.189
because they are too strong.

24:01.143 --> 24:02.156
So EHOME won

24:03.032 --> 24:05.057
What do you think of the Chinese guys?

24:05.058 --> 24:08.079
I never felt this outplayed
in my entire life.

24:08.269 --> 24:10.265
It's unbelievable how good they are.

24:10.266 --> 24:11.813
Like, their timing, their discipline

24:11.814 --> 24:13.590
They're really in control
of the game, the whole game,

24:13.078 --> 24:14.479
and they keep this control all the time.

24:14.993 --> 24:16.935
This is really crazy to see, actually.

24:17.337 --> 24:20.262
It's because when we are at
any international tournament,

24:21.082 --> 24:25.045
when all of the foreign team managers
and team members see us,

24:25.046 --> 24:27.104
everyone will all yell out, "EHOME!"

24:27.105 --> 24:30.080
EHOME! EHOME!

24:30.027 --> 24:32.314
Do you know how spectacular that is?

24:32.369 --> 24:34.577
Actually, this is a story. It's a custom.

24:34.578 --> 24:37.322
Which is when everyone sees EHOME,

24:37.323 --> 24:40.799
they naturally think the king is entering.

24:45.482 --> 24:46.958
During this trip to The International,

24:47.228 --> 24:50.294
it's actually the same period
as my exam periods.

24:50.295 --> 24:54.376
So I treated it as a sacrifice
that I've made

24:54.377 --> 24:55.619
for the team and for myself.

24:56.208 --> 24:57.221
And I find that

24:57.528 --> 24:59.411
when it comes to pursuing your passions

24:59.412 --> 25:01.847
it's really up to you to decide
if it's worth the

25:02.032 --> 25:03.057
worth the sacrifice.

25:10.249 --> 25:14.261
When they're having exams,
they don't allow him to leave the school

25:15.074 --> 25:18.062
So I told him really I said,
"Mind yourself."

25:19.726 --> 25:23.023
Setting out on a career in gaming
is risky. It's very risky.

25:23.659 --> 25:25.694
Because the examinations actually
clash with the competition

25:26.010 --> 25:29.412
and missing the exams without
a proper explanation,

25:29.413 --> 25:32.945
the school didn't recognize the Dota
competition as a valid reason.

25:33.646 --> 25:35.209
It's kind of breaking school rules.

25:36.005 --> 25:38.580
The school is very determined
to stop him from pursuing

25:38.581 --> 25:41.577
his chance of going for this contest.

25:42.390 --> 25:47.348
So I think this has created
a big stress for the family.

25:49.290 --> 25:51.315
Gives his mother very headache, you know?

25:57.056 --> 26:00.525
It's quite difficult for us
to pull him out right now, I think.

26:00.526 --> 26:02.502
You know he's so adamant about it.

26:02.503 --> 26:05.260
So that's why when he told me
he's going in August,

26:05.261 --> 26:08.654
I said, "Then how about your school exams?"

26:08.655 --> 26:10.734
"What are you going to do?"

26:12.050 --> 26:14.071
I think my mother,
she was kind of at her limits,

26:14.557 --> 26:17.322
telling me about how much gaming
has been weighing me down.

26:17.323 --> 26:19.659
That was really the talk when I really
opened my heart and I

26:20.456 --> 26:21.829
shared with her my passion for the game

26:21.830 --> 26:22.847
and how much I believed that

26:23.134 --> 26:25.696
my team actually has the potential to win,

26:25.705 --> 26:26.697
to be the best in the world.

26:27.064 --> 26:29.162
So we are stopping at nothing
less than first.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.335
This is how I tried to put it
across to my mom.

26:32.829 --> 26:34.173
By giving up so much to come here

26:34.174 --> 26:36.430
I have absolute confidence
in my team that we will win.

26:37.366 --> 26:39.207
Alright the draft is under way.

26:39.208 --> 26:41.216
EHOME, they will select up their heroes.

26:41.217 --> 26:42.781
Scythe will start selecting theirs.

26:43.062 --> 26:44.417
Looking now at both the teams,

26:44.418 --> 26:46.165
it looks like EHOME they're fairly relaxed

26:46.166 --> 26:47.773
while Scythe, you know they're eager.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.841
They're all gathering around hyhy to pick.

26:50.437 --> 26:52.416
If you have a losing draft,
you will lose the game.

26:52.828 --> 26:53.866
This is what I think of Dota.

26:55.290 --> 26:57.323
So it's really a lot on drafting.

26:57.427 --> 27:01.402
Drafting is where two captains will
select what they want to play with.

27:01.061 --> 27:04.040
What heroes are selected
and what heroes are taken out.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.740
You can select five heroes
out of a pool of over a hundred.

27:07.741 --> 27:09.741
And can also remove four of those heroes.

27:09.852 --> 27:12.827
So four heroes you think
your opponent will want to use,

27:12.828 --> 27:13.930
you can remove.

27:14.355 --> 27:16.538
Before any game, any match,

27:16.539 --> 27:18.106
we will decide our bans and picks

27:18.107 --> 27:20.115
according to which team we are fighting.

27:20.460 --> 27:23.468
Usually we would come up with
a very impromptu strategy

27:23.469 --> 27:25.082
to try and fight their strat (strategy).

27:25.029 --> 27:27.467
You really have to spend a lot
of time thinking of the draft.

27:27.522 --> 27:30.489
The draft actually decides
a lot of the game itself.

27:31.805 --> 27:33.846
EHOME. They're a team
with so much experience.

27:34.244 --> 27:36.232
They already know the way
they want to roll this one out.

27:36.044 --> 27:37.138
The only thing that's really going to
make it or break it for them

27:38.174 --> 27:40.161
is if they can get their execution right.

27:41.538 --> 27:42.530
In that particular match-up

27:42.531 --> 27:45.626
we felt that we needed something
that could instill the fear in them.

27:47.113 --> 27:49.605
And Tiny looks to be the last pickup
here from Scythe.

27:49.981 --> 27:51.715
A bit of an interesting pickup
there by Scythe.

27:51.716 --> 27:54.435
It's going to start to change around
their lanes completely now.

27:54.436 --> 27:56.531
With Tiny, it is good as
a surprise strategy.

27:57.387 --> 28:00.878
If another team doesn't realize where
he fits into the whole lineup,

28:00.879 --> 28:03.333
then you can really throw
the opposition off balance.

28:03.033 --> 28:04.959
He's moving away, but no, hyhy,

28:05.876 --> 28:07.953
he'll just turn around and
just pops the Lina.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.972
I want to point out right now that EHOME,

28:10.090 --> 28:11.829
they are not noobs (new to the game).

28:12.028 --> 28:15.740
This is just Scythe playing
an amazing game.

28:16.301 --> 28:18.273
When you have such a huge audience and

28:18.049 --> 28:20.078
you know that everyone is at home
watching the game

28:20.052 --> 28:21.098
they have their hopes pinned on you and

28:22.326 --> 28:23.411
I feel that

28:23.522 --> 28:24.773
there's so much at stake.

28:26.001 --> 28:27.878
And they should be able to
clean it up right now.

28:27.955 --> 28:31.250
Tiny, he's gonna toss, he's gonna launch
and he definitely gets the kill.

28:31.407 --> 28:34.664
We got 357 getting nailed out there.

28:34.829 --> 28:37.290
Nature's Prophet going to get
the last hit in as well.

28:37.291 --> 28:39.585
It's the entire team down for EHOME.

28:39.829 --> 28:40.996
This is GG.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.672
This is now a double-rax, at least.

28:43.673 --> 28:45.717
And EHOME, they're going to disconnect.

28:45.718 --> 28:48.515
We have our first
Winner's Bracket Finalist.

28:48.517 --> 28:49.538
Scythe will advance.

28:49.728 --> 28:53.055
EHOME will drop down into
the Loser's Bracket,

28:53.205 --> 28:55.320
and Scythe will now finish up this game.

29:00.582 --> 29:02.251
Yeah, the one million is

29:02.907 --> 29:04.409
yeah, one million.

29:05.491 --> 29:06.659
That's a lot.

29:08.038 --> 29:10.624
It's going to make my time
playing this game all worth it.

29:14.527 --> 29:17.614
Didn't think smoking would do me any good.

29:19.437 --> 29:20.396
When did you start smoking?

29:24.947 --> 29:26.448
Two years back.

29:26.449 --> 29:27.283
Two years back.

29:28.441 --> 29:29.400
Bad move.

29:31.160 --> 29:34.914
That seems to coincide with when you
and your ex-girlfriend broke up.

29:43.908 --> 29:45.534
On bad terms

29:46.210 --> 29:47.795
Seems like she's moved on already.

29:48.636 --> 29:49.929
Back then when she was playing the game

29:49.930 --> 29:52.766
it felt like we had something we shared.

29:53.373 --> 29:54.499
Yeah, but right now, it's like

29:58.344 --> 30:01.806
I think she's following this event, but

30:02.894 --> 30:03.561
probably

30:03.562 --> 30:04.563
This event's big.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.147
I hope I will get to make that phone call.

30:17.230 --> 30:19.941
Finally I'll have something I'm proud of
to tell her about.

30:20.217 --> 30:21.093
Finally.

30:37.035 --> 30:39.163
When you played the Russians
and the Ukrainians,

30:39.311 --> 30:40.937
they were just the unpredictable teams.

30:41.385 --> 30:43.513
I had no idea what the Russians
were thinking.

30:43.831 --> 30:45.166
That was their best weapon.

30:46.140 --> 30:47.161
Well, we're having fun.

30:47.085 --> 30:49.420
We're trying to relax.

30:50.225 --> 30:52.394
We're trying to scare our opponents.

30:52.735 --> 30:54.154
Mind games. Mind games.

30:55.689 --> 31:00.026
I turn off my brain in the way
of being scared of someone.

31:00.941 --> 31:03.736
One of the things I really
admire about him is how

31:04.337 --> 31:05.408
he hasn't really had an easy life

31:06.588 --> 31:09.216
but he's always so upbeat.

31:09.575 --> 31:10.868
He's always so cheerful.

31:11.305 --> 31:12.557
When he first came on the Dota scene,

31:12.558 --> 31:14.539
he looked like a 12-year-old boy.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.251
Everyone was just, like, "Who is this kid?"

31:17.252 --> 31:18.323
There's no way you can
take this guy seriously.

31:19.173 --> 31:21.300
And then he would destroy you in games!

31:22.072 --> 31:24.164
I saw somewhere on the internet

31:25.603 --> 31:28.981
how he works with the keyboard.

31:28.982 --> 31:32.505
It really is mesmerizing.

31:44.637 --> 31:49.643
I think Danil benefited
from his piano playing

31:49.644 --> 31:52.647
because his hands are absolutely amazing.

31:54.443 --> 31:55.736
He can make really good moves.

31:55.888 --> 31:58.057
His moves, I think are unique,

31:58.041 --> 32:00.418
and they might win you the game.

32:01.030 --> 32:03.074
But he wants to rely completely on skill.

32:03.075 --> 32:04.994
He wants, like, an enemy against him

32:04.995 --> 32:07.789
and he wants to kill him through skill,
nothing more.

32:07.790 --> 32:09.221
He wants to win the game.

32:09.222 --> 32:11.840
His disadvantage is that
he doesn't have patience.

32:11.841 --> 32:12.912
He wants to make those moves.

32:13.749 --> 32:15.793
He can get a little bit too silly in games.

32:15.973 --> 32:18.267
He will try new and different things.

32:18.268 --> 32:20.437
He will overextend in team fights

32:20.438 --> 32:22.023
because he believes he can get the kill.

32:22.024 --> 32:23.948
And his impatience can go too far

32:23.949 --> 32:25.534
and he might lose the game for us.

32:33.056 --> 32:34.433
Oh, Nature's Prophet, he's going to go in.

32:34.695 --> 32:35.821
This should be the First Blood.

32:35.822 --> 32:37.615
They got the Sprout on Sansheng as well.

32:37.616 --> 32:38.867
There's probably going to be a double.

32:38.868 --> 32:40.912
Dendi's ulti, it hits!

32:41.913 --> 32:43.039
Dendi, Dendi, no, no.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.751
He's not he cannot be.

32:44.752 --> 32:45.826
This is Dendi through and through.

32:46.493 --> 32:49.622
Starts with the Hex, goes to Cold
Snap, he locks him in place!

32:49.764 --> 32:51.682
Weaver really close to death!

32:51.683 --> 32:53.435
Manages to Timelapse back out again.

32:53.865 --> 32:56.326
Dendi will TP (teleport) back to safety.

32:56.999 --> 32:59.351
So GG being called by iG.

32:59.352 --> 33:01.380
Na'Vi, they will take the game.

33:01.612 --> 33:06.549
Our Winners Bracket Finalists are
going to be Na'Vi versus Scythe.

33:11.699 --> 33:16.383
Most teams that you see that have
the most fan bases are full nationality.

33:16.384 --> 33:18.930
Our team is all spread out
across the world.

33:20.035 --> 33:22.496
He does have it a little harder than us

33:23.847 --> 33:27.308
because he doesn't really have
this human support

33:27.929 --> 33:29.138
that we do.

33:34.610 --> 33:38.322
Medford, Oregon

33:43.176 --> 33:45.428
The hardest thing that I've had
to really deal with in my life

33:45.429 --> 33:49.267
is just trying to convince my family
about my gaming career.

33:49.683 --> 33:52.352
It's really, really difficult especially
when you start out slow

33:52.353 --> 33:54.814
but you know there's a future for something

33:54.815 --> 33:55.908
and you put a lot of time into it,

33:55.910 --> 33:58.003
and they keep telling you,
"You should probably get a real job."

34:05.746 --> 34:10.167
I was born in the Los Angeles district
in Lancaster, California.

34:10.042 --> 34:12.043
I lived there with my dad and my mom.

34:12.699 --> 34:15.578
Around 2 years old, my dad left my mom.

34:16.710 --> 34:18.839
He didn't really say anything.
He just kind of

34:19.097 --> 34:20.168
He just packed up and left.

34:22.079 --> 34:26.752
She's had to raise us both while
going to law school at the same time.

34:28.205 --> 34:31.246
It wasn't real easy as far as
just got out of law school,

34:31.626 --> 34:35.474
didn't have a job, had huge
student loans to pay back.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.725
This job came up and so
we moved here on our own.

34:40.032 --> 34:42.576
So I've been raising them by myself
ever since.

34:44.647 --> 34:50.195
So this is a photo album
that I made for Clinton.

34:50.196 --> 34:54.152
As he was growing up, I put pictures
in it as we went along.

34:54.154 --> 34:56.572
My sons were both really active into sports

34:56.574 --> 34:58.159
and they wanted to do a lot

34:58.160 --> 34:59.662
so I had to limit them.

34:59.663 --> 35:00.759
They could choose two per season.

35:01.998 --> 35:05.377
That was maximum for me being
able to get them to practice

35:05.627 --> 35:07.086
and go watch their games.

35:07.251 --> 35:08.544
That was tough.

35:09.263 --> 35:13.267
And Clinton sitting on Santa's lap
- his brother Santa.

35:15.512 --> 35:18.426
My brother's more angry at my father
for leaving than I am.

35:18.848 --> 35:19.849
He thinks about him.

35:20.292 --> 35:21.251
He gets upset.

35:21.707 --> 35:25.795
Compared to me, I just block him out
and pretend he doesn't exist.

35:27.274 --> 35:30.528
Clinton already starting video games here.

35:32.907 --> 35:34.742
He was sitting at his house,
you know, playing Dota.

35:34.743 --> 35:37.788
Doing it competitively, had a sponsored
team and everything like that.

35:38.365 --> 35:42.068
But I think that's when it started
getting on his mom's nerves.

35:43.258 --> 35:45.136
I have a crazy sleeping schedule.

35:45.756 --> 35:49.677
I'm on a European team so sometimes I
have to stay up pretty ridiculous hours

35:49.678 --> 35:51.513
or wake up at ridiculous hours.

35:51.686 --> 35:55.064
So the standard day for me is
not so standard.

35:55.754 --> 35:58.590
All the nights he'd be up and stuff,
the dog would be up too with him

35:58.591 --> 36:01.260
and that would keep her awake
most of the nights

36:01.261 --> 36:04.765
and this is kind of where
the tension got pretty high.

36:05.225 --> 36:06.944
You know, this went on for years

36:06.945 --> 36:09.531
and it came to the point
where I just told him

36:09.532 --> 36:12.910
I said, "You know what, you just
need to go somewhere else."

36:14.483 --> 36:19.029
So I got kicked out of my house because
of my gaming career, basically.

36:23.044 --> 36:25.421
When Clinton first moved in here,

36:25.422 --> 36:29.510
he was looking for a desk and
there wasn't anything in the room.

36:29.511 --> 36:33.598
And I had a lot of stuff we were
getting ready to take to the dump.

36:33.599 --> 36:37.637
And Clinton went out there and he
came back in with this green desk.

36:37.125 --> 36:38.584
And he goes, "This is perfect!"

36:39.782 --> 36:41.868
So I didn't have a monitor,
so I went to my friend

36:41.869 --> 36:43.704
and he had a spare CRT monitor.

36:43.705 --> 36:48.043
So I got that, and then, obviously,
I have two books here to hunch that up

36:48.044 --> 36:49.545
so I can actually see the monitor.

36:49.546 --> 36:50.592
So it's kind of a ghetto setup.

36:51.239 --> 36:53.734
Even when I go to
competitions, I don't think

36:53.747 --> 36:56.035
I play any differently
on the nice setups

36:56.036 --> 36:57.705
compared to this one.

36:57.802 --> 37:00.805
Clinton's like the Rocky Balboa of Dota.

37:01.209 --> 37:04.004
He's definitely one of
the first big US players

37:04.005 --> 37:06.883
and honestly, I didn't even know
he was that big.

37:07.485 --> 37:11.947
In the North American scene, there weren't
many good American players known back then.

37:12.492 --> 37:14.119
Everybody respected Fear.

37:16.585 --> 37:19.421
A lot of the people I knew,
they quit the game.

37:19.422 --> 37:20.923
They moved on, stuff like that.

37:20.924 --> 37:24.386
But I stuck with it so I ended up
being like one of the oldest players.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.304
With all his years of experience,

37:26.305 --> 37:29.182
and all his constant commitment
to the game,

37:29.183 --> 37:31.311
he's really shown that he doesn't give up.

37:31.110 --> 37:32.361
Growing up without my father,

37:33.073 --> 37:38.594
I think in the end, not having someone
there and teach me the guy side

37:38.595 --> 37:40.430
and having a father to help you up,

37:40.035 --> 37:43.372
I think that it's actually probably made me
the person I am today.

37:44.234 --> 37:46.528
You know, I just make sure everything's
running smoothly on the team.

37:46.529 --> 37:48.990
I kind of play, like,
the father figure, I guess.

37:49.260 --> 37:52.799
As a captain, I guess he felt
he had that responsibility as well.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.122
He was like pretty much my mentor.

37:55.123 --> 37:56.359
He did tell me one time,

37:56.360 --> 37:58.779
"Hey if you need someone to talk to,"
he would be here.

37:58.780 --> 38:02.325
So I kind of see him as a Dota brother.

38:02.326 --> 38:05.167
I've never had an ego thinking that
I'm better than anyone else.

38:05.168 --> 38:08.505
I'm always there willing to help people
who are new to the scene.

38:08.772 --> 38:10.774
And that's always been kind of
my role in the game

38:10.775 --> 38:13.861
by just helping players get up
for the most part.

38:15.198 --> 38:18.410
Fear actually broke me
into the scene, you know.

38:18.069 --> 38:20.655
It's very hard to get yourself out there.

38:20.998 --> 38:24.066
I mean, back then, I was kind of
like a fan boy of him.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.505
You know, watching his games and what-not.

38:26.645 --> 38:30.441
And he gave me a shot to play
at a high level.

38:31.863 --> 38:34.282
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for Fear.

38:34.283 --> 38:36.118
I can guarantee you that.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.676
Going into the match, we were all thinking,

38:44.677 --> 38:46.744
MUFC didn't do so well earlier, but

38:47.411 --> 38:50.486
If we lost that game,
we wouldn't win anything so

38:50.487 --> 38:52.416
it was a high risk game.

38:52.417 --> 38:58.215
36 minutes in, almost a 7,000 gold
advantage in favor of MUFC

38:59.021 --> 39:00.689
Toward the end of the game,
we made a couple of mistakes

39:00.690 --> 39:02.905
that put two heroes on the sideline for us.

39:02.906 --> 39:04.922
And they had all five
still up and decided that

39:04.935 --> 39:06.961
they were going to go for
our Throne (Ancient).

39:06.125 --> 39:07.196
They're probably just going
to push for the base.

39:08.673 --> 39:10.216
They're going GG!

39:10.217 --> 39:11.586
They want to go for the GG!

39:11.587 --> 39:12.596
No Fortification anymore!

39:12.678 --> 39:14.979
We were really close to losing our Throne.

39:14.980 --> 39:17.006
It's below 20 percent HP

39:17.007 --> 39:21.999
And Online Kingdom, they are so close to
getting eliminated from this tournament!

39:22.000 --> 39:23.585
We just needed to do something.

39:23.926 --> 39:25.899
Alright, I'm going to go on them!
I'm going to initiate on them!

39:25.900 --> 39:28.038
So I ran in first and then
they all went on me

39:28.039 --> 39:30.405
instead of focusing on the Throne,
which is good.

39:30.100 --> 39:32.304
Again by Silvercross.

39:32.423 --> 39:34.466
Fear, he's trying to retreat.

39:34.467 --> 39:36.344
He turns into a pig.

39:36.470 --> 39:38.889
How the hell is he still alive?!!

39:39.597 --> 39:41.816
Go, go, go! Go, go!

39:42.028 --> 39:44.824
They push MUFC back!

39:45.049 --> 39:49.053
We made this huge comeback where
we killed all of their heroes.

39:49.198 --> 39:50.366
You know, started pushing.

39:50.367 --> 39:52.202
Silvercross is down!

39:52.050 --> 39:53.802
Morphling! He's out of this!

39:54.129 --> 39:55.630
The Top Rax (barracks) will go!

39:55.806 --> 39:58.767
There is no way now that
MUFC can come back!

39:59.600 --> 40:03.604
But it will be Online Kingdom
eliminating MUFC!

40:04.324 --> 40:06.910
Our whole team just went crazy.

40:06.911 --> 40:10.998
Fear leading Online Kingdom
to do the impossible.

40:11.468 --> 40:13.845
I've never seen anything like that.

40:13.846 --> 40:14.789
And stay tuned.

40:14.790 --> 40:18.266
We'll be back here with more
exciting gameplay coming up.

40:32.694 --> 40:33.612
Scythe.

40:33.807 --> 40:37.269
They are the 2008 ESWC winners.

40:37.379 --> 40:39.402
One of the best Asian teams

40:39.070 --> 40:40.999
but we aren't afraid of them.

40:41.036 --> 40:42.057
We're gonna fight them.

40:43.034 --> 40:44.411
I don't know about my teammates,

40:44.511 --> 40:47.347
but I don't feel scared at all.

40:48.760 --> 40:51.346
I feel like I want to crush my enemy.

40:51.749 --> 40:53.042
That's how I feel.

40:53.527 --> 40:54.445
That's it.

40:56.095 --> 40:58.138
Welcome to the Winners Bracket Final

40:58.697 --> 41:00.790
where Scythe goes up against Na'Vi.

41:01.058 --> 41:04.336
The winner gets a slot in the Grand Final.

41:05.932 --> 41:07.767
The crowds were all cheering for them.

41:07.768 --> 41:09.187
And their draft was very scary.

41:09.188 --> 41:11.231
We were, like, caught off by surprise.

41:11.662 --> 41:13.414
But, we were like,
we've gotta win this, man.

41:13.415 --> 41:14.958
We've gotta win this and
show them who's boss.

41:16.943 --> 41:19.946
Scythe has managed to take all
the best players from Singapore

41:19.947 --> 41:21.240
and put them in their lineup.

41:21.576 --> 41:22.869
One million!

41:22.881 --> 41:24.902
Na'Vi, they look cool calm and collected.

41:25.092 --> 41:26.719
They know exactly what they gotta do.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.722
It all comes down to gameplay right now

41:28.723 --> 41:31.536
and I gotta say like, Na'Vi's lineup,
it is not unbeatable.

41:33.373 --> 41:35.664
Now they're gonna look for the initiation
and possible kill.

41:35.665 --> 41:37.792
hy is gonna get caught.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.035
Now bottom lane. Held in place.

41:40.036 --> 41:42.490
Sven stunned. Sven will go down.

41:42.491 --> 41:45.558
LighTofHeaveN, he helped out but
Ancient Apparition gets the last hit.

41:46.952 --> 41:49.330
Na'Vi are dominating this final.

41:50.230 --> 41:52.483
Now Na'Vi, they're gonna
take the chance here.

41:52.079 --> 41:53.622
They're gonna go in for the GG.

41:54.028 --> 41:57.281
And GG is the call from hy first.

41:57.282 --> 41:59.534
Na'Vi are already off their computers.

41:59.535 --> 42:00.581
They're not even sticking around.

42:00.996 --> 42:02.664
They've got the GG.

42:02.665 --> 42:07.451
Na'Vi are into the Grand Finals and
will play for the one million dollars.

42:07.486 --> 42:11.450
Scythe will go down. They will face
the winner of the Loser's Bracket.

42:12.712 --> 42:15.173
We had just lost our confidence match
against Na'Vi.

42:16.225 --> 42:17.476
It was actually quite a blow to us.

42:19.241 --> 42:21.035
The game was really
the turning point for me

42:21.861 --> 42:25.824
because I actually learned that in life
you can only trust in yourself, actually

42:25.114 --> 42:27.167
not in the sense that
you can't trust people

42:27.879 --> 42:30.921
but, yeah, like I said, the one who will
never let you down is yourself.

42:37.341 --> 42:39.509
Medford, Oregon

42:41.916 --> 42:42.959
Within the gaming world

42:42.960 --> 42:46.002
You know, it's like I'm following behind
my mother's footsteps basically.

42:46.381 --> 42:48.633
She worked really hard to get where she is,

42:48.634 --> 42:49.927
and I kind of want to be the same way.

42:49.928 --> 42:51.805
I want to work hard for whatever I do.

42:53.337 --> 42:56.132
For me, I mean I've never really had a dad.

42:56.133 --> 42:59.011
So if I had any questions about anything

42:59.012 --> 43:01.514
the person I was most comfortable
talking to was my mom.

43:02.301 --> 43:04.679
She definitely had
the most influence on my life.

43:07.417 --> 43:08.960
When she comes home from work

43:08.961 --> 43:13.578
she's always anxious to bring up
the subject how she won a big case.

43:13.579 --> 43:15.600
And I'm always proud of her
when she wins these big cases

43:15.790 --> 43:17.417
because I know it means a lot to her.

43:19.153 --> 43:21.614
I mean, in the back of my head,
I'm always, like,

43:21.093 --> 43:23.137
If I do well and if I win this tournament,

43:24.011 --> 43:28.432
I'll finally be able to prove that
I'm getting something out of this.

43:32.247 --> 43:35.525
And whoever wins this match will be
facing up against EHOME,

43:35.526 --> 43:38.867
but whoever will lose it, is going
to be eliminated already.

43:38.868 --> 43:40.787
Like, EHOME, they're looking
really strong right now.

43:40.788 --> 43:43.491
We had the stronger late-game heroes,
the better team fight.

43:43.752 --> 43:46.780
Just all we had to do was just
control the pushes.

43:46.781 --> 43:48.324
Now, Online Kingdom, they're split!

43:48.325 --> 43:50.369
The stun on Santa! The splash as well.

43:50.370 --> 43:51.412
They're gonna claim a Windrunner.

43:51.413 --> 43:52.831
Will they? Yes they do!

43:52.832 --> 43:54.960
It's 2-0 for Online Kingdom.

43:54.961 --> 43:58.130
Moscow 5, not the start they wanted.

43:58.131 --> 44:00.092
But Online Kingdom having an amazing start

44:00.093 --> 44:05.106
We were so close to winning until some few
mistakes that occurred in the late game.

44:05.224 --> 44:06.433
They might go right now.

44:06.434 --> 44:08.770
There's four heroes standing
right next to each other.

44:08.771 --> 44:10.147
The timing is wrong!

44:10.672 --> 44:13.424
There's communication problems
because we're an international team.

44:13.425 --> 44:17.429
So I think full-nationality teams have
an advantage over most teams.

44:17.430 --> 44:19.599
Almost there! Big try!

44:19.600 --> 44:20.878
Fear's in trouble though.

44:20.879 --> 44:22.714
He's shackled and Lacoste is in.

44:22.715 --> 44:24.510
He casts his ulti as well.

44:24.843 --> 44:26.678
And it just fell apart from there.

44:26.977 --> 44:28.603
They just slowly beat us down.

44:28.604 --> 44:30.512
Eventually they just
broke our base and took

44:30.525 --> 44:32.316
every single one of
our raxes (barracks).

44:32.950 --> 44:35.411
This is really hurting Online Kingdom.

44:35.412 --> 44:36.579
They've lost three.

44:36.580 --> 44:37.832
Enigma pops.

44:37.833 --> 44:40.627
The team is wiped for Online Kingdom.

44:40.628 --> 44:43.737
The base will be taken
and Moscow 5 will now

44:43.750 --> 44:46.662
play EHOME and advance
in the tournament.

44:46.969 --> 44:51.332
Now, Online Kingdom, they are out.
So much promise

44:51.333 --> 44:54.898
It didn't happen in the end for Fear
and the rest of Online Kingdom,

44:55.057 --> 44:58.351
and it will be Moscow 5 that will advance.

45:01.128 --> 45:04.756
I think everybody on the team
was very emotional.

45:07.186 --> 45:09.855
I could only imagine how he was feeling.

45:11.839 --> 45:15.718
Some people take it more personally
and they give everything to win.

45:16.631 --> 45:20.427
It was very satisfying knowing
that we reached that Top 8,

45:20.428 --> 45:23.664
but he had better expectations
for our team,

45:23.665 --> 45:25.757
and we'd come a long way
and it's all thanks to Fear.

45:27.130 --> 45:31.677
If you don't go as far as you
thought you were going to be,

45:33.265 --> 45:35.851
I guess you end up in tears or something.

45:42.288 --> 45:44.334
All of us are really disappointed, but

45:44.749 --> 45:46.418
I guess that's just how it goes.

45:48.790 --> 45:52.294
When I get back home, I need to
make a big decision in my life.

45:52.295 --> 45:54.631
Like, just the benefits of
playing Dota professionally,

45:54.632 --> 45:55.799
how much I can make from it,

45:56.620 --> 46:00.416
and how much time I really need to put
into it to be one hundred percent, so

46:00.075 --> 46:03.787
The only way I would ever do that is if
I move in with my teammates

46:04.130 --> 46:05.632
and have like a training house with them

46:05.852 --> 46:07.979
so I know for sure that
we're all dedicated.

46:09.320 --> 46:11.572
I think things happen for a reason,

46:11.573 --> 46:13.950
and when things happen,
you just do your best,

46:13.951 --> 46:15.912
and continue going forward with it.

46:16.639 --> 46:19.189
I mean, deep down inside,
I know this career

46:19.202 --> 46:21.478
is going to work out
for me in the end.

46:25.502 --> 46:27.403
As for the Chinese teams I
hope and know that they're

46:27.416 --> 46:29.010
capable of coming out
of the Losers Bracket.

46:29.011 --> 46:35.226
The top three teams are likely to be
Na'Vi, Scythe, and a Chinese team

46:35.227 --> 46:38.105
which I personally hope will be EHOME.

46:38.661 --> 46:44.875
Emotionally, I would hope
that EHOME would win.

46:44.876 --> 46:45.877
Turning him into a pig!

46:45.122 --> 46:46.456
They need to get this kill.

46:47.213 --> 46:50.341
The stun! The Weaver Wave!
It's a little piglet!

46:50.342 --> 46:52.261
And it's dead! Slardar!

46:52.262 --> 46:54.389
820, he's almost dead!

46:54.390 --> 46:57.018
Burrow Strike! Epicenter!

46:57.019 --> 47:01.023
357! It's a double-kill by the Weaver!

47:01.024 --> 47:04.152
EHOME, they'll lose FCB as well.

47:04.153 --> 47:07.170
Moscow 5, casualties of war.

47:07.497 --> 47:10.083
Holy Hell.

47:10.279 --> 47:13.263
In China, this game is
a professional career.

47:13.594 --> 47:15.221
We are stressed because we have to win.

47:15.222 --> 47:19.726
If we don't win or we lose
to foreign teams,

47:19.727 --> 47:22.395
Chinese fans will have doubt in us.

47:23.090 --> 47:25.134
Now Lion though is going to find him.
Hexes him up.

47:25.135 --> 47:26.636
Finger's already started. There's the stun.

47:26.637 --> 47:27.658
Maelk in a lot of trouble.

47:27.119 --> 47:27.911
Really caught out of position.

47:28.641 --> 47:30.435
AA ulti will fly in but hits on nothing.

47:30.436 --> 47:32.062
Mania with the SK ultimate

47:32.063 --> 47:33.815
The situation is China against the world.

47:36.232 --> 47:38.651
If we win the championship,
it is what we are supposed to do.

47:38.652 --> 47:42.272
I tell them, if you are coming here,
you are here for the first place.

47:42.273 --> 47:46.986
I will tell them every day, we must
accomplish this. We must achieve this.

47:48.543 --> 47:49.717
Our tradition is

47:49.718 --> 47:51.720
anything other than the champion trophy
we will not bring home.

47:51.721 --> 47:54.339
They will go ahead
and trash it at the airport.

47:54.558 --> 47:57.311
Now PLT. Support Teleporting in.
FCB gets the first stun.

47:57.547 --> 47:59.548
Misery over-commits on the top lane.

48:08.644 --> 48:10.437
GG!

48:11.395 --> 48:16.734
I can feel they really want to beat us,
the foreign teams.

48:17.384 --> 48:18.301
PLT, he's had enough of this.

48:18.532 --> 48:21.619
FCB! What a time for a Frog!

48:21.676 --> 48:23.135
Misery will pop!

48:25.310 --> 48:28.897
But when they watch us play, they feel

48:30.258 --> 48:31.304
that there is no way to beat us.

48:41.565 --> 48:44.526
Singapore

48:44.858 --> 48:46.401
This is where my dad works.

48:46.785 --> 48:47.786
For as long as I remember,

48:48.656 --> 48:51.201
he's doing the logistics
for the company here.

48:51.586 --> 48:56.591
So it involves the shipping of the
containers from one place to another.

48:58.572 --> 49:02.327
When I was younger, he used to work, like,
15 to 16 hours a day.

49:03.517 --> 49:06.145
He's pretty much given up
on everything else in his life.

49:09.546 --> 49:11.199
He's always made it
clear to me that I

49:11.212 --> 49:13.133
should focus on my life,
focus on my studies

49:13.134 --> 49:15.136
so as to not follow in his footsteps.

49:15.107 --> 49:19.419
He doesn't want me to be slogging
as hard as he is right now.

49:22.421 --> 49:26.898
But the chance to be the best
in the world at something

49:26.899 --> 49:28.150
you don't get it much in life.

49:42.759 --> 49:45.178
I heard my son say

49:45.272 --> 49:47.816
he's working at this, what, Dota.

49:48.355 --> 49:53.366
He spends a lot of time and he gets
nothing. For me, it's very disappointing.

49:54.052 --> 49:56.387
Never goes to school.
He wants to play computer.

49:56.388 --> 50:01.435
Then in the morning, sleep. Then computer
until the next day morning. Then he sleeps.

50:01.436 --> 50:04.478
The whole day at least 15 hours
at the computer a day.

50:04.989 --> 50:09.952
His life, my son's life is like that.

50:10.581 --> 50:16.898
For me, I hope for my son to study more.
Not like me. I never studied.

50:16.899 --> 50:19.383
When I was young, I was
also the same as Han

50:19.396 --> 50:22.001
Yong (hy), always spent
a lot of time to play.

50:22.002 --> 50:24.343
But now I also regret, why I don't study.

50:24.344 --> 50:26.430
But now I'm hoping my son
continues to study

50:26.080 --> 50:27.581
to get an education better than me.

50:29.974 --> 50:31.045
This is my hope.

50:34.048 --> 50:36.620
Having reached the final day
of the tournament,

50:36.709 --> 50:40.083
Benedict has missed two exams and
must repeat his last semester of school.

50:40.084 --> 50:43.635
His team is one win away
from the Grand Finals.

50:44.216 --> 50:46.552
I want to win this badly.

50:47.366 --> 50:49.618
Are you ready for EHOME?

50:51.978 --> 50:54.064
We'll do whatever we can.

50:54.939 --> 50:57.775
For hy, I feel it was a great choice
- a brilliant choice.

50:57.944 --> 50:59.570
Because he was considering
that we could have won.

51:00.585 --> 51:02.606
It's an opportunity that
you shouldn't miss out.

51:03.458 --> 51:07.420
So, get ready, sign in, log in,
play around, test a little bit,

51:07.079 --> 51:09.248
and then join the lobby in about 4 minutes.

51:11.775 --> 51:13.318
It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

51:14.732 --> 51:17.485
If you miss it, it might be gone forever.
You might not experience it again.

51:18.094 --> 51:20.112
And we have a rematch.

51:20.239 --> 51:21.866
EHOME versus Scythe.

51:21.867 --> 51:23.702
EHOME facing up against the team
that forced them into the lower bracket.

51:25.706 --> 51:30.252
The psychological pressure is immense,
especially upon the drafter.

51:30.590 --> 51:35.428
Because he is the one who is in the end
responsible for the team's picks.

51:41.087 --> 51:42.185
No, no, no, no, no.

51:42.186 --> 51:43.661
No, no. Don't say no!

51:43.104 --> 51:44.201
No, no. Trust me. No.

51:46.121 --> 51:46.854
Wait, wait, wait.

51:47.566 --> 51:49.192
Tell me this. You really want it?

51:49.193 --> 51:50.194
I really think

51:50.195 --> 51:53.673
It's the Antimage and SF (Shadow Fiend).

51:53.674 --> 51:54.675
That's what I think.

51:55.154 --> 52:00.493
Shadow Fiend? Alrighty then.
It's hyhy as SF.

52:00.494 --> 52:02.746
Everyone knows how to
counter a Shadow Fiend.

52:02.747 --> 52:05.875
It's a very bold pickup here by Scythe.

52:05.876 --> 52:10.214
The fact, if Scythe wins the early game,
they're going to gain so much momentum,

52:10.215 --> 52:12.419
but if they don't, then
EHOME will basically

52:12.432 --> 52:14.303
roll themselves into
the Grand Final.

52:15.606 --> 52:17.785
hyhy, BKB (Black King Bar) is going
to wear off pretty soon,

52:17.786 --> 52:19.329
Venomancer, great strike!

52:19.330 --> 52:20.331
hy's dead!

52:20.637 --> 52:23.336
Stay in the trees now!

52:23.337 --> 52:24.426
And he wants xy-, he catches up to him.

52:25.228 --> 52:26.312
And he brings him down.

52:26.459 --> 52:29.124
Hey! I told you to stay in the trees!

52:29.785 --> 52:31.078
Why'd you come out?

52:33.091 --> 52:35.950
Stay in the trees! I told you.

52:36.077 --> 52:37.829
What an ulti! He Cogs!

52:38.613 --> 52:41.949
Chawy, he wants to leap,
but there is just no Mana!

52:42.443 --> 52:43.532
I already told you.

52:50.625 --> 52:51.876
I told you. Do you understand?

52:51.877 --> 52:53.321
It's ok. Take it easy.

52:53.070 --> 52:54.855
If he can pop off an ulti
like that, he doesn't

52:54.868 --> 52:56.364
have to reveal himself
to his opponent.

52:56.617 --> 52:58.287
He can really just initiate.

52:58.288 --> 53:00.552
Oh, there he goes! hyhy doesn't manage
to pop off an ultimate.

53:00.094 --> 53:00.861
Nice!

53:02.855 --> 53:03.876
Nice!

53:06.174 --> 53:07.776
There are already three gone.

53:07.777 --> 53:08.611
Make that four.

53:08.612 --> 53:09.683
It's a double-kill for the Anti-mage.

53:10.071 --> 53:11.142
And they're headed for the tower right now.

53:12.034 --> 53:16.372
There is a GG Good Game called by hyhy.

53:16.076 --> 53:17.133
Scythe have had enough now.

53:17.944 --> 53:19.278
EHOME will advance.

53:19.279 --> 53:21.211
The Chinese hopes will stay alive

53:21.212 --> 53:25.557
as they will go up against Na'Vi
with a one game disadvantage.

53:46.922 --> 53:48.594
The first-placing was very important to me.

53:49.909 --> 53:54.247
And to add on to that, my studies were also
at the same time affected by everything.

53:54.248 --> 53:55.810
So everything was related.

53:56.115 --> 53:58.534
When everything comes falling down
at the same time

53:59.932 --> 54:01.760
it's quite hard to handle.

54:03.320 --> 54:04.238
Things are all changed.

54:05.015 --> 54:06.111
So you gotta plan your life again.

54:06.976 --> 54:07.727
All over again.

54:10.050 --> 54:11.259
I've learned a lot.

54:12.047 --> 54:13.674
You've gotta realize your flaws.

54:14.418 --> 54:15.586
That's the toughest part, I feel.

54:16.647 --> 54:18.441
I don't do things as well alone.

54:18.568 --> 54:20.779
So if you try to do everything by yourself,

54:20.780 --> 54:22.406
it's not going to be possible, you know.

54:23.436 --> 54:25.438
I'm actually a believer of fate, and

54:25.439 --> 54:27.942
I told myself that winning isn't necessary

54:27.943 --> 54:29.695
because there are so many
more things in life.

54:30.118 --> 54:31.745
How you take care of the people you love.

54:33.565 --> 54:36.360
I think that's a very big thing.
That's a very important thing.

54:37.773 --> 54:40.275
It's the most important thing ever.

54:46.381 --> 54:47.382
Catch these guys.

54:48.448 --> 54:49.366
It's not fair.

54:49.851 --> 54:50.862
Catch these guys.

54:51.332 --> 54:53.175
I just woke up. It's not fair.

54:55.136 --> 54:56.929
My haircut

54:56.930 --> 54:58.056
still

54:58.057 --> 54:58.725
crazy.

54:58.726 --> 54:59.351
No?

55:00.915 --> 55:02.000
But I don't care.

55:02.583 --> 55:04.126
Ok, I have everything with me.

55:05.037 --> 55:06.163
Let's go.

55:08.700 --> 55:10.694
We are now at the final day

55:10.695 --> 55:13.323
of The International Dota 2 Championships.

55:13.072 --> 55:14.073
It is Na'Vi.

55:14.326 --> 55:15.452
They have a one game advantage.

55:15.453 --> 55:18.748
Sitting very, very sweetly
in the Grand Final.

55:18.749 --> 55:22.086
Who will get a shot
at the one million dollars?

55:22.836 --> 55:25.719
Na'Vi was running the same strategy
the whole time

55:25.720 --> 55:27.847
and no one seemed to be able to counter it.

55:28.627 --> 55:31.505
Na'Vi loves pushing from minute 10

55:31.506 --> 55:32.602
and trying to end the game at minute 15.

55:34.092 --> 55:36.219
Those strategies are very sensitive

55:36.220 --> 55:37.806
because if you fail even once

55:37.807 --> 55:40.352
it can become a very
difficult game for you.

55:40.693 --> 55:43.821
EHOME has been known for how well
they defend their base

55:43.822 --> 55:46.889
So if there was a team that could stop
Na'Vi's push it would be EHOME.

55:47.717 --> 55:48.763
And let's get this game underway.

55:49.178 --> 55:50.274
The players will start to
pick up their heroes

55:51.139 --> 55:53.058
with one million dollars at stake.

55:53.534 --> 55:54.605
Na'Vi need to win two.

55:55.122 --> 55:56.999
EHOME need to win three.

56:01.694 --> 56:06.573
Running a very, very old school strategy
with three core heroes.

56:06.574 --> 56:09.703
EHOME managed to survive
Na'Vi's onslaught early.

56:09.906 --> 56:11.158
It's all on Dendi.

56:11.159 --> 56:12.785
PLT TP's himself in.

56:12.786 --> 56:14.464
Dendi on the retreat back out to the tower.

56:14.087 --> 56:15.380
Will he get himself away?

56:15.759 --> 56:16.677
X!! Yes, there it is.

56:16.678 --> 56:20.835
Last hit, 357, the Venomancer
brings down Dendi in the middle.

56:21.868 --> 56:24.659
Every time you see Dendi perform
he's always playing very well

56:24.660 --> 56:26.552
and he usually doesn't lose his lanes.

56:26.553 --> 56:29.107
So, Dendi, his impatience is that

56:29.108 --> 56:31.319
Chinese teams, they are patient.

56:31.320 --> 56:35.574
They look out for the fact that
you might cross a line

56:35.098 --> 56:38.602
and they will take you and kill you
and win the game through those situations.

56:39.333 --> 56:41.582
Trouble in the mid lane again.
There's already the Gush.

56:41.583 --> 56:44.628
357, PLT, everyone is right
on top of Dendi.

56:44.629 --> 56:45.675
He's in the wrong place.

56:46.090 --> 56:49.378
And the way Na'Vi played,
they really gambled basically.

56:51.590 --> 56:53.759
Dendi's really been ganked, just shut down.

56:53.760 --> 56:56.388
And not a single kill to his name as well.

56:56.970 --> 56:59.848
Now Na'Vi going to assault inside the base

56:59.849 --> 57:02.425
Watch Artstyle. Tier 3 tower. VS Swap!

57:02.084 --> 57:03.252
Artstyle's in the wrong place!

57:03.595 --> 57:05.354
Doom there as well!
BKB's both popping off!

57:05.355 --> 57:07.744
Ravage will pop from LighTofHeaveN
unable to affect EHOME.

57:07.745 --> 57:08.964
Pudge will go down.

57:08.965 --> 57:09.924
They want to be initiated on.

57:09.925 --> 57:12.684
Na'Vi, they need to fall back.

57:12.685 --> 57:14.690
They take your little upsets

57:14.115 --> 57:16.617
and just win the game
through those mistakes.

57:17.945 --> 57:19.922
"GG" from Na'Vi!

57:20.090 --> 57:25.608
EHOME are celebrating right now
inside the booth. Na'Vi cannot believe it!

57:26.215 --> 57:28.651
They've dominated this
tournament up till now,

57:28.664 --> 57:31.215
and EHOME takes the first
match so convincingly.

57:31.089 --> 57:33.883
That was the first loss of Na'Vi
during the whole tournament.

57:34.271 --> 57:36.607
They went undefeated until the Grand Final.

57:36.608 --> 57:39.669
We're going to have a 15-minute break
and be right back here soon.

57:39.670 --> 57:42.464
Na'Vi, they need to compose themselves.

57:42.619 --> 57:45.455
EHOME, well, they just need to be awesome

57:45.087 --> 57:46.820
What a play by them!

57:47.113 --> 57:49.349
Any loss actually makes me pretty sad.

58:00.904 --> 58:02.572
Dendi's Home

58:02.573 --> 58:04.784
L'viv, Ukraine

58:04.785 --> 58:08.038
We tried to put family pictures here.

58:09.178 --> 58:11.139
This is our mom and dad.

58:11.140 --> 58:14.601
And I think that this one
is our favorite actually.

58:17.944 --> 58:21.031
My childhood, we lived a poor life

58:21.032 --> 58:25.161
and Dad was working for all our lives.

58:26.219 --> 58:29.222
But he helped us every time
and every problem.

58:31.100 --> 58:33.018
I just ask him and he'll do everything

58:33.019 --> 58:35.655
for me, for Katya, for Danil as well.

58:37.333 --> 58:41.212
But Danil and Father were like friends.

58:42.294 --> 58:44.213
Indeed my husband was

58:44.585 --> 58:46.462
simply a fanatical fisherman.

58:46.926 --> 58:53.975
Danil was, I would say, his best student.

58:54.462 --> 59:00.986
Danil has the same patience
and control as his dad.

59:00.141 --> 59:04.945
He could sit for hours and watch the bobber

59:05.792 --> 59:07.669
that wouldn't even twitch.

59:09.359 --> 59:12.654
They could sit with no speaking for hours.

59:12.655 --> 59:15.449
And just enjoy each other's company.

59:15.825 --> 59:18.452
They understood each other without words.

59:21.746 --> 59:25.082
One day I was going fishing, but

59:25.083 --> 59:27.711
Dad never showed up.

59:27.712 --> 59:29.800
When I came home it was already super late.

59:31.019 --> 59:33.605
He was feeling bad.

59:33.606 --> 59:37.694
He went to the hospital. He decided to

59:38.531 --> 59:43.544
stay for a few weeks, you know,
so we watch everything, stuff like this.

59:44.264 --> 59:45.632
And

59:46.267 --> 59:46.363
cancer.

59:50.297 --> 59:52.258
It was a very big shock for me

59:52.259 --> 59:54.135
because he was very thin.

59:54.096 --> 59:56.163
I cannot understand that this is my father.

59:57.696 --> 01:00:00.490
We were all sure that it must be okay.

01:00:01.001 --> 01:00:04.129
But it was a very short time.

01:00:05.861 --> 01:00:08.113
I was really sad and was

01:00:08.456 --> 01:00:11.251
crying a lot.

01:00:11.252 --> 01:00:12.621
I was upset about

01:00:12.622 --> 01:00:17.251
I couldn't say to him, many times,
how much I loved him.

01:00:20.021 --> 01:00:23.649
After his dad passed away,

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:25.611
he hasn't gone fishing once.

01:00:25.144 --> 01:00:26.687
Not even once.

01:00:27.552 --> 01:00:32.561
For now this is all in the past.

01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:38.624
Actually I spent more time near
the computer because

01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:40.656
I could not think about it.

01:00:41.065 --> 01:00:42.942
It's like a distractor.

01:00:43.096 --> 01:00:45.223
It was like a start time, actually.

01:00:45.483 --> 01:00:47.818
The push to play more.

01:00:48.601 --> 01:00:51.604
And that's maybe one of the reasons
why I'm playing now.

01:00:52.266 --> 01:00:53.893
Maybe I wouldn't play at all.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:59.679
The relationship of Danil and my mom
grew stronger these days.

01:01:00.001 --> 01:01:01.836
They support each other.

01:01:02.213 --> 01:01:04.590
and they are very good friends.

01:01:04.591 --> 01:01:07.553
I think that this is very important
for Danil.

01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:11.794
You know, five years ago,
I wouldn't care about many things.

01:01:13.183 --> 01:01:15.686
Now, I'm thinking about it a lot.

01:01:16.988 --> 01:01:19.240
Something knocks you down,

01:01:19.241 --> 01:01:20.909
you need to learn to get up.

01:01:21.074 --> 01:01:24.870
So I'm trying to research this.

01:01:27.896 --> 01:01:29.355
To learn to get up.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.609
This is the most important moment
in my life

01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:37.655
because everything I worked on
wasn't useful.

01:01:37.867 --> 01:01:42.831
And now I have a chance to win
this tournament for my family.

01:01:44.610 --> 01:01:48.646
So we have currently EHOME and Na'Vi
playing the Grand Finals.

01:01:49.411 --> 01:01:51.872
Na'Vi just lost one game versus EHOME

01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:52.818
and it's 1-1.

01:01:52.126 --> 01:01:56.908
So both teams have to win two matches
in order to win the one million dollars.

01:01:59.158 --> 01:02:02.286
Because our picks looked completely
different, we were like passive and stuff.

01:02:02.287 --> 01:02:04.085
People thought we lost the first game,

01:02:04.086 --> 01:02:05.295
we're going to lose the second game.

01:02:05.664 --> 01:02:07.833
We were maybe a little bit demoralized.

01:02:07.834 --> 01:02:11.003
We really needed to change
to a different pick.

01:02:11.004 --> 01:02:12.381
We were missing something.

01:02:12.782 --> 01:02:14.149
We picked Enigma just

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:16.009
to have a strong teamfight

01:02:15.146 --> 01:02:16.974
a five versus five combat.

01:02:20.352 --> 01:02:21.770
It was, like, the last hero left

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:23.565
and I never played it before.

01:02:24.089 --> 01:02:26.508
Then, we're, like, "Dendi, you go!"

01:02:26.711 --> 01:02:29.103
And he's, like,
"Guys, I've never played it!"

01:02:29.104 --> 01:02:30.481
"But, I can do it!"

01:02:31.137 --> 01:02:32.685
So we took the risk of taking him

01:02:32.686 --> 01:02:35.147
and risking maybe playing him badly.

01:02:35.477 --> 01:02:39.022
So it looks like down on that bottom lane,
Dendi will be taking the Enigma.

01:02:39.023 --> 01:02:41.567
It is going to be a very, very rough lane

01:02:41.745 --> 01:02:42.773
Na'Vi lost the game.

01:02:42.774 --> 01:02:44.838
And they're playing something now
that they're not as confident with.

01:02:45.415 --> 01:02:48.086
EHOME figured out Na'Vi.
Figured out how to play against it.

01:02:48.087 --> 01:02:51.058
And I'm going to stick to my word
and I'm going to say EHOME will win it.

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:53.640
It was incredibly ballsy from Dendi
to do that

01:02:53.641 --> 01:02:56.978
on the verge of winning the million dollars
for your team.

01:02:57.651 --> 01:03:06.065
That's very, very stupid. That's suicidal.

01:03:07.092 --> 01:03:08.174
Dendi really now caught out.

01:03:08.913 --> 01:03:09.831
He's in trouble.

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:10.904
Rockets to fly in.

01:03:10.905 --> 01:03:13.783
FCB long way in on the tower,
lands the stun.

01:03:13.784 --> 01:03:15.536
Tinker just lasers him to death.

01:03:15.537 --> 01:03:17.300
It will cost FCB his life.

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:19.537
Then we made some little mistakes.

01:03:19.538 --> 01:03:22.693
We played a really semi type of, like,
"turtle" strategy.

01:03:22.694 --> 01:03:24.145
Really passive. Really passive.

01:03:24.146 --> 01:03:25.217
We don't play like that.

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:26.257
Puppey and Dendi just want
to retreat back out.

01:03:26.609 --> 01:03:29.112
820! What a Fissure!

01:03:29.113 --> 01:03:30.322
PLT is there!

01:03:30.323 --> 01:03:31.741
Echo Slam as well!

01:03:31.742 --> 01:03:33.898
Beautiful play there by EHOME.

01:03:34.159 --> 01:03:36.106
But I know if I die,

01:03:36.107 --> 01:03:37.692
I die not for nothing.

01:03:38.038 --> 01:03:38.997
X!! in the middle lane

01:03:38.998 --> 01:03:40.917
Force, Rocket, Laser.

01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:42.044
It's enough!

01:03:42.045 --> 01:03:44.089
Dendi goes down in the middle lane.

01:03:45.715 --> 01:03:48.051
Sometimes it can be like, you dying

01:03:48.052 --> 01:03:50.221
but your teammates picking up more.

01:03:50.097 --> 01:03:51.168
EHOME, they still want
to push out that mid

01:03:52.222 --> 01:03:54.766
They weren't ready for Dendi Enigma.

01:03:54.767 --> 01:03:56.694
It was a patient Enigma.

01:03:56.695 --> 01:03:58.386
That was the most patient
Enigma in the world.

01:03:58.387 --> 01:03:59.153
Puppey is here.

01:03:59.154 --> 01:03:59.247
Dendi as well.

01:03:59.885 --> 01:04:01.408
Going to look for the Hole.

01:04:01.443 --> 01:04:03.140
BLACK HOLE!!!!

01:04:05.128 --> 01:04:07.300
Three are going to go down for EHOME

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:10.043
Currently, Na'Vi, they have
the advantage now.

01:04:10.269 --> 01:04:13.401
That really impresses me
how he's able to make that transition.

01:04:13.402 --> 01:04:15.343
You just have to have the balls, basically.

01:04:15.575 --> 01:04:16.826
He was scared of losing.

01:04:16.827 --> 01:04:19.163
That's why he was so patient
and he did everything right.

01:04:20.217 --> 01:04:23.220
Their strategy is kind of similar
to how EHOME won.

01:04:24.073 --> 01:04:26.117
Na'Vi defeated them "Late Game."

01:04:26.118 --> 01:04:28.210
And I think this really shattered
EHOME's confidence.

01:04:29.844 --> 01:04:32.221
And "GG" is the call from EHOME.

01:04:32.222 --> 01:04:34.391
Na'Vi, they take the game.

01:04:34.392 --> 01:04:38.730
And they are only one win short
of taking home one million dollars.

01:04:41.074 --> 01:04:43.577
We hardly won the second game.

01:04:43.146 --> 01:04:45.238
Chinese teams generally are feared
for their "Late Game" potential.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:48.143
So we hit the point now.

01:04:48.144 --> 01:04:49.183
The gloves come off.

01:04:49.184 --> 01:04:54.445
EHOME, they will master their knowledge,
their experience, their calls

01:04:54.616 --> 01:04:56.675
up against Na'Vi.

01:04:56.719 --> 01:04:58.857
And Puck will be the last hero for Na'Vi.

01:04:58.858 --> 01:05:00.777
The nimble hero there already.

01:05:00.778 --> 01:05:02.781
Once again a lot of aggressive heroes
for themselves.

01:05:03.079 --> 01:05:05.741
Na'Vi LighTofHeaveN playing
as the Beastmaster again

01:05:05.121 --> 01:05:06.956
with Dendi playing as the Puck this time.

01:05:08.086 --> 01:05:09.824
If Na'Vi wins this,

01:05:09.825 --> 01:05:12.114
they win the whole tournament.

01:05:12.478 --> 01:05:14.897
This Clash of the Titans right here

01:05:14.898 --> 01:05:15.969
is something we will not want to miss.

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:17.921
X!! will come in closer.

01:05:18.336 --> 01:05:19.545
They will be able to get that kill.

01:05:19.765 --> 01:05:20.786
Doom now on Dendi.

01:05:20.976 --> 01:05:25.367
Pulled in by X!!
The entire EHOME team turns on him.

01:05:25.515 --> 01:05:27.252
Lich will go down.

01:05:27.253 --> 01:05:28.279
FCB is on the run.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.048
XBOCT after the chase of him.

01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:31.425
Might be enough. Needs some more damage.

01:05:31.426 --> 01:05:33.493
Storm! X!! Long jump in.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:35.515
Dendi Orbing up to the high ground.

01:05:35.516 --> 01:05:37.601
FCB! Puts on the Rift.

01:05:37.107 --> 01:05:38.776
Will he be able to get the kill?
He's on the retreat.

01:05:39.074 --> 01:05:40.700
Yes, it is.
Dendi with the last right click.

01:05:41.165 --> 01:05:43.459
EHOME now, they're gonna
rotate themselves down.

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.045
Na'Vi already in the pit.

01:05:45.046 --> 01:05:47.715
They're trying to bring down Roshan
- all 5.

01:05:47.716 --> 01:05:48.787
Dendi! He's gonna jump out!

01:05:49.427 --> 01:05:51.179
He goes for the Dream Coil! He gets them!

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.933
He gets EHOME!
Holds them in the middle lane.

01:05:53.934 --> 01:05:56.186
Na'Vi already on their way out of the pit.

01:05:56.187 --> 01:05:58.272
They're coming in to help out Dendi.

01:05:58.273 --> 01:06:01.235
Then we just went in and demolished them.

01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:05.412
Now they're on top of the Tier 3 tower.

01:06:05.413 --> 01:06:08.925
They're going to bring it down.
Yes, it does go down.

01:06:08.926 --> 01:06:11.632
EHOME, they're trying desperately to defend

01:06:11.633 --> 01:06:14.107
but Na'Vi, the onslaught will continue.

01:06:14.108 --> 01:06:15.945
The mid tower's already being pushed.

01:06:15.946 --> 01:06:17.883
The Tier 4 tower is going to go down.

01:06:17.884 --> 01:06:20.472
And running in right now
is the rest of Na'Vi.

01:06:20.095 --> 01:06:22.461
They are running forward
to one million dollars.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.037
And they will get it!

01:06:24.038 --> 01:06:26.583
The "GG" is the call from EHOME.

01:06:26.646 --> 01:06:31.065
Na'Vi have just won one million dollars.

01:06:31.376 --> 01:06:36.131
EHOME do take home $250,000
in second place.

01:06:36.132 --> 01:06:38.844
But Na'Vi are the champions!

01:06:40.522 --> 01:06:42.858
There's moments of E Sports
that are landmark,

01:06:42.859 --> 01:06:45.187
and this is one of them. In Cologne.

01:06:45.188 --> 01:06:47.232
And Na'Vi, the winners.

01:06:47.071 --> 01:06:49.406
You guys have just made history.

01:06:58.974 --> 01:07:01.287
I was jumping on the sofa.

01:07:01.288 --> 01:07:04.750
And screaming like a crazy girl

01:07:05.197 --> 01:07:07.283
because I was the happiest
girl in the world.

01:07:07.284 --> 01:07:10.536
And my brother just won
one million dollars!

01:07:20.421 --> 01:07:21.798
I think in 10 years time

01:07:21.799 --> 01:07:24.726
all the gamers which we currently have
showing themselves,

01:07:25.055 --> 01:07:26.890
they're going to be the guys
we will look back at and say

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:27.868
this was the beginning.

01:07:27.869 --> 01:07:28.890
This is where it all started.

01:07:29.558 --> 01:07:31.226
These are the guys that worked hard

01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:32.870
and they took the risk.

01:07:33.117 --> 01:07:34.767
They proved themselves.

01:07:35.821 --> 01:07:38.198
And they forwarded the entire industry
to the point where

01:07:38.199 --> 01:07:39.283
we could have a kick-start.

01:07:39.077 --> 01:07:40.871
We could show the world what we do.

01:07:41.415 --> 01:07:44.668
And then who knows how big
we could get at that point.

01:07:47.061 --> 01:07:48.979
We've come far already.

01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:50.888
When more and more people support it

01:07:50.889 --> 01:07:52.387
and it becomes more and more normal,

01:07:52.388 --> 01:07:56.696
it's going to go from a niche
to becoming accepted in societies.

01:07:57.408 --> 01:08:00.995
I think in 15 years,
E Sports will be bigger than football.

01:08:01.319 --> 01:08:02.654
Than basketball. Than everything.

01:08:03.087 --> 01:08:06.238
That kid who you thought played
too many video games

01:08:06.239 --> 01:08:08.700
is potentially going to be on a path

01:08:08.701 --> 01:08:13.190
where he's earning $250,000 a year, salary.

01:08:13.191 --> 01:08:14.609
He's flying the world.

01:08:14.610 --> 01:08:16.404
He's going to be endorsed.

01:08:16.893 --> 01:08:19.645
Gaming's the biggest entertainment
industry in the world.

01:08:19.897 --> 01:08:20.968
So if you're a star,

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:24.946
you are potentially one of
the biggest stars in the world.

01:08:25.774 --> 01:08:29.819
So, if that, like everything else with
computers grows exponentially or whatever

01:08:29.821 --> 01:08:32.532
then 5 or 10 years could be
a big step actually.

01:08:33.171 --> 01:08:35.006
Changing mindsets is never easy.

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:36.348
So it's going to take awhile.

01:08:36.988 --> 01:08:39.866
When the gamers now become parents,

01:08:40.055 --> 01:08:42.644
we will be supportive of our kids playing,

01:08:42.122 --> 01:08:45.376
and I think that's really when
everything will boom.

01:08:52.957 --> 01:08:56.192
"The only thing achieved in life
without effort is failure"

01:08:59.683 --> 01:09:01.184
After weeks of training,

01:09:01.068 --> 01:09:04.654
a local man has led his
online gaming team to the top,

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:08.277
placing seventh in an international
gaming competition held in Germany.

01:09:09.473 --> 01:09:10.557
Yeah, she's definitely proud of me.

01:09:10.558 --> 01:09:12.151
I mean just, she had her camera out

01:09:12.152 --> 01:09:15.697
like, "Why are taking a photo
of the television?"

01:09:16.894 --> 01:09:19.522
I know she's really smart.
She's a lawyer as well.

01:09:20.072 --> 01:09:22.658
But in the end, I think
she'll be more understanding

01:09:22.736 --> 01:09:24.488
and be willing to support me more

01:09:24.488 --> 01:09:26.073
so it worked out.

01:09:36.462 --> 01:09:37.808
We were disappointed with our loss.

01:09:38.225 --> 01:09:40.133
And, yeah, it's a mixture of both,

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:41.551
we're happy and sad that we got third.

01:09:42.219 --> 01:09:43.220
Because of all the emotions

01:09:43.238 --> 01:09:45.407
I felt like she was the one
I wanted to share them with.

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:47.816
And it got pretty clear only then
that I had to get her back.

01:09:48.037 --> 01:09:50.706
After the tournament I actually
went back to look for her,

01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:52.399
and talk things out,

01:09:52.401 --> 01:09:54.493
and we have actually begun dating again.

01:09:55.727 --> 01:09:57.688
And things are actually going great.

01:10:00.098 --> 01:10:01.265
I love her, you know.

01:10:04.138 --> 01:10:06.974
She played a huge role, a very huge part

01:10:07.972 --> 01:10:09.099
in

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:10.309
in the me today.

01:10:16.975 --> 01:10:19.971
One week ago it was 3,000 followers.

01:10:20.037 --> 01:10:21.128
I was happy.

01:10:21.702 --> 01:10:24.008
Then it's boomed. 8,000 followers.

01:10:24.619 --> 01:10:25.886
It's not about the number.

01:10:26.548 --> 01:10:28.798
Even if it's one or two, I'm fine.

01:10:29.681 --> 01:10:32.532
So you don't need to show numbers actually.

01:10:32.997 --> 01:10:34.263
I think.

01:10:34.757 --> 01:10:37.199
My father, I think,

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:41.559
didn't have time to understand
what Dendi's doing.

01:10:46.093 --> 01:10:48.367
We lost him too early.

01:10:49.505 --> 01:10:51.583
And if now he could see Dendi,

01:10:52.079 --> 01:10:55.126
I'm sure that he's proud of his son.
