00:03.300 --> 00:04.734
<i>Remember at the end
of Star Wars?</i>

00:04.768 --> 00:06.102
They're about
to blow up the Death Star,

00:06.136 --> 00:09.405
And they show the guys
in those badass X-Wing Fighters.

00:09.439 --> 00:12.108
They got red two,
Wedge Antilles.

00:12.142 --> 00:13.409
They got Luke,

00:13.443 --> 00:16.111
And then they cut
to a dude named Porkins.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.546
They're like,
"oh, what should we name him?

00:17.564 --> 00:18.748
He's a big, fat slob."

00:18.782 --> 00:20.750
[laughter]

00:20.784 --> 00:22.251
How do you think
he made it on to the fleet?

00:22.285 --> 00:24.486
Were they that desperate,
where they just took anybody?

00:24.504 --> 00:26.288
If he's a good shot,
what matters

00:26.306 --> 00:27.456
Is his physique look like,
right?

00:27.474 --> 00:28.457
Well, he stood out, though.

00:28.492 --> 00:29.759
He hadn't shaved,

00:29.793 --> 00:32.595
So you could see, like,
his, like, six or seven chins--

00:32.628 --> 00:36.232
All, like, that weird
razor stubble.

00:36.266 --> 00:38.100
And not only that, but they
crammed him into that cockpit

00:38.135 --> 00:39.135
With, like, a shoehorn.

00:39.169 --> 00:40.736
Did he get his own
action figure?

00:40.771 --> 00:43.038
- No, I don't think he did.
- Bull crap.

00:43.073 --> 00:44.940
There's a porkins figure
out there.

00:44.975 --> 00:46.175
It came with a hot dog.

00:46.209 --> 00:49.145

01:24.014 --> 01:25.548
Hello, and welcome back

01:25.582 --> 01:27.149
<i>To another episode
of Comic Book Men,</i>

01:27.184 --> 01:29.485
The only show
that considers Mr. Mxyzptlk

01:29.519 --> 01:31.320
An incredible
terroristic threat.

01:31.354 --> 01:32.588
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

01:32.622 --> 01:34.256
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:34.291 --> 01:35.407
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:35.459 --> 01:36.625
Okay, man.

01:36.660 --> 01:39.011
So what have we learned
this week?

01:39.045 --> 01:42.998
There's a guy who came in,
and for whatever reason,

01:43.033 --> 01:47.837
One of your employees was, uh,
like a moth to a flame.

01:50.774 --> 01:52.141
- Hey, how you doing?
- What's going on, guys?

01:52.175 --> 01:53.509
I have this statue.

01:53.527 --> 01:55.978
I want to see if you guys
are interested in buying it.

01:56.012 --> 01:57.279
Nope.

01:57.314 --> 01:58.413
[laughter]

01:58.431 --> 02:02.084
Oh, this is a bowen
Juggernaut statue.

02:08.959 --> 02:11.360
You guys know about
the Juggernaut, I'm sure, right?

02:11.394 --> 02:12.862
Uh, yeah.

02:12.896 --> 02:14.563
Ming, tell the man what you know
about the Juggernaut.

02:14.598 --> 02:17.149
- Stepbrother of Professor X...
- Correct.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.935
<i>- First appearance, X-Men 12?
- Very good.</i>

02:19.970 --> 02:22.638
What year?

02:22.672 --> 02:23.839
1965.

02:23.874 --> 02:27.476
This guy knows his stuff.

02:27.511 --> 02:29.812
So why do you want
to move this one today?

02:29.846 --> 02:31.013
I just bought my own place,

02:31.031 --> 02:32.464
And I'm trying to go
to europe in the future,

02:32.516 --> 02:33.982
Maybe next summer.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.651
And I'm a teacher,
I don't make that much money.

02:35.685 --> 02:37.303
- Oh, yeah, what do you teach?
- Third grade.

02:37.354 --> 02:38.420
- Third grade.
- Yeah.

02:38.438 --> 02:39.755
You don't look
like a teacher, like--

02:39.789 --> 02:41.056
I mean, I wish
I had teachers like you.

02:41.091 --> 02:43.492
[laughter]

02:43.527 --> 02:46.028
Somebody's hot for teacher
over here.

02:46.046 --> 02:48.597
No, I'm just saying--
come on--

02:48.632 --> 02:50.599
I'm just saying--
rewind a little bit.

02:50.634 --> 02:52.201
When you were a kid,
all my teachers were, like,

02:52.235 --> 02:53.502
Old women in their 60s.

02:53.536 --> 02:54.920
Come on.

02:54.971 --> 02:57.056
Yeah, no hot guys.

02:57.090 --> 02:59.708
Yeah, none of those cool guys
dressed like him, and--

02:59.743 --> 03:02.561
- I'm just saying, my teachers
didn't look like that.

03:02.596 --> 03:03.679
I can't win.

03:03.713 --> 03:05.214
Wait.
Is it a boy?

03:05.248 --> 03:07.616
It was a guy.

03:07.651 --> 03:09.885
It was a young, like,
dude in his mid 20s.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.987
Why does it always
have to be you?

03:12.022 --> 03:13.088
I don't know.

03:13.123 --> 03:14.957
[laughter]

03:14.991 --> 03:18.093
How much money do you need
to get to europe?

03:18.128 --> 03:21.363
Basically, I want
to sell it for $350.

03:21.398 --> 03:24.366
I think I can get
$300 to $350, easy, for it.

03:24.401 --> 03:26.468
So that means...

03:26.486 --> 03:30.239
For me today, $225.

03:30.273 --> 03:33.642
I was looking to go
a little more than that.

03:33.677 --> 03:34.960
I know what you
were looking for.

03:35.011 --> 03:36.712
Well, that includes ming
actually putting the cash

03:36.746 --> 03:40.299
Into your pocket for you.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.850
I'll decline that one.

03:41.885 --> 03:44.386
How about we meet
in the middle somewhere there,

03:44.420 --> 03:45.871
In between, then?

03:45.922 --> 03:47.873
- You wanted $350.
- I want $350.

03:47.924 --> 03:49.758
How about we do $250,
call it even?

03:49.793 --> 03:51.343
$275.

03:51.394 --> 03:52.928
$250.

03:52.963 --> 03:54.897
$274.

03:58.068 --> 03:59.668
- All right.
- Deal?

03:59.703 --> 04:01.253
All right.
$274.

04:01.288 --> 04:03.572
Thank you.

04:03.607 --> 04:05.341
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.508
Send us a postcard from europe.

04:06.543 --> 04:08.544
- You got it.
- Have fun.

04:08.578 --> 04:10.663
Now you got a rep.

04:10.714 --> 04:12.414
- Thanks to you guys--
- What was going on there, man?

04:12.448 --> 04:14.550
- What?
- You liked the way he looked.

04:14.584 --> 04:17.486
- No.
- Nothing wrong with that.

04:17.519 --> 04:21.557
[laughter]

04:22.659 --> 04:25.327
- He looks defeated.
- Scared him off.

04:33.203 --> 04:34.503
- Hey, how you doing?
- How are you?

04:34.537 --> 04:36.071
My name is Nate Quarry.

04:36.106 --> 04:38.140
I've got an independently
published comic book

04:38.174 --> 04:39.808
I wanted to see if you guys
would be interested in carrying.

04:39.843 --> 04:42.127
Oh, it's a zombie book?

04:42.162 --> 04:43.729
<i>Well, it's called
Zombie Cage Fighter.</i>

04:43.780 --> 04:46.548
So, no, it has nothing
to do with zombies, right?

04:55.025 --> 04:57.326
There's a lot of zombie books
out there, man.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.527
Well, not one like this.

04:58.561 --> 05:00.295
This is based on my life.

05:00.330 --> 05:01.930
I'm a retired U.F.C. Fighter--

05:01.965 --> 05:04.266
- Oh, really?
- U.F.C., huh?

05:04.300 --> 05:05.634
Mmhmm, the ultimate
fighting championship.

05:05.669 --> 05:06.802
Wow.

05:06.836 --> 05:08.470
That's awesome.
How long did you fight?

05:08.505 --> 05:10.539
- About 14 years.
- Wow.

05:10.573 --> 05:13.375
<i>Man...
It's like Conan the Barbarian.</i>

05:13.410 --> 05:15.010
One man comes out,
one stays--

05:15.044 --> 05:16.745
The dude goes
into an octagon

05:16.763 --> 05:18.630
And actually bleeds
and gets his face shattered,

05:18.682 --> 05:20.582
And you're like, "that's just
like something that isn't real."

05:20.600 --> 05:22.851
[laughter]

05:22.886 --> 05:24.720
Have you guys
ever seen fights?

05:24.754 --> 05:26.922
I've never seen one live, no.

05:26.956 --> 05:29.108
- So, I mean, you wrote this?
- Uh-huh.

05:29.159 --> 05:30.993
I took my adventures,
things I've gone through,

05:31.027 --> 05:32.077
And then I threw in zombies.

05:32.112 --> 05:34.129
So it's not really
about fighting.

05:34.164 --> 05:35.397
It's not even really
about zombies.

05:35.415 --> 05:37.366
It's more about
what a man's willing to do

05:37.400 --> 05:38.767
To feed his little girl
and take care of her.

05:38.802 --> 05:43.505
Shelf space is pretty limited
at the stash.

05:43.540 --> 05:47.142
Maybe is there some way
we could sweeten the pot?

05:47.177 --> 05:48.777
I thought it was an opportunity

05:48.812 --> 05:52.031
To see if I could do
a little bartering.

05:52.065 --> 05:53.415
I stock Nate's book,

05:53.450 --> 05:57.102
And Nate shows us
a little training session.

05:57.153 --> 05:59.054
You want to see
a real fight, huh?

05:59.072 --> 06:00.489
Yeah, I'd love
to see a real fight.

06:00.523 --> 06:01.723
All right,
you know,

06:01.741 --> 06:03.158
I think I can make
something like that happen.

06:03.193 --> 06:04.359
I know this
isn't pro wrestling,

06:04.394 --> 06:06.061
But do you have a fun costume?

06:06.096 --> 06:08.363
Holy crap.
That's a great idea.

06:08.398 --> 06:09.364
Wouldn't that be awesome?

06:09.399 --> 06:10.932
To have two guys
dressed in costume,

06:10.950 --> 06:12.701
Like a superhero fight?

06:12.736 --> 06:13.952
Can you pull that off?

06:13.987 --> 06:15.487
That's ridiculous,

06:15.538 --> 06:18.006
But I think we can make
that happen.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.275
I think you got yourself
a deal, man.

06:20.310 --> 06:22.761
<i>We will stock
Zombie Cage Fighter</i>

06:22.812 --> 06:24.063
If you can get this match.

06:24.097 --> 06:26.248
- All right.
- To the death, right?

06:26.282 --> 06:27.683
- You got it.
- All right, man.

06:27.717 --> 06:29.017
I'll give you a call,
we'll set it up.

06:29.052 --> 06:30.519
- All right, thanks, man.
- Thanks.

06:30.553 --> 06:32.020
I'm going to call Kevin...

06:32.054 --> 06:33.689
See if he wants
to come out and see this, right?

06:33.723 --> 06:35.724
He'd love to see this, right?
He'll be here in a second.

06:35.759 --> 06:37.259
Look how hyped
you are, man.

06:37.293 --> 06:39.078
You're like a raging bull.

06:39.112 --> 06:41.113
Yeah, man,
I'm all amped up, man.

06:41.164 --> 06:43.198
This is--this is real,
like, man stuff.

06:43.233 --> 06:45.067
You mean there's a drastic
shortage of man stuff

06:45.101 --> 06:46.101
In your life.

06:46.136 --> 06:48.187
[laughter]

06:48.238 --> 06:49.271
Okay, I got some things here

06:49.305 --> 06:50.672
I think
you might be interested in.

06:50.707 --> 06:52.841
- What's in the bag?
- What's in the bag, man?

06:52.875 --> 06:53.892
All right, you ready?

06:53.927 --> 06:56.145
- Feast your eyes on this.
- Wow.

07:03.442 --> 07:04.842
What's your guys' thoughts

07:04.876 --> 07:07.177
On inter-species relations
in comics?

07:07.195 --> 07:08.312
Like...

07:08.346 --> 07:11.549
Scarlet witch
is married to an android,

07:11.583 --> 07:12.950
Not a real man.

07:12.984 --> 07:14.285
Did anyone
come down on that?

07:14.319 --> 07:16.754
The Scarlet witch's
brother came down on it.

07:16.788 --> 07:18.973
Quicksilver was like...
You know.

07:19.024 --> 07:20.107
"you married a machine!"

07:20.142 --> 07:22.193
And this is a dude
who'd been, um,

07:22.227 --> 07:23.778
Nailed by bigotry
his entire life

07:23.812 --> 07:25.062
'cause he was a mutant.

07:25.096 --> 07:27.231
I'm a firm believer
that comic book fans--

07:27.265 --> 07:29.266
We're very progressive thinkers.

07:29.301 --> 07:31.752
We don't have the hang-ups that
the rest of society has, right?

07:31.787 --> 07:33.838
I don't think most
of the rest of society

07:33.872 --> 07:35.556
Has ever posed
that question.

07:35.590 --> 07:37.308
[laughter]

07:37.342 --> 07:39.577
That's not one that really
comes up in real life.

07:39.611 --> 07:40.611
How you doing, guys?

07:40.645 --> 07:41.862
Hey, how are you?
How you been?

07:41.897 --> 07:43.314
All right, not bad.
Not bad. Good to see you.

07:43.348 --> 07:45.316
I got some things here I think
you might be interested in.

07:45.350 --> 07:46.700
I think it'll be
up your alley.

07:46.751 --> 07:48.652
- What's in the bag?
- What's in the bag, man?

07:48.670 --> 07:51.321
All right, you ready?
Feast your eyes on this.

07:51.339 --> 07:52.506
Underoos.

07:52.541 --> 07:53.557
Wow.

08:01.399 --> 08:03.267
They licensed everything,
didn't they?

08:03.301 --> 08:04.735
- They did.
- Yeah.

08:04.769 --> 08:05.970
They had marvel.
They had D.C.

08:06.004 --> 08:07.805
They had Hanna-Barbera.
They had Archie.

08:07.839 --> 08:09.106
Star Wars--

08:09.124 --> 08:11.208
They had He-Man,
if I'm not mistaken,

08:11.243 --> 08:12.209
Transformers--

08:12.244 --> 08:13.744
Transformers, A-Team.

08:13.778 --> 08:15.796
This was the be-all,
end-all thing to have

08:15.831 --> 08:17.447
When we were kids,
you know?

08:17.465 --> 08:19.550
Like, in gym class,
you would take your shirt off,

08:19.584 --> 08:20.985
Like, when you're
playing kickball,

08:21.019 --> 08:22.186
Just to let everybody know,

08:22.220 --> 08:24.088
Like, "hey, I'm wearing
my Underoos underneath."

08:24.122 --> 08:25.956
I just want to say,
for the record,

08:25.990 --> 08:27.458
Some kids
took their shirts off.

08:27.492 --> 08:28.859
Others of us were like,

08:28.894 --> 08:30.995
"I'm going to go sit
with the girls on their period."

08:31.029 --> 08:33.563
[laughter]

08:33.597 --> 08:35.366
I remember the commercial.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.969
And the commercials
were oddly sexualized.

08:39.004 --> 08:41.171
They were weird.
They were very, very trippy.

08:41.206 --> 08:42.590
Especially the girls' ones.
Like, they were--

08:42.640 --> 08:44.375
They were doing, like,
go-go dancer moves.

08:44.409 --> 08:46.293
They were, like, going, like...

08:46.328 --> 08:48.212
You know?
Like...

08:48.246 --> 08:50.231
Dude, I'm thinking
you could probably fit

08:50.282 --> 08:52.149
Into one of those underoos
if we buy them, right?

08:52.183 --> 08:53.584
You'd look hot, man.

08:53.618 --> 08:56.253
I buy both of these,
you wear them.

08:56.288 --> 08:57.788
- You put on that one?
- Yeah.

08:57.822 --> 08:59.423
We'll do the commercial, man.
We'll reenact it.

08:59.457 --> 09:01.692
Ming...

09:01.710 --> 09:04.378
He could do the young,
go-go girl moves.

09:04.412 --> 09:07.665
[laughter]

09:07.699 --> 09:09.533
Well, what do you think?

09:09.551 --> 09:11.468
I'm not putting on
a pair of panties.

09:11.503 --> 09:12.970
You puss.

09:13.004 --> 09:14.371
You're going to kill my dream
of us finally

09:14.405 --> 09:15.589
Getting to wear
a pair of underoos.

09:15.624 --> 09:18.075
- If you put these on?
- You'll do it, too?

09:18.109 --> 09:20.110
I mean, sure.

09:20.144 --> 09:21.829
All right,
what are you looking to get

09:21.880 --> 09:23.347
For the underoos today?

09:23.381 --> 09:24.498
Well, they're
pretty rare, man.

09:24.549 --> 09:28.085
So, I mean, I'm looking
for $150 for both.

09:28.119 --> 09:30.287
- Whoa.
- That's a pretty fair price.

09:30.322 --> 09:32.773
$150that's...

09:32.807 --> 09:35.192
That's a lot, though, man.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.294
Would you do 50 bucks
for them?

09:37.329 --> 09:38.662
- For both of them?
- Yeah.

09:38.696 --> 09:40.364
No, I can't do $50.

09:40.398 --> 09:41.799
I mean, that's
giving them away.

09:41.833 --> 09:43.450
$100.

09:43.485 --> 09:45.402
$50 apiece.

09:45.437 --> 09:47.354
They ain't going to come
back here again, man.

09:47.389 --> 09:48.906
How about $75?

09:48.940 --> 09:52.409
$90.
Come on.

09:52.444 --> 09:55.412
I'm going to have to stick
with $75, man.

09:55.447 --> 09:57.348
I hear you.
All right.

09:57.382 --> 09:58.332
$75.

09:58.366 --> 09:59.583
$75?
You'll take it?

09:59.618 --> 10:01.218
- Yeah, I'll take it, brother.
- You know what?

10:01.252 --> 10:04.288
We don't need to shake.
Yeah, better off.

10:04.322 --> 10:06.006
- $75.
- Thanks, pal.

10:06.057 --> 10:07.658
- All right, man.
- I appreciate it.

10:07.692 --> 10:09.660
Take care, guys.
Thank you.

10:09.694 --> 10:11.762
What do you think?
Let's try it.

10:11.796 --> 10:13.130
Yeah, you just want
to bust them open now?

10:13.164 --> 10:14.598
Just bust them open
and wear them.

10:14.633 --> 10:16.000
All right,
if you do it too, sure.

10:16.034 --> 10:17.351
Shake on it.

10:17.385 --> 10:21.505
All right, I'll put on
the girls' underwear.

10:21.539 --> 10:23.674
- In the store?
- In the store.

10:23.708 --> 10:26.210
I mean, I don't know
why I agreed to this,

10:26.244 --> 10:27.728
But, you know, I wanted to see
if he could fit

10:27.762 --> 10:29.146
Into the boys' ones too.

10:29.180 --> 10:30.147
So, you know, I--

10:30.181 --> 10:31.849
- Why did you want
to see that?

10:31.883 --> 10:33.684
I've said too much.

10:33.718 --> 10:37.254
[laughter]

10:37.288 --> 10:39.206
Come on, guys,
at the count of three.

10:39.240 --> 10:40.224
All right.

10:40.258 --> 10:43.460
One, two...

10:43.495 --> 10:45.429
Both:
Three!

10:45.463 --> 10:47.931
Come on, Ming.

10:47.949 --> 10:49.149
Whoa.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.468
No! No!

10:51.503 --> 10:54.104
No, I knew it!
Come on!

10:54.138 --> 10:56.573
Where's yours?
You said you'd wear yours.

10:56.607 --> 10:58.909
It's underoos.
I'm wearing them underneath.

10:58.943 --> 11:00.177
Come on!

11:00.211 --> 11:02.780
I didn't mean to wear it
on the outside.

11:02.814 --> 11:04.181
You knew what you meant!

11:04.199 --> 11:05.249
- No.
- Come on.

11:05.283 --> 11:06.650
That's it.
That's it.

11:06.685 --> 11:08.318
- Holy cow.
- I'm gonna go downstairs.

11:08.336 --> 11:10.120
I'm gonna cut this off me,
and I'm going home.

11:10.155 --> 11:12.656
Ming, where's the lasso?

11:12.674 --> 11:14.925
- Where's your tiara?
- No.

11:14.959 --> 11:17.394
Come on,
you fine piece of woman,

11:17.429 --> 11:19.096
Come on back here.

11:19.130 --> 11:22.466
This is the birth of the comic
book conscience right here.

11:22.500 --> 11:23.901
I could do $400.

11:23.935 --> 11:25.169
Can't do that.

11:25.203 --> 11:26.904
So you've never seen
a live fight before?

11:26.938 --> 11:28.739
- Never.
- Let's make it happen.

11:28.773 --> 11:30.040
Yeah!

11:32.480 --> 11:33.714
All right, let me
put it out there.

11:33.748 --> 11:37.117
Zombie apocalypse--
you become a zombie.

11:37.152 --> 11:39.753
Is there anybody
that you don't eat?

11:39.788 --> 11:41.321
Yeah, I'd say so.

11:41.356 --> 11:43.190
Can you be
a judgmental zombie?

11:43.224 --> 11:45.625
See, to me, like,
if I see, like, myself,

11:45.643 --> 11:46.894
There's too much blubber.

11:46.928 --> 11:48.996
I'm like, "I'm not going
to eat that fat.

11:49.030 --> 11:50.631
It's so gross and chewy,
the gristle."

11:50.665 --> 11:51.865
I'd go the other way, man.

11:51.899 --> 11:54.201
Like, I could stew you
in your own juices.

11:54.235 --> 11:55.702
Uh, walt?

11:55.737 --> 11:57.704
- I don't eat any humans.
- There's a new notion.

11:57.739 --> 11:59.606
What do you mean?
You'd go strictly animal diet?

11:59.641 --> 12:00.874
I'd go strictly
animal diet, yeah.

12:00.909 --> 12:03.210
See, that's teen zombie,
right there.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.329
That's who girls
could fall in love with--

12:05.363 --> 12:06.413
An undead boy...

12:06.447 --> 12:07.798
- Sparkly Walt.
- Sparkly Walt.

12:07.849 --> 12:09.716
And while
I'm eating an animal,

12:09.751 --> 12:11.985
I still cry when I'm eating it,
'cause I know I'm--

12:12.019 --> 12:13.554
- You're like
the american indian.

12:13.588 --> 12:14.838
He's almost like
a vegan zombie.

12:14.889 --> 12:17.124
No, no, I mean--
no, I would eat flesh.

12:17.158 --> 12:18.642
All you eat now
is chicken.

12:18.693 --> 12:20.627
Yeah, so I'll just hang out
on a chicken farm for a while.

12:20.662 --> 12:22.880
[laughter]

12:22.914 --> 12:24.331
I would eat
somebody like ming,

12:24.365 --> 12:25.666
'cause he's all lean.

12:25.700 --> 12:26.783
Yeah, but once you eat Ming,

12:26.835 --> 12:28.568
An hour later,
you want to eat him again.

12:28.586 --> 12:31.271
[laughter]

12:38.450 --> 12:39.550
Here you go.

12:39.568 --> 12:41.986
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:42.021 --> 12:44.855
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Enjoy.

12:44.873 --> 12:46.374
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

12:46.408 --> 12:47.658
I'm interested
in this, uh,

12:47.692 --> 12:48.693
Green Lantern/Green Arrow
book up here.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.628
- Number 76?
- Yeah.

12:58.303 --> 13:00.221
Are you buying this to fill
a hole in your collection?

13:00.272 --> 13:01.973
I've been collecting
green lantern stuff

13:02.007 --> 13:03.758
For ten years now, and, um,
it's one of the key issues.

13:03.809 --> 13:05.877
I'm looking to add it
to my man cave.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.145
If you collect
Green Lantern comics,

13:07.179 --> 13:08.413
You need to have that one.

13:08.447 --> 13:12.033
Green Lantern/Green Arrow
number 76--

13:12.067 --> 13:13.301
Pretty significant issue,
right?

13:13.335 --> 13:14.852
Oh, yeah, man, huge.

13:14.887 --> 13:18.456
One of the greatest team-ups
in comics history ever.

13:18.490 --> 13:21.526
When the "hard traveling
heroes" storyline began,

13:21.560 --> 13:23.327
I believe that's what they
grouped them all under.

13:23.362 --> 13:25.113
It allowed
the D.C. Comics universe

13:25.164 --> 13:27.331
To take a look
at social issues,

13:27.366 --> 13:29.734
Not to mention
a kind of political split

13:29.768 --> 13:32.170
That I never really thought
about before.

13:32.204 --> 13:34.055
And what was really cool
about these stories

13:34.089 --> 13:36.574
Is, like, there was no, like,
nice little wrap-up at the end.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.743
It wasn't like
Green Lantern and Green Arrow

13:38.777 --> 13:41.729
Solved all the world's ills
at the end of the issue.

13:41.764 --> 13:44.449
You know, that's up to us,
not up to a superhero.

13:44.483 --> 13:46.684
Yeah.
Excellent point, man.

13:46.718 --> 13:50.655
You don't need a magic ring
to change things.

13:50.689 --> 13:52.557
I mean,
this is the birth

13:52.591 --> 13:55.126
Of the comic book conscience
right here,

13:55.160 --> 13:58.028
And the legendary neal adams
did the artwork on this.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.064
That's why
you can feel the pain

14:00.099 --> 14:03.634
In the faces of the downtrodden,
you know, the poor.

14:03.669 --> 14:05.019
Remember that--
look at that face, man.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.905
That is just saying, like,
"you don't understand.

14:07.940 --> 14:09.407
And it's not
all about fighting."

14:09.441 --> 14:11.592
The whole issue was spent
letting people know

14:11.627 --> 14:13.711
That there are injustices
out there,

14:13.729 --> 14:17.849
And they don't have to be
committed by guys in tights.

14:17.883 --> 14:19.917
So I'll wrap it up,
then, right?

14:19.952 --> 14:22.720
Uh, you guys are willing
to negotiate price a little bit?

14:22.754 --> 14:24.689
Negotiate, huh?

14:24.723 --> 14:26.757
Pages are yellow,
cover's a little--

14:26.792 --> 14:28.192
- Right, it's not
an near-mint copy,

14:28.227 --> 14:29.827
But if it was
an near-mint copy,

14:29.862 --> 14:31.429
It'd be three times
this amount.

14:31.463 --> 14:34.632
I could do $400.
I'll knock 25 bucks off.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.000
Yeah, I can't do $400.

14:36.034 --> 14:38.102
Well, what can you do?

14:38.137 --> 14:42.106
I can do $250.

14:42.141 --> 14:45.042
$375.

14:45.077 --> 14:47.378
How about $275?

14:47.412 --> 14:50.498
$350I can't go
any lower than that, though.

14:50.532 --> 14:51.816
I can't do that.

14:55.337 --> 14:56.721
I could sell you
the trade paperback

14:56.755 --> 14:58.256
With all the stories in it.

14:58.290 --> 15:00.758
I'd buy that.

15:00.792 --> 15:02.226
- You want to do that today?
- It's $200.

15:02.261 --> 15:04.462
[laughter]

15:04.496 --> 15:06.097
It's got everything in here--

15:06.131 --> 15:07.932
All the great stories,

15:07.966 --> 15:09.834
The beautiful artwork
by Neal Adams,

15:09.868 --> 15:11.986
All at the fraction
of a cost.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.070
$30.

15:13.104 --> 15:14.489
Sounds like a deal.

15:14.540 --> 15:15.973
- Want me to wrap it up?
- Sure, yeah.

15:16.008 --> 15:17.859
I knew we could come
to an agreement, man.

15:17.910 --> 15:19.076
Thank you.

15:19.111 --> 15:23.781
It's what america's
all about, man.

15:23.815 --> 15:25.616
[grunting]

15:25.651 --> 15:29.253
It's the octagon.
How awesome is that?

15:29.288 --> 15:32.106
I've never seen
an M.M.A. Fight in my life.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.125
I don't think
I could handle it.

15:34.159 --> 15:36.427
But I always thought, like,
if you added an element to it,

15:36.461 --> 15:38.763
One element, if you
brought it close to comics,

15:38.797 --> 15:40.565
Like, having a fight
around capes,

15:40.599 --> 15:43.417
And, you know, uh,
flowers that shot--

15:43.452 --> 15:45.870
Maybe not acid,
but at least destructive water.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.138
At least urine.

15:47.172 --> 15:50.641
[laughter]

15:50.676 --> 15:53.544
What do you think
of the spot?

15:53.579 --> 15:54.812
- Wow.
- It's awesome.

15:54.846 --> 15:57.048
Did the costumes arrive?
How do they look?

15:57.082 --> 15:59.116
It looks awesome, man.
This is going to be killer.

15:59.151 --> 16:00.985
- I cannot wait to see this.
- Big surprise for that one.

16:01.019 --> 16:02.353
- I can't wait.
- The guys are ready?

16:02.387 --> 16:04.222
Oh, hell, yeah.

16:04.256 --> 16:06.690
- Snooge to the nooge!
- How are you, sir?

16:06.708 --> 16:07.925
What's up, buddy?
Nate Quarry.

16:07.959 --> 16:09.227
- Kevin.
- Nice to meet you, man.

16:09.261 --> 16:11.295
- Jason.
- Jason, nice to meet you.

16:11.330 --> 16:13.197
This is--
I got to be honest with you.

16:13.232 --> 16:14.482
Even just walking into a room
full of tough boys,

16:14.516 --> 16:15.499
I feel a little bit of fear.

16:15.534 --> 16:16.517
I can taste it.
What about you?

16:16.552 --> 16:17.635
I can smell it.

16:17.669 --> 16:19.237
- The fear, yeah.
- Can you smell it?

16:19.271 --> 16:22.840
Fear, and I can smell sweat
and manhood.

16:22.874 --> 16:24.909
[laughter]

16:24.943 --> 16:26.177
Get your nose
out of there.

16:26.211 --> 16:27.895
So you've never seen
a live fight before?

16:27.946 --> 16:29.530
- Never.
- Let's make it happen.

16:29.581 --> 16:32.083
Yeah!

16:32.117 --> 16:35.286
A matchup that's been years
in the making...

16:35.320 --> 16:36.687
Good versus evil...

16:36.722 --> 16:40.424
[cheering and laughter]

16:40.459 --> 16:42.627
- No way.
- Oh, sir.

16:48.391 --> 16:52.978
A matchup that's
been years in the making...

16:53.013 --> 16:55.414
Good versus evil...

16:55.449 --> 16:56.949
Skinny versus rotund...

16:56.983 --> 17:01.587
[drumroll]

17:01.621 --> 17:02.922
Jay and silent bob.

17:02.956 --> 17:06.559
[laughter and cheering]

17:06.593 --> 17:09.561
Yeah.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.464
No way.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.098
Oh, my god.

17:16.670 --> 17:17.987
This is unreal.
You guys--

17:18.021 --> 17:19.922
This is--
this was your idea?

17:19.955 --> 17:22.441
Of all the characters that we
could have watched fight.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.742
[laughter]

17:24.778 --> 17:27.012
I was not told
the whole story.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.079
You didn't lie.

17:28.098 --> 17:30.349
There were costumed fighters.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.985
But it was surreal
seeing a in-shape,

17:33.019 --> 17:35.120
Uh, tough version
of me.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.523
[laughter]

17:37.557 --> 17:39.792
I can't wait
till he gets in the corner,

17:39.826 --> 17:41.477
'cause I'm going
to teach him some of my--

17:41.528 --> 17:42.945
- You're his cornerman?
- Oh, I'm his cornerman.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.613
You be his man, like,
"get in there, rock.

17:44.648 --> 17:45.815
Get in and take."

17:45.866 --> 17:47.550
"don't give up!"

17:47.584 --> 17:49.001
Gentlemen, take your corners.

17:49.035 --> 17:52.338
We'll get you gloved up,
and let's get this thing going.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.974
All right, bro, just go in,
hit him in the throat.

17:55.008 --> 17:57.810
And then, uh, climb on his back,
rear-naked-choke him.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.445
Emote a little bit more
in the face.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.831
<i>Remind this fool,
"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</i>

18:01.882 --> 18:03.382
Only made $30 million
'cause of you."

18:03.416 --> 18:05.284
If he eats
too many twinkies,

18:05.318 --> 18:06.552
He's not going
to have the endurance.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.220
Channel your rage.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.805
<i>You're mad that cop out
didn't make more money.</i>

18:09.840 --> 18:11.357
<i>You're mad that people
made fun of Jersey Girl.</i>

18:11.391 --> 18:12.358
You're mad.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.359
You know what?

18:13.393 --> 18:14.960
If we win this,
they can go back,

18:14.978 --> 18:17.096
Drink some beers,
and smoke some weed.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.531
Get in there
and get him.

18:18.565 --> 18:19.999
- There you go.
- Okay.

18:20.033 --> 18:21.634
Bring it in.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.302
We're going to keep it clean--

18:23.336 --> 18:24.537
No nut shots.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.605
No nut shots?

18:28.675 --> 18:29.708
Ready?
Go.

18:29.743 --> 18:31.644
Come on, Silent Bob.

18:31.678 --> 18:32.945
Oh!

18:32.979 --> 18:35.080
All: Oh!

18:35.115 --> 18:36.248
Take him down, Bob!

18:36.283 --> 18:38.651
All right!
Ooh!

18:38.685 --> 18:40.486
See him work the coat?
He flipped the coat back.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.487
Yeah!

18:41.521 --> 18:42.922
[cheering]

18:42.956 --> 18:43.922
Encore, encore!

18:43.940 --> 18:46.659
Ass to ass.
[laughter]

18:46.693 --> 18:48.961
Get out our singles.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.229
All: Oh!

18:50.263 --> 18:53.966
Oh, snap!

18:54.000 --> 18:55.434
Coats are off!

18:55.468 --> 18:58.454
[all shouting]

18:58.505 --> 19:00.139
Get his back!

19:00.173 --> 19:02.241
Come on, Silent Bob,
strike back!

19:02.275 --> 19:04.443
Come on, man!

19:04.477 --> 19:05.744
[all shouting]

19:05.779 --> 19:08.047
Yeah, get him on his back!
Climb on his back!

19:08.081 --> 19:10.783
Paralyze him!

19:10.817 --> 19:13.986
[all shouting]

19:14.020 --> 19:17.089
[cheers, groans]

19:17.123 --> 19:19.258
- Bob tapped! He's out!
- He is out!

19:19.292 --> 19:21.393
Jay got him! Jay got him!

19:21.428 --> 19:23.228
You know, I-I still think
you got robbed.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.197
I know,
but while I'm with you,

19:25.231 --> 19:27.299
It's an age-old,
eternal question

19:27.334 --> 19:29.134
That I've been
asking myself

19:29.169 --> 19:30.336
And fans have been
asking for years,

19:30.370 --> 19:31.536
And we finally
got the answer.

19:31.554 --> 19:34.006
Jay versus Silent Bob--
what happens?

19:34.040 --> 19:35.307
Silent Bob gets put down.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.325
[laughter]

19:36.359 --> 19:39.745
Like a dog.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.998
Winner
by rear naked choke, jay!

19:43.033 --> 19:46.418
[cheers and applause]

19:46.453 --> 19:48.220
I knew that would be
the finishing move somehow.

19:48.238 --> 19:49.988
Yeah, I mean, that's what you--

19:50.989 --> 19:52.989
I gotta tell you,
it was pretty awesome.

19:52.990 --> 19:54.290
A, to watch some dudes fighting.

19:54.291 --> 19:56.891
B, watch jay and
Silent Bob fighting.

19:56.892 --> 19:58.892
That's a way for comic
book fans to feel macho.

19:59.093 --> 20:01.293
They'd just put costumes
on these guys.

20:01.294 --> 20:02.594
Sounds tough macho.

20:02.595 --> 20:05.795
[laughter]

20:05.796 --> 20:07.396
Let's gonna wrap it up for another

20:07.397 --> 20:10.297
testosterone episode
of Comic Book Men.

20:10.298 --> 20:11.598
I'm Kevin Smith.

20:11.599 --> 20:13.099
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.600
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:14.601 --> 20:16.601
It's clobbering time, kids.

20:16.602 --> 20:17.902
Good night.
