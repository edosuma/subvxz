<i> The Syrian national Sayid</i>
<i> Nassir was not patient zero.</i>

00:07.508 --> 00:10.109

00:10.111 --> 00:11.377
named Dr. Victor Cannerts.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.145
How could she do this to me?

00:13.147 --> 00:15.280
We're up against a woman
who just threw the only doctor

00:15.282 --> 00:18.517
with a hope of finding a cure
under a triple-decker bus!

00:18.519 --> 00:19.752
How do you think we'll fare?

00:19.754 --> 00:22.187
Somebody's got to put
a bullet in the man's head.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.789
You and your guys can be
first in line for a vaccine.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.791
I'm nowhere near having
a vaccine, and you know it.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.026
I said you were
working on one.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.394
That's the only reason
I'm protecting you.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.029
He's the reason I'm sick.

00:30.031 --> 00:32.965
Cinco, Cinco.
Stay away from my brother!

00:36.837 --> 00:39.071
We should, uh, disinfect
your cut again.

00:39.073 --> 00:42.441
How's it looking?
Not so great, Bertie.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.842
Cannerts didn't
create this thing.

00:43.844 --> 00:47.046
You set Henry Burns up
with a new facility

00:47.048 --> 00:47.980
to recreate the virus.

00:47.982 --> 00:49.581

Guilty as charged.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.423
Jana, what are you doing here?

00:57.425 --> 00:58.657
Escaping the Cordon.

00:58.659 --> 00:59.925
<i> Meese has a way to get out.</i>

00:59.927 --> 01:01.393
I'm here to see
if you'll take two more.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.795
I promised your mom
I'd get you out.

01:02.797 --> 01:03.796
And I think this is the way.

01:03.798 --> 01:05.831
There was a breach
of the Cordon.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.699
<i> The escapee made it to the DMZ</i>
<i> before he was caught.</i>

01:07.701 --> 01:09.568
We can't let our
guard down now.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.904
No one in, no one out.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.072
You coming?

01:13.074 --> 01:14.807
No, but he is.

01:14.809 --> 01:17.042
It's time to start
your quarantine.

01:17.044 --> 01:18.644
Everyone follow me.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.575

01:49.577 --> 01:51.310
Sealing the manhole covers,
setting the DMZ,

01:51.312 --> 01:52.611
that was bad enough.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.346
What about
the people inside?

01:54.348 --> 01:55.614
What if there's
someone down there

01:55.616 --> 01:56.882
when the explosives
go off?

01:56.884 --> 01:58.884
My men haven't seen any movement
or sign of life

01:58.886 --> 02:00.886

was shot two days ago.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.021
Look, Lex, we're
proceeding methodically.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.023
Shutting down one tunnel
sector at a time.

02:05.025 --> 02:08.494

be neutralized by day's end.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.923
We're fine.
She's fine.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.925
All right, now you give me
the rest of the payment.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.693
Then we'll go into the tunnel.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.428
We meet our contact at 2:30.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.963
Uh, what?

02:44.965 --> 02:46.031
You paid half.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.666
Now's the time to pay
the other half.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.134
That's not what we agreed on.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.402
We pay when we get out.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.937
It's my escape plan, my rules.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.940
It's only your escape plan
if we get out safely.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.342
Unless you don't think we're
actually gonna get out safely,

02:57.344 --> 03:01.079
in which case, why the hell

Dr. Cannerts,
what are you doing?

04:17.191 --> 04:19.725
I'm drawing the antiserum
from Thomas's blood,

04:19.727 --> 04:22.461
mixing it with interferon,

04:22.463 --> 04:26.732
and introducing it into Cinco's
bloodstream in real time.

No.

These tunnels were laid out

06:39.533 --> 06:42.300
We keep moving north until
we pass the Cordon boundary.

outside the Cordon.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.828
Probably maintenance.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.797
Seemed a lot closer than that.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.800
I need to speak
to the rest of the group.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.701
Privately.
About what?

07:16.703 --> 07:18.637
About whether you're the
right guy to get us out of here.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.405
Knock yourself out.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.943
Okay.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.912
So, normally we'd weigh out risk

07:26.914 --> 07:28.480

07:28.482 --> 07:31.716
but everything is unknown,
everything is risky.

we're weighing
the risks

07:33.787 --> 07:35.720
down here versus the
risks of the Cordon.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.556
We can go back.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.826
We really can.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.094
We'd like to keep going.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.130
Keep trying to get
our baby out.

And yet you called me in.

07:57.411 --> 08:00.178
I don't remember
getting your name.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.513
Blake.

08:01.515 --> 08:04.583
And, Lex, I'd like to look
at this as a conversation

08:04.585 --> 08:05.584
between coworkers.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.118
We want the truth to emerge,

08:07.120 --> 08:08.987

you want that, too.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.722
We want
the same thing.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.891
And your cronies watching

08:12.893 --> 08:14.626
from that camera in the ceiling,
they want

08:14.628 --> 08:16.361
the same thing, too?

08:16.363 --> 08:18.430
Yes. Yes,

08:18.432 --> 08:19.564
they do.

08:19.566 --> 08:22.033
And what we all want
is to try to ascertain

08:22.035 --> 08:23.301
who facilitated the breach

08:23.303 --> 08:25.003
of one
of the sealed manhole covers

08:25.005 --> 08:27.272
to allow the escape attempt
two days ago.

08:27.274 --> 08:31.443
Coordination is taking place
from someone on the Force.

08:31.445 --> 08:32.978
So you're accusing me.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.847
You did try to break in,
didn't you?

08:35.849 --> 08:39.184
Word is you tried to reach
your... girlfriend inside.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.753
Look, I'm not the criminal here.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.755
From where I'm sitting,
this looks bad.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.557
I'm trying to help you.

08:45.559 --> 08:48.527
No, you're trying to nail me
with something I didn't do.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.498
Are you placing me
on a code 16 hold?

08:55.235 --> 08:57.135
Not yet.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.638
But I'd sure love to continue
this conversation.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.439
Walking out
on OPS

09:01.441 --> 09:03.775
never looks good.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.177
From one coworker to another,

09:06.179 --> 09:09.147
if you're not forcing me
to stay,

09:09.149 --> 09:13.618
then this conversation is over.

09:32.539 --> 09:35.974

09:35.976 --> 09:38.343
TREY:

09:43.016 --> 09:44.249
Stop!
I need you to stop!

09:44.251 --> 09:46.384
Get off me!
Stop!

09:46.386 --> 09:48.820
I lost somebody, too, okay?

09:48.822 --> 09:50.355
And I'm angry.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.958
But it's a question for both
of us, man. What are we gonna do

09:52.960 --> 09:54.826
with that anger?
I don't know.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.828
But I got to do something.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.830
Think.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.833
Don't kill the one guy who
could get us out of this mess.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.035
(panting)

10:09.977 --> 10:12.444
(loud clang)

10:15.515 --> 10:17.916
(panting)

10:17.918 --> 10:20.452
Lucky you came by.

10:20.454 --> 10:23.655
I've looked at
a lot of bodies.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.674
Too many.

10:25.675 --> 10:27.692
And they-they all look the
same-- red, bloodshot eyes.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.394
It's like at the end,
they cried blood.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.696
Yes, orbital hemorrhaging.

10:31.698 --> 10:35.066
An unfortunate and dramatic
late-stage manifestation.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.268
Yeah, well,
Cinco didn't have that.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.704
And his-his nose and his mouth
were clean, too.

10:39.706 --> 10:40.639
He looked different.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.141
I assumed he'd bleed out
posthumously.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.209
That's not uncommon.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.578
You're saying he didn't?

10:47.781 --> 10:49.748
Were his clothes wet?

10:49.750 --> 10:50.915
Yeah, soaked.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.617
Like he dove in a pool.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.619
All right, I know it
means something, but what?

10:54.621 --> 10:57.088
It means Cinco didn't die
from the virus.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.857
He's exhibiting
the classic traits

10:58.859 --> 11:01.860
of a Cytokine storm.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.029
He died from my treatment.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.131
He outlived the virus.

11:06.133 --> 11:09.000
If we can tweak
the right cocktail

11:09.002 --> 11:11.403
for the treatment,

11:11.405 --> 11:14.572
we could be on the road
to a cure.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.041
ROY:
<i> But you can't do this.</i>

11:16.043 --> 11:19.110
<i> You guys don't have a warrant!</i>

11:20.514 --> 11:22.113
Hey, wait a minute,

11:22.115 --> 11:23.248
you got my recipe box.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.983
You can't take my recipe box!

11:24.985 --> 11:26.284
LEX:
Hey, Dad.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.619
Dad, let it go.

11:27.621 --> 11:29.254
Let my recipes go?!

11:29.256 --> 11:31.656
Let it all go.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.625
It's Lommers trying
to smear my name.

11:33.627 --> 11:36.528
Trying to get us to make
a false move.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.529
Get emotional.

11:37.531 --> 11:38.830
(door closes)

11:38.832 --> 11:39.931
You were right

11:39.933 --> 11:41.466
about them coming around.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.804
I pocketed this
before they got here.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.073
You didn't tell

11:48.075 --> 11:49.741
those jackals anything, did you?

11:49.743 --> 11:51.142
Hey, if there's one thing
I learned

11:51.144 --> 11:52.210
from having you as a father,

11:52.212 --> 11:54.145
it's that you don't trust OPS.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.814
Yeah.

11:55.816 --> 11:56.981
Any luck finding Leo?

11:56.983 --> 11:58.049
No, not yet.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.484
Thing I don't understand

11:59.486 --> 12:00.952
is you got all this intel

12:00.954 --> 12:02.721
against Lommers,

12:02.723 --> 12:03.888
you're waiting on one guy.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.623
I got OPS

12:05.625 --> 12:08.059
watching my every move.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.095
This is bigger than me.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.197
I need his help.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.232
Lommers is on the attack.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.301
That means you got her scared.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.670
You need to attack back.

12:18.672 --> 12:21.673
I can't just go to any paper,
hoping that they publish this.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.174
Got to be careful.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.376
The guy's good.

12:25.378 --> 12:28.446
He's trying really hard
not to be found.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.315
When you were on the force,

12:30.317 --> 12:32.450
you, um, used to say
how you were better

12:32.452 --> 12:34.619
than the detective
white boys' club.

12:34.621 --> 12:35.620
(chuckles)

12:35.622 --> 12:37.889
Closed more cases
than any of those fools.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.457
Then close this one.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.860
Either we take down Lommers

12:41.862 --> 12:44.095
or she takes us down.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.599
We got one shot at this.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.612
(rumbling)

13:05.085 --> 13:07.652
What is that?

13:07.654 --> 13:08.887
(Leanne crying)

13:08.889 --> 13:10.421
Shh.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.890
Is she all right?

13:11.892 --> 13:13.491
She's okay?
Yeah, yeah.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.666
All right,

13:21.668 --> 13:23.401
we gotta move.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.702
(crying continues)
Shh, okay.

13:24.704 --> 13:25.837
Shh.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.509
(screams)

13:34.080 --> 13:35.513
JANA:
Oh, my God!

13:35.515 --> 13:37.282
MEESE:
Get back!

13:44.858 --> 13:47.125
(coughing)

13:47.127 --> 13:49.794
JANA:
Teresa! Xander!

13:49.796 --> 13:51.696
Are you guys okay?

13:51.698 --> 13:53.097
(whimpering)

13:53.099 --> 13:54.666
(coughing)

13:54.668 --> 13:55.767
(Leanne crying)

13:55.769 --> 13:58.369
We're good, but we can't
get around that.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.004
Okay, we'll figure out a way
to circle back.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.339
Just stay there, okay?

14:01.341 --> 14:03.408
No! It's too risky.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.777
MEESE: They're trying to
cut us off from the outside.

14:05.779 --> 14:07.212
Clock is ticking.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.713
There must be another way.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.549
Xander?

14:13.320 --> 14:15.320
Look, you guys go on.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.121
We'll be okay.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.289
What? No, no.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.892
TERESA:
Please, your job is to get out

14:20.894 --> 14:24.596
and send people in to save
the rest of us.

14:24.598 --> 14:27.298
We're counting on you,
all right?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.472
Come on, let's go. We gotta go.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.575
Okay.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.111
You guys just be safe
getting back, okay?

14:40.113 --> 14:41.613
(crying continues)

14:41.615 --> 14:42.614
We will.

14:42.616 --> 14:43.982
Let's go.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.488
This test should tells us

14:50.490 --> 14:51.823
the exact mixture of interferon

14:51.825 --> 14:53.791
to go with Thomas'
blood profile.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.561
With the proper proportions,
we may be able

14:56.563 --> 14:58.963
to extend life
for those who have the virus

14:58.965 --> 15:00.498
exponentially longer.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.166
That's good, right?

15:02.168 --> 15:04.168
Only one problem.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.803
There's only one Thomas.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.739
Exactly.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.008
And at the rate
we need to draw blood,

15:10.010 --> 15:11.409
we'd end up killing the boy.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.177
We'd still never get
ahead of the virus.

15:13.179 --> 15:16.180
Could there be another source?

15:16.182 --> 15:18.383
Anyone in the Cordon?

15:19.686 --> 15:20.652
The odds.

15:20.654 --> 15:23.054
Based on these types
of antibodies...

15:23.056 --> 15:24.555
(sighs)

15:24.557 --> 15:26.791
about one in a thousand.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.293
Still, out of all the people
in the Cordon,

15:28.295 --> 15:30.561
that's-that's four
possible candidates.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.397
Well, then we'd have
to test them all

15:32.399 --> 15:35.033
and hope that we find a match.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.735
Then we test them all.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.904
Guys, keep to the outside.
(indistinct chatter)

15:39.906 --> 15:41.639
Let's go, keep 'em back.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.741
OFFICER:
Keep 'em clear
of those vehicles.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.010
Captain Scott.
Major.

15:46.012 --> 15:48.112
Thought you were having a powwow
with Internal Affairs.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.314
Powwow's over.

15:49.316 --> 15:53.351
I need a list of the APD liaison
schedule for the last week.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.686
Trouble in the ranks?

15:54.688 --> 15:56.955
Why don't you worry
about your own men.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.427
There you go.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.862
Keep me posted
of any changes.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.864
Will do.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.406
Coukos.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.177
What is it, Major?

16:19.179 --> 16:20.478
What are you doing on shift?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.513
Says Walden's
supposed to be here.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.382
Yeah.
He and I switched up

16:24.384 --> 16:26.117
morning and afternoon details
this week, sir.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.186
Then why didn't you change it
on the assignment schedule?

16:28.188 --> 16:30.421
Come on, Major, you know
the red tape that creates.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.789
It's easier just to do

16:31.791 --> 16:33.091
the straight swap.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.059
Next time, change the schedule.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.561
Yes, sir.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.832
Sir, I'm with the Atlanta
police. We'd appreciate

16:40.834 --> 16:42.433
your cooperation.
Can't help you.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.634
Would you please help?

16:43.636 --> 16:44.736
No.
Hey, you two, would you

16:44.738 --> 16:46.204
come to the hospital with me?
Sorry.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.905
No, I got to get
home to my kids.
Hey, everyone

16:47.907 --> 16:50.341
needs to get their blood tested.
It might be the way to a cure.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.876
We need your
cooperation.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.211
Bunch of liars.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.812
Hey, listen, I'm not infected.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.447
Hey!

17:05.125 --> 17:07.125
Morning.
Morning.

17:07.127 --> 17:10.495
Walden, good morning.

17:10.497 --> 17:11.929
Lex. What are
you doing here?

17:11.931 --> 17:13.131
What I'm doing is not

17:13.133 --> 17:14.799
taking a fall for your scheme.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.534
You were always
bellyaching

17:16.536 --> 17:17.869
about how
the afternoon shift cuts

17:17.871 --> 17:19.771
into your family time,
and now here you are,

17:19.773 --> 17:22.173
switching with Coukos
to get back on it.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.410
You're letting people
out the Cordon.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.512
Lex, no.
Come on, I stopped the guy.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.614
You shot the guy.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.551
What happened?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.620
Something went wrong?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.688
What, did he sneeze?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.892
Oh, he sneezed, so you shot him.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.798
Which means you must realize
how dangerous this is.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.103
We're being more careful.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.271
Who's we?

17:53.273 --> 17:55.173
Meese.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.140
Meese?

17:56.142 --> 17:59.043
Meese got screwed when you
threw him in the Cordon.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.879
This is a way for all
of us to do some good.

18:01.881 --> 18:05.016
Everyone quarantines 48 hours.

18:05.018 --> 18:07.051
I'm not sick, I swear.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.454
I would never
let that happen.
Oh, really?

18:09.456 --> 18:11.689
And you and Meese
have your MDs, right?

18:13.226 --> 18:15.910
What happens
if there's another

18:15.911 --> 18:18.595
resistant blood type like that
kid we had to send back here?

18:18.598 --> 18:21.232
And Meese
didn't get screwed.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.334
He went in voluntarily.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.702
He got paid, too.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.739
Oh, you didn't know that.

18:28.741 --> 18:32.710
We're helping people get out who
don't need to be in there, Lex.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.545
We're doing what's right.
Right or wrong,

18:34.547 --> 18:36.747
it stops today.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.750
They're blowing up
the CSO system.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.487
They're what?

18:42.489 --> 18:43.955
Lommers' orders.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.223
Lex.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.627
There are gonna be
more people escaping.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.230
They're already
down there.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.482
Any success
in rounding up donors?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.918
The people are scared.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.722
Scared of the virus.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.259
Scared of each other.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.363
I'm not the right person
for this.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.198
Any of this.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.901
You're a good
police officer, Jake.
(scoffs)

19:29.903 --> 19:31.669
The fact that
you're here,

19:31.671 --> 19:33.638
that you
stayed behind--

19:33.640 --> 19:36.274
speaks volumes
about your character.

19:40.580 --> 19:44.549
Kate always gave me a hard time
when I thought about giving up.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.918
She always saw me as...

19:46.920 --> 19:49.287
more of a hero than I saw
myself.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.755
She had a way

19:50.757 --> 19:53.191
of seeing the good in people.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.831
Yeah, she did.

20:12.145 --> 20:14.145
I have
an idea.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.425
SUZY:
Another one?

20:27.427 --> 20:29.660
There's no way
we're gonna get through here.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.266
We're going this way.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.440
You have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

20:42.442 --> 20:44.141
Yeah, I do.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.510
We're paying you a lot of money
and you're gonna

20:46.512 --> 20:49.146
get us killed
down here.

20:49.148 --> 20:51.449
Look, I got a family I'm trying
to back to as well.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.417
(muffled explosions)

20:53.419 --> 20:56.254
Go, go!

20:58.091 --> 20:59.290
Damn it!

20:59.292 --> 21:00.625
What's going on, Meese?

21:00.627 --> 21:02.460
I don't know.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.761
So now you admit you don't know.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.596
And we're trapped down here
and you don't know?

21:05.598 --> 21:07.398
(rumbling)

21:08.701 --> 21:10.868
QUENTIN:
Jana...

21:12.071 --> 21:13.304
Are we gonna be okay?
Yeah.

21:13.306 --> 21:14.805
I'm not going to let anything
happen to you.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.240
(rumbling continues)

21:29.389 --> 21:31.822
(indistinct conversation)

21:37.497 --> 21:40.431
Ann Scott.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.167
Jeff Joseph.

21:43.169 --> 21:45.236
Oscar Welch.

21:45.238 --> 21:47.605
Carl Pierson.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.807
Ashley Bowen.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.443
Timothy Hall.

21:52.445 --> 21:53.477
What's this about?

21:53.479 --> 21:55.379
George Owens.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.150
Katie Frank.

21:59.152 --> 22:03.187
These names...
these were fathers, mothers.

22:03.189 --> 22:05.323
Sons, daughters.

22:05.325 --> 22:08.192
These are the names
of the people we loved.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.894
And lost.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.663
The list and-and the pain
goes on and on.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.598
But what can we do

22:14.600 --> 22:16.500
to keep the list from growing?

22:16.502 --> 22:17.668
There may be one thing,

22:17.670 --> 22:19.203
and I'm-I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.538
It's a long shot,

22:20.540 --> 22:21.806
but it's a shot.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.341
I know what I'm asking here

22:23.343 --> 22:25.943
goes against
everything we've been told.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.845
And we've heard it all:
Stay inside.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.613
Keep four to six feet apart.

22:29.615 --> 22:30.881
We've had it drilled into us.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.983
But I'm asking everyone, please,

22:32.985 --> 22:34.819
gather as many people
as you can

22:34.821 --> 22:36.721
and come back here at 3:00 p.m.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.889
to be tested
for a possible antibody.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.025
This could lead to a cure.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.227
The hope may lie in one of us.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.032
Which means it lies
in all of us.

22:55.241 --> 22:57.208
PUNDIT:
I, for one, am glad
the president apologized.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.944
PUNDIT 2:
Hold up. Just because
they didn't do this attack

22:59.946 --> 23:01.879
doesn't mean they're never going

23:01.881 --> 23:03.147
to attempt one like it
in the future.

23:03.149 --> 23:04.882
I think an apology like this
is just an invitation

23:04.884 --> 23:05.916
for more aggression.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.385
PUNDIT:
Missing the bigger point.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.453
We were all so eager
to lap up this story...

23:09.455 --> 23:11.889
What does that say
about America? About us?

23:11.891 --> 23:12.957
PUNDIT 2:
Even you...

23:12.959 --> 23:14.925
Dr. Lommers... a word.

23:16.329 --> 23:18.162
Lex, I'm sure you're angry
about the inquest

23:18.164 --> 23:20.398
but after our last conversation,

23:20.400 --> 23:21.665
I had to make
certain decisions.

23:21.667 --> 23:22.666
Meese?

23:22.668 --> 23:24.502
The cop you sent
into the Cordon

23:24.504 --> 23:25.469
to clean up your mess?

23:25.471 --> 23:27.872
He's the one helping people
try to escape.

23:29.409 --> 23:31.776
And he has people
in the tunnels right now.

23:32.979 --> 23:33.978
So what do you want?

23:33.980 --> 23:35.413
Stop the implosions.

23:35.415 --> 23:38.983
Let me and-and a team
of my guys go in there

23:38.985 --> 23:40.484
and send back
the people trying to escape

23:40.486 --> 23:42.052
before they get killed.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.024
You have one hour

23:47.026 --> 23:49.760
to do what you need to do
in the tunnels

23:49.762 --> 23:51.962
and then I'm going to do my job.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.632
You mean blow them up.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.934
I mean secure the Cordon, Major.

23:56.936 --> 24:00.504
Whether you're out of there
or not.

24:02.508 --> 24:05.242
SUZY:
<i> It's been about ten minutes</i>
<i> since the last explosion.</i>

24:09.015 --> 24:11.315
How much further
to the extraction point?

24:14.620 --> 24:15.820
We're here.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.588
We need to get here.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.291
We need to go around this way

24:20.293 --> 24:22.560
because of the main tunnels
being cut off.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.261
I studied the layout diagrams.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.464
Can you get us there safely?

24:26.466 --> 24:28.132
Yeah.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.967
Okay. Then let's go.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.769
But keep moving.

24:31.771 --> 24:34.238
We don't stop, okay?

24:38.044 --> 24:40.244
Hold my hand!
I got you.

24:45.251 --> 24:48.219
I only made it a few blocks.

24:48.221 --> 24:49.453
It's all right, Bertie.

24:49.455 --> 24:51.121
It's all right.

24:51.123 --> 24:54.225
I was so sad
and missing you.

24:54.227 --> 24:56.694
The important thing
is we're together.

24:56.696 --> 24:59.430
But there must be something
I can do for you.

24:59.432 --> 25:01.599
No, there isn't Bertie.

25:01.601 --> 25:05.202
We both know what this kind
of infection means.

25:07.206 --> 25:10.107
Actually there is something
you can do for me.

25:11.644 --> 25:15.446
Open the good bottle of wine.

25:15.448 --> 25:16.947
The one we've

25:16.949 --> 25:19.617
been saving.

25:22.088 --> 25:24.288
(indistinct chatter)

25:28.394 --> 25:30.528
Uh, maybe people
are still on their way.

25:30.530 --> 25:33.430
Come on, it was always
gonna be a big ask.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.337
Let me handle this.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.675
What do you want?

25:44.677 --> 25:48.245
Check my blood.

25:49.549 --> 25:52.583
Maybe I can help.

26:03.863 --> 26:06.564
(indistinct chatter)

26:21.581 --> 26:24.014
Everybody synchronize
your watches.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.750
40 minutes until those tunnels
are destroyed.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.053
(phone chimes)

26:29.055 --> 26:31.088
Dad, I can't talk right now.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.723
Son, I found him.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.158
I found Leo.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.360
That's great, Dad.

26:36.362 --> 26:39.530
You know I never doubted you.

26:39.532 --> 26:41.165
Sure you did.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.900
But all is forgiven.

26:42.902 --> 26:46.370
Dad, I need you to do something.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.739
You meet Leo.
I'll catch up.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.608
Okay, what are talking about?

26:50.610 --> 26:52.176
I got a job to do.

26:52.178 --> 26:53.243
Screw the job!

26:53.245 --> 26:54.778
This is more important.

26:54.780 --> 26:57.314
You know I have a duty
as a police officer

26:57.316 --> 26:58.983
to help the people
inside the Cordon.

26:58.985 --> 27:01.051
If for whatever reason,

27:01.053 --> 27:03.587
I don't make it back,

27:03.589 --> 27:05.255
finish this with Leo.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.724
What are you talking about?

27:06.726 --> 27:08.292
Promise me

27:08.294 --> 27:09.793
that you'll carry the torch

27:09.795 --> 27:11.662
and take down Lommers.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.899
Yeah.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.901
I promise.

27:17.903 --> 27:20.871
See you soon, Dad.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.740
(siren wails nearby)

27:30.349 --> 27:31.749
(grunts)

27:31.751 --> 27:33.550
Hello?

27:33.552 --> 27:36.453
Anybody in here?

27:36.455 --> 27:38.222
(rat squeaking)

27:47.700 --> 27:49.700
(baby crying)

27:55.074 --> 27:57.875
(squeaking)

27:57.877 --> 27:59.843
Don't look, baby.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.445
Is she dead?
Looks like

28:01.447 --> 28:03.947
she tried to find shelter
when the virus got her.

28:03.949 --> 28:06.150
(sighs)

28:09.288 --> 28:11.555
(groans)
You all right?

28:12.591 --> 28:15.459
(panting)

28:18.497 --> 28:20.397
Let's go.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.132
No.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.969
This is my mom's store.

28:25.971 --> 28:29.173
Been my home since I was a kid.

28:29.175 --> 28:31.041
What are you saying?

28:31.043 --> 28:33.310
We stay.

28:33.312 --> 28:36.146
We clean it up, and we stay.

28:36.949 --> 28:39.416
I'm done running.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.090
MAN:
I'll take him over
to this side.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.558
(indistinct crowd chatter)

28:47.560 --> 28:48.926
MAN:
Just press your finger.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.360
See? Just a pinprick.
Okay.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.628
MAN:
Don't worry.
This won't hurt.

28:51.630 --> 28:54.098
Thank you, sir.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.166
MAN:
Ma'am.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.569
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

29:01.006 --> 29:03.207
Dr. Cannerts?

29:04.110 --> 29:07.144
Dr. Cannerts?

29:07.146 --> 29:09.813
Take a look at this?

29:09.815 --> 29:11.682
Whose is this?

29:11.684 --> 29:13.350
That guy in the white.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.221
You!

29:17.223 --> 29:18.622
You there!

29:18.624 --> 29:20.257
Stop that man.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.159
But don't touch him!
Hey!

29:22.161 --> 29:24.561
Hey, Father? Stop.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.597
Yes?

29:26.599 --> 29:28.198
Your blood--

29:28.200 --> 29:30.200
you have the antibody.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.069
We found you.

29:32.071 --> 29:35.739
The<i> Lord</i> has found me.

29:41.247 --> 29:45.482
(speaking indistinctly)

29:45.484 --> 29:48.619
All right, we split up, cover as
much ground as we can. Walden,

29:48.621 --> 29:51.188
I want you here
at the original egress point.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.123
Now, you see anyone,
you send them back,

29:53.125 --> 29:55.058
whether they look sick or not.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.627
Anyone resists,
you call for backup.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.495
We cannot afford
to mess this up.

29:58.497 --> 29:59.696
Everyone

29:59.698 --> 30:01.198
back here in 30 minutes!

30:01.200 --> 30:02.332
Yes, sir.
Sir.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.567
All right.
Move out!

30:03.569 --> 30:06.103
(garbled radio transmission)

30:06.105 --> 30:07.504
All right, getting lights?

30:10.042 --> 30:13.310
Go. Go on.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.912
Yeah, this is it.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.580
We're here.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.782
I'll see if my contact's here.

30:23.956 --> 30:26.790
(siren blaring in distance)

30:26.792 --> 30:28.792
(knocking)

30:34.767 --> 30:37.801
Leo Greene?
Yeah.

30:37.803 --> 30:39.369
I'm Roy Carnahan.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.505
Okay, I was expecting
your son, too.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.407
Yeah, well, you
just get me.

30:43.409 --> 30:45.442
Yeah, sure, come on in.

30:45.444 --> 30:46.977
Nice to meet you, too.

30:46.979 --> 30:49.546
Lex wanted me to give you this.

30:51.417 --> 30:54.384
What is it?
It's Lommer's head
on a platter.

30:54.386 --> 30:55.886
How's that sound?

30:55.888 --> 30:57.955
Pretty damn appetizing.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.900
(garbled radio transmission)

31:28.220 --> 31:29.887
See something.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.221
(overlapping chatter)

31:31.223 --> 31:34.124
What is it, Lex?

31:34.126 --> 31:35.626
(indistinct chatter)

31:35.628 --> 31:37.828
Looks like a baseball hat.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.099
It's a kid's.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.034
There are kids down here!

31:44.036 --> 31:46.336
Stay focused, Lex.

31:47.773 --> 31:50.340
20 minutes.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.116
Hey, stop!
Don't move!

31:59.118 --> 32:00.951
Walden!

32:00.953 --> 32:02.486
We're ready.
Forget that.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.888
Did you put yourself on
the inside on purpose?

32:07.693 --> 32:10.227
Doesn't mean what we're doing
isn't the right thing.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.361
But it's too risky.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.030
They're blowing the tunnels.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.164
We've got to stop.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.632
It's too late for stopping!

32:15.634 --> 32:18.068
You've got to go back.

32:18.070 --> 32:19.903
You know that.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.040
I agree.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.643
We've got to make this right.

As you asked.

33:10.789 --> 33:14.024
Are you really sure
you want to do this?

33:14.026 --> 33:16.226
I'm tired, Bertie.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.295
This is the best way.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.397
We usually don't have

33:20.399 --> 33:23.767
control over moments
like this in our lives.

(chuckles)

33:56.235 --> 33:59.469
We're at the Ridgemore Lodge.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.571
Outside there's
a light snow

34:01.573 --> 34:03.640
falling on the lake.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.142
And as we come down
the staircase

34:05.144 --> 34:07.277
to the ballroom,

34:07.279 --> 34:10.047
all eyes are on you.

34:10.049 --> 34:11.314
Are you wearing a tux?

34:11.316 --> 34:13.417
Of course.

34:13.419 --> 34:15.485
As we take the dance floor,

34:15.487 --> 34:19.423
the band strikes up
a familiar song,

34:19.425 --> 34:21.591
"Nearness of You."

34:21.593 --> 34:23.360
And as I pull you close,

34:23.362 --> 34:26.063
I whisper something

34:40.779 --> 34:44.514
I was never gonna
let you dance alone.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.516
(crying):
Oh, Bertie.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.618
Bertie, you didn't.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.887
You didn't.

34:50.889 --> 34:53.557
(sobbing)

34:53.559 --> 34:55.759
(crying):
I love you, Michi.

34:57.629 --> 35:00.430
I'll see you
at the Ridgemore Lodge.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.265
I love you.

35:02.267 --> 35:06.570
♪ Nearness of you. ♪

35:10.542 --> 35:12.742
(indistinct chatter)

35:13.979 --> 35:17.514
People of the Cordon,
do not come any further!

35:17.516 --> 35:19.549
For the health
and safety of others,

35:19.551 --> 35:23.453
you are not permitted
to leave the area.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.956
Lex?

35:27.092 --> 35:29.826
Jana?

35:31.997 --> 35:34.131
LOMMERS:
Lex?

35:34.133 --> 35:37.033
Lex, come in.

35:37.035 --> 35:39.236
Do you hear me?

35:47.379 --> 35:49.713
I can't believe it's you.

35:49.715 --> 35:52.849
I've wanted to see you so badly.

35:58.056 --> 35:59.956
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

35:59.958 --> 36:00.957
We're not sick.

36:00.959 --> 36:03.026
We were quarantined
before heading out.

36:03.028 --> 36:04.828
Look, no one needs to know.
We can keep it a secret.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.264
We can hole up at your place

36:07.266 --> 36:09.132
until we figure it out.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.239
We can be together.

36:16.241 --> 36:18.575
It's not that simple.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.477
Why can't it be?

36:20.479 --> 36:22.646
Because if I let you out...

36:22.648 --> 36:25.415
all of you--
everything I've done

36:25.417 --> 36:26.650
means nothing.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.084
The sanctity
of the Cordon

36:28.086 --> 36:30.487
is all that separates the rest
of the city from exposure.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.189
The rest of us are left
in here to die?

36:32.191 --> 36:33.690
I know--

36:33.692 --> 36:35.158
I know...

36:36.762 --> 36:39.296
But this virus
is unpredictable.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.231
It can mutate-- any one
of you could be a carrier.

36:41.233 --> 36:44.401
Any one of you can take
it out of these tunnels

36:44.403 --> 36:45.902
straight to the other side
and I can't let that happen!

36:45.904 --> 36:47.370
So, do you want us to go back?

36:47.372 --> 36:49.005
No.

36:49.007 --> 36:51.575
I don't know.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.777
What do you want, Lex?

36:58.584 --> 36:59.649
Lex, what do you want?!

36:59.651 --> 37:00.984
What do I want?

37:00.986 --> 37:02.719
The only thing I've ever wanted.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.654
To be with you.

37:14.266 --> 37:15.498
Lex, time is up.

37:15.500 --> 37:18.068
Lex?

37:18.070 --> 37:20.971
We've lost the walkie signal.

37:29.348 --> 37:31.047
Resume implosions.

37:34.253 --> 37:36.386
Dr. Lommers?

37:36.388 --> 37:38.888
Really?

37:38.890 --> 37:41.191
Major Carnahan understands
the concept of time.

37:41.193 --> 37:43.426
He knew the risks.

37:43.428 --> 37:46.029
Resume implosions.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.764
NEWSCASTER (on TV):
The stunning allegations

37:47.766 --> 37:49.132
about Dr. Lommers were posted

37:49.134 --> 37:51.501
by the controversial blogger
Leo Greene.

37:51.503 --> 37:53.637
These charges seem to have merit

37:53.639 --> 37:55.372
as they are corroborated
by secret recordings

37:55.374 --> 37:57.440
made of Dr. Lommers.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.776
LOMMERS (on TV): Americans want
security from their enemies

37:59.778 --> 38:01.311
without the responsibility
for how it happens.

38:01.313 --> 38:03.813
And if takes every last person
in the Cordon dying

38:03.815 --> 38:07.183
to increase our odds
of survival, then so be it.

38:07.185 --> 38:08.318
Guilty as charged.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.787
NEWSCASTER: We expect congress
to call for immediate hearings.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.922
Dr. Lommers is sure
to face sharp questioning

38:12.924 --> 38:14.457
from both sides of the aisle.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.593
This stunning turn of events
represents a radical shift

38:16.595 --> 38:18.662
for Dr. Lommers,
a respected scientist,

38:18.664 --> 38:20.964
who was thrust
into a more public role

38:20.966 --> 38:22.966
due to this outbreak.

38:22.968 --> 38:26.169
(continues speaking
indistinctly)

38:44.356 --> 38:46.423
JAKE:
<i> The neighborhood </i>
<i> where I grew up,</i>

38:46.425 --> 38:47.957
<i> nothing much changed.</i>

38:47.959 --> 38:50.427
<i> People rarely left,</i>
<i> rarely got rich,</i>

38:50.429 --> 38:53.096
<i> never got out</i>
<i> of their lot in life.</i>

38:53.098 --> 38:56.666
<i> The person you were born as</i>
<i> was the person you died as.</i>

38:56.668 --> 38:58.601
<i> This sickness--</i>

38:58.603 --> 39:02.572
<i> this virus and this wall</i>
<i> we built to stop it--</i>

39:02.574 --> 39:05.241
<i> has changed people.</i>

39:05.243 --> 39:08.611
<i> It makes all of us</i>
<i> see things differently.</i>

39:08.613 --> 39:10.980
<i> Some people have caved</i>

39:10.982 --> 39:12.682
<i> under the pressure.</i>

39:12.684 --> 39:14.017
(reporters clamoring)

39:14.019 --> 39:15.218
<i> The difficulties they faced</i>

39:15.220 --> 39:18.054
<i> only brought out</i>
<i> the worst in them.</i>

39:21.526 --> 39:24.728
<i> Other people have risen up,</i>

39:24.730 --> 39:26.363
<i> and surprised even themselves.</i>

39:32.871 --> 39:34.337
Will you?

39:34.339 --> 39:37.040
(quiet laugh)

39:39.745 --> 39:41.878
(newscaster speaking
indistinctly)

39:41.880 --> 39:44.748
<i> New, and sometimes</i>
<i> unlikely, alliances</i>

39:44.750 --> 39:47.751
<i> have formed.</i>

39:47.753 --> 39:49.886
<i> In the search for truth,</i>

39:49.888 --> 39:51.588
<i> some found not only answers,</i>

39:51.590 --> 39:53.790
<i> but redemption.</i>

39:59.064 --> 40:02.031
<i> The very concept of what it</i>
<i> means to be a family</i>

40:02.033 --> 40:04.834
<i> has been reshaped.</i>

40:04.836 --> 40:07.303
<i> Sometimes for the better.</i>

40:07.305 --> 40:09.973
Bye.

40:23.388 --> 40:26.456
<i> And then there</i>
<i> are those who felt</i>

40:26.458 --> 40:28.925
<i> they needed to chose between</i>
<i> their heart and their duty.</i>

40:28.927 --> 40:33.062
<i> And in the end,</i>
<i> found a way to choose both.</i>

40:43.108 --> 40:45.408
<i> This Cordon has changed me.</i>

40:45.410 --> 40:47.777
<i> The one thing I never thought</i>
<i> I'd find in all this sadness</i>

40:47.779 --> 40:50.280
<i> and sickness and death</i>

40:50.282 --> 40:53.183
<i> is love.</i>

40:54.553 --> 40:56.686
<i> And I'm going to try</i>
<i> and honor that.</i>

40:56.688 --> 41:01.891
<i> And be one of the people</i>
<i> who rises up.</i>

41:26.485 --> 41:28.585
I love you, Katie.
