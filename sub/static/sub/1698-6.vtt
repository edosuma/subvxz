00:16.149 --> 00:19.190
Yaow ming, I like the
view up from here!

00:19.890 --> 00:24.130
Hello ladies...
Jackson Stewart. Tall guy.

00:24.170 --> 00:27.190
Can't reach that?
Let me get it for you!

00:29.530 --> 00:31.900
Oh yeah! I should have done
this years ago... oh...

00:34.690 --> 00:36.010
What are you doing on the floor?

00:36.370 --> 00:38.530
Just... lost something.

00:38.790 --> 00:44.320
Oh! If it's your dignity, you might want
to check the empty box of platform shoes!

00:44.780 --> 00:48.680
I can take these back. Good luck finding
a store to take back that overbite.

00:52.560 --> 00:56.630
Sometimes I wish I had a brother.
And then I come over here... all better!

00:57.500 --> 01:00.840
So where were you guys anyway and...
why couldn't you still be there?

01:01.010 --> 01:02.400
Rock and Roll fashion awards.

01:02.410 --> 01:07.440
Oh, and it was endless. I mean four hours
to find out who won best knee socks? Ptt.

01:08.680 --> 01:11.710
Oh, and by the way,
Avril Lavigne, so robbed!

01:12.310 --> 01:14.150
You're just mad because you
didn't like the swag bag.

01:14.150 --> 01:16.240
Miley, there's nothing
in it for guys... I mean,

01:16.260 --> 01:22.370
moisturisers, mousses,
root rejuvenator... what is that?

01:22.490 --> 01:25.570
I'll tell you what it is.
The perfect gift for my next girlfriend!

01:25.880 --> 01:27.100
thank you very much.

01:27.790 --> 01:29.830
Hate to burst your
bubble buddy, but

01:29.950 --> 01:32.520
that stuff expires in three years.

01:37.820 --> 01:39.000
Hey, don't listen to Oliver.

01:39.420 --> 01:42.510
I mean, I love mine.
Free lip glopper,...

01:42.720 --> 01:44.420
this is the best swag bag ever.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.470
Oh-ow! My lips turned numb.
I can't feel my lips!

01:48.490 --> 01:49.950
I can feel your spit.

01:50.590 --> 01:53.250
Oh, hey Oliver,
you can have my neck pillow.

01:53.270 --> 01:56.440
No, no, no. You should save that for the
plane on the class trip to Washington.

01:56.690 --> 02:00.350
Oh yeah. That. I'm not going.

02:01.290 --> 02:03.940
Wait, what do you mean
you're not 'bowing'.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.810
I just can't afford it this year.

02:05.810 --> 02:06.730
I can pay for you.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.250
No, that's too much money.

02:08.250 --> 02:10.370
That's not too much bunny... money.

02:10.660 --> 02:13.930
Just think of it as...
an early half birthday present.

02:15.010 --> 02:18.620
Well you know, actually, tomorrow's my half,
half birthday, two weeks removed.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.270
And I've never been to Italy.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.420
Oh, you know where
else you've never been.

02:22.430 --> 02:23.940
Where? Wow!

02:24.850 --> 02:25.760
Please!

02:27.090 --> 02:28.700
There will be other trips.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.270
Local ones like...

02:30.710 --> 02:34.330
to the museum of natural history!

02:38.220 --> 02:39.130
You know Miley

02:39.200 --> 02:43.860
I mean I could be wrong...
but I think she really wanted to go.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.160
You are a shining lighthouse
in the bay of stupidity.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.170
Well I have my moments!

03:49.180 --> 03:52.910
So while you future leaders of
America visit Washington....

03:53.670 --> 03:54.960
my city,

03:55.680 --> 03:59.460
remember, all men are creatd equal,
never tell a lie,

03:59.700 --> 04:01.200
and when picking up your costume...

04:01.990 --> 04:04.040
always check the size.

04:06.870 --> 04:08.490
Ar, Lily, do you have a sec?

04:08.730 --> 04:10.200
Yeah... what's up Mr. C?

04:10.280 --> 04:15.640
Great news! Looks like just enough money in
the budget for one extra student to go to Washington!

04:16.149 --> 04:18.360
And I. Was Thinking. You!

04:18.720 --> 04:19.990
Really! Yeah!

04:20.100 --> 04:22.840
Thank you so much Mr. C,
you're the best teacher in the whole world.

04:23.550 --> 04:24.630
I told you it would work.

04:24.790 --> 04:26.550
You know Miley,
you are the best friend ever.

04:26.870 --> 04:31.220
And when you take me to Italy I'm going to
buy you a pizza of your choice one topping. Let's not get greedy.

04:31.920 --> 04:36.260
I can't wait to tell the guys I'm going...
Why is there a cheque from Miley hanging out of your D.C. Tour book?

04:36.500 --> 04:37.060
Uh-ow.

04:37.290 --> 04:38.530
Ar...

04:39.810 --> 04:44.750
I don't know, she's a girl! Why are you
interrogating me, what are you, my mother? Gosh!

04:46.990 --> 04:50.180
Eight years of community theatre
and this is the best you can act?

04:50.380 --> 04:54.710
I do townspeople!
And off stage voices!

04:56.350 --> 04:58.460
Miley Ray Stewart!

04:58.510 --> 05:00.650
Miley's not here right now,
leave a message! Beep!

05:06.970 --> 05:08.850
I see you.

05:09.930 --> 05:12.520
OK, I just wanted you to go on the
trip with me, what's the big deal?

05:12.560 --> 05:17.530
The big deal is it makes me feel like I'm
stealing off you, if I can't pay for it myself, I'm not going.

05:18.220 --> 05:19.430
I've got an idea.

05:19.700 --> 05:21.340
We're not going to Italy Oliver.

05:22.660 --> 05:28.120
I was talking about...
Lily having a rummage sale.

05:28.950 --> 05:30.870
And I will hold for the applause.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.650
Hey! A rummage sale,
that's a great idea!

05:34.670 --> 05:37.390
I've got tons of stuff I don't need.
I could totally raise the money.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.860
Thank you, Oliver! Yeah,
you're welcome Lily.

05:40.230 --> 05:42.090
Oliver! That's... a great idea.

05:42.460 --> 05:46.700
Well you see, that's the thing.
The Oken Mind... I'm always thinking.

05:46.840 --> 05:47.780
I'll never...

05:57.550 --> 06:04.860
yeah yeah...I got it...
no no...just a minute

06:04.900 --> 06:08.640
Rico, Rico, dude, I got half the beach here!
Could you do something?

06:08.740 --> 06:11.140
OK. I'll see what I can do.

06:13.480 --> 06:17.690
Hey other half of the beach!
Two for one hot-dog sale!

06:20.940 --> 06:24.390
He's kidding! He's totally kidding!

06:33.080 --> 06:34.450
Rico, you're killing me here.

06:34.740 --> 06:36.230
Would you please
hire some more help!

06:36.590 --> 06:38.220
What do you think,
I'm made of money?

06:40.260 --> 06:44.400
Oh look, I guess I am. My mistake.

06:46.380 --> 06:48.950
Oh no. She's back!

06:50.520 --> 06:52.580
Sarah's still got a thing for you?

06:53.840 --> 06:57.940
Well, it's understandable.
She's always picking up... garbage.

06:58.140 --> 07:00.110
It's not funny. She's obsessed.

07:01.660 --> 07:02.820
Tell me when she's gone!

07:04.720 --> 07:06.160
Hey Sarah, what's going on?

07:06.200 --> 07:07.350
Just cleaning up the beach.

07:07.480 --> 07:11.790
I'm getting raw materials for my -
-- Jackson sculpture!

07:12.330 --> 07:13.960
Wow, you are crazy.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.080
... about him.

07:19.070 --> 07:22.290
Hey, how would you
like to work here...

07:22.640 --> 07:26.040
next to Jackson... all day long?

07:27.770 --> 07:29.740
you mean Getting paid while
I'm working down my man?

07:30.970 --> 07:31.620
You bet!

07:32.070 --> 07:33.350
Great! You start next week.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.340
- OK! Bye!

07:37.740 --> 07:38.550
Aah!!

07:39.100 --> 07:42.530
Nooo! Not the money suit! ah!

07:50.290 --> 07:51.670
Thank you! Tell your friends.

07:53.830 --> 07:55.520
Oah... Hey Lily,
how much for this sketchy thing?

07:55.520 --> 07:56.470
Five bucks.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.110
I'll give you a buck fifty.

07:59.310 --> 08:00.770
Forget it!

08:03.520 --> 08:05.100
But it's missing a knob!

08:05.920 --> 08:08.720
You're a knob! I'm trying to get to
Washington, why are you haggling!

08:08.830 --> 08:11.820
What happened to 'the customers
always right'? Oh... my goodness.

08:14.220 --> 08:15.910
Hey guys, hows it going?

08:16.200 --> 08:22.420
Great, it's going great! I am in the
perfect location. I am wearing my lucky hat and hey... I just sold a lamp for a dollar!

08:22.520 --> 08:24.550
Oh great! So how much is
that you've made so far?

08:25.020 --> 08:26.020
A dollar.

08:27.220 --> 08:29.570
Stupid hat, wake up! Start working!

08:29.710 --> 08:31.850
Hey, hey. Maybe it already has.

08:32.090 --> 08:34.850
I ar, found some stuff I was just about to
throw out, and I'd like to donate it to the cause.

08:35.220 --> 08:36.780
- Oh, I guess that'd be OK.
- cool

08:40.140 --> 08:41.020
Are you kidding me!

08:41.520 --> 08:46.110
What! This stuff isn't new... it's just...
I like to keep the boxes, in... in case we move.

08:48.350 --> 08:54.950
Oh man... the Takamori 1080 3D-HD!
This just came out today!

08:56.740 --> 08:58.200
I'll give you five bucks for it.

08:58.960 --> 09:03.090
Miley! We talked about this. I'm going to
earn this money by myself, now take that stuff back.

09:04.470 --> 09:05.340
Fine.

09:07.060 --> 09:09.410
Oh, how much for this! Five bucks.

09:09.410 --> 09:10.640
I'll give you a thousand. Miley!

09:10.680 --> 09:11.360

09:17.320 --> 09:19.340
Hey! Look at all these people.

09:20.160 --> 09:25.540

these Hannah Montana autographed socks! - What? I don't have any ...

09:26.600 --> 09:28.320
Hold on, hold on,
I'll get to everyone.

09:31.510 --> 09:32.820
Oh Miss Montana!

09:33.400 --> 09:36.710
Oh. Oh hi there person I've
never met before in my life.

09:36.860 --> 09:39.320
I'm just trying out this fine pen.

09:39.370 --> 09:43.620
Hopefully I didn't damage... or radically
increase the price of any of these items.

09:43.730 --> 09:45.010
- Out!
- I'm going.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.510
Leave the pen!

09:47.590 --> 09:53.730
Oh right! This pen. I'll just put it on the
table with all these other stuff I'm touching.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.090
Me, Hannah Montana!

10:00.520 --> 10:02.390

10:02.700 --> 10:06.470
Well... ar... you made enough
to get to Washington.Yes!

10:06.470 --> 10:09.990
If you left... ar, from you know,
Washington.Ohhh...

10:11.220 --> 10:14.000
Lily, I don't know why you didn't just
sell some of that signed Hannah stuff.

10:14.150 --> 10:17.690
Forget it! So,
.. I'll stay home. So what.

10:18.220 --> 10:27.040
Someone has to... get peoples mail... and
water their stupid plants and... feed their boring little ungrateful turtles...

10:27.430 --> 10:28.600
Bring me back a t-shirt.

10:31.290 --> 10:36.520
I'm sorry Lily. T-shirts are a
little bit more expensive than that.

10:40.910 --> 10:43.940
Oh, excuse me,
where did you get that hat!

10:43.960 --> 10:46.760
A gift store specializing
in unlucky junk.

10:47.130 --> 10:49.110
- I'll give you a thousand bucks for it!
- What!

10:49.520 --> 10:51.840
That's an authentic New
Jersey Knight's hat!

10:51.930 --> 10:55.560
You know, my father, he played
second base for them. In the 1940's!

10:56.000 --> 10:57.420
Please let me buy it.

10:57.900 --> 11:01.310
I mean... a thousand dollars and
I only paid two bucks for it.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.850
- You need five hundred to get to DC.
- Five hundred and it's yours.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.270
T-shirt!- Five twenty!-

11:09.440 --> 11:10.050
There you go.

11:12.180 --> 11:15.330
- Thank you so much.
- No, no, no. Thank you!

11:17.850 --> 11:21.250
Hey Lily! Either somebody's got sand
in their pants or they're going to DC!

11:21.370 --> 11:22.810
Little bit of both! Whoa!

11:25.930 --> 11:27.770
wait wait! Wait a minute...

11:28.440 --> 11:33.830
my father played second base? I'll give you
a thousand bucks? Miley! You set this up.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.150
Set what up?
What are you talking about?

11:35.310 --> 11:38.970
Look me in the eye and super secret swear
that you did not give that guy money to buy my hat.

11:40.230 --> 11:44.070
Lily, I did not give that guy money
to buy your hat. Super secret swear.

11:44.260 --> 11:45.640
Yes! I'm going to DC!

11:50.200 --> 11:50.990
What!

11:52.370 --> 11:54.950
I did not give that guy
money to buy Lily's hat!

11:55.590 --> 11:57.050
I gave it to his wife,
she gave it to him.

12:00.330 --> 12:02.500
Miley, you know she's
gonna find out someday.

12:03.360 --> 12:08.710
Yeah, I know but see I thought about it,
and find then I probably done so many things that are worse so it won't really matter.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.100
S-weet!

12:22.640 --> 12:23.630
You see that smile?

12:25.490 --> 12:30.350
'Cause of me! That laugh - I did that!
Sometimes a little white lie can make it all good.

12:33.420 --> 12:37.250
And sometimes a little red hat
can make that all go away...

12:37.640 --> 12:38.350
Huh?

12:40.020 --> 12:44.270
Oh no. The guy I got to buy Lily's
hat was Blabby Bobby's daddy!

12:44.680 --> 12:47.620
You know this wouldn't of happened if
we were in Italy... they were beret's!

12:47.680 --> 12:48.930
That's France!

12:49.570 --> 12:52.010
Now... just... just distract her!

12:52.010 --> 12:52.640
How?

12:52.650 --> 12:55.060
Lily! Oliver's having
trouble breathing!

12:55.170 --> 12:56.220
I am? Aww!

12:56.640 --> 13:00.060
I think it's the reaction to being
underground. Try to relax him,  I'll go get Corelli!

13:01.590 --> 13:04.060
- Oh, oh, OK. Are you a 
little bit nervous there? -she...

13:04.750 --> 13:07.530
Yes, yes, I know!
Miley's getting help...

13:07.530 --> 13:09.800
don't worry,
you're going to be fine.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.500
Hey Blabby!

13:11.830 --> 13:13.270
How's the trip going so far?

13:13.620 --> 13:15.770
You have great hair.
Let me touch it!

13:16.240 --> 13:17.410
oh yeah!

13:17.580 --> 13:20.040
Ah... Miley... I have a girlfriend.

13:20.110 --> 13:21.010
Cool.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.680
See you at the White House!

13:23.060 --> 13:24.800
Um... can I have my hat back?

13:24.820 --> 13:25.520
What hat?

13:26.250 --> 13:29.030
- Oliver says you punched him!
- Good luck getting to France!

13:29.660 --> 13:30.580
He's a liar.

13:31.740 --> 13:33.500
Hey! Is that my hat?

13:33.570 --> 13:34.180
No.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.680
Nop! His hat.
See ya, buh-bye Blabby!

13:36.970 --> 13:40.890
Yeah, my dad got it at a rummage sale last
week and told me not to tell anybody. Woops!

13:41.200 --> 13:43.980
Doohp!See!
I told you it was my hat.

13:44.440 --> 13:47.060
Hey, Blabby, be careful, I mean, I know how
much it means to your grandfather

13:47.700 --> 13:48.510
What?

13:48.900 --> 13:51.160
Your grandfather,
the one who played ball.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.290
Yeah, yeah! MVP 1948!
You must be so proud.

13:57.620 --> 13:59.710
Who wants to sing the Subway song?

13:59.970 --> 14:03.640
The wheels on the train go
clickity-clack, clickity clack...

14:03.690 --> 14:04.780
You lied to me!

14:05.350 --> 14:09.170
- Well ...
- You super-secret swore that you had n othing to do with me getting the money!

14:09.750 --> 14:11.310
Look... I... I did it for you!

14:11.540 --> 14:14.360
No you didn't! If you had done it for me
you wouldn't of done it because I told you I didn't want you to do it,

14:14.420 --> 14:18.020
but you did it anyway, so you did
it for you. You .. dooer for youer!

14:18.900 --> 14:20.570
Come on Lily, give me a break!

14:20.880 --> 14:22.950
We're in DC! Everybody lies here.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.100
Hold on kids, we're about to...

14:28.680 --> 14:33.320
It's OK... my tazer
broke my fall! Arghh!!

14:45.220 --> 14:47.830
Would you stop that! Just...
get to work!

14:55.470 --> 14:57.640
Sarah... this is never
going to happen!

14:57.680 --> 14:58.600
Yes it is!

15:00.230 --> 15:01.260
Hey Jackson...

15:02.320 --> 15:04.440
Step off sister! Or I'll hurt you!

15:05.900 --> 15:07.190
Have a nice day!

15:10.400 --> 15:12.410
Hey! You have got
to get rid of her!

15:12.620 --> 15:14.550
Why... is she driving you crazy?

15:14.590 --> 15:17.600
- Yeah!
- Good! Then she's doing her job.

15:26.530 --> 15:27.910
Who ordered the nachos?

15:28.380 --> 15:29.110
That's me.

15:29.620 --> 15:30.630
Hold out your hands

15:32.720 --> 15:35.710
What about a plate!

15:35.940 --> 15:41.970
Ah... plates come from trees. Trees give us
oxygen. We need oxygen to live, do you want to die!

15:42.350 --> 15:43.700
I'm not paying for this.

15:44.680 --> 15:48.590
Not paying! why not pay!
Who's not paying!

15:49.300 --> 15:52.470
It's funny. People are having a
hard time with Rico's growing green.

15:52.580 --> 15:53.810
Rico's growing what!

15:54.040 --> 15:55.380
Can I get a refill on my soda?

15:55.520 --> 15:56.680
Sure! Hands or mouth?

15:57.170 --> 15:58.410
Hands.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.920
Must be a problem with the new generator.
You get what you pay for.

16:21.650 --> 16:22.760
Pick it up, pick it up!

16:22.840 --> 16:26.130
Sorry Sarah, I just need a little break,
my legs are cramping.

16:26.310 --> 16:29.380
We're saving a planet here!
Suck it up, Dad!

16:29.940 --> 16:32.160
Alright! I lost sight
of the big picture.

16:32.210 --> 16:34.660
Come on, pick the pace,
on the way, on the way

16:35.180 --> 16:40.040
Well, well, well. Who's having a
problem with our new employee now?

16:40.110 --> 16:42.970
You're right.
Green girl's gotta go!

16:44.240 --> 16:45.490
Sarah! Over! Here!

16:47.600 --> 16:48.870
Did I do something wrong?

16:49.170 --> 16:50.510
Where do I begin?

16:50.670 --> 16:56.150
No plates, no cups, no customers,
no cash, no HAPPY!

17:00.430 --> 17:03.160
Hey Lance Armstrong! Slow down!

17:03.460 --> 17:07.230
You the bird from
mother Ha ha ha ha

17:12.010 --> 17:18.550
I'm sorry Sarah, but in the words of my
hero, the great Donald Trump, bless be his name.

17:19.020 --> 17:19.869
You're F...F...F...

17:22.650 --> 17:23.500
What are you doing?

17:24.359 --> 17:25.560
Being brave.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.640
You're FI... FI...

17:36.110 --> 17:37.550
PROMOTED!

17:37.750 --> 17:38.190
What!

17:38.250 --> 17:40.440
From now on,
you're assistant manager.

17:40.540 --> 17:41.220
Really!

17:41.670 --> 17:43.550
Just get some plates
and cups we can use.

17:43.790 --> 17:47.580
I know where we can get environmentally
friendly paper products made out of elephant poop!

17:49.790 --> 17:52.820
Great... just don't
tell the customers.

17:53.980 --> 17:55.780
Rico, what are you doing!

17:55.830 --> 17:58.670
You got a problem?
Take it up with your new boss.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.920
I know how you can be
employee of the month!

18:13.570 --> 18:15.260
Right this way, please.

18:19.080 --> 18:23.930
Now as you know, the White House
is the seat of presidential power.

18:24.140 --> 18:28.380
The president struggles on a daily
basis with many enormous duties.

18:28.380 --> 18:32.630
Has he tried more
fibre in his diet?

18:33.900 --> 18:38.760
Oliver! Sorry the kids' a
little jet lagged. Carry on.

18:40.330 --> 18:42.530
- Lily, I need to ¡­
- No talking!

18:43.520 --> 18:45.730
Well, I'll promise. But you might
want to get hers in writing.

18:46.490 --> 18:53.050
As I was saying, ur, the first lady 
has many duties of her own, but  they tend to be far less frequent.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.600
Again, my apologies.

18:57.980 --> 19:04.860
Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you
to the Executive Secretary who makes sure the President's duties don't get too backed up.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.150
Oh come on, you did
that one on purpose.

19:15.550 --> 19:19.940
Lily! Come on. Can't we just skip to the
part where you know, you forgive me, and we hug

19:19.980 --> 19:22.860
and that imaginary audience
in my head goes ¡®ohhhh'.

19:22.980 --> 19:25.030
No! You broke a super secret swear.

19:25.230 --> 19:29.370
Not technically. You asked me if I gave
the money to Blabby's dad, I didn't.

19:29.940 --> 19:30.830
I gave it to his mom

19:30.920 --> 19:33.700
Yeah well you broke the
spirit of the stuper secret ¡­

19:34.190 --> 19:35.220
the swooper secret ¡­ the ¡­

19:36.790 --> 19:37.970
you know what I mean!

19:38.430 --> 19:40.250
All clear, checking north corridor.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.590
We are talking about this!

19:46.070 --> 19:47.830
Lily! I only lied because you
wouldn't let me help you.

19:47.940 --> 19:49.980
I didn't want your help and
I didn't want your money.

19:50.070 --> 19:52.620
Yeah but you wanted to be here and now
you are isn't that all that matters?

19:52.660 --> 19:55.540
No! You lied to my face Miley,
how can I trust you again after that?

19:55.610 --> 19:56.800
Has she ever lied to you before?

19:57.050 --> 19:57.620
What?

19:58.140 --> 20:01.550
Jay Demopoulos, reporter for the Boston
Times, does she have a history of lying to you?

20:01.550 --> 20:06.260
Ar no, not really, I think we're in the
wrong room, I'm going to head back to the tour.

20:06.620 --> 20:08.380
Steve Meyer,the Morning Gazette,

20:09.010 --> 20:11.200
you seem like you're running
away from something.

20:13.150 --> 20:16.780
Excellent point Steve.
Care to elaborate on that?

20:17.610 --> 20:20.320
You know, they're all the press,
they have a right to know.

20:20.320 --> 20:24.710
No, Miley, this is private! I mean, they
are very busy people, I'm sure they have better things to do.

20:25.260 --> 20:30.710
Are you joking? We're bored to tears. We've
been waiting for the president for three hours.

20:30.920 --> 20:35.300
So Miley, you believe under certain
circumstances it's OK to lie?

20:36.360 --> 20:39.510
Well ¡­ you're right, they're busy people,
they don't have time for us ¡­

20:39.550 --> 20:42.520
No, no, no, no, like you said, they are
the press, they have a right to know.

20:42.930 --> 20:44.290
Yeah, come on, answer the question!

20:48.420 --> 20:49.720
Tough room!

20:50.550 --> 20:52.510
Alright, listen people,
here's the truth.

20:53.850 --> 20:56.880
She's my best friend.
And she wouldn't let me help her.

20:58.740 --> 21:01.190
Ar¡­ Jay, and then you at the back.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.120
Is it true?
You wouldn't let her help?

21:04.540 --> 21:08.090
Well only because she's always helping
me and I wanted to do this by myself.

21:08.190 --> 21:10.560
If she was really my best friend,
she would've listened.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.490
Lily, that's ¨C

21:14.040 --> 21:17.680
Hey, excuse me, can you guys just hold
on for one second ¡­ we're busy here.

21:21.380 --> 21:25.450
Lily, you're right.
You're not my best friend.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.710
You're more than that,
you're like my sister!

21:29.590 --> 21:31.170
- Really?
- Yes.

21:31.170 --> 21:35.160
And how could I let my sister stay home
when I know there's something I can do to help.

21:36.730 --> 21:37.750
What do you say?

21:38.370 --> 21:40.740
Well, I guess I was being
a little stubborn. I mean,

21:40.910 --> 21:43.550
I guess there's no shame in
taking help from your sister.

21:46.990 --> 21:49.140
Hey!! Just like in my head!

21:57.730 --> 21:58.750
Hiii.

21:58.860 --> 21:59.520
Hey.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.060
You're cute.

22:01.420 --> 22:05.480
Oh no. No, no, no. You definitely
don't want to go there.

22:05.660 --> 22:07.850
Ohhh¡­ playing hard to get.

22:08.140 --> 22:11.620
Seriously. I really think
that you should leave.

22:11.670 --> 22:13.550
And if I don't ¡­. ?

22:18.960 --> 22:20.740
Don't you be flirting with my man.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.220
OK, bye!
