I've never worn mink before.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.239
It's chinchilla.

00:58.274 --> 01:00.441
And it costs $15,000.

01:00.443 --> 01:02.443
How does that make you feel?

01:02.445 --> 01:04.278
Nervous.

01:04.330 --> 01:06.030
You're not supposed to talk.

Just try and make it look like

you're just wearing the fur.

01:47.157 --> 01:48.990
Very good.

Woman:
<i>So, what happened?</i>

03:23.920 --> 03:26.888
Well, no woman, even
living in that shithole,

03:26.923 --> 03:28.973
wants a toaster
for her birthday.

03:29.008 --> 03:31.008
- Can you freshen this?
- Yeah.

03:31.060 --> 03:33.978
And Abigail wasn't shy.

03:34.013 --> 03:36.013
- That's your mother?
- Stepmother.

03:36.065 --> 03:39.400
So she put the toaster
in the middle of the table

03:39.435 --> 03:42.270
and all the boarders come
down for breakfast, see it.

03:42.272 --> 03:44.405
They weren't
particularly impressed.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.108
And every day one of them
would trip over that wire

03:47.110 --> 03:49.443
- and yank it off the table.
- ( women laugh )

03:49.495 --> 03:51.028
Don't go back there.
A lot of roaches.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.447
- Are you surprised?
- Only by the size.

03:53.449 --> 03:54.949
There was one
making a phone call.

03:54.951 --> 03:57.418
- ( laughs )
- Get up, I want my seat back.

03:59.205 --> 04:03.507
Now, toasters were
indestructible back then,

04:03.543 --> 04:05.293
except for the cord,

04:05.295 --> 04:08.012
which was suffering from being yanked
out of the wall every morning.

04:08.047 --> 04:11.015
My Uncle Mack was cheap and
thought he could fix things.

04:11.050 --> 04:14.385
So he wrapped a piece
of copper wire around it.

04:14.437 --> 04:16.470
And, sure enough,
he plugged it in

04:16.522 --> 04:18.522
and it blew him
into the parlor.

04:18.558 --> 04:21.475
- He was unconscious.
- ( laughing )

04:21.476 --> 04:24.111
All the boarders got up,
ran to his aid,

04:24.147 --> 04:25.646
but Abigail didn't move.

04:25.698 --> 04:27.899
She just looked down
at him and said,

04:27.951 --> 04:29.984
- "Happy birthday."
- ( laughing )

04:30.036 --> 04:31.986
Then put the kettle on.

04:31.988 --> 04:34.956
He loves to tell stories
about how poor he was.

04:34.991 --> 04:36.407
But he's not anymore.

04:36.459 --> 04:38.242
Is that your way of saying you
want me to get the check?

04:38.294 --> 04:40.544
Hey, Mildred Pierce,
can I get the check?

04:41.998 --> 04:44.165
- Come on.
- Be polite.

04:44.167 --> 04:46.050
Oh.

04:46.085 --> 04:47.802
Can I get you something else?

04:47.837 --> 04:51.138
No, just the check. And do you
have anything by John Dos Passos?

04:51.174 --> 04:53.891

04:53.927 --> 04:55.810
I'm sorry about my friend.
He's...

04:55.845 --> 04:57.061
Witty.

04:57.096 --> 04:59.063
Do I know you?

04:59.098 --> 05:01.315
I don't think so.

05:04.103 --> 05:06.320
She's a little old for NYU.

05:07.690 --> 05:09.190
$11.60.

05:09.192 --> 05:11.158
You must have had a lot
of hash browns, sweetheart.

05:11.194 --> 05:12.526
Probably only eats once a week.

05:12.578 --> 05:14.028
Let's split it five ways.

05:14.030 --> 05:17.865
No, I think I owe
someone an apology.

05:17.867 --> 05:19.500
That ought to do it.

05:20.536 --> 05:22.670
That's $100.

05:22.705 --> 05:25.373
Well, I suppose I'm gonna
have to drop one of you off.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.124
You decide who.

05:40.690 --> 05:43.140
Don.
Let's go.

Woman:
<i>Good evening, Mr. Draper.</i>

06:00.743 --> 06:02.576
- Who am I speaking with?
- <i> It's Joanne.</i>

06:02.578 --> 06:05.579
<i>You have four messages.</i>
<i>At 7:30, Laura called</i>

06:05.581 --> 06:07.298
<i>and said she has a photo shoot</i>
<i>in the morning,</i>

06:07.333 --> 06:09.000
<i>so don't call</i>
<i>after 11:00.</i>

06:09.052 --> 06:10.885
- What time is it?
- <i> It's 10 past,</i>

06:10.920 --> 06:13.838
<i>but she called again at 8:00</i>
<i>and said midnight was fine.</i>

06:13.890 --> 06:16.424

What else?

06:16.426 --> 06:18.509
<i>9:30, Maxine called.</i>

<i>She met you two weeks ago</i>
<i>at "Cosmopolitan"</i>

<i>and remains intrigued</i>
<i>by your proposition.</i>

<i>And last, at 10:00,</i>
<i>Tricia from TWA.</i>

06:26.486 --> 06:27.935
<i>She's on a layover.</i>

06:27.937 --> 06:29.487
And what are you
doing tonight, Joanne?

06:29.522 --> 06:31.272
<i>You're very funny,</i>
<i>Mr. Draper.</i>

06:33.109 --> 06:35.159
Give me Tricia's number.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.078
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

06:38.197 --> 06:40.164
So glad you could make it.

06:40.199 --> 06:41.665
O'Hare's a mess.

06:41.701 --> 06:44.201
They canceled everything,
so it seemed to be fate.

06:46.122 --> 06:47.838
You look ravishing.

06:47.874 --> 06:50.291
I feel a little underdressed.

06:50.293 --> 06:51.842
Where were you tonight?

07:00.853 --> 07:03.437
( laughing )
No, it's true. On every single flight,

07:03.473 --> 07:07.224
there's always one blanket that's
completely soaked in urine.

07:07.276 --> 07:10.027
- In first class?
- Oh, yes.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.229
( shrieks )

07:12.281 --> 07:15.649
Oh! I'm sorry.

07:15.651 --> 07:18.319
It's your fault.
You scared me.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.037
Do you have a towel?

07:24.327 --> 07:26.994
Don't do that.
( laughing )

07:39.258 --> 07:41.342
Another woman
you're sleeping with?

07:43.062 --> 07:44.929
No, that's the woman
I'm not sleeping with.

07:44.981 --> 07:46.847
My ex-wife.

07:51.687 --> 07:53.737
Hanes calls them L'eggs.

07:55.525 --> 07:57.241
They're crap.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.827
They're definitely not
as high-quality as Topaz.

07:59.862 --> 08:01.612
Well, they're in
four test markets

08:01.664 --> 08:04.365
and they're outspending
you six to one.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.450
And they're outselling
you 20 to one.

08:06.502 --> 08:09.203
It's more than the packaging.
It's the placement.

08:09.205 --> 08:10.871
They're not just selling
them in drug stores.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.706
They're focusing
on supermarkets.

08:12.758 --> 08:14.758
And they're only
$1.39 a pair.

08:14.794 --> 08:17.678
So what, we need to lower our price
and buy more ad time?

08:17.713 --> 08:21.098
This is only a novelty and the inferior
quality will catch up with them.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.267
But we're recommending
a change right now

08:23.302 --> 08:25.186
while it sorts itself out.

08:25.221 --> 08:27.438
Look, I know
you think I'm cheap.

08:27.473 --> 08:29.390
And I know you think
Topaz are cheap--

08:29.442 --> 08:32.308
although, apparently,
not cheap enough--

08:32.361 --> 08:36.313
but I just want to spend money
where it'll make a difference.

08:36.365 --> 08:39.732
They got an egg.
Why don't we have a topaz?

08:39.784 --> 08:41.818
Big plastic jewel.
Green.

08:41.871 --> 08:43.287
Maybe it's see-through.

08:43.322 --> 08:45.072
And Mr. Potato Head
here can relax

08:45.124 --> 08:47.908
'cause he'll still make his
quota when we launch it.

08:47.960 --> 08:51.245
I'd never recommend
imitation as a strategy.

08:51.247 --> 08:54.298
You'll be second,
which is very far from first.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.749
Whose fault is that?

08:55.751 --> 08:58.886
I told you about the
development of this product

08:58.921 --> 09:00.721
and you didn't seem
worried at all.

09:04.093 --> 09:06.477
Art, Marvin,
are you ready for lunch?

09:06.512 --> 09:08.596
Yes, I am, Kenneth.

09:08.648 --> 09:11.732
We had a problem,
but we solved it.

09:14.770 --> 09:17.438
Well, that's great to hear.

09:20.409 --> 09:21.609
What do we do?

09:21.611 --> 09:23.744
We keep the client.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.531
How was the party?

09:27.583 --> 09:29.783
David Bailey wants
to take your picture.

09:29.835 --> 09:32.620
Well, I have plans tonight,

09:32.622 --> 09:35.623
so I'll be leaving at 5:00 on the dot
and I don't want to hear about it.

09:35.625 --> 09:39.426
- Wake me in--
- You have casting in an hour.

09:39.462 --> 09:40.928
Great.

09:50.273 --> 09:51.639
You have lunch plans?

09:51.641 --> 09:54.108
Just coffee
if the wait's not too long.

09:58.614 --> 10:01.815
No, I just thought I'm going
to the coffee shop,

10:01.817 --> 10:03.701
so I could pick
you up something.

10:03.736 --> 10:05.569
Mathis, you're pouring coffee.

10:05.621 --> 10:07.821
I just wanted to ask you
about something.

10:07.823 --> 10:10.124
You want a raise?
Stop acting like a secretary.

10:10.159 --> 10:12.326
This has nothing
to do with work.

10:12.328 --> 10:14.328
My brother-in-law
is in town

10:14.330 --> 10:18.132
and I thought you could
join Julie and I for dinner.

10:18.167 --> 10:21.502
He's very handsome.
The whole family is.

10:21.504 --> 10:24.588
- You're setting me up?
- He has a car.

10:24.640 --> 10:28.475
It's very sweet, but I really have to
question your judgment.

10:28.511 --> 10:30.594
You know, you're a catch.

10:30.646 --> 10:34.682
Thank you, but how could you think
this has nothing to do with work?

10:34.684 --> 10:37.685
I told my wife that and she
said it wouldn't matter

10:37.687 --> 10:39.320
because she has
a knack for this.

10:39.355 --> 10:42.356
What happens if I take
you up on this offer

10:42.408 --> 10:45.326
and it goes badly
or he's homely

10:45.361 --> 10:47.611
or anything happens
good or bad?

10:47.663 --> 10:49.113
Did you think about that?

10:49.165 --> 10:52.082
No, I didn't anticipate
any of this,

10:52.118 --> 10:53.200
I'll be honest with you.

10:53.252 --> 10:56.670
I appreciate it,
but no, thank you.

10:56.706 --> 10:58.505
Tell Julie
she's very thoughtful.

11:06.932 --> 11:08.966
Are you auditioning?

11:09.018 --> 11:10.884
I tried to arrange a meeting,

11:10.886 --> 11:13.721
but Meredith explained
how much work you have to do.

11:17.693 --> 11:21.145
We met with Topaz and had the
unpleasant conversation.

11:21.197 --> 11:25.532
And their solution was a
knockoff topaz container, green.

11:25.568 --> 11:28.068
What was our solution?

11:29.288 --> 11:31.455
We don't have one.

11:31.490 --> 11:34.541
The irony is they're being pushed
out of the bottom of the market.

11:34.577 --> 11:36.377
What's the top of the market,
department stores?

11:36.412 --> 11:38.078
Yeah, but they're
a drug store brand.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.546
That's what Topaz is.

11:41.334 --> 11:44.668
So they're not called
Topaz anymore.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.304
Tell them their idea
for new packaging was good,

11:47.340 --> 11:49.506
but the new packaging
should say Macy's.

11:49.558 --> 11:51.725
That's going to be tough
when department stores

11:51.761 --> 11:54.428
are being blown up by radicals every day.
You know these two.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.230
People haven't
stopped shopping.

11:56.265 --> 11:58.565
So all I have to do
is sign Macy's.

11:58.601 --> 11:59.933
Piece of cake.

12:01.270 --> 12:03.771
Doesn't McCann represent
Marshall Field's?

12:04.940 --> 12:07.191
Remind them
it's a two-way street.

12:11.914 --> 12:13.947
Phil was in plastics
and he's going to metals.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.033
And Greg was in metals
and he's going to

12:16.085 --> 12:18.085
marketing and advertising,
which is my old job.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.037
That means that Tom Schaeffer

12:20.089 --> 12:22.873
is now head of plastics
at Dow Chemical.

12:22.925 --> 12:24.591
Good for him.

12:24.627 --> 12:26.293
Good for you.

12:26.345 --> 12:29.213
Now's a good time.

12:29.265 --> 12:31.215
He's still not up.

12:31.267 --> 12:32.433
Oh.

12:32.468 --> 12:34.101
Never wake a sleeping baby.

12:34.136 --> 12:35.636
I want to see him.

12:37.940 --> 12:40.057
Oh, what's that?

12:40.109 --> 12:42.309
We don't want you to think
of this as retirement,

12:42.311 --> 12:45.229
we want you to think of it as the
beginning of your professional career.

12:45.281 --> 12:47.614
I don't know what to say.

12:47.650 --> 12:49.783
You say, "Jack Nicklaus,
out of my way.

12:49.819 --> 12:51.318
I've got better clubs."

12:51.370 --> 12:53.487
- <i> ( laughs )</i>
- I'm very touched.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.323
Ever since your mother
passed away,

12:56.325 --> 12:59.243
I haven't really
enjoyed anything.

12:59.295 --> 13:02.246
Honestly, Ed.
He thinks he's a comedian.

13:02.298 --> 13:03.547
( chuckles )

13:03.582 --> 13:05.165
I'm just glad there's something

13:05.167 --> 13:07.000
that will get him out of the
house besides that boat.

13:07.002 --> 13:08.669
Who says I'm going
to be in the house?

13:08.671 --> 13:10.587
I've got a lot of time
to make up for.

13:10.639 --> 13:13.006
Daddy, I'm so glad.

13:13.008 --> 13:15.642
I mean, most of the men my age have
had a couple of heart attacks.

13:15.678 --> 13:17.845
I'm still young enough
to enjoy things.

13:17.847 --> 13:19.480
New things, even.

13:19.515 --> 13:21.348
I've started cooking.

13:21.350 --> 13:24.318
Actually made myself a--
what is it, honey?

13:24.353 --> 13:26.520
A Pop-Tart, Ed.

13:26.522 --> 13:28.522
It was very good.

13:32.862 --> 13:34.077
Next.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.113
This is another girl.

13:47.209 --> 13:48.509
Rachel?

14:06.645 --> 14:09.480
I'm supposed to tell you
you missed your flight.

14:09.532 --> 14:11.982
Thank you.

14:16.705 --> 14:17.905
Rachel.

14:19.158 --> 14:20.491
Yes?

14:20.543 --> 14:23.327
You're not just smooth,

14:23.379 --> 14:26.246
you're Wilkinson smooth.

14:30.052 --> 14:31.668
Back to work.

14:40.729 --> 14:42.396
Is it morning?

14:46.435 --> 14:47.985
No.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.903
Go back to sleep.

14:55.027 --> 14:57.361
( TV playing )

15:00.783 --> 15:02.783
Sorry, did I wake you?

15:02.835 --> 15:05.452
It's okay.
Did Eddie wake up again?

15:11.961 --> 15:13.927
My dad is so old.

15:15.130 --> 15:17.130
Don't worry about him.

15:17.132 --> 15:18.849
He is going to have a ball.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.885
Why did he wait
so long to do that?

15:21.937 --> 15:24.021
Honey, he loved his job.

15:24.056 --> 15:26.473
But you don't.

15:26.525 --> 15:29.643
You're bored and angry because
you know in your heart

15:29.695 --> 15:31.111
it's not what you want to do.

15:31.146 --> 15:32.896
I should never
tell you anything.

15:32.948 --> 15:35.616
And I haven't gotten any
writing done in a long time.

15:35.651 --> 15:37.951
So start now.

15:37.987 --> 15:39.820
You've done very well.

15:39.822 --> 15:43.156
And let's stop pretending like
I wasn't born with plenty.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.158
You could quit your job.

15:45.210 --> 15:47.160
We could buy that farm.

15:47.212 --> 15:49.496
You could write your book.

15:49.498 --> 15:51.048
What book?

15:51.083 --> 15:54.835
Something sad and sweet.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.921
For all the people who don't have
the guts to live their dream.

15:57.973 --> 15:59.590
Why don't you write a book?

16:00.976 --> 16:02.593
You gave them your eye.

16:02.645 --> 16:04.344
Don't give them
the rest of your life.

16:04.346 --> 16:07.264
Your father was a cog
in a giant machine

16:07.316 --> 16:08.815
that makes weapons and poison.

16:08.851 --> 16:11.852
- And you sell them.
- <i> ( baby crying )</i>

16:11.854 --> 16:13.820
I'm proud of the company!

16:13.856 --> 16:17.608
And if nothing else, I'd like to
wait and see if I get that raise.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.694
There's always another hurdle.

16:20.696 --> 16:22.863
You're not listening
to me at all!

16:26.035 --> 16:27.951
( sighs )

16:28.003 --> 16:30.754
- You're late.
- It's five after.

16:30.789 --> 16:33.373
Casting always starts on time.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.175
Can't you smell
the cheap perfume?

16:37.546 --> 16:40.130
Can you call Rachel Katz
at Menken's Department Store?

16:40.182 --> 16:42.049
No, you know what?
Set a meeting.

16:42.051 --> 16:43.266
The number's in the Rolodex.

16:43.302 --> 16:44.601
It's regarding Topaz Pantyhose.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.470
Of course.

16:50.559 --> 16:52.776
Well, you're not the
landing party we expected.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.113
What can we do for you?

16:56.148 --> 16:59.116
Well, as I was telling
David here on the phone,

16:59.151 --> 17:01.902
L'eggs Pantyhose
is an unstoppable foe

17:01.904 --> 17:04.488
in the affordable
pantyhose marketplace.

17:04.540 --> 17:07.624
Our client, Topaz Pantyhose,
has the high quality

17:07.660 --> 17:09.742
to wear
a department store name.

17:13.248 --> 17:15.549
It is a growing
and lucrative product.

17:15.584 --> 17:17.968
And in three months,
L'eggs has sold a year's worth.

17:18.002 --> 17:21.471
So they're worried that L'eggs are
gonna spread all over the world?

17:21.507 --> 17:23.223
That wouldn't bother me at all.

17:23.258 --> 17:25.509
( laughing )

17:25.560 --> 17:27.394
We were hoping
that McCann-Erickson

17:27.429 --> 17:30.147
could provide, at the minimum,
an introduction

17:30.182 --> 17:32.099
to your department
store clients

17:32.151 --> 17:34.901
so we can assess their
desire for a store brand.

17:34.937 --> 17:36.820
I know they'd be
happy to meet you.

17:36.855 --> 17:39.740
Especially Dan Higgins.
He loves redheads.

17:41.243 --> 17:42.442
Would you be able to tell him

17:42.494 --> 17:44.861
what's so special
about your panties?

17:44.913 --> 17:47.948
The benefits are listed there.

17:47.950 --> 17:50.200
But, basically,
they're more sheer,

17:50.252 --> 17:53.286
softer, and more
like silk to the touch,

17:53.288 --> 17:54.788
yet still very strong.

17:54.790 --> 17:56.923
So you can pull them
down over and over?

17:56.959 --> 17:58.041
( chuckles )

17:58.093 --> 17:59.509
You can wear them
quite a few times

17:59.545 --> 18:01.678
before they run or lose shape.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.213
Oh.

18:03.265 --> 18:06.433
- Do you wear them, Joan?
- I do.

18:06.468 --> 18:09.052
Well, if you talk to Dan,
I'd start with that.

18:09.104 --> 18:10.604
( laughing )

18:12.307 --> 18:15.142
Well, I think anyone
would be equally interested

18:15.194 --> 18:16.893
in the price-per-unit,

18:16.945 --> 18:19.613
which could be reduced significantly
if the demand were higher.

18:19.648 --> 18:21.732
Why aren't you in
the brassiere business?

18:21.784 --> 18:23.567
Excuse me?

18:23.619 --> 18:26.486
You should be
in the bra business.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.288
You're a work of art.

18:29.658 --> 18:33.160
What she's saying
is that wider distribution

18:33.162 --> 18:35.245
would mean bigger
ad budgets for us.

18:36.715 --> 18:39.332
Well, I'd set a lunch,
but I think a dinner would be better.

18:39.334 --> 18:41.134
And warm him up first.

18:41.170 --> 18:43.336
Send a basket of pears
to Marshall Field's.

18:43.338 --> 18:45.756
The one thing Dan likes
is a nice pear.

18:45.808 --> 18:47.724
( laughs )

18:47.760 --> 18:50.093
This guy.

18:50.145 --> 18:51.511
What are their billings?

18:51.513 --> 18:54.014
If you'd take a look
at the sheet there again...

18:54.016 --> 18:55.732
Oh, yeah.
Give us a minute.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.651
Let's read this thing.

19:08.061 --> 19:09.644
Where were you?

19:09.696 --> 19:11.396
Shirley, you're not
gonna believe this,

19:11.448 --> 19:12.897
but I walked to work today.

19:12.949 --> 19:15.483
Mr. Sterling
and Mr. Donnelly are here.

19:15.535 --> 19:17.118
They just walked in.

19:22.459 --> 19:23.825
You wanted to see me?

19:23.827 --> 19:25.910
You know Ferguson Donnelly
from McCann.

19:25.962 --> 19:27.662
Of course. Ferg.

19:27.664 --> 19:29.297
- Good to see you.
- Been a while.

19:32.669 --> 19:35.503
Is this about the Topaz
department store route?

19:35.505 --> 19:37.088
I think it's a great idea.

19:37.140 --> 19:39.424
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:39.476 --> 19:43.061
Did you send Ed Baxter a $200 set of
MacGregor golf clubs from the firm?

19:43.096 --> 19:44.896
Actually,
I hand-delivered it.

19:44.931 --> 19:46.397
It was a retirement gift.

19:46.433 --> 19:48.816
Huh, well, I've got
some bad news for you.

19:48.852 --> 19:51.102
Pete's gonna take over Dow.

19:51.154 --> 19:52.520
Because of the clubs?

19:52.522 --> 19:55.189
No, because McCann doesn't
want you on the business.

19:55.241 --> 19:57.859
Just because Ed's retiring

19:57.911 --> 20:00.194
doesn't mean I can't get
along with his replacement.

20:00.246 --> 20:01.863
I know Greg from metals.

20:01.865 --> 20:04.365
I don't care if you know
a girl from Kalamazoo.

20:04.417 --> 20:05.867
We don't want you
on the business

20:05.919 --> 20:07.869
because we don't want
you on any business.

20:09.539 --> 20:11.205
Look, Ferg,

20:11.257 --> 20:12.840
you're not still mad
at me for leaving?

20:12.876 --> 20:15.510
That was six years ago.
And you never hired me anyway.

20:15.545 --> 20:18.346
When you bought Puttnam Powell &
Lowe, I came with the furniture.

20:18.381 --> 20:21.215
People come in and out of our
doors all the time, Ken,

20:21.217 --> 20:24.302
but they don't walk out with $4
million of Birds Eye products.

20:24.354 --> 20:26.137
Of course they do.

20:26.189 --> 20:27.855
Fine.

20:27.891 --> 20:30.274
They don't walk around the office
like their shit doesn't stink.

20:30.310 --> 20:32.393
And then go out and tell
the world we're what,

20:32.445 --> 20:34.812
a bunch of black Irish thugs.

20:34.864 --> 20:38.366
So you're gonna fire me because
I hurt Ferg's feelings?

20:38.401 --> 20:40.151
It's what he is.
Look at him.

20:40.203 --> 20:41.903
How about a little dignity?

20:41.955 --> 20:43.237
You're firing me!

20:43.239 --> 20:45.790
Yes, but you're gonna get
a generous severance package

20:45.825 --> 20:47.742
if you help Pete secure
all of your accounts.

20:47.744 --> 20:49.293
Including Dow.

20:49.329 --> 20:51.579
Roger said he'd be glad
to recommend you.

20:51.631 --> 20:55.083
Thank you, Roger.
I appreciate your loyalty.

20:59.506 --> 21:01.556
<i>( door slams )</i>

21:01.591 --> 21:03.391
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

21:09.682 --> 21:11.315
Should we get lunch?

21:11.351 --> 21:14.268
I want to burn this place down.

21:14.270 --> 21:16.904
I know.
They were awful.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.407
But at least we got a yes.

21:19.442 --> 21:21.943
Would you have rather
had a friendly no?

21:21.945 --> 21:24.946
I don't expect you
to understand.

21:24.948 --> 21:29.083
Joan, you've never
experienced that before?

21:29.119 --> 21:31.369
Have you, Peggy?

21:31.421 --> 21:33.921
I don't know.
You can't have it both ways.

21:33.957 --> 21:37.008
- You can't dress the way you do and expect--
- How do I dress?

21:37.043 --> 21:40.128
Look, they didn't take
me seriously, either.

21:40.130 --> 21:42.880
So what you're saying is

21:42.932 --> 21:45.099
I don't dress the way you do

21:45.135 --> 21:48.019
because I don't look like you.

21:48.054 --> 21:51.105
And that's very, very true.

21:52.942 --> 21:56.110
You know what?
You're filthy rich.

21:56.146 --> 21:58.112
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to.

22:00.150 --> 22:01.983
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

22:05.538 --> 22:07.321
How was the cattle call?

22:07.323 --> 22:09.207
We have to have
another session.

22:09.242 --> 22:12.076
You're shameless,
you know that?

22:12.128 --> 22:13.494
Do I have a lunch today?

22:13.496 --> 22:15.963
No, but you have
a busy afternoon.

22:15.999 --> 22:18.666
Oh, I scheduled
a meeting next Monday

22:18.668 --> 22:21.002
with Mr. Rosenthal at
Menken's Department Store.

22:21.054 --> 22:23.671
Mrs. Katz didn't
want to meet?

22:23.673 --> 22:27.642
Well, it was a very
awkward conversation

22:27.677 --> 22:30.728
because apparently she stepped
down a few months ago

22:30.763 --> 22:33.097
and passed away last week.

22:34.350 --> 22:35.650
What?

22:37.020 --> 22:38.769
Rachel Katz?

22:38.822 --> 22:40.855
Yes.

22:40.857 --> 22:43.157
Well, I'm sorry
to tell you that.

22:43.193 --> 22:45.776
Last week?

22:52.452 --> 22:55.620
I had no intention
of upsetting you.

22:55.672 --> 22:57.338
How old was she?

22:59.425 --> 23:01.926
I don't know.
Younger than me.

23:01.961 --> 23:06.047
From the name I just
pictured some old lady.

23:06.049 --> 23:08.049
I had no idea.

23:12.472 --> 23:15.306
If you'd like, they've asked
that in lieu of flowers,

23:15.358 --> 23:18.943
you can send a donation to the
National Jewish Hospital at Denver.

23:18.978 --> 23:20.561
Do you want to do that?

23:23.283 --> 23:25.066
No.

23:25.118 --> 23:27.034
Yes, sure.

23:28.988 --> 23:31.455
I'm going to run down
and get you a sandwich.

23:35.078 --> 23:36.878
<i>( door closes )</i>

23:38.248 --> 23:40.081

23:40.083 --> 23:42.133
I'm shoving off.
Need anything else?

23:42.168 --> 23:43.584
No.

23:45.588 --> 23:47.805
Ahem, Mathis.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.507
Yes?

23:49.559 --> 23:53.728
Well, if it helps you get back
into your wife's good graces,

23:53.763 --> 23:55.763
I had a cancellation

23:55.815 --> 23:58.349
and I'd love to join you
for dinner tomorrow night.

23:58.401 --> 24:00.768
Shoot, we already
made other plans.

24:00.820 --> 24:03.070
Oh.

24:03.106 --> 24:06.774
Well, it wasn't meant to be.

24:06.826 --> 24:09.527
Stevie doesn't need to come with us.
I'll sell his ticket.

24:09.579 --> 24:11.445
Stevie?
How old is he?

24:11.497 --> 24:13.080
I don't know, 30?

24:15.001 --> 24:17.868
- I don't know.
- Ugh, can I go?

24:17.921 --> 24:21.172
Give him my number.
Tell him to call me.

24:21.207 --> 24:22.790
Okay.

24:37.523 --> 24:40.107
- You want a menu?
- Just coffee.

24:40.143 --> 24:41.809
And could you get
her attention for me?

24:41.861 --> 24:45.279
Di, just coffee for him.

24:53.156 --> 24:55.623
Evening.

24:55.658 --> 24:57.491
Can I help you?

24:57.493 --> 25:00.795
You look so familiar to me.

25:00.830 --> 25:02.747
Do I know you from somewhere?

25:02.799 --> 25:05.249
Yes, from here.
The other night.

25:05.301 --> 25:07.168
No.

25:07.170 --> 25:09.337
I think I know you.

25:09.339 --> 25:12.757
You don't need a line.
I know why you're here.

25:12.809 --> 25:15.476
And it's not for
a cup of coffee.

25:18.564 --> 25:20.848
Vi, I'm taking my break.

25:48.544 --> 25:50.344
My name is Don.

26:52.658 --> 26:55.693
Excuse me, miss.

26:55.745 --> 26:57.862
When are you done here?

26:57.914 --> 27:00.414
You got your $100's worth.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.032
You can go.

27:09.999 --> 27:12.800
- Woman: Have fun last night?
- Woman #2: Yes, I did.

27:12.835 --> 27:16.136
He's very handsome,
I'll tell you that much.

27:16.172 --> 27:18.389
Ken:
<i>Don. Don.</i>

27:24.814 --> 27:27.681
- Are you okay?
- I'm done.

27:29.018 --> 27:31.151
McCann told Roger to do it.

27:31.187 --> 27:32.937
And, boy, did Roger do it.

27:32.989 --> 27:36.023
They want me to giftwrap all my
accounts and give them to Pete.

27:36.025 --> 27:38.325
I'm calling Jim Hobart
right now.

27:38.361 --> 27:40.361
You're the head of accounts.

27:40.413 --> 27:43.280
Do you want to hear
something spooky?

27:43.332 --> 27:45.783
Don't do anything rash, Ken.

27:45.835 --> 27:46.917
It's just a job.

27:46.953 --> 27:49.920
No, my father-in-law
retires

27:49.956 --> 27:52.206
and my wife says,
"I want you to quit.

27:52.258 --> 27:55.592
You're wasting your life.
You should write that novel."

27:55.628 --> 27:57.544
And you know what?

27:57.596 --> 27:59.213
I think I was gonna do it.

27:59.265 --> 28:02.549
And the very next day,
they fire me.

28:02.551 --> 28:04.518
Can you believe that?

28:05.638 --> 28:06.687
No.

28:06.722 --> 28:08.605
That's not a coincidence.

28:08.641 --> 28:10.107
That's a sign.

28:10.142 --> 28:12.026
Of what?

28:12.061 --> 28:13.894
The life not lived.

28:17.700 --> 28:18.866
So that's good?

28:18.901 --> 28:22.403
( laughs )
Yeah. It's great.

28:23.572 --> 28:25.072
Now I just have to figure out

28:25.124 --> 28:27.157
how to drag myself
through those doors.

28:36.502 --> 28:40.254
Woman: <i> Joan, you have</i>
<i>a call from Dennis.</i>

28:40.256 --> 28:42.723
- Dennis who?
- <i> I'm not sure.</i>

28:42.758 --> 28:45.809
<i>His girl just said Dennis.</i>
<i>He's at McCann-Erickson.</i>

28:47.897 --> 28:49.980
It's Dennis Ford.

28:50.016 --> 28:52.066
<i>Should I put him through?</i>

28:53.986 --> 28:55.486
No.

28:55.521 --> 28:57.354
Tell him I'm in a meeting.

29:10.453 --> 29:12.002
So Clara just left?

29:12.038 --> 29:14.171
She was as big as a house.

29:14.206 --> 29:16.256
Is Torkelson going
to marry her?

29:16.292 --> 29:18.959
He's probably just
looking the other way.

29:18.961 --> 29:21.295
People do that around
here all the time.

29:21.297 --> 29:23.630
I swear I found out
after you did.

29:23.682 --> 29:25.299
It came from McCann.

29:25.301 --> 29:27.134
So did your millions
of dollars.

29:27.136 --> 29:31.138
( sighs ) You know, I didn't
really get millions of dollars.

29:31.140 --> 29:33.057
I mean, eventually,

29:33.109 --> 29:35.059
but stepped out
in smaller increments

29:35.111 --> 29:37.144
to stay under that
top tax threshold.

29:37.146 --> 29:39.446
I might have to buy an apartment
building to hold onto any of it.

29:39.482 --> 29:40.981
And then I've got
to be a landlord.

29:42.485 --> 29:44.151
Sounds like a real
pain in the ass.

29:44.153 --> 29:47.121
Look, I was caught by surprise.

29:47.156 --> 29:49.540
But I didn't know
your history with McCann.

29:49.575 --> 29:51.158
What did you do over there?

29:52.828 --> 29:54.995
I never fit in.
I'm not Irish.

29:55.047 --> 29:56.914
I'm not Catholic.
I can read.

29:56.966 --> 30:00.050
( laughs )
Well, it's good you're playing ball

30:00.086 --> 30:01.552
or you'd have no future.

30:01.587 --> 30:03.170
In advertising maybe.

30:03.172 --> 30:04.838
You have other plans?

30:04.840 --> 30:08.392
Well, I may have
let it go for a while,

30:08.427 --> 30:12.096
but damned if I don't have
something to write about now.

30:12.148 --> 30:14.815
No, this world is boring.

30:14.850 --> 30:16.600
You should write
an adventure story.

30:16.652 --> 30:20.187
I mean, do you know how great
you're gonna look on a book jacket?

30:20.189 --> 30:22.940
I've thought about it.

30:22.992 --> 30:25.659
I'm a hell of a lot better
at it than I ever was at this.

30:25.694 --> 30:28.028
( chuckles )
Good for you.

30:28.030 --> 30:29.997
I'm envious.

30:30.032 --> 30:33.867
I thought I was really changing my
life when I went out to California.

30:33.869 --> 30:36.837
Of course, now it sort
of feels like a dream.

30:36.872 --> 30:39.256
But at the time,
it felt so real.

30:39.291 --> 30:42.459
Well, that's you, I guess.

30:42.511 --> 30:45.045
I know.
Look, here I am.

30:45.047 --> 30:46.847
And you know what?

30:46.882 --> 30:48.348
If you get tired
of the writing,

30:48.384 --> 30:49.967
I hope you know
you can always use my name.

30:50.019 --> 30:51.852
I have nothing but good
things to say about you.

30:53.355 --> 30:55.556
I appreciate that.

30:55.558 --> 30:58.058
Jesus, Fillmore Auto Parts?

30:58.060 --> 31:00.444
You trying to give me stuff
we don't even have anymore?

31:21.717 --> 31:23.584
This is the same
as the navy one.

31:23.636 --> 31:25.419
Well, don't tell
Oscar de la Renta

31:25.471 --> 31:28.172
because the navy one is $159.

31:28.224 --> 31:30.174
I can wear boots with that.

31:30.226 --> 31:33.677
You know what?
I'll take the boots

31:33.729 --> 31:35.596
and the tan heels,

31:35.648 --> 31:38.148
the chiffon, the red,

31:38.184 --> 31:39.900
and this one.

31:41.737 --> 31:43.237
Didn't you used to work here?

31:43.272 --> 31:45.939
Because you can probably
still get the discount.

31:45.941 --> 31:48.025
That's tempting,

31:48.077 --> 31:51.161
but I think you have me
confused with someone else.

31:51.197 --> 31:53.030
Could you?

31:59.622 --> 32:02.422
- <i> ( intercom buzzes )</i>
- Meredith: <i> Ted wants to see you.</i>

32:05.678 --> 32:07.177
Send him in.

32:08.547 --> 32:10.464
Just got off the phone
with Wilkinson.

32:10.466 --> 32:12.466
They've narrowed it
down to three girls.

32:12.518 --> 32:13.967
They want me to send
over the binder,

32:14.019 --> 32:16.353
but there's 120
Polaroids in here.

32:16.388 --> 32:17.938
It's just gonna
make things worse.

32:17.973 --> 32:19.690
What can I say?
They're perverts. They love casting.

32:19.725 --> 32:23.193
They can't decide?
Use them all.

32:23.229 --> 32:26.530
There are three women
in every man's life.

32:29.318 --> 32:31.068
You did not just think that up.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.819
Fine, I've had it for years,

32:32.871 --> 32:34.321
but I really think
it works here.

32:34.323 --> 32:36.957
You'd rather find new creative
than pick a girl?

32:36.992 --> 32:40.210
Speaking of which, "Vogue" is throwing
a party in the Village tonight.

32:40.246 --> 32:42.212
Cocktails at my apartment.
It's right around the corner.

32:42.248 --> 32:44.965
Apparently, hemlines
are going up.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.833
What time?

32:46.835 --> 32:49.803
- I'm leaving now.
- Okay.

32:54.810 --> 32:56.810
<i>( door closes )</i>

32:56.845 --> 32:58.679
So, you're from Atlanta?

32:58.681 --> 33:00.397
No, I just went
to school there.

33:00.432 --> 33:02.516
Emory, it's the only
game in town.

33:02.518 --> 33:03.734
How about you?

33:03.769 --> 33:06.653
Me? Oh, no.
I didn't go to college.

33:06.689 --> 33:09.156
I went right to work.
I was a secretary.

33:09.191 --> 33:11.241
That's interesting.

33:11.277 --> 33:12.826
Is it?

33:14.947 --> 33:16.196
Ah, here we go.

33:19.168 --> 33:20.701
Oh, this smells delicious.

33:22.037 --> 33:23.954
It does.

33:24.006 --> 33:26.006
Didn't you order lasagna?

33:26.041 --> 33:27.958
This is just as good.

33:29.595 --> 33:32.262
Do you want my cannelloni?
It's like lasagna.

33:32.298 --> 33:34.548
More than veal, anyway.

33:34.550 --> 33:36.383
Are you trying to make
this more complicated?

33:36.435 --> 33:39.436
I don't know why you're eating
something you didn't order.

33:39.471 --> 33:40.721
Do you like veal?

33:40.723 --> 33:42.306
What am I supposed to do?

33:42.358 --> 33:44.107
Send it back
like a prima donna?

33:44.143 --> 33:46.810
So you're just gonna eat
someone else's dinner?

33:46.862 --> 33:50.480
So I can either be a jerk
and send it back,

33:50.532 --> 33:52.149
or eat it and look weak.

33:54.737 --> 33:56.203
I don't want this to get cold.

33:56.238 --> 33:58.238
( sighs )

33:58.290 --> 34:01.541
Johnny said you were the kind of
girl who doesn't put up with things.

34:01.577 --> 34:03.210
Really?

34:04.630 --> 34:06.496
What else did Mathis say?

34:08.801 --> 34:11.418
He said you were funny.

34:11.469 --> 34:13.469
And that you were fearless.

34:22.848 --> 34:24.563
I love veal.

34:30.272 --> 34:31.737
( sighs )

34:46.386 --> 34:49.387
<i>( quiet chatter )</i>

35:01.534 --> 35:03.150
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

35:03.202 --> 35:04.702
Should I take my shoes off?

35:04.737 --> 35:07.238
No, that's just
for the mourners.

35:07.240 --> 35:09.740
I just wanted
to pay my respects.

35:09.742 --> 35:11.242
I worked with Rachel.

35:11.244 --> 35:12.910
At the store?

35:12.912 --> 35:14.495
I'm Barbara, her sister.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.747
I'm Don Draper.
I'm in advertising.

35:18.918 --> 35:20.418
Oh.

35:20.470 --> 35:22.420
I know who you are.

35:24.090 --> 35:25.840
Excuse me, do you mind?

35:25.892 --> 35:27.425
We need one more
for our minyan.

35:27.427 --> 35:28.926
I'd be glad to help.

35:28.928 --> 35:31.345
He can't.
He's not Jewish.

35:31.397 --> 35:34.598
Okay.
I'll go and knock on some doors.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.851
You shouldn't do it.
Let one of them do it.

35:36.903 --> 35:38.769
Barbara, they're my neighbors.

35:42.024 --> 35:43.574
We're sitting shiva.

35:43.609 --> 35:47.078
It's a seven-day memorial
period after the funeral.

35:47.113 --> 35:49.330
I've lived in New York
a long time.

35:49.365 --> 35:50.915
I brought cake.

35:52.618 --> 35:54.118
You did.

35:57.457 --> 36:00.091
So, how is your family?

36:02.178 --> 36:04.712
I got divorced.

36:04.764 --> 36:07.298
And I got remarried, actually.

36:07.300 --> 36:08.799
You left your wife for her?

36:08.801 --> 36:11.635
No, it didn't
work out that way.

36:13.272 --> 36:15.556
I'm actually getting
divorced again.

36:17.143 --> 36:18.692
I'm sorry.

36:24.117 --> 36:25.816
Are those her children?

36:27.153 --> 36:28.953
Yes.

36:28.988 --> 36:31.489
When's the last time
you spoke to her?

36:32.492 --> 36:34.158
Years ago.
Before them.

36:38.498 --> 36:40.131
What happened to her?

36:41.751 --> 36:44.001
She had leukemia.

36:53.062 --> 36:56.430
I'm sorry. I don't know what
you're looking for here.

36:56.482 --> 36:59.483
I guess I just wanted to find out
what was happening in her life.

36:59.519 --> 37:02.686
She lived the life
she wanted to live.

37:02.738 --> 37:05.022
She had everything.

37:06.692 --> 37:09.160
Good.

37:09.195 --> 37:11.195
I have to help.
I'm sorry.

37:17.036 --> 37:19.370
( speaking Hebrew )

37:34.387 --> 37:36.470
Johnny Mathis.

37:36.522 --> 37:38.722
How many times has he shown up

37:38.724 --> 37:41.559
and people have been
disappointed?

37:41.611 --> 37:43.444
"You are not
Johnny Mathis."

37:43.479 --> 37:45.813
( laughing )
I've never thought of that.

37:47.450 --> 37:49.567
You don't seem like a lawyer.

37:49.619 --> 37:52.536
Well, I just left
a firm in Boston

37:52.572 --> 37:54.071
because they felt the same way.

37:56.409 --> 38:00.244
I once quit a job because
I wanted to go to Paris.

38:00.246 --> 38:02.379
Do they do that in advertising?

38:02.415 --> 38:06.133
Sure. We shoot commercials
abroad all the time.

38:06.168 --> 38:07.918
Well, some people do.

38:07.920 --> 38:11.255
So all you have to do
is write something in Paris

38:11.307 --> 38:12.923
and you can go.
Am I wrong?

38:12.925 --> 38:16.510
Yes. That's not
how it works.

38:16.562 --> 38:18.729
Well, next vacation.

38:21.851 --> 38:24.101
I haven't taken a vacation...

38:25.438 --> 38:27.271
well, never.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.443
You know what?
Let's go.

38:32.495 --> 38:34.662
Sure. Where?

38:34.697 --> 38:37.248
To Paris.

38:37.283 --> 38:38.949
Let's go to Paris.

38:38.951 --> 38:40.534
Right now.

38:43.923 --> 38:45.422
You think you're
kidding around,

38:45.458 --> 38:48.259
- but I don't have a job.
- I'm not kidding.

38:49.462 --> 38:51.679
Okay. I'm getting
the check.

38:51.714 --> 38:53.464
And I'm getting my coat.

38:56.602 --> 38:59.219
( laughing )

39:00.640 --> 39:02.473
I can't find it.

39:02.475 --> 39:04.275
I've never actually used it.

39:04.310 --> 39:06.226
You've never used
your passport?

39:19.292 --> 39:21.792
- Stop.
- What? Why?

39:21.827 --> 39:23.744
Flight's not till 6:00.

39:23.796 --> 39:25.296
I hate to disappoint you,

39:25.331 --> 39:26.880
but I don't need
that much time.

39:26.916 --> 39:28.716
( laughs )

39:30.886 --> 39:32.886
I can't believe this.

39:32.922 --> 39:35.172
I can't find my passport.

39:36.509 --> 39:39.059
It's okay.
This is a romantic spot.

39:40.846 --> 39:43.180
Stevie.

39:43.182 --> 39:45.316
( sighs )
I'm sorry,

39:45.351 --> 39:47.818
but what were we
going to do in Paris?

39:49.355 --> 39:51.522
I thought you were a fling,

39:51.524 --> 39:56.160
but now I think
maybe you're more.

39:56.195 --> 39:59.163
I don't want to sleep with you
on the night we first met.

39:59.198 --> 40:01.198
That's so old-fashioned.

40:02.835 --> 40:05.536
I've tried new-fashioned.

40:05.538 --> 40:07.204
( sighs )

40:07.206 --> 40:08.872
Well, if I have to go
back to Boston...

40:08.924 --> 40:10.457
I don't even know
if I'm going to get this job.

40:10.509 --> 40:14.511
Don't you worry.
I am going to find that passport.

40:14.547 --> 40:17.464
We can go next weekend.

40:17.516 --> 40:21.135
I have an interview
in DC next weekend.

40:21.187 --> 40:22.853
How about the weekend after?

40:22.888 --> 40:24.555
Perfect.

40:26.809 --> 40:28.559
You really want me to go now?

40:31.480 --> 40:33.897
Just call me when you
get back from DC.

40:41.957 --> 40:43.323
I will.

40:43.376 --> 40:45.075
Good.

40:56.088 --> 40:58.088
( laughs )

40:59.592 --> 41:01.675

41:12.165 --> 41:15.266
<i>10 days ago with my report to</i>
<i>the nation on Vietnam,</i>

41:15.368 --> 41:17.635
I announced the decision
to withdraw

41:17.737 --> 41:20.304
an additional 150,000 Americans

41:20.406 --> 41:23.040
from Vietnam
over the next year.

41:23.143 --> 41:27.245
<i>I said then that I was</i>

41:27.347 --> 41:31.282

41:38.091 --> 41:40.124
<i>( horns honking )</i>

41:50.302 --> 41:52.052
I've secured Birds Eye.

41:52.104 --> 41:54.054
I think Ferguson Donnelly
is one happy man.

41:54.106 --> 41:56.139
More like a man and a half.

41:56.141 --> 41:59.810
As my father would say, he
really puts the mick in McCann.

41:59.862 --> 42:02.896
- <i> ( intercom buzzes )</i>
- Woman: <i> Ken's here for the meeting.</i>

42:02.948 --> 42:05.566
- Did you invite him?
- To this meeting?

42:06.785 --> 42:08.569
Oh, hello, Pete.

42:08.621 --> 42:11.822
Roger, I just wanted to let you know
I won't be collecting severance.

42:11.874 --> 42:14.658
You got another job?
Good for you.

42:14.710 --> 42:16.076
But you're still entitled.

42:16.128 --> 42:17.828
It wouldn't be right.

42:17.830 --> 42:20.831
My signing bonus from Dow is so big,
it feels like a second helping.

42:22.835 --> 42:24.334
What the hell
are you talking about?

42:24.386 --> 42:27.304
See, I wasn't just
Ed's son-in-law.

42:27.339 --> 42:29.673
They actually value
their relationships.

42:29.675 --> 42:32.059
Well, I suppose they need
a guy in fertilizer.

42:32.094 --> 42:35.262
( chuckles )
I'm taking Tom Schaeffer's old post.

42:35.314 --> 42:36.647
Head of advertising.

42:38.434 --> 42:40.400
So you're going to fire us?

42:40.436 --> 42:43.270
No, it's going to be
way worse than that.

42:43.322 --> 42:45.188
I'm going to be your client.

42:45.241 --> 42:48.492
And I hate to tell you,
but I'm very hard to please.

42:50.946 --> 42:53.030
Until we meet again.

42:58.037 --> 43:00.037
Shit.

43:11.216 --> 43:14.051
Taking Fleischmann's
Margarine to the studio.

43:14.103 --> 43:15.719
If you want changes,
we got to talk now.

43:15.721 --> 43:17.721
Sure, fine, just
keep your voice down.

43:17.773 --> 43:20.057
I commandeered these.

43:20.059 --> 43:22.643
Sounds like you had
quite a night.

43:22.695 --> 43:23.977
It was nice.

43:24.029 --> 43:25.729
With who?

43:25.731 --> 43:27.948
She's going to Europe
with my brother-in-law.

43:27.983 --> 43:30.284
You know, Julie and I went
to Paris on our honeymoon

43:30.319 --> 43:31.735
if you need any
recommendations.

43:31.737 --> 43:34.738
I don't know where I'm going,
but you have work to do.

43:37.910 --> 43:40.661
( fizzing )

43:40.713 --> 43:42.913
Paris, huh?

43:42.915 --> 43:44.798
Where margarine was invented.

43:44.833 --> 43:46.583
Wow.

43:46.585 --> 43:48.669
First date magic.

43:48.721 --> 43:50.671
I had too much wine

43:50.723 --> 43:53.056
and I totally
embarrassed myself.

43:53.092 --> 43:55.225
Sounds like you
had a good time.

43:55.260 --> 43:58.395
I'm not going to get on a plane
with somebody I barely know.

43:58.430 --> 44:01.598
But you'd get to know him.
Sounds like fun.

44:01.600 --> 44:03.350
( sighs )

44:03.402 --> 44:05.652
It's nothing a couple
of Aspirin won't fix.

44:15.114 --> 44:17.164
Meredith, I'm leaving
for the day.

44:22.454 --> 44:24.788
I got a little research
for your meeting.

44:24.840 --> 44:27.290
Mr. Rosenthal is first
thing Monday morning.

44:27.292 --> 44:29.626
- Who?
- Mr. Rosenthal.

44:29.628 --> 44:32.129
From Menken's Department Store.

44:32.131 --> 44:33.714
Pantyhose.

44:37.219 --> 44:38.552
Thank you.

45:03.912 --> 45:05.962
I've got this.

45:05.998 --> 45:07.631
Hello.

45:07.666 --> 45:09.416
I don't know why you're here,

45:09.468 --> 45:10.917
but that's not
going to happen again.

45:10.969 --> 45:13.503
Wait.

45:13.505 --> 45:15.005
What?

45:16.675 --> 45:19.059
I...

45:19.094 --> 45:22.646
had this dream about
a woman I once knew.

45:24.183 --> 45:27.350
And I found out the next
day she had just died.

45:29.021 --> 45:31.354
Is that who you think I am?

45:32.524 --> 45:34.825
No, I don't think so.

45:34.860 --> 45:37.327
Well, I want you
to think very carefully

45:37.362 --> 45:38.829
about when you
really had that dream,

45:38.864 --> 45:41.948
because when people die,
everything gets mixed up.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.701
I don't know.
Maybe.

45:44.703 --> 45:47.671
Maybe you dreamt
about her all the time.

45:48.957 --> 45:50.874
Maybe.

45:50.876 --> 45:54.544
When someone dies, you just
want to make sense out of it.

45:54.596 --> 45:57.047
But you can't.

46:01.603 --> 46:04.888
I'm not saying this to lead you
on or make you more interested,

46:04.940 --> 46:07.474
but the next time you come in
here, please bring a date.

46:08.944 --> 46:10.777
I just work here.

46:12.114 --> 46:14.231
I just want to sit here.

46:19.121 --> 46:21.371
Okay.
