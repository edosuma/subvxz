three different sets put together.

16:53.215 --> 16:55.048
- This is it.
- This is it?

16:55.049 --> 16:57.783
This is awful that MEGO tried
to pass this off as a Batcave.

16:57.786 --> 16:59.552
What are you talking about?
I mean, tell me this doesn't

16:59.553 --> 17:01.955
look just like Batman's
Batcave from the comics.

17:01.956 --> 17:04.490
It does not look anything
like Batman's Batcave.

17:04.492 --> 17:07.059
I'm not sure why you're
so... Mike, please step in.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.395
This was the Batcave.
This was headquarters.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.998
This is where Batman and Robin
would go to the Batcomputer

17:12.000 --> 17:14.901
and find out where the Joker
was planning his next crime.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.769
- Ugh... this? This...
- Yeah.

17:16.771 --> 17:17.903
Looks like it's his record
collection, doesn't it?

17:17.905 --> 17:19.471
[laughter]

17:19.473 --> 17:21.508
This is the ultimate
crime fighting computer.

17:21.509 --> 17:23.175
What's that? Is that supposed
to be the Joker right there?

17:23.178 --> 17:25.444
I gotta argue in his defense.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.846
It looks like one of
those Chinese ghost cities

17:27.848 --> 17:30.650
that they built where there's, like,
nothing inside the buildings..

17:30.652 --> 17:32.519
[laughter]

17:32.520 --> 17:36.923
Oh, the MEGO Batcave was my
unrequited love of childhood.

17:36.924 --> 17:39.526
It was a glorious... you
know, in my child's mind...

17:39.528 --> 17:42.194
A gloriously large play set

17:42.197 --> 17:44.530
that unfolded with the secret entrance.

17:44.532 --> 17:46.499
There was a computer.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.867
Are we talking about the
same MEGO Batcave here?

17:48.869 --> 17:51.104
Because what I saw...
It looked like garbage.

17:51.105 --> 17:52.439
I'm going to be honest.

17:52.441 --> 17:54.941
It... it... the floor of the Batcave,

17:54.942 --> 17:57.810
if you remember correctly,
was a piece of square plastic.

17:57.813 --> 18:00.512
- Yes!
- Looked like it came off of a pool liner.

18:00.515 --> 18:01.847
He crapped all over
this, this man's Bat...

18:01.849 --> 18:03.516
Did you really?

18:03.518 --> 18:05.884
This toy is part of our
comic book heritage, man.

18:05.886 --> 18:08.621
- He treated it like a toilet.
- It looked like a toilet.

18:08.623 --> 18:10.155
Oh, my God, dude!

18:10.157 --> 18:11.891
I want to cast you out of the temple.

18:11.893 --> 18:13.460
This is crazy!

18:13.461 --> 18:15.694
I was in agreement
with Ming on this one.

18:15.696 --> 18:17.230
- No!
- Yeah.

18:17.231 --> 18:18.498
Why do you love Megos?

18:18.500 --> 18:20.467
This is a big part of my childhood.

18:20.469 --> 18:22.335
I'm almost 50 years old, and
I get to play with this stuff?

18:22.336 --> 18:24.503
I mean, it's like... pffff! It's great.

18:24.506 --> 18:25.838
- Tell me this...
- I love it.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.207
These are so rare.

18:27.209 --> 18:30.175
Oh, especially the Bat Signal.
Probably the rarest part in here, you know.

18:30.178 --> 18:31.411
What was really cool about the light...

18:31.413 --> 18:34.213
It was more than just a, you know,
a flashlight bulb in there.

18:34.215 --> 18:36.383
Check this out... you gotta
check out the Bat Signal.

18:36.384 --> 18:37.884
Oh, yeah. Get it closer.

18:37.885 --> 18:39.685
Ah, in your face.

18:39.688 --> 18:41.921
- Wow, look at that.
- In your face.

18:41.923 --> 18:44.356
You gotta admit it's pretty bare-bones.

18:44.358 --> 18:46.393
Being a child of the '70s,
you got to appreciate that.

18:46.394 --> 18:48.161
Why was it bare-bones?

18:48.163 --> 18:50.262
We didn't need anything,
man, 'cause we had this.

18:50.265 --> 18:51.498
- Pffft!
- Right?

18:51.500 --> 18:53.199
- Imagination.
- We had this.

18:53.201 --> 18:55.367
We didn't need... we didn't
need a nice, fancy sculpture.

18:55.369 --> 18:58.404
All we needed was the
vinyl, a piece of wood,

18:58.406 --> 19:01.374
and a piece of plastic
that you shove a battery in

19:01.375 --> 19:03.542
and a little tiny light comes
out, and we had the Batcave.

19:03.545 --> 19:05.744
Hold on, if that were the
case, why even need this then?

19:05.747 --> 19:07.413
Yeah, you could definitely imagine this.

19:07.415 --> 19:10.282
[laughter]

19:10.285 --> 19:11.851
You guys talk about imagination.

19:11.853 --> 19:14.354
The kicker, for me...
It was the Bat Signal.

19:14.355 --> 19:17.089
Spelled in lowercase letters,
it said "bat signal" on it.

19:17.092 --> 19:19.959
Where's the imagination in that?

19:19.961 --> 19:21.861
You're talking like a kid that grew up

19:21.863 --> 19:24.063
with those giant G.I. Joe monstrosities.

19:24.065 --> 19:27.066
Just because it has a lot of
detail doesn't mean it's better.

19:27.067 --> 19:29.635
Yes, it doesn't... you have
to be right next to a wall

19:29.637 --> 19:31.203
in order for it to work,

19:31.205 --> 19:33.239
but in your imagination,
once you press that,

19:33.240 --> 19:35.974
you are Commissioner
Gordon summoning the Batman.

19:35.977 --> 19:38.144
You're in charge. You're
building the adventure.

19:38.145 --> 19:39.645
You're not just sitting
there going like,

19:39.647 --> 19:41.480
"It looks exactly like it.

19:41.482 --> 19:43.415
Now I'll just sit here
and wait till I'm dead ."

19:43.417 --> 19:45.451
[laughter]

19:45.453 --> 19:47.119
All right, and... And you're selling it

19:47.122 --> 19:49.255
because it's awful, right?
You wanna get rid of it?

19:49.257 --> 19:50.289
- [laughs]
- No, no!

19:50.291 --> 19:51.557
This is part of my childhood.

19:51.559 --> 19:53.259
This is the cool stuff.

19:53.260 --> 19:56.462
Obviously, I mean, me
and Mike appreciate it.

19:56.464 --> 19:58.431
These two may not, but I... we do.

19:58.432 --> 20:00.799
What do you need for it?

20:00.801 --> 20:02.868
I'd like to do, like, $125 on it.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.573
Hmm.

20:06.575 --> 20:08.208
Would you be willing to take...

20:09.943 --> 20:11.978
$75?

20:11.980 --> 20:13.313
Hmm.

20:13.315 --> 20:14.614
How 'bout $100?

20:16.851 --> 20:18.351
Working Bat Signal.

20:18.353 --> 20:22.454
<i>[light music]</i>

20:22.457 --> 20:24.190
- Done. 100 bucks.
- Right on.

20:24.192 --> 20:25.692
All right.

20:25.693 --> 20:27.993
♪ ♪

20:27.996 --> 20:29.695
- Appreciate it.
- All right. Thanks, guys.

20:29.698 --> 20:30.963
All right, man. Have a great day.

20:30.965 --> 20:32.499
You, too. Thanks.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.488
After 40 years, Santa
finally comes through.

20:36.932 --> 20:38.756
It was on the bucket
list, and now I don't...

20:38.912 --> 20:40.205
Now I can cross it off.

20:40.208 --> 20:42.674
I just... is there anything you
didn't put on your bucket list

20:42.676 --> 20:44.009
if that piece of crap is on there?

20:44.011 --> 20:45.811
[laughter] Jesus!

20:45.814 --> 20:48.213
Oh, ma That's all the
time we got for this week.

20:48.215 --> 20:50.717
We gotta go. For "Comic
Book Men", I'm Kevin Smith.

20:50.719 --> 20:52.618
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:52.621 --> 20:53.987
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:53.989 --> 20:55.622
Always stay positive, kids.

20:55.624 --> 20:57.824
Even in the negatiti zone. Good night.
