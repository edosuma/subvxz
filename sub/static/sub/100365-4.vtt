08:46.652 --> 08:48.779
Excuse me. Hi.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.367
I'm so sorry. Where do I check in--

08:55.369 --> 08:56.870
Yeah. Got it.

18:09.047 --> 18:13.468
It's the clapper. The clapper.
It's the clapper! How dumb can you be?

18:22.394 --> 18:24.813
I am not the problem.

19:55.946 --> 19:56.989
Hi.

19:58.991 --> 20:00.409
Oh, hungry.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.205
I'm a Sno Ball gal myself.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.332
Ever have the pink ones?

20:08.083 --> 20:09.251
So good.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.380
You guys from around here?

20:19.052 --> 20:20.470
It's 4.18.

21:44.763 --> 21:46.849
Can't hear that shit anymore!
I can't hear that!

21:53.897 --> 21:54.898
Daddy!

24:50.699 --> 24:53.410
We've reached the end of our silence.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.662
Remember, most words are meaningless.

24:55.746 --> 24:59.791
It is in the silence between the words
that we find true meaning.

25:01.084 --> 25:04.171
As we emerge
from a period of noble silence,

25:04.254 --> 25:06.840
we enter into a period of noble speech.

25:06.924 --> 25:09.384
As you return to words, do so carefully.

25:09.468 --> 25:12.888
If you don't feel the impulse to speak,
please do not.

25:13.305 --> 25:17.100
But if you would like to share
any aspect of your experience,

25:17.184 --> 25:18.936
please feel free to do so now.

25:23.690 --> 25:24.858
Yes.

25:24.942 --> 25:27.694
Hi. I'm Henry.

25:28.362 --> 25:32.824
The hardest part for me was letting go
of time, wanting to watch the clock.

25:32.908 --> 25:34.701
Were you able to move past it?

25:34.785 --> 25:35.786
I think that I was.

25:37.204 --> 25:39.957
Oh, and I don't know if this counts
as noble speech,

25:40.040 --> 25:44.837
but you've had a price tag
hanging on your tunic the whole retreat.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.505
It's been driving me a little crazy.

25:48.340 --> 25:49.341
Thank you.

25:55.556 --> 25:56.557
Yes.

25:56.974 --> 25:58.350
I'm Lydia.

25:59.434 --> 26:04.189
I'm recently divorced.
And I just had so much anger.

26:04.815 --> 26:10.153
But I feel like I've somehow let
some of it go, because I feel lighter.

26:10.237 --> 26:11.613
That's wonderful, Lydia.

26:12.447 --> 26:14.199
My wife left me too.

26:14.283 --> 26:15.701
Oh, I'm sure she did.

26:16.118 --> 26:17.119
What?

26:17.452 --> 26:19.746
Come here. You--

26:21.331 --> 26:22.958
Oh, good work.

26:23.041 --> 26:25.419
-Thanks.
-Really.

26:25.502 --> 26:27.045
I had such an experience, you know.

26:27.129 --> 26:29.590
I mentioned
I didn't feel totally enlightened.

26:29.673 --> 26:32.759
And what is the crossover
of Buddhism and Judaism?

26:33.218 --> 26:34.219
Buddiasm.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.388
-Sure.
-I think.

26:45.397 --> 26:46.940
Hi, I'm Jack.

26:48.942 --> 26:50.360
You know that already.

26:51.737 --> 26:53.655
God, my voice sounds weird.

27:02.331 --> 27:07.211
I make my own soap.
I don't even know your name.

27:10.422 --> 27:12.758
I'm so sorry that I hit you in the face.

27:12.841 --> 27:15.177
I wanted to say something,
but we were not allowed to speak.

27:15.385 --> 27:18.013
I don't know what got into me.
I was so desperate.

27:18.096 --> 27:20.557
My biggest fear is to be... alone.

27:20.641 --> 27:22.309
Solitude terrifies me.

27:22.392 --> 27:26.271
So I decided to make
this big trip to America.

27:26.355 --> 27:27.481
All alone.

27:27.564 --> 27:29.441
As if it would solve everything,
but it didn't.

27:29.525 --> 27:31.401
Do you know how it feels
to be at the edge of the Grand Canyon,

27:31.485 --> 27:32.986
with no one to share it with?

27:33.070 --> 27:34.071
It's horrible!

27:34.154 --> 27:35.572
It's so sad.

27:36.114 --> 27:38.116
For me America was supposed to be...

27:38.200 --> 27:39.868
A promise of a big journey.
Like Thor Heyerdahl.

27:39.952 --> 27:41.411
But it was all rest stops and McDonald's.

27:41.495 --> 27:43.789
There are a lot of McDonald's here.

27:45.165 --> 27:47.417
You have no idea what I'm saying...

27:47.501 --> 27:48.502
...obviously.

27:48.585 --> 27:50.587
But I like the way you look at me.

27:50.671 --> 27:54.633
You have kind eyes.

27:55.259 --> 27:57.052
Nothing can start between us, though.

27:57.135 --> 27:58.136
Because...

27:58.220 --> 28:00.222
I have to finish working on myself.

28:00.305 --> 28:03.308
To find it in me.

28:03.892 --> 28:05.894
And not through someone else's eyes.

28:06.186 --> 28:08.355
There. I'm sorry.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.568
All I got was "McDonald's."

28:15.487 --> 28:16.697
Okay, I know this is weird,

28:16.780 --> 28:22.953
but I... am building...

28:24.538 --> 28:28.041
a cabin upstate.

28:31.003 --> 28:33.088
Would you like to come visit me?

28:37.092 --> 28:40.345
You... come...

28:42.931 --> 28:44.224
with me.

28:48.353 --> 28:52.107
Yes. Yes. I will come.
