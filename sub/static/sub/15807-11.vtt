01:14.908 --> 01:18.009
hello, hello.
Testing, 1,2,3,4.
Can you hear me?

01:18.078 --> 01:20.979
Yes, gilligan.
I can hear you fine.
Can you hear me?

01:21.048 --> 01:22.213
Yeah, I can hear you.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.015
Uh, yeah, I can hear you.
Can you hear me?

01:24.084 --> 01:26.985
Yes, gilligan,
i can hear you fine.
Can you hear me?

01:27.054 --> 01:28.586
Yeah, I can hear you.

01:28.655 --> 01:30.989
That professor sure
is smart to invent
this telephone system.

01:31.057 --> 01:32.324
That's right,
gilligan,

01:32.392 --> 01:33.725
and he's going to string
wires all over.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.294
That way we can talk
any place on the island.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.961
Gilligan! Skipper!
Have you seen ginger?

01:37.030 --> 01:38.230
She's been gone
all morning.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.298
Well, no I haven't.
She wasn't at breakfast.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.399
Oh, I'm awfully worried
about her.

01:41.468 --> 01:42.700
She's been acting
so funny lately.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.870
You mean funny funny
or funny strange?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.171
Funny strange.

01:46.239 --> 01:47.472
Well,
if she's missing,

01:47.541 --> 01:48.807
we ought to organize
a searching party.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.408
Oh, that's
a good idea.

01:50.477 --> 01:51.342
Well, come on, gilligan. She's
probably at the other end

01:51.411 --> 01:52.711
of the island.
Hey, wait.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.246
If she's on the other end
of the island

01:54.315 --> 01:55.113
why don't
we just call her?

01:55.182 --> 01:57.015
Hello! Hello!
Hello!

01:57.083 --> 01:59.618
The professor
hasn't strung
those wires yet.

01:59.687 --> 02:00.852
Oh, yeah.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.287
Cancel that last call.

02:04.792 --> 02:05.757
Come on, gilligan.

02:12.099 --> 02:14.566
Skipper: Ginger!

02:14.635 --> 02:15.967
Ginger!

02:16.036 --> 02:17.068
Gilligan: Ginger!

02:17.137 --> 02:18.636
Ginger!

02:18.705 --> 02:20.038
Ginger!

02:20.107 --> 02:21.406
Oh, we'll never find her
this way.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.241
We've got to split up.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.576
Split up? Oh, skipper,
we've been together
too long.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.644
You're like a father
to me.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.446
Gilligan--
i remember once--

02:27.514 --> 02:29.448
gilligan, what I mean is
we'll have to separate.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.083
That way we can cover
more territory.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.450
Oh.

02:32.519 --> 02:34.019
Now, I'll go over here,
and you go out over there.

02:34.088 --> 02:35.153
Right, skipper.

02:35.221 --> 02:38.690
Oh, gilligan!
I said out there!

02:46.099 --> 02:47.499
Ginger!

02:49.569 --> 02:51.603
Ginger!

02:51.672 --> 02:54.072
Hey, ginger!

02:54.141 --> 02:56.008
Skipper: Ginger!

02:56.076 --> 02:57.408
She's not over here.

02:57.477 --> 02:59.277
She's not over here.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.647
She's not
over here. Awk!

03:03.016 --> 03:04.783
[Squawks]

03:07.654 --> 03:09.287
Ginger!

03:09.355 --> 03:10.154
[Ginger sobbing]

03:10.223 --> 03:11.656
Oh, there you are!

03:11.725 --> 03:14.459
We've been looking
all over for you.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.027
That must be
a pretty sad story

03:16.096 --> 03:17.729
to make you cry
like that.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.364
Oh, gilligan.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.266
This was supposed to be
my opening night.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.468
I was going
to make my debut.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.370
I was supposed to star
in this play.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.705
I was in a play once
in school.

03:26.774 --> 03:29.040
It was called
<i> our friends in the forest.</i>

03:29.109 --> 03:30.174
I played
a squirrel,
oh, please!

03:30.243 --> 03:31.743
And all I had to do
was gather nuts

03:31.812 --> 03:33.412
while the rest of the animals
sat around and did nothing.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.080
I gathered nuts and nuts,
and by the time winter came

03:36.149 --> 03:38.450
I had plenty
to eat, but--

03:38.519 --> 03:41.085
I know. All the other
animals went hungry.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.355
You saw the play.

03:43.423 --> 03:46.024
Oh, gilligan.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.559
You just
don't understand.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.894
You just
don't understand.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.531
This play
was especially
written for me.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.299
Why, I would
have been famous
overnight

03:54.368 --> 03:55.767
if I got to do it.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.736
All Broadway
would have been
at my feet.

03:57.804 --> 03:58.903
Gee.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.772
Why, a new star
would have been born.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.841
My name would
have been assured
among the greats.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.210
Producers would be
clamoring for me.

04:05.278 --> 04:06.578
You know what,
ginger?

04:06.647 --> 04:07.445
What?

04:07.514 --> 04:09.447
You oughta be
on the stage.

04:09.516 --> 04:12.384
Oh, gilligan!
You don't understand
at all!

04:12.453 --> 04:14.486
You just
don't understand.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.089
I don't think
it's going to do
much good

04:18.158 --> 04:19.423
to take this
to ginger, skipper.

04:19.492 --> 04:20.692
Well, you tell her
she's got to eat that.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.694
She's got have
her strength kept up.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.230
Oh, I'll try.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.899
Poor girl.
Wish there was something
i could do for her.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.400
Why don't
you help her
carry the tray?

04:29.469 --> 04:30.702
Oh, not her, gilligan.
For ginger.
Oh.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.270
She's still
pretty broken up.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.939
I don't blame her.
I was just reading
the play.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.440
It's pretty good.
Lots of action in it.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.142
Listen to this...

04:37.210 --> 04:39.277
Quiet!
Not another word!

04:39.346 --> 04:40.545
I will take
this sword

04:40.614 --> 04:42.013
and split
your skull.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.281
I will throw off
these chains.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.949
I refuse to be
your slave.

04:45.018 --> 04:45.917
I will
no longer toil

04:45.986 --> 04:46.918
for a thankless
tyrant,

04:46.986 --> 04:48.653
who will never
allow--

04:48.722 --> 04:49.654
here, here, here!
What's going on here?
A mutiny?

04:49.723 --> 04:51.022
Don't worry,
Mr. howell--

04:51.091 --> 04:52.657
don't you talk to me,
you scurvy mutineer!

04:52.726 --> 04:54.459
Captain,
throw this man in irons!

04:54.528 --> 04:56.294
Oh, relax, Mr. howell.
This is not a mutiny.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.962
He's just reading
some lines from a play.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.130
Uh, a play?

04:59.199 --> 05:00.465
Yes.
Reading
some lines--

05:00.533 --> 05:02.300
well, if there's one thing
i can't stand

05:02.369 --> 05:03.768
is a mutiny before lunch.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.170
See, Mr. howell.
It's a script.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.472
Oh, a script.
Oh, yes.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.173
Title,<i> </i>
<i> a pyramid for two</i>

05:09.242 --> 05:10.041
big set, small cast.

05:10.109 --> 05:11.476
It's ginger's play.

05:11.544 --> 05:13.145
She was supposed to have been
on Broadway last night.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.345
Oh, well,
I'd like to read it.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.680
I backed a few shows
in my time.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.749
Musicals, you know.
Dancing girls.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.484
It's the only business
where you can be a devil

05:19.553 --> 05:21.853
when you're
an angel.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.789
You get it?
No.

05:23.857 --> 05:27.292
Well, a backer is called
an angel--never mind.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.027
Mr. howell,
maybe you could back
this play.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.228
Me?

05:30.297 --> 05:31.863
Sure, Mr. howell.
We can try it out here

05:31.932 --> 05:33.064
and if it's good,
we can take it to Broadway.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.532
Well,
i don't know...

05:34.601 --> 05:35.700
Why don't you do it,
Mr. howell?

05:35.768 --> 05:36.968
It would be
a lot of prestige.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.369
I've got prestige.

05:38.438 --> 05:39.804
And if it's a hit,
you make a million dollars.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.540
I've got
a million dollars.

05:41.608 --> 05:43.641
If it's a flop,
you can deduct it
from your income tax.

05:43.710 --> 05:46.477
Now you're talking!

05:46.546 --> 05:49.413
Oh, ginger, you've got
to eat something.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.449
Oh, come on, honey.
Snap out of it.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.785
Thanks, Mary Ann.
I'll be alright.

05:53.854 --> 05:54.986
Oh, here.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.721
You've always admired this.
Wear it a little while.

05:56.789 --> 05:57.889
Maybe it'll make you
feel better.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.590
Gilligan:
Ginger! Hey, ginger!

05:59.659 --> 06:02.227
Gilligan!
She's in here.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.895
Hey, ginger.
Ginger, guess what?

06:03.963 --> 06:05.429
Mr. howell's going
to put the play on.

06:05.498 --> 06:06.731
Oh, that's
wonderful!
What?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.300
What's wonderful about it?

06:08.369 --> 06:10.001
So what, if he puts
my play on here.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.169
You don't understand.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.737
We'll put it on here first,
and if it's real good,

06:12.806 --> 06:14.439
Mr. howell will take it
to Broadway.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.741
Meanwhile, the island's...
The island's kind of like
off-Broadway.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.643
Oh!
Oh, that's great!

06:18.712 --> 06:20.612
Oh, Mr. howell
has all kinds
of influence.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.180
If anyone
can make you a star,
he can.

06:22.248 --> 06:24.683
Oh, gilligan,
you've made me
so happy.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.984
You're wonderful!
You're just marvelous.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.821
I don't know how
to describe you,
you're so great.

06:29.890 --> 06:30.889
[Bonk]

06:34.694 --> 06:36.495
Let's see now.
Whom can I get

06:36.563 --> 06:37.461
to play
the leading man
in this play?

06:37.530 --> 06:39.297
Well, what's
he like, dear?

06:39.366 --> 06:43.502
Well, the part calls
for someone who has
a magnificent physique

06:43.570 --> 06:46.304
ravishingly handsome,
marvelous diction.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.639
I know who would be
perfect

06:47.707 --> 06:49.607
but I'll be too busy
directing the play.

06:49.676 --> 06:50.875
Alright.
Back to business.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.477
Now, let's finish
typing the parts.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.713
Well,
I'm ready, dear.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.482
Marc Antony brings you
news from Rome.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.950
The battle
goes well,

06:59.018 --> 07:02.187
and the armies
move onward,
ever onward.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.821
Have you got that,
my dear?

07:03.890 --> 07:06.057
M-a-r...

07:06.126 --> 07:08.760
C! Marc! There!

07:08.828 --> 07:11.762
Uh, what did you say
after that, dear?

07:11.831 --> 07:14.532
I see this is
going to be
a long rewrite.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.468
Well, I've
never typed before

07:16.536 --> 07:18.170
and this typewriter's
very confusing.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.604
They have the abcs
all mixed up.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.272
Mr. howell!
Mr. howell!

07:21.341 --> 07:23.975
Oh, gilligan told me
you're going to produce
my play.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.111
Oh, you've made me
the happiest girl
in the world.

07:27.914 --> 07:30.649
Come, my dear.
Let's not lose our heads.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.651
I just wanted
to thank you,
Mr. howell

07:32.719 --> 07:33.851
I'll see you
at rehearsal, huh?

07:33.920 --> 07:37.288
Ta ta, my dear.
See you at the theater.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.457
Emotional little creature,
isn't she?

07:39.526 --> 07:41.292
Yes.

07:41.361 --> 07:45.763
And if I were you,
I'd wipe her gratitude
off my face.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.499
Oh! Yes, yes.
Of course.

07:48.568 --> 07:51.235
Now, where were we,
my dear?

07:51.304 --> 07:52.937
Marc.

07:53.006 --> 07:56.541
A ship! Look, in the harbor.
I see a ship.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.508
A ship, a ship!
We're saved!

07:57.577 --> 07:59.010
Where is it?
Where is it?

07:59.079 --> 08:00.712
Please, gilligan.
I'm practicing
my lines.

08:00.780 --> 08:01.946
Your acting
sure is convincing.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.881
I thought there was
a ship in the harbor.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.916
Oh, gilligan.
I gotta change
my costume.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.586
Oh.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.190
Gee, professor.
You're doing
a real neat job.

08:13.259 --> 08:14.926
Thanks, gilligan.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.027
You know, these jungle berries
mixed with water
make excellent paint.

08:17.096 --> 08:18.396
Mmm. And in case
the play's a flop,

08:18.464 --> 08:19.864
we always can eat
the scenery.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.733
I thought
you were supposed to be
fixing that door.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.802
I already
finished it.
Look here.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.604
See? It works
just fine. See?

08:25.672 --> 08:26.671
Oh, no, gilligan,
that's wrong.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.406
The door should open in,
not out.

08:28.475 --> 08:31.309
Why? It works fine.
What's wrong with it
having open out?

08:31.377 --> 08:33.211
[Skipper moans]

08:38.083 --> 08:39.884
Sorry, skipper. I didn't know
you were there--

08:39.952 --> 08:43.721
gilligan, how do you manage
to always do something--

08:43.789 --> 08:45.089
never mind, gilligan!

08:45.158 --> 08:46.524
Skipper,
skipper...

08:46.593 --> 08:48.359
Are you mad?

08:48.428 --> 08:50.595
Believe it
or not, yes!

08:50.664 --> 08:52.830
Skipper, oh,
I'm glad you're here.

08:52.899 --> 08:55.333
I want you to try on this toga
that I made for you.

08:55.402 --> 08:56.534
See if it's
big enough.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.670
Put your head
through there.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.438
Where do I put
the rest of it, Mary Ann?

09:00.507 --> 09:02.173
There! Oh, wait.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.512
Alright, cast.
Rehearsal time.
Places, everyone.

09:07.581 --> 09:10.849
Marc Antony, Caesar,
Julius, Marc...

09:10.918 --> 09:11.749
Professor: Here we are,
Mr. howell.

09:11.818 --> 09:12.850
Oh, oh, fine.

09:12.919 --> 09:13.784
How do I look,
Mr. howell?

09:13.853 --> 09:15.153
Well, I know
in the play

09:15.222 --> 09:16.788
that Cleopatra's
supposed to be
crazy about you,

09:16.857 --> 09:19.857
but you're
not exactly
my type.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.193
By the way, where is
the queen of the nile?

09:22.261 --> 09:24.129
Here I am.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.463
How do I look?

09:25.532 --> 09:27.532
Oh, you look
ravishing.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.533
I must say,
you look ravishing.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.102
I envy that snake, my dear.
Thank you.

09:31.170 --> 09:32.937
Well, shall we
get on with it?

09:33.006 --> 09:36.274
Alright, everyone.
Clear the stage,
clear the stage.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.977
Now, in this one, you haven't
seen your lover for ages,
you understand?

09:39.045 --> 09:40.712
You're yearning for him.
You're pining for him.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.014
You're over there
by the window
when you see the ship.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.617
Alright, alright.
Places. Let's go.

09:46.787 --> 09:50.154
Look! I see a ship...
In the harbor.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.556
I see a ship!

09:51.625 --> 09:52.890
A ship! A ship!
Where? We're saved!

09:52.959 --> 09:54.024
Where is it?
Where is it?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.826
Gilligan, what
are you doing?

09:55.895 --> 09:57.529
Oh, it's just
the play.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.897
Yes, yes.
Would you mind
clearing the stage--

09:59.966 --> 10:02.166
get off there!
Where were we... oh, yes, yes.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.601
You're over there
by the window

10:03.670 --> 10:05.203
and the maid
brings in the nectar.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.371
Is the maid there?

10:06.439 --> 10:07.572
Lovey:
Yes, I'm ready.

10:07.641 --> 10:08.540
Alright, alright.
Places.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.840
Take it from the top.

10:09.909 --> 10:13.678
A ship! Look!
In the harbor,
i see a ship.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.684
What is this?!
Hurry, dear!

10:24.390 --> 10:26.290
I bring you--

10:26.359 --> 10:28.326
oh, go get it!

10:28.395 --> 10:30.061
Don't yell at me.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.601
I bring you--

10:36.669 --> 10:39.637
I bring you nectar,
my queen.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.539
Lovey, my dear,
you mustn't cross

10:41.607 --> 10:43.007
in front of
a big star.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.475
Oh?

10:44.544 --> 10:46.144
Try it again.

10:46.212 --> 10:49.380
I bring you nectar,
my queen.

10:49.449 --> 10:50.948
Thank you!
No, ginger.

10:51.017 --> 10:52.016
Ginger, you mustn't
say thank you.

10:52.084 --> 10:53.751
See, th-that's
a servant.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.921
That's a non-entity,
a very lowly person,
you understand?

10:56.990 --> 10:59.724
And incidentally,
you look every inch
a queen.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.192
Proud and beautiful,

11:01.261 --> 11:03.695
accustomed
to the adoration
of the world.

11:03.763 --> 11:04.529
Thurston?

11:04.598 --> 11:05.964
You're beautiful.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.031
Thurston!

11:07.100 --> 11:09.067
Oh, yes! Yes, yes,
what is it, dear?

11:09.135 --> 11:11.035
I'd like a word
with you alone.

11:11.103 --> 11:13.338
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.

11:13.407 --> 11:15.273
Maintain that mood.
Yes.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.080
Yes, my dear,
what is it?

11:23.149 --> 11:25.550
Thurston, do you
remember the day
we got married?

11:25.618 --> 11:27.084
Indeed, I do.

11:27.153 --> 11:30.487
That was the day
consolidated general
jumped 17 points.

11:30.556 --> 11:32.156
Do you
still love me?

11:32.224 --> 11:34.758
Of course, I do, darling.
I adore you.

11:34.827 --> 11:37.762
You're...You're
Mrs. thurston howell III.

11:37.831 --> 11:38.896
Well, doesn't it
bother you

11:38.965 --> 11:40.865
that Mrs. thurston
howell III

11:40.934 --> 11:43.033
should have such
a teensy weensy part

11:43.102 --> 11:44.969
in her husband's
play?

11:45.037 --> 11:46.537
I never thought of it
that way.

11:46.606 --> 11:49.373
A howell
playing a maid.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.742
Well, it isn't exactly
typecasting, is it?

11:51.811 --> 11:53.677
But the only parts left are,
let's see...

11:53.746 --> 11:56.213
The, uh, high priestess?

11:56.282 --> 11:58.182
Slave girl?

11:58.251 --> 12:00.084
Lady in waiting?

12:00.152 --> 12:03.021
Well, the only part left
is Cleopatra.

12:08.127 --> 12:10.361
Alright.
On stage, everyone.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.665
Everyone on stage.
That's it. On the double.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.399
Now, I have
a announcement to make.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.135
I've decided on
a slight cast change.

12:18.204 --> 12:21.038
Mrs. howell will play
the part of Cleopatra,

12:21.107 --> 12:23.407
and ginger will play
the part of the maid.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.309
[Sobs]

12:25.378 --> 12:26.711
But, Mr. howell,
ginger had
her heart set

12:26.780 --> 12:27.812
on playing
that part.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.781
That's showbiz.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.625
A ship! Look in the harbor.

12:40.693 --> 12:41.960
I see a ship.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.327
A ship? A ship?

12:43.396 --> 12:45.930
Oh, we're saved!
Where--
gilligan!

12:45.999 --> 12:48.165
Oh. Still the play, huh?

12:48.234 --> 12:49.567
Gilligan, what's
wrong with you?

12:49.636 --> 12:50.468
Will you
get backstage?

12:50.536 --> 12:51.569
Excuse me, Mr. howell.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.270
I'll just go
fix the scene.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.072
Really. Alright,
lovey, my dear.

12:55.141 --> 12:56.273
Take it
from the top.

12:56.342 --> 12:59.343
A ship.
Look in the harbor.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.446
I see a ship!

13:02.616 --> 13:04.048
That's the cue
for the maid

13:04.117 --> 13:06.350
to enter
with the nectar.
Where is the maid?

13:06.419 --> 13:07.985
Ginger, ginger,
where's ginger?

13:08.054 --> 13:09.286
I'm sorry, Mr. howell,
but I'm afraid

13:09.355 --> 13:10.955
Cleopatra'll have
to go on the wagon.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.124
Ginger refuses to play
the part of the maid.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.460
Oh, dear. It's so hard
to keep help these days.

13:16.529 --> 13:17.595
Pretty hard,
Mr. howell.

13:17.664 --> 13:18.596
She went
back to her hut.

13:18.665 --> 13:19.697
I think
she was crying.

13:19.765 --> 13:21.366
Oh, temperament!

13:21.434 --> 13:23.168
I tell you,
all you actresses

13:23.236 --> 13:25.303
are little children
in a tantrum world!

13:25.372 --> 13:26.971
Ah, you're all
against me!

13:27.040 --> 13:29.307
I can't put on a show
with this temperament!

13:29.375 --> 13:30.340
Do you hear me?

13:30.409 --> 13:31.876
If there's one thing
i can't stand

13:31.944 --> 13:34.412
it's temperament!
Temperament!

13:35.815 --> 13:36.914
[Crying]

13:36.982 --> 13:38.916
Don't cry, ginger.
I know how you feel

13:38.985 --> 13:40.184
but it's not
the end of the world.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.286
I was gonna
be discovered.

13:42.354 --> 13:44.622
I was gonna
open on Broadway.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.291
I was gonna
be a star!

13:46.359 --> 13:47.858
Now look at me!

13:47.927 --> 13:49.694
You're right.
It's the end of the world.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.295
Oh, gilligan,
stop that.

13:51.363 --> 13:53.063
That's no way
to cheer her up.

13:53.132 --> 13:54.566
Oh, yeah, I was
supposed to cheer her up.

13:54.634 --> 13:55.867
Look on the bright side,
ginger.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.602
Maybe we'll
never be rescued

13:57.671 --> 14:00.104
and maybe we'll be
marooned on this island
for the rest of our lives.

14:00.172 --> 14:03.407
Then there'll be
no Broadway, no play,
no nothing. Ha ha.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.843
I may do
something desperate.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.445
Oh, gilligan, out!
Huh?

14:07.513 --> 14:08.680
Out! Out!

14:08.748 --> 14:09.847
You trying
to tell me something?

14:09.915 --> 14:12.283
I certainly am.
Out, gilligan!

14:13.820 --> 14:17.355
Oh, my fair queen,
come away with me
and share my--

14:17.423 --> 14:18.890
skipper?
Just a minute,
gilligan.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.091
But, skipper, I want
to talk to you.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.458
It's about ginger.
Remember we--

14:21.527 --> 14:22.493
gilligan, please.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.595
Can't you see that
I'm rehearsing my lines?

14:24.664 --> 14:26.563
Oh.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.265
Oh, my fair queen

14:28.334 --> 14:32.303
come away with me
and share my lot.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.938
Our love will--

14:34.007 --> 14:35.272
our love--

14:35.341 --> 14:38.676
our love will last
all through et--

14:38.745 --> 14:40.311
eternity.

14:40.380 --> 14:40.878
Eternity?

14:40.947 --> 14:42.580
Eternity!

14:42.649 --> 14:43.947
Think we can talk
now, skipper, huh?
Now can we talk?

14:44.016 --> 14:45.116
Well, you're a fine pal.

14:45.184 --> 14:46.317
I mean, what'd you
think of my acting?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.052
Your acting?
That last speech I made.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.319
What did you think of it?

14:49.388 --> 14:51.121
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.090
Well, listen this time.
I'll do it over again.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.357
I want your opinion.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.825
But, skipper, I want
to talk to you.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.962
Gilligan, will you
stop and listen?

14:58.030 --> 14:59.631
Oh, my fair queen--

14:59.699 --> 15:01.732
that was just great,
skipper. Just great!

15:01.801 --> 15:03.166
Gilligan,
i haven't even said it.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.336
Yeah, but now
can we talk?

15:05.404 --> 15:07.938
Will you go away
and let me alone

15:08.007 --> 15:10.975
and do my rehearsing
by myself?

15:11.044 --> 15:12.210
[Sighs]

15:15.748 --> 15:17.548
Oh, my fair gilligan--

15:18.785 --> 15:20.218
oh, my--

15:22.422 --> 15:23.488
oh, my fair--

15:25.191 --> 15:27.958
my heart,
it beats so.

15:28.027 --> 15:30.628
I can scarce hear
my lover's approach.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.463
That is very good.
Very good, lovey.

15:32.531 --> 15:35.466
Now remember,
Cleopatra is
a woman of passion

15:35.534 --> 15:37.802
and she is waiting
for her lover
Marc Antony

15:37.870 --> 15:39.803
to return from Rome.
Got that?

15:39.872 --> 15:40.938
I think so.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.273
Your eyes
are glowing.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.874
Your temples
are pounding.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.509
Your heart
is beating fast.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.446
Your anxiety
is such that you
can hardly breathe.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.315
Just pretend
that you've eaten
a Hungarian dinner.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.850
Oh, yes!

15:52.918 --> 15:54.385
Very good.
I knew you'd get it.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.754
Are--are you ready,
Marc Antony?

15:56.822 --> 15:58.088
I'm ready, Mr. howell.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.089
Just give me my cue.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.925
Good, good, good.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.560
Curtain. Lights.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.995
You're on, my dear.

16:05.064 --> 16:08.399
My heart beats so.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.469
I can scarce hear
my lover's approach.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.203
Skipper,
can I talk to you?

16:13.272 --> 16:15.306
Not now, gilligan.
I'm waiting for my cue.

16:15.374 --> 16:17.207
My heart, it beats so.

16:17.276 --> 16:20.444
I can scarce hear
my lover's approach.

16:20.513 --> 16:21.746
That's my cue.
Please, skipper.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.385
Well, Marc Antony,
say something.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.520
I forgot my line,
Mr. howell.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.323
"O gracious queen,

16:32.392 --> 16:35.192
greet thy happy sailor."
Trippingly.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.961
I--i--
i got it now.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.363
I got it.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.464
Now, skipper? Now?

16:40.533 --> 16:41.565
Not now, gilligan.

16:41.634 --> 16:42.600
But you promised.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.202
My heart, it beats so.

16:45.271 --> 16:49.140
I can scarce hear
my lover's approach.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.176
O gracious greet,

16:52.245 --> 16:53.778
queen thy happy sailor.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.680
In the name
of Richard Burton

16:56.749 --> 16:58.349
what are you doing?

16:58.417 --> 17:00.718
I'm sorry, Mr. howell,
but it's gilligan.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.053
He's pestering me.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.554
Never mind that.
We'll take care of that.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.757
Do it again,
will you please?

17:05.825 --> 17:07.425
Alright, sir.

17:09.061 --> 17:10.194
Now, skipper?
Now, huh?

17:10.262 --> 17:11.829
Not now, gilligan!
For goodness sakes

17:11.897 --> 17:13.164
help with the scenery
or the props

17:13.233 --> 17:14.298
or do something!

17:14.366 --> 17:16.633
My heart, it beats so.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.569
I can scarce hear
my lover's approach.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.342
O gracious sailor,
queen thy happy greet!

17:27.913 --> 17:30.214
Skipper:
Please, Mr. howell,
just once more?

17:30.282 --> 17:31.783
Just once more.
Alright.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.253
Really, darling.
How can I perform

17:36.322 --> 17:39.022
when the other actors
can't remember their lines?

17:39.091 --> 17:40.991
Never mind, lovey.
Calm down.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.459
He's a slow study.

17:42.528 --> 17:45.129
Mrs. howell:
I can scarce hear my--

17:45.197 --> 17:46.497
Mr. howell: Gilligan!

17:46.566 --> 17:48.365
What are you doing
with that ladder?

17:48.434 --> 17:49.700
The professor has
to paint the scenery.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.969
Well, not now.
We're rehearsing!

17:52.038 --> 17:54.438
Okay. I'll take it
backstage.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.475
I can scarce hear
my lover's approach.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.678
Aaah!

18:06.919 --> 18:09.954
Oh, that last rehearsal,
my dear, was simply marvelous.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.923
With my directing
and my producing

18:11.991 --> 18:14.124
this play could be
a big Broadway hit.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.994
Thurston,
you haven't said a word
about my performance.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.161
No, I haven't, have I?

18:18.230 --> 18:20.397
Well, it's an oversight
on my part.

18:20.466 --> 18:23.000
Eh, may I say, my dear,
that you are simply splendid.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.702
Oh, thank you,
thurston.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.770
Even ginger, whom
i replaced in the part

18:26.839 --> 18:28.238
paid me a compliment.

18:28.307 --> 18:31.909
She compared me to a famous
television personality.

18:31.978 --> 18:32.909
Oh, good.

18:32.978 --> 18:35.112
By the way,
who is Mr. ed?

18:35.181 --> 18:37.215
I haven't any idea.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.417
I wonder why she didn't
compare you to Mrs. ed.

18:39.485 --> 18:40.817
I can hardly wait
for tomorrow night.

18:40.886 --> 18:44.021
Opening night. Lot of details
to attend to, my dear.

18:44.089 --> 18:45.922
See you later.
Mm.

18:45.991 --> 18:47.224
Hello, gilligan, my boy.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.892
Hi, Mr. howell.
Can I talk
to Mrs. howell?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.628
There she is--
Cleopatra.

18:50.696 --> 18:51.662
See you later.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.200
Hi, Mrs. howell.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.469
I hope you're not
gonna get mad at me
for what I'm gonna say.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.037
It's got nothing to do
with your acting.

19:00.105 --> 19:01.239
I think that's real good.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.973
Maybe even better
than Mr. Ed's.

19:03.042 --> 19:06.076
But you see, the reason
we put this play on
in the first place

19:06.145 --> 19:09.413
was because ginger was
feeling so terrible
about Broadway

19:09.482 --> 19:11.615
and you're a very
important woman,
Mrs. howell.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.417
You got
everything you want

19:13.486 --> 19:16.420
but this play is
the only thing ginger's got.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.189
And, uh, I hope you're
not getting mad at me.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.392
See, ginger's
getting real desperate

19:21.461 --> 19:25.062
and I thought that
maybe if you'd, uh...

19:25.130 --> 19:26.597
I guess you're
getting mad at me.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.799
You haven't
said a single word.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.636
What?

19:32.705 --> 19:35.138
What's the matter,
Mrs. howell?

19:35.207 --> 19:37.208
Mr. howell? Mr. howell?

19:37.276 --> 19:38.409
What is it, gilligan?

19:38.478 --> 19:40.410
She's talking,
but nothing's coming out.

19:40.479 --> 19:42.780
Lovey, my dear,
what is it?

19:44.183 --> 19:46.383
By George,
she's got laryngitis.

19:46.452 --> 19:47.918
Yeah, and she
lost her voice, too.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.686
A star with laryngitis.

19:49.755 --> 19:51.322
Oh, it's the scourge
of every producer.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.523
What are you gonna do,
Mr. howell?

19:52.592 --> 19:53.757
I'll have to call off
the show.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.459
I'm an angel
with my wings clipped.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.194
Why don't you use ginger?
She knows all the lines.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.128
Well, I don't know.
Mr. howell,

19:58.197 --> 19:59.297
I saw a movie once

19:59.365 --> 20:00.464
and just before
the star went on

20:00.532 --> 20:02.166
she fell down
and broke both her arms.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.501
Or was it
both her legs?

20:03.570 --> 20:05.136
Well, anyhow, there was
a girl in the chorus

20:05.205 --> 20:06.770
and she knew all the lines
and all the dances

20:06.839 --> 20:08.239
and the producer was
going out of his mind

20:08.307 --> 20:09.106
when all of a sudden
he yelled--

20:09.175 --> 20:10.174
get the understudy!

20:10.243 --> 20:11.409
You saw the picture,
too.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.611
On the late show.
Go, my boy!

20:13.680 --> 20:14.812
Lovey, try.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.418
Here we go, my dear.
Oh, no, sir.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.153
Here's your seat
right up here, sir.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.488
Nonsense!
I always sit

20:24.557 --> 20:26.156
second row center
with Mrs. howell!

20:26.225 --> 20:27.257
May I see your ticket,
please, sir?

20:27.326 --> 20:28.625
Yeah,
you'll see it--

20:28.694 --> 20:30.094
what are you
talking about?

20:30.163 --> 20:32.529
Get backstage,
will you? Alright.

20:32.598 --> 20:34.565
The first-nighters
are here.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.667
Curtain!

20:36.736 --> 20:40.037
[Horn fanfare
playing]

20:40.106 --> 20:41.505
Beautiful set!

20:48.647 --> 20:50.915
Ginger: A ship.
Look, in the harbor.

20:50.983 --> 20:51.982
I see a ship.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.383
Your nectar,
oh, my queen.

20:53.452 --> 20:55.152
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

20:55.220 --> 20:56.386
I'm too excited.

20:56.455 --> 20:57.821
My lover's ship
is in the harbor.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.823
Oh, I must send him
this message.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.425
Send in the royal
messenger.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.027
No, no, no.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.439
You sent for me,
o queen?

21:15.508 --> 21:16.674
Oh, yes.
Yes, I did.

21:16.742 --> 21:18.442
I want you
to send this message

21:18.510 --> 21:20.110
to my lover
Marc Antony.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.445
But wait. No.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.946
You will
be recognized.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.448
Send in my maid.
Huh?

21:24.516 --> 21:25.883
My maid.
Send my maid in.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.652
Yes, o queen.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.998
You sent for me,
o queen?

21:41.066 --> 21:42.266
Oh, yes. Yes.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.201
I've decided that you
must take this message

21:44.270 --> 21:45.736
to my lover Marc Antony.
Yes, o queen.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.872
But wait! A woman!
You will be suspect.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.308
Send in my aged
but trustworthy major-domo.

21:51.377 --> 21:52.643
Send him in immediately.

21:52.711 --> 21:54.344
Yeah, that figures.
Look, why don't i--

21:54.413 --> 21:55.446
why don't you
give me the message,

21:55.515 --> 21:56.247
and I can give it
to him.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.748
No, no, no, no, no.

21:57.817 --> 22:01.352
I must--i must entrust it
to him with my own hands.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.196
Your maid said
you wanted me, o queen?

22:12.264 --> 22:13.497
Yes, yes.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.633
Deliver this message,
but be careful.

22:15.701 --> 22:17.167
Caesar's spies
are everywhere.

22:17.236 --> 22:18.602
I will be careful,
o queen.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.137
You know what to do
if you're caught?

22:20.206 --> 22:21.305
I'll eat it.

22:21.373 --> 22:22.872
Good, good, good.
This message

22:22.941 --> 22:24.742
must not fall
into Caesar's hands.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.844
Hark!
I hear footsteps.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.746
It's Caesar!

22:31.384 --> 22:32.883
No, no,
i was mistaken.

22:32.952 --> 22:33.684
It's not Caesar.

22:33.753 --> 22:36.153
Give me back
the message.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.155
Give me back
the message.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.924
Too late, o queen.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.459
It's wonderful, dear,

22:42.527 --> 22:45.129
and the next act
is even more dramatic.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.966
My heart, it beats so.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.902
I can scarce hear
my lover's approach.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.937
[Footsteps]

22:54.006 --> 22:55.773
Slave, open the door.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.143
Slave, open the door.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.378
Hunh!

23:05.751 --> 23:07.484
O gracious queen,
oh!

23:07.553 --> 23:10.421
Greet thy happy sailor!

23:18.697 --> 23:20.865
Wasn't she magnificent,
dear?

23:20.933 --> 23:22.165
Bravo, bravo!

23:22.234 --> 23:23.333
Bravo! Bra--

23:23.402 --> 23:24.368
what did you say?

23:24.436 --> 23:25.702
I said bravo.

23:25.771 --> 23:28.605
You--you didn't have
laryngitis after all.

23:28.673 --> 23:31.141
You were just being noble.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.611
I was just
being a howell.

23:35.314 --> 23:37.648
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo!

23:37.717 --> 23:39.650
Simply marvelous!

23:40.786 --> 23:41.786
Ooh! Ow!

23:48.227 --> 23:49.326
Gilligan!

23:49.395 --> 23:50.394
Gilligan, little buddy!

23:50.463 --> 23:51.729
Uuuhh!

24:00.406 --> 24:01.939
Come on, skipper.
Here.

24:02.007 --> 24:03.307
I'm sorry, skipper.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.775
Gilligan, never mind!

24:04.843 --> 24:06.577
Never mind, gilligan!

24:06.645 --> 24:08.078
I was just hanging up
the wash to dry.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.714
I saw that you were.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.717
Gilligan, I wanted
to talk to you
about something.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.485
Well, Mr. howell
really liked the play,
didn't he?

24:15.554 --> 24:17.321
He sure did. He's gonna
put it on Broadway

24:17.390 --> 24:18.522
when we get off
the island.

24:18.591 --> 24:19.723
Exactly.
Now, gilligan

24:19.791 --> 24:21.325
I want you
to forget something.

24:21.394 --> 24:22.559
Understand?
I want you to forget

24:22.628 --> 24:24.094
that I'm your skipper.
It's forgotten.

24:24.162 --> 24:25.495
And I want you
to forget that
you work for me.

24:25.564 --> 24:26.997
It's forgotten.
And I want you to forget

24:27.066 --> 24:28.198
that I'm twice
as big as you are.

24:28.267 --> 24:29.899
It's forgotten.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.101
Gilligan,
what did you think

24:31.170 --> 24:33.070
of my Marc Antony,
little buddy?

24:33.139 --> 24:34.671
It's forgotten.

24:34.740 --> 24:35.772
Come on now,
gilligan.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.474
What did you
really think?

24:37.542 --> 24:39.276
Terrible, terrible,
terrible.

24:39.344 --> 24:40.577
Don't pay
any attention to him.

24:40.646 --> 24:41.979
He just says
what he's taught.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.647
Uh-huh. And who's
been teaching him?

24:44.716 --> 24:46.851
Gilligan, gilligan,
gilligan. Awk!

24:46.919 --> 24:48.819
Blabbermouth.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.635
¶ They're here
for a long, long time ¶

25:05.704 --> 25:06.837
¶ they'll have to make ¶

25:06.906 --> 25:08.305
