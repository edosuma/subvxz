WEBVTT

00:08.843 --> 00:11.094
Christopher Columbus.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.347
You white son of a bitch.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.599
You tried to destroy my people,

00:15.683 --> 00:17.685
and yet we memorialize you

00:17.768 --> 00:18.954
right in the middle of Broadway

00:18.978 --> 00:22.481
as if you're some sort of M&amp;M store.

00:23.649 --> 00:24.942
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.

00:25.024 --> 00:26.777
Oh, hi, Jackie Lynn.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.612
Oh, ask her if she knows Seinfeld.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.198
Not all New Yorkers know each other,
Virgil.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.492
Well, today's the day, Mom.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.994
I'm doing it.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.204
Everything I came back to New York to do.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.372
Patrick Duffy?

00:38.455 --> 00:39.623
That was the first time.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.667
Tonight's my big charity thing.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.168
<i>Of course!</i>

00:43.251 --> 00:44.503
And we'll be proud of you,

00:44.586 --> 00:46.505
no matter how it goes.

00:46.588 --> 00:49.174
Right, honey?

00:49.257 --> 00:50.801
So proud!

00:50.885 --> 00:53.512
We'll be proud of all the fun
you're gonna have,

00:53.595 --> 00:57.224
and whatever dress you pick out, or...

00:57.307 --> 00:58.987
I don't know how to talk about this stuff.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.853
I wear supermarket jeans.

01:00.936 --> 01:03.188
Guys, it's not about the dress.

01:03.271 --> 01:06.567
It's about fixing 400 years of injustice

01:06.650 --> 01:07.985
in the dress,

01:08.068 --> 01:10.029
which is a cap sleeve, trumpet hem gown

01:10.111 --> 01:11.822
<i>with a foil print pattern,</i>

01:11.906 --> 01:13.198
and it's gorgeous.

01:13.281 --> 01:17.411
The point is, tonight is big.

01:18.245 --> 01:22.624
And I'm gonna make you wish
you'd never climbed up there.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.871
Okay, everything's ready
for the gala tonight.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.457
The seating chart's done,
the table settings are approved,

02:03.540 --> 02:04.893
and Sting is booked, with a guarantee

02:04.917 --> 02:06.251
of no lute-playing.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.419
And everyone's gonna be there.

02:08.502 --> 02:11.757
Probably because I made the invitations
so freakin' classy.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.551
I spelled "honour" with a "u"
like they do in England.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.804
Well, they better be ready
to open their checkbooks.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.974
The $1,000-a-plate ticket
barely covers expenses.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.934
This cost $1,000?

02:22.017 --> 02:25.479
Oh, no. I see it. I see it.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.065
Fifteen years ago,

02:28.148 --> 02:29.788
you know where I would have been tonight?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.610
Sitting with all the other sad mistresses

02:31.693 --> 02:33.445
at the bar of the Pierre Hotel...

02:33.528 --> 02:36.531
- I stayed at a hotel once.
- Nobody likes you.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.366
Waiting for Julian
to fake a work emergency

02:38.450 --> 02:40.953
so he could come spend a few hours
with me.

02:41.036 --> 02:44.289
I've been waiting so long,
my Rachel's starting to Phoebe.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.126
Jokes like that are why
he'll never leave her.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.128
And as soon as I stopped
making those jokes,

02:49.210 --> 02:50.587
he did leave her.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.547
Men find funny women disgusting.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.967
So then, I was the wife at the gala.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.885
But then he cheated on me.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.804
I guess none of it's great.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.555
Kimmy, while I'm at the salon,

03:00.639 --> 03:02.492
I need you to go pick up my dress
from Bergdorf's.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.518
I will treat it like
it's my own fanciest dress,

03:04.601 --> 03:07.146
which I got free when I signed up
for a bank account.

03:07.228 --> 03:10.149
And this can be my job, right?

03:13.443 --> 03:16.071
Last night,
Goatzilla flubbed his line again.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.531
I mean, how can you forget...

03:17.614 --> 03:20.534
Roar!

03:20.617 --> 03:23.370
Oh, man, yesterday was crazy for me too.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.955
We got a shipment of rebar in,

03:25.039 --> 03:27.124
but it was the five-foot
instead of the ten-foot.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.542
So I called the supplier,

03:28.625 --> 03:30.377
and they offered to give us a discount,

03:30.460 --> 03:33.630
but I was like,
"We can't work with this rebar!"

03:33.714 --> 03:36.008
Wow, I can't believe
that story ended like that.

03:36.091 --> 03:39.178
No, then some guy overhears me,
and he's like,

03:39.260 --> 03:41.221
"You trying to get rid of ten-foot rebar?"

03:41.304 --> 03:43.057
And I'm like, "No, I need ten-foot rebar.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.784
I'm trying to get rid of five-foot rebar."

03:44.808 --> 03:46.688
And he goes,
"Oh, 'cause I need ten-foot rebar."

03:46.727 --> 03:48.367
And I'm all, "Welcome to the party, pal!"

03:48.395 --> 03:50.915
And then he's like, "Can't you put
two fives together and just make ten?"

03:50.939 --> 03:52.459
And I'm like, "No, you can't do that."

03:52.524 --> 03:54.564
When you try to put two five-foot rebars
together...

03:55.527 --> 03:57.007
I'm sorry I took you in the bathroom,

03:57.071 --> 03:59.156
Ms. Jacqueline's dress,
but I really had to go,

03:59.239 --> 04:01.616
and you're too pretty
to let out of my sight.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.161
You're so elegant with your shiny pocket

04:04.244 --> 04:06.538
and your cool zipper.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.915
What?

04:07.998 --> 04:10.709
Secret bonus dress!

04:12.878 --> 04:15.255
Hello, I just used your bathroom,

04:15.338 --> 04:17.048
but I am not a customer... yet.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.425
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

04:18.507 --> 04:20.135
No, sir.

04:20.219 --> 04:22.721
If I ignore that sign, where does it end?

04:22.804 --> 04:25.432
Imagine if I ignored that sign too.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.689
I will have a large cocoa
and some chicken nuggets.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.942
With ketchup. Leave the bottle.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.550
So, where'd you serve?

05:00.634 --> 05:01.885
Me?

05:01.969 --> 05:03.053
Oh, I'm not a waitress,

05:03.137 --> 05:04.387
but I get that all the time.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.140
I just like calling people "Hon"

05:06.223 --> 05:08.492
and drawing smiley faces
on pieces of paper I give to them.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.477
No, I meant in the military. Sorry.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.771
I'm usually pretty good
at spotting other vets.

05:12.854 --> 05:13.981
Soldiers.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.941
You've kind of got that look.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.317
Because of my muscles?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.194
I do a lot of chin-ups in my apartment

05:19.278 --> 05:21.362
because the floors aren't safe.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.615
No, your eyes.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.575
Not that I was staring at your eyes

05:25.659 --> 05:27.161
like a weirdo or anything.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.288
I'm close with my mom... What? Okay.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.331
Just...

05:31.414 --> 05:33.792
You look like you've seen some stuff.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.419
Actually, I have seen some stuff.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.046
I'm not trying to pry.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.482
I don't love talking about
my own stuff either,

05:39.506 --> 05:41.258
but whatever your deal is,

05:41.340 --> 05:42.968
you're a survivor.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.739
And not being home for Christmas?

05:46.763 --> 05:48.140
That was the worst.

05:48.223 --> 05:49.641
Tell me about it.

05:51.559 --> 05:55.480
I was... away for 15 Christmases.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.607
At some point,
I started forgetting the words

05:57.691 --> 05:59.276
to Christmas carols, like,

05:59.358 --> 06:01.111
<i>♪ Jinky bongs, Jinky bongs ♪</i>

06:01.195 --> 06:02.988
<i>♪ Jinky Halloween, hey! ♪</i>

06:03.071 --> 06:04.698
That's why I'm making up for lost time.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.365
You know the G.I. Bill?

06:06.449 --> 06:07.534
It's G.I. Joe.

06:07.617 --> 06:11.663
And I'm all about making up for lost time,
homeslice.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.915
Still working on the lingo-rooski.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.500
I know the feeling, G-money.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.394
Man, it's nice to talk to somebody
who gets it.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.671
Everyone else just wants to buy me a drink

06:19.754 --> 06:22.132
and say, "Thank you for your service."

06:22.216 --> 06:23.717
I like talking to you, too, Keith.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.444
And not just because
every time you get a drink,

06:25.468 --> 06:27.346
I get another little umbrella.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.348
For Mousey Poppins.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.558
I wish I didn't have to go back to work.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.185
"Work"? "I"?

06:33.268 --> 06:34.477
"Have to get back to"?

06:34.561 --> 06:36.395
I have to get back to work!

06:36.479 --> 06:37.856
Sorry. Nugs are on me.

06:39.482 --> 06:42.319
That's a cool, shorter way
to say "nuggets."

06:45.280 --> 06:47.615
Hello, I have an appointment
under "White."

06:47.699 --> 06:49.408
And I brought my own neck hooks.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.828
Jacqueline!

06:51.912 --> 06:54.956
Deirdre!

06:55.040 --> 06:57.042
You look amazing.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.626
Oh, you're nice.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.296
I feel disgusting. I had twins yesterday.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.756
- Eh!
- Ahhh...

07:02.839 --> 07:04.716
And I know it just started,
but I am already

07:04.799 --> 07:07.219
so exhausted from gala season.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.845
Tell me about it.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.222
Did you know that poor people

07:10.305 --> 07:12.099
don't even have to do gala season?

07:12.182 --> 07:14.017
What? They just skip it?

07:14.101 --> 07:17.104
Why do they look so tired
all the time then?

07:17.187 --> 07:19.189
So, you're coming tonight, though, right?

07:19.273 --> 07:21.316
Well, obviously. It's my gala.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.943
Why do you think I'm here,

07:23.026 --> 07:24.879
getting nothing rejuvenated...
Don't worry about it.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.781
No, your gala is December 10th.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.700
Tonight's my benefit
for Lupus Awareness Awareness.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.120
Not enough people know
about Lupus Awareness.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.247
December?

07:35.330 --> 07:36.331
No.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.208
This is clearly a mistake.

07:38.292 --> 07:41.169
We couldn't have scheduled our galas
on the same night.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.921
What if we did?

07:43.004 --> 07:45.757
That would be... interesting.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.926
- That would be a disaster!
- Exactly!

07:48.009 --> 07:49.510
For one of us. But who?

07:49.594 --> 07:52.555
I haven't felt this alive
since I left the State Department.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.016
You know, I faked the Saddam capture.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.185
He's still out there.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.687
Oh, you know what, Deirdre?
I just remembered.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.607
I need to rush out of here
making weird panicked noises.

08:10.907 --> 08:14.119
I met a really cute guy
at a restaurant where I peed!

08:14.202 --> 08:15.287
Gross. Tell me more.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.788
He was a handsome soldier,

08:16.871 --> 08:18.873
just like Lieutenant Dan,
or Colonel Sanders!

08:18.957 --> 08:20.375
And he thought I was a soldier too.

08:20.459 --> 08:21.779
'Cause I'm tough, like a soldier.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.379
Hyah! Hyah! Do soldiers do that?

08:24.463 --> 08:25.964
Based on my Fleet Week experiences?

08:26.047 --> 08:27.715
Sometimes.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.259
It's just, I've taken some knocks,

08:29.343 --> 08:30.903
and sometimes I felt like
I was moving backwards,

08:30.927 --> 08:32.971
or sideways, or any way but forward.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.722
So we are talking about Fleet Week.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.475
But maybe this is forward.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.726
A guy who really understands
what I went through.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.145
When are you seeing him again?

08:40.227 --> 08:41.770
I can makeover montage Tuesday

08:41.855 --> 08:43.606
or Thursday after "Wendy Williams."

08:43.690 --> 08:45.775
Oh, I don't know if I'm seeing him again.

08:45.859 --> 08:46.860
I didn't do that part.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.778
Kimbecile, what do I always say?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.840
"Don't touch my dolls,
they're strictly look-upons"?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.842
- Not that.
- "Only Aladdin can pull off harem pants"?

08:52.866 --> 08:53.783
Not that.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.661
- "John Cusack got fat, but I still would"?
- No, get the digits!

08:56.744 --> 08:58.372
The digits!

08:58.455 --> 08:59.706
Oh, look at us.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.334
Both having man problems.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.836
Is that why you've been shouting so much
in the bathroom?

09:04.919 --> 09:07.047
No, that's because of cheese.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.923
I'm talking about Mikey.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.258
He just talks and talks,

09:10.342 --> 09:12.010
and I have to listen and listen.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.720
It's exhausting.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.930
Well, that's just part of dating
in the '90s.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.849
Like compromising, or women be shopping.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.851
Ham-burger!

09:19.934 --> 09:21.353
Relationships are hard.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.688
I don't know how
Jackie Onassis did it twice.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.524
Look, in the bunker, I got pretty good

09:25.606 --> 09:27.567
at pretending to pay attention to people.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.361
<i>Whenever anyone was talking nonsense,</i>

09:29.444 --> 09:31.422
<i>I'd just pretend their eyes and mouth
were flipped.</i>

09:31.446 --> 09:33.865
He was a ghost the whole time.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.284
Oh, another movie idea I have
is about a village

09:36.368 --> 09:37.911
you think is in olden times,

09:37.994 --> 09:40.038
but no, it's in now times.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.249
Oh, also, I have another idea

09:42.332 --> 09:44.000
where the bad guys are plants,

09:44.084 --> 09:46.086
but Marky Mark is there!

09:46.169 --> 09:47.587
It's hard not to look interested

09:47.670 --> 09:50.257
when an upside-down face
is talking at you.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.675
Kimpanzee,
you may have lived through a nightmare,

09:52.759 --> 09:54.635
but you learned so much cool stuff.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.721
Like how to dress a pretend salad?

09:56.804 --> 09:59.474
"Salad"? Starter. Track and field.

09:59.558 --> 10:00.975
Field greens. Salad.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.060
Dress... Dress!

10:02.143 --> 10:04.812
I left the dress at the restaurant!

10:10.527 --> 10:12.404
Why does Deirdre Robespierre

10:12.487 --> 10:14.114
think my benefit is two months from now,

10:14.239 --> 10:15.615
instead of tonight?

10:15.698 --> 10:17.492
Oh, maybe she got hacked,
like on the news.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.119
Am I using that right?

10:19.202 --> 10:20.388
What have you done?

10:20.412 --> 10:22.122
What have who done? Me done?

10:22.205 --> 10:23.790
Why is the date ahead of the month?

10:23.873 --> 10:25.625
'Cause I was trying to do it fancy.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.028
That's how they do it in England,

10:27.085 --> 10:28.795
like how "lift" means elevator,

10:28.878 --> 10:30.422
and "fanny" means chooch!

10:30.505 --> 10:32.382
What else were you in charge of?

10:32.466 --> 10:35.343
I don't know! Keeping it fun over 50?

10:35.427 --> 10:36.928
Who else has the wrong date, Mimi?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.263
The venue!

10:38.346 --> 10:39.973
I gave it fancy to the venue!

10:40.056 --> 10:41.933
I left your dress at a restaurant

10:42.016 --> 10:43.702
and now it's gone
like so many steaming nugs.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.563
Oh, no, Kimmy ruined your party.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.046
What date did you give the vendors?

10:48.106 --> 10:49.316
Tonight. October 12th.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.733
I remembered it like this:

10:50.817 --> 10:51.943
October is Halloween month,

10:52.026 --> 10:54.112
and 12 is the spoo-ookiest number,

10:54.195 --> 10:55.280
minus one.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.698
So the flowers, decorations, catering...

10:57.782 --> 10:59.885
it'll all be waiting at a venue
that we have not booked!

10:59.909 --> 11:01.869
I did it the British way!

11:01.953 --> 11:03.455
That's what she said?

11:03.538 --> 11:04.414
No.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.582
I am afraid this time,

11:05.665 --> 11:07.459
she said nothing of the sort.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.043
Jacqueline!

11:09.127 --> 11:10.753
Thank you for your service.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.380
Keith, how'd you find me?

11:12.464 --> 11:13.881
Did you reposition a satellite

11:13.965 --> 11:15.509
to lock onto my coordinates?

11:15.592 --> 11:17.427
There's an address on this garment bag.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.262
Yeah. That's a bag.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.055
The dress is inside it.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.890
My brain is still mostly thinking about

11:22.974 --> 11:24.309
where IEDs could be hidden,

11:24.392 --> 11:26.685
like that pile of clearly empty boxes,

11:26.769 --> 11:30.106
so I went and forgot to ask a pretty girl
for her number.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.990
But maybe we could go out sometime?

11:39.073 --> 11:40.200
Get the digits!

11:41.742 --> 11:42.994
Hey, those are our speakers.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.372
No, you got the wrong day, man!

11:45.455 --> 11:47.748
No, those aren't for this event.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.920
Sweetie, well, thank God,
you didn't kill yourself,

11:53.004 --> 11:54.964
because I would have.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.091
And I know exactly how and when.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.760
Good news. I found out what went wrong.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.513
Your month and date were flipped.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.431
And "dinner" was spelled with a "U."

12:04.432 --> 12:07.477
How do you have Sting? I have Sting!

12:07.561 --> 12:09.437
I emailed him myself!

12:09.521 --> 12:11.189
Oh, my God. He's British.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.024
He flipped the date the other way.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.651
Why didn't I just say "October"?

12:14.733 --> 12:17.529
I know,
then none of this would be happening.

12:17.612 --> 12:20.365
I would be at home
getting ready for your event.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.701
Helping Reg put on his fun cuff links.

12:22.783 --> 12:24.543
Playing hide-and-go-seek
with a four-year-old

12:24.578 --> 12:25.953
who has never beaten me once.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.473
Then turning on the garbage disposal

12:27.497 --> 12:29.499
to cover my screams.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.459
Oh, no.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.711
The food. The flowers.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.170
They're gonna throw it all out!

12:34.254 --> 12:36.297
Why is someone with $11/2 billion

12:36.381 --> 12:39.634
so concerned about paying twice
for flowers?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.849
Because I don't have $11/2 billion
and you know it.

12:46.933 --> 12:47.850
I do.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.687
I mean, I didn't know-know, but I knew.

12:50.769 --> 12:52.980
Your feet aren't bleeding anywhere,

12:53.064 --> 12:55.942
which means
you've worn those shoes before.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.990
Look, Deirdre,
just give me the space tonight.

13:03.074 --> 13:06.077
Every penny I have is tied into this gala.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.538
Help me out,
and I'll do whatever you want.

13:08.622 --> 13:12.166
I'll gain ten pounds and wear the same
dress as you somewhere.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.792
I'll claim my farts in yoga.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.670
I'll claim all of 'em!

13:15.754 --> 13:17.505
What I want is for you to fight back!

13:17.589 --> 13:20.133
I watched you return to New York
with nothing

13:20.216 --> 13:22.885
and claw your way to the top,
and I thought,

13:22.969 --> 13:25.096
"Finally, here is the Raphael

13:25.179 --> 13:26.681
to my Michelangelo,

13:26.765 --> 13:29.183
the Leibniz to my Newton,

13:29.267 --> 13:33.146
the Lululemon to my Fabletics
by Kate Hudson!"

13:33.229 --> 13:34.981
Don't quit!

13:35.064 --> 13:37.150
"How dull it is to pause,

13:37.233 --> 13:38.443
to make an end,

13:38.526 --> 13:39.611
to rust unburnished,

13:39.694 --> 13:41.655
not to shine in use!"

13:41.738 --> 13:43.822
Unseat me as Alpha-Mom

13:43.906 --> 13:45.074
as I did Jenny Chamberlain

13:45.158 --> 13:49.036
at last year's Christmas Ho-Ho-Ho Down!

13:49.120 --> 13:50.789
You're insane.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.873
Jinx.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.843
My Nonno,
he insists on still having a garden.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.263
So I built him some window boxes
for his tomato plants,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.599
his basil, his mozzarella bush...

14:09.683 --> 14:12.393
Shoot. Those guys are from the site.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.396
Don't do anything gay.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.774
I said don't do anything gay!

14:17.856 --> 14:19.567
And don't stay stuff like "theater,"

14:19.651 --> 14:21.944
or "salad,"
or "Hey, let's all take a bath."

14:22.028 --> 14:23.422
You know what? Just let me do the talking.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.198
I'm used to that, #WentThere.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.242
You know I love your bitchy muttering,
but not now.

14:38.503 --> 14:39.796
'Sup?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.881
'Sup?

14:48.179 --> 14:50.223
- 'Sup?
- Soup.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.614
Eh.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.998
Just put the food in the fridge.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.125
I'm gonna have to live off that forever.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.420
I guess I should eat
all the oysters first.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.547
But then I'd be so horny!

15:22.630 --> 15:25.091
No, Jacqueline, you can't give up.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.803
Good things can happen
when you least expect it.

15:28.887 --> 15:31.598
You can go to the bathroom
and find a beautiful man.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.558
Yeah, but then you sober up and realize

15:33.641 --> 15:35.518
you're just going to town on a mop.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.645
Nothing good is going to happen!

15:37.729 --> 15:39.480
I have no venue, no entertainment,

15:39.564 --> 15:41.482
and worst of all, no donors.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.692
You have us.

15:42.776 --> 15:43.984
Ugh, why would you say that?

15:44.068 --> 15:45.612
You're making it worse.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.594
This isn't the first time
you've had nothing.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.827
When you moved to New York,

15:52.911 --> 15:54.430
you only had the clothes on your back,

15:54.454 --> 15:56.205
but by the time I met you,

15:56.289 --> 15:59.333
you used towels with your initials on them
as toilet paper.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.501
No, I didn't.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.503
No one did.

16:02.587 --> 16:03.838
That's what I'm saying.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.927
You did the impossible,
and you can do it again.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.010
Just think back.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.429
How did you do it the first time?

16:11.512 --> 16:13.765
Was it cocaine? For me it was cocaine.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.516
I didn't do anything.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.060
I was young and beautiful,
and I trapped a man.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.020
I don't have any skills.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.940
My only education is Snapple caps.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.858
An ostrich can run 30 miles an hour.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.485
What? No. Help!

16:26.861 --> 16:29.489
Don't answer it! It's an ostrich!

16:29.572 --> 16:31.240
What do you want, Deirdre?

16:31.324 --> 16:33.827
I want you to know
I am filling my maid's purse

16:33.910 --> 16:35.035
with silverware right now

16:35.119 --> 16:36.722
just to start something
that won't come close

16:36.746 --> 16:39.039
to what you and I almost had.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.125
- <i>I need you!</i>
- Why?

16:41.208 --> 16:43.210
I'm just a dumb country girl

16:43.294 --> 16:45.105
whose greatest accomplishment
is getting pregnant

16:45.129 --> 16:46.589
with a married man's child

16:46.673 --> 16:49.133
after scraping his sperm
off an airplane toilet.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.177
Ugh, fine. I give up.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.471
Go back to wherever mistresses come from.

16:53.554 --> 16:56.015
I want to say... Tampa?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.559
No, actually...

16:58.643 --> 17:02.188
That's not where they come from.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.315
Why are you talking like that?

17:04.397 --> 17:06.275
Do you have a plan?

17:06.358 --> 17:08.361
<i>Jacqueline?</i>

17:08.444 --> 17:10.069
My gala is back on.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.446
- Yes!
- I did it!

17:11.531 --> 17:12.699
We have a lot of work to do.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.492
Mimi, lock yourself in a closet.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.577
Way ahead of you, boss.

17:16.661 --> 17:19.079
Kimmy, get your gay friend over here
for flower arranging.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.415
What's his name? Tibor?

17:21.499 --> 17:22.959
Tringus! Sorry, I'm excited.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.084
Turdgun!

17:24.167 --> 17:25.545
Turdgun.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.672
We need all the help we can get.

17:35.346 --> 17:36.764
Hi, Keith, it's Kimmy.

17:36.848 --> 17:40.727
Cool outgoing message.
I will "Do my thing."

17:40.810 --> 17:42.037
Look, if you still want to get together,

17:42.061 --> 17:43.688
my boss is having a party tonight.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.606
What is this, Sadie Hawkins Day?

17:45.690 --> 17:46.941
It's not. I checked.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.401
It's kind of a grown-up party,

17:48.484 --> 17:50.862
so maybe you have a fancy uniform?

17:50.945 --> 17:52.363
It can be tight. It's fine.

17:52.446 --> 17:55.533
"Anyhoo," said the any owl...

17:55.616 --> 17:57.410
<i>If you are satisfied with your message,</i>

17:57.493 --> 17:59.537
<i>press one.</i>

17:59.620 --> 18:01.622
And, one.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.044
But then the wedding ring the doctor found

18:06.126 --> 18:07.545
wasn't even his.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.756
Listen up, side-pieces.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.257
My name is Jacqueline White,

18:11.340 --> 18:13.051
and I was once like you.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.052
Really?

18:14.134 --> 18:16.554
How many friends have you played
in a yogurt ad?

18:16.637 --> 18:19.057
Let her talk.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.559
She's the best I've ever seen.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.561
Oh. Hey, Sandra.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.355
Anyway...

18:26.439 --> 18:29.859
Tonight, we rise.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.574
What are you doing, Titus?
This looks terrible.

18:36.657 --> 18:37.909
I'm not the one who assumed

18:37.992 --> 18:39.827
all gay people know how
to arrange flowers.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.288
Why don't I ask you
to do some prop comedy, Carrot Top?

18:42.371 --> 18:44.331
If I had more time, you know I'd love to.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.876
I have a lot on my mind right now.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.753
It turns out, around other people,

18:48.836 --> 18:50.797
Mikey doesn't talk at all.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.757
Do you understand what that means?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.008
He's not just babbling,

18:54.092 --> 18:55.885
he's trying to open up to me.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.054
He doesn't have anyone else
he can talk to.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.765
Wow, that's a big responsibility.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.934
Because listening to someone,

19:03.017 --> 19:06.520
really listening to them,
means not just hearing,

19:06.604 --> 19:09.189
but actually taking in
what the other person is telling you.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.692
And... Hey, not cool, Titus.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.527
Put 'em back!

19:13.611 --> 19:15.822
I have to save my ear energy for Mikey.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.865
For him, I will be a listener.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.076
It will be my toughest role ever.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.428
And I once played a straight corpse

19:21.452 --> 19:23.621
on <i>America's Most Wanted.</i>

19:29.836 --> 19:31.004
Deirdre!

19:31.087 --> 19:32.171
You look lovely.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.673
You came.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.424
So you do have a plan.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.884
Are you here to kill me?

19:36.968 --> 19:38.886
A plan? Please.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.847
I don't even have a venue.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.473
Or do I?

19:43.933 --> 19:46.435
<i>Obviously, my loft isn't perfect,</i>

19:46.519 --> 19:51.149
<i>but a mistress knows how to make
a $10 gown look couture.</i>

19:55.069 --> 19:57.030
Who the hell is that?

19:57.113 --> 19:58.781
I smell a man!

20:00.240 --> 20:01.784
Too bad it's not a real gala

20:01.868 --> 20:03.786
without a celebrity entertainer.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.038
Or do I?

20:05.121 --> 20:06.998
<i>I landed acclaimed performer</i>

20:07.081 --> 20:09.249
<i>and face-hider, Sia.</i>

20:09.333 --> 20:10.686
<i>At least, that's what my guests will think</i>

20:10.710 --> 20:12.962
<i>when Mimi Kanassis lip-syncs "Chandelier."</i>

20:13.046 --> 20:14.672
<i>Not bad.</i>

20:14.755 --> 20:16.883
But the only thing
that's really important at a gala

20:16.966 --> 20:18.092
is the Benjamins.

20:18.176 --> 20:19.301
And the Phillips.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.929
And all the other rich men
with WASPy names.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.347
But sadly, they're here.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.391
Oh, but I've got them, Deirdre.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.143
I've got them all.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.479
And you planted the idea seed
into my brain garden.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.356
The mistresses.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.193
Ladies, I know what you want
more than anything.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.403
- A reality show?
- His wife explodes?

20:37.486 --> 20:39.072
No, what you want most

20:39.155 --> 20:41.240
is one romantic night out with your man.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.576
But Walter is very romantic.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.869
He bought me perfume,

20:44.952 --> 20:46.954
the same as his wife's.

20:48.164 --> 20:52.001
Oh, it's so he never smells like
another woman.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.669
Walter is so smart.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.005
What if you could have
a real night out together?

20:56.089 --> 20:57.423
Go to a fancy party?

20:57.506 --> 20:59.050
Meet his friends,

20:59.133 --> 21:01.177
instead of just being wheeled
into his hotel room

21:01.260 --> 21:04.013
inside a housekeeping cart?

21:04.097 --> 21:05.305
What would you do

21:05.389 --> 21:06.807
to make that happen?

21:07.975 --> 21:10.103
Every man has some weird fantasy

21:10.186 --> 21:12.312
he tosses out there like it's no big deal.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.522
Reg wants me to pretend

21:13.606 --> 21:15.524
we're on a hard-to-hear conference call.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.401
But a good mistress knows to withhold it

21:17.484 --> 21:19.112
until the time is right.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.363
And that time is now.

21:22.865 --> 21:25.785
Oh, no, there's an emergency at work.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.954
I have to go to work! Now!

21:28.037 --> 21:29.663
And I need your cane!

21:41.675 --> 21:43.803
I've never been so humiliated.

21:43.886 --> 21:46.889
My God. I've never failed before.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.225
The pain is...

21:49.308 --> 21:50.977
exquisite.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.520
Oh, thank you, Jacqueline.

22:32.935 --> 22:35.271
Brava, Jacqueline.

22:35.353 --> 22:37.315
Have you met Naomi, my...

22:37.397 --> 22:39.066
friend from work?

22:40.818 --> 22:42.195
So what are you up to tomorrow?

22:42.278 --> 22:43.922
I was thinking we could go
see a horror movie

22:43.946 --> 22:45.990
and laugh at what people think is scary.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.492
"Oh, no, that little girl is singing

22:48.575 --> 22:51.037
a nursery rhyme too slowly!"

22:51.120 --> 22:54.498
"Look out! It's a weird house!"

22:57.543 --> 23:00.046
"Eek! A sound!"

23:01.047 --> 23:02.798
So if someone tells me that drywall

23:02.882 --> 23:05.176
is neither dry, nor a wall,

23:05.259 --> 23:06.426
that would be a lie?

23:06.510 --> 23:08.221
Exactly, 'cause it's both.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.306
Oh. Fascinating.

23:10.388 --> 23:11.557
Do go on.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.766
Well, speaking of drywall,

23:12.850 --> 23:14.894
I just redid my sister Theresa's house...

23:14.977 --> 23:16.697
She's the one that married a fireman,
right?

23:16.770 --> 23:18.064
Yes, but no.

23:18.147 --> 23:19.940
I actually have two sisters named Theresa,

23:20.024 --> 23:21.817
one with an "H," and one without,

23:21.901 --> 23:24.028
and they both married firemen...

23:24.111 --> 23:26.446
I can't do this.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.574
Why do you keep making me talk?

23:28.657 --> 23:31.285
What? You keep making me listen.

23:31.369 --> 23:32.995
- Are you serious, bro?
- Yes.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.140
I saw how you were
with the other contraption workers.

23:35.164 --> 23:38.209
I thought you've finally found someone
you can open up to...

23:38.292 --> 23:39.960
Titus Andromedon,

23:40.044 --> 23:42.462
a well into which you can pour
your emotional water.

23:42.546 --> 23:45.216
You don't pour water into a well!

23:45.299 --> 23:46.842
Look, I don't talk to the guys at work

23:46.926 --> 23:48.510
'cause I don't know them.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.179
It's too loud to have a conversation

23:50.263 --> 23:51.847
around all that equipment.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.158
The digger thing and the smushers

23:53.182 --> 23:54.934
and the crashy balls.

23:55.017 --> 23:58.354
Honestly, I'm not a big talker, period.

23:58.436 --> 24:00.522
But on our first date,
I was really nervous,

24:00.606 --> 24:03.317
so I was talking a lot,
and that's the guy you fell for.

24:03.401 --> 24:06.528
So I've just been trying to be that guy.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.991
You did that for me?

24:11.075 --> 24:12.952
And you kept listening.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.037
For me.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.335
It's good to know
that if I ever do need to talk...

24:21.419 --> 24:22.586
Shh, shh, shh.

24:22.669 --> 24:24.922
We just moved past this.

24:25.505 --> 24:26.840
I'm just gonna live as Sia now.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.801
Everybody likes me.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.929
- Incoming!
- Let go of me, old man!

24:33.513 --> 24:35.557
They're inside the wire!

24:35.641 --> 24:37.977
I'm gonna rip your beard off!

24:43.649 --> 24:45.401
What the Hellmann's Mayonnaise was that?

24:45.483 --> 24:46.526
I'm sorry. I freaked out.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.737
Sometimes loud noises can trigger...

24:48.821 --> 24:50.030
stuff.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.532
I mean, you started punching me.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.576
A totally normal reaction to being grabbed

24:54.660 --> 24:56.287
by some psycho with a beard.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.038
I don't have a...

24:58.122 --> 24:59.308
If you think you don't have triggers,

24:59.332 --> 25:00.582
then you're in denial.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.876
Uh, you mean the river in Egypt?

25:02.960 --> 25:04.502
Well, you're in a different river.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.256
The Euphrates,
'cause you 'fraidy a bunch of stuff!

25:07.340 --> 25:08.733
Kimmy, after what we've been through,

25:08.757 --> 25:10.968
just because you're out
doesn't mean it's out of you.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.178
That's not true.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.680
If you're tough,
you leave that stuff in...

25:15.889 --> 25:16.723
Past.

25:16.807 --> 25:18.910
And if it tries to get out,
you just lock it up forever,

25:18.934 --> 25:20.269
in a bunker, like a Kimmy!

25:20.353 --> 25:22.104
- Kimmy, slow down a sec.
- No.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.897
I don't have time to slow down.

25:23.981 --> 25:25.232
I've missed too much already.

25:25.316 --> 25:26.317
Seven Olympics.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.120
Jonathan Taylor Thomas
making the transition

25:28.152 --> 25:30.029
to adult movie star, I assume.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.447
Fifteen Christmases!

25:31.529 --> 25:33.073
Okay, but my point is,

25:33.157 --> 25:35.742
you're never gonna get
those Christmases back.

25:35.826 --> 25:38.329
Oh, really? 'Cause get this.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.247
Wait for it...

25:40.331 --> 25:43.209
I'm having a Christmas a week.
Starting tomorrow.

25:43.292 --> 25:46.295
Does that sound like someone
who's in denial?

25:46.379 --> 25:48.881
Tomorrow's Christmas, everybody!

25:48.964 --> 25:51.675
And I've got a chimney to dig.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.893
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:00.976 --> 26:02.686
thank you for coming to support

26:02.769 --> 26:05.398
First Americans for Turtle Island.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.649
When the Pilgrims landed
in the New World...

26:10.736 --> 26:14.407
Okay, but when the Pilgrims landed,

26:14.490 --> 26:17.617
they continued the mistreatment
of indigenous peoples

26:17.701 --> 26:19.203
started by Columbus.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.829
Wait, what is this gala for?

26:20.913 --> 26:22.498
I saw "First Americans" and assumed

26:22.580 --> 26:24.500
it was some kind of super-PAC.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.710
And I thought it was for Turtle Island,

26:26.793 --> 26:28.188
that private island
where people like me go

26:28.212 --> 26:30.423
to dress like turtles
and do stuff to turtles.

26:30.506 --> 26:31.631
What?

26:31.715 --> 26:33.842
No, this is to benefit Native Americans,

26:33.926 --> 26:35.593
and to resolve hundreds of years of...

26:35.677 --> 26:36.554
Hold on.

26:36.636 --> 26:38.198
We didn't get rich by throwing money away.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.682
We give to causes that actually affect us.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.101
Prostate cancer.

26:42.184 --> 26:43.894
Schools for our dumb kids to get into.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.646
The arts, 'cause of
all of those old nudie paintings.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.941
What do these Native people
have to do with us?

26:49.024 --> 26:51.818
This isn't about you.
It's about injustice!

26:51.902 --> 26:54.530
When the Dutch bought this country
in 1626...

26:58.033 --> 26:59.868
They paid only $24.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.370
Does that seem fair?

27:01.454 --> 27:04.164
Actually,
if the Lenape had invested that money

27:04.248 --> 27:06.208
starting in 1626...

27:06.292 --> 27:08.377
Let's see, the rule of seven and two,

27:08.461 --> 27:11.505
doubling roughly every eight years...

27:11.589 --> 27:13.424
Today, that $24 would be

27:13.507 --> 27:16.385
$8.6 septillion.

27:16.469 --> 27:18.804
Sounds like it's the Dutch
who got screwed.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.181
Like a turtle caught in a sex net.

27:21.265 --> 27:22.391
Oh, God.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.518
You don't care at all.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.479
Why didn't I see it?

27:26.562 --> 27:27.980
That's always been the problem.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.607
You just don't care.

27:31.649 --> 27:34.487
Congratulations.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.196
10,000 years running,

27:36.280 --> 27:38.991
and you don't care about anyone else
but yourselves.

27:39.074 --> 27:42.411
Hey, how'd you know
the Goldman Sachs cheer?

27:51.878 --> 27:53.172
I failed.

28:01.679 --> 28:03.098
I can't hear anything,

28:03.182 --> 28:04.891
so I'm gonna assume that was my cue.

28:04.975 --> 28:07.520
Also, iTunes suspended my account,

28:07.603 --> 28:09.813
so I'm gonna have to wing it.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.649
Cha-cha-cha, cha-cha, cha-cha...

28:11.773 --> 28:13.651
<i>♪ Chandelier ♪</i>

28:13.733 --> 28:15.444

28:19.532 --> 28:21.783

28:23.827 --> 28:28.040
And that's why I always felt
like I didn't deserve my father's love!

28:28.123 --> 28:31.709
One day I'm gonna marry
this wheelbarrow. That's my deal!

28:32.169 --> 28:34.796
I'm in love with a black, gay man!

28:34.880 --> 28:40.093
Whoa! I just said "love."
That's scary. But exciting!

28:41.428 --> 28:44.139
I get turned on by setting fires!

28:46.642 --> 28:49.895
I have a tail! A little tail!

30:03.009 --> 30:04.970
