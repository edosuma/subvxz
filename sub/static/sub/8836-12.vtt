YEAH?

01:38.850 --> 01:40.435
BREAKFAST.

01:41.352 --> 01:44.063
OH, YEAH. COMING.

01:47.567 --> 01:50.403
I SWEAR, THAT BOY JUST FORGETS
THE TIME WHEN HE'S READING.

01:50.570 --> 01:52.030
YEAH, HE SURE DOES.

01:52.197 --> 01:54.908
YOU KNOW, A BOY THAT AGE OUGHT
TO GET OUT MORE AND DO THINGS.

01:55.074 --> 01:57.619
OH, HIS PA LOVED BOOKS,
AND SO DOES THE BOY.

01:57.786 --> 01:59.496
THERE'S A LOT
OF PLEASURE IN READING.

01:59.662 --> 02:01.289
YEAH, WELL,
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

02:01.456 --> 02:03.583
HERE, I'LL DO THIS
FOR YOU.

02:03.750 --> 02:04.959
OK.

02:22.435 --> 02:23.269
NEED A HAND?

02:23.436 --> 02:25.104
NO. I GOT IT.

02:27.273 --> 02:29.108
THIS IS A FINE BOOK.

02:29.275 --> 02:31.694
HAVE YOU EVER READ
LORD BYRON?

02:31.861 --> 02:35.198
LORD BYRON? WHAT DO
THEY CALL HIM LORD FOR?

02:35.365 --> 02:36.616
THAT WAS HIS TITLE.

02:36.783 --> 02:37.617
OH.

02:37.784 --> 02:40.078
HE WAS MY FATHER'S
FAVORITE.

02:40.245 --> 02:42.622
WELL, YOU BEST GET IN THE
HOUSE, GET SOME BREAKFAST.

02:42.789 --> 02:45.834
IMAGINE EVEN LORD BYRON
TOOK TIME OUT TO EAT.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.212
ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU REALLY
OUGHT TO READ IT SOMETIME.

02:49.379 --> 02:51.673
WELL, I WILL.
I WILL.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.436
WHEW!

03:06.604 --> 03:07.564
THAT'S FINE
SHOOTING, SIR.

03:07.730 --> 03:09.065
MIGHTY FINE
SHOOTING.

03:09.232 --> 03:10.316
WHY, A MAN COULD SHOOT
THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE

03:10.483 --> 03:11.442
WITH A RIFLE LIKE THIS.

03:11.609 --> 03:13.862
THAT'S A GENUINE
WINCHESTER 73,

03:14.028 --> 03:16.239
FIRES A .44-40 CARTRIDGE.

03:16.406 --> 03:18.575
OH, YOU CAN'T DO
BETTER THAN THIS RIFLE,

03:18.741 --> 03:19.492
I'LL TELL YOU.

03:19.659 --> 03:22.120
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, CHARLES?

03:22.287 --> 03:24.998
IT'S A DANDY.
HOW MUCH IS IT?

03:25.164 --> 03:28.126
WELL, A RIFLE LIKE THIS
DOESN'T COME CHEAP.

03:28.293 --> 03:29.377
Isaiah:
WELL, HOW MUCH?

03:29.544 --> 03:33.006
$7.50, BUT LOOK
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING--

03:33.172 --> 03:36.509
A WALNUT STOCK, SPORTING
FRONT AND REAR SIGHTS.

03:36.676 --> 03:38.636
WELL, I CAN
SEE ALL THAT.

03:38.803 --> 03:40.597
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO
SPEND ON A BOY'S BIRTHDAY.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.891
[SIGHS]
YEAH, <i>I</i> KNOW.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.685
WELL, I GOT PLENTY
OF OTHER RIFLES.

03:45.852 --> 03:47.103
NOW, LET ME SEE.

03:47.270 --> 03:50.189
I COULD GIVE YOU A GOVERNMENT
SPRINGFIELD FOR 2.90,

03:50.356 --> 03:54.193
WITH 20 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION THROWN IN.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

03:54.360 --> 03:55.486
WELL...

03:55.653 --> 03:58.406
OH, THAT RIFLE WILL WEIGH
MORE THAN THE BOY DOES.

03:58.573 --> 04:00.491
COME ON, LET'S GO SEE
WHERE I HIT THAT THING.

04:05.496 --> 04:07.040
YEAH, I KNOW IT'S A LOT
OF MONEY TO SPEND,

04:07.206 --> 04:09.500
BUT I WANT JOHN JR. TO GET
THE RIGHT KIND OF START,

04:09.667 --> 04:10.543
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

04:10.710 --> 04:11.628
I KNOW.

04:11.794 --> 04:13.546
CAN'T GET THAT BOY
OUT OF DOORS.

04:13.713 --> 04:15.798
FINISHES HIS CHORES, HE'S
OFF UP TO THAT TREE HOUSE

04:15.965 --> 04:17.216
JUST READING
AND WRITING.

04:17.383 --> 04:18.468
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD
IN THAT, TOO, YOU KNOW.

04:18.635 --> 04:20.053
YEAH, I KNOW.
I KNOW.

04:20.219 --> 04:21.888
IT'S JUST IF I'M GOING TO
BE A FATHER TO THAT BOY,

04:22.055 --> 04:23.723
WELL, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
SPEND MORE TIME WITH HIM,

04:23.890 --> 04:25.725
AND I DON'T MEAN WORK TIME,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

04:25.892 --> 04:27.977
I WANT HIM TO LIKE SOME
OF THE THINGS I LIKE.

04:28.144 --> 04:31.272
HEY, WILL YOU LOOK
AT THAT?

04:31.439 --> 04:35.026
THAT AIN'T BUT A HALF INCH OFF
WHERE I LAID THEM SIGHTS. HEH HEH!

04:35.193 --> 04:36.444
WELL, THAT SETTLES IT.

04:36.611 --> 04:39.906
MY SON'S GOT HIMSELF
A GENUINE WINCHESTER 73.

04:40.073 --> 04:43.534
MR. THOMS, YOU MADE
YOURSELF A SALE!

04:46.871 --> 04:47.997
HOO!

05:03.721 --> 05:06.391
HEY, UH, HA HA!

05:06.557 --> 05:09.560
JUST FINE. YOU MUST HAVE
HAD A WONDERFUL DAY.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.062
OH, I DID.
IT WAS A PIP.

05:11.229 --> 05:12.647

05:12.814 --> 05:13.815
NOW, WHERE DO YOU
THINK HE IS?

05:13.982 --> 05:15.024
HE'S NOT HOME
FROM SCHOOL YET.

05:15.191 --> 05:16.651
OH, YEAH.
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

05:16.818 --> 05:18.611
LOOKY THERE. WRAPPED
THAT UP MY OWN SELF.

05:18.778 --> 05:20.446
OH, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL ME THAT.
WHAT IS IT?

05:20.613 --> 05:22.615
WELL, I AIN'T GONNA TELL YOU.
IT'S A SURPRISE.

05:22.782 --> 05:24.158
TODAY'S NOT MY BIRTHDAY,
IT'S JOHN'S.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.827
STILL AND ALL, I AIN'T
GONNA SAY NOTHIN'.

05:25.994 --> 05:28.621
SUIT YOURSELF. I WON'T TELL
YOU WHAT I GOT HIM EITHER.

05:28.788 --> 05:30.123
NOW, HURRY UP AND
GET OUT OF THIS KITCHEN

05:30.289 --> 05:32.000
SO I CAN GET THE DECORATING
DONE ON THIS CAKE!

05:32.166 --> 05:34.168
OUT OF HERE!
GET GOING!

05:34.335 --> 05:36.671
I'LL BET HE LIKES MY PRESENT
BETTER THAN HE LIKES YOURS.

05:36.838 --> 05:39.340
OH, ISAIAH!
YOU'RE TERRIBLE.

05:39.507 --> 05:42.010
I KNOW! HA HA. I'M GOING
TO UNHITCH THE TEAM.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.636
[GRACE GIGGLES]

05:43.803 --> 05:47.015
"ROLL ON, THOU DEEP
AND DARK BLUE OCEAN, ROLL.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.642
"10,000 FLEETS

05:51.769 --> 05:53.896
HIS CONTROL STOPS
WITH THE SHORE."

05:54.063 --> 05:55.481
DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU
WANT TO SEE THE OCEAN?

05:55.648 --> 05:57.650
MAKES ME WANT TO STICK
MY TOES IN PLUM CREEK.

05:57.817 --> 05:59.652
MY FEET ARE SWEATING.
SO ARE MINE.

05:59.819 --> 06:01.029
COME ON,
I'LL RACE YOU!

06:01.195 --> 06:02.530
WAIT FOR ME!

06:02.697 --> 06:05.033
THEY JUST DON'T APPRECIATE
POETRY, I GUESS.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.118
NEITHER DID I
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

06:07.285 --> 06:08.870
YOU KNOW, I WISH I COULD
WRITE SOMETHING SOMEDAY

06:09.037 --> 06:11.998
THAT WOULD MAKE PEOPLE FEEL
SOMETHING INSIDE, LIKE LORD BYRON.

06:12.165 --> 06:14.375
YOU WILL.
I KNOW YOU WILL.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.836
I SURE HOPE SO. OH, DON'T
FORGET TO ASK YOUR PA

06:17.003 --> 06:18.463
IF I COULD BORROW
HIS COPY OF EMERSON.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.173
I WON'T FORGET.

06:20.339 --> 06:21.215
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:21.382 --> 06:22.175
WHAT?

06:22.341 --> 06:23.551
MY FEET ARE
KIND OF HOT, TOO.

06:23.718 --> 06:24.594
I'LL RACE YOU!

06:24.761 --> 06:26.179
OK.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.456
Carl: BLOW OUT THE CANDLES
So AS WE CAN EAT IT, JOHN.

06:53.623 --> 06:56.626
WAIT A MINUTE.
I GOT TO MAKE A WISH.

[ALL LAUGH]

07:02.715 --> 07:06.094
Isaiah: JOHN, UM, FIRST THE
PRESENTS, THEN THE CAKE.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.138
WHOOP! NOT THAT ONE NOW.
YOU GOT OTHERS TO OPEN.

07:09.305 --> 07:12.391
YOU OPEN THIS ONE LAST.
HERE, TRY THAT ONE THERE.

07:13.518 --> 07:14.644
BETTER MOVE THE CAKE.

07:17.063 --> 07:18.648
"FROM CARL AND ALICIA."

07:18.815 --> 07:19.774
I DIDN'T GET HIM
ANYTHING.

07:19.941 --> 07:21.526
OH, I PICKED OUT
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

07:21.692 --> 07:22.568
THEN HURRY UP
AND OPEN IT.

07:22.735 --> 07:24.487
I WANT TO SEE
WHAT I GOT YOU.

07:33.412 --> 07:34.580
Carl: I KNEW
YOU'D LIKE IT.

07:34.747 --> 07:35.998
WASN'T
TALKING TO YOU.

07:36.165 --> 07:38.251
HERE, TRY THAT ONE.

07:42.505 --> 07:46.425
"TO SOMEONE VERY SPECIAL
ON THEIR BIRTHDAY.

07:46.592 --> 07:48.803
LOVE, GRACE."

OH, THANK YOU!

08:01.482 --> 08:04.318
UH...HEY, HEY, YOU
GOT ANOTHER ONE HERE.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.198

08:09.365 --> 08:12.326
OH, YEAH, WELL, I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY. OPEN IT.

WELL, LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S GOT A WALNUT STOCK,

08:42.148 --> 08:44.483
SPORTING FRONT,

08:44.650 --> 08:47.403
WHY, YOU CAN'T GET
A BETTER RIFLE THAN THAT.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.905
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:49.071 --> 08:52.158
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

08:52.325 --> 08:54.202
WELL,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

08:54.368 --> 08:55.828
WELL...l MEAN,

08:55.995 --> 08:59.248
ISN'T IT TOO EXPENSIVE? IT
MUST HAVE COST YOU DEAR.

08:59.415 --> 09:02.627
OH, DON'T YOU WORRY NONE
ABOUT WHAT THE COST WAS.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.838
YOU SEE THAT? HE HAD ME FOOLED THERE.
THOUGHT HE DIDN'T LIKE IT.

09:06.005 --> 09:06.923
HEY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

09:07.089 --> 09:08.674
COME SATURDAY MORNING,
YOU AND ME,

09:08.841 --> 09:10.009
WE'RE GONNA GO OUT AND HAVE
OURSELVES A LITTLE HUNTING TRIP.

09:10.176 --> 09:12.220
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

09:12.386 --> 09:14.263
SOUNDS FINE.

09:14.430 --> 09:15.431
CAN I COME, TOO?

09:15.598 --> 09:16.974
WELL, WE'LL HAVE
TO SEE ABOUT THAT.

09:17.141 --> 09:18.643
YOU KNOW, THERE'S TIMES
WHEN THE OLDER MENFOLKS

09:18.809 --> 09:21.812
LIKE TO GET OFF BY THEMSELVES.
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, JOHN?

09:21.979 --> 09:23.522
YES, SIR.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.566
WELL, YOU MENFOLK CAN
JUST TALK ABOUT THAT LATER.

09:25.733 --> 09:29.654
RIGHT NOW I WANT TO GET THIS CAKE
CUT AND SERVED BEFORE IT GETS OLD.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.072

10:20.371 --> 10:22.456

KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?

10:22.623 --> 10:25.293
IT'S GONNA BE
MORNING IN A FEW HOURS.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.421
I COULDN'T HELP IT.
I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.631
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU LIKE IT,

10:30.798 --> 10:33.509
BUT I'M TURNING OUT
THE LIGHT ANYWAY.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.763
NOW YOU GET
TO SLEEP, YOUNG MAN.

10:38.681 --> 10:40.266
GRACE...

10:41.767 --> 10:43.144
YES?

10:43.311 --> 10:45.813
I WISH HE HADN'T SPENT
ALL THAT MONEY ON THE GUN.

10:45.980 --> 10:47.940
OH, I KNOW.

10:49.859 --> 10:52.445
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HIM TONIGHT.

10:52.611 --> 10:55.031
I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT HIM.

10:55.197 --> 10:57.658
I'M NOT SAYING
OTHER FOLKS SHOULDN'T,

10:57.825 --> 11:00.536
BUT I COULDN'T--
I COULDN'T KILL ANYTHING.

11:01.537 --> 11:03.622
WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT HUNTING BEFORE.

11:03.789 --> 11:06.375
HE MUST KNOW HOW I FEEL.

11:06.542 --> 11:09.920
BUT HE JUST PRETENDS
HE DOESN'T HEAR ME.

11:10.087 --> 11:13.966
WELL...YOU KNOW, ISAIAH
WAS RAISED IN THE WOODS.

11:14.133 --> 11:18.054
HE'S BEEN HUNTING ALL HIS
LIFE, FOR FOOD AND CLOTHING.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.430
I KNOW THAT, BUT...

11:19.597 --> 11:23.392
HE JUST WANTS YOU
TO BE LIKE HIM.

11:23.559 --> 11:26.812
HE WANTS TO SHARE THE THING
THAT HE DOES THE BEST.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.147
HE LOVES YOU.

11:28.314 --> 11:30.691
I KNOW THAT.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.443
BUT I CAN'T BE LIKE HIM,

11:32.610 --> 11:34.612
NOT ABOUT EVERYTHING.

11:35.946 --> 11:38.157
NOT ABOUT HUNTING.

11:38.324 --> 11:41.577
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO TELL HIM COME SATURDAY.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.788
WELL...

11:44.997 --> 11:46.499
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.416
WOULD YOU?

11:47.583 --> 11:50.086
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

11:50.252 --> 11:52.046
THANK YOU.

11:57.218 --> 11:59.220
I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

12:21.075 --> 12:21.909
PA!

12:22.076 --> 12:23.536
YEAH.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.830
I PROMISED JOHN I'D ASK IF HE COULD
BORROW YOUR COPY OF EMERSON.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.081
AS LONG AS HE'S
CAREFUL WITH IT.

12:27.248 --> 12:28.249
OH, HE WILL BE.

12:28.416 --> 12:29.625
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.211
THANK YOU. HE'S GOING
TO BE A POET SOMEDAY.

12:32.378 --> 12:33.462
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

12:33.629 --> 12:35.339
I THINK SO, TOO.
SEE YA!

12:35.506 --> 12:37.258
SEE YA!

12:39.385 --> 12:41.262
HOW OLD DO YOU HAVE
TO BE TO BE A POET?

12:41.429 --> 12:42.513
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
ANY AGE.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.931
DO YOU HAVE TO GO TO
COLLEGE TO BE ONE?

12:44.098 --> 12:45.141
NO, NO. EMERSON
WROTE ABOUT IT

12:45.307 --> 12:46.600
IN THAT BOOK
YOU'RE BRINGING TO JOHN.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.353
HE SAID THERE ARE TWO
CLASSES OF POETS:

12:49.520 --> 12:51.439
POETS BY EDUCATION
AND PRACTICE--

12:51.605 --> 12:52.898
THOSE WE RESPECT--

12:53.065 --> 12:55.818
AND POETS BY NATURE--
THOSE WE LOVE.

12:56.986 --> 13:00.114
THE LAST ONE--
THAT'S JOHN.

13:02.241 --> 13:03.993
THOSE WE LOVE, HUH?

13:05.744 --> 13:07.496
I GOT TO GO.
I'LL BE LATE!

13:14.462 --> 13:17.590
Alicia: YOU STAY HOME.
YOU CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.133
Grace:
WHO FORGOT HIS LUNCH?

13:19.300 --> 13:21.010
Carl: OH, I DID.

13:21.177 --> 13:22.052
Grace: HAVE A GOOD DAY.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.971
Carl: YES'M.

13:24.138 --> 13:25.639
JOHN, DON'T YOU WORRY
NONE ABOUT YOUR CHORES.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.350
I'LL HAVE 'EM DONE
BY THE TIME YOU GET HOME.

13:28.517 --> 13:29.602
THERE'S
NO NEED FOR THAT.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.061
I WANT YOU TO GET
RIGHT TO YOUR HOMEWORK

13:31.228 --> 13:33.230
SO WE CAN LEAVE BRIGHT AND
EARLY IN THE MORNING.

13:36.317 --> 13:39.111
CAN I COME, TOO? I'LL GET
ALL MY HOMEWORK DONE.

13:39.278 --> 13:40.070
PLEASE, PA?

13:40.237 --> 13:41.280
WELL,
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

13:41.447 --> 13:43.240
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.576
Isaiah: OH, HOLD ON, NOW. WE'VE HAD
OUR TRIPS OFF BY OURSELF, HAVEN'T WE?

13:45.743 --> 13:46.911
YEAH, BUT..

13:47.077 --> 13:48.370
ALL RIGHT. NOW IT'S
YOUR BROTHER'S TURN.

13:48.537 --> 13:51.123
NOW YOU GET ON TO SCHOOL
BEFORE I PULL YOUR EARS OFF.

13:51.290 --> 13:52.458
NEXT TIME FOR SURE?

13:52.625 --> 13:53.501
FOR SURE.

13:53.667 --> 13:54.919
OK.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.512
HEH HEH. THAT LITTLE CARL SURE DOES
LIKE IT OFF IN THE WOODS, DOESN'T HE?

14:04.678 --> 14:06.138
HE CERTAINLY DOES.

14:06.305 --> 14:08.724
WELL, MAYBE
I'LL TAKE HIM NEXT TIME.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.100
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HIM
WITH YOU THIS TIME?

14:10.267 --> 14:13.020
OH, NO. CAN'T DO THAT.
PROMISED JOHN JR.

14:13.187 --> 14:14.980
SAID IT WOULD
JUST BE THE TWO OF US.

14:15.147 --> 14:17.775
YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T MAKE
THAT PROMISE FOR YOURSELF?

14:17.942 --> 14:19.485
NOW, WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

14:19.652 --> 14:22.655
WELL, I JUST MEAN THAT I'M NOT
SO SURE THAT JOHN WANTS TO GO.

14:22.821 --> 14:25.449
WELL, OF COURSE HE WANTS TO GO.
HE LOVES IT OUT IN THE WOODS.

14:25.616 --> 14:28.577
HE LOVES
THE WOODS, ISAIAH,

14:28.744 --> 14:31.497
BUT HE DOESN'T
LOVE TO HUNT.

14:31.664 --> 14:33.582
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO SHOOT ANYTHING.

14:33.749 --> 14:37.002
WELL, HOW DO
YOU KNOW THAT?

14:37.169 --> 14:39.255
HE TOLD ME
LAST NIGHT.

14:40.339 --> 14:41.549
WELL, THAT DON'T
MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.467
I MEAN, LOOK HOW HAPPY
HE WAS WITH THE RIFLE.

14:43.634 --> 14:46.720
YOU WERE HAPPY, AND HE
DIDN'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.350
WELL, I'LL BE.

14:51.517 --> 14:53.727
HE'S A BOY.
I JUST, UH...

14:53.894 --> 14:55.729
FIGURED
HE'D LOVE TO HUNT.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.398
OH, DON'T FEEL BAD.

14:57.565 --> 15:00.025
NO, I DON'T.
IT'S JUST...

15:00.192 --> 15:04.655
JUST DON'T KNOW THAT BOY AS
WELL AS I THOUGHT I DID.

15:04.822 --> 15:06.532
WELL, NEVER NO MIND.

15:06.699 --> 15:08.075
I GUESS CARL'S BIG ENOUGH
TO CARRY THAT WINCHESTER.

15:08.242 --> 15:09.577
BESIDES THAT,
HE WANTS TO GO WITH ME.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.954
WELL, ISAIAH, JOHN JR.
DOES WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

15:12.121 --> 15:14.915
OH, WHAT FOR? ALL HE DOES IS READ AND
WRITE THAT POETRY OF HIS ALL THE TIME.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.292
NOW, DON'T BE
UPSET WITH HIM.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.002
NO, I'M NOT,
I'M NOT. IT'S JUST...

15:18.168 --> 15:19.378
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
THE THINGS I LIKE.

15:19.545 --> 15:20.879
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE THINGS HE LIKES.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.548
THERE AIN'T MUCH
I CAN DO ABOUT THAT.

15:22.715 --> 15:24.883
I GOT
WORK TO DO. HYAH!

15:36.270 --> 15:37.813
HO!

15:37.980 --> 15:39.064
MORNING, LEN!

15:39.231 --> 15:41.275
MORNING,
EDWARDS.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.154
Isaiah: HOW ARE YOU?

15:45.321 --> 15:46.905
FINE. FINE.
YOURSELF?

15:47.072 --> 15:48.282
COULDN'T
BE BETTER. TAD?

15:48.449 --> 15:49.575
HELLO, SIR.

15:49.742 --> 15:52.077
YOU BETTER GET TO UNLOADING
THAT WAGON, TAD.

15:52.244 --> 15:53.579
GLAD YOU GOT HERE,
EDWARDS.

15:53.746 --> 15:55.623
WE'RE ABOUT TO WORK
OURSELVES OUT OF MATERIALS.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.625
WELL, I DIDN'T FIGURE YOU'D
GET TO IT THIS QUICK.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.918
WELL, THERE WAS A PRETTY GOOD
CHILL IN THE AIR LAST NIGHT.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.086
BOY AND I DECIDED
IT'S A GOOD TIME

16:01.253 --> 16:03.756
TO GET STARTED
GETTING SOME VENISON.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.341
OH, THAT
SOUNDS GOOD.

16:05.507 --> 16:06.467
YEAH, I KEPT HIM
OUT OF SCHOOL

16:06.634 --> 16:08.385
SO AS WE CAN
GET THIS JOB FINISHED.

16:08.552 --> 16:12.014
HE'LL LEARN MORE IN THE WOODS THAN
HE WOULD IN THAT SCHOOLROOM ANYWAY.

16:12.181 --> 16:13.432
YEAH,
I SUPPOSE HE WILL.

16:13.599 --> 16:17.311
SAY, I HEARD YOU GOT YOU
A FINE RIFLE THE OTHER DAY.

16:17.478 --> 16:20.105
YEAH, I DID. IT'S
A GENUINE WINCHESTER.

16:20.272 --> 16:21.273
GOT IT FOR JOHN JR.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.859
OOH. BET
HE'S EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.944
YEAH. YEAH, HE IS.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.780
HAD A CHANCE
TO USE IT YET?

16:27.946 --> 16:29.782
NO, NO, UH...

16:29.948 --> 16:32.242
WE'RE FIGURING ON GOING OUT
FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING,

16:32.409 --> 16:33.952
EARLY.

16:34.119 --> 16:35.120
WELL, I'LL GIVE
THE BOY A HAND.

16:35.287 --> 16:37.122
THAT'D BE GOOD.

16:46.465 --> 16:47.925
GIDDY-UP!

16:48.967 --> 16:50.052
WHOA!

16:50.219 --> 16:53.305
HEY, YOU'RE HOME
NICE AND EARLY, ISAIAH.

16:53.472 --> 16:54.848
FINISH YOUR HOMEWORK?

16:55.015 --> 16:56.558
NO, SIR.

16:56.725 --> 16:59.144
GET TO IT. TOLD YOU I WANTED TO GET
STARTED FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.605
BUT I THOUGHT
THAT YOU WERE--

17:01.772 --> 17:04.024
NEVER MIND WHAT YOU THOUGHT.
JUST GET STARTED.

17:05.651 --> 17:07.945
[WHISPERING]
Go on.

17:16.662 --> 17:17.996
ISAIAH.

17:18.163 --> 17:20.332
HEARD ALL I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.
THE MATTER'S CLOSED.

17:20.499 --> 17:21.625
BUT THIS MORNING--

17:21.792 --> 17:22.918
IF I'M GOING TO BE A
FATHER TO THAT BOY,

17:23.085 --> 17:24.336
HE'S GONNA HAVE
TO BE A SON TO ME.

17:24.503 --> 17:25.713
NOW, HE'S GOING HUNTING
WITH ME TOMORROW.

17:25.879 --> 17:26.964
LET ME
FINISH THE WORK.

17:27.131 --> 17:28.716
GIDDY-UP.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.071
COME ON, JACK.

17:59.288 --> 18:01.373
THAT OLD COW WAS
MIGHTY GENEROUS THIS MORNING.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.959
MORE MILK HERE THAN
WE COULD DRINK IN A WEEK.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.712
HATE TO SEE ALL THAT
GOOD MILK GO TO WASTE.

18:06.879 --> 18:09.715
JUST WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
ELSE WE COULD DO WITH IT.

18:09.882 --> 18:12.384
GEE, PA,
I DON'T KNOW.

18:12.551 --> 18:15.554
WHAT COULD WE DO WITH A
LOT OF EXTRA MILK, MARY?

18:15.721 --> 18:17.723
LET ME THINK.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.976
WHY DON'T YOU ALL JUST SAY
YOU'D LIKE SOME ICE CREAM?

18:21.143 --> 18:22.603
WE'D LIKE
SOME ICE CREAM.

18:22.770 --> 18:24.229
Caroline: WELL,
WE'LL NEED SOME ICE.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.315
NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE.
I'LL HITCH UP THE TEAM.

18:26.482 --> 18:28.567
Mary: PA, CAN YOU GIVE ME A
RIDE BY THE SANDERSONS'?

18:28.734 --> 18:30.235
JOHN'S GOING TO HELP
ME WITH MY ESSAY.

18:30.402 --> 18:31.403
WELL, JOHN'S NOT HOME
THIS WEEKEND, DARLING.

18:31.570 --> 18:32.780
HE WENT HUNTING
WITH MR. EDWARDS.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.865
HE SAID HE'D BE HOME
THE WHOLE WEEKEND.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.951
EITHER WAY, IT'S A NICE DAY FOR A RIDE.
COME ON.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.871
BE HOME EARLY SO YOU
CAN HELP WITH SUPPER.

18:41.038 --> 18:42.414
I WILL, MA.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.041
WHERE'S YOUR
GLASSES, MARY?

18:44.208 --> 18:45.250
I DON'T HAVE TO WEAR
THEM ALL THE TIME.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.002
DR. BURKE SAID SO.
BYE, MA.

18:47.169 --> 18:47.920
BYE-BYE.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.546
BE BACK
AS SOON AS I CAN.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.970
I KNOW WHY MARY DOESN'T
WANT TO WEAR HER GLASSES.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.430
Caroline: OH,
YOU Do, Do YOU?

18:58.597 --> 19:02.768
YUP. SHE WANTS JOHN TO SEE
HER BEAUTIFUL BLUE EYES.

19:02.935 --> 19:04.895
WELL, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT?

19:05.062 --> 19:06.939
NOTHING...

19:07.105 --> 19:10.025
IF YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL
BLUE EYES.

19:11.610 --> 19:12.986
HYAH!

19:15.280 --> 19:17.658
HYAH! HYAH!

19:17.825 --> 19:18.742
Grace: MORNING, CHARLES.

19:18.909 --> 19:20.118
MORNING.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.538
GOOD MORNING, MRS. EDWARDS.
IS JOHN IN THE HOUSE?

19:22.704 --> 19:25.582
NO, MARY. HE'S OFF FOR THE
WEEKEND WITH MR. EDWARDS.

19:25.749 --> 19:26.959
NOW, SEE?
WHAT'D I TELL YOU?

19:27.125 --> 19:28.794
Mary: BUT HE SAID
HE DIDN'T HAVE To Go.

19:28.961 --> 19:31.088
UH, MARY,

19:31.255 --> 19:33.090
I'VE GOT A PITCHER
OF LEMONADE IN THE HOUSE.

19:33.257 --> 19:34.341
WHY DON'T YOU GO IN
AND HAVE SOME?

19:34.508 --> 19:35.384
YEAH. CAN I, PA?

19:35.551 --> 19:36.301
SURE, YOU CAN.

19:36.468 --> 19:37.719
CAN ALICIA
HAVE SOME WITH ME?

19:37.886 --> 19:38.762
OH, CERTAINLY.

19:38.929 --> 19:39.805
COME ON.

19:39.972 --> 19:41.473
DON'T LET HER
GET INTO THE SUGAR.

19:41.640 --> 19:45.394
Mary: I WON'T.
COME ON.

19:45.561 --> 19:49.815
I TRIED TO TELL HER
JOHN WOULDN'T BE HERE.

19:49.982 --> 19:52.568
CHARLES, I WANTED TO HAVE A
CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU ALONE.

19:52.734 --> 19:54.611
SOMETHING WRONG?

19:54.778 --> 19:57.322
I WISH I KNEW.
IT'S ISAIAH.

19:57.489 --> 19:58.991
HE'S NOT
FEELING POORLY?

19:59.157 --> 20:03.620
OH, NO. IF IT WAS ANYTHING LIKE
THAT, I'D KNOW WHAT TO DO.

20:03.787 --> 20:04.663
IT'S THE RIFLE.

20:04.830 --> 20:07.499
THE NEW ONE
HE BOUGHT FOR JOHN?

20:07.666 --> 20:08.500
YES.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.295
JOHN'S NOT LIKE MOST BOYS,

20:11.461 --> 20:13.964
AT LEAST NOT WHEN
IT COMES TO HUNTING.

20:14.131 --> 20:15.799
HE JUST COULDN'T
KILL ANYTHING,

20:15.966 --> 20:18.552
NOT EVEN FOR FOOD.
HE JUST COULDN'T DO IT.

20:18.719 --> 20:21.096
AND NOW I SAIAH'S MADE HIM
GO OFF ON THIS TRIP.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.724
WHY DIDN'T JOHN JUST
EXPLAIN IT TO HIM?

20:23.891 --> 20:26.310
HE TRIED.
I TRIED YESTERDAY.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.687
I THOUGHT
HE UNDERSTOOD, BUT...

20:28.854 --> 20:32.649
I GUESS HE'S JUST SO HURT ABOUT
THE BOY NOT WANTING THE RIFLE.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.653
THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE ISAIAH.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.238
EVEN SO,
HE'LL GET OVER IT.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.281
I HOPE SO.

20:39.448 --> 20:40.616
SURE, HE WILL.
YOU'D BE SURPRISED

20:40.782 --> 20:41.950
WHAT A FATHER AND SON
CAN GET ACCOMPLISHED

20:42.117 --> 20:43.619
ON A WEEKEND
TOGETHER.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.204
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.373
I'M PROBABLY
MAKING TOO MUCH OF IT.

20:48.540 --> 20:49.750
IT'S SILLY, I GUESS.

20:49.917 --> 20:53.211
YOU LOVE 'EM BOTH. NOTHING
SILLY ABOUT THAT.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.506
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.300
HOW ABOUT SOME LEMONADE
BEFORE YOU GO?

20:58.467 --> 20:59.760
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

21:55.273 --> 21:57.317
Isaiah: COME AND GET IT!

22:14.459 --> 22:16.378
THERE YOU GO. PUT SOME
OF THEM ON YOUR INSIDE,

22:16.545 --> 22:18.463
THEN WE'LL
GET STARTED.

22:30.225 --> 22:32.352
HERE.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.645
WHAT'S THAT?

22:34.896 --> 22:36.773
I HAD SOME
THINGS TO TELL YOU,

22:36.940 --> 22:38.233
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY THEM.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.986
IT'S EASIER FOR ME TO
WRITE THE WAY I FEEL.

22:42.946 --> 22:45.282
WELL, UM, I'LL READ IT
LATER ON WHEN, UH--

22:45.449 --> 22:46.700
PLEASE READ IT NOW.

22:46.867 --> 22:50.662
IT'S ABOUT THE HUNTING.
PART OF IT IS, ANYWAY.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.918
ALL RIGHT.

23:14.436 --> 23:18.148
ALL RIGHT, I READ IT. NOW LET'S FINISH
UP SO WE CAN GET STARTED HUNTING.

24:47.195 --> 24:48.530
HOLD IT.

24:54.286 --> 24:57.247
[RUSTLING]

24:57.414 --> 24:59.708
NOW BE CAREFUL.

25:32.532 --> 25:35.285
[CLICK]

25:46.630 --> 25:48.340
AAH!

25:48.506 --> 25:50.675
AAH! AAH!

25:51.593 --> 25:52.427
SHOOT HIM!

25:52.594 --> 25:54.387
AAH AAH!

25:54.554 --> 25:56.848
AAH! SHOOT HIM!

25:57.015 --> 25:58.600
AAH!

25:58.767 --> 26:00.518
AAH!

26:01.937 --> 26:03.021
AAH!

26:37.806 --> 26:40.517
GET HELP.

26:40.684 --> 26:42.269
I NEED HELP.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.707
IT'LL BE A WHILE
BEFORE WE KNOW.

27:45.874 --> 27:48.209
HE'S LOST
A LOT OF BLOOD.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.671
IF IT WERE
ANYONE ELSE,

27:51.838 --> 27:54.215
I'D SAY THERE
WAS NO CHANCE.

27:55.383 --> 27:58.636
BUT THAT MAN'S
AS STRONG AS THEY COME.

28:00.638 --> 28:02.724
WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO WAIT.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.825
SOME COFFEE, DOCTOR?

28:21.743 --> 28:23.328
THANK YOU.

28:47.519 --> 28:49.854
HE'S STRONG. HE'S
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

28:51.856 --> 28:53.691
IT'S MY FAULT.

28:54.818 --> 28:57.070
COME ON. WHAT KIND OF
THING IS THAT TO SAY?

28:57.237 --> 28:59.531
IT'S THE TRUTH.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.577
I JUST STOOD THERE
AND WATCHED.

29:09.499 --> 29:12.669
MR. INGALLS,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?
