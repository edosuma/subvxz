00:44.099 --> 00:45.099
I don't want to know.

00:45.599 --> 00:47.890
There's chicken pot pie
defrosting on the counter.

00:47.902 --> 00:49.799
Dad is not home and
I'm going to therapy.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.503
First stop of the day.
Just you and me, kid.

02:02.303 --> 02:04.403
Just... pick a seat...

02:05.504 --> 02:07.004
Any seat.

02:11.504 --> 02:12.904
It's my first day
of high school.

02:13.904 --> 02:17.804
I have seven new notebooks, a
skirt I hate and a stomachache.

02:36.305 --> 02:38.705
Hi I'm Heather. I'm new here.

02:39.105 --> 02:41.306
Are you? We moved
in here Saturday.

02:44.906 --> 02:45.669
Cool shoes.

02:45.681 --> 02:48.006
Oh, thanks.
I got them at a back to school sale.

02:48.506 --> 02:50.606
I mean, I wanted them in
black but I wear an 8 1/2.

02:51.106 --> 02:54.706
And they were a bit small, so I had to
find 9s. They only had a 9 in pink.

02:55.906 --> 02:57.206
But they look good.

03:19.708 --> 03:20.708
Name.

03:21.808 --> 03:24.008
Name, freshman. It's
for the yearbook.

03:26.008 --> 03:27.808
Melinda Sordino.

03:32.608 --> 03:36.609
The school board decided that Trojans
didn't send a strong message of abstinence.

03:37.409 --> 03:40.309
So now we've become the
Merryweather Hornets.

03:49.509 --> 03:53.110
What are we supposed to cheer? 'We are
the Hornets, the horny horny Hornets!'?

04:17.111 --> 04:19.611
Got a hall pass, young lady?
Come here.

04:20.911 --> 04:21.911
Hustle, young lady!

04:27.911 --> 04:29.712
Seven minutes past grace period.

04:32.112 --> 04:33.112
Name.

04:34.412 --> 04:36.612
Don't make this difficult. Name!

04:38.612 --> 04:40.612
Melinda Sordino.

04:41.112 --> 04:42.412
- Grade?
- Ninth.

04:48.513 --> 04:52.113
That's one demerit, Sordino.
Get to class.

04:57.713 --> 05:03.113
Biology... is the study of...

05:03.713 --> 05:06.014
Is the study of... good...

05:06.514 --> 05:08.514
Good.

05:09.314 --> 05:12.314
Oh hello, dear. Do you
have a late pass?

05:14.014 --> 05:18.014
It is the first day. Just
don't make it a habit of it.

05:18.114 --> 05:21.414
- And your name is?
- Melinda Sordino.

05:23.315 --> 05:28.115
Ok, your lab partner must be...
uh, let's see...

05:31.715 --> 05:34.015
Oh, excellent!
And your name is?

05:35.015 --> 05:36.515
Dave Petrakis.

05:41.816 --> 05:44.216
My English teacher has no face.

05:49.716 --> 05:51.716
I call her "Hair Woman".

05:57.016 --> 06:01.317
Grada Walkancros...
from Belgium.

06:02.317 --> 06:05.817
We're so pleased to have
you here in America.

06:06.817 --> 06:08.317
She doesn't speak English.

06:14.717 --> 06:16.718
- Heather Billings.
- Here.

06:19.518 --> 06:21.118
Rachel Bruin.

06:21.618 --> 06:25.618
Rochelle. Ah, Rochelle.
Rochelle.

06:26.918 --> 06:29.518
Rachel Bruin. My ex-best friend.

06:59.220 --> 07:02.631
Oh, and class?
Please tell me if I

07:02.655 --> 07:07.620
pronounce your surname wrong or
if you have a preferred nickname.

09:05.827 --> 09:08.027
911, what is the nature
of your emergency?

09:09.827 --> 09:12.627
Hello? Hold the line, we'll
try to find your location.

09:15.528 --> 09:17.528
- Rachel, wait...
- Are you nuts?

09:26.328 --> 09:28.028
Where's Melinda?
I don't care!

09:31.328 --> 09:33.429
Hi everybody. Uh,
welcome to Art.

09:33.929 --> 09:36.729
The only class that will
teach you how to survive.

09:37.829 --> 09:40.129
This is where you
can find your soul.

09:41.429 --> 09:43.429
If you dare.

09:44.129 --> 09:46.329
Don't ask me to show you
how to draw a face.

09:48.029 --> 09:51.830
Ask me to help you
find the wind.

09:53.030 --> 09:56.030
Good! Right, that's good! Can you
tell me what you're feeling?

09:56.730 --> 09:57.830
Right now.

10:02.030 --> 10:06.230
Ok, can anybody tell me what they're
actually feeling right now?

10:09.031 --> 10:11.531
Does Algebra move you to tears?

10:13.631 --> 10:18.431
Are numbers and words more
important than images?

10:21.131 --> 10:23.031
Can anybody tell
me what this is?

10:23.831 --> 10:26.532
A-globe?
A-globe.

10:28.232 --> 10:32.532
What are you guys 13, 14? You've already
let them beat the creativity out of you?

10:33.932 --> 10:35.432
It's ok.

10:36.132 --> 10:39.322
I used to let my daughters
kick this around my

10:39.334 --> 10:42.332
studio when it was too
wet to play outside.

10:42.932 --> 10:47.433
And one day, Jennie put her
foot right through Texas and

10:48.033 --> 10:51.433
the entire United States,
crumbled into the sea. See?

10:53.233 --> 11:00.533
I mean, you could, you could, ahem, paint
a wet muzzled dog chewing Alaska, right?

11:04.634 --> 11:06.834
I mean, the possibilities
are endless.

11:09.134 --> 11:14.834
It's almost too much, but uh, you all
are important enough to give it to. So.

11:17.634 --> 11:21.935
Alright, so um, here you go.
In here is a piece of paper.

11:22.835 --> 11:26.135
Great. And on that piece
of paper is a word.

11:26.735 --> 11:31.935
You're gonna spend the rest of the
year turning that object into art.

11:38.536 --> 11:40.036
- Mr. Freeman.
- Mm-hmm?

11:40.536 --> 11:43.001
When I was little, I was
really scared of clowns and I

11:43.013 --> 11:45.536
don't want to relapse and
have to go back into therapy.

11:46.636 --> 11:50.036
Oh, yeah well fear is a
great place to begin art.

12:00.437 --> 12:04.337
Hey! Whoa! You just chose your destiny.
You can't change that.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.937
I learned how to draw a tree
in like the second grade.

12:13.438 --> 12:15.138
Oh, really?

12:16.538 --> 12:20.838
Well, you gonna show me?
It's ok, I won't grade you.

12:33.839 --> 12:37.039
No commentary, please.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.240
That's a pretty good start.

12:57.940 --> 13:00.180
Let's see what it looks like
at the end of the year, huh?

13:21.341 --> 13:23.141
It's Melinda Sordino.

13:25.443 --> 13:29.843
Called the cops. You know,
and busted everyone...

13:31.144 --> 13:35.044
You know, my buddy? You
know Jeff, his brother?

13:44.943 --> 13:46.743
See you tomorrow!

14:14.544 --> 14:16.744
Are you sick?

14:17.845 --> 14:19.845
How was your first day?

14:21.245 --> 14:23.445
- Fine.
- Look what I got at the store.

14:24.945 --> 14:26.945
You don't like it, we can
always get store credit.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.147
Where's the sweater?

14:58.847 --> 15:00.847
I thought you said
it was returnable.

15:01.547 --> 15:05.547
No, I got it on sale. Don't wear
it, don't wear it. It's fine.

15:06.147 --> 15:07.847
Well then why'd you
say that it...

15:23.548 --> 15:27.348
All that crap you hear on TV about
communication and expressing feelings

15:27.848 --> 15:28.848
is a lie.

15:29.149 --> 15:30.949
No one really cares
what you have to say.

15:31.049 --> 15:34.249
So here's the plan. We join 5 clubs,
one for every day of the week.

15:34.449 --> 15:36.949
But not like Latin club.
Cool stuff.

15:37.249 --> 15:40.149
What do you want to join? Hey, maybe we
can tutor kids at the elementary school.

15:40.249 --> 15:44.149
What about your friends from last year?
Don't you know Nicole?

15:44.549 --> 15:46.650
I wonder how long it would
take for anyone to notice

15:47.150 --> 15:50.350
if I just stopped talking.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.850
0% body fat!

15:52.250 --> 15:55.050
I was into bowling back in La Joya.
That was fun.

15:56.250 --> 16:00.150
But the bowling club here does seem like
it really attracts the right people.

16:02.050 --> 16:04.047
Hanging back is a very
common mistake most ninth

16:04.059 --> 16:06.151
graders make.
I mean you shouldn't be intimidated.

16:07.451 --> 16:10.351
Wait, are you getting darker than me?
Hold on.

16:27.952 --> 16:32.252
- Oh man. You need a mouth guard.
- Gym should be illegal.

16:33.052 --> 16:34.552
It's humiliating.

16:35.552 --> 16:37.580
Hey, do you know the Martha clan?
They do all these

16:37.592 --> 16:39.592
cool projects like feeding
the homeless and stuff.

16:39.952 --> 16:41.964
Oh and they dress in different
color schemes depending

16:41.976 --> 16:43.937
on the season.
I mean, I'm not good in fall tones.

16:43.953 --> 16:46.313
And I said I can wear beige
instead of orange, but you know.

16:51.053 --> 16:54.053
Oh no, Sordino. Front row.

16:56.353 --> 16:58.554
I got my eye on you.

17:05.754 --> 17:09.454
We're studying American history
for the ninth time in nine years.

17:10.654 --> 17:14.180
Every year they say we're going
to get right up to the present

17:14.204 --> 17:16.284
but we always get stuck in
the industrial revolution.

17:17.355 --> 17:19.055
My family...

17:19.755 --> 17:21.955
has been in this country...

17:22.355 --> 17:24.055
for over 200 years.

17:25.955 --> 17:27.655
We built this place.

17:28.155 --> 17:30.955
We fought in every war. From
the first one to the last one.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.756
We paid our taxes. They voted.

17:36.056 --> 17:41.056
So, tell me why my
son can't get a job.

17:45.756 --> 17:48.556
Reverse discrimination.

17:49.456 --> 17:51.857
He wanted to be a firefighter.

17:53.157 --> 17:56.057
Went up for the job

17:56.457 --> 17:57.457
but he didn't get it.

17:59.957 --> 18:03.657
What I'm suggesting here is maybe
if we had closed our borders

18:04.057 --> 18:08.957
in 1900, then real Americans
would get the jobs they deserve.

18:15.058 --> 18:16.258
Young lady.

18:16.958 --> 18:19.250
Um, I think that we're all
foreigners, and should

18:19.262 --> 18:21.658
just give the country back
to the Native Americans.

18:24.958 --> 18:27.559
Now we have a debate, don't we?

18:29.359 --> 18:32.759
Native Americans.

18:34.059 --> 18:35.959
Maybe your son didn't get the job
because he wasn't good enough.

18:36.359 --> 18:38.692
Or maybe he's lazy... or maybe
the guy was just better...

18:38.704 --> 18:39.799
Watch your mouth, mister.

18:40.959 --> 18:42.459
That's my son you're
talking about.

18:43.159 --> 18:45.360
You know what? That's
enough debate.

18:45.860 --> 18:47.360
Everybody take out your book.

18:54.260 --> 18:56.360
Mr. Petrakis, please
take your seat.

18:57.460 --> 19:00.060
If the class is debating, than any student
has a right to say what's on his mind.

19:00.660 --> 19:03.261
I decide who talks in here, Mr.
Petrakis.

19:04.861 --> 19:07.901
You opened a debate. You can't close it
just because it's not going your way.

19:08.661 --> 19:10.329
Watch me! Take your seat, Mr.
Petrakis.

19:10.341 --> 19:12.261
The constitution does
not recognize different

19:12.361 --> 19:15.361
levels of citizenship based upon
the time spent in the country.

19:15.961 --> 19:18.361
As a citizen and a student, I'm
protesting the tone of this lesson

19:18.461 --> 19:20.962
as racist, intolerant,
and xenophobic.

19:21.462 --> 19:25.062
Sit your butt in that chair, Mr. Petrakis.
And watch your mouth.

19:26.262 --> 19:30.662
I tried to get this debate going and, uh,
you people turn it into a race thing.

19:31.762 --> 19:34.682
Sit down, Mr. Petrakis, or you're gonna
go down to the principal's office.

19:47.263 --> 19:50.063
Dave Petrakis is my new hero.

20:01.464 --> 20:03.864
Hey, Rach.

20:07.064 --> 20:08.264
How's it going?

20:09.064 --> 20:10.064
Good.

20:12.064 --> 20:14.164
I know.

20:16.965 --> 20:17.965
Look...

20:18.765 --> 20:20.465
I was wondering if we could...

20:26.465 --> 20:28.465
Boni Va Cheri.

20:39.266 --> 20:43.766
"Exchange students are
ruining our country."

20:51.867 --> 20:53.667
- Sordino.
- Yo, fresh meat.

20:55.267 --> 20:57.167
- What?
- Can't I say hello?

21:23.668 --> 21:26.069
I'm sorry, it's just you
can't be standing here.

21:26.669 --> 21:27.669
Alone.

21:28.869 --> 21:30.269
You're just too pretty.

21:32.869 --> 21:35.769
I'm not alone.
My friends are inside.

21:39.269 --> 21:42.369
Well... would you like
to go dance with me?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.270
Sure.

23:25.175 --> 23:27.375
There is no point talking
to my ex-friends.

23:27.875 --> 23:30.675
Our clan "The Plain Janes" has
been absorbed by rival groups.

23:32.376 --> 23:35.176
Nicole hangs out with the jocks.
Rachel went all "Euro".

23:36.576 --> 23:39.476
Ivy straddles two crowds...
The Goths and "The Marthas".

23:41.276 --> 23:42.876
And then there's me...

23:44.876 --> 23:46.976
I'm clanless.

24:09.278 --> 24:11.378
Nice, Petrakis.
Look live, Missy.

24:13.578 --> 24:15.747
It's impossible to listen to Miss Kane.
Her voice

24:15.759 --> 24:17.678
sounds like an engine
that won't turn over.

24:19.178 --> 24:21.327
- Plus she laughs at her own jokes.
- Alright, we're

24:21.339 --> 24:23.378
beginning our unit on
genetics and reproduction.

24:24.379 --> 24:27.979
In case you thought your
genes came from JC Penny...

24:29.879 --> 24:32.379
Ah, oh no, these genes
are actually different.

24:32.879 --> 24:35.490
Now you'll want to cut
your apples into four...

24:35.502 --> 24:38.179
boys, I'm going to take
points off your grade...

24:54.380 --> 24:56.380
What are you doing?
We need that.

25:33.482 --> 25:35.983
- Heather has found a
- clan: "The Marthas".

25:36.583 --> 25:38.783
Very Connecticut, very prep.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.483
I suspect money changed hands.

25:47.983 --> 25:49.783
I like your costume.

25:52.583 --> 25:55.184
So, what are you guys?

25:55.484 --> 25:59.084
- Ever heard of the 1920s?
- We're flappers at a speakeasy.

25:59.984 --> 26:01.784
Andy Evans. 8 o'clock.

26:04.384 --> 26:07.484
'Em, I think he's looking for you.
Fact, he called her last night.

26:07.884 --> 26:10.984
Fact, he's gorgeous. Hey, could
you grab me an iced tea?

26:15.185 --> 26:17.685
- Hello, ladies.
- Hey, what's up?

26:18.885 --> 26:21.285
- Did you bring me a taco?
- Of course.

26:21.385 --> 26:22.385
Just kidding.

26:22.485 --> 26:24.085
No, take it.

26:29.386 --> 26:32.786
- What is that?
- Just kidding.

26:34.886 --> 26:38.586
- Did you bring my barrette?
- Ah, you know, I forgot it.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.087
Maybe you should wear
it to the house.

26:44.286 --> 26:46.386
- I think that looks really sexy on you.
- Thank you.

26:46.486 --> 26:49.687
What time do your parents
come home tonight? Around 6.

27:01.087 --> 27:05.188
- What's with her?
- She's a freak who needs chapstick.

27:05.288 --> 27:06.488
And a life.

27:07.688 --> 27:10.488
- I don't want her eating with us anymore.
- Nice, Siobhan.

27:10.588 --> 27:12.188
What, we're not social workers.

27:12.988 --> 27:15.688
- The girl has problems.
- Yeah, who doesn't?

27:29.989 --> 27:32.089
Hey, you're the tree.

27:33.489 --> 27:36.489
You can eat lunch in here, if you want.
It is against school rules, but

27:36.589 --> 27:37.889
I'm kind of a rebel, so...

27:51.990 --> 27:53.290
Here you go.

27:58.490 --> 28:03.131
That's not a place mat.
Ok, the rule is that if

28:03.143 --> 28:08.291
you're gonna be in here,
you got to be working. So.

28:11.291 --> 28:14.891
Choose your weapon.
Do something, anything.

28:17.092 --> 28:19.592
Hey, does this inspire you?

28:20.292 --> 28:21.292
No?

28:41.093 --> 28:43.393
So you going
trick-or-treating tonight?

28:45.493 --> 28:46.493
No.

28:49.093 --> 28:51.193
Ah, you don't like candy?

28:53.694 --> 28:56.394
- I'm too old.
- Oh, right.

28:59.594 --> 29:02.394
Yeah, I got kids, so...

29:03.094 --> 29:04.894
Guess I never get
too old, right?

29:21.095 --> 29:24.995
- Last year we were witches.
- Who's "we"?

29:29.496 --> 29:31.996
My ex-best friends.

29:48.197 --> 29:50.897
What are you doing? No.

29:51.897 --> 29:54.097
You gotta give things a chance.

30:10.998 --> 30:12.598
Close your eyes.

30:13.998 --> 30:16.398
Just do it. I'm the teacher.

30:23.399 --> 30:26.999
Can you picture a tree?
Any tree.

30:34.199 --> 30:36.099
There it is.

30:36.999 --> 30:38.799
It's burned in your retina.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.600
You got it.

30:46.100 --> 30:47.200
Do it.

31:24.402 --> 31:26.802
Dave Petrakis invited me
over to do lab homework.

31:27.602 --> 31:29.402
I said no.

31:29.702 --> 31:31.402
No, thanks. I just... I can't.

31:47.803 --> 31:48.903
Oh, my God.

31:49.603 --> 31:51.504
I'm turning into "Hair Woman".

32:03.504 --> 32:07.004
Oh, damn!
The Turkey.

32:18.405 --> 32:20.405
- Maybe we should just get pizza.
- No.

32:20.805 --> 32:21.905
It's Thanksgiving.

32:24.705 --> 32:26.506
It just needs to thaw.

32:36.706 --> 32:37.706
How's she doing?

32:43.706 --> 32:45.007
It's Thanksgiving.

32:50.007 --> 32:51.807
Hey, you wanna go for doughnuts?

33:09.108 --> 33:10.308
How's school?

33:13.408 --> 33:14.808
Fine.

33:25.609 --> 33:27.109
You're boiling it?

33:27.509 --> 33:29.209
It's too big to put
in the microwave.

33:46.410 --> 33:47.910
He doesn't think
it's gonna thaw.

33:48.310 --> 33:49.810
No!
Not you, Ted.

33:59.811 --> 34:03.364
We can wash it. -Tell Julie
to restock the faux bells

34:03.376 --> 34:06.611
and to take the sign out
of the window, alright?

34:07.411 --> 34:09.949
No, they're in a green
box by the register...

34:09.961 --> 34:10.961
Sorry.

34:12.711 --> 34:14.512
Mel, see if there's any
potatoes over there.

34:18.612 --> 34:21.012
Can we just forget it?

34:21.712 --> 34:25.712
You know, I've got a
crisis down at the store.

34:26.512 --> 34:28.412
We'll go out to dinner, ok?

34:29.212 --> 34:32.313
My treat.

35:03.614 --> 35:05.514
Hey, Dan, good stuff.

35:07.315 --> 35:12.615
Yes, you are on fire, Melinda!
Yes! You are the bird.

35:13.315 --> 35:17.341
Hey, sacrifice yourself
to abandon family values

35:17.365 --> 35:19.315
and canned yams.
This is wonderful!

35:20.715 --> 35:22.415
But keep thinking tree.

35:25.616 --> 35:26.696
You know what I'm thinking?

35:27.216 --> 35:28.516
More glue.

35:30.516 --> 35:33.416
F minus. Just kidding.

35:44.917 --> 35:46.517
Where's the tree?

35:48.217 --> 35:49.817
It's firewood.

35:50.217 --> 35:51.417
Get it?

35:52.117 --> 35:53.717
You can do better than that.

36:26.419 --> 36:30.519
It's scary! Like in a weird way.
Not clown-scary.

36:31.819 --> 36:33.619
How do I say this?

36:34.519 --> 36:36.720
It's like you don't want to
look at it for too long.

36:40.620 --> 36:42.220
Excellent.

36:43.220 --> 36:44.620
This is excellent.

36:47.220 --> 36:48.820
What does this say to you?

36:52.620 --> 36:54.321
Do you want me to
tell you what I see?

36:56.321 --> 36:57.321
Alright.

36:59.121 --> 37:04.421
I see a girl caught in the
remains of a holiday gone bad.

37:07.421 --> 37:11.121
Her flesh, picked
off, day after day.

37:12.922 --> 37:16.154
The palm tree, might be
like a broken dream.

37:16.166 --> 37:19.122
I don't know, it
definitely has meaning.

37:20.722 --> 37:22.122
A lot of pain.

37:23.122 --> 37:24.122
That's good.

37:25.222 --> 37:26.722
Good job, Mel.

37:31.523 --> 37:34.423
There is no kissing
in the hallway.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.943
Hey, come to the pep rally with me.
I brought extra pompoms. Come on!

37:57.424 --> 38:00.724
Hey! I know these guys.
They're on the newspaper.

38:03.824 --> 38:08.725
This is Melinda Sordino. She was very
nice to me when I first got here.

39:09.928 --> 39:12.128
- You're Melinda Sordino?
- Yeah.

39:13.828 --> 39:16.628
Aren't you the one who called
the cops at Carl Ryder's party?

39:18.829 --> 39:22.329
My brother was arrested at that party.
Got fired because of it.

40:18.832 --> 40:20.632
I cannot believe.

40:21.132 --> 40:22.132
What?

40:24.432 --> 40:27.432
- Never mind.
- What?

40:28.032 --> 40:30.433
- Never mind.
- What? You can't say 'never mind'!

40:34.233 --> 40:36.333
Let's go for a drive.

40:39.133 --> 40:40.633
Come on, let's go.

40:44.533 --> 40:46.534
Maybe I should tell my friends!

40:46.535 --> 40:48.935
Tell your friends
you're with me.

40:51.734 --> 40:53.334
- Alright?
- Yeah.

41:05.335 --> 41:06.835
You want to?

41:08.735 --> 41:10.535
Wanna what?

41:16.035 --> 41:19.535
Let me out. Let me
talk to my friends.

41:25.136 --> 41:26.436
No.

41:29.636 --> 41:32.336
Stop. No.

41:35.536 --> 41:37.236
No.

41:40.637 --> 41:41.937
No, no, no.

41:53.037 --> 41:55.437
No, it's alright. It's alright.

41:58.238 --> 42:00.738
It's alright. It's
over now, okay.

42:01.138 --> 42:02.438
Okay.

42:02.838 --> 42:09.238
The bogeyman is gone. He went right
out that way. It's okay. You ok now?

42:12.638 --> 42:14.238
No.

42:15.839 --> 42:17.439
Oh, honey.

42:19.139 --> 42:21.439
I know that it's been
a rough year for you.

42:22.139 --> 42:24.039
I do.

42:24.739 --> 42:27.539
I really thought you and Rachel
were gonna patch things up.

42:30.039 --> 42:33.540
You know, sometimes, people just...
suck.

42:34.840 --> 42:40.740
But now, you have got to pull yourself
up by the bootstraps and get on with it.

42:44.040 --> 42:48.440
You're not even going to remember
any of this in 5 years. I swear.

42:52.141 --> 42:55.841
Come on. I'll make it home early tonight.
Can rent a movie.

42:56.641 --> 42:57.841
Yeah?

43:13.942 --> 43:16.842
Today is career day.

43:27.443 --> 43:34.243
(Am I: A) A helper b) A doer
c) A planner d) A dreamer?

43:57.144 --> 44:00.606
Every word Hawthorne
wrote; Every comma, every

44:00.618 --> 44:03.945
paragraph break, these
were done on purpose.

44:04.945 --> 44:10.245
It is our job to try and figure out
what he's really trying to say.

44:10.845 --> 44:13.133
Why couldn't he just say
what he meant? Would

44:13.145 --> 44:15.145
they pin a Scarlet
letter on his chest?

44:15.645 --> 44:18.245
- As for straightforward...
- The house...

44:18.945 --> 44:23.046
with the chunks of
glass in its walls...

44:23.946 --> 44:25.846
Is a symbol of what?

44:29.846 --> 44:34.946
It would reflect, sparkle.

44:35.846 --> 44:37.546
Come on, people...

44:38.046 --> 44:41.347
The house symbolizes?

44:43.147 --> 44:44.147
Yes.

44:44.647 --> 44:47.147
How do you know it's
what he meant to say?

44:47.247 --> 44:49.567
I mean, you could just make all that up.
It's just a story.

44:50.547 --> 44:52.047
This is Hawthorne.

44:52.647 --> 44:57.648
One of America's greatest novelists.
And not that makes any difference...

44:58.848 --> 45:01.948
but I wrote my
dissertation on Hawthorne.

45:03.848 --> 45:06.448
Fine, but...

45:06.748 --> 45:08.504
I thought we were all
supposed to have opinions

45:08.516 --> 45:10.274
here. I mean, it's a good
story, especially...

45:10.298 --> 45:13.418
when Hester and that guy fall in love.
But I don't really believe in symbolism.

45:14.249 --> 45:16.349
I mean, you can just
make all that up.

45:23.349 --> 45:24.849
Alright, class.

45:25.549 --> 45:29.149
I want you all to write
a 500 word essay...

45:30.249 --> 45:31.349
on symbolism.

45:32.650 --> 45:33.650
And then...

45:34.350 --> 45:36.350
Poor "Hair Woman".

45:36.950 --> 45:38.150
Turn it in.

45:38.750 --> 45:42.850
I hope they send her to a conference or
something. I'm ready to help pay for a sub.

45:55.851 --> 45:57.551
I guess you all must
be bad students.

45:57.751 --> 46:02.651
Because, apparently, I gave away
too many A's last trimester.

46:05.251 --> 46:07.351
Has anybody in here
learned anything?

46:10.552 --> 46:15.352
They cut my budget in half because
art isn't important, see.

46:15.452 --> 46:18.352
And then I get reamed
for grade inflation?

46:29.253 --> 46:30.653
Sorry.

46:31.253 --> 46:32.353
Go back to work.

46:42.653 --> 46:43.954
Mr. Freeman.

47:00.054 --> 47:01.555
Ivy.

47:02.155 --> 47:03.755
Will you take her to
the nurse, please?

47:05.655 --> 47:07.455
Hold it up.

47:10.755 --> 47:12.555
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

47:16.455 --> 47:18.155
Ivy's being nice.

47:19.956 --> 47:21.556
Say something.

47:23.756 --> 47:25.856
My throat is dry.

47:26.356 --> 47:28.356
It hurts.

47:31.056 --> 47:33.856
This one is the one I think I'm gonna use.
It's like... Really, just like...

47:33.956 --> 47:36.857
Heather landed a modeling job at
a department store in the mall.

47:37.857 --> 47:39.757
It's paying off in
major "Martha" points.

47:40.557 --> 47:43.351
It is so disgusting, I don't know why.
And then like

47:43.363 --> 47:45.957
that one? It just was like,
what was I thinking?

47:48.457 --> 47:49.857
You want to start?

47:50.257 --> 47:55.558
Now remember, we're just taking a peek
inside today. Don't remove anything.

47:56.158 --> 47:58.458
It's very hard to put it back.

48:01.458 --> 48:03.158
Are you sure you want to do?

48:07.958 --> 48:09.258
Do you want me to do?

48:10.458 --> 48:11.658
No, um, I got it.

48:15.659 --> 48:18.459
It's one clean line down the middle.
Like a zipper.

48:32.860 --> 48:34.460
Melinda.

48:35.660 --> 48:36.760
Hello?

48:37.160 --> 48:42.060
Can you count backwards from 10? Who
is the President of the United States?

48:43.660 --> 48:44.960
Come on, open your eyes.

48:46.760 --> 48:49.261
Oh my gosh. Dave, don't hit her!

48:49.661 --> 48:51.661
It's what you're supposed to do.
My Dad's a doctor.

48:51.761 --> 48:52.761
Melinda.

48:54.561 --> 48:56.361
Who is the governor of Texas?

49:07.862 --> 49:09.762
It's beautiful.

49:10.762 --> 49:12.862
You can't go wrong
with the classic "V".

49:16.962 --> 49:19.662
Wow, this is great! You shouldn't
have spent so much money though.

49:19.762 --> 49:21.762
It's ok, I wanted to.

49:22.062 --> 49:25.063
That way you won't bleed all
over the bathroom floor, honey.

49:26.963 --> 49:30.763
And these are for you.
Open the big one first.

49:37.863 --> 49:42.064
It's for your room. It'll
help you fall asleep.

49:53.464 --> 49:55.464
Oh, we noticed you
were drawing, so...

49:55.465 --> 49:57.465
I hope we got the right kind.

50:12.965 --> 50:15.565
You know this thing
has a sleep alarm.

50:18.066 --> 50:20.878
I don't know what quadra surf means?
What do you think

50:20.890 --> 50:23.466
it is?
I think it means you surf multiple quads.

50:24.666 --> 50:26.566
Headphone Jack.

50:26.966 --> 50:29.266
Front and rear a/v Jacks.

50:29.866 --> 50:32.866
Is it 19 inches across or high?

50:32.867 --> 50:34.467
It's 19 all the way around.

51:25.169 --> 51:26.469
I hate winter.

51:26.869 --> 51:29.570
I've lived in the Midwest my
whole life and I hate winter.

51:30.970 --> 51:32.870
It starts too early
and it ends too late.

51:34.370 --> 51:36.470
Why doesn't everyone
just move to Florida?

51:54.871 --> 51:56.671
Attention Merry
Weather students:

51:57.071 --> 52:01.471
- The final tally is in.
- Bees: 35, Icebergs: 17.

52:01.671 --> 52:06.672
Hilltoppers: 6, Wombats: 84.

52:07.272 --> 52:10.672
We will now be the home of:
"The Merry Weather Wombats."

52:11.672 --> 52:13.398
What in the world is a Wombat?

52:13.422 --> 52:15.882
For those of you who
didn't vote, maybe you've

52:15.894 --> 52:18.472
learned a valuable lesson
today about democracy.

52:21.972 --> 52:23.373
Oh hey, Melinda.

52:24.373 --> 52:27.573
Can we have a heart to heart at lunch?
It's kind of important.

52:28.073 --> 52:29.973
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, great.

52:40.073 --> 52:41.774
This is really awkward.

52:42.274 --> 52:44.874
No matter what...

52:45.574 --> 52:46.734
Oh, I don't want to say that.

52:47.774 --> 52:50.674
I mean, we kind of paired up
at the beginning of school.

52:50.774 --> 52:52.254
When I was new and
didn't know anyone.

52:53.074 --> 52:54.714
And that was really,
really sweet of you.

52:56.074 --> 52:57.074
But...

52:57.574 --> 53:00.475
I think it's time that we
both admit to each other that

53:00.575 --> 53:02.475
we're just very
different people.

53:03.975 --> 53:06.801
I mean, I have my modeling
and I like to shop.

53:06.825 --> 53:07.825
I like to shop.

53:09.675 --> 53:12.375
You don't like anything. You're the
most depressed person I've ever met.

53:12.475 --> 53:14.075
And excuse me for
saying this, but...

53:14.975 --> 53:16.976
I think you need
professional help.

53:23.976 --> 53:27.476
So, you're blowing me off
because I'm a little depressed?

53:28.176 --> 53:30.776
Once you get through
this 'life sucks' phase,

53:30.876 --> 53:32.916
I'm sure lots of people will
want to be your friend.

53:34.777 --> 53:38.577
But for right now, I don't think
we should have lunch together.

53:47.077 --> 53:49.677
Look, I need to be alone. And I'm
glad you're so enthusiastic, but...

53:49.777 --> 53:50.877
I just need some space.

53:57.978 --> 54:01.578
- Rise and shine, Melinda.
- Your report card came this morning.

54:02.178 --> 54:04.658
I'm only going to say this once.
You gotta get those grades up.

54:04.878 --> 54:06.878
- Way up.
- I'll handle this, alright?

54:07.678 --> 54:10.679
Honey, we just want you to do
your best, and we know that

54:10.779 --> 54:12.579
your best is a lot
better than this, okay?

54:13.079 --> 54:16.779
What happened with social studies?
This Mr. Neck gave you a "D".

54:17.379 --> 54:20.879
We want you to ask Neck how
you can raise your grade.

54:21.679 --> 54:24.479
This is not gonna look good on
your college application, sweetie.

54:24.979 --> 54:27.680
- I had to go to state.
- She knows.

54:28.680 --> 54:31.280
You'll go today,
won't you, honey?

54:59.281 --> 55:00.581
Excuse me, sir.

55:01.881 --> 55:04.382
I was wondering if...

55:06.482 --> 55:09.182
I was... Come on,
Sordino, spit it out.

55:10.482 --> 55:13.082
You have to learn to enunciate,
or else no one will listen.

55:14.782 --> 55:18.582
I was wondering if there was any
way I could raise my grade?

55:20.282 --> 55:22.083
Parents got the
report card, huh?

55:23.583 --> 55:27.083
No, I just wanted to.

55:27.583 --> 55:28.903
Why I should give
you that chance?

55:31.283 --> 55:34.083
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

55:35.783 --> 55:37.383
I mean, isn't that
what Jesus said?

55:39.884 --> 55:41.884
Are you being smart with me?

55:44.184 --> 55:47.041
Ok, I'm feeling generous,
just because I don't

55:47.053 --> 55:49.984
want to have to see your
face in summer school.

55:51.284 --> 55:55.484
Write me a report on a cultural
influence at the turn of the century.

55:58.285 --> 56:00.085
And it better be good.

56:03.885 --> 56:05.585
It will be.

56:08.985 --> 56:10.785
I'll write about
the Suffragettes.

56:11.585 --> 56:15.086
Before they came along, women
were treated like dogs.

56:49.187 --> 56:53.188
To get credit, you have
to deliver it orally.

56:54.088 --> 56:56.888
Tomorrow, at the
beginning of class.

57:19.289 --> 57:22.589
- Can you help me with something?
- Yeah, sure. What's up?

57:33.990 --> 57:36.290
Sordino?

57:41.590 --> 57:42.328
Mr. Patrucus.

57:42.340 --> 57:44.591
The Suffragettes fought
for their right to speak.

57:45.391 --> 57:48.591
They were attacked, arrested and
thrown in jail for daring to do

57:48.691 --> 57:49.791
what they wanted to do.

57:50.891 --> 57:53.491
Like them, Melinda is willing to
stand up for what she believes.

57:53.591 --> 57:55.491
That no one should be
forced to give speeches.

57:56.291 --> 57:58.791
- What is this?
- Melinda had to deliver her report...

57:58.891 --> 58:01.811
to the class as part of the assignment.
She made copies everyone can read.

58:02.292 --> 58:03.292
Oh no you don't.

58:03.592 --> 58:07.292
When I say oral, I mean oral.
Now you, sit down!

58:08.392 --> 58:12.092
And you, read that report.
Open your mouth, Sordino.

58:12.592 --> 58:13.892
Open your damn mouth.

58:21.993 --> 58:25.293
I am so sick of your attitude.

58:29.793 --> 58:32.193
I forgot the Suffragettes
were hauled off to jail.

58:32.693 --> 58:34.093
Duh.

58:36.293 --> 58:37.293
Well...

58:40.094 --> 58:42.694
Oh, for the love of God,
open your mouth, Melinda.

58:43.494 --> 58:46.494
- This is childish, honey.
- I don't know why she's doing this to us.

58:47.194 --> 58:49.294
We're not ganging up on
you, we're here to help.

58:49.394 --> 58:51.194
Let's start with grades.

58:51.694 --> 58:53.482
This isn't what we
expect of you, Melissa.

58:53.494 --> 58:54.094
Melinda.

58:54.494 --> 58:56.054
Last year you were a
straight B student.

58:56.295 --> 58:59.095
No behavioral problems,
a few absences.

59:00.295 --> 59:01.595
What you have to say?

59:04.795 --> 59:07.495
She's mute. She's mute.
She's not saying anything.

59:09.195 --> 59:11.995
I think that we need to explore
the family dynamics at play.

59:12.395 --> 59:15.396
All I know is, last year I had a sweet,
loving little girl, and now she's

59:15.496 --> 59:17.396
flushing her grades
down the toilet.

59:18.096 --> 59:21.896
What have you folks done to her? I play
golf with the school board president.

59:21.996 --> 59:25.076
- Did you know that? Did you know that?
- Nobody cares who you play golf with.

59:25.196 --> 59:30.896
- Can I just remind everyone that
- we need to, number one: Reassure

59:31.597 --> 59:32.797
number two: Stay open,

59:33.897 --> 59:36.597
and number three: Don't judge.

59:37.197 --> 59:38.197
How old are you?

59:43.097 --> 59:44.097
Listen.

59:44.597 --> 59:48.397
The Suffragettes were all about speaking
up. You can't speak up for your rights

59:48.497 --> 59:49.497
and be silent.

59:51.598 --> 59:52.998
I thought what you
did was cool...

59:54.798 --> 59:56.898
but you can't make a difference
unless you speak up.

59:58.398 --> 1:00:00.038
Do you lecture all your
friends like this?

1:00:00.998 --> 1:00:02.998
Only the ones I like.

1:00:05.898 --> 1:00:07.299
Gotta go.

1:00:16.799 --> 1:00:19.299
Wow!
Melinda, you look pretty.

1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:43.401
"Thanks for understanding.
You the sweetest! Heather."

1:00:58.201 --> 1:01:01.602
Hi, class. Sorry I'm late.
I was... delayed.

1:01:05.902 --> 1:01:08.802
There was an accident and
I had to catch a ride.

1:01:14.302 --> 1:01:15.702
Andy.

1:01:29.703 --> 1:01:30.703
Good.

1:01:31.703 --> 1:01:32.703
That's nice.

1:01:56.305 --> 1:01:58.505
You need to visit the
mind of "The Great One".

1:02:02.705 --> 1:02:04.405
Picasso.

1:02:05.505 --> 1:02:06.705
Picasso.

1:02:07.305 --> 1:02:08.805
Who saw the truth.

1:02:10.805 --> 1:02:11.906
Who painted the truth.

1:02:13.706 --> 1:02:15.406
And ripped it from the earth...

1:02:17.106 --> 1:02:19.106
With two angry hands.

1:02:39.507 --> 1:02:40.807
Excuse me.

1:02:45.507 --> 1:02:47.408
It's "Night in Venice".

1:02:49.808 --> 1:02:53.008
This is the color of
an accountant's soul.

1:02:54.008 --> 1:02:59.708
A love rejected. This...
I once...

1:03:00.508 --> 1:03:04.808
grew mold on an orange this color
when I was living in Boston.

1:03:06.609 --> 1:03:07.609
And uh...

1:03:07.809 --> 1:03:11.209
These are various memories
of the school board.

1:03:14.609 --> 1:03:19.309
See uh, if something's eating at
you, you gotta find a way to use it.

1:03:52.111 --> 1:03:53.811
It's kind of dark in here.

1:04:02.512 --> 1:04:04.912
Have you seen Rochelle?

1:04:05.612 --> 1:04:08.312
Bruin?

1:04:09.712 --> 1:04:11.612
She was supposed to meet me.

1:04:16.112 --> 1:04:17.413
Hello?

1:04:19.013 --> 1:04:20.413
Anybody home?
Are you deaf?

1:04:29.613 --> 1:04:31.913
I was just thinking that...

1:04:34.013 --> 1:04:36.814
Andy, I've been looking for
you for like half an hour.

1:04:39.114 --> 1:04:39.552
Rochelle.

1:04:39.564 --> 1:04:40.914
I've been wandering up
and down the halls...

1:04:41.014 --> 1:04:42.489
I was just asking your
friend where you were.

1:04:42.501 --> 1:04:43.214
She's not my friend.

1:04:43.314 --> 1:04:44.914
- I thought she was your friend, alright?
- No, she's not.

1:04:45.514 --> 1:04:47.114
- Why were you asking her?
- I've been looking for you.

1:04:47.214 --> 1:04:48.914
Why didn't you wait...

1:04:49.114 --> 1:04:51.314
Just shut up, alright?

1:04:51.914 --> 1:04:54.215
I was looking for you, alright?

1:04:55.415 --> 1:04:57.315
- Andy.
- It is Valentine's Day. Okay?

1:05:34.317 --> 1:05:37.717
It's time for a mental health day.
So conjugate this:

1:05:38.217 --> 1:05:42.017
I cut class, you cut class,
he/she/it cuts class.

1:06:30.920 --> 1:06:34.520
I should probably tell someone.
Just anyone.

1:06:35.420 --> 1:06:36.720
Get it over with.

1:06:37.320 --> 1:06:38.420
Blurt it out.

1:08:15.426 --> 1:08:17.726
It's hard to sleep at home.

1:08:18.326 --> 1:08:21.526
How long would it take for the nurses
to figure out I don't belong here?

1:08:23.726 --> 1:08:25.926
Would they let me
rest for a few days?

1:09:42.431 --> 1:09:43.631
It happened.

1:09:44.131 --> 1:09:46.731
There's no avoiding it.
No forgetting.

1:10:34.534 --> 1:10:37.034
Mellie, there's a
friend here to see you.

1:10:42.834 --> 1:10:45.834
I hate being a "Martha". You
were so right not to join.

1:10:45.934 --> 1:10:47.534
I mean, all I am was
their little slave.

1:10:48.234 --> 1:10:51.635
Ok, it was supposed to be me and Megan
Shevan decorating the Holiday Inn for prom,

1:10:52.135 --> 1:10:54.835
and now Megan Shevan can't do it.
And I'm totally screwed.

1:10:55.935 --> 1:10:59.035
Mel, you have to help me. They have some
sales meeting in there until like 3.

1:10:59.135 --> 1:11:01.175
But then, they'll let us start.
I know we can do it.

1:11:02.135 --> 1:11:05.235
You are so great. I
owe you big time.

1:11:06.735 --> 1:11:08.836
What if I help you
re-decorate your room?

1:11:09.236 --> 1:11:11.236
I know, a nice sea foam green.

1:11:13.536 --> 1:11:16.536
- No.
- Okay, or something rich, like...

1:11:16.836 --> 1:11:17.836
like, eggplant.

1:11:19.236 --> 1:11:20.236
No.

1:11:20.736 --> 1:11:21.836
I mean...

1:11:22.636 --> 1:11:24.636
- I won't help you.
- But you have to.

1:11:25.837 --> 1:11:27.237
- No, I don't.
- But...

1:11:27.737 --> 1:11:28.737
Why?

1:11:28.837 --> 1:11:31.737
Because I was nice to you
in the beginning of school,

1:11:32.337 --> 1:11:34.437
when I didn't even like you.

1:11:35.337 --> 1:11:37.337
And you blew me off.

1:11:38.637 --> 1:11:41.337
Because you're a self-centered
social-climber.

1:11:42.237 --> 1:11:44.397
And you know what?
I know what I want to do to my room.

1:11:45.038 --> 1:11:46.838
And it doesn't involve eggplant.

1:11:49.738 --> 1:11:51.538
I think you should go.

1:13:03.042 --> 1:13:04.542
Why should I worry about Rachel?

1:13:05.942 --> 1:13:08.242
This'll hurt her.

1:13:08.842 --> 1:13:10.342
We were best friends
for nine years.

1:13:10.942 --> 1:13:12.343
That counts for something.

1:13:13.243 --> 1:13:14.943
She's a traitor.

1:13:15.343 --> 1:13:17.223
- And a witch.
- She doesn't know what happened.

1:13:18.243 --> 1:13:21.243
- She'll hate me.
- She already hates you.

1:13:25.643 --> 1:13:27.143
I hope he breaks her heart.

1:15:26.850 --> 1:15:28.050
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:15:29.750 --> 1:15:32.750
- Homework?
- Kind of.

1:15:32.950 --> 1:15:36.451
I'm going to France this summer
with the International Club.

1:15:36.551 --> 1:15:37.551
That's great.

1:15:38.151 --> 1:15:40.151
I mean, you always
talked about traveling.

1:15:43.051 --> 1:15:45.239
Do you remember when we
read "Heidi" and then

1:15:45.251 --> 1:15:47.451
we tried to melt the
cheese in the fireplace?

1:15:59.152 --> 1:16:00.852
So you're going
to prom with him?

1:16:02.352 --> 1:16:04.152
Yeah.

1:16:04.552 --> 1:16:05.652
He's so great.

1:16:07.252 --> 1:16:09.852
So awesome, and
gorgeous and yummy.

1:16:12.453 --> 1:16:14.373
What are you going to do
when he goes to college?

1:16:15.853 --> 1:16:18.653
I can't even think about it.
It hurts too much.

1:16:20.553 --> 1:16:22.653
He said he'd transfer
somewhere around here.

1:16:23.253 --> 1:16:24.553
I'll wait for him.

1:16:25.053 --> 1:16:27.553
But you've only been going out
with him for like 2 months.

1:16:30.754 --> 1:16:32.354
What do you want, anyway?

1:16:35.454 --> 1:16:37.654
I'm just really sorry we
couldn't be friends this year.

1:16:41.154 --> 1:16:44.954
- Are you still mad about the party?
- No.

1:16:46.355 --> 1:16:49.655
I mean, it was dumb to call the
cops, but we could've just left.

1:17:17.056 --> 1:17:20.756
"I was raped."

1:17:25.657 --> 1:17:27.657
Oh my God, why
didn't you tell me?

1:17:30.357 --> 1:17:33.657
When police came, everyone started
freaking out. I got scared.

1:17:34.557 --> 1:17:36.057
I walked home.

1:17:36.557 --> 1:17:39.357
After that night, I
couldn't tell anyone.

1:17:43.658 --> 1:17:45.258
Did you get pregnant?
Did you get AIDS?

1:17:45.358 --> 1:17:46.358
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1:17:47.358 --> 1:17:49.458
I mean, no, I didn't
get pregnant.

1:17:51.058 --> 1:17:52.058
I'm fine.

1:17:54.158 --> 1:17:55.458
Was it someone from the school?

1:17:59.759 --> 1:18:00.759
Who was it?

1:18:04.659 --> 1:18:06.459
Melinda, tell me.

1:18:09.459 --> 1:18:11.759
It was Andy Evans.

1:18:12.459 --> 1:18:13.459
What?

1:18:13.859 --> 1:18:15.960
I can't believe you!

1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:19.060
Liar! You're jealous!
I'm popular...

1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:21.040
and I'm going to Prom. And
now you tell me this?

1:18:21.860 --> 1:18:24.060
That's twisted, Melinda. Seriously.
You're sick.

1:18:24.660 --> 1:18:25.660
You need help.

1:18:53.162 --> 1:18:54.262
Coming?

1:18:58.462 --> 1:18:59.962
Hello?

1:19:01.062 --> 1:19:02.862
Earth to Rochelle.

1:19:05.162 --> 1:19:08.162
Alright. Okay.

1:19:09.263 --> 1:19:10.663
What did I do this time?

1:19:14.763 --> 1:19:15.763
Tell me.

1:19:21.763 --> 1:19:24.463
Remember when you asked
me about Melinda Sordino?

1:19:26.363 --> 1:19:27.864
The girl in the art room.

1:19:31.164 --> 1:19:33.264
Why did you ask me if I
was friends with her?

1:19:37.264 --> 1:19:38.264
Do you know her?

1:19:41.964 --> 1:19:43.364
How do you know her?

1:19:45.765 --> 1:19:47.065
I was looking for you.

1:19:49.865 --> 1:19:50.965
Bitch.

1:20:03.766 --> 1:20:07.266
A revolutionary is only
as good as his analysis.

1:20:08.066 --> 1:20:09.066
What does that mean?

1:20:16.466 --> 1:20:18.266
Melinda. Better late than never.

1:20:18.766 --> 1:20:22.567
Why's a revolutionary only as
good as his or her analysis?

1:20:25.267 --> 1:20:28.567
I think you should know what you stand
for, not just what you're against.

1:20:29.167 --> 1:20:31.287
We should be able to shout
how things could be better.

1:20:33.367 --> 1:20:36.267
That's pretty darn good.

1:20:39.368 --> 1:20:41.668
Rochelle, so glad
you could join us.

1:20:49.168 --> 1:20:52.168
- I need to talk with you for one second.
- No, let go. Andy get off of me!

1:21:04.669 --> 1:21:06.569
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, stranger.

1:21:08.769 --> 1:21:12.369
- What's the occasion?
- I just came from a job interview.

1:21:12.769 --> 1:21:14.570
Really, how'd it go?

1:21:15.070 --> 1:21:17.370
Good, I think. Yeah?

1:21:18.670 --> 1:21:21.370
- Yeah.
- Dad, that is so great.

1:21:27.970 --> 1:21:31.870
Here's what I learned in Bio: If
the seed is planted too deep,

1:21:31.970 --> 1:21:33.050
it doesn't warm up in time.

1:21:34.071 --> 1:21:37.771
Once the plant surfaces, it sprouts
leaves so it can absorb more sun.

1:21:39.471 --> 1:21:43.571
If someone picks the flower, the plant
grows another bloom to produce more seeds.

1:21:48.971 --> 1:21:49.972
Melinda.

1:21:51.372 --> 1:21:53.872
Will you sign my yearbook?

1:21:54.272 --> 1:21:57.072
- I'm not in it.
- Yeah you are.

1:21:57.572 --> 1:21:58.572
Right here.

1:22:01.772 --> 1:22:03.272
Doesn't really look like you.

1:22:08.273 --> 1:22:09.673
It is me.

1:22:17.673 --> 1:22:19.923
Hey, uh, do you want to
go out for some Chinese

1:22:19.935 --> 1:22:21.773
food tonight?
A bunch of us are going.

1:22:22.273 --> 1:22:23.373
Do you want to come?

1:22:24.873 --> 1:22:26.674
Yeah, sure.

1:22:29.874 --> 1:22:31.374
Thanks.

1:22:32.974 --> 1:22:34.974
So, ah, what are you
up to this summer?

1:22:36.374 --> 1:22:38.274
I'm going to take an
Art class in the city.

1:22:38.874 --> 1:22:39.874
That's cool.

1:22:40.774 --> 1:22:45.175
I think I'm going to intern at my Uncle's
lab. It's good experience for Pre-Med.

1:22:47.475 --> 1:22:50.675
I forgot something, but
call me about tonight, ok?

1:22:51.075 --> 1:22:52.075
Alright.

1:23:03.676 --> 1:23:06.276
Definitely check out the
ouiji exhibit at the "ICP".

1:23:06.876 --> 1:23:07.876
Hey, Melinda!

1:23:08.676 --> 1:23:09.343
Glad you're here.

1:23:09.355 --> 1:23:11.252
Thanks for everything Mr.
F and I really hope I

1:23:11.276 --> 1:23:13.476
make enough money so I can
afford one of your paintings.

1:23:14.276 --> 1:23:16.876
Yeah, alright, go.
Alright, go on, have fun.

1:23:17.776 --> 1:23:19.277
Make the world a better place.

1:23:23.377 --> 1:23:24.577
You leaving?

1:23:33.977 --> 1:23:35.177
I like to...

1:23:35.977 --> 1:23:39.378
I like to swear, play music.

1:23:39.778 --> 1:23:42.278
I hate giving grades.

1:23:46.078 --> 1:23:48.178
Have a nice life.

1:23:51.378 --> 1:23:53.478
I'm here if you want to talk.

1:23:54.879 --> 1:23:56.879
Even if I'm not...

1:23:58.479 --> 1:23:59.679
here.

1:24:05.279 --> 1:24:06.279
Can I show you something?

1:25:07.983 --> 1:25:09.283
It's really good.

1:25:29.484 --> 1:25:31.184
So, I raped you?

1:25:32.284 --> 1:25:34.124
I could have any girl in
this school, I wanted.

1:25:34.284 --> 1:25:35.284
Willingly.

1:25:35.684 --> 1:25:36.884
Why would I rape you?

1:25:37.184 --> 1:25:38.384
You're not even attractive.

1:25:39.984 --> 1:25:42.185
You really screwed things
up for me, you know that?

1:25:44.185 --> 1:25:46.394
Now you are going to go
to every single person

1:25:46.406 --> 1:25:48.485
in this school and tell
them that you lied.

1:25:48.885 --> 1:25:50.385
You are going to tell them!

1:25:52.485 --> 1:25:53.685
My eyes!

1:25:54.585 --> 1:25:55.685
Get off me!

1:26:01.486 --> 1:26:03.786
What's going on in there?
Open this door now!

1:26:11.886 --> 1:26:13.386
Come out, Melinda.

1:26:15.586 --> 1:26:16.786
It's Melinda Sordino.

1:26:21.887 --> 1:26:24.387
- Are you okay?
- What the hell is wrong with you?

1:26:24.887 --> 1:26:26.287
Answer me!

1:26:27.387 --> 1:26:28.987
Everybody knows what you did.

1:26:34.087 --> 1:26:35.688
Say something, asshole!

1:26:47.088 --> 1:26:49.088
Please, please.

1:26:49.488 --> 1:26:50.488
I can't see!

1:26:52.088 --> 1:26:53.989
Please move.
I can't see anything!

1:26:54.889 --> 1:26:56.889
I can't open my eyes!

1:27:19.790 --> 1:27:21.190
What's going on down there?

1:27:24.590 --> 1:27:25.590
What happened?

1:27:26.190 --> 1:27:27.190
Melinda?

1:29:22.097 --> 1:29:23.597
Dad changed his flight.

1:29:24.297 --> 1:29:25.797
He's going to be
home in a few hours.

1:29:26.197 --> 1:29:27.197
Why?

1:29:27.897 --> 1:29:30.697
I mean, I'm fine. Really.

1:29:31.097 --> 1:29:32.097
I am.

1:29:38.398 --> 1:29:40.718
Well you don't have to talk
about it, if you don't want to.

1:29:41.998 --> 1:29:43.798
No.

1:29:44.698 --> 1:29:45.898
I want to tell you about it.

1:29:56.799 --> 1:30:00.199
Last year. I went to this party
at the end of the year...
