00:16.558 --> 00:18.349
<i>Planet Ryloth invaded!</i>

00:18.474 --> 00:21.023
<i>Subjected to a brutal
droid occupation,</i>

00:21.158 --> 00:22.763
<i>the people of Ryloth are starving</i>

00:22.888 --> 00:24.812
<i>under the blockade
of a Separatists' fleet.</i>

00:24.937 --> 00:27.218
<i>Evil Separatist leader Wat Tambor</i>

00:27.343 --> 00:29.429
<i>now rules with an iron fist.</i>

00:29.905 --> 00:33.167
<i>Answering a pleas from the Senate,
the Grand Army of the Republic</i>

00:33.292 --> 00:35.724
<i>mounts a bold offensive
to liberate the system.</i>

00:35.849 --> 00:38.496
<i>It is up to Anakin Skywalker
and his padawan Ahsoka</i>

00:38.882 --> 00:41.082
<i>to make way
for Obi-Wan's ground assault.</i>

00:45.290 --> 00:47.090
<i>Captain, are you prepared?</i>

00:47.714 --> 00:50.114
Our blockade is impenetrable.

00:50.607 --> 00:52.528
When the Republic attacks,

00:52.970 --> 00:55.847
they will get quite a surprise.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.590
<i>I'm counting on you, Captain.</i>

00:59.038 --> 01:02.271
<i>We cannot allow the Republic
to invade this planet.</i>

01:06.215 --> 01:08.084
<i>All ships prepare for launch.</i>

01:12.862 --> 01:15.639
This is my first time
commanding a squadron R7,

01:15.764 --> 01:17.284
let's make a good impression.

01:28.295 --> 01:29.947
OK, are you boys ready?

01:30.340 --> 01:32.341
This is Two Ax.
Ready when you are, skipper.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.809
Ready on three. This is Slava. Over.

01:35.554 --> 01:38.013
Ready on four.
Kicked back, checking in.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.331
Soup to Blue leader.
Group Two is standing by. Over.

01:41.727 --> 01:44.477
Taco on five.
Waiting for mother bird. Over.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.576
Launch all fighters.

02:00.013 --> 02:01.163
Roger. Roger.

02:11.315 --> 02:14.800
- Tell Ahsoka the fleet is ready.
- Commander, you're all clear.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.418
Thank you, Admiral.

02:19.655 --> 02:20.705
Here we go.

02:28.728 --> 02:30.053
- <i>{\You are}Clear!
- I'm on it.</i>

02:30.178 --> 02:32.610
-<i> Nice work!
- Two new targets closing!</i>

02:34.284 --> 02:37.730
That is General Skywalker's
flagship.

02:38.447 --> 02:40.247
He is leading this attack.

02:41.036 --> 02:44.136
- Sir, their fighters are closing fast.
- Patience.

02:45.262 --> 02:49.050
Let's see what trickery
the Jedi have planned for us.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.591
We've got their fighters occupied.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.928
Ax, time for us to make a run
for the battleship.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.406
Come on you whiners,
let's get dirty!

03:09.651 --> 03:12.251
Sir, a squadron of fighters
are attacking.

03:12.376 --> 03:14.626
They have a clear path right to us.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.795
Now is the time to bring in
our reinforcements.

03:18.825 --> 03:21.784
Battlecruiser 17, Battlecruiser 19,

03:22.018 --> 03:23.318
attack position!

03:27.750 --> 03:30.735
Admiral, four more enemy cruisers
have joined the blockade.

03:30.860 --> 03:32.696
We've got to warn those fighters.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.938
Commander,
we've been caught in a trap!

03:35.063 --> 03:38.163
You're overreacting, Admiral.
I can get us through.

03:38.288 --> 03:40.177
Blue Squadron, stay the course.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.804
We're all set, Blue Leader.

03:42.075 --> 03:45.619
I'm ordering you to return to the ship.
We're going to need your help.

03:45.744 --> 03:47.394
Ahsoka, it's too risky.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.602
<i>Get your pilots out of there.</i>

03:49.771 --> 03:51.981
Sir, we've got their fighters
surrounded.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.149
Good.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.025
She's not turning around.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.280
Ax, are you still there?

03:59.448 --> 04:01.657
Got two on my tail.
I can't shake 'em!

04:03.811 --> 04:05.828
I can't help you, Ax,
I've got my own problem.

04:10.860 --> 04:13.925
- They're breaking our lines!
- Ahsoka, we are in trouble.

04:14.050 --> 04:15.378
I order you back here.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.897
Alright, alright.

04:17.022 --> 04:19.591
Let's go squad.
Pull back to the command ship.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.360
- Why are we retreating?
- We're not, we're following orders.

04:37.869 --> 04:39.508
Intensify deflector shields.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.906
There's too many.
We can't shoot them all!

04:42.074 --> 04:44.033
Fighter squadron, where are you?

04:44.201 --> 04:46.118
- We're almost there.
- It's too late!

04:46.533 --> 04:47.583
Run for it!

04:53.835 --> 04:55.635
Admiral, come in. Admiral!

04:55.962 --> 04:58.562
- Hang on, Admiral.
- Get us out of here!

04:59.148 --> 05:01.926
Get those fighters onboard
and prepare for lightspeed.

05:10.102 --> 05:13.144
<i>All fighters return!
We're preparing for lightspeed.</i>

05:13.626 --> 05:15.699
Right. Ax, stand on it!

05:15.824 --> 05:18.442
We only have a few seconds
to get onboard.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.360
Don't worry about me, skipper.

05:21.146 --> 05:24.196
Captain, the Republic space forces
are in retreat.

05:24.321 --> 05:25.621
Shall we pursue?

05:25.912 --> 05:28.378
No. Do not break our formation.

05:29.053 --> 05:30.653
Let those cowards run.

05:32.337 --> 05:34.332
My power converters,
they're failing!

05:34.501 --> 05:36.101
Just stay with me, Ax.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.427
Overload!

05:53.937 --> 05:56.387
Close up the hangar doors,
we're home.

06:07.519 --> 06:08.969
Jump to lightspeed.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.501
Get your squad together.
I need a head count.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.120
I need to know
how many we lost today.

06:25.987 --> 06:28.607
Ahsoka,
I am very disappointed in you.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.181
You not only disobeyed the Admiral,
you disobeyed me.

06:32.350 --> 06:36.757
I thought I could knock out those {\battle}ships
so{\when }Master Obi-Wan {\ arrived, he}could get through.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.347
I know you meant well, Snips,

06:39.716 --> 06:42.406
but there's a bigger picture
{\that}you're not aware of.

06:42.531 --> 06:45.904
First rule of war,
listen and obey your superiors.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.322
But sometimes you get carried away.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.951
All that means is I understand
what you're going through.

06:52.076 --> 06:54.576
- But I failed.
- It was a trap, Snips.

06:55.028 --> 06:56.372
It wasn't your fault.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.033
I lost so many of my pilots.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.403
Take heart, little one.

07:01.623 --> 07:03.623
That's the reality of command.

07:05.324 --> 07:07.377
General, we're approaching
our staging area.

07:07.502 --> 07:08.690
Very good, Captain.

07:08.815 --> 07:11.310
Master Windu requests a report
on our progress.

07:11.435 --> 07:12.585
Our progress?

07:12.814 --> 07:15.563
- We haven't made any progress yet.
- I'll tell him, sir.

07:15.688 --> 07:17.936
No, Rex.
I'll tell him myself, thank you.

07:18.253 --> 07:20.938
As soon as we tend to our wounded.
Get me a damage report.

07:21.063 --> 07:22.187
Right away, sir.

07:22.312 --> 07:24.443
Snips, I'm gonna need you to...

07:29.374 --> 07:32.373
<i>Captain, what is the status
of the enemy attack?</i>

07:32.498 --> 07:34.482
The Jedi were crushed, of course.

07:34.607 --> 07:38.565
They fled the system,
their ships in flames.

07:38.690 --> 07:42.697
I assure you our blockade
is very much intact.

07:43.493 --> 07:46.026
<i>Congratulations
are in order, Captain.</i>

07:46.324 --> 07:48.467
<i>But do not underestimate the Jedi.</i>

07:49.938 --> 07:51.011
Commander,

07:51.179 --> 07:54.189
bring me the archive data
on General Skywalker.

07:54.314 --> 07:56.605
I need to learn more
about our opponent.

07:56.730 --> 07:57.799
Roger, roger.

08:00.498 --> 08:02.314
They caught us by surprise, Master.

08:02.626 --> 08:05.751
- We were outnumbered.
- <i>How many men did you lose?</i>

08:06.194 --> 08:08.169
We lost a cruiser, the Redeemer,

08:08.294 --> 08:10.906
plus an entire squadron of fighters.

08:11.187 --> 08:13.125
<i>And your Padawan?</i>

08:13.326 --> 08:17.062
No, Ahsoka is fine.
She's just recovering from the battle.

08:17.187 --> 08:20.123
Losing her squadron
was hard to take.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.523
<i>Give her time, but, Anakin,</i>

08:22.648 --> 08:25.376
<i>you will need her help
if you're to get through this.</i>

08:25.547 --> 08:26.486
I know.

08:26.611 --> 08:29.123
<i>Your forces
have been cut in half, Skywalker.</i>

08:29.398 --> 08:33.109
<i>If you can't break that blockade
before the next planetary rotation,</i>

08:33.234 --> 08:34.972
<i>we'll have to postpone the invasion.</i>

08:35.140 --> 08:37.456
The Twi'leks
can't wait for ever, Master.

08:37.581 --> 08:40.409
The longer the Techno Union
keeps control of Ryloth,

08:40.668 --> 08:42.770
the more difficult
it'll be to free them.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.691
<i>I agree. We don't have much time.</i>

08:48.778 --> 08:50.863
Rex, see if you can find Ahsoka.

08:55.146 --> 08:56.702
He is stable for now.

09:01.020 --> 09:04.418
Admiral, I am so sorry.

09:06.461 --> 09:08.141
They're all gone.

09:10.209 --> 09:13.260
Commander Ahsoka,
General Skywalker is looking for you.

09:19.395 --> 09:20.851
No, R2, the other one.

09:22.604 --> 09:23.520
That's it.

09:24.603 --> 09:25.772
This'll do it.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.158
You wanted to see me, Master.

09:29.535 --> 09:30.535
Ahsoka!

09:31.037 --> 09:32.613
Hand me that socket plug.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.240
Here.

09:36.708 --> 09:37.908
Thanks, Snips.

09:38.379 --> 09:39.578
How are you feeling?

09:39.746 --> 09:42.831
Oh, I'm fine, Master. Just fine.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.834
That's good to hear.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.753
I'll need you levelled-headed
if we're gonna pull this off.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.773
Pull this off? Pull what off?

09:49.898 --> 09:51.585
I talked to Master Windu.

09:51.710 --> 09:54.259
We're to proceed
with our attack on the blockade.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.427
What?!

09:56.651 --> 09:57.471
We can't!

09:59.474 --> 10:03.482
We have to break that blockade.
The Twi'leks are depending on us.

10:03.895 --> 10:07.948
I understand that, Master,
but we've lost so many men.

10:08.461 --> 10:10.336
- Did we get more support?
- No.

10:10.461 --> 10:13.022
We have to make do
with the forces we have.

10:13.147 --> 10:16.834
- And I need to come up with a plan.
- You don't even have a plan?!

10:17.283 --> 10:18.883
Don't worry, Ahsoka.

10:20.528 --> 10:23.707
That's what you said last time
and now everyone's gone!

10:23.832 --> 10:24.957
My whole squadron!

10:25.729 --> 10:28.183
We can't just smash through
that blockade.

10:34.086 --> 10:35.336
Skywalker here.

10:35.461 --> 10:38.971
<i>The Defender is contacting us,
there seems to be a problem.</i>

10:39.139 --> 10:41.339
Alright, Rex, I'll be right there.

10:41.808 --> 10:45.310
Go back to your quarters and cool off!
We'll finish this talk later.

10:57.082 --> 10:59.423
Not a conventional Jedi

10:59.548 --> 11:02.485
to say the least it would seem.

11:03.466 --> 11:05.585
- Commander!
- Yes, Captain?

11:05.710 --> 11:10.335
Prepare all cannons and send
the droids to their battle stations.

11:10.460 --> 11:11.586
Yes, sir.

11:12.621 --> 11:15.007
Captain, are we under attack?

11:16.034 --> 11:20.004
But if Skywalker's record
indicates anything,

11:20.870 --> 11:22.303
he'll be back.

11:28.964 --> 11:31.014
Trooper, what's going on?

11:31.583 --> 11:33.942
The starship Defender
is being evacuated.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.028
Evacuated?! Why?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.362
I'm not sure{\, Commander}.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.808
We're on our way
to help General Skywalker in the hangar.

11:48.835 --> 11:51.585
Alright, men, this way.
Come on, move it.

11:51.959 --> 11:54.338
Move it! Let's go!
No time to waste!

11:54.520 --> 11:57.466
Master, I'm almost afraid to ask.

11:57.634 --> 12:00.802
- I ordered the Defender evacuated.
- I can see that.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.012
Why?

12:02.180 --> 12:04.723
Well, actually,
I got the idea from you.

12:05.084 --> 12:07.017
Oh,... great.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.802
Rex, take over will you.

12:08.927 --> 12:11.424
You said we couldn't smash
through the blockade,

12:11.549 --> 12:13.688
I decided that's partly true.

12:13.813 --> 12:16.816
You implied my plans
put a lot of people at risk

12:16.941 --> 12:20.079
- and I agree with you on that one.
- That's a first.

12:20.247 --> 12:22.284
{\I decided }The only way
we can break the blockade

12:22.409 --> 12:26.411
is if I pilot the Defender {\right }into their
battleship and take out the commander.

12:26.772 --> 12:29.959
- What?!
- This way I'm the only one at risk.

12:30.084 --> 12:32.626
Besides, the Defender
is damaged already.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.460
You can't be serious, Master.

12:35.585 --> 12:37.646
- You'll die!
- No, I won't.

12:37.771 --> 12:41.772
That's where you come in. The enemy
can't stop that ship taking them out,

12:42.195 --> 12:45.334
R2 and I will jettison an escape pod
right before impact.

12:45.515 --> 12:48.350
But the enemy fleet is right there!

12:48.520 --> 12:52.732
I know and I'll pretty much be
defenceless in an escape pod,

12:52.857 --> 12:54.939
so I'm depending on you

12:55.064 --> 12:57.984
to engage the remaining fleet
with our forces.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.467
Master, I...

13:00.781 --> 13:01.833
I can't.

13:01.958 --> 13:05.617
If something goes wrong,
I can't be responsible...

13:05.785 --> 13:07.959
You are responsible.

13:08.084 --> 13:12.082
These men are depending on you
and this time so am I.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.472
But, Master, last time I...

13:14.752 --> 13:16.253
Attention! Everyone!

13:16.522 --> 13:17.671
Attention!

13:18.174 --> 13:20.022
Alright, men, listen up.

13:20.147 --> 13:23.802
I'm taking over the Defender
and I'm leaving Ahsoka in charge.

13:24.083 --> 13:28.140
She'll lead the mission when we engage
what remains of the blockade.

13:28.944 --> 13:31.143
Commander Ahsoka
will fill you in on the full plan.

13:31.423 --> 13:33.270
- Master, wait!
- Good luck.

13:33.458 --> 13:34.458
Master!

13:34.939 --> 13:36.869
Awaiting orders, Commander.

13:37.527 --> 13:40.472
I'll be on the bridge.

13:41.835 --> 13:44.459
Well, you heard her, boys,
back to work!

13:44.584 --> 13:46.384
Come on! Move it! Move it!

13:59.672 --> 14:01.772
- Commander on deck.
- At ease.

14:04.269 --> 14:06.569
General Skywalker is contacting you.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.835
<i>Alright, Ahsoka,
we're ready to get under way.</i>

14:09.960 --> 14:10.891
Master,

14:11.059 --> 14:13.310
are you sure
you won't reconsider this?

14:13.478 --> 14:15.653
<i>This is the only way, trust me.</i>

14:18.959 --> 14:20.692
Better fill us in, Commander.

14:21.574 --> 14:22.574
Right.

14:27.079 --> 14:28.810
<i>Count Dooku has assured me</i>

14:28.935 --> 14:32.135
<i>the Republic forces
are stretched thin in our sector.</i>

14:32.824 --> 14:35.724
<i>They should be unable
to mount a counterattack.</i>

14:36.010 --> 14:38.746
<i>Any attempt to do so
would be suicide.</i>

14:39.253 --> 14:43.391
Still, I am certain
this Skywalker will return.

14:44.012 --> 14:45.874
He's ultimate defeat

14:45.999 --> 14:48.946
shall be my greatest victory.

14:50.011 --> 14:51.853
<i>You admire Skywalker?</i>

14:52.559 --> 14:53.959
As a general, yes,

14:54.479 --> 14:57.317
his record shows
he is a great warrior.

14:57.609 --> 15:00.404
And I want him to know it is I

15:01.125 --> 15:02.681
who has beaten him.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.572
I have to say
this plan is questionable.

15:07.761 --> 15:11.009
Yeah, but with their general destroyed
along with their battleship,

15:11.134 --> 15:13.386
the droid commanders
will be in chaos.

15:13.511 --> 15:14.861
Only temporarily.

15:15.010 --> 15:17.800
And there's still General Skywalker
to find in all that mess.

15:17.925 --> 15:18.761
I know.

15:18.886 --> 15:22.574
Our first attack had three
fully armed cruisers and we failed.

15:22.699 --> 15:25.924
I wish General Skywalker
had discussed this plan with us.

15:26.445 --> 15:28.593
The odds are very much against us.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.187
They always are.

15:30.574 --> 15:33.723
Yes, but normally we have
General Skywalker to lead us and...

15:36.024 --> 15:37.936
I meant no offence, Commander.

15:38.448 --> 15:39.498
None taken.

15:49.524 --> 15:52.671
Sir, an enemy ship
is emerging from hyperspace.

15:52.984 --> 15:55.387
I knew he'd return.

15:56.202 --> 15:58.081
There is
an incoming transmission, sir.

15:59.258 --> 16:00.508
Put it through.

16:03.024 --> 16:04.311
<i>Greetings, Captain.</i>

16:04.436 --> 16:07.132
<i>I'm Anakin Skywalker,
general of the Grand Army -</i>

16:07.301 --> 16:10.318
I know who you are, Skywalker.

16:10.976 --> 16:13.135
<i>My reputation precedes me, then.</i>

16:13.260 --> 16:15.077
<i>I've been ordered
to surrender myself,</i>

16:15.202 --> 16:17.450
<i>the entire crew
of this vessel and my ship</i>

16:17.575 --> 16:19.973
<i>in exchange for safe passage of food</i>

16:20.198 --> 16:22.731
<i>and medical supplies
to the people of Ryloth.</i>

16:22.899 --> 16:25.057
A noble gesture, Jedi.

16:25.622 --> 16:27.253
And your capture

16:27.378 --> 16:30.564
would make me
the envy of the Separatist fleet.

16:31.884 --> 16:36.037
Sir, even if Skywalker is successful
and destroys the battleship,

16:36.455 --> 16:40.459
how will we stand up to the combined
firepower of the remaining frigates?

16:41.418 --> 16:45.861
I thought about that and,
well, I have an idea.

16:46.232 --> 16:47.464
Go ahead, Commander.

16:47.813 --> 16:51.982
If we took the Resolute and angled
her hull against the incoming frigates

16:52.107 --> 16:56.157
the bridge and hangar deck would be
relatively safe from their attack.

16:56.282 --> 17:00.013
We could draw them in and then
use the bombers to outflank them.

17:00.138 --> 17:03.396
The bombers would be too fast
and they would be trapped.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.147
I'm not sure about this, Commander.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.316
I think...

17:06.515 --> 17:09.027
If we were certain
the shields would hold.

17:09.195 --> 17:12.696
Perhaps a different strategy.
We need to take more time and plan.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.363
No! We don't have any more time!

17:16.761 --> 17:19.202
Master Skywalker needs me now!

17:19.634 --> 17:21.727
He needs us now.

17:22.428 --> 17:24.078
The Commander is right.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.400
I know this strategy is very bold,

17:27.823 --> 17:30.873
but these circumstances
call for drastic measures.

17:30.998 --> 17:33.218
Then, the strategy will work, sir?

17:33.637 --> 17:35.379
Well, will it?

17:36.729 --> 17:38.560
Yes, it will.

17:42.639 --> 17:45.436
We have completed
the scan of the enemy ship.

17:45.561 --> 17:46.561
And?

17:46.891 --> 17:48.733
The ship is heavily damaged.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.448
All power is diverted
to the forward shields.

17:51.573 --> 17:53.613
There is only one life-form onboard.

17:53.782 --> 17:56.073
- What?!
- The ship is heavily damaged.

17:56.198 --> 17:58.898
- All power is...
- No, you insolent scrub!

17:59.675 --> 18:01.875
Skywalker, what treachery is this?

18:02.263 --> 18:04.413
You have nothing to bargain with.

18:05.011 --> 18:06.911
<i>In that case, I'll be going.</i>

18:07.670 --> 18:09.520
<i>You can still have my ship.</i>

18:11.887 --> 18:14.987
There's a second Republic ship
entering the system.

18:15.551 --> 18:16.479
She made it!

18:16.604 --> 18:19.304
Boost the engines
and let's get outta here.

18:26.635 --> 18:28.870
When those two ships collide
there'll be chaos.

18:28.995 --> 18:30.121
We need that time

18:30.246 --> 18:33.111
to get General Skywalker's pod
into the tractor beam.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.863
Right, Commander.

18:36.114 --> 18:37.658
I'll man the fighter squadron.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.868
Wait for my signal
to begin our attack.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.036
Yes, sir.

18:43.608 --> 18:46.497
All canons, fire! Fire!

19:00.056 --> 19:01.612
We can't stop it!

19:01.891 --> 19:05.590
- What should we do?
- You stay here. I'll be back.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.162
That's great.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.570
See, I told you it would work.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.577
<i>Approaching your position.
Standby for retrieval.</i>

19:19.702 --> 19:20.992
Right on time, Ahsoka.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.295
I don't think
they're going to attack.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.971
- <i>We'll have to retreat.</i>
- No! Wait!

19:35.428 --> 19:37.603
Remember, they are droids.

19:37.827 --> 19:39.434
They're just a little slow.

19:39.559 --> 19:41.221
They'll figure it out.

19:41.994 --> 19:43.882
<i>I think the Captain left.</i>

19:44.440 --> 19:47.094
- <i>Who's in charge?
- Not me.</i>

19:48.310 --> 19:50.897
- <i>What should we do?</i>
- Begin attack.

20:00.393 --> 20:02.013
The droids are attacking, sir.

20:02.138 --> 20:05.078
Commander, on your order.
Commence flanking manoeuvre.

20:05.556 --> 20:07.392
OK, boys, here we go.

20:07.517 --> 20:08.790
Follow my lead.

20:25.659 --> 20:28.159
<i>- We've been outflanked!
- Affirmative!</i>

20:30.187 --> 20:31.521
That-a girl, Ahsoka.

20:39.988 --> 20:42.538
<i>Where is the Captain?
What is going on?!</i>

20:42.784 --> 20:44.744
He's in... an escape pod.

20:44.995 --> 20:47.599
<i>Idiots!
The blockade has been broken!</i>

20:49.215 --> 20:51.167
Where are those escape pods?

20:53.543 --> 20:56.337
<i>Commander, the invasion fleet
is coming out of hyperspace.</i>

20:58.641 --> 21:00.341
Ahsoka, this is Obi-Wan,

21:00.529 --> 21:02.051
may we begin our landing?

21:02.325 --> 21:05.138
Yes, Master.
You're cleared for ground assault.

21:05.369 --> 21:08.079
I won't even ask
where the rest of Anakin's fleet is,

21:08.204 --> 21:10.799
or why he's in an escape pod.

21:11.202 --> 21:13.538
That's probably for the best.

21:14.013 --> 21:15.514
Rex, that reminds me,

21:15.639 --> 21:18.067
send a shuttle
to pick up Master Skywalker.

21:31.629 --> 21:33.579
<i>General, are you still there?</i>

21:34.086 --> 21:36.886
Yep. I'm just sitting here
watching the show.
