WEBVTT

01:26.548 --> 01:28.010
Frank, who found the floaters?

01:28.292 --> 01:29.702
Couple down here on their honeymoon.

01:32.241 --> 01:33.536
See how long they last

01:33.571 --> 01:34.831
Any chance they did it?

01:35.023 --> 01:36.280
No. They were just here for the day.

01:36.331 --> 01:37.606
Bodies found them.

01:37.641 --> 01:38.882
Oye, Tony, mas alla.

01:40.344 --> 01:41.729
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.

01:41.818 --> 01:43.242
Ma'am, jurisdiction?

01:43.267 --> 01:44.663
Another mile east and
this would be Federal,

01:44.664 --> 01:46.061
but we're still in Florida waters.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.485
Okay, so it's still ours. Where's Eric?

01:47.985 --> 01:49.393
He's already down there.

01:51.062 --> 01:52.447
Eric, what do you got?

01:52.485 --> 01:54.793
Five bodies, all male, tied together.

01:55.203 --> 01:56.459
Five bodies tied together.

01:56.460 --> 01:58.037
Could be a ship's crew.

01:58.588 --> 02:00.690
Ma'am, have any ships
disappeared in the last week?

02:00.691 --> 02:02.088
No, sir.

02:02.627 --> 02:05.011
Okay. So that means the killer
could still be out there.

02:05.063 --> 02:06.601
Probably long gone by now.

02:06.806 --> 02:08.524
Hijack a boat, kill the whole crew,

02:08.651 --> 02:09.579
sell off the cargo.

02:09.614 --> 02:11.627
Frank, they used to have
another name for that.

02:11.883 --> 02:13.217
Piracy?

02:13.460 --> 02:14.258
Come on, Horatio.

02:14.293 --> 02:16.395
$35 billion lost last year,

02:16.396 --> 02:18.345
and dozens of ships gone missing.

02:18.409 --> 02:20.076
In Malaysia, Indonesia...

02:20.217 --> 02:21.345
Not Miami.

02:21.371 --> 02:23.666
It's been ten years since
a Florida ship got pirated.

02:23.794 --> 02:25.102
Until now.

03:19.610 --> 03:20.952
All right.

03:21.481 --> 03:23.318
Make sure we slice that
body bag, all right?

03:23.319 --> 03:25.085
I don't want the whole
ocean. Just the body.

03:26.038 --> 03:27.710
What the hell's taking so long?

03:28.157 --> 03:29.875
There's a process out here,too, Frank.

03:30.395 --> 03:32.243
We got three divers standing around.

03:32.808 --> 03:34.149
Not just standing around, all right?

03:34.150 --> 03:35.408
We've got to pace them.

03:35.409 --> 03:37.562
Put them all in at once,
they'll OD on nitrogen.

03:37.563 --> 03:39.011
We'll lose them until tomorrow.

03:39.028 --> 03:40.464
I'd settle for one or two.

03:41.406 --> 03:42.854
Well, unless we know
what we're looking for,

03:43.030 --> 03:44.724
they're going to go down there
and kick up the sea floor.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.515
Visibility will drop to zero.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.293
Slow and steady, Frank.

03:48.364 --> 03:49.765
Trust me.

03:53.909 --> 03:55.151
What have we got?

03:55.186 --> 03:56.393
This level of decomp,

03:56.404 --> 03:58.594
Frank, I'm just not
sure how much we'll get.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.055
You got lost out there
for a while, didn't you?

04:05.396 --> 04:07.103
Okay, I'm never eating shellfish again.

04:08.881 --> 04:11.294
Why was this guy sinking? Shouldn't
they all have been floating?

04:11.694 --> 04:13.507
Two phases. First, they sink.

04:13.801 --> 04:16.096
Then the gases expand, and they rise.

04:21.740 --> 04:23.200
Then these guys get 'em.

04:23.483 --> 04:24.825
Pop go the floaters.

04:26.814 --> 04:29.404
Then the gases escape, and
they sink back down for good.

04:34.172 --> 04:35.949
So, if those divers hadn't found them,

04:35.950 --> 04:37.339
nobody would have.

04:45.963 --> 04:47.399
Hands are callused.

04:47.823 --> 04:49.247
Scarring, too.

04:49.294 --> 04:50.494
Looks like rope burns.

04:50.495 --> 04:51.413
Hook marks.

04:51.448 --> 04:53.367
These guys worked for a living.

04:53.838 --> 04:55.380
They're all wearing deck boots, too.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.335
If you ask me, it adds up to fishermen.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.021
The last one?

05:10.108 --> 05:11.155
Frank.

05:11.156 --> 05:12.392
Yeah?

05:14.652 --> 05:16.159
What else we got here, Delko?

05:16.734 --> 05:18.229
Tissue on the rope.

05:19.029 --> 05:20.512
Skin could have sloughed right off.

05:23.338 --> 05:24.880
So we got a knot, and no hand.

05:25.904 --> 05:27.999
Means there's at least
one more body down there.

06:11.260 --> 06:12.542
What did you get, Alexx?

06:12.557 --> 06:14.664
Got myself a six-pack, Horatio.

06:14.801 --> 06:16.298
I already called in the night shift.

06:16.312 --> 06:17.678
You got a time of death?

06:17.867 --> 06:19.029
No.

06:19.072 --> 06:20.373
This level of decomp, if

06:20.408 --> 06:23.169
the water temperature stays
consistent at 75 degrees,

06:23.204 --> 06:25.784
I'd say five, six days ago.

06:26.074 --> 06:27.332
Okay. What else?

06:27.367 --> 06:29.604
This one's lungs were full of water.

06:29.831 --> 06:31.892
So they were alive when
they were thrown in.

06:33.884 --> 06:35.264
Help me!

06:45.998 --> 06:48.207
All of them tied
together to that anchor,

06:48.294 --> 06:50.284
they must have sunk like stones.

06:53.823 --> 06:55.508
This looks like some type of a

06:55.683 --> 06:56.932
Band-Aid.

07:03.696 --> 07:04.974
Waterproof.

07:05.003 --> 07:06.558
Might have preserved trace.

07:06.703 --> 07:08.490
Tell us what kind of
boat he was working.

07:08.534 --> 07:10.538
Maybe dead men do tell tales.

07:28.986 --> 07:30.294
Mr. Wolfe.

07:30.308 --> 07:32.429
Trace from under the anchor
man's Band-Aid came back

07:32.464 --> 07:33.856
as fish scales.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.674
Based on the dimension...

07:39.858 --> 07:41.210
Bluefin tuna.

07:41.268 --> 07:43.142
That's an expensive catch, isn't it?

07:43.206 --> 07:45.923
Prime specimens can go for $150,000.

07:46.111 --> 07:48.334
They're hand-tested for
lactic acid and fat content,

07:48.369 --> 07:50.557
then flown to Japan to be
fed to the Royal Family.

07:50.621 --> 07:52.539
Commercial long liners are allowed two

07:52.574 --> 07:54.297
bluefins per boat legally.

07:54.311 --> 07:55.924
Right. Illegally, if they decided

07:55.959 --> 07:58.001
to try their luck poaching,

07:58.103 --> 07:59.730
they make a year's pay in one trip.

07:59.750 --> 08:01.100
Explains why somebody would kill

08:01.101 --> 08:02.554
for the cargo, doesn't it?

08:02.612 --> 08:04.646
Those bodies were in
the water for six days.

08:04.681 --> 08:06.651
Somebody's got to be missing a boat.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.975
I checked with all
the big fishing fleets.

08:08.981 --> 08:10.448
None of them have an overdue boat.

08:10.483 --> 08:11.648
What about the harbourmaster?

08:11.683 --> 08:14.472
Did that already, too. 46
boats went out last week,

08:14.507 --> 08:16.172
and only one didn't return

08:16.608 --> 08:19.165
the Eileen. Owner's
name is Owen Harrell.

08:20.874 --> 08:23.068
Okay, Gentlemen, let's go fishing.

08:28.594 --> 08:30.570
Bluefin? You got to be kidding me.

08:31.252 --> 08:32.265
They catch me fishing for those,

08:32.301 --> 08:34.254
F and W would shut down my whole fleet.

08:34.289 --> 08:36.265
When was the last time
you heard from the Eileen?

08:36.817 --> 08:38.544
Four days... maybe five.

08:38.892 --> 08:40.243
Or six.

08:42.030 --> 08:43.773
We believe your ship's been pirated

08:43.817 --> 08:46.316
And you didn't report it, Owen.
Do you have something to hide?

08:46.446 --> 08:48.916
No, but I got a business to run.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.211
Look, no knock on you guys,

08:51.246 --> 08:53.774
but I report my boat
missing to the authorities,

08:53.809 --> 08:56.302
my insurance goes through
the roof, and I go under.

08:56.389 --> 08:59.178
I got 30 guys on the payroll
who'd be out of a job.

08:59.541 --> 09:01.430
Try being known as the
guy who got pirated.

09:01.546 --> 09:03.696
You know, you seem more
concerned about your business

09:03.731 --> 09:05.643
than the six crew members you lost.

09:06.006 --> 09:07.328
Six?

09:07.735 --> 09:09.319
The Eileen crews nine.

09:09.485 --> 09:10.778
Nine.

09:12.390 --> 09:15.136
Eric, call the Coast Guard and
say we've got a rescue mission.

09:15.165 --> 09:16.371
Owen,

09:16.406 --> 09:18.579
if anybody else dies
because you kept quiet,

09:18.614 --> 09:20.779
you're going to be the one
on the hook. You understand?

09:28.379 --> 09:30.015
The Eileen left six days ago,

09:30.050 --> 09:31.778
and the time of death
tells us that the pirates

09:31.813 --> 09:33.211
must have hit them right away.

09:33.246 --> 09:35.701
If it happened that quickly, it
probably only made it a few miles out,

09:36.137 --> 09:37.502
even under full steam.

09:37.522 --> 09:39.731
Let's say they had a life
raft. Where would they end up?

09:39.905 --> 09:41.517
Most life rafts don't have engines.

09:41.619 --> 09:43.290
They'd be at the mercy of
the wind and the currents.

09:44.132 --> 09:45.614
So they could be anywhere?

09:46.079 --> 09:47.097
Not anywhere.

09:47.132 --> 09:49.471
From this location, everything funnels
right into the Florida Current.

09:49.602 --> 09:51.127
Which only heads north, right?

09:51.351 --> 09:52.804
All the way to New England.

09:58.237 --> 10:00.547
NOAA buoys are clocking
the current at two knots.

10:01.584 --> 10:03.400
So, after six days...

10:05.928 --> 10:07.505
This is best estimate.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.356
We're still talking
about a huge search area.

10:09.551 --> 10:11.381
Okay. It's good. It's a start. Thanks.

10:16.568 --> 10:18.834
Miami Ops to 5-23. This is RCC.

10:20.380 --> 10:22.734
Drift computations suggest
expanding your search grid

10:22.777 --> 10:24.480
five miles to the northeast.

10:26.685 --> 10:28.414
This is 5-23. Copy that.

10:30.912 --> 10:32.611
RCC, we have contact.

10:33.338 --> 10:36.476
26.147 north, 80.417 west.

10:38.487 --> 10:40.332
Three Pubs. Preparing to deploy.

11:12.917 --> 11:14.547
Thank God you found us.

11:15.430 --> 11:17.001
They don't look like fishermen, do they?

11:17.005 --> 11:18.524
They're not. Coast Guard says

11:18.559 --> 11:20.855
they're college students
from the College of Miami

11:20.890 --> 11:22.671
doing a Semester at Sea.

11:23.426 --> 11:24.995
Guess they just graduated.

11:25.045 --> 11:28.197
Life raft checks out from the
Eileen. They were the only survivors.

11:29.854 --> 11:32.309
Two survivors and one non survivor, huh?

11:32.614 --> 11:33.552
Think they were in on it?

11:33.587 --> 11:35.476
I don't know. Let's check with Homicide.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.857
They're taking the
corpse to the morgue now.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.821
I'll have Alexx check it out.

11:41.213 --> 11:43.697
Yeah. Our body count just went up.

11:54.798 --> 11:57.311
Hey, Alexx, have you got
anything on our dead castaway?

11:57.718 --> 12:00.347
Could be exposure... Could be dehydration

12:00.609 --> 12:02.483
Or could be amputation.

12:02.657 --> 12:04.168
Amputation?

12:06.062 --> 12:07.277
His leg..

12:07.312 --> 12:08.910
fourth degree avulsion

12:08.945 --> 12:10.508
from multiple bite marks.

12:10.523 --> 12:12.818
Flesh was literally
ripped from the bone.

12:12.891 --> 12:14.474
Are you thinking a shark attack?

12:14.509 --> 12:15.559
Looks that way.

12:15.594 --> 12:17.948
Deep incisions, crescent-shaped wounds.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.476
I'm thinking a small
blue or tiger shark.

12:21.042 --> 12:23.381
It would have to be a very
small one. Look at this bite.

12:25.449 --> 12:27.294
That not from an apex predator.

12:27.308 --> 12:28.906
At least not an aquatic one.

12:30.277 --> 12:31.992
What kind of predator are you thinking?

12:32.326 --> 12:33.822
Two-footed.

12:34.316 --> 12:35.769
A human?

12:36.277 --> 12:38.224
Are you talking about cannibalism?

12:39.654 --> 12:41.397
There's no other explanation.

12:43.707 --> 12:45.407
How is it that only the non-fishermen

12:45.442 --> 12:47.136
managed to elude the pirates?

12:47.862 --> 12:49.257
Dumb luck.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.110
I was on deck watch.

12:51.502 --> 12:53.274
Saw a boat approaching, lights out.

12:53.666 --> 12:55.889
Before I knew it, guys with
guns were swarming the place.

12:55.924 --> 12:57.662
Yeah, there's still
something I don't understand.

12:57.667 --> 12:58.902
Look, man,

12:58.917 --> 13:00.689
I wasn't going to alert the
rest of the crew and get killed

13:00.724 --> 13:03.072
with them. I got my boys,
and we bailed out of there.

13:03.159 --> 13:04.757
Actually, that wasn't my question.

13:05.387 --> 13:07.930
I was just wondering when you
decided to eat your friend, Chip?

13:08.220 --> 13:09.688
On the life raft.

13:09.723 --> 13:10.611
What?!

13:10.646 --> 13:11.954
That's sick.

13:11.983 --> 13:13.566
We have evidence.

13:14.089 --> 13:15.688
Human bite marks on his leg.

13:16.758 --> 13:18.385
It was bad out there, but not that bad.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.535
Six days at sea, no food, no water

13:21.901 --> 13:23.136
You must've been pretty desperate.

13:23.171 --> 13:24.676
I didn't eat the guy, okay?

13:24.705 --> 13:26.317
Then how do you explain the marks?

13:29.006 --> 13:31.301
Brian wouldn't shut up
about how hungry he was.

13:31.388 --> 13:33.538
There's a fish, there's
a fish. I see a fish.

13:33.843 --> 13:35.165
Damn it!

13:35.267 --> 13:36.560
That's the tenth one I've lost.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.469
You're not going to catch anything.

13:39.297 --> 13:41.040
You're going to capsize us.

13:43.670 --> 13:44.977
Are you saying Brian did it?

13:44.983 --> 13:47.351
I was passed out half the
time, but it wasn't me, so

13:47.990 --> 13:49.385
you do the math.

13:50.867 --> 13:52.319
Brian, you need to tell me exactly

13:52.354 --> 13:53.845
what happened on that raft.

13:57.396 --> 13:59.342
Chip was in really bad shape.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.115
Even before the shark.

14:02.006 --> 14:03.735
Sunken eyes, uh,

14:04.287 --> 14:05.740
blue lips...

14:05.755 --> 14:07.672
Those are classic signs of dehydration.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.171
Day Three, he started to lose it.

14:10.679 --> 14:12.176
He was seeing things.

14:12.183 --> 14:14.144
In severe cases, dehydration can lead

14:14.179 --> 14:15.844
to cell death in the brain,

14:16.106 --> 14:17.965
cause hallucinations, dementia.

14:23.521 --> 14:25.061
We couldn't control him.

14:25.889 --> 14:27.494
I see land. I see land.

14:27.529 --> 14:28.643
We can swim for it.

14:28.678 --> 14:30.204
There's nothing out there!

14:31.460 --> 14:32.521
No!

14:33.122 --> 14:34.488
Chip! No!

14:37.524 --> 14:38.803
Shark!

14:45.041 --> 14:46.480
By the time we

14:46.756 --> 14:48.339
got him back on board...

14:49.779 --> 14:51.130
shark had gotten him.

14:51.478 --> 14:52.917
Shark wasn't the only one.

14:53.541 --> 14:54.994
His corpse was masticated

14:55.038 --> 14:56.737
by one or more humans.

14:56.781 --> 14:58.030
News to me.

14:59.460 --> 15:00.035
What's this?

15:00.070 --> 15:01.639
It's a warrant to pump your stomach.

15:01.668 --> 15:02.939
Adam's as well.

15:02.974 --> 15:04.124
You're crazy.

15:04.159 --> 15:07.635
You think this is going
to bring Chip back?

15:07.659 --> 15:09.596
Maybe part of him.

15:40.826 --> 15:41.660
Eric.

15:41.702 --> 15:43.217
You found paint on the life raft?

15:43.228 --> 15:44.544
Transfer.

15:44.637 --> 15:47.796
Paint chips tell us it
was olive-drab green.

15:47.925 --> 15:49.017
Military issue?

15:49.052 --> 15:51.483
Yeah, but not U.S. military.

15:51.509 --> 15:55.567
Ran x-ray diffraction. The lead and
chromium oxide levels tell us that, uh,

15:55.602 --> 15:57.285
the paint was foreign-made.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.247
This life raft was used to haul gear.

16:02.316 --> 16:06.109
Why would a commercial fishing
boat need military equipment?

16:06.132 --> 16:07.165
They wouldn't.

16:07.236 --> 16:09.068
I mean, at least not for anything legal.

16:09.103 --> 16:11.710
Maybe guns, explosives.

16:11.734 --> 16:13.601
Not the kind of cargo we'd return.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.280
Neither will the pirates.

16:15.292 --> 16:16.548
So they hit the lottery.

16:16.572 --> 16:19.836
So Owen the ship owner
loses again. Thank you.

16:25.355 --> 16:28.937
You bring me all the way down
here to tell me you found my ship?

16:28.972 --> 16:33.352
No, sir. What we found, is that
your ship is smuggling weapons.

16:35.861 --> 16:37.141
What the hell is that?

16:37.165 --> 16:39.740
Those are paint chips
from the weapons' cases,

16:39.775 --> 16:42.543
and when I figure out what's
inside them, you will be charged.

16:47.248 --> 16:50.512
We used to fish all we
wanted, right offshore.

16:50.674 --> 16:55.746
Now my own government tells me I
gotta go to Haiti to catch anything.

16:56.016 --> 16:59.504
So I make a little cash on the side.

16:59.537 --> 17:02.038
Maybe a delivery when we're down there.

17:02.097 --> 17:06.594
But it's strictly export, though. We would
never bring weapons into this country.

17:06.615 --> 17:11.170
But pirates would, and that's why we
need to know everything about your ship.

17:12.262 --> 17:13.765
Ship records give us anything?

17:13.789 --> 17:16.102
No, nothing we didn't already know.

17:16.123 --> 17:17.516
So we got a whole ocean out there,

17:17.550 --> 17:21.246
all we know is we're looking for a
blue long-liner by the name of "Eileen."

17:21.253 --> 17:23.285
Actually, we don't even know that.

17:23.411 --> 17:27.486
First thing pirates do is take a hijacked
boat and turn it into a phantom ship.

17:27.509 --> 17:28.390
How's that?

17:28.402 --> 17:31.020
Well, they repaint it,
and then they rename it.

17:38.754 --> 17:40.362
Well, the boat was blue.

17:40.703 --> 17:43.568
Only way you're going to cover
that up that quick is black.

17:43.918 --> 17:47.617
Pirates don't usually dry-dock so they
probably have to paint it on the water.

17:47.652 --> 17:49.331
On an 80-foot boat?

17:49.519 --> 17:50.857
That's a helluva lot of paint.

17:50.996 --> 17:54.084
I've been calling marine supply
stores, see who's been buying.

17:54.178 --> 17:57.901
I just talked to a guy
at Dawkin's Boat Supply.

17:57.910 --> 18:02.912
Said that he just sold ten cases
of marine paint- Boot-Top Black.

18:03.111 --> 18:05.072
I've fished up and down
the coast all my whole life.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.021
I've never heard of
Dawkin's Boat Supply.

18:07.278 --> 18:09.168
That's because it's not on the coast.

18:09.227 --> 18:11.117
It's up the Miami River.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.548
Well, that's where we're going.

18:34.493 --> 18:36.266
Marine paint's nasty stuff, huh?

18:36.289 --> 18:37.945
Yeah, thanks.

18:38.753 --> 18:40.561
You got a handkerchief or something?

18:40.585 --> 18:41.630
I don't think so.

18:43.603 --> 18:47.266
Well, at least we know
it's oil-based- it floats.

18:47.533 --> 18:50.152
And we know somebody's
been painting in the water.

18:51.197 --> 18:53.627
Hey, we got something up here. Look.

18:55.095 --> 18:56.868
Take it around the bend.

19:03.347 --> 19:05.273
Hey. Cut the engine.

19:23.978 --> 19:25.328
I'll call H.

19:25.340 --> 19:26.502
You call SWAT.

19:45.909 --> 19:48.234
Surveillance has had eyes on
the boat since we found it.

19:48.251 --> 19:49.578
Okay, how many on board?

19:49.602 --> 19:52.091
Seen two come up so far. Not
sure how many more below deck.

19:58.262 --> 19:59.647
SWAT is moving into position.

19:59.671 --> 20:01.232
SWAT 2, do you copy?

20:01.761 --> 20:02.817
Copy. Go ahead.

20:04.177 --> 20:06.408
Prepare to board on my count.

20:08.040 --> 20:08.980
And one...

20:11.140 --> 20:12.126
and...two...

20:18.137 --> 20:18.771
...and...

20:18.794 --> 20:19.992
Everybody down!

20:41.699 --> 20:42.873
We're clear! We're clear!

20:42.897 --> 20:44.904
Find out where that rocket came from.

20:48.042 --> 20:50.202
Lieutenant, you need to see this.

20:50.261 --> 20:51.940
Coming right away.

20:56.273 --> 20:57.952
Olive-drab green.

20:58.492 --> 21:00.829
And Cyrillic lettering.

21:00.923 --> 21:01.850
Russian-made.

21:01.874 --> 21:03.342
Too big to be AKs.

21:03.481 --> 21:07.672
Yes, but exactly the right
size for an RPG-7 launchers.

21:07.696 --> 21:09.011
Rocket-propelled grenades?

21:09.034 --> 21:13.543
Yes, exactly why our ship owner
didn't want help finding his boat.

21:14.267 --> 21:15.524
Here you go.

21:15.582 --> 21:17.485
You see these indentations?

21:17.672 --> 21:19.845
Looks like each one's
the size of an RPG case.

21:19.856 --> 21:22.698
Yes, and each one of them is empty.
This is where they stored them.

21:29.238 --> 21:30.413
Oh, that's just great.

21:30.495 --> 21:33.137
We've got one empty case in
here and ten full ones out there.

21:33.157 --> 21:36.375
The streets of Miami just got
a whole lot more dangerous.

21:46.115 --> 21:48.605
Alexx. What do you think?

21:49.673 --> 21:52.092
So this is what a pirate looks like?

21:51.815 --> 21:53.788
You were expecting an eye patch?

21:53.905 --> 21:55.948
Maybe a shoulder parrot.

21:55.962 --> 21:57.253
Horatio!

21:57.453 --> 21:58.451
Excuse me, Alexx.

21:58.463 --> 21:59.296
Be right back.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.388
Hang on!

22:06.406 --> 22:07.439
Find the shooter?

22:07.463 --> 22:10.034
Long gone, but he left something behind.

22:14.073 --> 22:16.915
Thought these Russian rocket
launchers were reusable.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.392
They are reusable.

22:21.428 --> 22:24.117
Why go the trouble of stealing
it, and then just leave it here?

22:24.140 --> 22:27.287
Maybe he was a first-timer and
wasn't prepared for the recoil.

22:35.586 --> 22:37.441
Look at the eyesight.

22:38.628 --> 22:41.763
These RPGs, they fire with
about 400 feet per second.

22:41.775 --> 22:43.818
That thing must've hit
him like a sledgehammer.

22:43.842 --> 22:46.730
And so what we do is we check
every emergency room in the city.

22:46.740 --> 22:51.155
Right. I'll have Homicide, have them check
all the hospitals for one-eyed admissions.

22:58.361 --> 22:59.782
Darryl Morgan.

22:59.864 --> 23:02.471
I had patrol pick him up
from Dade Memorial E.R.

23:02.494 --> 23:03.786
He gave them this...

23:03.880 --> 23:04.819
Hmm.

23:05.066 --> 23:07.696
"I will not waive my
Constitutional rights.

23:07.723 --> 23:10.379
"I will not answer any questions
"without the presence of an attorney,

23:10.414 --> 23:14.670
"and I will not consent to a
search of my person or property."

23:14.705 --> 23:18.279
Darryl, this is pre-printed. I'm
impressed. You've done this before.

23:18.312 --> 23:20.155
I've got nothing to say.

23:20.507 --> 23:24.218
That's very interesting, since we
haven't asked you any questions yet.

23:24.241 --> 23:26.507
Ask away. I know my rights.

23:26.554 --> 23:28.480
You can't even detain
me unless you arrest me.

23:28.489 --> 23:31.260
Okay, let's start with what
happened to your eye, partner?

23:31.283 --> 23:32.352
I tripped and fell.

23:32.375 --> 23:34.207
Onto a rocket launcher?

23:40.918 --> 23:43.884
We have a blood and tissue
sample from the optical sight,

23:43.919 --> 23:47.430
which we'll match to your DNA and
prove that you blew up a police car.

23:48.243 --> 23:50.603
You will be going away
for quite a long time.

23:50.627 --> 23:52.740
I have the right to bear
arms. Second Amendment.

23:52.752 --> 23:54.901
To defend your home, not launch rockets.

23:54.924 --> 23:57.531
Also says my ability to form
a militia cannot be infringed.

23:57.540 --> 23:59.160
Ooh, a militia, Darryl.

23:59.184 --> 24:01.309
You just copped to a
criminal conspiracy.

24:01.332 --> 24:03.152
Why don't you tell us
who your friends are?

24:03.176 --> 24:05.430
Why don't you learn to speak English?

24:07.629 --> 24:09.719
I suggest you respond to my question.

24:09.742 --> 24:12.548
Not giving up my friends
to some Puerto Rican cop.

24:12.560 --> 24:17.539
Darryl, that is Detective Salas, and
she is attempting to give you a chance.

24:17.560 --> 24:20.495
but you are too stupid to realize that.

24:20.507 --> 24:22.010
Please take him.

24:22.021 --> 24:23.830
You're on your own, buddy.

24:27.406 --> 24:28.451
Lieutenant Caine?

24:28.475 --> 24:29.297
Yes.

24:29.461 --> 24:32.760
I'm Wesley Morgan. I understand
you have my son, Darryl, in custody.

24:32.784 --> 24:36.518
Yes, Mr. Morgan. If this is about bail,
I don't... I don't make that decision.

24:36.541 --> 24:39.066
It's not. Actually...

24:39.267 --> 24:41.909
I think it might be better
if I didn't bail him out.

24:41.944 --> 24:43.470
Okay. Um...

24:43.881 --> 24:45.560
You know what, why don't we...
Why don't we step over here.

24:45.584 --> 24:46.641
Okay. Thank you.

24:47.697 --> 24:49.083
Darryl was a good kid.

24:49.437 --> 24:52.736
Honor student, varsity baseball team.

24:53.136 --> 24:55.273
Even worked summers on my car lot.

24:56.646 --> 24:58.208
But then something changed.

24:58.255 --> 25:00.098
He started hanging
around with a bad crowd.

25:00.120 --> 25:03.208
Mr. Morgan, your son has half
a dozen arrests to his credit.

25:03.220 --> 25:04.699
This is not about peer pressure.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.263
I know. I've tried to
get him help, but...

25:06.298 --> 25:08.642
counselling or something,
but he won't listen to me.

25:08.668 --> 25:09.642
Okay, he's going to listen now.

25:09.652 --> 25:11.455
These are very serious
charges levied against him,

25:11.490 --> 25:13.664
including blowing up a police car.

25:14.889 --> 25:16.462
Oh, my God...

25:17.190 --> 25:18.458
Well, is there anything I can do?

25:18.482 --> 25:19.609
Make restitution?

25:19.623 --> 25:22.019
Well, unfortunately, that's
not the way this works.

25:25.846 --> 25:29.287
You must wonder how I could be so blind
to what was happening right under my nose.

25:29.308 --> 25:32.525
Well, Mr. Morgan, with family...

25:33.277 --> 25:35.261
With family, all bets are off.

25:35.613 --> 25:37.844
If you really want to help
your son, here's what I suggest.

25:37.862 --> 25:39.187
Get him to talk to us,

25:39.222 --> 25:42.693
because we believe he's in possession
of some very dangerous weapons.

25:43.651 --> 25:45.835
- I'll do what I can.
- Okay.

25:46.633 --> 25:48.125
- Thank you, lieutenant.
- Yes.

25:54.146 --> 25:55.156
Hey, Valera.

25:55.180 --> 25:56.013
Hey.

25:56.342 --> 25:58.326
You get anything out
of our two castaways?

25:58.346 --> 26:01.282
Depends on how you like your data
- raw or cooked?

26:01.963 --> 26:03.196
Fine Young Cannibals?

26:03.219 --> 26:05.415
Found human DNA in the stomach contents.

26:05.427 --> 26:07.869
Spectra's a match to
our victim, Chip Manning.

26:08.912 --> 26:10.568
So they did eat their friend.

26:10.591 --> 26:11.953
One of them did.

26:13.033 --> 26:14.501
What do you want me to say?

26:14.701 --> 26:16.264
I wish I didn't have
to make that choice,

26:16.299 --> 26:18.175
but I was gonna die if
I didn't eat something.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.139
Or someone.

26:19.155 --> 26:20.857
Chip was the weak link.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.757
I'm sorry he's dead, but,
hey, better him than me.

26:23.781 --> 26:28.219
Well, the other guy in the boat managed to
survive without resorting to cannibalism.

26:28.407 --> 26:30.063
Different metabolism.

26:30.609 --> 26:34.707
I'm not proud of it, but I'm not
gonna apologize for surviving.

26:37.044 --> 26:38.124
Arrest me.

26:38.147 --> 26:39.967
Unfortunately, I can't.

26:40.071 --> 26:42.416
Desecration of a corpse
is a second-degree felony,

26:42.451 --> 26:45.347
but the State's Attorney has
decided against filing charges.

26:47.116 --> 26:48.607
So I'm free to go?

26:49.065 --> 26:50.087
For now.

26:57.893 --> 27:00.512
"For now?" What am I missing?

27:01.633 --> 27:03.946
He said "different metabolisms."

27:03.958 --> 27:05.848
It's a valid reason why Brian survived.

27:05.872 --> 27:07.351
I wasn't thinking about Brian.

27:07.363 --> 27:11.743
Chip had sunken eyes, he had blue lips,
all of the classic signs of dehydration.

27:11.761 --> 27:14.179
but he was far worse than the other two.

27:14.203 --> 27:16.246
There's metabolism
and there's metabolism.

27:16.270 --> 27:18.207
You're thinking somebody
helped Chip along?

27:18.219 --> 27:19.898
There's only one way to find out.

27:20.262 --> 27:21.565
I'll go back to the body.

27:21.574 --> 27:22.631
Okay. I'll be in Trace.

27:22.654 --> 27:23.805
Will you find me?

27:25.662 --> 27:28.010
You want to test for electrolytes?

27:28.044 --> 27:28.737
Yeah.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.486
Specifically salt content.

27:30.817 --> 27:34.633
Well, it's not part
of a typical tox panel.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.688
I'll have to draw more fluid.

27:36.723 --> 27:39.001
I'll wait, walk the
blood back to the lab.

27:39.037 --> 27:40.140
Not blood.

27:41.174 --> 27:42.571
Ocular fluid.

27:42.947 --> 27:43.804
Oh.

27:46.940 --> 27:48.419
Still want to wait?

27:48.889 --> 27:49.758
S
- Sure.

27:55.406 --> 27:56.051
Yes, Frank?

27:56.063 --> 27:57.061
I just got a call out.

27:57.082 --> 27:58.726
Someone fired another of those rockets

27:58.750 --> 27:59.971
An RPG attack? Where are you?

27:59.994 --> 28:01.380
Little tienda on Calle Ocho.

28:01.392 --> 28:02.507
I'm on my way.

28:12.508 --> 28:13.537
Frank.

28:13.572 --> 28:14.704
Injuries?

28:15.584 --> 28:17.757
Owner's alive. Roberto Lopez.

28:18.014 --> 28:18.991
Second-degree burns.

28:18.992 --> 28:20.124
Did he see the shooter?

28:20.159 --> 28:22.278
'Fraid we're gonna need
a translator for that.

28:22.279 --> 28:23.273
Señor Lopez.

28:24.072 --> 28:26.649
No lo ví. Estaba trabajando.

28:26.650 --> 28:28.304
That's okay. We're gonna find him.

28:28.988 --> 28:30.415
Señor Lopez, ¿como esta?

28:30.416 --> 28:33.588
Mi vida. Lo perdí todo.

28:33.623 --> 28:36.006
Okay. We're gonna make it right.

28:38.119 --> 28:38.770
H.

28:38.771 --> 28:39.241
Yeah.

28:42.772 --> 28:43.964
Ooh, that's interesting.

28:43.965 --> 28:45.142
Roundy-round?

28:47.481 --> 28:48.426
Excuse me, sir?

28:49.422 --> 28:50.886
Sir, with the sunglasses?

28:50.887 --> 28:51.995
Excuse me, sir.

28:51.996 --> 28:52.464
Sir.

28:53.877 --> 28:55.067
He's talking to you.

28:55.368 --> 28:56.394
Get away from me!

28:56.395 --> 28:57.459
Easy.

28:59.668 --> 29:02.340
Ooh, that's a familiar
looking shiner, isn't it, Eric?

29:05.061 --> 29:06.830
And this is familiar, too.

29:07.273 --> 29:10.435
You and Darryl Morgan commit a little
ethnic cleansing down here, friend?

29:11.191 --> 29:13.450
Somebody's got to look
out for regular Americans.

29:13.451 --> 29:15.329
"Regular Americans."

29:15.789 --> 29:18.694
Nice tattoo. Merchant marine?

29:19.705 --> 29:20.615
Now, I know that Darryl...

29:20.650 --> 29:23.516
couldn't pirate that ship on
his own, so you helped him.

29:42.663 --> 29:44.633
And now that Darryl's
in jail, who helped you?

29:45.524 --> 29:46.782
I've got nothing to say.

29:46.783 --> 29:48.559
That's familiar, too, and you know what?

29:48.594 --> 29:49.938
That's going to change.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.852
How's the store owner doing, Mr. Lopez?

29:56.853 --> 29:57.606
How should I know?

29:57.607 --> 30:00.011
All I got was a bunch of
Spanglish and "no me gusta"s.

30:00.012 --> 30:01.047
Give it a rest, Frank.

30:01.048 --> 30:03.984
What? The guy's probably been here 30
years and doesn't bother to learn English?

30:03.985 --> 30:05.303
Yeah, well, how's your Spanish?

30:05.604 --> 30:06.304
Rusty.

30:07.074 --> 30:09.850
Some days I can't tell if I'm
in South Florida or North Cuba.

30:09.885 --> 30:12.931
Yeah. Guy lost his business
and nearly got killed.

30:12.966 --> 30:15.977
I got as much sympathy for
Mr. Lopez as the next guy.

30:16.012 --> 30:18.355
I'm just saying if he tried to fit
in a little bit, it wouldn't hurt.

30:18.390 --> 30:19.716
You're blaming the victim, Frank.

30:19.751 --> 30:20.673
No, I'm not, Delko.

30:20.708 --> 30:21.561
I'm just saying...

30:21.596 --> 30:22.678
Gentlemen, gentlemen...

30:23.348 --> 30:25.585
conduct unbecoming. We're
in a public space here.

30:25.620 --> 30:27.253
Now, Frank, what about witnesses?

30:28.156 --> 30:30.200
Car slowed down. The
shooter was in the back seat.

30:30.235 --> 30:32.244
Okay, so we have a driver
and a shooter. What else?

30:32.663 --> 30:34.705
RPG was launched from over here.

30:35.761 --> 30:36.944
Looks like auto glass.

30:37.353 --> 30:38.809
Yes, it does.

30:42.518 --> 30:44.633
So the glass shattered when
the rocket fired, right?

30:46.250 --> 30:49.028
Propulsion from those grenades
burns at over a thousand degrees.

30:49.063 --> 30:50.682
It vents out a breech in the back.

30:54.069 --> 30:56.211
Seems to be some kind of
paper attached to this.

30:56.246 --> 30:58.241
How can paper get
seared into window glass?

30:58.276 --> 30:59.910
I don't know, but Q.D. will.

31:01.146 --> 31:01.890
Eric...

31:05.435 --> 31:06.478
- Hey
- Hey

31:06.917 --> 31:07.953
XRD scan.

31:08.345 --> 31:10.241
Levels of sodium and
chlorine are off the chart.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.085
Chip died of dehydration.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.270
Caused by a massive salt overdose.

31:14.305 --> 31:16.834
Blood cells get depleted
trying to handle the overload...

31:23.482 --> 31:26.396
Kidneys can't process the excess
salt. Eventually, they shut down.

31:26.849 --> 31:28.688
Chip died from drinking seawater.

31:29.570 --> 31:33.117
Question is, did he drink it
himself, or did he have help?

31:36.907 --> 31:37.586
What's this?

31:38.239 --> 31:40.124
Evidence that you killed Chip Manning.

31:41.111 --> 31:41.904
How do you figure?

31:41.939 --> 31:45.312
That's his blood on the rim of that
cup, and your print is on the outside.

31:45.347 --> 31:47.516
We went back and
re-examined the life raft.

31:48.793 --> 31:50.642
He was dying, but you helped him out

31:50.974 --> 31:52.394
forced him to drink seawater.

31:58.803 --> 32:00.621
I bailed out the raft with that cup.

32:00.656 --> 32:02.404
If Chip drank from it, I didn't see it.

32:02.439 --> 32:04.170
You see, Adam, we don't
just consider evidence.

32:04.205 --> 32:05.833
We also consider character.

32:06.396 --> 32:08.073
Yours has been suspicious
from the get-go.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.199
Well, too bad you can't
take character to court.

32:12.950 --> 32:14.446
You're the only eyewitness we have.

32:14.968 --> 32:16.338
Anyway you gotta believe me,

32:16.651 --> 32:18.341
I didn't see Adam do anything to Chip.

32:18.376 --> 32:20.479
Brian, how can you
expect me to believe you?

32:20.514 --> 32:22.619
There were three of you on a teeny raft.

32:24.782 --> 32:26.462
I thought Chip was your friend.

32:26.497 --> 32:27.977
Yeah, well, Adam's still my friend.

32:28.012 --> 32:29.457
Is that why you're protecting him?

32:29.492 --> 32:30.962
You don't understand.

32:31.855 --> 32:33.380
Adam saved my life.

32:33.861 --> 32:35.289
He got us off that fishing boat.

32:35.324 --> 32:38.646
It was so dark out there, I couldn't
see my own hand in front of my face.

32:39.052 --> 32:39.844
Wait a minute.

32:42.482 --> 32:43.757
Adam didn't have a flashlight?

32:44.331 --> 32:45.373
I don't think so. Why?

32:45.973 --> 32:47.263
Middle of the night...

32:48.416 --> 32:49.256
middle of the ocean.

32:50.292 --> 32:50.989
Where you going?

32:52.047 --> 32:53.857
I think Adam's been
telling us a fish tale.

32:55.134 --> 32:56.786
Look, you can't prove I killed Chip.

32:57.005 --> 32:57.568
You're right.

32:58.145 --> 32:58.798
Then I'm outta here.

32:58.833 --> 33:01.638
We can prove, however, that
you helped to kill these men.

33:10.401 --> 33:11.255
You're under arrest, Adam.

33:11.551 --> 33:12.077
For what?

33:12.387 --> 33:13.856
Conspiracy to commit murder.

33:14.067 --> 33:15.538
It's the same as if you
drowned them yourself.

33:15.638 --> 33:16.924
Yeah, I don't know
what're you talking about.

33:17.024 --> 33:18.793
You told me you saw a boat, right?

33:19.408 --> 33:21.099
You saw men with guns
approaching the Eileen.

33:21.134 --> 33:22.110
That's right.

33:23.237 --> 33:24.383
Here's the problem:

33:24.920 --> 33:26.322
Six nights ago there was a new moon.

33:26.357 --> 33:28.557
Means about.01 foot-candles
of illumination.

33:28.592 --> 33:30.323
That is practically pitch black.

33:30.358 --> 33:32.478
There is no way you could've
seen the pirates coming.

33:32.578 --> 33:34.049
You had to have known ahead of time.

33:34.433 --> 33:36.371
No, that's not true.

33:36.406 --> 33:38.971
Homicide ran your bank account
at Biscayne Mutual Trust.

33:39.006 --> 33:40.128
Took them a while to find it.

33:40.358 --> 33:43.144
Deposit six days ago for $5,000.

33:43.502 --> 33:45.213
Big bucks for a starving student.

33:52.427 --> 33:54.612
I didn't know they were
gonna kill anyone, I swear.

33:56.464 --> 33:58.157
All I had to do was
call in our position.

33:59.335 --> 34:00.015
Who gave you the money?

34:01.074 --> 34:01.719
Was it this man?

34:03.901 --> 34:05.735
No. An older guy.

34:07.123 --> 34:07.884
What about him?

34:07.919 --> 34:11.012
We just picked him up for firing a
RPG rocket on a convenience store.

34:12.293 --> 34:12.659
No.

34:13.621 --> 34:15.040
That's not the guy who paid me off.

34:16.208 --> 34:17.411
I've never seen him before.

34:29.033 --> 34:31.375
Hey, find out what stuck
the paper to the car glass?

34:32.248 --> 34:33.717
Yeah. The carmaker.

34:34.685 --> 34:35.952
You want to explain that?

34:36.471 --> 34:37.445
Maybe this'll help.

34:42.348 --> 34:44.851
It's a partial Vehicle
Identification Number.

34:44.886 --> 34:45.946
It's a Buyers Guide.

34:45.981 --> 34:48.246
FTC requires them on all used cars.

34:48.482 --> 34:50.610
That's right. The dealers
slap them on the window.

34:50.876 --> 34:52.094
Got the first three digits,

34:52.646 --> 34:53.775
but that's all. Sorry.

34:53.904 --> 34:54.522
No.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.651
No, don't be sorry. That
might be all we need.

34:58.113 --> 34:59.342
Your turn to explain.

35:00.494 --> 35:03.594
Well every VIN number has 16 digits.

35:03.629 --> 35:05.871
Each one means something different.

35:05.906 --> 35:08.113
The first, uh, first one's a "one."

35:08.148 --> 35:10.256
That means the car was made in the USA.

35:10.291 --> 35:11.901
Second digit's an "F."

35:15.477 --> 35:16.664
Means that it's a Ford.

35:18.048 --> 35:18.938
And that helps?

35:19.864 --> 35:23.253
Yeah, well, it does when your suspect's
dad owns a used car dealership.

35:25.132 --> 35:27.333
This is a family car, an SUV...

35:34.625 --> 35:35.403
Excuse me.

35:36.199 --> 35:38.973
Lieutenant, what's going on?

35:39.008 --> 35:40.411
If you have any more
questions about my son, I'd...

35:40.446 --> 35:41.793
This is not about your son.

35:44.599 --> 35:45.401
A search warrant?

35:46.399 --> 35:46.858
For what?

35:46.893 --> 35:48.517
For every car on this lot.

36:39.208 --> 36:39.896
Hey, H?

36:40.649 --> 36:41.502
Did you get something?

36:41.537 --> 36:43.911
Yeah, not quite the new car smell.

36:44.838 --> 36:46.924
Got nitroglycerin on
the roof and carpet.

36:46.959 --> 36:47.993
Nothing on the door.

36:48.028 --> 36:49.609
Could have been replaced.

36:50.413 --> 36:52.144
Let's go deal with our dealer, okay?

36:53.237 --> 36:55.310
Someone stole the car
and took it for a joyride.

36:55.973 --> 36:57.724
Door was damaged, so I swapped it out.

36:58.552 --> 37:01.588
That car was used in a
rocket attack on Calle Ocho.

37:01.688 --> 37:05.514
Discharge probably blew out
the car's rear passenger window.

37:05.549 --> 37:09.341
Look, I pay my taxes, I'm
cooperating with your investigation.

37:09.441 --> 37:10.635
Now, do your job.

37:10.670 --> 37:11.460
That's what we're doing.

37:11.495 --> 37:15.261
I'm confused as to how somebody broke
into your lot here with all your security.

37:15.461 --> 37:17.074
That's the way this neighbourhood is now.

37:17.109 --> 37:19.391
Times was, we didn't have
to lock our doors at night.

37:19.426 --> 37:21.341
Now, property values are in the toilet,

37:22.298 --> 37:23.672
bad influences moving in.

37:24.415 --> 37:25.083
You know, Wesley,

37:25.118 --> 37:27.956
the only bad influence in
this neighbourhood is you.

37:29.124 --> 37:32.739
Fine. You think I shot some kind
of a rocket at old Fidel's store?

37:33.700 --> 37:34.453
Prove it.

37:34.488 --> 37:35.206
Eric?

37:40.814 --> 37:41.462
What is that?

37:42.249 --> 37:43.385
This is only gonna hurt a little bit.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.149
Thanks for your cooperation.

38:40.636 --> 38:43.117
I'm going to be filing a
complaint with your supervisor.

38:45.782 --> 38:46.920
Why don't you do that, Wesley?

38:47.503 --> 38:49.959
And in the meantime, I'm gonna
file some paperwork on you.

38:49.994 --> 38:53.064
Yeah. Like for arms dealing
and attempted murder.

38:53.099 --> 38:54.661
What? That's ridiculous.

38:55.144 --> 38:56.551
Nasal swab say otherwise.

38:57.390 --> 39:01.783
Found traces of nitroglycerin
and sulfur in your nasal passage.

39:01.818 --> 39:05.250
And that's consistent with
the exhaust from an RPG-7.

39:05.285 --> 39:08.683
The friend of yours that
we picked up at the tienda

39:08.718 --> 39:11.486
fired that rocket from your car.

39:26.079 --> 39:28.342
You, my friend, just
went from selling cars...

39:28.377 --> 39:30.273
to making license plates.

39:35.579 --> 39:37.354
I walked out my front
door the other day.

39:39.426 --> 39:41.738
I didn't hear a word of
English for six blocks.

39:42.495 --> 39:44.263
Just Cuban music playing in the stores.

39:45.031 --> 39:46.721
When did Miami become a foreign country?

39:46.756 --> 39:48.621
This is America, Wesley,

39:48.656 --> 39:51.682
and all of your grenade launchers
are not gonna change that.

39:51.782 --> 39:53.423
These people.

39:53.684 --> 39:55.781
They sneak into our cities on rafts.

39:56.820 --> 39:57.582
They bring poverty

39:57.617 --> 39:59.856
and crime and disease
to our neighbourhoods.

39:59.891 --> 40:01.206
They don't belong here.

40:01.241 --> 40:06.226
These people have just as much
right to be here as you do.

40:08.316 --> 40:10.685
I admire your conviction,
defending your race.

40:11.545 --> 40:13.120
What I'm trying to do is no different.

40:13.155 --> 40:14.503
Well, here's one difference.

40:14.538 --> 40:16.398
You're going to jail.

40:17.254 --> 40:19.167
Well, you can lock me up,

40:20.017 --> 40:21.402
but you can't stop the Movement.

40:22.923 --> 40:23.917
We go to work with you.

40:24.820 --> 40:26.557
Our kids go to school with your kids.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.559
Hell, we might even
live right next door.

40:29.750 --> 40:30.933
How are you gonna stop us all?

40:32.373 --> 40:35.230
One animal at a time.

40:35.831 --> 40:37.985
We'll start by
confiscating your computers.

40:38.751 --> 40:40.490
Hunting down your E-mail contacts.

40:41.338 --> 40:43.250
And then track your
credit card purchases,

40:43.285 --> 40:44.776
club memberships,

40:44.811 --> 40:46.652
hell, magazine subscriptions.

40:48.192 --> 40:51.568
Everything we need to do until
all of you are rooted out.

40:54.081 --> 40:56.370
Because we never close.

40:57.179 --> 40:57.989
Ever

42:16.933 --> 42:17.582
You got it?

42:17.982 --> 42:19.302
It's kind of heavy...

42:19.337 --> 42:20.017
It's all right.

42:29.073 --> 42:29.867
Listo (ready)

42:29.902 --> 42:30.905
Listo si (ready yes)

42:33.147 --> 42:33.980
Here we go.

42:35.723 --> 42:36.570
Gracias.

43:07.915 --> 43:08.719
Señor.

43:09.575 --> 43:10.385
Mira (look)
