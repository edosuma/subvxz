02:03.432 --> 02:04.766
Who's there?

02:11.941 --> 02:13.775
No!

02:21.417 --> 02:24.519
No!

02:29.524 --> 02:31.826
Hey. You okay?

02:33.929 --> 02:35.197
What was it this time?

03:01.323 --> 03:02.690
Hey.

03:03.658 --> 03:05.827
- Breakfast?
- No, I'm good.

03:07.897 --> 03:09.631
Suit yourself.

03:11.467 --> 03:12.968
But I know a guy,

03:13.102 --> 03:15.670
fries up a mean omelet.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.672
I'm good.

03:18.507 --> 03:19.607
Tell you what?

03:20.309 --> 03:21.949
I'm going to cook up
some of your favorite

03:21.977 --> 03:23.913
blueberry pancakes just to...

03:37.927 --> 03:39.462
Hmm.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.864
- What? Oh. Oh, sorry.
- Yeah.

03:42.998 --> 03:44.318
No, no, no,
I'll take the... yeah.

03:44.666 --> 03:46.710
- See, that's why I don't do...
- I need to teach you.

03:46.734 --> 03:47.734
- Laundry. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

03:47.836 --> 03:48.837
Domesticate me.

03:48.971 --> 03:50.973
Yeah.

03:51.907 --> 03:54.577
Hey, I was thinking we'd take
a drive down the coast,

03:55.277 --> 03:57.113
get out of the city for a bit.

03:57.246 --> 03:58.380
What do you think?

04:06.489 --> 04:07.856
I must have missed one.

04:09.325 --> 04:10.859
Sorry.

04:19.268 --> 04:21.769
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, no heavy lifting.

04:22.404 --> 04:23.671
No heavy lifting.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.085
They're just
some clothes, Danny.

04:25.207 --> 04:26.375
Doctor's orders.

04:28.210 --> 04:29.278
Thank you.

04:34.383 --> 04:36.085
<i>Marie Sullivan?</i>

04:37.019 --> 04:39.021
- Yes?
- <i>Let's see...</i>

04:39.555 --> 04:42.958
<i>Follow-up surgery seems to be
keeping the sepsis in check.</i>

04:43.893 --> 04:45.427
<i>Good. Think that should be all.</i>

04:45.561 --> 04:46.996
Uh, the pain?

04:47.429 --> 04:48.663
<i>How much pain?</i>

04:48.796 --> 04:50.665
It comes and goes,
but when I move

04:50.798 --> 04:52.834
in a certain way, it's a six.

04:53.569 --> 04:55.837
<i>I'll send something
to the pharmacy on file.</i>

04:55.971 --> 04:58.340
Can... can you talk
about treatment options?

05:02.011 --> 05:03.778
<i>I know this is hard.</i>

05:04.746 --> 05:06.115
<i>But even ivf</i>

05:06.248 --> 05:08.951
<i>has no real
probability of success.</i>

05:09.084 --> 05:11.786
- Can we do something?
- <i>The damage was extensive.</i>

05:11.921 --> 05:16.058
<i>I'd focus on recovery and
forget any... distractions.</i>

05:16.625 --> 05:18.760
- But doct...
- <i>Yes?</i>

05:36.844 --> 05:38.380
Want to talk about it?

05:39.648 --> 05:41.083
Talk about what?

05:43.352 --> 05:44.620
Anything.

05:45.321 --> 05:47.890
The doctor said I should
focus on getting healthy

05:48.023 --> 05:49.857
and forget about anything else.

05:51.026 --> 05:52.328
Is that so bad?

05:55.763 --> 05:57.032
So bad?

06:01.403 --> 06:02.938
You can still have kids,

06:03.072 --> 06:05.174
so I guess it's not
so bad for you, is it?

06:08.911 --> 06:10.346
Who am I having kids with?

06:11.413 --> 06:12.514
Someone else.

06:15.451 --> 06:16.518
Wait. Stop.

06:17.052 --> 06:19.121
I'm sorry. Stop.

06:21.724 --> 06:22.992
I'm sorry.

06:32.334 --> 06:33.369
I j...

06:33.969 --> 06:35.471
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

06:38.607 --> 06:39.874
Come here.

06:43.545 --> 06:44.846
We're going to live.

06:45.847 --> 06:47.116
Okay?

06:49.285 --> 06:50.386
Come here.

06:53.656 --> 06:55.324
Just live, okay?

07:18.213 --> 07:20.349
- You know what I was thinking?
- What's up?

07:21.684 --> 07:24.653
I think that trip down
the coast sounds pretty nice.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.657
- What?
- Uh...

07:28.791 --> 07:30.825
Nothing to worry about. Um...

07:34.997 --> 07:37.132
It's from the hospital.

07:38.767 --> 07:40.569
Twenty-six thousand dollars?

07:41.236 --> 07:43.372
They want us to keep paying them

07:43.505 --> 07:45.074
for what they did to me?

07:47.676 --> 07:50.512
Look, i'm... I'm sure we can
negotiate it down, it's just...

07:51.880 --> 07:53.549
We just got to
call up the lawyer and...

07:53.682 --> 07:55.551
Goddammit.

08:58.347 --> 08:59.415
Hey.

09:01.150 --> 09:02.684
I'll be right back. Okay?

09:03.252 --> 09:04.520
Just wait right here.

09:22.704 --> 09:24.640
All right. Okay, come on.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.476
- What's that?
- Nothing.

09:27.609 --> 09:30.045
Are you gonna
tell me what that is?

09:32.181 --> 09:34.316
So, I was doing
some research online

09:34.450 --> 09:37.686
and I came across
this herbal remedy.

09:38.187 --> 09:40.456
Figured we'd try
the holistic approach?

09:42.558 --> 09:44.193
This is where we're at now?

09:44.326 --> 09:47.162
Three rounds of ivf,
second opinions,

09:47.296 --> 09:49.598
third opinions,
fourth opinions, yeah.

09:50.466 --> 09:52.434
This is where we're at.

09:55.337 --> 09:56.614
- What...
- You're supposed to take it

09:56.638 --> 09:57.706
with food.

10:00.275 --> 10:02.177
I thought you said
you wanted to give up.

10:03.712 --> 10:05.514
I'm in it as long as you are.

10:40.582 --> 10:42.952
Hey, are you okay?

10:43.585 --> 10:45.587
- What happened?
- I ate a little bit.

10:45.721 --> 10:47.289
Did you take it with food?

10:53.795 --> 10:55.664
Drink up. Here.

10:58.166 --> 11:00.235
I am so,

11:00.369 --> 11:02.838
so sorry, that was stupid.

11:02.972 --> 11:04.773
Don't apologize.

11:05.607 --> 11:06.675
Okay?

11:07.911 --> 11:09.378
We're done with all this.

11:10.145 --> 11:11.413
Done.

11:16.184 --> 11:17.753
Just give me a minute, okay?

11:18.787 --> 11:20.055
Okay.

11:20.856 --> 11:21.958
Yeah, I'll go, um...

11:22.391 --> 11:23.911
I'll just take care
of some work, then.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.227

13:02.224 --> 13:03.859
Hey, Marie.

13:04.760 --> 13:05.827
Marie.

13:10.599 --> 13:11.867
No.

13:12.001 --> 13:13.268
I said I'm done.

13:14.202 --> 13:16.005
I mean it. Okay?

13:16.139 --> 13:17.205
You were right.

13:17.673 --> 13:20.275
The doctors were right,
everybody was right.

13:21.376 --> 13:22.879
Let's, um...

13:23.012 --> 13:26.181
Let's put this
all behind us and move on.

13:27.616 --> 13:29.518
Sure you don't want
to hear 'em out?

13:49.471 --> 13:52.141
One free vacation
courtesy of Dr. Lands

13:52.274 --> 13:53.875
coming right up.

13:57.146 --> 13:58.413
The other one.

14:01.650 --> 14:03.128
Oh, come on,
I thought you'd be getting

14:03.152 --> 14:04.386
a little excited by now.

14:04.519 --> 14:06.421
I don't want
to get my hopes up, okay?

14:07.656 --> 14:08.857
Don't be afraid of hope.

14:08.991 --> 14:10.459
It's what keeps us.

14:10.592 --> 14:12.594
Even if it's all bullshit?

14:13.628 --> 14:17.133
Marie, you need to cut out
this negativity, okay?

14:17.265 --> 14:19.068
If this has any chance
of working out,

14:19.202 --> 14:20.411
we're gonna have
to put every ounce

14:20.435 --> 14:21.703
of ourselves into it.

14:22.905 --> 14:23.973
You don't get it.

14:24.974 --> 14:26.209
It's all on me.

14:26.341 --> 14:29.011
The doctors,
the checkups, the drugs.

14:30.012 --> 14:31.413
It's all on me.

14:32.814 --> 14:34.459
Marie, you haven't thought
that this could have been

14:34.483 --> 14:35.885
really hard on me, too?

14:38.121 --> 14:40.056
Look, I wish I could
tell you not to worry,

14:40.189 --> 14:42.324
I wish I could tell you
everything's gonna be okay,

14:42.457 --> 14:44.994
but I can't
because I don't know.

14:46.595 --> 14:47.863
All I can do

14:48.363 --> 14:50.832
is promise
you aren't in this alone.

14:52.768 --> 14:53.768
Okay?

14:53.869 --> 14:56.338
- Together, right?
- Right.

14:59.374 --> 15:00.809
Go ahead. I'll take your bags.

15:02.979 --> 15:04.046
Cheer up.

15:04.881 --> 15:05.982
Come on.

15:06.581 --> 15:08.717
- All right.
- After you.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.896
We wanted
to get out of town, right?

15:20.328 --> 15:21.596
Right.

15:22.664 --> 15:24.499
Don't worry,
it'll be here when we get back.

15:25.367 --> 15:26.367
Come on.

15:35.410 --> 15:38.346
We have snacks and juices,
so feel free to help yourself.

15:41.316 --> 15:42.584
Um, how long is the drive?

15:43.920 --> 15:46.055
A few hours,
but we'll get there in a flash.

15:46.189 --> 15:47.656
Just sit back and relax.

16:00.836 --> 16:02.071
Want one?

16:03.172 --> 16:04.172
- One?
- No.

16:04.273 --> 16:05.540
Oh, come on, try one.

16:06.842 --> 16:09.344
Come on. Try one.
They're really good.

16:15.617 --> 16:18.087
Don't like it?
Here, I'll eat it.

16:18.988 --> 16:20.355
Hmm.

16:49.018 --> 16:51.486
Where we goin'?
We ain't in Brooklyn anymore.

16:51.988 --> 16:53.022
Yeah.

16:53.655 --> 16:56.391
It's literally
in the middle of nowhere.

16:56.524 --> 16:58.928
You'd have to drive back an hour

16:59.061 --> 17:00.795
just to get to nowhere.

17:06.035 --> 17:08.536
Great, the place 5g forgot.

17:08.670 --> 17:10.605
Yeah, you'd think
it'd be centrally located

17:10.739 --> 17:12.008
for all the fancy people.

17:12.141 --> 17:13.376
Well...

17:13.508 --> 17:16.845
It is the middle of nowhere.

17:18.014 --> 17:20.016
Yeah, the doc believes
in the health properties

17:20.149 --> 17:21.516
of the great outdoors.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.688
Welcome to your new home.

17:44.572 --> 17:45.607
Yeah.

17:47.475 --> 17:49.912
Wow! Smell that fresh air?

17:50.046 --> 17:51.147
It's nice.

17:51.646 --> 17:54.016
- Hey, I'm rootin' for you guys.
- Thank you.

17:54.150 --> 17:55.583
Hey, listen, I, uh...

17:56.919 --> 17:58.154
Um...

17:58.853 --> 18:00.122
Take care of yourself.

18:22.844 --> 18:24.813
- Welcome.
- Hi.

18:24.947 --> 18:26.215
Hi.

18:26.349 --> 18:27.615
Careful, they're heavy.

18:29.285 --> 18:30.552
Okay.

18:35.291 --> 18:36.558
Right this way.

18:48.703 --> 18:50.306
All these babies,

18:50.439 --> 18:51.941
these families...

18:52.640 --> 18:54.143
They're from here?

18:54.609 --> 18:56.544
These are just the recent ones.

19:06.455 --> 19:08.357
Right this way.

19:17.900 --> 19:20.403
- For your use on campus.
- Oh?

19:21.237 --> 19:23.439
We wear these,
not normal clothes?

19:24.373 --> 19:26.475
The lands institute
for reproductive sciences

19:26.608 --> 19:27.943
is more than just a clinic.

19:28.077 --> 19:29.879
It is a world-class
research center,

19:30.012 --> 19:32.014
wildlife sanctuary
and holistic retreat

19:32.148 --> 19:33.983
to nurture the body and mind.

19:35.051 --> 19:37.685
Okay, I didn't see
any medical equipment.

19:37.819 --> 19:39.221
A lab is downstairs

19:39.355 --> 19:41.057
and there are
additional facilities nearby.

19:41.190 --> 19:42.324
Okay.

19:42.458 --> 19:43.959
And when does treatment begin?

19:44.093 --> 19:46.228
The doctor will explain
all the details himself.

19:46.362 --> 19:48.097
Okay, thank you.

19:54.136 --> 19:55.703
It's almost like
a vacation, huh?

19:55.837 --> 19:57.373
Yeah, maybe for you.

19:57.772 --> 19:59.375
Did you see all those pictures?

19:59.909 --> 20:01.477
If anyone can help us, he can.

20:01.977 --> 20:03.946
- If this doesn't work...
- It will...

20:04.080 --> 20:07.016
- You should find another part...
- Oh, my god, stop that.

20:07.149 --> 20:08.850
And if it doesn't work, so what?

20:08.984 --> 20:10.019
We can always adopt.

20:10.152 --> 20:12.720
- You sure?
- Yes, of course.

20:12.854 --> 20:15.391
Babe, there are
a million beautiful babies

20:15.524 --> 20:17.259
just waiting to be taken.

20:18.860 --> 20:19.995
That didn't sound right.

20:20.463 --> 20:22.431
What I meant to say was
there are so many kids

20:22.565 --> 20:23.865
out there
who need a loving home.

20:23.999 --> 20:25.733
And we can give it to them.

20:27.570 --> 20:28.670
'Kay.

20:28.803 --> 20:30.272
We're in this together, right?

20:32.341 --> 20:34.276
Now, can we please
have some fun?

20:34.410 --> 20:35.478
Yes.

20:36.145 --> 20:38.080
Try this on.

20:41.150 --> 20:42.284
Fancy.

21:11.380 --> 21:13.115
Who's there?

21:50.986 --> 21:52.955
<i>Dinner is served.</i>

21:58.793 --> 22:00.629
<i>Dinner is served.</i>

22:03.165 --> 22:04.766
Can't believe we fell asleep.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.101
No...

22:06.235 --> 22:07.970
I hope the food's not too weird.

22:08.103 --> 22:09.804
Alfalfa sprouts and all that.

22:10.606 --> 22:12.374
You remember the slop
those hippies fed us

22:12.508 --> 22:13.676
at that music festival?

22:30.993 --> 22:32.294
Hello, everyone.

22:33.828 --> 22:35.531
Oh, these must be
the new guests.

22:35.664 --> 22:39.101
Steve Williams.
And this is my wife, my life...

22:39.235 --> 22:41.670
- My paycheck.
- Oh, Mel.

22:42.204 --> 22:44.004
Don't embarrass me
in front of the new guests.

22:44.106 --> 22:46.175
Oh, I didn't realize
you felt shame, dear.

22:46.308 --> 22:48.244
- Um, I'm Danny.
- I'm Marie.

22:48.377 --> 22:50.212
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

22:50.346 --> 22:52.348
Oh, and these are... oh, well,

22:52.481 --> 22:54.416
I suspect
they might get offended

22:54.550 --> 22:57.819
if I, as a man,
dare introduce them, so...

22:57.953 --> 22:59.088
Steve, don't be obnoxious.

22:59.221 --> 23:01.123
I'm Izzy. And this is blu.

23:01.257 --> 23:02.324
Hey, guys.

23:02.857 --> 23:04.093
- Hi.
- It's really great.

23:04.226 --> 23:05.427
- Welcome.
- To meet you guys.

23:05.561 --> 23:06.561
Mm-hmm. Good to meet

23:06.662 --> 23:07.930
you, too. Here.

23:10.599 --> 23:12.034
So...

23:12.867 --> 23:14.336
Welcome to paradise.

23:14.470 --> 23:15.638
Paradise?

23:16.138 --> 23:19.508
Yeah. I mean, everyone's been
tested for everything.

23:19.642 --> 23:21.143
There's healthy food

23:21.277 --> 23:23.212
and the freshest air
in the northeast.

23:23.345 --> 23:26.115
I mean, if this isn't heaven,
I don't know what is.

23:26.248 --> 23:28.217
It's like being in rehab.

23:28.350 --> 23:30.852
You'd know about that,
right, Steve?

23:31.253 --> 23:33.322
But I don't care
about the appointments.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.190
We're here for results.

23:36.292 --> 23:38.826
My lovely
golden toilet is far superior

23:38.961 --> 23:41.730
to the common porcelain
I find here.

23:41.863 --> 23:44.166
- Ah-ha...
- Ooh, well, I am famished.

23:44.300 --> 23:47.403
This is quite
the, uh, interesting spread.

23:47.536 --> 23:50.339
Yeah, where... where did you
get the stuff from?

23:50.472 --> 23:51.473
It's all grown

23:51.607 --> 23:53.175
on the private farm
and greenhouses.

23:53.309 --> 23:55.843
I thought it looked
weird, too, but...

23:56.811 --> 23:58.981
It's yummy. Try something.

23:59.948 --> 24:01.216
Okay.

24:04.586 --> 24:05.888
It's not bad.

24:06.722 --> 24:07.956
I'm game.

24:08.090 --> 24:09.725
The doctor designed
the whole process

24:09.857 --> 24:11.193
to supercharge the body

24:11.327 --> 24:12.795
and shed the world's
everyday toxins.

24:12.928 --> 24:14.596
The doctor? What's he like?

24:14.730 --> 24:16.265
Oh, he's wonderful.

24:16.398 --> 24:19.568
He's so caring, so brilliant.

24:19.702 --> 24:21.170
A bit of a control freak,

24:21.303 --> 24:23.405
but I suppose
you must respect the intellect.

24:23.539 --> 24:25.441
He speaks
five different languages, dear.

24:25.574 --> 24:27.710
- Who doesn't?
- Don't worry about anything.

24:27.842 --> 24:29.445
I'm sure you'll be fine, too.

24:29.578 --> 24:31.680
She's just upset
that at her advanced age,

24:31.814 --> 24:33.282
fertility is an uphill battle.

24:33.415 --> 24:36.685
I'm sure you two bitches
are cozy as clams

24:36.819 --> 24:39.788
with god knows what
designer sperm he's sold you.

24:39.922 --> 24:41.924
Don't be crass, dear.

24:42.057 --> 24:43.459
I'll be what I damn well please.

24:43.592 --> 24:44.993
Now go fetch me a drink.

24:45.127 --> 24:47.629
So, you're here
for artificial insemination?

24:47.763 --> 24:50.165
Mm, kind of. It's...

24:50.299 --> 24:52.568
A boring medical procedure.

24:52.701 --> 24:54.603
Nothing to discuss
at the dinner table.

25:05.714 --> 25:07.082
Welcome.

25:07.850 --> 25:09.218
Let go of all your
fear and doubt.

25:09.351 --> 25:11.653
You're exactly
where you need to be.

25:13.522 --> 25:15.991
Oh.

25:17.226 --> 25:19.361
Dr. Lands, it is an honor

25:19.495 --> 25:20.963
to, uh... to be here, thank you.

25:21.096 --> 25:22.798
Yes, thank you for accepting us.

25:22.931 --> 25:24.266
Oh, please, it's my purpose.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.935
Everyone,
please welcome the new guests.

25:27.069 --> 25:30.906
- <i>Willkommen.</i>
- Welcome, guys.

25:31.673 --> 25:33.208
It's gonna be a trip!

25:33.342 --> 25:36.412
Mm, we do so love fresh meat
around here, do we not?

25:36.545 --> 25:38.414
Well, it'll be good
to have some nice people

25:38.547 --> 25:39.982
around here for a change.

25:40.115 --> 25:41.583
No offense, doc.

25:42.384 --> 25:44.820
It's amazing
what you seem to do for people.

25:45.187 --> 25:47.089
Nonsense.
It's what they do for me.

25:47.222 --> 25:49.024
Come, you must nourish your body

25:49.158 --> 25:50.926
if you're going to let
the seed take root.

25:51.493 --> 25:54.596
- Why do we wear these tunics?
- To allow for circulation.

25:54.730 --> 25:56.999
Normal clothing's
just too restrictive.

25:57.901 --> 26:00.469
You must learn to
rhythms of life.

26:00.602 --> 26:03.071
It begins
with the primordial fluids.

26:03.439 --> 26:05.307
They're a key element
of treatment here.

26:06.241 --> 26:08.210
It's a cocktail
of herbs and roots,

26:08.343 --> 26:11.680
sourced everywhere
from India to the Amazon.

26:13.982 --> 26:16.785
- There are drugs in this?
- Not pharmaceuticals,

26:16.920 --> 26:18.220
if that's what you're asking.

26:18.353 --> 26:20.589
Many pharmas
are just synthetic copies.

26:20.722 --> 26:22.291
The drug companies can't profit,

26:22.424 --> 26:24.126
so they just
twist the molecules.

26:24.259 --> 26:26.128
These are pure.

26:28.030 --> 26:29.498
Oh, I'm completely healthy,
thanks.

26:29.631 --> 26:32.701
This is for the therapy.
Everyone is tuned.

26:34.236 --> 26:35.571
Danny, even if you are healthy,

26:35.704 --> 26:38.106
can you not exist
at an optimal level?

26:38.674 --> 26:41.710
To ease Marie's burden
and meet her halfway?

26:47.015 --> 26:48.317
Bottoms up.

26:49.017 --> 26:50.452
Cheers.

26:57.993 --> 26:59.695
Oh, you don't drink it, doc?

26:59.828 --> 27:01.063
Bless you, Danny,

27:01.196 --> 27:03.532
but that ship sailed
a long time ago.

27:04.199 --> 27:05.567
How many children do you have?

27:06.134 --> 27:07.904
None that exist in society.

27:08.470 --> 27:10.606
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Oh, don't be.

27:10.739 --> 27:12.899
I have hundreds of children
that it's been my privilege

27:12.976 --> 27:14.476
to help bring into this world.

27:14.610 --> 27:17.246
I don't cry about the past
and neither should you.

27:17.947 --> 27:19.648
Now, eat. Eat!

27:20.082 --> 27:24.019
Aquatic life is among
the most fecund on the planet.

27:25.854 --> 27:27.856
- I'm starving.
- Yeah, me, too.

27:28.590 --> 27:31.159
To create another life
is the most strenuous task

27:31.293 --> 27:33.228
the body can ever undertake.

27:34.196 --> 27:35.397
You must give it every tool

27:35.531 --> 27:37.799
to help it scaffold
its mysteries.

28:29.484 --> 28:32.754
Well, if you excuse me,
I must turn in.

28:33.422 --> 28:34.856
Do enjoy yourselves.

28:35.424 --> 28:37.026
Be sure to get some rest.

28:37.426 --> 28:39.528
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Thank you.

28:46.234 --> 28:47.536
Marie.

28:48.604 --> 28:51.540
- Want to go lay down?
- If you want.

28:53.943 --> 28:56.645
- Let's make a fire.
- Okay.

30:24.033 --> 30:25.534
Oh, man.

30:26.735 --> 30:27.836
Oh.

30:29.871 --> 30:30.940
Shit.

30:41.984 --> 30:44.252
Hey! Hey.

30:45.188 --> 30:46.388
You still want to lay down?

30:46.989 --> 30:49.424
- I think there's something...
- Stop thinking.

31:02.437 --> 31:05.874
[Sultry synth-pop music.

31:46.414 --> 31:48.017
Who's there?

32:09.071 --> 32:11.040
<i>The doctor wishes to see you.</i>

32:12.741 --> 32:14.043
<i>The doctor wishes to see you.</i>

32:14.177 --> 32:16.378
The doctor wishes to see you.

32:31.593 --> 32:33.129
- Good morning.
- Morning.

32:33.262 --> 32:34.663
You wanted to see me?

32:34.796 --> 32:36.631
Uh, yes. Uh, walk with me.

32:41.603 --> 32:44.506
I like to talk
with, uh, each of my charges

32:44.639 --> 32:46.808
in an informal setting at first.

32:47.576 --> 32:50.345
It helps to ease
the rigors of treatment.

32:51.713 --> 32:54.816
Okay, what, uh... what did
you want to talk about?

32:55.817 --> 32:57.619
You see this little sapling?

32:59.554 --> 33:01.456
Do you know what it is?

33:01.991 --> 33:03.059
A bush?

33:03.993 --> 33:05.627
Arbor vitae.

33:06.128 --> 33:07.330
It seems so small

33:07.462 --> 33:09.332
and inconsequential,
does it not?

33:09.731 --> 33:11.901
I mean, yeah, I've seen
more impressive bushes.

33:12.034 --> 33:13.069
That's exactly it.

33:13.202 --> 33:14.603
These little runts

33:14.736 --> 33:16.872
are the fastest growing
trees in the world.

33:17.006 --> 33:19.108
Given abundant sun and water,

33:19.541 --> 33:21.077
they'll soon tower over us.

33:21.610 --> 33:22.644
But right now...

33:23.411 --> 33:27.116
Any weakling could easily tear
this out with his bare hands.

33:31.921 --> 33:33.622
Sorry, I'm not following.

33:34.090 --> 33:35.992
Beginnings are delicate things.

33:37.260 --> 33:39.161
Just as I protect them,

33:39.295 --> 33:40.428
they will shelter me.

33:40.562 --> 33:41.730
Like I nurture you,

33:41.863 --> 33:43.765
you will nurture your new child.

33:46.002 --> 33:47.002
I'm sorry.

33:47.036 --> 33:49.537
No disrespect, but I've had

33:49.671 --> 33:51.140
a lot of doctors,

33:51.274 --> 33:52.774
and I've, um...

33:53.408 --> 33:54.509
Tried everything.

33:54.643 --> 33:56.178
I know what they did to you.

33:56.578 --> 33:58.713
The travesty
of that botched delivery.

33:59.148 --> 34:01.449
It infuriates me
that doctors like that

34:01.583 --> 34:03.685
are permitted
to continue their practice.

34:04.253 --> 34:06.022
You won't have that
heartbreak here.

34:09.258 --> 34:10.558
But you must trust me...

34:12.261 --> 34:13.595
And trust the process.

34:20.702 --> 34:21.836
I'll do anything you say.

34:21.971 --> 34:24.773
Then success is all but yours.

34:30.246 --> 34:31.513
Get the pistol out.

34:33.481 --> 34:35.184
What are you doing?

34:40.156 --> 34:41.991
They're quite
invasive this year.

34:47.330 --> 34:49.332
Paralysis. I'm a doctor.

34:49.731 --> 34:52.335
I can't let any creature
end its life through trauma.

34:52.935 --> 34:54.736
No matter what the nuisance...

34:57.472 --> 34:59.108
It must be done humanely.

35:02.844 --> 35:04.380
Wait. He killed it?

35:04.512 --> 35:05.982
Yeah, with a syringe.

35:06.681 --> 35:08.050
He... he said it was...
It was like

35:08.184 --> 35:09.718
some pest control or something.

35:09.851 --> 35:11.187
Well, it is the country, I know

35:11.320 --> 35:12.620
they cull the animals out here

35:12.754 --> 35:14.890
from time to time,
so maybe that's it.

35:16.858 --> 35:18.793
Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

35:18.928 --> 35:20.695
- It was weird.
- You're overthinking it.

35:20.829 --> 35:22.231

Excellent!
Any swelling or discomfort?

35:58.401 --> 36:00.635
Any reactions at all?

36:00.769 --> 36:03.172
No, no, doctor. Nothing bad.

36:03.305 --> 36:04.340
I just...

36:04.873 --> 36:07.276
Well, I've been having
a lot of energy

36:07.410 --> 36:11.313
and I've been feeling
these really, really...

36:12.481 --> 36:14.316
Heightened sensations.

36:14.450 --> 36:15.518

36:15.918 --> 36:18.586
- Yes.
- That's wonderful.

signaling its readiness.

Oh. Really?

36:25.394 --> 36:26.694
Well, that's great.

Wow.

37:06.368 --> 37:08.670
It uses a combination
of ultraviolet light,

37:08.803 --> 37:09.871
high frequency sound...

37:12.074 --> 37:14.310
And beta particles
to regenerate the follicles.

37:37.799 --> 37:39.435
I'm certain
you have had far too many

37:39.568 --> 37:40.702
of these examinations,

37:40.835 --> 37:42.071
so I'll do my utmost to make

37:42.204 --> 37:43.805
you as comfortable as possible.

37:44.373 --> 37:46.542
Danny,
I trust you're empathetic,

37:47.343 --> 37:50.146
because this is an indignity
that no man has to suffer.

37:50.279 --> 37:52.647
Hey. I'm here for you, baby.

37:53.048 --> 37:56.252
I read the medical
reports. I'm sorry.

37:57.052 --> 37:59.754
It must have been
very difficult for you.

38:00.322 --> 38:01.390
For you both.

38:02.391 --> 38:05.528
Why are you apologizing?
It's not your fault.

38:05.895 --> 38:07.463
I'm apologizing...

38:08.330 --> 38:10.332
Because I know they never do.

38:11.167 --> 38:13.202
Now, you're gonna feel
some pressure.

38:18.740 --> 38:21.110
There is much tissue damage.

38:23.678 --> 38:24.947
Is everything okay?

38:28.184 --> 38:30.452
You are a viable candidate.

38:31.853 --> 38:33.688
- Viable?
- Mm-hmm.

38:35.191 --> 38:38.726
Wow, that's...
That's a really big needle.

38:38.860 --> 38:40.596
Don't be intimidated
by the size,

38:40.728 --> 38:42.064
it's what's inside that counts.

38:42.198 --> 38:43.831
No, that... that's too big!

38:43.966 --> 38:45.935
Yeah, no, if she's
uncomfortable, let's just...

38:46.068 --> 38:48.070
No need to be so dramatic.

38:48.204 --> 38:49.871
Now I'm going
to repair the uterus.

38:50.239 --> 38:52.341
It's just some stem cells.

38:55.411 --> 38:58.480
There. Nothing to worry about.

39:06.021 --> 39:08.157
Uh, there's just
one more thing, my boy.

39:09.291 --> 39:11.927
- Me?
- I said this was a partnership.

39:14.396 --> 39:15.464
Tag, you're it.

39:16.699 --> 39:17.967
I'm gonna go get changed, okay?

39:18.100 --> 39:19.935
Don't worry,
the boys have it easy.

39:20.069 --> 39:21.413
Yeah.
I'll catch up with you later.

39:21.437 --> 39:22.504
Okay.

39:23.539 --> 39:26.575
So, what do you need
to check, exactly?

39:26.976 --> 39:28.810
The same as in any measurement:

39:29.678 --> 39:30.946
Quality and quantity.

39:37.586 --> 39:39.854
That's a weird
way to spell "vagina."

40:29.438 --> 40:31.440
Hey! Here.

40:32.174 --> 40:33.409
- What's this?
- I don't know,

40:33.542 --> 40:35.644
some kind of
Brazilian restorative.

40:35.778 --> 40:37.046
It's good for you.

40:37.713 --> 40:39.281
And yummy. Drink it.

40:41.417 --> 40:42.484
Drink it.

40:48.590 --> 40:51.460
Hey, was there anything weird
about that exam?

40:51.593 --> 40:53.262
- Anything odd?
- No.

40:53.395 --> 40:55.115
What about that machine?
What was that like?

40:55.564 --> 40:59.501
Mm... a little tingly.
That's all.

41:02.371 --> 41:04.640
You're telling me
everything was totally normal?

41:05.074 --> 41:06.809
You laying naked on the machine

41:06.942 --> 41:09.378
and him chatting you up while...

41:10.079 --> 41:11.347
Prodding you?

41:13.048 --> 41:15.217
Was that hard for you to watch?

41:16.185 --> 41:18.454
No, I'm just checking.

41:19.788 --> 41:21.056
What's up, Danny?

41:25.461 --> 41:27.196
It just didn't seem
aboveboard to me.

41:27.329 --> 41:29.698
Like it almost felt like
he was flirting with you.

41:30.332 --> 41:32.867
What?!
He's, like, 100 years old.

41:33.736 --> 41:36.772
I get it, that was weird
for you to watch, but...

41:37.606 --> 41:40.809
I... I think it was sweet
of him to include you, no?

41:40.943 --> 41:43.879
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Just...

41:46.281 --> 41:47.883
I thought he was enjoying it.

41:48.584 --> 41:50.085
Ew, Danny, why...

41:50.219 --> 41:52.187
Why would you put
that in my head?

41:54.156 --> 41:55.758
We're getting medical treatment

41:55.891 --> 41:57.960
from a world-class physician

41:58.093 --> 42:00.028
and you're going down
the jealousy route?

42:00.162 --> 42:01.530
I get that he's eccentric,

42:01.663 --> 42:04.700
but don't forget,
this place is our last shot.

42:04.833 --> 42:07.069
I don't know if I can
have you in the room anymore

42:07.202 --> 42:09.338
if you're gonna keep
freaking out like this.

42:12.474 --> 42:14.543
Yeah. Yeah.

42:15.110 --> 42:17.212
Just go with the flow.

42:19.014 --> 42:20.449
Chaturanga.

42:34.596 --> 42:40.102
Oh. Oh, yogi, man.
Oh, please. Ow, oh, god.

42:43.572 --> 42:44.706
Yogi man...

42:44.840 --> 42:47.543
Psst.
Not one bad day job, is it?

42:49.978 --> 42:50.978
Oh.

42:51.079 --> 42:52.181
You'll thank me later.

43:00.088 --> 43:02.357
Up dog.

43:02.491 --> 43:03.258
Oh, no.

43:03.392 --> 43:04.760
You can do it, Mel.

43:04.894 --> 43:06.161
No, I don't plank.

43:06.295 --> 43:07.429
Baby, just get down, babe.

43:07.563 --> 43:09.031
- Shut up.
- Up dog.

43:09.164 --> 43:10.999
- Okay.
- Inhale.

43:11.133 --> 43:13.302
- Ow.
- Down dog. Exhale.

43:13.836 --> 43:14.970
Oh, dear.

43:15.103 --> 43:16.572
It's good for the baby.

43:45.601 --> 43:48.604
They sure do get
the blood pumping, don't they?

43:52.608 --> 43:54.510
Yeah, I'm not
so sure about that.

43:55.577 --> 43:58.080
Oh, you will be.

43:59.481 --> 44:01.617
Ugh. Just look at 'em.

44:02.651 --> 44:05.354
Like two little kitty cats
playing in the sun.

44:06.522 --> 44:07.589
Meow.

44:10.259 --> 44:12.327
Ah, what a waste.

44:13.795 --> 44:15.597
At least we've got
a good guy to girl ratio,

44:15.731 --> 44:16.798
though, right?

44:17.633 --> 44:20.035
I love my wife, man.
She's all I need.

44:23.238 --> 44:24.740
Right. Right.

44:26.308 --> 44:27.743
So, you're saying
you have no desire

44:27.876 --> 44:29.278
to watch those two...

44:29.879 --> 44:31.179
Make out?

44:36.118 --> 44:37.819
Eyes front, soldier.

44:38.220 --> 44:40.656
I'm kidding. Relax.

44:40.789 --> 44:41.891
Funny.

44:42.758 --> 44:44.359
Why are you not drinking
your drink?

44:44.961 --> 44:46.662
I am, see?

44:49.097 --> 44:50.399
- Yummy.
- Good.

44:50.799 --> 44:52.501
'Cause I want
to show you something.

44:52.634 --> 44:54.269
Come on.

45:12.220 --> 45:15.591
Baby, what...
Ah! What are you doing?

45:16.291 --> 45:19.896
Just a little love bite. Hmm?
I'll kiss it, make it better.

45:22.497 --> 45:24.099
What'd I say?

45:24.232 --> 45:25.634
What?

46:50.452 --> 46:52.254
- Hi.
- Mm.

46:54.023 --> 46:55.091
How are you feeling?

46:55.457 --> 46:58.961
Oh, like I was ravished
by an animal.

47:01.630 --> 47:04.599
Oh, god, I really hope
they don't charge us for that.

47:08.336 --> 47:09.604
Oh, shit.

47:10.940 --> 47:12.108
What're you doing?

47:12.240 --> 47:13.442
I'm late.

47:13.575 --> 47:14.575
What're you doing?

47:14.676 --> 47:16.344
Oh, god.

47:16.478 --> 47:17.478
I'll see you later, okay?

47:17.579 --> 47:18.948
When are you coming back?

47:20.348 --> 47:22.784
Marie! Oh, god.

47:23.920 --> 47:25.253
Marie!

47:25.888 --> 47:27.489
Hey, Marie!

47:28.124 --> 47:29.758
Oh! Hello.

47:29.892 --> 47:30.960
Can I help you?

47:31.359 --> 47:33.695
Uh... have you seen my wife?

47:33.829 --> 47:35.831
No, you are scheduled at 11:00.

47:35.965 --> 47:37.033
Right.

47:37.599 --> 47:38.633
Did you have an accident?

47:39.234 --> 47:42.304
Oh, that? No, no, that's...
That's... that's nothing.

47:43.538 --> 47:44.806
Please ready yourself.

47:49.344 --> 47:50.980
Jeez. Privacy.

47:52.148 --> 47:53.548
Ah, shit.

47:56.618 --> 47:57.887
What's this gonna...

48:06.361 --> 48:07.629
Huh.

48:30.852 --> 48:31.954
Again?

48:48.637 --> 48:50.338
All vitals are progressing well.

48:53.375 --> 48:54.585
I believe you have a good chance

48:54.609 --> 48:56.913
at gestation, and soon.

48:57.679 --> 48:58.981
So, how do you feel?

49:00.149 --> 49:02.617
Good. Really good.

49:03.418 --> 49:04.686
Hey.

49:05.787 --> 49:08.456
Hey. We're in great shape.

49:08.590 --> 49:09.724
Isn't that right, doctor?

49:09.858 --> 49:11.894
I would say excellent shape.

49:12.028 --> 49:13.461
The uterine damage is healing

49:13.595 --> 49:15.664
and the viable follicles
nearly developed.

49:16.398 --> 49:17.632
Isn't that great?

49:19.367 --> 49:20.367
It's wonderful.

49:20.468 --> 49:21.670
Okay, well,

49:21.803 --> 49:23.471
I'll, uh, leave you
boys to it, huh?

49:28.311 --> 49:29.711
You know the drill.

49:33.481 --> 49:34.749
Here you go.

49:36.953 --> 49:38.988
Excellent volume
and consistency.

49:41.723 --> 49:43.159
You're really coming along.

49:43.292 --> 49:44.359
Coming along?

49:44.492 --> 49:46.195
Where was I?

49:46.963 --> 49:49.564
How is the new diet
and environment treating you?

49:50.099 --> 49:51.366
Good, uh...

49:52.734 --> 49:54.136
Really good, actually.

49:54.270 --> 49:58.473
Uh, I don't know
how to quite say this, but...

49:59.541 --> 50:00.809
My...

50:05.413 --> 50:07.350
- Oh.
- Has been off the charts.

50:07.482 --> 50:08.918
Oh, that's common.

50:09.051 --> 50:10.661
What do you guys put in those
drinks anyways?

50:10.685 --> 50:11.921
Spanish fly?

50:12.054 --> 50:13.289
Cantharadin?

50:13.421 --> 50:15.892
No, no, Danny,
that's highly toxic.

50:16.591 --> 50:18.560
So, then,
what do you use, exactly?

50:18.693 --> 50:20.562
I won't bore you
with the composition,

50:21.030 --> 50:23.498
unless you're familiar
with orgo and biochem.

50:23.865 --> 50:26.002
- No, not really...
- Ah, very well.

50:27.736 --> 50:29.604
Bet a lot of people
would buy this stuff.

50:32.407 --> 50:34.043
Does it look like I'm motivated

50:34.176 --> 50:35.777
by commercial interests?

50:38.247 --> 50:40.016
You seem to do
pretty well for yourself, doc.

50:40.149 --> 50:42.550
That's why I'm treating you
and your wife for free?

50:42.684 --> 50:44.428
- What's in it for you, then?
- It's not for me.

50:44.452 --> 50:46.155
It's for humanity.

50:46.821 --> 50:48.291
With the falling birth rates

50:48.423 --> 50:50.558
and the rise
of congenital problems,

50:50.692 --> 50:52.827
the work we do here
is of vital importance

50:52.962 --> 50:54.130
to the species.

50:54.263 --> 50:55.530
Species?

50:56.631 --> 50:58.034
That's a bit grandiose.

50:58.167 --> 51:00.635
Our breakthroughs
have the potential to shift

51:00.769 --> 51:03.105
our understanding
of life forever!

51:03.239 --> 51:04.307
Breakthroughs?

51:05.174 --> 51:06.875
You mean,
you're still doing research?

51:07.009 --> 51:09.644
Danny, I appreciate
an inquisitive mind,

51:10.179 --> 51:13.049
but the tone of your questions
is getting tiresome.

51:13.182 --> 51:15.918
I take copious notes
on the efficacy of treatment.

51:16.052 --> 51:18.372
- What scientist would not?
- Yeah, sure, doc. Of course...

51:18.486 --> 51:20.789
Danny, let me ask you
a question now.

51:21.257 --> 51:23.259
Are you sure you're ready
to be a father?

51:23.392 --> 51:24.659
Me?

51:26.195 --> 51:27.462
Yes.

51:28.264 --> 51:29.631
I love my wife.

51:31.133 --> 51:32.234
Hmm.

51:37.605 --> 51:39.442
The feeling is incredible

51:39.574 --> 51:41.743
and sometimes last for hours.

51:41.876 --> 51:44.080
Wow. No side effects?

51:44.213 --> 51:45.714
Not that I've felt.

51:46.715 --> 51:47.950
When do I get to that level?

51:48.084 --> 51:49.684
You'll get there
when you're ready.

51:49.818 --> 51:53.255
So, have you been feeling
a little more...

51:56.359 --> 51:57.359
I guess.

51:57.460 --> 51:58.693
Isn't that a little weird

51:58.827 --> 52:00.029
for medical treatment?

52:00.162 --> 52:01.964
Not for what we're trying to do.

52:02.098 --> 52:04.033
We were curious about what all

52:04.166 --> 52:06.202
the extra activities were about.

52:07.236 --> 52:09.038
He's sometimes a little much.

52:09.171 --> 52:10.906
But I like that he's different.

52:11.340 --> 52:13.476
Our other doctors
never seemed to care,

52:13.608 --> 52:15.610
but with Dr. Lands...

52:16.379 --> 52:17.645
We're special.

52:19.448 --> 52:21.117
Yeah, I felt that, too.

52:22.151 --> 52:23.551
Honestly, I didn't think.

52:23.986 --> 52:26.255
I, um, had another chance.

52:28.823 --> 52:30.792
We're here with you, girl.

52:31.394 --> 52:32.395
Thank you.

52:37.699 --> 52:39.068
So...

52:39.201 --> 52:41.203
Has Danny been okay?

52:41.736 --> 52:43.105
Mostly well.

52:43.671 --> 52:44.739
What do you mean?

52:45.107 --> 52:46.841
How's he been taking
the treatment?

52:50.645 --> 52:52.580
- That's good.
- Why?

52:56.551 --> 52:59.088
Some people aren't as ready

52:59.455 --> 53:00.990
as they may say.

53:01.123 --> 53:03.758
Right,
but Danny found this place.

53:03.893 --> 53:05.860
Did he think
this place was a guarantee?

53:08.330 --> 53:09.597
I don't know.

53:13.668 --> 53:15.637
There you are. Hey.

53:15.770 --> 53:18.007
- Hey.
- Hello, ladies.

53:18.640 --> 53:20.376
Uh, can I talk to you for a sec?

53:20.509 --> 53:21.576
Yeah. What's up?

53:21.709 --> 53:22.945
Uh, alone.

53:23.079 --> 53:24.547
- Okay.
- Sorry.

53:24.914 --> 53:26.549
- Come on.
- Ow.

53:26.681 --> 53:29.751
Hey! Easy, buddy.
She's not your property.

53:29.885 --> 53:32.254
I'll bring her
right back, ladies. Come on.

53:33.456 --> 53:35.491
Look, I've been noticing
more and more things

53:35.623 --> 53:36.992
that just don't make sense.

53:38.060 --> 53:39.661
I mean, everything's different.

53:39.794 --> 53:41.263
What exactly
are you worried about?

53:41.397 --> 53:44.033
Don't you get the feeling
that we're being watched?

53:44.799 --> 53:46.435
By the staff
or whatever they are?

53:46.569 --> 53:48.003
No, it's more than that.

53:50.973 --> 53:52.475
You remember that lamp we broke?

53:52.942 --> 53:54.676
Yeah, what about it?

53:54.809 --> 53:57.113
It didn't look like
a lamp on the inside.

53:58.780 --> 54:01.050
I don't know,
it's just a feeling,

54:01.783 --> 54:03.852
but I, uh...

54:04.786 --> 54:06.388
I think we should go.

54:06.522 --> 54:08.402
You're the one that told me to
have some hope...

54:08.491 --> 54:09.568
- I know.
- And now that things

54:09.592 --> 54:10.593
are starting to progress,

54:10.725 --> 54:11.961
you want to go?

54:12.094 --> 54:14.096
Are you sure you want a baby?

54:14.230 --> 54:16.932
Yes, I'm sure, Marie.
I love you more than anything.

54:17.066 --> 54:20.069
It's this place
that I'm not so sure about.

54:20.202 --> 54:21.937
Look, I can't put
my finger on it just yet,

54:22.071 --> 54:23.506
but something is going on.

54:24.039 --> 54:26.708
Okay, I'll check
the closets for a monster.

54:27.443 --> 54:28.477
I'm serious.

54:28.611 --> 54:31.280
Okay. Fine. I will.

54:31.413 --> 54:32.948
- Okay.
- Promise.

54:34.649 --> 54:37.019
- I swear.
- Okay, come on.

55:08.850 --> 55:10.852
What did you just say?

55:11.420 --> 55:12.454
What?

55:14.356 --> 55:16.791
Dance with me, Danny.
Dance with me.

55:18.160 --> 55:20.695
Dance with me.
Dance with me, Danny!

55:23.966 --> 55:25.800
Oh!

55:28.870 --> 55:31.706
This is all so lovely.

55:31.839 --> 55:33.275
Yeah, it's so nice.

55:33.943 --> 55:35.644
Hey, what is healthy living

55:35.777 --> 55:38.780
without a little
outdoor action, eh?

55:40.848 --> 55:43.986
Hey, oh-ho-oh,
I got us all some fruit.

55:44.353 --> 55:47.456
Grapes, bananas, the works.

55:47.590 --> 55:49.358
Attend to me, Steve.

55:50.459 --> 55:51.527
All right. Oh.

55:52.094 --> 55:53.462
Here you go, sweetie.

55:53.596 --> 55:55.297
Here you go, yeah.

55:55.431 --> 55:57.233
Guys, what's up
with this treatment?

55:57.700 --> 55:58.833
It's worth every penny.

55:59.401 --> 56:00.768
You'd know about that,
right, Izzy?

56:01.537 --> 56:03.172
Except for having
to hang out with you.

56:03.305 --> 56:05.207
Oh, shush. You love me.

56:05.740 --> 56:07.109
I'm the one male

56:07.243 --> 56:08.683
you can throw
all that negativity to.

56:08.776 --> 56:10.479
Marie, how are you feeling?

56:11.080 --> 56:12.481
This is all too perfect.

56:12.615 --> 56:14.116
I mean, who wouldn't love this?

56:14.250 --> 56:16.318
Right, but is all this
really necessary

56:16.452 --> 56:17.752
for a medical treatment?

56:17.886 --> 56:20.122
Perhaps, perhaps not.

56:20.256 --> 56:22.324
I believe everything
that affects the mother

56:22.458 --> 56:23.758
affects the embryo.

56:24.426 --> 56:27.862
So, why not surround her
with beauty and bliss?

56:27.997 --> 56:29.864
But doc, there's no baby yet.

56:29.999 --> 56:32.501
So... are we just...

56:33.369 --> 56:36.171
Dangling this idea in
front of us so we believe it?

56:36.305 --> 56:37.539
Oh, Danny, have some faith.

56:38.173 --> 56:40.409
Marie,
you have faith, don't you?

56:40.542 --> 56:41.843
I do.

56:44.480 --> 56:46.015
Well, I don't know about y'all,

56:46.148 --> 56:48.816
but I got so much faith

56:48.951 --> 56:51.320
that I am gonna pull

56:51.453 --> 56:52.655
some of the earth

56:52.787 --> 56:54.623
down into my womb

56:54.757 --> 56:56.925
so we can make a baby.

56:57.059 --> 56:58.394
I know what you're saying!

56:58.527 --> 57:00.529
Do you want to channel
some rays with me?

57:00.663 --> 57:03.465
Oh, please put it...
Oh, the... all of it...

57:09.171 --> 57:12.141
- There we go! There we go.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:12.274 --> 57:13.609
You need to drink more.

57:13.742 --> 57:14.777
Steve...

57:16.378 --> 57:20.149
No, I'm not. No.
That's a little...

57:21.417 --> 57:23.619
I have
a little surprise for you.

57:23.752 --> 57:24.819
Where are we going?

57:25.254 --> 57:27.156
- Away.
- Oh. Okay.

57:28.123 --> 57:30.125
<i>♪ Take me away... ♪</i>

57:31.126 --> 57:33.128
- Bye!
- <i>♪ into the woods ♪</i>

57:33.262 --> 57:34.630
<i>♪ keep watch ♪
♪ keep watch ♪</i>

57:34.763 --> 57:36.198
<i>♪ for the leprechaun ♪</i>

57:36.665 --> 57:38.467
Oh, there they go.

57:44.807 --> 57:46.075
You ready?

57:47.142 --> 57:49.044
- For what?
- A picnic!

58:15.504 --> 58:18.574
- Hey!
- Hey.

58:24.580 --> 58:25.814
Hi.

58:25.948 --> 58:27.983
Just having a little fun.

58:28.117 --> 58:34.923
[Soft music.

59:42.224 --> 59:43.859
- Hey.
- Hmm?

59:43.992 --> 59:45.494
I think I forgot something.

59:45.627 --> 59:46.795
- Okay?
- Okay.

59:46.930 --> 59:48.130
I'll see you soon.

59:48.263 --> 59:50.132
- Mm-hmm. I'll be right back.
- Mm-hmm.

59:57.206 --> 59:58.540
- Hi.
- Hey.

1:00:02.244 --> 1:00:06.515
[Suspenseful music.

1:00:40.382 --> 1:00:42.784
Ah, what the... ah.

1:01:01.938 --> 1:01:03.205
Okay.

1:01:05.140 --> 1:01:06.875
Huh.

1:01:07.010 --> 1:01:08.577
Wonder if...

1:01:13.782 --> 1:01:15.217
Still got it.

1:01:16.218 --> 1:01:17.519
Let's see now...

1:01:19.889 --> 1:01:21.423
What the...

1:01:24.226 --> 1:01:26.128
What the...

1:01:28.031 --> 1:01:30.198
That mother...

1:01:32.801 --> 1:01:34.069
Doctor...

1:01:46.448 --> 1:01:48.083
- Hey, did you find it?
- Uh, yeah.

1:01:48.216 --> 1:01:49.427
Do you wanna take a little walk?

1:01:49.451 --> 1:01:51.486
Oh, no. Now, we call foul.

1:01:51.620 --> 1:01:52.956
Yeah, babe. Give me a minute.

1:01:53.088 --> 1:01:54.256
We're going to sleep soon.

1:01:54.389 --> 1:01:56.091
Okay, so Izzy, you were saying?

1:01:56.224 --> 1:01:57.702
Oh, just that blu
will definitely make

1:01:57.726 --> 1:02:00.195
a better mother than me.

1:02:00.329 --> 1:02:01.931
Right, but how...
How does that work?

1:02:02.065 --> 1:02:03.365
Because you're both the mom.

1:02:03.498 --> 1:02:05.601
The ovum merge
uses both our eggs

1:02:05.734 --> 1:02:08.004
but only mitochondrial DNA
from one.

1:02:08.136 --> 1:02:09.605
What she means is it just...

1:02:09.738 --> 1:02:11.540
Marie, I need to speak to you.

1:02:12.307 --> 1:02:13.709
- Fine.
- Come on.

1:02:14.209 --> 1:02:16.712
Sorry. I'll be back.

1:02:16.845 --> 1:02:18.246
What's going on?

1:02:18.847 --> 1:02:19.882
Shh.

1:02:21.450 --> 1:02:23.052
- What's up?
- I was right.

1:02:23.185 --> 1:02:24.887
- About what?
- He's watching us.

1:02:25.021 --> 1:02:27.255
Of course he's watching us,
he's our doctor.

1:02:27.389 --> 1:02:30.325
No, no,
there are cameras everywhere.

1:02:32.294 --> 1:02:35.197
No camera...
I don't see any cameras.

1:02:35.330 --> 1:02:37.466
Look, that's my point, Marie.
They're hidden.

1:02:37.599 --> 1:02:39.301
I saw the feed in his office.

1:02:39.801 --> 1:02:41.837
- You broke into his office?
- Shh! Yeah.

1:02:41.971 --> 1:02:43.815
You know you can get us
kicked out of here, right?

1:02:43.839 --> 1:02:45.450
- Did you think about that?
- Wait, hold on.

1:02:45.474 --> 1:02:47.342
You don't care
that he's watching us?

1:02:47.476 --> 1:02:49.411
Marie, in our bedroom.

1:02:50.013 --> 1:02:52.214
If he was watching us, then
why didn't you run into him?

1:02:52.982 --> 1:02:55.584
- I... I don't know.
- Exactly, exactly.

1:02:55.717 --> 1:02:58.021
'Cause he's asleep,
like I need to be soon

1:02:58.153 --> 1:03:00.622
if we're going to keep up
with this regimen, okay?

1:03:00.756 --> 1:03:02.858
So please, stop being a weirdo.

1:03:07.362 --> 1:03:08.630
Geez...

1:03:14.603 --> 1:03:15.671
Hey.

1:03:16.271 --> 1:03:17.539
Hey.

1:03:18.340 --> 1:03:19.340
Just wanna sleep.

1:03:19.441 --> 1:03:20.442
Really? Can we...

1:03:20.575 --> 1:03:22.377
No, shh. I'm tired.

1:03:26.548 --> 1:03:28.717
- We need to talk.
- Go to bed.

1:03:30.218 --> 1:03:31.954
- Marie.
- Shh.

1:03:33.622 --> 1:03:36.692
- Marie.
- Shh. Go to bed.

1:03:52.307 --> 1:03:53.575
Hey, Marie.

1:03:55.111 --> 1:03:56.378
Marie?

1:03:59.982 --> 1:04:01.084
There's the sleepyhead.

1:04:01.216 --> 1:04:02.684
A flute for Danny, please.

1:04:02.818 --> 1:04:04.753
Are you sure
I can't have just one sip?

1:04:04.887 --> 1:04:07.990
Mel, I'm sorry,
but we take no chances here.

1:04:08.124 --> 1:04:09.591
Wh... what's the occasion?

1:04:09.725 --> 1:04:11.593
I'm gonna be a father!

1:04:11.727 --> 1:04:14.796
Danny, won't you join us in
a toast to the happy couple?

1:04:15.297 --> 1:04:16.631
Isn't it amazing?

1:04:17.332 --> 1:04:18.333
Right.

1:04:18.467 --> 1:04:19.634
To more beautiful babies.

1:04:19.768 --> 1:04:21.904
To more beautiful babies!

1:04:29.878 --> 1:04:30.947
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

1:04:35.484 --> 1:04:37.719
It has come to my attention...

1:04:38.653 --> 1:04:40.890
That we are doubly blessed.

1:04:51.266 --> 1:04:52.534
No way.

1:04:54.203 --> 1:04:55.203
Hmm.

1:04:55.303 --> 1:04:56.605
No way.

1:04:59.374 --> 1:05:00.575
No need for all that.

1:05:00.709 --> 1:05:02.979
It's a happy occasion,
after all.

1:05:03.112 --> 1:05:04.379
Yeah.

1:05:06.015 --> 1:05:08.683
- We did it!
- Yeah.

1:05:09.651 --> 1:05:11.020
A toast to Marie.

1:05:11.154 --> 1:05:12.420
To Marie.

1:05:21.596 --> 1:05:22.965
Congratulations.

1:05:23.099 --> 1:05:25.600
Thank you.

1:05:46.321 --> 1:05:47.589
Oh, shit...

1:05:53.062 --> 1:05:54.329
Shit.

1:05:58.901 --> 1:06:00.002
Oh, my god.

1:06:10.980 --> 1:06:13.282
The delicate spark of life.

1:06:13.415 --> 1:06:15.750
We must nurture
that spark into a fire

1:06:15.885 --> 1:06:18.753
- and the fire, an inferno.
- Marie.

1:06:18.888 --> 1:06:20.789
Shh, this is about what we
have to do next.

1:06:20.923 --> 1:06:22.992
And the role
of the father is key.

1:06:23.491 --> 1:06:24.961
The heavenly vessel
that is woman

1:06:25.094 --> 1:06:27.495
carrying the light of divinity.

1:06:28.331 --> 1:06:29.798
Who must care for her?

1:06:30.166 --> 1:06:31.633
Pay homage to her?

1:06:32.434 --> 1:06:33.668
It's you.

1:06:34.270 --> 1:06:35.370
And you.

1:06:35.503 --> 1:06:36.771
What about you?

1:06:37.806 --> 1:06:39.342
Are you also like a father?

1:06:39.474 --> 1:06:41.676
Is that what you
consider yourself?

1:06:42.979 --> 1:06:45.547
Is that why you're watching us?

1:06:45.680 --> 1:06:46.925
- Danny.
- You know, from the cameras

1:06:46.949 --> 1:06:48.683
you have all over the place?

1:06:48.817 --> 1:06:50.552
All I do, I do for your care...

1:06:50.685 --> 1:06:51.888
You all know he's got cameras

1:06:52.021 --> 1:06:53.381
hidden throughout
the entire house?

1:06:53.421 --> 1:06:54.856
That he watches and records

1:06:54.991 --> 1:06:56.359
your every move,

1:06:56.491 --> 1:06:59.295
- even in your bedrooms.
- Is that true?

1:06:59.427 --> 1:07:00.695
Danny, what's gotten into you?

1:07:00.829 --> 1:07:02.597
Have you had your tonic today?

1:07:02.731 --> 1:07:04.176
- I'm through with your tonics,
- Danny!

1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:06.302
Your machines, and
the poking and prodding!

1:07:06.434 --> 1:07:07.714
Doctor, what's he talking about?

1:07:07.769 --> 1:07:09.372
Can't you see he's unstable?

1:07:09.504 --> 1:07:11.806
Unstable? Unstable?

1:07:11.941 --> 1:07:14.377
I'm not the one giving people
god knows what to drink.

1:07:14.509 --> 1:07:16.345
I didn't sign up
to be your lab rat.

1:07:16.478 --> 1:07:18.680
No, you are my patient

1:07:18.813 --> 1:07:20.849
and you will respect this place!

1:07:21.516 --> 1:07:23.352
Your outbursts
are endangering the Harmony

1:07:23.485 --> 1:07:24.921
of the new mothers here.

1:07:25.054 --> 1:07:27.489
Please sit down.

1:07:29.524 --> 1:07:30.859
Danny, sit down.

1:07:32.594 --> 1:07:33.862
Sit down.

1:07:39.969 --> 1:07:41.170
Stop.

1:07:41.304 --> 1:07:42.804
Danny! Danny!

1:07:43.272 --> 1:07:46.142
Ever since we got here,
you've been acting strangely.

1:07:46.841 --> 1:07:50.512
Be honest with me.
Do you still want a baby?

1:07:52.148 --> 1:07:53.382
Yes, of course.

1:07:53.515 --> 1:07:54.616
Then, what are you doing?

1:07:54.749 --> 1:07:55.749
I mean, this...

1:07:55.850 --> 1:07:57.452
All of this is wrong,

1:07:57.585 --> 1:07:59.788
whatever he's got going on,
it's all wrong.

1:08:01.991 --> 1:08:03.525
Do you still love me?

1:08:03.658 --> 1:08:04.693
More than anything.

1:08:04.826 --> 1:08:06.561
Then please, stop this.

1:08:06.695 --> 1:08:08.197
- We finally have a shot.
- I know.

1:08:08.331 --> 1:08:11.167
- Don't mess it up.
- I won't... mess it up.

1:08:11.300 --> 1:08:14.469
Please, listen to me.
We will have a baby.

1:08:14.602 --> 1:08:16.305
We will have a baby.

1:08:16.439 --> 1:08:17.719
But we don't need to do it here.

1:08:17.806 --> 1:08:19.408
Wrong, Danny!

1:08:19.541 --> 1:08:21.377
This is the only place
you can do it.

1:08:21.876 --> 1:08:24.512
Unless you don't
really want one?

1:08:32.088 --> 1:08:33.155
What?

1:08:34.190 --> 1:08:35.925
What are you still
doing with that?

1:08:36.058 --> 1:08:37.592
Do you remember it?

1:08:37.726 --> 1:08:39.362
Danny, stop upsetting her!

1:08:39.494 --> 1:08:41.230
We made a baby together.

1:08:42.564 --> 1:08:45.567
You made a baby
without this doctor.

1:08:46.102 --> 1:08:48.137
You and me.

1:08:48.270 --> 1:08:49.571
That's all we need.

1:08:56.278 --> 1:08:57.612
- Please?
- Okay.

1:08:59.248 --> 1:09:00.383
I'm sorry, I...

1:09:00.515 --> 1:09:02.251
Thank you for your hospitality

1:09:02.385 --> 1:09:04.519
but I, uh... we, uh...

1:09:04.652 --> 1:09:08.857
We're being too disruptive
for the delicate work here.

1:09:09.225 --> 1:09:10.259
I... we have to go.

1:09:10.393 --> 1:09:11.760
But you cannot!

1:09:13.062 --> 1:09:14.462
- Excuse me?
- Weren't you listening

1:09:14.529 --> 1:09:16.032
to me earlier? Your pregnancy

1:09:16.165 --> 1:09:17.166
is just beginning.

1:09:17.299 --> 1:09:18.600
Can't you prescribe me something

1:09:18.733 --> 1:09:20.336
and I'll take it at home?

1:09:20.469 --> 1:09:22.304
I would if I could,
but the gen-dine is here.

1:09:22.438 --> 1:09:24.306
It's key to this.
If you leave here now,

1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:25.941
your baby will die.

1:09:27.276 --> 1:09:29.278
Are you willing
to take that chance?

1:09:30.346 --> 1:09:31.414
No.

1:09:31.846 --> 1:09:34.016
Marie, I'll ask you
one last time.

1:09:35.518 --> 1:09:37.819
Do you have faith?

1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:40.056
I do.

1:09:42.525 --> 1:09:43.758
Hey.

1:09:44.493 --> 1:09:47.096
May we please sit down?

1:09:59.942 --> 1:10:01.343
Sit down.

1:10:01.477 --> 1:10:02.610
No, please.

1:10:02.744 --> 1:10:04.612
No.

1:10:21.629 --> 1:10:22.898
Everyone...

1:10:23.966 --> 1:10:26.569
We're going to do
a breathing exercise here

1:10:26.701 --> 1:10:28.104
to calm our nerves.

1:10:28.770 --> 1:10:31.574
Danny, you can join
or you can leave,

1:10:31.974 --> 1:10:35.010
but you will not
be disruptive again.

1:10:40.883 --> 1:10:42.617
I'm not leaving my baby.

1:11:37.139 --> 1:11:39.175
Won't you join me, Danny?

1:11:59.061 --> 1:12:01.130
Are you a student of history?

1:12:04.633 --> 1:12:05.901
A bit. Why?

1:12:07.469 --> 1:12:11.040
Do you know the origins
of the world's space programs?

1:12:12.274 --> 1:12:15.477
The original ballistics program
of Von braun for Germany?

1:12:16.878 --> 1:12:18.514
Do you know the details
of his past?

1:12:18.647 --> 1:12:19.714
What's your point?

1:12:19.847 --> 1:12:21.617
That past includes thousands,

1:12:21.749 --> 1:12:23.018
if not tens of thousands

1:12:23.152 --> 1:12:24.620
who suffered and died

1:12:24.752 --> 1:12:26.388
in the cold,
wet mines of metalwork.

1:12:26.522 --> 1:12:29.124
Yeah, the guy
was a Nazi rocket engineer.

1:12:30.725 --> 1:12:34.296
Are there any more historical
villains you'd like to discuss?

1:12:39.001 --> 1:12:41.170
I know you've been
snooping in my lab.

1:12:42.204 --> 1:12:44.006
Whatever you think you've seen,

1:12:44.139 --> 1:12:46.175
I'm asking you
to put it behind you

1:12:46.308 --> 1:12:49.311
for the sake
of your wife and your child.

1:12:51.413 --> 1:12:52.982
Is that what you wanted
to talk about?

1:12:53.549 --> 1:12:55.317
Because I should really
get going to bed.

1:12:55.451 --> 1:12:57.162
I feel you've become
critical of my methods.

1:12:57.186 --> 1:12:58.654
Who am I to judge, doc?

1:12:58.786 --> 1:13:00.346
I mean, you've obviously
gotten results.

1:13:00.389 --> 1:13:02.291
I bring light to those
who are bereft of it.

1:13:02.424 --> 1:13:04.360
Is that not a worthy task?

1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:06.028
Sure, doc...

1:13:06.595 --> 1:13:08.697
But what's that have to do
with spying on people?

1:13:09.265 --> 1:13:11.066
The more data I have,
the more I can help...

1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:13.902
What kind of data do you get
from watching people fuck?

1:13:14.036 --> 1:13:15.671
Are you certain
you want to conceive?

1:13:16.338 --> 1:13:18.474
Because questions
have been raised.

1:13:18.607 --> 1:13:20.808
If you try any of your
bullshit with Marie, I'll...

1:13:20.943 --> 1:13:22.344
You'll what?

1:13:25.047 --> 1:13:26.348
Don't try me.

1:14:09.958 --> 1:14:11.327
Where am I?

1:14:11.460 --> 1:14:13.828
It's a little late
for questions.

1:14:13.962 --> 1:14:15.122
You should've thought of that

1:14:15.230 --> 1:14:16.308
before you started creating

1:14:16.332 --> 1:14:17.599
all these problems for me.

1:14:17.733 --> 1:14:19.101
You...

1:14:21.537 --> 1:14:23.539
Oh, don't fight the anxiolytic.

1:14:23.672 --> 1:14:26.075
It's not as if you're gonna
remember any of this, anyway.

1:14:27.910 --> 1:14:31.914
Now, there's just one
more thing we need from you.

1:14:37.052 --> 1:14:38.354
No...

1:14:40.622 --> 1:14:41.890
No.

1:14:46.128 --> 1:14:48.464
You're not a cooperative guy,
are you Danny?

1:14:49.431 --> 1:14:52.568
Not like your lovely wife.
She's much better.

1:14:54.303 --> 1:14:56.271
We like her, don't we?

1:15:14.790 --> 1:15:16.091
Marie?

1:15:18.060 --> 1:15:19.428
Oh, god.

1:15:21.530 --> 1:15:22.798
So, I had a dream

1:15:22.931 --> 1:15:24.433
and we were back
at my childhood home

1:15:24.566 --> 1:15:26.735
and, like, my friend,
Kate, was there...

1:15:26.869 --> 1:15:28.437
Where's Marie?

1:15:30.539 --> 1:15:32.179
Oh, come on, you guys
are gonna ignore me?

1:15:32.274 --> 1:15:33.809
Hey, hey, look.

1:15:33.942 --> 1:15:37.079
Some of us want a peaceful
environment for treatment.

1:15:39.915 --> 1:15:41.583
Fucking charity case.

1:15:43.118 --> 1:15:44.453
Sorry.

1:15:47.156 --> 1:15:48.557
Have you guys seen Marie?

1:15:49.925 --> 1:15:52.194
What? You guys hate me, too?

1:15:55.197 --> 1:15:57.099
I believe she's with Dr. Lands.

1:15:57.232 --> 1:15:59.835
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1:16:00.002 --> 1:16:03.572
Did any part of the doc's
treatment ever feel off?

1:16:03.705 --> 1:16:07.009
The examination or treatment
ever feel not right?

1:16:07.576 --> 1:16:09.278
Now that you mention it...

1:16:10.746 --> 1:16:11.780
No.

1:16:12.381 --> 1:16:16.151
Danny, he is a goddamn genius.

1:16:19.087 --> 1:16:20.389
He's with Marie now?

1:16:23.225 --> 1:16:26.762
Oxygen supercharges
the body's regenerative powers.

1:16:26.896 --> 1:16:29.264
It helps to make the baby
strong within you.

1:16:29.398 --> 1:16:30.833
What are you doing to her?

1:16:30.966 --> 1:16:32.086
Why does she have a mask on?

1:16:32.134 --> 1:16:33.402
No, I don't have to explain

1:16:33.535 --> 1:16:35.170
my methods to you.
Hey! Stop that!

1:16:35.304 --> 1:16:36.906
What are you doing?

1:16:37.039 --> 1:16:38.116
We're getting out of here, baby.

1:16:38.140 --> 1:16:40.075
Will you stop that? Danny!

1:16:40.209 --> 1:16:41.619
I should've done
this a long time ago.

1:16:41.643 --> 1:16:43.021
We're leaving, honey,
we're leaving.

1:16:43.045 --> 1:16:45.414
Come on.
Don't... don't touch her.

1:16:55.457 --> 1:16:57.125
We're leaving.
Know what's good for you,

1:16:57.259 --> 1:16:58.527
- you'll leave too.
- Stop!

1:16:58.660 --> 1:17:00.662
Nobody's going anywhere.

1:17:01.296 --> 1:17:03.665
We must have calm
for the gestation.

1:17:03.799 --> 1:17:05.167
Come on.

1:17:05.300 --> 1:17:07.536
- Stop that!
- Wait!

1:17:08.370 --> 1:17:09.671
You can't do that.

1:17:09.805 --> 1:17:12.608
- You're with him?
- I'm with the baby.

1:17:13.475 --> 1:17:15.010
You're all in on it?

1:17:15.143 --> 1:17:18.714
Danny, stop.
You're acting crazy.

1:17:18.847 --> 1:17:20.415
Stay out of my way.

1:17:21.049 --> 1:17:22.484
Doctor, what is that...

1:17:22.986 --> 1:17:24.253
Oh!

1:17:24.386 --> 1:17:27.489
Dammit, everyone upstairs!
Stop that!

1:17:34.396 --> 1:17:36.565
- Sebastian! Stop them!
- Come on.

1:17:38.033 --> 1:17:39.368
We have to get her!

1:17:39.501 --> 1:17:41.770
That mad man
is taking them away from us.

1:17:45.140 --> 1:17:46.140
Who are you?

1:17:50.980 --> 1:17:52.015
Danny! Danny...

1:17:54.483 --> 1:17:56.418
- Run!
- What about you?

1:17:56.552 --> 1:17:58.888
I'll be fine! Get help!

1:18:08.630 --> 1:18:09.698
Marie!

1:18:29.585 --> 1:18:30.719
Ah! Shit!

1:19:04.152 --> 1:19:05.787
I know
you're out here somewhere.

1:19:10.792 --> 1:19:12.661
Come back to the institute.

1:19:14.296 --> 1:19:17.033
This is just
a big misunderstanding.

1:19:20.435 --> 1:19:22.905
All that stress and tension...

1:19:23.639 --> 1:19:25.975
It's not too late
to have a healthy baby.

1:19:26.109 --> 1:19:27.376
Is that what that thing is?

1:19:27.509 --> 1:19:29.311
Why so quick to judgment?

1:19:29.878 --> 1:19:32.081
I admit
he has some imperfections,

1:19:32.214 --> 1:19:33.983
but then again, don't we all?

1:19:34.816 --> 1:19:37.152
I think he's unique
and beautiful.

1:19:37.285 --> 1:19:38.955
He's an abomination!

1:19:39.088 --> 1:19:41.323
That's not
very nice of you, Danny.

1:19:42.257 --> 1:19:43.759
You might hurt his feelings.

1:20:01.543 --> 1:20:03.578
Seba, hold him there!

1:20:06.883 --> 1:20:08.450
Hold him still.

1:20:17.492 --> 1:20:19.327
- Let him go.
- You sure about that?

1:20:19.461 --> 1:20:21.763
Doesn't seem
like he knows how to swim.

1:20:25.267 --> 1:20:27.335
He's all that I have left.

1:20:28.037 --> 1:20:29.105
Is this your son?

1:20:29.638 --> 1:20:32.340
Oh, you couldn't
possibly understand.

1:20:33.442 --> 1:20:35.477
Please bring him to shore.

1:20:36.378 --> 1:20:39.314
Drop the gun
and back away slowly.

1:20:40.083 --> 1:20:41.117
Drop it now!

1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:45.821
Okay, back up!

1:20:53.862 --> 1:20:56.431
Find her.
She's the important one.

1:21:36.738 --> 1:21:37.739
Help!

1:21:43.445 --> 1:21:45.447
- The fuck do you want?
- I...

1:21:45.580 --> 1:21:47.092
What the fuck are you
trespassing on my property for?

1:21:47.116 --> 1:21:49.518
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I...

1:21:49.651 --> 1:21:51.087
People are chasing me.

1:21:51.220 --> 1:21:52.521
I don't know where I am.
Help me.

1:21:52.654 --> 1:21:53.855
- Help you?
- Yes.

1:21:53.990 --> 1:21:55.430
How the fuck
I'm supposed to do that?

1:21:55.557 --> 1:21:57.459
I... I don't... my husband and I,

1:21:57.592 --> 1:22:00.662
we're at a facility nearby...
A... a medical facility.

1:22:00.796 --> 1:22:02.507
- And they won't let us leave.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

1:22:02.531 --> 1:22:03.665
a fucking medical facility?

1:22:03.799 --> 1:22:05.168
What are ya, a goddamn junky?

1:22:05.300 --> 1:22:06.903
No, no, we're lost...

1:22:07.036 --> 1:22:08.271
I don't give a shit.

1:22:08.403 --> 1:22:09.906
Fuck I care if you're lost.

1:22:10.039 --> 1:22:12.141
Look, I don't want
no part of any of this bullshit

1:22:12.275 --> 1:22:13.595
so get the fuck out
of here, lady.

1:22:13.708 --> 1:22:15.677
- Please, I'm pregnant.
- Oh, horseshit.

1:22:15.811 --> 1:22:18.446
Yes. No, I'm serious.
Please, please help me.

1:22:19.381 --> 1:22:20.816
For real?
You ain't fucking with me?

1:22:20.950 --> 1:22:22.651
All I need
is to make a phone call.

1:22:22.784 --> 1:22:25.021
- That's all I need.
- Well, I don't have a fuckin'

1:22:25.154 --> 1:22:26.621
cell phone. What you think?

1:22:26.755 --> 1:22:28.490
I want cancer
of the dick and balls?

1:22:28.623 --> 1:22:30.358
Jesus Christ.

1:22:30.492 --> 1:22:32.694
What? What?

1:22:32.828 --> 1:22:34.563
All right.
Look, just calm down, lady.

1:22:34.696 --> 1:22:36.616
All right, look, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

1:22:36.966 --> 1:22:38.966
There's a payphone at the gas
station down the road

1:22:39.001 --> 1:22:41.046
a piece, all right? I'll give
you a ride down there...

1:22:41.070 --> 1:22:42.337
- Ah!
- Ah!

1:22:44.873 --> 1:22:48.743
Get off me! Get off me!

1:22:50.112 --> 1:22:53.448
Get off me, get off me!
Get off me!

1:23:03.292 --> 1:23:04.292
Look at me.

1:23:04.392 --> 1:23:05.594
- Did he hurt you?
- No.

1:23:05.727 --> 1:23:07.096
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1:23:09.966 --> 1:23:11.033
Hold this.

1:23:21.543 --> 1:23:22.979
Come on, baby. Let's move.

1:23:41.898 --> 1:23:43.732
- What? What?
- Oh, god.

1:23:43.865 --> 1:23:45.268
Come on, we gotta keep going.

1:23:45.400 --> 1:23:47.602
Go? Go where? Where?

1:23:47.736 --> 1:23:49.047
We pick a direction
and we keep walking

1:23:49.071 --> 1:23:50.505
until we find someone, come on.

1:23:50.639 --> 1:23:52.050
I... I can't anymore,
I can't anymore.

1:23:52.074 --> 1:23:53.342
Baby, come on, please.

1:23:53.475 --> 1:23:55.443
I can't, I can't.

1:23:57.013 --> 1:23:58.823
Baby, just a little
further, we gotta keep going.

1:23:58.847 --> 1:23:59.847
- Just hold on.
- Hey.

1:23:59.949 --> 1:24:01.117
My stomach hurts, hold on.

1:24:01.250 --> 1:24:02.250
Look, look, look, look.

1:24:02.351 --> 1:24:03.585
I told you.

1:24:04.186 --> 1:24:05.187
- Help!
- Help!

1:24:05.321 --> 1:24:08.124
- Hey!
- Oh, my god.

1:24:09.557 --> 1:24:10.993
Over here!

1:24:14.230 --> 1:24:16.132
Hey, could you help us out?

1:24:16.564 --> 1:24:17.934
Oh, my god.

1:24:20.602 --> 1:24:22.905
Thank god. Thank god.

1:24:23.039 --> 1:24:25.207
Hey, we could
really use your help, man.

1:24:29.979 --> 1:24:31.713
Hey, could you help us out?

1:24:31.846 --> 1:24:33.548
You won't believe
the night we had...

1:24:33.682 --> 1:24:34.984
- Danny.
- Thank you.

1:24:35.117 --> 1:24:36.352
Danny. No!

1:24:37.719 --> 1:24:39.454
Stop!

1:24:43.359 --> 1:24:46.295
Stop it, stop,
you're hurting him!

1:24:49.065 --> 1:24:50.765
No!

1:24:51.466 --> 1:24:53.002
Danny!

1:24:53.468 --> 1:24:56.604
No, no, no! No!

1:24:56.738 --> 1:24:58.240
- Danny!
- Stop!

1:24:58.374 --> 1:24:59.541
Danny!

1:24:59.674 --> 1:25:02.711
No, no, no. Stop!

1:25:03.611 --> 1:25:04.947
No!

1:25:05.081 --> 1:25:07.149
There, it's going to be okay.

1:25:07.283 --> 1:25:09.151
- What?
- I'm sorry

1:25:09.285 --> 1:25:10.485
it turned out this way.

1:25:10.618 --> 1:25:13.521
No, no, no! No!

1:25:13.655 --> 1:25:16.359
Gently, gently. Gently.

1:25:16.791 --> 1:25:18.928
No!

1:25:20.229 --> 1:25:22.131
No!

1:25:24.133 --> 1:25:27.869
No! No!

1:25:31.873 --> 1:25:34.243
Danny!

1:26:01.037 --> 1:26:03.973
The subject
is a 31-year-old female.

1:26:05.774 --> 1:26:07.776
The c-section is standard.

1:26:37.173 --> 1:26:39.008
Welcome to this cold, new world.

1:26:42.844 --> 1:26:44.947
Do you want to meet our son?

1:26:45.915 --> 1:26:48.050
You want to meet your mommy?
Don't you?
