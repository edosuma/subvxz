00:06.005 --> 00:09.300
[Jacob] I find that if you can...

00:09.384 --> 00:12.470
not change your clothes too often,

00:12.554 --> 00:15.807
and if you don't clutter your life
with, you know, children...

00:16.391 --> 00:19.561
a broad swathe of people of all ages,

00:19.644 --> 00:24.023
you know, will still gravitate
to your existential plight.

00:24.107 --> 00:27.235
If you keep it selfish
and keep it aggravated...

00:27.318 --> 00:28.862
-[woman] Mm-hmm.
-that's timeless.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.822
[all laugh]

00:30.905 --> 00:31.948
Words to live by.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.534
Anything you wanna add
before we let you go?

00:34.617 --> 00:39.664
Yes, I would like everybody to buy
the book... for a second time, even.

00:39.748 --> 00:40.665
Um...

00:41.332 --> 00:43.543
And... No.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.381
Thank you for coming, seriously.

00:48.465 --> 00:52.469
The 20th anniversary edition
of  Conjugality  is out next month,

00:52.552 --> 00:55.597
but you can pre-order it right here
at Quimby's.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.682
Support your local bookstore.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.601
Jacob, thank you so much.

00:59.684 --> 01:01.603
Thank you, Alison.
It's great talking to you.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.104
Thank you.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.532
-"Mention your Twitter!"
-That's my job--

01:14.616 --> 01:17.911
To hold up pads at an event
that your client's doing?

01:17.994 --> 01:20.121
That's the only way
I can reach you, apparently.

01:20.205 --> 01:23.208
I'm just trying to, you know,
close strong with a nice--

01:23.291 --> 01:25.960
You won't even acknowledge social media.
It's insane.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.879
Why is it insane?
I don't wanna do it.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.214
-You really need--
-What's up?

01:29.297 --> 01:32.926
I don't know if you remember me...
Mike from the  Obscurity  reading last year.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.553
-Dude. How are you? Good to see you.
-Good. How are you?

01:35.637 --> 01:37.680
I'm good.
That was an exciting night, right?

01:37.764 --> 01:38.765
[Mike] Yeah. It was crazy.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.308
-[Jacob] Good to see you.
-You too.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.268
-We'd love to have you back.
-I'd love to.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.436
-Thanks a lot.
-Great.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.064
-See, that's a tangible thing--
-Does he follow you on Twitter?

01:46.147 --> 01:47.440
-It doesn't matter.
-I doubt it.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.651
-Did you--
-Do you have any idea--

01:49.734 --> 01:51.694
That guy works at another bookstore

01:51.778 --> 01:54.781
that just offered us a thing to do
in the real world,

01:54.864 --> 01:57.325
and you're like, "Get on Twitter.
Here's my pad!"

01:57.408 --> 02:00.537
I don't think that you're literate
in the language that I'm literate in.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.996
I don't even understand you.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.415
-I know, and that's what--
-Hey. I'm sorry.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.669
-I gotta go, but I just really wanted to--
-Yeah, me too. Let's go.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.129
-I'll see you later, Lauren.
-Yeah.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.381
-[Jacob] Good to see you. Just walk.
-Nice to meet you.

02:11.464 --> 02:12.423
-Jesus.
-Unbelievable.

02:13.049 --> 02:17.595
The online presence
is absolutely necessary these days

02:17.679 --> 02:18.680
to sell anything.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.014
It's got nothing to do with me.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.559
I hope she's not tweeting as me.
That would make me upset.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.395
-She's not tweeting as you.
-I don't like the whole thing.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.730
She's tweeting about the project.
All right?

02:27.814 --> 02:31.317
I didn't call to talk
about social media or Lauren.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.821
-I called to talk about Karen.
-Karen?

02:34.904 --> 02:37.615
I know we spoke about this.
We didn't make a decision on it,

02:37.699 --> 02:41.452
but I really think
that Karen should be contacted--

02:41.536 --> 02:43.997
I haven't even talked to her
in eight years.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.374
I haven't talked to her
in eight years.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.084
If you haven't talked to her
in eight years,

02:48.167 --> 02:49.669
she may have softened somewhat.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.671
That's why she calls me
all the time.

02:53.172 --> 02:54.048
[sighs]

02:54.132 --> 02:56.801
Either way, it's a love story
about the two of you,

02:56.885 --> 02:58.803
and it's missing half of the picture.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.098
I know, that was always her complaint
in the second book.

03:02.181 --> 03:05.685
"How come I'm not in this?"
And, "Who's that other lady?"

03:05.768 --> 03:08.980
Yeah, that happened.
Did you read the second book, Amanda?

03:09.814 --> 03:10.940
Yes, I read it.

03:11.024 --> 03:15.278
But we're focusing on the first one,
so we don't need much from her.

03:15.361 --> 03:20.033
Just even an online little article,
quote, something.

03:20.116 --> 03:21.910
I'll give it to you right now.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.787
Quote, "Jacob Malco is an asshole
who hurt me

03:24.871 --> 03:28.708
and dragged me through it publicly.
Karen, his ex-wife."

03:29.584 --> 03:31.210
That works. I could live with that.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.670
-No. No.
-All right?

03:33.546 --> 03:35.048
This is where I was in January--

03:35.131 --> 03:36.716
-There's no coyotes in Chicago.
-There are!

03:36.799 --> 03:39.219
-I told you, a coyote came--
-You saw a dog.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.262
There's coyotes and everybody knows it.

03:41.346 --> 03:46.684
Look, they want me to reach out to Karen.
I mean, that is-- I can't do that.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.812
-They want me to have her do a blurb.
-Why would they want you to do that?

03:49.896 --> 03:52.315
-Or to do an article...
-Uh-huh.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.109
I can't do that to her.
I put her through enough, number one.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.986
Number two,
there's no way she would do it.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.530
No, but I understand
why they want you to do that.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.116
-Right.
-But I get it, that it's awkward.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.577
But here's the thing. I saw her.
I did see her.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.703
-What?
-I saw her.

04:05.787 --> 04:09.457
[stammers] I was coming
out of, um, Dr. Cath's office.

04:09.540 --> 04:13.169
-You saw Karen?
-Yeah! After my therapy.

04:13.795 --> 04:17.131
-I came out, and she was at that café--
-How many times did you see Karen?

04:17.215 --> 04:19.634
What's that café...
Wait, do you have any coins?

04:19.717 --> 04:20.718
-'Cause I wanna--
-For what?

04:20.802 --> 04:23.096
I'm gonna throw a coin in the fountain
and make a wish.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.681
-Are you five?
-It's a pretty day.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.766
I know, but that's not a wishing well.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.142
-All right--
-Just...

04:28.226 --> 04:32.188
I talk to her, but not a lot.
She knows I'm your friend, so...

04:32.272 --> 04:37.026
But my point is I saw her and I have
her number if you wanted to call her.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.403
What's she doing? How did she look?

04:38.486 --> 04:39.946
Does she have kids? Is she married?

04:40.029 --> 04:41.990
-Where'd you see her?
-I'm sorry. You're upset.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.284
-I'm not upset. Where'd you see her?
-You're upset.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.952
I'm not upset.
Why would you keep saying that?

04:46.035 --> 04:46.953
'Cause you're upset.

04:47.036 --> 04:50.873
-Where'd you see her? [groans]
-Give me a coin. Do you have coins?

04:50.957 --> 04:51.958
I have a nickel.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.459
[gasps]

04:54.502 --> 04:55.503
-Go throw it in.
-Wait.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.088
-No, you gotta--
-Shh!

04:57.171 --> 04:59.674
Make a wish. Just make a wish. Ready?

05:01.426 --> 05:02.802
[coin splashes]

05:03.386 --> 05:05.805
It didn't come true. You threw it.

05:06.472 --> 05:10.268
Yes, I'm excited about the re-release
of the book.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.438
I'm sorry, I've answered
that question a lot today, but--

05:13.521 --> 05:16.399
Uh, okay, Dan, I think we have time
for one more question.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.984
[Dan]  I think that's all I've got.

05:18.067 --> 05:22.822
But I'll just say that I'm a huge fan,
and it's a real pleasure to talk to you.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.699
-Thanks. Appreciate that.
-Great.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.785
Okay, thank you. I'll talk to you soon.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.412
- Thanks a lot.
-Bye.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.831
[Jacob sighs]

05:31.914 --> 05:32.915
Okay.

05:32.999 --> 05:37.503
Um... It looks like we have ten minutes
until your next interview.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.130
-Yeah.
-I don't know if you wanna...

05:39.213 --> 05:40.631
-Can I have a Diet Coke?
-Yes.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.593
-And I'm gonna take a little snooze.
-On that note...

05:43.676 --> 05:45.678
-A little nappy.
-I have Karen's number.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.847
-I'm thinking--
-What did you just say?

05:47.930 --> 05:49.932
-What did you just say?
-Okay. I've--

05:50.016 --> 05:52.351
How did you just present that?
"I have Karen's number."

05:52.435 --> 05:55.605
-Here's what I'm thinking.
-Like in that cute little way, and...

05:55.688 --> 05:57.732
that's not gonna sound
like you're coercing me.

05:57.815 --> 06:01.569
I'm trying to integrate it naturally
into the flow of the conversation.

06:01.652 --> 06:02.653
"I have her number."

06:02.737 --> 06:05.406
What you're saying is,"I'm gonna
call Karen unless you do something."

06:05.490 --> 06:07.575
Are you the same person
I talked to a few days ago,

06:07.658 --> 06:09.911
or do you have a twin
that's equally as irritating?

06:09.994 --> 06:11.954
-I'm an only child.
-No Karen. It's not happening.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.249
Okay. I'm just trying to help.
I guess you don't wanna generate--

06:15.333 --> 06:20.046
Shut up. I can't go through another round
of whatever it is you do.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.799
-Bad idea.
-Okay.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.217
-Red flag for me.
-Okay.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.343
You're seeing a red flag.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.887
Do you know where Everybody's Coffee is?

06:27.970 --> 06:29.514
-Yes.
-Meet me there tomorrow.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.516
I'll text you or e-mail you the time.

06:31.599 --> 06:35.019
This is so stupid,
but I believe that it will prove to you

06:35.103 --> 06:38.898
why this is not a good situation,
and we'll put an end to it.

06:38.981 --> 06:41.275
-Okay.
-I don't think this is a good idea at all.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.652
But we're gonna do it.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.154
We're gonna do it.
You know why? 'Cause you won.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.324
You've annoyed me to the point
where I'm gonna do something stupid.

06:48.407 --> 06:49.617
You're gonna thank me.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.869
-I'm excited. Thank you.
-Can I have a Diet Coke?

06:51.953 --> 06:54.080
-Can I have a Diet Coke?
-You have earned it.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.207
-This is progress.
-All right.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.000
-This feels really good.
-Stop, stop, stop.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.004
-[man] Hey.
-Hi.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.508
-How's it going?
-Can I get a drip?

07:05.591 --> 07:07.677
But do you mind putting it
in a to-go cup today?

07:07.760 --> 07:09.220
-Yeah, sure.
-Thanks.

07:21.732 --> 07:22.650
[Jacob] Karen.

07:22.733 --> 07:23.985
-Oh, my God.
-I know.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.404
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.323
-It's good to see you.
-Yeah.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.784
-Wow. This is wild.
-That is just...

07:31.868 --> 07:34.745
[exhales] I know.
I was just gonna grab some coffee.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.874
Are you taking off?
I didn't even know this place was here.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.710
-Oh.
-What's happening? How are you doing?

07:40.793 --> 07:43.713
Uh... I'm... I'm...

07:45.173 --> 07:46.716
[stammers] I'm fine.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.468
-You look great.
-Yeah. Thanks.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.471
It's so wild, 'cause I've been...
I've been in it.

07:51.554 --> 07:54.640
I've been in us lately,
'cause they're coming out with this...

07:55.892 --> 08:00.980
This anniversary edition of  Conjugality.
Of our book.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.857
And I've just been-- I don't know.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.942
There's supplementary material,
some new stuff,

08:05.026 --> 08:06.235
the cover's a little different.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.738
-And there you are.
-What do you mean, there's new stuff?

08:08.821 --> 08:10.740
-Just drawings.
-Huh?

08:10.823 --> 08:12.283
-No.
-What drawings?

08:12.366 --> 08:14.827
Of you, me... You know, the regular stuff

08:14.911 --> 08:16.412
-from that time.
-New ones?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.789
No, they're not new. From then. From then.

08:18.873 --> 08:22.376
-I have, uh... folders of stuff.
-Wait, ones that weren't in the book?

08:22.460 --> 08:23.961
Right. But from that time.

08:24.045 --> 08:28.007
But they're not--
Why are you upset already?

08:28.090 --> 08:30.676
-I mean, it was 20 years ago.
-I'm not upset.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.345
Oh, it's shocking? It's exciting, though.

08:32.428 --> 08:33.429
No, it's just, um...

08:34.722 --> 08:35.723
All right, well--

08:35.806 --> 08:40.728
Well, listen, before you go, I know
this is crazy, but while you're here,

08:40.811 --> 08:44.899
there's no way that you would maybe write
a blurb or do an interview for the book?

08:44.982 --> 08:47.151
Are you serious right now?

08:47.235 --> 08:49.654
[stammers] Yeah, I'm pretty serious.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.197
-The fuck is happening?
-It's crazy.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.573
-This is crazy.
-I'm sorry.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.742
-What is going on?
-Nothing. I just--

08:54.825 --> 08:56.994
Even a photograph
would be so meaningful to fans.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.622
Why are you talking? Why are you--

08:59.705 --> 09:01.624
-Oh, my God!
-[Lauren] Or a comment,

09:01.707 --> 09:03.709
-if you're more comfortable with that.
-This is so--

09:03.793 --> 09:04.961
What is your fucking prob--

09:05.044 --> 09:08.881
No, no, no. Karen, listen to me.
No, no, no. It's not what you think.

09:08.965 --> 09:09.966
Oh, my God. Okay.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.509
[Jacob] This is exactly what
I thought would happen.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.844
[Karen] You know what? Fuck off!
Go away. Get lost.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.805
This is exactly
what I would think would happen.

09:15.888 --> 09:16.722
-Really?
-[camera shutter clicking]

09:16.806 --> 09:17.807
You're gonna stalk me in a coffee shop?

09:17.890 --> 09:20.226
-No, I just--
-You're gonna ask me to participate?

09:20.309 --> 09:21.936
-Are you high?
-[Jacob] They wanted you to do something.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.938
I said you wouldn't do it,
and I just did it anyways.

09:24.021 --> 09:28.442
-It was stupid, but it's nice to see you.
-You know what? You are a bad man.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.903
-I'm bad? I mean, I'm flawed.
-You are. You're a bad--

09:30.987 --> 09:32.738
You know, you're a bad, bad man.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.241
[Jacob] All right. All right!
Can we do a selfie?

09:35.783 --> 09:37.118
That was really exciting.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.161
Wait, I could...
'Cause I'd be nice to you?

09:39.245 --> 09:40.538
Now we're becoming whole.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.623
Is this your inner self being nice to you?

09:42.707 --> 09:45.793
-Now we're whole. See?
-Yeah. We should do this more often.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.213
I'm just not sexually attracted to you.
[laughs]

09:49.297 --> 09:50.590
That's the thing. I'm sorry.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.843
You're sexually attractive and everything,
but we don't have that...

09:53.926 --> 09:56.345
-We don't have that...
-I think I owe, uh...

09:56.429 --> 09:58.598
I think I owe Karen some sort of...

10:00.391 --> 10:02.977
Like, I think that I need closure.

10:03.644 --> 10:07.148
Do you ever, though, think that
maybe you could've just hung in and...

10:07.231 --> 10:08.441
Yeah, but do you want--

10:08.524 --> 10:11.360
Why do people think that marriage has
to be fun all the time?

10:12.028 --> 10:15.239
Or great all the time?
Maybe it was just in a rough patch.

10:15.323 --> 10:18.284
-I was dying inside.
-Maybe you just felt like you were dying.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.328
How long do rough patches go on for?

10:20.411 --> 10:23.581
Honest to God, when I first sat down here,
you felt like you were dying.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.916
I can't remember what it was
that was bothering you now,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.628
and I'm sure you can't either.
That's what I'm talking about.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.046
-Huh.
-You know, like,

10:30.129 --> 10:32.590
perhaps you had a really great thing,

10:32.673 --> 10:35.801
-and you got impatient, and...
-Yeah, we did...

10:35.885 --> 10:38.596
And all of a sudden,
there's prenatal vitamins in the--

10:38.679 --> 10:41.432
-I don't wanna--
-She was trying to have a baby.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.767
But I-- mnh-mnh.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.812
-You told her you wanted to have a baby.
-No, I did not.

10:46.896 --> 10:50.232
Oh, my God!
That's such a lie that you tell yourself.

10:50.316 --> 10:53.235
You told her that you agreed
to have a child.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.864
[stammers] No, I said,
I wouldn't-- I said maybe.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.866
-Oh, my God.
-But I think the--

10:58.949 --> 11:01.327
But you knew that she wanted to
and you knew--

11:01.410 --> 11:02.662
I thought I could talk her out of it.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.497
You guys were having unprotected sex.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.831
Yeah, but I always do.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.752
It doesn't feel good with the thing on.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.005
Are you 17?

11:14.256 --> 11:17.593
No. But it doesn't feel good with it.

Smashing Pumpkins, the Cubs.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.854
I don't even like baseball.
We went to those games.

12:51.937 --> 12:55.399
It was nice to see you.
It was just nice to see you. Even...

Like, right when I walked in,
before it turned to garbage.

13:01.530 --> 13:04.116

There was a moment right then...

13:05.159 --> 13:08.621
when we saw each other, and I saw you.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.402

I think I need to go over some stuff
with you as a grownup here.

[Karen] Mm-hmm.

14:30.661 --> 14:36.041

14:48.679 --> 14:50.180
[Jacob] You know what I feel bad about?

14:50.264 --> 14:53.976
You know, all that shit was goin' on,
and I was getting successful

14:54.059 --> 14:55.144
and I was going to LA

14:55.227 --> 14:57.479
and that thing started with--
You know...

14:57.563 --> 14:59.481
-My mom?
-No, with Melanie.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.151
-The thing started--
-Oh. Sorry, your affair.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.652
Right, that's what I was gonna say,

15:03.736 --> 15:05.946
is that you were going through that thing
with your mom.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.865
-And I just--
-You can say it.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.199
-She was dying.
-Mm-hmm.

15:13.495 --> 15:17.666
And I just couldn't make time
to be there for that?

15:18.709 --> 15:19.710
No.

15:20.920 --> 15:26.175
[stammers] I mean, l-- Yeah, I'm sorry.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.259
Okay.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.720
Thank you for saying that.

15:29.803 --> 15:33.641
There's gotta be some benefit
to getting old and surviving that shit.

15:33.724 --> 15:37.728
And I'm not expecting you
to let me off the hook, but I--

15:38.312 --> 15:40.689
I wasn't able to feel it then.
I don't know why.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.525
-Fucked up, but I feel it now.
-Yeah.

15:43.609 --> 15:49.782
I mean, I think in some weird way,
in my caretaker-y way,

15:49.865 --> 15:52.660
where I sort of felt like I was put
on the Earth

15:52.743 --> 15:57.539
to make sure you never had to feel
anything, um, too uncomfortable or...

15:58.666 --> 16:01.001
unbearable, that I...

16:01.794 --> 16:03.671
[clears throat] probably...

16:06.632 --> 16:11.428
didn't let you feel
like there were things you could do.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.847
Not that you would've
necessarily known what to do.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.265
-Right.
-But...

16:15.349 --> 16:16.976
But I didn't need to go...

16:17.059 --> 16:18.644
-Have an affair?
-Right.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.272
-And then write a book about it?
-Yeah.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.358
And then... [chuckles]

16:24.441 --> 16:26.235
Do a whole bunch of Q and A's.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.152
Right.

16:27.903 --> 16:31.782
-And a lot of interviews.
-[groans]

16:31.865 --> 16:34.743
-And then marry...
-Right, right.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.412
-the person...
-Yeah, yeah.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.288
And...

16:38.372 --> 16:41.959
-And just justify it.
-[chuckles]

16:42.042 --> 16:44.378
I was completely insensitive.
It was fucked up.

16:44.461 --> 16:47.881
And I didn't know that that's the way
things would pan out.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.009
But you didn't know
things would pan out that way,

16:50.092 --> 16:52.636
and that's the point,
is that I didn't either.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.514
So when you told me you were
having feelings for somebody else,

16:55.597 --> 16:57.141
I mean, I thought that...

16:58.475 --> 16:59.560
It doesn't matter.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.479
-What?
-No, I just thought that we--

17:03.397 --> 17:06.650
I thought it was something that you
were saying you wanted to work through.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.902
-Oh...
-It doesn't...

17:08.986 --> 17:11.155
When I say it doesn't matter, it really...

17:11.238 --> 17:12.239
[laughs] Now it sounds like--

17:12.322 --> 17:14.033
-No, it's fair.
-It really doesn't matter.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.410
-But that's what--
-I had to commit to it.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.995
I didn't think there was any way--

17:18.078 --> 17:21.081
Even if we were to work it out,
how would you ever forgive that?

17:21.165 --> 17:24.168
And I didn't wanna live my whole life
to be this apology

17:24.251 --> 17:28.047
and just, like, end up with kids,
this beaten dude who fucked up,

17:28.130 --> 17:30.132
and his whole life
is now built around that fuck up.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.468
How would you not have punished me for--

17:32.551 --> 17:35.179
So you wanted to end it
because you didn't like the narrative

17:35.262 --> 17:37.389
of being somebody who cheated on his wife?

17:37.931 --> 17:40.809
I obviously liked that narrative.
I wrote a book about it.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.396
But I didn't wanna be the guy
who was still married

17:44.480 --> 17:47.858
and was just this, like, beaten man

17:47.941 --> 17:50.944
who has to spend his whole life living
in this mistake.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.823
I didn't feel like
we could have overcome it.

17:55.699 --> 17:56.950
How's it going?

17:57.034 --> 17:58.577
[both laugh]

18:02.915 --> 18:06.710
All right. Mistakes averted. [laughs]

18:06.794 --> 18:10.380
I agree with you,
and I think you're right in thinking that,

18:10.464 --> 18:14.802
that I did not take into consideration
what you might've been going through

18:14.885 --> 18:16.470
or even your feelings or anything else.

18:16.553 --> 18:20.891
No, but it was to such a degree
that it's almost feels dumb

18:20.974 --> 18:22.851
to apologize for it at this point.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.981
I don't know if it's dumb.
It took me this long to recognize it.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.442
Yeah, but it took me this long
to forget about it.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.527
I know.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.362
[snickers]

18:33.445 --> 18:38.033
The other thing was just, like,
what was I doing? What was I doing?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.702
Was it real? Was it not real?
I don't know.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.288
I don't know
if I'm even capable of the real thing.

18:43.872 --> 18:48.460
Do you think I am? Do you think I was?
Was I-- Did it feel like-- 'Cause we--

18:49.795 --> 18:51.588
And I'm not even sure
how much I processed.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.424
I think I was just too busy
thinking about what'd make a good comic.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.803
Oh, my God. I can't--
[groans] This is so awful.

18:57.886 --> 18:58.887
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.556
-I thought it was going well.
-It was,

19:00.639 --> 19:05.686
and then I just started all of a sudden
to feel like I was just 20 years ago...

19:05.769 --> 19:09.606
-and I'm 25 years old...
-Yeah.

19:09.690 --> 19:13.485
and I'm with this guy
that is eight years my senior

19:13.569 --> 19:16.572
and is supposed to, like, you know...

19:16.655 --> 19:20.325
I just remember spending so much time
trying to understand you,

19:20.409 --> 19:25.956
and I think it was like a full-time job
just trying to understand you

19:26.039 --> 19:28.292
and understand how you tick enough
to take care of you

19:28.375 --> 19:33.213
when no part of you was interested
in taking care of me.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.799
And now here we are.
I'm sitting across from you at a table,

19:35.883 --> 19:38.343
and you're asking me
to take care of you again.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.180
[stammers] And I just--
I'm not-- Like I said, I--

19:42.890 --> 19:44.600
-I get to be the mess now.
-Okay.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.018
You know, I get to be...

19:46.810 --> 19:48.645
I get to be unhinged
if I fucking feel like it.

19:48.729 --> 19:52.274
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.818
But you call me to this table
and you're asking me to...

19:54.902 --> 19:56.111
[stuttering]

19:56.195 --> 19:58.906
I'm just asking you to...
I'm looking for redemption.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.617
I'm looking for forgiveness.
If you don't got it, you don't have to.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.076
-I don't know if I have it.
-Okay.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.786
I didn't know I was supposed to bring it.

20:05.662 --> 20:08.582
You have to warn somebody
about this kind of stuff.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.834
All right, well, we've got dessert.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.295
[laughs]

20:13.378 --> 20:15.005
Oh, my God. This place...

20:15.088 --> 20:16.381
-Right?
-Yeah.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.593
-Right? You're time-traveling, remember?
-Yeah.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.929
-Right?
-The smell brings it back.

20:22.012 --> 20:24.348
When was the last time that you were here?
With me?

20:24.431 --> 20:27.517
-Yeah. Obviously, that's when.
-That's insane. I never come here anymore.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.478
-How's it going, Jeff?
-Good, how are you doing?

20:30.312 --> 20:31.313
What are you having?

20:31.396 --> 20:32.689
Um...

20:33.815 --> 20:35.734
[Jacob] I've been married
a couple times myself.

20:35.817 --> 20:36.818
-You have?
-[Jacob] Yeah, I have.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.112
Did you learn so much from those--

20:39.196 --> 20:43.659
I did, 'cause I really loved
my first wife, and I was just too--

20:43.742 --> 20:44.826
-Oh, you did?
-I did.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.372
I bet you treated her great. Huh?
I bet no regrets there.

20:48.455 --> 20:51.291
-I think I did.
-Yeah, 'cause you loved her so much.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.043
-I did, I loved her so much.
-Yeah.

20:53.126 --> 20:56.421
And then, I got some--
I got crazy. I got--

20:56.505 --> 20:57.798
-Oh, you got crazy?
-I got crazy.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.341
That's what happened?

20:59.424 --> 21:03.887
Yeah, you know, I found some success,
and I thought she was bringing me down

21:03.971 --> 21:07.391
-and then some other stuff happened...
-Oh. Yeah. I mean...

21:07.474 --> 21:09.226
I met someone else and, you know--

21:09.309 --> 21:11.603
-Oh, God. Really?
-Yeah.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.439
-And you just threw it all away?
-I did.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.483
-I threw it all away.
-All right. Well...

21:16.566 --> 21:18.694
I'm sure the second marriage went great,
though, huh?

21:18.777 --> 21:24.199
It didn't. It felt good for a while,
and then it just, uh, kinda got very ugly

21:24.283 --> 21:26.243
-and then, you know, now I'm old.
-Mmm.

21:26.868 --> 21:27.995
Yeah.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.914
What happened with, uh, your guy? He--

21:30.998 --> 21:33.041
Oh, I don't know. He just-- you know...

21:33.125 --> 21:36.253
Long story short.
He left me for another woman,

21:36.336 --> 21:38.046
-Ugh!
-which would have been fine, I guess.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.381
Then he wrote a book about it.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.758
That book went very public,
and a lot of people read it.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.051
-Really? He's a writer?
-Yeah.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.303
So that didn't feel great.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.556
But it must be very exciting
to be with an artist of any kind.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.516
-Yeah, it was very exciting.
-Yeah.

21:49.599 --> 21:53.270
In fact, I have many
happy, happy associations

21:53.353 --> 21:55.188
-with that time. Yeah.
-That's sweet. Right?

21:55.272 --> 21:57.983
-So, maybe it just wasn't meant to be.
-Yeah... You know...

21:58.066 --> 21:59.109
It really wasn't.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.069
[both chuckle]

22:03.071 --> 22:04.781
Oh, God.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.283
-But, you know...
-What?

22:06.366 --> 22:08.368
-We lived, we loved, we laughed.
-Uh-huh.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.537
-And now...
-Yeah.

22:10.620 --> 22:11.872
Do you have a...

22:12.706 --> 22:15.876
What-- so are--
Did you remarry? What happened?

22:16.793 --> 22:19.838
Oh, no, Jacob. I would love to tell you.

22:19.921 --> 22:22.424
-Because it is quite a tale.
-Yeah.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.676
-But I'm afraid...
-What?

22:25.510 --> 22:28.221
-I'm just not gonna tell you about myself.
-What?

22:28.305 --> 22:29.765
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.558
-Not ever?
-Not ever.

22:31.641 --> 22:34.603
Come on. Did you get married again?
Did you meet somebody else?

22:34.686 --> 22:36.104
I did not get married again.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.815
-Oh, kiss me. Come on.
-No, too soon, Jacob!

22:38.899 --> 22:41.026
-Too soon. Bad game.
-God damn.

22:42.486 --> 22:43.487
What do you wanna do?

22:43.570 --> 22:44.863
Do you wanna kiss a little bit?

22:45.989 --> 22:48.283
Oh. [titters]

22:50.952 --> 22:53.121
-I just had a crazy déjà vu.
-[sighs] Wow.

22:53.205 --> 22:57.667
-Did you just have crazy déjà vu? [laughs]
-I just felt it in my whole body.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.961
[guitar playing]

23:26.613 --> 23:29.991
I'm so sad that you lost that battle.
It should have been the cover.

23:30.075 --> 23:33.370
-Yeah, I don't know what--
-Juxtaposition is...

23:33.453 --> 23:34.454
Yeah, it's...

23:34.538 --> 23:37.499
Better. But, yeah,
the other cover is good.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.978
[sighs]

23:59.062 --> 24:01.064
-I gotta go to the bathroom.
-[both chuckle]

24:03.650 --> 24:04.484
[sighs]

24:12.117 --> 24:15.453
[door opens and closes]

24:15.537 --> 24:18.373
-[scoffs]
-[cell phone vibrating]

24:42.480 --> 24:43.815
The fuck?

24:55.118 --> 24:56.369
[toilet flushing]

25:21.603 --> 25:22.729
[swishing]

25:39.663 --> 25:42.165
-[door opens]
-[Jacob] All right.

25:42.916 --> 25:43.917
Sorry...

25:45.126 --> 25:46.836
it took me so long.

25:50.674 --> 25:51.675
Karen?

25:59.182 --> 26:00.183
Karen?

26:40.807 --> 26:44.269
I just can't fucking believe it!
All you did was hurt a person.

26:44.352 --> 26:47.647
That's all you did,
was hurt a person that was already hurt.

26:47.731 --> 26:48.732
Can we get Terry, please?

26:48.815 --> 26:51.568
You're a morally bankrupt fucking monster.

26:51.651 --> 26:52.694
-Okay.
-Publicist.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.529
What do you mean, "Okay," funny face?

26:54.612 --> 26:56.364
-I didn't make a funny face.
-Jesus. Fuck!

26:56.448 --> 26:59.576
Why did you do that?
Why would you fucking do that?

26:59.659 --> 27:03.038
I told you not to do that.
All you did was hurt somebody.

27:03.121 --> 27:05.123
-Terry's here.
-Okay, well... Terry, hi!

27:05.206 --> 27:07.125
-[Terry]  Jacob? Jacob, can you see--
-What?

27:07.208 --> 27:09.377
It's Terry. Jacob, how are you doing?

27:09.461 --> 27:11.880
You don't have to say your name
when you're on the fucking TV.

27:11.963 --> 27:15.675
Well, I can't see you, Jacob.
[stammers]  Can you sit down or something?

27:15.759 --> 27:18.636
-Terry, what the fuck-- What did you do?
-We see you.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.930
-What's the problem?
-These fucking animals,

27:21.014 --> 27:23.641
fucking monster
and her henchman doofus here,

27:23.725 --> 27:27.270
they took those pictures of me and Karen
arguing and put 'em out in the world.

27:27.354 --> 27:30.148
She took 'em behind my back
when I was just standing there.

27:30.231 --> 27:33.109
-I went there to make a point.
-My understanding was you were aware

27:33.193 --> 27:34.736
that the picture was gonna be posted.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.988
Who told you that?
Lying sack of shit here?

27:37.072 --> 27:40.241
On some level, there was knowledge
that something was being done.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.995
-Lauren is a very truthful person, Jacob.
-Wait, what?

27:44.079 --> 27:46.122
You can trust what Lauren tells you.

27:46.206 --> 27:47.290
Are you out of your mind?

27:47.374 --> 27:50.752
She's a publicist! There's no truth there!
It's like a void!

27:50.835 --> 27:52.587
-A moral void.
-Okay... I mean...

27:52.670 --> 27:56.091
[Terry]  She's only trying to do
what's best for the project, Jacob.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.510
I think you might like to know

27:58.593 --> 28:02.806
that pre-sales have gone up
probably 40, 50 times

28:02.889 --> 28:05.183
- [Lauren] Mmm!
-since that picture was posted.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.560
-All right, so, I guess--
-[Amanda]  They're in the top 10%!

28:07.644 --> 28:08.770
What?

28:08.853 --> 28:11.022
They're in the top 10% of sales right now.

28:11.106 --> 28:14.150
[Jacob] Oh, okay,
you guys are a great team.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.570
And the  New York Review of Books
is talking about doing an article.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.989
-All right.
-And the fans are loving it.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.950
-They are eating it all up.
-Of course.

28:22.033 --> 28:25.120
Lauren, did you tell him about Jimmy yet?

28:25.203 --> 28:27.372
-Oh! Oh...
-Jimmy. Who's Jimmy?

28:27.455 --> 28:29.499
"Who's Jimmy?" I don't know. Jimmy Fallon.

28:29.582 --> 28:30.792
-What about Jimmy Fallon?
-Yeah.

28:30.875 --> 28:32.335
-The Tonight Show?
-[Jacob] Uh-huh.

28:32.419 --> 28:35.547
Would you like to be a guest,
do the couch with Jimmy?

28:36.881 --> 28:38.633
-[stammers]
-Yeah, yeah, got it.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.051
-Oh, yeah?
-I got you on. Yeah.

28:40.135 --> 28:42.137
-All right, well, that's--
-[Terry]  On the couch.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.723
On the couch, honey, the couch.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.516
That shirt really brings out your eyes.

28:46.599 --> 28:49.269
Okay! Okay. Can I just say one thing?

28:49.352 --> 28:52.230
I just wanna point out
that this doesn't make it right.

28:52.313 --> 28:55.984
You all hurt someone's feelings.
You're craven. You're all fucking craven.

28:56.067 --> 28:57.152
You too, Terry!

28:57.235 --> 28:59.362
And you too, Himmler. All right?

29:00.071 --> 29:03.700
All right. That said,
did anyone talk to Colbert?

29:03.783 --> 29:06.035
Did anyone reach out to Colbert? Anybody?
