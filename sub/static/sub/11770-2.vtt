A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:14.100 --> 00:17.233
YOU KNOW,
I FOUND MY SOUL MATE.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.633
NOT ONLY DO I THINK
I'M IN LOVE WITH HER,

00:19.667 --> 00:20.700
BUT I THINK
I FOUND THE RIGHT ONE.

00:20.733 --> 00:21.767
REALLY ?

00:21.800 --> 00:22.900
YEAH, DEBRA.

00:22.933 --> 00:24.533
IT'S ONLY A COUPLE OF MONTHS,
IT COULD GO SOUTH.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.267
BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL,
BECAUSE SHE'S...

00:26.300 --> 00:27.567
WHY WOULD IT ?

00:27.600 --> 00:29.967
WELL, WHY HAS IT
FOR MY WHOLE LIFE ?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
BUT SHE,
I THINK--

00:31.033 --> 00:33.833
THIS IS THE ONE.
IS THIS THE ONE ?

00:33.867 --> 00:35.800
NO, NO,
THAT'S NOT A GOOD ONE.

00:35.833 --> 00:36.900
NO, I MEANT DEBRA.

00:36.933 --> 00:40.500
OH, YEAH, IT'S MORE,
IT'S LIKE I LOVE HER SOUL.

00:40.533 --> 00:41.567
MM-HMM.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.700
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I--

00:42.733 --> 00:44.000
HER SOUL.

00:44.033 --> 00:45.367
IT'S NOT JUST LIKE
IT USED TO BE FOR ME,

00:45.400 --> 00:46.400
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
LIKE THE TROPHY.

00:46.433 --> 00:48.233
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT
LOOKS ANYMORE ?

00:48.267 --> 00:50.667
SHE'S ATTRACTIVE,
NO, SHE IS ATTRACTIVE.

00:50.700 --> 00:51.867
BUT YOU DON'T
CARE ABOUT THAT.

00:51.900 --> 00:55.367
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IS,
THE ONLY DOWNSIDE--

00:55.400 --> 00:56.700
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS COLOR ?

00:56.733 --> 00:57.733
I DON'T LIKE...

00:57.767 --> 00:59.367
IT'S TOO FLASHY.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.067
SHE'S A CHRISTIAN
SCIENTIST AND--

01:01.067 --> 01:04.200
SHE'S A WHAT ?

01:04.233 --> 01:05.767
SHE'S A CHRISTIAN
SCIENTIST ?

01:05.800 --> 01:08.100
SHE'S A CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST,
AND I, IT'S...

01:08.133 --> 01:09.600
OH, DEAR.

01:09.633 --> 01:10.633
DID YOU JUST SAY,
"OH, DEAR" ?

01:10.667 --> 01:11.900
YEAH.

01:11.933 --> 01:15.067
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVER
SAID THAT IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.367
NO ONE'S EVER TOLD ME
THEY WERE DATING

01:16.400 --> 01:18.967
A CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST BEFORE,
I'VE BEEN SAVING IT.

01:19.067 --> 01:21.300
IF ANYTHING EVER
CALLED FOR AN "OH, DEAR"--

01:21.333 --> 01:24.467
HOLY COW,
A CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.233
IT'S A NIGHTMARE
FOR ME, BECAUSE,

01:26.267 --> 01:28.600
I'M UNDER THE WEATHER
ABOUT 99% OF MY LIFE,

01:28.633 --> 01:29.633
AND SHE DOESN'T--

01:29.667 --> 01:31.733
SHE WON'T BRING YOU
THE MEDICINE ?

01:31.767 --> 01:32.833
THIS IS
OUT OF THEIR--

01:32.867 --> 01:34.467
I KNOW THEY
CAN'T TAKE IT,

01:34.500 --> 01:36.733
BUT CAN THEY TOUCH IT
AND GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE ?

01:36.767 --> 01:39.533
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
A MEDICINE CHEST IN HER PLACE.

01:39.567 --> 01:40.800
WAIT, ONE SECOND.

01:40.833 --> 01:42.300
DO YOU WANT
SOME MORE TIME, SIR ?

01:42.333 --> 01:43.433
NO, NO, NO,
IT'S FINE.

01:43.467 --> 01:45.967
WHAT, UM, YOU KNOW,
I WANT TO GET ONE OF THESE,

01:46.067 --> 01:47.433
I DON'T HAVE
GOOD LUCK WITH THEM.

01:47.467 --> 01:48.533
THAT'S THE ONE
I HAVE.

01:48.567 --> 01:49.600
YOU LIKE THIS ONE ?

01:49.633 --> 01:50.867
I BOUGHT THAT ONE,
NOT HERE.

01:50.900 --> 01:51.900
OH, YOU'VE GOT
THE SAME ONE ?

01:51.933 --> 01:52.900
YEAH, I LOVE IT.

01:52.933 --> 01:54.100
IT'S A GOOD PHONE,
IT'S AN XR-71.

01:54.133 --> 01:55.600
IT'S A GREAT ONE.

01:55.633 --> 01:58.433
BUT IT DOES GO OUT ON OCCASION,
LIKE IN A TUNNEL OR SOMETHING.

01:58.467 --> 02:00.767
YOU CAN'T HEAR A RADIO
WHEN YOU GO IN A TUNNEL, SO...

02:00.800 --> 02:03.067
YES, YOU CAN, FM.
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

02:03.067 --> 02:04.500
I NEVER LISTEN TO FM.

02:04.533 --> 02:05.600
WHAT DO YOU
LISTEN TO ?

02:05.633 --> 02:08.167
I LISTEN TO TALK.

02:08.200 --> 02:10.600
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PROGRAM,
A LOT OF RINGS IN THAT.

02:10.633 --> 02:12.400
OKAY,
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.767
LISTEN, I MEANT
TO ASK YOU THIS,

02:13.800 --> 02:15.767
I HAVE TO HAND
IN THIS SPECIAL,

02:15.800 --> 02:18.433
AND, YOU KNOW
HOW I LIKE YOU TO WATCH IT.

02:18.467 --> 02:20.833
IT'S NOT LOCKED IN YET,
AND NOW IS THE TIME TO TELL ME

02:20.867 --> 02:24.100
IF YOU THINK SOMETHING'S,
YOU KNOW, CAN YOU WATCH IT ?

02:24.133 --> 02:25.700
WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME OVER

ON FRIDAY NIGHT,

02:25.733 --> 02:28.067
AND WE CAN HAVE DINNER
AND WATCH THE SPECIAL ?

02:28.067 --> 02:29.533
OH, THAT WOULD
BE FANTASTIC.

02:29.567 --> 02:30.700
THAT WOULD BE
PHENOMENAL.

02:30.733 --> 02:31.733
IS THAT GOOD ?

02:31.767 --> 02:33.067
I'D BE IN HEAVEN.

02:33.067 --> 02:34.800
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
SHE'D BE THRILLED.

02:36.167 --> 02:37.133
BRAVO.

02:37.167 --> 02:38.133

02:49.333 --> 02:51.733
YOU'RE MY FIRST CALL.

02:51.767 --> 02:53.933
UM, WHAT ARE

02:53.967 --> 02:55.067

02:55.067 --> 02:58.267
OKAY, GOOD, BECAUSE
RICHARD'S GONNA COME OVER

02:58.300 --> 03:00.067

NEW GIRLFRIEND DEBRA

03:00.067 --> 03:01.900

WATCH HIS SPECIAL.

03:01.933 --> 03:04.933
WAIT, HOW ABOUT THIS ?

03:04.967 --> 03:07.600
WHY DON'T YOU CALL TED DANSON
AND GET THE NUMBER OF RANDY,

03:07.633 --> 03:08.933
THE CHEF FROM
OUR RESTAURANT,

03:08.967 --> 03:11.600
AND HE COULD CATER
THE WHOLE THING.

03:11.633 --> 03:13.133
GREAT IDEA.

03:13.167 --> 03:15.067
AND YOU WORK OUT
WHATEVER THE MONEY IS.

03:15.067 --> 03:17.233
OH, SHE'S ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS,
NO PEANUTS.

03:17.267 --> 03:19.833
AND SHE'S ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS,
SO, NO PEANUTS.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.467
OKAY.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.067
ASK HER IF JEFF COULD COME,
HE HASN'T SEEN THE THING.

03:25.067 --> 03:28.333
OH, AND CAN JEFF COME,
BECAUSE HE HASN'T SEEN IT.

03:29.833 --> 03:31.500
YEAH.

03:31.533 --> 03:34.233
THAT'S RIGHT,
MY FRIENDS FOR A CHANGE.

03:49.467 --> 03:52.067
WELL, DEBRA, I HEARD THAT
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO THE EMMYS.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.067

03:53.100 --> 03:54.167
IS THAT RIGHT ?

03:54.200 --> 03:55.233
SO EXCITED.

03:55.267 --> 03:56.900
ARE YOU EXCITED,
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ?

03:56.933 --> 03:58.867
OH, YEAH,
THAT'S REALLY EXCITING.

03:58.900 --> 04:00.200
IT IS EXCITING.

04:00.233 --> 04:01.800
I HAD A DRESS MADE.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.067
( Cheryl )
YOU HAD IT MADE ?

04:03.100 --> 04:05.933
GORGEOUS, ARMANDO ON BEVERLY,
FITS LIKE A GLOVE.

04:05.967 --> 04:08.733
WE'RE GONNA BE WATCHING IT,
THE EAST COAST FEED.

04:08.767 --> 04:09.967
I'M HAVING
SOME FRIENDS OVER,

04:10.067 --> 04:12.500
SO, MAYBE WE'LL SEE YOU GUYS
WALK DOWN THE RED CARPET.

04:12.533 --> 04:14.633
SHE'S GOT A WHOLE PARTY
PLANNED TO WATCH IT.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.567
DO YOU HAVE KETCHUP ?

04:16.600 --> 04:17.767
WHAT, KETCHUP ?

04:17.800 --> 04:19.067
WHY ?
YEAH.

04:19.067 --> 04:21.933
I CAN'T EAT THE STEAK
WITHOUT SOME KETCHUP.

04:21.967 --> 04:24.467
YOU CAN'T ASK...

04:24.500 --> 04:25.900
RANDY !

04:25.933 --> 04:28.067
CAN I HAVE SOME
KETCHUP PLEASE ?

04:28.100 --> 04:29.467
YOU DON'T ASK
A CHEF FOR KETCHUP.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.167
HE'S RIGHT,
LARRY'S RIGHT.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.400
WHY IS IT INSULTING ?
IT'S KETCHUP.

04:32.433 --> 04:33.467
BECAUSE
IT'S GOOD FOOD.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.967
IT'S LIKE
A TRUCK STOP THING.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.200
OH, THANK YOU
VERY, VERY MUCH.

04:38.233 --> 04:39.600

04:53.133 --> 04:56.200
I AM NEVER HAVING YOU GUYS

04:56.233 --> 04:57.600
( Richard )
WHY, WHAT DID
I DO WRONG ?

04:57.633 --> 05:00.333
( Larry )
IT'S EXHAUSTING,

05:00.367 --> 05:01.967

SO, WHERE'S THIS
HBO SPECIAL ?

05:02.067 --> 05:03.067

WAS THE TOUR BEFORE--

05:05.700 --> 05:08.333

THIS IS ONLY JUST ONE SHOW.

05:08.367 --> 05:09.400
OH, COME ON.

05:09.433 --> 05:12.600
IT'S GREAT,
DON'T EVEN, DON'T EVEN.

05:12.633 --> 05:13.767
( Richard )
I JUST--

05:13.800 --> 05:15.267
( Cheryl )
I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE IT, RICHARD.

05:15.300 --> 05:18.867
( Richard )
TO HAVE YOU GUYS
HERE LIKE THIS IS GREAT.

05:18.900 --> 05:22.333
THESE ARE THE BEST BROWNIES
I HAVE EVER HAD.

05:22.367 --> 05:24.767
( Jeff )
SUZIE MADE THEM,
MY WIFE.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.433
I DROPPED MY DAUGHTER OFF
THIS AFTERNOON,

05:26.467 --> 05:27.667
( static on tv )
BROUGHT US
SOME BROWNIES.

05:27.700 --> 05:30.700
THAT'S A GOOD
SOUND SYSTEM YOU HAVE.

05:35.267 --> 05:36.933
( Cheryl )
WHAT'S HAPPENING,
LARRY ?

05:36.967 --> 05:38.167
SHIT.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.233
WHY DO YOU HAVE
SO MANY REMOTES ?

05:41.267 --> 05:43.567
YEAH, I WISH I HAD
THE ANSWER TO THAT.

05:43.600 --> 05:47.967
WE HAVE THIS GUY, MIKE,
THAT COMES IN

05:48.067 --> 05:49.767
AND, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO
WORK THE TV ANYMORE, HONESTLY.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.867
I DON'T EVEN
WATCH IT ANYMORE.

05:50.900 --> 05:51.900
( Debra )
IT HAS TO BE
ON CHANNEL THREE.

05:51.933 --> 05:53.167
IT'S ON CHANNEL THREE.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.233
EVERY WEEK WE HAVE
THIS GUY COME OVER

05:55.267 --> 05:57.167
AND TRY
TO FIX IT.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.800
YOU KNOW WHAT,
LARRY ?

05:58.833 --> 06:00.133
THE EMMY'S
ARE THIS SUNDAY

06:00.167 --> 06:01.700
AND I AM NOT
GONNA MISS THEM.

06:01.733 --> 06:04.467
WE MISSED HALF THE KNICK GAME
LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THIS SHIT.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.633
YEAH, THIS IS
RIDICULOUS.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.200
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FIRE MIKE.

06:08.233 --> 06:09.300
I'M NOT GONNA
FIRE HIM.

06:09.333 --> 06:10.633
( Jeff )
WHY NOT ?

06:10.667 --> 06:12.100
I DON'T KNOW, HE'S BLACK,
I DON'T WANT TO FIRE HIM.

06:12.133 --> 06:13.633
YOU DON'T WANT TO
FIRE A BLACK GUY ?

06:13.667 --> 06:16.067
NO, I DON'T,
I DON'T WANT TO FIRE HIM.

06:16.067 --> 06:17.233
IT'S SO
RIDICULOUS !

06:17.267 --> 06:19.200
WHO CARES WHAT HE IS,
IF HE SUCKS, HE SUCKS.

06:19.233 --> 06:20.733
WELL, HE COULD
COME IN AND FIX IT--

06:20.767 --> 06:23.733
EVERY WEEK HE COMES IN,
HE NEVER FIXES IT.

06:23.767 --> 06:25.500
WE CAN'T EVEN
WATCH HIS SPECIAL ?

06:25.533 --> 06:27.200
THAT'S RIDICULOUS !

06:27.233 --> 06:28.600
FIRE YOUR GUY,
I GOT A GOOD GUY.

06:28.633 --> 06:29.767
LARRY, WILL YOU
FIX THIS PLEASE ?

06:29.800 --> 06:30.967
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THIS.

06:31.067 --> 06:32.833
LOOK, HEY,
I TRIED EVERY REMOTE,

06:32.867 --> 06:34.933
AND NONE
OF THEM WORK, LOOK !

06:34.967 --> 06:36.367
SO FUCKING
IDIOTIC TO HAVE--

06:36.400 --> 06:39.167
YOU SHOULD HAVE
ONE GODDAMN REMOTE AND--

06:39.200 --> 06:40.567
WE SHOULD
HAVE ONE REMOTE !

06:40.600 --> 06:42.333
YOU NEED
TO CALL HIM, LARRY.

06:42.367 --> 06:45.200
ARE YOU
GONNA CALL HIM ?

06:45.233 --> 06:46.900
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
PLAY SCRABBLE.

06:46.933 --> 06:48.567
NOTHING
WE CAN DO.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.067
THAT'S A BAD JOKE,
RIGHT ?

06:50.067 --> 06:51.500
YEAH, IT IS A JOKE,
I MEAN, I DON'T--

06:51.533 --> 06:53.200
SCRABBLE ?

06:53.233 --> 06:55.067
IT'S A JOKE, BUT WHAT
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO ?

06:55.067 --> 06:56.367
YOU WANT TO
SIT SHIVA ?

06:56.400 --> 06:58.500
WHY DON'T WE JUST PLAY TWISTER,
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY ?

06:58.533 --> 07:00.533
IF THIS WAS YOUR SHOW,
THEN YOU WOULD,

07:00.567 --> 07:01.833
YOU WOULD MAKE
EVERY FUCKING PLAN--

07:01.867 --> 07:03.800
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS

07:03.833 --> 07:06.300
AND ALL GET UNDER
THE COVERS AND SOB.

07:06.333 --> 07:07.767
WHY DON'T WE JUST GO TO MY HOUSE
AND WATCH IT, FOR CHRISSAKE ?

07:07.800 --> 07:08.800
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT ?

07:08.833 --> 07:09.833
( Jeff )
I'LL GO TO YOUR HOUSE.

07:09.867 --> 07:11.067
THANK YOU.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.667
THE WHOLE REASON FOR THE NIGHT
WAS TO WATCH YOUR THING.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.100
ALRIGHT, FINE,
WE'LL GO TO YOUR HOUSE.

07:16.133 --> 07:17.400
I'LL PACK THESE
BROWNIES UP--

07:17.433 --> 07:19.367
I DON'T
FEEL WELL.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.667
WHAT ?

07:20.700 --> 07:23.167
I REALLY DON'T FEEL WELL,
I DON'T THINK I CAN GO.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.400
YOU DON'T FEEL WELL ?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

07:24.433 --> 07:25.633
I'D LIKE TO GO HOME,
I THINK.

07:25.667 --> 07:26.700
YOU FEEL
PERFECTLY--

07:26.733 --> 07:29.067
YOU'RE ALMOST COLD
LIKE A CORPSE.

07:29.067 --> 07:30.533
DO YOU WANT
AN ASPIRIN ?

07:30.567 --> 07:33.067
NO, I CAN'T TAKE AN ASPIRIN,
BUT, THANK YOU.

07:33.067 --> 07:34.067
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?

07:34.100 --> 07:36.300
UM, I DON'T--

07:36.333 --> 07:39.067
ANY PEANUTS
IN THE BROWNIES ?

07:39.067 --> 07:40.200
NO, NO WAY,
I DON'T LIKE PEANUTS

07:40.233 --> 07:41.333
AND MY WIFE
NEVER USES THEM.

07:41.367 --> 07:42.667
( Richard )
I WOULDN'T ALLOW
THAT TO HAPPEN.

07:42.700 --> 07:43.867
I ATE SO MANY
OF THOSE.

07:43.900 --> 07:45.833
AND THERE WAS NO
PEANUTS OR PEANUT OIL

07:45.867 --> 07:47.433
OR ANYTHING
IN THE DINNER.

07:47.467 --> 07:51.167
YOU TOLD RANDY NOT--
THAT SHE'S ALLERGIC, RIGHT ?

07:51.200 --> 07:53.233
WHAT ?

07:53.267 --> 07:55.167
( Larry )
I TOLD YOU
ON THE PHONE.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.067
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
ON THE PHONE.

07:57.067 --> 07:59.633
I TOLD YOU WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU
ON THE PHONE THAT--

07:59.667 --> 08:00.933
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

08:00.967 --> 08:02.067
( Debra )
OH...

08:02.067 --> 08:03.067
WHAT,
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

08:03.067 --> 08:04.500
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

08:04.533 --> 08:05.967
HE DID, I WAS STANDING RIGHT
NEXT TO HIM WHEN HE CALLED YOU.

08:06.067 --> 08:10.567
I DIDN'T HEAR IT,
YOU NEVER SAID IT
OR I DIDN'T HEAR IT.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.300
I'LL BET
THE CELL PHONE.

08:12.333 --> 08:14.800
I BET THERE WAS INTERFERENCE
ON THE CELL PHONE.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.100
THEY HAVE DROP OUTS
ALL THE TIME.

08:16.133 --> 08:17.867
JESUS CHRIST,
I KNEW YOU FUCKED IT UP.

08:17.900 --> 08:19.067
I FUCKED IT UP ?!

08:19.067 --> 08:21.067
WHAT KIND OF STUPID THING
IS THAT TO SAY ?

08:21.067 --> 08:22.133
I FUCKED IT UP.

08:22.167 --> 08:23.267
YOU FUCKED IT UP !

08:23.300 --> 08:24.267
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE
A GODDAMN CELL PHONE !

08:24.300 --> 08:25.400
IT WAS A SHIT
CELL PHONE.

08:25.433 --> 08:26.467
OKAY,
DEBRA IS SICK !

08:26.500 --> 08:29.067
A PRAYING MANTIS
CAN USE THAT GODDAMN PHONE !

08:29.100 --> 08:30.967
I'D REALLY LIKE
TO GO HOME.

08:31.067 --> 08:34.300
ALL I CAN DO REALLY
IS WAIT IT OUT.

08:34.333 --> 08:35.800
I AM SO SORRY.

08:35.833 --> 08:36.833
YOU SHOULD--

08:36.867 --> 08:38.867
WHY DON'T
WE JUST GO HOME

08:38.900 --> 08:40.567
AND, CAN'T YOU JUST,
LIKE, TAKE A NAP,

08:40.600 --> 08:42.400
AND WE CAN ALL
WATCH IT AT MY HOUSE ?

08:42.433 --> 08:43.667
YOU COULD
TAKE A NAP.

08:43.700 --> 08:45.067
OR WHY DON'T--

08:45.067 --> 08:47.333
I'D LIKE YOU
TO TAKE ME HOME.

08:47.367 --> 08:49.300
SHE NEEDS
TO GO HOME, RICHARD.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.333
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS REALLY--

08:50.367 --> 08:51.467
THANK YOU.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.867
I AM SO SORRY, DEBRA,
I NEVER GOT THAT--

08:53.900 --> 08:54.967
WHAT A SHAME.

08:55.067 --> 08:55.967
I FEEL VERY AWKWARD
ABOUT IT.

08:56.067 --> 08:58.900
WE CAN'T EVEN GET
TO WATCH THE SPECIAL.

08:58.933 --> 09:00.200
I GET HOME
AND I'LL BE FINE.

09:00.233 --> 09:01.700
WHAT ABOUT, YOU WANT TO
JUST DRIVE HOME ?

09:01.733 --> 09:03.833
I DON'T REALLY FEEL
COMFORTABLE DRIVING MYSELF.

09:03.867 --> 09:05.400
SHE NEEDS YOU
TO TAKE HER HOME.

09:05.433 --> 09:06.433
YOU KNOW ?
I MEAN...

09:06.467 --> 09:07.467
( Debra )
NOW.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.667
ALRIGHT,
WE'RE GOING.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.967
YOU'RE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT,
HOW CAN YOU DO THIS ?

09:11.067 --> 09:13.067
SHE'S NOT LOOKING WELL,
I'M SO--

09:13.067 --> 09:14.467
CELL PHONE,

09:14.500 --> 09:16.700
( Larry )
YEAH, WELL, WE'LL WATCH IT,
DON'T WORRY.

09:16.733 --> 09:18.567
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.567
SCRABBLE ?

09:19.600 --> 09:20.967
I'D LOVE
TO PLAY SCRABBLE.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.400
I SAID IT AND I KINDA
GOT IN THE MOOD.

09:22.433 --> 09:23.500
LET'S GET IT.

09:23.533 --> 09:24.567
REALLY,
YOU WANT TO PLAY ?

09:24.600 --> 09:25.700
I'M ALL OVER IT,
LET'S GO.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.367
ABSOLUTELY,
OKAY.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.167
YOU DON'T NEED TO PLAY,
IT'S BETTER WITH TWO.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.900
DO YOU HAVE
ANY MILK ?

09:34.733 --> 09:37.867
I'M SORRY,
BUT I GOT FIVE REMOTES,
NOTHING'S WORKING.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.467
JUST BE HONEST, MAN,
'CAUSE I'M BLACK, RIGHT ?

09:40.500 --> 09:41.833
RIGHT ?

09:41.867 --> 09:43.067
WHY ?

09:43.067 --> 09:44.500
THAT COULDN'T
BE CRAZIER.

09:44.533 --> 09:45.967
CRAZY,
WHY DID I HIRE YOU ?

09:46.067 --> 09:47.067
THAT WAS OVER
THE PHONE, MAN.

09:47.100 --> 09:51.133
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS BLACK AT THE TIME.

09:51.167 --> 09:53.867
ALRIGHT, THAT'S TRUE,
BUT, I KEPT YOU AROUND.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.900
BUT YOU'RE GETTING
RID OF ME, RIGHT ?

09:55.933 --> 09:57.800
I FIRE WHITE PEOPLE,
I FIRED WHITE PEOPLE.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.333
I HAVE FIRED
PLENTY OF WHITE PEOPLE.

09:59.367 --> 10:01.367
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
15 YEARS, ALRIGHT ?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.033
OKAY, OKAY.

10:03.067 --> 10:04.767
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
IT'S NOT EVEN ME.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.167
CAN I BE-- ?
OKAY.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.133
YOU WANT IT,
CAN WE BE HONEST HERE ?

10:09.167 --> 10:11.633
OKAY, LET'S BE HONEST,
OKAY ?

10:13.867 --> 10:16.233
IT'S MY WIFE,
SHE WANTS--

10:16.267 --> 10:17.500
OH, DUDE.

10:17.533 --> 10:18.567
NO, SERIOUSLY.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.733
PLEASE DON'T
GO THERE, MAN.

10:19.767 --> 10:23.133
NO, BE MAN ENOUGH.

10:23.167 --> 10:24.133
BE MAN ENOUGH.

10:24.167 --> 10:26.000
IF YOU GONNA BE A RACIST,
BE A MAN, MAN.

10:26.033 --> 10:27.067
I WAS A MAN.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.333
I WAS A MAN,
WHAT GOOD DID IT DO ME ?

10:28.367 --> 10:29.567
GO BLAME IT
ON YOUR WIFE,
THANK YOU.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.233
YOU'RE BLAMING IT ON YOUR RACE,
WHAT'S WORSE ?

10:32.267 --> 10:34.400
I'D RATHER BLAME IT ON MY WIFE
THAN BLAME IT ON MY RACE.

10:34.433 --> 10:35.800
RIGHT, WHATEVER.

10:35.833 --> 10:38.100
C'MON, DON'T TAKE IT,
DON'T BE LIKE THAT.

10:38.133 --> 10:39.300
I GOT THIS.

10:39.333 --> 10:40.333
I GOT THE TIP.

10:40.367 --> 10:41.333
THAT'S OKAY,
I GOT THE TIP.

10:41.367 --> 10:42.500
I GOT THE TIP, MAN.

10:42.533 --> 10:44.500
OKAY, DON'T, DON'T,
DON'T, DON'T BE MAD.

10:44.533 --> 10:48.067
C'MON, DON'T,
COME ON, MIKE.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.133
I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
BE MAD ABOUT IT.

10:50.167 --> 10:51.833
I'M GONNA RECOMMEND YOU
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

10:51.867 --> 10:52.900
WHATEVER.

10:52.933 --> 10:54.667
I WILL,
I'LL RECOMMEND YOU.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.800
HEY, WANDA.

11:29.800 --> 11:30.833

11:34.700 --> 11:35.667
OH, HELLO.

11:35.700 --> 11:36.700

11:36.733 --> 11:37.800
ARE YOU HERE
FOR THE PRAYER GROUP ?

11:37.833 --> 11:39.167
NO, I'M NOT.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.400
OH.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.200
I'M ACTUALLY HERE
TO SEE DEBRA.

11:42.233 --> 11:45.100
OH, UNFORTUNATELY SHE'S
A LITTLE UNDER THE WEATHER.

11:45.133 --> 11:47.767
I KNOW, UM,

11:47.800 --> 11:50.100
SHE ACTUALLY ATE
THE PEANUTS IN MY HOUSE.

11:50.133 --> 11:51.267
OH, I KNOW
ALL ABOUT YOU.

11:51.300 --> 11:52.900
HELLO,
I'M DEBRA'S MOTHER.

11:52.933 --> 11:53.933
OH, HI,
I'M LARRY.

11:53.967 --> 11:55.500
I KNOW.

11:55.533 --> 11:57.067
I FEEL TERRIBLE
ABOUT THIS.

11:57.067 --> 11:58.367
OH, NO, NO,
DON'T.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.967
WE'RE ALL RESPONSIBLE
FOR OUR OWN LIVES.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.067
I THINK THERE'S
SOME TRUTH TO THAT.

12:04.067 --> 12:04.967
COME.

12:06.967 --> 12:09.700
RIGHT THIS WAY.

12:09.733 --> 12:11.800
THIS IS
OUR PRAYER GROUP.

12:11.833 --> 12:13.933
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO JOIN US AFTERWARDS.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.700
OH, OKAY.

12:15.733 --> 12:17.067
UM, LET'S SEE
HOW I'M DOING ON TIME.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.167
OKAY.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.500
AND DEBRA'S
RIGHT IN THERE.

12:31.067 --> 12:33.400
( Debra )
I'LL BE FINE
TO GO TO THE EMMY'S.

12:33.433 --> 12:35.933
( Richard )
C'MON, LOOK AT YOU.

12:35.967 --> 12:37.900
YOU'RE LIPS ARE
LIKE BALLOONS.

12:37.933 --> 12:39.067
HI, LARRY.

12:39.067 --> 12:41.067
HI, LARRY, SHE THINKS
SHE CAN GO TOMORROW NIGHT.

12:41.067 --> 12:42.067
YOU BELIEVE
THIS SHIT ?

12:42.100 --> 12:43.567
OH, MY GOSH.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.667
( Debra )
WILL YOU TELL HIM,
IT'S NOT THAT BAD, IS IT ?

12:46.700 --> 12:49.200
CAN YOU SEE
OUT OF THAT EYE ?

12:49.233 --> 12:50.967
( Debra )
I CAN SEE,
OF COURSE I CAN SEE.

12:51.067 --> 12:54.300
HONEY, THEY'RE BULGING ALMOST,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, HON.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.433
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT THE PEANUTS

12:56.467 --> 12:57.967
AND THE WHOLE
THING THERE.

12:58.067 --> 13:00.267
YOU KNOW, I HAD
THIS NEW CELL PHONE,

13:00.300 --> 13:01.300
AND IT JUST--
IT DIDN'T.

13:01.333 --> 13:02.900
YEAH,
NO, REALLY.

13:02.933 --> 13:05.967
I THINK IT WAS MORE PEANUTS
THAN THE CELL.

13:06.067 --> 13:08.100
HE RECOMMENDED
THIS PHONE TO ME.

13:08.133 --> 13:09.400
THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT,
LOOK AT HER.

13:09.433 --> 13:11.833
AND SHE THINKS SHE CAN
GO TO THE AWARDS.

13:11.867 --> 13:13.600
( Debra )
I'LL BE FINE
BY TOMORROW NIGHT.

13:13.633 --> 13:15.400
( Richard )
HE'S A SENSIBLE MAN,
ON OCCASION.

13:15.433 --> 13:17.500
I'LL BE FINE, SWEETIE,
I'LL BE FINE.

13:17.533 --> 13:19.067
HONEY, YOU DON'T--

13:19.067 --> 13:20.067
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GO.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.067
HE'S RIGHT.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.300
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
SHOULD THINK ABOUT ?

13:22.333 --> 13:26.167
YOU SHOULD JUST TAKE,
UH, YOU KNOW, BENADRYL.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.467
YOU'D KNOCK THAT OUT
IN FIVE MINUTES.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.200
THE WHOLE THING
WOULD BE GONE.

13:30.233 --> 13:31.467
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.733
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.

13:32.767 --> 13:33.900
( Debra )
I DON'T TAKE MEDICATION.

13:33.933 --> 13:34.900
POP IT IN.

13:34.933 --> 13:35.900
NO, POP IT IN ?

13:35.933 --> 13:36.900
( Richard )
WHO'S GONNA KNOW ?

13:36.933 --> 13:37.933
POP IT IN ?

13:37.967 --> 13:39.067
THAT'S A BETRAYAL
OF MY FAITH.

13:39.067 --> 13:40.800
JESUS WOULD BE
VERY HAPPY FOR YOU

13:40.833 --> 13:42.300
TO LOOK BETTER
THAN YOU DO NOW.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.933
NO ONE'S WATCHING, POP,
TAKE A POP.

13:44.967 --> 13:47.400
( Debra )
LISTEN, I HAVE SPENT
MY ENTIRE LIFE

13:47.433 --> 13:49.067
AND BELIEF AND FAITH.

13:49.067 --> 13:51.767
WELL, WHY NOT
JUST PRAY FOR THE TV ?

13:51.800 --> 13:54.233
WHY EVEN HAVE SOMEBODY COME IN
AND DO, FIX THE TELEVISION ?

13:54.267 --> 13:55.800
WHY NOT JUST PRAY ?

13:55.833 --> 13:58.800
PRAY FOR THE TV ?
WHAT IS THAT ?

13:58.833 --> 14:00.400
WHAT ?

14:00.433 --> 14:02.433
HEY, BY THE WAY,
IS THAT GUY ANY GOOD ?

14:02.467 --> 14:06.067
( Debra )
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S MY PARENTS' HOUSE.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.900
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
WE GOT ALL SORTS OF PROBLEM,

14:07.933 --> 14:09.833
YOU WERE THERE THE OTHER NIGHT,
WITH ALL THOSE REMOTES,

14:09.867 --> 14:11.267
AND CHERYL,
IT'S A PAIN IN THE NECK.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.900
I JUST HAD TO FIRE OUR GUY,
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY NEW.

14:13.933 --> 14:15.067
I'D LIKE TO JUST
GET ONE REMOTE

14:15.100 --> 14:16.467
THAT COULD TAKE CARE
OF THE WHOLE THING.

14:16.500 --> 14:19.067
I DON'T KNOW
IF HE'S GOOD, LARRY,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK HIM...

14:19.067 --> 14:20.067
ON YOUR WAY OUT.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.767
DO YOU HAVE ONE REMOTE,
OR TWO ?

14:22.800 --> 14:24.433
OH, RICHARD.

14:28.700 --> 14:31.200
OH, LARRY,
COME.

14:31.233 --> 14:32.333
JUST IN TIME,

14:32.367 --> 14:33.667
WE'RE ABOUT TO BEGIN
THE PRAYER CIRCLE.

14:33.700 --> 14:34.733
YOU'VE GOTTA
BE KIDDING, NO.

14:34.767 --> 14:35.733
YES.

14:35.767 --> 14:37.100
YOU DON'T WANT ME
IN THIS THING.

14:37.133 --> 14:38.600
SHE'LL WIND UP
WITH TUBERCULOSIS.

14:38.633 --> 14:39.933
I REALLY GOT BAD KARMA,
I'M NOT KIDDING.

14:39.967 --> 14:41.367
OH, YES,
WE DO.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.867
I BEG TO DIFFER.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.267
GRAB HANDS.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.300
LET US JOIN HANDS.

14:45.333 --> 14:46.667

14:51.067 --> 14:52.200
PUT HER OVER HERE.

14:52.233 --> 14:55.300

WITH HER HUSBAND.

14:58.833 --> 15:02.767
AND AS WE CONTINUE
THIS HEALING LIGHT,

15:02.800 --> 15:04.067
WE KNOW, JESUS,

15:04.100 --> 15:08.600

AND YOU ARE ALWAYS WITH US,

15:08.633 --> 15:11.867
FOR THINE IS THE POWER,
AND THE GLORY,

15:11.900 --> 15:14.200
FOREVER AND EVER.

15:14.233 --> 15:16.633
NO ONE
CAN TOUCH US,

15:16.667 --> 15:19.767
( phone ringing )
FOR GOD
IS ALWAYS WITH US.

15:19.800 --> 15:20.867
OH, CELL PHONE.

15:22.067 --> 15:23.567
I'M SORRY.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.300

15:28.400 --> 15:30.067
OH, HEY.

15:30.067 --> 15:31.100
MAYBE.

15:31.133 --> 15:32.333
WHO ARE
THEY PLAYING ?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.533
I'M GONNA
BE HUMILIATED.

15:35.567 --> 15:37.200
THIS IS
A FUCKING NIGHTMARE.

15:37.233 --> 15:39.400
AND YOU KNOW WHY
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE ?

15:39.433 --> 15:40.533
ME ?
YOU,
MY FRIEND.

15:40.567 --> 15:41.933
YES, YES, YOU,

15:41.967 --> 15:43.933
BECAUSE OF THIS
FUCKING HIGHFALUTIN',

15:43.967 --> 15:46.567
YOU GOTTA GO,
JOIN A RESTAURANT,
HAVE AN INTEREST,

15:46.600 --> 15:48.733
HAVE THEM COME OVER
AND COOK PEANUT SAUCE.

15:48.767 --> 15:49.733
HEY.

15:49.767 --> 15:51.633
IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

15:51.667 --> 15:52.967
IF IT WASN'T
FOR THE PEANUTS,

15:53.067 --> 15:54.333
THEN SHE WOULDN'T LOOK LIKE
A GODDAMN FUCKING VENETIAN !

15:54.367 --> 15:56.067
THE CELL PHONE THAT YOU
RECOMMENDED DIDN'T WORK !

15:56.067 --> 15:58.200
THAT CELL PHONE IS USED
BY EVERY FUCKING PERSON

15:58.233 --> 15:59.200
ON THE GODDAMN PLANET.

15:59.233 --> 16:00.433
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:00.467 --> 16:01.833
DID YOU SEE
MY GIRLFRIEND ?

16:01.867 --> 16:04.600
WELL, YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT THE WAY SHE LOOKS.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.600
WOULD YOU
SHOW UP AT AN EVENT ?

16:09.633 --> 16:11.067
WOULD I ?

16:11.067 --> 16:13.867
WITH A PERSON THAT LOOKS LIKE
SHE HAS A MACARONI SALAD-- ?

16:13.900 --> 16:16.200
... ABOUT THE SOUL,
YOU LOVE HER SOUL.

16:16.233 --> 16:18.100
PART OF THAT IS TRUE,
BUT, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE,

16:18.133 --> 16:19.467
I HAVE TO,
YOU KNOW,

16:19.500 --> 16:20.467
WHAT KIND OF
FUCKING--

16:20.500 --> 16:21.667
WHY CAN'T SHE
TAKE A BENADRYL ?

16:21.700 --> 16:23.167
THESE PEOPLE,
WHAT ARE THEY DOING ?

16:23.200 --> 16:24.600
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THIS ATTITUDE.

16:24.633 --> 16:26.267
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT EITHER.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.400
TAKE A BENADRYL.

16:27.433 --> 16:29.067
SHE'LL BE BETTER
IN FIVE MINUTES.

16:29.067 --> 16:31.300
CAN YOU IMAGINE ME
GETTING OUT OF THE LIMO
WITH MY DATE ?

16:31.333 --> 16:33.200
SHE'S PRETTY
HELLBENT ON GOING TOO.

16:33.233 --> 16:35.533
SHE'S GOT THE DRESS,
"I GOT THE DRESS".

16:35.567 --> 16:36.867
YOU KNOW, I KNOW,
I KNOW, I KNOW.

16:36.900 --> 16:37.967
SHE'S READY.

16:38.067 --> 16:39.367
YEAH, KNOW WHAT WOULD
MATCH HER HEAD ?

16:39.400 --> 16:42.100
A DRESS MADE OF,
YOU KNOW, TURNIPS AND BLOOD.

16:42.133 --> 16:44.133
YOU KNOW ?

16:44.167 --> 16:45.567
OH, GOD,
SHE'S SO HIDEOUS.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.233
SHE SHOULD
LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.367
DOES SHE EVEN KNOW
WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE ?

16:48.400 --> 16:49.500
SHE DENIES IT.

16:49.533 --> 16:51.167
IT'S LIKE ALL,
IT'S A DENIAL THING.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.633
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE HER ?
IT'LL BE FUN.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.733
OH, THAT'S VERY,
OH, YEAH, MR. BIG SHOT.

16:54.767 --> 16:56.067
WHY DON'T
YOU TAKE HER ?

16:56.067 --> 16:57.333
YEAH, WHAT DO WE DO ?
YOU GOTTA HELP ME OUT.

16:57.367 --> 17:00.633
YOU GOTTA GET A SHOT
AND STICK IT IN HER ASS--

17:00.667 --> 17:02.300
SHE'S NOT
A RACE HORSE.

17:02.333 --> 17:03.567
YOU GOTTA GET
A SHOT OF BENADRYL,

17:03.600 --> 17:05.767
WHILE SHE'S SLEEPING,
OR SHOVE IT DOWN HER THROAT.

17:05.800 --> 17:06.833
LIKE A HIT MAN ?

17:06.867 --> 17:08.367
A BENADRYL
HIT MAN ?

17:08.400 --> 17:10.867
PUT IT IN THE BROWNIE
THAT SHE ATE.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.467
WAIT A MINUTE,
WHY NOT PUT IT IN ?

17:12.500 --> 17:14.600
WHY NOT PUT IT
IN THE BROWNIE ?

17:14.633 --> 17:16.167
THAT'S A FUCKING
BRILLIANT IDEA.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.267
A BRILLIANT IDEA ?

17:17.300 --> 17:18.967
YEAH, BECAUSE,
YEAH, IT'S A FUCKING-- !

17:19.067 --> 17:20.267
WHAT,
THE BENADRYL BROWNIE ?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.500
NO, FIRST OF ALL, IT WILL BE,
SHE WILL NEVER KNOW.

17:22.533 --> 17:24.433
I'VE GOT
NEWS FOR YOU.

17:24.467 --> 17:25.833
EVEN IF SHE
GOT BETTER,

17:25.867 --> 17:28.267
THEY WOULD THINK
IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE PRAYER.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.267
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.267
WELL, I MEAN,
YOU COULD DO IT,
IT WOULDN'T BE HARD--

17:31.300 --> 17:33.567
WHAT, THEY GONNA
THROW ME IN PRISON ?

17:33.600 --> 17:37.500
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GET
THE RECIPE FROM SUZIE,

17:37.533 --> 17:39.233
AND CHERYL WOULD BAKE THEM,
PUT IT IN,

17:39.267 --> 17:41.500
WE'D JUST GIVE HER
THE BROWNIE.

17:45.067 --> 17:46.933
LARRY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

17:46.967 --> 17:48.300
HEY, YOU GOT
A DOG.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.967
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE NEED PROTECTION,

17:50.067 --> 17:52.467
IT'S JUST ME AND SAMMY
IN THE HOUSE ALONE.

17:52.500 --> 17:53.733
HE'S A GOOD BOY,
THIS IS OSCAR.

17:53.767 --> 17:55.833
OSCAR !
OSKEE BOY !

17:55.867 --> 17:56.900
HEY, OSKEE BOY !

17:56.933 --> 17:57.967
DON'T GET HIM
EXCITED, OKAY ?

17:58.067 --> 17:59.600
OKAY.
YEAH.

17:59.633 --> 18:01.733
WHAT, YOU JUST STOP BY,
YOU DON'T CALL ?

18:01.767 --> 18:03.367
NO, I TRIED TO CALL,

18:03.400 --> 18:04.867
BUT MY CELL PHONE
COULDN'T GET THROUGH.

18:04.900 --> 18:05.900
INTERFERENCE.

18:05.933 --> 18:07.267
THAT'S A PIECE OF CRAP,
THAT ONE.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.533
I HAD THAT ONE,
I GOT RID OF IT.

18:08.567 --> 18:09.733
REALLY ?

18:09.767 --> 18:11.567
WHO'S THAT, ISN'T THAT
SOMEBODY IN THE CAR ?

18:11.600 --> 18:13.200
OH, IT'S RICHARD,
RICHARD LEWIS.

18:13.233 --> 18:15.300
OH, OH.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.667
SO, WHAT ?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

18:17.700 --> 18:21.900
ACTUALLY, THIS MAY SOUND
A LITTLE STRANGE, BUT,

18:21.933 --> 18:23.967
WE HAD A DINNER PARTY
THE OTHER NIGHT

18:24.067 --> 18:26.067
AND, JEFF BROUGHT OVER
SOME OF YOUR BROWNIES--

18:26.100 --> 18:28.633
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:28.667 --> 18:32.267
JEFF BROUGHT BROWNIES
THAT I MADE TO A DINNER PARTY ?

18:32.300 --> 18:33.667
YEAH,
AT MY HOUSE.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.800
LARRY, I BAKED
THOSE BROWNIES

18:35.833 --> 18:38.767
SPECIFICALLY FOR SAMMY
TO TAKE TO SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY,

18:38.800 --> 18:39.867
AND THEY WERE GONE.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.933
I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED.

18:41.967 --> 18:43.400
JEFF STOLE--

18:43.433 --> 18:46.067
HE STOLE HIS CHILD'S
BROWNIES, LARRY.

18:46.067 --> 18:47.600
YOU SEE WHAT WE'RE
DEALING WITH HERE ?

18:47.633 --> 18:50.933
HE STOLE BROWNIES OUT OF
THE MOUTH OF HIS BABY.

18:50.967 --> 18:53.067
IT'S A TESTAMENT
TO THE BROWNIE.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.867
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE NOT SEEING.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.133
BECAUSE THEY'RE
INCREDIBLE BROWNIES.

18:57.167 --> 18:58.533
AND IF THEY WERE
MEDIOCRE BROWNIES,

18:58.567 --> 18:59.633
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
HE WOULDN'T
HAVE TAKEN THEM.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.400
WHICH LEADS ME
TO WHY I'M HERE.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.833
I WOULD LOVE

19:03.867 --> 19:05.600
IF YOU COULD
GIVE ME THE RECIPE.

19:05.633 --> 19:06.700
THE BROWNIE RECIPE.

19:06.733 --> 19:07.800
THE BROWNIE RECIPE.

19:07.833 --> 19:09.100
OH, I CAN'T DO THAT, DARLING,
I CAN'T.

19:09.133 --> 19:11.067
NO, NO, NO, WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.567
NO, I CAN'T, BECAUSE
IT'S A SECRET FAMILY RECIPE

19:13.600 --> 19:15.067
THAT MY GRANDMOTHER
HANDED DOWN TO ME, I CAN'T.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.333
SUZIE, SUZIE, SUZIE.

19:16.367 --> 19:17.533
LOOK WHO YOU'RE
TALKING TO HERE.

19:17.567 --> 19:18.800
I'M TALKING
TO LARRY DAVID.

19:18.833 --> 19:22.933
YEAH, THE GUY WHO NEVER EVER
TELLS ANYBODY ANYTHING.

19:22.967 --> 19:24.500
I AM KNOWN FOR THAT.

19:24.533 --> 19:25.933
STRANGERS
COME UP TO ME

19:25.967 --> 19:27.933
TO TELL ME
THEIR DEEPEST SECRETS.

19:27.967 --> 19:30.833
WELL, UM, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW
FOR FUTURE REFERENCE

19:30.867 --> 19:32.800
FOR OTHER THINGS THAT
I MIGHT NEED TO TRUST YOU WITH,

19:32.833 --> 19:33.833
BUT THIS IS A SECRET.

19:33.867 --> 19:34.967
WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN TO YOU ?

19:35.067 --> 19:36.767
OKAY, OKAY,
SECRET, SECRET, SECRET.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.667
I'LL TELL YOU A SECRET,
HOW ABOUT THAT ?

19:38.700 --> 19:40.100
NOBODY KNOWS,
NOT EVEN CHERYL.

19:40.133 --> 19:41.967
WELL, IF YOU'D
LIKE TO TELL ME.

19:42.067 --> 19:43.167
I MIGHT BE LOSING
A TESTICLE.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.400
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.533
YEAH, IT'S NOT DEFINITE,
THE POINT IS, I'M TELLING YOU,

19:46.567 --> 19:48.400
I'M SHARING SOMETHING WITH YOU,
BECAUSE I TRUST YOU.

19:48.433 --> 19:49.967
JUST THE WAY
I KNOW YOU CAN TRUST ME.

19:50.067 --> 19:51.433
LARRY, I CANNOT
GIVE YOU THE RECIPE.

19:51.467 --> 19:52.633
NO, YOU CAN.
NO, I CAN'T.

19:52.667 --> 19:53.767
I CAN'T.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.500
MY GRANDMOTHER, OKAY ?

19:55.533 --> 19:56.867
MAY SHE
REST IN PEACE,

19:56.900 --> 19:59.733
ENTRUSTED THAT
BROWNIE RECIPE TO ME,

19:59.767 --> 20:03.200
AND YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO BREAK A SACRED CONFIDENCE.

20:03.233 --> 20:05.000
IT'S NOT
"THE MANHATTAN PROJECT,"
YOU KNOW ?!

20:05.033 --> 20:07.100
IT'S JUST A LITTLE--
IT'S A RECIPE.

20:07.133 --> 20:08.467
GO GET A MIX
OR SOMETHING !

20:08.500 --> 20:11.200
YOU'RE ASKING TOO MUCH,
YOU ASK WAY TOO MUCH, I CAN'T.

20:11.233 --> 20:12.967
OSCAR, COME.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.567
I JUST TOLD YOU
I'M GONNA LOSE A BALL !

20:20.000 --> 20:21.467
OKAY, SO, UM,

20:23.133 --> 20:26.533
YOU WANT TO PUT SOME BENADRYL
IN SOME BROWNIES.

20:26.567 --> 20:28.200
A LOT OF BENADRYL.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.400
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

20:32.433 --> 20:33.767
WHAT'S THE DOWNSIDE ?

20:33.800 --> 20:35.900
THINK OF IT,
IT'S LIKE A--

20:35.933 --> 20:37.667
IT'S AN ACT OF HUMANITY
ON YOUR PART.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.167
I'M BEGGING YOU.

20:39.200 --> 20:42.733
AREN'T YOU GUYS SUPPOSED
TO BE GOING TO THE EMMY'S
TOMORROW NIGHT ?

20:42.767 --> 20:43.833
WHY ?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.633
WHAT ?
RICHARD.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.100
IS THAT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT, LARRY ?

20:47.133 --> 20:48.900
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO TAKE HER TO THE EMMY'S

20:48.933 --> 20:50.400
BECAUSE OF
THE WAY SHE LOOKS ?

20:50.433 --> 20:51.967
WHY SHOULD
HE TAKE HER ?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
SHE'S HIDEOUS,
I DON'T BLAME HIM.

20:54.033 --> 20:56.200
ARE YOU GUYS
OUT OF YOUR MIND ?!

20:56.233 --> 20:57.400
( Larry )
WHY ?

20:57.433 --> 21:00.267
IT'S NOT ONLY THAT,
I WANT HER TO GET BETTER.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.267
IT'S 90%.

21:02.300 --> 21:03.733
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO LIE TO HER--

21:03.767 --> 21:04.900
IT'S NOT 90-10.

21:04.933 --> 21:06.733
IT'S 85-15.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.100
NO, NO,
75-25.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.167
IT'S NOT
EVEN THAT.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.233
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

21:10.267 --> 21:11.533
YOU'RE EMBARRASSED
TO BE SEEN WITH HER,

21:11.567 --> 21:13.067
AND I DON'T BLAME HIM,
AND SO WHAT ?

21:13.067 --> 21:14.733
SO, SHE TAKES
A LITTLE BENADRYL,

21:14.767 --> 21:16.100
YOU PUT IT IN THE BROWNIE,
BIG DEAL.

21:16.133 --> 21:18.400
WHY DON'T YOU BUY SOME BROWNIES,
PUT IT IN THERE

21:18.433 --> 21:19.567
AND LEAVE ME
OUT OF THIS !

21:19.600 --> 21:20.833
WE WENT OVER THIS.

21:20.867 --> 21:23.133
DON'T YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT TAMPERING ?

21:23.167 --> 21:24.233
HUH ?

21:24.267 --> 21:26.567
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT TAMPERING ?

21:26.600 --> 21:27.833
WELL,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT

21:27.867 --> 21:30.167
BECAUSE THE BROWNIE
WILL FALL APART.

21:30.200 --> 21:33.267
IT'S GOTTA BE IN THE MIX
WHEN YOU MAKE THE BROWNIE.

21:33.300 --> 21:36.433
MAYBE YOU GUYS
SHOULD JUST TAKE CARE
OF THIS YOURSELF, AND...

21:36.467 --> 21:37.700
NO, HOW CAN--
WE DON'T KNOW--

21:37.733 --> 21:38.900
LEAVE ME
OUT OF THIS.

21:38.933 --> 21:40.267
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BAKE,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

21:40.300 --> 21:41.600
THEY HAVE
TO BE BAKED.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.067
THEY HAVE TO BE BAKED.

21:43.067 --> 21:45.167
DON'T YOU THINK
SHE'S GONNA TASTE BENADRYL
IN THE BROWNIES ?

21:45.200 --> 21:47.133
IT'S TOTALLY TASTELESS.

21:47.167 --> 21:48.633
THERE'S NO TASTE
TO THIS STUFF.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.800
THERE'S NO TASTE
TO IT.

21:50.833 --> 21:52.467
I SPOKE
TO THE PHARMACIST.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.867
OH, YOU ASKED HIM
IF YOU PUT THIS IN BROWNIES,

21:54.900 --> 21:56.233
WILL SOMEONE BE ABLE
TO TASTE IT ?

21:56.267 --> 21:58.633
THERE'S NO TASTE
TO IT AT ALL.

21:58.667 --> 22:00.367
THEY'RE ODORLESS
AND TASTELESS.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.633
( Richard )
MY HEART IS BREAKING
FOR HER BIG HEAD.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.067
IT'S GROTESQUE.

22:04.067 --> 22:06.067
IT'S LIKE SHE SHOULD BE IN
A CARNIVAL ON CONEY ISLAND.

22:06.100 --> 22:07.733
I'M TELLING YOU.

22:07.767 --> 22:10.367
THIS IS THE DUMBEST IDEA
I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.867
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
IT'S A GOOD IDEA,

22:12.900 --> 22:15.100
'CAUSE IF IT WORKS,

22:15.133 --> 22:17.567
SHE THINKS
THE PRAYER DID IT.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.133
THAT'S WHAT'S
SO SMART ABOUT IT.

22:19.167 --> 22:20.533
NOW THE IDEA
IS A GENIUS IDEA.

22:20.567 --> 22:22.367
IT'S NOT LIKE, "HOW DID
I GET BETTER ALL OF A SUDDEN ?"

22:22.400 --> 22:23.767
IT WAS
THEIR RELIGION.

22:23.800 --> 22:24.800
YEAH, IT WAS
THE RELIGION.

22:24.833 --> 22:26.300
YEAH.
PRAYER WORKED.

22:26.333 --> 22:28.967
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ?
IT HAPPENED IN OUR HOUSE.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.067
OKAY.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.667
( Richard )
OKAY.

22:34.700 --> 22:36.200
ALRIGHT, I THINK WE SHOULD--
YOU KNOW.

22:36.233 --> 22:37.967
ALRIGHT, I JUST WANT TO
TALK TO HER FOR A SECOND.

22:38.067 --> 22:39.200
CHERYL.

22:41.533 --> 22:43.833
ALRIGHT, WELL,
THANKS FOR DOING THIS.

22:43.867 --> 22:45.367
I GUESS THIS IS
STUPID, IS IT ?

22:45.400 --> 22:47.300
DO YOU NOT THINK
THIS IS STUPID ?

22:47.333 --> 22:48.800
IT'S NOT
SUCH A BIG DEAL.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.833
LET'S NOT MAKE SUCH
A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT, OKAY ?

22:50.867 --> 22:51.867
IT'S NOT REALLY
A BIG DEAL.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.333
IT'S JUST ANOTHER DAY
IN PARADISE FOR ME.

22:53.367 --> 22:54.400
ALRIGHT, WELL THEN DON'T DO IT,
IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU FEEL.

22:54.433 --> 22:56.433
NO, NO, I'LL DO IT,
I'LL DO IT, JUST GO.

22:56.467 --> 22:57.500
CAN YOU BAKE
THIS STUFF ?

22:57.533 --> 22:58.767
I DON'T EVEN KNOW,
CAN YOU BAKE ?

22:58.800 --> 23:02.467
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
BAKE ANYTHING, I'M SORRY.

23:02.500 --> 23:03.633
PLEASE.

23:09.867 --> 23:11.067
( knocking )

23:14.100 --> 23:16.900
GOT SOME BROWNIES
FOR DEBRA.

23:16.933 --> 23:18.267
MY WIFE
BAKED THEM.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.233
I'LL TAKE THEM
TO HER.

23:20.267 --> 23:22.433
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

23:22.467 --> 23:23.600

23:23.633 --> 23:25.767
WE'D LIKE TO,
BRING HER--

23:25.800 --> 23:27.533
IF IT'S ALL
THE SAME TO YOU.

23:27.567 --> 23:29.933
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE
THE LOOK ON HER FACE

23:29.967 --> 23:31.433
WHEN I GIVE THESE TO HER,
IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO ME.

23:31.467 --> 23:32.867
ME, TOO.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.567
JUST FOR
ONE MINUTE.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.100

23:55.100 --> 23:56.200
SURPRISE.

23:56.233 --> 23:57.667

24:26.667 --> 24:29.800
YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE NOT QUITE THE SAME.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.700
NO, THEY'RE

24:31.733 --> 24:32.933
YEAH, YEAH.

24:35.533 --> 24:38.067
TELL CHERYL I SAID THANK YOU
FOR MAKING THE EFFORT,

24:38.067 --> 24:39.867
BUT THOSE ARE

24:39.900 --> 24:42.933
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?
THEY'RE DELICIOUS, EAT IT.

24:42.967 --> 24:43.967
IT'S GOOD.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.900
IT'S GOOD,

24:45.933 --> 24:47.867

24:47.900 --> 24:49.700
NOT THE SAME BROWNIES ?
IT'S THE SAME BROWNIE !

24:49.733 --> 24:51.167
THEY'RE DEFINITELY
NOT THE SAME BROWNIES.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.567
BELIEVE ME,
THEY'RE THE SAME BROWNIE,

24:52.600 --> 24:54.600
MY WIFE BAKED THEM,
I KNOW WHAT SHE BAKED.

24:54.633 --> 24:56.467
THESE REALLY SUCK.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.167
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

24:58.200 --> 24:59.533
BETWEEN SUGAR
AND SALT.

24:59.567 --> 25:01.333
HOW DARE YOU INSULT
MY WIFE'S BAKING !

25:01.367 --> 25:02.867
THERE'S A LITTLE
SOMETHING.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.067

25:04.067 --> 25:05.100
ALRIGHT.

25:05.133 --> 25:07.633
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
FINE.

25:07.667 --> 25:10.400
TAKE THEM FOR LATER,

25:10.433 --> 25:12.267
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME

25:12.300 --> 25:14.267
THEY'RE HORRIBLE !

25:14.300 --> 25:17.900
WHAT TIME ARE YOU

25:20.933 --> 25:23.067

THIS IS SO NOT--

25:42.867 --> 25:44.167

25:44.200 --> 25:46.833

25:49.900 --> 25:52.467

26:02.233 --> 26:04.800

THIS IS JUST

26:04.833 --> 26:08.133
YOU CAN'T WAIT THREE HOURS ?
IT'LL COME ON REGULAR TV.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.500
WE WANT TO WATCH IT
WHEN THE NEW YORKERS WATCH IT.

26:10.533 --> 26:12.167
WE NEED TO SEE

AT THE COFFEE SHOP ?

26:21.200 --> 26:22.233
WHAT BUSINESS ?

26:22.267 --> 26:25.067
THE BUSINESS
WITH THE BLACK GUY.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.833
YOU FIXED HIS TIP ?

26:26.867 --> 26:27.900
( Cheryl )
WHAT HAPPENED ?

26:27.933 --> 26:28.933
SO ?
YEAH.

26:28.967 --> 26:30.200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"SO" ?

26:30.233 --> 26:33.267
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ?
LARRY'S A TIP PROFILER.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.933
FIXED
A BLACK MAN'S TIP.

26:34.967 --> 26:36.433
WELL, HE DIDN'T
LEAVE ENOUGH OF A TIP,

26:36.467 --> 26:38.067
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO ?

26:38.067 --> 26:42.267
WELL, YOU TRYING TO GET
A NAACP IMAGE AWARD
OR SOMETHING ?

26:42.300 --> 26:43.467
IF IT WASN'T
A RACIAL THING,

26:43.500 --> 26:45.300
WHY'D YOU DO IT
BEHIND HIS BACK ?

26:45.333 --> 26:47.733
I DIDN'T DO IT
BEHIND HIS BACK !

26:47.767 --> 26:49.433
HE TIP-TOED BACK
INTO THE RESTAURANT.

26:49.467 --> 26:50.533
I DID NOT !

26:50.567 --> 26:51.833
YOU SHOULD'VE
SEEN IT.

26:51.867 --> 26:54.367
I DIDN'T TIP-TOE,
HE STORMED OUT IN A HUFF !

26:54.400 --> 26:56.167
I WOULD'VE DONE IT
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE,

26:56.200 --> 26:57.300
BUT HE STORMED OUT.

26:57.333 --> 26:59.067
WELL, WHY'D
HE STORM OUT ?

26:59.067 --> 27:00.867
WELL, BECAUSE I FIRED HIM,
THAT'S WHY.

27:00.900 --> 27:02.667
YOU FIRED HIM ?

27:02.700 --> 27:04.167
YOU FIRED HIM ?!

27:04.200 --> 27:06.333
WELL, WHY YOU
FIRE THE BLACK MAN ?

27:06.367 --> 27:09.133
I FIRED THE BLACK MAN,

27:09.167 --> 27:12.733
BECAUSE HE'S THE GUY WHO SET UP
THE WHOLE SYSTEM HERE

27:12.767 --> 27:14.100
AND IT DOESN'T WORK.

27:14.133 --> 27:17.233
AND HE'S HERE LIKE, EVERY WEEK,
I'M GIVING HIM CHECKS.

27:17.267 --> 27:20.467
WE'VE GOT FIVE REMOTES,
I CAN'T TURN IT ON.

27:20.500 --> 27:22.300
BUT I KNOW, YOU KNOW,
BLACK MAN,

27:22.333 --> 27:24.133
HE CAN NEVER
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

27:24.167 --> 27:26.333
AND HE SHOULDN'T
GET FIRED FROM A JOB.

27:26.367 --> 27:28.733
BLACK PEOPLE ALWAYS
DO EVERYTHING RIGHT.

27:28.767 --> 27:31.300
YOU GOTTA TURN
THE DAMN SATELLITE ON

27:31.333 --> 27:32.533
FOR THE TV

GREEN LIGHT ?

27:34.700 --> 27:36.467
JUST GOTTA
TURN IT ON.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.500

on a hemorrhoid.

28:18.833 --> 28:21.233
When E.T. called home,

28:23.267 --> 28:25.533
