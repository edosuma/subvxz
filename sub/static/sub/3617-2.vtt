PIPER: "A year after the death
of Snow White's mother,

00:04.083 --> 00:05.484
the king remarried.

00:05.584 --> 00:08.818
But his new bride was in fact
a wicked witch,

00:08.918 --> 00:11.899
- one consumed by jealousy--"
- What are you still doing up?

00:11.999 --> 00:14.484
Not sleeping, as usual.

00:14.584 --> 00:17.192
First trimester nonsense,
I guess.

00:17.292 --> 00:20.983
- You want me to
mix you up a potion?
- Oh, no, thanks.

00:21.083 --> 00:22.983
I don't want to turn my baby
into a guinea pig.

00:23.083 --> 00:24.692
I got enough to worry about.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.442
Like I'd risk turning my future
niece into a rodent. Please.

00:27.542 --> 00:29.818
No, I was speaking figuratively.

00:29.918 --> 00:31.818
And it is not a knock at
your super-witch kick.

00:31.918 --> 00:33.859
It's just, I don't
wanna subject her

00:33.959 --> 00:36.818
to anything that could
be remotely bad for her,
that's all.

00:36.918 --> 00:39.401
Then maybe you should put away
those silly fairy tales.

00:39.501 --> 00:41.899
Silly? You think
fairy tales are silly?

00:41.999 --> 00:43.734
Yeah, they're all about
helpless women

00:43.834 --> 00:45.899
needing big, strong men
to come and rescue them.

00:45.999 --> 00:48.900
Plus they're filled with
evil witches. You really
wanna teach your kid that?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.275
No, I wanna teach her values.

00:51.375 --> 00:53.234
And that's what fairy tales
are best at.

00:53.334 --> 00:55.067
You know, good overcomes evil.

00:55.167 --> 00:56.651
That's how Grams taught us.

00:56.751 --> 00:58.692
Well, my grandmother taught
me values just fine

00:58.792 --> 01:01.692
without big, bad wolves
devouring little girls.

01:01.792 --> 01:04.983
- You want my advice?
- Not really.

01:05.083 --> 01:10.484
You should ditch the fiction and
do what all other moms-to-be do,

01:10.584 --> 01:12.899
and that is to rely
on your natural instincts.

01:12.999 --> 01:16.609
Well, my natural instincts
are to panic.

01:16.709 --> 01:19.275
And besides, every other
mother-to-be does not
have to worry

01:19.375 --> 01:22.567
about her child orbing out
to Tahiti when they are
sent to their room.

01:22.667 --> 01:23.818
I don't have a clue.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.317
Luckily, you have
two magical sisters

01:25.417 --> 01:26.899
who are gonna help you
any way they can.

01:26.999 --> 01:30.042
So don't worry, honey,
you're gonna be just fine.

01:31.999 --> 01:34.000
I hope so.

01:36.667 --> 01:38.025
Where were we?

01:38.125 --> 01:40.484
"A year after the death
of Snow White's mother,

01:40.584 --> 01:42.192
the king remarried.

01:42.292 --> 01:45.401
But his new bride was
in fact a wicked witch,

01:45.501 --> 01:47.567
one consumed by jealousy.

01:47.667 --> 01:51.109
Every day she asked the magic
mirror the same question."

01:51.209 --> 01:52.859
Aren't you dead yet?

01:52.959 --> 01:58.025
[CHUCKLES] Still so bitter
after all these centuries?

01:58.125 --> 01:59.999
Some things never change.

02:01.999 --> 02:04.275
KEEPER:
Careful, my boy.

02:04.375 --> 02:08.859
Those are not just symbols.
They are pieces of history.

02:08.959 --> 02:10.192
I understand.

02:10.292 --> 02:13.899
Never forget,
the power of every fairy tale

02:13.999 --> 02:17.275
emanates from each of these.

02:17.375 --> 02:22.025
Their magic continues to
shape every child born,

02:22.125 --> 02:23.899
even to this day.

02:23.999 --> 02:29.417
Which makes the task of
preserving and protecting
them that much greater.

02:32.709 --> 02:34.999
No, the mirror.
Don't let it fall!

02:38.584 --> 02:40.375
[PANTING]

02:44.167 --> 02:45.942
Thanks so much.

02:46.042 --> 02:48.484
I thought I'd never
get out of there.

02:48.584 --> 02:49.667
[CHOKES]

02:51.501 --> 02:53.876
Now, this is the way
to begin a story.

02:56.375 --> 02:57.899
Who are you?

02:57.999 --> 03:01.317
A little rusty on your
fairy tales, I see.

03:01.417 --> 03:03.899
Evil witch, magic mirror?

03:03.999 --> 03:06.484
Speaks only the truth?

03:06.584 --> 03:08.899
Perhaps this will help:

03:08.999 --> 03:11.651
Freedom's loss
must be unwitting

03:11.751 --> 03:14.959
Into the glass
to do my bidding

03:24.999 --> 03:27.734
Now, amuse me.

03:27.834 --> 03:30.651
Not that you have any choice.

03:30.751 --> 03:32.442
Mirror, mirror on the wall,

03:32.542 --> 03:36.999
who is the most
powerful witch of all?

03:38.292 --> 03:41.692
You're much stronger
than most witches I see.

03:41.792 --> 03:44.150
Yet, truth be told,

03:44.250 --> 03:48.417
there are three
more powerful than thee.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.459
We'll see about that.

04:55.999 --> 04:56.983
Piper?

04:57.083 --> 04:59.899
[GASPS]
Where's the baby?

04:59.999 --> 05:02.899
It's okay. You're okay.

05:02.999 --> 05:04.734
I think I had a nightmare.

05:04.834 --> 05:06.401
Yeah, the Brothers Grimm
strike again.

05:06.501 --> 05:08.899
I wonder how they got
their name. Where's Leo?

05:08.999 --> 05:12.526
I don't know. I think he's
helping one of his charges.

05:12.626 --> 05:15.317
- What are you doing?
- Failing miserably.

05:15.417 --> 05:18.776
I can't seem to make this
protection potion work.

05:18.876 --> 05:20.942
Well, that's because
it can't be done.

05:21.042 --> 05:22.651
Well, according to
the Book, it can.

05:22.751 --> 05:24.192
Your Grams was working
on an entry,

05:24.292 --> 05:26.776
so that means she was close
to figuring one out.

05:26.876 --> 05:29.734
Well, too bad she's not around.
She could help us both out.

05:29.834 --> 05:31.899
I just-- I need
a little guidance.

05:31.999 --> 05:35.899
What about your friend, Wendy?
She just had a baby, ask her.

05:35.999 --> 05:39.526
Yeah, not one that could
heal herself from the womb.

05:39.626 --> 05:42.900
I just wish I could talk
to somebody who's been
through this before.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.651
There you are.

05:44.751 --> 05:46.899
Paige, did you ever make
that vanquishing potion?

05:46.999 --> 05:49.317
- Vanquishing potion?
- The one for Cole.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.899
Remember, I gave you the letter
opener with his blood on it?

05:51.999 --> 05:53.150
Right, vanquishing potion.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.776
I'm sorry, I didn't know you
needed that right away. Do you?

05:55.876 --> 05:58.900
Well, if the nightmare
I had last night turns
out to be a premonition,

05:59.000 --> 06:00.442
then yeah, big-time.

06:00.542 --> 06:02.567
He had me back in the
underworld as his queen.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.818
Oh, yeah, but you've had
that nightmare before.

06:04.918 --> 06:08.234
I've lived that nightmare
before. We all have.

06:08.334 --> 06:10.899
- But this time we
have to be prepared.
- No arguments here.

06:10.999 --> 06:12.401
And he's got a lot
more powers now.

06:12.501 --> 06:14.692
So there's no telling how
he's going to come after me.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.484
You guys have to be
really careful, okay?

06:16.584 --> 06:18.899
What, you think Cole's
gonna try and kill us?

06:18.999 --> 06:21.442
That would not be exactly
the best way to win you back.

06:21.542 --> 06:23.526
Yeah, but it wouldn't be
the first time he tried.

06:23.626 --> 06:25.025
But he just helped
us save her.

06:25.125 --> 06:27.442
Only because he
didn't wanna lose me.

06:27.542 --> 06:31.776
All I'm saying is we've
gotta be ready just
in case he tries something.

06:31.876 --> 06:34.442
He is still a demon.

06:34.542 --> 06:36.999
Call me at work if you
get the potion, okay?

06:43.999 --> 06:47.317
- Wanna see more?
- No.

06:47.417 --> 06:50.526
I think I've seen enough
to know how to kill them.

06:50.626 --> 06:53.067
Powerful though you are,
I doubt it can be done,

06:53.167 --> 06:55.025
for good magic protects
the Charmed Ones.

06:55.125 --> 06:58.067
Still, I wonder if it can
protect them against

06:58.167 --> 07:00.899
such powerful magic
as we have here.

07:00.999 --> 07:02.442
Certainly worth a try.

07:02.542 --> 07:04.899
But using the props
for evil could--

07:04.999 --> 07:06.899
Change the meaning
of fairy tales?

07:06.999 --> 07:11.109
Shift them away
from good? So be it.

07:11.209 --> 07:16.651
Let's begin with Snow White.
She was easy prey.

07:16.751 --> 07:18.667
Woodsman, come forth.

07:28.999 --> 07:32.250
Bring me the heart of the
witch who's as white as snow.

07:34.876 --> 07:36.125
As you wish.

07:37.626 --> 07:39.734
Now, mirror, mirror.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.999
Show me the sister
who's been burned by love.

07:45.375 --> 07:48.818
Oh, I know, I know.
I am very, very late.

07:48.918 --> 07:50.899
It's okay, I switched
your 9:00 with the 2:00,

07:50.999 --> 07:53.192
bumped your 10 to 12,
and I made your 11:00 a lunch.

07:53.292 --> 07:56.818
I have no idea what you just
said, but it sounds great.
Any messages?

07:56.918 --> 08:00.192
Yeah, your divorce attorney
called, then Cole, Cole
and Cole again.

08:00.292 --> 08:01.899
Get my divorce attorney
on the phone.

08:01.999 --> 08:05.359
- Okay.
- Oh! Oh.

08:05.459 --> 08:07.109
- I'm sorry.
- I'll get some paper towels.

08:07.209 --> 08:08.899
- I am so sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.

08:08.999 --> 08:10.900
Here, I--

08:11.000 --> 08:12.899
Thanks.

08:12.999 --> 08:14.776
I really am terribly sorry.

08:14.876 --> 08:16.776
I'd be happy to pay
for the dry-cleaning.

08:16.876 --> 08:19.042
No, that's not necessary.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.734
- Mr...?
- Prince. Adam Prince.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.567
- Hi, Adam, I'm--
- Phoebe.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.292
I read your column.

08:28.626 --> 08:31.609
- You do?
- You seem surprised.

08:31.709 --> 08:34.899
Well, yeah, you're not exactly
my target audience.

08:34.999 --> 08:37.234
Unless you're a closet
housewife pining for love.

08:37.333 --> 08:40.899
Well, one out of
two is not bad.

08:40.999 --> 08:43.734
Adam, sorry.
Got hung up in traffic.

08:43.833 --> 08:46.317
Wh--? What are
you doing here?

08:46.417 --> 08:48.567
You two know each other?

08:48.667 --> 08:50.192
Well, yeah,
we're married.

08:50.292 --> 08:52.942
Yeah, but about
to be divorced.

08:53.042 --> 08:55.899
I didn't want this to
affect your decision
whether to buy the paper.

08:55.999 --> 08:58.526
What--? Buy what pa--?
This paper?

08:58.626 --> 09:01.401
Adam's family owns
several papers across
the country, Phoebe.

09:01.501 --> 09:02.899
TV stations too.

09:02.999 --> 09:05.401
And Cole, through his law firm,
was the one that suggested

09:05.501 --> 09:07.317
I might be interested
in buying this one.

09:07.417 --> 09:10.192
That's fascinating
stuff right there.

09:10.292 --> 09:12.542
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

09:16.834 --> 09:18.526
I don't know what
you're up to,

09:18.626 --> 09:21.109
but whatever it is,
it is not gonna work.

09:21.209 --> 09:22.899
Don't you think
you're being paranoid?

09:22.999 --> 09:26.859
With my demon ex-husband
from hell? No, Cole, I don't.

09:26.959 --> 09:29.067
Look, I'm just trying
to help you, okay?

09:29.167 --> 09:30.859
I found out that Adam
liked your column,

09:30.959 --> 09:32.983
so I figured if he
could syndicate it--

09:33.083 --> 09:36.025
If you hurt me or my sisters,
I will vanquish you.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.375
And this time,
I'll make sure it sticks.

09:50.209 --> 09:51.651
You all right?

09:51.751 --> 09:55.401
Yeah. I'll be fine.

09:55.501 --> 09:58.899
So I guess this is probably not
the best time to ask you out.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.692
I mean, not on
a date, per se.

10:00.792 --> 10:03.776
It's just that I'm
hosting a charity fundraiser
tonight at the St. Regis,

10:03.876 --> 10:06.899
and I thought maybe
if you're interested...

10:06.999 --> 10:09.609
I'm interested.

10:09.709 --> 10:12.567
And very, very flattered.

10:12.667 --> 10:15.584
But you're probably right,
it's not the best time for me,
you know.

10:16.584 --> 10:18.959
- Sure.
- Rain check?

10:19.751 --> 10:20.899
Absolutely.

10:20.999 --> 10:22.234
Okay.

10:22.334 --> 10:23.876
All right.

10:27.375 --> 10:30.442
You heard me, Leo. I want you
to bring Grams back, now.

10:30.542 --> 10:31.983
Okay, I can't do that.
She's dead.

10:32.083 --> 10:34.359
Well, I realize that.
Thank you very much, Leo.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.067
I'm not asking you
to resurrect her,

10:36.167 --> 10:39.234
I just need her here for a
little while, for some advice.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.401
Then why don't you
try conjuring her?

10:41.501 --> 10:42.776
You did it
once before.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.567
Yeah, okay, but that was
a unique situation, okay?

10:45.667 --> 10:47.899
And besides, I already tried.
It didn't work.

10:47.999 --> 10:51.275
Look, I know this doesn't seem
important, but it is to me.

10:51.375 --> 10:52.899
I can't do this alone.

10:52.999 --> 10:55.067
Well, you're not alone.
I'm here.

10:55.167 --> 10:57.526
Yeah, I know, and it's not your
fault.

10:57.626 --> 10:59.317
But there's only so much
you can do, okay?

10:59.417 --> 11:02.983
I'm the one that's carrying
the baby, and I don't want
to screw it up.

11:03.083 --> 11:05.776
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not ridiculous.

11:05.876 --> 11:08.401
It is not ridiculous at all.
This is not raging hormones
talking.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.899
Okay, this is a very special
baby with very special needs,

11:10.999 --> 11:13.692
and I need someone pretty
damn special to help me
figure it out.

11:13.792 --> 11:15.209
And when I say now,
I mean now!

11:21.834 --> 11:22.999
Piper.

11:23.999 --> 11:25.818
Thank you.

11:25.918 --> 11:27.192
Don't thank me,
I didn't do anything.

11:27.292 --> 11:30.442
What am I doing here?

11:30.542 --> 11:31.983
And corporeal to boot?

11:32.083 --> 11:34.900
Well, what do you mean? Didn't
you come on your own power?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.818
Honey, I'm good,
but I'm not that good.

11:37.918 --> 11:41.999
Well, as long as I'm here,
don't I get a hug?

11:43.999 --> 11:47.083
But wait, I still don't
understand. Who summoned you?

11:48.375 --> 11:51.734
- The baby?
- No. You think?

11:51.834 --> 11:53.692
Maybe you tapped
into her power somehow

11:53.792 --> 11:54.900
and made your
wish come true.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.692
Oh, you wished for me? Why?

11:58.792 --> 12:01.109

39:40.292 --> 39:43.818
Because I don't
belong here anymore.

39:43.918 --> 39:45.899
See, you thought
you needed me,

39:45.999 --> 39:48.899
but I was only here to
remind you that you don't.

39:48.999 --> 39:49.942
Not even for her.

39:50.042 --> 39:51.942
Okay, but what about me?

39:52.042 --> 39:54.359
I feel like I didn't get to
spend any time with you.

39:54.459 --> 39:58.359
That's okay. I don't
stay dead long.

39:58.459 --> 39:59.834
Good point.

40:01.876 --> 40:05.042
Well, do I at least
get a hug goodbye?

40:08.999 --> 40:11.651
It was great to
finally meet you.

40:11.751 --> 40:13.250
Grams.

40:23.292 --> 40:25.667
Be safe, my darlings.

40:34.167 --> 40:36.275
Where are you going?

40:36.375 --> 40:38.999
I need to catch up
on my fairy tales.

40:43.999 --> 40:47.999
I guess I'm gonna catch up
on some sleep.

40:54.999 --> 40:57.459
Okay, you want me
to say it, don't you?

40:59.209 --> 41:02.626
I was wrong, okay?
I'm sorry.

41:03.999 --> 41:05.900
I really am.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.776
It's not your fault. I lost
your trust a long time ago.

41:08.876 --> 41:10.734
I can't expect to earn
it back overnight.

41:10.834 --> 41:14.609
I don't think I'm gonna
trust anyone any time soon.

41:14.709 --> 41:17.083
Do you mean Adam?

41:18.999 --> 41:22.359
He was just being used by
the witch. He's a good guy.

41:22.459 --> 41:26.292
Really? I don't think
I can even tell anymore.

41:46.209 --> 41:48.000
What are we doing here?

41:48.999 --> 41:51.899
Rebuilding your trust.

41:51.999 --> 41:54.526
You liked him when you
first met him, right?

41:54.626 --> 41:56.899
Yeah, so?

41:56.999 --> 41:58.859
So he's not under a spell.

41:58.959 --> 42:03.734
Why don't you see if your
original instincts were right?

42:03.834 --> 42:07.692
Look, I don't want you to fall
in love with him, Phoebe.

42:07.792 --> 42:10.250
But you need to
realize he's not evil.

42:11.584 --> 42:13.651
Why are you doing this?

42:13.751 --> 42:17.899
Because unless you learn
to trust yourself again,

42:17.999 --> 42:19.751
you'll never learn
to trust me.
