00:16.621 --> 00:18.922
Go back!

00:21.126 --> 00:24.162
Go back where?

00:24.163 --> 00:26.464
Where are we?

00:26.465 --> 00:29.733
- Why am I wet?
- What's with the hourglass?

00:30.835 --> 00:35.840
I don't know, but it looks familiar.

00:35.841 --> 00:37.042
Where's Cassandra?

00:37.043 --> 00:39.511
Phone is fried.

00:39.512 --> 00:42.347
So's mine. Soaked.

00:42.348 --> 00:45.617
Does anybody remember how we got here?

00:45.618 --> 00:50.121
Pizza! There was pizza.
I remember the anchovies.

00:50.122 --> 00:51.690
You don't like anchovies.

00:51.691 --> 00:54.158
Which is why I remember them.

00:55.760 --> 00:58.463
Stone, recognize any of this?

00:58.464 --> 01:02.934
Looks like smoky quartz,

01:02.935 --> 01:05.869
but different. I've never
seen anything like this.

01:05.870 --> 01:08.938
Okay, so let's recap.

01:08.939 --> 01:12.809
We don't know where we
are or why we're wet.

01:12.810 --> 01:16.146
We can't remember anything
that happened before this.

01:16.147 --> 01:19.115
- Apart from pizza.
- And garlic bread.

01:19.116 --> 01:21.084
Some amazing garlic bread.

01:21.085 --> 01:24.187
Mystery solved. We were
ambushed by an Olive Garden.

01:24.188 --> 01:28.223
Come on, guys, think. What are
we missing about this place?

01:30.360 --> 01:32.961
Well, it's got a cleanin' lady.

01:35.665 --> 01:37.966
Hola.

01:45.952 --> 01:54.590
Subtitle sync and corrections by

01:59.689 --> 02:02.692
That sound.

02:02.693 --> 02:05.661
I... I remember.

02:07.897 --> 02:10.166
There was pizza.

02:10.167 --> 02:13.937
Where do you hide a
massive actual pyramid?

02:13.938 --> 02:17.407
Inside another massive actual pyramid!

02:17.408 --> 02:20.210
The Luxor Casino in Vegas. It's genius!

02:20.211 --> 02:23.379
I mean, who'd ever think to
look for a real Egyptian pyramid

02:23.380 --> 02:25.281
under a fake American one?

02:25.282 --> 02:27.650
- These guys.
- Ugh, anchovies.

02:27.651 --> 02:30.820
First round's on me. Silver
bullets. Pew-pew! Pew!

02:30.821 --> 02:33.289
Only three beers? You're
not gonna turn it loose?

02:33.290 --> 02:36.526
No, you're gonna turn
it loose. I'm exhausted.

02:36.527 --> 02:39.462
Completely and utterly, uh...

02:39.463 --> 02:41.097
- What's the word, Jones?
- Knackered.

02:41.098 --> 02:43.433
I need a bath and a bed. Good night.

02:43.434 --> 02:45.668
Oh, hey, oh, no! You can't go, because

02:45.669 --> 02:47.170
we're having fun! Funny-fun-fun!

02:47.171 --> 02:48.705
- Fun with Baird.
- Non-stop fun.

02:48.706 --> 02:50.540
- Non-stop fun.
- A couple beers.

02:50.541 --> 02:52.175
- What?
- What's anything?

02:52.176 --> 02:54.244
- I...
- What?

02:54.245 --> 02:56.012
We're just really worried about you.

02:56.013 --> 03:00.216
Well, we thought you might... be lonely.

03:00.217 --> 03:02.519
You know, with Flynn doing his whole

03:02.520 --> 03:04.654
"Flynn be gone" routine, and...

03:04.655 --> 03:07.390
Guys, that's just...

03:07.391 --> 03:09.626
it's... it's really sweet, actually.

03:09.627 --> 03:12.529
But I'm fine, really fine. Really.

03:12.530 --> 03:15.431
We just want you to know
that we're here for you.

03:15.432 --> 03:17.634
Because the Guardian
protects the Librarians,

03:17.635 --> 03:20.569
- but who protects the Guardian?
- Ooh.

03:21.805 --> 03:23.706
It's kind of a buzzkill
when I put it like that.

03:23.707 --> 03:27.476
Ah. Oh, okay. Okay, I get it.

03:28.945 --> 03:31.381
Is that why you left me
that present this morning,

03:31.382 --> 03:32.749
as a little pick-me-up?

03:32.750 --> 03:34.250
- What?
- What present?

03:34.251 --> 03:37.220
This compact mirror. It's beautiful.

03:37.221 --> 03:39.689
It's engraved, and it
has this nice stone,

03:39.690 --> 03:41.024
and it's silver...

03:41.025 --> 03:44.060
Who would want something
as useless as that?

03:44.061 --> 03:45.995
Oh, thank God. I was trying to work out

03:45.996 --> 03:47.059
how to pretend I liked it.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.298
Maybe Flynn left it for you.

03:48.299 --> 03:51.434
Leave it to Flynn to give me
something completely useless.

03:51.435 --> 03:53.937
Now a crossbow, that
would've come in handy

03:53.938 --> 03:56.105
in the secret underground pyramid.

03:56.106 --> 03:59.776
You know what I love about
secret underground pyramids?

03:59.777 --> 04:01.277
The souvenirs.

04:01.278 --> 04:04.314
Jones, you can't just take
coins from a historical site.

04:04.315 --> 04:06.516
- You gotta give 'em...
- Don't you dare use the M word!

04:06.517 --> 04:07.951
...to a museum!

04:11.154 --> 04:13.288
You think it's a blackout?

04:14.757 --> 04:18.125
Why did everyone stop moving?

04:50.094 --> 04:53.962
Eve Baird. Tonight...

05:05.642 --> 05:07.476
Did you all just see that?

05:15.385 --> 05:16.986
That's him, that's the one.

05:16.987 --> 05:18.888
He is an ancient,

05:18.889 --> 05:22.258
vengeful quasi-deity and
he is called the "Reaper."

05:22.259 --> 05:24.360
You can't see his face
in any of these pictures.

05:24.361 --> 05:26.996
No, no one ever sees the Reaper's face.

05:26.997 --> 05:28.765
It is as impossible to see his face

05:28.766 --> 05:31.000
as it is to escape his clutches.

05:31.001 --> 05:32.268
So what are those?

05:32.269 --> 05:34.936
Hourglass.

05:36.105 --> 05:38.708
Prophecy cube.

05:38.709 --> 05:41.144
Prophecy cube baffles me.

05:41.145 --> 05:43.980
The hourglass is simple enough.

05:43.981 --> 05:45.982
The Reaper is a supernatural assassin,

05:45.983 --> 05:50.386
summoned by magic users
to kill other magic users,

05:50.387 --> 05:52.755
or it seems, in this case, a Guardian.

05:52.756 --> 05:54.791
You mean I'm the hit?

05:54.792 --> 05:57.160
Wait, no offense, but why her?

05:57.161 --> 06:00.296
I... I... the hourglass.

06:00.297 --> 06:02.432
You have until the sands run out tonight

06:02.433 --> 06:05.335
and then the Reaper will return for you.

06:05.336 --> 06:07.236
- Listen, Skippy.
- "Skippy"?

06:07.237 --> 06:11.040
There's an easy way
to stop an hourglass.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.875
There is no way to stop the Reaper, Eve.

06:32.389 --> 06:34.957
Search for a door! If we
got in, we can get out!

06:34.958 --> 06:37.893
- I'm on it.
- Dios, ayudame! What is that thing?

06:37.894 --> 06:39.228
I'm sorry, what's your name?

06:39.229 --> 06:40.429
Nina. Nina Mitrani.

06:40.430 --> 06:41.533
Nina, don't worry about it.

06:41.534 --> 06:42.932
Just focus on finding a door.

06:42.933 --> 06:45.401
But if we can't get out, can it get in?

06:45.402 --> 06:47.169
Shouldn't we stay here?

06:47.170 --> 06:49.638
The lady makes a good point.

06:49.639 --> 06:52.174
Baird...?

06:52.175 --> 06:54.443
Whatever you are, show yourself.

06:54.444 --> 06:56.312
I surrender!

06:56.313 --> 06:58.247
- To who?
- To you.

06:58.248 --> 07:00.016
You don't need to surrender to me.

07:00.017 --> 07:02.151
Okay... I don't then?

07:02.152 --> 07:04.887
- What's your name, bubba?
- Tyson Lopez.

07:04.888 --> 07:07.857
You always walk around with two
pairs of swim goggles, Tyson?

07:07.858 --> 07:10.059
I don't know. Are these mine?

07:10.060 --> 07:12.862
Uh, swim... A swimming pool!

07:12.863 --> 07:14.597
Yes, we were at a school.

07:14.598 --> 07:16.621
That's a letter jacket.
What is that... "MH," "MH"?

07:16.622 --> 07:19.935
- Mayfield High.
- Mayfield High?

07:19.936 --> 07:21.804
That's my school.

07:21.805 --> 07:24.774
- Principal Fairbrother?
- Tyson?

07:24.775 --> 07:27.076
Nina? How did you...

07:27.077 --> 07:28.878
You're all from the same school?

07:28.879 --> 07:30.012
And you are?

07:30.013 --> 07:31.580
The Librarians.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.549
I don't think so.

07:33.550 --> 07:35.383
None of you is Mrs. Jennings.

07:36.819 --> 07:38.587
Listen, are you on the swim team?

07:38.588 --> 07:40.322
Yeah, I'm captain.

07:40.323 --> 07:42.024
Aha! Hence the goggles.

07:42.025 --> 07:43.325
What do you mean, "hence"?

07:43.326 --> 07:44.960
Hence that he put on
two pair of goggles,

07:44.961 --> 07:48.264
and we, fully clothed,
jumped into an amnesia pool?

07:48.265 --> 07:51.567
Can we recap? We don't know
where we are or how we got here.

07:51.568 --> 07:53.235
It's okay, I already did the recap.

07:53.236 --> 07:55.271
Oh, excuse me. Are you in charge here?

07:55.272 --> 07:57.540
Well, yes. Actually, I am.

07:57.541 --> 07:59.875
Oh. Really?

07:59.876 --> 08:01.677
So the three of you are
from the same school.

08:01.678 --> 08:04.914
It must mean something.
Captain of the swim team,

08:04.915 --> 08:07.048
Mayfield High...

08:10.786 --> 08:12.487
I've seen you before!

08:13.722 --> 08:15.791
From the clippings book.

08:15.792 --> 08:18.227
I don't get it, Jenkins.
Who'd want me dead?

08:18.228 --> 08:20.296
Come on, Baird, don't be so modest.

08:20.297 --> 08:22.465
- Who doesn't want you dead?
- How about the agents of DOSA?

08:22.466 --> 08:24.133
How about a crazy
Egyptian god named Apep?

08:24.134 --> 08:25.668
Whoever it is is very powerful.

08:25.669 --> 08:28.804
It takes a very big dose of
magic to summon the Reaper.

08:28.805 --> 08:32.607
- Well, can we reverse the summoning?
- No.

08:32.609 --> 08:34.243
The Reaper cannot be unsummoned.

08:34.244 --> 08:36.111
He will only leave
this plane of existence

08:36.113 --> 08:39.414
once he has his kill.

08:39.416 --> 08:42.384
- Who guards the Guardian?
- What is a prophecy cube

08:42.385 --> 08:43.727
and why does the Reaper have one?

08:43.729 --> 08:45.654
A prophecy cube has
a vision of the future

08:45.655 --> 08:48.257
that is, to use a modern
parlance, downloaded

08:48.258 --> 08:50.759
into a cube of prophecy glass.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.495
Looking at the patterns on this one,

08:52.496 --> 08:54.964
I would say it was forged
by the Oracle of Delphi.

08:54.965 --> 08:57.967
- You mean, like, Perseus?
- The very same.

08:57.968 --> 09:00.236
When Perseus was a
baby, his grandfather,

09:00.237 --> 09:03.639
King Acrisius of Argos,
tried to murder him.

09:03.640 --> 09:06.408
The Oracle of Delphi

09:06.409 --> 09:09.211
forged a prophecy cube,

09:09.212 --> 09:11.313
saying that Perseus
would try to kill him

09:11.314 --> 09:15.116
so his grandfather tried to kill
him before he had the chance.

09:16.352 --> 09:18.454
See?

09:18.455 --> 09:21.423
King Acrisius' prophecy
cube, the same patterns.

09:21.424 --> 09:25.060
Yeah, and the king cast
Perseus and his mother

09:25.061 --> 09:26.629
out to sea in a wooden chest,

09:26.630 --> 09:27.893
they were rescued by fishermen,

09:27.894 --> 09:30.866
but Perseus grew up
hating his grandfather

09:30.867 --> 09:32.010
because of what he had done.

09:32.011 --> 09:33.182
And when he was old enough,

09:33.183 --> 09:35.237
Perseus returned to
Argos and killed the king.

09:35.238 --> 09:36.572
The moral of the story being,

09:36.573 --> 09:38.474
when the king saw the prophecy,

09:38.475 --> 09:40.576
it became self-fulfilling.

09:40.577 --> 09:44.146
Trying to defeat it
only made it come true.

09:44.147 --> 09:46.215
What does any of this
have to do with me?

09:46.216 --> 09:48.350
Well, I strongly suspect that this cube

09:48.351 --> 09:51.586
contains a vision of your death.

09:54.390 --> 09:56.225
Well, then, I need to see it.

09:56.226 --> 09:58.694
Didn't you just hear
the story, the king?

09:58.695 --> 10:00.896
If you see your future,
you could be creating

10:00.897 --> 10:02.000
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.333
Any actions you take to avoid it

10:04.334 --> 10:06.035
may actually make it come true.

10:06.036 --> 10:09.572
I'd rather have a heads-up
than be blindsided.

10:09.573 --> 10:12.241
Well, hold it to your forehead

10:12.242 --> 10:15.843
and ask it to show you its truth.

10:20.283 --> 10:23.718
Okay. Show me what you got.

10:25.254 --> 10:27.156
When the last grain of sand

10:27.157 --> 10:29.058
falls from the hourglass,

10:29.059 --> 10:30.893
you shall die by the Reaper's hand

10:30.894 --> 10:33.729
within these Library walls.

10:40.803 --> 10:42.938
I saw my death...

10:42.939 --> 10:45.341
here, in the Library.

10:45.342 --> 10:47.743
No, no. Here, Library, are you sure?

10:47.744 --> 10:49.678
So as long as she's not in the Library

10:49.679 --> 10:51.961
it can't kill her, according
to the rules of the prophecy.

10:51.962 --> 10:53.843
What are we doing? We
gotta get her out of here!

10:53.844 --> 10:55.297
No, you do not. Stay right here.

10:55.298 --> 10:56.819
It is the one safe place.

10:56.820 --> 10:59.622
The Reaper cannot get into
the Library, it won't let him!

10:59.623 --> 11:02.625
What? People break in all the time!

11:02.626 --> 11:06.128
Dulaque, Morgan Le Fay,
Moriarty, Lamia, Prospero!

11:06.129 --> 11:08.364
None of them are the Reaper.

11:08.365 --> 11:10.165
Do you realize how
many hostiles wanted to

11:10.166 --> 11:12.268
assassinate Librarians
over the centuries?

11:12.269 --> 11:16.839
The Library was designed to
be specifically Reaper-proof.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.074
I saw him kill me right here.

11:19.075 --> 11:21.176
Right here is the
last place I should be.

11:21.177 --> 11:24.212
- No, there's some other...
- Oh, incoming!

11:28.817 --> 11:31.487
All the clippings are about
one high school in Seattle.

11:31.488 --> 11:32.516
Mayfield High.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.456
Maybe the Library's
trying to help Baird,

11:34.457 --> 11:35.891
send her somewhere safe?

11:35.892 --> 11:37.826
"17 Mayfield High Students

11:37.827 --> 11:39.662
Get Best Exam Results In State."

11:39.663 --> 11:41.597
"Families of 17 Mayfield High Students

11:41.598 --> 11:43.198
Win 17 State Lotteries"?

11:43.199 --> 11:44.622
Sounds like my kind of high school.

11:44.623 --> 11:45.941
"Tyson Lopez, Swim Team Captain,

11:45.942 --> 11:47.603
Wins Olympic Training Experience."

11:47.604 --> 11:49.638
That's a whole lot of
luck for one high school.

11:49.639 --> 11:51.440
Maybe a bit of good luck's what I need.

11:51.441 --> 11:53.375
Jenkins! Fire up the back door.

11:53.376 --> 11:57.079
Ah, please. Eve, you cannot beat fate.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.516
Stay here. The Library can
protect you from the Reaper.

12:00.517 --> 12:01.483
But it doesn't.

12:01.484 --> 12:03.852
I saw myself die, here in the Library.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.521
No, please. Do not let one

12:05.522 --> 12:07.990
glimpse of foresight
cloud your judgment.

12:07.991 --> 12:10.326
Remember King Acrisius.

12:10.327 --> 12:12.461
I'm a soldier, a Guardian.

12:12.462 --> 12:15.130
I can't just sit back and wait
for fate to catch up to me.

12:15.131 --> 12:18.099
Now open it up, Skippy.

12:21.036 --> 12:24.073
How did we get here?
This isn't Mayfield High.

12:24.074 --> 12:26.675
I'm running and he's still caught me.

12:26.676 --> 12:28.510
Not yet.

12:28.511 --> 12:30.212
Not while he's behind that wall.

12:30.213 --> 12:31.814
If there is a door,

12:31.815 --> 12:34.283
I'll find it way before
"Mr. Stabby Fingers" does.

12:39.021 --> 12:41.956
Ignore it. He's just
trying to psyche you out.

13:02.722 --> 13:03.957
What is that thing?

13:03.958 --> 13:06.326
Get behind me.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.928
No, you get behind me.
I know what I'm doing.

13:08.929 --> 13:11.331
Demonio! It's the devil.

13:11.332 --> 13:15.435
I said get behind me!
It's me he wants, me.

13:18.072 --> 13:21.808
Caramba. Has it stalled?

13:21.809 --> 13:24.511
Why aren't you attacking?

13:24.512 --> 13:26.179
What's your game?

13:26.180 --> 13:27.947
If he's stopped, he's stopped.

13:27.948 --> 13:29.931
Let's not argue with Mr.
Stabby Fingers right now.

13:29.932 --> 13:32.399
Keep searching for the door.

13:33.219 --> 13:34.754
Look for irregularities.

13:34.755 --> 13:36.656
If Cassandra was here, she'd spot it.

13:36.657 --> 13:39.692
- Who's Cassandra?
- Cassandra.

13:39.693 --> 13:42.328
Cassandra, the goggles!
I know where she is.

13:50.837 --> 13:54.240
All right, Mayfield
High School, here we are.

13:54.241 --> 13:56.342
The Library sent us here.

13:56.343 --> 13:58.545
- What's safe about a high school?
- Nothing.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.281
It's the most dangerous
environment known to mankind.

14:01.282 --> 14:02.282
Geek.

14:02.283 --> 14:04.784
Hey, leave him alone!

14:04.785 --> 14:06.519
You pick on him, I'll pick on you.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.087
It's the kid from the clippings book.

14:10.623 --> 14:13.860
Tyson Lopez?

14:13.861 --> 14:17.263
Yeah, oh, hey! What did I win now?

14:17.264 --> 14:19.199
Who are you people?

14:19.200 --> 14:21.367
Do you have permission
to be on school grounds?

14:21.368 --> 14:24.671
Absolutely we do. We're the Librarians.

14:24.672 --> 14:26.573
I don't think so.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.675
None of you is Mrs. Jennings.

14:28.676 --> 14:32.512
Now, if you don't show me some
ID in the next five seconds,

14:32.513 --> 14:34.914
I'm calling the police.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.249
Your test results are amazing.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.719
I mean, 17 seniors
jumping from D and F grades

14:39.720 --> 14:40.954
to across-the-board A-plus?

14:40.955 --> 14:42.778
I mean, in one student
that would be unlikely,

14:42.779 --> 14:46.426
but in 17, I mean the
odds are what, 0.02%?

14:46.427 --> 14:49.061
You're from the school board?

14:51.064 --> 14:52.764
What do you think?

14:56.035 --> 15:00.240
What can I say? Since I took over
the running of this troubled school,

15:00.241 --> 15:01.374
I've been turning it around.

15:01.375 --> 15:04.777
So your explanation for
having impossible grades

15:04.778 --> 15:07.513
is that you "Oh,
Captain, my Captain" them?

15:07.514 --> 15:08.977
I have nothing to hide.

15:08.978 --> 15:10.183
My students' success

15:10.184 --> 15:12.719
comes from the hard work
ethic we instill in them.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.888
Uh, and the fact that
they all won the lottery?

15:15.889 --> 15:17.690
- Coincidence.
- No coincidence.

15:17.691 --> 15:20.526
Coincidence is dating
two girls at the same time

15:20.527 --> 15:22.195
and then finding out they're sisters.

15:22.196 --> 15:23.730
By the way, bad idea.

15:23.731 --> 15:25.098
It is a coincidence.

15:25.099 --> 15:28.334
What are you suggesting?
That they used a crystal ball?

15:29.937 --> 15:32.772
What about a cube? About this
big, glass covered in symbols?

15:32.773 --> 15:34.916
I think I'd like to have a
parent or guardian present.

15:34.917 --> 15:36.175
A Guardian's right here, mate.

15:36.176 --> 15:38.544
Is there anything else that connects

15:38.545 --> 15:41.648
these 17 extremely lucky
students to each other?

15:41.649 --> 15:43.782
Well, I suppose...

15:45.518 --> 15:48.120
They're all on the swim team.

15:49.422 --> 15:50.990
Well, with the exams,

15:50.991 --> 15:52.759
the questions were ones I sort of knew.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.661
Right. Right, right, right.

15:57.264 --> 16:00.566
I'm getting some crazy
readings off this pool.

16:00.567 --> 16:02.468
What is that thing?

16:02.469 --> 16:04.237
Uh, this is a... matriculator.

16:04.238 --> 16:06.472
Yeah, it's used for matriculating.

16:06.473 --> 16:09.676
It's cutting-edge
school board equipment.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.611
Hey, and what about the lottery, Tyson?

16:11.612 --> 16:14.213
I won first prize in a sports lottery,

16:14.214 --> 16:17.417
a training week at the
Olympic swim center in Greece.

16:17.418 --> 16:19.552
I mean, I've never even
been out of Seattle before,

16:19.553 --> 16:23.323
and there was me,
swimming on Mt. Parnassus.

16:23.324 --> 16:25.857
Tyson, are you leaking?

16:30.430 --> 16:31.731
What's with the water?

16:31.732 --> 16:35.468
Nothing. I was just thirsty.

16:35.469 --> 16:39.105
Yeah, I'm guessing you heard
about the legend of Mt. Parnassus.

16:39.106 --> 16:40.473
The lake water's supposed to give

16:40.474 --> 16:42.675
anybody who bathes in it special powers.

16:42.676 --> 16:43.796
I just thought...

16:43.797 --> 16:45.677
Thought you'd bring back
some water from Greece,

16:45.678 --> 16:47.421
put it in the pool,
see if you could improve

16:47.422 --> 16:48.981
the performance of the swim team?

16:48.982 --> 16:52.051
Yeah, but it didn't work.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.620
I don't think the water
really does anything.

16:57.358 --> 16:59.025
Oh, ignore those.

16:59.026 --> 17:01.928
- Those are nothing.
- Nothing?

17:01.929 --> 17:05.063
Awful lot of magic on
these goggles to be nothing.

17:19.244 --> 17:21.446
I saw a vision of the future.

17:21.448 --> 17:25.351
I was opening a big door.
It had a Medusa on it.

17:25.352 --> 17:26.586
I had a black eye!

17:26.587 --> 17:28.821
Yeah, what I saw, horrifying.

17:28.822 --> 17:31.758
I was gonna give one
of these to the museum.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.459
Don't worry, baby.

17:33.460 --> 17:35.395
- Daddy's never gonna let you go.
- Wow...

17:35.396 --> 17:37.397
Goggles that can see the future,

17:37.398 --> 17:39.365
and the entire swim team has goggles?

17:39.366 --> 17:42.368
That's how you knew the lottery
numbers and the exam answers.

17:42.369 --> 17:46.339
No! Well, maybe, sort of.

17:46.340 --> 17:48.307
A bit.

17:48.308 --> 17:49.183
Am I in trouble?

17:49.184 --> 17:51.711
What the hell are you
people talking about?

17:51.712 --> 17:53.513
Take these back to
Jenkins, run some tests.

17:53.514 --> 17:55.381
Got it. Be safe.

17:55.382 --> 17:56.516
What sort of tests

17:56.517 --> 18:00.386
do legitimate librarians
run on swimming goggles?

18:00.387 --> 18:04.157
What's that sound?

18:05.759 --> 18:07.425
Get out of here! Run!

18:10.497 --> 18:12.799
Go back! Go back!

18:12.800 --> 18:13.965
Go back!

18:20.606 --> 18:23.943
So then we fell in the
pool and then woke up here.

18:23.944 --> 18:26.212
I remember now. We must've teleported.

18:26.213 --> 18:28.014
That's why our memories are fritzed.

18:28.015 --> 18:29.816
Tyson, goggles.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.121
If there's a door in here,
we'd find it eventually, right?

18:32.122 --> 18:33.453
Let's see how we do it.

18:33.454 --> 18:35.488
Make a self-fulfilling prophecy.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.455
Why not?

18:44.832 --> 18:46.831
Do you smell incense?

18:48.000 --> 18:51.803
I've seen how we do it. It's here.

19:00.914 --> 19:03.515
Come on! Everybody out.

19:05.418 --> 19:08.287
You smell incense?

19:08.288 --> 19:12.457
Oh, I hate prophecy more
than I hate time travel.

19:15.194 --> 19:17.495
Not dead yet.

19:20.867 --> 19:22.702
Is everybody here?

19:22.703 --> 19:24.036
Everybody okay?

19:24.037 --> 19:26.572
At least we're drying off a little now,

19:26.573 --> 19:27.907
to look on the bright side.

19:27.908 --> 19:30.109
Everybody except Nina.

19:30.110 --> 19:31.577
You still look pretty soaked.

19:31.578 --> 19:33.746
Eh, I'm a cleaning
lady in a high school.

19:33.747 --> 19:35.848
I've dealt with worse.

19:35.849 --> 19:37.617
From here on, we move forward as a team.

19:37.618 --> 19:39.986
Everyone stick together. Be careful.

19:41.855 --> 19:43.289
Stone!

19:43.290 --> 19:44.323
- Baird!
- Colonel!

19:44.324 --> 19:45.858
Stone! Jones!

19:45.859 --> 19:47.493
- Baird!
- Colonel?

19:47.494 --> 19:48.694
Stone!

19:48.695 --> 19:50.630
- Baird!
- Colonel!

19:50.631 --> 19:52.832
Jones!

19:52.833 --> 19:54.567
It's no good, it's no good.

19:54.568 --> 19:58.603
All right, we keep moving,
we'll catch up with 'em.

20:00.473 --> 20:02.308
There's two exits.

20:02.309 --> 20:04.243
- Which door do we take?
- There's a message.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.245
It's in Greek. Anyone here read Greek?

20:06.246 --> 20:09.749
Oh, I do. I studied at Cambridge.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.586
Well, come on! Time to pick a door.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.154
It doesn't say which is which,

20:15.155 --> 20:17.290
only that one door is the exit,

20:17.291 --> 20:20.593
and the other leads to...

20:20.594 --> 20:22.795
certain death.

20:28.302 --> 20:30.803
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What?

20:38.312 --> 20:41.815
It says "This room
is the Zeus challenge.

20:41.816 --> 20:45.919
Step wisely or suffer
the wrath of Zeus."

20:45.920 --> 20:47.354
What's the wrath of Zeus?

20:52.993 --> 20:54.862
Seriously. You had to ask?

20:54.863 --> 20:56.630
All right, we gotta cross this floor.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.899
You step on the wrong square, zap.

20:58.900 --> 21:02.136
How do we tell the zap squares
from the non-zap squares?

21:02.137 --> 21:05.239
Hey, "Gold will lead the way."

21:05.240 --> 21:07.940
Gold? Who's got...

21:09.877 --> 21:12.212
No, no, no, no. Back off, Stone.

21:12.213 --> 21:14.081
You are not flogging any of my gold.

21:14.082 --> 21:16.116
Amazing.

21:16.117 --> 21:21.255
Plastic lenses in these
utterly normal swimming goggles

21:21.256 --> 21:23.657
have somehow been transmuted

21:23.658 --> 21:25.492
into prophecy glass.

21:25.493 --> 21:29.696
Tyson was putting water from
Mt. Parnassus into the pool.

21:29.697 --> 21:31.899
What if the water brought
back something with it?

21:31.900 --> 21:34.901
I'm gonna call Baird and
see if she can get a sample.

21:35.936 --> 21:38.004
- She's not answering.
- Hmm.

21:39.106 --> 21:40.673
Jenkins, she's not answering.

21:54.888 --> 21:57.223
Oh.

22:21.248 --> 22:24.717
Another prophecy cube.

22:27.187 --> 22:30.057
Darse prisa! Pick one, just pick!

22:30.058 --> 22:32.626
There must be a clue! Come on, think.

22:32.627 --> 22:35.462
We need more information.
We fell in the pool.

22:35.463 --> 22:38.999
We woke up here.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.368
Except Nina, where
were you when we fell?

22:41.369 --> 22:42.803
Cleaning the pool.

22:42.804 --> 22:44.104
You fell in the water with us?

22:44.105 --> 22:45.772
Si, claro! Of course!

22:45.773 --> 22:48.008
No one notices the cleaning lady.

22:48.009 --> 22:51.378
No, it's not my time yet.

22:51.379 --> 22:54.348
It's not my time yet.

22:54.349 --> 22:57.251
You can't kill me
until the sand runs out

22:57.252 --> 22:59.853
which means whatever door I
pick must be the correct one.

22:59.854 --> 23:02.422
Maybe you don't die, but we
could all get chopped to bits.

23:02.423 --> 23:04.825
Lady, if you're gonna pick, pick quick.

23:04.826 --> 23:08.562
Left, right, left! Come on!

23:08.563 --> 23:10.931
The thing about this gold is
that it's particularly nice.

23:10.932 --> 23:12.532
I mean, the thought of it getting zapped

23:12.533 --> 23:14.054
isn't exactly what I'm trying to go...

23:14.055 --> 23:15.358
Let me ask you a question, okay?

23:15.359 --> 23:17.237
What does Ezekiel Jones love more, hmm?

23:17.238 --> 23:19.773
Gold...

23:19.774 --> 23:22.509
or Ezekiel Jones?

23:22.510 --> 23:23.710
Point taken.

23:23.711 --> 23:26.980
Eenie, meenie, miney, Moe.

23:28.216 --> 23:30.217
Ooh, it worked. It's non-zap.

23:30.218 --> 23:32.119
- Right.
- Step one.

23:32.120 --> 23:35.821
Catch the Reaper by his toe.

23:39.026 --> 23:40.928
My beautiful innocent gold!

23:40.929 --> 23:44.196
All right, get over it. Next square!

23:48.268 --> 23:50.237
Zeus!

23:50.238 --> 23:52.572
Red, blue.

23:52.573 --> 23:54.775
A second prophecy cube.

23:54.776 --> 23:57.100
You know what this makes me want to do?

23:57.101 --> 23:57.844
What?

23:57.845 --> 24:01.048
Makes me want to go,

24:01.049 --> 24:02.849
"Hmm."

24:02.850 --> 24:05.585
Okay, I think I found two ways

24:05.586 --> 24:07.521
that a self-fulfilling
prophecy can be broken.

24:07.522 --> 24:09.589
One, you get someone
outside of the prophecy

24:09.590 --> 24:11.373
to intervene and change
the course of events.

24:11.374 --> 24:13.860
And two, you create an even bigger

24:13.861 --> 24:17.030
self-fulfilling prophecy
around the first.

24:17.031 --> 24:19.466
Yes.

24:19.467 --> 24:22.469
Many centuries ago the
Oracle forged a prophecy cube

24:22.470 --> 24:24.204
and she saw herself within it.

24:24.205 --> 24:25.939
She was being murdered

24:25.940 --> 24:29.009
by one of her 33 high priestesses,

24:29.010 --> 24:31.278
though she couldn't see which one.

24:31.279 --> 24:34.348
So she forged new prophecy cubes,

24:34.349 --> 24:36.483
one for each of the priestesses,

24:36.484 --> 24:38.919
containing a vision of them

24:38.920 --> 24:42.889
dying at the hands of
the person they married.

24:42.890 --> 24:45.424
So how did she link the prophecies?

24:48.428 --> 24:50.530
She married each of the priestesses,

24:50.531 --> 24:52.733
meaning that the
Oracle became the person

24:52.734 --> 24:54.167
prophesied to kill each of them,

24:54.168 --> 24:56.303
meaning that they couldn't kill her,

24:56.304 --> 24:58.739
because otherwise she
wouldn't be alive to kill them.

24:58.740 --> 25:00.640
My brain just exploded.

25:00.641 --> 25:02.109
But exactly right.

25:02.110 --> 25:05.278
The Oracle murdered her
wives on their wedding night,

25:05.279 --> 25:08.949
hence the prophecy cube
containing her death exploded.

25:08.950 --> 25:10.650
The prophecy was broken.

25:10.651 --> 25:12.152
- That's brutal.
- Yes.

25:12.153 --> 25:15.622
So what we have to do is
find an overriding prophecy,

25:15.623 --> 25:18.225
something bigger than
the death of a Guardian,

25:18.226 --> 25:21.628
or Colonel Baird will
die in short order.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.399
Ooh! Nice.

25:28.935 --> 25:31.704
Nope, definitely this one.

25:33.407 --> 25:35.342
- I'm gonna die here.
- You're not gonna die.

25:35.343 --> 25:37.377
All right? Think positive.

25:37.378 --> 25:40.113
We're halfway across. Halfway across.

25:40.114 --> 25:41.848
But we're down to our last coin,

25:41.849 --> 25:44.217
which allows us only one mistake.

25:44.218 --> 25:47.721
Stone, this is the coin from my vision,

25:47.722 --> 25:49.790
the one that I give to
a museum in the future,

25:49.791 --> 25:53.660
and that means, if I give this
coin to a museum in the future,

25:53.661 --> 25:55.729
It cannot be destroyed today.

25:55.730 --> 25:58.632
Exactly, which means no matter
which square I throw this on,

25:58.633 --> 26:00.700
it has to be safe.

26:02.103 --> 26:04.538
- You're amazing!
- I know I am.

26:04.539 --> 26:06.939
- Bite me, Zeus!
- All right.

26:08.622 --> 26:10.143
You're worried about them, aren't you?

26:10.144 --> 26:11.978
Oh, I'm always worried about them.

26:11.979 --> 26:13.713
I'm their Guardian.

26:13.714 --> 26:16.583
You mean you look after them?

26:16.584 --> 26:18.452
Yep, and I know what you're gonna say,

26:18.453 --> 26:19.953
I sound like their nanny.

26:19.954 --> 26:22.489
Oh, please. Good leaders care

26:22.490 --> 26:23.790
about the people they lead.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.058
That's what good leadership is.

26:25.059 --> 26:27.127
Like Mr. Fairbrother.

26:27.128 --> 26:28.595
The kids are terrified of him,

26:28.596 --> 26:30.664
but he loves them like his own children,

26:30.665 --> 26:34.768
and nobody needs goggles made
of prophecy glass to see that.

26:34.769 --> 26:36.969
That's very kind of you, Nina.

26:50.951 --> 26:53.653
There's a weapons room.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.621
They were attacking me.

26:56.790 --> 26:59.426
Over my dead body.

26:59.427 --> 27:02.429
Right, right. So what's the plan?

27:02.430 --> 27:06.766
Well, we find the Colonel and
escape this crystal funhouse.

27:06.767 --> 27:09.702
Let's have a look-see
behind door number one.

27:20.213 --> 27:23.083
It's Baird. She's gone mental.

27:23.084 --> 27:24.583
Come on.

27:35.262 --> 27:37.597
It's arming itself.

27:37.598 --> 27:39.566
You're not actually Colonel Baird.

27:39.567 --> 27:41.067
You're in disguise.

27:41.068 --> 27:43.069
You're Zeus, aren't you?

27:43.070 --> 27:45.205
Jones, what? Of course, I'm me.

27:45.206 --> 27:46.806
The Baird we know would never attack us.

27:46.830 --> 27:49.309
And the Stone and Ezekiel I
know would never attack me.

27:49.310 --> 27:51.311
Don't listen to it! Grab sharp things!

27:51.312 --> 27:53.513
Do not touch those
weapons, I'm warning you.

27:53.514 --> 27:55.582
Yeah? Well...

27:55.583 --> 27:57.717
warn this! Oop...!

28:08.654 --> 28:09.754
Agh-hh...!

28:11.924 --> 28:16.327
Why is heavy metal so bloody heavy?

28:17.629 --> 28:19.264
We know you're gonna attack us.

28:19.265 --> 28:20.299
We saw it in the future.

28:20.300 --> 28:22.534
Yeah, well, I saw the future too,

28:22.535 --> 28:24.135
and I saw you attacking me.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.639
- Why would I attack you?
- Why would I attack you?

28:33.079 --> 28:34.947
Wait, wait!

28:34.948 --> 28:36.782
The only reason you're
fighting right now

28:36.783 --> 28:38.884
is because you saw yourselves doing it.

28:38.885 --> 28:41.786
Right? So just don't do it!

28:42.721 --> 28:44.623
I hate prophecy.

28:44.624 --> 28:48.327
But silver lining, Tyson's right.

28:48.328 --> 28:50.229
He just proved that it can be broken.

28:50.230 --> 28:51.230
It can be broken!

28:51.231 --> 28:52.898
The only way to break a prophecy

28:52.899 --> 28:55.400
is with a bigger prophecy,

28:55.401 --> 28:58.804
or if someone outside
the prophecy intervenes.

28:58.805 --> 29:01.573
I guarantee you neither one of
you saw Tyson in your vision.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.475
Tyson, I'm impressed.

29:03.476 --> 29:06.311
That was some excellent
lateral thinking.

29:06.312 --> 29:09.947
The door with the Medusa
head from my vision.

29:11.316 --> 29:12.484
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:12.485 --> 29:14.987
When I opened this
door, I had a black eye.

29:14.988 --> 29:17.189
Something has to happen
to me before I can open it.

29:17.190 --> 29:18.824
- Who cares?
- No, listen.

29:18.825 --> 29:21.093
I was predestined to have a black eye.

29:21.094 --> 29:22.961
Show some respect for predestiny.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.363
Show a little respect for me

29:24.364 --> 29:26.198
not getting killed by that thing.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.234
Come on, open the door, Stone.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.936
Not until I get hit in the face.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.104
I'll hit you in the face.

29:32.105 --> 29:33.805
You're not my predestiny.

29:33.806 --> 29:35.206
You don't count.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.343
Are you sure?

29:38.344 --> 29:40.379
- Are you sure?
- Wouldn't work on me.

29:40.380 --> 29:42.014
Part of being immortal, it seems,

29:42.015 --> 29:44.283
is that we can never
tell what is to come.

29:44.284 --> 29:46.418
Okay, well, then,

29:46.419 --> 29:50.688
I guess there's only one way
to find out who it's meant for.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.504
Show me what you got.

30:05.505 --> 30:07.906
The Oracle of Delphi shall die

30:07.907 --> 30:11.610
after she next bathes
in the waters of Delphi.

30:11.611 --> 30:14.279
I, the Oracle of Delphi,

30:14.280 --> 30:17.516
prophesy my own demise.

30:17.517 --> 30:19.184
Oh! Oh!

30:19.185 --> 30:20.885
Oh!

30:22.521 --> 30:25.090
- What did you see?
- The Oracle herself.

30:25.091 --> 30:27.359
She prophesied her own death.

30:27.360 --> 30:30.562
Wait, why would she
prophesy her own death again?

30:30.563 --> 30:33.665
She can't control destiny.
She can only interpret it.

30:33.666 --> 30:38.103
And this prophecy is crystal clear.

30:38.104 --> 30:40.339
Stone, I'll open the door.

30:40.340 --> 30:43.875
It's has to be me, okay? It's
just... it's not time yet!

30:46.746 --> 30:48.180
Ah, you hear that sound?

30:48.181 --> 30:50.716
That is the sound of it being time yet!

30:54.320 --> 30:56.321
Come on, come on, come
on! Hurry up, Stone!

30:58.091 --> 31:00.058
Please! Open the door!

31:00.059 --> 31:01.559
We don't have time for this.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.731
Uh, yeah, all right.
It's heavy, back up.

31:05.732 --> 31:07.933
Tenga cuidado! It's coming!

31:07.934 --> 31:11.136
- Stone.
- It's just... I don't like cheating fate.

31:11.137 --> 31:14.940
- Stone!
- All right!

31:14.941 --> 31:16.775
Oh, there's your black eye.

31:16.776 --> 31:18.509
Go, go!

31:31.423 --> 31:33.691
Oh, Que DIA!

31:35.026 --> 31:37.462
- Almost out of time.
- No.

31:37.463 --> 31:40.432
You are not in the Library.
That's why you're safe.

31:40.433 --> 31:43.335
- That's why he hasn't attacked yet.
- Fingers crossed.

31:43.336 --> 31:45.279
Looks like we hit a dead
end. There's no way out.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.140
Can't we just do the
future, door-find-y thingy,

31:48.141 --> 31:49.708
and use the prophecy glass?

31:49.709 --> 31:51.510
What was prophecy glass?

31:51.511 --> 31:55.479
It's what the lenses in the
goggles have become once...

31:57.416 --> 31:59.651
Nina?

31:59.652 --> 32:02.087
Why didn't you ask
what prophecy glass is?

32:02.088 --> 32:04.089
Because you called it that already.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.091
No, I didn't. Not in front of you.

32:06.092 --> 32:09.194
None of us ever used that phrase
in front of you, but you did.

32:09.195 --> 32:11.730
You said no one needs
goggles made of prophecy glass

32:11.731 --> 32:14.299
to see that Principal
Fairbrother loves his students.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.401
How do you know what prophecy glass is?

32:16.402 --> 32:18.336
I... well, I...

32:18.337 --> 32:21.406
And you said you were cleaning
the pool when we fell in,

32:21.407 --> 32:24.443
but you weren't there.

32:24.444 --> 32:27.579
Yeah, and how come the
rest of us have dried off,

32:27.580 --> 32:30.214
and you're still soaking wet?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.517
I just figured out who you are.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.222
You're the Oracle of Delphi.

32:37.223 --> 32:39.990
Oh, I... I...

32:49.201 --> 32:53.737
Well, I so enjoyed
being poor little Nina.

32:59.911 --> 33:03.782
I'm sorry, Eve. I think
you're simply marvelous.

33:03.783 --> 33:05.884
But as much as I love you,

33:05.885 --> 33:08.086
I love me more.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.955
And your time's almost up.

33:09.956 --> 33:12.290
But I'm not in the Library.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.092
Darling, you really should have done

33:14.093 --> 33:16.328
what old Galahad said and stayed put.

33:16.329 --> 33:19.965
The Library was the one safe
place I couldn't reach you

33:19.966 --> 33:23.400
and then, you went and
brought us all inside.

33:24.669 --> 33:28.106
- What do you mean?
- This is a prophecy cube.

33:28.107 --> 33:30.808
My prophecy cube.

33:54.232 --> 33:58.950
We've been in the Library all along.

34:00.129 --> 34:02.471
What do you mean, we're
in your prophecy cube?

34:02.472 --> 34:04.941
My death, too, was foretold.

34:04.942 --> 34:07.577
After my next bath in
the waters of Delphi.

34:07.578 --> 34:09.579
It's written her prophetic powers

34:09.580 --> 34:12.848
come from bathing daily at the
rivers and lakes around her home.

34:12.849 --> 34:14.984
Yes, darling.

34:14.985 --> 34:17.753
And so, the only way to prevent my death

34:17.754 --> 34:21.324
was to create an even
bigger prophecy to negate it.

34:21.324 --> 34:23.458
I'm your bigger prophecy?

34:23.460 --> 34:26.329
If only I'd stayed clear
of the waters of Delphi

34:26.330 --> 34:28.531
I could have avoided all this.

34:28.532 --> 34:31.367
But destiny has a way
of catching up with you.

34:31.368 --> 34:34.469
- So you ran from Greece?
- To Seattle.

34:34.471 --> 34:36.806
What could be further away?

34:36.806 --> 34:40.176
I still had to bathe
daily in sacred waters

34:40.177 --> 34:42.043
to maintain my power,

34:42.045 --> 34:44.347
but as long as they weren't
the waters of Delphi,

34:44.348 --> 34:46.081
I would be just fine.

34:46.083 --> 34:49.118
You were the source of power
in the lake water at Delphi.

34:49.119 --> 34:52.088
And since you're bathing in
the high school swimming pool...

34:52.089 --> 34:54.857
I filled it with the powers of prophecy.

34:54.858 --> 34:58.794
That's why Jones got those
weird readings by the pool.

34:58.795 --> 35:00.830
Your magic is in the water.

35:00.831 --> 35:04.467
That's why the goggles
turned to prophecy glass.

35:04.468 --> 35:07.003
So because of Mrs. Mitrani,

35:07.004 --> 35:08.804
I won my trip to Mt. Parnassus?

35:08.805 --> 35:12.541
Yes, sweetheart! But do keep up.

35:12.542 --> 35:14.977
I'm so not Mrs. Mitrani.

35:14.978 --> 35:17.947
Wait, you came to Seattle.

35:17.948 --> 35:19.915
You got to go to Mt. Parnassus.

35:19.916 --> 35:23.786
What's in Mt. Parnassus? Delphi.

35:23.787 --> 35:26.489
Tyson brought Delphi water
and he put it in the pool.

35:26.490 --> 35:29.392
So you ran all the way to Seattle

35:29.393 --> 35:31.927
and you still ended up in Delphi water?

35:31.928 --> 35:33.696
Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy.

35:33.697 --> 35:36.265
Yes, thanks for that, Tyson.

35:36.266 --> 35:38.034
I had to stay in that pool for days

35:38.035 --> 35:39.635
waiting for you all to come.

35:39.636 --> 35:42.204
And I still am bathing, technically.

35:42.205 --> 35:46.342
As long as I remain wet, I don't die

35:46.343 --> 35:48.978
till bath time's over. But by then,

35:48.979 --> 35:50.379
Eve will be dead,

35:50.380 --> 35:51.483
and the power of your death

35:51.484 --> 35:54.116
will shatter this prophecy cube,

35:54.117 --> 35:56.619
and my destiny will be averted.

35:56.620 --> 36:01.323
I win again. You can't
fight the Reaper, Eve.

36:01.324 --> 36:03.559
He must always have his kill.

36:06.929 --> 36:09.265
You want a big death?

36:09.266 --> 36:11.467
How about a Librarian?

36:11.468 --> 36:13.436
Take me.

36:13.437 --> 36:15.604
Take me, too. Yeah.

36:15.605 --> 36:19.008
Two Librarians outweighs
one Guardian any day!

36:19.009 --> 36:21.544
That's very noble.

36:21.545 --> 36:25.547
But two Librarians do
not equal one Guardian.

36:28.584 --> 36:30.986
The death of a thousand Librarians

36:30.987 --> 36:33.055
would not equal this Guardian.

36:33.056 --> 36:35.424
What do you mean, "this Guardian"?

36:35.425 --> 36:38.994
You really have no idea how
important you are, do you?

36:38.995 --> 36:41.030
The future you've got coming.

36:41.031 --> 36:43.399
Well, the future I'm
going to steal from you.

36:43.400 --> 36:46.802
Oh, the energy your death will release,

36:46.803 --> 36:48.704
all that destiny denied.

36:48.705 --> 36:49.939
What have I got coming?

36:49.940 --> 36:52.808
Nothing. But had you lived...

36:52.809 --> 36:55.878
Oh, if Eve Baird had lived,

36:55.879 --> 37:00.316
she would've changed the
fate of the Library forever.

37:00.317 --> 37:03.385
But instead, she will die here,

37:03.386 --> 37:05.187
so that I might live.

37:05.188 --> 37:07.490
Thank you for your sacrifice.

37:07.491 --> 37:09.725
No! We need her.

37:09.726 --> 37:11.093
I need her more.

37:11.094 --> 37:13.929
Two ways to break a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

37:13.930 --> 37:17.433
One, you attach a bigger
prophecy to the first.

37:17.434 --> 37:18.901
Yes, already did that.

37:18.902 --> 37:23.272
Two, find someone outside
the prophecy to intervene.

37:23.273 --> 37:26.909
I have to die here in the Library.

37:26.910 --> 37:30.879
Jenkins, throw the blue
cube out the back door!

37:34.785 --> 37:37.453
Please! He can't hear you.

37:37.454 --> 37:40.656
Why does everyone always call for help?

37:40.657 --> 37:43.092
He's the world's oldest soldier.

37:43.093 --> 37:45.461
You think he needs to be able to hear me

37:45.462 --> 37:47.495
to understand what I'm saying?

38:04.013 --> 38:09.084
- It's Morse code.
- Yes, it is.

38:09.085 --> 38:11.687
"Throw the blue cube..."

38:11.688 --> 38:14.390
What are you doing? What is that?

38:14.391 --> 38:17.493
Huh, a useless present,

38:17.494 --> 38:19.862
that's not so useless after all.

38:19.863 --> 38:24.333
"...to the other side of the world...

38:24.334 --> 38:26.001
Skippy."

38:26.002 --> 38:27.970
It's Colonel Baird. Grab the blue cube.

38:27.971 --> 38:29.004
- Oh!
- Unh!

38:41.651 --> 38:42.585
Throw!

38:50.292 --> 38:51.827
No!

38:51.828 --> 38:55.530
Sorry, Nina. Library's closed.

38:59.835 --> 39:04.106
No, you're just a mortal.
You can't cheat fate!

39:04.107 --> 39:08.277
I didn't cheat fate. I cheated you.

39:08.278 --> 39:09.879
But the Reaper must still have his kill,

39:09.880 --> 39:12.948
and, well, look at that,
you're all dried off.

39:12.949 --> 39:14.816
Bath time's over.

39:16.685 --> 39:18.621
No...!

39:18.622 --> 39:20.222
It's empty!

39:20.223 --> 39:24.727
No. No, it's not fair!

39:24.728 --> 39:26.227
Ay, caramb...

39:30.032 --> 39:31.433
Eve Baird...

39:34.137 --> 39:35.536
...released.

39:36.372 --> 39:39.575
Yes! Yes, I did it.

39:39.576 --> 39:41.810
I won the day...

39:41.811 --> 39:45.713
with a makeup mirror!

39:46.582 --> 39:48.317
That's Uluru,

39:48.318 --> 39:50.653
and that's a kangaroo.

39:50.654 --> 39:51.921
Oh, my Lord.

39:51.922 --> 39:53.656
- We're in...
- Australia!

39:53.657 --> 39:56.525
I'm home. But before someone asks me

39:56.526 --> 39:58.126
to "throw another shrimp on the barbie,"

39:58.150 --> 39:59.895
just know I will punch
you in the throat.

39:59.896 --> 40:01.897
Well, can't hang out long, "mate."

40:01.898 --> 40:04.098
You got a museum to donate to.

40:05.567 --> 40:08.370
Jenkins, I should've listened to you.

40:08.371 --> 40:10.506
- I should've stayed put.
- Oh, well,

40:10.507 --> 40:14.043
seems to me you did just fine, Eve.

40:14.044 --> 40:17.145
After all, you are the Guardian.

40:20.082 --> 40:21.850
To the Guardian.

40:21.851 --> 40:24.252
- To Baird.
- Thanks, guys!

40:25.621 --> 40:27.122
And thank you, Flynn,

40:27.123 --> 40:30.392
for this strange, inappropriate,

40:30.393 --> 40:32.995
and ultimately life-saving gift.

40:32.996 --> 40:35.763
Colonel, may I see that?

40:38.100 --> 40:41.502
This is not from Mr. Carson.

40:42.604 --> 40:45.874
This is Mimiko's mirror,

40:45.875 --> 40:48.844
a Japanese shaman queen.

40:48.845 --> 40:51.747
It is one of the
Library's rarest relics.

40:51.748 --> 40:53.415
How did I end up with it?

40:53.416 --> 40:56.085
Well, you asked earlier

40:56.086 --> 40:58.654
if the Guardian guards the Librarians,

40:58.655 --> 41:03.325
who guards the Guardians,
and there is your answer.

41:03.326 --> 41:05.626
The Library does.

41:10.265 --> 41:12.368
Hey, spot me a hundred.

41:12.369 --> 41:14.737
- Why, you're just gonna...?
- I wanna hit the tables.

41:14.738 --> 41:16.572
You? You hitting the tables?

41:16.573 --> 41:18.874
We should go to a show...
