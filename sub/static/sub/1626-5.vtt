00:01.909 --> 00:04.628
Your waitress just went on break, and
I'm just someone who likes dressing

00:04.629 --> 00:07.883
like a polyester hot dog, so I'll
take that whenever you're ready.

00:08.605 --> 00:10.884
There you go.
No rush.

00:11.001 --> 00:15.537
Okay, Mr. Rajeev Guttikonda.

00:15.840 --> 00:19.555
I have to say, that's a pretty
<i>Gutti</i> scheme you got going there,

00:19.557 --> 00:22.292
but I <i>Guttikonda</i>
don't believe it.

00:22.294 --> 00:24.868
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you saying there?

00:24.870 --> 00:27.010
What am I saying there, Boston?

00:27.012 --> 00:29.219
I'm saying I believe you watched
<i>Slumdog Millionaire</i>

00:29.221 --> 00:31.229
on a sticky couch
in your mom's basement,

00:31.231 --> 00:33.467
but I'm not buying
that you're Indian.

00:34.115 --> 00:36.976
So take your fake, East Boston,
Indian accent out of here,

00:36.978 --> 00:38.480
or I'll call the cops.

00:38.482 --> 00:40.890
Dude, stolen credit card,
and you choose to eat here?

00:40.898 --> 00:42.795
That's the real crime.

00:42.797 --> 00:45.164
Hey, Rajeev.

00:45.166 --> 00:47.936
Rajeev, my man.

00:47.938 --> 00:49.874
Rajeev Gudikanda.

00:49.876 --> 00:51.644
You know what?
This one's on me.

00:51.646 --> 00:54.883
[chuckles]
I have trust issues.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.702
That's weird. We still have
three Red Velvets left.

01:11.704 --> 01:14.498
I guess that bulimic girl
didn't come in today.

01:14.850 --> 01:17.033
No, she's here.
She's in the bathroom.

01:18.943 --> 01:23.408
Hmm, if I save these for her,
would that be helping or hurting?

01:23.409 --> 01:24.920
Hey, everybody.

01:24.922 --> 01:27.556
Speaking of hurting,
here comes a pain in my ass.

01:27.637 --> 01:31.031
Han, do you want the last Red Velvet?
The other two are for the bulimic girl.

01:31.032 --> 01:33.044
I made the call.

01:33.073 --> 01:36.580
No more cupcakes for me. I've been
on a juice cleanse for six days.

01:36.581 --> 01:40.888
Han's on the prowl, and I got
to keep this body tight, son.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.536
I'm in the dating pool,
you know.

01:45.537 --> 01:48.272
Yeah, the shallow end.

01:48.273 --> 01:50.680
You know those cleanses
never work, right?

01:50.681 --> 01:54.338
Really?
Then how do you explain this?

01:56.161 --> 02:00.117
I don't know. Am I supposed
to rub it and make a wish?

02:01.826 --> 02:05.051
Not bad for having
three kids, Han.

02:05.357 --> 02:08.190
What? You don't see
my abs coming in?

02:08.402 --> 02:11.769
I see one large ab
coming in.

02:12.184 --> 02:15.238
That's at least a two-pack.

02:15.755 --> 02:20.526
Han, the real Tupac is more
alive than your two-pack.

02:21.577 --> 02:24.371
I'm gonna give this last cupcake
away as a free sample.

02:24.372 --> 02:27.070
My promotional tweets haven't
been getting much love lately.

02:27.071 --> 02:30.389
What'd you say? I black out
whenever you use work words.

02:30.391 --> 02:32.839
All I said was "promotional
tweets" and "sample."

02:32.840 --> 02:34.079
What?

02:35.181 --> 02:39.111
Here you go, ladies, a Max's
homemade cupcake on the house.

02:39.112 --> 02:40.367
Nah, I'm cool.

02:40.368 --> 02:44.004
I'm saving my calories for one
of those fabulous new cronuts.

02:44.006 --> 02:46.673
Plus, cupcakes are so over.

02:47.112 --> 02:50.054
Well, so is <i>blossom,</i> but...

02:52.616 --> 02:56.140
It didn't stop you
from wearing that outfit.

02:56.141 --> 02:59.980
- Those flower power skanks over there...
- "Flower Power skanks."

02:59.981 --> 03:02.908
See, these are words
I recognize and hear.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.490
Anyway, she said
she only cares about cronuts

03:06.491 --> 03:08.191
and that cupcakes are over.

03:08.192 --> 03:11.194
- Cupcakes are classic, right?
- Don't listen to them.

03:11.195 --> 03:13.363
They're wearing
high-waisted jeans.

03:13.364 --> 03:15.703
The only time I like
seeing women's jeans that high

03:15.704 --> 03:17.968
is when I'm giving Han
a wedgie.

03:17.969 --> 03:19.771
Also, what's a cronut?

03:19.958 --> 03:25.618
Cronut is what we called
my Croatian cousin with one testicle.

03:26.098 --> 03:28.656
He hung himself.

03:29.340 --> 03:33.839
Okay, well, in America,
it's a half-croissant, half-doughnut.

03:33.840 --> 03:37.726
They're on the news, Twitter, Instagram.
People can't stop talking about them.

03:37.727 --> 03:41.863
If cronuts had tongues,
they'd be the Miley Cyrus of pastries.

03:41.935 --> 03:44.004
You're right.
They sound stupid.

03:44.005 --> 03:46.955
Stupid delicious.
Where can I get one?

03:46.956 --> 03:49.654
You can only get them
at this one pastry shop in Soho,

03:49.655 --> 03:51.862
and people start lining up
at 4:00 a.m.

03:51.863 --> 03:53.977
Boy, times do change.

03:53.978 --> 03:57.286
Back in the day, 4:00 a.m.
was when people would snort lines,

03:57.287 --> 03:59.250
not stand in 'em.

04:00.506 --> 04:04.265
Who has the time to wait in line
all day for a piece of lame pastry?

04:04.266 --> 04:07.682
Hey, everyone.
I got a cronut.

04:10.742 --> 04:14.547
I waited in line
for two whole days.

04:14.589 --> 04:17.017
Sophie, you bought
into the hype too?

04:17.017 --> 04:20.940
Oh, come on, you know your girl
Sophie is always on trend.

04:20.942 --> 04:22.885
I was the first one
wearing crocs.

04:22.901 --> 04:26.379
I brought the crocs craze
to America.

04:26.632 --> 04:30.675
When I was rich, I sent 10,000 pairs
of crocs to children in Africa.

04:30.676 --> 04:33.378
Why, to make them
less cool?

04:33.379 --> 04:37.311
Look, girls, here I am
in the cronut line.

04:37.386 --> 04:40.052
And here I am still in line.

04:40.053 --> 04:44.952
Oh, and... oh, and here I am
riding a baby elephant.

04:45.161 --> 04:47.895
And here I am
eating a cronut.

04:48.607 --> 04:51.575
Max, as stupid as it is,
we've got to go over there.

04:51.576 --> 04:54.112
We need to figure out
what they have that we don't.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.471
Oh, I'll tell you
what they have.

04:56.472 --> 04:58.414
Cronuts.

05:01.942 --> 05:04.176
Oh, my god.
Look at this line.

05:04.209 --> 05:08.300
I knew we should have gotten here sooner,
but, no, I had to be a good person,

05:08.301 --> 05:12.362
I had to carry that torso man on the
skateboard up the subway stairs.

05:12.363 --> 05:15.112
All this is for a croissant
and a doughnut?

05:15.113 --> 05:16.930
Those things
already existed.

05:16.931 --> 05:19.166
Where was all the fanfare when
I combined the sleeping pill

05:19.167 --> 05:20.701
with the morning after pill
and called it

05:20.702 --> 05:23.036
the "sleep-through-
the-morning-after" pill?

05:23.109 --> 05:25.243
How did these things
get so popular?

05:25.244 --> 05:27.651
There's no science
to this trend stuff.

05:27.652 --> 05:31.888
It's all decided by one bitchy gay guy
typing in his room, making it all up.

05:31.889 --> 05:33.825
Well, then we have to do
some trend research.

05:33.826 --> 05:37.332
We've got to figure out how to make Max's
homemade cupcakes the next cronuts.

05:37.333 --> 05:41.608
I hate all these stupid trends.
Cleanses, cronuts, condoms...

05:42.294 --> 05:44.139
Excuse me, sir,

05:44.163 --> 05:47.314
My name's Caroline.
I'm a trend researcher.

05:47.315 --> 05:50.785
I'm Chuck.
I sell magnets.

05:50.787 --> 05:54.515
What made you want to spend
an entire day in line for cronuts?

05:54.516 --> 05:56.984
I like croissants.
I like doughnuts.

05:56.985 --> 06:00.141
I'm a fat guy.
It all adds up.

06:00.764 --> 06:02.610
That's true.
You are a fat guy.

06:02.611 --> 06:05.195
And there's a doughnut shop
right across the street.

06:05.196 --> 06:07.519
So why don't you just
stop there, get a damn doughnut,

06:07.520 --> 06:11.044
and save yourself the last 200 possibly
life-threatening steps to here?

06:11.045 --> 06:13.895
Look, it's two things
I like put together.

06:13.896 --> 06:15.230
End of story.

06:15.602 --> 06:18.798
That's it, Max.
It's the two things together.

06:18.799 --> 06:20.398
One thing
isn't enough anymore.

06:20.419 --> 06:22.865
Yeah, that's why Oleg’s cousin
hung himself.

06:23.695 --> 06:25.428
I'm serious.

06:25.430 --> 06:27.797
When's the last time
you did just one thing?

06:27.798 --> 06:30.485
Like, watch a movie without
playing a game on your phone?

06:30.486 --> 06:32.018
Magic Mike.

06:32.020 --> 06:34.280
Wait, does playing
with yourself count?

06:34.475 --> 06:36.081
Come on, let's get
to the end of the line.

06:36.082 --> 06:39.322
[scoffs] End of the line...?
That's for rookies.

06:39.323 --> 06:40.792
I'm a line pro.

06:40.803 --> 06:44.820
My mom and I waited in line for
food stamps, Bob Seger lawn seats...

06:44.822 --> 06:47.252
We spent a Saturday
in the "guns for cash" line.

06:47.254 --> 06:49.269
Now that's a line
you don't want to cut in.

06:49.270 --> 06:51.184
Follow my lead.

06:55.908 --> 06:58.676
Hey, man, cronut line.
What do you want to do after this?

06:58.677 --> 07:01.475
[all shouting]

07:01.476 --> 07:04.137
Okay, all right, all right.
Back of the line.

07:04.138 --> 07:06.502
Everybody relax.

07:07.948 --> 07:12.247
Guess my mom being topless had more
to do with my line skills than I thought.

07:12.248 --> 07:15.320
Oh, great.
Look at the cronut line.

07:15.321 --> 07:17.388
I told you
we should have left sooner,

07:17.389 --> 07:20.961
but, no, you said
we had to stay at temple.

07:21.016 --> 07:23.470
You're the rabbi.

07:23.471 --> 07:27.212
Yeah, a career I was forced into because
someone wanted to write his memoir.

07:27.333 --> 07:30.668
We get it, Garry.
You're adopted.

07:34.663 --> 07:37.986
Move up, hon.
You gotta fill the gap.

07:37.987 --> 07:40.885
I would if you would stop
trying to fill my gap.

07:41.011 --> 07:42.593
What difference does it make?

07:42.594 --> 07:44.697
You're still gonna have
the same amount of time to wait.

07:44.698 --> 07:48.018
And then, in 30 years, we're all
gonna die from Wi-Fi cancer.

07:49.095 --> 07:51.211
Okay, let's all
just take a breath.

07:51.212 --> 07:53.111
It looks like we're
gonna be here for a while.

07:53.112 --> 07:55.584
You know what? You're right.
Hi, I'm Jerri.

07:55.585 --> 07:57.795
- And I'm Garry.
- I'm Jerri, he's Garry.

07:57.796 --> 07:59.562
I'm tall, he's small.

07:59.649 --> 08:01.781
Cute, right?
That's our thing.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.910
I'm Caroline,
and this is Max.

08:03.933 --> 08:06.533
That's it.
We don't have a thing.

08:06.535 --> 08:09.725
- So what drew you here today?
- Oh, well, we're trend-chasers.

08:09.726 --> 08:11.693
When something new hits,
we are on it

08:11.694 --> 08:14.094
- ...like sea salt on dark chocolate.
- Hmm.

08:14.113 --> 08:19.043
We did pinkberry, dippin' dots,
kale, quinoa, Kombucha...

08:19.044 --> 08:21.387
All the ka's.
Just 'cause.

08:21.388 --> 08:23.223
[laughter]

08:23.271 --> 08:25.670
Can you tell
we don't have kids?

08:26.063 --> 08:28.664
- She couldn't.
- Garry!

08:28.665 --> 08:32.839
Actually, it's true, and you can
read all about it in his memoir.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.176
It's called...
[snores]

08:35.360 --> 08:38.453
You know what? Jerri, Garry.
I think we got too close too soon.

08:38.455 --> 08:40.323
Maybe we need
a little space.

08:40.404 --> 08:43.236
We got to move up in line
to get away from these people.

08:43.238 --> 08:45.459
Should I just
take my top off?

08:46.509 --> 08:48.860
- Next in line.
- [gasps] It happened!

08:48.861 --> 08:52.458
- We made it to the front of the line!
- We're the front people!

08:53.120 --> 08:55.810
Yeah, we're the front people!
Back people suck!

08:57.340 --> 09:01.044
No, no, I said "back people,"
"back people."

09:01.117 --> 09:03.027
<i>Baruch Hashem.</i>

09:03.028 --> 09:05.383
We loved <i>The Butler.</i>

09:05.619 --> 09:08.487
You know,
we've been through a lot.

09:08.488 --> 09:10.419
Tempers flared,
things were said.

09:10.420 --> 09:13.060
I'm fairly certain
that Dutch guy back there died.

09:13.061 --> 09:15.557
But we made it,
and you guys are good people.

09:15.558 --> 09:17.292
The sea salt of the earth.

09:17.293 --> 09:19.294
- Who's next?
- (all) We are.

09:19.295 --> 09:21.438
I can only take a party of two.
Are all four of you together?

09:21.439 --> 09:22.717
- Nope.
- We don't know them.

09:22.718 --> 09:25.223
- Guys...?
- Cut 'em loose, Gar.

09:25.429 --> 09:27.197
All sold out.
We're closed.

09:27.198 --> 09:29.798
I know you're driven mad
with the power of being

09:29.799 --> 09:31.598
a doorman at a bakery,
but come on!

09:31.798 --> 09:34.767
Max, you know what I want
more than anything?

09:34.768 --> 09:37.566
To kill Jerri and Garry?
'Cause I'm totally on board.

09:37.644 --> 09:40.649
No, I want our business
to have a line.

09:40.659 --> 09:41.993
I want to sell out.

09:41.994 --> 09:44.571
I want people to turn against
each other for our product.

09:44.572 --> 09:46.939
Again, I could
just take my top off.

09:46.958 --> 09:49.923
I know, and thank you.
We have that in our back pocket.

09:50.128 --> 09:52.089
But I have an idea
we can try first.

09:52.090 --> 09:55.094
I'm gonna use work words now,
so listen up, skank.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.295
I'm listening.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.746
I read
in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>

09:57.747 --> 10:00.153
that there's a whole black market
for cronuts on Craigslist.

10:00.154 --> 10:02.367
Craigslist? Oh, no.

10:02.368 --> 10:06.571
I don't want one bad enough to let some
guy lick my armpit for an hour again.

10:06.727 --> 10:07.995
They're not for us.

10:08.005 --> 10:10.587
We'll sell them at our window,
just to attract attention,

10:10.588 --> 10:13.664
and then, when they sell out,
we'll effortlessly switch to cupcakes.

10:13.665 --> 10:15.531
Classic bake and switch.

10:15.532 --> 10:18.794
All that work
for some stupid fad?

10:20.239 --> 10:22.532
I said "fad."

10:23.841 --> 10:27.371
We loved
"Behind the Candelabra".

10:31.937 --> 10:34.496
Try texting him again.
He's 15 minutes late.

10:34.498 --> 10:36.831
You're really surprised
that a guy reselling pastries

10:36.833 --> 10:39.904
in the "Rants and Raves" section
of Craigslist isn't the punctual type?

10:39.907 --> 10:41.138
[knocking on window]

10:41.240 --> 10:42.877
This is so exciting.

10:42.878 --> 10:45.356
I've never bought anything
on the black market before.

10:45.357 --> 10:49.413
I'm still afraid to go to that
Filipino market around the corner.

10:54.110 --> 10:55.401
Are you the guy?

10:55.403 --> 10:58.206
I don't know.
Are you the girl?

10:58.208 --> 11:01.524
So far,
this musical sucks.

11:01.846 --> 11:05.116
- What's the password?
- Cronut.

11:05.118 --> 11:08.131
Was "1234"
already taken?

11:11.383 --> 11:13.283
Meet us by the door.

11:13.285 --> 11:16.517
Which is code for,
"Meet us by the door."

11:16.519 --> 11:20.513
Which is code for,
"You're really bad at code."

11:20.815 --> 11:24.510
Okay, let's talk about our plan.
It's a classic good cop/bad cop.

11:24.512 --> 11:27.746
I'm gonna ask the guy for ten cronuts,
and he's gonna quote me 250.

11:27.747 --> 11:30.218
Right, then I play bad cop
and act outraged.

11:30.219 --> 11:32.561
And then I play good cop,
and we settle at 200.

11:32.562 --> 11:35.922
Yeah, and don't worry about me.
I'll improve some good stuff on the spot.

11:35.924 --> 11:37.806
Are you sure you don't
want to run it by me first?

11:37.822 --> 11:39.495
I was in an improve group
at Wharton.

11:39.497 --> 11:42.100
We were called
"The fun percent."

11:42.102 --> 11:46.607
And I can imagine myself not laughing
with 99% of the audience.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.249
Let's make it quick.

11:51.250 --> 11:54.577
You're not the only girls
in town who want my nuts!

11:55.323 --> 11:57.258
I assume you mean cronuts.

11:57.260 --> 12:00.213
No, I'm also
a male prostitute.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.868
Let's see the product.

12:11.146 --> 12:14.273
She meant
the other baked goods.

12:15.498 --> 12:18.199
You got to be clear.

12:19.831 --> 12:22.969
Pretty maids,
all in a row.

12:22.970 --> 12:25.409
Let mama get a taste.

12:26.070 --> 12:28.238
That's pure.
How much for ten?

12:28.319 --> 12:30.687
I know I said 250 earlier,
but...

12:30.688 --> 12:33.809
Bullcrap!
150 or we walk, bitch!

12:33.811 --> 12:38.400
Okay, let's all just calm down.
It's a really good deal, Max.

12:38.401 --> 12:40.550
How about we settle at 200
and call it a night?

12:40.551 --> 12:42.481
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
About that.

12:42.482 --> 12:45.151
I be getting mad offers
for these things tonight.

12:45.185 --> 12:49.541
I actually got to raise it
to 300, or I walk.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.078
Bitch.

12:51.401 --> 12:54.502
Ooh, ow, ow,
ooh, your hands are cold.

12:55.007 --> 12:56.543
What'd you call me?

12:56.545 --> 12:59.079
- Nothing.
- That's what I thought.

12:59.080 --> 13:02.827
She said 200. We'll pay 200.
And you'll take it.

13:02.828 --> 13:06.823
You'll shove it in this <i>hanes
her way</i> hoodie you're wearing,

13:06.824 --> 13:11.389
you'll say, "Thank you, Max"
and you'll hit the bricks, capisce?

13:11.390 --> 13:12.890
Caroline, cash.

13:16.607 --> 13:18.206
- Thank you, Max.
- What'd you say?

13:18.208 --> 13:19.938
Thank you, Max!

13:20.251 --> 13:23.320
I've got the chills now.
Do you guys serve tea?

13:26.538 --> 13:28.118
How's that for bad cop?

13:28.120 --> 13:32.594
Riveting. I felt like I was watching
<i>SVU: Bakery edition.</i>

13:38.533 --> 13:41.600
Okay, here we go.
This is the last one.

13:41.602 --> 13:43.194
You want this cronut?

13:43.195 --> 13:45.645
Lift up your shirt
and let me see 'em.

13:47.346 --> 13:50.688
Go get Han. I want to show him
what an ab is.

13:51.552 --> 13:54.785
Max, you should see the line.
It's halfway down the block.

13:54.786 --> 13:58.179
- We have a line. It's working.
- But what's gonna happen now?

13:58.180 --> 14:00.915
I worked at Target the Christmas,
they ran out of Tickle me Elmo,

14:00.917 --> 14:03.918
and... there was so much blood.

14:04.079 --> 14:07.750
As planned, we'll just calmly
switch to our delicious cupcakes,

14:07.751 --> 14:09.960
and then those'll sell out too
because they're that good.

14:09.961 --> 14:11.370
Okay.

14:11.727 --> 14:14.398
Attention, everyone.
Everyone, can I have your attention?

14:14.400 --> 14:18.501
Actually, we are very sorry, but
we are now sold out of cronuts.

14:18.503 --> 14:19.902
[all groaning]

14:19.904 --> 14:22.430
We do, however,
have something even better...

14:22.431 --> 14:24.046
Max's homemade cupcakes.

14:24.093 --> 14:26.393
[all yelling]

14:26.394 --> 14:28.044
All right, go!

14:28.045 --> 14:30.612
Leave.
Chase your stupid trends.

14:30.614 --> 14:32.381
But we're not worried!
Cupcakes are classic!

14:32.383 --> 14:33.583
We're Audrey Hepburn!

14:33.585 --> 14:35.435
Max, cupcakes are over.

14:35.564 --> 14:38.408
And you know why? Because
cupcakes are just one thing.

14:38.409 --> 14:40.724
If we had two things,
then we'd be something.

14:40.725 --> 14:42.290
That does it.
I'm calling the dealer.

14:42.292 --> 14:43.846
I don't think
we should order more cronuts.

14:43.847 --> 14:47.080
Oh, no, I mean my drug dealer.
I need to take the edge off.

14:47.081 --> 14:51.617
This sucks. I feel worse about myself
than I did when I dropped the torso man.

14:52.894 --> 14:56.736
- What are you doing with those fries?
- I'm dipping 'em in frosting.

14:56.738 --> 14:58.272
I do it when I'm depressed.

14:58.274 --> 15:01.474
I went right from baby food
into fries in frosting.

15:01.476 --> 15:03.377
Is it good?
It looks disgusting.

15:03.379 --> 15:06.445
It is both.
Just taste it.

15:07.468 --> 15:09.349
These are pretty good.

15:09.351 --> 15:12.827
Sweet and salty.
Cupcakes and fries.

15:13.310 --> 15:15.476
That's two things.

15:15.893 --> 15:18.827
Cake fries.
We're millionaires.

15:18.829 --> 15:23.943
My willingness to eat anything
finally pays off!

15:24.249 --> 15:26.934
Wait, are you sure it's not
just us being desperate?

15:26.935 --> 15:29.336
Like, when Adam Levine made
that music video in Brooklyn

15:29.338 --> 15:32.107
and you walked past the set
all day in a wet tank top?

15:32.109 --> 15:34.011
It can't hurt to put them
out there.

15:34.013 --> 15:36.615
That's what you said
that day too.

15:40.524 --> 15:43.951
- Just sit down for a second, Han.
- But this is the middle of a shift.

15:43.952 --> 15:46.780
I'm gonna tell everyone you're
in the middle of a male-to-female shift

15:46.782 --> 15:48.649
if you don't sit down.

15:48.651 --> 15:49.853
All right.

15:49.854 --> 15:52.156
You are here tonight
to taste the next big thing.

15:52.213 --> 15:56.088
Okay, now you're just repeating
my pick-up lines back to me.

15:56.333 --> 16:00.903
No, it's a new dessert, and we've
assembled the perfect focus group...

16:00.905 --> 16:03.740
A black man, a pig,
and a health fanatic.

16:03.742 --> 16:05.309
Y'all know who you are.

16:05.311 --> 16:08.975
I suppose I have been
trying to eat better lately.

16:08.977 --> 16:12.004
Hey, extra, extra!
Read all about it!

16:12.005 --> 16:14.944
I'm bisexual now!

16:16.952 --> 16:21.426
Oh, perfect, now we have
the LGBTQ community represented.

16:21.428 --> 16:23.862
- What's the "Q"?
- Questioning.

16:23.864 --> 16:26.458
And answered.

16:26.552 --> 16:29.621
Hey, everybody.
Meet Veronica.

16:29.622 --> 16:33.423
She's cute, she's black, she has
short blonde hair, she's exciting.

16:33.424 --> 16:37.633
- And we met in Soul Cycle class.
- Yes, we did.

16:37.634 --> 16:40.770
I slipped in her sweat
and she bought me a Luna bar.

16:41.018 --> 16:45.148
Now?
Now you're bisexual?

16:47.033 --> 16:50.497
Well, yeah, you got
to keep up with the trends.

16:51.368 --> 16:54.474
Okay, focus group.
Let's focus.

16:54.475 --> 16:57.225
This is our new product,
called Cake Fries.

16:57.226 --> 16:58.428
Cute, right?

16:58.429 --> 17:00.176
You just take a fry
from the left side,

17:00.177 --> 17:02.077
dip it into the cupcake frosting
on the right,

17:02.078 --> 17:04.646
and enjoy your sweet,
yet savory dessert.

17:04.785 --> 17:08.938
Is this woman seriously trying
to teach me how to eat food?

17:09.261 --> 17:12.630
Oh, no, this looks very fattening,
and I've been on a fast.

17:12.632 --> 17:16.877
- One lick isn't going to kill you.
- Yeah, just ask Sophie.

17:18.096 --> 17:19.932
Okay, one bite.

17:20.646 --> 17:22.983
Now I don't want any of you
to hold back.

17:22.984 --> 17:25.085
Be completely honest
in your criticism.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.145
- Well, I feel like...
- Shut up, Han.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.349
No, I was gonna say
this is very good.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.317
Too good.

17:33.224 --> 17:36.758
Uh-oh, look away, girls.
You've released the Kraken.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.513
Damn.
That <i>is</i> tasty.

17:40.514 --> 17:43.722
Now you may have
given me diabetes,

17:43.871 --> 17:46.711
as I have just lost the feeling
in my left foot.

17:46.818 --> 17:51.386
You know what, I think
I might be trisexual,

17:51.387 --> 17:54.590
because I'm having a love affair
with these cake fries.

17:54.591 --> 17:56.995
Oh, my gosh,
this is gross.

17:56.996 --> 17:58.869
And it's very messy.

17:58.870 --> 18:02.156
Oh, come on,
then what was earlier?

18:02.507 --> 18:04.775
Okay, everyone,
this is all very helpful.

18:04.777 --> 18:06.446
We're still
working some things out.

18:06.982 --> 18:10.352
Uh-oh.
My tummy feels funny.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.993
You mean your ab is hurting?

18:14.192 --> 18:16.894
Han, your first food in a week
probably shouldn't have been

18:16.896 --> 18:19.465
a fistful of fries
and frosting.

18:19.467 --> 18:21.968
You know what, guys?
We've all worked hard today.

18:21.970 --> 18:24.848
- Let's call it a night.
- But it's only 9:00.

18:24.849 --> 18:26.149
Pardon me. Excuse me.

18:26.213 --> 18:28.797
Uh-oh. You don't want
to see that...

18:28.822 --> 18:30.322
Look out!

18:30.323 --> 18:32.607
Move it.
Move it or lose it.

18:32.621 --> 18:34.791
Move it or I lose it.

18:34.793 --> 18:37.351
Out of way, out of my way now!

18:41.959 --> 18:44.322
Oh, dear...

18:45.190 --> 18:47.608
This is more embarrassing
than when Han fell asleep

18:47.609 --> 18:50.981
and Oleg drew a penis
on his face.

18:51.223 --> 18:55.657
I traced that penis
on his face.

18:58.752 --> 19:02.524
Now you dip the fries in the frosting,
but I find the best way to eat this

19:02.525 --> 19:05.094
is to first make sure
you feel super empty inside.

19:05.095 --> 19:07.685
Not gonna be a problem.

19:08.079 --> 19:10.214
These are adorable.

19:10.216 --> 19:12.353
Could you please
take a picture of me with it?

19:12.355 --> 19:14.187
It's so cute.

19:17.874 --> 19:20.059
And make sure
you hashtag that picture

19:20.061 --> 19:23.797
"Max's homemade cake fries"
when you post it online.

19:26.001 --> 19:29.266
A sad girl smiling
with our cake fries.

19:29.267 --> 19:33.121
Once that hits iVillage, we'll be
knee-deep in canvas totes and cankles.

19:33.122 --> 19:35.454
[Caroline laughing]
Here you go!

19:35.455 --> 19:38.274
Sorry, that was our last cake fries.
We'll have more tomorrow.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.383
- Wait. We sold out?
- We sold out!

19:41.385 --> 19:43.324
Oh, my god!
We sold out!

19:43.325 --> 19:46.691
Yes! I'm a sell-out!
Let's buy a helicopter!

19:46.692 --> 19:48.445
Hi, girls.

19:48.679 --> 19:52.344
Oh, hey, Sophie. We're sorry,
but we just ran out of cake fries.

19:52.345 --> 19:55.720
Oh, that's fine by me.
I'm going back to the basics.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.928
Cupcakes and penis.

19:59.336 --> 20:03.205
Here's your cupcake.
We don't sell the other basic.

20:04.549 --> 20:05.952
Mm...

20:06.063 --> 20:07.795
You know,
it's nice to eat something

20:07.796 --> 20:11.035
you don't have to compliment
every five minutes.

20:15.819 --> 20:17.419
You know what, Max?

20:17.420 --> 20:20.221
Cupcakes, cronuts,
cake fries, whatever.

20:20.254 --> 20:24.353
We're gonna be successful because we have
the two things that really matter...

20:24.354 --> 20:25.991
You and me.

20:25.993 --> 20:30.060
We're kinda like cake fries.
I mean, salty and sweet.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.294
- I'm sweet...
- And I've been assaulted.
