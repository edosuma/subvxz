WEBVTT

00:02.735 --> 00:04.235
THIS IS AMY.

00:04.270 --> 00:07.039
I AM COMPLETELY ALONE RIGHT NOW.

00:08.374 --> 00:09.408
ADAM.

00:09.443 --> 00:10.408
WHAT?

00:10.443 --> 00:12.543
SOMETHING JUST WHISPERED
IN MY EAR DOWN HERE.

00:12.578 --> 00:16.015
SHE SAW TWO SCRATCHES
GO LIKE THIS ACROSS MY FACE.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.784
IT'S TRYING
TO MESS WITH US.

00:21.053 --> 00:21.986
WHAT IS THAT?

00:22.021 --> 00:23.689
SHOWING ME
THROWING A BODY IN.

00:25.091 --> 00:28.728
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE SHOEBOX MURDER?

00:33.199 --> 00:34.966
I'M AMY BRUNI.

00:35.001 --> 00:37.402
AND I'M ADAM BERRY.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.504
WE'VE SPENT
A COMBINED 30 YEARS

00:39.505 --> 00:43.109
INVESTIGATING THE WORLD'S
MOST TERRIFYING HAUNTINGS.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.742
AFTER THOUSANDS OF CASES,

00:44.777 --> 00:48.014
WE ARE READY FOR OUR
MOST IMPORTANT JOURNEY YET.

00:49.949 --> 00:54.086
RESCUING FAMILIES TERRORIZED
BY PARANORMAL ACTIVITY

00:54.121 --> 00:56.989
IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.776
WE UNCOVER THE TRUTH
BEHIND THE HAUNTING

00:59.811 --> 01:02.562
TO HELP FAMILIES
RECLAIM THEIR HOMES...

01:02.597 --> 01:04.147
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:04.182 --> 01:05.698
...AND THEIR LIVES.

01:11.737 --> 01:13.771
I WANT TO TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT THIS CASE.

01:13.806 --> 01:16.476
YEAH, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU
DIDN'T BRING ME HERE TO EAT.

01:16.511 --> 01:19.646
SO, OUR HOMEOWNERS
ARE JEANNINE AND CHRIS.

01:19.681 --> 01:20.912
LOTS OF ACTIVITY,

01:20.947 --> 01:23.449
BUT THERE'S ALSO
A BIT OF VIOLENT ACTIVITY.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.582
WOW.

01:24.617 --> 01:26.585
THINGS LIKE THIS
HAVE BEEN HAPPENING.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.405
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE
CENTERED AROUND CHRIS.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.599
HE'S GOTTEN SCRATCHED
ON THIS OCCASION,

01:31.634 --> 01:33.759
THEN HE'S ALSO BEEN SCRATCHED
ON THE FACE.

01:33.794 --> 01:37.363
THAT'S JUST ONE INCIDENT
OF MANY.

01:37.398 --> 01:38.729
- THAT'S A BIG DEAL.
- YEAH.

01:38.764 --> 01:40.765
THEY HAVE THINGS
MOVE ON THEIR OWN.

01:40.766 --> 01:43.435
THEY HAVE SEEN A SHADOW FIGURE
IN THE HOUSE.

01:43.470 --> 01:44.737
- THAT'S WILD.
- I KNOW.

01:44.772 --> 01:45.970
DOES IT HAPPEN
ALL THE TIME?

01:46.005 --> 01:48.307
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME --
ALMOST DAILY.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.808
AND WHAT DO THEY
THINK IT IS?

01:49.843 --> 01:53.344
SHE FEELS AS THOUGH
IT MIGHT BE HER MOM.

01:53.379 --> 01:56.113
I WOULD HOPE IT'S NOT,
BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD.

01:56.148 --> 02:00.186
I MEAN, THE FAMILY WOULDN'T BE
DOING THE AGGRESSIVE ACTIVITY.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.519
AND IF IT'S NOT FAMILY,

02:01.554 --> 02:04.223
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHY THEY'RE THERE,

02:04.258 --> 02:05.423
WHO THEY ARE.

02:05.424 --> 02:07.758
THIS CASE SEEMS TO BE
A LITTLE MORE... AGGRESSIVE.

02:07.793 --> 02:09.961
...THAN ANY OF THE OTHER ONES.

02:09.997 --> 02:12.382
YEAH.

02:19.338 --> 02:21.272
SO, I MEAN, BASICALLY,
HOW WE START

02:21.307 --> 02:23.759
IS WE'RE JUST GONNA GET
KIND OF A GENERAL IDEA

02:23.794 --> 02:26.212
OF YOUR HOUSE AND WHERE
YOU'VE HAD ACTIVITY.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.579
BEFORE THAT, EVEN,

02:27.580 --> 02:30.083
CAN YOU JUST KIND OF GIVE US
A LITTLE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE

02:30.118 --> 02:31.417
AND HOW YOU
ENDED UP HERE?

02:31.452 --> 02:32.450
SURE.

02:32.485 --> 02:36.122
FEBRUARY OF 1995,
I PURCHASED THE HOME,

02:36.157 --> 02:37.422
AND I MOVED IN HERE.

02:37.457 --> 02:39.692
THE HOUSE IS COMPLETELY
DONE DIFFERENTLY

02:39.727 --> 02:41.192
THAN WHAT
IT WAS ORIGINALLY.

02:41.227 --> 02:42.660
JUST ABOUT EVERY ROOM
IN THIS HOUSE,

02:42.695 --> 02:44.829
IN SOME WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM
HAS BEEN DONE OVER.

02:44.830 --> 02:46.314
HAVE YOU ALWAYS HAD
ACTIVITY HAPPENING,

02:46.349 --> 02:47.799
EVER SINCE YOU MOVED
INTO THE HOUSE?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.369
- YES.
- INTERESTING.

02:51.637 --> 02:54.807
WE HAD JUST TAKEN DOWN
THAT WALL RIGHT BEHIND CHRIS

02:54.842 --> 02:56.375
TO OPEN THAT UP
TO GO DOWN TO THE BASEMENT.

02:57.443 --> 03:00.029
AND I HEAR "JEANNINE"
IN A MAN'S VOICE.

03:00.064 --> 03:02.974
SO I TURNED AROUND,
THINKING IT WAS CHRIS,

03:03.009 --> 03:05.885
AND I SAID, "WHAT?
CHRIS, WHAT DO YOU NEED?"

03:05.920 --> 03:07.851
AND I DIDN'T...

03:07.886 --> 03:09.187
HE DIDN'T ANSWER BACK.

03:09.222 --> 03:12.022
AS I TURN AROUND,
A SHADOW -- BLACK SHADOW --

03:12.057 --> 03:15.361
PROBABLY AROUND YOUR HEIGHT,
MAYBE A LITTLE TALLER,

03:15.396 --> 03:17.863
WALKED ACROSS THAT WALL
THROUGH THE DOOR

03:17.898 --> 03:21.565
AND THEN DOWN THE STAIRS.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.602
BUT IT WASN'T
UP AGAINST THE WALL,

03:23.637 --> 03:25.805
LIKE A NORMAL SHADOW WOULD BE.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.939
IT WAS AWAY FROM THE WALL.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.341
OKAY, SO THIS
SOLID WALL WAS HERE.

03:29.342 --> 03:31.009
AND THIS --
DID THIS HAVE A DOOR OR NO?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.077
- NO.
- NO.

03:32.078 --> 03:33.445
IT'S NEVER HAD A DOOR?

03:33.480 --> 03:33.979
WELL, IT DID.

03:34.014 --> 03:34.513
MANY YEARS AGO.

03:34.514 --> 03:35.813
WHEN I FIRST MOVED IN HERE,
IT DID.

03:35.848 --> 03:37.483
OKAY, SO THE WHOLE TIME
ALL THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON,

03:37.518 --> 03:38.650
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
DOING RENOVATIONS?

03:39.685 --> 03:41.286
IT SEEMS LIKE
MORE I DO TO THE HOUSE,

03:41.321 --> 03:43.522
THE MORE WE SEE THINGS
AND WE HEAR THINGS.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.123
I TOOK ALL THIS OUT.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.858
AND JEANNINE
WAS STANDING HERE,

03:46.893 --> 03:50.329
AND SHE SAID SHE SAW
TWO SCRATCHES GO LIKE
THIS ACROSS MY FACE.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.662
REALLY?

03:51.697 --> 03:54.100
AND SHE'S LIKE, "YOU JUST GOT
TWO SCRATCHES ON YOUR FACE."

03:54.135 --> 03:55.667
I'M LIKE, "YEAH, OKAY."

03:55.702 --> 03:57.202
SHE'S LIKE,
"GO IN THE MIRROR AND LOOK."

03:57.237 --> 03:58.703
I WENT IN THE MIRROR,
I'M LOOKING LIKE THIS,

03:58.704 --> 04:01.073
AND NOW I SEE THE THIRD ONE
COME JUST LIKE THAT.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.340
ALL RIGHT.
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY, LIKE...

04:02.375 --> 04:06.210
- YOU NEVER HAD ANY DERMATITIS OR
SKIN ALLERGIES OR ANYTHING EVER? - NO, NO.

04:06.245 --> 04:07.444
AND I'M NOT A BELIEVER.

04:07.479 --> 04:08.815
I'D JUST BE LIKE,
"THAT'S WEIRD."

04:08.850 --> 04:09.880
YEAH.

04:09.915 --> 04:12.651
BUT THEN, WHEN I SAW
THIS THING DOWNSTAIRS,

04:12.686 --> 04:15.387
I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING HERE.

04:18.957 --> 04:21.326
I WAS COMING IN HERE,
AND WE HAD THE CURTAIN.

04:21.361 --> 04:23.646
AND THE CURTAIN WAS OPEN
A LITTLE BIT.

04:23.681 --> 04:26.023
SO, AS I WAS WALKING
INTO THIS ROOM HERE,

04:26.058 --> 04:28.366
I FELT LIKE
SOMEBODY WAS STARING AT ME,

04:28.367 --> 04:29.733
AND I TURNED TO LOOK.

04:29.768 --> 04:33.138
CLEAR AS DAY, I SAW THE SHAPE
OF A MAN ALL IN BLACK.

04:33.139 --> 04:35.273
WHEN I SAW THE FIGURE
STANDING THERE,

04:35.308 --> 04:37.376
I JUST TURNED AROUND
AND WENT RIGHT UPSTAIRS.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.445
AND JEANNINE SAW ME THERE,
AND SHE'S LIKE,

04:39.480 --> 04:40.712
"YOU LOOK
WHITE AS A GHOST."

04:40.713 --> 04:44.383
AND I WAS LIKE,
"I JUST SAW A SHADOW OF A FIGURE

04:44.418 --> 04:45.618
STANDING IN OUR DOORWAY."

04:45.653 --> 04:47.618
WEIRD.

04:47.653 --> 04:49.555
THAT'S ONE THING
YOU'LL FEEL A LOT DOWN HERE,

04:49.590 --> 04:50.823
IS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
WATCHING YOU.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.058
TWO SONS GOT THIS ROOM.

04:54.093 --> 04:57.127
THEY USED TO SLEEP
WITH THEIR EARPHONES IN,

04:57.162 --> 04:59.196
THEIR BLANKETS OVER THEIR HEAD,
AND THE LIGHTS ON

04:59.231 --> 05:02.935
BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE ARGUING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.337
- REALLY?
- THEY WOULD HEAR IT?

05:04.372 --> 05:05.704
- THEY WOULD HEAR IT.
- IN THIS ROOM?

05:05.739 --> 05:07.305
PHYSICALLY HEAR IT
IN THIS ROOM.

05:07.340 --> 05:11.342
SO, WHO DO YOU THINK IS CAUSING
THE ACTIVITY IN THE HOUSE?

05:11.343 --> 05:13.546
I THINK IT'S MY MOTHER.

05:13.581 --> 05:14.745
OKAY.

05:14.780 --> 05:16.114
SHE DIDN'T LIKE ME.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.348
WHY?

05:17.383 --> 05:19.784
THEY GOT ALONG THE FIRST FEW
YEARS THAT WE WERE TOGETHER,

05:19.785 --> 05:22.321
AND THEN AFTERWARDS,
MY MOTHER GOT SICK WITH CANCER.

05:23.455 --> 05:24.757
AND I THINK A LOT OF IT
AFFECTED HER BRAIN.

05:24.792 --> 05:25.890
- OKAY.
- SURE, OKAY.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.627
EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T
BRAIN CANCER, BUT I THINK...

05:28.662 --> 05:30.329
THE CHEMO, THE TREATMENT --

05:30.364 --> 05:30.946
CHANGES EVERYTHING.

05:30.981 --> 05:31.564
- YEP.
- YEAH, YEAH.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.202
ADAM.

05:36.237 --> 05:37.235
WHAT?

05:37.270 --> 05:40.873
SOMETHING JUST WHISPERED
IN MY EAR DOWN HERE.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.692
I'M SORRY, WHAT?

05:42.727 --> 05:44.319
I'M ALL BY MYSELF.

05:44.354 --> 05:45.876
WAIT, WHAT HAPPENED?

05:45.911 --> 05:48.881
I JUST HEARD SOMETHING
JUST WHISPER RIGHT IN MY EAR.

05:48.916 --> 05:49.881
WHAT DID IT SAY?

05:49.882 --> 05:51.849
IT WAS JUST...

05:51.884 --> 05:53.918
I COULDN'T MAKE OUT
WHAT IT WAS SAYING.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.953
IT WAS -- IT JUST
SOUNDED LIKE

05:55.954 --> 05:57.488
- THAT'S WEIRD.
- I KNOW.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.191
THAT'S THE SAME THING
THAT THEY TALK ABOUT ALL
THE TIME, THOUGH, RIGHT?

05:59.226 --> 06:02.494
YEAH.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.229
IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET OUR ATTENTION,

06:04.264 --> 06:06.065
CAN YOU DO THAT AGAIN
FOR US?

06:11.137 --> 06:13.005
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

06:19.412 --> 06:21.847
DID YOU JUST WHISPER
IN MY EAR?

06:27.886 --> 06:29.956
CAN YOU DO IT AGAIN?

06:32.524 --> 06:35.828
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S PLAY
THIS BACK AND SEE IF...

06:37.000 --> 06:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:44.237 --> 06:45.204
IT'S QUIET.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.403
YEAH.

06:46.438 --> 06:48.508
MAYBE IT ONLY WANTS
TO TALK TO ME.

06:48.543 --> 06:49.709
LEAVE.

06:51.777 --> 06:53.546
DON'T HAVE TELL ME TWICE.

06:56.114 --> 06:57.515
ALL RIGHT.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.884
WHOEVER IS DOWN HERE WITH ME --

06:58.919 --> 06:59.983
WAIT,
IS THERE SOMEBODY --

07:00.018 --> 07:01.921
IS THERE SOMEBODY
IN THE KITCHEN?

07:01.956 --> 07:02.853
WAIT.

07:02.888 --> 07:04.721
WHAT,
ARE YOU HEARING THAT NOISE?

07:04.756 --> 07:06.191
DID YOU NEAR THE KNOCK
THAT CAME UP HERE?

07:06.226 --> 07:07.525
YEAH, YES.
WHAT WAS THAT?

07:07.526 --> 07:09.762
I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS FROM,
LIKE, THE BACK BEDROOM.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.061
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

07:11.096 --> 07:13.199
IT WAS, LIKE, LITERALLY FROM
THE BACK AREA OF THE HOUSE.

07:13.234 --> 07:14.598
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

07:14.633 --> 07:17.635
WAIT, IS THAT IT AGAIN?

07:17.636 --> 07:19.071
I HEARD IT.
IT WAS LIKE A THUD.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.471
YEAH.
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING.

07:20.506 --> 07:21.607
WHY DON'T YOU
GO INVESTIGATE THAT.

07:21.642 --> 07:22.809
I'LL STAY RIGHT HERE.

07:22.844 --> 07:22.844
ALL RIGHT.

07:27.146 --> 07:31.417
ALL RIGHT, WHOEVER'S HERE,
WE THINK WE HEAR YOU.

07:39.892 --> 07:40.992
THERE'S, LIKE, SOMETHING

07:41.027 --> 07:43.229
REALLY TRYING TO GET
OUR ATTENTION RIGHT NOW.

07:43.264 --> 07:44.996
WHO ARE YOU?

07:47.266 --> 07:48.801
KNOCK AGAIN FOR ME.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.972
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

07:55.173 --> 07:57.509
CAN YOU SAY YOUR NAME,
PLEASE, INTO THIS

07:57.544 --> 07:58.978
BEFORE I PLAY IT BACK?

08:13.127 --> 08:14.126
NOTHING.

08:17.329 --> 08:18.865
THAT WAS ADAM.

08:21.700 --> 08:22.833
NOTHING.

08:22.868 --> 08:25.020
NOTHING
ON THAT RECORDER.

08:25.055 --> 08:27.173
SO IT'S JUST
TOTALLY QUIET.

08:27.208 --> 08:28.873
THIS IS AMY.

08:28.908 --> 08:32.775
I AM COMPLETELY ALONE
RIGHT NOW.

08:32.811 --> 08:37.149
SO, BASICALLY, AMY IS DOWNSTAIRS
IN THE BASEMENT BY HERSELF.

08:37.183 --> 08:43.255
I CAN SEE HER FROM ONE, TWO,
THREE DIFFERENT ANGLES.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.389
SO, I'M GONNA MONITOR HER

08:45.424 --> 08:48.227
TO SEE IF I SEE
ANY MOVEMENT AROUND HER.

08:54.099 --> 08:56.335
HOW MANY OF YOU ARE HERE?

09:03.242 --> 09:05.978
DO YOU KNOW WHO JEANNINE IS?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.156
WHAT?

09:26.899 --> 09:31.304
SO, BASICALLY, AMY IS DOWNSTAIRS
IN THE BASEMENT BY HERSELF.

09:31.339 --> 09:33.605
I CAN SEE HER
FROM THREE DIFFERENT ANG--

09:38.178 --> 09:39.142
WHAT?

09:39.177 --> 09:41.080
I got something
on the recorder.

09:46.017 --> 09:48.254
LISTEN TO THIS.

09:54.159 --> 09:55.394
"YOU'RE NOT ALONE."

09:55.429 --> 09:56.293
GOD.

09:56.328 --> 09:57.596
"YOU'RE NOT ALONE."

10:08.907 --> 10:10.540
I THINK WHATEVER IS HERE

10:10.575 --> 10:13.511
IS PROBABLY ATTACHED
TO THIS HOUSE IN SOME WAY.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.448
I WONDER IF IT WOULD DO IT
IF <i> I</i> WAS ALONE.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.584
- DO YOU WANT TO TRY IT?
- YEAH.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.687
YOU CAN TRY ALL YOU WANT
TO SCARE US,

10:21.722 --> 10:24.523
BUT WE'RE NOT EASILY SCARED.

10:27.859 --> 10:30.828
ARE YOU MOVING UPSTAIRS?

10:30.863 --> 10:35.568
No, but I was just hearing
a little tapping sound.

10:40.105 --> 10:43.242
I'M GETTING UP RIGHT NOW.
HOLD ON.

10:43.277 --> 10:45.276
Copy.

10:55.020 --> 10:57.756
Sounded like someone
was walking around on the porch,

10:57.791 --> 11:01.759
but there's no one
out here.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.829
YEAH, IF I HAD TO PINPOINT
THE SOUND,

11:03.864 --> 11:07.132
IT WAS ABOVE ME
TO MY LEFT.

11:09.568 --> 11:11.368
I'm gonna play it back now.

11:11.403 --> 11:14.271
<i> WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF YOU.</i>

11:14.306 --> 11:17.442
<i> YOU CAN TRY ALL YOU WANT.</i>

11:17.477 --> 11:20.579
<i> WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF YOU.</i>

11:21.746 --> 11:25.516
ARE YOU OKAY?

11:25.517 --> 11:27.720
Yeah,
you should come down here.

11:32.591 --> 11:33.824
JUST LISTEN.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.595
<i> I'M ALL ALONE IN THE BASEMENT.</i>

11:36.630 --> 11:40.199
<i> WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF YOU.</i>

11:41.400 --> 11:42.668
<i> YOU CAN TRY ALL YOU WANT
TO SCARE US...</i>

11:42.703 --> 11:44.554
WHAT WAS THAT?

11:46.405 --> 11:48.039
- <i> ARE YOU MOVING UPSTAIRS?</i>
- WHAT?

11:48.074 --> 11:49.440
I DON'T KNOW.
"WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF YOU,"

11:49.441 --> 11:51.409
AND THEN IT GOES, "KSSHT!"
- YEAH.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.377
"WE'RE NOT EVEN SCARED" --
KA-KA!

11:53.378 --> 11:56.315
WHATEVER IS HERE
LIKES TO TRY TO SCARE YOU.

11:56.350 --> 11:57.714
IT'S TRYING TO GET
OUR ATTENTION,

11:57.749 --> 12:01.086
BUT IT'S ALSO KIND OF ENJOYING
BEING THE PUPPETEER.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.355
IT LIKES CONTROLLING
THE SITUATION.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.590
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S JEANNINE'S MOTHER

12:05.625 --> 12:06.890
OR IF IT'S SOMEONE ELSE,

12:06.925 --> 12:08.493
BUT BEFORE WE WRAP
FOR THE NIGHT,

12:08.494 --> 12:10.462
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THIS GHOST KNOWS

12:10.497 --> 12:12.395
THAT WE ARE IN CHARGE,
NOT THEM.

12:12.430 --> 12:14.766
SO, WHOEVER'S HERE,
IF YOU SEPARATE US,

12:14.801 --> 12:16.100
IT DOESN'T AFFECT US.

12:16.135 --> 12:19.037
IT DOESN'T MAKE US ANY MORE
FRIGHTENED OR VULNERABLE,

12:19.072 --> 12:21.724
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR TOO LONG.

12:21.759 --> 12:24.376
AND SO, WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

12:24.411 --> 12:27.044
WE ARE NOT AFRAID.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.279
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO SCARE US.

12:29.314 --> 12:33.035
BUT, IF YOU LIKE A CHALLENGE,
WE'RE UP FOR IT.

12:33.070 --> 12:36.756
ALL RIGHT, COOL.
LET'S PACK IT UP FOR NOW.

12:38.990 --> 12:42.227
I'M GOING TO START THE DAY
TALKING TO JEANNINE

12:42.262 --> 12:43.528
TO FIND OUT
IF SHE KNOWS ANYTHING

12:43.563 --> 12:45.080
ABOUT THE HOUSE'S HISTORY.

12:45.115 --> 12:46.563
I ALSO WANT TO DIG DEEPER

12:46.598 --> 12:49.101
ABOUT WHY SHE THINKS
HER MOM IS PRESENT.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.434
NOW, JUST -- JUST
TO GET STARTED,

12:51.469 --> 12:54.773
I KNOW THAT THINGS WEREN'T GREAT
WITH YOUR MOTHER AT THE END.

12:54.808 --> 12:58.243
BUT, OTHER THAN THAT,
WHAT WAS HER PERSONALITY LIKE?

12:58.278 --> 13:01.511
SHE WAS ALWAYS WITH KIDS.

13:01.546 --> 13:03.747
I MEAN, EVEN AFTER
SHE RETIRED FROM THE DAY CARE,

13:03.782 --> 13:06.385
SHE BECAME A LUNCH LADY AT
ONE OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.

13:06.420 --> 13:08.118
SO, ANYTHING THAT I LEARNED

13:08.153 --> 13:10.522
ON HOW TO TAKE CARE OF MY KIDS
CAME FROM HER.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.190
OKAY.
ME AND HER WERE INSEPARABLE.

13:13.225 --> 13:14.523
I MEAN, WE HAD,
LIKE, A PERFECT...

13:14.558 --> 13:16.945
- I WAS JUST GONNA ASK THAT.
- ...MOTHER-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP.

13:16.980 --> 13:19.263
THE FIRST TIME
SHE GOT CANCER,

13:19.298 --> 13:20.964
- I STAYED EVERY NIGHT WITH HER
AT THE HOSPITAL. - RIGHT.

13:20.999 --> 13:21.965
I MEAN, WE REALLY HAD

13:22.000 --> 13:24.436
THAT TYPE OF A RELATIONSHIP
AT THE TIME.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.871
NOW, DID YOUR MOM
EVER LIVE HERE?

13:25.906 --> 13:26.903
FOR TWO YEARS.

13:26.938 --> 13:28.807
AND THEN THINGS
STARTED TO FALL APART,

13:28.842 --> 13:30.676
BECAUSE SHE ENDED UP
HAVING CANCER AGAIN.

13:32.110 --> 13:35.014
AFTER YOUR MOM MOVED OUT,
DID YOU GUYS SPEAK ANY MORE?

13:35.049 --> 13:37.983
THE WEEK BEFORE SHE DIED,
I GOT AHOLD OF HER.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.017
I SAID, "MOM, IT'S J.J."

13:40.018 --> 13:41.719
AND I COULD HEAR --
IN THE BACKGROUND,

13:41.754 --> 13:43.386
I CAN HEAR THE BEEPING
OF THE MACHINES.

13:43.421 --> 13:46.125
AND SHE GOES, "I REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW,"

13:46.160 --> 13:47.558
AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.

13:47.593 --> 13:49.361
AND THAT WAS THE LAST WORDS
I EVER HEARD MY MOTHER SAY.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.795
MY GOODNESS.

13:51.830 --> 13:55.000
AND ODDS ARE, SHE HAD NO IDEA
WHERE SHE WAS AT, MEDICALLY,

13:55.035 --> 13:56.034
WHEN SHE TALKED TO YOU.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.200
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

13:57.235 --> 14:00.871
IS THERE ANY SPECIFIC
ACTIVITY THAT HAPPENS

14:00.906 --> 14:03.242
THAT YOU WOULD ATTRIBUTE
TO YOUR MOTHER, POTENTIALLY?

14:03.277 --> 14:07.277
THIS IS A COLLIE
THAT MY MOTHER HAD.

14:07.312 --> 14:09.114
I REMEMBER PLAYING WITH IT
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.247
YEAH.

14:10.282 --> 14:12.183
IT DID FALL OFF THE TOP SHELF
ALL ON ITS OWN.

14:12.218 --> 14:13.550
- IT DID?
- YES.

14:13.585 --> 14:15.170
WE NEED TO DO
A LOT OF RESEARCH

14:15.205 --> 14:16.720
ON THE HISTORY
OF THE HOUSE.

14:16.755 --> 14:19.224
I'M GOING TO SEE
WHAT I CAN FIND OUT ONLINE

14:19.259 --> 14:21.443
WHILE ADAM GETS MORE INFO
FROM CHRIS.

14:21.478 --> 14:23.628
HE'S LIVED IN THIS TOWN
HIS ENTIRE LIFE,

14:23.663 --> 14:25.047
AND SHOULD GIVE US
SOME CLUES.

14:25.082 --> 14:26.624
CHRIS, THANK YOU, MAN,

14:26.659 --> 14:28.497
FOR TALKING WITH ME
FOR A MINUTE.

14:28.532 --> 14:30.335
I MEAN,
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU --

14:30.370 --> 14:31.602
YOU'RE EXTREMELY RATIONAL.

14:31.637 --> 14:32.736
LIKE, YOU'RE A MILITARY GUY.

14:32.771 --> 14:35.272
- LIKE, YOU DO NOT
JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. -

14:35.273 --> 14:36.307
I KNOW I'M NOT NUTS.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.307
YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH.

14:37.342 --> 14:39.011
AND I KNOW WHAT I SAW,
I KNOW WHAT I FELT,

14:39.046 --> 14:40.311
I KNOW WHAT I HEARD.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.080
WHY DO YOU THINK JEANNINE
THINKS IT'S HER MOM?

14:42.115 --> 14:45.315
SHE FEELS THAT
SHE DIDN'T GET TO,

14:45.350 --> 14:48.186
YOU KNOW, SAY GOOD-BYE
TO HER MOM THE RIGHT WAY,

14:48.221 --> 14:50.456
LIKE SHE SHOULD
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO.

14:50.491 --> 14:52.976
AND, I THINK,
MAYBE, SHE THINKS

14:53.011 --> 14:55.426
HER MOM'S TRYING TO,
YOU KNOW,

14:55.461 --> 14:57.462
MAYBE MAKE AMENDS
OR MAKE IT WORSE.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.562
I DON'T KNOW.

14:58.597 --> 14:59.965
DO YOU THINK
IT'S THE MOM?

15:01.800 --> 15:03.834
I -- ME, PERSONALLY?

15:03.835 --> 15:04.668
- YEAH.
- I DON'T.

15:04.703 --> 15:06.736
WHAT ABOUT
THE SCRATCHES?

15:06.771 --> 15:08.038
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
THE SCRATCHING --

15:08.073 --> 15:10.476
SHE WAS ALIVE WHEN
THOSE SCRATCHES HAPPENED.

15:12.177 --> 15:14.678
- THAT'S SO STRANGE.
- YEP.

15:14.713 --> 15:16.081
SO, THIS IS
STARTLING INFORMATION,

15:16.116 --> 15:17.715
BECAUSE,
AFTER TALKING WITH CHRIS,

15:17.750 --> 15:19.316
I REALIZE THE TIMELINE
DOESN'T MATCH UP,

15:19.351 --> 15:21.119
BECAUSE THERE WAS
VIOLENT PARANORMAL ACTIVITY

15:21.154 --> 15:23.220
WHILE JEANNINE'S MOM
WAS STILL ALIVE.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.025
SO THERE'S DEFINITELY NO WAY
THE MOM COULD BE RESPONSIBLE

15:26.060 --> 15:28.093
FOR EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON HERE.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.026
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA,

15:29.027 --> 15:31.128
LIKE, WHO YOU THINK
IT MIGHT BE?

15:31.163 --> 15:33.197
THE LADY ACROSS THE STREET,
WITH THE LIGHT THERE,

15:33.232 --> 15:36.067
SHE SAID THAT THE OLD MAN
AND OLD LADY THAT LIVED HERE,

15:36.102 --> 15:37.569
THE OLD MAN
WAS A NASTY GUY.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.702
YEAH.

15:38.737 --> 15:40.606
NOW, I WAS TOLD THAT
THE OLD MAN DIED IN HERE.

15:40.641 --> 15:41.973
- THAT'S CRAZY.
- YEP.

15:47.246 --> 15:49.681
- YOU GUYS GREW UP HERE, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

15:49.716 --> 15:52.117
- YOU'VE ALWAYS GROWN UP HERE?
- YEAH.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.954
WE TALKED TO YOUR MOM
EXTENSIVELY

15:54.989 --> 15:57.721
AND CHRIS FOR A WHILE,
AND, YOU KNOW,

15:57.756 --> 15:59.525
THEY'VE HAD ACTIVITY, BUT, LIKE,
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW

15:59.560 --> 16:00.992
WHAT KIND OF ACTIVITY
YOU GUYS HAVE EXPERIENCED

16:00.993 --> 16:03.294
IN THE THE HOUSE
AT ALL, IF ANY.

16:03.329 --> 16:06.397
I'VE HAD MULTIPLE OCCASIONS
OF ACTIVITY

16:06.398 --> 16:08.365
THAT HAPPENED IN THIS HOUSE.
- OKAY.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.068
THERE WAS ALWAYS FOOTSTEPS
MOVING AROUND.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.972
THERE WAS ONE POINT WHERE
I HAD A BUNK BED AT THE TIME,

16:14.007 --> 16:15.138
AND WE SPLIT THE BUNK BEDS

16:15.173 --> 16:17.075
SO MY STEPBROTHER COULD SLEEP
ON THE OTHER ONE.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.978
WE WERE IN THERE, WE WERE
TALKING LATE UP AT NIGHT,

16:19.013 --> 16:22.314
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
WE HEAR, LIKE,

16:22.349 --> 16:23.582
"HELLO, HELLO, HELLO."

16:25.650 --> 16:28.786
AND IT SOUNDED LIKE
THE VOICE WAS RUNNING AT YOU.

16:28.787 --> 16:31.156
AND THEN INSTANTLY,
AS SOON AS THAT "HELLO" STOPPED,

16:31.191 --> 16:34.092
THAT SPARE ROOM --
THAT DOOR SLAMMED SHUT.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.826
THAT'S WEIRD.

16:35.861 --> 16:38.964
YEAH, AND THAT WAS
PROBABLY THE VERY FIRST
EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD.

16:43.134 --> 16:46.536
HOW WAS
YOUR INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS?

16:46.571 --> 16:48.707
I LEARNED THAT CHRIS
DOES NOT THINK IT'S HER MOTHER.

16:48.742 --> 16:51.141
AND THERE'S A RUMOR
ABOUT AN ANGRY MAN

16:51.142 --> 16:52.609
WHO DIED IN THIS HOUSE.

16:52.644 --> 16:55.280
RIGHT. I ASKED AROUND
AND HEARD THAT SAME STORY.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.680
SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS SAID

16:56.681 --> 16:58.883
THAT THERE WAS AN OLDER COUPLE
WHO LIVED HERE AT ONE TIME

16:58.918 --> 17:01.086
AND THAT THE OLDER GENTLEMAN
PASSED AWAY IN THE HOUSE.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.622
SO I WAS TRYING TO DO
SOME RESEARCH ON IT,

17:03.657 --> 17:06.790
AND I WAS ABLE
TO TRACE BACK THE LAND

17:06.826 --> 17:08.159
AND WHO OWNED
THE LAND BEFORE,

17:08.160 --> 17:10.028
AND, YOU KNOW, DEVELOPERS
AND WHO BOUGHT IT.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.294
AND, UNFORTUNATELY,

17:11.329 --> 17:13.498
I THINK THEY MAY HAVE BEEN
RENTERS OR SOMETHING...

17:13.532 --> 17:14.499
OKAY, YEAH.
SO WE DON'T HAVE THEIR NAMES.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.751
...BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
THEIR NAMES.

17:15.786 --> 17:16.933
BUT IT VERY WELL
COULD HAVE HAPPENED,

17:16.968 --> 17:19.304
ESPECIALLY SINCE SO MANY
OF THE NEIGHBORS REMEMBER THEM.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.906
SO, I'M SURE IT HAPPENED.

17:20.941 --> 17:22.906
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHO THEY WERE.

17:22.941 --> 17:24.907
AND WE MAY NEVER FIND OUT.

17:24.943 --> 17:28.079
I THINK THAT, SINCE WE'RE
HAVING A LOT OF ACTIVITY

17:28.114 --> 17:30.046
- THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY IDENTIFIABLE...
- RIGHT.

17:30.081 --> 17:31.783
...I THINK IT'S TIME, MAYBE,

17:31.818 --> 17:34.017
WE BRING IN A PSYCHIC.

17:34.018 --> 17:36.888
AND MY FRIEND STEPHANIE,
SHE CAN COME DO A WALK THROUGH.

17:36.923 --> 17:38.755
I'LL TAKE DOWN
ALL THE FAMILY PHOTOS --

17:38.790 --> 17:42.461
ANYTHING THAT MAY CLUE HER IN
ONTO THIS FAMILY AT ALL.

17:42.496 --> 17:43.494
YES.
TAKE EVERYTHING DOWN.

17:43.529 --> 17:44.663
AND WE'LL HAVE SOMEBODY
GO PICK HER UP.

17:44.698 --> 17:46.182
YEAH, HAVE SOMEBODY
PICK HER UP.

17:46.217 --> 17:47.925
SHE WON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE'S GOING.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.599
STEPHANIE'S A TALENTED PSYCHIC

17:49.634 --> 17:52.003
WHO'S SOLVED SOME
PRETTY MYSTIFYING CASES,

17:52.038 --> 17:53.471
AND I'M HOPING
SHE CAN HELP GET US

17:53.506 --> 17:54.873
GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.039
HI.
- HOW ARE YOU?

17:56.074 --> 17:57.108
GOOD.
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

17:57.143 --> 17:58.143
I KNOW.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.011
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:59.046 --> 17:59.809
YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:59.844 --> 18:02.278
- SO, THIS IS THE DEAL.
- OKAY.

18:02.313 --> 18:03.780
WE'RE JUST GONNA DO

18:03.815 --> 18:06.351
JUST, BASICALLY,
A WALK THROUGH OF THE HOUSE.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.887
AND YOU JUST KIND OF TELL US
YOUR IMPRESSIONS.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.656
AND JUST, NO MATTER
HOW CRAZY IT IS --

18:10.691 --> 18:12.289
- NOTHING WILL SHOCK US.
- GOOD TO KNOW.

18:12.324 --> 18:13.742
SO, ARE YOU READY?

18:13.777 --> 18:15.160
- I THINK SO.
- OKAY.

18:25.103 --> 18:26.271
I'LL GO THIS WAY FIRST.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.442
I'M BEING PULLED
IN THIS DIRECTION FIRST.

18:32.276 --> 18:33.611
IT'S PITCH DARK.

18:33.646 --> 18:34.947
YEAH, I KNOW.

18:37.182 --> 18:39.816
DON'T TURN THE LIGHT ON YET.

18:39.851 --> 18:41.720
I SAW A MAN STANDING
IN THAT CORNER.

18:48.693 --> 18:51.163
DON'T TURN THE LIGHT ON YET.

18:53.798 --> 18:56.835
I SAW A MAN STANDING IN THAT
CORNER, WEARING OVERALLS...

18:56.870 --> 18:59.471
...AND HE TOOK OFF THAT WAY.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.603
OKAY.

19:00.638 --> 19:02.808
SO, I'M GONNA GO SEE
IF I CAN FIND HIM.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.678
WHERE DOES
THIS LEAD ME TO?

19:08.013 --> 19:09.548
OKAY.

19:13.185 --> 19:17.723
OKAY. UM, HE LIKES
TO BOUNCE AROUND.

19:19.424 --> 19:20.442
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE WENT.

19:20.477 --> 19:21.495
- HEY, LET'S GO BACK THIS WAY.
- YEAH.

19:23.395 --> 19:26.931
ARE YOU FEELING ANYONE
THAT MIGHT BE THEIR FAMILY?

19:26.966 --> 19:28.765
THAT VERY WELL COULD BE.

19:28.800 --> 19:32.170
I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING THAT
I'VE ENCOUNTERED SO FAR

19:32.205 --> 19:35.541
IS DEFINITELY CONNECTED
TO THE HOUSE OR THE LAND.

19:35.576 --> 19:36.406
OKAY.

19:36.441 --> 19:38.475
WHATEVER'S HERE...

19:38.510 --> 19:40.846
...WOULD IT,
LIKE, SCRATCH PEOPLE?

19:40.881 --> 19:41.880
UM...

19:45.183 --> 19:46.267
YES.

19:46.302 --> 19:47.351
OKAY.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.752
I FEEL LIKE
IT'S A SCARE TACTIC.

19:48.787 --> 19:52.124
LIKE, HE'S JUST TRYING
TO SCARE WHOEVER IS HERE.

19:52.159 --> 19:54.223
WHAT IS HE TRYING TO DO --
ANY IDEA?

19:54.258 --> 19:57.029
TRYING TO HAVE, LIKE,
THE PLACE TO HIMSELF, I GUESS.

20:00.565 --> 20:03.584
THE MAN IN THE BASEMENT'S
DEMEANOR

20:03.619 --> 20:06.604
SEEMS ALMOST
A NEGATIVE ENERGY.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.374
IT'S NOT THAT FRIENDLY.

20:12.277 --> 20:15.179
I KEEP HEARING,
"I WATCH THEM."

20:15.214 --> 20:18.550
I FEEL LIKE IT'S ALMOST
LIKE A SCARE TACTIC.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.516
YEAH.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.717
LIKE, "I'M GONNA
BE SUPER CREEPY

20:20.718 --> 20:21.985
SO THAT WAY
YOU GUYS ALL RUN OUT,

20:22.020 --> 20:23.722
AND I CAN CONTINUE
DOING WHAT I'M DOING."

20:23.757 --> 20:24.756
OKAY.

20:26.525 --> 20:29.092
I JUST HAD
SOMEBODY POP IN.

20:29.127 --> 20:30.962
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
TO EXPLORE THE BACKYARD.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.132
OKAY.

20:42.607 --> 20:45.543
THERE'S A LOT OF ENERGY HERE,
LIKE, CONNECTED TO THE LAND.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.544
IT'S TOTALLY SEPARATE

20:47.579 --> 20:49.046
FROM EVERYTHING ELSE
THAT'S GOING ON.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.248
IT'S TWO SEPARATE PEOPLE.

20:51.283 --> 20:53.685
SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S,
WHAT, THERE'S A GUY IN THERE?

20:53.720 --> 20:55.218
THERE'S A GUY
IN THE BASEMENT, YES.

20:55.253 --> 20:56.321
BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO
SOMETHING OUT HERE.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.120
YES.

21:01.326 --> 21:03.495
WHAT IS THIS GUY
SHOWING ME?

21:03.530 --> 21:05.629
- IT'S A GUY?
- YEAH,

21:05.664 --> 21:08.400
HE KEEPS --
HE'S NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

21:08.435 --> 21:09.499
ALL HE KEEPS DOING IS, LIKE,

21:09.534 --> 21:11.067
SHOWING ME, LIKE,
FLASHES OF PICTURES.

21:11.102 --> 21:15.506
HE'S SHOWING ME, LIKE,
PULLING UP TO THIS AREA...

21:15.541 --> 21:17.173
BY HORSE.

21:17.208 --> 21:19.443
HE'S SHOWING ME, LIKE,
A SET OF KNIVES.

21:19.478 --> 21:22.245
SHOWING ME
THROWING A BODY IN.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.816
I KEEP GETTING A PULL UP.
I CAN'T EVEN SEE THAT FAR.

21:24.851 --> 21:28.117
- LIKE UP-OVER?
- YEAH.

21:28.152 --> 21:30.455
LIKE, THERE'S A LOT THAT'S
HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT.

21:31.423 --> 21:34.058
IS HE COMING FROM HERE,
OR IS IT LIKE...?

21:34.093 --> 21:36.526
IT WANTS ME
TO WALK UP THAT WAY.

21:36.561 --> 21:39.664
I KEEP FEELING, LIKE,
THIS OLD ENERGY

21:39.699 --> 21:41.450
COMING FROM,
LIKE, THAT AREA.

21:41.485 --> 21:43.166
ALL THE ENERGY
I KEEP PICKING UP

21:43.201 --> 21:46.404
KEEPS, LIKE, ROLLING BACK TO,
LIKE, A TIME BEFORE.

21:46.439 --> 21:49.607
CAN YOU TELL IF WHAT'S HERE
EVER GOES IN THERE?

21:49.642 --> 21:50.774
I'M TRYING
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

21:50.775 --> 21:51.659
OKAY.

21:51.694 --> 21:52.544
UM...

21:54.278 --> 21:56.230
HE'S TELLING ME
HE'S OUTSIDE AND HE'S INSIDE.

21:56.265 --> 21:58.182
I THINK THAT'S ALL
HE'S GONNA GIVE ME FOR NOW.

21:58.217 --> 21:59.184
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S GOOD, THOUGH.

21:59.219 --> 22:00.219
UNTIL SOMETHING ELSE...

22:00.254 --> 22:01.184
- THAT'S FINE.
- YEAH.

22:01.219 --> 22:03.487
WE'LL JUST FOLLOW UP
ON THAT STUFF.

22:03.522 --> 22:07.926
STEPHANIE PICKED UP ON NOT ONE,
BUT TWO DIFFERENT ENTITIES

22:07.961 --> 22:09.793
ON JEANNINE AND CHRIS' PROPERTY.

22:09.794 --> 22:11.830
AND IT SEEMS LIKE
ONE OF THEM WAS INVOLVED

22:11.865 --> 22:14.166
IN SOME KIND
OF VIOLENT INCIDENT.

22:14.201 --> 22:15.565
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO GO ON,

22:15.600 --> 22:18.234
BUT THE TOWN HALL HAS
A WEALTH OF ARCHIVAL RECORDS

22:18.269 --> 22:21.406
THAT COULD MAKE SOME SENSE
OF WHAT STEPHANIE ENCOUNTERED.

22:27.178 --> 22:31.015
I DID FIND OUT SOMETHING
SUPER CREEPY AND WEIRD.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.884
WHAT?

22:32.919 --> 22:34.684
IN 1886...

22:34.719 --> 22:38.472
BASICALLY, THIS GUY
WAS OUT WALKING HIS DOG,

22:38.507 --> 22:42.226
AND HE STUMBLED ACROSS
THIS LARGE SHOEBOX

22:42.227 --> 22:45.229
THAT HAD CARRIED A BUNCH
OF SMALLER SHOEBOXES, BASICALLY.

22:45.264 --> 22:49.232
AND HE NOTICED A WEIRD SMELL
COMING FROM IT,

22:49.267 --> 22:51.936
AND SO HE LEFT AND CAME BACK
WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE,

22:51.971 --> 22:53.603
AND THEY ALL
OPENED IT TOGETHER.

22:53.604 --> 22:54.571
AND IN IT,

22:54.606 --> 22:57.473
THEY FOUND A MALE TORSO...

22:57.508 --> 22:58.775
...WRAPPED IN TAR PAPER,

22:58.810 --> 23:01.713
MISSING HIS ARMS,
HIS HEAD, HIS LEGS --

23:01.748 --> 23:05.149
LITERALLY ON THIS LAND.

23:05.150 --> 23:08.151
AND IT'S UNSOLVED.

23:08.186 --> 23:10.705
I WANTED TO SEE JUST
HOW CLOSE IT WAS TO HERE,

23:10.740 --> 23:13.224
BECAUSE ON, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
A MAP, IT LOOKS --

23:13.259 --> 23:16.093
IF YOU TAKE ROADS,
IT'S LIKE A MILE --

23:16.094 --> 23:17.360
- JUST OVER A MILE.
- RIGHT.

23:17.395 --> 23:20.231
BUT IF YOU JUST WALK UP THIS
HILL BASICALLY --

23:20.266 --> 23:22.065
IT'S RIGHT THERE.
MY GOD.

23:22.100 --> 23:27.472
AND THERE'S A ROAD UP THERE
CALLED "SHOEBOX DRIVE."

23:27.507 --> 23:29.624
BUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD
DIDN'T WANT

23:29.659 --> 23:31.742
TO BE ASSOCIATED
WITH IT ANYMORE,

23:31.777 --> 23:33.743
SO THEY GOT RID
OF THE NAME.

23:33.778 --> 23:36.080
BUT IF YOU LOOK ON, LIKE --
I WAS USING MY GPS,

23:36.115 --> 23:38.250
AND IT STILL SAYS
"SHOEBOX DRIVE"

23:38.285 --> 23:40.385
WHEN YOU GO UP
AND DRIVE UP TO IT.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.485
WHAT'S WEIRD IS THAT...

23:42.520 --> 23:45.354
I WAS READING, LIKE,
A PARANORMAL TEAM'S WEBSITE.

23:45.389 --> 23:50.828
PEOPLE ALL OVER THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT
PARANORMAL PHENOMENA

23:50.863 --> 23:54.232
BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT
THAT GUY HAUNTS THIS WHOLE AREA.

23:56.434 --> 23:57.967
IT'S SO WEIRD.
I'LL SHOW YOU.

23:58.002 --> 23:59.653
THIS -- THIS IS
THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE?

23:59.688 --> 24:01.305
THAT'S ONE
OF THE ORIGINAL ARTICLES.

24:04.976 --> 24:07.245
- AUGUST 9th.
- AUGUST 9th.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.679
IT'S NOW.
IT'S NOW.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.282
THAT'S LITERALLY TODAY --
LIKE LITERALLY TODAY.

24:11.317 --> 24:14.519
1886.

24:16.921 --> 24:20.091
SO, WHAT IS THAT --
130 YEARS AGO EXACTLY?

24:20.126 --> 24:21.024
YEAH.

24:21.059 --> 24:22.793
EXACTLY 130 YEARS AGO.

24:31.002 --> 24:33.871
1886.

24:36.608 --> 24:39.778
SO, WHAT IS THAT --
130 YEARS AGO EXACTLY?

24:39.813 --> 24:40.710
YEAH.

24:40.745 --> 24:42.412
EXACTLY 130 YEARS AGO.

24:43.915 --> 24:47.619
I SAY, LET'S GET INTO THE CAR
AND GO TO THE SHOEBOX ROAD.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.356
STEPHANIE CLEARLY
PICKED UP ON THE MURDERER,

24:51.391 --> 24:53.022
AND OUR RESEARCH VERIFIED IT.

24:53.057 --> 24:55.626
AND SINCE THE SPIRIT
SHE ENCOUNTERED AT
JEANNINE AND CHRIS'

24:55.661 --> 24:57.145
WAS TRYING
TO LEAD HER UP THE HILL

24:57.180 --> 24:58.594
TO WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN
THE MURDER SITE,

24:58.629 --> 25:02.333
WE FIGURE IT'S THE BEST PLACE
TO GET MORE DEFINITIVE ANSWERS.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.734
WE'RE JUST ARRIVING
ON SHOEBOX ROAD.

25:04.769 --> 25:08.406
SO, WE'RE JUST GONNA TRY
AND DO A QUICK EVP SESSION

25:08.441 --> 25:10.542
WITHOUT RILING UP
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

25:10.577 --> 25:12.775
- I MEAN...
- OKAY.

25:12.810 --> 25:15.812
HERE, HERE.
BRING THAT OUT.

25:18.952 --> 25:21.217
HELLO?

25:21.252 --> 25:25.956
IF ANYONE IS HERE,
MY NAME IS AMY,
AND THIS IS ADAM.

25:25.957 --> 25:28.727
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MAN.

25:31.062 --> 25:32.996
WE HEARD
THERE WAS A MURDER HERE.

25:32.997 --> 25:35.934
AND A BOX WAS FOUND,
AND THERE WAS A TORSO OF A MAN.

25:39.337 --> 25:41.840
ARE YOU HIM?

25:46.978 --> 25:49.214
HERE, YOU HOLD THIS.
I'M GONNA GET THE UMBRELLA.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.185
HERE, LET'S LISTEN.

26:03.861 --> 26:05.146
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

26:05.181 --> 26:06.431
YEAH.
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

26:10.601 --> 26:12.103
- "YES."
- "YES," RIGHT?

26:12.138 --> 26:14.237
YES!

26:14.272 --> 26:16.573
HE'S TALKING TO US.

26:16.574 --> 26:18.793
JUST GONNA RUN IT AGAIN.

26:18.828 --> 26:20.570
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

26:20.605 --> 26:22.312
TELL US YOUR STORY,

26:22.313 --> 26:25.583
AND WE WILL MAKE SURE
THE WORLD KNOWS.

26:25.618 --> 26:27.419
WE JUST WANT
TO HELP YOU.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.258
SEE IF WE GOT ANYTHING
ON THAT.

26:44.835 --> 26:47.038
NOTHING.
JUST GOT THAT ONE ANSWER.

26:48.973 --> 26:50.274
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

26:50.309 --> 26:51.575
YEAH, LET'S GO.

26:51.576 --> 26:53.878
WE HAVE TWO SUSPECTS
THAT COULD BE CAUSING

26:53.913 --> 26:55.813
THE PARANORMAL ACTIVITY
IN THIS HOUSE --

26:55.814 --> 26:59.617
THE GRUMPY, OLD PREVIOUS TENANT,
OR THE SHOEBOX MURDER VICTIM.

26:59.652 --> 27:03.421
TO HELP FIND OUT IF THIS MURDER
IS RELATED TO THE HAUNTING,

27:03.456 --> 27:06.458
WE'RE GONNA HEAD BACK
TO THE ROAD WITH STEPHANIE.

27:06.493 --> 27:09.461
I FEEL LIKE THIS AREA
HAS A LOT OF ENERGY.

27:10.361 --> 27:14.164
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

27:14.199 --> 27:16.868
WAS IT SOMEONE
YOU TRUSTED?

27:19.170 --> 27:21.539
DO YOU NEED HELP?

27:22.941 --> 27:27.143
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

27:27.178 --> 27:32.181
ALL RIGHT, LET'S LISTEN.
LORD, HELP ME.

27:32.216 --> 27:35.820
<i> TRY THIS AGAIN.
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?</i>

27:35.855 --> 27:38.489
<i> WAS IT SOMEONE
YOU TRUSTED?</i>

27:38.524 --> 27:40.725
<i> DO YOU NEED HELP?</i>

27:40.760 --> 27:42.927
<i> WHAT IS YOUR NAME?</i>

27:42.962 --> 27:44.093
NOTHING.

27:44.128 --> 27:46.430
I DON'T KNOW. I'M STUMPED.
I THINK THAT'S IT.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.733
ARE YOU GETTING --
DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE --

27:48.768 --> 27:50.533
- NO.
- OKAY.

27:50.568 --> 27:53.238
NO, I FEEL LIKE WHATEVER
ANSWERS WE WERE GETTING
IN THE BEGINNING

27:53.273 --> 27:55.939
QUICKLY GET SHUT OFF.
- IT'S VERY STRANGE.

27:55.974 --> 27:58.376
LIKE SOMEBODY CAME AND WAS LIKE,
"NOPE. SORRY."

27:58.411 --> 27:59.877
WHEN WE WERE DOING
THE SESSION,

27:59.912 --> 28:01.044
I COULD HEAR THE ANSWERS,

28:01.079 --> 28:02.480
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IT WAS...

28:02.515 --> 28:03.679
- GONE.
- ...GONE.

28:03.714 --> 28:07.318
BUT RIGHT NOW,
HE WAS DEFINITELY STOPPED.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.454
WE WERE STOPPED, TOO.

28:13.758 --> 28:16.660
SINCE CHRIS IS A TRIGGER
FOR A LOT OF THE ACTIVITY --

28:16.695 --> 28:19.563
LIKE ALL THE MYSTERIOUS
SCRATCHES ACROSS HIS BODY --

28:19.598 --> 28:21.565
WE'RE BRINGING HIM
FOR TONIGHT'S INVESTIGATION,

28:21.600 --> 28:22.832
AS WELL AS STEPHANIE,

28:22.867 --> 28:26.137
TO SEE IF SHE PICKS UP
ON ANY NEW CLUES.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.938
CHRIS,
THIS IS MY FRIEND STEPH.

28:27.939 --> 28:30.172
STEPHANIE
IS A PSYCHIC MEDIUM.

28:30.207 --> 28:32.243
FIRST THING SHE DID IS
SHE WENT DOWN IN THE BASEMENT,

28:32.278 --> 28:34.312
AND SHE WENT RIGHT
TO THAT BACK WALL

28:34.347 --> 28:36.531
AND SAID,
"THERE'S A MAN RIGHT THERE,

28:36.566 --> 28:38.716
AND HE JUST RAN
INTO THAT HALLWAY."

28:38.751 --> 28:41.216
- SERIOUSLY?
- YEAH.

28:41.251 --> 28:44.338
IS HE,
LIKE, AN OLDER GUY?

28:44.373 --> 28:47.425
HE SEEMS OLDER,
AND ABOUT MY HEIGHT,

28:47.460 --> 28:48.994
OR BETWEEN ADAM AND I.

28:49.029 --> 28:50.493
- THAT'S THE --
- YEAH?

28:50.528 --> 28:52.161
WE HAVE SOME THEORIES ABOUT
WHO IT MIGHT BE.

28:52.196 --> 28:54.298
WE HAVE SOME THEORIES ABOUT
WHY THEY'RE DOING IT.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.484
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
ABOUT A STORY OF --

28:56.519 --> 28:58.636
ABOUT THE STORY
OF THE SHOEBOX MURDER?

29:01.372 --> 29:04.540
IN 1886,
RIGHT UP THE HILL,

29:04.575 --> 29:07.510
THERE WAS
THIS KIND OF LARGE BOX.

29:07.545 --> 29:12.317
THEY OPEN UP THE BOX,
AND THEY FIND A MALE TORSO --

29:12.352 --> 29:14.550
NO ARMS, NO LEGS,
NO HEAD.

29:14.585 --> 29:17.520
IT WAS LITERALLY
RIGHT UP THE HILL FROM HERE.

29:17.555 --> 29:20.825
AND PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED
PARANORMAL ACTIVITY
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,

29:20.860 --> 29:23.879
AND THEY BELIEVE
IT IS CONNECTED TO THAT.

29:23.914 --> 29:26.863
I'VE BEEN HERE ALL MY LIFE --
58 YEARS.

29:26.898 --> 29:30.101
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYBODY
TALK ABOUT THAT, EVER.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.437
WE WANTED YOU TO COME
AND INVESTIGATE,

29:32.472 --> 29:34.738
BECAUSE YOU ARE
THE ONLY ONE IN THE HOUSE

29:34.773 --> 29:36.307
THAT HAS HAD
ANY KIND OF ACTIVITY

29:36.342 --> 29:37.273
THAT'S SORT OF VIOLENT.

29:37.308 --> 29:38.441
IT LEANS TOWARD THE VIOLENT.

29:38.476 --> 29:39.978
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
SCRATCHES ON THE BACK,

29:40.013 --> 29:41.310
THE SCRATCHES
ON THE CHEEK.

29:41.345 --> 29:43.414
AND HAVING YOU HERE
MAY DRAW THE SPIRIT OUT.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.483
THAT WAY, WE COULD
FIGURE OUT WHO IT IS.

29:45.518 --> 29:46.348
YEAH.

29:46.383 --> 29:47.384
WE'RE READY TO GO?

29:47.419 --> 29:48.218
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

29:48.253 --> 29:49.487
LET'S GO, GUYS.

29:59.964 --> 30:02.198
WHOEVER IS HERE WITH US,

30:02.233 --> 30:06.536
WE BROUGHT CHRIS
HOME TONIGHT.

30:06.571 --> 30:11.708
ARE YOU THE ONE THAT'S BEEN
TRYING TO...SCRATCH CHRIS?

30:14.378 --> 30:16.347
YEAH, I CAN HEAR
RESPONSES IN MY HEAD

30:16.382 --> 30:17.848
AS YOU GUYS ARE TALKING.

30:17.883 --> 30:19.015
REALLY?

30:19.050 --> 30:20.618
I JUST HEARD,
"I WANT TO STAY HERE."

30:22.953 --> 30:26.357
WHY WOULD YOU TRY
TO SCARE THE FAMILY?

30:29.660 --> 30:32.063
ARE YOU MAD AT CHRIS?

30:34.498 --> 30:35.966
- OKAY.
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD?

30:36.001 --> 30:37.400
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I CAN --

30:37.401 --> 30:40.804
I THOUGHT I WAS HEARING SOMEONE
TALK OUT OF THIS EAR HERE.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.071
- WEIRD.
- YEAH.

30:42.106 --> 30:44.442
I'M ACTUALLY JUST SITTING HERE.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO QUIET.

30:44.477 --> 30:46.778
I'M LISTENING. I CAN HEAR
SOMEONE TALK LIKE SHE WAS --

30:46.813 --> 30:47.777
LIKE, WHISPERING.

30:47.812 --> 30:50.113
AND I'D SWEAR TO GOD
THAT SHE WAS TALKING.

30:50.114 --> 30:52.016
SO, LET ME SEE.

31:08.899 --> 31:11.901
- I NEVER HEARD THAT.
- SOMETHING "QUIET"?

31:11.902 --> 31:13.904
IT SOUNDS LIKE,
SOMETHING "QUIET."

31:13.939 --> 31:15.506
- YEAH.
- LET ME SEE IT FOR A SECOND.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.074
BUT IT'S MULTIPLE SYLLABLES.

31:17.075 --> 31:17.942
YEAH.

31:22.913 --> 31:24.482
"I NEED QUIET."

31:41.799 --> 31:43.668
"I NEED QUIET."

31:45.303 --> 31:47.338
"I NEED QUIET."

31:47.373 --> 31:48.740
YEAH.

31:51.008 --> 31:53.208
- YEAH, "I NEED QUIET."
- YEP.

31:53.243 --> 31:55.111
WHERE IT'S LIKE IT SENDS
CHILLS THROUGH YOU.

31:55.112 --> 31:59.484
AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE
THE VOICE THAT, LIKE,
WE WERE GETTING THAT,

31:59.519 --> 32:00.716
- "YOU'RE NOT ALONE."
- YEAH.

32:00.751 --> 32:02.718
I WENT INTO THE BASEMENT
ALL BY MYSELF,

32:02.753 --> 32:06.256
AND I SAID, "THIS IS AMY.
I'M DOWN HERE TOTALLY ALONE."

32:06.257 --> 32:08.142
AND A VOICE SAYS,
"YOU'RE NOT ALONE."

32:08.177 --> 32:10.027
- "YOU'RE NOT ALONE."
- "YOU'RE NOT" --

32:10.062 --> 32:12.062
IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE THAT.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.630
I MEAN, THAT, TO ME,

32:13.631 --> 32:15.698
SOUNDS LIKE WHAT
WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH --

32:15.733 --> 32:17.801
THIS THING THAT DOESN'T
REALLY WANT TO TALK TO US.

32:17.836 --> 32:20.102
IT'S JUST KIND OF LIKE,
"I'M OVER YOU."

32:20.103 --> 32:22.573
AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S ACTING OUT
AT YOU GUYS A LITTLE BIT

32:22.608 --> 32:25.074
BECAUSE, I MEAN,
I CAN TELL JUST BEING HERE,

32:25.109 --> 32:27.745
YOU HAVE A HOUSE THAT YOU HAVE
PEOPLE IN AND OUT ALL THE TIME.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.045
IT'S ALWAYS GOING, YEAH.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.615
AND THAT WHATEVER IS HERE
DOES NOT LIKE THAT.

32:33.351 --> 32:35.684
IT IS LIKE, "I NEED QUIET."

32:35.719 --> 32:37.119
SO I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED

32:37.154 --> 32:39.023
IF IT'S ONE
OF THE FORMER HOMEOWNERS.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.842
BUT, I MEAN,
THAT SOUNDS TO ME

32:40.877 --> 32:42.592
LIKE SOMEBODY WHO,
IS THEIR SPACE,

32:42.627 --> 32:45.179
AND THEY ARE LIKE,
"STOP. THAT IS ENOUGH."

32:45.214 --> 32:47.732
OLD MAN AND OLD LADY
THAT LIVED HERE...

32:48.966 --> 32:50.834
NOW, I WAS TOLD THAT
THE OLD MAN DIED IN HERE.

32:50.835 --> 32:52.937
BUT IF YOU GUYS DIDN'T FIND
THAT, YOU DIDN'T FIND THAT.

32:52.972 --> 32:54.237
YEAH.
WE HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET.

32:54.238 --> 32:56.274
THE OLD MAN
WAS A NASTY GUY.

32:56.309 --> 32:57.440
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

32:57.441 --> 32:59.508
- OKAY.
- SO...

32:59.543 --> 33:00.977
JUST TO HEAR THAT VOICE --

33:00.978 --> 33:03.179
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN OLD MAN.
- YEAH, LIKE AN OLD MAN.

33:03.214 --> 33:08.185
AND IT'S TRYING HARD
TO, LIKE, MAKE IT SO
IT'S JUST NOT FRIENDLY

33:08.220 --> 33:09.486
SO EVERYBODY WILL
JUST GO AWAY.

33:19.897 --> 33:21.331
USUALLY,
WHEN WE DO THESE CASES,

33:21.332 --> 33:22.733
THERE'S, LIKE,
LOTS OF LITTLE LAYERS...

33:23.801 --> 33:25.101
...AND THEN WE'RE
ABLE TO PINPOINT,

33:25.102 --> 33:27.972
LIKE, ONE OR TWO THAT ACTUALLY
MAKE SENSE TO THIS LOCATION.

33:28.007 --> 33:30.139
- THIS LOCATION HAS
MULTIPLE LAYERS. - YEAH.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.341
LIKE, IT DOESN'T --

33:31.342 --> 33:33.110
THERE'S NOT JUST ONE PERSON
IN THIS SPACE.

33:33.145 --> 33:34.277
NO.

33:34.278 --> 33:36.379
ALL THE ACTIVITY
THAT'S TRYING TO SCARE US,

33:36.414 --> 33:38.882
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S PROBABLY
THE PREVIOUS HOMEOWNER...

33:38.917 --> 33:40.116
"YOU'RE NOT ALONE."

33:40.151 --> 33:42.686
...WHO'S ALSO RESPONSIBLE
FOR SCRATCHING CHRIS.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.855
BUT I DO THINK
THAT IT'S NOT EVIL.

33:44.890 --> 33:45.988
- NO.
- IT'S GRUMPY.

33:46.023 --> 33:47.958
BUT THEN,
WHATEVER IS OUT THERE,

33:47.959 --> 33:51.128
MAYBE THAT --
THE SHOEBOX MURDER VICTIM.

33:51.163 --> 33:54.263
I FEEL LIKE THAT PERSON
DOES WANDER THROUGH.

33:54.298 --> 33:56.333
STEPHANIE WAS PINPOINTING
TO THE THINGS WHERE IT'S LIKE,

33:56.368 --> 33:57.400
IT WAS SPOT-ON.

33:57.435 --> 33:58.802
HE'S SHOWING ME, LIKE,
A SET OF KNIVES.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.303
SHOWING ME
THROWING A BODY IN.

34:00.304 --> 34:02.773
EVERYTHING SHE WAS SAYING
RELATED TO THE SHOEBOX MURDER.

34:02.808 --> 34:05.207
BUT ONE THING WE DIDN'T GET
WAS ANYTHING ON THE MOM.

34:05.242 --> 34:07.712
THAT'S WHO JEANNINE THOUGHT WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIVITY.

34:07.747 --> 34:10.215
THIS IS A COLLIE
THAT MY MOTHER HAD.

34:10.250 --> 34:12.683
IT DID FALL OFF THE TOP SHELF
ALL ON ITS OWN.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.835
I MEAN, MY HUNCH IS THAT

34:14.871 --> 34:16.918
- HER FAMILY'S TALKING TO HER.
- RIGHT.

34:16.954 --> 34:19.222
AND I THINK JEANNINE
NEEDS TO COME IN.

34:19.257 --> 34:20.255
SO, IF SHE COMES IN,

34:20.291 --> 34:22.091
HOPEFULLY SHE'LL GET
AN ANSWER FROM THEM.

34:22.126 --> 34:23.559
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GONNA COME TO US.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.963
BUT I THINK SHE MIGHT BE THE KEY
TO GETTING A RESPONSE FROM THEM.

34:25.998 --> 34:27.027
WE HAVE
A DIRECTION TO GO IN.

34:27.063 --> 34:29.433
ALL RIGHT.
SO, LET'S GET READY FOR TONIGHT.

34:30.434 --> 34:31.900
- AND LET'S TALK TO JEANNINE.
- YES.

34:31.935 --> 34:34.103
TO ME,
OUR INVESTIGATION ISN'T DONE

34:34.138 --> 34:36.170
UNTIL WE RULE OUT
ALL THE POSSIBILITIES.

34:36.206 --> 34:39.277
AND WE CAN'T RULE OUT
THAT JEANNINE'S MOM ISN'T HERE.

34:39.312 --> 34:41.379
FROM OUR YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE DOING THIS,

34:41.414 --> 34:42.913
WE KNOW THAT FAMILY SPIRITS

34:42.914 --> 34:44.815
COULD BE MORE ATTACHED
TO THE PEOPLE

34:44.850 --> 34:46.149
RATHER THAN THE HOUSE.

34:46.184 --> 34:47.614
SO, BY BRINGING JEANNINE IN,

34:47.650 --> 34:50.152
WE'RE HOPING SHE'LL BE
THE TRIGGER FOR HER MOTHER.

34:50.187 --> 34:53.121
SO, LAST NIGHT
WE GOT SOME RESULTS,

34:53.123 --> 34:56.494
BUT I DON'T THINK WE REALLY GOT
ANYTHING THAT MADE US THINK

34:56.529 --> 34:58.529
WE WERE TALKING
TO ANY OF YOUR RELATIVES.

34:59.997 --> 35:03.100
AND WE LIKE, SOMETIMES,
TO HAVE YOU ACTUALLY
INVESTIGATE WITH US,

35:03.135 --> 35:05.701
BECAUSE IT HELPS US
A LOT WHEN --

35:05.736 --> 35:08.138
THEY'RE MORE FAMILIAR WITH YOU
THAN THEY ARE WITH US.

35:17.080 --> 35:20.785
OKAY,
SO WHOEVER'S HERE WITH US,

35:20.820 --> 35:23.085
JEANNINE IS HERE
NOW, TOO,

35:23.120 --> 35:26.490
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO HER.

35:26.525 --> 35:30.528
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO HER?

35:31.495 --> 35:34.263
MOM, IF YOU'RE AROUND,

35:34.298 --> 35:37.801
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME,

35:37.836 --> 35:40.002
TALK TO ME ABOUT?

35:40.037 --> 35:42.371
YOU AND I HAD
A BIG FALLING OUT

35:42.406 --> 35:46.108
THAT I'M STILL CONFUSED
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

35:46.143 --> 35:50.281
AND YOU PASSED WITHOUT KNOWING
YOU WERE GONNA PASS.

35:53.117 --> 35:57.455
DO YOU FORGIVE ME,
AS I HAVE FORGIVEN YOU?

35:59.823 --> 36:01.391
LET'S SEE
IF WE GOT ANY ANSWERS.

36:15.739 --> 36:17.674
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- WOW. THAT --

36:17.709 --> 36:19.610
MY GOD.
I JUST GOT THE CHILLS.

36:23.614 --> 36:25.180
- THAT'S HER VOICE.
- IT IS?

36:25.215 --> 36:26.484
THAT'S MY MOTHER.

36:42.766 --> 36:44.634
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- WOW.

36:44.669 --> 36:46.468
THAT'S MY MOTHER'S VOICE.

36:46.503 --> 36:48.305
MY GOD.
I JUST GOT THE CHILLS.

36:52.476 --> 36:53.776
WHAT IS SHE SAYING?

36:53.811 --> 36:56.029
SHE'S SAYING SOMETHING,
BUT I CAN'T...

36:56.064 --> 36:58.248
BUT IT ALMOST SOUNDS
LIKE THREE SYLLABLES.

36:58.283 --> 36:59.315
BUT THAT'S HER TONE.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.617
THAT MIGHT BE
HER FIRST BIG GO

37:01.652 --> 37:04.321
AT, LIKE, USING WHATEVER
ENERGY IT TAKES

37:04.356 --> 37:05.721
TO GET THAT OUT.

37:05.722 --> 37:09.193
I MEAN, IT'S NOT CLEAR,
BUT AT LEAST SHE'S TRYING.

37:09.228 --> 37:10.794
THAT WAS WILD
TO HEAR HER VOICE.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.027
HOW ARE -- ARE YOU OKAY?

37:12.062 --> 37:14.298
LIKE I SAID, THE LAST WORDS
SHE SAID TO ME WAS,

37:14.333 --> 37:15.966
"I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW,"

37:16.001 --> 37:17.132
AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.

37:17.167 --> 37:20.369
- AND NOW JUST TO HEAR
HER VOICE AGAIN... - YES.

37:20.404 --> 37:22.405
I MEAN, IMMEDIATELY...

37:22.440 --> 37:25.542
LIKE, I GOT THE CHILLS
JUST RUN RIGHT THROUGH ME.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.242
AND, SUDDENLY,
THOSE LAST WORDS

37:27.277 --> 37:28.646
AREN'T HER LAST WORDS
TO YOU ANYMORE.

37:28.681 --> 37:29.679
- NO.
- MNH-MNH.

37:29.714 --> 37:30.881
IT'S WHATEVER
SHE'S SAYING RIGHT THERE,

37:30.916 --> 37:32.114
- WHICH IS WILD.
- YEAH.

37:32.149 --> 37:34.817
YOU KNOW, THAT TOOK AWAY
THAT LITTLE BIT OF HURT,

37:34.818 --> 37:36.184
- LIKE YOU SAID...
- YEAH.

37:36.219 --> 37:38.087
...OF ALL THOSE YEARS.

37:38.122 --> 37:40.725
I GOT TO GET A...

37:41.828 --> 37:42.827
A LITTLE BIT.

37:49.667 --> 37:50.733
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

37:50.768 --> 37:53.637
YEAH. IT'S JUST --
THANK YOU, AMY.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.305
I KNOW.
THAT'S SO HARD.

37:55.340 --> 37:56.557
THAT'S SO TOUGH.

37:56.592 --> 37:57.739
- YOU KNOW?
- I KNOW.

37:57.774 --> 38:00.844
TO NOT HAVE THAT AS
HER LAST WORDS TO ME ANYMORE.

38:01.979 --> 38:03.379
I KNOW IT'S TOUGH.

38:03.380 --> 38:04.648
THANK YOU, ADAM.

38:04.683 --> 38:05.916
YOU'RE WELCOME.

38:05.951 --> 38:06.884
THANK YOU.

38:11.521 --> 38:12.689
I'M GLAD
WE COULD PROVIDE IT.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.090
THANK YOU.

38:14.125 --> 38:17.628
I THINK LOSING A PARENT
AT ANY POINT IS VERY TOUGH.

38:17.663 --> 38:18.794
BUT LOSING A PARENT,

38:18.829 --> 38:20.462
AND THE LAST THING
THEY SAY TO YOU IS,

38:20.497 --> 38:23.299
"I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOU,"
IS DEVASTATING.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.986
HAVING JEANNINE SIT DOWN
AND ACTUALLY TALK TO HER MOM

38:26.021 --> 38:28.672
AND HAVING HER MOM COME THROUGH
THAT ONE LITTLE TIME

38:28.707 --> 38:30.105
IS REALLY GREAT.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.810
I MEAN, IT'S SOMETHING THAT
HER MOTHER WANTED TO MAKE HAPPEN

38:32.845 --> 38:35.245
AND SOMETHING THAT
JEANNINE REALLY NEEDED.

38:40.483 --> 38:42.853
THERE WERE A LOT MORE SPIRITS
HERE THAN WE EXPECTED,

38:42.888 --> 38:44.453
AND I HOPE THAT THE HOMEOWNERS

38:44.488 --> 38:46.021
ARE READY TO HEAR
WHAT WE HAVE TO SHARE.

38:46.056 --> 38:48.191
I THINK THAT THE FIRST THING
WE SHOULD PROBABLY TALK ABOUT

38:48.226 --> 38:49.743
IS YOUR FAMILY.

38:51.261 --> 38:54.064
THE ONLY TIME WE EVER GOT
ANYTHING REGARDING YOUR FAMILY

38:54.099 --> 38:55.197
WAS WHEN YOU WERE THERE

38:55.232 --> 38:56.898
AND WHEN YOU HEARD
YOUR MOM'S VOICE.

38:56.933 --> 39:01.105
WHILE SHE CAME HERE AND GAVE
A LITTLE MESSAGE AND LEFT,

39:01.140 --> 39:03.673
SHE'S NOT THE ONLY THING
THAT WE FOUND, OF COURSE.

39:03.708 --> 39:06.709
SHE'S NOT.

39:06.710 --> 39:10.247
IN 1886, THERE WAS
A VERY LARGE SHOEBOX.

39:10.282 --> 39:11.380
VERY BIG.

39:11.415 --> 39:14.750
AND INSIDE,
THEY DISCOVERED A MALE TORSO.

39:14.751 --> 39:16.251
IT WAS NEVER SOLVED.

39:16.286 --> 39:19.056
BUT THE THING IS THAT
THE SHOEBOX MURDER HAPPENED

39:19.091 --> 39:22.125
DIRECTLY UP THE HILL
BEHIND YOUR HOUSE.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.392
WHILE DOING MY RESEARCH,

39:23.427 --> 39:26.580
I ALSO DISCOVERED
THAT HOMES IN THIS AREA

39:26.615 --> 39:29.734
HAVE REPORTED
STRANGE ACTIVITY GOING ON.

39:29.769 --> 39:31.334
DO WE THINK HE'S HERE
ALL THE TIME?

39:31.369 --> 39:32.602
NO.

39:32.603 --> 39:35.705
DO WE THINK HE'S THE ONE
CAUSING ALL THE DRAMA?

39:35.740 --> 39:37.274
- NO.
- NO.

39:39.276 --> 39:42.812
AND SO, THAT BRINGS US
TO SUSPECT NUMBER THREE.

39:42.813 --> 39:44.280
THERE'S A SHADOW FIGURE

39:44.315 --> 39:46.517
THAT YOU GUYS SEE
PRETTY REGULARLY.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.669
AND STEPHANIE CAME
IN THE HOUSE,

39:48.704 --> 39:50.752
SHE WENT DOWN
INTO THE BASEMENT,

39:50.787 --> 39:53.057
AND SHE WENT,
"THERE'S A MAN STANDING THERE.

39:53.092 --> 39:55.457
HE JUST DARTED BACK
INTO THAT ROOM."

39:55.458 --> 39:57.659
HE'S MISCHIEVOUS
AND HOSTILE,

39:57.694 --> 40:00.330
BUT ULTIMATELY JUST WANTS
TO BE LEFT ALONE.

40:00.365 --> 40:02.098
THIS IS WHERE
WE STARTED REALIZING

40:02.099 --> 40:03.868
IT WAS REALLY TRYING
TO MESS WITH US.

40:07.771 --> 40:09.673
LISTEN.
- WHAT WAS THAT?

40:09.708 --> 40:11.006
"YOU'RE NOT ALONE."

40:11.007 --> 40:13.410
YEAH,
SO THEN THAT BRINGS US TO...

40:13.445 --> 40:14.376
MY GOD.

40:14.411 --> 40:17.481
...OUR INVESTIGATION
WITH CHRIS.

40:21.819 --> 40:22.784
YEAH.

40:22.819 --> 40:24.219
LIKE,
"I WANT YOU TO BE QUIET."

40:24.254 --> 40:26.756
LIKE, IT'S TRYING --
IT'S JUST EXASPERATED,

40:26.791 --> 40:28.425
AND IT'S LIKE,
"I NEED QUIET."

40:28.460 --> 40:30.025
LIKE,
THAT'S WHAT IT WANTS.

40:30.060 --> 40:33.830
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE THINK
THAT THE PERFECT EXPLANATION

40:33.865 --> 40:34.896
IS A GRUMPY, OLD MAN.

40:34.931 --> 40:36.331
SOMEONE WHO LIVED HERE.

40:36.366 --> 40:39.703
HE'S THE PERSON THAT
IS PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE

40:39.738 --> 40:42.238
FOR MOST
OF YOUR ACTIVITY.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.458
I MEAN, ALL OF THESE VOICES
SOUND THE SAME --

40:44.493 --> 40:46.643
THE "YOU'RE NOT ALONE VOICE,"
THE GRUFF VOICE,

40:46.678 --> 40:48.195
THE "I NEED QUIET" VOICE.

40:48.230 --> 40:49.678
IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S MAD.

40:49.713 --> 40:51.448
LIKE, HE'S LIKE,
"WHO YOU MESSING WITH?"

40:51.483 --> 40:52.814
- LIKE, BEING A WISE-ASS.
- YEAH.

40:52.849 --> 40:54.951
THIS IS WHY WE THINK THAT
WHEN YOU'RE RENOVATING,

40:54.986 --> 40:56.619
THINGS START
GETTING MORE ACTIVE.

40:56.654 --> 40:58.455
MORE ACTIVITY WHEN
WE TEAR THINGS APART.

40:58.490 --> 40:59.587
- RIGHT.
- EXACTLY.

40:59.622 --> 41:01.489
AND SO,
THIS IS WHY, YOU KNOW,

41:01.524 --> 41:04.160
<i> YOU</i> ESPECIALLY, BECAUSE
YOU'RE THE MAN OF THE HOUSE,

41:04.195 --> 41:05.494
YOU KNOW, HE...

41:05.529 --> 41:07.864
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PUT HIM
IN HIS PLACE SOMETIMES,

41:07.899 --> 41:09.199
AND, LIKE,
REALLY BE FIRM WITH HIM.

41:09.234 --> 41:10.718
SO, JUST TAKE
THE UPPER HAND.

41:10.753 --> 41:12.167
AND IF YOU'RE GONNA
RENOVATE,

41:12.202 --> 41:13.637
SAY, "HEY, LISTEN, I'M GONNA
DO SOME RENOVATION WORK,

41:13.672 --> 41:14.936
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW."

41:14.971 --> 41:18.708
AND HE IS PROBABLY DOING THINGS
TO INTIMIDATE YOU

41:18.743 --> 41:22.446
BECAUSE HE JUST WANTS YOU
TO KIND OF GO AWAY.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.047
AIN'T GONNA MAKE ME GO.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.518
SO, WHAT ARE
YOUR THOUGHTS NOW?

41:27.553 --> 41:28.651
- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?
- AWESOME.

41:28.686 --> 41:31.455
BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO ME,
AND I KNOW WHAT I HEARD,

41:31.490 --> 41:33.222
I KNOW WHAT I SAW,
AND STUFF LIKE THIS.

41:33.257 --> 41:36.560
AND IT'S RIGHT THERE --
PROOF THAT I'M NOT CRAZY,

41:36.595 --> 41:37.561
AND NEITHER IS SHE.

41:37.596 --> 41:38.594
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

41:38.629 --> 41:39.730
I'M GLAD YOU GUYS
CAME HERE, BECAUSE...

41:39.765 --> 41:40.829
FOR SURE.

41:40.864 --> 41:43.298
...NOW YOU MADE ME
FEEL BETTER FOR HER, TOO.

41:43.333 --> 41:45.669
DEFINITELY MADE ME FEEL BETTER,
BECAUSE IT'S JUST --

41:45.704 --> 41:47.069
- KNOWING ABOUT MY MOTHER...
- YEAH.

41:47.104 --> 41:49.189
...AND THE LAST WORDS
THAT SHE SAID TO ME.

41:49.224 --> 41:51.274
NOW, LIKE YOU SAID,
I HAVE NEW LAST WORDS.

41:52.928 --> 41:54.476
YEAH.

41:54.511 --> 41:57.045
AND IT'S NICE KNOWING

41:57.080 --> 42:00.116
THAT I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
TO THINK ABOUT NOW

42:00.117 --> 42:01.850
INSTEAD OF THOSE WORDS.

42:01.885 --> 42:03.286
I'M GLAD WE COULD DO THAT
FOR YOU.

42:03.321 --> 42:04.687
- YEAH, THAT'S AWESOME.
- THANK YOU.

42:04.688 --> 42:07.524
THIS WEEK HAS BEEN
INCREDIBLY THERAPEUTIC.

42:07.559 --> 42:08.790
NOW THAT JEANNINE KNOWS

42:08.825 --> 42:11.127
HER MOM HAS BEEN TRYING
TO MAKE AMENDS,

42:11.162 --> 42:13.395
SHE CAN FINALLY LET GO
OF HER GRIEF.

42:13.430 --> 42:16.031
I KEPT THE PHOTOS
OF MY MOTHER IN A CLOSET

42:16.032 --> 42:17.366
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS.

42:17.401 --> 42:20.736
NOW I AM PUTTING HER PICTURE
BACK IN THE BEDROOM.

42:20.737 --> 42:24.139
IT JUST FELT GOOD
TO SEE HER AGAIN.

42:24.174 --> 42:26.677
AND KNOWING THAT
THE SOURCE OF ALL THEIR ACTIVITY

42:26.712 --> 42:29.430
IS NOTHING BUT
A HARMLESS, GRUMPY, OLD MAN

42:29.465 --> 42:32.149
SHOULD SET JEANNINE AND CHRIS'
MINDS AT EASE,

42:32.184 --> 42:33.950
ALLOWING THEM
TO MOVE CONFIDENTLY AHEAD

42:33.985 --> 42:35.185
WITH FUTURE RENOVATIONS.
