01:52.245 --> 01:53.371
Ohh.

01:53.413 --> 01:55.210
You see what happened there?

01:55.248 --> 01:56.715
I'm pretty sure you hit me.

01:56.749 --> 01:58.808
No. I give you left, left.

01:58.851 --> 02:01.285
You think I'll give another
left, and I gave you a right.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.653
I'm just telling you...

02:05.692 --> 02:07.660
that's what boxing's
all about, OK?

02:07.694 --> 02:09.217
You show your opponent
one thing,

02:09.262 --> 02:11.662
and you do
something else.

02:11.698 --> 02:14.166
That's how Ali took
the title from Foreman.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.828
He beat him with a rope-a-dope.
Don't you remember?

02:16.869 --> 02:18.632
I don't remember what day
of the week it is.

02:21.741 --> 02:24.073
That's right. Everyone thought
Ali's arms had run out,

02:24.110 --> 02:26.977
that he's on empty, but he's
just setting Foreman up.

02:27.013 --> 02:28.981
He's letting him
burn himself out.

02:30.583 --> 02:32.551
And then in the eighth round,
he comes.

02:38.891 --> 02:40.552
Poor George
has got nothing left.

02:41.928 --> 02:43.828
I always liked
Bruce Lee movies.

02:49.736 --> 02:51.169
Now you're learning.

02:55.575 --> 02:58.009
Don't look at my hands.
Look at my shoulder.

02:58.044 --> 02:59.978
That's where the punch
is coming from.

03:00.012 --> 03:01.001
See?

03:05.518 --> 03:06.815
You're still
looking at my hands.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.252
Now come on,
let's try it again.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.022
Come on, focus!
Come on! Shoulders, shoulders!

04:18.825 --> 04:21.658
- Here.
- Nah. You keep it.

04:21.694 --> 04:24.822
- Come on, you won.
- Yeah, but I always win.

04:24.864 --> 04:27.059
I mean, I feel
so guilty about it.

04:27.099 --> 04:28.862
Shut up and take it.

04:35.741 --> 04:38.005
You know why you didn't
beat me today, Hale?

04:38.044 --> 04:39.944
You've been boxing
for 20 years...

04:39.979 --> 04:42.038
and you're better at it
than I am?

04:44.150 --> 04:47.347
No. You don't have
the will to win.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.447
Well, your insight
is shattering.

04:50.490 --> 04:51.684
You had me today.

04:51.724 --> 04:54.420
You could have shut me down,
but you blinked.

04:56.596 --> 04:59.292
Yeah, well, we were
only sparring, buddy.

05:00.199 --> 05:02.997
Thinking like that
is exactly why you lost.

05:03.035 --> 05:05.970
- Now take this.
- It's yours.

05:06.005 --> 05:07.199
No, no, no, take it.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.367
If you didn't give it
everything you've got,

05:09.408 --> 05:11.467
then I don't want it.
Go ahead.

05:11.511 --> 05:13.706
You don't understand.
It really is yours.

05:13.746 --> 05:16.408
I took it out of your wallet
while you were in the shower.

05:33.832 --> 05:35.925
- General.
- General.

05:38.537 --> 05:41.506
Major, were you recently
promoted past me?

05:41.540 --> 05:42.507
No, sir.

05:42.541 --> 05:45.169
Then why are you smoking
in my briefing room?

05:45.210 --> 05:48.373
Sorry about that, sir.
That will never happen again.

05:51.717 --> 05:52.706
Sit.

05:55.821 --> 05:57.948
You take off in the Stealth
at 0-dark-30.

05:57.990 --> 06:00.823
Fly a simulated,
low-level border penetration.

06:01.493 --> 06:03.120
Nap of the earth
all the way.

06:03.161 --> 06:07.120
- Scare cows, wake the farmers.
- Not tonight, buddy.

06:07.165 --> 06:09.929
We're flying the B3
with two live nukes.

06:10.669 --> 06:12.136
Palmdale's
concerned about...

06:12.170 --> 06:13.797
low-level gamma
and x-ray diffusion...

06:13.839 --> 06:15.306
screwing up the peripherals.

06:15.340 --> 06:19.436
They want to send up a couple,
see if anything glows.

06:19.478 --> 06:23.346
- 61s?
- Big ones. 83s.

06:23.382 --> 06:26.112
Whoo! Crowd pleasers.

06:49.207 --> 06:52.802
- How's your head?
- All right. I'll be fine.

06:52.844 --> 06:54.505
I'm sorry about that.

06:54.546 --> 06:56.309
Don't worry.
I'll get you back.

06:56.348 --> 06:58.407
Ah, now you're dreaming.

06:58.884 --> 07:00.317
After you, major.

07:25.043 --> 07:27.443
These exercises are fantastic.

07:27.479 --> 07:29.310
When we go to war
against Utah,

07:29.348 --> 07:31.509
we are really going
to kick ass.

07:39.424 --> 07:41.449
Ground control,
ready for rollout.

08:24.169 --> 08:25.329
Park ranger.

08:26.338 --> 08:28.306
I'd like to speak to you
about this campfire.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.672
- Should I go?
- No, Wanda. You stay put.

08:31.843 --> 08:35.609
Yeah, I know.
No wood fires in the park.

08:35.647 --> 08:37.842
Wanda has a cold,
and I'm trying to keep her warm.

08:37.883 --> 08:39.851
Sir, have you seen
any other hikers...

08:39.885 --> 08:42.251
or campers
in this area?

08:42.287 --> 08:46.053
Not this time of year.
What's the fine for this?

08:46.091 --> 08:47.388
Pretty steep.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.462
Secured.

09:17.389 --> 09:20.984
Jesus Christ.
Drag him out of there.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.821
Be smelling that all night.

09:33.171 --> 09:36.197
Climb heading 287,
flight level 200.

09:36.241 --> 09:38.835
That's 287, 200.

09:40.045 --> 09:41.808
I don't think
that Aurora Project...

09:41.847 --> 09:44.645
is going to happen for me.
Spoke to your buddy Taylor.

09:44.683 --> 09:47.811
He doesn't feel like I have
enough fighter time to qualify.

09:47.853 --> 09:49.343
And what did you
say to him?

09:49.387 --> 09:51.480
Thank you very much,
sir. Good-bye.

09:51.523 --> 09:53.491
You'll never change, will you?

09:53.525 --> 09:56.585
And that, my friend,
will be your downfall.

09:56.628 --> 09:59.995
- Know what your problem is?
- Yeah. I'm always right.

10:00.031 --> 10:03.364
- You think you're always right.
- That's deep.

10:04.202 --> 10:06.329
You should have made
colonel by now,

10:06.371 --> 10:09.033
but you're too busy pushing
at everybody all the time.

10:09.541 --> 10:12.806
That's an awesome
responsibility, isn't it?

10:18.884 --> 10:21.045
McMurren control,
this is Go-Seven.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.211
Colonel, you boys
in Utah still awake?

10:24.256 --> 10:26.884
Copy, Major Deakins.
We're ready and waiting.

10:27.392 --> 10:28.791
Be advised,
we're going to catch...

10:28.827 --> 10:31.591
your sorry little butts
this morning and bite down hard.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.530
You may pass that
along to Captain Hale...

10:33.565 --> 10:35.192
with my compliments.

10:35.233 --> 10:37.758
Wilkins is giving us attitude.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.464
You want to take
a turn tonight?

10:40.405 --> 10:42.703
I'll fly in one ear
and out the other.

10:42.741 --> 10:44.208
He won't even know
we were there.

10:44.242 --> 10:48.076
Hale says that
if anyone can catch us, you can.

10:49.347 --> 10:51.042
And everyone get a fix.

10:51.082 --> 10:53.243
They're about to
turn out the lights.

11:06.698 --> 11:09.758
- Ready, captain?
- On your command, major.

11:09.801 --> 11:11.098
Go to war.

11:11.536 --> 11:13.527
Initiating stealth mode.

11:17.108 --> 11:19.372
River valley approach.
Here we go.

11:25.717 --> 11:27.344
Colonel, they've gone
to stealth mode.

11:27.385 --> 11:31.344
We lost them on radar.
Anybody still holding?

11:31.389 --> 11:33.357
Got capture on their
heat signature, sir.

11:33.391 --> 11:35.188
- Good.
- They may be running cold,

11:35.227 --> 11:37.195
but the air above
ten-five is colder.

11:37.229 --> 11:39.026
Good man, Frenchy.
I like that.

11:39.064 --> 11:41.191
Descend to 400 feet AGL,

11:41.233 --> 11:43.531
altimeter setting 3001.

11:43.568 --> 11:47.470
Air speed
.7 Mach 3001, 400 feet.

11:47.505 --> 11:49.234
Nap of the earth.
Here we go.

12:07.859 --> 12:10.157
Terry, you been
through the Needles entrance?

12:10.195 --> 12:12.561
- No, why?
- Mrs. Parker just called.

12:12.597 --> 12:16.294
Oh, God. What is it this time?
Another UFO?

12:16.334 --> 12:18.199
Or did Elvis drop by for dinner?

12:18.870 --> 12:21.168
She didn't mention him
but said a bunch of trucks...

12:21.206 --> 12:23.174
went through the Needles
entrance an hour ago,

12:23.208 --> 12:25.506
and she thought
they looked suspicious.

12:26.544 --> 12:30.537
Clyde, what exactly does
a suspicious truck look like?

12:31.049 --> 12:33.517
I don't know, and I have no idea.

12:33.551 --> 12:35.041
Me neither.

12:35.553 --> 12:39.011
The thing is, she said
one of the trucks was ours.

12:39.057 --> 12:42.220
You're the only one out tonight,
so if it wasn't you...

12:43.228 --> 12:45.856
She was probably
just hallucinating.

12:45.897 --> 12:47.694
Don't worry.
I'll check it out.

12:57.876 --> 13:00.071
- Lost them.
- Damn.

13:00.679 --> 13:02.271
Come on, keep hunting.
Keep hunting.

13:04.015 --> 13:07.348
We're below their eyes.
Proceed to primary target.

13:08.186 --> 13:10.177
Descending to 200 feet.

13:10.722 --> 13:12.815
Ridge coming up in 6 seconds.

13:12.857 --> 13:14.518
I got it.

13:23.635 --> 13:25.967
Whoo! Very nicely done.

13:26.004 --> 13:27.972
- Excellent.
- Switching to autopilot.

13:28.006 --> 13:29.997
Almost
as good as me.

13:30.041 --> 13:33.067
I left a few trees behind.
I'll try to do better next time.

13:33.111 --> 13:34.976
You really love
this shit, don't you?

13:35.547 --> 13:37.674
Where else can you fly
a $2 billion plane...

13:37.716 --> 13:40.184
800 miles an hour
100 feet off the ground?

13:40.218 --> 13:42.846
That is a fact.
That is a fact.

13:45.056 --> 13:46.717
You're in for life, huh?

13:47.392 --> 13:49.121
As long as they'll have me.
Aren't you?

13:49.160 --> 13:51.890
Nah, nah.
I don't think so.

13:52.731 --> 13:53.925
I mean, come on.

13:55.567 --> 13:59.025
You said it yourself,
I should be colonel by now.

13:59.070 --> 14:01.800
Instead, idiots like Boone
become general.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.808
Boone is not
such a bad guy.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.810
If he had a thought
go through his head,

14:05.844 --> 14:07.835
it would be the quickest trip
in North America.

14:09.414 --> 14:10.847
Oh, nah.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.281
Flying doesn't mean
what it used to mean to me.

14:15.854 --> 14:18.652
Not the flying.
Carrying the nukes. I know you.

14:18.690 --> 14:21.318
You love having the power of God
at your fingertips.

14:21.359 --> 14:23.190
You get off on it.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.511
Look out your window.
There's something wrong...

14:40.545 --> 14:42.012
with the terrain
following here.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.379
Shouldn't that starboard ridge
be on our port side?

14:54.793 --> 14:56.124
Aah!

15:13.211 --> 15:15.179
Here she comes.

15:24.923 --> 15:25.912
No!

15:27.892 --> 15:30.827
What the hell are you doing?

16:02.227 --> 16:04.286
Clyde, I'm looking
at half a valley,

16:04.329 --> 16:06.388
and there's nothing going...

16:10.001 --> 16:11.798
Holy shit!

16:51.475 --> 16:52.840
I got them!

16:56.547 --> 16:57.411
McMurren!

16:57.448 --> 17:01.384
This is Deakins! Hale's lost it!
I'm punching out!

17:28.579 --> 17:30.547
Oh, shit!

17:33.017 --> 17:35.349
Get me search and rescue.
We got pilots down.

17:42.059 --> 17:43.822
Plane crashed 18 minutes ago.

17:43.861 --> 17:46.523
The White House chief of staff
is on his way up.

17:52.837 --> 17:56.534
Good morning, gentlemen.
So, do I wake the President?

17:57.375 --> 17:59.366
- Bill.
- Jack.

18:02.146 --> 18:04.614
Well, what have we got?

18:04.649 --> 18:06.480
We're going out with this.

18:07.318 --> 18:08.979
Rick's team prepared it.

18:11.155 --> 18:13.623
"The United States Air Force
regrets to announce...

18:13.658 --> 18:17.116
"that early this morning
a C141 heavy-lift cargo plane...

18:17.161 --> 18:18.958
"went down
over the Utah desert.

18:18.996 --> 18:21.624
"The status of the crew
has yet to be determined...

18:21.666 --> 18:23.327
Yadda yadda yadda. "

18:23.834 --> 18:25.597
That's very nice bullshit, Rick.

18:25.636 --> 18:27.501
- Thank you, sir.
- We'll go with that.

18:28.372 --> 18:29.339
Wait.

18:31.842 --> 18:33.400
We're making a mistake.

18:36.013 --> 18:37.981
Giles...

18:38.015 --> 18:40.882
You have some input
you wish to share with us?

18:41.519 --> 18:42.508
Yes, sir.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.154
"Aviation Week"
has been following...

18:50.194 --> 18:52.492
the development
of the B3 for years.

18:52.530 --> 18:55.829
They have guys camping out
in lawn chairs all night...

18:55.866 --> 18:57.663
out by the Whiteman
perimeter fence,

18:57.702 --> 19:00.603
watching just in case
one of these things take off.

19:00.638 --> 19:03.266
They're going to know
that one took off last night,

19:03.307 --> 19:06.936
and they're going to know...
that it didn't come back.

19:06.978 --> 19:08.605
We put out a press release...

19:08.646 --> 19:12.047
saying a C141 went down in Utah,
they'll put 2 and 2 together.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.948
"Aviation Week"
is going to run a story.

19:13.985 --> 19:15.953
Everyone's going to know
what really happened,

19:15.987 --> 19:19.718
and we're all going
to look extremely stupid.

19:21.659 --> 19:23.786
We're better off
just telling the truth.

19:23.828 --> 19:27.127
The truth?
How'd you get this job?

19:36.841 --> 19:40.004
- Rewrite it... like Giles said.
- Yes, sir.

19:40.678 --> 19:44.978
I want you to go to Utah.
I'll have my C21 standing by.

19:45.016 --> 19:49.350
That was good work in there.
"Guys in lawn chairs... "

19:49.854 --> 19:53.688
I don't know, Giles.
Sometimes you scare me.

19:54.358 --> 19:57.486
Hell, sir...
sometimes I scare myself.

20:01.198 --> 20:04.861
Move! Move! Move!
Come on!

20:12.810 --> 20:14.334
Wallace, over there!

20:14.378 --> 20:16.039
Reed, check over there!

20:16.080 --> 20:17.911
Kelly, check over there!

20:34.031 --> 20:36.761
- See anything?
- Not a goddamn thing!

20:37.902 --> 20:40.132
Colonel, this is Rhodes.

20:40.171 --> 20:41.365
Go, Max.

20:41.405 --> 20:44.533
Aircraft disintegrated.
Negative survivors on site.

20:44.575 --> 20:45.803
Checking payload. Over.

20:46.677 --> 20:48.508
You watch your needles
there, chief.

20:51.749 --> 20:52.977
Over here!

20:55.553 --> 20:57.316
Over here!

21:09.867 --> 21:11.357
Take that end.

21:27.384 --> 21:29.215
The nukes are gone.

21:39.163 --> 21:40.187
Colonel!

21:42.233 --> 21:43.894
We got ourselves
a Broken Arrow.

21:48.072 --> 21:49.903
You find those nukes, chief.

21:50.407 --> 21:51.874
If your Geigers
pick up more rads...

21:51.909 --> 21:54.309
than you get off a toaster,
I want you out of there.

21:57.014 --> 21:58.379
Broken what?

21:58.415 --> 22:03.148
Broken Arrow. It's a class IV
strategic theater emergency.

22:03.187 --> 22:06.213
It's what we call it
when we lose a nuclear weapon.

22:07.024 --> 22:10.653
I don't know what's scarier,
losing nuclear weapons...

22:10.694 --> 22:13.492
or that it happens so often,
there's a term for it.

22:13.531 --> 22:16.830
They've found the wreckage
90 miles outside of McMurren.

22:16.867 --> 22:18.698
No bombs on board.

22:19.703 --> 22:21.364
This is a real nightmare.

22:22.806 --> 22:24.967
We don't know where
the damn things are.

22:25.009 --> 22:27.170
Cappy, put 2 more teams
in the air.

22:27.211 --> 22:30.044
I want Chief Rhodes backed up
to the fullest extent.

22:36.387 --> 22:38.014
Why didn't they go off?

22:38.055 --> 22:40.023
They have to be armed
to detonate.

22:40.057 --> 22:42.855
They're designed
to survive crashes intact.

22:42.893 --> 22:45.020
They could lie in a 
pool of burning jet fuel...

22:45.062 --> 22:47.530
for 5 hours... no problem.

22:47.565 --> 22:48.896
So, what the hell happened?

22:49.400 --> 22:50.867
In his last transmission,

22:50.901 --> 22:53.495
Major Deakins said
that Captain Hale lost control.

22:53.537 --> 22:56.870
It's possible one of them
may have hit weapons release...

22:56.907 --> 22:58.431
during the confusion.

23:45.889 --> 23:47.049
Deakins.

24:01.338 --> 24:02.862
You won that round.

24:15.886 --> 24:18.514
Sir! Please turn around!

24:50.054 --> 24:52.887
- Who the hell are you?
- Park ranger.

24:56.160 --> 24:59.220
Just put it down,
and I won't have to kill you.

25:00.497 --> 25:03.159
This isn't a standoff.
I've got the gun.

25:05.169 --> 25:06.830
I never keep it loaded.

25:17.681 --> 25:19.376
Thought you said
it wasn't loaded.

25:20.517 --> 25:23.315
I lied.
Now, who the hell are you?

25:23.354 --> 25:25.618
I'm a captain
in the United States Air Force.

25:25.656 --> 25:29.649
Captain, you're under arrest
until we get this sorted out.

25:29.693 --> 25:31.786
Lady, you're missing
the bigger picture here.

25:31.829 --> 25:33.023
Uh!

25:35.866 --> 25:38.994
Hold still.
All right?

25:39.036 --> 25:41.334
I have already had
a hell of a morning, lady.

25:41.372 --> 25:43.169
I can't tell you
what's going on,

25:43.207 --> 25:45.175
but I need your help, OK?

25:45.209 --> 25:47.200
This is a good way
to convince me.

25:54.718 --> 25:56.515
We both know the gun is loaded.

25:56.553 --> 25:59.215
If I wanted to, I could blow
your head off, right?

26:01.492 --> 26:02.652
Yeah.

26:05.462 --> 26:07.157
But I'm not going to.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.126
Come on.

26:24.615 --> 26:26.583
I got a radio in my truck.

26:30.854 --> 26:32.185
It's this way.

26:49.873 --> 26:51.238
Got them!

27:14.832 --> 27:15.924
We got one.

27:42.693 --> 27:43.990
How you doing?

27:44.027 --> 27:47.292
Hey. You guys need
any help?

27:47.331 --> 27:49.231
It's an Air Force
training exercise, sir.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.464
I'll have to
ask you to leave.

27:52.503 --> 27:55.165
Hey, no problem.
We just, uh...

27:56.540 --> 27:58.030
Oh, jeez.

28:26.003 --> 28:27.834
Any sign of Deakins?

28:29.373 --> 28:31.170
Maybe the son of a bitch
is dead.

28:31.208 --> 28:33.676
What a terrible thing to say.

28:44.354 --> 28:45.651
Get them.

28:45.689 --> 28:48.658
You assured me
everything would go smoothly.

28:48.692 --> 28:50.660
Everything is going smoothly,
I assure you.

28:50.694 --> 28:53.857
Our merchandise is not
where it's supposed to be.

28:53.897 --> 28:55.888
It's right down there,
Mr. Pritchett.

28:57.034 --> 28:58.433
Everything's on schedule.

29:11.148 --> 29:15.448
Sir, we got one intact.
Let's go find the other one.

29:15.485 --> 29:17.753
Move! Let's go!

29:18.487 --> 29:20.284
Care for a Coke
or something?

29:20.322 --> 29:23.155
2 gunships left McMurren
and are headed this way.

29:23.191 --> 29:25.455
- Wonderful!
- Don't worry about them.

29:25.494 --> 29:28.122
I worry. What about
the other pilot?

29:28.163 --> 29:30.495
- We saw him eject.
- Huh.

29:31.666 --> 29:34.829
Captain Hale. I seriously doubt
that he's alive.

29:35.337 --> 29:38.135
I punched him out when we were
scraping the valley floor.

29:38.173 --> 29:40.698
There's a report
that a park ranger called in.

29:40.742 --> 29:43.142
- She saw a pilot come down.
- Really?

29:47.516 --> 29:48.574
Find her.

29:55.791 --> 29:57.281
I got it!

30:03.198 --> 30:04.893
Hello? McMmurren, come in.

30:04.933 --> 30:06.127
Go, Max.

30:06.701 --> 30:09.363
McMurren, come in. Over.

30:10.205 --> 30:11.570
Max, are you there?

30:11.606 --> 30:13.096
McMurren?

30:13.141 --> 30:14.073
Max.

30:15.110 --> 30:17.340
McMurren, come in.

30:41.303 --> 30:42.463
Move!

30:44.573 --> 30:46.302
Going to open the access panels.

30:47.075 --> 30:48.872
Going to drop in
a couple grenades.

30:48.910 --> 30:51.242
It won't go nuclear,
but it will destroy the bomb...

30:54.349 --> 30:56.340
And whoever's
trying to steal it.

30:57.085 --> 30:59.076
I can't let you do that, chief.

31:01.022 --> 31:02.512
And why not?

31:11.366 --> 31:12.663
All clear!

31:44.065 --> 31:47.057
- Where is your truck?
- Just around the bend.

31:48.069 --> 31:50.560
- How did you find me?
- Saw your chute.

31:51.573 --> 31:55.202
Don't step on that!
There. On that black stuff.

31:55.243 --> 31:57.837
It's cryptogammic soil.
Very fragile.

31:57.879 --> 32:01.246
One footprint takes
centuries to repair.

32:01.283 --> 32:04.150
Come on. Jump. Yeah.

32:04.185 --> 32:06.176
Thought it was a mine
or something.

32:07.689 --> 32:10.590
Endangered dirt.
That's a new one.

32:14.696 --> 32:18.598
Colonel Wilkins,
this is Airman Kelly, sir!

32:18.633 --> 32:21.295
- Go.
- Chief Rhodes is dead!

32:21.336 --> 32:22.769
They're all dead!

32:22.804 --> 32:26.035
What the hell happened?
What the hell happened?!

32:29.878 --> 32:33.712
It's the nuke!
It's open! It's wide open!

32:34.215 --> 32:36.547
Kelly, come in!
What happened?

32:39.220 --> 32:43.486
Oh, God! What am I going to do?

32:46.995 --> 32:48.826
Whoo!

32:50.899 --> 32:54.232
Recall search and rescue.
Get me Washington.

32:54.903 --> 32:57.030
I want N.E.S.T.
On this right now.

32:57.072 --> 33:00.473
- You missed your calling, boy.
- Yeah, Deak. I even bought it.

33:00.508 --> 33:02.476
Make sure you get Hale! Go!

33:02.510 --> 33:04.307
I'd like to remind you...

33:04.346 --> 33:07.315
there's two attack helicopters
headed this way.

33:07.349 --> 33:10.648
Not anymore.
They've just been recalled.

33:10.685 --> 33:12.152
I'll check the perimeter.

33:12.187 --> 33:13.984
That's where they're headed.
They're going over.

33:14.022 --> 33:15.512
Get to work.

33:21.863 --> 33:23.160
You see, Mr. Pritchett...

33:23.198 --> 33:25.860
they believe they've got
an exposed core...

33:26.701 --> 33:28.692
And that changes
things remarkably...

33:29.537 --> 33:31.334
Because you can't send
people out...

33:31.373 --> 33:34.001
to an active radiation area.
That wouldn't be right.

33:34.042 --> 33:37.011
First, you have to
take a picture from a satellite.

33:37.045 --> 33:39.673
That takes an hour and a half
to change orbit.

33:39.714 --> 33:41.443
Then they send in a N.E.S.T.

33:42.317 --> 33:44.547
That's a Nuclear
Emergency Search Team.

33:45.720 --> 33:48.188
Closest one is
about 2 hours from here.

33:48.223 --> 33:52.023
By the time they find us,
we'll be gone. So relax.

34:00.668 --> 34:02.795
Can your radio
get a signal to McMurren?

34:02.837 --> 34:04.464
I'll have Clyde
patch us through.

34:04.506 --> 34:08.340
We can get your people in here.
Then I can go feed my dog.

34:11.846 --> 34:14.178
Clyde, this is Terry.
Do you read me?

34:36.371 --> 34:39.534
Hello? Clyde, this is Terry.
Do you read me?

35:20.648 --> 35:22.513
Why the hell are they
shooting at us?

35:22.550 --> 35:24.518
We don't have time
to discuss it right now.

35:24.552 --> 35:26.019
Come on.

35:26.888 --> 35:28.480
Let's have some fun.

35:36.064 --> 35:37.531
Aah!

35:45.874 --> 35:48.138
- You OK?
- Yeah.

35:48.176 --> 35:49.200
Give me your gun.

35:56.050 --> 35:57.244
Come on.

36:14.002 --> 36:15.333
Come on.

36:21.676 --> 36:24.110
- You have any more bullets?
- Yeah.

36:27.849 --> 36:29.840
We need to get out
of this canyon.

36:30.852 --> 36:32.843
We can get out
up that way.

36:33.388 --> 36:36.482
Now, if I could get
that bastard to hold still.

36:36.524 --> 36:38.924
- I have an idea.
- Wait. I didn't mean...

36:53.875 --> 36:55.365
Oh, shit.

37:00.014 --> 37:02.039
Don't shoot!

37:03.017 --> 37:04.314
Where is he?

37:04.352 --> 37:05.944
I don't know.

37:28.610 --> 37:29.634
No.

37:45.126 --> 37:46.115
Go!

37:55.970 --> 37:57.699
Holy shit!

38:00.675 --> 38:02.643
Novacek must have hit
a canyon wall.

38:03.645 --> 38:05.909
- You think?
- Maybe.

38:05.947 --> 38:07.141
Maybe?

38:08.483 --> 38:10.815
You said you'd planned
this thing carefully.

38:11.419 --> 38:13.478
How are we going to move
those things now?

38:14.155 --> 38:15.952
Use the trucks.

38:15.990 --> 38:19.153
The trucks!
Now, you listen.

38:19.827 --> 38:22.796
I've spent a lot of money
underwriting this,

38:22.830 --> 38:26.664
and frankly, you're beginning
to shake my confidence!

38:33.341 --> 38:36.640
Well... yeah.
Well, I, uh...

38:36.678 --> 38:39.476
I do appreciate the money
that you and your associates...

38:39.514 --> 38:42.642
have invested
in this operation, but, uh...

38:42.684 --> 38:45.653
it is an operation.
It's a military operation,

38:45.687 --> 38:47.552
and you don't know dick
about that.

38:47.588 --> 38:49.886
I have been in the military
for 20 years.

38:49.924 --> 38:52.859
I planned and flew
over 100 missions in the Gulf.

38:53.361 --> 38:55.659
I put these boys together
because they are motivated...

38:55.697 --> 38:57.631
and they are
highly trained, like me.

38:57.665 --> 39:00.429
This is what I do,
and this is battle,

39:00.468 --> 39:03.767
and battle is a highly
fluid situation.

39:03.805 --> 39:06.603
You plan on your contingencies,
and I have.

39:06.641 --> 39:08.438
You keep your initiative,
and I will.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.706
But what you don't do
is share command.

39:10.745 --> 39:12.303
It's never a good idea.

39:12.980 --> 39:14.811
It's still my money.

39:18.353 --> 39:19.684
And if we succeed,

39:19.721 --> 39:21.655
you and your friends
will get a ton of it.

39:21.689 --> 39:23.088
If we're successful?

39:23.124 --> 39:24.455
Look, Mr. Pritchett,

39:24.492 --> 39:27.620
I will deliver the weapons
to the destination,

39:27.662 --> 39:30.631
but I can't depend
and I can't guarantee...

39:30.665 --> 39:32.132
that those assholes
in Washington...

39:32.166 --> 39:34.794
won't do something stupid
like not pay.

39:35.336 --> 39:36.826
What if they don't?

39:37.338 --> 39:39.499
Well, if they don't...

39:40.508 --> 39:42.476
The Southwest will be
a quiet neighborhood

39:42.510 --> 39:44.842
for about 10,000 years.

39:53.588 --> 39:54.555
Wilkins.

39:54.589 --> 39:57.786
Fax me their last transmission.
How much radiation is tracking?

39:59.694 --> 40:01.491
- Fax that to Mr. Prentice.
- Yes, sir.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.360
So far, we're not
picking up any.

40:03.398 --> 40:05.195
That's kind
of strange, isn't it?

40:06.200 --> 40:08.532
I mean, with an exposed core?

40:08.569 --> 40:11.561
The breach may not be
as bad as we thought.

40:27.555 --> 40:30.718
Colonel... what if this
wasn't an accident?

40:32.393 --> 40:33.860
What are you saying, Giles?

40:33.895 --> 40:35.863
In his final transmission
before the crash,

40:35.897 --> 40:38.331
Major Deakins said
Captain Hale lost it.

40:38.366 --> 40:40.527
We all assume that
to mean pilot error...

40:40.568 --> 40:44.971
or equipment failure,
but what if he meant...

40:45.006 --> 40:47.531
Hale intentionally
lost the plane?

40:47.575 --> 40:49.839
But why would he do that?

40:49.877 --> 40:52.402
Two nuclear weapons
would be worth a lot of money.

40:52.447 --> 40:56.213
To who, son? There are easier
ways to buy nuclear weapons.

40:56.250 --> 40:58.218
Go to one of the old
Soviet republics,

40:58.252 --> 41:01.153
they'll fix you up with a couple
for the price of a BMW.

41:01.189 --> 41:06.183
Sir... I meant, how much
would they be worth to us?

41:06.227 --> 41:08.252
How much would we pay
to get them back?

41:08.296 --> 41:09.695
Hold on.

41:12.867 --> 41:16.166
These nukes have codes that
prevent people from using them.

41:16.204 --> 41:17.671
Of course.

41:17.705 --> 41:19.673
And no one knows
these codes, right,

41:19.707 --> 41:21.675
except for the President
and you guys?

41:21.709 --> 41:24.337
Access to the codes
requires the highest security.

41:24.378 --> 41:27.211
Not even the pilots
have these codes, right?

41:27.882 --> 41:29.509
Where is that N.E.S.T. Team now?

41:30.117 --> 41:31.516
They just took off, sir.

41:31.552 --> 41:33.884
The E.T.A. In Utah
is 96 minutes.

41:40.061 --> 41:42.552
- Correct 10, left.
- 10-4.

41:54.075 --> 41:56.771
- It's OK.
- It's not OK!

41:56.811 --> 42:00.508
I want to know
what's going on right now!

42:09.857 --> 42:13.020
We were carrying nuclear weapons
on our plane last night.

42:16.364 --> 42:18.798
My former commander
is trying to steal them.

42:21.536 --> 42:24.528
- Oh, my God.
- That's why I need your help.

42:25.706 --> 42:29.164
Without the helicopter,
he won't be able to move them.

42:29.210 --> 42:32.873
Deak will have a backup plan.
He'll be prepared for that.

42:36.551 --> 42:39.042
Trucks. He's got trucks.

42:39.720 --> 42:42.018
Last night Clyde radioed me...

42:42.056 --> 42:45.219
that someone came through
the Needles gate with trucks.

42:46.060 --> 42:49.052
He won't take them towards town.
What else is around here?

42:52.233 --> 42:53.757
The river.

43:04.512 --> 43:06.002
Do you mind?

43:06.847 --> 43:08.508
No, I don't mind at all.

43:10.685 --> 43:12.175
Care for one?

43:32.807 --> 43:35.901
- The one in front has the nukes.
- How do you know?

43:35.943 --> 43:38.377
There's only a driver.
They're keeping the weight down.

43:39.046 --> 43:41.879
- Give me your gun again.
- What are you going to do?

43:44.385 --> 43:46.012
I'll think of something.

43:46.053 --> 43:48.990
Wait. We know where they are.

43:49.123 --> 43:50.522
Let's get to a phone
and call for help.

43:50.558 --> 43:52.526
If they make it to the river,
I'll lose them again.

43:52.560 --> 43:54.221
You get to the phone, OK?

43:55.463 --> 43:58.193
- Then I'm going with you.
- No, you're not.

43:58.232 --> 43:59.859
You're going to need help.

43:59.900 --> 44:02.300
I don't have time
to argue with you, OK?

44:02.336 --> 44:04.463
The nuclear weapons are
my responsibility, not yours.

44:04.505 --> 44:06.803
You're a park ranger.
I'm a military officer.

44:06.841 --> 44:08.206
Just go to the phone.

44:24.358 --> 44:26.849
This is a bad idea.

44:35.603 --> 44:36.695
Hi.

44:37.304 --> 44:38.293
Hi.

44:40.941 --> 44:42.169
Hale! Well, goddamn!

45:00.795 --> 45:01.784
Run him down.

45:03.330 --> 45:04.854
Get him!

45:08.702 --> 45:09.794
Get him!

45:20.181 --> 45:21.170
Fuck!

45:24.685 --> 45:27.279
Don't panic.
Bulletproof glass.

45:29.690 --> 45:30.952
You can get out now.

45:32.259 --> 45:34.454
Looks like we got ourselves
a standoff.

45:35.896 --> 45:38.626
- Aah!
- No... we... don't!

45:45.506 --> 45:46.871
Go! Go!

45:52.046 --> 45:53.946
OK... you can come.

46:00.888 --> 46:01.877
Stay down!

46:04.325 --> 46:08.762
Would you mind not shooting
at the thermonuclear weapons?

46:18.172 --> 46:20.333
Where's St. Jude's
hospital from here?

46:21.008 --> 46:22.703
Salt Lake City, I think.

46:32.686 --> 46:34.779
- Shit!
- What?

46:34.822 --> 46:36.187
We're losing gas.

46:36.690 --> 46:38.317
They must have hit the tank.

46:38.359 --> 46:40.691
We need someplace
to hide these things.

46:41.428 --> 46:42.861
I know a place.

46:49.503 --> 46:50.697
Uh!

47:01.315 --> 47:03.306
What the fuck
are you up to, Hale?

47:13.360 --> 47:14.520
Don't even.

47:20.401 --> 47:21.390
Stop!

47:27.408 --> 47:28.841
Aw, fuck!

47:35.683 --> 47:37.514
You learn that
in survival school?

47:38.185 --> 47:42.019
New Jersey.
Trenton, New Jersey.

48:14.154 --> 48:15.644
What is this place?

48:16.991 --> 48:18.458
It used to be a copper mine.

48:18.492 --> 48:20.653
They shut it down
a couple years ago.

48:23.097 --> 48:25.156
Why would they have a new lock?

48:31.505 --> 48:32.995
All right.

48:35.843 --> 48:38.835
Good move, Hale.
I didn't see it coming...

48:40.681 --> 48:43.673
But you're going to pay for it.
Saddle up, boys.

49:19.153 --> 49:22.645
This place has been prepped.
Deak's been here.

49:24.491 --> 49:26.789
What? You think
he's coming back?

49:26.827 --> 49:30.160
That would be my guess.
May not have a lot of time.

49:31.165 --> 49:32.757
What are we going to do?

49:39.673 --> 49:42.164
We'll just take away
his reason for being here.

49:43.177 --> 49:45.168
Want to help me
unload these things?

49:52.519 --> 49:54.146
Where do you think
they're going?

49:54.188 --> 49:56.850
Same place we were...
the only thing on this road.

50:08.469 --> 50:09.834
My God.

50:16.543 --> 50:18.374
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

50:19.046 --> 50:20.673
When you fly
with nuclear weapons,

50:20.714 --> 50:22.682
you're trained
to retrieve if possible,

50:22.716 --> 50:26.083
disable if necessary,
and destroy if essential.

50:26.120 --> 50:27.678
And what are we doing?

50:30.557 --> 50:31.922
I'm going to disable it.

50:33.560 --> 50:35.858
You have to arm
these things with a code.

50:35.896 --> 50:39.059
If you enter the wrong code
3 times, the nuke goes dead.

50:39.099 --> 50:41.727
All the circuitry
shuts down and shorts out.

50:42.970 --> 50:44.938
Pretty soon
these things will be...

50:44.972 --> 50:46.906
nothing more
than paperweights.

50:54.249 --> 50:55.648
Hale, pick up.

50:56.451 --> 50:57.975
Pick up!

50:58.753 --> 51:01.984
Come on, buddy.
Pick up the phone.

51:02.023 --> 51:04.617
Buddy, huh?
Son of a bitch.

51:04.659 --> 51:07.594
You tried to kill me.
The friendship is over.

51:07.629 --> 51:09.654
That doesn't mean
I don't like you.

51:09.698 --> 51:11.325
Hell, I'm impressed.

51:11.366 --> 51:14.699
I figured you'd have packed up
and walked off by now.

51:14.736 --> 51:17.398
You figured wrong.
Now I got the nukes.

51:17.439 --> 51:20.237
Guess what, Deak.
I'm going to deactivate them.

51:21.810 --> 51:22.868
You hear that?

51:22.911 --> 51:24.435
That's me punching
the wrong codes.

51:24.479 --> 51:27.141
Pretty soon these things
will be absolutely useless.

51:27.182 --> 51:29.150
Might as well turn around
and drive away.

51:29.184 --> 51:32.244
Outstanding, Hale.
That's the spirit.

51:32.287 --> 51:34.414
Damn. I'm totally screwed now.

51:35.924 --> 51:38.392
Unless I thought of that
ahead of time.

51:43.765 --> 51:45.027
What?

51:46.301 --> 51:47.598
You're kidding.

51:49.204 --> 51:53.641
Didn't work, did it?
I used uncoded circuit boards.

51:53.675 --> 51:57.941
You just activated
a nuclear warhead, my friend.

51:57.979 --> 52:01.142
Setting off a nuke in this mine
has been my plan from day one.

52:01.182 --> 52:02.706
Otherwise, some D.C. Civilian...

52:02.751 --> 52:05.185
might say
I haven't got the guts.

52:07.589 --> 52:08.954
Fuck!

52:11.192 --> 52:13.126
He's insane.

52:13.161 --> 52:17.120
I considered bringing you in.
You know why I didn't?

52:17.165 --> 52:20.931
- Because I would have said no?
- Nah. I'd have just killed you.

52:20.969 --> 52:23.767
I was afraid you'd say yes...

52:23.805 --> 52:26.467
because you don't have the balls
to go through with this.

52:26.508 --> 52:27.941
We both know that.

52:31.246 --> 52:33.271
How deep is this mine?

52:33.315 --> 52:36.045
Uh... about 2,000 feet.

52:38.153 --> 52:39.347
That's plenty.

52:39.387 --> 52:41.787
I'm going to be there
in a few minutes.

52:41.823 --> 52:43.791
Get out of there
as soon as you can.

52:43.825 --> 52:45.816
It's your last move, buddy.

52:45.860 --> 52:48.260
I can think of another move.

52:48.296 --> 52:51.129
I'll keep these together.
If one goes off,

52:51.166 --> 52:54.101
the other gets buried
under a billion tons of rock.

52:54.135 --> 52:56.660
How does that sound?

52:56.705 --> 52:58.900
You wouldn't
do something like that.

52:58.940 --> 53:01.636
You sure about that... buddy?

53:02.577 --> 53:05.011
Shit! Fuck!
He's going to do it.

53:05.046 --> 53:06.104
Let's get him.

53:06.147 --> 53:08.843
We've got to be gone
before he gets here.

53:17.092 --> 53:19.219
I can't do this.

53:19.260 --> 53:22.229
Listen, you told me
this is a copper mine, right?

53:22.263 --> 53:23.890
- Right?
- Right.

53:23.932 --> 53:28.198
The blast will fuse this place
into one big solid copper pot.

53:28.236 --> 53:30.670
- But they're coming!
- That's right.

53:30.705 --> 53:33.833
If I don't get these to a safe
level before they get here,

53:33.875 --> 53:35.843
God knows where he'll use them.

53:47.288 --> 53:49.279
Just keep an eye
on the timer, OK?

54:04.906 --> 54:06.203
All right.

54:52.320 --> 54:53.912
What is that noise?

54:55.990 --> 54:59.448
Water. There's an underground
river beneath this place.

54:59.494 --> 55:01.485
Let's get these things unloaded.

55:29.991 --> 55:31.788
I understand, sir.

55:31.826 --> 55:33.987
I'll advise N.E.S.T.
Of the situation.

55:34.028 --> 55:37.225
As soon as the ground is clean,
I'll send in a dozen gunships.

55:37.265 --> 55:39.233
We'll secure the whole area.

55:39.267 --> 55:40.757
Yes, sir.

55:44.138 --> 55:46.470
- Giles Prentice, sir.
- Wilkins.

55:46.508 --> 55:49.033
- Good to meet you finally.
- Likewise, sir.

55:49.077 --> 55:51.568
That was the chairman,
Mr. Prentice.

55:51.613 --> 55:54.980
According to an N.S.A.
Radio intercept, you were right,

55:55.016 --> 55:58.577
but it's Deakins
stealing the nukes, not Hale.

56:16.838 --> 56:18.465
Now what?

56:18.506 --> 56:20.701
We get out of here
before he shows up.

56:39.594 --> 56:41.494
How many times
do I have to say it?

56:41.529 --> 56:44.293
Please don't shoot
the nuclear weapons.

57:28.242 --> 57:30.710
Kelly, we found the nuke.

57:30.745 --> 57:32.872
We're at the end of tunnel "A."

57:32.914 --> 57:35.405
Put the cold one on the
elevator, and we'll be along.

57:43.558 --> 57:45.287
A service tunnel.
Come on.

57:47.829 --> 57:50.229
Make sure Hale
doesn't get back to the bomb.

57:50.264 --> 57:53.256
And, Johnson,
the clock is ticking.

58:19.861 --> 58:22.830
- Where are you taking us?
- Back to the elevator.

58:22.864 --> 58:25.765
These service tunnels
run between the main shafts.

58:25.800 --> 58:28.428
Now... if we take
the next right...

58:29.404 --> 58:30.564
Aah!

58:43.317 --> 58:46.252
Hey, Hale.
Nice move with the nukes.

58:46.287 --> 58:49.984
Shows initiative, determination.
Proud of you!

58:51.426 --> 58:53.417
But I think I gave us
too much time.

58:53.461 --> 58:55.895
30 whole minutes...
I don't know.

58:55.930 --> 58:58.694
Shows a lack of total
commitment, don't you think?

58:58.733 --> 59:00.598
So I took it down to 13.

59:04.939 --> 59:06.338
I'll be right back.

01:00:03.131 --> 01:00:04.120
Bitch!

01:00:25.319 --> 01:00:27.810
- All set.
- We'll be right along.

01:01:24.345 --> 01:01:26.040
Are you OK?

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:45.390
Well, I got to go.

01:01:45.433 --> 01:01:47.799
You two have a nice time
down here.

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:53.071
And don't forget to say hi
to Johnson for me...

01:01:53.107 --> 01:01:54.938
when you see him.

01:01:54.976 --> 01:01:57.467
20 bucks says
you're going to see him first.

01:01:58.713 --> 01:02:00.840
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:03.908
You're going to ransom
Salt Lake City, aren't you?

01:02:03.951 --> 01:02:05.680
Why do you say that?

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.210
St. Jude's hospital.

01:02:07.255 --> 01:02:09.655
You'll hide the warheads
in radiology...

01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:12.386
so they don't show up
on satellite scans, right?

01:02:12.426 --> 01:02:14.394
Huh. Well, I'm impressed.

01:02:15.096 --> 01:02:18.588
Thank you.
So, how much you ask for?

01:02:18.633 --> 01:02:21.101
Lots. I got a broker
in Stockholm...

01:02:21.135 --> 01:02:23.831
that's going to buy me
5% of Volvo.

01:02:23.871 --> 01:02:26.840
For the rest of my years,
I'll live off the dividends,

01:02:26.874 --> 01:02:29.900
happy in the knowledge
that I'm helping to make...

01:02:29.944 --> 01:02:33.436
the safest automobiles
in the world.

01:02:33.481 --> 01:02:36.575
So that's what this
is all about? Money?

01:02:36.617 --> 01:02:39.211
- Yeah.
- Bullshit.

01:02:39.253 --> 01:02:41.380
You tell me why.
Go ahead.

01:02:43.124 --> 01:02:44.785
You tell me why.

01:02:44.825 --> 01:02:47.487
Because you've been passed over
for promotion so many times,

01:02:47.528 --> 01:02:49.758
you want to show the bastards
you're right.

01:02:49.797 --> 01:02:52.732
Maybe it's because
everybody's cashing out,

01:02:52.767 --> 01:02:54.359
so why the hell not you?

01:02:54.402 --> 01:02:58.031
Maybe your mother dropped you on
your head when you were a baby.

01:02:58.072 --> 01:02:59.505
Who the hell cares?

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:01.201
There's no difference
between you...

01:03:01.242 --> 01:03:03.301
and a guy who
shoots up a schoolyard.

01:03:03.344 --> 01:03:06.575
You both got a head
full of bad wiring.

01:03:06.614 --> 01:03:09.242
- What was that?
- You're fucked in the head!

01:03:11.585 --> 01:03:12.574
Ha!

01:03:13.821 --> 01:03:15.379
I pissed him off.

01:03:26.367 --> 01:03:28.460
Uh, uh... it's this way.

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.816
Hey, hey, hey!
Where the hell's the other one?

01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:43.976
Shut up.

01:03:51.892 --> 01:03:53.257
Help us. Come on.

01:04:09.076 --> 01:04:10.941
Aah...

01:04:10.978 --> 01:04:13.503
What a Mongolian clusterfuck.

01:04:13.547 --> 01:04:16.015
Get the goddamn thing in.
Let's get out of here.

01:04:18.886 --> 01:04:20.854
That was the only way out.

01:04:23.424 --> 01:04:24.755
Oh, man.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.253
That's it, then, isn't it?

01:04:47.281 --> 01:04:48.805
You have any family?

01:04:51.752 --> 01:04:54.016
No. Just me and Fred.

01:04:55.623 --> 01:04:59.252
Fred. Uh, who's Fred?
Your boyfriend?

01:04:59.293 --> 01:05:00.692
No. My dog.

01:05:04.698 --> 01:05:05.995
The river.

01:05:06.033 --> 01:05:08.365
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:05:08.402 --> 01:05:12.771
They hit it digging a tunnel.

01:05:12.807 --> 01:05:14.900
That's why they shut down
the mine.

01:05:15.743 --> 01:05:17.176
Come on.

01:05:37.965 --> 01:05:40.092
Hang on.
Four minutes to detonation.

01:05:40.801 --> 01:05:43.668
You stupid bastard!
We'll all be killed!

01:05:43.704 --> 01:05:45.137
We'll be fine, Mr. Pritchett.

01:05:45.172 --> 01:05:48.767
Please keep your voice down.
I'm trying to concentrate.

01:05:53.446 --> 01:05:54.811
This should be it.

01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:19.700
That seam doesn't go anywhere.

01:06:19.739 --> 01:06:21.229
Oh...

01:06:31.284 --> 01:06:32.842
One o'clock. On the road.

01:06:51.938 --> 01:06:54.236
Attention.
We are federal agents.

01:06:54.273 --> 01:06:56.741
Stop your vehicle immediately.

01:06:56.776 --> 01:06:59.404
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:06:59.445 --> 01:07:03.006
How does that gunship
fit into your grand strategy?

01:07:03.049 --> 01:07:05.108
You don't know
what you're doing!

01:07:05.151 --> 01:07:08.177
This is out of control!
I must have been...

01:07:11.691 --> 01:07:13.784
Hush. Hush.

01:07:13.826 --> 01:07:15.691
Stop your vehicle.

01:07:15.728 --> 01:07:18.253
I repeat,
stop your vehicle immediately.

01:07:29.008 --> 01:07:30.475
We'll get in front of him.

01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:40.110
Do not move,
or you will be fired upon.

01:07:41.354 --> 01:07:43.015
Ah-ah!

01:07:43.056 --> 01:07:44.614
We are federal agents.

01:07:44.657 --> 01:07:48.218
Throw down your weapons
and keep your hands in sight.

01:08:11.717 --> 01:08:13.275
I just realized something.

01:08:13.319 --> 01:08:15.549
I never actually
killed anyone before.

01:08:15.588 --> 01:08:19.524
I mean... I dropped
bombs on Baghdad,

01:08:19.559 --> 01:08:22.118
but never face-to-face.

01:08:23.729 --> 01:08:25.697
I don't know
what the big deal is.

01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:26.890
I really don't.

01:08:30.603 --> 01:08:33.265
Turn your electronic equipment
off now.

01:08:33.305 --> 01:08:34.705
Throw down your weapons.

01:09:18.484 --> 01:09:21.510
- We're losing power!
- Oh, my God!

01:09:28.027 --> 01:09:30.086
Control, people. Control.

01:09:31.296 --> 01:09:33.197
We've gone red!
Trip the relays!

01:09:37.136 --> 01:09:38.796
Aah...

01:09:48.514 --> 01:09:50.413
I said, goddamn,
what a rush!

01:09:54.252 --> 01:09:55.277
Whoo!

01:09:55.321 --> 01:09:56.913
Son of a bitch!

01:09:56.956 --> 01:09:59.049
Shock wave took down
the damn chopper.

01:09:59.091 --> 01:10:01.491
That's E.M.P...
electromagnetic pulse.

01:10:01.527 --> 01:10:03.495
Nuclear blast
sends it out for miles.

01:10:03.529 --> 01:10:05.292
Everything electronic
shuts down,

01:10:05.331 --> 01:10:07.561
including choppers
and radios.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.660
Hell, we just shut down
McMurren's field communications.

01:10:10.703 --> 01:10:13.501
That will put a dent
in their response time, huh?

01:10:13.539 --> 01:10:16.702
- Deak, you the man!
- I'm the man!

01:10:16.742 --> 01:10:19.438
Shouldn't we be evacuating?

01:10:19.478 --> 01:10:21.241
We're fine. It was underground.

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.009
Colonel Wilkins
to General Creely.

01:10:23.049 --> 01:10:24.676
How do you know?

01:10:24.717 --> 01:10:26.708
If it had been
a surface detonation,

01:10:26.752 --> 01:10:28.947
we'd have felt a different kind
of ground tremor.

01:10:28.988 --> 01:10:31.115
We'd also be burned,
blind, and dying.

01:10:35.294 --> 01:10:36.488
We're 10 minutes behind.

01:10:36.529 --> 01:10:39.692
Mr. Pritchett, would you mind
stepping outside?

01:10:51.844 --> 01:10:53.641
It went off underground,
thank God.

01:10:53.679 --> 01:10:54.976
What do we do now?

01:10:55.948 --> 01:10:59.475
First, we nail a huge
goddamn lid on this thing.

01:10:59.518 --> 01:11:01.748
And with all due respect
to your boy Giles...

01:11:01.787 --> 01:11:05.655
and his belief that honesty
is the best policy,

01:11:05.691 --> 01:11:08.353
from now until
the end of the world,

01:11:08.394 --> 01:11:12.228
what happened in Utah today
was an earthquake.

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.964
Hey, it's OK.

01:11:50.002 --> 01:11:51.902
My God.
We set off a nuclear bomb.

01:11:51.937 --> 01:11:53.461
The walls shielded the blast.

01:11:53.506 --> 01:11:55.440
None of the radiation
leaked out.

01:11:55.474 --> 01:11:57.465
- We're all right.
- Look at my hands.

01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:00.638
- Why are they shaking like that?
- Because the water was freezing.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:03.478
- That's not normal.
- No, it's OK.

01:12:03.516 --> 01:12:07.008
We're just cold.
Just need to get warm.

01:12:07.053 --> 01:12:08.953
OK? All right?

01:12:13.225 --> 01:12:16.126
Hey, look.
See the butterflies there?

01:12:16.162 --> 01:12:18.426
If there was radiation,
they wouldn't survive.

01:12:18.464 --> 01:12:21.160
Now, would they? No.

01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:26.235
All right?

01:12:26.272 --> 01:12:27.933
I guess not.

01:12:31.477 --> 01:12:34.446
It says so
in the detonation manual,

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.540
that if you see butterflies
after detonation,

01:12:37.583 --> 01:12:40.381
you're going to be fine. OK?

01:12:43.823 --> 01:12:45.347
It doesn't say that.

01:12:46.659 --> 01:12:48.559
I promise you, though,
we're fine.

01:12:54.533 --> 01:12:57.195
How far downriver
does this path go?

01:12:57.236 --> 01:12:59.033
Three or four miles.

01:12:59.071 --> 01:13:02.063
We should get to Deakins
before he gets out of here.

01:13:17.456 --> 01:13:18.445
Wait.

01:13:24.697 --> 01:13:26.688
Looks like there's
just two of them.

01:13:29.635 --> 01:13:30.932
There's more coming.

01:13:40.212 --> 01:13:43.875
I thought you said Hale
wouldn't be a problem.

01:13:43.916 --> 01:13:47.010
He surprised me, too,
but he's dead, so let's go.

01:14:39.839 --> 01:14:42.205
- Sink it?
- Steal it.

01:14:55.955 --> 01:14:57.889
- Let's move it.
- They're coming.

01:14:57.923 --> 01:15:00.824
Get out of the boat.
Get out of the boat!

01:15:31.824 --> 01:15:33.792
Well, your friends
in Washington...

01:15:33.826 --> 01:15:36.124
should be getting
the package now.

01:15:36.161 --> 01:15:40.825
Yep. I'm sure we got their full
and complete attention.

01:15:40.866 --> 01:15:43.596
Let's move it.
We're on a tight schedule.

01:16:19.404 --> 01:16:22.635
...$250 million by 1400,
Utah time.

01:16:22.674 --> 01:16:26.235
This deadline is not negotiable,
and there is no grace period.

01:16:26.278 --> 01:16:28.041
The second device is on a timer.

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.571
Shortly after you receive this,
the timer will be activated.

01:16:30.616 --> 01:16:32.982
At 1401, I will make a call.

01:16:33.018 --> 01:16:35.452
If you have complied,
I will stop the timer.

01:16:35.487 --> 01:16:37.352
If you have not...

01:17:05.951 --> 01:17:07.919
Yes. Yes, sir. I understand.

01:17:10.322 --> 01:17:12.381
- Creely.
- Please hold.

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:17.356
The President is asking if we
know where the device is headed.

01:17:17.396 --> 01:17:20.092
If Deakins had a plane waiting,
it could be anywhere.

01:17:20.132 --> 01:17:22.259
- We just don't know.
- I do.

01:17:23.402 --> 01:17:24.630
One moment, sir.

01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:27.036
This is Colonel Jamison.
They've found Captain Hale.

01:17:27.072 --> 01:17:28.903
He's at Lake Powell.

01:17:47.793 --> 01:17:49.727
This is a really bad idea.

01:18:26.498 --> 01:18:28.966
- Sir, the prisoner is secure.
- All right, Tom. Good job.

01:18:29.001 --> 01:18:31.060
You gentlemen can R.T.B.
I'll take it.

01:18:31.103 --> 01:18:32.900
Roger, sir. Returning to base.

01:18:33.905 --> 01:18:36.430
They found the raft
on the other side of the lake.

01:18:36.475 --> 01:18:40.070
Tracks from a heavy truck
ran out on the paved road.

01:18:42.014 --> 01:18:43.914
- What about the girl?
- What about her?

01:18:44.716 --> 01:18:47.207
What about her?
She's an innocent victim.

01:18:47.252 --> 01:18:48.685
I got her involved.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:51.484
You're going to hit that truck
with everything you've got.

01:18:51.523 --> 01:18:53.650
I don't want her
becoming a casualty.

01:18:53.692 --> 01:18:55.455
Maybe giving her up
is OK with you,

01:18:55.494 --> 01:18:57.052
but we're military officers.

01:18:57.095 --> 01:19:00.531
We took an oath,
one officer to another.

01:19:00.565 --> 01:19:02.760
We have a responsibility
to save that woman's life...

01:19:02.801 --> 01:19:04.291
and get back the weapon.

01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:07.470
I have a responsibility
to follow orders...

01:19:07.506 --> 01:19:08.768
and return you to McMurren.

01:19:08.807 --> 01:19:11.275
Do you understand
what orders are, captain?

01:19:11.309 --> 01:19:14.403
- Yes, sir, I do.
- Good.

01:19:20.619 --> 01:19:22.314
Because I'm about to break them.

01:19:26.491 --> 01:19:29.756
- Any argument, Mr. Prentice?
- No, sir.

01:19:31.596 --> 01:19:34.588
Just for the record,
I'm not entirely a civilian.

01:19:34.633 --> 01:19:39.093
I was actually a lieutenant
in the R.O.T.C. At Yale.

01:19:42.607 --> 01:19:44.165
Good for you, lieutenant.

01:19:48.747 --> 01:19:50.874
- Is the radio still down?
- Afraid so.

01:19:50.916 --> 01:19:53.282
Your chopper will be
refueled in two minutes.

01:19:54.219 --> 01:19:56.050
I wish I were going with you.

01:19:56.088 --> 01:19:58.852
Captain, what exactly
are you looking for?

01:19:58.890 --> 01:20:01.654
- Tracks.
- As in railroad tracks?

01:20:01.693 --> 01:20:04.184
Yeah. Deak knows you're covering
every inch of asphalt.

01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:06.754
I'll bet 20 bucks
that nuke isn't on a truck.

01:20:06.798 --> 01:20:10.325
- It's on a train.
- Let me see the map.

01:20:10.368 --> 01:20:12.097
Salt Lake is northwest of here.

01:20:12.137 --> 01:20:13.832
These tracks curve east
before Salt Lake.

01:20:13.872 --> 01:20:15.237
Why would he do that?

01:20:15.273 --> 01:20:17.104
I don't think he's going
to Salt Lake.

01:20:19.478 --> 01:20:21.173
But that's where
the closest hospital is.

01:20:21.213 --> 01:20:22.942
You found the radiology tag.

01:20:22.981 --> 01:20:25.211
That's what's bothering me.
I think he planted it...

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:28.378
to make the person that found it
think that's where he's heading.

01:20:29.754 --> 01:20:32.279
- He's doing a rope-a-dope.
- He's doing a what?

01:20:33.024 --> 01:20:37.120
Rope-a-dope. It's a boxing term.
Ali and Foreman in Zaire.

01:20:37.162 --> 01:20:39.289
I know what the rope-a-dope is.
What's your point?

01:20:39.331 --> 01:20:42.823
My point is that everything he
shows us says he's heading west.

01:20:42.868 --> 01:20:44.460
He's actually heading east.

01:20:46.338 --> 01:20:47.396
Denver.

01:20:49.708 --> 01:20:52.700
You said you had Salt Lake
sealed up pretty tight.

01:20:52.744 --> 01:20:55.304
What's it going to hurt
if we check out Denver?

01:21:14.266 --> 01:21:17.394
Shepherd!
Any trouble with the train crew?

01:21:17.435 --> 01:21:19.403
Not a bit.
They went like lambs.

01:21:19.437 --> 01:21:22.565
Good for them. Let's get
that satellite dish wired in.

01:21:22.607 --> 01:21:24.666
- Already done.
- Excellent.

01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:27.837
With this remote, you can shut
the bomb down face-to-face...

01:21:27.879 --> 01:21:30.211
or dial it in over the link.

01:21:30.248 --> 01:21:32.079
All right.
Let's close this deal.

01:21:32.117 --> 01:21:34.085
I want to be airborne
in five minutes...

01:21:34.119 --> 01:21:35.814
en route to the mountains.

01:21:35.854 --> 01:21:38.550
Contact Washington. Tell them
the bomb's on its way to Denver.

01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:39.921
Then contact Geneva.

01:21:39.958 --> 01:21:42.620
When the money's in place,
I'll shut down that puppy.

01:21:43.762 --> 01:21:45.923
Smile, boys.
We're about to retire.

01:21:45.964 --> 01:21:48.057
Let's get this bird unwrapped.

01:22:20.198 --> 01:22:21.222
Uhh!

01:22:23.168 --> 01:22:25.102
We haven't met.
I'm Max.

01:22:30.942 --> 01:22:32.273
Uhh!

01:22:34.846 --> 01:22:37.474
You probably thought
I was a computer nerd.

01:22:37.515 --> 01:22:39.847
Ha ha ha! Wrong.

01:22:39.884 --> 01:22:41.715
I was a Navy S.E.A.L., lady.

01:22:41.753 --> 01:22:45.245
You should see what I can do
with just my thumb.

01:23:39.844 --> 01:23:43.302
You just saved me $3 million.
I owe you one.

01:23:43.348 --> 01:23:45.145
Shoot yourself.
We'll call it square.

01:23:45.183 --> 01:23:46.946
Whoa. Attitude.

01:23:50.455 --> 01:23:52.980
Now, where's
my little buddy Hale?

01:23:53.825 --> 01:23:55.224
He left you alone, didn't he?

01:23:55.794 --> 01:23:59.059
Oh, that's his speed...
100% pussy.

01:23:59.931 --> 01:24:01.990
He's got more guts
than you think.

01:24:05.236 --> 01:24:07.704
But would he have enough guts
to eat a bullet...

01:24:07.739 --> 01:24:10.367
before he'd help someone
vaporize a whole city?

01:24:10.408 --> 01:24:13.775
I think he'd fold, but not you.

01:24:13.812 --> 01:24:16.178
I think you've got
more guts than he does.

01:24:16.214 --> 01:24:18.910
I think you'd eat a bullet.

01:24:24.356 --> 01:24:25.618
Let's find out.

01:24:28.693 --> 01:24:30.092
Now, press four.

01:24:31.062 --> 01:24:32.154
Ooh.

01:24:37.268 --> 01:24:39.498
Ahh, I said push four.

01:24:43.274 --> 01:24:44.741
Go ahead.

01:24:44.776 --> 01:24:46.209
Push four.

01:24:52.384 --> 01:24:53.817
Ahh.

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.144
Four.

01:24:58.423 --> 01:24:59.583
Eight.

01:25:02.894 --> 01:25:03.986
Seven.

01:25:06.131 --> 01:25:07.098
Go ahead.

01:25:07.132 --> 01:25:08.099
Please.

01:25:08.133 --> 01:25:09.395
Seven.

01:25:14.038 --> 01:25:15.596
Starting at ground zero...

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:17.437
and moving out
in concentric circles,

01:25:17.475 --> 01:25:19.534
we have, in terms
of immediate effect,

01:25:19.577 --> 01:25:23.638
100% fatalities to 30 miles,
90% at 40 miles,

01:25:23.681 --> 01:25:26.980
dropping roughly 10%
for every 10 miles after that.

01:25:27.719 --> 01:25:28.743
Two.

01:25:31.423 --> 01:25:32.515
One.

01:25:35.894 --> 01:25:37.156
Enter.

01:25:39.297 --> 01:25:40.889
Enter.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:47.867
We estimate...
250,000 dead on impact...

01:25:47.906 --> 01:25:50.602
and another quarter-million
projected within the year.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:56.669
Enter.

01:25:57.916 --> 01:26:00.612
Come on. Just push "enter,"
and it's done.

01:26:03.922 --> 01:26:05.981
Which is it going to be, hmm?

01:26:09.494 --> 01:26:11.359
Ahh. Hmm.

01:26:12.864 --> 01:26:16.265
To tell the truth, I thought
you were going to fold.

01:26:17.402 --> 01:26:19.233
Well, I'm dead either way.

01:26:20.271 --> 01:26:22.466
So do it yourself, asshole.

01:26:25.443 --> 01:26:26.774
Open the door!

01:26:32.083 --> 01:26:33.380
Night-night, honey.

01:27:18.196 --> 01:27:21.097
- Cover me.
- Good luck.

01:27:24.769 --> 01:27:26.566
Uhh! Uhh!

01:27:27.438 --> 01:27:28.632
Bring it in.

01:27:52.597 --> 01:27:54.121
Give me your hand.

01:28:06.978 --> 01:28:08.946
OK... you can come.

01:28:15.053 --> 01:28:16.680
Get me down there!

01:28:30.034 --> 01:28:31.558
Let's give those guys a haircut.

01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:39.337
Shit!

01:28:39.377 --> 01:28:40.503
Get down!

01:28:52.223 --> 01:28:53.281
Freeze!

01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:25.217
- Wow.
- That was a first for me, too.

01:30:03.895 --> 01:30:06.022
Uhh!

01:30:14.038 --> 01:30:15.528
Uhh!

01:30:35.393 --> 01:30:37.418
This is where you two get off.

01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:50.129
No!

01:31:32.883 --> 01:31:35.010
- We're leaving, now!
- Yes, sir!

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:38.415
- Where's Shepherd?
- He's supposed to be here.

01:31:38.456 --> 01:31:39.514
Find him!

01:31:56.006 --> 01:31:57.337
Cut the power!

01:31:59.577 --> 01:32:01.010
Aaah!

01:32:01.445 --> 01:32:03.513
Aaah!

01:32:13.924 --> 01:32:15.448
Goddamn you, Hale.

01:32:21.265 --> 01:32:23.529
We're never going
to get clear in time.

01:32:23.567 --> 01:32:26.092
We need to shut down the nuke.
You hear me?

01:32:26.136 --> 01:32:29.071
- You need to disarm it.
- Find Hale.

01:32:54.665 --> 01:32:56.394
Oh, God. Your shoulder.

01:32:57.501 --> 01:33:00.629
- Help me off with this.
- Oh, God.

01:33:19.023 --> 01:33:22.390
No matter what, this train
can't make it to the city.

01:33:23.761 --> 01:33:25.991
So you stay here
and uncouple the car.

01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:27.657
I'm going to go after Deakins.

01:33:31.101 --> 01:33:33.433
- I'll see you soon.
- You promise?

01:33:51.956 --> 01:33:53.947
Fuck them if they
can't take a joke.

01:34:04.268 --> 01:34:05.826
What the fuck are you doing?

01:34:31.729 --> 01:34:33.924
Shut that son of a bitch
down, now!

01:34:33.964 --> 01:34:36.023
This ain't what I signed on for.

01:34:36.066 --> 01:34:38.694
I'm not ready to die,
not for you.

01:34:39.336 --> 01:34:42.999
Everybody dies, Kelly.
I'm as good a reason as any.

01:34:47.111 --> 01:34:49.443
Come on. Come on.

01:34:52.349 --> 01:34:53.338
Hale!

01:34:57.221 --> 01:34:58.654
Incoming!

01:35:00.557 --> 01:35:02.320
Uh!

01:35:03.994 --> 01:35:06.485
Yaaah!

01:35:27.317 --> 01:35:29.251
Come on out, Deak.
It's over.

01:35:45.169 --> 01:35:46.659
Ha ha ha!

01:35:51.041 --> 01:35:52.633
You lose.

01:35:52.676 --> 01:35:54.701
I still got my finger
on the trigger.

01:35:55.612 --> 01:35:57.443
That's the remote trigger.

01:35:57.481 --> 01:36:01.474
You see, if I press
this button here, you lose.

01:36:02.352 --> 01:36:04.217
And if I push this button...

01:36:05.589 --> 01:36:07.113
The weapon is disarmed.

01:36:08.625 --> 01:36:10.286
Why don't you disarm it, then?

01:36:11.195 --> 01:36:12.628
I'm not in the mood.

01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:14.829
Get rid of your weapon.

01:36:16.033 --> 01:36:17.523
Get rid of your weapon.

01:36:19.369 --> 01:36:20.597
Come on.

01:36:24.975 --> 01:36:27.739
That-a boy.
Now you can shut it down.

01:36:27.778 --> 01:36:29.769
You just have to
come and get it,

01:36:29.813 --> 01:36:32.839
and $20 that I took
from you last night...

01:36:34.251 --> 01:36:35.775
Says that you won't.

01:36:39.857 --> 01:36:43.054
- You're out of your mind.
- Yeah. Ain't it cool?

01:36:43.093 --> 01:36:46.722
I'm serious. Your mind
has taken a walk off the map.

01:36:46.764 --> 01:36:49.756
Maybe, but I'm still
going to kick your ass.

01:37:02.613 --> 01:37:04.740
All right,
you're bleeding, aren't you?

01:37:04.782 --> 01:37:08.240
Good. Let's see if we can't
get more out of you.

01:37:11.121 --> 01:37:12.145
Uh!

01:37:54.598 --> 01:37:56.498
Ahh!

01:38:01.138 --> 01:38:03.265
Every fight used to go
to a knockout.

01:38:03.307 --> 01:38:05.434
Know how it feels
to be knocked out?

01:38:25.529 --> 01:38:27.724
Your brain presses
against your skull,

01:38:27.764 --> 01:38:29.459
and it feels like this.

01:38:41.078 --> 01:38:42.477
Ah!

01:39:20.651 --> 01:39:22.175
Feel anything like that?

01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:31.306
I win.

01:41:32.249 --> 01:41:34.240
Sir, please turn around.

01:41:59.242 --> 01:42:01.073
My name is Riley Hale.

01:42:02.512 --> 01:42:03.945
Terry Carmichael.

01:42:05.148 --> 01:42:06.479
Pleased to meet you.

01:42:06.516 --> 01:42:08.950
You know, you're still
under arrest, captain.

01:42:08.985 --> 01:42:12.148
Oh, yeah?
I guess you better take me in.
