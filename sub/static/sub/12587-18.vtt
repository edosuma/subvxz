WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.428
Summer.

00:03.420 --> 00:05.593
It's what America does best.

00:05.589 --> 00:07.683
Heck, we were born
in the summer.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.139
Oh, my goodness.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.102
Will you look at this outdoor
sofa and coffee table?

00:15.098 --> 00:16.395
Wow.

00:16.391 --> 00:19.395
See, the trend today is
to make your outdoor space

00:19.394 --> 00:21.897
feel less backyard-y
and more living room-y.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.149
Come on, Hank.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.400
Sit with me.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.821
Dream with me.

00:25.817 --> 00:28.912
Well, I'm a guy who can sit
on just about anything,

00:28.904 --> 00:32.204
but this furniture
is gotdang lovely.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.917
Let's buy it.
All of it.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.786
What? Well, I...

00:35.786 --> 00:37.629
I...
This is all happening so fast.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.544
I don't...
Don't fight it.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.760
I need new pots for the summer.

00:47.756 --> 00:51.101
I'm planting hibiscus to attract
hummingbirds, bees,

00:51.093 --> 00:52.686
anything, really.

00:52.678 --> 00:53.804
I'm thinking,
"new hammock."

00:53.971 --> 00:56.599
For me, laying and
swaying in a hammock

00:56.598 --> 00:58.726
is like a steady morphine drip

00:58.725 --> 01:01.353
without the risk
of renal failure.

01:02.521 --> 01:03.898
Is that what I think it is?

01:03.897 --> 01:06.275
<i>Sancta Madre de Dios!</i>

01:06.275 --> 01:10.576
Hank!
Hank!

01:11.655 --> 01:13.123
It's beautiful.

01:17.911 --> 01:22.087
This will, no doubt, be the
best summer of our entire lives.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.504
Yep.
Yep.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.968
Well, I tell you what, man,

01:24.960 --> 01:27.839
I'd love to just chill back and
dang ol' grill and chill, man,

01:28.005 --> 01:30.053
but I'm gonna head up
to Canada this summer, man.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.300
Canada?

01:31.300 --> 01:34.770
A man only has
so many summers, Boomhauer.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.889
Why would you waste yours
in a country

01:36.888 --> 01:38.856
that's dismantling its Navy?

01:39.016 --> 01:41.895
Talking about house-swapping
with an ol' Canadian family,

01:41.893 --> 01:43.315
for, um, eh?

01:43.312 --> 01:44.780
House-swap?

01:44.771 --> 01:47.194
There's going to be Canadians
living here,

01:47.190 --> 01:49.659
walking around, touching things

01:49.651 --> 01:51.574
for three whole months?

01:51.570 --> 01:54.289
You're going to be gone
for an absurd amount of time.

01:54.281 --> 01:57.330
What if we all make new friends
or get remarried?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.463
It could happen.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.378
Love is funny.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.256
Have fun.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.300
Hope you got your shots.

02:09.295 --> 02:12.300
Boomhauer, don't you dare
come back a hockey fan.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.803
Well, man, you know I got to do
what I dang old got to do, man.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.900 --> 02:32.369
Miss him.
Miss him.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

03:05.310 --> 03:06.527
Yep.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.863
Yup.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.401
Yep.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.652
Look, I know
we all miss Boomhauer,

03:13.652 --> 03:15.905
but he wouldn't want us
crying in our beer.

03:15.904 --> 03:16.871
It looks like

03:17.030 --> 03:18.327
the Canadians are here.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.371
Boo!

03:20.367 --> 03:21.914
Now, be polite, Dale.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.412
We're Americans.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.665
We're the world's welcome mat.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.213
It doesn't matter
if they're from Canada, Laos,

03:28.208 --> 03:30.085
or, God forbid, California.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.759
Right now,
they're from Rainey Street,

03:32.754 --> 03:34.427
and it's our patriotic duty

03:34.423 --> 03:36.892
to show them what good neighbors
are all about.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.136
Fine.
Whatever.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.694
Holy jeez!

03:47.686 --> 03:49.905
This looks like one
of those spicy motels.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.773
Well, we wanted
something different

03:51.773 --> 03:52.865
than the lake this year.

03:52.858 --> 03:53.905
I think we got 'er.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.277
Oh, dear.

03:55.277 --> 03:56.904
I'm just going to slip
this young lady

03:56.903 --> 03:58.405
behind the Chesterfield.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.831
Hello and welcome
to the United States.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.829
Peggy Hill, at your service.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.297
Hank Hill. Good to meet you.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.917
Gordon Huskins.
It's a pleasure.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.088
Oh, sorry.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.303
This is my wife Maureen
and our son Ollie.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.638
How tall are you?

04:14.629 --> 04:15.881
Four foot eleven.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.680
Oh. Right on.
That's 150 centimeters.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.178
Hey, I sound tall in Canada.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.556
I wonder
if I'm thinner there, too.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.523
Keep talking.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.520
That's a good-looking T-shirt
you got there, Gordon.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.816
You in the mower business?

04:30.979 --> 04:32.322
Oh, I wish.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.907
But I've got a thing
for McCullum mowers.

04:33.899 --> 04:37.324
Canadian outfit.
Ride high. Ride strong.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.536
Ride McCullum.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.202
Now, that's a slogan.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.542
Maureen, this is for you.

04:43.533 --> 04:47.879
And join me, won't you,
on a 50-state tour of America?

04:47.871 --> 04:50.044
Here's Texas barbecue sauce,

04:50.040 --> 04:51.758
Washington apples,

04:51.750 --> 04:53.923
Vermont maple syrup.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.342
Oh, that's so nice.

04:56.338 --> 04:59.217
But we always travel
with our own pure maple syrup.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.809
It's like they say.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.895
"You don't want to drink the
water in every country." Eh?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.398
Uh-huh.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.610
I am telling you, Hank,

05:10.602 --> 05:13.446
those Canadians are not
who they pretend to be.

05:13.438 --> 05:17.363
That woman insulted me and every
maple tree in Vermont today.

05:17.359 --> 05:20.533
Peggy, they're probably not used
to dealing with neighbors.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.247
Canada is vast.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.913
They might go months
without seeing another person.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.331
Oh, Hank. You're
just easily enchanted

05:27.327 --> 05:29.295
by anyone in lawnmower apparel.

05:29.287 --> 05:32.917
That's why I wore my John Deere
beefy-T on our first date.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.918
No, I'm a good neighbor.
That's all.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.636
I can handle this.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.130
Remember when that old widow
couldn't take care

05:38.129 --> 05:39.881
of her yard anymore?

05:39.881 --> 05:41.804
Who forced her to move?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.848
I did.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.898
Hello. My name is Suzette.

05:55.897 --> 05:56.819
I live next door.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.326
Yeah, man, dang of bonjour, man.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.366
Here. I brought you some
coffee crisps, huh?

06:04.281 --> 06:07.831
Huh. We need to properly
position the kegerator.

06:07.826 --> 06:10.204
Some place where I can keep
one eye on the grill

06:10.203 --> 06:11.750
and one eye on the game.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.124
I might need to lay down
some chalk lines

06:14.124 --> 06:16.923
to make sure I get
the angles right.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.340
Eh! How's it going, everybody?

06:18.336 --> 06:20.213
Maureen made a nice tray
of her brownies, eh?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.840
So, what do you say?
Let's get at 'er!

06:22.007 --> 06:23.429
Well, thanks, Gordon.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.395
Hey, we're going to watch
Super Bowl XIII later.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.639
The Broncos' "orange crush"

06:28.638 --> 06:30.891
versus the Cowboys'
"doomsday defense."

06:30.891 --> 06:31.892
Want to pull up a chair?

06:31.892 --> 06:33.360
Oh, thanks, but you know,

06:33.351 --> 06:35.900
I prefer the fast-paced
Canadian three-down system.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.900
I mean, American football
is a real snoozer, huh?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.901
Enjoy your nap, though, eh?

06:42.986 --> 06:46.707
I'd like to put that chuckle
of his in a sandwich

06:46.698 --> 06:48.120
and make him eat it.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.413
He's okay, Dale.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.458
That must be how they
trash-talk in Canada.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.127
With little chuckles.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.170
Tell you what.
Peggy's dying to throw a party

06:56.166 --> 06:58.089
to break in
our new patio furniture.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.256
I'll invite the Canadians.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.755
You'll see.
They're regular folks.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.847
But enough of that.

07:03.006 --> 07:06.852
We need to build a bar worthy
of housing our kegerator.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.365
With this sophisticated
new furniture,

07:20.357 --> 07:24.112
I feel like we should be talking
about art or-or politics

07:24.110 --> 07:25.908
or-or this new furniture.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.702
I'm confused, Aunt Peggy.

07:27.697 --> 07:32.168
I feel like we're inside, but
I'm pretty sure we're outside.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.833
Thank you, Luanne.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.338
Yeah, it's a lovely
outdoor couch,

07:35.330 --> 07:37.298
but I'm starting
to get a little rash.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.840
Probably all the petrochemicals
in the synthetic fabric.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.761
Looks like everyone else
is doing fine.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.555
It might be that
your skin isn't used to

07:47.550 --> 07:49.393
warm sunlight and friendship.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.683
You might be right.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.807
Because these bugs don't seem
to hate it, either.

07:55.100 --> 07:59.105
Ooh, all right! It's going
to be that kind of party.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.903
Gentlemen, I know you've all
been waiting patiently

08:01.898 --> 08:06.369
and now, to commemorate our
first draft beer of the summer,

08:06.361 --> 08:11.663
I present to you your very own
personalized frosty beer mugs.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.830
Grab one.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.918
These will be kept here for you,
always chilled, always ready.

08:16.913 --> 08:20.133
Uh, wow.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.753
Gordon, I'd be honored
if you'd use Boomhauer's.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.554
Cheers, everybody!

08:44.899 --> 08:47.903
Well, I guess it's a fine beer,

08:47.902 --> 08:49.904
you know, if you're not
into flavor, but you love

08:49.904 --> 08:51.781
going to the washroom all night.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.868
Oh, sorry.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.371
Maureen's giving me
our secret signal to leave.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.260
Good to meet all you.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.178
This mug is Boomhauer.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.647
Gordon left him for dead
in those geraniums.

09:15.638 --> 09:16.890
If you ask me,

09:16.890 --> 09:19.894
I think America's building
a wall on the wrong border.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.363
This can't be right.
Nobody's that rude.

09:23.354 --> 09:27.700
There has to be some kind
of cultural misunderstanding.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.708
Uh, how can I help you, officer?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.702
This your house?
Yes, sir.

09:37.702 --> 09:38.874
We received a noise complaint.

09:39.037 --> 09:42.712
Noise complaint?
Nobody's making any noise here.

09:42.707 --> 09:43.924
I get so angry

09:43.917 --> 09:46.511
when people aren't respectful
of their neighbors.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.096
Did you ever stop to think

09:48.088 --> 09:50.716
that maybe there's
a bigger world out there

09:50.715 --> 09:52.888
than what's happening
right here?

09:52.884 --> 09:54.557
Here's a warning.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.896
You don't want to see me again.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.357
Wait. Which neighbors
would call the cops?

09:59.349 --> 10:00.521
Everybody's here.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.985
Except the Canadians.

10:11.486 --> 10:14.239
I can't believe Gordon
called the cops on us.

10:14.239 --> 10:17.539
He's going to be sorry
when he sees me today.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.832
It's about time
you woke up, Hank.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.922
Anger is more fun when shared.

10:21.913 --> 10:24.883
Mom, can I have another
half liter of OJ, please?

10:24.874 --> 10:25.921
What?

10:25.917 --> 10:28.887
Bobby, we speak English
in this house.

10:28.878 --> 10:32.803
But, Dad, Canada's metric system
makes so much more sense.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.889
A yard, a foot, an ounce...

10:34.884 --> 10:36.386
That's so random.

10:36.386 --> 10:39.640
Why not measure things
in squirts and dog's tails?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.641
All right. That's it.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.565
No more Ollie.
No more metric talk.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.188
This is America, dang it.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.439
We know what we're doing.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.657
I got to go straighten this out.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.618
Hey there, Hank.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.157
Can I make you up
a rye and ginger?

10:54.154 --> 10:56.532
Nothing says summer
like an R & G.

10:56.531 --> 10:59.501
No. I want to talk
about last night, Gordon.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.792
Oh, yeah, what a nice party,
eh, Maureen?

11:02.787 --> 11:03.879
Super nice, Gord.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.921
You know, in America, it's okay
to call or just knock

11:07.917 --> 11:10.340
on your neighbor's door
if there's a problem.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.963
You don't need to call the cops.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.715
Oh, sorry about that.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.763
We're not familiar
with your local customs.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.886
You know, Hank,
you really ought to think

11:17.886 --> 11:19.888
about getting a McCullum mower.

11:19.888 --> 11:20.889
Quiet as a casket!

11:20.889 --> 11:22.607
And it won't damage
your grass blades.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.727
That's what's making your lawn
look so brown.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.738
You talking about
my grass blades, Canada?

11:28.730 --> 11:31.700
You know, maybe I'll
stop by that new McCullum dealer

11:31.691 --> 11:35.571
later on, see if they'll let me
test out a new model.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.368
Give Boomhauer a proper mow
while we're here.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.913
I told Boomhauer I'd take care
of his yard while he's away.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.788
Oh, yeah? Well, if you think
you have the right to his land,

11:43.786 --> 11:45.288
who am I to get in your way?

11:47.790 --> 11:49.588
Okay, fine.

11:49.584 --> 11:50.881
Real good, then.

12:06.893 --> 12:10.397
Oh, man, dang ol' ooh-la-la,
man, ol'...

12:12.398 --> 12:16.653
You know, before this,
I always drank out of a can.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.906
I never knew beer was yellow.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.328
That Gordon Huskins.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.827
All he talks about
is how great Canada is

12:23.826 --> 12:25.373
and what's wrong with America.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.123
I dodged bullets in the killing
fields for two extra years

12:28.122 --> 12:30.375
instead of going to Canada.

12:32.627 --> 12:35.130
Outside the Hill residence,
Peggy speaking.

12:35.129 --> 12:38.053
Oh, yes, Gordon. Oh, of course.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.141
Well, thank you.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.259
You bet.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.434
Uh-huh, okay,
I'm hanging up now.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.056
Hank, that was Gordon.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.854
They're whining about the music

12:46.849 --> 12:48.772
being too loud.
They're reading.

12:48.768 --> 12:52.147
Dang it, that man is
not ruining my summer.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.490
If I want to get rid
of those Canadians,

12:54.482 --> 12:55.904
I'm gonna have to do something

12:55.900 --> 12:57.197
I've never done before:

12:57.193 --> 12:59.867
be a bad neighbor.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.991
Go ahead, fellas, live it up!

13:05.451 --> 13:07.419
Yeah!
Oh, yeah!

13:31.602 --> 13:33.900
Oh, can we
please stop this, Hank?

13:33.896 --> 13:37.400
I can actually feel my liver
through my shirt.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.870
We can't let up.
This is for America!

13:44.365 --> 13:46.538
All right, you turkeys,

13:46.534 --> 13:48.207
I got a two-four
of Slewback's.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.921
You want to throw down?!
Let's throw down!

13:50.913 --> 13:52.586
Have a seat.

13:57.879 --> 14:00.849
Ah, now, this is a beer.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.888
Why can't America make
a decent ale?

14:02.884 --> 14:06.434
Probably because we're too busy
making medical breakthroughs

14:06.429 --> 14:09.808
and blockbuster movies
and going to the moon!

14:09.807 --> 14:12.902
Yeah, well, we invented
zippers, penicillin

14:12.894 --> 14:14.237
and the Zamboni!

14:14.228 --> 14:16.902
I love Canada's national anthem.

14:16.898 --> 14:18.866
Too bad they don't play it
much at the Olympics!

14:19.025 --> 14:21.824
And your money has a girl on it!

14:21.819 --> 14:22.911
You Americans,

14:22.904 --> 14:25.532
you're so gosh-darn ignorant
and self-centered.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.408
Tell me who
our prime minister is.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.751
Why?

14:28.743 --> 14:30.745
Bottom line, Gordon:

14:30.745 --> 14:32.918
my Mason could kick
your McCullum's ass.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.918
Oh! Oh!
That does it, eh?!

14:35.917 --> 14:37.919
Yay!
Yeah!

14:37.919 --> 14:39.136
That'll learn him.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.345
Don't mess with Texas!

14:41.881 --> 14:43.849
What the heck?!

14:49.764 --> 14:53.234
He's mowing Boomhauer's lawn
with a Canadian mower!

14:53.226 --> 14:57.072
Not if I have anything
to say about it!

14:59.899 --> 15:02.823
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

15:03.903 --> 15:05.905
Look, he's ready to turn!

15:05.905 --> 15:08.158
Take that, Canada!

15:10.159 --> 15:11.911
Ho, yeah!

15:11.911 --> 15:13.163
Way to be, Hank!

15:15.039 --> 15:19.590
Hank! That crazy Canuck
is mowing <i>your</i> yard!

15:23.047 --> 15:24.845
Bwah!

15:38.855 --> 15:41.449
Oh, God.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.910
.085

15:43.901 --> 15:47.075
That's a D-W-I for Y-O-U.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.665
.09

15:49.657 --> 15:51.534
Huh. You win, Canada.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.514
Are you da toof fairy?

16:05.506 --> 16:07.600
Give me a dollar!

16:08.634 --> 16:10.807
Hank Hill, you're free to go.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.352
Son! Welcome
to the club!

16:13.347 --> 16:14.849
Come on now.
Give me a hug!

16:15.016 --> 16:16.268
Thanks, Mr. Strickland.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.314
Who's this?

16:17.310 --> 16:18.653
J.J. Womack.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.817
I'm your best friend
in the world right now.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.153
Old J.J.'s
gotten me off the hook

16:23.149 --> 16:24.901
more times than I can count.

16:24.901 --> 16:27.154
Don't know how he does it
and don't ask.

16:27.153 --> 16:27.870
What about me?

16:28.029 --> 16:29.451
You're a foreign national

16:29.447 --> 16:31.199
who committed
a criminal offense.

16:31.199 --> 16:34.578
May God have mercy on your soul.

16:34.577 --> 16:35.920
Hank, you gotta help me!

16:35.912 --> 16:37.835
Oh, you mean, bail you
out of trouble?

16:37.997 --> 16:41.718
How terribly American
that would be of me, eh?

17:15.409 --> 17:17.627
They say jail can
make a man hard,

17:17.619 --> 17:19.463
but you look okay, Hank.

17:19.454 --> 17:21.924
Maybe a little harder,
but not much.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.635
Well, the DWI still goes
on my record,

17:24.627 --> 17:26.880
but thanks to Buck's lawyer,
I won't lose my license.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.883
But I have to go talk
to some high school kids

17:29.882 --> 17:31.884
about drinking and driving

17:31.884 --> 17:34.262
and look at some dead bodies
at the morgue

17:34.262 --> 17:37.061
and stay off my lawnmower
for six months.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.229
Six months with a push mower?

17:39.225 --> 17:40.852
That's hard time, my friend.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.895
But still, it's kind of sad

17:42.895 --> 17:44.647
that Gordon is stuck
in prison indefinitely.

17:44.647 --> 17:48.242
Yeah, kind of feel bad
for the guy, too.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.326
But come on.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.820
It's not like
he'll be tortured...

17:50.987 --> 17:51.863
officially.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.873
Hey, good news, everyone.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.082
Gordon got another death threat.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.419
But it's okay, they moved
him to a single cell

17:58.411 --> 18:00.914
with a roommate who,
they tell me, has his back.

18:06.836 --> 18:07.883
Boomhauer!

18:07.878 --> 18:08.879
There he is!

18:08.879 --> 18:09.880
Hey, there!

18:09.880 --> 18:11.052
Hello, Jeff.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.642
Oh, my, it's the 15th already?

18:13.634 --> 18:16.228
Would you mind if we stayed
a little longer?

18:16.220 --> 18:18.723
Gordon's in a bit
of a legal spot.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.691
Man, I'm kind of coming back

18:20.683 --> 18:22.651
to my dang ol' love nest, man.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.613
Suzette?!
What are you doing here?!

18:26.606 --> 18:28.324
What about Jean Paul?

18:28.316 --> 18:29.909
Jean Paul?
I hope he stay

18:29.900 --> 18:31.618
in that aluminum
mine forever, uh?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.158
I finished with that guy.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.202
<i>C'est ca, c'est tout.</i>
That's it! That's all!

18:36.407 --> 18:37.750
I see.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.665
Well, yes, of course,
we'll be out right away.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.038
Ollie and I will just sleep
in the rental car.

18:44.332 --> 18:47.085
"Give me your tired, your poor,

18:47.084 --> 18:49.883
"your huddled masses,"
et cetera...

18:49.879 --> 18:52.382
Maureen, Ollie,
you can stay with us.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.974
What are neighbors for?

18:57.595 --> 19:00.269
Are you sure you don't want
to stay inside?

19:00.264 --> 19:02.517
Oh, absolutely not.
We don't want to be

19:02.516 --> 19:04.814
any more of an imposition
than we already are.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.609
And frankly,
I feel like we are inside.

19:07.605 --> 19:08.902
That's very kind.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.366
What about the chemicals?

19:10.358 --> 19:13.157
I may have imagined
those chemicals.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.826
I imagine you're right.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.495
It's hard to enjoy a cold beer

19:18.491 --> 19:21.165
while others in the world don't
have a roof over their heads.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.881
Hard, yes. Impossible, no.

19:31.212 --> 19:34.887
You know, Canadians
might be sanctimonious

19:34.882 --> 19:37.431
and bland, but America has been

19:37.426 --> 19:40.600
protecting Canada ever
since England stopped.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.519
Who's there when tyranny strikes

19:42.515 --> 19:45.189
or when earthquakes hit
or tsunamis roll?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.527
We are.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.647
Fellas, we've got a neighbor
in trouble,

19:48.646 --> 19:50.865
and it's time we did something
about it.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.620
I'm not gonna pretend
I feel sorry

19:56.612 --> 19:58.910
for your Canadian friend
because I don't.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.580
But I could take pity
if the price was right.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.748
We're cash poor at the moment,

20:03.744 --> 20:05.872
but you look like a drinker.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.589
Perhaps we could barter.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.803
Good-bye, old friend.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.800
You treat her right, Womack!

20:17.800 --> 20:19.848
Keep her lines clean, you hear!

20:21.303 --> 20:23.180
Gordon, you're alive!

20:23.180 --> 20:24.272
Was it terrible?

20:24.265 --> 20:25.858
Did they humiliate you?

20:27.143 --> 20:29.896
This must be quite
a sacrifice for you, eh?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.818
You have no idea.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.581
Beer from a can.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.701
It's barbaric.

20:43.909 --> 20:44.910
See ya, guys.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.127
If you're ever up in Canada

20:46.120 --> 20:48.839
to get reasonably priced
pharmaceuticals or, you know,

20:48.831 --> 20:51.129
a breath of fresh air, huh,
look us up.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.880
Keep your stick
on the ice!

20:55.880 --> 20:57.632
The nerve of that guy!

20:57.631 --> 20:58.883
So ungrateful.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.727
Didn't even say thank you
for getting him out of jail.

21:01.719 --> 21:03.721
Or for giving up our kegerator,

21:03.721 --> 21:06.520
which had replaced trash day
as my favorite thing

21:06.515 --> 21:07.858
about this neighborhood.

21:07.850 --> 21:08.851
No, he didn't.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.270
But you know what?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.897
We were good neighbors,
and we did the right thing.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.865
That's what matters.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.245
Yup.

21:19.236 --> 21:20.237
Yep.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.205
Mm-hmm.
