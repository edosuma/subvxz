- (wind howling)

00:10.010 --> 00:11.625
( rattling )

00:13.138 --> 00:15.049
( music playing )

00:15.140 --> 00:17.096
(pencil scratching )

00:28.654 --> 00:30.690
( birds chirping )

01:03.772 --> 01:05.478
( clicks )

01:15.367 --> 01:17.574
(tapping )

01:27.462 --> 01:29.544
(flies buzzing )

01:30.674 --> 01:32.915
( music playing )

01:42.185 --> 01:44.392
( crow cawing )

01:57.951 --> 01:59.782
( door squeaks )

02:27.189 --> 02:28.429

03:33.588 --> 03:35.453
( hollow thuds )

05:53.520 --> 05:56.432
( infected snarling )

06:21.840 --> 06:22.795
( infected snarling )

06:25.051 --> 06:27.007
(snarling continues )

06:31.850 --> 06:33.260
(grunts)

06:36.062 --> 06:37.802
Don't forget your blade.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.318
The dead are drawn
by the cattle.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.116
They'll all die soon
for lack of water.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.794
( cow thuds )

07:12.223 --> 07:15.386
( men chattering )

07:18.813 --> 07:21.270
Putting down
the herd.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.851
I know.
It's the right call.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.192
It wasn't my call.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.448
- It was the Nation.
- Nick backed it.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.821
- (cow moos)
- | back it.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.700
But we'll keep
some milking cows.

07:41.795 --> 07:46.129
You know, it's we used to have
400 head once.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.548
This, it's...

07:48.635 --> 07:51.092
it's not even
a ranch anymore.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.636
Well, you never wanted
to be a rancher.

07:56.434 --> 07:59.267
| just didn't think
it would bother me this much.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.690
Look”.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.480
rain will fall
and we'll start over.

08:07.570 --> 08:11.233
And if we live long enough,
I'll get you more cows.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.360
- ( chuckles )
- I promise.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.699
You know, if Dad knew what was
gonna happen to this place,

08:18.790 --> 08:20.075
he would have
killed himself.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.626
Look, we've survived.
That's something.

08:28.717 --> 08:32.710
The ranch is livable. We can't say
that about any other place.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.635
I can.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.384
Vernon wasn't wrong.

08:37.475 --> 08:40.683
There are there are
other places like this.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.307
Otto didn't have
the monopoly.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.396
The Pacific Northwest
was Prepper central.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.768
That's a long trip.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.852
There are
closer places.

08:49.946 --> 08:53.780
We have a cabin in the low desert,
near the border.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.778
There's game enough
to hunt.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.155
It's it's
not much, but...

09:00.457 --> 09:01.993
for two.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.415
Are you serious?

09:06.171 --> 09:08.833
Everything I was
fighting for is gone.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.794
It's just dead land,
a bunker full of supplies.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.750
We're lucky
to have that.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.175
It was supposed
to be more.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.392
( chatter )

09:26.483 --> 09:28.599
Ofelia:
Hey,

09:28.693 --> 09:30.069
we're in
a better place.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.269
Take a breath.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.526
( sighs )
We dug a well to nowhere.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.700
Doesn't improve our lot,
and it doesn't make us friends.

09:38.787 --> 09:41.028
Greater good,
higher purpose.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.948
Besides, you're in charge.
Take solace in that.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.625
Yeah, I'm not
the leader.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.668
That's for Taqa.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.714
Walker and Madison don't
make it back, it's on us.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.249
And Alicia
and Otto's son.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.300
Jake is weak.

09:57.764 --> 09:58.970
True.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.139
I know they have to
gain your trust,

10:01.226 --> 10:02.591
| get that.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.846
But I have to
gain theirs.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.020
So we meet
in the middle.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.480
Nick's already
in the middle.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.687
Ofelia:
You trust him?

10:15.782 --> 10:17.773
Crazy Dog:
Everyone does.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.653
Got no want to lead.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.780
That's why
he should.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.409
( cattle mooing )

10:25.500 --> 10:27.661
- ( distant shouting)
- ( footsteps approaching )

10:29.963 --> 10:31.954
You didn't like
your steak?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.627
We're gonna have enough jerky to
last a year.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.045
IWIpass.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.853
I'm corrupting you.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.892
You look like shit.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.444
( chuckles )

10:56.531 --> 10:59.944
- You sleeping?
- Yeah, fits and starts.

11:00.034 --> 11:03.492
I killed a man, now I'm sleeping
in his house.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.993
- You could pitch a tent in the field.
- That a joke?

11:07.041 --> 11:10.408
You killed an evil, old man
to save your family.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.711
I did it so Mom
didn't have to.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.376
You're worried
about her?

11:17.719 --> 11:20.256
Yeah, of course.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.511
You're worried
about Troy?

11:26.561 --> 11:29.769
I took his father
from him.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.721
That's what's
keeping you up at night?

11:34.110 --> 11:37.694
Nick, how many fathers
has Troy killed?

11:37.780 --> 11:40.772
How many sons,
how many daughters?

11:43.536 --> 11:46.073
You don't owe Troy.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.535
You like him.

11:50.627 --> 11:54.495
You share the same
self-destruction.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.921
Maybe I'm as sick
as he is.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.680
( crickets chirping )

12:05.767 --> 12:07.507
(thuds )

12:09.687 --> 12:11.643
( scraping )

12:22.575 --> 12:24.736
( floorboards creaking )

12:24.827 --> 12:26.783
( music playing )

12:55.692 --> 12:57.353
( lighter clicks )

12:58.945 --> 13:00.731
( owl hooting )

13:00.822 --> 13:02.483
( distant dog barking )

13:02.573 --> 13:04.029
- ( footsteps approach )
- ( floorboard creaks )

13:04.158 --> 13:05.659
Jesus!

13:08.079 --> 13:10.035
That shit
will kill you, Nicky.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.495
Uh, you can't
be here.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.171
Here lam.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.340
( distant dog barking )

13:24.679 --> 13:26.419
Wanna sit down?

13:26.514 --> 13:28.050
No.

13:29.392 --> 13:30.848
I can't sit down,

13:30.935 --> 13:33.096
'cause if I sit down,
then I'm gonna pass out.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.149
And I can't pass out
'cause I'm on a mission.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.519
It's good you're alive.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.771
I don't think
you believe that.

13:41.863 --> 13:44.525
But you saved me

13:44.615 --> 13:46.947
in your own way,
so...

13:48.619 --> 13:50.610
I'm here to return
the favor.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.911
There's a reckoning
athand.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.835
Something new,
something to

13:58.880 --> 14:00.962
something
to delight in.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.256
What reckoning, Troy?

14:08.056 --> 14:10.297
A beast, man.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.889
From the desert,
I think.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.062
Where there's
no obstacles,

14:18.149 --> 14:22.813
nothing to keep it
from growing.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.071
It's bigger
than you can imagine.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.108
It's biblical.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.908
(whispers ) Okay, you got
two options.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.660
Either you sneak out
the way you came in

14:36.751 --> 14:38.161
before Crazy Dog
sees you

14:38.252 --> 14:40.629
or I can hide you
a couple of days.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.421
Troy.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.628
There is
a third way.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.385
( lock clicks )

14:53.476 --> 14:54.932
Now, you need
to listen to me,

14:55.019 --> 14:57.852
okay, 'cause this
this is important.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.647
In a few hours,
this

15:01.734 --> 15:05.318
whole place
is gonna be obliterated.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.151
Open up.
Open the door, Troy.

15:09.200 --> 15:13.193
- Open the door, Troy.
- I want you to get Jake

15:13.287 --> 15:15.369
'cause I want him
to see this.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.331
It's beautiful.

15:23.714 --> 15:24.703
Troy.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.006
( music playing )

15:43.609 --> 15:45.986
- ( distant men shouting )
- ( footsteps approaching )

15:55.079 --> 15:57.661
We should talk about
another well.

15:57.748 --> 16:00.330
No, everything runs
off the same aquifer.

16:00.418 --> 16:01.954
All right, so then
we go outside the ranch.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.501
We pump it in,
truck it in.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.750
That's what Madison
and Walker are doing.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.712
She didn't call in last night
or the night before.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.797
We have no idea
if they'll find water

16:12.889 --> 16:14.971
or if they're
even coming back.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.718
They're coming back.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.674
They'll survive the trip,

16:18.769 --> 16:21.556
but what they bring back, Alicia,
it won't be enough to sustain.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.148
We need a plan B.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.690
How can you talk
about leaving?

16:28.613 --> 16:30.820
I'm fighting
for this place, Jake.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.566
We need to do
something here.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.070
VVhy?

16:39.123 --> 16:41.239
We're staying here.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.915
Get right with it.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.788
I can't worry
about you on top of.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.669
Look, Alicia,
I don't need your worry.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.876
You sure as hell did
when I looked after you.

16:52.970 --> 16:56.508
Well, thank you, and you're released
from your obligation.

16:56.599 --> 16:59.432
I didn't do it
out of obligation.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.975
So, why did you do it?

17:05.274 --> 17:07.560
Who is it
you're fighting for?

17:07.652 --> 17:11.691
Is it the ranch,
your family?

17:11.781 --> 17:13.988
What are you
actually fighting for?

17:16.327 --> 17:20.411
You know, when you came here
that day, you seemed so lost.

17:20.498 --> 17:24.207
I almost thought that I had
taken advantage of you.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.502
But was it
the other way around?

17:28.589 --> 17:31.331
- Go to hell.
- I knew what you were going through

17:31.425 --> 17:33.131
and I knew
it was impulsive, but...

17:33.219 --> 17:35.961
but I did convince myself
that you actually liked me.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.130
Idid!

17:39.225 --> 17:41.841
- I do.
- So then, what is this, Alicia?

17:41.936 --> 17:45.428
Is this a relationship
or is it an alliance?

17:46.440 --> 17:48.146
Was that the plan
all along?

17:48.234 --> 17:49.974
Madison works Otto,
Nick bonds with Troy,

17:50.069 --> 17:52.025
while you...
while you seduce me?

17:52.113 --> 17:54.445
( knocking on door)

18:01.539 --> 18:03.075
Troy was
at the house.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.998
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.871
Looked like
he hadn't slept in days.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.748
- I think he's lost it.
- Where is he now?

18:09.839 --> 18:11.420
Ran off.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.793
He said he wanted to warn us.
Something's coming.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.590
Wanted you to see
whatever it is.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.676
All right.

18:17.763 --> 18:20.550
All right, Madison drove him north.
He doesn't know that land.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.761
So he probably followed the sun west
to McCarthy's Outpost.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.763
- Let's go.
- Troy is full of shit.

18:24.854 --> 18:27.937
- He's baiting you, both of you.
- Well, it worked.

18:28.024 --> 18:31.061
I warned him not to come back,
and he has to face that.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.392
l have to face him.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.228
( footsteps recede )

18:38.784 --> 18:40.524
Nick, you can't go.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.661
I'm responsible.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.491
Plus, someone's gotta
look after your boyfriend.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.539
Jake.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.546
No, walkies,
they're useless.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.795
Just take it anyway.

19:01.849 --> 19:02.964
Look”.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.721
I did it for you.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.726
You're the last
good man I know.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.733
(car door opens,
closes)

19:18.824 --> 19:20.860
(engine starts )

19:33.422 --> 19:36.289
( music playing )

19:48.396 --> 19:51.138
You know, Troy could've
killed me last night.

19:51.232 --> 19:54.065
Why would
he kill you?

19:54.151 --> 19:56.187
Well, he wouldn't, but,
you know, he could've hurt me.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.610
That's my point he could've hurt
any of us, and he didn't.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.236
I think he came
to warn, not harm.

20:05.079 --> 20:07.445
When I was 12,

20:07.540 --> 20:10.703
coyotes were hassling the herds
during breeding season,

20:10.793 --> 20:12.784
so I went out to hunt
at twilight

20:12.878 --> 20:14.584
just over that hill.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.540
And | find this rabbit

20:18.634 --> 20:22.218
staked to the ground,
skinned alive.

20:23.431 --> 20:24.762
What'd you do?

20:26.559 --> 20:28.515
I put it down because
that's what you do

20:28.561 --> 20:31.098
when something's
lame or sick.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.768
He's not gonna stop.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.195
He's not gonna get better.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.776
I warned him.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.663
Shit!

20:59.425 --> 21:01.416
( music playing )

21:17.109 --> 21:18.315
(engine turns off)

21:21.989 --> 21:24.196
( music playing )

21:25.576 --> 21:27.942
( distant rumbling )

21:30.372 --> 21:32.704
- Alicia, can you hear me? Over.
- ( static crackles )

21:34.376 --> 21:36.367
Nick?
Where are you?

21:36.462 --> 21:38.874
Nick:
...an infected...

21:38.964 --> 21:41.046
- Infected what?
- ...coming your...

21:41.133 --> 21:43.749
- Do you copy?
- Tell me where you are and I'll come get you.

21:45.679 --> 21:48.466
It’s a horde,
and it’s coming.

21:48.599 --> 21:51.181
( distant rumbling )

21:57.024 --> 21:59.185
If they go right, there's no turning
them back.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.891
Let's go.
We'll take the truck.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.602
We'll lead them to the left,
they'll follow us.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.733
- (gunshot, explosion )
- ( infected snarling )

22:05.825 --> 22:07.736
(snarling continues )

22:18.420 --> 22:21.583
No, no, no, no.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.974
Nick and Jake are in trouble.
They went out this morning,

22:35.396 --> 22:37.136
and I think they
came across a horde.

22:37.231 --> 22:40.940
- You think?
- Well, the radio's for shit, but, yeah.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.733
We need to go out there and see
what we're dealing with.

22:43.821 --> 22:46.107
Wait, why'd they
go alone?

22:46.240 --> 22:48.777
- Does it matter?
- Yeah, it matters.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.325
We scout in packs,
safety in numbers.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.118
It's protocol,
you know that.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.374
- Troy snuck into the camp last night...
- ( sighs )

22:58.460 --> 23:01.202
...and told Nick there was something
wrong going on out there.

23:01.297 --> 23:02.833
Troy,
how wonderful.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.665
Yeah, Crazy Dog
is gonna be overjoyed.

23:06.969 --> 23:09.130
He doesn't have to know
how we know.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.839
- We just need to stop it.
- How do I know Troy's not waiting to ambush?

23:12.933 --> 23:15.515
You don't.

23:15.603 --> 23:19.187
But I trust Nick
and Jake to stop it.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.434
Have a little faith,
Ofelia.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.686
( music playing )

23:23.777 --> 23:26.189
( infected snarling )

23:29.366 --> 23:31.743
Hey, just give me
a minute with him?

23:31.827 --> 23:34.113
Nick, Nick, look at
everything he's done.

23:34.204 --> 23:36.866
- He's not coming back from this.
- Can I try?

23:36.999 --> 23:38.614
If he fires...

23:50.137 --> 23:51.798
It's a cleansing.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.058
Troy.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.476
Listen.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.807
You're not
in your right head, man.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.025
Yeah.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.320
A little punchy,
I admit.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.739
Leading these guys
on foot for two days,

24:12.826 --> 24:14.407
two nights.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.662
I stop, they stop.

24:18.749 --> 24:22.037
They need
constant stimuli

24:22.127 --> 24:26.211
sight, smell, sound.

24:29.093 --> 24:31.425
They love loud noises.

24:31.512 --> 24:32.467
(cocks gun )

24:34.640 --> 24:36.676
Jake:
Don 't do this, Troy.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.435
I love that sound.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.017
I love that sound

24:45.109 --> 24:47.065
the way some love
when a

24:47.152 --> 24:51.065
when a ball hits the fat of a bat,
you know?

24:52.908 --> 24:54.239
Good wood.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.614
You ever one for
organized sports, Nick?

24:57.705 --> 24:59.036
No.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.372
Jake was.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.952
Jake was
All-Everything.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.551
I told you
it was beautiful, didn't I?

25:11.635 --> 25:13.091
And this...

25:14.888 --> 25:16.219
this is evolution.

25:16.306 --> 25:18.638
This is...
this is Darwinian.

25:18.726 --> 25:22.469
No, this is murder, Troy,
nothing more.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.104
Murder?

25:26.191 --> 25:28.273
You really wanna
go there, Nick?

25:28.318 --> 25:30.695
You don't wanna kill
everybody at the ranch.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.360
Troy: They see this,
they'll run.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.814
They don't, it's eviction
or extinction.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.489
Drop the launcher, Troy.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.196
Don't make me
do this.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.995
Don't make you do what?

25:42.082 --> 25:44.869
You were gonna shoot me, you'd
have done that a long time ago.

25:44.918 --> 25:47.455
I swear on Dad's grave,
l'll shoot you.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.411
I'll kill you,
brother, I will.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.461
(gunshot)

25:53.135 --> 25:54.796
( distant explosion )

25:54.887 --> 25:57.503
( music playing )

25:57.639 --> 25:59.971
( distant horse neighs )

26:00.059 --> 26:02.015
Jake, stop, okay?

26:02.102 --> 26:03.842
- We can still beat them back to the ranch.
- Go!

26:03.937 --> 26:06.679
Just go, Nick! There's still time
to evacuate.

26:06.774 --> 26:09.516
- It's not that easy. One road in, one road out.
- Shut up.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.350
- You face the monsters or
you die in the wasteland.

26:11.445 --> 26:12.730
- Shut up!

26:13.363 --> 26:16.321
Jake, you'll never
live it down.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.199
You know
they scream, Nick?

26:19.286 --> 26:21.777
Rabbits, they

26:21.872 --> 26:24.204
they scream like
human beings.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.122
Tell me
about the rabbits.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.371
But I still
protected him.

26:28.462 --> 26:31.295
- You left me, brother.
- | always protected you!

26:32.716 --> 26:34.547
Jake, you pull
that trigger,

26:34.635 --> 26:36.546
you're gonna wake up
with it every day.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.509
You will never get it
out of your head.

26:38.639 --> 26:41.301
It's still ricocheting
inside your skull, Nick?

26:41.391 --> 26:43.973
What... what are you
talking about?

26:44.061 --> 26:45.517
What is he
talking about?!

26:45.604 --> 26:47.185
You tell it best,
Nick.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.854
I don’t wanna
steal your thunder.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.898
( sighs )
I am sorry.

26:51.985 --> 26:53.725
Don't say sorry to me.

26:53.821 --> 26:54.776
Say it to him.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.156
Troy:
You didn't know?

27:03.247 --> 27:06.239
l was sure as shit
Alicia would've told.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.790
Oh, you
you know she knows.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.659
She doesn't, okay?

27:10.754 --> 27:12.369
Jake, she didn't.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.131
It doesn't matter.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.220
( sniffles )

27:19.304 --> 27:22.171
I don't care what you did.
( sighs )

27:22.266 --> 27:24.928
(Jake chuckles )
It just doesn't matter.

27:25.018 --> 27:26.007
I don't care.

27:29.439 --> 27:31.100
You thinking
of checking out?

27:32.734 --> 27:35.817
Hey, we can
we can do it together.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.860
No, little brother.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.278
You have to take this trip
on your own.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.990
Nick:
Jake.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.199
Jake,no!

27:49.543 --> 27:52.330
- Ofelia: Jesus.
- Alicia: How far do you think?

27:52.421 --> 27:54.377
Crazy Dog: No more than
half a mile away.

27:54.464 --> 27:56.716
Fair estimate.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.339
We gotta evac.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.839
Taqa left us
to protect this place.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.715
We can't run.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.717
Last stand it is.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.971
( music playing )

28:10.439 --> 28:12.054
- ( snarling )
- Troy: Jake!

28:14.776 --> 28:16.437
(grunting )

28:19.573 --> 28:21.313
(Jake screaming )

28:27.664 --> 28:30.497
- How long, Troy?
- What?

28:30.584 --> 28:32.700
- How long?
- Nick.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.204
How long
before it spreads?

28:34.296 --> 28:36.662
How long before
the infection takes him?

28:36.798 --> 28:38.709
- I don't know.
- Just do it!

28:38.759 --> 28:40.465
Do it!

28:40.552 --> 28:41.928
Do it.

28:42.012 --> 28:43.752
All right.

28:43.847 --> 28:45.587
Stretch out his arm.

28:45.641 --> 28:48.178
- Stretch it out.
- Just shut up and do it!

28:48.268 --> 28:50.759
Stretch out his goddamn arm!
Come on!

28:50.854 --> 28:52.810
( music playing )

29:01.156 --> 29:03.192
( screaming )

29:07.454 --> 29:10.321
Why were Nick and Jake out there?
Troy came up on Nick before dawn.

29:13.043 --> 29:14.704
He was here?

29:14.795 --> 29:16.410
He said something
was coming.

29:17.631 --> 29:20.247
Something that
might wipe us all out.

29:20.342 --> 29:22.754
Something he saw or something
he brought down on us?

29:22.844 --> 29:24.425
You don't know
he did this.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.925
Troy may have
saved our lives.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.265
Should have shot him
when I had the chance.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.059
That's not
what Taqa wanted.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.765
This isn't helping.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.726
We could start with sticks
and stones, brother,

29:40.821 --> 29:43.779
bows and blades, but if the dead
come in droves,

29:43.865 --> 29:46.607
we're gonna need bullets,
all of us.

29:54.668 --> 29:55.953
Lee.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.302
Fine.

30:08.390 --> 30:09.926
Let's arm up.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.731
( music playing )

30:28.827 --> 30:31.534
Keep pressure on it. We can treat
him back at the ranch.

30:31.621 --> 30:34.533
There's no ranch
to go back to.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.706
( infected snarling )

30:50.515 --> 30:52.892
Nudge it forward
a little.

30:52.976 --> 30:54.056
Tight seal.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.272
Good.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.104
(engine turns off)

31:04.196 --> 31:07.313
( chatter)

31:13.330 --> 31:15.036
Is this really
gonna stop anything?

31:16.249 --> 31:18.240
It's not supposed
to stop them.

31:18.335 --> 31:21.668
Keep 'em moving east and west
alongside us.

31:21.755 --> 31:24.212
We hunker down behind
while they go past.

31:26.468 --> 31:28.379
You got a better idea?

31:28.470 --> 31:30.882
( static crackles )

31:30.972 --> 31:32.428
(walkie turns off)

31:32.516 --> 31:33.722
Time!

31:33.809 --> 31:35.219
All right, guys,
let's go, let's go!

31:35.310 --> 31:37.642
- Behind the wall.
- ( people shouting )

31:37.729 --> 31:39.890
Let's go!
Drop it!

31:39.981 --> 31:42.358
- Let's go, follow me. Come on!
- Move!

31:42.401 --> 31:44.312
Man:
Grab your sister. Go!

31:48.156 --> 31:50.238
( infected snarling )

32:00.669 --> 32:03.001
( infected snarling )

32:23.567 --> 32:24.852
(walkie turns off)

32:27.070 --> 32:29.777
( infected snarling )

32:29.865 --> 32:33.198
( gate rattling )

32:33.285 --> 32:35.776
( snarling )

33:07.652 --> 33:09.392
Oh, my God.

33:20.457 --> 33:22.789
- ( infected snarling )
- Man: Brace up against it.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.712
- ( RV creaking )
- ( people shouting )

33:31.510 --> 33:33.171
- (thudding)
- Whoa!

33:39.309 --> 33:40.970
Man: Let's go.
Here they come!

33:41.061 --> 33:43.427
- ( snarling )
- Man #2: Underneath! Underneath!

33:43.480 --> 33:44.686
Woman:
Watch your feet!

33:46.525 --> 33:47.856
( squelches )

33:50.487 --> 33:53.979
( squelching )

33:54.074 --> 33:56.486
- ( thudding )
- ( infected snarling )

34:04.668 --> 34:06.624
(sighs )

34:06.711 --> 34:08.918
( distant infected
snarling )

34:17.347 --> 34:19.713
Troy: He wasn't
supposed to die.

34:24.229 --> 34:26.015
Not like this.

34:26.106 --> 34:29.564
He was the one that
wasn't supposed to die.

34:29.651 --> 34:31.437
( sniffs )

34:34.281 --> 34:35.817
You need
to put him down now.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.283
( static crack/es )

34:37.367 --> 34:38.823
I wanted him
to see.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.286
I wanted him
to see what I'd...

34:40.370 --> 34:42.486
what I'd done
for us, you know?

34:44.082 --> 34:45.947
You wanted him
to see what?

34:46.042 --> 34:47.828
Here, come, let me show you
what you did. Come on.

34:47.919 --> 34:51.127
Look, this is what
you did for us, Troy.

34:51.214 --> 34:53.830
Look at it.
That's you.

34:59.806 --> 35:02.593
Alicia,
can you hear me, over?

35:04.811 --> 35:06.392
Just kill me, Nick.

35:08.815 --> 35:11.101
Do what my brother
should’ve done.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.115
Kill yourself.

35:22.245 --> 35:24.281
- ( snarling)
- ( rumbling)

35:30.462 --> 35:32.293
They've stopped
going under.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.881
They're packed
too tight to move.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.378
It's not gonna hold.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.052
Once this gives, everyone out here
is gonna die.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.130
That's the job.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.306
Protect the others.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.404
( creaking )
