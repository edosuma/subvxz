Stonebridge?
Can you get him back?

00:57.972 --> 01:00.005
<i>Stonebridge, come in.</i>

01:05.782 --> 01:07.016
<i>Stonebridge?</i>

01:13.325 --> 01:14.691
The transmitter's
been destroyed.

01:24.503 --> 01:26.104
You have been
hiding people.

01:26.138 --> 01:27.438
You're out of your mind.

01:27.473 --> 01:29.506
What about the woman
you met in the bar?

01:29.540 --> 01:30.740
Which woman?

01:31.942 --> 01:33.342
You were there, what,
five minutes?

01:33.376 --> 01:34.877
Mmm-hmm.

01:34.912 --> 01:36.178
With you in the lift.

01:39.915 --> 01:41.915
Oh, her.

01:41.949 --> 01:43.116
Yeah, I don't know
where she is.

01:43.150 --> 01:44.550
But you have
hidden her.

01:46.319 --> 01:47.619
You will take us to her.

01:47.654 --> 01:48.755
What for?

01:49.857 --> 01:50.890
Fuck!

01:50.924 --> 01:52.425
Fuck you.

01:53.494 --> 01:56.230
You will take us. Now.

02:00.235 --> 02:01.937
Going up?

02:01.971 --> 02:05.741
So, the man with Stonebridge said
we can stop looking for Latif.

02:05.775 --> 02:07.509
You think he was Latif?

02:07.543 --> 02:08.910
We'll find out soon enough.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.585
That lobby is laced with
explosives, General.

02:17.619 --> 02:20.445
You attempt an assault,
the blood of those hostages

02:20.470 --> 02:21.859
will be on your hands.

02:22.023 --> 02:23.884
And if Pakistani intelligence

02:23.909 --> 02:25.490
had done their job in the
first place, Major,

02:25.525 --> 02:27.226
those terrorists wouldn't
be in that hotel.

02:27.260 --> 02:29.628
General, my men
need more time.

02:29.662 --> 02:30.912
If that man is Latif,

02:30.937 --> 02:33.031
Colonel Grant, your men
are already dead.

02:33.066 --> 02:34.667
You don't know that.

02:34.701 --> 02:35.617
And you don't know how
many more hostages will

02:35.642 --> 02:36.917
be murdered if I delay.

02:37.505 --> 02:38.706
General, please.

02:40.341 --> 02:42.062
Give my men a chance
to resolve this.

02:42.087 --> 02:43.626
From the inside.

02:50.119 --> 02:51.661
You have until sunrise.

02:52.488 --> 02:53.688
Thank you, sir.

04:30.990 --> 04:32.924
At least we found Latif.

04:34.026 --> 04:35.227
That is Latif, isn't it?

04:36.429 --> 04:37.829
Uh, yeah.

04:37.863 --> 04:39.030
What do you mean?

04:39.065 --> 04:41.066
Porter was really the one
who dealt with Latif.

04:41.100 --> 04:44.136
When I saw him, he was really
far away, it was kind of dark.

04:46.005 --> 04:47.640
You never saw
Latif, did you?

04:48.908 --> 04:50.375
Not really, no.

04:51.978 --> 04:53.578
You fucking prick.

04:55.115 --> 04:56.315
It's this floor.

04:58.684 --> 05:00.151
Move.

05:00.185 --> 05:02.232
I want blow-ups of
every single person

05:02.257 --> 05:04.489
on CCTV in this hotel.

05:06.290 --> 05:08.177
We've checked with 6,
and CIA, no one has

05:08.202 --> 05:09.590
anything on Mahmood.

05:11.028 --> 05:13.396
Major, can you
enlighten us?

05:18.035 --> 05:21.290
Major, this is not just
about the hostages,

05:21.315 --> 05:24.222
or my men,
but capturing Latif.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.615
"Mahmood" is a code name.

05:31.650 --> 05:33.343
For a weapons scientist
who leaked secrets to

05:33.344 --> 05:34.537
our intelligence service

05:34.586 --> 05:35.652
for nearly a decade.

05:35.687 --> 05:36.720
So you know him.

05:36.754 --> 05:39.323
We don't know his
true identity,

05:39.357 --> 05:41.214
only that he was going to
surrender to me this evening,

05:41.239 --> 05:42.739
at the Royal Lotus Hotel.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.395
I was on my way there
when I got your call.

05:44.429 --> 05:46.134
You knew all this,
and you didn't think

05:46.135 --> 05:47.312
of telling us before?

05:47.331 --> 05:49.165
It's highly classified.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.778
And frankly, not
something our government

05:50.803 --> 05:51.901
wanted the British

05:51.902 --> 05:53.937
or American governments
to know.

05:53.971 --> 05:56.940
But Latif knew,
didn't he?

05:56.974 --> 05:58.642
That's why he's in Delhi.

05:58.676 --> 06:01.644
Why is this weapons scientist
so important to him?

06:01.679 --> 06:03.534
Mahmood went quiet nine
years ago,

06:03.559 --> 06:05.530
after the start
of the Iraq war.

06:06.217 --> 06:08.719
He resurfaced only last
month, out of the blue,

06:08.753 --> 06:12.055
requesting protection in
exchange for information.

06:12.089 --> 06:14.791
What kind of information
was he offering?

06:14.826 --> 06:17.094
Secrets about weapons
of mass destruction.

06:18.930 --> 06:24.067
Chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear.

06:47.958 --> 06:49.292
Hey!

07:15.517 --> 07:17.451
He says, "Rise,
my brother."

07:17.486 --> 07:19.294
He did not know you
are Muslim.

07:19.319 --> 07:21.094
He will not harm the faithful.

07:30.165 --> 07:31.799
He's a boy!

07:31.833 --> 07:33.034
No, please, no!

07:57.126 --> 07:58.126
In there.

07:58.161 --> 07:59.558
You are sure?

08:00.584 --> 08:02.084
It's
okay. Shh, shh.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.106
She must've left.

08:13.141 --> 08:14.908
Where is she?

08:14.942 --> 08:17.043
You wave that thing
around an awful lot.

08:17.078 --> 08:18.745
Where?

08:18.779 --> 08:20.514
I don't know.

08:20.548 --> 08:22.315
Kill me and you're
never gonna find out.

08:22.350 --> 08:25.452
Then I will kill him.
Ten seconds.

08:25.486 --> 08:26.586
Don't tell him, Scott.

08:28.155 --> 08:29.489
No worries, buddy.

08:29.523 --> 08:31.324
I really don't know where she is.

08:33.293 --> 08:34.360
That's good.

08:35.929 --> 08:37.229
I have no idea what you're saying.

08:37.263 --> 08:38.297
In English, is that five?

08:39.999 --> 08:41.466
You can kill him, but I really
don't know where she is.

08:49.408 --> 08:50.475
You shot?

08:50.509 --> 08:52.030
- A ricochet.
- Come on.

08:52.056 --> 08:53.256
The balcony. Move, move!

08:53.680 --> 08:54.932
Right behind
you, Scott. Right behind you.

08:54.957 --> 08:56.157
Move, move, move!

09:13.602 --> 09:14.803
Got it?

09:17.507 --> 09:18.873
Move, move, move, move.

09:40.799 --> 09:42.233
Come on.

09:42.267 --> 09:44.135
Better let
me look at that, Scott.

09:44.170 --> 09:45.532
I need
you to wait there for me,

09:45.557 --> 09:47.441
okay? Just stay there.

09:48.108 --> 09:49.875
- Fuck.
- Get down.

09:49.909 --> 09:51.343
Oh.

09:51.377 --> 09:52.978
Come here. With me.

09:59.885 --> 10:00.951
Fuck!

10:00.986 --> 10:02.186
What a waste.

10:03.555 --> 10:05.622
Here. Tell me I can
dance again, buddy.

10:05.656 --> 10:06.723
We'll see.

10:06.757 --> 10:07.924
Colonel.

10:09.660 --> 10:11.061
Turn it up.

10:11.095 --> 10:13.363
<i>...that at least</i>
<i>four hostages are still alive.</i>

10:13.397 --> 10:15.906
<i>We can now replay for</i>
<i>you the events just</i>

10:15.931 --> 10:17.231
<i>captured on camera.</i>

10:17.235 --> 10:20.294
<i>Four people, believed to be</i>
<i>among the hostages, were seen</i>

10:20.319 --> 10:21.919
<i>running from terrorists.</i>

10:21.940 --> 10:24.609
Tell General Kohli
our men are alive.

10:25.544 --> 10:26.878
Ow!

10:28.280 --> 10:29.581
Fuck!

10:30.682 --> 10:32.717
You find the fucking
thing already?

10:32.751 --> 10:34.239
Yeah, I found it.

10:34.264 --> 10:35.764
It's lodged against
your femoral artery.

10:35.820 --> 10:36.965
Shit.

10:36.966 --> 10:38.700
One slip of my knife, you're
gonna bleed to death all

10:38.725 --> 10:40.469
over this nice shiny floor.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.994
Shit.

10:45.028 --> 10:46.495
You kill me, your wife's
gonna be real pissed.

10:48.031 --> 10:49.098
Oh!

10:52.569 --> 10:55.805
No more jokes
about the wife.

10:55.839 --> 10:57.885
Since these might be your last
few moments on earth,

10:57.910 --> 10:59.314
you want to tell me
about Iraq?

11:00.011 --> 11:01.612
The cradle of civilization,

11:01.646 --> 11:03.347
where writing and
the wheel were invented?

11:03.382 --> 11:05.300
About your
dishonorable discharge, you tosser.

11:06.102 --> 11:07.388
I'm assuming you're a
damn good soldier,

11:07.413 --> 11:08.713
seeing as you're not dead,

11:08.755 --> 11:10.756
and neither are those
two girls out there.

11:10.790 --> 11:13.725
Oh, wow. Paying me
compliments now, huh?

11:13.760 --> 11:16.494
Guess I just pissed off
the wrong Chairborne Ranger.

11:16.529 --> 11:17.540
What do you mean?

11:17.541 --> 11:19.750
One day I'm heading
Delta squadron,

11:19.775 --> 11:21.479
searching for those WMDs,

11:22.869 --> 11:24.449
and we got a tip-off about

11:24.474 --> 11:27.643
some chemical weapon convoy
outside Ramadi.

11:28.442 --> 11:31.078
But something didn't
add up, you know?

11:31.112 --> 11:32.682
I questioned the intel,

11:32.707 --> 11:35.707
next thing I know, I'm up
on charges of possession.

11:35.716 --> 11:39.953
Yeah. They found two kilos
of opium in my locker.

11:39.988 --> 11:41.922
Then you got what
you deserved.

11:41.956 --> 11:43.690
The fucking dope wasn't
mine, dickhead.

11:43.725 --> 11:44.858
You telling
me you were set up?

11:44.893 --> 11:46.627
You're quick.

11:46.661 --> 11:48.462
I guess somebody wanted
me out of Delta.

11:48.497 --> 11:50.898
Yeah, but you don't know
who or why, do you?

11:50.933 --> 11:52.500
Well, we'll find out.

11:52.535 --> 11:53.762
And when I do, I'm going
to hang that

11:53.763 --> 11:56.732
motherfucker's
head on a stick.

11:58.273 --> 11:59.674
My God.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.176
Hey.

12:01.210 --> 12:02.977
Wow.

12:03.012 --> 12:04.312
Hey, nice work.

12:04.346 --> 12:06.281
Belt. Slowly.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.654
Look at that.

12:13.689 --> 12:14.755
Looks like you'll live.

12:14.790 --> 12:16.925
That's impressive.

12:16.959 --> 12:20.127
I'm sorry for those bad things
I said about you, buddy.

12:21.163 --> 12:23.131
What bad things?

12:23.165 --> 12:25.767
Pretty much everything I say
about you behind your back.

12:25.801 --> 12:28.269
That's all right.
I can take it.

12:28.303 --> 12:29.504
Ow!

12:35.277 --> 12:36.444
What do we do now?

12:36.478 --> 12:37.645
Hey.

12:38.914 --> 12:40.782
Come here, sweetheart.

12:40.816 --> 12:42.784
I need you to hide in here
for a couple more minutes.

12:42.818 --> 12:44.152
I'll be right outside.

12:45.922 --> 12:47.856
What's this about?

12:47.890 --> 12:50.425
You need to answer
some questions.

12:50.459 --> 12:53.762
Starting with who
the fuck you are.

12:53.796 --> 12:54.950
My name's Iman Zubedah.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.783
I work for a cosmetics
company in London.

12:56.866 --> 12:58.734
You have a passport,
Iman Zubedah?

12:58.768 --> 13:00.702
I think it's in my
hotel room, I...

13:02.004 --> 13:03.338
I don't know. I
lost it somewhere.

13:03.372 --> 13:04.772
Hmm.
That's convenient.

13:04.807 --> 13:06.675
I'm telling you the truth.

13:06.709 --> 13:09.310
These men out here? They've
been trying to kill us.

13:09.345 --> 13:12.147
Now you expect me to believe
that's all because you sell lipstick?

13:12.181 --> 13:14.249
I don't know. They must have me
muddled up with someone else.

13:15.284 --> 13:16.985
Who's Mahmood?

13:18.621 --> 13:20.588
What?

13:20.623 --> 13:22.946
Honey, I just got shot in
the leg,

13:22.971 --> 13:24.696
and it's making
me real cranky.

13:25.394 --> 13:28.462
You better start telling
me the truth. Right now.

13:37.138 --> 13:38.738
Who's Mahmood?

13:42.709 --> 13:44.243
He's my husband.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.346
Where is this husband now?

13:49.282 --> 13:50.549
Get me out of here,

13:52.285 --> 13:54.253
and I'll take you to him.

13:57.090 --> 13:58.724
Get her.

13:58.759 --> 13:59.926
Come on.

14:23.250 --> 14:24.984
Going left, buddy.

14:27.387 --> 14:29.655
Get down. Down!

14:36.063 --> 14:37.030
I got a dead end.

14:37.064 --> 14:38.498
I see a body.

14:57.184 --> 14:58.318
Damn it.

14:58.352 --> 14:59.786
Do you know her?

14:59.820 --> 15:01.788
Yeah.

15:01.822 --> 15:03.989
It's the other girl
I met in the bar.

15:08.294 --> 15:10.027
She meant to give me that.

15:18.404 --> 15:19.604
Here.

15:22.675 --> 15:24.642
Colonel, it's Stonebridge.

15:26.645 --> 15:27.779
Michael?

15:27.813 --> 15:29.447
<i>Sorry for</i>
<i>the interruption.</i>

15:29.481 --> 15:31.850
<i>You have less than an</i>
<i>hour before the Indian Army</i>

15:31.884 --> 15:33.618
<i>launch an assault</i>
<i>on the hotel.</i>

15:33.652 --> 15:34.819
You have to stop them.

15:34.853 --> 15:35.853
Stay there.

15:35.888 --> 15:38.156
These gunmen will
kill everyone.

15:38.190 --> 15:40.190
<i>It's impossible. They</i>
<i>won't be stopped.</i>

15:40.225 --> 15:42.226
Have you located
Mahmood?

15:42.261 --> 15:44.328
No, but I have someone here
who claims to be his wife.

15:45.563 --> 15:47.198
Iman Zubedah.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.368
<i>Iman Zubedah?</i>

15:50.402 --> 15:52.937
You know the name?

15:52.971 --> 15:54.509
She was born
in Britain.

15:54.534 --> 15:56.134
Moved to Pakistan in 1990.

15:56.375 --> 15:58.091
Worked as a research scientist

15:58.116 --> 15:59.316
for Dr. Quadeer Khan on our
weapons program.

16:00.580 --> 16:01.780
You're saying
she's Mahmood?

16:01.815 --> 16:02.848
She's the right age.

16:02.882 --> 16:04.050
She must be.

16:04.084 --> 16:05.451
<i>Stonebridge?</i>
<i>Is Zubedah near you?</i>

16:05.486 --> 16:07.854
Yeah, of course,
she's...

16:07.888 --> 16:09.122
Fuck!

16:09.156 --> 16:11.457
She's running. She's
running! Scott!

16:11.492 --> 16:13.025
Coming!

16:13.060 --> 16:14.260
Get her back.

16:17.731 --> 16:18.764
What's going on?

16:18.799 --> 16:20.032
Zubedah's Mahmood.
Shit.

16:20.067 --> 16:22.201
Come on.

16:22.235 --> 16:24.815
Hey, honey. I need you to be
really brave and stay there,

16:24.840 --> 16:26.840
okay? You understand?

16:26.939 --> 16:28.406
We'll be right back,
I promise.

16:34.546 --> 16:35.613
Okay.

16:35.648 --> 16:36.715
Going left?
Yeah.

16:36.749 --> 16:37.949
Going right.

16:56.202 --> 16:57.235
Get out.

16:57.269 --> 16:58.870
Let me go, please!

16:58.904 --> 17:01.272
Come here! You seriously think you're
gonna get out of here without me?

17:01.306 --> 17:03.407
I'll take my chances.
Just let me go!

17:03.442 --> 17:05.209
Okay.

17:05.242 --> 17:07.911
Hands off. Okay?

17:07.944 --> 17:09.311
Just relax.

17:12.049 --> 17:13.316
Don't get crazy.

17:14.652 --> 17:17.387
I heard what you
said back there.

17:17.421 --> 17:19.556
What did I say?

17:19.589 --> 17:21.361
Those WMD you were
supposed to find.

17:21.361 --> 17:22.207
The chemical convoy...

17:22.227 --> 17:23.794
There were no WMDs in Iraq.

17:23.829 --> 17:25.262
There were supposed to be.

17:26.866 --> 17:28.165
You're not making
any sense.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.335
They were meant to be
there. Planted there.

17:30.369 --> 17:32.437
But the plot was aborted
on the eve of the invasion,

17:32.471 --> 17:35.608
and the organization behind
it hid the weapons.

17:35.642 --> 17:37.644
I know who took them,
I've known all along.

17:37.678 --> 17:39.714
That's why Latif wants me.

17:39.739 --> 17:42.428
So that he can use those
weapons against the West.

17:44.886 --> 17:48.989
If what you're saying is true,
then the Brits and the Americans,

17:49.023 --> 17:51.191
they will protect you.

17:51.226 --> 17:52.400
What, like they protected you

17:52.405 --> 17:54.267
when you started asking
too many questions?

17:54.428 --> 17:55.495
What are you saying?

17:55.529 --> 17:58.231
You still don't
get it, do you?

17:58.265 --> 18:01.067
The organization who hid
those weapons

18:01.092 --> 18:04.155
can't afford for anyone
to know.

18:13.447 --> 18:16.249
I can't afford
to let you go.

18:16.283 --> 18:17.483
Come on.

18:39.809 --> 18:41.276
Fuck!

18:45.315 --> 18:46.515
Hey.

18:47.683 --> 18:49.317
It's okay.

18:49.352 --> 18:50.552
Fuck!

18:54.090 --> 18:58.928
Doctor Zubedah. Or should
I call you "Mahmood"?

19:48.512 --> 19:49.679
Scott?

19:54.585 --> 19:55.785
Scott?

20:41.800 --> 20:43.201
<i>Mahmood's</i>
<i>gone. So is Scott.</i>

20:43.235 --> 20:46.671
Scott is expendable.
She is not.

20:46.705 --> 20:48.009
Latif knows the assault's
coming.

20:48.034 --> 20:49.534
He must have an
escape route.

20:49.574 --> 20:51.476
Then find it.
<i>Copy that.</i>

22:29.110 --> 22:30.343
Hurry up. Move!

22:30.378 --> 22:31.578
Where are
you taking me?

22:34.015 --> 22:35.582
Where are
you taking me?

22:38.419 --> 22:40.553
Somewhere we can talk.

22:40.588 --> 22:42.155
And then you'll kill me.

22:42.190 --> 22:44.858
That depends
on what you have to say.

22:49.598 --> 22:51.232
One,

22:51.266 --> 22:53.067
two, three.

22:53.102 --> 22:54.302
Shit.

23:57.799 --> 24:00.233
Fuck me.

25:07.170 --> 25:08.370
Yes, sir.

25:13.943 --> 25:16.171
<i>As you can</i>
<i>see, the police are pushing</i>

25:16.196 --> 25:17.476
<i>us back at the moment.</i>

25:17.480 --> 25:20.382
<i>It's probably to prevent us</i>
<i>from filming an assault...</i>

25:20.416 --> 25:21.816
It's beginning.

25:21.851 --> 25:23.818
<i>on the building. We have to</i>
<i>assume that the terrorists...</i>

25:46.843 --> 25:48.010
Why are we stopping?

26:17.941 --> 26:19.141
Hey.

26:21.411 --> 26:22.411
Shh.

26:22.445 --> 26:24.146
Come here.

26:27.585 --> 26:29.052
Hey, buddy.

26:30.588 --> 26:32.088
She needs to go
to the bathroom.

26:34.024 --> 26:35.225
Toilet.

26:42.766 --> 26:44.199
She has to pee.

26:56.045 --> 26:57.379
Translate.

26:58.348 --> 26:59.548
Translate!

27:02.518 --> 27:06.787
I have been sitting there
watching you, and praying.

27:10.659 --> 27:13.461
Praying you push that
button in your hand.

27:16.799 --> 27:19.348
When you do, the people
you have terrorized will

27:19.349 --> 27:20.399
suffer no more.

27:23.073 --> 27:25.808
We will feel the warmth
of Allah's embrace,

27:25.842 --> 27:28.177
for we have raised our
arms against no man.

27:34.217 --> 27:38.053
But you, you who kill innocents
in the holy name of Allah,

27:41.857 --> 27:45.207
You will feel the wrath and
damnation of the almighty God

27:45.232 --> 27:47.422
whose faith you have defiled.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.412
I will kill her!

29:11.150 --> 29:12.950
I will kill...

29:18.924 --> 29:20.124
Are you okay?

29:21.861 --> 29:23.061
Are you okay?

29:26.966 --> 29:28.166
You all right?

29:30.202 --> 29:31.635
Are you all right?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.807
Good.

29:36.842 --> 29:38.812
I know you've been through
a lot,

29:38.837 --> 29:41.197
but I need you to
come with me.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.114
Come on.

30:11.079 --> 30:12.613
Come on, buddy.

30:12.647 --> 30:13.813
Please.

30:14.982 --> 30:17.383
Come on. She's
a little kid.

30:21.755 --> 30:22.955
Please.

30:36.069 --> 30:37.269
Thank you.

30:49.384 --> 30:52.152
Okay. Here we go.

30:52.187 --> 30:56.056
Um, here's a good
spot. Okey dokey.

30:56.090 --> 30:58.853
All right. Now, I need
you to be brave.

30:58.878 --> 31:00.178
Be brave, okay? Go down.

31:00.228 --> 31:03.598
Go on, crouch down. Make
yourself real small.

31:04.567 --> 31:06.268
Atta girl.

31:06.302 --> 31:08.537
Here you go. Yeah.

31:09.672 --> 31:12.040
It's a big scratch, huh?

31:14.743 --> 31:17.779
All right,
all right.

31:17.813 --> 31:21.916
Hey. I'm gonna
be right back. I promise.

31:23.218 --> 31:24.585
You wait there.

31:26.955 --> 31:28.790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm coming.

31:38.334 --> 31:39.501
Now!

32:11.335 --> 32:12.535
Whoa!

32:28.016 --> 32:29.817
Fuck me.

32:29.852 --> 32:31.619
Nice catch, buddy.

32:31.654 --> 32:34.255
Nice catch.

33:04.117 --> 33:05.350
Bye.

33:13.626 --> 33:15.194
These are friends.

33:18.665 --> 33:20.166
Good work, Sergeant.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.668
Gentlemen. Good
to have you back.

33:22.703 --> 33:23.836
No kidding.

33:23.871 --> 33:25.738
Captain, let's
get you to a hospital.

33:25.773 --> 33:27.006
Yes, ma'am.

33:27.041 --> 33:30.143
Colonel, this is
Iman Zubedah.

33:30.178 --> 33:33.279
Doctor, I'm Colonel Grant,
British Military Intelligence.

33:33.313 --> 33:36.527
This is Major Ashkani,
Pakistani ISI.

33:36.552 --> 33:38.779
He's here to guarantee
your safety.

33:38.919 --> 33:41.354
I'm so sorry we missed
our appointment.

33:42.623 --> 33:44.790
Me too.

33:44.825 --> 33:47.225
Please. We should let the
medics check you over.

33:47.260 --> 33:48.460
Thank you.

33:49.962 --> 33:51.162
Come, it's okay.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.366
It's all right.

33:56.402 --> 33:57.803
And Latif?

33:58.838 --> 34:00.072
Job done, Colonel.

34:15.389 --> 34:17.091
This is what you
wanted, isn't it?

34:18.126 --> 34:22.097
Latif dead?
I'm glad for you.

34:22.130 --> 34:23.297
And you?

34:23.331 --> 34:25.601
Twelve hostages killed,
at last count.

34:26.469 --> 34:28.004
Three of my men.

34:28.038 --> 34:30.139
I will be hung
in the press,

34:30.174 --> 34:32.041
denounced by
the politicians,

34:32.076 --> 34:33.810
forced to retire,
no doubt.

34:34.678 --> 34:36.112
And your conscience?

34:41.618 --> 34:42.818
It's clear.

34:44.587 --> 34:46.337
<i>The kitchen's</i>
<i>a disaster.</i>

34:46.623 --> 34:48.288
<i> These idiots</i>
<i>completely destroyed it.</i>

34:48.291 --> 34:49.864
I told them we had a contract,

34:49.889 --> 34:52.347
now I can't find it. I've
checked everywhere.

34:52.362 --> 34:53.929
The drawer, upstairs...

34:53.963 --> 34:56.197
<i>I must have thrown it out when</i>
<i>I was clearing up and...</i>

34:56.232 --> 35:02.003
Oh God, listen
to me, ranting about cabinets.

35:02.037 --> 35:03.798
I'm sorry, darling. It's
probably the last thing you

35:03.823 --> 35:05.023
want to hear right now.

35:05.807 --> 35:07.007
No.

35:08.476 --> 35:10.844
No, no, it's...

35:10.878 --> 35:13.247
I think it's exactly what I
need to be hearing right now.

35:15.550 --> 35:16.818
Michael,

35:18.487 --> 35:19.988
<i>when are you coming home?</i>

35:24.294 --> 35:27.430
<i>So what will</i>
<i>happen with Zubedah now?</i>

35:27.464 --> 35:29.753
I'm to accompany her to an
Indian Army facility,

35:29.778 --> 35:31.510
where she'll be questioned.

35:31.802 --> 35:33.803
We'll share what we learn
with you. Every word.

35:35.172 --> 35:36.806
Thank you, Major Ashkani.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.574
It's been a
pleasure, Colonel.

35:46.883 --> 35:47.950
Driver.

35:51.654 --> 35:52.854
It's okay.

36:01.996 --> 36:03.396
How long before
face recognition?

36:03.431 --> 36:04.631
Five,
ten minutes most.

36:04.665 --> 36:05.899
- Captain.
- Hi.

36:05.933 --> 36:06.966
Looking good.

36:07.001 --> 36:09.035
Thank you.

36:09.069 --> 36:10.937
Colonel.

36:10.972 --> 36:12.305
You're immune
to my charms?

36:12.340 --> 36:13.373
Isn't everyone?

36:14.509 --> 36:15.810
Your turn.

36:15.844 --> 36:17.412
Yeah, thanks for warming
the seat, buddy.

36:20.750 --> 36:22.551
What's that?

36:22.585 --> 36:23.950
It's a list of my
requirements if I'm gonna

36:23.975 --> 36:25.375
come work for Section 20.

36:27.057 --> 36:28.791
Work for Section 20?

36:28.826 --> 36:32.161
I want a salary that's
competitive with top-tier PMCs,

36:32.195 --> 36:33.893
living allowance,
and private health

36:33.918 --> 36:35.118
insurance, of course,

36:35.132 --> 36:38.762
unlimited expenses, and
business-class travel twice

36:38.787 --> 36:40.134
a year back to the States.

36:40.271 --> 36:43.573
Oh, and there's a couple of debt
collectors I'd like paid off, too.

36:45.176 --> 36:47.144
Hmm. So, is that all?

36:47.178 --> 36:50.047
No. But the rest of
it is in that folder.

36:51.050 --> 36:53.050
Need I remind you, Mr. Scott,

36:53.085 --> 36:55.602
that you were dishonorably
discharged from the

36:55.627 --> 36:56.821
United States military,

36:56.822 --> 36:59.204
and that you are considered
unemployable, even by the

36:59.229 --> 37:01.040
private military contractors?

37:01.227 --> 37:03.362
True.

37:03.397 --> 37:05.372
But need I remind you that I
practically handed Latif to

37:05.397 --> 37:06.332
you on a silver platter?

37:06.333 --> 37:08.068
You were brought in
to identify Latif,

37:08.102 --> 37:10.470
a man whom it turned out
you'd never even seen.

37:10.505 --> 37:12.472
Well now you've seen him.

37:12.507 --> 37:14.346
And me and your boy back there
saved the lives of all those hostages.

37:14.347 --> 37:16.496
Sergeant Stonebridge briefed
us on your contributions,

37:16.583 --> 37:17.744
and we greatly appreciate them.

37:17.745 --> 37:19.751
Oh, You appreciate my
contributions.

37:19.776 --> 37:20.714
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:20.715 --> 37:23.484
That hotel would have gone up in
flames if it weren't for us!

37:25.487 --> 37:27.139
Let me tell you about
the conditions under

37:27.164 --> 37:28.664
which I would consider

37:28.690 --> 37:32.460
offering you employment
at Section 20.

37:32.494 --> 37:37.031
You are to be paid at scale, with
no extra privileges whatsoever.

37:37.065 --> 37:39.834
You are to follow every
order you are given to the T,

37:39.868 --> 37:43.318
and maintain proper
military discipline and

37:43.343 --> 37:45.174
respect at all times.

37:47.209 --> 37:50.445
And you are to stop hitting on
every woman within arm's length,

37:50.479 --> 37:53.581
or I will prosecute you
for sexual harassment.

37:53.616 --> 37:55.776
I don't think you'll get a
better offer, or,

37:55.801 --> 37:58.807
indeed, any offer
anywhere else.

38:02.358 --> 38:03.558
Deal.

38:04.593 --> 38:05.660
Thanks.

38:07.997 --> 38:10.231
Could we be making a mistake?

38:10.266 --> 38:11.766
Oh, quite possibly.

38:13.268 --> 38:15.103
I'm in, buddy.

38:15.137 --> 38:16.804
Well, well. Wonders
never cease.

38:16.838 --> 38:18.472
You're just jealous
'cause she wants me.

38:18.507 --> 38:19.607
Come on, I'll
buy you a drink.

38:19.641 --> 38:20.807
Deal.

38:20.842 --> 38:22.242
I need to talk to you about
something first, though.

38:22.276 --> 38:23.977
Okay.
Stonebridge? Scott?

38:26.313 --> 38:27.972
This is the man from the
hotel, isn't it?

38:27.997 --> 38:29.697
The man that we think is Latif?

38:29.783 --> 38:31.450
That's right.
Yeah.

38:31.484 --> 38:34.686
According to the GCHQ database,
this man is Abasi Sawalha.

38:34.721 --> 38:37.602
He's the leader of an obscure
Yemeni terror group thought to

38:37.627 --> 38:39.027
be sympathetic to Latif.

38:39.092 --> 38:41.660
If that ain't Latif,
then who the fuck is?

38:41.694 --> 38:43.128
Colonel!

39:08.589 --> 39:10.524
Is this right?

39:10.558 --> 39:12.091
I don't know.

39:12.126 --> 39:13.593
I've not been to
the base before.

39:16.330 --> 39:17.664
This isn't right.

39:26.973 --> 39:27.973
What's going on?

39:35.228 --> 39:36.728
What's going on?
What's going on? Tell me!

39:38.452 --> 39:40.120
Shit.

39:40.154 --> 39:41.888
What's going on?
Why are we stopping?

39:43.191 --> 39:44.392
Fuck!

39:44.426 --> 39:46.227
Why are we stopping?
Why are we stopping!

39:46.262 --> 39:47.462
Ahhh!

39:51.868 --> 39:54.804
You will tell me everything
I need to know.

40:02.047 --> 40:03.648
Who's
the dead guy?

40:04.817 --> 40:06.852
That's the real
Major Ashkani.

40:28.305 --> 40:30.873
<i>Learn from this.</i>

40:31.841 --> 40:34.342
Latif outmaneuvered us all.

40:39.416 --> 40:41.984
<i>I brought him here,</i>
<i>into the crib.</i>

40:46.556 --> 40:49.191
<i>And delivered Mahmood</i>
<i>right to him.</i>

40:51.728 --> 40:54.296
Remember it, his victory.

40:55.966 --> 40:58.568
It will not happen again.

41:06.577 --> 41:09.078
<i>It will not happen again.</i>

41:32.935 --> 41:34.069
You going somewhere?

41:34.103 --> 41:35.504
Mmm.

41:35.538 --> 41:37.539
Hmm?
Yeah.

41:37.574 --> 41:40.142
Why? We still
have time.

41:44.916 --> 41:47.217
We can't do this anymore.

41:47.252 --> 41:49.353
Michael, we've
spoken about this.

41:49.388 --> 41:50.554
I know.

41:51.690 --> 41:53.991
But Kerry and I
are trying to...

41:54.025 --> 41:56.249
You were kids when you met.
You didn't even know who you

41:56.274 --> 41:57.839
were, you said so yourself.

42:04.236 --> 42:05.670
That doesn't change anything.

42:08.641 --> 42:10.408
I love you.

42:10.442 --> 42:11.409
Stop.

42:11.443 --> 42:13.044
You love me.
Stop.

42:14.913 --> 42:16.647
We both need to just stop.

42:18.884 --> 42:20.384
You sure you can?

42:38.671 --> 42:40.205
Michael...

43:02.696 --> 43:04.964
Hey, buddy.
Hi.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.367
So, what are we
doing back here?

43:07.401 --> 43:09.202
Like to rub salt
in the wound?

43:09.236 --> 43:11.871
I wanted to talk to
you outside the crib.

43:11.905 --> 43:13.740
What about?

43:13.774 --> 43:15.774
John Porter.

43:15.809 --> 43:17.910
He could have coded that
message a dozen different ways

43:17.944 --> 43:21.547
Section 20 could have recognized,
but he didn't, did he?

43:21.581 --> 43:23.686
He used a code only one
other person in the world

43:23.711 --> 43:25.263
knew about, and that was you.

43:26.119 --> 43:28.354
Why?

43:28.388 --> 43:30.542
Porter wanted you inside
the Section,

43:30.567 --> 43:32.248
but I'm fucked if I know why.

43:34.361 --> 43:35.761
Yes you do.

43:42.935 --> 43:44.235
<i>...sad fucking pricks!</i>

43:50.275 --> 43:52.043
Porter didn't trust
Section 20?

43:54.546 --> 43:56.246
Got it in one, buddy.

43:56.280 --> 43:57.680
I can't believe that.

43:57.715 --> 43:59.727
Come on. You and Kate

43:59.752 --> 44:01.539
had John's position in
Lahore, right?

44:02.352 --> 44:04.686
<i>Bring me Latif's</i>
<i>head on a plate.</i>

44:04.721 --> 44:06.454
<i>We're clear!</i>

44:06.489 --> 44:08.156
<i>They've moved him.</i>

44:08.190 --> 44:10.730
Only, Latif moved just
before you got there.

44:10.731 --> 44:11.791
How did he know?

44:11.794 --> 44:12.565
This is insane.

44:12.566 --> 44:14.524
Whoever sold John out
has eyes on section 20,
No.

44:14.525 --> 44:15.264
No.

44:15.265 --> 44:17.032
or someone connected to section 20.
No.

44:17.067 --> 44:19.669
Either way works out
to the same thing.

44:19.703 --> 44:22.138
<i>Shit.</i>
<i>All right. Kyle...</i>

44:22.173 --> 44:24.007
We lost a good
man that night!

44:30.349 --> 44:31.482
<i>John Porter.</i>

44:31.516 --> 44:32.716
Fuck.

44:36.220 --> 44:37.520
Latif knew John's name.

44:37.555 --> 44:39.289
Think John would have
given that up?

44:39.323 --> 44:41.290
No.

44:41.325 --> 44:44.159
There's something more.

44:44.193 --> 44:46.361
You didn't beg Grant for
a job just to get back

44:46.386 --> 44:47.586
to soldiering, did you?

44:48.164 --> 44:51.699
Zubedah told me about a
plot to plant WMDs in Iraq.

44:51.734 --> 44:55.017
<i>The organization</i>
<i>who hid those weapons can't</i>

44:55.042 --> 44:56.242
<i>afford for anyone to know.</i>

44:58.006 --> 45:01.416
John knew whoever set
him up, the WMDs, Latif,

45:01.441 --> 45:03.374
Mahmood, Project Dawn,

45:03.375 --> 45:06.344
the whole fucking conspiracy
somehow connects back with

45:06.369 --> 45:07.798
what happened to me in Iraq.

45:11.053 --> 45:12.253
Hmm.

45:19.229 --> 45:21.080
You don't want to prove all
this just to end up with a

45:21.105 --> 45:22.630
bullet in your brain, do you?

45:24.101 --> 45:26.202
Not really, no.

45:27.738 --> 45:30.006
Sounds like you need someone
to watch your back, mate.

45:32.810 --> 45:34.210
So do you, buddy.

45:35.679 --> 45:37.079
So do you.

45:42.151 --> 45:43.384
Come on.
