02:00.120 --> 02:01.411
Hello...

02:02.288 --> 02:03.956
Tackleberry.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.378
We're all gonna miss you around here.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.549
The Police Academy's getting itself
a real fine recruit.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.095
May I...

02:18.471 --> 02:20.013
go now?

02:21.307 --> 02:22.808
Affirmative, sir.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.061
Ten-four.

02:26.229 --> 02:29.439
Yes, of course. Ten-four.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.894
You guys.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.813
Surprise.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.194
Lot's full, mister.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.573
Look, don't give me that crap.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.660
- You've got a space.
- The lot's full, sir, really.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.079
Find a spot, dickhead.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.249
- Dickhead?
- That's right. Where's the manager?

04:10.416 --> 04:11.583
Dickhead?

04:11.751 --> 04:13.835
Park the car, butt breath.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.171
- Butt breath?
- Yeah.

04:17.173 --> 04:20.341
Wait a minute. Hold everything.
That's a wig, isn't it?

04:20.510 --> 04:22.719
- Ahem. Park the car.
- Yeah, that's a wig.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.305
Wig! Wig! Dong-dong-dong!

04:25.473 --> 04:28.267
- Wig alert! Wig alert! Dong-dong-dong!
- Park the car, asshole. Shut up.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.227
Girls. It's a rug.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.980
What the hell's going on here? Hi, Lou.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.650
- Lou?
- This rude little punk won't park my car.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.527
Mahoney, park this car.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.028
If you can find a spot...

04:40.196 --> 04:43.365
Do it now or you're fired.
You understand? Fired.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.827
Fired? That's not fair,
the guy has a bad attitude.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.412
Do it, okay?

04:48.579 --> 04:52.457
I want you to apologize to this man,
then park his car.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.211
Yes, sir.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.549
- I'm sorry.
- Get out of here.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.634
And clean the ashtray while you're at it.

05:08.933 --> 05:12.102
Yeah, I'm sorry, Lou. You just can't get
good help these days.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.565
- Respect for anything.
- They don't respect customers.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.609
They don't respect property.
They don't respect respect.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.488
Holy shit. Jesus.

05:30.204 --> 05:33.081
It fits. Damn thing fits.

05:33.249 --> 05:36.668
I thought there were no more spaces.
Am I an idiot or what?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.384
Hi, fellas.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.644
Hey, guys, just...

05:55.730 --> 05:57.189
Hey, hey!

06:13.122 --> 06:15.665
Guys, I don't think I'm supposed
to get the photos wet.

06:25.009 --> 06:28.428
You're going to pay for this.
Mark my words.

06:28.596 --> 06:31.723
And you want to know why?

06:36.062 --> 06:39.648
I'll let you know why. It's no secret.
Everybody knows.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.150
I'm joining the police force. Ha, ha!

06:42.318 --> 06:44.486
What do you think of that?

06:44.654 --> 06:46.113
Now who's in charge?

06:53.579 --> 06:55.831
Hey, sarge, it's him again.

06:55.998 --> 06:58.458
I'll call Captain Reed.
Sit over there, Mahoney.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.293
All right, let's go.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.467
Sit. And stay there.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.481
- What are you in for?
- I'll show you.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.530
Goddamn it! Stop that!

07:28.698 --> 07:30.157
Oh, no, sir. No, not you.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.075
That's terrific. Really.

07:32.660 --> 07:36.371
- What's your name?
- Jones. Larvell Jones.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.957
Monsignor Larvell Jones.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.208
M.D.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.502
- Let's go, Mahoney.
- See you around, monsignor.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.046
Doctor monsignor.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.393
Why can't you stay out of trouble?

07:58.728 --> 08:00.187
I mean...

08:01.606 --> 08:04.566
What's wrong with you?
Last week: Disturbing the peace.

08:04.734 --> 08:08.403
Week before that:
Destroying private property.

08:08.571 --> 08:12.240
And I'm getting tired of saving your butt.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.203
I only do it because of your father.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.540
- He was a good friend.
- Yeah, I know.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.251
Now, Mahoney, I've made a decision.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.795
I ain't gonna help you this time.

08:25.963 --> 08:28.840
You're going to the county lockup.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.884
- Lockup?
- Mm-hm.

08:31.052 --> 08:35.013
Why? I didn't do anything really major.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.974
- Then I'll make a deal with you.
- Anything.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.977
I want you to go to the Police Academy.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.938
The Police Academy?

08:43.105 --> 08:46.149
Even if you never graduate,
the training will be good for you.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.859
Wait a minute.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.986
Wait a minute. Reed?

08:50.154 --> 08:53.698
Listen, you've seen the commercials
on TV.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.661
The Academy's taking
all kinds these days.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.455
Anybody can get in.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.874
Even you.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.377
No deal. That's nuts.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.296
Well, it's either that or the lockup.

09:08.714 --> 09:12.133
- Police Academy or jail.
- Will I get my own squad car?

09:12.301 --> 09:15.971
You'll get 14 weeks of Academy training
and discipline...

09:16.138 --> 09:19.224
- Starting Monday morning.
- Fourteen weeks.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.601
Oh, they can throw you out.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.688
But you can't quit.
You quit, and you're back in jail.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.940
That's the deal.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.442
- Can I bring a friend?
- Who?

09:29.610 --> 09:31.736
Monsignor Larvell Jones,
my personal physician.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.739
You decide.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.077
Honey, please don't go. I love you.
I don't want to see you hurt.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.496
I worry about you.
You're so accident-prone.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.124
And the Police Academy
is such a dangerous place.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.711
Honey, don't worry. I'll be okay.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.254
Everything'll be okay.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.798
You start that car
and you're a dead man, buster.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.341
Honey, I'm late.

09:53.509 --> 09:57.846
You pull out of that driveway
and I'll have your head on a pole.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.934
Come back here, you turkey!

10:33.299 --> 10:37.344
You move this car an inch
and you're finished, mister. You hear me?

10:44.977 --> 10:49.397
Of all the things that you could be
in this world, why a policeman?

10:49.565 --> 10:52.734
A policewoman, mother.

10:54.111 --> 10:55.153
But why?

10:55.321 --> 10:57.489
Because it's exciting, it's different.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.241
It'll give me a chance to meet
interesting and unusual people.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.410
Right now! If you don't pull over...

11:02.578 --> 11:05.163
People who aren't like you and me.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.626
- Hey, look, it's the chief.
- Really?

11:51.794 --> 11:53.461
Hey, mention my name.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.593
Cadet Kyle Blankes
reporting for duty, sir.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.887
Get away from me, you asshole.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.389
Yes, sir.

12:22.825 --> 12:26.119
- Where are we, man?
- Ecuador.

12:29.915 --> 12:34.461
Okay! Oh, here we are.
I got to go now. Bye.

12:34.628 --> 12:37.797
- Bye, sweet-pea. Bye, cutie-pie.
- We'll miss you.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.341
- Okay.
- Bye!

12:40.509 --> 12:44.053
Okay, girls. Remember, I love yous.

12:44.221 --> 12:47.015
- Bye!
- Introduce yourself around, man.

12:49.935 --> 12:53.480
Bye! Bye, babies. Goodbye.

12:54.857 --> 12:55.899
Hey, excuse me.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.692
- Do you know all those women?
- Sure.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.611
- They're my girlfriends.
- All of them?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.571
- Yeah.
- Carey Mahoney.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.239
I'm George Martin, Carey.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.575
We should be pals.
You're an interesting guy.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.202
You a cadet?

13:07.369 --> 13:09.496
I am until I can get myself
thrown out of here.

13:09.663 --> 13:10.705
I'll be gone by 10:00.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.374
You, like, joined the Academy
to get thrown out?

13:13.542 --> 13:14.584
That's right.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.504
Hey, you're a pretty interesting guy
yourself.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.681
Look at that.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.643
Just look at that.

13:32.144 --> 13:35.855
Look at that scum.
When I went through this academy...

13:36.023 --> 13:38.900
every cadet was the right weight,
the right height, color...

13:39.068 --> 13:41.611
and they all had Johnsons, Lassard.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.947
Every single one of them.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.156
Johnsons?

13:45.324 --> 13:47.575
You know...

13:48.911 --> 13:50.495
Oh, yes.

13:51.330 --> 13:55.542
Back in the old days, there were Johnsons
as far as the eye could see.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.586
And what a lovely sight it was.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.923
Have you seen these applications?

14:03.676 --> 14:07.303
Have you seen what our new lady mayor
has brought us?

14:07.471 --> 14:09.597
Do you know she is attempting
to dismantle...

14:09.765 --> 14:13.184
one of this country's great institutions
of law and order?

14:13.352 --> 14:15.770
What do you say to that, Lassard?

14:16.355 --> 14:17.939
The bitch.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.150
- Commandant?
- Yes, chief.

14:21.318 --> 14:24.946
The mayor says we've got
to take this flotsam.

14:25.114 --> 14:28.783
But that doesn't mean
we have to put them on the force.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.743
You get my drift?

14:30.911 --> 14:34.455
Weed the undesirables out.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.125
- Get rid of them.
- No problem, chief.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.210
We'll start washing them out
this morning.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.087
We don't throw them out.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.591
They must be encouraged to quit
on their own.

14:44.758 --> 14:48.761
- Do you understand?
- I think I understand, sir.

14:48.929 --> 14:52.432
Thank you, Lieutenant Harris,
I'm sure you do.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.226
- Lassard?
- What?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.562
Do you understand?

14:57.730 --> 15:00.732
- It's clear as glass, chief.
- Good.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.610
Then we all know what to do.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.554
That's it...

15:32.932 --> 15:35.642
There sure are a lot
of spades around here.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.276
Which I think is good.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.612
Very good for the Academy.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.490
What the hell are you doing here?

15:51.367 --> 15:53.743
I want to be a police officer.

15:53.911 --> 15:57.872
What? I can't hear you.

15:58.624 --> 16:02.377
I want to be a police officer.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.173
- Don't unpack.
- Well...

16:07.341 --> 16:09.217
time to get thrown out.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.137
Princess. Princess! Prin...!

16:14.974 --> 16:17.058
- What's your name, Cadet?
- Thompson, sir.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.851
- You live around here?
- No, sir.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.937
What's your telephone number,
Thompson?

16:21.105 --> 16:23.398
Come on, eyes front. Telephone number.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.900
5-5-52-4-6-7, sir.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.987
Okay, let's see the thighs.

16:29.154 --> 16:33.241
Come on, come on. I haven't got all day.
The thighs.

16:34.868 --> 16:37.996
- What in the hell are you doing?
- Meeting women, sir.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.623
What's your name, dirtbag?

16:40.791 --> 16:42.875
- Dirtbag?
- Your name?

16:43.043 --> 16:44.711
Mahoney, sir.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.129
Back in line, Mahoney.

16:46.296 --> 16:49.549
Sir, can I have a second with you?
Listen.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.801
I don't really belong here.
I'm not right for this.

16:51.969 --> 16:56.556
Get back in line.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.434
Now!

17:00.936 --> 17:04.105
Mom, it's all right. Don't worry.
Come here, Princess.

17:34.803 --> 17:38.973
My name is Commandant Lassard.
Welcome to the new police force.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.268
Your training time here will last...

17:43.479 --> 17:44.979
Fourteen.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.106
Fourteen weeks.

17:47.274 --> 17:51.569
You will be schooled in firearms,
police procedures, local laws...

17:51.737 --> 17:53.613
and many, many other things.

17:53.781 --> 17:57.158
After those 12 weeks,
some of you will be police officers...

17:57.326 --> 17:58.910
and some of you will not.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.328
Some of you will be...

18:02.164 --> 18:03.706
Here at the Academy...

18:05.000 --> 18:06.793
Here at the Academy...

18:06.960 --> 18:08.753
you will learn...

18:08.921 --> 18:10.546
You will learn...

18:11.590 --> 18:13.091
Princess. Princess. Come here.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.551
Princess?
Looks more like a prince to me.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.306
- Give me that dog.
- Ahem. But he's mine, sir.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.682
He's a queer.

18:21.850 --> 18:26.437
Cadets, proceed to the supply room
and draw your uniforms.

18:26.605 --> 18:30.733
Fall out. Let's go. Move it.
Move it, move it, move it.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.658
- Next.
- What about guns? When do we get guns?

18:38.826 --> 18:40.326
Next.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.372
- I'm a size 9, sometimes a size 10.
- Next.

18:52.798 --> 18:56.425
Hey! You three dirtbags report
to the Academy barber...

18:56.593 --> 18:58.094
before you do anything else.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.679
Where's that?

18:59.847 --> 19:02.265
Find it, rat face.

19:02.432 --> 19:03.808
Rat face?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.894
- He probably meant the other guy.
- Oh. Oh, okay.

19:07.062 --> 19:09.147
- What's that?
- That's where the commandant...

19:09.314 --> 19:11.399
- And his wife live.
- Nice.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.985
Oh. Excuse me.
Do you know where we get our clothes?

19:14.153 --> 19:17.238
Yeah. You gotta go right over there.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.906
- Here? Okay, thanks.
- Mm-hm.

19:19.074 --> 19:22.118
- Go in and tell them Mahoney sent you.
- Got it.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.997
- Be out of here by 3:00.
- Move it, dirtbag. I'm first.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.249
And I'm next.

19:29.126 --> 19:32.795
For important guys like you, I'll wait.

19:36.216 --> 19:39.093
Okay, let's go. Take it all off.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.469
You got it.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.154
Hello?

20:26.975 --> 20:32.313
- Just a little off the side, please.
- You bet.

20:32.481 --> 20:36.817
- You can do that?
- Sure. This ain't the Army, you know.

20:40.989 --> 20:45.826
Let's go, let's go! We've got to find
you little babies a place to sleep.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.704
Better listen up, you fart-blossoms.

20:48.872 --> 20:52.708
- You sure you said Mahoney?
- Yeah, I even spelled it to her.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.585
- Copeland and Blankes, in here.
- Sir.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.672
This man is my personal physician.
I can't live without him, sir.

20:57.839 --> 21:00.591
Right down here,
I want Fackler and Martin.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.343
I've known him since childhood...

21:02.511 --> 21:07.306
- Right here, Mahoney and Tackleberry.
- Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!

21:09.476 --> 21:11.435
Thank you.
I've always wanted to live with a nut.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.854
My pleasure.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.857
- Mahoney, is it?
- Yes, sir. I'd like to say one more...

21:17.025 --> 21:21.028
The rest of you wimps come with me.
Move it, move it, move it.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.488
Wimps?

21:27.077 --> 21:29.412
- You're married?
- Yeah.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.872
That's beautiful, man.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.208
To me, marriage is a sacred institution.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.711
So tell me.

21:36.878 --> 21:39.588
You and the wife do it doggie-style
or what?

21:56.481 --> 21:58.774
Room ready for inspection, sir.

22:00.610 --> 22:01.986
Good haircuts, men.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.030
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.407
Damn good haircuts.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.326
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.250
Men...

22:16.418 --> 22:18.627
I've got a little problem.

22:19.129 --> 22:22.715
It seems I've got a squad
full of scumbuckets.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.051
A whole big bunch of losers.

22:25.719 --> 22:29.138
And I was kind of hoping
that you two fine, young cadets...

22:29.973 --> 22:32.933
might help me to just get rid of
a few of them.

22:33.477 --> 22:37.396
What do you say?
Will you help me out?

22:38.690 --> 22:41.442
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

22:43.570 --> 22:47.656
- Good.
- I'm Copeland, sir. Chad Copeland.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.159
Good for you.

22:53.246 --> 22:56.332
Hi, I'm Douglas Fackler.
I always wanted to be a cop.

23:12.724 --> 23:15.017
Lieutenant Hoffman, Lieutenant Hoffman...

23:15.185 --> 23:17.269
report immediately to the infirmary.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.814
Hey, Thompson. Well?

23:19.981 --> 23:22.650
- How do I look?
- That wasn't very funny this morning.

23:22.818 --> 23:25.319
Wasn't funny.
I'd give anything to see your thighs.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.571
Don't suppose you'd
describe them for me.

23:27.739 --> 23:32.284
Well, they're tan, of course.
Very supple, well-rounded...

23:32.452 --> 23:35.329
and luxuriant to the touch.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.580
Mm.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.583
Absolute silence!

23:44.798 --> 23:49.176
My name is Lt. Harris...

23:49.344 --> 23:51.720
in case you missed it.

23:55.642 --> 23:59.061
This is Sgt. Callahan...

23:59.229 --> 24:01.397
in case you missed it.

24:01.565 --> 24:05.693
We are the meanest instructors here.

24:05.861 --> 24:11.782
We've got you because
you are the worst people here.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.579
You people are D-Squad.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.290
D for dirtbags.

24:19.458 --> 24:24.378
When I say, "Hey, dirtbags,"
that means you.

24:24.546 --> 24:29.049
You people are going to hate my guts
for the rest of your lives.

24:29.217 --> 24:34.305
I am going to make you sorry
that you ever came here.

24:34.681 --> 24:38.476
Now, it is traditional here at the Academy
for each squad...

24:38.643 --> 24:41.020
to have two student squad-leaders.

24:41.188 --> 24:46.025
I have chosen Cadets Blankes
and Dopeland. Step out, men.

24:46.735 --> 24:50.237
If these two cadets give you an order...

24:50.822 --> 24:54.074
obey it.

24:55.785 --> 24:59.246
Now, I thought it would be nice...

24:59.414 --> 25:03.292
if we were to close out
our first afternoon together...

25:03.460 --> 25:07.671
with a nice little stroll
around the campus.

25:12.844 --> 25:16.347
Move out, maggots!

25:22.854 --> 25:26.941
- Holy, shit.
- This is definitely not Ecuador.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.947
Get up, Barbara. Get up. Get up.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.615
Move it, move it, move it.

25:34.783 --> 25:38.244
I could show a movie on your butt, fatso.

25:38.411 --> 25:40.913
Nineteen. Twenty!

25:42.874 --> 25:46.919
More! I want more!

25:47.087 --> 25:49.547
Fifteen.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.757
Sixteen.

25:51.925 --> 25:54.134
Seventeen.

25:54.302 --> 25:59.098
Eighteen. Let's go. Let's go.

25:59.266 --> 26:03.477
Nine. Ten.

26:06.356 --> 26:09.525
Attention. Lights out in 10 minutes.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.653
Lights out in 10 minutes.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.064
Game over.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.659
Asshole.

27:00.910 --> 27:04.663
Police work...

27:04.831 --> 27:07.875
is what...

27:08.043 --> 27:10.210
you are...

27:10.378 --> 27:14.381
here for.

27:15.175 --> 27:18.177
Arrest...

27:18.345 --> 27:22.848
procedures...

27:23.016 --> 27:27.561
traffic violations...

27:27.729 --> 27:30.022
high-speed...

27:30.190 --> 27:32.358
driving...

27:32.525 --> 27:34.610
self-defense.

27:34.778 --> 27:40.532
And you will have many examinations...

27:40.700 --> 27:44.244
which you must pass.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.497
Plus...

27:46.998 --> 27:51.377
you will endure an extremely rigorous
physical training program.

27:51.544 --> 27:54.588
Do you know what that means, Hooks?

27:55.882 --> 27:58.217
I'm not sure, sir.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.010
What?

28:02.514 --> 28:04.807
Voice commands.

28:04.974 --> 28:08.936
We will learn to use our voices
with authority.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.105
Won't we, Hooks?

28:14.442 --> 28:19.780
Now, have any of you
had any military training?

28:22.784 --> 28:23.784
Mm-hm?

28:23.952 --> 28:28.288
I served with the U.S. Army
Airborne 209th Special Forces Unit.

28:28.665 --> 28:30.082
Anybody else?

28:30.250 --> 28:31.542
What?

28:32.252 --> 28:35.838
You have had prior
military training, Mahoney?

28:36.005 --> 28:39.174
- Well, yes, but not in this life, sir.
- What?

28:39.342 --> 28:42.386
In a previous life, I served
with Her Majesty's Forces in India.

28:42.554 --> 28:46.223
- Interesting sideline...
- If you're trying to get thrown out...

28:46.391 --> 28:48.559
I'm afraid that's quite impossible.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.103
Impossible?
What the hell's going on here?

28:51.271 --> 28:53.272
I'll have to see
the commandant about this.

28:53.440 --> 28:59.611
You will also learn the Municipal Code.
And you will learn them by heart.

29:00.196 --> 29:01.613
Cadet Mahoney. Cadet Mahoney.

29:01.781 --> 29:05.534
Report immediately to the commandant's
office. Cadet Mahoney.

29:05.702 --> 29:11.665
Okay, Mahoney, get going. On the double.
Move it. Move it. Move it.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.002
Now...

29:15.170 --> 29:16.962
Lieutenant Harris, Lieutenant Harris...

29:17.130 --> 29:20.048
report immediately to the firing range.
Lieutenant Harris.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.677
Excuse me.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.471
Callahan, take over.

29:28.808 --> 29:30.309
Howdy.

29:30.643 --> 29:32.978
- No one's allowed in here.
- Listen.

29:33.146 --> 29:35.522
- I got a problem, chief.
- It's commandant.

29:35.690 --> 29:38.525
Commandant, I'm sorry.
Is that your fish?

29:38.693 --> 29:40.819
- No, it belongs to a friend.
- Very pretty.

29:40.987 --> 29:43.614
- What do you want?
- I want out of here. Right now.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.909
- Out of this office?
- No, out of the Academy.

29:47.076 --> 29:49.995
- That's no problem. You can just quit.
- I can't quit.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.873
Of course you can.
Many, many wonderful people...

29:53.041 --> 29:55.083
- Have quit many, many...
- Commandant?

29:55.668 --> 29:57.169
Do you know Capt. Reed?

29:57.337 --> 30:01.924
Oh, yes. Capt. Reed. You're Mahoney.

30:03.718 --> 30:07.262
Mahoney. Mahoney. Mahoney.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.266
- You're a special case. You can't quit.
- I know that.

30:11.434 --> 30:14.561
- On the other hand, I can't throw you out.
- Why not?

30:14.729 --> 30:18.732
I promised Capt. Reed. I promised
I'd keep you here the full 24 weeks.

30:19.526 --> 30:23.028
You what? You what? You told...?

30:23.196 --> 30:25.781
He told me that I could...

30:27.909 --> 30:31.578
- I'm trapped here?
- Well, yes. We all are.

30:33.289 --> 30:36.208
Pick it up, pick it up.
Keep moving up that hill.

30:38.503 --> 30:39.920
Put some muscle in it.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.923
Get those knees up.
Get those knees up, come on!

30:54.602 --> 30:55.978
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

30:56.145 --> 30:57.980
This is definitely not for me.

31:03.778 --> 31:04.862
Keep going!

31:17.709 --> 31:22.796
Come on, Hooks, get over the wall.
Move it, move it, move it.

31:23.590 --> 31:26.675
Come on, Hooks, get up.

31:26.843 --> 31:30.846
Skip it. Go around. You'll never make it.
Why don't you quit now?

31:31.014 --> 31:33.932
Quit, quit, quit. You'll never make it.

31:34.100 --> 31:39.146
Sir, I'm terribly sorry,
but I seem to have ripped my pants.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.361
Don't try me, punk.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.781
Now, wise guy...

31:49.949 --> 31:52.034
you run, don't trot...

31:52.201 --> 31:56.538
to the supply room,
and you get a new pair.

31:57.206 --> 31:59.625
Yes, sir. I'll be back later in the day.

31:59.792 --> 32:03.170
Be back in five minutes!

32:03.338 --> 32:06.173
Yes, sir. Shit, I'm deaf.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.353
Hey, you got any brown shoe-polish?

32:19.520 --> 32:21.104
I've got cordovan. Who's it for?

32:21.272 --> 32:23.190
Lieutenant Harris.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.543
Sir! Look, sir, new pants.

32:43.711 --> 32:45.671
What are you doing...? Give me that.

32:45.838 --> 32:49.925
All right, you scumbags, you have
30 minutes to shower and get to class.

32:50.093 --> 32:52.678
Let's go. Move it. Move it. Move it.

32:52.845 --> 32:55.013
Pick it up. Pick it up.

32:55.181 --> 32:58.058
Pick it up, assholes.

33:05.858 --> 33:08.610
So far, nobody's quit.

33:08.778 --> 33:09.861
But they will.

33:33.761 --> 33:36.138
Well, well, well.

33:37.015 --> 33:40.100
I told you not to try me, boy.

33:41.269 --> 33:42.769
Stand up.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.649
Now, I want you two squad leaders...

33:47.817 --> 33:50.944
to take Mr. Mahoney here
and run him until he throws up.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.154
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

33:52.321 --> 33:55.532
And then, just after he throws up...

33:55.700 --> 33:57.034
run him some more.

33:57.201 --> 33:58.910
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

34:01.497 --> 34:04.374
You are going to learn, Mahoney...

34:04.792 --> 34:06.793
that nobody...

34:07.920 --> 34:10.130
nobody...

34:10.297 --> 34:12.466
screws...

34:13.051 --> 34:14.801
with me.

34:15.511 --> 34:18.013
- Pick it up, pick it up! Come on!
- Hey, this is great.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.973
- Two assholes, no waiting.
- Move it!

34:20.141 --> 34:23.560
Chad, would you please just let me
yell at him without interrupting?

34:23.728 --> 34:27.105
- Sure.
- Come on, Mahoney! Move it, move it!

35:16.823 --> 35:18.365
Bang!

35:28.501 --> 35:31.878
Son, where did you get this gun?

35:32.130 --> 35:35.006
My mom gave it to me.

35:35.174 --> 35:37.968
Can I borrow it for a little while?

35:38.136 --> 35:40.011
Sure.

35:41.556 --> 35:47.060
Left, left right left.
Left, left, left right left.

35:47.812 --> 35:53.900
You will learn to defend yourselves
without stick or firearm.

35:55.027 --> 35:56.570
I need a volunteer.

35:56.737 --> 35:59.823
- Barbara, get out here.
- I just ate.

35:59.991 --> 36:04.119
Right where I'm standing.
Right here. Right now.

36:06.706 --> 36:09.541
All right, come at me
with an imaginary knife.

36:09.709 --> 36:10.917
Do I have to?

36:11.085 --> 36:14.588
Yes, you do. I'm not joking.

36:14.755 --> 36:17.507
Come on. Come on.

36:17.675 --> 36:20.468
Now!

36:20.636 --> 36:22.888
Ouch! Ouch!

36:26.809 --> 36:30.478
Okay. That's how it's done. Who's next?

36:30.646 --> 36:32.772
- Pick me!
- I'd love it. I'd love to go.

36:32.940 --> 36:35.192
I'd love to go. We'll both go.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.611
You have 20 minutes
to complete the test.

36:37.778 --> 36:40.989
Try to answer as many questions
as possible.

36:41.157 --> 36:43.533
All right, start.

36:54.462 --> 36:58.506
All right, here we go.
The count's at two. Here's the pitch.

36:58.966 --> 37:00.383
Swung on and missed!

37:02.136 --> 37:03.845
Struck out.

37:17.818 --> 37:21.821
Well, it was Saturday night
And I was feeling all right

37:21.989 --> 37:23.823
Looking for my buttercup

37:24.951 --> 37:28.745
They were dancing next door
On the thirteenth floor

38:06.325 --> 38:07.742
You know, Mahoney...

38:07.910 --> 38:12.372
I'd like to spend the next month
breaking you into little pieces.

38:13.332 --> 38:14.958
But I won't...

38:15.167 --> 38:17.210
because you're bad.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.879
You're bad for morale, Mahoney.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.633
You look like the sweet little boy
from next door.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.011
Ha. But you don't fool me. Oh, no.

38:26.178 --> 38:29.556
No, you're the devil,
and you're rotten to the core.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.391
And you're ruining my chances...

38:31.559 --> 38:34.477
of training some men
who might make pretty good cops.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.229
I agree. I've been saying that.

38:36.397 --> 38:39.482
- You make me sick.
- Thank you, sir. I make everybody sick.

38:39.650 --> 38:43.403
We're going to pick up this telephone
and call your buddy Capt. Reed.

38:43.571 --> 38:48.074
And you. You are going to help me
talk him out of this terrible mistake.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.076
Terrific. I'll do my part.

38:50.244 --> 38:52.370
You're damn right you will.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.249
Ha.

38:59.754 --> 39:03.882
This is the Academy.
I'd like to speak to a Capt. Reed.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.926
Reed!

39:10.556 --> 39:13.892
Captain Reed? Yes, sir.
How are you, sir?

39:14.060 --> 39:17.937
This is Lt. Harris, Lt. Thaddeus Harris
out at the Police Academy.

39:18.105 --> 39:20.982
I'm so sorry to disturb you, sir...

39:21.150 --> 39:25.111
but your friend Cadet Mahoney
would like to speak with you.

39:25.279 --> 39:28.198
Just one moment, please. Mahoney.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.242
- Mahoney!
- Oh, yeah.

39:31.952 --> 39:34.454
Hi, Captain Reed? Can I get out of here?

39:34.622 --> 39:36.331
No? Okay.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.291
I tried.

39:40.044 --> 39:43.463
Captain Reed, thank you so much.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.382
Yes. Goodbye. Yes.

39:47.968 --> 39:50.095
I don't know
what you're trying to do.

39:50.262 --> 39:52.263
I don't know why you're here.

39:52.431 --> 39:55.225
But you'll never be a cop
as long as I live.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.185
- Don't want to be.
- Get your butt off my desk.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.270
And get out of here!

40:01.190 --> 40:02.816
Mahoney!

40:03.859 --> 40:05.693
I've already told you once.

40:05.861 --> 40:08.696
Nobody screws with me.

40:09.323 --> 40:12.158
Well, maybe you'll meet the right girl
and all that'll change.

40:12.326 --> 40:14.786
Get out of here now!

40:18.457 --> 40:21.209
Come on, Mahoney.
Harris said you had to do a hundred.

40:25.339 --> 40:26.631
Hey, Mahoney.

40:26.799 --> 40:29.843
Here's a pair of my old sweat socks.
I wore them all day.

40:30.010 --> 40:32.178
That should help you to get up.

40:41.188 --> 40:42.856
You did it.

40:43.899 --> 40:46.109
You son of a bitch.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.966
This is a hell of a way
to spend my evenings.

41:12.761 --> 41:14.679
I can't feel my arms anymore.

41:19.101 --> 41:21.102
Hey, Barbara, come here.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.770
- Me?
- Yeah, come here.

41:22.938 --> 41:25.315
- What?
- Come on, right here.

41:27.401 --> 41:29.486
- I want you to give me your best shot.
- What?

41:29.653 --> 41:31.112
I want you to hit me. Best shot.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.614
- Hit you?
- Yeah, come on.

41:32.781 --> 41:35.283
- Ha, ha. No, really, I...
- Hit me.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.577
- Really, when I...
- Do it now. Come on.

41:37.745 --> 41:40.663
- I can't. Because when I...
- Do it. Give me your...

41:41.165 --> 41:43.541
How was that? Was that okay?

41:44.418 --> 41:45.919
Yeah.

41:46.086 --> 41:48.171
Yeah, that's good.

41:53.802 --> 41:58.139
This weekend is your first leave
from the Academy.

41:58.307 --> 42:03.353
When you go, wherever it is
you filthbags go...

42:03.521 --> 42:07.607
do take note of how nice things are
on the outside.

42:07.775 --> 42:12.153
Do give serious consideration
to not coming back.

42:12.321 --> 42:14.447
Four of you have already quit.

42:14.615 --> 42:17.575
And that's just the beginning.

42:18.285 --> 42:20.578
Ten-hut!

42:21.121 --> 42:22.163
Dismissed.

42:22.331 --> 42:25.625
Heard him, dismissed! Let's go.

42:25.793 --> 42:29.587
They'll get together for a party.
They always do.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.631
You go with them.

42:32.132 --> 42:36.052
Whenever they get out of line,
give me a ring.

42:42.017 --> 42:44.227
Hi, Leslie.

42:46.105 --> 42:47.647
Studying hard?

42:48.148 --> 42:49.190
Yup.

42:49.483 --> 42:51.901
Where's the party going to be
this weekend?

42:52.069 --> 42:53.486
Party?

42:53.654 --> 42:55.780
Party? I don't know anything
about a party.

42:55.948 --> 42:58.491
I'm going home for the weekend
and visit my mom and dad.

42:58.659 --> 43:01.953
Now, if you don't mind,
I do have to study.

43:02.121 --> 43:05.873
You know, Chad?
I don't think we've got his full attention.

43:06.041 --> 43:09.544
So why don't you take his books
and throw them out the window?

43:09.712 --> 43:12.505
My pleasure, Kyle.

43:22.683 --> 43:25.059
Find out where the party is.

43:25.227 --> 43:28.062
- How?
- Ask Mahoney.

43:28.230 --> 43:30.440
- Mahoney.
- Mahoney.

43:30.608 --> 43:34.152
Thousand eleven, 1012, 1013...

43:35.738 --> 43:38.031
Mahoney.

43:38.198 --> 43:40.533
Could I speak to you outside
for just a second?

43:40.701 --> 43:42.201
Yeah.

43:45.164 --> 43:47.081
What's up?

43:47.249 --> 43:49.208
Mahoney.

43:50.794 --> 43:52.295
Is there a party this weekend?

43:52.671 --> 43:54.922
Yeah, of course there is.
Do you want to come?

43:55.090 --> 43:57.091
No. No, I can't.

43:58.052 --> 44:00.762
I just need to know where it is.
Sorry to be asking.

44:01.555 --> 44:02.847
Then why are you asking?

44:03.557 --> 44:06.059
Some people want to know.

44:06.226 --> 44:09.729
Okay, yeah. It's no big secret.
It's at the Blue Oyster bar.

44:09.897 --> 44:12.273
It's on Howell.

44:32.336 --> 44:34.379
Hey, big boy
Why don't you come up

44:34.546 --> 44:36.047
And see me sometime?

44:39.551 --> 44:41.511
Hey, big boy

44:59.530 --> 45:02.740
So, what about you, Hightower?
What are you doing at the Academy?

45:02.908 --> 45:05.076
I got bored with my chosen profession.

45:05.244 --> 45:07.870
- What was that?
- I was a florist.

45:08.038 --> 45:09.080
A florist?

45:09.248 --> 45:11.958
You know, flowers and shit.

45:12.793 --> 45:14.627
Oh, yeah.

46:06.930 --> 46:09.515
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:11.810 --> 46:15.605
- I didn't think you'd show up.
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

46:27.367 --> 46:30.286
Do you want to go for a walk?

46:30.454 --> 46:31.871
- Walk.
- Oh, yeah.

46:32.039 --> 46:34.040
Are you kidding? Of course.

46:54.019 --> 46:56.187
- Can you tell me something?
- Yeah?

46:56.396 --> 46:58.648
Why do you want to be a cop?

47:02.945 --> 47:05.738
I like to dress like a man.

47:07.366 --> 47:08.991
Me too.

47:12.704 --> 47:17.834
Tonight you're mine completely

47:19.670 --> 47:25.424
You give your love so sweetly

47:25.843 --> 47:32.807
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes

47:33.767 --> 47:39.605
But will you love me tomorrow?

47:40.858 --> 47:46.404
Is this a lasting treasure

47:47.865 --> 47:53.828
Or just a moment's pleasure?

48:04.756 --> 48:09.552
Okay, let's go. Move it. Move it. Let's go.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.601
Two lines, right here.

48:16.768 --> 48:19.520
The first one on the step,
the second one off.

48:22.357 --> 48:25.818
I said two lines, dummy!
Now step it up, step it up, let's go.

48:25.986 --> 48:27.236
Hey.

48:28.322 --> 48:30.656
Why didn't you call me this weekend?

48:33.327 --> 48:36.370
Well nothing really happened, sir.

48:36.538 --> 48:39.206
There was a party, wasn't there?

48:40.250 --> 48:41.751
Yes, sir.

48:42.336 --> 48:43.878
Well, what went on?

48:46.173 --> 48:48.007
Dancing, sir.

48:48.467 --> 48:49.634
Mostly dancing.

48:55.849 --> 48:57.099
Dancing?

49:01.772 --> 49:04.690
Hightower, you're first. Let's go.

49:14.993 --> 49:16.661
Come with me.

49:43.397 --> 49:45.231
Ready now, sir.

49:49.236 --> 49:51.696
Thank you.

49:52.698 --> 49:54.240
I got him.

50:01.039 --> 50:03.416
Tackleberry. You're next.

50:18.432 --> 50:19.932
Come with me.

50:26.648 --> 50:29.692
- Hey!
- Tackleberry!

51:01.767 --> 51:03.434
Holy shit.

51:06.188 --> 51:08.314
Get back here.

51:15.322 --> 51:17.531
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, ma'am.

51:20.327 --> 51:23.329
- Don't worry, I can explain everything.
- Shut up.

51:23.497 --> 51:26.999
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, ma'am.

51:27.167 --> 51:28.667
Yes, ma'am.

51:29.211 --> 51:32.922
You've been sneaking in here
every night for weeks.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.965
What? No.

51:35.133 --> 51:39.053
What do you think
I ought to do about this?

51:39.221 --> 51:41.889
Well, let's see.

51:47.354 --> 51:48.979
My God.

51:52.067 --> 51:53.859
Sir.

51:55.112 --> 51:56.695
Ma'am.

52:07.457 --> 52:11.710
A police officer must generate
respect and confidence.

52:11.878 --> 52:14.713
His or her voice, Hooks...

52:14.881 --> 52:18.592
has a great deal to do with that.
Hooks, get up. Stand right over here.

52:18.760 --> 52:20.845
Today, Hooks.

52:22.013 --> 52:26.016
Now, here is the house.

52:26.184 --> 52:28.310
Here is the window.

52:28.478 --> 52:31.397
And I am a burglar.

52:32.023 --> 52:34.900
I am coming out of the window...

52:35.068 --> 52:38.404
with a stolen stereo in my hand.

52:38.572 --> 52:41.907
I'm coming out of the window,
over the hedge...

52:42.075 --> 52:44.326
and you are the arresting officer.

52:44.494 --> 52:46.162
What do you say, Hooks?

52:46.746 --> 52:49.957
Don't move! This is a stickup.

52:51.751 --> 52:53.085
Stickup?

52:53.253 --> 52:56.714
I mean, police... Police officer. Stop.

52:57.507 --> 53:00.134
Sit down, Hooks.

53:00.594 --> 53:01.802
Sit, sit, sit.

53:04.306 --> 53:07.474
Tackleberry, you try it. Same situation.

53:07.851 --> 53:11.145
All right. Here is the house.
Here is the window.

53:11.313 --> 53:15.441
I'm the burglar. I'm coming out
of the house, over the hedge...

53:15.609 --> 53:17.818
I've got the stolen stereo in my hands.

53:17.986 --> 53:22.156
Drop that stereo before I blow
your goddamn nuts off, asshole!

53:26.286 --> 53:30.206
Tackleberry, we really need to talk.

53:31.124 --> 53:33.667
Mahoney, let me ask you a question.

53:35.212 --> 53:37.838
Have you ever had a woman just...

53:38.006 --> 53:41.550
throw you down
and screw your goddamn brains out?

53:41.718 --> 53:43.052
No.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.638
It happened to me last night.

53:45.805 --> 53:48.933
Really? How was it?

53:49.309 --> 53:51.769
I think...

53:53.355 --> 53:55.314
I'm in love.

53:58.568 --> 54:00.486
- How many girls were there?
- Just one.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.196
Just one?

54:03.323 --> 54:06.033
You made love to just one girl?

54:06.201 --> 54:07.701
That's disgusting.

54:07.869 --> 54:09.578
Yeah, I know.

54:10.997 --> 54:14.792
- Hey, George, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

54:16.294 --> 54:18.796
Every now and then...

54:18.964 --> 54:21.507
you seem to lose your Spanish accent.

54:21.675 --> 54:23.592
What's up?

54:23.760 --> 54:26.679
Yeah. Every now and then.

54:28.640 --> 54:30.307
Can you keep a secret?

54:30.475 --> 54:31.850
Oh, yeah.

54:32.018 --> 54:34.728
I'm not really George Martin.

54:34.896 --> 54:39.692
I'm just plain old George Martin,
fourth-generation American. Ha, ha.

54:40.068 --> 54:42.611
- Really?
- I just use the accent to get the girls.

54:44.531 --> 54:47.116
Does it work?

54:51.579 --> 54:54.707
- Barbara!
- He's in the gym.

54:54.874 --> 54:57.251
You're gonna pay for sending us
to the wrong party.

54:57.419 --> 55:00.212
- I'll tell him.
- Not just pushups, either, Leslie.

55:00.380 --> 55:04.049
We're gonna get your fat ass
thrown out of here. That's a promise!

55:04.217 --> 55:05.759
- How?
- How?

55:05.927 --> 55:07.052
You'll find out.

55:07.220 --> 55:09.805
Mahoney isn't the only one here
who can play tricks.

55:09.973 --> 55:12.182
Hey, hey. Take it easy.
These ain't track shoes.

55:12.350 --> 55:13.642
Yeah, I know. Just hurry up.

55:13.810 --> 55:17.479
I'm as anxious as you.
I'm not comfortable in these surroundings.

55:17.647 --> 55:19.606
- Yeah, well, come on up.
- Up here?

55:19.774 --> 55:22.443
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey, listen, when do I get my money?

55:22.610 --> 55:24.570
When the job's over,
for crying out loud.

55:33.955 --> 55:37.958
That's good, Hightower.
Why don't you just sit down over there?

55:41.463 --> 55:44.923
All right, you scumballs,
30 minutes to room inspection.

55:45.091 --> 55:47.926
Move it. Move it. Move it.

55:49.095 --> 55:53.057
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

55:57.228 --> 56:00.439
Got a light?

56:00.607 --> 56:05.277
I don't smoke. Ha, ha.
I have a friend who smokes. I'll go get him.

56:08.281 --> 56:10.407
Mahoney, major problem.

56:15.330 --> 56:18.624
Well, my goodness.

56:23.880 --> 56:28.217
Would you please just calm down
and take it easy?

56:30.345 --> 56:34.264
I just like to do it in strange places,
that's all. Okay?

56:34.432 --> 56:35.891
Why the hell didn't you say so?

56:37.143 --> 56:40.938
You'll find this academy one of the most
comprehensive in the country.

56:41.106 --> 56:45.651
I could point out many,
many, many features to you.

56:47.153 --> 56:49.279
- Squeeze in here. Yeah.
- In here?

56:49.447 --> 56:51.490
- You want to do it in a podium?
- All my life.

56:51.658 --> 56:53.534
- Right. Where you going?
- I'll be back.

56:53.701 --> 56:57.621
I'm not the customer. The real customer
will be here any second now, okay?

56:57.789 --> 56:59.623
Oh, okay.

56:59.791 --> 57:01.959
Gentlemen, please follow me.

57:02.127 --> 57:04.670
We have a very, very fine...

57:04.838 --> 57:07.172
slide presentation for you.

57:08.341 --> 57:10.342
Please take your seats.

57:10.677 --> 57:13.762
I think you'll find
there's plenty of room for everybody.

57:14.764 --> 57:16.181
Thank you.

57:20.854 --> 57:23.480
First of all, I'd like to say
how sorry I am...

57:23.648 --> 57:25.899
that everybody could not make it today.

57:26.067 --> 57:30.529
For those here, I think you'll find
the presentation interesting...

57:30.697 --> 57:33.365
as well as very, very stimulating.

57:42.542 --> 57:45.210
Could we have the lights turned down?

57:46.504 --> 57:49.214
Now, this first slide...

57:49.841 --> 57:51.967
shows a very...

57:52.594 --> 57:54.303
very interesting thing:

57:55.221 --> 57:57.181
Our main building.

57:58.725 --> 58:01.894
In slide two...

58:04.397 --> 58:06.190
we see...

58:07.233 --> 58:08.901
another view...

58:09.068 --> 58:11.445
of it.

58:12.280 --> 58:15.407
Oh, my God. You wouldn't believe it.

58:23.500 --> 58:27.794
Let us look at this slide for a moment,
without comment.

58:27.962 --> 58:30.214
I think it speaks for itself.

58:45.355 --> 58:47.022
Could we have the lights, please?

58:51.277 --> 58:52.694
Well.

58:53.238 --> 58:57.616
I hope this was as much fun for you
as it was for me.

58:59.786 --> 59:02.120
Let's have lunch, shall we?

59:02.789 --> 59:06.708
And maybe, smoke a cigarette.

59:29.315 --> 59:31.066
Good speech.

01:00:01.514 --> 01:00:03.599
What do you intend to do
about Mahoney?

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.684
- What's he done?
- What's he done?

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:09.980
I'll tell you what he's done. He...

01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:14.985
Yes, sir?

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:17.362
He did a very, very bad thing.

01:00:18.489 --> 01:00:20.157
To whom, sir?

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:22.242
To whom?

01:00:26.205 --> 01:00:27.706
Yes, sir.

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:31.501
Well, I don't know.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.254
Are you all right, sir?

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:37.466
No, not really. May I go?

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:40.927
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:42.846
You're welcome.

01:00:46.934 --> 01:00:50.228
Left, right, left. Left. Left.

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:01.948
Left, right, left. Left.

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:21.301
Left, right, left.
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:26.056
From now on, part of your training
will be to ride, from time to time...

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:29.643
in actual squad cars
with actual police officers...

01:01:29.811 --> 01:01:31.603
in actual situations.

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:34.648
And you'd better actually
keep your mouths shut.

01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:37.275
And your eyes and your ears open.

01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:41.113
Say, Mahoney,
why don't you ride with me?

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:48.203
Well, move it, cretins!
Move it, move it, move it!

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:52.290
Lieutenant Harris, I've changed
my mind. I want to be a cop.

01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:55.419
- Never, punk.
- Why not? All I have to do is behave...

01:01:55.586 --> 01:01:57.629
Get out of this car, Mahoney.
You hear me?

01:01:57.797 --> 01:02:02.259
You get. Get, Mahoney.
You get out there and you follow me.

01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:04.970
You stay right behind me, punk.

01:02:11.644 --> 01:02:14.062
Oh, how I love a ride in the country.

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:25.615
Officer. Officer.

01:02:25.783 --> 01:02:28.618
Can you get my kitty-cat out of the tree?

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:32.414
No problem, ma'am.

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.499
Oh, no. No, wait.

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:44.259
What the hell is this?

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:54.519
I'll be right back. I'm sorry.

01:03:03.529 --> 01:03:05.864
What the hell is going on down there?

01:03:06.365 --> 01:03:08.283
Move it!

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.370
Assholes.

01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:14.998
Hey! Hey, you, give me that bike.

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:19.461
Come on, move it. This is official
police business. Move it out. Let's go.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:22.047
- It's new.
- Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt it.

01:03:40.691 --> 01:03:42.567
My God.

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:45.070
Someone call a veterinarian.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:53.245
Your new hat, sir.

01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:09.261
You told no one?

01:04:09.428 --> 01:04:11.346
Not a soul.

01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:17.120
Hightower? Hightower?

01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:18.538
I need to talk.

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:20.749
That's terrific, Hightower, but it's...

01:05:21.208 --> 01:05:24.419
It's 2:30 in the morning.

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:27.672
- The driving course is tomorrow.
- So?

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.633
I haven't driven a car since I was 12.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.426
Really? You're kidding.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:36.348
If I don't pass this driving course,
they're gonna kick me out. Harris said so.

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:41.645
All right. Let's go.

01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:45.231
Sleeping is for fags.

01:05:45.524 --> 01:05:49.527
First thing we gotta do is steal a car.
Copeland's should do.

01:05:53.866 --> 01:05:55.784
Okay, your turn.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.495
Now, you've got to remember
to drive defensively...

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:03.208
or offensively, depending
on your needs. Let's go.

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:13.009
Comfy?

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:14.886
- No.
- All right.

01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:17.389
Let's just move the seat back a little.

01:06:17.556 --> 01:06:21.059
On second thought, let's rip
the front seats out and sit in the back.

01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:39.369
I was kidding about the front seat.
But this is good.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:41.871
It's different. Comfort's important.

01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:50.338
Put it into first. Right. Little more.
Okay, you can go a little faster now.

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:56.761
Yeah. Yeah, you're doing beautifully.
You feel it? You feel what's going on?

01:06:56.929 --> 01:06:59.556
You can even
turn off the windshield wipers.

01:07:00.474 --> 01:07:02.434
Yeah, that's it.

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.979
Okay, now there's another car.

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:09.858
Hightower?

01:07:11.235 --> 01:07:14.738
Hightow...? What...?
You didn't hit the brakes.

01:07:14.905 --> 01:07:17.032
You didn't tell me to.

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:18.783
You idiot!

01:07:18.951 --> 01:07:22.078
You bastard! You dumb shit!

01:07:33.507 --> 01:07:36.384
- Pull over and let me drive for a while.
- No, not now.

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.178
This is fun.

01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:43.725
- Pull over.
- No, I'm getting out of here.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.505
Holy shit!

01:08:37.654 --> 01:08:38.988
Attaboy, Hightower.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.379
Taught him everything he knows.

01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:08.935
Not bad.

01:09:09.353 --> 01:09:12.063
Miss Hooks, you're next.

01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:13.398
Hurry up!

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:16.067
Thanks, Mahoney. You saved my life.

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:18.819
- Maybe someday you'll save mine.
- Any time.

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.156
You're next. Yellow line. Yellow line.

01:09:21.698 --> 01:09:24.075
You better not cry

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:28.746
You better not pout
I'm telling you why

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:49.934
Wee!

01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:51.435
Oh, this is fun.

01:09:58.235 --> 01:10:00.111
What is it? What is it?

01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:02.238
She ran over my feet.

01:10:02.406 --> 01:10:04.782
I'm sorry. I really am.

01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:08.870
Sorry? You dumb, fat jigaboo!

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.208
Oh, shit.

01:10:20.966 --> 01:10:23.301
- At ease, Hightower. At ease.
- It's okay, Hightower.

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:26.846
- He didn't mean it. He was joking.
- Take it easy, now. Hightower!

01:10:27.014 --> 01:10:28.514
Hightower, don't do that.

01:10:28.682 --> 01:10:33.811
If you don't stop, you are out of here.
I am warning you, Hightower!

01:10:43.989 --> 01:10:46.824
You messed up big, mister.

01:10:46.992 --> 01:10:51.329
Now you get your stuff
and get out of here, right now.

01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:53.623
Get!

01:10:57.002 --> 01:10:59.545
Attention,
applications for motorcycle service...

01:10:59.713 --> 01:11:03.049
should be turned in
at the Administration building by Friday.

01:11:03.217 --> 01:11:05.927
Applications for motorcycle service
should be turned in...

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:09.097
One down, several to go.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.940
Copeland, get out of that car.

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:29.701
Mahoney.

01:11:32.162 --> 01:11:33.997
It's got to be Mahoney.

01:11:35.874 --> 01:11:39.627
I know, I know. Come on.

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:47.343
Out of all the people I thought would
make it, Hightower was the one.

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:51.222
I mean, if all the cops looked like him,
there'd be no crime at all.

01:11:52.349 --> 01:11:54.058
I'm getting sick of this place.

01:11:54.226 --> 01:11:57.061
How're you doing, "Ma-homo"?

01:11:57.479 --> 01:11:59.230
Don't fool with me.
Not in the mood.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:00.898
You wrecked my car.

01:12:01.066 --> 01:12:04.736
No, Hightower did. Why don't you
go see him? That'd be a matchup.

01:12:04.903 --> 01:12:07.030
Because we want you.

01:12:07.656 --> 01:12:11.075
Okay, how about 12:00 midnight?
Nine o'clock on the coast.

01:12:11.243 --> 01:12:15.621
No, no. I'm talking right now, Mahoney.
Let's go. You throw the first punch.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.332
Cadet could get thrown out...

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:20.001
- For hitting another cadet.
- Oh, really?

01:12:20.544 --> 01:12:23.212
I thought you wanted to get thrown out.

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.256
Here's your chance.

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:28.968
No.

01:12:30.387 --> 01:12:34.599
Now, Mahoney, I'm going to rub this
right in your face.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.351
On your mark...

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.394
get set...

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:53.201
- Wait, you guys! Wait!
- What the hell...?

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:56.162
Who threw the first punch?

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.748
- That's all I want to know.
- Barbara did.

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:01.584
- Barbara?
- That's right, sir.

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:05.671
Then he's out of here.
Him and his queer dog.

01:13:05.839 --> 01:13:09.133
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Barbara didn't throw the first punch.

01:13:09.301 --> 01:13:10.802
- He did so.
- I threw the punch.

01:13:10.969 --> 01:13:13.179
Mahoney, you're out
of your mind. Lieutenant...

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:17.433
- Blankes, who'd you rather have out?
- Is that true, Blankes?

01:13:19.144 --> 01:13:21.521
Did Mahoney start it?

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:26.984
Yes, sir. Mahoney started it.

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:32.031
Then, Mahoney, my little piss-ant...

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:35.868
you are out of the Academy...

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:37.995
forever.

01:13:39.873 --> 01:13:41.707
Get your stuff.

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:44.252
And get out.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.004
Too bad, so sad, bye-bye.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:03.855
Does the radio bother you?

01:14:07.025 --> 01:14:09.068
I could turn it down.

01:14:16.368 --> 01:14:18.453
Here, I brought you an apple.

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.414
Thanks.

01:14:27.212 --> 01:14:28.838
Hey, man, what...?

01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:52.403
My God. Here, take this.

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:55.156
Hey, free TV's.

01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:03.372
Hey, everybody! There's a riot going on.

01:15:08.962 --> 01:15:11.839
My livelihood! You're ruining me!

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:14.926
What do you got there?
What are you doing with that TV?

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:24.560
- Hi. Want a ride?
- No, thanks.

01:15:39.284 --> 01:15:40.826
Hey, did you two hear the news...

01:15:40.994 --> 01:15:42.495
- On the radio?
- No.

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:45.623
- A riot's broken out downtown.
- How come?

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:47.583
Who knows how these things
get started?

01:15:47.751 --> 01:15:50.002
Attention! All cadets report immediately...

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:51.796
to the parking lot in full riot gear.

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:55.967
Repeat, all cadets report immediately
to the parking lot in full riot gear.

01:15:56.134 --> 01:15:57.301
This is not a drill.

01:15:57.469 --> 01:16:00.304
- Jones! Was that you?
- No, man.

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:04.058
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:08.938
Get out there fast!
Move it, move it, move it!

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:11.107
Let's go, let's go.

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:28.541
This is it. This is the big one.

01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:31.043
It's time this cop...

01:16:31.211 --> 01:16:33.379
met the public.

01:16:39.177 --> 01:16:42.847
All right, listen up.
Here's the situation. There is a state...

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:46.225
of general disorder
in the Oakfield section of town.

01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:48.519
Real police are handling the problem.

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:51.856
We are being sent
to a peripheral safe area.

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:55.860
Our job will be merely to divert traffic
away from the trouble zone...

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:58.321
and to protect public property.

01:16:58.488 --> 01:17:00.114
You will have live ammunition...

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:02.199
but there will be no call to use it.

01:17:02.367 --> 01:17:06.203
Tackleberry, do you understand,
numb nuts?

01:17:06.371 --> 01:17:07.913
Yes, sir.

01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:17.548
Come on!

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.847
We are now entering
the expressway at Belmont.

01:17:25.432 --> 01:17:28.392
Very good. Your bus is to deploy
on Sixteenth Street...

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.519
between 4th and 8th Avenues.

01:17:30.687 --> 01:17:33.022
Sixteenth Street? Are you sure, sir?

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:35.650
Of course I'm sure.
I never forget a number.

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:38.277
Yes, sir.

01:17:38.445 --> 01:17:40.363
There's nobody around.

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:43.908
I guess they're hiding.

01:17:56.213 --> 01:17:59.382
All right, let's go, dirtbags, unload it.
Let's move it.

01:17:59.549 --> 01:18:02.301
I want two lines right here.
Come on, dummies.

01:18:02.469 --> 01:18:05.846
Let's go, let's go.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:11.769
You, one block over, one block up.

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:14.146
You, one block down.

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:18.651
You, one block up. You, one block over.

01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:23.114
You, one block over. Let's go. Let's go.

01:18:23.281 --> 01:18:25.491
If you have to make an arrest...

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:28.285
do it as quietly as possible.

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:33.290
Boy, it sure is quiet around here?

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:51.308
Hey, Fackler. How's it going?

01:18:51.476 --> 01:18:53.352
Oh, just fine, thanks.

01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:59.316
- What the hell are you doing here?
- We're from the Academy.

01:18:59.484 --> 01:19:03.404
You're supposed to be blocks away.
The damn riot's right down this street.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.448
We're pulling out.

01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:11.746
I love sushi. I'm into back-rubs,
all kinds of Japanese stuff.

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:14.165
My car stereo, it's a Sony.

01:19:14.332 --> 01:19:17.585
I got a good friend, his father was killed
at Pearl Harbor.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:21.505
Hey, maybe your family had
something to do with it?

01:19:21.673 --> 01:19:23.507
You know sake? The wine?

01:19:23.675 --> 01:19:27.553
I know a place where they heat it up
before they serve it.

01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:30.097
Holy shit.

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:32.516
I got to go now.

01:19:41.067 --> 01:19:42.818
Run!

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:15.351
Hello, men. I thought I'd come by
for a personal inspection.

01:20:16.394 --> 01:20:18.479
- Okay if we get in, sir?
- I guess so.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:21.732
Sure, why not?
Well, men, how's it going?

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.819
I want you to give me a fix
on the entire situation.

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:26.612
Not that good, sir.

01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:30.658
Oh, so this is very, very, very bad.

01:20:31.785 --> 01:20:33.911
The main thing is not to panic.

01:20:39.584 --> 01:20:41.961
Attention! Attention, everybody.

01:20:42.128 --> 01:20:47.258
Attention. This is Commandant
Eric Lassard of the Police Academy.

01:20:47.425 --> 01:20:50.636
If you do not disperse immediately,
my men will have to arrest you.

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:56.767
You have five seconds to move away.
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.272
Give me the thing.

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:39.602
You should park cars for a living, sir.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:48.402
Anybody want any of this?

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.237
You want this? You'd die for this.

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:52.406
- You're not so tough now.
- Come and take it.

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:54.909
- How about you? You want this?
- What's the matter?

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:59.288
- I'm talking to you, twerp.
- Just too dumb to talk?

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:29.985
Damn it. Look, in here.

01:22:32.489 --> 01:22:34.073
Try this one.

01:22:41.373 --> 01:22:45.918
Help. Help.
This is Cadet Leslie Barbara. Help.

01:22:46.086 --> 01:22:49.129
Barbara, this is Lt. Harris.

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:50.547
Just calm down.

01:22:51.549 --> 01:22:53.926
I'm being chased by 30 rioters.

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:57.554
Barbara, just tell me where you are.

01:22:57.722 --> 01:22:59.848
I'm passing you now, sir.

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:06.647
Holy shit.

01:23:12.904 --> 01:23:14.071
Hi.

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:21.036
Get the cops!

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:45.352
Okay. Hold it right there, guys.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.438
Why, if it isn't Leslie Barbara...

01:23:47.605 --> 01:23:50.107
- The police officer.
- Yeah.

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:53.152
Come on, Les,
you're not going to shoot us.

01:23:53.319 --> 01:23:56.405
You wouldn't shoot old friends,
would you?

01:24:01.953 --> 01:24:03.537
No.

01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:05.956
Les.

01:24:06.958 --> 01:24:09.209
Get lost. We're busy.

01:24:26.811 --> 01:24:31.607
Now, get the furniture back up there
and get out of the area.

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:34.359
But it's our furniture.

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:39.531
Sorry.

01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:54.463
Callahan calling Harris. Come in, please.

01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:56.215
Harris, come in.

01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:00.594
Where the hell is Harris?

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:02.846
- I don't know.
- What?

01:25:03.014 --> 01:25:05.099
- She doesn't know.
- I heard her.

01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:09.728
Run!

01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:21.073
Why don't you shoot back?

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:27.955
- Are those gunshots?
- Fucking A.

01:25:30.166 --> 01:25:32.751
Shoot back. Come on.

01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:37.339
Look up there. See? See?

01:25:37.507 --> 01:25:39.842
That looks like Harris up there.

01:25:40.009 --> 01:25:41.844
Should we shoot back?

01:25:48.726 --> 01:25:50.435
I don't think so.

01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:55.774
Come on!

01:25:58.528 --> 01:25:59.862
Stay there.

01:26:01.072 --> 01:26:02.531
Mahoney!

01:26:03.074 --> 01:26:05.450
Oh, shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:09.788
I'll bet there's a back door to this place.

01:26:09.956 --> 01:26:13.167
Hooks. Hooks!
Hooks, get the hell back here.

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:15.210
That's an order.

01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:10.474
Freeze!

01:27:11.851 --> 01:27:13.810
Oh, shit.

01:27:40.838 --> 01:27:42.506
Don't move, you bastard.

01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:45.801
Run, Thompson! Run!

01:27:47.887 --> 01:27:48.929
Put the gun down.

01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:52.432
Let's say you put your gun down.

01:27:55.853 --> 01:27:59.773
Lieutenant Harris, any last-minute
tips or suggestions?

01:28:02.151 --> 01:28:03.902
Nothing really comes to mind.

01:28:06.489 --> 01:28:08.073
What's it gonna be?

01:28:12.161 --> 01:28:14.204
Throw your gun over the ledge.

01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:18.292
I got two piglet-wigglets.

01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:22.379
Hey!

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.214
What do you want?

01:28:25.174 --> 01:28:27.467
I want to watch you off these pigs.

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:36.226
Sure. Ha, ha. Sure.

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.819
Which one do we do first?

01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:56.288
I believe I'd shoot this one.

01:28:56.456 --> 01:28:57.706
Yeah, the old one.

01:29:06.924 --> 01:29:11.553
- Looks like cadet revolvers to me.
- I know those guys.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.643
Don't move, dirtbag!

01:29:44.962 --> 01:29:47.172
Hey. Aw. Hey, hey.

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:49.424
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What's wrong with this man?

01:29:49.592 --> 01:29:52.260
There was gunplay, sir, and he missed it.

01:30:03.439 --> 01:30:07.025
- Lieutenant Harris? Captain Reed.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

01:30:07.193 --> 01:30:10.320
Thank you. I also want to thank you
for looking out for Mahoney.

01:30:10.488 --> 01:30:12.906
It was an honor and a pleasure, sir.

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:15.117
Thank you, sir. Ha, ha.

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:24.000
- Could you just...?
- This woman bothering you?

01:30:24.168 --> 01:30:27.212
What? No. This is my mother.

01:30:28.464 --> 01:30:30.799
Ten-four. Carry on.

01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:32.759
- Oh, my precious...
- Mom, would...?

01:30:33.136 --> 01:30:35.303
- Then at 8:00 you'll meet my mother.
- Right.

01:30:35.471 --> 01:30:38.014
- You'd better have some flowers.
- Flowers, check.

01:30:41.978 --> 01:30:43.437
You men, stop that.

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:49.734
Oh, well, ha, ha.

01:30:49.902 --> 01:30:51.570
That's more like it, Mahoney.

01:30:52.363 --> 01:30:54.739
Good man. Keep up the good work.

01:30:55.408 --> 01:30:56.867
Thank you, sir.

01:30:57.034 --> 01:31:01.246
Ladies and gentlemen, the commandant
of the Academy, Eric Lassard.

01:31:08.004 --> 01:31:11.423
So many unusual events have happened
to this graduating class...

01:31:11.591 --> 01:31:13.300
and to me, also.

01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:16.928
I could tell you many, many stories,
but instead...

01:31:17.096 --> 01:31:19.306
I have a presentation to make.

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:23.018
No Academy cadet has ever received
the highest award...

01:31:23.186 --> 01:31:25.145
this police department has to make.

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:27.772
Today, there are two:

01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:31.318
Officers Moses Hightower...

01:31:32.195 --> 01:31:34.154
and Carey Mahoney.

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.573
Gentlemen, please step forward.

01:32:12.151 --> 01:32:14.569
You are both expected
to make a few short remarks.

01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:20.283
Officer Hightower.

01:32:25.957 --> 01:32:27.457
Thanks.

01:32:29.919 --> 01:32:32.796
That was very, very, very good.

01:32:33.297 --> 01:32:35.298
Officer Mahoney.

01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:43.974
Thank you, Commandant Lassard,
Chief Hurnst...

01:32:44.141 --> 01:32:46.601
Madam Mayor, Mr. President...

01:32:46.769 --> 01:32:50.313
His Holiness the Pope,
the King of Norway...

01:32:50.481 --> 01:32:52.482
and our other honored guests.
