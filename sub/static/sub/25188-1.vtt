01:05.315 --> 01:06.315
Oops.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.125
Hello?

01:25.335 --> 01:26.335
Hello?

01:57.242 --> 01:58.242
Hi.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.115
Mm.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.122
How late can we go?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.374
I don't know.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.867
Do we have to go?

02:07.878 --> 02:08.709
No.

02:08.711 --> 02:09.543
Oh!

02:10.672 --> 02:11.672
You're lying.

02:12.716 --> 02:13.716
I am.

02:15.552 --> 02:16.552
I am.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.607
Monster bubbles!

02:34.529 --> 02:36.020
I think he wants you.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.459
♪ Now I am singing so beautifully ♪

02:54.883 --> 02:56.465
Oh, Mommy's funny.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.799
It's like she has a mustache
right under her nose.

03:03.809 --> 03:04.640
She does?

03:04.643 --> 03:06.305
Yeah.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.973
I think she has really big lips.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.573
Hey!

03:21.576 --> 03:23.442
Tom, just want to say congratulations.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.284
Thank you.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.368
Yeah, only 10 years of purgatory, right?

03:25.372 --> 03:26.453
Oh, right.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.287
My brother-in-law, Greg.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.121
Hey.

03:28.125 --> 03:28.956
Hi, nice to see you.

03:28.959 --> 03:29.790
I think Jake's like twice the size

03:29.793 --> 03:30.624
he was at Christmas.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.458
Oh, yeah.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.202
You know, we should
really stop feeding him.

03:35.757 --> 03:36.918
Come on, enjoy yourself.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.712
Corinne, my daughter, Alex.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.550
Hi, nice to meet you.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.543
Um, sorry...

03:40.554 --> 03:42.090
She worked with Paul Schuster from the

03:42.097 --> 03:45.135
Public Defender's office,
you remember Paul.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.553
And it turns out before that,

03:46.560 --> 03:49.098
she and your brother
overlapped at Fordham,

03:49.104 --> 03:49.969
but they never met.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.346
Oh, how funny.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.972
You must be so proud.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.942
I heard he's the youngest
partner in the firm's history?

03:55.944 --> 03:57.401
Well, he's always been driven.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.815
What can I say?

03:58.822 --> 04:00.279
And you're an attorney as well?

04:00.282 --> 04:01.693
Uh, no.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.531
I mean, I was.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.901
But I stopped practicing
when I had my son.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.777
Thank God for the women's movement.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.030
She'll go back, trust me.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.372
Oh, is this you?

04:10.375 --> 04:11.206
Oh, Jesus.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.702
What?

04:13.712 --> 04:14.623
It's adorable!

04:14.629 --> 04:16.291
Oh, she was so good.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.711
Now, if she had stuck
to it, can you imagine?

04:18.716 --> 04:20.834
She's got the natural
pose, the natural arch.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.302
Look at that, slim legs,
everything she needed.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.386
Gave up.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.345
What can you do?

04:25.348 --> 04:26.680
Can't push, push, push.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.140
Gotta let go, right?

04:28.143 --> 04:29.143
Right?

04:30.061 --> 04:31.051
She's humble.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.304
Ha, where'd she get that?

04:33.315 --> 04:34.315
Thank you.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.191
And where are you guys applying?

04:37.194 --> 04:38.184
Oh, boy.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.356
What?

04:39.362 --> 04:41.649
Well, we loved our local public school,

04:41.656 --> 04:43.864
but it just got rezoned.

04:43.867 --> 04:44.698
No!

04:44.701 --> 04:46.613
It'll be fine.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.531
The whole reason we moved and

04:47.537 --> 04:49.028
now they won't let us send him.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.496
I swear, if Pembrooke hadn't discovered

04:50.499 --> 04:52.832
that Kimmy had perfect pitch
halfway through her interview,

04:52.834 --> 04:56.043
which, mind you, we
didn't even know

04:56.046 --> 04:57.287
I mean, just forget it.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.504
Dizzy!

05:06.515 --> 05:07.346
Dizzy!

05:07.349 --> 05:08.260
Oh!

05:08.266 --> 05:09.598
Honk, honk!

05:09.601 --> 05:10.887
Wait, come back!

05:10.894 --> 05:11.930
But I must go.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.428
Please don't go!

05:14.773 --> 05:16.856
That's when you say, "I
don't even know your name."

05:16.858 --> 05:18.394
But I do know your name.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.518
That's not how it goes.

05:20.529 --> 05:24.694
Well, maybe Mommy was improvising!

05:24.699 --> 05:26.440
Maybe she was improvising!

05:34.793 --> 05:36.625
My sister-in-law comes from serious money.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.745
I swear, all she does is shop for the kid.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.621
Meanwhile, I'm lucky if I can get Jake

05:40.632 --> 05:42.749
out of his pajama bottoms half the time.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.250
He likes to be comfortable.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.127
Hell, I'd do the same thing if I could

05:46.137 --> 05:47.298
get away with it.

05:47.305 --> 05:48.762
You think the other parents would mind?

05:48.765 --> 05:51.178
Their preschool director in a tracksuit?

05:51.184 --> 05:52.595
You would look hot in a tracksuit.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.470
You are such a liar.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.518
But, you know, is that
even what I want for Jake?

05:58.525 --> 06:00.812
A private school full of Kimmys?

06:00.819 --> 06:03.106
Even if we could afford
it, which we can't.

06:03.113 --> 06:03.978
Honey, honey.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.197
We're just talking options right now,

06:06.199 --> 06:07.406
casting a wide net.

06:07.409 --> 06:08.365
Here you go, ladies.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.199
Thank you.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.443
Uh-uh, uh-uh, I got this.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.409
No, no.

06:11.413 --> 06:12.244
Okay?

06:12.247 --> 06:14.705
You just get me the essay
by Thursday, no excuses.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.546
Sandra?

06:21.381 --> 06:22.212
Mm-hmm.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.376
Come on back.

06:34.978 --> 06:38.392
I should probably warn
you, I'm not sure I buy it.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.732
This, I mean, was um, Ben's idea.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.147
Ben's my husband.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.949
For now.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.118
How long ago did he move out?

06:54.205 --> 06:55.446
Six days ago.

06:55.457 --> 06:56.993
Yeah, he found a temporary place.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.876
He says he'll do marriage counseling,

07:00.879 --> 07:05.465
but only if I work on me first.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.427
Suddenly, he's Dr. Phil.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.062
Can I ask, how does this work?

07:24.069 --> 07:26.607
I just sit here and talk and...

07:26.613 --> 07:29.822
It seems like it's important
for you to have a plan.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.713
That what I have to look forward to?

07:52.639 --> 07:54.972
A rich man's wife became sick

07:55.850 --> 07:59.059
and when she felt that
her end was drawing near,

07:59.062 --> 08:01.679
she called her only
daughter to her bedside

08:01.690 --> 08:05.604
and said, "Dear child, remain good."

08:05.610 --> 08:08.318
The girl went out to her
mother's grave every day

08:08.321 --> 08:09.687
and wept.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.315
When winter came, the
snow spread white cloth

08:12.325 --> 08:13.987
over the grave

08:13.994 --> 08:17.328
and when the spring sun
had removed it again,

08:17.330 --> 08:20.494
the man took himself another wife.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.414
Times soon grew very bad
for the poor stepchild.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.664
"Why should that stupid goose

08:27.674 --> 08:30.291
"sit in the parlor with us," they said.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.884
"Out with this kitchen maid!"

08:48.194 --> 08:49.105
Home again, home again.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.148
There you are.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.317
I stopped by Gristedes.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.814
God, what a zoo.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.157
Oh, thanks.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.150
You didn't have to go tonight.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.447
Oh, hello, hello, hello.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.454
Hey.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.447
What is all this?

09:02.500 --> 09:05.334
It's a draft for the parent essay

09:05.336 --> 09:07.043
for the private schools.

09:07.047 --> 09:07.878
Alex...

09:07.881 --> 09:08.712
I know, I know,

09:08.715 --> 09:11.583
but I had lunch with Judy today

09:11.593 --> 09:15.758
and she thinks we might have
a shot at a scholarship.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.515
Really?

09:19.893 --> 09:20.724
Here, here, you relax.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.639
No, no, no, I've got this.

09:24.355 --> 09:26.312
I mean, you don't...

09:26.316 --> 09:28.683
You don't think that's a waste of time?

09:28.693 --> 09:30.184
I mean, you know,

09:30.195 --> 09:32.983
it's a long shot, obviously, but...

09:32.989 --> 09:34.230
Right.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.108
I went by the public school
that we are zoned for now

09:37.118 --> 09:39.952
and it's not great, honestly.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.365
The classrooms are overcrowded,

09:41.372 --> 09:44.365
I'm just worried he
could get totally lost.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.459
I know we've always said
we're not those parents,

09:47.462 --> 09:48.327
but I don't know.
- We can't afford to be.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.338
Maybe...

09:50.924 --> 09:52.540
Greg!

09:52.550 --> 09:53.540
Relax.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.551
Anyway.

09:55.887 --> 09:58.345
She said we should at
least try a few privates

09:58.348 --> 09:59.338
along with the magnet program,

09:59.349 --> 10:02.387
so I was hoping you
could help me brainstorm.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.224
Tonight?

10:03.228 --> 10:04.594
You are so much better
at this than I am.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.435
I am not better at this than you.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.645
No, you are wonderful, Alex!
- No, no, no, you are!

10:06.648 --> 10:09.061
Everything I write seems so cloying.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.313
Is there a prompt?

10:12.320 --> 10:13.731
Oh, you know...

10:14.864 --> 10:17.106
How is Jake more special
than all the other

10:17.117 --> 10:17.948
hundreds of thousands of...

10:17.951 --> 10:20.113
Okay, okay, is there an actual prompt?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.533
Um, let's see.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.164
All right.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.204
Imagine someone were to see a room full of

10:28.211 --> 10:30.168
children playing.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.003
Ignoring physical attributes,

10:32.006 --> 10:34.168
how would they identify your child?

10:35.552 --> 10:37.760
Show 'em about this.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.173
No!

10:39.180 --> 10:40.011
That is not funny!

10:40.014 --> 10:41.346
That's exactly the kind of thing

10:41.349 --> 10:43.181
that sounds like parent bullshit.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.425
But that is not bullshit.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.301
He was hours old.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.178
Developmentally, babies
don't typically do that

10:48.189 --> 10:49.600
for days at least.

10:49.607 --> 10:50.438
Yeah.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.103
- He was clearly, oh shit...
- Oh, be careful, be careful!

10:52.110 --> 10:53.396
What is she doing on the toaster oven?

10:53.403 --> 10:54.234
She's drying.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.773
Her head broke off.

10:55.780 --> 10:59.444
I guess she fell and he came out sobbing

10:59.450 --> 11:01.783
with this decapitated Cinderella,

11:01.786 --> 11:03.778
like she'd been guillotined.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.404
So what, you super-glued her?

11:05.415 --> 11:06.246
Well, yeah.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.241
I kept insisting, you know, she's fine.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.459
I told him it was another necklace.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.997
Aww.

11:12.005 --> 11:12.836
He buy that?

11:12.839 --> 11:13.670
I think.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.673
Mm-hmm.

11:17.635 --> 11:21.595
I've always said the
more attention we pay now,

11:21.598 --> 11:23.840
the more we really listen,

11:23.850 --> 11:26.843
the more engaged and confident they'll be.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.266
Not just in school, but their whole lives.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.810
Which is why it is so important to create

11:31.816 --> 11:34.433
a preschool atmosphere where children

11:34.444 --> 11:36.481
are encouraged to be their truest,

11:36.487 --> 11:38.604
most authentic selves.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.403
At this age, that's really
the most important thing.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.823
Yeah, but they're just
playing all day, right?

11:44.829 --> 11:47.162
I mean, basically what you got here is

11:47.165 --> 11:49.282
a well-funded playroom.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.328
Well,

11:51.628 --> 11:54.541
the truth is creativity and imagination

11:54.547 --> 11:58.166
are both foundational for
all types of higher learning.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.668
A colleague of mine wrote a
great book on the subject,

12:00.678 --> 12:02.169
if you're interested.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.967
It's very accessible.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.181
If it's crap you can tell me.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.178
No, no, shh.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.101
It's just so hard to pitch him...

12:13.107 --> 12:14.848
Oh, trust me, I get it.

12:14.859 --> 12:15.859
I get it.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.606
I am almost...

12:22.617 --> 12:23.617
Done.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.030
Okay.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.369
My God, your face.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.283
What?

12:28.289 --> 12:30.121
Maybe this is not even worth it.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.035
Stop.

12:31.042 --> 12:31.873
It's terrific.

12:31.876 --> 12:32.707
Really?

12:32.710 --> 12:34.167
Yes.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.126
There's only one thing I...

12:35.129 --> 12:37.462
No, of course, I mean,
you must have notes.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.422
You talk about his imagination,

12:39.425 --> 12:40.836
which is great,

12:40.843 --> 12:42.709
since that's really the best indicator.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.757
Why not use that as a lead-in

12:44.764 --> 12:47.427
to talk a little about
his gender expansive play?

12:50.186 --> 12:52.018
With anecdotes.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.478
So, you mean like...

12:54.857 --> 12:56.644
It could be anything, really.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.893
I was in his classroom on Tuesday

12:58.903 --> 13:02.021
and he and Emily and Michelle

13:02.031 --> 13:04.865
were creating their own fairy tale,

13:04.867 --> 13:06.733
this enchanted forest,

13:06.744 --> 13:11.034
and they'd made trees
out of chairs and pillows

13:11.040 --> 13:12.872
and Jake...

13:12.875 --> 13:16.494
Jake was this princess who
didn't know she was a princess

13:16.504 --> 13:19.997
and Emily was the witch who
was keeping her locked up

13:20.008 --> 13:24.127
and Michelle was somebody's
helper or something, but...

13:25.680 --> 13:29.515
Anyway, it was really Jake
who was the ringleader.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.435
You think talking about that would...

13:33.438 --> 13:34.599
I mean, I'm sure you're right,

13:34.605 --> 13:36.597
I just wanna make sure that I understand.

13:36.607 --> 13:39.691
Well, for one thing,
someone's gonna read this

13:39.694 --> 13:41.276
and then they're gonna meet Jake

13:41.279 --> 13:43.441
and it always a good sign

13:43.448 --> 13:45.781
when parents seem to
really know their kids,

13:45.783 --> 13:47.615
which, of course, you do.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.449
Right.

13:48.453 --> 13:51.161
But there's sort of a
big part of his personality

13:51.164 --> 13:53.702
that you don't even mention, right?

13:55.126 --> 13:56.583
Here's the second thing.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.248
The numbers are ridiculous.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.621
Especially when it comes to which families

14:00.631 --> 14:02.088
they're gonna help financially.

14:03.301 --> 14:04.837
But what you have to remember is

14:04.844 --> 14:06.130
everybody wants diversity.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.180
Mm-hmm.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.223
Let's be honest, Jake,

14:12.852 --> 14:15.390
he's very special.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.853
And believe me, this is the part of my job

14:16.856 --> 14:20.349
I hate the most, this, this strategizing.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.979
But I really think that this
is a card you could play.

14:25.448 --> 14:26.448
That's all.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.358
Not to mention, you
want him to be somewhere

14:29.369 --> 14:30.576
he can thrive, right?

14:37.627 --> 14:39.914
And the prince fell on Rapunzel.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.416
Standing on Rapunzel.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.790
Look what I made.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.793
All right, so it's all
about progression, right?

14:46.803 --> 14:48.465
It's like you have to
have the right story,

14:48.471 --> 14:50.838
so this is my pulled together,

14:50.848 --> 14:52.305
you don't have to worry about me

14:52.308 --> 14:56.473
because I'm a modern, independent,
working woman picture.

14:56.479 --> 14:57.310
Right?

14:57.313 --> 14:58.144
Very slick, yeah.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.137
Thank you.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.686
And then this one,
which is loving mommy.

15:01.692 --> 15:02.523
Aww!

15:02.527 --> 15:04.314
Loving mommy, yes, I have a kid,

15:04.320 --> 15:06.482
and if that freaks you out, well, too bad,

15:06.489 --> 15:08.731
'cause I'm not going to
apologize about it kinda picture.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.777
Sort of pimping him
out, though, aren't you?

15:09.784 --> 15:10.615
Stop!

15:10.618 --> 15:11.449
No, I'm not.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.193
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
show him the message.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.161
Sanjay, come on, baby, it's that time.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.405
We're not done yet.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.247
Right, okay.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.162
"Wowza, Amal!

15:19.168 --> 15:21.831
"You are truly an exotic beauty

15:21.838 --> 15:24.330
"and your English is so impressive!

15:24.340 --> 15:26.753
"Maybe we could go for a ride sometime.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.375
"No magic carpet here,
but I do have a Prius!"

15:28.386 --> 15:29.672
No, no!

15:29.679 --> 15:30.886
What is wrong with people?

15:30.888 --> 15:31.719
Right?

15:31.722 --> 15:33.088
I know, and it's not even the half of it.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.806
Come on, baby, I'm not jo-

15:34.809 --> 15:35.890
Where did they?

15:35.893 --> 15:36.883
Oh, what in the world?

15:36.894 --> 15:37.725
I'm so sorry, Alex.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.559
No, no, no, I got it.

15:38.563 --> 15:39.394
This is all Jake.

15:39.397 --> 15:40.228
Are you sure?

15:40.231 --> 15:41.062
Yes.

15:41.065 --> 15:41.896
- Let me take that.
- Thank you.

15:41.899 --> 15:42.730
Okay, bye.

15:42.733 --> 15:43.564
Sanjay, come on!

15:43.568 --> 15:44.854
Mommy's had a long day.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.272
He can't leave!

15:46.279 --> 15:48.316
Well, he has to.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.872
You really don't think it's weird?

16:02.879 --> 16:04.290
About Judy.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.835
Mm.

16:06.841 --> 16:07.922
I don't know, I mean...

16:09.218 --> 16:11.676
She was strategizing, right?

16:11.679 --> 16:13.261
Yeah, no, the strategizing I get,

16:13.264 --> 16:16.007
but the way she was talking,
it was just a little...

16:17.643 --> 16:18.724
I don't know.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.935
I mean, he does like to play dress-up,

16:24.942 --> 16:26.558
that's not news.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.027
Not that I care, obviously, but,

16:29.030 --> 16:32.114
he's not exactly Johnny Basketball.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.607
Johnny what?

16:33.618 --> 16:35.154
You know.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.618
That's not an expression.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.829
I know it's not, I'm just saying.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.949
What's your day like tomorrow?

16:41.959 --> 16:44.201
I have a break around noon.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.454
I go into Legal Aide till three,

16:46.464 --> 16:47.464
then pick up Jake.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.463
You okay?

16:52.470 --> 16:53.301
Yeah.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.304
Yeah, of course.

17:17.494 --> 17:18.359
Laurel!

17:18.371 --> 17:19.202
Laurel.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.036
Hi, Greg.

17:20.039 --> 17:20.869
Hey.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.454
Listen, um, I've been meaning to mention,

17:22.458 --> 17:23.539
and maybe you've already noticed this,

17:23.542 --> 17:25.829
but the walls here are a little...

17:29.715 --> 17:32.753
And most of my patients,
they're pretty tame,

17:32.760 --> 17:34.001
but you know, if you ever,

17:34.011 --> 17:35.798
if there's a noise issue or...

17:35.805 --> 17:37.922
Oh, you're so sweet.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.798
I haven't even noticed.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.801
Oh, and I wouldn't want
you to worry about that.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.804
I know in my own work how important

17:44.814 --> 17:47.181
vocalizing can be.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.649
I find it so helpful in
releasing all kinds of

17:49.652 --> 17:50.768
emotional buildup.

17:50.778 --> 17:51.609
Right.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.372
I'm sure you're familiar
with Arthur Janov.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.824
It's scream therapy.

17:57.827 --> 17:58.908
It's what?

17:58.911 --> 18:01.369
Janov, he was big in the sixties.

18:01.372 --> 18:04.080
He's all about finding your primal scream

18:04.083 --> 18:06.541
and releasing it into the world.

18:06.544 --> 18:07.751
Jesus.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.415
Yeah, and apparently,
this is like her niche,

18:09.422 --> 18:10.253
you know?

18:10.256 --> 18:11.776
Which means this is not going to stop.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.257
Hello?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.260
Yeah, sorry, I...

18:16.721 --> 18:18.053
It's not his personality.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.762
I think that's what bugged me.

18:19.765 --> 18:20.926
What?

18:20.933 --> 18:21.969
About Judy.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.717
She was acting like I'd failed to mention

18:23.728 --> 18:26.266
some deep-seated part
of him and it's like,

18:26.272 --> 18:27.763
yeah, he likes fairy tales,

18:27.773 --> 18:28.729
but maybe that's not the most

18:28.733 --> 18:30.941
critical thing worth mentioning.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.560
He knows all 50 states, he's
already started reading.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.233
How many kids his age are reading?

18:35.239 --> 18:37.526
Hey, Allie, Allie,
okay, look, I love you,

18:37.533 --> 18:39.240
but I think that you're fixating.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.609
No, I'm not fixating, I just think

18:40.620 --> 18:41.827
he should get a clean slate.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.572
I don't want to send him
off to kindergarten labeled.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.323
I don't think anyone's
trying to label him.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.246
You know, Allie, Judy loves Jake.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.584
Judy loves you.

18:49.587 --> 18:50.953
She's on your side, all right?

18:50.963 --> 18:52.795
And she's not, you know, your mother.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.586
Hey.

18:55.593 --> 18:56.593
Hey, I was kidding.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.178
No, it's fine, um...

19:00.181 --> 19:01.181
Allie.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.135
Look, I gotta go.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.475
Uh, I love you.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.500
Nipples.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.371
I wanna touch your nipple.

19:41.222 --> 19:46.183
What if we pitched it
like Jake is not limited

19:46.644 --> 19:49.478
to trucks or whatever.

19:50.564 --> 19:54.308
Uh, he likes all sorts of toys and games,

19:54.318 --> 19:55.559
equal opportunity.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.897
Yeah, our son, who walks into a Toys R Us

19:59.907 --> 20:03.742
and he does not discriminate on the basis

20:03.744 --> 20:06.987
of perceived gender norms.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.993
That's actually not that bad.

20:10.835 --> 20:13.623
But that's just an idea, we don't have...

20:18.342 --> 20:19.342
Oh, my God.

20:20.886 --> 20:21.886
Allie.

20:23.889 --> 20:24.889
What's wrong?

20:25.850 --> 20:28.809
Whoa, whoa, you're not happy?

20:28.811 --> 20:30.473
No, no, of course I'm happy, I...

20:30.479 --> 20:31.811
Hey, hey.

20:36.527 --> 20:37.358
I just don't.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.398
I don't want to assume.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.816
No, of course not.

20:40.823 --> 20:41.823
And we won't.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.201
But with Jake everything was fine.

20:47.705 --> 20:48.821
It's not a pattern.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.505
I just, I...

21:01.343 --> 21:04.461
I guess I didn't think
it would happen so fast.

21:07.725 --> 21:12.470
Well, I am sorry that
I'm so damn virile.

21:13.731 --> 21:16.269
I don't know what else to
say besides that, though,

21:16.275 --> 21:17.275
I am sorry.

21:28.245 --> 21:31.534
Bye, Miss Matthews, thank you.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.724
This is a very dressed up mess.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.771
We believe
it's our job to harness

21:59.777 --> 22:02.485
every student's unique potential.

22:05.783 --> 22:07.649
Nurturing intellectual curiosity...

22:07.660 --> 22:08.867
Critical thinking...

22:08.869 --> 22:10.326
Problem solving...

22:10.329 --> 22:11.536
Artistic expression.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.498
Jake, breakfast!

22:22.508 --> 22:24.841
Socks make my feet sticky!

22:24.844 --> 22:26.210
Hey, buddy.

22:26.220 --> 22:27.836
We're running late.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.510
We do give priority to siblings.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.633
My wife is on a ton of boards.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.430
I don't know if that's helpful, or...

22:35.604 --> 22:37.015
You know, it's impossible to predict,

22:37.022 --> 22:39.730
but on average it's approximately 400.

22:39.733 --> 22:40.974
600.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.476
900.

22:42.486 --> 22:45.524
36,000 children applied for a spot

22:45.531 --> 22:48.274
in one of the cities
magnet programs last year.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.117
In a few weeks we'll
visit some new schools

22:51.120 --> 22:53.828
and you'll play with some
kids and meet some teachers

22:53.831 --> 22:55.538
and you should just be yourself.

22:55.541 --> 22:56.907
And that's all that matters, okay?

22:56.917 --> 22:59.455
So it's no big deal at all.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.292
Yes.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.127
No biggie.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.042
Um, you could
have a fruit roll-up

23:03.048 --> 23:03.879
later if you want.

23:03.883 --> 23:04.714
Yeah!

23:04.717 --> 23:07.710
Except they're kind of sticky.

23:12.975 --> 23:13.975
Hello?

23:14.643 --> 23:16.475
Wheeler, yeah.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.936
W-H-E-E-L-E-R.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.355
And my son is Jake.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.648
Preschools will receive
feedback in December.

23:28.365 --> 23:32.359
Of course we wish we had room
for all your little angels,

23:33.454 --> 23:34.615
but the numbers are what they are.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.330
The
numbers are what they are.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.511
Oh, look at that!

23:59.521 --> 24:00.352
What's that?

24:00.356 --> 24:01.312
Is that for us?

24:01.315 --> 24:02.146
Yes!

24:02.149 --> 24:03.060
No, I did that.

24:03.067 --> 24:04.649
Let me try.

24:06.070 --> 24:07.106
That's what I clicked on.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.273
No, I think it's the one over there.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.111
I don't know.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.025
I can't deal with this.

24:10.032 --> 24:11.032
There.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.242
Right?

24:29.677 --> 24:31.839
I mean, it's insane.

24:33.222 --> 24:37.592
Between the down regs and the stems,

24:37.601 --> 24:39.934
trigger shots, blood samples.

24:39.937 --> 24:43.055
I mean, not to mention
anesthetic for egg retrieval.

24:43.065 --> 24:46.809
All in all, you're probably
stabbed about 75 times

24:46.819 --> 24:48.560
per cycle.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.983
And most of the stabbing
you're doing to yourself.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.983
I had this whole kit at the office.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.905
They say if you're
squeamish about needles,

24:55.911 --> 24:59.621
IVF will either cure you or break you.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.457
I actually...

25:04.878 --> 25:06.540
That doesn't bother you?

25:06.547 --> 25:07.378
You mean...

25:07.381 --> 25:09.373
The banshee next door.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.217
What about Ben?

25:20.227 --> 25:21.763
What about him?

25:21.770 --> 25:23.557
Was he supportive?

25:23.564 --> 25:25.851
Just, in all this.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.268
We've got a few minutes.

25:31.113 --> 25:32.649
He'd call the office.

25:33.574 --> 25:36.442
Constantly checking in, you know,

25:36.452 --> 25:38.364
he'd email me these fertility blogs,

25:38.370 --> 25:39.827
what to eat, what not to eat.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.617
That sounds like a lot of pressure.

25:42.750 --> 25:43.750
You have kids?

25:44.960 --> 25:45.960
Yeah, one.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.755
It's like when guys
say, "We're pregnant!"

25:50.758 --> 25:52.249
You know?

25:52.259 --> 25:53.716
Like, wow.

25:53.719 --> 25:56.006
Equality, great.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.471
But actually you're not,
so maybe you could just

25:59.767 --> 26:00.928
fuck off a little bit.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.888
Allie, come on.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.107
You're being ridiculous.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.065
I'm fine.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.401
You've got clients.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.393
So what, so I'll reschedule.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.940
Cue the ballerina.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.984
It's his first interview,
this is important.

26:15.991 --> 26:16.822
He's gonna be nervous.

26:16.825 --> 26:17.656
Exactly.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.570
You know, I'm sorry, but what happens

26:18.577 --> 26:20.068
if you puke on the train?

26:20.079 --> 26:22.071
You think that's gonna
put him in a good mood?

26:23.207 --> 26:25.415
All right, there's some apple slices

26:25.417 --> 26:26.282
with peanut butter in the kitchen.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.704
Make sure he eats on the way.

26:30.798 --> 26:34.462
Yeah, but Little
Mermaid's my favorite movie.

26:34.468 --> 26:35.754
Mm-hmm.

26:43.685 --> 26:44.516
Here you go.

26:44.520 --> 26:45.306
Thank you very much.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.770
Hey Jake, let's go over there.

26:53.237 --> 26:54.318
First time?

26:55.948 --> 26:56.948
Yeah.

26:57.825 --> 27:00.192
At our last one they left the door open,

27:00.202 --> 27:01.909
so I could peek in.

27:01.912 --> 27:03.949
And I saw my son was drawing a picture

27:03.956 --> 27:06.414
and I thought, "that's
good, that's good," right?

27:06.416 --> 27:07.827
So the teacher comes over and says,

27:07.835 --> 27:09.667
"Hey, what's that?"

27:09.670 --> 27:11.536
And he said, "A gun."

27:15.759 --> 27:18.342
Well, he can' fix America, no?

27:18.345 --> 27:19.506
No, he can't.

27:21.598 --> 27:22.598
Mr. Wheeler.

27:23.851 --> 27:26.059
Can I have a word with you?

27:29.148 --> 27:30.559
Alexandra, it's your mother.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.058
I haven't heard from you in over a week.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.559
Call me old-fashioned, but I don't think

27:34.570 --> 27:37.278
a simple phone call is so much to ask.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.489
An emoji does not count.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.653
In any case, listen, I
just talked to your brother

27:41.660 --> 27:44.243
and Kimmy's got a piano
recital on the eleventh.

27:44.246 --> 27:46.283
I don't know if you've
heard her play recently,

27:46.290 --> 27:49.203
but she's really getting very good.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.997
It's amazing, frankly,
the discipline at her age.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.870
I thought it might be
nice for Jake to see.

27:53.881 --> 27:55.964
It might inspire him, who knows.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.879
Oh, have you set a date
for his birthday party yet?

27:58.886 --> 28:01.094
I don't want a situation like last year.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.212
Really broke my heart.

28:02.222 --> 28:03.053
So call me.

28:03.056 --> 28:05.048
I'm at the office, be here all day.

28:05.058 --> 28:06.265
Remember what that's like?

28:24.912 --> 28:26.619
Of course it's ridiculous,
I'm not saying it's not...

28:26.622 --> 28:27.988
I mean, abusive was the word you used.

28:27.998 --> 28:28.829
Okay.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.368
You said whoever had the bright idea

28:30.375 --> 28:32.742
to evaluate toddlers using test scores

28:32.753 --> 28:33.584
deserves a special place in hell.

28:33.587 --> 28:35.499
He got a 96!

28:35.505 --> 28:36.336
He...

28:36.340 --> 28:37.456
Are you talking about out of a hundred?

28:37.466 --> 28:38.707
Yeah, well, I mean, it's percentile,

28:38.717 --> 28:40.299
so you can't get higher than 99, but...

28:40.302 --> 28:41.292
Wait, what is all this?

28:41.303 --> 28:42.134
Okay, look.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.673
So, they break it down, right?

28:43.680 --> 28:44.511
Mm-hmm.

28:44.514 --> 28:45.675
There's verbal ability,
spatial relations,

28:45.682 --> 28:46.513
fine motor skills...

28:46.516 --> 28:47.347
Fine motor skills.

28:47.351 --> 28:48.432
Yeah, like how he holds a pencil.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.551
And I was worried about that, too,

28:49.561 --> 28:50.722
'cause he's left-handed, which I mean,

28:50.729 --> 28:52.311
obviously they can't discriminate but...

28:52.314 --> 28:53.521
Okay, but wait, whoa,
you are out of your mind.

28:53.523 --> 28:56.516
Okay, okay, look at the narrative.

28:57.945 --> 29:00.858
Jake was enthusiastic and curious.

29:00.864 --> 29:01.729
Enthusiastic!

29:01.740 --> 29:04.448
And proved remarkably
focused on the task at hand

29:04.451 --> 29:07.034
with a keen eye, he was
able to group pictures

29:07.037 --> 29:08.369
based on common properties,

29:08.372 --> 29:10.409
copying several rows of
symbols to match a code.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.246
What the fuck?

29:11.250 --> 29:12.661
Well, sticks, shapes, and things, relax.

29:12.668 --> 29:13.954
Okay.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.623
Wait, wait, this is my favorite part.

29:15.629 --> 29:18.963
Using an unconventional,
but still affective,

29:18.966 --> 29:22.801
left-handed grip, a delight to work with.

29:25.597 --> 29:26.597
What's wrong?

29:28.475 --> 29:29.591
I don't understand.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.014
I guess Jake had made friends

29:32.020 --> 29:33.682
with one of the girls in his group

29:33.689 --> 29:36.898
and one of the boys overheard
what they were talking about

29:36.900 --> 29:40.018
and uh, that boy told some other boy,

29:40.028 --> 29:41.519
who told some other boy,

29:41.530 --> 29:43.943
who started teasing Jake.

29:43.949 --> 29:44.939
What were they saying?

29:44.950 --> 29:46.691
I don't know, but apparently,

29:46.702 --> 29:48.785
before the teacher could intervene,

29:48.787 --> 29:50.153
things got physical.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.404
They started shoving each other,

29:51.415 --> 29:52.405
I think Jake fell down.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.327
Jesus.

29:53.333 --> 29:56.076
Yeah, and then I guess Jake
shoved the other kid back.

29:56.086 --> 29:57.793
Then I guess he started crying.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.378
But did you tell them
he's not like that?

29:59.381 --> 30:00.417
When has he ever shoved anyone?

30:00.424 --> 30:01.255
Oh, no, no, they knew.

30:01.258 --> 30:02.920
They knew that he was being teased, okay.

30:02.926 --> 30:04.633
The man was really nice about it.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.845
I actually think he was
a little embarrassed.

30:07.848 --> 30:08.679
Why?

30:08.682 --> 30:10.469
Well,

30:10.475 --> 30:12.558
he kept dancing around what had happened,

30:12.561 --> 30:15.224
talking about Jake's creative
role play or whatever

30:15.230 --> 30:18.348
and then suddenly I realized, oh God,

30:18.358 --> 30:19.940
this guy doesn't know how to tell me

30:19.943 --> 30:21.980
that my son was uh,

30:21.987 --> 30:24.525
well, he was the Little
Mermaid, it turns out.

30:24.531 --> 30:25.531
Damn this thing.

30:26.408 --> 30:27.865
Anyway, once it was over, the teacher,

30:27.868 --> 30:29.860
she sat both of them down, they had a talk

30:29.870 --> 30:31.406
about respectful behavior

30:31.413 --> 30:35.077
and she encouraged Jake to
use his words if he was angry.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.202
He couldn't talk.

30:39.212 --> 30:40.123
No, I guess not.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.211
No, no, no, no, I mean,

30:41.214 --> 30:43.126
the Little Mermaid loses her voice.

30:43.133 --> 30:45.921
She can't talk for like half the movie.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.338
You never thought of that?

30:49.598 --> 30:52.056
Well, are you mad at me?

30:52.059 --> 30:55.598
Well, now they're gonna
think he's got anger issues

30:55.604 --> 30:57.721
or doesn't know how to
communicate his feelings.

30:57.731 --> 30:59.347
I should have taken him.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.098
Well, thanks.

31:01.109 --> 31:02.600
No, I'm not saying it's your fault...

31:02.611 --> 31:03.442
Because it's not.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.937
Well, it's a red flag, okay?

31:05.947 --> 31:08.781
They're looking for anything.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.109
Shit.

31:13.997 --> 31:14.987
Well, somehow I was a little more

31:14.998 --> 31:17.911
concerned about Jake than how
it might affect his chances.

31:17.918 --> 31:18.749
Excuse me?

31:18.752 --> 31:19.959
I just...

31:19.961 --> 31:20.917
Maybe we've got things
a little backwards here.

31:20.921 --> 31:22.913
Hey, hey, that is not fair.

31:22.923 --> 31:25.916
Being concerned for his chances
is being concerned for Jake.

31:25.926 --> 31:26.757
Yeah, I realize that.

31:26.760 --> 31:27.876
And frankly, if you're worried about him

31:27.886 --> 31:30.299
being teased at Sibley
Hall, maybe you know,

31:30.305 --> 31:31.637
think about what it'd be like for him

31:31.640 --> 31:33.882
someplace where the teacher's got 40 kids

31:33.892 --> 31:35.474
crammed into a class half the size.

31:35.477 --> 31:36.308
Okay, okay.

31:36.311 --> 31:37.142
You think this won't happen again?

31:37.145 --> 31:38.807
Okay, fine.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.147
So don't tell me I'm
not concerned about Jake.

32:56.850 --> 32:59.593
I mean, okay, I'm not a crazy mom, Alex,

32:59.603 --> 33:01.265
I don't want to hoard him.

33:01.271 --> 33:03.513
I want him to have his father in his life,

33:03.523 --> 33:06.231
but he needs routine right now.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.896
It's so important at this age.

33:07.903 --> 33:08.893
Of course.

33:08.904 --> 33:12.238
I mean, honestly, I
shouldn't even complain, it's,

33:12.240 --> 33:14.778
it's a good thing that
he wants to be involved,

33:14.784 --> 33:16.400
I just...

33:16.411 --> 33:18.277
I honestly think
sometimes it's the lawyers

33:18.288 --> 33:19.654
that make it all impossible.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.239
No offense.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.115
No!

33:23.126 --> 33:24.287
I'm sure you're right.

33:27.297 --> 33:28.378
You ladies need any help?

33:28.381 --> 33:29.417
Yes, I do.

33:29.424 --> 33:31.541
I was looking at the
Power Rangers costumes

33:31.551 --> 33:33.167
and I couldn't see anything in red.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.386
My son's like, yea high.

33:35.388 --> 33:36.924
We may be sold out of that color.

33:36.932 --> 33:37.763
I can check.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.883
Oh, no, no you see, it's,

33:39.893 --> 33:41.850
it really has to be red.

33:41.853 --> 33:42.684
Okay.

33:42.687 --> 33:43.687
Yeah, okay.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.393
So what does Jake want to be, hmm?

33:47.817 --> 33:48.978
Oh, you know, Jake.

33:48.985 --> 33:51.193
He has a different idea every other day.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.442
Probably just grab a few options.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.566
- Yeah, smart.
- Miss?

33:56.576 --> 33:58.033
Oh my God, my hero!

33:58.036 --> 33:59.402
Yes, you found it.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.739
Hey, Teresa,
can we get a price check

34:02.749 --> 34:05.287
on a baby Frankenstein kit?

34:05.293 --> 34:06.293
Thanks.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.725
Maybe we should explain to him

34:23.728 --> 34:26.766
why Rapunzel's not a good idea.

34:27.983 --> 34:28.983
I just think...

34:31.235 --> 34:32.443
What if someone says something

34:32.445 --> 34:34.107
or even a funny look?

34:34.114 --> 34:35.114
I know.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.408
You know, it's our job to protect him.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.123
Meredith.

34:46.960 --> 34:47.960
Come on.

34:49.379 --> 34:50.210
You really don't have to stay.

35:04.686 --> 35:07.975
There's a good chance he'll just forget.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.188
Why?

35:10.191 --> 35:11.898
Why can't I be Rapunzel?

35:11.901 --> 35:12.812
Did you see the pirate?

35:12.819 --> 35:14.060
- No!
- It's awesome!

35:14.070 --> 35:16.027
It's got these tassels!
- No!

35:16.031 --> 35:16.862
No, no!

35:16.865 --> 35:17.696
You've got all
these other options.

35:17.699 --> 35:18.530
Hey, buddy, come on.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.364
Mommy's trying really hard to...

35:19.367 --> 35:20.198
It's not fair!

35:20.201 --> 35:21.032
Jake.

35:21.036 --> 35:21.867
I don't
understand, you promised me!

35:21.870 --> 35:24.328
You haven't even
looked at them, babe.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.163
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat.

35:26.166 --> 35:27.828
I hate you!

35:27.834 --> 35:29.826
Jake, I need you to calm down.

35:29.836 --> 35:31.122
Please.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.745
Just for one second.

35:32.756 --> 35:33.587
You're not, you can't...

35:33.590 --> 35:34.546
Happy Halloween.

35:34.549 --> 35:39.465
Listen, if you're...

36:06.623 --> 36:07.623
No.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.703
He was Ben.

36:10.710 --> 36:14.203
He just had the face of
the man from the bodega.

36:14.214 --> 36:18.049
Like the man from the bodega
was playing Ben in my dream.

36:19.219 --> 36:20.460
Okay.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.678
And we get to
the top of the mountain.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.263
Mm-hmm.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.552
And the snaps on my pack pop off

36:26.559 --> 36:29.723
and all of my gear just falls off,

36:29.729 --> 36:31.140
just rolling down this ravine

36:31.147 --> 36:33.935
and I'm watching it go
and I know this is bad,

36:33.942 --> 36:36.400
but for some reason I just start laughing.

36:37.946 --> 36:40.154
So I guess I'm wondering,
what does that mean?

36:42.492 --> 36:43.858
Well, that depends.

36:43.868 --> 36:44.984
Yeah, I know.

36:44.994 --> 36:47.611
I'm just wondering what
you think it means.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.488
I mean, just give me your two cents.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.245
I mean, isn't that why we're here?

36:55.505 --> 36:57.417
I think that's less important

36:57.424 --> 36:58.335
than your own associations.

36:58.341 --> 36:59.172
Oh my god!

36:59.175 --> 37:00.586
I'm sorry, are you always like this?

37:00.593 --> 37:01.593
Or just here?

37:03.555 --> 37:04.636
I'm sorry.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.301
I think we should end early today.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.552
You're allowed
to feel frustrated.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.973
Yeah, I know I'm allowed.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.721
With me, I mean.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.567
What am I like?

37:26.161 --> 37:27.161
Switzerland.

37:29.122 --> 37:32.615
That's what Ben and I call you.

37:33.543 --> 37:35.409
'Cause when I first started coming,

37:35.420 --> 37:37.707
he would always ask me
whose side you were on.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.206
I told him

37:40.216 --> 37:41.627
you don't like taking sides.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.774
Whoa, slow down, boys.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.082
Greg!

38:23.092 --> 38:24.003
Nice to see you.

38:24.010 --> 38:24.841
Oh, hey.

38:24.844 --> 38:25.880
Hi.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.628
I just, I got here early today,

38:27.639 --> 38:29.631
so I figured I would just, I don't know,

38:29.641 --> 38:32.054
check in, see if there were any updates.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.097
Truth is I haven't talked
to Bethany this week,

38:34.103 --> 38:36.015
but we spoke on Friday and she said

38:36.022 --> 38:38.981
that Jake had actually
been a little better.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.440
Better?

38:40.443 --> 38:43.231
I mean, I just meant the schools.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.321
Oh.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.734
What's up with Bethany?

38:46.741 --> 38:50.906
No, there were, uh, one
or two incidents in class.

38:50.912 --> 38:53.780
I spoke with Alex about
it briefly over the phone.

38:54.874 --> 38:55.910
She didn't tell me.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.664
Uh, here, honey, come on in.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.669
It was nothing serious.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.668
He's always liked doing
things his own way.

39:06.678 --> 39:07.839
You know that.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.053
Yes.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.968
But lately, according to Bethany,

39:11.975 --> 39:14.683
he's been a little more...

39:15.812 --> 39:16.812
Obsessive?

39:17.730 --> 39:19.892
Refusing to leave the dress-up corner

39:19.899 --> 39:22.858
when it's time to move
on to something else.

39:22.861 --> 39:26.229
He'll act out the uh,
oh, what do you call it?

39:26.239 --> 39:28.322
The stroke of midnight.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.781
Over and over again.
- Oh, right.

39:29.784 --> 39:30.615
Right.

39:30.618 --> 39:31.483
Bong, bong, bong.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.486
Yeah, wait come back!

39:33.496 --> 39:35.488
I don't even know your name.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.080
Exactly.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.120
Alex says he's been fine at home.

39:41.838 --> 39:45.627
No, no, he's just, it's,
he's been a handful lately.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.295
It's normal stuff.

39:53.016 --> 39:57.977
Alex thinks that maybe we need to set

39:59.647 --> 40:02.139
better boundaries, so that Jake can learn

40:02.150 --> 40:03.766
a little more self control.

40:04.736 --> 40:05.736
Do you agree?

40:06.779 --> 40:08.987
It's just that I also
know that she's not...

40:10.074 --> 40:12.657
She's not totally herself right now.

40:12.660 --> 40:13.696
And I don't blame her.

40:13.703 --> 40:15.239
You know, she's scheduling everything,

40:15.246 --> 40:17.909
the interviews, the tours.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.533
For a while there she was
nauseous every other morning.

40:20.543 --> 40:21.659
She's been sick?

40:24.464 --> 40:25.671
Oh, shit.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.000
Please don't tell anyone.

40:29.010 --> 40:29.841
Oh, I won't, I won't.

40:29.844 --> 40:30.709
I just, we're not telling anyone

40:30.720 --> 40:31.585
till we're past 13 weeks, you know?

40:31.596 --> 40:32.427
I understand.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.921
She told people sooner last time

40:33.932 --> 40:34.763
and then when we lost the baby...

40:34.766 --> 40:36.473
I know how hard she took it.

40:39.020 --> 40:41.353
I just know how much she respects you.

40:41.356 --> 40:42.642
She always has.

40:42.649 --> 40:46.188
And I was thinking if you do talk to her

40:46.194 --> 40:47.194
that maybe...

40:48.488 --> 40:52.198
You could try to reassure her
that nothing's wrong, just,

40:52.200 --> 40:53.657
that things are gonna be okay.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.446
I'd like to show you something.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.456
If you have a minute.

41:01.834 --> 41:05.123
He did these last Thursday.

41:06.756 --> 41:10.045
I was going to show Alex,
but as long as you're here.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.462
Jake did these?

41:15.473 --> 41:16.473
Mm-hmm.

41:19.519 --> 41:20.680
But they don't...

41:20.687 --> 41:21.894
They don't look like his.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.354
I mean, I get it, it's...

41:29.779 --> 41:30.779
That's a lot of blood.

41:32.031 --> 41:34.865
Well, the blood's one thing.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.735
A lot of children are fascinated by it.

41:37.745 --> 41:39.077
And justifiably so.

41:40.331 --> 41:44.450
But sometimes artwork like
this can be an opportunity.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.577
It can help us understand something

41:46.587 --> 41:50.331
a child might be having
difficulty communicating.

41:58.099 --> 42:01.263
Do you ever see children in your practice?

42:01.269 --> 42:02.100
Uh, no.

42:02.103 --> 42:04.811
Couples, occasionally,
but mostly individuals.

42:04.814 --> 42:05.814
Why?

42:06.941 --> 42:08.273
I guess it's beside the point.

42:08.276 --> 42:12.987
I was uh, just curious if Jake has,

42:14.073 --> 42:17.111
you know, ever expressed
concern to either of you

42:17.118 --> 42:18.118
about his gender.

42:19.537 --> 42:20.537
No.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.285
I mean, I don't think so.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.502
There's a curiosity maybe.

42:29.505 --> 42:32.122
Um, he asked once, we were having dinner,

42:32.133 --> 42:37.003
and he asked why boys can't wear skirts.

42:37.013 --> 42:39.221
You know, 'cause girls can wear pants.

42:40.516 --> 42:41.632
What'd you tell him?

42:41.642 --> 42:42.758
We told him the truth, I guess,

42:42.769 --> 42:45.682
which is there is no good reason, really.

42:47.148 --> 42:50.141
But then I mentioned that um, in Scotland

42:50.151 --> 42:54.441
men wear kilts, which
are kinda like skirts.

42:54.447 --> 42:57.235
We Google imaged kilts,
looked at some pictures.

42:58.201 --> 43:00.318
He wasn't very impressed.

43:01.788 --> 43:04.781
So you didn't tell him there are men

43:04.791 --> 43:07.408
who do wear dresses in our culture?

43:18.387 --> 43:21.095
You talk to Judy at all recently?

43:22.225 --> 43:24.137
Week before last maybe.

43:24.143 --> 43:25.143
Why?

43:28.064 --> 43:31.307
I was just wondering if we might want to

43:31.317 --> 43:33.309
bring Jake to see someone.

43:33.319 --> 43:34.435
A professional.

43:34.445 --> 43:35.310
Why?

43:35.321 --> 43:38.189
It's a lot of change
all at once, you know?

43:39.325 --> 43:40.941
We visited a bunch of schools.

43:40.952 --> 43:42.068
Right.

43:42.078 --> 43:43.740
I mean, and if he's
already having trouble

43:43.746 --> 43:46.864
regulating his you know, I mean...

43:49.836 --> 43:51.748
Maybe it could be helpful.

43:51.754 --> 43:53.916
You don't think that
might make things worse?

43:53.923 --> 43:54.923
How?

43:56.342 --> 43:57.549
I don't know.

43:57.552 --> 43:58.963
He's only four.

44:00.763 --> 44:02.675
We put him in therapy and then there's,

44:03.975 --> 44:06.638
suddenly there's a stranger
asking all these questions.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.601
You know that's not how it works.

44:10.189 --> 44:11.054
But what if he starts thinking

44:11.065 --> 44:12.101
there's something wrong with him?

44:12.108 --> 44:14.065
That's not what I'm saying.

44:14.068 --> 44:16.776
No, I know it's not,
but, you know, it's...

44:18.906 --> 44:21.023
I don't know, it's the
message he might get.

44:28.916 --> 44:30.578
Kids are moody.

44:30.585 --> 44:31.585
He'll be fine.

44:38.801 --> 44:41.009
Okay, I think it's time
that we clean all this up

44:41.012 --> 44:41.843
and get ready to go home.

44:41.846 --> 44:43.428
♪ Clean up everybody clean up ♪

44:43.431 --> 44:45.798
Jake, I'd like you to come
out and help us, please.

44:45.808 --> 44:46.639
Come on, Jake.

44:46.642 --> 44:47.473
No.

44:47.476 --> 44:49.638
I really, really, really
need your help to clean up

44:49.645 --> 44:52.058
because we're getting ready to go home.

44:52.064 --> 44:52.895
Come on, Jake.

44:52.899 --> 44:53.810
Jake, I'd like you
to come out and help us

44:53.816 --> 44:55.557
clean this up.

44:55.568 --> 44:56.568
Please?

45:01.949 --> 45:03.315
Do you need help in there?

45:13.794 --> 45:14.910
Sandra, hi.

45:14.921 --> 45:16.583
It's Greg Wheeler.

45:16.589 --> 45:18.581
I thought we were scheduled for 2PM today.

45:18.591 --> 45:20.674
Um, maybe you're on your way.

45:20.676 --> 45:23.214
Or maybe something came up.

45:23.221 --> 45:26.510
Anyway, call me back so we can reschedule.

45:26.515 --> 45:27.515
If we need to.

45:42.365 --> 45:44.072
Here you go, bud.

45:44.075 --> 45:46.067
You working on your states again?

45:46.077 --> 45:46.908
Yeah.

45:46.911 --> 45:48.191
Oh, I bet that's your grandma.

45:51.082 --> 45:52.289
Ah, Catherine!

45:52.291 --> 45:53.247
You are a lifesaver.

45:53.251 --> 45:54.082
I'm so sorry.

45:54.085 --> 45:55.621
We had a sitter lined up.

45:55.628 --> 45:57.745
She's very reliable, I have no
idea what happened this time.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.212
Well, I don't know why
you would pay anyone.

45:59.215 --> 46:00.877
- Well...
- I've told Alex

46:00.883 --> 46:03.296
a thousand times, I'm happy
to have my time with you both.

46:03.302 --> 46:04.338
And that's very sweet, we just,

46:04.345 --> 46:05.256
we know that you're busy.

46:05.263 --> 46:06.094
Hi, Mom, hi.

46:06.097 --> 46:06.928
Here do you want me to...

46:06.931 --> 46:07.762
Hi, honey.

46:07.765 --> 46:09.927
Oh, I ran into Simon Weingold.

46:09.934 --> 46:11.596
He was asking after you.

46:11.602 --> 46:12.968
Said they're missing you terribly.

46:12.979 --> 46:13.935
Aw, that's nice of him.

46:13.938 --> 46:14.928
And I said with Jake
in school next year,

46:14.939 --> 46:18.023
you're gonna have a lot
more time on your hands.

46:18.025 --> 46:18.981
Uh, Jake!

46:18.985 --> 46:20.192
Come say hi to Nana.

46:20.194 --> 46:21.355
I still need Montana.

46:21.362 --> 46:22.694
Honey, no time to curl your hair?

46:22.697 --> 46:24.905
How often do you go
out for goodness sakes?

46:24.907 --> 46:26.990
Well, wear it behind if you can't, yeah.

46:28.411 --> 46:29.652
Oh, what have we got here?

46:29.662 --> 46:32.370
Oh, that's from the dress-up
corner at Jake's school,

46:32.373 --> 46:33.204
his teacher let him take it.

46:33.207 --> 46:34.243
Let me see it.

46:34.250 --> 46:37.743
Oh, no need to explain, I
do read the New York Times.

46:37.753 --> 46:39.961
God forbid anything should be off limits.

46:39.964 --> 46:40.795
So um...

46:40.798 --> 46:42.505
Where is my favorite grandson?

46:42.508 --> 46:43.999
His dinner's ready in the fridge,

46:44.010 --> 46:45.546
just zap it in the microwave
two, three minutes.

46:45.553 --> 46:47.340
Set the timer...
- Remember, keep it behind.

46:47.346 --> 46:48.177
Yeah, I have used a microwave before.

46:48.180 --> 46:49.546
Oh, and the super is right downstairs.

46:49.557 --> 46:51.549
If you need anything, just knock.

46:51.559 --> 46:53.642
He stays there, he's almost always home.

46:53.644 --> 46:55.977
I did raise two of my own.

46:55.980 --> 46:57.312
You remember that, don't you?

46:57.315 --> 46:58.146
Very true.

46:58.149 --> 46:58.980
Thank you.

46:58.983 --> 46:59.814
Okay, put a brush
through your hair, honey.

46:59.817 --> 47:00.648
- Okay.
- Really.

47:00.651 --> 47:01.482
Thank you again.

47:01.485 --> 47:02.316
Love you.
- All right, bye bye.

47:02.320 --> 47:05.028
- Thank you.
- Bye bye.

47:05.031 --> 47:07.489
Here I come, ready or not!

47:07.491 --> 47:09.574
Yeah, marketing has got to
be fascinating in that way,

47:09.577 --> 47:11.944
just the whole trying to
get inside people's heads.

47:11.954 --> 47:14.037
It must be such a creative challenge.

47:14.040 --> 47:16.123
You know, it is not
about being creative.

47:16.125 --> 47:17.536
That's what people don't get.

47:17.543 --> 47:18.704
Well, I think you're creative.

47:18.711 --> 47:20.623
Thank you, but you gotta understand.

47:20.629 --> 47:23.588
People are up against so
many goddamn options...

47:23.591 --> 47:24.877
- Do you want some?
- No.

47:24.884 --> 47:26.500
For everything, right?

47:26.510 --> 47:29.127
I mean, you walk into
a market you see like,

47:29.138 --> 47:31.221
twenty different kinds of
water for Christ's sake?

47:31.223 --> 47:32.430
I mean, so the best marketing strategy

47:32.433 --> 47:33.219
is not about being creative...

47:33.225 --> 47:34.261
- Here.
- Greg, I said no.

47:34.268 --> 47:35.099
I'm not gonna eat it anyway.

47:35.102 --> 47:36.309
No, it's about being direct.

47:36.312 --> 47:38.019
It's about being simple.

47:38.022 --> 47:42.187
And ultimately, people and
look, I'll just say this,

47:42.193 --> 47:45.231
I'm sorry, especially women,

47:46.197 --> 47:48.735
they wanna be told what to do.

47:48.741 --> 47:51.609
No, we don't.

47:51.619 --> 47:53.235
I call complete bullshit on that.

47:53.245 --> 47:54.110
It's not bullshit.

47:54.121 --> 47:54.952
So much bullshit.

47:54.955 --> 47:56.366
Can I get anyone another round?

47:56.374 --> 47:57.205
Yeah.

47:57.208 --> 47:59.416
I would love another drink, uh...

47:59.418 --> 48:00.249
I'm sorry.

48:00.252 --> 48:01.959
What is your favorite
specialty cocktail?

48:01.962 --> 48:03.123
Ah, case in point.

48:03.130 --> 48:04.166
No, that's not what I'm doing.

48:04.173 --> 48:05.209
I'm asking her opinion.

48:05.216 --> 48:06.502
I really
like the elderflower...

48:06.509 --> 48:07.340
Hold on, I can't hear you.

48:07.343 --> 48:09.585
Um, yeah, sure I'll have one of those.

48:09.595 --> 48:11.086
Thank you.

48:11.097 --> 48:11.928
What's going on?

48:11.931 --> 48:12.931
I'm so sorry.

48:13.933 --> 48:14.933
He what?

48:17.228 --> 48:18.059
I'll be back.

48:18.062 --> 48:19.062
Yeah, okay.

48:20.564 --> 48:21.520
Calm down.

48:21.524 --> 48:23.060
No, no, I understand.

48:23.067 --> 48:24.228
What happened?

48:24.235 --> 48:25.817
He threw Cinderella at her.

48:25.820 --> 48:26.651
What?

48:26.654 --> 48:28.646
The figurine.

48:29.990 --> 48:30.990
Look...

48:31.700 --> 48:33.441
Look, just put him on the phone, okay?

48:33.452 --> 48:34.452
I want to talk to him.

48:35.996 --> 48:37.862
Yeah, well tell him if
he doesn't stop now,

48:37.873 --> 48:39.284
we're canceling his birthday party.

48:39.291 --> 48:40.247
I'm serious.

48:40.251 --> 48:41.082
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

48:41.085 --> 48:41.916
No, let me talk to her.

48:41.919 --> 48:42.750
Let me talk to her, come here.

48:42.753 --> 48:43.539
Hey.

48:43.546 --> 48:44.377
Hi, Kate, it's Greg.

48:44.380 --> 48:45.211
I'm so sorry.

48:45.214 --> 48:46.045
Do you need us to come home?

48:46.048 --> 48:46.879
That's exactly what he wants.

48:46.882 --> 48:47.882
What's that?

48:48.676 --> 48:49.676
No, I know.

48:51.595 --> 48:53.461
No, we'll leave the phone on so you...

48:55.891 --> 48:56.891
Right, okay, well.

48:58.185 --> 48:59.016
Bye.

48:59.019 --> 49:01.136
I mean, he's not an idiot,
he knows what he's doing.

49:01.147 --> 49:03.139
Well, yeah, I mean, honestly
if you're this upset about it

49:03.149 --> 49:04.515
you might consider listening to me.

49:04.525 --> 49:05.732
Maybe we should bring him to see someone.

49:05.734 --> 49:07.020
Okay, can we not do this right now?

49:07.027 --> 49:08.814
He just assaulted his grandmother.

49:08.821 --> 49:10.153
Well, she's probably exaggerating.

49:10.156 --> 49:12.364
Okay, you threatened to
cancel his birthday party

49:12.366 --> 49:13.857
because she's probably exaggerating?

49:13.868 --> 49:15.734
Greg, I was setting a boundary.

49:15.744 --> 49:16.575
That's allowed.

49:16.579 --> 49:17.740
Yeah, it is, but don't flip it around

49:17.746 --> 49:18.577
and try to minimize it.

49:18.581 --> 49:19.617
If he's acting out, he's acting out.

49:19.623 --> 49:21.910
Greg, he's a kid!

49:21.917 --> 49:24.580
God forbid he should be a
little more aggressive than you.

49:30.301 --> 49:32.008
I'm so sorry, guys.

49:32.011 --> 49:33.047
No, of course.

49:33.053 --> 49:34.043
Is everything okay?

49:34.054 --> 49:35.010
Oh, you know.

49:35.014 --> 49:37.597
He's just punishing us
for having a night out.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.341
You know, maybe I should go.

49:39.351 --> 49:40.637
Greg, we offered.

49:40.644 --> 49:41.475
I know, but I just think
that if one of us was there...

49:41.479 --> 49:44.893
We can't just upend our plans
every time he's in a mood.

49:44.899 --> 49:46.015
Where's the lesson in that?

49:46.025 --> 49:47.561
Fine, you're the boss.

49:47.568 --> 49:48.399
Here you are, miss.

49:48.402 --> 49:49.267
The elderflower saki tea.

49:49.278 --> 49:50.564
Thank you, perfect timing.

49:50.571 --> 49:51.982
Cheers to grown up time.

49:51.989 --> 49:53.275
Cheers.

49:54.200 --> 49:57.944
So, Caitlyn Jenner.

49:57.953 --> 50:00.161
Is she a lesbian now or what?

50:00.164 --> 50:01.029
What?

50:01.040 --> 50:03.202
Well, okay, so I was
listening to this interview

50:03.209 --> 50:06.498
where um, he, she...

50:06.504 --> 50:09.588
Well, yeah, Miss Jenner,
uh, she said that she was

50:09.590 --> 50:12.503
still attracted to women and you know,

50:12.510 --> 50:14.502
even though now she's a...

50:14.512 --> 50:16.970
So I was just wondering is she,

50:16.972 --> 50:17.803
like what is she now?

50:17.806 --> 50:18.637
Is she a lesbian?
- I'm sorry,

50:18.641 --> 50:19.722
how did we get on to...

50:19.725 --> 50:22.308
I know, I was just, I have no idea.

50:22.311 --> 50:24.473
You know, he watches so much TV.

50:24.480 --> 50:25.311
Stop.

50:25.314 --> 50:26.145
I was just reminded of it because

50:26.148 --> 50:28.891
when you were outside we
were talking about your son.

50:30.903 --> 50:34.396
I was just explaining that...

50:35.908 --> 50:38.366
I was just saying it's hard, you know.

50:38.369 --> 50:40.907
Admissions time,
kindergarten, it's so hard

50:40.913 --> 50:43.621
for a child, you know who...

50:43.624 --> 50:45.536
Who what?

50:45.543 --> 50:48.331
Who has a unique expression, Alex...

50:48.337 --> 50:50.420
Listen, hey, you
know, my brother, Mikey,

50:50.422 --> 50:55.383
when he was a kid, he was
obsessed with that uh,

50:55.386 --> 50:58.754
that game Pretty Pretty
Princess and you know,

50:58.764 --> 51:01.632
you cut to freshman year of college

51:01.642 --> 51:04.851
and he's on the football team,
200 pounds six foot three.

51:04.853 --> 51:05.764
So, it just goes to show you...

51:05.771 --> 51:07.763
I'm not sure I follow this.

51:07.773 --> 51:09.389
I'm just saying that you may,

51:09.400 --> 51:12.643
you probably don't need
to worry, that's all.

51:12.653 --> 51:14.019
No one's worried.

51:14.029 --> 51:15.065
That's not what he meant.

51:15.072 --> 51:15.903
Well, that's not exactly true.

51:15.906 --> 51:16.987
I'm a little worried.

51:16.991 --> 51:18.983
And so are his teachers, apparently.

51:18.993 --> 51:19.904
All right, you know what?

51:19.910 --> 51:20.946
Amal, let me ask you something.

51:20.953 --> 51:24.242
You took Sanjay to see a
therapist last year, right?

51:24.248 --> 51:25.204
Greg.

51:25.207 --> 51:27.199
I'm sorry, is that a taboo subject?

51:27.209 --> 51:28.825
I just, we're all friends here.

51:28.836 --> 51:30.077
I think you've had
a little too much to drink.

51:30.087 --> 51:31.419
I just am curious

51:31.422 --> 51:34.711
about your experience as a parent.

51:34.717 --> 51:35.833
And it's fine.

51:37.177 --> 51:39.419
Well, with the divorce
we wanted to be safe,

51:39.430 --> 51:40.966
so I took him to a therapist.

51:40.973 --> 51:41.804
Thank you.

51:41.807 --> 51:44.265
Okay, well that was a
very different situation.

51:44.268 --> 51:45.099
How is that different?

51:45.102 --> 51:46.434
Because with Sanjay there
was an obvious problem.

51:46.437 --> 51:48.269
What do you mean by that?

51:48.272 --> 51:49.638
No, no, not problem, I...

51:49.648 --> 51:50.479
Right.

51:50.482 --> 51:52.064
No, no, no, I just meant,

51:52.067 --> 51:54.229
you know, there was
something external, not...

51:54.236 --> 51:55.772
just how he likes to play.
- I think we should just,

51:55.779 --> 51:56.610
I really think we should
just drop this right now.

51:56.614 --> 51:58.697
It's more than how he likes to play.

51:58.699 --> 51:59.530
What's that supposed to mean?

51:59.533 --> 52:00.364
It means...

52:00.367 --> 52:01.198
What?

52:01.201 --> 52:02.032
What were you going to say?

52:02.036 --> 52:02.867
We can talk about it later.

52:02.870 --> 52:03.986
No, what?

52:03.996 --> 52:04.827
Let's have it.

52:04.830 --> 52:05.661
What were you gonna say?

52:05.664 --> 52:06.664
We're all friends, right?

52:07.875 --> 52:08.740
Fine.

52:08.751 --> 52:11.334
Uh, I was giving Jake
a bath the other night

52:11.337 --> 52:14.956
and he tucked his penis
between his legs, okay?

52:14.965 --> 52:17.127
All boys do that.

52:17.134 --> 52:18.500
Right?

52:18.510 --> 52:19.421
- Well, not really.
- Sure.

52:19.428 --> 52:21.920
Oh, come on, you're
saying Sanjay's never...

52:21.930 --> 52:22.761
No.

52:22.765 --> 52:24.552
And you're saying he's done this before?

52:24.558 --> 52:26.595
Well, it's bath time.

52:26.602 --> 52:28.559
What am I supposed to say, no?

52:28.562 --> 52:30.349
Clearly you're the one
who had a problem with it.

52:30.356 --> 52:31.767
I didn't say I had a problem with it.

52:31.774 --> 52:34.016
I said that there are
people who specialize

52:34.026 --> 52:35.733
in exactly this type of behavior.

52:35.736 --> 52:37.773
Frankly, I'm not sure
what Jake needs right now

52:37.780 --> 52:39.066
is one more adult in his life

52:39.073 --> 52:40.530
gossiping behind his back.

52:40.532 --> 52:41.363
Oh my god.

52:41.367 --> 52:42.824
Trying to come up
with some sort of diagnosis.

52:42.826 --> 52:44.442
No one was gossiping,
Alex, you need to really...

52:44.453 --> 52:45.364
I'm sorry, I didn't
realize we were talking about

52:45.371 --> 52:46.202
a disease here.

52:46.205 --> 52:47.036
It's just...

52:47.039 --> 52:49.497
Hey, can I interest
anyone in some dessert?

52:49.500 --> 52:50.331
We're good.

52:50.334 --> 52:51.541
Just...

52:51.543 --> 52:52.543
Just the check.

53:33.752 --> 53:34.913
Okay.

53:34.920 --> 53:37.833
You can just take a seat back there.

53:40.134 --> 53:41.545
How much have I gained?

53:41.552 --> 53:44.260
Three pounds since last time.

53:44.263 --> 53:47.802
So a total of almost five.

53:49.393 --> 53:50.975
I feel like with my son it was more.

53:50.978 --> 53:53.436
Yeah, it varies, but it's definitely

53:53.439 --> 53:54.555
within the normal range.

53:56.150 --> 54:00.235
And your iron was a little low last time.

54:00.237 --> 54:03.150
I'm taking the
supplement he recommended.

54:18.088 --> 54:20.421
Take a deep breath.

54:20.424 --> 54:25.385
Okay.

54:28.056 --> 54:29.137
Just breathe.

55:04.802 --> 55:06.418
Hey!

55:06.428 --> 55:07.259
Hi, Kimmy!

55:07.262 --> 55:08.093
Good Lord!

55:08.096 --> 55:10.053
That's almost as big as Jake.

55:10.057 --> 55:11.173
Yeah, well, I kept the receipt.

55:11.183 --> 55:12.299
I know he's particular.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.892
Um, you guys know Amal, right?

55:14.895 --> 55:15.806
- Hi.
- Hi.

55:15.813 --> 55:17.054
Nice to see you!

55:17.064 --> 55:18.064
How are you?

55:19.650 --> 55:21.642
Oh, my goodness gracious.

55:22.736 --> 55:23.567
Hi, Mom.

55:23.570 --> 55:24.401
Oh, hi, honey.

55:24.404 --> 55:25.770
Don't you look nice?

55:25.781 --> 55:26.646
Who is uh...

55:26.657 --> 55:29.149
Hi, Kimmy, how are you doing?

55:33.288 --> 55:35.075
Kimmy, we don't run inside!

55:35.082 --> 55:36.994
It's a giant teddy bear.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.037
Can I hold it?

55:39.044 --> 55:39.875
Can I see it?

55:39.878 --> 55:41.744
Everybody, it's
for Jake, it's his present.

55:41.755 --> 55:43.997
It's his birthday, thank you.

56:01.149 --> 56:02.560
You need some help, sweetheart?

56:02.568 --> 56:03.604
No, I'm almost done.

56:03.610 --> 56:04.441
Ah.

56:04.444 --> 56:05.400
My daughter the baker.

56:05.404 --> 56:07.691
You know I wish you wouldn't do that.

56:07.698 --> 56:09.155
What?

56:09.157 --> 56:11.774
Like all this is just...

56:11.785 --> 56:12.901
A waste of time.

56:14.288 --> 56:17.076
I wasn't...

56:17.082 --> 56:20.371
I just meant you didn't
learn that from me.

56:26.008 --> 56:27.544
Stop it!

56:27.551 --> 56:28.837
Hey, stop it, Sanjay!

56:28.844 --> 56:30.631
What is the matter with you, baby?

56:30.637 --> 56:31.627
What happened?

56:31.638 --> 56:33.675
Sanjay pushed Bobby.

56:33.682 --> 56:37.050
He started it because
Bobby called Jake a flag.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.060
Oh.

56:39.730 --> 56:40.730
Flag?

56:44.109 --> 56:44.940
Jake, honey.

56:44.943 --> 56:46.184
Hey, Mom, no, no, no, no, I got it.

56:46.194 --> 56:47.194
I got it.

56:57.539 --> 56:58.539
Hey.

57:01.084 --> 57:02.084
Hey, you okay?

57:03.879 --> 57:05.586
It's almost time to make a wish.

57:09.551 --> 57:11.042
Babe, come on.

57:13.680 --> 57:14.680
Honey.

57:16.141 --> 57:18.599
Honey, talk to me, please?

58:18.704 --> 58:20.787
You know, just...

58:20.789 --> 58:22.155
Excuse me one moment.

58:22.165 --> 58:23.165
Sure.

58:31.049 --> 58:31.880
Laurel.

58:31.883 --> 58:32.714
It's gotta stop.

58:32.718 --> 58:34.334
Look, I know that you're
with a client right now

58:34.344 --> 58:35.960
and I really hate to
interrupt, but this is...

58:35.971 --> 58:37.337
I'm not with a client.

58:38.849 --> 58:39.680
What?

58:39.683 --> 58:41.891
I said I'm not with a client.

58:45.230 --> 58:46.766
You seem angry.

58:46.773 --> 58:48.685
Is there something you need to release?

59:04.791 --> 59:06.077
Well, we'll
talk to you next week.

59:06.084 --> 59:07.074
Thank you so much.

59:07.085 --> 59:08.451
Fingers crossed.

59:09.921 --> 59:11.162
Right on time.

59:11.173 --> 59:12.835
Yeah, got some good news for us?

59:14.092 --> 59:15.092
Come on in.

59:18.597 --> 59:22.887
Okay, but this is
preliminary feedback, right?

59:22.893 --> 59:24.600
They haven't made their decisions.

59:24.603 --> 59:25.468
That's true.

59:25.479 --> 59:28.017
So, is there any chance
one could still end up

59:28.023 --> 59:29.355
accepting him?

59:29.357 --> 59:32.600
It's possible, but I have to be honest.

59:32.611 --> 59:34.773
At this point it's unlikely

59:34.780 --> 59:36.521
it would come with financial aid.

59:36.531 --> 59:38.864
What about the magnets?

59:38.867 --> 59:40.358
BSI, PS20?

59:40.368 --> 59:42.075
We'll know more in a few weeks.

59:42.079 --> 59:44.036
But his scores were so high.

59:44.039 --> 59:45.746
They were very strong.

59:45.749 --> 59:47.115
But the cutoffs go up every year.

59:47.125 --> 59:48.741
There's just too much demand.

59:50.504 --> 59:53.668
So you're saying he could
be shut out everywhere?

59:54.841 --> 59:57.458
I'm saying we need to be prepared.

01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:02.923
You know, this is a numbers game.

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:03.764
We knew this.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.258
I mean, we went to public school.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.476
We turned out okay, right?

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:09.892
Remember, he could also
do another year with us,

01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:11.309
reapply next fall.

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:15.105
I know it's not ideal, but
under the circumstances,

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:17.229
I think it might be
the best thing for him.

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:19.234
What do you mean?

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:20.106
She's just listing options.

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:21.653
I mean, if the gifted
programs don't work out.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.778
No, but, but what circumstances?

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:26.370
Look.

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:28.706
There's no question he's bright.

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:32.122
He's creative, that comes
across in all of the feedback.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:36.214
But several places also
note that he gets stubborn

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.299
and defensive when
dealing with other kids.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.509
Frankly, you two are very lucky to be

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:43.550
raising a kid like Jake now
instead of 50 years ago,

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:44.923
even 20 years ago.

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:46.799
And what exactly does that mean?

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:47.971
A kid like Jake?

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:48.809
Okay, you know what,
I think we're getting

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:49.643
off-topic here.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.512
Alex, I'm very sorry that this isn't

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:52.764
the news we were hoping for,

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:55.266
but you have to understand
the number of spots

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:56.108
we're talking about.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:58.979
Of course, and I know how
many kids you have to place.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:02.403
Whoa, I'm not sure what
you're implying here,

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:05.117
but you know that I care
very deeply about Jake,

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.362
which is why I'm doing
everything in my power

01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:09.364
to place him somewhere where he feels safe

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:10.740
and comfortable enough to...

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:12.286
To dress like a girl.

01:01:12.294 --> 01:01:13.125
Okay.

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:14.744
That's obviously what you're saying.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:15.585
Alex...

01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:17.751
And maybe the problem is that we all

01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:19.123
started pitching him as some kind of...

01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:19.965
Alex, he had no idea
what was in that essay.

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:21.300
It doesn't matter.

01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:23.169
Obviously it's going to affect the way

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.011
that people treat him.

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:26.722
I'm talking about him
feeling safe and respected.

01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:27.556
Yes!

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:29.391
But isn't there a danger of imposing...

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:32.558
Imposing what exactly?

01:01:32.564 --> 01:01:35.557
No, not imposing.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:37.103
That was...

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:38.110
That...

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:40.190
Greg.

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:43.315
Alex, do you think my sexual orientation

01:01:43.325 --> 01:01:46.739
has anything to do with my
advice regarding your son?

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:47.576
What?

01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:48.410
Judy, of course not.

01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:50.746
Because every time I try
to bring up my concerns,

01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:53.787
you respond like I'm pushing
some political agenda.

01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:56.706
And let me tell you, the
impulse to embrace children

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.170
as they are is not an agenda.

01:01:58.173 --> 01:01:59.505
No, I never said...

01:01:59.507 --> 01:02:00.338
And like it or not,

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:02.129
you two have some choices to make here.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:03.046
There's a problem.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:05.841
If you don't believe me, just
read the feedback yourself.

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:08.260
He's acting out verbally, physically.

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:10.508
He is and I mean, maybe...

01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:14.512
Maybe he's sick of us, of us
pushing him into this role.

01:02:14.522 --> 01:02:15.603
Alex, you can't expect him

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:17.690
to never realize he's different.

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:20.480
No, but I can wait
until he tells me himself.

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:22.023
But it sounds like he's trying,

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:23.566
but you're just determined to ignore it.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:24.529
I am not ignoring it, Jesus!

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:26.945
Okay, okay, okay.

01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:28.989
Maybe if you had ever had your own kids.

01:02:34.376 --> 01:02:35.376
You know what?

01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:37.376
We're done, okay?

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.059
Ah!

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:16.081
And I'll come grab him.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:19.873
Um, I guess I'll just,
I'll text you when we're...

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.165
No, no, everything's fine.

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:24.006
Um, it'll be fine.

01:03:24.009 --> 01:03:25.420
Yeah, okay.

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:26.427
Thank you.

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:28.095
Bye.

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:23.190
You should lie down.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:08.904
Here.

01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:18.705
Come on.

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:48.601
I think you should leave.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.490
I'm not going anywhere.

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.325
We don't have to talk,

01:05:57.328 --> 01:05:59.786
but I'm not leaving you alone right now.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:02.247
I don't think I can not talk

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:06.668
if you're here.

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:07.912
I don't think I can...

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:13.877
Not say something, something mean.

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:17.255
I'm very angry.

01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:20.017
I understand.

01:06:21.936 --> 01:06:23.768
I'm angry at you, Greg.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:30.981
You should have said something to Judy.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:32.944
She was out of line and

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:35.405
you just sat there.

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:46.458
We're not gonna have this
conversation right now.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:47.952
Yes, please tell me what conversations

01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:48.793
we're allowed to have.

01:06:48.796 --> 01:06:50.378
Alex, if you need to be
mad at me, that's fine,

01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:51.667
but I am not going to fight.

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:52.664
That is really the last thing I...

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.712
You should have said something!

01:06:55.803 --> 01:06:58.716
Well, frankly, I could
barely get a word in.

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:01.090
I was trying to keep
things from escalating.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.763
Right, right, God
forbid anyone gets angry.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:05.887
God forbid you ever piss someone off.

01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:06.853
All right, this is ridiculous.

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:08.973
You're in shock and we're both grieving.

01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:10.099
Oh, thank you.

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:10.940
I'd forgotten.

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:11.900
You're trying to make me feel as much

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:12.939
pain as you do and the irony...

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:14.107
That is not what I'm doing!

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:15.149
Of course it is.

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:16.897
Maybe not consciously, but
that's definitely part of...

01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:19.400
Oh my God, things I could
do without number one:

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:21.242
The fucking unconscious!

01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.112
Please, please spare me that.

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:24.738
Fine, let's blame Freud, right?

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:26.661
It's Freud's fault you miscarried.

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:28.204
Oh, I miscarried?

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:30.248
No, that is not what I...

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:33.214
You think if I'd just
taken better care of myself...

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:34.206
Would you please stop.

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:36.960
If I hadn't overburdened myself

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.006
with Jake's applications?

01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:38.843
Allie, for God's sake.

01:07:38.846 --> 01:07:40.508
If I had let you call an ambulance

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:41.551
instead of taking a cab,

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:42.924
maybe we would have gotten there sooner.

01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:45.051
Yeah, well now we'll
never know, will we?

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.686
Allie, I'm sorry.

01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:56.904
You're an asshole.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:57.771
Jesus.

01:07:57.782 --> 01:07:59.364
This is hard for me, too.

01:07:59.367 --> 01:08:01.074
Is that impossible for you to understand?

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.694
I needed help, Greg.

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:07.540
And you just sat there
like you were embarrassed.

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:08.373
Do you have any idea...

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:09.207
Okay, I'm not gonna do this.

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:10.075
Where are you going?

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.086
Greg!

01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:13.829
Greg, you can't just
walk away in the middle...

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.877
In the middle of what, an argument?

01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:17.124
This is not an argument.

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:18.591
This is you shitting on me.

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:22.341
So I'm gonna go pick up Jake
and I'm gonna take him out

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:24.886
and when I get back, I
hope that you're in bed.

01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:26.975
'Cause frankly, he doesn't
need to see you like this.

01:08:26.978 --> 01:08:27.978
Fine.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.808
Fine!

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:32.522
Yeah, go take him out for ice cream.

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:34.649
And when you're done why don't you both

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:36.439
get your nails done, huh?

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.028
I mean, why not?

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:40.068
It's not like you've
ever taken him to a park

01:08:40.073 --> 01:08:42.157
or thrown a ball in his direction!

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:05.514
That is a disgusting thing to say.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:10.178
You think it's my fault he likes dresses?

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:14.273
Do you think I'm too effete a role model?

01:09:14.274 --> 01:09:15.560
Who the fuck are you?

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:16.399
Greg, that's not...

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:18.734
Did you listen to the feedback?

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:22.652
Stubborn, defensive, did that
not remind you of anyone?

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.399
Not to mention, you're the
one reading him fairy tales

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:25.274
every night.

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:28.245
You're the one buying him
every Disney Princess DVD

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.363
you can get your hands on

01:09:29.374 --> 01:09:32.537
and then freaking out when
people start to notice.

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:35.286
I mean, is it any wonder he's confused?

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:38.004
You know, maybe the reason I
didn't say anything to Judy

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:40.249
is because I agree with her.

01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:42.966
I think we need to make some choices

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:44.801
about how to address the situation.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:45.636
Fine.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.006
You know, bring him to a
shrink, what do I know, right?

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:50.680
I'm just the one at home
with him all day, every day!

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:53.100
- Oh, for God's sake!
- What?

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:55.348
You get to have a life
outside this apartment!

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:56.189
I gave that up.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:57.353
You wanna go back to work, do it.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.191
No one's stopping you.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:09:59.025
No, no!

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.190
I made a choice to be here because

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:03.564
I wanted him to have a
mother who's devoted.

01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:05.816
And because you hated being a lawyer!

01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:06.783
Christ!

01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:09.620
Don't pretend like you
weren't desperate to get out!

01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:11.238
This is what you wanted.

01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:13.286
So I'm sorry if motherhood turns out to be

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:15.534
just another disappointment,
but I am his father.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:17.878
I live here, too, and I
am sick of being treated

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.291
like you're raising him alone.

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:23.376
Jake is not a disappointment.

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:26.591
I said motherhood, not Jake.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:30.015
This is so...

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:33.142
I'm sorry, okay?

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:40.772
I'm sorry for making you so unhappy.

01:10:40.778 --> 01:10:44.362
I'm sorry for taking you for granted.

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:49.076
I'm sorry for all the ways I've
fucked things up with Jake.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:49.989
Allie.

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:53.455
I am, I am sorry about the baby.

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:54.289
No.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:56.158
For whatever I did wrong.

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:58.536
I am not asking you to apologize.

01:10:58.546 --> 01:11:01.505
Just please, please, let's just stop.

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:31.703
It's Judy.

01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:36.782
She called before at the hospital.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:41.248
Just wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:51.839
Well, it's not.

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:34.240
What do you think is holding you back?

01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:37.740
I mean, like I said, it's stupid.

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:38.954
It's just a signature.

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:43.120
It's not like it changes anything.

01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:46.127
His stuff's already gone.

01:13:47.214 --> 01:13:49.957
The financials are straightforward.

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:51.458
There's no custody battle.

01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:57.426
Silver linings, right?

01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:06.557
You know, you never
really talked about that.

01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:09.235
What?

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:12.197
Well...

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:15.951
Kids.

01:14:17.703 --> 01:14:19.365
There's not much to talk about.

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.992
We talked about IVF

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:28.962
and how hard that was on both of you.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.716
But I don't think you ever
mentioned the decision to stop.

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:42.847
Does that matter at this point?

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.440
I think it might.

01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:52.902
It's just my two cents.

01:14:56.701 --> 01:14:59.944
Well, it was always
part of the plan, I guess.

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.452
And when it didn't happen right away,

01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:09.912
we both kept assuming with all the options

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:14.041
the next one, this'll be the one.

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:17.711
Then the one after that.

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:22.716
Then the one after that and
then at a certain point,

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:26.686
I think we both just realized.

01:15:30.067 --> 01:15:31.854
We were eating takeout one night

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:34.899
and he looked at me and said,

01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:41.909
"We're done, aren't we?"

01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:48.793
I guess we were.

01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:53.918
And how did you feel?

01:15:55.593 --> 01:15:56.593
Honestly?

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:04.225
I felt relieved.

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:12.732
I knew how much Ben wanted it.

01:16:15.279 --> 01:16:18.568
I knew it was what I should want.

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:23.161
But...

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.082
I don't know.

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:30.085
I thought...

01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:33.541
Oh, thank God.

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:41.465
You didn't think you could tell him?

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:44.265
I think he knew.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:55.566
It's so quiet in here.

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:59.153
Ah, Dr. Hendricks decided to relocate.

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:10.415
I miss the banshee.

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:29.602
Okay.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:31.980
Here you go.

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:33.815
Thank you.

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:36.568
Judy, I...

01:17:38.946 --> 01:17:40.403
It's really good to see you.

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:47.453
You try...

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:53.249
You try so hard to protect them, but...

01:17:56.589 --> 01:17:59.548
It's never gonna be
easy to really see people.

01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:03.259
Especially the ones we love.

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:09.974
Hon?

01:18:09.977 --> 01:18:10.977
In here.

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:13.432
Alex, hi.

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:14.439
Hi, Lynn.

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:19.861
Hey.

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:23.692
I am gonna go get changed.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:24.699
Okay.

01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:30.987
She hates my guts, doesn't she?

01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:31.954
She'll get over it.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.716
What's the matter with you?

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:52.137
This is a child!

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:53.726
Get off that bike!

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:55.391
You're not in control!

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.810
If I ever see you on a
bike without a helmet,

01:18:57.816 --> 01:19:00.934
it will not be a pretty picture, okay?

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:34.769
Can't sleep?

01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:41.433
I've noticed some
things about this movie.

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:45.278
Things that don't make sense.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:50.237
'Cause the idea is that Cinderella is this

01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:52.281
abused servant girl, right?

01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:55.655
But she's got an entourage of animals

01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:57.407
waiting on her hand and foot.

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:02.166
They bathe her, they dress her.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.462
Honestly, she's not doing too bad.

01:20:23.027 --> 01:20:24.734
It's a good school.

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:30.569
I think he'll be happy.

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.877
You know, when he was a baby,

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.714
I was so convinced he knew things.

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:51.837
I would look at him and
wish so badly he could talk

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:54.305
'cause I was sure he wanted to tell me.

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:00.804
He's got time.

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:06.768
Maybe he'll come around.

01:21:21.919 --> 01:21:22.919
Come to bed.

01:21:54.493 --> 01:21:55.493
Hi.

01:21:59.665 --> 01:22:01.577
Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler?

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:02.583
Come on in.

01:22:03.794 --> 01:22:06.787
Do you know what I've been
meaning to ask you about?

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:09.414
Which one is Aurora again?

01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:11.632
Who's Aurora?

01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:12.466
Aurora?

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:14.335
Yeah, that's who you
dressed up as, isn't it?

01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:15.757
Aurora's Sleeping Beauty.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:16.971
That's right.

01:22:16.974 --> 01:22:19.057
Oh, yes, and they have
those three little fairies

01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:19.890
that travel...

01:22:19.893 --> 01:22:22.806
And they take her to a cottage

01:22:22.813 --> 01:22:25.100
and then she doesn't
know she's a princess.

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:25.938
Mm-hmm.

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:26.977
They can't tell her
and they're all like...

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:34.321
Ready, ready?

01:22:34.324 --> 01:22:36.111
