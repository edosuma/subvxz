00:03.545 --> 00:06.481
This season on "MasterChef,"
everything has changed.

00:09.585 --> 00:13.455
Because this season,
the judges do battle.

00:13.488 --> 00:17.226
Every home cook we bring here
into the MasterChef kitchen...

00:17.259 --> 00:20.095
Is competing
for a MasterChef white apron.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.935
Each of us have
just eight aprons.

00:25.968 --> 00:29.639
Just eight chances to find
America's next MasterChef.

00:31.440 --> 00:35.277
If a judge chooses a home cook
to wear one of our aprons...

00:35.310 --> 00:38.113
We become their mentor.

00:38.147 --> 00:40.115
Gordon:
Previously...

00:40.149 --> 00:41.884
Game on, boys.

00:41.917 --> 00:44.453
...our search for
the next MasterChef began.

00:44.486 --> 00:46.388
One of us is going
to become your mentor.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.057
- ( exhales )
- Who's it gonna be?

00:48.090 --> 00:49.792
Gordon:
15 home cooks impressed us

00:49.825 --> 00:51.727
with their
culinary skills...

00:51.761 --> 00:54.664
- Great job.
- ...earning a coveted
white apron.

00:54.697 --> 00:57.366
- I got an apron from Gordon!
- ( cheering )

00:58.801 --> 01:00.602
Tonight...

01:00.636 --> 01:02.504
only nine aprons remain...

01:02.537 --> 01:05.641
- This is gonna be tough.
- Whoo-hoo!

01:05.675 --> 01:07.910
- ...as the last home cooks...
- Come on!

01:07.943 --> 01:10.145
...scramble for a place
in the competition.

01:10.179 --> 01:11.613
( exhales )
That is one of the best things

01:11.647 --> 01:13.816
I've ever tasted
in this kitchen.

01:13.849 --> 01:15.317
- Gordon: And...
- ( exhales )

01:15.350 --> 01:17.419
- What?
- Joe: What is he doing?

01:17.452 --> 01:20.155
- Gordon: We battle it out.
- ( exhales )

01:20.189 --> 01:22.692
Joe: There is a massive
decision to be made.

01:22.725 --> 01:23.959
Choose wisely.

01:23.993 --> 01:25.695
...to find America's next...

01:25.728 --> 01:27.897
The final apron goes to...

01:29.131 --> 01:30.132
...MasterChef.

01:33.202 --> 01:35.838
Right, let's see
what we've got.

01:35.871 --> 01:38.007
- Joe, how many aprons
you got left?
- I've got two aprons left.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.442
- Two. Aar贸n?
- I think I have
four aprons left.

01:40.475 --> 01:44.646
I've got three.
One of us is gonna find
America's next MasterChef.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.849
- That's right.
- Let the battle begin.

01:46.882 --> 01:49.051
( cheers, applause )

01:49.084 --> 01:51.553
Announcer:
First up are
two talented home cooks

01:51.586 --> 01:53.388
who hope to win
a white apron...

01:53.422 --> 01:54.690
I'm coming out
with an apron, for sure.

01:54.724 --> 01:56.325
...by putting
their own twist

01:56.358 --> 01:58.961
on their family's
fried chicken recipes.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.495
You've had my dad's
tandoori chicken.

02:00.529 --> 02:02.397
It's kind of unreal,
you know it is.

02:02.431 --> 02:04.867
My name is Farhan,
I'm 25 years old,

02:04.900 --> 02:08.203
I live in Chicago, Illinois,
and I'm a third-year
dental student.

02:08.237 --> 02:10.672
My dad has owned
a series of restaurants,

02:10.706 --> 02:13.709
and that's really where
my love of cooking came from.

02:13.743 --> 02:16.645
Whoo-pah.
This is my spice cabinet.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.914
I love to combine
American dishes

02:18.948 --> 02:22.017
and change things up
by using Indian flavors,

02:22.051 --> 02:25.054
and I think that's what's
really gonna set me apart.

02:25.087 --> 02:27.723
My name is Gerron.
I'm 25 years old.

02:27.757 --> 02:30.092
I'm from Louisville, Kentucky,
and I'm an English teacher.

02:30.125 --> 02:33.062
Out of seven siblings,
I'm the first person
in my family

02:33.095 --> 02:35.564
to go to a four-year college
and graduate.

02:35.597 --> 02:37.266
Growing up
in a rough neighborhood,

02:37.299 --> 02:39.401
cooking, for me,
was a way out,

02:39.434 --> 02:40.903
and that's exactly
the opportunity

02:40.936 --> 02:42.404
that I want to provide
for my students.

02:42.437 --> 02:45.207
( cheers, applause )

02:45.240 --> 02:47.777
- Let's get
that chicken, bro!
- Yeah!

02:47.810 --> 02:50.079
Farhan:
"MasterChef" is gonna
give me the platform

02:50.112 --> 02:52.982
to show America
what Indian food is all about.

02:54.884 --> 02:56.718
- Welcome, guys.
- Gerron: Oh, my goodness.

02:56.752 --> 02:59.188
Indian could really be
the next Tex Mex.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.556
All that needs to happen
is it needs to be packaged
in the perfect way,

03:01.590 --> 03:03.692
and I'm the person
to do that.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.560
Both of you, welcome
to the MasterChef kitchen.

03:05.594 --> 03:07.897
- Thank you.
- Aar贸n: Now, to take a place

03:07.930 --> 03:09.598
in the "MasterChef"
competition,

03:09.631 --> 03:12.467
you only have
to impress one of us.

03:12.501 --> 03:15.637
And if you have what it takes
to get more than one offer,

03:15.670 --> 03:20.409
then it's up to you
to choose who you want
to be your mentor.

03:20.442 --> 03:23.145
And if you're smart,
you'll pick me.

03:23.178 --> 03:25.580
( both laugh )

03:25.614 --> 03:29.618
So, it looks like
we have a fried chicken
cook-off comin' our way.

03:29.651 --> 03:31.386
- Fried chicken challenge.
- Yes, we do. Yep.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.588
You have 45 minutes
on the clock.

03:35.357 --> 03:37.659
Time starts... now.

03:37.692 --> 03:39.461
- Let's go, Farhan,
let's turn it up.
- Let's do it, baby.

03:39.494 --> 03:41.797
Making that Mumbai marinade.
What about you, brother?

03:41.831 --> 03:43.598
I hear you.
I'm over here making my brine

03:43.632 --> 03:46.168
for my Nashville chicken.
We gon' turn it up.

03:46.201 --> 03:47.769
You know, it's funny.
There's a lot of camaraderie

03:47.803 --> 03:50.505
between both of them.
They're nice, likeable guys.

03:50.539 --> 03:53.242
But here's the deal.
I need a home cook

03:53.275 --> 03:57.179
with killer instincts,
creativity, heart,
and want to take risks.

03:57.212 --> 03:59.648
My aprons are going
to people

03:59.681 --> 04:01.316
who already have
great palates,

04:01.350 --> 04:03.152
abundant food knowledge,

04:03.185 --> 04:05.420
and real technique
in the kitchen.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.956
Entirely different from me,
let me tell you.

04:06.989 --> 04:08.790
I'm looking for students.

04:08.824 --> 04:11.260
As long as they're
willing to learn,

04:11.293 --> 04:13.495
I'm willing to teach them
everything they need

04:13.528 --> 04:15.297
to become America's
next MasterChef.

04:15.330 --> 04:17.699
- Farhan?
- Yes, sir?

04:17.732 --> 04:20.870
- What's in there?
- This is actually my dad's
secret tandoori chicken blend.

04:20.903 --> 04:22.471
- Wow.
- Yeah.

04:22.504 --> 04:24.273
I adapted it to be buttermilk
instead of yogurt,

04:24.306 --> 04:26.641
and it's my mom's
cilantro coconut chutney.

04:26.675 --> 04:29.611
And we're gonna fry that up
on a buttermilk biscuit.

04:29.644 --> 04:33.015
So it's my family's story,
coming to America, on a plate.

04:33.048 --> 04:35.384
Your story sounds extremely
similar to mine.

04:35.417 --> 04:37.552
- I'd love to hear it.
- Trust me, Aar贸n.

04:37.586 --> 04:39.621
I've been watching you
on TV since I've been
a little boy,

04:39.654 --> 04:41.456
- so this is a dream
come true for me.
- I appreciate it.

04:41.490 --> 04:42.858
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.462
Gentlemen,
25 minutes remaining.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.498
- Yes, Chef.
- Thank you, Chef.

04:49.531 --> 04:51.500
Gordon:
Gerron, give us an insight
into what you're making.

04:51.533 --> 04:53.568
Yes, Chef, I'm making
a Nashville hot chicken

04:53.602 --> 04:55.370
with
a vinaigrette-based slaw

04:55.404 --> 04:57.739
and also
a sweet heat sauce.

04:57.772 --> 04:59.474
It's my mother's recipe,

04:59.508 --> 05:01.643
and so the way we
traditionally do it

05:01.676 --> 05:04.046
is a paper bag,
and you season the flour

05:04.079 --> 05:06.916
to give you that Nashville
smoky, sweet, and spicy.

05:06.949 --> 05:09.318
Gentlemen,
10 minutes left,

05:09.351 --> 05:12.354
the last 10 minutes you have
to finish your dishes.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.858
The spices in this kitchen
are intoxicating.

05:16.892 --> 05:19.061
It smells awesome.

05:19.094 --> 05:20.729
I've had fried chicken
a thousand times,

05:20.762 --> 05:23.032
but Farhan's tandoori chicken
sounds amazing.

05:23.065 --> 05:26.868
Just over 90 seconds to go.

05:26.902 --> 05:28.237
Farhan's got
his biscuits out.

05:28.270 --> 05:31.406
- That's a good biscuit.
- 60 seconds.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.541
There's a lot
on the line tonight.

05:32.574 --> 05:34.209
Gerron,
you got this, brother.

05:34.243 --> 05:37.779
- Got this, dawg. You got it.
- Ten, nine, eight...

05:37.812 --> 05:40.615
Chefs:
Seven, six, five,

05:40.649 --> 05:43.785
four, three, two, one.

05:43.818 --> 05:46.255
And stop.
Hands in the air.
Well done.

05:46.288 --> 05:48.090
- Good job.
- ( chefs clapping )

05:48.123 --> 05:50.392
Gentlemen, bring your dishes
down to the front, please.

05:50.425 --> 05:52.962
Let's go.

05:52.995 --> 05:54.096
Aar贸n: Let's taste.

05:56.298 --> 05:58.400
So, Farhan, tell me
what's in that dish.

05:58.433 --> 06:02.537
Farhan:
What we have here is my
dad's tandoori chicken recipe

06:02.571 --> 06:04.639
on a black pepper
buttermilk biscuit

06:04.673 --> 06:07.142
with my mom's
cilantro chutney

06:07.176 --> 06:09.578
and a tamarind
honey butter.

06:09.611 --> 06:11.080
What should it
look like inside?

06:11.113 --> 06:13.215
So, the chicken should be
nice and moist and juicy.

06:13.248 --> 06:14.483
Hopefully, you should
see a nice glisten.

06:19.288 --> 06:21.790
( exhales )

06:21.823 --> 06:24.493
That is one of the best things
I've ever tasted in this
kitchen.

06:26.962 --> 06:28.263
The texture
from the coconut,

06:28.297 --> 06:29.631
it works beautifully

06:29.664 --> 06:31.766
with the floral nature
of the cilantro.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.935
That chicken is moist,

06:33.969 --> 06:35.570
and none of the spices are
competing with one another.

06:35.604 --> 06:36.771
Thank you, Chef.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.813
Uh, I love it.
It's so nice to see

06:44.846 --> 06:47.749
that Indian culture
blending into the American.

06:47.782 --> 06:48.950
You've nailed it.
Great job.

06:48.984 --> 06:50.119
Thank you, sir.

06:54.889 --> 06:56.691
Ooh, that was
a nice bite right there.

06:59.128 --> 07:01.296
Good dish.
Let me think about it.

07:05.867 --> 07:08.003
Gerron.

07:08.037 --> 07:09.504
Young man, describe
the dish, please.

07:09.538 --> 07:12.141
Gerron:
This is a Nashville
hot chicken

07:12.174 --> 07:14.876
with green cabbage
and a red cabbage slaw

07:14.909 --> 07:18.647
made with a vinaigrette
and a sweet heat sauce.

07:23.218 --> 07:24.953
Love the spice.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.788
- Thank you.
- It's got that heat, sweet.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.857
- And the fire.
- Thank you, Chef.

07:28.890 --> 07:31.626
I just love to have seen
a little bit more finesse
on plating it.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.728
- Yes, Chef.
- But, yeah, your mum
taught you well.

07:33.762 --> 07:35.964
She did.
Thank you, Chef.

07:35.997 --> 07:36.998
Thank you.

07:42.371 --> 07:44.573
Good amount of heat.
Extremely well seasoned.

07:44.606 --> 07:46.741
If I had to change one thing,

07:46.775 --> 07:49.478
don't be afraid of putting
that slaw on the bottom
of that bread.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.012
'Cause that slaw is good.

07:51.046 --> 07:52.447
Thank you, Chef.

07:54.716 --> 07:57.552
Do you feel you have to
spice to others' taste
or to your own taste?

07:57.586 --> 07:59.854
So, for me, Chef,
I spice to others' taste.

07:59.888 --> 08:02.191
But when you eat a Nashville
hot piece of chicken,

08:02.224 --> 08:03.558
you expect it
to be hot, Chef.

08:03.592 --> 08:05.727
- It's good.
- Thank you, Chef.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.097
But his dish
is good, too.

08:08.130 --> 08:11.266
I want someone
who really wants it.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.734
I'm hungry.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.210
Gordon:
Remember, we started out
with eight aprons each,

08:21.243 --> 08:25.013
so we must be
absolutely certain
on who we choose.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.449
You both could leave here
tonight with an apron,

08:27.482 --> 08:31.920
or you may both
end up empty-handed.

08:31.953 --> 08:34.523
Aar贸n: All three of us
might offer you an apron.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.925
If that happens,
it's down to you guys

08:36.958 --> 08:42.364
to decide who you want
to mentor you throughout
this whole competition.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.634
With that said,
Joe, two phenomenal
performances.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.769
Any of them good enough
to give an apron?

08:52.674 --> 08:53.875
Gordon: Wow.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.610
( exhales )

08:59.581 --> 09:01.483
I like both of you.

09:01.516 --> 09:04.186
But today I'd like
to offer it...

09:06.521 --> 09:08.123
...to Gerron.

09:08.157 --> 09:09.191
Yes.

09:11.193 --> 09:14.729
What I like about you
is you have the hunger.

09:14.763 --> 09:15.964
Thank you, Chef.

09:15.997 --> 09:17.666
Over to you, Aar贸n.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.842
I'm gonna offer
this apron to...

09:29.844 --> 09:31.846
...you, Farhan.

09:33.182 --> 09:34.316
Don't let me down.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.652
( indistinct conversation )

09:37.686 --> 09:41.523
Home cooks, it's not over.
Someone else might offer
you an apron.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.127
( breathes deeply )

09:52.367 --> 09:54.969
Oh-ho.

09:55.003 --> 09:57.038
There are gonna be
some decisions
to be made.

09:57.071 --> 09:58.207
Aar贸n:
I'm telling you.

10:00.175 --> 10:02.444
- ( exhales )
- ( exhales )

10:02.477 --> 10:04.746
Two strong dishes.

10:06.915 --> 10:08.383
( exhales )

10:08.417 --> 10:09.851
But there's something
in this individual

10:09.884 --> 10:13.988
that I think
can go far.

10:21.863 --> 10:24.499
Two strong dishes.

10:26.535 --> 10:28.002
( exhales )

10:28.036 --> 10:29.404
But there's something
in this individual

10:29.438 --> 10:33.208
that I think
can go far.

10:36.945 --> 10:38.447
Whoa.

10:43.885 --> 10:47.322
So, there is a massive
decision to be made here.

10:47.356 --> 10:50.692
- Oh, man.
- In a moment.

10:50.725 --> 10:54.829
Gerron, you have got
my seventh apron.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.399
Now, put that apron on,
and let's see that smile,

10:57.432 --> 11:02.271
because you've got yourself
the greatest mentor in the
history of "MasterChef."

11:03.272 --> 11:04.906
Team Joe.

11:04.939 --> 11:08.777
Now, my friend,
Farhan, big decision.

11:08.810 --> 11:10.579
What I'm most excited
about you, Farhan,

11:10.612 --> 11:12.881
is you understand
how important food is

11:12.914 --> 11:17.118
to tell your story
and how much you want
to make your parents proud.

11:17.151 --> 11:20.054
Farhan, your family,
your history, that's
very important.

11:20.088 --> 11:23.758
You've got a great foundation,
but you've got a long way to go,

11:23.792 --> 11:28.397
and I can turn you,
young man, into America's
next MasterChef.

11:28.430 --> 11:29.964
( sighs )

11:29.998 --> 11:32.867
Just reach out
and put your hand

11:32.901 --> 11:36.037
on the apron of the chef

11:36.070 --> 11:38.106
that you decide
will be your mentor.

11:38.139 --> 11:40.275
( sighs )
Man.

11:46.681 --> 11:50.051
- Sorry, Gordon.
No hard feelings.
- Whoo!

11:50.084 --> 11:52.053
So, what do you think,
Chef?

11:52.086 --> 11:53.288
Well, first of all,
I'm delighted.

11:53.322 --> 11:54.656
It was a tough decision.

11:54.689 --> 11:56.325
Both of you put
a great foot forward,

11:56.358 --> 11:58.059
and you're gonna get someone
that's gonna be with you

11:58.092 --> 12:00.128
- every step of the way.
- Gordon: Well done, you two.

12:00.161 --> 12:01.963
But you've got the worst
two mentors you could've picked.

12:01.996 --> 12:04.566
( laughs )

12:04.599 --> 12:07.669
- Good night.
- Oh, yeah!

12:09.203 --> 12:10.505
- Yes!
- Let's do this, boy.

12:10.539 --> 12:11.973
- Yes, baby.
- Well done.

12:12.006 --> 12:14.743
I can't believe
I said no to Gordon, man.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.811
I know.
Oh, my gosh.

12:16.845 --> 12:18.980
Oh, yes.

12:19.013 --> 12:21.616
( cheers, applause )

12:26.521 --> 12:29.190
Yeah! Yeah!

12:29.223 --> 12:30.759
- We did it.
- We did it, bro!

12:30.792 --> 12:32.461
Both:
We did it!

12:32.494 --> 12:35.664
I'm so proud and
happy for you.
Who did you get?

12:35.697 --> 12:38.333
- Aar贸n!
- ( screams )

12:38.367 --> 12:40.535
Aar贸n and I just had
an instant connection.

12:40.569 --> 12:42.637
We both bonded
over the immigrant story.

12:42.671 --> 12:44.873
He's done for Mexican food

12:44.906 --> 12:46.307
is what I want to do
for Indian food,

12:46.341 --> 12:48.510
and for me this is
a dream come true.

12:48.543 --> 12:51.446
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.682
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you, baby.

12:53.715 --> 12:55.149
You did it.

12:55.183 --> 12:56.985
Today is the best day
of my life.

12:57.018 --> 12:59.220
I'm on cloud nine.
I'm speechless.

12:59.253 --> 13:00.689
Nothing can
take me down right now.

13:03.925 --> 13:06.828
Man.
That dish is good.

13:06.861 --> 13:08.296
Aar贸n:
He's just getting started.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.199
I got the next MasterChef
right there

13:11.232 --> 13:13.802
- with me along this ride.
- Yeah?

13:13.835 --> 13:15.904
I have
a two-seat car, buddy,

13:15.937 --> 13:19.541
and he's riding right
next to me, all right?
Into the sunset.

13:22.043 --> 13:23.144
Tye:
Thank you guys.
I'm ready.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.579
You got me ready.

13:24.613 --> 13:26.981
Announcer:
Up next, three home cooks

13:27.015 --> 13:29.718
who put their twist
on Gordon Ramsay classics.

13:29.751 --> 13:31.753
I have a lot to live up to.
I can't fail.

13:31.786 --> 13:33.655
Go hard or go home.

13:33.688 --> 13:36.925
I'm Tye, I'm 42 years old,
I'm from Laurel, Maryland,

13:36.958 --> 13:38.326
and I'm an
assistant professor.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.861
This is a slam dunk, right?

13:39.894 --> 13:42.664
I'm 6'3",
and for nine years

13:42.697 --> 13:44.866
I lived and breathed
basketball.

13:44.899 --> 13:46.435
That was my life.

13:46.468 --> 13:47.936
Ooh, ready?

13:47.969 --> 13:50.004
Basketball's taken me
all across the country

13:50.038 --> 13:51.372
and internationally as well,

13:51.406 --> 13:53.608
which has given me
the opportunity

13:53.642 --> 13:56.545
to taste foods I never
would've imagined.

13:56.578 --> 13:59.414
Cooking is a way for me
to bond with my family.

13:59.448 --> 14:01.850
- Going all the way.
Thank you.
- You're gonna, Mom.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.018
I'm ready to give it my all,
and I want that apron.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.555
Whip these people
in-- into shape.

14:06.588 --> 14:08.289
- Yep, I'm gonna do it.
- Like the kids, there we go.

14:08.322 --> 14:10.191
- We got it.
- I'm Alecia,
I'm 30 years old,

14:10.224 --> 14:11.893
I'm from Grand Rapids,
Michigan,

14:11.926 --> 14:13.628
- and I'm a day care owner.
- Come on in.

14:13.662 --> 14:15.764
I take care of all
two-year-olds,

14:15.797 --> 14:17.766
so my life is crazy.

14:17.799 --> 14:20.802
And this,
my friends, is where
all the magic happens.

14:20.835 --> 14:24.272
I cook for my kids,
I cook for my daycare kids,
I cook for my husband,

14:24.305 --> 14:26.575
and my style of food
is comfort food,

14:26.608 --> 14:28.577
so it'll warm your soul.

14:28.610 --> 14:30.579
My food is like
a big ol' hug.

14:30.612 --> 14:31.946
- I love you.
- That's right, man.

14:31.980 --> 14:34.916
Getting to cook
for Gordon Ramsay,

14:34.949 --> 14:36.718
I can't tell you
how excited I am.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.419
( cheers, applause )

14:38.453 --> 14:39.988
My name's Darrick,
I'm 34 years old,

14:40.021 --> 14:41.823
and I'm an aviation
systems engineer

14:41.856 --> 14:43.157
from Peoria, Arizona.

14:43.191 --> 14:45.393
( cheering )

14:45.426 --> 14:47.261
I'm a self-taught cook,
but I've actually been

14:47.295 --> 14:48.963
to quite a few of Gordon
Ramsay's restaurants

14:48.997 --> 14:50.932
and been so inspired
by the dishes that he made

14:50.965 --> 14:54.268
that I've turned it into
this amazing love for cooking.

14:54.302 --> 14:57.572
- Good to see
all three of you.
- Thank you, Chef.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.641
I'm gonna prove myself
in the MasterChef kitchen

14:59.674 --> 15:01.075
to everybody in America,

15:01.109 --> 15:03.678
especially Gordon Ramsay.

15:03.712 --> 15:04.746
Right, welcome.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.681
Now, three home cooks,

15:06.715 --> 15:10.018
each doing a Gordon Ramsay
signature dish

15:10.051 --> 15:12.253
- in the MasterChef kitchen.
- Wow.

15:12.286 --> 15:16.357
You three are either brave,
foolish,

15:16.390 --> 15:17.959
or both, probably.

15:17.992 --> 15:19.961
( laughs )

15:19.994 --> 15:23.131
Gordon has just
three aprons left.

15:23.164 --> 15:26.568
If you get an apron
from Gordon tonight,
it'll be a miracle.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.777
Joe: Three home cooks,
each doing

15:35.810 --> 15:37.946
a Gordon Ramsay
signature dish

15:37.979 --> 15:39.814
- in the MasterChef kitchen.
- Wow.

15:39.848 --> 15:44.452
You three are either brave,
foolish,

15:44.485 --> 15:45.987
or both, probably.

15:46.020 --> 15:47.989
( laughs )

15:48.022 --> 15:51.192
Gordon has just
three aprons left.

15:51.225 --> 15:54.596
If you get an apron
from Gordon tonight,
it'll be a miracle.

15:57.231 --> 15:59.333
Now, listen carefully.

15:59.367 --> 16:01.335
We started out
with eight aprons each,

16:01.369 --> 16:03.838
so, for the first time,
our reputation is on the line,

16:03.872 --> 16:06.007
so we take these decisions
so seriously.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.844
Now, to win an apron
and a place in "MasterChef,"

16:09.878 --> 16:13.648
your food, this year,
has to convince
at least one of us

16:13.682 --> 16:16.651
that you are worthy
of that incredible apron.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.688
If more than one of us
offer you an apron,

16:19.721 --> 16:23.758
then you get to choose your
mentor across this competition.

16:23.792 --> 16:25.059
Joe: Are you three
home cooks ready?

16:25.093 --> 16:26.060
- Yes, Chef.
- Absolutely,

16:26.094 --> 16:27.195
Born ready.

16:27.228 --> 16:30.431
Your 45 minutes
starts...

16:30.464 --> 16:31.933
now.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.874
So, three home cooks
walk into this kitchen

16:39.908 --> 16:42.010
with the bravado
of replicating

16:42.043 --> 16:44.378
three of your
signature dishes, Gordon,

16:44.412 --> 16:48.082
but they're gonna
interpret your dishes
with their own flair.

16:48.116 --> 16:50.184
I mean, I've never seen
anything like this before, ever.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.020
It does make me
slightly anxious

16:52.053 --> 16:54.689
because these guys tonight
are doing it on their own,

16:54.723 --> 16:56.457
and in 45 minutes.

16:56.490 --> 16:59.293
I mean,
it is a tall order.

16:59.327 --> 17:01.429
Alecia: How we feelin', guys?
Feelin' good?

17:01.462 --> 17:02.530
- Heck, yeah.
- You ready for this?

17:02.563 --> 17:04.232
Ready.

17:04.265 --> 17:07.201
We're 10 minutes in.
35 minutes remaining.

17:07.235 --> 17:09.638
- How's it going?
- Doing all right.
Little behind.

17:09.671 --> 17:13.274
- Let's get it.
- Okay, Alecia, tell us,
what is your dish?

17:13.307 --> 17:16.811
Today I'm making
my fish and chips.
It's called Oh, My Cod,

17:16.845 --> 17:19.714
with a lemon
aioli dipping sauce

17:19.748 --> 17:21.449
and also
a tartar sauce as well.

17:21.482 --> 17:24.719
That's very dangerous,
the batter, the fries.

17:24.753 --> 17:27.221
- Why fish and chips?
- My husband can eat anything

17:27.255 --> 17:28.623
that's fried,
smothered, and covered.

17:28.657 --> 17:31.259
I met him and he was
way too skinny

17:31.292 --> 17:32.827
and I fattened him up
40 pounds.

17:32.861 --> 17:35.630
- 40 pounds on your husband?
- 40 pounds, yes.

17:35.664 --> 17:37.465
( laughs )

17:37.498 --> 17:39.533
Let's go, guys.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.637
Darrick,
what is your dish?

17:42.671 --> 17:44.639
A rendition
of Gordon Ramsay's

17:44.673 --> 17:46.574
sticky toffee pudding
with dates.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.077
Wow.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.278
Do you have any idea
how difficult that is?

17:50.311 --> 17:51.813
We haven't got three hours.

17:51.846 --> 17:53.748
Sir, I'm gonna get it done
in 45 minutes,

17:53.782 --> 17:55.083
and you are going to
love it.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.351
This thing
takes months to master.

17:57.385 --> 18:00.021
Why try that now, tonight,
with such short time?

18:00.054 --> 18:01.656
Sir, this is a dish that--

18:01.690 --> 18:04.592
I fell in love with it
at one of your restaurants.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.294
So you're gonna try
to imitate the master

18:06.327 --> 18:08.529
or are you gonna
try to reinvent it?

18:08.562 --> 18:11.165
Well, Chef, I do know
for a fact that Chef Ramsay

18:11.199 --> 18:13.968
tends to steam
his sticky toffee pudding.

18:14.002 --> 18:16.170
Today, mine will be baked.

18:16.204 --> 18:18.940
- Okay.
- You've got to get
that in the oven.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.208
They take 20 minutes
to cook.

18:20.241 --> 18:21.475
- Yes, Chef.
- Come on.

18:24.846 --> 18:26.815
Gordon: Tye, give us
an insight to the dish.

18:26.848 --> 18:28.549
My family, we like
to come together over food,

18:28.582 --> 18:30.151
and, typically, we have
really big cookouts.

18:30.184 --> 18:32.320
And we love burgers.

18:32.353 --> 18:36.190
So I am making
a grilled lamb burger with
an olive tapenade sauce,

18:36.224 --> 18:39.060
a Mediterranean cucumber
and tomato salad

18:39.093 --> 18:40.461
with a Greek vinaigrette.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.497
A lamb burger
is so unforgiving.

18:43.531 --> 18:45.834
What fat did you
put in the middle
in order to help it?

18:45.867 --> 18:47.869
I used the panko
and milk breading

18:47.902 --> 18:50.571
to kind of bind it and make it
a little bit more moist.

18:50.604 --> 18:52.373
- Best of luck.
- Thank you very much.

18:52.406 --> 18:54.242
Gordon: Just under
20 minutes to go.

18:58.947 --> 19:01.750
We always speculate on
what's the most difficult dish.

19:01.783 --> 19:03.351
Tonight we can get the answer.

19:03.384 --> 19:05.820
Gordon, what is the most
difficult dish of the three?

19:05.854 --> 19:08.356
Oh, without shadow of a doubt,
the sticky toffee pudding.

19:08.389 --> 19:10.358
Oh, it's starting to caramel.

19:10.391 --> 19:11.993
You know, Joe,
it's a finessed,

19:12.026 --> 19:13.762
unctuous, rich dessert

19:13.795 --> 19:15.596
that takes time to rise,
time to cook,

19:15.629 --> 19:17.866
and more importantly,
that incorporation of dates,

19:17.899 --> 19:20.368
you know, it's a bugger
to get right.

19:20.401 --> 19:23.037
Darrick, his biggest problem is,
if they're undercooked

19:23.071 --> 19:24.839
and he starts to tip it out...

19:24.873 --> 19:26.407
- Plop.
- ...plop.

19:26.440 --> 19:27.776
I don't know
if mine's gonna fully cook.

19:33.314 --> 19:34.949
Alecia, I mean,
look at the fish.

19:34.983 --> 19:36.684
The fish is out on the tray,

19:36.717 --> 19:39.020
so what's gonna happen in
the next three or four minutes,

19:39.053 --> 19:40.855
the batter's gonna go
really soggy

19:40.889 --> 19:42.390
and it's gonna be a mess.

19:42.423 --> 19:45.526
I would not be cooking
the fish before the fries.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.361
- Alecia: How you doing, Tye?
- I'm doing good, yup.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.430
- Trying to close it out,
how about you?
- Good.

19:49.463 --> 19:52.066
Tye, she's put the burgers
in the oven.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.267
If they're still in the oven,

19:53.301 --> 19:55.236
those lamb burgers
are overcooked.

19:55.269 --> 19:58.306
They are big, so I'm just hoping
that she takes them out

19:58.339 --> 19:59.607
and lets them rest.

20:02.443 --> 20:04.578
Darrick, two minutes to go.

20:04.612 --> 20:05.613
Yes, Chef.

20:05.646 --> 20:07.215
And yours are still in the oven.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.083
- Yes, Chef.
- And there's no toffee
on there.

20:09.117 --> 20:10.584
- No, Chef.
- Are you mad?

20:10.618 --> 20:11.619
Yes, Chef.

20:11.652 --> 20:13.154
Is it time
to change your plan?

20:13.187 --> 20:14.455
Or change your pants.

20:38.212 --> 20:39.413
Two minutes to go.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.448
Yes, Chef.

20:40.481 --> 20:42.016
And yours are still in the oven.

20:42.050 --> 20:43.918
- Yes, Chef.
- And there's no toffee
on there.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.419
- No, Chef.
- Are you mad?

20:45.453 --> 20:46.454
Yes, Chef.

20:46.487 --> 20:47.989
Is it time
to change your plan?

20:48.022 --> 20:49.290
Or change your pants.

20:52.193 --> 20:54.028
I love this guy.
What about you, Joe?

20:54.062 --> 20:55.263
I'm not so sure.

20:55.296 --> 20:56.630
The proof will
be in the pudding.

20:56.664 --> 20:58.299
Come on, Darrick,
make it work here.

20:58.332 --> 20:59.667
Alecia:
Come on, guys, keep it together.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.371
He's got 'em out.

21:05.739 --> 21:07.876
60 seconds remaining.

21:07.909 --> 21:08.910
What?

21:10.378 --> 21:12.146
Make sure you love it, come on.

21:12.180 --> 21:14.548
- Ooh, those chips look good.
- Tye: Good, good.

21:14.582 --> 21:16.150
Gordon:
This is it.

21:16.184 --> 21:18.286
Ten, nine...

21:18.319 --> 21:20.821
Judges:
Eight, seven, six,

21:20.855 --> 21:25.659
five, four, three, two, one.

21:25.693 --> 21:27.195
And stop.

21:27.228 --> 21:28.897
- Hands in the air.
- Alecia: Good job, guys.

21:28.930 --> 21:31.332
- Very good job, well done.
- You got it, you got it..

21:31.365 --> 21:33.935
Very carefully, please bring
your dishes down to the front.

21:38.706 --> 21:42.676
So, three crazy home cooks

21:42.710 --> 21:45.513
came in here tonight
to win an apron

21:45.546 --> 21:48.382
with your signature
dishes, Gordon.

21:48.416 --> 21:49.750
Let's get this started.

21:53.421 --> 21:56.190
Right, so, Alecia,
describe the dish, please.

21:56.224 --> 21:57.858
Alecia:
Today I present fish and chips

21:57.892 --> 22:01.362
with a lemon garlic aioli
and tartar sauce,

22:01.395 --> 22:03.564
with seasoned fries.

22:03.597 --> 22:04.765
How'd you make the batter?

22:04.798 --> 22:06.567
I used rice flour

22:06.600 --> 22:08.836
with soda water,
all-purpose flour,

22:08.869 --> 22:10.571
little bit of beer,
and egg.

22:10.604 --> 22:12.106
It's good.

22:12.140 --> 22:14.208
What wasn't right tonight
was your timing.

22:14.242 --> 22:15.876
That fish didn't
need to be cooked

22:15.910 --> 22:17.878
until at least four
or five minutes to go.

22:17.912 --> 22:19.447
That way,
it's crisp on the outside,

22:19.480 --> 22:21.782
but the basics are there,
let me tell you.

22:21.815 --> 22:23.084
- Yes, Chef.
- Thank you.

22:27.655 --> 22:29.390
- Excellent sauces.
- Thank you.

22:36.764 --> 22:38.399
The batter needs help,

22:38.432 --> 22:40.734
but the fish is well-seasoned
and flaky and moist.

22:40.768 --> 22:44.305
The tartar sauce is really
herbaceous and fun.

22:44.338 --> 22:45.739
- Well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

22:48.176 --> 22:50.744
Darrick,
describe the dish, please.

22:50.778 --> 22:53.948
Darrick:
Today I have made you
a sticky toffee pudding

22:53.982 --> 22:56.517
with dates
and a caramel topping.

23:26.347 --> 23:28.449
Did Gordon like it?

23:28.482 --> 23:30.851
Honestly, Chef, I don't know
if Chef Ramsay liked it.

23:37.358 --> 23:39.427
The beauty of
this particular cake

23:39.460 --> 23:42.163
is it has to be
seasoned well.

23:42.196 --> 23:44.498
And you did that with
the spice mixture in there.

23:44.532 --> 23:47.635
It's rich, and you gotta
be careful with that.

23:47.668 --> 23:48.802
Yes, Chef, thank you.

23:59.413 --> 24:00.548
- Tye.
- Hi, Chef.

24:00.581 --> 24:02.383
Explain the dish, please.

24:02.416 --> 24:04.152
Tye:
I have a grilled lamb burger

24:04.185 --> 24:06.020
with an olive tapenade sauce

24:06.054 --> 24:08.322
and a Mediterranean cucumber
and tomato salad

24:08.356 --> 24:09.590
with a Greek vinaigrette.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.062
So I'm hoping when I slice
in here, it's not bright white.

24:16.897 --> 24:18.699
- They look moist.
- ( exhales )

24:24.905 --> 24:28.076
So, you cooked
the burgers beautifully.

24:28.109 --> 24:32.313
But you've put so much milk
and bread in that patty,

24:32.346 --> 24:33.914
it's actually wet.

24:33.947 --> 24:35.549
So there's like a soggy
taste in the center,

24:35.583 --> 24:37.885
which is really weird.

24:37.918 --> 24:40.121
Listen, it's good,
it's not brilliant.

24:45.593 --> 24:48.062
I love the idea
of the grilled onions.

24:48.096 --> 24:50.564
They're sweet.
They counterbalance
the gaminess of the lamb.

24:50.598 --> 24:52.533
All the other components
are really speaking to me.

24:52.566 --> 24:54.902
It's just the texture's off
with the patty.

24:54.935 --> 24:56.204
Thank you, Chef.

24:59.873 --> 25:02.143
- Nice cook on it.
- Thank you.

25:06.447 --> 25:08.716
The overall flavors
are nice.

25:08.749 --> 25:10.618
Thank you, Chef.

25:10.651 --> 25:13.954
Whoever gave you the idea
of putting bread and milk

25:13.987 --> 25:15.089
in a hamburger?

25:15.123 --> 25:17.391
My mom.

25:17.425 --> 25:19.560
Mother doesn't always
know best.

25:19.593 --> 25:20.994
I'm finding that out, Chef.

25:23.931 --> 25:25.533
Aar贸n: Let me remind you
of something.

25:25.566 --> 25:28.035
We started with
eight aprons each.

25:28.068 --> 25:31.405
So we're picking our mentees
extremely wisely,

25:31.439 --> 25:35.643
but at the same time, you only
have to impress one of us.

25:35.676 --> 25:39.447
Some of you actually did
better than I expected.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.815
I've only got
one apron left,

25:41.849 --> 25:44.985
so this is a big
decision for me.

25:47.288 --> 25:48.489
I'm gonna say...

25:48.522 --> 25:50.624
Alecia no.

25:50.658 --> 25:54.295
Darrick, I'm afraid
it's a no for me.

25:54.328 --> 25:57.765
And, Tye, good try, but just
too many mistakes for me.

25:57.798 --> 25:59.133
Thank you, Chef.

25:59.167 --> 26:00.434
Well, I don't agree with you.

26:12.112 --> 26:13.981
I do have an apron.

26:20.053 --> 26:21.689
Two.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.550
Three crazy home cooks

26:49.583 --> 26:52.620
came in here tonight
to win an apron

26:52.653 --> 26:54.555
with your signature
dishes, Gordon.

26:56.357 --> 26:57.891
( sniffling )

27:03.764 --> 27:05.366
- What's he doing?
- What?

27:12.273 --> 27:15.175
That was amazing.

27:15.209 --> 27:16.844
That was
as good as mine.

27:19.780 --> 27:21.715
Keep on cooking like that,

27:21.749 --> 27:24.818
you are going far.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.754
Get an apron on.

27:26.787 --> 27:27.855
Good job.

27:27.888 --> 27:29.122
Thank you so much.

27:30.090 --> 27:31.659
( crying )

27:31.692 --> 27:33.727
- Oh, my God.
- Gordon: Wow.

27:33.761 --> 27:37.097
( cheering and applause )

27:37.130 --> 27:39.533
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Open!

27:41.302 --> 27:43.737
Come on, Darrick!

27:43.771 --> 27:47.575
- Oh!
- ( clamoring )

27:47.608 --> 27:49.877
I just got an apron

27:49.910 --> 27:51.879
from Gordon freaking Ramsay.

27:51.912 --> 27:54.181
- Oh, my God!
- I'm so proud of you.

27:54.214 --> 27:56.116
Darrick:
He liked my dish so much,

27:56.149 --> 27:58.686
that he honored me
with three of his aprons.

27:58.719 --> 28:00.521
It'd be nice to keep all three
and have extra lives

28:00.554 --> 28:03.957
like a video game,
but I don't think I get that.

28:03.991 --> 28:05.593
Oh, Daddy's gonna
be so proud of you.

28:05.626 --> 28:06.894
Oh, my God.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.864
So, Aar贸n,

28:10.898 --> 28:13.066
are one of these
two home cooks

28:13.100 --> 28:14.968
worthy of
one of your aprons?

28:18.138 --> 28:19.973
( sighs )

28:39.793 --> 28:42.296
( cheering )

28:44.798 --> 28:48.669
Yeah!

28:48.702 --> 28:50.771
Yes!

28:50.804 --> 28:53.341
Aw! Good job, Mom.

28:53.374 --> 28:55.776
Even thought I'm disappointed
not to get a MasterChef apron...

28:55.809 --> 28:57.244
- We're proud of you, Mom.
- Aw, thank you.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.812
...Darrick and Alecia
are great cooks

28:58.846 --> 29:01.615
and I hope one of them
wins the next MasterChef.

29:03.651 --> 29:06.454
Announcer:
As Alecia and Darrick
join the top 24...

29:10.324 --> 29:13.126
...Gordon and Aar贸n
have two just aprons each

29:13.160 --> 29:16.630
and Joe has just one
final apron remaining.

29:16.664 --> 29:18.298
Oh, my God.

29:18.332 --> 29:19.700
Gordon:
Welcome, come on down.

29:19.733 --> 29:21.301
Announcer:
And, with so few spots

29:21.335 --> 29:22.970
left in the competition...

29:23.003 --> 29:24.271
Gordon:
The stakes are high.

29:24.304 --> 29:26.006
You're battling, we're battling.

29:26.039 --> 29:27.975
...the bar has been raised.

29:28.008 --> 29:30.611
- Woman: No!
- This time...

29:30.644 --> 29:33.514
there is no room
for any excuses.

29:33.547 --> 29:34.982
Announcer:
Only the most skilled...

29:35.015 --> 29:36.817
Sal's pasta looks spot-on.

29:36.850 --> 29:39.119
- ...confident...
- I am doing lobster bake soup.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.188
- Sounds wicked good.
- It is wicked good.

29:41.221 --> 29:43.190
...and creative home cooks...

29:43.223 --> 29:44.492
I'm impressed.

29:44.525 --> 29:46.460
I would hire you
in a second flat.

29:46.494 --> 29:48.128
Thank you, Chef.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.398
...earned a place
in the MasterChef kitchen.

29:50.431 --> 29:52.299
- Lindsey.
- Thank you, Chef.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.034
- Stephanie.
- Thank you, Chef.

29:54.067 --> 29:55.869
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

29:55.903 --> 29:57.971
Boy, do I see potential.

29:58.005 --> 29:59.707
- Announcer: And...
- Sal.

29:59.740 --> 30:02.175
...with Joe handing out
his final apron...

30:02.209 --> 30:06.313
( cheering and screaming )

30:06.346 --> 30:10.384
...Gordon and Aar贸n are left
with just one apron each...

30:10.418 --> 30:12.352
( music playing )

30:12.386 --> 30:14.488
...as the final home cooks
of the night

30:14.522 --> 30:16.356
compete for
the two remaining spots

30:16.390 --> 30:19.159
- in the top 24.
- I'm Juni.

30:19.192 --> 30:22.062
I'm a disability analyst
from Raleigh, North Carolina.

30:22.095 --> 30:23.163
Hi!

30:23.196 --> 30:24.932
I would consider myself

30:24.965 --> 30:26.934
a middle-aged
suburban housewife

30:26.967 --> 30:28.869
trapped in a gay man's body.

30:28.902 --> 30:29.870
With my cooking,

30:29.903 --> 30:31.939
I always try to draw inspiration

30:31.972 --> 30:34.842
from dishes that I've had
when I was young.

30:34.875 --> 30:36.777
About six years ago,

30:36.810 --> 30:38.579
my mother
was deported to Mexico.

30:38.612 --> 30:40.080
It was tough.

30:40.113 --> 30:41.749
Everything around me
was just a mess.

30:41.782 --> 30:43.684
So, when I'm cooking,

30:43.717 --> 30:45.285
that's my happy place

30:45.318 --> 30:47.354
because it always
reminds me of her.

30:47.387 --> 30:49.457
This makes my heart warm.

30:49.490 --> 30:52.960
I think that if my mom
could see me right now,

30:52.993 --> 30:54.762
she would be so proud of me.

30:54.795 --> 30:56.363
Love you.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.765
I'm so proud of you.

30:57.798 --> 30:59.299
Oh, my God.

30:59.332 --> 31:01.201
This is the dream, boy.

31:01.234 --> 31:03.136
My name is Nik,
I'm 29 years old

31:03.170 --> 31:04.438
and I'm from
the Cayman Islands

31:04.472 --> 31:05.873
and I'm a model.

31:05.906 --> 31:07.374
I think a lot of people
are shocked

31:07.407 --> 31:09.142
They're like,
"You're a model?

31:09.176 --> 31:11.612
I didn't even know you eat,
much less cook."

31:11.645 --> 31:14.214
And I'm like, "Dude, I'm from
the islands, what do you mean?

31:14.247 --> 31:15.483
We have to cook.

31:15.516 --> 31:17.785
It's, like, mandatory."
( laughs )

31:17.818 --> 31:20.788
This is the kitchen.
This is where the magic happens.

31:20.821 --> 31:23.423
I live, eat, breathe,
Caribbean food.

31:23.457 --> 31:24.625
I represent the Caribbean.

31:24.658 --> 31:26.226
We're very chill,

31:26.259 --> 31:27.227
but I'ma bring the heat.

31:27.260 --> 31:28.328
( laughs )

31:28.361 --> 31:29.897
I'm gonna walk out of there

31:29.930 --> 31:31.098
and I'm gonna have
that apron on,

31:31.131 --> 31:32.299
and I'm gonna
represent Texas.

31:32.332 --> 31:33.967
I'm Chera, I'm 48,

31:34.001 --> 31:36.570
and I was born and raised
in Austin, Texas.

31:36.604 --> 31:38.639
My cooking revolves
around Texas

31:38.672 --> 31:40.608
and what I learned growing up
with my family

31:40.641 --> 31:42.075
'cause they all love to cook.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.777
Don't mess with me
in the kitchen

31:43.811 --> 31:46.246
because I've won
a lot of recipe contests.

31:46.279 --> 31:47.280
This home chef

31:47.314 --> 31:48.982
knows what it takes to win.

31:49.016 --> 31:50.984
Muy caliente!

31:51.018 --> 31:52.119
My name is Ashley,

31:52.152 --> 31:53.487
I'm 28 years old,

31:53.521 --> 31:55.022
I'm from Opa-Locka, Florida.

31:55.055 --> 31:57.257
( cheering )

31:57.290 --> 31:59.960
I decided to leave
my teaching career behind

31:59.993 --> 32:01.595
a few months ago

32:01.629 --> 32:04.498
in order to pursue
my dreams of cooking.

32:04.532 --> 32:07.000
My own mother
has looked at me crazy

32:07.034 --> 32:10.037
for leaving my job
and career behind.

32:13.541 --> 32:14.642
Gordon:
Welcome.

32:14.675 --> 32:16.043
Come on down.

32:16.076 --> 32:17.678
- Oh, my God.
- Whoo!

32:17.711 --> 32:19.179
But there is nothing

32:19.212 --> 32:20.814
that's gonna hold me back

32:20.848 --> 32:24.151
from being the next MasterChef.

32:24.184 --> 32:26.654
Welcome to the MasterChef
kitchen, all of you.

32:26.687 --> 32:30.824
Tonight, all of
your signature dishes are hot,

32:30.858 --> 32:32.392
spicy,

32:32.425 --> 32:33.727
and hopefully good enough
to win an apron.

32:33.761 --> 32:34.995
Yes.

32:35.028 --> 32:36.463
Gordon: Two aprons
are still available.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.866
Joe's already given out
all of his aprons,

32:38.899 --> 32:43.236
but Aar贸n and myself
each have one left,

32:43.270 --> 32:47.808
which means we have to be very,
very meticulous in our choices.

32:47.841 --> 32:50.443
All right,
so your 45 minutes starts...

32:52.445 --> 32:53.714
...now.

32:59.953 --> 33:02.422
I got those jalape帽os open.
They're smelling spicy.

33:02.455 --> 33:03.591
- Chera?
- Yes, sir.

33:03.624 --> 33:04.692
Please tell me,
what's the dish?

33:04.725 --> 33:05.993
So, the herb-encrusted lamb

33:06.026 --> 33:07.394
is gonna have
all fresh herbs,

33:07.427 --> 33:09.597
a little bit of oregano,
rosemary, and some sage.

33:09.630 --> 33:11.364
Then I'm gonna do
a roasted jalape帽o

33:11.398 --> 33:12.900
with some roasted corn.

33:12.933 --> 33:15.068
And then I'm gonna flamb茅
a little of that tequila

33:15.102 --> 33:17.571
to make the saucy tequila
onion jam.

33:17.605 --> 33:19.406
So we're gonna
bring the heat today.

33:19.439 --> 33:21.108
There we go.

33:21.141 --> 33:22.375
Hot. Ah!

33:22.409 --> 33:24.177
Just kidding.
( chuckles )

33:24.211 --> 33:25.412
Juni, talk to me about
what you're making.

33:25.445 --> 33:27.347
I'm making the chile relleno.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.283
I have been a vegetarian
for over ten years,

33:30.317 --> 33:32.219
so what I'll be stuffing it
with today

33:32.252 --> 33:35.255
is gonna be potatoes,
saut茅ed onions, garlic,

33:35.288 --> 33:38.726
broccoli, Manchego,
and various spices.

33:38.759 --> 33:40.594
We've had some
extraordinary vegetarians

33:40.628 --> 33:42.229
participate in
this competition
over the years.

33:42.262 --> 33:44.397
Doesn't mean that I don't know
how to handle some meat

33:44.431 --> 33:46.867
'cause I've handled
a lot of meat in my days.

33:46.900 --> 33:49.102
- ( squeals )
- ( laughs )

33:49.136 --> 33:51.438
Guys, just under
20 minutes to go, come on.

33:51.471 --> 33:53.240
You got this.

33:53.273 --> 33:54.975
Nik, give us an insight
into what you're making.

33:55.008 --> 33:57.210
I'm making
a Cayman-style lobster

33:57.244 --> 33:59.079
with turmeric and dill rice.

33:59.112 --> 34:01.081
How you gonna
incorporate the spice?

34:01.114 --> 34:03.216
I fried
the Scotch bonnets whole

34:03.250 --> 34:05.118
and that's where the heat
is gonna come from.

34:05.152 --> 34:07.154
Got ya. One of the most
powerful chilis on the planet.

34:07.187 --> 34:08.922
Oh, but it's the most flavorful

34:08.956 --> 34:10.991
and the heat
is gonna give me that apron.

34:11.024 --> 34:12.325
Great.

34:12.359 --> 34:14.261
- Bring it out, y'all.
- Whoo-hoo!

34:14.294 --> 34:15.763
- So, Ashley?
- Yes.

34:15.796 --> 34:16.997
Tell me about the dish.

34:17.030 --> 34:19.332
It's a decadent
chocolate spiced brownie

34:19.366 --> 34:22.235
with candied pecans,
a spiced whipped cream

34:22.269 --> 34:24.071
and a chocolate ganache.

34:24.104 --> 34:25.505
Do you know the kind of
risk you're taking

34:25.538 --> 34:26.940
coming in here
and baking a dessert?

34:26.974 --> 34:29.176
I am willing
to take the risk.

34:29.209 --> 34:31.344
I've given up
my career as a teacher

34:31.378 --> 34:34.848
to throw myself
into the culinary industry.

34:34.882 --> 34:38.251
So, I've had to be risky in life
to get in front of you today.

34:38.285 --> 34:39.252
Gordon:
Right.

34:39.286 --> 34:40.587
Just under 15 minutes to go.

34:40.620 --> 34:41.588
Plenty of time.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.023
Let's do it.

34:43.056 --> 34:45.592
Guys, you've got
one apron each.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.327
What are you guys thinking?
What's the strategy?

34:47.360 --> 34:49.930
My strategy is I'm looking
for the best student,

34:49.963 --> 34:53.166
the student that can become
America's next MasterChef.

34:53.200 --> 34:54.802
That's the heat, you guys.
Check it out.

34:54.835 --> 34:56.670
Yes.

34:56.704 --> 34:58.171
My picks
are all about heart.

34:58.205 --> 34:59.873
There's no need
to change that right now.

34:59.907 --> 35:02.375
Oh, the heat is in there.

35:02.409 --> 35:03.844
Gordon:
Under five minutes to go.

35:03.877 --> 35:05.045
This is it, come on.

35:05.078 --> 35:06.446
You got this, you guys.

35:06.479 --> 35:07.715
Bring the heat.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.484
Ashley's brownies
are out the oven.

35:11.518 --> 35:12.953
Oh, come on, baby.

35:12.986 --> 35:15.288
Come on, come on, pepper.

35:15.322 --> 35:16.456
Juni, what are you
doing right now?

35:16.489 --> 35:18.225
I am frying this pepper.

35:18.258 --> 35:19.727
You know you have
two minutes.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.361
- Gotta get it on the plate.
- Ugh.

35:21.394 --> 35:22.996
Go, pepper, go.

35:23.030 --> 35:24.664
What's Ashley doing?
It's still hot

35:24.698 --> 35:26.399
and she just poured
ganache on it?

35:26.433 --> 35:28.201
- It looks like
it's falling apart.
- Gotta let it set first.

35:28.235 --> 35:30.470
That apron is slipping
through her fingers right now.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.339
60 seconds remaining,
come on.

35:32.372 --> 35:34.474
- You got this, let's go.
- Move, y'all, move, move, move.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.243
I'm trying, I'm trying.

35:36.276 --> 35:37.377
- All right.
- Ten...

35:37.410 --> 35:39.012
Judges:
Nine, eight,

35:39.046 --> 35:42.750
seven, six, five, four,

35:42.783 --> 35:44.985
three, two, one.

35:45.018 --> 35:46.586
- Gordon: And stop.
- Joe: Hands up in the air.

35:46.619 --> 35:47.888
- Gordon: Well done.
- Whoo!

35:47.921 --> 35:49.189
Good job, guys.

35:49.222 --> 35:50.590
Oh, my God.

35:56.096 --> 35:58.265
Aar贸n: Four very passionate
home cooks.

35:58.298 --> 36:01.034
All your dishes tonight
brought the heat.

36:01.068 --> 36:03.336
Now it's time to find out
if they're good enough
for an apron.

36:03.370 --> 36:06.874
Gordon: Unfortunately, guys,
Joe's already given out
all of his aprons,

36:06.907 --> 36:10.177
but Aar贸n and myself
each have one left.

36:10.210 --> 36:12.112
So this is gonna be tough.

36:15.048 --> 36:16.616
Chera, describe the dish.

36:16.649 --> 36:18.518
It's an herb-encrusted
lamb chop,

36:18.551 --> 36:21.121
and then I did a roasted
corn and jalape帽o salsa,

36:21.154 --> 36:23.690
and then a saucy
tequila onion jam.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.292
Wish you would've seared
that a little bit better.

36:25.325 --> 36:28.361
So I'm having trouble even
getting through all that fat.

36:28.395 --> 36:29.930
That flavor's gonna be there,
I promise.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.368
I think the most redeeming
part of this dish

36:35.402 --> 36:38.071
is the corn or the hash that
you have on the bottom of it.

36:38.105 --> 36:40.974
I like the fact that
you took time to
develop flavor on the grill,

36:41.008 --> 36:43.376
but I think the lamb
is really underdone.

36:43.410 --> 36:44.611
I know I can do better.

36:46.346 --> 36:48.782
Tell me about the corn.
What'd you do?

36:48.816 --> 36:51.051
I roasted it and it wasn't
really getting that sear,

36:51.084 --> 36:54.721
so I put it directly in the fire
to get that pop and sizzle
on the outside.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.089
Heat is there.

36:56.123 --> 36:57.791
I love the caramelization
on the outside.

36:57.825 --> 37:00.127
However, unfortunately,
it's undercooked.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.328
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.299
Juni, describe
the dish, please.

37:06.333 --> 37:11.138
So, you have a chile relleno
stuffed with potatoes, broccoli,

37:11.171 --> 37:14.674
and served over
a chipotle tomato sauce.

37:14.707 --> 37:16.810
I garnished it
with red cabbage

37:16.844 --> 37:18.478
and a drizzle of crema.

37:18.511 --> 37:20.180
There's way too much sauce.

37:20.213 --> 37:21.982
It's taking away any of
the texture from the chile

37:22.015 --> 37:23.350
and the crunchy bits
on the outside,

37:23.383 --> 37:24.852
but let me tell you,

37:24.885 --> 37:27.787
the flavor of that
chile relleno is magical.

37:27.821 --> 37:30.357
Really reminds me of, like,
a Texas Mexican household,

37:30.390 --> 37:31.458
which I love.

37:31.491 --> 37:32.960
- Good job.
- Thank you.

37:37.697 --> 37:39.933
The chile relleno
is done beautifully.

37:39.967 --> 37:42.369
Heat is there,
sauce is delicious.

37:42.402 --> 37:44.972
However, the presentation,
just show a bit of finesse.

37:45.005 --> 37:48.041
- Yes.
- It's like putting on
your clothes, dress up smart.

37:48.075 --> 37:49.943
Do the same to the plate
and you elevate the dish.

37:49.977 --> 37:51.044
- Understandable.
- Thank you.

37:51.078 --> 37:52.846
Thank you, Chef.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.381
Nik, describe the dish,
please.

37:54.414 --> 37:58.185
So, it's Cayman-style lobster
with turmeric and dill rice,

37:58.218 --> 38:00.353
bell peppers and some
Scotch bonnet in there.

38:00.387 --> 38:02.155
- And then you added
bacon as well.
- Exactly.

38:05.192 --> 38:07.160
You're aggressive
with chili and I like that.

38:07.194 --> 38:09.863
Lobster is sweet.
The rice is cooked perfectly.

38:09.897 --> 38:11.965
I just don't see
the bacon working here.

38:11.999 --> 38:13.733
Okay, that's good to know.

38:13.766 --> 38:14.834
Thank you.

38:18.939 --> 38:21.741
So, lobster's nice.
It's cooked beautifully.

38:21.774 --> 38:23.510
However, the dish
needs a broth.

38:23.543 --> 38:25.412
It needs something to
counteract that heat.

38:25.445 --> 38:28.081
I mean, we don't normally
make it with a broth.

38:28.115 --> 38:30.317
- Right.
- But I can totally
make a broth.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.352
Unfortunately,
this is a competition

38:32.385 --> 38:34.687
and I have to judge you
on what you put on a plate.

38:34.721 --> 38:35.688
Yeah.

38:35.722 --> 38:36.723
Thank you.

38:38.391 --> 38:39.726
So, describe the dish,
please.

38:39.759 --> 38:43.997
I have my Maya chocolate
spiced brownie

38:44.031 --> 38:48.435
with candied pecans and
a decadent chocolate ganache.

38:48.468 --> 38:50.003
On the pecans,
what'd you do?

38:50.037 --> 38:53.773
I toasted them and then
I candied them in melted sugar

38:53.806 --> 38:55.909
and some salt.

38:55.943 --> 38:57.677
The brownie's delicious,

38:57.710 --> 38:59.012
- let's get that right.
- Thank you, Chef.

38:59.046 --> 39:01.048
You just wanna
dive in there.

39:01.081 --> 39:03.216
But it needs
something tart.

39:03.250 --> 39:06.053
Spoonful of cr猫me fra卯che
to counteract that richness.

39:06.086 --> 39:08.755
- Yes, Chef.
- Delicious.

39:08.788 --> 39:10.590
Miss Ashley, what kind
of chili did you use?

39:10.623 --> 39:14.461
I used cayenne
and I used chili powder.

39:14.494 --> 39:16.529
You did a great job
of balancing the heat

39:16.563 --> 39:19.099
'cause I'm getting it
in the back palate,
which is wonderful,

39:19.132 --> 39:21.935
but I think it's
a little sloppy.
I think you rushed it.

39:21.969 --> 39:24.371
I think you have to let all
those wonderful ingredients set.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.739
- Yes, Chef.
- And then you'll get
a better product at the end.

39:26.773 --> 39:27.840
- Yes, Chef.
- Thank you.

39:32.779 --> 39:34.147
Four home cooks

39:34.181 --> 39:35.748
who all brought the heat,

39:35.782 --> 39:38.785
some more successfully
than others.

39:38.818 --> 39:40.887
Gordon:
Now, listen very carefully.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.956
Two aprons are still available.

39:42.990 --> 39:45.925
Joe's already given out
all of his eight aprons,

39:45.959 --> 39:48.828
but Aar贸n and I
each have one left.

39:51.198 --> 39:54.367
Aar贸n: And I'm not gonna
give this away lightly.

39:56.136 --> 39:58.638
I've connected
with somebody here,

39:58.671 --> 40:02.742
and I'm gonna take this home
cook all the way to the finale.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.777
Gordon, you have a stake
in the game, you in?

40:04.811 --> 40:08.848
Yeah, I'm gonna make this
even more interesting.

40:08.881 --> 40:10.317
Oh, my God.

40:17.390 --> 40:21.861
Gordon:
You've just started
the beginning of your dream.

40:21.894 --> 40:24.464
Holy ( bleep ).

40:24.497 --> 40:27.000
( cheering )

40:39.212 --> 40:40.813
I got an apron
from Aar贸n Sanchez!

40:40.847 --> 40:42.682
I'm so happy!

40:42.715 --> 40:44.951
I know that my mom's not here
to see me right now,

40:44.984 --> 40:46.553
but I know
I'm gonna make her proud.

40:46.586 --> 40:49.322
Whoo!

40:49.356 --> 40:52.625
It means the world
to have my family here.

40:52.659 --> 40:55.628
Everyone one in Opa-Locka
needs to turn the volume up,

40:55.662 --> 40:57.497
and I'm not gonna
let you down, Gordon.

40:57.530 --> 41:00.833
No room... for the hesitation!

41:02.035 --> 41:04.871
Wow, what an
incredible brownie.

41:04.904 --> 41:06.473
Watch your back.

41:06.506 --> 41:08.708
- No, I don't think so.
- No, no, no, trust me.

41:08.741 --> 41:10.077
Good luck 'cause
you're gonna need it.

41:10.110 --> 41:11.244
Aar贸n:
I might be a little loco,

41:11.278 --> 41:12.679
but I know talent.

41:12.712 --> 41:15.382
Juni is the one that
I believe in the most.

41:15.415 --> 41:16.483
Ashley was the one.

41:16.516 --> 41:17.484
Hold on,
there's someone missing.

41:17.517 --> 41:18.851

41:26.893 --> 41:28.395
Fighting over the scraps.

41:28.428 --> 41:29.396

Each one of you
were given an apron

41:55.555 --> 41:56.523
