IN THE BIBLE...

I PRAYED BY
MY BABY'S GRAVE.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.262
I ASKED HIM TO MAKE
HER ALIVE AGAIN.

09:54.428 --> 09:58.307

THINGS THAN THAT.

SO AFRAID OF THE DARK.

ABOUT ME,

GO ON IN THE HOUSE?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.836

11:51.003 --> 11:55.132
WHEN PEOPLE ARE MOURNING,
THEY SAY A LOT OF THINGS
THEY DON'T MEAN.

11:55.299 --> 11:56.842
I KNOW.

11:59.804 --> 12:01.347
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

12:02.598 --> 12:05.726
BUT IT WAS MY IDEA
TO GO SWIMMING.

TO ME.

12:10.815 --> 12:13.818

FORETELL THE FUTURE.

12:15.194 --> 12:17.446
SOMETIMES THINGS
JUST HAPPEN, THAT'S ALL.

12:19.323 --> 12:21.158
THERE'S NOTHING
ANYBODY CAN DO
ABOUT IT.

12:21.325 --> 12:23.452
THERE'S NOBODY
TO BLAME FOR IT.

LEAN ON THE LORD,
THAT'S ALL.

13:00.239 --> 13:02.241
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN AWAKE?

13:02.408 --> 13:04.326
AWHILE.

13:04.493 --> 13:07.580
LISTEN, WOULD YOU
LIKE FOR ME TO HEAT
YOU SOME SOUP? I--

13:07.746 --> 13:08.706
NO.

13:08.873 --> 13:10.207
NO, BUT
YOU SHOULD TRY--

13:10.374 --> 13:14.253
THAT GIRL'S MOTHER
MADE THE SOUP,
DIDN'T SHE?

13:15.254 --> 13:16.755
MRS. INGALLS
JUST THOUGHT
THAT YOU--

13:16.922 --> 13:18.507
I KNOW WHAT
SHE THOUGHT.

13:18.674 --> 13:21.844
SHE THOUGHT SHE'D
COVER UP HER DAUGHTER'S
GUILT BY BEING NICE.

13:22.011 --> 13:23.554
ELOISE.

13:23.721 --> 13:25.598
AND DO YOU
REMEMBER THIS ONE?

13:25.764 --> 13:27.391
SHE PAINTED THAT

13:27.558 --> 13:29.268
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

13:29.435 --> 13:32.271
SHE LOVED BRIGHT COLORS.

13:32.438 --> 13:33.355
I DON'T KNOW

13:33.522 --> 13:35.649
WHAT'S GROWING ON THESE TREES.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.819
ORANGE AND LAVENDER...

13:41.363 --> 13:42.531
WHY WEREN'T YOU HOME

13:42.698 --> 13:44.325
WHEN SHE CAME FROM SCHOOL?

13:44.492 --> 13:45.993
WHAT?

13:47.411 --> 13:49.121
WHY WEREN'T YOU HOME?

13:50.706 --> 13:52.625
IT WAS STILL EARLY.
I WAS WORKING.

13:52.791 --> 13:56.003
IF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN HOME,
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE.

13:56.170 --> 13:57.713
YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE LET HER.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.715
YES, I WOULD.

13:59.882 --> 14:00.799
OH, NO.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.093
YOU WOULD HAVE SAID,
"CHORES FIRST."

14:03.260 --> 14:04.887
I KNOW YOU WOULD.

14:05.971 --> 14:08.557
YOU SHOULD
HAVE BEEN HERE.

14:08.724 --> 14:12.645
SHE WOULD BE ALIVE NOW
IF YOU WERE.

14:15.481 --> 14:18.400
GET OUT OF
MY BABY'S ROOM!

14:21.028 --> 14:23.155

YEAH. YEAH.

OH, WELL, GOOD.

17:47.443 --> 17:49.611
JONATHAN, I DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

17:49.778 --> 17:51.697
FOR HER TO SEE YOU

18:07.045 --> 18:08.464
AND WE WAS WORKING,

18:08.630 --> 18:09.798
AND CHARLES PUT
THE WATER DOWN,

18:09.965 --> 18:11.049
AND I WAS
SPINNING AROUND.

18:11.216 --> 18:14.052
AND I'M AWFUL DIZZY,
BUT NO, NO, NO, I--

18:14.219 --> 18:16.638
OH, I SEE.

18:16.805 --> 18:20.476
YEAH.
SEE YOU, REVEREND.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.978
JONATHAN?

18:23.145 --> 18:26.857
I HOPE YOU'VE GOT
A BETTER STORY THAN
THAT FOR YOUR WIFE.

18:29.026 --> 18:30.319
HA!

18:31.695 --> 18:33.322
[THUD]

18:33.489 --> 18:36.575
HEY, ELLEN,
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

18:38.660 --> 18:39.995
THAT'LL DO HER.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.163
MUCH OBLIGED,
CHARLES.

18:41.330 --> 18:42.289
YOU TAKE CARE.

18:42.456 --> 18:44.583
SEE YOU.
HYAH!

18:46.460 --> 18:47.628
MORNING, CHARLES.

18:47.795 --> 18:49.213
HEY, MORNING,
REVEREND.

18:49.379 --> 18:52.382
I, UH, WAS OUT
AT THE TAYLOR PLACE
THIS MORNING.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.593
HOW ARE THEY DOING?

18:54.760 --> 18:56.386
NOT WELL AT ALL.

18:56.553 --> 18:59.765
ELOISE DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK TO ME
OR TO CAL.

18:59.932 --> 19:01.225
TO CAL?

19:01.391 --> 19:02.518
AFTER THE FUNERAL
YESTERDAY,

19:02.684 --> 19:04.478
SHE BLAMED
HIM FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

19:04.645 --> 19:07.231
THERE'S NO RATIONAL
REASON, CHARLES.

19:07.397 --> 19:08.315
IT'S JUST--

19:08.482 --> 19:10.776
ELOISE IS
VERY NEAR THE EDGE.

19:10.943 --> 19:13.362
THAT'S WHY
I CAME TO SEE YOU.

19:13.529 --> 19:14.404
I WONDER--

19:14.571 --> 19:15.614
DO YOU THINK
CAROLINE WOULD MIND

19:15.781 --> 19:17.241
GOING OUT
AND TALKING TO HER?

19:17.407 --> 19:19.326
SOMETIMES A WOMAN'S
UNDERSTANDING
CAN DO SO MUCH MORE

19:19.493 --> 19:22.079
THAN A MINISTER
SAYING, "BE STRONG."

19:22.246 --> 19:24.790
I'M SURE CAROLINE
WOULD BE HAPPY
TO GO AND SEE HER.

19:24.957 --> 19:25.999
I'D APPRECIATE IT.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.292
I'LL RIDE HOME
RIGHT NOW AND ASK HER.

19:27.459 --> 19:29.586
THANK YOU, CHARLES.
SEE YOU SUNDAY.

19:29.753 --> 19:30.838
SEE YOU.

19:34.967 --> 19:36.677
CHARLES!

19:36.844 --> 19:37.970
I'LL BE BACK SOON!

19:38.136 --> 19:39.429
I GOT TO GO HOME
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

19:39.596 --> 19:40.639
CHARLES,
IT'S IMPORTANT.

19:40.806 --> 19:42.182
YOU GOT TO GO OVER
AND TELL ALICE

19:42.349 --> 19:43.642
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
DOWN THERE WITH
THAT WHEEL.

19:43.809 --> 19:45.310
SHE THINKS
I'VE BEEN DRINKING.

19:45.477 --> 19:47.104
SHE'S MAD
AS A WET HEN.

19:47.271 --> 19:50.148
LISTEN, YOU'D THINK
I HAD A DISHONEST FACE
OR SOMETHING.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.192
YOU DO!

20:06.039 --> 20:07.499
CAL?

20:07.666 --> 20:09.626
MRS. INGALLS.

20:09.793 --> 20:13.463
THE REVEREND WANTED
ME TO STOP BY.

20:14.923 --> 20:18.468
I'M AFRAID YOU'D BE
WASTING YOUR TIME,
MRS. INGALLS.

20:19.845 --> 20:22.681
SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK ANY SENSE.

20:23.891 --> 20:26.018
SHE TOLD ME
TO GET OUT.

20:26.184 --> 20:28.645
SHE DIDN'T
MEAN THAT.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.272
YEAH.

20:32.149 --> 20:34.067
WELL, I'M GOING.

20:37.029 --> 20:39.865
I'M NOT THAT STRONG,
MRS. INGALLS.

20:40.032 --> 20:41.992
I'M TIRED.

20:45.037 --> 20:48.123
I GOT TO GET OVER
THIS THING, TOO.

21:07.434 --> 21:11.521
I'LL BE OVER
AT MY COUSIN CLAY'S
IF ELOISE NEEDS ME.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.902
GET UP!

21:36.546 --> 21:39.883
Eloise: I TOLD YOU
TO GO AND NOT
COME BACK.

21:40.050 --> 21:41.093
ELOISE?

21:41.259 --> 21:43.762
IT'S CAROLINE.

21:43.929 --> 21:47.224
I THOUGHT WE COULD
TALK FOR A WHILE.

21:53.063 --> 21:54.648
ELOISE?

21:56.024 --> 21:58.735
GO HOME TO
YOUR FAMILY,
TO YOUR CHILDREN.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.946
YOU'RE NOT
WELCOME HERE.

22:09.830 --> 22:11.123
Mary:
COME ON, CARRIE.

22:11.289 --> 22:12.666
YOU CAN'T WALK THAT
SLOW. WE'LL BE LATE.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.334
Laura: CARRIE,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

22:14.501 --> 22:15.669
Carrie: I DON'T
WANT TO GO.

22:15.836 --> 22:16.795
WHY?

22:16.962 --> 22:18.338
I DON'T HAVE
A PRESENT.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.717
WELL, I'LL TELL
MISS BEADLE THIS
IS FROM BOTH OF US.

22:21.883 --> 22:23.176
HEY,
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.553
WHY?

22:24.720 --> 22:26.555
BECAUSE NOW YOU TWO
ARE GIVING HER
A REAL PRESENT,

22:26.722 --> 22:28.140
AND I'M JUST
GIVING HER FLOWERS.

22:28.306 --> 22:29.307
OH, ALL RIGHT.

22:29.474 --> 22:30.767
WE'LL SAY IT'S
FROM ALL 3 OF US.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.477
THAT'S
NOT FAIR.

22:32.644 --> 22:35.063
WHAT'S NOT FAIR
NOW, CARRIE?

22:35.230 --> 22:38.191
THAT MEANS THAT
LAURA'S GIVING HER
TWO PRESENTS.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.443
Mary: SISTERS!

22:39.609 --> 22:40.944
Laura: HEY, I'VE
GOT A GOOD IDEA.

22:41.111 --> 22:42.821
SINCE WE'RE GIVING
ONE PRESENT
TO MISS BEADLE,

22:42.988 --> 22:44.031
I'LL GIVE THESE
TO MRS. TAYLOR.

22:44.197 --> 22:45.407
SHE LOVES FLOWERS.

22:45.574 --> 22:46.950
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO
SEE ANYBODY JUST YET.

22:47.117 --> 22:48.493
IF SHE DOESN'T,
I'LL LEAVE THEM
AT THE DOOR.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.328
I'LL CUT
ACROSS BUSBY'S
AND CATCH UP.

22:50.495 --> 22:51.830
PA DOESN'T WANT YOU
GOING NEAR BUSBY'S.

22:51.997 --> 22:52.831
IT'S QUICKER.

22:52.998 --> 22:54.791
BESIDES,
HE DON'T SCARE ME.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.501
IF YOU SEE HIM,
YOU RUN.

22:56.668 --> 22:58.170
I WILL!

23:11.349 --> 23:13.310
MRS. TAYLOR?

23:26.990 --> 23:29.034
MRS. TAYLOR?

23:35.040 --> 23:37.167
MRS. TAYLOR?

23:37.334 --> 23:39.878
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

23:41.880 --> 23:44.174
I BROUGHT YOU
SOME FLOWERS.

24:11.952 --> 24:16.039
MY ELLEN ALWAYS
BROUGHT ME FLOWERS.

24:24.256 --> 24:25.715
OH!

24:39.104 --> 24:41.690
I'LL PUT THEM
IN SOME WATER.

24:51.324 --> 24:53.952
SILLY OF ME,
WASN'T IT?

24:54.119 --> 24:55.787
ALWAYS SO USED
TO GETTING UP

24:55.954 --> 24:58.248
AND FIXING
ELLEN'S LUNCH, I...

24:58.415 --> 25:00.000
WHY DID IT HAPPEN?

25:00.167 --> 25:02.252
WHY?

25:02.419 --> 25:04.462
SHE WAS SUCH
A GOOD GIRL.

25:04.629 --> 25:06.840
SHE WAS SUCH A...

25:32.699 --> 25:34.284
I BETTER
GO TO SCHOOL.

25:34.451 --> 25:36.411
LAURA.

25:36.578 --> 25:41.249
UH, I WONDER IF YOU
COULD DO ME A FAVOR
BEFORE YOU GO.

25:41.416 --> 25:42.667
SURE.

25:42.834 --> 25:43.960
WELL, I--

25:44.127 --> 25:45.879
I HAVEN'T BEEN
EATING PROPER,

25:46.046 --> 25:47.964
BUT WITH YOUR VISIT
AND THE FLOWERS,

25:48.131 --> 25:49.716
I KIND OF GOT
MY APPETITE BACK.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.676
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO FIX YOU SOMETHING.

25:51.843 --> 25:54.346
NO, I WOULDN'T
WANT YOU TO BE LATE
FOR SCHOOL.

25:54.512 --> 25:56.681
I, UH, I'M FEELING
KIND OF WEAK,

25:56.848 --> 25:58.391
AND I JUST
WONDERED IF YOU'D
FETCH SOME APPLES

25:58.558 --> 26:00.185
OUT OF
THE ROOT CELLAR.

26:00.352 --> 26:02.437
OH. YES, MA'AM.

26:02.604 --> 26:03.730
THANK YOU.

26:06.691 --> 26:08.568
BE CAREFUL.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.278
THE LADDER'S STEEP.

26:10.445 --> 26:11.571
I'LL BE CAREFUL.

26:14.783 --> 26:16.701
THE APPLES ARE
IN THE CORNER
BEHIND YOU.

26:16.868 --> 26:18.370
THANKS. I SEE THEM.

26:21.373 --> 26:22.666
MRS. TAYLOR!

26:46.898 --> 26:48.608
PA!

26:48.775 --> 26:50.735
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT OF SCHOOL,
YOUNG LADY?

26:50.902 --> 26:52.028
MISS BEADLE LET ME.

26:52.195 --> 26:53.989
PA, LAURA DIDN'T
COME TO SCHOOL TODAY.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.365
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

26:55.532 --> 26:57.200
SHE WANTED TO
BRING FLOWERS OVER
TO MRS. TAYLOR.

26:57.367 --> 27:00.287
SHE SAID SHE'D CATCH UP,
BUT THAT WAS ALMOST
TWO HOURS AGO.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.163
SHE SAID SHE'D CUT
ACROSS BUSBY'S PLACE.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.124
SHE KNOWS BETTER
THAN THAT.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.750
I TOLD HER
NOT TO.

27:05.917 --> 27:08.086
WELL, MAYBE SHE'S JUST
OUT THERE VISITING
WITH MRS. TAYLOR.

27:08.253 --> 27:09.337
YOU'RE
PROBABLY RIGHT.

27:09.504 --> 27:10.880
YOU GO ON
TO SCHOOL.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.799
I'LL GO ON OVER
TO MRS. TAYLOR'S
AND CHECK.

27:12.966 --> 27:14.175
YES, SIR.

27:14.342 --> 27:17.053
LOOK, UH, I'LL GIVE YOU
A RIDE OUT IN THE WAGON.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.346
THANKS.

27:28.315 --> 27:29.607
Charles:
MRS. TAYLOR?

27:29.774 --> 27:31.026
MR. INGALLS.

27:31.192 --> 27:32.360
MARY SAID LAURA
WAS COMING OUT
HERE FOR A VISIT.

27:32.527 --> 27:33.320
IS SHE STILL HERE?

27:33.486 --> 27:35.238
SHE HASN'T BEEN BY.

27:35.405 --> 27:37.198
LEASTWISE,
THAT I KNOW OF.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.326
I'VE--I'VE BEEN
SLEEPING MOST
OF THE MORNING.

27:39.492 --> 27:42.871
SHE MIGHT HAVE
KNOCKED, BUT I--
I DIDN'T HEAR.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.123
WELL,
THANK YOU, MA'AM.

27:45.290 --> 27:46.916
LET'S GET ON
OVER TO BUSBY'S.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.335
GET UP!

28:17.072 --> 28:19.115
[WAGON APPROACHING]

28:37.675 --> 28:39.386
BUSBY!

28:40.303 --> 28:41.888
BUSBY!

28:42.055 --> 28:43.515
I'M GOING TO CHECK
DOWN BY THE CREEK.

28:43.681 --> 28:45.016
ALL RIGHT. I'LL LOOK
AROUND HERE.

28:45.183 --> 28:46.518
HEY, TAKE IT EASY,
NOW.

28:46.684 --> 28:49.145
LAURA'S PROBABLY
BACK IN SCHOOL
NOW ALREADY.

28:53.066 --> 28:54.234
CHARLES!

29:00.073 --> 29:01.741
WHAT IS IT?

29:04.536 --> 29:06.955
I JUST FOUND 'EM
LYING THERE.

29:09.165 --> 29:10.041
THEY'RE LAURA'S.

29:10.208 --> 29:12.293
OH, MY GOD.

29:13.169 --> 29:14.421
I'LL LOOK AROUND HERE.

29:14.587 --> 29:15.964
YOU GO INTO TOWN,
ROUND UP SOME MEN.

29:16.131 --> 29:17.590
ALL RIGHT.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.443
PUT THIS ON.

29:37.694 --> 29:39.571
PLEASE
LET ME GO.

29:39.737 --> 29:41.448
PUT IT ON!

29:51.040 --> 29:53.960
OH, IT'S SO COOL
DOWN HERE.

29:54.127 --> 29:57.380
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
ON SUCH A HOT DAY.

29:57.547 --> 30:01.551
I USED TO LOVE
THE ROOT CELLAR
WHEN I WAS A CHILD.

30:01.718 --> 30:07.182
I'D COME DOWN THE STAIRS
WITH MY PILLOW AND SLEEP
ON THE FLOOR.

30:07.348 --> 30:10.935
IT WAS ALWAYS
SO QUIET...

30:11.102 --> 30:13.062
AND PEACEFUL.

30:14.522 --> 30:17.192
AND I'D DREAM...

30:17.358 --> 30:19.652
WONDERFUL DREAMS.

30:24.449 --> 30:26.659
COME INTO THE LIGHT.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.786
COME.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.852
OH, ELLEN!

31:35.019 --> 31:37.814
MY BEAUTIFUL ELLEN!

31:37.981 --> 31:39.357
MRS. TAYLOR, I--

31:39.524 --> 31:41.526
NO! NO.

31:45.572 --> 31:49.576
SAY..."I LOVE YOU, MAMA."

31:56.874 --> 32:02.005
SAY...
"I LOVE YOU, MAMA."

32:08.052 --> 32:09.929
I--I LOVE YOU, MAMA.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.180
OH!

32:12.974 --> 32:15.602
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

32:15.768 --> 32:20.023
PROMISE--PROMISE
YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE ME.

32:24.068 --> 32:26.571
I--I PROMISE.

32:29.824 --> 32:31.242
YES.

32:31.409 --> 32:32.702
YES.

32:32.869 --> 32:34.037
OH, BABY.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.751
OH, YES!

32:39.917 --> 32:40.793
ELLEN.

32:40.960 --> 32:41.919
ELLEN.

32:42.086 --> 32:43.755
OH, ELLEN!
ELLEN.

32:43.921 --> 32:46.466
YES, ELLEN.
YES, ELLEN.

32:46.633 --> 32:47.967
ELLEN, MY BABY.

32:48.134 --> 32:50.678
ELLEN, MY BABY.

33:01.606 --> 33:03.107
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S MOVE.

33:03.274 --> 33:05.401
I JUST HEARD.
I'D LIKE TO
COME WITH YOU.

33:05.568 --> 33:07.528
WE CAN USE YOU,
BUT YOU AIN'T GOING
TO NEED THAT.

33:07.695 --> 33:09.489
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

33:09.656 --> 33:11.783
ALL I KNOW IS,
MY DAUGHTER DROWNED.

33:11.949 --> 33:13.660
GOOD SWIMMER,
BUT SHE DROWNED.

33:13.826 --> 33:15.411
AND NOW THIS
WITH LAURA.

33:15.578 --> 33:16.829
YOU DON'T
THINK THAT--

33:16.996 --> 33:20.124
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M GOING
TO FIND OUT.

33:36.099 --> 33:37.684
Charles:
FIND ANYTHING, CARL?

33:37.850 --> 33:40.353
Carl: NOT A THING.

33:41.938 --> 33:44.774
WE AIN'T EVEN FOUND
SO MUCH AS A TRAIL.

33:46.401 --> 33:47.485
IT'S GOING
TO BE DARK SOON.

33:47.652 --> 33:49.195
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
SOME LANTERNS.

33:49.362 --> 33:50.988
CHARLES, WE AIN'T
GOING TO FIND
NOTHING IN THE DARK.

33:51.155 --> 33:53.324
WE'LL START SEARCHING
AGAIN AT FIRST LIGHT
IN THE MORNING.

33:53.491 --> 33:55.827
NOW, YOU BETTER
GO ON HOME.

33:55.993 --> 33:58.079
CAROLINE WILL BE
NEEDING YOU.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.168
YEAH.

34:06.337 --> 34:08.381
CAL,
TAKE HIM ON MY WAGON.

34:08.548 --> 34:11.342
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE
IN CASE BUSBY COMES BACK.

34:11.509 --> 34:12.677
LET ME STAY.

34:12.844 --> 34:14.345
NO, NOT THE WAY
YOU'RE FEELING.

34:14.512 --> 34:15.972
NOW GO ON.
