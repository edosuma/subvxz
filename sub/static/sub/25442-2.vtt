♪♪

00:07.960 --> 00:09.620
-Uh, Ma?
-Uh...

00:09.620 --> 00:12.960
Your face is moving,
but nothing's coming out.

00:14.460 --> 00:17.460
That's the same face
she makes when you show her
your report card.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.750
Rae, why is this
so hard for you?

00:22.750 --> 00:25.750
'Cause, Chels, I haven't
said those words since
we were their age.

00:25.750 --> 00:26.620
What words?

00:29.000 --> 00:30.420
Raven:
Um...

00:32.330 --> 00:33.540
Oh... okay.

00:33.540 --> 00:35.040
Um, I'm psychic.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.710
Both: What?

00:36.710 --> 00:37.750
I'm psychic.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.750
-I'm psychic.
That feels good!
-Chelsea: Yeah.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.790
That feels really good,
I'm psychic.

00:42.790 --> 00:43.960
(laughs)

00:43.960 --> 00:45.620
Ah! I'm psychic!

00:45.620 --> 00:48.420
Man: Yeah? Can you see
I don't care, lady?

00:50.380 --> 00:52.790
I have been hiding this
for so long and...

00:53.460 --> 00:55.960
I finally get to share it
with my baby boy!

00:55.960 --> 00:58.330
(gasps) Unless
you're psychic too, Nia.

00:59.540 --> 01:00.830
No, I'm just regular.

01:00.830 --> 01:01.750
-Oh.
-Yeah.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.420
Well, then maybe
you'll get it one day.

01:03.420 --> 01:04.920
Or not. It's not a big deal.

01:04.920 --> 01:06.580
(gasps)

01:06.580 --> 01:08.460
My baby boy is psychic
like his mama!

01:08.460 --> 01:10.620
This is the best day ever!

01:10.620 --> 01:12.540
Even with your money
stuck in here?

01:12.540 --> 01:15.670
Yeah, Rae, your money
is not coming out of this thing.

01:15.670 --> 01:17.920
Yeah, that whole arm's
gotta come off.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.460
What?
The whole thing?

01:20.460 --> 01:23.000
Two psychics
and neither of you
saw this coming?

01:25.580 --> 01:26.580
Calm down, sweetheart.

01:26.580 --> 01:27.880
Your arm doesn't
have to come off.

01:27.880 --> 01:28.960
My money's not in there.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.040
What?

01:30.040 --> 01:31.880
But what about my vision?

01:31.880 --> 01:33.500
Oh, your vision
doesn't stand a chance

01:33.500 --> 01:35.290
against my Mom-tuition.

01:35.290 --> 01:36.620
I knew y'all were
up to something.

01:37.580 --> 01:38.830
So, before I went to work

01:38.830 --> 01:40.290
I took the money out of Pinky

01:40.290 --> 01:42.580
and put it some place
that you guys would
never suspect.

01:42.580 --> 01:43.620
Chelsea's garden.

01:43.620 --> 01:44.670
Hold up.

01:44.670 --> 01:46.620
If the money wasn't in Pinky,

01:46.620 --> 01:47.790
then what was?

01:47.790 --> 01:50.540
Uh, my wallet, some coupons,
my emergency ponytail.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.960
What? Rae, I thought
you hate dirt.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.000
I do hate dirt.

01:54.790 --> 01:56.420
But I love my money.

Don't worry!

We're gonna get you
out of this cement

03:07.500 --> 03:09.540
as delicately as possible.

03:09.540 --> 03:10.420
(gasps) Spider!

03:10.420 --> 03:11.120
(all scream)

03:11.120 --> 03:12.750
(thud, crash)

03:12.750 --> 03:14.830
I am not your play thing!

03:14.830 --> 03:16.500
But we did kill the spider.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.000
-Yeah.
-No. No, we didn't!

03:18.000 --> 03:19.080
(all scream)

03:20.080 --> 03:21.830
Oh. What?

03:21.830 --> 03:23.750
Levi, you got him.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.880
Levi didn't.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.540
That spider was crushed by...

03:28.540 --> 03:30.580
Cemento!

03:31.880 --> 03:32.750
Who?

03:32.750 --> 03:34.830
It's my super hero name.

03:34.830 --> 03:36.750
With this cement fist,

03:36.750 --> 03:39.880
I'll never be the end
of the human chain again.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.790
Cemento!

03:41.790 --> 03:43.420
More like "Demento."

03:44.880 --> 03:46.420
I'm still worried that that bird

03:46.420 --> 03:47.830
flew off with Mom's money.

03:47.830 --> 03:48.920
Oh, you guys,

03:48.920 --> 03:50.750
don't worry about your mom.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.880
Listen, if there's one thing
I know about Raven Baxter

03:53.880 --> 03:55.710
it's that she's a strong woman.

03:56.710 --> 03:58.000
Bird! (shrieks)

03:58.000 --> 03:59.830
My money swooped.

03:59.830 --> 04:01.170
Bye-bye.

04:01.170 --> 04:02.880
Okay, I think
I'm wrong about this.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.000
-Nia: Mom--
-Falcon.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.080
-Booker: Calm down.
-Swooped.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.000
-We'll find... the money.
-Snatched... my money.

04:07.000 --> 04:07.960
Chels!

04:07.960 --> 04:10.080
Did you-- Did you call
the owner of the bird?

04:10.080 --> 04:12.880
Yes, Norman says
he has no idea where Ernesto is.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.210
Oh.

04:14.210 --> 04:16.500
He also says he hopes
the meatloaf repeats on you?

04:17.920 --> 04:19.040
I'm never gonna find that money.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.580
Mom, don't worry.

04:20.580 --> 04:22.380
We'll find Ernesto.

04:22.380 --> 04:25.080
I can make a vision board
with different solutions
on how to solve this.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.460
-Okay.
-Nia...

04:26.460 --> 04:29.000
I'm not sure
a vision board
is gonna help.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.170
I mean, we need real visions.

04:31.170 --> 04:32.920
So it's time for...

04:32.920 --> 04:35.460
the Psychic Duo!

04:35.460 --> 04:37.120
Not to be confused with...

04:37.120 --> 04:39.170
Cemento!

04:39.170 --> 04:41.080
Nobody is confusing those two.

04:42.040 --> 04:45.920
If the Psychic Duo
combines the power
of our visions,

04:45.920 --> 04:47.920
I bet we can
find Ernesto in no time.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.000
A double vision?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.710
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

04:50.710 --> 04:52.830
Dumb, but it may be
a smart dumb.

04:52.830 --> 04:56.080
Our visions go from our eyes
into our brains, right?

04:56.080 --> 04:59.460
So we just need to harness
our kinetic energy through

04:59.460 --> 05:00.750
some sort of...

05:01.620 --> 05:03.080
scientific device.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.040
Okay, Mom.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.670
You ready to connect our
psychic energy?

05:08.670 --> 05:09.580
I'm ready.

05:09.580 --> 05:10.500
Okay.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.750
Commence friction.

05:11.750 --> 05:12.670
Now!

05:14.000 --> 05:14.920
Faster!

05:14.920 --> 05:15.880
Friction!

05:19.040 --> 05:20.500
-Like that?
-Oh, yeah.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.000
Activating Psychic Duo powers...

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
-Uh-huh.
-...now!

05:26.080 --> 05:27.170
-Ahh!
-Oh!

05:27.170 --> 05:28.170
Oh! Ooh!

05:28.170 --> 05:29.960
I think my wig flew off.

05:31.210 --> 05:32.040
Ya think?

05:40.120 --> 05:42.500
Being a super hero
certainly has its perks.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.170
Walnut?

05:46.170 --> 05:47.170
No, thanks.

05:47.170 --> 05:49.500
I'm researching
falcon flight patterns.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.040
"Psychic Duo."

05:52.040 --> 05:53.210
You know,

05:53.210 --> 05:54.580
I may not have visions,

05:54.580 --> 05:57.040
but I can have
a super hero name too.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.620
I'm smart and logical.
I can be...

06:00.880 --> 06:02.880
Logi-Gal.

06:02.880 --> 06:03.920
Get it?

06:03.920 --> 06:05.040
Got it.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.330
It's "terri-bal!"

06:07.620 --> 06:09.250
Hey, mind if
I open your window?

06:09.250 --> 06:11.830
Are you trying
to catch the falcon
with a net?

06:11.830 --> 06:14.250
Nah. I have to clean up
my dog's poop,

06:14.250 --> 06:15.880
and I don't feel
like going downstairs,

06:15.880 --> 06:17.540
so I'll bring
the poop to me.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.250
That just gave me
a great idea.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.830
You wanna bring
the poop to me?

06:23.830 --> 06:25.210
Uh, no, no. No.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.830
I wanna bring the bird to me.

06:27.830 --> 06:29.210
Cool!

06:29.210 --> 06:31.120
Could we use Levi as bait?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.620
I dare you.

06:36.170 --> 06:37.540
Don't worry, Levi.

06:37.540 --> 06:39.120
I've got a different
kind of bait.

06:39.120 --> 06:39.960
Let's go.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.000
As we've learned,

06:43.000 --> 06:44.960
you can't force a vision.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.830
But by using the power of yoga,

06:47.830 --> 06:49.710
it will allow you
to relax

06:49.710 --> 06:51.790
so your visions come naturally.

06:51.790 --> 06:53.670
Ain't nothing natural
about this, Chels.

06:54.540 --> 06:55.250
Ow!

06:56.210 --> 06:57.040
Yeah, this looks promising.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.170
(Chelsea clears throat)

06:59.170 --> 07:00.170
Namaste.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.120
Nah, I'm not gonna stay.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.040
I'm not gonna stay.

07:03.330 --> 07:05.250
Okay, guys, I think
I have a way to fix this.

07:05.250 --> 07:08.040
I found a bird calling app
that's guaranteed to
attract falcons.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.120
(laughs) A bird calling app?

07:10.120 --> 07:11.210
Talk about dumb.

07:11.210 --> 07:12.670
Uh-uh! Zip it, booker.

07:12.670 --> 07:14.920
'Cause her dumb might be
smarter than your smart dumb

07:14.920 --> 07:16.250
which turned out
to just be dumb.

07:16.250 --> 07:17.790
Excuse me.

07:17.790 --> 07:19.040
Go ahead, baby,
show me what you got.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.210
-All right.
-(bird screeches
through phone)

07:20.210 --> 07:21.170
Come to mama.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.170
Wait, it's working!

07:24.170 --> 07:26.000
Oh, are those falcons?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.290
-(feathers ruffling)
-That's a lot of falcons.

07:27.290 --> 07:28.290
Is one of them
carrying my money?

07:28.290 --> 07:29.960
They're not falcons!

07:29.960 --> 07:31.210
-Huh?
-They're pigeons!

07:31.210 --> 07:33.750
Is one of them
carrying my money?

07:33.750 --> 07:35.330
-(wings flapping)
-Just run!

07:35.330 --> 07:38.330
(all shouting)

07:38.330 --> 07:40.290
I know Ernesto is coming.

07:40.290 --> 07:42.580
I am not running!

07:44.120 --> 07:45.040
(bird screeches)

07:48.330 --> 07:49.170
I should have ran.

07:56.920 --> 07:57.960
That's it!

07:57.960 --> 07:59.040
We tried...

07:59.040 --> 08:00.880
conjuring visions...

08:00.880 --> 08:02.750
rooftop yoga...

08:02.750 --> 08:04.330
bird calling apps.

08:04.330 --> 08:05.290
It's gone!

08:07.330 --> 08:08.330
My money's gone!

08:09.290 --> 08:11.120
Man:
I wish you were gone, lady!

08:13.330 --> 08:15.290
Anybody want guacamole?

08:15.290 --> 08:17.330
Ooh, yeah.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.790
(pounds fist on table)

08:22.250 --> 08:23.710
Hey, did you just make that?

08:23.710 --> 08:25.330
No, it was right there
on the counter.

08:26.170 --> 08:27.080
I'll get the chips.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.750
No, we like them uncrushed.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.040
I'll get them.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.880
Wow. Sounds like someone's
a little anti-Cemento.

08:34.330 --> 08:35.620
It's gone!

08:35.620 --> 08:37.120
My money's gone!

08:38.420 --> 08:40.170
And so is my zipline!

08:40.170 --> 08:42.120
Now I gotta walk to the fridge.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.920
Mom, I just had a vision!

08:55.920 --> 08:58.750
Oh! Oh, it makes me
so happy that my baby
says that.

08:58.750 --> 08:59.670
What'd ya see?

08:59.670 --> 09:01.790
I saw Ernesto
sitting on a bench

09:01.790 --> 09:03.460
right outside
of Polar Bear Pizza.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.960
And he was holding your money!

09:04.960 --> 09:06.170
-My money!
-That's what I said.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.880
-Uh-huh.
-Come on, let's go get him.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.380
This looks like a job
for the Psychic Duo!

09:11.920 --> 09:13.420
Oh, okay, baby, you stay here

09:13.420 --> 09:15.170
and just make sure
that your bird app works, okay?

09:15.170 --> 09:16.210
Oh, okay.

09:16.210 --> 09:17.330
-Ah!
-I'm psychic!

09:18.000 --> 09:18.920
(door closes)

09:18.920 --> 09:19.880
You hear that?

09:20.920 --> 09:22.750
Mom gave me a mission
and I'm gonna do it.

09:22.750 --> 09:23.790
Yeah!

09:23.790 --> 09:26.620
Logi-Gal will find you, Ernesto!

09:26.620 --> 09:28.000
Man:
My name's Stanley!

09:28.000 --> 09:28.920
Nice to meet you, Stan--

09:28.920 --> 09:29.790
Quiet!

09:32.290 --> 09:33.750
We're coming for you, Ernesto.

09:33.750 --> 09:34.710
Yeah!

09:34.710 --> 09:35.750
(door opens)

09:36.580 --> 09:39.620
-Hey--
-I know I didn't use
the Scut App,

09:39.620 --> 09:42.500
but I really need
to get Carmichael to
the vet's office.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.670
-(meows)
-He has leaky bowels.

09:44.670 --> 09:47.120
Uh-uh, uh-uh!
No, no, no. I can't
help you, lady.

09:47.120 --> 09:47.960
Uh-uh,
I'm off-Scuty.

09:48.670 --> 09:49.830
How's a hundred bucks?

09:49.830 --> 09:52.000
Welcome to your Scut Ride.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.790
Mom, what about the falcon?

09:53.790 --> 09:54.710
Oh, don't worry about that.

09:54.710 --> 09:56.120
The pizza place
is on the way to the vet.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.670
Besides, I just got me
a crisp, new hundred.

09:57.670 --> 09:58.380
Buckle up!

10:03.790 --> 10:05.420
Hey, what are you working on?

10:05.790 --> 10:08.170
Finding that falcon,
saving that money.

10:08.170 --> 10:09.710
Check you out.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.080
Find that falcon,
find that falcon,
find that falcon.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.250
If I just found out my mom
and brother both have visions,

10:16.250 --> 10:17.540
I'd be a little bummed.

10:17.540 --> 10:19.040
But not you.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.500
Nope.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.500
Not me.

10:22.420 --> 10:26.710
Hey, you know it's okay
not to be okay, right?

10:26.710 --> 10:28.210
Really, Tess, I'm fine.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.750
Nia, come on.
It's me.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.380
Look, I guess I'm just not
having the best day, okay?

10:36.380 --> 10:39.750
This morning,
Booker and I were on
the same team.

10:39.750 --> 10:42.710
Trying to spend the money,
find the money,
hide the money.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.210
And now he's part of
this Psychic Duo

10:45.210 --> 10:47.290
and I'm getting yelled at
by weird Stanley.

10:47.290 --> 10:48.710
Stanley:
I heard that.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.540
Remind me to close that window.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.500
You think you had
a bad day?

10:55.500 --> 10:58.420
I got dunked on
by somebody's mother!

10:58.420 --> 11:00.420
You know how much
street cred I lost?

11:00.420 --> 11:01.250
Yeah.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.670
That's the first smile
I've seen out of you all day.

11:04.670 --> 11:06.460
Glad my pain
could cheer you up.

11:07.170 --> 11:08.880
You're my best friend, Tess.

11:09.540 --> 11:10.670
You always cheer me up.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.040
Thank you.

11:12.040 --> 11:15.120
Stanley: Oh, man! I just
stepped in some dog poop!

11:15.120 --> 11:16.880
Ah, that reminds me.

11:16.880 --> 11:17.710
Yeah.

11:19.420 --> 11:20.880
I'll let you-- Yeah.

11:25.540 --> 11:26.460
Look, Mom!

11:26.460 --> 11:27.380
There it is.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.540
Booker:
Just like in my vision.

11:31.460 --> 11:33.420
Ernesto!

11:35.380 --> 11:37.000
This isn't my vet's office.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.080
Don't backseat Scut me, ma'am.
I'm trying to make a quick stop.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.250
Yeah, that falcon
owes us some money.

11:42.250 --> 11:43.080
(Carmichael hisses)

11:43.080 --> 11:46.420
Falcon? Carmichael
hates falcons.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.170
(hisses, meows)

11:48.170 --> 11:49.920
Carmichael, no!

11:49.920 --> 11:52.210
Carmichael!

11:52.210 --> 11:54.790
Ernesto!

11:54.790 --> 11:56.960
Could this day
get any worse?

11:57.920 --> 11:59.080
Hey, hey, hey!

11:59.080 --> 12:00.420
That's my hundred! That's mine!

12:02.580 --> 12:05.000
Who's ready for Taco Tuesday?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.580
Mom, it's Saturday.

12:06.580 --> 12:09.290
Well, you hate
Sardine Saturday,
so I'm just mixing it up.

12:11.170 --> 12:12.580
That's who I lost to.

12:14.420 --> 12:15.920
Well, we've got some good news.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.120
You found the money?

12:17.120 --> 12:18.380
Unfortunately, no.

12:18.380 --> 12:20.290
But our day was not
a total loss.

12:20.290 --> 12:21.960
We did find these.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.330
Both:
Bam!

12:24.460 --> 12:26.170
Those say
"I'm with psycho."

12:26.170 --> 12:29.040
It's all they had,
but if we'd found
the money,

12:29.040 --> 12:30.710
we'd have customized...

12:30.710 --> 12:33.500
Both:
Psychic Customizers!

12:33.500 --> 12:35.790
Both: I knew you were
going to say that!

12:37.040 --> 12:39.460
Guys, does anyone care
about the money?

12:39.460 --> 12:40.920
Of course we care
about the money.

12:44.380 --> 12:45.710
You saved her!

12:49.250 --> 12:50.620
Both:
I just had a vision!

12:50.620 --> 12:51.540
(gasps)

12:51.540 --> 12:52.880
Double vision!

12:52.880 --> 12:54.580
(squealing)

12:54.580 --> 12:59.290
I don't know
about yours, but in mine,
Levi said I saved someone.

12:59.290 --> 13:00.250
Mine too!

13:00.250 --> 13:02.170
We're gonna be heroes!

13:02.170 --> 13:03.040
Whoo!

13:03.040 --> 13:04.960
Both: Oh! Oh!

13:04.960 --> 13:07.420
Let me get that,
let me get that.
Let me get that, oh, oh!

13:07.420 --> 13:09.000
Let me get that, oh yeah!

13:09.000 --> 13:11.500
Rain drops, oh, oh!

13:11.500 --> 13:13.500
Oh, yeah!

13:13.500 --> 13:15.290
Shredded lettuce, coming up!

13:18.460 --> 13:20.170
(deep voice): No!

13:20.170 --> 13:21.380
(deep voice): No!

13:33.750 --> 13:35.290
You saved her!

13:35.290 --> 13:36.170
Nia?

13:36.170 --> 13:38.040
No, my fist.

13:38.040 --> 13:41.790
I call it her
because him seems
a little on the nose.

13:42.710 --> 13:43.830
Where is Nia?

13:44.500 --> 13:46.620
Probably right where
you threw her.

13:47.420 --> 13:48.540
Baby girl?

13:48.540 --> 13:49.710
You okay?

13:51.170 --> 13:52.210
Yeah.

13:54.580 --> 13:55.960
I just had a vision.

13:57.330 --> 13:58.830
Aw, yay!

14:00.620 --> 14:01.500
Mm!

14:07.170 --> 14:08.460
You hear that, everybody?

14:08.460 --> 14:10.580
I got twin psychic babies!

14:10.580 --> 14:12.290
Come give
your psychic mama
a hug!

14:12.290 --> 14:13.750
Ahh!

14:13.750 --> 14:17.170
Mama, I think you're squeezing
the psychic out of me.

14:17.170 --> 14:18.120
Sorry.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.500
So I guess the Psychic Duo
is now a Psychic Trio.

14:21.500 --> 14:22.790
When do I get
my T-shirt?

14:22.790 --> 14:24.170
T-shirts don't matter, baby.
Spill the vision.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.210
Yeah, what'd you see?

14:27.210 --> 14:28.380
Yeah, do I get my money?

14:28.380 --> 14:29.880
Please tell me
I get my money.

14:29.880 --> 14:31.460
You get your money back.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.170
(high-pitched squealing)

14:33.170 --> 14:35.080
-How?
-Oh

14:35.080 --> 14:37.790
Ooh. Does she fight a falcon?
'Cause she will.

14:37.790 --> 14:38.790
I will.

14:38.790 --> 14:39.790
-She will.
-You know I will, girl.

14:39.790 --> 14:42.210
I will fight,
I will whoop a falcon.

14:42.210 --> 14:44.210
-Is that what happens?
-No.

14:44.210 --> 14:45.500
Does the falcon whoop me?

14:45.500 --> 14:46.540
-No.
-Okay.

14:46.540 --> 14:48.120
Then what'd you see?

14:48.830 --> 14:49.880
Uh...

14:50.880 --> 14:52.250
A pointy thing.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.210
Booker's head!

14:56.250 --> 14:57.170
What?

14:57.170 --> 14:58.420
They can't all be winners.

14:58.420 --> 14:59.880
No.

14:59.880 --> 15:00.750
The roof.

15:01.540 --> 15:03.080
The pointy thing on the--
(gasps)

15:03.080 --> 15:05.170
The turret, the turret,
You're talking about the turret.

15:05.170 --> 15:05.880
Is my money up there?

15:06.500 --> 15:07.960
Uh... the--

15:07.960 --> 15:10.250
No! No. There's a taco.

15:11.170 --> 15:13.080
There's a taco on the turret?

15:13.670 --> 15:18.210
No, no. You're--
You're dressing like a taco
on the turret.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.290
Oh, yeah.

15:19.290 --> 15:20.250
That makes more sense.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.830
Wait, so is that when
the falcon comes

15:22.830 --> 15:24.120
and I get my money?

15:25.580 --> 15:27.290
-Exactly.
-(Raven gasps)

15:27.290 --> 15:29.880
Wait, why is she
dressed like a taco?

15:29.880 --> 15:31.120
Never doubt the vision, Booker.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.880
-Yeah, Booker.
-Never doubt the vision.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.880
-I won't.
-Come here, baby.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.670
-Hey.
-Ah, she's so cute!

15:37.420 --> 15:39.880
-I'ma go get my money.
-All right.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.500
Okay, come on you two.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.170
If there's any chance
Raven's gonna fight a falcon,

15:44.170 --> 15:45.420
we wanna get front row seats.

15:45.420 --> 15:46.920
My money's on the falcon.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.250
All right, well, that'll be
the second bet you lose today.

15:51.540 --> 15:54.540
So, look at us,
just a couple of psychics.

15:54.540 --> 15:57.420
Yeah, so, uh, how did it feel
when you got your vision?

15:57.420 --> 15:59.290
Well, you know,
it was... visiony.

15:59.290 --> 16:02.210
Oh, yeah, yeah. And the whoosh
when it goes into your eyes?

16:02.210 --> 16:04.210
Oh, so whooshy.
The whooshiest.

16:04.210 --> 16:07.420
Oh, yeah. Do you-- Do you
suddenly smell burnt corn
like me and Mom do?

16:07.420 --> 16:09.880
Totally, like the bad popcorn
that gets stuck on the bottom.

16:09.880 --> 16:12.420
Oh, my bad, I meant
just like regular corn.

16:12.420 --> 16:14.330
Yeah, yeah, regular corn.

16:14.330 --> 16:15.620
At first, I thought
it was burning, but then--

16:15.620 --> 16:17.210
There is no corn!

16:18.380 --> 16:20.290
Well, maybe my visions
are different than yours.

16:20.290 --> 16:21.920
No corn!

16:23.330 --> 16:24.290
Candy corn?

16:24.290 --> 16:27.620
Mm-mm.

16:27.620 --> 16:28.620
Okay, fine.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.040
I lied, happy?

16:30.290 --> 16:32.620
I'm not psychic.
I guess the fact
that you are

16:32.620 --> 16:35.170
helps you see that too.

16:35.540 --> 16:36.460
Nia,

16:36.460 --> 16:39.960
being psychic
has nothing to do with it.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.710
Being your twin brother

16:41.710 --> 16:43.460
helps me see things too.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.670
Like...
when you're not happy,

16:46.670 --> 16:49.250
and when you're
telling lies to hide it.

16:50.380 --> 16:51.500
Look,

16:51.500 --> 16:53.580
I know you were
feeling left out.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.000
You could see that?

16:56.000 --> 16:57.420
Yeah.

16:57.420 --> 16:58.920
But, Nia,

16:58.920 --> 17:00.880
you gotta tell Mom the truth.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.620
-You didn't.
-This is different.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.540
No, it's not, Booker.

17:04.540 --> 17:07.040
You didn't want Mom
to take away your powers.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.750
Well, I don't want
her to take away
my powers.

17:08.750 --> 17:10.670
You don't have powers!

17:14.080 --> 17:17.080
But did you see the way
she looked at me when
she thought I did?

17:17.080 --> 17:20.620
When I wasn't just... regular.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.420
Wow.

17:23.540 --> 17:24.670
You went deep.

17:26.580 --> 17:28.750
But... I get it.

17:29.580 --> 17:32.080
And... I've got your back.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.460
Thank you.

17:37.790 --> 17:41.080
Besides, it's not like Mom
is gonna take all that crazy

17:41.080 --> 17:42.960
you were spilling
seriously anyway. I mean--

17:42.960 --> 17:45.500
-"dress like a taco."
-I know, I saw the taco shell.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.920
There's a lot of
temp jobs I wasn't proud of.

17:49.460 --> 17:52.540
But my stint as Taco Shelley
wasn't one of them. Ha, ha, ha!

17:52.540 --> 17:55.620
I was sign twirler
of the month twice!

17:55.620 --> 17:57.120
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:57.120 --> 17:58.750
I've gotta to get that money.

17:58.750 --> 17:59.710
(laughs)

18:01.920 --> 18:03.710
Both:
Taco suit!

18:08.540 --> 18:09.580
Oh!

18:09.580 --> 18:10.750
(groans)

18:10.750 --> 18:12.540
Where are you at, Ernesto?

18:13.500 --> 18:14.670
Careful, Rae!

18:15.670 --> 18:16.620
Oh, I'm not worried.

18:16.620 --> 18:19.040
Nia had a vision!

18:19.040 --> 18:20.540
That is nuts.

18:20.540 --> 18:23.540
That she climbed
all the way up there
based on a vision?

18:23.540 --> 18:26.620
No. That she owns
a taco suit.

18:28.580 --> 18:29.620
Where's Mom?

18:29.620 --> 18:30.830
Where Nia told her to go.

18:31.830 --> 18:33.540
She really went up?

18:34.580 --> 18:36.040
Here Ernesto!

18:36.040 --> 18:38.500
It's your taco fiesta.

18:40.170 --> 18:42.170
Mom, are you okay?

18:42.170 --> 18:46.000
Well, your vision didn't see me
ending up as sidewalk taco meat
so we all good!

18:46.000 --> 18:47.040
Oh, oh!

18:47.040 --> 18:48.210
Cemento!

18:48.210 --> 18:49.790
Do something!

18:49.790 --> 18:53.040
You do know I'm not
an actual super hero?

18:53.040 --> 18:55.080
Oh, well not with
that attitude.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.580
Okay, I'm gonna
go get her.

18:57.580 --> 18:58.580
No.

18:58.580 --> 18:59.710
She's up there
because of me.

18:59.710 --> 19:00.580
I got this.

19:00.580 --> 19:01.960
Ooh, I was hoping
she was gonna say that.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.620
(groans)
Here, Ernesto.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.120
Hey, Mom.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.710
Ah! Oh, girl, you scared
the lettuce outta me.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.500
You gotta get down from here,
Nia. It's dangerous, honey.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.670
-Mom.
-Huh?

19:15.670 --> 19:16.670
Ernesto's not coming.

19:16.670 --> 19:18.000
No, no, no, no. Yes, he is.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.750
'Cause I'm in a taco
on the turret

19:19.750 --> 19:20.880
just like you saw.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.080
-Mom.
-Huh?

19:22.080 --> 19:23.540
I didn't see anything

19:23.540 --> 19:24.830
because I didn't
have a vision.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.710
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This wind, Nia, let me hear.

19:26.710 --> 19:27.670
What'd you say?

19:27.670 --> 19:28.710
I didn't have a vision.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.670
I heard what you said, Nia.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.170
Really?

19:33.170 --> 19:34.620
Why would you make
something like this up?

19:34.620 --> 19:36.170
I apologize, Mom.

19:36.170 --> 19:38.120
It's just that,
you and Booker, you--

19:38.120 --> 19:39.790
you have this
Psychic Duo thing

19:39.790 --> 19:42.500
and you seemed so happy
when you heard that he had
visions like you.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.620
I just wanted to think
that I was like you too.

19:44.620 --> 19:46.330
Are you serious?

19:46.330 --> 19:48.880
Are you serious, baby?
I don't care that you don't
have visions.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.210
You don't?

19:50.210 --> 19:52.210
So it's okay
that I'm just regular?

19:53.120 --> 19:54.330
Regular?

19:54.330 --> 19:56.880
Oh, baby girl,
you are so far from regular.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.620
But you and Booker
can see the future.

19:59.620 --> 20:01.790
Yeah, and where has
that gotten us today?

20:02.880 --> 20:03.880
Honestly,

20:03.880 --> 20:05.040
I don't have my money.

20:05.040 --> 20:08.170
And you, you feel left out
and I don't like that.

20:08.170 --> 20:10.830
Visions aren't all
what they're cracked up to be.

20:10.830 --> 20:11.880
-They aren't?
-No.

20:12.830 --> 20:13.750
(sigh) Not at all, sweetie.

20:13.750 --> 20:14.790
You can't count on them,

20:14.790 --> 20:17.750
and, uh, most of
the time they're wrong.

20:17.750 --> 20:21.540
Listen, your brother and I
may share the fact that
we have visions, right?

20:21.540 --> 20:23.120
But you and I share
a lot of things too, right?

20:23.120 --> 20:24.710
-Yeah.
-We share the fact that

20:24.710 --> 20:26.580
we're up here
on this turret together.

20:26.580 --> 20:28.290
-Yeah.
-And if we're lucky,

20:28.290 --> 20:30.040
we'll share the fact that
we're gonna get down
off this turret.

20:32.580 --> 20:33.880
All I'm saying is, Nia,

20:33.880 --> 20:36.670
you're just as important
as anybody else in this family.

20:36.670 --> 20:37.540
You hear me?

20:37.540 --> 20:39.080
Yeah.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.710
All right, so yes, your brother
and I, we are the Psychic Duo

20:41.710 --> 20:43.250
but you, me, and your brother...

20:44.710 --> 20:47.000
we will always be
Team Baxter. Okay?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.880
Yeah. Okay.

20:48.880 --> 20:49.830
So can we get t-shirts?

20:49.830 --> 20:50.960
Oh, can we get down?

20:50.960 --> 20:52.710
-Yeah, yeah, I got you.
-Okay.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.290
Ahh!

20:54.290 --> 20:55.920
(thud, crash)

20:55.920 --> 20:57.670
Oh!

20:57.670 --> 20:58.920
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much, Mom.

20:58.920 --> 20:59.790
You broke my fall.

20:59.790 --> 21:01.960
You broke my taco shell.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.210
-(bird squawks through phone)
-Nia, is that coming
from your butt?

21:04.210 --> 21:05.170
My app!

21:05.170 --> 21:06.880
Yeah, mine too.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.830
No, no, no.
My bird calling app.

21:08.830 --> 21:11.830
It must have triggered it
when I hit the ground.

21:11.830 --> 21:14.290
-(falcon screeches)
-(gasp) That's the falcon call.

21:14.290 --> 21:17.000
-Man, that almost
sounds real.
-I know.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.250
Levi:
And close.

21:18.250 --> 21:19.250
(gasps)

21:20.710 --> 21:21.880
Chelsea:
What? Levi!

21:21.880 --> 21:23.750
Okay, listen, don't move.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.880
There's a falcon
on your fist.

21:27.880 --> 21:28.960
And he's got the money.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.210
-My money.
-Okay, nobody move.

21:31.210 --> 21:32.920
Logi-Gal's got this.

21:43.830 --> 21:44.880
(excited squeals)

21:44.880 --> 21:45.750
Here, Mom!

21:45.750 --> 21:46.750
-(excited screams)
-Your money.

21:46.750 --> 21:48.790
(giggles, sighs)

21:49.880 --> 21:51.750
Wait, you just
snatched it.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.080
How is that logical?

21:53.080 --> 21:54.040
None of you thought of it.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.000
She right.

21:55.000 --> 21:55.960
She right.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.120
(falcon screeches)

21:57.120 --> 21:59.000
-(gasps)
-See ya.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.880
-  Adios , Ernesto!
-(Chelsea laughs)

22:01.750 --> 22:04.250
I'm so glad that you got
your money back, Mom.

22:06.170 --> 22:07.000
Our money.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.790
Yeah? Come on in here.

22:09.790 --> 22:10.790
Come here.

22:10.790 --> 22:11.880
(laughter)

22:14.330 --> 22:15.790
Ooh!

22:15.790 --> 22:18.750
Come on! Give someone else
a chance!

22:18.750 --> 22:20.120
What? She's still in there?

22:20.120 --> 22:21.080
Yeah!

22:21.080 --> 22:23.290
Hey, I saved it,

22:23.290 --> 22:26.080
I get to lay in it.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.040
Yeah!
