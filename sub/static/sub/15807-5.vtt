01:50.344 --> 01:51.542
oh, it's real.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.645
Oh!

01:53.714 --> 01:55.813
Oh, it's got an engine
and wheels and wings

01:55.882 --> 01:58.183
and a propeller and--oh,
I've got to tell somebody!

01:58.252 --> 01:59.951
Oh! Oh, boy!

02:00.020 --> 02:01.185
[Clanging]

02:01.254 --> 02:02.854
You stay right here!
Don't go away!

02:02.923 --> 02:04.189
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

02:04.258 --> 02:05.891
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

02:15.502 --> 02:16.935
How are we doing,
professor?

02:17.004 --> 02:17.969
How are we doing?

02:18.038 --> 02:18.903
Well,
it's remarkable.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.272
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

02:20.341 --> 02:22.040
Well, considering
the fact that this plane

02:22.109 --> 02:25.210
must have landed here
25 or 30 years ago,
it's remarkable.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.544
But can we get it
off the ground?

02:26.613 --> 02:29.147
Well, I don't know.
I'm not sure.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.381
Oh, it's too bad
i couldn't find

02:30.450 --> 02:31.650
a brand-new plane
that could fly.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.451
With a great big
powerful jet engine.

02:33.520 --> 02:37.289
Yeah. With a great big
powerful jet pilot.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.490
You know something?

02:38.559 --> 02:39.991
I believe this engine
could be repaired

02:40.060 --> 02:41.526
if I could fix
the fuel line.

02:41.594 --> 02:43.295
Then we're saved!
We can fly it
out of here!

02:43.364 --> 02:44.830
There's only
one problem, gilligan.

02:44.899 --> 02:45.997
None of us
knows how to fly.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.465
Well, we can learn,

02:47.534 --> 02:48.966
because the skipper was
on an aircraft carrier.

02:49.035 --> 02:51.203
Oh, a lot of good
that'll do us, gilligan.
I was cook.

02:51.271 --> 02:52.504
My roommate
was a stewardess.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.572
I knew a crop duster
once in Kansas.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.842
You see? With all
that experience,
we can do it.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.277
Gilligan, we haven't
got enough experience
to fly a kite.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.779
I'm afraid
the skipper's right.
We could never do it.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.782
We'd be better off
salvaging the parts
of the plane.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.918
Oh, well,
it was a peachy idea
while it lasted.

03:06.987 --> 03:07.986
See ya.

03:08.054 --> 03:09.454
Oh, let's go
fix dinner.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.790
Cheer up,
gilligan.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.825
Professor,
don't you think
it's worth a chance?

03:13.894 --> 03:16.761
That's all you'd get,
gilligan. One chance.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.763
Professor,
we've got one chance.
We've got to take it.

03:18.832 --> 03:19.797
We've got to take it!

03:19.866 --> 03:21.666
Now, come on, I'll
clean off the tail gear,

03:21.735 --> 03:23.168
gilligan, you get
that cockpit clean.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.602
Alright, I'll look
at this instrument panel.

03:24.671 --> 03:26.004
At the what?
The instrument
panel.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.706
Oh. Cockpit.

03:28.775 --> 03:31.142
Thurston, have you
any idea where we are?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.110
Not the faintest.

03:32.178 --> 03:35.147
[Yelling]

03:35.215 --> 03:35.914
Over here!

03:35.983 --> 03:37.815
Oh, yes.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.685
I'm telling you,
this is absolutely...

03:39.753 --> 03:41.352
Over there,
over there.

03:41.421 --> 03:42.654
Yes, yes. I heard the--
i heard the sound.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.424
Oh, thurston,
this is ghastly!

03:45.492 --> 03:47.592
Next time, we'll take
a live-in guide.

03:47.660 --> 03:48.860
Yes.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.329
Say, this instrument panel
is in pretty good shape.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.897
Good.
Then our chances
are better, huh?

03:52.966 --> 03:55.267
Oh, thurston!

03:55.335 --> 03:57.502
Gilligan was
absolutely right!

03:57.571 --> 03:59.270
It is an airplane!

03:59.339 --> 04:01.540
Obviously non-schedule.
Let's go, lovey.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.107
Gilligan:
Look at this!

04:03.176 --> 04:05.210
"The <i> spirit of the Bronx."</i>

04:05.278 --> 04:06.845
The <i> spirit</i>
<i> of the Bronx.</i>

04:08.315 --> 04:10.182
The <i> spirit</i>
<i> of the Bronx!</i>

04:10.251 --> 04:11.949
Say, that was
wrong way feldman's
plane.

04:12.018 --> 04:13.885
That's right.
The one he used on his
around the world trip.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.720
Looks like
more half-way
around the world.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.322
Wrong way feldman,
so that's what's
happened to him.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.524
It seems
like yesterday,

04:20.594 --> 04:22.527
and it was
really way back
in the thirties.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.496
I read all about him.
He was a great pilot.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.431
Not as far as howell
aircraft was concerned.

04:26.499 --> 04:28.634
We invested money
in his first plane.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.468
Yes, that was the one
that went non-stop

04:30.537 --> 04:32.470
from Chicago
to New Orleans.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.239
That was pretty good
for those days.

04:34.307 --> 04:36.474
He was supposed
to fly to Minneapolis.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.476
The fool flew
the wrong way.

04:38.545 --> 04:39.844
I guess that's how
he got his nickname, huh?

04:39.913 --> 04:41.480
No. He got that
during world war I.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.614
He bombed his
own airfield. Pow!

04:43.683 --> 04:45.250
Regardless, he still
did a lot for aviation.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.585
And at least
he was a pilot!

04:46.653 --> 04:48.252
For my money,
i wish he was
here right now.

04:48.321 --> 04:51.857
Oh, I can still
remember him
from the newsreels.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.425
That jet-black hair
and that slim waist

04:54.494 --> 04:56.128
and that
flying suit.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.929
And that wonderful
white scarf,

04:57.998 --> 04:59.831
flying in the wind.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.634
Aw, poor wrong way.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.736
I wonder if there's
a chance he could
have survived.

05:04.805 --> 05:05.703
On the contrary,

05:05.772 --> 05:07.438
wrong way feldman
has gone

05:07.507 --> 05:10.809
to the great hangar
in the sky.

05:10.877 --> 05:14.245
Knowing wrong way,
it's hard to tell
which way he went.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.982
I'll tell you where I went.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.083
I'm right here.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.218
Oh!
I don't believe it!

05:20.287 --> 05:22.921
Wrong way,
you're alive?

05:22.989 --> 05:24.556
Surprised, huh?

05:24.624 --> 05:28.492
Well, but how
did you manage
all these years?

05:28.561 --> 05:30.328
Are you--are you really
wrong way feldman?

05:30.396 --> 05:31.996
Who else could I be?

05:32.065 --> 05:34.366
I've been alone
on this island
all these years.

05:34.434 --> 05:38.169
And then I saw
this young fella
nosing around my plane.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.638
Oh, I'm gilligan,
Mr. feldman, sir.

05:40.707 --> 05:43.442
You may call me
wrong way.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.977
Thank you. Thank you,
and this is Mrs. howell

05:46.046 --> 05:47.578
and the skipper
and the professor--

05:47.647 --> 05:49.981
oh, madam,
you are beautiful.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.118
Gilligan:
And that's Mr. howell.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.252
Certainly.
It would be.

05:54.321 --> 05:55.620
Come along, lovey.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.822
You see, thurston's
just a little bit
jealous.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.691
I'm not jealous.
I just don't want him

05:59.760 --> 06:03.528
slobbering over
those expensive gloves.
Come along.

06:03.597 --> 06:06.464
Boy, stranded
on the same island
with wrong way feldman.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.532
We sure are lucky!

06:07.600 --> 06:09.534
Oh, thank you,
gilligan.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.102
You're
an amazing man.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.204
How did you
manage to survive
all these years?

06:13.273 --> 06:14.906
Physical fitness,
iron will,

06:14.975 --> 06:17.709
perseverance, and
64 bottles of scotch.

06:17.778 --> 06:18.677
Scotch?

06:18.745 --> 06:19.944
Where did you
get the scotch?

06:20.013 --> 06:20.812
In with my provisions.

06:20.881 --> 06:21.913
You know,
i had everything.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.781
I had food,
gasoline, magazines--

06:23.850 --> 06:25.784
gasoline?
You had gasoline?

06:25.853 --> 06:26.617
Well, certainly.

06:26.686 --> 06:27.518
Why didn't you
fly out of here?

06:27.587 --> 06:29.054
With that engine?

06:29.122 --> 06:30.922
After the first 3 years,
i gave up trying to fix it.

06:30.990 --> 06:31.856
That's hopeless.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.458
Oh, wait a minute.
Maybe it isn't.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.559
With the spare parts
i salvaged from the boat,

06:34.627 --> 06:36.027
I might be able to fix it.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.463
You can fix
a kreider-reichman?
A kr-21?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.231
Well, I'll certainly
give it a try.

06:40.300 --> 06:43.434
That's the spirit!
You fix her up,
I'll fly her right out!

06:43.503 --> 06:45.837
Mr. wrong way, you're
the best thing that
ever happened to us.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.273
Just a minute now.
There's much work
to be done.

06:48.341 --> 06:49.941
That's right, men.
We've got much
work to do.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.843
Wrong way,
the supply hut's
this way.

06:51.912 --> 06:52.978
Oh, alright.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.016
Professor, this bolt's
the wrong size.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.352
See if there's some others
in the toolbox, will you?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.353
Alright, skip.

07:02.422 --> 07:07.025
Wrong way: Possibly,
this papaya punch is
partly past its prime.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.328
Well, it's hard
to believe.

07:10.397 --> 07:13.231
Planes without
propellers at
600 miles an hour?

07:13.300 --> 07:14.566
And some
go even faster.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.367
Yes. I certainly must
have missed a lot.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.270
New planes
and new inventions

07:19.339 --> 07:21.372
and no more
rumble seats.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.673
No more <i> Liberty</i>
magazine.

07:22.742 --> 07:24.109
And you missed
the second world war.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.310
The <i> second</i> one?

07:25.378 --> 07:26.611
So that's what
that was.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.646
I always wondered
what that noise was.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.649
Do you remember
the first world war?

07:30.717 --> 07:33.117
Do i--yes! I was an Ace,
my boy, an Ace.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.587
Oh, that was a big one.
No picnic up there.

07:35.655 --> 07:36.888
Dodgin' them bullets.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.891
Diving in and out
in my Bristol scout.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.460
Oh, and I met
some great pilots
in them days.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.929
You should have
seen my wing man--
bucky Lorenzo.

07:44.998 --> 07:45.497
He was good, huh?

07:45.566 --> 07:46.865
Good?!

07:46.934 --> 07:48.933
They still talk about
one flight he made.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.735
He downed
3 German planes

07:50.804 --> 07:52.736
and then strafed
a railroad yard.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.239
That sure is
a great story.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.406
He must have
been decorated.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.874
No. He was
court-martialed.

07:56.943 --> 07:57.975
Why?

07:58.044 --> 08:00.278
It was 3 years after
the war was over.

08:00.347 --> 08:03.681
Poor bucky. He certainly
upset the president.

08:03.750 --> 08:04.715
It's no good, professor.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.484
These bolts just
aren't usable.

08:06.553 --> 08:09.287
I've got an idea.

08:09.355 --> 08:10.922
I've got some
rusty bolts here.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.357
Have you got any
penetrating oil,
wrong way?

08:13.426 --> 08:14.225
Penetrating oil?
Oh, certainly.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.059
With
my provisions.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.427
Good. Let's go get it.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.496
With luck, we should
be through here
in a couple of hours.

08:18.565 --> 08:21.332
Oh, luck--that's
something everybody can
use one time or another.

08:21.401 --> 08:23.734
I remember once,
the 3 heinies
come at me--

08:23.803 --> 08:26.638
gilligan! Would you mind
coming here a moment?

08:30.677 --> 08:32.577
Hey, skipper, can't i
go with wrong way?

08:32.645 --> 08:34.346
Don't you want to help me,
little buddy?

08:34.414 --> 08:35.480
Oh, yes, sir.

08:35.549 --> 08:36.780
Thanks a lot,
gilligan.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.650
Now, would you mind
checking that rear wheel?

08:38.717 --> 08:39.351
I think it's loose.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.150
Yes, sir.

08:40.219 --> 08:42.187
I'll lift the tail.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.692
Well?

08:47.761 --> 08:48.593
Yeah,
it's a little loose.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.928
How loose?

08:49.996 --> 08:50.929
Uh--

08:53.734 --> 08:55.333
this loose.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.602
Gilligan, get something
to put under the tail
of the plane

08:57.670 --> 08:59.437
so we can put
the wheel back on!

08:59.505 --> 09:01.139
I'll get that rock
over there.

09:05.511 --> 09:06.944
I can't move it,
skipper.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.013
Would you like me
to help you, gilligan?

09:09.082 --> 09:10.015
Yeah,
that's a good idea.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.582
Oh, gilligan!

09:11.651 --> 09:12.784
Hurry up! It's slipping!

09:12.853 --> 09:14.419
It's beginning to sl--

09:14.487 --> 09:15.820
put it down now, gilligan.

09:20.526 --> 09:21.726
Oh!

09:21.795 --> 09:23.194
It's resting
on the ground.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.596
Gilligan, do you think
it's on the ground?

09:25.665 --> 09:27.866
It's on my foot!

09:27.935 --> 09:29.167
Lift!

09:33.140 --> 09:34.673
Skipper! Skipper!

09:50.556 --> 09:52.357
[Snoring]

10:01.168 --> 10:02.267
Wrong way?

10:09.176 --> 10:10.141
Wrong way?

10:13.513 --> 10:14.511
Wrong way!
Huh?

10:14.580 --> 10:16.447
Oh.

10:16.515 --> 10:18.716
Is there room
for me?

10:18.785 --> 10:22.587
No. Don't you have
a hammock of your own?

10:22.656 --> 10:26.123
Wrong way, I meant
on the plane.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.392
Can you take me with
you on the plane?

10:28.461 --> 10:30.561
No. It's a one-seater.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.264
Well...I'll
sit on your lap.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.533
Then I won't be able
to see where I'm going.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.868
Well, you can
sit on my lap.

10:37.937 --> 10:41.306
Oh, my feet won't
touch the pedals.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.673
Oh, please, wrong way,

10:42.742 --> 10:44.709
I've just got to get
back to Hollywood.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.477
If I don't get back
to Hollywood soon,

10:46.546 --> 10:48.813
my career
will be ruined.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.850
Please, wrong way.

10:51.918 --> 10:55.419
I can promise you
glamorous evenings...

10:55.488 --> 10:57.722
Moonlit nights...

10:57.790 --> 10:59.457
Just you and me.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.259
[Snoring]

11:05.031 --> 11:06.898
Think it over,
wrong way.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.603
Wrong way!

11:12.672 --> 11:14.471
Forget
the moonlight nights.

11:14.540 --> 11:15.940
You ain't going with me.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.341
"Moonlight nights"?

11:17.410 --> 11:19.744
I'm here to make you
a business proposition.

11:19.812 --> 11:22.246
Look, you take me
with you on the plane,

11:22.315 --> 11:25.883
and I'll make you
vice president of howell
aircraft corporation.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.452
We're on the big board
and you...Eh?

11:28.521 --> 11:32.857
I'll make you president
with stock options.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.826
Chairman of the board
with fringe benefits.

11:35.895 --> 11:37.395
Wrong way, I've got
to get off this island.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.697
If I don't, the howell
empire will crumble.

11:39.766 --> 11:43.034
It'll--one final offer,
wrong way.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.303
I'll give you
half interest of
everything I've got,

11:45.371 --> 11:47.338
my industries, my...

11:47.407 --> 11:52.110
I'll even give you
my--my very own
Teddy bear.

11:52.178 --> 11:53.144
Eh?

11:56.583 --> 11:59.084
[Snoring]

11:59.152 --> 12:01.486
A man makes a fair offer
and thieving...

12:01.555 --> 12:03.188
[Muttering]

12:08.828 --> 12:10.328
Apple pie order!

12:12.199 --> 12:14.031
Beautiful!

12:14.100 --> 12:15.133
Dirt.

12:16.136 --> 12:16.801
You stand by,
gilligan.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.069
Yes, sir.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.470
Professor, you've
done a great job.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.738
I'm quite satisfied.

12:20.807 --> 12:21.972
Well, thank you,
wrong way.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.408
Everyone's
worked very hard.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.377
Bless you all.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.511
Wrong way?

12:27.580 --> 12:28.880
Huh?

12:28.948 --> 12:30.248
Good luck.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.754
Well, Lindy
had sandwiches!

12:36.822 --> 12:37.855
Wrong way!

12:37.924 --> 12:39.256
Remember,
fringe benefits.

12:39.325 --> 12:40.791
Come back
for you know who.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.293
Oh, when you
get to Kansas,

12:42.362 --> 12:44.094
would you call
my uncle George and
aunt Martha, please?

12:44.163 --> 12:45.363
Oh, and when you
get to Hollywood,

12:45.432 --> 12:46.964
would you call
my agent and his wife?

12:47.033 --> 12:48.366
Whoever he's married
to this week?

12:48.435 --> 12:49.867
Please, please!

12:49.936 --> 12:52.403
I want you all
to understand,

12:52.471 --> 12:55.840
we ain't any more important
than any one of you.

12:57.144 --> 13:01.078
Although I'll be up there
risking my life...

13:01.147 --> 13:04.014
Still, it's
the team that counts.

13:04.083 --> 13:07.018
Alright,
clear the runway!

13:10.623 --> 13:11.555
Gilligan?
Yes, sir?

13:11.624 --> 13:12.690
Rudder?

13:12.759 --> 13:13.724
Check.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.193
Left wing flap?

13:15.262 --> 13:16.193
Check.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.496
Check.
Right wing flap?

13:18.565 --> 13:20.231
Stand by!

13:20.300 --> 13:21.365
Standing by.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.967
Contact!

13:29.709 --> 13:31.109
[Engine backfires]

14:20.994 --> 14:22.759

Yes, sir?

14:22.828 --> 14:24.562
Standing by.
Stand by.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.331
Alright, everybody,
clear the runway!

14:27.400 --> 14:28.399
Contact!

14:28.468 --> 14:30.101
Contact!

14:30.170 --> 14:32.469
[Engine sputters]

14:32.538 --> 14:33.804
Yay!
Yay!

14:33.873 --> 14:35.172
Ah, bravo!

14:35.241 --> 14:37.808
I'm taking her
straight up!

14:37.877 --> 14:39.110
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!

14:54.894 --> 14:56.961
Wrong way,
are you alright?

14:58.397 --> 14:59.631
Gilligan,
cut the motor!

14:59.699 --> 15:00.899
Yes, sir!

15:02.168 --> 15:04.936
First sign of trouble
and he bails out.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.405
Look at that!

15:07.473 --> 15:09.273
I wouldn't have
had no control
of the plane!

15:09.341 --> 15:11.476
You're right!
Somebody's tampered
with this strut,

15:11.544 --> 15:12.510
and it was
no accident.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.611
What do you mean?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.279
Somebody sabotaged
this plane.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.947
Yeah, and they
cut the strut, too.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.317
This is nonsense.
Who'd want
to wreck the plane?

15:19.386 --> 15:21.886
Maybe there's someone
else on this island
we don't know about.

15:21.955 --> 15:25.656
Maybe one of you
isn't so anxious
to have me fly for help.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.190
Oh, wrong way,
don't be silly.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.759
We all want
to be rescued.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.362
And soon.
I'm practically
all out of mascara.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.164
Nobody's more anxious
to be rescued than we are.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.799
That's right.
We told our chauffeur
to keep the motor going.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.768
Well, somebody
sabotaged this plane.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.136
And cut the strut.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.804
Couple of more minutes,
i could have been killed.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.673
Well, from now on,
we're not taking
any more chances.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.743
We men will stand
a 24-hour guard
around the plane.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.011
Hear, hear.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.346
Not you.

15:50.816 --> 15:52.817
Gilligan,
there are no more
bullets for the gun,

15:52.886 --> 15:54.952
so use
this bow and arrow
for protection.

15:55.021 --> 15:57.522
Don't worry, skipper,
I'll guard the plane.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.256
There, you see?

15:59.325 --> 16:00.524
Now, that's
for protection.

16:00.593 --> 16:01.525
Yeah.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.428
Don't let anyone
near the plane,

16:03.496 --> 16:04.929
'cause we don't know
who wrecked it.
Not anyone at all.

16:04.998 --> 16:05.796
Okay.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.464
Okay?
Yeah.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.500
I'll relieve you in
a couple of hours,
little buddy.

16:09.569 --> 16:10.601
Yes, sir.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.481
[Rustling]

16:24.550 --> 16:25.483
Who's there?

16:28.454 --> 16:29.053
Me.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.020
Who's me?

16:30.089 --> 16:31.723
It's me.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.258
Stay where you are, me.
How do I know it's you?

16:34.327 --> 16:35.426
Alright,
it's not me.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.661
It's the count
of monte cristo.

16:36.729 --> 16:37.862
I knew it!

16:37.931 --> 16:39.229
Oh, gilligan,
it's the skipper!

16:39.298 --> 16:40.464
I forgot my lantern.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.100
Say something
the skipper would say.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.235
Put down that
bow and arrow,
you idiot,

16:44.304 --> 16:46.037
or I'll break you
in half!

16:46.106 --> 16:47.404
That's the skipper,
alright.

16:47.473 --> 16:48.472
Oh!

16:48.541 --> 16:49.574
Oh!

16:52.612 --> 16:54.044
I wonder where
wrong way is.

16:54.113 --> 16:55.179
He said he wanted
to test the engine.

16:55.247 --> 16:56.647
Well, you know how he is.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.115
With his sense of direction,
if he started for the plane,

16:58.184 --> 16:59.917
he might have walked
straight into the ocean.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.152
I'm getting worried.
Gilligan went after him
20 minutes ago.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.921
Skipper?
Skipper?

17:03.990 --> 17:05.388
What is it,
gilligan?
Wrong way's gone.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.624
Gone?
What are you
talking about?

17:07.693 --> 17:09.560
His hut's a mess.
Everything's broken up
and thrown around.

17:09.628 --> 17:10.595
I thought maybe
he's a restless
sleeper, but--

17:10.663 --> 17:11.662
are you sure?

17:11.731 --> 17:13.130
He must have put up
an awful fight.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.164
Yeah, but
against what?

17:14.233 --> 17:15.031
Yeah,
against what?

17:15.101 --> 17:16.165
I don't know,

17:16.234 --> 17:17.435
but, look,
here's his scarf.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.440
We've got to spread out
and comb the island.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.875
Professor, you take
that direction,

17:23.943 --> 17:25.376
gilligan, you'll go to
the back of the island,

17:25.444 --> 17:26.710
and I'll go out to
the ocean, alright?

17:26.779 --> 17:28.179
Oh!

17:28.248 --> 17:30.281
Gilligan,
for goodness sakes!

18:08.687 --> 18:09.720
Aah!
Aah!

18:12.559 --> 18:13.658
Wrong way!

18:18.598 --> 18:19.630
Wrong way!

18:21.734 --> 18:23.534
Wrong way!

18:23.602 --> 18:26.170
Boy, I sure am
glad I found you!

18:27.706 --> 18:28.905
Where are
the kidnappers, huh?

18:28.974 --> 18:30.541
There ain't
no kidnappers.

18:30.609 --> 18:31.642
No kidnappers?

18:31.710 --> 18:32.643
It was a hoax.

18:32.712 --> 18:33.911
You were kidnapped
by a hoax?

18:33.979 --> 18:36.047
Can't you understand,
gilligan?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.848
I am a coward.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.249
What?

18:39.318 --> 18:41.618
Sure. I'm the one who
sabotaged that plane.

18:41.687 --> 18:43.855
I loosened
the propeller,
i cut the struts.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.457
After all these years,
i just couldn't
fly that plane.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.625
Oh, I'm washed up.
Through.

18:48.694 --> 18:52.963
Gilligan, I am
grounding myself.

18:53.032 --> 18:56.867
The way you were talking,
we all thought you wanted
to fly.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.604
It was just a front
for a man who's lost
his confidence.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.005
It would
have been better

19:01.074 --> 19:02.706
if I'd remained lost
to the world

19:02.775 --> 19:04.342
since I ain't got
nothing left
to give it.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.243
What about me?
You can teach me to fly,

19:06.311 --> 19:07.644
and I can take that plane
out of here.

19:07.713 --> 19:08.546
You fly the <i> spirit</i>
<i> of the Bronx?</i>

19:08.615 --> 19:09.579
Sure.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.082
Handle a kreider-
reichman kr-21?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.417
With you teaching me,
i can handle a kr--

19:13.486 --> 19:15.252
kreider-reichman.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.453
I can handle it.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.889
Gilligan,
i always fly
the wrong way.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.191
That's okay.
You point me
in one direction,

19:20.259 --> 19:21.192
and I'll go in the other.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.927
That just might work.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.895
At least it'd be
a chance to save
them people.

19:24.964 --> 19:25.762
We'll get started
right away.

19:25.831 --> 19:26.731
I'll go tell the others.

19:26.799 --> 19:27.898
You'll do nothing
of the kind.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.199
You'll stay right here.

19:29.268 --> 19:30.334
Them are the conditions
that prevail.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.836
As far as
they're concerned,

19:31.904 --> 19:33.704
you're going
to rescue them,
gilligan,

19:33.773 --> 19:37.909
and wrong way feldman
will remain lost
to the world,

19:37.977 --> 19:39.877
a legend
in his own time.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.146
Wrong way,
you're quite a guy,

19:42.214 --> 19:44.214
and whether
you think so or not,

19:44.283 --> 19:46.517
you deserve these wings.

19:58.964 --> 20:00.964
[Snoring]

20:01.033 --> 20:02.533
[Birds caws]

20:20.486 --> 20:21.986
Who goes there?

20:22.055 --> 20:23.153
My turn to--

20:23.222 --> 20:24.154
oh!

20:24.223 --> 20:25.156
Stand watch,
skipper.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.790
Professor, ha ha ha.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.759
Well, all's well so far.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.961
Gilligan will be here
at 6:00 to relieve you.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.396
Well, he's supposed to,

20:32.464 --> 20:33.931
but then you never know
what gilligan will do.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.632
Yeah, I know.

20:35.701 --> 20:36.801
Thanks.

20:36.869 --> 20:37.702
Goodnight, skip.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.836
Goodnight.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.907
Alright,
1, 2, 3, 4.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.009
We go through it again.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.977
The banana is
the oil pressure,

20:47.046 --> 20:48.078
the coconut
is the altitude,

20:48.147 --> 20:49.512
the pineapple
is the speed Gauge,

20:49.581 --> 20:51.081
the papaya's
the ignition.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.784
You got to keep your eyes
on the instruments
at all times.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.320
Alright.
Now get ready
for takeoff.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.656
First thing you do,
you flip on the ignition.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.425
No! No!
That's the altitude.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.160
I'm supposed to turn on
the papaya instead of
the coconut.

21:03.229 --> 21:03.861
Yeah.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.196
Yeah.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.298
Alright, now what's
the second thing you do?

21:07.366 --> 21:09.533
No, no, no.
What are you doing?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.269
My foot's asleep.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.941
Alright, 1, 2, 3, 4.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.277
We try it again.

21:19.345 --> 21:21.912
You are flying
at an altitude
of 30,000 feet.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.482
Suddenly, you encounter
headwinds of 80 miles
an hour.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.050
Show me what you do.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.985
No, no.
You're looping now.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.286
Now you're in
a power dive.

21:29.355 --> 21:30.354
Now you're in
a tailspin.

21:30.422 --> 21:32.289
Look out!
You're going to crash!

21:32.358 --> 21:33.724
You're going to crash!

21:33.793 --> 21:34.858
Crash?

21:34.927 --> 21:35.726
Yeah!

21:35.795 --> 21:36.961
Goodnight!
Goodnight!

21:38.230 --> 21:39.730
What'd you do that for?

21:42.502 --> 21:44.335
I don't think
that plane's too safe.

21:54.146 --> 21:54.979
Good morning, professor.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.113
I'll stand guard now.

21:56.182 --> 21:57.114
Oh, thanks, gilligan.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.348
I'll go wake up
the skipper.

21:58.417 --> 21:59.550
Now that it's getting light,

21:59.619 --> 22:00.784
we can start looking
for wrong way again.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.320
Right.

22:04.057 --> 22:07.224
Psst. Psst!
Hey, wrong way.

22:07.292 --> 22:08.692
Gilligan, are you sure
you want to go through
with this?

22:08.761 --> 22:09.960
Of course.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.728
Alright,
have you got
everything straight?

22:11.797 --> 22:13.264
On the takeoff,
what do you do
with the flaps?

22:13.332 --> 22:14.698
Put them down.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.400
No.
That's the throttle
you put down.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.568
I thought that was
the brakes.

22:17.636 --> 22:18.936
No. You got
to pay attention.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.270
You got a very short
runway here.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.371
You got to clear
them trees.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.639
Oh, don't worry
about them trees.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.274
Off I go
into the wild blue yonder.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.609
Never mind
the wild blue yonder.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.345
Just clear them trees.

22:28.447 --> 22:29.914
Alright.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.416
Okay, now, first,
check the instruments.

22:32.484 --> 22:34.251
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.218
What? What's the matter?

22:35.287 --> 22:36.420
I can't fly this plane.

22:36.488 --> 22:37.421
There's no fruit in here.

22:37.489 --> 22:38.556
I know what I'll do.

22:38.624 --> 22:39.957
I got a great idea.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.792
I'll go get a pineapple,
a papaya, and a coconut--

22:41.860 --> 22:43.260
gilligan!

22:43.329 --> 22:44.562
I've got the bananas.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.230
[Airplane motor]

22:46.298 --> 22:47.498
You heard it, skipper.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.932
It had to be our plane
that took off.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.734
Wrong way wouldn't leave
without telling us.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.970
Getting so a man
can't get any sleep
around here.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.372
Well, if it's true,

22:54.440 --> 22:56.006
I'm going to start packing
right after breakfast.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.174
I can't believe it.

22:57.243 --> 22:58.609
Gilligan
would have told us.

23:04.117 --> 23:05.383
Gilligan!

23:05.451 --> 23:06.917
Gilligan, little buddy,
are you alright?

23:06.986 --> 23:08.085
What happened?

23:08.153 --> 23:09.520
I tried to stop him.

23:23.269 --> 23:24.835
Is that wrong way
up there?

23:24.903 --> 23:27.471
Of course it is.
Can't you tell?

23:34.279 --> 23:35.379
Gilligan, what happened?

23:35.447 --> 23:37.280
Oh, it's a long story,
skipper.

23:37.349 --> 23:39.116
But there goes
the bravest man
I've ever known...

23:39.185 --> 23:40.785
Next to you.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.432
Announcer:
And New York is welcoming
wrong way feldman

23:55.501 --> 23:57.467
with its greatest
ticker-tape parade

23:57.536 --> 23:58.936
in honor of
the most remarkable

23:59.005 --> 24:01.271
'round-the-world flight
in history,

24:01.340 --> 24:05.042
33 1/2 years from the day
he left the Bronx.

24:05.111 --> 24:08.012
Wrong way has told
the authorities
a strange story

24:08.080 --> 24:09.346
of a deserted island

24:09.414 --> 24:10.780
with a group
of castaways

24:10.849 --> 24:12.483
who helped him
fix his plane,

24:12.552 --> 24:14.618
and the authorities
have made every effort

24:14.687 --> 24:16.854
to investigate
this possibility.

24:16.922 --> 24:20.891
Unfortunately,
wrong way's calculations
are so confused,

24:20.960 --> 24:23.193
the mysterious island
could be located anywhere

24:23.262 --> 24:26.564
between the bay of Naples
and the arctic ocean.

24:26.632 --> 24:29.500
Considering wrong way's
past reputation,

24:29.568 --> 24:32.503
this is obviously
another fantastic tale

24:32.572 --> 24:34.404
created from wrong way's
vivid imagination.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.072
In any event,

24:36.141 --> 24:39.376
wrong way feldman
is one of aviation's
great heroes,

24:39.445 --> 24:41.945
and he will
long be remembered
for the great heritage

24:42.014 --> 24:44.080
he leaves us.

24:44.149 --> 24:47.251
Our great hero
didn't leave <i> us</i> much.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.352
Oh, yes, he did.

24:48.421 --> 24:49.753
I got his wings.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.002
¶ Now this is the tale
of our castaways ¶

25:05.070 --> 25:06.703
¶ they're here
for a long, long time ¶

25:06.772 --> 25:09.339
¶ they'll have to make
the best of things ¶

25:09.408 --> 25:11.108
¶ it's an uphill climb ¶

25:11.176 --> 25:13.377
¶ the first mate
and his skipper, too ¶

25:13.446 --> 25:15.513
¶ will do their very best ¶

25:15.581 --> 25:17.481
¶ to make the others
comfortable ¶

25:17.550 --> 25:19.649
¶ in their tropic
island nest ¶

25:19.718 --> 25:20.851
¶ no phones, no lights ¶

25:20.919 --> 25:22.152
¶ no motorcars ¶

25:22.221 --> 25:23.954
¶ not a single luxury ¶

25:24.023 --> 25:26.390
¶ like Robinson crusoe ¶

25:26.459 --> 25:28.292
¶ it's primitive as can be ¶

25:28.360 --> 25:30.661
¶ so join us here
each week, my friends ¶

25:30.730 --> 25:32.695
¶ you're sure
to get a smile ¶

25:32.764 --> 25:35.399
¶ for 7 stranded
castaways ¶

25:35.468 --> 25:37.601
¶ here on
gilligan's isle ¶
