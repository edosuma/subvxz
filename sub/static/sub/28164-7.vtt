00:12.178 --> 00:13.013
Alyssa, wait!

00:13.096 --> 00:14.973
-Stay away from me!
-Please, Pete doesn't know.

00:15.056 --> 00:16.474
-That you're a werewolf?
-Shh.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.476
When were you going to tell me?
Were you going to?

00:18.560 --> 00:19.853
I was waiting for the right time.

00:19.936 --> 00:22.731
-The right time was before we made out!
-It's not contagious.

00:22.814 --> 00:25.483
-Not the point.
-Alyssa, I would never hurt you.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.527
How'd I know that?
I left my werewolf book at home.

00:27.610 --> 00:28.653
At least you have one.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.113
-Meaning what?
-Meaning I...

00:30.530 --> 00:32.866
-never asked for any of this!
-You think I did?

00:33.241 --> 00:34.534
I almost died today.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.162
But you didn't. Look, I saved you.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.329
Eventually.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.499
But you were more concerned
with protecting your secret. Why?

00:41.624 --> 00:44.586
-Because I thought you would be mad at me.
-I am mad at you!

00:44.753 --> 00:47.005
Because you could've handled this
a million different ways.

00:47.088 --> 00:48.673
Instead, we almost got killed,

00:48.757 --> 00:52.302
and your stupid grandfather wrecked that
Necrophone before we could even use it.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.471
And now I have to go tell Edward
that we failed.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.389
Oh, I'm sure Edward will be just fine.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.600
Again, not the point.

00:58.683 --> 01:01.436
No, the point is, he wasn't on
the front lines with us, was he?

01:01.519 --> 01:04.272
He's safe in his mansion
while we're off risking our lives

01:04.355 --> 01:06.608
to get what he wants.
He doesn't give a shit about you.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.986
-So why do you care about him so much?
-This is not about Edward or me.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.699
You, Jack, are the liar.
You, Jack, are the surprise werewolf!

01:14.783 --> 01:16.618
-Stop saying that.
-Werewolf. Werewolf.

01:16.701 --> 01:17.744
I fucked up.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.412
I'm sorry. Okay?

01:20.497 --> 01:21.372
Yeah.

01:21.456 --> 01:25.502
A half-hearted apology cures everything.
I'll just tell Edward that you're sorry.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.254
What are you gonna tell him?

01:30.173 --> 01:33.802
About what? About the Necrophone?
About you?

01:53.071 --> 01:53.905
[bang]

02:00.161 --> 02:00.995
[smack]

02:08.503 --> 02:11.381
-The best way to get over someone--
-Please, don't finish that sentence.

02:13.758 --> 02:14.717
[Pete] Look, sport.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.761
You're young.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.139
Girls will come and go.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.515
Not like Alyssa.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.267
I say good riddance.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.936
She's on the wrong team.
She's one of them.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.229
You don't even know her.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.065
She's been the best part
of this whole shit storm.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.692
She distracted you.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.278
She sucked you in.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.656
-It's time you got out.
-You're the one that wanted me to join.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.741
Now I see what it's doing to you,
I want you to quit.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.953
You don't know a damn thing
about what I'm going through, Pops.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.454
[Pete] We'll find another way.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.332
One that doesn't involve you
sleeping with the enemy.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.420
You don't care about how I feel.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.590
You just want me on side,
doing whatever you say.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.843
Maybe I just wanna go to college
and be a normal student.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.220
Look, I get it.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.473
You're tired. You're frustrated.

03:02.932 --> 03:03.766
Take a break.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.227
-Let me see if I can fix the damn thing.
-Yeah.  Get it fixed.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.646
Stick to the mission. Stay on target,
'cause God forbid

03:08.730 --> 03:10.690
things don't go according to your plan.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.235
We're supposed to be
on the same team here.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.445
We're not a team.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.780
I'm your good little soldier boy.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.450
-[smashing of glass]
-Jack.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.660
Jack, get back here!

03:23.369 --> 03:24.245
Jack!

03:26.539 --> 03:28.541
-Ah!
-[smack]

03:30.293 --> 03:34.047
WHERE IN THE WORLD
IS EDWARD COVENTRY?

03:44.807 --> 03:45.642
Huh.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.735
Trust me, as long as you go in after me,
whatever you did will seem tiny.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.781
I'm not in trouble. Yeah, I was the one
who found out Kyle was a werewolf.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.659
Kyle was a what?

04:03.409 --> 04:04.244
Werewolf.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.789
Don't worry. He's been dealt with.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.918
They'll probably give me a medal.

04:12.543 --> 04:13.920
They don't give out medals.

04:14.629 --> 04:15.797
Well, they could start.

04:16.798 --> 04:17.882
So, why are you here?

04:18.549 --> 04:20.343
I'm here because Jack Morton screwed up.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.845
And since I outrank him,
I get to answer for his mistakes.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.307
Yeah, he seems cool at first,
but he's kind of a loser.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.519
He's not a loser, he's just...
He's... complicated.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.194
You might wanna get your shit together
before you go in there.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.239
But don't let some townie get in the way
of everything you've worked for.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.908
Right. Thanks for the advice.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.204
Always happy to help the less fortunate.

04:48.913 --> 04:49.956
Miss Drake.

04:50.248 --> 04:53.084
I trust you have
what the Grand Magus is waiting for.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.796
I don't, but I can explain.

04:56.879 --> 05:00.967
Oh, good. An explanation is much better
than a rare magical artifact.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.552
Come on in and tell him then.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.596
Miss Dupres, I'll be with you shortly.

05:06.055 --> 05:06.973
Hey, Alyssa?

05:08.349 --> 05:09.350
Good luck.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.270
Hey, Acolyte? Clean this room.

05:15.064 --> 05:17.066
You heard the Medicum. Get to work.

05:17.608 --> 05:18.484
[sighs]

05:20.862 --> 05:21.863
[door bangs]

05:21.946 --> 05:23.406
[Vera] Now, Acolyte!

05:26.909 --> 05:27.785
[sighs]

05:41.507 --> 05:42.884
I told you to leave me alone.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.719
You didn't, actually.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.555
I can't believe you didn't tell me
about Kyle.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.516
That he's a total idiot?
Pretty sure I told you that.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.727
That he was a werewolf.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.438
Kyle's a werewolf?
Wait, did you say "was?"

05:55.521 --> 05:57.648
Yes, was. Past tense.
The Order killed him.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.234
-'Cause he was like you.
-I didn't know he was like us.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.194
Us?

06:02.028 --> 06:03.488
-So, there are others?
-Shit.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.323
-Alyssa--
-Did you frame him?

06:05.490 --> 06:07.909
Is that it?
Was it some messed-up jealousy thing?

06:08.242 --> 06:10.286
You seriously think I'd kill someone
out of jealousy?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.246
I don't think I trust a word you've said
to me.

06:12.663 --> 06:16.376
You know what? When you wanna talk,
we can do that. But for now, I'm going.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.922
-I want my thing back!
-No one's stopping you.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.134
[Vera] "Put the knife away."

06:25.301 --> 06:28.471
I can't think of a simpler request,
but you decided to keep it?

06:29.764 --> 06:31.265
I did, Magus.

06:31.474 --> 06:35.228
Because you think there are more
werewolves and you're, what, afraid?

06:35.603 --> 06:36.813
Yes. No.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.523
Well, that clears things up.

06:38.815 --> 06:42.193
When I was hunting alongside Kyle,
we saw a wolf.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.695
Which means there's another one out there.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.240
And I wanna find it.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.867
Gabrielle Dupres…

06:50.827 --> 06:51.744
werewolf slayer.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.454
Huh.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.832
When you had True Sight,

06:56.124 --> 06:57.834
did Kyle appear to you as a wolf?

06:59.043 --> 07:01.462
No. He looked like normal.

07:01.963 --> 07:05.133
Perhaps he tampered with the potion,
or he had someone help him.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.175
Either way,

07:06.467 --> 07:08.719
we don't need to trust our eyes.

07:09.554 --> 07:14.183
I do need to know how this happened.
When he turned, why, and most importantly,

07:14.642 --> 07:16.144
who else knows?

07:17.728 --> 07:19.147
Do you think you can handle that?

07:20.648 --> 07:21.941
Yes, Magus.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.402
You keep it quiet, but I need answers.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.737
But what if people lie?

07:27.697 --> 07:28.865
What if they don't talk?

07:28.948 --> 07:31.075
You're a smart girl. I'm sure you could...

07:31.617 --> 07:34.662
find some way to convince them.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.668
[door rattles open]

07:46.716 --> 07:48.926
[Lecturer] So, like a good husband,

07:49.010 --> 07:52.305
Orpheus follows Eurydice to Hades
to try and save her.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.266
Yeah, Orpheus was a fool.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.059
Interesting point.

07:57.894 --> 07:58.936
Counter?

07:59.520 --> 08:02.565
It's romantic.
Chasing your dead wife to Hell?

08:03.149 --> 08:05.818
If that's not true love,
then true love doesn't exist.

08:06.110 --> 08:06.944
No.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.613
He wasn't in love.

08:09.113 --> 08:10.031
Yes.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.657
Go with that.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.451
He felt obligated.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.621
And what did Eurydice do
to earn his sacrifice? Nothing.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.999
Not to mention, she just took off
to go dancing with the nymphs

08:20.082 --> 08:21.751
without even so much as a goodbye.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.670
[Jack] So, Orpheus wastes all
of this time and energy

08:24.754 --> 08:28.216
going after her to try
and justify their relationship.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.217
Aha.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.094
And then he finds Facebook pics
of Eurydice and her ex

08:32.178 --> 08:34.180
drinking caipirinhas in Costa Rica.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.015
Just like magic.

08:37.475 --> 08:38.559
Did I miss that part?

08:38.643 --> 08:41.395
Even if he got her back,
things could never be the same.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.856
So, did any of it
ever really mean anything?

08:43.940 --> 08:47.985
[Brandon] So you wouldn't even try
to save the person that you love?

08:48.069 --> 08:49.403
I'm saying that

08:49.820 --> 08:52.406
at a certain point,
you have to live your own life.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.243
Make choices for yourself
and not everybody else.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.921
Congratulations, Councilor Stone.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.049
You finally came to your senses.

09:11.425 --> 09:13.844
Forgive my hesitation, Magus.

09:13.928 --> 09:18.224
I just needed to consider
whether the promotion was a benefit to me

09:18.683 --> 09:19.600
or The Order.

09:19.850 --> 09:20.726
To Vera.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.728
Serious as a heart attack.

09:22.937 --> 09:23.771
Ha.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.316
Now that the council's complete,

09:28.025 --> 09:29.777
we have some business to attend to.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.280
Renee's death has derailed my plan.

09:32.488 --> 09:36.409
Two of our disciples were almost killed,
and the Necrophone was badly damaged.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.911
It's a long shot,
but we may be able to salvage it.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.371
Magus, if I may?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.958
I've conferred with others on the council,

09:44.375 --> 09:47.003
and there are grave concerns

09:47.086 --> 09:49.463
about your pursuit
of the Vade Maecum Infernal.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.466
With the Vade Maecum,

09:53.259 --> 09:55.720
we can create a sustainable way of life.
We can...

09:56.053 --> 09:57.930
feed the hungry. We can cure cancer.

09:58.014 --> 10:01.475
Let me be more specific. What we're
wondering is, "What's in it for you?"

10:03.060 --> 10:04.770
Are you questioning my intentions?

10:05.354 --> 10:07.815
Isn't that the purpose of this Council?

10:08.232 --> 10:09.984
To act as a safeguard.

10:10.484 --> 10:13.487
Your job was to ensure
the Grand Magus got the Necrophone.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.407
My job was to perform
the Elemental Transference.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.200
-[Hemmings] And you failed.
-Well.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.494
Our spell was interrupted by a werewolf.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.622
Are you sure it was a werewolf?

10:23.372 --> 10:24.540
Two of my Acolytes saw it.

10:24.832 --> 10:28.002
[female] Magus, I've been looking
into the history of the Vade Maecum,

10:28.085 --> 10:29.879
and there's anecdotal evidence that

10:30.254 --> 10:33.257
-restoring the incantation can somehow--
-The book summons werewolves.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.470
Really, Vera? Are you suggesting
that we put our heads in the sand

10:37.553 --> 10:39.430
over one sighting and some stories?

10:39.847 --> 10:41.140
I am suggesting

10:41.766 --> 10:44.602
the council temporarily rescinds
its support

10:44.685 --> 10:46.896
for your pursuit
of the Vade Maecum Infernal.

10:48.105 --> 10:52.318
Until we can be certain that the risk
is worthy of our efforts.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.698
You all feel this way?

10:58.866 --> 10:59.784
Not all.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.579
Tomorrow morning. I'll come to your house.

11:03.996 --> 11:04.830
We'll talk.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.249
I look forward to it.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.255
[Randall] Goddammit, Hamish.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.216
Get it out, Hamish!

11:15.800 --> 11:18.135
-[Jack] Kyle is a dead werewolf.
-No "hello?"

11:18.636 --> 11:20.388
-Rude.
-[Lilith] Where've you been?

11:20.596 --> 11:22.890
I told you.
I was being hunted by a necromancer.

11:22.973 --> 11:23.808
-Oh.
-Oh?

11:23.891 --> 11:25.059
She could see the future.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.603
She had an army of dead bodies
and she was trying to kill me!

11:28.145 --> 11:30.147
-Did she get you?
-No, she didn't get me.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.274
-[plonk]
-Ha! Damn.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.192
Good one!

11:34.443 --> 11:36.612
I got stabbed, you know. Magic blade.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.490
-I know.
-Wound would not heal.

11:39.573 --> 11:43.244
-Thanks to your magic douche-posse.
-They're not my magic douche-posse.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.122
-And I told you how to fix it.
-You told us to read a book.

11:46.205 --> 11:49.375
You said, and I quote, "It's brown."

11:49.458 --> 11:51.168
So, thanks for that.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.046
[Jack sighs]

11:54.130 --> 11:57.508
I can't tell if you guys
are mad at me or not.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.593
We're just happy you're home.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.347
[Lilith] Ha! Suck it! Three in a row.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.640
Damn it, Hamish.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.728
[Jack] Well, for what it's worth,
it doesn't sound like The Order

12:08.811 --> 12:11.480
has any idea who's a wolf,
or how many there are,

12:11.564 --> 12:13.774
so... we might be safe.

12:14.316 --> 12:18.988
So, what was
this Magical Misery Tour all about?

12:19.071 --> 12:22.616
Coventry sent us to pick up this device
that lets you talk to the dead.

12:22.950 --> 12:26.287
Alyssa said it would help him
find someone, but she didn't say who.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.997
Ah. Does it work?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.123
Who'd you call?

12:29.915 --> 12:30.750
Your mom?

12:32.042 --> 12:35.087
If it was her,
not a version I wanna remember.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.631
Is that why you look like
someone killed your dog?

12:38.257 --> 12:42.261
That, and I'm pretty sure Alyssa hates me.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.431
I think he actually cares.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.391
-Genuine heartbreak face.
-Hey, man.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.728
-We've all been there.
-You've all lost a girlfriend

12:50.811 --> 12:54.607
after being hunted by a necromancer
for a magic phone that calls dead people?

12:55.357 --> 12:56.192
Yes.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.486
Metaphorically, yes.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.905
Fear not.

13:01.238 --> 13:05.326
The Knights of Saint Christopher
have a foolproof cure for a broken heart.

13:05.868 --> 13:06.911
Day-drinking!

13:07.536 --> 13:10.122
[Jack] This seems like your solution
for everything.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.041
To Kyle.

13:12.416 --> 13:13.375
-Fuck them.
-Nope.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.921
-Not toasting that dickleak.
-Guys, he was a Knight,

13:17.171 --> 13:19.006
even it was only for five minutes.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.134
And he sacrificed himself for us.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.552
That was cannon fodder.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.805
Come on. We're a brotherhood.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.890
Gender neutral collective.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.725
Thank you.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.895
Fine. To Kyle What's-His-Douche.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.773
-Long the road and short the life.
-Cheers.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.531
[ringing starts]

13:43.614 --> 13:46.033
[ringing]

13:46.534 --> 13:48.786
[Lilith] Magic? We just sat down.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.204
[Brandon] Should we?

13:51.038 --> 13:54.583
We should keep a low profile, at least
until we know how they were hunting us.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.211
No unnecessary transformations.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.088
Understood?

14:00.631 --> 14:01.715
Why are you looking at me?

14:04.885 --> 14:05.803
Fine.

14:06.804 --> 14:07.680
[door clicks]

14:09.932 --> 14:12.935
[male voice] See, I told you
rich assholes drink beer. Ha ha!

14:13.811 --> 14:14.979
Found my landing screw.

14:15.771 --> 14:16.689
Get me a beer.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.233
This is never good.

14:22.778 --> 14:23.654
Wow.

14:24.613 --> 14:25.573
This is kinda cool.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.241
Are you a doctor?

14:27.741 --> 14:29.660
-No.
-Let me buy you a beer.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.497
-I don't drink.
-Really? All right then, hey.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.461
-Okay.
-Hey.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.881
-She doesn't need saving.
-I know.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.382
[male] I just got paid.

14:43.632 --> 14:46.302
My friends are over there. Let's buy you
a drink. It'll be all right.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.096
That was my beer.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.765
Hey babe, what'd I miss?

14:52.516 --> 14:54.101
Hi. Randall Carpio.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.979
-And you are...
-Not buying your boyfriend act.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.981
She just told me she doesn't drink.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.192
[girl] How about you both just
leave me alone and let me finish my work?

15:02.484 --> 15:03.903
Unless one of you knows how to test

15:03.986 --> 15:07.114
pharmacological reaction times
on adverse psychotropic mood elevators.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.036
Oh, I mean, I'll leave that one to you.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.872
You could try a radioactive tag

15:14.997 --> 15:18.375
and check cortex distribution levels
using a PET scan.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.673
-You can stay.
-Yes. Bye!

15:27.384 --> 15:28.218
Bye-bye.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.387
Dick.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.308
-Hi, I'm Randall.
-Hi.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.477
-And you are?
-Ruby.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.396
-It's nice to meet you, Ruby.
-Nice to meet you.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.439
[laughs]

15:42.775 --> 15:43.776
[door clangs]

15:44.151 --> 15:45.319
[Brandon] Oh, shit.

15:46.362 --> 15:50.199
You got called in by the Magus, too?
I legit can't think of what I did wrong.

15:50.824 --> 15:53.577
You're not here to see the Magus.
You're here to see me.

15:54.578 --> 15:57.831
-But I just saw you in chemistry.
-I need help, Brandon.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.460
I need someone I can trust.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.754
You got a kind of an intense vibe
going on.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.255
Are you off gluten again?

16:05.798 --> 16:09.468
Remember when you said you wanted to use
Kyle's death to our advantage?

16:09.551 --> 16:11.595
-Did you get us out of cleaning duties?
-Even better.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.681
But I can't tell you

16:14.306 --> 16:16.725
until you pass a test.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.268
What kind of test?

16:19.269 --> 16:20.104
It's easy.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.272
I ask you questions...

16:25.317 --> 16:26.402
and you tell me the truth.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.153
I always tell you the truth.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.239
Then you have nothing to worry about.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.451
A wire stripper. A wire stripper.

16:34.702 --> 16:35.953
Ah, got ya.

16:38.956 --> 16:39.873
Hey!

16:44.044 --> 16:45.004
What are you doing here?

16:45.087 --> 16:46.714
You have something of mine.
I want it back.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.924
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.551
Don't make me magic it away from you.

16:50.884 --> 16:53.095
Proving you're as evil as I think you are.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.932
If I don't return it, even in pieces,

16:57.558 --> 16:59.059
some people might come looking for it.

16:59.143 --> 17:02.688
And you don't want them finding it
anywhere near you or your grandson.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.606
You want it back?

17:05.649 --> 17:06.900
You wanna keep him safe?

17:07.735 --> 17:09.278
Then I want Jack out of The Order.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.531
-So, tell him yourself.
-I tried that. He won't listen.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.159
Which is why you're gonna convince him.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.911
Once you do, you get your phone back.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.248
You sound like my dad.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.792
Your dad must be a smart man.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.295
So.

17:27.337 --> 17:28.338
We have a deal?

17:29.965 --> 17:31.258
-Deal.
-Good.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.094
Now, get off my land.

17:45.856 --> 17:46.940
There, see?

17:47.357 --> 17:48.609
That wasn't so bad.

17:48.692 --> 17:49.943
[Brandon shivers]

17:50.027 --> 17:52.279
And you? Super-brave.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.490
[Brandon whimpers]

17:55.199 --> 17:56.283
What is that thing?

17:56.742 --> 17:58.160
It's just a glove...

17:59.703 --> 18:01.622
that burns your soul when you lie.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.042
And now,

18:05.501 --> 18:08.462
I know you'll always be honest with me.

18:09.296 --> 18:10.672
What is this for?

18:11.590 --> 18:13.801
We are going to cleanse The Order...

18:15.094 --> 18:18.889
of liars and traitors and werewolves.

18:18.972 --> 18:21.517
-Oh, my.
-And you get to be my assistant.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.393
You're welcome.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.771
It sounds like an inquisition.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.732
And you sound like a man
who's trying to hide something.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.192
Hey, no, no.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.318
We're good.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.821
Whatever you want, you're the man.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.114
[gulps]

18:35.197 --> 18:36.073
The woman.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.283
Yeah, no, I love dogs.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.828
Every time I see a dog, I’m like,
“It's a famous…

18:40.911 --> 18:42.162
-it's like a famous person.”

18:42.246 --> 18:46.208
...that show, but she's in high school,
and her and that guy from that robot show,

18:46.291 --> 18:48.752
they're killing people, but it's funny.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.880
-It doesn't even sound real.
-[Lilith] No, it's real!

18:52.005 --> 18:53.048
I swear!

18:55.008 --> 18:55.843
It was him.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.848
Keep your hands to yourself, bitch.

19:01.682 --> 19:02.808
Oh, I'm the bitch?

19:03.559 --> 19:04.935
You're gonna look real cute

19:05.018 --> 19:08.355
when I turn that wallet chain
into a leash and make you roll over.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.859
[Hamish] Hey. Let's all take a breath.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.403
You know there's only one way
this plays out.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.573
She insults you,
then I try to talk everyone down,

19:17.656 --> 19:19.992
but you get insulted by something I say
and threaten me.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.995
She'll insult you again, and you'll do
something stupid like swing at me.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.705
She punches you, your pals step up,

19:24.788 --> 19:26.915
the whole place jumps off,
and someone calls the cops.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.625
So, what if...

19:29.418 --> 19:30.252
instead of all that,

19:30.919 --> 19:33.672
we buy you guys a round
and call it a night?

19:34.923 --> 19:36.800
Call me stupid again, dumbass.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.095
You know, aggression is a sign
of a micropenis.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.598
[Jack] Did you hear that? Micropenis.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.602
-[whack]
-[cries of shock]

19:47.477 --> 19:49.354
-[crash of glass]
-[Lilith screams]

19:49.438 --> 19:51.356
-[crash]
-[thump]

19:51.440 --> 19:53.108
-[Lilith groans]
-[thwack]

19:53.192 --> 19:56.778
-[groans]
-[thumps]

19:56.862 --> 19:58.405
-[snarls]
-[yells]

19:58.488 --> 20:00.324
-Lilith, no!
-[Lilith snarls]

20:01.658 --> 20:02.743
Well, that's boring!

20:03.577 --> 20:04.828
Aren't those your friends?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.872
You leave 'em alone for five minutes.

20:06.955 --> 20:10.000
-[shouting]
-[smashing of glass]

20:10.375 --> 20:13.045
-You want to get out of here?
-I thought you'd never ask.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.713
[groans]

20:14.796 --> 20:16.632
[smashing of glass]

20:16.715 --> 20:21.053
-[thwacks]
-[groans]

20:21.136 --> 20:24.264
-[groans]
-[roars]

20:27.601 --> 20:29.269
[Lilith roars]

20:29.353 --> 20:31.396
Woo! Day drinking rules!

20:35.150 --> 20:41.990
[ringing sound]

20:42.616 --> 20:43.450
[beep]

20:49.623 --> 20:50.499
Shit.

21:04.012 --> 21:06.640
Who do you think you are,
summoning me, Acolyte?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.851
Okay, first of all,
your hair looks so good today.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.019
I asked you a question.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.272
Selena, you don't ask
the questions anymore.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.816
-That's my job.
-Says who?

21:15.899 --> 21:17.484
Says the Temple Magus.

21:17.901 --> 21:18.777
And me.

21:22.572 --> 21:25.325
-And this.
-You should really sit down.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.038
Tell me about Kyle.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.040
What do you wanna know?

21:32.332 --> 21:34.418
Did you know he was a werewolf
when you guys hooked up?

21:34.960 --> 21:37.212
-Was his junk all weird?
-It was one date.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.756
He felt me up, I lied about my period,
and that was it.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.262
Kyle has a thing for fresh meat.

21:45.345 --> 21:47.931
I'm surprised he didn't take a run at you.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.850
I can be a little intimidating.

21:50.183 --> 21:53.395
You wanna know about Kyle? I'm not
the person you should be talking to.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.647
So, give me a name.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.616
-You wanted to talk?
-I do.

22:08.577 --> 22:09.661
It's a little early.

22:10.537 --> 22:11.872
Not that I'm complaining.

22:11.955 --> 22:14.082
Well, now it's a breakfast drink.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.459
Do you have glasses?

22:20.839 --> 22:22.382
[Edward] Veritas.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.259
The goddess of truth.

22:25.844 --> 22:26.928
Seriously?

22:27.179 --> 22:28.847
You want my support?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.058
Then, you will take your medicine

22:31.516 --> 22:34.853
and give me a few hours of honesty.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.606
At least you didn't bring that damn glove.

22:37.689 --> 22:38.523
Mm.

22:38.732 --> 22:39.566
[pop]

22:54.498 --> 22:56.541
Here. This won't hurt a bit.

22:57.709 --> 22:58.543
Oh, I will...

22:59.669 --> 23:00.545
if you will.

23:01.254 --> 23:02.214
It's only fair.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.065
Mm.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.401
Told you it wouldn't hurt.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.739
In my experience, the truth always hurts.

23:31.284 --> 23:32.119
[Edward] So.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.622
What should we talk about?

23:37.582 --> 23:38.458
[Jack] Alyssa!

23:39.167 --> 23:40.043
Alyssa!

23:40.252 --> 23:41.753
Listen, about last night.

23:41.837 --> 23:45.340
I'm really sorry for texting you so much.

23:45.715 --> 23:47.843
-I was drunk.
-No, really?

23:48.677 --> 23:49.678
It was that obvious?

23:50.220 --> 23:52.222
I think my favorite was a pizza emoji

23:52.305 --> 23:55.392
followed by a ghost emoji
followed by an eggplant emoji.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.477
-What does that even mean?
-[phone beeps]

23:57.561 --> 23:59.187
Don't text me anymore.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.065
I won't. I promise.
I just, I wanted to ask if you--

24:02.274 --> 24:03.275
If I what?

24:03.358 --> 24:04.568
[phone beeps]

24:04.651 --> 24:05.944
I assume you didn't...

24:06.611 --> 24:09.823
tell anyone about what happened
with the Necrophone or what I am.

24:11.700 --> 24:15.245
No. I lied to the Grand Magus for you.

24:15.495 --> 24:17.789
-So... thank you for that.
-[phone beeps]

24:18.039 --> 24:18.999
I'm a liar.

24:19.082 --> 24:20.459
[phone keeps beeping]

24:20.542 --> 24:23.378
You see how annoying that is?
I got that all last night.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.754
Alyssa, I'm sorry you had to lie,

24:24.838 --> 24:27.799
but if keeping my secret is too much
of a burden, then don't do it.

24:27.883 --> 24:28.717
I have to, Jack,

24:28.800 --> 24:30.552
-Because I don't want you dead.
-[phone beeps]

24:30.635 --> 24:33.096
-I'm not a monster.
-Hey, neither am I, honest.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.599
All the people that I've killed
have either been accidents

24:35.682 --> 24:37.017
-or to protect you.
-Accidents?

24:37.642 --> 24:39.936
Plural? How many are we talking here?

24:40.020 --> 24:42.272
Technically, I didn't even kill them,
it was Silverback.

24:42.355 --> 24:43.398
Who's Silverback?

24:43.482 --> 24:45.984
It's the name of the werewolf
that I turn into.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.819
-[cellphone rings]
-[Jack stops call]

24:50.113 --> 24:50.947
Jack...

24:52.157 --> 24:53.200
I'm worried about you.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.453
It's like watching someone be torn in two.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.831
I thought it would look like
really well-executed multi-tasking.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.416
You need to figure out who you are.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.418
Maybe The Order isn't right for you.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.921
You sound like my grandfather.

25:06.004 --> 25:08.507
[cellphone rings]

25:08.590 --> 25:09.508
Just answer.

25:10.133 --> 25:11.927
-It doesn't matter.
-It does matter.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.137
[cellphone rings]

25:14.596 --> 25:15.555
Hamish.

25:16.806 --> 25:18.850
Randall? Not since last night.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.187
I'll be right there.

25:30.862 --> 25:32.781
-Anything from Randall?
-Nothing.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.534
None of the bar staff remember
seeing him after the fight.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.328
-What about that girl he was with?
-No one knows her.

25:38.453 --> 25:39.913
Did you try his phone?

25:40.580 --> 25:42.999
-First thing. No answer.
-Maybe he was asleep.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.794
I suppose your magic phone is gonna work
where mine didn't?

25:46.545 --> 25:53.468
[Randall's ringtone sounds]

25:58.598 --> 26:00.350
I heard the sound of magic this morning.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.143
-Me, too.
-It woke me up.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.604
Lilith and I will check
his usual hangout spots. Jack?

26:04.688 --> 26:07.065
I'll check the temple.
Make sure he's not there.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.363
[door bangs]

26:14.656 --> 26:15.865
[male] Is this gonna take long?

26:16.366 --> 26:18.868
-You have somewhere you'd rather be?
-I'm late for class.

26:18.952 --> 26:23.331
[groans]

26:23.415 --> 26:25.083
You're not being honest with me.

26:26.459 --> 26:28.128
I lined up a Tinder, okay?

26:29.379 --> 26:31.673
[gasps]

26:31.881 --> 26:33.508
What the fuck was that?

26:33.925 --> 26:35.844
Your BFF, Kyle...

26:36.511 --> 26:37.596
was a werewolf.

26:39.306 --> 26:42.142
-And he wasn't the only one.
-All I know is it's not me.

26:46.104 --> 26:48.565
Did you ever see Kyle and Alyssa together?

26:49.190 --> 26:51.526
Of course I did.
They dated for, like, three months.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.194
And did they do anything...

26:53.903 --> 26:54.738
suspicious?

26:54.821 --> 26:58.033
They wore matching sweaters one time.
They said it was an accident,

26:58.116 --> 26:59.492
but I didn't buy it.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.829
-Disgusting.
-But it's not Alyssa.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.414
She's a girl scout cookie.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.088
She let Jack keep his memory.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.591
She wrecked the Elemental Transference.

27:14.924 --> 27:16.801
She screwed up with the necromancers.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.387
Everywhere she goes...

27:19.929 --> 27:22.307
something goes wrong.

27:24.851 --> 27:27.354
Yet, you're sure it's not her?

27:28.730 --> 27:29.814
You'd swear to that?

27:34.486 --> 27:35.737
I'm not sure.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.324
Now, we're getting somewhere.

27:39.783 --> 27:40.992
[Vera] Did you know

27:41.743 --> 27:44.996
that the Vade Maecum Infernal
attracted werewolves?

27:45.497 --> 27:46.373
No.

27:47.207 --> 27:50.460
And boring. That's your big question?

27:50.543 --> 27:52.879
Why don't you ask something exciting?
Like...

27:53.588 --> 27:55.674
have you ever thought
about sleeping with me?

27:55.757 --> 27:58.343
Sleeping, no. Fucking, yes.
Shit.

27:58.426 --> 28:01.721
I have thought about you naked
ten times since you walked in here.

28:01.805 --> 28:04.265
-Stop.
-Actually, eleven now.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.351
-Twelve.
-This is...

28:07.102 --> 28:09.938
not going how I planned. You…

28:10.480 --> 28:12.315
You've always been fascinating like that.

28:12.399 --> 28:15.318
Come on, I'm difficult, I'm driven,
I'm impatient.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.404
I think I'm smarter than everyone else,

28:17.487 --> 28:20.156
which is clearly not the case
since I'm in here doing this.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.908
All I can think is
how I shouldn't tell you

28:21.991 --> 28:24.077
that I'm afraid you might be
pure fucking evil.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.328
-Evil?
-Aha.

28:26.162 --> 28:28.415
-Selfish and dangerous?
-Aha.

28:28.748 --> 28:31.459
You know, when I was younger
and I first had power and money,

28:31.543 --> 28:35.296
I used to use women and betray my friends.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.631
What changed?

28:37.507 --> 28:38.717
I fell in love.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.844
I liked Sophia.

28:40.927 --> 28:43.263
She kept you in line.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.558
Oh, God, you're not bringing her
back to life, are you?

28:46.641 --> 28:48.685
Don't bring her back to life.
That's so messy.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.229
You think that's why
I want the Vade Maecum?

28:51.312 --> 28:52.439
Apparently.

28:53.481 --> 28:54.774
Well, Sophia is dead.

28:54.858 --> 28:57.110
And even though the Vade Maecum could,

28:57.819 --> 28:59.529
no magic could change that.

29:00.864 --> 29:03.158
You'd understand if you ever lost someone.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.201
I had a daughter when I was sixteen.

29:05.326 --> 29:06.828
-Where is she now?
-Dead.

29:07.662 --> 29:09.080
-Then you understand.
-I do.

29:10.123 --> 29:12.292
I'm also thinking
about you naked right now.

29:12.709 --> 29:13.543
Oh!

29:14.085 --> 29:15.879
This stuff is so strong.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.879
Sophia Coventry.

29:57.962 --> 29:59.047
[whoosh]

30:00.799 --> 30:01.883
[Sophia]<i> Who is this?</i>

30:01.966 --> 30:02.842
Sophia...

30:03.885 --> 30:05.303
I need to ask you questions.

30:06.513 --> 30:07.680
About your husband.

30:08.389 --> 30:10.391
<i>Edward? Is that you?</i>

30:11.309 --> 30:12.352
It's someone else.

30:12.977 --> 30:14.813
<i>There's no light. I can't see.</i>

30:15.647 --> 30:17.440
<i>Where's my son? Where's Maddox?</i>

30:17.857 --> 30:19.734
I don't know anything about your son,

30:20.693 --> 30:21.903
except he has a brother.

30:23.404 --> 30:24.405
My grandson.

30:26.241 --> 30:27.867
And your asshole husband...

30:29.244 --> 30:30.411
killed my daughter.

30:30.912 --> 30:33.248
And I'm betting he killed you, too.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.291
<i>I was the price he had to pay.</i>

30:35.834 --> 30:38.336
-So, how do we stop him?
<i>-You can't stop him.</i>

30:39.254 --> 30:40.255
<i>Where's my son?</i>

30:40.672 --> 30:41.923
How do I stop Edward?

30:42.090 --> 30:45.468
<i>He's a good man, but he wants power</i>
<i>more than he wants to be good.</i>

30:45.844 --> 30:47.470
Yeah, I know that already.

30:48.429 --> 30:49.305
Now, listen.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.433
-My boy's in the Order--
<i>-It's too late.</i>

30:53.059 --> 30:54.060
<i>Too late.</i>

30:55.186 --> 30:56.187
We have a plan.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.607
I'm looking for an inside track.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.693
<i>It's The Order, you've already lost.</i>

31:03.278 --> 31:04.904
Lost? What do you mean, lost?

31:05.238 --> 31:07.323
<i>If The Order has him, he belongs to them.</i>

31:09.909 --> 31:11.703
How... How do I stop him?

31:12.245 --> 31:13.454
How do I stop Edward?

31:14.038 --> 31:15.498
How do I save my grandson?

31:15.874 --> 31:17.125
<i>Save my son!</i>

31:17.458 --> 31:19.669
<i>Before it's too late,</i>
<i>before he kills them both.</i>

31:19.752 --> 31:21.880
-[crackling]
-[feedback]

31:39.063 --> 31:39.898
Jack.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.399
You need to stop.

31:41.524 --> 31:44.027
Stalking only works in the movies
and it shouldn't.

31:44.110 --> 31:45.862
This is a coincidence. I promise.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.364
Why are you here?

31:51.200 --> 31:54.037
This is what I'm talking about.
Everything is a secret with you.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.706
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've been summoned, so...

31:56.831 --> 31:58.499
I think The Order took my friend.

31:58.875 --> 32:01.419
I think someone there found out
he's a werewolf, and they have him.

32:04.756 --> 32:05.632
Who is it?

32:09.510 --> 32:10.637
That's what I thought.

32:11.721 --> 32:14.641
It's not The Order and the Knights
that are tearing me apart, it's you.

32:15.475 --> 32:16.392
Look...

32:17.477 --> 32:21.105
you can't see who I really am.
You think I'm some kinda monster.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.107
Well, you are.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.069
Maybe it takes monsters
to police monsters.

32:26.152 --> 32:29.155
You've never even tried to understand
what it is we do here.

32:29.405 --> 32:31.866
You got some vendetta against The Order
which I...

32:32.241 --> 32:35.036
I can't understand because you wanted
so desperately to join it.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.747
I am grateful to The Order
because it brought me to you,

32:37.830 --> 32:39.582
but that does not mean that it's perfect.

32:39.999 --> 32:40.833
I know.

32:41.417 --> 32:42.752
Because it's just people.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.213
So, you can forgive them, but not me.

32:47.882 --> 32:48.841
Just go.

32:50.093 --> 32:52.512
Leave The Order,
be with your little pack. Go...

32:52.971 --> 32:55.723
Go kill people and hurt them and lie.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.183
At least they have my back.

32:57.308 --> 32:59.018
-I saved your life!
-And I saved yours!

32:59.102 --> 33:00.728
I told you to take the Necrophone and go!

33:00.812 --> 33:02.647
-You didn't listen!
-She would have killed you!

33:03.523 --> 33:04.440
Excuse me?

33:05.984 --> 33:08.277
I'm totally sorry to interrupt
this whole drama, but...

33:08.778 --> 33:10.238
you both need to come with me.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.364
Not now, Gabrielle.

33:11.447 --> 33:13.449
-I have the authority to bring you--
-That's enough!

33:13.825 --> 33:16.035
-Now listen, Acolyte.
-No, you listen!

33:16.494 --> 33:18.496
You stuck up, beautiful blonde Medicum!

33:19.247 --> 33:21.582
I am Gabrielle fucking Dupres.

33:22.375 --> 33:26.212
I kill werewolves, punish the guilty,
and I am the law.

33:26.963 --> 33:30.341
So, I'm gonna tell you one last time.
You and your trailer park boyfriend

33:30.466 --> 33:33.636
need to get to the goddamn temple now
before I get mad.

33:47.191 --> 33:48.693
When Maddox was born...

33:50.153 --> 33:52.030
I was terrified.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.241
I hadn't planned on being a father and...

33:55.992 --> 33:59.370
I didn't wanna bring a child
into a world so dark.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.040
What changed your mind?

34:03.583 --> 34:04.834
The Vade Maecum.

34:06.586 --> 34:07.420
Just...

34:08.713 --> 34:10.214
the idea, the...

34:10.840 --> 34:13.509
thought of what this spell
could mean for humanity.

34:13.593 --> 34:14.802
It gave me hope.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.305
We can change the world, we can...

34:17.805 --> 34:19.265
make everything better.

34:20.349 --> 34:21.684
[Vera] Is that why you want it?

34:24.645 --> 34:25.480
No.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.733
Tell me why, truly.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.070
Peanuts.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.699
Sorry, just... did you say peanuts?

34:37.492 --> 34:39.702
Maddox is allergic.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.580
Even the slightest trace could kill him.

34:47.877 --> 34:49.462
Edward, do you believe in fate?

34:49.921 --> 34:51.547
Not usually. Why?

35:05.311 --> 35:07.939
My daughter died of anaphylactic shock
at seven months old.

35:11.317 --> 35:12.318
So, here.

35:13.152 --> 35:15.822
-Let's get those peanut motherfuckers.
-Where did you find this?

35:15.905 --> 35:17.824
A safety deposit box in Washington.

35:20.243 --> 35:23.162
Vera, I could... I could kiss you.

35:23.246 --> 35:24.288
You could.

35:27.750 --> 35:28.709
But we won't.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.592
[Jack] Is it just me, or is this weird?

35:36.676 --> 35:38.386
-[door opens]
-[Alyssa] This is weird.

35:39.178 --> 35:40.805
-[door bangs]
-[Brandon] Silence.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.223
Subservience.

35:44.392 --> 35:45.476
Observance.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.321
[Jack] What is that?

35:57.655 --> 35:58.781
[Brandon] It's called...

35:59.532 --> 36:01.117
"The Glove of Truth."

36:01.868 --> 36:03.661
[Gabby] No, it's not, Brandon.

36:03.744 --> 36:05.830
Just... shut up.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.459
All you need to know

36:11.460 --> 36:15.131
is that if you even think about lying
to me...

36:19.302 --> 36:21.470
this glove will make you wish
you were never born.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.017
Eenie...

36:27.810 --> 36:28.853
meenie...

36:30.396 --> 36:31.606
miny...

36:35.026 --> 36:35.860
moe.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.448
Looks like you're the big winner.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.249
I told you to get your shit together.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.794
You should've listened.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.425
What do you know about werewolves?

37:00.468 --> 37:01.594
Nothing.

37:01.677 --> 37:02.887
[screams]

37:02.970 --> 37:04.096
[male clears throat]

37:04.180 --> 37:05.306
[screams]

37:05.389 --> 37:07.141
I’m sorry,
but that's not what the glove says.

37:07.767 --> 37:10.436
-Gabrielle, listen to me.
-You'll get your turn.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.024
Tell me about Kyle.

37:16.108 --> 37:18.694
-We only dated a few months.
-Gross.

37:20.112 --> 37:22.448
And did you know he was a werewolf
when you dated?

37:22.698 --> 37:23.532
No.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.661
-When did you know?
-When you told me.

37:26.827 --> 37:29.288
And if you'd known he was a werewolf,

37:30.248 --> 37:31.958
would you have said something?

37:32.416 --> 37:33.251
Of course.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.878
[screams]

37:35.962 --> 37:36.796
Let her go!

37:37.296 --> 37:40.216
Looks like we have a werewolf lover
on our hands.

37:40.716 --> 37:41.550
No.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.761
Where were you when I killed Kyle?

37:44.804 --> 37:47.306
-I was on a mission for the Grand Magus.
-We both were.

37:48.349 --> 37:50.017
Why did you sabotage
the transference spell?

37:50.476 --> 37:52.937
It was me. You can ask the Grand Magus.
I already confessed.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.146
You're a werewolf.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.315
-Admit it!
-I'm not! I swear!

37:57.066 --> 37:58.776
-So, tell me who is!
-No!

37:59.068 --> 38:00.903
[screams]

38:00.987 --> 38:02.321
You can't plead the fifth.

38:02.405 --> 38:08.077
[screams]

38:08.160 --> 38:09.078
[snarls]

38:09.328 --> 38:10.913
[roars]

38:10.997 --> 38:12.623
[screams]

38:12.707 --> 38:14.667
-No!
-Who are you trying to protect?

38:14.750 --> 38:15.793
Nobody!

38:15.876 --> 38:18.129
-[Jack groans]
-[steam whistles]

38:18.212 --> 38:19.630
-[Vera] Enough!
-Ah!

38:20.923 --> 38:22.967
Reliquary. Now.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.941
[Gabby]
I was only doing what you asked.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.694
And Morton is hiding something.

38:41.777 --> 38:43.362
-You let her do this?
-Jack.

38:43.446 --> 38:45.156
That is seriously fucked up!

38:45.614 --> 38:47.658
Watch your tone, Mr. Morton.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.118
Watch my tone.

38:50.995 --> 38:53.497
I fought so hard to get here.

38:54.123 --> 38:56.792
With you. Because I believed in The Order.

38:56.959 --> 38:58.544
I thought you were all about loyalty,

38:58.627 --> 39:01.547
but instead you turn on each other
in times of fear.

39:02.173 --> 39:06.635
If that nightmare out there is how
you protect this Order, then... I'm out.

39:09.013 --> 39:09.847
Me, too.

39:11.223 --> 39:13.267
-Brandon!
-This is messed up.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.394
And you're kinda being a bitch right now.

39:16.979 --> 39:19.023
-Shut it down, Acolyte.
-But...

39:19.815 --> 39:20.900
But the werewolf.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.235
You know, Mr. Morton is right.

39:24.737 --> 39:25.571
[clank]

39:25.654 --> 39:26.947
We are better than this.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.534
[door opens]

39:47.301 --> 39:48.260
Where does it hurt?

39:51.097 --> 39:52.556
Pretty much everywhere.

39:54.225 --> 39:55.518
How did you stand that?

39:57.061 --> 39:57.978
Werewolf.

39:59.355 --> 40:00.481
Must be nice.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.568
You didn't have to protect me.

40:06.529 --> 40:08.114
You didn't have to save me.

40:10.950 --> 40:13.327
I would go through hell for you.

40:15.955 --> 40:16.914
You shouldn't.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.417
Can't help it.

40:22.211 --> 40:23.963
How can you be the best person we've got,

40:24.046 --> 40:26.090
and the person who wants
to tear it all down?

40:27.675 --> 40:29.593
I don't know
if I'm either of those people.

40:30.177 --> 40:31.762
[Alyssa] You need to choose a side.

40:33.013 --> 40:34.140
What if I can't?

40:40.104 --> 40:41.730
I don't know how to be with you.

40:45.401 --> 40:46.402
But you wanna be?

41:17.850 --> 41:18.851
Hey, champ.

41:19.393 --> 41:20.269
What's up?

41:20.561 --> 41:22.062
Made a snack. Want some?

41:23.522 --> 41:25.483
-What is it?
-Peanut butter and jam.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.985
-Chunky?
-Of course.

41:30.404 --> 41:31.238
What's that?

41:32.781 --> 41:35.075
This is a magical charm

41:36.160 --> 41:40.789
and it lets you tell people
exactly what they wanna hear.

41:43.834 --> 41:44.793
For real?

41:45.002 --> 41:46.045
Would I lie to you?

41:58.682 --> 41:59.767
I can't do this.

42:00.768 --> 42:04.355
Lil, we have to. He's not in the gym,
he's not in class, he's nowhere.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.274
It doesn't mean that he's dead.

42:07.608 --> 42:09.735
-Doesn't mean that his hide came home.
-I know.

42:10.027 --> 42:11.195
So, let's be sure.

42:14.198 --> 42:16.200
-[Hamish sighs]
-[locks click]

42:21.330 --> 42:22.164
Nothing.

42:23.457 --> 42:24.291
[sighs]

42:25.167 --> 42:26.001
Okay.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.088
So, then where is he?

42:41.850 --> 42:42.851
Hello?

42:43.686 --> 42:45.104
Can anyone hear me?

42:48.399 --> 42:50.442
I think there's been a mistake!

42:50.943 --> 42:55.364
This door won't open,
and I am very hungover!

42:57.366 --> 42:58.617
[bangs on door]

42:58.701 --> 43:00.035
Hello?

43:10.296 --> 43:11.213
[bang]

43:13.007 --> 43:14.842
[loud bangs]

43:14.925 --> 43:15.759
Hey!

43:17.553 --> 43:18.470
Hello!

43:25.686 --> 43:26.854
Okay, okay.

43:27.354 --> 43:28.230
<i>Okay.</i>

43:28.564 --> 43:29.481
<i>Okay.</i>

43:30.816 --> 43:31.692
<i>Okay.</i>

43:33.193 --> 43:34.361
[snarls]

43:35.070 --> 43:37.406
-[snarls]
-[crashes on door]

43:39.241 --> 43:40.534

43:40.618 --> 43:41.869
-[bang]
-Hey!

43:42.745 --> 43:44.788
Doc, what is that?

43:47.541 --> 43:49.001
It's a werewolf.

43:50.002 --> 43:51.795
[assistant] Ah, jeez.

43:51.879 --> 43:53.130
[Randall bangs on door]

43:53.213 --> 43:54.798
[assistant] What are you gonna do?

43:54.923 --> 43:56.884
[doctor]
I'm gonna figure out how to make more.
