00:01.827 --> 00:04.560
Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:04.585 --> 00:06.037
The wedding is in two weeks!

00:06.038 --> 00:07.071
I had sex with Tanya.

00:07.072 --> 00:09.600
You don't live here anymore.

00:09.625 --> 00:11.609
Please give me another chance.

00:11.634 --> 00:13.038
You need to earn back my trust.

00:13.039 --> 00:15.007
I'm ready to do the work.

00:15.008 --> 00:16.553
Oh, watching you and Madison together,

00:16.578 --> 00:18.028
I had a big breakthrough.

00:18.029 --> 00:19.054
We should have a baby.

00:20.058 --> 00:21.999
- We should have sex.
- What?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.058
I know. I'm shocked, too.

00:23.059 --> 00:24.835
Rebecca Bunch's past, please.

00:24.860 --> 00:26.017
Here you go.

00:26.018 --> 00:28.249
You just called me Robert.

00:29.025 --> 00:30.058
Being a priest is dope.

00:30.059 --> 00:33.000
Did Jesus ever give
you any reason to, like,

00:33.437 --> 00:35.057
- have doubts?
- No.

00:35.058 --> 00:37.041
I have questions about Rebecca,

00:37.042 --> 00:38.075
and I don't know if
they're real questions

00:38.076 --> 00:40.066
or if I have the jitters.

00:40.067 --> 00:41.067
So find Rebecca.

00:41.068 --> 00:42.690
Ask her your questions.

00:42.715 --> 00:45.078
And Eagle is gone.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.032
Josh is leaving me

00:47.033 --> 00:48.917
to become a priest?

00:48.942 --> 00:51.016
Rebecca! Stop!

00:51.017 --> 00:53.190
Josh Chan must be destroyed.

- Maya!

01:17.805 --> 01:18.805
Don't yell at me.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.844
I haven't asked about her today yet.

01:21.118 --> 01:23.135
Read the sign with me, Maya.

01:25.429 --> 01:27.066
"I don't know where Rebecca is.

01:27.067 --> 01:29.341
"Stop asking me.

01:29.366 --> 01:32.037
"After we agreed to destroy Josh Chan,

01:32.038 --> 01:34.066
"Rebecca excused herself to pee

01:34.067 --> 01:37.037
"and I haven't heard from her since.

01:37.038 --> 01:39.061
"I do know she's alive

01:39.062 --> 01:42.091
"because she liked my
Ice Bucket Challenge video

01:42.092 --> 01:44.597
from three years ago."

01:44.622 --> 01:46.057
I know, but, Paula,
that sign really skimps

01:46.058 --> 01:48.003
on her interiority.

01:48.004 --> 01:49.294
And we all have so many questions.

01:49.319 --> 01:50.332
It's been two weeks.

01:50.357 --> 01:52.007
Was there somebody else?

01:52.008 --> 01:53.071
Is Josh really becoming a priest?

01:53.072 --> 01:55.053
Why didn't that bitch
invite me to the wedding?

01:55.054 --> 01:58.347
Enough! I wish I had
answers, but I don't!

01:58.372 --> 02:02.207
I don't know where she is!

02:03.833 --> 02:04.871
Go!

02:04.896 --> 02:06.763

just a couple of days

to process everything.

06:19.831 --> 06:21.393
Poor thing, she has
been through so much.

Yeah, not everyone can

06:25.037 --> 06:26.405
We're getting a second chance

06:26.406 --> 06:29.185
after my... horrible mistake, thank God.

06:29.210 --> 06:31.677
Yeah, we are. And I have to thank you.

06:31.702 --> 06:33.390
You've been just so great

06:33.415 --> 06:36.367
about all these rules
and... Oh, by the way,

06:36.368 --> 06:37.414
did you remember to sign in last night?

06:37.415 --> 06:39.350
Because I was so busy I forgot to check.

06:39.351 --> 06:41.097
Come on. Of course I did.

06:41.122 --> 06:43.784
- I want to restore our marital trust.
- _

06:43.809 --> 06:47.390
Ooh, who signed in early
every day this week?

06:47.415 --> 06:49.214
Good job.

06:49.334 --> 06:51.558
Thanks. I'm excited
about this rule here.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.418
"Scott sleeps on the
couch until he passes

06:53.419 --> 06:55.367
the lie-detector test three times."

06:55.368 --> 06:56.389
I've only got one test left,

06:56.390 --> 06:57.972
and back in the bed.

06:58.372 --> 07:00.333
Yep. Uh-huh.

07:00.334 --> 07:03.171
Yep. But, you know what?
First you have to pass it.

07:03.196 --> 07:06.385
And the questions are, like, no joke

07:06.432 --> 07:08.092
on the last test... just a heads-up.

07:08.117 --> 07:11.078
- I'm ready.
- Okay, I am just...

07:11.132 --> 07:12.389
I'm just checking.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.796
You're-you're okay, you're
fine with all this, right?

07:14.821 --> 07:17.491
- Are you kidding? Yes.
- Right.

07:17.516 --> 07:19.536
Our plan gets rid of all the guilt.

07:19.561 --> 07:22.507
It spells it all out. No confusion.

07:23.749 --> 07:25.382
I'm so confused.

07:25.407 --> 07:26.764
Who called this meeting again?

07:26.765 --> 07:28.713
I don't know, I just got an anonymous

07:28.714 --> 07:29.744
Google Calendar invite.

07:29.745 --> 07:31.751
Okay, who is wasting my
time with a stupid meeting?

07:31.752 --> 07:33.718
Hmm? And what was up
with the subject line...

07:33.719 --> 07:34.769
"Insidious Business"?

07:34.770 --> 07:36.298
- Is this you, Darryl?
- Hmm?

07:36.323 --> 07:38.447
It makes so little sense,
it seems like a you thing.

07:38.472 --> 07:39.726
- Does it?
- Mm-hmm.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.769
I have a "me" thing?

07:40.770 --> 07:42.739
What are some of my other "me" things?

07:42.740 --> 07:44.722
Asking a lot of questions,
is that a "me" thing?

07:44.723 --> 07:47.705
Wait, so nobody knows what this is?

07:47.706 --> 07:49.730
- Mm-mm.
- Yeah, okay, I'm out of here.

07:49.731 --> 07:51.475
Not so fast, mama.

07:56.748 --> 07:58.790
What?

08:04.088 --> 08:06.108
Wow.

08:08.287 --> 08:10.743
I know, my hair is dark, so I look evil,

08:10.744 --> 08:12.990
but I'm wearing white, which is ironic.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.434
That's not why we're surprised.

08:15.435 --> 08:17.282
Okay, we haven't seen you in two weeks,

08:17.307 --> 08:19.897
and suddenly you're spinning
around in some big chair?

08:20.296 --> 08:22.349
Okay, yes, that's also surprising.

08:22.350 --> 08:24.295
I'm so glad you're all right.

08:24.296 --> 08:25.655
Paula, Paula, I'm trying to do a thing.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.233
Oh, sorry, honey. I'm watching.

08:27.258 --> 08:28.764
Do you want to turn around again?

08:28.789 --> 08:30.655
- No. Why would I...
- Okay. Okay.

08:30.991 --> 08:32.015
How long have you been here?

08:32.322 --> 08:33.663
Oh, since 5:00 a.m.

08:33.688 --> 08:35.666
I had to get here early
for the big reveal.

08:35.691 --> 08:38.522
Brought my own chair, hope you like it.
But I'm not tired.

08:38.547 --> 08:40.595
I've been catnapping.

08:41.380 --> 08:42.818
So...

08:45.382 --> 08:48.007
you've all been
wondering where I've been.

08:48.032 --> 08:51.052
Oh, yes, I saw the
locally trending hashtag.

08:51.350 --> 08:53.741
Well, the answer is

08:53.766 --> 08:57.866
I've been going through
a metamorphosis of sorts.

08:58.278 --> 09:00.202
I have emerged...

09:00.258 --> 09:01.325
Ooh... from the cocoon

09:01.326 --> 09:02.928
of female submission

09:02.953 --> 09:06.757
as a scorned butterfly, dagger in hand.

09:06.782 --> 09:08.756
Okay, you know what? Show's over.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.522
Kids, let's get back to work, hmm?

09:10.547 --> 09:12.731
Miss Bunch, can I
speak with you, please?

09:12.756 --> 09:15.272
Um, I'm actually in the next meeting.
I have an alert...

09:15.297 --> 09:17.748
When will you start acting
like you work for me? Hmm?

09:17.960 --> 09:21.769
- Go, go, go, let's go.
- Okay, all right, okay.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.744
Go, go!

09:26.355 --> 09:29.171
I know that you've had a tough time.

09:29.196 --> 09:30.724
- Hmm?
- Um, but that doesn't mean

09:30.749 --> 09:32.585
that you cannot answer calls

09:32.610 --> 09:34.596
or texts or e-mails.

09:34.621 --> 09:37.857
Or write a thank-you note for a basket

09:37.882 --> 09:39.786
of soothing bath salts
and artisanal pears

09:39.811 --> 09:41.751
that I might have
dropped off at your door.

09:41.752 --> 09:42.815
Oh, my God, Nathaniel.

09:43.073 --> 09:45.507
Did you send me a bunch
of weird, girly crap?

09:46.769 --> 09:48.780
You were worried about me.

09:48.781 --> 09:50.722
Oh, boop!

09:50.723 --> 09:52.801
That's adorable. You're adorable.

09:52.802 --> 09:54.734
I mean, it's kind of sad and unsexy,

09:54.735 --> 09:55.752
but you're adorable.

09:55.753 --> 09:58.061
You are, um...

10:00.628 --> 10:01.784
very different.

10:01.785 --> 10:04.734
I am. Oh, I am.

10:04.735 --> 10:05.785
I am invincible.

10:05.786 --> 10:07.777
There's a flame burning around me.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.784
Uh-huh.

10:10.785 --> 10:12.772
Now, I booked this room
for the next meeting,

10:12.773 --> 10:14.173
so get out of here.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.886
Uh, for which case?

10:18.359 --> 10:20.636
The most important case of my life.

10:21.385 --> 10:23.396
Now, seriously, get out of here.

10:23.553 --> 10:26.198
But, um, walk slowly.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.387
I want to watch those pants move.

10:41.526 --> 10:44.693
I've never gotten a
Google Cal invite before.

10:44.802 --> 10:46.417
Where did you get those clothes?

10:46.442 --> 10:48.802
Off a scarecrow, so... You look nice.

10:48.803 --> 10:50.986
Thanks. I have a meeting

10:51.011 --> 10:53.487
with a bride and groom
to plan their wedding.

10:53.512 --> 10:55.072
They're from Calabasas.
I think they're loaded.

10:55.097 --> 10:58.144
Cool. I can't wait to hear how
we're gonna get back at Josh.

10:58.169 --> 10:59.819
Rebecca said she had the perfect plan.

10:59.820 --> 11:02.760
You know, I was worried about
her, but she looks dynamite,

11:02.761 --> 11:03.777
and she seems very focused.

11:03.778 --> 11:05.793
Great. I love drama...

11:08.019 --> 11:10.130
- Mm.
- Oh!

11:10.155 --> 11:13.333
Look at you! Someone
call the fire department.

11:13.358 --> 11:14.757
Get it, girl!

11:14.782 --> 11:16.497
She fine!

11:16.522 --> 11:18.810
What else can we say
that we don't usually say?

11:18.811 --> 11:21.536
Oh. Hello. Hello. Thank
you for meeting me here.

11:21.561 --> 11:22.802
I'm sure you've been confused

11:22.803 --> 11:24.780
about what's happening, so, to recap:

11:24.781 --> 11:27.760
After the wedding, was
I thrown for a loop? Yes.

11:27.761 --> 11:28.889
Yes, of course I was.

11:28.914 --> 11:31.614
Did I question the nature
of not only my own existence,

11:31.639 --> 11:32.789
but existence itself?

11:33.241 --> 11:34.256
Yes, of course.

11:34.257 --> 11:35.269
So? So.

11:35.270 --> 11:36.266
Mm.

11:36.267 --> 11:38.244
I went on a retreat,

11:38.245 --> 11:41.959
and I took some time to blue
sky, workshop, ideate and,

11:41.984 --> 11:43.223
most importantly,

11:43.224 --> 11:44.270
transform.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.381
And I formulated a plan.

11:47.406 --> 11:51.084
A plan to destroy Josh Chan.

11:51.775 --> 11:53.788
The Chan Plan, as it were.

11:55.068 --> 11:57.185
Ooh. Hmm.

11:57.186 --> 11:58.779
Wow. Right? It's so cool. Okay. So.

11:58.804 --> 12:00.045
First, I asked myself,

12:00.070 --> 12:01.310
what type of revenge,

12:01.335 --> 12:02.646
or as the French say, révenge...

12:02.671 --> 12:05.130
Actually, the French don't say that,
the word for revenge is vengeance,

12:05.155 --> 12:06.266
but that sounds like
a cheese or something.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.227
So anyway, what type of révenge

12:08.228 --> 12:10.248
are we seeking? And the answer to that

12:10.249 --> 12:11.848
is something tactile,
something visceral.

12:11.873 --> 12:16.934
Something that says "I matter,
and you, Josh Chan, do not."

12:17.184 --> 12:19.228
And I have just the thing.

12:19.229 --> 12:20.809
Ooh, this sounds delicious.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.783
Oh, can you not use
"delicious" in that way?

12:22.808 --> 12:24.852
It creeps me out; it feels
like someone just licked me.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.582
Just tell us your idea, I'm so excited.

12:26.607 --> 12:31.215
My révenge is deceptively
simple and devious.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.220
It's a tactic that has been
used by victims of injustice

12:34.245 --> 12:35.660
throughout human history.

12:35.685 --> 12:36.735
Mm.

12:36.760 --> 12:40.270
I'm speaking, of course, of coprophagia.

12:43.176 --> 12:45.945
It's poop. It's poop stuff.
Yeah.

12:46.846 --> 12:49.861
- What?
- I'm gonna mail him my poop,

12:49.886 --> 12:52.574
but tell him it's cupcakes.

12:55.228 --> 12:56.910
What is that smell?

12:56.935 --> 12:58.951
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, okay.
So, most protein bars

12:58.976 --> 13:00.582
are just candy-coated sugar.

13:00.607 --> 13:01.778
But these bars are different.

13:01.803 --> 13:04.157
These bars contain

13:04.182 --> 13:06.235
the purest, the most powerful form

13:06.236 --> 13:07.836
of protein on Earth.

13:08.586 --> 13:10.633
- Ant protein.
- Is that true?

13:10.658 --> 13:12.555
I have no idea. But I do know

13:12.580 --> 13:14.821
that ants are strong as hell.
Anyway, okay.

13:14.846 --> 13:16.500
Give it a try. I want your notes,

13:16.525 --> 13:18.610
I want your honest
opinion. Give it to me.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.094
Mm.

13:22.119 --> 13:23.508
- No, I like it.
- Yeah?

13:23.548 --> 13:25.297
Yeah, I mean, I'm definitely
getting the ants.

13:25.322 --> 13:28.461
- Okay.
- But I'm also getting caraway.

13:28.486 --> 13:29.899
- Uh-huh.
- And date.

13:29.924 --> 13:32.796
- Yeah
- Oh. Holy hell, here comes the cinnamon

13:32.821 --> 13:34.529
- Mm.
- It's good?

13:34.530 --> 13:35.960
- Oh, yeah.
- You like it?

13:35.985 --> 13:37.005
Oh, it's amazing.

13:37.006 --> 13:38.980
All right. I don't have
a name yet, but I, uh...

13:38.981 --> 13:41.013
I think after two years, I've
finally nailed the recipe.

13:41.014 --> 13:43.618
It's amazing. I am
so proud of you, baby.

13:43.643 --> 13:46.013
You are taking this idea
from conception to birth

13:46.014 --> 13:47.031
through childhood,

13:47.032 --> 13:49.219
to a really moving
high school graduation,

13:49.244 --> 13:52.314
where it makes a speech
about its two cool dads.

13:52.643 --> 13:54.266
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

13:54.291 --> 13:56.602
Darryl, there is nothing I can say

13:56.627 --> 13:58.989
that you can't turn into
a parenting metaphor.

13:59.014 --> 14:00.899
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.940
It just pops out of me headfirst.

14:03.031 --> 14:04.586
Oh, my God. Sorry.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.022
I can't talk about this anymore.

14:06.023 --> 14:07.657
We have talked birth to death.

14:07.968 --> 14:09.039
Look, you're right.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.870
You're right, you're right,
you're right, you're right. Okay?

14:11.895 --> 14:13.415
Maybe we need help.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.035
Maybe we need to see a therapist.

14:15.036 --> 14:17.633
Or, you could, um, just stop it?

14:17.658 --> 14:20.102
If you don't think that
therapists are "cool,"

14:20.127 --> 14:22.147
maybe we could do something
a little more current.

14:22.366 --> 14:25.649
You know? Maybe we could go
see a life coach or a psychic.

14:25.674 --> 14:27.680
Or an essential oil specialist.

14:28.645 --> 14:30.149
Okay, none of those are things.

14:30.174 --> 14:32.014
Tell that to my Reiki practitioner,

14:32.015 --> 14:34.540
who figured out that I
have a ghost in my foot.

14:34.565 --> 14:36.015
Okay, Darryl, right now,

14:36.040 --> 14:38.282
my life is about getting
people to eat these dead ants.

14:38.307 --> 14:39.560
Once that happens, then maybe

14:39.585 --> 14:42.584
we can... start talking about
other stuff.

14:46.521 --> 14:48.021
Don't you ladies get
it? So I'm gonna write

14:48.022 --> 14:49.039
on the package,

14:49.040 --> 14:51.025
"Delicious cupcakes inside,

14:51.292 --> 14:53.607
do not smell before eating."

14:55.114 --> 14:58.177
He will be forced to unwittingly eat...

14:58.202 --> 14:59.986
Okay, you have to, you have to stop.

15:00.011 --> 15:02.662
You said you had, like, a whole plan.

15:02.687 --> 15:04.381
Is the poop thing step one?

15:04.406 --> 15:06.010
Like, he accidentally

15:06.011 --> 15:08.038
eats the poop and then takes a step back

15:08.039 --> 15:09.988
and falls down a flight of stairs,

15:09.989 --> 15:12.025
and there's a dead body there,
and he thinks he killed it,

15:12.026 --> 15:13.975
and we plant the evidence.

15:13.976 --> 15:15.271
That's good. That's very good.

15:15.296 --> 15:16.185
Yes. Thank you.

15:16.210 --> 15:18.985
No. You've got... wow, wow, you
guys are way overthinking this.

15:19.010 --> 15:20.026
Okay, so...

15:21.943 --> 15:23.005
The root of this idea

15:23.006 --> 15:25.677
is I have figurative crap
on my face, and he's crap.

15:26.048 --> 15:27.388
So he deserves to eat it.

15:27.610 --> 15:29.642
You mean, like, metaphorically.

15:29.667 --> 15:30.810
Oh. Yeah.

15:30.835 --> 15:32.521
No! No. No...

15:32.546 --> 15:33.904
no, like, literally.

15:33.929 --> 15:35.956
It's like, "Eat my cupcakes, Josh Chan,

15:35.981 --> 15:37.923
like the piece of crap you are."

15:39.318 --> 15:41.721
Y-Yes, right? Yes... do you get...

15:41.746 --> 15:43.279
do you get it now? Do you get it?

15:43.304 --> 15:45.007
You know I love that idea.

15:45.032 --> 15:45.998
I love it.

15:46.023 --> 15:47.998
But maybe we just, I don't know,

15:48.023 --> 15:49.295
toss around some other ideas.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.693
There's got to be something else

15:50.718 --> 15:53.818
in that... very big brain of yours.

15:53.843 --> 15:55.829
Oh, wow, I wasn't prepared with...

15:55.854 --> 15:58.513
I mean, I have other ideas...
that one's my favorite... but...

15:58.538 --> 16:00.457
I mean, I don't know if I want to share

16:00.482 --> 16:01.849
any more ideas with you guys.

16:01.874 --> 16:03.591
Like, this doesn't feel
like a safe space anymore.

16:03.616 --> 16:04.732
It just feels like, you know,

16:04.757 --> 16:06.743
you haven't even heard my first idea.

16:06.768 --> 16:08.154
Oh, no, we heard it.

16:08.170 --> 16:12.442
- But we just didn't like it.
- See? See? You see?

16:12.467 --> 16:13.855
You're just against anything that I...

16:13.856 --> 16:17.638
- I-I pitch right now.
- Ooh, okay, okay. No, no, no.

16:17.663 --> 16:20.741
No. That's... listen,
just tell us your idea,

16:20.766 --> 16:23.302
and we, we will love it.

16:23.521 --> 16:24.526
Right?

16:24.841 --> 16:25.966
We promise.

16:28.873 --> 16:31.146
Okay. Okay, okay.

16:31.171 --> 16:32.318
So this next idea

16:32.343 --> 16:33.916
is actually better than the first, so:

16:34.552 --> 16:39.497
it's sexy, it's
dangerous, it's click-bait.

16:39.522 --> 16:40.593
Ooh.

16:40.669 --> 16:42.680
Hello, is this Casting Call Magazine?

16:42.908 --> 16:44.907
Yes, I'd like to place an ad.

16:44.940 --> 16:46.939
I'm a producer/writer/director.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.864
And I'm looking to cast someone

16:48.865 --> 16:51.287
who looks exactly like my ex-fiancé.

16:51.312 --> 16:53.852
No, it's not for a TV or film,

16:53.877 --> 16:54.894
it's for something better.

16:54.895 --> 16:56.607
Confidentially,

16:57.539 --> 16:59.890
I'm going to be making a fake sex tape

16:59.915 --> 17:02.918
in which my ex-fiancé appears
to be say he hates Jesus,

17:02.919 --> 17:04.859
ruining his reputation

17:04.861 --> 17:05.940
and making everyone hate him
because he left me at the altar

17:05.941 --> 17:07.316
to become a priest.

17:07.340 --> 17:08.519
Great idea, right?

17:09.835 --> 17:11.175
Le révenge!

17:13.659 --> 17:14.902
What does he look like?

17:14.903 --> 17:16.914
Yes, he is Filipino, about five-eight,

17:16.915 --> 17:19.659
but I will take any Asian you have.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.416
So you guys are making a porno?

17:25.442 --> 17:28.330
No, no. It is a fake sex tape.

17:28.356 --> 17:31.191
Okay? She's getting a fake Josh,
they're gonna have fake sex,

17:31.216 --> 17:33.691
and then, he's gonna fakely
say that he hates Jesus.

17:33.716 --> 17:35.724
Wow. Horrible idea.

17:36.277 --> 17:37.894
But... how would that even work?

17:37.910 --> 17:41.589
Uh, it wouldn't, because it
is the worst idea of all time.

17:41.614 --> 17:42.857
Her other ideas, though,

17:42.882 --> 17:44.745
they were even worse,
if you could believe it.

17:44.927 --> 17:46.893
They were literally crap.

17:47.323 --> 17:49.230
She's not thinking straight.

17:49.255 --> 17:50.756
So we all decided,

17:50.781 --> 17:53.420
let's humor her, let her
get it out of her system,

17:53.445 --> 17:56.919
metabolize these emotions
while yelling at a fake Josh.

17:56.944 --> 17:59.795
- While she's doing fake Josh?
- No! Oh.

17:59.820 --> 18:01.914
- No.
- No, it will never get that far.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.897
Once she realizes how
ridiculous the whole thing is,

18:04.898 --> 18:06.433
she will not go through with it.

18:06.458 --> 18:10.872
This will stop well short of any sex,
real or fake.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.910
Speaking of sex, let's,
uh, strap this thing on, eh?

18:15.285 --> 18:16.851
I can't wait

18:16.852 --> 18:17.931
to pass this test.

18:17.932 --> 18:22.315
Then we're back to
being a real married couple,

18:22.340 --> 18:24.868
sleeping in the same bed.

18:24.869 --> 18:26.244
Not so fast, buster.

18:26.269 --> 18:27.901
The third round is the most intense.

18:27.902 --> 18:30.860
I call it "The Ring of Fire."

18:32.605 --> 18:33.872
All right.

18:36.170 --> 18:38.140
Let's begin.

18:40.354 --> 18:42.922
Have you seen Tanya since the incident?

18:42.923 --> 18:44.221
Yes, at work.

18:46.890 --> 18:47.923
Do you talk to Tanya?

18:47.924 --> 18:49.889
Occasionally, if the work requires, I...

18:49.890 --> 18:51.872
- Yes or no?
- The-the answer's yes,

18:51.873 --> 18:53.682
I have to sometimes.

18:54.620 --> 18:56.335
When you talk to her,

18:56.360 --> 18:58.375
do you flirt?

18:59.637 --> 19:00.918
Do you touch her arm?

19:00.919 --> 19:02.884
Does she giggle?

19:02.885 --> 19:04.909
Does she wear that back support
brace that pushes up her boobs?

19:04.910 --> 19:05.944
Does she shake her tail feather for you?

19:05.945 --> 19:07.926
- I... I-I...
- Answer the questions, buster.

19:07.927 --> 19:10.588
The answers are no, no,

19:10.613 --> 19:13.637
sometimes, but I'm very funny.

19:13.662 --> 19:17.188
Uh, um, yes, but only
because of her scoliosis,

19:17.213 --> 19:19.246
and... what's a tail feather?

19:25.520 --> 19:29.876
Do you find Tanya attractive?

19:30.829 --> 19:32.237
Um...

19:35.432 --> 19:38.868
Yes? I guess I do?

19:38.869 --> 19:40.880
I-I did the thing with her.

19:40.881 --> 19:41.926
- More attractive than me?
- No.

19:41.927 --> 19:43.120
- Do you love Tanya?
- No.

19:43.145 --> 19:45.123
- Are you lying?
- You tell me.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.057
Well, it looks like...

19:56.625 --> 19:58.487
you passed.

19:59.268 --> 20:00.860
Oh, my God.

20:00.885 --> 20:01.964
Great.

20:01.989 --> 20:04.175
Uh...

20:05.112 --> 20:07.905
Can I move my eye mask and
pajama boxers back into the bed?

20:08.542 --> 20:11.667
That is what the contract
says, so I guess so.

20:13.881 --> 20:16.526
- And maybe tonight we, uh...
- Oh, my God, look at the time.

20:16.551 --> 20:17.944
I have auditions for the porno.

20:17.945 --> 20:19.909
Uh, the-the sex tape.

20:19.910 --> 20:21.855
The fake sex tape,

20:21.856 --> 20:23.918
that I... is never gonna happen.

20:23.919 --> 20:25.939
Okay. Uh...

20:25.940 --> 20:27.859
Bye!

20:27.860 --> 20:29.167
Next.

20:29.192 --> 20:30.644
I hate Jesus!

20:30.669 --> 20:32.903
No, no, no, you're doing it wrong.

20:32.928 --> 20:34.370
Okay.

20:34.395 --> 20:36.402
So the point of this scene,

20:36.465 --> 20:37.899
the reason I wrote this sex tape,

20:37.924 --> 20:41.859
is because mid-coitus is when
one's true feelings come out.

20:41.860 --> 20:45.284
Okay? So we have to believe
that Josh Chan truly hates Jesus,

20:45.309 --> 20:48.198
and that pure, utter hatred,

20:48.223 --> 20:52.753
it explodes out of him with
a sexual and euphoric passion.

20:53.768 --> 20:55.718
All right, no. Next!

20:56.518 --> 20:58.555
The waters are not for the actors!

20:59.230 --> 21:01.876
And don't forget to sign the
non-disclosure agreement, okay?

21:01.877 --> 21:02.948
Can't have that guy blogging about this.

21:02.949 --> 21:04.901
Come on, Rebecca.

21:04.902 --> 21:07.565
I mean, maybe if you didn't,
like, yell at all of them.

21:07.590 --> 21:08.923
Uh, oh, I'm sorry, Heather.

21:08.924 --> 21:10.901
I'm the one who has to
be in bed with these guys.

21:10.902 --> 21:11.944
Yeah, and why does it have to be you?

21:11.945 --> 21:13.897
You don't have any lines.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.257
Verisimilitude.

21:16.282 --> 21:18.234
It has to be me to sell the concept.

21:19.412 --> 21:22.399
- All right, who's this guy?
- Well, this guy did...

21:22.429 --> 21:24.398
Hello, I'm Colin Crowley.

21:24.431 --> 21:26.442
Wonderful to meet you.
I'm here for the read.

21:26.467 --> 21:28.656
Really excited about the material.

21:30.742 --> 21:32.124
Yeah.

21:32.341 --> 21:36.273
Wow. He looks just like Josh.

21:36.298 --> 21:38.231
That could be his brother.

21:39.449 --> 21:40.482
It's uncanny.

21:40.507 --> 21:41.923
Okay, um, one second.

21:41.924 --> 21:43.943
I know what you ladies are thinking,

21:43.944 --> 21:45.919
but I really would love to
give this role to an American.

21:45.944 --> 21:48.956
Ooh, um, my American is spot-on.

21:48.981 --> 21:50.873
Okay.

21:50.898 --> 21:52.864
One, two, three, four, five, six.

21:53.652 --> 21:54.916
All right, okay, um...

21:54.941 --> 21:57.341
You want, eh, Chicago?

21:57.366 --> 22:00.185
New York? Um, Louisiana?

22:00.852 --> 22:01.948
Um, Texas?

22:01.949 --> 22:03.169
Or do you want, um...

22:03.194 --> 22:05.210
Southern California, dude?

22:06.114 --> 22:08.591
Wow.

22:09.222 --> 22:11.260
We have an Olivier here.

22:24.948 --> 22:27.947
Oh, I booked it, mate. Sorry.

22:28.174 --> 22:30.140
Cheers, though.

22:33.044 --> 22:35.442
Okay, we are done with the auditions.

22:35.467 --> 22:36.487
We found our man.

22:36.512 --> 22:37.802
Feel free to give up on your dreams

22:37.827 --> 22:39.246
and move back to your hometowns.

22:39.271 --> 22:41.078
Okay.

22:41.103 --> 22:44.136
- Nathaniel, what are you... ?
- What's going on here?

22:44.747 --> 22:45.914
Dude, okay, so,

22:45.915 --> 22:46.930
when are we stopping this charade?

22:46.931 --> 22:47.948
It's getting so weird.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.278
I didn't think we were gonna

22:49.303 --> 22:50.435
find someone who's, like, a shave

22:50.460 --> 22:52.424
and a nose job away from being Josh.

22:52.449 --> 22:53.914
It's starting to freak me out.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.947
Yeah, I knew we were gonna wait
for her to come to her senses,

22:55.948 --> 22:57.913
but can we slap some
sense into her already?

22:57.914 --> 22:59.637
We need to put a stop to this.

22:59.662 --> 23:01.732
No, I know it feels like we're
riding the edge of a razor,

23:01.757 --> 23:03.711
but I'm telling you, as a parent,

23:03.736 --> 23:05.528
the more you forbid it,
the more they want it,

23:05.553 --> 23:07.581
so we just got to ride it out. Yeah.

23:08.652 --> 23:10.675
God.

23:10.948 --> 23:12.889
What are all these guys doing here?

23:12.890 --> 23:14.889
I don't know. You have to sign
an NDA before I tell you that.

23:14.890 --> 23:15.898
What are you doing here?

23:15.899 --> 23:17.905
Oh, I was just, uh, was just running by,

23:17.906 --> 23:20.901
and, um, phone died, so, you
know, thought maybe I could,

23:20.902 --> 23:21.927
uh, come in and juice it up.

23:21.928 --> 23:24.140
Ugh, "running by"? But
you live across town.

23:26.827 --> 23:27.881
Wait.

23:27.906 --> 23:28.927
Wow.

23:28.928 --> 23:31.249
The old
my-phone-ran-out-of-juice, really?

23:31.274 --> 23:33.944
Listen, buddy... you're 
talking to the queen of,

23:33.945 --> 23:35.421
"I just happened to be here."

23:35.940 --> 23:38.851
Okay, I get what's happening.

23:39.049 --> 23:41.889
Listen, I know we kissed,
and you helped me with my dad

23:41.890 --> 23:42.922
and you are clearly developing

23:42.923 --> 23:43.940
some kind of sparkly, little-girl,

23:43.941 --> 23:45.753
heart, twinkly feelings for me...

23:45.778 --> 23:46.866
... but then I came back

23:46.891 --> 23:48.243
as this espresso-haired vixen

23:48.268 --> 23:50.893
and you feel low status,

23:50.894 --> 23:52.934
which I get. I get it, okay?

23:52.935 --> 23:55.913
Status reversals, ugh,
they are confusing,

23:55.914 --> 23:57.893
and arousing and it's probably
never happened to you before,

23:57.894 --> 24:00.859
so now you are understandably
obsessed with me.

24:00.860 --> 24:02.859
No, that's not it at all.

24:02.860 --> 24:04.197
Okay? Not at all.

24:04.222 --> 24:06.940
- No? Really?
- No.

24:06.941 --> 24:10.868
You're not mesmerized by
my sudden lack of interest

24:10.869 --> 24:12.353
and my cold, unavailable vibe?

24:13.947 --> 24:15.844
No.

24:15.869 --> 24:18.898
Yeah? Huh, interesting,
'cause your thin shorts say otherwise.

24:18.899 --> 24:20.884
Oh, listen.

24:20.885 --> 24:21.919
Listen, buddy.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.893
I would be happy to take
you for a tumble sometime...

24:24.894 --> 24:25.910
... but right now,

24:25.911 --> 24:27.341
I'm really distracted
with something else,

24:27.366 --> 24:28.445
so just move along. Yeah.

24:30.948 --> 24:32.317
Dude.

24:32.342 --> 24:33.653
Auditions are over.

24:33.678 --> 24:35.575
You can take the banana
out of your pants.

24:43.058 --> 24:45.086
Wheel of Fortune was good tonight.

24:45.759 --> 24:49.333
Yeah. All the big hitters
were there tonight.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.651
Ooh. "R."

24:51.919 --> 24:53.922
- "S."
- Yeah.

24:53.923 --> 24:55.442
- "T."
- Mm-hmm.

24:55.467 --> 24:57.137
- "E."
- Yeah.

24:58.966 --> 25:00.943
I'd like to buy a kiss.

25:05.890 --> 25:07.419
Okay.

25:17.308 --> 25:18.744
Babe, I've really missed you.

25:18.769 --> 25:20.267
I missed you, too.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.944
Scott.

25:32.899 --> 25:33.858
Paula.

25:33.883 --> 25:34.903
Mm.

25:35.048 --> 25:36.405
No, don't call me Paula.

25:36.430 --> 25:37.748
Call me Tanya.

25:37.773 --> 25:39.467
- What?
- No, just do it.

25:39.492 --> 25:40.928
Call me Tanya.

25:42.678 --> 25:44.794
I have no idea what that was

25:44.819 --> 25:47.084
and I never want to discuss it.

25:57.476 --> 26:00.872
Honk, honk! Honk, honk!

26:00.873 --> 26:02.203
I don't know what sound anteaters make,

26:02.228 --> 26:04.935
- but here, have a protein bar.
- Thanks.

26:04.936 --> 26:06.554
You, sir.

26:06.797 --> 26:08.250
Here, big fella.

26:09.352 --> 26:11.334
They're, uh, 52 grams

26:11.335 --> 26:13.148
of pure insect power!

26:13.173 --> 26:16.757
- Aah, wow.
- Huh? Huh?

26:16.828 --> 26:19.437
This is what you meant when
you texted "surprise time"?

26:19.462 --> 26:22.486
Yes. Okay, okay.
Here goes.

26:22.487 --> 26:24.226
You needed a name for your bars,

26:24.251 --> 26:25.515
so I went to the trademark office

26:25.516 --> 26:27.460
and these are the ones that were taken.

26:27.461 --> 26:31.497
"Ant Time, "Ant Protein Time,
Supergood Insect Protein Time,

26:31.498 --> 26:33.187
- Supergood Ant Time."
- Okay.

26:33.212 --> 26:36.437
But then I realized, if you
eat ants, that makes you an...

26:38.000 --> 26:40.781
- an anteater. Huh?
- Anteater, yeah.

26:40.806 --> 26:42.006
So, I went with that and then

26:42.031 --> 26:45.535
I talked to Manuel who
does graphics for us and...

26:45.536 --> 26:47.481
- voilà.
- _

26:47.482 --> 26:49.539
You took my bars out of your fridge?

26:49.540 --> 26:51.289
You left them there for a reason.

26:51.314 --> 26:53.481
That's what my dream interpreter said.

26:53.482 --> 26:54.502
- Oh, my God.
- And by the way,

26:54.503 --> 26:57.810
I got a totally new guy,
'cause Reiki is baloney.

26:57.835 --> 27:00.518
So, yes, I took them,
and I did all this,

27:00.519 --> 27:03.489
and people love them
and now your career is on its way,

27:03.490 --> 27:05.726
so you can move on to
tinier, cuter things.

27:06.523 --> 27:08.465
Ah, there it is.

27:08.820 --> 27:10.511
The baby thing again. God.

27:10.967 --> 27:13.928
Oh. Well, I'm sorry.

27:14.210 --> 27:18.448
I mean, I know, I said I was gonna
try harder and I messed up.

27:18.914 --> 27:21.469
Honk, honk. What can I do?

27:21.470 --> 27:23.265
Don't do that. Don't do anything.

27:23.290 --> 27:24.336
Honk?

27:26.148 --> 27:28.456
Maybe we do need a therapist.

27:29.835 --> 27:32.518
I'll get one, a real one.

27:32.644 --> 27:34.665
None of this Reiki nonsense.

27:40.086 --> 27:41.568
I was scared to death 
to have sex with him

27:41.569 --> 27:42.593
and then that happened.

27:42.594 --> 27:43.611
Let me get this straight.

27:43.781 --> 27:47.234
You told Scott to call you Tanya in bed?

27:47.259 --> 27:49.246
Yeah, it's horrifying.

27:49.527 --> 27:53.320
But the sex was amazing.
How can that be? I hate Tanya.

27:53.345 --> 27:57.100
Well, sounds like the only
way you can feel sexy right now

27:57.125 --> 27:59.573
is to imitate the female
he chose instead of you.

27:59.598 --> 28:01.564
Like, you feel insecure,

28:01.565 --> 28:03.568
so you want to be the
transgressive "harlot"

28:03.569 --> 28:05.535
he temporarily desired over you.

28:05.536 --> 28:07.335
Wow. What class did you learn that in?

28:07.360 --> 28:08.594
Oh, that's just me.

28:08.595 --> 28:12.398
I'm thinking about becoming a life coach
or maybe a mime.

28:12.423 --> 28:15.564
I just put body makeup
on a man's butt crack.

28:15.565 --> 28:17.951
Yeah. He's very sweaty. It took forever.

28:17.976 --> 28:20.548
He smells like pencil
shavings and vinegar.

28:21.890 --> 28:24.518
Are we really going through
with this? This feels too far.

28:24.519 --> 28:26.164
Hold, sister, hold. Stay the course.

28:26.189 --> 28:28.568
Rebecca is gonna realize
it's the wrong path.

28:28.569 --> 28:30.597
It's just, it can't come from us.

28:30.598 --> 28:33.429
Excuse me, is there a
P.A. to fetch me a bagel?

28:33.934 --> 28:35.912
I'm a bit peckish, eh?

28:36.617 --> 28:38.581
Oh, come on. Rebecca's gonna come out,

28:38.582 --> 28:41.526
take one look at that dude
in a towel and freak out.

28:41.527 --> 28:43.921
All right. I'm ready. Let's do this.

28:50.328 --> 28:52.593
Okay, so, I tried all the
stuff you gave me, Valencia,

28:52.594 --> 28:54.195
and it just, it didn't work.

28:54.220 --> 28:56.177
You know, I tried the
pasties and the bandeau,

28:56.202 --> 28:58.171
the nude bodysuit, the
green-screen underwear,

28:58.196 --> 29:00.228
but I just, I can't
feel inhibited right now.

29:00.416 --> 29:04.452
Okay? If I'm gonna have fake sex
with fake Josh, it has to feel real.

29:04.937 --> 29:06.054
Wait.

29:06.239 --> 29:08.247
W-W-Wait,
okay.

29:08.553 --> 29:09.603
Okay, hear me out.

29:09.999 --> 29:13.030
If authenticity is what we're going for,

29:13.820 --> 29:17.171
I mean, shouldn't we
just do it for real?

29:17.548 --> 29:19.976
Yeah, let's just do it for real.
Um, okay.

29:20.001 --> 29:22.382
Someone get me a condom.
They are in my dresser.

29:22.407 --> 29:24.085
Actually, we may not
need to use condoms.

29:24.110 --> 29:27.535
Paula, look up the statutes for porn in
the state of California for condom use.

29:27.536 --> 29:29.552
You know what? Let's do one with
a condom, one without a condom,

29:29.553 --> 29:31.890
- that way we've covered our bases.
- Okay, we're done. We're done.

29:31.915 --> 29:34.968
- That's a wrap on the fake sex tape.
- What?!

29:34.993 --> 29:37.554
Uh, Rebecca, put some clothes on.

29:37.579 --> 29:39.265
- Sir...
- Ow, my vagina.

29:39.290 --> 29:41.585
Sir, I'm gonna call it for today.

29:41.586 --> 29:46.085
Um, my best to Princess Kate,
the new people's princess.

29:46.110 --> 29:47.569
Rebecca.

29:47.570 --> 29:50.865
This is not a good plan!

29:50.890 --> 29:53.679
Even if you hurt Josh,
you're gonna hurt yourself more.

29:53.704 --> 29:56.820
You'll be exposing yourself publicly.
You'll be humiliated.

29:56.845 --> 29:59.804
Why would you put
yourself out like that?

30:01.765 --> 30:03.671
Because I don't care what happens to me.

30:05.415 --> 30:06.448
I don't.

30:07.773 --> 30:11.773
I mean, God, okay, I guess I don't
want to get, like, "in trouble,"

30:11.805 --> 30:13.124
but also I don't care.

30:13.149 --> 30:15.173
I don't care.

30:16.437 --> 30:18.679
And I don't...

30:18.704 --> 30:20.611
I guess I thought that
if I could be near a Josh,

30:20.612 --> 30:22.015
just even a fake one,

30:22.070 --> 30:24.787
that-that-that-that things
would become clear, you know?

30:24.812 --> 30:26.056
Because I haven't seen

30:26.057 --> 30:29.060
the real Josh since before
he left me at the altar.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.584
I haven't seen him or
talked to him and I

30:30.609 --> 30:32.107
just thought that if
I made the sex tape,

30:32.108 --> 30:34.081
and maybe he could see the tape,

30:34.082 --> 30:36.060
and he would know and this was what?

30:36.061 --> 30:38.073
This was a horrible idea.

30:38.433 --> 30:39.757
Honey.

30:40.032 --> 30:41.065
Honey.

30:41.706 --> 30:44.603
You know that we are all here
to help you take down Josh,

30:44.628 --> 30:47.069
but we are not gonna help you

30:47.070 --> 30:49.102
take down yourself at the same time.

30:49.456 --> 30:50.956
Sorry to interrupt,

30:50.981 --> 30:53.971
but I never did get my bagel. Also, um,

30:53.996 --> 30:56.024
if you're interested, I
had a couple of line tweaks

30:56.090 --> 30:58.548
to make Josh a more
sympathetic character.

30:58.573 --> 31:01.031
- Oh, hell no.
- This guy.

31:01.032 --> 31:02.115
- Get out.
- Do you know Josh?

31:02.116 --> 31:04.102
- Bye.
- I don't think you know Josh.

31:04.103 --> 31:06.031
- You need new headshots.
- Get your check in the mail.

31:14.800 --> 31:17.392
Uh, thank you for seeing us on
such short notice, Dr. Akopian.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.089
Yeah, we've heard wonderful things.

31:19.090 --> 31:20.369
Oh, thank you.

31:20.394 --> 31:22.800
You might be thinking of my wife.

31:23.032 --> 31:26.085
Her Yelp reviews are off the charts.

31:26.777 --> 31:28.542
Please call me Davit.

31:28.691 --> 31:30.652
Uh, what can I help you with?

31:31.049 --> 31:34.077
Well, he's annoyed because
I wore an anteater costume,

31:34.078 --> 31:35.509
but for a very good reason.

31:35.534 --> 31:38.111
- I just wanted to help your business.
- That is not why you did it.

31:38.112 --> 31:40.035
You did it because you're
trying to pressure me

31:40.036 --> 31:43.052
into having a baby, even though I
don't know if I ever want to do that.

31:43.053 --> 31:44.839
- So now you hate babies.
- Oh, my God.

31:44.864 --> 31:47.035
Can we back up? I heard "anteater"?

31:47.036 --> 31:48.057
That can't be right.

31:48.058 --> 31:49.800
Exactly. That's exactly my point.

31:49.825 --> 31:53.060
He takes everything to the extreme.
I didn't say I hate babies.

31:53.061 --> 31:57.252
You're too emotional, Darryl.
You get so excited about a baby

31:57.277 --> 32:00.220
or about my ant-based protein bars, and
you go from, like, zero to a thousand.

32:00.245 --> 32:03.069
- That is not fair.
- It is fair, dude.

32:03.070 --> 32:04.111
You found out that a distant relative

32:04.112 --> 32:06.431
was Native American, and
you had your last name

32:06.456 --> 32:08.306
changed to "Whitefeather" the next day.

32:08.331 --> 32:10.093
And now we have to get to the
airport, like, three hours early

32:10.094 --> 32:12.073
because none of your IDs
match... it's ridiculous.

32:12.074 --> 32:15.603
First of all, those are my people.
And second of all, that's just who I am,

32:15.628 --> 32:18.447
enthusiastic, and you
chose me knowing that.

32:18.472 --> 32:21.470
- I thought you liked it.
- I do like it, but also,

32:21.495 --> 32:23.085
sometimes it drives me nuts.

32:23.086 --> 32:26.259
- So you just think I'm an idiot.
- No, I... You're doing it again.

32:26.284 --> 32:28.052
Well, maybe I am an idiot.

32:28.053 --> 32:30.098
But you know what?
This idiot, in two days,

32:30.099 --> 32:32.048
has done more with your idea

32:32.049 --> 32:34.052
- than you've done in two years.
- Okay...

32:34.053 --> 32:37.114
This idiot co-owns a
very successful law firm.

32:37.115 --> 32:40.784
Okay, successful law firm,
and is a magnificent father.

32:41.090 --> 32:43.127
Now, look, I know that I got way
out ahead of you with the baby,

32:43.128 --> 32:45.417
and I'm sorry, and I'll stop it.

32:46.274 --> 32:49.257
But I'm a catch. Start acting like it.

32:53.847 --> 32:55.269
You know what?

32:57.049 --> 32:58.316
You're right.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.347
I'm sorry. Maybe I have been...

33:02.053 --> 33:04.433
a little judgy of you.

33:05.072 --> 33:07.485
Huh. My friends all say I'm judgy,

33:07.510 --> 33:09.227
but I never listen to
them or care what they say

33:09.252 --> 33:11.119
because they're stupid idiots.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.377
I'm sorry, D.

33:19.299 --> 33:21.077
Men are the worst, aren't they?

33:21.078 --> 33:23.596
- Awful.
- So entitled.

33:23.621 --> 33:25.680
Josh Chan, fake Josh Chan, all of them.

33:25.705 --> 33:28.048
They always make everything about them.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.094
That's exactly what I'm saying.

33:29.095 --> 33:31.035
The reason we're in this situation

33:31.036 --> 33:32.078
is because men are so terrible.

33:32.079 --> 33:34.064
Don't get me started on men.

33:34.065 --> 33:36.060
Don't get me started on men.

- isn't working lately.
- You guys are right.

36:27.382 --> 36:29.364
My ideas have been awful.
And it's weird because,

36:29.365 --> 36:31.314
you know, I'm usually so brilliant.

36:31.315 --> 36:33.356
Yeah, yeah, and that
is one of the things

36:33.357 --> 36:35.347
that I am really mad at Josh about.

36:35.348 --> 36:37.327
He turned the smartest
person I know into

36:37.328 --> 36:39.039
a sad, wannabe porn star.

36:39.064 --> 36:40.907
Brutal, but true.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.453
Huh, trutal.

36:43.478 --> 36:45.498
- That's good.
- These are really good.

36:45.523 --> 36:47.875
Yeah, Josh... Josh is the worst

36:47.900 --> 36:50.110
You know, I can't even book
another wedding because of him.

36:50.203 --> 36:51.241
His jilting you

36:51.375 --> 36:53.383
has completely ruined my business.

36:53.408 --> 36:56.347
I swear, I should totally
sue his ass or something.

36:57.358 --> 37:00.180
Sue him, that's funny.

37:01.357 --> 37:02.813
Wait, no, no, no.

37:02.838 --> 37:03.850
Sue him.

37:03.875 --> 37:05.348
That's actually a
really interesting idea.

37:05.349 --> 37:08.335
There is tons of case law that justifies

37:08.336 --> 37:09.743
suing him on behalf of Rebecca

37:09.770 --> 37:11.819
on, like... on, like, several fronts.

37:11.820 --> 37:15.769
Breach of contract, alienation
of affection. Financial damages.

37:15.770 --> 37:19.778
- Whoa, that's such a smart idea, Paula.
- Thank you.

37:19.779 --> 37:21.781
Actually, it was my idea.

37:21.782 --> 37:24.081
Oh, my God, it's perfect! It's perfect.

37:24.106 --> 37:26.786
You get to humiliate Josh publicly,

37:26.787 --> 37:28.806
you get to maintain your dignity,

37:28.807 --> 37:31.819
and you become a hero in the process.

37:31.820 --> 37:33.810
Oh, my God, Cookie, the answer was

37:33.811 --> 37:35.786
right under our noses.

37:35.787 --> 37:39.765
Yeah, God, that's...
that's a great idea.

37:39.766 --> 37:41.769
I mean, that's hard to argue

37:41.770 --> 37:43.806
why that isn't the perfect idea.

37:43.807 --> 37:46.773
- Well... yeah!
- Like, the perfect...

37:46.774 --> 37:50.773
Oh, feeling my mojo coming back.

37:50.774 --> 37:52.810
- Yeah, it is.
- Oh, I can feel it.

37:52.811 --> 37:54.794
That idea is brilliant.

37:54.795 --> 37:56.823
It's b... it's brilliant. I'm brilliant.

37:56.824 --> 37:59.823
It's so... You're so smart.

37:59.824 --> 38:02.769
It was my idea. Can't anyone hear me?

38:02.770 --> 38:04.363
Why didn't we think of that before?

38:04.388 --> 38:06.481
You're amazing. One up top.

38:06.506 --> 38:07.560
Am I dead?

38:09.876 --> 38:11.350
How did I die?

38:17.384 --> 38:21.353
Hey. Hey, hey, wake up.

38:21.354 --> 38:23.387
Wake up, it's me.

38:23.388 --> 38:26.825
I am so horny.

38:26.850 --> 38:30.129
Oh, okay.

38:30.154 --> 38:31.840
Uh, uh, babe?

38:31.865 --> 38:33.914
I don't want to call
you Tanya this time.

38:34.176 --> 38:36.825
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

38:36.850 --> 38:39.330
That was... that was horrible.
That was so bad.

38:39.331 --> 38:40.606
Because I don't want Tanya.

38:40.631 --> 38:42.754
Oh, that's good, though,
'cause I killed her.

38:44.343 --> 38:46.965
Kidding. I'm kidding.

38:46.990 --> 38:48.388
No, I'm not.

38:48.389 --> 38:49.582
Yes, I am. Listen.

38:49.607 --> 38:51.681
Shh, babe, babe,

38:52.036 --> 38:55.964
I just came up with the best idea ever.

38:55.965 --> 38:57.707
I am so cool.

38:57.732 --> 38:59.801
So, come on, baby...

39:01.036 --> 39:02.848
call me Paula.

39:09.582 --> 39:12.356
- Hey.
- Wha...

39:12.969 --> 39:17.018
Sorry. Um, I will...
think about the baby thing.

39:17.019 --> 39:20.325
- What? Oh...
- Okay, just wanted to say that.

39:20.350 --> 39:22.418
So, I'm gonna go. By the way,

39:22.562 --> 39:24.325
this thing is amazing.

39:24.350 --> 39:26.040
You were right all along. I
should have never doubted you.

39:26.410 --> 39:28.496
I've already gotten,
like, 500 pre-orders, so.

39:28.521 --> 39:30.536
I have some ants to kill.

39:31.019 --> 39:32.910
Honk, honk.

39:39.050 --> 39:41.027
Okay, what we have to
show the jury, though,

39:41.028 --> 39:43.039
is proximate cause, to wit,

39:43.040 --> 39:46.729
how long in advance did Josh
plan to ruin your wedding?

39:46.754 --> 39:49.056
Okay, are we talking
specific intent or negligence?

39:49.057 --> 39:51.048
Speaking of negligence,
I've been meaning to ask you,

39:51.049 --> 39:53.659
- who's Robert?
- Sorry, who?

39:53.684 --> 39:55.049
Is that relevant to the case?

39:55.050 --> 39:57.010
You said his name out loud on the cliff,

39:57.011 --> 39:58.981
with all those other abandoning turds.

39:58.982 --> 40:00.722
And, you know, you seemed
really upset about it, and...

40:01.044 --> 40:04.027
Right, right, so, Robert was my dog.

40:04.028 --> 40:07.039
And it was a dog I loved,
and he was a male dog.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.661
And he ran away and
just left me one day.

40:09.686 --> 40:11.028
They're all monsters.

40:11.029 --> 40:13.048
- Mm-hmm.
- Hi, are you Rebecca?

40:13.216 --> 40:15.014
Yeah...

40:15.015 --> 40:18.325
I'm Nathaniel's date.
He wanted you to see me,

40:18.350 --> 40:20.419
so, this is what I look like.

40:20.444 --> 40:23.014
That... that is not what I said, okay?

40:23.015 --> 40:25.035
I was very specific about what I wanted

40:25.036 --> 40:26.591
with Casting Call magazine.

40:26.616 --> 40:28.582
- Can I have a bottle of water?
- Oh, my God.

40:28.607 --> 40:29.636
Get out.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.634
- So stupid...
- Come on, come on.

40:31.729 --> 40:32.737
That's...

40:36.999 --> 40:38.981
Okay, I don't know what that was...

40:38.982 --> 40:41.497
I do, but it's... Honestly,
it's so heartbreaking

40:41.522 --> 40:42.661
I can't... I can't even...

40:42.686 --> 40:44.659
Anyway, this is so fun.

40:44.684 --> 40:48.032
You and me, plus the law...
we are unstoppable.

40:48.033 --> 40:49.341
And this révenge,

40:49.366 --> 40:52.763
this will actually make
you feel better, I know it.

40:52.787 --> 40:54.363
Oh, my God, totally.
Like, what could be more

40:54.388 --> 40:56.097
emotionally satisfying
than parsing the fine points

40:56.122 --> 40:58.341
- of tortious interference?
- Right?

40:58.366 --> 40:59.791
And this is gonna make
you feel so much better

40:59.792 --> 41:01.748
than pooping in a plastic container.

41:01.749 --> 41:02.819
- Totally.
- I'm so glad

41:02.820 --> 41:04.050
you got that out of your system.

41:04.075 --> 41:07.777
I mean, it was just,
it was so silly and not smart.

41:07.778 --> 41:10.129
I know, it was just me
being, like, kind of a sad,

41:10.154 --> 41:12.170
desperate child acting out.

41:12.195 --> 41:13.990
So, this is way better.

41:37.426 --> 41:40.840
