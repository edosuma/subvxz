07:16.170 --> 07:18.637
- I did. [laughs]
Thank you for noticing.

07:18.773 --> 07:20.573
I have this tic
where I just, like,

07:20.708 --> 07:22.775
quote Patrick Swayze movies.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.643
I'm crazy for Swayze, I know.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.379
- [dreamily] No way-ze.
- Okay.

07:26.513 --> 07:30.115
So has anyone ever heard of
a term called unconscious bias?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.718
- Oh, I'm not sure.
Why don't you run it "bi-us"?

07:32.720 --> 07:35.721
- [laughing]
- Woof.

07:36.057 --> 07:39.725
- Okay. Let's dive in.
- [sighs happily]

07:39.860 --> 07:42.061
She is perfect.

07:42.063 --> 07:43.863
Absolutely perfect.
[exhales]

07:43.998 --> 07:46.131
Blue hair with streaks
of purple--ooh. Tall...

07:46.267 --> 07:49.001
- Yeah, congrats on kind of
keeping yourself under control.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.202
- I'm not an idiot.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.605
She's the sexual
bias instructor.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.073
- Hey, sorry to interrupt.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.275
It's just, is there
a lady's bathroom anywhere?

07:56.411 --> 07:57.877
- Mm, not really,

07:58.012 --> 07:59.612
but the closest thing's
down the hall, to the right.

07:59.747 --> 08:00.946
- Cool. Thanks.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.281
- Oh, hey, Courtney.
- Yes?

08:02.417 --> 08:04.016
- We're about to have lunch.
Are you hungry?

08:04.151 --> 08:06.151
- Oh, I couldn't.
Thank you, though.

08:06.287 --> 08:08.353
- Hold on, hold on.
I'm cooking something special.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.022
And I was thinking maybe
you could help us find

08:10.157 --> 08:12.691
some more of our blind spots,
because we got some.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.093
- Sure.

08:14.095 --> 08:16.561
I don't have a ton of time,
but it's a deal.

08:16.563 --> 08:17.630
You better be a good cook.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.232
- The best.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.234
- Okay.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.302
- Boy, is you stuck on stupid?

08:23.438 --> 08:25.104
We just got done
with that seminar.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.839
- With all
your woman driver jokes,

08:26.974 --> 08:28.974
I'm thinking maybe you need
to learn some more.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.843
- Uh-uh, stop.
We see what you're doing.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.177
- I'm not doing anything.

08:32.313 --> 08:33.712
Although, it has occurred to me

08:33.714 --> 08:35.180
that it's not harassment

08:35.316 --> 08:37.983
if I get her to ask me out.

08:38.119 --> 08:39.918
[laughter]
- Son of a bitch.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.386
- You think you're gonna get

08:41.522 --> 08:43.456
the sexual harassment
instructor to ask you out

08:43.590 --> 08:45.258
after
the sexual harassment class?

08:45.392 --> 08:46.992
- I'm already doing well
with stage one:

08:46.994 --> 08:48.461
non-flirting flirting.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.195
- Non-flirting flirting?

08:50.197 --> 08:51.664
- It's master-level stuff.

08:51.799 --> 08:52.998
- Yeah;
that's where I hit on her

08:53.134 --> 08:54.600
without actually
hitting on her.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.068
It's so imperceptible.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.736
She doesn't even realize
it's already working.

08:57.872 --> 09:00.273
- Like carbon monoxide.
- Exactly.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.875
I gotta go cook lunch.
- Okay.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.610
- It ain't gonna work!

09:04.745 --> 09:07.012
That ain't gonna work.
She's a trained professional.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.481
- I don't know, man.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.683
I think Cap could pull it off.

09:10.818 --> 09:11.884
- Put your money
where your mouth is.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.552
- Wait, you guys,
don't you think

09:13.554 --> 09:15.420
we should be putting a stop
to these Cap moves?

09:15.556 --> 09:18.824
- 50 bucks says Cap gets her
to ask him out.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.693
- Deal.
- Boom.

09:20.828 --> 09:21.827
- Have you guys
learned nothing?

09:21.963 --> 09:23.296
- What you mean?
- About what?

09:25.566 --> 09:26.865
- All right.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.400
Johnny,
get some measurements in here.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.868
Carl, let's see what
the subfloor looks like, huh?

09:30.004 --> 09:31.137
Let's move.
- Wow.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.338
There's a different Andy, huh?

09:32.473 --> 09:34.072
- Chief, did you look
at the book?

09:34.208 --> 09:35.474
- The sample book?
Yeah, I got it right here.

09:35.476 --> 09:37.075
I was thinking
about a medium pile.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.544
- No, you don't want
a medium pile.

09:38.679 --> 09:39.946
You want a low pile.
This is a high-traffic area.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.547
What about color?

09:41.682 --> 09:43.682
- I thought Raspberry Tart
looked pretty tasty.

09:43.818 --> 09:45.017
- Too dark.

09:45.153 --> 09:46.352
You want something
in the beige family,

09:46.487 --> 09:48.287
like Tuscan Marvel
or the Sedona Tidewater.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.222
- Oh, okay.
Tuscan. Marvel looks nice.

09:50.358 --> 09:52.090
- Tuscan Marvel it is.
Good choice.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.692
- Very similar to what I have.
- Tuscan Marvel.

09:53.828 --> 09:55.561
Good choice.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.762
- Okay, Tuscan Marvel.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.697
- Johnny!
What's taking so long, man?

09:58.699 --> 10:00.967
It's just a simple measurement.
It's 17, 3.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.568
- Hah. 17, 3.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.370
You just saw that?
- I can eyeball that.

10:04.505 --> 10:06.905
- I bet you're way off.
- Johnny, bring it over.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.507
- Oh.

10:08.509 --> 10:10.643
Whoa, right on the money.
How'd you do that?

10:10.778 --> 10:13.179
- It's what I do.
- Huh! Wow.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.314
- Okay, well, I was thinking
about this brand right here.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.049
- No, I wouldn't even wipe
my feet with that.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.651
I'd go with this brand.

10:18.653 --> 10:20.653
It's a dollar more per yard,
but it's well worth it.

10:20.655 --> 10:22.054
- Okay, stop, stop, stop.

10:22.190 --> 10:23.522
I know what
you're trying to do, Andy.

10:23.524 --> 10:26.792
I don't need
the more expensive one.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.996
- Ah, look at that beauty
of a family.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.530
You and your four daughters.

10:31.666 --> 10:33.199
- Well, that's my wife.
Of course you know that.

10:33.334 --> 10:37.203
- Man, how old are they now?
Like, what, 20-ish?

10:37.338 --> 10:39.071
- The younger ones
are teenagers.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.339
- Teenagers, yeah.
- And Lucy is, you know, Lucy.

10:40.341 --> 10:42.274
- Sure. Lucy is Lucy.
- Yeah.

10:42.276 --> 10:44.677
- You probably only get
the best for your daughters.

10:44.679 --> 10:46.278
- I do, yeah. Mm-hmm.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.014
- You should get the best
for yourself.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.748
I mean you are
the chief, right?

10:49.750 --> 10:50.883
- Yeah.

10:51.019 --> 10:52.951
- This brand
is so high quality,

10:53.087 --> 10:54.953
you'll actually
be saving money.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.089
- Saving money?
- Yeah.

10:57.225 --> 10:59.358
- Okay, well...
- Okay! Let's do that.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.159
And let's get some
of this stuff out of here.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.161
Come on, chop, chop.
Let's go.

11:03.297 --> 11:05.898
<i> [traditional Italian music]</i>
- Lunch is served.

11:06.034 --> 11:08.367
- Wow.
<i> - Cioppino Penisi.</i>

11:08.369 --> 11:12.304
<i> Il pesce piu fresco</i>
<i> per tutto Tacoma.</i>

11:12.306 --> 11:13.972
- You speak Italian?
- Eh.

11:14.108 --> 11:16.508
<i> Un pochino.</i>
<i> Mangiate, per favore.</i>

11:16.510 --> 11:18.577
- God, you guys get crab legs
for lunch?

11:18.713 --> 11:20.579
I love crab legs.

11:20.581 --> 11:23.449
Do you mind
if I eat with my hands, or...

11:23.584 --> 11:24.851
- Yeah, of course.
- Oh, okay!

11:24.985 --> 11:26.318
Because they're way better

11:26.320 --> 11:27.453
when you're just
eating with your hands.

11:27.588 --> 11:29.988
Look how soft.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.190
Mmm! Oh, my God.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.459
<i> Splendido.</i>

11:33.594 --> 11:34.927
<i> - Grazie,</i> Courtney.
<i> Mangiamo.</i>

11:35.063 --> 11:37.463
- Mmm!

11:37.598 --> 11:39.398
- Yeah,
there's cracks all along here.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.599
Do you see those?

11:40.601 --> 11:42.200
- Look at those cracks
over there.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.335
- So many cracks.
Cracks here, cracks there.

11:43.471 --> 11:44.803
I mean, they're...
- Wow. Okay.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.338
- The whole floor.
- I mean,

11:46.340 --> 11:48.074
and then there's a bunch
of cracks over here, Chief.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.542
- Cracks everywhere.
- Yeah.

11:49.677 --> 11:51.277
This would usually cost you
so much more,

11:51.412 --> 11:53.879
but I'm gonna absorb
the patchwork on my end.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.147
Okay, Chief?

11:55.149 --> 11:56.749
- Yeah, okay.
- Just for you.

11:56.751 --> 11:59.217
Carl!
Let me see that.

11:59.353 --> 12:00.953
Where did you get
this blade, huh?

12:01.089 --> 12:02.688
The bottom of a cereal box?

12:03.223 --> 12:04.623
Go. Get a new blade!

12:04.759 --> 12:07.493
You're embarrassing me.
Blades are cheap!

12:08.162 --> 12:11.697
Johnny.
Thank you so much.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.165
Mmm!

12:13.167 --> 12:16.235
Johnny, nice "cappuccins."

12:16.370 --> 12:19.105
You want one of these, Chief?
- Nope. I'm good.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.773
That's how we got here
in the first place.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.574
[both laughing]

12:22.576 --> 12:23.909
- Man, nice one.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.512
So funny, Chief.
You are so funny.

12:26.647 --> 12:29.982
So we have you done for
the super-blend poly adhesive.

12:29.984 --> 12:32.318
I also have you down
for that stain guard coating.

12:32.453 --> 12:36.322
- Oh, I don't need that.
- Chief, it's only $50 more.

12:36.457 --> 12:38.924
Plus I'm absorbing
all of the patchwork

12:39.059 --> 12:40.392
and you're not getting
padding in here.

12:40.528 --> 12:42.261
I wouldn't skimp
on the stain guard.

12:42.396 --> 12:43.529
- Stop with the upselling,
Andy.

12:43.664 --> 12:44.931
You think I don't get it?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.865
I'm a savvy customer.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.134
I'm not gonna pay
the extra costs.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.202
- Wow! You did it.
You got me.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.939
- Yeah.
- Boy, you are good.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.873
- I've never seen
Salesman Andy before.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.408
It's kinda weird.

12:56.410 --> 12:58.344
- Well, they have a saying
in the carpet business,

12:58.479 --> 13:01.480
"You show weakness,
you get walked on."

13:01.615 --> 13:03.749
- [chuckling] Okay. All right.
Well, you know what?

13:03.884 --> 13:06.152
I can see it a mile away.
So don't waste your time.

13:06.287 --> 13:07.886
- I'm not gonna waste
any more of your time.

13:08.022 --> 13:10.356
You just need to pick a scent
for the carpet deodorizer.

13:10.491 --> 13:12.491
- Okay, I don't need
any carpet deodorizer.

13:12.627 --> 13:14.360
- What about the smell
in here, Chief?

13:14.495 --> 13:17.229
- What smell?
- Ah, no offense, Chief,

13:17.231 --> 13:20.232
but it smells like breath
and hot dog water in here.

13:20.368 --> 13:22.568
- Hot-dog water?
- No. Hot<i> dog</i> water.

13:22.703 --> 13:24.703
Everybody's talking about it.
Trust me.

13:24.839 --> 13:28.040
This is the way to stop
the whispering around here.

13:28.042 --> 13:30.442
- Okay.

13:30.444 --> 13:32.310
I think it smells fine in here.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.980
It smells like me.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.182
[upbeat music playing
on speaker]

13:36.316 --> 13:37.916
- Hey Captain, do you want
some help with that?

13:38.052 --> 13:39.852
- No, no.
I love doing dishes.

13:39.854 --> 13:41.119
It's something I'm good at.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.588
- You're also good
at making lunch.

13:42.723 --> 13:44.657
- Well, feeding people
makes me happy.

13:44.659 --> 13:47.326
- Courtney, can I get you a cup
of coffee or something?

13:47.328 --> 13:48.727
- Yeah, just black, though.

13:48.863 --> 13:50.929
[dish clatters loudly]

13:51.065 --> 13:52.531
Are you okay?

13:52.667 --> 13:54.132
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everything's fine.

13:54.268 --> 13:57.135
Just listening to the tune.
Vibing out.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.538
Man, I feel this one
in my bones.

13:59.674 --> 14:02.274
Yeah, you can't help but move
to this one.

14:02.410 --> 14:05.878
- Oh, there he goes.
- He's a pretty good dancer.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.214
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey! Yeah!

14:08.349 --> 14:10.482
- Oh!
- Come on. Who's feeling it?

14:10.618 --> 14:12.284
All right.
Come on up here.

14:12.420 --> 14:13.819
You don't need a reason
to get on the dance floor.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.354
Come on, Ike, you're a dancer.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:15.489 --> 14:16.889
I mean...
- It'd be weird if I...

14:16.891 --> 14:20.226
- No, it looks fun.
- Oh, there we go.

14:20.361 --> 14:22.695
- Whoa.
- Come on. Yeah.

14:22.697 --> 14:25.564
Oh, yeah. There we go.
- I love dancing, but I can't.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.366
We're working.
- Yeah?

14:27.501 --> 14:28.901
Courtney, you know,
I used to be a break-dancer.

14:29.037 --> 14:30.436
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:30.571 --> 14:31.970
Break-dancing was my thing.

14:32.106 --> 14:33.906
- Really?
- Check it out.

14:34.042 --> 14:35.507
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

14:35.509 --> 14:37.376
- Watch out.
Oh, it's going down there.

14:37.378 --> 14:38.977
- Oh.
- It's coming back up.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.247
- Whoo.
- Whoa, baby.

14:41.382 --> 14:44.316
- Oh, hey what's that?
- Oh, that?

14:45.119 --> 14:46.985
- Who put this piece

22:43.531 --> 22:47.333
So the best I can do
is knock off my commission.

22:47.335 --> 22:48.668
- Now we're talking.

22:48.802 --> 22:51.136
- You're cool with me
forfeiting my commission?

22:51.138 --> 22:54.674
- I wasn't born yesterday.
You're not forfeiting anything.

22:55.609 --> 22:57.076
- Damn, you're good.

22:57.211 --> 22:59.478
Real good.

22:59.613 --> 23:02.147
Let me see this.
Jeez.

23:02.149 --> 23:03.482
You're the toughest customer
I've ever had.

23:03.617 --> 23:04.884
I'll tell you that right now.

23:05.019 --> 23:06.218
- I think I told you that
before we started.

23:06.354 --> 23:08.287
-
All right, Chief, there you go.

23:08.422 --> 23:09.889
There's your new price.

23:10.024 --> 23:11.357
You should love that number,
then.

23:11.359 --> 23:12.491
- Yes.

23:12.626 --> 23:14.826
Andy...

23:14.962 --> 23:16.362
pleasure doing business
with you.

23:16.364 --> 23:18.230
[both laugh]

23:18.232 --> 23:20.900
- Are you sure you don't want
that stain guard coating?

23:21.035 --> 23:22.768
You know,
with a carpet this light,

23:22.904 --> 23:23.903
it might be
a smart idea, Chief.

23:24.038 --> 23:25.304
- Stop, stop, stop.
Okay?

23:25.439 --> 23:27.839
Go sell some other chump
the stain guard coating.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.174
All right? Dismissed.

23:29.310 --> 23:30.510
- Got it.

23:30.644 --> 23:33.379
Hey, thanks, Johnny.

23:33.514 --> 23:34.714
Ooh, so good, Johnny.

23:34.848 --> 23:35.915
Are you sure
you don't want a coffee?

23:36.050 --> 23:38.117
- How much per yard for that?

23:38.252 --> 23:40.119
[laughter]

23:40.254 --> 23:41.987
- Well, me and the guys
have to head out.

23:42.123 --> 23:44.056
Vicky found out we were
redoing your office

23:44.058 --> 23:47.593
and she hired me to recarpet
your whole house.

23:47.595 --> 23:50.196
- She what?
- Yep.

23:50.331 --> 23:52.998
- [growls]

23:53.134 --> 23:54.667
Damn it!

23:57.271 --> 23:59.705
Fuuuuu!
