That extra-special giant
slithering sea slug

01:31.659 --> 01:32.958
is under sea somewhere.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.294
Right behind you, Horatio!

01:35.296 --> 01:37.329
Hop in my dandy diving bell,

01:37.331 --> 01:38.430
and we'll descend into the deep.

01:38.432 --> 01:43.836
Hmm, you call this old bucket
of bolts a diving bell? Hmm?

01:43.838 --> 01:47.439
No, I call it
a diving beauty!

02:07.394 --> 02:11.997
can stop me from getting a photo
of the rare giant sea slug!

02:11.999 --> 02:13.999
I brought my old camera, too!

02:14.001 --> 02:16.768
It's taken many a fine
fish photo!

02:16.770 --> 02:18.270
Ha! Not like my special

(Shouting, alarm sounding)

02:28.949 --> 02:29.815
Oh, what was that?

02:29.817 --> 02:34.953
Ugh, this feels like being
in the washing machine.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.923
Ahh, jumping jellyfish!
A giant eye!

02:37.925 --> 02:39.258

boisterously like a volleyball.

Whee! What a wild, wacky
whale ride!

03:05.085 --> 03:07.920

03:20.568 --> 03:23.535
Oh, bleu fish!
We are stuck!

03:23.537 --> 03:25.470
That's something
we can agree on.

03:25.472 --> 03:26.872
This bell won't budge.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.006
So, what do we do?

03:28.008 --> 03:30.742
First, we yelp for help!

<i> We got juggled</i>
<i> by a giant whale.</i>

Thanks for hurrying, pups.

04:49.590 --> 04:53.292
Cap'n Turbot and his cousin
François are in trouble.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.294
Cap'n Turbot?
Poor François!

04:55.296 --> 04:58.397
They're out in the bay,
looking for a rare sea slug,

04:58.399 --> 04:59.631
but the playful baby whale

04:59.633 --> 05:02.100
accidentally broke off
the steering fin.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.169
The whale was playing
with the bell

05:04.171 --> 05:06.271
just like we were playing
volleyball!

05:06.273 --> 05:08.340
Now, Cap'n Turbot and François

05:08.342 --> 05:10.976
are stuck at the bottom
of the bay.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.311
For this mission, I'll need...

05:12.313 --> 05:15.013
Zuma, your sub can take us down
to the diving bell,

05:15.015 --> 05:17.549
so we can try to pull it
up to the surface.

05:17.551 --> 05:20.319
My sub? Awesome!

05:20.321 --> 05:22.254

05:22.256 --> 05:25.324
Rocky, I need you and your tools
to repair the diving bell.

05:25.326 --> 05:29.995
You mean, after you and Zuma
get it up to dry land, right?

05:29.997 --> 05:32.364
Well, we'll try to bring it up,
but if we can't,

05:32.366 --> 05:34.333
you'll have to scuba-dive
down there.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.702
Okay! Green means "go"!

05:36.704 --> 05:40.205
Uh, even if it means
"go get wet".

We split our side seam!

08:30.444 --> 08:32.344
The bell will fill up
with water!

08:32.346 --> 08:34.613
We'd better get top-side
and quick!

08:34.615 --> 08:35.780
Oh, no!

08:35.782 --> 08:37.482
I can't steer this thing!

09:10.817 --> 09:12.250
How you doing?

09:12.252 --> 09:13.218
Good.

What are we doing?

09:27.367 --> 09:28.300
Ryder's coming.

09:28.302 --> 09:29.734
We'll just wait for him
to fix the steering.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.604
Hmph! François Turbot
waits for no one!

09:32.606 --> 09:34.806
No, François!
The steering is bro--

Ahhh!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ay-yi-yi!

10:22.489 --> 10:23.088
Wait?

10:23.090 --> 10:25.256

It's the slug!

10:25.258 --> 10:26.758
(Slug giggling)

10:26.760 --> 10:27.692
I got it!

10:27.694 --> 10:30.895

to the surface.

Hey, little whale!

10:37.671 --> 10:41.940
How about you play with me?

10:41.942 --> 10:44.909
Whee!

10:44.911 --> 10:45.844
Whoa!

10:45.846 --> 10:47.746

10:59.393 --> 11:02.794
Ryder, thanks again for bringing
us up from the briny bottom.

11:02.796 --> 11:03.662
No problem!

11:03.664 --> 11:06.531
Whenever you're in trouble,
just yelp for help.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.633
Come see ze fabulous photos

11:08.635 --> 11:12.203
I took of the ze rare giant slug
of ze sea.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.305
Uh, what is that?

11:14.307 --> 11:18.376
Oh, bleu fish!
Zat is my thumb.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.879

Chase.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.554
Let me help.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.922
Thanks, Farmer Yumi!

13:23.470 --> 13:24.736
Nice toss, Chase.

13:24.738 --> 13:26.805
Now, what is wrong
with the chicken coop?

13:26.807 --> 13:30.942
It totally looks like somebody's
been munching on it.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.945
It does look like someone
chewed on the posts.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.880
That's why it fell!

just the chicken coop.

13:44.057 --> 13:47.158
I know who's chewing
on my barn.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.126
Chompy!

13:48.128 --> 13:49.494
PUPS:
Chompy?

13:49.496 --> 13:50.995
The beaver from the pond.

13:50.997 --> 13:54.065
But he never chomped
my buildings before.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.200

13:55.202 --> 13:57.235
I need the PAW Patrol,

Chompy the beaver is eating
the support beams.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.755
We have to save the barn.

Someone has been chewing
Farmers Yumi's barn!

15:07.007 --> 15:10.241
Farmer Yumi thinks
it's Chompy the beaver

15:10.243 --> 15:11.242
that lives in her pond.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.745
We have to make sure
the barn is safe,

chomping on it.

from home.

Let's prop the barn up, fast!

16:55.148 --> 16:58.950
Rubble, Rocky, we need some
long, strong boards

16:58.952 --> 17:00.218
to brace the chewed beams.

17:00.220 --> 17:04.255
There's got to be wood around

17:10.230 --> 17:11.763

It's gone.

18:49.963 --> 18:50.928

Now, gather all the old wood
you can,

19:17.457 --> 19:19.056
and bring it down to the pond.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.392
We're gonna build

19:42.982 --> 19:45.950
But Chompy's been here
the whole time.

19:45.952 --> 19:50.855
Well, someone's chewing his way

19:50.857 --> 19:52.990
It must be another beaver!

19:52.992 --> 19:54.926

20:40.273 --> 20:41.138
"They're"?

20:41.140 --> 20:45.276

21:53.079 --> 21:56.314
(Chittering, smacking tails)

21:56.316 --> 21:58.182
I think they like it.

21:58.184 --> 21:59.450
Beats chewing on an old barn.

21:59.452 --> 22:03.087
Next time, don't go around
chomping things.

22:03.089 --> 22:03.954
Just yelp--

22:03.956 --> 22:06.123
Or slap your tails!

22:06.125 --> 22:07.091
--for help.

22:07.093 --> 22:09.060
(All laughing)

22:09.062 --> 22:11.529
(Chittering)

22:11.531 --> 22:14.799
(Splashing)

22:14.801 --> 22:18.269
The beaver dam
has a waterslide?

22:18.271 --> 22:20.304
Can we try it, Ryder?

22:20.306 --> 22:21.005
Go for it.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.541
You've all been such good pups.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.009
All right!

22:25.011 --> 22:27.111
Whoo-hoo!

22:27.113 --> 22:28.746
(Giggling)

22:28.748 --> 22:31.649
Come on, Rocky.
Let's get wet!

22:31.651 --> 22:32.550
No, thanks!

22:32.552 --> 22:36.320
I'm just going to sit
in the sun.

22:36.322 --> 22:37.688
(Chittering)

22:37.690 --> 22:39.590
Huh?

22:39.592 --> 22:40.491
Whoa!

22:40.493 --> 22:41.625
(Splashing)

22:41.627 --> 22:44.028
Ooh, Chompy!

22:44.030 --> 22:46.263
(Chittering, giggling)
