00:11.333 --> 00:14.000
(ominous music)

00:20.967 --> 00:22.367
(man howls)

00:22.367 --> 00:25.967
- [Narrator] Wild,
savage, and unstoppable.

00:29.767 --> 00:31.900
The north's Berserker warriors

00:31.900 --> 00:34.467
are almost more beast than man.

00:37.233 --> 00:39.433
(men growling)

00:39.433 --> 00:43.133
They feel no pain or
fear like animals.

00:43.133 --> 00:44.633
(somber music)

00:44.633 --> 00:47.467
They can enter a rageful trance.

00:51.533 --> 00:54.533
While in this trance,
they believe themselves

00:54.533 --> 00:56.367
to be unstoppable.

00:57.433 --> 01:00.233
(woman screaming)

01:03.933 --> 01:06.900
They're described to
be almost possessed

01:06.900 --> 01:09.067
while in this state.

01:09.067 --> 01:11.667
(tense music)

01:13.067 --> 01:16.067
In the land of the Vikings
on the Shetland Isles,

01:16.067 --> 01:18.900
two battles have been
fought for many years

01:18.900 --> 01:22.667
between the Berserkers
and Vikings.

01:22.667 --> 01:25.833
The Berserkers are led
by their leader Snorre

01:25.833 --> 01:30.600
whose throne is succeeded
by his sons Steiner

01:30.600 --> 01:35.533
who has fought many
battles and youngest Rolf

01:35.533 --> 01:36.833
who has yet to fight.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.867
(Gunner pants)

01:45.567 --> 01:49.267
- I will use your bones
to pick at my teeth.

01:49.267 --> 01:51.867
- [Narrator] A game has be
granted by the Berserkers.

01:56.667 --> 01:58.167
(women grunting)

01:58.167 --> 02:02.300
That, if the Vikings are
able to fight to the death,

02:05.467 --> 02:09.133
but survive their match,
they are to walk free

02:10.067 --> 02:10.833
and be free.

02:12.833 --> 02:16.467
No Viking has lived to
prove this promise correct

02:19.067 --> 02:20.600
until now.
- Father.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.700
(tense somber music)

02:37.767 --> 02:42.767
(men grunting)
(swords clanging)

02:56.933 --> 03:01.433
- Ah, Olav, put down your
sword and come to thy death.

03:03.733 --> 03:08.067
- I have no fear in my bones,
no fury for you, Snorre.

03:09.167 --> 03:13.567
I want peace and I
wish for you to leave.

03:13.567 --> 03:14.867
I wish for no battle.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.867
- (chuckles) No fury?

03:21.267 --> 03:25.233
Well, that is something you
must find in your bones,

03:26.533 --> 03:28.667
if you wish to survive, brother.

03:31.233 --> 03:32.967
(spits)

03:32.967 --> 03:35.567
(Snorre pants)

03:38.967 --> 03:42.500
- My men will take your children

03:42.500 --> 03:45.300
and what's left of your family.

03:47.067 --> 03:50.667
I shall be the one
to command them,

03:50.667 --> 03:52.267
to fight my people.

03:54.133 --> 03:57.300
All will have a fair
chance and no game.

03:59.433 --> 04:01.967
- Get off our land, vulture.

04:13.067 --> 04:14.433
- Oh, what a beauty you have.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.233
I should take this beauty

04:23.500 --> 04:27.900
and consider it
(sniffs) for myself.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.667
- Do not touch my wife.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.200
(tense emotional music)

04:35.200 --> 04:36.067
- Easy, Olav.

04:38.433 --> 04:42.167
You wish to at least make
it to the battlegrounds.

04:43.333 --> 04:46.200
Now tell me, where
are your daughters?

04:50.200 --> 04:54.067
(laughs) Put that sword down.

04:56.100 --> 04:59.267
Or what is it that
you will do with this?

05:00.567 --> 05:01.900
You have a sword,

05:04.067 --> 05:05.800
I have my bare hands.

05:06.833 --> 05:08.667
Ah, I shall still win.

05:10.167 --> 05:11.167
- Father.

05:11.167 --> 05:12.067
- Hey.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.800
- Don't worry, boy,

05:17.533 --> 05:20.367
we shall have our
fun with this one,

05:21.333 --> 05:23.833
and when we find the daughters

05:25.067 --> 05:27.133
we will have even more fun.

05:27.133 --> 05:28.533
- [Woman] Oh fattah.

05:28.533 --> 05:29.367
- Won't we men?

05:29.367 --> 05:31.967
(men laughing)

05:37.267 --> 05:40.533
Now, tell me, where
are your daughters?

05:43.067 --> 05:45.200
- I will never answer you.

05:46.467 --> 05:50.400
- I think there are ways
to make you answer me.

05:54.867 --> 05:57.067
(panting)

06:00.067 --> 06:01.067
Men, women,

06:05.733 --> 06:09.167
we are to have our fun.
(tense music)

06:09.167 --> 06:12.500
(Berserkers chattering)

06:22.533 --> 06:25.633
(Berserkers howling)

06:29.067 --> 06:30.767
Let the battle begin!

06:32.800 --> 06:35.733
(Berserkers shouting)

06:35.733 --> 06:37.267
(dramatic tense music)

06:37.267 --> 06:39.533
(men grunting)

06:39.533 --> 06:42.133
(men growling)

07:01.600 --> 07:04.633
(men shouting)
(swords clanging)

07:04.633 --> 07:07.467
(people grunting)

07:18.767 --> 07:20.767
(man shouting)
(swords clanging)

07:20.767 --> 07:25.767
- Stop!
(men and women grunting)

07:54.800 --> 07:58.300
(swords clanging)

07:58.300 --> 08:01.167
(people grunting)

08:06.400 --> 08:09.067
(woman screams)

08:13.867 --> 08:15.600
(dynamic music)

08:15.600 --> 08:20.600
(woman grunting)
(swords clanging)

08:27.367 --> 08:32.366
(men grunting)
(swords clanging)

08:49.233 --> 08:51.833
(man grunting)

08:52.700 --> 08:55.867
(Magnus growling)

08:55.867 --> 08:58.467
(men grunting)

09:00.067 --> 09:03.067
(Berserker shouting)

09:04.333 --> 09:07.667
(women panting)

09:07.667 --> 09:08.900
- [Leif] Go on.

09:17.167 --> 09:18.067
(swords clanging)

09:18.067 --> 09:19.933
- [Man] Gunner!

09:19.933 --> 09:22.500
(men shouting)

09:24.933 --> 09:27.500
(men grunting)

09:33.467 --> 09:34.900
(Steiner shouts)

09:34.900 --> 09:37.600
(moving to tense music)

09:37.600 --> 09:40.200
(men grunting)

09:43.567 --> 09:44.400
(woman wails)

09:44.400 --> 09:47.233
(Steiner gagging)

09:49.233 --> 09:54.233
- Stop!
(woman screams)

10:02.033 --> 10:04.800
(Snorre panting)

10:21.133 --> 10:22.633
- Steiner, my son,

10:26.200 --> 10:27.800
you have failed me.

10:28.800 --> 10:29.633
- Father.

10:32.133 --> 10:36.400
- (pants) But you
will be avenged.

10:44.967 --> 10:47.767
(Rolf whimpering)

10:56.200 --> 10:57.733
Save him for me.

10:59.633 --> 11:01.533
I shall take his life.

11:03.067 --> 11:05.933
I shall make your
family die first,

11:08.400 --> 11:11.333
build the range inside you,

11:11.333 --> 11:14.667
then I will kill you
with my bare hands!

11:16.067 --> 11:18.667
(somber music)

11:50.967 --> 11:52.900
- [Astrid] Brother,
we must find food.

11:54.833 --> 11:56.567
- We should keep
marching forward.

11:58.967 --> 12:00.700
- Sister, come.

12:00.700 --> 12:03.967
- Brother, sister, I'm scared.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.667
Scared for our lives.

12:12.767 --> 12:15.367
I do not have the strength
inside my heart to go on.

12:16.967 --> 12:19.600
They has taken
everything from us,

12:19.600 --> 12:23.067
our homes, our
families, our parents.

12:24.467 --> 12:25.300
It's all gone.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.633
- We have each other
and we have family.

12:35.467 --> 12:40.367
We'll find hope and that will
bring us a positive future.

12:42.567 --> 12:43.733
- All is but lost.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.967
We do have the strength to
live in happiness again.

12:48.967 --> 12:51.067
- I don't see how, brother.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.767
Sister, I don't see how.

12:55.733 --> 12:59.067
- We will stop for a
while, find food, rest up,

13:00.467 --> 13:03.133
then we'll find the
energy to continue, come.

13:09.067 --> 13:11.633
(somber music)

13:20.800 --> 13:24.600
- Listen, everything
has changed.

13:24.600 --> 13:28.500
Steiner is slain, now
they have escaped.

13:28.500 --> 13:32.200
If they got to the
west, we have them.

13:32.200 --> 13:35.933
We have control, we
will have our vengeance.

13:35.933 --> 13:40.933
(horse hooves clomping)
(tense music)

13:44.667 --> 13:48.467
- Berserkers, Snorre has an
announcement, stand forth.

13:50.500 --> 13:55.400
- A man has fallen
today, only one.

13:57.200 --> 14:02.167
You have taken their family,
and spilt the blood of many.

14:03.533 --> 14:08.133
- Steiner was our brother,
and shall be missed.

14:09.300 --> 14:11.200
- Brothers do not
lose any battle.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.767
He was a false brother, Ivar.

14:14.767 --> 14:18.333
- Steiner was no brother to you.

14:18.333 --> 14:22.133
- The brother was weak, frail
to lose a battle such as this.

14:25.067 --> 14:27.333
- I am not to give
praise to your bother?

14:29.133 --> 14:30.667
He was close to you,

14:31.633 --> 14:34.467
but he was weak.

14:36.533 --> 14:41.167
- Knut, Ivar, Olav's son

14:41.167 --> 14:44.467
and daughters have escaped us.

14:45.333 --> 14:46.967
- Shall I search for them?

14:46.967 --> 14:50.600
- Find them, bring
them to the fields.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.067
(ominous music)

14:52.067 --> 14:54.067
I wish to see them fight.

14:54.067 --> 14:57.233
Olav's boy will fight my son.

14:59.167 --> 15:02.167
To the death fields we shall go.

15:03.067 --> 15:06.800
(moving to dark tense music)

15:13.733 --> 15:17.167
(moving to somber music)

15:19.200 --> 15:20.367
- We found it.

15:21.967 --> 15:25.133
We're here (panting).

15:32.067 --> 15:33.400
Sigrunn, Sigrunn.

15:39.533 --> 15:40.700
- My children.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.800
(panting)

15:44.800 --> 15:45.833
Can it be you're here?

15:45.833 --> 15:46.667
You're alive!

15:46.667 --> 15:47.867
Surely not.

15:47.867 --> 15:49.500
- This is what you see,
we stand before you.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.200
- Your faces bring
me so much joy.

15:52.467 --> 15:53.900
- Nothing to fear.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.800
(panting)

15:55.800 --> 15:56.800
We traveled alone.

16:00.067 --> 16:01.333
- Alone?

16:01.333 --> 16:03.400
- We had no choice but
to leave our homes.

16:06.667 --> 16:07.533
- My sisters?

16:09.600 --> 16:13.467
- The Berserk, they
had ruled our land now.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.667
We were the only but
the last to survive.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.900
(panting)

16:23.767 --> 16:26.167
- Our mother and father,
they forced us to flee.

16:27.667 --> 16:29.633
They thought it maybe
a way we would survive.

16:29.633 --> 16:31.100
(somber music)

16:31.100 --> 16:34.133
They advised us to hide
here with you in the castle.

16:34.133 --> 16:37.433
- The castle, it's not safe.

16:37.433 --> 16:39.700
It's not safe here, I
can't offer you safety.

16:41.733 --> 16:42.567
- Sigrunn.

16:43.833 --> 16:45.133
- The Berserkers they came

16:46.333 --> 16:47.933
and in their sick
and twisted minds,

16:47.933 --> 16:49.067
they treated us like animals

16:49.067 --> 16:51.200
and they forced us to fight.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.433
(panting)

16:55.367 --> 16:56.300
But you must go.

16:56.300 --> 16:59.200
- Sigrunn, you must follow us!

17:00.667 --> 17:02.200
- I can't.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.233
There is nothing here
left for me to fight for.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.467
- Sigrunn, you must come please.

17:07.467 --> 17:09.700
- There is no fight
left in me, Ingrid.

17:10.867 --> 17:13.433
I have no fire in
my fight at all.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.300
They've taken everything,
they've taken my family.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.133
Now you must go.

17:19.067 --> 17:20.367
You must go now.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.900
(panting) Go.

17:43.167 --> 17:44.667
- [Loki] Get down!

17:48.300 --> 17:49.300
- [Woman] Go away.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.733
- [Man] Yes, mum.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.867
- Do you think our
children have fled safely?

17:56.867 --> 17:58.333
- I have confidence in them.

17:58.333 --> 18:00.733
- They must have found
themselves with Sigrunn.

18:00.733 --> 18:02.500
She will protect them.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.400
You can hold out
safely at the castle.

18:05.433 --> 18:07.067
- Hold out at the castle safely?

18:08.900 --> 18:11.200
Do you speak of Turmrig Castle?

18:12.067 --> 18:12.867
- We do.

18:14.567 --> 18:16.633
(laughs)

18:18.067 --> 18:19.600
- Why do you laugh at this?

18:19.600 --> 18:23.067
- No safety at Turmrig
Castle, nay safety at all.

18:23.067 --> 18:25.933
- Your bitter tongue
may say these things,

18:25.933 --> 18:29.100
but our sister she has men
that can demolish your family.

18:29.100 --> 18:32.800
- Everyone at Turmrig
Castle is slain.

18:32.800 --> 18:36.100
Not one of thou survived
their battle in the field.

18:36.100 --> 18:40.500
I watched on and no one
survived their battle.

18:40.500 --> 18:41.333
- You lie.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.600
- I do not.

18:48.133 --> 18:50.267
- Our sister and a man
with spoke with yesterday,

18:50.267 --> 18:51.767
they were prepared for battle.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.967
- Indeed, they
thought they were,

18:56.467 --> 18:58.767
but where dost thou think this
blood on me has come from?

18:58.767 --> 19:00.700
- Why do you support this?

19:01.833 --> 19:02.967
You're not one of them.

19:04.433 --> 19:05.700
Your family must have been
slain, brutally murdered,

19:05.700 --> 19:06.633
just as ours.

19:06.633 --> 19:07.767
Why does thee support this?

19:09.067 --> 19:11.600
- My family fought,
my family were weak.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.233
I have a new family now,

19:14.233 --> 19:16.300
that is that of the Berserker.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.067
- He will kill you eventually.

19:20.300 --> 19:21.567
You're not blood,

19:21.567 --> 19:23.133
he owes you nothing.

19:23.133 --> 19:25.300
He will not be faithful to you.

19:28.533 --> 19:29.433
- Have a good day.

19:32.233 --> 19:33.667
Good luck on the battlefield.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.433
(birds chirping)

19:48.767 --> 19:51.267
- I have no fear that
they will be caught.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.800
- (chuckles) And when they are,

19:54.800 --> 19:56.367
we will have our fun (laughs).

20:01.633 --> 20:02.467
- Rolf, time.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.033
Men, leave us.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.267
- [Rolf] How are you, father?

20:16.267 --> 20:19.467
- Rolf, wash the blood from me.

20:25.233 --> 20:28.067
Is there love in
your heart, Rolf?

20:29.100 --> 20:30.100
- Of course.

20:33.633 --> 20:37.067
- Is there love in
your heart for family?

20:40.400 --> 20:42.100
- The love runs
deep for my family.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.900
- So why do you not kill for me?

20:53.667 --> 20:57.700
Rolf, my son, you are yet to
take a life with your hands.

20:59.167 --> 21:00.700
- That couldn't be further
from the truth, Father.

21:02.167 --> 21:04.667
I have killed men with
my bare hands many times.

21:06.067 --> 21:07.567
- Don't lie to me, Rolf.

21:09.300 --> 21:10.733
For when you lie to family,

21:12.100 --> 21:14.200
your tongue shall
be taken from you.

21:15.867 --> 21:16.700
Understand?

21:18.267 --> 21:19.100
- Yes, Father.

21:21.333 --> 21:24.067
- I believe, you have my blood

21:25.700 --> 21:27.167
running through your veins

21:29.200 --> 21:32.167
but I do not see myself in you.

21:34.133 --> 21:37.733
No leader, no beast within you.

21:39.933 --> 21:41.800
Oh, your strength is nothing

21:42.800 --> 21:44.433
if you choose not to use it.

21:44.433 --> 21:47.067
- [Rolf] I will use my strength,
when the time is right.

21:48.367 --> 21:50.233
- And is the time right now?

21:50.233 --> 21:51.167
- What do you mean?

21:53.067 --> 21:55.667
- To battle in the fields?

21:57.600 --> 21:58.933
- I'm not a beast.

22:00.333 --> 22:02.067
I may lose a battle
in the fields.

22:04.233 --> 22:08.333
- A son of mine would
have no fear of this,

22:09.700 --> 22:11.400
no thought of losing.

22:11.400 --> 22:14.067
(somber music)

22:19.900 --> 22:22.067
Bring through the anger.

22:22.067 --> 22:23.133
Show me the beast.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.700
(Rolf screams)

22:24.700 --> 22:25.533
Show me!

22:26.667 --> 22:27.967
Show me.

22:27.967 --> 22:30.733
(Rolf grunts)

22:30.733 --> 22:31.767
Yes, show me.

22:31.767 --> 22:34.333
(Rolf panting)

22:40.633 --> 22:41.467
Ach!

22:47.067 --> 22:48.600
Shall I make it?

22:48.600 --> 22:51.400
Will you battle
in the next fight?

22:54.633 --> 22:55.767
Join me, come.

23:04.067 --> 23:07.267
(tense dramatic music)

23:09.100 --> 23:12.433
(Ivar and Knut howling)

23:48.933 --> 23:51.500
- Do you think they
would have survived,

23:51.500 --> 23:52.633
escaped the Berserkers?

23:54.067 --> 23:56.567
- Father wouldn't let a
thing happen to our mother.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.467
- He would not let
anything happen.

24:01.467 --> 24:03.167
But he is not always in control.

24:08.067 --> 24:09.767
What if they are dead?

24:09.767 --> 24:10.700
- Ingrid (panting),

24:13.833 --> 24:15.800
we have no way of knowing.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.667
All we can do is as they asked.

24:18.933 --> 24:20.700
They gave their lives for us.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.267
They wanted us to survive this.

24:24.400 --> 24:29.100
They made us flee to
survive, to have a life.

24:30.967 --> 24:33.100
- They have given
everything for our lives.

24:35.700 --> 24:38.300
(sighs)

24:38.300 --> 24:39.900
I want to go back for them.

24:39.900 --> 24:42.233
- No, we mustn't.

24:43.933 --> 24:48.933
No turning back, only forward.

24:50.733 --> 24:54.900
- Brother, all we
know of has changed.

24:58.267 --> 24:59.767
Everything we know of is gone.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.067
It is no more.

25:05.167 --> 25:06.900
This world is
anything but happy.

25:08.633 --> 25:11.767
I shan't think we will
find happiness anymore.

25:11.767 --> 25:12.867
Not in this world.

25:14.367 --> 25:15.667
Even if we seek it.

25:18.633 --> 25:19.967
All we have is rage.

25:23.533 --> 25:25.433
(sighs) Rage for revenge.

25:35.300 --> 25:38.067
(ominous music)

26:01.967 --> 26:03.133
- This one.

26:03.133 --> 26:06.567
(Torrun and Siv panting)

26:09.267 --> 26:10.433
- [Torrun] No!

26:13.333 --> 26:16.133
- [Siv] No, no, no (panting).

26:16.133 --> 26:16.967
(Siv screams)

26:16.967 --> 26:17.867
No, Mother!

26:18.833 --> 26:20.500
- Leave her, leave her be.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.400
(Siv cries)

26:21.400 --> 26:22.733
- Let me go!

26:22.733 --> 26:24.267
- Siv!

26:24.267 --> 26:26.967
Stop this, stop.

26:26.967 --> 26:28.333
Siv.

26:28.333 --> 26:30.100
(man laughing)

26:30.100 --> 26:30.900
- Hut.

26:32.533 --> 26:33.400
(man laughs)

26:33.400 --> 26:36.067
(Siv cries)

26:36.067 --> 26:39.567
- [Siv] No, please
don't (screams).

26:39.567 --> 26:42.667
- Shall I release
her matter, Snorre?

26:47.333 --> 26:48.400
- Let Gunner out.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.300
- Gunner (laughs).

26:53.800 --> 26:55.900
- She's no match for Gunner.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.333
Let me fight her.

27:01.500 --> 27:04.400
- You shall fight
your battle soon.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.967
(man laughing)
(Siv crying)

27:20.967 --> 27:23.467
(Siv panting)

27:31.600 --> 27:32.767
(Gunner grunts)

27:32.767 --> 27:34.567
(man laughs)

27:34.567 --> 27:36.067
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:36.067 --> 27:38.500
(man howling)

27:38.500 --> 27:43.500
- Go on!
(man laughs evilly)

27:44.933 --> 27:47.800
(Gunner growls)

27:47.800 --> 27:49.133
(Gunner laughs)

27:49.133 --> 27:51.800
(Gunner growls)

28:07.200 --> 28:10.267
- I'm sorry, my
sweet, but not today.

28:19.633 --> 28:21.133
- She has no sword.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.167
She has no way to survive.

28:23.167 --> 28:24.733
This fight is not fair (cries).

28:26.533 --> 28:27.867
- Throw her a sword.

28:31.867 --> 28:34.700
(Gunner growling)

28:36.767 --> 28:39.267
(Siv panting)

28:57.600 --> 29:01.167
(Siv and Gunner grunting)

29:08.900 --> 29:10.333
- Oh, yeah, yeah!

29:12.100 --> 29:13.133
- Go on.

29:13.133 --> 29:13.967
- No!

29:22.567 --> 29:24.967
(Siv grunts)

29:24.967 --> 29:26.633
- There is my sweet.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.367
(Siv grunts)

29:30.367 --> 29:33.067
(Gunner grunts)

29:34.933 --> 29:37.267
(Siv cries)

29:43.433 --> 29:46.067
(men whooping)

29:49.967 --> 29:52.133
- Go on, take it, take it.

29:53.467 --> 29:54.600
Hide!

29:54.600 --> 29:56.167
- [Man] Yes!

29:56.167 --> 29:57.800
- [Gunner] Oh, now.

29:57.800 --> 29:58.733
(men shouting)

29:58.733 --> 30:01.400
(Gunner laughs)

30:03.567 --> 30:06.233
(Gunner growls)

30:07.600 --> 30:10.367
(Gunner panting)

30:12.200 --> 30:13.433
- Say bye bye.

30:13.433 --> 30:15.033
- No!

30:15.033 --> 30:17.433
Siv (cries)!

30:19.133 --> 30:22.800
(men shouting and growling)

30:23.900 --> 30:26.900
- I'll make you fight
the next battle.

30:28.367 --> 30:30.900
I shall keep it easy.

30:30.900 --> 30:33.467
You'll fight the lady.

30:33.467 --> 30:37.133
(men grunting and shouting)

30:38.867 --> 30:39.667
- Yeah!

30:41.767 --> 30:43.100
(Gunner grunts)

30:43.100 --> 30:45.833
(screams)

30:45.833 --> 30:48.300
- No (cries).

30:50.600 --> 30:51.567
- Yes, yeah!

30:53.467 --> 30:55.933
- No (cries).

30:56.900 --> 30:59.500
(Gunner grunts)

30:59.500 --> 31:01.767
(men growling)

31:01.767 --> 31:03.233
- Move, move.

31:03.233 --> 31:07.500
(Berserkers laughing
and shouting)

31:17.400 --> 31:20.133
(pigeons cooing)

31:23.700 --> 31:26.300
(men shouting)

31:30.867 --> 31:32.267
- Who goes there?

31:45.400 --> 31:47.633
(panting and crying)

31:47.633 --> 31:50.100
(tense music)

32:07.233 --> 32:09.500
Soon I shall be by thy side.

32:17.833 --> 32:20.767
(leaves crunching)

32:25.800 --> 32:27.067
Who goes there?

32:31.267 --> 32:32.900
Answer me!

32:32.900 --> 32:34.167
Who goes there?

32:39.600 --> 32:42.167
- Thou cannot get away so easy.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.800
- Where are your family?

33:10.100 --> 33:12.167
Which direction did they part?

33:16.533 --> 33:18.933
- Thou shall not
answer such a question.

33:23.067 --> 33:24.400
- I'm hungry, brother.

33:26.933 --> 33:28.167
Shall we feast?

33:43.067 --> 33:44.267
Shall we feast?

33:48.367 --> 33:49.200
Help us.

33:50.167 --> 33:51.100
Our family.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.700
- She smells good.

34:02.067 --> 34:02.900
Feast.

34:02.900 --> 34:03.833
(Sigrunn cries)

34:03.833 --> 34:04.800
- No.
- My dear.

34:04.800 --> 34:08.467
- No, no, no, no (screams).

34:11.300 --> 34:13.067
(screams)

34:13.067 --> 34:15.833
(Sigrunn screams)

34:16.766 --> 34:18.167
- [Sigrunn] Help!

34:21.467 --> 34:22.300
Help me!

34:26.632 --> 34:27.467
Help me!

34:35.400 --> 34:37.199
- I'm not like them.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.733
I have Berserk blood but
my mind is different.

34:43.733 --> 34:45.300
- Leave us be.

34:45.300 --> 34:47.266
- My father wants
me to fight thee,

34:47.266 --> 34:49.132
but I will not do it.

34:49.132 --> 34:50.967
I don't want any
part in this battle.

34:52.067 --> 34:52.900
- You lie.

34:54.233 --> 34:56.300
- I would do no such thing.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.233
- You is the son of a monster.

34:58.233 --> 35:00.467
Demon blood resides inside him,

35:00.467 --> 35:01.600
fury like no other.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.400
You has that blood.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.267
- I has that bad blood,

35:04.267 --> 35:07.400
but my thoughts are different.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.467
They're not the same.

35:09.933 --> 35:10.833
I will not fight.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.100
- What do you propose?

35:16.100 --> 35:17.600
- I propose that
you flee this area

35:17.600 --> 35:20.267
as quick as humanly possible
before the battle begins.

35:21.633 --> 35:22.467
Come.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.833
I do not wish to reside
in this area any longer.

35:33.200 --> 35:36.800
(Snorre and Turid moaning)

35:43.833 --> 35:46.667
(Snorre grunting)

35:50.233 --> 35:52.800
(both panting)

36:24.500 --> 36:27.300
- When will you let me fight?

36:27.300 --> 36:29.633
- Soon, soon you will fight.

36:34.200 --> 36:35.733
- With whom?

36:35.733 --> 36:37.800
- I have a plan for this.

36:39.733 --> 36:40.567
- Do tell.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.200
- I grow tired of Vigdis.

36:44.567 --> 36:47.333
I wish to have a new wife.

36:50.900 --> 36:53.267
- And what if I don't
want to be your wife?

36:54.633 --> 36:55.600
- You will.

36:56.833 --> 37:00.067
- (chuckles) You have
a confident soul.

37:01.133 --> 37:02.800
You should protect that soul.

37:04.100 --> 37:06.233
You can't always
get what you want.

37:07.533 --> 37:09.567
- I always get what I desire.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.133
- You wish to make
your wife and mistress

37:17.133 --> 37:18.400
fight to the death?

37:20.400 --> 37:24.767
- Yeah, she has a
fiery soul (panting).

37:30.067 --> 37:32.167
- I have fire in my soul.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.633
You filled my soul full of fire

37:35.633 --> 37:37.733
when you burned down my town.

37:39.533 --> 37:40.600
- I spared you.

37:41.900 --> 37:44.667
You have better energies

37:44.667 --> 37:46.833
than anyone I have ever known.

37:52.900 --> 37:53.733
- Snorre!

37:55.100 --> 37:56.467
Sir, may I enter?

37:57.300 --> 37:59.200
- What is it Siguard?

37:59.200 --> 38:00.800
(Siguard panting)

38:00.800 --> 38:01.833
- Your son.

38:03.333 --> 38:04.333
- What of him?

38:04.333 --> 38:06.067
- He's escaped, sir.

38:06.067 --> 38:08.100
- He's escaped and
taken the lady.

38:08.100 --> 38:10.067
- And you saw this?

38:10.067 --> 38:12.233
- He sent me away.

38:12.233 --> 38:16.733
- And you let him go?

38:16.733 --> 38:17.700
And you?

38:17.700 --> 38:20.067
- It was not my doing.

38:20.067 --> 38:21.133
It was Siguard.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.633
- Find him.

38:25.833 --> 38:27.567
Find him and bring him here

38:28.733 --> 38:31.233
or else you shall
lose your head.

38:31.233 --> 38:32.500
- I will find him.

38:33.867 --> 38:36.067
- He shall be gone too
far into the woods.

38:36.933 --> 38:38.267
You shall do no such thing.

38:40.133 --> 38:42.333
- Then we shall have
to play with you, Olav,

38:43.400 --> 38:44.733
until they return.

38:44.733 --> 38:46.133
(Loki laughing)

38:46.133 --> 38:48.967
(Ragnor chuckles)

39:03.133 --> 39:06.867
- (panting) I cannot
keep up with that energy.

39:06.867 --> 39:08.800
My bones run weak.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.700
I have no energy,

39:10.700 --> 39:13.867
no food within me, no water.

39:15.700 --> 39:17.900
- There is no time for stopping.

39:17.900 --> 39:19.600
We need to keep going.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.333
We need to find your
children and tell them

39:21.333 --> 39:23.800
that the Berserkers
are after them.

39:23.800 --> 39:28.800
- (panting) Why does
you do this for us?

39:29.533 --> 39:30.700
What's in it for thee?

39:32.267 --> 39:34.167
Answer, be truthful.

39:34.167 --> 39:35.367
Why?

39:35.367 --> 39:37.600
(panting)

39:39.067 --> 39:43.833
- I do this, I do this
because I am the wrong son

39:44.433 --> 39:45.167
born to Snorre.

39:46.700 --> 39:49.333
I despise him and
his every action.

39:51.733 --> 39:52.633
- Why else?

39:58.867 --> 40:01.067
My daughter, Ingrid?

40:04.400 --> 40:06.167
- I have passion for her, yes.

40:07.667 --> 40:09.867
- A passion, a lust?

40:12.500 --> 40:13.600
- I see your family,

40:15.100 --> 40:18.700
your daughter, and I want that.

40:19.800 --> 40:20.967
I want that happiness,

40:22.400 --> 40:24.633
not the darkness and
despair that I've known.

40:27.167 --> 40:29.733
- My daughter could
never be with a person

40:29.733 --> 40:30.800
of Berserkers' blood.

40:37.067 --> 40:40.233
- Come on, we need
to keep moving.

40:40.233 --> 40:43.100
(tense music)

40:43.100 --> 40:46.067
(stones clattering)

40:55.567 --> 40:57.233
- How far must we
walk for safety?

40:58.267 --> 41:02.200
- As far as we can, days, weeks.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.300
We must go and not stop.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.067
- As soon as we reach
the next village,

41:09.067 --> 41:10.833
we will seek safety.

41:10.833 --> 41:12.933
- For how long, until
the Berserkers come?

41:16.367 --> 41:17.767
- Time will tell.

41:37.067 --> 41:38.633
- Preparing for a fight?

41:39.833 --> 41:41.233
- Why do you say that?

41:43.600 --> 41:44.800
- You paint white.

41:46.333 --> 41:48.767
Only those who enter into
battle do such a thing.

41:49.767 --> 41:52.400
- No, this is uniform.

41:53.433 --> 41:54.933
- Uniform does not exist here.

41:56.067 --> 41:58.233
You are preparing for a fight.

41:58.233 --> 41:59.167
I'm sure of it.

42:03.067 --> 42:04.300
Who are you going against?

42:07.067 --> 42:09.900
- Well, we'll see,

42:11.500 --> 42:12.500
we'll see.

42:12.500 --> 42:15.067
(tense music)

42:35.467 --> 42:38.067
(Torrun cries)

42:41.400 --> 42:43.333
- Your family did this.

42:44.633 --> 42:46.900
Both thy sisters gone.

42:50.567 --> 42:53.300
Your family, monsters,
they did this!

42:56.333 --> 42:58.300
(cries)

43:08.367 --> 43:09.467
- I am sorry.

43:12.167 --> 43:13.067
I am sorry.

43:15.500 --> 43:16.900
My hideous family's actions

43:16.900 --> 43:19.333
do not represent mine, lady.

43:22.367 --> 43:25.200
(Torrun panting)

43:31.067 --> 43:33.467
I'm sorry for the actions
of my family to yours.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.233
- You are just like them.

43:40.600 --> 43:43.700
You might stand, talk confident

43:43.700 --> 43:45.067
as though thee means well,

43:46.067 --> 43:48.167
as thou wants my family peace.

43:48.167 --> 43:50.100
You stand there and you watch

43:50.100 --> 43:52.667
while your family
is murdering mine.

43:52.667 --> 43:54.233
You watch!

43:54.233 --> 43:55.833
- I will watch no longer.

43:57.167 --> 43:59.067
(stone thuds)

43:59.067 --> 44:00.800
- What was that sound?

44:00.800 --> 44:02.767
- Nothing but an animal.

44:08.600 --> 44:09.433
- Animal.

44:10.900 --> 44:13.500
(tense music)

44:14.933 --> 44:17.533
You used the correct
word, animal.

44:18.967 --> 44:19.800
I am.

44:21.400 --> 44:23.233
(sword clangs) No fear.

44:23.233 --> 44:26.300
My brother has gone to
fetch your daughter.

44:27.500 --> 44:30.267
Now, what are you
doing here, Rolf?

44:33.633 --> 44:34.800
(Rolf and Ivar grunting)

44:34.800 --> 44:38.067
(dramatic tense music)

44:40.200 --> 44:43.567
(swords clanging)

44:43.567 --> 44:45.900
- You fight a good
one for someone

44:45.900 --> 44:48.100
to have never stepped
into the death fields.

44:50.067 --> 44:52.900
- I watch, I learn.

44:52.900 --> 44:53.733
- Now you die.

44:56.467 --> 44:58.800
(Ivar grunts)

44:58.800 --> 45:00.667
- What would my
father say if he knew

45:00.667 --> 45:02.067
you were gonna kill me?

45:02.067 --> 45:05.233
- With me, his son,
replaceable, human.

45:05.233 --> 45:07.333
- He would take your life.

45:07.333 --> 45:09.067
(dramatic music)

45:09.067 --> 45:10.867
- A traitor!

45:10.867 --> 45:13.133
I better say this otherwise.

45:13.133 --> 45:15.567
Look who's in here is a traitor,

45:15.567 --> 45:18.433
protecting a woman
with different blood.

45:18.433 --> 45:20.667
- I protect what I believe.

45:22.533 --> 45:27.533
(both grunting)
(swords clanging)

45:43.800 --> 45:46.567
(Torrun shouts)

45:46.567 --> 45:49.433
- Your blood means nothing.

45:49.433 --> 45:50.767
We are the same.

45:51.867 --> 45:53.600
- We're not the same.

46:01.333 --> 46:03.867
(Ivar grunts)

46:03.867 --> 46:05.833
(Torrun shouts)

46:05.833 --> 46:08.767
(emotional music)

46:23.167 --> 46:24.500
- Goodbye, Ivar.

46:49.500 --> 46:52.133
I don't know who I am.

46:52.133 --> 46:53.567
Am I one of them?

46:54.700 --> 46:56.367
- Nothing like them.

46:58.067 --> 47:00.733
Thee was right, you
are more than blood.

47:01.767 --> 47:03.333
You are a good man.

47:09.433 --> 47:12.300
- Blood, we need to protect you.

47:12.300 --> 47:13.700
- What's done is done.

47:15.467 --> 47:18.067
You must continue with your
fight, with your energy.

47:19.233 --> 47:22.867
Go, save my children, warn them.

47:22.867 --> 47:23.700
(dramatic music)

47:23.700 --> 47:25.100
- I shan't leave you.

47:25.100 --> 47:26.933
- They have no knowledge
what come for them,

47:26.933 --> 47:28.333
they have no weapons.

47:29.533 --> 47:30.467
Go, please!

47:33.267 --> 47:35.367
- I'm sorry you won't
see me protect them.

47:37.733 --> 47:42.367
- I'm sorry, I could not
see you for a different man.

47:42.367 --> 47:44.100
You are no Berserker.

47:51.533 --> 47:52.367
Go!

47:54.100 --> 47:58.333
I wish your last memory of
me shall not be of this.

47:59.233 --> 48:01.133
I prefer to die alone.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.067
Please go!

48:05.367 --> 48:07.267
- I will save them!

48:07.267 --> 48:08.433
- I trust you.

48:09.967 --> 48:12.533
Now, go and do good work by me.

48:47.500 --> 48:48.333
- Snorre.

48:50.067 --> 48:54.067
- Vigdis, oh you have
been silent with me.

48:56.333 --> 48:59.967
Why, why?
(somber music)

48:59.967 --> 49:01.700
- I have been with my thoughts,

49:06.633 --> 49:07.733
lost in them.

49:11.500 --> 49:13.667
- What thoughts are these?

49:17.300 --> 49:19.800
- Thoughts of what is to come.

49:22.900 --> 49:24.300
Thoughts for me.

49:28.733 --> 49:30.633
- What do you worry of?

49:36.700 --> 49:38.167
- You promised me love.

49:40.067 --> 49:40.900
- [Snorre] Yes.

49:42.500 --> 49:45.367
- But the love that was before,

49:45.367 --> 49:47.067
does not seem to remain.

49:50.333 --> 49:52.067
- Why do you say such things?

49:53.067 --> 49:54.667
Questioning my love?

49:58.400 --> 50:00.567
- It is not for me to question,

50:01.600 --> 50:03.400
but for me to observe,

50:03.400 --> 50:05.667
what is happening
to your thoughts.

50:08.067 --> 50:10.933
Your thoughts of
me have changed.

50:12.800 --> 50:14.900
- How do you see this?

50:17.033 --> 50:18.533
- I can see it in front of me.

50:19.733 --> 50:21.800
- [Snorre] How do you see this?

50:24.367 --> 50:27.600
- You look at her with passion,

50:27.600 --> 50:29.067
like you did with thee.

50:30.533 --> 50:32.167
- Turid?

50:32.167 --> 50:33.233
- Yes, Turid.

50:36.033 --> 50:38.033
She is who you admire now.

50:39.833 --> 50:43.000
It is apparent that
your love does not last.

50:46.667 --> 50:50.667
However, she will at one time,

50:50.667 --> 50:53.967
have the same conversation
that I am having with thee.

50:58.333 --> 51:01.100
- I do not like
to be questioned.

51:03.167 --> 51:07.600
I do not like to be
questioned on my thoughts

51:07.600 --> 51:10.500
while we are sitting on my land.

51:10.500 --> 51:12.067
- This was never your land.

51:14.500 --> 51:16.833
Nothing is truly ours.

51:18.133 --> 51:20.533
We take things.

51:20.533 --> 51:23.833
We make things ours but
they are everything but.

51:23.833 --> 51:25.567
(emotional music)

51:25.567 --> 51:26.833
- I took you.

51:29.167 --> 51:30.067
- You did.

51:32.200 --> 51:34.500
- And now you are mine.

51:35.400 --> 51:36.233
- Am I?

51:39.500 --> 51:41.067
- What do you mean by this?

51:43.800 --> 51:45.633
- Women have feelings.

51:47.567 --> 51:51.467
They have wants and
needs just like men.

51:54.500 --> 51:56.333
- You compare me to man?

51:59.633 --> 52:03.333
- Your actions are
everything but of a man's.

52:09.800 --> 52:12.700
(dark tense music)

52:25.967 --> 52:28.633
(somber music)

52:32.067 --> 52:34.833
(leaves rustling)

52:43.233 --> 52:44.167
- Now hide.

52:45.633 --> 52:47.900
(panting)

52:53.767 --> 52:55.567
Hide, we need to hide.

52:59.267 --> 53:00.800
- A Berserker.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.400
- They must have sent for us.

53:02.400 --> 53:04.900
(all panting)

53:13.367 --> 53:14.467
- Go, go, go.

53:37.733 --> 53:39.167
We must go one by one.

53:40.633 --> 53:43.700
We have to separate and meet
at the bottom of the coast.

53:43.700 --> 53:45.233
- [Astrid] We can't.

53:45.233 --> 53:46.767
- We have to, to escape.

53:48.900 --> 53:52.533
He shall see us the
longer we hold tight here.

53:54.067 --> 53:59.067
Take this.

54:00.267 --> 54:02.433
- Take this, it
will protect you.

54:02.433 --> 54:04.500
- What do I do with this?

54:06.800 --> 54:08.067
- You'll be fine.
- I don't know.

54:08.067 --> 54:08.733
Don't leave me.
- You'll be okay.

54:08.733 --> 54:11.400
(Astrid crying)

54:12.867 --> 54:14.067
(Ingrid panting)

54:14.067 --> 54:14.900
- Astrid.

54:17.800 --> 54:18.633
Astrid.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.233
- Sister, go, go.

54:27.367 --> 54:28.200
- Go, go!

54:51.200 --> 54:53.700
(Rolf grunts)

54:56.067 --> 54:57.100
- Wait, wait!

54:58.667 --> 55:00.067
Wait, come back.

55:01.833 --> 55:04.967
(grunts) Enough!

55:04.967 --> 55:07.067
(grunts)

55:10.600 --> 55:12.167
- Get away or I will
cut of your head off

55:12.167 --> 55:13.633
and feed it to the wolves.

55:13.633 --> 55:14.633
- I mean no harm.

55:16.833 --> 55:19.500
(both grunting)

55:27.800 --> 55:31.367
- (panting) You are
the son of Snorre.

55:31.367 --> 55:32.833
(emotional music)

55:32.833 --> 55:34.500
You've come to take me back.

55:36.733 --> 55:38.233
- I have come to protect thee.

55:41.500 --> 55:42.567
Nothing like that.

55:43.867 --> 55:45.567
I have come with
love in my heart.

55:46.900 --> 55:48.300
I was just with your mother.

55:54.200 --> 55:55.067
She's dead.

56:03.667 --> 56:04.500
(Ingrid grunts)

56:04.500 --> 56:07.267
(Rolf shouts)

56:07.267 --> 56:08.100
No!

56:10.933 --> 56:12.800
- And my father?

56:12.800 --> 56:15.700
- (panting) He is alive.

56:18.633 --> 56:21.933
I helped him escape from the
clutches of the Berserker.

56:21.933 --> 56:24.067
He got caught on our escape.

56:25.567 --> 56:26.667
My father wanted,

56:28.133 --> 56:30.500
he wanted me to fight with
your mother in the fields.

56:32.633 --> 56:33.800
- How did she die?

56:33.800 --> 56:36.500
- She was a strong, noble woman.

56:39.967 --> 56:41.100
She was killed by Ivar.

56:42.967 --> 56:44.067
- A brother of yours?

56:46.167 --> 56:48.233
- No, no brother of mine.

56:49.900 --> 56:51.267
- He runs through your blood.

56:53.333 --> 56:55.533
- Yes, but I am
nothing like him.

56:55.533 --> 56:56.967
- And why should I trust you?

56:56.967 --> 56:58.667
- You just have to take my word.

56:58.667 --> 57:00.600
There is nothing else I can say.

57:02.167 --> 57:03.467
You just have to trust me.

57:22.633 --> 57:24.900
(panting)

57:36.100 --> 57:36.933
(tense music)

57:36.933 --> 57:38.267
(Astrid grunts)

57:38.267 --> 57:39.533
- There you are.

57:39.533 --> 57:41.933
(both grunt)

57:46.567 --> 57:51.567
- I don't want to fight you.

57:52.167 --> 57:54.333
(Knut grunts)

58:28.733 --> 58:31.733
- Using a lady's color before
even winning the battle.

58:35.600 --> 58:38.667
- I suppose these will
soon be my quarters.

58:41.767 --> 58:42.733
- Brave of you.

58:46.200 --> 58:48.800
I am a lot stronger
than you may think.

58:50.500 --> 58:55.067
My heart burns with rage,

58:55.067 --> 58:57.700
burns with resentment
and a passion to win.

58:59.100 --> 59:02.933
I have survived hell
and here I stand

59:02.933 --> 59:05.567
and I will not lose
the battle easily.

59:10.133 --> 59:12.400
- You and I are both the same,

59:13.667 --> 59:15.967
both plucked from our families,

59:17.533 --> 59:21.100
except you are older
and I am younger,

59:22.300 --> 59:26.400
and I am newer and I am healthy,

59:28.333 --> 59:29.900
and I am able to have a child.

59:32.800 --> 59:36.767
- You may be these
things, but with age

59:37.633 --> 59:39.367
comes a knowledge of how to win.

59:42.100 --> 59:43.067
Always win.

59:44.200 --> 59:47.900
- (chuckles) You are a
very confident woman.

59:50.067 --> 59:51.533
- No need for confidence.

59:52.933 --> 59:54.733
I was made a Berserker

59:55.633 --> 59:59.400
and I feel no worry, no fear.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.867
I am numb to all emotions.

01:00:05.867 --> 01:00:08.600
I am an animal
inside that will do

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.200
everything it can to survive.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:15.633
And you (tense
music) are in my way.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:18.900
- Am I now?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:23.833
- You are.

01:00:30.033 --> 01:00:32.867
(panting)

01:00:32.867 --> 01:00:36.733
(moving to dramatic music)

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:37.800
- [Knut] Boo.

01:00:49.667 --> 01:00:51.700
(crying)

01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.767
(coughing)

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.333
(panting)

01:01:15.567 --> 01:01:17.400
- Looks like this is the end.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.367
Time to go back,
meet your maker.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.700
- I shall never go back there.

01:01:25.933 --> 01:01:27.800
- You have no other choice.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.067
- I do have other ways.

01:01:30.533 --> 01:01:35.367
- Indeed, you may survive a
battle in the death fields.

01:01:36.233 --> 01:01:39.567
- (panting) That is not my idea.

01:01:49.767 --> 01:01:51.400
- No!

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.867
(dramatic music)

01:01:53.867 --> 01:01:56.500
(somber music)

01:02:00.267 --> 01:02:03.633
- Turid, time has come
for you to battle.

01:02:04.933 --> 01:02:06.933
I no longer trust that woman.

01:02:13.067 --> 01:02:15.800
Vigdis!

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.633
- Welcome.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.167
- Whose blood is
that on your body?

01:02:21.167 --> 01:02:24.667
(dramatic music)

01:02:24.667 --> 01:02:26.400
- Someone whose heart

01:02:30.067 --> 01:02:31.300
was the same as mine.

01:02:33.633 --> 01:02:35.133
Someone who wanted

01:02:38.433 --> 01:02:39.700
the same as me.

01:02:42.067 --> 01:02:44.200
Someone who is not strong.

01:02:55.767 --> 01:02:58.067
Thee gave me a fire inside,

01:03:00.833 --> 01:03:04.700
so deep,

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:05.533
so strong

01:03:08.933 --> 01:03:11.833
and that fire can
never be put out.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.867
- Where is she?

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.133
- I cut out her heart

01:03:25.867 --> 01:03:26.700
and you

01:03:30.167 --> 01:03:31.767
will never have it.

01:03:34.533 --> 01:03:38.533
(Snorre panting and sniffling)

01:03:50.067 --> 01:03:51.400
- What is wrong?

01:03:53.167 --> 01:03:54.267
- Our sister.

01:03:56.767 --> 01:03:59.433
(somber music)

01:04:01.067 --> 01:04:01.967
- Our sister!

01:04:01.967 --> 01:04:04.967
No (cries).

01:04:04.967 --> 01:04:08.767
- I'm sorry I was
unable to protect thee.

01:04:08.767 --> 01:04:10.500
- No, sister, please.

01:04:20.467 --> 01:04:21.400
She's dead.

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.433
- I will take thy life,
(tense music)

01:04:32.433 --> 01:04:34.400
tear apart your world
- No, no!

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.167
- as you have done to ours.

01:04:36.167 --> 01:04:38.667
(Rolf grunts)

01:04:42.967 --> 01:04:43.800
- Stop, stop.
- Let's talk

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.200
this out with reasoning.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.067
- Please stop, please stop.
- How many soldiers

01:04:46.067 --> 01:04:46.967
stand up for you?

01:04:46.967 --> 01:04:49.367
- [Ingrid] Stop, stop please.

01:04:50.533 --> 01:04:53.700
- This is a man
of the Berserker!

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:56.067
- It does not matter.

01:04:56.067 --> 01:04:58.267
Yes, he may be that but
he promises us help.

01:04:59.133 --> 01:05:00.867
- You believe these words?

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:03.300
Ingrid!

01:05:06.067 --> 01:05:07.600
What has happened to your mind?

01:05:09.067 --> 01:05:11.200
What have you been fed for
these words to fall out.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.900
- Leif, we have no choice.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.867
Our family, isn't,
isn't just us now.

01:05:17.867 --> 01:05:20.733
Our father he
remains there, alive.

01:05:20.733 --> 01:05:25.733
Please, the last man
standing it is him and us

01:05:27.533 --> 01:05:29.467
and we are running out of time.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.800
Otherwise our parents they've
given their lives for nothing.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.833
- You trust these words,
you trust this man?

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.367
Sister.
- I do, I do not,

01:05:44.367 --> 01:05:45.833
I do not know what I believe!

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.967
But I know that we
must take action

01:05:50.967 --> 01:05:52.500
before it is the dark of night!

01:05:59.233 --> 01:06:00.900
Please.

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.467
(Leif panting)

01:06:13.533 --> 01:06:16.233
- I will tear you apart,

01:06:16.233 --> 01:06:17.667
if you betray us.

01:06:19.067 --> 01:06:21.233
- And I would do
the same to you,

01:06:21.233 --> 01:06:24.333
but you have nothing
to fear from me.

01:06:31.367 --> 01:06:32.200
(Vigdis screaming)

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.300
- Stay there!

01:06:34.967 --> 01:06:36.767
Take her off, take her.

01:06:36.767 --> 01:06:37.600
Take her!

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.433
- Go, take her off!

01:06:38.433 --> 01:06:39.633
(crowd shouting)

01:06:39.633 --> 01:06:42.467
(Vigdis screams)-

01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:45.400
- Put your hands there!

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.367
- [Vigdis] No!

01:06:46.367 --> 01:06:49.100
(crowd shouting)

01:06:50.533 --> 01:06:52.067
- She took a life.

01:06:54.833 --> 01:06:57.933
- Please no (cries).

01:07:05.367 --> 01:07:06.267
Berserkers!

01:07:07.733 --> 01:07:08.567
(screams)

01:07:08.567 --> 01:07:11.167
(tense music)

01:07:17.567 --> 01:07:19.767
- You want a battle?

01:07:19.767 --> 01:07:21.767
You shall have a battle.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.367
(Vigdis panting)

01:07:26.567 --> 01:07:27.667
Magnus, come.

01:07:28.867 --> 01:07:31.833
(Magnus growling)

01:07:31.833 --> 01:07:33.267
- Magnus?

01:07:33.267 --> 01:07:36.867
Thou gives me no fair
chance against such a beast!

01:07:36.867 --> 01:07:40.167
- You speak of the
beast within you.

01:07:40.167 --> 01:07:42.200
Use that beast.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:43.933
If you win,
(Magnus growls)

01:07:43.933 --> 01:07:45.200
you'll go free.

01:07:49.167 --> 01:07:50.667
- But he's animal.

01:07:53.567 --> 01:07:54.400
(dramatic music)

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.067
- You have a chance.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:00.333
And Gunner.

01:08:04.667 --> 01:08:06.967
- You give me no fair chance.

01:08:06.967 --> 01:08:08.333
- I do now.

01:08:08.333 --> 01:08:10.067
May you have a sword.

01:08:13.067 --> 01:08:15.733
(Vigdis panting)

01:08:16.966 --> 01:08:19.800
(Magnus growling)

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:23.966
(Vigdis gasps)

01:08:28.899 --> 01:08:31.567
(Gunner growls)

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:36.567
(moving to dramatic music)

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.933
(Vigdis screams)

01:09:05.832 --> 01:09:08.500
(Gunner grunts)

01:09:10.167 --> 01:09:11.067
(Gunner growls)

01:09:11.067 --> 01:09:13.700
(Vigdis screams)

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.367
- No one betrays me.

01:09:26.067 --> 01:09:28.700
(somber music)

01:09:48.466 --> 01:09:51.300
- The towns in the east
have all been invaded.

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:54.167
The direction you thought was
right is now completely wrong.

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:00.233
They came to your village

01:10:00.233 --> 01:10:01.833
in the direction
you're heading in.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.367
For safety and to warn people,

01:10:08.567 --> 01:10:09.633
we need to head west.

01:10:10.833 --> 01:10:12.167
They haven't gone
in that direction.

01:10:15.133 --> 01:10:16.267
- Then we will go west.

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.533
We'll warn them so
they are prepared.

01:10:21.333 --> 01:10:24.433
- And how are we to know if
they would ever really be able

01:10:24.433 --> 01:10:25.867
to defend their land, hmm?

01:10:27.933 --> 01:10:29.300
Look what happened to ours.

01:10:31.433 --> 01:10:34.933
- West, that's Turmrig Castle.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.667
There are many people there.

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:40.000
So we go west, we warn them.

01:10:41.467 --> 01:10:44.600
- No, I'm not sure anyone
is enough, not against them.

01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:47.133
They are monsters.

01:10:48.367 --> 01:10:51.500
- The Berserkers, what are they?

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:52.767
(emotional music)

01:10:52.767 --> 01:10:56.167
- Some people, think
that they are inhuman.

01:10:56.167 --> 01:10:59.567
They themselves believe
that they are creatures,

01:10:59.567 --> 01:11:01.133
that their blood is
something different,

01:11:01.133 --> 01:11:03.133
something more powerful
that what we know.

01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:07.567
They are true beasts.

01:11:07.567 --> 01:11:11.500
This fury which they
called Berserker gang,

01:11:14.633 --> 01:11:17.300
it occurs in the heat of battle

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:19.700
and it's provoked by oneself.

01:11:20.733 --> 01:11:22.333
You can see the change,

01:11:23.433 --> 01:11:25.433
the transformation within them.

01:11:25.433 --> 01:11:27.233
(somber music)

01:11:27.233 --> 01:11:30.367
The shivering, the
chattering of the teeth,

01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:34.067
the coldness of their bodies.

01:11:34.067 --> 01:11:36.900
They would howl
as wild as beasts.

01:11:38.333 --> 01:11:41.067
They would take down anyone
and everyone in their sights.

01:11:42.933 --> 01:11:44.933
Those Berserkers lost
all human capacity

01:11:45.833 --> 01:11:47.400
for reason and self-recognition

01:11:50.267 --> 01:11:52.233
and would rip their
enemy to shreds

01:11:54.133 --> 01:11:55.933
with their bare hands.

01:11:57.067 --> 01:11:58.500
No weapon needed.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:03.167
- And how about you?

01:12:05.333 --> 01:12:07.767
Why aren't you a
beast like them, hmm?

01:12:08.933 --> 01:12:11.367
- I don't know how
to answer that.

01:12:11.367 --> 01:12:12.900
I haven't experienced that side

01:12:14.167 --> 01:12:15.400
that I see in them.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.067
I resist every temptation
to become one of them.

01:12:22.567 --> 01:12:24.400
- Have you ever felt
this need before?

01:12:27.233 --> 01:12:28.833
- When I become angry or heated,

01:12:30.067 --> 01:12:33.067
I feel this surge
of energy inside me

01:12:35.067 --> 01:12:36.200
and I can't control it.

01:12:39.733 --> 01:12:42.333
I feel if I were to relax
it would come out of me.

01:12:43.633 --> 01:12:45.833
- And how do we
trust you tonight,

01:12:45.833 --> 01:12:47.800
not to become this thing, hmm?

01:12:50.067 --> 01:12:52.833
- If you want to keep me
calm, there'll be no need.

01:12:56.167 --> 01:12:57.767
I will not give in to the beast.

01:12:59.067 --> 01:13:02.067
- The death fields, has
anyone ever survived?

01:13:03.067 --> 01:13:03.900
- No.

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:07.900
They promise that if you
survive the death fields

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:12.567
and you kill

01:13:12.567 --> 01:13:15.567
the Berserker,
that you will live,

01:13:16.967 --> 01:13:18.400
that you will have your life.

01:13:21.133 --> 01:13:23.867
But no, no one has survived.

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:28.333
The Berserkers
you go up against,

01:13:28.333 --> 01:13:30.933
they are the worst of them all,

01:13:32.467 --> 01:13:35.067
the strongest, the most crazed.

01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:37.933
- My aunt?

01:13:40.133 --> 01:13:44.333
- She fought a strong
battle, a noble woman.

01:13:44.333 --> 01:13:46.233
She put up a good fight.

01:13:46.233 --> 01:13:47.467
- And my father?

01:13:47.467 --> 01:13:49.067
What do they plan
to do with him?

01:13:50.433 --> 01:13:53.633
- My father has a
grudge against yours,

01:13:53.633 --> 01:13:55.233
for what reason I do not know.

01:13:56.567 --> 01:14:00.867
But he plans to
create a fury in him,

01:14:02.567 --> 01:14:03.700
a fury so big

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:07.400
that he turns into a monster.

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:12.233
- Our father is a
peaceful, caring man.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.367
He could never become
what your father is.

01:14:15.367 --> 01:14:16.600
- My father is twisted.

01:14:18.233 --> 01:14:21.433
He plays with people's
minds, including mine.

01:14:22.633 --> 01:14:24.600
Toys with people,
manipulates them.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.233
- Why did you
never leave before?

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.067
Why now?

01:14:30.467 --> 01:14:33.500
- I'm no longer scared of him,
no longer scared of death.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.800
If I die in my
attempt, then I die.

01:14:39.333 --> 01:14:40.733
I used to be scared of death

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.133
and what would happen after it.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.533
But, but but now

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:52.633
if I were to survive
in this world,

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.067
I would want a world
worth surviving for.

01:14:59.133 --> 01:15:02.167
- All right, we need to rest up.

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:11.067
We have to reserve our
energy for morning.

01:15:13.067 --> 01:15:14.367
Are we gonna be safe here?

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:17.900
- A few hours will
be fine to stay here.

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:29.467
(Olav grunting)

01:15:29.467 --> 01:15:30.467
- Olav, sit.

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.700
- Do you wish me to stay?

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.833
- Magnus, you are free to leave.

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:38.567
- Of course.

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.433
- Why am I here?

01:15:42.633 --> 01:15:46.333
- I have a heavy heart
(somber music)

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:47.700
alike to yours,

01:15:50.833 --> 01:15:53.500
a heart that is full of sadness.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.800
A heart that no one understands

01:16:03.833 --> 01:16:05.500
outside these walls.

01:16:09.433 --> 01:16:11.067
I have lost my son,

01:16:15.267 --> 01:16:17.067
I have lost my wives,

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:21.467
I am all alone

01:16:25.433 --> 01:16:26.267
alike you.

01:16:28.733 --> 01:16:29.767
- I'm not alone.

01:16:31.467 --> 01:16:35.100
My children are free,
my wife is free.

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.600
My family have love in
their hearts for me.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.067
And they will
grow, become wiser,

01:16:40.067 --> 01:16:41.533
live the life they should live.

01:16:43.167 --> 01:16:47.067
- Such foolishness you have

01:16:47.067 --> 01:16:49.267
inside you, Olav.

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:52.833
- I have nothing inside
me but the truth.

01:16:53.767 --> 01:16:55.200
- You have hope.

01:16:57.067 --> 01:16:59.100
Hope is not the truth.

01:17:00.333 --> 01:17:01.600
Hope is a wish.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.800
Hope is a need.

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:11.367
Hope is not a fact.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.200
I have never

01:17:16.233 --> 01:17:19.700
had this feeling within me.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.433
It is raw.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.767
It is deep.

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:34.100
I cannot control it,

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:35.400
this emptiness.

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.067
- In just a word,

01:17:41.767 --> 01:17:44.933
a figment of one's imagination
which you would believe

01:17:44.933 --> 01:17:48.267
to give you confidence
and strength.

01:17:48.267 --> 01:17:50.067
It's just a word.

01:17:50.067 --> 01:17:51.700
We are alike ultimately.

01:17:53.233 --> 01:17:54.800
We are one and the same.

01:17:56.233 --> 01:17:57.667
We are human, Snorre.

01:17:59.533 --> 01:18:01.900
- I am not human.

01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:08.100
By tomorrow, these thoughts

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:09.333
will be gone

01:18:11.367 --> 01:18:14.833
as we watch your family

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:20.467
bleed out in front of you,

01:18:20.467 --> 01:18:24.967
as we watch your family

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.367
battle to the death

01:18:30.967 --> 01:18:32.267
on the fields.

01:18:33.233 --> 01:18:34.300
Go rest, Olav.

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:40.267
You will need it
for your battle.

01:18:42.067 --> 01:18:44.733
- War is not necessary

01:18:44.733 --> 01:18:47.067
I will not fight you, never.

01:18:48.567 --> 01:18:49.800
(somber music)

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:52.367
- Then you will make
it an easy battle.

01:18:55.433 --> 01:18:57.600
(panting)

01:19:00.167 --> 01:19:02.833
(gentle music)

01:19:26.233 --> 01:19:27.300
- I cannot rest.

01:19:29.467 --> 01:19:32.200
I am uneasy about
what the future holds,

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.400
what tomorrow holds,

01:19:34.533 --> 01:19:36.167
whether tomorrow
will be my last day.

01:19:36.167 --> 01:19:39.067
(moving to emotional music)

01:19:39.067 --> 01:19:40.067
I am not sleeping.

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.967
My mind it is full
of terrible thoughts.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.300
- I have those same thoughts.

01:19:53.567 --> 01:19:55.467
- I am Ingrid.

01:19:55.467 --> 01:19:56.800
You were not given my name.

01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:58.733
- I am Rolf.

01:20:02.533 --> 01:20:03.767
- My brother, sleeping,

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:05.800
he is Leif.

01:20:11.167 --> 01:20:15.367
- Ingrid, a name of
strength and beauty.

01:20:17.533 --> 01:20:20.400
(both chuckle)

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.900
- I am not so sure about that.

01:20:23.533 --> 01:20:24.733
It was my grandmother's.

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.700
- Was she as beautiful as you?

01:20:29.567 --> 01:20:30.800
- Why are you doing this,

01:20:31.933 --> 01:20:33.200
other than for yourself?

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.867
- Why else would I do it
other than for myself?

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:39.167
- Thank you, Rolf.

01:20:40.633 --> 01:20:45.500
You know, if you were not
here I think we would be dead.

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.633
I believe that to be true.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.133
- You have no need to thank me.

01:20:53.133 --> 01:20:56.767
My family have done some awful,
unspeakable things to you.

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:00.267
- But never you.

01:21:02.433 --> 01:21:04.267
Why do you talk of them?

01:21:04.267 --> 01:21:07.167
Why do you speak of them as if
though you were one of them?

01:21:08.667 --> 01:21:12.100
They may be in your
bones and in your blood

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.333
but your mind, that is you.

01:21:16.067 --> 01:21:17.400
That is not them.

01:22:04.767 --> 01:22:05.600
(ominous music)

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:06.433
- Morning.

01:22:06.433 --> 01:22:09.067
(Ingrid gasps)

01:22:13.667 --> 01:22:14.967
- Come on, Princess.

01:22:14.967 --> 01:22:16.333
- (grunts) Come on.

01:22:16.333 --> 01:22:18.933
(Ingrid moans)

01:22:18.933 --> 01:22:20.367
- [Loki] Come on, sit!

01:22:20.367 --> 01:22:22.067
- [Odin] Get in you.

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:26.867
(Ingrid and Leif grunting)

01:22:26.867 --> 01:22:28.700
- Children, your faces.

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.233
- Father!

01:22:31.233 --> 01:22:32.767
- I thought we would
never meet again.

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.333
- (panting) Rolf!

01:22:38.333 --> 01:22:39.467
- Don't fear.

01:22:39.467 --> 01:22:40.700
- Everything to fear.

01:22:42.233 --> 01:22:44.967
(Rolf grunts)

01:22:44.967 --> 01:22:49.967
- Mother, where is she?
(somber music)

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:52.867
Where is she?

01:22:54.667 --> 01:22:55.600
- She's gone, Leif.

01:22:58.733 --> 01:22:59.533
- No.

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.967
- She's gone (cries).

01:23:11.067 --> 01:23:12.167
- Rolf, for you.

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:16.433
- Leave him with me.

01:23:16.433 --> 01:23:17.833
- You don't wish me to stay,

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.900
just in case?

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.500
- Leave us.

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.667
- [Ragnor] As you wish.

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:27.733
- Father.

01:23:27.733 --> 01:23:31.567
- Do not dare use
that word for me.

01:23:31.567 --> 01:23:35.400
Your tongue should
not know the word

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.633
and your mind should
forget the meaning

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:43.067
for you have no father
on this Earth, boy.

01:23:44.833 --> 01:23:45.667
- Father.

01:23:46.833 --> 01:23:50.867
- I said do not ever
use that word for me!

01:23:51.833 --> 01:23:53.800
You are no son to me.

01:23:56.067 --> 01:23:59.200
I should save my energies today.

01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:04.500
- You are to fight
today, not watch?

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:07.900
- Yes.

01:24:09.233 --> 01:24:10.867
- Who are you to fight?

01:24:10.867 --> 01:24:13.100
- I am to battle you, boy.

01:24:17.667 --> 01:24:22.667
I shall see you on the fields.

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:24.067
Until then...

01:24:26.667 --> 01:24:28.400
(Berserkers shouting)

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.233
- Come on.

01:24:43.367 --> 01:24:48.167
- I will enjoy watching you
get torn apart on that field.

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:49.267
- Who's to go first?

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:54.067
(somber music)

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.900
- I'll put the boy in first.

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:16.733
(Leif grunts)

01:25:16.733 --> 01:25:19.233
(tense music)

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:23.400
(Leif coughs)

01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:30.800
- And who is he against?

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:34.633
- Gunner!

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:43.733
(Gunner laughing)

01:26:08.333 --> 01:26:12.900
- (panting) I will
use your bones

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:14.100
to pick on my teeth.

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:21.200
- Let the battle begin.

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.533
(dramatic music)

01:26:24.533 --> 01:26:27.700
(crowd shouting)

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:30.267
(men grunting)

01:26:35.633 --> 01:26:36.867
- Ah, kill him!

01:26:43.267 --> 01:26:47.700
(Leif grunts)
(swords clanging)

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:50.533
(Gunner grunting)

01:26:55.233 --> 01:26:58.667
(Gunner laughing)

01:26:58.667 --> 01:27:01.367
(Leif grunting)

01:27:06.067 --> 01:27:08.667
(men grunting)

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.867
- So I'll avenge my mother.

01:27:19.433 --> 01:27:22.067
(men grunting)

01:27:31.867 --> 01:27:32.700
- No!

01:27:34.633 --> 01:27:37.300
(Gunner growls)

01:27:42.467 --> 01:27:47.467
(men grunting)
(swords clanging)

01:27:49.767 --> 01:27:51.567
(Leif shouts)

01:27:51.567 --> 01:27:52.400
- Go!

01:27:57.067 --> 01:27:57.900
- Stop!

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:03.333
- No!

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.867
(Leif shouting)

01:28:09.933 --> 01:28:11.600
(Gunner grunts)

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:14.100
(Leif crying)

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.800
(Leif screaming)

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.233
- No!

01:28:20.233 --> 01:28:23.067
(Gunner laughing)

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.333
- No!

01:28:36.767 --> 01:28:39.533
(Gunner grunting)
(Leif screaming)

01:28:39.533 --> 01:28:40.367
- No!

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:46.067
- Don't (cries).

01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:53.700
(tense music)
(Gunner panting)

01:29:08.067 --> 01:29:09.400
- [Snorre] Stop.

01:29:13.667 --> 01:29:16.667
You wish to fight
the mighty Gunner?

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.167
- Get me in there.

01:29:22.167 --> 01:29:23.133
- Ingrid, no!

01:29:23.133 --> 01:29:25.067
- Get me in there!

01:29:25.067 --> 01:29:27.567
- The floor is yours.

01:29:27.567 --> 01:29:30.167
(Rolf panting)

01:29:34.433 --> 01:29:37.100
(somber music)

01:29:40.267 --> 01:29:43.767
- [Leif] Oh God (coughs).

01:29:45.067 --> 01:29:45.867
- Loki.

01:29:46.967 --> 01:29:48.267
- No!

01:29:48.267 --> 01:29:49.833
- It's not fair match!

01:29:49.833 --> 01:29:52.167
She will not stand a chance!

01:29:56.567 --> 01:29:59.233
(ax clattering)

01:30:10.867 --> 01:30:13.700
- [Snorre] Right,
your fancy girl.

01:30:15.233 --> 01:30:17.800
(tense music)

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:29.733
- Have it, it's you
and I to the death.

01:30:47.433 --> 01:30:50.133
(women grunting)

01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:07.800
(Loki shouts)

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:15.067
- Now the ultimate thrill.

01:31:15.067 --> 01:31:17.533
(growls)

01:31:17.533 --> 01:31:20.300

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:40.067
(moving to dramatic music)

01:31:50.467 --> 01:31:51.267
- Gunner!

01:32:23.267 --> 01:32:25.933

(Gunner growling)

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:42.633
(Gunner shouts)
(Ingrid screams)

01:33:42.633 --> 01:33:45.300
(Gunner growls)

01:33:46.467 --> 01:33:49.133
(Gunner laughs)

01:33:56.167 --> 01:33:57.733
- And hands they go (laughs).

01:33:57.733 --> 01:33:58.733

(tense music)

01:34:14.433 --> 01:34:15.533
- Join!
- No!

01:34:18.867 --> 01:34:21.700
(blades clanging)

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:33.167
(Gunner shouts)

01:34:36.367 --> 01:34:37.200
- [Man] Give in!

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:40.067
(Gunner grunting)

01:34:48.133 --> 01:34:51.067
- If the girl is
all you really have,

01:34:51.067 --> 01:34:53.867
I will take her from you.

01:34:53.867 --> 01:34:56.600
See if you find your beast then.

01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:02.467
(Rolf shouting)

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:07.100

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.933
- Come here.

01:35:27.933 --> 01:35:29.467
Stand.

01:35:29.467 --> 01:35:31.533
Come on (grunts).

01:35:31.533 --> 01:35:34.367
(Ingrid grunting)

01:35:39.367 --> 01:35:41.233
- You wish to take my son?

01:35:42.433 --> 01:35:44.367
Not before I take you.

01:35:48.067 --> 01:35:49.400
- [Rolf] Father!

01:35:51.667 --> 01:35:54.167
(tense music)

01:35:58.967 --> 01:36:01.833

01:36:04.667 --> 01:36:07.800

01:36:48.767 --> 01:36:49.833
Let us fight!

01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:53.833
(women grunting)

01:37:14.633 --> 01:37:17.467
(Snorre shouting)

01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:25.600
You're my father, I
should have forgotten you,

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:29.333
your face, your voice,
and every living memory.

01:37:29.333 --> 01:37:30.167
You are

01:37:31.167 --> 01:37:34.967
a murdering savage!

01:37:36.433 --> 01:37:38.400
- That's it, that's my boy.

01:37:42.433 --> 01:37:43.567
- Goodbye, Father.

01:37:43.567 --> 01:37:44.500
- [Man] No!

01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:56.233
(somber music)

01:37:56.233 --> 01:37:57.500
- Stop!

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.167
Everybody stop I command you!

01:38:00.867 --> 01:38:04.900
The war between the Saxons
and Berserkers ends here!

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.233
(Rolf cries)

01:38:29.667 --> 01:38:30.733
- Rolf, Rolf!

01:38:33.267 --> 01:38:34.367
Rolf, it's me.

01:38:34.367 --> 01:38:35.200
It is me.

01:38:38.667 --> 01:38:42.200
(dramatic music)

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.067
It's over,

01:38:45.533 --> 01:38:46.867
the war is over.

01:38:49.067 --> 01:38:49.833
It's over!

01:38:51.433 --> 01:38:52.767
The war is over!

01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:54.633
It's ended!

01:38:58.167 --> 01:39:01.833
(moving to emotional music)

01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:39.333
Rolf.

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.100
- [Rolf] Ingrid.

01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:44.067
- Have your wounds healed?

01:39:44.067 --> 01:39:45.900
- I'm recovering, yours?

01:39:47.067 --> 01:39:47.867
- Much better.

01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:53.200
The townspeople who
fled to the west,

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:54.167
they have returned.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:58.067
They are so grateful
for what you did.

01:39:58.067 --> 01:39:58.833
- We did.

01:40:01.467 --> 01:40:04.233
- You are the main reason
why everything has gone back

01:40:04.233 --> 01:40:05.433
to how it should be.

01:40:07.733 --> 01:40:08.667
You did this.

01:40:12.233 --> 01:40:14.233
- My father said I
was exactly like him.

01:40:16.833 --> 01:40:20.000
When I felt that surge of fury
and anger through my body,

01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:22.233
I understood it.

01:40:27.933 --> 01:40:28.767
- You are nothing
like your father.

01:40:28.767 --> 01:40:31.900
- No but I am, I am.

01:40:33.267 --> 01:40:34.567
I'm exactly like him.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.500
The difference is I
care more about people

01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:41.733
than the Berserker pride.

01:40:43.267 --> 01:40:44.467
He never understood that.

01:40:51.567 --> 01:40:52.900
- Welcome to the new world.

01:40:56.033 --> 01:40:58.600
