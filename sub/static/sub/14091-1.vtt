DOGTOOTH

00:28.362 --> 00:32.448
<i>Today the new words are the following:</i>

00:33.951 --> 00:35.118
<i>Sea...</i>

00:36.453 --> 00:38.372
<i>motorway...</i>

00:39.122 --> 00:41.124
<i>excursion...</i>

00:42.292 --> 00:44.044
<i>and carbine.</i>

00:47.589 --> 00:53.095
<i>A sea is a leather armchair 
with wooden arms</i>

00:53.303 --> 00:55.806
<i>like the one we have
in our living room.</i>

00:56.765 --> 01:01.311
<i>For example:
Don't stand on your feet.</i>

01:01.562 --> 01:05.147
<i>Sit on the sea to have
a quiet chat with me.</i>

01:06.566 --> 01:11.822
<i>A motorway is a very strong wind.</i>

01:14.825 --> 01:20.455
<i>An excursion is a very resistant material...</i>

01:20.664 --> 01:23.500
<i>used to construct floors.</i>

01:24.459 --> 01:25.961
<i>For example:</i>

01:26.503 --> 01:30.132
<i>The chandelier fell violently 
onto the floor...</i>

01:30.340 --> 01:32.968
<i>but no damage was caused to it...</i>

01:33.176 --> 01:36.805
<i>because it is made of 100% excursion.</i>

01:40.475 --> 01:41.768
<i>Carbine.</i>

01:42.644 --> 01:47.316
<i>A carbine is a beautiful white bird.</i>

01:53.697 --> 01:58.368
I say we play a game of endurance.

01:59.870 --> 02:04.041
By that I mean we run hot water
from the taps...

02:04.666 --> 02:07.502
place a finger under the water...

02:07.961 --> 02:11.798
and the one who lasts longest wins.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.469
What do you think?

02:18.138 --> 02:20.015
I like it.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.352
- You?
- I like it as well.

02:24.061 --> 02:27.022
Shall we use all the taps or just one?

02:27.230 --> 02:29.733
We'll just use one if you like.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.860
How will we time it?

02:32.069 --> 02:36.073
With a clock or a stopwatch?

02:36.323 --> 02:39.743
No need.
We'll put our fingers in together.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.205
Last one to take their finger out wins.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.834
So we need all three taps running?

02:49.086 --> 02:52.255
We could do it with just one.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.593
If we use three, someone might sneak
their finger out for a moment.

02:56.843 --> 03:01.264
We could use the bathtub.
It's bigger.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.560
What should we call this game?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.115
I don't know...

03:27.124 --> 03:30.585
Do you like the music
or should I put something else on?

03:31.962 --> 03:33.755
No, it's okay.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.719
No need to be shy.
If you don't like it, let me know.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.805
No, I do like it.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.725
What's your favorite song?

03:49.896 --> 03:51.148
I have two.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.950
Have you taken a bath?

04:03.827 --> 04:04.619
Yes.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.621
Did you wash your hair?

04:09.291 --> 04:12.002
Not my hair.
I washed it yesterday.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.562
- Do you feel dizzy?
- No, I'm fine.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.709
Are you done?

05:36.586 --> 05:38.547
Christina is here.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.698
- Hello, Christina.
- Hello.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.743
You've lost weight.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.246
Yes, a little.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.332
Can I stay, or am I disturbing you?

08:19.749 --> 08:22.919
Stay. You're not disturbing me in the least.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.057
What are those things on your headband?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.934
Sparkling stones.

08:39.561 --> 08:40.937
Sparkling?

08:41.604 --> 08:44.441
They shine in the dark,
like little lights.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.027
Without any power?

08:48.236 --> 08:49.362
Sure.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.532
You're lying.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.367
No, I'm not.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.454
Where did you get it?

08:58.621 --> 09:00.457
I made it myself.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.375
Well done.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.127
Thanks.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.922
Do you have a headband?

09:08.131 --> 09:11.134
A brown one.
But I gave it to my little sister.

09:11.384 --> 09:15.138
She gave me a pair of socks
and two big rubber erasers.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.640
Are those the socks?

09:17.807 --> 09:19.893
No, another pair.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.313
They're nice too.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.606
Thanks.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.321
Will you join us for dinner?

09:32.155 --> 09:34.324
No, unfortunately I have to go.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.619
Too bad. We're having burgers.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.663
Burgers are one of my favorite meals.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.086
What are the others?

09:48.838 --> 09:51.174
I like fish soup and cheese pie.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.843
Fish soup and cheese pie are perfect.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.930
- I had fish soup yesterday.
- Lovely.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.779
There's apple in the juice too.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.364
It's very tasty.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.120
Unfortunately, I have to go.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.832
Shall I shoot a video
with all of us?

10:24.040 --> 10:26.876
Go ahead, we don't have
a video with Christina.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.712
Do you mind if we film us all together?

10:29.879 --> 10:31.172
Not at all.

10:44.561 --> 10:48.231
- Dad, can I sit next to Christina?
- Yes, honey.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.868
Christina, can you smile a bit more?

11:22.432 --> 11:27.770
<i>The sizes of the triangle angles
are 36, 77 and 67 degrees.</i>

11:28.354 --> 11:32.108
<i>Side A has a length of 12.8 cm.</i>

11:32.275 --> 11:36.279
<i>Side C has a length of 9.7 cm.</i>

11:36.529 --> 11:40.283
<i>Find the area of the triangle,
the length of side B...</i>

11:40.450 --> 11:41.951
<i>and the type of triangle.</i>

11:42.201 --> 11:43.536
<i>Good luck.</i>

11:44.913 --> 11:48.791
<i>The eyes of a fresh fish are not:</i>

11:49.209 --> 11:51.044
<i>A) Bleary,</i>

11:51.252 --> 11:52.879
<i>B) Big,</i>

11:53.087 --> 11:55.256
<i>C) Red.</i>

11:55.465 --> 11:56.966
<i>Good luck.</i>

11:58.927 --> 12:05.141
<i>If for any reason
we are still awake at 11:00 p.m.,</i>

12:05.391 --> 12:07.810
<i>what kind of procedure do we follow?</i>

12:09.479 --> 12:10.980
<i>Good luck.</i>

13:06.786 --> 13:08.955
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.708
- Shall I wait for you?
- Yes.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.675
- How do I look?
- Just fine.

13:21.551 --> 13:22.552
Now?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.722
That's fine, too.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.060
I don't think the skirt goes 
with this shirt.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.817
- How many do you have?
- 37.

13:38.026 --> 13:41.487
- You'll be caught if you cheat.
- I've got 37. And you?

13:41.696 --> 13:42.822
52.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.909
You might be the one with the most.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.077
No way.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.591
- More salad?
- No.

14:12.018 --> 14:15.938
We're low on iodine 
and the antihistamines have expired.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.232
Also, we need more bandages.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.860
I'll give you a list.

14:21.069 --> 14:24.697
- Whatever you like.
- And black tint for your eyebrows.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.783
Didn't I get you some last week?

14:26.949 --> 14:31.746
I used it all. I need more.
I can't use blue.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.790
It would be unnatural.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.463
I'll get you some.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.967
- Do you want lemon?
- No, thanks.

14:46.427 --> 14:50.556
We'll be out of meat soon.
You need to bring more.

14:51.474 --> 14:55.812
Mom, could you pass me the phone? Please.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.564
Thank you.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.443
- Did you count your stickers?
- I have 76.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.153
I have 52.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.905
37.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.492
Girls, you have to try harder.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.161
Your brother is the winner again.

15:13.621 --> 15:17.667
That means he selects tonight's entertainment.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.628
But I have a surprise for you.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.421
Something unprecedented.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.843
The next prize will be
not one sticker, or two,

15:27.009 --> 15:28.678
but ten.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.514
So you must do your best.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.350
You see how important it is.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.102
Yes, absolutely.

15:37.103 --> 15:40.189
The winner tells us
how we spend the evening.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.441
I say video.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.943
We haven't watched one in a long time.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.695
It's a good opportunity.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.379
<i>Dad, may I water the plants too?</i>

16:04.714 --> 16:05.882
<i>Run!</i>

16:06.382 --> 16:08.551
<i>Be careful, slow down.</i>

16:11.387 --> 16:13.848
<i>Here, Dad, there's a dry herb.</i>

16:14.724 --> 16:17.393
<i>This is the problem.
There are more in there.</i>

16:17.643 --> 16:18.895
<i>Dad, there's an airplane!</i>

16:20.897 --> 16:24.025
<i>Can you bring a wet cloth
from the kitchen?</i>

16:24.233 --> 16:26.402
<i>Mom, where do we keep them?</i>

16:26.569 --> 16:29.322
<i>Under the sink, in the cupboard.</i>

16:31.157 --> 16:34.869
<i>Careful, don't bring a clean one.</i>

16:35.912 --> 16:38.164
<i>Look out, maybe it'll fall.</i>

16:41.501 --> 16:42.585
<i>Watch out!</i>

16:43.252 --> 16:46.088
<i>Mom, that was great!
Let me take a look.</i>

17:25.461 --> 17:27.546
I wash it much better than you.

17:30.132 --> 17:33.094
I also clean the tires and floor mats.

17:35.471 --> 17:39.308
And I never forget the air freshener. 
Only once.

17:39.725 --> 17:44.897
It smelled nice and I thought
I'd used some...

17:45.314 --> 17:46.607
already...

17:49.652 --> 17:51.487
You rarely remembered it

17:52.280 --> 17:54.657
and often didn't clean the mats

17:54.824 --> 17:58.953
when they had tough stains,
like mud and tar.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.666
I wish you'd see
that I wash it better than you.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.836
You'd have cried if you'd seen that.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.970
He's out at the fence again.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.045
He started throwing rocks at me.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.714
Your brother would never throw stones.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.419
Not yet, I'll tell you when.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.845
Hold on a while.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.939
Now spit it out.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.290
I wish it would fall.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.253
If it falls, I'll get it.

20:13.796 --> 20:17.550
Whoever deserves it will get it.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.950
- Good morning.
- How are you, Christina?

20:43.409 --> 20:45.578
Fine. My leg hurts a little.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.080
When are you coming again?

20:48.289 --> 20:52.293
I'll check the shifts.
Maybe one afternoon next week.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.336
Do you wear the perfume I gave you?

20:55.504 --> 20:57.173
Does it smell good?

20:57.423 --> 20:58.591
It does.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.509
Mr. Petrou called for you.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.802
- Did you water the yucca?
- Two weeks ago.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.722
- Do it every week.
- Yes, sir. Shall I call him?

21:46.889 --> 21:48.891
- No, I'll go.
- Yes, sir.

21:58.234 --> 22:01.987
My belly has been aching
since last night.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.323
Where exactly does it hurt?

22:08.994 --> 22:12.998
On the upper right side.
Could be an inflamed appendix.

22:13.207 --> 22:16.085
The vermiform appendix
is lower down on the right.

22:23.217 --> 22:24.760
- Here?
- No.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.889
- Here?
- No.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.600
- Does it hurt here?
- Yes.

22:33.102 --> 22:36.522
- Avoid eating fruit and vegetables.
- I drank some milk.

22:36.730 --> 22:40.693
It's okay.
You'd better not work out today.

22:41.277 --> 22:44.113
- No medication?
- You don't need any.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.033
Follow my instructions carefully
and you'll get well.

22:48.242 --> 22:52.204
Otherwise your condition will deteriorate.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.375
Get up. Can you play with me?

22:56.584 --> 22:58.627
We have about 20 minutes.

22:59.128 --> 23:02.548
I have a new anesthetic.
Do you want to try it out?

23:02.881 --> 23:03.883
Yes.

23:04.550 --> 23:07.595
The one who wakes up first
will be the winner.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.269
Don't put more on mine.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.321
One, two, three.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.989
It's nearly finished.
It needs floor tiles and lights.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.825
I can't decide which one I prefer.

24:17.957 --> 24:21.669
- I like these.
- I prefer those.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.921
Those are nice too.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.715
- How's your wife?
- Same.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.968
- Do you go out?
- No.

24:30.636 --> 24:33.889
I told you, you should.
Even if she's in a wheelchair.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.809
She's unwell.
And she doesn't like visitors.

24:37.017 --> 24:40.729
I've told her hundreds of times
to invite you for a beer.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.189
I understand.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.733
It's tragic what happened to her.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.361
It requires great psychological strength.

24:47.569 --> 24:50.572
In the picture, she looks energetic.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.491
She was a volleyball champion?

24:52.700 --> 24:53.742
Handball.

24:57.413 --> 24:58.706
These you said?

24:58.914 --> 25:01.000
Yes. The others are nice too.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.287
Hi, honey.

25:39.621 --> 25:42.541
I had a meeting. A meeting, yes.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.628
Did they go out? Or work out?

25:46.879 --> 25:50.632
Why, what's the matter?
Her belly or her stomach?

25:51.425 --> 25:52.634
Yes, it's cold outside.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.928
I'd like my dog back.

26:41.141 --> 26:44.269
Sorry, I can't do that.

26:44.478 --> 26:48.524
He's still on the second stage
of his training.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.444
I'll show you.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.956
First stage, second stage-

27:04.164 --> 27:05.707
where your dog is-

27:05.874 --> 27:08.710
third, fourth, fifth and final stage.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.012
Let me explain.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.515
Dogs are like clay

27:21.974 --> 27:26.145
and our job here is to mold them.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.356
A dog may be energetic,

27:30.399 --> 27:34.319
a fighter, cowardly, or gentle.

27:36.238 --> 27:41.076
All this requires work, patience
and care from us.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.913
Every dog is waiting for us

27:45.163 --> 27:47.541
to show it how it should behave.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.586
Do you understand?

27:50.919 --> 27:53.505
So the issue here

27:53.714 --> 27:58.760
is to decide together
how we want your dog to behave.

27:59.720 --> 28:04.391
Do we want an animal
or do we want a friend?

28:07.269 --> 28:11.106
Do we want a guard
who will respect us as his masters

28:11.940 --> 28:15.402
and do unhesitatingly 
whatever we ask of him?

28:16.403 --> 28:17.946
You see?

28:18.363 --> 28:19.448
Sure.

28:29.791 --> 28:30.792
Rex!

28:33.462 --> 28:34.546
Rex!

30:41.923 --> 30:43.425
1 minute 15 seconds.

30:56.897 --> 30:58.023
2 minutes.

31:05.072 --> 31:06.531
2 minutes 30 seconds.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.620
2 minutes 45 seconds.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.089
3 minutes 15 seconds.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.391
3 minutes 45 seconds.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.161
4 minutes 30 seconds.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.755
5 minutes 15 seconds.

32:09.511 --> 32:11.346
Five minutes 30 seconds.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.570
What do you mean you can't?

33:52.280 --> 33:53.782
I'm sorry.

33:54.699 --> 33:58.119
We're doing this for you,
not for me.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.704
I'm sorry.

34:00.789 --> 34:04.793
Try again but use your tongue.
There's no point otherwise.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.471
Don't tell Dad.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.224
- Do you feel disgusted?
- No.

34:19.599 --> 34:20.976
Then what?

34:22.978 --> 34:25.438
I prefer what we did last time.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.289
Hello.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.626
What are you doing?

34:47.168 --> 34:50.672
Cleaning the carpet to keep germs off it.

35:03.018 --> 35:06.521
- Do you want this headband?
- Yes, very much.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.024
What are you going to give me?

35:14.863 --> 35:17.699
How about this pencil?
It has an eraser on it.

35:17.949 --> 35:18.950
No.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.125
A tape measure?

35:28.376 --> 35:31.212
You press here and it reels in by itself.

35:32.005 --> 35:33.048
No.

35:44.225 --> 35:48.146
Come closer and lick for a while
and the headband is yours.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.191
Are you disgusted?

35:51.566 --> 35:52.650
No.

36:18.551 --> 36:21.262
- Do you want to dance?
- I don't feel like it.

36:21.513 --> 36:26.434
Besides, we don't have time.
We have to go meet Mom.

36:26.601 --> 36:30.772
Mom will be late. 
She's talking to herself again in her room.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.566
Are you afraid of Mom talking to herself?

36:33.775 --> 36:34.901
Not at all.

36:35.110 --> 36:36.528
- You are afraid.
- I'm not.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.446
- You are.
- No.

36:39.114 --> 36:42.367
You can't hear her.
She might be talking about you.

36:42.575 --> 36:43.952
Stop it.

36:50.875 --> 36:53.420
If I give you a present,
will you lick me?

36:53.628 --> 36:55.964
- What kind of present?
- A headband.

36:56.131 --> 36:57.590
I already have one.

36:57.799 --> 37:00.260
This one sparkles in the dark.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.303
What do you mean by sparkles?

37:03.096 --> 37:04.264
It lights up.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.599
Where did you get it?

37:06.808 --> 37:08.309
I can't tell you.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.730
Do our parents know
you have a headband like that?

37:13.565 --> 37:16.609
So, it could easily be yours.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.572
What do you want me to lick?

37:22.282 --> 37:23.491
My shoulder.

37:38.673 --> 37:42.135
Can you get some chocolate
if you pass by the shop?

37:42.343 --> 37:45.180
Don't go out of your way.

37:48.349 --> 37:49.684
Any kind.

37:58.151 --> 37:59.194
Me too.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.220
That isn't yours.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.014
Leave me alone.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.214
- Does it still hurt?
- Yes.

40:28.217 --> 40:32.388
You could ask Dad to get in the car
and fetch it for you.

40:32.597 --> 40:35.224
That's what I'd do if I were you.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.018
It's the only way.

40:41.689 --> 40:42.690
Dad!

40:46.861 --> 40:49.948
The eldest threw the airplane
over the fence.

40:50.198 --> 40:52.617
- Where?
- There, on the road.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.119
I'll try.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.351
How did it happen?

43:24.936 --> 43:26.437
What did you tell them?

43:28.022 --> 43:30.066
You did the right thing.

43:30.691 --> 43:32.401
I'll tell them as well.

43:33.361 --> 43:36.239
Yes, it's a good opportunity.

43:36.697 --> 43:37.740
<i>Yes.</i>

43:39.492 --> 43:43.037
<i>The temperature will rise
and the wind will drop.</i>

43:45.665 --> 43:47.834
<i>Five or six degrees.</i>

43:49.210 --> 43:50.545
<i>All right.</i>

43:52.505 --> 43:57.260
<i>No, it's time to put an end to this.
It's exhausting for everyone.</i>

43:59.679 --> 44:03.182
<i>I agree. You're absolutely right.</i>

44:04.058 --> 44:05.017
<i>Yes.</i>

44:29.917 --> 44:31.794
Your brother is dead.

44:33.588 --> 44:36.883
A creature like the one in the garden 
tore him apart.

44:38.092 --> 44:39.302
On the one hand,

44:39.552 --> 44:43.931
he made a huge mistake,
venturing out ill-prepared.

44:45.933 --> 44:50.104
On the other hand, he was my son 
and I feel sorry for him.

44:51.647 --> 44:54.108
The animal that threatens us is a "cat":

44:54.317 --> 44:56.277
the most dangerous animal there is.

44:56.944 --> 45:00.781
It eats meat,
children's flesh in particular.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.951
After lacerating its victim
with its claws,

45:04.118 --> 45:05.995
it devours them with sharp teeth.

45:06.245 --> 45:08.331
The face and whole body of the victim.

45:09.123 --> 45:12.793
If you stay inside, you are protected.

45:13.753 --> 45:16.088
We have to be ready

45:16.297 --> 45:20.301
in case it invades the house or the garden.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.730
Our dear brother...

46:16.899 --> 46:21.362
we are all very sorry that you failed 
to exterminate the cat...

46:22.196 --> 46:23.823
<i>like I did.</i>

46:25.074 --> 46:26.993
<i>We are going to miss you...</i>

46:28.536 --> 46:30.830
<i>even though you made many mistakes.</i>

46:38.713 --> 46:40.381
<i>It's a real pity</i>

46:41.215 --> 46:43.718
<i>that it happened to you</i>

46:43.884 --> 46:48.889
<i>and that I couldn't use my knowledge 
to save you.</i>

46:56.397 --> 47:00.735
<i>My brother, I never expected...</i>

47:01.861 --> 47:05.406
<i>that things would turn out this way.</i>

47:06.949 --> 47:12.455
<i>I hoped you'd manage to survive
with the supplies I procured.</i>

47:13.873 --> 47:16.250
<i>But the dangers are many.</i>

47:17.376 --> 47:19.128
<i>I am very sad.</i>

47:22.757 --> 47:26.052
Push three times on the chest.
Forcefully.

47:26.594 --> 47:27.636
One,

47:28.095 --> 47:29.138
two,

47:29.430 --> 47:30.431
three.

47:31.265 --> 47:33.476
Afterwards you close her nose,

47:33.726 --> 47:36.604
open her mouth and blow.

48:47.675 --> 48:49.218
I'm pregnant.

48:50.136 --> 48:54.181
One boy, one girl. Twins.

48:54.515 --> 48:56.016
Two boys?

48:57.309 --> 48:59.061
No, a boy and a girl.

48:59.311 --> 49:00.896
Are you sure?

49:01.147 --> 49:02.189
Yes.

49:02.356 --> 49:03.732
Triplets?

49:05.693 --> 49:07.570
That's a bit much.

49:09.363 --> 49:11.365
You're right, twins.

49:14.910 --> 49:16.871
Turn round, do the same thing.

49:30.217 --> 49:32.261
Turn round, do the same thing.

49:42.188 --> 49:43.606
Okay.

49:48.569 --> 49:49.737
Dive in.

49:57.077 --> 49:58.120
Ready.

49:59.038 --> 50:01.874
One, two, three, go.

50:18.224 --> 50:19.141
<i>In a few months,</i>

50:19.391 --> 50:22.603
<i>your mother will give birth
to two children and a dog.</i>

50:25.397 --> 50:28.067
<i>Some of you might not like this</i>

50:28.275 --> 50:31.237
<i>because they'll be sharing their room,</i>

50:31.445 --> 50:33.739
<i>their clothes, or even their toys.</i>

50:34.448 --> 50:35.449
<i>However,</i>

50:35.616 --> 50:37.451
<i>look on the bright side:</i>

50:37.660 --> 50:39.828
<i>you'll have two more people
to support you,</i>

50:40.079 --> 50:41.622
<i>the family will be bigger.</i>

50:41.830 --> 50:45.501
<i>Let's all applaud your mother
in anticipation of this gift.</i>

50:56.303 --> 50:58.264
I don't want to share my room.

50:58.472 --> 51:01.642
If you behave, 
you won't have to share with anyone.

51:01.850 --> 51:03.102
I will.

51:03.477 --> 51:06.146
I don't want to share my room either.

51:07.314 --> 51:11.360
<i>If I see improvements 
in your behavior and performance...</i>

51:11.610 --> 51:13.988
<i>I might avoid giving birth.</i>

51:14.780 --> 51:18.450
<i>But if things remain the same,
you give me no choice.</i>

51:19.285 --> 51:22.204
<i>As for the dog,
I don't want to hear a thing.</i>

51:22.454 --> 51:25.499
<i>I'll give birth as soon as possible.</i>

51:34.508 --> 51:37.386
Well done, honey.
I mean well done, everyone.

51:37.636 --> 51:40.014
Dry yourself. Come and pick a prize.

51:41.640 --> 51:45.519
Don't touch it with wet hands
or it won't stick afterwards.

51:47.021 --> 51:48.355
One more thing.

51:48.689 --> 51:51.567
Your performance was worse
than last time.

51:51.817 --> 51:53.193
I need say no more.

51:55.988 --> 51:57.990
Oh, there's an airplane.

52:01.827 --> 52:03.495
It fell in the garden.

52:44.286 --> 52:46.580
No, not that much. It hurts.

52:48.916 --> 52:50.125
This much?

52:50.417 --> 52:51.460
Less.

52:55.923 --> 52:57.466
This much?

52:59.385 --> 53:00.594
That's it.

53:08.310 --> 53:12.815
Do you want me to lick you,
then you'll give me a present?

53:13.065 --> 53:14.775
I have nothing to give you.

53:16.652 --> 53:18.112
It doesn't matter.

53:32.793 --> 53:34.586
This is a good spot.

54:02.948 --> 54:03.824
Good morning, Dad.

54:03.991 --> 54:05.993
How many hours did you sleep?

54:06.160 --> 54:07.494
About nine.

54:25.471 --> 54:28.807
<i>I lost you and my spring departed</i>

54:29.725 --> 54:33.187
<i>Filled with sorrow the stars 
and the birds cry</i>

54:33.854 --> 54:38.525
<i>Gray is the dusk and gray my soul</i>

54:39.193 --> 54:43.155
<i>And all is sorrowful
because you are lost</i>

54:44.656 --> 54:52.331
<i>Where are you now, my love</i>

54:52.831 --> 54:54.124
Mind the little toe!

54:54.208 --> 54:58.462
<i>Where are you roaming</i>

54:58.545 --> 55:01.882
<i>For all of this time</i>

55:03.008 --> 55:10.891
<i>Where are you now, my love</i>

55:11.809 --> 55:15.771
<i>I search and search for you</i>

55:16.438 --> 55:19.942
<i>Yet I do not find you</i>

56:00.941 --> 56:02.776
Dad!

56:05.070 --> 56:06.905
There are two fish in the pool.

56:07.072 --> 56:07.823
What kind?

56:07.990 --> 56:11.577
Sea bream, I think.
But I'm not sure.

56:11.785 --> 56:13.328
You must come and catch them.

56:13.579 --> 56:16.582
Mom will be happy if I'm right.

56:16.790 --> 56:19.459
Give me a minute and I'll come.

56:41.148 --> 56:42.816
There are three.

56:43.525 --> 56:47.362
They were two a minute ago.
Probably the other one came later.

57:12.721 --> 57:15.223
The most creative years of a man?

57:15.474 --> 57:17.309
Between 30 and 40.

57:17.517 --> 57:19.811
And of a woman?

57:20.020 --> 57:21.480
Between 20 and 30.

57:22.397 --> 57:25.067
A child is ready to leave the house...

57:25.233 --> 57:27.069
When the right dogtooth comes out.

57:27.319 --> 57:29.488
Or the left. No matter.

57:29.696 --> 57:31.823
Only then is your body ready

57:32.032 --> 57:33.700
to face the dangers that lurk.

57:34.868 --> 57:37.704
To leave the house and be safe outside,

57:37.913 --> 57:39.706
we must take the car.

57:40.415 --> 57:42.542
When are we ready to learn to drive?

57:42.876 --> 57:45.379
When the right dogtooth grows again.

57:45.545 --> 57:47.714
Or the left, it doesn't matter.

57:50.509 --> 57:52.177
Mom, what's a pussy?

57:53.261 --> 57:55.347
Where did you hear that word?

57:55.722 --> 57:58.558
I saw it on a video case,
on top of the VCR.

58:01.269 --> 58:03.855
A pussy is a big light.

58:04.106 --> 58:05.774
For example:

58:06.566 --> 58:11.571
The pussy is switched off,
the room plunges into darkness.

58:18.870 --> 58:21.206
Do you want to hear
your grandfather sing?

58:21.415 --> 58:22.207
Yes!

58:59.953 --> 59:01.788
Dad loves us.

59:03.623 --> 59:05.542
Mom loves us.

59:07.753 --> 59:09.629
Do we love them?

59:09.880 --> 59:11.423
Yes, we do.

59:11.965 --> 59:14.217
I love my brothers and sisters...

59:14.968 --> 59:17.596
because they love me as well.

59:18.388 --> 59:21.725
The spring is flooding my house...

59:23.101 --> 59:25.479
the spring is flooding...

59:27.147 --> 59:28.899
my little heart.

59:31.109 --> 59:35.155
My parents are proud of me...

59:36.239 --> 59:38.492
because I'm doing just fine.

59:40.076 --> 59:45.499
I'm doing just fine,
but I will always try harder.

59:47.667 --> 59:51.671
My house, you are beautiful
and I love you...

59:53.757 --> 59:55.300
and I will never...

59:59.346 --> 01:00:00.347
ever leave you.

01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:48.353
I saw you in my dreams the other day.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:52.148
I was in the woods with your dad.

01:00:52.357 --> 01:00:56.570
In the evening we had a fire
and roasted potatoes for dinner.

01:00:56.736 --> 01:01:00.031
Suddenly we heard a weird sound
behind a bush.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.909
It was you... and you were a zombie.

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:07.163
Your father threw rocks at you.
So did I.

01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:10.208
- But we couldn't hit you.
- What was I?

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:12.085
A zombie.

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:15.422
- Do you know what a zombie is?
- I do.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.758
- Do you have dreams?
- I do.

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:22.387
Tell me about one you had lately.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.933
Mom fell into the pool.

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:28.602
And then?

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:30.687
Nothing. Just that.

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:40.697
I brought you another present.
Hair gel.

01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:43.950
You put it on your hair,
to shape it.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.460
I don't like it.

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:55.462
What do you mean?

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:58.924
I don't like this present.
Anyway I don't believe you.

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:02.594
You told me your headband sparkled
and it wasn't true.

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:05.138
It was! No way doesn't it sparkle.

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.223
Maybe you did something wrong.

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:08.808
I don't believe you.

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:10.143
Look.

01:02:14.773 --> 01:02:15.941
Look at me.

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:20.320
Look.

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:31.498
If you want me to lick you,
I need a better present.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.250
I don't have anything else.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:42.676
I want these.

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:45.261
I can't give you those.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:48.306
- I want them.
- It isn't possible.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.183
In that case, get out.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.352
I can't give them to you.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:55.313
Get out.
I'm not going to lick you again.

01:02:56.481 --> 01:03:00.026
And I'll tell my parents
you brought me a sparkling headband.

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.195
And that you told me to lick

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:05.323
your keyboard down there.

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:09.995
Do you know what Dad will do
if he finds out I lick your keyboard?

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:30.724
Please, you have to give them
back to me next week.

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:48.533
Mom, what's a zombie?

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.249
Where did you hear that word?

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:58.335
I don't remember. Probably Dad.

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:08.678
A zombie is a small yellow flower.

01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:32.303
What are you doing here?

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:35.682
I couldn't sleep, Dad.
I felt very tense.

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:38.685
I'm afraid.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:43.022
As long as you don't go 
into the garden alone, you're safe.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.317
Would I let you come to any harm?

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:52.824
Dad, I want to learn to fight.

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:55.535
What was that? I can't hear you.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.872
When will I learn how to fight?

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:02.459
Can you turn your robot off?

01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:06.212
I fight so you don't have to.

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:10.008
I want you to use your head
for something else...

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:15.013
other than a punching bag, like me.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:20.018
Your head doesn't look 
like a punching bag.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:21.728
No.

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.522
This is good, thanks.

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:28.735
It looks like a baseball glove.

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:31.237
You're a smart-ass, aren't you?

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:35.909
Mr. Balboa, Mr. Creed on the phone.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.068
There are all types of shark.

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:12.570
Hammer shark...

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:15.865
blue, mako and white shark.

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:21.621
The chances of the imbeciles
getting the right one...

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:26.626
These types of shark aren't found here.

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:29.254
It's very unlikely.

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:38.721
I don't mean that it isn't 
the shark we're looking for.

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:41.641
It probably is, Martin.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.060
It's a man-eater!

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:04.289
It's a man-eater!

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:23.683
Its jaws are different
from the bites on the victim.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:27.103
I want to be sure
and you want to be sure.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:30.189
We want to be sure, don't we?

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.122
Anybody else seen them?

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:48.291
No.

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:53.004
Get me the duct tape.

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:57.443
I want you to call me Bruce.

01:09:57.944 --> 01:09:59.445
What's Bruce?

01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:01.280
It's a name.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.575
Every time you say Bruce, I'll turn.

01:10:05.118 --> 01:10:07.245
I want a name like that too.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:12.125
Take your pick.
You can have any name you like.

01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:16.087
I want you to call me "back".

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:18.756
You can't be called that.

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:20.717
We call our back, back.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.808
Bruce!

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:32.270
Bruce!

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:43.781
Bruce!

01:10:46.993 --> 01:10:48.161
Bruce!

01:10:55.585 --> 01:11:00.506
It's nice. My wife and I 
thought your house would be like this.

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:01.924
Thanks.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:05.094
Where's the perfume I got you?

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:06.637
In the bathroom.

01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:09.348
It's very good perfume.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:13.519
My wife absolutely insisted
on getting you that one.

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:15.521
We thought of getting you a vase

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:20.067
but we thought it wouldn't match the house, 
so we chose perfume.

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:24.697
Do you live here alone?

01:11:24.906 --> 01:11:28.034
Yes. My parents are on the fourth floor.

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:08.908
I hope your kids have bad influences
and develop a bad personality.

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:10.952
I wish this with all my heart.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.497
As punishment for the evil
you have caused my family.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.320
She hit my leg with a hammer.

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.281
He's lying! It wasn't me.

01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:52.785
I came in and saw a cat with a hammer
jumping out the window.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.121
She did it.

01:12:55.329 --> 01:12:57.290
You're hallucinating from the pain.

01:12:57.498 --> 01:13:00.167
You'll need analgesics and a plaster.

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:02.461
I bet it's broken, Dad.

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:14.181
Did you do what we said?

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.183
Did you take precautions?

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:18.394
He didn't have time, Dad.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:21.188
From what I saw, it was very quick.

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:23.065
Really quick.

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:31.991
You devote less time to the kids.

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:35.661
Don't cry.
The kids might see you crying.

01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:38.748
Haven't you combed today?

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.043
I have.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:49.175
I had a tough day.

01:13:56.349 --> 01:13:59.852
We have to find someone
to replace Christina.

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:08.027
You can't trust anyone anymore.

01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:12.198
Nobody else will enter this house.

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:17.870
I'm considering assigning the task
to the elder one.

01:14:18.037 --> 01:14:20.873
Then again he could make 
his own mind up.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.292
That's probably better.

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:13.040
Do that again, bitch,
and I'll rip your guts out.

01:19:16.043 --> 01:19:18.337
I swear on my daughter's life

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:22.174
that you and your clan

01:19:22.383 --> 01:19:25.344
won't last long in this neighborhood.

01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:35.521
Mom!

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:40.025
I found two little zombies!

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:44.363
Shall I bring them to you?

01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:49.952
Mom!

01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:55.249
Mom!

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:18.290
It's our wedding anniversary.

01:21:18.499 --> 01:21:21.835
We'll celebrate by eating cakes

01:21:22.044 --> 01:21:25.547
and decorating the house
with balloons and lights.

01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:31.512
Sit up a bit.

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:41.480
I think my dogtooth is moving.

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:50.989
You're imagining things.
It isn't moving at all.

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:02.418
- Did you sleep well last night?
- Great.

01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:16.325
Dad I'm tired. Can I stop?

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:19.119
Sure, honey, if you can't go on.

01:24:49.835 --> 01:24:51.169
Enough.

01:28:42.901 --> 01:28:45.487
Dad, will you give me the harpoon gun?

01:28:47.072 --> 01:28:49.783
I've told you,
the harpoon gun is dangerous.

01:28:50.242 --> 01:28:52.118
I can lick your ear if you want.

01:30:36.222 --> 01:30:37.265
Bruce!

01:30:40.936 --> 01:30:42.270
Bruce!

01:31:28.733 --> 01:31:30.568
I'll go get the dog tomorrow.

01:31:31.653 --> 01:31:34.572
The fifth level will be finished
by now for sure.

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:46.751
Either drink the orange juice while it's fresh 
or don't drink it at all.

01:36:19.941 --> 01:36:22.694
