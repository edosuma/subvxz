The <i>We Like to Move It Crew</i>
presents:

00:06.963 --> 00:09.508
seriessub.com

00:13.604 --> 00:15.806
Feed the penguins. Two bucks.

00:18.051 --> 00:18.851
Animals.

00:19.993 --> 00:22.102
- Now, Skipper?
- Not yet, Private.

00:22.227 --> 00:23.814
You got to play hard to get,

00:24.146 --> 00:25.399
Make'em beg for it.

00:25.710 --> 00:28.819
- Over Here!
- Hey penguins. That's the time.

00:29.156 --> 00:32.198
I'm beginning to sense
restless hostility from the crowd.

00:32.448 --> 00:33.895
We're going to lose them.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.868
Commence adorable high jinks.

00:36.037 --> 00:36.953
Go. Go. Go.

00:37.424 --> 00:41.306
Executing waddle with odd but somehow
strangely endearing body shakes.

00:43.491 --> 00:46.928
Pretending to lose my balance
and face-plant into the pool now.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.965
I call belly slide duty.

00:50.090 --> 00:52.885
Let's make it extra cute
and cuddly today, boys.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:11.480 --> 01:12.480
Perfect.

01:12.605 --> 01:14.949
Look how beautitious you are.

01:15.508 --> 01:18.103
And this apple here
is looking pretty good too.

01:24.114 --> 01:26.496
Not feeding the penguins time.

01:26.621 --> 01:29.446
How am I supposed
to enjoy my breakfast

01:29.571 --> 01:32.851
with all of the savage,
fishy-smelling fishes assaulting

01:32.976 --> 01:34.218
my kingly senses?

01:36.119 --> 01:37.596
The royal nose clamp.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.880
There. That should do the trick.

01:45.798 --> 01:47.315
Irresistibility reading.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.527
The crowd's appetite for our enamoring
antics is reaching optimal levels.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.696
Beautiful.
Hit them with the tail wags.

01:53.864 --> 01:54.822
No mercy.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.869
And cease tail wagging.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.788
Always leave them wanting more.

02:05.937 --> 02:06.959
We did it.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.711
Fish are incoming.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.080
Three, two...

02:10.205 --> 02:12.694
Wake up your taste buds, boys.

02:13.897 --> 02:14.925
What are these?

02:15.094 --> 02:17.053
How's the catch of the day,
gentlemen?

02:18.771 --> 02:19.871
Looks fishy.

02:20.474 --> 02:24.022
- Fish are supposed to look fishy.
- No, I think he means "fishy."

02:24.436 --> 02:26.020
Good fishy or bad fishy?

02:27.439 --> 02:29.190
Definitely bad fishy, sir.

02:31.768 --> 02:34.612
That's strange.
There's no fish stank. Nothing.

02:36.750 --> 02:37.869
You are right.

02:37.994 --> 02:41.243
The fishy-smelling fish fumes
are no more.

02:41.648 --> 02:43.705
We shall wildly celebrate,

02:43.830 --> 02:46.665
and I am talking about more than usual,
you know what I mean?

02:46.897 --> 02:48.956
But if it's not fish, what is it?

02:50.165 --> 02:53.589
It appears to be some kind
of molecular soy composite.

02:54.088 --> 02:56.217
We're supposed to eat this chow?

03:00.430 --> 03:03.299
We're penguins, man.
We need fish, real fish.

03:03.642 --> 03:06.644
Technically, these cakes do meet
our nutritional requirements.

03:10.470 --> 03:12.274
Boys, let's give it a shot.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.850
Maybe it's more
of an acquired taste.

03:27.281 --> 03:28.081
Right.

03:28.491 --> 03:29.676
We do again.

03:32.061 --> 03:33.061
Again

03:34.548 --> 03:35.548
Again.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.133
Again.

03:37.732 --> 03:38.968
Abort. Abort.

03:42.850 --> 03:45.433
This has got to be
some sort of freak experiment,

03:45.602 --> 03:47.206
a one-time thing, right?

03:50.734 --> 03:51.962
We're charming.

03:52.087 --> 03:53.635
We're lovable.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.191
We're hungry for real fish.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.952
Three days,
and I am loving this life, baby.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.205
No fishy fish fumes fuming
from the fish eaters.

04:16.709 --> 04:19.521
You see, Mort, I am so happy,

04:19.646 --> 04:22.976
I forgot for a second
how disgusting you are.

04:23.101 --> 04:24.201
Look at you.

04:26.745 --> 04:27.745
Fish.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.543
67 hours without the succulent,

04:36.668 --> 04:38.536
salty tang of the sea.

04:41.836 --> 04:43.532
He can't take much more.

04:44.167 --> 04:46.067
Neither can I.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.664
What I'm about to show you
is highly classified.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Slide.

04:55.370 --> 04:56.170
Sorry.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.798
I don't know how
the holiday snaps got in there.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.778
This is our target.

05:08.903 --> 05:10.115
One standard...

05:13.235 --> 05:15.563
One standard restaurant-grade
fish truck.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.609
Where are we on cracking this code?

05:19.726 --> 05:21.946
It's fiendishly clever inscription.

05:22.569 --> 05:26.370
I've secured the services
of a specialist for aerial surveillance.

05:27.597 --> 05:30.871
- I get a cut of the haul, right?
- You'll get your fair share, pinky.

05:34.021 --> 05:35.167
No, never.

05:35.722 --> 05:39.255
We cannot allow them to return
the ferocious fishing fishy smell

05:39.380 --> 05:40.522
to my kingdom.

05:41.353 --> 05:42.353
Gather around.

05:42.478 --> 05:45.213
Now, we need to be doing
exactly what I say,

05:45.338 --> 05:48.179
starting
with paying strict attention

05:48.304 --> 05:50.349
to me talking right now.

05:51.450 --> 05:52.450
Right now.

05:53.552 --> 05:54.552
Now.

05:57.944 --> 05:59.275
This is Wiener One.

05:59.444 --> 06:01.110
I am up and operational.

06:01.278 --> 06:04.280
<i>Target is on the move.
Repeat, target is on the move.</i>

06:04.448 --> 06:05.571
Roger, Wiener One.

06:05.696 --> 06:08.130
We are southbound,
approaching rendez-vous.

06:12.751 --> 06:14.665
Target turning east
onto 23rd Street.

06:14.834 --> 06:16.417
Eye in the sky is a go.

06:22.283 --> 06:24.007
34 seconds until fish.

06:30.841 --> 06:33.350
Prairie Dog Blue and Prairie Dog Red
are in position.

06:34.211 --> 06:36.812
Roger, t-minus five, four,

06:37.204 --> 06:38.397
<i>three, two,</i>

06:38.565 --> 06:39.565
one.

06:40.008 --> 06:41.901
Stopping target.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.656
<i>You are go for insertion.</i>

06:48.005 --> 06:49.683
Go fish.

07:00.731 --> 07:03.496
<i>I want confirmation
that there is food on that vehicle.</i>

07:04.761 --> 07:07.836
That's affirmative,
but it looks like the food is us.

07:12.391 --> 07:13.141
Help!

07:13.348 --> 07:14.808
Hang on, Prairie Dogs.

07:15.340 --> 07:17.228
Keep your eyes on the target.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.106
I am locked on, Skipper.

07:31.403 --> 07:33.452
<i>This is Wiener One.
Are we aborting mission?</i>

07:33.621 --> 07:35.162
<i>Repeat, are we aborting mission?</i>

07:36.999 --> 07:39.291
Gentlemen, we are penguins.

07:39.832 --> 07:42.545
<i>We have a natural need to feed
on the fruits of the sea.</i>

07:42.714 --> 07:44.527
That's the way
momma nature built us.

07:44.652 --> 07:47.842
Now, who wants to spit in the eye
of momma nature?

07:50.173 --> 07:51.637
That's what I thought.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.764
We are go for operation.

07:54.189 --> 07:58.042
Target is turning right onto Broadway.
I am sending it to extraction point.

08:04.776 --> 08:05.526
Locked.

08:10.705 --> 08:11.705
We're in.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.037
Job well done, boys.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.741
We have enough fish to last forever.

08:35.866 --> 08:37.292
Fish, fish...

08:37.855 --> 08:38.767
fish!

08:40.855 --> 08:43.522
One small problem.

08:43.946 --> 08:46.198
We could not allow for you
to return to eating

08:46.323 --> 08:49.320
the savage-smelling, foul-fuming
fishy fish.

08:52.954 --> 08:56.914
I planned to come up with
my own carefully planned plan,

08:57.287 --> 09:00.471
to plan to steal
the stinkies ourselves.

09:05.099 --> 09:08.474
And my plan
all went accordingly... to plan.

09:09.091 --> 09:12.383
You see, we have the crates
with the real fish

09:12.552 --> 09:16.222
while yours are filled
with only the phony fish cakes.

09:20.158 --> 09:22.233
Nice try, ringtail,

09:22.358 --> 09:24.839
but I know
how much you hate the smell of fish.

09:24.964 --> 09:27.107
I was expecting a move like that,

09:27.276 --> 09:30.653
which is why I switched the crates
before you even got back to the zoo.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.963
But I was expecting you
to be expecting that,

09:36.647 --> 09:39.026
so we switcheroo-ed the crates
on the pier

09:39.151 --> 09:41.353
before the fish
got loading onto the truck.

09:41.841 --> 09:44.833
It doesn't really matter,
because I just switched these crates

09:45.001 --> 09:46.627
during your last flashback.

09:46.796 --> 09:49.213
I switched them while you were saying
you switched them.

09:49.382 --> 09:51.384
And I switched them
the last time you blinked.

09:51.509 --> 09:54.595
But I pretended to switch them,
so you actually switched them back.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.012
- But I double switched.
- And I triple switched.

09:57.180 --> 10:00.126
- I million zillion switched.
- I switched them to infinity,

10:00.251 --> 10:02.226
so you have to shut up a little bit.

10:03.271 --> 10:07.189
What you didn't see coming
is that I am actually you.

10:08.965 --> 10:11.484
Nicely played, but if you are me,

10:11.609 --> 10:14.910
then by processing of elimination,
I must be you.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.642
Maybe. Maybe.

10:16.767 --> 10:20.262
But if you are me, and I am you,
then we must both be...

10:20.387 --> 10:21.387
Enough.

10:21.627 --> 10:25.627
Can we just crack these babies open
and get this over with already, please?

10:34.092 --> 10:37.052
Fish cakes?
They're all the phony fish cakes.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.847
So I am the winner.

10:40.343 --> 10:41.985
Right?
I think so.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.604
Can we get an official ruling on this
so I can better enjoy my gloating?

10:46.773 --> 10:48.397
But where are the real fish?

10:49.227 --> 10:50.761
I have a theory.

10:58.390 --> 10:59.581
Suckers.
