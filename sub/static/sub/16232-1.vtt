00:20.040 --> 00:24.795
Yes, it is fact. I've been living my
whole life in this area, honest!

00:28.080 --> 00:30.275
It's strange, I'm
came out here before.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.677
I would like to Paris.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.754
I've been out there.

00:34.920 --> 00:35.830
Really?

00:37.200 --> 00:39.191
They had determined
a lovely time.

00:39.720 --> 00:43.474
Drink champagne, yes.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.154
Thanks again for coming
to my side of town.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.425
It's my pleasure.

00:47.426 --> 00:51.290
I know I told you I hadn't had
much luck with these internet dates.

00:51.325 --> 00:53.441
After our phone conversation, I thought

00:53.476 --> 00:55.700
meeting in person
would be a good idea.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.473
A very good idea.

00:57.560 --> 01:04.372
Usually people lie about what
they look like, but you didn't.

01:04.760 --> 01:05.988
Neither did you.

01:07.020 --> 01:09.231
Mind if I excuse
myself for a moment?

01:34.840 --> 01:36.034
We shouldn't ...

01:49.920 --> 01:51.911
Sorry, I got to cut
things short, but I ...

01:52.040 --> 01:53.519
I ... I got to go.

01:54.960 --> 01:56.188
What do you mean?

01:56.320 --> 01:59.448
It was really nice to meet you.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.434
Can't stay and
talk for a while, huh?

02:03.600 --> 02:05.352
I really have to go.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.795
This is Jessica, leave a message.

02:26.280 --> 02:30.608
Hey, it's me. Call me.  I like
this one. We need to talk.

03:14.302 --> 03:16.691
<i>Searchers found the body
of Shania D. Dishonavish</i>

03:16.692 --> 03:17.966

03:17.967 --> 03:18.967
<i>... continued have the end,</i>

03:18.968 --> 03:20.568

03:23.693 --> 03:26.231

03:28.960 --> 03:31.926
<i>It seems right now the witnesses

03:32.020 --> 03:34.185
<i>All the victims seem
to have met the killer</i>

03:34.186 --> 03:37.239

03:37.240 --> 03:39.119
<i>These women are very vulnerable to</i>

03:46.560 --> 03:48.906
<i>The investigation is ongoing.</i>

03:55.460 --> 03:57.551
I thought our date
was going so well.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.075
We should continue,
don't you think?

04:08.560 --> 04:10.318
Where are you taking me?

04:11.680 --> 04:16.637
Some place nice.
I think you'll like it.

04:40.580 --> 04:41.749
Here we are.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.552
Ha, ha, where are you going?

04:55.980 --> 04:57.959
Are you going to kill me?

04:58.160 --> 05:01.516
What?  What kind of
person do you think I am?

05:02.880 --> 05:05.350
I thought you'd like
to see some of my work.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.574
I ... pulled that
one from the river.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.294
The woman's body had
been submerged for weeks.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.676
It is said that her husband
tried to bury her in the mud.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.749
How awful that
must have been for him.

05:21.560 --> 05:24.832
Hey, ever seen what
water does to a body?

05:34.440 --> 05:37.783
No! No! No!

05:38.600 --> 05:40.272
Hey! Hey! Hey!

05:40.600 --> 05:43.414
Do not make me
do it again, okay?

05:44.560 --> 05:45.595
Okay.

05:47.140 --> 05:50.079
Alright now!  Okay, listen!

05:54.560 --> 05:55.875
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

05:57.360 --> 06:00.193
I think you'll
really going to like it.

06:01.880 --> 06:02.910
No!

06:17.200 --> 06:18.833
I'll be right back.

09:30.860 --> 09:35.272
I'll give you anything you want!
Just let me go!

09:35.460 --> 09:38.752
Anything?
You don't even know me!

09:43.060 --> 09:45.355
I don't even know
your favourite colour!

10:29.700 --> 10:33.688
Hey! Don't blow the
moment for both of us, okay?

10:58.400 --> 10:59.894
I like green.

11:33.180 --> 11:35.855
Here we go, come on.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.449
Stupid, I don't think ... stupid!

14:07.840 --> 14:10.515
Hell ... Hello?

16:50.480 --> 16:53.619
Where you think you're going, huh?

17:43.040 --> 17:44.534
Help!

17:51.000 --> 17:53.275
Help! Please!

18:10.960 --> 18:11.956
Oh shit!

18:47.480 --> 18:48.949
Fucking door!

19:20.840 --> 19:22.159
Julia!

19:57.880 --> 19:59.169
Stop it!

20:07.640 --> 20:08.950
Here you go!

20:11.960 --> 20:14.151
I've really been
enjoying our time together.

20:17.440 --> 20:18.993
Want some tea?

20:19.360 --> 20:22.393
I know you'd prefer coffee,
but I don't have that.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.709
I have a confession to make.

20:27.865 --> 20:30.797
At least we don't have girls here.

20:31.280 --> 20:35.319
That really makes you vulnerable,
sharing spaces, you know?

20:35.340 --> 20:37.815
How can you trust these days?

20:38.080 --> 20:39.979
One minute you're having coffee

20:39.980 --> 20:43.811
and in the next minute
your heart is broken.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.510
I shouldn't be so insensitive.

20:46.540 --> 20:48.139
It's a little late for that now.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.729
You are right.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.674
My manners are not
what they used to be.

20:54.280 --> 20:58.555
But it's stupid cunts like
you that make me like this.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.972
That was uncalled for.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.415
Fuck you!

21:09.280 --> 21:12.970
You're not running the show,
yeah, you're not that special.

21:14.680 --> 21:19.815
You actually have a fucked up,
excuse me, screwed up smile!

21:20.960 --> 21:25.039
You've got that one,
teeth like that, not straight.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.957
You'd better
just fix some of it now.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.450
I've had prettier dates than you.

21:41.320 --> 21:44.534
This is my show,
I'm running this!

21:47.060 --> 21:48.395
Told you that?

21:52.120 --> 21:53.209
Coward!

21:53.640 --> 21:54.536
What?

21:54.560 --> 21:58.273
If you're going to kill me,
just go ahead an do it.

21:59.034 --> 22:00.867
We're having such a good time.

22:04.277 --> 22:06.313
You want to leave.  I know ...

22:06.757 --> 22:07.753
What?

22:07.997 --> 22:10.895
Escape.  You're mapping a way out.

22:11.877 --> 22:17.088
I'd be careful.  It's a
dangerous road out there.

23:46.360 --> 23:48.890
Julia!

23:51.460 --> 23:55.548
Julia, there's no place to go!

23:56.780 --> 23:59.197
Julia!

24:00.641 --> 24:04.580
Come out, come out!
Wherever you are.

24:12.361 --> 24:17.635
Julia!  You are a bad, bad girl!

24:17.661 --> 24:19.435
Fuck you!

28:36.549 --> 28:37.823
Funny girl!

30:49.552 --> 30:52.786
What took you so long?
I started to get worried.

30:53.653 --> 30:54.947
I'm fine.

30:54.973 --> 30:56.431
You don't look fine.

30:56.713 --> 31:00.852
He just caught me off
guard a little, that's all.

31:01.473 --> 31:03.570
I wasn't expecting
it to go this far.

31:03.573 --> 31:05.130
Jules, are you sure
what we are doing?

31:05.133 --> 31:08.306
Enough, Jessica.
I've got it under control.

31:09.413 --> 31:11.643
Just help me
put him in the trunk.

31:25.554 --> 31:26.923
Are you ready?

31:27.534 --> 31:28.803
Yeah!

32:08.995 --> 32:11.131
How you really pissed him off.

32:11.215 --> 32:12.968
Just help me get
him out of the trunk.

32:15.055 --> 32:17.205
I'm not sure
about this thing, Jules.

32:17.335 --> 32:19.207
What are you not sure about?

32:22.215 --> 32:26.713
You don't fucking move unless
I tell you to!   You got it?

32:29.975 --> 32:32.310
It looks like we got
a real nasty one, Jules!

32:32.315 --> 32:34.015
He's a real peach, alright!

32:35.136 --> 32:36.789
What happened?
- Hey!

32:38.816 --> 32:41.574
Help me get this
piece of shit inside.

32:47.156 --> 32:48.711
He's heavy!

32:50.176 --> 32:53.024
Oh! Fuck!

32:53.059 --> 32:55.755
- Jessie, I'm sorry.
- Fine.  Just get him inside.

33:13.197 --> 33:14.705
Sleep tight!

34:08.678 --> 34:10.612
Just get it over with.

34:17.259 --> 34:18.431
Oh my God!

34:18.759 --> 34:20.251
Found our next guy.

34:21.659 --> 34:22.714
What?

34:24.319 --> 34:28.571
After we get rid of this one, I get
someone new to take his place.

34:28.739 --> 34:30.318
Got him in a chat room.

34:30.779 --> 34:32.670
You know, we don't do that.

34:32.899 --> 34:35.329
He sent me a picture of his dick.

34:35.819 --> 34:38.478
So?  It always happens.

34:38.599 --> 34:42.248
Yeah, but you didn't see it
though.  It was so wrinkled

34:42.250 --> 34:45.531
and he was wearing a dress.

34:46.139 --> 34:47.956
That's disgusting.

34:48.599 --> 34:49.649
Here.

34:52.060 --> 34:53.215
Watch it!

34:54.120 --> 34:56.251
I was just trying to help.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.257
You can't go after every guy,

34:58.280 --> 35:00.336
who says something sexual
to you in a chat room,

35:00.460 --> 35:02.557
or sends you a
picture of his penis.

35:05.720 --> 35:08.614
I thought we were
going get rid of their kinds.

35:20.260 --> 35:21.290
Get up!

35:26.381 --> 35:28.956
I said, get up!

35:30.441 --> 35:33.100
I'm going to
fuck you up, man!

35:33.101 --> 35:35.119
I'm looking forward to it.

37:44.225 --> 37:45.614
Oh!  Fuck!

37:46.145 --> 37:49.143
Hey asshole, looking for something?

37:54.905 --> 37:56.599
How about a hammer?

38:21.426 --> 38:23.696
I thought you wanted to play?

38:49.966 --> 38:51.898
Who's your little friend?

39:05.187 --> 39:07.084
Did you kill him?
- No.

39:07.347 --> 39:08.499
Why not?

39:08.500 --> 39:10.385
Because he doesn't
deserves a quick death.

39:10.547 --> 39:12.902
Okay, fine, but then
I want to kill him.

39:13.027 --> 39:14.176
You're not killing him.

39:14.267 --> 39:16.513
I have just as much
right to this, as you do.

39:17.414 --> 39:21.397
- This is such a bull shit.
- Deal with it.

40:12.509 --> 40:13.539
Jessica!

40:26.969 --> 40:28.338
Fuck you!

41:05.790 --> 41:10.069
Good, you're awake!

41:13.431 --> 41:17.041
Hell of a situation you
got yourself into here.

41:20.471 --> 41:24.211
I wonder what you thought
you were going to do with me.

41:24.212 --> 41:26.386
You're fucking stupid!

41:29.331 --> 41:32.628
I didn't catch that.

41:36.671 --> 41:42.006
Maybe you were going to
break me, huh?  Torture me.

41:42.091 --> 41:44.050
Me me your trophy?

41:49.412 --> 41:54.203
Is this the best shit
you can come up with?

41:57.732 --> 41:59.262
You are all the same.

42:00.897 --> 42:04.608
Just because a
woman smiles at you

42:04.609 --> 42:08.525
or says hello, doesn't mean
she wants to fuck you!

42:08.552 --> 42:12.481
You don't own her
and you don't own me!

42:29.293 --> 42:31.809
Interesting music choice.

42:31.910 --> 42:33.963
Oh, I like it.

42:41.533 --> 42:46.004
When I say I'm going
to fuck you up, I mean it!

42:48.773 --> 42:50.631
Watch him for a minute.

43:14.394 --> 43:16.744
I know you want to touch me.

43:26.595 --> 43:28.813
You want to have me, don't you?

43:37.155 --> 43:45.812
Now, you are thinking very
dirty thoughts about me!

43:55.555 --> 43:57.666
Do you wanna taste me?

44:02.156 --> 44:04.108
Do you wanna fuck me?

44:09.816 --> 44:11.695
But you won't kill me.

44:16.856 --> 44:18.150
What are you doing?

44:22.736 --> 44:24.389
That's my bra!

44:25.256 --> 44:28.115
Yeah, well, it looks better on me!

44:28.116 --> 44:29.988
Stop being so childish!

44:31.696 --> 44:33.375
Cover yourself up!

44:35.437 --> 44:37.892
What?  Do my tits bother you?

44:43.877 --> 44:46.352
Please let her continue.

44:52.317 --> 44:57.366
What the fuck was that about?
I'm talking to you.

44:57.497 --> 45:00.086
Why can't we just
get rid of him already?

45:01.217 --> 45:03.109
Soon, okay?

45:04.317 --> 45:06.733
When do I get to
be the bait for once?

45:07.337 --> 45:09.993
You know how
I feel about that.

45:10.378 --> 45:12.833
I can take care of myself.

45:14.118 --> 45:16.637
I made a promise to
myself a long time ago,

45:16.638 --> 45:18.836
that I would never let
anybody hurt you again.

45:19.058 --> 45:21.916
You can't always be
there to take care of me.

45:22.038 --> 45:25.528
You have to trust I
can take care of myself.

45:26.878 --> 45:31.349
It's not about trust,
you're my baby sister.

45:32.118 --> 45:35.933
You have to stop
treating me like I'm a baby.

45:37.318 --> 45:41.550
I'm tired of it.
Stop worrying about me.

45:43.139 --> 45:49.148
I can't.  Look, I don't want
to fight right now, Jessie.

45:49.159 --> 45:51.062
Too tired.

46:47.300 --> 46:48.469
Hello.

46:56.941 --> 46:58.120
How can I help you?

46:58.281 --> 46:59.919
I live  in the house
across the street.

46:59.941 --> 47:02.609
Yeah, I've seen you before.

47:03.281 --> 47:06.757
I think, maybe, you could
help me out with something.

47:11.241 --> 47:12.894
What were you looking for?

47:13.281 --> 47:16.080
It's my bike,
I'm having trouble with it.

47:16.081 --> 47:18.192
I thought maybe you
could take a look at it.

47:18.361 --> 47:20.479
Yeah, a bike?

47:22.321 --> 47:24.637
That, I  mean,
if you're not too busy.

47:28.402 --> 47:30.370
Yeah, I think I could
spare a few minutes.

47:31.971 --> 47:34.205
What seems to be the problem?

47:38.782 --> 47:41.371
Some days I just
can't even get it started.

47:41.482 --> 47:47.593
And I, crank it and crank
it, and it just sits there.

47:50.922 --> 47:52.601
Maybe I'm doing it wrong.

47:53.782 --> 47:55.561
I think you are doing just fine.

47:55.942 --> 48:00.853
It sounds like the gasoline is turning
into varnish inside the carburetor.

48:00.854 --> 48:02.356
Boring stuff, but

48:02.423 --> 48:05.083
isn't a problem.

48:05.103 --> 48:07.876
That's really sweet of you
to help me out like this.

48:09.043 --> 48:11.711
Maybe there's
something I can do for you?

48:16.583 --> 48:18.116
What do you have in mind?

48:20.163 --> 48:22.094
Maybe we could play a game.

48:23.383 --> 48:24.460
Yeah?

48:24.463 --> 48:26.142
Do you like games?

48:29.003 --> 48:30.641
I do now.

48:37.124 --> 48:38.234
Come here.

48:42.884 --> 48:44.119
Turn around.

48:54.324 --> 48:57.316
What's going on?

48:57.544 --> 49:02.154
Just playing.
Don't you trust me?

49:04.304 --> 49:06.320
I don't even know your name.

49:07.224 --> 49:08.837
What do you want it to be?

49:09.365 --> 49:12.557
Wow!  You playing like that, huh?

49:16.325 --> 49:20.557
Rose.  Always liked that name.

49:21.885 --> 49:23.605
Whatever you say.

49:25.029 --> 49:27.082
So listen.  You be a good boy.

49:27.805 --> 49:31.800
Rose has some surprises.

49:31.805 --> 49:33.154
Yeah?

49:34.265 --> 49:36.317
Let the games begin!

49:39.565 --> 49:42.083
Just a little bit further.

49:44.366 --> 49:46.322
Okay, oh.

49:48.186 --> 49:49.441
Okay.

49:55.386 --> 49:56.396
Okay.

50:02.806 --> 50:04.225
Hold still.

50:13.746 --> 50:17.675
I've never done this before.

50:18.927 --> 50:20.858
Sure you'll be great at it.

50:43.407 --> 50:48.483
Now you stay right here,
Rose is gonna be right back.

50:53.388 --> 50:54.737
I'll be waiting.

50:55.848 --> 50:57.327
Obviously.

51:07.888 --> 51:10.104
Strange girl.
- Oh Shit!

51:10.968 --> 51:14.984
What the fuck man?
Who's there?

51:15.268 --> 51:16.717
What's your name?

51:17.808 --> 51:20.766
Sam, what's yours?

51:20.788 --> 51:22.767
You going to have sex with her?

51:22.768 --> 51:25.263
What?  What's going on here, huh?

51:25.428 --> 51:30.683
Well, Sam.  We're tied up.

51:30.849 --> 51:34.468
We're sitting in the kitchen
of a sexually active girl.

51:34.469 --> 51:38.703
So, what do you
think is going on here?

51:38.769 --> 51:41.500
Look man.  I'm not
into this kinky shit, huh.

51:41.549 --> 51:44.561
I was just trying to
help a girl fix her bike.

51:44.589 --> 51:47.906
You wanted to give her engine
a little crank then, huh?

51:48.769 --> 51:50.300
Yeah, something like that.

51:50.309 --> 51:52.245
I wonder what they
gonna do with you.

51:52.269 --> 51:53.206
They?

51:54.689 --> 52:00.845
There's more than one girl, Sam.
And they have a lot of energy.

52:00.930 --> 52:04.249
Okay, well, you sound like
you know what's going on.

52:04.250 --> 52:07.017
What ... what are
they gonna do, huh?

52:07.118 --> 52:09.139
What are they gonna do, man?

52:09.140 --> 52:15.239
Well, if you're lucky, maybe
they'll have their way with you.

52:15.330 --> 52:17.525
They would have
shown me a good time.

52:17.690 --> 52:19.567
You had sex with both of them?

52:20.570 --> 52:27.408
Oh, Sam, I've done things with these
girls that you won't even believe.

52:27.530 --> 52:31.603
Okay, okay, it's ...
I just, you know, I've ...

52:34.210 --> 52:37.187
I've never been with two girls.

52:37.211 --> 52:40.209
Well then maybe,
this is your lucky day.

52:53.551 --> 52:54.501
Jessica?

52:55.011 --> 52:57.100
Still worth listening?

52:57.531 --> 53:04.821
Yeah, are you gonna be joining us?

53:04.851 --> 53:07.863
I don't know.
Is that something you want?

53:08.131 --> 53:12.808
What?  No, no, God,
no!  I  just ... no!  It's ...

53:14.772 --> 53:19.766
No offense, but I ...
you know I don't do guys.

53:19.892 --> 53:22.130
Well, it doesn't sound
like you doing anybody.

53:22.132 --> 53:24.130
I do fine, thank you very much.

53:24.132 --> 53:31.727
You see all these women that you've
been with, they wanna choke them.

53:31.892 --> 53:34.725
Like, during sex?

53:35.012 --> 53:36.470
Whenever ..

53:36.471 --> 53:39.950
Wait, is that what they
want me to fucking do here?

53:39.992 --> 53:42.400
Some girls are into
that sort of thing.

53:42.412 --> 53:47.946
Look man, I don't know
what kind of girls you date

53:48.113 --> 53:50.581
but this is some weird ass shit.

53:50.653 --> 53:54.163
Depends on your point of view.

53:56.473 --> 53:57.608
Jessica.

54:00.693 --> 54:02.167
What are you doing?

54:02.813 --> 54:05.381
I'm really sleepy, I
want to go to bed now.

54:06.813 --> 54:08.610
Why are you dressed like that?

54:10.613 --> 54:14.501
Answer me!
Why are you dressed like that?

54:20.294 --> 54:23.643
Rose!  Hey, Rose!  Listen.

54:25.144 --> 54:27.574
I don't know what you
have in mind here, but

54:27.634 --> 54:30.229
this is starting to
freak me out, okay?

54:30.814 --> 54:33.005
I am not into this kind of shit, just

54:33.006 --> 54:35.639
... if you could just
let me go, I swear to ...

54:35.640 --> 54:37.008
Who the fuck is this?

54:37.134 --> 54:39.125
I don't know,
I didn't get his name.

54:39.254 --> 54:40.607
It's Sam.

54:40.694 --> 54:43.985
Shut the fuck up, I wasn't talking
to you.  What is he doing here?

54:44.020 --> 54:46.394
Apparently, he's here
to fix her motorcycle.

54:46.474 --> 54:49.871
Speak again and I will staple
your fucking mouth shut!

54:52.235 --> 54:55.905
Get in the hallway.
Get in the fucking hallway!

55:01.275 --> 55:03.411
Who the fuck is that, man?

55:05.095 --> 55:06.528
That was the other girl.

55:06.695 --> 55:10.026
Look at you.  Fucking stupid.
Who is this guy?

55:10.275 --> 55:14.000
I do not know.  I found him in
the garage across the street.

55:14.095 --> 55:17.426
You brought a local here?
Are you completely fucking insane?

55:17.755 --> 55:19.170
It's so fucked!

55:23.415 --> 55:24.814
You headed somewhere?

55:24.935 --> 55:26.288
Did anybody see you?

55:26.736 --> 55:28.125
I don't know.

55:29.776 --> 55:36.714
Damn it Jessica, what were
you planning on doing with him?

55:40.316 --> 55:41.769
Killing him.

55:42.296 --> 55:43.875
How did you end up here?

55:44.456 --> 55:48.151
I am on a date with Rose's sister.

55:48.276 --> 55:49.529
This is a date?

55:49.736 --> 55:53.695
Yeah, so far it's been
a pretty decent good one.

55:53.816 --> 55:55.349
You gotta bring him back.

55:55.796 --> 55:57.011
I'm not doing that.

55:57.176 --> 55:58.404
Yes, you are!

55:58.616 --> 56:01.177
Stop telling me what to do.

56:01.237 --> 56:03.373
Okay, I can make my own decisions!

56:03.457 --> 56:08.048
I don't know who's crazier.
The people that are doing this to us,

56:08.437 --> 56:10.289
or the people who fell for it.

56:10.377 --> 56:14.629
I like you, Sam.  You're smart.

56:17.997 --> 56:19.350
Too bad.

56:19.377 --> 56:23.465
What?   No, why did
you say, "too bad"?

56:25.017 --> 56:26.072
Hey?

56:26.497 --> 56:27.628
What does that mean, too bad?

56:27.629 --> 56:30.327
You meant something by that!
What does that mean?

56:30.337 --> 56:32.767
You know something,
I know you know something!

56:32.768 --> 56:34.933
You know something, tell me!

56:34.968 --> 56:36.995
Are you mad that I
brought home my own kill,

56:36.998 --> 56:40.795
or you're just jealous because
I did it without any of your help?

56:41.138 --> 56:44.853
Oh, you can't be serious.
Grow up!

56:46.098 --> 56:48.971
I'm trying to,
but you won't let me.

56:50.098 --> 56:55.333
Oh God, stop!  What are you
going to do?  What's going on?

56:55.698 --> 56:59.634
Hey, what's going on?  Please, please,
whatever you're going to do, don't do it!

57:01.698 --> 57:06.176
Here, you want blood so bad.
You got it.  Here you go.

57:06.338 --> 57:09.690
No! No. No, no, no, no.
No blood!

57:09.699 --> 57:11.655
No blood, no blood, please!

57:11.739 --> 57:13.898
Please, no blood!
What is going ...?

57:13.899 --> 57:16.055
What's going on?
What are you doing?

57:17.159 --> 57:18.487
I'm killing.  You shut up.

57:18.559 --> 57:21.218
No, no, no, please, Rose!
I beg you.

57:21.219 --> 57:23.855
My name is not Rose!

57:25.539 --> 57:27.655
That's a fat chicks name!

57:35.239 --> 57:36.918
What's so funny?

57:37.579 --> 57:39.217
You don't got the guts.

57:42.239 --> 57:44.908
Well, maybe I should
just start with you then?

58:04.040 --> 58:05.195
Holy shit!

58:10.860 --> 58:14.077
Oh! You fucking bitch,
I'm going to kill you!

58:14.278 --> 58:15.865
Fucking kill you.

58:18.101 --> 58:21.855
Okay.  Fucking kill you!
- Okay, you can stop now.

58:21.981 --> 58:24.449
- Just let go of me!
- Don't proof anything to me!

58:24.901 --> 58:26.420
Can't you see I'm working here?

58:28.461 --> 58:29.940
Jessica, enough.

58:31.461 --> 58:32.689
Get out of my way!

58:35.461 --> 58:37.638
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

58:37.741 --> 58:41.814
Yeah, you too.
I'm just like you.

58:43.481 --> 58:47.482
Look, you let me take care of them.
You go relax.

58:50.541 --> 58:52.533
Look alive, Sam.

58:54.242 --> 58:55.557
Leave him alone!

59:00.902 --> 59:02.540
Yeah, leave me alone!

59:07.262 --> 59:08.999
Help! Help!

59:09.000 --> 59:10.300
Shut up!
If you scream again,

59:10.342 --> 59:12.100
I will fucking cut your tongue out!

59:12.102 --> 59:15.212
Why are you doing?
What did I ever do to you?

59:15.302 --> 59:18.380
No, no, no, no.
I ask the questions!

59:18.382 --> 59:20.259
Just kill the poor kid, already!

59:20.260 --> 59:21.591
Fuck you, man!

59:23.102 --> 59:28.894
Oh, no, no.
No, that won't be fun. No.

59:29.463 --> 59:32.093
No, we want to take
our time, don't we, Sam?

01:00:00.303 --> 01:00:05.314
My sister may be done
playing with you, but I'm not!

01:00:35.685 --> 01:00:37.413
Can't breathe.

01:00:39.785 --> 01:00:47.024
Hey, man, you okay?
Are you fucking alive?

01:00:48.505 --> 01:00:49.974
Are you even alive?

01:00:52.405 --> 01:00:53.515
Oh, thank God!

01:00:54.625 --> 01:00:59.979
Okay, listen, man.  Listen.
I can't move.

01:01:00.105 --> 01:01:04.940
So maybe you can make
your way over to me.  Okay.

01:01:05.185 --> 01:01:08.187
Just ... just stroot over to me,
and you can get me undone,

01:01:08.188 --> 01:01:09.974
and then I'll fucking
get you undone, man.

01:01:11.106 --> 01:01:17.779
Come on, come on!  Just stroot
over to me, just stroot over!

01:01:26.906 --> 01:01:27.697
What?

01:01:31.386 --> 01:01:32.475
Come on.

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:41.799
I don't want anything to
do with this.  Just let me go!

01:01:53.227 --> 01:01:55.004
Yeah, yeah, here come on!

01:02:25.788 --> 01:02:27.077
What is that?

01:02:30.408 --> 01:02:34.517
Hey man, are you free?

01:02:36.768 --> 01:02:38.820
Hey, what are you doing?

01:02:40.188 --> 01:02:42.856
Holy shit, you're free., man.
You are free!  Come on!

01:02:43.088 --> 01:02:45.477
Okay, okay.
Now let me go!

01:02:45.548 --> 01:02:48.367
Let me go, man!  Come on.
They're gonna come back!

01:02:48.868 --> 01:02:51.220
Look, I'll just fucking
walk out, okay.

01:02:51.228 --> 01:02:52.980
I swear to God, I'll just walk out.

01:02:52.989 --> 01:02:54.980
I'll let you get back to your date,

01:02:54.989 --> 01:02:56.500
or whatever the
shit you're doing here.

01:02:56.509 --> 01:03:00.360
Just ... just untie me!  Come on,
please and just fucking let me go!

01:03:00.369 --> 01:03:02.345
Man, I swear to God,
I'll just walk out of here

01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:03.982
won't ask any questions!

01:03:04.749 --> 01:03:07.580
Come on, man!
What is that?

01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:09.784
What is that?
What are you doing?

01:03:11.149 --> 01:03:13.424
Come on, man, come on, please.

01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:15.301
I swear to God, please.

01:03:15.429 --> 01:03:18.666
Please!  Just untie me, man.
Untie me!

01:03:18.989 --> 01:03:22.140
You can have both of them, man.
Come on, just let me go!

01:03:25.149 --> 01:03:28.579
What is that?

01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:33.741
What is that?

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:38.589
What's going on?
Just let me go, man!

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:41.640
Just ... just let me go!

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:45.460
Yeah?

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:49.585
Please!

01:03:56.650 --> 01:03:58.078
Oh my God!

01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:05.830
Take care, Sam!

01:05:55.314 --> 01:05:56.906
How the hell did he get free?

01:05:57.074 --> 01:05:58.427
How should I know?

01:05:58.514 --> 01:06:00.113
You were the last one with him.

01:06:04.274 --> 01:06:05.373
Where is your friend?

01:06:05.534 --> 01:06:06.828
I do not know!

01:06:11.354 --> 01:06:12.682
What's this?

01:06:13.234 --> 01:06:14.249
Wire cutters.

01:06:14.274 --> 01:06:16.929
Yeah, I know what they are.
How the fuck did he get them?

01:06:19.755 --> 01:06:22.130
My sister asked you a question!

01:06:24.235 --> 01:06:27.324
I don't fucking know.
He just walked out.

01:06:35.015 --> 01:06:38.329
I'm going to have to rip out that
fucking, lying tongue of yours!

01:06:40.655 --> 01:06:44.106
I don't give a fuck about him!
We need to find our friend.

01:06:46.635 --> 01:06:52.332
Fine.  I'll cut it out later.
Lucky Sammy!

01:07:10.076 --> 01:07:12.246
I don't know how
this could have happened.

01:07:13.336 --> 01:07:17.588
Well, it obviously did,
so we'll just find him, okay?

01:07:21.976 --> 01:07:24.371
He's probably half
way down the block.

01:07:24.976 --> 01:07:27.053
Oh, he didn't leave.

01:07:27.837 --> 01:07:29.495
How do you know?

01:07:30.757 --> 01:07:32.210
Because I do.

01:07:57.717 --> 01:07:59.828
You think this is
my fault, don't you?

01:08:01.017 --> 01:08:02.048
What?

01:08:02.118 --> 01:08:04.274
You don't believe me,
you never believed me!

01:08:04.398 --> 01:08:06.614
Be quiet!  I believe you!

01:08:15.298 --> 01:08:19.367
Do you see him?
I told you he left.

01:08:21.558 --> 01:08:27.228
No, he wants to stay for the
same reason we want him here.

01:08:28.298 --> 01:08:29.466
Well.

01:08:47.679 --> 01:08:51.808
Want to come play in my room?
Will be more fun, don't you think?

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:37.871
Oh, oh, please, don't kill me!

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.354
Just leave.

01:10:50.722 --> 01:10:52.740
You like that, you fucker?

01:10:55.943 --> 01:10:58.712
Oh, God it's so good!

01:11:11.103 --> 01:11:13.876
- It takes treat all your needs?
- Only the ones that get laid!

01:11:13.963 --> 01:11:18.534
Oh, what are we now?  But you
don't even know anything about me!

01:11:18.603 --> 01:11:20.595
Where do I begin?

01:11:20.763 --> 01:11:23.596
I bet you didn't know
my favorite color was pink!

01:11:24.323 --> 01:11:26.593
Let's just keep
this physical, okay!

01:11:27.564 --> 01:11:31.857
It is rude to interrupt a girl
when she has a window to do!

01:11:32.404 --> 01:11:35.821
I've stopped listening to
bitches like you a long time ago!

01:11:36.164 --> 01:11:39.461
Excuse me, I wasn't
done talking yet!

01:11:56.824 --> 01:11:59.154
So pink is your
favourite colour, huh?

01:11:59.944 --> 01:12:02.240
I always pegged
you for a yellow girl.

01:12:03.425 --> 01:12:04.694
Shut up.

01:12:15.925 --> 01:12:18.016
You're not the first
asshole I have killed.

01:12:18.045 --> 01:12:19.519
I'm not dead yet!

01:12:20.565 --> 01:12:22.676
I want to be rescued by "Mr.Right"!

01:12:24.145 --> 01:12:26.805
I want the bad stuff to
go away and get fixed!

01:12:27.465 --> 01:12:29.562
I want someone who gets me!

01:12:34.125 --> 01:12:35.804
I want to sing in the rain

01:12:36.566 --> 01:12:39.182
and be with someone who does too.

01:12:49.546 --> 01:12:51.582
I just want my soul-mate.

01:12:53.926 --> 01:12:58.044
I just want someone to
tell me that I'm beautiful,

01:12:58.166 --> 01:13:00.700
inside or out.

01:13:09.046 --> 01:13:10.765
You know what, though?

01:13:10.927 --> 01:13:15.543
You really are pretty.
And I love Mexican food.

01:13:23.327 --> 01:13:25.338
You no one will ever get you.

01:13:26.047 --> 01:13:27.500
But only me!

01:13:29.647 --> 01:13:33.223
You're not my first
either, but you're my ...

01:13:40.367 --> 01:13:42.722
I'm sorry.  Did that hurt?

01:13:52.868 --> 01:13:54.786
Shall we continue?

01:13:55.788 --> 01:14:00.086
I love "The Sound of Music",
but hated "Mary Poppins"!

01:14:01.528 --> 01:14:04.586
Andrews was such a
brat in that movie!

01:14:07.168 --> 01:14:11.261
Julie Andrews is a
national fucking treasure?

01:14:17.648 --> 01:14:19.328
Is that all you've got?

01:14:19.349 --> 01:14:21.300
Oh, I thought you were
going to fuck me up?

01:14:21.301 --> 01:14:22.696
Ah, I never wanted to fuck you up,

01:14:22.697 --> 01:14:24.540
I just want to fucking kill you.

01:14:51.389 --> 01:14:53.625
Just playing with you, old man.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.802
Date's over.

01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:23.329
How could you?

01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:24.750
Come here, come here!

01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:28.487
Oh God! Oh God!

01:15:29.488 --> 01:15:31.570
You won't listen!
Now be silent!

01:15:31.571 --> 01:15:33.807
I told you, you
gotta listen!

01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:35.828
Why don't you listen?
Shut up!

01:15:44.351 --> 01:15:48.524
Come on, come on!
Shut up!

01:15:53.131 --> 01:15:55.469
A little help here, Jess!

01:15:57.431 --> 01:15:58.520
Jessie!

01:16:19.772 --> 01:16:21.261
Jess.

01:16:48.173 --> 01:16:49.701
Why?

01:16:51.233 --> 01:16:52.786
It's my turn.

01:17:40.094 --> 01:17:42.291
The best date I ever had.

01:19:37.238 --> 01:19:38.368
Goodbye.

01:22:02.342 --> 01:22:03.431
For you.

01:22:05.022 --> 01:22:06.396
Thanks for coming here.

01:22:06.522 --> 01:22:07.637
Thank you.

01:22:09.942 --> 01:22:12.394
I haven't had much luck
with these internet dates.

01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:15.858
It just seems like
everybody's out to fuck me.

01:22:16.193 --> 01:22:18.954
Or maybe I'm just being paranoid.

01:22:20.223 --> 01:22:24.149
I know what you mean.
So tell me about yourself.

01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:26.394
There's not really much to say.

01:22:28.983 --> 01:22:32.553
Julia Y.   So, what
does the "Y" stand for?

01:22:32.783 --> 01:22:36.419
Oh, that's for me to know,
and for you to find out.

01:22:37.783 --> 01:22:40.338
Well, I look
forward to finding out.

01:22:51.993 --> 01:22:54.013
You want to fuck with Daddy?

01:22:58.524 --> 01:23:00.460
Ah, you like it
rough, don't you?

01:23:00.644 --> 01:23:02.362
Yeah, you like it, don't you?

01:23:04.944 --> 01:23:08.570
Yes, he does like that shit, too, Babe!
Give it up for him!

01:23:11.104 --> 01:23:12.639
Get over there, bitch!

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:19.597
Ah, that's what you want,
eh you slut?   Ain't it, slut!

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.776
You want that chocolate
stick, don't you, huh?

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:25.749
Huh you little slut, huh?
You like that don't you?

01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:27.705
Inside your ass, pussy ...

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.615
Yeah, alright!

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.000
Excuse you.
