04:17.019 --> 04:19.100
Honey...

04:19.180 --> 04:21.140
what's the matter?

04:23.980 --> 04:25.380
Nothing.

04:25.460 --> 04:28.380
It's my stomach.

04:29.820 --> 04:31.980
I hope it's not an ulcer.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.620
You're sweating.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.620
Another nightmare?

04:38.660 --> 04:40.220
No...

04:40.260 --> 04:42.100
the same one.

04:44.060 --> 04:46.260
Paul?

04:47.740 --> 04:49.660
Is something wrong?

04:49.740 --> 04:53.300
No, I've been feeling strange
for the last couple of days.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.220
You've got to relax.

05:00.340 --> 05:01.820
Come on,

05:01.900 --> 05:04.820
this is what
you worked so hard for.

05:04.900 --> 05:07.940
You got Howard to invest.

05:08.020 --> 05:11.700
I know,
but you're the genius.

05:11.780 --> 05:13.660
Everything you touch...

05:14.700 --> 05:16.460
turns to gold.

05:18.780 --> 05:20.420
What made you say that?

05:21.860 --> 05:23.500
Come on,

05:23.580 --> 05:26.140
you really don't know
how to have fun, do you?

05:42.940 --> 05:46.140
Don't you feel like
everything's changed all at once?

05:46.180 --> 05:48.500
Of course, it's changed.

05:48.580 --> 05:51.180
We're fucking rich!

05:51.260 --> 05:53.340
Could we just enjoy it?
Come on.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.740
Yeah.

05:58.380 --> 06:01.140
I don't find
any of this enjoyable.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.500
Okay.

06:07.020 --> 06:08.700
No...

06:08.780 --> 06:11.340
Barbara, not that.

06:11.420 --> 06:13.500
That was great
what you were doing there.

06:13.580 --> 06:15.740
- It's not that.
- Okay.

06:15.780 --> 06:17.500
- I didn't mean that.
- Don't do this, okay?

06:17.580 --> 06:19.260
Please.

06:20.740 --> 06:22.060
Sorry.

06:24.180 --> 06:25.820
So now you have to smoke?

06:26.860 --> 06:29.820
It's Howard's boat.
He doesn't mind.

06:29.860 --> 06:32.340
"It's Howard's boat.
He doesn't mind. "

06:32.420 --> 06:33.300
Fine.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.180
Wait. Paul.

06:38.860 --> 06:41.540
Can't you leave that thing
alone for five minutes?

06:41.620 --> 06:42.620
Please?

06:42.700 --> 06:46.020
Our stocks could be going underwater,
and we wouldn't know it.

06:46.060 --> 06:47.980
I'm not worried about that.

06:48.060 --> 06:52.540
There are two possibilities. The share
price stabilizes, and we're fine.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.260
Or it keeps going down,
and there are two possibilities.

06:55.340 --> 07:00.940
We are in a boat
off the coast of Espana. Please.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.740
Espana.
Mother country, right?

07:03.780 --> 07:05.820
My mother wouldn't let me
learn Spanish.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.020
Ran away to the States
first chance she got.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.700
Well, now you're here.

07:10.780 --> 07:12.580
- Full circle.
- Uh-huh.

07:12.660 --> 07:16.620
It's destiny.
You can't program life.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.460
Why not?

07:18.540 --> 07:20.420
- It's a binary system.
- Aw...

07:20.500 --> 07:23.020
Come on. Man, woman...

07:23.100 --> 07:24.660
rich, poor...

07:24.740 --> 07:27.420
- life, death...
- Paul?

07:27.460 --> 07:29.980
I like that.
- Grow up, okay?

07:31.020 --> 07:33.140
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.540
I'm just going on vacation.

07:36.620 --> 07:37.700
Barbara.

07:43.780 --> 07:45.180
Honey...

07:47.500 --> 07:50.780
be careful
with the company files.

07:50.820 --> 07:52.260
Vicki, sorry.

08:00.060 --> 08:01.220
There.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.340
Now the stock is underwater.

08:03.420 --> 08:06.100
What did you do?!
Have you gone nuts?

08:06.180 --> 08:08.380
- You're fucking crazy?
- Wake up, Paul!

08:08.460 --> 08:11.020
Look around! It's beautiful.

08:11.100 --> 08:15.980
- There will be a beautiful sunset.
- There will be a beautiful sunset.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.820
That's great!
That makes everything all right.

08:18.860 --> 08:21.900
There's only one thing.
Now I only have those files on disk.

08:21.980 --> 08:24.220
I'm not backed up,
all right?

08:24.300 --> 08:28.220
You're so backed up that's your ass
coming over the horizon.

08:28.260 --> 08:30.180
Would you mind moving?

08:30.220 --> 08:33.340
There's only a little sun left
and you're standing in it.

08:33.419 --> 08:35.980
Remember when we used
to fight like that, darling?

08:36.059 --> 08:38.700
Except I would have
thrown you overboard.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.860
Would have been cheaper.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.059
Hey...

08:44.100 --> 08:45.820
do you hear that?

08:48.340 --> 08:50.340
It's coming from that village.

08:50.420 --> 08:52.260
Probably some sort
of religious festival.

08:53.580 --> 08:56.660
That's all we need.
Singing nuns.

08:58.300 --> 09:01.180
I'm going to freshen up.
Excuse me.

09:01.260 --> 09:02.980
Excuse me.

09:05.140 --> 09:07.460
I don't like the look of those.

09:09.420 --> 09:11.060
Yep.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.780
I'd say
we've got a storm coming.

09:14.860 --> 09:18.060
All right, let's move
everything below deck...

09:18.140 --> 09:19.980
or tie it down.

09:32.860 --> 09:35.220
That thing's
coming right at us.

09:36.260 --> 09:38.540
I'll take us
away from the reef.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.820
- Up anchor.
- Yeah, sure.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.340
- Where is it?
- I've got it.

09:54.460 --> 09:58.020
- You're not looking too well.
- I'll be okay.

10:03.140 --> 10:04.900
Aw, shit!

10:21.900 --> 10:24.900
- Hey, look out!
- Brace yourselves!

10:28.860 --> 10:29.860
Jesus!

10:38.500 --> 10:40.140
Aaaah!

10:43.660 --> 10:45.780
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah.

10:45.860 --> 10:47.500
- I think so.
- You sure?

10:47.580 --> 10:49.340
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:49.380 --> 10:52.300
Vicki?

10:59.700 --> 11:01.660
Okay, baby.

11:04.140 --> 11:06.380
Paul, give me a hand here.

11:10.780 --> 11:12.740
It's okay, Vicki.

11:12.820 --> 11:14.460
I'll radio for help.

11:18.020 --> 11:21.020
- Can you move your leg at all?
- No, I can't.

11:21.060 --> 11:22.900
- I can't.
- The radio's out.

11:22.980 --> 11:24.740
And the computer-

11:24.820 --> 11:28.260
Okay. Take this and
go signal to the shore.

11:28.340 --> 11:29.740
- Hurry!
- What?

11:29.820 --> 11:32.300
Don't worry,
we'll get you out of here.

11:53.340 --> 11:54.740
All right, okay.

12:00.260 --> 12:01.940
Come on!

12:07.620 --> 12:09.660
Where the hell is everybody?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.500
Damn it!

12:20.060 --> 12:23.580
We'll have to take the raft
into that town for help.

12:23.620 --> 12:25.420
Okay...

12:25.500 --> 12:27.540
you go with Paul.
I'll stay with Vicki.

12:27.620 --> 12:29.380
- It's my boat.
- Howard, please.

12:29.460 --> 12:31.420
I'm staying here.

12:33.540 --> 12:36.820
- Okay, hold this.
- I got it.

12:36.900 --> 12:40.660
- I'll be back soon, okay?
- Please, please...

12:40.740 --> 12:42.460
Oh God.

12:43.940 --> 12:45.620
It'll be okay.

12:45.700 --> 12:47.940
Hang in there, okay?

12:59.860 --> 13:03.700
- You think she'll be okay?
- Not if this crate sinks.

13:05.380 --> 13:06.940
Howard...

13:08.460 --> 13:10.540
are we going to die?

13:11.820 --> 13:13.980
No, not us.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.220
We're survivors.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.500
Rescue at sea,
hey, darling.

13:44.220 --> 13:46.180
Okay. All right.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.100
We've got
to get to shore fast.

13:48.180 --> 13:51.740
They won't have a chance
if the storm gets worse.

13:57.220 --> 13:59.020
What the hell was that?

13:59.100 --> 14:01.020
We must have hit a rock.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.980
That's one possibility.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.340
We've sprung a leak.
Anything to bail with?

14:11.420 --> 14:13.580
No, we have
to make it to the dock.

14:21.060 --> 14:23.100
There's something
in the water.

14:23.180 --> 14:24.380
What?

14:25.380 --> 14:28.020
I don't know.
I felt something.

14:43.740 --> 14:45.660
I can't see anything.

15:04.740 --> 15:06.620
What are they shooting at?

15:06.660 --> 15:09.180
Please don't
let it be sharks.

15:10.700 --> 15:11.620
Okay...

15:12.860 --> 15:15.100
- we've got to go back.
- Are you crazy?

15:15.140 --> 15:18.180
We can't even
make it to the dock!

15:18.260 --> 15:19.260
Well...

15:21.220 --> 15:22.940
Come on!

15:23.020 --> 15:23.940
I can't.

15:23.980 --> 15:26.220
- Dump the motor.
- What?!

15:26.300 --> 15:27.580
Dump it.

15:28.820 --> 15:30.580
Come on.

15:34.180 --> 15:35.900
Use this.

15:39.140 --> 15:40.740
Come on.

15:41.020 --> 15:43.420
We've got
to put in the thing.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.540
- Come on.
- What do you do with it?

16:19.780 --> 16:22.380
Where the hell is everybody?

16:22.460 --> 16:24.380
Oh great.

16:52.580 --> 16:54.300
This way.

17:02.020 --> 17:03.300
No, wait.

17:03.380 --> 17:05.220
The singing.

17:06.660 --> 17:08.579
It's coming from the church.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.620
Hello?

18:00.700 --> 18:02.740
We need help.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.180
Ayuda, por favor.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.540
What the hell's
going on here?

18:15.980 --> 18:17.980
What kind of church is this?

18:20.340 --> 18:22.180
Si?

18:22.220 --> 18:25.620
- We need the police.
- La policia, por favor.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.620
- And a doctor.
- Y un doctor.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.660
Nuestro barco choco.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.420
Nuestros amigos estan heridos.

18:31.500 --> 18:34.620
- Donde? Lleveme ahi.
- Come on.

18:37.940 --> 18:40.500
It's right there. There!

18:41.540 --> 18:43.740
Tenemos que llegar alli.

18:43.780 --> 18:45.700
Imposible. La tormenta.

18:45.780 --> 18:48.060
Pero hay gente alli
en el barco.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.780
Hey, you guys!

18:50.820 --> 18:52.620
Can they help us?

18:56.620 --> 19:00.500
Levade o home o barco.
Xa me quedo eu coa muller.

19:02.860 --> 19:04.980
Los llevaran al barco.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.820
- He says they'll take us.
- Let's go.

19:07.900 --> 19:10.900
Alguno de ustedes podria quedarse
para informar a la policia?

19:12.220 --> 19:15.260
- What now?
- He says someone has to stay here

19:15.340 --> 19:17.620
- to inform the police.
- La senorita podria quedarse.

19:20.140 --> 19:21.740
All right.

19:21.820 --> 19:23.700
- You stay.
- No.

19:23.780 --> 19:26.140
- You hate boats. I'll go.
- No.

19:26.180 --> 19:28.260
I'll be fine.

19:28.340 --> 19:32.060
It's just... I don't want
to leave you with this guy.

19:32.100 --> 19:35.380
- He gives me the creeps.
- I'll help the senorita

19:35.460 --> 19:37.780
to find the police,
and the doctor.

19:38.820 --> 19:42.100
Fine. Listen...

19:42.180 --> 19:44.060
be careful, yeah?

19:44.100 --> 19:45.180
Okay.

19:46.340 --> 19:48.060
Two possibilities.

19:52.420 --> 19:54.100
Okay.

20:42.140 --> 20:43.780
No funciona?

20:43.860 --> 20:45.820
Hay un telefono en el hotel.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.380
El hotel?

20:47.460 --> 20:49.780
Si, el Hotel del Mar.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.900
Usted avise a la policia.
Yo traere al medico.

20:56.940 --> 20:59.140
- Gracias.
- De nada.

22:16.260 --> 22:18.620
Necesito un telefono,
por favor.

22:18.700 --> 22:20.580
Es una emergencia.

22:24.740 --> 22:27.420
El padre dijo que podria utilizar
su telefono

22:27.460 --> 22:30.380
para llamar
a la policia. Si?

22:36.780 --> 22:40.100
Podria utilizar su telefono,
por favor?

22:44.780 --> 22:46.900
Let go! Hey!

22:50.020 --> 22:52.780
Ay! Padre, me ataco!

22:53.980 --> 22:55.740
Padre! Padre!

23:12.260 --> 23:15.500
All right.
Bring us alongside.

23:26.140 --> 23:28.500
Howard, Vicki, I'm back.

23:29.700 --> 23:30.700
Howard?

23:32.980 --> 23:34.620
Vicki?

23:46.420 --> 23:48.020
Howard?

24:07.900 --> 24:09.740
Your friends?

24:13.620 --> 24:16.300
La senorita goes
to find the police.

24:17.700 --> 24:18.820
Where?

24:18.900 --> 24:21.940
In Santiago. 50 kilometers.

24:22.020 --> 24:24.700
No police in Imboca.

24:24.740 --> 24:27.900
She says to go to hotel.

24:27.980 --> 24:30.580
She come one hour.

24:30.660 --> 24:32.500
What hotel?

24:55.740 --> 24:58.020
I'm supposed
to meet someone here.

24:59.140 --> 25:00.740
A woman.

25:02.260 --> 25:03.940
Senorita.

25:05.780 --> 25:06.860
No?

25:18.020 --> 25:19.500
Senorita?

25:39.100 --> 25:41.500
Just give me a room
till she gets back.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.980
Roomo...

25:50.020 --> 25:51.660
pleaso?

25:54.460 --> 25:56.700
Room, por favor.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.140
Muchos dias.

26:18.940 --> 26:21.860
Uh... it's upstairs?
The room?

26:24.260 --> 26:25.820

26:27.420 --> 26:29.020

26:42.220 --> 26:43.940
Esta eiqui.

26:44.020 --> 26:46.140

28:41.780 --> 28:43.500

29:18.700 --> 29:20.820

29:26.540 --> 29:28.340
What the fuck?!

30:25.860 --> 30:27.460

30:41.900 --> 30:43.500

31:50.660 --> 31:52.220

Oh shit!

32:44.340 --> 32:45.380

32:54.340 --> 32:56.060
Can I help you?

32:58.980 --> 33:00.700
Oh, fuck!

35:04.420 --> 35:06.700
Oh no.

36:16.060 --> 36:18.620
Oh my God! Howard!

36:45.820 --> 36:47.180
Stay away.

37:46.500 --> 37:50.180
Axuda! Axuda! Axuda!

37:50.260 --> 37:51.580
Shut up!

37:54.900 --> 37:58.140
What's the matter with you people?
Why are you doing this?

38:32.500 --> 38:35.220
You're going to help me.

38:35.300 --> 38:38.940
And you won't make a sound.
Silencio, understand?

38:40.220 --> 38:42.260
Understand? Huh?

38:42.340 --> 38:45.340
Okay. No hurt.

38:53.140 --> 38:57.940
- Why did they kill my friends?
- They take his face.

38:58.020 --> 39:00.900
They kill you.
Take your face.

39:04.180 --> 39:07.220
There was a woman
on the boat.

39:08.580 --> 39:09.980
She dead.

39:10.980 --> 39:12.860
Two women dead.

39:13.860 --> 39:16.060
Two women?

39:16.100 --> 39:18.820
Si. One from the boat,

39:18.900 --> 39:21.380
one comes with you
to la iglesia.

39:22.980 --> 39:25.340
The woman who came with me
to the church, she's dead?

39:25.420 --> 39:26.980
Si.

39:27.060 --> 39:28.900
They kill.

39:28.980 --> 39:33.300
- How do you know? Are you sure?
- I see them kill.

39:34.660 --> 39:36.140
The women...

39:38.060 --> 39:39.260
they die.

39:50.820 --> 39:52.980
No one leave Imboca.

39:54.020 --> 39:55.820
People come...

39:57.460 --> 39:59.380
no one leave.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.780
Why? What-

40:03.820 --> 40:05.780
why try to kill us?
What did we do?

40:12.020 --> 40:14.900
You think Ezequiel is loco.

40:17.220 --> 40:19.580
But I tell you true.

40:20.580 --> 40:23.460
I tell you secret.

40:23.500 --> 40:26.380
Secret of Imboca.

40:26.460 --> 40:28.460
Long before...

40:29.500 --> 40:32.540
Imboca no like now.

40:32.620 --> 40:35.780
Imboca pueblo de Cristo.

40:35.860 --> 40:38.260
Town of God.

40:47.180 --> 40:48.980
I am boy...

40:53.860 --> 40:56.540
son of fisherman.

41:08.260 --> 41:11.100
But no fish in ocean.

41:13.220 --> 41:15.140
So, we pray.

41:20.740 --> 41:24.260
But God, he no answer.

41:30.580 --> 41:33.660
Then come... Capitan Combarro.

41:34.780 --> 41:38.660
He say in great Pacific Ocean,

41:38.740 --> 41:40.660
discover gold.

41:45.100 --> 41:48.460
He say people fools.

41:48.540 --> 41:52.500
Pray to God
who no answer prayer.

41:52.580 --> 41:57.980
He say he know God
who bring fish...

41:58.060 --> 41:59.460
and more.

41:59.540 --> 42:02.140
Priest say no,

42:02.180 --> 42:04.540
but capitan say...

42:04.620 --> 42:09.100
he bring great God
to Imboca.

42:38.980 --> 42:41.540
I hear first time...

42:41.620 --> 42:44.180
new prayer.

42:44.260 --> 42:47.140
"la! la!

42:47.220 --> 42:49.460
Cthulhu fhtagn!"

42:51.620 --> 42:54.700
I wish I never hear.

43:13.860 --> 43:17.340
I wish I never see.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.980
Soon, Imboca rich.

43:29.060 --> 43:31.140
There is much fish,

43:31.220 --> 43:33.420
and much gold.

43:34.620 --> 43:37.380
Gold from the sea.

44:08.100 --> 44:11.420
People go against God.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.300
No worship Cristo.

44:25.580 --> 44:28.660
All worship Dagon.

44:29.860 --> 44:32.220
Or die.

44:48.420 --> 44:51.700
All Imboca pray to Dagon.

44:56.300 --> 44:59.820
But one day, no more gold.

45:02.380 --> 45:05.500
Dagon want sacrifice.

45:45.900 --> 45:48.860
All worship Dagon...

45:48.940 --> 45:50.940
or die.

46:07.660 --> 46:10.020
Two possibilities.

46:11.300 --> 46:13.020
Either you're drunk...

46:14.660 --> 46:16.460
or you're totally
fucking insane!

46:20.300 --> 46:23.740
What did you do that for?
What are you doing?

46:23.820 --> 46:25.340
Drink, si.

46:25.420 --> 46:27.420
Loco, si.

46:27.500 --> 46:29.820
But I tell you true.

46:29.900 --> 46:32.060
Ezequiel no lie.

46:33.140 --> 46:35.660
I am last man in Imboca.

46:35.740 --> 46:36.860
Oh yeah?

46:36.940 --> 46:39.340
Yeah?
Why didn't they kill you?

46:40.820 --> 46:42.180
I drink.

46:43.500 --> 46:45.140
I loco.

46:46.300 --> 46:48.060
You? Loco?

46:48.100 --> 46:49.780
No, really?

46:52.220 --> 46:54.980
I've got to get out of here.

46:58.380 --> 47:00.060
I need a car.

47:01.300 --> 47:03.860
No coche in Imboca.

47:06.300 --> 47:08.500
I saw a car,

47:08.580 --> 47:11.420
a big black car.

47:20.180 --> 47:23.060
Only coche in Imboca,

47:23.140 --> 47:25.620
but you won't get,

47:25.660 --> 47:29.100
belong to Xavier Combarro,

47:29.180 --> 47:32.020
grandson
to capitan Combarro.

47:40.340 --> 47:42.220
That's Xavier.

47:46.460 --> 47:49.020
What the hell's wrong
with him?

47:51.260 --> 47:54.260
What's wrong with everybody
in this town?

47:54.340 --> 47:56.100
They are changing.

47:56.180 --> 48:00.620
- Changing to go into sea.
- Into what- the sea?

48:00.700 --> 48:02.860
Some cannot walk anymore.

48:05.420 --> 48:08.340
Xavier can go into sea,

48:08.420 --> 48:11.060
but he stay in Imboca.

48:11.140 --> 48:13.060
Bastardo!

48:17.500 --> 48:18.820
Oh great.

48:18.900 --> 48:22.300
- What am I going to do with you?
- No kill! No kill!

48:22.380 --> 48:26.340
- I am man, like you.
- There are two possibilities.

48:26.420 --> 48:28.500
- I kill you-
- I no tell.

48:28.580 --> 48:31.380
- I no tell nobody.
- Or I could trust you.

48:31.460 --> 48:34.380
Okay? And then
there are two possibilities.

48:34.460 --> 48:37.020
But I don't have time to-

48:39.380 --> 48:41.100
Oh fuck!

48:41.180 --> 48:43.260
Where are you going?

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.820
Paul.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.300
Hey.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.860
It's me, Barbara.

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.220
Barbara? Barbara?

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:29.140
Barbara.

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.060
Hey,

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.060
that's my lighter.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:51.500
Yeah. It saved my life.

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.140
If we get out of this,

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:54.660
you can smoke all you want.

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.300
He told me you were dead.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:04.620
Who?

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:07.100
I tell him, senora.

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.660
Ezequiel!

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.340
Si.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.620
I am like you, now.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.780
A prisoner.

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.820
You said
you saw them killed.

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:25.060
Worse than kill.

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:27.540
What's that?

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.500
Come.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:42.020
She was already here
when they locked me up.

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:48.460
It's Barbara.

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.020
Vicki?

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.300
It's okay. I'm here.

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:08.220
What happened?

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.020
Howard's... dead.

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.900
- I know.
- They took him under.

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:19.300
He couldn't breathe.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.140
It crushed his head.

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.140
But you're alive.

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:27.020
You're still alive.

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.700
- Try not to think about it.
- No.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:32.500
It- oh God.

01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:35.700
- It's inside me.
- They give to Dagon.

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:38.820
- What does that mean?
- He have her.

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.700
Take her.

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:43.420
Se la ha follado.

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.300
He fuck her.

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.060
It took me under.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:53.100
I was covered-

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:56.820
It had all these-

01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:59.100
oh God, it-

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:01.700
I was... sick.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:03.620
I couldn't breathe.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.380
Vicki, listen to me.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:09.300
- We'll get out of this.
- My leg!

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:12.540
There was an accident
on the boat.

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.940
They must have...

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:17.980
given you drugs
for the pain

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.260
and made you hallucinate.
It was a dream.

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:22.460
A dream?

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.500
Is no dream.

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.740
We'll get you to a doctor.

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:30.820
Why are they doing this?

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.940
Because you know.

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:37.180
Know what?

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:41.100
Their secret.

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.140
What secret?

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:00.660
Listen...

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.340
if that happens to me...

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.260
you've got to promise...

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.940
you'll kill me.

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:12.780
Listen to me.
We'll get out of this.

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.180
Promise.

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:17.500
Please.

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.260
Seguideme!

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.260
They come.

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:42.100
- They take our skin.
- Don't let them take me!

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:44.980
They pray to that thing!
They're not human!

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:46.780
You've got to be quiet.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.660
Voy por ti, cabron!

01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.420
- Come on, Vicki!
- No.

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.060
Barbara!

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:43.540
Barbara!

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:54.300
Now, you serve Dagon.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.740
No!

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:03.300
No.

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.420
- It's the only way.
- Vicki!

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.140
Goodbye, Paul.

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:10.660
- Vicki!
- Vicki, no!

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:14.060
Vicki! Vicki!

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:18.779
Vicki!

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.899
Vicki!

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.819
Levadeos!

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:39.340
No!

01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.220
Don't let them take me!

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.420
- No!
- Let her go!

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.660
Let her go!

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:47.300
A la teneria, de presa!

01:08:49.819 --> 01:08:51.580
No!

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:08.660
Como pudeste facernos esto?

01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:10.500
Parece mentira.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.180
Dexaronte vivir
e traicionaxesnos.

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.140
You will die here...

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.939
in Imboca.

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:23.340
We will live for eternity
in the sea.

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.220
This is the way of Dagon.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:27.340
Look...

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.740
I can write you a check now
for $1 million.

01:09:30.779 --> 01:09:33.180
$10 million
if you let us go and the woman.

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.580
Okay?

01:09:38.859 --> 01:09:41.779
We have thousand times that
in gold.

01:09:41.859 --> 01:09:44.220
It means nothing.

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:47.819
Great!

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:00.060
Great!

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:12.540
la!

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.140
la!

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:18.580
Cthulhu...

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:21.020
fhtagn!

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:38.300
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.340
If you hadn't helped me, I-

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:41.460
No.

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:44.140
You make me remember...

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:46.260
my father...

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.860
and my mother...

01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:51.180
and who they want me to be.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.180
Muchas gracias, mi amigo.

01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:58.060
I will see your faces again...

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.980
but you will not see mine.

01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:06.260
Si, but we die like men.

01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:10.140
The Lord is mi pastor.

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.060
I no want.

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:16.460
He make me lie down...

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:20.300
- fuentes tranquilas.
- ... In green pastures.

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:23.340
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:26.580
He restoreth my soul.

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:28.260
...me guia por el camino justo,

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.860
por el honor de su nombre.

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:35.500
He leadeth me in the path
of righteousness...

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:38.140
for His name's sake.

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:41.380
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.980
I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:48.380
Thy rod and Thy staff...

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.220
comfort me.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:56.500
Thou shalt prepare a table before
me in the presence of mine enemies.

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.020
My cup runneth over.

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.140
Thy loving kindness
and mercy...

01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:33.020
shall follow me...
all the days of my life.

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:38.420
And I shall dwell...

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:40.100
in the house of the Lord...

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.060
forever.

01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:04.700
Do it.

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.820
Do it!

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.340
No! Quitalle as mans de arriba!

01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:15.060
Non lle manques!

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.540
El sacrificio debe continuar.

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:18.260
Osas decirme
lo que debo hacer?

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:19.860
Vete!

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:21.620
Tengo que hablar con el.

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:33.220
You will live
because you are mine.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:36.180
You want to tell me
why this is happening?

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:38.380
You will understand
everything soon.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.500
But you must stay with me.

01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:44.740
If I stay,
will you let Barbara go?

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:51.900
Until you came, there had been
no sacrifices for a year.

01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:54.420
- Dagon needs her.
- Fuck Dagon!

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:56.380
Yes.

01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:59.100
And their child
will be immortal.

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.580
But there's a catch!

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:05.900
It has to live the rest of its life
as some half-assed fish in the sea!

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:08.180
In joy, with Dagon.

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:10.540
I'll do whatever you want.

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.740
Please... let her go.

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:17.780
You cannot care for her.

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.540
You do not dream of her.

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:26.540
We will go soon
to a beautiful place.

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:28.820
You'll forget your world...

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:30.820
and your friends.

01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:33.820
There will be no time,

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:35.260
no end,

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:37.820
no today, no yesterday,

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:39.700
no tomorrow...

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:42.220
only the forever,

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:44.260
and forever,

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:47.180
and forever, without end.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:54.180
I don't have a choice, do I?

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:56.060
No.

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:59.540
It is your fate,
your destiny.

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.860
I still have human feelings.

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:18.660
Imbocanos, escuchademe.

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:21.060
Paul quedara en liberdade.

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:23.220
Traedeo a ceremonia.

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:40.500
Levate a ese cabron.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.060
The priestess Uxia
chooses you...

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:50.140
a man.

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:09.140
Come on, motherfucker!

01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:12.220
I'm not a defenseless old man.
You want this face?

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.420
This is what
it's like to die!

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.980
You motherfuckers!

01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.860
Two possibilities.

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:01.340
Right.

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:08.500
Stop!

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:10.620
It's enough!

01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:12.900
Para! Para!

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:19.260
Goddamnit!

01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:22.300
Damn you!

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.820
Te voy a matar,
hija de puta.

01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:38.940
la! la! Cthulhu fhtagn!

01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:49.020
No! No!

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:52.340
No! No!

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:53.900
la! la!

01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:56.860
No!

01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:00.540
Leave me alone!

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:04.660
Por favor.

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:09.060
Dagon!

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:10.540
la! la!

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.500
You'll rot in hell!

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:23.940
You'll burn
for fucking eternity!

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:27.220
We will live for eternity,

01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:29.140
and so will your child.

01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:35.540
Dagon!

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:36.660
la! la!

01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:02.780
No!

01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:50.420
Pablo!

01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:29.180
Barbara!

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:21.380
Barbara!

01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:25.220
I got you. I got you.

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:26.580
Okay.

01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.420
Kill me.

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.060
You promised.

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:37.300
No. I'll get you out.

01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:38.940
I'll get you out.

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:48.420
Barbara!

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:50.380
No!

01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:28.180
Parad!

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:01.260
- Pablo.
- Si, pai, si.

01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:06.300
I look for you.

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:09.940
I dream, pero nada.

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:12.660
What-

01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:16.900
You Combarro.

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:22.180
- I'm Paul Marsh.
- No.

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:24.540
Your mother married Xavier.

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.580
She steal you.

01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:29.260
Once, he was young,

01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:31.100
and rich...

01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:33.980
and handsome for a man.

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:39.260
He brought women to Imboca.

01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:42.100
Outsiders...

01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:46.700
- your mother.
- No!

01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:53.020
I think
I never see you again.

01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:58.460
Imbocanos...

01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:02.100
Es Pablo.

01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:05.900
Pablo Combarro ha vuelto.

01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:11.980
Ten o sinais.

01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:26.420
You...

01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:29.060
are my son.

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.140
You're fucking insane!

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:37.060
Pablo.

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.580
It is your destiny.

01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:42.700
You stay away!
I'll kill you all!

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:44.740
I'll burn this town
to the ground!

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:47.460
We had different mothers,

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:50.020
but the same father.

01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:52.420
We are children of Dagon.

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:56.220
You're a bunch
of fucking freaks!

01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:58.660
Your dreams...

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:01.820
remember your dreams,
Pablo.

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:04.020
They brought you here.

01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.900
They were nightmares.
They weren't real.

01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:10.580
Every dream is a wish.

01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:21.180
Somebody help me.

01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:23.220
What's happening to me?

01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:25.420
You are my brother.

01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:29.020
You will be my lover...

01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:31.420
forever.

01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:02.300
No possibilities.

01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:08.340
Pablo! No!

01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:13.380
No!
