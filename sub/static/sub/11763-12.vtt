WEBVTT

00:02.473 --> 00:04.375
I LOVE YOU.

00:04.375 --> 00:06.577
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

00:06.577 --> 00:09.040
I'M FEELING GOOD
ABOUT JAYSON--

00:09.040 --> 00:11.042
THAT IS HALF JULES
AND HALF GRAYSON.

00:11.042 --> 00:13.184
SEE, I COMBINED OUR NAMES
THE WAY THEY DO

00:13.184 --> 00:15.386
WITH THE CELEBRITY COUPLES.
"JAYSON" SUCKS.

00:15.386 --> 00:18.519
IT'S A REAL NAME.
WHAT ABOUT, UM, "GRULES"?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.521
IT SOUNDS LIKE
SOMETHING ORPHANS EAT.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.693
(imitates British accent)
"PLEASE, SIR,

00:22.693 --> 00:26.157
MAY I HAVE SOME GRULES?"
(imitates British accent) NO!
YOU GET BACK IN YOUR SPACESHIP!

00:26.157 --> 00:29.460
(normal voice) WHAT?
(normal voice)
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DOING.

00:29.460 --> 00:32.333
HEY, DO YOU THINK A YEAR FROM
NOW WE'LL BE LIVING TOGETHER?

00:32.333 --> 00:34.665
BYE-BYE, NICE MOMENT.

00:34.665 --> 00:38.069
I'M SORRY. I-I ALWAYS FIXATE
ON THE NEXT. I'M FUTURE GAL.

00:38.069 --> 00:41.172
WELL, I'M NOW GUY.
OH, NO. WE'RE MORTAL ENEMIES.

00:41.172 --> 00:43.174
JUST THAT RIGHT NOW
IS SO AWESOME,

00:43.174 --> 00:45.476
WHY WOULDN'T I WANT
TO BE IN THE MOMENT?

00:45.476 --> 00:47.478
YOU'RE RIGHT.
FROM NOW ON, I'M DOING THAT.

00:47.478 --> 00:51.282
FUTURE GAL IS SO ANNOYING.
SHE'S NOT AS BAD
AS "WHAT IF?" GUY.

00:51.282 --> 00:53.624
WHAT IF WHEN WE MET,
I WAS A BILLIONAIRE?

00:53.624 --> 00:56.157
YOU THINK WE STILL
WOULD'VE ENDED UP TOGETHER?

00:56.157 --> 00:59.460
I DON'T KNOW. I DEFINITELY WOULD
HAVE HAD SEX WITH YOU SOONER.
AW, SWEET.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.831
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

01:00.831 --> 01:04.064
MMM. JULES' HOUSE
DOESN'T OPEN UP UNTIL 8:00.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.696
YOU'RE OUT OF MILK.

01:05.696 --> 01:08.399
OH, THAT'S PARTY MIX, BUDDY.
THAT'S WHY IT TASTES SALTY.

01:08.399 --> 01:10.541
NOW THAT JULES AND GRAYSON
ARE IN LOVE,

01:10.541 --> 01:13.144
DO YOU EVER WORRY
THAT TRAVIS IS

01:13.144 --> 01:15.776
GONNA SEE GRAYSON
AS A FATHER FIGURE?

01:15.776 --> 01:19.450
(mouth full) NOPE. BUT NOW
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE.

01:21.852 --> 01:24.355
YOU WERE--
YOU WERE TOO MEAN TO BOBBY.

01:24.355 --> 01:26.086
OH, THAT'S WOMEN, BUDDY.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.290
GUY FRIENDS WOULDN'T DO THAT.
MNH-MNH. WE'RE TOO LOYAL.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.292
I'M GETTING ARM?
I'M MAKING A POINT.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.723
(chuckles) WARM.

01:32.723 --> 01:35.866
SO WHAT IF YOU'RE LOYAL?
IT'S LOYALTY BASED ON NOTHING--

01:35.866 --> 01:40.100
SPORTS, BEER, "OH, LET'S PEE
ON THIS THING AND THEN WRESTLE."

01:40.100 --> 01:42.102
(chuckles) YOU'RE LIKE DOGS.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.406
AT LEAST WE DON'T DUMP FRIENDS
AT THE DROP OF A HAT.
I ACTUALLY DID

01:45.406 --> 01:48.379
DUMP A FRIEND FOR DROPPING
MY FAVORITE HAT IN A PUDDLE.

01:48.379 --> 01:51.111
HAVE A NICE LIFE, NEZZIE.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.544
INEVER DROP FRIENDS.

01:53.544 --> 01:54.845
OH, REALLY?
(beeping)

01:54.845 --> 01:58.389
POW! WEDDING PICTURE OF YOU
AND YOUR BRIDESMAIDS.

01:58.389 --> 02:01.452
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JULES, YOU
NO LONGER SPEAK TO ANY OF THEM.

02:01.452 --> 02:03.154
NO WAY!
YEAH.

02:03.154 --> 02:04.495
SHE HAS VALID REASONS.

02:04.495 --> 02:07.198
I MEAN, KATIE HAD HER BABY
IN A BATHTUB.

02:07.198 --> 02:08.499
UNACCEPTABLE.

02:08.499 --> 02:10.401
AND, WELL, TINA DOESN'T COUNT.

02:10.401 --> 02:13.504
SHE BACKS UP MEDIOCRE LOOKS
WITH A HORRIBLE PERSONALITY.

02:13.504 --> 02:14.865
TINA'S MY BABY SISTER.

02:14.865 --> 02:17.538
IF YOU WANNA SEE A PICTURE
THAT MATTERS...

02:17.538 --> 02:19.240
CHECK IT OUT.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.842
FRIENDS... FOR... LIFE.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.775
I WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR THE WOMEN IN THIS PICTURE.

02:24.775 --> 02:28.179
ANYTHING.
HEY, MY APARTMENT IS GETTING
PAINTED THIS WEEKEND.

02:28.179 --> 02:30.181
CAN I CRASH HERE?

02:30.181 --> 02:32.853
WOW. THAT IS, LIKE, THE PERFECT
TIME TO ASK ME THAT.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.855
BRAVO. BRAVO.
WELL DONE. REALLY.

02:34.855 --> 02:38.229
THANK YOU.
DON'T YOU THINK THAT PICTURE
WOULD LOOK BETTER LIKE THIS?

02:38.229 --> 02:41.762
REALLY? LET'S CUT OUT
OLDIE McPHEE.
OH, LOOK AT THIS ONE.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.764
STOP IT. GUYS, FIRST OF ALL,
IMMATURE AND...

02:43.764 --> 02:46.767
BEFORE I MET YOU, I WAS DATING
A RICH 30-YEAR-OLD GUY--

02:46.767 --> 02:50.301
LOVING THIS STORY SO FAR.
CALM DOWN. HE WAS A BIG UGGO.

02:50.301 --> 02:53.874
REALLY?
NO, HE WAS BEAUTIFUL.
ONE WEEKEND HE TOOK ME TO PARIS,

02:53.874 --> 02:56.877
AND WE STROLLED ALONG
THE SEINE--
STROLLING ALONG RIVERS
IN PARIS? (chuckles)

02:56.877 --> 02:58.879
IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE...

02:58.879 --> 03:02.213
(high-pitched voice)
"HELP! I'M TRAPPED IN A CLICHГ©!"
TRAV, OUR LAST DATE WAS

03:02.213 --> 03:04.485
WATCHING THE FIRST SEASON DVD
OF "COMMUNITY"

03:04.485 --> 03:06.617
AND STAYING UP ALL NIGHT

03:06.617 --> 03:09.720
WATCHING
NINEEMILIO ESTEVEZ MOVIES.
THE ESTEVEZ-FESTEVEZ.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.893
LOOK, YOU COULD STAND TO BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE ROMANTIC.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.926
I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU,
SO DON'T FREAK OUT, OKAY?

03:15.926 --> 03:17.968
PLEASE, WOMAN. (scoffs)

03:17.968 --> 03:19.930
I'M TOTALLY ESTEVEZ.

03:19.930 --> 03:22.803
GUYS! GUYS, GUYS, GUYS. HI.

03:22.803 --> 03:26.407
CAN I ASK YOU
A RELATIONSHIP QUESTION?
NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE YOU
AS MUCH AS I DO.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.409
YEAH,
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING HIM.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.241
SURE. BYE, SWEETIE.
BYE.

03:30.241 --> 03:32.443
OH, LOOK.
THAT NEW WINE BAR OPENED.

03:32.443 --> 03:35.215
THAT PLACE IS MY COMPETITION.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.488
YOU THOUGHT GIRLS WEREN'T LOYAL,
BUT WE LOVE WINE,

03:37.488 --> 03:39.950
AND WE HAVEN'T STEPPED FOOT
IN THAT PLACE.

03:39.950 --> 03:42.293
THAT'S REAL FRIENDSHIP, PAL.
(lowered voice) WINE BAR?

03:42.293 --> 03:43.954
ELLIE'S ALREADY
RUNNING THERE. GO!

03:43.954 --> 03:46.397
WINE BAR!

03:46.397 --> 03:48.399
NOW, LADIES, WHAT I ADORE

03:48.399 --> 03:50.631
ABOUT THIS PINOT IS
ITS AUDACITY.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.763
UM...
I'LL TELL YOU LATER.

03:52.763 --> 03:55.736
(whispers) OKAY.
YOU'LL DETECT SUBTLE HINTS
OF JUNIPER BERRY--

03:55.736 --> 03:59.440
BUDDY, IF IT TAKES THE EDGE OFF,
I AM GOOD TO GO.
AND YOU'RE DONE.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.344
WAIT. WHAT?
YOU DON'T DRINK WINE
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

04:03.344 --> 04:06.617
SHE DOESN'T.
THIS IS
THE MOST HORRIBLE DAY EVER.

04:06.617 --> 04:08.619
BLONDE ONE, TRY THAT.
(glass slides)

04:08.619 --> 04:10.651
TELL ME WHAT YOU TASTE.

04:13.384 --> 04:15.556
CINNAMON.
EXACTLY.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.028
SHE IS CHEWING CINNAMON GUM.

04:18.028 --> 04:19.730
(scoffs) NO.

04:21.031 --> 04:24.995
ROMANCE ISN'T ALL ABOUT
SUNSETS AND FLOWERS.

04:24.995 --> 04:27.998
IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS GETTING
TO A POINT WITH YOUR WOMAN

04:27.998 --> 04:30.000
WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY
STAND TO LISTEN

04:30.000 --> 04:32.042
TO ALL
HER POINTLESS JIBBERJABBER.

04:32.042 --> 04:35.045
I HOPE YOU AND MY MOM
GROW OLD TOGETHER.

04:35.045 --> 04:40.381
WHAT YOU LADIES GABBING ABOUT?
JUST GETTING SOME TERRIBLE
ADVICE ON GIRLFRIEND ISSUES.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.913
SO YOU WENT TOHIM
WITH YOUR PROBLEM?

04:42.913 --> 04:44.915
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT, TRAVIS?

04:44.915 --> 04:46.987
ANDY,
NOT SURE WHYYOU'REUPSET.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.920
BECAUSE I'M HUMAN.

04:49.920 --> 04:53.023
SCOOT OVER.
I WANT IN ON THIS.

04:53.023 --> 04:54.525
ROMANCE, HUH?

04:54.525 --> 04:57.498
AH! WHATIF
YOU ONLY HAD ONE NIGHT

04:57.498 --> 04:59.630
WITH KIRSTEN
BEFORE SHE EXPLODED?

05:01.732 --> 05:03.934
YOU HATE "WHAT IF?" GUY,
DON'T YOU?
MM-HMM.

05:03.934 --> 05:07.307
CAN'T STAND HIM.
SO MUCH.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.080
WHAT IFYOU DIDN'T?
(laughs)

05:10.080 --> 05:13.644
WE AGREE TO NEVER GO BACK TO
THAT JERK'S WINE PLACE AGAIN?

05:13.644 --> 05:16.887
OUR 2-PERSON BOYCOTT
WILL BRING HIM TO HIS KNEES.

05:16.887 --> 05:19.089
WHY ARE
YOU PUTTING THINGS AWAY?

05:19.089 --> 05:22.923
GETTING READY FOR LAURIE
TO COME OVER.
OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE
LAURIE-PROOFING YOUR HOUSE.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.426
SHE GETS INTO THINGS.
LIKE A RACCOON.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.428
KIND OF, BUT ONLY BECAUSE
RACCOONS ARE CUTE,

05:27.428 --> 05:29.730
AND SOMETIMES LAURIE
GOES THROUGH MY TRASH--

05:29.730 --> 05:32.563
NOT TO GET FOOD, BUT SHE LIKES
TO TAKE MY OLD MAGAZINES.

05:32.563 --> 05:35.966
OH, WELL, THAT'S NORMAL.
WHY'D YOU SAY "YES" TO THIS?

05:35.966 --> 05:38.969
YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE WORST THING
ABOUT LAURIE--
STOP RIGHT THERE.

05:38.969 --> 05:41.612
GIRLFRIENDS DON'T TALK
BEHIND EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

05:41.612 --> 05:43.414
(laughing)

05:43.414 --> 05:46.046
(laughs)

05:46.046 --> 05:48.579
I COULDN'T KEEP
A STRAIGHT FACE.

05:48.579 --> 05:50.451
OKAY.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.723
SURE, LAURIE'S NOT
THE EASIEST HOUSEGUEST,

05:52.723 --> 05:54.625
BUT, HEY,
I'M EXCITED SHE'S COMING.
(door opens and closes)

05:54.625 --> 05:56.727
(high-pitched, singsong voice)
WHAT'S UP, SLEEPOVER?

05:56.727 --> 05:59.590
I PACKED LIGHT--JUST
MY SLEEP MASK AND SOME CONDOMS,

05:59.590 --> 06:02.362
'CAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW.
I USUALLY DO.

06:02.362 --> 06:06.036
THIS IS GONNA BE SO MUCHFUN!
I JUST NEED TO BORROW

06:06.036 --> 06:08.499
SOME TOOTHPASTE AND A TOOTHBRUSH
AND YOUR LADY RAZOR,

06:08.499 --> 06:11.001
OH, AND AN OUTFIT FOR TOMORROW.
I DON'T KNOW.

06:11.001 --> 06:13.944
(gasps) MAYBE A SKIRT TO
SHOW OFF MY DRUMSTICKS. WHA-BAM!

06:13.944 --> 06:17.007
THE ELLIPTICAL HAS BEEN
MY BITCH RECENTLY.

06:17.007 --> 06:19.810
I'LL JUST GO UP INTO YOUR CLOSET
AND I'LL ROOT AROUND,

06:19.810 --> 06:23.113
AND WE'LL FIND SOME STUFF.
HEY, ELLIE.
HEY, RACCOON.

06:23.113 --> 06:26.587
ARE YOU SURE THIS PICTURE
DOESN'T LOOK BETTER LIKE THIS?
QUIT IT. WE LOVE HER.

06:26.587 --> 06:30.160
(Laurie)
HEY, CAN I TRY ON THIS THONG?
YES!

06:30.160 --> 06:33.023
(singsongy) THANKS, HONEY!
I WILL KILL YOU.
(makes choking sound)

06:33.023 --> 06:34.525
(laughs)
HEY, LAURIE, WAIT!

06:34.525 --> 06:39.470
в™Єв™Єв™Є

06:46.076 --> 06:49.139
(lowered voice) AND DEAD. I WALK
OUTTA HERE THE WAY I CAME IN,

06:49.139 --> 06:51.141
THE POLICE PIN IT ON GRAYSON,

06:51.141 --> 06:54.144
HE SELLS ME HIS PUB
TO MAKE BAIL, AND WE FINALLY GET

06:54.144 --> 06:56.517
SOME GOOD NACHOS
IN THIS TOWN. WHAT?!

06:56.517 --> 06:59.920
GOOD MORNING, LAURIE.
COME DOWNSTAIRS. YOU CAN
CATCH UP TO ME ON COFFEE.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.053
I'M TWO POTS AHEAD.
TAG! YOU'RE IT!

07:03.053 --> 07:05.125
OH, GOD.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.927
ARE YOU AWAKE?

07:06.927 --> 07:09.099
WILL YOU COME WITH ME,
PLEASE?

07:09.099 --> 07:10.561
(mumbles) I LOVE YOU.

07:10.561 --> 07:13.103
ALL RIGHT, STAY ASLEEP.

07:13.103 --> 07:16.036
(groans)

07:16.036 --> 07:18.008
MY NACHOS ARE GREAT.

07:18.008 --> 07:21.912
I USE THREE KINDS OF CHEESES.
WHAT, WHAT?!

07:21.912 --> 07:23.914
I'M TAKING KIRSTEN OUT
TONIGHT,

07:23.914 --> 07:27.478
AND IT'S GOTTA BE MORE ROMANTIC
THAN A WEEKEND INPARIS.

07:27.478 --> 07:29.480
YOU KNOW WHAT'LL BEAT PARIS?
WHAT?

07:29.480 --> 07:32.122
NOTHING. YOU EVER BEEN?
IT'S BREATHTAKING.
STRONG START.
LET'S BUILD ON IT.

07:32.122 --> 07:35.125
I'M THIS CLOSE TO A GREAT IDEA,
BUT THE SOUND OF MY BREATH'S

07:35.125 --> 07:38.629
GETTING IN MY HEAD, SO I'M JUST
GONNA HOLD IT FOR A WHILE.
YOU WANT ROMANCE?

07:38.629 --> 07:41.992
FIRST, THROW ON
A NICE CUBAN SUIT--THEY EXIST--

07:41.992 --> 07:43.964
THEN TWO FLUTES OF CHAMPAGNE.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.867
OH, WHAT'S IN THE CHAMPAGNE?
A NECKLACE.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.800
WHAT'S IT MADE OF? DIAMONDS.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.943
(pops lips) GAME OVER.
YEAH, I'M POOR. NO DIAMONDS.

07:52.943 --> 07:55.976
BUT AT LEAST THE IDEAS
AREFLOWING.DAD?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.908
STILL WORKING ON IT.

07:57.908 --> 07:59.980
GRAYSON, I ASSUME
YOU'RE DAYDREAMING ABOUT PARIS?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.112
OH, THE CROISSANTS ARE SOFRESH.

08:02.112 --> 08:04.815
(exhales deeply) GOT IT.
WRITE HER A LOVE SONG.

08:04.815 --> 08:06.887
I SCRIBBLED DOWN
SOME TITLES.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.660
"'STAIRWAY TO KIRSTEN,'
'HOTEL KIRSTEN-FORNIA.'"

08:09.660 --> 08:12.663
DAD, YOU'RE JUST PUTTING
HER NAME IN YOUR FAVORITE SONGS.

08:12.663 --> 08:14.665
NOT ALL MY FAVORITES.
I DIDN'T WRITE DOWN

08:14.665 --> 08:16.667
"KIRSTEN AND JULIO
DOWN BY THE SCHOOLYARD"

08:16.667 --> 08:20.100
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE WAS
THROWING DOWN WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.703
"IN-A-GADDA-DA-KIRSTEN"?
"IT'S RAINING KIRSTENS"?

08:22.703 --> 08:24.875
"MY KIRST-ONA."

08:24.875 --> 08:26.006
(notepad hits floor)

08:26.006 --> 08:29.009
I HAD A FEELING
YOU'D BE BACK.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.240
(sighs)

08:30.240 --> 08:34.545
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS WRONG.
I JUST...

08:34.545 --> 08:37.648
MMM. I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE...

08:37.648 --> 08:39.650
WE MIGHT BE KINDRED SPIRITS.

08:39.650 --> 08:42.823
MY ONLY INTERESTS ARE DRINKING
WINE AND JUDGING PEOPLE.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.756
THEN I WAS RIGHT.
WAIT. WHAT AM I DOING?

08:45.756 --> 08:48.158
I SHOULD GO.

08:48.158 --> 08:50.561
YOU SEE THAT WOMAN
HAVING LUNCH?

08:50.561 --> 08:52.062
WITH THAT OVERBITE,

08:52.062 --> 08:54.565
SHE COULD EAT AN APPLE
THROUGH A CHAIN-LINK FENCE.

08:54.565 --> 08:56.737
APPLES?
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF HER.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.739
THEY PROBABLY
PUT UP THAT FENCE

08:58.739 --> 09:01.742
TO KEEP HER
OUT OF THE CUPCAKE STORE.
SEPARATED...

09:01.742 --> 09:03.043
AT...
BIRTH.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.015
(both) SOUL MATES.
(clink)

09:05.015 --> 09:08.278
IT HAS BEEN SUCH A BLAST

09:08.278 --> 09:10.320
SPENDING THIS MUCH TIME
WITH YOU.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.123
MM. YOU KNOW IT.
(crunching) MM.

09:13.123 --> 09:15.626
PLUS, I'M LEARNING
SO MUCH STUFF ABOUT MYSELF.

09:15.626 --> 09:17.127
FOR INSTANCE, APPARENTLY,

09:17.127 --> 09:20.160
MY HANDS LOOK OLDER THAN
THE REST OF MY BODY.
WELL, THEY DO.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.765
GREAT. AND, UH, ALSO MY SHOWER
SINGING IS "WIGGITY WHACK."

09:24.765 --> 09:27.167
TOTES WIGGITY WHACK.
AND NOW YOU HAVE MY CELL.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.340
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE GRAYSON
IN YOUR PHONE UNDER "G-LOVE."

09:30.340 --> 09:33.343
(singsongy) BARF!
LAURIE, I THINK
THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME

09:33.343 --> 09:36.246
FOR US TO TALK
ABOUT BOUNDARIES.
DON'T GOT NONE.

09:36.246 --> 09:38.348
JUST GO WITH ME.
NOW HOW WOULD YOU FEEL

09:38.348 --> 09:41.051
IF I WERE TO GO
THROUGHYOURCELL PHONE?

09:41.051 --> 09:44.855
FUN!WE CAN READ
EACH OTHER'S TEXT MESSAGES!

09:44.855 --> 09:47.858
"DEAR JULES, YOU'RE AWESOME.
LOVE JULES"?

09:47.858 --> 09:49.159
SERIOUSLY?

09:49.159 --> 09:51.792
SOMETIMES I TEXT MYSELF
A LITTLE PICK-ME-UP.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.164
"DEAR JULES,
YOU'RE NOT SO SPECIAL."

09:54.164 --> 09:56.096
SOMETIMES I GO THE OTHER WAY.
MM.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.868
ALL RIGHT.

09:57.868 --> 10:00.300
THAT WAS A GREAT TALK.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.372
LAURIE IS SO UP IN MY GRILL

10:02.372 --> 10:05.275
THAT I HAD TO PRETEND TO GO TO
WORK JUST TO GET AWAY FROM HER.

10:05.275 --> 10:08.378
I FEEL HORRIBLE.
YOU KNOW THAT POSTCARD
WITH THE FRENCH GUY ON A BIKE

10:08.378 --> 10:11.982
WITH A BAGUETTE UNDER HIS ARM?
IN PARIS, THAT'S REAL.

10:11.982 --> 10:14.184
SHOULD WE MOVE TO PARIS?

10:14.184 --> 10:17.187
YOU KNOW, AS MUCH AS I WOULD
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THAT

10:17.187 --> 10:19.189
FOR THE NEXT SIX HOURS,
I CAN'T,

10:19.189 --> 10:22.192
BECAUSE I'M NOT FUTURE GAL
ANYMORE, REMEMBER? I'M NOW GIRL.

10:22.192 --> 10:24.695
AND NOW GIRL
HAS A PROBLEMTODAY

10:24.695 --> 10:28.328
BECAUSE HER FRIEND LAURIE
WANTS TO GIVE HER CORNROWS.
(imitates Jamaican accent)
JULES GOT HER GROOVE BACK.

10:28.328 --> 10:32.102
OH, WHY?
WHY WOULD YOU DO IT?
(normal voice) LOOK,
COME CRASH AT MY PLACE TONIGHT.

10:32.102 --> 10:35.165
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GET REAL WITH HER.

10:35.165 --> 10:37.167
LITTLE LESSON
IN GIRL FRIENDSHIPS--

10:37.167 --> 10:40.671
UNLIKE MEN,
WE DON'T AVOID CONFLICT,

10:40.671 --> 10:43.714
AND WE'RE NOT BACKSTABBERS.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.178
YOU CAN COME OUT NOW.

10:48.178 --> 10:50.180
I WANT TO TRY THE ROSГ©.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.222
COME ON.
OKAY.

10:52.222 --> 10:55.655
NO. I AM HAVING A ROUGH DAY.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.259
PLEASEDON'T TRAP ME IN WITH
ONE OF YOUR GROSS BARB STORIES.

10:59.259 --> 11:03.133
JULES COBB, I AM A REAL ESTATE
PROFESSIONAL, SAME AS YOU,

11:03.133 --> 11:06.136
AND I HAVE COME HERE TO TELL YOU
ABOUT A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM

11:06.136 --> 11:08.238
I HAD WITH MY CLIENTS
AT ONE OF YOUR LISTINGS.

11:08.238 --> 11:11.341
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?
I HAD A PHYSICAL ISSUE
DURING THE WALK-THROUGH.

11:11.341 --> 11:13.343
I MEAN,
EVERYTHING'S OKAYNOW.

11:13.343 --> 11:15.706
IT JUST TURNS OUT
I'M HIGHLY ORGASMIC.

11:15.706 --> 11:17.908
SERIOUSLY,
I CAN'T WEAR CORDUROY.

11:17.908 --> 11:21.081
BARB TRAP.
THAT'S RIGHT! (laughing)

11:23.884 --> 11:25.786
SURPRISE! FRIEND ATTACK!

11:25.786 --> 11:28.018
OH, GOOD. YOU CAME HERE.

11:28.018 --> 11:30.460
OH, BOY. LOOK AT THAT ONE
WITH THE CURLY HAIR.

11:30.460 --> 11:33.824
UGH. THAT WILL NOT BE CUTE
WHEN SHE'S OVER 10.

11:33.824 --> 11:34.995
YEAH. (chuckles)

11:34.995 --> 11:37.127
I SHOULD GO.
TODAY WAS MAGICAL.

11:37.127 --> 11:38.829
SAME TIME TOMORROW?

11:38.829 --> 11:40.100
OF COURSE.
ALL RIGHT.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.233
OH, AND SAY "HI" TO YOUR
LOW-RENT FRIEND FOR ME, WILL YA?

11:43.233 --> 11:45.776
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
WITH HAIR SO JET-BLACK

11:45.776 --> 11:47.778
SHE LOOKS LIKE A CROW?

11:47.778 --> 11:49.780
(caws)

11:49.780 --> 11:52.082
I WILL.

11:52.082 --> 11:56.086
ONLY TWO HOURS UNTIL MY ROMANTIC
DATE, AND WE STILL GOT NOTHING.

11:56.086 --> 11:58.348
WHAT ABOUT
MY 2-PERSON TATTOO IDEA?

11:58.348 --> 12:01.191
I DREW ONE ON SO YOU'D GET IT.

12:01.191 --> 12:02.853
POW! (chuckles)

12:02.853 --> 12:05.455
IF I GET DRUNK LATER,
WE'RE MAKING THIS REAL.

12:05.455 --> 12:08.458
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD, BUT I THINK
I'M GONNA SAVE THAT IDEA

12:08.458 --> 12:11.401
FOR WHEN I'M DATING A DUDE...
IN PRISON. OKAY, I GOTTA GO.

12:11.401 --> 12:14.865
OH, HEY, GRAYSON. DO ME A SOLID?
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

12:14.865 --> 12:18.068
HIT ME UP WITH SOME OF THAT
INSINCERE ROMANTIC GIBBERISH

12:18.068 --> 12:20.941
YOU USED TO USE TO BAG CHICKS.
MM. I'LL DIAL UP SOME CLASSICS.
(chuckles)

12:20.941 --> 12:23.173
HE'S LEANING ON YOU
FOR THIS

12:23.173 --> 12:26.216
LIKE YOU'RE HIS DAD
ALL OF A SUDDEN.
HE CAME TOME.WHAT THE HELL
WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

12:26.216 --> 12:28.178
THAT'S WHY I'M A BETTER FRIEND
THAN YOU ARE. I ALWAYS

12:28.178 --> 12:32.853
PUT MYSELF IN MY BUDDY'S SHOES.
IF I WERE DATING THE EX-WIFE

12:32.853 --> 12:35.856
OF A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE
AND THEIR SON CAME TO ME,

12:35.856 --> 12:38.859
I WOULD DAMN WELL REALIZE THAT
YOU--AND BY "YOU," I MEAN ME--

12:38.859 --> 12:41.862
WAS STEPPING ON YOUR--MY--TOES.
NOTYOURYOUR-MY TOES,

12:41.862 --> 12:46.236
BUT I MEAN MINE, AS IN
THE FLIPPED VERSION OF US.
RIGHT. THAT MAKES SENSE.

12:46.236 --> 12:49.139
OH, MAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT.

12:54.905 --> 12:58.048
OKAY, UH, LAURIE, I WANNA
BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU.

12:58.048 --> 13:00.350
I'M SURE YOU CAN TELL
THAT I'M A LITTLE TOUCHY

13:00.350 --> 13:03.814
WITH MY PERSONAL SPACE.
LIKE HOW YOU FREAKED WHEN
I HOPPED IN THE TUB WITH YOU?

13:03.814 --> 13:06.086
I'M WEIRD LIKE THAT. LOOK,

13:06.086 --> 13:08.518
I'M SORRY, BUT, UM,
HAVING A HOUSEGUEST

13:08.518 --> 13:11.221
IS JUST A LITTLE TOO MUCH
FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

13:11.221 --> 13:13.223
SO I THINK YOU SHOULD GET
A HOTEL ROOM TONIGHT.

13:13.223 --> 13:16.366
UH, MY TREAT.
THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL JUST GO BACK HOME.

13:16.366 --> 13:19.369
BUT YOU'RE HAVING
YOUR PLACE PAINTED.
NOPE. I JUST THOUGHT

13:19.369 --> 13:22.272
IT'D BE A KICK TO CRASH
WITH YOU FOR THE WEEKEND.

13:22.272 --> 13:24.174
A KICK?
TOTES KICK.

13:24.174 --> 13:26.877
TOTES KICK. WOW.

13:26.877 --> 13:29.239
OKAY, SO YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS OKAY TO LIE

13:29.239 --> 13:33.413
AND TORTURE ME LIKE
SOME SORT OF SPACE INVADER?

13:33.413 --> 13:36.947
LAURIE, I'M AT THE POINT
WHERE THE SOUND OF YOUR VOICE

13:36.947 --> 13:39.419
IS MORE UPSETTING TO ME
THAN THOSE INTERNET VIDEOS

13:39.419 --> 13:42.152
OF FOREIGN BABIES SMOKING.

13:42.152 --> 13:45.225
I HAVE NEVER SPENT AN EVENING
WITH SUCH AN ANNOYING PERSON.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.227
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

13:47.227 --> 13:50.260
BECAUSE I MISSED YOU.

13:52.062 --> 13:55.065
I KNOW YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH GRAYSON, AND THAT'S COOL,

13:55.065 --> 13:57.067
BUT I'VE BEEN FEELING
BOXED OUT,

13:57.067 --> 13:59.239
AND SO...

13:59.239 --> 14:03.143
I MADE UP A REASON FOR US
TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER.

14:03.143 --> 14:06.146
I'M REALLY SORRY IT SUCKED
SO BAD FOR YOU, JULES.

14:08.248 --> 14:13.053
HOW IS IT THAT YOU MADEME
FEEL LIKE THE JERK?

14:13.053 --> 14:15.125
WHAT CAN I TELL YA?

14:15.125 --> 14:17.287
I'M GOOD.

14:25.035 --> 14:26.967
(door closes)

14:26.967 --> 14:30.140
WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY?
I JUST SAID THE MOST HORRIBLE
STUFF TO LAURIE.

14:30.140 --> 14:32.372
SHE'S UPSTAIRS RIGHT NOW
GRABBING HER THINGS.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.304
THANKS FOR INCLUDING ME.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.508
HEY, G-LOVE.

14:38.508 --> 14:41.011
ALL RIGHT,
SEE YOU, SWEETIE. BYE.

14:42.612 --> 14:45.055
SHE'S A SHELL OF HERSELF.
(door opens and closes)

14:45.055 --> 14:46.556
WHAT THE HELL?

14:46.556 --> 14:50.520
I WAS SO MEAN. ANY FRIEND
WOULD BE CRUSHED BY THAT.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.593
WOW. IT MAKES ME QUESTION
WHETHER SHE EVEN CARES ABOUT ME.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.596
SO YOU'RE MAD AT HER
FOR NOT BEING MAD AT YOU

14:56.596 --> 14:58.598
FOR SAYING MEAN THINGS
ABOUT HER? (chuckles)

14:58.598 --> 15:01.231
THAT RIGHT THERE
IS GIRL FRIENDSHIPS.

15:01.231 --> 15:03.673
AND THAT RIGHT THERE...
IS A STUPID FACE.

15:05.475 --> 15:08.478
WHAT'S UP? I'M IN A RUSH.
I GOTTA PICK UP KIRSTEN,

15:08.478 --> 15:12.382
AND I CAN'T REACH GRAYSON TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING.
OH, THAT'S BECAUSE
I TOLD HIM NOT TO TALK TO YOU.

15:12.382 --> 15:16.186
(thud)
OH, THAT'S GREAT. I'M GLAD
YOU'RE TAKING AN ACTIVE ROLE

15:16.186 --> 15:19.249
IN RUINING MY RELATIONSHIP.
TRAV, I KNOW I'M BEING
OVERLY SENSITIVE,

15:19.249 --> 15:22.252
BUT I JUST DON'T LIKE YOU GOING
TO GRAYSON FOR DAD STUFF.
(groans)

15:22.252 --> 15:24.224
I WANT YOU TO COME TOME
FOR ADVICE,

15:24.224 --> 15:26.356
YOU KNOW, AND IF IT'S NOT
IN MY WHEELHOUSE,

15:26.356 --> 15:29.159
YOU KNOW, LIKE, ROMANCE
OR INVESTMENTS...

15:29.159 --> 15:31.161
CAREER STUFF, CURRENT EVENTS,
VACATION IDEAS,

15:31.161 --> 15:34.064
HAIRSTYLES, HEALTHY FOODS--
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL FINISH
THAT LIST LATER.

15:34.064 --> 15:37.267
LOOK, THE POINT IS,
IF I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT,

15:37.267 --> 15:40.240
WE'LL FIND SOMEONE WHO DOES.
OKAY, DAD.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.313
THANK YOU. NOW PARK IT.

15:43.313 --> 15:45.615
I'VE BEEN HOLDING MY BREATH...
(exhales deeply)

15:45.615 --> 15:48.648
THINKING ABOUT THIS ROMANCE,
AND IT FINALLY DAWNED ON ME.

15:48.648 --> 15:52.252
ALL RIGHT, IT'S NOT ABOUT PARIS,
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT TATTOOS.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.584
IF YOU'RE WITH THE RIGHT GAL,

15:54.584 --> 15:58.388
IT'S ALL ABOUT
CREATING A MOMENT.
LIKE WHAT?

15:58.388 --> 16:01.461
DAD, LIKE WHAT?
I HEARD YA. I JUST THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA COME BY

16:01.461 --> 16:04.364
IN, LIKE, 20 MINUTES,
WHEN IT GETS DARK.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.266
JUST WAIT.

16:08.238 --> 16:09.439
(guzzles) MMM.

16:09.439 --> 16:12.702
OH. I JUST OPENED
THE MOST AMAZING MERLOT.

16:12.702 --> 16:15.005
HAVE YOU EVER TASTED MISCHIEF?

16:15.005 --> 16:17.207
WAYNE,
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BEFORE,

16:17.207 --> 16:19.179
BUT YOU WERE MEAN
TO MY FRIEND,

16:19.179 --> 16:22.612
AND IF YOU DO IT AGAIN,
YOU'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH ME.
OKAY.

16:22.612 --> 16:24.084
GOOD.

16:24.084 --> 16:27.557
(high-pitched voice) CAW!

16:29.189 --> 16:31.291
IT IS SO ON.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.193
WHAT UP, NAKED LADY?

16:33.193 --> 16:36.626
YOU WANTED TO TALK.
I KNOW I'M EARLY, SO I THOUGHT--
YOU JUST CAME RIGHT UP?

16:38.998 --> 16:41.231
LAURIE, THIS DOESN'T
MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE?

16:41.231 --> 16:42.202
NOPE.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.634
WHAT ABOUT THIS? WHOO!

16:44.634 --> 16:46.036
WHOO!

16:46.036 --> 16:47.337
LOOKS LIKE FUN!

16:47.337 --> 16:50.280
THOSE GIRLS ARE MOVIN'.
LADY, YOU LOOK GOOD.

16:50.280 --> 16:53.012
THANK YOU. (chuckles)

16:53.012 --> 16:56.186
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD
COMPLIMENT ME AFTER WHAT I SAID.

16:56.186 --> 16:59.249
HEY, FRIENDS ALWAYS HAVE
EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

16:59.249 --> 17:01.251
I KNOW YOU FANCY YOURSELF

17:01.251 --> 17:03.253
THE QUEEN OF MEAN
AROUND THESE PARTS,

17:03.253 --> 17:05.325
BUT WAYNE GIBBONS
IS NOT SCARED

17:05.325 --> 17:08.098
OF SOME UNEMPLOYED
SUBURBAN HAUSFRAU

17:08.098 --> 17:12.332
WHO DRESSES LIKE DIANE KEATON'S
MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, MUCH,

17:12.332 --> 17:15.305
MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, MUCH,
MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, MUCH,

17:15.305 --> 17:18.708
MUCHOLDER... SISTER.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.210
IS IT--IS IT MY TURN?

17:20.210 --> 17:22.572
YEAH, IT IS. SHE TEXTED ME.

17:22.572 --> 17:26.246
SHE KNOWS IT TURNS ME ON
WHEN SHE CRUSHES PEOPLE.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.249
THAT'S A NICE TOUGH GUY ACT,
BUT I SEE THROUGH YOU, WAYNE.

17:29.249 --> 17:33.253
I SEE THROUGH ALL THE WAY TO
THAT LITTLE BOY WHO WORE GLASSES

17:33.253 --> 17:35.755
AND SAT IN THE CORNER WONDERING
WHY HE COULDN'T FIND ONE FRIEND

17:35.755 --> 17:38.188
TO BUILD MODEL AIRPLANES
WITH HIM.

17:38.188 --> 17:40.430
(whispers)
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE, NERD.

17:40.430 --> 17:42.692
(normal voice)
SO IF YOU EVER SAY

17:42.692 --> 17:44.694
MEAN THINGS ABOUT JULES AGAIN,

17:44.694 --> 17:48.768
I WILL COME ACROSS THAT BAR,
TAKE YOUR...

17:48.768 --> 17:51.301
...AND I WILL STOMP
ALL OVER YOUR GRAPES.

17:51.301 --> 17:53.703
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME,
WAYNE?

17:53.703 --> 17:55.205
YES, MA'AM.

17:55.205 --> 17:58.308
ANDY, YOU WANNA
TAKE ME HOME NOW?

17:58.308 --> 18:00.510
ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:00.510 --> 18:02.212
THANK YOU.

18:02.212 --> 18:04.784
I'M SORRY ABOUT
EVERYTHING I SAID.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.786
AND I'M SORRY
FOR NOT BEING MAD ENOUGH

18:06.786 --> 18:10.089
WHEN YOU SAID
ALL THOSE HORRIBLE THINGS TO ME.
IT'S OKAY.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.091
I KNOW I CAN BE ANNOYING.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.093
LAURIE KELLER IS
A BIG PERSONALITY.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.267
SERIOUSLY, I'M LIKE--OH,
I DON'T KNOW, WHAT IS THE WORD?

18:17.267 --> 18:19.569
UM, I'M GUESSING... WHA-BAM?

18:19.569 --> 18:22.372
YEAH. WHA-BAM!
OOH. (chuckles)

18:22.372 --> 18:24.374
JULES, I GET
IN PEOPLE'S PERSONAL SPACE.

18:24.374 --> 18:27.407
I'M LOUD, AND NOT JUST
MY VOICE--MY CLOTHES, MY MAKEUP,

18:27.407 --> 18:29.379
MY JEWELRY.
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,

18:29.379 --> 18:32.482
THIS NECKLACE COULD BE
A BELT BUCKLE.

18:32.482 --> 18:35.485
USUALLY WHEN I'M GETTING
ON YOUR NERVES, I CAN TELL,

18:35.485 --> 18:37.787
AND I DIAL IT BACK.
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS JUST--

18:37.787 --> 18:40.850
I WAS REALLY PSYCHED TO SPEND
THE WEEKEND WITH YOU, AND...

18:40.850 --> 18:43.723
YOU GOT JIMMIED UP.
OH, I WAS RIDICULOUS.

18:43.723 --> 18:48.398
(laughs) BUT WHAT THE HELL?
YOU KNOW, I AM WHO I AM, RIGHT?

18:48.398 --> 18:50.400
THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU--

18:50.400 --> 18:52.832
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO COMFORTABLE
IN YOUR OWN SKIN.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.434
WELL, COME ON, YOU ARE, TOO.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.337
REMEMBER THE NAKED DANCE
UPSTAIRS?

18:57.337 --> 19:00.370
A-WHOO!
WHOO! THE WORST FOUR SECONDS
OF MY LIFE.

19:00.370 --> 19:04.314
(chuckles)
IWISHI COULD BE
MORE COMFORTABLE WITH WHO I AM.

19:04.314 --> 19:06.546
I WISH I COULD BE
MORE LIKE YOU.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.778
(whimpers)

19:08.778 --> 19:12.182
IS THAT THE FIRST TIME
ANYONE'S EVER SAID THAT TO YOU?

19:12.182 --> 19:13.253
YEAH.

19:13.253 --> 19:16.286
I LOVE YOU.
OHH!

19:16.286 --> 19:20.190
OKAY. ASK ME AGAIN
ABOUT THAT ROMANTIC MOMENT.

19:20.190 --> 19:22.232
DAD, LIKE WHAT?

19:22.232 --> 19:23.393
LIKE THIS...

19:23.393 --> 19:24.534
(click)

19:24.534 --> 19:26.165
(gasps)

19:26.165 --> 19:27.797
WHAT?

19:27.797 --> 19:29.899
LOOK AT THE MOON
OVER THE OCEAN.

19:29.899 --> 19:31.641
MM-HMM.
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

19:31.641 --> 19:35.245
SO ARE YOU.
YOU'RE PRETTY PROUD
OF YOURSELF, AREN'T YOU?

19:35.245 --> 19:37.947
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I DO WHAT I DO.

19:37.947 --> 19:41.411
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:41.411 --> 19:44.954
YOU KNOW, YOUR BOAT
ACTUALLY LOOKS NOT CREEPY

19:44.954 --> 19:47.557
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN, LIKE...

19:47.557 --> 19:48.958
EVER.

19:48.958 --> 19:51.821
HEY, BUDDY,
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

19:51.821 --> 19:54.464
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
TAKE THE CREDIT, MAN.

19:54.464 --> 19:56.566
I GOT YOUR BACK, BUDDY.

19:56.566 --> 20:01.271
I FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD
WATCHING.
YEAH, THEY ARE GETTING
A LITTLE HANDS-Y.

20:01.271 --> 20:04.304
TO THE BAR.
PLEASE.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.575
(glass clinks)

20:05.575 --> 20:07.277
GO AHEAD.

20:07.277 --> 20:11.341
UH, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
SOME OF THE, UM, FANCY WINE.

20:11.341 --> 20:13.283
BUT HER HAIR--

20:13.283 --> 20:15.445
DO IT, WAYNE.

20:15.445 --> 20:18.248
OH, NO, NO.
I BROUGHT MY OWN GLASS.

20:18.248 --> 20:21.921
THIS IS BIG CARL.
FILL HIM UP.

20:23.453 --> 20:24.894
(all cheer)

20:24.894 --> 20:26.456
(Andy) WHOO-WHOO-WHOO!

20:26.456 --> 20:28.428
в™Єв™Єв™Є

20:28.428 --> 20:31.431
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THIS GROUP'S
GONNA BE 20 YEARS FROM NOW?

20:31.431 --> 20:35.004
I THOUGHT FUTURE GAL
WAS DEAD.
I'VE DECIDED TO OWN IT.
DEAL WITH IT.

20:35.004 --> 20:37.437
ATTAGIRL.
WHAT'D YOU DO?

20:37.437 --> 20:39.739
BOY FRIENDSHIPS OR GIRL
FRIENDSHIPS--IT DOESN'T MATTER.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.272
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE LIKE
ELLIE'S BRIDESMAID PHOTO.

20:42.272 --> 20:44.314
NO ONE HERE IS
EVER GONNA BE EXED OUT.

20:44.314 --> 20:45.815
CHEERS.
CHEERS AGAIN!

20:45.815 --> 20:48.648
OOH, I WANT THAT PHOTO.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.851
WAYNE, TAKE A PICTURE
WITH MY CELL.
DO I LOOK LIKE THE TYPE THAT--

20:51.851 --> 20:54.684
WAYNE.
THREE, TWO, ONE.

20:54.684 --> 20:57.287
(camera shutter clicks)

21:03.463 --> 21:05.465
OKAY,
I PUT TOGETHER AN ALBUM

21:05.465 --> 21:07.767
OF ALL THE PEOPLE YOU'RE
NO LONGER FRIENDS WITH,

21:07.767 --> 21:09.769
AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.801
OKAY.
OH, MISSED MY BIRTHDAY PARTY.

21:11.801 --> 21:13.673
TALKED BEHIND MY BACK.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.976
OH, TOO HAPPY ALL THE TIME,
SAID OUR HOUSE WAS "QUAINT,"

21:16.976 --> 21:19.979
NAMED HER DAUGHTER CHESAPEAKE,
TOO OLD FOR HAIR THAT LONG,

21:19.979 --> 21:22.952
ALWAYS TRIED TO HUG ME, CALLS
HER HUSBAND "HURRICANE FRANK"...
FRANK.

21:22.952 --> 21:26.015
VEGAN, VEGAN, VEGAN--
THEY WERE ALL FRIENDS.

21:26.015 --> 21:27.817
DOESN'T LIKE HOWARD STERN,

21:27.817 --> 21:30.820
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY
TO SQUIRT ME WITH A HOSE.
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

21:30.820 --> 21:33.963
HUSBAND IS A TOOL,
RAN A MARATHON, DOESN'T DRINK.

21:33.963 --> 21:37.327
OH, AND THE LAST ONE'S EASY
'CAUSE IT'S YOUR MOM.

21:37.327 --> 21:38.728
GREAT.
