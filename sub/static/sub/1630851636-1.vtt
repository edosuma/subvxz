Take care, Gavin.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.787
Yeah, let's make sure
that champagne is ice-cold.

00:20.854 --> 00:21.788
What's your address again?

00:21.855 --> 00:24.090
Hey, Gavin. You got a pen?

00:26.593 --> 00:27.827
Thank you.

00:27.894 --> 00:30.463
(chuckles)
All right.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.066
Okay, we'll see
you then. Okay.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.635
You're planning a celebration
for this verdict?

00:35.702 --> 00:38.705
Yeah. My client's very happy.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.440

on life support since the jump,

00:44.844 --> 00:47.580
Gavin, I wouldn't be so quick
to call time of death,

00:47.647 --> 00:50.250
especially if you knew what
my mirror jury was thinking.

00:50.316 --> 00:52.085
I don't put much stock
in fake juries.

00:52.152 --> 00:55.422
The only thing that matters is
what the real jury has to say.

00:55.488 --> 00:57.490
My fake juries are always on
the money, and I'm telling you,

00:57.557 --> 00:59.192
there are pitchforks and
torches over this one.

somewhere else, Bull.

MIRROR JUROR:
Why is this even a discussion?

01:03.363 --> 01:06.266
They're evil sons of bitches.

01:06.332 --> 01:07.801
We should burn that place
to the ground.

01:07.867 --> 01:09.636
What... What is that?

01:09.702 --> 01:12.238
It's my mirror jury.
You want to hear some more?

01:12.305 --> 01:13.606
No.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.811
Fine. Just show me.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.152

$10 million. No.

Jason!

08:13.826 --> 08:15.695
(ringing stops)

08:15.761 --> 08:17.897
No. No!
We are not calling the police.

08:15.761 --> 08:17.897
Astrid is gone!

08:17.964 --> 08:19.065
He said no police!

08:19.131 --> 08:20.299
They could be
watching, okay?

08:20.366 --> 08:22.702
We don't want them
to do anything stupid.

08:22.768 --> 08:24.203
But we need to save her.

08:22.768 --> 08:24.203
We know two things.
Know two things. Listen to me.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.005
We need to find her.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.005
Two things. We know

08:26.072 --> 08:27.907
that they want money,
and we can get money.

08:27.974 --> 08:30.743
And we also know
if we call the police,

08:30.810 --> 08:32.979
they said
that they would kill Astrid.

08:33.045 --> 08:36.015
The math is simple.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.850
No police.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.720
(breathing heavily)

08:40.786 --> 08:42.054
Okay.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.557
All right. Come here.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.747
If you can't handle it,
just say so.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.749
I will find someone who can.

09:09.815 --> 09:11.317
CHUNK:
So,

09:11.384 --> 09:13.986
who knew that you babysit
for the Bulls

09:14.053 --> 09:15.655
every Friday night?

09:14.053 --> 09:15.655
I don't know. I don't know.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.223
Your boyfriend or roommates?

09:17.290 --> 09:18.824
No, I-I don't... I
don't have a boyfriend.

09:18.891 --> 09:19.959
I live with my parents.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.028
Nobody I know would take Astrid.

09:22.094 --> 09:24.330
It was the food delivery guy.
I already told you.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.666
Okay.
But how would the kidnapper know

09:26.732 --> 09:27.967
you were gonna be ordering food?

09:28.034 --> 09:30.202
I don't know.
I-I don't know. The...

09:30.269 --> 09:32.038
I order food
every time I babysit.

09:32.104 --> 09:33.940
The-the Bulls,
th-they pay for it.

09:34.006 --> 09:35.741
Th-They tell me to do it.

09:34.006 --> 09:35.741
MARISSA:
Bull?

09:35.808 --> 09:38.844
(crying): Oh, my God,
why did I open the door?

09:38.911 --> 09:41.147
Well, I... (exhales)
I've secured the money.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.147
Excellent.

09:41.213 --> 09:42.915
I have a contact
who's high up at a Swiss bank.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.850
He understands
that you don't want to raise

09:44.917 --> 09:46.319
any red flags.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.319
Right.

09:46.385 --> 09:48.054
His colleague in New York

09:48.120 --> 09:50.022
will have the cash here
in a couple hours,

09:50.089 --> 09:52.191
but you will have to put
your apartment up as collateral.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.793
Yeah, that's fine. You know

09:53.859 --> 09:55.394
I'll sign anything.

09:55.461 --> 09:56.929
(exhales)

09:56.996 --> 09:58.998
What-what are you doing?

09:56.996 --> 09:58.998
You know, it's just...

10:00.800 --> 10:03.836
...been bothering me. What if
this isn't about the money?

10:03.903 --> 10:06.105
I mean, it's like...

10:06.172 --> 10:07.340
Why us?

10:07.406 --> 10:08.908
There's so many families
in New York

10:08.975 --> 10:11.744
that would drop ten
or $20 million

10:11.811 --> 10:13.279
without even breaking a sweat.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.614
Why us?

10:16.382 --> 10:19.185
I made a lot of enemies
since I started TAC.

10:19.251 --> 10:22.388
You think this is because
of something you did?

10:22.455 --> 10:25.358
I'll create an algorithm
to sort through past cases,

10:25.424 --> 10:27.893
identify
the most likely suspects.

10:25.424 --> 10:27.893
Thank you.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.898
(sighs)

10:33.899 --> 10:36.802
I'm-I'm so sorry
if this is my fault.

10:33.899 --> 10:36.802
No.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.338
We don't have time for this.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.073
We don't have time to lay blame.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.377
Just-just figure out
who has our baby.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.313
(exhales)

10:47.380 --> 10:49.115
I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

10:49.181 --> 10:51.217
My ringer was off. I came
as soon as I saw your message.

10:51.283 --> 10:52.385
You're here.
That's all that matters.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.220
We got a lot of work to do.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.957
Are we really doing this?

10:58.024 --> 11:00.393
Bull's not calling
the police?

11:00.459 --> 11:02.294
Is he okay?
I mean, of course,

11:02.361 --> 11:03.863
he's not. I just...

11:03.929 --> 11:05.131
Are we sure
we're making the right call?

11:05.197 --> 11:06.732
Because
if someone took Mauricio,

11:06.799 --> 11:08.034
I wouldn't be able
to think straight.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.069
Bull thinks
this is related to TAC.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.138
We know our cases
better than anyone.

11:12.204 --> 11:14.140
We...

11:14.206 --> 11:15.841
TAYLOR:
Izzy.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.343
I'm so sorry.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.944
I can't even imagine what
you're going through.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.113
If there's anything
I can do, anything...

11:21.180 --> 11:23.416
IZZY: Thank you.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.416
Danny is sending
some security footage

11:23.482 --> 11:24.817
from the apartment building.

11:24.884 --> 11:26.085
It's a clip of
the deliveryman

11:26.152 --> 11:28.721
who took Astrid.

11:30.890 --> 11:31.991
Play it for me.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.126
We haven't seen it yet. Maybe...

11:34.193 --> 11:35.761
Just play it. Please.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.440
That can't be him.
He doesn't have Astrid.

11:47.506 --> 11:49.375
Where's-where's Astrid?

11:50.342 --> 11:54.880
I... think she's in the bag.

11:57.516 --> 12:00.052
(crying):
But she can't breathe in there.

12:00.119 --> 12:01.787
Oh, my God.

12:00.119 --> 12:01.787
I'm sure she can breathe.

12:01.854 --> 12:03.255
IZZY:
She's dead, isn't she?

12:01.854 --> 12:03.255
No, she's still alive.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.091
I'm sure she's still alive.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.091
IZZY:
She's dead.

12:05.157 --> 12:08.360
Okay, just forget about
the bag, Izzy. Izzy?

12:05.157 --> 12:08.360
She's dead.

12:08.427 --> 12:10.996
Okay, look at that man.
We need you. Astrid

12:11.063 --> 12:13.165
needs you to focus on him.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.165
(sobbing): She's dead.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.867
Just look-look closely.

12:14.934 --> 12:18.270
Do you recognize him? Have you
seen him anywhere before?

12:18.337 --> 12:21.407
No, I've never seen...
I can't even see his face.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.110
I don't know who that is.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.110
It's okay.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.978
Don't worry.
Danny's still on this.

12:26.045 --> 12:28.247
She is hitting every building
on your block.

12:28.314 --> 12:30.516
She's checking
their exterior cameras.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.218
My baby.

12:32.284 --> 12:34.120
We will find this man.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.455
Okay?

12:36.522 --> 12:38.491
Okay.

12:40.493 --> 12:44.230
TIFFANY:
Duct tape around my mouth.

12:44.296 --> 12:46.031
Around your mouth
and your shoulders.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.433
TIFFANY:
Around my waist.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.201
CHUNK:
Okay.

12:54.473 --> 12:56.942
I have been over her story

12:57.009 --> 12:58.544
forward,
sideways and all around.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.946
She wasn't in on this.
I'm sure of it.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.150
Does she remember any other
details about the kidnapper?

13:04.216 --> 13:06.519
Other than he was
carrying a gun?

13:06.585 --> 13:08.387
Nothing.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.156
Look, she's really shaken up.

13:10.222 --> 13:11.991
I don't think we're gonna get
much more out of her.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.360
Wait a second.

13:15.861 --> 13:18.397
Does anybody have
anything lavender-scented?

13:18.464 --> 13:21.200
I don't know. Maybe. Why?

13:21.267 --> 13:25.371
Astrid's room
smells like lavender.

13:27.373 --> 13:30.276
I tried to kick him,

13:30.342 --> 13:33.846
but he tied my legs up, too.

13:33.913 --> 13:36.549
Right. And, so, when
he was tying you up,

13:36.615 --> 13:39.385
did you get a look at his face?

13:39.451 --> 13:42.555
Did you see his eyes?
What color they were, maybe?

13:42.621 --> 13:44.390
No, I c...

13:44.456 --> 13:46.559
I-I can't... I can't see them.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.394
(crying):
I can't remember.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.296
It's okay.

13:51.263 --> 13:55.201
I just need you
to breathe in the lavender

13:55.267 --> 13:57.336
and just relax.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.405
Put yourself there.

14:02.608 --> 14:05.578
I-I can see his hat.

14:05.644 --> 14:09.081
It's black, but it's faded.

14:09.148 --> 14:10.482
Almost gray.

14:10.549 --> 14:13.052
Anything else?

14:15.020 --> 14:18.090
I was screaming, I think.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.090
Okay.

14:18.157 --> 14:20.359
So he put something in my mouth.

14:20.426 --> 14:23.162
(sniffles)
And...

14:23.229 --> 14:25.197
Then he picked up Astrid, and...

14:25.264 --> 14:27.132
she was crying so hard.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.035
And I'm-I'm so sorry.
I tried to tell her

14:30.102 --> 14:31.604
that it was gonna be okay,
but I couldn't.

14:30.102 --> 14:31.604
Oh, no, no.

14:31.670 --> 14:34.139
I couldn't. I'm sorry.

14:31.670 --> 14:34.139
It's okay. It's okay. Tiffany,

14:34.206 --> 14:36.642
you're doing a great job here.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.078
Okay? And you didn't do
anything wrong.

14:40.079 --> 14:42.581
This is not your fault.

14:44.083 --> 14:48.087
I just need you to remember
as much as you can.

14:48.153 --> 14:50.089
So, you couldn't see his face.

14:50.155 --> 14:52.224
Did you hear his...

14:52.291 --> 14:54.326
Did you hear his voice?

14:54.393 --> 14:57.963
Did... did you hear what
his voice sounded like, maybe?

14:58.030 --> 15:01.433
Like, uh, was there an accent?

15:01.500 --> 15:05.971
(sniffles)
No. I don't think so.

15:06.038 --> 15:08.107
So you're there.

15:08.173 --> 15:11.210
And he's taking Astrid.
She was crying.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.282
Did he say anything to her?

15:16.348 --> 15:19.418
Did he try and shush her
or quiet her down?

15:19.485 --> 15:21.687
No. No. He didn't say
anything to her.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.255
Not that I can remember.

15:23.322 --> 15:25.257
He just took her and left?

15:23.322 --> 15:25.257
Mm-hmm.

15:25.324 --> 15:28.527
Okay.

15:25.324 --> 15:28.527
Mm, no.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.497
Before he walked out,
he said something.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.632
(sniffles)

15:33.699 --> 15:36.702
"Tell Dr. Jason to answer
the phone when I call."

15:36.769 --> 15:40.239
He said Dr. Jason?
He didn't say Dr. Bull?

15:40.306 --> 15:41.940
Yeah.

15:43.742 --> 15:45.477
MARISSA:
She remembered something?

15:45.544 --> 15:46.979
What did she say?

15:47.046 --> 15:48.547
Well, the kidnapper
called me Dr. Jason.

15:48.614 --> 15:52.451
Before we started TAC, I worked
at this juvenile clinic.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.286
The kids called me Dr. Jason.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.288
I dealt with maybe
a hundred teenagers,

15:56.355 --> 15:58.590
some of them were
pretty tough cases.

15:58.657 --> 16:00.526
Where would my psych files be?

16:00.592 --> 16:02.161
Try over there.

16:10.235 --> 16:12.304
What do you mean
by "tough cases"?

16:12.371 --> 16:16.342
Well, I dealt with some severe
psychiatric disorders.

16:16.408 --> 16:17.743
Here we go.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.112
The kidnapper's file
should be in this box.

16:21.113 --> 16:22.614
And you're telling me that
there's a good chance

16:22.681 --> 16:24.183
that he's mentally...

16:24.249 --> 16:27.353
Disturbed. Yeah.

16:30.456 --> 16:33.525
(crying)

16:37.196 --> 16:39.365
No!

16:39.431 --> 16:41.166
Shut up!

16:43.669 --> 16:46.305
(crying continues)

17:01.453 --> 17:03.522
Hey, man! Open up!
It's an emergency!

17:03.589 --> 17:04.590
I need your help!

17:04.656 --> 17:06.091
We're closed!

17:04.656 --> 17:06.091
It's...

17:06.158 --> 17:07.693
It's an emergency.
I need your help.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.328
Cerrado hoy.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.430
I just need to look at
your security camera.

17:11.497 --> 17:12.698
Go home!

17:12.765 --> 17:14.500
I'm not trying to
buy chips or a beer.

17:14.566 --> 17:16.235
Oh!

17:25.210 --> 17:27.579
(alarm blaring)

17:27.646 --> 17:29.481
Are you crazy?!
I'm calling the cops!

17:29.548 --> 17:31.683
Listen, man, don't call
the cops. No cops.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.819
Look, I've got $10,000
in my back pocket.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.220
I'm just gonna get it.

17:35.287 --> 17:36.455
Don't try anything!

17:36.522 --> 17:37.389
Look, it should
more than cover

17:37.456 --> 17:38.824
the cost of the door.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.359
I just need to look
at the security footage

17:40.426 --> 17:42.227
of your outside camera here,
all right?

17:43.395 --> 17:45.097
Right now.

17:52.337 --> 17:53.739
Thank you.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.407
I can't tell you how much
we appreciate this.

17:55.474 --> 17:58.277
You're welcome.
I really hope it works out.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.586
The babysitter finally
fell asleep.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.254
Poor thing.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.254
Yeah.

18:09.321 --> 18:10.389
We've got the ransom.

18:10.456 --> 18:11.757
Great.
That's something at least.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.792
Did the banker count it all out
in front of you?

18:13.859 --> 18:16.295
No, but I'm sure it's all...

18:13.859 --> 18:16.295
Okay.

18:16.361 --> 18:17.896
We can't be one penny short.
I got it.

18:17.963 --> 18:19.398
Thanks, Chunk.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.501
Bingo.
I found Dimitri Zubakin.

18:22.568 --> 18:25.337
Is this the guy who took
a baseball bat to Bull's car?

18:25.404 --> 18:29.241
Yep. Looks like he moved back
to Russia about five years ago.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.410
Any activity on his passport
since then?

18:31.477 --> 18:33.679
Nope. Looks like
he's stayed put.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.786
(sighs)
Why hasn't he called yet?

18:43.355 --> 18:46.325
He wants his money.
He will call.

18:46.391 --> 18:48.327
BULL:
Wait.

18:48.393 --> 18:49.628
Simon Werth.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.430
His mother brought
him to the clinic

18:51.497 --> 18:55.334
because he was depressed,
and he was getting bullied.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.469
He developed an obsessive
revenge fantasy

18:57.536 --> 19:00.372
against his tormentors.

19:00.439 --> 19:01.406
Did he act on it?

19:01.473 --> 19:04.243
He did, in a way.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.345
He told me that
he bought a knife.

19:06.411 --> 19:07.779
He said he was gonna use it.

19:07.846 --> 19:10.215
So I had to contact
the authorities.

19:10.282 --> 19:12.251
The police went to see him,
he pulled it on them.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.952
No one was hurt but...

19:14.019 --> 19:17.422
he was arrested.
They sent him to jail,

19:17.489 --> 19:18.957
but he could be out by now.

19:19.024 --> 19:22.961
And this is the man that you
think might have Astrid?

19:23.028 --> 19:25.797
No. I'm looking at his
prison records right now.

19:25.864 --> 19:28.667
Simon Werth was found
unresponsive in his cell

19:28.734 --> 19:32.804
during that heat wave
this summer. He's dead.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.253
Um, do you want some coffee?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.688
Hey, why don't,
why don't you take a seat.

19:49.755 --> 19:50.789
I'll make us some coffee
if you want...

19:50.856 --> 19:52.824
No!

19:56.862 --> 19:58.997
Everybody has something to do.

19:59.064 --> 20:00.632
Everyone is trying to find
my daughter.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.501
A-And... (sighs)

20:02.568 --> 20:04.369
I'm so grateful, but just...

20:04.436 --> 20:06.405
I need something to do.
Just please,

20:06.471 --> 20:07.706
let me make the damn coffee.

20:13.011 --> 20:16.782
TAYLOR:
Danny found footage
of the kidnapper's car.

20:16.848 --> 20:19.585
MARISSA:
There's someone
in the driver's seat.

20:19.651 --> 20:21.887
So now we're dealing
with two kidnappers.

20:21.954 --> 20:22.888
Okay, Taylor,
can you...

20:22.955 --> 20:24.456
On it.

20:26.525 --> 20:28.360
(keys clacking)

20:33.365 --> 20:35.834
That SUV was reported stolen
three days ago.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.536
Damn it.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.338
Another dead end.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.373
(phone rings)

20:50.082 --> 20:51.817
Hello.

20:51.883 --> 20:53.885
MAN (distorted):
Do you have the money?

20:53.952 --> 20:55.921
Yes. I have the money.

20:55.988 --> 20:58.523
The million dollars,
just like you asked for.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.292
Tell me where to go.

21:00.359 --> 21:01.793
You'll receive further
instructions

21:01.860 --> 21:03.595
once you're on the road.

21:03.662 --> 21:06.298
Remember, no police.

21:03.662 --> 21:06.298
(line disconnects)

21:10.836 --> 21:12.037
IZZY:
I don't like this.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.672
I don't like you going
out there alone.

21:13.739 --> 21:15.641
BULL:
Danny's following me.
Taylor's

21:15.707 --> 21:17.309
got trackers in my watch,
on my phone...

21:15.707 --> 21:17.309
Danny's one person.

21:17.376 --> 21:19.344
I want an army.
I want helicopters in the sky.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.647
We can't do that.
We don't want to tip them off.

21:21.713 --> 21:22.881
If we panic, they panic.
We stick to the plan.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.083
There is no plan, Jason.

21:25.150 --> 21:27.052
There's no plan.
I went along with this

21:27.119 --> 21:28.754
because I thought your team
would figure out

21:28.820 --> 21:31.456
who took Astrid and have
some kind of special insight

21:31.523 --> 21:33.892
in getting her back. But-but you
don't know who these people are.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.661
You don't know where they are.
You know nothing.

21:35.727 --> 21:38.330
Listen, I don't know who they
are, but we know they did this

21:38.397 --> 21:40.932
to get to me. And I...

21:40.999 --> 21:43.068
I'm the one who has to fix it.

21:43.135 --> 21:46.004
You always say the best
way to win a negotiation

21:46.071 --> 21:47.572
is to never let them see
the fear in your eyes.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.642
Well, I can see the fear
in your eyes, Jason.

21:50.709 --> 21:55.013
And this time, we have
everything to lose.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.550
I got to go.

21:58.617 --> 22:01.586
Please! She's my
daughter, too.

22:01.653 --> 22:02.721
If anything
happens, I'll...

22:01.653 --> 22:02.721
You'll never forgive me.

22:02.788 --> 22:03.922
I know.

22:02.788 --> 22:03.922
...never forgive myself!

22:03.989 --> 22:05.991
For-for not calling the police.

22:06.058 --> 22:09.628
For not just... sc-screaming
and fighting and kicking

22:09.695 --> 22:11.763
and just doing everything
I can to get my daughter back.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.938
I promise you, I'm gonna get
our daughter back.

22:28.647 --> 22:30.048
(sighs)

22:42.794 --> 22:45.731
MAN (distorted):
Take a right at the next light.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.101
Just stay straight
until I tell you.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.503
Do you think they're
sending him to the Bronx?

22:51.570 --> 22:53.905
Could be. Or Queens.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.544
Pull into the storage facility
on your right.

23:00.512 --> 23:02.080
Is this it?

23:04.182 --> 23:06.418
(tires squeal)

23:10.989 --> 23:13.091
(car door opens and closes)

23:13.158 --> 23:16.161
The door is unlocked.
Go down the first hall.

23:19.865 --> 23:21.633
Make a right.

23:24.603 --> 23:27.072
Then a left.

23:28.073 --> 23:33.945
Look for Unit B1073.

23:37.149 --> 23:40.819
Go inside
and close the door behind you.

23:48.026 --> 23:50.595
What is this?
Where's my daughter?

23:50.662 --> 23:51.997
You'll see your daughter

23:52.063 --> 23:54.065
when you've followed
all of my directions.

23:54.132 --> 23:56.568
Now...

23:54.132 --> 23:56.568
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I followed your directions.

23:56.635 --> 23:58.503
Now where is my daughter?

23:58.570 --> 24:00.238
I need to know she's okay.

24:00.305 --> 24:02.040
It's hell

24:02.107 --> 24:04.543
when someone takes your child
from you,

24:04.609 --> 24:06.178
isn't it?

24:07.612 --> 24:10.682
Yes, it is.

24:11.683 --> 24:12.951
(phone ringing)

24:13.018 --> 24:15.053
Answer the other phone.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.622
You'll get
more instructions then.

24:17.689 --> 24:20.492
Okay, wait. Just wait.

24:20.559 --> 24:23.228
(exhales)
Listen. Are you listening to me?

24:23.295 --> 24:25.230
There's a mother.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.733
Think of the mother.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.836
I think he's trying
to establish a connection.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.836
Shh, shh,

24:30.902 --> 24:32.204
shh, shh.

24:33.171 --> 24:35.073
(line disconnects)

24:35.140 --> 24:36.741
(phone continues ringing)

24:36.808 --> 24:38.810
(sighs)

24:42.547 --> 24:43.715
Yes.

24:43.782 --> 24:46.852
MAN (distorted):
Do not say another word.

24:46.918 --> 24:48.954
Transfer the money
to the duffel bag.

24:49.020 --> 24:51.089
Remove all your clothes,

24:51.156 --> 24:53.725
your watch, everything,

24:53.792 --> 24:55.627
and change into the clothes
on the table.

24:55.694 --> 24:58.129
Don't even think
about leaving something on.

24:58.196 --> 25:00.699
I've got eyes on you.

25:05.871 --> 25:08.306
What?
Why can't we hear him anymore?

25:08.373 --> 25:09.908
(keys clacking)

25:08.373 --> 25:09.908
TAYLOR:
There's another phone.

25:09.975 --> 25:11.276
I don't have access to it.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.915
Oh, no. I just lost

25:16.982 --> 25:19.050
Bull's heart rate
from his smartwatch.

25:21.586 --> 25:23.688
I'm going in.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.605
Yeah, Bull's gone.

25:40.672 --> 25:42.307
Well, he must've gone
out the back somehow.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.708
We lost Bull.

25:43.775 --> 25:45.810
I've got no way
to track him now.

25:45.877 --> 25:47.045
I think it might be time
to call the police.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.580
Hold on.

25:48.647 --> 25:50.081
I-I think he was trying
to tell us something.

25:50.148 --> 25:52.350
CHUNK: Bull?

25:50.148 --> 25:52.350
MARISSA:
Yes, I think he was trying

25:52.417 --> 25:53.952
to send us a message.

25:54.019 --> 25:55.320
Uh, rewind the audio

25:55.387 --> 25:57.589
to right before Bull
got off the first phone.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.093
BULL:
Okay, wait. (exhales)

26:02.160 --> 26:03.828
Listen. Are you listening to me?

26:04.829 --> 26:08.133
There's a mother.
Think of the mother.

26:08.199 --> 26:10.302
There, that.
"Think of the mother."

26:10.368 --> 26:12.203
He didn't say
"think of her mother"

26:12.270 --> 26:13.638
or "think
of Astrid's mother."

26:13.705 --> 26:15.674
He said
"think of the mother."

26:15.740 --> 26:18.176
It's a strange way to say that,
don't you think?

26:18.243 --> 26:21.646
The kidnapper said it's hell
when someone takes your child,

26:21.713 --> 26:23.381
as if they know that pain
themselves.

26:23.448 --> 26:26.251
I-I think Bull picked up
on that, wanted us

26:26.318 --> 26:28.219
to pick up on it, too.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.219
CHUNK: You think
this is someone's mother?

26:28.286 --> 26:30.722
It was a man who took Astrid.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.722
MARISSA:
Yes.

26:30.789 --> 26:32.057
But someone drove
the getaway car.

26:32.123 --> 26:33.792
That could have
been a woman.

26:33.858 --> 26:37.162
Bull mentioned a patient's
mother earlier tonight.

26:37.228 --> 26:39.130
The guy who died in prison.

26:39.197 --> 26:40.699
The one who wanted
to get revenge

26:40.765 --> 26:42.267
on his bully. Bull said

26:42.334 --> 26:44.769
that his mother checked him in
for treatment.

26:44.836 --> 26:47.238
This guy. Simon Werth.

26:47.305 --> 26:49.307
I mean, you said he died

26:49.374 --> 26:51.676
just a few months ago.
Maybe that triggered this.

26:51.743 --> 26:52.978
Maybe his mother

26:53.044 --> 26:54.980
blames Bull for the loss
of her child, so she

26:55.046 --> 26:56.915
took his.

26:55.046 --> 26:56.915
You know, that-that fits.

26:56.982 --> 26:59.851
You need to find out everything
that you can about this woman.

26:59.918 --> 27:01.119
So that's it?

27:01.186 --> 27:03.088
We're sticking with no police?

27:03.154 --> 27:05.690
(sighs)

27:05.757 --> 27:07.392
I don't know.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.828
(exhales)

27:16.768 --> 27:19.070
No. No.

27:19.137 --> 27:22.207
Jason said he was the only one
who could fix this,

27:22.273 --> 27:25.043
and he's the one
who figured out who has Astrid.

27:27.012 --> 27:29.147
I believe in him.

27:29.214 --> 27:31.249
No police.

27:32.984 --> 27:35.453
MAN (distorted):
Don't even think
about trying to contact anyone.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.322
Don't worry.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.424
I will do
every single thing you ask.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.093
This is your show.
You are in control.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.396
Whatever you want.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.396
Stop trying to manipulate me

27:44.462 --> 27:46.131
with your psychological crap.

27:46.197 --> 27:49.434
Just shut up and drive.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.704
Sheryl Werth's entire
social media presence is like

27:52.771 --> 27:54.806
a shrine to Simon, and
ever since his death,

27:54.873 --> 27:56.474
it's gotten
increasingly bitter.

27:56.541 --> 27:58.410
Any idea who
the second kidnapper could be?

27:58.476 --> 28:00.311
TAYLOR:
Hang on a second. Well,

28:00.378 --> 28:03.181
she's got another
son named Tristan.

28:03.248 --> 28:04.749
And he matches
the physical profile

28:04.816 --> 28:06.284
of the delivery guy.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.952
TAYLOR:
And it looks
like he's been unemployed

28:08.019 --> 28:08.953
for several months
since the distribution warehouse

28:09.020 --> 28:10.121
where he worked shut down.

28:10.188 --> 28:11.823
Could be desperate
for money.

28:11.890 --> 28:14.025
Well, any idea
where they're keeping my baby?

28:14.092 --> 28:17.762
Uh, maybe one
of their homes?

28:17.829 --> 28:21.266
They live together, actually,
in Meyer Garden Apartments.

28:21.332 --> 28:23.168
It's eight towers of
12-story buildings

28:23.234 --> 28:24.335
in the Bronx.

28:23.234 --> 28:24.335
That's a huge complex.
I don't think

28:24.402 --> 28:25.804
that they'd bring Astrid there.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.338
Too many eyeballs.
Too big a risk.

28:27.405 --> 28:29.040
And it's clear across
town from that storage facility.

28:29.107 --> 28:31.409
Well, keep digging.
You have to find something.

28:34.813 --> 28:36.881
(keys clacking)

28:46.958 --> 28:47.926
(shuts off engine)

28:47.992 --> 28:50.028
(sirens wailing in distance)

28:53.798 --> 28:55.533
(car door closes)

28:55.600 --> 28:57.836
(dog barking in distance)

29:02.407 --> 29:05.043
(water dripping)

29:05.110 --> 29:06.878
Hello?

29:08.113 --> 29:10.815
WOMAN:
Stop right there.

29:12.150 --> 29:13.418
MAN:
Give me the cash.

29:14.886 --> 29:17.021
Not until I see my daughter.
Where is she?

29:17.088 --> 29:20.191
You'll get your kid back once
we know the money's all here.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.826
It's all there.

29:21.893 --> 29:23.161
You want me to
count it for you?

29:21.893 --> 29:23.161
He knows

29:23.228 --> 29:25.096
how to count!

29:27.832 --> 29:29.868
(keys clacking)

29:30.969 --> 29:33.571
Damn it.
(sighs)

29:33.638 --> 29:35.507
You okay?

29:35.573 --> 29:37.275
(crying):
No.

29:37.342 --> 29:40.178
I have no idea where the Werths
are keeping Astrid.

29:40.245 --> 29:42.147
There's no credit card charges
at a motel.

29:42.213 --> 29:44.482
I've tried to ping their phones,
but they're both turned off.

29:44.549 --> 29:46.451
It's one dead end
after another,

29:46.518 --> 29:48.853
just like that stolen SUV.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.853
Hey, you'll find something.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.455
You always do.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.455
What if I don't?

29:50.522 --> 29:53.892
There's-there's no time,
and I keep running into walls.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.861
And-and I just... I-I feel
like I can't think straight,

29:56.928 --> 29:58.596
and I'm paralyzed.

29:56.928 --> 29:58.596
Hey. Hey. Hey.

29:58.663 --> 30:01.399
And I just keep thinking
about that poor little girl.

29:58.663 --> 30:01.399
Okay.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.034
Maybe terrified.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.034
Stop.

30:03.101 --> 30:06.137
Or maybe hurt. Maybe...

30:06.204 --> 30:07.939
(sighs)

30:08.006 --> 30:11.776
You need to take a break.

30:08.006 --> 30:11.776
What? No, I can't take a break.

30:12.944 --> 30:14.212
Not while Astrid's
still missing.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.114
Bull, too.
I need to find them.

30:16.181 --> 30:18.483
You need to take a minute.

30:18.550 --> 30:21.019
You're no good to them
the way you are right now.

30:21.085 --> 30:22.520
I can feel the panic
coursing through your veins.

30:21.085 --> 30:22.520
(inhales deeply)

30:29.661 --> 30:32.163
(sighs)

30:33.331 --> 30:37.068
MAURICIO:
I'm going to see the sharks
first, then the giant turtles.

30:37.135 --> 30:39.037
You and Daddy
are gonna have so much fun

30:39.103 --> 30:40.471
at the aquarium today.

30:40.538 --> 30:42.340
Will you count
how many fish you see

30:42.407 --> 30:44.075
and then tell me tonight?

30:44.142 --> 30:45.043
Count the fish?

30:45.109 --> 30:47.879
Mommy, there's too many.

30:47.946 --> 30:49.480
Are you still there?

30:49.547 --> 30:51.149
I have to go, sweetheart.

30:51.216 --> 30:53.051
But I love you so much.
You know that, right?

30:53.117 --> 30:54.385
Love you, too.

30:54.452 --> 30:56.387
(Astrid sobbing)

30:56.454 --> 30:58.189
Hey.

30:58.256 --> 31:01.092
Hey. Sweetie.

31:01.159 --> 31:03.294
Hi, baby. Hey.

31:03.361 --> 31:06.197
How are you?
It's Daddy. You're okay.

31:06.264 --> 31:08.499
Lookit. Hi.

31:08.566 --> 31:09.601
Hey,

31:09.667 --> 31:10.668
it's okay.

31:10.735 --> 31:13.171
Hi, sweetie. Thank you.

31:13.238 --> 31:14.572
Give me the car keys.

31:14.639 --> 31:18.076
It's okay. It's okay.
Here you go.

31:18.142 --> 31:20.378
We're taking both cars.
You need to wait here

31:20.445 --> 31:21.512
for at least an hour
before you leave.

31:21.579 --> 31:22.914
I understand.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.216
Come on.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.921
(exhales deeply)

31:32.190 --> 31:34.592
C-Come on. Let's go.

31:40.565 --> 31:41.699
What are you doing?

31:40.565 --> 31:41.699
I bet

31:41.766 --> 31:43.701
you don't even remember
who I am.

31:43.768 --> 31:46.471
What you did to my family.

31:46.537 --> 31:49.040
I know who you are.

31:50.541 --> 31:52.477
You brought
your son Simon to me.

31:52.543 --> 31:54.979
And he was hurting,

31:55.046 --> 31:57.048
and I wanted to help him.

31:57.115 --> 31:59.484
And I tried to reach him.
I really did.

31:59.550 --> 32:01.419
But I failed.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.621
I know I failed.

32:03.688 --> 32:05.556
And he's dead.

32:07.992 --> 32:10.628
And I'm very sorry.

32:10.695 --> 32:13.131
Yeah,
we'll see how sorry you are

32:13.197 --> 32:16.200
when you lose your child.

32:16.267 --> 32:17.602
(Astrid sobs)

32:16.267 --> 32:17.602
(Bull sighs)

32:22.640 --> 32:24.575
Please don't hurt her.
Do anything you want with me,

32:24.642 --> 32:26.444
but look at her.
She's just a little...

32:24.642 --> 32:26.444
Mom. Mom.

32:26.511 --> 32:28.680
(breathing shakily):
Don't do this.

32:28.746 --> 32:30.648
We said no one
would get hurt.

32:30.715 --> 32:32.617
(crying):
I'm sorry, Tristan.

32:32.684 --> 32:35.620
I thought the money
would be enough.

32:35.687 --> 32:38.489
But it's not.

32:38.556 --> 32:40.458
Just go. Go! Now.

32:40.525 --> 32:42.593
Get out of here!

32:42.660 --> 32:44.295
Go now!

32:44.362 --> 32:46.197
BULL:
Let Tristan take her.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.232
I know you want to
avenge your son's death,

32:48.299 --> 32:50.335
but killing a little girl

32:50.401 --> 32:52.503
is not gonna
bring Simon back.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.440
You don't want to do that.

32:55.506 --> 32:57.475
You don't know what I want.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.510
BULL:
You want what's
best for Tristan.

32:59.577 --> 33:01.579
And if you harm
this little girl,

33:01.646 --> 33:04.549
his life is over, and I
know you don't want that.

33:04.615 --> 33:08.019
So let him take her, okay?

33:08.086 --> 33:09.354
He's got the money.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.189
He can have a life.

33:11.255 --> 33:14.158
A life that
Simon never got.

33:11.255 --> 33:14.158
No, Mom, don't do this.

33:14.225 --> 33:15.593
Just come with me.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.595
(Astrid crying)

33:19.230 --> 33:21.766
Just go and take the girl.
Just get out of here.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.102
Just go now. Just go.

33:24.168 --> 33:27.171
TRISTAN:
Mom, I can't do this alone.

33:24.168 --> 33:27.171
Go now!

33:27.238 --> 33:28.773
TRISTAN:
I can't do this alone.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.441
BULL:
Yes, you can.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.343
Look at me. Look at me.

33:32.410 --> 33:35.213
You can do it. Come
on. Here she comes.

33:32.410 --> 33:35.213
(Astrid sobbing)

33:35.279 --> 33:38.383
There you go. Take her
to a fire station.

33:38.449 --> 33:40.585
Look at me. You take
her to a fire station,

33:40.651 --> 33:43.521
and you leave a note
for Isabella Colón.

33:43.588 --> 33:45.390
Okay? You can do this.

33:45.456 --> 33:47.225
I saw you give her the bunny.
You don't want to hurt her.

33:47.291 --> 33:51.062
Okay? Go. Go.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.812
Yes!

34:05.543 --> 34:07.812
What is it?

34:07.879 --> 34:10.348
Danny, I think I've got
a possible location.

34:10.415 --> 34:11.749
Where?

34:10.415 --> 34:11.749
TAYLOR:
I'm texting you an address.

34:11.816 --> 34:14.619
It's north of where
you are. Just about

34:14.685 --> 34:16.220
four minutes away.

34:14.685 --> 34:16.220
I'm on my way.

34:16.287 --> 34:18.322
(tires squealing)

34:21.893 --> 34:24.429
How'd you get that?

34:21.893 --> 34:24.429
(sighs)

34:24.495 --> 34:26.297
A few years ago,
my brother-in-law

34:26.364 --> 34:28.266
was worried his car
was gonna get repossessed,

34:28.332 --> 34:30.735
so he started parking it
at his buddy's house.

34:30.802 --> 34:33.237
But the repo company
found it anyway.

34:33.304 --> 34:36.574
They have these camera cars
constantly trolling the city,

34:36.641 --> 34:39.243
taking pictures of plates
that go into a database.

34:39.310 --> 34:40.645
And you hacked it?

34:39.310 --> 34:40.645
Yeah.

34:40.711 --> 34:43.147
And that gray SUV
was photographed twice

34:43.214 --> 34:45.650
since it was stolen, both times
right in front of the warehouse

34:45.716 --> 34:47.852
where Tristan Werth
used to work.

34:47.919 --> 34:49.687
Good job.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.722
Thanks.

34:51.789 --> 34:53.624
You're welcome.

34:53.691 --> 34:55.426
(sighs)

34:58.429 --> 35:00.598
I know you're a good person.

35:00.665 --> 35:02.633
When I was working
with Simon,

35:02.700 --> 35:04.869
I saw how much he loved you

35:04.936 --> 35:07.405
and how much you loved him and
how much you wanted to help him.

35:07.472 --> 35:09.340
You don't really want
to hurt anybody.

35:07.472 --> 35:09.340
Shut up. Just shut up!

35:09.407 --> 35:10.808
Shut up

35:10.875 --> 35:12.743
and turn around.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.579
Okay.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.583
And get down on your knees.

35:26.457 --> 35:29.227
Simon was a good person.

35:29.293 --> 35:31.729
You should've
let me handle it.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.665
You didn't have to call
the police.

35:36.267 --> 35:38.369
(phone ringing)

35:46.377 --> 35:47.879
Hello?

35:47.945 --> 35:49.547
MAN:
Is this Isabella Colón?

35:49.614 --> 35:51.148
Yes. Yes.

35:51.949 --> 35:54.452
We have your daughter
at our fire station.

35:54.519 --> 35:56.621
Someone left her outside
with a note.

35:56.687 --> 36:00.258
(crying):
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.726
(sniffles)
It's a fireman.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.828
He has Astrid. She's safe.

36:06.964 --> 36:08.866
And-and-and
what about my husband?

36:08.933 --> 36:10.868
Do you know anything
about my husband?

36:14.872 --> 36:16.307
(engine shuts off)

36:22.880 --> 36:24.582
Taylor, I'm at the warehouse,

36:24.649 --> 36:26.317
but I don't see
a gray SUV anywhere.

36:26.384 --> 36:27.718
Just a blue sedan.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.722
He's here.

36:37.261 --> 36:39.330
(Sheryl breathing shakily)

36:41.632 --> 36:43.568
(whispers):
This is for Simon.

36:43.634 --> 36:46.470
You know what I remember
about Simon?

36:47.471 --> 36:49.574
He told me

36:49.640 --> 36:51.475
you took him
to an amusement park

36:51.542 --> 36:52.944
for his 12th birthday.

36:53.010 --> 36:55.580
Right? It was his 12th birthday.

36:55.646 --> 36:57.949
And he knew you were
afraid of heights,

36:58.015 --> 37:00.017
but he said that
you took him

37:00.084 --> 37:02.720
on this massive roller coaster
anyway.

37:02.787 --> 37:05.823
And he knew how scared you were.

37:08.526 --> 37:12.296
And he thought that was so cool
that you would...

37:12.363 --> 37:15.266
face your fears like that.

37:15.333 --> 37:17.668
For him.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.842
What was that book

37:24.909 --> 37:27.812
that you read him every night?
He talked about it.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.018
(sighs)
I can't remember the title.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.853
I'm sure you remember.

37:39.624 --> 37:41.692
The Church Mice.

37:39.624 --> 37:41.692
(exhales)

37:41.759 --> 37:43.527
The Church Mice.

37:44.495 --> 37:47.498
That was his favorite
book. And he loved

37:47.565 --> 37:48.866
that book,

37:48.933 --> 37:52.637
and he loved
that you read him that book

37:52.703 --> 37:54.338
every...

37:54.405 --> 37:55.606
Drop your weapon!
Hands in the air!

37:54.405 --> 37:55.606
No! No, stop it!

37:55.673 --> 37:57.541
I said drop!

37:55.673 --> 37:57.541
Don't shoot, Danny!

37:57.608 --> 37:59.010
I said drop your weapon.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.010
BULL:
Don't shoot! I've got this.

37:59.076 --> 37:59.977
Don't shoot!

37:59.076 --> 37:59.977
SHERYL:
Stay back! Stay back!

38:00.044 --> 38:01.579
Everything's gonna be okay.

38:01.646 --> 38:03.581
(whispering):
Everything's gonna be all right.

38:03.648 --> 38:05.883
Everything's gonna
be all right.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.718
Please.

38:09.053 --> 38:10.621
(panting)

38:10.688 --> 38:12.089
(normal voice):
You know what happened

38:12.156 --> 38:13.658
right before I got here?

38:13.724 --> 38:16.494
My wife told me
that she'd never forgive herself

38:16.560 --> 38:19.730
if she didn't do
every single thing she could

38:19.797 --> 38:21.365
to save our daughter.

38:21.432 --> 38:24.001
And that's all you're doing
right now.

38:24.068 --> 38:26.003
That's it.

38:27.004 --> 38:29.674
You want to do
every single thing you can

38:29.740 --> 38:31.809
to avenge Simon.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.845
But you don't have to.

38:36.013 --> 38:39.083
He knew how much you loved him.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.053
No matter how much
he was hurting,

38:42.119 --> 38:44.522
he knew.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.692
You don't...

38:47.758 --> 38:50.327
you don't have
anything left to prove.

38:51.896 --> 38:53.898
(exhales)

38:58.703 --> 39:00.838
(Sheryl sobbing)

39:02.506 --> 39:06.410
Oh, no, God!

39:08.646 --> 39:11.882
No! No!

39:11.949 --> 39:14.752
(sirens wailing)

39:14.819 --> 39:16.420
It's okay.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.423
(indistinct chatter over radio)

39:23.427 --> 39:24.862
(siren chirps)

39:24.929 --> 39:26.163
(Bull sighs)

39:26.230 --> 39:28.799
STALLARD:
Hey, Bull. You okay?

39:28.866 --> 39:32.603
Hey. Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.

39:32.670 --> 39:35.439
Uh... Did you get
everything you need?

39:35.506 --> 39:36.707
I'm sure I'll have
more questions

39:36.774 --> 39:38.109
later for you and your wife.

39:38.175 --> 39:40.344
I'll be in touch.
