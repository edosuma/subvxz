WEBVTT

00:11.767 --> 00:12.833
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:12.867 --> 00:15.233
(Izzie) I HAD SEX LAST NIGHT
WITH THE WRONG PERSON.

00:15.267 --> 00:17.833
BUT THE THING IS,
IT DIDN'T FEEL WRONG.
THIS IS OUR SECRET, OKAY?

00:17.867 --> 00:19.667
WE HEARD ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.267
WE'RE HERE TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.733
WHAT IF MY HUSBAND SHOWS UP
TOMORROW WITH A PICTURE

00:23.767 --> 00:25.500
OF WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO
LOOK LIKE, BUT IT'S TOO LATE,

00:25.533 --> 00:28.500
AND I'M STUCK WITH THE WRONG
FACE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE?
CRISTINA AND I WERE TOGETHER

00:28.533 --> 00:29.533
FOR THREE YEARS.

00:29.567 --> 00:31.533
ARE YOU GONNA INVITE ME?
WHERE?

00:31.567 --> 00:35.433
TO THE WEDDING.
PLEASE LEAVE.

00:35.467 --> 00:36.800
(Meredith) A PATIENT'S HISTORY

00:36.833 --> 00:39.667
IS AS IMPORTANT
AS THEIR SYMPTOMS.

00:39.700 --> 00:44.100
IT'S WHAT HELPS US DECIDE
IF HEARTBURN'S A HEART ATTACK,

00:44.133 --> 00:46.067
IF A HEADACHE'S A TUMOR.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.800
***

00:47.833 --> 00:50.667
SOMETIMES PATIENTS WILL TRY
TO REWRITE THEIR OWN HISTORIES.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.367
THEY'LL CLAIM THEY DON'T SMOKE

00:52.400 --> 00:55.400
OR FORGET TO MENTION
CERTAIN DRUGS,

00:55.433 --> 00:59.400
WHICH, IN SURGERY,
CAN BE THE KISS OF DEATH.

00:59.433 --> 01:01.300
(monitor beeping erratically)

01:01.333 --> 01:04.267
***

01:07.133 --> 01:09.700
BUT OUR HISTORY...

01:09.733 --> 01:14.100
EVENTUALLY ALWAYS COMES BACK
TO HAUNT US.

01:14.133 --> 01:17.333
***

01:17.367 --> 01:19.267
MEREDITH--SHE'LL ACCEPT
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HELP,

01:19.300 --> 01:21.200
AND THEN SHE STARTS
TO FEEL SUFFOCATED.

01:21.233 --> 01:24.200
OH. IS THIS--
AM I SUFFOCATING?

01:24.233 --> 01:26.133
NO. THE GROCERIES
ARE JUST RIGHT.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.400
IT'S--IT'S ME.
I SOMETIMES OVERDO IT.

01:28.433 --> 01:30.333
WELL, WHO COULD BLAME YOU
WITH EVERYTHING?

01:30.367 --> 01:31.733
AFTER ELLIS DIED,

01:31.767 --> 01:33.700
I GAVE HER SOME TIME,
BUT I WANT TO BE HERE.

01:33.733 --> 01:35.767
I WANT TO HELP
MAKE THINGS EASIER.
GOOD. YEAH.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.133
I JUST TRY TO KEEP IT LIGHT.
YOU KNOW, BE HELPFUL...

01:38.167 --> 01:39.533
GOOD MORNING.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.500
GOOD MORNING.
WANT SOME COFFEE?

01:41.533 --> 01:43.433
YES. THIS ALL YOU?

01:43.467 --> 01:46.400
I JUST PICKED UP SOME THINGS
TO RESTOCK YOUR FRIDGE.

01:46.433 --> 01:49.167
WELL, YOU BOUGHT GROCERIES
LAST WEEK.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.067
YEAH, YOU HAVE TO GET IT
EVERY WEEK IF YOU WANT MORE.

01:52.067 --> 01:53.533
(chuckles)
WELL, THANK YOU.

01:53.567 --> 01:56.800
IT'S UNEXPECTED, AND YOU
DIDN'T NEED TO DO ALL THIS.
AH.

01:56.833 --> 01:59.333
MMM. IS THIS FOR EVERYBODY?
ABSOLUTELY.

01:59.367 --> 02:01.267
I GOTTA RUN.
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO RICHARD

02:01.300 --> 02:03.200
BEFORE THINGS GET TOO BUSY
IN THE HOSPITAL.

02:03.233 --> 02:05.533
SEE YA.
MM. ARE YOU GONNA TALK
TO HIM ABOUT THE, UH--

02:05.567 --> 02:08.767
YEAH. WISH ME LUCK.
YOU DON'T NEED IT.
JUST MAKE HIM LISTEN TO YOU.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.600
YOU DESERVE TO BE CHIEF.

02:11.633 --> 02:14.167
(elevator bell dings)

02:16.100 --> 02:18.833
NICE SWEATER.

02:18.867 --> 02:21.167
UH... MY WIFE.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.533
WHAT?

02:22.567 --> 02:24.300
MY WIFE,
SHE GAVE IT TO ME.

02:24.333 --> 02:26.367
THE SWEATER.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.367
ACTUALLY,
IT'S MY EX-WIFE.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.067
IT'S AMICABLE.
I'M SORRY?

02:32.100 --> 02:33.267
THE DIVORCE,
IT'S--IT'S AMICABLE,

02:33.300 --> 02:36.067
VERY FRIENDLY.

02:36.067 --> 02:39.500
I'M A FRIENDLY GUY.
(chuckles)

02:39.533 --> 02:41.467
(bell dings)

02:44.633 --> 02:46.133
"I'M A FRIENDLY GUY"?

02:46.167 --> 02:47.500
SLOAN.

02:47.533 --> 02:49.433
SHE PRESSED FIVE
AND GOT OFF AT THREE.

02:49.467 --> 02:51.367
SHE'D RATHER WALK UP
TWO FLIGHTS OF STAIRS

02:51.400 --> 02:52.733
THAN FLIRT WITH YOU.

02:52.767 --> 02:55.633
HELL, SHE'D RATHER CLIMB UP
THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING.

02:55.667 --> 02:57.600
I WASN'T FLIRTING.
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

02:59.733 --> 03:01.633
THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE EMBARRASSED.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.533
TIME FOR YOU
TO SHAKE OFF THE RUST

03:03.567 --> 03:06.467
AND GET BACK IN THE GAME.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.667
YOU NEED A WINGMAN.

03:07.700 --> 03:09.367
I HAVE PATIENTS TO SEE.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.600
WE'D MAKE A GREAT TEAM.

03:11.633 --> 03:14.467
NOTHING LIKE A QUICK
VENTRICULAR RECONSTRUCTION

03:14.500 --> 03:15.833
TO JUMPSTART
YOUR MORNING, EH?

03:15.867 --> 03:17.767
OKAY, YOU'RE OFFICIALLY
BECOMING CREEPY,

03:17.800 --> 03:19.300
CREEPY AND... STALKING.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.600
BURKE AND I
HAVE SET OUR DATE.

03:21.633 --> 03:24.100
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
NEXT MONTH.
WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE NOT
THE MARRYING KIND.

03:24.133 --> 03:26.067
WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
YOU DON'T KNOW ME ANYMORE.

03:26.067 --> 03:27.467
WELL, JUST TO BE SURE

03:27.500 --> 03:29.400
YOU'RE FULLY AWARE
OF WHAT YOU'RE PASSING UP,

03:29.433 --> 03:31.333
I'D LIKE YOU TO ASSIST ME

03:31.367 --> 03:33.500
ON MY HETEROTOPIC
HEART TRANSPLANT TODAY.

03:33.533 --> 03:36.100
WHAT, A PIGGYBACK TRANSPLANT?
SERIOUSLY?

03:36.133 --> 03:38.467
BURKE WILL WANT
TO SCRUB IN, TOO, I IMAGINE,

03:38.500 --> 03:40.767
SEE HOW IT'S DONE.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.733
***

03:41.767 --> 03:44.767
HETEROTOPIC TRANSPLANT.
HE IS UPPING HIS GAME.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.133
I NEED A GAMBIT.

03:46.167 --> 03:48.733
I NEED TO FORCE HIM
INTO THE DEFENSIVE.

03:48.767 --> 03:50.767
TAKE HIS QUEEN.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.767
YOU'VE NEVER PLAYED CHESS?
I'M NOT A GEEK.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.500
I'VE GOTTA CRUSH HIM.

03:54.533 --> 03:56.567
I'VE GOTTA ANNIHILATE HIM
AT HIS OWN GAME.
SO IT'S WEIRD, RIGHT,

03:56.600 --> 03:58.500
THAT SUSAN KEEPS STOPPING BY
LIKE THIS?

03:58.533 --> 04:00.433
I MEAN, WE JUST BECAME FRIENDS
OR SEMI-RELATED

04:00.467 --> 04:03.133
OR WHATEVER YOU CALL
YOUR ESTRANGED FATHER'S WIFE.

04:03.167 --> 04:05.167
YOU MAY BE CONFUSED SINCE YOU
WERE BASICALLY RAISED BY WOLVES,

04:05.200 --> 04:06.300
BUT THIS IS WHAT MOTHER'S DO.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.867
THEY STOP BY,
THEY STOCK THE FRIDGE.

04:07.900 --> 04:11.667
HEY, DUDE, YOU THINK
SHE MIGHT DO OUR LAUNDRY?
HEY, GET YOUR OWN FAKE MOM.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.567
HEY.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.733
BAD NIGHT ON CALL?
OH, GOD.

04:15.767 --> 04:17.700
YEAH, WHEN MY PATIENT'S
GOOEY ABSCESS

04:17.733 --> 04:19.833
EXPLODED ALL OVER ME
AT 4:00 A.M.,

04:19.867 --> 04:22.500
THAT WAS A HIGHLIGHT.
HOLY MARY, MOTHER OF GOD,

04:22.533 --> 04:24.733
PRAY FOR US SINNERS NOW
AND AT THE...

04:24.767 --> 04:26.267
(whistles) IZ, YOU LOOK NICE.
(mutters)

04:26.300 --> 04:29.500
DID YOU JUST COME FROM
CONFESSION IN A CHURCH?

04:29.533 --> 04:31.067
SHUT UP.

04:31.100 --> 04:35.300
IZZIE STEVENS DOES PENANCE.
YOU DID SOMETHING BAD.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.600
OH. I FEEL LIKE POO.

04:37.633 --> 04:39.700
I JUST HOPE I CAN MAKE IT
THROUGH THE DAY

04:39.733 --> 04:42.467
WITHOUT FALLING ASLEEP.
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE
A COFFEE DATE?

04:42.500 --> 04:44.400
3:00 P.M. YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE PICK-ME-UP.

04:44.433 --> 04:46.200
YEAH. THAT SOUNDS NICE,
REALLY NICE.

04:46.233 --> 04:47.833
GOOD.

04:47.867 --> 04:49.400
OKAY.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.400
SMILE.

04:55.433 --> 04:57.333
OH, COME ON, MAN.
THAT'S NOT A SMILE.

04:57.367 --> 04:59.067
CAN I SEE?

04:59.067 --> 05:01.300
THAT'S ME?

05:01.333 --> 05:03.100
OH, MY GOD.

05:03.133 --> 05:05.133
(laughs) I KNOW
THIS IS GONNA SOUND TERRIBLE,

05:05.167 --> 05:07.067
BUT I'M NOT BAD-LOOKING.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.100
I THINK BEAUTIFUL
IS THE WORD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

05:09.133 --> 05:10.733
I WAS GONNA SAY HOT.

05:10.767 --> 05:13.333
I WAS, TOO, BUT I THINK
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN IN TROUBLE.
YOU WOULD'VE.

05:13.367 --> 05:14.333
STILL A LITTLE SWELLING.

05:14.367 --> 05:16.500
IN A DAY OR TWO, I'LL RAISE
THAT HOT TO SMOKIN'.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.633
THEN SHOULDN'T WE WAIT
TO TAKE THE "AFTER" PICTURES?

05:18.667 --> 05:21.267
WE COULD,
BUT THE SOONER WE TAKE THEM,

05:21.300 --> 05:24.133
THE SOONER
WE GET THEM OUT THERE.
YOUR PICTURE'S
GONNA BE EVERYWHERE--

05:24.167 --> 05:26.567
THE POLICE, THE NEWS,
THE INTERNET.
BUT IF MY FACE
LOOKS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT,

05:26.600 --> 05:29.800
THEN WHAT GOOD
WOULD PICTURES DO?
I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN
ASPECTS OF YOUR BONE STRUCTURE,

05:29.833 --> 05:32.233
SO YOUR FACE BEARS SOME
SIMILARITIES TO YOUR OLD FACE,

05:32.267 --> 05:34.167
PLUS, YOUR--YOUR HAIR
AND YOUR EYES ARE THE SAME.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.533
YOU THINK--DO YOU REALLY THINK
SOMEONE MIGHT RECOGNIZE ME?

05:37.567 --> 05:40.700
I THINK YOU SHOULD SMILE.

05:40.733 --> 05:42.633
I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS CONFESSION THING,

05:42.667 --> 05:44.500
IT--IT REALLY WORKS.

05:44.533 --> 05:47.467
IT'S LIKE WE HAVE A DO OVER.
OUR SIN IS GONE.

05:47.500 --> 05:50.100
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP
AVOIDING ME.
YEAH, I DO.

05:50.133 --> 05:52.067
UNTIL THIS THING
BLOWS OVER, I DO.

05:52.067 --> 05:53.500
JAVIER RUGGERO?

05:53.533 --> 05:55.833
JAVIER, UH, RUGGERO?

05:55.867 --> 05:57.633
BLOWS OVER?

05:57.667 --> 05:59.567
WHAT DOES THAT
EVEN MEAN?

05:59.600 --> 06:01.067
WHEN MEREDITH AND I, UH...

06:01.100 --> 06:04.100
EVENTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
IT BLEW OVER. IT PASSED.
YOU MEAN THE SAD SEX?

06:04.133 --> 06:06.267
THE SAD, TRAGIC,
DEPRESSION-INDUCING SEX

06:06.300 --> 06:09.167
YOU HAD WITH MEREDITH
IS THE SAME AS WHAT--
I CAN'T.

06:09.200 --> 06:12.433
OKAY? BACK OFF.
JUST FOR NOW, BACK OFF.

06:12.467 --> 06:16.233
JAVIER... RUGGERO?

06:16.267 --> 06:18.333
(man)
YOU'RE DR. ISOBEL STEVENS?

06:18.367 --> 06:19.633
YES.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.567
UH, IF YOU'RE MR. RUGGERO,
THOUGH,

06:21.600 --> 06:23.233
YOU'RE WITH DR. O'MALLEY.

06:23.267 --> 06:24.600
UH, DR. STEVENS--

06:24.633 --> 06:26.533
WE, UH... OUR D--OUR DAUGHTER
HAS LEUKEMIA

06:26.567 --> 06:29.267
AND NEEDS
A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.067
YOU, UH, YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR HEMATOLOGY.

06:31.067 --> 06:32.800
IT'S THIRD FLOOR WEST--
THROUGH THESE DOUBLE DOORS,

06:32.833 --> 06:36.167
SECOND SET OF ELEVATORS
ON THE... ON THE RIGHT.

06:37.633 --> 06:40.233
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.167
BUT SEATTLE GRACE
HAS ONE OF THE BEST

06:42.200 --> 06:43.700
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT CENTERS
IN THE COUNTRY.

06:43.733 --> 06:46.667
IF YOU'D LIKE, I CAN
TAKE YOU UP THERE MYSELF.
NO, NO, IT'S JUST THAT...

06:46.700 --> 06:50.067
YOU LOOK SO MUCH LIKE
OUR DAUGHTER.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.833
WE'RE DUSTIN
AND CAROLINE KLEIN.

06:51.867 --> 06:55.233
WE'RE HANNAH'S PARENTS.

06:55.267 --> 06:57.400
WE'RE HER...

06:57.433 --> 07:00.100
WE'RE
YOUR DAUGHTER'S PARENTS.

07:00.133 --> 07:07.133
YOU'RE HANNAH'S BIRTH MOTHER.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.100
HANNAH WAS DIAGNOSED
A FEW MONTHS AGO

07:10.133 --> 07:11.567
WITH ACUTE
MYELOID LEUKEMIA.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.500
WE, UH, WE LOOKED YOU UP,

07:13.533 --> 07:15.433
AND WE KNOW THAT
THAT'S WRONG, BUT--

07:15.467 --> 07:17.333
SHE NEEDS THE TRANSPLANT.
WE--WE WERE SET TO GO.

07:17.367 --> 07:19.600
WE HAD A DONOR.
YEAH, HER DONOR DIED.

07:19.633 --> 07:22.067
THE REGISTRY CALLED
HANNAH'S ONCOLOGIST LAST NIGHT.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.067
'CAUSE APPARENTLY HANNAH HASN'T
HAD ENOUGH BAD LUCK.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.200
AND WE'D NEVER ASK.

07:25.233 --> 07:28.567
I MEAN, WE HAD NO INTENTION
OF BOTHERING YOU, EVER.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.767
BUT LAST NIGHT,
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.833
NO. OF COURSE.
OF COURSE I'D DONATE.

07:32.867 --> 07:34.833
IT'S JUST...

07:34.867 --> 07:37.700
A BIOLOGICAL PARENT
ISN'T USUALLY A GOOD DONOR.

07:37.733 --> 07:39.367
I'M ONLY A HALF MATCH.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.167
HANNAH WOULD PROBABLY
DO BETTER

07:41.200 --> 07:44.267
GETTING BACK ON THE DONOR LIST
AND WAITING.

07:44.300 --> 07:47.100
I KNOW...

07:47.133 --> 07:49.133
WHEN YOU GAVE HER UP,

07:49.167 --> 07:51.167
WE PROMISED
TO TAKE CARE OF HER,

07:51.200 --> 07:53.467
TO KEEP HER SAFE,

07:53.500 --> 07:55.633
BUT I-I CAN'T PROTECT HER
FROM THIS.

07:55.667 --> 07:57.800
IT'S GENETIC.

07:57.833 --> 07:59.733
YOU HAVE TO
TAKE CARE OF HER.

07:59.767 --> 08:01.633
(Dustin) EVERY DAY WE WAIT,
SHE GETS SICKER.

08:01.667 --> 08:03.500
AND--AND IF WE'RE LUCKY,

08:03.533 --> 08:06.467
YOU--YOU COULD BE BETTER
THAN A HALF MATCH.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.767
YEAH.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.367
IS SHE...

08:11.400 --> 08:13.067
SHE'S HERE?

08:14.533 --> 08:17.433
GOD, SHE MUST BE SCARED.

08:17.467 --> 08:19.633
SHE'S UPSTAIRS
WITH MY MOTHER.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.233
CAN I...

08:22.267 --> 08:24.400
UM...

08:24.433 --> 08:27.533
I'D--I'D LIKE TO MEET HER.

08:27.567 --> 08:29.467
WE--WE'D HAVE TO
CHECK WITH HANNAH.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.800
BUT I-IF SHE AGREES,

08:31.833 --> 08:34.067
OF COURSE WE'D BE
OKAY WITH IT.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.533
ISOBEL...

08:39.567 --> 08:42.333
OUR DAUGHTER COULD DIE.

08:44.833 --> 08:46.667
CHARLES...

08:46.700 --> 08:48.367
THIS IS DR. BURKE.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.600
I'VE INVITED HIM TO ASSIST
ON THE SURGERY.

08:50.633 --> 08:53.767
HOW DO YOU DO, DR. BURKE?
OH, YOU'RE PLAYING YOURSELF?

08:53.800 --> 08:56.667
IT DISTRACTS ME FROM THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

08:56.700 --> 08:59.167
YOUR HANDS IN MY CHEST
IN A FEW HOURS.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.233
AND THIS, CHARLES, IS
A FORMER STUDENT OF MINE--

09:01.267 --> 09:03.467
A FORMIDABLE CHESS PLAYER
HERSELF--DR. CRISTINA YANG.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.400
SOON TO BE
DR. CRISTINA BURKE.

09:05.433 --> 09:07.300
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
NEXT MONTH.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.400
(Charles) CONGRATULATIONS.

09:09.433 --> 09:11.400
THANK YOU, SIR.

09:11.433 --> 09:14.433
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN...
THE PROCEDURE, DR. YANG.

09:14.467 --> 09:15.533
ABSOLUTELY.

09:15.567 --> 09:17.233
MR. REDFORD,

09:17.267 --> 09:19.067
INSTEAD OF REPLACING
YOUR CURRENT HEART,

09:19.100 --> 09:21.633
WE'RE GOING TO ATTACH IT
TO THE NEW HEART,

09:21.667 --> 09:23.067
ESSENTIALLY PIGGYBACKING IT.

09:23.067 --> 09:25.633
THE TWO HEARTS PUMP TOGETHER,
SHARE THE WORKLOAD.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.100
IT'S, UH...

09:27.133 --> 09:28.567
IT'S A PERFECT TEAM.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.300
MORE ACCURATELY,

09:30.333 --> 09:32.500
THE NEW HEART WILL CIRCULATE
BLOOD TO THE BODY,

09:32.533 --> 09:35.167
WHILE THE NATIVE HEART WILL
PUMP BLOOD TO THE LUNGS.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.100
MORE OF A DIVIDE-AND-CONQUER
APPROACH.

09:37.133 --> 09:38.500
WOULDN'T YOU SAY, DR. YANG?

09:38.533 --> 09:40.300
SOUNDS RISKY?

09:40.333 --> 09:42.100
ALL SURGERIES CARRY
A DEGREE OF RISK,

09:42.133 --> 09:44.167
BUT DR. MARLOWE
PIONEERED THE PROCEDURE.
AND DR. BURKE

09:44.200 --> 09:47.067
IS ONE OF THE FOREMOST
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEONS

09:47.067 --> 09:49.467
IN THE COUNTRY.
WELL, I'LL BE THE ONE
ON POINT, OF COURSE.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.733
SO YOU'VE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

09:51.767 --> 09:53.800
YOU'VE PICKED THE BEST MAN
FOR THE JOB.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.167
WHAT WAS THAT?

09:57.200 --> 09:59.100
THAT WAS MY SMUG,
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE,

09:59.133 --> 10:01.033
LIMEY EX-BOYFRIEND
TRYING TO SHOW ME

10:01.067 --> 10:02.233
I PICKED THE WRONG GUY.

10:02.267 --> 10:04.167
I-I KNOW,
AND I'M FINE WITH IT

10:04.200 --> 10:06.100
AS LONG
AS I'M LEARNING SOMETHING.

10:06.133 --> 10:08.033
I WAS ACTUALLY
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

10:08.067 --> 10:09.767
WHAT WAS THAT?

10:09.800 --> 10:12.433
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT UP
WITH ME BEING NICE AND SWEET

10:12.467 --> 10:14.400
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
THAT'LL BE
A NICE CHANGE OF PACE.

10:14.433 --> 10:15.533
SHUT UP.

10:15.567 --> 10:17.533
MM, THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.400
HEY, I SAW AVA.
SHE LOOKS TERRIFIC.

10:21.433 --> 10:23.333
YEAH, YEAH, SHE DOES.
SLOAN KICKED IT OUT.

10:23.367 --> 10:26.200
YEAH, WELL, YOU HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT, TOO.

10:26.233 --> 10:27.433
JUST DOING MY JOB.

10:27.467 --> 10:30.067
JEEZ. YOU CANNOT TAKE
A COMPLIMENT.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.833
WELL, I JUST
DON'T WANT PEOPLE THINKING--

10:31.867 --> 10:33.767
WHAT, YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD
THE PERFECT WOMAN?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.700
DR. MONTGOMERY,
THE POLICE JUST CALLED.

10:35.733 --> 10:37.633
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY OVER.
THEY THINK THEY FOUND

10:37.667 --> 10:39.233
JANE DOE'S FAMILY.

10:39.267 --> 10:41.400
(Derek) I'M SURE YOU FELT THAT
YOU NEEDED TO BE EVEN-HANDED

10:41.433 --> 10:43.333
WHEN YOU ANNOUNCED
THAT YOU WERE

10:43.367 --> 10:45.267
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
TO TAKE OVER AS CHIEF.

10:45.300 --> 10:48.233
GIVE EVERYBODY A SHOT
AT THE BRASS RING.
I DID.

10:48.267 --> 10:50.633
CAN WE DROP THAT RUSE SOON?
IT'S NOT A RUSE.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.833
YOU PROMISED ME THE JOB
WHEN I CAME HERE.

10:52.867 --> 10:54.633
IT'S WHY I CAME HERE.
NO, YOU CAME BECAUSE
YOUR MARRIAGE FELL APART

10:54.667 --> 10:57.600
AND YOU HAD TO GET
THE HELL OUT OF DODGE.
WE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING,
AND NOW YOU'RE HAVING ME

10:57.633 --> 10:59.533
JUMP THROUGH HOOPS
WITH EVERY OTHER ATTENDING

10:59.567 --> 11:00.633
IN THIS HOSPITAL.

11:00.667 --> 11:03.167
AND I HEAR YOU'RE GIVING
MARLOWE SPECIAL PRIVILEGES

11:03.200 --> 11:06.067
TO DO A PIGGYBACK SURGERY.
THIS IS
A TEACHING HOSPITAL, DEREK.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.367
YEAH. MY INTERVIEW DIDN'T GO
AS WELL AS I HAD HOPED.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.300
I WOULD LIKE YOUR SUPPORT
WITH THE BOARD.

11:10.333 --> 11:14.067
YOU KNOW MY CREDENTIALS.
YOU KNOW I'M READY.
I ONLY HAVE ONE VOTE.

11:14.067 --> 11:15.567
IT'S A STRONG VOTE.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.067
(door closes)

11:17.067 --> 11:20.767
I'M NOT FEELING WELL.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.633
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT GIRL?

11:24.800 --> 11:28.233
(crying)

11:31.167 --> 11:33.067
(crying continues)

11:33.100 --> 11:34.833
OH, LOOK,
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU

11:34.867 --> 11:36.700
WHEN YOU'RE MAKING
ALL THAT NOISE,

11:36.733 --> 11:38.700
SO PULL IT TOGETHER
AND GET OUT HERE.

11:38.733 --> 11:40.767
NOW.
(crying stops)

11:40.800 --> 11:43.433
(lock clicks)

11:43.467 --> 11:45.800
(sniffles)

11:49.767 --> 11:52.233
(sniffles)

11:52.267 --> 11:57.067
I HAVE
AN 11-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

11:57.067 --> 12:00.767
SHE NEEDS
A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT.

12:00.800 --> 12:05.133
I'M POTENTIALLY A GOOD MATCH.

12:05.167 --> 12:06.700
PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYBODY.
PLEASE.

12:06.733 --> 12:08.633
THIS ISN'T A CHAPTER
OF MY HISTORY THAT--

12:08.667 --> 12:10.567
I UNDERSTAND.

12:14.433 --> 12:17.233
SHE'S HERE...

12:17.267 --> 12:19.200
MY KID...

12:19.233 --> 12:21.133
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO GO
UP TO PEDIATRICS

12:21.167 --> 12:24.667
AND MEET HER RIGHT NOW,
AND...

12:26.867 --> 12:29.667
I MEAN, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT
THIS MOMENT...

12:29.700 --> 12:33.567
WH-WHAT I WOULD LOOK LIKE...

12:33.600 --> 12:38.267
WHAT I WOULD SAY.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.200
BUT I THOUGHT
I WOULD BE OLDER,

12:40.233 --> 12:42.167
MORE TOGETHER, MORE MATURE.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.300
I THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE OLDER.

12:44.333 --> 12:48.067
AND I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT SHE WOULD BE SICK.

12:50.533 --> 12:53.100
OH, GOD.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

12:53.133 --> 12:56.067
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
WHAT DO I DO?

12:59.233 --> 13:00.400
WE LOVE OUR SHANNON,

13:00.433 --> 13:03.600
BUT WE NEVER GOT ALONG
WITH HER HUSBAND.

13:03.633 --> 13:06.233
SO SHE HAS A HUSBAND?
(man) HAD.

13:06.267 --> 13:09.133
ONE DAY WHILE SHE WAS AT WORK,
HE PACKED UP AND DISAPPEARED.

13:09.167 --> 13:11.067
HE DIDN'T WANT A BABY.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.067
BUT SHE WENT AFTER HIM,
EVEN PREGNANT LIKE THAT.

13:13.067 --> 13:14.733
WE HADN'T HEARD FROM HER
IN MONTHS,

13:14.767 --> 13:17.100
AND THEN TODAY WE SAW
HER PICTURE ON TV.

13:17.133 --> 13:19.767
MR. AND MRS. WARING, UH,
THE WOMAN WE FOUND,

13:19.800 --> 13:22.667
IF SHE IS YOUR DAUGHTER...
WELL, HER NOSE IS DIFFERENT,

13:22.700 --> 13:24.533
AND HER CHIN,
BUT THEY SAID THAT

13:24.567 --> 13:26.567
HER FACE HAD BEEN,
YOU KNOW, CHANGED.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.700
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
YOUR DAUGHTER'S BLOOD TYPE?

13:28.733 --> 13:31.067
SHE'S B-POSITIVE.

13:31.067 --> 13:33.633
ANY MEDICAL CONDITIONS,
SURGERIES WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

13:33.667 --> 13:36.700
UM, SHE HAD HER TONSILS OUT
WHEN SHE WAS 12.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.833
IT'S HER, ISN'T IT?

13:38.867 --> 13:41.567
IT'S SHANNON.

13:47.667 --> 13:48.733
SUSAN.

13:48.767 --> 13:51.500
MEREDITH, HI.
I'M SO GLAD I FOUND YOU.

13:51.533 --> 13:53.467
TWICE IN ONE DAY.
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.600
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU'RE
ALWAYS BUSY, BUT--
YEAH, NO, I'M BUSY.
I'M AT WORK.

13:55.633 --> 13:57.533
OKAY, I WAS, UM...

13:57.567 --> 13:59.700
YOU KNOW, I'D REALLY
JUST LOVE TO TALK WITH YOU.

13:59.733 --> 14:02.600
I WOULD LOVE TO FIND A TIME
FOR YOU AND ME TO SIT DOWN--

14:02.633 --> 14:05.133
I'M SORRY. THIS IS TOO MUCH.
WAY TOO MUCH.

14:05.167 --> 14:06.333
YOU KEEP SHOWING UP.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.267
I CANNOT BE YOUR DAUGHTER
OR YOUR CHARITY CASE

14:08.300 --> 14:10.667
OR THE THING THAT YOU NEED
TO FIX.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.133
I'M NOT TRYING TO--

14:12.167 --> 14:14.600
NO, NO. STOP TALKING, OKAY?
STOP MOTHERING.

14:14.633 --> 14:16.400
JUST STOP.

14:18.867 --> 14:21.333
(man) SHE IS MID-30s,
BRUNETTE AND 8 MONTHS PREGNANT.

14:21.367 --> 14:22.533
IF YOU RECOGNIZE HER, PLEASE--

14:22.567 --> 14:24.533
MY GLAMOUR SHOT'S
BEEN ON THE NEWS

14:24.567 --> 14:26.500
AT LEAST
A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.433
ADMIT IT--
YOU'RE GONNA MISS ME

14:28.467 --> 14:31.700
WHEN MY FANCY FAMILY
SHOWS UP TO TAKE ME AWAY.

14:31.733 --> 14:34.267
YOU DON'T KNOW THEY'RE FANCY.
OPEN UP.
WHY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH MY THROAT?

14:34.300 --> 14:36.567
HOW WOULD I KNOW?
I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN IT YET.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.767
NOW OPEN UP.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.700
NO, NOT TILL YOU TELL ME...

14:39.733 --> 14:41.300
WAIT.

14:41.333 --> 14:43.533
SOMEONE HAS RECOGNIZED ME,
HAVEN'T THEY?

14:43.567 --> 14:47.367
ALEX... ALEX, YOU HAVE TO
TELL ME WHO IT IS. PLEASE.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.300
THEIR DAUGHTER'S BLOOD TYPE
IS B-POSITIVE.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.233
SHE'S YOUR AGE.
SHE'S PREGNANT.

14:51.267 --> 14:54.067
YOUR HEIGHT, YOUR HAIR COLOR,
AND SHE HAS NO TONSILS.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.800
SO NOW
ARE YOU GONNA OPEN UP?

14:55.833 --> 14:57.733
YES. PLEASE TELL ME
I HAVE NO TONSILS.

14:57.767 --> 14:59.167
SAY AH.
AH.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.300
NO TONSILS.

15:02.333 --> 15:03.833
(Mrs. Waring) SHANNON?

15:03.867 --> 15:06.567
MR. AND MRS. WARING,
I ASKED YOU TO WAIT.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.333
I HAVE TESTS TO COMPLETE
AND I HAVE TO--
ALEX...

15:09.367 --> 15:11.233
IT'S OKAY.

15:11.267 --> 15:13.833
YOUR NAME...

15:13.867 --> 15:15.667
IS SHANNON MARIE.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.767
(Mr. Waring) MARIE WAS
MY MOTHER'S NAME...

15:17.800 --> 15:20.600
YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

15:20.633 --> 15:24.600
(Ava) SHANNON MARIE.

15:28.367 --> 15:30.267
OKAY, DISCHARGE
BEDS ONE AND THREE.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.367
TWO NEEDS A SOCIAL WORKER.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.300
HOLD THIS DOWN FOR ME,
O'MALLEY.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.367
I'M GONNA BE OUT
FOR A WHILE.
WHY?

15:36.400 --> 15:40.067
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IZZIE?
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH STEVENS
IS NONE OF YOUR CONCERN.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.800
WHAT IS YOUR CONCERN?
SICK PEOPLE--

15:42.833 --> 15:45.700
ALL THESE SICK PEOPLE--
UNTIL I GET BACK. UNDERSTAND?

15:45.733 --> 15:47.767
DR. BAILEY, JUST DID
A CONSULT IN TRAUMA ONE.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.200
THE GUY HAS A PERF.
CAN I SCRUB IN?
NO, YOU CANNOT SCRUB IN.

15:50.233 --> 15:53.367
UH, YOU'RE HERE
WITH O'MALLEY FOR NOW.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.533
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH IZZIE?

15:58.567 --> 16:01.067
BEDS 7 THROUGH 13.
START WITH NUMBER 8.

16:01.067 --> 16:02.767
HE DOESN'T HAVE
MUCH BLADDER CONTROL.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.767
(Preston)
FIRST, MR. REDFORD,

16:03.800 --> 16:06.700
WHILE DR. MARLOWE IS
PREPARING THE SURGICAL AREA,

16:06.733 --> 16:08.633
I WILL BE EXAMINING
THE DONOR HEART.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.767
ACTUALLY, I'M SORRY.
I'LL EXAMINE THE DONOR HEART.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.667
I WANT TO BE SURE
THE I.V.C. ORIFICE IS OVERSEWN.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.333
(clears throat)

16:16.367 --> 16:18.400
WELL, CARRY ON.

16:18.433 --> 16:21.233
THEN I'LL OPEN YOUR CHEST
AND PUT YOU ON BYPASS,

16:21.267 --> 16:24.100
AT WHICH POINT WE WILL
CONNECT THE LEFT ATRIUM

16:24.133 --> 16:25.833
THEN THE RIGHT ATRIUM--
SUPERIOR VENA CAVA.

16:25.867 --> 16:28.700
IT SIMPLIFIES THE SUBSEQUENT
CARDIAC BIOPSIES.

16:28.733 --> 16:30.800
YOU DIDN'T READ MY ARTICLE

16:30.833 --> 16:33.067
IN THE "CARDIOTHORACIC MONTHLY"
LAST YEAR.

16:33.067 --> 16:34.600
DID YOU? HUH?

16:34.633 --> 16:36.433
WELL, I THINK CRISTINA HAS
A COPY OF IT.

16:36.467 --> 16:38.500
CRISTINA, MAY I?
OH, OF COURSE.

16:41.533 --> 16:45.067
OH, WHAT ON EARTH
IS THAT?

16:45.067 --> 16:47.733
OH, TESTING COLORS.

16:47.767 --> 16:49.833
FOR THE BIG DAY,
I ASSUME?

16:49.867 --> 16:52.567
I'M THINKING, UM, CORAL.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.567
HEY, CHIEF, COME HERE.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
I'M BUSY, SLOAN.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.733
I NEED AN UPDATE ON MY PATIENT
IN ROOM 3129.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.433
OH, HI.
HI.

16:59.467 --> 17:03.400
OKAY. I HAVE THAT
RIGHT HERE.

17:03.433 --> 17:05.800
I LIKE THOSE SNEAKERS.
YOU A RUNNER?

17:05.833 --> 17:07.233
YEAH.

17:07.267 --> 17:08.100
ME, TOO.

17:08.133 --> 17:10.633
MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO RUNNING SOME TIME.

17:10.667 --> 17:12.067
SURE.

17:12.067 --> 17:15.733
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN
HELP YOU WITH, DR. SLOAN?

17:15.767 --> 17:17.633
NO. ALL GOOD.

17:20.567 --> 17:22.400
WINGMAN.

17:22.433 --> 17:24.433
WINGMAN.

17:24.467 --> 17:27.067
HANNAH IS IN THERE
RIGHT NOW?

17:27.100 --> 17:28.567
SHE IS.

17:34.567 --> 17:37.833
(sighs) YOU SEE HER,
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

17:37.867 --> 17:40.567
MUST BE NICE TO KNOW
SHE HAS PARENTS LIKE THIS,

17:40.600 --> 17:42.533
WHO FIGHT FOR HER,

17:42.567 --> 17:44.467
THINK ABOUT WHAT SHE WANTS,

17:44.500 --> 17:47.367
TRY TO MAKE HER HAPPY
LIKE YOU WOULD'VE.

17:49.600 --> 17:53.167
DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T WANT
THAT GIRL TO WANT YOU.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.067
YEAH.

17:58.067 --> 17:59.200
MM.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.667
I'M...

18:06.700 --> 18:08.733
SHE'S SO, SO TIRED.

18:08.767 --> 18:11.633
WE LEFT IT UP TO HANNAH,
AND, UH, SHE'S JUST NOT READY.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.567
I'M SORRY.
WE DON'T WANT
TO FORCE IT.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.267
MAYBE ANOTHER TIME?
WHEN SHE'S FEELING BETTER.

18:16.300 --> 18:19.400
NO, OF COURSE.
I UNDERSTAND.

18:19.433 --> 18:23.067
I'M SORRY,
BUT... THE TRANSPLANT?

18:25.500 --> 18:27.533
STEVENS.

18:27.567 --> 18:30.733
(whispers) HEY, LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

18:30.767 --> 18:32.667
YOUR GIRL...

18:32.700 --> 18:35.567
YOU CAN WANT HER
TO WANT YOU ALL DAY LONG,

18:35.600 --> 18:37.833
BUT SHE HAS TO BE HERE

18:37.867 --> 18:41.733
IF SHE'S EVER GONNA HAVE
THAT CHANCE AGAIN.

18:41.767 --> 18:43.700
I'M SORRY.

18:43.733 --> 18:46.767
OF COURSE. YEAH.
I'M READY. LET'S GET STARTED.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.233
HEY, GUESS WHAT.
I'M A TEACHER.

18:52.267 --> 18:55.400
I TEACH SECOND GRADE
AT NORTH BEND ELEMENTARY.

18:55.433 --> 18:57.367
OH.
OR AT LEAST I DID UNTIL--

18:57.400 --> 18:59.067
YOU CAN GET YOUR JOB BACK
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

18:59.100 --> 19:02.500
THEY LOVE YOU THERE. WHEN WILL
WE BE ABLE TO TAKE HER HOME?

19:02.533 --> 19:04.433
Y-YOU WANT TO TAKE HER
BACK TO--

19:04.467 --> 19:06.467
NORTH BEND. WE'VE GOT A ROOM
ALL SETUP FOR HER.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.667
YOUR MOM'S GOT ALL OF YOUR BOOKS
AND YOUR LETTERS AND DIARIES.

19:08.700 --> 19:10.600
I KEPT DIARIES?
(chuckles) ABOUT 800 OF THEM.

19:10.633 --> 19:12.467
SO EVEN IF YOU DON'T
REMEMBER EVERYTHING NOW,

19:12.500 --> 19:15.067
YOU WILL.

19:15.067 --> 19:16.400
(chuckles) HEAR THAT?

19:16.433 --> 19:18.233
I CAN GO, RIGHT?

19:18.267 --> 19:20.300
WELL, YOU'RE STILL GETTING
I.V. ANTIBIOTICS,

19:20.333 --> 19:22.800
AND WE'RE MONITORING THE BABY
VERY CLOSELY RIGHT NOW.

19:22.833 --> 19:25.233
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN
MAKE IT HAPPEN, RIGHT?

19:25.267 --> 19:27.167
COME ON, ALEX.
D-DON'T DOCTOR ME.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.367
HELP ME GET OUTTA HERE.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.467
DR. MONTGOMERY'S GOT YOU
ON STRICT BED REST

19:31.500 --> 19:35.233
UNTIL YOUR DELIVERY.

19:35.267 --> 19:38.233
BUT I'LL ASK. MAYBE--MAYBE YOU
CAN DO IT FROM HOME.

19:38.267 --> 19:40.067
HOME.

19:40.067 --> 19:43.133
(laughs)

19:43.167 --> 19:45.800
(sighs) HEY.
HEY.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.200
YOU OKAY? YOU LOOK--
HORRIBLE.
I'M IN A HORRIBLE MOOD.

19:48.233 --> 19:49.567
I YELLED AT SUSAN.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.467
I THINK I SCARED OFF
MY FAKE MOMMY FOREVER.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.400
MM. NEED CHEERING UP?

19:54.433 --> 19:56.300
NO.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.267
ME EITHER.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

19:58.300 --> 20:01.233
YOU THINK?
YEAH, SUSAN WILL BE OKAY.

20:05.733 --> 20:07.200
HOW'D IT GO WITH THE CHIEF?

20:07.233 --> 20:09.133
UH, ABOUT AS WELL
AS YOU AND SUSAN.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.633
WOW. WE MAKE A GOOD TEAM.
(chuckles)

20:13.833 --> 20:15.733
***

20:15.767 --> 20:17.433
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU

20:17.467 --> 20:19.333
IN REALLY-OLD-GUY'S ROOM
FOR 20 MINUTES.

20:19.367 --> 20:21.567
WHAT GIVES?
SORRY. WE DECIDED
TO EAT DOWN HERE TODAY.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.833
NOBODY TOLD ME.
ANYBODY... MOVE.

20:23.867 --> 20:26.533
ANYBODY KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IZZIE?

20:26.567 --> 20:28.433
SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

20:28.467 --> 20:30.367
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST ASK HER YOURSELF?

20:30.400 --> 20:32.700
FINE. I WOULD IF I KNEW
WHERE SHE WAS.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.633
I BROUGHT YOU LUNCH.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.467
***

20:36.500 --> 20:38.367
YOU'VE GOT STUFF
ON YOUR HANDS.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.467
I'M TRYING TO SCARE AWAY
CARDIO GOD.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.333
WITH PRETTY, PRETTY FINGERS?

20:41.367 --> 20:43.267
HE TAKES MY ROOK,
I TAKE HIS BISHOP.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.067
HEY, POUTY HEAD.
OH, ARE YOU SO SAD

20:45.100 --> 20:47.567
'CAUSE NO-FACE GIRL'S FAMILY
IS TAKING HER HOME?

20:47.600 --> 20:50.033
REALLY? SOMEONE CLAIMED AVA?
YEAH, HER PARENTS.

20:50.067 --> 20:52.133
SHE MUST BE SO RELIEVED.
YEAH, UNLESS THEY SUCK.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.667
CAN YOU IMAGINE,

20:53.700 --> 20:55.600
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER A FAMILY,
AND THEY SHOW UP,

20:55.633 --> 20:57.633
AND IT TURNS OUT
THEY'RE PSYCHO KILLERS?
OR OVER SHARERS.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.167
WHATEVER. SHE'S A PATIENT.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.067
I DON'T GIVE A CRAP WHO HER
PARENTS ARE, WHERE SHE GOES.

21:01.067 --> 21:02.833
CAN WE MOVE ON?

21:02.867 --> 21:05.167
ONE SECOND.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.100
WHAT'S UP WITH IZZIE?

21:07.133 --> 21:09.400
D--I TOLD YOU,
IT'S NONE OF YOUR CONCERN.
NO, IT IS MY CONCERN.

21:09.433 --> 21:11.200
I DEMAND TO KNOW.

21:11.233 --> 21:13.267
I HOPE I DIDN'T JUST HEAR YOU
SAY YOU DEMAND.

21:13.300 --> 21:15.767
WELL, ARE YOU HER FATHER?
ARE YOU HER HUSBAND?

21:18.800 --> 21:21.600
YOU HEAR ME?

21:21.633 --> 21:22.667
GREY.

21:22.700 --> 21:25.600
UH, LOOK, I NEED
TO BE UPSTAIRS,

21:25.633 --> 21:28.400
SO DO NOT LET THIS
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

21:28.433 --> 21:31.300
WALK THIS TO THE LAB,
WATCH THE LAB RUN THE TEST,

21:31.333 --> 21:35.167
BRING THE TEST RESULTS
DIRECTLY TO ME, NOBODY ELSE.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.700
IT'S IZZIE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

21:38.733 --> 21:41.600
YOU WILL BE DISCREET AND NOT ASK
A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS.

21:41.633 --> 21:45.700
NOW THIS IS A PRIVATE MATTER.
SHE NEEDS THESE RESULTS NOW.

21:45.733 --> 21:47.467
OKAY.

21:55.267 --> 21:58.067
(inhales sharply) WOW.
THAT'S A BIG NEEDLE.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.800
(laughs)
(man) IT'S STANDARD.

21:59.833 --> 22:01.767
YOU SHOULD START TO FEEL NUMB

22:01.800 --> 22:03.700
ABOUT TEN MINUTES AFTER
I INJECT THE LIDOCAINE, OKAY?

22:03.733 --> 22:05.633
YEAH. NO, I KNOW.
I'VE GIVEN EPIDURALS BEFORE.

22:05.667 --> 22:07.167
I KNOW THAT'S THE NEEDLE.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.500
IT'S JUST THAT SOMEHOW
IT SEEMS SO MUCH BIGGER

22:09.533 --> 22:11.633
NOW THAT IT'S GOING
INTO MY SPINE.
LITTLE STICK.

22:11.667 --> 22:14.533
OH, MY GOD.
YOU SURE I CAN'T CALL SOMEONE?
ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS?

22:14.567 --> 22:17.233
YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEBODY
TO HOLD YOUR HAND.

22:17.267 --> 22:19.533
NO. THANK YOU.

22:19.567 --> 22:22.067
LOOK, YOU SURE?

22:25.833 --> 22:27.733
YEAH, WELL, I CAN TAKE
A LOT OF PRESSURE,

22:27.767 --> 22:30.500
JUST...
IT'S ROUGH AS SANDPAPER.

22:30.533 --> 22:32.700
(laughs)

22:32.733 --> 22:35.500
(man) A LITTLE PRESSURE.

22:37.533 --> 22:40.333
MEREDITH...
TELL ME WHERE SHE IS.

22:40.367 --> 22:43.267
I CAN'T. IF SHE WANTED YOU
TO KNOW, GEORGE--
SHE DOES. SHE JUST...

22:43.300 --> 22:45.600
WE'RE JUST HAVING
ONE OF OUR STUPID FIGHTS.

22:45.633 --> 22:48.500
DO YOU KNOW HOW WRONG IT IS
IF SHE'S REALLY IN TROUBLE

22:48.533 --> 22:51.300
AND I'M NOT THERE
BECAUSE WE'RE BEING IDIOTS?

22:51.333 --> 22:53.767
COME ON.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.767
MEREDITH, PLEASE.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.767
SHE'S UPSTAIRS
IN PROCEDURE ROOM "A."

22:58.800 --> 23:00.467
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.700
THANK YOU.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.267
SO... DR. MONTGOMERY SAYS

23:07.300 --> 23:09.200
YOU CAN TAKE
YOUR DAUGHTER HOME.

23:09.233 --> 23:11.300
BUT SHE WANTS TO TALK TO
HER LOCAL O.B.-G.Y.N.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.233
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
SHE WANTS TO GO OVER

23:13.267 --> 23:15.833
BEFORE WE RELEASE HER.
I CAN'T.

23:15.867 --> 23:18.700
OKAY. WELL, I CAN GO THROUGH
ALL THIS WITH YOUR HUSBAND IF--

23:18.733 --> 23:20.167
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.633
I CAN'T TAKE HER HOME.

23:23.800 --> 23:27.267
THAT GIRL IS NOT MY DAUGHTER.

23:32.200 --> 23:36.233
SHE DOES LOOK
AN AWFUL LOT LIKE SHANNON.

23:36.267 --> 23:40.067
SOMETIMES
SHE EVEN SOUNDS LIKE HER.

23:40.067 --> 23:41.267
YOU KNOW, WITH THE SURGERY

23:41.300 --> 23:43.200
AND, UH,
THE LOSS OF MEMORIES--

23:43.233 --> 23:46.067
A MOTHER KNOWS HER OWN CHILD,
DR. KAREV,

23:46.067 --> 23:47.800
AND THAT IS NOT MY CHILD.

23:47.833 --> 23:49.733
BUT YOUR HUSBAND, HE'S--

23:49.767 --> 23:51.433
LOOK, IF THAT'S NOT SHANNON,

23:51.467 --> 23:54.267
WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHERE OUR GIRL IS.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.600
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
HE NEEDS IT TO BE HER.

23:56.633 --> 23:59.400
(sighs) HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO TELL HIM?

23:59.433 --> 24:01.333
HOW DO I TELL
EITHER OF THEM?

24:01.367 --> 24:02.533
MRS. WARING--

24:02.567 --> 24:04.267
DR. KAREV...

24:04.300 --> 24:08.100
WOULD YOU ASK MY HUSBAND
TO MEET ME IN THE LOBBY?

24:08.133 --> 24:10.100
YOU NEED TO FACE HER.

24:10.133 --> 24:12.400
PLEASE...
TELL HER I'M SORRY.

24:15.667 --> 24:17.300
(Richard)
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

24:17.333 --> 24:19.200
NO, NO. NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

24:19.233 --> 24:22.267
I DESERVE YOUR SUPPORT, RICHARD.
TELL ME I HAVE IT.

24:22.300 --> 24:24.200
TELL ME I DIDN'T MOVE
TO SEATTLE FOR NOTHING.

24:24.233 --> 24:27.100
YOU MOVED TO SEATTLE TO START
A NEW LIFE, AND YOU DID.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.067
YOU HAVE A FANTASTIC WOMAN
WHO LOVES YOU.

24:29.067 --> 24:30.800
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
MY PERSONAL LIFE.

24:30.833 --> 24:33.700
THIS IS ABOUT MY CAREER.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT BEING CHIEF
WILL DO TO YOUR LIFE?

24:33.733 --> 24:36.067
WHY THE HELL DO YOU THINK
I'M GETTING A DIVORCE

24:36.067 --> 24:37.533
OR DYEING MY HAIR?

24:37.567 --> 24:40.333
YOU CAN'T DO IT ALL,
NOT IF YOU WANT TO BE CHIEF.
YOU COULDN'T DO IT ALL.

24:40.367 --> 24:42.233
AND NEITHER CAN YOU.
DON'T PUT YOUR MISTAKE ON ME.

24:42.267 --> 24:44.267
DON'T. I AM THE BEST CANDIDATE
FOR THIS JOB.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.433
YOU KNOW IT, AND I KNOW IT,
AND THAT IS THE ONLY FACTOR

24:46.467 --> 24:48.367
YOU NEED TO TAKE
INTO CONSIDERATION HERE.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.800
I DON'T NEED YOUR PROTECTION,
RICHARD, AND I DON'T WANT IT.

24:50.833 --> 24:53.267
I'M NOT TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU, DEREK.

24:53.300 --> 24:55.267
I TOLD ELLIS...

24:55.300 --> 25:00.467
I PROMISED HER THAT I WOULD
LOOK AFTER HER DAUGHTER.

25:03.267 --> 25:05.667
(door closes)

25:07.633 --> 25:12.133
O'MALLEY, DID STEVENS
ASK FOR YOU HERE?
NO! NO, I DID NOT.

25:12.167 --> 25:14.300
THEN YOU NEED TO TURN
YOURSELF AROUND--
YOU'RE GIVING BONE MARROW?

25:14.333 --> 25:16.800
THIS IS A PRIVATE MATTER.
I'M NOT LEAVING.

25:16.833 --> 25:18.633
(sighs) GEORGE.

25:18.667 --> 25:20.400
NO.

25:20.433 --> 25:22.567
MAKE ME.
HEY!

25:22.600 --> 25:23.833
SORRY, I'M STARTING NOW.

25:23.867 --> 25:27.467
JUST LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE
GONNA DO STUFF, OKAY?

25:27.500 --> 25:29.167
HEY... YOU'RE OKAY.

25:31.133 --> 25:33.300
I GOT IT HERE.

25:37.167 --> 25:39.800
FINE. STEVENS, I'M GOING.

25:39.833 --> 25:41.733
UNLESS YOU NEED ME
TO CALL SECURITY.

25:41.767 --> 25:43.067
(chuckles) I'LL MANAGE.

25:45.467 --> 25:46.667
THANK YOU.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.167
YOU SAID BACK OFF.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.067
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU WERE HAVING

25:57.100 --> 25:59.133
A HOLE DRILLED
IN YOUR DAMN HIP.

25:59.167 --> 26:01.067
FOR WHO?

26:02.700 --> 26:05.067
WHAT'S THIS PRIVATE MATTER?

26:06.800 --> 26:10.467
OKAY, I'M GOING IN
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

26:10.500 --> 26:12.633
READY?

26:14.167 --> 26:16.100
(Izzie groans)

26:16.133 --> 26:18.233
(hisses)

26:20.200 --> 26:21.367
HEY, CALLIE.

26:21.400 --> 26:22.233
HEY.

26:22.267 --> 26:24.300
HEY, SO IF YOU COULD
JUST TAKE THESE TWO,

26:24.333 --> 26:27.200
THEN THAT'LL FREE ME UP--
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, I'M NOT HERE TO WORK.

26:27.233 --> 26:29.133
I'M--I'M--I'M, UH,
I'M--I'M SORRY.

26:29.167 --> 26:31.067
I HAVEN'T SLEPT
IN LIKE TWO DAYS,

26:31.100 --> 26:32.833
AND, UH, I'M ACTUALLY
LOOKING FOR GEORGE.

26:32.867 --> 26:34.767
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEET UP
FOR COFFEE.
OH.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.700
SO...
HE'S, UH, WITH IZZIE,
I THINK.

26:36.733 --> 26:38.633
SO IF YOU'RE
NOT HERE TO WORK,

26:38.667 --> 26:41.233
I'M JUST GONNA
TAKE THESE BACK. THANKS.

26:43.333 --> 26:45.800
(Preston) 15-BLADE.

26:45.833 --> 26:48.200
SUCTION, PLEASE.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.800
DR. BURKE, YOU'RE NOT USING

26:51.833 --> 26:53.333
THE SUPERIOR-
TRANSSEPTAL APPROACH

26:53.367 --> 26:54.700
FOR THE ATRIOTOMY,
ARE YOU?

26:54.733 --> 26:56.433
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

26:56.467 --> 26:58.433
NOT AT ALL
UNLESS YOUR INTENTION

26:58.467 --> 27:00.333
IS TO KILL THE PATIENT.

27:00.367 --> 27:02.133
DR. MARLOWE,
FROM WHAT I'VE READ--

27:02.167 --> 27:04.433
YES, WELL, READING ABOUT
A PROCEDURE IS ONE THING

27:04.467 --> 27:06.367
AND, UH, PERFORMING IT
IS QUITE ANOTHER.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.733
IT WAS MY MISTAKE.

27:07.767 --> 27:09.800
I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE ALLOWED YOU TO SCRUB IN.

27:09.833 --> 27:12.500
I THINK IT BEST
FROM THIS POINT ON

27:12.533 --> 27:14.233
THAT YOU SIMPLY OBSERVE.

27:16.867 --> 27:19.067
SUCTION, PLEASE.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.667
HURRY UP.

27:22.700 --> 27:24.500
(whooshing sound)

27:26.100 --> 27:27.533
(George) YOU SHOULD USE
THE WHEELCHAIR.

27:27.567 --> 27:29.800
YOU'RE GONNA BE SORE.
I'M AWARE.

27:29.833 --> 27:33.267
I'M FINE NOW. THANK YOU.

27:33.300 --> 27:35.133
UH, YOU MEAN
PANTLESS BUT FINE?

27:35.167 --> 27:37.567
(sighs) CRAP.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.133
OH.

27:45.367 --> 27:46.500
(groans)

27:46.533 --> 27:48.167
STAND.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.433
(sighs)

27:51.767 --> 27:55.333
***

28:02.767 --> 28:05.533
***

28:05.567 --> 28:07.567
I GOT IT.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.300
OKAY. OKAY.

28:12.433 --> 28:14.333
***

28:14.367 --> 28:16.167
MM.

28:19.067 --> 28:23.167
HANNAH...
AN 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

28:23.200 --> 28:26.633
THAT'S THE PRIVATE MATTER.
SHE'S MINE.

28:26.667 --> 28:29.500
DON'T...

28:29.533 --> 28:30.700
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

28:30.733 --> 28:34.567
***

28:34.600 --> 28:35.533
(sniffles)

28:35.567 --> 28:39.367
MY MOTHER WANTED ME
TO KEEP HER.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.300
BUT I KNEW--EVEN AT 16--

28:41.333 --> 28:44.500
I KNEW THAT BABY
DESERVED BETTER

28:44.533 --> 28:49.067
THAN LIFE...
AT A CHEHALIS TRAILER PARK.

28:49.100 --> 28:52.367
AND NOW SHE'S HERE AND...

28:52.400 --> 28:53.567
AND SHE MIGHT BE DYING

28:53.600 --> 28:55.500
AND SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO MEET ME.

28:55.533 --> 28:59.333
***

28:59.367 --> 29:02.167
OH, CRAP.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.600
(sniffles)

29:04.633 --> 29:07.067
I DIDN'T THINK
I REALLY CARED

29:07.067 --> 29:10.467
UNTIL SHE SAID NO.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.667
HOW ABOUT THAT?

29:11.700 --> 29:16.433
(chuckles)

29:16.467 --> 29:19.367
***

29:22.533 --> 29:26.233
I CAN SAY HAIL MARYS
UNTIL...

29:26.267 --> 29:29.500
UNTIL I TURN INTO MARY,
BUT I STILL MISS YOU.

29:31.133 --> 29:34.467
NOT THE...

29:34.500 --> 29:37.500
THE SEX.

29:37.533 --> 29:41.167
IT WAS NOT TRAGIC,
GEORGE.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.367
BUT I'LL LIVE WITHOUT IT.

29:45.333 --> 29:49.133
I WON'T MAKE IT
IF YOU CAN'T BE MY FRIEND.

29:49.167 --> 29:51.200
IF WE CAN'T...

29:53.467 --> 29:58.067
***

29:58.067 --> 30:00.767
WHAT YOU DID TODAY...

30:00.800 --> 30:03.500
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

30:05.267 --> 30:08.367
I'LL GET AN ORDERLY
TO TAKE YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.767
BUT I HAVE TO GO.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.067
***

30:13.100 --> 30:15.267
YOU UNDERSTAND?

30:17.867 --> 30:20.767
***

30:28.533 --> 30:32.267
OH. OW.

30:32.300 --> 30:35.133
***

30:40.100 --> 30:44.100
(sighs)

30:45.800 --> 30:48.333
SOME SURGERY.

30:48.367 --> 30:51.100
AND COLIN WAS A COMPL--

30:51.133 --> 30:52.500
BRILLIANT.

30:52.533 --> 30:55.500
HE'S A GIFTED SURGEON.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.100
LISTEN, I HAD A QUESTION.

31:01.133 --> 31:03.600
WHEN YOU MOVED THE ATRIUM
TO THE VENA CAVA,

31:03.633 --> 31:06.700
WHY DID YOU SWITCH
FROM 3-0 TO 5-0 SUTURES?

31:06.733 --> 31:09.367
YOU WANT TO USE
THE FINEST SUTURES YOU CAN

31:09.400 --> 31:10.567
FOR VASCULAR STRUCTURES.

31:10.600 --> 31:15.433
A DELICATE TISSUE
DEMANDS A DELICATE TOUCH.

31:15.467 --> 31:17.267
RIGHT.

31:17.300 --> 31:18.467
THAT MAKES SENSE.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.167
THANK YOU.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.133
OF COURSE.

31:22.167 --> 31:24.100
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME?

31:24.133 --> 31:25.500
YEAH.

31:33.700 --> 31:36.600
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN STANDING THERE?
LONG ENOUGH.

31:36.633 --> 31:39.833
WE'VE BEEN PLAYING
OUR LITTLE GAME ALL DAY LONG.

31:39.867 --> 31:43.200
BUT WHAT I JUST SAW...
THAT WAS REAL.

31:43.233 --> 31:45.133
THE QUESTION YOU ASKED HIM
ABOUT THE SUTURES,

31:45.167 --> 31:47.833
THAT WAS FROM MY PAPER,
THE PAPER YOU HELPED ME WRITE.

31:47.867 --> 31:49.767
YOU ALREADY KNEW THE ANSWER.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.533
THE CRISTINA YANG I KNEW...

31:52.567 --> 31:55.467
WAS CONCERNED WITH EXCELLENCE.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.600
SHE WOULD NEVER PLAY THE PART
OF THE HELPLESS GIRL

31:58.633 --> 32:00.467
TRYING TO BUILD UP
A GROWN MAN'S EGO.

32:00.500 --> 32:03.300
WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOU?
I HAVE LEARNED THAT SOMETIMES

32:03.333 --> 32:05.233
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
OTHER PEOPLE.

32:05.267 --> 32:07.300
YOU'VE COMPROMISED YOURSELF.

32:07.333 --> 32:09.233
NO.

32:09.267 --> 32:11.167
I'M GOING HOME.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.700
IT'S SENSELESS,
COMING HERE,

32:12.733 --> 32:14.700
CHASING AFTER A JOB
THAT WAS BENEATH ME

32:14.733 --> 32:17.500
JUST SO I COULD BE NEAR
A WOMAN WHO...

32:17.533 --> 32:21.667
A WOMAN WHO APPARENTLY
NO LONGER EXISTS.

32:25.167 --> 32:29.100
BEST OF LUCK...
WITH THE WEDDING.

32:42.500 --> 32:45.567
NO, THERE THEY ARE.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.267
COME ON.

32:47.300 --> 32:48.467
I CAN'T. I-I CAN'T.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.400
YOU LOOK. PLEASE.
YOU LOOK FOR ME.

32:50.433 --> 32:52.300
OKAY.

32:52.333 --> 32:56.067
***

32:56.067 --> 32:58.167
SHE'S GETTING THE INFUSION.
YOU DID IT.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.167
IS SHE, UM...

33:00.200 --> 33:02.067
HOW DOES SHE LOOK?

33:02.067 --> 33:03.800
YOU CAN--YOU CAN SEE
FOR YOURSELF.

33:03.833 --> 33:06.500
IT'S OKAY.
SHE CAN'T SEE US FROM HERE.

33:06.533 --> 33:09.667
***

33:13.200 --> 33:14.633
SHE'S GOT YOUR EYES...

33:14.667 --> 33:17.500
AND YOUR MOUTH.

33:17.533 --> 33:18.800
OH...

33:18.833 --> 33:20.767
THAT MEANS SHE PROBABLY
TALKS A LOT

33:20.800 --> 33:22.333
AND EATS A LOT THEN.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.433
***

33:27.467 --> 33:31.833
IF SHE'S IN PAIN,
SHE'S NOT LETTING ON.

33:31.867 --> 33:34.533
MAN, SHE'S TOUGH.

33:34.567 --> 33:38.333
***

33:49.067 --> 33:52.767

33:52.800 --> 33:55.200
THAT'S HER, GEORGE.
THAT'S HANNAH.

33:55.233 --> 33:56.633
YEAH.

34:00.067 --> 34:01.800
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

34:01.833 --> 34:03.800
SHE'S REALLY...
BEAUTIFUL.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.733
YEAH.

34:06.767 --> 34:09.300
YEAH, SHE'S A HEARTBREAKER.

34:09.333 --> 34:12.667
***

34:17.300 --> 34:19.267
YOU NEED SOME HELP
WITH THAT?

34:19.300 --> 34:21.200
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
JUST WANDER IN HERE

34:21.233 --> 34:23.567
TO HELP ME CHANGE
PILLOWCASES.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.567
YOU WARNED ME
SHE COULD BECOME A PROBLEM.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.500
WHO, MEREDITH?

34:27.533 --> 34:29.333
YOU KNOW,
YOU LOVE SOMEBODY,

34:29.367 --> 34:31.600
YOU THINK YOU CAN
HANDLE IT ALL.
YOU'VE DONE ALL RIGHT.

34:31.633 --> 34:34.500
I CAME OUT HERE
TO BE CHIEF,

34:34.533 --> 34:36.433
AND MEREDITH
COMPLICATES THAT.

34:36.467 --> 34:39.333
HUH. WELL, IF THIS
TURNS INTO AN EITHER/OR,

34:39.367 --> 34:41.367
YOU PICK THE PERSON
YOU LOVE,

34:41.400 --> 34:43.300
END OF STORY.

34:43.333 --> 34:46.533
LOOK, ALL OF THIS MEANS NOTHING
IF YOU'RE ALONE.

34:51.833 --> 34:54.633
(elevator bell dings)

34:56.867 --> 34:58.800
OH, CRAP!

34:58.833 --> 35:01.300
OUR COFFEE.
I'M--I'M SORRY.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.233
I'VE--I FORGOT.
I GOT...

35:03.267 --> 35:04.633
I GOT SO BUSY--

35:04.667 --> 35:06.200
OH, YEAH? WITH WHAT?

35:06.233 --> 35:08.167
OH, J--THE CLINIC,

35:08.200 --> 35:10.567
PATIENTS AND--
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

35:12.800 --> 35:15.067
OH, MAN.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.500
YEAH,
I KNOW HOW IT IS, SO...

35:18.533 --> 35:20.433
I'M REALLY TIRED.
I'M REALLY, REALLY TIRED.

35:20.467 --> 35:22.433
YEAH?
SO I'LL JUST--
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

35:22.467 --> 35:24.367
OKAY.
OKAY.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.600
OKAY, OKAY.

35:28.633 --> 35:30.400
SOLITAIRE.

35:30.433 --> 35:33.200
MY DAD TAUGHT ME.
THAT SOUNDS SO WEIRD.

35:33.233 --> 35:35.067
"MY DAD."

35:35.100 --> 35:36.767
GOOD WEIRD, THOUGH.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.200
SO YOU AND THE REDHEAD
GONNA LET ME GO HOME?

35:39.233 --> 35:42.633
OR WERE YOU TOO BUSY MAKING EYES
AT EACH OTHER TO EVEN ASK?

35:42.667 --> 35:44.400
(sighs) WHAT?

35:44.433 --> 35:45.667
AVA...

35:45.700 --> 35:48.300
NO. IT'S SHANNON.

35:48.333 --> 35:49.733
LISTEN--

35:49.767 --> 35:52.633
MY NAME IS SHANNON.
SHANNON MARIE.

35:52.667 --> 35:55.100
I'M SORRY.

36:00.367 --> 36:03.233
THOSE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
MY PEOPLE.

36:03.267 --> 36:05.467
I BELONG WITH THEM, ALEX.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.767
I'M SUPPOSED TO GO
WITH THEM.

36:07.800 --> 36:11.500
YOUR PEOPLE, WE--WE DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHO THEY ARE YET.
YOU DON'T WANT TO FIND THEM.

36:11.533 --> 36:13.300
YOU WANT TO KEEP ME
ALL TO YOURSELF.

36:13.333 --> 36:15.233
WELL, HERE I AM,

36:15.267 --> 36:17.300
YOUR PATHETIC
CAPTIVE AUDIENCE.

36:17.333 --> 36:20.700
ISN'T IT SAD THAT I'M
THE BEST YOU CAN DO?
AVA--

36:20.733 --> 36:22.100
MY NAME IS NOT AVA!

36:22.133 --> 36:24.600
YOU MADE IT UP!
IT'S NOT ME!

36:24.633 --> 36:26.200

GET OUT!

36:36.600 --> 36:39.467
SLOAN, YOU BROUGHT ME
TO A BAR.

36:39.500 --> 36:41.500
YOU KNOW I DON'T DRINK.
WHICH IS PERFECT.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.733
BETTER TO KEEP YOUR MIND SHARP.
LET THE LADIES DO THE DRINKING.

AT SOME POINT,
WE ALL HAVE TO CHOOSE.

36:54.133 --> 36:56.700

THE FINGERNAILS,
THE HAND HOLDING,

37:07.333 --> 37:08.667
WELL PLAYED.

37:08.700 --> 37:12.667
NOW YOU CAN GET BACK
TO BEING CRISTINA.

37:12.700 --> 37:16.500

YOU, TOO.

39:49.833 --> 39:52.800
THE LAST TIME I TRIED
TO PICK UP A WOMAN,

39:52.833 --> 39:54.733

IN ONE HAND

39:54.767 --> 39:57.067

IN THE OTHER.

39:57.067 --> 39:58.400
OH, RICHARD.

39:58.433 --> 40:00.767
WELL, YOU THINK ABOUT IT.
I MEAN, WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED,

40:00.800 --> 40:03.167
YOU'D LIKE TO THINK
YOU STILL HAVE GAME.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.200
PRACTICE ON ME.

40:05.233 --> 40:07.133
I'M SORRY?

40:07.167 --> 40:08.333
MM, MARK'S RIGHT.

40:08.367 --> 40:10.267
I MEAN, HE'S WRONG ABOUT
SO MANY THINGS,

40:10.300 --> 40:12.200
BUT HE IS RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

40:12.233 --> 40:14.600
YOU NEED TO GET BACK OUT THERE.
SO... PRACTICE.

40:14.633 --> 40:17.067
OH, ADDISON, I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHERE TO START.

40:17.100 --> 40:18.433
ASK ME TO DANCE.

40:18.467 --> 40:19.367
(scoffs)

40:19.400 --> 40:21.467
WELL, THERE'S--
THERE'S NO DANCE FLOOR.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.600
SO? ASK ME ANYWAY.

40:23.633 --> 40:27.267
***

40:29.500 --> 40:32.100
SO WE HAVE TO REMEMBER...

40:32.133 --> 40:35.600
SOMETIMES
THE MOST IMPORTANT HISTORY

40:35.633 --> 40:38.700
IS THE HISTORY
WE'RE MAKING TODAY.

40:38.733 --> 40:40.700
