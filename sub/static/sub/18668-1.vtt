WEBVTT

00:17.267 --> 00:19.685
(line ringing)

00:19.853 --> 00:21.979
- (male voice) Boss...
- (male 2) Something happened.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.272
What's wrong?

00:23.440 --> 00:26.442
(male 1 ) You'll have the item today,
just like we agreed.

00:26.609 --> 00:29.111
It's as good as in your hands.

00:29.279 --> 00:33.032
- Nothing can go wrong.
- You contemptible canine.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.409
Don't call me canine.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.202
- Do you know what patience means?
- Silence!

00:37.370 --> 00:42.416
As long as dogs are involved,
anything can go wrong.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.877
I'll take that as a no.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.254
Jeez, what a hothead.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.676
Eh... Keep your quarter.

02:36.573 --> 02:40.409
(female dog) I am proud to present this
special token to our dear...

02:40.577 --> 02:42.870
Only in heaven
can a bunch of squeaky-clean angels

02:43.037 --> 02:46.206
get awards
for being extra squeaky-clean.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.465
And now, our final honoree,

02:55.633 --> 02:58.760
voted Most Rehabilitated
by our heavenly jury.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.512
He's a dog who is...

03:00.680 --> 03:03.724
Wouldn't be caught dead wearing
one of those merit badges, eh, Carface?

03:03.892 --> 03:05.559
Hey. Sh!

03:05.727 --> 03:08.645
A dog who's lifted himself up
from the depths of depravity,

03:08.813 --> 03:12.107
who proves that every dog deserves
a second chance in heaven.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.359
Now I know why they call it eternity.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.863
- Everything here takes forever.
- (all) Sh!

03:18.031 --> 03:20.115
Charlie, show some respect.

03:20.283 --> 03:23.285
For making the most
ofwhat he's had to work with,

03:23.453 --> 03:28.749
this first-class, diamond-studded,
angel-wing pin goes to... (gasps)

03:28.917 --> 03:31.793
- ...Carface Caruthers.
- Huh?

03:31.961 --> 03:35.172
What an honor. (laughs) You're too kind.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.093
I don't know what to say.

03:40.261 --> 03:43.680
Thank you. Thank you very much.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.268
Bless you.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.938
(female dog) I only hope
that our other angels,

03:51.105 --> 03:54.316
who have yet
to distinguish themselves,

03:54.484 --> 03:58.028
soon follow your shining example.

03:58.655 --> 04:02.032
Hey, remember, Charlie,
it never hurts to play the game.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.867
Halo polisher.

04:05.286 --> 04:07.871
(fanfare sounds)

04:11.417 --> 04:12.918
Whoa, I'm late.

04:23.888 --> 04:26.431
That feels good.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.702
Yah!

04:47.662 --> 04:49.746
- (grunts)
- (squeals)

04:49.914 --> 04:52.582
Sorry. Lousy brake pads.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.501
Have the newcomers
touched down yet?

04:54.669 --> 04:56.628
No, not yet.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.304
(grunts)

05:07.807 --> 05:09.641
Put on some weight, huh, Fluffy?

05:09.809 --> 05:13.312
Check. Go ahead, 15.
Check. Move along.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.939
Sorry, sir.

05:17.358 --> 05:20.402
Check. Check. Check. Move along.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.739
That's it. That's all dogs.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.533
Hold it, hold it, let me see that list.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.828
There has to be more.
I'm expecting company.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.247
- (yelping)
- Uh...

05:32.415 --> 05:35.584
Asta, Bandit, Bowser, Fido, Fifi,
Hound of Baskerville,

05:35.752 --> 05:39.296
Pavlov's dog, Rex, Rover, Rufus,
Shatzi, Spot and...

05:39.464 --> 05:41.173
Itchy! Ho-ho!

05:41.341 --> 05:42.299
(Itchy yelling)

05:42.467 --> 05:44.092
Oh, yeah. Right.
He's right here on the list.

05:44.260 --> 05:48.889
- Where am I?
- You old fleabag, you.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.183
(grunting)

05:54.729 --> 05:56.772
Charlie, is that you?

05:56.939 --> 06:00.567
Charlie, it is you. Charlie.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.028
Gee, Itch, you shouldn't have.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.947
Sorry, sir, you can't take it with you.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.872
Wait a minute, ain't you dead?

06:14.040 --> 06:16.375
Oh, yeah,
as a dog that eats chicken bones.

06:16.542 --> 06:21.171
Oh, so that means... (stammering)

06:23.132 --> 06:24.716
Uh-oh!

06:24.884 --> 06:27.719
Welcome to paradise, Itch.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.807
Come on, I'll show you around.
You can mark your territory.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.103
(grunting)

06:38.106 --> 06:40.190
Hey, wait. Charlie.

06:51.244 --> 06:55.497
Oh, this is...
Well, I never would have imagined.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.665
(chuckles)

06:56.833 --> 06:58.208
Look at this.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.922
Hey, Charlie, wait a minute.
I'm not itchy.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.508
That's funny, you sure look like him.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.844
No, I mean...

07:09.011 --> 07:13.265
...for the first time in my life,
I don't need to scratch.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.893
This is heaven, Itch.
Fleas go to the other place.

07:17.061 --> 07:22.023
Hey, Bubba, how about we go down
to Hog Heaven and get us some ribs?

07:24.068 --> 07:26.194
Everybody's flying.

07:26.362 --> 07:29.406
Does that mean me too?

07:30.533 --> 07:33.493
Oh, yeah,
it's all part of the basic package.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.873
(laughs) I'm gonna like it here,
Charlie.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.460
Believe me, it gets old fast.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.171
Yeah, sure. Ha-ha-ha.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.548
Whoa! Yah! Hoo!

07:48.050 --> 07:50.760
- What do you mean?
- It's hard to explain, Itch.

07:50.928 --> 07:54.055
This joint is supposed
to have everything, to be the best,

07:54.223 --> 07:56.641
but it's just too...
I don't know, it's...

(muttering)

13:37.608 --> 13:39.943
(yelling)

13:45.616 --> 13:47.826
(Itchy) Charlie,
you're wrong about this place.

13:47.993 --> 13:52.288
The flying alone
is worth the price of admission.

13:52.456 --> 13:57.418
That's perfect for you, but for me,
there's still something missing.

13:57.586 --> 14:02.090
- (indistinct chatter)
- Ooh! Charlie, look, look.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.637
Quiet, quiet, quiet, everyone.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.765
- I've got terrible news.
- Oh, yeah, the flying nun.

14:10.933 --> 14:15.436
Gabriel's horn has fallen from heaven
and landed on Earth

14:15.604 --> 14:18.940
in the heart of San Francisco.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.568
(all gasp, mutter)

14:21.735 --> 14:24.988
But without the horn,
the Pearly Gates can't be opened.

14:25.155 --> 14:28.116
- And no more dogs will get into heaven.
- Lucky dogs.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.452
Reginald,
you're our most-decorated angel.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.955
I need you to go back to Earth

14:34.123 --> 14:35.623
- to retrieve it.
- Go back?

14:35.791 --> 14:39.252
(clears throat) Anabelle,
I would consider it a great...

14:39.420 --> 14:40.837
Whoa, time-out.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.131
- I beg your pardon.
- You can't send Reggie.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.258
Just look at him, for heaven's sake.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.886
They got rats down there
bigger than this.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.638
He's right. I'll go.

14:50.806 --> 14:55.226
We're talking the mean streets of Frisco
here, Ace, not Mount Happy-Go-Lucky.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.853
Send me, Ana...

14:57.021 --> 15:00.648
Anabelle, you're gonna need someone
who can zip down there and back

15:00.816 --> 15:03.109
before Big Gabe
finds his horn missing.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.320
Someone who knows the ropes
and the dopes.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.155
- Someone who's...
- Just like you.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.990
Me? Well, I don't know.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.493
I'd have to check with my people
and get back to you.

15:12.661 --> 15:15.204
Aw, what the heck. I'll do it.

15:15.372 --> 15:18.333
Maybe you can do something
besides make a nuisance of yourself.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.878
- Right, right, right. I'll be in touch.
- Hold it.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.505
To find the horn, follow your ears.

15:24.673 --> 15:29.469
It gives off a steady, heavenly tone
that only angels can hear.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.262
Only angels. Got it.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.640
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
You're on your own.

15:33.807 --> 15:38.937
I can give you one miracle
to be used only in an emergency.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.358
One per customer. Got it.

15:43.525 --> 15:47.362
Charles, Charles, Charles,
this is serious.

15:47.529 --> 15:52.700
If the horn falls into the wrong hands,
it could mean disaster for us all.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.536
You can count on Charles.

15:57.039 --> 16:01.501
Uh... Just to make sure,
I'm sending Itchy along with you.

16:01.669 --> 16:06.005
Oh, no. But I just got here.
Waitjust a sec.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.424
I still have death lag.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.303
(yelling)

16:12.471 --> 16:15.056
I remembered,
I have flying lessons after lunch.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.808
Bring back the horn, Charles,

16:16.976 --> 16:21.062
otherwise there'll be heaven to pay.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.730
(Charlie) Got it.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.071
(Itchy screaming)

16:34.743 --> 16:37.412
(screeching down street)

16:38.539 --> 16:43.084
Look at this mess, Itch.
Trash, exhaust fumes, graffiti.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.378
- We are home.
- (streetcar bell dings)

16:45.546 --> 16:48.089
- Whoa!
- (bell dings)

16:48.924 --> 16:51.592
- You're telling me.
- (sniffing)

16:51.760 --> 16:57.390
Halo. Double chili cheeseburger
with onions and pickles.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.809
Charlie, stay.

16:59.977 --> 17:04.771
Look, we find Gabriel's horn, and then
it's straight back to heaven, okay?

17:04.940 --> 17:06.773
What's the hurry, Itch?

17:06.942 --> 17:11.612
- Let's have some fun.
- Charlie, wait. Wiener dog here.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.531
Oh, my legs are short.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.159
(male dog) Now, let's hear it

32:49.175 --> 32:51.718
You're about to watch a master.

32:53.721 --> 32:55.847
- (gasps)
- You must hear this all the time,

32:56.891 --> 32:59.977
but you sing like an angel.

33:00.144 --> 33:04.272
- Excuse me.
- The name's Barkin, Charlie Barkin.

33:04.440 --> 33:08.068
- And you are...?
- Not even remotely interested.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.195
- Oh, that's a mouthful.
- Down, boy.

33:10.363 --> 33:12.489
- Let me help with that.
- I don't want a scene.

33:12.657 --> 33:15.492
- Give me that. No, please.
- It's no problem at all.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.536
(Charlie) Whoops!

33:19.455 --> 33:21.873
Hey, sister.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.208
No free eats.

33:24.419 --> 33:25.502
I'll take care of it.

33:25.670 --> 33:29.840
- Put it on Carface's tab.
- Okay.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.342
Now, where were...?

33:32.510 --> 33:34.094
Huh?

33:35.638 --> 33:37.806
(Itchy) Hey, Charlie,

33:37.974 --> 33:41.893
I noted how you swept the lady
off her feet.

33:42.061 --> 33:45.355
So I'm rusty.
Let's make a little home delivery.

33:48.443 --> 33:52.654
I'll never get back to heaven.
Oh, shucks.

33:57.785 --> 33:59.828
Something tells me
you're forgetting the horn.

33:59.996 --> 34:03.665
Would you take it easy? There's
plenty of time for that. Come on.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.960
Anabelle is not gonna
like this, Charlie.

34:20.808 --> 34:24.101
Hey, nice digs, huh, Itch?

34:25.313 --> 34:27.313
- (growling)
- Ah!

34:27.482 --> 34:28.648
(gasps)

34:28.815 --> 34:32.235
- You again? What do you want?
- You left your doggy bag.

34:32.402 --> 34:36.322
Oh, right. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

34:37.449 --> 34:38.992
There's more than enough.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.369
If you want some company,
we could stick around.

34:41.536 --> 34:44.998
- Sorry, I've got a kid.
- Uh...

34:45.166 --> 34:47.958
Yeah, well, I'm good with kids.

34:54.926 --> 34:59.262
- (yawns)
- Whoa, she's got a "kid" kid.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.848
Thanks, girl.

35:02.016 --> 35:04.434
(laughs) What did he do,
follow you home?

35:04.602 --> 35:08.939
- Ah! You can talk?
- Ooh! Please don't encourage him.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.065
- (screams)
- Whoa!

35:10.233 --> 35:11.525
He can understand you?

35:11.692 --> 35:13.652
- Of course he can.
- Holy cow.

35:13.820 --> 35:17.030
Holy dogs, actually.
I'm Charlie, he's Itchy.

35:17.198 --> 35:20.408
What's going on here?
And I want the truth.

35:20.576 --> 35:21.660
The truth?

35:21.828 --> 35:25.872
I'm an angel.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.791
- Oh, boy.
- (boy) Come on.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.377
- Somebody's playing a trick.
- (Charlie) Okay.

35:30.545 --> 35:35.132
Okay, if I'm not an angel,
how can I do this?

35:36.717 --> 35:39.177
- Ooh!
- (grunts)

35:39.345 --> 35:41.221
- (laughing)
- Oh!

35:41.389 --> 35:46.268
Wait a minute. Run, jump, fly.
What did I forget?

35:49.313 --> 35:52.732
Of course. Watch this, kid.

35:53.901 --> 35:56.528
- Ah!
- (Charlie) Please...

35:57.488 --> 35:59.239
...hold your applause.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.411
- Ta-da!
- Wow!

36:04.579 --> 36:06.163
That was the best trick
I've ever seen.

36:06.330 --> 36:09.332
- Trick?
- I do magic too.

36:12.753 --> 36:14.379
Give me the ball, boy.

36:17.675 --> 36:22.179
Wow, that was... That was... More. More.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.931
- The kid's good.
- Listen.

36:25.099 --> 36:29.269
- I could help him with his technique.
- Houdini, that little boy is lost.

36:29.437 --> 36:32.606
If you really wanna help him,
why don't you ask him where he lives?

36:32.773 --> 36:33.857
(Itchy laughing)

36:34.025 --> 36:38.403
- Charlie, look. It's a miracle.
- Why not ask him yourself?

36:38.571 --> 36:43.283
- Now, that would be a miracle.
- One miracle coming up.

36:48.456 --> 36:52.459
Ugh! Of all the arrogant, presumptuous,
egotistical mutts I've ever met...

36:52.627 --> 36:53.960
Now you talk.

36:54.962 --> 36:56.796
You must be an angel.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.258
Hey, Charlie, you used up your miracle.

37:00.426 --> 37:02.761
And that was supposed to be
for an emergency.

37:02.929 --> 37:06.598
- Seemed like an emergency to me.
- You must be my guardian angel.

37:06.766 --> 37:07.724
- Your what?
- Your what?

37:07.892 --> 37:09.809
My mom told me
everyone has a guardian angel.

37:09.977 --> 37:12.395
You're here because
I ran away from home, right?

37:12.563 --> 37:16.316
Uh, sure, right, kid.
We're gonna make some team, huh?

37:16.484 --> 37:19.236
- You mean you're not lost?
- Not anymore.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.321
I got my guardian angel.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.406
Hold it.
I wanna know why you ran away.

37:23.574 --> 37:26.618
- You tell her.
- This ought to be good.

37:26.786 --> 37:29.287
It's, uh... Um... Uh...

37:29.455 --> 37:30.747
You're having, uh...

37:31.707 --> 37:32.666
...kid problems?

37:32.833 --> 37:37.170
- Yeah, with my stepmom.
- Knew it. Yeah, I knew it.

37:37.338 --> 37:41.132
She wants me to call her Mom,
but she's not.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.509
I'm never going home again.

37:42.677 --> 37:45.136
So, what do you plan to do,
live on the street?

37:45.304 --> 37:49.516
Yep. And do my magic
at Cannery Square.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.435
- Tourists give you money.
- (Sasha) Now, you know that's silly.

37:52.603 --> 37:55.647
- Come on, tell me where you live.
- (boy) No.

37:55.815 --> 38:00.527
Okay, don't listen to me.
Listen to your guardian angel.

38:00.695 --> 38:04.239
David, Cannery Square
sounds like a good plan to me.

38:04.407 --> 38:08.368
- What? Don't listen to him.
- He's not ready to go home.

38:08.536 --> 38:14.040
- (Sasha) Come on, he's 8 years old.
- (Charlie) That's 56 in dog years.

38:14.208 --> 38:16.626
David, with your talent,
there's no telling where you'll end up.

38:16.794 --> 38:19.337
- Oh, please.
- No, no, you must have faith.

38:19.505 --> 38:23.717
Guardian angels move
in mysterious ways.

38:23.884 --> 38:27.470
- So we're off to Cannery Square?
- Not Cannery Square.

38:27.638 --> 38:30.598
- Easy Street.
- Yes!

38:31.267 --> 38:33.018
You with us, Sasha?

38:34.061 --> 38:37.522
I don't know what you're up to,
but I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

38:37.690 --> 38:41.067
I wouldn't want it any other way.

38:41.235 --> 38:42.736
(Anabelle) Charles!

38:43.904 --> 38:48.825
We've got a trafficjam up here.
New arrivals can't get in.

38:48.993 --> 38:51.161
We need that horn.

38:51.329 --> 38:55.206
Put them in a holding pattern, okay?
I'm really onto something down here.

38:55.374 --> 38:57.709
(Anabelle yelling)

39:07.094 --> 39:10.347
(Carface) You're gonna love this place,
boss. It's got everything you wanted.

39:10.514 --> 39:15.769
Beachfront location, fenced yard,
tight security.

39:16.979 --> 39:19.606
The joint's been home
to some great pedigrees.

39:20.608 --> 39:25.195
Capone, "Machine Gun" Kelly,
the Bird Dog ofAlcatraz.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.030
Ho-ho-ho!

39:27.198 --> 39:29.115
- Ah!
- (roars)

39:29.283 --> 39:34.621
- (rat squeals)
- All that and ratatouille too.

39:39.543 --> 39:41.503
Then I did good?

39:43.464 --> 39:45.298
Have a bone.

39:48.552 --> 39:51.888
(streetcar bell dinging)

39:55.893 --> 39:58.144
(David) Which way to Cannery Square?

39:58.312 --> 40:01.272
- (Charlie) Uh, just follow your nose.
- (jack-hammering)

40:01.440 --> 40:04.150
So is there a Mr. Sasha?

40:04.318 --> 40:06.820
No, and I'm not taking applications.

40:06.987 --> 40:09.406
Okay. Okay. But if you were,

40:09.573 --> 40:12.951
what, uh, what qualities
would you be looking for?

40:13.119 --> 40:17.831
- Oh, I don't know.
- Of course you do.

40:17.998 --> 40:19.666
Hm...

40:19.834 --> 40:24.754
Well, loyalty, strength, breeding...

40:24.922 --> 40:28.842
- I'd be good at that.
- ...humility,

40:33.681 --> 40:36.474
- ...and, of course, style.
- (Itchy laughs)

40:36.642 --> 40:38.351
Charlie, you okay?

40:38.519 --> 40:42.439
- Boy, are my ears ringing.
- Yeah, you're right.

40:42.606 --> 40:44.441
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

40:44.608 --> 40:49.529
That's not your ears, Charlie, that's...
Oh, that's gotta be the horn.

40:49.697 --> 40:52.699
- (fanfare playing)
- Look, Charlie, there it is.

40:54.368 --> 40:55.368
Go get it, Itch.

40:55.536 --> 40:57.954
I'll stay here with Sasha.

40:58.122 --> 41:01.958
Uh-uh. That's yourjob.
I'll stay with Sasha.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.251
(sighs)

41:03.419 --> 41:06.629
Okay. I'll be back
before you can say "Hallelujah."

41:06.797 --> 41:10.925
- Where's he going?
- Confidential guardian-angel business.

41:13.220 --> 41:17.640
(Red) You dogs have enjoyed
a state of grace for far too long.

41:17.808 --> 41:23.771
- Wouldn't you agree, Carface?
- Uh, yeah, whatever you say, boss.

41:23.939 --> 41:27.233
All these cells filled with dogs.

41:27.401 --> 41:31.529
- Can you see it?
- Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

41:31.697 --> 41:34.741
And me playing Gabriel's horn.

41:34.909 --> 41:36.409
- Can you hear it?
- Oh, sure.

41:36.577 --> 41:39.621
Just, uh,
put your lips together and blow.

41:40.331 --> 41:43.917
And then the grand finale!

41:44.793 --> 41:47.712
That ain't...
That's not coming in so clear, actually.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.256
Oh, it will.

41:50.424 --> 41:54.344
And all thanks to Charlie Barkin.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.887
(cackling)

41:56.639 --> 42:01.184
- Make sure he doesn't disappoint me.
- You got it, boss.

42:01.352 --> 42:04.854
♪ It's all so stirring
I feel like purring

42:05.022 --> 42:08.358
♪ It's deeply pleasing
to be the reason

42:08.526 --> 42:13.321
♪ So many will be so sad

42:14.657 --> 42:17.784
♪ Three cheers for treachery

42:17.952 --> 42:22.789
♪ It feels so good to be bad ♪

42:23.624 --> 42:25.166
A-ha!

42:28.128 --> 42:29.754
(man) Let's go.

42:30.089 --> 42:31.798
- All right, step through.
- Good boy.

42:31.966 --> 42:34.133
Hey, nice little dog there, isn't he?

42:52.319 --> 42:57.073
Get this, McDowell:
"Man finds genie in his vacuum cleaner."

42:57.241 --> 42:58.783
And last week, you believed
that scientists

42:58.951 --> 43:01.035
created intelligent lunchmeat.

43:01.203 --> 43:04.497
That's why everyone's afraid
to ride in a car with you.

43:04.665 --> 43:06.541
Hey, sarge,
you got a lost and found here?

43:06.709 --> 43:07.667
(belches)

43:07.835 --> 43:10.628
- Room 1 12, through the squad room.
- Ten-four.

43:10.796 --> 43:15.091
I'm telling you, McDowell, there are
some mighty weird things in this world.

43:24.810 --> 43:27.228
Any ideas why he ran away?

43:27.396 --> 43:30.523
- It could only be one thing.
- We're having a baby.

43:30.691 --> 43:33.610
And David got very upset
when I told him.

43:51.086 --> 43:53.921
(officer humming)

43:56.258 --> 43:57.550
Hm!

43:59.553 --> 44:01.054
(blows horn)

44:01.722 --> 44:02.889
Huh?

44:03.057 --> 44:04.724
Oh! Whoo!

44:05.726 --> 44:07.602
(laughs) I can't believe this.

44:12.733 --> 44:13.900
Where'd I put that lost-and-found list?

44:14.068 --> 44:17.236
Come on. Come to Charlie.

44:19.323 --> 44:21.991
- Oh! Ah!
- Huh?

44:22.159 --> 44:23.576
Oh...

44:24.244 --> 44:28.748
Of course it couldn't be Gabriel's flute
or Gabriel's kazoo, no.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.921
- (father) Thanks, Officer Reyes.
- (Reyes) Don't worry,

44:35.089 --> 44:37.298
we'll find your little boy.

44:41.929 --> 44:45.098
Itchy, where is he?
And what's this all about?

44:45.265 --> 44:48.434
Sorry, can't.
Charlie and I are sworn to secrecy.

44:48.602 --> 44:52.563
My lips, these lips right here,
see these lips? Well, they're sealed.

44:52.731 --> 44:55.817
- Itchy.
- (whimpering)

44:56.235 --> 44:59.445
- Miss me? Ooh!
- Charlie. (laughs)

44:59.613 --> 45:03.908
- So where's the you-know-what?
- Minor setback, Itch.

45:04.076 --> 45:06.536
We're just gonna have to bust it out.

45:06.704 --> 45:09.872
- It? What "it"?
- Charlie, no.

45:10.040 --> 45:15.086
- Well... Yah!
- Charlie, don't give away the "it."

45:15.462 --> 45:19.716
- You ever hear of Gabriel's horn?
- (muttering)

45:19.883 --> 45:21.300
All right, here's the plan.

45:21.468 --> 45:24.929
- (whispering)
- (chuckling)

45:26.724 --> 45:30.852
Just keep moving. Doing great.
Act like you belong here. That's right.

45:31.019 --> 45:32.687
Just through the door on the left.

45:33.939 --> 45:36.441
I don't think this is gonna work.

45:36.608 --> 45:39.986
Nobody even sees us. No eye contact.
Am I good or what?

45:42.406 --> 45:43.823
(dog growling)

45:43.991 --> 45:46.492
- (growling loudly)
- Ah!

45:46.660 --> 45:49.412
Don't you...
Don't you do that on those papers.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.706
(shouting, barking)

45:52.666 --> 45:54.751
Uh-oh. Plan B, guys.

45:55.335 --> 45:57.545
Doughnuts, fresh off the truck!

45:59.173 --> 46:01.215
(all shouting)

46:04.011 --> 46:05.970
(screams)

46:06.972 --> 46:10.683
- Somebody get those mutts!
- Hey, hey, come back here.

46:11.810 --> 46:16.355
Hey. Whoa! Get over here.
He's headed for the... Whoa!

46:20.694 --> 46:23.154
(Itchy) Oh, no. Excuse me.

46:23.322 --> 46:25.323
(babbling) Ooh!

46:25.491 --> 46:27.366
- I'll just file this.
- (alarm ringing)

46:27.534 --> 46:30.369
Whoa!

46:33.540 --> 46:35.208
(gurgling)

46:38.712 --> 46:45.718
(shouting)

46:48.555 --> 46:51.182
Oh! Oof! Ah!

46:51.350 --> 46:55.144
- Oops! Sorry, officer.
- Ha! We got you.

46:55.312 --> 46:57.897
(gurgling speech)
Okay, son, give me the keys.

46:58.065 --> 47:02.693
- You heard him, little man.
- Nothing up my sleeve, sir.

47:02.861 --> 47:07.073
- What?
- Officer, what's that behind your ear?

47:07.241 --> 47:10.326
Thank you, thank you.
You've been a great audience.

47:10.494 --> 47:12.745
(gurgling shouting)

47:14.248 --> 47:15.998
(grunting)

47:23.841 --> 47:26.425
Mission accomplished. Come on.

47:27.553 --> 47:29.262
- Ah!
- Oof!

47:29.429 --> 47:31.055
(muttering in Spanish)

47:31.223 --> 47:36.477
Oh, my gosh, David. David!

47:38.564 --> 47:41.357
Freeze. Sit. Stay.

47:48.448 --> 47:49.949
What the...?

47:51.410 --> 47:52.702
Move, move, move.

47:55.956 --> 47:57.957
- (Reyes) Stop that kid!
- What are you doing?

47:58.125 --> 48:00.710
- And those dogs on the scooter!
- Kick it, Charlie.

48:00.878 --> 48:02.920
(Reyes) You don't have a license!

48:05.924 --> 48:09.552
- (Itchy) Hey, short legs.
- (Reyes) Come back here!

48:09.720 --> 48:11.637
Ah! It's the dog pound for sure.

48:14.558 --> 48:17.602
- Whoa!
- (car starts)

48:17.769 --> 48:19.645
(screaming)

48:24.776 --> 48:26.986
Jump, Itch. Now!

48:27.154 --> 48:28.487
(Itchy screaming)

48:36.371 --> 48:37.997
(yelping)

48:38.165 --> 48:40.207
Yahoo!

48:41.168 --> 48:44.503
Whoa! Aren't guardian angels
supposed to protect people?

48:44.671 --> 48:47.006
Hey, it's my first day on the job.

48:54.973 --> 48:56.015
- (siren blaring)
- Ah!

49:08.236 --> 49:09.612
Whoa!

49:14.159 --> 49:15.993
I'm gonna barf.

49:16.745 --> 49:19.580
- Yee-ha!
- Having fun, are we?

49:27.547 --> 49:29.590
(screaming)

49:32.719 --> 49:35.054
- (screaming)
- (brakes squealing)

49:36.765 --> 49:39.350
(speaking Spanish)

49:42.229 --> 49:44.271
You finally got your flying lessons,
eh, Itch?

49:45.023 --> 49:48.609
(Itchy) I'm gonna get you
for this, Charlie.

50:00.580 --> 50:04.000
Aw, what do you mean,
we're not gonna go back yet?

50:04.167 --> 50:07.837
Look, we got the horn, don't we?
Come on, let's get out of here.

50:08.005 --> 50:11.924
I still need to take care of David.
I am his guardian angel.

50:12.092 --> 50:14.635
Oh, yeah, sure,
and Sasha has nothing to do with it.

50:14.803 --> 50:19.598
- Well, uh...
- Charlie, you're making me crazy here.

50:19.766 --> 50:22.143
Just a little more time.

50:27.190 --> 50:28.774
The horn'll be safe here.

50:29.901 --> 50:31.944
No. Charlie!

50:43.123 --> 50:45.458
Wouldn't you rather
be home right now, David?

50:45.625 --> 50:49.962
Uh-uh. Not that again.
I'm going to Cannery Square.

50:50.130 --> 50:54.800
- Don't you mean Easy Street?
- Yeah. How far is it?

50:54.968 --> 50:57.136
A lot closer than you think.

50:59.723 --> 51:01.766
(playing steel drums)

51:05.979 --> 51:08.647
- Nervous?
- A little. And sweaty.

51:08.815 --> 51:10.149
Well, don't be.

51:10.901 --> 51:12.943
- Excited?
- You bet.

51:15.655 --> 51:20.367
- Now, Charlie...
- It's okay. All set. Let's go.

My mom used to do that.

54:56.668 --> 55:00.337
Charlie, can she see me from heaven?

55:01.464 --> 55:04.216
- Of course she can, kiddo.
- (Sasha) David, remember,

55:04.384 --> 55:06.176
you still have
your dad and stepmom here.

55:06.344 --> 55:11.223
My stepmom doesn't want me.
She's having her own kid.

55:11.391 --> 55:13.726
But parents can love
more than one pup.

55:13.893 --> 55:16.145
Maybe she didn't know
how to tell you that.

55:16.313 --> 55:18.897
(Charlie) Maybe you should give her
another chance.

55:19.065 --> 55:22.067
You know, I ran away from home
when I was little.

55:22.235 --> 55:24.069
- That make your parents sorry?
- I don't know.

55:24.237 --> 55:26.363
I never saw them after that.

55:26.531 --> 55:30.117
(sighs) Guess I could've used
a guardian angel, huh?

55:30.285 --> 55:35.414
Charlie, I'll go home
if you promise to take me.

55:35.582 --> 55:39.918
- I promise.
- Really? It'll be great.

55:40.086 --> 55:42.921
You can sleep on my bed
and we'll play in the yard.

55:43.089 --> 55:45.174
We'll be one big family.

55:45.342 --> 55:48.385

You really are an angel.

No, I'm not.
Not a guardian angel, anyway.

56:30.762 --> 56:34.556
- What you did for David was wonderful.
- I'm not his angel.

56:34.724 --> 56:38.936
I'm just an errand boy
sent to fetch Gabriel's horn.

Sasha, my whole life has been about
making and breaking promises.

56:44.317 --> 56:48.570
- And now I'm gonna do it again.
- You can't take him home?

56:48.738 --> 56:50.614
I have to go back,

56:50.782 --> 56:53.742

He wouldn't leave.
He's my guardian angel.

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:28.165
Anything, Charlie, just name it.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:33.253
- I need a new collar.
- You enjoyed it.

01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:37.215
- I knew you would.
- Oh, thanks. You're a pal.

01:00:37.383 --> 01:00:40.802
- Can I have it now?
- Oh, I am sorry.

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:42.888
You misunderstood me.

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:47.059
If you want another collar,
you must pay.

01:00:47.226 --> 01:00:48.352
Oh. (laughs)

01:00:48.519 --> 01:00:52.522
You caught me a little short.
How about an IOU?

01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:57.235
I don't think so.
Carface will show you out.

01:00:57.403 --> 01:00:59.571
(Charlie) There must
be some way to make a deal.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.910
Charlie, he might take a trade.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:07.287
- Wait, wait.
- Goodbye.

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:12.626
Red, I have this horn.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:17.339
Sorry, I'm not musical.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:20.092
No, this is much more than a horn, Red.

01:01:20.259 --> 01:01:23.011
There's nothing like it
in the whole world.

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:25.430
Let me sleep on it.

01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:29.768
I don't have that kind of time.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:33.605
I like your spirit, Charlie.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:36.608
Bring me this horn
and you can have the collar.

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:41.196
Great. Uh, I need the collar to get it.

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:44.282
Oh, really?

01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:50.122
- Come on, Red, you can trust me.
- This isn't about trust.

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:54.126
A deal with me is binding.

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:59.131
- (Itchy) Charlie, no!
- (Red) Deal?

01:02:01.592 --> 01:02:04.469

01:02:04.637 --> 01:02:06.638

01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:20.902
(cackling)

01:02:21.362 --> 01:02:22.904
You tricked me.

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:27.659
Oh!

01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:32.831
Now, be a good little bow-wow,

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:36.042
and fetch me my horn.

01:02:36.627 --> 01:02:39.212
Oh, Charlie!

01:02:41.799 --> 01:02:43.341
Follow him.

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:01.485
(sniffing)

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:13.455
Where you going, Charlie?

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:16.541
The train station.

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:22.214
Oh! Charlie, are you nuts?

01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:25.383
- You... You gave away the horn.
- Get out of my way.

01:03:25.551 --> 01:03:28.470
You shook on it.
You made a deal with him.

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:32.766
You promised Anabelle
and you promised me, Charlie.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:37.813
Itch, I know that, but right now,
I've got to find David. Move.

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:45.987
- Come on, David. Which train?
- Where's Charlie?

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:48.448
He wouldn't leave me.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:50.909
Huh?

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.871
David? David?

01:03:55.039 --> 01:03:57.457
- A-ha!
- (muffled yelling)

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:08.927
Bring the item to Alcatraz
in one hour,

01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:14.224
orjunior here doesn't have a prayer.

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:15.892
(cackling)

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.353
Charlie!

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:24.609
(panting)

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:38.623
Where is he? The hour's up.

01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:42.752
You know what they say, boss,
"Patience is a..."

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.714
- (shouts)
- Oh!

01:04:47.091 --> 01:04:50.176
Uh... Maybe he's stuck in traffic.

01:04:50.344 --> 01:04:54.514
What kind of dog are you,
selling out to some mangy old cat?

01:04:54.682 --> 01:05:00.478
- Quiet, or I'll have your tongue, boy.
- (Charlie) Red.

01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:03.815
(Red) Charlie.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.278
The horn.

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:11.698
Let me, boss. I'll fetch it for you.

01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:13.992
(yelling)

01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:22.042
Gabriel's horn is finally mine.

01:05:22.627 --> 01:05:27.964
- Boss, they're hitting the bricks.
- (Red) Let them. I have what I want.

01:05:28.132 --> 01:05:32.177
(plays horn)

01:05:34.972 --> 01:05:37.474
(laughing)

01:05:37.642 --> 01:05:41.227
- (chuckling)
- Silence!

01:05:43.814 --> 01:05:47.442
- Huh?
- (howling)

01:05:48.819 --> 01:05:51.655
(plays horn)

01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:56.034
(cackling)

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:59.037
(plays horn)

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:01.581
(David) Charlie, what's happening?

01:06:01.749 --> 01:06:04.376
(Charlie) Don't worry about it.
Let's get out of here.

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:08.672
(plays horn)

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:14.594
(angels singing)

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.516
(metal creaking)

01:06:21.602 --> 01:06:22.852
(roars)

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:29.401
(yelling)

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.673
- Come on. Jump.
- Ah!

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:58.430
- Charles, what have you done?
- Charlie, we gotta do something.

01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:02.726
No, Itch, it's my fault.
I'm the one who's gotta do something.

01:07:02.893 --> 01:07:07.772
- Get David home safely.
- Charlie, no!

01:07:11.902 --> 01:07:13.945
- (roaring)
- Ah!

01:07:17.324 --> 01:07:19.200
(roaring)

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:39.763
(Carface) Red, Charlie's coming back.

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:43.099
(chuckles)

01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:45.643
(Red) That puppy's into punishment.

01:07:45.811 --> 01:07:47.312
(both grunting)

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.690
- Oof!
- (Red) It's a cat's world now.

01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:59.240
- Let him go!
- (Charlie) Run, David.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:04.662
- (screaming)
- Huh?

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.501
- No!
- David.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:15.131
- All right, you, I'm coming. Ah!
- Huh?

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:19.176
(Red) Which do you want,

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:23.014
the horn or your friends?

01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:26.350
(David) Itchy, help us!

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:31.731
(growling)

01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:37.694
(Charlie) Everyone, scatter!

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:43.076
(Red) Come back here. (roars)

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:47.705
Play the horn, Charles. The horn.

01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:53.545
(Red) Charlie.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:09:00.343
(growling)

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.273
(straining)

01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:19.946
This should cool him off.

01:09:22.741 --> 01:09:24.701
Take a bath.

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:36.212
(Red) Enough stupid pet tricks.

01:09:41.385 --> 01:09:42.926
Ha!

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:45.138
- (roaring)
- Ah!

01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:51.227
(growling) Huh?

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:54.522
Here, kitty, kitty.

01:09:56.775 --> 01:09:59.611
I like your spirit. Oops!

01:09:59.778 --> 01:10:00.862
(Charlie laughs)

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:05.617
- Hope you can dog paddle.
- Charlie!

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:12.749
(yelling)

01:10:16.503 --> 01:10:18.588
Ah!

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:29.891
(yelling)

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:37.315
(Charlie plays horn)

01:10:49.453 --> 01:10:50.745
(groaning)

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.962
(playing horn)

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:17.397
(Red screaming)

01:11:28.575 --> 01:11:31.369
Halo. (sniffing)

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:35.290
Double chili catburger
with onions and pickles.

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:37.458
- Everyone okay?
- Think so.

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:39.877
- I'm fine.
- I'm good.

01:11:40.045 --> 01:11:41.629
(Carface) Me too.

01:11:45.759 --> 01:11:49.053
- Where's Red?
- His boss yanked his leash.

01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:52.682
Ah! Good riddance. (coughs)

01:11:53.934 --> 01:11:57.895
Charlie, I hope you didn't
take any of that personally, you know?

01:11:58.063 --> 01:12:01.024
I was just, you know,
playing the game. (laughs)

01:12:01.191 --> 01:12:02.650
Sure, Carface.

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:04.986
Say, what did you trade Red
for your collar?

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:08.573
(Carface) He wanted the bottom of my
shoes or something. (laughs)

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:12.243
I don't even wear shoes,
that stupid cat.

01:12:12.411 --> 01:12:17.123
(Red) Stupid dog. It was your soul!

01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:19.208
Let me go.

01:12:20.544 --> 01:12:24.714
This is not good. Hey! Not the flames.

01:12:28.802 --> 01:12:33.598
(chuckles) What do you know.
And I thought all dogs go to heaven.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.103
Anabelle?

01:12:40.397 --> 01:12:44.525
- Come on, Charlie, time to go.
- Already?

01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:48.154
David, can Sasha take you home?

01:12:48.322 --> 01:12:50.782
Charlie, don't go.

01:12:52.242 --> 01:12:55.703
Hey, I'll always be your guardian angel.

01:12:56.997 --> 01:12:58.456
Okay.

01:13:07.966 --> 01:13:10.927
Sasha, I love you.

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:13.054
I love you too, Charlie.

01:13:22.981 --> 01:13:27.318
Hey, what's wrong?
Is this thing stuck between floors?

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:31.948
- I'll take the horn from here, Charles.
- What, you afraid I'll drop it?

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:35.493
(gasps) Ah! Whoa!

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:38.830
(sighs)

01:13:38.997 --> 01:13:43.084
There's someone who still needs
to go back where he belongs.

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:47.839
- I already took care of David.
- Not David. You, Charlie.

01:13:48.006 --> 01:13:52.176
For what you've done,
you deserve a second chance.

01:13:52.344 --> 01:13:56.347
Claim this in, oh, say, 20 years.
(giggles)

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:59.434
- You mean...?
- Mm-hm.

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:03.855
Itchy, you hear that?
We're going back.

01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:08.443
Nah. Not this wiener dog.
See, when you can fly...

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:15.700
...short legs don't matter. (laughs)

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:19.495
I'm gonna miss you, pal.

01:14:19.663 --> 01:14:23.958
I couldn't have done it without you.
Take care of yourself, buddy.

01:14:42.394 --> 01:14:44.061
What is it, girl?

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:59.035
Can you believe it?

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:01.204
- Charlie.
- Charlie?

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:06.501
I got a weekend pass
for the rest of my life.

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:10.087
- Oh, Charlie.
- David?

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:14.592
- Thom, it's David.
- Davey!

01:15:16.094 --> 01:15:18.137
Oh, David.

01:15:20.599 --> 01:15:22.266
You're all right.

01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:28.105
I've been worried sick about you.

01:15:28.273 --> 01:15:30.608
- You worried about me?
- Of course.

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:34.278
Having this baby doesn't mean
I don't love you.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.575
- I know that now, Mom.
- Honey, we're a family.

01:15:39.743 --> 01:15:42.787
That's right, just a bigger one.

01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:47.166
Dad, Mom,

01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:50.795
speaking of bigger families, you think
we have room for a pet or two?

01:15:50.963 --> 01:15:54.465
Now, tell me the truth, Charlie Barkin,
why'd you really come back?

01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:57.134
And don't you con me.

01:15:57.302 --> 01:16:02.265
Actually, I kind of like the idea
of being Mr. Sasha.

01:16:05.018 --> 01:16:09.313
