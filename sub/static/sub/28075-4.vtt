WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:03.616
I love days where I don't have to work

00:03.648 --> 00:06.007
and I can just run errands
and look like trash.

00:06.101 --> 00:07.650
I know. I'm not even wearing underwear.

00:07.683 --> 00:08.690
Yeah, me neither.

00:08.730 --> 00:10.394
I mean, I'm not seeing anybody I know,

00:10.441 --> 00:11.507
so why would I?

00:11.576 --> 00:12.605
I actually probably should.

00:12.688 --> 00:15.524
My dick always pops out of these pants.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.747
Ugh, I hate walking around
with toilet paper.

00:17.816 --> 00:19.126
It's so embarrassing.

00:19.165 --> 00:20.850
Why? Everyone knows you have a butthole

00:20.919 --> 00:22.384
and poop comes out of it.

00:22.453 --> 00:24.130
Hey, you're okay.

00:24.193 --> 00:25.426
See? She agrees.

00:25.495 --> 00:27.861
Hey, gay.

00:27.930 --> 00:29.730
Huh, not sure
that's about your butthole.

00:29.798 --> 00:31.232
But, I mean, I guess kinda?

00:31.300 --> 00:32.566
Wait, what is going on?

00:32.634 --> 00:34.535
Hey, you're the guy from that video.

00:34.604 --> 00:37.204
Oh, no, sorry. I don't think so.

00:37.273 --> 00:38.395
Yeah, the little kid's music video

00:38.466 --> 00:39.663
about his gay brother.

00:39.708 --> 00:40.841
What?

00:40.909 --> 00:43.777
Oh, um, Care, look at this.

00:43.846 --> 00:46.380
I think I found

01:45.272 --> 01:46.371
Where is Streeter?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.273
Why is no one picking up? Ugh.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.674
Okay, can we just take one sec

01:49.744 --> 01:51.576
and laugh about how funny this is?

01:51.645 --> 01:54.412
I can't be in a teen's music video.

01:54.481 --> 01:55.914
Do I just show up at the label

01:55.983 --> 01:58.283
and tell that Shuli woman
to take it down?

01:58.352 --> 02:00.017
Yeah, yeah, that's what I got to do.

02:00.086 --> 02:01.485
Okay, or you leave it up

02:01.554 --> 02:03.221
and you get, like,
a trillion new followers.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.989
Ew, I don't want those followers.

02:05.058 --> 02:08.324
They're all like @ChaseDreamsFeet.

02:08.394 --> 02:09.926
Wow, he is getting famous.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.863
What if casting people see this?

02:11.931 --> 02:13.597
Oh, my God, what if Grandma sees this?

02:13.666 --> 02:15.699
Wait, does Grandma
not know that you're gay?

02:15.769 --> 02:17.368
No, she's 85.

02:17.436 --> 02:19.203
I thought I'd just let her die in peace

02:19.272 --> 02:21.038
without ever truly knowing who I am.

02:21.107 --> 02:22.917
Wow, cool brain, Care.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.710
Shuli, the video's at 5 mil.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.380
Great, can we get him on the OUT100 yet?

02:29.448 --> 02:31.482
No, they said it's still
just for gay people.

02:31.550 --> 02:32.716
God, that is so unfair.

02:33.986 --> 02:34.918
Hey, uh, Shuli?

02:36.422 --> 02:37.688
Hi, gay brother.

02:37.757 --> 02:39.423
You know, my brother's gay.

02:39.448 --> 02:40.468
I have a gay brother.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.480
My brother's gay too.

02:41.505 --> 02:42.726
Yes, okay,

02:42.795 --> 02:44.662
that's sort of why I'm here.

02:44.723 --> 02:45.729
Can I talk to you in private?

02:45.798 --> 02:47.431
One sec. Brooke, where have you been?

02:47.500 --> 02:48.999
Chase needs his assistant.

02:49.067 --> 02:51.101
Oh, um, I just sort of figured

02:51.170 --> 02:52.969
when you started
a new job you had a few days

02:53.038 --> 02:55.138
to, you know, get your life together.

02:55.207 --> 02:56.540
Why would you think that?

02:56.603 --> 02:58.509
Sorry, Shuli, can we talk, like, now?

02:58.577 --> 03:01.312
It's very important, and
I can't get ahold of Streeter.

03:01.380 --> 03:02.446
No one's told you.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.214
There was an emergency.

03:04.283 --> 03:06.850
Streeter and your mom had
to take Chase to a specialist.

03:06.919 --> 03:08.718
Oh, my God, what happened?

03:10.055 --> 03:11.722
You may want to sit for this.

03:15.327 --> 03:17.060
Chase has a...

03:18.463 --> 03:20.609
- a pimple.
- Ugh.

03:22.467 --> 03:23.766
A pimple?

03:23.836 --> 03:26.336
Look, if you need
to barf, go ahead. I did.

03:26.404 --> 03:27.838
But we're gonna get through this

03:27.906 --> 03:28.939
as... as a team.

03:29.007 --> 03:30.045
You know, we just may have

03:30.092 --> 03:32.843
to transition him to sexy
sooner than we thought.

03:32.911 --> 03:35.185
- Okay, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
- Trademark.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.112
I want that video down, all right?

03:37.181 --> 03:40.082
It's humiliating, and I feel exposed.

03:40.151 --> 03:41.150
- Your dick's out.
- Oh.

03:41.219 --> 03:43.152
Cary, what's the problem?

03:43.221 --> 03:45.020
Everyone here loves the video.

03:45.089 --> 03:47.323
I mean, its message is so strategic,

03:47.392 --> 03:49.158
important. I said important.

03:49.227 --> 03:50.993
And the gay community is eating it up.

03:51.062 --> 03:52.262
Ellen just tweeted about it.

03:53.398 --> 03:54.474
We got Ellen

03:54.545 --> 03:56.232
or whatever little twink
runs her account.

03:56.308 --> 03:57.675
Okay, well, I want it down.

03:57.736 --> 03:59.732
I'm an actor and this could be...

03:59.802 --> 04:01.871
...terrible for my career.

04:01.939 --> 04:03.406
Sorry.

04:05.943 --> 04:07.877
It's an agent asking
if I have representation.

04:07.945 --> 04:09.678
I guess she saw the video.

04:09.747 --> 04:12.041
Shit, this is one
of the biggest agencies.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.448
Care, that's amazing.

04:13.517 --> 04:15.684
Yeah, I could maybe leave Skip finally.

04:15.753 --> 04:17.786
Yeah.

04:17.855 --> 04:20.856
So like I was saying, I love the video.

04:20.925 --> 04:21.957
It's awesome.

04:22.026 --> 04:23.225
I want you guys to keep it up.

04:23.294 --> 04:27.196
I love you cuties. Thank you.

04:27.265 --> 04:29.664
All right, so I guess
I better get to work.

04:29.733 --> 04:31.700
All I'm gonna need from
you guys is Beyoncé's cell.

04:31.769 --> 04:34.069
Gotta set up a collab on,
you know, like, a song,

04:34.138 --> 04:35.337
ooh, or a jean.

04:35.406 --> 04:36.671
That's not your job.

04:36.740 --> 04:39.308
We have you in a very small office

04:39.377 --> 04:41.243
responding to fan mail.

04:41.312 --> 04:43.077
Shouldn't I be doing
something more creative?

04:43.146 --> 04:45.179
I mean, come on, with my background?

04:45.248 --> 04:46.915
What is your background?

04:46.983 --> 04:49.150
I went to the School of
American Ballet 11 years ago.

04:49.219 --> 04:50.618
Well, then no.

04:50.686 --> 04:52.954
Listen, Brooke,
your brother's fans love him

04:53.023 --> 04:54.455
because he's real.

04:54.524 --> 04:56.524
But now he's getting
too busy to be real,

04:56.592 --> 04:59.193
so we need you to be real for him.

04:59.262 --> 05:00.861
Shuli, we have a problem.

05:00.931 --> 05:02.163
The gays are turning on the vid.

05:02.232 --> 05:06.206
They're saying it's, quote,
"so five years ago."

05:07.337 --> 05:09.214
That's the worst thing you can be.

05:09.260 --> 05:10.759
<i>"Dear ChaseDreams,</i>

05:10.831 --> 05:12.506
<i>"I've been in the hospital
for seven weeks</i>

05:12.575 --> 05:14.208
<i>"and it's not looking good.</i>

05:14.277 --> 05:15.709
<i>"Could you send me a T-shirt?</i>

05:15.778 --> 05:17.610
<i>"You're my favorite singer ever.</i>

05:17.679 --> 05:19.212
<i>Love, Rachel Klein."</i>

05:19.281 --> 05:20.347
Poor girl.

05:20.416 --> 05:23.083
Such terrible taste in music.

05:23.152 --> 05:24.584
Hey, how's it going in here?

05:24.653 --> 05:26.954
Oh, some of these letters
are really intense.

05:27.022 --> 05:29.423
A grown woman sent Chase underwear.

05:29.491 --> 05:31.758
That happens a lot.
You can just toss 'em.

05:31.827 --> 05:33.801
Oh, I mean, can't waste
brand-new underwear.

05:33.863 --> 05:35.895
- Am I right, girl?
- Those are not brand-new.

05:35.965 --> 05:37.597
Women wear them and send them dirty.

05:37.666 --> 05:38.665
Don't even touch them.

05:38.733 --> 05:40.500
Of course not.

05:40.569 --> 05:41.634
And don't eat any of the food.

05:41.703 --> 05:43.170
Uh-huh.

05:43.238 --> 05:44.804
Anyway, Shuli wanted me

05:44.873 --> 05:46.573
to introduce you to Chase's lawyers.

05:46.641 --> 05:48.442
There's, like, 100 of them,
and they're all, like, 25.

05:48.510 --> 05:50.477
Yeah, I'll go meet some lawyers.

05:50.545 --> 05:52.445
Oh, I'm sorry, I meant
there's 25 of them,

05:52.514 --> 05:53.613
and they're all, like, 100.

05:53.682 --> 05:56.583
Mm, um, you know, I'm actually...

05:56.651 --> 06:00.587
I'm in the middle of some
very important fan outreach.

06:00.655 --> 06:02.121
Yeah, there's a sick girl.

06:02.190 --> 06:03.656
She's dying, actually.

06:03.725 --> 06:08.628
So I need to personally
bring her a Chase T-shirt.

06:08.697 --> 06:11.063
So off I go.

06:11.132 --> 06:15.001
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

06:17.038 --> 06:21.307
I have a meeting with an agent.

06:21.376 --> 06:23.275
We all do. This is an agency.

06:23.344 --> 06:25.110
- Cary?
- Yes.

06:25.178 --> 06:26.778
Oh, Pitzi Pyle.

06:26.847 --> 06:28.079
Thank you so much for coming in.

06:28.148 --> 06:29.447
I saw you in the vid.

06:29.517 --> 06:31.517
I am gagging for you, faggot.

06:31.585 --> 06:33.496
Come on back.

06:36.770 --> 06:38.473
Sorry, I was... uh, I was gonna change,

06:38.544 --> 06:40.739
but you told me to come down here ASAPF,

06:40.793 --> 06:42.525
I thought the F was a typo,

06:42.588 --> 06:44.950
but now I think I know
what it stands for.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.138
Yas, faggot.

06:47.206 --> 06:50.808
Wait, should we do this meeting
here or while we're shopping?

06:50.877 --> 06:53.310
I guess here?

06:53.379 --> 06:55.647
Aw, Pitzi sad.

06:55.715 --> 06:57.515
Oh, oh, no.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.250
I'm sorry, we can...

06:59.318 --> 07:00.852
Wait, you believed me.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.820
Oh, my God. You're so cute.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.488
You're, like, the sweetest
person I've ever met.

07:04.557 --> 07:06.056
Like, will you be my best friend?

07:06.125 --> 07:07.824
Like, legally, we're bound
to be best friends now.

07:07.893 --> 07:10.293
And that's really good for you
because I'm the top agent here.

07:10.362 --> 07:11.762
- Oh, you are?
- Yeah.

07:11.830 --> 07:13.429
I have the most clients, okay, 10,000.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.701
- Oh, how is that manageable?
- But enough about me.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.069
Okay, dish. I want to hear everything.

07:19.138 --> 07:20.270
Where are you from? What's your deal?

07:20.338 --> 07:21.504
What makes you tic? Everything.

07:21.573 --> 07:23.540
Well, I'm from Ohio,

07:23.608 --> 07:25.542
uh, like all the greats.

07:28.380 --> 07:29.880
Oh, my God, wait.

07:29.948 --> 07:31.481
So you're, like, the funniest
person that ever lived.

07:31.550 --> 07:32.783
Okay, I'm obsessed with you.

07:32.851 --> 07:34.284
Josh, get in here!
You have to hear this.

07:34.352 --> 07:35.618
He's gonna love this.

07:35.688 --> 07:37.921
Okay, Cary, tell Josh where you're from.

07:37.990 --> 07:40.223
Ohio.

07:40.292 --> 07:41.691
But do the other part.

07:41.759 --> 07:44.226
It's... it's where
all the greats are from.

07:47.438 --> 07:49.530
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

07:52.570 --> 07:55.104
Hi, I'm looking for a patient
named Rachel Kline.

07:55.173 --> 07:56.806
She's here and dying.

07:56.874 --> 07:59.175
Okay, that's not how we
talk out loud in a hospital.

07:59.243 --> 08:01.410
Are you family or celebrity?

08:01.478 --> 08:04.113
Oh, um, celebrity?

08:04.182 --> 08:06.742
Okay, we're actually already
checking on that name for P!nk,

08:06.812 --> 08:09.852
so you can go ahead and have
a seat next to her assistant.

08:09.921 --> 08:11.398
Which one is her...

08:15.192 --> 08:16.591
I found her.

08:21.297 --> 08:23.631
Wow, you look exactly like P!nk.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.867
It's like dogs and their owners.

08:25.936 --> 08:27.836
This was me when I first started.

08:27.904 --> 08:29.104
Whoa, when is that?

08:29.172 --> 08:30.471
Four weeks ago.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.107
You don't look like anyone famous.

08:32.174 --> 08:33.474
Did you just start?

08:33.543 --> 08:35.275
Oh, today's my first day, actually.

08:35.345 --> 08:37.111
Well, let me give you some advice.

08:37.179 --> 08:39.780
Never let your boss
get into aerial gymnastics.

08:39.850 --> 08:41.116
Oh, don't worry.

08:41.183 --> 08:42.416
I'm not gonna be an assistant for long.

08:42.485 --> 08:45.563
- It's not like a career or anything.
- Your loss.

08:45.649 --> 08:48.641
P!nk's first assistant is now
the CEO of her apparel company.

08:48.719 --> 08:50.518
Whoa, really?

08:50.587 --> 08:52.554
I mean, it's just leotards
for aerial gymnastics,

08:52.622 --> 08:54.689
but she's rich.

08:54.758 --> 08:56.524
Sorry, ladies, there's no patient here

08:56.593 --> 08:58.693
by the name of Rachel Kline.

08:58.762 --> 09:00.395
What?

09:00.464 --> 09:03.030
Oh, I want to talk career with you.

09:03.099 --> 09:06.033
Okay, do you know who Meryl Streep is?

09:06.102 --> 09:07.301
- Yes.
- I don't. I don't.

09:07.371 --> 09:08.737
Because she's old, and old is bad.

09:08.805 --> 09:10.204
Okay, young is good.

09:10.273 --> 09:12.240
Do you know how many views
your video has?

09:12.308 --> 09:14.342
15 million!

09:14.411 --> 09:15.510
- It does?
- Yeah.

09:15.579 --> 09:16.778
And that means I can make you

09:16.847 --> 09:19.781
the most famous person in the world...

09:19.850 --> 09:21.215
For the next 14 hours.

09:22.753 --> 09:24.385
Well, you know, uh,
I think I'm looking for

09:24.453 --> 09:26.187
a little bit more longevity than that.

09:26.256 --> 09:29.323
I guess I just want, like, a...
you know, maybe a small part

09:29.384 --> 09:32.385
in a miniseries, or, you know,
a role in a...

09:32.461 --> 09:34.491
director's...

09:36.028 --> 09:37.160
Hello?

09:41.070 --> 09:44.305
Hey, Shuli, it's Cary.
Listen, I changed my mind.

09:44.374 --> 09:46.340
I'm actually gonna need
that video to come down.

09:46.409 --> 09:47.745
No can do, Care.

09:47.815 --> 09:51.412
Tomi Lahren just called it
an affront to family values.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.247
The gays are back on board.

09:56.319 --> 09:57.451
Wait, I'm sorry.

09:57.520 --> 09:58.785
Why isn't there a Rachel Kline here?

09:58.853 --> 10:00.620
This happens all the time.

10:00.688 --> 10:03.723
It's a dude, some middle-aged
perv who wants attention.

10:03.792 --> 10:06.592
Ew, but then why would he
pretend to be in a hospital?

10:06.661 --> 10:08.194
They don't think anyone
will actually show.

10:08.263 --> 10:09.595
They just hope you feel bad enough

10:09.664 --> 10:11.531
to send a bunch
of free crap to their house

10:11.599 --> 10:13.300
probably so they can jack off into it.

10:13.325 --> 10:14.267
Ugh.

10:14.336 --> 10:16.903
Check the return address.

10:16.972 --> 10:19.072
It says New Jersey.

10:19.141 --> 10:21.541
Exactly, where the pervs live.

10:21.609 --> 10:22.708
Okay, but if this keeps happening,

10:22.777 --> 10:23.988
why do you keep showing up?

10:24.058 --> 10:26.279
Because one time out of ten
it really is a dying girl,

10:26.348 --> 10:28.714
and if you don't show up,
it's bad optics.

10:28.783 --> 10:30.650
And P!nk doesn't do bad optics.

10:30.718 --> 10:34.219
She does near constant
aerial gymnastics.

10:34.288 --> 10:36.489
Well, I'm gonna go to New Jersey

10:36.558 --> 10:39.358
and I'm gonna confront this sick perv.

10:39.427 --> 10:40.426
You want to come?

10:40.495 --> 10:41.761
No, I have to find

10:41.830 --> 10:43.128
some other dying kid
to take a photo with.

10:43.197 --> 10:45.331
Oh.

10:45.399 --> 10:48.634
<i>♪ Haters may hate

10:48.703 --> 10:50.570
Hey, are you from that music video?

10:50.638 --> 10:51.904
Oh, um, yes,

10:51.973 --> 10:53.372
but I'd love to do a miniseries one day,

10:53.441 --> 10:56.008
- like a "Fargo" or something.
- Oh, that's cool.

10:56.077 --> 11:00.212
Um, I just wanted to say
I came out to my mom today

11:00.281 --> 11:01.781
sort of because of that video.

11:01.850 --> 11:03.716
- Oh.
- I was scared,

11:03.785 --> 11:06.953
but it actually wasn't as bad
as I thought it was gonna be.

11:07.021 --> 11:10.807
So I guess this is weird,
but, um, thanks?

11:12.226 --> 11:14.994
That's... wow, that's... that's nice.

11:15.062 --> 11:17.829
Can I, um... can I give you
a hug or something?

11:17.854 --> 11:18.966
Sure.

11:20.901 --> 11:23.223
- Okay, see ya.
- Bye.

11:23.270 --> 11:25.201
And good luck with your miniseries.

11:25.739 --> 11:27.607
Thanks.

11:31.278 --> 11:32.611
- Shuli.
<i>- Hey, Shuli,</i>

11:32.679 --> 11:34.446
I guess you could leave the video up.

11:34.515 --> 11:36.281
Uh, I'm okay with it now.

11:36.350 --> 11:38.350
Too bad, Care. It's coming down.

11:38.419 --> 11:41.653
The A.V. Club just said
it's "no 'Moonlight.'"

11:41.722 --> 11:43.321
Was it supposed to be?

11:43.390 --> 11:44.655
It doesn't matter, Cary!

11:44.724 --> 11:47.191
They said it, and now we're fucked!

11:51.097 --> 11:52.397
He... hello.

11:52.465 --> 11:54.098
Just what I thought, a pervert.

11:54.167 --> 11:55.466
Excuse me?

11:55.535 --> 11:57.435
You think you are so smart,

11:57.504 --> 11:59.303
pretending to be a dying girl so what?

11:59.372 --> 12:02.740
A teen will send you a T-shirt
and you can nut in it?

12:02.808 --> 12:05.276
Well, here's your little tee, perv.

12:05.345 --> 12:08.079
Nut away.

12:08.148 --> 12:10.881
Oh, yeah, you should cry.

12:10.950 --> 12:14.785
Oh, good, all your little
pervert friends are crying too.

12:14.854 --> 12:18.188
And they're all in black.

12:20.625 --> 12:23.560
So Rachel wasn't
at the... because she...

12:26.432 --> 12:29.666
I am so sorry

12:29.734 --> 12:31.000

Am I doing it wrong?

13:30.426 --> 13:32.559
No, no, no, no. That was...

13:32.625 --> 13:33.671
That was great, um...

13:33.696 --> 13:35.196
I mean, it was a little dry.

13:35.264 --> 13:37.031
It was kind of like
a turtle eating a carrot.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.967
But that's not, uh...
that's not the problem.

13:42.138 --> 13:43.637
I can't do this anymore.

13:43.706 --> 13:45.706
Oh, okay.

13:45.774 --> 13:51.411
'Cause every time we do this,
it's great or whatever,

13:51.480 --> 13:54.948
but I just feel like shit after.

13:55.016 --> 13:57.779
Oh, no. You do? Why?

13:57.881 --> 14:02.083
Because you don't actually like me.

14:02.152 --> 14:05.726
And that makes me feel pathetic, okay?

14:05.796 --> 14:06.814
And I'm not pathetic.

14:06.890 --> 14:08.524
I'm a gay icon.

14:08.592 --> 14:10.192
Whoa, hey, that's cool.

14:10.260 --> 14:11.327
- Yeah.
- Since when?

14:11.395 --> 14:13.629
This morning. Yeah.

14:13.698 --> 14:17.064
And I don't know if you're secretly gay

14:17.133 --> 14:19.233
or if you're just straight
and you like attention,

14:19.302 --> 14:22.203
but either way, it fucking sucks for me.

14:22.271 --> 14:24.572
This sucks for me, and "Survivor" sucks.

14:24.641 --> 14:26.173
"Survivor" sucks.

14:26.242 --> 14:28.008
I can't believe you watch
the same seasons

14:28.077 --> 14:30.025
over and over and over.

14:30.072 --> 14:32.613
- It's the same thing.
- Well, not Micronesia.

14:32.682 --> 14:34.281
Okay, yeah, that season
did change the game, but...

14:34.351 --> 14:37.618
Listen, I... I'm sorry, Care.

14:37.687 --> 14:39.821
I...

14:39.889 --> 14:41.522
I love you, man.

14:41.591 --> 14:42.857
No, that's so annoying.

14:42.925 --> 14:43.958
No, you don't.

14:44.026 --> 14:45.359
You don't love me,

14:45.437 --> 14:49.696
and you know what's humiliating
is, I weirdly love you,

14:49.765 --> 14:55.034
and that is so dumb because you
never give me anything ever!

14:55.103 --> 14:56.503
Nothing!

14:56.572 --> 14:58.905
So from now on, we're just roommates.

14:58.974 --> 15:00.874
That's it, and when you watch TV,

15:00.942 --> 15:05.379
I need you to wear a shirt,
preferably a turtleneck.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.647
- Okay, all right.
- Thank you.

15:07.716 --> 15:10.584
Now if you'll excuse me,

15:10.652 --> 15:14.821
I have something I've been
meaning to do for eight months.

Halloween boxer shorts.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.884
Excuse me.

15:44.952 --> 15:47.920
How do you know the deceased?

15:47.988 --> 15:50.456
Oh, she was a big fan
of my little brother's,

15:50.525 --> 15:53.626
and I'm here on his behalf
because he loved her.

15:53.694 --> 15:56.128
He respected her,

15:56.196 --> 15:59.197
and he...

15:59.266 --> 16:01.967
Wait, I'm sorry, who's this bitch?

16:02.036 --> 16:03.402
The deceased.

16:03.470 --> 16:05.270
Grandma Elaine.

16:05.339 --> 16:08.240
So she wrote the letter?

16:08.309 --> 16:10.909
Okay, I'm sorry.

16:10.978 --> 16:13.078
I don't mean to speak ill of the dead,

16:13.147 --> 16:15.814
but that woman was a sex pervert.

16:16.883 --> 16:19.851
Yeah, she pretended to be
this little girl named Rachel Kline

16:19.920 --> 16:22.087
so that my brother
would send her a T-shirt

16:22.156 --> 16:23.922
so she could, I don't know,

16:23.991 --> 16:25.190
rub it all over her old titties.

16:25.259 --> 16:27.592
- Oh.
- Gross.

16:27.661 --> 16:29.658
Wait, I'm Rachel Kline.

16:31.531 --> 16:32.729
Sorry, what?

16:32.798 --> 16:34.198
I wrote that letter to Chase

16:34.267 --> 16:36.633
'cause I was at the hospital
with my grandma

16:36.702 --> 16:38.402
and I was sad, so I wanted a T-shirt.

16:45.578 --> 16:47.644
So today is my first day
in the industry,

16:47.713 --> 16:50.848
and I would like to apologize
for everything

16:50.916 --> 16:55.186
that I have said and done.

16:55.254 --> 16:57.488
Rachel, how do I make it up to you?

16:57.556 --> 17:02.093
Do you want Chase's autograph,
my autograph?

17:03.174 --> 17:06.730
Well, I have a school dance next week.

17:06.799 --> 17:10.032
Maybe Chase could be my date?

17:11.036 --> 17:12.502
Shuli, great news.

17:12.569 --> 17:13.903
The gays are back on board.

17:13.976 --> 17:15.098
What? How?

17:15.184 --> 17:17.673
Countess Luann just posted
an emotional response to it.

17:17.742 --> 17:18.974
From the "Real Housewives"?

17:19.044 --> 17:20.542
Oh, my God. Do you know what this means?

17:20.612 --> 17:23.480
Our video is officially camp.

17:27.152 --> 17:29.152
Give me these, yes.

17:29.221 --> 17:32.155
Sorry, just, uh, grabbing
my, uh, toilet paper here.

17:32.224 --> 17:33.490
I forgot it.

17:33.558 --> 17:35.291
And I know this seems like a lot,

17:35.360 --> 17:37.160
but it lasts me, like,
three months, so...

17:37.229 --> 17:38.328
Relax, Cary.

17:38.397 --> 17:40.030
It's time to celebrate.

17:40.098 --> 17:41.497
You're camp.

17:43.300 --> 17:45.200
You're gonna live on
forever in the gay community

17:45.269 --> 17:48.237
as a joke, something the gays
laugh at but also love,

17:48.305 --> 17:49.438
like Britney.

17:49.507 --> 17:50.706
Okay.

17:50.775 --> 17:52.341
Cool, what are we celebrating?

17:52.410 --> 17:53.809
Nothing, fun's over.

17:53.878 --> 17:55.811
Okay, look, we have the gays,

17:55.880 --> 17:57.212
but now we need to swing back

17:57.281 --> 17:59.348
and get the regular people again.

17:59.417 --> 18:00.850
- So boring.
- Ugh, lame.

18:00.919 --> 18:02.104
So how do we get them?

18:02.190 --> 18:05.254
We gotta do something sweet,
something wholesome.

18:05.322 --> 18:07.023
Maybe Chase could perform
at a cancer charity.

18:07.091 --> 18:08.490
Yeah, that's perfect.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.526
Chase said that his dad died of cancer.

18:10.595 --> 18:12.161
Oh, shit, that is what Mom told him.

18:12.229 --> 18:13.395
Should we tell them that's not true?

18:13.464 --> 18:15.263
Gay then cancer?

18:15.331 --> 18:18.466
We can't do two sad things
back to back, come on.

18:18.535 --> 18:19.834
Two sad things?

18:19.903 --> 18:21.402
Come on, more ideas, people.

18:21.471 --> 18:23.204
Something that will appeal
to middle America,

18:23.273 --> 18:26.875
you know, like football,
families, fields, corn.

18:26.944 --> 18:29.744
Oh, Chase could post
a picture eating corn.

18:29.813 --> 18:32.581
Not actual corn, Renee.

18:32.649 --> 18:34.153
You're fired. Get me a new Renee.

18:37.253 --> 18:39.187
Uh, maybe he could go to a school dance

18:39.255 --> 18:42.523
with a sweet, suburban teen?

18:42.593 --> 18:44.726
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

18:44.795 --> 18:48.029
If Chase goes to a dance
with one small-town girl,

18:48.098 --> 18:51.364
he'll have all small-town girls
wet for him.

18:51.433 --> 18:52.399
Ew, that is not what I meant.

18:52.468 --> 18:53.567
Brooke, you're a genius.

18:53.636 --> 18:55.102
Cary, you're a star.

18:55.170 --> 18:57.270
I love this family. Uh!

18:57.339 --> 19:00.040
Shuli, um, I did want to say

19:00.109 --> 19:03.477
that, um, I'm glad
you kept the video up.

19:03.545 --> 19:05.445
Um, it was weird at first,

19:05.514 --> 19:07.014
but it actually helped me

19:07.083 --> 19:08.791
realize some things
about myself that I...

19:08.859 --> 19:10.377
Okay.

19:13.643 --> 19:17.044
I am so glad you decided
to come here with me.

19:17.113 --> 19:18.946
I've been, like, 500 times.

19:19.014 --> 19:20.948
Everyone here loves me.

19:21.016 --> 19:23.684
Everyone here hates her.

19:23.753 --> 19:25.253
I'm gonna go get us more drinks.

19:25.321 --> 19:27.153
Whoo!

19:27.222 --> 19:29.155
It's you!

19:30.259 --> 19:32.525
Hey, Cary.

19:32.594 --> 19:36.396
- Oh, hey, good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

19:36.465 --> 19:38.900
- I loved you in the video.
- Oh, thanks.

19:38.986 --> 19:42.602
Um, it's been kind of a weird day.

19:42.671 --> 19:44.203
Uh, but good, you know. It's...

19:44.273 --> 19:45.938
I bet, I bet.

19:46.007 --> 19:47.206
Yeah.

19:47.276 --> 19:49.409
Um, would you maybe want

19:49.478 --> 19:51.911
to, uh, get food with me sometime?

19:51.980 --> 19:54.381
Oh, y...

19:54.449 --> 19:55.948
Yeah, yeah, no, I'd love that.

19:56.017 --> 19:57.317
- Cool.
- Yeah.

19:57.386 --> 19:59.486
Wait, why didn't you ask me out

19:59.554 --> 20:01.920
the whole time we were
doing that play together?

20:01.989 --> 20:04.356
Yeah, I didn't know you were gay.

20:04.425 --> 20:07.366
Oh, oh, thanks. Um.

20:07.436 --> 20:11.263
- Oh, uh, thanks?
- No, no, no, no. Not...

20:11.332 --> 20:16.535
Oh, I'm sorry. I just, uh... never mind.

20:16.604 --> 20:17.903
But it's really good to see you.

20:17.971 --> 20:19.738
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:22.576 --> 20:24.142
<i>♪ My brother's brave ♪</i>

20:24.211 --> 20:25.778
- <i>♪ My brother's wise ♪</i>

20:25.846 --> 20:28.046
<i>♪ My brother doesn't like... ♪</i>

20:28.115 --> 20:29.548
It's under Billy Eichner.

20:29.617 --> 20:31.550
Cary! Cary, get out here!

20:31.619 --> 20:34.319
They're playing your song!

20:34.387 --> 20:37.888
<i>- ♪ My brother's gay and here to stay ♪</i>
- Wow.

20:37.957 --> 20:39.190

20:39.258 --> 20:40.758

20:40.827 --> 20:42.794

20:42.862 --> 20:44.662

20:44.731 --> 20:47.832

20:47.900 --> 20:50.301
I'm his assistant!

21:10.179 --> 21:11.554
Oh, my God.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.578
I really needed this.

21:14.683 --> 21:18.816
Honestly, if your name is Shyamalay,
Chalamet, that's too much.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.824
I changed my last name,
he should consider it.

21:20.870 --> 21:23.005
He'd have a much bigger,
like the size of mine,

21:23.037 --> 21:25.305
you know what I mean?

21:25.907 --> 21:27.774
Everybody, welcome to The Other Show.

21:27.799 --> 21:29.390
- I'm Sarah.
- And I'm Chris.

21:29.415 --> 21:31.280
And we are here talking
about episode four

21:31.305 --> 21:33.873
with Hélene, Drew, and Case Walker.

21:33.898 --> 21:35.008
There's Chase.

21:35.033 --> 21:36.148
He's here.

21:36.187 --> 21:37.430
- He's here!
- Thanks for being here.

21:37.455 --> 21:39.140
- This was your first audition.
- Yes, ma'am.

21:39.203 --> 21:40.125
- Ever?
- Yes.

21:40.172 --> 21:42.136
Wow, thank you, Ma'am.

21:42.137 --> 21:43.267
I have to leave, ma'am.

21:43.292 --> 21:44.415
We'll cut out the ma'am.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.370
- So this is your first audition for...
- Yes.

21:46.425 --> 21:48.135
That is cool and sucks to hear.

21:49.056 --> 21:51.136
I feel like this was my last audition,

21:51.137 --> 21:53.001
and I was like "Woo! Thank, God."

21:53.026 --> 21:54.767
- That was the final one.
- That was it!

21:54.792 --> 21:56.923
I have a school dance next week.

21:56.985 --> 21:59.262
Maybe Chase could be my date?

21:59.989 --> 22:02.978
I was doing musical. lys
on a broken iPod,

22:03.018 --> 22:05.468
in my lip sync videos on a
broken iPod in my room,

22:05.493 --> 22:08.179
and I just kind of started
going up, and my mom's like...

22:08.204 --> 22:09.912
We went to the mall one
day and someone was like,

22:09.937 --> 22:11.353
"Hey, can I get a
picture with your son?"

22:11.354 --> 22:13.312
And my mom's like,
"What's going on here?"

22:13.313 --> 22:15.078
'Cause she has no clue
what's going on either.

22:15.103 --> 22:17.617
So, then she got into it,
and that's kind of,

22:17.642 --> 22:20.228
how it started, just in my
room, just doing what I like

22:20.229 --> 22:21.965
and having fun with it, yeah.

22:21.990 --> 22:23.393
The gays are turning on the vid.

22:23.394 --> 22:27.561
They're saying it's, quote,
"so five years ago".

22:28.605 --> 22:30.228
That's the worst thing you can be.

22:30.229 --> 22:33.145
There is an entire world
of people that you know

22:33.146 --> 22:35.250
- that I don't know are alive.
- Yep, yep.

22:35.275 --> 22:37.979
And people that we all know
and think are incredibly famous...

22:37.980 --> 22:39.281
- Then I'm just like, what?
- ...that you've never heard of.

22:39.306 --> 22:40.670
- Yes.
- So I was like,

22:40.695 --> 22:42.353
I want to throw out some names

22:42.354 --> 22:44.414
and see if you know if they're a person.

22:44.439 --> 22:46.915
- Have you ever heard of Helen Mirren?
- No.

22:46.940 --> 22:48.769
You've never heard
the name Helen Mirren?

22:48.770 --> 22:49.932
I've never heard the name Helen Mirren.

22:49.957 --> 22:51.288
It's like, usually, I'll tell you

22:51.313 --> 22:52.895
if I've actually heard them
or if I know who they are.

22:52.896 --> 22:54.103
- No, this is great.
- That's great.

22:54.104 --> 22:55.175
Okay, okay, okay.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.895
What do you think Helen Mirren does?

22:56.896 --> 22:58.312
She sounds like an actor.

22:58.313 --> 22:59.477
- Okay.
- Someone who does...

22:59.478 --> 23:01.068
- ...like skits or comedy.
- Why do you want to say that?

23:01.093 --> 23:02.622
- Skits or comedy?
- Comedy.

23:02.647 --> 23:04.358
- Jennifer Lawrence.
- Oh, yes, of course.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.561
Okay, I was like, that
could maybe even... okay.

23:06.586 --> 23:07.854
Wait, I have another one.

23:07.855 --> 23:09.528
Do you know who Steve Carell is?

23:09.553 --> 23:10.549
Yes, I've heard his name.

23:10.574 --> 23:11.604
I don't know who he is. I...

23:11.605 --> 23:13.927
If you showed me his face,
I wouldn't know, but I know his name.

23:13.952 --> 23:14.979
- Wow.
- That's cool.

23:14.980 --> 23:16.556
Do you know who Timothée Chamalet is?

23:16.581 --> 23:17.915
- No.
- Chamalet?

23:17.940 --> 23:19.811
- Is that not how you say it?
- Chalamet.

23:19.812 --> 23:20.687
Take a lap, take a lap.

23:20.688 --> 23:22.201
- Take a lap.
- Do you know what is it?

23:22.226 --> 23:24.393
Do you know who Timothée Chalamet is?

23:24.394 --> 23:25.479
Yeah, I do.

23:25.504 --> 23:26.586
But who's the other one?

23:26.611 --> 23:28.455
Now, give us people,
see if we know of anybody.

23:28.480 --> 23:29.955
Oh, see, okay...

23:29.980 --> 23:31.026
- KSI.
- Never heard.

23:31.051 --> 23:32.971
- Never heard of KSI.
- What's that?

23:32.996 --> 23:35.290
- A radio station.
- David Dobrik.

23:35.315 --> 23:36.829
- No.
- No?

23:36.854 --> 23:38.823
- It's not as fun this way.
- This is cute.

23:38.848 --> 23:40.146
Okay, wait. One more time.

23:40.147 --> 23:41.346
- One more time.
- Yeah, we see what we did to you...

23:41.371 --> 23:42.987
- ...and we're sorry.
- Liza Koshy.

23:43.012 --> 23:44.974
- No.
- You've never heard of Liza Koshy?

23:44.999 --> 23:46.638
She's getting really into more
like mainstream right now.

23:46.663 --> 23:47.974
Liza Koshy is your Helen Mirren.

23:47.999 --> 23:49.853
What does a YouTuber do?

23:49.854 --> 23:52.020
Hélene, we can't...

23:52.021 --> 23:53.021
We're not, we're not...

23:53.022 --> 23:54.393
Will they make scripted
stuff, or do they...

23:54.394 --> 23:56.686
Just for the record, we're not that bad.

23:56.687 --> 24:00.394
♪ 'Cause I think it's cool ♪

24:00.395 --> 24:03.955
♪ My brother's gay and that's okay ♪

24:03.980 --> 24:05.877
So I remember like right when
we were starting the shooting,

24:05.902 --> 24:07.838
they were like, "Yeah, so
we just need like 200 photos

24:07.863 --> 24:10.061
of you in your childhood,"
and I was like, "Oh, God."

24:10.062 --> 24:12.777
And like, videos too,
and I was like, "Oh, no,

24:12.802 --> 24:14.310
"I'm gonna have to like
watch a bunch of videos

24:14.335 --> 24:15.687
"that make me sad."

24:15.688 --> 24:17.686
So I got a bunch of
them, and they were like,

24:17.687 --> 24:18.936
"Hey, do you mind if we reach out

24:18.937 --> 24:21.417
"to some of your Facebook
friends from high school?"

24:21.442 --> 24:22.517
Yeah, sorry.

24:22.542 --> 24:24.751
And I was just kind of like
"Oh, yeah, those people

24:24.776 --> 24:26.436
"I haven't talked to in like ten years."

24:26.461 --> 24:27.796
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's...

24:27.820 --> 24:29.568
Let's reach out to them,
but it was like...

24:29.593 --> 24:30.724
Yeah, we just sort of need photos

24:30.749 --> 24:32.477
from anyone you've ever met
at any point in your life.

24:32.478 --> 24:33.603
Ever, that's all.

24:33.604 --> 24:35.722
Yeah, I actually reconnected
with some people,

24:35.747 --> 24:38.597
and I was like, "Hey, I'm
on a show now, and I'm...

24:38.622 --> 24:41.066
"Do you have any photos of
me being weird at parties?"

24:41.091 --> 24:43.623
If this keeps happening,
why do you keep showing up?

24:43.624 --> 24:45.957
Because one time out of ten
it really is a dying girl,

24:45.982 --> 24:47.973
and if you don't show
up, it's bad optics.

24:47.998 --> 24:49.889
And P!nk doesn't do bad optics.

24:49.914 --> 24:53.528
She does near constant
aerial gymnastics.

24:53.553 --> 24:56.220
Yeah, I don't want to insult
any of my fans here, but...

24:56.268 --> 24:58.840
So I had a fan...
I don't know, it was this one girl,

24:58.865 --> 25:00.019
and she was being really extreme,

25:00.044 --> 25:04.001
and in the DMs, she was like,
"Case, I'm dying, you need to..."

25:04.035 --> 25:06.283
And she was saying all
this really serious stuff.

25:06.308 --> 25:08.306
And so then we went into it.

25:08.331 --> 25:09.635
Because she was doing it for months.

25:09.660 --> 25:11.197
She was like, saying she's gonna die

25:11.222 --> 25:13.889
and that if I didn't do
anything, she would die like...

25:13.914 --> 25:16.041
- Jeez, yeah.
- It was very serious and sad.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.377
And so I was concerned,
so eventually I was like,

25:18.402 --> 25:20.224
I'm not going to send
her flowers to, like,

25:20.249 --> 25:22.913
someone who I don't even know
is real or actually dying.

25:22.914 --> 25:24.968
So we ended up calling the hospital

25:24.993 --> 25:27.063
and seeing if the girl
was actually dying.

25:27.088 --> 25:29.525
Then, a couple weeks later,
we found the photo online

25:29.550 --> 25:30.675
that she had posted.

25:30.700 --> 25:31.853
- Oh.
- So it was actually...

25:31.877 --> 25:33.283
She searched up, like a disease,

25:33.308 --> 25:34.828
and then took a photo of a young girl

25:34.853 --> 25:36.968
- and put it on her page.
- That is so disgusting.

25:36.993 --> 25:38.273
- It's bad, yeah.
- That's crazy.

25:38.337 --> 25:39.380
Yeah, it was pretty...

25:39.405 --> 25:41.255
And that became Brooke's
storyline in this episode.

25:41.280 --> 25:44.075
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Thank you so much for a great storyline.

25:44.146 --> 25:46.221
<i>"Dear ChaseDreams,
I've been in the hospital</i>

25:46.277 --> 25:48.651
<i>for seven weeks and
it's not looking good.</i>

25:48.676 --> 25:50.193
<i>Could you send me a t-shirt?</i>

25:50.194 --> 25:52.109
<i>You're my favorite singer ever.</i>

25:52.110 --> 25:53.852
<i>Love, Rachel Klein."</i>

25:53.877 --> 25:54.985
Poor girl.

25:54.986 --> 25:57.134
Such terrible taste in music.

25:57.159 --> 25:58.952
I wrote to Nutella.

25:58.977 --> 26:00.632
Oh, boy.

26:00.657 --> 26:04.547
I wrote them, I was like,
"Hello, I love Nutella,

26:04.572 --> 26:07.618
this is the greatest product ever. Um...

26:07.643 --> 26:09.774
Thank you so much for all that you do."

26:09.799 --> 26:11.851
And they sent me coupons
for free Nutella.

26:11.876 --> 26:12.777
Whoa.

26:12.802 --> 26:14.523
Then when they sent me free
coupons, I was like...

26:14.547 --> 26:15.748
Hmm.

26:15.749 --> 26:17.115
So I wrote, like, Ben & Jerry's...

26:17.140 --> 26:18.318
Yeah, then I were like...

26:18.319 --> 26:20.008
- ...where are my coupons?
- For sure, for sure.

26:20.033 --> 26:22.947
I remember I waited in line
at the mall for four hours

26:22.972 --> 26:24.517
to meet Candace Cameron.

26:24.568 --> 26:26.345
