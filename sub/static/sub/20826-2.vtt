00:24.388 --> 00:26.432
There's a pervert outside
staring at the house.

00:26.515 --> 00:27.850
Another one?

00:27.933 --> 00:31.187
I am so sick and tired
of these peeping Toms

00:31.270 --> 00:34.982
coming by to bend me over the davenport
with their filthy eyes.

00:35.065 --> 00:36.775
Boil some water, Gert.

00:36.859 --> 00:39.945

00:43.574 --> 00:45.993
Oh, isn't he handsome?

00:46.076 --> 00:49.205
And he's so fun and charming.

00:49.288 --> 00:50.789
He's gonna be a pilot, you know.

00:50.873 --> 00:53.918
Oh, sounds like he's the one.

00:54.001 --> 00:56.629
I don't know. Could be.

00:56.712 --> 00:59.298
I just... have this feeling,

00:59.381 --> 01:03.677
like if I'm with him,
we could have everything.

01:06.055 --> 01:09.016

01:09.099 --> 01:11.227
- Did you ever doubt me?
- Not for a second.

01:17.525 --> 01:21.153
- Mm, your cologne smells sweet.
- It's vanilla extract.

01:21.237 --> 01:22.947
Bob Pogo likes the smell of cake.

01:23.030 --> 01:24.365
Mm, me too.

01:29.912 --> 01:31.705
Oh, shit. Major.

01:31.789 --> 01:33.123
It's okay. He missed the rug.

01:33.207 --> 01:36.210
Agh, that smell
of dog puke and vanilla. It's...

01:36.293 --> 01:38.003
Oh, it's not doing it for me.

01:38.087 --> 01:40.089
You go get your job back.

01:40.714 --> 01:42.758
And we will pick this up tonight.

01:43.592 --> 01:46.512
You're damn right.

02:40.608 --> 02:44.361
You never listen to it. And anyway,
you stole it from the record store.

02:44.445 --> 02:46.864
- Don't touch my shit!
- Mom!

02:46.947 --> 02:48.907

Maureen, honey, I have to do
some Plast-A-Ware runs today,

02:53.746 --> 02:56.457
but I'll be back in time
for our Honeybee Scouts meeting,

02:56.540 --> 02:58.208
so buzz right on home after school.

02:58.292 --> 03:01.962
I don't want to be a Honeybee!
I want to do this!

03:02.046 --> 03:04.423
Princess, you'll do
lots of coloring in Honeybees.

03:04.506 --> 03:06.091
That's all you'll do!

03:06.800 --> 03:08.552
Why does the meeting have to be here?

03:08.635 --> 03:11.805
If I'm the Queen Bee,
we save the $5 for dues.

03:11.889 --> 03:14.600
Five bucks? Ah, that's chump change.

03:14.683 --> 03:17.811
Sue, now that I'm getting my job back,
our money worries are over.

03:17.895 --> 03:21.023
- Hell, you could even quit Plast-A-Ware.
- I... What?

03:21.106 --> 03:23.776
Bill, what do you say we get you
some hockey stuff for tryouts?

03:23.859 --> 03:26.570
- Really? Thanks, Dad!
- Dad, can you buy me a new guitar?

03:26.653 --> 03:27.863

So anyway, the airline called,
they want me back.

04:18.454 --> 04:20.499
Left a message on the answering machine.

04:20.582 --> 04:23.544
Yeah, I got one of those.
I might even get a raise.

04:23.627 --> 04:26.588
I'm so happy for you, Frank.
You're rolling in it!

04:26.672 --> 04:29.341
You should get in touch
with my boat broker.

04:29.425 --> 04:31.301
You should get a tiger too.

04:31.385 --> 04:34.888
I know a guy who gets the best tigers
you've ever seen.

04:34.972 --> 04:37.224
He'll even file the teeth down for you.

04:37.307 --> 04:40.060
It's like getting bit by a 500-pound duck.

04:40.144 --> 04:41.937
I packed you a lunch, working man.

04:42.020 --> 04:43.063
Egg salad.

04:43.147 --> 04:46.984
- It's Frank's lucky sandwich spread.
- A lady bringing her man his daily bread.

04:47.067 --> 04:49.194
Now that's love, man.

04:49.278 --> 04:52.281
- Don't forget your Colombian Mind Freak!
- My leftovers!

04:52.364 --> 04:56.201
Aw, Cutie Pie, you always remember
what I forget.

04:56.285 --> 04:59.830
Today's our three-week anniversary, Frank.
We haven't spent a second apart

04:59.913 --> 05:02.583
since I met her down
at the reindeer rental return desk.

05:02.666 --> 05:04.543
That fucking reindeer put a dent
in my garage.

05:04.626 --> 05:05.919
Goodbye, my love.

05:06.295 --> 05:10.090
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
I just made that up!

05:15.220 --> 05:17.222
I can quit any time I want!

05:17.306 --> 05:21.935
- Aw, he's so in love.
- He's gonna kill someone, Sue.

05:23.353 --> 05:24.730
Wait, wait.

05:24.813 --> 05:27.441
Were you serious about me
quitting my Plast-A-Ware job?

05:27.524 --> 05:30.693
Oh, now, don't get upset.
I know how much working

05:30.728 --> 05:32.738
means to you
and I was wrong to fight you on it.

05:32.821 --> 05:34.743
- But...
- No. No, no.

05:34.782 --> 05:38.327
- You really think I could quit it?
- Wait, you want to quit?

05:38.410 --> 05:41.955
I know I wanted a job,
but, Frank, it's horrible.

05:42.039 --> 05:44.041
I don't feel valued or respected.

05:44.124 --> 05:47.669
Vivian has me on-call around the clock,
running me all over the county

05:47.753 --> 05:50.797
to get chewed out by awful people
with hammertoes.

05:50.881 --> 05:53.300
Then quit!
I'll be working full-time.

05:53.383 --> 05:54.927
You can do whatever you want.

05:55.010 --> 05:58.430
Oh, like take care of me
and the kids again. That'll be fun.

05:58.514 --> 06:00.098
Be vice president of the house!

06:00.182 --> 06:02.768
Maybe I could go back to college
and finish my degree.

06:02.851 --> 06:04.770
You could do whatever your heart desires,

06:04.853 --> 06:07.689
as long as you're home by three.
I'll see you tonight.

06:16.490 --> 06:17.866
I'm gonna go back inside now.

06:17.950 --> 06:19.284
Okay.

06:19.368 --> 06:21.787
I'm locked out of the house.

06:21.870 --> 06:23.956
He forgot to leave me the key again.

06:24.748 --> 06:27.334
Hey, that back bedroom window
is always open.

06:27.417 --> 06:29.294
Just got to stand on a bucket to reach it.

06:34.841 --> 06:39.221
<i>Sue, it's Vivian.
Pick up, superstar.</i>

06:39.304 --> 06:42.349
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

06:42.432 --> 06:43.517
Hi, Vivian.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.936
Oh, thank God.
I'm having a Code Red here.

06:46.019 --> 06:48.939
Tracy's secretary quit,
and I have to cover for her,

06:49.022 --> 06:52.150
so I'm stuck in the bullpen
with the rest of the cattle.

06:52.234 --> 06:55.112
Things are a little crazy here, too.
It looks like Frank got his...

06:55.195 --> 06:58.352
This isn't about you!
So listen, your biggest customer,

06:58.387 --> 07:01.159
Julie, just called screaming
about her latest order.

07:01.243 --> 07:04.580
So drop everything,
and get to Ryetown, PDQ.

07:04.663 --> 07:10.563
Oh, and tie your hair back.
Chances are good you'll be eating shit.

07:11.753 --> 07:14.339
I love the part
in the Bong Water and Spliff record

07:14.423 --> 07:16.425
where they get arrested by Officer Doobie.

07:17.759 --> 07:20.345
I think "doobie" means sex.

07:22.848 --> 07:24.308
Step aside, little dicks!

07:25.267 --> 07:27.477
Greetings, denizens of Rivendell.

07:27.561 --> 07:28.437
- Hey, Murph.
- Man.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.188
Oh, hey, Claire.

07:30.272 --> 07:33.358
If your mom's still in jail,
maybe we can go back to your house and...

07:33.442 --> 07:35.569
I don't know,
have a crotch fight or something.

07:35.652 --> 07:39.740
I don't think you'd like it at my house.
There's water in the sink.

07:39.823 --> 07:42.701
You might drown in it.

07:42.784 --> 07:45.329
- Napalmed!
- Daddy wa-wa! Daddy wa-wa!

07:46.538 --> 07:48.165
Hey, I don't like water, so what?

07:48.248 --> 07:50.626
Water's stupid.
You can't even breathe in it.

07:50.709 --> 07:53.921
Smart one, Kevin.
Did you learn that in fuckhead class?

07:54.504 --> 07:57.090
Oh, man! Billy just torched you!

07:57.174 --> 07:59.968
Your brother is funny!

08:03.680 --> 08:05.807
Protect the vitals!

08:06.808 --> 08:09.519
I'll teach you about fuckhead class!

08:13.357 --> 08:14.316
My stick!

08:15.317 --> 08:17.277
Whoa! Mellow out, Murph.

08:17.361 --> 08:20.072
Yeah, man. You need to toke a doobie.

08:20.155 --> 08:23.033
- "Doobie."
- Blow my dick!

08:23.116 --> 08:24.451
I'm out of here!

08:27.663 --> 08:31.124
He shouldn't have done that to you.
Are you okay?

08:32.125 --> 08:34.962
Leave me alone!

08:35.044 --> 08:38.966
God, is every Murphy boy a pussy?

08:39.049 --> 08:42.186
Good one, Claire!

08:44.054 --> 08:47.808
Aw, these butter tubs
are all substandard!

08:47.891 --> 08:50.811
This doesn't burp. This is warped.

08:50.894 --> 08:53.480
And I don't like the way
this one's looking at me.

08:54.356 --> 08:56.233
I'm terribly sorry, Julie.

08:56.316 --> 08:59.403
I promise I will strive
to do better in the future.

08:59.486 --> 09:01.488
Well, that doesn't help me today.

09:01.571 --> 09:07.285
Sue, we have standards here in Ryetown.
And a shit load of Arabs.

09:07.369 --> 09:10.956
Julie, I certainly don't mean to rush you,
but I have to get home to my daughter.

09:11.039 --> 09:13.375
Oh, look who's not barren.

09:13.458 --> 09:17.206
- Can we please pick this up tomorrow?
- That's a hell of a way

09:17.241 --> 09:21.591

of the Platinum Lid Club!

09:21.675 --> 09:26.847

a couple gin and tonics for breakfast?

10:11.641 --> 10:13.185
Sorry, I was just...

10:13.852 --> 10:15.937
No. You know what, Julie?

10:16.021 --> 10:18.857
I already have three kids,
I don't need a fourth.

10:18.940 --> 10:22.778
And I certainly don't need to be talked to
like this by someone like you.

10:22.861 --> 10:24.946
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my daughter needs me.

10:25.030 --> 10:27.365
You will never get another bowl from me!

10:30.368 --> 10:34.956
- But what will I save my cat shit in?
- How about your fat ass?

10:35.040 --> 10:36.500
Shoo! Shoo!
Get out of here!

10:36.583 --> 10:40.670
- I will have you fired!
- Please do!

- Frank Murphy!

11:32.961 --> 11:35.642
If you're here to shoot up
the place, let me go on break first.

11:35.725 --> 11:38.019
I'm not killing anybody today.

11:38.103 --> 11:42.065
- Look out, old Frankie is back! Pow!
- Ah!

11:42.774 --> 11:45.026
Fucking Frank Murphy.

11:45.652 --> 11:46.528
Hey, Bob!

11:52.617 --> 11:54.369
I'll just sit right here.

12:00.792 --> 12:06.840
Frank, have you ever been stuck
in a freezing Cadillac for 17 hours?

12:08.216 --> 12:12.679
Ever shit yourself on Christmas Day
just to stay warm?

12:12.762 --> 12:17.767
Ever had the fire department cut you out
of a car that wasn't in an accident?

12:17.851 --> 12:19.644
No, can't say I have.

12:19.728 --> 12:21.688
It was humiliating, Frank.

12:21.771 --> 12:24.774
When they found me,
I was trying to lactate myself.

12:24.858 --> 12:27.194
Emotions were running high that night.

12:27.277 --> 12:31.608
But I want to thank you.
Being cooped up like veal

12:31.643 --> 12:35.744
made me realize
I bore some responsibility

12:35.827 --> 12:39.497
for being 300 pounds
above my fighting weight.

12:40.415 --> 12:44.836
So, in a way,
you saved my life that night.

12:44.920 --> 12:50.884
The jury's still out on my fingers.
Based on the smell, I'm not hopeful,

12:50.967 --> 12:56.890
but with the help of my wife,
I'm dieting, I'm exercising,

12:56.973 --> 13:00.977
and I am on my way to a healthier me.

13:07.901 --> 13:09.486
Oh, this is terrible.

13:10.278 --> 13:13.782
Anyway, I'm glad you came, Frank.

13:13.865 --> 13:19.287
To tell you the truth, this place is a
fucking nightmare since you've been gone.

13:19.371 --> 13:23.667
Dunbarton gave your job
to his shit-for-brains nephew, Scoop.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.502
Scoop Dunbarton?

13:25.585 --> 13:27.796
I remember him.
Wasn't he in the minor leagues?

13:27.879 --> 13:30.715
Yeah, and a major league prick.

13:30.799 --> 13:33.635
Just a miserable human being.

13:34.594 --> 13:39.224
He launched a one-man crusade
to re-segregate baseball.

13:39.307 --> 13:44.604
An injury ends his career,
so Dunbarton sticks me with him.

13:46.940 --> 13:48.733
God, this tastes like shit.

13:48.817 --> 13:51.236
If I could pull a trigger,
I'd kill myself.

13:51.319 --> 13:53.947
Well, Bob, I know it wasn't easy
for you to bring me back,

13:54.030 --> 13:56.992
but it would be my honor
to help make Mohican great again.

13:57.075 --> 13:58.702
Very good.

13:58.785 --> 14:02.956
About that, here's the job
I had in mind for you.

14:03.039 --> 14:04.833
Three days.

14:07.043 --> 14:09.713
- Excuse me?
- I'm stuck with Scoop,

14:09.796 --> 14:12.424
so I need you to come back
for three days and train him.

14:12.507 --> 14:15.010
Train him? I thought you were
giving me my old job back.

14:15.093 --> 14:20.140
Oh, no! Dunbarton wouldn't hire you
back in 100 years.

14:20.223 --> 14:22.350
You're toast around here.

14:23.518 --> 14:25.562
God, I miss toast.

14:25.645 --> 14:26.896
Are you out of your mind?

14:26.980 --> 14:29.065
You called me here
to train my replacement?

14:29.149 --> 14:31.651
- Yes, but...
- How could you be so heartless?

14:31.735 --> 14:33.653
It's not enough you screwed me over once?

14:33.737 --> 14:35.822
Now you want to put
my family through it again?

14:35.905 --> 14:38.825
What about what you put
my family through?!

14:38.908 --> 14:41.119
My boys spent Christmas Day

14:41.202 --> 14:45.749
watching Daddy get cut out
of a shit-crusted Cadillac!

14:45.832 --> 14:49.252
I still have to drive
with the windows down!

14:49.336 --> 14:52.672
You got what you deserved!
I saved this airline!

14:52.756 --> 14:55.967
- You owe me, you pig-faced fuck!
- I know that!

14:56.051 --> 14:58.136
And if you had helped me with this,

14:58.219 --> 15:02.182
I would've helped you
land a job at another airline!

15:02.265 --> 15:05.852
One of the big ones,
like Missitucky Central!

15:05.935 --> 15:08.980
Well, why wouldn't you tell me that
when I first came in here?

15:09.064 --> 15:13.693
It's called storytelling!
I was building to it!

15:13.777 --> 15:15.779
But no!

15:15.862 --> 15:18.573
You waltzed in here with your ego,

15:18.656 --> 15:23.328
expecting a red carpet
from the man you left for dead!

15:23.411 --> 15:25.538
You're done, Frank!

15:25.622 --> 15:29.417
I'll make sure you never work
in air travel again!

15:29.501 --> 15:35.173
You won't be able to get a job
as an engine de-gooser!

15:35.256 --> 15:38.385
Now get the fuck out of here!

15:40.303 --> 15:43.056
Look at me, I'm standing!

15:49.062 --> 15:50.480
I can't reach it!

15:50.563 --> 15:53.566
Hey, Ben, try this here electric lasso.

15:56.945 --> 15:58.780
- Oh, shit!
- I got it!

16:02.575 --> 16:03.451
Here he comes.

16:08.957 --> 16:12.168
If you die, can we eat you?

16:16.339 --> 16:18.675
"Cut to a close-up of Professor Bonewell.

16:18.758 --> 16:22.846
He says to the chick, 'Guess what?
Blowing all of us just now?

16:22.929 --> 16:25.723
That was your final exam.'"

16:25.807 --> 16:28.476
"You just graduated Fuck School."

16:28.560 --> 16:30.812
Fade out.
What do you think, Frank?

16:30.895 --> 16:33.189
Would you whack-off to that?
Be honest.

16:33.273 --> 16:35.817
Oh, don't bother Frank
with your dumb-ass porno.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.652
He's been fucked enough for one day.

16:39.362 --> 16:41.990
- Thanks.
- Frank, it sucks what they did to you,

16:42.073 --> 16:43.616
but you're lucky you're out of here.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.744
This new boss Scoop
is a walking clusterfuck!

16:46.828 --> 16:50.206
Yeah, dude just ain't
a half-brained asshole, he's dangerous.

16:50.290 --> 16:54.294
Guys, you don't have to badmouth
the new boss just to make me feel better.

16:54.377 --> 16:55.670
- I'm sure he's...
- Hey!

16:56.212 --> 17:00.967
What are you fuckers doing sitting around?
Get back to work!

17:01.050 --> 17:03.595
Ah! Oh, God!

17:06.763 --> 17:08.724
One of you frog parties fix this!

17:09.434 --> 17:11.102
Take some fucking initiative!

17:13.229 --> 17:15.482
That was Scoop? He...

17:16.316 --> 17:17.650
His... dent.

17:17.733 --> 17:21.404
One night in St. Louis,
he got drunk after throwing a no-hitter

17:21.488 --> 17:25.657
and got kicked in the head trying to carve
his name into the back of a Clydesdale.

17:25.742 --> 17:28.786
- You keep a clipping of it?
- We don't.

17:28.870 --> 17:31.956
Get your mitts off my me-paper!
Frog fucker!

17:33.333 --> 17:37.670
- Oh, for the love of Christ.
- I'm gonna go help Frank drown his sorrows.

17:37.754 --> 17:39.714
- You cover for me.
- What do I do?

17:39.797 --> 17:42.467
Just smile and act like Syracuse
ain't a fucking shithole.

17:46.846 --> 17:52.644
And that, girls, is how a Honeybee fixes
finger sandwiches for a Sweet 16 Party.

17:52.727 --> 17:54.521
Who'd want a finger sandwich?

17:54.604 --> 17:56.439
I've got one for you.

17:56.523 --> 17:58.733
You're ugly and nobody likes you.

18:01.277 --> 18:04.322
Now, girls, that's not
the Honeybee way. Let's move on.

18:05.615 --> 18:07.200
Hi, Bill. Don't mind us.

18:07.283 --> 18:08.701
Impossible.

18:10.036 --> 18:12.455
Okay, fun with plaster!

18:12.539 --> 18:15.458
<i>And now, the University of Miami...</i>

18:17.502 --> 18:20.171
<i>- ...of Ohio...
- Aww...</i>

18:20.255 --> 18:25.046
<i>...presents Bong Water & Spliff!</i>

18:26.719 --> 18:28.972
<i>Hey, Spliff.
The more I smoke,</i>

18:29.055 --> 18:30.932
<i>the more you look like a hot dog.</i>

18:31.015 --> 18:34.607
<i>Well, that's a fucked up thing
for a hamburger to say.</i>

18:39.524 --> 18:40.984
Genius. Ow!

18:41.067 --> 18:45.655
- Mom!
- Stay away from my records!

18:46.739 --> 18:50.535
- ...of Ohio, of Ohio, of Ohio...
- Kevin! Leave your brother alone!

18:50.618 --> 18:54.497
Mom, that doesn't do anything!
Ow!

18:54.581 --> 18:57.959
Okay. Sorry about that.
Let's mix it up.

18:58.042 --> 19:00.044
Squirt your dye.

19:00.128 --> 19:01.879
We'll make it a... beautiful blue.

19:04.090 --> 19:06.655
- Mom, the phone.
- I can't get it right now, honey.

19:06.656 --> 19:08.136
That's what the machine's for.

19:09.554 --> 19:12.932
<i>Leave a message at the tone.</i>

19:14.100 --> 19:18.826
<i>Hi, Sue, it's me.
I'm at this bar with Rosie because...</i>

19:19.480 --> 19:21.733
<i>- Oh, shit, I got bad news.
- Oh, no.</i>

19:21.816 --> 19:23.234
He sounds sleepy.

19:23.318 --> 19:27.172
<i>Things kind of went south
at the airport, and...</i>

19:27.207 --> 19:30.309
<i>- I kind of shot my mouth off.
- Get off the phone, white boy!</i>

19:30.344 --> 19:31.826
<i>Cut it out, you dick!</i>

19:31.909 --> 19:32.994
<i>- You're dead!
- Pogo got mad.</i>

19:33.077 --> 19:36.456
<i>He had to take a survival shit.
A guy got kicked by a horse.</i>

19:36.539 --> 19:39.542
<i>- Fuck School. Christ, I don't know!
- Stop touching my stuff!</i>

19:39.626 --> 19:42.378
- Stop touching yourself!
- Ow!

19:42.462 --> 19:44.505
What the hell is wrong with you animals?!

19:44.589 --> 19:46.632
I've got a house full
of little girls out there

19:46.633 --> 19:48.676
and your yelling is upsetting them!

19:48.760 --> 19:50.428
- He started it.
- He touched my records.

19:50.511 --> 19:53.348
I don't care!
I am done with you two!

19:53.431 --> 19:56.601
You're gonna keep your mouths shut
and stay in your beds until I say so!

19:56.684 --> 19:58.394
Do you understand?

19:59.354 --> 20:00.730
- Nice job.
- Eat me.

20:00.813 --> 20:02.940
Shut the fuck up!

20:06.152 --> 20:08.446
Okay, that's enough for today.

20:08.529 --> 20:10.323
We all had fun, right?

20:16.371 --> 20:17.872
I blew it, Rosie.

20:17.955 --> 20:20.958
I should've sat there
and kept my fucking mouth shut,

20:21.042 --> 20:22.960
I'd have a new job all lined up.

20:23.044 --> 20:25.546
But no. Not Frank Murphy.

20:25.630 --> 20:28.257
Had to call the old pig fucker
a pig fucker.

20:28.341 --> 20:29.842
Because that's what I do.

20:30.551 --> 20:31.886
I can't face Sue.

20:32.762 --> 20:33.763
This is gonna kill her.

20:33.846 --> 20:35.932
I bet she's worried about you.

20:36.015 --> 20:37.100
Go on home.

20:37.183 --> 20:38.559
You go home to your wife!

20:38.643 --> 20:41.187
Don't have to. She's right over there.

20:41.270 --> 20:42.814
Hey, Chauncey, baby.

20:42.897 --> 20:44.607
Your real name is Chauncey?

20:44.691 --> 20:46.651
You tell anybody that, I'll cut you deep.

20:47.402 --> 20:49.904
- Frank, you got to get past this.
- How?

20:49.987 --> 20:51.698
How am I supposed to get past this?

20:51.781 --> 20:55.410
What am I gonna do? I'm broke!
No savings, no credit.

20:55.493 --> 20:57.537
My family's got nothing now.

20:58.454 --> 21:00.623
Why did Sue buy that fucking TV?

21:00.707 --> 21:02.291
God will provide.

21:02.375 --> 21:04.669
No, I'm supposed to provide. I'm a man.

21:05.336 --> 21:08.005
The only thing God's ever given me
is a foot up my ass.

21:08.089 --> 21:12.176
I'm trying to sympathize, Frank,
but you're in a black man's bar.

21:12.260 --> 21:14.929
Your bottom is six floors
above our ceiling.

21:15.012 --> 21:16.556
- Right on.
- Yeah, you tell him.

21:16.639 --> 21:18.182
Right on.

21:19.183 --> 21:20.852
These people really like to participate.

21:20.935 --> 21:24.480
Look, if you're hurting that bad,
call my man Smokey.

21:24.564 --> 21:28.025
- He can always use some help.
- Rosie, I'm not selling drugs.

21:28.109 --> 21:30.820
Man, what kind of drug dealer
has a business card?

21:30.903 --> 21:32.613
We don't all sell dope!

21:32.697 --> 21:35.241
Ah, you're right. You're right. I'm sorry.

21:35.324 --> 21:36.367
That's okay.

21:36.451 --> 21:39.912
Drinks for everybody!
This peckerwood's buying!

21:41.038 --> 21:44.650
- Just fucking with you.
- I know! I'm poor!
