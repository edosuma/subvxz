We really have a lot

- Your Majesty,
pink or purple?
- Love the purple.

01:16.170 --> 01:18.500
Is everyone ready for
the meeting, Armando?

01:20.040 --> 01:23.170
Both. The Grand Council
meeting we have every morning.

01:23.170 --> 01:26.330
- Starting today.

01:26.330 --> 01:29.080
I should probably
add that to my schedule.

01:29.080 --> 01:31.460
Where's my... Oh!
Thank you.

01:31.460 --> 01:32.880
That reminds me.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.330
I need you to sign
this very important proclamation

01:35.330 --> 01:36.830
for the royal visit
tomorrow.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.710
- Okay

01:38.710 --> 01:39.830
What's that racket?

01:39.830 --> 01:42.330
My little sister.

01:42.330 --> 01:45.880
How's it going, Isabel?

01:45.880 --> 01:46.880
I just finished.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.000
Finished what?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.790
My latest invention.

01:49.790 --> 01:51.210
The presto changer.

01:51.210 --> 01:53.080
It puts your clothes on
for you.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.620
Think of how much time
everyone would save.

01:55.620 --> 01:58.620
Oh, I'll never have
mismatched socks again.

01:58.620 --> 02:01.080
Isabel's entering it in
the Invention Fair today.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.460
Inventors from
all over the kingdom

02:03.460 --> 02:05.620
are presenting
their latest creations.

02:05.620 --> 02:07.420
And Elena's gonna
be my helper.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.420
Ooh, let's test it out.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.330
Get ready.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.750
No!

02:20.750 --> 02:22.920
The flower's supposed
to go in your hair.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.880
Well, the point of
a test run

02:24.880 --> 02:26.710
is to work out
the kinks.

02:26.710 --> 02:28.080
Now you know the kink.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.580
True.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.120
What if something else
goes wrong?

02:31.120 --> 02:33.790
I'll be right by
your side to help fix it.

02:33.790 --> 02:35.170
I promise.

02:35.170 --> 02:36.670
Thanks, Elena.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.540
Morning, everyone.
Sorry I'm a little late.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.880
I was with Isabel...

02:46.880 --> 02:49.210
The Grand Council meeting
is called to order.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.120
Esteban, the crown princess
is supposed to do that.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.040
Of course.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.710
What was
I thinking?

02:55.710 --> 02:58.830
The Grand Council
will now come to order.

03:00.540 --> 03:01.830
Thank you.

03:01.830 --> 03:04.540
So, big week.
As everyone knows,

03:04.540 --> 03:08.330
King Toshi is visiting us
from the kingdom of Satu.

03:08.330 --> 03:09.960
How are the preparations
coming?

03:09.960 --> 03:13.380
The royal chef will be
serving an Avaloran feast.

03:13.380 --> 03:15.710
But since this is
a special occasion,

03:15.710 --> 03:18.170
I am making
the tamales myself.

03:18.170 --> 03:20.750
And I have prepared
a special song.

03:20.750 --> 03:23.540
No, no, no, no.

03:23.540 --> 03:25.920
This is King Toshi's
first visit to Avalor,

03:25.920 --> 03:29.040
and we must show him
that we understand his ways.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.920
We must prepare Satu food.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.670
We must play
Satu music.

03:32.670 --> 03:35.540
But if this is
his first time in Avalor,

03:35.540 --> 03:37.960
wouldn't he be interested in
how we do things here?

03:37.960 --> 03:41.040
No. I have been to
the kingdom of Satu many times,

03:41.040 --> 03:43.040
and I know it
better than anyone.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.670
What will impress
King Toshi most

03:44.670 --> 03:46.580
is doing things
the Satu way.

03:46.580 --> 03:48.250
But what about my tamales?

03:48.250 --> 03:49.920
Oh, they won't
go to waste.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.620
If Esteban is right,

03:51.620 --> 03:53.830
we cannot afford to offend
King Toshi.

03:53.830 --> 03:56.880
And I am sure Elena
wants her first royal visit

03:56.880 --> 03:59.040
as crown princess
to go well.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.210
I do.

04:01.210 --> 04:02.880
All right,
let's put it to a vote.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.120
All in favor of doing
everything the Satu way,

04:05.120 --> 04:07.920
- raise your hand.
- Hmm!

04:07.920 --> 04:10.710
Great. Now since
you're the expert, Esteban,

04:10.710 --> 04:13.170
you can teach us
the Satu ways.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.170
Oh, you do not have
to worry about that.

04:15.170 --> 04:17.210
I will handle
everything.

04:17.210 --> 04:20.380
But if the point
is to do things their way,
we should all know them.

04:20.380 --> 04:22.080
Um, yes,

04:22.080 --> 04:24.290
but I am incredibly busy.

04:24.290 --> 04:26.960
Actually, you're free
all afternoon, chancellor

04:26.960 --> 04:29.580
Thank you, Higgins.

04:29.580 --> 04:30.830
Perfect.

04:32.580 --> 04:34.080
Oh, meeting adjourned.

04:36.170 --> 04:38.790
These are the gowns
worn in Satu.

04:38.790 --> 04:40.290
Ooh, pretty.
I'll take that one.

04:40.290 --> 04:42.750
Now we will learn to eat
using chopsticks,

04:42.750 --> 04:44.670
like they do in Satu.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.920
Do not worry

04:49.920 --> 04:51.460
if you cannot
do it right away.

04:51.460 --> 04:53.920
- It took me years to--
- NAOMI: Hey!

04:53.920 --> 04:55.750
I think I got it.

04:59.420 --> 05:00.620
Elena?

05:00.620 --> 05:02.120
Keep practicing.

05:02.120 --> 05:05.580
You still have a few hours
before King Toshi arrives.

05:05.580 --> 05:07.000
He's coming today?!

05:07.000 --> 05:09.120
Today? But what about
the Invention Fair?

05:09.120 --> 05:11.580
Oh, Isabel,
don't worry.

05:11.580 --> 05:13.580
I'm still going
with you.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.420
Elena, I know you
want to help your sister,

05:15.420 --> 05:18.620
but it is your royal duty
to host King Toshi.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.750
Wait. Isabel.

05:21.750 --> 05:24.000
I thought King Toshi
was coming tomorrow.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.920
Oh, he left a day early.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.920
I thought I told you.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.580
You did not tell
any of us.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.920
Well, he's not here yet.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.920
So I'll just go down to
the Invention Fair,

05:34.920 --> 05:37.080
help Isa set up,
and be back before he arrives.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.750
I don't know, Elena.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.330
Do you have
enough time?

05:40.330 --> 05:42.500
Oh, she has plenty of time.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.710
King Toshi's not expected
until this afternoon.

05:44.710 --> 05:47.460
Great. I'll be back
before you know it.

05:47.460 --> 05:50.750
I better run home and let
my father know I'm
meeting a king later.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.880
This is turning out
better than I'd hoped, Higgins.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.460
What is, chancellor?

05:58.460 --> 06:01.750
I wanted Elena to be unprepared
for King Toshi's visit,

06:01.750 --> 06:03.330
so I could show off
my expertise.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.790
But now, she might not
even be here at all.

06:05.790 --> 06:07.500
So that's why you
didn't tell them

06:07.500 --> 06:09.710
King Toshi
was coming today.

06:09.710 --> 06:11.880
- You catch on
quickly, Higgins.
- Thank you.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.830
Once King Toshi sees
how well I know his ways,

06:14.830 --> 06:17.330
he will entrust me
to make the trade agreement,

06:17.330 --> 06:19.250
and it will be clear
to everyone

06:19.250 --> 06:21.790
who is the real power
behind the throne.

06:21.790 --> 06:24.500
- Me!

06:24.500 --> 06:26.790
And I have a special
surprise for King Toshi

06:26.790 --> 06:28.330
that will close the deal.

06:28.330 --> 06:30.790
Ooh, what is it?
Tell me, tell me!

06:30.790 --> 06:32.960
You will see
soon enough, Higgins.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.330
All right, let's
pack up and get going.

06:39.330 --> 06:41.790
But I thought you didn't
have time to help me.

06:41.790 --> 06:44.790

08:32.750 --> 08:34.790
Elena, this is
for you.

08:34.790 --> 08:37.080
I made you a necklace
out of spare parts.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.620
Oh, I love it.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.080
Thanks for always
being here for me.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.120
King Toshi.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.500
He's here.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.960
- I found a cart.
- Cart. Great.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.580
Let's get this thing
inside and set up.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.710
There's no need to rush.
We have plenty of time.

08:59.710 --> 09:01.330
Not really.

09:01.330 --> 09:03.670
- This is her spot.
Oh.

09:07.790 --> 09:10.880
- My invention!
- I'm sorry, Isa.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.920
- Is it...
- It's okay.
I can fix it.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.000
I just need
my twist hook.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.960
I must've left it
back at the palace.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.170
The palace? No problem.
I'll get it.

09:19.170 --> 09:21.710
No need. I'll grab it
and be back before you know it.

09:21.710 --> 09:24.830
Oh, no, no, no.
It would be way easier
for me to find it.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.420
I know exactly
where it is.

09:26.420 --> 09:27.790
- Red.

09:27.790 --> 09:29.620
- With a flat handle.
- Round.

09:29.620 --> 09:30.920
On it!

09:37.620 --> 09:39.620
We're not gonna make it.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.080
Race you to the palace,
princesa.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.170
Skyler! Yes.

09:45.170 --> 09:46.920
I have a better idea.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.000
How about you give me
a lift,

09:48.000 --> 09:49.750
and we race that coach?

09:49.750 --> 09:51.500
You got it.
There's no time to stop.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.330
On the count
of three, jump.

09:53.330 --> 09:54.960
One...

09:54.960 --> 09:56.920
I said on three.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.670
I don't have time
for two or three. Let's go!

09:58.670 --> 10:00.040
Hold on!

10:08.790 --> 10:10.250
King Toshi.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.920
King Toshi is here!

10:13.920 --> 10:15.250
Not to worry.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.830
I will greet King Toshi
on her behalf.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.920
Uh, mallet, screwdriver,
no idea what this is.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.750
Twist hook!

10:30.670 --> 10:32.500
Ah, King--

10:32.500 --> 10:34.290
Toshi.

10:34.290 --> 10:37.920
On behalf of my kingdom,
welcome to Avalor.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.120
We are honored to
be here, Princess Elena.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.880
This is Soji,
my royal advisor.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.920
Please accept this gift
on behalf of my kingdom.

10:45.920 --> 10:49.120
A fan made from
the finest silk in Satu.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.620
It's beautiful.

10:51.620 --> 10:52.880
Thank you.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.540
This is
my grandmother Luisa,

10:54.540 --> 10:57.040
and my grandfather
Francisco.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.120
And you already know
my cousin Esteban.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.330
Chancellor Esteban.

11:01.330 --> 11:04.250
Oh, and is that something
for King Toshi in your hand?

11:04.250 --> 11:07.290
This? Yes.
It's a twist hook.

11:07.290 --> 11:10.580
Made from the finest
iron in Avalor.

11:10.580 --> 11:13.790
Ah. I have never seen
anything like it.

11:13.790 --> 11:16.710
Much like the architecture
of this palace.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.750
Oh, would you like
a tour?

11:18.750 --> 11:20.290
My grandparents can
lead you on one.

11:20.290 --> 11:22.500
They know all about
its history.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.920
Let me hang onto this
for you so you don't
have to carry it around.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.170
You are the crown
princess, Elena.

11:27.170 --> 11:29.170
You should lead
the tour.

11:29.170 --> 11:32.500
Oh, yes.
Of course.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.920
Right this way.

11:36.080 --> 11:39.040
If I move a bolt over here,
and another one over there,

11:39.040 --> 11:41.920
the piece should snap
back into place.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.500
No, it's stuck.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.250
I really need
that twist hook.

11:45.250 --> 11:46.830
You know, when
the drawbridge gets stuck,

11:46.830 --> 11:49.620
we have a trick
to get it moving again.

11:50.670 --> 11:52.250
- Hey!
- Ow!

11:52.250 --> 11:55.920
Wow. It actually
may have worked.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.540
Let's try
testing it out.

11:57.540 --> 11:59.460
- Not at all.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.710
Uh, was it supposed
to do that?

12:11.710 --> 12:14.080
There must be something else
that's still broken.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.880
What is taking
Elena so long?

12:15.880 --> 12:17.670
She should be back by now.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.880
And here's the parlor,
the music room,

12:19.880 --> 12:21.750
drawing room,
sitting room,

12:21.750 --> 12:25.460
which is the perfect place
to sit and take a nap.

12:25.460 --> 12:27.460
You must be exhausted
from your journey.

12:27.460 --> 12:29.830
Thank you, but I am not
tired at all.

12:29.830 --> 12:34.170
Now, Elena, there are
no siestas in Satu.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.290
I have planned a full
afternoon of festivities,

12:37.290 --> 12:39.250
a lovely Satu feast,

12:39.250 --> 12:41.880
followed by a concert
of Satu music.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.790
And last but not least,
a special surprise

12:43.790 --> 12:45.710
a special surprise
I know you will love.

12:45.710 --> 12:47.920
So let us begin,
shall we?

12:47.920 --> 12:50.420
Coming, Elena?

12:50.420 --> 12:52.670
Right behind you, cousin.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.790
Hey, Armando,
sorry I'm late.

12:58.790 --> 13:00.420
Oh, hi, Naom...

13:00.420 --> 13:02.000
Naomi?

13:04.420 --> 13:05.500
I need your help.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.750
There's no way
this is gonna work.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.830
Of course it will.

13:12.830 --> 13:15.170
All you have to do
is sit at the table
and pretend to be me.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.790
I'll give this twist hook
to Isabel and be right back.

13:17.790 --> 13:19.880
Are you sure no one
will recognize me?

13:19.880 --> 13:21.120
Not with the hood
over your hair,

13:21.120 --> 13:22.710
and this fan
covering your face.

13:22.710 --> 13:25.170
But I can't see anything.

13:25.170 --> 13:28.080
Perfect. That means they
won't be able to see you.
You better hurry.

13:33.330 --> 13:34.750
Is Elena coming?

13:34.750 --> 13:36.750
Whoa... oh!

13:36.750 --> 13:39.380
Oh, Elena.

13:39.380 --> 13:40.960
Oh, good.
You're here.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.790
- We can begin.

13:42.790 --> 13:44.920
We cannot wait
any longer.

13:46.120 --> 13:49.920
A Satu feast with
all your favorite dishes.

13:49.920 --> 13:53.620
Princess Elena, why don't
you show King Toshi
your chopsticks skills.

13:56.290 --> 13:57.920
Impressive.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.750
But this morning...

13:59.750 --> 14:02.000
My granddaughter
is a fast learner.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.790
Hmm.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.420
I'm here.

14:09.420 --> 14:10.920
What took you so long?

14:10.920 --> 14:12.920
And why did you change?

14:12.920 --> 14:15.920
Uh, wardrobe malfunction.
I got your twist hook.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.080
I already fixed that part,

14:17.080 --> 14:18.790
but the cogs are
out of alignment.

14:18.790 --> 14:21.500
I have to move
50 different bolts
to get them back.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.830
Make that 51.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.540
Is there anything
I can do to help?

14:25.540 --> 14:27.750
I wish there was,
but I have to do it myself.

14:27.750 --> 14:29.120
Great!

14:29.120 --> 14:30.920
I mean, okay.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.290
If that's what you want.

14:32.290 --> 14:33.670
I'll just be right back.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.250
Where are you
going now?

14:35.250 --> 14:37.580
Um, to get a drink.
Want one?

14:37.580 --> 14:39.170
- No.
- I'll take an horchata.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.330
One horchata,
coming up.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.460
Ow!

14:51.460 --> 14:53.460
Psst. Naomi.

14:54.750 --> 14:57.710
Excuse me.

14:58.830 --> 15:00.290
So what'd I miss?

15:00.290 --> 15:02.500
Me, almost getting caught.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.500
Do you know how hard it is
to use chopsticks

15:04.500 --> 15:06.330
with a fan
covering your face?

15:06.330 --> 15:09.830
- But you made it look
so easy, Naomi.
-  Abuela.

15:09.830 --> 15:13.000
You went back to
the Invention Fair,
didn't you?

15:13.000 --> 15:14.920
Yes. I'm sorry.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.790
Mija, this is
your first royal visit.

15:17.790 --> 15:19.120
I know, I know.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.330
But Isa's having trouble
with her invention.

15:21.330 --> 15:24.710
- I need to
be there for her.

15:24.710 --> 15:26.790
All right, go.

15:26.790 --> 15:28.420
I'll cover for you.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.170
But no more of
this silly swapping.

15:30.170 --> 15:33.330
Just hurry back before
your cousin's big surprise.

15:33.330 --> 15:35.790
I will.
Thank you.

15:42.830 --> 15:45.540
Elena will be
right back.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.880
But look who's here.
Naomi.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.120
Hey, Your Majesty.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.710
- Be right back.
- Take your time.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.170
No! It should
be working.

16:01.170 --> 16:03.670
It's okay. I'm sure
we can fix it.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.620
And where's my horchata?

16:09.080 --> 16:13.330
Hey, you weren't wearing
those slippers before.

16:13.330 --> 16:14.790
You went back to the palace.

16:14.790 --> 16:16.880
That's where you've
been going.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.830
Yes. A king is visiting, Isa.

16:19.830 --> 16:24.210
I want to be here with you,
but I have to be there
for King Toshi,

16:24.210 --> 16:26.420
and our kingdom.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.210
You said you would
always make time for me.

16:29.210 --> 16:30.790
I know, I know.
But today--

16:30.790 --> 16:32.710
You have more important
things to do.

16:32.710 --> 16:33.920
- No, I--
- It's okay.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.920
I can fix
the machine myself.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.580
Isabel.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.880
Just go, Elena.

16:39.880 --> 16:41.830
I'm sorry, Isa.

16:47.330 --> 16:50.710
Oh, hi. You're just
in time for Esteban's
big surprise.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.290
King Toshi, to show

16:53.290 --> 16:54.880
our honor and respect,

16:54.880 --> 16:57.580
I have learned to perform
the most cherished

16:57.580 --> 16:59.960
and difficult Satu dance.

16:59.960 --> 17:03.170
The Dance of
the Fluttering Fans.

17:10.380 --> 17:11.960
Esteban is dancing?

17:11.960 --> 17:14.710
Well, I definitely
didn't see that coming.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.710
Just tell me
when it's over.

17:41.710 --> 17:43.710
I can't.
I'm not looking either.

17:43.710 --> 17:46.920
We can make him stop.

17:46.920 --> 17:48.960
No, no. I promised
the chancellor

17:48.960 --> 17:51.380
he could show me
his surprise.

17:51.380 --> 17:54.880
And in Satu, it is
very important to
keep your promises.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.880
no matter how painful
they are to watch.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.750
You're right, King Toshi.

18:01.750 --> 18:03.960
Promises are important
in Avalor, too.

18:03.960 --> 18:07.420
I think we'd make
great trade allies,

18:07.420 --> 18:09.170
and I'm really sorry
to do this,

18:09.170 --> 18:11.580
but I made a promise
to help my sister

18:11.580 --> 18:14.460
at the Invention Fair,
and I must put my family first.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.670
I hope you understand.

18:21.710 --> 18:23.880
Thank you for hosting us,
but we must go.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.420
Ay, no. This is
a diplomatic catastrophe!

18:30.420 --> 18:32.620
Elena is clearly not ready
for the responsibility

18:32.620 --> 18:35.120
that comes with the crown.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.750
King Toshi, wait!

18:39.380 --> 18:41.750
All right, two more inventors,
and then you're up.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.290
- Packing up.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.500
- You can't quit.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.710
Keeping my promise.

18:49.710 --> 18:52.750
What about your big
royal visit?

18:52.750 --> 18:56.880
No royal duty will ever
be as important as you.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.500
Now let's get
this thing fixed.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.040
There's no way I can
fix the machine in time.

19:02.040 --> 19:06.040
Maybe you can't,
but I know we can.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.670
All we need is
a little sister time.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.750
So where do we start?

19:12.750 --> 19:14.330
Well, I need the pliers.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.170
The pincher thingy.

19:17.170 --> 19:19.790
- Got 'em.
- Squiggly bolt.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.830
Silver flat
doughnut thingy.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.790
Six-sided pinky ring.

19:27.210 --> 19:30.620
Oh! This is why the cogs
keep coming loose.

19:30.620 --> 19:32.000
The chain is broken,

19:32.000 --> 19:33.920
and I don't have
another one.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.620
Okay, don't panic.
We can figure this out.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.920
We just need
to get creative.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.880
Hey, what about my necklace?

19:40.880 --> 19:42.500
It kinda looks
like a chain.

19:42.500 --> 19:45.170
You're right!
It's the right length.

19:45.170 --> 19:46.750
But I don't know
if it's strong enough.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.790
There's only one way
to find out.

19:48.790 --> 19:49.710
Here comes the judge.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.420
Are you ready to present
your invention?

19:54.420 --> 19:56.960
She sure is.
Let's do this.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.330
Hmm.

20:05.330 --> 20:08.580
( machine whirring
and squeaking )

20:18.330 --> 20:20.750
- Princess Elena.
- King Toshi!

20:20.750 --> 20:24.880
Please allow me
to explain, Your Excellency.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.750
Family is first
in Satu as well,

20:27.750 --> 20:31.710
which is why I always
travel with my brother.

20:31.710 --> 20:34.790
So you're not upset
I left?

20:34.790 --> 20:36.670
Not at all.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.710
I already know
what Satu is like.

20:38.710 --> 20:41.290
The purpose of my trip
is to experience

20:41.290 --> 20:44.080
the sights and sounds
of Avalor.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.830
But what has really
impressed me

20:45.830 --> 20:48.540
is how you value
your family

20:48.540 --> 20:50.830
as much as your kingdom.

20:50.830 --> 20:54.580
This is exactly
what I look for
in an ally.

20:54.580 --> 20:56.080
Then you'll be
our new trade partner?

20:56.080 --> 20:58.830
I would be honored.

21:03.750 --> 21:06.330
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

21:06.330 --> 21:09.580
Oh, is that my twist hook?

21:16.040 --> 21:18.790
What a marvelous
invention.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.710
Please enjoy the tamales

21:24.710 --> 21:28.790
- my dear Luisa
has prepared for you.
- Thank you.

21:28.790 --> 21:31.750
You open it like a present,
and then, dig in.

21:35.170 --> 21:37.920
Oh, my.
This is delicious.

21:37.920 --> 21:42.420
And now I will play one of
my favorite Avaloran songs.

21:45.250 --> 21:48.080
Chancellor Esteban,
when in Avalor,

21:48.080 --> 21:51.330
perhaps you should do it
the Avaloran way.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.920
Thank you, Elena.
You were really
there for me today.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.420
That's what sisters do.
