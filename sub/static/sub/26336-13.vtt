Hey.
Where's my girl?

00:22.979 --> 00:24.981
Good morning
to you, too.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.156
Yo!

00:26.200 --> 00:27.505
Uncle Steve.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.942
Steve.What's up? What's up?

00:29.986 --> 00:31.248
Don't do that.
Don't get up.

00:31.292 --> 00:35.035
Don't get up. Stay right there.
Oh, hi, hi, hi.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.340
How you doing?Good.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.038
Good. You look good.
You look good.
Thank you.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.170
How's Pops doing? Is he looking
after you okay while Mom's away?

00:40.214 --> 00:43.086
That's a silly question.
Of course I am.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.957
Whoa, hey.
What?

00:45.001 --> 00:46.307
What's the matter with you?
What are you, an animal?

00:46.350 --> 00:48.135
Just want a little piece.She's, uh, recovering

00:48.178 --> 00:49.397
from a serious accident.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.876
You don't need pancakes.
She needs pancakes.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.008
Sit down and relax.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.662
Eat up, so you can
get back in bed.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.838
But I'm not at all tired
or hungry.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.492
Yay!DANNY: Oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:57.535 --> 01:00.060
Please put the, uh, plate back
in front of my daughter, please.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.627
Thank you. Okay,
here's the thing.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.803
Doctor said you got
to eat a lot of food,

01:04.847 --> 01:07.110
you got to get a lot of rest,
and you'll feel like

01:07.154 --> 01:09.025
a nice young lady again,
you'll feel normal,

01:09.069 --> 01:11.114
like a person,
so please eat your pancakes.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.029
Okay. But, Dad, I was actually
feeling a little cold.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.422
Could you get me my sweatshirt?

01:14.465 --> 01:16.032
Please?

01:16.076 --> 01:18.208
You're cold?

01:18.252 --> 01:20.080
You don't have
a fever or nothing.

01:20.123 --> 01:22.038
All right. Don't touch
her pancakes, you animal.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.521
Please. You got to do something.
He's driving me crazy.

01:26.564 --> 01:27.696
It's that bad?
Yeah.

01:27.739 --> 01:30.046
He's all up in my business
all day.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.569
Checking up on me,
bringing me food.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.049
So much soup.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.833
Soup? He's doing soup?
Soup.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.270
Matzo ball?

01:36.313 --> 01:38.663
Oy, he's like a Jewish
grandmother with that stuff.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.187
All right, look, Gracie,
here's the thing.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.318
When you were
in the hospital,

01:41.362 --> 01:43.668
Danno was really
upset, of course.

01:43.712 --> 01:45.496
He felt helpless, there
was nothing he could do.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.759
He just had to sit there
and wait for the news,

01:47.803 --> 01:49.196
but now that
he's got you

01:49.239 --> 01:51.154
back home, he wants to
take care of you, you know?

01:51.198 --> 01:53.200
And he's gonna do everything
he can to get you

01:53.243 --> 01:55.158
back on your feet.
He loves you, you know.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.681
And I love him for that.Hmm.

01:56.725 --> 01:58.205
But if you could just
get him out of here,

01:58.248 --> 01:59.684
even for a few hours.

01:59.728 --> 02:02.948
Give me one of those pancakes.
Hey.
DANNY: Hey.

02:02.992 --> 02:05.081
What's the matter with you?
Why aren't you eating? Huh?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.430
I was waiting for you.

02:06.474 --> 02:07.997
You were waiting for me
so you could start eating?

02:08.040 --> 02:09.607
Yeah. Yeah.
Eat. Come on.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.218
You want me to butter
your pancakes like you're six?Yeah.

02:13.655 --> 02:15.352
You never butter
my pancakes.

02:15.396 --> 02:17.311
Yeah. McGarrett.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.051
Yeah, I'm with him right now.
We'll be right there.

02:19.095 --> 02:20.488
"We"? What's "we"?

02:20.531 --> 02:22.707
I need you, buddy.
I just got a homicide.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.187
I'm gonna need you
on this one.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.885
I'm so sorry. Grace, are you
gonna be okay if I take him?

02:26.929 --> 02:28.191
Aw. You go.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.627
I'll be okay,
but I was really

02:29.671 --> 02:31.238
looking forward to spending
the day with you, Daddy.

02:31.281 --> 02:34.284
Me, too, Monkey.
Eat, please.

02:37.113 --> 02:38.593
: Thank you.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.601
STEVE:
So, uh...

02:46.644 --> 02:50.605
you've been spending a lot
of time with Rachel, huh?

02:50.648 --> 02:53.129
Yeah. We're taking care
of our daughter

02:53.173 --> 02:54.957
who was in a near-fatal
car accident.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.003
Uh-huh. I'm just saying,
this whole, uh,

02:58.047 --> 02:59.962
this whole
"playing house" thing,

03:00.005 --> 03:01.616
wondering how much
it's got to do with...

03:01.659 --> 03:04.227
Rachel as well as Grace.
What's going on there?

03:04.271 --> 03:06.098
I... Nothing's going on.
I mean, we don't want

03:06.142 --> 03:08.405
to kill each other for the
first time in a long time.

03:08.449 --> 03:10.233
Is that... is that
all right with you, or...?

03:10.277 --> 03:11.626
Yeah! Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.802
I-I'm just wondering if
you've thought about, maybe,

03:13.845 --> 03:15.673
what the plan is,
you know?

03:15.717 --> 03:18.110
No. No, no. No plan.
It's not, uh...

03:18.154 --> 03:20.200
it's not like a special op,
you know what I mean?

03:20.243 --> 03:22.114
There's no...
no specific plan.

03:22.158 --> 03:23.942
So it's just, it's,
uh, freestyling,

03:23.986 --> 03:26.162
you're freestyling, like,
relationship jazz?

03:26.206 --> 03:28.860
DANNY:
Yeah, I'm basically Miles Davis.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.079
Noelani, good morning.

03:30.122 --> 03:33.300
Commander McGarrett,
Detective Williams.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.258
DANNY: Glad I didn't let
you eat those pancakes.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.259
Why?

03:36.303 --> 03:37.521
'Cause of him?

03:37.565 --> 03:40.263
Oh, I don't have
a weak stomach like you.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.830
Uh, sorry.
What do we know so far?

03:41.873 --> 03:44.136
John Doe. Couple surfers
found him this morning.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.877
Throat was slashed.
My stethoscope camera

03:45.921 --> 03:47.270
indicated no water
in the lungs,

03:47.314 --> 03:49.664
which means he was dead
before he hit the water.

03:49.707 --> 03:51.883
No, I don't think this guy
was killed and thrown

03:51.927 --> 03:53.145
in the ocean; I think he was

03:53.189 --> 03:55.017
killed at the bottom
of the ocean.
Really?

03:55.060 --> 03:56.888
Commander McGarrett's right.
The internal bleeding

03:56.932 --> 03:58.716
and marbling of the skin
are signs of sudden

03:58.760 --> 04:00.196
and massive
decompression.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.024
DANNY: Decompression.
So, like, he came up too quick

04:02.067 --> 04:03.243
and got the bends?

04:03.286 --> 04:05.070
Exactly. The rapid
change of pressure

04:05.114 --> 04:06.985
causes the nitrogen
in the body to separate,

04:07.029 --> 04:08.291
forming bubbles in the blood,
wreaking havoc

04:08.335 --> 04:10.859
on the internal organs.
It's like when you

04:10.902 --> 04:14.123
shake up a bottle of soda
and then remove the cap.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.646
This guy literally exploded
from the inside.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.126
STEVE:
And decompression--
or rather

04:17.169 --> 04:19.302
a lack of decompression--
this severe means this guy

04:19.346 --> 04:20.999
had to have been deep.

04:21.043 --> 04:23.263
I mean, at least 150 feet plus,

04:23.306 --> 04:26.091
and he had to have stayed there
for a prolonged period of time.

04:26.135 --> 04:27.267
DANNY: All right,
so where's his dive gear?

04:27.310 --> 04:29.007
I mean, the guy
looks like he's ready

04:29.051 --> 04:30.313
for his shift at
Banana Republic.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.619
That's a really
good point.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.316
The guy's not wearing
any dive gear, so what

04:33.360 --> 04:35.318
was he doing on the bottom
of the ocean?

05:20.581 --> 05:22.017
Hey, what are
you doing?

05:24.193 --> 05:27.327
Hey!

05:28.937 --> 05:31.243
I guess Mom didn't tell you
I was coming over.

05:31.287 --> 05:33.333
She told me you might need
a hand with this deck.

05:33.376 --> 05:36.379
Wrong.Are you sure? 'Cause...

05:36.423 --> 05:37.989
it looks like nothing's changed

05:38.033 --> 05:40.252
since the last time I was here
at Thanksgiving.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.167
You brought the wrong wood.

05:42.211 --> 05:44.300
It's red cedar.
It'll last longer.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.128
Sure. It'll take me days

05:46.171 --> 05:48.260
to power-wash
and re-coat every year,

05:48.304 --> 05:50.393
but that's not
your problem, is it?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.264
You're never here, anyway.

05:52.308 --> 05:55.050
I'm here now.Hm. Yeah,

05:55.093 --> 05:56.747
until you make up some excuse
to go run off.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.053
You and your, uh, busy schedule.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.404
All right.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.493
You know what, Dad?

06:05.060 --> 06:07.932
This time, I don't need
an excuse to leave.

06:07.976 --> 06:09.412
You're enough.

06:18.508 --> 06:19.901
Victim's name is Jason Kamaka.

06:19.944 --> 06:22.294
He was a professor of
oceanography at Oahu State.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.862
That is until three months ago,
when he took a leave of absence

06:24.906 --> 06:26.560
to work on this project.

06:26.603 --> 06:30.172
The Neptune One.
It's a deep-sea research lab.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.695
Okay, well, now we know
what our victim

06:31.739 --> 06:33.393
was doing on the bottom
of the ocean.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.482
Oof. I thought
my commute was bad.

06:35.525 --> 06:39.050
The Neptune's crew is six weeks
into a two-month mission,

06:39.094 --> 06:41.618
and they are studying the
effects the Kilauea's lava flow

06:41.662 --> 06:43.620
has on marine ecosystems.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.579
Everything was put together
by this guy.

06:45.622 --> 06:46.971
DANNY:
Who's he?

06:47.015 --> 06:48.712
ADAM: Claude Nostromo.
Guy made his fortune

06:48.756 --> 06:50.366
in database software

06:50.410 --> 06:53.064
and cloud engineering systems.
Now his company has interests

06:53.108 --> 06:55.415
in everything from rockets
to hydrogen fuel

06:55.458 --> 06:57.199
to the Neptune One.

06:57.242 --> 06:58.722
This thing's on the bottom
of the ocean,

06:58.766 --> 07:00.376
completely cut off
from the outside world,

07:00.420 --> 07:02.683
which means our victim
had to have been killed

07:02.726 --> 07:04.206
by one of four people, no?

07:04.249 --> 07:06.164
TANI: So you're saying that
this murder could've been

07:06.208 --> 07:07.514
over lava research?

07:07.557 --> 07:09.341
I don't know. Maybe.
I don't know what it was over.

07:09.385 --> 07:10.865
But here's the thing.

07:10.908 --> 07:12.519
There are some other factors
to take into consideration.

07:12.562 --> 07:13.911
I mean, these guys are in

07:13.955 --> 07:15.478
serious close quarters
for long periods of time.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.175
That can make anybody crazy.

07:17.219 --> 07:20.396
Plus, you got the depth factor
and what that does to the brain.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.529
Something called
high-pressure nervous syndrome.

07:22.572 --> 07:23.747
I'm talking about paranoia,

07:23.791 --> 07:26.576
hallucinations,
delusions.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.012
Before you know it,

07:28.056 --> 07:29.753
you got a highly combustible
situation down there.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.412
CLAUDE:
This is unbelievable.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.588
I mean, with
projects like this,

07:38.632 --> 07:41.461
y-you make contingencies
for every possible situation.

07:41.504 --> 07:43.767
Truly, I never could've
imagined that...

07:43.811 --> 07:44.986
DANNY:
Murder. Yeah, that's

07:45.029 --> 07:47.075
a crazy one.STEVE: Mr. Nostromo,

07:47.118 --> 07:48.642
when was the last time
you heard from the Neptune One?

07:48.685 --> 07:51.427
We lost contact 12 hours ago.I'm sorry, 12 hours?

07:51.471 --> 07:52.994
No, I mean, it's...
Because of the depth,

07:53.037 --> 07:55.126
it's not uncommon to go
several hours without contact,

07:55.170 --> 07:57.215
but usually the comms are
restored relatively quickly,

07:57.259 --> 07:59.217
which is...DANNY: I mean, given
the circumstances,

07:59.261 --> 08:01.002
uh, your communication problem's

08:01.045 --> 08:02.699
probably not
a coincidence, right?

08:02.743 --> 08:04.614
STEVE: Somebody just
killed Dr. Kamaka,

08:04.658 --> 08:06.529
so it's feasible
that the person responsible

08:06.573 --> 08:08.879
cut communication channels
to keep things quiet down there.

08:08.923 --> 08:11.403
Do you know anybody down there
who had a beef with him?

08:11.447 --> 08:13.449
No. All of these
scientists,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.886
I mean, underwent
a robust vetting process.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.497
STEVE:
Well, of course,

08:17.540 --> 08:19.542
but that vetting process goes
out the window if somebody's

08:19.586 --> 08:21.413
suffering from high-pressure
nervous syndrome, no?

08:21.457 --> 08:22.589
The ocean...

08:22.632 --> 08:24.025
it's our last great frontier.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.896
I mean, 95% of it
is still unexplored.

08:27.071 --> 08:30.205
And with all great
pioneering ventures,

08:30.248 --> 08:32.337
there's gonna be risks,
but there's no way of truly

08:32.381 --> 08:34.209
knowing how someone
will respond

08:34.252 --> 08:35.863
to that pressurized environment
until they're down there.

08:35.906 --> 08:38.430
I agree. I agree.
Anyway, first things first.

08:38.474 --> 08:39.997
We're gonna need
the personnel files

08:40.041 --> 08:41.564
of everybody down there, please.

08:41.608 --> 08:44.741
Sure. Of course, of course.
Um...

08:44.785 --> 08:48.092
Now, if you'll excuse me, uh,
I need to get on top of this.

08:48.136 --> 08:49.964
Hey, Gina? Will you
get me Reynolds?

08:50.007 --> 08:52.619
Does Reynolds have the files
that we need, or...?

08:52.662 --> 08:54.490
GINA : Sir,
I have Mr. Reynolds for you.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.665
Gina, just hold a second.

08:55.709 --> 08:58.450
Thank you so much.

08:58.494 --> 09:01.628
Excuse me?I have a crisis to manage.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.717
I have to deploy a sub
with a salvage-rescue team.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.545
Plus, I need to formulate
a PR response

09:05.588 --> 09:06.937
so I can get ahead
of this story.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.156
Excuse me,
Mr. Nostromo.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.679
I think you're missing
the real crisis here.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.725
I mean, the best-case
scenario is that...

09:11.768 --> 09:13.640
is that Dr. Kamaka
is the only victim,

09:13.683 --> 09:15.642
but we're not gonna know that
until we get down there.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.513
Down there?

09:17.557 --> 09:19.602
Yes, sir.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.865
Until we get down there
to your lab.

09:21.909 --> 09:23.258
Your lab is a crime scene,

09:23.301 --> 09:25.347
and everybody down
there is a suspect.

09:31.658 --> 09:34.617
TANI: Guys, meet our suspects,
the crew of the Neptune One.

09:34.661 --> 09:39.056
Jim Walker, Linda Brady,
Marcus Nash and Nina Kane.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.493
All of these people
are hand-picked by Nostromo

09:41.537 --> 09:43.278
for this mission.
Consider them,

09:43.321 --> 09:46.150
like, the dream team of
oceanographers and scientists.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.412
ADAM: And one of them
is a murderer.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.632
STEVE: That is our
working theory.

09:49.676 --> 09:52.287
So, we are gonna go down there,
assess the situation,

09:52.330 --> 09:54.289
collect evidence and
interview the suspects.

09:54.332 --> 09:56.465
Bad news is the sub
only carries three people.

09:56.508 --> 09:59.163
Oh. Well, I know who I nominate.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.557
Mm. Danny and I are actually
gonna run point

10:01.601 --> 10:02.602
on this one from up here.

10:02.645 --> 10:03.733
Oh.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.648
Junior's gonna take lead
on this mission.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.650
And, uh, he's gonna
take you two with.Okay.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.653
This is our ride down.
It's a three-person,

10:10.697 --> 10:12.655
one-atmosphere
submersible.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.483
We're gonna need
to take our time going down

10:14.526 --> 10:16.485
as the sub acclimates us
to the higher pressure

10:16.528 --> 10:18.661
of the lab, okay?
So you may experience

10:18.705 --> 10:21.055
some nausea and dizziness, and
that's just your body adjusting.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.970
STEVE: Right, the sub
is also equipped

10:23.013 --> 10:25.233
with a low-frequency antenna,
which means you guys

10:25.276 --> 10:27.583
should be able to communicate on
comms while you're down there.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.932
TANI:
What's happening with

10:28.976 --> 10:30.499
the Neptune's transmitter?
Is that still down?

10:30.542 --> 10:31.456
STEVE:
It is still down.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.980
Nobody's heard from the Neptune

10:33.023 --> 10:34.546
since right before
Dr. Kamaka was killed,

10:34.590 --> 10:36.679
which means we don't know
what we're walking into,

10:36.723 --> 10:37.637
which is why...

10:37.680 --> 10:40.901
you guys are
gonna take these.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.690
Stun guns, I presume.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.518
Yeah. Cute, right?

10:49.561 --> 10:50.780
Like any highly
pressurized environment,

10:50.824 --> 10:53.827
firearms would be too dangerous.

10:53.870 --> 10:56.699
So, we're gonna take these.
Any other questions?

10:56.743 --> 10:58.005
No. All set.

10:58.048 --> 11:00.398
Without further ado, be safe,
and, uh, Junior,

11:00.442 --> 11:02.226
don't, uh, do anything
I wouldn't do.

11:02.270 --> 11:04.185
Whoa. Talk about a blank check.

11:04.228 --> 11:06.143
All right. Hoo-yah.STEVE:
Hoo-yah.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.667
KAMAKA: Anyway, buddy,
I hope you're taking care

11:07.710 --> 11:09.494
of your mom for me.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.714
Don't get too used to being
the man of the house, though,

11:11.758 --> 11:16.893
because there's only 7,212
minutes left until I come home.

11:16.937 --> 11:20.723
You better believe I'm counting
down every single one.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.594
Love you.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.598
Jason sent these messages
every day,

11:26.642 --> 11:28.600
and that was
the last one that we got.

11:28.644 --> 11:32.779
Mrs. Kamaka, first of all,
we're very sorry for your loss.

11:32.822 --> 11:36.739
Uh, clearly, your husband was...
was a dedicated father, too.

11:36.783 --> 11:41.657
The only reason he took that job
was to help my son Kevin.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.094
See, he was recently diagnosed
with Gaucher disease.

11:44.138 --> 11:46.749
It's a genetic disorder.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.490
There's an experimental
treatment,

11:48.533 --> 11:51.580
and it's shown positive results
for Kevin, but...

11:51.623 --> 11:53.408
But insurance won't cover it?

11:55.192 --> 11:57.586
Nostromo offered three times
what Jason was making

11:57.629 --> 12:00.676
at the university, and Jason
said that it was the only way

12:00.720 --> 12:03.418
that we could afford
the next round of treatments.

12:03.461 --> 12:08.902
And I begged him not to go,
that we'd find another way.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.034
Let me talk to you
about Jason for a minute.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.689
During his time
on that lab,

12:13.733 --> 12:15.256
did he ever mention
anything to you

12:15.299 --> 12:17.040
about the other people
down there?

12:17.084 --> 12:18.607
Maybe he had a problem
with somebody,

12:18.650 --> 12:22.263
maybe he felt in danger
at some stage?

12:22.306 --> 12:24.700
Mm, he didn't talk much
about the work.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.354
I mean, he couldn't.

12:26.397 --> 12:29.705
Nostromo's lawyers had him sign
an NDA the size of a phonebook.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.709
And Jason knew that his
communications with the surface

12:33.753 --> 12:36.668
were being monitored.

12:36.712 --> 12:39.541
But, uh...

12:39.584 --> 12:41.456
What?

12:41.499 --> 12:45.634
The last time we spoke,
just, um, yesterday, actually,

12:45.677 --> 12:49.943
I could tell he was agitated,
and I asked what was wrong.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.640
And what did he say?

12:51.683 --> 12:56.166
Just that the job wasn't
what he had signed up for.

13:00.344 --> 13:03.826
From the day my son
was diagnosed,

13:03.870 --> 13:08.657
I've had to face the possibility
that I could lose him.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.137
But I never even thought

13:10.180 --> 13:14.184
what my life would be like
without Jason here.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.230
He's been my rock, you know?

13:20.582 --> 13:21.713
Mrs. Kamaka,

13:21.757 --> 13:23.846
we can't begin
to imagine

13:23.890 --> 13:25.761
what you and your son
have been through.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.154
But I can
only assume

13:27.197 --> 13:29.852
that you're not ready
to give up any time soon.

13:29.896 --> 13:30.853
Okay, well,

13:30.897 --> 13:32.812
neither are we.

14:25.821 --> 14:26.909
Okay, we're good.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.999
We've got
three percent oxygen,

14:30.043 --> 14:31.435
80% helium,

14:31.479 --> 14:33.133
and 17% nitrogen.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.353
Five suits, five tanks.

14:36.397 --> 14:39.226
That should mean everyone else
is still on board.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.010
Where's the welcoming party?

14:41.054 --> 14:42.707
Hey!

14:42.751 --> 14:44.057
Five-O! Identify yourself!

14:45.319 --> 14:47.843
Guys, I saw someone.

15:19.788 --> 15:20.789
ADAM:
Is that Kamaka's blood?

15:20.832 --> 15:22.225
No, it can't be.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.445
Kamaka was killed
over 12 hours ago.

15:24.488 --> 15:26.490
This looks fresh.

15:42.811 --> 15:43.943
JUNIOR:
Hey, you!

15:43.986 --> 15:45.509
Hand up right now!

15:45.553 --> 15:47.511
Get out here. Move.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.559
It's okay, buddy. We're Five-O.
We're here to help.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.126
You're Dr. Walker, right?

15:53.169 --> 15:54.997
Did you get him?

15:55.041 --> 15:56.390
Please tell me that you got him.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.000
Did we get who?
Wh-What happened to you?

15:58.044 --> 16:00.437
It was Nash. He attacked me.

16:00.481 --> 16:03.266
Dr. Marcus Nash?
Where is he now?

16:03.310 --> 16:05.007
I don't know. I...

16:05.051 --> 16:08.445
I woke up this morning,
and the power was out.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.665
Brady and Kane told me
that we'd been sabotaged,

16:10.708 --> 16:12.362
that the power and comms
were cut,

16:12.406 --> 16:15.235
and that Kamaka and Nash
were both missing.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.237
So we split up
to look for them,

16:17.280 --> 16:19.848
and that's when Nash came out
of nowhere and he attacked me.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.371
He was out of his mind.

16:21.415 --> 16:24.026
Somehow, I managed
to fend him off and get away.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.028
JUNIOR: Do you know
why he attacked you?

16:26.072 --> 16:27.377
Was it the
conditions in here?

16:27.421 --> 16:28.726
Was the atmosphere
getting to him?

16:28.770 --> 16:30.554
No, he was perfectly fine
until this morning.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.426
I have no idea what happened.
The guy just snapped.

16:32.469 --> 16:35.516
Wait.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.387
You mean you don't know
where he is?

16:37.431 --> 16:38.606
He's still out there?

16:38.649 --> 16:39.824
TANI:
Dr. Walker,

16:39.868 --> 16:40.869
Jason Kamaka's dead.

16:40.912 --> 16:43.480
His body washed ashore
this morning.

16:43.524 --> 16:44.960
ADAM: Based on
what you're telling us,

16:45.004 --> 16:47.528
it seems like Nash was
the one who killed him.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.095
Yeah. Hey, where's
the rest of your crew?

16:49.138 --> 16:50.313
I don't know.

16:50.357 --> 16:53.229
But we have to help them.

17:22.824 --> 17:26.958
Hey. Easy. Five-O.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.221
Jim?

17:34.227 --> 17:36.272
Hey, hey. Stop, stop.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.669
Clear.

17:41.712 --> 17:44.585
Can't... breathe...

17:44.628 --> 17:47.240
She's hyperventilating.
I think it's a panic attack.

17:47.283 --> 17:48.589
You guys have any oxygen?

17:48.632 --> 17:50.678
Just the dive tanks, but
they're all in the bay.

17:50.721 --> 17:53.159
And with Nash out
there, it's not safe.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.551
Did he attack you, too?

17:54.595 --> 17:55.465
BRADY: Didn't
have a chance.

17:55.509 --> 17:57.424
I locked myself in here.

17:57.467 --> 17:58.773
Kane did the same
in her cabin.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.166
But when her panic
attack started,

18:00.209 --> 18:02.298
she thought she could
get to the bay for a tank,

18:02.342 --> 18:05.127
but then she saw Nash,
so she detoured here.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.129
Guys, this needs stitches.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.565
There's a med kit
on that cart.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.962
She needs oxygen. We have to
get her the dive tanks.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.573
All right, listen up.
Adam, I want you to get

18:16.617 --> 18:18.227
Dr. Kane a tank, okay?
When you're down there,

18:18.271 --> 18:20.925
I want you to contact HQ
and request for an evac vessel

18:20.969 --> 18:22.144
A.S.A.P.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.537
The rest of y'all
are gonna stay in here

18:23.580 --> 18:26.366
and keep that door locked.
Okay. Tani, on me.

18:26.409 --> 18:27.802
Wait, where are you two going?

18:27.845 --> 18:29.673
To find Nash.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.999
Clear. Moving.Clear.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.708
Why is this hallway so short?

19:12.542 --> 19:15.110
Do you have the A.L.S.?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.807
Yeah.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.332
You looking
for blood?

19:19.375 --> 19:22.378
No. Something else.

19:24.859 --> 19:27.601
Fingerprints.

19:27.644 --> 19:29.646
I think
there's something behind here.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.593
Well, the stun guns work.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.604
Um, Joons.

20:14.648 --> 20:17.607
We got weird-looking stuff
in a secret room.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.566
You know how Nostromo said

20:19.609 --> 20:21.176
that they were studying
the lava flow?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.960
JUNIOR:
Yeah.

20:23.004 --> 20:25.441
I'm thinking that was a lie,

20:25.485 --> 20:27.878
'cause these
aren't lava rocks.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.105
STEVE: All right, Tani.
According to the geologist

20:37.148 --> 20:40.108
we spoke to at Oahu State,
those rocks that you found,

20:40.151 --> 20:42.197
they are a rare earth element

20:42.241 --> 20:43.938
called yttrium.

20:43.981 --> 20:45.287
Safe to say Nostromo
isn't collecting them

20:45.331 --> 20:47.028
because they're shiny
and pretty.

20:47.071 --> 20:48.203
GROVER:
No, you got that right.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.336
This yttrium's worth
more than gold.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.338
And it's a key component

20:52.381 --> 20:55.428
for microprocessors, microchips,
mobile chipsets.

20:55.471 --> 20:58.126
All things made
by Nostromo's company,

20:58.169 --> 21:00.128
so he's keeping them pockets
nice and fat.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.304
And I'll tell you
something else. China?

21:02.348 --> 21:04.567
They have the market cornered
on this stuff.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.003
So he's prospecting.

21:06.047 --> 21:07.222
STEVE: You better believe
he's prospecting.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.615
And let me tell you
something else.

21:08.658 --> 21:11.574
If Nostromo finds
his own reserve of yttrium,

21:11.618 --> 21:14.185
we're talking about
billions of dollars in profits.

21:14.229 --> 21:17.667
Well, ill-gained profits, as it
is illegal to mine the waters

21:17.711 --> 21:19.408
that are claimed
by the State of Hawaii.

21:19.452 --> 21:20.975
So the whole lava flow study,

21:21.018 --> 21:24.152
that was just a cover for
this illegal yttrium operation?

21:24.195 --> 21:26.154
I mean, it would make sense
why Kamaka

21:26.197 --> 21:27.547
told his wife that the job
wasn't exactly

21:27.590 --> 21:29.200
what he had signed up for.

21:29.244 --> 21:31.986
GROVER: Yeah, but he wasn't
the only one who got misled.

21:32.029 --> 21:35.511
Nostromo gave us
his CCTV coverage,

21:35.555 --> 21:38.514
all the stuff that was recorded
before the comms went out.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.124
Well, what a surprise.

21:40.168 --> 21:41.952
That secret room you found?

21:41.996 --> 21:43.824
No footage to be found on there,

21:43.867 --> 21:46.609
but you can still see
who was going down the hallway.

21:46.653 --> 21:49.003
Same two crew members
every night,

21:49.046 --> 21:50.831
except, of course,
for last night,

21:50.874 --> 21:52.920
when we had a new member
going down there.

21:52.963 --> 21:55.357
Yeah. Our victim,
Jason Kamaka.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.620
TANI:
Hold on, you said two scientists

21:57.664 --> 21:59.405
knew about the hidden room?

21:59.448 --> 22:02.277
We know Nash was one of them,
because we found him in there.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.061
But who was the other one?

22:06.194 --> 22:08.152
Care to explain, Dr. Brady?

22:08.196 --> 22:10.067
I... I don't know what that is.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.331
Oh, that-that was convincing.JUNIOR: Yeah.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.289
See, we have video footage
of you and Nash

22:14.333 --> 22:16.509
walking up and down that hallway
every night

22:16.552 --> 22:18.162
with yttrium samples.

22:18.206 --> 22:20.556
We also know Dr. Kamaka found
out about that room last night.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.994
So all that's left to sort out
is whether Nash acted alone

22:24.038 --> 22:26.519
in killing Kamaka, or if you
had a hand in that, too.

22:26.562 --> 22:27.737
WALKER:
Brady,

22:27.781 --> 22:29.348
what the hell
are they talking about?

22:29.391 --> 22:31.175
Is this true?

22:31.219 --> 22:32.786
Nostromo sent me and Nash
down here

22:32.829 --> 22:35.179
on a different mission
than the rest of you.

22:35.223 --> 22:37.704
We were mapping the ocean floor for yttrium deposits.

22:37.747 --> 22:40.184
The samples we collected
were supposed to help Nostromo

22:40.228 --> 22:41.577
figure out
where to mine for it.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.187
Right, and then
the mission was compromised

22:43.231 --> 22:45.102
when Kamaka found out about it,

22:45.146 --> 22:46.669
and then he
confronted you.

22:46.713 --> 22:47.844
It was you. You killed him.

22:47.888 --> 22:49.455
BRADY: No, no!
I swear. I...

22:49.498 --> 22:52.458
I didn't even know he'd
found out about the samples.

22:52.501 --> 22:56.462
I didn't kill Jason Kamaka,
and neither did Nash.

22:56.505 --> 22:57.898
KANE:
She's lying.

22:57.941 --> 22:59.421
I saw Nash with the knife.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.597
He was about to kill Walker.

23:01.641 --> 23:03.382
No, Nash didn't kill Kamaka.
He couldn't have.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.775
He was working with me
all night, and I can prove it.

23:05.819 --> 23:07.386
Sit down. Sit down.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.083
Just hand me that tablet.

23:09.126 --> 23:10.301
Please.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.263
Every evening,

23:15.306 --> 23:16.699
we input the mapping data
into the system.

23:16.743 --> 23:18.571
We were up all of last night
because we finally

23:18.614 --> 23:20.181
finished our research.

23:20.224 --> 23:22.488
Nash and I have
distinctive log-ins,

23:22.531 --> 23:26.013
and every entry
is time-stamped, so...

23:26.056 --> 23:27.928
Wait. This can't be right.

23:27.971 --> 23:30.626
The data, the maps.
Everything's gone.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.498
The system's been wiped.

23:32.541 --> 23:33.629
Do you expect us
to believe that?

23:33.673 --> 23:35.065
It's true.

23:35.109 --> 23:37.067
Except, if you and Nash
were the only ones

23:37.111 --> 23:40.244
who knew about the data, then
who else could have erased it?

23:40.288 --> 23:42.029
Nostromo.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.639
WALKER:
Oh, he's awake.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.075
JUNIOR:
Listen up.

23:45.119 --> 23:47.687
What do you mean?
Why would Nostromo do that?

23:47.730 --> 23:48.557
WALKER: Wait,
you're not actually

23:48.601 --> 23:49.906
gonna listen
to this lunatic,

23:49.950 --> 23:50.951
are you?

23:50.994 --> 23:52.605
Mm-hmm.

23:52.648 --> 23:56.913
Be clear.To cover his tracks.

23:56.957 --> 23:59.307
When I logged on this morning,
the data was gone.

23:59.350 --> 24:03.180
I thought maybe the drives
had been corrupted,

24:03.224 --> 24:06.967
or that one of us had
wiped them accidentally.

24:07.010 --> 24:11.188
Then I realized Kamaka was
missing, and it all made sense.

24:11.232 --> 24:14.191
Nostromo was
covering his tracks.

24:14.235 --> 24:16.455
If he could have Kamaka killed,
then we were all expendable.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.065
TANI:
So you're saying

24:18.108 --> 24:20.241
that he was gonna kill
everybody in the lab?

24:20.284 --> 24:22.939
Do you have any idea how much
money he put into this plan?

24:22.983 --> 24:26.029
If Kamaka threatened to expose
it, then having him killed

24:26.073 --> 24:29.424
was nothing more
than a business expense.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.035
Truth is, with the data mapping
nearly complete,

24:32.079 --> 24:34.342
Nostromo didn't need
any of us anymore.

24:34.385 --> 24:37.214
Just knowing about this
made us a liability to him.

24:37.258 --> 24:39.042
Is that why you had that knife?

24:39.086 --> 24:40.783
Why you were acting
all paranoid?

24:40.827 --> 24:42.219
I didn't know
who to trust.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.786
I still don't.

24:44.831 --> 24:46.397
A-All I know

24:46.441 --> 24:49.009
is that whoever Nostromo
sent after Kamaka

24:49.052 --> 24:50.967
could be coming for me next.

24:51.011 --> 24:53.535
Joons.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.413
So I still think he's crazy.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.372
Um, but is he maybe
a little less so?

25:04.415 --> 25:05.547
ADAM: Guys, we're
talking about

25:05.591 --> 25:07.418
a billion-dollar
investment here.

25:07.462 --> 25:08.245
If Nostromo thought

25:08.289 --> 25:09.856
that was in jeopardy,

25:09.899 --> 25:12.380
I'm not sure there's much
he wouldn't do to protect it.

25:14.425 --> 25:16.253
What happened to Dr. Kamaka
is a tragedy,

25:16.297 --> 25:17.341
but that doesn't excuse
you making

25:17.385 --> 25:18.560
wild, baseless accusations.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.562
I'm sorry, base...
you said "baseless"?

25:20.606 --> 25:22.564
Somebody killed him,
you understand?

25:22.608 --> 25:26.002
And you, you are the one
with billions on the line.

25:26.046 --> 25:29.179
I say this fully realizing
how it sounds:

25:29.223 --> 25:32.400
Do you know how
much money I have?

25:32.443 --> 25:34.533
It's enough
for a thousand lifetimes,

25:34.576 --> 25:36.578
and that's living really well.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.580
All you super rich
guys are the same.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.190
There's never enough money.

25:40.234 --> 25:41.322
Because if there was,

25:41.365 --> 25:43.280
you'd stop at just being
regular rich.

25:43.324 --> 25:45.195
Money is just a means to an end.

25:45.239 --> 25:46.109
It's a way to make dreams

25:46.153 --> 25:47.328
like the Neptune
into reality.

25:47.371 --> 25:50.418
Dr. Kamaka shared my dreams.

25:50.461 --> 25:51.811
He was a man of science.

25:51.854 --> 25:53.943
He shared my passion
for the betterment of humanity.

25:53.987 --> 25:55.423
GROVER: Or you could
just cut the crap

25:55.466 --> 25:57.947
about the betterment of
humanity "Kumbaya" stuff

25:57.991 --> 25:59.601
since we already know
about the yttrium.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.560
STEVE: Okay,
here's the facts.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.736
You were conducting
secretive and highly illegal

26:03.779 --> 26:05.781
mining operations down there.

26:05.825 --> 26:09.002
The night that Jason Kamaka
finds out about it, he's killed,

26:09.045 --> 26:12.092
and then somebody goes ahead
and wipes all the data.

26:12.135 --> 26:13.920
So, unless you
can explain to us

26:13.963 --> 26:16.052
who else would be trying
to cover their tracks...

26:16.096 --> 26:18.011
Wait, hold on.

26:18.054 --> 26:20.317
Did you say someone
just wiped the drives?GROVER: Here's the part

26:20.361 --> 26:22.189
where he pretends
to be surprised.No. You don't understand.

26:22.232 --> 26:24.191
There's no backup for that data.
Not in my office,

26:24.234 --> 26:25.888
not in the cloud, not anywhere.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.455
What?

26:27.498 --> 26:30.676
You really expect us to believe
that some tech whiz genius

26:30.719 --> 26:33.287
forgot to back up
his billion-dollar data?

26:33.330 --> 26:34.375
It's by design.

26:34.418 --> 26:36.203
The computers on the lab
are air-gapped

26:36.246 --> 26:39.032
to prevent them from being
hacked, which means that no one

26:39.075 --> 26:40.990
can access them remotely,
including me.

26:41.034 --> 26:42.426
So if someone
wiped those drives,

26:42.470 --> 26:44.298
it had to be done
down at the lab.

26:44.341 --> 26:45.516
Explain something to me.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.954
Why would anybody else erase
that drive?

26:47.997 --> 26:49.608
Well, there's
only one reason:

26:49.651 --> 26:52.045
to keep the data away from me
and sell it on the open market.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.307
There are foreign interests

26:53.350 --> 26:55.135
who would pay hundreds
of millions for it.

26:55.178 --> 26:57.093
Oh, well, easy
come, easy go.

26:57.137 --> 26:58.268
Looks like you've been had.

26:58.312 --> 26:59.792
I think I know by whom.

26:59.835 --> 27:02.011
Go on.I have an inside man
down there,

27:02.055 --> 27:04.144
someone I sent
for the sole purpose

27:04.187 --> 27:05.928
of keeping an eye on the others.

27:05.972 --> 27:09.018
You know, prevent this
exact thing from happening.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.411
We're gonna need a name.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.675
All right.

27:17.244 --> 27:19.072
Bleeding stopped.

27:19.115 --> 27:21.248
No sign of infection,
but he doesn't look well.

27:21.291 --> 27:24.077
I think the conditions
are getting to him.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.688
All right. Well, I need you to
just keep an eye on him, okay?

27:26.732 --> 27:28.559
The evac vessel is an hour out.

27:29.996 --> 27:32.433
Uh, I'm not feeling
so great myself.

27:32.476 --> 27:34.261
Is this that dizziness
you warned us about,

27:34.304 --> 27:35.479
as our bodies adjust?

27:35.523 --> 27:37.090
Yeah. Yeah.

27:37.133 --> 27:41.703
Yeah, it has to be. I mean...
I mean, we just got here.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.357
But Walker, he...

27:43.400 --> 27:45.838
he should have adjusted
a long time ago.

27:45.881 --> 27:47.883
Unless...

27:49.972 --> 27:51.147
Huh?
What are you doing?

27:51.191 --> 27:52.758
I saw you check the air
when we got here.

27:52.801 --> 27:53.976
You said it was fine.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.587
Yeah, well, not anymore. Look.

27:56.631 --> 27:58.241
The oxygen levels are dropping
to one percent.

27:58.285 --> 28:02.811
Anything below that
is dangerously hypoxic.

28:02.855 --> 28:05.466
So someone tampered with
the levels after we got here.

28:05.509 --> 28:08.034
Yeah, but why would you mess
with the levels if that means

28:08.077 --> 28:10.558
that you're affected, too?

28:10.601 --> 28:12.995
ADAM: Except,
not everyone's affected.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.086
TANI:
Guys,

28:17.130 --> 28:19.436
McGarrett spoke to Nostromo.

28:19.480 --> 28:22.178
There is a third person
who knows about the yttrium.

28:22.222 --> 28:23.266
They also have motive
to kill Kamaka.

28:26.226 --> 28:28.097
Hey!

28:28.141 --> 28:31.274
Stay back.
Against the booths, now!

28:35.496 --> 28:36.671
Stay back.

28:36.715 --> 28:37.890
Easy, easy.

28:49.249 --> 28:51.251
Okay, Tani, I want you
to contact McGarrett

28:51.294 --> 28:52.469
and let him know
what's going on.

28:52.513 --> 28:54.471
We can't. The comms are down.

28:54.515 --> 28:56.169
We're too far
from the sub antenna.

28:56.212 --> 28:58.475
We... we got to get
to the moon pool.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.782
It's barricaded. We got
to break it. Ready? On three.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.089
One, two, three.

29:03.132 --> 29:04.873
Again.

29:04.917 --> 29:06.353
Two, three.

29:13.403 --> 29:15.710
Oh, she's taking
the submersible.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.322
McGarrett?

29:19.366 --> 29:20.541
McGarrett, do you read?

29:20.584 --> 29:23.152
No. Without the sub,
the comms are gone.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.198
Yeah, along with
our only way off this lab.

29:37.297 --> 29:38.559
Sub's gone.

29:38.602 --> 29:39.778
TANI: I'm guessing
whatever Kane's

29:39.821 --> 29:42.519
exfil plan was
after killing Kamaka

29:42.563 --> 29:44.086
changed when we got here.

29:44.130 --> 29:45.392
At which point,

29:45.435 --> 29:47.350
taking our sub
became her best way off the lab.

29:47.394 --> 29:49.265
It looks like
she didn't want anyone

29:49.309 --> 29:50.440
getting off
the lab, period.

29:50.484 --> 29:53.792
Almost all the oxygen
supply is gone.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.184
TANI: Joons,
exactly how much

29:55.228 --> 29:57.578
breathable air do we have left?

29:57.621 --> 29:59.580
Well, if we keep
all our activity levels

29:59.623 --> 30:01.103
down to a minimum,

30:01.147 --> 30:04.977
I'm guessing
at least 40 minutes to an hour.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.547
Hey, yo!

30:10.591 --> 30:13.420
Hey, I just tried calling you.
We got a problem.What?

30:13.463 --> 30:15.422
The GPS on the sub
showed movement, right?

30:15.465 --> 30:17.467
So Nostromo's people tried
to get in touch with them,

30:17.511 --> 30:19.600
and-and nothing. Th-The comms
just stopped transmitting.

30:19.643 --> 30:21.123
Did you try to contact them?

30:21.167 --> 30:22.777
Several times, got nothing.GROVER: Well,
sound to me

30:22.821 --> 30:24.039
like they've been jacked,
which means

30:24.083 --> 30:25.606
our guys are down there
stranded or worse.

30:25.649 --> 30:28.217
Danny, come with me.
Lou, send me the coordinates

30:28.261 --> 30:29.958
of the Neptune to my phone,
please. And how far away

30:30.002 --> 30:32.526
is that Coast Guard
evac vessel?I'll hit them up and find out.

30:32.569 --> 30:33.875
All right, tell them
me and Danny are gonna meet them

30:33.919 --> 30:35.311
at the dive site,
and, Lou, tell them to hurry.

30:35.355 --> 30:37.357
Yes, sir.

30:45.104 --> 30:47.584
Sorry, what are you
looking for exactly?

30:47.628 --> 30:49.195
Because unless
it's a secret cache

30:49.238 --> 30:52.024
of oxygen, I don't see
the point in exerting yourself.

30:57.551 --> 31:00.075
This is a transmission buoy.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.121
We can put a message on it,

31:02.164 --> 31:03.992
and then we send it up
to the surface.

31:04.036 --> 31:07.343
It'll broadcast our SOS
to all emergency frequencies.

31:07.387 --> 31:09.171
Joons, by the time someone
catches that signal

31:09.215 --> 31:11.565
and sends a crew down...I know.
It's a Hail Mary,

31:11.608 --> 31:13.045
but it's our best shot.

31:17.484 --> 31:20.530
Mayday. Mayday.

31:20.574 --> 31:24.143
This is Officer Junior Reigns
with the Five-O Task Force

31:24.186 --> 31:26.580
in urgent need of assistance.

31:26.623 --> 31:29.104
We are six people
stranded on board

31:29.148 --> 31:32.673
the Neptune One underwater lab.

31:34.588 --> 31:39.549
At 1605, we have roughly
37 minutes left of usable air.

31:39.593 --> 31:43.075
Lab coordinates,
north: 21 degrees,

31:43.118 --> 31:46.252
26 tack 927,

31:46.295 --> 31:47.862
west:

31:47.906 --> 31:49.603
157 degrees,

31:49.646 --> 31:52.649
62 tack 179.

31:53.824 --> 31:57.219
Depth of 127 meters.

31:57.263 --> 32:01.136
Please contact the
Five-O Task Force.

32:01.180 --> 32:04.792
Please send help. Over.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.841
Wait, Joons.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.887
I'm gonna go. Let me go.

32:14.628 --> 32:17.283
No. Look at you.

32:17.326 --> 32:20.460
You can barely stand up.

32:20.503 --> 32:23.376
You don't look too hot yourself.

32:25.204 --> 32:27.206
I'll be back.

33:45.501 --> 33:47.721
Thanks.

33:47.764 --> 33:50.550
I got disoriented.Yeah.

33:50.593 --> 33:54.119
You can get me dinner
when we're out of here.

33:54.162 --> 33:56.382
I want sushi.

33:56.425 --> 33:58.645
Okay? Like,
really expensive sushi.

33:58.688 --> 34:00.168
Hey.

34:00.212 --> 34:02.736
I went to go to see
my dad this morning.

34:05.652 --> 34:06.566
It sucked.

34:06.609 --> 34:09.656
I'm sorry.

34:09.699 --> 34:10.700
It's okay.

34:12.615 --> 34:15.053
Turns out that's the best
part of my day.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.619
Oh.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.150
DANNY:
Slow down a little bit.

34:25.193 --> 34:26.542
Slow down.
The GPS says

34:26.586 --> 34:28.675
you're right
on top of the lab.

34:28.718 --> 34:29.719
Stop.
All right.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.724
There's the
Coast Guard boat.

34:34.768 --> 34:37.292
That's good. They should
have a diving bell.

34:37.336 --> 34:38.641
I'll go down
with the rescue team.

34:38.685 --> 34:40.513
We don't even know what's
going on down there.

34:40.556 --> 34:42.384
They could be dead,
for all we know.Hey, hey. Stop.

34:42.428 --> 34:44.430
Please don't do that.
Okay?

34:44.473 --> 34:46.606
I'm anxious, too.
We need to stay positive.

34:46.649 --> 34:49.174
So keep your mind on the rescue
and not think like that, please.

34:52.655 --> 34:53.917
Is that the phone?

34:56.050 --> 34:58.357
GROVER: Hey, it's Grover.Hey, Lou.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.533
What's up?So, a fishing trawler

35:00.576 --> 35:02.578
just picked up
an SOS message from Junior.

35:02.622 --> 35:04.276
Somehow, the kid got
a transmission out.

35:04.319 --> 35:05.625
My man.

35:05.668 --> 35:08.149
Look, it's bad.
He says they're running out

35:08.193 --> 35:09.890
of breathable air.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.718
There's six of them down there.

35:11.761 --> 35:13.372
Down to 37 minutes.

35:13.415 --> 35:16.940
Only, the transmission
was recorded at 1605.

35:17.637 --> 35:19.029
That's 31 minutes ago.

35:19.073 --> 35:21.031
They got six minutes'
worth of air?

35:21.075 --> 35:22.903
Which means, by the time
that vessel gets here

35:22.946 --> 35:24.513
and launches that evac op,
it's gonna be too late.

35:32.565 --> 35:35.568
What are you doing now, Beautiful Mind,
huh?I'm doing the math.

35:35.611 --> 35:37.439
We got two dive tanks,
they're both 80s,

35:37.483 --> 35:41.139
which means we've got 160
cubic feet of trimix, right?

35:41.182 --> 35:42.444
Which breaks down
to approximately

35:42.488 --> 35:44.272
112 minutes of breathable air.

35:44.316 --> 35:46.535
Divide that by the six people
that are underneath this,

35:46.579 --> 35:48.320
you got a little over
18 minutes each.

35:48.363 --> 35:50.583
If they take turns, they should
be able to ration the air

35:50.626 --> 35:52.324
in these two tanks
and make it last

35:52.367 --> 35:54.282
when the Coast Guard
gets here with more air.

35:54.326 --> 35:56.589
That's great, but the tanks are
up here, so what I imagine is,

35:56.632 --> 35:58.678
you're gonna swim
those tanks down there?

35:58.721 --> 35:59.940
What, you got a better idea?

35:59.983 --> 36:02.290
No.
Call the Coast Guard,
tell that vessel

36:02.334 --> 36:03.683
they need to be here--
they got 18 minutes

36:03.726 --> 36:06.599
to get here and get more
air down to these people.

36:06.642 --> 36:07.861
Your math is goofy, okay?

36:07.904 --> 36:09.384
You got to use some
of the air yourself,

36:09.428 --> 36:11.604
you got to go down there,
you're gonna leave the tanks,

36:11.647 --> 36:12.735
come back up,
what about you?

36:12.779 --> 36:14.128
What about your air, huh?

36:14.172 --> 36:16.261
Danny, the best chance
of survival for these guys

36:16.304 --> 36:17.697
is if I free-dive
these tanks down, okay?

36:17.740 --> 36:19.394
Now, I got the weight
of the tanks.

36:19.438 --> 36:20.917
It's gonna help
get me down there.

36:20.961 --> 36:24.225
Ideally, I'd have some kind
of guideline, but I don't.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.401
Why don't you use the anchor?There's no way the anchor's

36:26.445 --> 36:28.316
gonna reach 130 meters, Danny.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.276
There's no way you're gonna make
130 meters, either.

36:31.319 --> 36:32.799
Let's just be real
for a second.

36:32.842 --> 36:34.714
You go down there,
you're gonna have to hit

36:34.757 --> 36:36.368
a little bit of air, you know?

36:36.411 --> 36:39.240
Then what? How are you not gonna
explode when you come back up?

36:39.284 --> 36:40.763
I'm gonna exhale all
of it on the ascent.

36:40.807 --> 36:43.157
But listen, if I get back
to this boat and I look

36:43.201 --> 36:44.941
like a potato, you got
ten minutes to get me

36:44.985 --> 36:46.247
to a hyperbaric chamber,
all right?

36:46.291 --> 36:48.031
Do me a favor,
drag this over here.

36:49.642 --> 36:52.035
Come on.

37:11.968 --> 37:13.666
Steve...
Uh-uh.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.494
No pep talks.
Besides, you suck at them.

37:15.537 --> 37:17.322
Thank you.

38:37.706 --> 38:39.882
Rescue team,
15 minutes.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.884
I can't stay.

38:41.928 --> 38:44.496
Not enough air. Understand?

38:45.932 --> 38:47.586
Make this last.

38:47.629 --> 38:49.239
I got to go.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.764
Stay calm.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.733
One for the road.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.778
Steve!

40:21.680 --> 40:23.421
You okay?

40:23.464 --> 40:24.987
Huh?

40:25.031 --> 40:27.250
Everybody else, they okay?

40:29.035 --> 40:30.428
Rescue team?

40:30.471 --> 40:32.604
Oh. They'll be there
in ten minutes. It's all good.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.653
Don't ever, ever do that
to me again, please.

40:38.697 --> 40:41.613
Now that I know you can
hold your breath that long,

40:41.656 --> 40:42.962
I don't want
to hear you complain

40:43.005 --> 40:44.485
when I bring takeout
into the car.

40:44.529 --> 40:46.531
Okay?

41:02.938 --> 41:04.940
GROVER:
Thank you.

41:07.116 --> 41:08.683
Hey.
Hey.

41:08.727 --> 41:11.469
Well, I got some very good news
on our murderess, Nina Kane.

41:11.512 --> 41:12.644
What's up?

41:12.687 --> 41:14.210
Well, the United States Navy
tracked her sub,

41:14.254 --> 41:15.516
led us right
to her dealer.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.039
Wait a minute,
we got her in custody?

41:17.083 --> 41:18.519
Oh, no.
No, she's in ICU.

41:18.563 --> 41:21.000
In her haste
to surface

41:21.043 --> 41:24.525
and collect on her payday,
she gave herself the bends.

41:24.569 --> 41:26.962
Wow. Karma really is a bitch
sometimes, huh?

41:27.006 --> 41:29.704
We got some good news, too.
Uh, Nostromo is gonna do

41:29.748 --> 41:31.532
the right thing
and, uh, take care

41:31.576 --> 41:32.707
of our vic's kid's
medical bills.

41:32.751 --> 41:34.143
STEVE:
Even the experimental

41:34.187 --> 41:36.319
gene therapy treatments.
Kid's covered for life.

41:36.363 --> 41:39.192
That's the least he can
do with his rich ass.

41:39.235 --> 41:40.672
STEVE: Well, and
assist the Feds

41:40.715 --> 41:43.544
in their investigation
of his illegal mining operation.

41:44.676 --> 41:45.981
Look who's back
from the abyss.

41:46.025 --> 41:47.417
STEVE:
Hey.

41:47.461 --> 41:49.332
GROVER: Well, look who
survived the decompression.

41:49.376 --> 41:51.639
We did, yeah.
16 hours.

41:51.683 --> 41:54.686
16 hours stuck in a hyperbaric--

41:54.729 --> 41:56.601
I'm sorry, scratch that--
hyper-barbaric chamber

41:56.644 --> 41:58.603
with, um,
Adam and Joons

41:58.646 --> 42:00.518
arguing about
what's better,

42:00.561 --> 42:02.868
cartoons or anime.It's anime.

42:02.911 --> 42:04.652
Oh, cartoons. Come on.Help me.

42:04.696 --> 42:06.654
Hey, where's Junior?

42:06.698 --> 42:08.177
Junior said he would
be in later.

42:08.221 --> 42:09.875
He just has to take care
of something first.

42:09.918 --> 42:11.311
Okay.
