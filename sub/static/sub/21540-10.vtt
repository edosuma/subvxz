07:56.743 --> 07:58.878
Can it be a hot Colombian?

07:58.912 --> 08:01.247
- Um, no.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.882
- Okay.
- [laughing]

08:02.916 --> 08:05.218
<i>- We're not talking</i>

08:05.251 --> 08:08.888
I may need a partner

08:08.922 --> 08:11.725
that could help me focus on
the things that I'm good at.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.326
Ronnie, I love you.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.812
When I got the building,
it was one of the best

08:32.846 --> 08:34.814
professional moments ever.

08:34.848 --> 08:38.084

<i>It's a four-unit</i>
<i>boutique building</i>

08:43.556 --> 08:45.058
<i>in the middle of Tribeca</i>

08:45.091 --> 08:48.261

unreal finishes

08:48.294 --> 08:49.529
<i>I have ever seen.</i>

08:49.562 --> 08:51.064
- There's a rain sensor
outside every window.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.599
- That's insane.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.335
<i>I already sold one of the units</i>
<i>after my first open house,</i>

08:55.368 --> 08:57.437
and then the seller
rejected another offer

08:57.470 --> 08:59.072
that I had on one
of the other units.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.407
- No way under the sun.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.309
That's, like, the worst offer
I've ever seen.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.713
- Now I'm nervous that if I
don't sell at least one more

09:06.746 --> 09:08.214
really, really quickly...

09:08.248 --> 09:09.482
Yo.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.551
That they will lose their
patience with me, too,

09:11.584 --> 09:13.887
just like they lost their
patience with Fredrik.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.690
How many RSVPs do we have?
- 40 to 50.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.125
- And so the same RSVP list
we talked about, right?

09:19.159 --> 09:20.894
When I launched the building,

09:20.927 --> 09:24.064
I had a party for 500 people,

09:24.097 --> 09:26.666
<i>which is great,</i>
<i>but, in real estate,</i>

09:26.700 --> 09:28.802
you can't do
the same thing twice.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.136
[elevator dings]
Hi.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.137
Welcome.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.138
Hi.
- Hi.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.173
Thanks for coming.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.274
You can just make your way in.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.409
<i>Tonight is a much</i>
<i>more intimate,</i>

09:36.443 --> 09:38.545
selected gathering

09:38.578 --> 09:40.714
of people that I have
hand-picked personally.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.749
So there are brochures
and show sheets.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.751
<i>I need to be able to do</i>
<i>individual tours.</i>

09:44.784 --> 09:46.686
It's all about
personal attention.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.921
- So how many units
are left here?

09:47.954 --> 09:49.222
- There's four units total.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.524
One is sold, and then we have
the fourth-floor duplex.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.360
<i>And then we have a big</i>
<i>townhouse downstairs.</i>

09:53.393 --> 09:54.828
And then we have this,
the penthouse,

09:54.861 --> 09:56.129
which we're really
pushing tonight.

09:56.162 --> 09:58.598
I mean, it's--it's not quite
4,000 square feet,

09:58.631 --> 09:59.699
but it feels like it,

09:59.733 --> 10:01.101
because it's spread out
over three floors.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.236
- Wow, this is amazing.
- Isn't it cool?

10:03.269 --> 10:05.805
<i>The details in this apartment</i>
<i>are completely crazy.</i>

10:05.839 --> 10:08.375
All the speakers drop down
and, like, follow you,

10:08.408 --> 10:09.809
so the sound is always perfect.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.111
- This is an amazing unit.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.245
- You want to see the roof?

10:12.278 --> 10:14.614
It's great for parties.
- Let's go.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.616
This is unbelievable.
- Isn't this cool?

10:16.649 --> 10:17.951
- You have no--
nothing blocking you.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.986
- This guy, a long time ago,
bought those air rights.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.187
This guy bought
those air rights.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.322
- Ridiculous.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.990
- May I ask what
you're asking for it?

10:24.024 --> 10:26.026
- $9 million.

10:28.595 --> 10:32.265
- Thank you.
- Awesome.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.299
- It's a little aggressive.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.735
- Jason priced this
place too high.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.370
- I got to do
a little thinking.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.738
- There's nothing
with the building.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.306
There's no doorman,
there's no amenities.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.841
There is nothing.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.510
<i>We should be less expensive.</i>

10:43.543 --> 10:45.612
In Tribeca, most people don't
buy in Tribeca for views.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.147
- Right on.
- And the views here are wild.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.381
- I suppose.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.749
- But I'll--I'll, uh--
oh, hey.

10:49.783 --> 10:50.984
- What's up?
- I didn't know you were coming.

10:51.017 --> 10:52.018
- How are you?

10:52.052 --> 10:54.187
- Good.
- Good.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.689
- This is why I'm stressed,

10:55.722 --> 10:57.390
because these developers--
they show up to everything.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.692
- How you doing?

10:58.725 --> 10:59.859
<i>- Like, it's--</i>
<i>I'm on, like, a date.</i>

10:59.893 --> 11:01.761
And, like, you know,
my date's dad

11:01.795 --> 11:04.064
is, like, standing there
in the corner staring at me.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.231
So I'll--I'll grab you
in a second.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.366
- Yeah,
sounds good.

11:06.399 --> 11:07.467
- Yeah, I'll take you
downstairs.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.501
- Check out the stairs.
- Okay, cool.

11:08.535 --> 11:09.969
- Thanks.
- How's it going?

11:10.070 --> 11:11.104
- It's good.

11:11.137 --> 11:12.572
- Do you think this is--
this generates sales?

11:12.605 --> 11:13.773
- Yeah, of course.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.275
Remember, this one
is invitation-only.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.810
These are very,
very specific people.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.178
These are art buyers.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.879
They're people who want
big, downtown loft space.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.115
They want--
- Just get it sold.

11:22.148 --> 11:23.883
I just need to see
a contract signed.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.985
This is like--I have nightmares
about this building.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.355
- I'm doing everything I can.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.456
I mean, if I thought
that, like--

11:29.489 --> 11:31.424
- Maybe not everything.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.259
<i>- If they're willing</i>
<i>to fire one person,</i>

11:33.293 --> 11:35.729
they're willing to fire you too.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.331
So should I be doing a big party
to get more people through?

11:38.365 --> 11:39.332
I don't know.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.333
- So what do you think?

11:40.367 --> 11:41.368
Are you gonna
sell it all tonight?

11:41.401 --> 11:44.137
- Um, but these are very, very--

11:44.170 --> 11:45.505
- You need to get--
get a move on.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.236
- Well, it's actually
an essential oil.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.639
- Well, yes.

12:19.673 --> 12:20.940

I'm talking about.

My assistant is, like,
the quirkiest of the quirky.

Okay, that's new, fresh.
Okay.

Uh, I hope there's a lot
of people coming today.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.548
- Of course.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.783
- And you know,
we have to sell it,

12:29.816 --> 12:31.084
because she's also looking
to buy something else.

12:31.117 --> 12:32.719
- Well, yes.
It's essential.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.621
[doorbell rings]
- Okay, people here.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.623
I've been a little
bit concerned.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.992
You know, a $7 million
apartment on the second floor--

12:39.092 --> 12:40.794
there's always less buyers.

Wow!

13:11.624 --> 13:12.892
- Look at the color she chose.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.894
- This is the reason
I moved to New York.

Look at this--they don't make
buildings like this anymore.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.631
They cannot recreate this.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.133
They cannot rebuild
something like this.

- Stunning.

- Do you think it
gets noisy here?

- Noisy?
- It's second floor.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.506
- No, no, no, no.
There's no noise.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.105

13:59.139 --> 14:01.274
And when it's sold,
it will never come back.

- The architecture is gorgeous.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.277
- So beautiful.
- Yes.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.745
- But honestly,

14:11.951 --> 14:14.187

14:15.855 --> 14:17.123
I totally see a vagina.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.892
- Oh, okay.

Hi, how are you?

14:46.920 --> 14:48.722
<i>And if I can't generate</i>
<i>an offer on that one,</i>

14:48.755 --> 14:51.224

onto another unit.

<i>* *</i>

14:53.126 --> 14:54.928
So this is the townhouse unit.

It's 5,700 square feet,

14:56.896 --> 14:59.099
four bedrooms,
three full bathrooms,

14:59.132 --> 15:00.467
and two half bathrooms.

15:01.634 --> 15:02.602
- Yeah.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.037
You've got this huge, huge room

15:04.070 --> 15:05.505
with 16-foot ceilings,

15:05.538 --> 15:08.141
crazy moldings,
some beautiful lighting--

15:08.174 --> 15:10.043
this is money.

15:10.043 --> 15:13.079
And then downstairs is where
all the fun stuff is.

<i>I've kind of avoided showing</i>
<i>the townhouse unit that much</i>

15:15.949 --> 15:16.916
<i>because it's not done,</i>

15:16.950 --> 15:18.551
but this unit has features

15:18.585 --> 15:20.053
that none of the others do.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.488
You get a private movie theater.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.489
So this is all soundproof,

15:22.522 --> 15:23.523
so you can come in here--

15:23.556 --> 15:25.225
you can Steven Spielberg

15:25.258 --> 15:28.395
Right now we're in the kitchen.

- This is a kitchen?
- This is the kitchen.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.199
Um...

15:33.233 --> 15:35.235
- Is there a projection
on when it will be finished?

15:35.268 --> 15:38.238
- This will be done in
the next couple months.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.774
- Not yet.
They're making them.

15:40.807 --> 15:43.076
I don't have renderings yet,
because my developers

15:43.076 --> 15:46.212
<i>have been slow in getting me</i>
<i>the renderings.</i>

15:46.246 --> 15:47.580
It's just so frustrating when

15:47.614 --> 15:49.082
there's nothing
I can do about it.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.517
<i>But at the same time,</i>

15:50.550 --> 15:52.686
these are my circumstances,
and I have to deal with it.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.088
And this is your private pool.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.189
Isn't this cool?

15:57.190 --> 16:00.894
- Very cool.
Tough to visualize.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.128
- Really?

16:02.162 --> 16:03.396
It's water.
It's blue, it's wet.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.631
It's--I, like--

16:04.664 --> 16:06.666
just--I know you can do this.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.935
Just picture water.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.437
So there's going
to be water in it.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.605
- Yeah, it's hard for me
to conceptualize.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.442
- Jesus.
[sighs]

16:15.475 --> 16:16.543
- Is that your staging?

16:16.576 --> 16:18.144
- No, the workers
are still in here,

16:18.178 --> 16:19.946
so that's--
that's their table.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.581
So you do have skylights here.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.216
- These look kind of dirty.

16:23.249 --> 16:24.651
- They will be clean
by the time you close.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.586
- And what is the price point?
14?

16:26.619 --> 16:27.687
- 14.
- All right.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.456
I just think it's
a little high.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.690
- If this were in the Village,

16:30.724 --> 16:32.459
we would be 25 million.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.328
- But we're not in the Village.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.629
I think I said a lot of things

16:36.663 --> 16:38.631
that I probably shouldn't have
about Fredrik.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.167
It's not really all his fault.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.736
It's a difficult building.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.739
- It doesn't feel
like a townhouse.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.474
- I could've made no noise--

16:47.507 --> 16:49.743
<i>put it on, not gloated,</i>

16:49.776 --> 16:52.078
<i>not have an ego about it.</i>

16:52.078 --> 16:55.081
And now I am an inch away
from losing it.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.283
And that is complete
failure for me.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.918

17:21.441 --> 17:22.542
- Luis, what's up man?
How you doing?

17:22.575 --> 17:23.543
- Good to see you.

17:23.576 --> 17:24.544
Michael Graves is someone

17:24.577 --> 17:25.812
that works in Douglas Elliman

17:25.845 --> 17:27.047
who I don't know very well,

17:27.080 --> 17:28.214

17:28.248 --> 17:30.517
<i>He has great numbers</i>

17:30.550 --> 17:32.118
He deals with very big clients.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.620
<i>But I have to make sure that</i>

17:33.653 --> 17:36.122
we are compatible personally.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.157
- What's going on?

17:37.190 --> 17:38.558
You got a buyer for something?

17:38.591 --> 17:39.826
- No, listen,
I wanted to see you.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.227
I haven't seen you
in a long time, so--

17:41.261 --> 17:42.929
- I know, I know--
we're, like, in the same office,

17:42.962 --> 17:44.597
but you come by, like--
we're both in there once--

17:44.631 --> 17:46.066
- We were in there every day.
- Well, I'm never there then.

17:46.099 --> 17:49.202
- I didn't tell him what
this meeting was specifically.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.870
<i>I wanted just to see</i>
<i>who he really was</i>

17:50.904 --> 17:52.706
without having him
prepare for it.

17:52.739 --> 17:56.810
Can I please have
a, um, old-fashioned?

17:56.843 --> 17:58.845
- Can I get a gin and tonic,
please?

17:58.878 --> 18:00.080
- Uh, are you a gin drinker?

18:00.113 --> 18:02.782
- I am when it has
to look like water.

18:02.816 --> 18:05.051
[both laughing]

18:05.085 --> 18:06.720
- So, um, so how's--
how's business?

18:06.753 --> 18:08.121
- Business has been
unbelievable.

18:08.154 --> 18:09.322
I was very fortunate.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.890
I was ranked seventh nationwide

18:10.924 --> 18:12.258
by "The Wall Street Journal"
last year.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.326
- Nice.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.627
You've been in business
for how long?

18:14.661 --> 18:16.029
- Uh, five and a half years.

18:16.029 --> 18:17.430
Two months after I had my kids,

18:17.464 --> 18:19.199
I got into real estate
to make a living.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.567
That's how it all happened.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.736
Before, I was not gonna do that.
- What were you gonna do?

18:22.769 --> 18:25.071
- I got a film-scoring degree.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.840
- I wanted to be
a film director.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.274
- Too bad we didn't
connect at that time.

18:28.308 --> 18:31.211
- But we are connected now.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.245
I like this guy.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.780
We seem to understand
each other.

18:33.813 --> 18:37.384
- I've completely built
my business on integrity.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.186
- The guy's very good-looking;
he dresses well.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.321
<i>He has nice hair.</i>

18:41.354 --> 18:42.489
I mean, he's not Puerto Rican,

18:42.522 --> 18:43.890
but you know,
he can't be perfect.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.192
Ha!
[laughing]

18:46.226 --> 18:47.193
How are the kids?

18:47.227 --> 18:48.395
- Oh, my God, amazing.

18:48.428 --> 18:51.197
But it's so difficult
to do all of this

18:51.231 --> 18:52.799
and have a family life.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.068
<i>- Real estate is</i>

18:59.406 --> 19:00.507
<i>Maybe the fact that he has kids</i>

19:00.540 --> 19:03.276

his time to do that.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.045

- Yes.

It's very nice of you
to listen to it,

19:15.789 --> 19:16.856

to wonder, like,

19:16.890 --> 19:18.024
what's going on here?

19:18.024 --> 19:19.259
- I have reached a point
in my career

19:19.292 --> 19:22.028
where I sort of feel that

19:22.062 --> 19:23.496
I could be doing so much better,

19:23.530 --> 19:25.065
but I can't do this on my own.

19:25.098 --> 19:27.567
And you know,
lately I've been percolating

19:27.600 --> 19:31.404
on the idea of,
um, finding a partner.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.106
And the first person
that came to mind--

19:33.139 --> 19:35.842
and I'm--this is
the honest truth,

19:35.875 --> 19:37.610
it's you.

<i>- Now I put my cards</i>
<i>on the table.</i>

20:12.545 --> 20:14.080

20:14.114 --> 20:15.949
<i>anybody in my life,</i>

<i>and he's taking his time</i>
<i>to think about it?</i>

20:18.551 --> 20:20.353

- It's okay.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.788
- Like, you know--
- I understand.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.256
- I'm a perfectionist.

20:23.289 --> 20:26.760
I have a very specific vision
as to how I do this.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.328
- Listen, your business
is doing great.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.796
My business is doing great.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.998
But I think there's gonna be
a point that it's gonna cap.

20:32.032 --> 20:34.067
And I think before it does,

20:34.100 --> 20:36.136
if we can just join forces,

20:36.169 --> 20:37.404
business will triple.

20:41.808 --> 20:45.311

amazing team that,

20:45.345 --> 20:46.813
you know,
supports me,

20:46.846 --> 20:48.481
but you know, I don't have
any of these people

20:48.515 --> 20:50.216
I can point to and say,
"You know what?

20:50.250 --> 20:52.419
"I can't be at this pitch
for a new development;

20:52.452 --> 20:55.121
I can't be at this showing
for a penthouse,"

20:55.155 --> 20:57.857
because my clients
just cannot afford--

20:57.891 --> 20:58.925
- They want you.
- They want me.

20:58.958 --> 20:59.926
- Everybody wants me
all the time.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.961
- Same.

21:02.062 --> 21:04.330
how do I handle all of this

So I think I'm in a similar
place in many ways.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.337

our business twice as big,

one deal together?

the more successful teams--

they have two main frontrunners,

21:25.118 --> 21:26.986
two main guys that,

21:41.968 --> 21:44.404
everything is amazing

21:44.437 --> 21:45.739

the office of Fredrik Eklund.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.143
How are you today?
- Hi.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.345
- Yeah, we need you expertise

23:32.379 --> 23:33.680
at one of our properties.

23:33.713 --> 23:34.781
- I can't have any
sound in there.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.716
- Now, this is
a landmarked building.

23:39.119 --> 23:41.454
- But somehow we have
to make it more quiet.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.123
- I sent you the link
with the photos.

23:43.156 --> 23:44.391
- Can you send me a quote?

23:44.424 --> 23:46.092
- You can send me the quote.
- Excellent.

23:46.126 --> 23:47.327
- Thank you.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.328
[computer beeps]

23:48.361 --> 23:50.997
- Wait, what?
- What is it?

23:51.097 --> 23:53.967
- $410,000.
- What?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.235
- I'm just telling you
what I'm re--

23:55.268 --> 23:56.436
you can see, it's right here.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.972
It says $410,000.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.741
- Oh, it does.
That's a big job.

24:01.775 --> 24:03.309
The windows are very large.

24:03.343 --> 24:05.445
Hmm.
- Well, the biggest one is--

24:05.478 --> 24:06.780
- Let's get Marcella
on the phone.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.349
There's only so many
$7 million buyers

24:09.382 --> 24:11.418
interested in buying
in downtown New York

24:11.451 --> 24:12.619
at one given time.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.554
So let me just explain.
He's obsessed.

24:14.587 --> 24:17.157
He loves, loves, loves
the apartment.

24:17.190 --> 24:20.226
So you can't just
forget about that buyer,

24:20.260 --> 24:21.394
look for someone else...

24:23.463 --> 24:24.631
- No, I agree.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.099
I don't even hear anything
myself in there,

24:26.132 --> 24:27.567
but I do--

24:27.600 --> 24:29.402
you can hear a bus go by.

24:29.436 --> 24:31.104
Like, I mean--

24:31.137 --> 24:34.374
- Okay, sorry.
So we have a quote at $410,000.

24:40.380 --> 24:41.815
I mean, just
the weather-stripping alone

24:41.848 --> 24:44.084
is 21,800.

24:44.084 --> 24:46.152
So you know,
it's not a small job.

24:48.388 --> 24:49.756
- I want you to sell
this apartment.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.092
I know that you want
to buy something else.

24:53.460 --> 24:55.862
- Okay.

24:55.895 --> 24:56.863
- Bye.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.665
Okay, you heard our client.

24:58.698 --> 24:59.733
The client is always right.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.134
Get more quotes.
- Okay.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.089

- No?

- I think--
I think that kills you.

- [inhales] Got to learn

26:00.694 --> 26:03.596

You have no idea.

- You're not that pale.
- Yes, I am.

26:08.101 --> 26:10.337
- Compared to me, you're like
the tannest person in the world.

26:10.370 --> 26:13.106
- Let's go to Greece.
Let's just sit in the sun.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.607
Let's go swim in the salt water

26:14.641 --> 26:16.109
and have octopus all day.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.778
I feel like a different
person when I'm there.

26:18.812 --> 26:20.914
- So--
- Infinitely happier.

26:20.947 --> 26:23.883
- I have an idea.
- What's your idea?

26:23.917 --> 26:26.953
- So why don't we relieve

26:27.053 --> 26:29.589
a little stress?

26:29.622 --> 26:31.825
Why don't we just
get married in Greece?

26:31.858 --> 26:33.860
- Okay, let's not
talk crazy, but--

26:33.893 --> 26:36.596
- I'm not talking crazy.
I think we should do that.

26:39.666 --> 26:42.769
well, I guess,
you're not fat.

26:42.802 --> 26:45.071
- Your parents would fly
all the way to Greece?

26:45.105 --> 26:47.273
You don't want to get married
in Colorado on their ranch?

26:47.307 --> 26:48.608
- No, I don't want
to do it in Colorado.

26:48.641 --> 26:49.676
That's not--
you've never been there.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.077
There's no
emotional connection.

26:51.111 --> 26:52.078
Like,
you grew up in Greece.

26:52.112 --> 26:53.079
We should do it in Greece.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.280
And all my family will come.

26:54.314 --> 26:56.082

27:01.021 --> 27:03.156
If you were from Antarctica,
I would go to Antarctica.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.758
I would probably bitch and moan
a little bit,

Yes.

27:11.664 --> 27:14.434
- Oh, my God.

27:14.467 --> 27:17.570

28:28.174 --> 28:29.209
but it doesn't really work,
you know?

28:29.242 --> 28:30.910
I have, like, 500 matches,

28:30.944 --> 28:33.079

28:36.950 --> 28:39.052

29:24.397 --> 29:25.932
Planned Parenthood.

that Michael brought it up.

to put up all this

29:44.617 --> 29:46.252
greenery around the windows.

29:46.286 --> 29:47.620
- It's a clever idea.

29:47.654 --> 29:49.055
Maybe the guys that protest

29:49.055 --> 29:50.357
have $8 million to spend.

29:50.390 --> 29:52.392
- Of course.

29:52.425 --> 29:53.660
- And the staging, also--

29:53.693 --> 29:55.061
you did a great job.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.463
So tell me, what do you think?

29:56.496 --> 29:58.331
- So his thought is, he needs
a little bit of a cushion.

29:58.365 --> 30:00.500
He bought it for 7.88,

30:00.533 --> 30:05.305
and, um, he's asking for
a listing price of 8.75.

30:05.338 --> 30:07.440
- That's 35.
That's--wow, that's expensive.

30:07.474 --> 30:09.476
It's 3,500 foot.

<i>in such a little</i>

30:18.351 --> 30:20.520

8.75 million--there's so many
options out there

30:23.757 --> 30:25.191
that would probably give you
a little bit more space.

30:25.225 --> 30:26.426
- Right.

30:26.459 --> 30:27.660
- And the fact that
we're on the street level--

30:27.694 --> 30:29.462
- Look, I mean, I don't

30:29.496 --> 30:32.966

a miracle from me.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.902
- I said to him, "Look,
there's a chance we can get it,

30:35.935 --> 30:37.704

30:37.737 --> 30:39.673
<i>- I'm a little bit</i>
<i>concerned that Michael</i>

30:50.450 --> 30:52.819
I just need to make sure
that if we are partnering up,

30:52.852 --> 30:54.621
that he is able to negotiate.

You know what? I think we

I think we need bigger,
sexier pieces of art.

31:02.062 --> 31:03.697

people that bought into

31:03.730 --> 31:04.831
this building are all about.

This is one of the things
that I like the most

31:13.973 --> 31:17.477
about Michael--that he has
a very artistic side to him.

31:17.510 --> 31:19.179
But I'm not going to get
too excited too quickly,

31:19.212 --> 31:21.314
which is what I always do,

31:21.348 --> 31:23.216
because it's
a business decision.

31:23.249 --> 31:24.617
We'll send the invitations out--

31:24.651 --> 31:27.087
- See, that--that's--
I want you for the events, Luis,

31:27.087 --> 31:28.154
'cause you know, I got
to go home at night.

31:28.188 --> 31:29.322
I want to put my kids to bed.

31:29.356 --> 31:30.523
I want to, like, spend some time
with the family.

31:30.557 --> 31:31.691
- No, but listen, you got
to be here in the event,

31:31.725 --> 31:33.760
because the combination
of both of us together

31:33.793 --> 31:35.395
is the real fire.

31:35.428 --> 31:38.765
You need to be here.

31:38.798 --> 31:40.266
- Okay.
- Boom.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.434
- Boom.

31:41.468 --> 31:43.103
- Yes.
- Thank you for coming over.

31:43.136 --> 31:44.437
- Oh, thank you for having me.

31:44.471 --> 31:46.239
- I really appreciate it.
- I'm very happy.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.408
- I can totally see you here
with one of those Tinder girls.

31:48.441 --> 31:51.111
- No. [laughing]
- Some night very soon, Luis.

31:51.144 --> 31:52.846
<i>- No, this is for</i>
<i>wife material.</i>

31:52.879 --> 31:58.251
<i>* *</i>

31:58.284 --> 32:00.353
- I love all the equipment
that you have.

32:00.387 --> 32:01.921
- This is a spectrum analyzer.

32:01.955 --> 32:04.290
- Spectrum man-alazyer?
- Analyzer.

32:04.324 --> 32:06.459
- Oh, analyzer.
So I said man-alyzer, okay.

32:06.493 --> 32:09.396
<i>I realized the last quote I got</i>
<i>for Marcella's windows--</i>

32:09.429 --> 32:11.197
you know, it's like
when you take your car

32:11.231 --> 32:13.299
into the shop for repair work--

32:13.333 --> 32:14.901
it's like they're trying
to upcharge you.

32:14.934 --> 32:16.336
I just need to make
the buyer happy.

32:16.369 --> 32:17.937
He seems very particular
about this.

32:17.971 --> 32:19.639
What can we do?
What does it cost?

32:19.673 --> 32:21.107
What's the solution?

32:21.141 --> 32:23.443
- I'm gonna take readings
with this meter.

32:23.476 --> 32:25.145
It's called transmission loss.

32:25.178 --> 32:26.846
- Mm-hmm.
- It's a logarithmic scale.

32:26.880 --> 32:29.149
- Look for spikes--
- Spikes?

32:29.182 --> 32:32.452
- Then we find
the acoustic leakage points.

32:32.485 --> 32:35.455
- I feel like I'm learning
a whole new language here.

32:35.488 --> 32:38.525
- It is.
My PhD is in signal processing.

32:38.558 --> 32:40.360
- You're a PhD?
- Yeah.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.562
- I have a PhD too:

32:42.595 --> 32:44.564
pretty hot date

32:44.597 --> 32:47.534
with big D.

32:47.567 --> 32:50.370
The only difference is,
it's gonna be pretty noisy.

32:50.403 --> 32:51.504
Let's get to work.

32:51.538 --> 32:53.840
It's beeping.
It's beeping.

32:53.873 --> 32:55.909
52.
- That's pretty standard.

32:55.942 --> 32:57.177
- This is what I said.

32:57.210 --> 32:58.611
It's very standard in New York.
- Yeah, yeah.

32:58.645 --> 32:59.946
- How do you--
wait, can I--

33:00.046 --> 33:01.681
oh, it's beeping.

33:01.715 --> 33:03.183
Beep, beep, beep, beep.
Closer.

33:03.216 --> 33:05.285
36.69 db.

33:05.318 --> 33:06.453
That's high.

33:06.486 --> 33:08.121
- Uh, no, it's pretty quiet.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.556
- Oh, so it's quiet in here?
- Yeah.

33:09.589 --> 33:11.691
You and I are talking at 65.

33:11.725 --> 33:14.627
So 39 is what's called
ambient or background.

33:14.661 --> 33:16.296
- Okay, if I can fix this,

33:16.329 --> 33:17.664
the buyer will buy
the apartment.

33:17.697 --> 33:20.867
- You can actually have
custom windows made

33:20.900 --> 33:22.235
to look just like this.

33:22.268 --> 33:23.503
- Expensive, expensive.

33:23.536 --> 33:25.772
- The other things--
oh, very expensive.

33:25.805 --> 33:27.474
- Okay, maybe not
that alternative.

33:27.507 --> 33:28.608
- Okay.
- What's the other alternative?

33:28.641 --> 33:30.810
- So air is an absorber.

33:30.844 --> 33:33.480
So you do seals, and then
you do another piece of glass,

33:33.513 --> 33:37.417
and that glass create
the insulation.

33:37.450 --> 33:40.387
- Just give it to me straight--
how much is it gonna be?

33:40.420 --> 33:44.691
- I would estimate it's
gonna be about $56,000.

33:46.092 --> 33:49.462
- Okay, $56,000 it is.

33:49.496 --> 33:50.964
$56,000?

33:50.997 --> 33:52.665
<i>I mean, I can get Marcella</i>
<i>to accept this,</i>

33:52.699 --> 33:55.669
even if I have to yell at her
at 65 db's.

33:55.702 --> 33:57.504
How's that for audio leakage?

33:57.537 --> 33:59.506
Sold, 6%.

33:59.539 --> 34:02.475
Sold, record-breaker.
- Oh, my God, it's at 100.

<i>- What was it called,</i>
<i>man-ariser?</i>

34:03.910 --> 34:05.578
<i>- [laughing]</i>

34:07.213 --> 34:08.682
- So if you throw in
your commission,

34:08.715 --> 34:09.916
what does it bring the offer to?

34:09.949 --> 34:10.917
- I'm not going to.

- How you doing?

34:31.971 --> 34:34.507

Thanks for meeting.

34:34.541 --> 34:35.709
You're drinking a Bloody Mary?

34:35.742 --> 34:38.211
- Yeah, it's only 12:00.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.513
- Got you.
How is everything, good?

34:40.547 --> 34:42.749
- Not so good.
- Not so good?

34:42.782 --> 34:43.917
Why?

34:46.453 --> 34:48.088
- No, no I'm not.
- Okay.

34:48.121 --> 34:49.889
- No, I'm gonna give you
a good one.

34:49.923 --> 34:52.459
The people for the penthouse...
- Hmm.

34:52.492 --> 34:53.827
- I didn't lose them
when I presented

34:53.860 --> 34:55.328
the offer to you last time.
- Mm-hmm.

34:55.362 --> 34:57.330
- I basically just have been
trying to pull

34:57.364 --> 35:01.034
every little thing
out of them that I could.

35:01.067 --> 35:03.203
They've come up from 7.5,

35:03.236 --> 35:05.038
and they'll come up to 7.85.

35:05.071 --> 35:07.640
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

35:07.674 --> 35:11.111
That's right,
my persistence paid off.

35:11.144 --> 35:12.679
And by persistence,

35:12.712 --> 35:15.749
I mean my constant,
brutal harassment

35:15.782 --> 35:17.617
<i>of people who are actually</i>
<i>really, really nice.</i>

35:17.650 --> 35:18.918
- See, this is what
I was sensing.

35:18.952 --> 35:21.654
- What?
- Giving me a bad offer.

35:21.688 --> 35:23.590
- We need to seriously
consider their offer,

35:23.623 --> 35:26.493
because if I lose them,
I don't have anybody else.

35:26.526 --> 35:29.329
The problem is, is that we have
other competition on the market

35:29.362 --> 35:30.630
that is priced
right where we are.

35:30.663 --> 35:32.399
- We're undercompensating.

35:32.432 --> 35:33.933
- Not compared
to 93 Worth Street.

35:33.967 --> 35:35.602
Not compared
to 87 Leonard Street.

35:35.635 --> 35:37.470
Those are full-service
buildings.

35:37.504 --> 35:40.507
93 Worth Street has,
like, a doggie spa,

35:40.540 --> 35:41.808
and a gym and a playroom,

35:41.841 --> 35:43.143
full service doorman.

35:43.176 --> 35:44.944
And we're getting
the same number

35:44.978 --> 35:46.179
for a four-unit building

35:46.212 --> 35:47.747
with really no amenities.

35:47.781 --> 35:48.948
- Maybe you should
throw another party.

35:48.982 --> 35:50.684
- I--no, I'm not gonna
throw another party.

35:50.717 --> 35:51.951
It's a waste of time.

35:51.985 --> 35:53.820
Everybody knows about
this apartment.

35:53.853 --> 35:55.422
Since taking over Walker Street,

35:55.455 --> 35:57.157
I have brought
almost 1,000 people

35:57.190 --> 35:58.525
through the door.

35:58.558 --> 36:00.060
And I know this isn't
the number that you want,

36:00.093 --> 36:01.661
but sometimes we don't
always get what we want.

36:01.695 --> 36:03.196
Right?

36:03.229 --> 36:04.597
It's hard for a lot
of developers to understand,

36:04.631 --> 36:07.033
because it's New York!
It's real estate!

36:07.033 --> 36:09.135
I'm supposed to make millions!
That's how this happens.

36:09.169 --> 36:12.205
But it doesn't always happen.
It's hard.

36:12.238 --> 36:14.174
It's really hard.

36:14.207 --> 36:16.309
We should take
the penthouse deal.

36:16.343 --> 36:18.511
It shows everybody
that the building is selling.

36:18.545 --> 36:20.914
- It's selling
at stupid-low prices.

36:20.947 --> 36:23.550
So if you throw in
your commission,

36:23.583 --> 36:26.619
what does it bring the offer to?

36:26.653 --> 36:28.822
- I'm not going to.

36:28.855 --> 36:30.390
- Let's just say for kicks.

36:30.423 --> 36:31.858
- No, I'm not gonna
say that for kicks.

36:31.891 --> 36:33.326
- Let's just say for kicks.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.228
- Let's not say it for kicks.

36:35.261 --> 36:37.163
I worked my ass off for this.

36:37.197 --> 36:40.066
I don't work for free.

36:40.100 --> 36:41.801
I think we should
take the penthouse deal.

36:41.835 --> 36:44.437
We've got two of the four
units then in contract.

36:44.471 --> 36:46.706
And then we can take our time,
buy time,

36:46.740 --> 36:48.608
and get the pricing that we want

36:48.641 --> 36:51.111
on the townhouse,
once you finish it,

36:51.144 --> 36:53.146
and on the fourth floor.

36:53.179 --> 36:54.814
Because the townhouse
is a beautiful apartment.

36:54.848 --> 36:56.883
It's insane,
but it needs to be finished.

36:56.916 --> 36:58.218
No one understands it.

36:58.251 --> 37:00.053
I mean, people are so--
I've showed people the pool.

37:00.086 --> 37:01.321
There's no water in it.

37:01.354 --> 37:02.822
They don't understand
that it's a pool.

37:02.856 --> 37:05.625
- Just 'cause there's no water
in it, they can't imagine--

37:05.658 --> 37:07.360
- Welcome to my life.
- Really?

37:07.394 --> 37:10.397
- Yeah, welcome to my life.
That's what I have to deal with.

37:10.430 --> 37:13.333
He needs to understand
he has a tough building,

37:13.366 --> 37:15.301
and we cannot lose momentum.

37:15.335 --> 37:17.037
'Cause anyone saw
the building at all,

37:17.037 --> 37:18.304
and then what happens?

37:18.338 --> 37:20.206
People are just gonna
immediately write it off.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.208
Brokers first,
and then buyers.

37:22.242 --> 37:25.345
That's the gravity
of the situation.

37:25.378 --> 37:27.647
Take the penthouse, 'cause
that's 50% of the building.

37:27.681 --> 37:29.716
And then we'll make it back
on the other two.

37:29.749 --> 37:33.219

but they're not disastrous.

37:44.230 --> 37:47.701
You'll make it up
on the other two units

37:47.734 --> 37:50.503
when we finish construction
on the townhouse.

37:50.537 --> 37:53.073
- Great. So we have a deal
on the penthouse?

37:53.073 --> 37:55.375

take the penthouse.

38:19.866 --> 38:21.267
I'm gonna think really
hard about it.

38:21.301 --> 38:23.737

forget about that thought.

39:26.499 --> 39:28.902
you know, I'm rolling the money
from this into that property.

39:28.935 --> 39:30.470

39:30.503 --> 39:32.038
- Yeah, well, this
is a huge problem.

39:32.072 --> 39:34.908
I have to buy and sell
at exactly the same time.

39:34.941 --> 39:36.242
- You have to sell.
I have the buyer.

39:36.276 --> 39:37.911
I mean, the whole thing--
we got the full ask

39:37.944 --> 39:40.113

It's not the way I work.

this whole issue

You can't bring this up to me.

he said he's so excited.

40:50.717 --> 40:52.318
We have some things

Your development

40:55.121 --> 40:56.723
I like.

40:57.724 --> 40:59.225
I like it.

40:59.259 --> 41:01.194
- What?
- Yes.

41:01.227 --> 41:03.863
- Oh.
I mean, I'm still upset

41:03.897 --> 41:06.299
at the 7 million,
but this, I mean--

41:06.332 --> 41:08.401
it does change things
around a little bit.

41:08.435 --> 41:10.437
<i>1 Great Jones Alley</i>

<i>I've already sold</i>

41:13.673 --> 41:16.509
but I still have a little bit
of ways to go,

41:16.543 --> 41:20.080
so the fact that Marcella's
interested is very exciting.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.281
- I walk by it every day.

41:21.314 --> 41:22.482
I love the neighborhood.

41:22.515 --> 41:24.284
You know NoHo's
on fire right now.

41:24.317 --> 41:26.319
- I'm so happy you like
1 Great Jones Alley,

41:26.353 --> 41:28.822
but, Marcella,
it's not a renovation project.

41:28.855 --> 41:30.390
It comes fully finished--
gorgeous.

41:30.423 --> 41:31.891
- I don't usually look
at new development,

41:31.925 --> 41:34.794
but considering
the neighborhood--

41:34.828 --> 41:36.396
- It's literally one
half-block away from you.

41:36.429 --> 41:37.597
- I know, I know.
It's good.

41:37.630 --> 41:39.265
And it looks amazing.

41:39.299 --> 41:41.468
- Wait, wait, wait--
it's 16 months away.

- That's the issue here.

so you sell Bleecker,

41:46.473 --> 41:47.540

- I move into
1 Great Jones Alley.

41:49.576 --> 41:50.777
- Makes sense.

41:50.810 --> 41:53.813
A door closes,
and something else opens.

41:53.847 --> 41:56.716
I love when my properties
and my buyers

Mm-hmm.

42:04.758 --> 42:06.059
It is an amazing investment.

42:06.059 --> 42:08.161
By putting 10% away
in an escrow account

42:08.194 --> 42:09.262

42:09.295 --> 42:10.530
you're gonna make
a lot of money.

- That's--that's what
I really want to hear.

42:11.865 --> 42:13.099
That's music to my ears.
