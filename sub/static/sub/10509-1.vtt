WEBVTT

01:55.061 --> 02:02.262
"A story has begun spinning again.."

02:02.741 --> 02:09.822
"The color of dawn can be seen in the eyes."

02:10.301 --> 02:13.622
"Distances seem much closer."

02:14.102 --> 02:17.502
"Love is only for the lucky few."

02:17.982 --> 02:24.143
"There's a new color in the air."

02:24.623 --> 02:32.023
"The crazy heart's set out again."

02:32.502 --> 02:39.663
"In search of trouble."

02:40.142 --> 02:47.223
"To immerse in the clutches of feelings."

02:47.703 --> 02:54.824
"There it goes.. There it goes."

02:55.304 --> 02:58.664
"There it goes again.."

03:11.545 --> 03:13.465
Mama, I want to defeat Aditi.

03:13.945 --> 03:14.945
And I want to win this race.

03:15.424 --> 03:16.825
Only then can I sit with Nirvan.

03:17.305 --> 03:18.506
Nirvan? Who's that?

03:18.985 --> 03:19.905
He's really cute.

03:20.386 --> 03:21.785
But he sits with Aditi.

03:22.264 --> 03:25.466
No wonder you're so eager to defeat Aditi.

03:25.945 --> 03:29.345
You know, Riya saw Aditi and her mom practicing.

03:29.825 --> 03:31.426
And they run really fast.

03:31.906 --> 03:34.106
No problem, you're a fast runner too.

03:34.586 --> 03:37.746
And by the way, I was on my school's track team as well.

03:38.225 --> 03:40.707
Yeah.. - Excuse me, mom, this is a race.

03:41.186 --> 03:43.026
Not some case, which you always win.

03:43.506 --> 03:45.387
Excuse me, young lady, better watch it.

03:45.866 --> 03:49.347
Okay. - Watch it.

03:49.826 --> 03:51.147
Bye.

03:51.627 --> 03:54.546
Ms. Sanaya Verma, are you forgetting something?

03:55.027 --> 03:58.386
Oh yes..

04:00.027 --> 04:03.067
Love you. - Love you too. See you later, okay.

04:03.547 --> 04:06.907
Goodbye. - Bye. See you later.

04:12.388 --> 04:13.147
Yes, Mr. Parmar.

04:13.627 --> 04:16.748
Madam, today's the final hearing on Abbas' case at 11 o'clock.

04:17.226 --> 04:20.588
Thanks. I will be there.

04:25.228 --> 04:28.589
Good morning. - Good morning.

04:32.029 --> 04:35.389
Ready? - Always.

04:38.588 --> 04:42.428
I wish..those high-heels could help you win the case.

04:42.909 --> 04:45.510
Were you playing some game today? - No.

04:45.989 --> 04:48.469
It looks like you lost.

04:48.949 --> 04:52.310
All rise.

04:56.509 --> 04:59.709
Your honor, my client is a well known history-sheeter.

05:00.189 --> 05:02.190
Extortion..Kidnapping..Assault!

05:02.671 --> 05:04.110
He's been accused for every type of crime..

05:04.591 --> 05:06.030
..and he's also spent time in jail for it.

05:06.511 --> 05:08.590
That was his past.

05:09.070 --> 05:12.190
But today..he is paying a price for his past.

05:12.670 --> 05:16.830
Your honor, this is clearly an open and shut case of extortion.

05:17.311 --> 05:18.231
It would be, Mr. Public Prosecutor..

05:18.710 --> 05:21.391
..if only you had firm evidence to prove it.

05:21.871 --> 05:23.951
That so called 'Dictaphone' you mention repeatedly..

05:24.430 --> 05:24.550
..where is it?

05:25.031 --> 05:27.831
It's been cleverly stolen from the Police Station.

05:28.311 --> 05:29.831
Watch where you're going with that, Mr. Public Prosecutor!

05:30.311 --> 05:31.751
The Police are on your side, not mine.

05:32.231 --> 05:34.871
And that's why we have the Police's written statement.

05:35.351 --> 05:37.791
And unfortunately..this cannot be accepted, your honor.

05:38.272 --> 05:39.952
They have no evidence, your honor.

05:40.432 --> 05:41.432
This is pure harassment.

05:41.912 --> 05:43.832
This case must be dismissed.

05:44.312 --> 05:48.072
Defendant Abbas Abdul Razaq..

05:48.552 --> 05:52.632
Not guilty.

05:53.112 --> 05:53.192
Congratulations.

05:53.673 --> 05:54.992
We've permission, I'll complete his file.

05:55.473 --> 05:57.552
Advocate Verma..congratulations.

05:58.033 --> 05:58.593
We won.

05:59.073 --> 06:00.513
Not we, you..

06:00.993 --> 06:03.113
You won, Abbas. Congratulations.

06:03.592 --> 06:05.512
Abbas may have many traits..

06:05.993 --> 06:07.473
..but he always repays a favor.

06:07.953 --> 06:09.233
Don't hesitate to call..if you ever need me.

06:09.713 --> 06:11.753
I'll be there. - Never.

06:12.233 --> 06:13.314
If you believe in prayers..

06:13.793 --> 06:15.913
..then pray that we never meet again.

06:16.393 --> 06:18.473
Never?

06:18.953 --> 06:21.274
Life is very strange, Mrs. Verma.

06:21.754 --> 06:26.233
What hasn't happened yet..happens sometime.

06:26.714 --> 06:27.634
Here. - What is this?

06:28.114 --> 06:31.475
Gift for you.

06:34.114 --> 06:36.275
You could've been jailed for five years because of this.

06:36.755 --> 06:37.595
How did you get your hands on this?

06:38.074 --> 06:39.914
Everything has a price, Abbas.

06:40.394 --> 06:43.754
You just need to know who..and how?

06:52.394 --> 06:57.115
Inspector Yohaan, your Big B look and attitude won't work here.

06:57.595 --> 07:00.595
Do you expect me to trot around like Singham?

07:01.075 --> 07:02.556
There are serious charges of corruption against you.

07:03.036 --> 07:05.515
Do I need to tell you what corruption is?

07:05.996 --> 07:07.916
Money attracts money.

07:08.396 --> 07:11.916
Money begets more money.

07:12.396 --> 07:13.996
And so today it's yours, tomorrow it's his..

07:14.476 --> 07:15.637
..and God knows whose.. the day after.

07:16.116 --> 07:17.636
Who can understand the character of money..

07:18.116 --> 07:19.076
..better than you, Rokre sir.

07:19.556 --> 07:21.076
Your guy spilled everything.

07:21.556 --> 07:23.636
You are in big trouble now.

07:24.117 --> 07:26.836
Small troubles not my cup of tea anyway, Rokre sir.

07:27.316 --> 07:28.756
And as far as that Udipi manager is concerned..

07:29.236 --> 07:30.957
..then let me ask you a simple question.

07:31.437 --> 07:32.917
How many times have I been decorated..

07:33.397 --> 07:35.837
..and bestowed with Police medals?

07:36.316 --> 07:38.477
3-4 times..but that doesn't make a difference.

07:38.957 --> 07:41.438
It does, Rokre sir.

07:41.917 --> 07:43.598
You choose to believe a lowly restaurant manager..

07:44.077 --> 07:46.397
..instead of a decorated officer.

07:46.877 --> 07:48.118
Even his lentil reeks of Kerosene.

07:48.597 --> 07:49.918
He has admitted..

07:50.398 --> 07:54.437
..to collecting bribe money on your behalf.

07:54.918 --> 07:59.798
And if I say that I collect bribe money on behalf of the Commissioner?

08:00.278 --> 08:01.719
What will you do? Arrest him?

08:02.198 --> 08:04.518
Save your cheap arguments for the court.

08:04.998 --> 08:08.358
You're suspended. With immediate effect.

08:17.599 --> 08:19.239
You sc**** a really nice career.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.239
It's all your fault.

08:21.719 --> 08:22.440
You're gone for good, Yohaan.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.520
This time we've a strong case against you.

08:24.999 --> 08:26.759
I know..you will never play a losing game.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.040
There will be a warrant issued against you in two days.

08:29.519 --> 08:33.280
There is one way..to save you.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.039
Go on, I am listening.

08:35.519 --> 08:37.039
The others wouldn't budge under five..

08:37.519 --> 08:39.159
..but I convinced them that Yohaan's one of us.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.039
If we don't support him, who else will?

08:41.520 --> 08:42.600
Stop twisting your words..name your price.

08:43.080 --> 08:46.080
1.5 crores..only for you.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.121
1.5 crores..? - Yes.

08:48.600 --> 08:55.081
I'm fishing for alms myself, how will I arrange a feast for you?

08:55.560 --> 08:58.801
Just like you know to take..you should learn to give.

08:59.281 --> 09:00.681
You don't have a monopoly on taking bribes.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.521
Alone.

09:11.361 --> 09:13.561
1.5 crores.

09:14.042 --> 09:16.722
Everyone has the same agenda here.

09:17.202 --> 09:21.722
They all salute Bapu on the 1000 rupees note.

09:22.202 --> 09:26.241
This time you're gone for good, Yohaan.

09:26.722 --> 09:30.082
Jai Hind!

09:32.443 --> 09:34.203
Mr. Parmar, how have your nights been?

09:34.682 --> 09:35.563
Did you get the original Shilajeet.

09:36.043 --> 09:36.763
Tell me, I'll get it for you.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.123
Look, Mr. Yohaan, you've been told before.. - Madam is busy.

09:39.602 --> 09:40.243
Yes. - But I am free.

09:40.724 --> 09:42.403
Mr. Yohaan, you're crossing your limit.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.843
No I am not, I am coming in.

09:45.322 --> 09:46.724
Mr. Parmar, it's okay.

09:47.203 --> 09:47.643
We're almost done here.

09:48.483 --> 09:48.803
Excuse us. - Yes, ma'am.

09:49.283 --> 09:49.444
Thank you. - Yes, ma'am.

09:49.923 --> 09:50.483
Shall I tell her about the Shilajeet?

09:50.963 --> 09:53.083
Please.. - Go out!

09:53.564 --> 09:56.084
Bye.

09:56.564 --> 09:58.124
How is Sanaya? - She's fine.

09:58.604 --> 10:00.164
She misses you.

10:00.644 --> 10:02.404
We've known each other since school days.

10:02.884 --> 10:03.524
Right?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.483
You used to be the class monitor..

10:05.964 --> 10:06.844
..and we were the bloody backbenchers.

10:07.324 --> 10:08.604
And you would still get into trouble..

10:09.084 --> 10:12.285
We would fight, but we were friends. - We still are.

10:12.765 --> 10:13.844
So..what is it?

10:14.325 --> 10:17.085
Anu, this time I'm done for good.

10:17.565 --> 10:18.645
The Anti-corruption people have tightened their grip on me..

10:19.125 --> 10:21.005
..and I'll definitely be suspended.

10:21.484 --> 10:23.805
Can you imagine.. inspector Yohaan, off-duty?

10:24.285 --> 10:25.284
It's a good thing if you're off-duty.

10:25.765 --> 10:26.484
People will feel safe.

10:26.965 --> 10:27.805
Not the people, only criminals.

10:28.284 --> 10:29.686
If I take a single day off, they celebrate like it's Eid.

10:30.165 --> 10:31.164
Last time I was down with Dengue..

10:31.645 --> 10:32.005
..and they were celebrating like it was Diwali.

10:32.485 --> 10:33.805
Even though I'm your best friend..

10:34.285 --> 10:35.845
..it's hard to say whether you're honest or corrupt.

10:36.325 --> 10:39.166
I am not corrupt. Rokre's asking me to bribe him 1.5 crores.

10:39.646 --> 10:40.726
If you review corruption in Police..

10:41.206 --> 10:41.966
..I am still way below the poverty line.

10:42.445 --> 10:44.086
1.5 crores. - So you're not corrupt.

10:44.566 --> 10:46.846
The whole bloody system is corrupt. - Yeah.

10:47.326 --> 10:48.767
100 rupees bribe is offering.

10:49.246 --> 10:50.286
And 10 million is considered bribe.

10:50.766 --> 10:52.526
That's how it is.

10:53.006 --> 10:54.247
I went against my father to become a police officer.

10:54.726 --> 10:54.966
Now if they fire me..

10:55.447 --> 10:56.447
..he'll make me cook bread on the hot stove.

10:56.926 --> 10:57.006
Will you like that?

10:57.486 --> 10:58.886
Maybe that'll be good for your health.

10:59.366 --> 11:02.726
You can take up cases of scoundrels like Abbas Razaq, but not me.

11:03.206 --> 11:03.887
And what kind of firm are you running here..

11:04.367 --> 11:05.327
..that takes up cases of those who are guilty.

11:05.807 --> 11:08.526
The innocent cannot afford my fees.

11:09.007 --> 11:09.847
Okay, I'll afford your fees.

11:10.327 --> 11:10.767
What's your fee?

11:11.246 --> 11:13.127
I know you won't charge me anything because we're friends..

11:13.608 --> 11:14.487
..but I will..I will pay. - Shut up.

11:14.967 --> 11:16.328
Shut up, okay..I'll think about it.

11:16.807 --> 11:19.488
You'll think about it? - Yeah.

11:19.967 --> 11:20.807
Where are you going now? The gym?

11:21.288 --> 11:22.208
Sports Day in Sanaya's school.

11:22.687 --> 11:23.888
I am taking part in the race along with her.

11:24.368 --> 11:29.408
Remember..even back in school, I ran faster than you.

11:29.888 --> 11:33.248
That's why I could never catch you.

11:39.808 --> 11:43.168
All ready.

11:45.328 --> 11:47.009
Look at the competition.

11:47.488 --> 11:51.409
Don't worry..mama's here.

11:51.889 --> 11:54.049
And we're the best. We're going to do our best.

11:54.530 --> 11:54.929
Yes. - Yes.

11:55.409 --> 11:58.769
Yes. - Okay, let's go.

12:08.010 --> 12:09.850
Come on, come on.

12:10.330 --> 12:14.249
Come on, Sanaya..come on.

12:14.730 --> 12:16.370
Come on.

12:16.850 --> 12:20.850
Mom.

12:21.330 --> 12:23.010
Hurry.

12:23.490 --> 12:27.810
Mom.

12:28.290 --> 12:31.650
Mom, run faster.

12:32.131 --> 12:33.811
Fast.

12:34.290 --> 12:37.651
Run, come on, mom!

13:00.932 --> 13:02.251
Where's Sanaya?

13:02.732 --> 13:06.413
Where's Sanaya?

13:06.892 --> 13:10.852
Sanaya.

13:11.333 --> 13:14.652
Sanaya.

13:15.133 --> 13:17.213
Sanaya.

13:17.694 --> 13:18.933
Sanaya.

13:19.412 --> 13:20.133
Did you see Sanaya?

13:20.613 --> 13:21.212
Sanaya.

13:21.693 --> 13:25.614
Did you see Sanaya? Sanaya.

13:26.093 --> 13:29.414
Sanaya.

13:29.893 --> 13:33.254
Sanaya.

13:35.894 --> 13:39.254
Sanaya. Where are you?

13:41.454 --> 13:44.814
Sanaya.

13:51.334 --> 13:54.694
Sanaya!

14:38.697 --> 14:42.056
Hello.

14:48.656 --> 14:49.456
Please don't do this.

14:49.935 --> 14:50.655
Let my daughter go.

14:51.135 --> 14:52.615
Mrs. Verma, you're educated..

14:53.095 --> 14:54.255
..and one of the top lawyer's of this city..

14:54.734 --> 14:58.214
..and yet you failed to understand.

14:58.694 --> 14:59.774
Stay close, don't let her go.

15:00.254 --> 15:04.374
Can't you follow a simple instruction to save your daughter's life?

15:04.853 --> 15:05.492
Where do I have to go?

15:05.973 --> 15:09.332
Just drive.

15:14.172 --> 15:15.611
This is between you and me.

15:16.092 --> 15:17.292
These cops have nothing to do with it.

15:17.771 --> 15:20.131
Get rid of them.

15:20.610 --> 15:23.291
What's she doing?

15:23.770 --> 15:25.810
She wants to get rid of us.

15:26.290 --> 15:27.730
And the wireless mike?

15:28.210 --> 15:30.010
Take it off and throw it out.

15:30.489 --> 15:33.849
Now.

15:36.169 --> 15:36.728
She took off the mike.

15:37.209 --> 15:37.449
Done.

15:37.928 --> 15:39.649
She's receiving instructions from the kidnapper on her cell phone.

15:40.128 --> 15:42.248
Very good..we'll get along just fine.

15:42.728 --> 15:46.087
Now get rid of these cops. Quickly.

15:54.446 --> 15:57.805
Stop!

16:09.004 --> 16:10.964
Madam..stop the car.

16:11.444 --> 16:14.803
Radio those fools and tell them to stop following her.

16:29.961 --> 16:32.561
Stay there.

16:33.041 --> 16:34.560
Move. Move back.

16:35.041 --> 16:36.840
Where are you?

16:37.321 --> 16:39.040
Where is Sanaya?

16:39.520 --> 16:42.879
Where is Sanaya?

16:53.278 --> 16:55.677
Solanki, look at this. - Yeah.

16:56.158 --> 16:57.437
Mama, breakfast.

16:57.917 --> 17:00.196
Finish your breakfast, dear, or you'll be late for school.

17:00.677 --> 17:02.157
Mama, today is Saturday.

17:02.636 --> 17:05.756
And you promised to take me out.

17:06.236 --> 17:07.155
Please, mom..let's go shopping.

17:07.636 --> 17:09.516
Or the Mall..or the garden..

17:09.996 --> 17:11.156
Please, mom, let's go.

17:11.635 --> 17:12.835
No, mom, let's go to Essel World.

17:13.315 --> 17:14.395
Everyone in my class has been there, mom..

17:14.875 --> 17:15.355
..except me and Nitya.

17:15.835 --> 17:16.954
And Nitya's going today.

17:17.435 --> 17:18.714
That leaves only me.

17:19.194 --> 17:20.834
Mom, please let's go. You promised..

17:21.313 --> 17:22.874
Sorry, I have to go to the office today. - Please.

17:23.353 --> 17:23.713
Important case.

17:24.193 --> 17:25.034
Please..please..please..

17:25.512 --> 17:25.953
We'll go next week, promise.

17:26.434 --> 17:27.753
Pinky promise? - Pinky promise.

17:28.233 --> 17:29.913
Okay.

17:30.393 --> 17:33.952
Bye. - Bye.

17:34.433 --> 17:37.792
My daughter.

17:59.389 --> 18:01.508
Hello. - Hello, Mrs. Verma.

18:01.988 --> 18:03.749
I will give you one more chance.

18:04.228 --> 18:09.148
Last chance. For good behavior.

18:09.628 --> 18:09.787
Thank you.

18:10.267 --> 18:16.707
I can see you..so please don't act smart.

18:17.186 --> 18:20.546
Open your laptop.

18:25.225 --> 18:26.585
This is your last chance.

18:27.065 --> 18:27.625
Last chance.

18:28.105 --> 18:28.705
Sanaya.

18:29.185 --> 18:31.864
Tell those cops that Sanaya is with her grandma.

18:32.344 --> 18:33.384
And get out of there.

18:33.864 --> 18:37.224
Right now.

18:39.863 --> 18:41.383
What's wrong? All okay.

18:41.863 --> 18:44.023
Mom just called. Sanaya's with her.

18:44.502 --> 18:45.902
Someone just dropped her off.

18:46.382 --> 18:49.261
I must go there.

18:49.741 --> 18:50.741
Everything is okay.

18:51.222 --> 18:52.302
You can all leave.

18:52.781 --> 18:56.141
Thank you very much.

18:58.140 --> 18:59.181
I've the money with me.

18:59.661 --> 19:00.860
Don't worry about the money.

19:01.340 --> 19:01.860
I don't understand.

19:02.339 --> 19:04.860
Mrs. Verma, what's your opinion about death sentence?

19:05.339 --> 19:07.019
How is this linked with Sanaya?

19:07.499 --> 19:10.019
A man's been sentenced to death by the court.

19:10.498 --> 19:11.099
He's innocent.

19:11.578 --> 19:12.578
He's been framed.

19:13.059 --> 19:14.259
He has appealed in the High Court.

19:14.738 --> 19:17.178
I want you to defend his case and save him.

19:17.659 --> 19:19.978
I want him to walk free, Mrs. Verma.

19:20.457 --> 19:22.136
The appeal date is next Wednesday..

19:22.617 --> 19:23.737
..so you have only four days.

19:24.217 --> 19:27.416
You have only four days. - What?

19:27.896 --> 19:29.257
If you can't get him acquitted..

19:29.736 --> 19:31.535
..you will never see your daughter again.

19:32.016 --> 19:33.655
Wait a minute.

19:34.135 --> 19:35.775
I want proof..

19:36.256 --> 19:38.375
Is my daughter safe and sound, or not?

19:38.855 --> 19:42.215
Fine, give me five minutes.

20:10.810 --> 20:11.450
Hello, Mr. Parmar. - Yes.

20:11.930 --> 20:13.090
It's an emergency.

20:13.571 --> 20:17.130
A new case.

20:17.609 --> 20:19.089
23 year old Art student, Siya..

20:19.570 --> 20:20.569
..was found missing from her home.

20:21.049 --> 20:23.089
A milkman noticed blood oozing from under the door..

20:23.568 --> 20:24.648
..and called the Police.

20:25.128 --> 20:26.768
15 days later, Siya's dead body..

20:27.248 --> 20:30.048
..was found in a puddle under the Vashi bridge.

20:30.527 --> 20:32.648
This means the killer murdered Siya at her home..

20:33.127 --> 20:35.326
..and dumped her body under the Vashi Bridge.

20:35.807 --> 20:38.446
What's surprising is that the murderer was apprehended immediately.

20:38.926 --> 20:40.726
Exactly two days after the body was found.

20:41.205 --> 20:41.846
Let's go.. stop pretending.

20:42.326 --> 20:43.806
According to these reports, Niyaz..

20:44.286 --> 20:46.805
..has been convicted five times for rape and violence.

20:47.286 --> 20:49.045
Come on..let's go..

20:49.525 --> 20:51.605
The fingerprints and foot prints found at the crime scene..

20:52.085 --> 20:53.844
..belonged to him.

20:54.325 --> 20:56.164
Siya's wallet, which was recovered from Niyaz's room..

20:56.645 --> 21:01.483
..had Siya's blood stains and Niyaz' fingerprints.

21:01.963 --> 21:03.323
On the basis of all the evidence against him..

21:03.803 --> 21:05.123
..he has been sentenced to death.

21:05.602 --> 21:06.963
And he has appealed against this in the High Court.

21:07.443 --> 21:08.523
His hearing is three days from now.

21:09.002 --> 21:09.682
We've very little time..

21:10.162 --> 21:11.682
..and I want the victim's complete history. - Yes.

21:12.161 --> 21:14.402
Who performed the autopsy? - Dr. Satish.

21:14.881 --> 21:16.761
And the officer in charge? - Inspector Yohaan.

21:17.241 --> 21:18.521
Yeah..I apprehended him.

21:19.001 --> 21:20.480
That case has been solved. - But ma'am just took up that case.

21:20.961 --> 21:22.600
What? - Yes.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.880
Anu is taking Niyaz's case. - Yes.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.920
Curses.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.799
Listen..Parmar. - Yes.

21:30.279 --> 21:32.719
I'll get you the best Shilajeet on the market. - Not again..

21:33.199 --> 21:35.039
Convince Anu to take up my case.

21:35.519 --> 21:37.718
Your old age and my career will both be secured.

21:38.198 --> 21:38.598
Hold on.

21:39.078 --> 21:42.437
Inspector Yohaan.

21:44.757 --> 21:46.597
Inspector Yohaan.

21:47.077 --> 21:47.436
Inspector Yohaan.

21:47.917 --> 21:51.276
Yohaan, stop.

21:55.595 --> 21:57.196
Inspector Yohaan.

21:57.675 --> 21:59.195
Ashamed of calling me brother-in-law.

21:59.675 --> 22:00.835
You can at least call me sir..I was your senior.

22:01.315 --> 22:02.554
I've an arrest warrant for you.

22:03.035 --> 22:04.754
I know..you wouldn't come here with your sister's proposal.

22:05.235 --> 22:07.754
Yohaan..we've orders to arrest you.

22:08.234 --> 22:12.433
Fools..if you arrest me, how will I arrange for 1.5 crore.

22:12.913 --> 22:16.273
Don't you want your share?

22:19.673 --> 22:19.992
Hello, Anu.

22:20.472 --> 22:23.712
The Anti-corruption people are after me.

22:24.192 --> 22:25.072
They've issued a warrant against me.

22:25.552 --> 22:25.912
Where are you?

22:26.392 --> 22:27.352
I am busy with Niyaz' case.

22:27.831 --> 22:29.352
Anu, please don't make that mistake.

22:29.831 --> 22:30.751
He's a murderer and a rapist.

22:31.230 --> 22:32.710
All the evidence is against him. He'll be sentenced to death.

22:33.191 --> 22:34.311
Just tell me what you know.

22:34.790 --> 22:36.990
Her mother is a professor, father was in advertising.

22:37.470 --> 22:38.830
They both separated. Later her father died.

22:39.310 --> 22:40.390
Siya was their only child.

22:40.869 --> 22:42.590
And as far as I know, they don't have any relatives.

22:43.069 --> 22:45.428
Listen..are you seriously taking his case?

22:45.909 --> 22:46.909
I know what I am doing?

22:47.389 --> 22:49.149
Fine..then tell me what I should do.

22:49.628 --> 22:50.828
Hello.

22:51.308 --> 22:54.667
Hello.

23:09.306 --> 23:09.986
She'll defend my case?

23:10.465 --> 23:11.425
She's a very successful lawyer.

23:11.905 --> 23:13.546
At least you won't be sentenced to death.

23:14.025 --> 23:16.624
But you said you will save me.

23:17.105 --> 23:19.305
And you asked me to trust you.

23:19.784 --> 23:20.423
I did.

23:20.904 --> 23:22.824
Next you asked me to change my lawyer.

23:23.303 --> 23:24.823
Do you take me for a fool?

23:25.304 --> 23:26.223
The who's who of the city..

23:26.703 --> 23:30.943
..want Advocate Verma to defend their case.

23:31.423 --> 23:37.501
These beautiful faces..don't win cases.

23:37.982 --> 23:39.541
Stubborn lawyers like you do.

23:40.021 --> 23:40.781
Get that, old man?

23:41.261 --> 23:44.180
I will make sure you win?

23:44.660 --> 23:48.740
Trust me!

23:49.219 --> 23:50.579
Niyaz..what are you doing?

23:51.060 --> 23:52.699
You'll save me from death sentence.

23:53.179 --> 23:55.819
Have you seen yourself? - Niyaz.

23:56.298 --> 23:58.379
You will save me.

23:58.859 --> 24:00.019
Don't leave me, lawyer.

24:00.498 --> 24:03.858
I didn't kill anyone.

24:16.377 --> 24:19.736
What's she doing?

24:22.335 --> 24:24.095
I already told you that my daughter's fine.

24:24.576 --> 24:25.656
And she's with my mother. Stop following me.

24:26.135 --> 24:27.935
According to the phone records, your mother never called you.

24:28.415 --> 24:29.375
To hell with your records.

24:29.854 --> 24:31.415
My daughter is fine, just get off my back please.

24:31.894 --> 24:33.094
We must apprehend that kidnapper.

24:33.574 --> 24:34.453
You will apprehend him?

24:34.934 --> 24:35.773
He knows every move that you make.

24:36.253 --> 24:38.453
Look, Mrs. Verma, we're trying.. - Just forget it.

24:38.933 --> 24:41.813
The long arms of your law were too short for my daughter.

24:42.293 --> 24:43.892
My daughter is back, that's all that matters.

24:44.373 --> 24:45.453
What are you doing?

24:45.932 --> 24:48.852
I don't care whether you apprehend the kidnapper or not. - Mrs. Verma!

24:49.331 --> 24:52.691
Move it..come on.

25:08.929 --> 25:12.289
Hello. - Boman speaking, ma'am. Niyaz wants to meet you.

25:20.488 --> 25:21.288
Listen..

25:21.767 --> 25:23.687
Your old mother has diabetes.

25:24.167 --> 25:27.327
And you needed money for her insulin injection.

25:27.806 --> 25:29.646
When you snuck into Siya's home..

25:30.125 --> 25:31.886
..you saw that she was already dead.

25:32.366 --> 25:33.805
You were frightened and ran out.

25:34.286 --> 25:36.365
And in the haste..you left your fingerprints..

25:36.845 --> 25:40.204
..and footprints all over the place.

25:46.404 --> 25:48.044
You're good! You're good!

25:48.523 --> 25:49.123
Very good.

25:49.603 --> 25:50.443
Sign that.

25:50.923 --> 25:55.882
The newspapers are right about you.

25:56.363 --> 25:57.762
By the way, who is the well-wisher..

25:58.242 --> 25:59.762
..who so desperately wants to see you released?

26:00.241 --> 26:02.362
There must be at least a dozen in this city.

26:02.841 --> 26:04.441
I've supplied stuff to many people.

26:04.921 --> 26:06.520
One of them must be repaying the debt.

26:07.001 --> 26:10.361
Someone must be..missing me!

26:24.159 --> 26:25.718
I am sc*** and you seem more concerned about Niyaz.

26:26.198 --> 26:26.599
This is not fair.

26:27.078 --> 26:28.718
Nothing's fair or unfair in friendship.

26:29.198 --> 26:30.837
You said it yourself.

26:31.317 --> 26:33.037
You're taking advantage of my weakness.

26:33.517 --> 26:34.557
Yes, so?

26:35.037 --> 26:36.557
I've been suspended, there's a warrant against me.

26:37.037 --> 26:37.756
I've been evading them.

26:38.237 --> 26:40.756
I've the key..to your freedom.

26:41.236 --> 26:42.716
What is this? - Your bail.

26:43.195 --> 26:45.795
My..

26:46.276 --> 26:46.795
Thank you very much.

26:47.275 --> 26:47.755
Now name your fee.

26:48.234 --> 26:51.394
Be serious, Yohaan..I need your help.

26:51.875 --> 26:54.354
I want to meet Dr. Satish.

26:54.834 --> 26:59.074
There can be only one reason to kill her so brutally.

26:59.553 --> 27:01.913
Victim must have seen the killer.

27:02.393 --> 27:04.472
And the killer couldn't tolerate that.

27:04.953 --> 27:07.592
You mean..the killer and victim knew each other.

27:08.072 --> 27:08.872
Bu****

27:09.352 --> 27:12.231
I spent all my life investigating crime scenes, doctor.

27:12.711 --> 27:13.751
The killer was either cynical..

27:14.232 --> 27:15.711
..or he was exacting some kind of revenge from the victim.

27:16.190 --> 27:18.911
Normally such murders are either well planned..

27:19.391 --> 27:23.630
..or they are impulsive when things get out of hand.

27:24.109 --> 27:26.030
This case is a mixture of both.

27:26.509 --> 27:29.869
The wounds are unplanned and random.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.949
But work after that is the job of a professional.

27:33.429 --> 27:36.228
And before disposing the body, he first cleaned it with alcohol..

27:36.708 --> 27:37.668
..so that there's no evidence left.

27:38.147 --> 27:39.148
But the murder weapon?

27:39.628 --> 27:42.467
A sculpting knife was used as a saw.

27:42.947 --> 27:43.907
Like a saw..

27:44.387 --> 27:47.386
Imagine this is the sculpting knife, and this is Siya's body.

27:47.867 --> 27:50.027
Something like.. - Enough, doctor, don't demonstrate it.

27:50.506 --> 27:52.146
You were going to tell us something more?

27:52.627 --> 27:55.346
Yes, we found traces of a drug in Siya's mouth.

27:55.826 --> 27:56.505
Phencyclidine.

27:56.986 --> 27:59.705
Phencyclidine is.. - Angel Dust. It creates hallucinations.

28:00.185 --> 28:01.585
Quite popular among the younger generation these days.

28:02.065 --> 28:05.424
Known as the Angel drug.

28:08.944 --> 28:09.503
Hello..

28:09.984 --> 28:11.863
How is Sanaya? - She's fine.

28:12.343 --> 28:15.462
I want to talk to her. - In due time.

28:15.943 --> 28:18.222
Listen.. - How is your investigation coming?

28:18.702 --> 28:22.262
By the way, what are those two fools discussing?

28:22.742 --> 28:26.102
You're here? - You're losing time.

28:29.181 --> 28:29.821
Where are you?

28:30.301 --> 28:33.661
Where are you?

28:35.660 --> 28:38.180
You always have two opinions for everything.

28:38.659 --> 28:39.300
Two options.

28:39.779 --> 28:40.819
Organized..or impulsive.

28:41.300 --> 28:42.979
Sour..or sweet.

28:43.459 --> 28:44.979
A crime is a crime, it's not a cocktail of some sort.

28:45.458 --> 28:46.698
So we've agreed to disagree, again.

28:47.179 --> 28:47.698
Again with agree-disagree.

28:48.179 --> 28:51.539
Either you agree or disagree.

28:59.977 --> 29:03.056
Madam..

29:03.537 --> 29:04.936
Calm down..don't move.

29:05.415 --> 29:08.895
Count the stones on the table.

29:09.375 --> 29:13.015
Damn it.

29:13.495 --> 29:14.734
Hello, Professor.

29:15.214 --> 29:16.095
I am Inspector Yohaan, from Siya's case.

29:16.574 --> 29:17.654
I apprehended Niyaz.

29:18.134 --> 29:19.774
We wanted to talk to you.

29:20.253 --> 29:22.173
I am sorry, I don't want to talk.

29:22.653 --> 29:23.253
Yes.

29:23.733 --> 29:24.294
I already said what I had to.

29:24.773 --> 29:28.652
I can understand your pain. - No, you don't!

29:29.132 --> 29:30.812
So..let it be.

29:31.292 --> 29:35.251
That rascal preyed on many more innocent kids.

29:35.732 --> 29:38.052
You don't need to tell me that, Inspector Yohaan.

29:38.531 --> 29:38.971
I know.

29:39.451 --> 29:41.091
The sister of one of those victims wants to speak to you.

29:41.572 --> 29:44.930
Just talk to her, please.

29:49.770 --> 29:52.049
Anuradha Verma.

29:52.529 --> 29:53.290
Garima Chaudhary.

29:53.769 --> 29:54.609
She's a writer.

29:55.089 --> 29:56.769
And wants to convey the pain of all those who have suffered..

29:57.249 --> 29:57.608
..through her writings.

29:58.089 --> 30:01.167
And what about those who have stopped feeling their wounds.

30:01.648 --> 30:05.008
Wounds always open up to each other, Garima.

30:08.487 --> 30:11.847
Thank you.

30:14.886 --> 30:18.565
That's how Siya held her coffee mug.

30:19.045 --> 30:19.725
She used to say..

30:20.206 --> 30:22.965
Isn't this how papa held his coffee mug?

30:23.446 --> 30:24.444
He used to say, if I catch it by the handle..

30:24.925 --> 30:26.644
..it leaves a void.

30:27.125 --> 30:29.445
I don't want a void in my life.

30:29.924 --> 30:32.964
I want to feel it with my bare fingers.

30:33.443 --> 30:36.843
Whether it's a coffee mug..or relationships.

30:37.324 --> 30:40.123
Anyway, I have to leave, mom. - But I just got here.

30:40.603 --> 30:42.643
But I told you to call before coming here.

30:43.123 --> 30:43.842
Who knows whether I'm at home or not?

30:44.323 --> 30:45.122
And even if I am, who knows in what condition.

30:45.602 --> 30:46.603
I am sorry, dear.

30:47.082 --> 30:48.561
I had no intentions of coming here.

30:49.041 --> 30:53.801
I was just passing-by and thought of dropping in.

30:54.281 --> 30:57.560
I can't stop worrying about you.

30:58.039 --> 31:01.519
If you really worried about me, you would've never left papa.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.839
Siya, I've told you a thousand times..

31:05.320 --> 31:07.480
..that it wasn't my decision alone to part ways.

31:07.959 --> 31:08.759
It was your papa's as well.

31:09.239 --> 31:10.079
You forced him.

31:10.558 --> 31:12.358
He had a choice.

31:12.838 --> 31:17.397
He could've left me or his lifestyle.

31:17.877 --> 31:20.318
Anyway..keep this money.

31:20.797 --> 31:21.837
No thanks.

31:22.317 --> 31:25.996
This house and the trust fund that papa left for me is more than enough.

31:26.476 --> 31:29.036
He fulfilled all my demands as long as he was alive.

31:29.516 --> 31:32.795
And he's doing so even after he's dead.

31:33.276 --> 31:36.636
Anyway, I am getting late. Let's leave.

31:41.954 --> 31:45.154
You didn't tell me..when did you get this?

31:45.634 --> 31:46.994
It's nothing, mom.

31:47.473 --> 31:50.473
Even the first step is important for the mother.

31:50.953 --> 31:53.232
And you won a trophy.

31:53.712 --> 31:57.071
Let's go.

32:02.192 --> 32:04.231
Was Siya a girl with independent thinking?

32:04.711 --> 32:06.670
Like her papa.

32:07.150 --> 32:07.911
Lively.

32:08.390 --> 32:11.270
Did Siya take her creativity from him?

32:11.750 --> 32:13.750
Creativity as well as lifestyle.

32:14.229 --> 32:15.749
What do you mean lifestyle?

32:16.230 --> 32:19.949
The same lifestyle that finally took Siya's papa's life.

32:20.429 --> 32:24.468
All night parties..no control over food and drinking.

32:24.948 --> 32:29.268
Work was his life..and life was a never-ending party.

32:29.747 --> 32:32.907
And..what about relationships.

32:33.387 --> 32:35.147
I..

32:35.626 --> 32:39.387
..never interfered in Siya's personal life.

32:39.866 --> 32:41.866
Siya wanted to experience relationships closely as well..

32:42.345 --> 32:44.385
..just like her coffee mugs.

32:44.865 --> 32:47.985
That means..she must have many friends.

32:48.464 --> 32:50.305
She had many friends.

32:50.784 --> 32:53.224
If you don't mind me asking, boyfriend..

32:53.704 --> 32:54.744
Of course she had boyfriends.

32:55.224 --> 32:56.664
I would be surprised if she didn't.

32:57.144 --> 33:00.543
My Siya was just so lovely.

33:01.022 --> 33:03.383
Her world was very big.

33:03.863 --> 33:06.742
There was place for everyone..

33:07.223 --> 33:11.822
Except for me.

33:12.301 --> 33:13.941
I am sorry.

33:14.422 --> 33:16.541
No, I think we should be sorry.

33:17.021 --> 33:19.540
Anuradha, did you get what you wanted?

33:20.021 --> 33:21.980
Done.

33:22.461 --> 33:26.260
I am sorry, and thank you, Mrs. Garima.

33:26.739 --> 33:28.060
Inspector Yohaan.

33:28.539 --> 33:29.659
Yes.

33:30.139 --> 33:32.098
I heard that Niyaz appointed a new lawyer..

33:32.578 --> 33:34.658
..and he's really good.

33:35.139 --> 33:36.057
Yes, I heard it too.

33:36.538 --> 33:39.658
Do you think he can get acquitted? - No, I don't think so.

33:40.137 --> 33:41.777
He'll get death sentence.

33:42.258 --> 33:44.377
He's booked for hell. Don't worry.

33:44.857 --> 33:46.057
I don't know..

33:46.536 --> 33:53.056
I just want that he shouldn't be set free at any cost.

33:53.536 --> 33:56.895
Yes!

34:00.655 --> 34:01.575
So sir, may we take your leave.

34:02.055 --> 34:03.414
If you need anything, you can contact Yadav.

34:03.894 --> 34:03.990
Yes, of course.

34:04.374 --> 34:08.174
Goodbye. - Goodbye.

34:08.652 --> 34:08.893
Sir.

34:09.373 --> 34:14.132
Mr. Ronit's been waiting for a long time.

34:14.612 --> 34:17.492
Excuse me, sir.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.213
Hi Ronit, how are you?

34:19.692 --> 34:20.772
It's been really long since we last met.

34:21.252 --> 34:22.411
All okay? - All good, sir.

34:22.891 --> 34:23.610
Just busy with work.

34:24.092 --> 34:26.292
You were discussed quite extensively..at the party office.

34:26.771 --> 34:29.411
I heard that you're a shoe-in for the post of senior prosecutor.

34:29.891 --> 34:32.489
With your support anything is possible.

34:32.969 --> 34:34.889
Support's always there for you. - Thank you.

34:35.369 --> 34:37.770
I was reading about Niyaz's case.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.529
Niyaz case, sir?

34:40.007 --> 34:43.368
I've heard that advocate Verma has taken up this case.

34:43.849 --> 34:47.009
Is it true? - Yes, sir. It's true.

34:47.487 --> 34:53.607
Ronit, our party has raised the issue of women safety and anti-rape.

34:54.088 --> 34:55.568
If Anuradha manages to get Niyaz acquitted..

34:56.047 --> 34:58.807
..then it can be a big embarrassment.

34:59.287 --> 35:01.287
She can't, sir.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.367
It's an open and shut case.

35:03.846 --> 35:08.965
She just can't win. - Good.

35:09.445 --> 35:12.805
Good!

35:18.404 --> 35:23.843
Sunny boy..you must open it. Or else I'll break your head.

35:24.323 --> 35:27.442
Sorry, I can't open it. - What do you mean?

35:27.923 --> 35:28.682
You're the Newton of lock picking.

35:29.163 --> 35:30.123
And you can't crack this?

35:30.603 --> 35:31.842
Go and call your father, Einstein.

35:32.322 --> 35:33.722
Sir, it's German made, the latest piece.

35:34.202 --> 35:35.681
No one can open this.

35:36.161 --> 35:37.881
You can break my head.

35:38.361 --> 35:39.241
There must be some way.

35:39.721 --> 35:40.481
Just try something.

35:40.961 --> 35:41.440
There is one way.

35:41.921 --> 35:43.281
Give me the hammer. - Here.

35:43.760 --> 35:47.120
Move back. - Yes.

35:57.318 --> 35:59.718
I am suspended, but I am still a police officer.

36:00.199 --> 36:01.678
Breaking and entering, damaging property..

36:02.158 --> 36:03.317
..and what other laws are you making me break.

36:03.798 --> 36:05.637
The law isn't blind, like they show in films.

36:06.118 --> 36:07.116
It's always watching.

36:07.597 --> 36:10.957
I'm surely a dead man.

36:20.435 --> 36:22.436
He must have caught hold of her there.

36:22.915 --> 36:26.275
Then the hall.

36:30.554 --> 36:32.433
Stop. Stop.

36:32.914 --> 36:36.032
He raped Siya on this table.

36:36.513 --> 36:38.953
You..

36:39.432 --> 36:41.472
And after getting raped..Siya tried to save herself.

36:41.952 --> 36:44.071
She was alive until she got here.

36:44.552 --> 36:46.231
After that her assailant came up behind her.

36:46.712 --> 36:50.070
And killed her here.

36:54.871 --> 36:56.391
The incident began in the bedroom..

36:56.870 --> 36:59.429
..but there were no signs of forced entry.

36:59.910 --> 37:04.909
That means..Siya knew her murderer.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.629
But what can be the connection between Siya and Niyaz?

37:08.109 --> 37:09.508
I mean..

37:09.988 --> 37:12.668
Why would she let Niyaz in her bedroom?

37:13.148 --> 37:16.227
Anu, this is our job.

37:16.707 --> 37:18.627
We will never frame an innocent man.

37:19.106 --> 37:20.306
Especially in such cases.

37:20.787 --> 37:22.147
Niyaz is guilty.

37:22.626 --> 37:25.946
No one can be 100% sure in such cases.

37:26.426 --> 37:29.666
How can you be?

37:30.145 --> 37:31.266
I don't get this.

37:31.745 --> 37:32.785
There are fingerprints scattered all over the place..

37:33.265 --> 37:34.665
..as well as his footprints. - Yeah.

37:35.145 --> 37:39.105
The murderer was clever to clean Siya's body with alcohol..

37:39.585 --> 37:42.983
..so there's no DNA for evidence.

37:43.463 --> 37:46.823
Whether it's a race or case..you never give up.

37:50.663 --> 37:53.702
You said something? - No..nothing.

37:54.183 --> 37:57.542
Coffee.

37:59.902 --> 38:03.541
How do you live in this mess? - I don't.

38:04.021 --> 38:07.660
I only wait here.

38:08.141 --> 38:14.739
That night, someone came with Siya to her studio.

38:15.220 --> 38:18.539
Siya was drunk.

38:19.019 --> 38:23.499
Something happened between the two..and he killed her.

38:23.978 --> 38:25.458
Must have killed her then and there.

38:25.938 --> 38:29.297
Niyaz came to the studio after Siya's murder. To steal.

38:40.056 --> 38:43.416
And slipped on Siya's blood which was already there.

38:49.574 --> 38:53.814
He was scared. He panicked.

38:54.293 --> 38:55.573
Hence the footprints.

38:56.053 --> 38:58.573
This means someone was there.

38:59.052 --> 39:02.933
We must find out who that was.

39:03.412 --> 39:05.172
It's surprising that you didn't find Siya's car.

39:05.652 --> 39:07.172
We found her killer, why would we need her car?

39:07.652 --> 39:08.772
Find it as soon as possible.

39:09.251 --> 39:10.371
Anu, being a workaholic is one thing..

39:10.852 --> 39:13.532
..but what you're doing is an obsession.

39:14.011 --> 39:17.371
Give me one solid reason why Niyaz is not the murderer?

39:22.570 --> 39:24.090
And you haven't called Sanaya once..

39:24.570 --> 39:26.210
..to know whether she's returned from school..

39:26.689 --> 39:27.889
..or whether she has eaten.

39:28.369 --> 39:30.169
Sanaya's fine..

39:30.649 --> 39:34.009
..she's with her grandma.

39:44.166 --> 39:49.766
"I wonder what your city's intentions are?"

39:50.247 --> 39:55.845
"I wonder what your city's intentions are?"

39:56.325 --> 40:01.405
"There is less sky.."

40:01.885 --> 40:06.764
"..and more birds."

40:07.244 --> 40:10.603
"I wonder what your city's intentions are?"

40:20.202 --> 40:25.681
"A share of joy, share of sorrow."

40:26.160 --> 40:32.121
"A share of a gulp, and a share of the breath."

40:32.600 --> 40:38.279
"And a share of the wound and relief."

40:38.759 --> 40:44.318
"A tale of heart shattering."

40:44.798 --> 40:50.437
"I wonder what charade is your love."

40:50.918 --> 40:56.437
"I wonder what charade is your love."

40:56.917 --> 41:01.716
"Seems like a culprit at night."

41:02.196 --> 41:08.196
"And like God during the day."

41:08.675 --> 41:10.074
Hello. - Where are you?

41:10.555 --> 41:11.355
You're still awake.

41:11.835 --> 41:13.314
I am going after Benny. - Where?

41:13.794 --> 41:16.114
Last place where Siya was seen before she was murdered.

41:16.594 --> 41:18.473
Stop trying to put Sherlock Homes out of job..

41:18.953 --> 41:20.834
..Benny has a strong alibi that he wasn't there.

41:21.314 --> 41:22.833
It doesn't take much to make a alibi, Yohaan.

41:23.313 --> 41:24.393
Anyone can do it.

41:24.873 --> 41:26.913
Do you know what the time is?

41:27.392 --> 41:29.432
You've been awake all night. Get some sleep.

41:29.912 --> 41:32.031
Sleep is..like a lover.

41:32.512 --> 41:34.311
Don't give it ample time and it starts to deceive you..

41:34.792 --> 41:37.512
..and it's not easy to cajole her.

41:37.991 --> 41:38.191
Sleep.

41:38.671 --> 41:39.311
You were awake too.

41:39.791 --> 41:41.751
The night is like my companion.

41:42.230 --> 41:43.151
It stays awake with me..

41:43.630 --> 41:47.710
..and in the morning it hands me over to the dawn, safe and sound.

41:48.190 --> 41:50.988
And the dawn makes me run.

41:51.469 --> 41:56.469
Run Yohaan, run!

41:56.949 --> 41:58.988
Hello.

41:59.469 --> 42:02.828
Hello.

42:04.187 --> 42:07.547
Hello.

42:10.626 --> 42:13.666
"Sweetheart.. Let's set the mood.."

42:14.145 --> 42:17.186
"Sweetheart.. Let's set the mood.."

42:17.665 --> 42:19.465
"Sweetheart.. Let's set the mood for tonight."

42:19.945 --> 42:22.945
"I'm going to park my car in front of your gate."

42:23.424 --> 42:26.624
"Be there at 11:15, baby..and don't be late."

42:27.104 --> 42:30.103
"Don't waste my time, I've got other things to do."

42:30.584 --> 42:33.583
"Entry's not a problem, your beloved's well known."

42:34.063 --> 42:37.223
"Wear the dress I got you for your birthday."

42:37.703 --> 42:40.702
"After the party, baby..we'll go back to my place."

42:41.183 --> 42:44.021
"We're going to have fun and call your friends over too."

42:44.502 --> 42:47.342
"Just get in the car baby, and we'll set the mood too."

42:47.821 --> 42:50.741
"All we have is tonight."

42:51.220 --> 42:54.380
"I'm busy this weekend something's come up."

42:54.860 --> 42:57.900
"Baby, let's get excited, and tonight.."

42:58.380 --> 43:05.018
"Just get me in the club."

43:05.499 --> 43:09.858
"Just get me in the club."

43:10.338 --> 43:13.698
Benny.

43:16.498 --> 43:19.017
"Let's set the mood for tonight."

43:19.498 --> 43:23.016
"Sweetheart."

43:23.496 --> 43:26.176
Benny!

43:26.656 --> 43:28.736
"Sweetheart..let's set the mood."

43:29.216 --> 43:31.496
Benny..wait.

43:31.975 --> 43:36.535
Benny, stop.

43:37.015 --> 43:38.374
Stop following me.

43:38.854 --> 43:41.534
Benny, I just want some answers. - I won't tell you anything.

43:42.014 --> 43:45.213
Get lost. - Benny..

43:45.693 --> 43:49.013
Give some answers.

43:49.493 --> 43:52.852
Die.

43:56.131 --> 43:59.491
Get lost.

44:03.131 --> 44:06.490
Benny..!

44:09.089 --> 44:11.409
Benny!

44:11.890 --> 44:15.170
Where were you that night?

44:15.649 --> 44:17.689
I just want some answers, Benny.

44:18.169 --> 44:21.529
Where are you?

44:27.807 --> 44:31.647
Benny..you're like a government job.

44:32.126 --> 44:35.486
Hard to get.. only available to the lucky few.

44:48.644 --> 44:49.804
Narcotics!

44:50.284 --> 44:51.405
You'll be behind bars for 20 years.

44:51.884 --> 44:53.324
You're not a cop anymore.

44:53.804 --> 44:54.524
I know my rights.

44:55.004 --> 44:55.204
Right?

44:55.683 --> 44:57.603
Rights.. In India?

44:58.084 --> 44:59.883
You watch too many Hollywood films.

45:00.362 --> 45:03.722
This is Bollywood.

45:05.682 --> 45:07.122
Tell us what happened with Siya that night..

45:07.602 --> 45:08.562
..you can go home in a taxi.

45:09.042 --> 45:10.202
Or else..the hospital in a ambulance.

45:10.681 --> 45:10.841
Choose.

45:11.322 --> 45:12.641
The murderer's been caught.

45:13.121 --> 45:15.161
So why are you after me? - You can be the murderer as well.

45:15.641 --> 45:16.001
Go to hell..

45:16.481 --> 45:18.560
Manners..Hollywood.

45:19.040 --> 45:23.840
Speak up, or you'll miss this arm forever.

45:24.319 --> 45:27.199
Siya was a nice girl..until she met that rascal.

45:27.679 --> 45:28.279
Who?

45:28.759 --> 45:29.398
They both met at a club.

45:29.879 --> 45:30.879
He used to study in America.

45:31.359 --> 45:31.998
He has his nose pierced.

45:32.478 --> 45:33.638
He wore a nose ring.

45:34.119 --> 45:34.718
How did he look?

45:35.198 --> 45:38.557
Look into Siya's computer, it's filled with his pictures.

45:47.476 --> 45:50.676
Mrs. Verma, Sanaya's condition is serious.

45:51.156 --> 45:52.035
She's having problem breathing.

45:52.515 --> 45:54.955
I think it's something she ate.

45:55.435 --> 45:56.755
Take her to the hospital. Damn it.

45:57.234 --> 45:58.955
What are you saying, Mrs. Verma?

45:59.435 --> 46:01.714
How can I take a hostage to the hospital?

46:02.195 --> 46:04.355
I'll tell you where to get her medications.

46:04.834 --> 46:06.593
Get there as soon as you can.

46:07.074 --> 46:10.433
I am on my way.

46:43.949 --> 46:47.508
Now. - Do you see the dog?

46:47.988 --> 46:48.828
Put the car keys and the medicines..

46:49.307 --> 46:52.667
..in the dog's backpack.

47:01.426 --> 47:04.786
Untie the dog.

47:10.065 --> 47:11.504
The dosage is written on the bottles.

47:11.985 --> 47:13.904
There's a box behind you.

47:14.384 --> 47:17.744
A small gift to cheer you up.

47:41.260 --> 47:44.620
My girl.

47:51.380 --> 47:55.059
Mama!

47:55.538 --> 48:00.778
Mama!

48:01.257 --> 48:06.617
Sanaya!

48:07.097 --> 48:10.296
Mama!

48:10.776 --> 48:14.136
Mama!

48:16.575 --> 48:17.575
Sanaya!

48:18.055 --> 48:19.176
Mama!

48:19.655 --> 48:23.015
Sanaya!

48:24.414 --> 48:27.774
Mama!

48:55.171 --> 48:58.529
Sanaya!

49:54.602 --> 49:57.962
Sanaya!

51:03.832 --> 51:04.752
When there is no trust in relationships..

51:05.232 --> 51:08.631
..and no network on a mobile, people start playing games.

51:09.112 --> 51:10.751
What game are you playing, Anu?

51:11.231 --> 51:11.951
What are you doing here?

51:12.431 --> 51:14.551
I should be asking you the same question.

51:15.030 --> 51:15.951
Who called you here?

51:16.431 --> 51:18.590
Who called me here?

51:19.070 --> 51:20.630
Ask your face..your eyes.

51:21.110 --> 51:24.149
Your weariness and exhaustion.

51:24.629 --> 51:26.029
Where's Sanaya? - With her grandma.

51:26.509 --> 51:28.388
Where's Sanaya? - I said she's with her grandma.

51:28.869 --> 51:30.308
Let me talk to her. I want to talk to her!

51:30.789 --> 51:31.989
Where is Sanaya?

51:32.468 --> 51:35.108
I heard you screaming, Anuradha.

51:35.588 --> 51:36.348
Where's Sanaya?

51:36.828 --> 51:40.188
Someone has kidnapped my Sanaya, Yohaan.

51:43.187 --> 51:45.746
And the ransom's Niyaz's freedom.

51:46.226 --> 51:48.426
Is that why you took up this case?

51:48.906 --> 51:51.025
If I hadn't, they would've killed her..

51:51.505 --> 51:53.106
..or maybe done something more terrible, Yohaan.

51:53.585 --> 51:55.186
I don't know.

51:55.665 --> 51:57.984
Fine, you did what you had to.

51:58.464 --> 51:59.504
Now I'll do what I have to.

51:59.985 --> 52:00.465
Yohaan..

52:00.945 --> 52:01.544
No, no, no..

52:02.024 --> 52:02.744
Yohaan, no.

52:03.224 --> 52:04.184
No!

52:04.664 --> 52:06.543
Listen.. No!

52:07.024 --> 52:09.022
Listen, you won't do anything. - You think you can stop me?

52:09.503 --> 52:10.543
Maybe not, but I can request you.

52:11.023 --> 52:11.823
Why request? You're used to giving orders.

52:12.302 --> 52:12.623
Order me!

52:13.102 --> 52:14.263
I am begging you as a friend, Yohaan.

52:14.742 --> 52:15.822
Friend?

52:16.303 --> 52:18.222
If I was a friend, you would've come to me first.

52:18.702 --> 52:20.661
Why didn't you tell me?

52:21.141 --> 52:23.821
I wanted to come to you, Yohaan, trust me.

52:24.301 --> 52:26.021
But I was scared that you might react this way.

52:26.501 --> 52:28.260
He should've been scared, not you.

52:28.740 --> 52:30.820
He knows everything, Yohaan.

52:31.301 --> 52:34.180
Places I go, people I meet.. Everything.

52:34.660 --> 52:35.260
Yesterday at the restaurant..

52:35.739 --> 52:38.779
..he overheard everything we spoke.

52:39.258 --> 52:41.139
Maybe he was right there.

52:41.619 --> 52:42.618
I am telling you, Yohaan.

52:43.098 --> 52:45.219
There's nothing I could do.

52:45.698 --> 52:47.418
Why didn't you tell me?

52:47.897 --> 52:51.017
You should've told me.

52:51.497 --> 52:52.457
Yohaan, please..

52:52.936 --> 52:53.817
You should've told me.

52:54.296 --> 52:57.656
I could not tell you.

53:03.216 --> 53:05.415
My Sanaya's gone, Yohaan.

53:05.894 --> 53:10.655
We haven't lost Sanaya yet. - My Sanaya's gone.

53:11.135 --> 53:14.494
Anuradha, we haven't lost Sanaya. - I can't.

53:21.173 --> 53:24.613
I almost lost Sanaya once before.

53:25.092 --> 53:26.973
I got pregnant..

53:27.453 --> 53:30.532
..and my husband found out it was a girl.

53:31.012 --> 53:32.651
He said..

53:33.131 --> 53:34.651
..we can have a daughter later.

53:35.132 --> 53:38.450
First I want a son.

53:38.931 --> 53:41.371
Even my in-laws wanted a boy.

53:41.850 --> 53:43.411
I was so lonely.

53:43.890 --> 53:46.810
I had loved him you know.

53:47.289 --> 53:50.129
I even stopped practicing law for his sake.

53:50.609 --> 53:54.089
Settled down in America.

53:54.568 --> 53:57.808
It was our child..

53:58.289 --> 54:03.487
..and he said "Abort it".

54:03.966 --> 54:05.886
Kill my daughter.

54:06.366 --> 54:09.726
My Sanaya!

54:12.806 --> 54:16.245
A man becomes a father after the child is born.

54:16.725 --> 54:19.685
But a woman becomes a mother..

54:20.164 --> 54:25.444
..from the time the child starts developing in her womb.

54:25.923 --> 54:32.683
A man can say "Abort the child"..

54:33.163 --> 54:37.123
..but not a mother.

54:37.602 --> 54:40.482
I fled from those murderers.

54:40.962 --> 54:44.561
Away from the world, that had no place for my child.

54:45.042 --> 54:48.000
I almost lost her once, I can't lose her again.

54:48.481 --> 54:51.240
You will not lose her.

54:51.721 --> 54:54.160
You know, sometimes Sanaya would call me.

54:54.640 --> 54:55.800
She would say "Mama has no time".

54:56.279 --> 54:58.840
"She's always busy."

54:59.319 --> 55:02.479
I wonder how she looked up to me.

55:02.959 --> 55:07.958
But I've always seen a daughter in her.

55:08.438 --> 55:09.238
Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder..

55:09.718 --> 55:12.237
..if I die now, what am I going to miss?

55:12.718 --> 55:17.358
My job, uniform, money, alcohol?

55:17.837 --> 55:22.397
I wonder..and see two faces in front of me.

55:22.876 --> 55:25.876
Sanaya and you.

55:26.356 --> 55:29.195
The time to shed tears is over.

55:29.675 --> 55:33.035
Get up.

55:38.954 --> 55:42.314
The battle will now begin.

55:55.112 --> 55:57.192
Only Niyaz's lawyer comes to meet him in jail. - Yes.

55:57.671 --> 55:58.511
If anyone else pays him a visit..

55:58.991 --> 56:02.351
..inform me immediately. - Sure, sir.

56:04.710 --> 56:06.311
Hey, Joe. - What a surprise, sir.

56:06.790 --> 56:08.230
Save it for later, first here's what I want you to do.

56:08.710 --> 56:11.029
What, sir? - Do you know about Niyaz's case?

56:11.509 --> 56:12.269
Not much.

56:12.749 --> 56:13.869
Check the records.

56:14.350 --> 56:17.709
I want a list of his old cell mates. - Okay.

56:24.547 --> 56:26.467
Anu, I'm close to Niyaz's hutment.

56:26.947 --> 56:28.388
I am sure the kidnapper's somewhere around.

56:28.867 --> 56:32.227
Go to Siya's studio and check her computer.

56:51.904 --> 56:53.704
Ms. Verma.

56:54.184 --> 56:58.863
I am sorry..but did you have to break the lock of the door..

56:59.343 --> 57:00.783
..to get into my daughter's life?

57:01.263 --> 57:02.662
I am sorry, I..

57:03.142 --> 57:05.742
Yohaan said that it's okay. I can stop this.

57:06.221 --> 57:08.222
No, it's okay.

57:08.701 --> 57:14.341
After Siya's demise..I felt a void around me.

57:14.821 --> 57:18.380
And to fill that void..I kept everything in a way..

57:18.860 --> 57:21.420
..so to feel that Siya's still here.

57:21.900 --> 57:26.340
I saw that..most of Siya's artwork were incomplete.

57:26.819 --> 57:27.659
Why?

57:28.139 --> 57:31.418
Siya was very impatient.

57:31.897 --> 57:34.498
She would start her next sculpture or painting..

57:34.978 --> 57:36.537
..before finishing the previous one.

57:37.018 --> 57:38.657
She would get bored easily.

57:39.137 --> 57:42.697
Was she same with her relationships? - Maybe.

57:43.176 --> 57:44.416
Like her papa..

57:44.897 --> 57:46.336
Why did you two part ways?

57:46.816 --> 57:48.896
That's the irony.

57:49.376 --> 57:51.416
His habits, which attracted me towards him..

57:51.896 --> 57:54.975
..later became the reason of our separation.

57:55.455 --> 57:59.974
His creativity..his attitude and his..carelessness.

58:00.454 --> 58:02.173
Any other reason?

58:02.654 --> 58:04.453
Dhananjay's affairs.

58:04.934 --> 58:08.012
I didn't tell Siya about her papa's affairs.

58:08.493 --> 58:11.893
Because..it would shatter the image of an ideal man..

58:12.372 --> 58:13.892
..that existed in her heart.

58:14.372 --> 58:16.532
So I stayed quiet..

58:17.011 --> 58:19.932
..and Siya drifted away.

58:20.411 --> 58:22.971
Do you think the court will change Niyaz's death sentence..

58:23.451 --> 58:24.891
..to life imprisonment?

58:25.371 --> 58:27.411
Or..he'll get bail.

58:27.891 --> 58:29.730
Nothing is impossible for his lawyer.

58:30.210 --> 58:33.209
I am sorry I've to take this phone call.

58:33.690 --> 58:37.048
Excuse me.. so sorry!

58:46.448 --> 58:48.367
Ram. - Welcome, sir. Welcome.

58:48.848 --> 58:49.287
Call your boss.

58:49.767 --> 58:50.407
Sir, even without the uniform..

58:50.887 --> 58:52.166
..you still mean the same for us as always.

58:52.647 --> 58:53.887
A yellow Nano went missing on the 2nd.

58:54.366 --> 58:56.006
Okay, sir. Just a minute.

58:56.486 --> 58:57.966
Boss..Yohaan sir's here.

58:58.445 --> 58:59.925
He's asking about a yellow Nano that went missing on the 2nd.

59:00.406 --> 59:00.885
MH-14-DZ.

59:01.365 --> 59:01.965
MH-14-DZ.

59:02.444 --> 59:03.764
8118.. - 8118.

59:04.244 --> 59:06.603
You've until tomorrow. - You've until tomorrow.

59:07.083 --> 59:08.323
Sir, tomorrow?

59:08.802 --> 59:09.521
How can I get it done by tomorrow, sir?

59:10.002 --> 59:11.361
Even if I put all my boys to work..

59:11.840 --> 59:12.640
If you don't find out until tomorrow..

59:13.121 --> 59:16.479
..then after I'm through with you, you'll look like an old scrap.

59:23.077 --> 59:25.395
The first hearing is tomorrow..at 11am.

59:25.875 --> 59:28.154
Is Niyaz' new lawyer here too?

59:28.634 --> 59:31.992
It's a female.

59:34.952 --> 59:38.110
Mrs. Chaudhary, victim's mother.

59:38.591 --> 59:42.109
Advocate Verma.. - Niyaz' new lawyer.

59:42.589 --> 59:44.989
I had no intentions of lying to you.

59:45.468 --> 59:46.588
I was about to tell you the truth.

59:47.068 --> 59:48.947
Tell me what?

59:49.426 --> 59:53.585
That you met me in order to save my daughter's murderer.

59:54.064 --> 59:56.624
Won my trust..used me.

59:57.103 --> 59:58.982
I didn't use anyone.

59:59.463 --> 01:00:00.462
I was only doing my job.

01:00:00.943 --> 01:00:03.262
Then why did you lie?

01:00:03.741 --> 01:00:07.940
Maybe that pain in your eyes was fake too..

01:00:08.419 --> 01:00:08.939
..which deceived me.

01:00:09.419 --> 01:00:12.298
My pain doesn't need your certificate, Mrs. Garima.

01:00:12.777 --> 01:00:14.936
Nor does your pain need my sympathy.

01:00:15.417 --> 01:00:17.256
Everyone has their own hell..

01:00:17.736 --> 01:00:19.336
..and everyone has to face it alone.

01:00:19.815 --> 01:00:22.814
Just imagine, God forbid..

01:00:23.295 --> 01:00:26.613
..if your daughter had been through what my daughter did..

01:00:27.092 --> 01:00:30.171
..would you still defend that rapist? Fend for him?

01:00:30.651 --> 01:00:36.689
Advocate Verma, your firm defends criminals like Abbas.

01:00:37.168 --> 01:00:37.809
I can understand that.

01:00:38.289 --> 01:00:39.887
But..this scum.

01:00:40.367 --> 01:00:42.567
Any problem?

01:00:43.047 --> 01:00:46.445
And the most decorated officer of the city..

01:00:46.925 --> 01:00:48.125
..is helping you in this.

01:00:48.605 --> 01:00:52.603
Mr. Yohaan, if you weren't suspended..

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:55.083
..then you would've received another medal for this good deed.

01:00:55.562 --> 01:00:57.002
You arrested Niyaz, didn't you?

01:00:57.481 --> 01:01:00.080
And now you're helping her to get him acquitted.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.960
What about your honesty, inspector?

01:01:03.439 --> 01:01:04.158
Did you sell it?

01:01:04.639 --> 01:01:08.997
Garima, life doesn't give everyone the luxury of preserving their honesty.

01:01:09.477 --> 01:01:11.915
Or the liberty to choose between right and wrong.

01:01:12.395 --> 01:01:14.074
Life often brings you at crossroads..

01:01:14.555 --> 01:01:17.554
..where it's difficult to choose whether to save our life or honor.

01:01:18.033 --> 01:01:20.352
What difficulty has life thrown at you..

01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:23.431
..which compelled you to save that monster.

01:01:23.911 --> 01:01:25.511
I cannot answer this question now.

01:01:25.991 --> 01:01:27.351
But I will..when the time is right.

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:28.510
Let's go.

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:33.027
Ms. Verma, I am not fighting for my daughter alone.

01:01:33.508 --> 01:01:35.307
But for all the daughters..

01:01:35.786 --> 01:01:39.145
..whose mother are still waiting for justice.

01:01:44.504 --> 01:01:47.863
Come.

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.459
Did you find out anything?

01:01:57.939 --> 01:01:59.897
Siya's friend's name is Sam.

01:02:00.378 --> 01:02:02.258
He's 23 year old, he's a drug addict.

01:02:02.737 --> 01:02:04.376
And currently he's in Rehab.

01:02:04.856 --> 01:02:08.015
But Sam can't be the murderer. - Why?

01:02:08.495 --> 01:02:10.334
He's been in the hospital since 26th July, 2013

01:02:10.813 --> 01:02:14.172
A week before Siya's murder.

01:02:15.971 --> 01:02:16.652
Typical case.

01:02:17.132 --> 01:02:17.611
Spoilt brat of a rich father.

01:02:18.092 --> 01:02:19.291
Went to America for kicks.

01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:21.650
No education..only divulged into drugs.

01:02:22.129 --> 01:02:23.969
He graduated from Marijuana to LSD.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:25.488
And finally..Angel Dust.

01:02:25.969 --> 01:02:27.528
So are you completely sure..

01:02:28.008 --> 01:02:30.087
..that Sam was admitted on 26th July, 2013.

01:02:30.566 --> 01:02:33.485
Is it on your record? - Let me just check.

01:02:33.965 --> 01:02:35.845
Yes..I'm positive.

01:02:36.325 --> 01:02:38.844
He was admitted here on 26th July, at 4pm.

01:02:39.324 --> 01:02:40.563
This way. - Okay.

01:02:41.042 --> 01:02:44.401
Thank you.

01:03:07.473 --> 01:03:08.192
Siya..

01:03:08.672 --> 01:03:10.752
Did you know Siya?

01:03:11.232 --> 01:03:12.991
Siya was an angel.

01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:16.309
I loved being with her.

01:03:16.788 --> 01:03:19.228
She wasn't demanding at all.

01:03:19.708 --> 01:03:24.867
No pressure.. I felt really free around her.

01:03:25.346 --> 01:03:27.585
Could you please stop that?

01:03:28.065 --> 01:03:30.624
It's driving me crazy, please.

01:03:31.103 --> 01:03:33.143
Stop what? - That recorder.

01:03:33.623 --> 01:03:36.982
I can't bear it!

01:03:39.461 --> 01:03:42.819
Anu.

01:03:46.418 --> 01:03:47.418
Hey.. what are you doing?

01:03:47.898 --> 01:03:49.737
What's going on here?

01:03:50.217 --> 01:03:51.856
Sam's an A-class patient.

01:03:52.336 --> 01:03:55.415
Do you two know that only his guardian can meet him?

01:03:55.894 --> 01:03:59.253
You two please go out from here! Now!

01:04:11.968 --> 01:04:13.208
He's crazy.

01:04:13.688 --> 01:04:17.046
The drugs have short-circuited his brain.

01:04:22.084 --> 01:04:23.164
Turn the car around. - What?

01:04:23.644 --> 01:04:27.003
Yohaan, turn the car around now.

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:44.597
You have only 5 minutes after the alarm starts.

01:04:45.076 --> 01:04:46.356
Okay.

01:04:46.836 --> 01:04:49.994
A decent world doesn't exist anymore.

01:04:50.474 --> 01:04:51.155
Stop, madam. Where are you going?

01:04:51.634 --> 01:04:53.153
I want to see the warden? - I cannot allow you in.

01:04:53.633 --> 01:04:57.472
Now I'm going to be..

01:04:57.952 --> 01:05:01.510
..like the world is.

01:05:01.989 --> 01:05:04.149
Get out..

01:05:04.629 --> 01:05:06.228
Run.. get out.

01:05:06.708 --> 01:05:09.427
Come on..

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:10.347
Move.

01:05:10.827 --> 01:05:11.106
Sam!

01:05:11.586 --> 01:05:12.506
Sam!

01:05:12.986 --> 01:05:14.425
Listen..stop.

01:05:14.906 --> 01:05:16.225
Where's Sam's room? - It's this one.

01:05:16.705 --> 01:05:20.064
Run..hurry up.

01:05:23.183 --> 01:05:24.181
Sam!

01:05:24.661 --> 01:05:27.540
Sam!

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:30.020
Sam!

01:05:30.499 --> 01:05:31.539
Who killed Siya?

01:05:32.018 --> 01:05:33.338
You said you know who killed Siya.

01:05:33.818 --> 01:05:37.577
Tell me everything, Sam. Everything..

01:05:38.057 --> 01:05:39.895
You cannot win.

01:05:40.376 --> 01:05:43.294
He killed Siya, he'll kill you too. - Who is he?

01:05:43.775 --> 01:05:44.574
Who killed Siya?

01:05:45.053 --> 01:05:46.693
What happened, tell me everything.

01:05:47.174 --> 01:05:48.413
Sam. - This is fun!

01:05:48.892 --> 01:05:49.892
Talk to me. Sam.

01:05:50.372 --> 01:05:54.170
Sam, stop this. Talk to me.

01:05:54.649 --> 01:05:57.209
Sam, who killed Siya.

01:05:57.689 --> 01:06:01.047
Sam!

01:06:14.802 --> 01:06:18.161
I told you don't call me.

01:06:24.638 --> 01:06:26.719
Mr. Sunny Singh, what's your line of profession.

01:06:27.198 --> 01:06:28.398
Well..we're in the business of lock and key.

01:06:28.878 --> 01:06:30.238
We make keys..and open locks.

01:06:30.717 --> 01:06:32.236
You must remember that two days ago..

01:06:32.716 --> 01:06:35.435
..I asked you to pick the lock of apartment no. 306. - Yes.

01:06:35.914 --> 01:06:36.835
Could you? - No.

01:06:37.314 --> 01:06:37.514
Why not?

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:41.073
I told you then and there..that's the latest lock from Germany.

01:06:41.553 --> 01:06:42.713
And your honor, even my father..

01:06:43.193 --> 01:06:44.832
..who's in this business for 30 years cannot pick that lock.

01:06:45.311 --> 01:06:48.190
You mean..when you couldn't pick that lock..

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:51.029
..then a clever thief would've failed too.

01:06:51.509 --> 01:06:52.389
Right? - Right.

01:06:52.869 --> 01:06:56.227
Dr. Satish, did you perform the autopsy on Siya's body? - Yes.

01:06:56.707 --> 01:06:57.347
What did you find in the autopsy?

01:06:57.827 --> 01:06:59.706
There were traces of a chemical in her blood.

01:07:00.186 --> 01:07:00.706
Which chemical.

01:07:01.186 --> 01:07:03.385
It's a kind of chemical which is called Phencyclidine.

01:07:03.864 --> 01:07:05.264
Youngsters also call it Angel Dust.

01:07:05.744 --> 01:07:06.944
Drugs to youngsters.

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:08.463
The one they use to get high?

01:07:08.942 --> 01:07:09.182
Yes.

01:07:09.663 --> 01:07:12.261
Your daughter Siya lived with you?

01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.780
No, she lived alone.

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:16.860
Strange, you were a single mother.

01:07:17.339 --> 01:07:18.499
Yet your daughter lived alone.

01:07:18.978 --> 01:07:20.298
Not always.

01:07:20.777 --> 01:07:24.057
Since she turned 18. - Why?

01:07:24.537 --> 01:07:26.336
Did you two have an argument?

01:07:26.816 --> 01:07:28.615
Or was your family breakup the reason?

01:07:29.095 --> 01:07:29.975
Objection, your honor.

01:07:30.455 --> 01:07:32.734
What is advocate Verma trying to prove?

01:07:33.214 --> 01:07:34.972
My motive was to draw the court's attention to the fact..

01:07:35.453 --> 01:07:37.252
..that when girls in a broken family feel lonely..

01:07:37.732 --> 01:07:40.251
..they tread down the wrong path in search of love and support.

01:07:40.731 --> 01:07:42.570
Siya wasn't like that. - Then how was she, Ms. Garima.

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:46.128
My daughter was the most brilliant student of JJ School of Arts.

01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:49.728
But all the artwork in her studio are mostly incomplete.

01:07:50.207 --> 01:07:51.726
Was there a void in her life too?

01:07:52.206 --> 01:07:53.806
There's a void in everyone's life.

01:07:54.286 --> 01:07:56.285
No one gets a complete world, Advocate Verma?

01:07:56.764 --> 01:08:01.044
Can you tell us how your daughter filled the void in her life?

01:08:01.523 --> 01:08:03.721
Like most youngsters do these days.

01:08:04.202 --> 01:08:05.802
With their friends.

01:08:06.281 --> 01:08:07.401
Objection, your honor.

01:08:07.881 --> 01:08:10.640
This case is about Siya's murder, not her personal life.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.678
Your honor, the conditions under which Siya was murdered..

01:08:14.158 --> 01:08:15.678
..her lifestyle had a big role to play in it.

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:18.956
Please continue. - Thank you, your honor.

01:08:19.435 --> 01:08:22.115
Did your daughter have friends? - Who doesn't?

01:08:22.595 --> 01:08:23.835
She had dozens of friends.

01:08:24.314 --> 01:08:26.912
Boyfriends? - Yes.

01:08:27.393 --> 01:08:28.233
She had male friends as well.

01:08:28.712 --> 01:08:30.272
How was Siya's relation with her boyfriend?

01:08:30.752 --> 01:08:31.671
Objection, your honor.

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:33.430
This is just an attempt to humiliate Siya.

01:08:33.911 --> 01:08:35.069
I disagree, your honor.

01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:38.149
To find the real murderer, it's important to find out..

01:08:38.627 --> 01:08:40.828
..who Siya's friends were, what they did..

01:08:41.308 --> 01:08:42.228
..who did she go around with?

01:08:42.707 --> 01:08:46.345
And how did she party, if she did?

01:08:46.826 --> 01:08:50.185
Will you hang up or not?

01:09:01.741 --> 01:09:02.140
Joe. - Yes sir.

01:09:02.618 --> 01:09:04.219
It's a kidnapping case. Send backup. - Right, sir.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.819
Did Siya have relations with a lot of men?

01:09:08.298 --> 01:09:09.937
I'll repeat my question.

01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:13.736
Did Siya have relations with a lot of men?

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.854
Mrs. Garima, I hope you understand what I'm trying to get at.

01:09:17.335 --> 01:09:20.094
I clearly understand what you're trying to say.

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:24.652
You want to prove that my daughter was shameless.

01:09:25.131 --> 01:09:25.852
On what basis?

01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:28.731
Because she had a few male friends?

01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:33.488
Advocate Verma, my daughter was clever, beautiful, emotional.

01:09:33.968 --> 01:09:36.368
Men would hover around her, so what?

01:09:36.848 --> 01:09:37.765
Is that a crime?

01:09:38.247 --> 01:09:40.966
Are you one of those..who always think that..

01:09:41.446 --> 01:09:42.925
..it's always the women who're at fault.

01:09:43.404 --> 01:09:46.524
People who blame the girl and not the rapist after she's been raped.

01:09:47.002 --> 01:09:48.883
They blame her sense of dressing..

01:09:49.363 --> 01:09:51.482
They blame her independent thinking.

01:09:51.961 --> 01:09:53.921
They blame the very fact that she's a girl?

01:09:54.401 --> 01:09:56.000
Ms. Garima, I am sorry to hurt your feelings?

01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.159
No, Advocate Verma. You're not sorry.

01:10:00.639 --> 01:10:02.678
At this time you are just a lawyer..

01:10:03.158 --> 01:10:05.797
..who wants to win her case at any cost.

01:10:06.276 --> 01:10:10.675
If you had any humanity, or sympathy..

01:10:11.154 --> 01:10:13.954
..then you would've understood my pain.

01:10:14.433 --> 01:10:15.633
I dream about my daughter every night..

01:10:16.113 --> 01:10:17.632
..where she says..

01:10:18.112 --> 01:10:21.311
"Mama, save me. I want to live."

01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:22.591
"Help me Mama.."

01:10:23.071 --> 01:10:27.509
Back when she was a kid, even a small hiccup would give me sleepless nights.

01:10:27.989 --> 01:10:30.067
Imagine my condition when..

01:10:30.547 --> 01:10:33.747
..her scream resonates in my ears every night.

01:10:34.226 --> 01:10:37.185
Your honor, I seriously object to these kind of questioning.

01:10:37.665 --> 01:10:40.264
My questions are relevant, your honor.

01:10:40.743 --> 01:10:43.982
Did you know that your daughter took drugs?

01:10:44.462 --> 01:10:46.261
Yes.

01:10:46.741 --> 01:10:49.101
Your honor, please note.

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:50.859
Siya was a young girl.

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:51.980
She lived alone.

01:10:52.459 --> 01:10:55.218
She had lot of male friends and she also took drugs.

01:10:55.698 --> 01:10:57.937
And that night, the lock of Siya's apartment..

01:10:58.417 --> 01:10:59.856
..was impossible to pick from outside.

01:11:00.336 --> 01:11:03.016
So obviously..Siya opened it herself from the inside.

01:11:03.495 --> 01:11:05.454
And Siya's killer, who came into her apartment that night..

01:11:05.934 --> 01:11:07.973
..must have been one of Siya's male friends..

01:11:08.453 --> 01:11:10.453
..whom Siya must have invited over herself.

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:12.612
And not some petty thief..

01:11:13.092 --> 01:11:16.410
..who went there to steal some money for his mother's medicine.

01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:21.129
That will be all, your honor.

01:11:21.609 --> 01:11:27.486
Recess. The trial will continue after an hour.

01:11:27.967 --> 01:11:31.325
Ms. Verma..

01:11:33.125 --> 01:11:36.283
..what Niyaz did with my daughter behind closed doors..

01:11:36.762 --> 01:11:41.281
..you just did that to her character in the open.

01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:44.160
What's the difference between you and Niyaz?

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.999
Nothing.

01:11:53.916 --> 01:11:55.356
Ma'am, I'll find out.

01:11:55.835 --> 01:11:59.314
Madam..you're very good.

01:11:59.793 --> 01:12:03.673
And that Garima..she's such a good actor.

01:12:04.152 --> 01:12:06.232
What a performance she gave in the court.

01:12:06.712 --> 01:12:09.630
"You have no idea what a mother has to go through?"

01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:12.950
Your case is being defended..by a mother.

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:16.788
Not a lawyer, understand.

01:12:54.374 --> 01:12:56.014
Your name? - Nazia.

01:12:56.493 --> 01:12:57.172
Nazia Qureshi.

01:12:57.653 --> 01:13:02.691
You're Niyaz's wife.. Legally married? - Yes.

01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:03.570
Thank you.

01:13:04.051 --> 01:13:05.929
I'll come straight to the point.

01:13:06.409 --> 01:13:10.888
Did Niyaz know Siya?

01:13:11.367 --> 01:13:13.047
Yes.

01:13:13.527 --> 01:13:15.206
Please tell us more clearly..how.

01:13:15.686 --> 01:13:18.205
How did Niyaz know Siya?

01:13:18.685 --> 01:13:20.883
He supplied drugs to Siya.

01:13:21.364 --> 01:13:22.243
What kind of drugs?

01:13:22.724 --> 01:13:23.522
Every kind of drugs.

01:13:24.002 --> 01:13:27.922
Ecstasy. Marijuana. MDMA.

01:13:28.401 --> 01:13:31.280
What did he say that night before he left?

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.199
Like where he's going? Did he say anything?

01:13:33.679 --> 01:13:37.398
He said..he's going to Siya's house for recovery.

01:13:37.878 --> 01:13:39.956
To get the money.

01:13:40.437 --> 01:13:42.796
Your honor, the witness' statement clearly indicates..

01:13:43.275 --> 01:13:44.595
..that the accused knew Siya.

01:13:45.076 --> 01:13:50.833
I mean..Niyaz knew Siya before she was murdered.

01:13:51.312 --> 01:13:54.672
That's all, your honor.

01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:59.869
Wait. Hold on.

01:14:00.349 --> 01:14:02.589
Why didn't you tell me that you knew Siya?

01:14:03.069 --> 01:14:03.987
Was it important?

01:14:04.468 --> 01:14:07.867
I decide what's important and what's not. Understand.

01:14:08.346 --> 01:14:09.825
I told you to tell me everything.

01:14:10.305 --> 01:14:11.305
Didn't I?

01:14:11.784 --> 01:14:14.544
Look..Siya promised that she will return my money.

01:14:15.023 --> 01:14:15.504
I went there to get the money..

01:14:15.983 --> 01:14:17.543
..but when I got there, she was already dead.

01:14:18.022 --> 01:14:19.941
I swear.

01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:22.581
Was she really dead?

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:26.419
I got in the mood.

01:14:31.738 --> 01:14:32.537
I wanted to **** her right there..

01:14:33.017 --> 01:14:37.415
..but then she started fighting back.

01:14:37.895 --> 01:14:41.254
And then I raped her.

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:45.053
I had to kill her!

01:14:45.532 --> 01:14:48.892
Because I knew Siya wouldn't keep quiet.

01:14:55.449 --> 01:14:58.807
That's all.. Happy?

01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:17.561
Seven million?

01:15:18.041 --> 01:15:21.558
Yes. After the old woman dies, Niyaz will get seven million of the policy.

01:15:22.038 --> 01:15:22.918
How can a drug-supplier..

01:15:23.398 --> 01:15:24.118
..get a seven million policy for his mother?

01:15:24.598 --> 01:15:27.037
It's a really old insurance bought in 1978.

01:15:27.517 --> 01:15:30.115
Bought by some Sheikh Abdul Rehman of Dubai.

01:15:30.596 --> 01:15:32.915
Oh, so this insurance is a gift from his mother's old love.

01:15:33.394 --> 01:15:34.594
And what if Niyaz is dead?

01:15:35.074 --> 01:15:36.994
The money goes to the wife..Nazia.

01:15:37.473 --> 01:15:38.712
Nazia. - Yes.

01:15:39.192 --> 01:15:43.191
Oh..that's a new twist in the story.

01:15:43.671 --> 01:15:46.830
Advocate Verma fights to win and winning has become her habit.

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:48.389
She can do anything she wants, sir.

01:15:48.869 --> 01:15:50.548
But Niyaz will be sentenced to death.

01:15:51.029 --> 01:15:55.586
And anyway, I don't like losing after getting this far.

01:15:56.066 --> 01:15:57.105
True.

01:15:57.586 --> 01:16:00.585
Here's the file, sir..the one you asked for yesterday.

01:16:01.064 --> 01:16:02.463
Exactly the way you wanted.

01:16:02.943 --> 01:16:06.983
Abbas..is a mid-level goon.

01:16:07.462 --> 01:16:10.821
Neither big nor small.

01:16:15.139 --> 01:16:18.738
Thanks.

01:16:19.217 --> 01:16:20.177
Ms. Verma. - Yes.

01:16:20.657 --> 01:16:24.016
Courier for you.

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:27.934
Sign.

01:16:28.414 --> 01:16:31.772
Thank you.

01:16:40.249 --> 01:16:41.129
This is fake.

01:16:41.609 --> 01:16:43.728
But tomorrow you can see original.

01:16:44.208 --> 01:16:47.247
And after that remaining parts of your daughter.

01:16:47.726 --> 01:16:51.085
Like this.

01:16:55.564 --> 01:16:56.364
Hello. - Hello.

01:16:56.843 --> 01:16:58.482
How are you? - I'm okay.

01:16:58.962 --> 01:16:59.922
What did you find out about Nazia?

01:17:00.401 --> 01:17:01.642
Look, the situation is that..

01:17:02.121 --> 01:17:04.120
..if Niyaz dies in jail or if he's sentenced to death..

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:07.199
..then the Nazia will get seven million rupees from the insurance.

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:11.038
And that's why she testified against him in the court.

01:17:27.072 --> 01:17:30.311
Yohaan, meet me at the Masina!

01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:34.029
So you said Sam was at your hospital since 26th July, 2013.

01:17:34.509 --> 01:17:35.548
Isn't that what you said? - Yes.

01:17:36.028 --> 01:17:38.228
What is this?

01:17:38.707 --> 01:17:40.627
Sam was at Siya's funeral on 19th August.

01:17:41.107 --> 01:17:42.827
If he was in your hospital, then how can he be at the funeral?

01:17:43.306 --> 01:17:44.065
Is this a bloody double role?

01:17:44.545 --> 01:17:47.505
Well, as per our hospital records he was in the hospital on that day.

01:17:47.985 --> 01:17:48.903
We want to meet Sam.

01:17:49.384 --> 01:17:50.823
Only he can tell us where he was.

01:17:51.303 --> 01:17:53.302
Not possible. He's been discharged.

01:17:53.782 --> 01:17:55.622
How can you discharge him in the condition he is?

01:17:56.101 --> 01:17:58.781
We have to if the guardian says so.

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.420
Who is his guardian?

01:18:00.899 --> 01:18:02.418
I can't tell you, hospital policy.

01:18:02.898 --> 01:18:04.178
Personal information is confidential.

01:18:04.658 --> 01:18:05.578
Madam..

01:18:06.057 --> 01:18:07.976
Please be clear if this is about give and take.

01:18:08.457 --> 01:18:09.016
I can give some too.

01:18:09.495 --> 01:18:10.575
I am sorry, but that doesn't work here.

01:18:11.055 --> 01:18:12.015
Then what does?

01:18:12.494 --> 01:18:13.535
What kind of a powerful guardian was he..

01:18:14.014 --> 01:18:16.453
..who discharged him before the treatment was complete?

01:18:16.933 --> 01:18:17.613
I want to see the hospital records.

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:22.251
For that you will need a warrant.

01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:24.970
If you weren't a female, I would've slapped you right now.

01:18:25.449 --> 01:18:27.290
Out!

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:30.048
Come, Yohaan.

01:18:30.529 --> 01:18:33.486
Only those without a password on their mobile are the honest ones.

01:18:33.967 --> 01:18:36.206
This madam is involved, 100%.

01:18:36.686 --> 01:18:37.086
Ram..

01:18:37.565 --> 01:18:40.085
Sir, we've found the yellow Nano car. - Very good.

01:18:40.564 --> 01:18:41.965
Siya's car has been found. - Thank god.

01:18:42.444 --> 01:18:43.563
I'll get a warrant, and find where's Sam..

01:18:44.043 --> 01:18:47.401
..you head to the junkyard immediately.

01:18:58.917 --> 01:19:03.956
That yellow one? - Yes. That one.

01:19:04.435 --> 01:19:07.794
Wait.

01:19:39.383 --> 01:19:42.182
This..is definitely a nose-ring.

01:19:42.662 --> 01:19:45.381
Then why did Sam tell me that he knew who killed Siya.

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:48.458
It's quite possible that he didn't know what he did.

01:19:48.939 --> 01:19:52.417
The drugs that he's on..create hallucinations.

01:19:52.897 --> 01:19:54.696
But he must remember once he's sober again.

01:19:55.177 --> 01:19:56.656
He won't remember a thing.

01:19:57.136 --> 01:19:59.535
Even if he had cut someone to pieces when he was high..

01:20:00.015 --> 01:20:00.814
..he won't remember later.

01:20:01.294 --> 01:20:02.814
Anyway, the DNA analysis is complete.

01:20:03.294 --> 01:20:05.933
But we'll need a sample from Sam.

01:20:06.413 --> 01:20:07.572
Blood, hair?

01:20:08.052 --> 01:20:09.292
To cross-check the analysis.

01:20:09.772 --> 01:20:11.011
I have one, at home.

01:20:11.490 --> 01:20:12.850
I have Sam's blood sample on a piece of paper.

01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:17.968
Will that do? - Of course.

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:18.648
Hello.

01:20:19.128 --> 01:20:21.507
Anu, I found something.

01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.636
What?

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.772
I was doing a background check on Sam.

01:20:25.257 --> 01:20:26.708
Have you heard about Mahesh Maklai?

01:20:27.192 --> 01:20:30.016
The MP. - He's his father.

01:20:30.499 --> 01:20:35.498
He was hiding Sam to save his political career.

01:20:35.982 --> 01:20:37.596
This case is becoming a big mess.

01:20:38.079 --> 01:20:41.467
I wonder what else might come out.

01:20:48.725 --> 01:20:54.410
Welcome, advocate Verma, how are you?

01:20:54.895 --> 01:20:58.241
You said.. "Pray that we never meet again".

01:20:58.724 --> 01:20:59.895
I did..

01:21:00.378 --> 01:21:04.612
..but what to do, our prayers are never answered.

01:21:05.096 --> 01:21:08.483
Did Mahesh Maklai send you?

01:21:10.539 --> 01:21:16.184
Sorry, advocate Verma. I came uninvited.

01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:20.218
It wasn't a decent thing, but it was necessary.

01:21:20.701 --> 01:21:24.088
Cheers.

01:21:25.257 --> 01:21:25.741
Yes, officer.

01:21:26.225 --> 01:21:27.515
Sir. - Did anyone come to see Niyaz?

01:21:27.999 --> 01:21:29.411
Someone did yesterday? - Yesterday.

01:21:29.895 --> 01:21:30.661
Yes.

01:21:31.144 --> 01:21:31.426
Who?

01:21:31.911 --> 01:21:32.677
Sir, his name is Vijay Madgaonkar.

01:21:33.161 --> 01:21:34.289
Vijay Madgaonkar.

01:21:34.774 --> 01:21:36.306
Absolutely right, sir.

01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:39.128
Isn't he the same guy you apprehended in the Mandara kidnapping case?

01:21:39.612 --> 01:21:40.782
Absolutely right, sir. That's him.

01:21:41.266 --> 01:21:41.749
When was he released?

01:21:42.234 --> 01:21:43.080
Six months ago.

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:45.096
You will find him in Versova village.

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:46.306
Where? - Versova Village.

01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.911
Versova village.

01:21:47.394 --> 01:21:50.782
Okay, thank you. - Yes sir.

01:21:54.452 --> 01:21:57.597
My son has nothing to do with this case.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.782
And that's why you forged the hospital records.

01:22:01.265 --> 01:22:03.282
And when we started inquiring..

01:22:03.766 --> 01:22:05.096
..you got him discharged immediately.

01:22:05.581 --> 01:22:09.249
You don't understand..

01:22:09.733 --> 01:22:11.870
He came home in the morning high.

01:22:12.355 --> 01:22:15.742
In his girlfriend Siya's car..with her body.

01:22:23.201 --> 01:22:23.967
Are you crazy?

01:22:24.452 --> 01:22:27.557
What have you done?

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.621
What have you done?

01:22:31.105 --> 01:22:33.806
It's really unfortunate and sad..

01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:35.218
..that the murderer is someone else..

01:22:35.702 --> 01:22:36.992
I mean Niyaz.

01:22:37.476 --> 01:22:40.419
Right now..Sam seems more like the murderer.

01:22:40.904 --> 01:22:43.767
This is the reason I came here at this late hour.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:46.791
Drugs has put my son in a really bad condition..

01:22:47.274 --> 01:22:50.460
..and the morning that Siya died, my son believed..

01:22:50.944 --> 01:22:53.484
..that I had murdered Siya.

01:22:53.968 --> 01:22:56.468
That's why that fool even went to Siya's funeral.

01:22:56.951 --> 01:22:59.492
And when I found out..

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:03.605
..I put him in rehab with backdate papers.

01:23:03.088 --> 01:23:04.137
What are you doing?

01:23:04.621 --> 01:23:06.314
Stop it. Please don't do this.

01:23:06.798 --> 01:23:10.185
What are you doing?

01:23:11.879 --> 01:23:14.379
Maybe Sam is not the murderer, don't do this. Please..

01:23:14.863 --> 01:23:16.153
What difference does it make?

01:23:16.637 --> 01:23:18.532
Next year I'll be contesting the elections.

01:23:19.016 --> 01:23:21.557
Whether Sam's the murderer or not, how does it matter?

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:25.427
What matters is that such scandals can ruin my career.

01:23:36.154 --> 01:23:36.839
What are you doing?

01:23:37.323 --> 01:23:40.871
Stop it, please.

01:23:41.356 --> 01:23:44.017
I told you..remember?

01:23:44.501 --> 01:23:47.888
What never happened before, happens sometime.

01:23:54.621 --> 01:23:55.912
Abbas. - Yes.

01:23:56.395 --> 01:23:59.783
Did you cut the gas pipe? - I did.

01:24:33.332 --> 01:24:36.718
Are you okay? - Yes, I am fine.

01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:46.768
Oh, God!

01:25:53.422 --> 01:25:55.033
Is this your dog? - No.

01:25:55.517 --> 01:25:55.921
Who are you?

01:25:56.404 --> 01:26:01.727
I am your that father, your mother didn't tell you about.

01:26:02.212 --> 01:26:03.462
If he isn't your dog, then why isn't he barking at you?

01:26:03.945 --> 01:26:07.333
He only barks at cops.

01:26:36.808 --> 01:26:38.986
Where's the girl?

01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:42.252
Where's the girl?

01:26:42.735 --> 01:26:46.929
Where's the girl?

01:26:47.413 --> 01:26:47.937
Where's the girl?

01:26:48.422 --> 01:26:51.808
Where's the girl?

01:26:54.913 --> 01:26:55.841
You will never find the girl.

01:26:56.325 --> 01:26:59.712
Never!

01:27:20.607 --> 01:27:22.824
Anuradha Verma is alive.

01:27:23.309 --> 01:27:27.866
I apologize, I guess my boys are out of shape.

01:27:28.350 --> 01:27:29.197
It's alright.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:33.067
Some get better with age, while some get worse.

01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:40.970
This is my son Sam.

01:27:41.454 --> 01:27:43.874
I want you to keep him safe for some time.

01:27:44.357 --> 01:27:47.180
There can be no room..

01:27:47.664 --> 01:27:48.793
..for any more mistakes this time.

01:27:49.277 --> 01:27:50.930
Don't worry..

01:27:51.414 --> 01:27:54.801
..your son is now my secret.

01:28:03.107 --> 01:28:06.494
I'll be free!

01:28:10.971 --> 01:28:14.277
Where do we meet?

01:28:14.761 --> 01:28:17.019
Done! Done! Done!

01:28:17.502 --> 01:28:20.890
I'm going to be a free bird.

01:28:22.833 --> 01:28:24.769
The footprints and fingerprints from Siya's studio..

01:28:25.253 --> 01:28:26.382
..and the fingerprints from her wallet.

01:28:26.867 --> 01:28:30.696
These are all firm evidence that leave no room for any doubt..

01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:33.479
..that Niyaz murdered Siya.

01:28:33.962 --> 01:28:36.825
And his old records, which include rape..

01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:41.906
..and exploitation of women for his own lust..

01:28:42.389 --> 01:28:45.898
..these records are enough to prove his motive.

01:28:46.382 --> 01:28:48.036
That's all, your honor.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:51.019
Your honor, as the prosecution admits..

01:28:51.503 --> 01:28:57.632
..Siya's murderer could be this Niyaz.

01:28:58.116 --> 01:28:58.641
Silence.

01:28:59.124 --> 01:29:00.253
Defense, please continue.

01:29:00.737 --> 01:29:03.197
Like I said, even according to my investigation..

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.455
..Niyaz can be Siya's killer.

01:29:05.939 --> 01:29:09.447
For the court's information, Niyaz used to supply drugs to Siya.

01:29:09.931 --> 01:29:12.713
But those drugs were for Siya's boyfriend Sam.

01:29:13.198 --> 01:29:18.036
And that night Niyaz went to meet Sam.

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:18.922
You?

01:29:19.407 --> 01:29:21.584
Sam asked for some stuff, I want money.

01:29:22.067 --> 01:29:23.600
Wait.

01:29:24.085 --> 01:29:27.471
Which means another person was present there during the murder.

01:29:41.988 --> 01:29:43.198
What are you doing here?

01:29:43.681 --> 01:29:46.060
Here you go. - Thank you.

01:29:46.544 --> 01:29:47.108
Leave.

01:29:47.592 --> 01:29:49.085
Its new stuff, want to taste it? - No, thank you.

01:29:49.568 --> 01:29:52.955
Leave. - It's good.

01:29:58.923 --> 01:30:02.311
Sam. Sam. Sam. Wake up, Sam. Sam, please wake up.

01:31:16.262 --> 01:31:18.480
Defense council is only making assumptions, your honor.

01:31:18.964 --> 01:31:20.416
There's no evidence suggesting..

01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:23.118
..that Sam was present on the night of the murder.

01:31:23.601 --> 01:31:26.424
Absolutely right, your honor. There is no evidence.

01:31:26.907 --> 01:31:30.496
And it's also true that whatever I just said are just assumptions.

01:31:30.981 --> 01:31:32.553
And I have no firm evidence.

01:31:33.037 --> 01:31:36.304
But does the prosecution have any firm evidence against my client?

01:31:36.787 --> 01:31:37.634
I mean..the murder weapon.

01:31:38.118 --> 01:31:40.658
That so called sculpting knife..which has my client's fingerprints..

01:31:41.142 --> 01:31:41.343
..where is it?

01:31:41.827 --> 01:31:44.488
It's the prosecution's responsibility to prove my client guilty.

01:31:44.973 --> 01:31:47.270
The prosecution has already admitted..

01:31:47.755 --> 01:31:50.577
..Niyaz's fingerprints and footprints found at the spot of the crime.

01:31:51.061 --> 01:31:51.989
Footprints and fingerprints..

01:31:52.472 --> 01:31:54.166
..cannot be accepted as firm evidence, your honor.

01:31:54.650 --> 01:31:56.102
As long as the prosecution doesn't present..

01:31:56.585 --> 01:31:58.682
..the murder weapon with the defendant's fingerprints on it.

01:31:59.166 --> 01:32:01.344
Until then the defendant cannot be proven guilty.

01:32:01.827 --> 01:32:03.401
And Sam was present there too that night.

01:32:03.884 --> 01:32:04.932
Anyone can be the murderer.

01:32:05.416 --> 01:32:07.110
Just because Niyaz is a drug-dealer..

01:32:07.593 --> 01:32:09.488
..it's convenient for the law to suspect him.

01:32:09.973 --> 01:32:12.312
But Sam..is the son of a rich father..

01:32:12.795 --> 01:32:14.811
..who has connections well into the system.

01:32:15.295 --> 01:32:18.601
That's why..the police didn't feel the need to investigate him.

01:32:19.086 --> 01:32:22.593
Even if we believe for a while that Sam murdered Siya..

01:32:23.078 --> 01:32:28.238
..then the question arises, that why Sam killed his girlfriend..

01:32:28.722 --> 01:32:29.772
..whom he loved so dearly?

01:32:30.255 --> 01:32:31.102
What was the motive?

01:32:31.586 --> 01:32:34.250
Watching Siya and Niyaz in a compromising position..

01:32:34.728 --> 01:32:36.319
..Sam got out of control.

01:32:36.796 --> 01:32:40.018
And maybe..he killed Siya in a fit of rage.

01:32:40.495 --> 01:32:42.206
Maybe he was already high..being a drug addict.

01:32:42.684 --> 01:32:45.506
At least Niyaz's fingerprints were found at the murder spot.

01:32:45.984 --> 01:32:47.854
Does the defense council have any evidence..

01:32:48.330 --> 01:32:51.592
..suggesting that Sam was present there that night?

01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:55.013
One..evidence, advocate Verma.

01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:58.832
We've evidence, your honor.

01:33:10.128 --> 01:33:12.633
I apologize..

01:33:13.111 --> 01:33:15.696
..but I would like to request the court..

01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:17.605
..to hear him out for delivering justice.

01:33:18.083 --> 01:33:19.992
Please.

01:33:20.469 --> 01:33:23.810
Your honor, please.

01:33:30.055 --> 01:33:33.197
The night Siya was murdered, were you there?

01:33:33.674 --> 01:33:35.425
Were you there?

01:33:35.902 --> 01:33:35.941
Yes.

01:33:36.419 --> 01:33:38.050
Did you kill Siya?

01:33:38.527 --> 01:33:42.981
No..when I got up, she was dead.

01:33:43.459 --> 01:33:46.799
Someone killed her and left her there.

01:34:09.313 --> 01:34:09.989
So what did you do?

01:34:10.466 --> 01:34:13.808
I took her body home?

01:34:21.642 --> 01:34:25.184
And then your father, Mahesh Maklai cleaned the body with alcohol..

01:34:25.661 --> 01:34:29.002
..and threw it in the ocean to get rid of it

01:34:58.793 --> 01:35:00.423
Answer me, Sam.

01:35:00.901 --> 01:35:04.242
Yes.

01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:07.225
That's it, your honor.

01:35:07.702 --> 01:35:13.430
This means the murderer can be Niyaz or Sam.

01:35:13.907 --> 01:35:15.499
But the real murderer can be identified..

01:35:15.976 --> 01:35:18.203
..only when the murder weapon is found..

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:20.073
..which has the murderer's fingerprints.

01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:22.498
But Sam and his millionaire father Mahesh Maklai..

01:35:22.976 --> 01:35:28.028
..are guilty of all the crimes committed after the murder.

01:35:28.505 --> 01:35:30.215
Moving the body from the murder spot.

01:35:30.693 --> 01:35:31.965
Cleaning it with alcohol..

01:35:32.443 --> 01:35:34.311
..and then throwing it in the sea to get rid of it.

01:35:34.789 --> 01:35:38.488
This clearly proves Sam and Mahesh Maklai's crimes.

01:35:38.966 --> 01:35:41.471
I request the court to reopen the case.

01:35:41.949 --> 01:35:44.296
And to release my client Niyaz on bail..

01:35:44.773 --> 01:35:47.198
..until the real murderer is not found.

01:35:47.676 --> 01:35:50.779
Niyaz has paid a big compensation for his poverty and past crimes.

01:35:51.256 --> 01:35:53.682
I don't say that he should be acquitted..

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:58.734
..but bail is his legal right, and he should get it.

01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:01.479
Thank you, your honor.

01:36:01.956 --> 01:36:03.347
Court orders..

01:36:03.825 --> 01:36:09.393
..Mahesh Maklai and Sam Maklai to be taken into police custody.

01:36:09.871 --> 01:36:13.211
Defendant Niyaz is granted bail.

01:36:26.139 --> 01:36:29.639
Mrs. Verma..I told you..

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:32.106
Abbas might have many traits..

01:36:32.582 --> 01:36:35.964
..but he always repays his debts.

01:36:36.441 --> 01:36:40.379
Goodbye.

01:36:40.856 --> 01:36:42.288
Sorry, Maklai sir.

01:36:42.765 --> 01:36:46.106
Some people don't change with time, they get worse.

01:36:56.130 --> 01:36:57.323
Niyaz, where are you?

01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:59.748
I am out of jail.

01:37:00.226 --> 01:37:02.096
I am a free bird! I am a free bird!

01:37:02.573 --> 01:37:03.886
I am a free..

01:37:04.363 --> 01:37:05.675
Where are you? - I'm right here.

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:09.733
In the car park. Black jeep.

01:37:10.210 --> 01:37:17.329
Viju..I am a free bird.

01:37:17.807 --> 01:37:21.147
Come on..come on..

01:37:58.695 --> 01:37:59.969
Sanaya..

01:38:00.446 --> 01:38:03.787
Sanaya.. Sanaya..

01:38:13.293 --> 01:38:15.798
Madam..stop..

01:38:16.276 --> 01:38:19.736
Stop.. - She's my daughter.

01:38:20.214 --> 01:38:23.554
She's my daughter.

01:38:40.101 --> 01:38:42.568
No, no, no, no.

01:38:43.045 --> 01:38:46.386
Sanaya!

01:38:52.670 --> 01:38:56.011
Sanaya!

01:38:57.205 --> 01:39:02.693
Sanaya! My baby.

01:39:03.171 --> 01:39:06.750
My baby, please wake up.

01:39:07.228 --> 01:39:10.569
Please wake up. Please wake up.

01:39:22.303 --> 01:39:25.643
Water..get water, please.

01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:31.172
Please wake up.

01:39:31.650 --> 01:39:34.990
Wake up.

01:39:39.206 --> 01:39:43.820
Mom. - Sanaya.

01:39:44.298 --> 01:39:47.599
Mama.

01:39:48.077 --> 01:39:51.418
I was scared.

01:39:53.566 --> 01:39:56.907
I missed you, mama.

01:40:06.692 --> 01:40:10.033
My baby.

01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:21.169
Joe..who can go to such limits..

01:40:21.646 --> 01:40:26.221
..to get a murderer and rapist out of jail?

01:40:26.698 --> 01:40:28.488
That Vijay..

01:40:28.965 --> 01:40:32.306
He has the key to this lock.

01:41:06.638 --> 01:41:09.979
Hey.. Stop!

01:41:17.934 --> 01:41:21.275
Move.. Move.

01:41:39.015 --> 01:41:40.367
Tell me who made you do it.

01:41:40.844 --> 01:41:41.560
Tell me everything.

01:41:42.038 --> 01:41:45.379
I will..I will tell you everything.

01:41:53.653 --> 01:41:55.362
Can I come in?

01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:59.936
I'll only take a few minutes, please.

01:42:00.413 --> 01:42:03.914
I am really very sorry, Ms. Garima.

01:42:04.392 --> 01:42:06.698
But they had my Sanaya.

01:42:07.175 --> 01:42:09.562
And I had..

01:42:10.038 --> 01:42:13.102
..no other option other than accepting their condition.

01:42:13.579 --> 01:42:17.238
I know the pain of losing someone, Ms. Garima.

01:42:17.716 --> 01:42:20.501
But..

01:42:20.978 --> 01:42:23.961
..I didn't have the liberty to express my pain.

01:42:24.439 --> 01:42:27.302
Nor to cry.

01:42:27.779 --> 01:42:32.154
I had to somehow..bring my Sanaya back, at any cost.

01:42:32.631 --> 01:42:34.858
You're a mother yourself.

01:42:35.336 --> 01:42:39.194
I hope you will understand my helplessness.

01:42:39.672 --> 01:42:42.416
Is she fine now? - Yes.

01:42:42.894 --> 01:42:45.955
I almost lost her once.

01:42:46.433 --> 01:42:50.848
They gave her something to eat..which she was allergic to.

01:42:51.325 --> 01:42:53.434
She could've even died if I hadn't..

01:42:53.911 --> 01:42:57.253
..arrived on time with her medicine.

01:43:02.582 --> 01:43:08.708
You should always keep a bottle of Lidum in Sanaya's bag.

01:43:09.185 --> 01:43:11.014
How do you know..

01:43:11.492 --> 01:43:14.832
..Sanaya's medication is Lidum?

01:44:01.569 --> 01:44:03.120
Why did you do it?

01:44:03.597 --> 01:44:07.256
Because I didn't have a choice.

01:44:07.733 --> 01:44:11.831
You're a brilliant lawyer..and I knew..

01:44:12.308 --> 01:44:15.649
..that you can get Niyaz out.

01:44:20.819 --> 01:44:24.161
Why did you want Siya's murderer acquitted?

01:44:33.985 --> 01:44:36.849
Your ticket..and money.

01:44:37.326 --> 01:44:39.911
After today I don't ever want to see you again.

01:44:40.388 --> 01:44:43.730
He's inside.

01:44:55.662 --> 01:44:57.452
You've no clue..

01:44:57.930 --> 01:45:01.112
..about the things I had to do to get you out.

01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:04.969
I did things with an innocent girl..

01:45:05.447 --> 01:45:08.391
..which a mother can never imagine.

01:45:08.868 --> 01:45:11.891
Now..you will die.

01:45:12.367 --> 01:45:15.709
A death..that you can't imagine.

01:45:24.271 --> 01:45:27.613
Do you know why Ravan is burnt every year on Dussera?

01:45:32.108 --> 01:45:35.369
To remind everyone of Ravan's crimes.

01:45:35.846 --> 01:45:37.517
There's just one punishment..

01:45:37.994 --> 01:45:43.642
..for physically abusing a girl against her wills.

01:45:44.119 --> 01:45:47.461
He's burnt to death.

01:45:50.643 --> 01:45:51.239
Petrol.

01:45:51.716 --> 01:45:55.495
Can you imagine a death..

01:45:55.973 --> 01:45:59.751
..compared to which even death sentence looks like mercy.

01:46:00.228 --> 01:46:03.092
This is how my daughter screamed as well.

01:46:03.570 --> 01:46:07.308
I can still hear her screams.

01:46:07.786 --> 01:46:09.775
Doesn't let me sleep at nights.

01:46:10.252 --> 01:46:10.967
Echoes in my ear.

01:46:11.445 --> 01:46:12.280
Forgive me.

01:46:13.195 --> 01:46:17.770
Sets my nerves on fire.

01:46:18.246 --> 01:46:23.099
Pierces my soul.

01:46:23.576 --> 01:46:26.678
My daughter's scream..

01:46:27.156 --> 01:46:30.496
..can be subdued with only your screams, Niyaz.

01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:20.813
I burned him alive.

01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:27.654
This could be his only punishment to serve justice to my daughter.

01:47:28.131 --> 01:47:29.881
You're a mother as well.

01:47:30.359 --> 01:47:31.433
I hope you understand.

01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:34.416
No.

01:47:34.893 --> 01:47:38.234
I don't understand.

01:47:40.859 --> 01:47:44.280
Who gave you the right to kidnap my daughter..

01:47:44.757 --> 01:47:47.820
..in order to get justice for your daughter?

01:47:48.297 --> 01:47:53.866
Believe me..I took care of her like my Siya.

01:47:54.343 --> 01:48:01.184
But still..I am guilty for the trauma she went through.

01:48:01.661 --> 01:48:05.162
But even if I am sentenced to death..

01:48:05.639 --> 01:48:07.667
..for getting Niyaz what he deserved..

01:48:08.145 --> 01:48:11.645
..then I will have no regrets.

01:48:12.123 --> 01:48:14.748
Are you okay?

01:48:15.225 --> 01:48:16.497
Yohaan sir has been trying so long.

01:48:16.975 --> 01:48:18.328
And why aren't you answering your call?

01:48:18.805 --> 01:48:21.152
Mrs. Garima Chaudhary.

01:48:21.629 --> 01:48:23.418
Unbelievable.

01:48:23.896 --> 01:48:25.964
You're under arrest for kidnapping..

01:48:26.442 --> 01:48:29.504
..advocate Anuradha Chaudhary's daughter and burning Niyaz to death.

01:48:29.982 --> 01:48:33.760
You will come with me right now.

01:48:34.237 --> 01:48:37.578
Please.

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:44.061
Hold on, officer.

01:48:44.539 --> 01:48:45.971
Do you have an arrest warrant for her?

01:48:46.448 --> 01:48:49.790
Why? Why do you ask?

01:48:53.925 --> 01:48:57.744
Because she's my client.

01:48:58.221 --> 01:49:01.642
And I am her lawyer.

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:04.546
If I can get a criminal acquitted..

01:49:05.023 --> 01:49:08.364
..then I will definitely save a mother.

01:49:58.322 --> 01:49:59.117
Sir. - Yes.

01:49:59.595 --> 01:50:02.935
Customer.

01:50:05.362 --> 01:50:08.704
Customer's come every day, today its hope.

01:50:19.443 --> 01:50:20.397
The apron suits you.

01:50:20.874 --> 01:50:24.056
Keep it on. It's looking good.

01:50:24.533 --> 01:50:27.596
You didn't give me a chance to wear my uniform.

01:50:28.073 --> 01:50:32.051
You didn't give me a chance to thank either.

01:50:32.528 --> 01:50:36.864
I didn't help you for your thanks.

01:50:37.341 --> 01:50:40.683
Then for what?

01:50:42.989 --> 01:50:47.762
Some things are not for saying.

01:50:48.239 --> 01:50:51.819
Thank you.

01:50:52.296 --> 01:50:55.637
Welcome.

01:50:56.831 --> 01:51:00.212
By the way, I've appealed for your case.

01:51:00.689 --> 01:51:01.565
Forget it.

01:51:02.041 --> 01:51:02.757
No need.

01:51:03.235 --> 01:51:05.979
I'm used to this now.

01:51:06.457 --> 01:51:08.087
How's Sanaya? - She's good.

01:51:08.564 --> 01:51:11.469
She's with her grandma.

01:51:11.945 --> 01:51:13.815
Again with her grandma?

01:51:14.291 --> 01:51:14.769
Honestly.

01:51:15.246 --> 01:51:15.644
She's with her grandma.

01:51:16.122 --> 01:51:19.065
Okay, let me speak to her.

01:51:19.542 --> 01:51:21.969
She's with her grandma.

01:51:22.447 --> 01:51:25.787
That's where I am headed.

01:51:29.645 --> 01:51:32.031
Shall I?

01:51:32.509 --> 01:51:34.260
There's a better expression in Marathi.

01:51:34.736 --> 01:51:38.078
See you soon!

01:51:41.498 --> 01:51:44.839
See you soon.

01:51:57.488 --> 01:52:00.829
What, sir. You let her go?

01:52:04.886 --> 01:52:09.103
I let her go because she's my love.

01:52:09.579 --> 01:52:12.921
If she had been my obstinacy, she would've been in my arms.

01:52:39.012 --> 01:52:42.354
"Sweetheart..don't turn your back and leave."

01:52:50.349 --> 01:52:53.849
"Sweetheart..don't turn your back and leave."

01:52:54.326 --> 01:52:58.900
"Sweetheart..don't threshold and leave."

01:52:59.377 --> 01:53:04.627
"My poor eyes are tired of shedding tears."

01:53:05.105 --> 01:53:11.390
"Who did you leave me for?"

01:53:11.867 --> 01:53:17.117
"Please stay..don't go."

01:53:17.595 --> 01:53:22.765
"Please stay..don't go."

01:53:23.242 --> 01:53:26.583
"Sweetheart..don't turn your back and leave."

01:54:00.591 --> 01:54:08.626
"I have grievances..against God."

01:54:09.103 --> 01:54:18.131
"Since you said..you're leaving."

01:54:18.609 --> 01:54:23.740
"The tears don't trickle down my eyes."

01:54:24.217 --> 01:54:30.064
"How do I endure the fire in my heart."

01:54:30.542 --> 01:54:35.911
"Please stay..don't go."

01:54:36.388 --> 01:54:38.656
"Wait.."

01:54:39.133 --> 01:54:41.559
"Don't go."

01:54:42.036 --> 01:54:47.247
"Sweetheart..don't turn your back and leave."

01:54:47.724 --> 01:54:53.969
"Sweetheart..don't turn your back and leave."
