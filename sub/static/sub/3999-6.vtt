WEBVTT

00:21.154 --> 00:23.155
Cece went on a date last night?

00:23.157 --> 00:25.190
Schmidt, why don't you
just read my text messages

00:25.192 --> 00:27.026
while I'm in the shower
like you normally do?

00:27.028 --> 00:29.361
Our Cece has taken a lover?
Good for him.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.231
Don't get weird, Schmidt.
I'm not being weird.
I just said good for him.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.999
You know, I've camped
in that forest, too.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.801
The babbling brook, the
beautiful mountains,

00:35.803 --> 00:37.803
little secret trailway that's
only open seasonally,

00:37.805 --> 00:40.039
and when it is-- let me tell you
something-- bring a camera.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.073
Cool, not weird at all.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.207
Good, you're all here.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.009
I just got a tip
from my buddy Dugan.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.078
My academy background
check is today and I need

00:46.080 --> 00:48.080
everybody's help.
Can't do it, bro.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.249
Going to the outlet mall
today-- I'm gonna look like
What?

00:50.251 --> 00:52.051
a rich person from
three years ago.
Can't... You can't go

00:52.053 --> 00:53.719
to the outlet
mall today. Not today.
Yeah, you can't

00:53.721 --> 00:55.320
go to the outlet mall today.
Why?

00:55.322 --> 00:57.156
It's a weekend-- what
are you, crazy? Unless you

00:57.158 --> 00:58.090
got a game plan.
I have a game plan.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.491
SCHMIDT: Grab a quick
smoothie, power up.

00:59.493 --> 01:02.161
Do my leg stores first.
Pants, socks, shoes.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.529
Hats and accessories last,
then one sweet treat

01:03.531 --> 01:06.398
for the road.
Most likely a cinnamon pretzel.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.867
I'm in. (laughs)
That sounds like a tight
afternoon. I'm in for sure.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.869
What the hell, dude?
I do want to be part
of the pretzel.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.238
This is my life. If I don't
pass the background check,

01:13.240 --> 01:14.606
then I fail out
of the police academy.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.109
Guys, this is an
all-hands-on-deck situation.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.544
If we don't help
him, Winston

01:18.546 --> 01:20.079
will never become
a cop. Remember?

01:20.081 --> 01:22.114
He-He handcuffed
his cat's paw

01:22.116 --> 01:24.850
to a radiator and
then lost the key.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.052
In my defense, I was
making a Christmas card, so...
Okay,

01:27.054 --> 01:29.621
you know what-- I'm gonna
cancel my plans with Cece.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.623
I'll find out about
her date with Paul later.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.559
A ridiculous name.
Oh, hey, my name is

01:33.561 --> 01:36.195
Puh-ha... Pau... I don't even
know how to pronounce that.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.864
It's Paul.
I'll take that Paul, I'll take
him to a water park, I will.

01:38.866 --> 01:41.100
I'll put him on one of those
waterslides between

01:41.102 --> 01:42.901
two obese people and he'll
get smushed to death.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.270
Die in a... Die in a water...
He'll die between

01:45.272 --> 01:47.873
the obese people
before he drowns in the water.
What?

01:47.875 --> 01:50.375
Hmm?
- Schmidt, that is exactly the
kind of talk we can't have today

01:50.377 --> 01:52.111
when the LAPD comes here.

01:52.113 --> 01:55.247
Um... the, uh,
cops are coming here?

01:55.249 --> 01:56.482
Yes.
- Like, here, here?

01:56.484 --> 01:57.483
Yes.
Like, to our home,

01:57.485 --> 01:59.284
w-where we keep our stuff?

01:59.286 --> 02:01.120
Why can't we just
go there? We'll just

02:01.122 --> 02:03.155
go there, a-answer some
questions, get an ice coffee

02:03.157 --> 02:06.225
on the way back-- I really
feel like ice coffee.
It's a home visit, Jess.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.726
And not just from
any cop. It's from

02:07.728 --> 02:09.161
Sergeant Tess Dorado. The Fish.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.230
I'm pretty sure they
call her The Fish because

02:11.232 --> 02:13.332
she's tough but fair,

02:13.334 --> 02:16.602
just like most fish
I've interacted with.
Winston, "dorado" is a fish.

02:16.604 --> 02:19.171
It's a subset of mahi-mahi
and it pairs very nicely

02:19.173 --> 02:21.740
with citrus, you oaf.
I'm not a oaf, you're a
oaf, stupid. (snorts)

02:21.742 --> 02:23.809
So... You're dumb. Shut up.
Also, put on

02:23.811 --> 02:26.245
some underpants, please. It's
like a bounce house down there.

02:26.247 --> 02:29.248
Do you guys think that the cops
are gonna go through our stuff?

02:29.250 --> 02:31.583
What are you afraid of? They'll
look through your dream journal?

02:31.585 --> 02:33.152
No, I just...
What, are you running
a sweatshop

02:33.154 --> 02:35.020
back there for skirts that look
like curtains?

02:35.022 --> 02:36.421
Actually...
What'd you-What'd you,
steal a kiss and

02:36.423 --> 02:38.624
hide it in an envelope?
(all laugh)

02:38.626 --> 02:40.259
I have a bag of meth
in my closet.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.804
Oh, I know it's in
here somewhere...

02:52.806 --> 02:54.339
Oh, oh, ooh. These are my
"bad decision" hats.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.208
Bad decision, right?
How do you

02:56.210 --> 02:58.443
not know where
a bag of meth is?
- Find it and get rid of it.

02:58.445 --> 03:00.445
Find it, get rid of it.
Jess, why do you have meth
in your closet?

03:00.447 --> 03:03.515
Do you remember that
day when I was trying
to convince you guys

03:03.517 --> 03:06.151
to come with me to that
waffle restaurant in the
Antelope Valley that I found?

03:06.153 --> 03:08.554
And you were like,
"That's way too far
to go for waffles."

03:08.556 --> 03:11.390
Turns out you were right-- how
good can a waffle really be?

03:11.392 --> 03:13.825
That's the question
I answered that...
NICK: Tell us the story faster.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.361
Your waffle story sucks.
Where is the bag of crystal
methamphetamine, you dummy?

03:16.363 --> 03:18.730
Okay, fine.
Do you see that footstool?

03:18.732 --> 03:19.998
I bought it at a garage sale.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.400
Turns out the top opens up

03:21.402 --> 03:22.834
and when I opened up the top,

03:22.836 --> 03:24.836
I found-- here it is--

03:24.838 --> 03:28.407
this.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.009
COACH:
Holy frickin' what?

03:31.011 --> 03:32.678
(whoops)
- Aah!

03:32.680 --> 03:34.413
Oh, hey. How do I look?
JESS: Terrible.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.681
N-Not for me.
- Not great.
- Like crap.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.549
Go change.
SCHMIDT: I don't like any of it.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.185
Wow. You guys
are like rubbing alcohol.

03:40.187 --> 03:43.488
You sting me in the now,
but you save me in the later.

03:43.490 --> 03:46.892
All right.
Okay, Winston cannot
find out about this.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.493
Because if he doesn't know,
he can't get in trouble, and

03:48.495 --> 03:51.396
he's probably already failing
out of the academy as it is.

03:51.398 --> 03:54.566
Also, why are you keeping
this in your closet?
What am I supposed to do--

03:54.568 --> 03:56.435
notify the authorities?
I'm sorry, Officer,

03:56.437 --> 03:58.270
I found this bag of meth
in a footstool

03:58.272 --> 04:00.272
I bought at a garage sale.
Uh, no.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.441
My closet is safe. The only
person who goes in there

04:02.443 --> 04:05.410
is me when I'm naked and/or sad.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.713
Hey.
Much better, right?

04:07.715 --> 04:08.780
I found it on the lawn.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.215
(chuckles)

04:10.217 --> 04:11.717
And that's the whole story.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.919
So, you guys ready?
She's on her way.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.288
Why don't you go wait
for her downstairs?

04:16.290 --> 04:18.257
Don't make her buzz up
like a shawarma boy.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.725
Good idea, good idea.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.026
This way, I get to tell
her my sidewalk joke.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.427
You remember
the sidewalk joke, right?

04:22.429 --> 04:23.729
There's a man on the s...

04:23.731 --> 04:25.530
How's it...?
There's a man on the...

04:25.532 --> 04:27.699
Oh, you know, okay...

04:27.701 --> 04:29.268
Everybody just calm down.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.136
Especially you, Nick,
you're already sopping wet.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.272
Lying makes me sweat.
I can't lie.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.607
It's why I don't play poker
or talk to pregnant ladies.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.709
No one has to lie.
I'm just going
to get rid of it.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.744
(mutters anxiously)

04:38.746 --> 04:39.745
I'm gonna call Cece.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.046
She knows about this stuff.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.447
She lived one summer in Milan

04:42.449 --> 04:43.949
with a guy named Crystal Randy.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.317
Ask her about the date.
Hey, Cece,

04:45.319 --> 04:46.752
quick question.
How does one get

04:46.754 --> 04:48.320
rid of a bag of meth?
Call me back.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.488
Ask her if Paul
is taller than me.
- Stop it.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.156
Did she surrender her virtue?
Hey.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.658
Throw it in
the trash.
- I can't see it.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.259
I can't see where it goes,
'cause then when she comes

04:54.261 --> 04:56.261
in here, I'll just yell "trash!"
I'll yell "trash!"

04:56.263 --> 04:58.063
Cover your ears
and sing "Landslide."

04:58.065 --> 04:59.831
SCHMIDT: Let's call Cece again.
¶ Took my love
and I took it down ¶

04:59.833 --> 05:01.266
We need to get this
back in my closet...

05:01.268 --> 05:02.467
I could see your lips moving.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.502
Well, close your eyes.
(Nick singing)

05:03.504 --> 05:04.736
Throw it out
the window, okay?

05:04.738 --> 05:05.504
I'll sneak down there,
I'll toss it in

05:05.506 --> 05:06.505
the Dumpster.
Here.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.973
Oh!
JESS:
Oh, my God!

05:07.975 --> 05:09.474
What the heck, Jess?
- JESS:
I threw like a boy!

05:09.476 --> 05:10.575
I've always thrown like a boy!
You almost hit
me in the face!

05:10.577 --> 05:11.643
What are you, nuts?
- Overhand?

05:11.645 --> 05:12.411
Oh, well, Winston's a goner.

05:15.448 --> 05:18.150
You know, this building
used to be a biscuit factory.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.485
And apparently, the mice
have not been told

05:20.487 --> 05:21.586
it's gone residential.

05:21.588 --> 05:24.189
Was that a joke?

05:24.191 --> 05:26.758
I hate jokes.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.360
¶ ...of changing ¶
JESS: Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.429
¶ 'Cause I built ¶
We just have to hide this.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.464
¶ My whole life around you ¶
Throw it in here.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.666
Come on!
I was bringing it to you!

05:34.668 --> 05:37.202
Why does everybody
keep asking me to throw stuff?

05:37.204 --> 05:38.603
SCHMIDT:
Work on your aim!

05:38.605 --> 05:40.439
This is actually
a really good song.
Nick, stop singing!

05:40.441 --> 05:41.540
Where are we
gonna put this?
- Put it in
the baggie!

05:41.542 --> 05:43.375
Fun Saturday?

05:43.377 --> 05:44.743
No. My bird died.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.380
Well, my mom used to say

05:48.382 --> 05:50.215
when a bird dies,

05:50.217 --> 05:52.484
he gets another set
of wings in heaven, so...

05:52.486 --> 05:55.053
Well, that bird was
going straight to hell.

05:59.492 --> 06:02.461
Welcome to our home.

06:06.632 --> 06:09.000
I will ask you questions.
You will ask me no questions.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.535
In pursuit of that,

06:10.537 --> 06:13.138
I will offer up three
personal facts:

06:13.140 --> 06:14.473
I was born in St. Louis,

06:14.475 --> 06:16.475
I have three brothers,
two of whom

06:16.477 --> 06:18.043
were killed in separate
plane crashes,

06:18.045 --> 06:19.177
and...

06:19.179 --> 06:20.545
I like music.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.147
Good? Good.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.482
Now, let's get started--

06:23.484 --> 06:24.983
My name is Nick.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.485
Nicholas Miller?

06:26.487 --> 06:28.153
I-I don't... I don't know.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.154
SCHMIDT:
Hah!

06:29.156 --> 06:30.489
He's just messing
around with you.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.723
He's our resident clown here.

06:31.725 --> 06:32.724
DORADO:
Let's keep this simple.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.259
I need to be home in time

06:34.261 --> 06:35.660
to feed my bird.

06:35.662 --> 06:36.862
Oh, God.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.663
(light clattering)

06:38.665 --> 06:40.432
Uh, green grape?
Would you like...?

06:40.434 --> 06:41.867
No, thanks.

06:41.869 --> 06:42.768
I already had my grapes.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.169
Jess!

06:44.171 --> 06:45.504
I got your message.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.341
Where's the freaking me...

06:50.777 --> 06:53.745
Play along, or
Jess goes to jail.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.614
What are you doing?
- Hey.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.082
Look, it's my
girlfriend Cece.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.683
What's up, Cece?
- Ah, it's his
girlfriend Cece.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.285
WINSTON: Girlfriend?
Oh, my goodness,

07:00.287 --> 07:01.286
you guys are back together?

07:01.288 --> 07:02.687
Yeah.
- No, uh...

07:02.689 --> 07:03.955
Like I always say, you can't put

07:03.957 --> 07:05.390
peanut butter and jelly
on the same shelf

07:05.392 --> 07:06.792
and expect 'em not to mix.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.427
'Cause somebody got
to eat a sandwich.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.095
It's exciting.
Yeah, no.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.763
Moving on. Miss Day,

07:11.765 --> 07:13.532
in your own words,
please state

07:13.534 --> 07:14.900
why Cadet Bishop
would be an asset

07:14.902 --> 07:16.768
to the Los Angeles
Police Department.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.471
A few kind words. Known
me for a long time.
- Yeah.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.306
It's your boy
Winnie the Bish.
- Oh!

07:21.308 --> 07:22.541
(light clattering)

07:22.543 --> 07:23.642
I have to go to the bathroom.

07:25.578 --> 07:26.878
WINSTON:
If you guys
will excuse me

07:26.880 --> 07:28.647
for just one second.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.916
Okay.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.285
Will somebody answer
the question so I can write it

07:33.287 --> 07:35.454
on the form and we can get on
with our lives?

07:35.456 --> 07:37.722
Why would Bishop
make a good police officer?

07:37.724 --> 07:40.292
Mustache.
I'm sorry?

07:40.294 --> 07:42.260
Because, uh,
Winston has a mustache.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.095
And, uh, police officers
all have mustaches.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.331
No, they don't. Not the ladies.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.732
Unless the
ladies want to.

07:47.734 --> 07:48.600
Why can't a lady
have a mustache?

07:48.602 --> 07:50.836
She can. And it would look sexy.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.004
Would you like a green grape
shoved in your...

07:53.006 --> 07:55.140
given to your mouth?
Handed to your mouth?

07:55.142 --> 07:57.576
I'm asking a simple question,

07:57.578 --> 08:00.512
unless you don't think he would
be an asset to the LAPD.
No,

08:00.514 --> 08:02.581
he-he would.
He definitely would.
Yeah, he would.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.350
You know, Winston has done
plenty for, uh,

08:05.352 --> 08:08.620
the, um... community.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.156
He has a little brother
at the Boys & Girls Club.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.958
Of course. All the work
that Winston does

08:12.960 --> 08:15.260
with the Boys & Girls Club that
he actually does in real life.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.462
COACH: So much work
at the Boys & Girls Club. Yeah.
So passionate.

08:17.464 --> 08:18.830
What was his little brother's
name again?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.532
Duke.
- Juan.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.267
Duquan is his name.
- Duquan.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.702
Duquan.
Duquan.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.504
And I'm Nick Miller.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.305
Hey, let me ask you s... um...

08:27.307 --> 08:28.507
Hmm?

08:28.509 --> 08:29.541
Breasts.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.476
It's my cycle.
- Already?

08:31.478 --> 08:33.979
Damn, girl.
My calendar is way off on you.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.047
You must be, what, like,
ten days early?

08:36.049 --> 08:38.984
Aw, Winston. Someday you're
gonna make some lucky girl

08:38.986 --> 08:40.852
really uncomfortable.
Can you go get Cece

08:40.854 --> 08:42.320
and tell her to meet me
in the bathroom?

08:42.322 --> 08:44.689
Sure. And, girl, uh,
you ain't got a cycle--

08:44.691 --> 08:46.291
you got a roller coaster.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.293
(chuckles)
Don't I know it, girl?
Mm-hmm.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.328
(growls,
chuckles)

08:50.330 --> 08:51.963
Duquan Feldman?

08:51.965 --> 08:55.000
I'm gonna make a note
to call the Boys & Girls Club.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.568
No!
Why not?

08:56.570 --> 08:58.537
Uh, because he's coming here.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.006
Why would... why would
Duquan come-come here?

09:01.008 --> 09:02.407
Because he comes here
every Saturday.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.209
He does?
- Then where is he?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.811
Huh?
It's Saturday. Where is he?

09:06.813 --> 09:08.346
He's at the bus station.
He's waiting for, uh,

09:08.348 --> 09:11.082
one of us to get him,
and, uh...

09:11.084 --> 09:13.752
You know what? I'll go do it.
You guys stay put.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.021
You're gonna go
and get Duquan?

09:16.023 --> 09:17.622
I think so.

09:18.591 --> 09:20.592
Yeah.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.027
You guys, anybody
want to...

09:22.029 --> 09:23.662
come... with? No?

09:32.905 --> 09:36.775
(sighs)
Where are you, Duquan?

09:36.777 --> 09:38.743
Hey. Cece, Jess needs some help

09:38.745 --> 09:40.245
with some lady stuff.
Of course.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.046
You know how we do.
(chuckles)

09:41.048 --> 09:42.047
SCHMIDT:
Whoof...

09:42.049 --> 09:43.682
Gonna...

09:43.684 --> 09:45.850
Must be a rough one.
You know what,

09:45.852 --> 09:47.452
I'm gonna have a look around.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.254
What a great i... You know what,
you should start

09:49.256 --> 09:51.623
with Nick and I's room.
We share it.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.259
Hey, don't mind the condoms.
We've been banging like rabbits.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.962
Not each other.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.964
What are you doing?
Jessica.

09:58.966 --> 10:01.566
No, Jessica! What are you doing?
You do not put drugs

10:01.568 --> 10:04.269
down the shower drain. Have you
never seen a drug movie before?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.771
I don't know. I saw<i> Ray.</i>
That does not count.

10:06.773 --> 10:10.275
I might have ruined Winston's
chances of being a cop.
Well, we can cry

10:10.277 --> 10:13.478
about that later. We are gonna
take the drugs now and we're
gonna go flush 'em, all right?

10:13.480 --> 10:16.281
What are you doing?
Come on. Help me.
Pick up the drugs, Jess.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.949
I think that the meth entered
my bloodstream

10:17.951 --> 10:19.484
through my boob skin.
That is
not a thing.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.785
That's not how drugs work.
I'm the one

10:20.787 --> 10:24.222
on meth!
Don't tell me how drugs work!

10:24.224 --> 10:25.790
Okay.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.161
(toilet gurgling)

10:30.163 --> 10:31.563
Oh, my God.

10:33.499 --> 10:36.768
(exhaling anxiously)

10:36.770 --> 10:37.769
Could you open this trunk?

10:37.771 --> 10:39.471
Oh, I'll do more than open it.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.640
I don't know why I said that.

10:42.608 --> 10:45.110
I'm gonna open the trunk.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.645
(whispers):
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.813
What are you... Oh, my God.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.116
You're a mess. Here.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.618
Cover up. Cover...
No, I'm not putting
that... I'm not putting

10:53.620 --> 10:55.854
on your kimono. It
legitimizes you owning it.
Just put it on.

10:55.856 --> 10:56.788
Put it on.
Okay.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.623
I'm wearing a kimono.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.091
I see that. Why?

11:00.093 --> 11:02.527
Why? Why is he still wearing
pants? That's the real question.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.763
(creaking, clanging)
What's all that going on
out there?

11:05.698 --> 11:07.198
I'm on drugs.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.934
I'm on drugs...

11:14.140 --> 11:15.473
What's all that clanging?

11:15.475 --> 11:17.008
Uh, just a bunch
of clanging.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.777
Well, there's
feminine issues...

11:18.779 --> 11:20.445
It's probably the ladies
playing with their jewelry.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.714
Their brooches.
- You know how...
Brooches. Of course.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.449
Nick makes
a very good point.

11:24.451 --> 11:25.850
I'm gonna go check on
that right now, actually.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.786
Uh, Winston,

11:27.788 --> 11:28.453
why don't you show
the good sergeant

11:28.455 --> 11:29.854
Jess' room?
What?

11:29.856 --> 11:30.822
What a great idea.
Oh, I've had

11:30.824 --> 11:31.823
intercourse in there.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.591
You'll be excited to...

11:36.362 --> 11:38.663
I think I'm gonna take off, too.
Nick, what is going on
out there?

11:38.665 --> 11:40.165
What's going on out there?
No, I'm asking you
what's going on.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.800
Hmm?
- What's going on?

11:43.736 --> 11:46.237
(grunting quietly)

11:49.375 --> 11:50.975
It's gonna be okay.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.844
Hey, what happened
to the "turlet"?

11:52.846 --> 11:54.879
Schmidt, you're here.
So we're in a little bit

11:54.881 --> 11:56.514
of a thing right now,
but you're our best cleaner.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.817
We might be out of towels,
but you'll figure out something.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.685
Right? It's gonna be fun.
- Jess,

12:00.687 --> 12:01.886
are you crying right now?
I don't know.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.254
I hadn't noticed. Um...
(sniffles)

12:03.256 --> 12:05.890
I might be on drugs.
You gonna help mop

12:05.892 --> 12:07.392
or are you just gonna try
to kiss me again?
Oh, please.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.094
You kissed me back.
Your... I felt

12:09.096 --> 12:11.596
your lips surrender. And
who's this Paul anyway? Paul.

12:11.598 --> 12:12.997
What, does he work
in a pizzeria?
- Yes, Schmidt,

12:12.999 --> 12:14.866
I went on a date with a guy
named Paul.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.836
You just need to get over it.
Paul. Paul. Nice name, dude.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.938
Why is your shirt off?
I've seen<i> New Jack City,</i> okay?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.840
They all take their shirts off
in the crack cocaine lab!

12:21.842 --> 12:22.941
Ah, it won't go down!

12:22.943 --> 12:25.210
Hats off to the hillbilly
that made this meth.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.010
Meth?

12:27.213 --> 12:28.213
What meth?

12:28.215 --> 12:30.014
This meth.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.417
It's... legal meth.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.419
It's... medical meth.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.855
For my... cramps.

12:38.224 --> 12:41.292
Wait a minute. Who's with Nick?

12:42.962 --> 12:46.765
¶ I took my love
and I took it down ¶

12:46.767 --> 12:50.034
¶ I drove around
and I hit a pound ¶

12:50.036 --> 12:53.605
¶ And I saw all the puppies
with their ¶

12:53.607 --> 12:55.106
¶ Eyes so blind... ¶

12:58.444 --> 13:01.813
Nick! Nick! Nick! Nick! Nick!
Sergeant Dorado, don't listen
to him! He's deranged!

13:01.815 --> 13:03.414
I'm gonna talk
to this man alone.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.884
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

13:05.886 --> 13:06.951
That is not good.

13:06.953 --> 13:07.619
No.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.188
So, this Paul...

13:11.323 --> 13:12.824
I've never seen
someone sweat so much

13:12.826 --> 13:15.827
in my life. It looks
like your body is crying.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.228
What are you hiding?

13:17.230 --> 13:19.964
Distraction!

13:19.966 --> 13:22.133
Okay. You're a tough cookie.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.068
And that's the last thing
I'll say.

13:24.070 --> 13:26.070
Look...
Okay, you want the truth?
I'll tell you everything.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.173
When I was 13 years old,

13:28.175 --> 13:31.042
I once made love to myself
behind a post office.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.913
Oh.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.681
Hey!

13:36.683 --> 13:38.917
(honks horn)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

13:38.919 --> 13:40.418
Yo! What's up?
You in the shorts.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.154
Hey, come here, man. Come here.
I need a little boy.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.924
(chuckles) Whoa. No. That's not
what I meant. No, no, no.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.292
I didn't mean...
You know what I'm... Ah.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.160
I wasn't trying to...

13:49.162 --> 13:51.162
It's for my friend, you know?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.698
I need you to come over to,
uh, hang out with my friends.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.868
No, not like that.
I just need you to pretend

13:56.870 --> 13:58.870
like, uh,
you're in a relationship

13:58.872 --> 14:02.807
with this grown man that I know.
Ah! Ah! Uh, I did not

14:02.809 --> 14:04.209
think this through.
Did not think this through.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.977
Um, bad decision.
Very bad decision.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.279
I'm gonna go now.
Don't remember my face.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.181
Forget this face.
This didn't happen.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.016
What is wrong
with the name Paul, okay?

14:12.018 --> 14:13.952
Paul is a normal name.
He is a normal guy.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.019
That<i> is</i> the problem, okay?

14:15.021 --> 14:17.121
You shouldn't be
with a normal guy.

14:19.291 --> 14:20.625
All right, okay.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.294
It was Mark-Paul Gosselaar.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.531
What? You... you were...
you were with Zack Morris?

14:26.533 --> 14:29.200
Mm-hmm.
- Guy's a frigging god.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.237
I mean, all right.
I've... I surrender.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.739
That's awes... Can
I come to the wedding?

14:34.741 --> 14:37.141
(laughs)
- You think Slater and
Screech are gonna be there?

14:37.143 --> 14:40.245
(laughing):
I'm kidding. I just wanted
to see you freak out.
- (sighs)

14:40.247 --> 14:42.547
You really had me going
there for a second.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.349
(laughing)
It works every time with you.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.084
It's amazing. Now...

14:46.086 --> 14:49.354
There was a real second there
where I had bad feelings

14:49.356 --> 14:50.922
towards Mark-Paul Gosselaar,

14:50.924 --> 14:53.324
and I didn't like
any moment of that.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.361
How dare you. Don't ever
do that to me again.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.695
When I was nine years old,

14:57.697 --> 15:00.098
I fed cereal flakes
to a frog, and it died.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.367
Then I went
into a period of time

15:02.369 --> 15:04.369
where I fed cereal flakes
to all little animals.

15:04.371 --> 15:07.372
Squirrels can live through it,
chipmunks can live through it.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.173
Anything that lives
half in and out of water dies,

15:09.175 --> 15:11.009
and I don't understand why.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.378
When I was ten, I once walked
by my mother sleeping,

15:13.380 --> 15:15.914
and I snuck in the room,
and I put a lemon in her mouth.

15:15.916 --> 15:19.584
When I was 11, I once tried on
my girl cousin's wool tights,

15:19.586 --> 15:21.920
and I didn't hate
the way it felt!

15:21.922 --> 15:23.388
Why are you telling me this?

15:23.390 --> 15:24.923
Because you said you wanted
to hear everything!

15:24.925 --> 15:27.191
My sixteenth year,
I never got an erection.

15:27.193 --> 15:29.127
I thought they were done.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.195
I thought my penis was dead.

15:31.197 --> 15:32.764
It wasn't.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.399
It's fine, Winston.
We can fix this.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.200
Just help me mule this crank.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.802
I'll prepare, you mule.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.537
I can't mule crank.
I don't have the system.

15:39.539 --> 15:43.141
It's the perfect plan.
I don't think it is.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.776
Jess, do you know how
much time we could get

15:44.778 --> 15:46.978
for possessing this much meth?
Why'd you hide it from me?

15:46.980 --> 15:49.414
I was trying to protect you.
I should've been the
first person you told!

15:49.416 --> 15:51.215
I could've taken care
of it, or something.

15:51.217 --> 15:53.418
Now it just looks like
we're hiding it.
- I just...

15:53.420 --> 15:55.820
I didn't... I didn't think
there was anything you could do.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.289
And-and why is that?

15:59.224 --> 16:02.327
Because... I don't know!

16:02.329 --> 16:04.762
Because you don't see me
as a cop. None of you do.

16:04.764 --> 16:09.167
I didn't... I didn't think
you'd make it this far.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.002
We always thought
you'd change your mind.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.403
I mean...

16:12.405 --> 16:15.239
you say a prayer every time
you get on a escalator.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.008
Why risk it?
- I just...

16:17.010 --> 16:21.813
never really saw you
as a... as a cop.

16:21.815 --> 16:24.248
Sorry.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.517
Oh, there it is.

16:30.789 --> 16:32.457
Okay. Okay.

16:32.459 --> 16:35.193
You know what? I know
exactly what I have to do.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.662
I'm gonna tell
her it's mine.
- What?! No. No.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.665
Yes. Maybe I'm not
supposed to be a cop.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.234
There's no reason
you should lose your job, too.

16:45.437 --> 16:47.672
I once changed a sign that said
"Happy Jewish New Year"

16:47.674 --> 16:49.474
to "Happy Newish Jew Year."

16:49.476 --> 16:51.876
Is that a hate crime?
Stop talking, stop sweating.

16:51.878 --> 16:54.879
What is wrong
with you people?! Enough!

16:54.881 --> 16:56.681
Sarge, I have something
I need to tell you.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.683
Wait! Sergeant!

16:58.685 --> 17:00.051
My name is Jessica Day,

17:00.053 --> 17:03.121
and this is my meth.
- DORADO:
What?!

17:03.123 --> 17:05.056
Jess, No. I won't
accept that. So...

17:05.058 --> 17:07.358
The bathroom is covered in meth.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.495
Meth that belongs to me.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.797
And it may have
intoxicated me

17:12.799 --> 17:15.900
through the skin
on my breasts.

17:15.902 --> 17:19.070
But I assure you,
no one here had

17:19.072 --> 17:21.706
any prior knowledge
of any of this.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.474
Especially Winston.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.911
And I don't want him
to go down for my mistake.

17:26.913 --> 17:30.048
You'd be lucky
to have him as a cop.

17:30.050 --> 17:34.786
Take me downtown
to the all-lady fur factory.

17:35.487 --> 17:38.256
Okay, cuff me.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.058
Somebody bring me handcuffs.
I'm guilty.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.692
Is she cuffing me?

17:41.694 --> 17:43.094
I can't see
what's going on up there.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.529
Do you feel anything?

17:44.531 --> 17:46.330
Does meth make you feel,
like, normal,

17:46.332 --> 17:50.101
but, like... like
your face feels, like, scratchy?

17:50.103 --> 17:53.237
Oh, no, that's just
the carpet on my face.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.342
Here's the way this
is gonna go down.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.178
I'm gonna go in the bathroom,
have a look around.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.345
You will stay here.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.347
You will not move,

18:03.349 --> 18:05.083
you will not talk,

18:05.085 --> 18:06.350
you will not think

18:06.352 --> 18:10.188
unless they're thoughts
about not moving.

18:13.358 --> 18:15.760
Winston, I'm so sorry.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.361
I ruined everything.

18:17.363 --> 18:19.697
You would have been
such a good cop.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.566
You would have made
someone really lucky

18:21.568 --> 18:23.134
to have you
as a partner.

18:23.136 --> 18:26.137
I always imagined I'd have
a partner named Robertson.

18:26.139 --> 18:28.106
That would have
been perfect.
- Yeah.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.640
"Robertson, you're
on the edge!

18:29.642 --> 18:31.542
You've gone too far!"
- No, no, no.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.578
See, the thing about me and
Robertson is that we're tight.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.279
You know, then I went ahead
and slept with his wife.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.747
Why would you do that?
I don't know why...

18:36.749 --> 18:38.316
I don't know why
I would do that.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.550
The job really gets to you.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.786
You know,
it's stressful out there.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.588
This might not be
the right moment but...

18:43.590 --> 18:46.390
for what it's worth,
I did it.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.126
I kept a secret.
SCHMIDT:
Well, congratulations, Nick.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.561
You have the willpower
of a six-year-old.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.463
Oh, thank you.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.565
I'm sorry about the
whole kissing thing.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.501
Oh, you don't have to apologize.

18:56.503 --> 19:00.771
I did... kiss you back a little.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.941
So, should we tell
Paul together?

19:03.943 --> 19:06.177
Oh.
- Well, what do you think
he's doing right now?

19:06.179 --> 19:07.612
Do you think he's
explaining to the air-brusher

19:07.614 --> 19:09.147
that that really
is his name? Paul?

19:09.149 --> 19:10.615
And that he wants
that painted

19:10.617 --> 19:12.416
across the back of
his denim jacket?

19:12.418 --> 19:13.951
It's a normal name.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.354
(whispering):
Hey, Nick?

19:16.356 --> 19:21.592
When I'm in prison,
write, dance, sing...

19:21.594 --> 19:24.428
live your life.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.164
And if you come
and visit me in jail,

19:26.166 --> 19:28.366
please don't wear that robe.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.634
It's a kimono.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.702
Well, this is a first.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.605
These are aquarium rocks.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.207
So, that's
the street name for...

19:36.209 --> 19:38.509
No. These are actual
aquarium rocks.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.045
You were trying to flush rocks
down your toilet.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.380
Oh, what?!
- Oh.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.648
Oh, that's ridiculous.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.983
That's great!
Yes! Awesome!

19:45.985 --> 19:47.051
So we're not
going to prison?

19:47.053 --> 19:48.286
(Cece laughing)

19:48.288 --> 19:49.453
So, did Winston pass
the background check?

19:49.455 --> 19:52.089
Of course.
He's one of our best cadets.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.328
His test scores are high,
he's passionate, hardworking.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.297
He's gonna make
one hell of a cop.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.233
But he won't work in narcotics.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.801
You get to be a cop!

20:03.803 --> 20:05.036
Yay!

20:05.038 --> 20:06.304
(all chatting happily)

20:06.306 --> 20:07.672
Congrat... congrat...
Congratulate...

20:07.674 --> 20:09.640
Really? No, we're
celebrating Winston.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.676
Celebrating Winston. Okay.
All right, we'll
celebrate Winston.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.411
Oh.
- Yeah.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.680
Excuse me.
Please consider moving.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.814
I have no idea

20:16.816 --> 20:18.883
why you live with these people.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.686
What kind of person would
urinate on an electrical socket?

20:21.688 --> 20:24.488
I... I thought
it would make lightning.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.324
I told you that wouldn't
work, Nick.
- COACH:
Hey!

20:26.326 --> 20:29.560
Guess who's here like he
normally is every Saturday!

20:29.562 --> 20:32.096
It's Duquan!

20:32.098 --> 20:33.431
Big brother Wimstons.

20:34.266 --> 20:36.100
Oh.

20:36.102 --> 20:38.069
I love you, Mr. Wimstons.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.705
I go from no hope to hope.

20:40.707 --> 20:44.342
He take me and he says to me,
"You're gonna be somebody.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.510
"You-You could be
the presidents,

20:46.512 --> 20:48.512
or Statues of Liberties."

20:48.514 --> 20:50.581
Is that right?
- We make homework togethers.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.351
He buys me toys,
and we chase each others,

20:53.353 --> 20:55.286
and we laugh at the sun.

21:01.293 --> 21:02.293
This feels good, man.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.294
Yeah.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.295
Like I got a new friend.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.230
Me, too.
- Duquan.

21:06.232 --> 21:07.932
Right.
- Hanging out.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.433
It's Jose, so...

21:09.435 --> 21:11.736
Yeah, I like
Duquan, though.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.471
Yeah, but my name's Jose.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.739
Like outlet malls?

21:14.741 --> 21:16.374
I love outlet malls.
Ah, me, too, man.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.541
Yeah.
Yeah. That's awesome.

21:17.543 --> 21:18.943
On the weekend, though? Mm.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.911
Yeah, but I mean, I have
a strategy, you know.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.146
Like, I start out
with a smoothie,

21:22.148 --> 21:23.481
and then do my leg stores first.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.816
Then, I... Yeah.
- I do the same,
but I end it with pretzel.

21:25.818 --> 21:26.751
Pretzel. I...
- Shut up.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.653
Cinnamon pretzel?
- Oh, my God.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.421
Dude, don't, don't, don't.
No, you don't.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.923
No, you don't. You want
to play a tickle game?

21:32.925 --> 21:35.960
