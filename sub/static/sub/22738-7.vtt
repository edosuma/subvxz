WEBVTT

00:26.060 --> 00:29.230
You're really going to town with
the moisturizer there, buddy.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.698
I don't follow.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.633
I'm-I'm just talking
about, you know,

00:32.666 --> 00:36.170
an activity...
with your penis.

00:36.204 --> 00:39.107
What does moisturizer have to do
with masturbation anyways?

00:39.140 --> 00:40.741
Seriously?

00:40.774 --> 00:43.077
As a teenaged Tolbeck,
you never had a little...

00:43.111 --> 00:45.279
moisturizer in
the nightstand?

00:45.313 --> 00:46.747
No. Never.
Never?

00:46.780 --> 00:47.748
Mm-mm.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.251
Hmm. Well,

00:50.284 --> 00:52.686
my dad used to have moisturizer
on his nightstand,

00:52.720 --> 00:55.123
and, uh, it was just
because he had dry skin.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.125
Mm, I don't think
that's why.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.293
Yes, it is,
and it's hereditary.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.529
Yeah, it is hereditary.
He was a masturbator,

01:01.562 --> 01:04.665
like-like his father before
him, like his son after.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.467
You know something, Cullen?

01:06.500 --> 01:08.636
You have not been
very nice lately.

01:08.669 --> 01:11.439
And actually,
I keep a journal.

01:11.472 --> 01:14.375
Every day, when I go home from
work, I write in my journal,

01:14.408 --> 01:16.410
and the past four days,
you know what I've written?

01:16.444 --> 01:18.246
"Cullen wasn't very nice
to me today."

01:18.279 --> 01:20.248
That's really weird,

01:20.281 --> 01:22.116
'cause in my journal,
I've been writing,

01:22.150 --> 01:24.518
"I was really nice at
work to Tolbeck today."

01:24.552 --> 01:26.520
Wow, you keep a journal, too?
No, I'm joking.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.589
Because journals are for
tweens and serial killers.

01:31.292 --> 01:36.330
"Cullen wasn't very nice
to me today, again."

01:40.901 --> 01:43.271
You know, you're right.

01:43.304 --> 01:46.274
You're right.
I've been kind of a jerk.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.543
I, uh, talked
about splitting up

01:49.577 --> 01:51.712
and finding new
partners, and

01:51.745 --> 01:53.281
I shouldn't have said
all that stuff to you.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.648
I'm sorry about that.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.750
It's okay.
I knew you weren't serious.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.387
No, I was serious about it,
but I think all the stuff about

01:59.420 --> 02:01.222
Fatima, you know,
not kind of working out

02:01.255 --> 02:03.257
and me feeling
professionally stagnated,

02:03.291 --> 02:04.925
uh, I took that
out on you.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.894
It's not your fault,
and I'm sorry, okay?

02:06.927 --> 02:08.529
That's what I'm trying
to say. I'm sorry.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.332
I'm... I'm sorry.

02:11.365 --> 02:14.302
So... what?
You don't want a new partner?

02:14.335 --> 02:17.371
Look, if Agent Haldeman
called me and was like,

02:17.405 --> 02:18.872
"Hey, buddy, I've been
reading your reports,

02:18.906 --> 02:21.475
"and, uh, I think I like
the cut of your jib,

02:21.509 --> 02:23.744
and you and I could form a
special task force where..."
Okay.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.813
Let me, let me stop you
right there, okay, Cullen?
Yeah.

02:25.846 --> 02:29.683
I can accept Agent Haldeman
being your fantasy partner

02:29.717 --> 02:32.553
or whatever, but, like,
when you say it out loud,

02:32.586 --> 02:34.788
it doesn't make me feel
all warm and fuzzy.

02:34.822 --> 02:35.789
I know.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.525
I'm sorry.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.193
I won't do it again.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.728
I value you.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.330
Okay?
Hey, you know what?

02:42.363 --> 02:43.731
You look a little dry there.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.733
How about a little bit?
There you go.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.668
No. Wait. Stay here.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.239
You got to get it in good.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.840
There we go.

02:52.873 --> 02:56.944
Well, you have more hair
on your hand than I expected.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.780
* Taking a dry hand
and making it moist *

02:59.813 --> 03:02.516
* Taking a dry hand and
making it moist. *

03:02.550 --> 03:04.618
That's enough.
What?

03:04.652 --> 03:08.356
Maybe it was the song,
but that's enough. For now?

03:08.389 --> 03:10.558
Okay, I won't sing the song.
Come on, give it back.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.660
Okay.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.465
I'm thinking of
the words now.

03:18.766 --> 03:21.001
* And moist

03:21.034 --> 03:23.671
BOTH: * Taking a dry hand
and making it moist *

03:23.704 --> 03:25.439
Mm-hmm.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.708
* Taking a dry hand
and making it moist *

03:27.741 --> 03:30.611
* Boink, boink, boink.
boink, boink. *
Okay.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.781
("Happiness, Missouri"
by El Vy playing)

03:33.814 --> 03:37.651
* While away while
someone counts the minutes *

03:37.685 --> 03:41.955
* Happiness, Missouri,
I got to get your mind off *

03:41.989 --> 03:45.693
* By the way,
I told you we were in this *

03:45.726 --> 03:49.663
* Happiness, Missouri,
I got to get your mind off it. *

03:49.697 --> 03:52.300
*

04:09.683 --> 04:11.652
MAN : DEA is
about to take full control

04:11.685 --> 04:13.387
of this warehouse surveillance.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.489
Uh, they probably want
to see that body pulled

04:15.523 --> 04:17.591
from the Otay Mesa Reservoir
a few miles away.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.893
MAN 2 :
Copy that.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.895
Have they identified
that body yet?

04:21.929 --> 04:25.533
MAN: Not yet.
We should know later today.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.746
So, this is it?

04:38.779 --> 04:40.714
You're just gonna...

04:40.748 --> 04:43.016
sulk and give me
the cold shoulder?

04:43.050 --> 04:45.453
You wanted me
to kill him.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.720
No, I fucking didn't, Marco!

04:46.754 --> 04:48.021
Yes, you did.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.557
You looked right at me,
and you said,

04:49.590 --> 04:50.691
"Marco, please kill him.
Please."

04:50.724 --> 04:53.394
I said, "Marco,
he's killing me."

04:53.427 --> 04:55.496
There's a big fucking
difference there.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.897
Oh, that is such bullshit.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.899
You looked right into my eyes,

04:58.932 --> 05:00.901
and you said something about
killing, and I said, "Really?"

05:00.934 --> 05:03.771
And then you said,
"Yeah," and you nodded.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.573
Yeah, I said,
"He's killing me."
Then I nodded.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.607
You nodded.
Sure.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.776
I looked away.
Same.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.778
My head might've moved,
but I didn't give you a nod.
Nod.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.546
Which is a nod. That's a nod.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.947
No, it's a turn.
Oh, Angus...

05:13.981 --> 05:15.783
That's fucking different
than a nod.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.851
Do you know how much effort
it took for me to kill that guy?

05:17.885 --> 05:19.853
It is hard to kill
someone that size.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.789
He is very strong,
he was surprisingly agile.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.391
I'm so sorry, man.
He bit me.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.125
He bit me. He broke the skin.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.694
Yeah, because you were trying
to fucking kill him!

05:26.727 --> 05:28.095
Yes, I was trying to kill him!
I would bite you, too!

05:28.128 --> 05:30.330
For you! For you!

05:34.868 --> 05:37.671
FATIMA: So, the other day,
I was sitting

05:37.705 --> 05:40.541
by the pier with my friend.
We were just hanging out.

05:40.574 --> 05:44.845
And there's one of these, like,
annoying drones nearby. Stupid.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.648
So, we start talking
about how annoying

05:47.681 --> 05:50.484
and stupid
and useless they are.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.986
So, cut to... the next day.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.655
Okay.
I'm walking in the park.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.657
Mm-hmm.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.460
And this hits me
in the head.

05:59.493 --> 06:02.162
This... hits me in the head.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.064
Out of nowhere.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.400
My phone was listening
to me talk about drones,

06:06.434 --> 06:08.736
and then this drone hit me
in the head.
Okay.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.037
Well, that's a terrific story.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.905
I'd say,
A) You need some action verbs,

06:11.939 --> 06:14.107
and B) It's just a coincidence.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.743
No, no, no,
it's not a coincidence.

06:15.776 --> 06:16.910
It was listening.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.846
Your phone was listening?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.848
Yeah, they're always listening.
Yeah, let me show you.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.016
This-this footage is...
Hey, do you have that app

06:23.050 --> 06:24.785
where you can put bunny ears
on yourself?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.587
I think it's really funny.
No, wa-watch, watch.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.988
Watch, watch, okay?

06:28.021 --> 06:29.690
This is from the drone.

06:29.723 --> 06:30.958
I took the footage
from the drone.
All right.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.926
See? Now it looks,
searching for something.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.095
Right? It's like
a target, and then...

06:36.664 --> 06:38.131
No, no, wait.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.534
No, you're missing the point.
Give me that.

06:42.870 --> 06:43.837
No.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.607
You got to send me this.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.175
You got to send...

06:57.818 --> 06:59.152
MIGUEL: No, no, no,
it's great that you're back.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.488
You were just so excited about

07:00.521 --> 07:02.490
joining that big fancy tunnel.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.957
So-so what was
the problem again?

07:03.991 --> 07:05.793
I don't know.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.695
It just didn't feel right to me.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.029
Yeah, sure. Sure.
Yeah.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.564
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.133
The super tunnel
was too... too flashy.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.103
There was no soul; they were
just churning out the work.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.071
Nobody cared.
Right.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.740
But I thought
that's what you wanted, though.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.174
You know, the super drug tunnel.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.943
You know,
it was good for your narrative.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.578
I thought
that's what I understood.

07:24.612 --> 07:25.979
Yeah, I thought that.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.581
And maybe it's good for me
in the short-term,

07:27.615 --> 07:28.949
but as a comedian,
I have to think about

07:28.982 --> 07:31.218
the long
Yeah.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.954
The tunnel was too broad.
Like, literally broad?

07:33.987 --> 07:35.556
Like, it was, it was too wide?
Yeah.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.558
This is the shit
I want to be known for.

07:37.591 --> 07:38.759
All right.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.494
Let's... let's get to it, huh?

07:40.528 --> 07:42.195
Go ahead. I have a migraine.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.998
Welcome back.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.240
ANGUS:
You don't get it, man.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.808
You don't get it.
He was my stepdad.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.276
All right?
He was a piece of shit.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.878
He wasn't a piece of shit.
He was barely your stepdad.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.947
He was a little annoying.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.550
But he said, he said
he'd take a bullet for me.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.752
Okay?

08:04.785 --> 08:06.954
Yeah, right.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.556
Yeah, right what? He said that.
A guy like that.

08:08.589 --> 08:09.923
A guy you've known
five minutes says

08:09.957 --> 08:11.158
he'd take a bullet
for you? Right.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.726
You think he meant it?

08:12.760 --> 08:13.994
How does that even come up?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.863
How does that even
come up, Angus?!

08:15.896 --> 08:17.064
No one's ever said that
to me before.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.699
I'm sorry it affected me.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.001
I'm sorry, uh... you know...

08:21.034 --> 08:23.003
Okay, so I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that I-I killed the guy

08:23.036 --> 08:24.938
that you knew
for five minutes,

08:24.972 --> 08:26.206
who said he'd take
a bullet for you.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.108
And that that meant
something to you.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.843
And meanwhile, I've known you
for fucking years, and what?

08:29.877 --> 08:32.112
You want me to say it?
Is that what you want?

08:32.145 --> 08:34.615
Is that what you're asking?
I'll say it.
No. No.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.717
I-I don't want you to say it.
If you need to hear those words,

08:36.750 --> 08:38.886
if those words are comfort to
you, I'll say those words.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.054
I don't want you
to say it, man.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.856
Fine.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.861
I would take a
bullet for you.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.299
Thanks, man.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.936
Hang on.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.740
Actually, I did take
a bullet for you.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.575
When did you take
a bullet for me?

09:01.609 --> 09:04.177
The ear?
Yeah.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.114
I did, in practice, that
which he said he would do.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.116
I doubt your ear
even stopped the bullet.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.819
Had I been standing behind you,
I would've been hit.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.021
Forget it. This is stupid.
You know what, you're right.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.155
I-I'm sorry.
This is all my bad.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.825
I-I shouldn't have killed
your stepfather.
Yeah.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.993
No.
Yeah. Don't
worry about it.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.695
Why don't you write
his suicide note to your mom?

09:21.729 --> 09:22.896
That's-that's probably
the most important thing.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.464
Who cares?
Okay, yeah,
that's-that's what I'll do,

09:24.497 --> 09:26.900
because I have to do that now,
because you fucking killed him.
Yeah. Great.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.368
And I'll just sit here
and think about how his eyes

09:28.401 --> 09:30.838
popped out of his head
as I was strangling him.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.973
And his last words
were, "Fuck Angus."

09:43.250 --> 09:44.652
Oh, no.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.221
Oh, no.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.890
What What

09:49.923 --> 09:52.660
What's happened?
You okay?

09:52.693 --> 09:54.227
I did something bad.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.963
Really, really bad.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.998
Okay.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.701
Okay, it's all right.
Hey, Tolbeck, look at me.

10:00.734 --> 10:03.070
Okay? Whatever you've done,
okay, I'm your partner.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.705
We can get through this
together, all right?

10:04.738 --> 10:06.640
It's about Kyle.

10:06.674 --> 10:08.408
Kyle?
Yeah.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.144
Okay. I've hated Kyle
ever since you told me

10:11.178 --> 10:13.313
about this bullshit
open marriage situation.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.948
All right?

10:14.982 --> 10:17.217
Just tell me.
What's happened?

10:17.250 --> 10:19.419
Well, yesterday
when I went home,

10:19.452 --> 10:22.422
um, I got to the house,
and I walk in,

10:22.455 --> 10:25.759
and I see Kyle in the kitchen
standing over the kitchen sink.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.028
Right.
And he's drinking
coconut water.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.697
Uh-huh.
My coconut water.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.733
Right. Yeah.
Right out of the carton.

10:32.766 --> 10:36.003
He's sweaty, like he'd just done
some kind of athletic thing.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.038
Standing there
in his, like, T-shirt

10:38.071 --> 10:40.240
with no underpants on.
Shirt-dicking.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.375
What?
That's called shirt-dicking.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.377
T-shirt, no pants.
That's shirt-dicking.
Okay.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.947
Well, he was shirt-dicking
in my kitchen.
Right.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.249
And, so he's all sweaty,
and, you know,

10:49.282 --> 10:51.251
he's got the coconut water
all over his beard.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.053
And then he... he looks at me,

10:53.086 --> 10:55.122
and I look at him.
Hmm.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.324
And we stare at each other
for a second.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.127
And then he goes,
"Hey, man, what's up?"

11:00.160 --> 11:02.295
Oh, no, he didn't.
Yeah.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.898
And then he walks past me
right into the bedroom.

11:04.932 --> 11:07.300
So, I walk towards
the bedroom and I say,

11:07.334 --> 11:09.803
"No, I'm gonna sit down,
and I'm gonna chill.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.004
I'm gonna watch a little TV."

11:11.038 --> 11:13.273
So I go into the den...
Mm.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.242
and there's Dennis.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.476
Dennis?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.445
Yeah, Kyle's dog.

11:18.478 --> 11:21.381
This big Irish wolfhound.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.350
Molting all over my couch.
Right.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.052
And I'm like, "That's it."

11:25.085 --> 11:27.154
Yeah.
So I-I take Dennis.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.388
Yeah.
I open the door.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.422
Right.
Push him out.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.991
Right.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.425
And I gave him a little kick.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.027
Yeah?

11:34.061 --> 11:35.996
Yeah.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.167
That's it?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.835
Yeah.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.436
That's it?
Jesus Christ, Tolbeck,

11:43.470 --> 11:46.039
I thought you'd fucking
killed Kyle or something.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.776
Who gives a fuck if
you kick the dog out?

11:48.809 --> 11:50.343
There's more.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.412
Oh, there is more?
Okay. Oh, okay. Go.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.748
I just got a text
from Kyle.
Right.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.483
Dennis is missing.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.888
And that is it, is it?
That's it.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.823
That's it.
Oh, fuck me. Tolbeck.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.491
I mean, what have I become?

12:04.524 --> 12:07.227
A dog kicker?
That's not me.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.997
Kyle is fucking
your wife, Tolbeck.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.865
Do you understand?
He is having

12:11.899 --> 12:15.168
penetrative sex with Lisa. Okay?

12:15.202 --> 12:17.370
So if you'd killed both of them,
I would've thought, "Yeah.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.438
"That's fair. He's
killed them both.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.974
Let's get rid of them
somewhere around here."

12:21.008 --> 12:24.144
Anyways, can you help me
find Dennis

12:24.177 --> 12:25.779
when our shift is over?
No.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.080
Please.
No.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.882
Absolutely not.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.018
As your friend-- as
maybe your best friend--

12:31.051 --> 12:33.486
I am not gonna help you
find fucking Dennis.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.957
And bear in mind, I was ready
to help you bury two bodies.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.525
Why are you so angry?

12:38.558 --> 12:40.193
'Cause one of us
has to be angry!

12:40.227 --> 12:42.195
Okay? One of us has
to be angry, Tolbeck.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.164
It's... This is
appropriate anger.

12:44.197 --> 12:47.367
This is an appropriate
response to that situation.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.369
Okay? And, yeah, I will
help you find Dennis.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.905
And when we find him, I'm
gonna kick him in the head.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.974
Yeah. I'm gonna kick him
in the fucking head.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.775
Till he's dead.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.315
"Roberto had another
fanciful thought.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.852
"He had a powerful
imagination,

13:04.885 --> 13:08.021
"and it often provided him
with whimsical escapes

13:08.055 --> 13:10.290
"from dreary tunnel life.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.960
"His muscles bulged
with expectation.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.361
"Ostensibly, this tunnel

13:14.394 --> 13:16.296
"was his path
to fame and fortune.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.531
"But, perhaps
even more ostensibly,

13:18.565 --> 13:21.869
it was merely a tunnel."

13:21.902 --> 13:23.370
Chapter 48.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.574
Thoughts?

13:27.607 --> 13:29.476
If I may?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.178
Please.
Yeah.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.980
Okay, for example,
this, uh, this word, um...

13:33.013 --> 13:35.382
"osense-osensibly."

13:35.415 --> 13:36.549
"Ose-Os..."
Ostensibly.

13:36.583 --> 13:37.985
Oh, that's the one.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.020
Yeah.
Man, you use that word a lot.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.355
It's my favorite English word.
I could tell.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.991
I could tell.
But is it too much?

13:44.024 --> 13:44.992
Do you use it too much?

13:45.025 --> 13:46.093
Mm. Mm.
No?

13:46.126 --> 13:47.227
It's a cool-sounding word.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.495
Sure, but what does it mean?

13:48.528 --> 13:50.864
What does that word mean?
It means

13:50.898 --> 13:52.299
something could be something,

13:52.332 --> 13:55.435
or something
could not be something.

13:55.468 --> 13:59.006
You could basically say that
about everything.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.008
Or anything
in the world, really.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.943
Ostensibly.

14:02.976 --> 14:06.613
MAN: Turns out John Doe was
Adrian Colbert, 52 years old.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.481
I recovered some receipts
from him.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.017
Seems our boy liked tacos.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.251
ANGUS:
Okay.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.121
How this?

14:14.154 --> 14:17.524
"Dear Vanessa,
I know this looks bad,

14:17.557 --> 14:21.194
"but honestly
it's the best result for you.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.163
"So don't be sad.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.497
"Live your life.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.001
"Just stop having
boyfriends for a while.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.370
"Your son is awesome,

14:30.403 --> 14:33.073
"and maybe he's the only man
you need in your life. Anyway...

14:33.106 --> 14:35.075
Sincerely, Adrian."

14:35.108 --> 14:37.144
Yeah, no, I think
there's, uh...

14:37.177 --> 14:39.046
Be honest.
There's some good
stuff in there,

14:39.079 --> 14:40.680
for sure, but...

14:40.713 --> 14:42.349
I don't know,
maybe in a little while,

14:42.382 --> 14:44.417
take a look at it
with some fresh eyes

14:44.451 --> 14:45.585
and maybe take
another pass at it.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.287
Yeah, this is, uh,
a first draft.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.322
Yeah, I don't know.

14:49.356 --> 14:52.459
I'm supposed to air this out.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.594
Oh, shit.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.029
What was that?

14:57.564 --> 14:59.599
Hey. Hey, Angus.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.568
How

15:01.601 --> 15:04.437
It looks, it looks pretty good.
Yeah?

15:04.471 --> 15:05.538
Okay, 'cause you jumped up...
I mean, it's a little bit bigger

15:05.572 --> 15:07.440
than your other ear.
You jumped up right when you...

15:07.474 --> 15:10.043
And now you're going over here.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.644
Which makes me think maybe
you don't want to look at it.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.080
You're not even really looking
at it. Does it...?

15:13.113 --> 15:14.481
I looked at it, man.
Angus, does it look...

15:14.514 --> 15:15.983
Does the ear look normal?
Yeah. Yeah.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.384
Does it look like this one?

15:17.417 --> 15:20.087
I mean, yeah, if
you look closely.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.023
I mean, it's... Like I said,
it's a little bit b-bigger.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.125
And it's obviously--
I don't know
It's bigger?

15:25.158 --> 15:27.027
if it's just infected
or something, but...
What do you mean, it's bigger?

15:27.060 --> 15:29.196
it seems like it's...
Oh, shit.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.697
You're right, it's bigger.
It's, like...

15:30.730 --> 15:32.732
it's, like, bigger.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.735
Oh, goddamn it,
this guy really fucked me.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.903
What, the surgeon?

15:39.572 --> 15:42.442
I couldn't exactly go
to a doctor and have this done.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.277
There'd be a lot of questions,
you know?

15:44.311 --> 15:47.214
So I went down
to Tijuana to do it.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.249
I knew I should've just spent
a little bit more money on this.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.683
This was so stupid.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.419
But I love a bargain, you know?

15:52.452 --> 15:55.122
Yeah, I know.
And he was like, "Come down.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.656
"We won't even use anesthetic.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.426
We'll just get drunk
at the bar." Which we did.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.761
And then went back
to the clinic.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.131
Open up a fridge,
and the kid's got, like...

16:04.164 --> 16:05.732
drawer full of ears,
you know?

16:05.765 --> 16:08.435
A drawer full of ears?
Yeah.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.302
They got a drawer
full of fingers,

16:09.336 --> 16:10.637
drawer full of nipples,

16:10.670 --> 16:11.938
drawer full of ears.
They got everything.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.707
You know when you...
A drawer full of ears,
fingers and nipples?

16:14.741 --> 16:16.376
Different drawers.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.677
I don't think you can mix them.

16:17.710 --> 16:21.014
So, this box
full of, uh, ears...
Yeah.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.449
You looked in there,

16:22.482 --> 16:25.318
and they were all
definitely human ears?

16:25.352 --> 16:27.487
What the fuck does that mean?

16:27.520 --> 16:30.157
Uh, it looks...

16:30.190 --> 16:31.658
Be honest. Be honest with me.

16:31.691 --> 16:32.825
I'm trying to be honest.
If you let me speak...

16:32.859 --> 16:34.661
Be honest with me!
It looks a little
like a pig ear.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.529
What?!
Yeah.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.298
What do you mean,
it looks like a pig's ear?

16:38.331 --> 16:39.632
Uh, I-I mean...

16:39.666 --> 16:41.568
No.
It looks like an ear

16:41.601 --> 16:43.270
that would be attached
to a pig.
Is it pointy? Is it... Wait.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.472
Yeah. I mean, I'm sorry

16:45.505 --> 16:47.174
to br-break this
to you, man, but...

16:47.207 --> 16:48.641
Are you telling me this looks

16:48.675 --> 16:50.377
like a fucking pig's ear
on my head?

16:50.410 --> 16:51.511
You could get another one

16:51.544 --> 16:54.481
and become
Pig Ear Marco.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.183
Your advice
is get a second pig ear?
Come up behind someone...

17:01.454 --> 17:03.390
You know what?
You're a fucking dick.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.458
You're a dick,
and your suicide note was shit.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.727
Your mom is grieving,

17:07.760 --> 17:10.363
and you're writing her
a fucking love letter?

17:10.397 --> 17:11.698
All about
how awesome you are

17:11.731 --> 17:13.666
and how she doesn't need
any more boyfriends

17:13.700 --> 17:15.835
'cause she's got her son?
That was one sentence, man.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.138
Like, read into that, man.
That was your first pass?

17:18.171 --> 17:20.307
It was a pass at your mom.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.346
Fuck you!

17:34.321 --> 17:36.256
Look, I'm sorry about before.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.691
I didn't mean
to get so worked up. I just...

17:38.725 --> 17:41.494
Lisa wants to have an
open marriage, okay?

17:41.528 --> 17:43.596
How about we make it
really open?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.732
You know what I mean?
For all parties involved.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.367
I don't know.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.768
Kyle's a one-woman man, so...

17:48.801 --> 17:50.603
No, no, no, I mean...
I'm talking about you.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.605
You should see other
pe... You should...
Oh.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.141
Why are you so
obsessed with Kyle?

17:54.174 --> 17:56.176
Kyle is very talented.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.211
He's actually
building his own yurt.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.446
Nobody cares about a yurt.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.515
What is a fucking yurt? It's
a bullshit structure, okay?

18:02.549 --> 18:04.751
Hero cop is the thing
that women want.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.619
Hero cop, okay?

18:06.653 --> 18:08.388
Okay.
And when we make
this drug bust,

18:08.421 --> 18:09.589
Yeah.
we may even get a medal.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.391
No way.
Yeah, a medal.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.260
A big shiny medal.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.761
I've never gotten
a medal before.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.729
Well, you better
get ready to get one.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.665
'Cause it's gonna match
your big, shiny dick.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.300
What?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.435
And when that happens,
a dozen Kyles

18:22.469 --> 18:24.204
won't stack up to you.
You know why?
Why?

18:24.237 --> 18:25.572
'Cause you're the cop.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.240
You're the hero cop.
Stop it.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.541
Okay? You know what
I'm talking about?
Right.

18:28.575 --> 18:29.542
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

18:29.576 --> 18:31.278
I do. Stop tickling me.
Okay.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.180
You're-you're
the big dog.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.714
You're the big dog here,
okay, on this hunt, all right?

18:34.747 --> 18:36.583
All right. All right.
And there's no dog

18:36.616 --> 18:38.551
in San Diego as
big as this dog.
Okay.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.887
So let me hear you bark, dog.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.289
Arf.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.724
Let me hear you bark, dog.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.693
Arf! Arf!
No. No.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.162
Release the belly.
Let me hear you bark.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.530
Woof! Woof!
That's what I'm
talking about.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.764
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Yeah.

18:51.798 --> 18:52.865
JANICE:
Car 27, please report.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.601
Car 27.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.569
CULLEN: Car 27, no activity.

18:56.603 --> 18:57.570
Copy that.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.607
Hey, um, Janice?

19:00.640 --> 19:04.511
I've been meaning to talk to you
about this actually, um...

19:04.544 --> 19:07.447
Well, I don't think
I'm gonna be here much longer.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.249
It's just...

19:09.282 --> 19:12.385
I, uh, well,
I got offered a spot

19:12.419 --> 19:14.954
in, um, over in 911.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.690
And, um,

19:17.724 --> 19:20.593
I only just found out today,
actually,

19:20.627 --> 19:22.529
but I'm-I'm gonna take it.

19:22.562 --> 19:25.265
And just...
You're leaving dispatch?

19:25.298 --> 19:28.201
Yeah. I think
it's gonna be more...

19:28.235 --> 19:30.703
um, you know, more...

19:30.737 --> 19:32.539
More what?

19:32.572 --> 19:34.207
Uh, more exciting.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.209
Oh. Well, I'm sorry

19:36.243 --> 19:38.345
that being a major part
of a huge drug bust

19:38.378 --> 19:39.746
isn't exciting
enough for you.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.349
Well, that's the thing.
It sounds exciting,

19:42.382 --> 19:44.917
but nothing ever happens.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.886
Actually, that's not true.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.722
On the first night, Tolbeck shot
someone, and I thought, "Great.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.824
"This is gonna be fun,
you know.
Uh-huh.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.227
Stuff like this is gonna
happen all the time."

19:54.261 --> 19:57.297
But we just s-sit here.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.799
And nothing happens,
night after night.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.435
Here's some advice, and I'm not
even gonna charge you for it:

20:02.469 --> 20:04.604
You're making a huge
mistake, all right?

20:04.637 --> 20:06.573
I know. I worked in 911.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.475
You're making a mistake.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.377
It's not personal.
Mm.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.811
If it wasn't personal,
I wouldn't be feeling

20:11.844 --> 20:13.713
all hot and bothered,
and full of anger.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.682
Sure.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.284
What, you're
leaving now?

20:17.317 --> 20:20.720
Um... yeah.

20:20.753 --> 20:21.988
This is the notice you give me?
You're leaving now?

20:22.021 --> 20:23.790
Um, I know. I-I...

20:23.823 --> 20:25.592
Tony said I should,
you know, get acquainted...

20:25.625 --> 20:27.560
Tony. Mm-hmm.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.429
...while it's slow here,
'cause, you know,

20:29.462 --> 20:31.498
it's always slow, and...

20:31.531 --> 20:34.601
All right. Well,
good luck to you.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.936
Really, thank you
for everything.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.871
Yeah.

20:38.905 --> 20:39.939
I'm gonna miss this.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.341
Yeah.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.909
Yeah.
Uh...

20:46.613 --> 20:48.648
Um...

20:48.681 --> 20:51.418
Hey, I'll come back
and visit all the time.
Yeah.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.720
All right. Um...

20:53.753 --> 20:56.456
Bye, Janice.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.425
*

21:05.698 --> 21:08.335
Welcome to 911.
Thanks. Thanks, John.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.840
Hey, Janice.

21:13.873 --> 21:17.577
There's no waving or talking
between 911 and dispatch.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.013
It's the ultimate Bing Bong.

21:21.047 --> 21:24.016
So... Bing Bong.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.686
Good-bye. Forever.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.693
So, you want
a cup of tea?

21:33.726 --> 21:36.363
Okay, should be nice.
Yeah. Okay.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.564
No. I'll get it.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.599
No, no, it's fine.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.601
Oh, my... What?

21:41.634 --> 21:43.870
What?
What? You can st--
You can stand?

21:43.903 --> 21:46.706
Sure.
Yeah, just... ooh.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.841
On a good day.
Mm.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.610
Ouch.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.017
Janice?

21:58.050 --> 21:59.752
Bing Bong.

22:04.457 --> 22:07.026
HALDEMAN :
This case just got real, guys.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.761
DEA is setting up the pieces.

22:08.795 --> 22:12.365
Not long till
we pull the trigger.

22:12.399 --> 22:13.866
Woof, woof, woof!
That's what I'm talking... yeah.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.668
Woof, woof, woof!
That's the stuff
I'm talking about.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.370
I'm the big dog!
Yeah, you're the big dog.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.871
Whoa, whoa, ho, shut up. Oh.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.573
Haldeman, DEA.
Hey, man.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.008
Yeah, you coyotes ready
to fuck this thing?

22:22.041 --> 22:23.710
Oh, dude, we are ready to go.

22:23.743 --> 22:24.911
Great.
Um, you, I know you.

22:24.944 --> 22:27.414
Yeah, I want you guys to know
I got your back in there.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.015
Okay.
It's gonna get heavy.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.683
Okay.
It's gonna get
really heavy.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.719
All right. Yeah.
Expect the unexpected.

22:32.752 --> 22:33.953
These boys are
coming in ready.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.822
RPGs, flamethrowers,
hand grenades...

22:35.855 --> 22:37.156
Uh, I'm sorry,
hate to interrupt.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.791
I just want to say
that my partner here

22:38.825 --> 22:39.792
is a big fan of yours.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.994
Oh, no, no, I'm not.
You know, I'm just...

22:42.028 --> 22:43.696
He's always going on about
your Instagram account.
Shut up.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.498
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
He's like, "Oh, you know,

22:45.532 --> 22:47.434
Haldeman's got a new haircut
that's pretty sexy, and..."

22:47.467 --> 22:48.668
No, we're colleagues.
Whatever, we're all cops.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.670
Shut the fuck up. Yeah.
Never mind. Okay?

22:50.703 --> 22:52.839
So, uh, you were saying?
So, what's happening?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.073
Thank you very
much, by the way.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.075
Yeah.
Whatever. I'm...

22:56.108 --> 22:58.578
We expect word between
0300 and 0500 hours.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.012
So the raid is on?

23:00.046 --> 23:01.080
Boys, it's on.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.549
Oh, my God. Dude.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.784
It's on like Donkey Kong.
Yeah.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.052
You know what I mean?
You know that expression?
It is fucking on.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.721
Yeah. It's on.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.590
Right.
It's on, man.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.058
All right.
We've done that enough, I feel.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.594
Don't you?
Yeah, sorry, man.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.663
Yeah.
Um, I did not mean
to interrupt your flow.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.130
I didn't have a flow.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.966
Oh, man. Dude, I am pumped
to do this with you.

23:19.999 --> 23:20.767
I am also pumped, too.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.168
We're both pumped.
Yeah, yeah.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.836
Can't wait to get that medal.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.438
I'm gonna shove
that shiny thing

23:25.472 --> 23:27.807
in Kyle's shirt-dicking face.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.976
You know what I'm saying?
What does that mean?

23:30.009 --> 23:33.179
What's a shirt
It's a shirt-- Well, he's...

23:33.212 --> 23:36.015
He wears shirt-- shirt-dicking,
explain it to him.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shirt-dicking.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.150
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
Yeah, but what is it?

23:38.184 --> 23:39.452
Well, it's like when
you don't wear any pants...

23:39.486 --> 23:41.588
When you don't wear any pants,
you're just wearing a shirt.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.922
You guys do that?

23:42.955 --> 23:45.458
No. I don't. I mean,
his-- I mean...

23:45.492 --> 23:47.994
Sounds nice.
No, no. I do.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.029
I mean, it sounds stupid at
first, but then after, you know,

23:50.062 --> 23:51.864
when you think about it,
it's kind of cool.
Yeah.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.466
So, you and I are gonna
take the eastern perimeter.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.501
Mm-hmm.
All right. You and me?

23:54.534 --> 23:55.635
Yeah, you and me.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.169
Okay, dude. Eastern.
Okay.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.071
There a metal door
in the rear.
Right.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.240
Let's assume that
it's bolted shut.
BOTH: Assumed.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.510
Yeah. I got some detonators,
some short blast detonators

24:03.543 --> 24:05.077
I'm gonna put by it; we're gonna
explode it, we're gonna knock

24:05.111 --> 24:06.679
that fucking door right back
to hell where it started.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.049
Hold on, I got to get this.
Yeah, yeah.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.551
Who's gonna fix that door
after it's...

24:11.584 --> 24:12.785
No one. No one.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.821
Hello. Haldeman.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.690
Yeah, no, no, no.
I'm briefing the boys right now.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.659
Yeah, Team Coyote.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.562
What does that mean?

24:22.595 --> 24:24.897
What are you t...?

24:24.931 --> 24:27.066
Then who the fuck
am I talking to?

24:27.099 --> 24:29.702
Say that to me again.

24:29.736 --> 24:31.070
Hold on.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.106
You boys got I.D.?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.908
Yeah. Yeah, man.
Uh, sure.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.148
Real deal.
Real deal.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.250
All right, all right.
Okay. Thank you.

24:44.283 --> 24:46.953
Okay. We should've
showed him that before.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.822
Yeah, they're fucking SDPD.

24:49.856 --> 24:52.091
Fuck me in the fucking ass.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.794
Yeah, I don't know,
I don't know. Okay, yeah.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.096
All right, have your laughs,
have your fucking laughs, okay.

24:57.129 --> 24:59.265
All right, yeah,
then bring them over.

24:59.298 --> 25:02.569
Yeah, exactly.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.271
What the fuck?

25:05.304 --> 25:07.674
You guys said you
were Team Coyote.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.910
Oh, I thought you were saying,
like... I thought, I thought,

25:10.943 --> 25:13.279
I thought you were saying, like,
are you guys coyotes?

25:13.312 --> 25:17.083
Like, are we raw and ready and
hungry and wild. 'Cause we are.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.251
Why would I say,
"Are you guys coyotes?"

25:19.285 --> 25:21.220
Well, interesting fact
about coyotes,

25:21.253 --> 25:23.189
they're excellent swimmers.
Shut the fuck up.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.091
Lot of peop...
Shut the fuck up.
Yeah, uh, we get it.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.859
Can you do me a big favor?
BOTH: Oh, sure.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.227
Yeah, I mean,
this is a big favor.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.696
Man, anything.
I'm gonna need you

25:29.729 --> 25:31.030
to forget everything that
happened between us.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.732
Right.
This didn't happen.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.266
You guys go
about your day,

25:34.300 --> 25:36.969
playing, uh, fucking dick-shirts
or whatever you play,

25:37.003 --> 25:39.205
where you take your underpants
off and keep your T-shirt on.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.107
And I'm gonna go do the
raid with the boys.

25:41.140 --> 25:44.276
Deal?
Uh... Okay, we can
back you up, though.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.579
We're happy to. Look, we're
not doing anything else.
All right, forget everything.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.314
Okay.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.917
Wow.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.885
What the fuck, man?

25:52.919 --> 25:55.054
Never meet
your heroes, right?

25:55.087 --> 25:58.658
He's not my hero.
He's a fucking dick.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.627
I'm sorry.
No, don't be
sorry, man. I-I...

26:00.660 --> 26:02.629
He's a dick.

26:02.662 --> 26:04.196
Oh, wait,
he's coming back.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.632
Oh, hey.
Hey, one last thing.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.133
Yeah. Anything.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.235
Um, I'm gonna need
you to move this car.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.203
Right. It's just that we were
the first car here,

26:11.237 --> 26:13.072
so maybe we-we could stay--
maybe we should stay here,

26:13.105 --> 26:15.074
you know what I mean?
'Cause we got the intel.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.809
We got the local knowledge.
I'm gonna need
this fucking spot

26:16.843 --> 26:18.010
is what I'm saying.
Right.

who was kind *

27:22.008 --> 27:24.443
* He said that when he left

27:24.476 --> 27:28.147
* All his money would be mine

27:28.180 --> 27:33.085
* Well, he kicked the bucket
just the other night *

27:33.119 --> 27:34.887
* That's when I learned *

27:34.921 --> 27:38.357
* He lost his fortune
shooting dice *

* Well, you learn
something new every day *

27:44.163 --> 27:46.165
