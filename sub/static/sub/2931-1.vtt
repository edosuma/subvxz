01:42.732 --> 01:46.146
Burned the farm Pied des Vignes, two acres.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.277
- Where is it? - Rio Salado,

01:48.278 --> 01:50.620
the army is there. Help yourself.

01:50.621 --> 01:53.406
Here in Oran, does not feel both events.

01:53.407 --> 01:56.844
It is central Algiers, it will bomb, shootings.

01:56.845 --> 01:59.582
- And his son? - I'm happy with it.

01:59.583 --> 02:02.583
He said he will present his collection at Maison Prome.

02:02.584 --> 02:06.141
But not surprised he was hired by Dior.

02:06.142 --> 02:07.854
He always wanted that.

02:07.855 --> 02:10.322
With such a stylish mom.

02:28.951 --> 02:30.665
Do you like my dress?

02:30.972 --> 02:32.272
Yes, it's beautiful.

02:32.660 --> 02:34.083
Gotta work?

02:34.598 --> 02:36.509
I can always work well here.

02:37.670 --> 02:39.520
It should be you for inspiring me.

02:40.048 --> 02:42.364
- Michelle, stay at the table. - But I'm done.

02:42.365 --> 02:43.946
Met his friends?

02:43.947 --> 02:47.040
Well, I'll make the gown Marie Haizmann.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.600
I'm doing the design.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.274
Who will she marry?

02:50.275 --> 02:52.394
A son of settler Mascarin.

02:52.395 --> 02:54.745
With everything that is happening they will live there?

02:54.746 --> 02:58.026
No. They took an apartment on Avenue Lupée.

02:58.027 --> 02:59.763
It's safer.

03:05.116 --> 03:07.843
When I'm in Paris, I sometimes think of here.

03:08.484 --> 03:09.989
I believe in you.

03:12.056 --> 03:14.504
And I'm terribly distressed.

03:31.860 --> 03:33.816
Monsieur Mathieu Saint Laurent ...

03:34.994 --> 03:36.544
Good morning, Sr. Dior.

03:36.545 --> 03:38.527
Jean, Victoire, Hello.

03:38.528 --> 03:39.828
I do not see how you want

03:39.829 --> 03:41.929
decrease the size without better centralizing.

03:42.929 --> 03:44.876
Yes, if I may ...

04:38.308 --> 04:40.091
What do you think, Mademoiselle?

04:40.092 --> 04:41.578
I like it a lot.

04:46.227 --> 04:48.980
It will give thousands of rounds around the Earth.

04:48.981 --> 04:50.541
It's amazing, isn’t it?

04:51.413 --> 04:53.813
Actually, I guess that does not interest me much.

04:53.814 --> 04:55.806
- What was it called? 
- Sputnik.

04:55.807 --> 04:57.107
What a funny name.

04:57.108 --> 04:59.219
It is. Seems good for a dog.

04:59.659 --> 05:02.701
Works, want to see? Sputnik? Come here.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.731
- Come here, Sputnik! 
- How beautiful!

05:04.732 --> 05:06.111
Sputnik?

05:07.550 --> 05:10.793
- Victoire! Phone. 
- I’m going.

05:12.544 --> 05:15.235
Everything okay, Yves? You are half yellow.

05:15.236 --> 05:18.231
- No, I'm fine, thanks. 
- Take care of yourself!

05:18.232 --> 05:20.866
And eat! It is necessary at your age.

05:20.867 --> 05:23.650
The boss counts on you.

05:24.267 --> 05:25.567
Got it.

05:25.568 --> 05:27.623
It just bothers me.

05:27.624 --> 05:30.477
- It's true. You need to eat. 
- Yeah, but I'm not hungry.

05:32.151 --> 05:34.063
Who is she talking so long?

05:34.064 --> 05:35.848
Theron is the arm of Paris-Match

05:35.849 --> 05:37.594
Give up on her all the time.

05:37.595 --> 05:39.746
Really? How is he?

05:39.747 --> 05:41.993
He is attractive, a handsome man.

05:41.994 --> 05:45.162
- But is not too high. 
- Just want to see.

05:47.432 --> 05:49.847
Victoire, will it take long? We miss you.

05:49.848 --> 05:51.148
Victoire.

05:56.670 --> 05:58.877
Love Just for a moment

05:58.878 --> 06:01.414
That's what I want

06:01.721 --> 06:03.586
Love Just for a moment

06:03.587 --> 06:04.887
You, Karl?

06:05.672 --> 06:06.972
Go on, continue.

06:11.472 --> 06:15.472
I need to feel free, that's what I know

06:16.386 --> 06:18.869
Look here! Lagerfeld?

06:19.319 --> 06:20.963
I started singing

06:20.964 --> 06:24.244
And just try not to make me something of yours

06:26.115 --> 06:28.322
Just love me for a moment

06:28.323 --> 06:31.050
Not gonna hurt me

06:31.051 --> 06:34.495
Kiss Me Now'll star

07:08.115 --> 07:09.415
What do you want?

07:09.771 --> 07:12.194
What do I want? I don’t know.

07:13.303 --> 07:14.838
Stop, you're hurting me.

07:14.839 --> 07:16.440
IStop!

07:17.409 --> 07:18.959
He does not give more to the Rille?

07:18.960 --> 07:20.260
What are you talking about?

07:20.261 --> 07:22.276
Look at you, taking coke through a straw?

07:22.277 --> 07:24.393
- It’s wild. 
- What did you say?

07:25.249 --> 07:26.974
- I'll marry you ... 
- What?

07:28.548 --> 07:30.584
I said I'll marry you.

07:36.355 --> 07:38.615
Just love me for a moment

07:38.616 --> 07:41.414
Not gonna hurt me

07:41.415 --> 07:44.996
Kiss Me Now'll star

08:54.563 --> 08:59.039
Yves ... You were so young.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.047
So beautiful. So shy.

09:02.656 --> 09:03.956
So radiant.

09:05.523 --> 09:07.703
We haven’t met,

09:07.704 --> 09:10.305
and you alone would face their first battle.

09:44.326 --> 09:47.326
Art Subs 5 Years doing art for you!

09:47.327 --> 09:49.677
- Legendas - Durenkian | Hawkeye147

09:49.678 --> 09:52.028
- Revisão - Hirschen | English translation: fancy_subs

09:52.029 --> 09:54.750
A collection of art represents moments of life.

09:55.523 --> 09:58.668
And today, I'm selling our collection.

10:04.463 --> 10:07.111
Many of our objects were bought in pairs,

10:07.112 --> 10:11.727
Because they were chosen, appreciated and loved by two.

10:15.598 --> 10:19.453
Today, standing alone and without you, I can not even see them.

10:29.970 --> 10:32.115
This auction takes up all my time.

10:32.116 --> 10:34.466
I have to answer the same questions endlessly.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.719
"As this collection was assembled?"

10:36.720 --> 10:39.797
"What were your and my favorite picture?"

10:40.308 --> 10:42.224
I'm repeating the same thing.

10:46.821 --> 10:49.434
Yves, you appreciated the beauty.

10:51.375 --> 10:55.652
It is not known where the tastes are born, instincts...

10:55.653 --> 10:57.811
NOBODY teaches us.

10:58.476 --> 11:02.393
Be there from where we came, we were born with them.

11:18.851 --> 11:20.990
Like Christian Dior, the French Haute Couture

11:20.991 --> 11:23.231
loses one of its main representatives.

11:23.232 --> 11:25.143
One of his most prestigious names.

11:25.144 --> 11:27.714
Even princesses have accepted the laws of Dior.

11:27.715 --> 11:29.466
Every thought and action it

11:29.467 --> 11:31.967
were devoted to this manifestation of human genius

11:31.968 --> 11:34.953
that is fluid, and elusive, yet durable,

11:34.954 --> 11:36.649
called 'Fashion'.

11:37.792 --> 11:39.092
Yves?

11:39.609 --> 11:41.359
- They are waiting for you. 
- Okay.

11:46.013 --> 11:47.313
The future of the Maison

11:47.314 --> 11:49.809
provided by that Christian Dior

11:49.810 --> 11:52.545
had established.

11:53.410 --> 11:56.352
The studio will be headed by Mrs. Raimond-Zenacker.

11:56.990 --> 12:01.186
The director of sales remain Yvonne De Peyerimhoff.

12:01.187 --> 12:04.924
And Anne-Marie Muñoz will be director of the workshops.

12:05.548 --> 12:07.056
Finally,

12:07.057 --> 12:09.221
the artistic direction, will be entrusted

12:09.222 --> 12:11.190
to Yves Mathieu Saint Laurent,

12:11.191 --> 12:13.774
Christian Dior's assistant.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.275
Monsieur, don’t you feel too young

12:15.276 --> 12:17.876
to direct a major Maison of French Haute Couture?

12:18.296 --> 12:19.895
I still do not know.

12:19.896 --> 12:22.966
Can you tell us what do you want to do on your first show?

12:24.670 --> 12:27.245
I will try to do my best, of course.

12:28.380 --> 12:32.927
Lock myself in my room all day and night and I’m going to draw.

12:33.383 --> 12:35.316
How do you feel at this exact moment?

12:36.295 --> 12:38.691
I can not say everything I feel.

12:39.565 --> 12:43.269
Sadness, anguish ...

12:44.296 --> 12:47.123
and also joy, confidence.

12:48.619 --> 12:52.046
And also afraid of failing.

12:53.051 --> 12:56.025
But I will devote myself to the end.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.517
Addition, make my oath.

13:15.432 --> 13:18.050
At that time, I barely knew fashion.

13:18.051 --> 13:20.376
I believed only in the most fine arts.

13:20.377 --> 13:22.988
Literature, painting

13:22.989 --> 13:24.496
I’m a painter.

13:24.497 --> 13:27.497
- You can stop this ugly guy?
- I've had enough, I am tired.

13:27.498 --> 13:29.404
It never ends, ask him to leave.

13:29.405 --> 13:32.041
Stop crying. I have sold only five tables in Paris.

13:32.042 --> 13:34.842
Bernard, you will end up under the bridge... and what a bridge.

13:34.843 --> 13:36.410
- May God hear you. 
- Sorry.

13:36.411 --> 13:37.711
You're lucky, sweetheart.

13:37.712 --> 13:39.362
Think you'll find your Pigmalion?

13:40.026 --> 13:42.119
It's kind of dark. There is another picture...

13:42.120 --> 13:43.812
I will introduce it to my painter.

13:44.322 --> 13:46.801
Bernard, remember Marie Louise Bousquet,

13:46.802 --> 13:48.452
Editor in Chief of Harper's Bazaar?

13:48.453 --> 13:49.953
- Good evening. 
- I wanted to bring

13:49.954 --> 13:51.336
Yves Mathieu Saint Laurent.

13:51.337 --> 13:53.656
But the whiz kid is too busy.

13:54.062 --> 13:56.172
- It is the favourite painter of him. 
- Thank you.

13:56.173 --> 13:57.949
I need to organise a dinner.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.793
He admires him a lot, but he is so shy.

14:00.794 --> 14:02.292
I'm too shy.

14:02.293 --> 14:04.643
- What fun dinner. 
- Be wary of shy.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.437
They rule the world.

14:06.438 --> 14:08.188
Even so, I will arrange dinner

14:08.189 --> 14:09.489
But without you, Jean.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.123
A 32.

14:20.766 --> 14:22.926
It was great. Hit the trim.

14:22.927 --> 14:24.227
Thank you.

14:24.709 --> 14:26.304
Let's call him "Bobby."

14:26.828 --> 14:29.462
Thank you, Ms.. Thank you very much.

14:29.463 --> 14:31.513
Are you sure? Naming of dogs to them,

14:31.514 --> 14:33.319
will not be bad?

14:33.320 --> 14:34.804
No, no way.

14:35.482 --> 14:38.242
I grew up surrounded by dogs and love them.

14:38.243 --> 14:39.636
They are part of me.

14:40.161 --> 14:42.315
- Hello, Victoire. 
- Hello.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.820
The 42.

14:45.508 --> 14:49.011
Let's call it "Valentine". As the daughter of Zizi Jeanmaire.

14:49.682 --> 14:51.893
Very young like this, very cheerful.

14:51.894 --> 14:54.551
Flawless. I like a lot.

14:55.122 --> 14:56.711
Bravo!

14:56.712 --> 14:58.642
- Thank you, Victoire. 
- Thank you.

15:00.947 --> 15:02.249
Wow, he's really cute!

15:02.250 --> 15:05.138
- Yeah, but just like men. 
- Glad.

15:05.139 --> 15:07.439
Otherwise we would fight among us to have it.

15:08.724 --> 15:11.000
- It was also the latest model? 
- Yes, it’s over.

15:11.514 --> 15:13.423
We need to rest, Mr.

15:13.911 --> 15:15.211
- What? 
- The distribution

15:15.212 --> 15:16.820
The room of the runway/

15:16.821 --> 15:18.998
Right. But Monsieur should know ...

15:18.999 --> 15:20.906
Caring for susceptibilities, believe,

15:20.907 --> 15:22.222
is a whole policy.

15:22.223 --> 15:24.544
The first line is not enough for everyone.

15:24.545 --> 15:26.495
Yvonne, you know you don’t understand it.

15:26.496 --> 15:27.846
But it is important to organise.

15:27.847 --> 15:29.897
Mr. Dior himself gave the directions ...

15:29.898 --> 15:31.198
But I'm not Mr. Dior!

15:31.896 --> 15:34.146
- Forgive me for insisting, but... 
- Do not insist!

15:34.147 --> 15:35.827
I can not! I can not.

15:36.509 --> 15:37.809
Very well, Mr.

15:44.752 --> 15:47.795
Number 52.

15:48.474 --> 15:49.887
"Good Conduct".

16:05.859 --> 16:08.977
Number 26.

16:09.642 --> 16:10.957
"Canada".

16:10.958 --> 16:13.187
Beside Charlerrot Mont, who is she?

16:13.765 --> 16:16.226
She is Carmel Snow, from Harper's Bazaar.

16:16.227 --> 16:19.294
And to her right, Helène Nazareth, from Elle.

16:20.779 --> 16:22.719
- Nice hat. - It's ...

16:26.157 --> 16:29.108
Number 19.

16:29.109 --> 16:31.045
"Joujou".

16:41.397 --> 16:43.657
- Number 42 -. Slightly more, but beautiful.

16:43.658 --> 16:44.958
"Bobby".

16:47.062 --> 16:48.362
Thank you very much.

16:50.770 --> 16:52.070
Vire-se.

16:53.050 --> 16:54.350
Turn back.

16:57.657 --> 17:00.799
Number 62.

17:01.131 --> 17:02.954
"La Rouge".

17:04.101 --> 17:05.851
It's pretty good. Thank you, Victoire.

17:15.085 --> 17:16.385
You don’t like it?

17:16.915 --> 17:19.019
Yes, a lot. Very classic.

17:19.020 --> 17:20.319
It’s Dior.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.796
Number 42.

17:23.345 --> 17:25.019
"Valentine".

17:33.683 --> 17:36.125
It is magnificent that simplicity, that lightness.

17:36.126 --> 17:37.476
It's almost a "laisser aller".

17:38.054 --> 17:40.779
And that all this construction is that Dior temple.

18:32.620 --> 18:34.520
And the "Saint Pierre" is served with what?

18:34.521 --> 18:36.607
A "Ratatouille" with fresh vegetables.

18:36.608 --> 18:39.194
Can Saint Pierre with "pommes daufines"?

18:39.954 --> 18:41.982
No, no.

18:41.983 --> 18:45.147
I'll take ... The Chateaubriant ...

18:45.148 --> 18:46.754
With a ratatouille.

18:47.173 --> 18:48.834
No, sorry. A salad.

18:48.835 --> 18:50.527
I'll let you think about the options.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.975
Some people do not know what they want.

18:52.976 --> 18:54.919
Well, I understand.

18:55.464 --> 18:57.624
Out of my job I can not do anything.

18:57.625 --> 18:58.925
I'm lost.

18:59.495 --> 19:00.795
Thank you, Yves.

19:00.796 --> 19:02.346
At this point?

19:02.820 --> 19:05.070
If you knew a true mentally ill.

19:05.071 --> 19:07.669
Hardly know even write a check.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.530
Not even Yvonne?

19:09.531 --> 19:12.490
- Mr. you have other talents. 
- You are kind.

19:13.197 --> 19:16.806
- Are you a spoiled child? 
- Exactly.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.892
- Why, aren’t you? 
- No.

19:18.893 --> 19:20.977
My mother was a schoolteacher

19:21.309 --> 19:22.726
and was more severe with me

19:22.727 --> 19:25.116
than with the other students. I had to turn around.

19:25.454 --> 19:27.664
- He fled her ... 
- Since child.

19:28.137 --> 19:30.146
- Where was it? 
- La Rochelle.

19:30.559 --> 19:31.859
I, in Oran.

19:32.186 --> 19:34.856
When you came to do his thanks, just ...

19:34.857 --> 19:36.793
It seemed a seminarian.

19:37.553 --> 19:39.673
But I passed by the priests.

19:41.896 --> 19:43.696
When you will go to Provence, Bernard?

19:43.697 --> 19:45.079
Next week.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.665
And you, Yves?

19:46.666 --> 19:49.579
Well, I go visit my family in Algeria.

19:49.580 --> 19:52.022
In Algeria? There’s war, isn’t it?

19:52.023 --> 19:54.985
Must end. It's the rotten part of France.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.895
I'm sorry for you.

20:00.173 --> 20:02.249
So, accept my apologies.

20:03.714 --> 20:06.025
No, I did it. I should have avoided talking about it.

20:06.026 --> 20:07.753
No, it's okay.

20:07.754 --> 20:10.403
And I'm not willing to go this summer.

20:10.404 --> 20:12.444
I want to change.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.237
So come with us.

20:15.740 --> 20:19.060
The countryside has style, Giono, I have a great chef,

20:19.061 --> 20:21.486
- Cicadas. 
- And there you suppose?

20:21.886 --> 20:23.186
Yes?

20:24.778 --> 20:27.117
No thanks. I do not drink.

22:13.899 --> 22:15.999
Yves, I just think his portrait.

22:20.180 --> 22:21.480
Thank you.

22:25.983 --> 22:27.983
We will be how many for dinner tonight?

22:29.023 --> 22:30.323
Eight.

22:32.834 --> 22:34.334
Cancel.

24:04.582 --> 24:07.326
I thought I cultivated fidelity,

24:07.644 --> 24:10.458
but with you, remember?

24:10.459 --> 24:12.263
It all happened very fast.

24:25.415 --> 24:26.715
…sublime.

24:27.623 --> 24:29.656
There is room to reform.

24:29.657 --> 24:31.937
- Good night, Zizi. 
- Hello, Victoire.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.788
- How do you do? 
- Very well, thank you.

24:34.226 --> 24:35.926
I present to you my husband, Roger.

24:35.927 --> 24:37.227
A great admirer of yours.

24:37.228 --> 24:38.584
I’ll show your office.

24:42.222 --> 24:43.522
Look...

24:44.387 --> 24:45.964
- Beautiful, isn’t it? 
- Very cute.

24:45.965 --> 24:47.715
And back there is the office of Pierre.

24:49.850 --> 24:52.316
- Where are the rooms? 
- We only have one.

24:53.426 --> 24:55.703
So actually we live together.

24:55.704 --> 24:58.285
- Yes 
- Why didn’t you tell me?

24:58.286 --> 25:00.992
You are happily married with Paris-Match , is not it?

25:01.759 --> 25:03.954
Come, I will show them the balcony.

25:05.306 --> 25:06.988
Pierre? Pierre.

25:08.112 --> 25:09.662
You know my friend, Victoire?

25:09.663 --> 25:11.804
I know your image by magazines.

25:12.657 --> 25:14.011
- Hello 
- She’s the woman with whom

25:14.012 --> 25:15.517
I always wanted to marry.

25:15.518 --> 25:16.818
Stop it.

25:17.652 --> 25:19.486
My one-third, prepare vodkas.

25:22.238 --> 25:23.787
Is she jealous?

25:26.253 --> 25:28.022
You have fun.

25:29.584 --> 25:31.228
I'm not so nice as well.

25:34.395 --> 25:36.845
Mom, maybe you should get out there, you never know.

25:37.414 --> 25:38.771
And where would we?

25:39.888 --> 25:41.915
Here is our home, our country.

25:42.682 --> 25:44.083
What does Dad think?

25:44.998 --> 25:47.468
What do you think? He thinks like me.

25:48.319 --> 25:50.057
I can not imagine. I...

25:51.694 --> 25:53.582
What happened, dear?

25:53.583 --> 25:56.744
You know ... I do not know if I can postpose.

25:57.233 --> 25:59.468
If drafted, I will not.

26:02.014 --> 26:03.628
Not be able to do this.

26:03.629 --> 26:06.671
Yves, nobody would believe you seeing using weapons.

26:11.323 --> 26:13.103
Mom, I'm sorry.

26:16.430 --> 26:18.611
Gently lift the arms, so ...

26:18.612 --> 26:20.565
What are you thinking?

26:20.566 --> 26:22.458
- It's a fair bit. 
- Here tightens?

26:22.459 --> 26:23.759
Soon.

26:23.760 --> 26:26.510
Yves, did you knew that Karl took the artistic direction of Patou?

26:26.984 --> 26:28.618
Give my kiss to him.

26:29.728 --> 26:32.178
Why do not we dance? He misses you.

26:32.179 --> 26:33.850
Roger is closing the issue.

26:33.851 --> 26:35.451
And Rossi must finish London.

26:35.452 --> 26:37.257
Lord, don’t forget the reporters.

26:37.258 --> 26:39.062
Again? What do they want?

26:39.063 --> 26:40.513
They want to make an appointment.

26:40.514 --> 26:42.398
Why did you tell them that I am here?

26:43.563 --> 26:46.304
But you could go, couldn’t it, Mr. Saint Laurent?

26:46.305 --> 26:48.355
Stop press, I'm working.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.723
Give me peace.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.388
Give me ... That dress doesn’t. You can’t even.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.782
Can you leave us alone, please?

26:56.847 --> 26:58.508
I said, get out!

26:58.509 --> 27:00.409
- You too, Yvonne. 
- All right, sir.

27:00.410 --> 27:03.198
Where is the chantum, gray, I need to finish.

27:03.963 --> 27:06.403
- This isn’t! 
- Yves, what is it?

27:07.270 --> 27:08.570
Yves?

27:09.458 --> 27:10.758
I design.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.670
I design, I design not to listen.

27:13.671 --> 27:15.190
I need to finish it.

27:15.191 --> 27:17.520
- Not listen to what? 
- The screams, or the silence.

27:17.521 --> 27:20.234
Always continues. Ever since the beginning.

27:20.235 --> 27:21.671
- Yves? 
- Continue.

27:21.672 --> 27:24.456
Calm down. Yves, I'm here.

27:24.457 --> 27:26.257
- I need to finish it. 
- I'm here.

27:27.694 --> 27:29.293
You have the talent.

27:29.710 --> 27:31.501
Of the rest, I care.

27:32.277 --> 27:35.472
- I will always support you. 
- Really?

27:46.772 --> 27:49.183
I received my letter of incorporation.

27:51.052 --> 27:53.302
Were you summoned by the army Mr. Saint Laurent?

27:53.303 --> 27:55.353
Will he have time to present his new show?

27:55.354 --> 27:57.628
Will he always be the "little prince" of fashion?

27:57.629 --> 27:59.729
Let the questions for later, please.

27:59.730 --> 28:01.435
- Who are you? 
- Pierre Berger.

28:01.436 --> 28:03.286
- Please. 
- He's too busy.

28:03.287 --> 28:06.364
- Let him quiet. 
- And the events in Algeria?

28:06.365 --> 28:07.665
Don’t you have something to say?

28:07.666 --> 28:09.947
My only battle is to dress women.

28:09.948 --> 28:12.419
Battle? Just to appear in imprensa?

28:12.420 --> 28:15.012
- Lady... 
- My son died in Algeria.

28:15.013 --> 28:17.063
- He had his age. 
- How do you answer that?

28:18.174 --> 28:19.474
I HAVE shame in the face!

28:24.330 --> 28:26.815
"Yves Saint Laurent hesitates to take up arms.

28:27.321 --> 28:30.168
Political education or opportunism? "

28:30.950 --> 28:33.824
Clearly they do not understand.

28:33.825 --> 28:36.429
Mr. Boussac, give me a little more time.

28:36.430 --> 28:38.083
Time? I have no time.

28:38.789 --> 28:41.342
The press will end us if we do not react now.

28:42.538 --> 28:45.623
And you are still too young to resist such attacks.

28:45.624 --> 28:47.524
- You could ... 
- Sir, I feel

28:47.525 --> 28:50.453
Very well at the artistic direction of Maison Dior in Paris.

28:51.495 --> 28:53.993
I'm not in the habit of escaping criticism.

28:53.994 --> 28:57.112
And flee your duties as a citizen does not bother you?

28:57.113 --> 28:59.483
You already got me a postponement ...

28:59.484 --> 29:01.169
Not so simple.

29:07.227 --> 29:10.663
Days later, you responded to the order of incorporation.

29:12.181 --> 29:14.260
But the army and you ...

29:14.261 --> 29:15.920
Empty your pockets, please.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.718
Can not get past the Val de Grace hospital.

29:21.204 --> 29:23.204
This is not a prison, I think.

29:26.138 --> 29:28.538
I’m Dr. Schellner, chief of psychiatric service.

29:28.539 --> 29:29.839
It was I who called you.

29:31.366 --> 29:33.289
There is a simple crisis.

29:33.290 --> 29:36.139
Oh Sr. Mathieu-Saint Laurent is maniac and depressive.

29:38.263 --> 29:40.421
What are you Sir?

29:42.371 --> 29:43.671
Friend.

29:43.672 --> 29:45.369
Mate.

29:45.370 --> 29:47.493
Are you willing to confront this?

29:49.412 --> 29:50.712
Yes.

30:03.232 --> 30:04.532
Hello, Pierre.

30:09.035 --> 30:10.485
You will not stay here long.

30:11.346 --> 30:12.746
I want to sleep.

30:14.075 --> 30:15.625
Are you comfortable?

30:24.530 --> 30:27.831
His mother is in Fontainable Hotel next door.

30:28.307 --> 30:30.258
Why won’t you see her?

30:31.207 --> 30:33.118
Now I'm tired.

30:36.044 --> 30:38.193
I just want to be left in peace.

30:40.605 --> 30:41.905
I'm tired ...

30:48.808 --> 30:50.108
I would like ...

30:50.109 --> 30:51.835
Do you want something to drink?

30:52.511 --> 30:53.811
Later.

30:54.365 --> 30:57.377
I’ll offer you anything to eat. The food here is ...

30:57.378 --> 30:59.597
It is an ordeal.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.059
You won’t like it.

31:07.025 --> 31:08.325
Back in Oran...

31:10.429 --> 31:12.784
A tail was like a criminal.

31:15.208 --> 31:16.508
At school...

31:17.673 --> 31:19.515
At St. Louis they...

31:20.347 --> 31:21.647
They hit me.

31:22.914 --> 31:25.098
Locked me in the bathroom, "fagot".

31:25.625 --> 31:27.374
Fagot, that's what I heard.

31:30.828 --> 31:32.878
I came home all busted and...

31:34.224 --> 31:35.832
She did not take care of me.

31:40.754 --> 31:42.172
Not cared for me.

31:42.861 --> 31:44.230
Yves?

31:44.231 --> 31:45.531
Look at me.

31:45.532 --> 31:47.128
I want to be alone, quiet.

31:49.264 --> 31:51.263
Now go away, please.

31:53.377 --> 31:54.677
Go away.

31:54.678 --> 31:56.714
Please look at me.

32:02.933 --> 32:05.335
Whether you want to continue living or dying?

32:07.214 --> 32:10.396
If you want to die, I can not do anything for you.

32:25.810 --> 32:30.200
Boussac took advantage of the occasion to break his contract.

32:30.201 --> 32:31.890
He replaced you.

32:34.790 --> 32:37.026
He has no right to fire you as well.

32:38.508 --> 32:40.273
- Let's fight. 
- Look, Pierre,

32:41.471 --> 32:42.889
I wish I could design.

32:42.890 --> 32:46.027
Create independently. Can you understand that?

32:47.963 --> 32:49.263
With my dresses,

32:49.264 --> 32:50.587
with my designs, I ...

32:50.588 --> 32:53.538
I try to express myself. If you stop me, I will die.

32:53.953 --> 32:55.653
Do you understand? I'll die of boredom.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.921
You need to rest.

32:59.922 --> 33:02.230
- He is still fragile. 
- But you're not.

33:02.686 --> 33:04.747
You're strong, right?

33:08.094 --> 33:10.344
We should open our own Couture Maison.

33:12.256 --> 33:13.788
Yes, I want to live.

33:16.090 --> 33:18.027
But I want to live with you.

33:26.730 --> 33:28.030
Hello, doctor.

33:28.031 --> 33:30.525
- Mr. Berger... 
- You're late.

33:30.983 --> 33:33.353
Yeah, I'm sorry. Things are complicated.

33:33.354 --> 33:34.654
Want something to drink?

33:34.655 --> 33:36.805
No thanks. I have a meeting in a half hour.

33:37.535 --> 33:38.855
I'm listening to you.

33:40.991 --> 33:42.747
I want to turn the courts to Dior,

33:42.748 --> 33:44.453
abusive to break contract.

33:44.772 --> 33:47.822
Boussac did what he wanted to Yves, he wants him to pay for it.

33:47.823 --> 33:49.610
No, what are you thinking?

33:49.611 --> 33:51.811
At 700 francs for damages and any applicable interest.

33:51.812 --> 33:53.412
Are you aware that attacking Boussac

33:53.413 --> 33:55.312
is attacking the richest man in France?

33:55.313 --> 33:56.869
Exactly.

33:57.739 --> 33:59.039
Boussac sure

33:59.040 --> 34:00.792
no one dares to attack him.

34:02.956 --> 34:04.987
Nor distrust. It is his weakness.

34:09.938 --> 34:11.329
It was not easy to get.

34:11.330 --> 34:13.103
The Baron's friend Roger.

34:13.105 --> 34:14.554
Listen to what they say

34:14.556 --> 34:17.201
and not show your game right away.

34:19.013 --> 34:20.313
Hello

34:25.925 --> 34:27.225
- Morel. 
- How are you?

34:27.679 --> 34:28.978
Hello

34:29.668 --> 34:30.967
Sirs.

34:33.099 --> 34:34.399
Thank you.

34:37.625 --> 34:39.289
- Hello, Sr. Berger. 
- Hello.

34:39.290 --> 34:40.995
- What a delight. 
- Gentlemen.

34:40.996 --> 34:44.873
I was telling him how much I admire Baron.

34:45.658 --> 34:47.193
You are very kind.

34:47.194 --> 34:48.868
You know nothing about fashion

34:48.869 --> 34:51.154
and you will launch in the world of haute couture,

34:51.155 --> 34:53.155
requiring huge investments?

34:53.531 --> 34:55.831
To do business you need to take risks.

34:55.831 --> 34:58.114
But businesses are not Russian roulette.

34:59.330 --> 35:00.630
Sure.

35:00.631 --> 35:02.028
Gentlemen,

35:02.421 --> 35:05.071
in this case, our capital is called Yves Saint Laurent

35:05.841 --> 35:07.141
with his enormous talent.

35:07.142 --> 35:09.409
Not sure what a psychiatric hospital

35:09.410 --> 35:10.710
is a deposit of gold.

35:11.771 --> 35:13.071
How so?

35:13.072 --> 35:15.333
Currently, Mr. Berger...

35:15.334 --> 35:19.154
Your project seems to me...

35:19.155 --> 35:21.852
risky.

35:23.015 --> 35:26.090
I hope you do not leave mad.

35:26.091 --> 35:28.491
But perhaps in the future, whether we are looking for him.

35:28.857 --> 35:30.157
If you think so...

35:33.271 --> 35:34.731
We can not continue like this.

35:34.732 --> 35:36.032
There is no profit margin.

35:37.001 --> 35:38.495
And this is the cheapest.

35:40.019 --> 35:41.419
I do not know what to do.

35:42.259 --> 35:43.959
- Yes, he told me. 
- Say what?

35:43.960 --> 35:45.326
- Pierre? 
- Say what?

35:45.327 --> 35:46.769
Pierre, look at this!

35:46.770 --> 35:48.264
Without consequences, isn’t it?

35:48.265 --> 35:50.003
It has been said and repeated, Yves,

35:50.004 --> 35:51.621
it’s a side effect of treatment.

35:51.622 --> 35:54.140
This is talk, look, are tufts.

35:54.141 --> 35:56.117
I'm losing tufts of hair.

35:56.118 --> 35:57.618
He always talks to you like that?

35:57.619 --> 35:59.788
It is because nobody wants to invest in you

35:59.789 --> 36:01.642
you will fill me with that hair.

36:01.643 --> 36:04.043
The fact is that you do not find anyone to invest,

36:04.044 --> 36:05.344
that's the problem.

36:05.345 --> 36:06.895
Like two whores of Hamburg.

36:06.896 --> 36:08.996
Karl, please. It's complicated.

36:08.997 --> 36:11.491
- Sorry, Roger. 
- And if you come to New York?

36:11.492 --> 36:13.592
Does he wants to do panties in New York?

36:13.897 --> 36:15.747
And why not? At this point.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.260
What design is this? That's funny.

36:18.261 --> 36:20.034
Yes, it's funny, Karl. I know it is.

36:20.035 --> 36:21.585
It is to show the Zizi Jeanmaire.

36:21.586 --> 36:24.346
A large male pullover and a black leotard. Incredible!

36:24.347 --> 36:25.847
And why am I the last to know?

36:25.848 --> 36:27.330
Because your husband does not count.

36:27.331 --> 36:29.035
Yeah, but I work, my dear.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.196
Lucky you.

36:33.696 --> 36:35.953
Yves, you are a genius.

36:35.954 --> 36:37.679
What?

36:37.680 --> 36:39.455
We win.

36:39.456 --> 36:40.880
That's the good news.

36:41.685 --> 36:44.588
- And what's the bad? 
- We can’t get 700 thousand.

36:45.430 --> 36:47.222
Only 680,000.

36:48.306 --> 36:49.735
It does not hurt.

36:49.736 --> 36:52.286
Withdraw the 20,000 missing from your fees.

36:53.759 --> 36:56.035
- No, just kidding. 
- How much is missing?

36:56.036 --> 36:58.978
- Double. 
- Really? That's it?

36:59.672 --> 37:02.475
Fuck the money. The important thing is to have succeeded.

37:02.476 --> 37:03.776
Yves!

37:06.324 --> 37:07.624
We win!

37:26.169 --> 37:27.819
Good day. The Paris-Match , please.

37:27.820 --> 37:29.479
Paris-Match , there it is.

37:29.480 --> 37:32.030
Needed to find investors anyway.

37:32.370 --> 37:34.262
Victoire helped us.

37:34.263 --> 37:35.563
The Paris-Match published:

37:35.564 --> 37:38.314
"Yves Saint Laurent opens his own Maison de couture".

37:38.315 --> 37:41.625
It was a huge bluff with two million copies.

37:41.626 --> 37:45.014
And a millionaire in Atlanta bet on us.

38:07.224 --> 38:08.524
Who else?

38:08.926 --> 38:11.776
Marise, an employee. Manage orders as anyone.

38:11.777 --> 38:14.500
And Denise, the control will be most happy to help.

38:14.501 --> 38:16.102
She has an amazing fidelity.

38:16.103 --> 38:18.540
- And Ferdinand. 
- Who is he?

38:18.541 --> 38:22.119
The doorman. Knows the habits of customers, a gold mine.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.870
But he retired. Six months ago.

38:23.871 --> 38:25.959
- Can I talk to him. 
- I'll do that.

38:26.359 --> 38:28.615
With the Boran collection was a delight

38:28.616 --> 38:30.483
It was amazing what he did.

38:30.484 --> 38:32.184
Okay, find a substitute.

38:32.185 --> 38:34.586
Right. And who will choose the mannequins?

38:34.587 --> 38:35.887
- Anne-Marie? 
- No, no ...

38:35.888 --> 38:37.332
Okay, then.

39:03.992 --> 39:05.765
I think...

39:05.766 --> 39:08.034
The long dress will look great on Raffaele.

39:11.762 --> 39:13.539
The small tube in Esther.

39:16.191 --> 39:19.321
The plisse skirt will look very elegant in Anne.

39:22.253 --> 39:23.953
For Victoire, the dress with veils.

39:25.126 --> 39:26.665
Girls, after the runway

39:26.666 --> 39:29.873
may use them in public during the season.

39:30.775 --> 39:32.230
Come on, girls, let's go.

39:32.605 --> 39:34.308
Thank you, ladies.

39:52.556 --> 39:54.945
How awful. Why do it?

39:54.946 --> 39:56.321
It does not hurt, Yves.

39:56.322 --> 39:57.963
- It does not hurt. 
- What is it?

39:57.964 --> 39:59.413
Look at the horror, look.

39:59.414 --> 40:01.313
Has the audacity to cut my hair.

40:01.314 --> 40:02.921
But you're just beautiful, sophisticated.

40:02.922 --> 40:05.050
Lost roster, cheese.

40:05.051 --> 40:06.875
- Maybe, I'll wear a hat. 
- Is it?

40:06.876 --> 40:09.626
- And the second entry? 
- A Wig, find her one.

40:09.627 --> 40:10.977
- I have a wig. 
- Of course.

40:10.978 --> 40:12.278
Marianne, are you ready?

40:15.453 --> 40:17.906
Hello, Mrs. Snow. Thanks for coming.

40:17.907 --> 40:20.470
Thank you. Hello Mrs., did you have a good trip?

40:20.471 --> 40:22.476
You are superb.

40:22.477 --> 40:24.977
- Mr. Mathieu Saint Laurent... 
- Mr. Saint Laurent!

40:24.978 --> 40:26.728
I chose to use the name of the couturier.

40:26.729 --> 40:28.380
- Can I see my child? 
- No

40:28.381 --> 40:29.869
is busy with mannequins.

40:29.870 --> 40:32.069
Ivonne when Elizabeth Arden arrive

40:32.070 --> 40:34.970
do not put her next to Helena Rubinstein. She hates her.

40:34.971 --> 40:36.271
Settle.

40:36.272 --> 40:37.657
Zizi, his Roland did not come?

40:37.658 --> 40:39.726
No, he's on tour.

40:39.727 --> 40:41.827
He works too hard. Princess Radziwill ...

40:41.828 --> 40:43.478
Glad you came. Really.

40:44.700 --> 40:47.050
Fernando, thanks for coming to New York, I loved it.

40:47.051 --> 40:48.351
And the lingerie?

40:48.352 --> 40:50.694
On Park Avenue, all use. It is a triumph!

40:50.695 --> 40:51.995
Very well. Very well.

40:51.996 --> 40:54.148
Sorry, hello! How are you?

40:54.149 --> 40:56.404
- Karl did not come? 
- No, he is doing ...

40:56.405 --> 40:58.816
Prêt-à-porter now. Like Cardin.

40:58.817 --> 41:01.017
He thinks couture is prehistoric.

41:01.641 --> 41:03.741
The girls are ready? Marianne, ready?

41:03.742 --> 41:05.435
Leonard, hello?

41:05.436 --> 41:07.155
It's time. Enough!

41:08.770 --> 41:11.681
Stay focused, calm down. Begins in five minutes.

41:53.878 --> 41:55.178
Use your charm.

41:56.968 --> 41:58.602
Victoire, fast.

42:03.106 --> 42:04.642
Vire.

42:07.086 --> 42:08.386
Victoire!

42:09.545 --> 42:10.845
Go.

42:35.233 --> 42:36.533
It fits well. Great.

42:36.534 --> 42:37.834
Thank you, may go.

42:43.635 --> 42:44.935
Yves.

43:47.923 --> 43:49.639
Yves, turn.

43:58.516 --> 43:59.816
Go there.

44:06.277 --> 44:07.577
Congratulations, Yves.

44:35.404 --> 44:36.704
Yves!

44:52.073 --> 44:53.373
Congratulations to all!

44:55.546 --> 44:58.877
"With soft forms, and elegance without interest,

44:58.878 --> 45:01.223
to rival Chanel,

45:01.224 --> 45:03.213
Saint Laurent shows in purity.

45:03.214 --> 45:05.266
Although producing a good collection,

45:05.267 --> 45:07.447
it does not bring anything really new.

45:08.215 --> 45:10.544
It's all taken care of, but monotonous.

45:10.545 --> 45:13.794
The future will tell us if it is not just a flash in the pan."

45:14.940 --> 45:16.690
Idiots!

45:20.363 --> 45:22.410
They expected too much.

45:22.904 --> 45:24.679
I could only disappoint them.

45:26.300 --> 45:28.718
But you're right, scored them.

45:29.098 --> 45:31.204
Fashion is not an art major.

45:31.205 --> 45:33.551
It is not even an art.

45:33.552 --> 45:36.354
To do it how you do, an artist is needed.

45:41.753 --> 45:43.911
The artist is teasing me.

45:46.488 --> 45:48.838
- It's true. 
- Turn yourself.

45:48.839 --> 45:50.459
Oh yeah, I'm feeling.

45:54.835 --> 45:57.156
- I love you. 
- What?

45:57.157 --> 46:01.030
- I love you. 
- I don’t understand.

46:09.955 --> 46:11.257
Nem ouse!

46:11.258 --> 46:13.450
Go to the front of the mirror, let's hit.

46:13.451 --> 46:14.751
- But you can’t. 
- Give, yes.

46:14.752 --> 46:16.052
- You can not take a look. 
- Give, yes.

46:16.053 --> 46:17.353
So it’s perfect.

46:17.988 --> 46:20.304
His vision of perfection always makes ...

46:20.617 --> 46:21.917
Nuvens! Look.

46:21.918 --> 46:23.791
No, please.

46:24.322 --> 46:28.439
No, we don’t send the designs. We sent the clothes ...

46:29.791 --> 46:32.262
We make clothes here, of course. In Paris...

46:33.890 --> 46:36.733
But it's couture. Quality is the most important.

46:36.734 --> 46:38.934
- Yes, quality. 
- Sir, the meeting of 16h...

46:38.935 --> 46:40.685
- I think… 
- Is the U.S., let me.

46:40.686 --> 46:43.070
- Not a good idea... 
- I'm on the phone! Damn!

46:44.167 --> 46:45.913
Excuse me. Yes.

46:47.093 --> 46:49.842
It may take five or 17 dresses ...

46:52.565 --> 46:54.158
25 dresses?

46:56.077 --> 46:57.977
- Saint Laurent is in the studio? 
- Yes

46:57.978 --> 46:59.478
Need to send flowers to Ivonne.

46:59.479 --> 47:00.879
- White roses. 
- I sent them.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.180
Thank you.

47:03.858 --> 47:06.319
I'm having dinner with the Duchess of Windsor...

47:06.925 --> 47:09.591
I sold 25 pieces to Hartmann.

47:09.592 --> 47:11.233
Congratulations!

47:11.940 --> 47:13.658
Ask Pierre to go out with you.

47:13.659 --> 47:17.039
He can take her dancing, walking by the bars.

47:17.040 --> 47:19.897
No. Actually, it's not his specialty.

47:19.898 --> 47:21.598
It is more spaghetti at home.

47:21.599 --> 47:23.967
- But now would be good. 
- It has its charm, of course.

47:24.659 --> 47:27.779
Pierre, you are kind, will give a dinner at Victoire.

47:27.780 --> 47:29.985
- She is alone. 
- I'm alone.

47:29.986 --> 47:31.541
Look at the poor thing.

47:31.542 --> 47:33.092
- Who is alone? 
- I am.

47:33.093 --> 47:35.487
- It's her. 
- I am.

48:07.101 --> 48:08.558
Will be ready soon.

48:15.384 --> 48:17.060
At least disguise.

48:17.061 --> 48:19.495
- Or what? 
- He supports me.

48:19.496 --> 48:21.490
- But like you, Victoire. 
- Really?

48:21.491 --> 48:23.525
- Yes, of course. 
- And that's just me talking

48:23.526 --> 48:25.167
with Yves and you may roll?

48:25.168 --> 48:27.432
Gets aggressive, starts barking.

48:27.433 --> 48:29.291
- I am barking? 
- Lately all the time.

48:29.684 --> 48:31.434
Okay, and bark is not like you.

48:31.435 --> 48:33.385
You are very false and affected with Yves.

48:33.386 --> 48:35.684
- Banking director. 
- You named me.

48:35.685 --> 48:36.985
But you are not at the level.

48:39.352 --> 48:42.131
What's more, order dinner. Finished dinner!

49:40.413 --> 49:41.838
What are you doing there?

49:41.839 --> 49:44.447
They're here. Do not let journalists waiting.

49:44.448 --> 49:46.462
Amazing, look. It is magnificent!

49:46.463 --> 49:47.913
Yes, it is very beautiful. Come on.

49:47.914 --> 49:51.074
- How much does it costs? 
- I do not know. I will send the invoice.

49:52.970 --> 49:54.270
Here it is.

49:54.655 --> 49:55.955
Hello, ladies.

49:56.391 --> 49:58.244
- Hello. 
- Mr. Saint Laurent.

49:58.245 --> 49:59.567
- Hello 
- Hello

50:00.056 --> 50:01.824
- Nice. 
- Nice.

50:04.240 --> 50:05.540
Mr. Saint Laurent

50:05.541 --> 50:09.328
after 26 years you own your own Maison de Couture.

50:09.329 --> 50:11.081
What are you up to?

50:11.082 --> 50:13.798
Do less crap, mostly.

50:14.805 --> 50:16.936
Say that to the extent that ...

50:16.937 --> 50:20.097
I assumed responsibilities too early.

50:20.996 --> 50:23.846
And... I sometimes have the feeling ...

50:23.847 --> 50:25.865
I’m not to be living my youth.

50:25.866 --> 50:28.216
The day after grueling day super gifted in fashion

50:28.217 --> 50:29.517
Is it not too heavy?

50:29.518 --> 50:31.789
I think those words a bit pretentious.

50:32.841 --> 50:36.176
Let's say that without the seamstresses, my designs would be nothing.

50:36.177 --> 50:38.973
It is a manual art, first of all.

50:38.974 --> 50:40.274
A collective work.

50:40.275 --> 50:41.575
Sorry.

50:41.576 --> 50:44.224
Whether it's for better stop talking nonsense.

50:50.861 --> 50:53.937
Please excuse me, I have work waiting.

50:56.026 --> 50:58.864
But ... Mr. Berger will answer you.

51:05.361 --> 51:08.261
Fruit juice or champagne, which one prefer ladies?

51:09.415 --> 51:10.715
- Yes, well ... 
- Yes?

51:11.143 --> 51:12.549
Albert?

51:12.550 --> 51:14.339
Excuse me or Mr. Laurent ...

51:14.340 --> 51:16.297
He is too modest.

51:16.298 --> 51:19.270
He may even apologize to exist.

51:19.271 --> 51:21.564
- This softens. 
- I think so.

51:23.188 --> 51:26.656
But he's right, fashion is not just talk, it's hard work.

51:28.108 --> 51:29.856
And, by the way,

51:29.857 --> 51:31.912
instead this interview,

51:31.913 --> 51:34.015
which would find the ...

51:34.016 --> 51:36.862
see the work? Behind the scenes, the workshops ...

51:36.863 --> 51:39.263
- The next show? 
- Yes, with pleasure.

51:39.929 --> 51:41.229
So we will.

51:41.903 --> 51:43.882
That does not stop us from drinking a glass.

53:06.095 --> 53:09.024
I did nothing wrong, was not only among us, agree?

53:11.995 --> 53:14.115
They didn’t like it, is it?

53:17.558 --> 53:19.669
It’s not that bad, right?

53:20.350 --> 53:22.861
It's fun, isn’t it? They are all there in the cell

53:22.862 --> 53:24.306
waiting to take pictures.

53:24.952 --> 53:26.476
Too much fun ...

53:27.711 --> 53:29.983
As she is angry, my goodness.

53:30.710 --> 53:32.010
Will say that I never made​​?

53:32.011 --> 53:35.388
- Hunt down so no. 
- I forgot, it's true ...

53:35.389 --> 53:38.061
- You are a real man. 
- Are you who you say.

53:38.531 --> 53:39.935
And how to be one, I know?

53:40.245 --> 53:42.685
I do not know, ask Victoire. She loved it.

53:59.539 --> 54:01.566
Before, no "settler" was said.

54:01.567 --> 54:03.266
I felt like French.

54:03.267 --> 54:06.347
- French Algeria. 
- I can not forgive France.

54:08.104 --> 54:10.156
Took a decision?

54:10.157 --> 54:11.457
We're still hesitating.

54:11.458 --> 54:13.679
I do not want to leave Oran.

54:13.680 --> 54:15.702
And you, Brigitte, do you already know where you will live?

54:15.703 --> 54:18.756
Robert and I believe in Nice or Monaco.

54:18.757 --> 54:20.816
- And you, Dad? 
- Where my daughter is.

54:20.817 --> 54:22.525
That's what I like.

54:22.526 --> 54:24.822
You can leave if you want, I'll be in Paris.

54:25.220 --> 54:26.974
So you will not feel alone.

54:27.498 --> 54:29.607
But I'm not alone, you know.

54:30.189 --> 54:31.497
Well, I must go.

54:31.835 --> 54:33.867
When deciding for apartment or house,

54:33.868 --> 54:35.648
let me know. Take care of everything.

54:39.322 --> 54:42.124
Want me to stay with you in Paris, my dear?

54:42.773 --> 54:44.073
Yes, of course.

54:55.730 --> 54:57.040
This is leather?

54:57.041 --> 54:59.713
Long boots are the crocodile patent leather.

54:59.714 --> 55:01.014
It is modern.

55:04.318 --> 55:05.618
Thank you, Ms..

55:07.413 --> 55:09.805
Sporting group. Cover black tarp.

55:09.806 --> 55:13.365
Ladies brown jacket. The new YSL woman's silhouette.

55:17.208 --> 55:19.862
It's the trend in that war parties of Elisha.

55:21.074 --> 55:22.784
Thank you, Victoire. These gentlemen

55:22.785 --> 55:24.288
are not here for tea.

55:29.311 --> 55:32.104
The YSL woman is free, but its elegance remains.

55:33.909 --> 55:36.189
Lace tunic, Chinese and black round.

55:36.523 --> 55:37.823
Long boots, covered.

55:39.147 --> 55:40.447
Where is Yvonne thought?

55:40.448 --> 55:42.198
Humiliate me in front of these Chinamen .

55:42.199 --> 55:43.649
Chinks are not, are Japanese.

55:43.650 --> 55:45.900
And they don’t come here to listen to your jokes.

55:47.081 --> 55:49.240
No, I was betrayed by my bad english.

55:50.928 --> 55:53.439
Of course I can ask him for a sum so.

55:53.825 --> 55:55.875
No, but even in English I can count.

55:56.299 --> 55:57.599
See you later.

55:58.639 --> 55:59.939
It's working?

56:00.392 --> 56:01.692
Why the face?

56:02.216 --> 56:03.516
You told him?

56:04.268 --> 56:05.918
- I told him what? 
- He is hateful.

56:05.919 --> 56:07.855
Tell him without telling me.

56:11.874 --> 56:13.174
Hello?

56:13.493 --> 56:16.356
Yeah, thanks for calling. Why signed without telling me?

56:17.259 --> 56:19.504
There is a phone. Why did not you call me?

56:23.754 --> 56:25.054
Thank you.

56:25.055 --> 56:26.610
The boots, please.

56:28.772 --> 56:30.449
And take off the tights too.

56:36.694 --> 56:37.994
Thank you.

56:37.995 --> 56:40.005
Trust is something that is given, thank you.

56:42.128 --> 56:43.929
I am forced to watch something?

56:46.515 --> 56:49.638
With that hair ... you look like a ragamuffin.

56:51.155 --> 56:54.505
How much vulgarity, poor thing. It's scary.

57:08.599 --> 57:10.721
- Victoire!
- Let her go. Leave.

57:13.624 --> 57:15.728
With this style of stevedore already ...

57:16.751 --> 57:18.051
She forgot.

57:25.208 --> 57:26.508
At work, girls.

57:37.746 --> 57:40.252
Death must be something ...

57:40.253 --> 57:42.603
A defect in inspiration.

57:45.233 --> 57:48.156
The few seasons that have passed were very tender.

57:49.674 --> 57:51.048
The world was changing.

57:51.573 --> 57:53.358
Only talks of Courèges.

57:53.686 --> 57:56.420
Chanel wanted to hire me. I said no, of course.

57:57.631 --> 57:59.838
I knew you would not surrender.

58:00.152 --> 58:01.764
Is stubborn

58:02.607 --> 58:05.111
and continues to invent.

59:53.172 --> 59:56.246
His collection "Riant Monde" was a move of genius.

59:56.868 --> 59:59.315
A dress has never been so copied.

01:00:00.361 --> 01:00:02.222
The owner of Charles of the Ritz

01:00:02.223 --> 01:00:04.623
bought out the U.S. Atlanta, U.S..

01:00:05.862 --> 01:00:08.290
It was the great beginning to our Maison.

01:01:00.264 --> 01:01:01.564
Waiter?

01:01:02.572 --> 01:01:03.872
Waiter, please!

01:01:08.881 --> 01:01:11.118
- I like you. 
- What?

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:15.807
He said he liked you, watching you dance.

01:01:16.658 --> 01:01:18.195
I think you're very beautiful.

01:01:18.822 --> 01:01:20.606
Very modern, very blonde.

01:01:24.959 --> 01:01:27.365
Do you agree to show my models?

01:01:29.794 --> 01:01:31.301
I’m Yves Saint Laurent.

01:01:33.908 --> 01:01:35.594
Here, please.

01:01:36.099 --> 01:01:38.407
- Here, please. 
- Turn here.

01:01:38.408 --> 01:01:39.708
Here.

01:01:41.088 --> 01:01:43.317
I do not intend to let me enclose

01:01:43.318 --> 01:01:45.618
the ivory tower of couture.

01:01:46.241 --> 01:01:47.571
I think the prêt-à-porter

01:01:47.572 --> 01:01:50.923
is an opening for everyday, life day to day.

01:01:50.924 --> 01:01:52.769
Intended for a category of people

01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:55.810
much broader and also more varied.

01:01:56.247 --> 01:01:58.547
Laurent, the veils on models of the collection,

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.220
Who designed them?

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:03.838
Well, just one person.

01:02:04.412 --> 01:02:05.962
Sir, I suppose.

01:02:05.963 --> 01:02:07.474
- Yes 
- Just opened

01:02:07.475 --> 01:02:10.249
its first store, which is the next step?

01:02:11.052 --> 01:02:13.303
I'd like to go, believe me ...

01:02:14.415 --> 01:02:17.331
Go away for a long time.

01:02:18.579 --> 01:02:20.721
And then come back one day and see if I ...

01:02:20.722 --> 01:02:22.956
yet I want to make dresses.

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:28.208
Stop drinking, you've overreacted.

01:02:28.209 --> 01:02:30.578
- I'm just. 
- No it's not.

01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:33.179
I have four collections per year, what are you going to do?

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.699
- I can not anymore, I'm tired. 
- But it was what he wanted.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:37.922
I did the rope to hang me

01:02:37.923 --> 01:02:40.321
and it is you who will pass it around my neck.

01:02:41.137 --> 01:02:43.613
What else do you want? He has everything and drinks like crazy.

01:02:43.614 --> 01:02:45.263
I do not understand what do you want?

01:02:46.933 --> 01:02:49.033
I just wanted to tell you that I miss you.

01:02:49.034 --> 01:02:50.334
That's it.

01:04:00.879 --> 01:04:03.683
In Marrakesh, you have found the light,

01:04:03.684 --> 01:04:06.794
new colors ... the streets,

01:04:07.231 --> 01:04:10.364
in walls, women clothing class.

01:04:14.408 --> 01:04:17.165
And maybe refound the scent of his youth.

01:04:25.389 --> 01:04:26.875
Hello, Tanita.

01:04:26.876 --> 01:04:28.631
I present my friend Loulou.

01:04:28.632 --> 01:04:30.842
Loulou de la Falaise, delighted.

01:04:30.843 --> 01:04:32.143
Delighted.

01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:34.089
Welcome.

01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:36.159
Your home is very beautiful.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.460
Thank you.

01:04:39.454 --> 01:04:41.015
These jewels are magnificent.

01:04:41.016 --> 01:04:43.139
I love that touch.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.695
- Where are they from? 
- From London.

01:04:46.813 --> 01:04:48.856
And it was me who did the.

01:04:48.857 --> 01:04:50.432
It's a bug

01:04:50.433 --> 01:04:52.625
giving laps around the Earth.

01:04:52.971 --> 01:04:55.151
I'm impressed. Did it myself?

01:04:55.152 --> 01:04:56.678
Made.

01:04:56.679 --> 01:04:57.979
Congratulations.

01:05:10.661 --> 01:05:11.961
Thank you.

01:05:12.343 --> 01:05:13.643
Here, try it.

01:05:13.644 --> 01:05:15.044
Go. Laurent is good sex.

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:16.964
Where are you taking me?

01:05:18.464 --> 01:05:19.764
Come, come.

01:05:19.765 --> 01:05:21.107
What are you doing?

01:05:21.108 --> 01:05:22.408
Secret meeting?

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:25.538
- What is it?
 - Try it.

01:05:25.539 --> 01:05:28.005
- It’s madjound . - What is madjound?

01:05:28.006 --> 01:05:30.303
Are dates, pistachios ...

01:05:30.998 --> 01:05:32.469
Go, try it.

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:34.453
Loulou experiment to experiment.

01:05:34.454 --> 01:05:36.403
- It was. 
- But you have to swallow.

01:05:39.222 --> 01:05:40.778
- Try, Yves. 
- I have bumped.

01:05:40.779 --> 01:05:42.280
You will see unicorns.

01:05:42.281 --> 01:05:44.927
- It's a sweet, does not hurt. 
- You'll see.

01:05:46.999 --> 01:05:48.388
Are you watching?

01:05:48.389 --> 01:05:49.750
- It's good. 
- I see.

01:05:49.751 --> 01:05:51.302
Goes down easy.

01:05:51.303 --> 01:05:53.545
Don’t be looking at me like that.

01:07:26.977 --> 01:07:28.477
- Who's Winning? 
- I am.

01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:30.593
- No, it's a lie. 
- Tadeh again.

01:07:30.594 --> 01:07:33.741
- No this game, is humiliating. 
- We'll see.

01:07:34.795 --> 01:07:36.493
Taken by assault by the army,

01:07:36.494 --> 01:07:37.808
burn the barricades.

01:07:38.891 --> 01:07:40.526
Where will it end?

01:07:41.389 --> 01:07:42.689
I do not know.

01:07:44.212 --> 01:07:46.579
If the left wins let us look bad.

01:07:47.141 --> 01:07:48.823
A shop in Rive Gauche ...

01:07:48.824 --> 01:07:51.651
Exactly, the shop closed, the neighborhood is blocked.

01:07:51.652 --> 01:07:54.697
I always saw my future as a financial catastrophe.

01:07:58.226 --> 01:08:00.907
And be for communism, which will, Yves?

01:08:01.506 --> 01:08:03.035
I will dress.

01:08:03.036 --> 01:08:05.056
And work uniforms.

01:08:05.057 --> 01:08:06.866
Also blouses,

01:08:06.867 --> 01:08:08.802
blouses,

01:08:08.803 --> 01:08:10.241
blouses and more.

01:08:10.242 --> 01:08:12.846
And especially sweaters. In the early years ...

01:08:14.439 --> 01:08:16.029
Your turn ...

01:08:16.029 --> 01:08:17.330
I get the winner.

01:08:21.406 --> 01:08:23.616
Your favorite heroines in real life?

01:08:24.163 --> 01:08:25.464
My mannequins.

01:08:26.404 --> 01:08:27.886
His favorite poet?

01:08:27.886 --> 01:08:31.205
- Pierre Berger. 
- That’s cute.

01:08:31.206 --> 01:08:33.080
Your ideal of happiness on earth?

01:08:33.939 --> 01:08:36.323
A large bed, full.

01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:40.785
What feature in MEN do you prefer?

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:42.959
The hair.

01:08:43.456 --> 01:08:44.756
And the woman?

01:08:44.756 --> 01:08:46.057
The hair also.

01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:50.919
It’s main feature?

01:08:52.158 --> 01:08:53.608
The kindness.

01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:54.908
The only, I'd say.

01:08:57.763 --> 01:09:00.425
The most enjoying in your friends?

01:09:01.053 --> 01:09:02.353
A joy.

01:09:04.398 --> 01:09:06.520
What would be your biggest regret?

01:09:09.210 --> 01:09:10.660
- Losing hair. 
- Maybe.

01:09:11.724 --> 01:09:14.087
It's true. Going bald.

01:09:14.948 --> 01:09:17.993
What natural gift would you like to have?

01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:21.555
Physical strength.

01:09:22.410 --> 01:09:24.421
How would you like to die?

01:09:25.496 --> 01:09:27.827
In my bed, well filled.

01:09:28.491 --> 01:09:30.832
What is now going through his head?

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:32.571
A risada.

01:09:33.781 --> 01:09:35.531
What is your favorite season of the year?

01:09:36.298 --> 01:09:38.484
I would say the spring.

01:09:38.486 --> 01:09:41.033
Agree. I love the month of May.

01:09:41.687 --> 01:09:42.987
I love it.

01:09:42.988 --> 01:09:44.714
For ended. We are in June.

01:09:45.733 --> 01:09:47.760
- See you next year. 
- Up there.

01:10:29.355 --> 01:10:32.376
With y”our Liberation" collection, you caused a scandal.

01:10:34.139 --> 01:10:37.733
Young woman wears YSL tuxedo like a challenge.

01:10:38.695 --> 01:10:40.674
Was more than equal to men,

01:10:40.675 --> 01:10:42.596
became his opponent.

01:10:44.481 --> 01:10:46.472
You took a liking to insolence.

01:10:46.473 --> 01:10:47.904
Mistreated bourgeois,

01:10:47.905 --> 01:10:49.715
was a social gesture,

01:10:49.716 --> 01:10:51.116
revolutionary.

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:54.124
And the revolution sold a lot.

01:10:55.143 --> 01:10:57.030
Swept all there was.

01:11:00.779 --> 01:11:03.748
You were magnificent as Christ is a superstar.

01:11:04.404 --> 01:11:06.918
The young seminarian had fallen behind.

01:11:17.851 --> 01:11:19.531
Hide me. Hide me!

01:11:34.282 --> 01:11:36.282
Stop talking, come dance a little.

01:11:36.283 --> 01:11:38.870
Goodbye, friends. I'm leaving.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:41.346
Tchau, dear.

01:11:41.912 --> 01:11:43.219
Tchau Pierre. Where are you going?

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:45.170
It fills me with bullshit. I'm coming.

01:11:45.171 --> 01:11:46.943
Just leaving this super party?

01:11:46.944 --> 01:11:49.346
Let the star in their anonymity.

01:11:49.347 --> 01:11:50.897
- Everything okay, Karl? 
- Hello, Pierre.

01:11:50.898 --> 01:11:52.974
I hear you're into bodybuilding, my goodness.

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:54.836
So that your thighs ache?

01:11:54.837 --> 01:11:56.137
What insolence!

01:12:01.392 --> 01:12:02.692
Karl?

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.073
YSL, this is Jacques de Bascher. My man.

01:12:11.646 --> 01:12:12.946
Nice to meet you.

01:12:14.735 --> 01:12:16.135
Why did Pierre left?

01:12:16.758 --> 01:12:19.134
I do not know. I'm going after him.

01:12:19.135 --> 01:12:20.435
Wait here.

01:12:23.233 --> 01:12:25.424
Mr. Laurent, please. A photo.

01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:27.459
No, please.

01:12:28.057 --> 01:12:29.889
Mr. Saint Laurent?

01:12:38.666 --> 01:12:40.816
- Have a cigarette, please? 
- Yes, of course.

01:12:43.455 --> 01:12:44.755
Recognized?

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:48.688
How cute your friend! Can I get?

01:13:05.376 --> 01:13:08.058
The worst is that your bullshit seen our advertising.

01:13:08.059 --> 01:13:10.827
Recomposed sales, Charles of the Ritz is happy.

01:13:11.832 --> 01:13:13.132
I do not know what came over me.

01:13:13.604 --> 01:13:14.904
I can not control myself.

01:13:16.314 --> 01:13:17.766
Only you can help me.

01:13:18.371 --> 01:13:19.671
You do not hear anyone.

01:13:20.478 --> 01:13:22.228
Yes, I hear you, I swear.

01:13:25.122 --> 01:13:26.439
What do you want me to do?

01:13:27.063 --> 01:13:30.063
If I surround himself with bodyguards, they will say I'm a tyrant.

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:31.882
A tyrant, I accept.

01:13:31.883 --> 01:13:34.637
A profiteer who found that abuse.

01:13:38.187 --> 01:13:39.800
Without you there would be nothing.

01:13:40.643 --> 01:13:41.943
You are a genius, Yves.

01:13:43.297 --> 01:13:45.779
You would be successful anyway.

01:13:49.534 --> 01:13:50.834
This does not justify.

01:13:56.003 --> 01:13:58.184
You had the genius.

01:13:58.185 --> 01:14:00.859
I just knew you follow.

01:14:01.477 --> 01:14:03.658
And despite everything that happened between us,

01:14:03.659 --> 01:14:06.326
this pact has never been disrespected.

01:14:08.994 --> 01:14:11.544
"He belonged to that great, magnificent and pitiful

01:14:11.545 --> 01:14:13.840
family of unbalanced,

01:14:13.841 --> 01:14:15.923
which is the salt of the earth.

01:14:17.174 --> 01:14:20.185
All we have is good brought by imbalanced.

01:14:21.018 --> 01:14:22.550
They are and not others,

01:14:22.551 --> 01:14:24.173
who founded religions

01:14:24.174 --> 01:14:25.984
and composed great works.

01:14:26.742 --> 01:14:29.663
Never know what the world owes them

01:14:30.607 --> 01:14:33.455
and especially what they suffered to achieve. "

01:14:34.422 --> 01:14:36.448
This is music in your ears, isn’t it?

01:14:37.533 --> 01:14:39.853
You have consulted a psychiatrist in 15th.

01:14:39.854 --> 01:14:41.410
I noted on your schedule.

01:14:43.191 --> 01:14:44.755
Is it for Sr. Saint Laurent.

01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:47.572
No, it’s not for anyone.

01:14:48.614 --> 01:14:49.914
I got this.

01:14:52.146 --> 01:14:54.776
Before, Loulou, I had confidence in you.

01:14:54.777 --> 01:14:57.127
I forbid you to bring drugs to Yves. Piss off.

01:14:57.128 --> 01:14:59.697
Pierre, he asked me to work with him.

01:15:03.565 --> 01:15:04.865
Work?

01:15:05.792 --> 01:15:08.366
You can not isolate him so he has friends.

01:15:09.124 --> 01:15:11.052
There are victims and executioners.

01:15:11.053 --> 01:15:13.336
Here we have victims and executioners.

01:15:15.517 --> 01:15:17.438
I ask you to empty your pockets

01:15:19.438 --> 01:15:20.738
and go there to see his friend.

01:15:22.922 --> 01:15:24.472
Give him more care.

01:15:28.453 --> 01:15:30.640
They are all looking over here for the picture!

01:15:31.105 --> 01:15:32.405
That, Brigitte.

01:15:32.904 --> 01:15:34.304
Youngest, smiling.

01:15:34.305 --> 01:15:35.963
We are happy with the meeting.

01:15:37.136 --> 01:15:38.436
Perfect!

01:15:38.437 --> 01:15:39.737
One more?

01:15:40.263 --> 01:15:42.508
- Along with my son. 
- Yes, of course.

01:15:42.509 --> 01:15:44.545
Love smiles.

01:15:45.059 --> 01:15:46.579
Fantastic.

01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:48.878
- Congratulations. 
- Thank you, Pierre.

01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:51.326
Three months ago I do not see my son.

01:15:51.327 --> 01:15:52.977
You push all who enjoy it.

01:15:52.978 --> 01:15:54.828
Send the photo to you, Lucienne.

01:15:55.133 --> 01:15:56.571
How dare you?

01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:59.133
Santa, how will your business?

01:16:00.073 --> 01:16:01.373
They are closed.

01:16:01.987 --> 01:16:04.537
I closed it, I'm not so good at business.

01:16:04.538 --> 01:16:07.145
I'm at the beach, for me is enough.

01:16:08.224 --> 01:16:10.741
- Do you miss Algeria? 
- I do.

01:16:13.613 --> 01:16:15.707
I have not yet thanked you for the car.

01:16:16.704 --> 01:16:19.267
- What car? 
- The one you gave me.

01:16:21.738 --> 01:16:23.038
It's a Fiat.

01:16:24.656 --> 01:16:27.023
- Do you like it? 
- Yes, of course.

01:16:27.774 --> 01:16:30.225
- Very much. 
- This is better.

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:44.815
What it is about?

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:49.970
Charles!

01:17:18.026 --> 01:17:20.276
- Stop it, Charles! 
- Come here!

01:17:20.277 --> 01:17:21.577
Here!

01:17:29.694 --> 01:17:31.552
Lawrence of Arabia.

01:17:46.711 --> 01:17:49.479
Jacques, stop humiliating his cousin.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.341
You like that, Karl.

01:17:51.342 --> 01:17:52.642
Liar, will.

01:17:53.379 --> 01:17:54.679
Wow, finally.

01:17:58.951 --> 01:18:00.701
Jesus and Mary.

01:18:02.962 --> 01:18:04.262
Bravo!

01:18:40.605 --> 01:18:42.446
You think I'm a lost?

01:18:42.903 --> 01:18:45.489
No, I would call ...

01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:46.790
A whore.

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.528
Lost is ... It's very old fashioned.

01:18:50.529 --> 01:18:52.051
I'm old fashioned.

01:18:52.052 --> 01:18:53.884
So it is all explained.

01:18:57.122 --> 01:18:59.474
You cost a fortune to Karl, is not it?

01:19:04.414 --> 01:19:06.101
Karl my devil.

01:19:06.102 --> 01:19:08.652
I give you as a token of my admiration.

01:19:10.575 --> 01:19:12.453
No, I refuse to accept me.

01:19:53.613 --> 01:19:56.647
Marrakesh had no longer the same brightness for us.

01:19:57.798 --> 01:19:59.802
I was there, followed you.

01:19:59.803 --> 01:20:02.451
Trying to help you, protect you.

01:20:04.023 --> 01:20:06.364
Protect you from everything.

01:20:06.749 --> 01:20:08.583
Perhaps too much.

01:20:23.101 --> 01:20:25.101
You do not need to give me so many gifts.

01:20:25.561 --> 01:20:26.873
No need to buy me.

01:20:26.874 --> 01:20:28.961
It was a bad habit I acquired.

01:20:28.962 --> 01:20:32.012
Do not send me any more these weights, I do not know where to keep them.

01:20:32.625 --> 01:20:34.352
I'd rather see you every day.

01:20:54.902 --> 01:20:56.423
You are the only man

01:20:56.424 --> 01:20:58.207
I want to grow old, you know?

01:20:59.075 --> 01:21:01.587
You say the same to Karl.

01:21:03.408 --> 01:21:05.108
I bank with him the Joker.

01:21:05.643 --> 01:21:07.362
It's a comfortable situation.

01:21:10.592 --> 01:21:12.358
But you worry me.

01:21:15.121 --> 01:21:17.086
Scare me.

01:21:23.055 --> 01:21:25.201
When we love, we are in danger.

01:21:25.604 --> 01:21:27.592
That's what I like.

01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:07.492
Chord!

01:23:10.215 --> 01:23:11.515
Open your eyes!

01:23:11.516 --> 01:23:12.816
Look at me.

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.660
No sleep again.

01:23:15.252 --> 01:23:16.552
Chord!

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:22.326
- I woke up. - Really?

01:23:22.327 --> 01:23:23.768
Yes.

01:23:23.769 --> 01:23:25.157
Stop it!

01:23:26.094 --> 01:23:27.644
I agreed.

01:23:37.022 --> 01:23:38.322
Why do it?

01:23:40.696 --> 01:23:42.521
Is he offended?

01:23:44.963 --> 01:23:46.707
He likes you as well?

01:23:51.076 --> 01:23:52.780
I think he nice.

01:23:55.608 --> 01:23:57.153
Elegant.

01:23:59.122 --> 01:24:00.753
He has a beautiful body.

01:24:02.776 --> 01:24:04.232
He is charming.

01:24:28.068 --> 01:24:29.368
I love him.

01:24:32.221 --> 01:24:33.937
But the man in my life is you.

01:24:58.911 --> 01:25:00.211
Thank you.

01:26:07.263 --> 01:26:08.793
Jacques de Bascher saved

01:26:08.794 --> 01:26:11.230
the secret of our meeting until death.

01:26:11.884 --> 01:26:13.184
He did it right.

01:26:14.126 --> 01:26:16.198
I may not have principles,

01:26:16.199 --> 01:26:18.123
but I have word.

01:26:55.713 --> 01:26:57.301
Hey, Jacques, it’s me.

01:27:05.568 --> 01:27:06.868
Why?

01:27:13.627 --> 01:27:16.179
You bastard! What did you do?

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:17.839
What did I do?

01:27:33.827 --> 01:27:35.127
- Good evening.
 - Hello

01:27:35.578 --> 01:27:37.024
So, where are we going?

01:27:37.025 --> 01:27:38.907
- For the revelry. 
- End of night.

01:27:38.908 --> 01:27:40.208
Not a big deal.

01:27:40.209 --> 01:27:41.509
I'll look for my windbreaker.

01:27:42.482 --> 01:27:43.950
Stand up and get out there.

01:27:44.394 --> 01:27:46.319
Go! Get out! Get out.

01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:48.280
Go.

01:27:50.817 --> 01:27:52.314
You will not leave.

01:27:52.315 --> 01:27:53.615
I will not leave?

01:27:56.979 --> 01:27:58.279
I will not leave?

01:27:59.448 --> 01:28:00.748
No?

01:28:00.749 --> 01:28:02.326
You're a loser!

01:28:02.327 --> 01:28:03.627
It is a parasite.

01:28:08.628 --> 01:28:09.991
You bastard!

01:29:03.417 --> 01:29:04.717
Salumah?

01:29:07.038 --> 01:29:08.338
Salumah?

01:29:08.339 --> 01:29:10.131
My medications?

01:29:17.596 --> 01:29:18.896
Alright.

01:29:18.897 --> 01:29:20.315
I found.

01:29:22.079 --> 01:29:23.590
Runaway… Worm…

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:25.542
- Okay? - I need to design yet.

01:29:32.819 --> 01:29:34.517
Hello! Okay?

01:29:34.518 --> 01:29:35.831
All right, sir?

01:29:57.356 --> 01:30:00.382
You entered the illness as one comes into a religion.

01:30:01.464 --> 01:30:04.694
But used his last strength to prepare their collections.

01:30:05.868 --> 01:30:08.453
You just got happy twice a year.

01:30:08.454 --> 01:30:11.458
In the spring ... and fall.

01:30:31.222 --> 01:30:32.839
Instead, dear.

01:30:59.751 --> 01:31:01.051
Anne Marie?

01:31:01.052 --> 01:31:03.602
Why is the model wearing a green coat?

01:31:03.603 --> 01:31:05.227
She is the fourth and another?

01:31:05.228 --> 01:31:07.357
I do not know. I am not responsible for the order.

01:31:07.358 --> 01:31:10.034
Jean Pierre? Why are addressing this here

01:31:10.035 --> 01:31:12.435
- Iva and is not ready? - Here is reversed,

01:31:12.436 --> 01:31:13.986
the mantle is the second, and ...

01:31:14.304 --> 01:31:16.434
- Sandrine? - Mr. Saint Laurent designed it

01:31:16.435 --> 01:31:17.902
After the cocktail dresses.

01:31:17.903 --> 01:31:19.203
Sure.

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:26.808
Let's find out why.

01:31:36.008 --> 01:31:37.308
Okay, Loulou.

01:31:50.942 --> 01:31:53.161
Pretty much it. Very elegant.

01:31:56.263 --> 01:31:58.392
Very well. Thank you.

01:32:01.068 --> 01:32:02.638
Okay, ladies and gentlemen ...

01:32:02.639 --> 01:32:05.307
The show will start. Move, move, move.

01:32:09.868 --> 01:32:11.168
All ready?

01:33:28.695 --> 01:33:30.135
Certo, Magali.

01:33:36.548 --> 01:33:38.598
You, wait.

01:35:30.765 --> 01:35:34.815
- Yves? Okay? - Yeah, all right.

01:35:48.401 --> 01:35:49.701
Come on, girl.

01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:57.610
Come on, go.

01:36:25.328 --> 01:36:26.778
Go thank, are waiting.

01:37:31.416 --> 01:37:32.716
Thank you.

01:38:19.885 --> 01:38:21.185
Pierre?

01:38:26.413 --> 01:38:27.820
I'm here, Yves.

01:38:47.051 --> 01:38:48.587
So cute.
