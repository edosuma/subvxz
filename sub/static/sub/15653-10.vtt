WEBVTT

00:04.387 --> 00:07.826
We got one rent-a-cop
just inside the door,

00:07.858 --> 00:10.001
another guarding the safe,

00:10.660 --> 00:13.363
and one wandering around
like he gives a shit.

00:13.397 --> 00:15.200
I bet we only have to break
one of their noses

00:15.232 --> 00:17.701
before the other two slide
their pieces across the floor.

00:17.735 --> 00:20.637
- Then you do your thing.
- And what thing is that?

00:20.671 --> 00:22.474
The thing where you crack the safe.

00:22.506 --> 00:25.576
Ah, right. I like that thing.

00:25.610 --> 00:27.445
So you ready?

00:28.578 --> 00:29.714
Yep. Ready.

00:29.747 --> 00:32.316
- Are we gonna say it?
- Say what?

00:33.618 --> 00:34.819
Ah.

00:35.345 --> 00:37.622
Here's to getting rich and fat.

00:37.654 --> 00:40.258
And dyin' in the arms
of a beautiful woman.

00:48.566 --> 00:51.066
- Jesus.
- She's barely got a pulse.

00:51.805 --> 00:53.737
Wait a second. Where...

00:53.770 --> 00:55.572
- Where is she?
- She took off.

00:55.605 --> 00:56.975
To the Gate.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.377
Look, she's gonna open it
if we don't stop her.

01:02.646 --> 01:05.498
- Kate, can you hear me?
- I gotta get 'em outta here.

01:05.572 --> 01:06.687
Somebody's gotta make sure Ama...

01:06.712 --> 01:09.376
I'll find Richard. I'll find somebody.

01:09.409 --> 01:10.939
Just... just go.

01:11.310 --> 01:13.523
- You sure?
- Aren't you?

01:23.922 --> 01:26.625
Hey. Something's happenin'.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.229
It's the gate, isn't it?

01:36.165 --> 01:38.668
You're Xibalban. How do I close it?

01:40.669 --> 01:44.506
I beat you in a fair fight. Tell me.

01:44.540 --> 01:46.642
It's a sunny day.

01:47.381 --> 01:48.783
Fine.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.120
Thank you, gods.

02:36.158 --> 02:37.762
Did you feel that?

02:37.856 --> 02:39.626
No. What is it?

02:39.658 --> 02:41.194
It's begun.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.862
What's begun?

02:43.862 --> 02:45.489
A new age.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.703
_

02:49.735 --> 02:53.274
Do you know how long
she's waited for this?

02:55.342 --> 02:57.978
Now she walks in her own skin,

02:58.010 --> 03:00.614
Queen of the Underworld.

03:00.646 --> 03:03.349
Soon to be the Queen of our world.

03:03.383 --> 03:07.521
Tlalticpac, the realm of light,

03:07.554 --> 03:11.758
will be consumed
by the realm of shadows.

03:11.790 --> 03:13.526
All she has to do...

03:14.693 --> 03:16.563
is let it in.

04:27.567 --> 04:28.869
Oh, man.

05:07.072 --> 05:08.908
It's a goddamn mess.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.911
Here! Wrap her wrists.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.646
Dude, she already lost too much blood.

05:12.678 --> 05:13.913
She's gonna lose a lot more
if you don't hurry up.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.348
Okay? Wrap!

05:16.415 --> 05:18.117
Shit. Her pulse is weak.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.086
So where the fuck is the blood supply?!

05:20.120 --> 05:21.754
- It's gone.
- Gone where?

05:21.788 --> 05:23.055
Burt fucked us over. It's gone!

05:23.088 --> 05:24.925
What do you mean, he fucked us...

05:27.026 --> 05:29.362
Take this.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.064
We can't do that. What if...
what if you're not her blood type?

05:31.096 --> 05:33.533
Then it's gonna be a very
short transfusion, all right?

05:43.108 --> 05:44.644
- Stick her.
- I don't know if...

05:44.677 --> 05:46.914
- Stick her!
- Fuck.

05:58.057 --> 06:01.161
Our Father who art in heaven...

06:01.194 --> 06:04.398
Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done...

06:04.430 --> 06:08.067
Thy Will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven...

06:12.172 --> 06:14.107
Ah, fuck it.

06:14.139 --> 06:16.142
No atheists in foxholes.

06:16.175 --> 06:17.777
...for Thine is the kingdom,

06:17.810 --> 06:21.080
and the power, and the glory forever.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.719
The legendary brothers.

07:33.752 --> 07:36.555
Why do you insist
on trying to be a hero?

07:36.588 --> 07:39.158
It's not just me and my brother anymore.

07:40.192 --> 07:41.760
I know.

07:41.793 --> 07:43.729
Oh, believe me, I know.

07:44.863 --> 07:47.099
You're all gonna save the world.

07:48.166 --> 07:50.269
Well, it's too late.

07:50.302 --> 07:51.838
This is the end.

07:53.673 --> 07:55.875
I am the end.

07:55.908 --> 07:59.079
And the girl... is dead.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.713
Kate?

08:04.317 --> 08:06.552
Welcome home, Richard.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.555
And welcome to slavery.

08:10.557 --> 08:12.441
That twisted mind of yours.

08:13.158 --> 08:15.578
That lovely, twisted mind...

08:16.353 --> 08:18.231
is gonna help me spread the good news.

08:32.879 --> 08:34.080
They're not gonna fight this war.

08:34.113 --> 08:35.682
This is not their fight.

08:35.715 --> 08:36.884
It's everyone's.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.120
Trust me.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.788
And most definitely yours.

08:42.822 --> 08:44.124
Diosa.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.926
Gracias.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.259
How can we repay you?

08:47.293 --> 08:50.797
I am not your diosa...
and don't thank me

08:50.830 --> 08:53.266
until I get you out of here alive.

08:53.298 --> 08:55.302
We're gonna be sure to make that...

09:02.674 --> 09:05.311
To the tunnels. Go! Go.

09:13.986 --> 09:15.621
What's happening?

09:20.025 --> 09:21.727
Stop this!

10:00.327 --> 10:03.464
Mags?! Mags, what's wrong?!

10:03.497 --> 10:04.665
Hold on!

10:09.737 --> 10:12.040
You have a choice. You've just
got to listen to me.

10:14.443 --> 10:17.746
- Amaru is our Queen!
- I am your queen!

10:27.456 --> 10:29.225
She is a false idol.

10:31.693 --> 10:33.261
You're nothing to her.

10:35.396 --> 10:40.368
I am one of you,
and I will fight for you.

10:51.579 --> 10:52.614
What happened?

10:53.682 --> 10:55.351
It's over.

10:56.650 --> 10:58.520
That bitch.

11:15.236 --> 11:17.338
Kate, do you know where you're at?

11:30.885 --> 11:32.520
Oh, God!

11:32.553 --> 11:34.589
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Hey.

11:34.622 --> 11:36.592
Come on.

11:36.625 --> 11:39.227
Let's sit you right here.

11:39.260 --> 11:41.195
She's going to do it to everyone.

11:41.228 --> 11:42.263
Do what?

11:43.731 --> 11:46.201
She's gonna take our souls.

11:46.765 --> 11:48.670
Okay, listen to me.

11:48.702 --> 11:51.339
You get her to the ridge, you
find a car, and you drive

11:51.372 --> 11:53.541
as far away from here as you can,
as fast as you can, all right?

11:53.574 --> 11:55.743
- I'm not going.
- Kate, listen to me.

11:55.776 --> 11:58.446
- Stop! No!
- It's not safe here.

11:58.911 --> 12:00.716
I can't. Please.

12:02.350 --> 12:04.520
I remember everything.

12:05.720 --> 12:09.491
All the souls, every single life I took.

12:09.524 --> 12:11.739
She made me watch all of it...

12:12.394 --> 12:14.666
especially when she tried to kill you.

12:15.362 --> 12:18.433
I cannot just walk away.

12:20.501 --> 12:21.770
None of us can.

12:28.242 --> 12:29.577
Kate...

12:31.513 --> 12:32.681
is that you?

12:32.713 --> 12:34.415
I'm so sorry.

12:34.732 --> 12:37.618
I didn't... I couldn't stop her.

12:38.099 --> 12:39.521
It's not your fault.

12:43.258 --> 12:45.961
Where's Carlito? What happened?

12:46.785 --> 12:48.697
He left as soon as the Gate opened.

12:51.356 --> 12:52.635
Where's Richard?

12:53.702 --> 12:54.913
I mean, you guys...

12:56.237 --> 12:58.094
you got some thing, right?

12:59.773 --> 13:01.274
Picking up any signals or anything?

13:06.152 --> 13:07.321
Where's the rest of 'em?

13:11.062 --> 13:12.756
She made them kill each other.

13:14.990 --> 13:18.777
She enslaved us... for centuries,

13:18.810 --> 13:21.797
and... now she's
just using us as puppets.

13:21.829 --> 13:24.365
She doesn't just consume souls,

13:24.399 --> 13:26.928
she manipulates them.

13:29.670 --> 13:32.273
So, as long as that Gate's open,

13:32.307 --> 13:34.875
she's gonna get control
of more and more of us.

13:34.909 --> 13:37.980
- The Gate's her power.
- So we close it.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.781
How do we do that?

13:40.814 --> 13:42.984
You use me.

13:43.018 --> 13:44.686
- What?
- If I can get down there,

13:44.718 --> 13:46.754
I can close the Gate. I know I can.

13:46.788 --> 13:48.789
Bullshit. She's gonna be
standing right next to it.

13:48.822 --> 13:49.958
No.

13:51.393 --> 13:53.339
She won't be.

13:55.529 --> 13:57.598
Trust me.

13:57.631 --> 13:59.534
She won't be.

14:02.437 --> 14:04.740
Stop hiding.

14:04.773 --> 14:07.943
Hiding? From you?

14:08.211 --> 14:10.485
The entire world knows that I'm here.

14:11.771 --> 14:13.815
So come out and face me.

14:14.652 --> 14:15.883
I want to show you

14:15.917 --> 14:18.979
what a real queen looks like.

14:25.460 --> 14:28.664
Send me your death.
Send me your plagues.

14:28.697 --> 14:31.866
Send me your hordes. Send me your death.

14:31.899 --> 14:34.370
Send me your plagues.

14:37.639 --> 14:40.709
Send me your death. Send me your hordes.

14:40.741 --> 14:43.812
Send me your death.
Send me your plagues.

14:43.845 --> 14:45.714
Send me your hordes.

14:52.973 --> 14:54.241
Tell me what happened.

14:54.266 --> 14:55.935
Amaru did something to her.

15:06.774 --> 15:08.143
I'm gonna need you to wait here.

15:22.945 --> 15:24.479
Ah, fuck.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.313
Any sign of him?

15:34.095 --> 15:35.096
No.

15:35.903 --> 15:37.553
He could still be alive...

15:38.399 --> 15:39.568
With her.

15:41.569 --> 15:43.305
Do we really have
to go through that town?

15:43.338 --> 15:45.373
The only way to get to the mine.

15:48.843 --> 15:50.445
You know, you don't
have to do this alone.

15:50.478 --> 15:51.781
Yes, I do.

15:52.948 --> 15:54.728
She killed the woman that I love.

15:55.816 --> 15:57.418
She dies today.

15:57.452 --> 15:58.889
Hey.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.556
See you on the Other Side.

16:01.589 --> 16:03.692
I think we're already there.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.562
Come on.

17:02.241 --> 17:04.711
Whoa. Easy, easy, easy.

17:04.744 --> 17:06.479
Scott, you go ahead.

17:09.248 --> 17:12.486
Seth, can you just stop
trying to protect me?

17:12.518 --> 17:15.588
-Can you give it a rest, please.
-Listen to me.

17:15.621 --> 17:18.057
I am going to do the one thing
that I couldn't do

17:18.090 --> 17:20.526
while she was controlling me,
I'm going to stop her.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.364
Well, we need to get you there
in one piece, all right?

17:36.610 --> 17:38.312
Come on, go!

17:47.687 --> 17:48.990
Scott!

17:50.423 --> 17:53.059
Hey, hey, hey! No.

17:59.432 --> 18:00.975
Where the hell have you been?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.228
Well, that's one
funny way of putting it.

18:04.804 --> 18:08.307
I am tired of your bullshit, Carlos.

18:08.341 --> 18:10.644
When I was in the Labyrinth,

18:10.677 --> 18:13.046
I confronted something that no man,

18:13.080 --> 18:14.515
or woman,

18:14.547 --> 18:16.449
should ever have to face alone.

18:16.483 --> 18:17.685
Oh, really.

18:18.852 --> 18:20.187
What is that?

18:20.219 --> 18:21.521
A dead end.

18:23.223 --> 18:24.525
Getting backed into a corner

18:24.557 --> 18:26.278
shows you a lot about yourself.

18:26.826 --> 18:28.761
I failed the test.

18:28.795 --> 18:31.131
I made a deal with the devil.

18:31.519 --> 18:33.232
And now you want out.

18:33.266 --> 18:36.503
No. I want to win.

18:36.535 --> 18:38.439
I want all of us to win.

18:39.506 --> 18:41.409
They gave me great power...

18:42.609 --> 18:44.879
but I can't fight them...

18:47.546 --> 18:49.513
because I am a part of them.

18:50.778 --> 18:53.621
You have to fight, mi reina.

18:54.154 --> 18:56.590
You have to finish what we started.

18:59.692 --> 19:01.261
Break the chains.

19:03.295 --> 19:04.832
Break the chains.

19:13.873 --> 19:15.441
Scott?

19:15.475 --> 19:16.644
Shh.

19:45.205 --> 19:46.406
Aah!

19:56.416 --> 19:57.518
Scott!

20:02.221 --> 20:03.723
Come on.

20:34.787 --> 20:36.754
What are you doing here?
I told you to keep with the others.

20:36.787 --> 20:38.191
We belong to you now, mi diosa.

20:38.225 --> 20:40.327
- You don't belong to anyone.
- Then we choose to fight!

20:47.667 --> 20:49.602
Wrong choice.

21:36.349 --> 21:39.519
Did your old girlfriend,
your dead girlfriend,

21:39.552 --> 21:40.754
teach you how to fight?

21:45.859 --> 21:47.427
I learned a long time ago.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.709
Is that all you got?

22:09.381 --> 22:11.551
They don't call me
Pandemonium for nothing.

22:13.018 --> 22:14.987
What's the matter?

22:15.021 --> 22:16.991
Can't quite spread your wings?

22:20.392 --> 22:22.496
The winged serpent.

22:22.528 --> 22:26.299
Here, let me help you take flight.

22:35.007 --> 22:36.744
She's alive.

22:43.016 --> 22:44.817
Aw, come on, you runt bastard.

23:23.122 --> 23:24.824
What the hell?

23:28.093 --> 23:30.817
You're gonna let that bitch
kill your vibe, bro?

23:31.631 --> 23:32.632
What?

23:33.833 --> 23:36.109
Are you going to stay there forever?

23:37.117 --> 23:39.386
What the hell are you talking about?

24:07.801 --> 24:10.077
It's a maze out there.

24:10.804 --> 24:12.973
Well, you made it to the end.

24:13.706 --> 24:15.809
Welcome to hell's asshole.

24:17.142 --> 24:19.179
That's not the way out.

24:20.913 --> 24:23.383
I need you to help me close this thing.

24:25.185 --> 24:26.720
Tanner?

24:28.220 --> 24:30.457
- Tanner?
- What? Yeah.

24:30.489 --> 24:32.726
What, yeah, what can I, uh...

24:32.758 --> 24:35.027
How can I help you?

24:37.663 --> 24:38.998
Translate.

24:42.134 --> 24:45.805
I think this
is how we close the gate.

24:59.619 --> 25:00.821
She's coming.

25:00.853 --> 25:02.855
Then let's get moving.

25:37.145 --> 25:38.247
Baby?

25:39.615 --> 25:40.950
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:40.984 --> 25:42.452
You okay?

25:42.485 --> 25:44.121
Thirsty.

25:48.770 --> 25:50.405
Ferdinand?

25:50.439 --> 25:52.374
- Huh?
- Water.

26:03.286 --> 26:06.722
Just tell me one thing. Is it over?

26:06.756 --> 26:08.490
It's not over. We gotta go.

26:08.524 --> 26:10.392
Come on, get up, now!

26:19.178 --> 26:20.447
Come on!

26:46.328 --> 26:48.697
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

27:00.595 --> 27:03.332
You guys, here! Quick, quick!

27:10.138 --> 27:12.133
All right, last one.

27:12.574 --> 27:14.844
Looks like Dr. Frank-N-Furter.

27:14.876 --> 27:16.278
Big Headdress.

27:18.846 --> 27:21.116
Sounds like the word for "lord."

27:21.150 --> 27:23.786
All right, well, come on, come on, man.
What's the word?

27:24.920 --> 27:26.288
Tanner?

27:27.756 --> 27:31.560
You know, Richie, we don't belong here.

27:31.593 --> 27:33.629
We belong over there!

27:59.553 --> 28:00.555
Thanks.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.065
Finish.

28:03.192 --> 28:04.759
Yeah.

28:04.793 --> 28:06.929
I don't know the word for lord.

28:06.961 --> 28:08.631
Ajaw.

28:10.265 --> 28:11.667
Eh...

28:11.700 --> 28:12.869
Here goes.

28:19.575 --> 28:21.544
Whoa, whoa!

28:25.220 --> 28:26.835
Richie! Richie?

28:28.370 --> 28:30.039
No. No!

28:30.219 --> 28:31.353
Aah!

28:31.385 --> 28:32.821
Aah!

28:33.888 --> 28:35.757
We're at Butte Memorial.

28:35.790 --> 28:37.492
Call in all the rapid
response teams we got.

28:37.526 --> 28:39.728
I've gotta get out there.
The others need my help.

28:39.760 --> 28:40.796
Right, be...

28:40.828 --> 28:42.697
Ohh.

28:42.730 --> 28:44.299
I'll be fine, just go.

28:44.333 --> 28:45.768
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.236
-For bringing this all in our lives.
-Okay.

28:48.269 --> 28:50.838
And for pushing you and Billy
away when I know you needed me.

28:50.872 --> 28:52.341
Freddie, look out!

29:06.855 --> 29:09.194
Jesus Chri... are you okay?

29:09.257 --> 29:10.558
- I'm fine.
- Let me see.

29:10.583 --> 29:13.519
I just can't... heal anymore.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.713
Yeah, well, just...
let me help you, all right?

29:15.738 --> 29:16.892
- You've lost a lot of...
- I'm fine.

29:16.944 --> 29:18.580
You've lost enough blood, all right?

29:24.373 --> 29:27.009
You shouldn't even be here.

29:27.041 --> 29:28.910
Then where should I be?

29:30.098 --> 29:32.534
I don't know. Prom or something.

29:34.383 --> 29:36.318
Dancing with some Jesus freak.

29:37.719 --> 29:40.523
Singing in your church
choir, I don't know.

29:42.557 --> 29:44.920
Nah. That's the girl you should've been.

29:44.945 --> 29:47.314
Yeah, well, that girl is long gone.

29:49.604 --> 29:52.374
You had a gun pointed
right to my head...

29:53.734 --> 29:55.344
and you didn't pull the trigger.

29:56.425 --> 29:59.165
I've done some very messed-up
things in my life.

29:59.740 --> 30:04.046
I'll be the first
to admit that. But you...

30:04.078 --> 30:06.749
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

30:06.781 --> 30:08.616
So this is my fault,

30:08.650 --> 30:10.845
because I didn't put
a bullet between your eyes?

30:15.856 --> 30:19.694
I could always count on
Seth Gecko to make the tough call.

30:19.728 --> 30:21.397
And you're gonna have to make one now.

30:21.430 --> 30:22.698
What are you talking about?

30:22.730 --> 30:24.700
Amaru is still a part of me.

30:24.732 --> 30:27.568
She's in there, I can feel her.

30:27.602 --> 30:30.496
So, when I walk through that Gate,
it's gonna close.

30:31.365 --> 30:34.536
Xibalba will be welcoming home
its long-lost queen.

30:36.978 --> 30:38.614
She knows that.
That's why she's trying to...

30:38.646 --> 30:40.915
No, you can't walk
through the Gate to close it.

30:40.949 --> 30:42.918
That is suicide. No way.

30:42.951 --> 30:44.819
That's the only way.

30:56.731 --> 30:57.833
Scott!

31:37.825 --> 31:40.694
Come on, Richard, get up.

31:41.861 --> 31:43.604
Or take your time.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.835
How'd you get out here?

31:47.867 --> 31:51.071
Don't ask the questions.
Be the guy with the answers.

31:52.673 --> 31:54.642
You know, a pastor friend of mine said,

31:54.675 --> 31:57.212
I got a little Lucifer in me.

31:58.980 --> 32:00.781
You got a little Lucifer in you, too.

32:02.282 --> 32:03.284
Always have.

32:07.253 --> 32:09.156
Ever since you robbed that liquor
store with your brother,

32:09.190 --> 32:11.993
heard those voices...

32:14.361 --> 32:15.896
saw those demons.

32:18.799 --> 32:20.635
You're sayin' I'm part Xibalban?

32:20.667 --> 32:23.670
I'm saying you're
the best in the West. Huh?

32:23.703 --> 32:25.138
The Notorious D.O. Double-G.

32:25.172 --> 32:26.708
Billy the motherfuckin' Kid.

32:26.741 --> 32:29.711
And when the sun comes out
from behind that moon,

32:29.743 --> 32:31.713
you got one job and one job only,

32:31.745 --> 32:34.848
and that is to save tu hermanito.

32:42.223 --> 32:44.059
Or it all goes down the drain.

32:52.265 --> 32:54.101
Scott!

32:54.135 --> 32:55.636
Scott!

32:55.669 --> 32:57.104
You're just gonna have
to let me die, Kate.

32:58.271 --> 33:00.241
Scott!

33:00.273 --> 33:02.877
You know what I love to do to culebras?

33:05.413 --> 33:08.883
String 'em up in the sun,
just to watch them burn.

33:08.915 --> 33:10.917
Let the kid go, you twisted bitch.

33:10.951 --> 33:12.654
If I were you,

33:12.686 --> 33:15.155
I'd be more concerned
about my own brother than hers.

33:17.425 --> 33:19.159
What the fuck did you do to him?

33:19.193 --> 33:22.030
He's on the Other Side.
Where he belongs,

33:22.062 --> 33:23.363
ready to serve.

33:23.396 --> 33:26.134
You will all get your chance to serve.

33:42.782 --> 33:44.084
Make it stop!

33:44.117 --> 33:45.953
You can make it stop.

33:45.985 --> 33:48.022
You're just gonna
have to surrender to me.

33:50.991 --> 33:52.127
Surrender?

33:53.461 --> 33:55.163
Why not just kill me?

33:57.764 --> 33:59.733
You can't, can you?

34:02.869 --> 34:04.833
It's 'cause I'm a part of you.

34:06.773 --> 34:08.676
We're inseparable.

34:13.848 --> 34:16.083
Not if I walk through to the Other Side.

34:18.018 --> 34:21.054
I'll be gone forever.
And you'll be powerless.

34:21.087 --> 34:22.277
Kate.

34:25.326 --> 34:28.862
One more step, and I pop your knees.

34:28.895 --> 34:30.764
I have a better idea.

34:32.132 --> 34:35.402
Take another step...
and your brother dies.

34:37.771 --> 34:39.940
You won't just be killing him, no.

34:39.974 --> 34:42.409
You'll be sentencing
Mr. Gecko to his death.

34:42.442 --> 34:45.145
Let the bitch kill me, Kate.
I don't give a fuck...

34:47.447 --> 34:50.018
Kate, don't do this.

34:53.820 --> 34:55.422
But how could I not?

34:55.940 --> 34:57.759
You brought them all together.

34:57.791 --> 35:01.094
Those thieves and those... bloodsuckers.

35:01.128 --> 35:03.264
You made them all heroes.

35:03.406 --> 35:05.800
They let you die.

35:06.247 --> 35:08.534
And you made me kill.

35:10.404 --> 35:14.557
After all that I've done,
I deserve this walk.

35:15.041 --> 35:17.078
Are you here for redemption?

35:17.384 --> 35:19.379
In whose eyes?

35:19.534 --> 35:21.382
Your God's?

35:22.449 --> 35:23.818
No...

35:27.387 --> 35:29.757
in the eyes of the people I love.

35:39.279 --> 35:40.447
You know what?

35:42.335 --> 35:43.504
She's right.

35:49.877 --> 35:51.378
We all had this comin'.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.049
Somehow I knew
they'd show up to collect.

36:01.454 --> 36:03.391
Time to pay up.

36:05.092 --> 36:07.128
Time to let go, partner.

37:04.652 --> 37:07.355
I'll take
you all to hell with me.

37:19.846 --> 37:21.014
No, you won't.

37:23.971 --> 37:25.606
They're gonna take you.

38:21.161 --> 38:23.398
She's not part of you anymore.

38:32.639 --> 38:34.175
Of course that would happen.

38:34.208 --> 38:36.144
- What are we doing now?
- We're running.

38:54.795 --> 38:56.297
Freddie, what happened?

38:59.266 --> 39:00.668
- I didn't...
- No, no, no.

39:00.701 --> 39:02.203
You okay?

39:02.235 --> 39:03.737
I'm sorry.

39:06.540 --> 39:08.242
I better go look after the others.

39:12.079 --> 39:13.247
Ferdinand?

39:14.514 --> 39:15.482
Hi.

39:15.516 --> 39:17.452
You didn't push me away.

39:24.257 --> 39:25.525
Right?

39:36.469 --> 39:39.205
I'm gonna hit the road. Soon as I can.

39:39.239 --> 39:41.175
You wanna come with?

39:47.820 --> 39:49.156
I love you.

39:54.112 --> 39:55.915
But everything's changed.

40:14.204 --> 40:15.481
Carlito.

40:15.608 --> 40:17.944
Once again, you leave the heavy
lifting to everybody else.

40:19.378 --> 40:20.947
He had his reasons.

40:22.124 --> 40:24.284
It's gonna be a helluva night.

40:24.317 --> 40:26.286
A brand-new night.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.155
What about you, Mr. Gecko?

40:29.790 --> 40:31.592
I got no idea.

40:33.659 --> 40:34.953
And you know what?

40:39.132 --> 40:41.134
That is fuckin' glorious.

40:43.904 --> 40:45.338
What about you?

40:45.371 --> 40:47.674
I think we're going our separate ways.

40:49.710 --> 40:51.179
Vámonos.

41:06.726 --> 41:08.328
Hermanos Gecko.

41:13.799 --> 41:15.502
Que les vaya bien.

41:19.907 --> 41:23.277
So... what now?

41:24.710 --> 41:26.413
Well...

41:26.445 --> 41:28.915
it seems like everyone in the world,

41:28.949 --> 41:32.485
both this one and the next,
knows what I need to be.

41:32.518 --> 41:33.887
Hmm?

41:33.920 --> 41:35.422
As far as I'm concerned,

41:35.454 --> 41:37.743
there's only one thing we need to be,

41:38.291 --> 41:40.494
and only one way to live.

41:54.674 --> 41:56.676
Well, are we gonna say it?

41:56.710 --> 41:57.712
Say what?

41:59.705 --> 42:00.706
Ah.

42:02.244 --> 42:03.817
Here's to getting rich and fat.

42:03.849 --> 42:06.587
And dyin' in the arms
of a beautiful woman.

42:07.499 --> 42:08.767
Wait a second.

42:08.799 --> 42:10.456
That... doesn't really work anymore.

42:10.489 --> 42:11.925
So what do we say?

42:13.326 --> 42:14.917
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

42:14.952 --> 42:17.425
Do me a favor, try
and taste the carpet, please.

42:17.450 --> 42:18.866
Very nice.

42:18.898 --> 42:20.733
Feel free to file a complaint

42:20.766 --> 42:23.303
with your customer service
agent when we're finished.

42:23.337 --> 42:26.706
In the meantime, everybody just be cool.

42:32.512 --> 42:34.415
You...

42:34.447 --> 42:36.183
be cool.

43:47.987 --> 43:49.690
Success.

44:00.933 --> 44:03.470
Now, that's just beautiful.
