WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:22.801 --> 01:24.831
The stars are in the right
position, Beast Man.

01:25.755 --> 01:26.780
Look.

01:28.050 --> 01:29.401
The Cosmic Comet.

01:30.192 --> 01:34.108
Now is the time to finally
open the gates of Grayskull.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.332
Well, well.  Look who's here...

01:47.740 --> 01:48.966
Arh.  He-Man.

01:49.229 --> 01:50.920
Right you are fur face.

01:51.533 --> 01:53.787
Fur face, you say.

02:19.077 --> 02:20.560
We'll be back, He-Man!

02:21.314 --> 02:22.813
Make sure you wash up first.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.182
Well they won't be
bothering us for a while.

02:25.757 --> 02:27.213
I'm afraid that's not true.

02:29.282 --> 02:31.051
This attack was only a test.

02:31.302 --> 02:32.152
For what?

02:32.223 --> 02:36.429
For the power of the Cosmic Comet.
Skeletor plans to use it against Eternia.

02:36.653 --> 02:38.430
Well, we'll just have to stop him.

02:38.875 --> 02:40.969
It will take more than just courage He-Man.

02:41.675 --> 02:42.973
Zagraz will explain it to you.

02:43.393 --> 02:44.430
Who is Zagraz?

02:44.925 --> 02:46.823
He's the wizard of Zagraz Mountain.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.393
More than a wizard.

02:48.990 --> 02:50.797
He's keeper of the comets.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.595
You must seek him out.  And hurry.

03:01.647 --> 03:03.338
What is this mission, Duncan?

03:03.720 --> 03:06.811
With Your Majesty's permission, I'd
like to keep it a secret for the moment.

03:07.510 --> 03:10.848
But I can say that it's
vital to Eternia's safety.

03:11.476 --> 03:14.101
Vital? Well, Adam,
it looks like you're finally

03:14.126 --> 03:16.288
taking a bit of
serious responsibility.

03:16.301 --> 03:16.910
Thank you, father.

03:17.168 --> 03:19.109
But if it's important to Eternia's safety,

03:19.134 --> 03:21.203
I think the Captain of
the Guard should go along.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.412
Teela, you'll accompany
Man-At-Arms and the Prince.

03:24.777 --> 03:25.395
Yes, Sire.

03:25.989 --> 03:26.775
Can I go too?

03:27.284 --> 03:28.341
There might be some magic.

03:28.723 --> 03:31.029
I don't think so, Orko.

03:31.104 --> 03:35.802
Well, I guess I should stick around here
and practice a few tricks for the banquet.

03:37.021 --> 03:39.607
On the other hand, one can never
tell what might come in handy.

03:39.632 --> 03:41.848
All right Orko, you can go.

03:59.657 --> 04:01.266
The time has come!

04:01.684 --> 04:05.353
Join hands as we bring
together our mystic powers.

04:17.959 --> 04:22.311
Let our evil grow.  Let it reach out.

04:44.170 --> 04:48.372
The Cosmic Comet is now in my power.

04:58.264 --> 05:00.662
We should be almost there.
Hold it, Attak Trak.

05:01.112 --> 05:02.908
Affirmative.  Full stop.

05:09.891 --> 05:11.367
W-What's that?

05:11.907 --> 05:14.206
Zagraz Mountain.  We're here.

05:14.234 --> 05:16.785
Affirmative.  Any special instructions?

05:17.912 --> 05:20.634
Y-Yeah. T-Turn back.

05:31.955 --> 05:36.016
Oh my, visitors, wonderful.

05:40.851 --> 05:43.784
I haven't had company in 100 years.

05:44.737 --> 05:47.853
Or is it 200,
Well I don't kno... it's been a long time.

05:49.262 --> 05:50.574
So what can I do for you?

05:51.903 --> 05:54.606
We were hoping you could tell us
something about the Cosmic Comet.

05:54.607 --> 05:56.791
T-The Cosmic Comet?

05:57.293 --> 05:59.792
Yeah, Skeletor's planning to
take control of it and...

05:59.946 --> 06:00.951
Ah Skeletor!...

06:01.967 --> 06:06.466
No, this is terrible, terrible,
and it's all my fault!

06:06.773 --> 06:07.815
What do you mean?

06:08.608 --> 06:09.713
I'll show you.

06:12.677 --> 06:16.132
Once there were... there were two
happy comets wandering the universe.

06:17.017 --> 06:20.428
I wanted to control them as I
controlled all the other comets.

06:21.336 --> 06:22.512
So I cast a spell.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.645
But I made a mistake.

06:24.912 --> 06:27.351
I was so eager to prove my greatness,

06:27.500 --> 06:31.013
that I used too much power
in the spell, won'tcha know,

06:31.038 --> 06:33.976
and I destroyed one of the comets.

06:37.187 --> 06:41.381
The one that remained, grew lonely
and evil, without it's friend.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.512
It lost it's heart.

06:43.159 --> 06:46.048
I knew then, I was just a
foolish, old wizard.

06:47.259 --> 06:49.382
Not worthy to be keeper of the comets.

06:50.330 --> 06:51.820
You mean there's nothing you can do?

06:52.159 --> 06:54.543
I just haven't got what it takes anymore.

06:55.659 --> 06:57.696
I'm too old and silly, I guess.

06:57.905 --> 06:59.193
I don't think you're so silly,

06:59.543 --> 07:00.835
and anyone can make a mistake.

07:01.955 --> 07:06.120
Thank you Teela. But it...
it doesn't change the facts.

07:06.145 --> 07:08.524
I can't control the Cosmic Comet

07:08.549 --> 07:09.961
and Skeletor can.

07:10.956 --> 07:12.257
All because of me.

07:15.413 --> 07:18.501
When do we begin our
cosmic assault on Eternia?

07:19.185 --> 07:22.724
First we must deal with that
fool, wizard Zagraz.

07:23.075 --> 07:25.518
He alone might interfere with my plans.

07:25.753 --> 07:27.493
Zagraz?  What can he do?

07:28.100 --> 07:29.993
Perhaps, nothing...

07:30.160 --> 07:33.686
He's lost confidence in his powers since
his mistake with the Cosmic Comet.

07:34.210 --> 07:36.212
But I'm not taking any chances.

07:36.890 --> 07:42.763
Cosmic Comet, Hear your master,
send creatures to capture Zagraz.

07:45.119 --> 07:46.990
This should take care of Zagraz.

07:47.295 --> 07:49.992
When those pieces land,
they will become creatures.

07:50.017 --> 07:53.108
Creatures that will capture Zagraz.

07:53.837 --> 07:57.956
He'll soon wish he'd never
even laid eyes on the Comet.

08:04.223 --> 08:06.730
Comets!  And they're coming straight at us!

08:15.735 --> 08:16.451
Adam!

08:20.984 --> 08:21.891
Oh, thanks, Teela.

08:22.316 --> 08:23.760
Just doing my job.

08:24.517 --> 08:25.522
Look!

08:40.193 --> 08:41.222
What are they?

08:41.760 --> 08:44.087
They're pieces of the Cosmic Comet.

08:44.113 --> 08:47.280
Evil power has made them
into unliving monsters.

08:47.965 --> 08:49.032
Then they're not alive?

08:49.342 --> 08:51.384
No no.  They're more like droids.

08:53.293 --> 08:55.668
A-Alive or not, I-It's time to go.

08:57.576 --> 08:58.643
Cringer!

08:58.984 --> 08:59.990
Adam come...

09:00.040 --> 09:01.057
Teela look out!

09:09.575 --> 09:10.742
Try some of this, creature!

09:14.238 --> 09:18.336
Wow, that thing ate Teela's
freeze ray like it was ice cream.

09:18.941 --> 09:20.623
Let's see it chew on this.

09:28.481 --> 09:31.542
Oh my. I think we're in trouble.

09:33.410 --> 09:35.322
Come outta there Cringer.
We've got work to do.

09:36.001 --> 09:40.569
Oh No! My mother didn't
raise any foolish children!

09:43.328 --> 09:44.765
By the power of Grayskull...

09:51.811 --> 09:55.629
I have the power!

10:18.696 --> 10:21.095
Now I know we are in trouble!

10:21.181 --> 10:26.036
They're only comet chunks.
I must try to control them, I must try.

10:26.607 --> 10:28.207
Zagraz. Don't!

10:28.594 --> 10:31.911
Away comet creatures.  Away.

10:34.748 --> 10:35.830
Help!

10:37.081 --> 10:38.198
Oh no, Zagraz!

10:39.115 --> 10:40.804
You got a friend of mine, rock head.

10:48.197 --> 10:53.854
Can't control them. The evil power.
So weak, So weak.

11:05.658 --> 11:07.477
What happened?
He-Man!

11:08.986 --> 11:10.769
I sure am glad to see you.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.468
But where is Prince Adam?

11:13.914 --> 11:14.995
Don't worry, he's safe.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.482
He-Man.
Zagraz, he's hurt!

11:18.954 --> 11:21.127
Old and foolish.
I couldn't do it.

11:21.152 --> 11:23.683
Cosmic Comet was too strong.

11:28.826 --> 11:30.083
We'll help you Zagraz.

11:30.676 --> 11:36.767
Too late. Skeletor already
controls, Cosmic Comet.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.617
We've got to get him to Castle Greyskull.

11:43.533 --> 11:44.567
C'mon.

11:44.858 --> 11:46.860
Hm, these might come in handy.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.819
He's very weak,
but I think I can help him.

12:01.986 --> 12:08.564
Then we'll leave it to you and Orko.
Teela, Man-At-Arms, lets go see Skeletor.

12:11.490 --> 12:13.514
So, it's He-Man.

12:14.257 --> 12:17.716
Beast Man take the
Basher and slow him down.

12:18.334 --> 12:21.304
I'll slow him down, alright.

12:22.251 --> 12:25.625
And you and I, dear
Evil-Lyn, will call upon the

12:25.650 --> 12:29.023
Cosmic Comet,
to defeat He Man once and for all.

12:33.518 --> 12:37.688
Arrival in 2.709 seconds. All passengers be

12:37.713 --> 12:41.882
prepared. Old bonehead is probably waiting.

12:43.722 --> 12:44.981
He won't have to wait long.

12:45.407 --> 12:50.721
Alert, Alert! Air vehicle
approaching for attack. Vector 581.

12:52.899 --> 12:56.498
This will give you something
to think about He-Man.

13:02.028 --> 13:03.066
Can you make it, Trak?

13:05.506 --> 13:10.543
Height of obstacle: 5m, Composition: stone,
Opinion: No problem.

13:14.935 --> 13:17.379
I'll stop you this time.

13:17.851 --> 13:22.486
Air vehicle approaching again.
Suggestion: Let's clip its wings.

13:22.945 --> 13:24.038
Wonderful idea!

13:34.854 --> 13:35.869
No!

13:38.212 --> 13:39.915
Now for Skeletor.

13:42.357 --> 13:43.495
YUCK!

13:44.520 --> 13:46.023
More mud!

13:48.227 --> 13:53.743
Cosmic Comet, obey your master,
give us your power to beat He-Man.

14:02.004 --> 14:04.018
Do you feel it Evil-Lyn?

14:13.732 --> 14:14.992
Welcome He-Man.

14:15.017 --> 14:18.795
Are you here to pledge your loyalty
to the new ruler of Eternia?

14:19.245 --> 14:22.434
You'll be ruling from a dungeon cell
when I'm done through you villains.

14:22.820 --> 14:23.913
Let's get 'em!

14:29.055 --> 14:31.564
We've done it!  We've beaten He Man!

14:32.099 --> 14:33.183
I've done it, you mean.

14:33.543 --> 14:36.347
Remember who controls the Cosmic Comet.

14:36.613 --> 14:38.348
We should chain them
up before they come to!

14:38.979 --> 14:40.003
No hurry, they...

14:41.094 --> 14:43.484
They're gone!  But where, how?

14:43.893 --> 14:45.294
It's the Sorceress, you boob!

14:46.066 --> 14:48.390
Well, she won't cheat me of this victory.

14:49.273 --> 14:53.334
We'll set the Cosmic Comet
on Castle Greyskull, right now!

14:58.080 --> 15:00.323
I've never known Skeletor
to have that much power.

15:00.821 --> 15:02.414
He draws it from the Cosmic Comet.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.407
I'm afraid that he's about to use

15:04.432 --> 15:05.942
the comet to attack Grayskull.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.623
And there's nothing I can do about it.

15:09.513 --> 15:12.132
Maybe I can't control comets anymore,

15:12.157 --> 15:15.050
but I think there is something we could do.

15:15.380 --> 15:16.448
We'll try anything.

15:16.885 --> 15:20.701
If we could make another Cosmic Comet
and fill it with the power of good,

15:21.482 --> 15:25.747
we might be able to use it to cancel out
the evil in this Cosmic Comet,

15:26.740 --> 15:29.262
but we need some pieces
of the comet itself.

15:30.115 --> 15:31.589
You mean like these!

15:36.166 --> 15:38.124
Orko, I could kiss you.

15:38.670 --> 15:39.753
Please do.

15:41.971 --> 15:44.133
Time's a wasting, don'tcha know.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.317
The Sorceress has got to fuse, the pieces

15:47.342 --> 15:49.741
together again and then we can get started.

15:54.088 --> 15:57.365
Let our power reach out once more and bring

15:57.390 --> 16:00.591
the Cosmic Comet down on Castle Greyskull.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.985
The Cosmic Comet's Coming!

16:11.464 --> 16:12.567
It's finished.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.148
Now we have to give it some heart.

16:15.984 --> 16:18.901
Gather around.  You must all touch it.

16:23.221 --> 16:25.280
Oh, it feels so evil.

16:25.889 --> 16:29.450
No, don't think about it.
Concentrate on goodness.

16:30.096 --> 16:33.328
Think of all...
all the good people in Eternia.

16:33.353 --> 16:36.240
Think of the goodness in
your own noble hearts.

16:36.741 --> 16:41.889
Let that goodness,
reach out and overcome the evil.

16:43.899 --> 16:44.992
Hurry , hurry!

16:45.833 --> 16:48.804
It's working, it's working.

16:52.550 --> 16:55.593
That's good, that's very very good.

16:56.051 --> 17:02.090
Thank you. Because of the goodness
in your hearts, my heart beats again.

17:02.627 --> 17:05.444
He-Man! It's here.
The Cosmic Comet is here!

17:10.659 --> 17:17.151
Are you sure this is safe Skeletor?
Suppose Castle Grayskull is not destroyed?

17:18.075 --> 17:19.232
You furry coward!

17:19.257 --> 17:21.980
There's no way Grayskull can be saved!

17:23.409 --> 17:27.070
And I want to be there, to see it fall.

17:31.114 --> 17:35.075
Now it's up to you! You've got
to send this new comet into the sky.

17:35.508 --> 17:37.035
I don't know if I can.

17:37.060 --> 17:38.632
I'm still so weak and

17:38.657 --> 17:41.132
if I make another mistake...

17:41.509 --> 17:43.273
It's time to forget your mistake.

17:43.986 --> 17:45.045
I know you can do it.

17:46.257 --> 17:52.345
Ca you hear me comet, friend?
Fly? Fly away!

17:52.456 --> 17:55.184
I'm trying.
But I need your help Zagraz.

17:57.486 --> 17:58.505
Hurry Zagraz, hurry!

17:59.559 --> 18:03.639
I must have a little more time.

18:04.133 --> 18:05.631
Our time has run out.

18:05.771 --> 18:07.771
Then I'll just have to
slow that comet down.

18:09.028 --> 18:10.611
Sorceress, can you give me a lift?

18:21.693 --> 18:22.819
Got to hold it!

18:23.458 --> 18:26.419
He-Man's done it,
but he can't hold it back for long.

18:26.444 --> 18:28.733
Zagraz, I believe in you.

18:28.758 --> 18:32.833
Try Zagras, please try.
You can do it.

18:33.150 --> 18:40.074
Fly away!  Fly away!  Fly away!

18:44.451 --> 18:46.089
Can't... hang on.

18:53.275 --> 18:55.582
That's the last time
I try to wrestle a comet.

18:58.386 --> 18:59.615
He-Man, are you okay?

19:00.498 --> 19:01.769
More or less.  What happened?

19:02.292 --> 19:04.134
Zagras did it.  Look!

19:04.733 --> 19:07.934
Thank you all, for bringing me back.

19:09.183 --> 19:14.746
And thank you,
for helping me find my heart again.

19:15.994 --> 19:17.077
We knew you could do it.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.636
You had faith in me when I had none.

19:21.182 --> 19:24.903
I feel terrific now don'tcha know. Oh,

19:24.928 --> 19:29.226
I feel terrific. I guess I'm not
old and useless after all.

19:29.763 --> 19:30.893
We never thought you were.

19:33.289 --> 19:35.715
Did you hear that explosion?

19:35.889 --> 19:39.715
The gates of Castle Grayskull
must be cosmic dust.

19:40.143 --> 19:44.867
Skeletor, look.
There's two cosmic comets now.

19:45.056 --> 19:47.503
It can't be. It can't be!

19:49.113 --> 19:50.216
They're coming right at us!

19:51.020 --> 19:52.275
Who could have done this?  Who?

19:53.527 --> 19:56.433
He-Maaaaan!

19:58.833 --> 20:01.705
That's right, Adam.
You just have to concentrate.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.600
Once you can control the magic orbs...

20:04.700 --> 20:07.580
... you're just a step away
from controlling comets.

20:07.812 --> 20:12.134
You are doing fine, don'tcha know.
Just keep concentrating.

20:12.959 --> 20:15.313
That's very impressive, son.

20:15.354 --> 20:16.354
Thanks, Father.

20:16.658 --> 20:20.520
Adam, no, don't stop concentrating!

20:23.629 --> 20:26.515
Zagraz, Adam, get it away! Help!

20:31.514 --> 20:34.027
In today's story, Zagraz had a problem.

20:34.217 --> 20:38.030
He lost his confidence in himself
because he had once failed.

20:38.275 --> 20:42.395
Well now we all fail sometimes,
but we should never be afraid to try again.

20:43.517 --> 20:46.023
And we should always keep
believing in ourselves.

20:46.146 --> 20:50.931
As the old saying goes: If at first you
don't succeed, try, try again.

20:56.407 --> 20:58.591
Until later, bye.
