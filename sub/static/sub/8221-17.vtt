 Quickly thinking,
 he grabs a flagpole,

01:56.282 --> 01:58.484
 jams it in the front spokes
 of the Nazi motorcycle and...

01:58.485 --> 02:01.485
 The motorcycle flips up
 in the air, end over end.

02:04.023 --> 02:06.525
 That is our movie myth.

02:06.526 --> 02:09.526
 NARRATOR: It's a classic scene
 from the silver screen.

 The Doctors Jones,
 Junior and Senior,

 But a flagpole in the front

 sees our hero escape

02:24.310 --> 02:26.078

02:26.079 --> 02:29.047
 This one's really interesting
 from a physics sense.

02:29.048 --> 02:31.450
 Because when I look
 at that scene,

02:31.451 --> 02:33.952
 it doesn't seem awkward
 or out of place.

02:33.953 --> 02:35.654
 But it does beg the question,

02:35.655 --> 02:38.257
 is it really that easy
 to redirect all the energy

02:38.258 --> 02:41.258
 that's going this way
 to going that way?

02:41.427 --> 02:42.728

 that we break it down

02:42.729 --> 02:44.897

 It's a motorcycle myth,
 and we'll be needing a...

 That's a bike.

 Aw, it's lovely.

 Actually, we rode across the
 country in one of these things.

 No way.

 I'm just reeling from learning
 something about you

 It seems that there's
 a never-ending supply of those.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.860
 NARRATOR:
 Okay, it may be old-fashioned,

03:14.861 --> 03:17.496
 but the movie bikes
 are vintage World War I I.

03:17.497 --> 03:18.630
 ADAM:
 I know what you're saying.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.332
 You're saying
 this really doesn't look like

03:20.333 --> 03:23.333
 a vintage World War I I era
 motorcycle, and it isn't.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.770
 In fact, it's from 1981, but
 it is the exact model of bike

03:28.408 --> 03:30.876

 to perform their stunts

03:30.877 --> 03:32.778
 for "Indiana Jones
 and the Last Crusade,"

03:32.779 --> 03:35.779
 which means that it,
 and not some vintage bike,

03:36.015 --> 03:39.015
 is the perfect test platform
 for us for this for this myth.

03:40.086 --> 03:41.520
 NARRATOR:
 Now that that's sorted,

03:41.521 --> 03:43.922
 let's kick things off

03:43.923 --> 03:45.757
 on the first aspect of the myth.

03:45.758 --> 03:47.893
 ADAM: Since this myth is all
 about the poking of a flagpole

03:47.894 --> 03:49.328
 into the spokes of a motorcycle,

03:49.329 --> 03:50.829
 one of the things
 we want to know is,

03:50.830 --> 03:53.830
 how fast can we poke a flagpole?

03:54.834 --> 03:56.602
 NARRATOR:

 their remaining tests

 Just plain funny to watch you
 exert yourself like that.

 this puppy right here

 this was our pigeon catcher.

 an exceedingly weird operation.

 out of toilet paper,

 down the side of the building?

08:01.180 --> 08:03.248
 I think the difficulty here
 is not gonna necessarily

 be the strength of the hair,

 Already it's got
 this built-in weak link.

 So I think twisting it,
 rolling it

 that I need.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.333
 NARRATOR:
 But on this last crusade,

09:28.334 --> 09:30.602
 the team are tackling
 the tall tale

09:30.603 --> 09:33.603
 that a stick between the spokes
 can cause...

09:33.906 --> 09:36.906
...a head-over-handlebars flip.

09:38.477 --> 09:41.079
 So far they've got their bike

09:41.080 --> 09:44.080
 and rigged a remote-control
 flagpole thruster.

09:46.285 --> 09:47.619
 So, what's next?

09:47.620 --> 09:49.854
 JAMIE: When this bike is moving
 at highway speeds,

09:49.855 --> 09:52.855
 the spokes are going so fast,
 you can hardly see them.

09:53.359 --> 09:55.327
 So what we need to find out
 is whether it's possible

09:55.328 --> 09:58.328
 for a human to thrust a stick
 into those spokes

09:59.165 --> 10:01.733
 fast enough to get them
 cleanly through there,

10:01.734 --> 10:04.734
 and then, once that occurs,
 what happens to the wheel.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.239
 NARRATOR: And to get the wheel
 spinning at chasing speeds --

10:08.240 --> 10:11.240
 50 miles per hour --
 Adam whips up a dynamometer.

10:11.844 --> 10:14.844
 And now it's time for the old
 spoke-and-poke test.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.749
 NARRATOR:
 So with the bike secured,

10:17.750 --> 10:20.685
 this test is all about the space
 between the spokes

10:20.686 --> 10:22.887
 and not the full flip.

10:22.888 --> 10:24.222
 This is gonna be cool.

10:24.223 --> 10:26.891
 NARRATOR: Will a flagpole thrust
 at realistic speed

10:26.892 --> 10:28.627
 actually penetrate the wheel?

10:28.628 --> 10:31.628
 3, 2, 1.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.465
 NARRATOR:
 Apparently not.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.367
 Well, that was
 a bit of a letdown.

10:35.368 --> 10:38.368
 NARRATOR: Yes, the stick
 just bounced right back out.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.472
 And after a second test
 under the same conditions...

10:43.542 --> 10:45.710
...produces a similar result,

10:45.711 --> 10:48.013
 the guys decide
 they are missing the point.

10:48.014 --> 10:51.014
 Firing, 3, 2, 1.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.852
 NARRATOR: Perfect.
 Penetration.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.186
 Wheel stoppage.

10:55.187 --> 10:58.187
 And, as a bonus,
 some controlled mayhem.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.259
 We broke some stuff.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.727
 JAMIE:
 We successfully stopped

11:02.728 --> 11:04.462
 the wheel with the stick,
 and that's great.

11:04.463 --> 11:07.463
 That's 15 pounds coming to a
 dead stop from 50 miles an hour.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.802
 But this was a stationary test.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.637
 When we go out on the road
 with this,

11:12.638 --> 11:15.140
 there are hundreds of pounds
 in this bike,

11:15.141 --> 11:18.109
 plus the rider,
 that want to keep on going.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.612
 And that's where
 the real fun is gonna start.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.280
 NARRATOR:
 So it's full scale ahead,

11:22.281 --> 11:25.281
 and the plan in the can
 looks a lot like this.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.318
 At the push of a button,

11:27.319 --> 11:30.319
 the bike and Buster
 will begin freewheeling.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.690
 That, in turn, will trigger
 the flagpole flinger

11:34.193 --> 11:37.193
 and jam the stick
 into the spokes.

11:37.496 --> 11:40.031
 And to get things rolling
 in the right direction,

11:40.032 --> 11:42.400
 Adam's reinventing the wheel.

11:42.401 --> 11:44.436
 ADAM: Well, the first problem
 I think we've got to solve

11:44.437 --> 11:47.138
 is exemplified by taking a look
 at this footage again.

11:47.139 --> 11:49.307
 Yeah. See that?
 Okay.

11:49.308 --> 11:52.308
 The hubbed spoked wheel
 is not really ideal for us

11:52.712 --> 11:53.812
 to shove a stick into

11:53.813 --> 11:56.813
 'cause those spokes
 are not gonna stay put.

11:56.916 --> 11:59.851
 We need a wheel that can stay
 put under continued abuse

11:59.852 --> 12:02.852
 for repeated tests, and we're
 gonna use steel plate to do it.

12:03.923 --> 12:05.757
 We've had two of these
 plasma-cut

12:05.758 --> 12:07.025
 out of quarter-inch steel plate.

12:07.026 --> 12:09.360
 We're gonna bolt them
 to one of the motorcycle rims,

12:09.361 --> 12:10.829
 have a tire put back on it

12:10.830 --> 12:13.798
 and a couple of flange-mounted
 pillow blocks on the axle,

12:13.799 --> 12:16.668
 and that ought to hold up to
 everything we can throw at it.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.269
 [ Laughs ]

12:18.270 --> 12:20.472
 The Road Warrior would be proud.

12:20.473 --> 12:23.473
 This thing is absolutely
 as solid as a rock.

12:23.809 --> 12:26.809
 It's perfect.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.214
 [ Tires screeching ]

12:29.215 --> 12:31.483
 NARRATOR:
 For the prison-break parable...

12:31.484 --> 12:33.618
 This place can't hold me!

12:33.619 --> 12:36.087
 NARRATOR:
...Grant "Iron Man" Imahara...

12:36.088 --> 12:37.789
 I'm bustin' out of here, see?

12:37.790 --> 12:40.091
 NARRATOR:
...Kari "Knuckles" Byron...

12:40.092 --> 12:42.026
 -MAN: Come on.
 -I was framed!

12:42.027 --> 12:44.662

12:49.468 --> 12:52.468
 Prisoners, step in.

12:54.540 --> 12:57.342
 NARRATOR: They're going to find
 out if you can effect an escape

12:57.343 --> 13:00.343
 with ropes made of bedsheets,
 toilet paper, and hair.

13:01.547 --> 13:04.249
 KARI: My collection of hair
 gathered from the shower

13:04.250 --> 13:06.818
 and all the rattails
 I've been stealing...

13:06.819 --> 13:08.153
 Aah!

13:08.154 --> 13:11.154
...I will have no problem making
 a rope and getting out of here.

13:11.423 --> 13:13.358
 NARRATOR:
 But despite being forced to use

13:13.359 --> 13:15.760
 authentic cell-made materials...

13:15.761 --> 13:18.761
 Warden, I got diarrhea.
 I need more toilet paper.

13:19.198 --> 13:20.899
 NARRATOR:... the guys
 won't really have to prepare

13:20.900 --> 13:23.900
 their escape in their cells.

13:24.236 --> 13:26.237
 They get to do that
 back at the shop,

13:26.238 --> 13:27.705
 where Tory has worked out

13:27.706 --> 13:30.706
 that if he twists
 one-ply prison-issue tissue,

13:30.776 --> 13:32.277
 it becomes less fragile.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.546
 TORY: As you can see,
 I'm twisting the toilet paper

13:34.547 --> 13:35.613
 into little strings.

13:35.614 --> 13:37.649
 Once I have enough strings,
 I'll weave it into a rope,

13:37.650 --> 13:40.650
 and hopefully that will be
 strong enough to hold my weight,

13:40.820 --> 13:42.754
 and that will be my ticket
 out of this joint.

13:42.755 --> 13:45.557
 And this process is taking
 a long time,

13:45.558 --> 13:47.458
 but, let's face it, I'm in jail.

13:47.459 --> 13:49.227
 I got nothing but time.

13:49.228 --> 13:52.228
 Someday I'll be free 

13:52.631 --> 13:53.965
 Bing 

13:53.966 --> 13:55.533
 NARRATOR:
 It may be time-consuming,

13:55.534 --> 13:58.236
 but before
 modern manufacturing techniques,

13:58.237 --> 14:01.237
 this is exactly
 how real rope was made.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.340
 Fibers of material
 were twisted into yarns.

14:04.376 --> 14:05.743
 A few of these yarns

14:05.744 --> 14:08.744
 were twisted in the opposite
 direction to form threads,

14:09.048 --> 14:11.182
 and, again, several of these

14:11.183 --> 14:14.052
 were counter-twisted
 to form rope.

14:14.053 --> 14:17.053
 So it might sound crazy, but
 Tory could be on to something.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.190
 [ Laughs ] I'm gonna get
 out of jail in no time.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.461
 NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
 Kari's about to find out

14:23.462 --> 14:26.462
 if her plan for a braided escape
 is even viable.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.968
 KARI: I'm a little nervous
 about the strength of the hair,

14:29.969 --> 14:31.536
 so I've got a knotted piece here

14:31.537 --> 14:34.272
 that I was actually just gonna
 try my weight on.

14:34.273 --> 14:37.273
 I'm really kind of nervous
 about this because of...

14:38.544 --> 14:39.844
 [Bleep]

14:39.845 --> 14:42.845
...that factor.

14:42.948 --> 14:45.817
 Maybe I need to find some
 inmates with some less healthy,

14:45.818 --> 14:46.985
 slippery hair --

14:46.986 --> 14:49.986
 some good, fried-out,
 bleached-blond inmates.

14:50.289 --> 14:53.289
 NARRATOR: Yeah, or maybe,
 just like a conventional rope,

14:53.726 --> 14:56.527
 you could braid a number of
 those single strands together.

14:56.528 --> 14:58.062
 KARI:
 I'm gonna take three braids

14:58.063 --> 15:00.198
 and tie them all into one braid

15:00.199 --> 15:01.933
 so that it's sort of
 how rope works,

15:01.934 --> 15:04.934
 where one fails, it has two more
 to kind of depend on.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.339
 And hopefully that can give it
 more strength.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.708
 Unfortunately,
 I'm getting claw hand

15:10.709 --> 15:12.710
 from, like, all the braiding.

15:12.711 --> 15:14.178
 Ugh.

15:14.179 --> 15:16.114
 NARRATOR:
 And that just leaves Grant,

15:16.115 --> 15:19.115
 who got lucky, with the least
 labor-intensive material.

15:19.485 --> 15:20.985
 GRANT:
 The bedsheet is beautiful

15:20.986 --> 15:23.655
 because you can go
 to the prison laundry,

15:23.656 --> 15:25.490
 steal as many as you need.

15:25.491 --> 15:28.491
 You don't need a hundred years
 to make your bedsheet rope.

15:28.861 --> 15:31.861
 You need about, I don't know,
 maybe two hours,

15:32.064 --> 15:34.732
 and you're climbing
 your way to freedom.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.701
 NARRATOR:
 However, the toilet-paper plan

15:36.702 --> 15:39.637
 is taking a lot, lot longer.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.439
 I need to spread my wings
 and fly.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.974
 NARRATOR:
 So, to speed things up,

15:42.975 --> 15:45.975
 our crafty criminal uses
 his mastermind to good effect

15:48.447 --> 15:51.447
 by twisting multiple strands
 at once and cheating.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.186
 TORY: So, I've taken five sheets
 of toilet paper,

15:55.187 --> 15:56.988
 twisted them together
 to create this.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.057
 Now I'm gonna take three
 of these, wrap them together,

15:59.058 --> 16:01.025
 and then take that
 and wrap that together

16:01.026 --> 16:03.761
 and hopefully create a rope
 that's gonna be strong enough

16:03.762 --> 16:04.963
 to hold up my weight.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.731
 NARRATOR:
 Meanwhile, over in Grant's cell,

16:06.732 --> 16:09.732
 he's testing to see if
 the sheets can take the strain.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.937
 GRANT: So, what we have here
 is a single standard

16:12.938 --> 16:15.938
 Alameda County bedsheet
 with a knot tied at the top,

16:16.275 --> 16:18.910
 threaded through
 150 pounds of weight,

16:18.911 --> 16:21.279
 which is equivalent
 to my body weight.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.647
 And as you can see,

16:22.648 --> 16:25.049
 it's actually doing quite well
 so far.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.085
 NARRATOR:
 Outside in the exercise yard,

16:27.086 --> 16:30.086
 Tory is also ready
 for a strength test.

16:31.390 --> 16:32.557
 This might work!

16:32.558 --> 16:34.292
 NARRATOR:
 Kari, however, is still

16:34.293 --> 16:36.527
 desperately braiding
 and plaiting.

16:36.528 --> 16:39.528
 She's more concerned about
 the hair's joints and splices

16:39.765 --> 16:42.765
 than its tensile strength.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.168
 After all, keratin, the major
 protein component of hair,

16:46.772 --> 16:49.407
 is as hard as nails --
 literally.

16:49.408 --> 16:52.408
 It's also the stuff that forms
 horns, claws, and hooves.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.013
 The question is,
 will it also make rope?

16:59.551 --> 17:01.486
 Jamie and Adam
 are flipping out...

17:05.324 --> 17:08.324
 that jamming a stick
 between the spokes...

17:08.894 --> 17:11.894
...will cause
 a motorcycle flip-out.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.632
 But they've got
 a tough build ahead.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.134
 In order to go full scale
 with this,

17:16.135 --> 17:19.135
 we need to both be able to hold
 this bike and let go of it

17:20.406 --> 17:22.140

17:22.141 --> 17:24.175
 So we're gonna start
 by building a trailer

17:24.175 --> 17:26.944
 that holds it upright,
 that, on the push of a button,

17:26.944 --> 17:29.313
 releases it,
 and then, once it's released,

17:29.314 --> 17:32.314
 will fire a stick right through
 those front spokes.

17:34.119 --> 17:37.119
 NARRATOR: In engineering terms,
 there's a mountain to climb.

17:37.189 --> 17:40.189
 And what better way to show the
 passage of time than a montage?

17:47.866 --> 17:50.866
 And a cross-dissolve later,
 the rig is ready to roll.

17:51.437 --> 17:54.437
 But before the cameras do, the
 team needs a change of scenery.

18:03.682 --> 18:05.550
 ADAM: It's a good day
 for a motorcycle accident.

18:05.551 --> 18:08.551
 -JAMIE: I think so.
 -Let's make a few.

18:09.021 --> 18:12.021
 NARRATOR: Unlikely to have

18:16.795 --> 18:18.696
 -But Adam?
 -ADAM: Let's trade.

18:23.969 --> 18:26.838

 this is a good idea.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.580
 Even with seat belts,
 I worry about Adam.

 Are you done yet?
 We got some work to do.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.789

 -All right. Let's do it.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.758
 -[ Engine stalls ]
 -Oh! Aw.

18:47.759 --> 18:50.495

 reassembles the trailer

18:50.496 --> 18:51.729

 for its big scene.

...he's ready for a test run.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.340
 ADAM: This may look pretty
 straightforward,

19:02.341 --> 19:03.774
 but, actually,
 it's a pretty complicated rig,

19:03.775 --> 19:06.244
 and there's a lot of little
 things which we're not sure

19:06.245 --> 19:09.180
 exactly how they might react
 to getting up to speed.

19:09.181 --> 19:10.481
 So that's the first thing
 we're gonna do --

19:10.482 --> 19:13.482
 get the whole rig up to speed
 and just see how it runs.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.486

 And with the truck easing up

19:15.487 --> 19:17.588
 to 25 miles per hour...

19:17.589 --> 19:19.023

26:16.274 --> 26:17.808

 a little bit

 so that the bike will tend to
 want to stay upright for longer,

 more energy in the process,

26:46.571 --> 26:49.571
 didn't help
 the bike get airborne.

26:49.941 --> 26:52.676
 Instead,
 that extra energy was used

26:52.677 --> 26:55.677
 to snap the flagpole in half.

 circumstances of the myth there.

 perfectly into the spokes.

28:20.298 --> 28:22.599
 GRANT: I was watching her
 form the rope,

28:22.600 --> 28:25.102
 and there were many times
 where she had to take it apart

28:25.103 --> 28:27.905
 because she would test it
 and it would just go "fwshh!"

28:27.906 --> 28:29.640
 She's got multiple strands,
 you know,

28:29.641 --> 28:32.641
 forming a big, thick rope
 of hair, but I don't know.

28:33.912 --> 28:36.780
 At this point, my confidence
 isn't especially high.

28:36.781 --> 28:38.382
 NARRATOR:
 And neither is Kari's.

28:38.383 --> 28:41.383
 Whose hair-ball idea is this?

28:41.519 --> 28:44.354
 NARRATOR: Well, it's
 a "hair"-brain plan, for sure,

28:44.355 --> 28:46.557
 but it's too late
 to turn back now.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.558
 We're about to find out if
 that hairy lifeline will cut it.

28:52.030 --> 28:55.030
 TORY: Man. Oh.

28:55.033 --> 28:57.701
 GRANT: It's looking pretty good
 so far, actually.

28:57.702 --> 28:59.536
 TORY: Well, the hair is --
 It's holding up.

28:59.537 --> 29:00.637
 GRANT:
 That's great.

29:00.638 --> 29:02.606
 TORY: It's incredible
 how strong it is.

29:02.607 --> 29:04.875
 -Whoa!
 -GRANT: Whoa!

29:04.876 --> 29:07.745
 NARRATOR: It defies belief,
 but Kari's descent

29:07.746 --> 29:09.713
 is being supported
 by nothing more

29:09.714 --> 29:12.714
 than a 1 40-feet-long
 triple-braided ponytail.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.285
 How's it going, Kari?

29:15.286 --> 29:16.520
 KARI:
 I see split ends.

29:16.521 --> 29:18.122
 TORY: You should have used
 conditioner.

29:18.123 --> 29:19.723
 KARI:
 There's split ends!

29:19.724 --> 29:21.325
 NARRATOR:
 Hair-care issues aside,

29:21.326 --> 29:24.326
 Kari's descent is going
 spectacularly well.

29:24.796 --> 29:25.996
 TORY:
 You're almost free!

29:25.997 --> 29:27.831
 NARRATOR:
 And her technique of sliding

29:27.832 --> 29:30.701
 instead of climbing
 is just perfect.

29:30.702 --> 29:33.070
 -Yeah!
 -You're free!

29:33.071 --> 29:34.271
 GRANT:
 You did it!

29:34.272 --> 29:36.073
 The hair didn't break.

29:36.074 --> 29:38.876
 I've got to say,
 I'm totally amazed.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.344
 My hands -- little jacked.

29:40.345 --> 29:43.345
 This rope is composed
 of hair that's braided.

29:44.749 --> 29:46.183
 And if you look at it,

29:46.184 --> 29:49.184
 it's actually kind of springy,
 which is just crazy.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.121
 It's effective.

29:51.122 --> 29:53.123
 Disgusting, but effective.

29:53.124 --> 29:54.291
 Yeah!

29:54.292 --> 29:56.160
 Oh, my God!
 That was so scary!

29:56.161 --> 29:57.861
 -Yeah?
 -And the hair didn't break.

29:57.862 --> 29:59.763
 I can't believe it didn't break.

29:59.764 --> 30:02.699
 KARI: It was like I'd slide,
 grab a knot, slide, grab a knot.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.635
 But the whole time, I was just
 like, "It's coming undone,

30:04.636 --> 30:06.937
 it's coming undone, it's coming
 undone, it's coming undone!"

30:06.938 --> 30:09.273
 When I was right close to
 the ground, I had about a foot.

30:09.274 --> 30:10.908
 Then I kind of dropped
 a little bit.

30:10.909 --> 30:12.843
 That's the only time
 I actually felt the rope

30:12.844 --> 30:15.112
 kind of -- the belay --
 was the last foot.

30:15.113 --> 30:18.113
 The whole time, that was
 sheer human hair strength.

30:19.918 --> 30:21.752
 NARRATOR:
 Incredible, but true.

30:21.753 --> 30:23.287
 But unlike the bedsheets,

30:23.288 --> 30:26.288
 the guys are reluctant
 to call this one confirmed.

30:26.791 --> 30:28.725
 TORY: The hair worked,
 and it didn't break.

30:28.726 --> 30:30.594
 I mean, it's not
 the most practical technique,

30:30.595 --> 30:32.262
 but if you can get
 that amount of hair

30:32.263 --> 30:35.263
 and braid it together,
 you can make rope and escape.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.035
 NARRATOR: Yeah,
 unless your name's Rapunzel,

30:38.036 --> 30:40.604
 getting that amount of hair
 could be an issue.

30:40.605 --> 30:43.605
 But as a mythical rope-making
 material, it does actually work.

30:47.779 --> 30:48.378
 ADAM: 3...

30:48.379 --> 30:49.980
 NARRATOR:
 On the motorcycle movie myth,

30:49.981 --> 30:52.981
 Adam and Jamie are having
 a flipping good time.

30:53.351 --> 30:54.885
 I didn't see no bike-o flip-o.

30:54.886 --> 30:56.687
 NARRATOR:
 But so far there's been no sign

30:56.688 --> 30:59.688
 of the mythical
 head-over-handlebars flip.

30:59.824 --> 31:01.258
 JAMIE:
 Okay, you can stop.

31:01.259 --> 31:04.259
 NARRATOR: So they decided
 to beef things up a bit.

31:04.495 --> 31:07.495
 So, at 40 miles an hour,
 hickory didn't really cut it.

31:08.166 --> 31:11.166
 So this time,
 we're gonna use a steel pipe.

31:11.302 --> 31:14.302
 This is about eight times
 as heavy, and...

31:15.773 --> 31:17.708
...it's gonna do something
 pretty violent.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.576
 ADAM: Hopefully,
 this is the "it" shot.

31:19.577 --> 31:22.145
 This is either going to flip
 this motorcycle

31:22.146 --> 31:24.281
 or prove once and for all
 that it's totally not possible.

31:24.282 --> 31:26.984
 -I hope this works.
 -What's not to work?

31:26.985 --> 31:29.853
 [ Both laugh ]

31:29.854 --> 31:31.889
 Oh, so many things.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.957
 NARRATOR: But if it goes
 according to plan,

31:33.958 --> 31:36.958
 Buster will soon be taking
 a short, dizzying flight

31:37.562 --> 31:40.562
 with a mandatory crash landing.

31:40.932 --> 31:43.433
 Okay. Pull in 3, 2, 1.

 [ Laughs ]

31:50.008 --> 31:53.008
 Give me five there!

31:55.513 --> 31:58.513
 NARRATOR: Another
 smooth execution by the rig,

31:58.650 --> 32:01.518
 and you could say
 the guys are pleased.

32:01.519 --> 32:03.620
 Well, that seemed to work
 just beautifully.

32:03.621 --> 32:04.988
 It doesn't get
 any prettier than that.

32:04.989 --> 32:07.257
 -JAMIE: No. It was flawless.
 -And the bike did not flip.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.825
 JAMIE: No.
 The tires skidded.

32:08.826 --> 32:10.761
 You know, that's it.
 That's the perfect test.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.129
 ADAM:
 It's forward momentum.

32:12.130 --> 32:14.698
 It doesn't transfer immediately
 to vertical momentum.

32:14.699 --> 32:15.966
 It makes all the sense
 in the world

32:15.967 --> 32:17.267
 now that I've seen it happen.

32:17.268 --> 32:19.503
 JAMIE: You know, you could stop
 the bad guy that way

32:19.504 --> 32:21.138
 if you happen to have
 a steel pipe,

32:21.139 --> 32:22.839
 but it's not getting airborne.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.840
 It won't happen.
 It's gonna do exactly that.

32:25.843 --> 32:27.711
 ADAM:
 Dude, that totally worked.

32:27.712 --> 32:29.012
 Freakin' "A."

32:29.013 --> 32:31.281
 The most important thing
 to keep in mind about this test

32:31.282 --> 32:34.282
 is the traction between
 this wheel and the road surface.

32:34.652 --> 32:35.986
 Nice work, Buster!

32:35.987 --> 32:38.455
 If you bring the wheel
 to a dead stop

32:38.456 --> 32:41.224
 like you will if you put
 a stick between the spokes,

32:41.225 --> 32:42.359
 it's gonna skid.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.061
 You're gonna lose control.

32:44.062 --> 32:46.596
 It'll slip out from under
 the bike, and it's all over.

32:46.597 --> 32:49.597
 It will not get it airborne
 like it did in the movie.

32:50.268 --> 32:52.502
 Oh! So satisfying.

32:52.503 --> 32:55.503
 NARRATOR: So, no bike-o flip-o
 even with the mayo.

32:56.474 --> 32:57.975
 ADAM:
 You know what we have to do now.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.976
 We have to finish on a bike
 that's... doing a flip.

33:02.013 --> 33:04.281
 Hook or by crook,
 we have to finish with that.

33:04.282 --> 33:07.282
 Physics, one, movies, zero.

33:07.552 --> 33:09.419
 NARRATOR:
 And so it's back to the shop

33:09.420 --> 33:12.420
 to square the account and find
 out the physics of film effects.

 [ Horn beeping ]

33:14.525 --> 33:15.826
 Dude, check this out.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.495
 It looks like this whole scene
 is just a trick of editing.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.097
 You can see
 that when the bike takes off,

33:20.098 --> 33:23.098
 it's totally stationary, and if
 I frame forward a couple frames,

33:24.202 --> 33:26.036
 you can see a small explosion
 underneath.

33:26.037 --> 33:28.372
 That's a classic Hollywood
 sleight of hand.

33:28.373 --> 33:30.741
 Yeah, it's pretty clear if we're
 gonna do this Hollywood-style,

33:30.742 --> 33:33.210
 we're gonna need some explosives
 to get that bike in the air.

33:33.211 --> 33:35.579
 -We need a boom.
 -Exactly.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.148
 NARRATOR:
 Yep, so the key is TNT.

33:38.149 --> 33:39.616
 And with that in mind,

33:39.617 --> 33:42.617
 our special-effects specialists
 get back to work.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.688
 JAMIE: This is what is known
 as a mortar.

33:44.689 --> 33:47.024
 Now, this is what is going to
 make the bike

33:47.025 --> 33:50.025
 do what we couldn't do
 with a stick through the spokes.

33:50.428 --> 33:51.962
 We're gonna fill this
 with gunpowder.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.964
 We're gonna put it
 underneath the bike,

33:53.965 --> 33:56.965
 and it's gonna fire
 a bunch of black powder,

33:57.402 --> 33:59.136
 shooting the bike
 way up in the air

33:59.137 --> 34:00.871
 and spinning while it does it.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.807
 NARRATOR: To survive that
 black-powder-powered flight,

34:03.808 --> 34:05.742
 the bike gets a once-over
 from Adam.

34:05.743 --> 34:08.245
 ADAM: I reinforced
 its skeletal structure

34:08.246 --> 34:10.480
 so that it can be punched
 from behind the engine

34:10.481 --> 34:13.016

 their favorite movie heroes...

37:34.919 --> 37:36.753
 -[ Whip cracks ]
 -That's the only crack I know.

37:36.754 --> 37:39.422
 I can't... crack like that.
 Ow.

37:39.423 --> 37:42.025
...pretend to be in one
 of their favorite movies.

37:42.026 --> 37:43.627
 [ Whip cracking ]

37:43.628 --> 37:45.295
 All right.
 Let's get to filming.

37:45.296 --> 37:47.897
 NARRATOR: And to make sure
 this silver scene re-creation

37:47.898 --> 37:50.898
 is spot-on, the bike and Buster
 get a makeover

37:51.902 --> 37:54.304
 by the wardrobe department.

37:54.305 --> 37:55.972
 ADAM:
 It looks good.

37:55.973 --> 37:57.574
 NARRATOR:
 And Buster is given no choice

37:57.575 --> 38:00.575
 about his participation
 in the upcoming stunt.

38:00.678 --> 38:03.079
 That's how the old Hollywood
 stunt men used to do it.

38:03.080 --> 38:06.080
 "Wire me in!" they'd scream.
 [ Chuckles ]

38:06.784 --> 38:08.785
 Buster's old-school.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.688
 NARRATOR: With our very own
 member of the Third Reich

38:11.689 --> 38:14.689
 on his bike, the guys,
 with the help of Matt the pyro,

38:15.693 --> 38:18.693
 prepare the mortar that
 will send Buster into the air.

38:19.497 --> 38:21.264
 JAMIE: We've got this mortar
 with the plate

38:21.265 --> 38:22.299
 right on top of it.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.734
 That plate is welded
 to the bottom of the motorcycle.

38:24.735 --> 38:26.303
 It's very secure.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.505
 When that gunpowder goes off,

38:28.506 --> 38:31.141
 the plate is gonna go up,
 and that's all there is to it.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.710
 NARRATOR: With Jamie applying
 the finishing touches,

38:33.711 --> 38:36.711
 Adam takes delivery of
 the final piece of the puzzle.

38:37.381 --> 38:39.482
 Dude, I totally want
 one of these.

38:39.483 --> 38:42.483
 NARRATOR: So now Adam's got
 the ride to go with the outfit.

38:42.853 --> 38:45.853
 Awesome. Look. It's got a seat
 for Jamie and everything.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.729
 Ba-da-da-da!
 Ba-da-da! 

38:52.730 --> 38:55.730
 NARRATOR: And with that out
 of his system, it's stunt time.

38:56.067 --> 38:58.468
 ADAM:
 It's like nerd fantasy camp.

38:58.469 --> 39:00.370
 Okay, so, here's
 how the Mythbusters'

39:00.371 --> 39:02.205
 big-budget movie shot
 is gonna break down.

39:02.206 --> 39:04.107
 Jamie and I will start
 the motorcycle and sidecar

39:04.108 --> 39:06.643
 about 100 feet
 behind our stunt cycle.

39:06.644 --> 39:08.078
 We're gonna drive right past it.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.946
 When we get 100 feet
 ahead of it,

39:09.947 --> 39:12.115
 the pyro's gonna detonate
 the charge in this.

39:12.116 --> 39:15.116
 Our stunt Buster is gonna fly
 up in the air end over end,

39:15.319 --> 39:16.920
 and the long lens
 that we're shooting it from

39:16.921 --> 39:19.921
 is gonna make it look like we're
 a lot closer to the explosion

39:19.924 --> 39:21.324
 than we actually are.

39:21.325 --> 39:22.959
 [ Horn beeping ]

39:22.960 --> 39:25.960
 You ready, old man?
 You got a taste for adventure?

39:26.497 --> 39:28.932
 [ Chuckling ] Okay.
 Here we go.

39:28.933 --> 39:31.933
 [ Engine revving ]

39:32.370 --> 39:35.370
 NARRATOR: So everyone,
 including Buster, is all set.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.141
 Adam and Jamie roll up to speed,

39:38.142 --> 39:41.142
 and Matt waits with his finger
 on the detonator.

39:41.379 --> 39:44.180
 To get the shot,
 the timing, camera angle,

39:44.181 --> 39:47.181
 and flight of the bike
 has to be just so.

39:50.421 --> 39:53.421
 And that couldn't have gone
 better.

39:53.457 --> 39:55.992
 [ Laughs ]
 Well, the timing was perfect.

39:55.993 --> 39:57.460
 If you say so, Junior.

39:57.461 --> 40:00.461
 [ Laughs ]

40:00.464 --> 40:02.832
 NARRATOR:
 Well, let's check the footage.

40:02.833 --> 40:05.833
 The mortar exploded as Adam
 and Jamie hit their mark,

40:06.036 --> 40:09.036
 and Buster, the chasing Nazi
 with a stick in the spokes,

40:09.974 --> 40:12.974
 goes head over handlebars.

40:13.677 --> 40:15.378
 ADAM: [ Laughs ]

40:15.379 --> 40:16.980
 Oh, that's awesome.

40:16.981 --> 40:19.282
 JAMIE: I'm seeing it go
 ass over teakettle.

40:19.283 --> 40:21.351
 ADAM: That's exactly
 what it looks like in the movie.

40:21.352 --> 40:24.320
 NARRATOR: Yep, as
 a quick comparison confirms,

40:24.321 --> 40:26.089
 the guys got the shot.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.124
 ADAM:
 It's beautiful.

40:28.125 --> 40:29.826
 You may watch this
 and still think,

40:29.827 --> 40:31.928
 "I think it could happen
 to the motorcycle

40:31.929 --> 40:33.029
 under the right conditions."

40:33.030 --> 40:36.030
 Let me point out
 this stick in the wheel

40:36.734 --> 40:38.435
 made the motorcycle skid.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.036
 How much energy did it take

40:40.037 --> 40:42.839
 to make the bike go
 completely vertical?

40:42.840 --> 40:45.840
 Enough energy to crush this
 3/8-inch-thick steel plate

40:47.511 --> 40:50.511
 and crack the frame
 in like 19 different places.

40:50.514 --> 40:52.515
 That's a hell of a lot
 more energy

40:52.516 --> 40:54.951
 than you can generate
 with a wooden stick.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.952
 Myth busted.

41:00.191 --> 41:02.892
 And now, Buster, for doing such
 a good job, gets his reward.

41:02.893 --> 41:04.127
 He really likes it this way.

41:04.128 --> 41:07.128
 Nice work, Buster!
 Nice work!
