00:03.253 --> 00:05.756
MALORY:
What do you mean, Lana hasn't called?

00:05.923 --> 00:09.769
I've been sitting here for, like, 5 million years
and the phone hasn't rung once.

00:09.927 --> 00:13.852
So every time it doesn't, I just assume
it's not her, not calling to say they--

00:14.014 --> 00:17.518
They should've rescued Sterling
and Rip from the pirates hours ago.

00:17.684 --> 00:21.609
Maybe they did and just didn't call.
No, I gave them explicit orders to--

00:21.772 --> 00:23.445
What the hell are you wearing?

00:23.607 --> 00:26.781
Uh, this thing called "my boss
made me sleep at my desk," so pajamas.

00:26.944 --> 00:31.871
Men's pajamas?
For God's sake, woman, where is your pride?

00:32.031 --> 00:33.830
In my work?

00:33.992 --> 00:36.586
That may be the funniest thing
you've ever said.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.247
Thank you.
MALORY: Oh, shut up.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.628
And then try Lana's sat phone.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.089
Wait, what if Lana's been captured too?

00:43.252 --> 00:46.847
Then I'll have to ransom her
and Sterling and Rip and--

00:47.005 --> 00:50.134
Well, no, Miss Gillette's on her own. Still...

00:50.300 --> 00:54.100
Get Cyril in here!
I need him to find a way to pay for all this!

00:54.263 --> 00:56.982
CYRIL:
Wait a minute, that can't be right.

00:57.724 --> 01:02.981
I remember being really mad and really drunk
and deciding to do some online banking.

01:03.146 --> 01:07.902
Oh, my God, I must have embezz--
--arrassed myself last night, huh?

01:08.277 --> 01:12.623
Don't talk like black people.
And how should I know? I'm still ripped.

01:12.781 --> 01:17.662
Oh. So you don't, um, happen to remember
me saying anything about passwords...

01:17.828 --> 01:20.001
...to say, <i>Swiss</i> bank accounts?

01:20.163 --> 01:23.383
Heh. I don't even remember
who peed on your sofa.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.510
Although, if I was a gambling man--

01:25.669 --> 01:26.761
MALORY: Cyril!
Wha--?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.298
Ugh. Smells like a kennel in here.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.341
Cash reserves, how much do we have?

01:31.508 --> 01:35.103
I'll, uh, need to run those numbers. Heh.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.310
Hurry up, we don't have a minute to lose.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.851
God only knows what kind of torture
Sterling's going through.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

02:00.787 --> 02:03.040
Get off...

02:03.206 --> 02:04.674
...the bucket.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.710
I'm not done.
Yes, you are.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.628
But I didn't... You know.

02:08.794 --> 02:12.390
I can't with all the-- Everybody looking at me,
and then the judgments--

02:12.549 --> 02:13.550
LANA: Noah?
Yes.

02:13.717 --> 02:16.971
I just traveled 8000 miles
and got ambushed by Malaysian pirates...

02:17.137 --> 02:21.187
...trying to rescue a person who is now
responsible for my getting crabs twice.

02:21.350 --> 02:25.150
Oh, come on.
These crabs, this time, were not my fault.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.815
This whole dungeon is, um...

02:27.981 --> 02:32.407
Were you gonna say "lousy with them"?
I was, but then I realized that's, uh--

02:32.569 --> 02:34.321
Where that phrase comes from? Yeah.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.990
Yeah.
Yeah.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.625
Yeah. So guess what I'm in?
Um...

02:38.909 --> 02:39.910
No mood?

02:40.077 --> 02:42.375
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

02:42.537 --> 02:48.385
Wait, shouldn't it be some kind of crab dish,
because of the crabs? Like, uh, crab cakes?

02:48.543 --> 02:51.513
Ooh. Or Lana. Lana.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.890
Lana.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.017
What? Lana!

02:56.176 --> 03:00.147
Dungeon. Us. Crab. Huh?

03:00.305 --> 03:02.103
Because we're in a dungeon.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.233
I'm kidding. Crab rangoon.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.933
ARCHER:
Noah, seriously, I swear to God, stop.

03:44.099 --> 03:47.023
Rock beats spoon. You should know that,
you're an archeologist.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.812
Anthropologist.

03:48.979 --> 03:52.233
Whatever. If you're doing it
just to get on my nerves, okay, I get it.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.322
But if you're trying to actually escape--

03:54.484 --> 03:56.327
Well, at least he's trying something.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.409
Yeah, as opposed to the Doublemint Twins.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.701
Heh-heh-heh. And one, two, three, go, herd.
LANA: Whoa! Unh!

04:01.867 --> 04:04.336
Missed it by that much.
Shut up.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.794
It's no use. The trapdoor goes up
a vertical shaft to the radio room.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.503
Exactly, and if we get to the radio--

04:09.666 --> 04:10.963
RILEY:
Which this idiot shot to pieces--

04:12.335 --> 04:15.134
Holy shit.
Wha--? What the hell happened to him?

04:15.297 --> 04:17.675
He--
Who knows? Maybe he had a brain aneurysm.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.594
No, he--
it's the silent killer, Noah.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.480
Not unlike a metal spoon
sharpened to a razor's edge...

04:23.638 --> 04:27.768
...and used to slit
an anthropologist's bird-like throat.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.153
He just kind of keeled over.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.610
Probably thanks to your bucket-stanch.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.195
Wha--? Excuse me, I didn't even go.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.451
We're going. One, two, three, down, herd.
LANA: Oof.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.033
Jeez, how about a little warning?
I said, down, herd.

04:39.196 --> 04:42.450
Uh, couple things. One, Ray,
thanks for perpetuating the stereotype...

04:42.616 --> 04:45.165
...of the gay man as a collegiate cheerleader.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.501
Uh, yeah. For your information,
almost all male cheerleaders are--

04:48.663 --> 04:52.793
Finely-tuned hetero-athletes.
Yeah, hang on, I'm getting a call. Brriing!

04:52.959 --> 04:55.678
Hello? Hi, it's lacrosse, you lose.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.885
Wait, the phone.
Lacrosse?

04:58.048 --> 05:00.142
Yeah, it's Algonquin for "blood sport"?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.348
It's not Algonquin for anything.
Noah...

05:02.511 --> 05:05.390
My sat phone.
Yeah. See, Noah? Her-- Wait, your what?

05:05.555 --> 05:07.808
My sat phone. The pirates took it.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.478
And since I haven't called in,
ISIS should be calling me anytime now.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.858
Jeezow, Lana, answer your stupid phone.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.868
<i>MAN :
Hello? Give me Sterling Archer mother.</i>

05:19.027 --> 05:20.870
Oh, my God, be more Chinese-y.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.078
Pirates, line two.
MALORY: Wha--? Well, put them through.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.039
Oh, my God, be more "I hate you."

05:26.201 --> 05:28.078
That's why your phone is blinking.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.872
MALORY:
Oh. Hello?

05:30.038 --> 05:31.711
This is Malory Archer.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.546
This is Malory Archer.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.585
Okay, then you listen to me.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.255
No, you just listen to me, buster.
<i>Bucky.</i>

05:38.421 --> 05:42.517
If you touch one hair on my son's head,
I'll have your guts for garters.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.270
<i>Aha, you like wear garter?</i>

05:45.428 --> 05:47.647
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
It's an idiom, you heathen.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.768
Malory will call, she'll haggle
over the ransom for you, me and Riley.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.187
What about me?
Yeah, and me?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.821
We'll come back for you later.

05:54.980 --> 05:58.530
No, shut up. We gotta get that phone,
or something. I don't know.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.740
But I don't want Mother talking to Bucky.

06:00.902 --> 06:04.247
Why not? She's been coming to your rescue
since you were in short pants.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.370
MALORY:
Oh, for-- Sterling, get your things.

06:09.536 --> 06:13.712
We're leaving.
Before this quack's office burns to the ground.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.465
MALORY:
Sterling, get your things.

06:18.628 --> 06:22.974
We're leaving.
Before this cruddy school burns to the ground.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.888
MALORY:
Sterling, get your things.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.477
He's gay.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.516
You were in the Army?
Oh, who remembers?

06:31.683 --> 06:32.809
<i>CYRI L:
Well, try.</i>

06:32.976 --> 06:35.274
PAM:
I can't remember.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.735
There's a reason they call it
"black-out drunk."

06:37.898 --> 06:40.993
If I don't remember that password,
I can't unembezzle that money...

06:41.151 --> 06:43.324
...and then I'm screwed,
because I don't have--

06:43.486 --> 06:45.284
MALORY:
Ten million dollars?

06:45.447 --> 06:47.495
That's outrageous. I won't pay it.

06:47.657 --> 06:51.161
I don't even want the gay back.
So you just better sharpen your pencil.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.581
BUCKY : I don't have <i>pencil.</i>
It's an idiom!

06:53.747 --> 06:57.092
Aw, but I love it when Malory
bails you out of one of your idiot jams.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.345
Oh, really?
Then I get to watch her rub it in your face.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.676
Oh, my God. Okay, first of all--

07:02.839 --> 07:05.058
RILEY: First of all--
Riley, no. Don't say it.

07:05.216 --> 07:09.972
--He's been here voluntarily!
Partying his ass off as king of the pirates!

07:10.555 --> 07:12.728
Hmm. What?
Don't listen to him.

07:12.891 --> 07:16.521
I bet that brain aneurysm
scrambled his Broca's area.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.530
Right? Language center of the brain--

07:22.567 --> 07:23.989
Noah.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.700
Thank you.
No problem.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.241
Actually, not making much progress.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.409
LANA:
You're kidding.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.249
No.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.004
MALORY:
Three million, and not a penny more.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.717
And before you see one thin dime,
I want to talk to Sterling.

07:42.879 --> 07:46.179
Cyril.
Wha--? Hey, Ms. Archer.

07:46.341 --> 07:49.686
Three million in cash?
That, uh, should not be a problem.

07:49.844 --> 07:53.223
I know it shouldn't be,
and it better not be.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.735
Why would it be? It's not.
I just need to move a little money around.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.146
So move it. Today please.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.566
Keep looking,
maybe I wrote it down. Um...

08:02.732 --> 08:04.450
"ArcherSucks." No.

08:04.609 --> 08:07.488
"KillArcherDie." No.
PAM: Um...

08:07.654 --> 08:09.372
Just trying all my usual passwords.

08:09.531 --> 08:12.034
Hey, way to not give them the power.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.535
Thank you.

08:13.702 --> 08:17.252
Do you hear me? I want proof of life.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.249
Duh.

08:19.416 --> 08:22.090
LANA: You lying, pathetic, little piece of--
Ooh.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.299
Lana, no.
ARCHER: Oh...

08:23.461 --> 08:26.010
Come on, you're gonna kill him.
Yup, that's the plan.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.424
Hey, hey, knock it off.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.059
Look, Lana, don't get me wrong,
I like your spunk.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.265
Phrasing.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.557
Shut up. But I promised his mother
that I would bring him home safely.

08:34.722 --> 08:38.523
And I just assume that includes his spleen.
I think that ship might have sailed.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.063
No, not a ship.
That was an idiom.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.652
A helicopter.
There's an old Huey down by the dock...

08:43.815 --> 08:46.739
...and it just so happens,
Rip Riley here can fly it.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.073
No shit?
Yeah.

08:48.236 --> 08:51.991
Rip Riley here can fly anything.
You know, as long as it's got fuel.

08:52.157 --> 08:56.128
Well, Rip, why don't we just look around
for some fuel in this cell...

08:56.286 --> 08:59.961
I doubt they'd keep it in here.
...in which we're still locked?

09:00.206 --> 09:05.588
I figured that we'd kind of work backwards
from the, uh, stealing of the helicopter.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.798
“ArcherBurnFace." No.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.308
"Archerbortion." Ugh.
No.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.346
Are you gonna type random words
in there the rest of your life?

09:13.511 --> 09:17.937
All five minutes of it. At which point, Ms. Archer
will probably dissolve me in a drum of acid...

09:18.099 --> 09:22.570
...unless you have a better idea.
State-dependent memory.

09:22.729 --> 09:26.074
So your plan is for us
to get as black-out, knee-walking...

09:26.232 --> 09:30.408
...shit-faced drunk as we were last night
in the hopes that we remember the password?

09:33.490 --> 09:35.163
Well, don't hog it all.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.293
Pam.

09:37.952 --> 09:41.422
Ah. Seriously,
I bet that would've killed a lesser man.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.925
Ha. There's a lesser man than you?

09:44.084 --> 09:46.837
Uh, yeah, his name's Houdini.
Whom I wish you were.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.131
Yeah, because then I could
just puke up a key.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.675
Because you'd be dead.
Houdini's dead?

09:51.841 --> 09:54.014
You know what?
Yes. Here's what we do.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.271
We lure Bucky down here
and take him hostage.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.773
And then?
Then we'll see. We'll keep it loose.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.527
Oh, for-- And just how the hell
are we supposed to lure him down here?

10:02.685 --> 10:04.107
BUCKY:
Sterling Archer.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.524
What? Sorry, I couldn't hear you
over the sound of my plan working.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.943
Hey, telephone. It's your mother.
My--?

10:10.110 --> 10:13.580
Wait, please tell me you didn't tell her
I was temporarily the pirate king.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.537
No, not yet, but this is damn good. I--

10:16.950 --> 10:18.247
<i>MALORY :
Sterling, are you all right?</i>

10:18.409 --> 10:21.538
No, Mother, I'm a captive of pirates.
Unh!

10:21.704 --> 10:25.709
Oh, and Riley said he no longer
finds you attractive because you're too old.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.877
MALORY: He <i>what?</i>
What? You little--

10:28.044 --> 10:29.421
Son of a bitch!

10:29.587 --> 10:31.134
<i>MALORY:</i>
<i>Was that</i> a <i>gunshot?</i>

10:31.297 --> 10:33.550
Yeah, they got old Ray this time.
BUCKY: Unh! Unh! Unh!

10:33.716 --> 10:35.889
Ray!
Now I kill you.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.520
Aah!
Ow!

10:37.679 --> 10:40.728
Right in the same ear!
MALORY: Ha! <i>Good.</i> Serves you right.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.860
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Malory, I never said that!

10:44.018 --> 10:45.395
<i>MALORY:
You're no spring chicken yourself.</i>

10:45.562 --> 10:47.610
BUCKY: Aah!
LANA: Unh...

10:47.772 --> 10:49.570
Shit.
Lana!

10:49.732 --> 10:51.700
<i>MALORY:
ls Lana hit? Someone talk to me!</i>

10:51.860 --> 10:54.079
Mother, I'm a little busy right now.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.284
Noah!
What?

10:55.446 --> 10:57.323
ARCHER: Spoon him!
What do you mean, spoon him?

10:57.490 --> 11:00.710
You mean, spoon him <i>as</i> in like--?
Oh, uh, right.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.246
Today, please!
BUCKY: Unh!

11:06.875 --> 11:10.175
I am incredibly sorry.

11:13.464 --> 11:17.594
<i>MALORY: Rip? Rip, I take it all back.
You're as strong and sexy as the night we--</i>

11:17.760 --> 11:21.515
For shit's sake, Mother! How short
is the list of guys you haven't screwed?

11:22.891 --> 11:26.521
How dare you?
You can just forget about that ransom.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.108
For once, you're on your own.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.616
<i>ARCHER:
For once? Oh, my God, Columbia Hou--?</i>

11:31.774 --> 11:37.247
All I wanted was to mourn the murder
of my crazy-hot Russian fiancée...

11:37.405 --> 11:39.123
...by becoming a pirate king!

11:39.282 --> 11:42.126
But I guess that was too much to ask!

11:42.285 --> 11:47.382
So Mother can keep her stupid ransom,
because I don't need her!

11:47.540 --> 11:53.593
What I do need
is some fricking crab shampoo!

11:54.714 --> 11:57.183
Noah! Wounded!
No, no, I'm--

11:57.342 --> 11:59.811
Maybe some psychic scarring, yes,
but physically I'm--

11:59.969 --> 12:01.266
Tend to the wounded!

12:01.429 --> 12:05.229
Oh, right, right. Right, of course, of course.
Not him. Start with Lana.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.985
I'm fine. Check on Ray.
ARCHER: Yeah, he is not looking good.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.146
Although, neither is Riley.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.736
And neither is your situation. Ha! Heh-heh.

12:12.899 --> 12:17.826
Because you can forget ransom,
now you and your friends will die here.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.036
Yeah, speaking of forgetting, couple things.
One, these aren't my friends.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.661
Got that right.
I mean her, yes, kind of, maybe...

12:24.827 --> 12:27.296
...but there's a lot of weird sexual tension.
LANA: Ha!

12:27.455 --> 12:31.005
But these other three, whatever, who cares?
I mean, Noah's a slave.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.592
Heh. Yeah, about that--
Noah, not now. And two...

12:34.754 --> 12:37.007
Aha! But I shoot gun many times...

12:37.173 --> 12:40.427
...and in all the excitement,
I lose track myself. Ah.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.348
So now you thinking,
"Did he fire eight shots, or only--?"

12:44.514 --> 12:47.518
Four, idiot. So get your things, we're leaving.

12:47.684 --> 12:51.905
Okay, can I just run up to my hovel quick and
grab the only extant copy of my dissertation?

12:52.063 --> 12:55.442
Noah, still got four bullets.
Oh, God, do you know what "extant" means?

12:55.608 --> 12:57.861
You know what "license to kill" means?

12:58.695 --> 13:00.368
I'll write another one.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.079
The world holds its breath.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.873
LANA:
Ray? Ray, come on honey, stay with me.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.087
Ray? Ray?

13:12.250 --> 13:13.297
Ray?

13:13.459 --> 13:15.962
ARCHER: Not sure that's helping.
Yeah? Well, neither are you!

13:16.129 --> 13:17.722
Lana, I only have two hands.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.598
What I don't have, is all day.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.475
There, I finished. Jeez, damn.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.730
ARCHER: How you doing, Riley?
How the hell do you think I'm doing?

13:25.888 --> 13:29.734
Hey, relax, Nick Furious.
Save your strength for ﬂying the chopper.

13:29.892 --> 13:33.487
And again, I'm just incredibly sorry.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.899
What's your blood type?
Heh. How would I know?

13:36.065 --> 13:38.909
How would you not?
Who am I, Karl Landsteiner?

13:39.068 --> 13:41.070
Discoverer of blood groups?

13:41.237 --> 13:44.582
You don't know your own blood type,
but you know who discovered them.

13:44.741 --> 13:45.913
Yeah, now.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.582
Your exact words, Pam.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.874
"Dr. Charles Drew,
or I will eat a bag of dicks."

13:53.249 --> 13:54.250
Bring them.

13:54.417 --> 13:58.263
And not to diminish the accomplishments
of Dr. Charles Drew, but--

13:58.421 --> 14:01.595
Goddamn it, Archer.
Ray needs O-positive blood or he's gonna die.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.762
So give him some of yours.
I'm A-negative.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.271
Hey, me too.
And even if Riley is O-positive--

14:07.430 --> 14:10.274
No, I'm A-negative too. Eh? Blow it up.

14:10.433 --> 14:13.437
--He's already a quart low, <i>so...</i>

14:13.603 --> 14:14.604
NOAH:
Oh...

14:14.771 --> 14:17.399
Positive?
Yeah.

14:17.565 --> 14:23.072
One of these days, I swear to God, I'm gonna
burn this place straight down to the ground.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.284
Oh, my God, yes.

14:25.615 --> 14:26.662
What about this Sunday?

14:26.824 --> 14:28.667
Unless you want people in here,
in which case--

14:33.915 --> 14:34.962
CYRIL: Aah!
Five-0. Five-O.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.627
Cyril, never mind moving that money.

14:37.794 --> 14:42.049
What money? Oh, really? You sure?
Because all I need to do is just--

14:42.215 --> 14:45.469
Re-evaluate your entire life.
And yes, I'm sure.

14:45.635 --> 14:49.640
Sterling can get himself out of this jam,
for once.

14:49.806 --> 14:54.607
Oh, and don't be here on Sunday, Pam.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.988
Why just me? What's happening Sunday?

14:57.146 --> 15:00.491
Probably my grisly murder,
because we still haven't found that password.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.152
Did you try "guest"?

15:02.318 --> 15:04.286
No, Pam, I didn't, because I'm not an id--

15:05.655 --> 15:06.656
Oh, eat a dick.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.158
Bring it.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.666
How much of my blood does he need?
I don't know, 10 gills?

15:12.829 --> 15:14.331
What? U.S. or imperial?

15:14.497 --> 15:17.842
Just keep squeezing that gag-ball
that I don't wanna know why you have.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.502
Uh, no, you do not.

15:19.669 --> 15:23.390
You will never make it to the helicopter.
My men will cut you down like dogs.

15:23.548 --> 15:27.178
Thanks, human shield.
Although, where the hell are all your men?

15:27.343 --> 15:28.344
Are you serious?

15:28.511 --> 15:30.309
They're all at the intramural
lacrosse finals.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.563
The what?
Ow!

15:31.722 --> 15:35.192
Lana, shut up. That's today?
Yeah, it's right now. Well, in 10 minutes.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.477
Who's playing?
LANA: Archer.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.521
Uh, the Lax-mi Singhers--

15:39.021 --> 15:40.648
They made it to the finals?
Uh-huh.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.488
--Versus the Archers of Loafcrosse.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.778
What? That's my team.
Archer.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.823
Lana, I'm team captain.
I built that team from nothing, and--

15:47.989 --> 15:50.208
Archer. Ray is dying.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.334
Does that mean so must my dream?

15:52.660 --> 15:57.166
I think it's great that for once you're getting
out of a jam without your mother's help, but--

15:57.582 --> 16:00.836
Not for once, Lana. Hello? Columbia House.

16:01.002 --> 16:03.881
But remember earlier,
when you said you and I were friends?

16:04.046 --> 16:07.346
Of course.
I mean, I know we fight a lot, but...

16:07.508 --> 16:11.058
God, now that I think about it,
you're my only friend.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.392
Uh, wow.

16:12.555 --> 16:15.308
Right?
Yes, Archer, because if you do this--

16:15.475 --> 16:16.897
Please don't make me choose.

16:17.059 --> 16:22.566
--I will never, ever forgive you,
and we will never, ever be friends again.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.414
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

16:30.573 --> 16:33.042
Birds-eye view of lacrosse!

16:33.201 --> 16:36.705
Lana. Lana, we got the face-off.
Hooray.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.589
Now, can we please get out of here?

16:38.748 --> 16:41.467
Because we are totally vulnerable.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.424
ARCHER:
I know, look at our defenders.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.930
LANA:
He's not talking about the defenders.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.762
ARCHER:
The crease, idiots! Guard the crease!

16:48.925 --> 16:50.598
Lurch, what are you doing?

16:50.760 --> 16:53.434
Middies, come on, get in position!

16:53.596 --> 16:58.944
Oh, shit, they are.
No, look, they're all bunched-- Oh. Oh!

16:59.727 --> 17:00.774
Incoming!

17:00.937 --> 17:02.405
Yee...
Oh, no!

17:02.563 --> 17:04.736
Wait, Lana. Don't--
Aah!

17:04.898 --> 17:07.573
Get some! Get some, you sons of bitches!

17:09.945 --> 17:12.415
Suck it!
No!

17:12.573 --> 17:14.200
Hang on.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.123
ARCHER: Lana!
LANA: Archer!

17:17.453 --> 17:18.625
ARCHER: What, Lana?
LANA: I--

17:20.248 --> 17:21.420
Nothing. I got you.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.050
You got me. Well, that's just super.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.883
What the hell is your problem?

17:26.045 --> 17:29.515
My problem, Lana, is you just
Bonnie and Clyded my starting middies.

17:29.674 --> 17:33.144
Archer, they were--
Redshirt freshmen, Lana, who I was grooming.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.430
But now I guess the Archers of Loafcrosse...

17:35.596 --> 17:38.566
...can forget about the South Pacific
lacrosse championships!

17:38.724 --> 17:41.568
Yeah, that's not a thing.
If and when that becomes a thing!

17:41.727 --> 17:45.982
Hey, here's a thing. Your mother doesn't know
you ran away to be a pirate, so--

17:46.148 --> 17:48.822
No. Lana, seriously, she--
She would literally kill you.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.408
Well, figurative-- Yeah, literally.

17:51.571 --> 17:55.826
So now, for the rest of your idiot life,
I've got that on you.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.164
Right? Wow.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.624
NOAH:
Oh, my God.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.757
Just screw already.
Seriously.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.168
Then kill each other. And then shut up.

18:05.334 --> 18:09.589
And then kill each other again.
And call me, so I can watch you do it.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.183
MALORY:
Sterling, I don't know how you did it, but--

18:12.341 --> 18:15.345
Well, except for Rip's eye,
you got everyone home in one piece.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.512
ARCHER:
No thanks to you.

18:16.679 --> 18:19.228
Well, it's about time
you did something on your own.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.643
Columbia House Record Club.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.403
Archer, the important thing
is that we're home.

18:24.562 --> 18:28.442
And that we spare Malory the details
of your time on Pirate Island.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.201
WW. what happened?

18:30.359 --> 18:34.739
Nothing. Well, you know,
besides a lot of, um, pretty horrific torture...

18:34.905 --> 18:38.125
...which, Mother, if you had seen,
would have broken your heart.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.127
But why dwell on that? We're home.

18:40.286 --> 18:43.790
And my mourning period for, um...
Katya?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.675
Is over. So, hey, it's a happy ending.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.843
Yeah. Yeah, it's just a big old
goddamn fairy tale.

18:51.005 --> 18:54.726
Fairy tale? Uh, phrasing?

18:55.051 --> 18:58.555
Ray, I'm kidding. Don't be like that.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.225
CHERYL:
Ugh, gross. Keep it moving, cripple.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.736
GILLETTE: Shut up.
Ray? Ray.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.689
Ray?

19:08.397 --> 19:11.025
Oh, okay. Then I guess just pout.
