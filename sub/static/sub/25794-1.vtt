<span style= "style. default_1" >My
fellow citizens, at noon today,</span>

03:28.082 --> 03:30.332

<span style="style. default_1">And
about what it means</span> <span

03:38.915 --> 03:40.654
style="style. default_1">for the
security of the United States.</span>

03:40.678 --> 03:41.864
Let's go, Joe.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.357
<span style="style. default_1">
And to our hopes</span> <span

03:43.369 --> 03:44.849

peace in the world.</span>

03:45.725 --> 03:47.528
<span style="style. default_1">Korea

<span style="style. default_1">thousands

<span style="style. default_1">But
what is happening there</span>

03:51.836 --> 03:53.775
<span style="style. default_1">is
important to every American.</span>

03:54.817 --> 03:56.319
What do you mean you
need to go back?

03:56.569 --> 03:58.797
You're just gonna have to
get out of it somehow!

03:58.821 --> 04:01.258
You've done enough, Joe!
Your leg...

04:01.282 --> 04:05.262
We've been through this. I
can't serve if I can't fight.

04:05.286 --> 04:09.099
I got to go and play for the boys.
The whole band is going, babe.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.501
I... I don't have a choice.

05:50.933 --> 05:51.933
Shit!

05:52.226 --> 05:54.771
- Well done, Archibald.
- That's Charlie Parker, man.

05:55.021 --> 05:58.024
You'll be fine. I'm sure
Bird screws up all the time.

05:59.776 --> 06:00.860
Come on, let's go again.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.660
What?

06:51.786 --> 06:55.891
- I blew it. Again.
- See, there's your mistake, Arch.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.334
You're supposed to blow it.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.524
Well, I could use a beer.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.267
Joey, where did you
get this shit?

07:14.684 --> 07:16.578
It sounds like something
my grandma listens to.

07:16.602 --> 07:17.602
Thrift store.

07:17.812 --> 07:22.167
"The Pearls." Jelly Roll Morton.
1935. It's pretty good, huh?

07:22.191 --> 07:25.921
No, Jerry Lee Lewis is pretty good.
This... this is pretty stale.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.865
I don't know. I like it.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.343
We can check out
Bay River tonight.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.762
I took Jenny Tannenbaum
to the Bay last Saturday.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.246
Yeah, we know, Bud.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.558
There's probably a lot of
single dames out there.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.125
Come on, Lou. Bay
River's getting old.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.770
Chasing beautiful women
will never get old, Joe.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.481
Good thing, 'cause you're
never gonna catch one.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.968
- I'm out.
- Ah!

07:49.260 --> 07:50.720
Oh, shit.

07:51.554 --> 07:52.554
Are we out of booze?

07:53.806 --> 07:55.683
Loser's gotta pick up.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.912
Mmm. if Joe's leaving, I'm
turning on the radio.

07:58.936 --> 08:01.647
I think there's some gin left
over from a couple of weeks ago.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.775
- Where?
- In the bar. He barely touched it.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.368
Yo! Yo! Sammy!

08:15.453 --> 08:18.122
Look at this college boy.
Are you back for break?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.708
Tony, this is Gene. She
came down for the week.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.604
Hi, Gene. Where you from?

08:23.628 --> 08:27.048
She's from up north. We met at Berkeley.
Don't hold it against her, though.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.133
Sam, I don't think
I could if tried.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.820
Gene, this is Tony Pacarelli,

08:31.844 --> 08:34.448
Frankie Calabrese,
Two-Eye Tallucci,

08:34.472 --> 08:35.640
Rocco the Fish.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.100
And that's Wendell.

08:38.267 --> 08:39.769
Wendell Gleeson.

08:40.477 --> 08:41.812
Pleasure's all mine.

08:47.401 --> 08:50.530
So Richie McGillicuddy decides he's gonna
climb the gate to get into the party.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.633
Completely loaded, obviously.

08:52.657 --> 08:56.553
So he gets to the top. He's almost there.
I mean, he is so close.

08:56.577 --> 08:59.973
And the guy completely wipes out.
Lands right on the family jewels.

08:59.997 --> 09:02.893
But get this, the gate
was open the whole time.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.525
It's not your fault
you're a ditz, Arch.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.609
Got it.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.277
- Whatever.
- No, seriously,

09:12.301 --> 09:15.096
these things run in families. You
just inherited the ditz gene.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.306
Didn't mean it, Arch.

09:20.434 --> 09:23.229
- You think Cindy Merkle likes musicians?
- Cindy Merkle?

09:24.355 --> 09:25.355
Remind me again.

09:25.606 --> 09:28.192
If she was on a sinking ship, she
wouldn't need a life jacket.

09:29.026 --> 09:31.255
Okay, I definitely
know Cindy Merkle.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.194
<span style="style. default_1">

10:03.394 --> 10:04.621
Did you guys hear that?

10:04.645 --> 10:07.082
- Yeah, we saw it, too.
- What the hell, man?

10:07.106 --> 10:10.419
- Pope is in town.
- Who gives a rat's ass about the Pope?

10:10.443 --> 10:12.486
Not the Bishop of Rome.
Pope Dixon.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.363
Who's the Bishop of Rome?

10:14.739 --> 10:16.508
You're an idiot. You
know that, right?

10:16.532 --> 10:19.243
- The musician, Pope Dixon!
- That's great and all,

10:19.619 --> 10:21.120
but did you have to
spill the bottle?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.932
It doesn't matter, all right?
This is more important.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.935
- More important than booze?
- Look, Joe, I know Pope's your idol,

10:26.959 --> 10:29.646
but I have to talk to
Cindy Merkle tonight.

10:29.670 --> 10:33.275
Cindy will be in LA for the
rest of her life, Lou.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.028
Pope is in town for one night only.
This might be the last.

10:36.052 --> 10:40.949
- I mean, who knows? He's getting up there.
- Joseph, Cindy is newly single.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.409
All right? The clock is ticking.

10:42.433 --> 10:46.038
There are dozens of young,
eligible bachelors like myself

10:46.062 --> 10:47.438
going out tonight
for one reason.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.732
You mean two reasons.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.668
Okay. But seriously, how are
we gonna get more booze?

10:51.692 --> 10:54.195
- It doesn't matter. Pope is in town.
- No!

10:54.362 --> 10:56.656
We need Sam if we
wanna keep drinking.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.884
What are we waiting for?
Sam's at Heart's, isn't he?

10:58.908 --> 11:01.261
If we're gonna get a cab to Central,
we'll have to head that way anyway.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.285
Uh, listen.

11:02.620 --> 11:06.916
You guys might need hooch to go out,
but I can woo Merkle stone-cold sober.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.561
That's your fourth beer.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.587
Unlike you, Bud, I
can hold my liquor.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.860
What?

11:16.884 --> 11:17.885
What?

11:18.844 --> 11:20.554
Cindy's gotta be at Heart's.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.556
- You just saying that?
- No.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.184
I'm sure of it. Everyone
is back in town.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.523
You think she's with a guy?

11:30.898 --> 11:33.109
I don't know. Probably not?

11:33.442 --> 11:35.462
I gotta know if she's with a guy.
All right?

11:35.486 --> 11:38.590
I can't walk in there with a plan and
then she's standing there with a guy

11:38.614 --> 11:42.219
then I'm standing there looking like a
real ass and I've got nothing to do.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.661
Jesus, Lou. You writing a book?

11:45.621 --> 11:49.125
- Bud, you think she's with a guy?
- No.

11:50.668 --> 11:53.546
- I bet she's with five.
- Come on, Lou.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.339
She's probably by herself.

11:56.298 --> 11:57.758
You won't know unless you go.

anything about Pope Dixon

playing on Central tonight.

broke our only bottle of booze.

Hmm.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.621
I knew you played the piano.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.874
I didn't know you were
a fan of the classics.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.750
Oh, of course. Dixon's a legend.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.776
Oh, yeah.

12:58.736 --> 13:02.114
You know, if I didn't have to work
so late, I'd go see him with you.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.844
This damn rock-and-roll music
is messing with my head.

13:08.662 --> 13:12.875
- Have... have you ever been to Central?
- Oh, yeah. I've...

13:13.167 --> 13:16.378
Mmm, must be 10 years ago now.

13:16.837 --> 13:19.423
We used to go to this
club called the...

13:20.299 --> 13:21.299
the Tritone.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.261
And then after that
we'd go to the Dunbar.

13:24.637 --> 13:28.974
The old Dunbar Hotel. Oh, you
should have seen it, Joe.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.852
It was the finest black
hotel in the country.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.605
- All the greats stayed there.
- Mmm.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.441
Your mother know you're going
down there on a Friday night?

13:38.108 --> 13:39.860
Uh, of course.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.881
Of course.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.699
You know, I have an excellent
ear for bullshit, Mr. Grover.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.012
Okay, look, I'm just trying
to have a little fun, okay?

13:49.036 --> 13:50.889
Joey's talking about
going to Central Avenue

13:50.913 --> 13:53.958
and I'm not going down there
unless I've got... booze.

13:54.750 --> 13:55.727
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.897
I was a professional
bullshitter once upon a time.

13:58.921 --> 13:59.898
Yeah.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.691
- Mr. Hubbard.
- Hey, Sam.

14:01.715 --> 14:04.718
- Will you excuse us for a moment?
- Oh, of course. Just be good.

14:07.221 --> 14:10.641
Your moron friend seems to think you're
all going to South Central tonight?

14:11.100 --> 14:12.935
Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.955
Thinking about going to
see Pope Dixon tonight.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.207
Here we go again with this shit.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.167
Come on, Sam. The guy's my hero.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.127
And he's in town, all right?
He's never in town.

14:21.151 --> 14:24.047
You really think that's a good idea?
You on Central Avenue?

Anyway, weren't you supposed
to be grounded this weekend?

14:43.507 --> 14:44.507
No.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.135
No, that was last Friday.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.864
Taking advantage of Ma
'cause she's out of town.

14:48.888 --> 14:49.888
I'm not.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.367

Hey, uh, boys, this is Clarence.
He likes to be called "Bud."

15:12.202 --> 15:15.473
- He's Deborah's little brother.

15:15.497 --> 15:19.126
Mmm. Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.
Mmm.

15:20.878 --> 15:24.983
Look, I got the good fortune of making
sure you don't die this weekend.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.569
So that means your ass is
either home or on the can.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.887
- Sam, come on.
- Why is it so damn urgent?

15:30.346 --> 15:32.026
I'm sure Pope will be
back in LA sometime.

15:32.264 --> 15:35.643
You don't understand.
Pope's getting older.

15:36.101 --> 15:39.647
He's not gonna be around forever, and
when he goes, jazz goes with him.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.400
- Just tell me this isn't about...
- It's not.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.986
Hey. Uh, hey.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.448
I... Can you buy me a beer?

15:50.658 --> 15:51.825
Look around you.

15:53.410 --> 15:56.914
This, this is where you wanna be.
Huh?

15:58.457 --> 16:00.542
This girl right here
keeps looking at you.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.795
Go talk to her.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.300
Merkle?

16:09.343 --> 16:11.053
How's college treatin' ya?

16:11.512 --> 16:12.888
Just swell.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.391
How's high school treatin' ya?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.060
Swell.

Okay. Come on, Mr. Hubbard. I
know you keep beer back there.

17:31.717 --> 17:35.196
Archibald, I have known
you your whole life.

17:35.220 --> 17:40.035
I know that you're 17. What
would your mother think?

17:40.059 --> 17:42.186
She'd understand. She
drinks all the time.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.541
Cindy, you've had a
boyfriend for three years.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.565
You're cute,

17:47.608 --> 17:50.295
you have a decent personality,
but you're no Monroe.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.904
Let's be honest.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.949
So why don't we just have
some fun tonight, huh?

17:59.286 --> 18:01.914
You think you're real
suave, don't you, Dewey?

18:03.332 --> 18:04.541
Louie.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.502
That's what I said.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.003
Dewey.

18:12.007 --> 18:15.219
What, you feelin' it yet, Garby?

18:15.969 --> 18:16.804
I got...

18:16.970 --> 18:19.824
Yeah, I think he's feeling it.

18:19.848 --> 18:22.202
Oh! Oh, no!

18:22.226 --> 18:23.870
He upchucked in the glass.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.997
You can go, thank you.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.682
Let's get out of here, Archie.

18:31.401 --> 18:34.363
- Back here at 11:00, right?
- Sounds good.

18:41.703 --> 18:45.475
- What the hell, Bud?
- Told ya he couldn't hold his liquor.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.977
- Ugh, what is that?
- Is that chaw?

18:48.001 --> 18:50.629
Don't worry, I'm all right now.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.174
Yeah. Take a stick, please.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.677
Gonna need this for later.

18:57.469 --> 19:01.348
You know, maybe we all could
go get a drink on Central.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.852
If my dad knew we went to
South Central, he'd...

19:06.979 --> 19:08.564
I don't know, I
don't wanna know.

19:09.273 --> 19:13.962
If we all went down to Bay River,
as usual, what's to find out?

19:13.986 --> 19:16.780
Mmm, I gotta be back
here for Merkle.

19:17.447 --> 19:21.094
Come on, let's check it out. Let's
do something different, for once.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.847
I mean this is the Pope
Dixon we're talking about.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.623
Archie, Donnie Hodges
played with Pope.

19:27.124 --> 19:30.043
Bud, Wellman Broad
was in his band.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.755
And Cooper might be there, too.
They all might.

19:35.507 --> 19:36.633
Fine.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.695
But she better be
here when I get back.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.072
Oh, no, she's probably running
for the hills as we speak.

19:45.809 --> 19:49.396
- We're just playing with you, Lou.
- Guys, guys! Hey! Hey!

19:52.482 --> 19:53.482
Central Avenue.

19:56.737 --> 19:59.907
- Quick, go! Go! Go! Go!
- Joey!

drive a little while

20:18.634 --> 20:21.178
- and I'll let you know...
- I ain't no tour guide, kid.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.387
Get out!

20:33.106 --> 20:34.816
Where the hell are
we supposed to go?

20:36.026 --> 20:37.736
Well, we're not going that way.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.447
That's where we gotta
go, right there.

20:41.698 --> 20:45.011
This is just swell, Joe.
Great Friday night.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.871
We just gotta find someone who
knows where this place is.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.540
Wait.

20:54.127 --> 20:57.023
- Excuse me, ma'am. Uh...
- Oh, Lord.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.047
Ma'am, do you...?

20:58.298 --> 21:01.426
- Do you know where the...?
- No. No, I don't.

21:09.768 --> 21:14.749
Okay, well, Bud's right. We should
go that way towards the lights.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.751
I'm sure he's down
there somewhere.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.528
It always takes you guys so
long to figure out I'm right.

21:19.736 --> 21:22.030
And when have you
been right, ever?

21:22.656 --> 21:24.283
I called the rise
of Fidel Castro.

21:24.866 --> 21:27.011
I called<span style= "style. default_1"
> Gigi</span> winning Best Picture.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.722
I called the Dodgers
beating the Sox in six.

21:29.746 --> 21:31.182
You had the Sox in four.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.850
You literally said the Dodgers
would never win in LA.

21:32.874 --> 21:34.811
That was before Sherry went off.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.396
- I can keep going.
- Please don't.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.630
Hey, these guys look our age.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.509
Hey, hey, excuse me?

21:42.801 --> 21:45.721
Hey, guys, do you, uh, do you
know where the Tritone is?

21:46.305 --> 21:49.242
The Tri? What is
this, April Fools?

21:49.266 --> 21:51.935
We, uh, heard Pope Dixon
is playing there.

21:52.602 --> 21:56.189
- Pope Dixon?
- Come on, y'all. We're gonna miss Otis.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.525
- Who's Otis?
- Johnny Otis?

21:58.859 --> 22:01.111
Oh, this is just sad, man.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.697
You know R&amp;B?

22:04.323 --> 22:08.118
Do these cats look like they
got any rhythm or blues?

22:10.203 --> 22:12.223
Just the blues, I guess.

22:12.247 --> 22:14.082
Let's roll out, man.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.173
Let's go.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.858
When I get my hands
on that kid...

22:40.108 --> 22:41.651
He's not a kid, Sam.

22:42.319 --> 22:45.548
You don't know my brother, Gene.
He's gonna get killed.

22:45.572 --> 22:48.158
Unless I find him first
and kill him myself.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.870
Shit!

23:02.547 --> 23:03.733
You watching this?

23:03.757 --> 23:05.777
I already gave it a quarter.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.135
Gimme one of yours.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.471
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

23:09.846 --> 23:11.890
Look, I need to borrow your car.
I'll be right back.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.576
My ride's in the shop.
It won't take long.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.494
- Sam...
- I promise.

23:14.518 --> 23:17.145
Sam, no one drives
"The Bagel" but me.

23:17.729 --> 23:18.814

23:19.981 --> 23:21.024

23:24.236 --> 23:25.821
Yeah, you're real tough.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.950
How do you feel about a
trip to South Central?

23:34.454 --> 23:37.165

days about the end of the world?

no more mom jokes.

Guys.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.528
That sounds promising, huh, Joe?

24:06.903 --> 24:08.280

24:08.655 --> 24:10.031
It's got to be, right?

25:10.425 --> 25:13.261
Central ain't what she used to be.
Well...

25:13.386 --> 25:15.889
well, sometimes
good things pass.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.807
But, uh, we like to think, uh...

25:18.808 --> 25:21.561
this place here ain't
changed much since '29.

25:22.312 --> 25:25.917
Now, uh, we might be closing
down next year, but...

25:26.900 --> 25:30.254

the music ain't stopping.

25:33.573 --> 25:34.759
That's what I'm talking about.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.802
- We gonna go all night.
- That's right!

25:36.826 --> 25:38.638
We gonna go all mornin'. Hell,

25:38.662 --> 25:40.462
we are gonna go 'til the
globe stops spinning,

25:40.705 --> 25:43.726
'til the kids stop kissin', 'til the
old man in the sea stop fishin'!

25:43.750 --> 25:45.311
What y'all know about that?

25:45.335 --> 25:46.437
Can you hear me now?

25:46.461 --> 25:49.065
Can you hear me?

25:49.089 --> 25:53.319
And, um, on that note, I
wanna call up two cats.

25:53.343 --> 25:58.848
Two cats I call my guy and my

Ava Moore!

29:26.014 --> 29:29.034
- So, what do you think of my wheels, doll?
- Hey, what did you call her?

29:29.058 --> 29:31.686
What? I couldn't hear that, Sammy.
What'd you say?

29:32.145 --> 29:34.689
Easy, Sam, all right?
I'm a big girl.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.667
Oh, oh. Hey, hey,

29:36.691 --> 29:39.712
it's just playground talk. You
know what I mean? It's just...

29:39.736 --> 29:42.197
Hey, so you didn't
answer my question.

29:43.406 --> 29:46.218
I'm more of a Ford girl, myself.

29:46.242 --> 29:48.608
These Italian models are
a little <span style=

29:48.620 --> 29:50.997
"style. default_1" >slick
</span>for my taste.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.708
I know you don't mean that.

29:55.335 --> 29:59.088
I think that maybe you just
need to try it out sometime.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.151
What?

30:06.054 --> 30:07.597
Maybe they know where he is.

30:09.390 --> 30:10.390
Come on.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.593
Hey, uh, sorry to bother you,

30:27.617 --> 30:29.786
but you guys were really
something up there.

30:29.953 --> 30:31.287
Thanks.

30:31.454 --> 30:33.790
- Is it okay if we, uh...?
- Yeah, go ahead.

30:36.125 --> 30:38.628
Ahem. I'm, uh, I'm
Joey and this is Bud.

30:39.295 --> 30:40.295
Hey.

30:41.130 --> 30:44.259
We're jazz musicians, too. We
both thought you were great.

30:44.551 --> 30:45.718
Thank you.

30:46.719 --> 30:49.556
So, what brings you two
down here tonight?

30:49.722 --> 30:51.116
It's just, uh...

30:51.140 --> 30:53.101
We wanted to hear some jazz.

30:53.935 --> 30:56.688
Do you guys happen to know if
Pope Dixon is playing tonight?

30:56.980 --> 30:59.041
Uh, yeah. You missed him.

30:59.065 --> 31:01.234
Yeah, I think he's
heading to another club.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.694
Do you know where?

31:02.986 --> 31:05.154
I'm not sure. Clifford?

31:07.198 --> 31:09.200
I'm pretty sure
it's the Cage Bird.

31:09.659 --> 31:10.743
We can go there later.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.624
- Did you see him?
- Yeah, we saw him.

31:17.750 --> 31:18.835
How was he?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.379
He was...

31:23.006 --> 31:24.382
He was Pope.

31:25.758 --> 31:29.012
Why?

31:29.304 --> 31:30.597
Nothing, man.

31:34.225 --> 31:37.145
Yeah. I know, it's weird.

31:37.353 --> 31:40.189
A couple of white guys
into jazz down in Central.

31:41.274 --> 31:44.861
Oh, no, not weird at all.
Way too common, in fact.

31:45.445 --> 31:46.645
- What do you mean?
- Clifford.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.802
Don't listen to my brother.
He can be a bit of a downer.

31:51.826 --> 31:54.787
Yeah, right, ignore
the "negative Negro."

31:56.581 --> 32:00.436
If you two are such big
jazz fans, tell me this...

32:00.460 --> 32:03.296
How did it start?
In the beginning.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.382
Um...

32:06.966 --> 32:09.218
In New Orleans, right?

32:09.636 --> 32:11.030
It was a mixture of
African and Creole...

32:11.054 --> 32:15.516
Jazz is the product of one
thing, and one thing only.

32:16.517 --> 32:17.852
Slavery.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.855
Minstrel shows and
shit like that.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.375
That's what you see when
Pope Dixon is up there.

32:23.399 --> 32:26.945
Happy, positive Negro smiling, putting
on a show for the white folk.

32:28.696 --> 32:31.491
You know, things ain't changed
much in this country, now.

32:32.408 --> 32:33.576
Not really.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.810
That's not what I see
when I hear Pope,

32:41.834 --> 32:43.646
but I guess I never
thought of it like that.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.129
Of course you didn't.

32:45.713 --> 32:48.007
Even black people don't
think of shit like that.

32:48.549 --> 32:53.364
Yeah, but we're not just watching.
I mean, we play, too.

32:53.388 --> 32:54.657
The music matters to us.

32:56.265 --> 33:00.520
Lots of people swing different from Cliff.
Don't let him get to you.

33:01.854 --> 33:02.939
Now...

33:04.816 --> 33:06.859
Jazz is a thick smoke.

33:07.986 --> 33:11.155
It's a smooth rye,
it's a medicine.

33:12.115 --> 33:15.159
It's a path that gets us
through the forks of life.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.619
Gets us through the struggle.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.330
It's passion.

33:19.914 --> 33:21.207
It's love for each other.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.961
It's happiness and pain.

33:26.212 --> 33:27.338
Exactly.

33:27.630 --> 33:31.092
Jazz is great when it has
that pain behind it.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.554
They've never been
through that struggle.

33:34.804 --> 33:38.182
You really think you've been through
Pope Dixon's struggle, Cliff?

33:38.808 --> 33:40.518
Well, you're right.

33:41.477 --> 33:42.937
We haven't, but...

33:43.896 --> 33:46.899
you just got to keep working until
you get that shot, you know.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.294
And you don't have
to take it from us.

33:49.318 --> 33:51.904
You see Pope tonight,
ask him what he thinks.

33:57.660 --> 33:58.661
So.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.848
You two are in a band?

34:00.872 --> 34:02.433
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:02.457 --> 34:06.377
Us and our two other friends.
They're, uh, around here somewhere.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.795
- And what do you play?
- Bass.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.841
And Joey plays piano.

34:13.134 --> 34:15.821
This guy is gonna
be the next Mingus.

34:15.844 --> 34:17.697
- Oh, is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.993
Well, obviously, I'm nowhere
close to Mingus, but...

34:21.016 --> 34:22.351
You know Mingus' stuff?

34:24.478 --> 34:27.732
- Mingus?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.359
Give me one second.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.241
What's he doing?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.081
You'll see.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.363
- You boys ready?
- For what?

34:58.387 --> 35:00.783
Guess we ain't done just yet.

35:00.807 --> 35:03.851
We got one more request.

35:04.602 --> 35:09.023
We, uh, we're gonna bring up
a couple of rooks to jam.

35:09.315 --> 35:10.542
These boys right here.

35:10.566 --> 35:11.943
What's your name, son?

35:14.987 --> 35:16.072
Joey.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.742
Joey. What do you play, Joey?

35:21.202 --> 35:22.203
Piano.

35:23.037 --> 35:24.539
We got Joey on piano.

35:25.998 --> 35:27.125
How about you, killa?

35:27.917 --> 35:28.917
Bass.

35:31.879 --> 35:33.965
Mighty unusual name for
a young man, "Bass."

35:34.340 --> 35:38.886
- What the hell did they do now?
- Uh, Bud, I play bass.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.347
Bud plays the bass.

35:41.472 --> 35:45.977
Uh, my son will join as well as the
lovely Clara Brown on trumpet.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.622
Here's some of that new,
local Mingus for y'all.

35:48.646 --> 35:49.540
Come on.

35:49.564 --> 35:52.150
All right.

35:54.694 --> 35:57.334
If these cats can't play, Cliff,
it's coming out of your allowance.

35:58.447 --> 35:59.657
Come on, now.

35:59.949 --> 36:01.200
Let's go, Joe.

36:18.259 --> 36:22.138
Why don't you come on down front, killa? I
want everybody to get a good look at ya.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.932
Come on down!

36:26.392 --> 36:27.727
Here's your shot.

36:46.662 --> 36:47.788
Go on.

38:11.831 --> 38:14.041
Oh, the kid on the
drums is fast.

38:15.001 --> 38:17.837
- He's no Krupa.
- No, he's faster than Krupa.

38:25.428 --> 38:26.428
Whoo!

38:30.308 --> 38:31.350
Whoo!

38:37.189 --> 38:38.274
Do you see them?

38:40.985 --> 38:43.070
Sam, can we find this dweeb
and get out of here?

38:43.321 --> 38:44.321
Found him.

38:50.119 --> 38:52.580
- Great, go get him.
- Shut up!

39:16.937 --> 39:18.297
What the heck are
they doing here?

39:28.449 --> 39:29.926
What the fuck was that?

39:29.950 --> 39:33.204
- I'll get him, and you get him.
- Okay.

39:41.420 --> 39:44.382
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

40:09.031 --> 40:11.409
Yeah. All right.

40:12.493 --> 40:13.702
Sorry.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.392
- Hey, hey, Joe, Joe, we gotta go.
- Hey, yeah.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.726
What are you doing? You're
supposed to get Bud.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.627
- I thought you were getting Bud.
- Shit.

40:23.170 --> 40:25.050
Guys, we'll go out the back, all right?
Come on.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.441
Wait, where is he?

40:26.465 --> 40:28.592
Hey, Bud! Meet us
at the next place!

40:29.093 --> 40:31.178
- Thank you! Thank you!
- What the hell?

40:32.972 --> 40:34.140
Y'all leaving?

40:44.692 --> 40:46.360
Bud's gonna meet us
at the Cage Bird,

40:46.777 --> 40:47.796
that's where Pope's playing.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.006
- Where's that?
- Uh, I don't know.

40:50.030 --> 40:51.907
All these places are
around here somewhere.

40:52.283 --> 40:55.637
It's fine. We'll just
keep walking this way.

40:55.661 --> 40:59.498
Christ, Joe, do you see
where we are right now?

41:04.378 --> 41:07.149
Somebody wanna explain to me
what we're doing right now?

41:07.173 --> 41:10.134
Sorry. I just gotta...

41:12.595 --> 41:14.472
I had to get away
from those guys.

41:15.014 --> 41:17.349
Bad news. They're trying to
take us back to Pasadena.

41:18.726 --> 41:21.997
- Wow, that'd be so terrible.
- We lost your friends.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.606
They're going to the Cage Bird.

41:25.816 --> 41:27.735
You mind showing
me where that is?

41:29.862 --> 41:32.656
If it... if it's not too
far or if it's, uh...

41:34.158 --> 41:39.038
- I get if it's crazy.
- Yeah, why not?

41:46.462 --> 41:47.689
What about Pops?

41:47.713 --> 41:49.858
I mean, we just left the
whole band back there.

41:49.882 --> 41:52.343
The set's over. We're
always coming and going.

41:54.386 --> 41:55.971
Let's go.

42:10.486 --> 42:12.130
You guys hear what
Joey said up there?

42:12.154 --> 42:14.508
He said, "Meet us
at the next place."

42:14.532 --> 42:18.011
Oh, "the next place." That's fantastic.
We all know where that is, right?

42:18.035 --> 42:20.316
They couldn't have gone far.
Let's go this way, all right?

42:20.704 --> 42:22.974
Yeah, you go that way.
I'm gonna go to the car.

42:22.998 --> 42:25.185
Yeah, fine. We'll be able to look
for 'em a lot easier in the car.

42:25.209 --> 42:28.271
No, no, we are not looking for your
stupid punk brother anymore, Sam.

42:28.295 --> 42:29.481
We're going to Bay River.

42:29.505 --> 42:32.192
If we don't find Joey, you came
all the way out here for nothing.

42:32.216 --> 42:34.986
I don't give a rat's ass about Joey.
He's not my problem, okay?

42:35.010 --> 42:37.405
You're a real piece of
work, you know that?

42:37.429 --> 42:39.366
- Will you give us a minute?
- Sam?

42:39.390 --> 42:43.561
- You got it...
- Tony, give me a damn minute, please.

42:49.108 --> 42:51.443
Gene, look, I think you
should head back to my place.

42:52.444 --> 42:54.684
We can call you a cab and I
can meet you after I get Joe.

42:55.698 --> 42:57.842
I get that you're annoyed
with your brother.

42:57.866 --> 43:00.035
Gene, you don't understand.

43:01.078 --> 43:02.718
I don't wanna argue
about this right now.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.628
Did you see your
brother's face up there?

43:10.588 --> 43:12.691
Have you ever really watched
him while he played?

43:12.715 --> 43:14.592
I mean, really watched him?

43:14.967 --> 43:16.385
Let's go!

43:20.472 --> 43:26.270
When he was on that stage, he was home,
and he was free and he was happy.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.106
I think you know that.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.942
So I'm staying and
we'll find them.

43:32.651 --> 43:33.651
But...

43:34.486 --> 43:38.782
just don't come down
on him so hard, okay?

43:43.287 --> 43:47.875
Tony, it's okay, you can go. We're
gonna look for him on foot.

43:51.962 --> 43:54.006
Fine, fine! Fine.

43:55.424 --> 43:57.611
Thirty minutes, then I'm gone.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.720
I don't wanna drive around
with you two all night.

44:00.137 --> 44:01.805
Let's find 'em quick, then.

44:02.598 --> 44:05.118
I can't believe we let
you talk us into this.

44:05.142 --> 44:07.811
- Let's just get a cab and go home.
- Feel free.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.272
I'm gonna see Pope
Dixon play tonight.

44:10.397 --> 44:13.918
Yeah, well, I prefer to
see Merkle in my bed.

44:13.942 --> 44:16.945
Okay, come on, Lou,
it's not that bad here.

44:17.571 --> 44:20.759
You can't seriously tell me you're okay
with this, Arch? This place stinks.

44:20.783 --> 44:22.159
Shut up, Lou!

44:24.328 --> 44:25.829
Shut up for one minute.

44:44.431 --> 44:49.728
I'm not just saying this, but
you sound like Etta James.

44:50.145 --> 44:51.373
Better, maybe.

44:51.397 --> 44:56.902
I mean, your voice is so
powerful and silky and...

44:57.861 --> 45:02.366
- Uh, it's just so effortless.
- Did you say "silky," man?

45:03.158 --> 45:04.910
You did not just say "silky."

45:05.744 --> 45:08.747
- That's nice of you.
- Are you kidding me?

45:09.748 --> 45:13.001
After we get there, we're dropping
you off and we're heading back.

45:13.877 --> 45:16.557
You know, I... I don't know why we're
doing this in the first place.

45:19.174 --> 45:20.217
Damn. "Businessmen."

45:22.052 --> 45:24.280
- Are they a gang?
- They're a club.

45:24.304 --> 45:27.057
Just don't look over there, man,
it's already embarrassing enough.

45:28.851 --> 45:30.310
Why, are they your pals?

45:31.603 --> 45:32.896
"They your pals?"

45:35.357 --> 45:37.609
- Do they look like my pals, man?
- Clifford!

45:38.986 --> 45:40.380
Enough with the damn attitude!

45:40.404 --> 45:43.198
- How's he supposed to know?
- He doesn't know shit!

45:43.532 --> 45:45.826
Coming down here for one
night just to get a fix?

45:46.243 --> 45:48.078
That's all it is, Ava,

45:48.370 --> 45:50.747
- to say that they came here once.
- Clifford.

45:51.039 --> 45:53.584
- You know, you're acting like a real...
- Like a real what?

45:53.792 --> 45:56.211
Do you think you're the
only one who's got it bad?

45:56.712 --> 45:59.465
Quit acting like this
world is out to get you.

45:59.923 --> 46:02.718
And stop hating on these boys
just 'cause they're white.

46:03.510 --> 46:06.197
- What if a cop sees you with him?
- I can protect myself.

46:06.221 --> 46:08.390
You won't be the only
one in trouble, Ava.

46:11.268 --> 46:13.896
Let's just get off the street
and into this damn club.

46:15.939 --> 46:17.274
Almost there, Bud.

46:35.417 --> 46:37.211
Hush, now.

47:08.659 --> 47:10.327
Joe, come on.

47:46.071 --> 47:47.155
Joe...?

47:48.115 --> 47:50.993
- Oh, what is he doing?
- Excuse me, ma'am?

47:51.493 --> 47:53.912
Do you mind telling us where
the Cage Bird is, please?

47:58.375 --> 48:00.144
Man, we're not gonna find them.
They're long gone.

48:00.168 --> 48:02.313
They gotta be around
here somewhere.

48:02.337 --> 48:05.299
Well, here we are,
about to get shot.

48:05.507 --> 48:07.569
Maybe they just got a
cab and went home.

48:07.593 --> 48:10.470
They did not go home. And
we're not gonna get shot.

48:12.097 --> 48:13.097
Hey, what is that?

48:13.807 --> 48:16.452
Oh, I got it at the club. The
bartender gave it to me.

48:16.476 --> 48:17.412
It's a guide.

48:17.436 --> 48:20.772
It lists all of the safe places
in LA for colored people.

48:21.732 --> 48:24.735
The only other jazz club in walking
distance from the Tritone...

48:25.068 --> 48:27.237
is, uh, the Cage Bird.

48:27.487 --> 48:30.300
Three blocks up that way.

48:34.703 --> 48:36.246
- Joey!
- Is he here?

48:37.873 --> 48:39.625
You missed him, man,
I'm really sorry.

48:43.462 --> 48:44.671
Hey, where is he?

48:46.923 --> 48:48.175
He went back to his hotel.

48:51.261 --> 48:54.431
You said I missed him.
You saw him?

48:55.641 --> 48:57.267
Sorry, man.

48:58.310 --> 49:01.021
Only the last minute or
so, and then he bailed.

49:03.565 --> 49:05.400
- Damn it.
- Joe!

49:21.875 --> 49:23.126
I'll take a whisky.

49:33.595 --> 49:35.430
So why Pope Dixon?

49:37.349 --> 49:38.349
What?

49:41.812 --> 49:43.897
I said, why Pope Dixon?

49:47.275 --> 49:48.652
He's the best.

49:52.447 --> 49:53.490
That's it?

49:59.913 --> 50:02.124
He was, uh...

50:06.294 --> 50:07.796
my dad's favorite.

50:11.967 --> 50:13.468
Not just that.

50:15.804 --> 50:17.431
He was practically his hero.

50:21.143 --> 50:22.602
He taught me to play.

50:30.777 --> 50:34.364
I knew my dad wanted to be a
famous jazz musician someday.

50:38.076 --> 50:39.453
He used to say,

50:41.580 --> 50:44.040
a good band was like
a flock of birds,

50:45.250 --> 50:46.251
and...

50:47.711 --> 50:51.590
and improv was like a bird leaving
the flock just for a minute.

50:55.552 --> 50:57.179
But it always came back.

51:02.559 --> 51:04.978
I, um... ahem...

51:07.189 --> 51:10.609
Ava and I went through
something similar.

51:13.111 --> 51:14.237
My mom.

51:16.198 --> 51:17.699
She was a singer.

51:21.536 --> 51:23.622
Passed away not too long ago.

51:30.086 --> 51:32.297
Hey, you ain't half
bad on the keys, man.

51:39.846 --> 51:42.116
- Yeah.
- Yes!

51:45.852 --> 51:47.979
That's... that's blues.

51:50.190 --> 51:52.585
What the hell are we still
doing here if Pope's gone?

51:52.609 --> 51:54.049
That's who you wanted
to see, right?

51:54.361 --> 51:57.048
We're here. Might as
well enjoy some jazz.

51:57.072 --> 52:00.367
Some of us have
places to be, Joey.

52:00.575 --> 52:01.575
Then go!

52:02.035 --> 52:03.745
No one's stopping you, Lou.

52:04.037 --> 52:06.122
I can't leave by myself.

52:09.835 --> 52:12.003
Maybe we should talk
in private, Joe.

52:12.796 --> 52:14.047
I don't mind.

52:15.048 --> 52:16.383
What's going on, guys?

52:21.555 --> 52:22.848
He's pretty great, huh?

52:25.433 --> 52:29.145
- I said, he's pretty great, huh?
- He ain't bad.

52:29.312 --> 52:34.025
I can't go by myself because I
don't wanna get shot or mugged.

52:35.694 --> 52:37.334
You really think this
place is dangerous?

52:38.405 --> 52:39.865
People getting shot?

52:40.115 --> 52:41.741
It's <span style= "style. default_1"
>us </span>that are getting shot, man.

52:42.033 --> 52:45.388
Oh, right. The cops are
the dangerous ones.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.289
What the hell's the
matter with you, Lou?

52:49.040 --> 52:51.042
Look, whatever, all right?

52:52.043 --> 52:53.753
These people here...

52:54.880 --> 52:56.482
are trying to listen
to some jazz.

52:56.506 --> 53:00.260
Screw these people.
And screw jazz!

53:00.510 --> 53:02.846
Why are we still
playing jazz music?

53:03.263 --> 53:06.242
Every girl I meet,
it's an embarrassment.

53:06.266 --> 53:09.787
I can't explain it to them other than
my friends are trying to be black!

53:09.811 --> 53:12.314
All right, it's definitely
time for you to go.

53:20.071 --> 53:21.823
Okay, wait here, all right?

53:22.115 --> 53:23.835
I don't wanna scare them
off like last time.

53:23.909 --> 53:27.704
I don't believe this shit. Is
this because of Cindy Merkle?

53:27.913 --> 53:29.557
You love jazz.

53:29.581 --> 53:31.142
You guys thought I loved jazz,

53:31.166 --> 53:32.935
I've just been waiting
for you to catch up.

53:32.959 --> 53:36.922
- This looks bad.
- Nah, I'm sure it's fine.

53:38.006 --> 53:39.049
Hey, Gene.

53:39.925 --> 53:42.928
Sam's a really sweet guy, I
get it, but he's a loser.

53:44.304 --> 53:46.866
Why don't you let me take you
down to Bay River, huh? Hmm?

53:46.890 --> 53:47.890
Get off me!

53:48.767 --> 53:50.685
- Jeez.
- What are you doing?

53:50.894 --> 53:53.647
Seriously, Lou, either shut up
or get the hell out of here!

53:53.939 --> 53:55.458
I went along for the ride.

53:55.482 --> 53:57.651
We're going back to Heart's!
Now, let's go!

53:57.817 --> 53:59.611
You're being a goddamn child.

54:01.780 --> 54:06.117
Look who's calling me childish...
The nigger lover.

54:08.954 --> 54:10.181
Back off.

54:13.875 --> 54:14.918
Say that again, man?

54:15.502 --> 54:16.962
Hey!

54:24.094 --> 54:25.321
Hey, y'all. Come on, now.

54:25.345 --> 54:27.847
What y'all doing? Get up!

54:28.098 --> 54:30.225
Coming in here, causin' trouble.
Go on out!

54:31.184 --> 54:34.455
Get on out! You, too! Come on!

54:34.479 --> 54:38.668
- Hey, back off!
- Leave! Go on! All of you!

54:38.692 --> 54:41.194
Acting like you crazy in here!
What's wrong with you?

54:43.321 --> 54:44.781
- Stop it!
- Come on, man!

54:45.448 --> 54:47.659
You guys are
embarrassing yourselves.

54:48.576 --> 54:50.304
- Enough!
- What the hell happened in there?

54:50.328 --> 54:52.848
- Man, ask your friend.
- Hey! We're not all like that.

54:52.872 --> 54:57.127
- What are you talking about?
- I'm tired of this goddamn place!

54:57.544 --> 54:58.544
Lou?

54:59.713 --> 55:02.465
- What in God's name?
- It's time to go, sis.

55:02.716 --> 55:05.635
Hey, look, I'm sorry we caused
all this trouble, all right?

55:06.261 --> 55:08.638
It's time for everyone to go
home before the cops show up.

55:10.724 --> 55:12.201
- Come on, Joey, we're leaving.
- I'm not going.

55:12.225 --> 55:16.372
Oh, Jesus Christ, Joe! He's gone.
Just give it up, already!

55:16.396 --> 55:18.106
It doesn't matter, all right?

55:18.898 --> 55:22.068
Look, I'll go to the hotel, to the Dunbar.
He's probably playing there!

55:22.193 --> 55:23.921
- Insane!
- We've come this far!

55:23.945 --> 55:26.448
How many times do I have to tell you, Joe?
It's not safe here!

55:26.614 --> 55:28.050
You know, I've heard
enough of that shit, man.

55:28.074 --> 55:29.492
So have I!

55:30.076 --> 55:32.829
I'm going home, Sam, okay?
I'm going home.

55:33.496 --> 55:36.499
Yeah, I'm going with you.
You got a car, right?

55:39.627 --> 55:41.046
Yeah, whatever. Let's roll.

55:41.546 --> 55:45.508
- Hey, just give me a second, Tony!
- I've given you hours, man!

55:45.967 --> 55:48.487
And now I'm late for
Merkle, so I'm gonna go.

55:48.511 --> 55:50.346
What... Cindy Merkle?

55:50.597 --> 55:52.057
Yeah, that's the one.

55:52.932 --> 55:54.517
Move your ass. Come on!

55:55.435 --> 55:57.020
All right, Ava, let's go.

55:58.229 --> 55:59.898
What happened in there?

56:03.151 --> 56:04.152
He...

56:09.157 --> 56:12.660
he called you a nigger in
front of my face, okay?

56:14.287 --> 56:15.121
And he stood up for him.

56:15.288 --> 56:16.599
No, I didn't hear him say that.

56:16.623 --> 56:18.263
- I saw you punch him!
- Clifford, please!

56:20.085 --> 56:23.421
I didn't even know he was like
that, none of us did. And I...

56:24.214 --> 56:27.383
I just... I've really enjoyed
getting to know you.

56:28.468 --> 56:30.428
Both of you. And...

56:31.054 --> 56:35.433
I know we made a mess of things
tonight but I don't want this to end.

56:37.143 --> 56:40.605
- Not like this.
- Pfft, save it, man.

56:41.815 --> 56:44.234
Do whatever you want, Ava.
I'm going back.

56:49.572 --> 56:51.658
Maybe you guys
should just call it.

57:09.092 --> 57:11.553
I'm really sorry, Gene. I...

57:12.220 --> 57:13.680
I didn't mean to...

57:16.349 --> 57:20.770
I saw a pay phone on the corner.
I'll go try to call a cab.

57:43.209 --> 57:45.170
Joey, I get it, all right? I do.

57:47.130 --> 57:48.882
But you got to move on.

57:49.257 --> 57:51.134
Don't tell me to move on.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.680
We're not the only guys
our age who like jazz.

58:01.853 --> 58:04.939
You can chase Pope Dixon
across the entire city,

58:07.650 --> 58:10.153
but it's still not
gonna bring Dad back.

58:15.742 --> 58:17.452
It's not about that.

58:19.787 --> 58:21.498
You should go with
your girlfriend.

58:22.582 --> 58:24.000
Seriously, go.

58:32.383 --> 58:35.970
For the cab ride back, but
I guess I can't force you.

58:40.600 --> 58:42.685
Garby, Radbourn.

58:52.320 --> 58:53.797
Well, I'm...

58:53.821 --> 58:55.990
I'm gonna go grab my jacket.

58:56.991 --> 58:58.243
Uh...

58:59.994 --> 59:01.996
Ask somebody where
the Dunbar is?

59:10.255 --> 59:11.881
Ahem.

59:29.148 --> 59:31.276
We're not going to
the damn Dunbar.

59:35.488 --> 59:37.365
Are you sure? Just now?

59:40.118 --> 59:41.703
I'm such an idiot, Bud.

59:44.080 --> 59:46.416
I dragged us all down
here, and for what?

59:49.460 --> 59:51.087
Even if we did see him,

59:53.047 --> 59:55.008
and you guys even
wanted to come,

59:56.467 --> 59:57.653
it was all for me.

59:57.677 --> 01:00:00.531
You think I wouldn't kill for a
chance to see the king of jazz?

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:02.324
- That Archie wouldn't?
- Louie doesn't give a shit.

01:00:02.348 --> 01:00:04.309
- Who cares?
- That's for sure.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:10.773
Come on.

01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:14.819
Let's go check out the Dunbar.

01:00:15.194 --> 01:00:17.947
- You never know if Pope's still there...
- What's the point?

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.118
If he's there, he's...

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:25.955
he's probably passed out.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:31.002
I bet that he's there,

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:34.088
playing in some back room.

01:00:35.256 --> 01:00:37.568
He probably doesn't stop
until the sun comes up.

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:39.636
Yeah. Well...

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:46.118
Somehow I doubt we'd be
welcome in "some back room."

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:51.356
- Or anywhere around here after tonight.
- Well, you could talk to him.

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:55.318
You had that question
you wanted to ask him.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.577
Except I already
know the answer.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:10.667
Clifford was right.

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:16.506
I have no idea what
that's like, Bud.

01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:21.260
And I have no business
trying to be like them.

01:01:22.553 --> 01:01:25.264
You've been through some
pretty tough times, Joe.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:29.727
- Yeah, nothing like that.
- Losing your dad is pretty damn tough.

01:01:35.149 --> 01:01:37.068
Hell, I don't know
how you do it.

01:01:40.446 --> 01:01:42.407
You are the bravest kid I know.

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:47.096
And the most stubborn.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.723
And you're damn good on the
keys, and you know it.

01:01:49.747 --> 01:01:50.849
God, I don't know.

01:01:50.873 --> 01:01:54.502
Yes. Yes, you are. There is
passion when you play, man.

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:58.923
There's feeling, and that, that
is what makes those guys great.

01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:08.200
So, the bartender told
me where the Dunbar is

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:10.411
and he said never to come back.

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:12.895
And he, uh, he told
me my fly was down.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.565
Which it was.

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:22.071
So, what do you say, Joe?

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:30.788
What about Ava and Clifford?

01:02:35.626 --> 01:02:40.339
Archie and I will go back to the Tritone.
See if we can make peace with Clifford.

01:02:41.048 --> 01:02:42.884
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:47.889
Uh, well, it's, uh, it's only a couple of
blocks down there. Yeah, see that sign?

01:02:48.806 --> 01:02:50.057
That's the Dunbar.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:53.769
All right.

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:56.355
But you gotta go straight
back to the Tritone after.

01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:00.276
And, uh...

01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:04.238
and if you meet
him, if he's there,

01:03:07.575 --> 01:03:10.787
- you'll know what to say.
- Thanks, Bud.

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.752
Hey, hey, tell him
we said hey, too.

01:04:35.621 --> 01:04:37.456
I didn't play, boy.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:43.689
He's all excited, you
know, playing with Pres.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:46.650
After the gig he comes
up to Pres and says,

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:51.864
"Pres, when was the last
time we played together?"

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:55.200
Pres looked at him, "Tonight."

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:11.574
Something I can
help you with, son?

01:05:15.953 --> 01:05:19.081
I'm, uh... I'm...

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:24.170
My name is, uh, Joseph Grover.
I'm a big fan.

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:27.298
Thank you.

01:05:29.717 --> 01:05:33.721
You, uh... you here
all by yourself?

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:39.202
I'm... I'm with some friends.
Just down the street.

01:05:39.226 --> 01:05:40.353
Mm-hmm.

01:05:43.397 --> 01:05:44.815
I... I just...

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:47.693
I love jazz.

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:50.988
I love the history,

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.368
and I grew up listening to
you and your orchestra.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:59.789
It was guys like you who
inspired me to start playing.

01:06:00.247 --> 01:06:02.083
Oh, you play?

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:06.545
What do you play?

01:06:06.837 --> 01:06:09.674
- Piano.
- Piano?

01:06:10.883 --> 01:06:12.426
Piano man.

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:21.602
Well, uh, piano man, you, uh, you
not from around here, are you?

01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:26.816
No. No. Uh, Pasadena.

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:30.778
My father, he grew
up in Manhattan.

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:35.574
He said he saw you once...
In Harlem, at the Savoy,

01:06:36.617 --> 01:06:38.327
and then once again here.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:41.539
He... he said you were the best.

01:06:45.876 --> 01:06:47.086
Look, I...

01:06:49.046 --> 01:06:53.050
I just wanted to talk to
you, so I could, um...

01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:56.303
so I could ask you something.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:00.599
Well...

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:07.565
if you take any longer asking,
I might not be here answering.

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:14.613
I just...

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:19.803
Breathe, piano man.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:23.080
I wanted to ask... I
wanted to ask if you...

01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:30.254
if you think it's possible
to be a great jazz musician

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:32.965
even if...

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.637
even if you haven't...

01:07:40.806 --> 01:07:42.141
been through the...

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:45.644
the struggle.

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:52.318
Like, if you weren't born in
Harlem or Chicago or Kansas City,

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:56.739
if you didn't have to deal
with the stuff that...

01:07:57.448 --> 01:08:01.994
that you and the other
greats dealt with.

01:08:10.294 --> 01:08:12.088
Let me get this straight,

01:08:13.547 --> 01:08:16.175
so I'm clear.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.654
You standing there,
shivering, asking me

01:08:19.678 --> 01:08:23.140
if you have to struggle to be great?
Or...

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:28.354
are you standing
there, shivering,

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:31.511
asking me if you have
to be <span style=

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:34.151
"style. default_1"
>black</span> to be great?

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:40.616
Here's the thing.

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:47.832
I played with a whole
bunch of white cats.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:50.792
Great ones, you hear me?

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:53.002
Great ones.

01:08:53.754 --> 01:08:57.383
Did they all struggle? Maybe.

01:08:57.925 --> 01:08:58.925
I don't know.

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:02.095
You had to struggle, you
ain't had to struggle,

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:05.283
but you can't go around
looking for bad times.

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:08.495
You do that and you're
trampling on folks

01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:10.688
who ain't got no choice.

01:09:10.895 --> 01:09:14.399
Folks who have to get
up every day and fight.

01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:21.073
You hear me? Only you
know if you got a fight.

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:24.368
But you asking the
wrong question.

01:09:24.535 --> 01:09:27.371
The question you
should be asking is,

01:09:27.705 --> 01:09:34.627
what good is a great jazz musician
in this new world of ours?

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:36.546
Huh?

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:39.716
Jazz, as we know it,

01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:42.428
is...

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:45.596
a memory.

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:53.772
The word "jazz" has been
abused, beaten and raped,

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:56.168
just like the word "art,"

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.753
because expression has
been given liberty

01:09:58.777 --> 01:10:01.822
to express shit
and call it gold.

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:08.412
You know, they... they'll call the
decade that killed jazz "the '60s."

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.099
What good is this new generation

01:10:11.123 --> 01:10:14.168
if they don't even know
the classics anymore?

01:10:14.835 --> 01:10:18.398
Your friends, your buddies
around the corner?

01:10:18.422 --> 01:10:21.800
Well, they're all rock 'n'
rollin', aren't they? Mm-hmm.

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:25.697
And your parents, well, they're sitting
up in the living room with a cocktail,

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:27.699
watching the boob tube,

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:30.517
and you're sitting up
here talking about jazz.

01:10:32.102 --> 01:10:38.067
Son, sometimes you just
have to accept reality

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.985
and move on.

01:10:44.198 --> 01:10:45.783
Do you know what
I'm telling you?

01:10:46.784 --> 01:10:52.331
I'm telling you that you was
born in the wrong decade.

01:10:58.045 --> 01:11:01.465
That answer your
question, piano man?

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:07.638
Yes, sir.

01:11:12.559 --> 01:11:13.686
Thank you.

01:14:51.361 --> 01:14:52.654
He'd be proud.

01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:06.793
Let's get the other guys, huh?

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:22.267
Hey, Joe, Sam.

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:29.292
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:30.400
What's going on?

01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:33.195
Oh, Bud's saying bye to Ava,

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:36.657
and I was waiting on him and then
I was gonna come find you guys.

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:38.242
But, uh, was he there?

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:43.997
No. He wasn't.

01:15:44.915 --> 01:15:46.166
It's all right, though.

01:15:51.004 --> 01:15:52.089
You guys ready?

01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:25.581
Taxi!

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:48.937
Pasadena.
