01:41.968 --> 01:44.027
Mr. Prime Minister, let us sign.

01:44.070 --> 01:46.937
¤ Want a Fanta?
Don't you want a Fanta? ¤

01:46.973 --> 01:48.463
What the hell is going on here?

you suck at carving pumpkins.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.267
Who's the freak?

03:28.808 --> 03:32.005
Quiet. Trick-or-treaters.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.910
Trick or treat? Smell my feet.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.437
Now, now. Be nice.

03:36.249 --> 03:38.581
Milf! Milf, Milf!

03:38.618 --> 03:40.051
- Quiet.
- Milf!

Yeah.

03:47.126 --> 03:49.686
- You idiot!
- Oh, no!

03:49.729 --> 03:52.960
- Boys.
- Trick or treat? Smell my ass!

03:52.999 --> 03:55.524
Shut up, dude.
Let's just smash them.

03:56.369 --> 03:58.394
Holy f... ing ass crackers!

04:02.842 --> 04:05.470
For God's sakes, retard,
call for help!

04:10.283 --> 04:11.944
That is so foul.

04:12.785 --> 04:16.447
Yeah!
Hope they enjoy their crap-o'- lantern.

04:16.488 --> 04:17.649
Smash the other one.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.022
Looks like somebody
already smashed it.

04:20.059 --> 04:21.788
Pumpkin crap is the best.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.724
Shut up.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.828
Jim, I'm gonna need
300 copies of your ass...

04:29.869 --> 04:31.860
...by the 4:00 meeting.
- Yes, sir.

04:31.904 --> 04:34.532
And try to keep your balls
off the glass this time.

04:34.574 --> 04:35.768
- Yes, sir.
- Now!

04:35.808 --> 04:37.207
Yes, sir.

04:37.243 --> 04:42.044
The best spaceship ever
would fly out in space.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.515
It would have fins like a shark...

04:44.550 --> 04:46.211
and a clown for a face.

04:46.252 --> 04:48.152
Its wings have propellers...

04:48.187 --> 04:50.212
its sails catch the breeze.

04:50.256 --> 04:54.192
It runs on marshmallows,
and its wheels are skis.

04:54.227 --> 04:57.856
The pilot is brave,
he drinks like my dad.

04:57.897 --> 05:01.196
He rarely takes showers,
and yells when he's mad.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.828
Billy, what the hell is wrong
with this damn thing?

05:03.870 --> 05:07.101
The steering wheel
is a frickin' pretzel, damn it! Holy shit!

05:07.140 --> 05:10.041
Then it plunges straight into the sun...

05:10.076 --> 05:12.601
and that bastard
is never heard from again.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.580
What? Billy.
Billy, I'm breaking up.

05:15.615 --> 05:17.947
Oh, my God,
it's a sauna in here.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.748
What smells
like burnt marshmallows?

05:20.787 --> 05:24.518
Dear God, I'm sorry
for everything I've ever...

05:27.627 --> 05:31.256
And that's
the best spaceship ever.

05:33.966 --> 05:35.934
Now, children, in a few minutes...

05:35.968 --> 05:39.597
we're gonna find out
who ate the poison cookie.

05:39.639 --> 05:43.370
- Won't that be fun?
- Yeah!

05:49.148 --> 05:52.709
- Horsie!
- Thank goodness you found me!

05:52.752 --> 05:54.811
Little girl, please set me free.

05:54.854 --> 05:58.187
Don't move. I'll be back.

05:59.559 --> 06:02.585
I thought you were getting help.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.721
Those will not cut through the tra...

06:08.201 --> 06:10.260
What the hell are you doing?!

06:11.437 --> 06:14.167
Here. Eat these magic healing oats.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.141
OK.

06:16.175 --> 06:19.838
Smell kind of funny.
Did you drug me?

06:23.516 --> 06:27.384
There. Don't you look pretty!

06:27.420 --> 06:29.888
I'm in a catastrophic amount of pain.

06:29.922 --> 06:33.414
Sunny Muffins,
you're my bestest friend.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.859
My name is Pegasus.

06:36.996 --> 06:38.486
Sunny Muffins.

06:39.165 --> 06:42.532
- Pegasus.
- Your name is Sunny Muffins.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.058
It's Pegasus.

06:44.871 --> 06:49.672
- Oh, God! God, why?
- Sunny Muffins. Say it!

06:49.709 --> 06:52.234
- You bitch!
- Come on. Say it.

06:52.278 --> 06:54.269
Say your name.
What's your name?

06:54.313 --> 06:56.508
- Sunny Muffins.
- What's your name?

06:56.549 --> 06:59.985
My name is Sunny Muffins.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.512
I love you.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.927
- Sunny Muffins.
- Who are you?

07:10.963 --> 07:13.431
Honey Flake, apparently.

07:13.466 --> 07:16.435
Would you like fries with that?
Would you like fries with that?

07:19.939 --> 07:22.931
Would you like flies with that?

07:22.975 --> 07:25.273
Damn it! Damn it!

07:26.979 --> 07:28.879
Good morning, Uncle Gadget.

07:28.915 --> 07:32.180
Muffins!
Go, go, Gadget Butter Knife.

07:35.154 --> 07:36.485
Oh, boy.

07:36.522 --> 07:39.457
- Time to replace that arm.
- "Cyberdyne"?

07:39.492 --> 07:42.325
Uncle Gadget, why aren't
you using your normal parts?

07:42.361 --> 07:45.660
Not to worry, Penny.
I'm always on duty.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.689
That's totally not what I asked.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.436
Skynet 8 on line.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.269
Uncle Gadget, are you all right?

07:54.307 --> 07:57.743
- Uncle Gadget?
- Must terminate.

07:57.777 --> 08:00.803
Go, go, Gadget Circular Saw.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.974
With Skynet on line...

08:06.018 --> 08:08.680
Gadget is under my complete control...

08:08.721 --> 08:11.952
and I'll use him to wipe out
my true nemesis...

08:11.991 --> 08:15.085
that meddlesome
12-year-old niece of his.

08:18.798 --> 08:19.924
Hello.

08:19.966 --> 08:22.594
Yes. This is Dr. Claw.

08:22.635 --> 08:25.832
Well, did the tests
explain all the diarrhea?

08:25.872 --> 08:29.000
Well, no.
The meds don't seem to...

08:29.041 --> 08:30.668
Oh, dear!

08:30.710 --> 08:34.736
Feline leukemia?
How long does he have?

08:34.780 --> 08:39.217
I'm too young to have a license, Brain.
You drive. You're a dog.

08:41.386 --> 08:43.048
I'll plot us a map to safety.

08:43.089 --> 08:46.718
Who bookmarked
Doggone Dog Porn in my browser?!

08:46.759 --> 08:48.158
As if I have to ask?

08:53.833 --> 08:56.734
- Oh, crap!
- Better take evasive action, Brain.

09:15.421 --> 09:17.787
Brain, that's still Uncle Gadget.

09:17.823 --> 09:21.657
We need to remember
that deep down inside...

09:21.694 --> 09:23.594
Ram that son of a bitch!

09:26.666 --> 09:28.896
Uncle Gadget, say something.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.435
- I have a mission for Gadget.
- Perfect!

09:33.472 --> 09:35.736
Wait, that message will self-destruct!

09:35.775 --> 09:36.764
No duh!

09:40.846 --> 09:42.404
Always on duty.

09:42.448 --> 09:46.043
- Always on duty.
- Please, Uncle Gadget, no.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.610
Go, go, go, go, Gadget Mallet.

09:48.654 --> 09:51.555
Go, go, Gadget Skis.

Go, Gadget Nail Clipper.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.934
- Sorry, uncle.
- Go, go, Roller Skates.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.371
Disco Ball.
Roller Skates. Disco Ball.

10:08.207 --> 10:11.438
Go, go, Gadget Lipstick.

10:14.180 --> 10:17.172
Well, at least that's over.

10:21.654 --> 10:26.148
- What did he just say?
- He says there's a storm coming in.

10:26.192 --> 10:27.989
I know.

10:28.027 --> 10:31.656
Give me $4.00 for this photo,
or my father will beat me.

10:31.697 --> 10:33.358
Go, go, Gadget Foot.

10:53.285 --> 10:56.880
I would just like to say
a few words, if I may.

10:56.922 --> 11:00.915
Next time, Gadget. Next time!
