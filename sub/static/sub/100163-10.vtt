09:39.678 --> 09:41.178
[gunshots]

09:45.152 --> 09:47.687
[door creaking]

09:47.721 --> 09:49.522
[door slams]

10:00.567 --> 10:05.437
[both grunting]

10:05.437 --> 10:06.374
All right, who ya workin' for?

10:06.374 --> 10:07.143
[groans]

10:07.143 --> 10:10.576
[coughing]

10:10.610 --> 10:12.879
[gunshot]

10:12.913 --> 10:14.615
Dad! The fuck are ya doin'?

10:14.649 --> 10:16.048
He killed Grandma.

10:16.082 --> 10:17.985
I mean, she was gonna die
shortly anyway,

10:18.019 --> 10:20.019
but that was God's
trigger to pull.

10:20.052 --> 10:22.721
Well, they say, "he works
in mysterious ways".

10:22.755 --> 10:24.591
God doesn't send assassins, Ma.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.427
I was about to find out
who sent this bastard here
to kill me.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.163
Oh, he wasn't here to kill you.

10:30.197 --> 10:34.000
He's here to kill me.

10:34.033 --> 10:36.635
This is your fault.
You've been gamblin' again.

10:36.671 --> 10:38.139
No! I told ya.

10:38.173 --> 10:41.509
Look, it's been hard times.
We were scrapin' by.

10:41.542 --> 10:42.908
I tried to get
into real estate,

10:42.908 --> 10:45.178
but do ya know
how much a pant suit costs?

10:45.178 --> 10:46.178
Three figures!

10:46.178 --> 10:46.947
Oh, Sharon, please.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.548
Look, I took out a loan

10:48.581 --> 10:50.549
from the only mooks
that'd give me one.

10:50.551 --> 10:53.253
The M-O-B. That spells--

10:53.287 --> 10:54.822
I know what it spells, Ma.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.755
Look, if you were in trouble,
why didn't ya call me?

10:56.755 --> 10:58.557
I didn't wanna waste
your minutes.

10:58.557 --> 11:00.995
None of this
is your problem, Harleen.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.730
I'll talk to the mob,
try to reason with them.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.466
They're famous
for bein' reasonable.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.902
They'll kill ya, Nicky!

11:07.933 --> 11:10.004
Then at least the last memory
you'll have of me

11:10.038 --> 11:13.706
is finally doin'
the right thing.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.009
All right, stop!

11:15.043 --> 11:17.009
[groans] I'm comin'.

11:17.043 --> 11:18.880
You're gonna stick up
for your old man?

11:18.913 --> 11:20.748
Hell, no.

11:20.748 --> 11:21.981
I just know
when ya fuck this up,

11:21.981 --> 11:25.720
they'll kill Ma next.

11:25.753 --> 11:26.821
[mobster 1] Aye!

11:26.854 --> 11:29.288
[mobster 2 chuckles] Ooh!

11:29.322 --> 11:30.856
Gabbagool!

11:30.856 --> 11:32.561
All great suggestions for
things we need'a stop sayin'.

11:32.561 --> 11:35.028
Otherwise we're just feedin'
a harmful stereotype.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.065
What are you doing?
Slap ya in the face.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.798
What are you doing?
Get that out of your face.
What is this?

11:38.831 --> 11:39.966
Hey, guys.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.668
I realize
I owe you a buncha money,

11:42.701 --> 11:45.272
[chuckles nervously]
but I'm wonderin'--

11:45.303 --> 11:46.673
-[grunts]
-[groans]

11:46.706 --> 11:49.142
Which one of ya meatballs
killed my grandma?

11:49.176 --> 11:51.211
Whoa! Holy shit!

11:51.245 --> 11:52.413
You're Harley Quinn.

11:52.446 --> 11:53.980
That's right.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.649
So either forgive my dad's debt
or I kill all of ya.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.652
That ain't how
our business works.

11:58.686 --> 12:00.721
Yeah. It's based on loans

12:00.754 --> 12:02.690
and the interest
attached to those loans.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.392
We're servicing
a sector of the community

12:04.426 --> 12:06.725
traditionally ignored
by the financial sector.

12:06.759 --> 12:09.629
Yeah! Bensonhurst
is our turf and I'm not--

12:09.629 --> 12:13.466
-[grunts]
-...gonna ever be able
to chew veal parm again?

12:13.466 --> 12:14.399
You fuggin' bitch.

12:14.399 --> 12:15.701
Hey! Whoa, whoa.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.370
We can be respectful
while killing her.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.354
Get her boys!

12:30.716 --> 12:33.989
Harleen! Front-sault!

12:34.022 --> 12:36.855
[grunts]

12:36.889 --> 12:40.293
Arabian Double Front!

12:40.326 --> 12:42.296
[effort grunt]

12:42.327 --> 12:43.798
[moans]

12:43.831 --> 12:46.432
Backwards salto!

12:46.466 --> 12:48.335
I said backwards!

12:48.368 --> 12:52.807
[grunts]

12:52.840 --> 12:56.009
[chuckles]
Stuck the landing, kiddo.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.399
Oh, I never shoulda

12:57.399 --> 12:58.815
made you lose
that championship, Harleen.

12:58.815 --> 13:02.216
Seeing ya do
that routine perfectly

13:02.250 --> 13:05.619
is better than any
dumb 'ol finger.

13:05.653 --> 13:06.921
I don't know about perfect.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.923
I mean stumbled a little
on the landing.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.125
[door opens]

13:13.158 --> 13:14.509
Get down!

13:21.168 --> 13:23.302
[grunting]

13:23.336 --> 13:26.774
[groans]

13:26.807 --> 13:29.076
Ugh. In case you're wonderin',

13:29.110 --> 13:34.110
[gasps] I'm givin' ya
a double thumbs up, champ.

13:36.485 --> 13:37.485
Oh...

13:37.485 --> 13:39.754
Pollinate me harder...

13:39.787 --> 13:40.821
[moans]

13:40.855 --> 13:43.758
That's all you got? [moans]

13:43.791 --> 13:46.027
Oh... Wh...

13:46.058 --> 13:48.495
Where the hell are we? Chaz!

13:48.528 --> 13:51.432
-Car, car, car! Start the car!
-[engine revving]

13:51.466 --> 13:53.801
-They're coming, let's move it!
-[gunshots]

13:53.832 --> 13:56.903
Get down! [screams]

13:56.937 --> 13:58.440
What the fuck is goin' on?

13:58.471 --> 14:00.041
I thought you were
just a weed dealer.

14:00.072 --> 14:01.475
Weed's legal everywhere, man.

14:01.509 --> 14:04.711
I'm diversifying into
hallucinogenic honey.

14:04.745 --> 14:06.980
Time to GTFO 'ah May-hico.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.817
Mexico? We're supposed
to be in Brooklyn.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.320
Which is basically
next to Mexico.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.922
Stop lickin'
that goddamn honey
and drive this car.

14:14.956 --> 14:17.158
One lick ya see God.

14:17.191 --> 14:21.662
Two licks and ya pass out
with a giant hard... [snoring]

14:21.695 --> 14:23.264
Goddammit, Chaz!

14:23.298 --> 14:25.466
Okay, Frank, you've got this.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.769
-I'm coming, Harley.
-[brakes screech]

14:28.802 --> 14:32.538
Wow. Harley has been
texting nonstop.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.042
This last one says
she feels "ducking awful."

14:35.076 --> 14:37.110
[whispering] I think
she meant the F word.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.249
"I'm super sorry.
I made a mistake.

14:39.282 --> 14:42.850
"I never wanted to hurt you.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.783
"Don't buy those boots."

14:44.783 --> 14:46.287
[sighs]
Well, she's right about that.

14:46.321 --> 14:48.053
I don't think
you can pull off
a kitten heel.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.624
You know what? I bought them,
but I returned them. Okay?

14:49.624 --> 14:51.725
I agree with you. I'm, like,
not a kitten heel person.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.027
Can I just...
Can I have my phone,

14:53.027 --> 14:54.629
so I can...
I can text her goodbye?

14:54.629 --> 14:57.831
Feels like you're gonna ask her
to come save you.

14:57.865 --> 14:59.533
Gus, are you serious?

14:59.533 --> 15:01.700
You really think I would do
something like that to you?

15:01.701 --> 15:03.135
We have built a rapport.

15:03.171 --> 15:05.572
Mmm, yeah. I've seen
a lot of toxic friendships

15:05.605 --> 15:08.908
and the best thing to do
is just cut them loose.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.346
Let me rip that
band-aid off for you.

15:11.379 --> 15:12.745
No, no.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.048
Oh. Okay.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.548
And now I'll text her back.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.216
Oh, shit.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.620
Oh! Ya shoulda seen
my daughter.

15:19.653 --> 15:22.221
Doin' cartwheels,
stabbin' guys in the throat.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.758
Ah. Oh, I was so proud.

15:24.792 --> 15:26.994
Dad, ya...ya saved my life.

15:27.028 --> 15:29.096
Which is very
un-piece of shit like.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.697
I'm tellin' ya,
your father's changed.

15:31.730 --> 15:34.067
He gave his good thumb for you.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.471
Worth it for my daughter.
[chuckles]

15:37.504 --> 15:40.105
[grimacing]

15:40.139 --> 15:42.676
Ugh, thumbs are overrated.

15:42.710 --> 15:44.312
I love you.

15:44.345 --> 15:47.748
It's been so nice
havin' ya here, honey.

15:47.779 --> 15:49.548
Sad to see ya go tomorrow.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.981
[cell vibrating]

15:55.754 --> 15:57.225
I don't know. [exhales]

15:57.258 --> 15:59.192
There's nobody really
waitin' for me in Gotham.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.894
I came here hopin'
to spend some time with Ma,

16:00.894 --> 16:04.065
but actually kind of glad
we could all be here together.

16:04.096 --> 16:05.365
[knocking at door]

16:05.399 --> 16:08.033
There she is.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.403
-Grandpa?
-Well,

16:09.437 --> 16:12.572
I heard you were in town
and Grandma's dead.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.375
Two reasons to celebrate.

16:14.408 --> 16:17.610
Also, got a checkup
at the doc yesterday.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.014
Says my blood pressure's
through the roof.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.950
[inhales] Not sure
how much longer I got.

16:22.981 --> 16:24.951
So let's drink.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.653
[grunts]

16:26.687 --> 16:28.923
That blood pressure's no joke!

16:28.956 --> 16:30.306
[crashes]

16:34.561 --> 16:37.599
[grunting]

16:37.630 --> 16:39.567
[Harleen] Ha!

16:39.601 --> 16:41.836
[both grunting]

16:41.869 --> 16:44.238
Oh, my God!

16:44.272 --> 16:46.673
Jesus!
The mob's never gonna stop.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.243
But as long as I'm here,
I'm gonna keep my family safe.

16:49.277 --> 16:50.711
-[gunshot]
-[groans]

16:50.744 --> 16:54.379
[moaning]

16:54.413 --> 16:55.447
Dad?

16:55.480 --> 16:57.149
[groaning]

16:57.183 --> 17:00.421
Harleen, honey. I'm sorry.

17:00.455 --> 17:03.389
There was a million dollar
bounty on ya.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.692
I didn't wanna have to
kill ya myself,

17:05.727 --> 17:09.429
so I tipped off an assassin
to collect a finder's fee.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.230
Big whoop!

17:10.262 --> 17:11.531
But ya couldn't do it!

17:11.531 --> 17:12.701
Could you,
you fucking piece of shit?

17:12.701 --> 17:14.634
You...

17:14.666 --> 17:15.970
Shit person!

17:16.001 --> 17:17.605
You were lying
to me the whole time!

17:17.640 --> 17:19.507
No, no, no, no, no.
I was not lying.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.509
I did owe the mob
a lotta money.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.577
I just figured
while I was waitin' on
the assassin to kill you,

17:24.612 --> 17:27.948
I could get ya
to take out the mob for me.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.651
What are ya doin?

17:29.682 --> 17:33.721
All I wanted was
what every Jewish mother wants,

17:33.752 --> 17:35.689
for you to marry a doctor.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.125
But I am a doctor!

17:38.159 --> 17:39.594
And now look at ya.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.497
I tried so hard
to get ya to change your life

17:42.528 --> 17:44.999
in the most
passive aggressive way possible

17:45.030 --> 17:47.134
and this is the thanks I get?

17:47.166 --> 17:48.867
Yellin' and fightin'?

17:48.903 --> 17:50.671
But I'm your daughter.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.204
I know.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.343
That's why people spit at us
at the grocery store.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.111
When you became "Harley Quinn,"

17:57.144 --> 17:59.614
we became the laughingstock
of the neighborhood.

17:59.645 --> 18:02.383
Oh, oh, I'm the reason
you're the laughingstock?

18:02.415 --> 18:04.983
What about Dad
bein' a fuckin' deadbeat?

18:05.019 --> 18:06.554
It's Bensonhurst!

18:06.586 --> 18:09.154
You beat an Irish and
people forget a lotta things.

18:09.190 --> 18:11.960
[exclaiming in pain]

18:11.991 --> 18:13.728
-[Harley grunts]
-[groans]

18:13.760 --> 18:18.432
[grunting] Piece of shit,
I'll fuckin' kill you.

18:18.432 --> 18:19.267
Ha!

18:19.267 --> 18:21.835
[grunting]

18:21.867 --> 18:23.871
[grunting]

18:23.903 --> 18:26.038
[Nick] Ahhh!

18:26.073 --> 18:28.740
I do not know why
you're so upset.

18:28.776 --> 18:30.242
I figured you'd understand.

18:30.278 --> 18:32.846
After all,
you're a criminal, like me.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.780
I'm nothin' like you.

18:34.815 --> 18:36.384
Ahhh!

18:36.415 --> 18:37.884
Oh, sure ya are!
Of course ya are!

18:37.919 --> 18:40.386
Ya turned on your crew
just like I turned on you.

18:40.421 --> 18:43.690
Classic case a' samesies.

18:43.722 --> 18:44.790
-[grunting]
-[groans]

18:44.790 --> 18:45.759
Ahhh!

18:45.759 --> 18:47.027
No samesies!

18:47.059 --> 18:48.961
I didn't turn on my crew.
They left me!

18:48.996 --> 18:50.695
Yeah, 'cause you
were suckin' face

18:50.695 --> 18:51.695
with that goyische clown.

18:51.699 --> 18:53.468
You've always had
bad taste in men.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.505
Gee, I wonder
where I learned that from?

18:55.538 --> 18:57.305
[screams]

18:57.336 --> 18:59.075
Oh, my gift wrapping station!

18:59.106 --> 19:03.576
[both grunting]

19:03.611 --> 19:06.413
Harleen,
please don't kill your father.

19:06.445 --> 19:08.048
Yeah, we're family.

19:08.082 --> 19:09.982
Family doesn't kill each other.

19:10.017 --> 19:11.884
-[grunts]
-[groans]

19:11.919 --> 19:14.820
You people are not my family.

19:14.855 --> 19:16.021
And ya know what?

19:16.056 --> 19:18.924
[grunts]

19:18.959 --> 19:22.709
You're not even worth it.

19:26.231 --> 19:27.583
[moaning]

19:31.439 --> 19:35.142
Harley? What happened to you?

19:35.174 --> 19:39.577
[groans] Uh...

19:39.613 --> 19:42.147
[gasps softly]

19:42.182 --> 19:44.518
<i>Well, look who's up.</i>

19:44.549 --> 19:45.884
Harleen?

19:45.919 --> 19:47.188
Wha...

19:47.188 --> 19:48.653
How much of this
am I hallucinating?

19:48.653 --> 19:49.557
<i>Just me.</i>

19:49.557 --> 19:51.192
<i>Weirdly the passed out guy</i>

19:51.192 --> 19:53.492
<i>with the boner and the plant</i>
driving the car are both real.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.827
Why did ya tell me
to go back to Bensonhurst?

19:55.863 --> 19:57.329
<i>In my defense,</i>

19:57.329 --> 19:59.034
<i>how could I have</i>
<i>possibly known your parents</i>

19:59.034 --> 20:01.669
<i>would try to kill you</i>
<i>for a million dollar bounty?</i>

20:01.669 --> 20:03.170
<i>Who wanted you dead,</i>
<i>by the way?</i>

20:03.170 --> 20:05.605
No idea.
Feels like it could be anyone.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.375
Now I got no one left.
And even Ivy hates me.

20:08.409 --> 20:09.875
What the fuck
you babblin' about?

20:09.910 --> 20:11.345
Ivy doesn't hate you.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.180
I'm only here
because Ivy says she needs you.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.214
She's been captured.
It's life or death.

20:15.249 --> 20:16.583
What?

20:16.584 --> 20:17.384
Step on it

20:17.384 --> 20:19.785
[brakes screech]

20:22.490 --> 20:25.424
That's when I told my mother
I don't want to be a lawyer.

20:25.460 --> 20:28.095
My passion is
early childhood education.

20:28.127 --> 20:30.396
And let me tell you,
she did not...

20:30.431 --> 20:31.699
Oop. Doctor's here.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.468
Sorry, I guess it's time
for harvesting.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.769
Who the fuck are you?
Show me your face.

20:35.804 --> 20:40.804
Uh... Gonna have to
settle for a bag.

20:43.411 --> 20:45.059
[straining]

20:50.115 --> 20:51.467
[exhales]

20:58.357 --> 20:59.759
Joshua!

20:59.791 --> 21:01.096
Whatup, Bane?

21:01.127 --> 21:03.395
I just saw the statement
from the Legion corporate card

21:03.431 --> 21:05.365
that your Uncle Penguin
gave you.

21:05.397 --> 21:07.867
Did you put a down payment

21:07.867 --> 21:10.769
on a bounty
to kill Harley Quinn?

21:10.804 --> 21:12.641
What? Pfft. No.

21:12.673 --> 21:15.375
You are a lying liar!

21:15.409 --> 21:18.179
[yells] Okay, yes!
She ruined my bar mitzvah.

21:18.211 --> 21:21.647
I want her dead.
Dead. Dead. Dead!

21:21.682 --> 21:24.986
The credit card
is for emergencies only,

21:25.019 --> 21:27.855
but your bill is all candies,
and vape pens,

21:27.887 --> 21:31.459
and something suspiciously
labeled "dolphin encounter."

21:31.490 --> 21:35.028
When you put out a hit,
you pay in cash.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.730
Okay, fine, I'll cancel it.

21:36.761 --> 21:37.865
Already done

21:37.897 --> 21:41.500
because I am this
credit card's reckoning.

21:41.500 --> 21:45.874
I am cutting this card
and I am cutting it in half--

21:45.905 --> 21:48.075
No. Please.
I hate when you do this, Bane.

21:48.106 --> 21:49.675
-These blades are dull.
-Bane!

21:49.711 --> 21:51.644
-I will bend it.
-Don't do that.

21:51.678 --> 21:52.913
Too late!

21:52.945 --> 21:55.147
Do you think I want to be
credit card paying man?

21:55.182 --> 21:57.151
I have dreams, too!

21:57.182 --> 21:58.987
Sorry, Bane. No, you're right.

21:59.019 --> 22:02.021
You're right. I shouldn't have
tried to kill Harley.

22:02.057 --> 22:05.625
Aw, I guess
I was just being...impulsive.

22:05.660 --> 22:07.428
Because you are young.

22:07.461 --> 22:12.365
The road to maturity
is a long one, Joshua.

22:12.400 --> 22:17.202
Ahhh! Goddammit!
Who put that there?

22:17.238 --> 22:19.105
[Bane yells]
Blow up on the ground

22:19.137 --> 22:23.308
you stupid office chair!

22:23.344 --> 22:25.577
[theme music playing]
