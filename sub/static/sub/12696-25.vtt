WEBVTT

00:07.933 --> 00:15.067
- *

00:15.167 --> 00:18.233
- All right, take a break,
prom committee.

00:18.333 --> 00:21.067
Not on Napoleon's ottoman!
- Sorry!

00:21.167 --> 00:22.767
- Guys, the prom
is in two days.

00:22.867 --> 00:25.267
All we have to do is not cause
a kabillion dollars in damage

00:25.367 --> 00:27.533
to the art in this
museum before then.

00:31.033 --> 00:33.800
- Wolfgang did it.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.567
- Mein bad--sehn.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.833
- Oh, there's, Allison.

00:40.933 --> 00:42.333
Uh, guys, start setting up.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.000
There's something I gotta
do before we rehearse.

00:44.100 --> 00:47.300
- Cherry, how are you getting
reception inside the museum?

00:47.400 --> 00:51.833
- I'm not. I'm laughing at
this wallpaper of my cat.

00:51.933 --> 00:55.267
- Cherry, that's not a cat.

00:55.367 --> 00:58.533
- Then whose tummy have
I been tickling?

00:58.633 --> 01:00.067
- Come on, there's
reception outside.

01:04.500 --> 01:09.933
- *

01:12.167 --> 01:22.567
- *

01:25.567 --> 01:28.400
- Pssst! Allison,
come here.

01:30.367 --> 01:32.167
- Check it out.

01:32.267 --> 01:34.600
- "Will you go to
prom with me?"

01:34.700 --> 01:38.667
You defaced
a priceless artifact?

01:38.767 --> 01:42.633
That is so romantic!
Yes, I'll go!

01:42.733 --> 01:45.533
Prom is in two days!
What took you so long?

01:45.633 --> 01:47.733
- Well, up until yesterday you
were boycotting prom.

01:47.833 --> 01:49.900
- Yeah, because thousands
of flowers die

01:50.067 --> 01:51.967
just to make those corsages.

01:52.067 --> 01:54.567
But then I found
the perfect dress.

01:54.667 --> 01:56.533
- It's gonna be
a great night--

01:56.633 --> 01:58.800
as long as I go cancel
the corsage.

02:05.667 --> 02:18.833
- *

02:23.200 --> 02:25.400
- The police will
take it from here.

02:26.967 --> 02:31.067
- Wait! I love you!
I mean...who are you?

02:31.167 --> 02:32.767
- I'm ThunderGirl.

02:32.867 --> 02:37.567
- *

02:42.500 --> 02:45.433
- Dude! Some superhero
named ThunderGirl

02:45.533 --> 02:48.067
just stopped that thief
and saved our lives.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.200
- She was like some sort
of super-goddess.

02:52.300 --> 02:55.233
- With telekinesis.

02:55.333 --> 02:57.767
- Ah, so that word you know.

02:59.467 --> 03:02.233
- Looks like we missed
something.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.900
- *

03:10.067 --> 03:12.167
- And so it looks like
there's a new mysterious

03:12.267 --> 03:14.067
superhero in our midst.

03:14.133 --> 03:18.200
The question that everyone's
asking: who is ThunderGirl?

03:18.300 --> 03:21.200
- ThunderGirl
needs to be stopped

03:21.300 --> 03:24.267
and I know just the man
for the job...

03:24.367 --> 03:33.567
her brother Max.

03:33.667 --> 03:35.867
- *

03:35.967 --> 03:37.100
* What you see

03:37.200 --> 03:38.567
* Is not what you get

03:38.667 --> 03:41.867
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

03:41.967 --> 03:43.433
* We fit right in

03:43.533 --> 03:44.900
* Bet you never guessed

03:45.067 --> 03:46.433
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

03:46.533 --> 03:48.200
* Just like all the rest

03:48.300 --> 03:50.067
* A picture
perfect family *

03:50.100 --> 03:52.067
* Is what we try to be

03:52.167 --> 03:53.267
* Look closer,
you might see *

03:53.367 --> 03:55.067
* The crazy things we do

03:55.167 --> 03:56.567
* This isn't
make believe *

03:56.667 --> 03:58.333
* It's our reality

03:58.433 --> 03:59.767
* Just your average family

03:59.867 --> 04:03.100
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

04:03.200 --> 04:06.867
* Livin' a double life *

04:11.167 --> 04:14.400
- Oh, ho, hey!
There's our ThunderGirl.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.300
- Oh, we saw it on the news.

04:16.400 --> 04:19.900
Max, can you believe your sister
thwarted a diamond robbery?

04:20.067 --> 04:22.133
- Oh, can you believe
I don't care?

04:24.067 --> 04:26.700
- Hey, I saved your
bandmates' lives.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.633
If it weren't for me, you'd be
Max and the crushed skulls.

04:29.733 --> 04:31.767
- Stupidest band name ever.

04:31.867 --> 04:34.067
Tell Oyster we have
a band name.

04:35.733 --> 04:39.467
- Now that you are
a real life super hero,

04:39.567 --> 04:42.367
I'm giving you--this!

04:42.467 --> 04:44.900
- Oh. Wow, dad!
This is so awesome.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.533
Thank you.

04:46.633 --> 04:48.367
What is it?

04:48.467 --> 04:50.767
- The original
thunder signal.

04:50.867 --> 04:53.767
The Hero League used it to shine
the Thunder 'T' in the sky

04:53.867 --> 04:55.467
when they needed
to summon me.

04:55.567 --> 04:56.967
- Thanks, dad.

04:57.067 --> 04:59.100
I'm sure this will come in handy
when I don't have my cellphone,

04:59.200 --> 05:01.267
or my tablet,
and it's also dark outside,

05:01.367 --> 05:04.667
and I happen to be looking
in the right direction.

05:04.767 --> 05:06.833
- It's symbolic!

05:08.333 --> 05:11.700
- Now that Phoebe's a famous
supe, can we fight crime, too?

05:11.800 --> 05:16.233
- Let's kick some
bad guy butt!

05:16.333 --> 05:17.800
No.

05:17.900 --> 05:21.133
Sorry, kids,
you're too young.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.300
- Guess we have to wait
'til our mid-30s

05:23.400 --> 05:25.967
like Max and Phoebe.

05:26.067 --> 05:28.433
- Unless we take
the hero aptitude test

05:28.533 --> 05:29.733
on the Hero League website,

05:29.833 --> 05:32.733
ace it and prove to them
that we have what it takes.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.100
- Good idea.
Is it a true/false test?

05:35.200 --> 05:36.467
I'm great at those.

05:36.567 --> 05:38.600
- I don't think so.
- True!

05:38.700 --> 05:39.700
- This isn't the test.
- False!

05:39.800 --> 05:40.833
- I'm going to zap you.
- False!

05:40.933 --> 05:42.533
- Ow!

05:42.633 --> 05:45.067
Okay, that one was true.

05:47.433 --> 05:50.233
- I wore this to tux to
Evil Prom with Octopus Girl.

05:50.333 --> 05:54.600
Nice person, a little handsy.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.467
- No time for jokes, Colosso.

05:56.567 --> 05:58.067
Phoebe's been crushing
it as a superhero

05:58.100 --> 05:59.667
and all I've been
doing for months

05:59.767 --> 06:01.567
is writing in
this chronicle,

06:01.667 --> 06:03.900
which we all know
is a diary, and for what?

06:04.067 --> 06:06.333
- Well, your penmanship
has improved

06:06.433 --> 06:09.800
and you talk more freely
about your feelings.

06:09.900 --> 06:12.067
- Even Dark Mayhem knows
I'm going nowhere.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.767
It's like he abandoned me.

06:13.867 --> 06:14.933
Why isn't he calling?

06:15.067 --> 06:16.833
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Dark Mayhem calling.

06:16.933 --> 06:19.100
- He's calling!

06:21.567 --> 06:22.700
- Hello, Dark Mayhem.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.700
- Max, how would you
like to finally become

06:25.800 --> 06:28.067
a full

06:28.133 --> 06:29.867
- I would.
- Yes, please.

06:29.967 --> 06:32.900
- Good. Meet me at Villain
Headquarters tomorrow.

06:33.067 --> 06:34.667
I'll send the co-ordinates.

06:34.767 --> 06:36.767
Uh, tomorrow?

06:36.867 --> 06:38.400
I'm kind of hanging
out with Allison.

06:38.500 --> 06:42.767
Maybe early next week?
- How about early next never!

06:42.867 --> 06:46.300
- Wait! Okay, okay!
I'll be there.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.767
- I can't believe I'm
gonna be a villain.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.867
Wait, do you have
a chronicle, too?

06:51.967 --> 06:53.933
- It's more of
a dream journal.

06:54.067 --> 06:56.233
And one of them
just came true.

06:59.133 --> 07:04.267
- *

07:04.367 --> 07:06.433
Oh, my gosh!
Here comes Xander.

07:06.533 --> 07:07.600
He's gonna ask me to prom.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.200
Oh, my gosh!

07:09.300 --> 07:10.367
- Hey, Cherry.

07:10.467 --> 07:11.667
Can I have my pen back?

07:11.767 --> 07:15.833
- I'd love to! Pick me
up tomorrow at 8:00.

07:15.933 --> 07:18.833
- Just take mine.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.433
I keep doing that.

07:22.533 --> 07:24.633
You're so lucky that you
don't have to find a date.

07:24.733 --> 07:26.567
- I know. Going with Link
just makes sense.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.667
Even though we're not
technically a couple anymore,

07:28.767 --> 07:29.933
I know we'll have fun.

07:31.733 --> 07:35.267
- Oh, well, there's
Mr. Dependable now.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.267
Hey, Link.

07:37.367 --> 07:38.500
Perfect.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.100
Sounds good.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.067
Got it.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.267
He's not coming.

07:43.367 --> 07:45.333
- He said he's too
busy in Hong Kong

07:45.433 --> 07:48.300
and the Hero League won't
let him take time off.

07:50.067 --> 07:53.667
- I'd love to! Pick me up
tomorrow at 8:00.

07:53.767 --> 07:57.733
- Wait a minute,
since none of us have dates,

07:57.833 --> 07:58.867
why don't we all
just go together?

07:58.967 --> 08:00.667
- Ooh, like a single
ladies dance?

08:00.767 --> 08:02.133
- Ooh! I'm in.
- Me, too.

08:02.233 --> 08:04.233
- Done.
Single ladies dance.

08:08.767 --> 08:11.100
- Phoebe, what is up
with your brother?

08:11.200 --> 08:12.833
First he asks me to prom
and then he disappears.

08:12.933 --> 08:14.300
I have so many questions.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.767
What's he wearing?
When's he picking me up?

08:15.867 --> 08:17.200
Do we eat before?
During

08:17.300 --> 08:20.333
When do we eat, Phoebe?
When do we eat?

08:21.533 --> 08:24.267
Sorry. I'm just suddenly
really, really into prom.

08:24.367 --> 08:26.433
- So, uh, I'll tell
him to call you?

08:26.533 --> 08:28.467
- My life depends on it.

08:30.667 --> 08:33.700
- Whoa! I'm a t-shirt...

08:33.800 --> 08:36.067
enthusiast.

08:36.133 --> 08:37.367
Where'd you guys get those?

08:37.467 --> 08:39.167
- We joined the
ThunderGirl Fan Club.

08:39.267 --> 08:40.833
- ThunderGirl has
a fan club?

08:40.933 --> 08:43.200
- She's only the most
awesome superhero ever.

08:43.300 --> 08:45.900
- Well, yeah,
I guess she is.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.533
But aren't her gloves blue?

08:47.633 --> 08:49.833
- Quiet! You don't know
anything about ThunderGirl!

08:49.933 --> 08:53.333
Who she is, what she
thinks...who she loves.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.567
- Welcome to
Happy Fun Burger.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.067
May I take your order?

09:04.167 --> 09:06.700
- MAN: I'll have a fillet of fun
with cheese, extra pickle.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.633
- One pickle per customer.

09:08.733 --> 09:10.067
- MAN: Well, what if
I want two?

09:10.100 --> 09:12.067
- Then I do this!

09:19.067 --> 09:20.367
- Boss.

09:20.467 --> 09:23.533
- Boy here.

09:23.633 --> 09:25.833
- Max, right on time.

09:25.933 --> 09:29.100
- Oh, Dark Mayhem,
it's such a honor, sir.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.167
- Follow me to
Mayhem Central Command.

09:31.267 --> 09:34.200
Son of Scalestro,
you're on the register.

09:34.300 --> 09:37.933
- Yes! So long fries.

09:44.600 --> 09:50.867
- Max, meet my associates,
Fairy Pinch-ess and Strongdor.

09:53.367 --> 09:56.267
- Uh, viva la evil.

09:56.367 --> 09:59.567
Dark Mayhem, since when is
Villain League Headquarters

09:59.667 --> 10:01.200
in a fast food restaurant?

10:01.300 --> 10:04.567
- Since your sister exposed
our last headquarters.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.433
- And stopped diamond heist.

10:06.533 --> 10:09.200
- Now, we can't pay
for our new hideout.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.267
I want to pinch
her so bad!

10:14.433 --> 10:16.400
- Max, are you ready
to help us

10:16.500 --> 10:18.800
and finally join
the Villain League?

10:18.900 --> 10:20.367
- Yes. I'll do anything.

10:20.467 --> 10:21.933
- Excellent.

10:22.033 --> 10:25.833
This is the world's
first power-sapping orb.

10:25.933 --> 10:30.500
I want you to take
ThunderGirl's powers.

10:32.300 --> 10:35.067
Can't I just light an ocean
on fire or something?

10:35.167 --> 10:39.433
- No! You must take her powers
so we can be great again--

10:39.533 --> 10:45.233
unless you prefer to
live in her shadow?

10:45.333 --> 10:48.000
- Hey, Boss. Lunch rush.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.900
- Tell me when
the deed is done.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.033
Hairnets, people!

11:01.533 --> 11:03.433
- And...done.

11:03.533 --> 11:05.867
That hero test was easy.

11:05.967 --> 11:07.133
What did you get for
the last one?

11:07.233 --> 11:09.067
Circle or triangle?

11:12.067 --> 11:13.500
I'll go get our scores.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.933
- Hope I did well.

11:15.067 --> 11:16.633
Being a superhero is all
I've ever wanted.

11:16.733 --> 11:18.433
- I'm sure you did great.

11:23.767 --> 11:29.333
Oh, no, he answered triangle
for every question?

11:31.600 --> 11:35.567
- You...did great.

11:35.667 --> 11:39.733
That makes me
a hero mastermind.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.700
How'd you do?

11:42.800 --> 11:45.600
A 22? Yeesh!

11:45.700 --> 11:47.967
- Let's just forget these
tests ever happened.

11:48.067 --> 11:51.067
- No way! I'm ready
to be a superhero.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.333
To the park!

11:56.067 --> 11:58.567
- He even put triangle
for his name.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.700
- Max! Your very
intense girlfriend

12:03.800 --> 12:05.967
wants you to call her.

12:06.067 --> 12:08.400
Max?

12:08.500 --> 12:09.567
Oops.

12:09.667 --> 12:11.767
Left his chronicle open.

12:11.867 --> 12:15.133
Oops! I'm reading it.

12:15.233 --> 12:17.100
"Meeting with
Dark Mayhem."

12:17.200 --> 12:19.567
Meeting with Dark Mayhem?

12:19.667 --> 12:21.433
Max, please tell me
you're not communicating

12:21.533 --> 12:23.367
with the world's most
powerful Supervillain.

12:23.467 --> 12:26.100
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Calling Dark Mayhem.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.333
- Max, you got home fast.

12:28.433 --> 12:33.100
Did you use the orb to
take your sister's powers?

12:33.200 --> 12:36.667
...not yet.

12:36.767 --> 12:38.300
- Well, hurry.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.433
I just blew up another
car in the drive-thru.

12:40.533 --> 12:43.533
People are starting
to ask questions.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.233
We'll see about that.

12:55.533 --> 12:58.333
Just go find Phoebe
and take her powers.

12:58.433 --> 13:00.733
- I don't think
I can, Colosso.

13:00.833 --> 13:02.200
I mean, she's annoying,

13:02.300 --> 13:04.233
but it's not like
we're mortal enemies.

13:04.333 --> 13:07.733
- Come on, Max.
Are you a villain or not?

13:10.367 --> 13:11.467
- Give me that back!

13:11.567 --> 13:12.933
- I know all about
your plan, Max.

13:13.067 --> 13:14.267
I'm not gonna let you
take my powers.

13:14.367 --> 13:15.600
- Gimme it back!
- Give it to me!

13:15.700 --> 13:17.167
- It's mine!
- I'm not letting it go!

13:17.267 --> 13:18.733
- Give me the orb!

13:28.067 --> 13:30.133
You took my powers.

13:30.233 --> 13:33.067
- I'm sorry, Max, I didn't
want this to happen.

13:33.133 --> 13:34.300
But you brought
it on yourself.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.167
- Okay, now, give me
that back.

13:44.600 --> 13:48.867
We weren't mortal
enemies before...

13:48.967 --> 13:51.100
but we are now.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.267
Not gonna
say anything?

14:00.367 --> 14:01.700
- I don't know
where to begin.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.400
We couldn't be more
disappointed in you.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.667
I mean, you're working
for Dark Mayhem?

14:06.767 --> 14:08.967
- He is one of the most
dangerous villains

14:09.067 --> 14:10.400
on the planet.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.533
Just ask my old sidekick.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.067
Oh, wait, you can't.

14:13.133 --> 14:15.500
Dark Mayhem shot
him into space.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.433
- And you were gonna
take your sister's powers

14:17.533 --> 14:18.733
and just hand
them over to him?

14:18.833 --> 14:20.600
- All right, I was only thinking
about taking her powers.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.433
She actually took mine.

14:22.533 --> 14:24.467
Now she's gonna pay.
- Oh, no, no, no.

14:24.567 --> 14:27.733
The only person who's gonna
pay for this is you, Max.

14:27.833 --> 14:29.900
- Not only don't you
have your powers,

14:30.067 --> 14:31.367
we're taking away Colosso.

14:31.467 --> 14:32.867
- Yeah.

14:32.967 --> 14:34.833
He's staying in our room
until coyote season.

14:34.933 --> 14:38.133
- So, obviously, no prom,
no girlfriend,

14:38.233 --> 14:39.633
no leaving the house.

14:39.733 --> 14:41.733
- Oh, and about
your lair...

14:43.767 --> 14:48.667
- *

14:48.767 --> 14:52.067
- No-o-o-o!

14:57.067 --> 14:59.700
- All right, girls, before
we leave, prom checklist.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.433
Should I wear my hair
up or down?

15:01.533 --> 15:03.100
- ALL: Down.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.467
- Beaded clutch
or satin handbag?

15:04.567 --> 15:06.300
- ALL:
Beaded clutch.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.333
- Minivan it is.

15:11.433 --> 15:14.333
There's no limo.
I just felt left out.

15:14.433 --> 15:16.067
- Here's your change.

15:16.133 --> 15:17.533
I gave myself a giant tip

15:17.633 --> 15:20.833
because my service
was excellent.

15:20.933 --> 15:22.067
- PHOEBE: Wait.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.433
Mrs. Wong, you're in the
ThunderGirl Fan Club?

15:24.533 --> 15:25.767
- Of course.

15:25.867 --> 15:28.100
ThunderGirl is great
and awesome...

15:28.200 --> 15:29.967
like you, but...
the opposite.

15:33.467 --> 15:35.267
- Oh, um, I'll text
you guys later.

15:35.367 --> 15:36.300
I forgot my bag.
- Okay.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.333
- Bye.

15:38.433 --> 15:40.133
Oh...thanks, Link.

15:40.233 --> 15:42.267
Link?

15:42.367 --> 15:44.233
What are you doing here?

15:44.333 --> 15:45.867
- I'm here to take
you to prom.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.067
That's funny 'cause before
you said you couldn't...

15:50.133 --> 15:52.500
and now you're here.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.233
- I know. But I felt bad
for bailing on you.

15:54.333 --> 15:56.733
So I told the Hero League,
I don't care if you fire me,

15:56.833 --> 16:00.633
I'm gonna spend this one special
night with a very special girl.

16:00.733 --> 16:02.133
So, what do you say?

16:02.233 --> 16:03.767
Will you be my date?

16:03.867 --> 16:05.067
- Oh.

16:05.100 --> 16:08.233
Well, um...how could
I say no to that?

16:08.333 --> 16:10.833
Seriously, how?

16:10.933 --> 16:13.467
- Uh...oh!

16:16.267 --> 16:19.567
Phoebe is ThunderGirl?

16:19.667 --> 16:23.100
If I expose her,
I'll be famous.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.600
It's time to
go paparazzi!

16:29.100 --> 16:30.467
- Being a hero mastermind,

16:30.567 --> 16:33.667
I'm able to spot crimes
that no one else can.

16:39.700 --> 16:43.500
Check it out, that man is trying
to steal that woman's ring.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.767
- Billy, he's not
stealing anything.

16:45.867 --> 16:48.067
But he is!

16:48.100 --> 16:50.100
- Give her back that ring!

16:50.200 --> 16:52.633
- MAN:

16:52.733 --> 16:55.967
- CROWD:

16:57.967 --> 16:59.833
- You stopped that
purse snatcher.

17:00.067 --> 17:02.333
- But what about the guy
trying to steal the ring?

17:02.433 --> 17:05.733
- You, um...made them
fall in love?

17:05.833 --> 17:08.200
Look.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.900
- Wow.

17:10.067 --> 17:12.667
I am good!

17:12.767 --> 17:14.367
Criminals of Hiddenville...

17:14.467 --> 17:16.300
fear me!

17:16.400 --> 17:18.133
- I know I do.

17:28.433 --> 17:31.167
- MRS. WONG:
Aha!

17:31.267 --> 17:33.467
Just the proof I need.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.400
- Ugh!

17:47.067 --> 17:51.733
I've gotta find
a way to get out of here.

17:51.833 --> 17:52.800
Wait.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.400
My secret stash of TNT.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.567
I'll blast my way out.

18:00.367 --> 18:03.933
- I love you beary much.

18:04.067 --> 18:06.800
I'm never
getting out of here.

18:11.900 --> 18:14.433
- COLOSSO:

18:16.167 --> 18:17.467
Colosso?

18:17.567 --> 18:18.933
You escaped.

18:19.067 --> 18:21.067
- And I brought
you a present.

18:24.067 --> 18:25.633
- I'll pass.

18:25.733 --> 18:28.500
- COLOSSO: Look.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.933
- The orb! Wow!

18:31.067 --> 18:33.067
- I live in your
dad's bedroom now.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.967
I saw him enter
his safe combination.

18:35.067 --> 18:37.900
In fact, I saw
a lot of things.

18:38.067 --> 18:40.267
Ugh! Yuck!

18:40.367 --> 18:43.300
- I can use it to get revenge
on Phoebe and take her powers.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.300
- Right after you use it to
get your own powers back.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.067
- I can't.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.767
I need some kind of computer
chip to override the system.

18:50.867 --> 18:52.200
And where am I gonna
find that?

18:52.300 --> 18:53.367
Look around!

18:53.467 --> 18:56.667
- I love you beary much.

18:56.767 --> 19:01.133
- And I love the computer chip
inside you beary much.

19:04.967 --> 19:06.667
- Phoebe!
- I don't have a prom date!

19:06.767 --> 19:08.233
Single ladies dance.

19:08.333 --> 19:11.067
- Okay, stop dancing
and tell me where Max is.

19:11.100 --> 19:12.667
Prom is tonight
and I haven't been able to

19:12.767 --> 19:14.400
reach him in two days.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.667
- Yeah, sorry, Allison,

19:15.767 --> 19:17.567
but I don't think Max
is gonna go to prom.

19:19.167 --> 19:20.967
- There's just a lot of drama
going on at home right now.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.833
But maybe you can
find another date.

19:22.933 --> 19:24.333
Although, it might be kind of
hard at the last minute.

19:24.433 --> 19:27.200
- Hey! One of you is taking
me to Junior Prom!

19:27.300 --> 19:30.333
Whoever's interested,
meet me in the quad.

19:34.700 --> 19:37.067
- Oh, come on, ladies,
it'll be fun.

19:37.100 --> 19:39.600
We know you don't
have dates.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.367
- Look, you guys are cute,

19:41.467 --> 19:44.067
and each one of us has
a crush on each one of you.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.233
It couldn't be more perfect.

19:46.333 --> 19:49.433
- But, tonight we're all
about us single ladies.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.600
- Guys, guys,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:53.700 --> 19:55.067
They're asking you to prom.

19:55.100 --> 19:57.067
I'm okay with you
saying yes.

19:57.100 --> 19:57.967
In fact, I--

19:58.067 --> 19:59.800
- Phoebe,
we made a prom pact

19:59.900 --> 20:01.433
and what kind of friends
would be if we broke it?

20:01.533 --> 20:02.933
- CHERRY:
Yeah.

20:03.033 --> 20:06.900
We'd be cold-hearted, good for
nothing, scheming backstabbers.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.433
- Good thing none of us are
any of those things.

20:10.533 --> 20:12.833
Oh, there's the bell.

20:12.933 --> 20:14.733
Ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling.

20:17.533 --> 20:19.200
- Well, now we're
really late.

20:21.667 --> 20:25.267
- Wait! Which one of you
is giddy for Gideon?

20:27.800 --> 20:29.067
- And that, Nora,

20:29.167 --> 20:31.367
is how you keep witches
from poisoning birds.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.733
- Here are your breadcrumbs,
Mrs. Fitzrellio.

20:40.100 --> 20:42.833
- There you two are.
I was just making lunch.

20:42.933 --> 20:46.733
- Veggie burgers, because
they're so delicious.

20:46.833 --> 20:48.567
- I'll take mine to go.

20:48.667 --> 20:49.767
- Max!

20:49.867 --> 20:51.133
- How'd you get out
of your room?

20:51.233 --> 20:52.567
- Easy.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.733
I just made a few tweaks on this
thing and got my powers back.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.333
- The orb. Put that down.
It's dangerous.

20:56.433 --> 20:59.600
- Only when it's in
the wrong hands, dad...

20:59.700 --> 21:02.400
like mine.

21:04.467 --> 21:07.700
- I love you beary much.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.067
- Pretend you didn't
hear that.

21:10.133 --> 21:13.833
- Hank, our powers are gone.

21:13.933 --> 21:18.833
- Hey, I can't laser!
- And I'm not fast.

21:22.833 --> 21:25.833
- You know I'd love to stay and
watch you be weak and helpless,

21:25.933 --> 21:28.633
but...I've got
a sister to destroy.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.400
- Not you. Phoebe.

21:34.500 --> 21:37.267
Now, to make sure none
of you can follow me...

21:47.133 --> 21:50.267
- Max, if you go
down this path,

21:50.367 --> 21:52.200
you are no longer our son.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.533
- Exactly.

21:54.633 --> 21:57.467
I'm a supervillain now.

22:01.433 --> 22:14.400
- *

22:20.967 --> 22:23.167
I gave him his
assignment yesterday.

22:23.267 --> 22:26.800
I'd do the job myself if I knew
where ThunderGirl lived.

22:26.900 --> 22:30.867
Check out the news.

22:33.167 --> 22:35.200
- If you're just joining
us, local woman,

22:35.300 --> 22:36.433
Olympia Wong has proof

22:36.533 --> 22:39.400
that ThunderGirl lives
right here in Hiddenville.

22:39.500 --> 22:43.433
- It's true. ThunderGirl
is Phoebe Thunderman.

22:43.533 --> 22:45.733
The whole family are
superheroes.

22:45.833 --> 22:48.733
They live 828 Oak Dale Lane.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.933
Call me, Jimmy Fallon!

22:51.067 --> 22:52.100
- There you have it, folks,

22:52.200 --> 22:55.200
a superhero, right in
our own hometown.

22:59.367 --> 23:01.533
Gas up the Mayhem 'Copter,

23:01.633 --> 23:03.833
we're going to Hiddenville.

23:11.067 --> 23:12.933
- Welcome to prom, everyone!

23:13.067 --> 23:16.433
We are Max
and the Crushed Skulls.

23:16.533 --> 23:18.900
- CROWD:

23:19.067 --> 23:21.267
- Except Max isn't
here to play.

23:21.367 --> 23:28.100
- *

23:28.200 --> 23:30.533
- Single ladies prom selfie.

23:38.567 --> 23:40.267
Let's go dance.

23:40.367 --> 23:42.233
- I thought you said
you wanted punch?

23:42.333 --> 23:43.633
- Yeah, I did.

23:43.733 --> 23:48.067
I wanna punch the dance floor,
in the mouth, with my feet.

23:50.433 --> 23:52.800
Oh, you know what, uh,
you guys go start without me.

23:52.900 --> 23:56.067
I gotta...stretch
out my hammies.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.533
Hi, Link.
- Oh, there you are.

24:02.633 --> 24:06.367
This is for you.
- Oh, what a beautiful corsage.

24:09.067 --> 24:11.800
That is so predictable.

24:11.900 --> 24:14.867
Hey, how about we get
our picture taken.

24:14.967 --> 24:16.267
- Okay.

24:16.367 --> 24:18.500
- Uh, you go get us
a spot in line.

24:18.600 --> 24:19.867
I'm gonna powder
my hammies.

24:19.967 --> 24:22.700
No looking back at my
shiny...hammies.

24:22.800 --> 24:23.900
- I don't think you know
what hammies are.

24:24.067 --> 24:26.300
- I said no looking back.

24:29.700 --> 24:33.267
Single ladies...oh, ooh!
- ALL: Whoo!

24:33.367 --> 24:35.467
- Hey, Phoebs, where'd
you get that corsage?

24:35.567 --> 24:39.367
- Oh! I...um...

24:39.467 --> 24:41.867
Conga line!

24:45.633 --> 24:55.633
*

24:55.733 --> 24:58.100
- NORA: We're frozen in.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.067
I can't get
a cellphone signal.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.567
- Hank, we have to warn Phoebe.
She's in danger.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.133
- Right, stand
back everyone.

25:04.233 --> 25:05.167
I may not have my powers,

25:05.267 --> 25:07.067
but I still have
my athletic prowess

25:07.167 --> 25:08.800
and amazing physique!

25:16.200 --> 25:18.900
- I'm neither athletic
nor amazing.

25:20.733 --> 25:25.167
- Or we could use the Thunder
Signal to melt our way out.

25:25.267 --> 25:27.133
- I wish you would
have thought of that

25:27.233 --> 25:29.667
before you made me look like
a fool in front of the children.

25:33.067 --> 25:34.267
- All right, this is
gonna take a while.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.133
Let's get every light
in the house.

25:39.267 --> 25:40.333
- Mom and dad are thinking,

25:40.433 --> 25:42.767
but they're not thinking
like a mastermind.

25:42.867 --> 25:46.500
Three words:
couch, fire...Nora.

25:49.067 --> 25:50.567
- Billy, stop!

25:50.667 --> 25:51.767
You're not
a hero mastermind.

25:51.867 --> 25:54.567
- False. But I'd
also accept triangle.

25:54.667 --> 25:57.067
- I'm serious.

25:57.167 --> 25:59.133
I know how much that
test meant to you,

25:59.233 --> 26:00.600
so I switched the results

26:00.700 --> 26:02.833
so you would think
my high score was yours.

26:02.933 --> 26:04.267
I'm sorry.

26:07.933 --> 26:10.267
That means I'll never
be a superhero.

26:10.367 --> 26:14.567
- Thanks to Max, I don't
think any of us will be.

26:20.967 --> 26:23.700
- Ah...there it is.

26:23.800 --> 26:27.067
I didn't realize I had so much
stuff from my stomach stash.

26:30.100 --> 26:33.500
- Max! Oh, it's you.

26:33.600 --> 26:34.667
Where is Max?

26:34.767 --> 26:36.167
Why hasn't he called?

26:36.267 --> 26:37.833
- Not to worry, DM.

26:37.933 --> 26:39.367
Max just took
his parents' powers

26:39.467 --> 26:41.333
and is on his way to steal
Phoebe's as we speak.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.133
- That means ThunderMan
and Electress

26:44.233 --> 26:47.567
will be sitting ducks
by the time I arrive.

26:47.667 --> 26:49.067
- Totally.

26:49.167 --> 26:50.867
Wait! You're coming here?

26:50.967 --> 26:52.200
- Yes.

26:52.300 --> 26:54.233
Your address is
all over the news.

26:54.333 --> 26:57.333
Once Max and I crush
the Thundermans,

26:57.433 --> 27:01.400
we'll make all of Hiddenville
our evil headquarters.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.867
- I love it.

27:02.967 --> 27:04.633
Now let's talk about me.

27:04.733 --> 27:08.200
I'm gonna need a masseuse, a
personal assistant, a tiny car.

27:08.300 --> 27:11.367
- Oops! Going through
a tunnel. Gotta go.

27:11.467 --> 27:15.500
That stupid rabbit will be
the first one I dispose of.

27:18.133 --> 27:22.067
Oh
- Yep.

27:22.133 --> 27:23.700
- Um, going through
another tunnel.

27:23.800 --> 27:26.067
Bye!

27:26.167 --> 27:27.700
- Oh...

27:31.333 --> 27:37.600
- *

27:37.700 --> 27:41.067
- Time to say goodbye to your
thunder, ThunderGirl.

27:41.133 --> 27:43.433
- Well, look who decided
to show up.

27:43.533 --> 27:44.667
- Allison.

27:44.767 --> 27:47.467
Uh...you look great.

27:47.567 --> 27:50.200
Who's this guy?
- This is Richard.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.300
- My name's Aaron.
- Shush.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.067
He's my date since
you ditched me.

27:54.167 --> 27:56.100
- I didn't ditch you.
Something came up.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.333
It's complicated.

27:58.433 --> 28:00.967
So complicated that you ditched
your girlfriend on prom night,

28:01.067 --> 28:03.100
show up in rags
and won't tell me why.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.833
Okay, let's make things less
complicated for you.

28:05.933 --> 28:07.233
We're done.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.767
Come on, Tim.

28:09.867 --> 28:11.767
- Wait, Allison.

28:15.233 --> 28:17.600
- Best prom ever.
Am I right, ladies!

28:17.700 --> 28:19.367
- ALL: Woo!

28:21.167 --> 28:22.900
- Uh, I love this part.

28:23.067 --> 28:24.867
Let's get closer.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.233
Link! I, um, forgot you were
holding our spot for pictures.

28:38.333 --> 28:40.300
- Well, I was,
but the line was moving

28:40.400 --> 28:43.833
and I ended up taking a picture
with your geometry teacher.

28:43.933 --> 28:44.833
Are you all right?

28:44.933 --> 28:46.100
Phoebe, you're acting
kinda weird.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.400
Me?

28:47.500 --> 28:49.200
- Yeah, next you're
gonna do that thing

28:49.300 --> 28:51.267
where you laugh on
every word you say.

28:51.367 --> 28:56.133
I...don't...do...that.

28:56.233 --> 28:58.867
- Phoebe!

28:58.967 --> 29:01.167
What is Link doing here?

29:01.267 --> 29:06.367
- Uh...Oh, my gosh,
Link, you're here!

29:08.433 --> 29:09.933
- Oh, it's great.
I...I got a poodle.

29:10.067 --> 29:11.433
I taught that puppy
how to sit.

29:11.533 --> 29:14.600
- Oh, that's so cute.

29:14.700 --> 29:19.900
Backstabber! How could
you break our prom pact?

29:20.067 --> 29:23.233
Come on, ladies.
Angry dance away.

29:24.133 --> 29:26.200
- Guys, wait.
I can explain.

29:28.933 --> 29:32.400
Shut up! No way!

29:35.567 --> 29:37.333
- So, when Link showed
up from Hong Kong,

29:37.433 --> 29:39.267
I just couldn't bring
myself to tell him.

29:39.367 --> 29:40.700
I'm so sorry,
but I promise I'll never

29:40.800 --> 29:43.167
keep anything from
you guys ever again.

29:43.267 --> 29:45.067
- Hey, everyone!

29:45.167 --> 29:48.700
Phoebe Thunderman
is ThunderGirl!

29:50.933 --> 29:53.967
- Starting now.

29:56.267 --> 29:58.200
- And this is the home
of ThunderGirl,

29:58.300 --> 30:00.667
where she lives with
her weird family.

30:00.767 --> 30:03.700
- And what kind of
powers do they have?

30:03.800 --> 30:06.233
- Superpowers, goofball.

30:06.333 --> 30:08.667
- [helicopter
blades whirring]

30:10.800 --> 30:12.400
- Big city news chopper!

30:12.500 --> 30:16.000
Make room, local hicks.

30:16.100 --> 30:18.700
- DARK MAYHEM:
Get out of my way!

30:20.267 --> 30:22.167
Channel Six Dumbface News?

30:25.667 --> 30:29.233
- Aah! Save me,
Jimmy Fallon!

30:29.333 --> 30:31.133
- ALL:

30:31.233 --> 30:33.233
- REPORTER:

30:38.333 --> 30:40.367
- BARB:
What is that?

30:40.467 --> 30:42.300
- DARK MAYHEM:
Dark Mayhem.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.000
And I'm here to destroy you.

30:45.100 --> 30:47.667
- STRONGDOR:
Strongdor here, too!

30:50.633 --> 30:55.033
- Take the kids upstairs.
I got this.

30:55.133 --> 30:56.967
- We got this.

30:58.333 --> 31:00.167
- Fire in the hole!

31:03.400 --> 31:05.267
- Go, go, go!

31:05.367 --> 31:06.933
Thank you, Colosso.

31:07.067 --> 31:09.733
- Hey, the only way to
save my furry little butt

31:09.833 --> 31:11.233
is by saving your
furry big butt.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.367
Get a longer robe!

31:13.467 --> 31:15.700
- Nobody is asking
you to look.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.400
- Hank, we have
to warn Phoebe.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.067
Quick, to the Thundervan.

31:20.167 --> 31:26.933
- *

31:27.067 --> 31:30.333
- Let the mayhem begin!

31:35.933 --> 31:40.267
I practiced that line in
the helicopter for nothing!

31:40.367 --> 31:43.433
- They escaped!

31:43.533 --> 31:46.900
How are we gonna find them
before they warn ThunderGirl?

31:47.067 --> 31:49.667
- I already did.

31:49.767 --> 31:53.800
Looks like we villains will
finally get to go to prom.

31:53.900 --> 31:55.300
- Strongdor went to prom.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.367
- Yeah, I went.

31:56.467 --> 31:59.700
- I leased a limo.

31:59.800 --> 32:02.800
- Yeah, me, too.
I went with Debbie.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.800
You don't know her.

32:10.667 --> 32:14.400
- Listen, guys, there are a lot
of crazy rumors on the internet.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.167
Okay, I'm not ThunderGirl.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.733
And I certainly don't
have superpowers.

32:18.833 --> 32:21.100
- Say goodbye to your
superpowers, ThunderGirl.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.167
- CROWD:

32:24.067 --> 32:25.300
- Oh, hey, Link.
How's Hong Kong?

32:25.400 --> 32:26.800
- Oh, it's great.
I got a poodle--

32:26.900 --> 32:28.900
- No one cares!

32:31.467 --> 32:33.200
Ooh! Phoebe!

32:33.300 --> 32:34.867
- You're not gonna
win this battle, Max.

32:34.967 --> 32:37.500
- This isn't a battle,
Phoebe, this is a war.

32:37.600 --> 32:41.733
- *

32:45.300 --> 32:46.933
- *

32:47.067 --> 32:50.267
- All this time Phoebe
was ThunderGirl?

32:50.367 --> 32:52.800
- I knew like a year ago.

32:55.100 --> 32:58.967
- Dudes, we were in the presence
of ThunderGirl the entire time.

32:59.067 --> 33:01.600
- Wolfgang!

33:03.500 --> 33:05.133
- Superpowers
and he's in a band.

33:05.233 --> 33:08.300
Man, my life sucks.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.467
- Give it up, Max.

33:09.567 --> 33:10.700
You're not gonna break
my concentration.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.100
- Nothing's gonna break mine.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.633
- HANK: Kids!

33:15.833 --> 33:18.867
- My orb!
- Oh, no, you don't.

33:18.967 --> 33:21.133
- Soggy but still evil.

33:24.167 --> 33:27.300
Looks like Hiddenville is about
to lose its new superhero.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.300
- BARB:
Max, stop!

33:29.400 --> 33:30.800
Give us back our powers.

33:30.900 --> 33:32.867
Dark Mayhem is on his way
to destroy us all.

33:32.967 --> 33:36.567
- I'm already here.

33:36.667 --> 33:39.333
- Strongdor here, too!

33:47.433 --> 33:49.767
- CROWD:

33:49.867 --> 33:53.433
- We meet at last,
ThunderGirl.

33:53.533 --> 33:54.967
Go ahead, Max.

33:55.067 --> 34:00.100
Take your sister's powers and
you'll finally be one of us.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.500
- Max, please!

34:01.600 --> 34:03.233
Look, I know you hate me,

34:03.333 --> 34:05.267
but you can't let Dark Mayhem
destroy Hiddenville.

34:05.367 --> 34:09.600
- Oh, ThunderGirl, I'm not going
to destroy Hiddenville.

34:09.700 --> 34:15.967
I'm going to enslave everyone in
it, to build my new evil empire.

34:16.067 --> 34:17.867
- Is that really
what you want, Max,

34:17.967 --> 34:19.467
to lose everything--

34:19.567 --> 34:24.167
your friends, Allison,
your family?

34:26.267 --> 34:28.167
- DARK MAYHEM: What are
you waiting for, Max?

34:28.267 --> 34:30.967
You are this close
to having it all.

34:33.833 --> 34:36.100
- I already have it all.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.100
- DARK MAYHEM: What are
you doing, Max?

34:39.200 --> 34:41.467
- Restoring my
family's powers.

34:46.200 --> 34:47.433
- You fool!

34:47.533 --> 34:49.200
- Yes! We're back!

34:49.300 --> 34:52.700
Oh, Barb, I think
I have your powers.

34:56.733 --> 34:59.433
- Super speed.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.900
Did I just teleport?

35:03.067 --> 35:06.600
- ThunderBaby away!

35:08.433 --> 35:10.867
- Billy, that means
you have laser eyes.

35:10.967 --> 35:12.900
- It doesn't matter.
I'm not a superhero.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.433
Here, take 'em back.

35:14.533 --> 35:16.700
- Ow! It doesn't
work that way.

35:18.100 --> 35:19.500
- The punch must have
short-circuited the orb.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.200
- They're confused from
having the wrong powers.

35:22.300 --> 35:23.133
Get them!

35:23.233 --> 35:24.833
- HANK:
Thundermans, attack!

35:29.067 --> 35:31.533
You picked
the wrong side, Max.

35:33.200 --> 35:39.433
- *

35:39.533 --> 35:41.133
- PHOEBE:

35:41.233 --> 35:43.467
Threatening my family
is one thing,

35:43.567 --> 35:45.200
but ruining my prom dress

35:45.300 --> 35:47.400
before I take pictures
is crossing the line!

35:49.200 --> 35:51.900
- *

35:52.067 --> 35:54.200
- DARK MAYHEM:

35:54.300 --> 35:57.933
- *

35:58.067 --> 36:01.333
- Ha, ha, ha! You missed.

36:01.433 --> 36:05.333
- *

36:05.433 --> 36:06.833
- Oow!

36:06.933 --> 36:09.867
- Sorry. I'm not used to
my wife's superpowers.

36:11.967 --> 36:13.400
Hi-ya!

36:13.500 --> 36:15.967
Ow!

36:16.067 --> 36:19.967
- Strongdor's turn.

36:22.633 --> 36:26.700
- *

36:26.800 --> 36:29.500
- Billy, help me!
- No Billy here.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.733
Just a boy who's
not a superhero.

36:32.833 --> 36:36.233
- *

36:36.333 --> 36:37.800
- We can't keep
this up forever.

36:37.900 --> 36:39.600
You open the orb,
I'll hold him off.

36:39.700 --> 36:43.933
- *

36:44.067 --> 36:45.733
- Phoebe, I just
want you to know

36:45.833 --> 36:48.067
the single ladies are
totally behind you.

36:48.133 --> 36:50.233
- Oh, thanks, girls.
It really means a lot.

36:52.333 --> 36:55.867
- No, we're seriously
right behind you.

36:55.967 --> 36:59.067
Do you think you could
move the fight that way?

36:59.133 --> 37:05.067
- *

37:05.133 --> 37:08.133
- So, since this
might be the end,

37:08.233 --> 37:09.900
who had a crush on who?

37:10.067 --> 37:11.900
- Oyster, I hardly think
that this is the time to--

37:12.067 --> 37:13.900
- I like Wolfgang.
- I like Gideon.

37:14.067 --> 37:15.800
- Sweetious.

37:15.900 --> 37:24.700
- *

37:24.800 --> 37:26.900
- Too slow.

37:27.067 --> 37:29.433
You couldn't hit me,
if you tried.

37:29.533 --> 37:30.667
- Then I'll stop trying.

37:34.367 --> 37:36.433
- Thanks for the tip.

37:38.433 --> 37:40.533
- I can't control where
these things come out.

37:43.067 --> 37:44.667
So weird.

37:44.767 --> 37:49.067
- *

37:49.100 --> 37:51.533
- Strongdor will crush you.

37:51.633 --> 37:54.167
- Strongdor will have
to catch me first.

37:58.300 --> 38:01.933
- Ooh!

38:02.067 --> 38:03.767
- Thank you for the dance.

38:03.867 --> 38:05.867
- Great job, honey.

38:05.967 --> 38:07.700
Uh-oh. I got this.

38:09.167 --> 38:10.967
Barb! A little help.

38:15.067 --> 38:17.067
- Got you.

38:17.133 --> 38:19.167
You can't teleport away
from my pinchy grip.

38:19.267 --> 38:21.067
Goodbye ThunderTween.

38:21.133 --> 38:22.833
- Let her go.

38:22.933 --> 38:25.067
- Oh, look who came
out of hiding.

38:26.567 --> 38:27.867
You're no superhero.

38:27.967 --> 38:29.967
You're just a scared
little boy.

38:31.967 --> 38:34.067
- Billy, what's the answer
to everything?

38:36.200 --> 38:38.267
Triangle!

38:41.733 --> 38:43.800
- No!

38:47.867 --> 38:49.333
- Billy, you saved me.

38:49.433 --> 38:51.400
Who cares if you're
not a mastermind.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.733
You're the bravest
superhero I know.

38:53.833 --> 38:55.667
- Thanks.

38:55.767 --> 38:58.133
- Let's get some of
these people to safety.

38:58.233 --> 39:00.233
Hey, come with us.
We'll get you out of here.

39:00.333 --> 39:03.167
- BILLY: Go, go, go!
Go, guys, go.

39:03.267 --> 39:04.967
- Orb, orb...
gotta find the orb.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.567
I'm sorry for being
a jerk earlier.

39:13.667 --> 39:15.067
I still really like you,

39:15.167 --> 39:16.933
but I get if dating
a superhero is too weird and--

39:18.567 --> 39:22.400
Sorry. That was the easiest
way to shut you up.

39:22.500 --> 39:23.600
- Yes!

39:23.700 --> 39:25.600
- Wow. Glad you liked it.

39:25.700 --> 39:29.233
- No, I mean...yes, but...
I found the orb.

39:29.333 --> 39:30.900
Now where were we?

39:32.633 --> 39:40.133
- *

39:40.233 --> 39:42.400
- Max!
- Gotta save the world.

39:44.933 --> 39:46.067
- Got him! Now, Max!

39:46.167 --> 39:47.300
- I don't think so!

39:55.067 --> 39:59.567
- *

40:02.433 --> 40:07.833
Max, couldn't take your
powers...but I will.

40:07.933 --> 40:10.967
- Oh!

40:11.067 --> 40:13.333
Mommy says I'm a good boy.

40:15.967 --> 40:20.167
- CROWD:

40:20.267 --> 40:22.967
- Chloe, you used dad's super
strength to save us?

40:23.067 --> 40:24.500
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

40:24.600 --> 40:29.067
ThunderBaby, away!

40:35.333 --> 40:38.233
- I love you beary much.

40:38.333 --> 40:39.733
- I love you, too,

40:39.833 --> 40:41.933
power-sapping orb that
I'm gonna keep forever.

40:42.033 --> 40:45.300
- I'll hold that for
safekeeping.

40:45.400 --> 40:50.300
- Listen, Phoebe,
I'm sorry for...for...

40:50.400 --> 40:51.600
- ...everything
you've ever done

40:51.700 --> 40:53.667
in your entire life
up to this point?

40:53.767 --> 40:55.600
- That.

40:55.700 --> 41:00.467
- I can't believe my baby
is finally a superhero.

41:00.567 --> 41:02.867
It's too bad we have to put
you in Super Villain prison

41:02.967 --> 41:04.600
for helping out Dark Mayhem.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.067
- HANK & BARB:

41:08.167 --> 41:09.933
- Kidding! But you should
have seen your face!

41:10.067 --> 41:11.933
You're like...oh!
- Come on, Barb.

41:12.067 --> 41:13.067
Let's go call
the Hero League.

41:13.167 --> 41:16.233
Take credit for all of this.

41:16.333 --> 41:19.833
- Hey, Thunderman,
since you have superpowers,

41:19.933 --> 41:23.233
there's a few things you need
to do if you wanna graduate.

41:23.333 --> 41:25.600
Number one, teach me to fly.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.467
Number two--

41:29.767 --> 41:33.233
- It feels so good
to finally do that.

41:33.333 --> 41:34.800
- Hmm...
Seeing Bradford frozen

41:34.900 --> 41:37.633
makes me feel like I'm
forgetting something.

41:37.733 --> 41:39.067
Link!

41:39.167 --> 41:40.300
- No, it doesn't
actually hurt at all.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.933
Maybe like a little
bit of freezer burn, but--

41:43.067 --> 41:46.467
- I taught that little
puppy how to sit.

41:46.567 --> 41:48.567
Wait, Phoebe,
what's going on?

41:48.667 --> 41:49.767
- Don't worry...

41:49.867 --> 41:51.833
it's picture time.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.500
- And, so, it is
with great pleasure

42:01.600 --> 42:06.700
that I proclaim Max Thunderman
an official superhero.

42:06.800 --> 42:08.067
- ALL:

42:10.400 --> 42:12.667
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna cry.

42:14.067 --> 42:15.867
- Dad...that's my cape.

42:18.367 --> 42:19.667
- Thank you, everyone.

42:19.767 --> 42:22.800
I promise to be worthy of this
cape and make you all proud.

42:22.900 --> 42:26.300
Hey, Sparkles, where are
you going with my stuff?

42:26.400 --> 42:27.733
- Well, since you're
not a villain anymore,

42:27.833 --> 42:29.900
you won't be needing
your evil inventions.

42:30.067 --> 42:31.667
- I can use
my weapons for good.

42:31.767 --> 42:36.133
- Uh, how do you plan to use
a helium pain blaster for good?

42:36.233 --> 42:38.167
- It works just
as well on villains.

42:38.267 --> 42:40.200
Here, watch.

42:42.400 --> 42:44.400
- Why are you pointing
that thing at me?

42:46.400 --> 42:49.067
No! Stop! It stings!

42:49.100 --> 42:52.467
Get it off! No!
That's not funny!

42:55.200 --> 42:57.967
- I do like when
villains suffer.

42:58.067 --> 43:00.667
The weapons stay.

43:00.767 --> 43:03.433
- Well, I'm just glad we can
finally put the drama

43:03.533 --> 43:05.433
of the last few
days behind us.

43:05.533 --> 43:10.867
- Electress, you were exposed
as superheroes...on TV.

43:10.967 --> 43:12.567
- So, a few people saw us.

43:12.667 --> 43:15.867
- Yeah, it's not
that big a deal.

43:15.967 --> 43:19.767
- CROWD:

43:22.067 --> 43:25.333
- Okay, it is
that big a deal.

43:25.433 --> 43:28.900
- The Thundermans
are famous, baby!

43:29.067 --> 43:31.067
- BARB:

43:31.100 --> 43:39.333
- *

43:43.567 --> 43:59.267
- *
