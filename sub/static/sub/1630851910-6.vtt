A NETFLIX SERIES

00:50.200 --> 00:51.040
Jorge!

04:33.360 --> 04:37.680
The minister of the presidency
will now address the floor

04:37.760 --> 04:40.400
for his highly anticipated statement.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.600
He is met with enthusiastic applause

04:42.680 --> 04:46.360
as he enters the room
at the National Assembly.

04:46.440 --> 04:49.480
And now for the speech
from Prof. Marcelo Caetano.

04:50.520 --> 04:55.080
An extremely violent surge of terrorism
broke out in Northern Angola,

04:55.760 --> 05:01.840
along with the devastation of large areas,
which now lie in desolation and ruin.

05:01.920 --> 05:06.440
Since 1961, these same factors

05:06.520 --> 05:09.160
have fueled the subversion of Angola,

05:09.240 --> 05:12.920
which later spread
to Guinea and Mozambique.

05:13.480 --> 05:19.080
None of these were grassroots movements
started by native populations.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.160
The funding and weapons
have come from abroad.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.040
In these countries,

05:25.120 --> 05:28.960
namely in the USSR and Communist China,

05:29.480 --> 05:31.120
they are trained…

05:47.600 --> 05:48.640
Fernando, come on!

05:49.600 --> 05:51.680
Shit, Fernando! Let's fucking go!

05:52.360 --> 05:53.800
Fernando!

05:55.920 --> 05:58.200
I don't want to make
a big song and dance about it

05:58.280 --> 06:02.360
because this change in government
is due to misfortune.

06:03.560 --> 06:06.200
But my job

06:06.800 --> 06:12.040
is to serve this government
and nation in the best way I know.

06:12.120 --> 06:15.760
Are you already rehearsing
your inauguration speech?

06:16.560 --> 06:19.000
The Ministry of Defense
is one of the most important.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.080
At this moment,
it has almost half of the state budget.

06:22.680 --> 06:26.720
There's talk of how Marcelo Caetano
may negotiate the end of the war,

06:26.800 --> 06:28.920
but I personally do not believe it.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.040
We should be celebrating,
not talking about serious topics.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.920
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

06:37.640 --> 06:40.200
Father, you are most certainly
up to the challenge.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.360
Thank you, João.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.560
The news is spreading fast.

06:50.760 --> 06:52.760
How are things at RARET?

06:53.600 --> 06:54.600
Good.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.320
You haven't been passing on
any information.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.840
There's nothing to report.

07:04.520 --> 07:07.400
Do you think Prof. Salazar
might still recover?

07:07.480 --> 07:08.640
I doubt it.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.160
If he does,
I'd like to see whoever has to tell him

07:11.240 --> 07:13.720
a new president of the council
was appointed.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.240
We are living in difficult times, João.

07:17.760 --> 07:21.160
It was Alexandre.
He wanted to congratulate you.

07:22.560 --> 07:26.280
I'll talk to him later.
I still have to go to the ministry.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.760
-Today?
-Yes. I want to be up-to-date.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.760
I have a meeting tomorrow

07:31.840 --> 07:34.160
with the secretaries of state
and the advisers.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.000
I want to be prepared.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.560
The life of a politician
doesn't follow a timetable.

07:39.440 --> 07:42.360
I also have to leave.
I'm going back to Glória today.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.040
So I'm going to have dinner alone?

07:45.120 --> 07:49.120
This new arrangement
will require sacrifices from everyone.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.440
-Are you leaving now, Dad?
-Yes.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.440
I'll come with you.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.640
Mom.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.440
-Stay in touch, my darling.
-I will.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.880
Did they catch
the person who killed the Russian?

08:08.840 --> 08:09.880
No.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.440
I'm sure James will want to be
in charge of the investigation.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.920
Right now, the best that he can do
is to be quiet and stay out of the way.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.840
We want to stay neutral.

08:20.360 --> 08:23.520
We don't need the Americans as much
now that we're getting closer

08:23.600 --> 08:25.040
to France and Germany.

08:25.560 --> 08:26.880
What does that mean?

08:27.760 --> 08:30.400
-That you won't investigate the murder?
-Of course we will.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.440
We'll close
and archive the file in a month.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.880
This was the work of professionals, João.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.360
And please take care of yourself.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.360
I will.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.680
Good morning.

10:31.960 --> 10:35.160
-You can handle your drink.
-So can you.

10:39.680 --> 10:43.240
Be careful.
Drunk people tend to talk too much.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.920
Don't worry. I only drink on my own.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.760
You should try to fix
what's going on inside you.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.760
A tune can be played
in many different ways.

11:21.840 --> 11:26.600
You just have to change the harmony,
the tempo, the rhythm…

11:27.320 --> 11:30.760
I thought you said
that jazz was music for degenerates.

11:31.280 --> 11:35.240
I did. But we all have our own quirks.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.200
Shall we head outside?
I need to talk to you. Come on.

11:46.560 --> 11:51.040
Excuse me, do you have a light?

11:57.600 --> 11:58.840
Thank you.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.960
The NATO summit will be this week.

12:11.400 --> 12:15.360
There might be interesting conversations
in James's office.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.200
I'll keep an eye out.

12:29.320 --> 12:34.120
In a few years, we will be building
space stations on the moon.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.040
Maybe even living there.

12:38.160 --> 12:41.000
Sounds like science fiction to me.

12:42.120 --> 12:46.240
Revolution is the engine of history.
And we are building…

12:48.120 --> 12:49.960
The new man.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.280
We should be careful
with what we say here.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.160
You never know who might be listening.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.800
These people are all Catholics
from respectable families.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.000
PIDE doesn't care about them.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.480
No revolution will start here.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.760
Well, I…

13:07.360 --> 13:09.360
I need to go. It's past my bedtime.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.160
But you can stay.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
There's a group of girls over there.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.360
Maybe they'll help you forget
the other young lady.

13:16.440 --> 13:20.160
-I don't know who you're talking about.
-What's her name again?

13:21.760 --> 13:22.760
Carolina.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.040
TRANSMISSION ROOM

14:02.640 --> 14:03.480
Nothing yet?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.720
What's the status report?

14:20.320 --> 14:21.840
Yes, sir.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.120
What is it now?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.160
I don't know.

14:30.240 --> 14:33.800
I'll go outside to see if the power
is out everywhere or just here.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.240
-Why didn't the generator start?
-I don't know.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.440
You two, come with me.

14:44.520 --> 14:45.600
Yeah, I'll go.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.600
It seems that I do know
what I'm doing after all.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.640
Both valves are ruined.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.280
-Do you need help?
-You're too late, Vidal.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.880
Two valves.
Organize a driver to go to Lisbon.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.600
Now!

18:00.600 --> 18:02.520
You haven't had black bass
for a while now.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.760
It's because of the woman
they found in the dam.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.320
I heard that the fish got bigger
with all that they ate.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.600
I won't be having lunch, then.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.080
These were caught in the Tagus River.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.000
You never know.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.400
Did you know her well?
Who was she engaged to?

18:21.440 --> 18:22.440
Engaged?

18:23.600 --> 18:25.200
Who told you that she was engaged?

18:25.280 --> 18:28.120
When they got her out of the water,
I saw an engagement ring.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.680
Are you sure?

18:33.600 --> 18:36.000
Yes, I am. It had pearls in it.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.760
-Did you know?
-No.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.480
I never saw her wearing that ring.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.880
João, when people get to the morgue,

19:44.960 --> 19:47.840
they don't have all
they had on them when they were found.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.400
Who keeps the stuff?

19:49.920 --> 19:54.160
It could be the firefighters,
the police, the people who found the body.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.280
Why are you interested in that ring?

19:58.080 --> 20:00.400
Your curiosity
is going to get you in trouble.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.920
She wasn't Portuguese.
She didn't have family here.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.800
-Maybe she didn't tell anyone.
-Or maybe her fiancé was still married.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.760
Well, even so,
that's none of your business.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.480
What if someone wanted
to make her disappear?

20:18.960 --> 20:22.440
Is this an investigation
for the Portuguese or the Americans?

20:26.400 --> 20:27.480
Why do you ask?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.760
Because you've been asking
a lot of questions.

20:29.840 --> 20:32.080
You know that makes no sense.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.520
Lots of things don't make sense at RARET.

20:35.080 --> 20:39.240
That's why it's better not to ask.
You might not like the answers.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.600
Who are you protecting?

20:42.120 --> 20:43.280
No one, João.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.680
You know that we were friends.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.320
If you were such good friends,
you would know that she was engaged.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.280
If anyone asks,
you didn't get this from me.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.280
Why did you keep it?

21:09.920 --> 21:14.040
Because I believe
that people are allowed to have secrets.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.040
July 4th.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.440
She got engaged at the party?

21:20.520 --> 21:22.360
The less I know, the better.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.480
Can I keep the ring?

21:26.960 --> 21:27.920
What ring?

21:29.480 --> 21:30.360
Thank you.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.240
What happened?

21:50.680 --> 21:52.160
Take it easy, Vitalina.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.920
You killed him.

21:54.440 --> 21:58.320
If you had just fled to France,
he would still be alive.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.520
It's no one's fault.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.280
My son!

22:14.480 --> 22:15.960
They're giving him a medal.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.240
No…

22:36.680 --> 22:37.720
Come in.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.400
Excuse me.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.000
Sorry to bother you, sir,
but I really need to talk to you.

22:46.080 --> 22:46.920
Sure.

22:48.440 --> 22:49.720
It's about Carolina.

22:57.360 --> 22:58.960
What about Carolina?

23:00.240 --> 23:01.240
She's a widow now.

23:13.880 --> 23:17.160
Why are you telling me that?
Did she ask you to tell me?

23:17.240 --> 23:18.080
No.

23:18.920 --> 23:21.000
But the body has not been recovered yet.

23:21.520 --> 23:22.880
And I thought…

23:23.480 --> 23:26.000
You have a lot of contacts,
and maybe you could help

23:26.080 --> 23:29.040
so they don't just leave the body
in Guinea.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.400
The family would like
to give him a funeral.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.560
I will see what I can do.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.960
Thank you.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.120
One more thing.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.160
Give Carolina some space.

23:49.680 --> 23:52.880
She has enough problems,
if you know what I mean.

23:54.360 --> 23:55.960
She doesn't talk about it,

23:56.480 --> 23:59.040
but I know she feels guilty
about Fernando's death.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.280
No one is to blame.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.080
Not even the soldier who killed him.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.440
At least, directly.

25:48.600 --> 25:52.920
That's why they're funding
Cuban refugees in Miami to lead a coup.

25:54.560 --> 25:57.280
I will send the information
to Moscow tonight.

26:07.480 --> 26:10.480
JAMES WILSON'S OFFICE

27:09.760 --> 27:10.840
You're here?

27:12.400 --> 27:14.400
I came to see you. Do you have a light?

27:15.760 --> 27:18.880
Why? You should be resting.
Your shift starts at 8:00.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.360
I found Mia's ring.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.680
Where? Are you sure it was hers?

27:25.760 --> 27:29.520
Positive. It has "4-7-1968" written on it.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.240
The American holiday?

27:33.360 --> 27:35.080
She got engaged at the party.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.680
Be strong.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.640
Go sit with your mother-in-law.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.960
She doesn't want me here.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.800
Listen, Carolina.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.280
You're Fernando's widow.

28:38.360 --> 28:41.760
You have to sit in the front.
Go on now. Go.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.120
Fernando loved you so much.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.280
And I know you cared about him too.

31:41.880 --> 31:43.920
Pravda. 3-6-1.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.400
3-6-1 for the Palace, I'm listening.

33:15.600 --> 33:18.520
3-6-1. Pravda. I'm listening.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.800
3-6-1. For…

33:58.640 --> 34:01.520
Pravda. 3-6-1 for the Palace.
I'm listening.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.720
Irina, it's me.

34:06.640 --> 34:10.160
Just a second.

34:10.240 --> 34:11.520
Irina.

34:17.760 --> 34:18.960
Come with me.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.320
We've been compromised.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.360
You can't send anything to Moscow.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.120
-We have to go now.
-Run!

34:41.680 --> 34:43.120
Go on, run!

34:45.120 --> 34:48.200
-Are you coming with me?
-Go, save yourself! Run!

34:50.520 --> 34:52.280
Go on. Run, quickly!

38:43.520 --> 38:44.720
João!
