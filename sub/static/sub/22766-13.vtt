WEBVTT

00:04.745 --> 00:07.313
- Another "3-oh" Prolene.
- Here.

00:09.416 --> 00:11.317
Homestretch, Peter.

00:11.352 --> 00:13.203
Just finishing up the aortic connection.

00:13.228 --> 00:14.761
Then we'll start you back up.

00:14.856 --> 00:17.089
Talking to the patient
while they're out,

00:17.124 --> 00:18.490
that's a new one.

00:18.525 --> 00:20.659
- It's a nice touch.
- Actually, not new.

00:20.694 --> 00:22.526
Just the first time you've noticed.

00:22.562 --> 00:24.406
Thought I'd made more of
an impression on you.

00:24.431 --> 00:26.358
The way you can turn a
compliment into a dig,

00:26.383 --> 00:28.599
it's quite the skill, Dr. Bekker.

00:28.623 --> 00:31.172
Don't be so sensitive, Dr. Rhodes.

00:31.859 --> 00:34.794
Okay, donor heart is fully attached.

00:34.829 --> 00:36.329
- All right.
- Let's get the pacer leads on.

00:36.364 --> 00:38.331
Yes, doctor.

00:38.366 --> 00:42.302
- 100 beats per minute, Marty.
- We're set.

00:42.337 --> 00:44.213
Okay then, turn it on.

00:46.886 --> 00:49.887
Excellent contractility in the
left and right ventricles.

00:49.912 --> 00:51.754
- No distension.
- Healthy color.

00:51.779 --> 00:53.412
Take off bypass?

00:53.447 --> 00:55.935
Looks like this one's
going to take, Peter.

00:57.001 --> 00:59.301
There's no better sight, is there, Dr.
Bekker?

00:59.326 --> 01:00.898
Can't argue with that.

01:04.646 --> 01:07.169
- No, no, no!
- Losing color. It's cyanotic.

01:07.194 --> 01:08.861
Global contractility's way down.

01:08.896 --> 01:10.663
Left and right ventricles
severely distended.

01:10.698 --> 01:12.131
Hyperacute rejection.

01:12.166 --> 01:14.500
Donor heart's failing. We
need to get it out now.

01:14.535 --> 01:16.769
Damn it. Okay, back on bypass.

01:22.734 --> 01:28.555
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:29.216 --> 01:32.451
Okay, Peter obviously goes
back on the transplant list,

01:32.486 --> 01:34.492
but for right now, I
only see two options:

01:34.517 --> 01:37.218
- ECMO or an artificial heart.
- ECMO's quick and easy.

01:37.243 --> 01:39.109
Peter's on bypass, so the
cannulas are already in place.

01:39.134 --> 01:41.838
Downside, he'd be confined to
the ICU and likely intubated.

01:41.863 --> 01:45.098
- I'm leaning artificial.
- That is a huge surgery.

01:45.123 --> 01:47.289
Peter's already been on the
table for over four hours.

01:47.314 --> 01:49.516
The risk of complications,
especially stroke?

01:49.541 --> 01:51.937
But if all goes well, he
could get out of bed,

01:51.962 --> 01:54.070
walk around, maybe even go home.

01:54.202 --> 01:56.380
Peter waited a year for
his first donor heart,

01:56.405 --> 01:58.820
two and a half for the
one that just failed.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.593
There's no telling how
long the next will take.

02:00.618 --> 02:02.921
Then I guess you really
only have one option.

02:06.318 --> 02:08.336
It's Peter's wife, Jane.

02:08.824 --> 02:11.265
Not the post-op conversation
I was planning for.

02:11.406 --> 02:13.781
Dr. Rhodes, Dr. Halstead
called from the E.D.

02:13.806 --> 02:14.805
while you were in surgery,

02:14.830 --> 02:16.601
asked that you find him
the moment you're free.

02:16.626 --> 02:18.259
- Thank you.
- Mm.

02:18.387 --> 02:21.498
It's Dan Kennet, my giant-cell
myocarditis patient.

02:21.633 --> 02:23.770
- He's back.
- Go. I've got this.

02:23.858 --> 02:25.224
All right.

02:26.934 --> 02:29.653
April, this thing tonight,
how big we talking?

02:30.152 --> 02:32.503
It's my little cousin's
15th birthday, okay?

02:32.528 --> 02:33.862
It's gonna be some of her friends,

02:33.887 --> 02:36.188
a few family members, low-key.

02:36.223 --> 02:37.738
Yeah, right. You always say that.

02:37.763 --> 02:39.988
Then I get there and it's Carnival.

02:40.292 --> 02:41.659
In Brazilian culture,

02:41.684 --> 02:43.551
fifteen's a huge birthday for a girl.

02:43.576 --> 02:45.114
Baile De Debutante.

02:45.139 --> 02:47.237
- Uh, did you Google that?
- Yeah.

02:47.262 --> 02:49.926
Okay, that's really cute.

02:50.098 --> 02:51.809
Oh, you're gonna bring your sister?

02:51.938 --> 02:53.426
I wasn't planning on it.

02:53.451 --> 02:54.601
Come on, you guys have been talking.

02:54.626 --> 02:56.136
Things are going well, right?

02:56.161 --> 02:59.628
Yeah, but Emily's always
been kind of a wild card.

02:59.891 --> 03:01.313
I don't wanna spend the
whole night worrying

03:01.338 --> 03:03.705
she'll do something to
offend your family.

03:03.819 --> 03:05.486
Plus, she probably has a poker game.

03:05.511 --> 03:06.722
Lame.

03:06.747 --> 03:08.647
All right, I'm not gonna push.

03:08.672 --> 03:10.405
I'd really like to meet her, though.

03:10.430 --> 03:11.608
You will...

03:12.603 --> 03:13.986
one day.

03:15.313 --> 03:16.770
He fainted?

03:16.795 --> 03:18.033
Yeah, getting out of the shower.

03:18.058 --> 03:19.215
When I pressed for details,

03:19.240 --> 03:21.106
he confessed to being
light-headed all week.

03:21.131 --> 03:22.004
Labs?

03:22.029 --> 03:23.825
Yeah, troponin's way too high.

03:23.850 --> 03:26.903
Left ventricular ejection
fraction is 10%.

03:27.133 --> 03:28.793
I've been treating Dan for six months.

03:28.818 --> 03:31.086
Steroids, calcium channel blockers,

03:31.111 --> 03:32.683
ace inhibitors, beta blockers,

03:32.708 --> 03:35.715
no matter what I try, he
just keeps getting worse.

03:35.740 --> 03:37.927
Where is he on the transplant list?

03:38.460 --> 03:39.929
Way too low.

03:40.459 --> 03:42.159
Don't let him give up.

03:47.184 --> 03:50.285
Aww.

03:50.321 --> 03:52.254
Hey, Dan. Hey, Sheila.

03:52.289 --> 03:55.012
Hey. We're back too soon.

03:58.285 --> 04:00.495
Listen, Dan, your heart is failing,

04:00.530 --> 04:03.431
so I'm going to adjust the
meds that you're already on

04:03.466 --> 04:05.722
and add IV dobutamine.

04:06.292 --> 04:07.980
IV?

04:08.327 --> 04:11.043
Guess I'm not going home today, am I?

04:11.141 --> 04:13.675
Yeah, we've gotta get the inflammation

04:13.710 --> 04:15.543
of your heart muscle under control.

04:15.568 --> 04:17.882
How long in the ICU?

04:18.492 --> 04:20.723
I'm not sure, I'm sorry.

04:21.834 --> 04:23.634
Hey, little B.

04:23.826 --> 04:25.559
Hi.

04:25.584 --> 04:27.190
The hospital has a daycare center.

04:27.215 --> 04:29.168
- I can, uh, call...
- No, no.

04:29.558 --> 04:33.590
Having them close keeps me...
keeps my spirits up.

04:33.615 --> 04:36.348
Good. That's what we want.

04:36.846 --> 04:38.418
I'll see you guys soon, all right?

04:38.443 --> 04:39.738
All right.

04:43.611 --> 04:46.152
Hey, take it from the old guy,

04:46.382 --> 04:49.434
ease up or you get a bunch of these.

04:49.913 --> 04:51.840
What are you grinding on?

04:52.066 --> 04:54.871
My dad asked me to cosign on a loan.

04:55.303 --> 04:56.703
Huh.

04:56.728 --> 04:58.826
Northwestern offered him
a tenure-track position.

04:58.851 --> 05:00.778
He's gonna buy a place in Chicago.

05:00.803 --> 05:03.567
- Isn't that great news?
- Yeah.

05:04.410 --> 05:07.153
I can get through the most
arcane medical jargon,

05:07.178 --> 05:09.387
but legalese? Impossible.

05:09.412 --> 05:10.969
I just wanna know what I'm signing.

05:10.994 --> 05:13.168
- Is that too much to ask?
- Not at all.

05:13.359 --> 05:15.246
Cosigning a loan is a big deal.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.471
- Mm.
- If the borrower defaults,

05:17.496 --> 05:20.246
you're on the hook for the money, right?

05:20.271 --> 05:21.676
Mm-hmm.

05:21.959 --> 05:24.626
Another little piece of
advice from the old guy:

05:24.651 --> 05:26.517
finances and family,

05:26.542 --> 05:28.350
they don't always mix.

05:28.375 --> 05:30.854
Oh, no, Dr. Charles, my dad
is good for the money.

05:30.879 --> 05:32.364
He just needs me to cosign

05:32.389 --> 05:36.309
because identity theft messed
up his credit a few years ago.

05:38.074 --> 05:39.429
Huh.

05:39.454 --> 05:41.035
So when did your back
start bothering you?

05:41.060 --> 05:43.052
Oh, it's been killing
me since last night.

05:43.077 --> 05:45.487
Listen, I probably overdid
it in my spin class.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.262
I've been working on my stamina.

05:47.287 --> 05:49.921
We're off to Italy tonight,
bike trip through Tuscany...

05:49.946 --> 05:51.535
- Oh, yeah?
- Our 30th anniversary.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.460
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

05:53.485 --> 05:56.903
All right, so let me know if
you feel anything tender...

05:56.928 --> 05:58.684
- Okay.
- Okay?

05:59.438 --> 06:02.715
The spinning, is that a new
activity to prep for the trip?

06:02.740 --> 06:06.174
Um, yeah. And also, I've
been trying to lose the...

06:06.199 --> 06:08.665
Twenty-ish pounds I
gained over the winter.

06:08.690 --> 06:10.223
Obviously, it's not working.

06:10.259 --> 06:12.746
But muscle weighs more than
fat, isn't that right?

06:12.771 --> 06:14.737
Don't answer that.

06:15.025 --> 06:17.025
Are you on any medications, Mrs. Davis?

06:17.060 --> 06:19.315
Yeah, I'm on hormone
replacement therapy.

06:19.340 --> 06:20.809
I'm at high risk for osteoporosis,

06:20.834 --> 06:23.856
so I started the hormones
after menopause.

06:24.123 --> 06:26.379
- No midline abnormalities.
- Okay.

06:26.583 --> 06:29.465
Is, uh... do you have any
burning with urination?

06:29.490 --> 06:31.505
Um, no, although lately,

06:31.530 --> 06:34.106
it does seem like I have
to go every ten minutes.

06:34.131 --> 06:35.832
Our granddaughter just
got out of diapers.

06:35.857 --> 06:37.934
I guess I'm on my way into them.

06:37.959 --> 06:40.538
Well, looks like it's
just a muscle strain.

06:40.563 --> 06:41.473
Really?

06:41.498 --> 06:44.606
Yeah, a 10 of Flexeril
and 800 of Ibuprofen.

06:44.631 --> 06:46.816
And, uh, I'll check back in an hour,

06:46.841 --> 06:47.809
see how you're feeling.

06:47.834 --> 06:49.661
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

06:50.539 --> 06:52.497
- Muscle strain.
- Mm.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.292
- Maggie...
- Uh-huh?

06:55.317 --> 06:56.519
I need a doctor in the waiting room.

06:56.544 --> 06:58.375
Got it. Dr. Choi, we're up.

06:58.610 --> 07:00.003
LaShawn, hold onto this.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.547
- Be quiet, please!
- Are you okay?

07:01.572 --> 07:03.676
Clear out, clear out. Here, here, here.

07:03.701 --> 07:05.868
Sir, take this chair and
move it, please, thank you.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.996
She kept falling over onto
the person next to her.

07:08.021 --> 07:08.926
I can't wake her up.

07:08.951 --> 07:10.785
Ma'am... ma'am, can you hear me?

07:11.125 --> 07:12.950
She's snoring, so she's
protecting her airway.

07:12.975 --> 07:13.942
Able to breathe, good pulse.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.871
Who is she? Patient here to be seen?

07:15.896 --> 07:17.379
No idea, she never checked in with me.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.903
Anyone know who she is?

07:18.928 --> 07:20.403
Mags, see if there's an ID.

07:20.428 --> 07:22.379
Yeah. I got it.

07:22.404 --> 07:25.309
Illinois driver's license.
Her name is Rachel Wexler.

07:25.334 --> 07:26.973
30 years old, lives in Evanston.

07:26.998 --> 07:28.090
- That's not close.
- No.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.965
Don't know why she's here,
but she's a patient now.

07:29.990 --> 07:31.582
All right, get ready to clear out.

07:31.607 --> 07:33.707
Move, people, move, move,
move, move, move, move!

07:33.732 --> 07:35.059
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

07:35.084 --> 07:37.090
- Doris, Treatment Four.
- What do we got?

07:37.115 --> 07:38.614
Fell asleep, now won't wake up.

07:38.639 --> 07:40.246
- OD?
- That's my guess.

07:40.271 --> 07:41.832
A drop and dash, or maybe a last fling,

07:41.857 --> 07:43.153
before coming in to get treatment.

07:43.178 --> 07:44.978
- Doris, push 2 of Narcan.
- Yep.

07:46.348 --> 07:47.914
Mags, any more info from her purse?

07:47.949 --> 07:50.230
Wallet, keys, makeup, gum,

07:50.255 --> 07:53.503
birth control pills, and
cigarettes, nothing helpful.

07:53.528 --> 07:56.887
BP, 104 over 68, heartrate, 72,

07:56.912 --> 07:59.712
pulse ox, 99%, EKG, normal sinus rhythm.

07:59.737 --> 08:02.567
Not exactly OD vitals, Dr. Choi.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.253
- No response to Narcan.
- I told you.

08:05.278 --> 08:07.737
Narcan only counteracts opiates.
Must be a benzo.

08:07.762 --> 08:10.340
Push .4 of Flumazenil,
and order a CBC, CMP,

08:10.365 --> 08:12.195
ammonia levels, arterial blood gas, BAC,

08:12.220 --> 08:13.809
and blood and urine tox screens.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.515
Maggie, she's wearing a wedding ring.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.160
Can you find a contact for a spouse?

08:17.185 --> 08:19.018
Would if I could, but no cell phone,

08:19.182 --> 08:22.465
but a charger, so I'm guessing
she had one at some point.

08:22.490 --> 08:24.824
If she stumbled in here high,
who knows where she lost it.

08:24.849 --> 08:26.347
Flumazenil's not working either.

08:26.372 --> 08:27.730
Okay, OD's out.

08:27.755 --> 08:30.028
Doris, add an HCG,

08:30.053 --> 08:32.261
a CT chest, spine,

08:32.287 --> 08:34.654
um, abdomen and pelvis to the test.

08:34.679 --> 08:35.441
Got it.

08:35.466 --> 08:37.121
Dr. Stohl, you're thinking injury?

08:37.255 --> 08:38.900
All I'm seeing is a scar
on her right cheek,

08:38.926 --> 08:40.259
but it's old, clearly healed.

08:40.284 --> 08:41.363
Just because there's no bruising

08:41.388 --> 08:42.687
doesn't mean there's no trauma.

08:42.712 --> 08:44.441
You should know that, Dr. Choi.

08:50.870 --> 08:52.520
So, I took a second look at your echo,

08:52.545 --> 08:54.770
and I wanna start you on dexamethasone.

08:54.795 --> 08:57.277
It's another anti-inflammatory.

08:57.493 --> 09:00.594
Whatever you think is best, do it.

09:03.566 --> 09:06.589
- How'd it go?
- Surgery went well.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.315
Peter's artificial heart is in.

09:08.350 --> 09:11.151
Let's hope it lasts until a
donor heart becomes available.

09:11.186 --> 09:13.619
Peter's Status One on
the transplant list.

09:13.655 --> 09:15.371
He's got a chance.

09:15.396 --> 09:17.167
My patient, Dan, he's Status Two.

09:17.192 --> 09:20.027
I am waiting for a call that's
probably never gonna come.

09:20.052 --> 09:24.187
GCM's brutal but not usually
discovered until autopsy.

09:24.305 --> 09:26.692
- You're way ahead of it.
- I was.

09:26.837 --> 09:28.737
Now I'm just playing catch-up.

09:32.903 --> 09:35.241
23-year-old male.

09:35.266 --> 09:37.567
Went down on his motorcycle
just outside Bloomington.

09:37.603 --> 09:39.687
- Wasn't wearing a helmet.
- Massive brain hemorrhaging?

09:39.712 --> 09:41.241
Rural hospital's been working on him,

09:41.266 --> 09:43.033
but he's worse than they can handle.

09:43.058 --> 09:45.367
GCS, 3, down six hours already.

09:45.392 --> 09:48.125
Crap scans. Doubt we can do much better.

09:49.302 --> 09:50.871
You know what they call a motorcyclist

09:50.896 --> 09:52.554
riding without a helmet, don't you?

09:52.579 --> 09:53.984
One, two, three.

09:54.009 --> 09:56.176
An organ donor.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:07.640 --> 10:09.262
Well, she's not catatonic.

10:09.287 --> 10:10.937
Whatever knocked her out,
it's not psychiatric.

10:10.962 --> 10:13.070
- What'd her tox screens show?
- Yeah, she's clean.

10:13.095 --> 10:15.655
Blood alcohol, arterial gases,
and all other labs too.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.227
- Diabetic Ketoacidosis?
- Blood sugar's normal.

10:18.252 --> 10:20.185
- Liver failure?
- Ammonia level's normal.

10:20.210 --> 10:21.085
Tumor?

10:21.110 --> 10:23.277
Chest X-ray and all the CTs were clean.

10:23.302 --> 10:25.620
- The scar on her cheek?
- Plate from an old fracture.

10:25.645 --> 10:27.680
No apparent connection
to her unconsciousness.

10:27.705 --> 10:29.186
Just got off the phone with PD.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.787
Ruzek ran Rachel's name
through the system.

10:30.812 --> 10:33.758
She got busted a few
times: DUI and possession.

10:33.783 --> 10:35.999
And yet a clean tox and BAC.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.902
Hmm, the plot thickens.

10:38.047 --> 10:39.613
Good luck.

10:44.148 --> 10:45.514
Hey.

10:45.549 --> 10:47.123
Hi, Natalie. Just getting here?

10:47.148 --> 10:48.848
Yeah, remember, it was my turn

10:48.884 --> 10:51.117
to be volunteer mom at
Owen's daycare class.

10:51.152 --> 10:52.819
Oh, right, yeah.

10:52.854 --> 10:54.353
Three hours and 20 toddlers,

10:54.389 --> 10:57.671
do you have any idea how
many boogers that is?

10:57.985 --> 10:59.718
Ha, I'll bet.

10:59.895 --> 11:02.862
Okay... not my best material,

11:02.898 --> 11:04.937
but not even a courtesy laugh?

11:05.093 --> 11:08.127
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm just tired.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.963
- Are you sure?
- No, yeah, I'm good.

11:11.781 --> 11:14.836
Dr. Manning, you're up. You're
going to Treatment Two.

11:14.861 --> 11:16.953
Okay. Hey, I'll catch you later?

11:16.978 --> 11:19.023
Okay.

11:19.851 --> 11:22.093
Sam Covington, 27-year-old male.

11:22.118 --> 11:23.734
Hypotensive and tachypneic.

11:23.759 --> 11:25.648
Long-term care patient following a TBI.

11:25.673 --> 11:27.569
How long ago did he
sustain the brain injury?

11:27.594 --> 11:29.992
Um, five years. It was
a surfing accident.

11:30.024 --> 11:31.750
He was only 22.

11:31.775 --> 11:35.117
Just graduated from
UCSD, magna cum laude.

11:35.142 --> 11:37.422
Mm, sorry, you don't
need to know all that.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.109
Mom, I take it?

11:39.609 --> 11:42.142
All right, let's transfer
him on my count.

11:42.167 --> 11:44.868
Ready, one, two, three.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.273
- Temp, 101.6.
- Mm-kay.

12:00.645 --> 12:02.508
Congested on both sides.

12:02.770 --> 12:04.726
Mom, hey, I just got your message.

12:04.751 --> 12:06.093
Sorry, I was in class. What happened?

12:06.118 --> 12:07.148
Is-is Sam okay?

12:07.181 --> 12:09.078
Uh, your brother was breathing fast,

12:09.103 --> 12:10.669
and, um, he...

12:10.694 --> 12:13.133
He looked like he was in pain.

12:13.158 --> 12:15.475
Uh, let's get a CBC, CMP, ABG,

12:15.500 --> 12:17.008
a UA, and blood cultures,

12:17.033 --> 12:18.967
and begin sepsis protocol.

12:19.282 --> 12:20.715
Excuse me, sorry.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.840
- Start him on antibiotics.
- That's a lot of tests.

12:22.865 --> 12:25.983
I understand, but since Sam
can't tell us where it hurts,

12:26.008 --> 12:27.820
it's better to err on
the side of caution.

12:27.845 --> 12:29.578
Okay?

12:53.472 --> 12:55.138
Take as much time with
your son as you need.

12:55.163 --> 12:56.440
When you're ready, someone will come

12:56.465 --> 12:58.324
speak with you about organ donation.

13:04.236 --> 13:06.518
- What happened?
- Motorcycle accident.

13:06.543 --> 13:08.291
Never had a chance.

13:14.512 --> 13:17.292
Soon as the immunotyping
results are in, find me.

13:17.317 --> 13:18.682
Yeah, okay.

13:25.956 --> 13:28.987
- So, how we feeling?
- Ugh, my back is better,

13:29.012 --> 13:30.793
but now I'm feeling really queasy.

13:30.818 --> 13:32.284
All of a sudden, it just hit her.

13:32.309 --> 13:34.206
- A reaction to the Flexeril?
- Yeah, maybe.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.097
Um, can... can I take a look?

13:36.122 --> 13:38.081
Okay, uh-huh...

13:40.883 --> 13:42.743
Oh, gosh.

13:44.065 --> 13:45.744
Mm.

13:47.433 --> 13:49.283
- April, can I...
- Sorry.

13:49.308 --> 13:53.109
Mm... can I get, um, 4
milligrams of Zofran?

13:53.134 --> 13:55.421
Uh, and if you'll excuse me, I'll...

13:55.730 --> 13:58.339
- I'll be right back.
- Sorry.

13:58.364 --> 14:01.599
No, yes, it's, um... It's no...
it's no problem.

14:03.866 --> 14:05.365
Sorry.

14:05.517 --> 14:08.081
- Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
- Oh, he's fine.

14:08.106 --> 14:11.190
First-year resident, projectile
vomit is a rite of passage.

14:11.234 --> 14:13.885
- I'll get you a gown.
- Thank you.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.775
- Oh, my God.
- Are you all right?

14:19.660 --> 14:21.293
Daniel, there you are.

14:21.318 --> 14:24.166
The next round of prospective
transplant candidates.

14:24.191 --> 14:25.409
No rest for the wicked.

14:25.434 --> 14:28.382
Dr. Reese's father, Robert
Haywood, is in this stack:

14:28.407 --> 14:30.498
Class Three heart failure.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.487
I hope he makes a strong candidate.

14:33.512 --> 14:35.504
You'll keep me in the loop?

14:36.641 --> 14:38.407
Uh, Daniel?

14:38.432 --> 14:40.581
Yes. Yes, of course.

14:40.606 --> 14:42.051
Could you excuse me?

14:44.440 --> 14:46.474
Dan?

14:46.506 --> 14:47.674
- Dan?
- Daddy?

14:47.699 --> 14:50.145
Get the crash cart! Paddles now.

14:50.881 --> 14:52.446
Come here.

14:53.996 --> 14:55.328
Come...

14:55.353 --> 14:57.319
No pulse or breathing, He's in V-fib.

14:57.344 --> 15:00.111
Get on his chest. Charge to 200.

15:00.369 --> 15:02.472
Charged.

15:02.497 --> 15:05.190
All right, hold compressions. Clear!

15:08.081 --> 15:10.514
Charge again. Amp of epi.

15:10.539 --> 15:12.405
Epi's in. Charged.

15:12.430 --> 15:13.958
All right, clear!

15:15.555 --> 15:17.788
- He's hurting Daddy!
- No, honey...

15:17.813 --> 15:19.469
Charge again. Amp of epi.

15:19.494 --> 15:20.979
- He's just trying to help.
- Come on, Dan.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.362
- Beat, damn it. Come on.
- Meds are in.

15:23.599 --> 15:25.636
- Charged.
- Hold compressions. Clear.

15:32.423 --> 15:33.685
He's back.

15:36.654 --> 15:38.353
Thank you.

15:44.815 --> 15:47.189
So, I'm not getting on
the transplant list?

15:47.214 --> 15:48.394
I didn't say that.

15:48.419 --> 15:51.579
I'm just making you aware
that personality disorders

15:51.604 --> 15:53.876
can be a contraindication of transplant.

15:53.901 --> 15:56.628
You believe I have Antisocial
Personality Disorder,

15:56.653 --> 15:59.072
but another psychiatrist might not.

15:59.097 --> 16:02.032
It's-it's a pretty gray
area, wouldn't you say?

16:02.067 --> 16:03.627
Well, actually it isn't.

16:03.652 --> 16:05.619
Uh, take a look at this.

16:05.644 --> 16:08.946
This is a PET scan of your brain.

16:10.943 --> 16:12.575
Taken...

16:12.610 --> 16:15.995
when Dr. Rhodes was conducting
his thoracic study?

16:16.944 --> 16:18.151
That's right.

16:21.425 --> 16:23.035
And this supports your diagnosis?

16:23.060 --> 16:25.261
- Mm.
- Well...

16:25.286 --> 16:28.494
since you're bound by
doctor-patient confidentiality,

16:28.519 --> 16:30.908
I just say we keep this to ourselves.

16:31.799 --> 16:33.431
I'm afraid that's not an option.

16:33.456 --> 16:35.757
Um, I am obliged

16:35.849 --> 16:38.816
to report my findings to
the evaluation committee.

16:40.959 --> 16:43.457
I didn't realize you had such
influence on the process,

16:43.482 --> 16:44.963
Dr. Charles.

16:48.679 --> 16:51.391
My heart meds. Do you have any water?

16:51.913 --> 16:53.430
Of course.

16:53.455 --> 16:55.417
Um, by the way,

16:55.442 --> 16:57.532
contraindication isn't absolute.

16:57.557 --> 17:00.091
I mean, taking positive steps
to manage your disorder

17:00.116 --> 17:02.237
can go a long way to
mitigating concerns.

17:02.262 --> 17:04.362
Well, I hope you have some suggestions.

17:04.387 --> 17:06.088
Well, what the committee's looking for

17:06.113 --> 17:08.127
- is self-sufficiency...
- Mm-hmm?

17:08.153 --> 17:11.066
- Fiscal responsibility...
- Fiscal responsibility?

17:11.530 --> 17:13.424
You wouldn't by any
chance be referring to

17:13.449 --> 17:15.565
the loan I asked Sarah to cosign?

17:15.589 --> 17:17.858
Anything you can do to
establish independence...

17:17.883 --> 17:21.207
Perhaps rescind the request.

17:22.051 --> 17:23.877
Would certainly count in your favor.

17:25.808 --> 17:27.239
I'm sorry, Bob, you know,

17:27.263 --> 17:29.285
they come up against us all the time.

17:29.467 --> 17:31.190
There are simply too many people

17:31.215 --> 17:33.511
waiting for too few organs.

17:34.389 --> 17:37.495
I really appreciate you
giving me this advice.

17:42.635 --> 17:44.878
Hi.

17:44.903 --> 17:46.684
Dr. Manning, this is my sister, Lizzie.

17:46.709 --> 17:48.316
She just drove down from Racine.

17:48.341 --> 17:50.320
Nice to meet you.

17:50.726 --> 17:53.060
Uh, how long was I sleeping?

17:53.328 --> 17:55.697
Lizzie, whe... when did you get here?

17:55.722 --> 17:57.097
Just now, Mom.

17:57.122 --> 17:58.862
"Eddie would go"? Who's Eddie?

17:58.887 --> 18:00.353
Eddie Aikau:

18:00.378 --> 18:03.717
legendary big wave surfer and
lifeguard at Waimea Bay.

18:03.742 --> 18:05.823
He'd charge waves no
one else would dare.

18:05.848 --> 18:07.511
Sam's hero.

18:07.902 --> 18:10.803
So we got the results back
from Sam's labs and X-rays.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.895
Um, I'm afraid he has pneumonia.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.694
The antibiotics should knock it out.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.941
Right now, we'd like to
swap out Sam's trach tube

18:16.966 --> 18:18.230
so we can put him on the vent,

18:18.255 --> 18:20.432
you know, give his
respiratory system a rest.

18:20.457 --> 18:21.976
Okay?

18:22.058 --> 18:24.204
No, no, it's okay.

18:24.229 --> 18:28.192
Honey, honey, it's okay. Just...
she'll-she'll be gentle.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.417
Okay...

18:44.448 --> 18:47.583
Monique, pass me the new trach tube.

19:05.522 --> 19:09.565
Hey, that's, um,
Rachel's husband, Jacob.

19:09.590 --> 19:11.790
- Where'd you find him?
- He found us.

19:12.115 --> 19:13.683
He kept on calling her voice mail

19:13.708 --> 19:15.565
and finally used a "find my phone" app,

19:15.590 --> 19:17.003
which led him to the waiting room.

19:17.028 --> 19:18.828
Her phone was buried
in the chair cushion.

19:18.948 --> 19:21.149
- Thanks, Mags.
- Yeah.

19:25.179 --> 19:26.800
- Mr. Wexler...
- Hey.

19:26.887 --> 19:28.636
I'm Dr. Choi. I've been
treating your wife.

19:28.661 --> 19:30.095
What's wrong with her?

19:30.120 --> 19:32.113
Well, we don't know yet.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.174
All her tests have been negative,

19:34.199 --> 19:36.011
including the tox screen.

19:36.036 --> 19:38.261
But given your wife's drug history...

19:38.286 --> 19:40.323
- You think she overdosed?
- She might have taken

19:40.348 --> 19:42.032
something that's beating the test,

19:42.057 --> 19:43.978
possibly a synthetic.

19:44.211 --> 19:46.690
Rachel was in a car
accident a few years ago.

19:46.830 --> 19:48.525
Airbag broke her jaw

19:48.550 --> 19:50.193
and a bone in her cheek.

19:50.386 --> 19:52.686
The injuries healed,
but the pain pills...

19:52.711 --> 19:54.034
After her last arrest,

19:54.059 --> 19:56.192
she promised that she'd stay clean.

19:58.152 --> 19:59.979
Here we go again.

20:25.903 --> 20:27.501
Meds alone aren't taking

20:27.526 --> 20:29.224
enough pressure off of Dan's heart,

20:29.322 --> 20:31.690
so I am going to put him on ECMO.

20:32.651 --> 20:34.393
Full support, so that his heart

20:34.418 --> 20:36.058
doesn't have to shoulder any load.

20:36.083 --> 20:38.729
When you first diagnosed the GCM,

20:38.754 --> 20:41.089
you said ECMO was a final option.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.648
Mm-hmm.

20:42.673 --> 20:45.038
I told myself...

20:47.340 --> 20:49.210
To make a plan,

20:49.959 --> 20:51.893
to prepare for this moment,

20:51.918 --> 20:53.818
but I couldn't do it.

20:57.141 --> 20:58.845
It felt like giving up.

20:58.992 --> 21:00.843
I promise you...

21:01.272 --> 21:03.178
that's not what's happening here.

21:03.995 --> 21:05.429
Okay?

21:24.558 --> 21:26.124
How's your TBI patient?

21:26.160 --> 21:27.759
Saw pneumonia on his chart.

21:27.794 --> 21:29.928
Pretty sure he got it
from his trach tube.

21:29.963 --> 21:31.263
It was filthy.

21:31.298 --> 21:32.931
His mom's his caregiver.

21:32.966 --> 21:35.434
Looks like she hasn't been
cleaning or suctioning it.

21:35.469 --> 21:38.025
- What, neglect?
- No, I don't think so.

21:38.050 --> 21:41.041
All other areas, he was
meticulously well-cared for.

21:41.066 --> 21:42.761
His nails are trimmed,
his teeth are brushed,

21:42.786 --> 21:45.713
- skin is moisturized.
- So Mom's burnt out.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.604
The first thing to slip was the tube?

21:47.639 --> 21:49.205
Ever since Sam's injury,

21:49.241 --> 21:52.034
she has devoted her entire
life to caring for him.

21:52.059 --> 21:53.433
I'm not sure how to tell her

21:53.458 --> 21:55.774
that she may no longer
be up to the task.

21:55.799 --> 21:57.264
You want some backup?

21:57.289 --> 21:59.944
No, I don't want her
to feel ganged up on.

22:00.704 --> 22:02.571
I'll figure it out.

22:04.653 --> 22:06.286
Agh!

22:06.587 --> 22:08.554
So, the... the Zofran
hasn't helped at all?

22:08.579 --> 22:11.147
No! And the cramps are unbearable.

22:11.172 --> 22:12.638
- So is her gas.
- Hey!

22:12.663 --> 22:14.056
No fever, vitals are normal.

22:14.081 --> 22:16.684
All right, let's hang another
liter of, uh, normal saline,

22:16.709 --> 22:20.544
and order a CBC, CMP,
amylase, and lipase levels.

22:20.610 --> 22:21.670
Okay?

22:21.706 --> 22:24.438
Uh, this might be, uh, a stomach bug,

22:24.463 --> 22:25.899
- possibly kidney stones, okay?
- Oh...

22:25.924 --> 22:27.089
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna p...

22:27.114 --> 22:28.095
I'm gonna press on your stomach.

22:28.120 --> 22:30.471
- Ah! Wait, I need a bathroom!
- Okay.

22:30.496 --> 22:32.415
- Oh, okay.
- I need a bathroom right now!

22:32.440 --> 22:33.836
- All right, come on, honey.
- Okay, hold on a second.

22:33.861 --> 22:35.493
- We'll get you there.
- Ahh!

22:35.518 --> 22:37.017
Oh!

22:37.042 --> 22:39.111
- What?
- Whoa.

22:39.642 --> 22:42.712
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.118
Honey, let's get you back into bed.

22:44.143 --> 22:46.781
Oh, my God, no... I still need to go!

22:46.806 --> 22:48.829
- Okay, I'm gonna help you.
- Really bad!

22:48.854 --> 22:50.626
- Come on. Come on, let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no.

22:50.651 --> 22:52.583
That's not urine.

22:53.134 --> 22:55.690
Oh, okay. Let's... let's get
you right back into bed.

22:55.715 --> 22:56.774
- Come on.
- Wait, what... what's going on?

22:56.799 --> 22:57.946
I don't know what's happening.

22:57.971 --> 22:59.110
- Come on.
- What's going on?

22:59.135 --> 23:01.368
Oh! Oh! Ow!

23:01.393 --> 23:02.813
- Come on.
- Jeez.

23:04.629 --> 23:06.347
What are you doing?

23:06.372 --> 23:08.212
- What's going on?
- Oh.

23:08.237 --> 23:10.622
- Yikes!
- What is going on?

23:10.647 --> 23:12.899
- Really? Are you s... whoa!
- Oh.

23:12.924 --> 23:14.371
- Okay, Mrs. Davis...
- Yeah?

23:14.396 --> 23:16.470
You're gonna wanna push, but don't.

23:16.494 --> 23:18.429
There's no way. No, no, no.

23:18.454 --> 23:19.961
This... this is not possible.

23:19.986 --> 23:22.749
- Uh, what is going on?
- Your wife is pregnant...

23:22.774 --> 23:24.079
And in labor.

23:24.104 --> 23:26.548
No, no, that c... That can't be true.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.837
I'm 55; I've been through menopause.

23:28.862 --> 23:31.649
I know this might be a shock,
but this is happening.

23:31.674 --> 23:33.608
- I am positive. Page OB.
- Okay.

23:33.633 --> 23:35.407
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Uh...

23:35.432 --> 23:38.166
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my...

23:38.191 --> 23:40.125
What the hell, Connor?

23:40.150 --> 23:41.883
Not here.

23:44.482 --> 23:46.750
That motorcyclist is an HLA match

23:46.775 --> 23:48.241
to my patient, Peter,

23:48.266 --> 23:51.170
but suddenly, your GCM
patient is above him

23:51.195 --> 23:52.661
on the transplant list?

23:52.686 --> 23:55.214
How did he come in this
morning at Status Two

23:55.239 --> 23:58.040
and suddenly jump to
the highest priority?

23:58.065 --> 24:01.063
- I had to put him on ECMO.
- Before other meds?

24:01.159 --> 24:03.642
Milrinone? Monoclonal antibody therapy?

24:03.667 --> 24:05.235
They're just stop-gaps.

24:07.344 --> 24:10.036
Oh, you sneaky son of a bitch.

24:10.619 --> 24:12.797
ECMO trumps an artificial heart,

24:12.859 --> 24:15.017
puts your patient to
the top of the list.

24:15.205 --> 24:17.238
You manipulated the system.

24:17.263 --> 24:18.962
I made an aggressive treatment decision.

24:18.987 --> 24:21.397
You're taking a heart that
doesn't belong to you!

24:21.422 --> 24:24.493
I am fighting for one that's available!

24:24.518 --> 24:26.931
This isn't right...

24:27.583 --> 24:29.446
and it isn't over.

24:32.646 --> 24:35.281
The hospital can connect
you with respite services,

24:35.306 --> 24:37.739
as well as caregiver support groups.

24:37.775 --> 24:39.993
You do not have to do this alone.

24:40.018 --> 24:41.985
And we can help out more, Mom.

24:42.602 --> 24:44.318
Catherine...

24:44.750 --> 24:46.749
no one is blaming you.

24:47.072 --> 24:50.841
You have done a tremendous
job caring for Sam.

24:54.874 --> 24:57.024
I wasn't trying to hurt him.

24:57.049 --> 24:59.350
No, of course not.

24:59.375 --> 25:01.208
I thought that...

25:01.233 --> 25:04.211
he would go peacefully.

25:04.661 --> 25:08.454
Uh, I wasn't prepared
to see him in pain.

25:10.458 --> 25:12.625
Mom, what are you talking about?

25:12.872 --> 25:16.242
Sam doesn't want this oblivion.

25:17.941 --> 25:21.454
I see it in his eyes every
time he looks at me.

25:23.927 --> 25:27.649
The doctors say there is
no meaning behind it...

25:27.674 --> 25:31.516
...that... that he's not
really looking at me.

25:31.949 --> 25:34.116
I know my son...

25:36.374 --> 25:38.805
And he wants this over.

25:39.236 --> 25:42.304
- He was begging me to help him.
- Mom, stop talking.

25:42.329 --> 25:44.368
I should never have called 9-1-1.

25:44.594 --> 25:46.805
I should have just let
him go, like I planned,

25:46.830 --> 25:48.330
like he wanted.

25:48.355 --> 25:50.155
I got scared. I panicked.

25:50.180 --> 25:51.916
Oh, my God, Mom, did you...

25:51.941 --> 25:54.875
Mom, please, don't say anything else.

25:54.900 --> 25:57.133
Sam, I'm sorry I let you down.

25:57.532 --> 25:59.735
I am so sorry, honey.

26:01.432 --> 26:04.259
We need to call a lawyer, now.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.070
First, you're treating my father,

26:15.095 --> 26:17.362
and now you're blackmailing him?

26:17.662 --> 26:19.429
- What?
- You heard me.

26:19.454 --> 26:20.921
Look, I don't know what he told you...

26:20.946 --> 26:22.649
He said you're jealous
of our relationship,

26:22.674 --> 26:25.642
that you have some twisted
paternal feelings for me,

26:25.667 --> 26:27.203
that you threatened him,

26:27.228 --> 26:29.060
and said if he didn't stay away from me,

26:29.096 --> 26:31.135
you'd sabotage his chances
of getting on the list.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.253
I threatened him?

26:32.278 --> 26:33.906
- Wh... sabotage?
- Yes.

26:33.931 --> 26:36.167
I'm a shrink in a sweater
vest, not a secret agent.

26:36.192 --> 26:37.230
Is it true?

26:37.255 --> 26:39.409
I can't disclose details
of our conversation,

26:39.434 --> 26:42.548
but I assure you, all I
did was lay out the facts

26:42.573 --> 26:43.966
as they pertain to his condition.

26:43.991 --> 26:45.355
What are you treating him for?

26:45.380 --> 26:46.535
I can't tell you that, Sarah.

26:46.560 --> 26:47.925
- He's my patient.
- But he is my father.

26:47.950 --> 26:50.081
Who suddenly reappears after two decades

26:50.106 --> 26:51.989
of avoiding parental responsibility

26:52.014 --> 26:54.011
and alienating everyone in his life,

26:54.036 --> 26:55.535
who now presents himself as a victim

26:55.560 --> 26:57.949
in order to create an alliance with you.

26:58.197 --> 26:59.923
Think about what you know, Sarah.

26:59.948 --> 27:01.132
If he was your patient,

27:01.157 --> 27:02.943
what would be on your differential?

27:11.765 --> 27:13.397
What was that about?

27:13.422 --> 27:15.126
As you will read in my evaluation,

27:15.151 --> 27:16.616
her father, Dr. Haywood,

27:16.641 --> 27:18.548
has a particularly malignant form

27:18.573 --> 27:20.503
of Antisocial Personality Disorder.

27:20.528 --> 27:23.939
Are you serious? Is she in danger?

27:23.964 --> 27:26.097
Well, I haven't picked up
any violent tendencies yet,

27:26.122 --> 27:28.550
but he's an extremely
effective manipulator.

27:28.672 --> 27:30.493
Dr. Reese doesn't know?

27:30.518 --> 27:32.697
Well, I think she might be
starting to figure it out

27:32.722 --> 27:35.729
on a clinical level, but emotionally,

27:36.059 --> 27:38.034
she's... she's not there yet.

27:40.453 --> 27:42.425
Ahh!

27:42.495 --> 27:45.713
Oh! This can't be real!
This can't be real!

27:45.738 --> 27:47.778
- Where the hell is the OB?
- They said five minutes.

27:47.803 --> 27:48.902
We can't wait. The baby's crowning.

27:48.927 --> 27:49.778
- What?
- Tessa...

27:49.803 --> 27:51.169
- Yeah?
- On three,

27:51.194 --> 27:52.270
- really big push, okay?
- Okay.

27:52.295 --> 27:53.758
- All right, one...
- Uh-huh?

27:53.783 --> 27:55.283
Two, three.

27:59.104 --> 28:00.933
Yeah, good, good.

28:00.958 --> 28:02.738
When did we go to Mark
and Patti's cabin?

28:02.763 --> 28:04.379
- What?
- Was that Fourth of July?

28:04.404 --> 28:05.550
What are you talking about?

28:05.575 --> 28:07.403
I'm just trying to figure
out when this happened.

28:07.428 --> 28:10.301
Oh, God, Greg, how does that matter now?

28:10.326 --> 28:11.852
Mr. Davis, can you please help the nurse

28:11.877 --> 28:13.246
hold your wife's leg back?

28:13.271 --> 28:14.660
- All right, okay, yeah, yeah.
- Thank you. Okay.

28:14.685 --> 28:15.715
Tessa, Tessa, look at me.
Look at me, Tessa.

28:15.740 --> 28:17.090
Okay, Tessa, one more push, all right?

28:17.115 --> 28:18.114
- Okay.
- You can do it, you can do it.

28:18.139 --> 28:19.905
- Yeah!
- You can do it.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.332
- Ready?
- Yeah!

28:21.356 --> 28:23.346
Go.

28:23.371 --> 28:25.653
You're doing great. You're almost there.

28:25.678 --> 28:27.896
- All right, all right.
- Yes.

28:27.921 --> 28:29.121
- ...Oh!
- Whoa.

28:29.146 --> 28:31.212
Okay, okay...

28:31.237 --> 28:33.035
This is crazy.

28:33.060 --> 28:35.738
- Does he look okay?
- Oh, my...

28:35.763 --> 28:38.196
- It's a girl. Congratulations.
- Oh!

28:38.221 --> 28:40.096
- Oh...
- Congratulations to you both.

28:40.121 --> 28:42.554
Oh, my goodness.

28:42.589 --> 28:44.855
Oh, my gosh.

28:48.366 --> 28:50.386
Natalie, you can't sit on this.

28:50.411 --> 28:51.465
If I report it,

28:51.490 --> 28:54.121
Catherine will likely be
removed as Sam's guardian.

28:54.146 --> 28:56.279
I wanna pull in social services.

28:56.304 --> 28:58.449
This goes beyond family counseling.

28:58.474 --> 29:00.307
It's a criminal matter.

29:03.148 --> 29:06.394
She intentionally stopped trach
care to cause her son's death.

29:06.419 --> 29:08.473
To end his suffering.

29:08.498 --> 29:10.293
You know, she looked
into moving to a state

29:10.318 --> 29:12.090
where assisted suicide is legal?

29:12.115 --> 29:14.285
But because Sam isn't terminal ill

29:14.310 --> 29:16.004
and can't express his
wishes, he didn't qualify.

29:16.029 --> 29:17.621
Exactly, which means
you can't be certain

29:17.646 --> 29:19.059
this is what he wants.

29:19.084 --> 29:22.328
No one knows what Sam wants
more than his mother.

29:22.353 --> 29:24.352
Then she needs to go to
court and make her case,

29:24.377 --> 29:26.440
petition a judge to get
his feeding tube removed.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.965
Look, Natalie, I'm not
arguing she's wrong,

29:28.990 --> 29:30.761
but what she did is illegal.

29:33.358 --> 29:34.863
You have to call the police.

29:34.888 --> 29:36.446
No.

29:37.316 --> 29:38.769
Then I will.

29:43.739 --> 29:47.306
Decerebrate posturing:
rigid limbs, pointed toes.

29:48.407 --> 29:50.782
She's slipping deeper
into unconsciousness.

29:50.807 --> 29:53.925
Dr. Stohl, Dr. Choi, we got something.

29:57.866 --> 29:59.853
Right after we discovered Rachel,

29:59.878 --> 30:02.457
I texted a pic of her license
throughout the hospital.

30:02.482 --> 30:04.681
I just got a call from
my friend from HR.

30:04.706 --> 30:06.683
She said she interviewed
Rachel this morning

30:06.708 --> 30:08.008
for an admin job.

30:08.033 --> 30:10.441
She said she was alert and engaging.

30:11.455 --> 30:13.644
Alert and engaging?

30:14.829 --> 30:16.901
That doesn't sound like
someone about to OD.

30:16.926 --> 30:18.278
All right, but if it's not drugs,

30:18.303 --> 30:19.936
- what the hell knocked her out?
- You missed something.

30:19.961 --> 30:21.231
Recheck every test result,

30:21.256 --> 30:24.254
look for anything that might
be mimicking something else.

30:25.019 --> 30:26.747
Her MRI.

30:29.265 --> 30:31.459
These two spots of
diffusion restriction,

30:31.484 --> 30:34.025
radiology says they're from
movement and mental artifact.

30:34.050 --> 30:36.517
The plate in her cheek.
But what if that's wrong?

30:36.666 --> 30:38.517
This could be damage from a stroke,

30:38.542 --> 30:41.493
a clot that's knocked out the
Reticular Activating System.

30:41.518 --> 30:43.151
- I don't...
- Look, RES controls

30:43.176 --> 30:44.382
wake and sleep patterns.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.766
Easy, Quincy, that would
take a huge clot.

30:46.791 --> 30:48.791
The damage would be far
more extensive than this.

30:48.826 --> 30:51.126
Normally, yes, because most
people have two vessels

30:51.151 --> 30:52.684
that provide blood flow to the area,

30:52.709 --> 30:55.134
- but some only have one.
- The Artery of Percheron.

30:55.159 --> 30:56.525
If Rachel has this variant,

30:56.550 --> 30:58.377
a small clot in just the right area

30:58.402 --> 30:59.580
would take out the RAS.

30:59.605 --> 31:01.720
She's been out for about 4 1/2 hours.

31:01.745 --> 31:04.207
We missed the window to
use tPA to bust the clot.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.773
Still may be able to reverse the damage

31:05.809 --> 31:08.494
- with local thrombolysis.
- Okay, so get on it.

31:10.601 --> 31:12.861
This is not a debate, Dr. Rhodes.

31:12.886 --> 31:16.728
My patient's HLA is an
ideal match to the donor.

31:16.753 --> 31:19.314
But his antibody levels are not.

31:19.355 --> 31:22.579
They're too high and suggest
he'll reject the heart.

31:22.604 --> 31:26.454
So it slides to the next
person on the transplant list,

31:26.479 --> 31:28.609
Dr. Bekker's, patient, Peter.

31:29.020 --> 31:30.423
I'm sorry.

31:35.785 --> 31:38.316
Without that heart, Dan
doesn't stand a chance.

31:38.341 --> 31:40.941
- Neither does Peter.
- No, actually, he does,

31:40.966 --> 31:43.000
because the artificial
heart that you put in

31:43.025 --> 31:45.158
can last months, possibly even years.

31:45.183 --> 31:47.216
Dan doesn't have that kinda time.

31:47.241 --> 31:48.760
Peter, he's had two hearts already,

31:48.785 --> 31:49.994
and with each transplant,

31:50.019 --> 31:52.620
his chances of survival decrease.

31:52.645 --> 31:54.865
It is not fair that
he gets a third heart

31:54.890 --> 31:56.289
before Dan even gets his first.

31:56.325 --> 31:58.268
There's no limit to the number of organs

31:58.293 --> 31:59.949
a person can receive,

32:00.308 --> 32:02.432
and it's impossible to
compare patients in need.

32:02.457 --> 32:03.978
That's why there's a list,

32:04.003 --> 32:06.426
to crunch numbers and break ties.

32:09.732 --> 32:11.679
You're right.

32:11.959 --> 32:13.394
It's all about the numbers.

32:19.779 --> 32:21.227
Okay.

32:21.252 --> 32:23.651
No, no, right, uh, I understand.

32:24.036 --> 32:25.738
Okay, bye.

32:26.513 --> 32:28.207
I canceled our trip.

32:28.362 --> 32:30.894
They asked if I wanted to
rebook for a later date.

32:30.919 --> 32:32.980
I said, "Sure, in about 18 years."

32:33.005 --> 32:34.004
Uh, what's that saying?

32:34.029 --> 32:35.888
"When we plan, God laughs"?

32:35.913 --> 32:38.467
Speaking of planning, we need diapers

32:38.492 --> 32:40.258
and a crib and a car seat

32:40.294 --> 32:42.093
and bottles and, uh, onesies

32:42.129 --> 32:44.129
and... and... and did I say diapers?

32:44.154 --> 32:46.285
- You did.
- I ate sushi.

32:46.310 --> 32:48.457
I had the occasional glass of wine.

32:48.482 --> 32:50.512
I am happy to report

32:50.537 --> 32:53.503
that you have a completely
healthy baby girl.

32:53.528 --> 32:54.832
Really?

32:54.857 --> 32:56.353
Aw.

32:56.625 --> 32:58.859
- Amazing.
- Hey, you. Yes!

32:58.884 --> 33:00.965
- Hello! God!
- Oh.

33:00.990 --> 33:02.366
Oh, holy cow, you weren't kidding.

33:02.391 --> 33:04.893
- No.
- This is our son, Martin,

33:04.918 --> 33:07.738
and our daughter-in-law,
Amy, and Haley, come here

33:07.763 --> 33:10.656
and meet your, um... aunt.

33:10.843 --> 33:12.441
How 'bout that, huh?

33:12.548 --> 33:14.113
We'll give you all some time.

33:14.138 --> 33:16.230
- Thanks.
- Thanks very much.

33:16.816 --> 33:19.880
- I'll let you...
- Right this way, guys.

33:24.861 --> 33:26.963
It's weird that Will was so adamant

33:26.988 --> 33:29.425
about calling the cops.

33:29.474 --> 33:30.717
What do you mean?

33:30.742 --> 33:33.324
Well, last week's patient, Vic Thomas,

33:33.349 --> 33:36.392
he had advanced-stage cancer,
and he was refusing treatment.

33:36.442 --> 33:38.826
Will sent me out of the
room to get a cautery,

33:38.851 --> 33:40.988
and when I came back, Vic was dead.

33:41.013 --> 33:44.292
I can't be certain, but I
think Will let him die.

33:52.134 --> 33:54.450
What did you do?

33:54.684 --> 33:57.262
Oh, my God. He's not hooked up.

33:57.287 --> 33:58.644
I need some help here!

33:58.669 --> 34:00.332
Ma'am, I need you to step out.

34:00.357 --> 34:02.336
Right now, ma'am!

34:02.543 --> 34:05.212
- I love you, Sam.
- Ma'am, please.

34:05.525 --> 34:07.091
No pulse. Bag him.

34:07.116 --> 34:08.581
I need you to step back
from here, please.

34:08.607 --> 34:10.159
Step back, please.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.309
Quick look?

34:17.485 --> 34:20.119
- Asystole.
- Milligram of epi.

34:30.121 --> 34:32.047
- Still no pulse.
- Another milligram of epi.

34:32.072 --> 34:34.790
Please, don't hurt him.

34:35.659 --> 34:38.469
Just let him go.

34:56.327 --> 34:58.261
Time of death, 18:16.

35:14.884 --> 35:16.939
It did not have to get this messy.

35:16.964 --> 35:18.173
I had no choice, Natalie.

35:18.198 --> 35:20.476
When someone commits a crime,
you have to report it.

35:20.501 --> 35:21.934
Except from when it's you?

35:21.970 --> 35:24.305
- What are you talking about?
- Vic Thomas.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.196
You let him die.

35:26.232 --> 35:28.626
That's why you've been walking
around like a ghost, right?

35:31.403 --> 35:33.237
I don't know what April told you,

35:33.272 --> 35:36.156
but Vic Thomas explicitly and repeatedly

35:36.181 --> 35:37.907
expressed his wishes to me,

35:37.932 --> 35:40.499
and there is a monumental
difference between

35:40.524 --> 35:42.229
allowing someone to die naturally

35:42.261 --> 35:43.681
and intentionally causing their death.

35:43.706 --> 35:44.689
Well, if you did nothing wrong,

35:44.714 --> 35:46.064
then why keep it a secret?

35:46.089 --> 35:48.263
No, no, no, don't you
dare compare what I did

35:48.288 --> 35:49.540
to what happened here today.

35:49.565 --> 35:51.461
Natalie, they murdered him.

35:51.486 --> 35:54.095
You backed them into a corner
when you called the police.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.324
You forced that family into a decision!

36:00.179 --> 36:02.732
These are the results
of Dan Kennet's latest

36:02.757 --> 36:04.705
panel reactive antibody test.

36:04.730 --> 36:07.431
His antibody levels were
above 80, but now...

36:07.456 --> 36:09.431
They're within transplant criteria.

36:09.456 --> 36:11.751
Antibody levels don't just go
down on their own that quickly.

36:11.776 --> 36:15.072
Uh, you can see for yourself.
I had the lab run it twice.

36:19.528 --> 36:21.767
I'm sorry, Dr. Bekker.

36:21.792 --> 36:22.957
It's not my decision.

36:22.982 --> 36:25.369
Dan Kennet is at the top of the list.

36:25.394 --> 36:27.160
Assemble the transplant team,

36:27.185 --> 36:30.431
and notify Mr. Kennet and his family.

36:32.316 --> 36:34.777
Emergency plasmapheresis and IVIG.

36:35.429 --> 36:37.366
Didn't you?

36:38.130 --> 36:41.618
You made Dan look like a better
candidate than he really is.

36:41.782 --> 36:43.994
Soon as he's off the
plasmapheresis and IVIG,

36:44.019 --> 36:45.736
his antibody levels will shoot back up.

36:45.761 --> 36:47.213
Maybe, but the immunosuppressants

36:47.238 --> 36:48.595
that he's gonna be on post-transplant

36:48.620 --> 36:50.925
should ensure that his body
doesn't reject the organ.

36:50.950 --> 36:53.149
- You got it all covered, huh?
- Hey, look,

36:53.174 --> 36:55.202
I did what I had to for my patient.

36:55.227 --> 36:57.978
At the expense of mine!
So do me a favor, okay,

36:58.003 --> 37:00.971
and save your self-righteous
hero speech for someone else.

37:15.139 --> 37:17.439
- Will she wake up?
- I'm hopeful.

37:17.464 --> 37:18.634
Interventional radiology

37:18.659 --> 37:20.725
was able to locate the
clot and clear it.

37:20.954 --> 37:23.555
But she's so young.
What caused the stroke?

37:23.580 --> 37:25.953
Deep vein blood clot.

37:26.024 --> 37:27.664
Cigarettes and birth control pills

37:27.689 --> 37:29.283
were found in Rachel's purse.

37:29.308 --> 37:31.220
Smoking on the pill can
sometimes cause one.

37:31.245 --> 37:33.142
But how'd it get into her brain?

37:33.210 --> 37:36.512
A PFO, a hole in the heart.

37:36.570 --> 37:37.869
They're not uncommon.

37:37.894 --> 37:40.137
Most people don't even
know they have them.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.424
Jacob?

37:42.475 --> 37:45.477
Oh, thank God, Rachel.

37:45.977 --> 37:48.696
- Where am I?
- The hospital.

37:48.721 --> 37:52.056
Rachel... I'm Dr. Choi.

37:52.216 --> 37:53.983
Do you know what day it is?

37:55.675 --> 37:57.484
Tuesday.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.991
What's the last thing you remember?

38:00.870 --> 38:02.990
I sat down...

38:03.272 --> 38:05.439
to wait for my cab.

38:05.622 --> 38:07.554
I had a job interview.

38:07.579 --> 38:09.212
The nurse told me.

38:09.237 --> 38:12.002
That's where you've been going
in the afternoons, isn't it?

38:12.184 --> 38:13.845
Looking for a job?

38:14.044 --> 38:15.911
Why didn't you tell me?

38:15.999 --> 38:18.508
I've messed up so many times before.

38:18.533 --> 38:22.368
To surprise you, show you
that I really changed.

38:22.612 --> 38:25.009
So, it's really gonna happen today?

38:25.034 --> 38:26.567
Yes.

38:26.592 --> 38:28.959
You are getting a new heart.

38:31.018 --> 38:34.438
Uh... my antibody levels,

38:34.463 --> 38:36.657
like, I thought they were too high.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.649
They were, but now they're not.

38:38.847 --> 38:42.235
The emergency plasmapheresis
and IVIG you're on now

38:42.260 --> 38:45.227
lowered your levels to
within transplant criteria.

38:45.252 --> 38:48.251
Techs are gonna be by to
prep you for surgery soon.

38:50.323 --> 38:52.792
Thank you, Dr. Rhodes.

38:54.513 --> 38:56.628
Of course.

38:56.984 --> 38:58.881
Thank you.

39:21.465 --> 39:23.531
It's all just legal mumbo jumbo.

39:27.886 --> 39:29.995
It's pretty boilerplate.

39:31.922 --> 39:33.543
Ah...

39:34.041 --> 39:35.407
Here.

39:42.358 --> 39:45.677
Um, Dad, I'm sorry, but I...
I... I can't sign this.

39:58.641 --> 40:01.313
Yeah! Muah.

40:01.651 --> 40:04.517
Yeah!

40:08.976 --> 40:10.411
Yeah!

40:20.828 --> 40:22.629
Just some friends and family?

40:22.654 --> 40:25.239
You look so good in a suit.

40:25.264 --> 40:27.499
I cannot wait to tear it off later.

40:27.524 --> 40:30.221
April, this is my sister, Emily.

40:30.542 --> 40:33.741
Emily, my girlfriend, April.

40:33.766 --> 40:35.165
It's all good.

40:35.190 --> 40:37.960
I am so happy to finally meet you.

40:37.985 --> 40:39.811
Prazer em conhecê.

40:39.836 --> 40:42.835
Oh, get... Você falar Português?

40:42.860 --> 40:44.735
A little. I spent a year in Rio.

40:44.760 --> 40:47.585
Wow...

40:47.610 --> 40:49.076
Well, hello there.

40:49.202 --> 40:51.903
I am Noah. And you are?

40:51.928 --> 40:53.789
Emily.

40:53.814 --> 40:56.047
- Emily.
- Ethan's sister.

40:56.072 --> 40:57.678
Right.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.754
Oh, really?

40:59.779 --> 41:02.346
Really? Well, you know, how about that?

41:02.371 --> 41:04.905
Yeah? You wanna join
me on the dance floor?

41:04.930 --> 41:06.796
Sure. Think you can keep up?

41:06.863 --> 41:08.262
Oh, yeah?

41:08.287 --> 41:09.637
Oh, it's on. Vamos lá.

41:09.662 --> 41:12.097
Aww!

41:12.962 --> 41:15.038
Aww, she seems fun.

41:15.063 --> 41:17.101
I'm so glad you brought her.

41:17.891 --> 41:20.859
With Emily, I always
expect to be disappointed.

41:21.234 --> 41:23.985
Thought I'd give her a
chance to prove me wrong.

41:24.702 --> 41:25.984
But you...

41:26.759 --> 41:28.323
breathtaking.

41:28.348 --> 41:30.159
Come on, join me on the dance floor.

41:30.184 --> 41:31.660
- No.
- Yes!

41:31.685 --> 41:33.405
- No!
- Hey!

41:33.430 --> 41:35.194
No...

41:35.523 --> 41:37.787
And then faster.

41:37.812 --> 41:39.582
One, two, one, two.
