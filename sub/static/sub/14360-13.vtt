WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.129
Dewey!

00:04.171 --> 00:05.339
Come on out, honey!

00:05.380 --> 00:06.841
How did he find out

00:05.380 --> 00:06.841
he was going

00:06.882 --> 00:07.967
to the doctor

00:06.882 --> 00:07.967
this morning?

00:08.008 --> 00:10.093
Well, I certainly

00:08.008 --> 00:10.093
didn't say anything.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.721
Dewey!

00:12.763 --> 00:14.014
Son?

00:14.932 --> 00:17.058
(echoes):

00:14.932 --> 00:17.058
Dewey!

00:17.100 --> 00:19.060
Dewey, come on out!

00:19.102 --> 00:20.855
We love you, son!

00:20.896 --> 00:23.064
Dewey, come on, we're

00:20.896 --> 00:23.064
going to be late.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.235
(slow, steady breathing)

00:30.113 --> 00:34.117
Oh... poor

00:30.113 --> 00:34.117
little thing.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.077

Awesome dinner, Mom.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.534
Those are the

01:14.157 --> 01:15.534
best fish sticks

01:15.576 --> 01:16.952
I've had in my

01:15.576 --> 01:16.952
entire life.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.829
Seriously, I don't

01:16.994 --> 01:18.829
know how you do it.

01:18.871 --> 01:19.997
The microwave.

01:20.039 --> 01:21.331
But for the perfect

01:20.039 --> 01:21.331
amount of time.

01:21.373 --> 01:23.042
Well, I better

01:21.373 --> 01:23.042
clear my plate

01:23.083 --> 01:24.501
and get started

01:23.083 --> 01:24.501
on my homework.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.628
At first, I thought

01:24.543 --> 01:26.628
it was a brain tumor,

01:26.670 --> 01:28.129
but tomorrow,

01:26.670 --> 01:28.129
he's old enough

01:28.171 --> 01:29.631
to get

01:28.171 --> 01:29.631
his learner's permit.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.050
He's on his

01:29.673 --> 01:31.050
best behavior

01:31.090 --> 01:32.509
until after

01:31.090 --> 01:32.509
he passes the test.

01:32.551 --> 01:35.136
Can I get anyone a nice cup

01:32.551 --> 01:35.136
of peppermint tea?

01:35.178 --> 01:36.388
Helps digestion.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.973
Mom and Dad

01:36.430 --> 01:37.973
have been looking

01:38.015 --> 01:39.391
for any excuse

01:38.015 --> 01:39.391
to ground him,

01:39.433 --> 01:41.060
but he hasn't

01:39.433 --> 01:41.060
screwed up once

01:41.100 --> 01:42.143
in, like, three weeks.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.145
It's actually

01:42.185 --> 01:44.145
getting kind of boring.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.355
Ow!

01:48.650 --> 01:51.862
Didn't think so.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.822
Remember, Dad,

01:51.904 --> 01:53.822
you're picking me up

01:53.864 --> 01:55.741
from school tomorrow

01:53.864 --> 01:55.741
to take me to the DMV.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.451
I wouldn't miss it, son.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.160
Dear God, what are we

01:57.492 --> 01:59.160
going to do?

01:59.202 --> 02:00.079
What can we do?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.039
He hasn't done

02:00.120 --> 02:02.039
anything wrong.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.082
Oh, please, it's Reese.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.625
We just haven't

02:03.123 --> 02:04.625
looked hard enough.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.209
Hal, we're going

02:04.666 --> 02:06.209
to have to face it.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.753
That kid is going

02:06.251 --> 02:07.753
to be mobile.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.463
Reese surrounded by

02:07.795 --> 02:09.463
6,000 pounds of steel

02:09.504 --> 02:11.840
and 20 gallons

02:09.504 --> 02:11.840
of explosive fuel.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.175
It's like giving a shark

02:11.882 --> 02:14.175
a submachine gun.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.176
(phone ringing)

02:15.218 --> 02:16.219
I'll get it.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.346
Hello.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.765
Hey, Dad.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.016
Francis, hi,

02:19.807 --> 02:21.016
how are you?

02:21.058 --> 02:22.851
We haven't heard

02:21.058 --> 02:22.851
from you in so long.

02:22.893 --> 02:23.978
Yeah, well,

02:24.019 --> 02:25.854
you know how I've always

02:24.019 --> 02:25.854
been kind of impulsive

02:25.896 --> 02:28.565
and independent-minded,

02:25.896 --> 02:28.565
but basically

02:28.607 --> 02:29.566
just unlucky?

02:29.608 --> 02:30.734
What?

02:30.776 --> 02:32.193
Well, there's been

02:30.776 --> 02:32.193
a certain incident here,

02:32.235 --> 02:34.404
and without getting

02:32.235 --> 02:34.404
bogged down by the blame game,

02:34.446 --> 02:36.364
let's just say

02:34.446 --> 02:36.364
there have been some damages.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.699
That's why

02:36.406 --> 02:37.699
you're calling?

02:37.741 --> 02:39.910
Francis, no, you can't

02:37.741 --> 02:39.910
do that anymore.

02:39.952 --> 02:40.911
You're on your own.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.913
You've emancipated

02:40.953 --> 02:42.913
yourself, remember?

02:42.955 --> 02:45.791
You can't come running

02:42.955 --> 02:45.791
back to your parents for money

02:45.833 --> 02:47.668
at the first sign

02:45.833 --> 02:47.668
of trouble anymore.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.210
I'm not running to my parents.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.296
I'm calling

02:49.252 --> 02:51.296
as one adult to another

02:51.338 --> 02:53.674
for an adult... loan.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.010
No. No, you've made

02:53.715 --> 02:56.010
whatever mess you've made

02:56.051 --> 02:57.218
and you take care of it.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.512
I have been taking care of it.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.597
I already got Big Red

02:58.553 --> 03:00.597
to cut me the lumber

03:00.639 --> 03:02.641
in exchange for a pair

03:00.639 --> 03:02.641
of fur-lined boots.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.434
I got my friend Pete

03:02.683 --> 03:04.434
to make the boots

03:04.476 --> 03:05.811
but only because

03:04.476 --> 03:05.811
I promised him

03:05.853 --> 03:07.104
a new set of teeth

03:07.146 --> 03:09.230
and, as you probably know,

03:07.146 --> 03:09.230
teeth don't come cheap

03:09.272 --> 03:10.941
and that's where you...

03:10.983 --> 03:14.820
Hey, Dave, you know

03:10.983 --> 03:14.820
that digital camera

03:14.862 --> 03:17.072
that Bernie got that

03:14.862 --> 03:17.072
you like so much?

03:17.114 --> 03:18.239
Yeah?

03:18.281 --> 03:19.741
Well, what

03:18.281 --> 03:19.741
would you pay

03:19.783 --> 03:21.242
if I could

03:19.783 --> 03:21.242
get it for you?

03:21.284 --> 03:24.079
You can get Bernie

03:21.284 --> 03:24.079
to give up his camera?

03:24.121 --> 03:26.247
Absolutely.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.834
I've been waiting for this

03:26.289 --> 03:28.834
my whole life.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.086
Once I'm driving,

03:28.876 --> 03:31.086
everything changes.

03:31.128 --> 03:34.756
All I have to do is stay out

03:31.128 --> 03:34.756
of trouble for the next 16 hours

03:34.798 --> 03:36.175
and I'm home free.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.258
How's that?

03:37.300 --> 03:40.679
A little tighter

03:37.300 --> 03:40.679
on this side.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.264
Okay, you're all set.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.684
Now, remember, do not

03:43.306 --> 03:45.684
untie me until the morning,

03:45.726 --> 03:47.978
no matter what I say

03:45.726 --> 03:47.978
or how much I beg.

03:48.020 --> 03:48.937
Got it.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.313
Uh-oh. I got to go

03:48.979 --> 03:50.313
to the bathroom.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.272
Too bad.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.273
Just testing.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.567
Thanks, buddy.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.196
It's weird, but Reese

03:54.902 --> 03:57.196
suddenly doesn't seem

03:57.237 --> 03:58.697
as irritating as he used to.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.741
It's amazing

03:58.739 --> 04:00.741
what a driver's license

04:00.782 --> 04:02.409
can do for a relationship.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.750
Hi.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.376
Dewey, I am warning you.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.003
If you even touch me,

04:13.045 --> 04:14.963
you can forget about me

04:13.045 --> 04:14.963
ever driving you anywhere

04:15.005 --> 04:16.548
for the rest of your life.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.926
I have nowhere to go.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.513
(phone ringing)

04:23.555 --> 04:24.890
Hello.

04:24.932 --> 04:25.807
Hi, Lois, it's Craig.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.475
Craig, I can't talk right now.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.727
I'm on the other line.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.021
It's okay, this will

04:28.769 --> 04:31.021
only take a second.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.606
I have something to say to you

04:32.647 --> 04:34.608
that I only

04:32.647 --> 04:34.608
feel comfortable saying

04:34.649 --> 04:36.193
because we're like family.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.319
Your son Malcolm

04:36.235 --> 04:38.319
is a filthy vandal.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.738
What?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.531
He threw eggs all over

04:39.780 --> 04:41.531
the front of my new apartment--

04:41.573 --> 04:43.324
him and his little

04:41.573 --> 04:43.324
wheelchair friend.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.326
They wanted some free

04:43.366 --> 04:45.326
Lucky Aide candy.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.122
I said no. The next thing I

04:45.368 --> 04:48.122
know, it's like D-Day here.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.415
Malcolm! Get in here!

04:50.457 --> 04:52.333
You'd think I'd be the

04:50.457 --> 04:52.333
last person he'd target

04:52.375 --> 04:54.628
after I forgave your family

04:52.375 --> 04:54.628
for burning my old place down,

04:54.669 --> 04:57.923
which, I'd like to remind you

04:54.669 --> 04:57.923
again, I hardly ever mention.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.008
Craig, I am so sorry.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.509
Well, boys will be boys.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.720
All I want is for him

05:01.551 --> 05:03.720
to come over and clean it up,

05:03.762 --> 05:06.848
and if he could stop and get me

05:03.762 --> 05:06.848
a nonfat latte along the way

05:06.890 --> 05:08.267
that would be great.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.977
Don't worry, he's on his way.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.352
What is the matter with you?!

05:11.394 --> 05:13.438
Throwing eggs

05:11.394 --> 05:13.438
at Craig's front door?

05:13.480 --> 05:15.190
What are you

05:13.480 --> 05:15.190
talking about?

05:15.232 --> 05:16.357
I did it. I did it.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.651
You passed the test?

05:17.692 --> 05:18.777
I aced it.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.361
You got five wrong.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.990
Yeah, but I got 11 right,

05:20.403 --> 05:22.990
and that's good enough

05:23.031 --> 05:24.283
for my learner's permit.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.826
Man, if the DMV was

05:24.324 --> 05:25.826
running my school,

05:25.867 --> 05:27.077
I'd be, like, a

05:25.867 --> 05:27.077
"C" student.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.370
Well, congratulations.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.372
Dad, you sent that check

05:29.412 --> 05:31.372
to the driving school, right?

05:31.414 --> 05:32.373
Yes, Reese.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.374
You're sure you

05:32.415 --> 05:33.374
signed it.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.751
It's not going to

05:33.416 --> 05:34.751
bounce or anything?

05:34.793 --> 05:36.211
Everything is fine, Reese.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.797
Just go there straight

05:36.253 --> 05:38.797
after school tomorrow.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.381
You guys are the best.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.634
I promise when you're old

05:40.423 --> 05:42.634
and crazy,

05:42.676 --> 05:44.385
I'll drive to the

05:42.676 --> 05:44.385
home and visit you.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.887
Maybe we could go for

05:44.427 --> 05:45.887
a drive around the park.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.388
Would you like that?

05:47.430 --> 05:49.016
I can't wait.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.393
Why are you still here?

05:52.435 --> 05:53.603
Get over to Craig's.

05:53.645 --> 05:54.646
Start cleaning.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.772
Mom, I didn't

05:54.688 --> 05:55.772
throw anything

05:55.814 --> 05:57.191
at his front door,

05:55.814 --> 05:57.191
I swear.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.775
Malcolm, why would

05:57.232 --> 05:58.775
a grown man lie

05:58.817 --> 06:00.068
about something like that?

06:00.110 --> 06:02.070
I lied because

06:00.110 --> 06:02.070
I needed your help.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.990
I finally got

06:02.112 --> 06:04.990
my insurance settlement.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.994
This receiver works

06:05.032 --> 06:08.994
in both SRS 5.1 and DTS.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.413
Unidirectional subwoofer

06:09.036 --> 06:12.413
for surround sound.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.582
Progressive-scan DVD player.

06:14.624 --> 06:19.129
Plays both AIFF and MP3 formats

06:14.624 --> 06:19.129
on either CDs or CD-Rs.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.797
I figured

06:19.171 --> 06:20.797
you'd be comfortable

06:20.839 --> 06:22.423
with this level

06:20.839 --> 06:22.423
of electronics.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.051
I mean,

06:22.465 --> 06:24.051
the guys at the store

06:24.092 --> 06:25.635
couldn't find

06:24.092 --> 06:25.635
their graphic equalizers

06:25.677 --> 06:27.137
with two hands

06:25.677 --> 06:27.137
and a flashlight.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.223
You dragged me over here

06:27.179 --> 06:29.223
to hook up your stereo?

06:29.264 --> 06:31.432
Can't you get one

06:29.264 --> 06:31.432
of your friends to

06:29.264 --> 06:31.432
help you do this?

06:31.474 --> 06:33.518
(purring)

06:33.560 --> 06:37.147
And tick off the other

06:33.560 --> 06:37.147
friends I didn't ask?

06:37.189 --> 06:40.608
Malcolm, this goes

06:37.189 --> 06:40.608
far beyond just a stereo.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.152
This is going to be

06:42.194 --> 06:45.364
the greatest

06:42.194 --> 06:45.364
entertainment center ever.

06:45.404 --> 06:47.699
Have you ever wanted

06:45.404 --> 06:47.699
to be the best at something?

06:47.741 --> 06:51.036
Not just good,

06:47.741 --> 06:51.036
I don't mean great,

06:51.078 --> 06:53.330
I mean the absolute best?

06:53.372 --> 06:54.455
I don't know.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.665
Well, I have.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.459
Ever since I was a kid

06:55.707 --> 06:58.459
watching  Land of the Lost

06:58.501 --> 07:01.338
on my tiny

06:58.501 --> 07:01.338
black-and-white six-inch,

07:01.380 --> 07:02.839
I knew there'd be a day...

07:02.881 --> 07:06.260
a day when I could create

07:02.881 --> 07:06.260
my own high-def universe...

07:06.301 --> 07:09.470
a magical realm

07:06.301 --> 07:09.470
where fantasy and technology

07:09.512 --> 07:11.472
intersect at my every whim

07:11.514 --> 07:13.308
because I am the king.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.642
So your lifelong dream

07:14.684 --> 07:17.478
was to become the

07:14.684 --> 07:17.478
world's best TV watcher?

07:17.520 --> 07:18.897
Yeah.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.233
I'm in.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.280
I still can't believe it.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.906
For the first time ever,

07:26.321 --> 07:27.906
I'm going to be...

07:27.948 --> 07:30.367
behind the wheel.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.411
He keeps doing that.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.495
Mom, I have to go

07:32.452 --> 07:34.495
to Craig's today after school.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.705
You still have

07:34.537 --> 07:35.705
more to clean up?

07:35.747 --> 07:38.208
Yeah, I made a hell of a mess.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.667
Hey, Dewey, I

07:38.250 --> 07:39.667
want you to know

07:39.709 --> 07:40.877
there's no

07:39.709 --> 07:40.877
hard feelings

07:40.919 --> 07:43.004
about the last

07:40.919 --> 07:43.004
couple of weeks.

07:43.046 --> 07:45.715
Because you're going

07:43.046 --> 07:45.715
to suffer every day

07:45.757 --> 07:48.635
for the next ten years.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.516
Yep, brand-new.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.227
College boy got

07:55.558 --> 07:57.227
'em for me.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.479
Warm, are they?

07:57.269 --> 07:59.479
Oh, yeah.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.568
Oh, this is awesome.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.237
Willie's grandson is

08:05.610 --> 08:07.237
really going to love this.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.364
Just remember, you got

08:07.279 --> 08:09.364
to get that sled team

08:09.406 --> 08:11.241
out to Camp Three for me

08:09.406 --> 08:11.241
before dark.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.409
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

08:12.451 --> 08:13.534
You've driven dogs

08:12.451 --> 08:13.534
before, right?

08:13.576 --> 08:14.619
Because it gets

08:13.576 --> 08:14.619
pretty tricky.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.330
What do I look like?

08:16.371 --> 08:17.664
Stop worrying.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.208
Hey, Neil, you know how

08:17.705 --> 08:20.208
to drive a dog team, right?

08:20.250 --> 08:22.169
Yeah.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.544
Do you still have

08:22.210 --> 08:23.544
a crush on Joe's sister?

08:23.586 --> 08:26.173
Yeah, but Joe won't

08:23.586 --> 08:26.173
let me date her

08:26.214 --> 08:30.010
just 'cause I'm Irish and

08:26.214 --> 08:30.010
I got a bounty on my head.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.137
Let me see what I can do.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.639
(tires screeching)

08:39.686 --> 08:41.229
Sorry.

08:42.563 --> 08:43.898
Sorry.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.238
(tires screech)

08:50.280 --> 08:51.490
Sorry.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.492
Ooh, sorry.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.784
I'm sorry.

08:56.828 --> 08:57.829
Ooh, sorry.

08:57.871 --> 08:58.788
Damn it.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.582
I thought I paid

08:58.830 --> 09:01.582
this gas bill already.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.583
You're doing great.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.751
Turn right up here.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.086
I think you're ready

09:03.793 --> 09:05.086
for street driving.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.588
What?! Jackie's been driving

09:05.128 --> 09:07.588
for half an hour.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.589
Her turn is over.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.467
It's only been

09:08.631 --> 09:10.467
ten minutes, Reese.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.177
No, it hasn't--

09:10.509 --> 09:12.177
I've been timing you.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.054
You've been driving

09:12.219 --> 09:14.054
exactly 27 minutes.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.889
You're going to start

09:14.095 --> 09:15.889
using up my turn.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.598
When did you learn

09:15.930 --> 09:17.598
how to tell time?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.267
Faced. It's digital.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.478
I can't believe I have

09:19.309 --> 09:21.478
to be in the same car

09:21.520 --> 09:22.603
as a low-life like you.

09:22.645 --> 09:23.855
Oh, I'm a low-life?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.606
You're the one that spends

09:23.897 --> 09:25.606
ever day at lunch

09:25.648 --> 09:28.068
sucking on a straw

09:25.648 --> 09:28.068
that's been under my armpit.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.236
You pig!

09:29.277 --> 09:30.987
That's it. I've had it.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.532
I don't even know

09:31.029 --> 09:33.532
what text-messaging is.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.826
How can they charge me

09:33.573 --> 09:36.826
15 bucks a month for it?

09:38.286 --> 09:40.121
Malcolm.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.622
You can't connect those cables.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.624
Their impedance values

09:41.664 --> 09:43.624
aren't equal.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.626
You'll get

09:43.666 --> 09:45.626
a reflected

09:43.666 --> 09:45.626
transmission.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.879
That's what the high-speed

09:45.668 --> 09:47.879
scan modulation is for.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.339
Trust me, 480p is

09:49.381 --> 09:51.132
more than enough

09:49.381 --> 09:51.132
to take care of it.

09:51.174 --> 09:54.010
But then I can't use the analog

09:51.174 --> 09:54.010
pre-amp to play my SACDs.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.637
You're tired.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.637
You're not thinking right.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.473
Did it ever occur to you

09:56.679 --> 09:58.473
that I might be using

09:58.515 --> 10:00.892
single-ended interconnects for

09:58.515 --> 10:00.892
the front left-right speakers?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.102
Are you mad?

10:02.143 --> 10:03.353
You can't do that.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.313
Just watch me.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.648
I know it

10:06.314 --> 10:07.648
sounds weird, but this is

10:07.690 --> 10:10.151
the most fulfilling conversation

10:07.690 --> 10:10.151
I've had in weeks.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.070
JACKIE:

10:10.193 --> 10:12.070
Isn't there supposed

10:10.193 --> 10:12.070
to be some signal

10:12.112 --> 10:14.155
that tells the other cars

10:12.112 --> 10:14.155
to get out of the way?

10:14.197 --> 10:15.656
INSTRUCTOR:

10:14.197 --> 10:15.656
Does anyone see a thingy

10:15.698 --> 10:17.033
of one-cent stamps

10:15.698 --> 10:17.033
by their feet?

10:17.075 --> 10:18.118
REESE:

10:17.075 --> 10:18.118
It's been 45 minutes.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.578
I'm not going

10:18.159 --> 10:19.578
to get my turn.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.661
Okay, pull over.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.084
Finally.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.128
I just need to go

10:26.126 --> 10:28.128
to the post office.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.298
Oh, God,

10:28.169 --> 10:31.298
look at that line.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.549
What are you doing?

10:32.591 --> 10:33.674
It's my turn.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.469
Oh, sorry, Reese,

10:33.716 --> 10:35.469
it doesn't look

10:35.510 --> 10:36.928
like we'll have

10:35.510 --> 10:36.928
enough time,

10:36.970 --> 10:39.680
but you got very valuable

10:36.970 --> 10:39.680
watching experience.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.600
We'll get

10:39.722 --> 10:41.600
to you next week.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.146
Slide over.

10:46.187 --> 10:46.980
No way.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.940
(burps)

10:47.021 --> 10:48.940
Ugh.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.903
I at least get

10:52.235 --> 10:53.903
to drive back

10:53.945 --> 10:55.196
to the stupid school.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.948
I'm not going home

10:55.238 --> 10:56.948
without at least

10:56.990 --> 10:58.699
touching the

10:56.990 --> 10:58.699
steering wheel.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.867
(metallic crunching)

10:59.909 --> 11:00.743
What was that?

11:00.785 --> 11:01.786
You crashed.

11:01.828 --> 11:02.787
No, I didn't.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.705
The car's not

11:02.829 --> 11:04.705
even in drive.

11:04.747 --> 11:05.706
Yeah, well,

11:05.748 --> 11:07.000
you're behind the wheel.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.709
What are you going

11:07.041 --> 11:08.709
to do now, hotshot?

11:08.751 --> 11:10.170
(whimpers)

11:10.211 --> 11:12.130
I'm so sorry, I...

11:12.172 --> 11:14.715
(Reese screams)

11:12.172 --> 11:14.715
(tires squealing)

11:24.559 --> 11:25.893
(horns honking)

11:24.559 --> 11:25.893
JACKIE:

11:24.559 --> 11:25.893
So, let's see.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.354
We've got grand theft auto,

11:27.395 --> 11:29.397
malicious crashing

11:27.395 --> 11:29.397
and what else?

11:29.439 --> 11:31.732
Oh, yeah, kidnapping me.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.443
I always knew

11:31.774 --> 11:33.443
you'd go to prison.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.028
I just figured

11:33.485 --> 11:35.028
it'd be after prom.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.113
Will you shut up and let me

11:35.069 --> 11:37.113
think about this?

11:37.155 --> 11:39.740
Do you realize you are driving

11:37.155 --> 11:39.740
20 miles an hour on a freeway?

11:39.782 --> 11:41.368
Hey, I'm not getting

11:39.782 --> 11:41.368
a speeding ticket

11:41.409 --> 11:42.910
on top of everything else.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.996
Now will you just leave me

11:42.952 --> 11:44.996
alone for a couple of minutes

11:45.038 --> 11:46.540
and let me figure this out?

11:46.581 --> 11:47.832
(siren chirps)

11:47.874 --> 11:50.544
(siren wailing)

11:50.585 --> 11:51.836
Ha!

11:51.878 --> 11:53.796
Okay, don't panic.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.465
It's just a cop.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.465
That's nothing.

11:55.507 --> 11:58.468
You can handle one stupid cop.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.970
(sirens wailing)

12:01.012 --> 12:02.930
Oh, man.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.057
What are you doing?

12:04.098 --> 12:05.766
Aren't you pulling over?

12:05.808 --> 12:06.767
I don't know.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.061
I think I'm still going.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.770
Reese, if you're being

12:08.102 --> 12:09.770
chased by the cops

12:09.812 --> 12:11.772
and they say "pull over,"

12:09.812 --> 12:11.772
you have to do it.

12:11.814 --> 12:12.773
That's a law.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.401
Yeah, well, even so.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.486
You can't...

12:16.528 --> 12:19.780
You know, that's a really

12:16.528 --> 12:19.780
good plan, Reese.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.991
I just see one little

12:19.822 --> 12:21.991
problem with it.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.536
This is a Driver's Ed car!

12:25.704 --> 12:27.955
Those cheap sons of...

12:27.997 --> 12:31.501
(overlapping clamoring)

12:27.997 --> 12:31.501
There no sense screaming to me

12:27.997 --> 12:31.501
about Francis.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.877
I haven't seen him.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.879
I spent five hours

12:32.919 --> 12:34.879
digging post holes

12:34.921 --> 12:36.797
because he promised

12:34.921 --> 12:36.797
me a satellite dish.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.259
He promised  me

12:36.839 --> 12:39.259
a satellite dish.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.802
And where the hell is

12:39.300 --> 12:41.802
my George Foreman grill?

12:41.844 --> 12:43.597
I'm just as mad

12:41.844 --> 12:43.597
as the rest of you.

12:43.638 --> 12:46.807
I'm pretty sure these teeth

12:43.638 --> 12:46.807
came off a dead guy.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.809
Taste like a Canadian.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.311
Well, he's through

12:48.851 --> 12:50.311
taking advantage of me,

12:50.353 --> 12:51.770
I can tell you that.

12:56.276 --> 12:59.738
Well, Pierre, your identical

12:56.276 --> 12:59.738
American cousin

12:59.778 --> 13:01.322
is in a heap of trouble.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.782
Oui.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.828
CRAIG:

13:05.034 --> 13:07.828
Another half turn.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.828
Easy, easy...

13:07.870 --> 13:08.829
Don't strip it.

13:08.871 --> 13:09.997
Got it.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.249
Beautiful.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.668
Now all we have to do is

13:11.291 --> 13:13.668
adjust it and we're done.

13:13.710 --> 13:14.711
Congratulations.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.296
I got to admit, it was

13:14.753 --> 13:16.296
pretty hairy there.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.756
Especially with those

13:16.337 --> 13:17.756
hub connectors.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.132
Stripping that

13:17.796 --> 13:19.132
extra quarter inch

13:19.173 --> 13:20.717
off the copper leads

13:19.173 --> 13:20.717
was inspired.

13:20.759 --> 13:21.842
I hardly even remember it.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.470
I was running on

13:21.884 --> 13:23.470
pure adrenaline.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.640
You know what, Craig,

13:23.511 --> 13:26.640
I got to tell you,

13:26.681 --> 13:28.642
this was a lot of fun.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.644
I actually enjoyed

13:28.683 --> 13:30.644
spending time with you.

13:30.685 --> 13:33.271
You didn't have to lie

13:30.685 --> 13:33.271
to get me over here.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.564
Yes, I did.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.232
Yeah, okay.

13:36.274 --> 13:37.442
But you wouldn't now.

13:37.484 --> 13:42.155
I guess what I'm trying

13:37.484 --> 13:42.155
to say is, you know...

13:42.196 --> 13:44.658
I'm sorry for all the times

13:42.196 --> 13:44.658
we made you miserable.

13:44.699 --> 13:47.368
It's okay.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.662
You're a good guy.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.705
I like you.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.876
Run down and check

13:52.915 --> 13:55.876
the signal, will you?

13:55.918 --> 13:57.712
Okay.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.758
And try not to screw it up...

14:01.800 --> 14:04.469
buddy.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.680
We're getting 42%.

14:06.721 --> 14:09.599
Try moving the dish

14:06.721 --> 14:09.599
a little to the right.

14:09.641 --> 14:13.144
A little more. 57...

14:13.186 --> 14:14.895
Up a little more.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.939
61...

14:16.981 --> 14:19.900
REPORTER:

14:16.981 --> 14:19.900
...a low speed chase

14:16.981 --> 14:19.900
involving a teenager,

14:19.942 --> 14:21.611
a Driver's Ed car

14:21.653 --> 14:23.697
and what appears to be

14:21.653 --> 14:23.697
a hostage.

14:23.738 --> 14:24.989
INSTRUCTOR:

14:23.738 --> 14:24.989
It all happened so fast.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.949
He just took off.

14:26.991 --> 14:30.911
With my checkbook and all

14:26.991 --> 14:30.911
my financial papers in the car.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.205
That's not an excuse.

14:32.246 --> 14:36.083
I just hope that B of A

14:32.246 --> 14:36.083
understands the situation.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.918
REPORTER:

14:36.125 --> 14:37.918
Although the hostage

14:36.125 --> 14:37.918
seems to be unharmed,

14:37.960 --> 14:40.213
it's only a matter of time

14:37.960 --> 14:40.213
before the police decide

14:40.254 --> 14:42.173
to end it one way or the other.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.174
Oh, no!

14:43.216 --> 14:46.052
Now they're never

14:43.216 --> 14:46.052
going to let me drive.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.932
How's it looking?

14:51.974 --> 14:54.769
Malcolm?

14:54.811 --> 14:55.936
Malcolm?!

14:55.978 --> 14:58.939
I can't hear you.

14:58.981 --> 15:02.235
You're not watching

14:58.981 --> 15:02.235
without me, are you?

15:03.986 --> 15:05.905
(screams)

15:07.490 --> 15:08.991
Malcolm!

15:09.033 --> 15:12.161
Malcolm!

15:12.203 --> 15:13.954
(reporter speaks indistinctly

15:12.203 --> 15:13.954
on TV)

15:13.996 --> 15:16.750
Just let me talk to him

15:16.791 --> 15:18.877
and I can end this

15:16.791 --> 15:18.877
in five minutes.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.961
I'm sorry, ma'am, I don't

15:18.918 --> 15:20.961
think that's a good idea.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.589
We have trained psychologists

15:22.630 --> 15:24.382
to handle kids

15:22.630 --> 15:24.382
in these situations.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.550
We know how they think.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.427
Think? My son

15:25.592 --> 15:27.427
doesn't think.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.970
He's just driving

15:27.468 --> 15:29.970
around in circles.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.014
He's made three laps

15:30.012 --> 15:32.014
around the city already.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.558
There's our

15:32.056 --> 15:33.558
dry cleaner again.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.560
Here's another picture

15:33.600 --> 15:35.560
of my brother

15:35.602 --> 15:36.853
you can show on TV.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.981
Just get him on the phone

15:38.062 --> 15:40.981
and let me handle this.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.692
I'm the only one

15:41.023 --> 15:42.692
who knows how.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.485
Trust me, we have this

15:42.734 --> 15:44.485
under control.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.613
Don't think I don't know

15:44.527 --> 15:46.613
what's going to happen.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.865
You're going to do your

15:46.654 --> 15:48.865
standard police thing

15:48.907 --> 15:51.409
and my son is going to get

15:48.907 --> 15:51.409
killed in a hail of gunfire.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.203
Ma'am, that almost

15:51.451 --> 15:54.203
never happens.

15:54.245 --> 15:59.166
Just get him on the phone!

15:59.208 --> 16:02.002
And you tell him, if he ever

15:59.208 --> 16:02.002
wants to see daylight again,

16:02.044 --> 16:03.463
he'll pull over this instant!

16:03.504 --> 16:05.715
OFFICER (on loudspeaker):

16:03.504 --> 16:05.715
Your mother wants you to know

16:05.757 --> 16:07.007
that she loves you and...

16:07.049 --> 16:10.010
He has ten seconds to pull over

16:07.049 --> 16:10.010
that damn car, or I will...

16:10.052 --> 16:13.013
...give you lots

16:10.052 --> 16:13.013
of hugs and kisses.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.641
You heard your mom,

16:13.055 --> 16:14.641
you're not in trouble.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.434
Can you pull over now?

16:16.476 --> 16:19.103
That's not my mom.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.320
Please, dear God...

16:27.361 --> 16:29.864
I know I haven't been a saint,

16:27.361 --> 16:29.864
but I swear if you...

16:29.906 --> 16:32.116
(screams)

16:33.701 --> 16:36.621
(sirens wailing)

16:36.663 --> 16:38.748
No, Daddy,

16:36.663 --> 16:38.748
this is not my fault.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.959
I'm just a passenger.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.043
How is this making  you

16:41.000 --> 16:43.043
look like a chump?

16:43.085 --> 16:44.712
I'm the one...

16:44.754 --> 16:46.422
Hold on.

16:46.464 --> 16:49.049
Hello? No.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.092
No, I'm on the other line.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.719
If you want to talk

16:50.134 --> 16:51.719
to him so bad,

16:51.761 --> 16:52.971
use the bullhorn thingy.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.097
Hi, I'm back.

16:55.139 --> 16:58.977
No, I was not talking to Mom.

16:55.139 --> 16:58.977
It was the...

16:59.018 --> 17:01.354
Daddy, I don't care who she's...

17:01.395 --> 17:03.105
No, I will not tell her.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.734
You have to stop

17:03.147 --> 17:06.734
putting me in...

17:06.776 --> 17:08.068
Go ahead, you know what?

17:06.776 --> 17:08.068
Go ahead

17:08.110 --> 17:10.780
cancel the card...

17:08.110 --> 17:10.780
cancel all my cards.

17:10.822 --> 17:14.909
I'm going to be in this car

17:10.822 --> 17:14.909
for the rest of my life anyway.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.703
Okay, I've

17:14.951 --> 17:16.703
got an idea.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.703
What?

17:16.744 --> 17:18.538
There's a railroad crossing

17:16.744 --> 17:18.538
about a mile ahead.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.331
If we jump out

17:18.579 --> 17:20.331
a split second

17:20.373 --> 17:21.916
before the train

17:20.373 --> 17:21.916
squashes the car,

17:21.958 --> 17:24.084
we can start new lives

17:21.958 --> 17:24.084
as circus people.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.963
Reese, come on.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.963
This is getting scary.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.089
What are you going to do?

17:29.131 --> 17:30.466
(dings)

17:30.508 --> 17:32.134
OFFICER (on loudspeaker):

17:30.508 --> 17:32.134
This is your last warning.

17:32.176 --> 17:35.346
Pull over or you will be forced

17:32.176 --> 17:35.346
from the road.

17:36.430 --> 17:39.475
Jackie, I have

17:36.430 --> 17:39.475
to tell you something.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.810
Just because

17:39.517 --> 17:40.810
I hate you,

17:40.852 --> 17:43.103
doesn't mean

17:40.852 --> 17:43.103
I'm not sorry.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.146
What?

17:44.188 --> 17:45.523
I didn't mean to

17:44.188 --> 17:45.523
get you into this.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.776
It's just that I'm not,

17:45.565 --> 17:48.776
you know, I'm not very smart.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.403
So when I get in

17:48.818 --> 17:50.403
trouble, I panic

17:50.444 --> 17:52.697
and then I do things

17:50.444 --> 17:52.697
that make it worse.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.490
I'm really sorry.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.200
And your dad is a tool.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.788
Hey, I was just kidding

17:58.160 --> 18:00.788
about the kidnapping thing.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.123
I mean, you have enough

18:00.830 --> 18:03.123
to worry about

18:03.165 --> 18:04.959
without me being a jerk

18:03.165 --> 18:04.959
about it, right?

18:05.001 --> 18:07.378
Wait a second.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.963
Jackie, give me your phone.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.840
I have a brother

18:09.005 --> 18:10.840
who's a total genius.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.216
He'll know what to do.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.301
How many police cars

18:12.258 --> 18:14.301
are chasing you?

18:14.343 --> 18:16.136
I don't know,

18:14.343 --> 18:16.136
eight, maybe nine.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.514
What are we going to do?

18:16.178 --> 18:18.514
There's no way out of this.

18:18.556 --> 18:19.432
Hey, don't give up.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.059
Sometimes things look

18:19.473 --> 18:21.059
their darkest

18:21.100 --> 18:22.852
right before

18:21.100 --> 18:22.852
the sun breaks through.

18:29.567 --> 18:34.030
And sometimes you just have

18:29.567 --> 18:34.030
to realize that the game is over

18:34.072 --> 18:37.116
and that you've lost. The...

18:42.872 --> 18:46.166
The only thing left to do is

18:42.872 --> 18:46.166
to stop running, stand up

18:46.208 --> 18:49.128
and face the consequences

18:46.208 --> 18:49.128
like a man. And...

18:54.467 --> 18:56.970
And even if the outcome

18:54.467 --> 18:56.970
is going to be more horrible

18:57.011 --> 18:58.638
than you could've

18:57.011 --> 18:58.638
possibly imagined,

18:58.679 --> 19:01.474
you can hold your head up high,

18:58.679 --> 19:01.474
show some class

19:01.515 --> 19:03.935
and end it with dignity.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.230
Class.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.190
For the love of God,

19:08.272 --> 19:10.190
not the stump rooter!

19:10.232 --> 19:11.692
No!

19:14.278 --> 19:15.905
Where is he going?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.198
He's turning.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.701
(sirens wailing)

19:26.248 --> 19:29.085
♪ ♪

19:49.271 --> 19:50.272
Wow. Nice.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.692
It was.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.910
Okay, that's impressive.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.203
Look, he's pulling over.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.959
I think he's going

20:08.290 --> 20:09.959
to parallel park.

20:10.001 --> 20:10.668
No way.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.252
The spot is way too small.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.130
He's going too fast

20:12.294 --> 20:14.130
and he hasn't given himself

20:14.172 --> 20:15.548
enough space on the right!

20:20.720 --> 20:24.974
He did it.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.974
Now just get out

20:20.720 --> 20:24.974
of the damn car, please.

20:25.016 --> 20:27.601
Reese, that was amazing.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.648
Listen, when

20:29.228 --> 20:32.648
the kids at school

20:29.228 --> 20:32.648
ask you about this...

20:32.690 --> 20:34.942
tell them I got

20:32.690 --> 20:34.942
under your bra.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.487
(grunting)

20:40.990 --> 20:43.826
I'll call the lawyer

20:40.990 --> 20:43.826
and have him meet us there.

20:44.702 --> 20:45.953
Cuff him.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.497
(handcuffs clicking)

20:51.333 --> 20:55.922
Give them a reason.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.174
REPORTER:

20:55.963 --> 20:58.174
The suspect appears

20:55.963 --> 20:58.174
to be resisting.

20:58.216 --> 21:00.384
Oh, looks like they're taking

20:58.216 --> 21:00.384
out the pepper spray.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.261
(Reese screams)

21:05.347 --> 21:07.141
Why do we have to get

21:05.347 --> 21:07.141
dressed like this?

21:07.183 --> 21:08.142
It's Reese's hearing.

21:08.184 --> 21:09.518
Because when the judge

21:08.184 --> 21:09.518
looks over at us,

21:09.560 --> 21:12.312
I want him to see

21:09.560 --> 21:12.312
that Reese comes from

21:09.560 --> 21:12.312
a respectable family

21:12.354 --> 21:13.313
that loves him very much.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.399
Why aren't they trying

21:13.355 --> 21:15.399
him as an adult?

21:15.441 --> 21:16.776
Come on, we got to go.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.236
I have to go

21:16.817 --> 21:18.236
to Craig's after.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.528
Jellybean is getting

21:18.277 --> 21:19.528
his cast off

21:19.570 --> 21:21.030
and he wants me

21:19.570 --> 21:21.030
to videotape it.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.907
Craig's talking already?

21:21.072 --> 21:22.907
Good for him.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.784
I was really creeped out

21:22.949 --> 21:24.784
about that whole

21:24.825 --> 21:26.786
"one blink, yes,

21:24.825 --> 21:26.786
two blinks, no" stuff.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.412
No, you got it the other

21:26.827 --> 21:28.412
way around, Hal.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.664
One blink means "no."

21:31.958 --> 21:35.461
So the soup  was  too hot.
