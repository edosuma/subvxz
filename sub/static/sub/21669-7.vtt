WEBVTT

00:00.530 --> 00:02.620
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.621 --> 00:05.455
The civil war on the red team
continued...

00:05.456 --> 00:08.057
The Kimmie-Tiffany-Robyn
alliance

00:08.058 --> 00:10.193
is definitely
gonna target me next.

00:10.194 --> 00:11.895
Leaving Christina and Dana

00:11.896 --> 00:13.529
feeling vulnerable.

00:13.530 --> 00:16.132
I have you, and, like,
I have nobody else.

00:16.133 --> 00:18.468
As for the blue team,
Royce made a play for power...

00:18.469 --> 00:20.670
I'll put my name up there,
if you guys want a new leader.

00:20.671 --> 00:23.006
But found little support.

00:23.007 --> 00:24.307
He talks, "I'm like this,
I'm like that.

00:24.308 --> 00:25.241
I'm like this,
I'm like that."

00:25.242 --> 00:26.676
I don't feel
that you're leading.

00:26.677 --> 00:28.344
I think you're blowing smoke
and mirrors.

00:28.345 --> 00:29.412
Stop trying to show off.

00:29.413 --> 00:31.114
In the challenge...

00:31.115 --> 00:32.768
You'll be creating
a tasting menu

00:32.769 --> 00:35.283
for three fashion designers.

00:35.284 --> 00:37.720
But judges explain
exactly what they wanted...

00:37.721 --> 00:39.389
Something with a little bit
of spice.

00:39.390 --> 00:40.657
I can't have anything fatty.

00:40.658 --> 00:42.358
Which fell on deaf ears

00:42.359 --> 00:43.393
in the red kitchen.

00:43.394 --> 00:44.661
We have eggplant fry.

00:44.662 --> 00:46.496
<i>Fried food
is a big no-no.</i>

00:46.497 --> 00:48.398
Quite bland.
We asked for something spicy.

00:48.399 --> 00:50.099
And Robyn's supposed best friend

00:50.100 --> 00:51.901
was quick to lay blame...

00:51.902 --> 00:54.437
I said spice.
She didn't want to use it.

00:54.438 --> 00:56.306
Don't get bullied by Robyn.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.407
I'm done with Robyn walking
over me.

00:57.408 --> 00:58.574
<i>Blue team, congratulations.</i>

00:58.575 --> 01:00.476
Giving six men

01:00.477 --> 01:02.712
and one little lady
a much-needed victory.

01:02.713 --> 01:04.346
Feels great to be a winner!

01:04.348 --> 01:06.082
After the challenge,

01:06.083 --> 01:07.583
the Robyn-Kimmie rift
deepened...

01:07.584 --> 01:09.585
I didn't sabotage you.

01:09.586 --> 01:11.487
As they unbelievably
went from best friends...

01:11.488 --> 01:13.089
Don't talk to me right now.

01:13.090 --> 01:14.190
I don't even want to look
at Robyn.

01:14.191 --> 01:15.291
She makes me sick.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.492
To worst enemies.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.795
I've been nothing
but helping this girl out

01:18.796 --> 01:21.030
since the beginning.

01:22.399 --> 01:24.267
If I could hit her, I would.

01:24.268 --> 01:25.835
Prior to the start

01:25.836 --> 01:27.003
of the first ever
fashion show dinner service...

01:27.004 --> 01:28.271
Gorgeous.

01:28.272 --> 01:31.641
Chef Ramsay had
very specific instructions...

01:31.642 --> 01:34.077
Nothing gets sent until
the first catwalk takes place.

01:34.078 --> 01:35.912
That Clemenza either ignored...

01:35.913 --> 01:37.347
Stop! Clemenza.

01:37.348 --> 01:38.982
Or misunderstood.

01:38.983 --> 01:40.216
What are you doing?

01:40.217 --> 01:41.651
Got four scallops, chef.

01:41.652 --> 01:43.419
Clemenza.

01:43.420 --> 01:45.388
Either way,
the blue team was in trouble.

01:45.389 --> 01:46.222
Why is he cooking the scallops?

01:46.223 --> 01:48.191
Someone's leaving right now.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.993
Tonight, find out if Clemenza

01:49.994 --> 01:51.594
has made his last mistake...

01:51.595 --> 01:53.162
Ready to go home?

01:53.163 --> 01:54.931
On one of the most shocking...

01:54.932 --> 01:56.466
What is this?

01:56.467 --> 01:58.028
<i>Hell's Kitchens ever...</i>

01:58.029 --> 01:59.754
Stop!
As the competition...

01:59.755 --> 02:01.132
See that door out there?
Yes, chef.

02:01.133 --> 02:02.672
Hey, I'll boot you out there.

02:02.673 --> 02:04.574
To become head chef
at Gordon Ramsay Steak

02:04.575 --> 02:06.242
at Paris, Las Vegas
continues.

<i>of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

03:09.006 --> 03:12.141
<i>Tonight, it's Hell's Kitchen's
first ever fashion night.</i>

03:12.142 --> 03:13.743
We've gotta go.

03:13.744 --> 03:15.812
I have to say one thing,
and I need everyone,

03:15.813 --> 03:17.914
<i>please, in their clothes now.</i>

03:17.915 --> 03:20.516
With the models in
last-minute prep for the show...

03:20.517 --> 03:22.051
<i>All right, let's get ready.</i>

03:22.052 --> 03:24.287
The red kitchen
is getting pumped up

03:24.288 --> 03:25.521
for service to begin.

03:25.522 --> 03:28.024
<i>All right, ladies,
let's look alive.</i>

03:28.025 --> 03:29.525
And in the blue kitchen,

03:29.526 --> 03:30.726
despite the fact
that no diners have entered

03:30.727 --> 03:32.829
and chef Ramsay has yet
to call an order,

03:32.830 --> 03:36.032
Clemenza mysteriously tries
to get ahead

03:36.033 --> 03:38.000
<i>by cooking one
of Hell's Kitchen's</i>

03:38.001 --> 03:39.635
most popular dishes in advance.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.038
<i>Stop!</i>

03:42.039 --> 03:43.739
<i>What are you doing?</i>

03:43.740 --> 03:46.175
Nothing gets sent
until the first catwalk.

03:46.176 --> 03:47.977
<i>You knew that, right?
Yes, chef.</i>

03:47.978 --> 03:49.212
Did you know that?

03:49.213 --> 03:50.680
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

03:50.681 --> 03:53.316
So why is he cooking
the scallops?

03:53.317 --> 03:55.251
Clemenza, talk to me.

03:55.252 --> 03:57.053
I made a mistake, chef.
It won't happen again.

03:57.054 --> 03:58.554
Oh, come on.

03:58.555 --> 04:00.656
I just start firing scallops
like an idiot,

04:00.657 --> 04:02.458
and people that knew
staring at me.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.393
No one says a word.

04:04.394 --> 04:06.462
<i>How many portions of scallops
have we wasted?</i>

04:06.463 --> 04:08.598
<i>Four.
hell.</i>

04:08.599 --> 04:09.932
Clemenza, come on.

04:09.933 --> 04:11.501
He needs to be in attention

04:11.502 --> 04:13.202
to what the going on
in that kitchen.

04:13.203 --> 04:14.537
Okay, James, open Hell's Kitchen,
please... let's go.

04:14.538 --> 04:15.805
Yes, chef.

04:24.515 --> 04:27.283
<i>For the first time
in Hell's Kitchen history,</i>

04:27.284 --> 04:29.018
there will be three
mini-fashion shows

04:29.019 --> 04:30.586
during dinner service,

04:30.587 --> 04:32.455
featuring the designs
of Ina Soltani,

04:32.456 --> 04:35.124
Amanda Shay,
and David Meister.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.993
You look fabulous.

04:36.994 --> 04:38.995
After each show,
the chefs must be ready

04:38.996 --> 04:42.832
to send out the next course
to the invited VIP guests.

04:42.833 --> 04:44.433
Mwah.

04:44.434 --> 04:45.935
To ensure that all the dishes

04:45.936 --> 04:47.970
get out as quickly as possible,

04:47.971 --> 04:50.273
chef Ramsay has selected Royce
on the blue team and...

04:50.274 --> 04:51.807
Kimmie, come on.

04:51.808 --> 04:53.643
Kimmie on the red team...

04:53.644 --> 04:54.744
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go.</i>

04:54.745 --> 04:56.379
To help
plate food at the pass.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.080
Hey, guys,
remember really quick,

04:58.081 --> 04:59.749
there's models,
and there's swimsuit models.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.083
<i>I've already ordered blinders.</i>

05:01.084 --> 05:02.685
<i>You know what my blinder is?</i>

05:02.686 --> 05:03.753
Chef Ramsay.

05:03.754 --> 05:05.288
Ladies, an order...

05:05.289 --> 05:06.989
Four scallops,
two lobster salads.

05:06.990 --> 05:08.357
Yes, chef.

05:08.358 --> 05:09.158
<i>The first part
of the fashion show</i>

05:09.159 --> 05:10.960
is about to begin.

05:10.961 --> 05:13.029
I'll give you the heads-up
two minutes from the end.

05:13.030 --> 05:14.096
And then we're flying.
Get organized.

05:14.097 --> 05:15.998
Yes, chef.

05:15.999 --> 05:17.366
I'm confident with the fish
station... I'm ready for it.

05:17.367 --> 05:20.203
I don't wanna get yelled at.
I don't wanna get kicked out.

05:20.204 --> 05:21.304
I want everything to be okay.
That's all I want.

05:21.305 --> 05:22.838
While both teams prepare

05:22.839 --> 05:24.807
to start their appetizers,
in the dining room...

05:24.808 --> 05:26.609
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:26.610 --> 05:28.611
<i>the ready-to-wear collection
of Ina Soltani.</i>

05:28.612 --> 05:30.780
Part one of the
fashion show is beginning.

05:35.586 --> 05:36.686
Ohh, models.

05:36.687 --> 05:38.254
Lots of them.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.889
It's gonna be
a pretty hot night

05:39.890 --> 05:41.057
in Hell's Kitchen.

05:42.192 --> 05:45.127
I hate those models.

05:45.128 --> 05:46.896
Like, I don't want them
looking at us.

05:46.897 --> 05:48.598
I'm trying to work here.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.633
Is she hungry, that girl?
We should feed her.

05:50.634 --> 05:51.834
They don't even eat.

05:51.835 --> 05:54.904
Why are they in a restaurant?

05:54.905 --> 05:56.806
I definitely could pick them up

05:56.807 --> 05:59.008
and probably, like,
snap them in half...

05:59.009 --> 06:00.910
With one hand.

06:00.911 --> 06:02.378
Just under two minutes
to the window.

06:02.379 --> 06:03.746
Yes, chef.

06:03.747 --> 06:06.182
I should lose, like,
9,000 pounds and stop eating.

06:06.183 --> 06:08.217
I could be a fashion model.

06:08.218 --> 06:10.620
Yes, look at me.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.990
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ina Soltani.

06:13.991 --> 06:16.692
<i>Thank you, ladies.</i>

06:16.693 --> 06:19.095
All right, ladies.
Yes, chef.

06:19.096 --> 06:20.663
<i>Spotlight's on us.
Here we go, overdrive.</i>

06:20.664 --> 06:21.998
Wake up, let's go.
Six scallops away.

06:21.999 --> 06:23.165
Yes, chef.

06:23.166 --> 06:24.967
We have only three appetizers.

06:24.968 --> 06:28.804
If we can't pull this off,
then that's pretty lame-o.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.539
<i>Use this pan or this pan,</i>

06:30.540 --> 06:32.074
but make sure
it's in the center.

06:32.075 --> 06:33.409
It's not hot enough.

06:33.410 --> 06:35.111
<i>Don't forget the oil.
All right, Barbie.</i>

06:35.112 --> 06:36.212
I'm gonna wait
to throw the order on.

06:36.213 --> 06:37.747
<i>Just trying to help,
Tiff, okay?</i>

06:37.748 --> 06:39.181
Tiffany just has no finesse.

06:39.182 --> 06:41.751
She doesn't pay attention.

06:41.752 --> 06:43.619
And even when you try
to correct her,

06:43.620 --> 06:44.954
it pisses her off.

06:44.955 --> 06:47.390
Tiffany, they stick
when the pan's not hot enough.

06:47.391 --> 06:48.924
<i>How come mine aren't sticking?</i>

06:48.925 --> 06:49.925
That was yours.

06:49.926 --> 06:50.826
I don't want help.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.762
I'm sick of listening to her.

06:52.763 --> 06:54.497
I don't care what
she has to say. She sucks.

06:54.498 --> 06:55.331
She can't work on the line.
I've just had it.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.265
Scallops, please!

06:56.266 --> 06:58.000
I got 'em right here.

06:59.803 --> 07:02.664
They're just squawking
and bitching at each other.

07:02.665 --> 07:04.039
Leave it, stop.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.695
Scallops, chef.

07:06.681 --> 07:09.325
Chef, these aren't...
They're not cooked, Kimmy?

07:09.326 --> 07:10.106
No, they're not.

07:10.107 --> 07:12.606
They're not even got any color
on the back of them.

07:13.612 --> 07:14.527
Stop.

07:14.528 --> 07:16.156
Hey, all of you.
Come here a minute.

07:16.157 --> 07:17.673
Just come here.
Come here.

07:17.674 --> 07:20.565
What is that?
That, yeah that.

07:25.167 --> 07:26.690
What hurts more than anything...

07:26.691 --> 07:29.911
We've done this dish hundreds,
and hundreds, and hundreds of time.

07:29.912 --> 07:32.561
I'm not an "I told you so"
kind of person,

07:32.562 --> 07:34.791
but, you know...

07:34.792 --> 07:36.301
Who cooked them?

07:36.302 --> 07:38.285
I don't know...
You don't know!

07:38.286 --> 07:41.919
You don't know who cooked
those scallops? Please.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.181
Do you think I'm serving that?
Trust me... You are dreaming.

07:45.182 --> 07:47.383
This is a joke now.
This is a joke.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.067
It's not funny, chef.

07:51.328 --> 07:53.295
I hate her.

07:56.719 --> 07:58.380
It's a bad day, ladies.

08:01.101 --> 08:04.160
While Tiffany takes control
on the scallops...

08:04.161 --> 08:07.268
In the blue kitchen...
Three lobster, two tuna, one scallops.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.769
Let's go.
Justin and Roshni on appetizers

08:09.770 --> 08:13.206
and Clemenza on
are ready with their first orders.

08:13.207 --> 08:14.533
Here we go.

08:19.394 --> 08:21.277
Service, please.
Thank you.

08:21.278 --> 08:22.426
Things are coming out of the kitchen.

08:22.427 --> 08:24.690
We're communicating,
we're kicking ass.

08:24.691 --> 08:27.038
It's clock work.

08:27.039 --> 08:29.226
Three scallops, one lobster salads.
Yes, chef!

08:29.227 --> 08:33.087
After three scallops, one lobster...
Four scallops, two lobster, two tuna.

08:33.089 --> 08:33.864
Yes, chef.

08:33.865 --> 08:36.894
After that, four scallops.
After that... I hope you're listening.

08:36.895 --> 08:38.340
I hope you're listening.

08:38.341 --> 08:40.431
Three lobster, two tuna,
one scallops.

08:40.432 --> 08:43.150
After that, four scallops away.
Let's go, Clemenza.

08:43.775 --> 08:46.335
16 scallops?
16 scallops, yeah.

08:46.336 --> 08:48.738
Come on, Clemenza!
Yes, chef!

08:55.623 --> 08:58.699
While Clemenza prepares to cook
a mountain of scallops...

08:58.700 --> 09:02.491
In the red kitchen, Tiffany...
Walking out with six scallops, guys.

09:02.492 --> 09:04.727
Is desperate
to impress chef Ramsay

09:04.728 --> 09:05.528
with her second attempt.

09:05.529 --> 09:07.496
<i>Scallops, chef.</i>

09:07.497 --> 09:09.064
Nice.
It looks amazing.

09:09.065 --> 09:11.767
Oh, yeah. That's right.

09:11.768 --> 09:13.636
I am the .

09:13.637 --> 09:15.571
With Tiffany's
success on the scallops...

09:15.572 --> 09:17.606
Service, please.

09:17.607 --> 09:19.975
It's now up to close
friends Christina and Dana...

09:19.976 --> 09:21.811
One tuna walking.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.946
On appetizers
to keep up the momentum.

09:23.947 --> 09:25.314
What do you guys need
over here?

09:25.315 --> 09:28.083
But somebody is
looking to help out the duo.

09:28.084 --> 09:29.752
Do I need to make
more green beans and stuff?

09:29.753 --> 09:31.387
I'm bringing this up.

09:31.388 --> 09:33.189
Behind, coming through.
Just give it to me.

09:33.190 --> 09:34.657
Let me help.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.659
I'm trying to help
Christina and Dana out,

09:36.660 --> 09:38.694
and they're like,
"we don't need any help."

09:38.695 --> 09:39.595
Four lobster salads, yes?
How long?

09:39.596 --> 09:41.730
Walking.
Let me help.

09:41.731 --> 09:43.833
I trust you helping me.
Trust me helping you.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.202
<i>I'll heat it up for you.
You can do that if you want.</i>

09:46.203 --> 09:47.102
No, no, no.
I got it.

09:47.103 --> 09:48.904
I'm looking at her
like, "seriously?"

09:48.905 --> 09:50.272
I don't need
your help right now.

09:50.273 --> 09:54.276
Please just back
the up.

09:54.277 --> 09:56.178
She has, like,
this big ego thing

09:56.179 --> 09:57.546
where she doesn't want
any help.

09:57.547 --> 09:58.781
Set it down. I got it.

09:58.782 --> 10:00.282
Well, one day,
you're gonna need help,

10:00.283 --> 10:01.150
and no one's gonna give it
to you

10:01.151 --> 10:03.185
'cause you keep on
pushing it away.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.119
I feel good rhythm.
I think these guys...

10:04.120 --> 10:05.521
they won't let me
go over there.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.089
<i>Dude, I don't know
what to tell you.</i>

10:07.090 --> 10:08.991
While Robyn is
still looking for work,

10:08.992 --> 10:11.360
Christina and Dana
manage to push out

10:11.361 --> 10:12.962
a steady stream of appetizers.

10:12.963 --> 10:14.263
Service, please.

10:14.264 --> 10:15.731
And 20 minutes

10:15.732 --> 10:17.833
into dinner service,
all of the diners

10:17.834 --> 10:19.134
on the red side are thrilled
with what they've received.

10:19.135 --> 10:20.669
It's really good.

10:20.670 --> 10:22.471
It's not what
I was expecting at all.

10:22.472 --> 10:23.839
<i>Get ready for entrees, okay?</i>

10:23.840 --> 10:25.374
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

10:25.375 --> 10:27.309
Now the only
thing standing in the way

10:27.310 --> 10:28.644
of the second part
of the fashion show

10:28.645 --> 10:30.145
is a completed
appetizer service,

10:30.146 --> 10:31.514
which means...

10:31.515 --> 10:33.916
Scallop in the window.

10:33.917 --> 10:36.619
Clemenza must
deliver 16 orders of scallops.

10:36.620 --> 10:38.587
Overcooked and rubber.
Start again.

10:38.588 --> 10:41.090
<i>Clemenza, you're holding us up.</i>

10:41.091 --> 10:43.592
I got six.
I got six orders going.

10:43.593 --> 10:46.328
There's only so much room on one
side of the stove.

10:46.329 --> 10:47.596
Two scallops... how long?

10:47.597 --> 10:48.764
Two minutes.

10:48.765 --> 10:50.466
You got six scallops going.

10:50.467 --> 10:52.434
There's no other room
to get out another two.

10:52.435 --> 10:54.436
Unless you want me to
put two pans on my ass

10:54.437 --> 10:56.205
and start cooking
back there,

10:56.206 --> 10:57.406
You're gonna have to wait.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.341
How many?
How many more?

10:59.342 --> 11:00.976
Clemenza... I can see it
in his face already

11:00.977 --> 11:03.579
how frustrated he's getting.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.714
Can somebody help him
with the scallops?!

11:05.715 --> 11:06.782
And I know we're going down.

11:06.783 --> 11:08.384
You want me to sear
some scallops on this side?

11:08.385 --> 11:09.285
Yes.

11:09.286 --> 11:11.387
Okay, I got two orders
working here.

11:11.388 --> 11:12.922
We were just hoping
that we would find out

11:12.923 --> 11:14.557
when the show
will be able to start.

11:14.558 --> 11:16.425
Hey, guys, hurry up!
Come on!

11:16.426 --> 11:18.627
<i>I've got to start
the next show.</i>

11:18.628 --> 11:21.764
<i>Scallops, please!
Coming up.</i>

11:21.765 --> 11:23.198
Over--cooked.

11:23.199 --> 11:26.368
<i>Stop!
All of you come here.</i>

11:26.369 --> 11:28.270
Look, now we got
overcooked .

11:28.271 --> 11:32.007
Horribly done, gray rubber.

11:32.008 --> 11:33.642
Feel that. Feel it.

11:33.643 --> 11:35.044
It's cooked to .

11:35.045 --> 11:36.579
<i>Who cooked them?
I did.</i>

11:36.580 --> 11:39.214
Guy, I'd rather you do it
with control

11:39.215 --> 11:42.451
than try and rush them
and create that mess.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.853
Oh, my God.
We're done.

11:44.854 --> 11:46.121
Clemenza.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.425
Clemenza!
Scallops, please!

11:49.426 --> 11:50.826
Everyone in line now.

11:50.827 --> 11:52.194
We're not stopping.

11:54.064 --> 11:56.940
I'm running out of time.

12:02.578 --> 12:05.013
40 minutes into dinner service,

12:05.014 --> 12:06.982
<i>on the first ever
Hell's Kitchen fashion night...</i>

12:06.983 --> 12:10.018
If somebody tries to get you
to change your shoes, hit them.

12:10.019 --> 12:11.787
The red team has
finished all their appetizers.

12:11.788 --> 12:14.089
All right, guys.
Way to push through, man.

12:14.090 --> 12:15.824
But the second part of
the fashion show can't start...

12:15.825 --> 12:17.459
Let's get in line.

12:17.460 --> 12:18.960
Until the blue team

12:18.961 --> 12:20.395
completes their first course.

12:20.396 --> 12:22.764
That's overcooked.
Start again.

12:22.765 --> 12:25.367
Guy just fumbled
on the scallops,

12:25.368 --> 12:27.135
and I'm watching Clemenza
go down

12:27.136 --> 12:28.737
like a body in the east river.

12:28.738 --> 12:29.671
Get that scallop
perfectly, guys.

12:29.672 --> 12:31.039
Come on, brother.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.174
It's scallops.

12:32.175 --> 12:34.309
I mean, it's scal-lops.

12:34.310 --> 12:36.445
<i>Scallops... how long?</i>

12:36.446 --> 12:38.046
Two minutes.
Three minutes.

12:38.047 --> 12:39.281
Three minutes.
Three minutes, chef.

12:40.817 --> 12:42.684
<i>Royce, get out there</i>

12:42.685 --> 12:44.419
and tell them
we need an extra five minutes.

12:44.420 --> 12:48.457
Hurry up.
Yes, chef.

12:48.458 --> 12:50.726
Excuse me.

12:50.727 --> 12:52.594
♪ oh ♪

12:52.595 --> 12:53.929
I find a room full of models.

12:53.930 --> 12:54.796
I walked in,
and as soon as I saw

12:54.797 --> 12:55.464
the first model, I was like...

12:57.567 --> 12:59.801
<i>Yes?
We need an extra five minutes.</i>

12:59.802 --> 13:01.703
But she's wilting.

13:01.704 --> 13:04.039
Love it if you could get it
together really quick.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.941
Yes, thank you very much.
I'll let everybody know.

13:05.942 --> 13:07.075
<i>Okay.</i>

13:07.076 --> 13:08.977
I relayed my message
and got the outta there.

13:08.978 --> 13:10.912
I'm worrying
about a perfect service.

13:10.913 --> 13:12.748
I'm worrying about winning
this $250,000, and then...

13:12.749 --> 13:16.418
so I can take a model
on a hot date, baby.

13:16.419 --> 13:17.619
Uhh.

13:17.620 --> 13:20.088
<i>Scallops?
40 seconds, chef.</i>

13:20.089 --> 13:21.723
Come on, Clemenza.

13:21.724 --> 13:23.725
We got four right now.
We got three following.

13:23.726 --> 13:25.527
It's a mess.

13:25.528 --> 13:26.828
There's no way
that I'm gonna sit there

13:26.829 --> 13:27.763
and let him go down.

13:27.764 --> 13:30.031
No way.
I am jumping on.

13:30.032 --> 13:32.033
<i>Here we go.
Scallops, please... how long?</i>

13:32.034 --> 13:32.868
Good? Go.

13:32.869 --> 13:33.368
<i>Walking with three.</i>

13:33.369 --> 13:35.969
Right behind you.

13:42.044 --> 13:44.312
From Brian, Clemenza's scallops

13:44.313 --> 13:46.515
are now worthy of being served
to the VIP guests.

13:46.516 --> 13:48.583
<i>Let's go, please.</i>

13:48.584 --> 13:50.185
A disaster has been averted,

13:50.186 --> 13:52.587
as the men deliver
all their appetizers.

13:52.588 --> 13:53.955
Really good.

13:53.956 --> 13:55.924
These scallops
are out of this world.

13:55.925 --> 13:57.893
James, please.
Sorry about the delay.

13:57.894 --> 13:59.294
Let's do the second half,
please.

13:59.295 --> 14:00.228
Yes, chef.

14:00.229 --> 14:01.630
Come here, quick.
Listen.

14:01.631 --> 14:04.533
<i>That timing was dreadful.</i>

14:04.534 --> 14:05.767
Really dreadful.

14:05.768 --> 14:07.469
Now we got a second show.

14:07.470 --> 14:09.604
<i>I'm gonna fire these entrees</i>

14:09.605 --> 14:11.540
so as when that last model
walks off that catwalk,

14:11.541 --> 14:12.774
our food is leaving.

14:12.775 --> 14:14.342
Yes, chef.

14:14.343 --> 14:16.645
What's your first six tables?

14:16.646 --> 14:18.613
Four beef and two swordfish.

14:18.614 --> 14:20.415
That's six tables.
Yes, chef.

14:20.416 --> 14:22.217
What's your first three tables?

14:22.218 --> 14:23.685
Our first three tables
are swordfish, pigeon...

14:23.686 --> 14:25.620
How many?
Uh...

14:25.621 --> 14:27.155
<i>Come on, Barbie!</i>

14:27.156 --> 14:29.191
Uh, we have five swordfish
to start.

14:29.192 --> 14:30.792
Robyn, what's going?

14:30.793 --> 14:32.661
<i>Four beef and two pigeons.
Thank you.</i>

14:32.662 --> 14:35.063
It's four beef
and two squab, bitch.

14:35.064 --> 14:37.299
Get it right,
miss know-it-all.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.267
<i>I've told you...
Focus.</i>

14:39.268 --> 14:42.437
Something about this girl Barbie
makes my skin crawl.

14:42.438 --> 14:46.842
And those glasses,
they're, like, fake glasses.

14:46.843 --> 14:48.810
Wake up, guys.
Yes, chef.

14:48.811 --> 14:50.812
Lock it in tight together, yes?

14:50.813 --> 14:52.647
Yes, chef.

14:52.648 --> 14:54.416
Let's go. Run the dishes
through your minds.

14:54.417 --> 14:55.450
Chef, we're gonna
redeem ourselves.

14:55.451 --> 14:56.985
You're gonna what?
Redeem ourselves, chef.

14:56.986 --> 14:58.920
We screwed
up in the first part,

14:58.921 --> 15:01.089
so let's get
our together,

15:01.090 --> 15:02.724
and let's get it back
in the second part.

15:02.725 --> 15:04.659
<i>The swimwear designs
of Amanda Shay.</i>

15:08.865 --> 15:10.665
Hey, baby.
Oh, , man.

15:10.666 --> 15:12.834
Holy .
That is sexy.

15:19.175 --> 15:23.011
How the am I supposed
to cook with that going on?

15:23.012 --> 15:25.046
That's what we're going
to deal with?

15:25.047 --> 15:26.982
<i>Shut the up.
Don't look.</i>

15:26.983 --> 15:29.317
Don't look, guys.

15:29.318 --> 15:31.953
So there's a few boobies and
stuff like that running around.

15:31.954 --> 15:33.221
I see those models, but they're
not gonna distract me.

15:33.222 --> 15:34.823
I'm focused.

15:34.824 --> 15:36.591
Get those beef in the pan
and get 'em seared.

15:36.592 --> 15:38.226
My head is in the steaks.

15:38.227 --> 15:39.327
<i>Hijo la .</i>

15:41.530 --> 15:42.898
<i>Guy, focus.</i>

15:42.899 --> 15:45.166
<i>Guy.</i>

15:45.167 --> 15:46.701
<i>Guy!</i>

15:46.702 --> 15:48.036
<i>Pan's on fire.</i>

15:50.539 --> 15:52.274
<i>charring now.</i>

15:52.275 --> 15:54.776
<i>Look at what the
we're doing here.</i>

15:54.777 --> 15:56.645
It's a filet steak.

15:56.646 --> 15:58.380
<i>Hardly any fat.</i>

15:58.381 --> 16:00.615
So it needs searing beautifully,
but with control.

16:00.616 --> 16:02.751
All Guy had to do

16:02.752 --> 16:04.219
was sear off the beef
and then finish in the oven

16:04.220 --> 16:05.053
and let 'em rest.

16:05.054 --> 16:07.155
So it seems very simple
and basic,

16:07.156 --> 16:07.989
yet he was having
a hard time doing that.

16:07.990 --> 16:09.724
He tuned out.

16:09.725 --> 16:11.426
<i>Show's almost over.</i>

16:11.427 --> 16:12.594
Can we get a grip?

16:12.595 --> 16:13.895
<i>Wake up, you, yeah?</i>

16:13.896 --> 16:15.030
Yes, chef!

16:15.031 --> 16:16.798
While the blue team tries

16:16.799 --> 16:18.099
to focus on the task at hand,

16:18.100 --> 16:19.467
in the dining room,
the last few swimsuit models

16:19.468 --> 16:20.602
hit the runway.

16:20.603 --> 16:22.170
Stand by, ladies, yeah?

16:22.171 --> 16:24.039
And chef Ramsay is counting

16:24.040 --> 16:25.206
on both kitchens
to have entrees ready

16:25.207 --> 16:27.909
as soon as this part
of the show is over.

16:27.910 --> 16:29.744
Three minutes to the window!

16:29.745 --> 16:30.645
Three minutes to window, chef!

16:30.646 --> 16:32.080
<i>Let's go!</i>

16:32.081 --> 16:34.149
No way I'm gonna be three
minutes to the window.

16:34.150 --> 16:36.418
There is a lot of filet
on order.

16:36.419 --> 16:39.120
She's gotta cook
all that she has,

16:39.121 --> 16:41.589
and we better hope
that they come out perfect

16:41.590 --> 16:43.425
because there's no extra.

16:43.426 --> 16:44.426
<i>Just under one minute</i>

16:44.427 --> 16:45.593
<i>to the window.</i>

16:45.594 --> 16:47.162
<i>They're not done yet.
Let's go.</i>

16:47.163 --> 16:48.997
beef, man.
beef.

16:48.998 --> 16:50.131
beef, beef.

16:50.132 --> 16:51.299
<i>The beef's not ready.</i>

16:51.300 --> 16:52.834
<i>He's gonna yell at me.</i>

16:52.835 --> 16:54.002
Oh, my God, oh,
my God, oh, my God.

16:54.003 --> 16:55.870
I'm about to get my ass
handed to me on beef.

16:55.871 --> 16:57.639
Keep 'em in there
as long as possible.

16:57.640 --> 16:58.840
<i>Amanda Shay.</i>

16:58.841 --> 17:00.308
30 seconds to the window.

17:00.309 --> 17:01.810
Yes, chef! Slicing.

17:01.811 --> 17:04.612
Slice it and pray
that it's cooked.

17:04.613 --> 17:06.080
<i>Beef, please.</i>

17:06.082 --> 17:07.781
Beef.

17:07.782 --> 17:09.984
Beef.

17:09.986 --> 17:10.986
Come on, please.

17:12.555 --> 17:13.855
<i>Robyn!
Yes, chef?</i>

17:14.957 --> 17:16.590
That's perfectly cooked,
the beef.

17:16.592 --> 17:17.692
Thank you, chef!

17:17.693 --> 17:20.028
Damn! That's right, son!

17:20.029 --> 17:22.530
The women deliver
the first table of entrees.

17:22.531 --> 17:23.732
Looks delicious.

17:23.733 --> 17:25.400
This is really good.

17:25.401 --> 17:26.768
In the blue kitchen...

17:26.769 --> 17:28.036
Away now, three beef,
six swordfish.

17:28.037 --> 17:31.706
Royce, double-check me.
My all-day on my sword?

17:31.707 --> 17:33.742
17 on the sword.

17:33.743 --> 17:35.677
30 seconds, chef!

17:35.678 --> 17:37.579
Clemenza on
fish and guy on meat...

17:37.580 --> 17:40.081
I'm ready to go
as soon as you tell me.

17:40.082 --> 17:41.649
Appear to be in
sync on the first entrees.

17:41.650 --> 17:43.018
You ready?
Yes, yes, yes.

17:43.019 --> 17:44.652
I got this.

17:44.653 --> 17:46.554
I'm focused, I'm just
right in the zone.

17:46.555 --> 17:47.589
Fish is my thing.

17:47.590 --> 17:49.691
Clemenza... it's his dish,

17:49.692 --> 17:51.993
the pride and joy
of staten island.

17:51.994 --> 17:54.462
So there should be no issue
on the fish side.

17:54.463 --> 17:56.264
<i>Swordfish?
Fish right now.</i>

17:56.265 --> 17:57.932
Right now, here.
Let's go.

17:57.933 --> 17:59.734
Chef, this is hot.
Yeah, I hope it's hot.

17:59.735 --> 18:00.935
It's the kitchen, you doughnut.

18:00.936 --> 18:04.372
Oh, guys.

18:04.373 --> 18:06.374
<i>Hey.</i>

18:06.375 --> 18:08.243
What is this,
a ... hey.

18:08.244 --> 18:09.444
What... what is that?

18:09.445 --> 18:12.080
Rubber, overcooked.

18:12.081 --> 18:13.581
One more swordfish.

18:13.582 --> 18:14.816
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
I got it.

18:14.817 --> 18:16.217
This is Clemenza's dish

18:16.218 --> 18:18.086
on the menu, and it's hard
for him to execute this dish.

18:18.087 --> 18:22.090
I got it, I got it.

18:22.091 --> 18:23.458
I'm dying for a swordfish!

18:23.459 --> 18:25.894
One swordfish right here.

18:25.895 --> 18:27.095
Gimme...

18:27.096 --> 18:28.596
gimme a plate
for the pass, please.

18:28.597 --> 18:30.598
<i>Anybody, somebody.</i>

18:30.599 --> 18:32.801
You know, Clemenza's
like a lost cat sometimes.

18:32.802 --> 18:34.502
He just...
♪ doop de-do de-do ♪

18:34.503 --> 18:35.537
Like, I don't get it.

18:35.538 --> 18:36.504
Right here, right here.

18:36.505 --> 18:37.972
<i>I got it. Hot.</i>

18:37.973 --> 18:39.974
Go, go, go.
It's hot.

18:39.975 --> 18:42.677
I get frazzled.
Everybody gets frazzled.

18:42.678 --> 18:44.212
But you know what?
I got it.

18:44.213 --> 18:47.015
Service, please.

18:47.016 --> 18:48.550
<i>Let's go.</i>

18:48.551 --> 18:49.484
With Clemenza redeeming himself

18:49.485 --> 18:50.885
on the swordfish,

18:50.886 --> 18:53.521
the first order of blue entrees
goes out to the dining room.

18:53.522 --> 18:54.856
Oh, that's really good.

18:54.857 --> 18:56.591
Meanwhile, in the red kitchen,

18:56.592 --> 18:58.693
chef Ramsay is relying
on Robyn...

18:58.694 --> 19:00.028
<i>Away now, Robyn.
Two beef, two pigeon.</i>

19:00.029 --> 19:02.497
<i>Yes, chef.
Two beef, two pigeon.</i>

19:02.498 --> 19:04.799
To keep up the
good work on the meat station.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.534
, my beef's overcooked.

19:06.535 --> 19:09.737
It's over. They're over.
That's well done.

19:09.738 --> 19:12.173
<i>Could someone go ask, see if
the men have any more meat?</i>

19:12.174 --> 19:13.575
How many do you need?

19:13.576 --> 19:14.909
I need two more beef, guys.

19:14.910 --> 19:17.112
. I'm scared.
I don't know.

19:17.113 --> 19:18.947
I was like, "I don't want
to go over there.

19:18.948 --> 19:20.281
I'm scared."

19:20.282 --> 19:21.549
I was scared of chef.

19:24.487 --> 19:27.188
Hold on.

19:27.189 --> 19:29.190
I couldn't do it.
No beef?

19:29.191 --> 19:31.860
Couldn't get over there.
I don't wanna get yelled at.

19:31.861 --> 19:33.761
Someone go get me
another beef, please.

19:33.762 --> 19:35.697
, no. I'm not going over
to the blue kitchen

19:35.698 --> 19:37.732
and get my ass reamed.

19:37.733 --> 19:39.767
So all these girls
on my team talk up the talk,

19:39.768 --> 19:41.703
but they don't back it up.

19:41.704 --> 19:42.871
Get your finger
out of your

19:42.872 --> 19:45.273
and stop being scared.

19:45.274 --> 19:46.674
All right. Start it.
Two?

19:46.675 --> 19:49.157
See if they have two extra.

19:52.882 --> 19:54.282
<i>I need my all-day on sword.</i>

19:54.283 --> 19:55.817
Three beef.
Three beef.

19:55.818 --> 19:57.519
<i>Three beef.</i>

19:57.520 --> 19:59.187
I was looking, and I'm looking,

19:59.188 --> 20:01.089
and I started to go in.

20:01.090 --> 20:02.423
Let's go.

20:02.424 --> 20:04.025
And then here comes
chef Ramsay.

20:04.026 --> 20:06.194
I was like,
"oh, this."

20:06.195 --> 20:07.962
I can't stop their service
to get these beef.

20:07.963 --> 20:08.897
There's no way.

20:08.898 --> 20:10.798
I have overcooked beef,
guys.

20:10.799 --> 20:12.200
I asked.
What?

20:12.201 --> 20:13.501
They won't answer me.

20:13.502 --> 20:14.135
I can't serve this beef.

20:14.136 --> 20:17.372
You better say something.

20:17.373 --> 20:20.241
Yes, chef.
Two beef, two pigeon.

20:20.242 --> 20:22.744
Robyn was, like,
all over the place.

20:22.745 --> 20:24.445
He misses nothing.

20:24.446 --> 20:26.347
Beef... how long?

20:26.348 --> 20:28.816
<i>How long?</i>

20:28.817 --> 20:31.319
<i>How long, Robyn?</i>

20:36.205 --> 20:38.940
It's fashion night
in Hell's Kitchen,

20:38.941 --> 20:40.542
and the models are ready
for the last catwalk.

20:40.543 --> 20:43.478
<i>I need everyone lined up
right now.</i>

20:43.479 --> 20:46.281
But chef Ramsay
won't allow the show to go on

20:46.282 --> 20:48.984
until the last entrees
have been served.

20:48.985 --> 20:51.219
Away now, Robyn,
two beef, two pigeon.

20:51.220 --> 20:53.221
Unfortunately, Robyn,

20:53.222 --> 20:54.990
who started out
so well on meat...

20:54.991 --> 20:57.192
, my beef's overcooked.

20:57.193 --> 20:59.961
<i>Could someone go ask, see if
the men have any more meat?</i>

20:59.962 --> 21:01.496
Finds herself
in a major predicament.

21:01.497 --> 21:02.797
I can't serve this beef.

21:02.798 --> 21:03.832
Better say something.

21:03.833 --> 21:05.500
Beef... how long?

21:05.501 --> 21:08.169
<i>How long, Robyn?</i>

21:08.170 --> 21:09.571
Chef, I have a overcooked beef.

21:09.572 --> 21:13.408
What?

21:13.409 --> 21:15.443
<i>No, that's it.
So any ideas?</i>

21:15.444 --> 21:17.712
I would like to get another beef
from the gentlemen

21:17.713 --> 21:19.347
<i>so I can do it real quick.</i>

21:19.348 --> 21:21.216
<i>Let me tell you something.</i>

21:21.217 --> 21:23.752
We just don't go to the blue
kitchen and get what you want.

21:23.753 --> 21:24.819
<i>It's a competition,
you silly cow.</i>

21:24.820 --> 21:26.421
Okay, yes, chef.

21:26.422 --> 21:28.256
That's the last time
I'm telling you all.

21:28.257 --> 21:28.723
<i>Got it?
Yes, chef.</i>

21:28.724 --> 21:30.125
I am so glad

21:30.126 --> 21:32.627
I didn't get some filets
from the blue kitchen.

21:32.628 --> 21:34.796
I didn't get in trouble.

21:34.797 --> 21:37.565
Get in the dining room.
Get a hold of James urgently.

21:37.566 --> 21:39.000
And tell him you up.

21:39.001 --> 21:40.669
Hurry up!
Okay. Yes, chef.

21:40.670 --> 21:42.771
I guess I'm gonna have to walk
my happy ass

21:42.772 --> 21:45.106
up to table 64 and tell them,

21:45.107 --> 21:47.742
"I'm sorry, ma'am.
We don't have your beef."

21:47.743 --> 21:48.576
<i>Would you like a swordfish
or a pigeon instead?</i>

21:48.577 --> 21:50.078
<i>Yes, pigeon.
Pigeon?</i>

21:50.079 --> 21:50.578
<i>We were talking
about that earlier.</i>

21:50.579 --> 21:51.813
Okay.
Perfect.

21:51.814 --> 21:53.014
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:53.015 --> 21:54.949
They're gonna do a pigeon, sir.

21:54.950 --> 21:56.818
Let's go, let's go.
Three pigeon away.

21:56.819 --> 21:58.687
Yes, chef!

21:58.688 --> 21:59.788
While Robyn gets back to work...

21:59.789 --> 22:01.189
<i>Let's go!</i>

22:01.190 --> 22:03.058
Chef Ramsay now turns

22:03.059 --> 22:04.092
his attention to Tiffany
on the fish station.

22:04.093 --> 22:07.829
Swordfish?
Swordfish, let's go.

22:07.830 --> 22:09.898
Tiff, are you under control?

22:09.899 --> 22:11.466
Um, watch these
while I start the other stuff.

22:11.467 --> 22:12.867
Okay, perfect.

22:12.868 --> 22:14.669
Just make sure
they have nice marks.

22:14.670 --> 22:15.937
<i>I got you.
That's all of 'em.</i>

22:15.938 --> 22:16.738
Throw 'em up there
when you're done.

22:16.739 --> 22:17.605
You got it.

22:17.606 --> 22:19.140
Christina goes over
to help Tiffany

22:19.141 --> 22:20.508
with her swordfish.

22:20.509 --> 22:22.343
It's Tiffany's station.

22:22.344 --> 22:24.212
Give me four to start with,
and then put the rest

22:24.213 --> 22:25.780
on the pan right here.

22:25.781 --> 22:26.414
They'll sit there
until we're ready.

22:26.415 --> 22:28.116
It's all strategy.

22:28.117 --> 22:29.951
She's letting everybody
do the work,

22:29.952 --> 22:31.553
and they're taking the fall.

22:31.554 --> 22:32.587
All right, let's give it
one more turn,

22:32.588 --> 22:34.689
and then out with it.

22:34.690 --> 22:36.758
While Tiffany does
more supervising than cooking,

22:36.759 --> 22:38.660
in the blue kitchen...

22:38.661 --> 22:40.662
Away now, three beef.
How long?

22:40.663 --> 22:41.563
How long for the garnish
for the beef?

22:41.564 --> 22:42.764
Garnish is ready.

22:42.765 --> 22:44.566
Cutting beef.

22:44.567 --> 22:45.734
All eyes are on
Guy on the meat station,

22:45.735 --> 22:48.169
who has
an opportunity to shine.

22:48.170 --> 22:51.206
Beef.

22:51.207 --> 22:52.841
Three beef to the pass.

22:52.842 --> 22:53.908
off, Royce.
Royce, leave me alone.

22:56.812 --> 22:58.413
<i>All of you, come here.</i>

22:58.414 --> 23:00.115
Come here.
The beef's cold.

23:00.116 --> 23:01.816
Look. Just touch it
at the back.

23:01.817 --> 23:02.851
Put your hand on there.

23:02.852 --> 23:04.319
It's not even hot.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.788
It's not cold.
It's warm.

23:06.789 --> 23:08.857
<i>Come on, get it in the oven!</i>

23:08.858 --> 23:09.624
We're making rookie mistakes

23:09.625 --> 23:10.625
at this point.

23:10.626 --> 23:12.327
If you have hands
with nerve endings,

23:12.328 --> 23:14.062
it's very easy to tell
that things are cold.

23:14.063 --> 23:16.030
Can I have the beef hot?
Can I?

23:16.031 --> 23:18.032
Yes, chef.
Very kind of you.

23:18.033 --> 23:19.601
While Guy tries to recover

23:19.602 --> 23:20.635
quickly on meat,
in the red kitchen...

23:20.636 --> 23:24.472
Just give me four.
Yeah.

23:24.473 --> 23:26.474
...cooked by her helper,
Christina...

23:26.475 --> 23:27.542
Behind.

23:27.543 --> 23:29.811
Is ready
for chef Ramsay's approval.

23:29.812 --> 23:32.914
Oh, hell.

23:32.915 --> 23:35.083
All of you, come here.
Just touch that.

23:35.084 --> 23:36.384
Touch it.

23:36.385 --> 23:37.886
They're cold.
Touch it. Cold!

23:37.887 --> 23:41.356
Here, I have an extra one.

23:41.357 --> 23:42.957
Christina grilled it,

23:42.958 --> 23:43.825
but then it's been
sitting there.

23:43.826 --> 23:45.527
Tiffany just brings it
up to the pass.

23:45.528 --> 23:47.428
Well, it's cold!

23:47.429 --> 23:50.365
Who cooked that?

23:50.366 --> 23:52.667
Tiffany's like...

23:52.668 --> 23:54.769
Crickets.

23:54.770 --> 23:56.237
I grilled it and put it
on the resting tray.

23:56.238 --> 23:57.205
You grilled it?

23:57.206 --> 23:59.741
<i>Who's in charge
of the fish?</i>

23:59.742 --> 24:02.610
Tiffany's like,
"wasn't me."

24:02.611 --> 24:04.212
It's your station.

24:04.213 --> 24:08.049
Even if Christina
cooked the swordfish,

24:08.050 --> 24:10.218
it's Tiffany's responsibility.

24:10.219 --> 24:12.487
She shouldn't have sent a cold
swordfish up there anyway.

24:12.488 --> 24:13.655
<i>She cooked it.</i>

24:13.656 --> 24:15.690
I've been bringing it up.

24:15.691 --> 24:17.258
Oh, my gosh.

24:17.259 --> 24:18.860
I'm not sending anything
out of your station

24:18.861 --> 24:20.395
till you say okay.

24:20.396 --> 24:22.430
So you're responsible
for your own station.

24:22.431 --> 24:23.932
What is this?

24:23.933 --> 24:28.460
Tiffany does not want
to take blame

24:28.461 --> 24:29.470
for anything that's her fault.

24:29.471 --> 24:31.005
Swordfish!

24:31.006 --> 24:33.174
Swordfish coming
right now, chef.

24:33.175 --> 24:34.242
She'll throw
anybody under the bus

24:34.243 --> 24:35.310
when she can.

24:35.311 --> 24:36.744
Here you are chef.

24:36.745 --> 24:38.546
It's ugly.
It's fugly.

24:38.547 --> 24:40.048
That's the last one
right there.

24:40.049 --> 24:42.634
<i>Three pigeon... how long?
Got 'em right here, chef.</i>

24:42.635 --> 24:44.085
Finally.

24:44.086 --> 24:46.721
The red team
has successfully delivered

24:46.722 --> 24:47.822
the last of their entrees
to the pass.

24:47.823 --> 24:49.958
So I need one swordfish here.
Finish that.

24:49.959 --> 24:51.392
It's now up to Kimmie,

24:51.393 --> 24:52.594
the designated plater,

24:52.595 --> 24:55.296
to make sure that the dishes
are ready

24:55.297 --> 24:56.598
to head to the dining room.

24:56.599 --> 24:58.199
Oh, , sorry.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.434
<i>That's why the hand
goes underneath.</i>

24:59.435 --> 25:00.435
Sorry.

25:00.436 --> 25:02.871
It's getting hectic.
We're getting down to the wire.

25:02.872 --> 25:04.572
So I am nervous as .

25:04.573 --> 25:05.840
Come on, Kimmie.
Let's go.

25:05.841 --> 25:07.175
<i>Speed up a bit, Kimmie.
Let's go.</i>

25:07.176 --> 25:08.209
<i>Let's go, Kimmie.
Hurry up.</i>

25:08.210 --> 25:10.411
I'm going as fast
as I can, dude.

25:10.412 --> 25:12.146
Where are those fingers?
Let's go. Yes, chef.

25:12.147 --> 25:14.449
<i>Time is of the essence.
Come on, Kimmie.</i>

25:14.450 --> 25:15.884
It takes very graceful hands,

25:15.885 --> 25:17.619
but you have to be fast.

25:17.620 --> 25:19.587
If you're not fast,
then you're .

25:19.588 --> 25:20.588
That's intense up here.

25:20.589 --> 25:24.092
Kimmie.

25:24.093 --> 25:26.127
<i>Uh, nice.
Looks lovely.</i>

25:26.128 --> 25:28.062
<i>Service, please.</i>

25:28.063 --> 25:30.398
With entrees
completed in the red kitchen...

25:30.399 --> 25:32.166
<i>Let's go, clear down.
Yes, chef.</i>

25:32.167 --> 25:34.102
There are only two things

25:34.103 --> 25:34.802
standing in the way
of the final part

25:34.803 --> 25:36.237
of the fashion show...

25:36.238 --> 25:37.538
Where we at?

25:37.539 --> 25:38.339
Going to the pass right now.

25:38.340 --> 25:40.174
Guy's hot beef...

25:40.175 --> 25:41.609
Where's the beef?
It's hot, chef.

25:41.610 --> 25:42.844
I hope it's hot.
Service, please.

25:42.845 --> 25:44.545
And Royce's ability...

25:44.546 --> 25:45.747
Come on, Royce.

25:45.748 --> 25:47.382
You're so awkward.

25:47.383 --> 25:51.819
As a master plater.

25:51.820 --> 25:53.922
Knowing that I can plate
very well

25:53.923 --> 25:55.623
and I do plate up
very beautiful dishes,

25:55.624 --> 25:57.959
it is really
intimidating

25:57.960 --> 25:59.761
with chef Ramsay
right next to me

25:59.762 --> 26:01.396
the whole entire time.

26:01.397 --> 26:02.330
Don't start panicking, Royce.

26:02.331 --> 26:03.331
No.

26:03.332 --> 26:04.699
I am not panicking.

26:04.700 --> 26:06.367
Not with that.
How... blegh.

26:06.368 --> 26:08.303
Sorry, chef.
Hey, come here, you.

26:08.304 --> 26:09.671
Come here.
Come here, you!

26:09.672 --> 26:10.905
I am not panicking!

26:10.906 --> 26:13.708
You're wiping plates with that.

26:13.709 --> 26:17.545
You're wiping plates
in front of our VIP guests,

26:17.546 --> 26:19.347
and there's these
clean cloths here.

26:19.348 --> 26:20.415
Sorry, chef.

26:20.416 --> 26:21.983
And look.
That's it.

26:21.984 --> 26:23.685
Get on the chef table.
off.

26:23.686 --> 26:25.353
<i>Sit down.
Sorry.</i>

26:25.354 --> 26:27.689
off.
Get out.

26:27.690 --> 26:29.324
How dare you?

26:29.325 --> 26:31.326
I made one mistake,
and it was a big mistake,

26:31.327 --> 26:32.927
and, you know, I won't make it
ever again.

26:32.928 --> 26:34.629
And it just brought me
to another level.

26:34.630 --> 26:35.763
Are you ready now,
or are you gonna sit there

26:35.764 --> 26:37.332
like a idiot?
Sorry, chef.

26:37.333 --> 26:38.533
You clean a plate like that
one more time with a dirty rag...

26:38.534 --> 26:39.667
Hey. Hey, big boy.

26:39.668 --> 26:41.169
See that door
out there?

26:41.170 --> 26:41.970
Yes, chef.
Hey, I'll boot you out there.

26:41.971 --> 26:43.204
<i>Sorry, chef.
I swear to God.</i>

26:43.205 --> 26:45.406
I'll push you
through that door.

26:45.407 --> 26:47.275
Service, please.
Go.

26:47.276 --> 26:48.810
Now, with
the entrees complete...

26:48.811 --> 26:50.244
Stoves off, let's go.

26:50.245 --> 26:51.879
It's showtime once again.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.481
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

26:53.482 --> 26:56.247
the evening wear
of David Meister.

27:05.327 --> 27:09.664
<i>Good job tonight, ladies.</i>

27:09.665 --> 27:12.200
Of course we're happy
that we completed service

27:12.201 --> 27:14.068
with all of our team members
still in the kitchen.

27:14.069 --> 27:15.703
Doesn't really erase
the tension

27:15.704 --> 27:17.405
or the kind of divide
that's on our team.

27:17.406 --> 27:18.740
But, to me,

27:18.741 --> 27:20.541
as long as we're
getting it done

27:20.542 --> 27:22.076
in the kitchen for service,

27:22.077 --> 27:23.244
I don't really give a
what happens

27:23.245 --> 27:24.479
outside of those doors.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.447
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, David Meister.</i>

27:29.551 --> 27:31.052
Stoves off.

27:31.053 --> 27:32.720
My station put out
half the dining room.

27:32.721 --> 27:33.454
I give myself credit.

27:33.455 --> 27:34.689
At this moment, yeah,

27:34.690 --> 27:35.857
I am a little proud of myself.

27:35.858 --> 27:37.492
I'm feeling good.

27:37.493 --> 27:41.729
There ain't no
stopping me.

27:41.730 --> 27:44.999
What's all that?
me.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.200
Hey, stop.

27:46.201 --> 27:47.902
<i>Stop, all of you.
All of you!</i>

27:47.903 --> 27:50.304
, man.
Now what?

27:50.305 --> 27:51.539
Who cooked this?

27:51.540 --> 27:53.808
Clemenza, come here, you.

27:53.809 --> 27:56.344
What the have you done?

27:56.345 --> 27:58.780
Oh, no, no, no.

27:58.781 --> 28:01.249
Oh, my God.

28:06.019 --> 28:08.654
<i>The first ever
Hell's Kitchen fashion night</i>

28:08.655 --> 28:09.588
was a success,
but despite the fact

28:09.589 --> 28:11.223
that dinner service is over...

28:11.224 --> 28:12.758
What's all that?

28:12.759 --> 28:13.892
Chef Ramsay has something

28:13.893 --> 28:17.729
important to clear up
between Clemenza and Royce.

28:19.299 --> 28:20.766
Royce, come here, you.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.334
Yes, chef.
It's right up there.

28:22.335 --> 28:23.735
One, two, three,

28:23.736 --> 28:25.504
four, five, six,

28:25.505 --> 28:27.306
<i>seven, eight,</i>

28:27.307 --> 28:30.509
nine, ten, eleven.

28:30.510 --> 28:32.010
Why have you cooked so much?

28:32.011 --> 28:34.346
No idea, chef.

28:34.347 --> 28:36.048
Clemenza.

28:36.049 --> 28:37.816
I called for the all-day.
It was 18, and I did 4 more.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.184
It's not 4 more.
It is 11 more.

28:39.185 --> 28:42.821
You told him 18?

28:42.822 --> 28:45.624
No, I told him...
I told you 16 plus 1.

28:45.625 --> 28:47.059
Okay, 17.

28:47.060 --> 28:49.161
I said, "what the
is 16 plus 1?"

28:49.162 --> 28:51.497
You call 17,
you .

28:51.498 --> 28:54.066
It was 16 orders, plus 1.
That was everything all-day.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.834
But we don't need all these.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.569
I was told 18, chef.

28:57.570 --> 28:58.971
I owned up
to what the I did.

28:58.972 --> 29:00.706
He's with the...

29:00.707 --> 29:02.307
And he wants to talk around
in circles.

29:02.308 --> 29:03.775
Hey, what the 's
the matter with your brain?

29:03.776 --> 29:05.077
This was 18.

29:05.078 --> 29:06.712
I told you exactly 16 plus 1.

29:06.713 --> 29:08.447
And what are we gonna do
with that?

29:08.448 --> 29:09.581
<i>It's another waste.</i>

29:09.582 --> 29:11.416
Go on.
It's another waste, chef.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.918
Go on, here we go.
You love that bin, don't you?

29:12.919 --> 29:14.620
<i>Tell you what.
You hold it up.</i>

29:14.621 --> 29:17.856
You put them in.
Oh, my God.

29:23.129 --> 29:25.898
<i>Hell's Kitchen's
first ever fashion night</i>

29:25.899 --> 29:29.301
wasn't perfect.

29:29.302 --> 29:31.803
It was careless at times.

29:31.804 --> 29:36.023
<i>However, one team
definitely had the edge.</i>

29:36.024 --> 29:40.646
The winning team tonight...
Congratulations...

29:40.647 --> 29:43.115
Red team.

29:43.116 --> 29:45.617
<i>You completed your apps</i>

29:45.618 --> 29:47.986
ten minutes
in front of blue team.

29:51.391 --> 29:53.725
Clemenza...

29:53.726 --> 29:55.627
Our guests hadn't even
sat down,

29:55.628 --> 29:58.630
and you were firing scallops.

29:58.631 --> 29:59.998
<i>Even worse,</i>

29:59.999 --> 30:02.701
that your team
were watching you.

30:02.702 --> 30:04.870
<i>Royce...</i>

30:04.871 --> 30:07.372
I wish you saw Kimmie,
the way she worked... brilliant.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.641
<i>Nailed it.</i>

30:09.642 --> 30:11.944
Blue team.

30:11.945 --> 30:16.315
<i>Come up with two names
ready to leave Hell's Kitchen.</i>

30:16.316 --> 30:18.717
off with you.

30:18.718 --> 30:21.119
<i>Ladies, good job.</i>

30:21.120 --> 30:22.721
Thank you, chef.

30:22.722 --> 30:24.289
Kimmie, nice.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.058
Me and Robyn
are totally cool.

30:26.059 --> 30:28.160
Earlier in the day,
she disrespected me,

30:28.161 --> 30:29.895
but I love the girl to death.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.597
I know she's proud of me.

30:31.598 --> 30:33.198
I mean, friends fight.

30:33.199 --> 30:36.034
I felt like we did
a decent job at service.

30:36.035 --> 30:37.703
You know,
we kept bouncing back.

30:37.704 --> 30:38.804
But I guess the girls

30:38.805 --> 30:40.105
just did better
than us tonight.

30:42.275 --> 30:45.010
I'm feeling really good
right now.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.712
We don't have to deal
with elimination.

30:46.713 --> 30:47.980
Whoop, whoop!

30:47.981 --> 30:49.581
Is there an ice cream
scoop?

30:49.582 --> 30:50.749
Probably in that drawer.

30:50.750 --> 30:52.284
<i>Can we all take a deep breath</i>

30:52.285 --> 30:54.319
and say, ", yeah,
no elimination tonight"?

30:54.320 --> 30:55.420
Yeah!

30:55.421 --> 30:56.922
<i>Do a little chicken dance.</i>

30:59.125 --> 31:01.226
All right, who wants to start?

31:01.227 --> 31:04.663
<i>My first nominee
is gonna be for Clemenza.</i>

31:04.664 --> 31:05.597
No.

31:05.598 --> 31:07.799
No. No way.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.002
Some issues with the scallops.

31:10.003 --> 31:12.804
<i>Clemenza, you're holding us up.</i>

31:12.805 --> 31:14.973
I got six.
I got six on the stove.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.808
Guys, hurry up!
Come on!

31:16.809 --> 31:19.278
<i>I've got to start
the next show.</i>

31:19.279 --> 31:21.413
There's only so many
scallop

31:21.414 --> 31:24.116
I can literally,
physically do at a time.

31:24.117 --> 31:26.518
I'm the easy target,
but I got

31:26.519 --> 31:28.186
half the dinner service
on my shoulder.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.622
<i>I could say,
obviously, Clemenza.</i>

31:30.623 --> 31:32.424
Let's just say
I would've put him

31:32.425 --> 31:35.460
in the corner in kindergarten
for coloring outside the box.

31:35.461 --> 31:36.595
I gotta say Clemenza.

31:37.964 --> 31:40.532
Brian, your nomination?

31:40.533 --> 31:42.467
Clemenza.

31:42.468 --> 31:46.038
That's it.
That's how it works.

31:46.039 --> 31:47.673
I gave him a little spanking.

31:47.674 --> 31:49.074
It's already a majority.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.776
It's already a majority, so...

31:50.777 --> 31:53.245
I don't think I'm the worst chef
on the blue team.

31:53.246 --> 31:57.382
I pulled my weight and then some
on the team.

31:57.383 --> 31:58.617
Second nominee?

31:58.618 --> 32:00.452
Pfft.

32:00.453 --> 32:02.120
me.
I don't know.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.722
It's so difficult, man.

32:03.723 --> 32:06.224
<i>It's a very, very difficult
second pick.</i>

32:06.225 --> 32:08.126
While the blue team digs in

32:08.127 --> 32:09.056
to find a second nominee,

32:11.497 --> 32:13.865
...with her teammate.

32:13.866 --> 32:15.734
Chris.
Yo.

32:15.735 --> 32:17.404
I wanna ask you a question
in private.

32:17.405 --> 32:18.808
'Cause it only refers to you and myself.
Wanna sit down?

32:18.809 --> 32:20.172
No, it's only in regards
to you and myself,

32:20.173 --> 32:22.341
and no one else needs to hear it.
Okay.

32:22.342 --> 32:24.910
I don't know
what Robyn's deal is right now.

32:24.911 --> 32:26.578
We won dinner service,

32:26.579 --> 32:30.682
and she's still
starting .

32:30.683 --> 32:32.384
She just can't help herself.

32:32.385 --> 32:34.886
I was trying to ask
you guys to help.

32:34.887 --> 32:36.888
I knew you guys had it, but I
didn't want to stand there.

32:36.889 --> 32:37.823
I had a problem with Christina
during dinner service.

32:37.824 --> 32:40.025
She wouldn't let me
help her out.

32:40.026 --> 32:41.460
<i>I'll heat it up for you.
You can do that if you want.</i>

32:41.461 --> 32:42.961
No, no, no.
I got it.

32:42.962 --> 32:44.730
Need help over there?

32:44.731 --> 32:46.098
<i>No, no, no.</i>

32:46.099 --> 32:47.766
Dude, I don't know
what to tell you.

32:47.767 --> 32:49.434
What it was is, like,
at that point,

32:49.435 --> 32:51.870
that's when we were, like,
in the thick of it,

32:51.871 --> 32:53.004
it wasn't like, "oh,
I don't want your help."

32:53.005 --> 32:53.839
Like, "You,
I got this."

32:53.840 --> 32:55.507
It was like, "dude,
I'm in a rhythm.

32:55.508 --> 32:57.275
I need to just run with it."
But that's how I felt.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.443
It's definitely nothing
personal, no.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.412
'Cause I noticed it,
like, twice already.

33:00.413 --> 33:01.680
Robyn definitely tends
to take things hard,

33:01.681 --> 33:02.948
take things
a little bit personally.

33:02.949 --> 33:04.616
So I'm definitely
over the drama.

33:04.617 --> 33:05.884
Uh, I just don't need it.

33:05.885 --> 33:07.085
No, it was nothing...

33:07.086 --> 33:08.520
it wasn't anything like that.

33:08.521 --> 33:09.921
Just... I was
in my rhythm, and...

33:09.922 --> 33:12.057
Christina, there's
no "I" in "team".

33:12.058 --> 33:13.458
Next time, have fun trying to
get through service

33:13.459 --> 33:15.222
by yourself.

33:19.132 --> 33:21.099
<i>Who's the second?</i>

33:21.100 --> 33:24.469
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna say Guy.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.171
You know how beef is.

33:26.172 --> 33:29.341
<i>Yeah.
Can be tricksy on you.</i>

33:29.342 --> 33:31.977
Guy, I'm just gonna put
my vote for you.

33:31.978 --> 33:34.479
I see where the wind
is turning.

33:34.480 --> 33:39.718
I have to try to do something
to help me not go up there.

33:39.719 --> 33:41.153
I'll go ahead and tell you.

33:41.154 --> 33:42.154
You wanna go?

33:42.155 --> 33:43.255
It's Brian?

33:43.256 --> 33:45.657
<i>You were right there
next to Clemenza.</i>

33:45.658 --> 33:46.992
You're supposed to help him.

33:46.993 --> 33:49.361
<i>Honestly, the garnish station
should've had the hot pans on</i>

33:49.362 --> 33:51.229
<i>and searing scallops
with Clemenza.</i>

33:51.230 --> 33:52.097
Hold on one second,
all right?

33:53.366 --> 33:55.567
All right, I'm helping
Clemenza the entire time.

33:55.568 --> 33:58.370
You nominate me?
Really?

33:58.371 --> 33:59.871
I helped out

33:59.872 --> 34:01.440
<i>as best as I could!</i>

34:01.441 --> 34:02.974
I'm pissed.

34:02.975 --> 34:06.611
Without my help,
we would've been .

34:06.612 --> 34:07.946
<i>.</i>

34:07.947 --> 34:09.380
<i>Brian!</i>

34:11.261 --> 34:13.529
<i>There's a little bit of luck
for everyone.</i>

34:13.530 --> 34:15.732
After losing dinner service,

34:15.733 --> 34:18.601
the blue team has nominated
Clemenza.

34:18.601 --> 34:19.869
Obviously, Clemenza.

34:19.870 --> 34:22.071
It's already a majority.

34:22.072 --> 34:23.873
As for the second nominee,

34:23.873 --> 34:24.974
guy was a popular choice.

34:24.975 --> 34:26.641
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna say Guy.

34:26.643 --> 34:28.511
You know how beef is.

34:28.512 --> 34:30.346
Can be tricksy on you.

34:30.347 --> 34:32.882
But he wisely
turned the attention

34:32.882 --> 34:34.150
to someone else.

34:34.150 --> 34:35.217
It's Brian?

34:35.219 --> 34:36.886
I helped out

34:36.887 --> 34:38.487
<i>as best as I could.</i>

34:38.489 --> 34:39.589
<i>Brian!</i>

34:41.692 --> 34:44.360
I did what my chef
told me to do.

34:48.665 --> 34:50.400
Does anybody else wanna go?

34:50.400 --> 34:51.400
Here's my thing,
and I'll say this.

34:51.402 --> 34:53.268
Clemenza, what do you got?

34:53.270 --> 34:55.004
I'm obviously not gonna
nominate myself,

34:55.005 --> 34:56.072
<i>although I'm already
the choice candidate.</i>

34:56.072 --> 34:57.807
<i>I don't wanna say you.</i>

34:57.808 --> 35:01.010
But I am, for one reason
and one reason only.

35:01.011 --> 35:03.146
Yes, you helped everybody else.

35:03.147 --> 35:05.648
But as the leader,
as my station's getting hit,

35:05.649 --> 35:07.984
that's where you should've been
for that moment.

35:07.985 --> 35:09.552
I'm irritated with Clemenza.

35:09.553 --> 35:11.287
I ran around like crazy
trying to, you know,

35:11.288 --> 35:13.656
give the support, and I thought
I was being very vocal.

35:13.657 --> 35:15.691
So I think that's .

35:15.692 --> 35:17.060
Maybe I didn't see it. I know
you're giving me that look.

35:17.061 --> 35:18.561
I don't...

35:18.562 --> 35:21.030
if you see me, get someone else
going on scallops.

35:21.031 --> 35:23.900
Get someone else
trying to help me.

35:23.901 --> 35:26.369
But that's not the other
issue, too. The other issue...

35:26.370 --> 35:27.870
You wanna nominate me.
I get it.

35:27.871 --> 35:29.605
If you wanna do that,
that's fine.

35:29.606 --> 35:31.140
Clemenza's got a point.

35:31.141 --> 35:33.409
Patrick is not leading
the blue team.

35:33.410 --> 35:35.445
I don't like a team leader
that don't know how to lead.

35:35.446 --> 35:36.646
You can give me the look
of annoyance

35:36.647 --> 35:37.780
all day long.

35:37.781 --> 35:39.215
It's not a personal thing.

35:39.216 --> 35:40.383
Clemenza,
are you nominating me?

35:40.384 --> 35:41.484
Yeah.

35:43.087 --> 35:46.456
So all we got is Rosh left.

35:46.457 --> 35:48.724
I can't decide
my second nomination.

35:48.725 --> 35:51.527
It's a huge decision.
It's a tough decision.

35:51.528 --> 35:52.528
Rosh.

35:52.529 --> 35:54.163
Uh, um...

35:54.164 --> 35:55.631
Rosh, we need one.

35:55.632 --> 35:57.266
<i>Come on.</i>

35:57.267 --> 35:59.035
Oh, my God.
You guys are killing me.

35:59.036 --> 36:01.938
What the ?
Place a vote.

36:01.939 --> 36:03.706
It's not supposed to be easy.

36:03.707 --> 36:05.041
It's supposed to be difficult.

36:05.042 --> 36:07.110
But you have to be decisive.
You have to.

36:07.111 --> 36:08.778
You have to make a decision
and go with it.

36:08.779 --> 36:10.418
That's it.

36:13.584 --> 36:14.917
me.

36:25.287 --> 36:26.863
Did you have a good discussion?

36:26.864 --> 36:30.032
Yes, chef.

36:30.033 --> 36:31.567
Roshni.

36:31.568 --> 36:32.568
Chef.

36:32.569 --> 36:34.070
First nominee.

36:34.071 --> 36:35.605
The blue team decided
the first nominee

36:35.606 --> 36:38.241
would be Clemenza.

36:38.242 --> 36:39.709
Why?

36:39.710 --> 36:42.345
Based on his performance today
with, uh, the fish station.

36:42.346 --> 36:45.681
<i>That had the main hiccups
of tonight's service.</i>

36:45.682 --> 36:47.483
Second nominee.

36:47.484 --> 36:50.720
<i>Second nominee was very
difficult for us, chef.</i>

36:50.721 --> 36:53.222
Really?

36:53.223 --> 36:55.024
Some of the members of the team

36:55.025 --> 36:57.326
<i>felt that it should be Brian
because he was next to fish.</i>

36:57.327 --> 36:59.362
He should've been able
to help Clemenza out.

36:59.363 --> 37:00.630
Brian.

37:00.631 --> 37:03.199
Yes, chef.

37:03.200 --> 37:06.903
<i>Chef, others voted for Guy.</i>

37:06.904 --> 37:08.337
Guy.

37:08.338 --> 37:09.372
Yes, chef.

37:09.373 --> 37:10.606
So?

37:10.607 --> 37:13.075
Uh...

37:14.978 --> 37:16.078
Come on, then.
Who is it?

37:16.079 --> 37:18.548
Uh...

37:28.594 --> 37:29.428
Although both teams

37:29.429 --> 37:31.663
completed dinner service
tonight,

37:31.664 --> 37:33.698
the red team
earned higher marks,

37:33.699 --> 37:35.800
and the blue team
is left to deliver

37:35.801 --> 37:38.003
two nominees to chef Ramsay
for elimination.

37:38.004 --> 37:41.339
They have already selected...

37:41.340 --> 37:44.042
Clemenza.

37:44.043 --> 37:45.110
Second nominee and why.

37:45.111 --> 37:47.712
Uh...

37:49.782 --> 37:51.283
Come on, then.
Who is it?

37:51.284 --> 37:53.251
<i>Just based on what
held service back twice,</i>

37:53.252 --> 37:56.054
<i>the second nominee...</i>

37:56.055 --> 37:58.623
is Guy.

37:58.624 --> 38:00.292
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

38:00.293 --> 38:01.693
Clemenza, Guy,
step forward, please.

38:01.694 --> 38:03.962
Chef.

38:07.066 --> 38:08.099
Guy.

38:08.100 --> 38:09.467
Yes, chef.

38:09.468 --> 38:11.536
Here you are,
standing in front of me

38:11.537 --> 38:13.538
<i>twice in a row.</i>

38:13.539 --> 38:15.473
<i>Why do you think you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen?</i>

38:15.474 --> 38:17.876
I-I-I'm not done.

38:17.877 --> 38:20.078
<i>I'm the least experienced
one here,</i>

38:20.079 --> 38:22.013
but I-I fight every day.

38:22.014 --> 38:23.748
<i>I have...</i>

38:23.749 --> 38:25.784
Enough fight for...
for five people.

38:25.785 --> 38:28.320
Are you a better chef
than Clemenza?

38:28.321 --> 38:29.754
Clemenza can cook,

38:29.755 --> 38:31.723
but I'm a better chef,
yes, chef.

38:31.724 --> 38:33.191
Clemenza.

38:33.192 --> 38:34.726
<i>Why do you think you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen?</i>

38:34.727 --> 38:37.529
I think I've been an asset to
this team since the beginning.

38:37.530 --> 38:39.564
I've won some challenges.
I-I was...

38:39.565 --> 38:42.901
my dish got
on the menu tonight.

38:42.902 --> 38:44.302
Justin.

38:44.303 --> 38:45.637
Yes, chef.

38:45.638 --> 38:48.540
Who should be going home
tonight?

38:48.541 --> 38:50.075
I would have to say
Clemenza, chef.

38:52.244 --> 38:54.412
Royce, same question.

38:54.413 --> 38:56.414
You know, chef, cle...
uh, Clemenza.

38:56.415 --> 38:58.950
Chef, I've always played 100%.

38:58.951 --> 39:01.219
And even tonight,
I felt like I played 100%.

39:01.220 --> 39:02.687
Patrick.

39:02.688 --> 39:05.957
<i>Who should be going
home tonight?</i>

39:05.958 --> 39:07.359
I'm gonna say Clemenza.

39:07.360 --> 39:10.095
<i>Clemenza.</i>

39:10.096 --> 39:11.096
Roshni.

39:11.097 --> 39:12.297
Clemenza, chef.

39:12.298 --> 39:14.766
<i>Clemenza.
Yes, chef.</i>

39:14.767 --> 39:16.067
Brian.

39:16.068 --> 39:17.602
Clemenza, chef.

39:17.603 --> 39:19.638
Chef, I've chased animals.
I've dug trees.

39:19.639 --> 39:22.307
I gave it my all every, single
time I've been in that kitchen.

39:22.308 --> 39:25.777
I've played 100%,
and I have not once,

39:25.778 --> 39:27.712
not once ever have I stopped

39:27.713 --> 39:29.547
<i>and let my guard down once.</i>

39:29.548 --> 39:31.182
<i>I've tried to help everybody,</i>

39:31.183 --> 39:32.283
do everything, and be every way
that I possibly can be,

39:32.284 --> 39:33.685
and I've always played 100%.

39:33.686 --> 39:34.619
<i>And everybody's trying
to get rid of me.</i>

39:34.620 --> 39:36.655
But you know what?

39:36.656 --> 39:38.156
I still put out better food
than everybody standing there.

39:40.159 --> 39:42.661
<i>Clemenza, I want you to listen
to me carefully.</i>

39:42.662 --> 39:44.162
You've done well.

39:44.163 --> 39:46.297
You had a bad night.

39:46.298 --> 39:49.868
Are you done?

39:49.869 --> 39:51.336
I'm not even close
to done, chef.

39:51.337 --> 39:52.871
I'm ready.

39:52.872 --> 39:54.506
I'll go put out another
dinner service right now

39:54.507 --> 39:55.506
<i>if you need it.</i>

39:56.674 --> 39:58.619
Wow.

39:59.645 --> 40:04.182
Based on everything I've seen,
witnessed...

40:04.183 --> 40:06.628
My decision is...

40:09.672 --> 40:10.798
Clemenza.

40:13.426 --> 40:16.161
Back in line.

40:16.162 --> 40:17.195
Yes!

40:17.196 --> 40:18.663
Uhh!

40:20.332 --> 40:23.034
Guy, your time is up, buddy.

40:23.035 --> 40:26.538
Give me your jacket, please.

40:26.539 --> 40:28.406
Thank you for the opportunity.
Thank you.

40:28.407 --> 40:29.908
Thank you very much.

40:29.909 --> 40:32.010
<i>Thank you for your hard work.</i>

40:35.114 --> 40:37.115
I never thought
that I would be eliminated

40:37.116 --> 40:40.885
this early in the game.

40:40.886 --> 40:43.922
Chef Ramsey definitely made
the wrong decision.

40:43.923 --> 40:46.324
I stand behind everything
that I did,

40:46.325 --> 40:49.260
and I stand behind every dish
that I put out there.

40:49.261 --> 40:50.929
I thought
he would respect that.

40:50.930 --> 40:54.065
Apparently, he doesn't.

40:54.066 --> 40:54.933
Clemenza.

40:54.934 --> 40:56.234
Yes, chef.

40:56.235 --> 40:58.069
You have passion.
Use it.

40:58.070 --> 40:59.471
Yes, chef.

40:59.472 --> 41:01.039
Piss off.

41:02.141 --> 41:03.875
Clemenza?

41:03.876 --> 41:05.777
He has more heart than anyone
on that team.

41:05.778 --> 41:08.279
Clemenza definitely needs
to look after himself

41:08.280 --> 41:09.547
and protect himself.

41:09.548 --> 41:11.149
No one else is going to.

41:11.150 --> 41:13.051
Clemenza's got the biggest
passion in the world.

41:13.052 --> 41:15.420
But at the end of the day,

41:15.421 --> 41:17.188
it takes organization,
skill, and finesse.

41:17.189 --> 41:18.890
Not just passion.

41:18.891 --> 41:20.759
I found out who my friends are,

41:20.760 --> 41:22.861
and obviously, it's no one.

41:22.862 --> 41:23.795
I got more love from the
red team tonight.

41:23.796 --> 41:26.030
Go figure.
If that's how it's gonna be,

41:26.031 --> 41:27.699
that's how it's gonna be.

41:27.700 --> 41:28.333
I'll smile in your face
as I'm taking

41:28.334 --> 41:30.268
the knife outta your back.

41:30.269 --> 41:33.338
<i>Guy's performance
in Hell's Kitchen</i>

41:33.339 --> 41:35.340
was extremely inconsistent.

41:35.341 --> 41:37.742
And that is why I know
he is not the guy

41:37.743 --> 41:39.911
to run Gordon Ramsay Steak.
