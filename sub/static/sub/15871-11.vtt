22:46.933 --> 22:49.533
I THINK IT WAS THE ABSENCE

A HARD EXOSKELETON--

24:13.686 --> 24:15.553
EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY.

WELL, NOTHING SAYS "I LOVE YOU"
LIKE CRABS.

DARLING,
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING SOMEWHERE,

24:30.036 --> 24:31.602
YOU'RE GOING NOWHERE!

24:33.238 --> 24:34.738
SO, WHAT WAS JOSHUA LIKE?

24:34.740 --> 24:35.940
HOW DID IT GO WITH THE LETTER?

24:35.942 --> 24:40.010
HE WAS A BIT,
UNDERSTANDABLY, OVERWHELMED.

24:40.012 --> 24:42.980
HE WASN'T QUITE SURE
HOW TO REACT.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.615
BUT HE WANTS TO FIND HER, RIGHT?

24:44.617 --> 24:46.784
NO.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.686
NOT REALLY, NORMAN.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.254
I'M SORRY.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.156
I KNOW THIS CASE
WAS IMPORTANT TO YOU.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.257
YEAH.

24:53.259 --> 24:54.959
BUT IF IT SETS
YOUR MIND AT EASE,

24:54.961 --> 24:56.026
HE IS SUCCESSFUL.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.261
HE'S A DOCTOR.

24:57.263 --> 24:58.596

24:58.598 --> 24:59.597
HE'S A CARDIO-THORACIC

24:59.599 --> 25:01.532
FELLOW AT DENVER MERCY.

25:01.534 --> 25:03.667
SO HE HAD A HEART CONDITION

25:03.669 --> 25:05.936
AND NOW HE'S A SURGEON THAT
FIXES OTHER PEOPLE'S HEARTS.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.004
THAT'S COOL.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.138
OH! I'VE SEEN
HIS FACE BEFORE.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.040
HE COACHES
THE GIRLS' SOCCER TEAM

25:10.042 --> 25:12.176
THAT WON THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP
LAST YEAR.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.744
I SAW HIS PICTURE

25:13.746 --> 25:15.179
IN "THE HIGH SCHOOL
SPORTS GAZETTE."

25:15.181 --> 25:17.781
THE ARTICLE WAS
"WHEN CHEERLEADERS ATTACK!"

25:17.783 --> 25:20.651
RITA, THAT IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.086
SHE REMEMBERS EVERYTHING
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

25:22.088 --> 25:25.623
RITA, ARE YOU SURE
THAT YOU'RE--

25:25.625 --> 25:26.690
YEAH, RIGHT THERE!
THAT'S HIM!

TO MEET HIS MOTHER, BUT...

25:44.076 --> 25:45.943
OH! MAYBE HE'D WANT TO MEET
HIS BROTHER!

25:52.917 --> 25:56.620
HOW MATT MAY REACT
TO A REVELATION SUCH AS THIS.

33:34.513 --> 33:38.115
NOW, THE FUNNY THING
ABOUT THESE CLOWNS

IS THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW
THAT THEY WERE TRIPLETS.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.521
