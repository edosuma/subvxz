I'm an American.

U.S. Navy SEAL. Let's get
you out of here, Sarah.

00:51.521 --> 00:53.521
[panting, whimpering]

01:28.043 --> 01:29.913
NEWSCASTER: After a week
of recovery and reintegration

01:29.956 --> 01:32.043
at the Landstuhl Medical Center
in Germany,

01:32.086 --> 01:35.173
28-year-old social worker
Sarah Goode is on her way back

01:35.217 --> 01:36.695
to the United States.

01:36.739 --> 01:38.434
When asked,
a State Department spokesperson

01:38.478 --> 01:40.826
would not disclose
her destination.

01:40.869 --> 01:42.913
VANCE: Gibbs, you
mind a visitor?

01:42.956 --> 01:44.347
NEWSCASTER: Before departing,
the former captive had a reunion

01:44.391 --> 01:46.043
with the leader of the Navy SEAL
team that rescued her.

01:46.086 --> 01:49.434
So a happy ending
to a year-long ordeal.

01:51.260 --> 01:53.869
GIBBS: Hey, Leon.VANCE: Hey.

01:53.913 --> 01:56.521
They're bringing
Sarah Goode to Washington.

01:56.565 --> 01:59.217
Putting her up in a hotel.

01:59.260 --> 02:00.869
Henderson at
the State Department

02:00.913 --> 02:02.739
requested our help
debriefing her.

02:02.782 --> 02:05.304
I'd like you
to handle it.

02:05.347 --> 02:06.869
Yeah, sure.

02:06.913 --> 02:08.086
I'll call Henderson
in the morning.

02:08.130 --> 02:09.739
Evidence collected by
the SEAL team

02:09.782 --> 02:12.565
has been sent to our lab
for Ms. Sciuto to analyze.

02:12.608 --> 02:14.478
Nice piece of work.

02:14.521 --> 02:15.913
It's all handmade.
Yeah.

02:15.956 --> 02:17.260
It was Jackie's grandmother's.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.652
She always said
she wanted to give it to Kayla.

02:20.695 --> 02:23.956
You know she's turning 16
next month?

02:26.217 --> 02:28.608
Can you fix that, Gibbs?

02:28.652 --> 02:29.826
Yeah, sure.

02:29.869 --> 02:31.869
Missing a hinge.

02:31.913 --> 02:34.521
Probably pick up one of those
at the flea market on Sunday.

02:34.565 --> 02:37.869
I appreciate any help you can
give me with it, Gibbs.

02:44.695 --> 02:47.043
We're gonna get
the bastard.

02:47.086 --> 02:50.086
You checking up on me, Leon?
I'm fine.

02:52.086 --> 02:53.478
Are you, Gibbs?

02:53.521 --> 02:55.652
Had a chance to kill me,
and he didn't.

02:55.695 --> 02:58.130
'Cause he wants you to
torture yourself like
you're doing right now.

02:58.173 --> 03:00.043
Well, I'm not gonna give him
that satisfaction.

03:01.173 --> 03:04.130
Next time...

03:04.173 --> 03:06.260
wait.
Hmm.

03:06.304 --> 03:10.043
I'm surprised there was no
memorial service for Diane.

03:10.086 --> 03:11.913
Said she never wanted one.

03:11.956 --> 03:13.695
How's Fornell doing?

03:13.739 --> 03:16.565
He's not doing too well.

03:16.608 --> 03:19.695
Took a leave of absence,
get his act together.

03:19.739 --> 03:23.434
Bureau assured him that every
agency is going after Mishnev.

03:23.478 --> 03:25.304
Were he and Diane
gonna get married again?

03:25.347 --> 03:27.565
[sighs]:
Oh, man.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.869
Now he has to raise
a teenage daughter by himself.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.043
What's that?TONY: It's a car magazine.

03:37.086 --> 03:39.391
It's got a review of the new
Corvette I want to read.

03:39.434 --> 03:42.304
I think I just
may treat myself.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.521
I used to have one.

03:43.565 --> 03:44.739
Was my favorite car.

03:44.782 --> 03:46.000
Why'd you sell it?He didn't.

03:46.043 --> 03:47.043
It was stolen and wrecked

03:47.086 --> 03:49.391
during a televised
freeway chase.

03:49.434 --> 03:50.826
Oh.

03:50.869 --> 03:51.869
Yeah.

03:51.913 --> 03:53.260
I'm gonna get coffee.

03:53.304 --> 03:54.608
Get you anything?

03:54.652 --> 03:56.652
I'm-I'm good, thanks.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.782
Okay.

03:58.826 --> 04:01.043
What's going on with Tony?

04:01.086 --> 04:02.608
He's been so mellow lately.

04:04.130 --> 04:07.521
You know what? I bet
he's on a mood stabilizer.

04:10.739 --> 04:12.000
Uh, are you out of your mind?

04:12.043 --> 04:14.000
What? Tony goes through
my drawers all the time.

04:14.043 --> 04:17.000
Besides, something is
going on, I'm telling you.

04:17.043 --> 04:19.478
Yesterday, I locked
the keys in the sedan.

04:19.521 --> 04:21.869
We had to wait an hour for
transpo to come get us.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.565
Normally he'd be
calling me names--

04:23.608 --> 04:26.521
you know, McIdiot, McGoofis,
McDumbell-- but nothing.

04:26.565 --> 04:28.565
Instead, while we
waited, he reminisced

04:28.608 --> 04:30.260
about being a rookie
cop in Philadelphia

04:30.304 --> 04:32.086
and losing the
keys to a sedan.

04:32.130 --> 04:33.913
You're exaggerating.

04:33.956 --> 04:35.347
He's not acting that different.

04:35.391 --> 04:36.478
Oh, I'm exaggerating?

04:36.521 --> 04:37.695
Watch this.[gasps]

04:37.739 --> 04:40.434
No. He's gonna kill you.

04:40.478 --> 04:43.130
GIBBS:
Bishop. Just talked
with Henderson at State.

04:43.173 --> 04:44.826
Our interview with Sarah Goode,
1:00, her hotel.

04:44.869 --> 04:47.086
Yes, sir. We just did
some background work on her.

04:47.130 --> 04:49.695
She was a volunteer, working
at an orphanage in Syria,

04:49.739 --> 04:51.478
when she was taken
by the terrorists.

04:53.304 --> 04:55.913
I'm begging the U.S. government.

04:55.956 --> 04:58.304
Please give them the money
that they're asking for

04:58.347 --> 04:59.826
so I can get home.

04:59.869 --> 05:02.695
If you don't,
they're gonna kill me.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.478
Please.

05:05.521 --> 05:07.608
BISHOP:
Kidnappers were
demanding $100 million.

05:07.652 --> 05:10.956
But, per U.S. policy,
ransoms aren't paid.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
They didn't figure on
SEALs spoiling their plan.

05:16.782 --> 05:18.695
[laughs] Oh, hey.

05:18.739 --> 05:21.173
What happened here?Oh. Sorry about
that, Tony.

05:21.217 --> 05:23.521
Your phone was ringing.
I went to go answer it,

05:23.565 --> 05:24.739
and I-I spilled
my coffee.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.086
[phone ringing]Well, accidents happen.

05:27.130 --> 05:29.565
GIBBS:
Yeah, Abbs.

05:29.608 --> 05:30.913
I'm on the way down.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.347
McGee, thanks for trying
to get that call.

05:33.391 --> 05:35.391
I'm just gonna get
some paper towels.

05:38.521 --> 05:39.565
Who is that guy?

05:39.608 --> 05:41.695
You're right.
That was very un-Tony.

05:41.739 --> 05:43.739
[elevator bell dings]

05:44.913 --> 05:47.652
Whoa. Abbs, what's
got you so excited?

05:47.695 --> 05:49.782
The evidence
that the Navy SEALs collected

05:49.826 --> 05:51.869
and sent back suggests
there was another terrorist,

05:51.913 --> 05:53.217
one we didn't know about.

05:53.260 --> 05:54.913
How do you know?

05:54.956 --> 05:57.565
I found fingerprints on this
rifle that don't belong to any

05:57.608 --> 05:59.521
of the terrorists killed
in the raid.
You got a match.

05:59.565 --> 06:01.695
Why else would I
bring you down here?

06:01.739 --> 06:03.086
Special Agent Gibbs,

06:03.130 --> 06:06.130
meet Kyle Nasry.

06:06.173 --> 06:07.695
Maryland driver's license.

06:07.739 --> 06:09.739
I thought you'd find
that interesting.

06:09.782 --> 06:13.000
Gibbs, his prints
were on the weapon.

06:13.043 --> 06:15.652
Definitely not
a hostage.

06:15.695 --> 06:18.695
It looks like one of Sarah
Goode's captors was an American.

06:37.782 --> 06:40.391
TONY:
Interestingly,
Kyle Nasry's father

06:40.434 --> 06:42.043
was born in Aleppo, Syria,

06:42.086 --> 06:44.043
immigrated to
the United States as a boy

06:44.086 --> 06:46.695
and passed away
when Kyle was only 12.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.043
His mother is an American,
she's a grade-school teacher,

06:49.086 --> 06:51.608
and she still lives in their
family home in Olney, Maryland.

06:51.652 --> 06:54.000
Kyle graduated from
Morgan State University,

06:54.043 --> 06:55.956
where he majored in
environmental science.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.478
McGEE:
Only thing of note
on his record:

06:57.521 --> 06:59.173
Nasry was arrested
in D.C. during

06:59.217 --> 07:02.652
the 2010 protest against the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

07:02.695 --> 07:05.304
He was investigated and cleared
by the FBI.

07:05.347 --> 07:07.304
Now he's with terrorists
in Syria.

07:07.347 --> 07:08.521
All right, it's almost 1:00.

07:08.565 --> 07:10.434
We have an interview
with Sarah Goode.

07:10.478 --> 07:11.695
Hopefully she knows
something.

07:11.739 --> 07:13.086
DiNozzo, take McGee,

07:13.130 --> 07:15.608
go to Olney,
talk to Nasry's mother.

07:21.217 --> 07:24.521
This is a radical change
from the windowless room

07:24.565 --> 07:26.347
I lived in
for the last ten months.

07:26.391 --> 07:31.086
I began to think that I'd never
make it out of there alive.

07:31.130 --> 07:32.826
The State Department's
been great.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.086
Putting me up here.

07:35.130 --> 07:38.043
But I know I can't stay forever.

07:38.086 --> 07:39.173
Family?

07:39.217 --> 07:41.913
Unfortunately, none.

07:41.956 --> 07:43.565
I'm an orphan myself.

07:43.608 --> 07:45.391
That's why I work with
homeless children.

07:45.434 --> 07:47.304
How'd you end up in Syria?

07:47.347 --> 07:52.043
Well, um, after high school,
I started working day care jobs.

07:52.086 --> 07:55.347
And then this opportunity
came up to join

07:55.391 --> 07:57.391
an international relief agency

07:57.434 --> 07:59.521
that worked with children
orphaned by the war there.

07:59.565 --> 08:02.826
It was very rewarding.

08:02.869 --> 08:04.565
Until the day I was

08:04.608 --> 08:07.782
traveling to another village
to pick up a child

08:07.826 --> 08:12.434
and I was stopped at a roadblock
and, uh, taken captive.

08:15.652 --> 08:18.652
You know this man?

08:20.434 --> 08:23.434
No.

08:23.478 --> 08:24.826
We believe he was
working with the terrorists

08:24.869 --> 08:26.217
who were holding you in Syria.

08:26.260 --> 08:28.043
His name's Kyle Nasry.

08:28.086 --> 08:29.260
He's an American.

08:30.434 --> 08:31.956
Sorry.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
I was isolated

08:35.043 --> 08:37.347
and only dealt with
a limited number of people.

08:37.391 --> 08:40.478
Men.

08:40.521 --> 08:42.130
They always wore hoods.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.434
Any of them speak English?

08:43.478 --> 08:45.347
No.

08:45.391 --> 08:48.521
I mean, not more than
a few words.

08:48.565 --> 08:50.086
Was this man killed in the raid?

08:50.130 --> 08:51.565
No.

08:51.608 --> 08:53.347
State Department said
you've turned down requests

08:53.391 --> 08:55.043
from the media for interviews.

08:55.086 --> 08:57.304
Yeah, that's just not me.

08:57.347 --> 08:59.913
I've never liked
being in the spotlight.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.521
For the moment,
I would just like to lay low.

09:02.565 --> 09:06.043
The, um... the only
thing I'd like to do

09:06.086 --> 09:08.652
before I leave Washington

09:08.695 --> 09:12.782
is to hear Musa ibn Hasan.

09:12.826 --> 09:15.043
The Imam's in town
to give a speech.

09:15.086 --> 09:19.000
His stand against religious
extremism and jihadist violence

09:19.043 --> 09:20.173
truly represents the beliefs

09:20.217 --> 09:21.869
of the Muslims
that I knew in Syria.

09:21.913 --> 09:23.521
Unfortunately,

09:23.565 --> 09:27.043
a radical mufti issued a fatwa
demanding Hasan's execution.

09:27.086 --> 09:28.478
So where do you go from here?

09:28.521 --> 09:30.521
I know it sounds crazy,

09:30.565 --> 09:34.434
but I would like to go back
to Syria.

09:34.478 --> 09:36.043
Back to the orphanage.

09:36.086 --> 09:38.869
There are so many children
who need help there.

09:40.913 --> 09:44.130
But I-I know I can't go back
until the country's stabilized.

09:44.173 --> 09:46.347
MAN:
Disaffected young
Western males,

09:46.391 --> 09:49.304
here and in Europe, are targeted
by terrorist recruiters.

09:49.347 --> 09:53.217
Most are troubled kids seeking
redemption and violent action.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.043
And they buy into jihad.

09:55.086 --> 09:58.391
Media-savvy militants in Iraq
and Syria post graphic photos

09:58.434 --> 10:00.956
and slick recruitment videos
on Facebook and Twitter.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.565
Reach right into
a kid's bedroom.

10:02.608 --> 10:04.608
Parents have no idea
what's going on.

10:04.652 --> 10:08.304
This is Cleavon Smith,
a former Detroit gang member,

10:08.347 --> 10:12.434
born-again Muslim, who was known
as Abu Hussein when he died

10:12.478 --> 10:15.347
last week on the killing fields
of Syria's civil war.

10:15.391 --> 10:17.086
Do we know how many Americans
are fighting in Syria?

10:17.130 --> 10:20.086
About a dozen, and we can
stop them from returning.

10:20.130 --> 10:22.347
It's the ones we don't know
about that are the concern.

10:22.391 --> 10:24.695
Like this guy Nasry
you've uncovered.

10:24.739 --> 10:27.000
What else do you know about him?

10:27.043 --> 10:28.347
Your lab turn up anything else?

10:28.391 --> 10:29.695
Not yet.

10:29.739 --> 10:31.304
Our forensic scientist
is working on

10:31.347 --> 10:33.521
the computer files
that the SEALs brought back.

10:33.565 --> 10:35.086
And Nasry's been put
on the no-fly list.

10:35.130 --> 10:37.130
We'll keep you
posted, Director.

10:55.217 --> 10:56.260
Mrs. Nasry?

10:56.304 --> 10:58.000
Yes?

10:58.043 --> 11:01.391
NCIS Special Agents DiNozzo
and McGee.

11:01.434 --> 11:02.782
NCIS?

11:02.826 --> 11:05.043
Oh, you guys are great.

11:05.086 --> 11:06.391
One of your agents,

11:06.434 --> 11:07.739
Ned Dorneget,

11:07.782 --> 11:09.782
spoke to my seventh-graders
on Career Day.

11:09.826 --> 11:11.347
Hmm.

11:11.391 --> 11:13.391
What are you doing here?

11:13.434 --> 11:15.782
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about your son, Kyle.

11:15.826 --> 11:17.304
Kyle's not here.

11:17.347 --> 11:19.347
He's traveling in Greece.

11:19.391 --> 11:20.739
Why don't we talk inside?

11:20.782 --> 11:22.913
McGEE:
We have reason to believe

11:22.956 --> 11:25.782
that Kyle has aligned himself
with jihadist terrorists.

11:27.043 --> 11:28.565
No, no.

11:28.608 --> 11:31.478
That's-that's not possible.

11:31.521 --> 11:34.173
We know his father
was born in Syria.

11:34.217 --> 11:37.130
Yes, but he came
to America as a young boy.

11:37.173 --> 11:39.608
My husband wasn't religious
or political.

11:39.652 --> 11:41.304
Kyle went

11:41.347 --> 11:42.913
to an Episcopal High School.

11:42.956 --> 11:44.956
Where he played football.Yes.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.521
How do you know
he's in Syria?

11:47.565 --> 11:49.347
When was the last time
you heard from him?

11:51.391 --> 11:53.217
A week or two ago.

11:53.260 --> 11:55.000
We exchange e-mails.

11:55.043 --> 11:57.000
Who's the young lady
in the photograph?

11:57.043 --> 11:59.130
It's Chelsea, his girlfriend.

11:59.173 --> 12:01.869
That was taken right before they
left for Europe last summer.

12:01.913 --> 12:03.956
Have you heard from her?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.391
She came home.

12:05.434 --> 12:08.043
They broke up.

12:08.086 --> 12:09.304
You know how we can get
ahold of her?

12:09.347 --> 12:11.782
I have her cell number.

12:17.043 --> 12:18.347
[door hissing open]

12:18.391 --> 12:19.869
[elevator bell dings]

12:19.913 --> 12:23.086
This is an excellent
debriefing report, Eleanor.

12:23.130 --> 12:25.173
The State Department
should be pleased.

12:25.217 --> 12:26.434
Thanks.

12:26.478 --> 12:29.826
But you appear concerned.

12:29.869 --> 12:32.260
I am. That's why I asked you
to review it.

12:32.304 --> 12:34.391
I feel like I missed something.

12:34.434 --> 12:36.043
Oh?Sarah Goode is...

12:36.086 --> 12:37.434
incredible.

12:37.478 --> 12:38.782
I mean, after everything
she's been through,

12:38.826 --> 12:41.173
she's handling it so well.

12:41.217 --> 12:44.130
And your concern is?

12:44.173 --> 12:46.173
It's all gonna hit her later.

12:46.217 --> 12:47.391
Well, some people don't begin

12:47.434 --> 12:50.086
to experience the symptoms
until later.

12:50.130 --> 12:53.956
It's called delayed-onset
post traumatic stress disorder,

12:54.000 --> 12:55.130
and it affects almost

12:55.173 --> 12:58.043
a quarter of PTSD cases.

12:58.086 --> 13:01.478
Sarah wants to go
back to the orphanage in Syria.

13:01.521 --> 13:03.826
That would be a big mistake.

13:03.869 --> 13:05.260
It could trigger...

13:05.304 --> 13:07.391
A breakdown.

13:07.434 --> 13:09.434
Yeah.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.217
[sighs]

13:13.260 --> 13:15.869
[whistling]

13:15.913 --> 13:19.086
Hey, you haven't said a word
to me since we left the office.

13:19.130 --> 13:21.086
I've been trying to figure
out what you're up to.

13:21.130 --> 13:22.478
Me?

13:22.521 --> 13:23.739
Yeah.

13:23.782 --> 13:25.304
You've been acting so...

13:25.347 --> 13:27.043
you know, nice.

13:27.086 --> 13:28.782
[blow-dryer whirring]You haven't abused me in days.

13:28.826 --> 13:31.434
Oh, well, if you would
like me to abuse you,

13:31.478 --> 13:33.130
I will abuse you.

13:33.173 --> 13:36.043
Come on, let's go.

13:36.086 --> 13:39.130
[blow-dryer stops]Geez, look at this thing.

13:39.173 --> 13:40.869
[dog barking]
WOMAN:
Uh, it's open.

13:40.913 --> 13:42.521
Whoa![growls]

13:42.565 --> 13:44.043
Hi.
Chelsea, hi.

13:44.086 --> 13:45.347
I'm Special Agent DiNozzo.

13:45.391 --> 13:48.652
This is McGee from NCIS.
We called earlier.

13:48.695 --> 13:52.173
Yeah, you did not sound
so cute on the phone. [chuckles]

13:52.217 --> 13:55.043
[chuckles]

13:55.086 --> 13:56.347
Um, I'm running late
with Tiffany, so if we could...

13:56.391 --> 13:58.043
Tiffany?

13:58.086 --> 14:01.043
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Are you Tiffany?[barks]

14:01.086 --> 14:02.695
Whoa!
Sorry.

14:02.739 --> 14:04.826
Oh, it's okay.Uh, just so you guys know,

14:04.869 --> 14:06.652
I haven't seen
or spoken to Kyle in months.

14:06.695 --> 14:08.130
Well, his mother said

14:08.173 --> 14:11.043
that you two broke up
while you were in Europe?

14:11.086 --> 14:13.000
Yeah.There a reason?

14:13.043 --> 14:15.217
He started acting strange.

14:15.260 --> 14:19.000
Um, you think
you know someone, but...

14:20.826 --> 14:22.086
He began hanging out

14:22.130 --> 14:23.391
with people that I didn't like.

14:23.434 --> 14:25.043
Hmm. What was wrong
with them?

14:25.086 --> 14:27.043
They were negative,

14:27.086 --> 14:29.043
against everything,

14:29.086 --> 14:30.782
a radical, extremist crowd.

14:30.826 --> 14:32.043
I had had enough.

14:32.086 --> 14:33.782
Kyle and I began arguing
so much.

14:33.826 --> 14:35.652
I left.

14:37.086 --> 14:39.173
Do you have a dog?

14:39.217 --> 14:40.565
Oh, no.

14:40.608 --> 14:42.043
I had a cat; it ran away.

14:42.086 --> 14:44.043
I have two goldfish.

14:44.086 --> 14:46.173
Oh, well,
who takes care of them for you?

14:47.434 --> 14:48.869
Oh, they...

14:48.913 --> 14:50.434
they're just in their bowl.

14:51.782 --> 14:53.652
Sort of take care of themselves.

14:53.695 --> 14:56.043
Thank you.

14:56.086 --> 14:57.782
McGEE:
You're seeing someone.

14:57.826 --> 15:00.130
[chuckles] I wish.

15:00.173 --> 15:01.304
Oh, please, come on.

15:01.347 --> 15:03.130
Dog lady was hitting
on you like crazy.

15:03.173 --> 15:04.521
She's super cute and...

15:04.565 --> 15:06.652
22 years old.

15:06.695 --> 15:08.043
Since when has that
ever stopped you?

15:08.086 --> 15:10.043
VANCE:
We got a call from Homeland.

15:10.086 --> 15:13.260
Kyle Nasry's passport cleared
Customs at Dulles two days ago.

15:13.304 --> 15:15.826
Our worst fear,
a homegrown terrorist

15:15.869 --> 15:17.043
back on U.S. soil.

15:35.304 --> 15:38.086
This was taken at the airport
the day before yesterday,

15:38.130 --> 15:40.043
and that is Nasry.

15:40.086 --> 15:42.086
Camera also picked him up.
on an escalator

15:42.130 --> 15:43.043
Lost him after that.

15:43.086 --> 15:44.782
No sight of him curbside.

15:44.826 --> 15:46.347
All the intelligence
and law enforcement agencies

15:46.391 --> 15:47.608
have been alerted.

15:47.652 --> 15:49.173
[elevator bell dings]Boss.

15:51.478 --> 15:54.000
[elevator bell dings]

15:54.043 --> 15:56.000
[sighs]

15:58.086 --> 16:00.608
Fornell.

16:00.652 --> 16:02.260
How you doing, man?

16:02.304 --> 16:05.260
Uh, I'm okay, DiNozzo.

16:09.043 --> 16:10.130
Oh.

16:10.173 --> 16:12.217
I was working
undercover before...

16:12.260 --> 16:13.956
Uh, Agent Fornell,

16:14.000 --> 16:15.826
I'm so sorry for your loss.

16:15.869 --> 16:16.869
Thank you.

16:16.913 --> 16:18.173
How's your daughter?

16:18.217 --> 16:20.130
It's been tough for her.

16:20.173 --> 16:22.000
Diane's mother
is trying to help.

16:22.043 --> 16:23.347
Tobias,

16:23.391 --> 16:24.826
you have my condolences.

16:24.869 --> 16:26.000
Thanks, Tim.

16:26.043 --> 16:27.434
Diane was very fond

16:27.478 --> 16:29.434
of you.

16:29.478 --> 16:31.000
I know you two were close.

16:32.217 --> 16:34.043
We weren't that close.

16:36.434 --> 16:38.173
Tobias?

16:38.217 --> 16:39.434
What are you doing here?

16:39.478 --> 16:40.956
Kyle Nasry.

16:42.173 --> 16:43.826
Yeah, what about him?

16:43.869 --> 16:45.000
In 2010,
I personally investigated

16:45.043 --> 16:47.521
and cleared him
of criminal intent

16:47.565 --> 16:50.347
in a protest against the wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

16:50.391 --> 16:51.608
Look at him now.

16:51.652 --> 16:53.347
TONY:
Well, that was years ago.

16:53.391 --> 16:55.043
People change.
Don't blame yourself.

16:55.086 --> 16:57.130
Special Agent McGee.FORNELL: No, he was
looking for a cause.

16:57.173 --> 16:59.130
No indications he'd go further.
I screwed up.

16:59.173 --> 17:00.695
I didn't put him
on a watch list.

17:00.739 --> 17:02.391
Boss,

17:02.434 --> 17:03.869
Nasry's mother's here.

17:03.913 --> 17:04.913
She's waiting
in the conference room.

17:04.956 --> 17:06.391
GIBBS:
Call you later, all right?

17:08.652 --> 17:09.869
Where you going?

17:09.913 --> 17:11.217
Help you interview the mother.

17:11.260 --> 17:12.608
Nasry's a civilian,

17:12.652 --> 17:15.869
a suspected terrorist
on U.S. soil.

17:15.913 --> 17:17.347
That sounds like
FBI jurisdiction to me.

17:17.391 --> 17:18.869
You took a leave of absence.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.000
I got to get my mind
off Diane.

17:20.043 --> 17:21.826
Get back to work.

17:21.869 --> 17:23.608
I'm going crazy in the house.

17:23.652 --> 17:25.260
Dealing
with a grief-stricken,

17:25.304 --> 17:27.434
hormonal teenage daughter

17:27.478 --> 17:29.173
and Diane's mother.
You remember Mo?

17:29.217 --> 17:30.913
Oh, yeah.She was your mother-in-law, too.

17:30.956 --> 17:32.130
Yeah, hard to forget.

17:33.173 --> 17:34.478
[sighs]

17:36.260 --> 17:37.565
Okay.

17:38.826 --> 17:40.130
MRS. NASRY:
I e-mailed Kyle

17:40.173 --> 17:42.956
that I wanted
to meet him in Athens

17:43.000 --> 17:44.782
over Christmas break,

17:44.826 --> 17:48.521
and he had all kinds of reasons
why I shouldn't come.

17:48.565 --> 17:50.000
[sighs]

17:50.043 --> 17:51.391
Now it makes sense.

17:51.434 --> 17:53.521
He wasn't there.

17:53.565 --> 17:55.956
We believe he's now back
in Washington.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.130
No, he-he would've called me.

17:59.173 --> 18:00.869
I understand a parent
protecting their child.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.173
I also know personally

18:03.217 --> 18:05.869
there's added pressure
on a single parent,

18:05.913 --> 18:07.521
but if you've heard from Kyle

18:07.565 --> 18:10.391
or if he tries to contact you,
you have to tell us.

18:10.434 --> 18:11.739
I haven't heard from him.

18:11.782 --> 18:12.739
I know Kyle

18:12.782 --> 18:14.130
was political,

18:14.173 --> 18:16.217
but he would never
do anything evil.

18:16.260 --> 18:18.217
Can you think of anyone he might
try to contact? A friend,

18:18.260 --> 18:20.347
a relative?Or someplace he might go?

18:20.391 --> 18:22.608
[knocking on door]

18:22.652 --> 18:24.565
Gibbs, I need to talk to you.

18:24.608 --> 18:27.000
Oh.

18:28.260 --> 18:29.782
Um...

18:29.826 --> 18:31.869
Abby?

18:31.913 --> 18:33.086
We're in the middle
of an interview.

18:33.130 --> 18:34.304
Mm.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.217
Abbs, what is it?[elevator bell dings]

18:36.260 --> 18:39.565
I was reconstructing
an external laptop drive

18:39.608 --> 18:41.782
the SEALs brought in.
It was damaged in the raid.

18:41.826 --> 18:43.782
Yeah, but you were able
to recover some information?

18:43.826 --> 18:45.869
Um, no, not yet. Be patient.

18:45.913 --> 18:47.347
There's something else
I want to show you.

18:47.391 --> 18:49.434
I tested its cover
for touch DNA.

18:49.478 --> 18:51.000
It only requires seven
to eight cells

18:51.043 --> 18:52.913
from the outermost layer
of human skin

18:52.956 --> 18:55.000
when an object is touched
or casually handled.

18:55.043 --> 18:56.000
And you got a hit.
Yes.

18:56.043 --> 18:57.652
From the FBI's

18:57.695 --> 18:59.434
biometric database.

18:59.478 --> 19:01.565
You're welcome.

19:02.869 --> 19:04.521
There was another American

19:04.565 --> 19:07.043
working with the terrorist
who were holding Sarah Goode.

19:11.304 --> 19:12.782
BISHOP:
Randall White

19:12.826 --> 19:15.043
served with the U.S. Army
in Afghanistan.

19:15.086 --> 19:18.695
Bad conduct discharge is 2010
for insubordination.

19:18.739 --> 19:21.217
TONY:
In 2011, he was arrested
along with other gangmembers

19:21.260 --> 19:22.826
for aggravated assault

19:22.869 --> 19:24.043
in Newark, New Jersey.

19:24.086 --> 19:25.478
Copped a plea,

19:25.521 --> 19:27.304
served six months,
got two years probation,

19:27.347 --> 19:29.391
and that is how he found his way

19:29.434 --> 19:30.913
onto the FBI database.

19:30.956 --> 19:33.043
If Nasry's back in country,
White could be, too.

19:33.086 --> 19:35.000
I'll check Customs and TSA.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.739
TONY:
One other thing:
while in prison,

19:36.782 --> 19:38.391
White converted to Islam.

19:38.434 --> 19:39.869
His last known whereabouts
was in Turkey

19:39.913 --> 19:41.434
over a year ago.

19:41.478 --> 19:43.130
He obviously made
his way into Syria.

19:43.173 --> 19:44.652
There could be others.

19:44.695 --> 19:47.434
Holy crap.

19:47.478 --> 19:50.130
White's passport
was scanned by Customs

19:50.173 --> 19:51.695
at the Dulles International
Arrivals Building

19:51.739 --> 19:52.739
15 minutes ago.

19:52.782 --> 19:53.869
He could still be
at the airport.

19:53.913 --> 19:55.826
I'll alert TSA, airport police.

19:55.869 --> 19:58.130
Airport security cameras, Tim.I'll work from MTAC.

19:58.173 --> 19:59.608
DiNozzo, get the car.

19:59.652 --> 20:00.608
Bishop, come on.

20:00.652 --> 20:01.869
Let's go. You're with us.

20:01.913 --> 20:04.695
We looking for beards here?

20:04.739 --> 20:05.869
If Walker's
a full-blown jihadist,

20:05.913 --> 20:07.130
he might have grown one.

20:07.173 --> 20:08.782
I hope not.

20:08.826 --> 20:10.956
It'd cover
half the facial markers.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.869
BISHOP:
White's parents live
in California.

20:12.913 --> 20:14.478
Right out of high school,
he went to Fort Sill

20:14.521 --> 20:16.217
in Oklahoma for basic training.

20:16.260 --> 20:18.086
An ex-girlfriend
and seven-year-old son

20:18.130 --> 20:20.739
he doesn't support still live
just off the base.

20:20.782 --> 20:22.130
Guy's a real winner.He doesn't appear

20:22.173 --> 20:24.304
to have a connection
to anyone in the D.C. area.

20:24.347 --> 20:25.739
Well, it can't be
a coincidence

20:25.782 --> 20:27.130
that he and Nasry
are both here now.

20:27.173 --> 20:28.304
Something's going down.

20:28.347 --> 20:30.521
[phone ringing]

20:32.826 --> 20:33.913
It's that...
it's that one there.

20:33.956 --> 20:35.521
Hello?

20:35.565 --> 20:37.652
McGEE:
All right, we got him.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.652
White got in a Downtown D.C. cab
about 16 minutes ago.

20:39.695 --> 20:41.652
I got the cab number.

20:41.695 --> 20:43.086
I'll alert
Virginia State Police and Metro.

20:43.130 --> 20:44.347
GIBBS:
Hold off.

20:44.391 --> 20:45.652
Maybe he'll lead us to Nasry.

20:45.695 --> 20:46.913
That's risky, Gibbs.

20:46.956 --> 20:48.000
McGEE:
You know, their cabs
are all equipped

20:48.043 --> 20:49.695
with GPS.
I can call the dispatcher.

20:49.739 --> 20:51.217
He can track it.

20:51.260 --> 20:53.217
Do it.

20:55.260 --> 20:56.826
Where you fly in from?

20:56.869 --> 20:59.043
How far away are we
from the hotel?

20:59.086 --> 21:02.347
Whew, in this traffic,
about ten, 15 minutes.

21:02.391 --> 21:03.695
They're on 66th,

21:03.739 --> 21:05.782
about to cross
the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge.

21:05.826 --> 21:07.217
GIBBS:
Ask the dispatcher
to call his driver.

21:07.260 --> 21:08.869
Get White's destination.

21:08.913 --> 21:10.739
[phone ringing]

21:10.782 --> 21:13.000
Go ahead, Alex.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.478
Uh, Chesterfield Hotel.

21:17.826 --> 21:20.521
Boss, he's headed
towards the Chesterfield Hotel.

21:22.086 --> 21:24.304
[tires squealing]

21:36.695 --> 21:38.043
It's me.

21:38.086 --> 21:40.173
Leave now.

21:40.217 --> 21:41.347
Pull over.

21:41.391 --> 21:42.956
Let me out here.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.956
Oh, you're just ten blocks
from the hotel still.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.347
That's okay.

21:49.782 --> 21:52.608
Cab stopped in the middle
of the block.

21:52.652 --> 21:53.565
Could be traffic.

21:53.608 --> 21:55.608
[horn honks]

21:57.782 --> 21:58.782
Thank you for your help, Alex.

21:58.826 --> 22:00.739
Okay.

22:00.782 --> 22:02.869
Dispatcher said that White
made the cabbie pull over.

22:02.913 --> 22:04.391
He got out.

22:04.434 --> 22:05.391
Where?

22:05.434 --> 22:06.695
On 12th Street,
between C and D.

22:06.739 --> 22:08.000
Okay. We're close.

22:36.695 --> 22:38.434
[tires squealing]

22:40.478 --> 22:42.956
[tires screeching]

22:43.000 --> 22:44.652
Show me your hands!

22:44.695 --> 22:45.913
Federal agents!Stop!

22:47.521 --> 22:48.565
No, no!

23:20.043 --> 23:21.434
[siren chirps]Heard about plastic guns.

23:21.478 --> 23:22.869
First one I've ever seen.

23:22.913 --> 23:24.304
Well, the technology
obviously works.

23:24.347 --> 23:26.000
White got it through
airport security.

23:26.043 --> 23:27.173
McGEE:
Three airports.

23:27.217 --> 23:28.478
I just downloaded
his flight information.

23:28.521 --> 23:30.913
He first shows up
in Ankara, Turkey, last week.

23:30.956 --> 23:33.173
From there was to Athens,
then London to here.

23:33.217 --> 23:36.000
All tickets were purchased
at the airline counter, in cash.

23:36.043 --> 23:37.739
Think Nasry has
a similar weapon?

23:37.782 --> 23:39.782
Wouldn't surprise me.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.391
Let's keep a media lid on this
until we know more, all right?

23:44.434 --> 23:46.652
No names, no mention
of terrorists, no panic.

23:46.695 --> 23:48.043
TONY:
Hey, boss?

23:48.086 --> 23:49.521
What do you got?

23:49.565 --> 23:52.000
I showed the picture
of Kyle Nasry to the desk clerk

23:52.043 --> 23:53.521
at the Chesterfield Hotel.

23:53.565 --> 23:54.956
Nasry was there but left

23:55.000 --> 23:56.695
minutes before we arrived.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.608
Which is strange, because
he paid for a week in advance.

24:00.782 --> 24:02.608
[door hisses open,
elevator bell dings]

24:02.652 --> 24:06.565
NPRC forwarded Randall White's
medical records.

24:06.608 --> 24:08.826
It's him?It most assuredly is.

24:08.869 --> 24:11.782
Fingerprints and
blood type match.

24:11.826 --> 24:14.043
Abby is comparing DNA.

24:14.086 --> 24:17.826
All identifying scars,
marks and tattoos are present,

24:17.869 --> 24:22.391
but a cursory examination
turned up some curious facts.

24:22.434 --> 24:23.826
See these cuts and nicks

24:23.869 --> 24:25.434
on his face?

24:25.478 --> 24:27.173
Razor burn?

24:27.217 --> 24:29.608
Suggesting
a recently shaved beard.

24:31.739 --> 24:33.086
Then here.

24:33.130 --> 24:35.043
GIBBS:
That's a gang tattoo.

24:35.086 --> 24:36.608
From a miscreant youth,

24:36.652 --> 24:39.826
but I find this one
more informative.

24:39.869 --> 24:43.130
According to his records,

24:43.173 --> 24:45.043
this...

24:45.086 --> 24:47.434
was a U.S. Army Ranger

24:47.478 --> 24:50.652
"Death with Dishonor" tattoo,

24:50.695 --> 24:53.956
but it's been covered up
by this more intricate design.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.521
What's that tell you, Doc?

24:55.565 --> 24:57.956
That he was a
disgruntled soldier.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.478
That, combined with
his gang history and,

25:00.521 --> 25:04.652
well, a terrorist group
has a seductive appeal.

25:04.695 --> 25:07.086
They offered Mr. White
even more forms

25:07.130 --> 25:10.652
of spectacular violence.

25:13.478 --> 25:14.826
[elevator bell dings]

25:14.869 --> 25:16.739
[softly]:
Oh.

25:16.782 --> 25:18.739
[chuckles]

25:18.782 --> 25:20.739
[elevator bell dings]

25:20.782 --> 25:22.217
Hey, Spider.

25:23.478 --> 25:24.521
Hey, Zoe.

25:24.565 --> 25:26.260
So this is what you do
when you tell me

25:26.304 --> 25:27.608
you're working hard
at the office.

25:27.652 --> 25:29.217
[chuckles]

25:29.260 --> 25:30.434
Yeah.

25:30.478 --> 25:32.608
Well, you know...

25:32.652 --> 25:34.391
What are you doing here?

25:34.434 --> 25:36.043
I am on official business.

25:36.086 --> 25:37.652
Oh.

25:37.695 --> 25:39.478
What's that?

25:39.521 --> 25:40.478
Your forensic tech called me.

25:40.521 --> 25:41.869
Oh.

25:41.913 --> 25:43.434
Abby.
Yeah.

25:43.478 --> 25:45.478
She thought ATF
should take a look at a weapon

25:45.521 --> 25:46.782
that you guys took
into evidence.

25:46.826 --> 25:48.565
Oh.

25:48.608 --> 25:51.043
Well, as you know,
her lab is downstairs.

25:51.086 --> 25:53.130
How can we help you up here?

25:53.173 --> 25:56.608
I am up here to return something
that you left at my place

25:56.652 --> 25:58.565
when you rushed out
this morning.

25:58.608 --> 26:00.217
Mm.

26:00.260 --> 26:02.869
Yeah, well,
I was a little lightheaded.

26:02.913 --> 26:04.913
What did I leave?

26:06.130 --> 26:07.478
Uh... these.

26:07.521 --> 26:09.086
Oh, boy. Oh, yeah.

26:09.130 --> 26:11.043
You found the key.
Mm-hmm.

26:11.086 --> 26:12.304
I had you locked up
pretty good.

26:12.347 --> 26:14.086
Yeah, you did.

26:14.130 --> 26:16.130
Well...

26:17.434 --> 26:18.869
Um...

26:18.913 --> 26:21.434
are we keeping us a secret?

26:21.478 --> 26:23.043
[sighs]

26:23.086 --> 26:25.043
Yeah, uh, listen.

26:25.086 --> 26:26.521
This place is a henhouse.

26:26.565 --> 26:27.869
It practically runs on gossip,

26:27.913 --> 26:30.217
and I do not want to be
topic number one.

26:30.260 --> 26:33.173
And we're doing pretty good

26:33.217 --> 26:35.391
in this relationship, right?

26:35.434 --> 26:37.782
Right.

26:37.826 --> 26:39.434
[whispering]:
I don't want to spoil it.

26:41.434 --> 26:43.130
[whispering]:
Okay.

26:43.173 --> 26:45.478
Okay.
Eeh, you're very dangerous.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.347
[loudly]: Okay, no,
it looks good to me.

26:47.391 --> 26:48.869
I think your eyes are just fine.

26:48.913 --> 26:51.260
I'll take you down
to Abby's lab.

26:59.217 --> 27:01.304
That explains it.

27:01.347 --> 27:03.260
Tony's in love.

27:03.304 --> 27:05.043
Well, I don't know about love,

27:05.086 --> 27:06.739
but they're definitely in heat.

27:06.782 --> 27:09.521
Plus, a gun like this can
be downloaded and reproduced

27:09.565 --> 27:11.434
by anyone with a 3-D printer.

27:11.478 --> 27:13.608
This is the photo taken
by the Navy SEAL team

27:13.652 --> 27:15.043
when they rescued
Sarah Goode.

27:15.086 --> 27:16.695
Yep, this printer
could do the job,

27:16.739 --> 27:18.521
and it can be purchased for
just a couple thousand dollars.

27:18.565 --> 27:19.565
I disassembled the gun,

27:19.608 --> 27:21.913
and it's really quite simple.

27:21.956 --> 27:24.043
All the elements
are made of plastic,

27:24.086 --> 27:25.478
including the springs.I can't believe

27:25.521 --> 27:27.478
those parts came
out of a printer.

27:27.521 --> 27:29.304
The only metal component
is the firing pin,

27:29.347 --> 27:31.217
and it's a small,
common roofing nail.

27:31.260 --> 27:32.565
[elevator bell dings]It's completely unreadable
by a metal detector.

27:32.608 --> 27:35.217
Downside is
it only holds one bullet.

27:35.260 --> 27:37.260
There's no rifling,
so it's not very accurate.

27:37.304 --> 27:39.304
Only good at close range,
plus it's plastic,

27:39.347 --> 27:41.347
so it degrades after a few uses.

27:42.391 --> 27:44.695
Oh, hey, guys.

27:44.739 --> 27:48.086
Uh, you guys remember
Special Agent Zoe Keates.

27:48.130 --> 27:49.391
How have you been?Sure, yeah.

27:49.434 --> 27:50.478
Hi. Good.

27:50.521 --> 27:52.086
Hey.

27:52.130 --> 27:54.217
Did you guys
need something?

27:54.260 --> 27:56.173
Uh...

27:56.217 --> 27:57.434
Yes.

27:57.478 --> 27:59.043
You had mentioned
that you needed help

27:59.086 --> 28:01.304
with the encrypted files
on your laptop.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.869
I did?

28:03.913 --> 28:05.347
You did.

28:05.391 --> 28:07.478
I did.

28:07.521 --> 28:08.826
I...

28:08.869 --> 28:09.913
totally did.

28:09.956 --> 28:12.521
I forgot.
I'm sorry.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.478
Is everybody okay?

28:14.521 --> 28:15.695
KEATES:
I should get going.

28:15.739 --> 28:17.260
So, um, hey, Abby,

28:17.304 --> 28:19.086
if you need anything else,
just give me a buzz, okay?

28:19.130 --> 28:22.347
I will walk you
out, Agent Keates.Great.

28:22.391 --> 28:24.434
Good to see you guys.You, too.

28:24.478 --> 28:25.478
TONY:
Sorry, I don't know
what that was all about.

28:25.521 --> 28:27.043
[Tony continues indistinctly]

28:27.086 --> 28:29.347
[elevator bell dings]What is going on?

28:29.391 --> 28:31.130
Tony and Zoe are dating.

28:31.173 --> 28:33.130
Full-body-contact dating.

28:33.173 --> 28:33.826
What?

28:33.869 --> 28:34.826
Mm-hmm.

28:34.869 --> 28:36.086
And Tony didn't say anything?

28:36.130 --> 28:37.260
Usually he
gives those...

28:37.304 --> 28:40.304
graphic "we do not want
to hear" details

28:40.347 --> 28:42.086
about any conquests.Yeah, maybe

28:42.130 --> 28:44.608
it's 'cause this time
he's serious.

28:45.869 --> 28:47.391
Joint NCIS and FBI teams

28:47.434 --> 28:49.086
are staking out
Nasry's house in case

28:49.130 --> 28:50.913
he tries to contact his mother.We got a warrant

28:50.956 --> 28:52.260
to tap her phone, e-mail.

28:52.304 --> 28:54.086
Agents have
interviewed

28:54.130 --> 28:55.826
Nasry's friends, teachers,

28:55.869 --> 28:57.260
everyone he was close with.Yeah.

28:57.304 --> 28:59.434
If you believe them,
no one's heard from him.

28:59.478 --> 29:01.956
All right.
Aside from White's DNA

29:02.000 --> 29:04.347
and Nasry's fingerprints
at the terrorist apartment,

29:04.391 --> 29:06.739
do we have anything else
connecting the two?Yes.

29:06.782 --> 29:09.217
Chesterfield Hotel. White was
headed there from the airport.

29:09.260 --> 29:12.260
Nasry checked out
before we arrived.Why were they both in DC?

29:12.304 --> 29:13.565
[phone chimes]Sorry.

29:13.608 --> 29:15.260
[clears throat]

29:15.304 --> 29:17.043
It's a reminder to pick up Emily

29:17.086 --> 29:18.565
from her ballet class.

29:18.608 --> 29:19.608
Go.

29:21.391 --> 29:24.347
Tobias.

29:26.086 --> 29:28.913
If you need somebody
to talk to,

29:28.956 --> 29:30.565
we got a lot in common.

29:36.304 --> 29:38.173
[door opens]

29:40.956 --> 29:42.956
Is he all right?

29:44.000 --> 29:45.217
No.

29:45.260 --> 29:48.347
But he's putting up
a good front.

29:49.434 --> 29:51.956
Mm.

29:54.956 --> 29:56.913
[doorbell rings]SARAH:
Who is it?

29:56.956 --> 29:59.260
Special Agent Gibbs.

30:02.478 --> 30:04.217
Hi.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.217
Mr. Henderson

30:06.260 --> 30:08.434
at the State Department said
that they were finished

30:08.478 --> 30:12.217
with my debriefing, that I could
get on with my life.

30:12.260 --> 30:13.608
What's that gonna be?

30:13.652 --> 30:16.130
[chuckles]
Who knows?

30:16.173 --> 30:21.565
I have this feeling that you're
here for a reason, Agent Gibbs.

30:21.608 --> 30:24.173
Do you have more questions
for me?

30:24.217 --> 30:26.304
The man we spoke to you about,
Kyle Nasry,

30:26.347 --> 30:28.652
he's back in the United States.

30:28.695 --> 30:30.260
Do you think I'm in danger?

30:30.304 --> 30:33.043
No. You were kidnapped
and held for ransom

30:33.086 --> 30:36.260
halfway around the world.
That's all about money.

30:36.304 --> 30:38.782
There's no purpose in them
coming after you here.

30:38.826 --> 30:40.652
But I would like to ask you
about someone else.

30:40.695 --> 30:43.608
We believe that there was
another American terrorist

30:43.652 --> 30:46.173
in the apartment where you were
being held captive.

30:54.043 --> 30:56.347
Sorry.

30:56.391 --> 30:59.000
But did he come back
to the United States, too?

31:00.521 --> 31:03.695
Yeah, but he killed himself
before we could question him.

31:07.173 --> 31:10.130
I... wish I could be
of more help,

31:10.173 --> 31:13.695
but I never saw either of them.

31:22.260 --> 31:25.173
Okay. Thanks for your help.

31:30.956 --> 31:33.173
Are you okay?Yeah,

31:33.217 --> 31:36.304
Agent Gibbs. I'm fine.

31:40.391 --> 31:43.391
If you want to talk.

31:50.173 --> 31:52.521
Faheed.

31:55.217 --> 31:56.434
Randall's dead.

31:57.478 --> 32:00.347
It's all falling apart.

32:00.391 --> 32:02.913
Don't panic. We never thought
I'd be rescued

32:02.956 --> 32:04.739
or that I'd be back here.

32:06.086 --> 32:09.086
Let's use this to our advantage.

32:28.869 --> 32:31.260
DiNozzo say
why he was gonna be late?

32:31.304 --> 32:33.000
No.

32:34.739 --> 32:36.043
Do you know

32:36.086 --> 32:38.217
where he is?

32:38.260 --> 32:40.782
No.

32:43.130 --> 32:45.391
Probably that ATF gal.

32:45.434 --> 32:47.043
You know?

32:47.086 --> 32:49.000
Of course you know.What I
don't know

32:49.043 --> 32:51.391
is why he's trying
to keep it secret.

32:51.434 --> 32:52.782
Anything on Nasry?

32:52.826 --> 32:54.043
No.

32:54.086 --> 32:56.043
I'm in the office until 11:00

32:56.086 --> 32:59.086
and then I'm going to the
District Union Club luncheon.

32:59.130 --> 33:00.869
State Department
has requested that I attend.

33:00.913 --> 33:03.782
But I'll be reachable.

33:04.826 --> 33:06.043
FORNELL:
I grew up in a madhouse.

33:06.086 --> 33:07.347
Three brothers.

33:07.391 --> 33:10.043
The thought of raising
a teenage daughter

33:10.086 --> 33:12.565
by myself is...

33:12.608 --> 33:14.869
terrifying.

33:14.913 --> 33:17.086
Yeah, we can be difficult.

33:17.130 --> 33:18.130
I moved out

33:18.173 --> 33:20.521
of my one-bedroom, one-bath,

33:20.565 --> 33:22.521
typical divorced man's
apartment,

33:22.565 --> 33:24.521
moved into Diane's place.

33:24.565 --> 33:26.173
That makes sense.
The less you disrupt

33:26.217 --> 33:28.304
Emily's life, the better.

33:28.347 --> 33:30.695
No question.

33:30.739 --> 33:32.043
Probably would've
done that anyway.

33:32.086 --> 33:33.652
But, uh...

33:33.695 --> 33:36.173
now Diane's not there.

33:39.043 --> 33:41.130
I love Emily--

33:41.173 --> 33:43.086
she is the center
of my universe--

33:43.130 --> 33:44.739
but, uh...

33:44.782 --> 33:47.652
she's on the verge of womanhood

33:47.695 --> 33:49.826
if you catch my drift.

33:49.869 --> 33:51.086
Mm.

33:51.130 --> 33:54.086
I'm not comfortable
with all that stuff.

33:54.130 --> 33:56.695
[laughs]
Well, if you need some help,

33:56.739 --> 33:58.869
I'd be glad to talk to her.

33:58.913 --> 34:01.043
I think she'd listen to me.

34:01.086 --> 34:03.521
I'd really appreciate
that, Eleanor.

34:03.565 --> 34:04.826
Thank you.

34:09.043 --> 34:12.347
You know,
you talk about Emily,

34:12.391 --> 34:15.304
and how she's dealing
with Diane's death.

34:15.347 --> 34:17.956
Mm.But, uh...

34:18.000 --> 34:20.565
how are you doing?

34:25.086 --> 34:26.695
Well, it's not really about me.

34:26.739 --> 34:29.217
Right now, it's about Emily.

34:29.260 --> 34:30.782
I can be a dad to her,

34:30.826 --> 34:33.478
but she lost her mom.

34:35.391 --> 34:38.086
[cell phone rings]

34:38.130 --> 34:40.217
Fornell.

34:40.260 --> 34:41.869
[man speaks indistinctly]

34:41.913 --> 34:44.565
Yeah, I'll hold.

34:44.608 --> 34:46.043
Wiretap paid off.
Nasry called his mom.

34:46.086 --> 34:47.782
Just hung up.

34:47.826 --> 34:49.347
They're trying to
triangulate his location.

34:49.391 --> 34:51.391
Finally a break.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.869
Looks like she's
going somewhere.

34:57.086 --> 34:59.826
Or not.

34:59.869 --> 35:01.260
She's made us.

35:01.304 --> 35:03.913
I'll get back to you.

35:07.043 --> 35:08.478
Guess we didn't blend in
too well.

35:08.521 --> 35:09.565
Agent Fornell,

35:09.608 --> 35:11.347
Kyle just called me.

35:11.391 --> 35:13.130
He asked me to
meet with him.

35:13.173 --> 35:15.000
He needs money.

35:15.043 --> 35:16.695
I'm glad you're telling us.

35:16.739 --> 35:17.826
Mm-hmm.

35:17.869 --> 35:19.260
Why are you?

35:19.304 --> 35:22.826
He-he sounded frightened
and-and strange.

35:22.869 --> 35:25.260
This needs to end
before he hurts himself

35:25.304 --> 35:27.304
or anyone else.

35:29.521 --> 35:31.304
Finally got into
the external hard drives.

35:31.347 --> 35:33.260
I'm downloading
the files to my computer.

35:33.304 --> 35:35.652
Once I clean them up,
we should be able to view them.

35:35.695 --> 35:37.000
What are they?

35:37.043 --> 35:38.000
[elevator bell dings]Definitely video files.

35:38.043 --> 35:39.565
Um, a lot of Arabic.

35:39.608 --> 35:41.565
So I'm gonna have to run
them through a translator.

35:41.608 --> 35:44.478
[elevator bell dings]Boss! Just heard from Bishop.

35:44.521 --> 35:46.869
Rachel Nasry just got a call
from her son to meet.

35:46.913 --> 35:48.695
Tony's pulling the car around.

35:48.739 --> 35:49.956
Go! Go! Go!

36:07.478 --> 36:09.217
Thanks, Mom.

36:12.782 --> 36:14.869
[tires squealing]

36:18.130 --> 36:20.000
NCIS! Hands in the air!On the ground!
Get down!

36:20.043 --> 36:23.043
Get down now!Get down!
On your knees now!

36:23.086 --> 36:24.826
Put your hands
behind your back.

36:24.869 --> 36:26.826
Behind your back.

36:26.869 --> 36:29.391
[handcuffs clicking]

36:29.434 --> 36:32.347
[low chatter]

36:32.391 --> 36:34.304
Thank you.

36:34.347 --> 36:36.304
VANCE:
Be starting pretty soon,

36:36.347 --> 36:38.565
I imagine.

36:38.608 --> 36:40.565
Sarah Goode?

36:40.608 --> 36:42.782
I'm NCIS Director Leon Vance.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.782
Nice to meet you,
Director.

36:44.826 --> 36:46.782
I've been talking
to Special Agent Gibbs.

36:46.826 --> 36:48.782
Sorry I wasn't of any help.

36:48.826 --> 36:50.000
I just wanted to let
you know how much

36:50.043 --> 36:51.826
we appreciate your cooperation.

36:53.565 --> 36:56.913
So, you're a fan of the Imam?

36:56.956 --> 36:58.869
Big one.Hmm.

36:58.913 --> 36:59.913
So am I.I've been invited

36:59.956 --> 37:01.000
to meet with him privately

37:01.043 --> 37:02.217
after the speech.

37:02.260 --> 37:03.782
Well, I envy you.
I have to settle

37:03.826 --> 37:05.130
for a much larger audience.

37:05.173 --> 37:06.956
[both laugh]Enjoy the luncheon.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.956
Thank you.

37:15.130 --> 37:17.608
GIBBS:
Are you still
enjoying this, Kyle?

37:17.652 --> 37:19.826
I've told you my name is Faheed.

37:19.869 --> 37:21.652
Right, right. Okay.

37:21.695 --> 37:23.173
You're Muslim, yeah.
Got it.

37:23.217 --> 37:24.956
Whatever.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.521
You were planning
to meet Randall White

37:26.565 --> 37:28.347
at the Chesterfield Hotel.

37:28.391 --> 37:29.956
He had a plastic gun.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.130
What was the plan?

37:38.652 --> 37:40.565
White's dead.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.652
Look at him!

37:45.956 --> 37:48.347
We've been here for two hours.

37:48.391 --> 37:49.956
I'm getting hungry.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
You do know
my dietary restrictions?

37:55.913 --> 37:57.000
Suit yourself, Fahad.

37:57.043 --> 37:58.173
Faheed!

37:58.217 --> 37:59.782
FORNELL:
Nasry.

37:59.826 --> 38:02.347
Same narcissistic punk I
interviewed five years ago.

38:02.391 --> 38:04.521
How'd I miss the signs?

38:09.391 --> 38:12.043
While you were being
blown off by Faheed,

38:12.086 --> 38:13.565
I got a call from Homeland.

38:13.608 --> 38:15.391
With Nasry in custody,

38:15.434 --> 38:17.652
they've lowered the threat level
in the DC area.

38:17.695 --> 38:19.782
Something's not right.

38:19.826 --> 38:21.434
Ah.I concur.

38:21.478 --> 38:24.782
He doesn't fit the profile
of a jihadi terrorist.

38:24.826 --> 38:27.130
He allowed himself
to be taken captive

38:27.173 --> 38:31.043
rather than seek martyrdom
like his fanatical friend.

38:32.782 --> 38:35.739
Uh, Abby needs
to see you, Gibbs.What's she got?

38:35.782 --> 38:38.173
Oh, no. Do I look stupid?
I'm not gonna steal her thunder.

38:38.217 --> 38:40.173
I was finally able
to view the data

38:40.217 --> 38:41.565
from the terrorists' files.

38:41.608 --> 38:42.782
Along with training

38:42.826 --> 38:44.608
and recruiting videos, I found

38:44.652 --> 38:46.043
the unedited recording

38:46.086 --> 38:49.130
of Sarah Goode's ransom plea.

38:49.173 --> 38:51.130
[keyboard keys clacking]

38:51.173 --> 38:53.956
I'm begging the U.S. government.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.739
Abbs, I've seen this already.Oh, just wait.

38:55.782 --> 38:56.826
Please give them the money
that they're asking for

38:56.869 --> 38:58.521
so I can get home.There's more.

38:58.565 --> 39:01.739
If you don't,
they're gonna kill me.

39:01.782 --> 39:03.217
Please.

39:04.782 --> 39:06.869
Please.

39:11.086 --> 39:12.826
That was great.No, I can do better.

39:12.869 --> 39:14.304
I think I can do better.

39:17.608 --> 39:19.869
For $100 million,
I need to be more convincing.

39:19.913 --> 39:22.826
No. That was just right.

39:22.869 --> 39:25.869
Nasry gave up too easily.

39:27.434 --> 39:28.956
He used his mother
to draw us away from Sarah.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.391
He wanted to be captured.

39:34.434 --> 39:36.956
Sarah Goode left the
hotel over an hour ago.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.043
Spoke to the doorman,
said she left on foot.

39:39.086 --> 39:40.956
Think she was radicalized
in Syria?

39:41.000 --> 39:42.608
Yeah, looks that way.
Kidnapping was a fake.

39:42.652 --> 39:44.347
Ransom demand was
to raise money.

39:44.391 --> 39:46.347
Hundreds of millions of dollars
buys a lot of weapons.

39:46.391 --> 39:48.652
No, some-something
doesn't track.

39:48.695 --> 39:50.782
I mean, Nasry and White left
the apartment in Syria before

39:50.826 --> 39:53.130
the raid. They were already
working their way back here

39:53.173 --> 39:55.130
through Turkey and Europe.What's your point?

39:55.173 --> 39:57.217
They didn't know Sarah'd be
rescued and brought back.

39:57.260 --> 39:58.521
Whatever they were
planning has nothing

39:58.565 --> 39:59.608
to do with her kidnapping.

39:59.652 --> 40:01.043
BOLO's out.

40:01.086 --> 40:03.000
Airports, train
and bus stations are on alert.

40:03.043 --> 40:05.217
We should tell Vance.He's not here.

40:05.260 --> 40:06.652
He's at the District Union Club.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.130
And that's where
the Imam is speaking.

40:09.217 --> 40:11.217
[phone ringing]

40:12.739 --> 40:14.652
Vance.

40:14.695 --> 40:16.043
[speaking Arabic]

40:16.086 --> 40:19.043
Pleasure seeing you.

40:19.086 --> 40:20.826
Salaam alaikum.
Very nice to see you.

40:20.869 --> 40:22.130
Thank you for coming.

40:24.434 --> 40:26.043
Excuse me, sir.

40:26.086 --> 40:27.869
NCIS. Okay, we're clear.

40:27.913 --> 40:29.956
Come on.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.086
[speaking native language]

40:33.130 --> 40:34.956
Pardon me, excuse me.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.173
Salaam alaikum, Imam Hasan.

40:37.217 --> 40:39.217
Wa alaikum as-salaam,
Sarah Goode.

40:39.260 --> 40:40.782
Coming through.
Sorry.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.000
I've been waiting to meet you.
I'm so happy you made it

40:44.043 --> 40:46.260
here safely,
and we are so grateful

40:46.304 --> 40:48.173
for all of
the wonderful work...

40:48.217 --> 40:50.565
[panicked shouting]Drop it, Sarah!

40:50.608 --> 40:52.652
Drop it![grunting]

40:52.695 --> 40:54.565
Let it go! Let it go, Sarah!

40:54.608 --> 40:55.869
Let it go!

40:55.913 --> 40:57.478
[grunting]

40:57.521 --> 41:00.608
[Sarah yelling in Arabic]

41:00.652 --> 41:02.913
Get her out of here!
Get her out of here now!

41:02.956 --> 41:04.782
[continues yelling in Arabic]

41:07.217 --> 41:09.695
You all right?I'm okay. Thank you.

41:09.739 --> 41:11.478
[Sarah continues yelling
in Arabic]

41:11.521 --> 41:13.217
FORNELL:
I'm at NCIS, honey.

41:13.260 --> 41:14.608
I'm leaving right now.

41:14.652 --> 41:16.086
I'll be home in 20 minutes.

41:16.130 --> 41:18.565
I love you.

41:19.608 --> 41:21.173
Bishop?

41:21.217 --> 41:22.347
Hmm?Do you think
you could do me

41:22.391 --> 41:23.913
a big favor and, um,

41:23.956 --> 41:26.782
help me finish
these ECD documents.

41:26.826 --> 41:29.043
You got somewhere to be,
DiNozzo?

41:29.086 --> 41:31.173
Uh, yeah, sort of.

41:31.217 --> 41:32.695
Hey, Tony. Look who I found

41:32.739 --> 41:34.043
waiting for you
in the parking lot.

41:35.565 --> 41:38.478
Whoa, hey.

41:38.521 --> 41:39.826
What are you doing here?

41:39.869 --> 41:41.652
Relax, Spider.
They know about us.

41:41.695 --> 41:42.826
Who knows?

41:42.869 --> 41:44.478
ALL:
We all know.

41:46.826 --> 41:48.956
It's about time. Geez.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.043
[laughs]
How did you find out?

41:51.086 --> 41:53.521
We're trained investigators,
my friend.

41:53.565 --> 41:56.478
And in honor
of us coming out,

41:56.521 --> 41:58.521
Tony is gonna buy
everyone drinks.

41:58.565 --> 42:00.043
I am?

42:00.086 --> 42:02.521
Yeah, you are.

42:02.565 --> 42:03.565
Come on.

42:03.608 --> 42:05.434
Get your coat.

42:05.478 --> 42:07.608
Yeah, boss.I'll take a rain check.

42:07.652 --> 42:09.956
And I will as well.TONY:
All right.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.478
McGEE:
You heard-- Tony's buying.

42:11.521 --> 42:12.478
BISHOP:
Sweet.

42:12.521 --> 42:13.826
Want to join us
for dinner?

42:13.869 --> 42:15.130
Our ex-mother-in-law is making

42:15.173 --> 42:17.956
her famous lamb goulash.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.565
Another rain check.

42:20.608 --> 42:22.478
You're on your own, Tobias.

42:25.608 --> 42:27.347
I miss her.

42:27.391 --> 42:29.043
Diane.

42:29.086 --> 42:32.043
More than I could
have imagined.

42:32.086 --> 42:34.391
Yeah, I know.

42:34.434 --> 42:36.521
The first time around,

42:36.565 --> 42:39.000
well, you know,

42:39.043 --> 42:41.521
she's difficult, tough, but

42:41.565 --> 42:44.826
the second time,
we were older, smarter.

42:47.086 --> 42:48.434
It was different.

42:52.521 --> 42:54.434
God, I loved her.

42:56.608 --> 42:59.043
Should've been me.

43:06.043 --> 43:08.173
You make me a promise.

43:08.217 --> 43:10.739
When you find this monster...

43:13.478 --> 43:16.260
...I get a piece of him.

43:32.869 --> 43:35.869
