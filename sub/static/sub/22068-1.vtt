00:35.161 --> 00:39.529
We got a serious matter on our hands here,
three murders and a missing girl.

00:40.293 --> 00:45.084
Right, yeah, so I hear. Terrible thing,
that, just, uh, just terrible.

00:45.164 --> 00:47.424
I'm interested in your
whereabouts that evening...

00:47.504 --> 00:50.332
...anything you might've seen
or heard, that type of thing.

00:50.412 --> 00:54.364
So I know you mentioned to the officers
that you were at the bar with your wife.

00:54.444 --> 00:57.982
- Was anyone else there?
- My buddy, Bo.

00:58.062 --> 01:01.059
From what I understand, he used
to run with the Candy Bandits Gang.

01:01.139 --> 01:03.683
I mean, are you comfortable with
bringin' a guy like that into this town?

01:03.763 --> 01:08.006
We've all made mistakes, Deputy.
As far as I can tell, he regrets his past.

01:08.086 --> 01:09.937
A lot of us do.

01:50.346 --> 01:51.901
Okay.

01:54.008 --> 01:55.894
Here we go!

02:18.067 --> 02:20.274
- Mom?
- Hmm.

02:22.498 --> 02:24.577
Why did we move here?

02:25.607 --> 02:27.887
You haven't figured that out yet.

02:29.362 --> 02:31.044
Do you want to go back to the trailer?

02:31.124 --> 02:32.828
No.

02:34.161 --> 02:36.165
It's just this town.

02:36.245 --> 02:38.501
Well, you're almost 18.

02:38.581 --> 02:40.929
You'll be old enough to leave then.

02:41.009 --> 02:43.012
You're gonna kick me out?

02:45.202 --> 02:49.460
- You know what I've been through.
- I'm the only one that does know!

02:50.225 --> 02:52.945
You should trust me to do the right thing.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.929
For all of us!

03:06.838 --> 03:08.845
Boys, stop it!

03:11.345 --> 03:12.786
Get inside.

03:31.804 --> 03:34.728
- Marilyn!
- Got room for one more, neighbor?

03:35.328 --> 03:38.472
Justin, did you bring your magic kit today?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.383
Ah, well, Ricky and Greg are here.

03:40.663 --> 03:43.588
I bet they'd love to see your latest tricks.

03:43.668 --> 03:45.226
Come on in!

03:51.380 --> 03:54.464
How, uh, how do you manage all those kids?

03:54.544 --> 03:57.093
Years of practice, huh.

03:57.173 --> 04:01.448
Johnny and the girls,
they usually fend for themselves.

04:01.528 --> 04:03.813
It's those two I have to keep an eye on.

04:05.810 --> 04:09.469
Hey, um, and I don't mean to, uh, but...

04:09.549 --> 04:12.654
...overstep boundaries here,
but all the time you've been here...

04:12.734 --> 04:15.207
...you've never mentioned their dad.

04:18.873 --> 04:21.921
We separated a while ago.

04:22.101 --> 04:24.790
Oh, sorry to hear that.

04:25.270 --> 04:27.650
Things just weren't working out.

04:27.830 --> 04:29.367
Hmm.

04:29.647 --> 04:33.649
You can't help someone that's drowning.

04:34.329 --> 04:36.431
They're just gonna pull you down with them.

04:38.038 --> 04:41.802
Eventually I asked myself, do I sink or swim?

05:04.123 --> 05:05.960
You all right?

05:06.451 --> 05:08.301
I'm fine.

05:10.759 --> 05:12.481
Is my wife here?

05:14.647 --> 05:16.519
She's inside.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.987
Good.

05:19.567 --> 05:21.422
You come here now.

05:26.972 --> 05:29.662
I feel kinda bad about what happened.

05:30.552 --> 05:32.363
You feel bad about it?

05:32.443 --> 05:35.757
Well, yeah, that's my wife.

05:35.837 --> 05:38.793
Now, that might not be
the perfect marriage...

05:38.873 --> 05:41.659
...but I'm tryin' to make that work.

05:43.416 --> 05:46.664
- You got that?
- Okay.

05:47.446 --> 05:50.792
Oh, I wish my baggage gave me so much...

05:50.872 --> 05:53.804
...uh, I don't know, clarity.

05:53.884 --> 05:56.966
Well, maybe don't think of it as baggage.

05:57.046 --> 06:00.651
Call it "life experiences."

06:01.531 --> 06:04.945
Yeah, well, if life keeps going
the way it's going...

06:05.784 --> 06:08.401
...I'm gonna have to swim away myself.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.718
You tell your mom?

06:11.198 --> 06:12.457
No.

06:12.857 --> 06:14.380
Good.

06:16.031 --> 06:17.618
Don't.

06:18.098 --> 06:20.501
I just wanna make sure you're all right.

06:22.544 --> 06:24.372
I am.

06:29.401 --> 06:34.318
I guess when we say yes to someone,
we say yes to all their problems.

06:34.398 --> 06:36.238
Don't I know it.

06:37.118 --> 06:39.979
He's always had a bit
of devil in him, you know?

06:40.059 --> 06:43.514
Mmm, I'm sure that's what
attracted me to begin with, but...

06:43.594 --> 06:46.817
...now since Bo's been
staying with us, hmm-mm.

06:47.519 --> 06:49.527
Now, I'll go see my wife.

06:50.107 --> 06:53.729
You just, uh, you carry on
with the porch now.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.789
Good girl.

07:12.025 --> 07:15.506
- Well, speak of the devil.
- Good afternoon, ladies.

07:15.586 --> 07:19.441
Sorry, I... I didn't to mean to
interrupt your little chat, now.

07:19.521 --> 07:21.968
Got my buddy Bo here, Sue.

07:22.048 --> 07:24.692
He's got a real nice surprise for you.

07:24.772 --> 07:27.024
- Sue.
- What are you doing here?

07:27.104 --> 07:29.995
- I told you I'd be home later.
- Oh, come on...

07:30.075 --> 07:34.386
...I just wanna spend all the time
I can with my beautiful wife, now.

07:34.466 --> 07:35.847
Yeah, of course.

07:35.927 --> 07:39.163
We're all gonna go to the bar
for a drink. Sue, uh...

07:39.861 --> 07:41.457
...would you like to join us?

07:41.537 --> 07:44.926
Oh, I'm sorry, Bo,
I gotta look after the kids.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.437
- Let's go.
- Oh, come on now!

07:46.517 --> 07:48.938
Come on, let's go! You, go!

07:49.018 --> 07:52.076
- Uh, I'll just leave these here.
- Thanks, Bo.

07:53.471 --> 07:54.997
Move.

07:56.134 --> 07:58.162
Sue, um, thank you.

07:58.242 --> 08:00.412
I'll see you in the morning, yeah?

08:08.728 --> 08:11.370
Hey, what were you two
talking about back there?

08:11.450 --> 08:13.075
Chit-chat, nothing major.

08:13.155 --> 08:16.083
Bullshit. I heard my name being mentioned.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.706
Yeah, you're my husband.
I can't talk about you?

08:18.786 --> 08:23.218
No, you cannot. You don't mention my
name to that woman, you understand?

08:23.298 --> 08:26.185
You've got no right to tell me what to do.

08:31.543 --> 08:33.102
Yeah.

08:34.303 --> 08:35.424
Yeah.

08:38.821 --> 08:40.645
You all right?

08:40.865 --> 08:42.191
Uh-huh.

08:45.572 --> 08:47.430
Come on.

09:04.930 --> 09:09.207
I thought we'd have a full house
tonight. Apparently not.

09:09.510 --> 09:11.365
Looks pretty full to me.

09:11.845 --> 09:15.981
Where's Johnny?
I told him not to go out tonight.

09:16.161 --> 09:17.593
Um...

09:18.433 --> 09:20.783
He's staying at his buddy's place tonight.

09:21.444 --> 09:23.711
- Dana?
- Yeah.

09:24.835 --> 09:28.750
He has some stuff going on
and Johnny said he was gonna help out.

09:29.030 --> 09:30.852
What stuff?

09:32.643 --> 09:34.216
Um...

09:35.043 --> 09:36.551
...I don't know.

09:37.985 --> 09:39.575
Hmm.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.138
Mom?

10:34.757 --> 10:36.647
Whose is that?

10:37.221 --> 10:39.098
It's mine.

10:39.974 --> 10:41.783
What's the problem?

10:42.628 --> 10:44.710
Are you going away again?

10:46.757 --> 10:48.603
Just for tonight.

10:51.972 --> 10:54.041
I'm gonna stay with the Coopers.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.152
They're good people, churchgoers.

10:58.104 --> 11:00.739
All right, that's fine.

11:01.459 --> 11:05.071
Well, it's dark, at least take the car.

11:07.207 --> 11:08.500
Thanks, Mom.

11:21.351 --> 11:23.754
Looks like it's just you and me, kiddo.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.896
Can we make some popcorn?

11:27.914 --> 11:29.655
Sure.

11:35.270 --> 11:40.745
You know, I get so caught up with
everyone else, we don't always talk...

11:41.355 --> 11:43.210
...just us.

11:43.782 --> 11:45.460
How are you?

11:45.540 --> 11:47.508
I'm fine, Mom.

11:47.588 --> 11:50.422
You know, when I was younger...

11:50.502 --> 11:53.965
...I had dreams. Oh, lots of them.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.743
I dreamt...

11:59.123 --> 12:01.754
...that you'd have a better life than I had.

12:02.284 --> 12:04.093
All of you, that...

12:04.923 --> 12:07.177
...that I'd be a better mom.

12:09.096 --> 12:12.322
That I wouldn't make the same
mistakes my mother made.

12:14.125 --> 12:16.147
Two out of three ain't bad.

12:18.124 --> 12:19.736
I guess...

12:19.816 --> 12:22.834
...some dreams don't always come true.

12:29.258 --> 12:32.190
Sheila doesn't understand why we moved here.

12:32.270 --> 12:36.062
- Why did we?
- Oh, because sometimes...

12:36.142 --> 12:38.847
...other people back you into a corner.

12:38.927 --> 12:43.325
Oh, you put up with it for a while,
but eventually I said...

12:43.405 --> 12:45.269
"...You know what?

12:45.349 --> 12:48.278
"It's time to do things on my own terms."

12:51.169 --> 12:54.201
Oh, I wonder who that is.

12:56.302 --> 12:57.842
Hello?

12:58.790 --> 13:01.881
Johnny, we're gonna have
words tomorrow, mister.

13:01.961 --> 13:05.192
<i>Why don't you check the children?</i>

13:09.450 --> 13:11.297
Who is this?

13:18.126 --> 13:21.576
- Are you okay, Mom?
- Just a wrong number.

13:22.256 --> 13:25.916
I, um, I'm gonna head to bed.

13:25.996 --> 13:28.026
Stay up if you like.

13:29.168 --> 13:32.225
- Would you put the trash out?
- Sure.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.274
<i>You used to really be scared here.</i>

15:00.808 --> 15:04.028
- <i>Johnny!</i>
- <i>You're still afraid!</i>

15:04.108 --> 15:06.136
<i>Stop it now, I mean it!</i>

15:09.916 --> 15:12.953
<i>They're coming to get you, Barbara!</i>

15:13.433 --> 15:15.829
<i>Stop it. You're ignorant.</i>

15:15.909 --> 15:18.512
<i>They're coming for you, Barbara!</i>

15:18.592 --> 15:21.368
<i>Stop it! You're acting like a child!</i>

15:21.448 --> 15:23.629
<i>They're coming for you!</i>

15:23.709 --> 15:26.248
<i>Look, there comes one of them now!</i>

15:27.076 --> 15:29.305
<i>He'll hear you!</i>

15:29.385 --> 15:32.021
- <i>I'm getting out of here!</i>
- <i>Johnny!</i>

15:42.549 --> 15:44.374
Who is it?

15:44.454 --> 15:47.741
Look, I'm... I'm sorry to bother you, I...

15:48.821 --> 15:51.503
...I lost my wheels just down the road.

15:54.116 --> 15:56.582
Okay, so what do you want?

15:56.662 --> 15:59.750
Well... well, I need some help.

15:59.830 --> 16:01.326
There's a mechanic in town.

16:01.406 --> 16:03.975
They probably have some
kind of all-night service.

16:05.155 --> 16:08.608
Well, sorry to say, I can't afford that...

16:08.688 --> 16:13.094
...besides, now... now that
wouldn't make a difference.

16:13.174 --> 16:15.131
How come?

16:15.211 --> 16:18.694
- Because I don't have a car.
- You said you lost your wheels.

16:18.774 --> 16:22.017
Well, that was as far
as my last ride took me.

16:23.155 --> 16:24.983
You're a hitchhiker?

16:25.363 --> 16:27.237
Guilty as charged.

16:27.539 --> 16:29.363
Have you ever hitched?

16:30.067 --> 16:31.581
No.

16:32.183 --> 16:34.331
My dad always told me it was dangerous.

16:34.763 --> 16:38.797
Now, your daddy sounds like a smart man.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.970
Is your daddy home right now?

16:42.272 --> 16:43.841
Why?

16:49.916 --> 16:52.150
I was looking for a ride into town...

16:52.752 --> 16:56.223
...but I can see there's no car out here.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.695
That doesn't mean we don't have one.

16:59.697 --> 17:03.264
But... but you don't have a garage...

17:03.344 --> 17:05.906
...and there's no vehicle around back either.

17:06.997 --> 17:09.871
How long have you been outside the house?

17:12.340 --> 17:14.163
What do you want?

17:15.125 --> 17:17.017
I was thinking...

17:17.396 --> 17:20.901
...perhaps your kind daddy could, well...

17:20.981 --> 17:22.813
...put me up for the night.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.098
I don't...

17:25.554 --> 17:27.362
...I don't think we can do that.

17:27.442 --> 17:29.907
Okay, fair enough.

17:30.710 --> 17:35.428
Uh, can you just let me in
for a minute to make one phone call?

17:35.508 --> 17:37.126
Who do you wanna call?

17:37.206 --> 17:39.973
A friend of mine, he's in the next town.

17:40.053 --> 17:42.456
Perhaps he can pick me up now.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.689
I can't let you in.

17:48.630 --> 17:50.762
Okay, okay, listen now.

17:50.842 --> 17:55.656
How about I give you his number
and you can call him for me?

17:57.266 --> 17:59.740
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

18:01.760 --> 18:05.420
Come on, now, it'll only take a minute.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.710
Now, now listen, his name's Dee.

18:08.790 --> 18:12.380
Just tell him where we are
and that... that I need a lift.

18:13.529 --> 18:15.034
Fine.

18:15.768 --> 18:18.765
- What's the number?
- You got a pen?

18:18.845 --> 18:20.366
Uh...

18:21.465 --> 18:23.317
...hang on a sec.

18:28.848 --> 18:30.416
Hello?

18:31.136 --> 18:33.186
- Yeah?
- Got it.

18:33.266 --> 18:34.867
Good.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.343
The number's 555...

18:38.389 --> 18:40.262
...02...

18:40.665 --> 18:42.728
...65...

18:42.808 --> 18:44.651
...01...

18:45.592 --> 18:47.566
- You got that?
- Yeah.

18:47.646 --> 18:49.808
Now, now you just call Dee...

18:49.888 --> 18:53.348
...and tell him I'll meet him
at the Backdoor Bar in town.

18:53.984 --> 18:55.826
All right.

18:56.952 --> 18:58.753
What's your name?

19:01.986 --> 19:03.884
Did you hear me?

19:04.727 --> 19:07.332
Yeah, I hear you real good.

19:07.773 --> 19:09.539
So what's your name?

19:10.517 --> 19:12.528
Well, my name's Marco.

19:14.398 --> 19:16.181
All right.

20:47.403 --> 20:49.279
I called your friend.

20:49.359 --> 20:51.494
He says he'll meet you at the bar in town.

20:51.584 --> 20:55.860
Okay, good, thank you.

20:57.531 --> 21:01.211
Listen, it's quite a walk to town from here.

21:01.891 --> 21:04.711
The landlord's place is about
a ten minute walk away.

21:05.191 --> 21:07.429
Maybe he'll give you a ride to the bar.

21:09.699 --> 21:12.504
Okay, well, we'll try that.

21:13.507 --> 21:15.313
Wait a second.

21:16.305 --> 21:17.757
We?

21:21.750 --> 21:23.821
I... I meant me.

21:25.764 --> 21:28.221
Uh, okay.

21:29.274 --> 21:30.975
Good night.

21:31.615 --> 21:33.165
Yeah.

21:34.006 --> 21:35.857
Good night.

22:09.986 --> 22:11.847
What's all that racket about?

22:13.533 --> 22:16.630
There was some really creepy guy at the door.

22:17.060 --> 22:19.728
- Well, what guy?
- Some hitchhiker.

22:19.808 --> 22:23.213
I didn't let him in,
I just talked to him through the door.

22:23.293 --> 22:25.838
He kept asking if he could use the phone.

22:25.918 --> 22:30.444
I know it doesn't sound that bad,
but it was really, really creepy, I swear.

22:30.524 --> 22:33.630
I think he'd been hanging
around outside the house.

22:33.710 --> 22:36.489
- Wait here.
- Where are you going?

22:40.674 --> 22:44.524
Whoever's out there, you better
get the hell off my property!

22:47.005 --> 22:50.010
Mmm, just as I thought!

22:52.270 --> 22:54.213
There's no one there now.

22:54.293 --> 22:57.417
There was someone here, I swear.

22:57.497 --> 23:00.961
- You believe me, don't you?
- Oh, sure I do.

23:01.041 --> 23:02.929
It was really creepy.

23:03.309 --> 23:05.381
I don't think I can go to bed yet.

23:05.461 --> 23:08.727
Well, how about I make us some hot chocolate?

23:09.233 --> 23:11.041
That would be nice.

23:18.770 --> 23:21.925
That guy could've gone
to one of the other cabins.

23:22.005 --> 23:23.909
I wonder why he came here.

23:23.989 --> 23:25.523
Who knows?

23:25.603 --> 23:29.282
People are strange around this town.

23:29.362 --> 23:31.400
They all have agendas.

23:31.733 --> 23:33.778
Lots of secrets in Keddie!

23:34.676 --> 23:36.709
Kind of like this family.

23:39.287 --> 23:40.898
What do you mean?

23:40.978 --> 23:44.269
When were you gonna tell me
about Sheila and the baby?

23:46.508 --> 23:49.170
Is this the right time
for this kind of conversation?

23:49.250 --> 23:51.094
I deserve to know.

23:51.474 --> 23:53.500
I'm not a little kid anymore.

23:58.312 --> 24:01.330
You're right, okay, um...

24:02.329 --> 24:04.359
...Sheila did fall pregnant...

24:04.439 --> 24:06.951
...and that's why she moved away for a while.

24:07.831 --> 24:10.328
- I asked her not to tell you about it.
- Why?

24:10.408 --> 24:13.327
Well, I didn't wanna encourage you
down the same path, down my path!

24:13.407 --> 24:18.289
- Gee, thanks!
- No, that's not what I meant.

24:19.089 --> 24:21.947
I don't regret having you kids.

24:23.477 --> 24:24.965
But...

24:25.045 --> 24:28.180
...I just... I don't want you
to grow up too fast.

24:29.240 --> 24:33.325
Look, we'll talk more about this tomorrow.

24:33.405 --> 24:35.017
I'm going to bed.

24:35.097 --> 24:36.570
You coming up?

24:37.756 --> 24:41.031
Yeah, after I finish this.

24:43.166 --> 24:45.770
You feeling better now, honey?

24:45.850 --> 24:49.083
Still a bit creeped out, but I'll be fine.

25:40.703 --> 25:42.586
Who is it?

25:44.119 --> 25:46.604
You never called him, did you?

25:46.684 --> 25:48.266
What?

25:49.212 --> 25:51.622
You never called my friend.

25:53.116 --> 25:55.205
What are you doing back here?

25:55.285 --> 25:57.319
Shouldn't you be waiting at the bar?

25:58.428 --> 26:00.245
Answer the question!

26:04.809 --> 26:07.879
- You didn't call him, did you?
- I did!

26:08.543 --> 26:10.797
- You're lying!
- I'm not!

26:10.877 --> 26:12.916
Do you know how I know you're lying?

26:12.996 --> 26:14.579
How?

26:16.466 --> 26:20.023
Because I cut your phone line an hour ago.

26:32.066 --> 26:33.639
Mom!

26:36.262 --> 26:37.802
Mom!

26:37.882 --> 26:40.527
- What is it, what's wrong?
- Mom, that guy came back!

26:40.607 --> 26:44.590
- Oh, right, I...
- No, Mom, don't, he said he cut the phone!

26:44.670 --> 26:46.205
- What?
- He was telling the truth!

26:47.426 --> 26:48.570
What the hell is that?

26:48.650 --> 26:50.542
It came from the window, someone's out there!

26:50.622 --> 26:54.834
Look, it's probably just some
drunken hobo playing a sick joke!

26:54.914 --> 26:56.430
Oh, my God!

26:56.510 --> 26:59.111
Don't worry, stay calm!

26:59.191 --> 27:02.406
Mom, Mom, we're not alone.

27:10.751 --> 27:12.764
Mom, Mom!

27:13.544 --> 27:16.603
Mom! Mom!

27:26.906 --> 27:28.799
Come on!

28:39.094 --> 28:40.905
Who's there?

29:09.944 --> 29:12.944
It's okay, boys, Mommy's here.

29:13.024 --> 29:16.585
I'm gonna get help. Stay beneath that bed!

29:16.865 --> 29:21.484
Do not come out
under any circumstances, okay?

29:22.922 --> 29:24.325
- Take this.
- What for?

29:24.405 --> 29:26.519
I'm going to the landlord's cottage
to call the police...

29:26.599 --> 29:28.967
- Mom, don't leave us!
- I'll be back straightaway.

29:29.047 --> 29:33.015
- Mom, I don't think I can...
- Tina, you are strong!

29:33.545 --> 29:36.081
All right. Just keep the boys calm.

29:36.161 --> 29:39.183
- I'll be back before you know it.
- All right.

29:53.233 --> 29:56.442
Mom! Mom! Mom!

29:56.522 --> 29:59.330
Mom! Run!

30:00.326 --> 30:02.053
Run, run!

30:04.846 --> 30:06.416
Hey!

30:07.681 --> 30:10.084
Come on, you piece of shit!

30:13.346 --> 30:15.286
Come on!

30:17.710 --> 30:20.927
Tina! Barricade the door!

30:54.824 --> 30:57.205
- Tina, it's me, open the door!
- Mom?

30:57.285 --> 30:59.321
- Yeah, it's me, come on!
- I'm trying!

30:59.401 --> 31:01.224
- Come on!
- I'm trying!

31:01.305 --> 31:03.657
- Come on!
- I'm trying!

31:03.737 --> 31:06.151
- Come on!
- I'm trying!

31:06.721 --> 31:09.087
- Tina, it's me, open the door!
- Mom!

31:09.167 --> 31:12.063
- Yeah, come on, open the door!
- I'm trying!

31:44.922 --> 31:46.806
Come on, man.

31:47.086 --> 31:49.278
- You good?
- I'm great.

31:49.358 --> 31:51.628
God, then I'm not! Yeah.

31:53.997 --> 31:57.338
- Hey, will you come on?
- I'm coming, my cigarette won't light.

31:57.418 --> 31:58.992
Shh!

31:59.272 --> 32:01.376
It's 'cause you got it
on the wrong way, fool.

32:01.456 --> 32:03.265
Oh, yeah.

32:07.371 --> 32:10.989
- Hey, you think we're safe from your mom?
- Well, yeah, all the lights are out.

32:12.907 --> 32:14.758
Come on.

32:15.367 --> 32:19.708
If she tells... if she tells my parents
that we got drunk, I'm dead meat.

32:19.788 --> 32:22.945
Hey, will you relax?
Look, we hit my room, we're home free.

32:23.025 --> 32:24.444
Okay.

32:24.524 --> 32:27.700
Hey, Dana, hey, you still with me?

32:27.780 --> 32:30.192
Yep, I'm 100%, dude.

32:30.772 --> 32:33.948
Hey, yeah, those extra beers
weren't the smartest idea.

32:34.028 --> 32:35.997
Hey, who needs logic when you got fake IDs?

32:36.077 --> 32:37.959
Shut up!

32:38.637 --> 32:40.319
Next one.

32:41.183 --> 32:44.603
Yes. Now you gotta be quiet, okay, man?

32:44.683 --> 32:47.278
- Yeah, jeez! Okay.
- Shh, right, come on.

32:47.958 --> 32:49.855
Ah, God!

32:50.645 --> 32:53.463
- You all right there, buddy?
- Yeah, I'm good.

32:56.598 --> 32:58.812
- You're doing this really...
- Shh, quiet!

32:58.892 --> 33:00.439
Sorry.

33:01.838 --> 33:04.857
- Okay, come on.
- Okay, just...

33:08.562 --> 33:09.936
- You in?
- Yeah.

33:10.016 --> 33:11.568
Good.

33:12.761 --> 33:14.590
Whoa!

33:14.670 --> 33:18.113
And how'd you swing a joint
like this all to yourself?

33:18.693 --> 33:21.429
I thought you'd have to share a room
with your brothers or something.

33:21.509 --> 33:26.419
Whoa, whoa. Well, you know, I went with
the emotional blackmail angle on my mom.

33:26.499 --> 33:27.810
Had to be done.

33:27.890 --> 33:31.584
- Growing boy needs room to grow.
- Yeah, room to whack off, more like.

33:31.664 --> 33:34.520
- Shh!
- Look at this, ow!

33:35.000 --> 33:37.439
Hey, you, uh, you want a drink?

33:37.519 --> 33:40.379
- Yeah, you bet, why not?
- Here.

33:41.159 --> 33:42.913
Thanks, man.

33:43.823 --> 33:46.715
Hey, you're, like,
set for life down here, man!

33:46.795 --> 33:50.639
Yeah, almost, just need a TV set.

33:51.119 --> 33:54.952
Yeah. All I want is a car, you know?

33:56.032 --> 33:57.904
- Any car.
- Yeah.

33:57.984 --> 34:01.665
No more hitchin', go to the drive-in.

34:02.705 --> 34:06.045
Pick up a couple of girls, maybe.

34:06.125 --> 34:08.244
- You, pickin' up girls, really?
- Uh, yeah.

34:08.324 --> 34:10.110
Well, how old are they, 80?

34:10.190 --> 34:13.500
Hey, man, I'm not picky at my age, you know?

34:13.580 --> 34:15.704
Say, uh, you got a bathroom?

34:15.784 --> 34:18.817
It's about to get Niagara Falls
in these drawers, you know?

34:18.897 --> 34:22.116
Yeah, upstairs,
but you'd better piss outside.

34:22.696 --> 34:24.636
- Why?
- I don't want you waking my mom, okay?

34:24.716 --> 34:26.788
'Cause you're both gonna
get us in trouble! Come on!

34:26.868 --> 34:29.942
- Okay, nature it is, then.
- And keep quiet, okay?

34:30.022 --> 34:33.013
- Remember, low profile.
- Yeah, man, you the boss.

34:33.092 --> 34:35.433
- Shh, go on!
- Okay, hold my drink.

34:35.513 --> 34:38.225
- God!
- Let's see, can you give me a boost?

34:38.304 --> 34:40.355
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

34:42.641 --> 34:43.907
Here we are.

34:43.987 --> 34:47.621
We gotta find a better way
to get in and out of your house, okay?

34:47.702 --> 34:50.106
Right, go... go down there.

34:50.186 --> 34:51.694
Okay.

34:52.774 --> 34:54.955
- Shh!
- Sorry.

34:58.162 --> 35:01.500
- No, don't open it...
- No, no, I won't.

35:04.479 --> 35:06.328
Are they still out there?

35:07.162 --> 35:09.384
No, I don't think so.

35:10.286 --> 35:12.088
Then where are they?

35:26.803 --> 35:28.378
Ahh.

36:59.831 --> 37:01.332
Dana?

37:03.572 --> 37:05.118
Dana?

37:07.314 --> 37:08.865
Dana!

37:09.727 --> 37:11.529
Come on, man.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.488
Oh, you have got to be kidding me!

37:27.168 --> 37:28.594
You...

37:34.452 --> 37:37.886
- Is that a radio?
- I think so.

37:45.270 --> 37:48.379
They're coming, get me the bat!

37:53.378 --> 37:55.994
I want you to stand there.

37:56.274 --> 37:59.867
I'm gonna count to three and then
I want you to open the door.

37:59.947 --> 38:04.001
- No, Mom.
- Just do as I say, okay?

38:11.706 --> 38:13.557
You ready?

38:18.781 --> 38:19.876
One.

38:22.554 --> 38:23.605
Two.

38:28.946 --> 38:30.448
Three!

38:38.998 --> 38:44.292
Oh, my God, Johnny.
Johnny, I'm sorry, sweetheart!

38:44.372 --> 38:45.368
Johnny!

38:45.448 --> 38:48.136
- Johnny!
- Oh, sweetheart!

38:48.216 --> 38:50.571
Sweetheart, sweetheart?

38:50.651 --> 38:52.968
I'm so sorry.

38:53.048 --> 38:56.542
Johnny, are... are you okay, honey?

38:57.340 --> 38:59.384
Are you okay, Johnny?

39:00.064 --> 39:02.005
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry!

39:04.921 --> 39:08.811
Johnny, Johnny, I'm so sorry.

39:09.351 --> 39:12.578
Tina, Tina, help me get him up, come on!

39:15.608 --> 39:18.260
Mom! Mom! Mom!

40:00.986 --> 40:02.545
Johnny!

40:14.354 --> 40:15.993
Johnny!

40:17.456 --> 40:19.975
- Get up, Johnny!
- Go on!

40:22.071 --> 40:23.417
Pick it up.

40:25.975 --> 40:27.845
Go for it.

40:31.724 --> 40:34.182
- Johnny!
- Tell you what...

40:34.740 --> 40:37.823
...I'm gonna give you a fightin' chance.

40:42.428 --> 40:44.209
Now, we're even.

40:48.558 --> 40:50.390
Pick it up!

41:01.182 --> 41:05.293
Give it a try. Come on,
hit me, right there, hmm?

41:05.373 --> 41:07.277
Knock me out!

41:09.736 --> 41:12.389
Guess you just don't have it in ya, do ya?

41:13.769 --> 41:15.376
Give me the bat.

41:34.882 --> 41:36.453
Johnny!

42:03.519 --> 42:05.247
Johnny!

42:06.715 --> 42:08.745
No, Johnny!

42:13.929 --> 42:15.798
My God!

42:58.337 --> 43:00.166
Help me!

43:00.446 --> 43:02.712
Help, help!

43:03.553 --> 43:06.354
Help me, please, please call the police!

43:06.434 --> 43:08.273
They're in our house!

43:08.770 --> 43:10.616
Please, help me!

43:18.786 --> 43:20.998
Why won't you help me?

43:21.970 --> 43:23.795
Come on, you piece of shit!

44:02.565 --> 44:04.983
Drive, drive!

44:10.688 --> 44:13.206
You have to drive me to the Sheriff's
office, please! You have to help me.

44:13.286 --> 44:16.410
They're in our house! They're in our house,
they're going after my family!

44:16.490 --> 44:20.615
- Please, sir, you have to help me!
- Okay, okay, calm down, now.

44:20.695 --> 44:22.860
We'll get you to the Sheriff's office.

44:22.940 --> 44:26.795
- Thank you, thank you!
- Okay, just calm down. Don't worry.

44:26.875 --> 44:29.301
As soon as we get you
to the Sheriff's office...

44:29.381 --> 44:33.395
...I'm sure they'll drive you back
to your family at Cabin 28.

44:33.986 --> 44:36.196
Make sure everything's all right.

44:42.567 --> 44:44.368
How do you know where I live?

44:44.448 --> 44:46.492
Say what?

44:47.206 --> 44:51.805
I never told you my address.
How do you know where I live?

44:57.326 --> 45:00.365
No, no, no.

45:02.623 --> 45:04.162
No, I wanna get out!

45:39.012 --> 45:40.378
Ricky...

45:41.732 --> 45:44.014
Greg, Justin, oh...

45:44.927 --> 45:46.888
What have you done to them?

46:05.861 --> 46:07.369
Mom.

46:07.649 --> 46:09.761
We're gonna get through this.

46:11.294 --> 46:14.965
We're gonna get through this,
sweetheart, we are.

46:15.985 --> 46:17.692
Together, hmm?

46:21.395 --> 46:23.433
We're gonna get...

46:31.226 --> 46:32.968
No.

46:33.259 --> 46:35.373
No, no, no!

46:38.844 --> 46:40.378
Johnny!

46:42.871 --> 46:44.454
Johnny!

46:50.666 --> 46:53.085
No, no, no!

46:59.753 --> 47:02.571
No, no, no!

47:05.129 --> 47:07.617
Mom, Mom!

47:07.697 --> 47:10.159
No, no, no!

47:10.239 --> 47:11.794
No.

47:12.794 --> 47:14.341
No!

47:22.255 --> 47:25.206
No, no, no, no!

47:25.543 --> 47:28.381
No, no, no!

47:31.343 --> 47:33.956
Please don't, please don't!

47:34.036 --> 47:36.445
No, no, no!

47:40.843 --> 47:44.867
No, no, no, please don't, please don't!

47:48.750 --> 47:52.367
No, no, no, no! Don't!

47:52.847 --> 47:54.959
No, I'm pregnant!

48:01.796 --> 48:04.814
I'm... I'm sorry, Mom.

48:06.865 --> 48:09.376
I've... I've let you down!

48:09.456 --> 48:13.703
Tina, you would never let me down.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.805
Never let me down.

48:44.461 --> 48:47.904
Go on, just do it!

54:30.654 --> 54:33.195
Taking things back to that Saturday night...

54:33.275 --> 54:35.310
...what time did you go down to the bar?

54:35.390 --> 54:38.094
Uh, well, let's see now.

54:38.174 --> 54:40.719
Uh, we left the house in the, uh...

54:40.799 --> 54:42.959
...in the afternoon, my wife and I.

54:43.039 --> 54:45.616
Uh, John was, uh, he kept, uh...

54:45.696 --> 54:47.822
...we were in the bar until
around 1:00 in the morning...

54:47.902 --> 54:51.759
...but like I said, it wasn't real crowded,
but it was, you know, fairly busy...

54:51.839 --> 54:56.074
...but I didn't really notice
anything, uh, unusual.

54:56.919 --> 54:59.416
Except for one individual.

54:59.896 --> 55:05.364
Well, he came in around, uh, 10:30, 11:00.

55:06.144 --> 55:07.987
I never seen him before.

55:08.587 --> 55:10.413
Can you give me a description of this guy?

55:10.493 --> 55:14.548
Yeah, uh, he was, uh, in a T-shirt and jeans.

55:14.628 --> 55:18.417
Uh, he was wearin'
a buck knife, uh, long hair.

55:18.497 --> 55:22.383
5'7", 5'8", uh, extremely long hair...

55:22.463 --> 55:25.941
...uh, tied back in a... in a ponytail...

55:26.021 --> 55:30.505
...and that individual, he certainly
didn't look like he belonged, you know?

55:30.585 --> 55:32.716
- He was a white man?
- Uh-huh.

55:32.796 --> 55:34.544
And about how old?

55:34.624 --> 55:38.691
Uh, I'd say, uh, early 20s, 24, 25.

55:39.329 --> 55:41.184
And he had a buck knife?

55:41.664 --> 55:44.681
Well, he carried that all out
in the open, so I...

55:44.761 --> 55:47.960
...I figured he was...
he was ready for trouble, you know?

55:49.090 --> 55:53.714
Okay, so what time did you, uh,
go home from the bar?

55:53.794 --> 55:58.292
Uh, we left the bar around, uh, 2:00.

55:59.427 --> 56:03.600
- You go straight to bed?
- Yeah, yeah, I went to bed...

56:03.680 --> 56:07.186
...uh, woke up around 3:00,
you know, stoke the fire.

56:07.266 --> 56:09.138
Nothin' unusual woke you up, you...

56:09.218 --> 56:12.444
I usually stoke the fire around 3:00, Deputy.

56:13.442 --> 56:15.287
Was your wife still in bed when you got back?

56:15.367 --> 56:18.195
Yep, she was a dead head.

56:18.275 --> 56:20.566
Sleepin', slept right through.

56:25.795 --> 56:30.324
Um, our problem now is, uh,
sorting fact from fiction with the kids.

56:32.390 --> 56:35.228
You know your stepson
Justin was there, right?

56:36.255 --> 56:37.972
Of course, I do, Deputy.

56:38.052 --> 56:41.652
Obviously, we're trying to determine what,
if anything, he might have seen.

56:41.732 --> 56:44.916
Um, has he tried to describe
or recreate anything?

56:44.996 --> 56:47.956
Yeah. Yes, he did.

56:48.036 --> 56:51.953
He tried to recreate it at my place
yesterday, uh, the wife watching...

56:52.033 --> 56:54.108
...I watched him go right through it.

56:54.188 --> 56:57.378
So, he, uh, you know,
he's tellin' Casey to, uh...

56:57.458 --> 57:00.211
...uh, hold his arm, like he's got a knife...

57:00.291 --> 57:03.982
...trying to stab it, but...
but from what I understand...

57:04.062 --> 57:08.253
...um, those folks were killed
with a hammer, so I...

57:08.333 --> 57:11.831
...I get to thinking he was
just play-acting, you know?

57:12.996 --> 57:15.732
Was he in a position
the following morning where...

57:15.812 --> 57:17.933
...if the deputies had left
the door open for a moment...

57:18.013 --> 57:20.788
...he might've looked in there
and seen the female victim?

57:20.868 --> 57:23.414
Uh-uh, no way.

57:23.494 --> 57:26.101
Security was real tight that morning,

57:26.181 --> 57:30.102
...so, you know, I get to thinking
whether or not he saw anything at all.

57:30.182 --> 57:33.686
Do you think there's a possibility
that he could have?

57:33.766 --> 57:36.535
Well, I know that he does sleep light...

57:36.615 --> 57:39.573
...and he does have trouble
sleeping sometimes...

57:39.653 --> 57:43.770
...but, hell, look at this now.
Just put yourself in their position.

57:43.850 --> 57:48.055
You're lying there next to your buddy
and you're giggling and this and that...

57:48.135 --> 57:51.959
...well, hell, sure, of course
he could've been awake that night...

57:52.039 --> 57:57.223
...and, uh, he could've noticed
something without me detecting him.

57:58.119 --> 57:59.671
Mmm-hmm.

58:00.051 --> 58:01.635
Um...

58:02.215 --> 58:03.575
Uh, the fact...

58:03.655 --> 58:06.939
...the fact that, uh,
those kids were in there...

58:07.019 --> 58:08.667
...and, um...

58:08.747 --> 58:12.920
...the person that did this...
person or persons...

58:13.000 --> 58:16.143
...I was just wondering,
why didn't they bother with those kids?

58:17.323 --> 58:20.167
Now that's overkill, right there, you know?

58:20.747 --> 58:23.703
You know, Deputy, you know if I was, uh...

58:23.783 --> 58:26.067
...if I was gonna kill somebody...

58:26.147 --> 58:30.751
...I'd go in there blam, blam, blam,
just get the job done, get going.

58:30.831 --> 58:33.017
There's no sense in going
any further than that, right?

58:33.097 --> 58:35.928
You get in, get going, get the job done...

58:36.808 --> 58:40.275
...well, it just, uh, people go that far...

58:40.805 --> 58:43.064
...it does make you think, uh...

58:43.144 --> 58:46.170
...why didn't they hurt those other kids?

58:47.429 --> 58:50.472
That's, uh, something
we've been trying to find out.

58:51.052 --> 58:53.808
And then we got the other
factors involved as well...

58:53.888 --> 58:56.112
...uh, got the missing girl...

58:57.067 --> 58:58.601
...Tina...

58:59.081 --> 59:02.585
- ...why would somebody wanna snatch her?
- Now I've been thinking about that, too.

59:02.665 --> 59:06.413
Now, I know that girl is the father's
favorite kid. I've never met the father...

59:06.493 --> 59:09.529
...it's just what I've heard
from a few conversations now...

59:09.609 --> 59:12.669
...but apparently, he lives
in Connecticut, so they say.

59:12.749 --> 59:15.322
Now, just hear me out, Deputy.

59:15.402 --> 59:19.279
Maybe, just maybe,
the father was there that night.

59:19.859 --> 59:22.234
Maybe those boys tried to stop him...

59:22.314 --> 59:24.384
...so he had to take them out, too.

59:25.004 --> 59:28.730
Hell, we even thought that maybe Dana did it.

59:28.810 --> 59:32.107
Do you know, that boy
is mentally disturbed...

59:32.187 --> 59:35.931
...and both those boys are, uh...
they've been experimenting with drugs.

59:36.011 --> 59:38.558
That's a very well-known fact
around Keddie, get that down.

59:38.638 --> 59:40.954
What kind of drugs, um, weed or...

59:41.034 --> 59:44.810
Well, I don't know, weed, pills,
maybe more, I don't know.

59:44.890 --> 59:47.840
Okay, so if you think
they were into heavy drugs,

59:47.920 --> 59:50.618
...do you reckon it could've
been a drug-related hit?

59:50.698 --> 59:53.883
Shit, now that's the thing right there!

59:53.963 --> 59:57.755
But dealers dishing out street justice
typically just use a gun.

59:57.835 --> 01:00:01.371
I mean, a hammer
was a big weapon in this case.

01:00:01.451 --> 01:00:04.483
You know, uh... my hammer's missing.

01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:07.703
Is it now?

01:00:09.325 --> 01:00:12.904
Yeah, I usually keep it out
front the cabin, but, uh...

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:14.717
...I haven't found that.

01:00:14.797 --> 01:00:17.851
This is another thing I've been
thinking about, Deputy.

01:00:17.931 --> 01:00:20.381
Now, why don't you think about this?

01:00:20.461 --> 01:00:21.933
This guy...

01:00:22.013 --> 01:00:25.305
...now maybe he could've walked
past my cabin, yeah...

01:00:25.385 --> 01:00:29.826
...now if he done that, well, hell,
he could've taken my hammer...

01:00:29.906 --> 01:00:32.427
...but why in the hell not my hatchet?

01:00:32.507 --> 01:00:35.961
I would've thought that was
a much better way to kill somebody.

01:00:36.141 --> 01:00:37.991
Gets you thinking.

01:00:38.864 --> 01:00:40.505
How?

01:00:40.585 --> 01:00:42.305
How can it be done...

01:00:42.385 --> 01:00:45.062
...getting in and out...

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.108
...without anybody noticing, hmm?

01:00:47.188 --> 01:00:50.468
Strangest damn thing I ever heard of.

01:00:51.526 --> 01:00:53.400
Sure is.

01:00:54.158 --> 01:00:55.518
Um...

01:00:55.598 --> 01:00:59.268
...is there anything else you can tell me
to help with the investigation?

01:01:01.971 --> 01:01:03.510
No.

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:08.149
No, I can't think of anything at all,
Deputy, but... but if I do...

01:01:08.229 --> 01:01:11.422
...I'll... I'll be sure to let you boys know.

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:14.466
After all, I am a veteran.

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:16.351
Well, you knew that, right?

01:01:16.431 --> 01:01:18.210
Bo too, uh...

01:01:18.512 --> 01:01:20.192
...hell, that's how we met.

01:01:20.272 --> 01:01:23.757
I know. Oh, um, one more thing.

01:01:24.684 --> 01:01:26.631
How well did you know Sue?

01:01:27.791 --> 01:01:32.126
More my old lady's friend than mine,
but, uh, from what I understand...

01:01:32.206 --> 01:01:36.124
...she didn't have a real good handle
on that family, if you know what I mean.

01:01:36.204 --> 01:01:39.541
No, I don't, you're gonna
have to explain it to me.

01:01:39.621 --> 01:01:44.192
Yeah, don't worry about that
now, Deputy. It's all over, hell...

01:01:44.272 --> 01:01:45.914
...she was a nobody.

01:01:51.445 --> 01:01:53.343
What's so funny?

01:01:53.967 --> 01:01:56.380
Well, you know, I'm...

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.076
...I'm kind of a nobody myself, Deputy.

01:01:59.156 --> 01:02:03.967
Nobody ever took me seriously
or give me a sideways glance before.

01:02:05.425 --> 01:02:06.965
Hell...

01:02:07.445 --> 01:02:09.314
...look at this now.

01:02:09.394 --> 01:02:12.402
All important and informative...

01:02:12.982 --> 01:02:16.272
...maybe now I'm kind of somebody, right?

01:02:53.715 --> 01:02:57.273
- I heard you talked with Marty today.
- Sure did.

01:02:57.353 --> 01:03:01.589
- Got it all on here.
- Better give me that.

01:03:02.066 --> 01:03:03.550
Safekeeping.

01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:05.695
Uh, okay?

01:03:06.675 --> 01:03:09.752
I didn't get a great feeling about that guy.

01:03:10.332 --> 01:03:13.380
I think we should pursue it,
at least talk to him some more.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:17.664
Let's not be too hasty. We got a few
other lines of inquiry to exhaust...

01:03:17.744 --> 01:03:21.640
...before we point the dirty end
of the stick at a buddy of mine.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.948
Well, we gotta bring in his friend, Bo.

01:03:24.028 --> 01:03:26.029
We'll bring him in, sure...

01:03:26.609 --> 01:03:28.964
...but we gotta be careful here.

01:03:29.044 --> 01:03:32.269
We're gonna do everything by
the book, but there's a point where...

01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:35.293
...you turn every stone upside-down, well...

01:03:36.073 --> 01:03:38.501
...you can make a hell
of a mess in this town.

01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:42.340
- What are you saying?
- Once you start pulling on that thread...

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:46.021
...a whole lotta things that hold
this town together unravel.

01:03:46.101 --> 01:03:50.156
We could end up with a lot of
guilty people, you understand?

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:54.285
Well, what about Marilyn's kid, Justin?

01:03:54.365 --> 01:03:57.669
- What about him?
- Well, he says he saw the murderers.

01:03:57.749 --> 01:04:01.390
He's just a kid, there ain't much
weight to what he has to say.

01:04:03.738 --> 01:04:06.541
I heard the Department
of Justice is comin' to town.

01:04:06.621 --> 01:04:08.653
That's right.

01:04:08.733 --> 01:04:11.466
Well, we, uh, we all good there, or...

01:04:12.246 --> 01:04:15.685
We've got some understanding
friends in the Department.

01:04:15.765 --> 01:04:18.189
They won't be pulling on any threads.

01:04:18.871 --> 01:04:20.440
Anyway...

01:04:21.794 --> 01:04:23.828
...let's grab some lunch.

01:04:25.187 --> 01:04:27.041
You coming?

01:04:30.391 --> 01:04:31.929
Yeah.

01:04:48.564 --> 01:04:51.609
So Marilyn had already left the bar earlier?

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:54.801
- Yeah.
- So it's just you and Marty...

01:04:54.881 --> 01:04:57.753
- ...left at the bar?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:04:57.833 --> 01:05:00.037
Did you walk home?

01:05:00.667 --> 01:05:01.928
That's right.

01:05:02.008 --> 01:05:05.929
You have to walk past Cabin 28
to get to 26 down the road there.

01:05:06.009 --> 01:05:09.483
Did you see any activity
around Cabin 28 at that time?

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.465
Nothing unusual.

01:05:11.545 --> 01:05:15.596
No lights, cars, traffic, anything?

01:05:15.676 --> 01:05:17.319
Nope.

01:05:18.425 --> 01:05:19.734
Okay.

01:05:21.877 --> 01:05:24.130
See, that's what I find surprising.

01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:27.791
You see, I'm a very light sleeper.

01:05:29.082 --> 01:05:31.990
If there'd been, uh, screaming and stuff...

01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:36.612
- ...I'm sure I would've heard it.
- You didn't hear anything that night?

01:05:37.561 --> 01:05:39.459
Nothing at all.

01:05:41.498 --> 01:05:43.573
When you got back to the house...

01:05:44.153 --> 01:05:47.027
...was Marilyn still up, or in bed, or what?

01:05:47.107 --> 01:05:48.928
No, she was up.

01:05:57.855 --> 01:06:00.532
Okay, then, I guess that's it.

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:04.943
Wanna thank you for coming in, Bo.

01:06:05.023 --> 01:06:08.092
No problem, Sheriff, always happy to help.
