? The law is equal
and justice is blind ?

01:25:47.957 --> 01:25:50.125
? But this cop's justice
is one of a kind ?

01:25:50.210 --> 01:25:52.544
? He's homicidal and maladjusted ?

01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:54.713
? But when he busts in,
your ass is busted ?

01:25:54.798 --> 01:25:56.715
? You won't get a ticket
or pay your fine ?

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:59.009

with Frankenstein ?

? He's big and ugly with a busted jaw ?

01:26:01.304 --> 01:26:03.597

from this man in biue ?

01:26:05.892 --> 01:26:08.018
? And don't call a cop
'cause he'll snuff him too ?

01:26:08.103 --> 01:26:09.978

? He's the
ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-maniac ?

and you hear that sound ?

01:26:14.609 --> 01:26:16.819
? It probably means
that Cordell's around ?

01:26:16.903 --> 01:26:18.904
