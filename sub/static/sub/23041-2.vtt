02:30.750 --> 02:32.666
[woman] You want me to take over?

02:32.750 --> 02:36.666

-One, two, three, and...

02:39.500 --> 02:41.958
I want to take Sara to the park.
You want to come?

02:42.666 --> 02:45.041
No, I'm gonna pass if you don't mind.

02:45.875 --> 02:48.000

Hopefully he'll sleep through the night
one of these days.

04:00.625 --> 04:03.083
Yeah, well, you're past that.
How old's Sara now?

-Yes.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.791
And Sara, right? Follow me.

05:27.125 --> 05:30.000
You have a recommendation,
so Sara will be part of our trial period.

05:30.083 --> 05:32.250
-Well, it's been tested though, right?
-Of course.

05:32.333 --> 05:36.208
-I mean, she's not, like, a guinea pig.
-It's all fully tested, perfectly safe.

-[Marie] Uh-huh.
-Do you wanna go up? Yeah!

05:49.125 --> 05:53.541
Response so far is just incredible.
The sense of security, peace of mind.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.458

they're inspirational.

[Marie] Oh, look at that.

all you have to do is tap here,

How is she eating?

[sighs] Man, she's picky.
Um, she hates greens, so--

07:30.500 --> 07:32.833
You might want to think about
nutritional supplements.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.375
-OK.

07:35.458 --> 07:38.250

07:47.916 --> 07:49.333
[Marie] That's amazing.

07:49.416 --> 07:52.375
Mommy! It's funny.

07:52.875 --> 07:55.416
And there are parental controls
you can apply to that.

07:55.833 --> 07:58.333
-Uh, controls?
-Content limitations.

07:58.416 --> 08:03.583
If she witnesses something that causes
her cortisol levels to rise, like stress,

08:03.666 --> 08:07.125
it can kind of paint out
whatever's triggering it.

because you wouldn't get a baby gate.

-I can get it. [exhales deeply]

13:19.750 --> 13:20.625
[grandfather coughs]

13:21.125 --> 13:23.250
-You good?
-[grandfather] Quit bugging me. Jeez.

13:23.333 --> 13:24.583
[Marie] There you go.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.291
[grandfather] It's warm in here.

13:29.750 --> 13:31.333
I don't need that.

13:39.291 --> 13:40.500
Give me that.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
[tablet beeps]

13:44.416 --> 13:47.541
-[chattering on TV]
-Hey, Sara! One cookie.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.583
[Marie] Bad for your teeth.

13:57.625 --> 13:58.625
[grandfather] Thanks.

14:37.958 --> 14:39.458
[Marie sniffles]

14:52.958 --> 14:54.500
What color for the hair?

14:56.458 --> 14:57.291
Mom?

14:58.125 --> 14:59.708
Uh, whatever you want.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.541
But I'd say brunette.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.250
[barks loudly]

15:12.958 --> 15:15.291
[muffled barking]

15:15.375 --> 15:18.000
[continues barking loudly]

15:18.083 --> 15:20.541
[children talking]

15:23.416 --> 15:26.083
[boy 1] He's got his arms in the air.
He's given up.

15:26.166 --> 15:29.416
-He's got a stick out and... [gasps]
-[boy 2 groans]

15:29.500 --> 15:33.666
-He just, like, pounds on him.
-Turn it off, Trick. It's gross.

15:33.750 --> 15:34.791
What is it?

15:35.291 --> 15:37.916
Great. The walking snitch.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.750
-[girl] She never snitches.
-[boy 2] She's just weird.

15:41.666 --> 15:45.125
-I want to know what you're watching.
-What do you care, chip-head?

15:45.208 --> 15:48.250
It's parental advisory. You're locked out.

15:48.333 --> 15:49.708
I want to know.

15:50.291 --> 15:53.541
You're better off not seeing it.
Wish I never did.

15:54.166 --> 15:56.291
What if I tell you what's in it?
That work?

15:58.500 --> 16:02.250
So, he brings it down, like, wham!
There's all this blood.

16:03.541 --> 16:04.416
You seen much blood?

16:05.208 --> 16:08.166
It's like juice. Thick, red juice.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.375
Then the guy on the ground is all,
like, "Hell, no!"

16:10.458 --> 16:12.375
And he keeps... [muffled speech]

16:15.000 --> 16:17.166
[muffled speech continues]

17:19.541 --> 17:22.541
[Marie] Oh, it's too much.
I'm fine to have my face on the flier,

17:22.625 --> 17:24.375
but on the poster, it's like,
"Look at me."

17:24.458 --> 17:26.083
[tablet rings]

17:31.291 --> 17:33.250
Sara, what are you doing?

17:33.666 --> 17:35.125
[groans] Sara!

17:35.208 --> 17:37.208
[breathes heavily]

17:40.583 --> 17:42.208
What's happening in this picture?

17:44.833 --> 17:46.708
[doctor]<i> Are they happy or...</i>

17:47.500 --> 17:49.000
[Sara]<i> They're talking.</i>

17:49.916 --> 17:51.166
[doctor]<i> Just talking?</i>

17:52.333 --> 17:53.833
[Sara]<i> I don't know what about.</i>

17:55.250 --> 17:57.000
[doctor]<i> OK. Next one.</i> [sighs]

17:57.750 --> 18:00.333
-[doctor]<i> How about that one?</i>
-[Sara]<i> I don't know.</i>

18:01.250 --> 18:02.208
[doctor]<i> Is she happy?</i>

18:05.291 --> 18:08.125
[Marie]
So is this, like, an autism thing?

18:08.541 --> 18:12.708
The spectrum is wide,
but in my opinion, she's not on it.

18:12.791 --> 18:15.416
But what about the pencils,
like, self-harm?

18:15.500 --> 18:17.500
And these pictures are... [sighs]

18:17.583 --> 18:21.000
Has Sara ever shown
any undue anger before now?

18:22.500 --> 18:23.666
No.

18:23.750 --> 18:28.500
Well, then consider this part experiment,
part acting out, for your benefit.

18:28.583 --> 18:29.875
[Marie sighs]

18:30.250 --> 18:33.375
The Arkangel never launched nationwide.
It was banned in Europe.

18:33.458 --> 18:35.583
It'll be pulled here, too, by the fall.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.541
I did this to her.

18:41.458 --> 18:44.958
You can't remove the implant,
but you can get rid of the parental unit.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.541
The screen.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.875
Just throw it away. Problem solved.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.750
[tablet beeps]<i> Filter off.</i>

18:58.375 --> 18:59.625
<i>Goodbye.</i>

19:02.333 --> 19:03.375
[tablet shuts down]

19:05.375 --> 19:08.916
You're gonna be on your own today. OK?

19:09.500 --> 19:10.750
No Arkangel.

19:13.541 --> 19:15.375
The system isn't gonna be on.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.208
OK? So, no fuzzy pictures.

19:19.333 --> 19:21.041
And you won't see me?

19:21.125 --> 19:22.583
[sighs] I won't see you.

19:23.208 --> 19:26.791
But, you do not have to be afraid.
I'm right down the street.

19:29.291 --> 19:32.791
-You won't know if something happens?
-Nothing is gonna happen.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.458
It's important that we do this.

19:36.916 --> 19:38.416
[whispers] You're gonna be fine.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.875
[exhales] Be good, sweetie.

20:06.458 --> 20:07.750
[sighs]

20:07.833 --> 20:09.625

20:22.541 --> 20:23.666

[children laughing, chattering]

20:59.208 --> 21:00.541
[child groans]

21:03.625 --> 21:06.833
[woman] OK! OK, this is enough!

21:06.916 --> 21:10.666
-[boy] Don't touch my stuff again, Trick.
-Yeah? I'll do what I want.

21:29.875 --> 21:31.000
What do you want?

21:33.041 --> 21:34.291
Are you OK?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.375
Yeah, sure.

21:39.666 --> 21:43.791
My dad's gonna see this and then bust it
all over again, 'cause I got in trouble.

21:49.916 --> 21:51.416
Ever seen a bust lip before?

21:52.708 --> 21:55.333
Mm... Not till now.

21:55.916 --> 21:57.833
She turned the system off.

21:59.666 --> 22:00.583
[Trick]<i> OK...</i>

22:00.666 --> 22:03.375
-This is porn. Like, people doing it.
-[woman moaning]

22:03.458 --> 22:06.625
They can't make babies that way.
They have to do it different for that.

22:06.708 --> 22:09.458
-[shouting]
-So this one's got a hacksaw

22:09.541 --> 22:12.041
and he's gotta cut his own foot off.

22:12.125 --> 22:14.250
-So, the terrorist guy...
-[shouting]

22:14.333 --> 22:16.291
...OK, OK, keep an eye on the knife.

22:16.375 --> 22:17.666
See?

22:17.750 --> 22:23.458
-He's gonna take his whole head off!
-[men scream]

22:28.000 --> 22:29.166
[Marie] Be good, sweetie.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.833
[barks]

23:17.958 --> 23:19.625
Hey. Good boy, Petey.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.708
You hang on in there.

23:27.541 --> 23:29.666
[whirs]

23:31.333 --> 23:35.333
-You added something.
-Oh, it's like a new kind of probiotic.

23:35.416 --> 23:37.875
-It keeps your stools firm.
-Oh, Jesus, Mom.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.916
[rock music playing]

23:40.000 --> 23:44.416
Oh, you've got to be kidding!
When was the last time you went anywhere?

23:44.500 --> 23:47.416
That's not dancing. [laughs]

23:47.833 --> 23:49.166
[Sara]<i> She said he was English.</i>

23:49.250 --> 23:52.041
-He's not English.
-He said "cup of tea," or something.

23:52.125 --> 23:55.083
Doesn't mean anything.
Susan's an idiot. [chuckles]

23:55.166 --> 23:56.208
Hey, it's Trick.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.333
Holy fuck, he's got wheels!

24:00.000 --> 24:01.041
[girl] Yo, Trick!

24:01.750 --> 24:03.583
Hey, guys. What's up?

24:03.666 --> 24:05.875
-Interesting hair.
-Shut up.

24:05.958 --> 24:07.416
I'm fucking with you. It's cool.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.500
[laughs]

24:09.000 --> 24:11.083
-How are you doing?
-Didn't know you cared.

24:11.666 --> 24:12.958
Maybe I don't.

24:14.416 --> 24:16.500
-You a delivery guy now?
-Kinda, of sorts.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.208
-Shut up.
-[laughs]

24:18.291 --> 24:21.666
Hmm... So intriguing. I gotta go.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.166
Hey, uh, we're headed to Lake Dalston
later if you girls want to hang.

24:27.208 --> 24:28.375
We'll think about it.

24:28.791 --> 24:31.458
-[Trick] It'll be fun.
-[boy] Why don't you just come?

24:31.541 --> 24:32.750
Come on!

24:34.166 --> 24:37.083
[girl] Like my dad's gonna let me
set foot in Trick's van.

24:37.166 --> 24:40.375
[Sara] Look, we tell our folks
we're at Reilly's for movie night.

24:40.458 --> 24:41.625
Oh, come on, it'll work.

24:41.708 --> 24:43.208
It's worth a shot, I guess.

24:45.125 --> 24:46.500
So, anyhow...

24:47.416 --> 24:50.666
-You and, uh, Trick, huh?
-What?

24:51.875 --> 24:54.083
[scoffs] I'm not gonna do anything.

24:54.791 --> 24:58.625
-Yeah, OK. [laughs] Sure.

Not for long. I was gonna go to Reilly's
with Meryl. Movie night.

25:10.083 --> 25:12.208
Oh, I thought movie night
was on Wednesday.

25:12.291 --> 25:14.541
Her mom's got guests over then,
so we're doing tonight.

25:14.625 --> 25:17.083
Gonna watch some vintage thing.

25:20.791 --> 25:23.666
Um, be home, like, 11:30.
Her mom will drop me back.

25:23.750 --> 25:26.166
Well, I might be heading out, too. So...

25:26.250 --> 25:28.541
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

-What?

29:44.208 --> 29:45.875
You said you'd never done that before.

29:48.541 --> 29:50.208
No way you never done that before.

29:51.541 --> 29:52.916

Oh, yeah?

She's being a dork about it, so...

33:26.833 --> 33:29.041
All right. What do you think?

33:30.125 --> 33:32.291
OK, that's awesome,
but I can't put that on the van.

33:32.375 --> 33:34.791
-Why not?
-Well, A, it's not my van,

33:34.875 --> 33:37.791
and, B, it's better if I'm anonymous.

33:38.625 --> 33:41.000
For your special delivery?

-Any what?

I'm not dumb. I know what you sell.

You got any?

33:52.541 --> 33:54.083
It's not for you.

-[giggles] Under the seat... with tape.
-Sara, come here.

-Hey, Sara, give me that.
-Duct tape.

Give me that. No, no, no.

-[squeals] I bet it's in the pocket.
-Come on, give me that. No!

34:06.250 --> 34:08.666
I'm making a little money on the side
so I can move out, OK?

34:08.750 --> 34:10.208
It's not like I use that shit.

34:10.541 --> 34:11.708
Have you tried it?

34:12.375 --> 34:14.791
Of course I've tried it but, I mean,
it's not even good coke,

34:14.875 --> 34:15.875
it's, like, average.

-under their gum, bottom gum.
-OK.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.458
OK, if she calls you, you hang up.

you tell her to get away.
