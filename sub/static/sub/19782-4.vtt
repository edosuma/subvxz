00:02.089 --> 00:05.359
You and Laurie Ann were looking
at the situation with the fire,

00:05.362 --> 00:06.865
and I would like to help with that.

00:06.867 --> 00:10.368
I don't want this to come between us.

00:10.370 --> 00:12.856
I've been getting IVF treatments.

00:12.859 --> 00:14.572
I can't be the donor, Kimara.

00:14.574 --> 00:16.407
I'm sorry.

00:16.409 --> 00:19.444
I'm pregnant again. And
I'm not gonna keep it.

00:19.774 --> 00:21.329

00:27.743 --> 00:29.053
I seen you going soft

00:29.055 --> 00:30.822
for that fool you brought to the farm.

00:30.824 --> 00:32.023
I'm not soft.

00:32.025 --> 00:34.192
You ain't got to do
nothing but make them work.

00:45.405 --> 00:47.505
Tell me about Teo.

00:47.507 --> 00:50.041
Teo is my son.

00:50.044 --> 00:52.977
He's... He's 17.

00:52.979 --> 00:55.079
He has a sense of humor.

00:55.081 --> 00:57.815
He loves to make people laugh.

00:57.817 --> 01:00.552
I used to, uh...

01:00.555 --> 01:02.805
I-I didn't think people
would take him serious,

01:02.808 --> 01:07.992
that he would get into trouble
for messing around too much.

01:07.994 --> 01:11.062
But he, uh...

01:11.064 --> 01:12.697
he just likes to make people happy.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.568
That's not what I meant.

01:16.570 --> 01:18.970
I meant, does he have
any distinguishing marks,

01:18.972 --> 01:20.605
scars, tattoos,

01:20.607 --> 01:23.074
anything that would help
us to identify his body?

02:40.987 --> 02:44.088
The body was pulled from the river.

02:47.394 --> 02:50.161
Where... Where is he?

02:50.163 --> 02:52.430
Probably cremated.

02:52.432 --> 02:54.699
All unclaimed bodies are cremated.

02:54.701 --> 02:57.902
We might have the ashes. You want them?

02:57.904 --> 03:01.172
There's a fee for the work
done, but you can have them.

03:20.527 --> 03:23.194
What does it take to get out of here?

03:23.196 --> 03:26.230
How much do I have to pay back?

03:26.232 --> 03:29.100
How much do I owe?

03:29.102 --> 03:31.035
$363.

03:33.540 --> 03:36.067
No, that's... That's not right.

03:36.070 --> 03:40.812
The farm covers your room,
food, work supplies...

03:40.814 --> 03:45.149
I... I made 40 bucks on Friday.

03:45.151 --> 03:46.984
You can add that.

03:46.986 --> 03:49.854
Added it. You still owe.

03:51.560 --> 03:54.627
Work faster, earn more.

03:58.631 --> 04:00.631
Can you just help me out a little bit?

04:00.633 --> 04:02.667
Work faster.

04:17.784 --> 04:19.117
What do you want?

04:22.122 --> 04:24.622
It's Coy.

04:24.624 --> 04:26.991
I-I know who it is. What do you want?

04:29.295 --> 04:32.797
I... I need some money.

04:36.302 --> 04:37.835
Aidan?

04:40.039 --> 04:41.539
Aidan?

04:48.982 --> 04:52.150
You told me you got a job.

04:52.152 --> 04:54.652
They, uh...

04:54.654 --> 04:56.988
They take my money.

04:56.990 --> 04:59.323
- They... they don't...
- I'm sick of this, you know?

04:59.325 --> 05:02.326
It's the same thing from you every time.

05:02.328 --> 05:04.529
Do you even care what you do to mom?

05:06.733 --> 05:09.600
I care. I...

05:11.738 --> 05:14.572
I got a job.

05:14.574 --> 05:16.908
I'm working. I'm
working as hard as I can.

05:16.910 --> 05:18.910
I'm...

05:18.912 --> 05:20.912
I'm clean.

05:20.914 --> 05:22.580
I'm so clean.

05:22.582 --> 05:25.082
I just...

05:25.084 --> 05:27.084
I just need a little bit of money.

05:27.086 --> 05:29.086
I just need some
money, and I'll be okay.

05:33.593 --> 05:35.626
Aidan?

05:42.302 --> 05:43.601
Aidan?

05:43.603 --> 05:45.403
Don't call me no more.

05:55.415 --> 05:56.981
I want an abortion.

05:59.352 --> 06:01.319
Okay.

06:01.321 --> 06:03.120
Have you ever had one before?

06:03.122 --> 06:04.922
Yes.

06:04.924 --> 06:06.858
Where?

06:06.860 --> 06:10.628
D.C.

06:10.630 --> 06:13.231
How far along are you?

06:13.233 --> 06:16.067
I don't know for sure.

06:17.871 --> 06:20.004
I know someone at the courthouse.

06:20.006 --> 06:22.773
I can see about getting you in.

06:22.775 --> 06:25.376
In for what?

06:25.378 --> 06:28.112
The procedure needs to be approved.

06:28.114 --> 06:29.914
In a court?

06:29.916 --> 06:32.683
You're underage.

06:32.685 --> 06:34.318
You have to have a
waiver from the judge,

06:34.320 --> 06:36.621
or permission from your parents.

06:36.623 --> 06:39.257
Do you want to call them?

06:45.899 --> 06:47.531
I didn't have to go through this in D.C.

06:47.533 --> 06:48.833
I just went to Planned Parenthood.

06:48.835 --> 06:50.968
Well, this isn't D.C.

06:50.970 --> 06:53.871
This is North Carolina.

06:53.873 --> 06:55.973
Do you want to go in front of the judge,

06:55.975 --> 06:58.476
or do you want to call your parents?

07:03.316 --> 07:05.449
I'll see about getting
us in front of a judge

07:05.451 --> 07:07.285
as soon as I can.

07:20.466 --> 07:22.099
With the advantage plan,

07:22.101 --> 07:24.235
you're covered for up
to three egg retrievals

07:24.237 --> 07:27.705
and the transfer of all embryos
until you take home a child.

07:29.275 --> 07:32.276
What's the interest rate?

07:37.216 --> 07:40.017
We can tailor the payments
to fit your budget.

07:40.019 --> 07:42.987
If the treatment doesn't take again,

07:42.989 --> 07:47.925
um, am I still responsible
for the full amount?

07:47.926 --> 07:50.560
The core plan costs a little more.

07:50.563 --> 07:52.530
But if the treatment is unsuccessful,

07:52.532 --> 07:54.031
you are eligible to receive a refund.

07:54.033 --> 07:57.234
Eligible? It's not guaranteed?

07:58.871 --> 08:03.541
If you or your doctor determine
that the treatments are futile,

08:03.542 --> 08:06.209
you will receive a refund.

08:06.212 --> 08:09.380
Meaning if I can't have a child.

08:15.834 --> 08:18.824
What's happening now, it's not right.

08:18.827 --> 08:21.238
There's a whole lot
of hurt going around.

08:21.241 --> 08:23.008
Have you... Are you seeing anyone?

08:23.010 --> 08:25.110
Did you... Did you try
to get into a program?

08:25.112 --> 08:29.815
It's not me. It's... Not just me.

08:31.385 --> 08:33.652
I went to go see our dad yesterday.

08:33.654 --> 08:35.886
- Oh.
- Jeanette, I got turned away.

08:35.889 --> 08:38.289
They wouldn't let me see him.

08:38.292 --> 08:39.791
As sick as that man is,

08:39.794 --> 08:41.979
- Laurie Ann has got this grip.
- Oh, you know Laurie Ann is just a...

08:41.981 --> 08:44.162
And she's ruining every
chance I have to see my father.

08:44.164 --> 08:45.630
What... wait.

08:45.632 --> 08:47.566
You know Laurie Ann
won't let you see him?

08:47.568 --> 08:49.167
Yes.

08:49.169 --> 08:50.635
Why?

08:50.637 --> 08:53.705
Because I care about
what happens on the farm,

08:53.707 --> 08:55.474
and she doesn't.

08:55.476 --> 08:57.409
Because I'm sick of seeing people die

08:57.411 --> 08:59.678
so the... the farm can make money.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.279
And... And she's scared as hell

09:01.281 --> 09:04.783
I'm gonna say something to Dad.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.920
Will you talk to them?

09:12.024 --> 09:14.292
When you wanted to go to that... that...

09:14.294 --> 09:18.096
That workers' rally, I
stood with you, Jeanette.

09:18.098 --> 09:21.166
Nobody else in the family would.

09:21.168 --> 09:22.300
I did.

09:22.302 --> 09:24.903
And now I'm paying for it.

09:24.905 --> 09:28.640
I'm asking, please talk to them for me.

09:42.356 --> 09:45.590
You're shady.

09:48.032 --> 09:50.495
I saw you snatch that phone.

09:50.497 --> 09:53.565
I already got busted,
so it don't matter.

09:53.567 --> 09:55.033
You need a phone?

09:58.772 --> 10:01.039
Don't worry about it.

10:10.751 --> 10:13.385
How come you never say
anything during group?

10:15.522 --> 10:19.391
Whole time I've been coming,
you never once said anything.

10:19.393 --> 10:21.326
It's stupid, huh?

10:21.328 --> 10:23.128
It's not stupid.

10:23.130 --> 10:24.429
Just don't have nothing to say.

10:24.431 --> 10:25.931
Nothing?

10:29.369 --> 10:32.437
Why are you in here?

10:32.439 --> 10:33.738
Used to be messed up.

10:33.740 --> 10:35.207
Used to be?

10:35.209 --> 10:37.175
Man, I'm better than most
of these fools talking about,

10:37.177 --> 10:39.611
"Oh, I'm so messed up now
'cause my daddy touched me."

10:39.613 --> 10:42.380
You better shut up.

10:42.382 --> 10:44.649
For real... They're tired.

10:44.651 --> 10:46.084
So, you got your diddle played with.

10:46.086 --> 10:47.552
Deal with it.

10:47.554 --> 10:49.754
That's messed up.

10:55.996 --> 10:57.496
Let me see.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.067
Come on.

11:14.114 --> 11:16.047
Want to go take some pictures?

11:16.049 --> 11:20.152
Just go somewhere, take some pictures?

11:22.523 --> 11:24.356
No.

11:28.225 --> 11:30.795
JD came to Jeanette.

11:30.797 --> 11:33.064
Uh, he... He was upset because...

11:33.066 --> 11:36.957
Because we all... we all
need to be mindful about

11:36.960 --> 11:38.904
what's happening, how...
how it's happening,

11:38.906 --> 11:42.140
and JD said that he was turned
away from seeing your father.

11:42.142 --> 11:44.910
There had been a
misunderstanding at the hospital.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.244
He said you turned him away.

11:46.246 --> 11:48.180
Well, like Carson says, there was a...

11:48.182 --> 11:49.814
There was a misunderstanding.

11:49.816 --> 11:52.417
Oh. I'm sure it was a misunderstanding.

11:52.419 --> 11:55.954
But JD was upset.

11:55.956 --> 11:59.858
And you... you feel like
you know this because...

11:59.860 --> 12:02.761
Well, I sat with JD, and I talked to...

12:02.763 --> 12:07.265
I listened to him, and
the... the hurt was there.

12:07.267 --> 12:09.534
It wasn't something
anybody needs to guess at.

12:09.536 --> 12:12.938
He came to me, he broke down,
and it was very clear why.

12:12.940 --> 12:16.975
Maybe... maybe...

12:16.977 --> 12:20.879
You don't want any hurt,
but that doesn't mean

12:20.881 --> 12:23.982
- you didn't hurt somebody.
- Did... Did he... Did... Did he tell you...

12:23.984 --> 12:26.885
Did JD tell you that he showed
up at the... the hospital

12:26.887 --> 12:28.320
with liquor on his breath?

12:31.124 --> 12:33.425
I know he has problems.

12:33.427 --> 12:35.193
He's a drunk.

12:35.195 --> 12:38.263
And that's just a plain fact.

12:38.265 --> 12:39.898
Do you think that we want that

12:39.900 --> 12:42.801
around our father in his last days?

12:42.803 --> 12:45.604
Well, he just wants to see your dad.

12:45.606 --> 12:49.507
Well, then JD can clean himself up.

12:49.509 --> 12:52.277
And I-I don't understand why you feel

12:52.279 --> 12:54.913
that you have the right to
tell us about our family.

12:56.316 --> 12:57.983
This is my family, too.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.252
Well, you have a family,

13:00.254 --> 13:02.020
and your family needs help.

13:02.022 --> 13:04.122
And we didn't tell you what to do

13:04.124 --> 13:05.757
when your sister was addicted,

13:05.759 --> 13:08.226
except to get her
away from our business,

13:08.228 --> 13:11.062
which she was stealing from.

13:11.064 --> 13:14.132
The same way you took from this family.

13:14.134 --> 13:15.767
What does that mean?

13:15.769 --> 13:18.370
What are you talking about?
What is she talking about?

13:18.372 --> 13:22.607
The check that you wrote
to the workers' group.

13:22.609 --> 13:24.409
They're attacking us,

13:24.411 --> 13:26.344
and you used the family's money...

13:26.346 --> 13:27.764
That was my money.

13:27.767 --> 13:30.915
...the family's money to pay them off.

13:30.917 --> 13:34.352
Can you imagine how that makes us look?

13:34.354 --> 13:37.756
And what kind of...
Of frivolous litigation

13:37.758 --> 13:39.524
it could have opened us to if...

13:39.526 --> 13:42.127
If Carson hadn't put
a stop on the check?

13:43.930 --> 13:47.332
Now, I understand with your situation

13:47.334 --> 13:50.568
if you're more
sympathetic to an alcoholic

13:50.570 --> 13:52.837
than to an old man on his deathbed.

13:52.839 --> 13:56.241
I really... I do... I get that.

13:56.243 --> 13:58.677
But why don't you try to understand

13:58.679 --> 14:01.646
what this family's going through?

14:07.888 --> 14:09.521
Thank you.

14:09.523 --> 14:11.956
Thank you for, um, you
know... For hearing us out.

14:11.958 --> 14:13.458
Of course.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.363
You know, I, um...

14:18.365 --> 14:20.332
While I'm thinking about it, I, uh...

14:20.334 --> 14:23.268
I saw Wick Sommers the
other day. You remember Wick?

14:23.270 --> 14:26.071
Why didn't you tell me you
put a stop on that check?

14:26.073 --> 14:28.039
Giving money to those people
was not the right thing to do.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.507
Well, why didn't you tell me?

14:29.509 --> 14:31.643
Because you did something
that made you feel good,

14:31.645 --> 14:32.644
- and I thought that...
- "Feel good"?

14:32.646 --> 14:34.446
...i-if I just didn't tell you,

14:34.448 --> 14:35.580
maybe you'd get out of
whatever mood you're in.

14:35.582 --> 14:37.082
You think I'm just trying
to make myself feel good?

14:37.084 --> 14:39.684
You know, I don't know.
I-I don't... I don't...

14:39.686 --> 14:41.186
How do you think I feel right now?

14:41.188 --> 14:43.788
How do you think you're making me feel?

Passport and forms, please?

17:39.642 --> 17:42.076
Kiosk line first, then CBP line.

17:42.079 --> 17:43.211
No English.

Gabrielle! Gabrielle!

18:08.452 --> 18:09.919
Oh!

18:09.921 --> 18:11.387
Bonjour.

18:11.389 --> 18:12.354
Bonjour.

18:12.356 --> 18:14.023
This is Nicky.

18:14.025 --> 18:15.191
Bonjour, bonjour.

18:15.193 --> 18:16.292
Bonjour !

18:16.294 --> 18:18.727
Bonjour, Nicky. Ça va ?

18:18.729 --> 18:19.895
Hi.

18:19.897 --> 18:21.197
Bonjour.

18:21.199 --> 18:22.164
Bonjour.

18:22.166 --> 18:23.465
Your first French word.

18:23.467 --> 18:24.767
Here, let's go. D'accord.

18:26.137 --> 18:27.811
They don't make it easy.

18:27.814 --> 18:30.141
Ils ne redent pas les choses faciles.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.876
Oh. Hmm?

18:31.878 --> 18:34.913
Non. Même quand nous voyageons,
dès qu'on arrive à la...

18:34.915 --> 18:36.548
uh, the... the border?

18:36.550 --> 18:38.516
Um...

18:38.518 --> 18:42.120
Dès qu'on arrive à la
frontièr, tout est...

18:42.122 --> 18:45.190
Uh, They just... They
just don't make it easy.

18:45.192 --> 18:47.325
Mon français est très mauvais.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.294
No. No, no, no. Il est très bon.

18:50.931 --> 18:52.564
Merci.

18:52.566 --> 18:56.501
Ça c'est encore une
chose qui n'est pas...

18:56.503 --> 18:58.470
Um...

18:58.472 --> 19:00.405
That's the other thing
they don't make easy.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.374
Workers' visas?

19:02.376 --> 19:04.142
Hmm?

19:04.144 --> 19:06.778
Uh... Mais nous sommes...

19:06.780 --> 19:11.182
Mais nous sommes tellement
ravis que vous soyez là.

19:11.184 --> 19:14.452
Uh, we... We're just so
happy that you're here

19:14.454 --> 19:16.554
to... to, uh, help take care of Nicky.

19:16.556 --> 19:19.157
Merci beaucoup, Madame Coates.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.825
Oh, no, "Madame Coates"...

19:20.827 --> 19:24.229
C'est un peu trop formel,
non ? Appelez-moi Clair.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.197
Merci, Clair, merci.

19:29.403 --> 19:32.337
Voilà votre chambre.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.471
Pour moi ?

19:33.473 --> 19:35.273
Rien que pour vous.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.376
Toute seule.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.479
Reposez-vous. D'accord.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.114
Plus tard nous irons ensemble.

19:43.116 --> 19:45.550
Je vous montrerai le
parc ou Nicky aime jouer.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.851
D'accord.

19:46.853 --> 19:50.789
Nous sommes heureux que vous soyez là.

19:50.791 --> 19:52.724
Merci.

19:52.726 --> 19:54.125
- Merci.
- Mm.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.840
Just right along here is good.

20:11.445 --> 20:13.411
All right.

20:16.205 --> 20:18.583
All right. Let's get all that stuff off.

20:18.585 --> 20:21.653
- How they do.
- How's it going, Nicholas?

20:21.655 --> 20:22.787
Good to see you again, my friend.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.289
- Good to see you.
- Hi, Guy.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.934
- Good to see you, as always.
- You want something?

20:25.936 --> 20:27.403
No, I'm good. Thank you, sir.

20:36.770 --> 20:39.037
You use Kiln-dried?

20:39.039 --> 20:41.473
Plywood... Grade "A."

20:41.475 --> 20:43.741
Well, half the stuff I
couldn't sell if I wanted to.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.276
Not to my customers.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.178
I'm seeing stitching all along the back.

20:47.180 --> 20:49.280
Your manufacturer didn't
even try to hide it.

20:49.282 --> 20:52.183
And the seams aren't
uniform. Now plywood, too?

20:52.185 --> 20:53.985
And I'm seeing visible press marks.

20:53.987 --> 20:55.787
- That's just on the samples.
- I want you on a plane.

20:55.789 --> 20:57.589
I want you sitting down
with the manufacturer.

20:57.591 --> 20:58.890
We can look for another factory.

20:58.892 --> 21:00.358
Another factory that's cheaper?

21:00.360 --> 21:02.327
'Cause that... That's cheap.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.929
You want to do cheaper?

21:04.931 --> 21:07.365
We're... We're... We're
supposed to be saving money,

21:07.367 --> 21:10.802
but now we're... We're
losing clients and...

21:10.804 --> 21:16.374
I mean, we... We've been with
him for what? 20, 22 years.

21:16.376 --> 21:19.544
And he just walked on us?

21:22.649 --> 21:25.150
It's a hard market right now.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.590
We need to look at
cutting back on staff.

21:32.592 --> 21:35.527
Cut back on more staff.

21:47.207 --> 21:49.040
Un cochon.

21:49.042 --> 21:52.143
Un cochon.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.112
Oh, une voiture.

21:54.114 --> 21:55.113
Une voiture.

21:55.115 --> 21:57.749
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom!

21:57.751 --> 21:59.217
Un chat.

21:59.219 --> 22:02.020
Un chat.

22:02.022 --> 22:03.655
Nicholas? Is that you?

22:03.657 --> 22:05.456
Un cobaye.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.458
Un cobaye.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.294
Un camion.

22:09.296 --> 22:11.763
Un camion.

22:11.765 --> 22:13.765
Un cheval.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.267
Un cheval.

22:16.269 --> 22:18.603
- Comme à cheval.
- Gabrielle?

22:18.605 --> 22:20.605
Voici mon mari, Nicholas.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.106
Bonsoir, Monsieur Coates.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.320
Merci.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.739
_

22:51.286 --> 22:53.413
_

23:25.898 --> 23:29.266
Do you have any contact with
a parent or a legal guardian?

23:29.268 --> 23:31.201
No.

23:31.203 --> 23:34.304
Do you know the whereabouts
of your parents or a guardian?

23:37.009 --> 23:40.410
I don't know where my dad is.

23:40.412 --> 23:42.813
I know where my mom is.

23:42.815 --> 23:44.781
Do you have the means to contact her?

23:46.352 --> 23:47.951
Do... Do I...

23:47.953 --> 23:51.889
Either in person or by post
or electronic communication?

23:53.392 --> 23:57.094
I-I know where she is, but...

23:57.096 --> 24:00.831
Prior to requesting this
waiver to have an abortion,

24:00.833 --> 24:02.730
have you made an attempt to contact her?

24:02.733 --> 24:03.934
No.

24:06.639 --> 24:08.405
Are you aware of any medical reason

24:08.407 --> 24:10.841
that you would require a
termination of your pregnancy

24:10.843 --> 24:13.911
within the next 24 hours?

24:13.913 --> 24:15.712
No.

24:18.417 --> 24:21.318
Then it is my directive
that you first attempt

24:21.320 --> 24:23.495
to secure permission from your parent.

24:23.498 --> 24:25.431
If after no response is received,

24:25.433 --> 24:27.901
the court can again
take up your request.

24:27.903 --> 24:29.636
I want an abortion.

24:29.638 --> 24:32.705
I understand, and I'm leaving
open the possibility...

24:32.707 --> 24:35.642
- You're telling me to go away.
- ...to take the necessary steps.

24:35.644 --> 24:36.943
Why am I here?

24:36.945 --> 24:39.546
The law requires that
un-emancipated minors

24:39.548 --> 24:42.482
receive a legal waiver.

24:42.484 --> 24:45.733
I'm supposed to be
testifying against my pimp.

24:45.736 --> 24:48.488
You all want me to do something
to stop people like him.

24:48.490 --> 24:50.256
So how come when I decide
how to take care of myself

24:50.258 --> 24:52.192
I'm the one in court?

24:52.194 --> 24:54.961
Not wanting a child isn't
sufficient reason for a waiver.

24:54.963 --> 24:56.596
- What's a good reason?
- Shae...

24:56.598 --> 24:59.365
What's a good reason?

24:59.367 --> 25:02.435
Inability to contact a parent,

25:02.437 --> 25:06.372
if contacting that parent could
potentially put you in jeopardy.

25:09.377 --> 25:12.178
I screwed guys in alleys.

25:14.549 --> 25:16.182
I screwed guys in alleys

25:16.184 --> 25:18.484
'cause that was better
than what I came from.

25:20.388 --> 25:23.131
I don't know if I'd be in danger.

25:23.134 --> 25:25.758
But I shouldn't have to ask
the person who made me want to

25:25.760 --> 25:28.561
screw guys in alleys if
I can have an abortion.

25:42.177 --> 25:44.143
The judge will grant the abortion

25:44.145 --> 25:46.246
if you're under 20 weeks.

25:46.248 --> 25:48.848
You're required to get
an ultrasound first.

25:48.850 --> 25:49.849
Why?

25:53.321 --> 25:56.789
Because you're required to.

26:42.804 --> 26:45.171
iAuxilio! iAuxilio!

26:59.921 --> 27:02.388
Walked right into the harvester.

27:02.390 --> 27:03.856
Stupid.

27:03.858 --> 27:06.459
He should be torn up.

27:06.461 --> 27:09.228
All that... that's that's nothing.

27:09.230 --> 27:10.263
Lucky.

27:13.368 --> 27:15.802
Your vitals are good.

27:15.804 --> 27:17.804
Just take it easy the rest of the day.

27:20.275 --> 27:23.543
Take these as needed.

27:23.545 --> 27:25.845
No, I don't... I don't want them.

27:25.847 --> 27:27.513
Tell him he's good.

27:29.451 --> 27:31.084
You're good.

27:31.086 --> 27:33.086
How much for seeing him
and everything today?

27:33.088 --> 27:34.020
$35.

27:34.022 --> 27:37.190
$35. Yeah, he can afford that.

27:37.192 --> 27:39.425
And how much for the meds?

27:39.427 --> 27:41.094
$10.

27:41.096 --> 27:44.831
Give him some more, just in case.

28:02.784 --> 28:04.584
You can hang here the rest of the day.

28:04.586 --> 28:07.587
You'll... be good.

28:07.589 --> 28:11.024
Take the pills.

28:11.026 --> 28:12.525
Please.

28:16.931 --> 28:18.264
Please.

28:18.266 --> 28:22.435
You weren't doing nothing
but wandering the streets.

28:22.437 --> 28:24.804
A druggie out wandering.

28:26.374 --> 28:28.541
I gave you a job.

28:28.543 --> 28:30.209
I gave you a chance to get right.

28:30.211 --> 28:32.045
Take the pills.

28:32.047 --> 28:34.147
You remember when you
first laughed at me

28:34.149 --> 28:36.182
when I told you about picking tomatoes?

28:50.501 --> 28:52.902
This is nice.

28:52.904 --> 28:55.170
This is really nice.

28:55.172 --> 28:58.407
I want to do this more.

28:58.409 --> 28:59.875
Do...?

28:59.877 --> 29:02.378
Spend time together.

29:02.380 --> 29:04.780
Hmm.

29:10.931 --> 29:13.165
What?

29:13.167 --> 29:15.600
She only speaks French.

29:15.602 --> 29:17.702
No, I think she speaks
a little bit of Spanish.

29:17.704 --> 29:19.805
I-I-I don't see the point
of getting a nanny from Haiti

29:19.807 --> 29:21.106
who doesn't speak English.

29:21.108 --> 29:22.407
Well, Nicky wants to teach her English.

29:22.409 --> 29:25.310
I mean, you've got a friend
who gets a nanny from Ghana,

29:25.312 --> 29:27.245
- you know, so you need to...
- She's gonna teach Nicky French.

29:27.247 --> 29:30.482
No one speaks French.

29:30.484 --> 29:32.117
Everybody in France speaks French.

29:32.119 --> 29:35.921
N-No, e-everybody in
France is... is in France,

29:35.923 --> 29:38.089
- so they don't...
- I speak French.

29:38.091 --> 29:40.058
Hmm.

29:47.777 --> 29:49.744
Want another drink?

29:49.746 --> 29:51.345
Ah, let's just get the check.

29:51.347 --> 29:53.648
Oh, come on.

29:53.650 --> 29:55.616
It's still early. Come on.

29:59.355 --> 30:02.890
Do you remember when
we used to get so drunk,

30:02.892 --> 30:04.525
we'd have those three-hour dinners,

30:04.527 --> 30:06.127
we'd have to get a room.

30:06.129 --> 30:07.428
Mm-hmm.

30:07.430 --> 30:08.563
Okay?

30:08.565 --> 30:10.031
Yeah, well, we got a kid now.

30:10.033 --> 30:11.505
- I mean, we can't just...
- I know.

30:11.508 --> 30:12.967
...run off, do whatever we...

30:12.969 --> 30:15.736
Well, that's why I wanted
to get help around the house.

30:15.738 --> 30:19.807
With Gabrielle, we can
do those things again.

30:24.848 --> 30:26.948
Do you... Do you remember the first time

30:26.950 --> 30:28.583
we did get drunk and got a room?

30:28.585 --> 30:30.551
Oh, um...

30:30.553 --> 30:32.820
No, I mean do you... Do
you remember the first time?

30:32.822 --> 30:35.289
I don't know. It's been a while.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.091
Well, that was our first furniture order

30:37.093 --> 30:38.726
that totaled $10,000.

30:38.728 --> 30:40.661
It was for the Sandersons.

30:40.663 --> 30:43.097
It was a... It was a dining room set,

30:43.099 --> 30:45.700
and I designed each piece
just the way he described them.

30:45.702 --> 30:47.335
And you, you brought the deal

30:47.338 --> 30:49.137
- in on the number.
- Oh, my gosh.

30:49.139 --> 30:50.138
I cannot believe you remember this.

30:50.140 --> 30:51.606
Oh, yeah. I mean, right on the number.

30:51.608 --> 30:54.208
And, uh, at $10,000.

30:54.210 --> 30:56.177
And we went to the Marriott, right?

30:56.179 --> 30:57.612
And we were just gonna, you know,

30:57.614 --> 31:00.414
get a few drinks in the
bar and then go home.

31:00.416 --> 31:02.892
But we didn't.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.785
I can't believe you remember that.

31:04.787 --> 31:07.221
Ah, I remember things.

31:07.222 --> 31:09.489
I mean, I... I remember things, Clair.

31:12.395 --> 31:15.696
Ah, I don't remember the details,

31:15.698 --> 31:19.567
but... but, uh, I do know
we need to do this more.

31:19.569 --> 31:22.803
Let's get, uh, the check.
I got to work tomorrow.

31:22.805 --> 31:24.939
Let's get the check.

31:24.941 --> 31:26.574
Okay.

31:29.078 --> 31:31.078
Okay.

31:44.961 --> 31:46.928
Okay.

31:46.930 --> 31:49.363
You look to be about 14 weeks.

31:49.365 --> 31:52.133
Look at that.

31:52.135 --> 31:54.802
He or she's just bouncing away in there.

31:54.804 --> 31:58.206
I could print you a picture.

31:58.208 --> 32:01.609
You interested in hearing the heartbeat?

32:01.611 --> 32:04.212
I know what you're trying to do.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.347
It's not required.

32:06.349 --> 32:09.450
The more boxes we tick, the better.

32:09.452 --> 32:11.419
Okay.

32:59.435 --> 33:01.202
Uh, tout va bien, madame ?

33:01.204 --> 33:03.371
Retournez vous coucher.

33:32.035 --> 33:34.869
I need you to text Isaac.

33:34.871 --> 33:36.804
Tell him to come here.

33:36.806 --> 33:39.140
What?

33:39.142 --> 33:41.275
Why?

33:46.983 --> 33:49.150
Do you have family?

33:53.389 --> 33:55.690
No.

33:55.692 --> 33:58.693
No, I ain't got no family.

34:02.065 --> 34:05.333
Text Isaac.

34:05.335 --> 34:07.168
Text him.

34:48.244 --> 34:50.244
Nothing's keeping you here.

34:50.246 --> 34:52.112
Go!

34:54.317 --> 34:56.183
Go.

36:04.203 --> 36:06.372

36:07.498 --> 36:09.792

36:12.636 --> 36:15.036
Tell me about Teo.

36:26.734 --> 36:28.650
Teo?

36:28.653 --> 36:33.856
A boy. A girl, he helped her.

36:33.857 --> 36:35.557
You killed him.

36:59.249 --> 37:02.650
W-Wait, no. No, no.

37:02.652 --> 37:04.085
Wait, w-wait!

37:04.087 --> 37:07.288
Tell me about my son.

37:14.898 --> 37:17.098
Tell me about my son.

37:17.100 --> 37:21.069
Your... Y-Your son?

37:21.071 --> 37:24.607
Him... the girl?

37:28.078 --> 37:33.248
I... I... I didn't do nothing.

37:40.390 --> 37:43.024
Your son...

37:46.563 --> 37:48.363
He, uh...

37:48.365 --> 37:50.331
He did it to himself.

37:57.021 --> 37:58.520
Teo!

39:24.494 --> 39:26.461
Hey.

39:26.463 --> 39:29.097
Are you with us?

39:29.099 --> 39:32.867
You with us?

39:32.869 --> 39:35.637
We're gonna get you
to the hospital, okay?

39:42.712 --> 39:45.547
You got anybody we need
to get in touch with?

39:49.085 --> 39:52.020
My family.

39:52.022 --> 39:53.969
Can I call my family?

40:07.321 --> 40:09.615

40:19.458 --> 40:21.752

40:31.470 --> 40:33.139
