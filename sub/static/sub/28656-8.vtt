ELEMENTARY #708
"Miss Understood"
Closed Captioned

00:00.434 --> 00:02.903
Previously on Elementary...
Mina Davenport.

00:02.903 --> 00:04.338
Are you familiar
with the case?
Of course.

00:04.338 --> 00:05.806
She was kidnapped
in 2004.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.941
Ten years later she
escaped and came home.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.443
HOLMES:
Mina.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.178
Is everything okay?

00:11.178 --> 00:12.446
WATSON:
Basically, this girl
could not have grown up

00:12.446 --> 00:13.981
to become this girl.

00:13.981 --> 00:16.250
You are one of the best
liars I have ever met,

00:16.250 --> 00:18.151
and that's
saying something.

00:18.151 --> 00:21.655
My real name is Cassie, but you
can call me Mina if it's easier.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.590
You think I killed
that FBI agent.

00:23.590 --> 00:25.826
Think you can lie your way out?

00:25.826 --> 00:26.927
I do.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.295
Now tell me...

00:28.295 --> 00:29.529
am I lying?

00:33.534 --> 00:35.769
Mr. Weller, appreciate
you coming back in.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.337
This makes what,
three times?

00:37.337 --> 00:38.772
Frankly, these interviews

00:38.772 --> 00:40.774
are starting
to feel like harassment.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.543
I already admitted
to what happened

00:42.543 --> 00:43.777
between me and Summer.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.345
It was a one-time thing.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.381
Right. Ms. Voss was
your physical therapist,

00:47.381 --> 00:49.716
things got physical.
But, you know--

00:49.716 --> 00:51.518
homicide investigation--
we like to be thorough.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.520
Where is it even a homicide?

00:53.520 --> 00:55.389
She died in a car accident.
And I was

00:55.389 --> 00:57.391
in front of a class full
of students when it happened.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.859
Like I said on the
phone, we just have

00:58.859 --> 01:00.093
one more thing to go over.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.399
Fear not, Mr. Weller.
Unlike the yoga ball

01:05.399 --> 01:06.800
you used
to kill Summer Voss,

01:06.800 --> 01:08.735
this one won't hurt anyone.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.638
Got to hand it to you.

01:11.638 --> 01:14.474
At first we couldn't
figure out how you did it.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.910
We only knew you had motive
after her friends told us

01:16.910 --> 01:19.212
she'd threatened to expose
your bedswerving to your wife.

01:19.212 --> 01:21.014
Then we
noticed

01:21.014 --> 01:23.317
a small incision
in the deflated yoga ball

01:23.317 --> 01:25.185
police found in Summer's car.

01:25.185 --> 01:26.853
Their lab
tested the ball

01:26.853 --> 01:29.022
and found traces
of carbon monoxide inside.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.024
You knew what time
Summer went to work.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.392
And you knew
what kind of yoga ball

01:32.392 --> 01:34.661
she kept in her car,
so you bought an identical one

01:34.661 --> 01:36.263
and filled it
with carbon monoxide.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.664
You have access
to the gas

01:37.664 --> 01:38.999
through your school's

01:38.999 --> 01:40.934
chemistry lab.
You created
a slow leak

01:40.934 --> 01:42.202
and then you swapped
your ball in right before

01:42.202 --> 01:43.670
Summer got in her car.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.238
The gas filled the
cabin as she drove,

01:45.238 --> 01:47.274
and she asphyxiated
behind the wheel.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.575
BELL:
We showed your photo
to the cashier

01:48.575 --> 01:51.211
at a sporting goods store
near your school.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.413
He ID'd you, and he
confirmed that you bought

01:53.413 --> 01:54.948
a ball just
like that one.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.085
You're lucky the crash
didn't kill anyone else.

01:58.085 --> 02:01.521
This way, you're only looking
at one life sentence.

02:01.521 --> 02:03.290
(phone dings)

02:03.290 --> 02:06.059
It's our new client
from London, Nathan Garrideb.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.061
He's landed, wants to know
if he can swing by

02:08.061 --> 02:09.363
straight from the airport.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.864
Tell him no.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.133
In fact, tell him all three
Garridebs have to wait.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.435
Something more
pressing has come up.

02:15.435 --> 02:16.670
Is that...

02:17.871 --> 02:20.540
The impostor formerly known
as Mina Davenport.

02:20.540 --> 02:21.875
Hello.

02:23.577 --> 02:24.745
Been a long time.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.146
Not long enough.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.781
I'll give you credit.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.116
You told me you'd beat
the charges

02:29.116 --> 02:31.084
for murdering Agent
Underhill, and you did.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.086
Because I didn't do it.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.822
You know that now, right?

02:35.822 --> 02:37.624
We know about the facts.

02:37.624 --> 02:39.893
A gang of meth dealers
was operating

02:39.893 --> 02:41.461
near the clearing where
Underhill was found.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.930
One of them confessed to
killing him. He said that a man

02:43.930 --> 02:45.132
with an FBI badge wandered

02:45.132 --> 02:47.401
into their turf, so they did
what they had to do.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.902
So, yes.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.104
We accept that you didn't
kill him with your own hands.

02:51.104 --> 02:53.140
But what--

02:53.140 --> 02:56.009
You think I sent him there
hoping they'd kill him

02:56.009 --> 02:58.245
because I thought
he was onto me?

02:58.245 --> 03:00.247
You were impersonating
Mina Davenport

03:00.247 --> 03:01.782
to get access
to her trust fund.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.583
Underhill was
reinvestigating

03:03.583 --> 03:04.985
your case.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.254
And I pled guilty
to fraud for what I did

03:07.254 --> 03:08.522
and served my time.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.193
(sighs)
Look.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.629
I've been sitting
out here a long time.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.597
Can I come in
and I'll explain why I'm here?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.475
So, Cassie Lenue

03:28.475 --> 03:30.477
is the name you're going
by these days, is it?

03:31.611 --> 03:33.680
Cassie is my real name.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.949
At least, as far
as I can remember.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.818
Lenue is just something
the court assigned.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.287
LNU.

03:40.287 --> 03:43.123
Means "last name unknown." It's
the court's version of John Doe.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.357
Sometimes they
pronounce it

03:44.357 --> 03:46.893
phonetically
and sometimes it sticks.

03:46.893 --> 03:47.961
You maintained
throughout the proceedings

03:47.961 --> 03:49.129
you don't know your real name.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.498
It's the truth. I was...

03:51.498 --> 03:53.900
in and out of foster homes
my whole life.

03:55.502 --> 03:56.736
Somewhere it got lost.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.305
Obviously,

03:58.305 --> 03:59.806
I can't convince you.

03:59.806 --> 04:03.009
Nope, you can't.
So state your business.

04:03.009 --> 04:05.011
Did the halfway house you were
staying at throw you out

04:05.011 --> 04:07.414
because the other ex-cons
find you too untrustworthy?

04:07.414 --> 04:09.683
No, it's nothing like that.

04:12.552 --> 04:15.422
Someone I care about
was murdered.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.125
I want to hire you to solve it.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.770
"Passaic Woman's Murder
Remains Unsolved."

05:03.770 --> 05:06.640
Says the victim's name
was Heather Foley.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.276
She was shot in a parking lot
three weeks ago

05:09.276 --> 05:12.746
at a kids clothing store.
No witnesses.

05:12.746 --> 05:16.249
Her husband is asking
the public for leads.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.251
It says she was a foster mom.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.255
She was my foster mom.

05:23.590 --> 05:26.326
For a while,
when I was around 14.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.495
Here.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.463
Perhaps if
your mouth is busy,

05:30.463 --> 05:31.665
you won't lie as much.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.667
Why do you have to be so mean?

05:33.667 --> 05:34.968
Because I don't think
you've said

05:34.968 --> 05:36.336
an honest word since "Hello."

05:36.336 --> 05:38.638
WATSON: We've read
all your court records.

05:38.638 --> 05:39.906
You claimed that you
shared everything

05:39.906 --> 05:41.341
you knew about your past.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.610
Every orphanage, every foster
home you could remember.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.645
You never mentioned
this woman once. Why not?

05:45.645 --> 05:48.181
Because I didn't
want Heather to know

05:48.181 --> 05:49.549
about the trouble I was in.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.485
I was ashamed.

05:52.485 --> 05:53.987
We've seen ample evidence

05:53.987 --> 05:55.855
that you're not capable
of shame.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.191
WATSON:
When we check New Jersey's

05:58.191 --> 06:00.193
foster records, will we find
a record of this placement?

06:00.193 --> 06:03.763
No, it...
it wasn't official.

06:03.763 --> 06:05.599
I had run away
from the place

06:05.599 --> 06:07.167
where I was living.
I met Heather

06:07.167 --> 06:09.202
on a food line,
and she took me in.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.838
After a few months,

06:11.838 --> 06:13.106
I was in trouble again,

06:13.106 --> 06:14.241
so I moved on.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.177
It's convenient--

06:17.177 --> 06:20.113
another
un-confirmable story.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.248
As is your wont.

06:22.782 --> 06:25.185
It wasn't easy for me
to come to you.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.120
I know how you
feel about me,

06:27.120 --> 06:31.024
but... Heather was
one of the only people

06:31.024 --> 06:34.527
in my whole life
who ever cared about me.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.263
And you're the best
at what you do.

06:40.834 --> 06:44.037
She was buying clothes
for her foster kids

06:44.037 --> 06:45.705
when she got gunned down.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.842
Whether you believe
anything I say or not...

06:48.842 --> 06:51.778
doesn't this sound like
someone who deserves justice?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.152
Hey, you got
the article I sent you?

06:59.152 --> 07:01.721
I did, but first we're
gonna talk about Mina

07:01.721 --> 07:03.356
or Cassie or
whatever her name is

07:03.356 --> 07:04.858
just showing up at your house.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.559
I assume you guys hid
all the silverware?

07:06.559 --> 07:08.361
And the checkbooks.

07:08.361 --> 07:11.164
You said she knew the woman
in the article, Heather Foley?

07:11.164 --> 07:13.266
I said she says she knows her.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.501
You think it's a trick.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.169
I think it's impossible
to know with her.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.104
Right now, we're just playing
along. We thought we'd look

07:18.104 --> 07:19.506
look into the murder
of Heather Foley.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.840
Try and figure out
what she's up to.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.342
I left a message
for the detective

07:22.342 --> 07:23.777
in Passaic who's
working the case.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.845
I'll let you know
when I hear back.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.113
Meantime, I dug
up what I could.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.215
Far as the murder
itself goes,

07:29.215 --> 07:31.217
everything in the
article is right.

07:31.217 --> 07:32.752
Single gunshot
wound to the head,

07:32.752 --> 07:34.921
nine millimeter slug,
ballistics didn't find a match.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.222
No other leads.

07:36.222 --> 07:37.857
Reads to me like the cops

07:37.857 --> 07:39.292
looked at the husband,
but ruled him out.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.562
Cassie did 20 months
at Taconic, right?

07:42.562 --> 07:43.963
Yeah.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.865
I know I don't need
to tell you this,

07:45.865 --> 07:47.534
but watch your backs.
Prison's a good place

07:47.534 --> 07:49.536
for someone like her
to learn new tricks.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.638
I promise, we're not gonna
let her out of our sight.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.841
In fact, Sherlock is with her
right now, getting her situated.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.546
Right, for the extent
of the investigation,

07:59.546 --> 08:01.214
you'll be living
under our roof.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.416
We'll know where you are and
what you're doing at all times.

08:03.416 --> 08:06.252
You're going to keep this
with you at all times.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.288
It's enabled to send
and receive calls

08:08.288 --> 08:09.656
only with Watson and myself.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.891
You'll possess no other
electronic devices.

08:11.891 --> 08:14.427
You'll keep it powered on...
So you can track
my location with it.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.296
Problem?
No.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.565
The fact that you've
brought us this case

08:18.565 --> 08:19.899
tells me you're
up to something.

08:19.899 --> 08:21.101
You may have accomplices.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.469
You may intend
someone harm.

08:22.469 --> 08:23.937
So until I know
what your game is,

08:23.937 --> 08:25.905
you can abandon
all expectation of privacy.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.440
You've spent time in prison.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.276
So it should be easy.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.544
Fair enough.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.748
And thanks.

08:34.748 --> 08:37.484
I appreciate
you doing this.

08:37.484 --> 08:38.952
What?

08:38.952 --> 08:41.154
I will find out
what you're up to.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.690
You mean,
besides trying to find out

08:43.690 --> 08:45.525
who killed the person
I cared about?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.794
Yeah, besides that.
Now, do whatever settling in

08:47.794 --> 08:49.028
you need to do quickly.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.464
Watson is tending to a client
who's in from abroad.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.533
You and I will visit
Heather Foley's husband.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.157
Hey.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.358
You came back.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.360
I told you I would.
(chuckles)

09:20.360 --> 09:21.628
And you brought help.

09:21.628 --> 09:23.963
Judd Foley,
Sherlock Holmes.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.632
My condolences on your loss.

09:25.632 --> 09:28.234
Cassie said she had a friend
who was a detective.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.870
I hope she explained
I can't afford to pay much.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.205
I told him I'd bet

09:32.205 --> 09:33.540
you'd take the
case for free.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.341
Oh, well, free it is, then.

09:35.341 --> 09:38.077
Wouldn't want to make
a liar out of Cassie.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.846
Please, come in.

09:49.889 --> 09:53.493
Remind me, how long did
Cassie live here with you?

09:53.493 --> 09:56.196
Judd and Heather
weren't together back then.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.530
I just lived with Heather.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.899
We were, uh, married
for four years.

09:59.899 --> 10:03.503
So when did you meet?
Just last week.

10:03.503 --> 10:06.172
But I feel like
I've known her for forever.

10:06.172 --> 10:07.540
(Holmes chuckles)

10:07.540 --> 10:09.776
I read about what
happened online

10:09.776 --> 10:11.845
and I came to
pay my respects.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.880
I was amazed...

10:13.880 --> 10:15.381
how much Cassie remembered.

10:15.381 --> 10:18.551
She brought Stargazer lilies,
Heather's favorite flower.

10:18.551 --> 10:22.856
She remembered how much Heather
loved Destiny's Child.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.724
How she'd listen to them
while she exercised.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.727
And then eat Yodels and complain
that she undid all that work.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.262
(laughs)

10:29.262 --> 10:31.564
It must be a great comfort...

10:31.564 --> 10:33.733
meeting someone
Heather meant so much to.

10:33.733 --> 10:37.537
Heather left her mark on people.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.938
She did a lot of good.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.206
HOLMES: I read
about what happened.

10:40.206 --> 10:43.877
While tragic, it seems to me
that Heather's death

10:43.877 --> 10:47.113
may have been just a mugging,
or a random act of violence.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.448
Given your appeals
to the public,

10:48.448 --> 10:50.116
you obviously think
there's a lot more to it.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.252
So...

10:52.252 --> 10:53.820
what's not in print?

10:55.822 --> 10:58.591
The past few months, Heather
kept getting phone calls

10:58.591 --> 11:00.126
she didn't want me to hear.

11:00.126 --> 11:01.294
Plus, she'd run off

11:01.294 --> 11:03.563
on "errands" at all hours.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.431
You think she was having
an affair?

11:05.431 --> 11:07.834
Did you tell the police?

11:07.834 --> 11:10.603
They said they looked into it
but didn't find anything.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.506
Did you confront Heather
with your suspicions?

11:13.506 --> 11:16.276
She said it was all for work.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.511
What work did she do?

11:18.511 --> 11:21.314
HOLMES:
"Formula-Share."

11:21.314 --> 11:25.018
That's the, uh, company
she worked for.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.353
They buy and sell
baby formula.
Hmm.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.188
Doesn't scream
"late night meetings," does it?

11:29.188 --> 11:31.090
JUDD:
And listen,

11:31.090 --> 11:33.960
if she was cheating on me,
it'll hurt like hell to know,

11:33.960 --> 11:36.429
but I just want whoever did this
to her caught.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.830
CASSIE:
I don't remember this.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.365
I thought Heather worked
for a plant nursery.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.000
She did, back then.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.202
This is something she got into
a couple years ago.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.437
We'd foster infants sometimes,

11:44.437 --> 11:46.706
and sometimes we'd have
extra formula.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.841
So Heather started
selling it online.

11:48.841 --> 11:50.143
Turns out there's
a whole market.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.544
People with extra,

11:51.544 --> 11:53.813
people who can't
afford it in stores.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.481
After a while, she hooked up
with Formula-Share.

11:55.481 --> 11:57.283
Did the police see this?

11:57.283 --> 11:59.219
They copied her whole
hard drive,

11:59.219 --> 12:00.486
so I assume they saw everything.

12:00.486 --> 12:02.722
Why, what is it?

12:02.722 --> 12:05.124
It's an exchange between
Heather and her buyer,

12:05.124 --> 12:06.693
a "Meredith S."

12:06.693 --> 12:10.129
Heather expresses concern about
a potential seller.

12:10.129 --> 12:11.831
Apparently, he had
so much formula to sell

12:11.831 --> 12:13.866
that she had concerns
about the source.

12:13.866 --> 12:17.737
Meredith offers to take the
man's details and look into it.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.405
Concerns about the source? You--

12:19.405 --> 12:22.976
You think Heather got mixed up
with some kind of thief?

12:22.976 --> 12:24.644
I think it's possible.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.480
But if the police saw this,
I'm sure they looked into it.

12:28.881 --> 12:30.350
(door closes)

12:30.350 --> 12:31.985
Those e-mails between
Heather and her buyer,

12:31.985 --> 12:33.853
they meant more to you
than you let on.

12:33.853 --> 12:36.055
What is it you didn't
want Judd to know?

12:36.055 --> 12:37.590
What?

12:37.590 --> 12:40.360
The best liars often make
the best lie detectors.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.594
Thanks?

12:41.594 --> 12:42.595
HOLMES:
Who are those two?

12:42.595 --> 12:44.297
They're cops.
Yep.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.768
The e-mails I saw follow
the classic script.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.704
A middleman tells a buyer
that they know a seller

12:51.704 --> 12:53.239
who can provide
copious product,

12:53.239 --> 12:54.540
but for whatever reason,

12:54.540 --> 12:55.875
the middleman doesn't want
to deal with it.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.410
It's a con.
Yeah.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.746
One used by law enforcement
to introduce a criminal

12:59.746 --> 13:02.682
to an undercover operative.

13:02.682 --> 13:07.020
The buyer, predictably, offers
to deal with the seller direct.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.955
Only the seller's a cop,
and the whole time,

13:08.955 --> 13:11.591
the buyer thinks contacting
the cop was their own idea.

13:11.591 --> 13:14.694
Yeah. Hello.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.929
DEA? FBI?

13:16.929 --> 13:19.966
I'm Detective Owen Calabrissi,
New Jersey State Police.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.201
This is Homicide
Detective Rhea Farrad,

13:22.201 --> 13:23.970
Passaic County
Prosecutor's Office.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.639
I spoke to a colleague
of yours, Marcus Bell?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.408
He caught me up,
said you'd be here.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.609
You're running the investigation

13:29.609 --> 13:31.044
that involved the late
Mrs. Foley?

13:31.044 --> 13:32.545
Got it in one.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.047
CASSIE:
What are you investigating?

13:34.047 --> 13:36.416
Is the baby formula
a cover for drugs?

13:36.416 --> 13:37.717
It's not a cover
for anything.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.920
The formula itself
is the problem. It's hot.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.623
You're saying Formula-Share is
an organized crime ring

13:43.623 --> 13:46.826
dealing in stolen baby formula?
Yeah.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.295
And you had turned Mrs. Foley
into an informant,

13:49.295 --> 13:50.430
trying to get her boss?

13:50.430 --> 13:52.765
But if you're homicide,

13:52.765 --> 13:54.734
and the two of you are
working together...

13:54.734 --> 13:56.335
HOLMES:
They think that

13:56.335 --> 13:58.438
Mrs. Foley's accomplices
found out,

13:58.438 --> 14:00.339
and that's what
got her killed.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.617
Looks more like you're going
after the Five Families

14:11.617 --> 14:14.087
rather than people
stealing baby formula.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.621
CALABRISSI:
Racketeering is racketeering.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.924
Baby formula is expensive,
easy to move.

14:17.924 --> 14:19.459
Gives people a motive
to steal it.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.461
And motive to protect themselves
from getting caught.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.529
CALABRISSI: You weren't far
off when you compared them

14:23.529 --> 14:24.764
to the mob.

14:24.764 --> 14:27.500
Organization is the same,
structured in tiers.

14:27.500 --> 14:32.271
Shoplifters steal the formula
from drugstores, supermarkets.

14:32.271 --> 14:35.808
Lieutenants, like Heather Foley,
funnel it up to the buyers.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.276
The buyers resell it

14:37.276 --> 14:38.945
on the black market

14:38.945 --> 14:40.780
to less-reputable retailers.

14:40.780 --> 14:44.517
Nationally,
a racket like this...

14:44.517 --> 14:46.352
rake in billions a year.

14:46.352 --> 14:49.388
And you're going after them
the same way you would the mob?

14:49.388 --> 14:50.957
Folks at the bottom

14:50.957 --> 14:52.225
are the softest targets.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.726
You arrest them, flip them,

14:53.726 --> 14:56.362
use them to climb
the ladder, and repeat.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.797
So, Sherlock was right.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.499
You had flipped
Heather Foley,

14:59.499 --> 15:01.234
and she was gonna help you
get an undercover cop

15:01.234 --> 15:03.302
in front of her boss.
Ocasio was the undercover.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.238
Heather was setting up a meet

15:05.238 --> 15:08.508
between him and this woman,
Meredith Sagehorn.

15:08.508 --> 15:12.078
The trick is proving that the
boss knows the product's stolen.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.014
The plan was that I'd wear a
wire when I met with Sagehorn.

15:15.014 --> 15:17.550
Make it clear that the formula
I was selling was hot.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.385
Hopefully she'd go
with the buy anyway.

15:19.385 --> 15:21.387
And once you had
Sagehorn on tape

15:21.387 --> 15:22.755
agreeing to buy
stolen goods,

15:22.755 --> 15:24.524
you would've arrested her
and pressured her

15:24.524 --> 15:25.658
to give up the rest
of the group.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.493
Only you think
Sagehorn figured out

15:27.493 --> 15:29.529
Heather had flipped,
so she killed her?

15:29.529 --> 15:31.230
FARRAD:
Or had her killed.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.866
She has an alibi,
but we still like her.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.669
That's why this is a joint op
between New Jersey State Police

15:36.669 --> 15:38.604
and Passaic County Homicide now.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.072
FARRAD: Problem is,
we've hit a wall.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.074
Their undercover op is blown,

15:42.074 --> 15:44.010
so they've got no line
on the formula ring.

15:44.010 --> 15:47.113
And so far, we can't prove
Sagehorn ordered the hit.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.916
I still don't get
NYPD's interest.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.784
Call it a personal connection.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.453
But we don't want to
step on any toes.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.721
FARRAD:
Forget about that.

15:55.721 --> 15:58.324
Any way this closes
is fine with us.

16:05.264 --> 16:06.632
Shouldn't you be in there?

16:06.632 --> 16:09.135
I knew what they were
going to say.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.870
Plus, I can read lips,

16:10.870 --> 16:13.806
so I know the investigation
is well in hand.

16:13.806 --> 16:18.644
I'm out here... focusing
on a mystery more dire.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.382
I like how dangerous
you think I am.

16:23.382 --> 16:25.885
You never explained how
Agent Underhill's blood

16:25.885 --> 16:28.955
got in your car
four years ago.

16:28.955 --> 16:32.959
At the very least, you were
at the scene of his murder,

16:32.959 --> 16:35.261
and you kept it to yourself.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.396
So, is my caution misplaced?

16:37.396 --> 16:39.966
Maybe not.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.969
I performed an experiment last
night after you went to bed.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.504
I tried to get every piece of
information that you claimed

16:45.504 --> 16:48.841
to remember about Heather Foley,
from sources online.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.144
Her social media, photographs
posted, eulogies of friends.

16:52.144 --> 16:54.814
And?
Oh, you know the answer.

16:54.814 --> 16:58.451
It was an unalloyed success.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.852
You conned Judd Foley,

16:59.852 --> 17:02.154
just as you conned
the Davenports before him.

17:02.154 --> 17:04.190
You might have fooled them,
but you don't fool me.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.360
You have trust issues.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.462
You have truth issues.

17:09.462 --> 17:12.131
What was it like
for you as a kid?

17:12.131 --> 17:15.535
I bet you lived
in a mansion.

17:15.535 --> 17:21.474
Lots of servants with white
gloves and feather dusters.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.643
Like one of those
shows on TV.

17:26.145 --> 17:28.347
I bet you never
had to be alone.

17:28.347 --> 17:31.984
Maybe Heather meant
that much to me.

17:31.984 --> 17:37.490
Maybe connecting with one
person, even for a short time,

17:37.490 --> 17:38.991
was that important.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.399
But I guess that's something
you wouldn't understand.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.675
Oh, you've been busy.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.679
Okay, so I recognize
these faces.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.315
New Jersey's Baby Formula Mafia.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.916
But who are these guys?

18:03.916 --> 18:07.486
That's the drug gang responsible
for Agent Underhill's death.

18:07.486 --> 18:11.557
I noticed while researching
the baby formula ring

18:11.557 --> 18:14.560
that several of its shoplifters
were drug offenders with records

18:14.560 --> 18:17.063
for drug possession,
dealing, etcetera.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.165
Well, that makes sense.

18:19.165 --> 18:23.336
I mean, they've had experience
trafficking illegal goods.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.605
And, as we noted before,

18:25.605 --> 18:28.007
Cassie could have been
indebted to the drug gang

18:28.007 --> 18:30.009
for having eliminated
Agent Underhill.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.445
So you're trying to
find the overlap

18:32.445 --> 18:34.013
between these two groups.

18:34.013 --> 18:36.582
You think that Cassie
is working for the gang.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.017
They want her
to find out everything

18:38.017 --> 18:39.285
the state police know.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.288
She used us as her way in.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.424
I did think that,
but I found no such overlap.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.026
Furthermore, several members
of the gang

18:47.026 --> 18:48.728
have been arrested
since that night.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.297
I've reviewed their testimonies,
and there's no indication

18:51.297 --> 18:53.099
that any of them have
heard of Cassie.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.900
So maybe she really didn't
have anything to do

18:54.900 --> 18:55.968
with Underhill's death.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.570
Where is she?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.739
She's in the spare room.
Said she needed to rest.

18:59.739 --> 19:00.806
How is she today?

19:00.806 --> 19:01.941
Obviously, it's hard to tell

19:01.941 --> 19:03.275
if anything she says is true.

19:03.275 --> 19:05.478
There was a moment this morning
she seemed genuine.

19:05.478 --> 19:09.749
I wonder if sometimes
she gets tired of lying.

19:09.749 --> 19:12.385
So, in spite of everything--

19:12.385 --> 19:15.621
all of her lies,
all the bad things she does--

19:15.621 --> 19:16.956
you like her, don't you?

19:16.956 --> 19:18.891
She possesses
a singular intellect.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.493
It would be a shame
to see it go to waste.

19:20.493 --> 19:24.130
And you have a soft spot
for singular intellects.

19:24.130 --> 19:27.600
(laughs)
She's no Moriarty.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.901
Not yet.

19:28.901 --> 19:32.138
(phone chimes)
It's Marcus.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.639
I suggested that he
and Detective Farrad

19:33.639 --> 19:35.241
interview Meredith Sagehorn.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.510
She lives in New York, so we're
going to meet at the 11th.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.779
I'm gonna go observe.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.280
Why don't you take
Cassie with you?

19:41.280 --> 19:43.182
I'm coming up short here.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.517
I was thinking of visiting
the halfway house

19:44.517 --> 19:45.751
she's been staying at.

19:45.751 --> 19:48.054
Perhaps I can find a clue
to her agenda there.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.299
Are your residents not allowed
to personalize their rooms?

20:00.299 --> 20:05.037
They're allowed.
Cassie just never did.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.806
We have a common room
downstairs.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.674
Uh, she spends a lot
of her time there,

20:08.674 --> 20:10.142
if you're interested.

20:11.477 --> 20:15.681
She keeps to herself,
even when she's down here.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.850
I think she tried
to make friends

20:17.850 --> 20:21.120
with the other girls early on,
but she didn't fit in.

20:21.120 --> 20:25.291
So mostly she just sits at
the computer and surfs the Web.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.326
Do you keep a record
of what they look at?

20:27.326 --> 20:28.527
Actually, we do.

20:28.527 --> 20:30.329
Every resident has
their own login.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.898
This way we can check their
browser history if we have to.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.101
Here.

20:39.472 --> 20:43.676
It's, uh, all crime blotter
stuff with her.

20:43.676 --> 20:47.847
Dead people. Kind
of an obsession.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.482
Morbid, right?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.420
LAWYER: The question I'd like
to start with, Detectives,

20:54.420 --> 20:56.889
is why Mrs. Sagehorn is still

20:56.889 --> 20:58.891
a suspect
in Heather Foley's murder.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.927
We're just trying to get
a picture of Mrs. Foley's life.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.195
She communicated a lot

21:03.195 --> 21:04.597
with your client.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.599
We figure, if she had
beef with anyone,

21:06.599 --> 21:08.033
you'd be the one to know.

21:08.033 --> 21:10.436
Heather and I
communicated so much

21:10.436 --> 21:12.204
because we didn't
just work together.

21:12.204 --> 21:14.740
My kids played with
her foster kids.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.342
We'd go on girls-only trips
together.

21:16.342 --> 21:18.210
Heather and I were friends.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.179
Which is something we have
been saying all along.

21:20.179 --> 21:22.214
And since they were close
friends, my client would have

21:22.214 --> 21:24.884
volunteered anything
right off the bat.

21:24.884 --> 21:28.954
So is this anything more
than a fishing expedition?

21:28.954 --> 21:31.390
FARRAD:
I don't see why you're taking
this as adversarial, Counselor.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.692
I'm sure that your client
wants us to be thorough,

21:33.692 --> 21:34.960
for her friend.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.030
Something wrong?
No.

21:38.030 --> 21:42.401
It's just, I've always been on
that side of rooms like this.

21:42.401 --> 21:44.436
I always wondered
what this side was like.

21:44.436 --> 21:47.239
Mm. It's funny
you should say that.

21:47.239 --> 21:49.909
Why?

21:49.909 --> 21:55.147
Because if Heather meant as much
to you as you say she did,

21:55.147 --> 21:56.949
and her suspected killer
was sitting right there,

21:56.949 --> 21:59.385
I don't buy that you'd even
notice this room, but...

21:59.385 --> 22:00.920
hey, stick to your story.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.592
Fine.

22:06.592 --> 22:09.895
You want to know the real reason
I showed up on your doorstep?

22:11.463 --> 22:14.400
I'll tell you.
You have to promise

22:14.400 --> 22:16.268
that you won't tell Sherlock
before I do.

22:16.268 --> 22:18.337
Tell him what?

22:18.337 --> 22:23.275
Has he ever mentioned a woman
named Pamela Fremont?

22:23.275 --> 22:25.077
No.

22:25.077 --> 22:27.846
He probably doesn't even
remember her.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.949
She's, um,

22:29.949 --> 22:32.351
not around anymore,
but she was a stock analyst,

22:32.351 --> 22:35.588
and back in the '90s,
she was flying a lot

22:35.588 --> 22:37.156
between London and New York.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.758
They met on a flight.

22:39.758 --> 22:42.461
Nine months later...

22:44.263 --> 22:45.664
...I was born.

22:45.664 --> 22:49.101
Are you trying to tell me
that Sherlock is your father?

22:51.537 --> 22:53.639
Nice try.

22:53.639 --> 22:56.041
MEREDITH:
I've told you this before.
(laughs softly)

22:56.041 --> 22:58.344
I was at a bookstore when
Heather was killed,

22:58.344 --> 23:00.212
waiting in line

23:00.212 --> 23:02.381
to get a book signed. There had
to be a hundred people there.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.783
You did, and we confirmed it.

23:04.783 --> 23:07.353
But you're a savvy
businesswoman.

23:07.353 --> 23:09.321
If you wanted to hurt
Heather, you could've found

23:09.321 --> 23:11.056
someone to do it for you.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.525
The book was a gift for Heather.

23:13.525 --> 23:15.294
She loved those, uh,
what do you call them,

23:15.294 --> 23:17.296
"bodice rippers," romance books

23:17.296 --> 23:19.498
with shirtless guys
on the covers.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.300
Why would I go
out of my way to get one

23:21.300 --> 23:23.903
signed for her
if I knew she'd be dead?

23:23.903 --> 23:25.804
She's telling the truth.

23:25.804 --> 23:28.474
She's innocent.

23:28.474 --> 23:31.010
I wouldn't jump to conclusions.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.578
MEREDITH:
Now you're making things up.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.046
Detective Farrad could be right.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.748
She got someone else
to kill Heather,

23:35.748 --> 23:38.384
and then alibied herself
by going to get Heather a gift.

23:38.384 --> 23:40.352
If she had, she wouldn't have
picked the gift that she did.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.023
When I first went
to visit Judd,

23:44.023 --> 23:46.725
I snooped around a little.
Not because I was conning him,

23:46.725 --> 23:49.561
because I was reminiscing
about Heather,

23:49.561 --> 23:51.597
and I kind of went
through her stuff.

23:51.597 --> 23:55.367
Point is, I saw some of the
books that she's talking about.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.536
They were hidden away
in the back of a drawer,

23:57.536 --> 23:59.938
like she was
embarrassed about them.

23:59.938 --> 24:03.042
She probably only told Meredith
'cause they were friends.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.778
If I was
choosing a gift

24:05.778 --> 24:07.446
to prove
that I didn't kill someone,

24:07.446 --> 24:10.849
I'd pick something
that everyone knew she liked,

24:10.849 --> 24:12.384
not something she kept secret.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.288
Hey, got your text.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.890
Why'd you want
to meet down here?

24:17.890 --> 24:19.792
Is our houseguest upstairs?

24:19.792 --> 24:21.427
Yeah. Why? What's going on?

24:21.427 --> 24:23.262
I think I know
what she's up to.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.030
Why she's here.

24:25.030 --> 24:27.232
These are all news stories she
was researching on the computer

24:27.232 --> 24:28.567
at her halfway house.

24:37.142 --> 24:40.145
These are all about
recent murders.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.081
Including Heather Foley's.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.315
They have more
in common than that.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.551
They're all unsolved murders

24:45.551 --> 24:48.420
which, at least publicly,
have the police stumped.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.289
Geographically, they're
all close, but not so close

24:50.289 --> 24:52.091
that the NYPD would be involved.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.326
They're all sympathetic victims.
There's a nurse,

24:54.326 --> 24:56.428
there's a foster mother,
a firefighter,

24:56.428 --> 24:59.264
all with domestic situations
she could fake her way into.

24:59.264 --> 25:00.966
So we were right. She had
no connection to Heather.

25:00.966 --> 25:02.601
She just picked a story
out of the news.

25:02.601 --> 25:04.470
Moreover,
the criteria with which

25:04.470 --> 25:06.672
she chose those stories
tells me why.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.942
We've been thinking
we were conduits

25:09.942 --> 25:12.411
through which Cassie hoped
to reach an ultimate goal.

25:13.645 --> 25:17.416
But we're not conduits,
we're the goal.

25:17.416 --> 25:19.785
Cassie's target is us.

25:27.426 --> 25:28.861
Now I get the real reason

25:28.861 --> 25:31.263
you gave me this phone.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.632
It's so you can
summon me whenever you...

25:34.767 --> 25:36.468
...want.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.270
Yes, these are the articles
that you researched,

25:38.270 --> 25:40.506
from which you selected
Heather Foley's murder.

25:40.506 --> 25:44.042
You chose her case for its
appropriateness to engage us.

25:44.042 --> 25:47.613
More specifically, to engage me.

25:49.515 --> 25:52.351
You're right. You got me.

25:52.351 --> 25:54.386
I read up on you
and your family

25:54.386 --> 25:56.221
while I was in prison.

25:56.221 --> 25:59.391
You're, like, really rich.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.860
Figured I'd find a way
to rip you off.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.395
No. You're still lying.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.664
What? I-I just admitted...

26:05.664 --> 26:07.633
This is not
about money.

26:07.633 --> 26:09.701
It's about being lonely.

26:09.701 --> 26:10.969
(scoffs)

26:10.969 --> 26:13.572
When you and I interacted
four years ago,

26:13.572 --> 26:16.141
I recognized that you're
not like other people.

26:16.141 --> 26:18.811
And I, and I strongly
suspect you sensed

26:18.811 --> 26:20.913
I'm not like other
people, either.

26:22.681 --> 26:25.350
I believe that one thing
you said yesterday is true,

26:25.350 --> 26:28.387
that making a connection
is as important to you

26:28.387 --> 26:30.322
as it is rare.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.024
And that's what you sought
by coming here, isn't it?

26:33.358 --> 26:35.127
A connection.

26:42.935 --> 26:46.205
It's like you said.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.106
You were different.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.776
You are different.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.511
You were wrong about my family.

26:53.745 --> 26:55.547
My mother died when I was young.

26:55.547 --> 26:58.183
My father was never much
of a father at all.

26:58.183 --> 27:02.554
To one extent or another,
I've always been alone.

27:02.554 --> 27:05.190
You have Joan.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.426
The people you work with.
Yeah.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.061
But in the grand scheme
of things,

27:09.061 --> 27:11.897
their presence in my life
is a new development.

27:11.897 --> 27:13.866
It's one I cherish.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.767
And while they deserve
the lion's share

27:15.767 --> 27:17.202
of the credit
for that,

27:17.202 --> 27:19.404
it's also thanks
to something that I did.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.642
I became a consulting detective.

27:23.642 --> 27:27.646
I was, for a time,
the only one in the world.

27:27.646 --> 27:31.750
I invented a
role for myself,

27:31.750 --> 27:34.953
I found a way
to take my difference

27:34.953 --> 27:37.823
and turn it into something
I could use to contribute.

27:39.124 --> 27:40.859
Say you're right about me.

27:42.461 --> 27:46.498
I want to change,
I want to "contribute."

27:46.498 --> 27:48.500
You're saying I have
to become a detective?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.502
No, that was my solution.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.238
No doubt,
yours will be different.

27:53.238 --> 27:55.741
So what do I become?

27:55.741 --> 27:57.910
I've got no idea.

28:00.112 --> 28:03.949
But if you really want
to be a better person,

28:03.949 --> 28:07.219
I could help you figure it out.

28:10.088 --> 28:13.926
So you don't think Meredith
Sagehorn killed Heather Foley.

28:13.926 --> 28:16.762
We'd say the odds are pretty
slim. Detective Farrad agrees.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.630
That said,
we could still use your help.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.465
Even if Sagehorn didn't do it,

28:20.465 --> 28:22.968
someone in her organization
might have, for the same reason.

28:22.968 --> 28:25.003
WATSON: Heather was
cooperating with you.

28:25.003 --> 28:26.638
That meant she was a threat
to the entire ring.

28:26.638 --> 28:27.806
Any one of them

28:27.806 --> 28:29.508
would have been worried
about losing income,

28:29.508 --> 28:31.643
or going to prison.

28:31.643 --> 28:32.978
We've been thinking
the same thing.

28:32.978 --> 28:34.546
Sagehorn or not, whoever
killed Heather Foley,

28:34.546 --> 28:37.549
we have to assume
my cover is blown,

28:37.549 --> 28:38.984
and that people
inside the ring

28:38.984 --> 28:40.185
might have their guards up.

28:40.185 --> 28:41.987
That mean you guys
are backing off?

28:41.987 --> 28:43.522
CALABRISSI:
Well, for now.

28:43.522 --> 28:44.723
You know, long enough

28:44.723 --> 28:46.525
to let the ring
feel comfortable again.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.360
Then we can try to turn
another lieutenant

28:48.360 --> 28:50.162
with a different undercover.

28:50.162 --> 28:52.164
At any rate,
we'd love to help you out,

28:52.164 --> 28:53.832
I just don't know how we can.

28:53.832 --> 28:55.200
You know, Farrad
already ruled out

28:55.200 --> 28:56.168
all the other
known members

28:56.168 --> 28:57.336
of the organization

28:57.336 --> 28:59.338
as suspects in the Foley murder.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.506
Which is why we want
to look into members

29:01.506 --> 29:02.741
that you don't
know yet.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.543
So, my partner and I
noticed these photos

29:04.543 --> 29:06.378
the last time we were here.
Those were taken

29:06.378 --> 29:08.246
by security cameras
at retail stores, right?

29:08.246 --> 29:11.316
Those companies are helping you
identify shoplifters.

29:11.316 --> 29:13.318
If you guys are willing
to make the introductions,

29:13.318 --> 29:14.987
we'd like to reach out,
go through

29:14.987 --> 29:16.054
their security footage
ourselves.

29:16.054 --> 29:17.155
WATSON: We might
be able to identify

29:17.155 --> 29:19.691
someone that they missed.

29:19.691 --> 29:22.761
BENDIX: Leehoven's has
over a thousand stores

29:22.761 --> 29:24.396
in the tristate area.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.331
400 in New Jersey alone.

29:26.331 --> 29:29.334
We coordinate loss prevention
for the whole company here,

29:29.334 --> 29:31.003
and my team keeps
a running collection

29:31.003 --> 29:33.505
of anyone we spot
boosting formula.

29:33.505 --> 29:36.575
And what you're looking at here
is the last three months.

29:36.575 --> 29:39.611
We share the images
between stores.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.613
And lately,
the state police.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.615
Leehoven's is very proactive

29:43.615 --> 29:45.717
about working
with law enforcement.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.052
Have you added that guy
to your collection yet?

29:48.754 --> 29:50.956
Why? Did you see him steal?

29:50.956 --> 29:52.691
CASSIE:
No, but he wants to.

29:52.691 --> 29:54.393
He's been reading
different boxes

29:54.393 --> 29:57.729
of the same cereal over and over
again, for like, forever.

29:57.729 --> 30:00.198
What he's really doing is
waiting for the aisle to clear

30:00.198 --> 30:01.600
before he can make his move.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.368
Good catch.

30:03.368 --> 30:05.137
I'll have my people
keep an eye out for him.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.205
HOLMES: That's
you, is it not?

30:07.205 --> 30:09.741
BENDIX:
Yeah.

30:09.741 --> 30:11.376
I do store visits once a week.

30:11.376 --> 30:13.945
The fancy threads
are because I had testified

30:13.945 --> 30:15.981
before the state senate
that day.

30:15.981 --> 30:18.383
Oh, yeah? What about?
As it happens,

30:18.383 --> 30:19.618
baby formula.

30:19.618 --> 30:21.119
The state gives
cash vouchers

30:21.119 --> 30:23.755
to needy moms to help
feed their kids.

30:23.755 --> 30:26.224
Formula is one
of the foods covered.

30:26.224 --> 30:27.726
Why'd you have to testify?

30:27.726 --> 30:30.162
That doesn't sound
very controversial.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.731
You'd be surprised.

30:32.731 --> 30:35.167
Thanks to baby formula being
free to so many customers,

30:35.167 --> 30:37.102
the prices get
artificially jacked up,

30:37.102 --> 30:39.771
and high prices
incentivize crime.

30:39.771 --> 30:41.740
So the state
is considering

30:41.740 --> 30:43.742
dropping formula
from the program.

30:46.411 --> 30:50.582
CASSIE: Guess I have an eye
for spotting thieves, huh?

30:50.582 --> 30:52.417
Now you say
something like:

30:52.417 --> 30:55.087
thieves are just another
form of liars, right?

30:55.087 --> 30:58.190
No, you have a talent.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.325
Uh, the stuff
you said earlier,

31:00.325 --> 31:02.627
I, um, I have to
think about it.

31:02.627 --> 31:05.497
Yes, of course.
So when we get back
to your place,

31:05.497 --> 31:07.132
you want to split
the footage up?

31:07.132 --> 31:08.867
No, I don't.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.002
But only 'cause I don't
think it's necessary.

31:11.002 --> 31:13.705
I'm considering a new
theory of the crime.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.974
Heather Foley was on
the verge of introducing

31:15.974 --> 31:17.375
an undercover detective
to Meredith Sagehorn.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.444
Had he succeeded

31:19.444 --> 31:21.780
in gaining her trust, a takedown
of the entire operation

31:21.780 --> 31:23.115
would've quickly followed.

31:23.115 --> 31:26.284
Right, so how is that
a new theory?

31:26.284 --> 31:28.186
'Cause I'm now focused
on the timing.

31:28.186 --> 31:29.688
According to what
Bendix said,

31:29.688 --> 31:33.291
state senate will soon be voting
on baby formula subsidies.

31:33.291 --> 31:35.160
When the state police
execute their warrant

31:35.160 --> 31:37.129
of Mrs. Sagehorn's crime ring,

31:37.129 --> 31:38.296
that's going to
generate headlines,

31:38.296 --> 31:40.232
and those headlines
may well sway the vote

31:40.232 --> 31:41.700
against the
subsidies.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.369
But a lot of people make
a lot of money off those moms

31:44.369 --> 31:46.037
getting free formula.
Yeah.

31:46.037 --> 31:49.508
Imagine the losses if people
stopped buying formula en masse.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.409
You think someone killed Heather

31:51.409 --> 31:54.012
to stall the investigation
until after the vote.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.316
(door closes)

32:00.385 --> 32:02.487
Did I hear correctly
that one of our clients,

32:02.487 --> 32:04.689
John Garrideb,
has been arrested?

32:04.689 --> 32:08.426
You did. It turns out
that John Garrideb

32:08.426 --> 32:10.262
only convinced Nathan Garrideb

32:10.262 --> 32:12.164
to come here to find
Howard Garrideb,

32:12.164 --> 32:13.999
so that John's friends
could steal a fortune

32:13.999 --> 32:16.001
from Nathan's house
while he was away.

32:16.001 --> 32:18.570
Scotland Yard picked up
the accomplices in London.

32:18.570 --> 32:21.573
John is on his way to jail,
and Nathan is on his way home.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.742
How's it been
going here?

32:23.742 --> 32:26.011
Also productive.

32:26.011 --> 32:27.879
Working off the new theory
that I texted you,

32:27.879 --> 32:30.415
Cassie and I identified
a list of suspects.

32:30.415 --> 32:32.017
Top executives at companies

32:32.017 --> 32:33.418
that make
baby formula

32:33.418 --> 32:36.288
and owners of companies
that sell it.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.890
So people who benefit
from its high prices.

32:38.890 --> 32:41.693
Mm. And while we
don't yet have proof,

32:41.693 --> 32:43.628
our focus
quickly narrowed

32:43.628 --> 32:46.398
to Mack Leehoven
himself,

32:46.398 --> 32:49.267
founder and CEO
of Leehoven's Supermarkets.

32:49.267 --> 32:51.269
One, his empire is just

32:51.269 --> 32:54.372
the right size. Most of his
stores are in New Jersey,

32:54.372 --> 32:55.774
so that makes him
particularly vulnerable

32:55.774 --> 32:57.776
to the impact
of the vote.

32:57.776 --> 33:00.879
Two, my research revealed
that Mr. Leehoven himself

33:00.879 --> 33:02.747
has personally
bent over backwards

33:02.747 --> 33:04.583
to ensure his company's
cooperation

33:04.583 --> 33:05.917
with the state police.

33:05.917 --> 33:08.453
Well, that seems
counterintuitive.

33:08.453 --> 33:09.921
You're saying that
the investigation's

33:09.921 --> 33:11.957
strongest supporter
is also its saboteur.

33:11.957 --> 33:14.893
I submit that
Mr. Leehoven's real goal

33:14.893 --> 33:16.828
is to ensure himself
a front row seat

33:16.828 --> 33:18.430
to the investigation's progress.

33:18.430 --> 33:21.633
Okay, but like you said,
none of that is proof.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.902
Which is why I've asked
our favorite hacker collective

33:23.902 --> 33:25.403
to poke around.

33:25.403 --> 33:27.272
Cassie and I agree
that it's far more likely

33:27.272 --> 33:29.274
Mr. Leehoven hired someone
to execute Heather

33:29.274 --> 33:30.675
rather than do it himself.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.911
I'm hoping there'll be
some evidence in his

33:32.911 --> 33:34.346
financial or phone records.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.181
I'm hoping to hear
something shortly.

33:36.181 --> 33:38.049
Cassie already went to bed?

33:39.351 --> 33:42.187
Well, seems like you guys
make a great team.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.356
Not that I'm jealous.
I think it's good.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.324
I mean, I take it the
conversation with her went well?

33:46.324 --> 33:49.494
What you said about her not
being a criminal mastermind yet

33:49.494 --> 33:50.762
stuck with me,

33:50.762 --> 33:53.798
so I endeavored to offer her
an alternative path.

33:53.798 --> 33:55.867
I daresay I might've
got through.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.970
That must feel good.
It's not long ago

33:58.970 --> 34:00.438
that you and I
stood and listened

34:00.438 --> 34:02.173
to Odin Reichenbach's
misguided speech

34:02.173 --> 34:04.009
about preventing crime
before it happens.

34:04.009 --> 34:06.711
To my mind, this might
be the right kind

34:06.711 --> 34:08.580
of prevention.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.788
(alarm beeping)

34:26.665 --> 34:29.267
"Living room window open"?

34:34.005 --> 34:35.941
(keypad beeping)

34:48.587 --> 34:49.921
(keypad beeping)

34:49.921 --> 34:53.024
You're a bad man, Mr. Leehoven.

34:53.024 --> 34:55.226
Who the hell are you?

34:55.226 --> 34:56.962
Someone who knows what you did.

34:58.396 --> 35:01.700
You had Heather Foley murdered.

35:04.869 --> 35:07.038
But I'd be happy
not to tell anyone.

35:07.038 --> 35:09.074
In exchange for,

35:09.074 --> 35:12.711
say, $2 million?

36:05.497 --> 36:07.332
So any of the foster
homes you stay in

36:07.332 --> 36:09.034
have a copy of Aesop's Fables?

36:09.034 --> 36:10.301
Listen...

36:10.301 --> 36:12.103
One particular story
came to mind tonight

36:12.103 --> 36:13.438
about a farmer
and a snake.

36:13.438 --> 36:15.840
A farmer walked through
his field one winter morning.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.143
On the ground lay a snake,
frozen stiff from the cold.

36:18.143 --> 36:20.178
The farmer knew how deadly
the snake could be,

36:20.178 --> 36:21.479
and yet he picked it up,

36:21.479 --> 36:23.081
and held it to his bosom
for warmth.

36:23.081 --> 36:24.315
When the snake revived,

36:24.315 --> 36:26.618
it bit the farmer
who had been so kind to him,

36:26.618 --> 36:28.386
and as he lay dying,
the farmer said,

36:28.386 --> 36:32.057
"I am rightly served, for
showing pity to a scoundrel."

36:32.057 --> 36:33.858
Do I get to talk?

36:33.858 --> 36:36.461
I'd rather you didn't.
I already know everything.

36:36.461 --> 36:38.296
My associates
at Everyone did not find

36:38.296 --> 36:40.298
any incriminating evidence
against Mack Leehoven.

36:40.298 --> 36:42.167
They did, however,

36:42.167 --> 36:44.002
tell me that there had been
an alarm system breach

36:44.002 --> 36:45.470
at his home tonight.

36:45.470 --> 36:47.705
I found that too coincidental,
and so I checked your room.

36:47.705 --> 36:51.142
You were right. Leehoven did it.
I saw it on his face.

36:51.142 --> 36:52.577
I don't know
what I expected.

36:52.577 --> 36:54.846
Whatever it was,
I was wasting my breath.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.314
On the bright side,

36:56.314 --> 36:58.016
neither an ambulance
nor a coroner

36:58.016 --> 36:59.984
has been dispatched
to Leehoven's home tonight,

36:59.984 --> 37:03.321
so I take it you only shook
him down. How much did you get?

37:03.321 --> 37:05.723
A million? Two?

37:05.723 --> 37:08.660
You're the smartest,
just like always.

37:08.660 --> 37:09.794
You figured everything out.

37:11.529 --> 37:13.598
Except there's one question
you haven't thought of yet.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.769
Why would I
have come back?

37:17.769 --> 37:19.704
You called it, okay?

37:19.704 --> 37:21.673
Leehoven didn't
kill Heather himself.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.741
He paid someone
to do it for him.

37:23.741 --> 37:26.044
He confirmed this?
No.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.880
But the guy I just met, he's
never even done his own laundry.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.616
We discussed the possibility
that he had a fixer,

37:31.616 --> 37:34.085
someone to take care
of his problems for him.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.854
I didn't take Leehoven's money.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.789
I set up a meeting
to take his money,

37:37.789 --> 37:40.291
about four hours
from now.

37:40.291 --> 37:45.296
I made myself a problem
that needs to be fixed.

37:45.296 --> 37:48.333
So is it just me, or wouldn't
you like to see who shows up?

37:59.477 --> 38:01.880
Calabrissi was
Leehoven's fixer.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.915
Leehoven paid him
to keep him informed

38:03.915 --> 38:06.084
about how the state police
investigation was going.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.585
In particular, how they
had flipped Heather

38:07.585 --> 38:10.088
and how she was gonna help them
take the whole ring down.

38:10.088 --> 38:14.058
And since Leehoven wanted to
slow down the investigation,

38:14.058 --> 38:16.060
he had Calabrissi
kill Heather.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.463
BELL: Sherlock
and Cassie made it so

38:18.463 --> 38:20.732
Leehoven thought Cassie was
blackmailing him to keep quiet.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.834
They set up
a meet in a lot

38:22.834 --> 38:25.570
out in Red Hook, and Leehoven
sent Calabrissi instead.

38:25.570 --> 38:26.804
He had a nine millimeter

38:26.804 --> 38:28.907
handgun on him when
we picked him up,

38:28.907 --> 38:30.175
wasn't registered
in his name.

38:30.175 --> 38:31.643
Ballistics is putting
a rush on it,

38:31.643 --> 38:33.311
but I'm betting it'll
be the same weapon

38:33.311 --> 38:34.612
that was used
to kill Heather.

38:34.612 --> 38:36.481
From what I heard,
Calabrissi was already

38:36.481 --> 38:38.983
offering to give Leehoven up
on the ride over here.

38:38.983 --> 38:41.419
And how'd this all get set up?

38:41.419 --> 38:42.821
It was Sherlock
and Cassie's idea.

38:44.189 --> 38:47.192
Once we had Leehoven
on the hook, we called Marcus.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.693
I got in touch
with Detective Farrad,

38:48.693 --> 38:50.261
and we took it from there.

38:50.261 --> 38:51.496
And so what's
this mean?

38:51.496 --> 38:53.865
Cassie Lenue's gonna be
one of the good guys now?

38:53.865 --> 38:57.468
Honestly? I have no idea
what Cassie's gonna be.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.107
HOLMES: I hear you dropped out
of your high school

39:03.107 --> 39:04.442
equivalency prep class.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.046
You checking up on me?

39:08.046 --> 39:10.648
As per our agreement.

39:10.648 --> 39:13.318
I was gonna tell you.

39:13.318 --> 39:14.719
I already knew
everything

39:14.719 --> 39:17.889
they were teaching, so I just
decided to skip the class

39:17.889 --> 39:19.390
and apply for the test.

39:19.390 --> 39:21.793
I brought you something.

39:21.793 --> 39:25.063
Like, a present?

39:25.063 --> 39:29.234
It's been troubling me that
you don't know your own name.

39:29.234 --> 39:30.969
If we want you to find

39:30.969 --> 39:34.806
a place in the world, then you
need to know who you are.

39:36.641 --> 39:39.744
You're more than a mere Lenue.

39:39.744 --> 39:43.715
If you found the names
of my real parents

39:43.715 --> 39:45.149
or something like that...

39:45.149 --> 39:46.918
what happened,

39:46.918 --> 39:49.587
why they gave me up,

39:49.587 --> 39:52.557
I...

39:52.557 --> 39:55.693
I don't want to know.

39:55.693 --> 39:58.363
I guess I've always figured

39:58.363 --> 40:00.765
that's not a story
I want to hear.

40:00.765 --> 40:04.502
I suspected as much.

40:04.502 --> 40:08.773
I mean, if you wanted to know,
you would've found out yourself.

40:08.773 --> 40:11.276
And I don't think you need be
defined by your past,

40:11.276 --> 40:15.580
so, uh, what I've brought
is just a form.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.548
It's much like the one
you're filling out now,

40:17.548 --> 40:19.550
but you might want
to fill that one out first.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.390
An application
to change my name?

40:25.390 --> 40:27.926
You'll need to sign it
in the presence of a notary

40:27.926 --> 40:29.427
and submit it to the court,

40:29.427 --> 40:32.063
but it will allow you

40:32.063 --> 40:34.632
to decide who you are.

40:34.632 --> 40:37.535
♪ The bridges you're walking,
the bridges you've burned ♪

40:37.535 --> 40:40.805
What do you say--

40:40.805 --> 40:43.241
come up with some
names together?

40:43.241 --> 40:47.345
♪ Some go high, some go low. ♪

40:49.881 --> 40:55.353
♪ Keep in mind
the places you'll go. ♪
