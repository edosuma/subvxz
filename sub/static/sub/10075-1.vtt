00:55.097 --> 00:58.725
Now at the hour of our death, Amen.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.621
I'll get you!

01:27.129 --> 01:28.714
I'll get in, Mrs. Tredoni.

01:33.885 --> 01:34.928
Hi, Tom.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.097
Good to see you!

01:37.306 --> 01:38.640
Mama said you wanted to see me.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.017
Did she now?

01:40.225 --> 01:41.935
Now, why would I wanna see you?

01:42.144 --> 01:42.853
You know.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.582
Now, did you make a good confession.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.190
Yes, Father.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.775
Do you have a present for me?

01:50.068 --> 01:51.695
Of course I do, in the dining room.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.119
Did you find it?

01:59.328 --> 02:00.537
Where?

02:00.746 --> 02:03.457
Here, here, some of Mrs.
Tredoni's delicious cookies.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.042
Sit down, sit down.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.668
Are you sure this is my present?

02:06.877 --> 02:08.502
I am, Alice, why don't you sit down?

02:08.711 --> 02:11.506
No thanks, Father.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.216
I have to go to the bathroom.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.527
What's wrong, sweetheart, go ahead.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.178
You know where it is.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.087
You nasty child!

02:51.171 --> 02:52.005
Out of my kitchen!

02:54.466 --> 02:56.885
Take that thing off your face!

02:57.094 --> 02:59.304
Who said you could go wandering around?

02:59.513 --> 03:01.264
I thought you had to go to the bathroom.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.392
I'm sorry, Mrs. Trendoni.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.477
You probably frightened her half to death.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.730
Now go inside and sit down
and try to act like a lady!

03:12.484 --> 03:13.193
Tom, I'm sorry.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.904
It's all right, I'm sure
she didn't mean any harm.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.158
Karen, open your present!

03:20.367 --> 03:21.618
We all wanna see what it is.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.251
It's beautiful!

03:30.836 --> 03:31.796
Belonged to my mother.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.422
Tom, you shouldn't have!

03:33.630 --> 03:34.923
What if she loses it?

03:35.132 --> 03:36.572
Who else would I give it to, Kate?

03:36.633 --> 03:39.344
I love you, Father
Tom, I really love you!

03:39.553 --> 03:41.096
I know you'll take good care of it.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.557
It's just lovely!

04:28.018 --> 04:29.936
<i>'</i> Mommy, Mommy!

04:30.145 --> 04:30.854
Alice?

04:33.356 --> 04:36.985
Alice?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.740
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

04:41.948 --> 04:43.325
What is it?

04:43.533 --> 04:45.786
What'd she do to you now?

04:45.994 --> 04:47.120
Are you all right?

04:47.329 --> 04:49.039
She took it, she's going to break it!

04:49.247 --> 04:50.957
I had it all wrapped up, and she took it!

04:51.166 --> 04:52.000
What did she take?

04:52.209 --> 04:54.377
She took my doll, the doll Daddy sent me,

04:54.586 --> 04:56.505
she's going to break it, I know she is!

04:56.713 --> 04:59.633
No, she won't, I promise
you, she won't break it.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.302
Honey, I have to get to
Seller's before they close.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.554
You want me to get your dress, don't you?

05:04.763 --> 05:05.388
Yes.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.306
Okay-

05:16.983 --> 05:17.776
- Alice!

05:29.162 --> 05:29.955
Alice!

06:04.573 --> 06:05.365
Alice!

06:06.992 --> 06:07.784
Alice!

06:13.707 --> 06:15.417
Alice, where are you?

06:20.505 --> 06:25.093
Mommy says you're to come
home right this instant!

06:25.302 --> 06:27.512
And give me my doll back.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.430
Where are you?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.724
Why are you running away from me?

06:34.769 --> 06:36.247
Didn't I tell you never to follow me?

06:36.271 --> 06:37.522
Where's my doll?

06:41.067 --> 06:44.154
No, no, let me out!

06:44.362 --> 06:46.907
Let me out, no!

06:47.115 --> 06:50.160
Let me out, let me out!

06:53.455 --> 06:55.248
If you tell Mommy about this,

06:55.457 --> 06:58.627
you're never gonna see that
doll again, now go home!

07:12.349 --> 07:13.229
Where's your sister?

07:13.391 --> 07:15.602
She's coming, Mom, my dress!

07:15.810 --> 07:17.479
Where have you been going, Alice?

07:17.687 --> 07:19.081
Don't think you can keep things from me,

07:19.105 --> 07:20.665
you're not going to get away with this!

07:20.857 --> 07:23.485
Why should you care
where I go, I'm not Karen!

07:23.693 --> 07:26.154
I want the table set immediately.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.221
I don't like this new habit of yours,

07:31.326 --> 07:33.912
disappearing when you're
told to do something.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.431
You're old enough to know better.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.599
Sometimes, I think you don't care

07:36.623 --> 07:38.041
about anybody but yourself.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.254
She's ruining my veil!

07:42.420 --> 07:44.005
Make her take it off!

07:44.881 --> 07:47.926
Take your sister's veil off!

07:48.134 --> 07:49.511
Make her take it off, Mommy!

07:50.679 --> 07:51.388
Alice!

07:51.596 --> 07:52.931
Take your own veil!

07:53.139 --> 07:54.891
I don't want this stupid
thing thing anyway!

07:55.100 --> 07:56.202
Alice, what's wrong with you?

07:56.226 --> 07:57.477
What's gotten into you?

07:57.686 --> 07:59.604
I don't understand you!

07:59.813 --> 08:01.481
It's ruined!

08:01.690 --> 08:03.233
All right.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.068
See, nothing happened to it.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.864
You look beautiful!

08:10.073 --> 08:10.782
Go look.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.623
You're gonna be the prettiest girl there.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.209
Wait till Father Tom sees you.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.568
Are Mama's little babies hungry?

08:49.446 --> 08:50.321
Well, Mama is.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.160
There.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.748
Look what Mama has.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.917
There,

09:30.737 --> 09:32.822
Psst, where are you going?

09:33.031 --> 09:34.449
None of your business, fatso.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.205
Yeah, I'm not feeling well!

09:40.413 --> 09:42.749
Stores don't deliver on Sunday!

09:43.750 --> 09:46.586
Won't you have to go to
the store for me, please?

09:51.049 --> 09:52.509
That little bitch!

10:14.572 --> 10:15.323
Move over!

10:18.284 --> 10:18.924
Where's Alice?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.245
I don't know.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.873
Angela, go find Alice.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.042
Take your coat with you!

10:25.208 --> 10:26.209
It is not necessary,

10:26.417 --> 10:29.003
I was just out there, and she's not there!

10:29.212 --> 10:30.130
Where can she be?

10:30.338 --> 10:31.464
I don't know.

10:35.009 --> 10:38.179
All right, girls, let's get ready now.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.643
Straighten up now,
all your veils straight?

10:43.852 --> 10:44.477
Psst!

10:44.686 --> 10:47.480
One, two, three, one, two, three.

10:48.439 --> 10:52.569
One, two, three, one, two,
three, one, two, three.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.360
Alice.

13:57.587 --> 13:58.755
What's she doing?

13:58.963 --> 14:01.049
She's got no business up there!

14:01.257 --> 14:02.337
For God's sake, go get her!

14:35.375 --> 14:37.668
My God, where's Angela?

14:38.628 --> 14:41.005
What is going on, look out!

14:41.214 --> 14:43.134
Please be calm, there's
nothing to worry about!

14:43.174 --> 14:44.759
Keep calm, everyone, please!

14:52.850 --> 14:56.145
My God!

14:56.354 --> 14:57.146
Where were you?

14:57.355 --> 14:58.415
I wanted Communion, Mommy,

14:58.439 --> 14:59.583
Father wouldn't give me the host!

14:59.607 --> 15:00.733
Help me find Karen.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.744
- Let me go to her!
- No, no!

15:11.953 --> 15:13.496
Let me go, please!

15:15.957 --> 15:17.157
Where did you get that veil?

15:17.208 --> 15:19.043
I found it on the floor when I came in.

15:19.252 --> 15:19.877
Where is she?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.246
I was gonna give it to her.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.257
No, I don't want to!

15:24.465 --> 15:27.176
What is the matter with you, come on!

15:27.385 --> 15:29.637
Please, stop!

15:29.846 --> 15:30.721
Catherine!

15:31.889 --> 15:33.433
Let go of me!

15:33.641 --> 15:35.268
She's dead!

15:35.476 --> 15:36.185
<i>_</i> Let go!

15:37.145 --> 15:39.230
She's dead!

15:39.439 --> 15:41.357
Karen's dead, she's dead!

15:43.651 --> 15:44.694
Karen's dead!

15:53.244 --> 15:55.788
Father, Father, what's happening?

16:02.795 --> 16:03.588
No,

16:05.506 --> 16:09.385
Ho!

16:11.888 --> 16:14.348
No!

17:15.117 --> 17:17.328
We're ready, Mrs. Spages.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.253
As I call out your names,

17:26.462 --> 17:28.589
kindly take your places
in the assigned cars.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.426
Mrs. Falco and Andrea.

17:33.928 --> 17:37.557
Mrs. Grassi and Mrs. Bruno.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.328
10-4, Brennan.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.124
The fat one didn't show up.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.001
Did you find out where the girl was?

18:05.209 --> 18:08.087
Her mother says she was helping the nuns.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.547
Did you talk to any of them?

18:09.755 --> 18:12.592
No, not yet.

18:19.473 --> 18:20.433
Who's that?

18:20.641 --> 18:21.809
The father.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.453
Well, at least he managed to get here

18:23.477 --> 18:24.830
before they put her in the ground.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.355
Annie, please, not now!

18:39.785 --> 18:42.872
I'm so glad you're here.

18:45.416 --> 18:46.496
What are they, separated?

18:46.542 --> 18:47.793
He's remarried.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.009
I don't wanna rush you,

18:56.177 --> 18:57.803
but mass begins at nine.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.443
Hi, Ally.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.380
Ally, sit on the fold-up,
make room for your father.

19:15.404 --> 19:16.739
I want to stay where I am.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.825
Please do what you're told!

19:20.034 --> 19:22.578
Annie, please, there is plenty of room.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.873
No problem, I can sit on the fold-up.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.084
Never mind, I'll sit in the second car.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.714
There's room up here, Annie.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.052
Move over.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.345
What?

19:39.553 --> 19:40.846
I said move over!

20:02.660 --> 20:05.955
I want you to find out
exactly where that girl was,

20:06.163 --> 20:07.963
and I'd like to talk to
that Alfonse character

20:08.082 --> 20:09.667
before they get back from the grave.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.335
Let's

20:15.673 --> 20:17.466
It's such a tragedy!

20:17.675 --> 20:19.635
We're not even safe in the church anymore!

20:20.928 --> 20:22.346
That darling little Ally,

20:22.555 --> 20:24.140
she's takin' it so well!

20:24.348 --> 20:25.748
Your husband and I were just sayin'

20:25.850 --> 20:28.269
what a great help she's
been to her mother.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.312
Hey, and you make sure you tell Catherine

20:30.521 --> 20:33.399
that she must call me at
once if she needs anything.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.026
Thank you, there's nothing anyone can do.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.778
I'll be staying here with my sister

20:37.987 --> 20:40.197
for as long as she needs me.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.368
Angela, stop eating,
haven't you had enough?

20:44.577 --> 20:47.413
Jim, help me clean up this
mess, you don't need that drink.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.958
I've made arrangements to stay in town

20:51.167 --> 20:51.977
for the next few days.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.502
I'll be here if you need me.

20:53.711 --> 20:54.831
Don't you have to go home?

20:55.004 --> 20:57.423
You don't have to stay,
I'll be here for a while.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.718
Annie, you're only 10 minutes away,

21:00.926 --> 21:03.179
and Jim and the children need you.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.764
Catherine, please!

21:04.972 --> 21:06.640
Jim wants me to be here.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.618
My Angela can take care
of everything at home,

21:08.642 --> 21:09.522
isn't that right, Jim?

21:09.727 --> 21:10.519
<i>'</i> Beg your pardon?

21:10.728 --> 21:12.605
Angela can take care
of everything at home!

21:12.813 --> 21:14.064
Of course, dear, yes.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.486
Okay, I,

21:18.694 --> 21:20.571
I know this is a bad time to bring it up,

21:20.780 --> 21:23.491
but there's some things
we have to talk about.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.451
This is no ordinary situation.

21:25.659 --> 21:26.368
I know.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.955
I just don't know where to start.

21:30.164 --> 21:31.957
Is it necessary to have the conversation

21:32.166 --> 21:33.501
in front of the children?

21:33.709 --> 21:36.378
Goddammit, Annie, the child was murdered!

21:36.587 --> 21:38.964
Or don't you understand what that means?

21:39.173 --> 21:41.533
Ask the kids to leave, there's
some things I'd like to know.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.677
Listen, there's an
awful lot of cake left.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.889
It's a shame to let it go to waste.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.560
Alice, would you bring
this down to Mr. Alphonso

21:52.520 --> 21:54.563
and thank him for the lovely flowers.

21:54.772 --> 21:57.191
Angela, Robert, go with her!

21:57.399 --> 21:59.568
Don't disappear, keep the noise down!

22:15.876 --> 22:17.711
I heard everyone leave.

22:17.920 --> 22:18.754
It's all over?

22:20.005 --> 22:22.883
Well, you die and they
put you in the ground.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.470
It's over.

22:26.679 --> 22:27.388
Such a shame.

22:29.849 --> 22:33.644
Such a pretty girl, too.

22:33.853 --> 22:37.565
Too bad she was the one
to end up in the box.

22:42.528 --> 22:45.030
My mother thought you
could use some cake, fatty.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.617
Thank your mother for me.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.911
Such a lovely lady.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.247
God always takes the pretty ones.

22:55.749 --> 22:56.834
Is he fat!

22:57.042 --> 22:58.752
He scares me!

23:01.297 --> 23:03.507
That ugly bastard doesn't scare me.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.235
Come on, Alice, let's get out of here

23:05.259 --> 23:06.719
before my mother hears you.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.684
Robert, don't follow us.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.895
I told you, we don't want you with us!

23:21.650 --> 23:23.410
What the hell's
the matter with you people?

23:23.527 --> 23:26.363
You have no idea what I'm talking about.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.907
Whatchu trying to say?

23:28.115 --> 23:30.326
Alice was the last one in that church.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.553
So what's that supposed to mean?

23:31.577 --> 23:33.297
What do you think
that's supposed to mean?

23:33.329 --> 23:35.915
Stop it, I won't listen to this again!

23:38.417 --> 23:40.377
You saw the photographers at the church.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.130
The police do investigate
a murder, you know?

23:43.339 --> 23:45.483
I still don't understand
what that has to do with Alice.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.843
Everyone knew she was
the last one in the church.

23:48.052 --> 23:48.987
They want to talk to her,

23:49.011 --> 23:50.721
they think she may have seen someone.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.307
What if the police find
out about the veil?

23:53.515 --> 23:54.224
What veil?

23:55.559 --> 23:56.661
Jim, what's she talking about?

23:56.685 --> 23:59.355
She had Karen's veil in her pocket.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.232
For Christ's sake, she
probably found it on the floor.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.944
I'm sure you didn't even
ask her where she got it.

24:09.031 --> 24:10.741
Annie, Why'd you have to start this?

24:10.950 --> 24:12.868
I think you've gone too far.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.204
Shut up, I know what I'm doing.

24:49.738 --> 24:53.909
I have an appointment
with Detective Brennan.

24:54.118 --> 24:56.537
Take the elevator to the third floor.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.414
Make a left, his name's on the door.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.274
It's open, come in.

25:25.482 --> 25:25.982
What?

25:32.906 --> 25:34.450
Sorry about your daughter.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.136
I guess you've got a lotta questions.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.137
Yeah, you're right, I was,

25:37.161 --> 25:38.801
I was hopin' you could tell me something.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.039
As a matter of fact,

25:40.247 --> 25:42.458
my partner's out in
your neighborhood next.

25:42.666 --> 25:43.917
Is, anything being done

25:44.126 --> 25:45.311
to protect Catherine and my daughter?

25:45.335 --> 25:48.005
What makes you think you need protection?

25:48.213 --> 25:49.923
I don't know, I,

25:50.132 --> 25:52.259
I couldn't imagine anyone killing Karen.

25:52.468 --> 25:55.637
People do crazy things.

25:55.846 --> 25:58.182
Mr. Spages, do you
mind if I talk to Alice?

25:59.933 --> 26:01.393
Where's that gonna get you?

26:01.602 --> 26:03.038
Alice was the last one
to go into the church.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.897
She might've seen something,

26:05.105 --> 26:06.690
something she knows nothing about,

26:07.816 --> 26:10.319
but might set us in the right direction.

26:12.196 --> 26:13.655
For example, the veil.

26:13.864 --> 26:15.908
Exactly where did she find that veil?

26:19.620 --> 26:22.206
Ray-

26:23.791 --> 26:25.584
- Listen, about the veil,

26:25.793 --> 26:29.088
it's obvious to me that Alice
came in after the murder.

26:29.296 --> 26:30.607
I spoke with her, she said she found it

26:30.631 --> 26:32.466
on the floor when she came in.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.052
Karen must've, must've dropped
it during the struggle.

26:35.260 --> 26:38.347
Mr. Sparges, how did Alice
know it was Karen's veil?

26:39.264 --> 26:41.975
They're all alike, they all
come from the same store.

26:42.184 --> 26:44.311
Alice never said it was Karen's veil.

26:44.520 --> 26:47.439
Everyone just assumed it
was, and the name is Spages.

26:47.648 --> 26:48.833
According to your sister-in-law,

26:48.857 --> 26:49.959
Alice said it was Karen's veil.

26:49.983 --> 26:52.152
She's always jumpin' to conclusions,

26:52.361 --> 26:54.154
especially where Alice is concerned.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.840
Well, your wife didn't disagree with her.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.200
My wife's been under
a little strain lately.

26:58.408 --> 27:00.288
Does your sister-in-law
dislike your daughter?

27:00.327 --> 27:01.578
It's probably more accurate

27:01.787 --> 27:03.163
to say she doesn't like me.

27:03.372 --> 27:06.166
Come on, you really think
she dislikes you enough to,

27:06.375 --> 27:08.127
implicate your daughter in a murder?

27:12.381 --> 27:13.882
I don't like where this is leading.

27:16.844 --> 27:18.724
You, you can just forget
about talking to Alice.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.228
I spoke to the principal.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.514
She's made a repeated request

27:28.689 --> 27:30.941
that the kid see a psychiatrist,

27:31.150 --> 27:34.361
and for some reason, the
requests have been ignored.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.738
Here, here's the records,
see for yourself.

27:42.870 --> 27:43.787
This kid's nuts!

28:02.681 --> 28:03.891
St. Michael's Rectory.

28:04.099 --> 28:04.909
Father Tom, please.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.536
I'm sorry, he's having lunch right now.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.496
Well, he's expecting
my call, it's very important.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.880
I'm sorry, but Father don't like

28:10.022 --> 28:11.607
to be disturbed at mealtimes.

28:11.815 --> 28:14.067
Tell him it's Dominic Spages.

28:14.276 --> 28:15.295
Well, if you leave your number,

28:15.319 --> 28:16.612
I'll have him call you back.

28:16.820 --> 28:17.571
Look, dammit...

28:17.779 --> 28:20.407
Don't raise your voice to me!

28:20.616 --> 28:23.285
I don't care who it is, I'm
just following the rules.

28:24.578 --> 28:27.414
Look, it's very important
I speak to Father Tom!

28:27.623 --> 28:28.423
Well, if I gave in

28:28.582 --> 28:30.125
every time someone told me that,

28:30.334 --> 28:32.836
he'd never eat a meal
without interruption.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.630
That's okay, Mrs. Tredoni.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.508
I'm sorry, Dom, I-l told
her to put you through

28:38.717 --> 28:41.053
when you called, but
I, I guess she forgot.

28:41.261 --> 28:42.262
Where are you?

28:42.471 --> 28:43.722
I'm at the police station.

28:43.931 --> 28:46.099
Did they mention
anything about the school?

28:46.308 --> 28:47.684
No, what about the school?

28:47.893 --> 28:50.812
Well, they came and
took Alice's records away.

28:51.021 --> 28:52.522
I, I couldn't stop 'em.

28:52.731 --> 28:53.958
You know, I don't believe those bastards.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.418
Do you know what they're trying to do?

28:55.442 --> 28:58.195
Now take it easy, I know
Brennan, he's not that kinda guy!

28:58.403 --> 29:01.156
Yeah, well, now he
wants to talk to Alice.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.009
I wanna talk to you
alone for a few minutes.

29:03.033 --> 29:05.393
I've got some things to tell
ya, and I haven't had a chance.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.452
I'll be going out for a
couple of hours, Mrs. Tredoni.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.753
Are you coming home for supper, Father?

29:14.962 --> 29:17.422
I'.

29:17.631 --> 29:20.175
I knew that was going to happen,
and that is precisely why

29:20.384 --> 29:22.761
I don't like to interrupt
him at mealtimes.

29:22.970 --> 29:26.598
There's a good reason for everyone.

30:02.759 --> 30:04.553
Alice, put that knife down.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.097
That's too heavy, be careful!

30:11.101 --> 30:11.977
What did I tell you?

30:12.185 --> 30:13.345
Don't hit me, don't hit me,

30:13.478 --> 30:14.718
don't hit me, I didn't mean it!

30:14.855 --> 30:16.523
I'm not going to hit you!

30:16.732 --> 30:17.959
Stay still, when have I ever hit you?

30:17.983 --> 30:19.383
What you need is a few good smacks!

30:19.568 --> 30:20.608
You liar, you were, too!

30:20.694 --> 30:24.031
Alice don't move, you're
walking on the glass.

30:24.239 --> 30:24.906
Don't move!

30:25.115 --> 30:27.117
She called me a liar,
now I am going to hit her!

30:27.326 --> 30:29.036
Annie, get the dustpan!

30:29.244 --> 30:31.872
You see, she was gonna
hit me, it was an accident!

30:32.080 --> 30:33.665
Stay still before you cut yourself.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.917
Look at this mess, I
just finished cleaning.

30:36.126 --> 30:38.086
I told her to be careful,
she never listens to me!

30:38.170 --> 30:39.588
It was an accident, Annie!

30:39.796 --> 30:42.132
She didn't mean it, tell
your aunt you didn't mean it.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.633
It's always an accident...

30:43.842 --> 30:45.844
She hates me, I didn't do it on purpose!

30:46.053 --> 30:47.253
I told her it was too heavy,

30:47.304 --> 30:49.056
and she goes right ahead
and does it anyway.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.350
This is why she should be back in school!

30:51.558 --> 30:54.102
I'm not going back to
school, I'm never going back!

30:54.311 --> 30:55.771
I wanna stay with you!

30:55.979 --> 30:57.272
You belong in school!

30:57.481 --> 30:59.316
Your mother doesn't
need you here, I'm here!

30:59.524 --> 31:00.650
Does too, she does too!

31:01.777 --> 31:03.236
I'm never going back, I won't go!

31:03.445 --> 31:05.322
Annie, why must you keep insisting

31:05.530 --> 31:06.615
on this school business?

31:06.823 --> 31:08.217
With all the trouble she's been in,

31:08.241 --> 31:09.761
she can't afford to miss a single day.

31:09.910 --> 31:10.869
What trouble?

31:11.078 --> 31:12.120
I spoke to Father Tom,

31:12.329 --> 31:14.081
and we agreed that Monday is soon enough.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.208
Not Monday, Mommy, please!

31:16.416 --> 31:17.751
Have it your way, Catherine,

31:17.959 --> 31:19.711
but the child belongs in school!

31:19.920 --> 31:22.506
This is my house, you
won't be here forever!

31:22.714 --> 31:24.091
I can't wait till you're gone!

31:24.299 --> 31:26.426
I forbid you to talk
to your aunt that way!

31:26.635 --> 31:27.719
She makes me so nervous,

31:27.928 --> 31:29.721
I do everything wrong when she's around!

31:29.930 --> 31:32.224
But you don't mean what you're saying!

31:32.432 --> 31:33.850
Aunt Annie loves you.

31:34.059 --> 31:36.395
She only does things for your own good!

31:36.603 --> 31:38.831
If you'd listen to her, you
wouldn't have dropped the milk.

31:38.855 --> 31:40.065
Why is she always right?

31:40.273 --> 31:41.024
Catherine!

31:41.233 --> 31:42.609
You always take her side!

31:42.818 --> 31:44.027
That's enough.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.530
Aunt Annie is very
generous to stay with us,

31:46.738 --> 31:49.533
and I don't wanna hear any
more about not going to school.

31:51.118 --> 31:54.204
I know that you miss Karen, so do I,

31:55.455 --> 31:58.208
but we both have to get
back to our usual lives.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.417
Don't you need me here?

31:59.584 --> 32:03.213
Of course I need you,
and you can help me,

32:03.422 --> 32:05.173
but you can't stay out of school!

32:07.342 --> 32:10.137
Would you take the rent check
down to Mr. Alphoso for me?

32:17.519 --> 32:20.313
Don't take too long, love,
your daddy will be here soon.

32:22.357 --> 32:23.150
Move over!

32:27.654 --> 32:30.490
Alice,

32:33.452 --> 32:37.622
thank you.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.626
Did you find the cross?

32:41.835 --> 32:44.296
No, I'm sure it was lost at the church.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.923
Well, Alice doesn't have it.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.292
I've been through her things.

32:48.341 --> 32:50.260
Annie, why did you do that?

32:50.469 --> 32:52.804
I told you I would ask her,
why don't you trust her?

32:53.013 --> 32:55.765
I know how important
that cross is to you, Kate.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.895
I think Alice knows where it is.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.079
I know you're there, Alice.

33:19.539 --> 33:20.332
You can come in.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.968
I won't bite you.

33:33.929 --> 33:37.682
How did you know it was me?

33:42.395 --> 33:43.563
I have the rent check.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.652
I was gonna slide it under the door.

33:52.531 --> 33:53.949
Where do you want me to put it?

33:55.909 --> 33:58.203
There's so much junk
around this filthy place!

33:58.411 --> 34:02.624
I bet you never clean it.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.709
It smells like cat's piss.

34:06.670 --> 34:09.797
My aunt says you should be
reported to the Board of Health.

34:13.592 --> 34:14.928
What's the matter, fatty?

34:16.929 --> 34:17.722
Stuck in a chair?

34:20.350 --> 34:22.018
You don't like your aunt, do you?

34:22.226 --> 34:23.061
I don't like you.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.356
You know why you don't like us?

34:26.565 --> 34:29.568
Your aunt and I are two
very perceptive people.

34:29.775 --> 34:31.987
We know what you did at the church.

34:32.195 --> 34:36.283
I can't wait to tell your
father all I know about you.

34:36.491 --> 34:37.826
What the hell do you know?

34:38.034 --> 34:41.705
Come on, the check!

34:51.505 --> 34:53.507
Dammit, look what you've
done to this check!

34:53.717 --> 34:55.092
<i>_</i> Let me go!

34:55.302 --> 34:57.512
Where are you going?

34:58.597 --> 35:02.058
You're not in a rush, are you?

35:02.267 --> 35:03.852
I know what you have downstairs.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.812
You've been snooping through my things!

35:06.021 --> 35:09.524
Your things, they're not your things!

35:10.817 --> 35:12.986
Karen will come for them.

35:13.945 --> 35:18.074
The dead have ways, the
dead don't rest easy.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.953
You better let me out.

35:22.162 --> 35:23.371
I'll scream.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.540
I'll scream and my mother
will call the police!

35:25.749 --> 35:28.668
The police were already here today,

35:28.877 --> 35:31.504
and if they come back,
I'll take 'em downstairs.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.759
You can't if my daddy's here!

35:38.386 --> 35:39.846
I'll kill your cat!

35:40.055 --> 35:43.141
You pushed up against me once
before, you disgusting slob!

35:43.350 --> 35:46.519
You'll never do that again!

35:47.854 --> 35:49.254
You killed him, you killed my cat!

35:51.107 --> 35:52.827
You killed my baby,
Alice, you little bitch!

35:55.111 --> 35:56.905
I'll get even with you!

35:58.448 --> 35:59.991
If things were so bad at school,

36:00.200 --> 36:02.327
Catherine should've
been the first to know.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.347
I don't understand why
you let it go on so long!

36:04.371 --> 36:06.790
It wasn't that serious until recently.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.278
Anyway, they weren't really sure

36:08.458 --> 36:10.877
exactly what should be blamed on Alice.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.630
She has a knack of making
things look like accidents.

36:19.469 --> 36:20.789
Thought I could handle it myself,

36:20.845 --> 36:22.639
I used to talk a lot with her,

36:22.847 --> 36:25.600
but lately, she's set up a barrier.

38:39.734 --> 38:42.028
Alice!

38:49.661 --> 38:50.870
Annie, Annie!

38:55.583 --> 38:59.504
No, Alice!

38:59.712 --> 39:01.631
What's going on here, Alice?

39:03.341 --> 39:07.136
Alice, Alice is killing Annie!

39:07.345 --> 39:08.471
Annie, Annie!

39:25.071 --> 39:27.031
Someone, help me please!

39:29.033 --> 39:32.245
Help me!

39:32.453 --> 39:35.081
Help me, please, someone help me!

39:37.792 --> 39:38.585
Tom, Tom!

39:39.836 --> 39:41.337
All right, what happened?

39:41.546 --> 39:43.172
Someone attacked her in the hall!

39:46.801 --> 39:49.929
All right, okay, I got you.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.115
Did somebody call the police?

39:51.139 --> 39:52.056
I don't know!

39:52.265 --> 39:56.978
Where's Jim, where's Jim, Jim!

39:58.563 --> 40:01.733
Tell the police I'm taking
her to St. Michael's Hospital.

40:01.941 --> 40:05.278
Dom, find Alice, make sure you find her.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.991
I didn't steal it, I
was saving it for you,

41:25.108 --> 41:26.901
Karen, you can have it!

41:28.987 --> 41:30.405
On, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

41:30.613 --> 41:32.073
It's all right, baby, it's okay.

41:32.281 --> 41:33.908
It's all right.

41:34.117 --> 41:35.702
I saw Karen!

41:35.910 --> 41:37.453
<i>I</i> will!

41:37.662 --> 41:39.872
I saw Karen!

41:40.081 --> 41:41.082
I know how you feel...

41:41.290 --> 41:43.084
Daddy, I never remembered to tell...

41:43.292 --> 41:46.421
I know you didn't, I know!

41:48.214 --> 41:51.592
I know it was Karen, Daddy,

41:51.801 --> 41:54.178
'cause she wants her doll.

42:08.317 --> 42:12.196
<i>Nurse On PM Dr. Shino,
383, Dr. sumo, 333.</i>

42:19.662 --> 42:24.625
Okay, bye.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.755
She all right?

42:28.963 --> 42:29.672
Yes.

42:31.674 --> 42:32.884
She's just so frightened.

42:39.098 --> 42:40.266
Tom, what am I gonna do?

42:44.020 --> 42:45.688
Everything's happening so fast.

42:47.523 --> 42:50.735
Dom said whoever did it
frightened her half to death.

42:50.943 --> 42:51.861
Where was she?

42:52.070 --> 42:53.237
She was in the basement.

42:56.908 --> 42:57.909
Who's doing this to me?

42:58.117 --> 42:59.660
Haven't I had enough?

42:59.869 --> 43:02.747
Alphonso told the police it was Alice.

43:02.955 --> 43:04.332
They're on their way here.

43:04.540 --> 43:05.792
Did he see her?

43:06.000 --> 43:07.376
Of course not, how could he?

43:08.377 --> 43:11.130
He's only repeating what
he heard Annie scream.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.508
Don't you see, people believe
what they wanna believe!

43:13.716 --> 43:14.526
Well, what's important is

43:14.550 --> 43:15.778
what the police will think about this.

43:15.802 --> 43:17.512
Well, they don't know her!

43:17.720 --> 43:19.639
No one knows her like I do.

43:19.847 --> 43:22.475
What if Annie tells 'em what she told me?

43:22.683 --> 43:24.811
Well, you'll just have to
wait and see what happens.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.521
What are you saying?

43:26.729 --> 43:29.732
She was hysterical, she
didn't even know me!

43:29.941 --> 43:31.609
Annie would never say something like that

43:31.818 --> 43:33.277
if she were herself!

43:33.486 --> 43:35.196
Catherine, there's Detective Spina.

43:38.491 --> 43:39.784
Tom, talk to him.

43:39.992 --> 43:40.752
Let me go to Annie,

43:40.827 --> 43:43.162
just give me a minute, please, please!

43:43.371 --> 43:44.080
Catherine!

44:18.906 --> 44:19.699
Annie?

44:23.703 --> 44:24.495
Annie?

44:33.254 --> 44:34.547
Annie, I wanna talk to you.

44:36.215 --> 44:37.550
I wanna talk to you, Annie.

44:40.011 --> 44:41.554
I know you won't do this to me.

44:44.182 --> 44:46.142
You didn't realize what you were saying.

44:47.602 --> 44:49.228
How could you, you were so upset!

44:50.688 --> 44:51.939
Don't turn away like that.

44:53.649 --> 44:55.818
What is the matter with you?

44:57.528 --> 44:59.572
Have you gone crazy?

44:59.780 --> 45:01.199
Am I some kind of stranger?

45:03.784 --> 45:05.328
Please, Annie, please!

45:06.871 --> 45:09.498
I will never forgive you
if you do this to me!

45:10.833 --> 45:12.710
Never, never!

45:20.176 --> 45:22.345
Excuse me, Father,
can I get through here?

45:24.305 --> 45:25.598
How are you, Mrs. Lorenze?

45:27.183 --> 45:28.267
I won't keep you long.

45:30.102 --> 45:33.356
You know I have to talk to you.

45:33.564 --> 45:35.775
I want you to tell me
everything that happened.

45:36.776 --> 45:39.403
Where's Jim, I want Jimmy!

45:39.612 --> 45:42.406
Leave her alone, I'm her sister.

45:43.449 --> 45:45.785
I was there, and I can tell
you anything you wanna know.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.703
I'm sure you can, Mrs. Spages,

45:47.912 --> 45:48.871
and I'm very interested

45:49.080 --> 45:50.706
in hearing everything you have to say,

45:50.915 --> 45:52.142
but right now, I wanna be alone

45:52.166 --> 45:54.085
with your sister for a while.

45:54.293 --> 45:55.773
Father, you think you and Mrs. Spages

45:55.962 --> 45:57.380
could leave the room for a minute?

45:59.715 --> 46:01.175
I'll be right with you.

46:01.384 --> 46:02.343
Annie?

46:02.551 --> 46:03.552
Jimmy!

46:04.845 --> 46:06.639
Annie?

46:06.847 --> 46:10.309
Hey, Annie!

46:10.518 --> 46:11.435
What happened?

46:11.644 --> 46:16.524
Jim, Jimmy!

46:16.899 --> 46:18.943
Annie, I was so worried!

46:19.151 --> 46:21.088
Somebody called and said
somebody tried to kill you!

46:21.112 --> 46:24.073
They cut through me, it was awful!

46:24.282 --> 46:29.120
She stabbed and stabbed my legs!

46:29.620 --> 46:31.497
Who, Annie, who?

46:31.706 --> 46:33.124
Annie, don't!

46:33.332 --> 46:35.376
She tried to kill me!

46:35.584 --> 46:40.464
My God, I don't believe
it, I don't believe it!

46:40.756 --> 46:41.757
Annie, shut up!

46:41.966 --> 46:43.759
Kate, for Christ's sake, let her talk!

46:44.760 --> 46:46.137
All right, what's going on here?

46:46.345 --> 46:50.433
She's like my own, I love her, Catherine!

46:50.641 --> 46:52.059
You hate her!

46:52.268 --> 46:54.854
You should've knew I was
pregnant when I got married!

46:55.062 --> 46:56.939
That's not true!

46:57.148 --> 46:58.441
I love Alice!

46:59.317 --> 47:02.862
May God strike me dead if I'm lying!

47:03.070 --> 47:04.864
Honey, don't, don't!

47:05.072 --> 47:07.366
Do you realize what you're saying?

47:07.575 --> 47:12.455
It was Alice <i>,</i> it was Alice!

47:13.581 --> 47:14.832
Liar!

47:15.750 --> 47:18.169
Liar, you're all liars!

47:18.377 --> 47:21.630
I'm not lying, I'm not lying!

47:23.883 --> 47:25.760
You wanna believe it was her!

47:27.511 --> 47:28.929
Why not Angela?

47:29.138 --> 47:30.306
She wasn't in the church!

47:31.432 --> 47:35.644
See, you see!

47:35.853 --> 47:38.731
Don't you see what they're trying to do?

47:38.939 --> 47:40.358
This is Detective Mike Spina.

47:41.400 --> 47:44.028
I wanna be connected with the
Paterson Police Department.

48:33.452 --> 48:34.332
Now remember, Alice,

48:34.453 --> 48:35.733
I want you say no to every card.

48:37.081 --> 48:38.541
I want you to lie.

48:40.501 --> 48:41.293
Is it the six?

48:42.837 --> 48:44.839
No.

48:45.047 --> 48:45.923
Four?

48:46.132 --> 48:47.216
No.

48:47.425 --> 48:50.678
That was the six, wasn't it?

48:50.886 --> 48:51.595
Yes.

48:51.804 --> 48:53.305
Yes, now we know it's working.

48:54.348 --> 48:56.934
Now let's get to these
questions, shall we, Alice?

48:57.143 --> 48:58.394
Now, do you intend

48:58.602 --> 49:00.438
to answer truthfully to every question?

49:04.442 --> 49:06.068
Please, answer yes or no.

49:07.653 --> 49:08.446
Yes.

49:10.865 --> 49:13.325
Do you know for sure
who stabbed your aunt?

49:13.534 --> 49:15.536
No.

49:15.744 --> 49:17.121
Did you stab you aunt?

49:17.329 --> 49:18.038
No.

49:19.790 --> 49:21.667
During your entire life,

49:21.876 --> 49:24.670
did you deliberately hurt
someone who trusted you?

49:28.215 --> 49:29.175
During your entire life,

49:29.300 --> 49:32.094
did you deliberately hurt
someone who trusted you?

49:32.303 --> 49:33.613
I put Debbie's coat in the toilet,

49:33.637 --> 49:35.431
if that's what you mean, but I didn't lie!

49:35.639 --> 49:37.057
I told the sister I did it.

49:37.266 --> 49:40.769
Please, Alice, answer yes or no.

49:42.271 --> 49:43.063
Yes.

49:44.690 --> 49:47.067
In the suitcase found in the basement

49:47.276 --> 49:50.070
were a white dress and
a mask, are they yours?

49:50.279 --> 49:51.489
Yes.

49:51.697 --> 49:53.657
Are you deliberately
withholding any information

49:53.699 --> 49:55.576
regarding the attack on your aunt?

49:55.784 --> 49:58.746
No.

49:58.954 --> 50:00.706
Do you know who stabbed your aunt?

50:00.915 --> 50:02.875
<i>'</i> No!

50:03.083 --> 50:04.877
Do you know who stabbed your aunt?

50:07.129 --> 50:09.256
Yes, it was Karen, I
told 'em it was Karen,

50:09.465 --> 50:10.508
but no one believed me!

50:11.383 --> 50:12.176
It was Karen!

50:13.761 --> 50:15.554
All right, Alice, thank you.

50:16.764 --> 50:17.640
They're finished.

50:17.848 --> 50:19.528
The matron will take
you back to my office,

50:19.600 --> 50:21.477
and I'll give you the test results there.

50:21.685 --> 50:22.937
What about Alice?

50:23.145 --> 50:24.355
I'll bring her back with me.

50:26.857 --> 50:28.984
Will you give me Alice's coat?

50:29.193 --> 50:30.003
What do you need that for?

50:30.027 --> 50:31.529
You'll get it back.

50:33.197 --> 50:33.989
Thank you.

51:06.730 --> 51:07.523
Well?

51:08.983 --> 51:10.317
I don't know what to tell ya!

51:11.485 --> 51:14.446
Well, for Christ's sake,
did she fail or didn't she?

51:14.655 --> 51:16.448
Technically, I guess she failed.

51:16.657 --> 51:18.492
What do you mean, technically?

51:18.701 --> 51:20.541
I asked her if she knew
who stabbed her aunt.

51:20.661 --> 51:24.164
She lied, she said no,
so I asked her again.

51:24.373 --> 51:25.624
She said it was her sister.

51:25.833 --> 51:27.209
But her sister's dead!

51:27.418 --> 51:29.962
Yeah, but she wasn't lying,
so what do you want from me?

51:30.170 --> 51:31.922
It's obvious the kid is off the wall!

51:35.968 --> 51:38.554
I wanna book her, if not for the murder,

51:38.762 --> 51:40.514
for the stabbing of her aunt.

51:40.723 --> 51:43.642
We'll let the psychiatrist
give us some answers.

51:43.851 --> 51:45.185
She is a weird little girl.

51:46.270 --> 51:47.438
Did you notice her tits?

51:48.564 --> 51:49.916
When I went to put the tube around her,

51:49.940 --> 51:52.526
she looked up at me like she
wanted me to feel her up.

51:56.071 --> 51:58.115
Hey, the little bitch
is dumpin' your machine!

51:58.324 --> 52:01.285
' Hey, hey, hey, hey, stop that!

52:01.452 --> 52:03.203
Damn you, stop that!

52:31.732 --> 52:32.983
In the name of the Father,

52:33.192 --> 52:35.235
and the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.030
Bless us, Lord, for these, thy gifts,

52:38.238 --> 52:40.115
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty

52:40.324 --> 52:41.909
through Christ, our Lord, Amen.

52:42.117 --> 52:42.927
In the name of the Father,

52:42.951 --> 52:44.995
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.752
Why couldn't I stay upstairs?

52:51.960 --> 52:53.504
You know I'm not feeling well!

52:53.712 --> 52:55.631
Because I can't be running up and down.

52:57.007 --> 52:59.718
And, and tell the children to stay out!

52:59.927 --> 53:01.095
What children?

53:01.303 --> 53:03.305
You know there's no children in the house!

53:04.973 --> 53:07.685
You want me to feed you, or
you can manage by yourself?

53:09.061 --> 53:10.562
I'm not dead yet!

53:10.771 --> 53:13.357
Then eat!

53:16.193 --> 53:17.945
Where's my wine?

53:18.153 --> 53:20.322
I have only two hands, Monsignor.

53:26.829 --> 53:28.622
Father's not coming to lunch.

53:35.879 --> 53:38.465
You, sure you don't wanna
come to the shelter with us'?

53:38.674 --> 53:40.843
No, I don't think that'd be a good idea.

53:41.051 --> 53:42.636
She only needs the two of you now.

53:44.138 --> 53:46.598
Look, come inside, I'll get
you the information you want.

53:50.894 --> 53:52.187
That must be Tom now!

53:54.398 --> 53:56.358
And everything is ice cold!

53:56.567 --> 53:59.111
Cold, no, tell him not to worry.

53:59.319 --> 54:00.529
She's a good woman.

54:00.738 --> 54:01.898
What are you talking about?

54:01.947 --> 54:03.407
You don't make sense!

54:08.203 --> 54:09.413
You didn't each your lunch.

54:09.621 --> 54:10.998
I want my cake now!

54:14.042 --> 54:14.835
I'll help you.

54:21.049 --> 54:23.093
Now this is only the
order sheet for the coats.

54:23.302 --> 54:24.803
I'll, I'll call the Mother Superior

54:25.012 --> 54:25.864
and tell her you're on your way.

54:25.888 --> 54:27.568
She has the complete
lists of all the names

54:27.681 --> 54:31.393
and addresses of those who purchased one.

54:31.602 --> 54:33.645
Angela has one, doesn't she?

54:33.854 --> 54:37.274
Why Angela, what are you groping for?

54:37.483 --> 54:40.611
Well, Alice said she saw
Karen wear those coats.

54:40.819 --> 54:43.197
It's obvious she saw
someone, maybe it was Angela.

54:44.281 --> 54:45.721
You realize you're doing to Angela

54:45.908 --> 54:48.619
what you think Annie is doing to Alice.

54:49.620 --> 54:50.746
Well, if it wasn't her,

54:50.954 --> 54:52.581
whoever it was might be on this list.

54:57.795 --> 55:00.297
Dom,

55:02.633 --> 55:04.134
if this lead doesn't work out,

55:04.343 --> 55:06.470
how long will you stay
around and play detective?

55:07.638 --> 55:08.972
I don't know, Tom.

55:09.181 --> 55:11.099
I have to stay until the killer is found.

55:12.267 --> 55:13.185
What about Julia?

55:14.978 --> 55:17.397
I can't answer that right now.

55:19.566 --> 55:21.566
Hey, thanks for the car,
I'll drop it off tomorrow.

55:33.580 --> 55:37.709
Subject Alice Spages,
12 years, one month.

55:37.918 --> 55:39.294
Normal physical development.

55:41.922 --> 55:43.882
Subject represses hostilities

55:44.091 --> 55:46.093
toward her mother and estranged father.

55:55.310 --> 55:56.186
What do ya want?

55:56.395 --> 55:58.939
Strong indications of
a schizoid personality.

56:00.023 --> 56:03.068
Subject is capable of
extremely violent action.

56:04.611 --> 56:05.404
Come in!

56:06.530 --> 56:08.782
Dr. Whitman, Mr. And
Mrs. Spages are here.

56:08.991 --> 56:09.700
Yes.

56:14.538 --> 56:15.330
Sit down.

56:18.500 --> 56:21.128
I, I had a session
with Alice this morning,

56:21.336 --> 56:22.939
and I thought perhaps I should talk to you

56:22.963 --> 56:23.755
before you see her.

56:23.964 --> 56:25.424
Is anything wrong?

56:25.632 --> 56:28.886
Well, it's far too soon
to be making judgments.

56:29.094 --> 56:30.971
As understaffed as we are here,

56:32.139 --> 56:34.600
we try to give the children as
much time as they would have

56:34.808 --> 56:37.185
in a private practice.

56:37.394 --> 56:40.439
I've diagnosed hundreds of
cases exactly like Alice,

56:40.647 --> 56:42.900
but to eliminate any possibility of error,

56:43.942 --> 56:47.154
one tries to

56:47.362 --> 56:51.199
suspend judgment until one can observe

56:51.408 --> 56:52.784
as much as you possibly can.

56:54.077 --> 56:56.663
Dr. Whitman, I,
I think you should know

56:56.872 --> 56:59.291
that my attorney is doing
everything he possibly can

56:59.499 --> 57:01.418
to get Alice back home with her mother.

57:01.627 --> 57:04.504
That's exactly what I
wanted to warn you against.

57:04.713 --> 57:06.313
I don't think you should encourage Alice

57:06.340 --> 57:08.800
to believe that she would
be coming home soon.

57:09.009 --> 57:10.552
Perhaps being at home with her mother

57:10.761 --> 57:11.929
is not the best thing.

57:12.137 --> 57:13.180
What does that mean?

57:13.388 --> 57:15.599
Be prepared for hostility from Alice.

57:16.850 --> 57:18.769
It's only natural that she would think

57:18.977 --> 57:21.772
that you were responsible
for her predicament.

57:21.980 --> 57:23.774
You might say that, like all of us,

57:23.982 --> 57:25.817
she blames others for her troubles.

57:26.026 --> 57:28.487
She is here because of
a lot of other people.

57:28.695 --> 57:30.989
Alice has many deep-seeded problems.

57:31.198 --> 57:33.158
But she is not a murderer.

57:33.367 --> 57:35.243
Alice needs psychological help.

57:37.079 --> 57:39.414
Well, in that case, I assume
you would have no objection

57:39.623 --> 57:41.917
to our using our own psychiatrist.

57:42.125 --> 57:43.669
Not at all.

57:45.963 --> 57:46.964
Would you take the Spages

57:47.172 --> 57:48.966
down to the playground please, Phyllis?

57:52.678 --> 57:54.638
Let me remind you to be candid

57:54.846 --> 57:57.140
about the issue of coming home.

57:57.349 --> 58:00.268
Be assured, she will get the
best possible treatment here.

58:02.020 --> 58:03.063
Mrs. Spages,

58:04.106 --> 58:05.732
why did Alice conceal from you

58:05.941 --> 58:07.776
the fact that she's begun menstruating?

58:10.988 --> 58:14.491
Parents so often don't know their children

58:14.700 --> 58:15.784
as well as they presume.

58:35.262 --> 58:36.304
Ally,

58:37.556 --> 58:39.141
how you doin', honey?

58:39.349 --> 58:40.726
Fine.

58:40.934 --> 58:42.894
Did you sleep all right?

58:43.103 --> 58:45.439
How's your room?

58:45.647 --> 58:46.666
Why'd you bring the suitcase?

58:46.690 --> 58:47.858
Aren't you taking me home?

58:49.860 --> 58:51.820
Not until the doctor says you're ready.

58:53.155 --> 58:56.700
We met Dr. Whitman,
what did you think of her?

59:00.328 --> 59:03.123
She said you had a nice
talk, what'd you talk about?

59:03.331 --> 59:04.124
A lot of things.

59:05.208 --> 59:06.543
Like what, Ally?

59:06.752 --> 59:09.004
I told her Aunt Annie
lies and that you let her.

59:09.212 --> 59:10.047
That's not true!

59:10.255 --> 59:13.050
You're just like Aunt
Annie and that slob Alphonso.

59:13.258 --> 59:14.676
You wanna keep me here.

59:14.885 --> 59:17.888
Alice, now you're hurting your mother.

59:18.096 --> 59:19.449
I don't want you to talk like that.

59:19.473 --> 59:22.768
Now, listen, I don't want you to worry.

59:22.976 --> 59:24.256
I'm going to find out the truth.

59:24.352 --> 59:26.813
How can you, you have
to go home to your wife!

59:27.022 --> 59:28.648
Honey, I promise, I intend to stay

59:28.857 --> 59:31.401
until I find out who was
in the hall with your aunt!

59:31.610 --> 59:34.905
Come on.

59:35.113 --> 59:36.740
I don't wanna stay here.

59:36.948 --> 59:38.158
Why can't I go home?

59:38.366 --> 59:39.886
You heard the judge, you have to stay

59:40.077 --> 59:42.037
until the medical tests are completed.

59:42.245 --> 59:44.706
Medical tests, she's a psychiatrist.

59:44.915 --> 59:46.995
Everyone thinks I'm crazy
'cause I said it was Karen,

59:47.167 --> 59:48.877
and you don't believe me either!

59:50.378 --> 59:51.713
Can you understand that there

59:51.922 --> 59:53.882
are two different reasons why you're here?

59:55.842 --> 59:57.844
One is because you were in the basement

59:58.053 --> 59:59.072
when your aunt was attacked.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:00.263
But I didn't do it!

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:02.140
I know you didn't do it,

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:03.892
and I'm going to find out who did.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:06.019
I saw Karen!

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:08.688
Look, many times we think we see things,

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:10.816
and later we realize we were wrong,

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:15.320
but sometimes, it's
important to find out why.

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:16.631
Dr. Whitman wants you to sign

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:18.740
a release form for medication.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.325
What does she need that for?

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:23.203
Stay here, I'll see what it's about.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.144
Would you like to show me your room

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:32.420
and I can help you put your things away?

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:33.421
I don't want to.

01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:38.760
I packed your heavy robe

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.595
just in case.
I don't need it.

01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:50.438
I didn't put you here, Alice!

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:51.773
What's wrong with you?

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:55.110
Why won't you talk to me, I'm your mother!

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:56.570
I have nothing to talk about.

01:00:56.778 --> 01:00:59.281
Well, you had plenty
to say to Dr. Whitman!

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.533
Why didn't you tell me
you had your period?

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:03.618
Why doesn't everybody
just leave me alone?

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:05.203
Leave you alone?

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:06.652
Don't you know that I love you,

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:08.915
you're on my mind every minute?

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:10.834
Take this, you know it's not mine.

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:14.004
I thought maybe you might want it now.

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:16.464
Well, I don't, I don't
play with dolls anymore.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:20.802
I'm sorry, I guess I just
keep forgetting how old you are.

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:25.140
I'll be back tomorrow.

01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:27.851
Is there anything you want from home?

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:30.020
No, just leave me alone.

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:31.897
Don't take this out on me, Alice.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:34.232
I am trying-

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:42.908
- Mommy, no, don't go!

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.819
Hey, why can't you see that
it makes just as much sense

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.345
that Angela could be guilty?

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.804
Dom, you're wrong.

01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:06.890
You're looking for
something that isn't there.

01:02:07.766 --> 01:02:09.351
Her name's on the coat list.

01:02:20.195 --> 01:02:24.532
Look how small Karen's coat is.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:27.577
It's a size seven, Angela's
would be at least a 14,

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.498
and how could Alice
confuse the two of them?

01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:32.582
It was dark.

01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:34.960
She was so scared, she
didn't even recognize me.

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:37.796
Dom, I don't know.

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:39.673
Hey, what do you mean, you don't know?

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:42.092
You said yourself no one
knew where Angela was.

01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:50.934
Hello?

01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:54.271
Hello?

01:02:59.067 --> 01:03:00.068
I think it was Annie.

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:02.436
What does she expect me to do,

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:04.698
forgive her and pretend
nothing has happened?

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:07.728
I think you should talk to her.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:10.453
Well, I will when
she admits that she lied.

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:12.747
Why antagonize her,
it can only hurt Alice.

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:21.715
I can't.

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:22.882
Sure, you can.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:33.143
I can't, I just can't deal with it.

01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:39.065
Hello, Ann?

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:44.821
She hung up.

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:54.289
I'm sorry.

01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:01.212
I shouldn't have asked you to.

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:06.509
We'll do it without her.

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:11.389
I'll make everything all right.

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:12.307
Can you?

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:14.976
Can you?

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:25.088
Hello?

01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:27.340
Hello, Catherine, it's Julia.

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:29.777
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:31.094
I've been trying to find Dom.

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:32.303
Is he there?

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:33.263
Yes, he's here.

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:35.432
It's your wife.

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:42.313
Julia, what's wrong?

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:44.065
I thought you were going to call?

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.025
Is everything all right?

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:47.110
How can it be?

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:48.254
Why are you so annoyed?

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:50.071
I'm sorry, I, I didn't mean to snap.

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:52.907
What's the matter?

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:55.160
Nothing, it's just
that I'm kind of lonely.

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:58.705
Look, I, I can't talk right now, I'll,

01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:00.473
I'll call you there tonight, all right?

01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:01.778
Are you sure nothing is wrong?

01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:04.752
I miss you, can't wait till you get back.

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:06.671
Do you love me?

01:06:08.423 --> 01:06:09.966
Do you love me?

01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:10.925
Yes, I love you.

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:14.512
I'll call you there tonight.

01:06:15.763 --> 01:06:17.557
Bye.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:23.980
Alice was right.

01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:25.565
Don't play detective, go home.

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:36.326
Dom?

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:45.210
I wanted it as much as you did.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:48.338
It was nice to be held.

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:54.969
You know you're even more beautiful now?

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:56.221
That's nice.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:06:59.974
We both are, Dom.

01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:04.062
I guess you're right.

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:17.325
Dom, don't you think you should go back?

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:19.494
It's not fair.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:22.622
I can't.

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:42.934
Mr. Spages, I was
just ringing your room.

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:44.185
You've got a call.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:45.496
Why don't you take it from here?

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.145
Thank you.

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:47.063
You bet.

01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:48.648
Hello?

01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:50.191
Dom!

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.025
Who is this?

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.403
<i>'</i> Angela.

01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:54.612
Angela, what's wrong?

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:58.491
I ran away, I'm hiding.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.594
Honey, I can't hear you, you're
gonna have to speak louder.

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:02.412
I've got Karen's cross,

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.706
and Mommy won't let me give it to you!

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:06.583
Listen, let me meet you somewhere,

01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:07.851
and we can talk about it, okay?

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:10.378
Will you tell '2

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:12.547
Now, you know better than that.

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:14.515
Has Uncle Dom ever done
anything to hurt you?

01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:16.968
No.

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:19.386
All right, I'm leaving right now.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:20.220
Where are you?

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:24.475
I'm at, I'm near the Ivanhoe Building.

01:08:24.684 --> 01:08:26.323
All right, I'll be there in 15 minutes.

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:28.622
Angela, now stop crying, honey.

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:29.926
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:10:01.823 --> 01:10:02.865
Angela, wait!

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:49.537
Angela?

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:01.377
You don't have to be afraid of me.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.665
Angela, what were you doing to me?

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:33.469
You, you can't...

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:36.639
You filthy pig, you and that whore!

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:39.892
God wants you punished!

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:48.609
We are protection against
the screams of the devil!

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:56.659
Father belongs to the church!

01:14:56.867 --> 01:14:59.912
That's mine, mine, that cross is mine!

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:09.422
It's mine, mine, mine!

01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:15.594
Mine, mine, mine, mine!

01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:19.432
Thrust into hell, Satan
and the other evil spirits

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:23.644
who roam this earth,
seeking the real souls!

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:56.654
All right, let's settle down now.

01:16:56.862 --> 01:16:58.906
Don't keep Father waiting.

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:07.081
In the pews.

01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:19.552
Hello, boys and girls.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.053
Hello, Father.

01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:24.390
Today is your last confession as a group,

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:26.078
so I want you to think very carefully

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:27.768
what you're going to say,

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:29.121
but remember, you don't have to tell me

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:30.980
everything you've done since last Sunday.

01:17:31.188 --> 01:17:32.165
After all, we don't want Sister

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:33.315
to miss her lunch.

01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:44.702
And please remember Karen in your prayers.

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:03.554
Is someone in here?

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:09.685
Bless me Father, for I have sinned.

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:13.272
We're only hearing
the children this morning.

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.566
Bless me Father, for I have sinned.

01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:17.776
Please Father, I need confession!

01:18:17.985 --> 01:18:19.195
Father, please!

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:25.242
Please hear me, Father, I'm troubled!

01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:26.619
I have time.

01:18:26.827 --> 01:18:29.622
I, I, I lost my temper.

01:18:30.623 --> 01:18:32.833
I got angry with the Monsignor, and

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:36.962
I neglected my morning prayers!

01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:37.981
This can't be the reason

01:18:38.005 --> 01:18:39.399
you wanted confession this morning.

01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:41.217
No, Father, there is something.

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.802
<i>'</i> Yes?

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:47.806
I know you, you're a good woman.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.643
It can't be as bad as you think.

01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:55.731
I, I, I lose patience with the Monsignor.

01:18:57.650 --> 01:19:01.779
Sometimes I wish Father, I can remember

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:04.823
when everyone respected him so much.

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:06.742
I understand, it's not easy

01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:08.577
to see someone you love suffer.

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:10.996
No, you don't understand!

01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:13.045
Sometimes, I think that
it would even be better

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:13.958
if God,

01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:18.754
It is a sin to think such thoughts!

01:19:18.963 --> 01:19:20.506
No, it's not a sin.

01:19:20.714 --> 01:19:22.317
You've devoted so much of yourself to us,

01:19:22.341 --> 01:19:23.985
it's only natural that you should want God

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:24.969
to spare us from pain.

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:27.179
Yes, Father.

01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:29.265
You have great faith.

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:34.061
It's because of this that
you can look forward to death

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.021
as a resolution.

01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:39.358
Yes, Father.

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:41.860
Now, there's no greater reward

01:19:42.069 --> 01:19:44.029
than to spend eternity with our Lord.

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:46.991
Yes, Father.

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:49.994
I only wish you'd come
to me sooner about this.

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:52.579
So am I, Father.

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:56.583
There's no need to
come to confession for this.

01:19:57.876 --> 01:20:00.254
When you're upset, come and see me, I,

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:02.840
I'm your confessor, but
I'm, I'm also your friend.

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:05.301
Thank you, Father.

01:21:01.106 --> 01:21:02.775
I'm sorry to bother you, Mrs. Tredoni.

01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:03.783
Father's not here.

01:21:03.817 --> 01:21:05.235
Well, I'm looking for Mr. Spages.

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:07.196
I knew he had to drop Tom's car off.

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:10.824
I didn't see him.

01:21:11.033 --> 01:21:12.433
I'm very sorry, I'm cooking supper.

01:21:12.493 --> 01:21:13.345
You'll have to excuse me.

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:14.971
Dom was supposed to
pick me up this morning,

01:21:14.995 --> 01:21:16.455
and I haven't heard from him.

01:21:16.663 --> 01:21:18.123
I thought maybe he was with Tom.

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:22.252
Well, could I wait for a little while?

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:28.258
Suit yourself.

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:37.267
Maybe he won't be back so soon.

01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:39.913
Do you think maybe there could be

01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:41.855
something wrong with the phone?

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:43.744
I tried to call several times this morning

01:21:43.941 --> 01:21:45.025
and there was no answer.

01:21:46.276 --> 01:21:47.069
I was out.

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:50.322
You can turn on the lights.

01:21:50.531 --> 01:21:52.366
There is some magazines.

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:53.450
Thank you.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.123
I made you some coffee.

01:22:41.331 --> 01:22:43.542
Thank you.

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:45.502
It's in the kitchen.

01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:05.564
Sit down.

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:15.324
This is really very nice of you.

01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:17.784
I didn't mean to put you to any trouble.

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:18.827
No trouble.

01:23:37.387 --> 01:23:38.764
Aren't you gonna have any?

01:23:41.475 --> 01:23:44.228
I make it a rule not to
have a coffee after breakfast.

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:51.777
I know this is silly of me.

01:23:51.985 --> 01:23:53.737
I really should go home.

01:23:53.946 --> 01:23:55.572
I don't know why I'm so worried, I,

01:23:56.573 --> 01:23:59.034
I just can't imagine where he could be.

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:01.036
Maybe you were afraid that God would send

01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:05.082
St. Michael to take
another of your loved ones.

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:07.251
When St. Michael took my little girl,

01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:10.963
I only thought of how cruel God was.

01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:12.339
Mrs. Tredoni, I'm sorry.

01:24:13.298 --> 01:24:14.967
I never knew you had a little girl.

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:22.558
God took her from me the
day of her First Communion.

01:24:22.766 --> 01:24:23.517
Don't you see?

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.603
He waited until then to teach me

01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:30.774
that children pay for the
sins of their parents,

01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:34.486
and then I was sent here
to look after Father,

01:24:34.695 --> 01:24:37.364
not you!

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:38.407
Mrs. Tredoni!

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:40.117
It's Tom.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:42.953
Tom?

01:24:45.872 --> 01:24:46.748
Tom?

01:24:46.957 --> 01:24:48.393
Catherine, what are you doing here?

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:49.811
I've been looking for you all afternoon.

01:24:49.835 --> 01:24:50.836
Where's Dom?

01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:53.088
There's been an accident.

01:24:53.297 --> 01:24:55.757
Dom?

01:24:55.966 --> 01:24:59.011
God, no!

01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:01.138
No!

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:21.408
The left humerus is fractured.

01:25:23.327 --> 01:25:26.913
Left clavicle is fractured.

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:30.375
Contusions and abrasions of the thorax.

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:35.172
Have you heard from his wife yet?

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:36.089
No, not yet.

01:25:48.685 --> 01:25:49.746
Did he give any indication

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:51.647
that he knew something, anything?

01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:53.690
Last time I saw him, I got him a list

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:55.942
of the families that bought school coats.

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:57.231
He was convinced that Alice

01:25:57.361 --> 01:25:59.154
had confused Karen with somebody else.

01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:04.284
Because of Annie's attitude,
he suspected his niece, Angela.

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:05.887
We never did find out where that kid was

01:26:05.911 --> 01:26:06.870
at the time of murder.

01:26:09.289 --> 01:26:09.998
Brennan, yeah.

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:11.207
You won't believe this,

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:14.211
I found a cross lodged in his throat.

01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:16.546
It had to have been worn by the killer.

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:19.549
It wasn't forced down his
throat, he bit down on it.

01:26:19.758 --> 01:26:21.927
There are teeth marks all over it.

01:26:22.135 --> 01:26:23.488
See if it matches the description

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:25.222
of the one belonging to Karen Spages.

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:15.272
The train's gonna be at
least a half an hour late.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:17.149
What'll I do about Alice?

01:27:17.357 --> 01:27:18.400
Let's go get her.

01:27:18.608 --> 01:27:19.901
There's no need to stay here.

01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:38.378
I'm not gonna tell her just yet.

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:42.340
She's been without a
father for a long time.

01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:45.969
I'm afraid to take him
away from her so soon.

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:47.822
You're wrong, I
think you should tell her.

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:50.265
I've lost control of my life, Tom!

01:27:50.474 --> 01:27:53.477
I, I can't.

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:55.020
Death does this to people.

01:27:55.228 --> 01:27:58.607
Well, haven't I had more than my share?

01:27:58.815 --> 01:28:00.734
There's no such thing
as a share, Catherine.

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:42.567
I'm frightened.

01:28:42.776 --> 01:28:44.945
Maybe I should leave her
here, at least she's safe.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.530
Don't be ridiculous, Kate.

01:28:46.738 --> 01:28:47.489
She needs you now.

01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:50.617
Police will watch you both,

01:28:50.826 --> 01:28:52.285
I promise you have nothing to fear.

01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:53.495
For how long?

01:28:53.703 --> 01:28:57.415
What happens if they
don't find the murderer?

01:28:57.624 --> 01:28:59.584
Alice is waiting.

01:29:14.724 --> 01:29:16.017
Where's Daddy?

01:29:16.977 --> 01:29:18.979
He had to go back.

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:21.147
How come?

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:24.818
Let's go home, we'll talk about it later.

01:29:26.528 --> 01:29:29.114
He didn't even say goodbye.

01:29:29.322 --> 01:29:30.866
Please don't feel that way.

01:29:31.074 --> 01:29:35.954
He kept his promise to you.

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:40.250
It's because of him you're coming home.

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:26.880
Father,

01:30:29.633 --> 01:30:30.508
her rosary!

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:06.544
Are you to be summoned again?

01:32:19.325 --> 01:32:20.452
Who's there?

01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:23.830
Who's there?

01:33:20.178 --> 01:33:22.430
Detective Unit 31 to Headquarters.

01:33:22.639 --> 01:33:24.140
Go ahead, 31.

01:33:24.349 --> 01:33:26.184
I'll be 10-15 for five minutes.

01:33:26.392 --> 01:33:28.561
10-4, 31.

01:35:01.279 --> 01:35:02.614
What were you doing in there?

01:35:02.822 --> 01:35:04.490
Just saying hello to Mr. Alphonso.

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:07.702
I'm glad you did that.

01:35:09.078 --> 01:35:12.165
That was a nice thing to do.

01:35:30.934 --> 01:35:31.726
Alice,

01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:37.482
let's stop by at Aunt
Annie's at the way to mass.

01:35:37.690 --> 01:35:38.900
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:36:58.688 --> 01:37:02.900
Hey, you little bitch!

01:39:56.699 --> 01:39:58.534
She's inside, Father Pat's watching her.

01:39:58.743 --> 01:40:00.244
- Let's go!
- Wait a minute!

01:40:00.453 --> 01:40:01.805
She's too close to Catherine and Alice.

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:03.474
If she sees you, there's
no telling what she'll do.

01:40:03.498 --> 01:40:05.791
Now, it's almost time for communion.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.240
Come with me into the sacristy.

01:40:07.376 --> 01:40:09.504
When she comes up to
receive, I know I can get her

01:40:09.712 --> 01:40:11.297
to come with Father Pat and me.

01:40:11.506 --> 01:40:12.483
What if she doesn't come...

01:40:12.507 --> 01:40:14.133
Look, I know her, she'll come!

01:40:15.134 --> 01:40:16.469
She hasn't missed.

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:18.638
I wanna have a marksman in the balcony.

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:20.014
Not in my church!

01:40:21.682 --> 01:40:26.103
I can handle her, she
wouldn't do anything to me.

01:40:26.312 --> 01:40:28.272
Okay, Father, we'll play it your way,

01:40:28.481 --> 01:40:30.125
but my men will be covering all the exits.

01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:33.861
Nothing'll happen, she'll come.

01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:35.738
Let's go, Father.

01:40:59.595 --> 01:41:00.471
Bait her.

01:42:20.134 --> 01:42:20.926
Faster!

01:42:40.321 --> 01:42:43.115
Please come with me, Mrs. Tredoni.

01:42:43.324 --> 01:42:45.534
I want communion, Father.

01:42:45.743 --> 01:42:47.411
I'm sorry, Mrs. Tredoni.

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.747
I can't give it to you now.

01:42:51.082 --> 01:42:52.208
I promised the police

01:42:54.919 --> 01:42:57.713
you'd come with Father Pat and me.

01:43:04.387 --> 01:43:06.681
But you give it that whore!
