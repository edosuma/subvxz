Hey, Kong! Check this out.

[both hooting]

Ha! Beat that, Panchi.

01:14.467 --> 01:15.509
- Are you okay?
- [sighs]

01:15.593 --> 01:18.179
Thanks to Kong's king-size reflexes.

01:19.555 --> 01:21.599
- [cell phone ringing]
- It's Amy.

01:21.683 --> 01:22.851
Hey, sis, how's it going?

01:22.934 --> 01:24.310
[Amy] Just heading back.

01:24.393 --> 01:26.354
Anyone think of anything else we need?

01:26.437 --> 01:28.189
[grunting]

01:29.482 --> 01:31.735
Nope, all good here.
Where are ya?

01:31.818 --> 01:33.111
Just crossing the bridge.

01:33.194 --> 01:36.030
I'll head for this week's rendezvous spot
and wait to meet Lukas.

01:36.114 --> 01:39.868
[Danny] <i>All this hide-and-seek stuff's
kind of cool, like we're super spies!</i>

01:39.951 --> 01:42.370
[chuckles] It's not a game, Danny.

01:42.453 --> 01:44.455
With Richard around,
we can't be too careful.

01:47.792 --> 01:48.793
[Richard] Hmm.

01:48.877 --> 01:52.380
It may be hard for the authorities to find
Lukas and his little friends,

01:52.463 --> 01:53.631
but not for me.

01:53.715 --> 01:55.842
Ready Ms. Amy Quon's ride.

02:02.265 --> 02:03.474
[loud crash]

02:03.557 --> 02:06.728
- [Amy shrieks]
- Amy! Amy, what happened?

02:06.811 --> 02:08.812
Something just tore open the roof!

02:08.896 --> 02:10.732
[stammers] But I can't see what it...

02:10.815 --> 02:13.692
I see our new cloaking technology
works well.

02:13.777 --> 02:17.155
We couldn't let Kong be the only one
with camouflage.

02:17.238 --> 02:20.950
Yes, must keep up with the Jonesys.

02:22.368 --> 02:23.953
Danny?

02:24.037 --> 02:26.622
Oh, no, my phone's jammed, too!

02:28.833 --> 02:30.501
[Amy shrieks]

02:30.584 --> 02:33.004
- [tires screeching]
- [man grunts]

02:33.087 --> 02:35.924
Police, a car just went off
the Golden Gate!

02:42.847 --> 02:46.350
- <i>Good evening, dear brother.</i>
- Not surprised to hear from me?

02:46.434 --> 02:49.854
Well, who else would send me
a scrambled transmission?

02:49.938 --> 02:51.272
Now, before you ask,

02:51.355 --> 02:54.150
I had nothing to do
with Amy's disappearance.

02:54.233 --> 02:55.944
Then how did you know about it?

02:56.027 --> 02:57.904
It's all over the news.

02:57.987 --> 03:00.489
You really must keep up
with current events.

03:00.573 --> 03:04.202
The report says her car was probably
swept right out to sea.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.578
[whimpering] No!

03:05.661 --> 03:09.457
Oh, can Danny hear me? Sorry.

03:09.540 --> 03:10.834
Ugh, where is she?

03:10.917 --> 03:12.543
How on earth would I know?

03:12.626 --> 03:15.379
But then,
if I believed she was still alive,

03:15.463 --> 03:18.257
and I was a famous tracker like you,

03:18.341 --> 03:19.800
I'd start tracking.

03:20.384 --> 03:23.679
What just happened? Where's my sister?
Where's Amy?

03:24.472 --> 03:26.182
Hey, Danny, it's okay.

03:26.265 --> 03:28.517
Amy is not gone, I'm sure of it.

03:28.601 --> 03:30.728
We just have to figure out
how to find her.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.314
I encrypted her GPS so only I can read it.

03:33.397 --> 03:35.649
We have to get Amy back!

03:35.733 --> 03:37.735
- I know someone that can help.
- Who?

03:37.819 --> 03:41.197
The guy that wants to lock me away
almost as much as Richard does.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.656
[all] Commissioner Decker?

03:42.740 --> 03:44.200
I'll reach out to him anonymously,

03:44.283 --> 03:46.870
since Decker thinks
I'm public enemy number one.

03:46.953 --> 03:49.747
[grunting]

03:49.831 --> 03:51.415
Oh, sorry, bro.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.625
You're number one.

03:52.708 --> 03:54.168
But I'm a close second.

03:54.252 --> 03:55.962
[grunting]

04:00.341 --> 04:02.844
This is ridiculous, Commissioner.

04:02.927 --> 04:06.430
I don't know who tipped you off,
but I hardly knew Amy Quon.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.099
She worked with my brother,

04:08.182 --> 04:10.268
and I have not seen her
since his monster ape

04:10.351 --> 04:12.478
destroyed everything my father and I
worked for.

04:12.561 --> 04:14.230
- [man yelps]
- Don't touch that!

04:14.313 --> 04:15.314
[gasps]

04:15.398 --> 04:19.903
Instead of wasting time here,
shouldn't you be out trying to find them?

04:20.569 --> 04:23.197
Hey, I'm doing all I can.

04:23.281 --> 04:26.409
I've got the mayor and the governor
breathing down my neck,

04:26.492 --> 04:28.119
and everybody's demanding to know

04:28.202 --> 04:31.164
why I can't find an ape
as big as a building.

04:31.247 --> 04:35.293
Well, Commissioner, you know you can
count on me to help in any way.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.710
[Decker] Thanks.

04:36.794 --> 04:39.838
Okay, false alarm, let's move out.

04:46.262 --> 04:48.890
[sighs] Alone at last.

04:48.973 --> 04:50.934
Almost.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.518
Botila!

04:53.061 --> 04:54.520
[Amy grunts]

04:57.065 --> 04:59.025
Why are you doing this?

04:59.108 --> 05:03.612
Just tell me where to find Lukas' hideout
and you'll be free to go.

05:03.696 --> 05:05.406
I have no idea.

05:05.489 --> 05:07.283
Wrong answer.

05:07.366 --> 05:09.785
I'm betting you and my brother
are still in contact

05:09.868 --> 05:13.872
and the Commissioner's sudden visit
means Lukas is already trying to find you.

05:13.957 --> 05:17.418
Ms. Quon and I need more time to...
negotiate.

05:17.501 --> 05:20.796
Scatter a few bread crumbs
to lead my brother astray for a while.

05:25.093 --> 05:27.428
- [beeping]
- [Jonesy] Hello!

05:27.511 --> 05:30.348
A GPS signal just came in
from Amy's car...

05:30.431 --> 05:32.225
at the bottom of the Bay.

05:33.351 --> 05:36.270
- [Kong grunting]
- [sobbing] No!

05:36.354 --> 05:37.771
[Anita speaking Spanish]

05:37.855 --> 05:38.856
Don't worry.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.817
We know Richard's flying monster took Amy.

05:41.900 --> 05:44.320
[stammers] But then
why is her car in the water?

05:44.403 --> 05:48.324
I don't know, but I'm gonna
dive down there and find out.

05:48.407 --> 05:50.118
[grunts excitedly]

05:52.703 --> 05:55.456
- [Danny nervously] Are we there yet?
- Almost, Danny.

05:55.539 --> 05:58.917
Psst, why does Richard hate Kong so much?

05:59.002 --> 06:00.753
And his own brother, too.

06:00.836 --> 06:04.048
No one really knows
why Richard's so angry.

06:04.132 --> 06:05.549
Maybe not even him.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.551
That's so sad.

06:07.635 --> 06:08.886
You're twins!

06:08.969 --> 06:12.098
We might look alike, but that's about it.

06:13.891 --> 06:15.476
[Lukas] Whoa...

06:15.559 --> 06:17.895
Hey, Rich, come here!
I found the coolest insect!

06:17.978 --> 06:20.273
[Richard] Bugs, ugh!

06:20.356 --> 06:23.317
[Kong grunts excitedly]

06:23.401 --> 06:25.236
No, Kong, you'll...

06:26.570 --> 06:28.197
crush it. [sighs]

06:28.281 --> 06:29.823
[gasps]

06:31.617 --> 06:33.327
- [Kong grunts nervously]
- [beetle squeaks]

06:33.411 --> 06:34.828
[hoots happily]

06:35.788 --> 06:38.666
[laughing] I'm glad your feet are so big,

06:38.749 --> 06:41.585
and that Anita made you wash off
your toe-jam.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.254
[grunting]

06:46.882 --> 06:49.052
Kong missed, but we won't!

06:49.135 --> 06:51.845
T-Rex and me crushed a bunch already.

06:52.763 --> 06:54.057
Richard, stop!

06:55.558 --> 06:56.684
[Kong grunts]

07:00.979 --> 07:03.149
Look what you did, you stinking ape!

07:03.232 --> 07:06.360
You'll pay for that! You both will!

07:08.696 --> 07:10.864
Guess we've always seen life differently.

07:10.948 --> 07:15.994
If I had a brother or sister,
I bet we would be best friends.

07:16.079 --> 07:17.705
That's how it is with Amy and me.

07:17.788 --> 07:18.872
[hoots softly]

07:21.459 --> 07:23.419
[grunting]

07:28.424 --> 07:29.758
[grunting continues]

07:35.973 --> 07:37.725
- [alarm beeps]
- [Kong gasps]

07:39.352 --> 07:40.769
[both giggling]

07:43.981 --> 07:44.982
[both laughing]

07:45.066 --> 07:47.943
Okay, bro, better wrap it up
before someone spots...

07:48.026 --> 07:49.653
- [beeping]
- We got two Air Force fighter jets

07:49.737 --> 07:50.988
coming up fast!

07:52.740 --> 07:54.408
Kong, switch on the camo!

07:54.492 --> 07:55.868
[grunts]

07:57.286 --> 07:59.663
But what if we can't get rid of them
before it times out?

08:01.540 --> 08:03.376
Gentlemen, is there a problem?

08:03.459 --> 08:04.543
[pilot 1] We're picking up

08:04.627 --> 08:07.045
an unidentifiable aircraft reading
in the area.

08:07.130 --> 08:09.590
Really? We haven't seen anything unusual.

08:09.673 --> 08:10.924
Not a thing.

08:14.095 --> 08:15.679
[beeping]

08:19.725 --> 08:22.019
[pilot 2] Copy that, but if you do,
please report it.

08:22.103 --> 08:24.021
Roger that, you got it.

08:26.064 --> 08:27.941
[exhales] Close one.

08:29.818 --> 08:32.196
That's a good look on you, bro.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.614
[grunting]

08:53.801 --> 08:55.428
[whimpering]

08:56.887 --> 08:58.306
Don't worry, Kong.

08:58.389 --> 08:59.598
Lukas is okay.

08:59.682 --> 09:01.517
[Lukas] I found it!

09:02.059 --> 09:03.186
Is she...

09:03.269 --> 09:04.853
She's not in the car.

09:04.937 --> 09:06.855
[exclaims] That's fantastic!

09:08.482 --> 09:11.319
- I'll just check if there's any clue...
- [creature chitters]

09:12.570 --> 09:13.862
[panting]

09:14.822 --> 09:16.114
[grunts]

09:17.450 --> 09:18.742
Lukas, what's happening?

09:18.826 --> 09:20.369
[Lukas on radio] <i>Megalodons!</i>

09:20.453 --> 09:23.080
- [Danny gasps]
- Prehistoric sharks?

09:23.164 --> 09:24.873
Robots made by Richard.

09:24.957 --> 09:26.041
Another trap.

09:26.124 --> 09:28.919
Kong, you have to help Lukas!

09:30.338 --> 09:32.173
[grunting]

09:32.256 --> 09:33.716
He can't swim!

09:33.799 --> 09:36.802
He doesn't need to.
His jet-pack works just like Lukas'.

09:36.885 --> 09:38.471
Kong, do you understand?

09:38.554 --> 09:40.223
[grunts nervously]

09:40.306 --> 09:42.683
Take a really deep breath.

09:42.766 --> 09:43.851
Like this!

09:43.934 --> 09:45.519
[inhales deeply]

09:46.645 --> 09:48.272
- Okay?
- [grunts]

09:48.356 --> 09:50.107
[inhales deeply]

09:50.191 --> 09:52.025
Now go get those sharks!

09:55.363 --> 09:57.781
- [glass splintering]
- [Lukas grunts]

10:00.784 --> 10:01.994
[grunts]

10:13.046 --> 10:14.590
[saw teeth whirring]

10:23.516 --> 10:24.850
[Kong grunting]

10:33.859 --> 10:36.194
[Lukas grunts] Kong!

10:47.080 --> 10:48.707
[saw teeth whirring]

10:55.589 --> 10:58.133
[Lukas] Come on, let's get out of here!

11:01.720 --> 11:04.222
Kong, I'm so proud of you!

11:04.307 --> 11:06.642
[hoots happily]

11:06.725 --> 11:11.021
[laughs] But first chance we get,
I am so teaching you how to swim.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.565
[grunts]

11:15.233 --> 11:18.821
Don't those two bionobots attacking you
prove Richard kidnapped Amy?

11:18.904 --> 11:21.990
To us, but after the failed search
on Kong Island,

11:22.074 --> 11:25.369
as far as the police are concerned,
Richard's not involved.

11:25.453 --> 11:27.455
- [radar beeping]
- Look, a new signal!

11:27.538 --> 11:29.332
This time it's from Amy's phone.

11:29.415 --> 11:31.750
It's Richard again.
Playing us!

11:31.834 --> 11:33.293
So what do we do?

11:33.377 --> 11:34.753
We have to check it out.

11:34.837 --> 11:37.673
And hope to find a clue
where she really is.

11:37.756 --> 11:41.051
You're making this difficult for me.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.970
Then why not let me go?

11:43.053 --> 11:45.263
Show me where Lukas
and his ape are hiding,

11:45.348 --> 11:47.057
and I'll be happy to.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.393
I'll even make it worth your while.

11:50.102 --> 11:52.312
In what way, exactly?

11:52.396 --> 11:55.858
Between your knowledge of animals
and my engineering skills,

11:55.941 --> 11:57.610
we could be powerful.

11:57.693 --> 12:00.779
You could join me... as my partner.

12:02.490 --> 12:03.949
Interesting...

12:04.032 --> 12:06.994
but I thought she was your partner.

12:07.077 --> 12:08.996
[chuckles] Don't be ridiculous.

12:09.079 --> 12:10.998
She's the hired help.

12:11.081 --> 12:13.333
Botila does what she's told.

12:13.417 --> 12:16.211
Look, I really don't know where Lukas is.

12:16.294 --> 12:17.755
I wish I did.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.507
My brother is still with him.

12:19.590 --> 12:23.719
I've seen how crazy Kong gets,
so I'm worried sick about Danny.

12:25.053 --> 12:26.805
As you should be.

12:26.889 --> 12:29.975
So why don't we work together
to find them?

12:30.058 --> 12:34.897
Fine, but I really don't have any idea
where they might be.

12:34.980 --> 12:38.734
Then maybe you need a little more
time to think about it!

12:41.654 --> 12:45.198
- I assure you, I am not easily replaced.
- [Amy grunts]

12:48.744 --> 12:50.663
- [console beeping]
- [Amy struggling]

12:55.208 --> 12:56.919
[straining]

13:07.513 --> 13:08.806
[beeping]

13:08.889 --> 13:12.976
- And the signal just stopped.
- There's a surprise.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.352
[Decker on loudspeaker] Lukas Remy!

13:14.437 --> 13:16.063
This is Commissioner Decker!

13:16.146 --> 13:19.399
Well, that second tip really paid off.

13:19.483 --> 13:20.609
[beeping]

13:20.693 --> 13:23.529
- Can we make a break for it?
- Probably not the best time.

13:23.612 --> 13:25.197
[sirens wailing]

13:28.158 --> 13:30.994
[Decker] I want to see hands in the air!

13:32.871 --> 13:34.372
[Lukas] You heard him, bro.

13:34.457 --> 13:36.625
Hands way up.

13:36.709 --> 13:38.043
[grunts]

13:47.886 --> 13:48.887
Good, Kong!

13:48.971 --> 13:51.223
But try not to hurt anybody!

13:54.184 --> 13:55.728
Get us out of here, Jonesy!

13:55.811 --> 13:57.187
[Kong grunting]

13:59.064 --> 14:00.566
[men screaming]

14:02.776 --> 14:04.778
Hold your fire!

14:09.950 --> 14:11.451
- Good save, Kong!
- [guns firing]

14:11.535 --> 14:13.411
Then why are they shooting again?

14:13.496 --> 14:16.957
Hey, when it comes to the big guy,
no good deed goes unpunished.

14:18.584 --> 14:20.043
[grunting]

14:20.711 --> 14:23.005
- [men groaning]
- [Kong roars]

14:24.882 --> 14:26.383
[men screaming]

14:28.594 --> 14:32.640
[scoffs] I can't believe
we lost them again!

14:34.432 --> 14:37.561
I can't believe that giant
didn't hurt anybody.

14:37.645 --> 14:40.188
- [beeping]
- [Lukas] Where now?

14:40.272 --> 14:43.400
Moving south fast.
Guess we're heading towards LA.

14:43.484 --> 14:46.945
No, it'll just be another trap to keep us
from where he's really holding Amy.

14:47.029 --> 14:48.906
It's gotta be Kong Island, right?

14:48.989 --> 14:51.366
The police already searched there
and found nothing.

14:51.449 --> 14:54.578
Then they didn't search hard enough.
Now it's our turn.

14:54.662 --> 14:56.079
But we need to be smart about it.

14:56.163 --> 14:59.457
If he picks up our chopper coming,
we'll lose any element of surprise.

14:59.542 --> 15:02.294
Then we'll just have to grab
a better ride.

15:03.754 --> 15:05.422
[Lukas chuckles] You okay?

15:05.506 --> 15:07.966
You know I like to be in control
when I fly.

15:08.676 --> 15:10.511
- [Jonesy screaming]
- [Kong grunts]

15:11.637 --> 15:12.805
[yelps]

15:16.809 --> 15:20.187
[gasps] Not funny, mister! Not funny!

15:21.730 --> 15:23.440
Time for camo mode, bro.

15:23.524 --> 15:25.734
We'll survey the island from the air.

15:26.401 --> 15:29.112
But I'm betting he's got Amy
somewhere in his lab.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.531
- [Kong grunts]
- [Lukas] Come on.

15:30.614 --> 15:33.576
Jonesy, let's disable the alarm,
then start searching for Amy.

15:33.659 --> 15:36.995
Bro, you stay here and be ready to fly
the second we get back.

15:37.079 --> 15:40.165
- [Danny] Kong wants to help find Amy.
- [Kong grunts]

15:40.248 --> 15:42.668
I really need you to stick with the plan.

15:42.751 --> 15:44.545
Just this once, okay?

15:44.628 --> 15:45.879
[groans]

15:57.933 --> 15:59.101
[Kong chitters]

16:00.518 --> 16:01.979
[grunting]

16:05.398 --> 16:06.609
[roaring]

16:17.535 --> 16:18.829
[Kong grunts]

16:21.164 --> 16:22.415
Can you get us in?

16:26.169 --> 16:27.504
[growling]

16:28.672 --> 16:29.673
[slamming]

16:42.895 --> 16:43.979
[roaring]

16:57.284 --> 16:58.410
[whooshing]

16:58.493 --> 16:59.620
[creature chitters]

17:02.873 --> 17:05.125
- [yelps]
- Check the lab, then we'll...

17:05.208 --> 17:06.417
[whooshing]

17:21.098 --> 17:22.267
[Danny yelps]

17:33.195 --> 17:34.529
Danny, Panchi, stay back.

17:34.612 --> 17:36.114
[Panchi] Sure.
[Danny] You bet.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.534
- [whip snapping]
- [Jonesy gasps]

17:39.617 --> 17:41.369
Richard's old toy has a new job.

17:43.872 --> 17:45.498
Any suggestions?

17:45.582 --> 17:48.293
How about we handle this like we did
back in college?

17:49.502 --> 17:51.088
[roars]

17:54.174 --> 17:56.384
[both grunting]

18:07.688 --> 18:08.856
[groans]

18:15.278 --> 18:16.321
[clanging]

18:16.905 --> 18:17.948
[both gasp]

18:21.409 --> 18:23.078
[both grunting]

18:23.161 --> 18:24.537
[Kong roars]

18:30.919 --> 18:32.004
[grunts]

18:33.213 --> 18:35.673
[yelps and grunts]

18:35.758 --> 18:36.842
[growls]

18:42.723 --> 18:43.849
[grunts]

18:44.349 --> 18:46.059
[crashing]

18:50.188 --> 18:52.315
All right, so where were we?

18:52.399 --> 18:55.068
Never mind us, where are the kids?

18:55.152 --> 18:56.862
They must have headed for the lab.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.159
Any sign of Amy?

19:02.242 --> 19:03.618
[Panchi] Not yet.

19:07.372 --> 19:09.166
Look, this is Amy's.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.834
So she was here!

19:10.918 --> 19:12.169
Where'd she go?

19:12.252 --> 19:14.587
- Remember those old spooky movies?
- Yeah.

19:14.671 --> 19:16.506
Sliding panels, fake walls.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.216
Richard and I used to watch them.

19:18.716 --> 19:19.717
Ow!

19:20.593 --> 19:23.555
- Hey, that hurts!
- Leave my brother alone!

19:23.638 --> 19:25.473
Let go of the boy, Botila.

19:25.557 --> 19:26.558
I will.

19:26.641 --> 19:29.102
Once I hand everyone over to Richard.

19:29.186 --> 19:31.104
[Jonesy] Pretty low, hiding behind a kid.

19:31.188 --> 19:32.940
- Sorry I have to...
- [zapping]

19:33.023 --> 19:35.525
And I'm sorry I had to zap you.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.485
Actually, you deserved it.

19:37.569 --> 19:39.029
I knew you'd find me!

19:39.112 --> 19:41.281
[Danny] I'm so glad you're okay!

19:41.364 --> 19:43.491
Better get out of here
before Botila comes to.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.955
Good riddance to my replacement.

19:48.038 --> 19:50.248
[Lukas] All we have to do
is get Kong, and...

19:50.332 --> 19:52.500
Turn him over to me!

19:52.584 --> 19:54.711
Forget it, Richard, we're leaving.

19:57.297 --> 20:01.093
- [screeching]
- My winged friend begs to differ.

20:01.176 --> 20:02.302
[loud smashing]

20:02.385 --> 20:03.846
[Kong roaring]

20:14.940 --> 20:16.524
- [crashing]
- [Richard exclaims]

20:21.529 --> 20:23.115
- [Kong grunting]
- No!

20:23.198 --> 20:24.366
Oh, no!

20:24.449 --> 20:27.535
- [roaring]
- [screams]

20:28.703 --> 20:29.787
[groans]

20:37.170 --> 20:40.173
- [angrily] Why did you let them get away?
- Why did you?

20:41.424 --> 20:44.928
Amy was never going to tell us
what we want to know.

20:45.012 --> 20:47.931
So I arranged for her to show us.

20:53.145 --> 20:57.690
[Lukas] Okay, bro, take us back
to the chopper so we can head for home.

20:57.774 --> 21:01.444
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine, Danny, I promise.

21:01.528 --> 21:03.864
So, he didn't brainwash you or anything?

21:03.947 --> 21:05.448
No, nothing.

21:05.532 --> 21:08.618
Probably thanks to Botila,
strangely enough.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.329
[Jonesy] Man, she is
seriously unpredictable.

21:11.413 --> 21:13.706
Richard wanted to find the hideout.

21:13.790 --> 21:16.293
I don't know what Botila was after.

21:19.171 --> 21:21.173
