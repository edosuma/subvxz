A SERIES BASED ON THE BOOK "ANNA"
WRITTEN BY NICCOLÒ AMMANITI IN 2015

00:19.560 --> 00:22.200
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
HIT 6 MONTHS AFTER FILMING BEGAN

00:23.800 --> 00:26.960
YOU GOTTA MAKE ICE CREAM

00:53.160 --> 00:54.320
What are you doing here?

00:57.240 --> 00:58.240
Anna!

01:02.480 --> 01:04.720
Nobody goes out, is that clear?

01:04.800 --> 01:07.920
Your parents are coming to get you.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.240
Where's Mama?

01:36.920 --> 01:38.880
Where's Mama?

01:40.520 --> 01:43.400
Anna, where's Mama?

01:47.160 --> 01:49.040
Where is she?

01:49.120 --> 01:50.320
Let go of me.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.240
Where's your mom?

01:58.160 --> 02:00.840
I don't know, she's not answering.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.880
- I was told to wait here.
- You can't wait here.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.520
You can't be left alone,
we'll call her now.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.280
We'll call your mom.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.200
Where's Mama?

02:50.960 --> 02:53.600
Buying chocolate.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.360
Is it an ambulance?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.280
With a doctor?

03:20.240 --> 03:21.520
Damiano.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.720
You've got something
on your shoulder.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.160
It was that way.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.400
Sure it was this way?

03:50.600 --> 03:52.360
Anna, will you answer me?

03:52.440 --> 03:56.480
- Anna, will you answer me?
- I think so.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.280
At a certain point Mama turns off.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.800
At a certain point she turns off.

04:04.400 --> 04:08.800
Hello, it's me again.
Anna can't remember the way.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.320
We've just turned into a street...

04:11.400 --> 04:13.960
The third off the main road.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.200
Call me as soon as you can.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.600
- How long have you had it?
- It's eczema.

04:22.680 --> 04:27.120
- How long?
- How the fuck would I know? A week.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.000
- And you didn't say anything?
- It's eczema, what can I say?

04:31.080 --> 04:34.080
You thoughtless asshole!

04:39.360 --> 04:41.200
- What're you doing?
- Get out!

04:41.280 --> 04:43.280
And go where?

04:43.360 --> 04:46.640
- What are you saying?
- You've got to go!

04:46.720 --> 04:48.920
There are kids here, your son.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.240
Your son is two,
or is that too hard to understand?

04:52.320 --> 04:54.120
You're infected!

04:54.200 --> 04:57.280
- Don't touch me!
- But where do I go?

04:57.400 --> 04:59.080
Go to the hospital precinct,

04:59.160 --> 05:01.800
they'll quarantine you,
treat you, I don't know!

05:01.880 --> 05:05.400
- But that's where you're going.
- I'm not going into quarantine.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.880
You can't stay here!

05:08.320 --> 05:10.440
Help me, what should I do?

05:13.400 --> 05:15.760
- I'm calling emergency.
- No!

05:15.840 --> 05:16.920
Maria Grazia!

05:22.320 --> 05:23.640
Fuck!

05:25.720 --> 05:28.040
There's no signal anymore.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.960
- Miss...
- I'm sorry but I don't remember.

05:33.120 --> 05:37.600
Never mind, I'll go in
and see if there's a phone.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.600
Miss, I don't remember.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.480
Stay here.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.920
Excuse me.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.920
Can I...?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.400
Can I ask you something? Excuse me.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.160
Help.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.000
Help.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.040
Stay here, lock the doors.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.200
<i>During the night,
fires were set all over the city.</i>

07:52.280 --> 07:56.440
<i>Neither the virus nor the corpses in the
streets can quell the urban warfare.</i>

07:57.880 --> 08:02.400
<i>Children looted
department stores in town...</i>

08:16.680 --> 08:19.320
If we play a game I'll give you this.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.320
- Let's play the ghost game.
- Let me stick this on.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.120
- My hand.
- Get out.

08:30.920 --> 08:33.080
Wait, let me stick it on.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.600
- Just look at me.
- Wait...

08:42.560 --> 08:46.280
Maybe she slipped over.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.120
Let's play the ghost game.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.880
Careful.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.480
I've hurt myself here.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.080
Look.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.600
It hurts.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.280
Look.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.280
Yeah, we'll check it later.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.200
- Who's there?
- I got this.

10:44.280 --> 10:47.320
- It's all garbage.
- No, wait.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Give me that.

10:51.080 --> 10:54.320
Take this twice a day,
morning and night.

10:55.200 --> 10:59.240
- Now, get lost.
- Fuck you and your brother!

10:59.320 --> 11:01.280
Wait, twins!

11:01.360 --> 11:04.320
I got a bunch of stuff
that's worth a lot!

11:05.320 --> 11:07.840
I need it!

11:07.920 --> 11:09.560
Who was that?

11:09.640 --> 11:12.120
I paused it,
you're missing the best bit.

11:12.560 --> 11:15.160
A guy with Red Fever, he was sick.

11:15.280 --> 11:18.920
I gave him a hair supplement
and I got this.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.400
- What are you doing?
- Let us in!

11:25.920 --> 11:27.520
Come on.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.880
What?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.640
Come on!

11:30.720 --> 11:34.880
- What's this crap?
- At Aunt Marina's wedding.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.080
Papa danced with Aunty.

11:37.160 --> 11:40.720
There was a three-tier cake
with meringues.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.040
Shit, that's right!

12:13.040 --> 12:15.320
Mario, wake up.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.000
What is it?

12:23.200 --> 12:25.720
I think I got the Red Fever.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.720
What do you reckon?

12:35.400 --> 12:37.200
Check me, all over.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.240
- We'll burn down your store!
- Assholes!

12:42.640 --> 12:44.960
Twins, are you there?

12:45.040 --> 12:47.640
Open up, we got stuff to swap.

12:47.720 --> 12:51.320
We got heaps of batteries,
even a car battery.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.520
We're closed! Go away!

12:53.600 --> 12:57.640
- Open up, don't be such assholes!
- Go away!

13:00.240 --> 13:03.080
I told you, Paolo, I'll get it too.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.200
It'll just take a little longer.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.640
I think it's because
I came out of Mama after you.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.520
Know what we'll do?

13:19.600 --> 13:22.480
We'll close the store and eat everything.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.440
I'm not leaving it full of stuff,
Papa asked us not to.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.600
What do you say?

13:32.440 --> 13:34.680
Come on, Paolo, don't be like that.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.600
We'll even eat the Easter eggs.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.000
- The milk chocolate ones?
- Yeah.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.480
What are you doing there?

16:42.560 --> 16:43.960
I threw up.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.240
Don't throw up in the drawers.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.440
Maybe that pancetta was bad.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.000
Did you eat anything else?

17:02.480 --> 17:05.920
The black things with the stones inside.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.480
What are they?

17:08.560 --> 17:12.160
Those round black things in water.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.400
- Toads?
- No, in jars.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.040
Olives.

17:33.280 --> 17:37.240
- Where did you find them?
- In the Outside, but I didn't go.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.360
How did you get them?

17:39.440 --> 17:41.160
With a stick.

17:42.240 --> 17:45.080
You mustn't do that again, promise me.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.320
Promise me.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.520
Not "promise me", I promise.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.000
I promise.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.320
Tomorrow, I'll search for something good.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.880
Okay, I'll be back early.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.960
- What do you have to do?
- I must never go past the rags.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.320
Or else?

18:23.400 --> 18:25.600
- I'll suffocate to death.
- Good boy.

18:26.520 --> 18:29.000
You'll suffocate to death.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.280
Come here.

18:50.160 --> 18:54.160
Mario, buddy, I feel so sick.

18:55.560 --> 19:00.200
Tell me about it,
Papa's special provolone has killed me.

19:02.560 --> 19:06.840
Mario, I've been thinking a lot
about this Red Fever thing,

19:06.960 --> 19:09.160
and the fact that only I got infected.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.400
You’ve always been the nice one,
and I’m the mean one.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.440
I got infected for us both, you're safe.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.640
Thank you, Paolo.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.520
You gotta promise me something,

19:41.600 --> 19:45.160
when I die, you gotta make ice cream.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.440
Chocolate ice cream.

19:48.520 --> 19:53.040
How can you make it without a fridge?

19:53.120 --> 19:56.920
There's another cold place: the cellar.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.800
We have long-life milk,

20:04.720 --> 20:08.840
chocolate too, and sugar.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.480
We even have cones,
they're in the boxes.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.560
All we need is a cellar.

20:18.720 --> 20:23.000
We'll dig a deep hole in the storeroom.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.400
It's like a basement.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.640
What could you swap an ice cream for?

20:32.080 --> 20:33.320
Anything.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.480
Promise you'll dig.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.320
I'll dig.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.200
Pietro!

21:21.040 --> 21:22.880
Hi.

21:22.960 --> 21:26.360
I was looking...
I wanted to see the lake.

21:26.440 --> 21:30.360
- You didn't come for me.
- Yes... no.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.240
A little bit.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.640
What are they?

21:37.720 --> 21:41.000
They're my tomatoes. Want one?

21:52.720 --> 21:55.200
- Good, huh?
- Really good.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.400
I haven't eaten one in years.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.560
My mother had a vegetable garden too,
she was obsessed.

22:04.440 --> 22:07.040
Then the Red Fever came and it all died.

22:08.680 --> 22:13.560
"The heterodontosaurus had

22:13.640 --> 22:17.560
two kinds of teeth:

22:17.640 --> 22:21.440
the small ones at the front

22:21.520 --> 22:27.520
were for tearing off leaves,

22:27.680 --> 22:32.960
the flatter ones at the back

22:33.080 --> 22:37.240
were for chewing.

22:39.640 --> 22:44.160
And now, a question for you:

22:45.160 --> 22:50.920
how many different kinds of teeth
do you have?"

22:52.640 --> 22:56.160
I have normal teeth

22:56.240 --> 22:59.120
and the ones that hurt.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.560
"My Family and Other Animals".

23:10.240 --> 23:12.600
- I like the title.
- Take it if you want.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.760
Do you want to go for a swim?

23:21.480 --> 23:23.640
No, I have to go home.

23:24.600 --> 23:28.240
- Admit you can't swim.
- I swim better than you.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.360
But I don't have a swimsuit.

23:31.440 --> 23:34.920
There are women's swimsuits
in that cupboard.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.200
Pick one out.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.400
What a pain!

24:00.840 --> 24:04.440
- What are you looking at?
- How the swimsuit fits.

24:04.520 --> 24:05.600
It fits just fine.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.440
Aren't you coming?

24:30.080 --> 24:33.240
Let's go! Move it!

24:41.320 --> 24:43.440
Now I'm going to show you something.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.680
I'll give you a shower.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.920
And... fire!

26:07.920 --> 26:10.080
There's smoke, look.

26:35.880 --> 26:38.400
I have front teeth!

26:38.480 --> 26:42.080
I am the electrodontosaurus!

27:13.120 --> 27:15.120
That puppet's so cool.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.280
Look at this, it's fantastic!

27:20.640 --> 27:24.520
- Just imagine there's pasta.
- Fair enough, there's meatloaf too.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.040
Look at this!

27:41.040 --> 27:43.600
Want me to check you for blotches?

27:49.480 --> 27:50.680
Well?

27:51.520 --> 27:53.360
No, I don't think so.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.200
And you?

27:56.320 --> 27:59.040
No, I haven't started bleeding yet.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.800
I remembered.

28:05.880 --> 28:08.400
- What?
- When I kissed you.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.200
-- You were in class 3
- B, right?
- No.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.880
- What?
- I didn't go to your school.

28:18.120 --> 28:20.160
So, who did I kiss?

28:20.240 --> 28:23.600
- Maybe you kissed too many people.
- Idiot.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.440
I don't remember much
about the Before.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.520
Me neither,

28:33.520 --> 28:35.520
just certain things.

28:37.120 --> 28:41.120
Sometimes I don't know
if they're memories or if I make them up.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.360
- Let go of it, it's mine!
- It's mine!

28:45.440 --> 28:47.240
I found it first!

28:55.560 --> 28:57.200
Look at me.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.680
Come here.

29:02.600 --> 29:05.960
- Are you all dead?
- Not yet.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.560
Are you ghosts?

29:10.640 --> 29:12.080
Come here.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.480
Do I look like a ghost?

29:21.680 --> 29:24.800
"Physiotherapy

29:24.880 --> 29:26.840
Di Tullio".

29:29.400 --> 29:32.160
Rosario, come and see
what they did with the bones.

29:35.480 --> 29:38.360
- Who taught you to read?
- Anna.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.040
Well done, Anna.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.560
This is for Angelica.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.320
Let's go.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.720
Let's go.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.560
Let's go and put some shoes on.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.400
What do I need this for?

30:34.240 --> 30:36.080
That's my mother!

30:40.440 --> 30:42.040
Move!

31:06.600 --> 31:08.680
There’s only a little left.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.560
- But won’t it hurt me?
- No.

31:21.640 --> 31:24.160
- Do you remember television?
- Yes, sure.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.120
Well, this is much better.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.440
I can't feel anything.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.000
It takes a while.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.440
So, we were at the beach,

31:56.560 --> 32:00.000
before the Red Fever,
you were with some girlfriends,

32:00.080 --> 32:01.760
you came up,
kissed me and ran off.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.440
No! Was that you?

32:07.520 --> 32:10.720
But it was a dare, it wasn't a kiss.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.680
It's not funny.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.440
Careful of the wire.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.120
One at a time.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.200
Move.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.440
I can't, there's the rags.

32:54.760 --> 32:56.000
Move!

33:01.560 --> 33:02.680
Come on!

33:11.000 --> 33:12.600
Now I'll show you.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.360
Get him!

33:22.920 --> 33:24.920
C'mon, get him!

33:58.280 --> 34:00.160
- Run!
- Where?

34:00.240 --> 34:01.680
Get him!

34:33.160 --> 34:35.320
- I lost him.
- Where is he?

34:35.400 --> 34:37.200
I don't know!

34:39.680 --> 34:42.000
Where did he go?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.200
- He's over there!
- Get him!

34:58.960 --> 35:00.320
Shall we try it?

35:01.920 --> 35:02.960
Here.

35:11.120 --> 35:14.800
<i>What's that face for? It's yummy.</i>

35:14.880 --> 35:17.880
Don't throw it! Stop it!

35:17.960 --> 35:19.240
Shall I throw it?

35:21.320 --> 35:23.160
Shall I throw it?

35:47.400 --> 35:48.680
There he is!

35:51.080 --> 35:53.200
It's too high, help him.

35:56.960 --> 35:59.280
Get down, get down!

35:59.360 --> 36:01.240
What are you doing?

36:01.320 --> 36:03.400
You don't want to come with us?

36:03.480 --> 36:04.960
Get down!

36:08.360 --> 36:10.320
Get down.

36:10.440 --> 36:12.040
Get down.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.680
You'll hurt yourself.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.120
Come to the party with us.

36:22.200 --> 36:25.680
There's a party, there's chocolate!

36:25.760 --> 36:28.560
- I said you'll hurt yourself.
- Come down.

38:03.520 --> 38:07.960
Mario, buddy, I'm exhausted.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.080
Let's swap.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.800
We've just swapped.

38:14.880 --> 38:18.400
We spend more time swapping
melons than walking.

38:19.240 --> 38:23.480
Yeah, but I always end up
carrying the heavy one.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.160
It's not fair.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.480
<i>Paolo, wake up!</i>

38:29.560 --> 38:31.560
You need to eat something.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.400
We still have chips.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.160
Or you'd prefer
something cool, a Bounty?

38:45.520 --> 38:47.400
I'm not hungry anymore.

38:51.280 --> 38:54.360
This is the worst thing
about this disease,

38:55.480 --> 38:57.440
not being hungry.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.480
Dying too.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.840
I'm gonna go dig.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.200
Blue...

40:37.400 --> 40:39.080
Astor!

42:01.360 --> 42:02.640
Anna.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.280
Mama.

42:34.040 --> 42:35.640
What's the matter?

42:36.800 --> 42:39.200
Did you have fun today?

42:44.680 --> 42:46.720
I feel sick.

42:48.560 --> 42:52.200
And your brother?
You're not going to look for him?

43:53.520 --> 43:54.960
Pietro!

44:05.080 --> 44:07.960
Anna, why did you leave?

44:08.040 --> 44:10.960
- What happened to your hand?
- Take me to the Blue Kids.

44:13.040 --> 44:16.120
- Why?
- Because they took my brother.

44:16.480 --> 44:19.000
- You have a brother?
- Yes.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.880
It’s your fault they took him.

44:21.960 --> 44:25.200
- What have I got to do with it?
- Plenty.

44:25.280 --> 44:28.480
If you hadn’t given me that shit
that got me stoned, I’d have been home.

44:28.560 --> 44:30.440
Where are the Blue Kids?

44:30.520 --> 44:32.520
In Bagheria, but I don't know where.

44:33.360 --> 44:34.400
Take me there.

44:35.520 --> 44:38.720
If your brother's with them,
you won't get him back.

44:40.320 --> 44:43.520
I'll get him back all right,
he's my brother.

44:43.600 --> 44:45.360
- Take me there.
- No.

44:47.160 --> 44:49.480
Go to the twins, they have maps.

44:52.960 --> 44:56.680
I knew you were a dickhead, and a wimp.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.000
Open up!

45:06.680 --> 45:09.080
Twins, are you there?

45:14.240 --> 45:16.440
Open up, I got stuff to swap.

45:20.120 --> 45:21.480
Open up!

45:27.200 --> 45:30.600
We're closed, no more swapping.

45:30.680 --> 45:34.200
Open up, please. I need a map.

45:34.280 --> 45:38.040
I'm Anna Salemi, class 3C.

45:38.120 --> 45:40.240
Remember? Open up.

45:50.280 --> 45:53.040
Salemi Anna, 3C...

45:53.120 --> 45:56.080
Yeah, it's me, open up.

45:56.160 --> 45:58.200
There's no more swapping.

45:58.320 --> 45:59.760
Open up, please.

46:32.960 --> 46:35.520
Which one of the two are you?

46:35.600 --> 46:37.000
Paolo.

46:38.160 --> 46:41.360
- Where's your brother?
- We're not doing swaps anymore.

46:43.320 --> 46:44.880
I need a map of Sicily.

46:53.080 --> 46:54.200
All new.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.960
Know how many batteries a map costs?

46:59.000 --> 47:00.400
I'll bring more.

47:04.600 --> 47:06.760
- Have you got the Red Fever?
- No.

47:06.840 --> 47:08.640
Put your backpack on the floor.

47:17.320 --> 47:19.160
Take your jacket off.

47:30.120 --> 47:33.320
Lift your T-shirt, show me.

47:41.400 --> 47:42.680
Happy?

47:45.200 --> 47:47.880
Where do you need to go?

47:47.960 --> 47:51.120
- To Bagheria, to the Blue Kids.
- The Blue Kids?

47:53.280 --> 47:57.280
They tried to get into my store,
I caught one.

47:58.680 --> 48:00.840
- He doesn't speak.
- Where is he?

48:02.960 --> 48:04.720
I keep him down in the storeroom.

48:06.840 --> 48:08.240
Wanna see him?

48:14.320 --> 48:16.240
I swear on Mario's head.

48:19.520 --> 48:21.360
All right...

48:21.440 --> 48:22.640
Wait.

48:40.320 --> 48:41.600
Come.

48:54.120 --> 48:56.040
Come, it's this way.

49:04.520 --> 49:05.920
Come.

49:16.320 --> 49:17.400
Open it.

49:35.240 --> 49:36.600
What...?

49:56.720 --> 49:59.120
What have you done to me?

49:59.200 --> 50:01.680
What have you done to me?

50:01.760 --> 50:03.920
A little mouse in the glue.
