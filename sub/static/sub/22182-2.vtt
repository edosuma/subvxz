WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:04.172
You're the first Special Ops
chick I ever met.

00:04.205 --> 00:06.707
How do you control yourself
around so many hot sweaty men?

00:06.740 --> 00:08.142
Only hard part's the smell, sir.

00:08.176 --> 00:09.110
(laughs)

00:10.811 --> 00:12.012
They have the package.

00:14.148 --> 00:14.782
(screams)

00:18.119 --> 00:20.688
(panting)
I'm an American citizen!

00:20.721 --> 00:22.256
Don't let him do this!
Move!

00:22.290 --> 00:23.491
Or I will shoot through you.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.263
(panting):
He's dead.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.531
We lied in our debriefs.

00:30.564 --> 00:31.465
We made that decision together.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.067
Today,

00:33.101 --> 00:34.802
we welcome back to duty,
Captain Leland Gallo

00:34.835 --> 00:37.271
and Warrant Officer Nora Madani.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.173
They told us we were targeting
a Somali national that night.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.509
Hey, hey!
Instead, we get
an American soldier.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.444
His name is Davis Foundry.
He's listed as killed in action

00:43.477 --> 00:45.079
in 2014.

00:45.113 --> 00:46.114
PORTER:
CIA has their eye on you.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.815
Any idea why?
It's my job

00:47.848 --> 00:49.850
to know when someone
is hiding something.

00:49.883 --> 00:50.684
And you are.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.820
HASKINS:
Jimmy Kam's been captured,

00:52.853 --> 00:53.854
along with Sergeant Hendrix.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.323
And we are assembling a team

00:55.356 --> 00:57.291
to plan and execute
a rescue mission.

00:57.325 --> 00:58.692
I am gonna get myself
on the team

00:58.726 --> 01:01.061
that goes in.
We will get him back.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.102
(radio static)
Puntland Approach,

01:08.136 --> 01:09.203
this is Cloud Eye.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.772
I'm 55 to your west at
31,000 feet, inbound. Over.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.607
PUNTLAND MILITARY MAN:
This is Puntland Approach.

01:13.641 --> 01:17.745
Our airspace is closed to
U.S. Army. You must turn back.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.313
AIR FORCE PILOT:
Do not copy. Say again.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.648
PUNTLAND MILITARY MAN:
You must turn around. Now.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.783
Do we know anything about this?

01:22.816 --> 01:24.618
No, sir.
Get JSOC on the line.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.120
Cloud Eye, do not,
I repeat,

01:26.154 --> 01:27.788
do not alter your
flight plan. Over.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.291
We are not risking
an international
incident over this.

01:30.324 --> 01:33.227
There are two American POWs
somewhere over that border.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.662
We need to get this
surveillance mission

01:34.695 --> 01:36.264
in the air
gathering intel now.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.599
They've got radar on me.
If you cross our border,

01:38.632 --> 01:40.901
we will be forced to open fire.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.637
Does Puntland even have ADA?
No ADA installation
on the satellite data.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.506
It's a bluff. Cloud Eye,
maintain course. Over.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.907
AIR FORCE PILOT:
Roger that, over.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.342
Colonel, let me remind you
that the CIA

01:48.376 --> 01:49.677
is in command of this operation.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.579
Ma'am, you never stop
reminding me.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.915
JSOC confirmed Puntland has just
restricted their air space.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.584
He crosses that border
in 60 seconds, Colonel.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.186
We need to call him off.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.488
PUNTLAND MILITARY MAN:
We will fire on you.

02:00.521 --> 02:04.192
Do you copy?
This is your last warning.

02:04.225 --> 02:07.261
You must turn back now.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.897
AIR FORCE PILOT:
This is Cloud Eye,
awaiting instructions.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.435
Cloud Eye.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.171
Abort mission. Return to base.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.206
Copy that.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.449
So what the hell do we do now?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.484
*

02:37.325 --> 02:39.327
*

02:40.328 --> 02:41.895
GALLO:
Morning, Madani.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.564
Hooah, sir.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.199
Colonel just called
a briefing.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.900
Perseus team only.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.602
Think there's news?

02:48.636 --> 02:49.970
Yeah, maybe.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.373
I saw my friend from the
archives last night.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.807
You saw her?

02:53.841 --> 02:55.576
Is that what the kids are
calling it these days?

02:55.609 --> 02:57.978
(chuckles) She can
get us the manifest

02:58.011 --> 03:00.414
from the last mission
Davis Goundry went on.

03:00.448 --> 03:03.251
The one where he was
listed as killed in action.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.552
Yeah. Three years
before we saw him

03:04.585 --> 03:06.220
in Somalia with
a bag over his head.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.989
The manifest will show us
who else was on his team.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.924
Maybe one of them can tell
us what really happened.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.461
Yeah, and why the CIA
wanted him dead.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.330
Hey, uh, (clears throat)
before we go in.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.831
Maybe we should talk about

03:17.865 --> 03:19.700
what happened at that
house the other night

03:19.733 --> 03:21.335
between us.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.736
(quietly):
Not the place.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.204
(sighs)

03:29.042 --> 03:30.010
Hey.
Hey.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.512
How you doing?
Fine.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.946
You look worried.
What's up?

03:32.980 --> 03:35.349
Whatever it is, I'm sure
Clark Kent here is on it.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.251
Clark Kent?
Clark Kent?

03:37.285 --> 03:38.919
(scoff) You do know
that I am black, right?

03:38.952 --> 03:40.721
Personality, dude.
You know, mild-mannered.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.390
It was a compliment.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.925
Ah, you're more of a Bruce Wayne
type. Black Bruce Wayne.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.694
Oh. And, uh, what's your
superhero, Captain?

03:46.727 --> 03:47.995
I always kind of liked
Green Lantern.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.763
No. No, no, no.
You are definitely

03:49.797 --> 03:51.432
more of a Jonah Hex.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.667
Yeah. Psycho cowboy thing.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.436
Pretty sure that's
not a compliment.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.937
THEA:
Take a seat.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.372
We have some new arrivals
to welcome today.

03:58.406 --> 04:01.309
Our Delta Force partners
in the operation,

04:01.342 --> 04:02.510
they are TDY for the duration.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.746
You got to
be kidding me.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.014
Adam Coogan's
on this thing?

04:07.047 --> 04:09.650
THEA: Gentlemen,
let me remind you

04:09.683 --> 04:11.352
that Operation Perseus
is classified.

04:11.385 --> 04:14.322
Sergeants Kam and Hendrix
are officially MIA.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.590
Their POW status, however,

04:16.624 --> 04:19.360
is not, and will not
be made public.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.928
We believe they
are being held

04:20.961 --> 04:22.663
in an autonomous region of
Somalia called Puntland.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.432
This morning,
the Puntland government

04:24.465 --> 04:26.334
closed its airspace to us.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.302
THEA: They're pissed off
that a U.S. Black Hawk crashed

04:28.336 --> 04:29.670
in their borders on an op they'd
never even heard about.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.539
This is how
they're retaliating.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.074
Means our rescue mission
just hit a wall,

04:34.107 --> 04:36.844
along with our efforts to find
CIA Officer Richard

04:36.877 --> 04:38.546
and the prisoner he had
in custody.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.514
Ma'am. This prisoner,
you mind telling us

04:40.548 --> 04:41.949
who it is exactly?

04:41.982 --> 04:43.784
A high-value Somali insurgent.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.018
The name is classified.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.020
DC is working on a range
of diplomatic solutions

04:47.054 --> 04:49.857
to get the airspace reopened,
but it will take some time.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.492
HASKINS:
Translation:

04:51.525 --> 04:53.994
a bunch of politicians,
most of whom have never served,

04:54.027 --> 04:56.364
are now calling the shots.
We have three members

04:56.397 --> 04:58.098
of the House Intel Committee
visiting us this week.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.335
They have questions about
whether the Shadow Raiders

05:01.369 --> 05:02.936
are the right unit
for this job,

05:02.970 --> 05:04.872
since it did begin with one of
your helos going down.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.440
HASKINS: They'll be
guests of honor

05:06.474 --> 05:07.941
at the Military Ball.
Beforehand,

05:07.975 --> 05:09.610
we'll give them
a demo exercise.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.745
Target engagements
with live fire.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.581
You need to impress them.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.983
I cannot stress that enough.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.085
Is there a problem, Captain?

05:18.118 --> 05:20.654
Yeah. I don't like wasting time
with dog and pony shows.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.122
HASKINS: You want
to save our guys?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.057
This is how you start.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.959
Which brings me
to helo assignments.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.796
Sergeant Darzi will step in
as your crew chief.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.631
And the Delta Force team leader
for your bird

05:30.664 --> 05:31.799
will be Sergeant Coogan.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.103
So, what's the story?

05:36.136 --> 05:38.138
Coogan and I served
together in the 384th.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.907
I got a promotion
he wanted.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.809
A girl, too.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.644
Of course
there was a girl.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.846
What happened to her?

05:45.879 --> 05:47.848
Relationships
are complicated.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.116
Yeah.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.120
True that.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.924
It did seem a little tense
with y'all this morning.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.660
He knows I'm
hiding something.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.128
Well, sometimes you
got to sacrifice

06:01.161 --> 06:03.030
for the bigger
picture. Right now,

06:03.063 --> 06:05.699
that means you
keep lying. Me, too.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.401
Until when?

06:07.435 --> 06:09.403
Till we prove we did the
right thing over there.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.472
HASKINS:
Captain Gallo.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.043
The West Coast Battalion
is pushing

06:16.076 --> 06:17.445
to be on this rescue mission

06:17.478 --> 06:18.679
instead of us.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.113
We can't let
that happen.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.449
We need to be squared
away for this demo.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.583
No hotdogging.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.453
Ah. Let us give them a show.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.421
Hey, I don't want you
flying below 50 feet.

06:27.455 --> 06:30.090
Too dangerous with a member
of Congress on your bird.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.759
If you do, it's a
letter of reprimand.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.462
And I want you cleaned up
before this ball, too.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.630
I understand Special Ops has
relaxed grooming standards,

06:36.664 --> 06:38.198
but this is ridiculous.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.568
You've been back
in garrison over a week now.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.902
You're dismissed.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.572
Yes, sir.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.442
I'm gonna go see Jess.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.910
Catch you later.
Yep.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.855
Nora.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.957
You know Mrs. Leigh

07:03.991 --> 07:05.158
and Mrs. Darzi.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.660
It's nice to see you guys.

07:06.694 --> 07:09.129
Well, we'll catch y'all
at the ball on Friday.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.798
Hooah.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.065
Take care.
Yes.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.140
(sighs) Shouldn't they cancel
the damn ball?

07:20.173 --> 07:22.510
With everything that's going on.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.044
It's good for morale.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.213
And the unit needs it now
more than ever. You want some?

07:26.246 --> 07:28.549
No, I'm good.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.186
How are you holding up?

07:33.220 --> 07:34.888
I'm fine.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.558
(can opens)

07:41.094 --> 07:43.564
I'm a mess.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.165
And The Real Housewives

07:45.198 --> 07:48.502
of Fort Dabney want me to go
to some support group.

07:48.536 --> 07:49.903
Maybe it would help.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.540
Nora...

07:52.573 --> 07:54.942
you have no idea
what these women are like.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.746
Everything that you say
is gossiped across the base

07:58.779 --> 08:00.213
in hours.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.849
And judged.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.685
I don't want them
to see me looking weak.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.287
Jess...
you're anything but weak.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.023
I'm not even allowed...

08:10.057 --> 08:12.960
to tell them
that Jimmy's been...

08:15.328 --> 08:18.298
I just have to say
that he's missing.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.568
What is the point
of talking

08:20.601 --> 08:22.803
when there is so much
that I can't say?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.037
(softly):
Yeah.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.139
Guess I'm just used to it.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.275
I don't understand
how you do it.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.911
Find other ways to deal.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.014
Babe...

08:35.048 --> 08:37.885
I want to help.
What can I do?

08:37.918 --> 08:40.988
You can keep the promise
that you made me.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.890
You will be on the team
that goes in,

08:42.923 --> 08:44.324
and you will do...

08:44.357 --> 08:46.994
everything that it takes
to bring Jimmy back.

08:51.331 --> 08:54.101
(rock music playing,
indistinct chatter)

09:00.107 --> 09:01.975
GALLO:
This is 800 pounds of overkill.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.611
Yeah, well, we train
as we fight, Captain.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.245
That's the gear my guys need.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.413
No, it's way more
than standard.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.348
Your job's flying; mine's
what happens on the ground.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.618
This does not affect you.
Wrong.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.986
Too much weight means the helo
doesn't maneuver as well.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.888
Gonna make it real hard
to hit those targets.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.790
You know, the word is
that you and the lady

09:16.824 --> 09:18.626
are the best pilots
in the unit.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.595
You saying I heard that wrong?
No, that's right.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.230
But the name's Madani.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.766
Isn't Lady a dog in a movie?
(chuckles)

09:25.799 --> 09:28.602
Look, whatever
the issue is,

09:28.636 --> 09:31.271
we're a team now,
so we got to make it work.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.773
I'm not sure we do.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.908
You know, Sergeant
Hendrix happens to be

09:34.942 --> 09:37.110
one of my closest friends--
the way I see it,

09:37.144 --> 09:38.946
it's your fault
he's over there right now.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.014
I'm sorry.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.050
Say that again?

09:44.351 --> 09:47.788
You're dating
an intel officer, right?

09:47.821 --> 09:49.389
But if you think his
pull with the CIA

09:49.422 --> 09:51.358
is gonna keep you on
Perseus, you're wrong.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.827
Now, Delta Force is on this
no matter what, but that demo

09:53.861 --> 09:56.630
don't go good...
you guys aren't.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.632
Missing targets on purpose
would be pretty obvious.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.368
Well, if you don't line me up
for the shots, different story.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.404
Well, he's an epic dick.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.874
DARZI: I hope you guys
can figure this out.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.142
I'm not really into conflict.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.012
Not into conflict?

10:12.045 --> 10:14.314
Guy's a soldier.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.316
Okay, we definitely
have a problem.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.719
All this weight plus
two extra bodies

10:18.752 --> 10:20.353
for the ride-along...
Yeah.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.155
Stinks like a dead pig
in sunshine.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.692
Yeah, it's a Texas thing.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.326
Look, at least there's
some good news today.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.995
I got that mission manifest.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.697
Checked out the other guys
who were on it.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.798
A few have retired.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.365
One lives over in Dalton.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.067
Let's go talk to him.
Yeah, tomorrow morning.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.903
Maybe he can give us
some answers.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.238
Hey, Gallo.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.841
Let's just make sure
we're on that rescue mission.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.748
I promised Jess.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.993
JIMMY:
How long has it been

11:00.027 --> 11:01.895
since we got
our hands free?

11:01.929 --> 11:03.396
I don't know.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.733
A day.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.736
Maybe more. It's hard
to keep track of time down here.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.972
That's a long time
to leave us alone.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.441
You think they know
what we're planning?

11:14.474 --> 11:17.244
How would they know?

11:17.277 --> 11:20.247
They heard us talking through
the walls? I don't know.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.482
I don't...
Hey, hey, hey.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.451
I need you squared, man.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.286
As soon as they come
through that door,

11:26.319 --> 11:27.855
we got to be ready to move.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.990
I'm good.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.862
Could be
any minute now.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.464
(dog barking in distance)

11:38.498 --> 11:40.467
Any minute.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.878
(panting)

11:50.911 --> 11:52.913
He's dead.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.184
I was trying to stop
him from shooting you.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.319
I didn't think. I just did it.
No, it's my fault.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.521
He was our mission commander.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.757
I disobeyed an order to move.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.359
Because he told us we were
getting a Somali insurgent.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.095
That was a lie.
(panting)

12:08.128 --> 12:10.764
He was using us to render
an American citizen.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.766
And it's illegal for the Army to
take action against Americans.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.235
I know. Look,
we can't stay here.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.805
The tangos will be coming
after us. We got to move,

12:17.838 --> 12:19.439
find a hide site,
contact Jimmy and the others.

12:19.472 --> 12:22.042
Okay, let's bring
his body. (groans)

12:22.075 --> 12:24.812
(panting)
I'm gonna have
to help you walk.

12:24.845 --> 12:25.512
I can't carry you both.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.514
We don't have time to bury him.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.917
You know what they do
to Americans.

12:31.852 --> 12:32.953
How about in there?

12:32.986 --> 12:34.822
We are not just
dumping him in a lake.

12:34.855 --> 12:35.789
(distant gunfire)

12:35.823 --> 12:36.957
That's close.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.526
We don't have a choice.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.429
(grunts)

12:46.266 --> 12:48.468
(panting)

12:48.501 --> 12:50.503
Hey.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.441
Oh.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.444
MADANI:
It's okay.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.813
It doesn't hurt anymore.

13:04.852 --> 13:07.520
(alarm tone playing)

13:09.356 --> 13:10.924
(sighs)
Sorry.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.026
What? No, no, no, no.
I got to go.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.494
You said you weren't working
until this afternoon.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.230
No.
I have a bunch
of errands to run.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.203
You know, it didn't
used to be like this.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.606
What is that supposed to mean?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.408
You're probably the strongest
person that I know.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.011
Nothing shakes you.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.579
But that last mission,
those six days

13:32.612 --> 13:34.181
that you were
lost out there,

13:34.214 --> 13:36.549
it seems like
something really did.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.920
(sighs)

13:39.953 --> 13:42.022
I just want you to
talk to me about it.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.024
And I did.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.593
No, there is something
that you're not saying.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.896
I am not doing this again.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.164
All right.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.200
(grunts)

13:53.233 --> 13:55.135
(sighs)

13:55.168 --> 13:57.570
(door closes)

14:08.615 --> 14:11.184
(drawer opens, closes)

14:11.218 --> 14:13.853
(lawnmower whirring)

14:16.656 --> 14:18.625
GALLO: We appreciate
your time, sir.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.494
JORDAN: Of course.
Davis Goundry was a good friend.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.931
You say this is
about a benefits claim?

14:23.964 --> 14:25.632
Yeah, we're doing an
internal investigation,

14:25.665 --> 14:27.901
making sure his family's
paid what they're due.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.569
Three years later.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.638
Can you tell us
how it happened that night?

14:31.671 --> 14:34.007
We were doing a HALO jump.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.642
25,000 feet.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.644
Heavy cloud cover.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.646
Goundry was the first to go.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.916
Then, mid-fall, he radios he's
got a parachute malfunction.

14:42.950 --> 14:45.385
After that,
we lost contact.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.920
There was a CIA team
on the ground

14:46.954 --> 14:48.155
that went looking
for him.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.990
One of them got a visual
on his body,

14:50.023 --> 14:51.624
smashed up in a tree line.

14:51.658 --> 14:54.627
They were in a TIC, taking fire,
so they couldn't recover him.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.663
Do you remember the
CIA officer's name

14:56.696 --> 14:58.932
who saw his body?
No.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.900
Would you recognize his face?

15:02.302 --> 15:05.105
JORDAN:
Yeah. That was him.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.679
So he faked his death
with Richard's help?

15:12.712 --> 15:15.182
As a way to create
a deep-black cover.

15:15.215 --> 15:18.451
I mean, I've heard rumors
about that kind of thing.
Yeah, but, then,

15:18.485 --> 15:21.088
why would Richard
want him dead a month ago?
I don't know.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.922
(ringtone playing)

15:25.025 --> 15:25.993
(phone clicks)

15:26.026 --> 15:28.261
I hope what
happened with us

15:28.295 --> 15:30.430
isn't part of that.
It's not.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.732
I owe you an
apology, though.

15:32.765 --> 15:36.136
I'm your C.O. I shouldn't
have crossed that line.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.437
We both did.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.372
Look, let's just forget
about it.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.941
We have bigger secrets
to worry about.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.013
Excuse me, ma'am.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.480
Do you have
a moment?

15:47.514 --> 15:49.282
For you, Lieutenant, always.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.118
Come on in. Actually,
I'm glad you're here.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.653
What does one wear
to a military ball?

15:53.686 --> 15:57.991
Uh... it's semiformal
for civilians, ma'am.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.660
Good. Good.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.996
What can I do for you?

16:03.030 --> 16:05.065
I did some research.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.733
The Puntland government

16:06.766 --> 16:08.468
runs a large refugee
camp outside of Bosaso.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.537
It's been hit by a
meningitis outbreak.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.372
They need antibiotics,

16:12.405 --> 16:14.307
but they can't get them
because it's too dangerous.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.609
Local bandits raid the
shipments and sell it

16:16.643 --> 16:17.444
on the black market.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.246
It's a lawless part
of the world.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.380
What is your point?

16:20.413 --> 16:22.049
The Shadow Raiders could fly in

16:22.082 --> 16:24.217
the antibiotic load,
a gesture of goodwill

16:24.251 --> 16:26.386
which we'd offer in exchange
for the government

16:26.419 --> 16:28.421
reopening
their airspace.

16:28.455 --> 16:31.124
And my guess is...

16:31.158 --> 16:33.426
they would take that deal.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.763
So you're not just
a pretty face.

16:36.796 --> 16:39.766
It's a good idea.
Colonel thought so as well.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.669
Uh, minus the "pretty face."

16:42.702 --> 16:43.736
(laughs)

16:43.770 --> 16:45.472
I'll run it by DC.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.407
Thank you, ma'am.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.708
While I have you here...

16:48.741 --> 16:50.777
The other day when
I asked about Ms. Madani

16:50.810 --> 16:53.146
and her exit logs from base,

16:53.180 --> 16:54.581
I realize that put you
in a tough position.

16:54.614 --> 16:55.648
You know,
I would have gone

16:55.682 --> 16:58.751
directly to her, but she
seems like someone who is

16:58.785 --> 17:01.088
very difficult to know.

17:01.121 --> 17:04.224
That is true of a lot of people
in our line of work.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.558
Yeah.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.760
And who doesn't love
a challenge?

17:07.794 --> 17:08.795
(chuckles softly)

17:13.800 --> 17:16.369
Okay, let's get
this practice run started.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.138
Engines.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.273
MADANI:
Set.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.408
You clipped in back there?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.277
Yep.

17:24.311 --> 17:27.514
Is all of the sergeant's
equipment secure?

17:27.547 --> 17:29.082
Yes, sir.

17:29.116 --> 17:32.352
MADANI:
Renegade One-Two.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.520
Adele's ready to fly.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.122
You named your helo Adele?

17:35.155 --> 17:37.590
It was between that
and Katy Perry.
Which reminds me,

17:37.624 --> 17:40.293
let's get some tunes up in here.

17:42.162 --> 17:45.465
(intro to "Set Forth"
by Tijuana Panthers plays)

17:54.741 --> 17:57.110
*

18:07.154 --> 18:08.621
GALLO:
Here we are.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.823
* New found pleasure

18:10.857 --> 18:12.825
* Set forth Sloane

18:12.859 --> 18:13.826
I have the controls.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.462
You have the controls.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.230
* Temporary measure

18:17.264 --> 18:20.200
* Set forth atone

18:20.233 --> 18:22.635
* She's on the phone

18:22.669 --> 18:24.871
* Cambridge wants her now

18:26.706 --> 18:28.175
* Calls the country home

18:29.942 --> 18:32.712
* She loathes the beach

18:32.745 --> 18:34.414
* Ooh... *

18:34.447 --> 18:36.483
* No progress

18:36.516 --> 18:37.650
* Ooh... *

18:37.684 --> 18:38.851
* Just regress

18:38.885 --> 18:39.919
* Ooh... *

18:39.952 --> 18:41.221
* Hey, nice dress

18:41.254 --> 18:42.755
* Ooh... *

18:42.789 --> 18:44.691
* When's recess?

18:44.724 --> 18:48.761
* Set forth,
couture's what she's made for *

18:48.795 --> 18:49.896
* Set forth Sloane

18:49.929 --> 18:51.531
You got to line me up.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.733
Okay, on this next one,
I need a 70-degree bank.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.903
It's not safe.
We're at the limit for power.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.738
Because of the load
you insisted on bringing.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.873
You know what, you're the
taxi drivers, I'm the customer.

19:00.907 --> 19:01.974
Your job's
to give me what I want.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.477
You don't do that, we're gonna
have a problem here.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.912
* Calls the country home

19:05.945 --> 19:07.580
I have the controls.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.848
* She loathes the beach

19:08.881 --> 19:10.317
You have the controls.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.286
* No progress

19:13.320 --> 19:14.754
* Ooh... *

19:14.787 --> 19:16.289
* Just regress...

19:16.323 --> 19:17.790
Pull me up!

19:17.824 --> 19:19.959
*

19:19.992 --> 19:21.628
Pull me up.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.595
(chuckling)

19:22.629 --> 19:24.697
Pull me up!

19:24.731 --> 19:26.866
What the hell is
wrong with you?

19:26.899 --> 19:29.202
Like she said: it's not safe.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.237
*

19:36.409 --> 19:37.744
I hope you got that
out of your system,

19:37.777 --> 19:39.579
because it didn't help things.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.582
I was proving a point--
it's too much weight.

19:42.615 --> 19:45.585
You didn't change his mind,
you just pissed him off more.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.754
All that matters now
is staying

19:47.787 --> 19:49.256
on the rescue mission.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.824
Sacrifice for the bigger
picture. Your words.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.460
Yep, okay.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.595
You're right.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.830
I bet that was hard
for you to say.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.600
But with this kind of weight,
only way we hit

20:00.633 --> 20:02.835
all those targets tomorrow
is going below 50 feet.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.537
Oh, so now you want
to piss off the colonel, too?

20:04.571 --> 20:06.273
A letter of reprimand
will get you flagged.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.874
That means no promotions
for years.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.776
Tomorrow we'll
follow the rules.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.944
And if you and Coogan manage
not to kill each other

20:11.978 --> 20:13.946
in the process,
then maybe we have a shot.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.582
Hey.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.317
Thought I'd find you here.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.785
(sighs)

20:19.786 --> 20:21.788
I'll catch you in a bit.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.358
Jonah Hex out.

20:27.794 --> 20:31.831
You two sure seem to have a lot
to talk about these days, huh?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.767
Yeah.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.771
Look... I feel like

20:38.805 --> 20:40.573
we didn't get a chance
to resolve things

20:40.607 --> 20:42.342
this morning.
Okay.

20:42.375 --> 20:45.578
We really don't have
to rehash it.
No. We do.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.480
There's something that
you are not telling me,

20:47.514 --> 20:48.748
Nora, and I want to know what.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.317
I am not doing this right now.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.751
Then you're gonna have
to do it sometime.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.954
Oh, am I? Or what?

20:54.987 --> 20:57.490
Please just stop riding
my ass about this.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.759
Nora.
(pants)

20:59.792 --> 21:02.362
You need to choose.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.864
Either you start trusting me...

21:04.897 --> 21:06.899
or we're done.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.472
You let me know when you decide.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.815
GALLO:
I need you to start trusting me.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.784
You're gonna be all right.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.753
That was my first kill.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.688
Yeah, you did it
to save me.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.623
If the CIA finds out

21:30.657 --> 21:33.460
we killed an officer
and let a prisoner go free,

21:33.493 --> 21:35.928
we're both going
to Leavenworth.

21:35.962 --> 21:39.932
"If they find out"?
What does that mean?

21:39.966 --> 21:42.435
There's another way.

21:45.605 --> 21:48.741
We say Richard
and the prisoner bailed...

21:48.775 --> 21:50.477
before we ditched.

21:50.510 --> 21:53.546
We don't know
what happened to 'em.

21:53.580 --> 21:57.584
Then we look for proof
this was an illegal mission.

21:57.617 --> 22:00.820
We find that, we come clean,

22:00.853 --> 22:02.522
and we keep our asses
out of prison.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.860
Lying goes against everything
we've been trained to do.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.430
So did pulling
that trigger.

22:13.833 --> 22:17.904
We couldn't tell anyone,
not even Ian.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.508
(quietly):
This is insane.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.644
We'd have to
do this together.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.079
It's your choice.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.887
All right, I'm here.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.656
And I wore my sneakers.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.057
Now, will you please
tell me why?

22:38.090 --> 22:40.660
You wanted to know how
Shadow Raiders deal with stuff,

22:40.693 --> 22:41.961
I'm gonna show you
one way.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.129
Put this on.
(Velcro tears)

22:43.162 --> 22:44.931
Used to be part
of our hazing.

22:44.964 --> 22:48.000
Every single morning,
when I first joined the unit.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.802
This is not light.
(chuckles)

22:49.836 --> 22:51.538
30 pounds, baby.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.039
"The torture run."

22:53.072 --> 22:54.874
I remember Jimmy
talking about that.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.843
By the end of it,
your lungs burn so much

22:56.876 --> 22:59.145
you want to die,
but upside is,

22:59.178 --> 23:00.747
guaranteed to clear your head.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.582
No talking required.

23:02.615 --> 23:03.916
Yeah.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.785
There was a whole world
in that "yeah."

23:05.818 --> 23:09.456
Ian wants me to talk.
I can't.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.924
All right,
you ready for this?

23:11.958 --> 23:15.928
Come on, we only have to
do it 25 times.

23:15.962 --> 23:16.996
Come on.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.799
* Mama, Mama, can't you see

23:19.832 --> 23:21.834
* Mama, Mama,
can't you see *

23:21.868 --> 23:23.970
* What the Army's
done to me? *

23:24.003 --> 23:26.105
* What the Army's
done to me? *

23:26.138 --> 23:28.941
* Put me in a
barber's chair *

23:28.975 --> 23:30.810
* Put me in
a barber's chair... *

23:30.843 --> 23:32.679
(footsteps approaching)

23:32.712 --> 23:34.714
(keys jingle)

23:34.747 --> 23:36.449
They're coming in.
They're coming in.

23:36.483 --> 23:38.851
This is it. Get your
hands behind your back.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.920
Don't move until I do.

23:42.522 --> 23:45.992
JIMMY (speaking Arabic):

23:50.663 --> 23:54.433
JIMMY (in English):
He's sick. He's sick.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.113
(gunshot)

24:08.648 --> 24:10.750
All right,
what about it?

24:10.783 --> 24:13.019
Um...
Somebody must have
heard that.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.955
We got to move fast.
Okay, get up, get up!

24:15.988 --> 24:17.690
You're our ticket out of here.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.767
JIMMY (speaking Arabic):

24:32.004 --> 24:34.974
Ah, here's the boss himself.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.153
No deal.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.926
You are worth more
to me alive,

24:53.960 --> 24:56.028
but if you do not
lay down the gun,

24:56.062 --> 24:57.029
we will kill you.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.101
We go down fighting.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.202
Screw it.
No!

25:03.235 --> 25:05.237
I have a family to get back to.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.574
I can't give up now.
Jimmy, no. No, no.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.775
(speaks Arabic)

25:08.808 --> 25:10.042
JIMMY:
No!

25:11.177 --> 25:12.712
(grunts)

25:30.162 --> 25:31.564
Raiders...

25:31.598 --> 25:35.301
Atten-hut!
Present arms!

25:37.604 --> 25:39.538
Shadow Raiders
formed, sir.

25:41.808 --> 25:43.643
Order, arms!

25:46.779 --> 25:48.047
It is my privilege to present

25:48.080 --> 25:49.649
the Honorable
Gregory Carter,

25:49.682 --> 25:51.150
Congressman of the
State of New York;

25:51.183 --> 25:54.053
the Honorable Jeremy
Slavitt, of Oklahoma;

25:54.086 --> 25:57.189
and the Honorable
Simone Porter, of Georgia.

25:59.759 --> 26:00.927
(jet passes overhead)

26:00.960 --> 26:03.262
Hello, son.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.900
(quietly):
Thought you knew.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.902
Wrong there.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.971
Nora.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.306
Good to see you.
Been too long.

26:14.340 --> 26:15.441
Ma'am.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.012
SIMONE: I'd like to say how
honored we are to be here.

26:20.046 --> 26:23.315
Operation Perseus is
very important to us.

26:23.349 --> 26:24.383
We need to bring our boys home.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.317
ALL:
Hooah!

26:25.351 --> 26:27.720
I look forward to
toasting your service

26:27.754 --> 26:29.021
at the ball tonight.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.824
But, in the meantime,

26:31.858 --> 26:33.159
let's see what you can do.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.927
(helicopter engine starting)

26:34.961 --> 26:36.996
I take it Ian's mom
isn't a fan.

26:37.029 --> 26:39.766
She has big plans for him.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.233
Wants him to run
for office someday,

26:41.267 --> 26:42.935
doesn't think I fit into that.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.704
That why you're
so tense?
I'm not tense.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.773
I call bull.

26:48.808 --> 26:52.111
Ian gave me an
ultimatum today.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.781
I tell him what
I'm hiding or...

26:54.814 --> 26:56.916
You'd be putting us
in a lot of danger, Madani.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.751
Him, too.

26:58.785 --> 27:02.655
*

27:10.697 --> 27:11.664
I asked to ride with you.

27:11.698 --> 27:12.932
Hope you don't mind.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.300
Glad to have you, ma'am.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.002
SIMONE: You should know,
if it weren't for Ian,

27:16.035 --> 27:17.436
we would have already
put another battalion

27:17.469 --> 27:18.771
on the rescue operation.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.339
HASKINS:
Well, let's show her

27:20.372 --> 27:21.407
what Shadow Raiders can do.

27:30.717 --> 27:32.418
COOGAN: Ma'am,
would you like me to explain

27:32.451 --> 27:34.721
what's about to happen here?
SIMONE: Please.

27:34.754 --> 27:35.788
All right, Sergeant Darzi and I,

27:35.822 --> 27:37.890
we're gonna be shooting
at a series of oil drums.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.391
There is fuel in them today,

27:39.425 --> 27:41.227
so they should make
some nice flames.

27:41.260 --> 27:44.697
And it's these pilots' job to
get us lined up for the shots.

27:44.731 --> 27:46.032
If they do, you should get
a nice show.

27:46.065 --> 27:49.736
If not, well,
my apologies in advance.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.044
Let me take this one.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.913
You have the controls.
I have the controls.

28:00.947 --> 28:02.448
Here we are.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.835
SIMONE:
Nicely done, pilot.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.103
And you weren't kidding
about those flames.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.350
COMPUTER VOICE:
Low rotor. Low rotor. Low...

28:38.384 --> 28:40.486
Low rotor RPM.
We don't have the torque.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.321
Can't do it.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.795
I have the controls.
You have the controls.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.835
Don't go below 50.

28:57.870 --> 29:01.173
GALLO: We can't be taken
off the mission.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.449
Take your shot, Sergeant.

29:20.392 --> 29:23.095
Damn!
Well done.

29:23.129 --> 29:25.231
All of you.
It's gonna be an honor

29:25.264 --> 29:27.333
to have you on
Operation Perseus.

29:33.906 --> 29:35.274
The colonel looks like
he's about to kill someone.

29:35.307 --> 29:38.077
Yeah, that someone would be me.

29:46.152 --> 29:48.187
*

29:50.556 --> 29:52.524
* I got nothin'

29:52.558 --> 29:54.193
* I got nothin' to lose

29:54.226 --> 29:55.962
* Time is running out

29:55.995 --> 29:57.964
* And I'm rolling through

29:57.997 --> 30:00.399
* And I'm comin',
I'm comin' for you *

30:00.432 --> 30:04.470
* With a hot head
and a bad attitude *

30:04.503 --> 30:08.374
* I wanna take a walk
in the wild *

30:08.407 --> 30:12.411
* I wanna feel
our hearts collide *

30:12.444 --> 30:14.981
* I wanna feel alive

30:17.516 --> 30:21.387
* I wanna take a walk
in the wild *

30:21.420 --> 30:25.892
* I wanna feel
our hearts collide *

30:25.925 --> 30:28.527
* I wanna feel alive

30:28.560 --> 30:30.562
* Ooh...

30:32.298 --> 30:34.266
* Ooh...

30:35.534 --> 30:37.503
* Ooh...

30:38.570 --> 30:40.439
* Ooh, ooh

30:42.541 --> 30:45.444
* Come bloody,
I got room for two *

30:45.477 --> 30:49.081
* There's only one thing
that's left to do *

30:49.115 --> 30:52.518
* Hold steady,
I've had my eye on you *

30:52.551 --> 30:55.955
* I'm coming back at you
like déjà vu *

30:59.158 --> 31:03.595
* I wanna take a walk
in the wild *

31:03.629 --> 31:06.532
* I wanna feel
our hearts collide... *

31:06.565 --> 31:08.500
Where's Lieutenant Porter?

31:08.534 --> 31:10.036
Would have thought
you guys came together.

31:10.069 --> 31:11.938
He's escorting his mother.

31:11.971 --> 31:13.539
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.007
* I wanna take a walk
in the wild... *

31:15.041 --> 31:16.508
You know,
you're very impressive to me,

31:16.542 --> 31:18.010
Ms. Madani.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.412
I thought my agency felt male.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.081
But it's nothing like your unit.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.649
I'm sure we've dealt
with a lot of the same.

31:23.682 --> 31:24.883
We have.

31:24.917 --> 31:28.254
You know, I had to fight really
hard to run this operation.

31:28.287 --> 31:30.522
It's personal to me.
Richard was a mentor of mine.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.224
I want to know
what happened to him.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.459
We all do, ma'am.

31:35.294 --> 31:37.629
(phone rings)

31:37.663 --> 31:39.665
I'm sorry, I have to take this.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.535
Nora.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.571
Hey, Jess. Oh, look at you.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.473
You look beautiful.
Thank you. So do you.

31:47.506 --> 31:48.975
Look at this guy.

31:49.008 --> 31:51.410
Mm-hmm.
An officer and a gentleman.

31:51.443 --> 31:52.578
Couldn't quite go clean, huh?

31:52.611 --> 31:54.246
Heck, I worked hard
to be in Spec Ops.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.483
Got to enjoy these perks
where I can, right?

31:57.516 --> 31:59.685
Jess told me you made
her do the torture run.

31:59.718 --> 32:01.553
And she did great.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.123
Yeah, and now I can hardly walk.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.291
(chuckles)

32:05.324 --> 32:06.525
But it did make me realize

32:06.558 --> 32:08.194
how different it is
for you guys.

32:08.227 --> 32:09.395
I mean,

32:09.428 --> 32:10.963
you train together,

32:10.997 --> 32:12.298
you deploy together.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.166
But us here at home, waiting?

32:14.200 --> 32:15.667
We do that alone.

32:15.701 --> 32:18.670
Well, not quite alone.

32:21.673 --> 32:22.975
Good luck.
Thanks.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.110
Go get them.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.015
It's good to see her
smiling like that again.

32:29.048 --> 32:31.517
Yeah.
Hey, how'd the talk
go with the colonel?

32:32.651 --> 32:34.053
Kept his promise.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.354
Letter of reprimand.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.156
Well, you went
below 50 feet.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.224
You knew what you were doing.

32:38.257 --> 32:39.258
Yep.
Mm-hmm.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.693
I took your advice.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.095
Sacrifice,

32:43.129 --> 32:44.696
blah, blah, blah.

32:44.730 --> 32:45.697
It worked.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.233
We're on the rescue mission.

32:50.102 --> 32:52.671
Coogan looks thrilled
about it.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.745
GALLO: You know that girl
we fought over?

32:59.778 --> 33:01.713
I really fell for her.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.184
Um...

33:05.217 --> 33:08.354
She was an Army nurse.

33:08.387 --> 33:09.988
Died in Kandahar.

33:12.758 --> 33:15.194
(clears throat)

33:16.595 --> 33:18.330
* Here I am

33:18.364 --> 33:21.033
* Sandwiched between heaven...

33:21.067 --> 33:22.601
SIMONE:
Your girlfriend is quite

33:22.634 --> 33:24.203
a pilot.

33:24.236 --> 33:25.371
Even I could
tell that today.

33:25.404 --> 33:26.605
No crap.

33:26.638 --> 33:30.376
She wouldn't
be here otherwise.

33:30.409 --> 33:33.512
I was trying to
say something nice.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.382
Well, it shouldn't
be so hard, Mom.

33:36.415 --> 33:39.451
She has a very handsome partner.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.287
Nice thing number two.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.190
* I used to ask life
to kill me slowly *

33:44.223 --> 33:46.592
* But now I beg you.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.594
I have been looking for you.

33:48.627 --> 33:49.661
You remember Anna.

33:49.695 --> 33:50.762
Works at the archives.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.531
How could I forget?

33:52.564 --> 33:54.600
Uh, if you'll excuse me,
I think I just

33:54.633 --> 33:55.701
saw my date walk in.
Oh.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.069
I need to talk to you both.

33:58.770 --> 34:01.173
Two suits came by
my office today,

34:01.207 --> 34:03.642
wanting to know what records
you've been asking for.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.244
I mean, I made
something up,

34:05.277 --> 34:07.246
but I don't think
they bought it.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.714
I think they were CIA.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.716
You told me

34:10.749 --> 34:12.318
you were researching
for a benefits claim.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.253
That's right.
(scoffs) Yeah?

34:14.286 --> 34:17.789
Well, definitely
don't believe that anymore.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.825
(stammers, sighs)

34:25.664 --> 34:29.635
How does the agency even
know we went to her?

34:29.668 --> 34:32.138
They're not only checking
our exit logs.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.708
They're watching us.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.347
(panting)

34:41.380 --> 34:43.815
(whispers):
Damn it.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.817
Too much water got in.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.353
(panting)

34:47.386 --> 34:48.654
You get the wound clear?

34:48.687 --> 34:50.656
I think... yeah.

34:50.689 --> 34:51.723
Bullet went all the way through.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.192
That's good.

34:53.225 --> 34:54.693
Less chance of infection.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.262
(Madani grunting)

34:56.295 --> 34:57.296
Let me do it.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.331
(grunting):
I got it.

35:01.867 --> 35:03.469
Talk to me.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.437
Distract me.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.206
How about some 20 Questions?

35:07.239 --> 35:10.276
(laughs)
You freaking love that game.

35:10.309 --> 35:14.446
I want you to guess what the
prisoner dropped when he ran.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.714
He dropped something?

35:16.782 --> 35:18.284
What?
Nope.

35:18.317 --> 35:20.552
Not how you play.
Oh, Gallo, just tell me!

35:22.888 --> 35:24.890
That's a thousand U.S. dollars.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.858
And inside...

35:28.627 --> 35:29.861
...a domino.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.899
I got no idea
what that's about.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.302
All right.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.936
Hold still.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.905
(screaming)

35:39.938 --> 35:41.740
You're good.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.876
You're good.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.878
(sighs)

35:46.912 --> 35:49.848
(panting)

35:49.881 --> 35:51.917
I used to think
that doing my duty

35:51.950 --> 35:54.886
was the same
as doing what was right.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.523
Made things easy.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.929
I guess now it's up to us
to decide.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.572
I've made my decision.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.474
(speaking indistinctly)

36:15.507 --> 36:17.909
I'm giving Ian an answer.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.787
*

36:32.824 --> 36:34.226
Look.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.498
I've been thinking
about what you said,

36:39.531 --> 36:42.401
and you're right.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.903
You deserve to know the truth.

36:44.936 --> 36:46.905
All of it.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.840
I'm ready.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.812
I've been visiting Gallo
outside of work.

36:53.845 --> 36:56.915
We've been struggling
with what we went through,

36:56.948 --> 36:59.385
and we nearly died out there.

36:59.418 --> 37:03.355
So we've been talking
through it with each other.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.624
I knew it wasn't kosher
to be fraternizing that way,

37:05.657 --> 37:06.925
so I didn't tell you.

37:06.958 --> 37:09.461
You're talking. That's it?

37:09.495 --> 37:11.330
Yes.

37:15.033 --> 37:18.804
I am the one
that you should be talking to.

37:18.837 --> 37:22.441
I know.

37:22.474 --> 37:25.844
And from now on, I will.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.923
Okay.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.858
Come on.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.360
Dance floor ain't
getting any younger.

37:41.393 --> 37:43.395
(laughs)
What does that even mean?

37:44.996 --> 37:47.333
* Got to learn
what that door is for *

37:47.366 --> 37:49.868
* Got to learn what
that door is for *

37:49.901 --> 37:51.837
* Got to learn
what that door is for *

37:51.870 --> 37:55.006
* Got to learn what
that door is for *

37:55.040 --> 37:57.843
* Well, you know I'd walk
a mile just to die *

37:57.876 --> 38:00.312
* Die, die, die, die

38:00.346 --> 38:03.315
* Bad luck coming up,
good luck is gone... *

38:03.349 --> 38:04.716
Bourbon.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.352
Double shot.
There you are.

38:06.385 --> 38:10.055
* Bad luck coming up,
good luck is gone *

38:10.088 --> 38:13.291
* And the mile that I speak of
is the one I'm on *

38:15.827 --> 38:17.963
* Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, Tommy

38:17.996 --> 38:20.832
* Joey, Johnny,
Dee Dee, Tommy *

38:20.866 --> 38:23.602
* Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, Tommy

38:23.635 --> 38:25.604
* Joey, Johnny,
Dee Dee, Tommy *

38:25.637 --> 38:27.406
* They were all my friends.

38:27.439 --> 38:28.907
(tapping glass)

38:28.940 --> 38:30.742
Shadow Raiders.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.511
The Honorable Simone Porter
is going to lead us

38:32.544 --> 38:34.813
in tonight's
Missing Man Ceremony.

38:34.846 --> 38:37.783
SIMONE: This table,
set here in a place of honor,

38:37.816 --> 38:40.686
symbolizes our missing
and fallen comrades.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.954
The seat is empty
because they're gone.

38:42.988 --> 38:46.425
The glass is overturned because
they cannot drink with us.

38:46.458 --> 38:48.994
And the single candle
represents the hope

38:49.027 --> 38:51.463
they'll make their way home
to our arms.

38:51.497 --> 38:55.534
Until they do, we take solace
in the community here tonight,

38:55.567 --> 38:58.504
and we raise a glass together
for their speedy return.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.015
(phone beeping)

39:10.048 --> 39:12.651
(phones beeping, chiming)

39:14.453 --> 39:16.422
(crowd murmuring)

39:16.455 --> 39:17.956
(phones continue chiming)

39:28.600 --> 39:31.102
Jess.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.138
I know. You can't
tell me anything.

39:40.145 --> 39:42.748
I guess
I'm heading home now.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.583
(sniffles)
Okay.
See you soon?

39:44.616 --> 39:47.486
Yeah.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.087
(sniffles)
You know what?

39:49.120 --> 39:50.956
I'll actually see you
guys at group next week.

39:50.989 --> 39:53.191
You decided to come?

39:53.224 --> 39:54.493
Yeah, it's worth
a shot, right?

39:54.526 --> 39:56.127
(chuckles softly)

39:56.161 --> 39:58.163
Hooah.

40:03.469 --> 40:05.471
THEA:
Thank you for coming.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.674
I called this emergency briefing
for two reasons.

40:08.707 --> 40:11.176
The first is that we have
a mission to start planning.

40:11.209 --> 40:13.479
The Puntland government has
agreed to reopen their airspace

40:13.512 --> 40:15.013
once we do
a little something for them.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.849
We will be flying a load of
antibiotics into a refugee camp.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.785
Now, it's an
unstable area,

40:19.818 --> 40:21.186
and it is likely
that you will encounter

40:21.219 --> 40:23.789
armed resistance.
A successful drop

40:23.822 --> 40:25.924
will not only save lives,
but it will be the next step

40:25.957 --> 40:27.793
in bringing back
Sergeants Kam and Hendrix.

40:27.826 --> 40:28.760
THEA: Now, for
the second thing.

40:28.794 --> 40:30.862
We received a video
tonight, sent through

40:30.896 --> 40:32.631
an anonymous
file-sharing service.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.666
I wanted you to see it
immediately.

40:36.702 --> 40:38.970
My name is Khalid Samatar.

40:39.004 --> 40:40.806
I am the man
who has your soldiers.

40:40.839 --> 40:45.644
I will release them in exchange
for 50 ISIS prisoners

40:45.677 --> 40:47.112
held by U.S. forces.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.814
Their names
will be shown at the end

40:48.847 --> 40:50.148
of this video, with instructions

40:50.181 --> 40:52.918
on how to make the trade.

40:54.586 --> 40:57.756
You have ten days
to meet my demands.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.558
Goundry had a domino, too.

40:59.591 --> 41:00.859
MADANI:
That's not coincidence.

41:00.892 --> 41:03.194
KHALID:
If you do not, they will die.

41:04.863 --> 41:06.064
And I will send the video

41:06.097 --> 41:08.133
for the world to see.
