<i>OLDER TED; When your Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>was 10 years old,</i>

00:18.051 --> 00:20.383
<i>he read a book called</i>
Life Among The Gorillas.

00:20.954 --> 00:25.550
<i>It was written by an anthropologist</i>
<i>named Dr, Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez,</i>

00:25.658 --> 00:27.353
<i>and it told the story of the year she spent</i>

00:27.460 --> 00:30.896
<i>living among the western lowland gorillas</i>
<i>of Cameroon,</i>

00:31.131 --> 00:32.928
<i>When Dr, Birnholz-Vazquez</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:35.593
<i>came to the local community college</i>
<i>to give a lecture,</i>

00:35.702 --> 00:37.795
<i>Marshall, the youngest member</i>
<i>of the audience,</i>

00:37.904 --> 00:39.895
<i>raised his hand with a question,</i>

00:40.507 --> 00:43.533
What advice do you have
for a budding anthropologist?

00:43.643 --> 00:45.440
So, you want to be an anthropologist?

00:45.545 --> 00:49.037
Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live
with the gorillas just like you did.

00:49.149 --> 00:51.743
<i>OLDER TED; What she said next</i>
<i>changed his life,</i>

00:51.851 --> 00:54.911
Oh, that's wonderful,
but I'm afraid you can't.

00:55.155 --> 00:57.248
They'll all be dead by then.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.953
And if economic sanctions
and trade restrictions aren't enforced,

01:03.063 --> 01:04.928
the destruction of the rainforests
will continue,

01:05.031 --> 01:07.966
and over a million species
will be wiped out.

01:08.168 --> 01:09.726
So you don't want coffee?

01:09.836 --> 01:12.361
I'm saying that the coffee industry
is causing irreversible...

01:12.472 --> 01:15.032
- All right, I'm pouring it out.
- Okay, one cup.

01:15.141 --> 01:18.133
Kid needs to be alert.
First day on the job and everything.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.474
Still can't believe you're going
all corporate on us.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.639
The Kid has become the man.

01:23.116 --> 01:25.414
Okay, it's just an internship
to make a little money.

01:25.518 --> 01:28.043
After law school,
I'm still gonna work for the NRDC.

01:28.154 --> 01:29.849
They're gonna stop global warming.

01:29.956 --> 01:32.356
<i>OLDER TED; Well, I mean,</i>
<i>they did their best,</i>

01:33.526 --> 01:34.823
Here's your sack lunch.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.088
(CHUCKLING)

01:36.296 --> 01:39.060
Okay. I love you because, one,
you made me a sack lunch,

01:39.165 --> 01:41.156
and, two, you laugh
every time you say the word "sack."

01:41.267 --> 01:42.291
(CHUCKLES)

01:42.402 --> 01:45.064
- I love you, Marshmallow.
- I love you.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.332
TED: I love you, too, Marshmallow.

01:49.209 --> 01:50.369
Uh-oh.

01:50.743 --> 01:53.211
- Ted?
- Oh, no!

01:53.413 --> 01:56.177
- No, she didn't.
- Yeah. Yeah, she did.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.479
Another care package?

01:58.685 --> 02:00.243
<i>OLDER TED; Another care package,</i>

02:00.353 --> 02:04.221
<i>I'd been in a long-distance relationship</i>
<i>with Victoria for nearly a month,</i>

02:04.324 --> 02:07.452
<i>Long-distance relationships are a bad idea,</i>

02:08.828 --> 02:10.818
- How many is that so far?
- Three.

02:10.930 --> 02:13.364
And how many have you sent her?

02:13.566 --> 02:16.126
In the mail or in my mind? Zero.

02:16.402 --> 02:17.835
She's up three-zip.

02:17.937 --> 02:20.371
Oh! Cupcakes. Great.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.002
I bet they're delicious, too.

02:23.776 --> 02:25.744
Yeah. They're delicious.

02:26.246 --> 02:27.474
Damn it!

02:29.315 --> 02:32.113
I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.647
God, I hate myself right now.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.390
God, that is so me at 15.

02:41.127 --> 02:44.654
<i>OLDER TED; Marshall was going to work</i>
<i>for a big corporation called Altrucel,</i>

02:44.764 --> 02:47.562
<i>Altrucel was most well-known</i>
<i>for making the yellow fuzzy stuff</i>

02:47.667 --> 02:49.157
<i>on the surface of tennis balls,</i>

02:49.269 --> 02:52.466
<i>I mean, this was a huge company,</i>
<i>so they did other things,</i>

02:54.941 --> 02:58.274
<i>But mostly, they wanted the public</i>
<i>to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff,</i>

02:58.378 --> 03:01.575
<i>Anyway, Marshall managed to score</i>
<i>an internship in their legal department</i>

03:01.681 --> 03:03.308

<i>Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports</i>

- A Sasquatch?
<i>- That's right, sir, A Bigfoot,</i>

03:16.763 --> 03:20.699
<i>We don't want to alarm you,</i>

03:25.905 --> 03:28.601
Yes! Look at you.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.472
You're suited in an unmistakably
upward direction.

03:31.578 --> 03:35.105
Whoa! That is a butt-Ioad
of motivational posters.

03:35.215 --> 03:39.208
Yeah. Hell, yeah. I got them all.
"Teamwork, courage, awesomeness."

03:39.552 --> 03:42.680
- There's one for awesomeness?
- Yeah. I had it made.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.984
- Sit.
- Hey, so, now that I'm working here,

03:45.091 --> 03:46.956
are you finally gonna tell me
exactly what your job is?

03:47.060 --> 03:48.721
(LAUGHING) Please.

03:48.828 --> 03:50.625
- My dawg!
- My dawg!

03:50.730 --> 03:53.255
Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall.
These guys are in legal.

03:53.366 --> 03:54.526
You're gonna be working with them.

03:54.634 --> 03:55.862
Marshall Eriksen. Nice to meet you.

03:55.969 --> 04:00.065
- Nice tie. Steak sauce.
- Oh, steak sauce. For true, though.

04:00.173 --> 04:03.142
- Where? I don't see any...
- Marshall, sidebar.

04:05.778 --> 04:10.272
Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1.
A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.

04:11.017 --> 04:14.714
Okay, Eriksen. Let's get to work.
It's 2:00 a.m. It's raining outside.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.516
Ding-dong. What? The doorbell?

04:16.623 --> 04:20.059
Oh, hello, Jessica Alba,
in a trench coat and nothing else.

04:20.159 --> 04:22.855
But wait. Knock, knock.
Somebody's at the back door?

04:22.962 --> 04:24.862
- I don't have a back door, so...
- Oh, my gosh.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.364
Jessica Simpson? What a surprise.

04:27.467 --> 04:31.233
Two Jessicas. You gotta pick one.
What do you do? Go.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.103
Right, well, I'm engaged, so...

04:34.207 --> 04:37.005
Fiancée's out of town.
What do you do? Go!

04:37.777 --> 04:39.267
We're still engaged, even if she's out...

04:39.379 --> 04:42.837
Okay, fiancée's dead. Hit by a bus.
What do you do? Go.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.549
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

04:47.987 --> 04:50.717
- Sure you don't want one?
- How many of those have you eaten?

04:50.823 --> 04:52.552
Fourteen.

04:52.659 --> 04:53.990
No. Just four.

04:54.093 --> 04:56.220
- And the icing from two more.
- Mmm.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.961
So, anyway. Here's the problem.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.228
Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep.

05:01.334 --> 05:05.293
Anyway, I got the care package
and it's just great.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.539
Here, listen.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.268
(MOANING IN SATISFACTION)

05:10.510 --> 05:11.807
So, I'm standing there,

05:11.911 --> 05:15.574
my mouth full of this delicious,
relationship-winning cupcake,

05:16.749 --> 05:18.740
and I said something dumb.

05:19.319 --> 05:23.619
Oh, and don't worry. Yours is in the mail.
I sent it a couple days ago.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.982
And it's awesome. Really, really awesome.

05:27.527 --> 05:31.429
Why did I say that?
I think frosting makes me lie.

05:32.765 --> 05:34.096
Oh, Teddy boy.

05:34.200 --> 05:38.534
Yeah. So now, whatever I send her,
she'll know I sent it after I talked to her.

05:38.638 --> 05:42.836
So, that's the problem. You work on that.
I'm gonna eat this cupcake.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.135
All right, here's what you do.

05:45.244 --> 05:47.906
Put together a care package of stuff
from New York.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.074
Some H&H Bagels,
an Empire State Building key chain,

05:51.184 --> 05:54.483
and then, top off the package
with a <i>New York Times,</i> ready?

05:54.587 --> 05:56.316
From three days ago.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.523
- That's brilliant.
- Mmm.

05:58.624 --> 05:59.716
You're brilliant.

06:00.727 --> 06:02.285
You know, it's funny, not so long ago,

06:02.395 --> 06:05.694
I was coming to Marshall and Lily
for advice on how to impress you.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.322
That is funny.

06:07.433 --> 06:08.866
<i>OLDER TED; And here's why it was funny,</i>

06:08.968 --> 06:11.368
<i>Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier,</i>

06:11.471 --> 06:14.133
<i>here's what Robin was saying to Lily</i>
<i>about me,</i>

06:14.273 --> 06:16.366
Okay, fine! I have feelings for him.

06:17.343 --> 06:20.779
Now, it's ironic the girl I used to like
is helping me impress the girl I now like.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.814
The irony is clear, Ted.

06:25.718 --> 06:30.246
- Hey! How was your first day?
- I don't want to talk about it.

06:32.925 --> 06:35.416
The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.086
- What?
- They're jerks.

06:37.196 --> 06:41.428
- Well, what makes them jerks?
- Forget it. I don't want to talk about it.

06:41.534 --> 06:43.195
Well, like today at lunch.

06:45.304 --> 06:47.329
What you got there, Eriksen?
Mommy pack your lunch?

06:47.440 --> 06:48.464
(LAUGHING)

06:48.574 --> 06:50.439
For your information, my fiancée did.

06:50.543 --> 06:53.376
Oh! Does she cut the crusts
off your sandwich, too?

06:53.479 --> 06:54.503
(BILSON LAUGHING)

06:54.614 --> 06:55.774
No.

07:02.655 --> 07:05.852
- What's that?
- Nothing. Give it!

07:05.958 --> 07:09.621
"Dear Marshmallow, good luck today.
I love you! Lilypad."

07:09.729 --> 07:10.889
Give it!

07:10.997 --> 07:15.661
"P.S. If you've unfolded this note,
your kiss already got out. Quick, catch it!"

07:15.768 --> 07:18.760
Give it back! Hey, give it! Give me!
Give it!

07:19.272 --> 07:22.708
- Oh, screw those guys. We're adorable.
- I know.

07:22.809 --> 07:25.676
God! It's like freshman year, all over again.

07:25.778 --> 07:29.407
Only, this time, my sweet dance moves
aren't gonna be enough to win them over.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.346
Not even Old Reliable.

07:36.255 --> 07:39.884
Sweetie, it would be cool
to have some extra money,

07:39.992 --> 07:42.688
but if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.957
- I quit.
- What? No. You...

07:46.065 --> 07:49.432
We're having so much fun.
You, me, working together. It's great.

07:49.535 --> 07:52.971
We're not even working together, Barney.
I'm in the legal department and you're...

07:53.072 --> 07:56.007
- Seriously, what is it that you do?
- Please.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.839
I'm sorry. Dude, this corporate thing,
it's just... It's not for me.

08:00.947 --> 08:03.074
No, of course it's not for you.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.383
It's for Lily.

08:06.452 --> 08:09.285
- What?
- Marshall, Lily's a catch.

08:09.388 --> 08:12.016
But do you really think you're gonna
hang on to a girl that great

08:12.124 --> 08:14.115
- without the package?
- The package?

08:14.227 --> 08:17.594
The package. The house, the car,
sending your kids to a great school.

08:17.697 --> 08:21.155
- A vacation once in a while.
- Lily doesn't care about that stuff.

08:21.267 --> 08:23.326
Well, no. Now she doesn't.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.097
But how's she gonna feel
in a couple of years

08:25.204 --> 08:27.968
when she's supporting you
on a kindergarten-teacher's salary,

08:28.074 --> 08:29.598
while you're off in court,

08:29.709 --> 08:34.442
defending some endangered
South American flying beaver.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.142
I know.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.643
- She'll be happy.
- Okay.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.416
But will you be happy,

08:43.523 --> 08:46.515
knowing you could have
made her a lot happier?

08:48.728 --> 08:52.095
And all four are totally naked.
You gotta choose one.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.927
What do you do? Go.

09:08.981 --> 09:11.313
So, did she get
the awesome care package, yet?

09:11.417 --> 09:12.714
Yep. Yesterday.

09:12.818 --> 09:15.753
- Did she love it?
- Oh, she loved it.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.755
So, what's the problem?

09:17.857 --> 09:20.417
So, I was talking to her last night,
and I should tell you,

09:20.526 --> 09:22.118
we've been talking on the phone
every other night,

09:22.228 --> 09:25.629
for, like, an hour and a half.
Eventually, you just run out of stuff to say.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.267
What did you have for lunch today?

09:30.536 --> 09:31.560
Mmm-hmm.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.161
Oh, rye bread.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.101
Oh.

09:37.009 --> 09:38.033
(SIGHING)

09:38.144 --> 09:39.304
Mmm-hmm.

09:40.780 --> 09:41.838
Yeah.

09:42.548 --> 09:43.708
Mmm.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.279
Oh, Teddy boy.

09:50.489 --> 09:52.320
I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend,

09:52.425 --> 09:54.723
but this never-seeing-each-other thing,
it's a bitch.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.988
Maybe it just can't be done.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.621
I think it's clear what I have to do.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.359
It's pretty clear.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.898
I have to go to Germany and surprise her.

10:05.004 --> 10:09.100
Totally what I was thinking.
Get out of my head, man.

10:13.512 --> 10:15.980
Barney, how do I get these idiots
to leave me alone?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.782
Marshall, consider the penguins.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.813
- The penguins?
- On the wall.

10:28.160 --> 10:32.187
"Conformity. It's the one who's different
that gets left out in the cold."

10:32.298 --> 10:34.095
This is a motivational poster?

10:34.200 --> 10:36.191
Look at yourself, Marshall.
You're not happy.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.271
And you know why?
Because you're different.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.704
Now, I suppose you could learn
to love yourself

10:41.807 --> 10:44.401
for the unique little snowflake
that you are.

10:44.510 --> 10:47.001
Or you could change
your entire personality,

10:47.113 --> 10:49.513
which is just so much easier.

10:50.216 --> 10:54.949
Change your personality? That is so awful.
And not at all motivational.

10:55.054 --> 10:57.852
Not necessarily.
Okay, at first, I was appalled.

10:57.957 --> 10:59.185
But then I realized

10:59.291 --> 11:03.091
it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez

11:03.195 --> 11:05.425
No, I have to gain the acceptance
of the herd

11:05.531 --> 11:07.726
by behaving exactly like one of them.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.666
It's an anthropological study.
Isn't that cool?

11:10.770 --> 11:12.863
Well, it sounds kind of like peer pressure.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.998
No, no, no. It's totally anthropological.

11:16.108 --> 11:18.338
And it's cool. And I'm doing it.

11:18.444 --> 11:22.881
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure.
We have an assembly every year.

11:22.982 --> 11:26.577
I'm portraying someone
who succumbs to peer pressure.

11:26.819 --> 11:28.013
All right.

to smoke, what do you say?

- Only when I'm drunk.
- Good boy.

Oh, I am. I'm psyched.

11:50.576 --> 11:54.603
Yeah, but it's one thing to say it.
It's another thing to show it.

12:21.707 --> 12:25.609

- Show me you're psyched!

12:39.692 --> 12:40.818

12:40.926 --> 12:43.724

- Cool. And what guy is this?

12:44.497 --> 12:47.796

"Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs!"

13:05.985 --> 13:08.249
So, I'm like, "A-snappa-doo!"

13:08.354 --> 13:10.822
So we find this choice nudie nest
near the airport.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.915
And that is when the bouncer
kicked us out.
