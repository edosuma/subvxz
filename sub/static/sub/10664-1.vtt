00:15.348 --> 00:17.917
I had the world by the balls

00:18.284 --> 00:19.919
Want details?

00:21.588 --> 00:25.925
Okay. I had more money
than I knew what to do with.

00:27.560 --> 00:31.965
A respected lawyer. In demand.

00:32.432 --> 00:36.301
And my wife. Was beautiful.

00:36.302 --> 00:40.440
From a wealthy family of timber
barons.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.475
And then...

00:42.742 --> 00:45.711
I threw it all away.

00:45.712 --> 00:49.515
Honey, please, put the gun down.

00:49.516 --> 00:50.916
Who is she?

00:50.917 --> 00:52.419
There's no one.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.788
Is it that bitch Sandy again?

00:55.789 --> 00:57.356
I don't know what you're talking
about.

00:57.357 --> 01:00.560
Is she good in the sack, Brooks?

01:00.794 --> 01:05.831
I'm gonna call, Doctor Nessbaum,
Okay?

01:05.832 --> 01:08.001
Is she young?

01:09.536 --> 01:12.337
We're gonna talk this through.

01:12.338 --> 01:16.708
You, me, and Dr. Nessbaum.

01:16.709 --> 01:20.346
Is that why you're leaving me
again this weekend?

01:22.215 --> 01:25.652
Give me the gun.

01:33.893 --> 01:35.494
Where'd you get this thing?

01:35.495 --> 01:37.564
It's not loaded.

01:40.834 --> 01:45.038
Have you been taking your
medication?

01:45.972 --> 01:48.240
You're not gonna tell the doctor
are you?

01:48.241 --> 01:50.643
What, that you threatened to
kill me again?

01:52.645 --> 01:55.514
Whose the woman you're meeting
this weekend, huh Brooks?

01:55.515 --> 01:59.351
Amanda we've been through this a
dozen times.

01:59.352 --> 02:01.954
I'm doing work for an out of
town client. I don't like

02:01.955 --> 02:03.655
these weekends away anymore than
you do.

02:03.656 --> 02:05.558
Then take me with you.

02:06.626 --> 02:10.395
You know I can't do that.

02:10.395 --> 02:12.565
I don't believe you.

02:20.607 --> 02:21.840
I'll see you Sunday evening.

02:21.841 --> 02:23.909
Brooks darling, please don't
leave me...

02:23.910 --> 02:25.778
I have to go.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.784
I'm glad I didn't shoot you
Brooks.

02:32.385 --> 02:34.553
Me too.

02:34.554 --> 02:37.624
It would've been far too
lenient.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.393
Adulterers like you should be
stoned to death like they

02:41.394 --> 02:43.562
do in the Middle East.

02:43.563 --> 02:47.499
You know why don't you, um,
why don't you hold that thought.

02:47.500 --> 02:52.705
And we'll discuss it when I get
back, 'Kay?

02:54.874 --> 02:58.544
You're not the only ones with
plans this weekend Brooks.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.647
I have a few plans myself.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.958
So professor, what you're saying
is that there is such a thing as

03:12.959 --> 03:16.328
divine reciprocity or karma if
you will, and that we all get

03:16.329 --> 03:18.397
our just deserts in the end.

03:18.398 --> 03:20.799
I don't know if it's divinely
inspired or not,

03:20.800 --> 03:24.403
we now have scientific evidence
supporting the idea of what goes

03:24.404 --> 03:25.637
around comes around.

Hey Leonard, It's Brooks
Caldwell here, um, I'm calling

03:32.679 --> 03:37.082
about Amanda - seems she stopped
taking her medications again.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.818
Could you give me a call as soon
as you get this, I'm on my cell.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.554
Thanks.

Well, I'm not done with reading
this thank you very much.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.520
I just read it for the fashion.

05:21.521 --> 05:25.590
Ohhhh, sure. That's the bait
they use to lure you -

05:25.591 --> 05:27.659
helpless and unsuspecting women
in...

05:27.660 --> 05:31.997
Mmmhmmm. It's to buy it. It's
when you start reading the

05:31.998 --> 05:37.236
articles, 'ehhhh, that's when
the real brainwashing begins.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.205
You know, the only person trying
to brainwash me around here

05:40.206 --> 05:46.011
Oh yeah? Look at this. Why the
married man you're having an

05:46.012 --> 05:48.880
affair with is probably just
using you, I mean, where do

05:48.881 --> 05:52.085
these broads get all off really.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.821
Well, is that what you're doing?

05:55.054 --> 05:56.188
What?

05:56.189 --> 05:58.291
Using me?

06:03.863 --> 06:11.863
Come on I m here, aren t I?
I m with you every chance I get.

06:17.510 --> 06:20.113
What more do you want from me?

06:20.913 --> 06:27.119
I just don t understand why our
situation has to be so

06:27.120 --> 06:30.922
difficult. I mean you tell me
your wife is crazy and you hate

06:30.923 --> 06:34.993
being married to her, you guys
don't have any children.

06:34.994 --> 06:37.562
I mean, come on you could
leave her this weekend if you

06:37.563 --> 06:39.865
It's not that simple Heather.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.066
It's the money, isn't it?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.134
Um?

06:42.135 --> 06:43.769
She's your meal ticket.

06:43.770 --> 06:47.706
I wouldn't say that. I... I have
my own career, in fact,

06:47.707 --> 06:49.641
my job pays very well.

06:49.642 --> 06:53.512
Yeah, but you've said it
yourself, all of your clients

06:53.513 --> 06:56.181
or most of them are connected to
her family. They would all drop

06:56.182 --> 06:58.183
you if you leave her, right?

06:58.184 --> 07:02.053
And her income is from a trust
fund that you can't touch.

07:02.054 --> 07:03.522
How do you know about that?

07:03.523 --> 07:07.259
I know about her family. The
Smiths own all the timberland

07:07.260 --> 07:11.129
around here. They've been
exploiting the people and

07:11.130 --> 07:14.299
the resources of this area
for decades.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.235
Some people might call that
creating jobs.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.204
She has life insurance, right?

07:19.205 --> 07:21.006
Yeah. So?

07:21.007 --> 07:24.709
It would take care of the
mortgage and probably a lot

07:24.710 --> 07:26.044
for you, too.

07:26.045 --> 07:29.080
I m not sure I like the direct-
ion this conversation is headed.

07:29.081 --> 07:33.251
Look, all I'm saying is that all
of our problems would be

07:33.252 --> 07:35.320
solved if she were to...

07:35.321 --> 07:36.655
What?

07:36.656 --> 07:38.223
Unexpectedly die.

07:38.224 --> 07:39.291
Really?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.693
It could be made to look like a
suicide.

07:41.694 --> 07:42.928
Okay...

07:42.929 --> 07:44.930
No, seriously! You've told me
yourself she's tried to kill

07:44.931 --> 07:46.998
herself before, right?

07:46.999 --> 07:48.733
Will you listen to yourself...
I mean just...

07:48.734 --> 07:50.035
just listen to yourself.

07:50.036 --> 07:55.340
What? Self defense! That's
even better. I mean it is

07:55.341 --> 07:57.275
well documented that she has
threatened to kill you in the

07:57.276 --> 07:58.910
past.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.111
Who are you??

08:00.112 --> 08:02.981
We can do this. Together.
Just us.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.583
I would share the risk with you.

08:04.584 --> 08:07.219
Alright, that s enough, Heather.
Enough of this conversation,

08:07.220 --> 08:09.221
okay? I don't want to talk about
it anymore.

08:09.222 --> 08:12.791
I guess that I just thought that
I could believe you when you

08:12.792 --> 08:14.626
told me that you really loved
me.

08:14.627 --> 08:17.896
Come on... come on.
You know I do.

08:17.897 --> 08:19.364
But you love your wife, too.

08:19.365 --> 08:24.202
Yeah. I mean, No! No!
I didn't mean that.

08:24.203 --> 08:28.039
Oh, Hell!!
Come on!!

08:28.040 --> 08:31.843
I didn t... I didn t
mean it like that!

08:31.844 --> 08:34.645
What I meant was I uh... I
love her like I'd love a

08:34.647 --> 08:37.249
relative, you know? A
family member.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.317
Go away!!

08:39.318 --> 08:42.320
Come on! Open the door, Honey!

08:42.321 --> 08:44.322
Leave me alone!

08:44.323 --> 08:48.927
Mad here. You just just asked
me to kill my wife, you know.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.195
Heather: You know what?
Maybe you should go home

08:50.196 --> 08:54.032
to your psycho wife before she
tries to kill herself again.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.134
Seeing how you love her so much.

08:56.135 --> 08:57.903
Why don t you say that louder so
everyone in the hotel can

08:57.904 --> 09:00.772
You know what? I can see how
somebody being married to

09:00.773 --> 09:02.040
you would want to kill
themselves.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.943
I seem to recall your confessing
to me about your own suicide

09:04.944 --> 09:07.212
attempts, sleeping pills,
wasn't it?

09:07.213 --> 09:09.381
Oh, screw you!!
Go away!!

09:09.382 --> 09:11.383
Alright! Fine!
Fine!

09:11.384 --> 09:15.087
I'll be out here when you're
ready to talk.

09:19.358 --> 09:25.130

09:43.883 --> 09:50.222

09:57.863 --> 10:01.033
Heather? You in there?

10:05.738 --> 10:08.507
Heather?

10:10.943 --> 10:12.211
Heather?

10:20.953 --> 10:28.953
Oh, God! Oh, God...
Oh, God!!

10:40.873 --> 10:43.475
9 1 1, what is your emergency

10:43.476 --> 10:46.945
Uh, yes...
uh... uh.

10:46.946 --> 10:50.315
Sir? What is your emergency?

10:50.316 --> 10:56.055
Uh.... I'm sorry, I...
I miss dialed.

11:02.461 --> 11:09.535

12:34.421 --> 12:35.487
Hey, I'm Chuck.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.589
Oh, hey.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.057
Looks like they got you, too.

12:39.058 --> 12:40.058
Who's they?

12:40.059 --> 12:42.160
Probably some kids last night.

12:42.161 --> 12:46.297
Yeah, they drained me dry.
A few others, too.

12:46.298 --> 12:50.235
Manager says the police are on
their way. What room you in?

12:50.236 --> 12:52.036
I'll come get you when they
show up.

12:52.037 --> 12:55.273
Oh... um... I'm...
I'm not staying here.

12:55.274 --> 12:58.510
Do you know if there's a
gas station nearby?

12:58.511 --> 13:02.046
Yeah. There's a service station
about 15 miles down the

13:02.047 --> 13:03.648
highway south of here.

13:03.649 --> 13:07.652
Seein' as you have a...
high bird, you should

13:07.653 --> 13:09.255
probably make it.

13:09.421 --> 13:10.522
Right.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.457
Less they did anything
else to your car.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.026
Why? What do you mean,
anything else?

13:15.027 --> 13:18.096
Sure you don't want to wait for
the police to show up?

13:18.097 --> 13:21.166
You know file a report?

13:21.167 --> 13:26.272
I'm late as it is. Thank you.
Appreciate it.

13:49.361 --> 13:53.264
The physical laws of sowing and
reaping are just as immutable

13:53.265 --> 13:57.569
as the law of gravity. Whatever
a man sows, that very thing,

13:57.570 --> 14:02.308
shall he reap.

14:04.443 --> 14:12.443
BANJO MUSIC PLAYS

14:26.565 --> 14:29.668
- Sir... Excuse me.
- May I help you?

14:30.035 --> 14:32.036
Uh... yeah. I... I... I can't
seem to get this thing

14:32.037 --> 14:34.672
This is a full service station,
sir. I'm going to pump that

14:34.673 --> 14:36.074
gas for you.

14:36.075 --> 14:37.375
Oh... sorry.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.643
What do you need?

14:38.644 --> 14:42.747
Uh... Can you fill her up with
premium, please?

14:42.748 --> 14:43.716
Pay inside.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.717
Okay. Thank you.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.419
Um hum.

14:50.489 --> 14:51.190
Morning.

14:51.191 --> 14:54.059
Morning.

15:42.074 --> 15:44.509
Can you tell me the uh...
quickest way to get to

15:44.510 --> 15:45.810
I-5 from here?

15:45.811 --> 15:49.647
You're a long ways from I-5.
What I'd do is head back north

15:49.648 --> 15:54.118
about 25 miles and link up with
Highway 165. From there you

15:54.119 --> 15:57.388
take 410. You're looking at
about an hours drive.

15:57.389 --> 16:01.059
Yeah, I know that... uh...
I actually came that way...

16:01.060 --> 16:04.262
uh, I was just wondering if
there was a way to reach the

16:04.263 --> 16:07.365
interstate without going back
the way I came.

16:07.366 --> 16:11.235
Well, what I mean is... um...
if I keep heading south on the

16:11.236 --> 16:15.406
highway here, is there a way
I could eventually find a...

16:15.407 --> 16:16.708
a different route?

16:16.709 --> 16:19.477
I'm sorry sir. Not any way that
I know of.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.112
Great.

16:21.113 --> 16:22.513
Are you staying in the
area over the weekend?

16:22.514 --> 16:25.216
I say are you in the area
over the weekend?

16:25.217 --> 16:30.422
Oh, no. I'm just kinda
exploring. I'm an explorer.

16:32.124 --> 16:33.624
So you're from Seattle?

16:33.625 --> 16:37.762
No... no. Not... not Seattle
exactly. I'm just... uh...

16:37.763 --> 16:40.631
uh... I'm just
from around.

16:40.632 --> 16:41.667
Thank you.

16:43.135 --> 16:48.373
Oh... here. On second thought,
I'll just pay with cash.

16:48.374 --> 16:49.407
That'll be fine.

16:49.408 --> 16:51.743
Thank you.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.345
Okay.

16:55.381 --> 16:56.614
There you go.

16:56.615 --> 17:01.753
If you'll pardon my asking,
sir. Is everything alright?

17:01.754 --> 17:04.821
Yeah. Everything's fine. Why...
why... why do you ask?

17:04.823 --> 17:05.857
No reason.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.893
Thank you.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.329
What has he done to my car?

17:12.330 --> 17:13.564
Hey!

17:13.565 --> 17:15.700
Excuse me! Can I help you?
What... what...

17:15.701 --> 17:18.669
I noticed this pool of
water under your car.

17:18.670 --> 17:23.141
It's just as I suspected. You've
got a hole in your radiator.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.309
A hole? That's... that's
impossible! This is

17:25.310 --> 17:30.314
If you look down here, you ll
see that your fan belt broke

17:30.315 --> 17:33.418
and because the fan itself was
probably loose, it slashed

17:33.419 --> 17:37.789
That's crazy! Then why isn't
there a water trail leading

17:37.790 --> 17:39.223
into your parking lot?

17:39.224 --> 17:40.858
It must have just happened
when you pulled in.

17:40.859 --> 17:45.631
Not necessarily, sir. This sort
of thing happens all the time.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.301
Goddamn it!

17:51.537 --> 17:53.538
I was told there were some kids
messing around with people s

17:53.539 --> 17:55.840
cars back at the motel. They
must have done this.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.341
You were at a motel?

17:57.342 --> 17:58.576
Over at the Seasons?

17:58.577 --> 18:02.780
No... the guy who told me said
he was... was staying at

18:02.781 --> 18:04.248
a motel.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.484
Well, sir, if this is a new car.
Someone might have

18:06.485 --> 18:08.519
loosened your fan.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.322
Is there a reason someone would
want to do that to you?

18:11.323 --> 18:13.724
No... Look, forget I mentioned
it. Um... how long will it

18:13.725 --> 18:15.226
take for you guys to fix it?

18:15.227 --> 18:17.328
We could sell you a new fan
belt that'd probably work.

18:17.329 --> 18:20.364
But someone's going to have to
bend that fan back in place and

18:20.365 --> 18:23.334
patch up the hole in the
radiator. We're just not set up

18:23.335 --> 18:26.571
Can't you make some calls and
find out if someone in the

18:26.572 --> 18:28.473
area can help me?

18:28.474 --> 18:31.342
Okay, Bob, thanks. I ll tell
him. Well, we ran into a

18:31.343 --> 18:32.244
bit of luck.

18:32.245 --> 18:35.480
There's a repair shop up in
Creechville that can do

18:35.481 --> 18:36.547
the work.

18:36.548 --> 18:40.218
Creechville. It's about 20 miles
away as the crow flies.

18:40.219 --> 18:41.686
It's an old logging town.

18:41.687 --> 18:45.256
Um... I've never heard of it.
I mean I've never driven

18:45.257 --> 18:48.292
Well, you wouldn't drive through
the place. It's not on the way

18:48.293 --> 18:51.229
to anywhere. Like I say, it's
just an old logging town.

18:51.230 --> 18:52.763
One road leading in and out.

18:52.764 --> 18:55.266
And there are people up there
who know how to work on

18:55.267 --> 18:58.002
Well, they just need to bend
your fan back in place,

18:58.003 --> 18:59.770
patch up the radiator.

18:59.771 --> 19:03.407
They come down here to buy parts
from me now and again but

19:03.408 --> 19:07.412
mostly people from Creechville
stick to themselves.

19:07.613 --> 19:10.949
Well, how... how do I get my car
up there?

19:31.470 --> 19:34.639
We can probably hammer it back
into shape but it won t be a

19:34.640 --> 19:37.475
long term fix. You'll have to
replace it with a new one when

19:37.476 --> 19:38.776
you get back to the city.

19:38.777 --> 19:40.945
I don't understand how something
like this could have happened

19:40.946 --> 19:42.981
without my noticing.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.083
So what about the radiator?

19:46.618 --> 19:49.854
It's a pretty big gash. We can
patch that well enough for you

19:49.855 --> 19:52.523
to make it home but then you're
going to need to get you a new

19:52.524 --> 19:53.624
radiator too.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.593
How long is all this going
to take?

19:55.594 --> 19:58.930
Well, we can start on it this
afternoon. We could have it

19:58.931 --> 20:02.433
ready by... tomorrow morning
around 10.

20:02.434 --> 20:06.070
I need to be out of here today.
Look... if it's a matter of

20:06.071 --> 20:09.640
money, I'd be more than happy to
pay whatever is necessary to

20:09.641 --> 20:13.477
Sir, your business is a
priority to us, but I m...

20:13.478 --> 20:18.482
I'm sorry, tomorrow is the best
we can do.

20:18.483 --> 20:23.321
Uh... Is there a hotel
nearby that I could stay at?

20:23.322 --> 20:27.391
Well, we got a motel here in
town, but it s probably too

20:27.392 --> 20:30.461
run down for your taste.

20:30.462 --> 20:32.797
Yeah... yeah. There s a much
better place about 40 minutes

20:32.798 --> 20:37.001
away, probably passed that on
your way in. It's not far from

20:37.002 --> 20:39.070
where we picked you up at. I'll
just have Fran here drive

20:39.071 --> 20:43.341
Thanks all the same, but I...
I'd sooner just...

20:43.342 --> 20:45.009
just stay here in town near the
car.

20:45.010 --> 20:47.878
I d be happy to drive you
over to The Seasons. I...

20:47.879 --> 20:50.481
I don't know if you're familiar
with it, but the rooms are

20:50.482 --> 20:51.849
real nice.

20:51.850 --> 20:56.821
I'm sure it's nice, but I'd
prefer to just stay here.

20:56.822 --> 20:59.657
Suit yourself. I'll call and let
them know you're on the way.

20:59.658 --> 21:03.394
Okay, so where is this place?

21:03.395 --> 21:07.064
So just head down this road,
then make a left on the main

21:07.065 --> 21:10.434
street and just keep going and
you'll run right into it.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.504
Thank you.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.775
I'll give you a call over in the
morning when your car is

21:17.776 --> 21:18.744
ready, sir.

21:18.745 --> 21:21.146
Thank you.

21:31.823 --> 21:33.124
That the guy?

21:33.125 --> 21:37.562
Yep, that's him.

21:56.648 --> 22:04.648
Left on main. Keep going.
You can't miss it!

22:10.462 --> 22:11.930
Excuse me, sir.

22:12.831 --> 22:16.667
You know where the... uh...
where the motel is in town?

22:16.668 --> 22:19.136
Sure, go down to the stop sign,
make a right, can't miss it.

22:19.137 --> 22:20.471
Thank you.

22:20.472 --> 22:22.240
I'm Bill Creech.

22:22.574 --> 22:25.776
Oh... um... I'm...
I'm Brooks.

22:25.777 --> 22:27.878
We don't get visitors here
very often.

22:27.879 --> 22:31.649
Well, I can see why. Uh...
I've lived in Washington

22:31.650 --> 22:34.819
for years and it's the first
time I've heard of the place.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.620
We're off the beaten path.

22:36.621 --> 22:37.988
That's certainly an
understatement.

22:37.989 --> 22:40.991
We were a logging town for
years. The timber company

22:40.992 --> 22:45.096
pulled out in 89, some folks
decided to leave. Most of us

22:45.097 --> 22:48.065
refused to let this place die.
Hi Cindy!

22:48.066 --> 22:49.533
Hi Bill!

22:49.534 --> 22:50.735
Cindy, this is Brooks.

22:50.736 --> 22:54.071
Hi, Brooks! So you're a
lawyer?

22:54.072 --> 22:55.606
How'd you know that?

22:55.607 --> 22:59.510
Oh... sorry... I, I used to work
in a law office and you

22:59.511 --> 23:02.647
attorneys just have a certain
look about you, that's all.

23:02.981 --> 23:05.183
Really? What... what kind
of look is that?

23:05.684 --> 23:09.487
You know. I'm so sorry, I really
didn't mean anything by it.

23:09.488 --> 23:13.658
Um... please excuse me. I
need to get to work.

23:15.794 --> 23:19.196
Well, it was nice chatting with
you, I'd better get um...

23:19.197 --> 23:20.564
checked into my room.

23:20.565 --> 23:23.802
I'm sure we'll see you again
soon.

23:59.604 --> 24:07.604
Wow. Hello?
Hello!

24:11.917 --> 24:13.618
RINGS BELL

24:13.919 --> 24:18.823

Auck! I'll be there

24:18.824 --> 24:21.827
in a minute!!

24:30.969 --> 24:32.570
Can I help you?

24:32.571 --> 24:35.706
Yes, I would like a room for
tonight, please.

24:35.707 --> 24:39.076
You have to wait til my husband,
Bruce, comes back.

24:39.077 --> 24:42.246
Well, uh... can't you just
help me?

24:42.247 --> 24:47.151
Well, sir, if I could help you,
I probably wouldn t have told

24:47.152 --> 24:50.989
you that you have to wait until
my husband comes back.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.959
Okay.

25:03.235 --> 25:04.835
Uh... look, my name is
Brooks.

25:04.836 --> 25:07.872
I already know who you
are. I just got off the phone

25:07.873 --> 25:09.106
with Stew.

25:09.107 --> 25:10.174
Hi, can I help you?

25:10.175 --> 25:15.079
I thought you left.
This is the guy.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.314
Hi, I'm Bruce and this is
my wife, Greta.

25:17.315 --> 25:18.216
Charmed.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.150
Yes. We, already met.

25:20.151 --> 25:21.652
So... then just for tonight?

25:21.653 --> 25:23.221
Let's hope so.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.024
Do you prefer a king bed?

25:27.025 --> 25:29.294
Sure... whatever.

25:29.628 --> 25:34.699
I just need a $10 deposit
for incidentals.

25:35.934 --> 25:39.838
You gotta be kidding me!

25:43.008 --> 25:47.779
SCOFFS

25:55.854 --> 26:00.058
God...

26:07.799 --> 26:11.336
Phone Operator:
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

26:14.839 --> 26:16.741
Wow!

26:48.173 --> 26:49.874
RINGS BELL

26:50.108 --> 26:53.044
Just a minute!

27:01.386 --> 27:04.488
Oh, it's you.

27:04.489 --> 27:06.023
Hi. Do you know where
I might...

27:06.024 --> 27:09.861
Bruce!

27:11.296 --> 27:13.964
You gotta love that small
town hospitality.

27:13.965 --> 27:17.201
My apologies about that. How's
that room working out for

27:17.202 --> 27:19.103
you, sir?

27:19.104 --> 27:20.804
Just peachy.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.272
Can I help you?

27:22.273 --> 27:26.043
Yes. Do you know where I might
go to get a drink around here?

27:26.044 --> 27:29.446
Yeah. Walt Porter's place, just
around the corner from here.

27:29.447 --> 27:31.215
Thanks.

27:31.216 --> 27:34.451
You be real careful out there
tonight, sir.

27:34.452 --> 27:39.090
Thank you.

27:40.992 --> 27:47.831
BAR SOUNDS

27:47.832 --> 27:53.938
CROWD GOES QUIET.

28:06.785 --> 28:08.819
Excuse me, I'll...
I'll have a beer.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.988
You don't look like
you're from here.

28:10.989 --> 28:12.457
Thank you.

28:13.925 --> 28:17.027
You're kinda funny looking.

28:17.028 --> 28:22.800
How about that beer? Ma'am...
Jeez... what does a fella have

28:22.801 --> 28:25.002
to do get a beer in this place?

28:25.003 --> 28:26.970
You want some of mine?

28:26.971 --> 28:34.411
Would... you... like... to...
mine... share with me?

28:34.412 --> 28:36.980
That s a tempting offer but I m
the kinda guy that

28:36.981 --> 28:40.085
likes to drink his own.
Thanks.

28:41.886 --> 28:46.224
Well, if you change your mind,
the offer still stands.

28:49.127 --> 28:52.430
Hello? Ma'am?
Hello?

28:53.498 --> 28:55.833
- Hey Ricky!
- Did you lose a boot?

28:55.834 --> 28:58.002
RICKY ;
Give 'er back!

29:00.538 --> 29:02.440
Throw it over here!

29:02.841 --> 29:06.411
Lose one? It's more like
he found one?

29:12.016 --> 29:16.588
OFF CAMERA SOMEONE
LAUGHS... LAUGHTER.

29:20.558 --> 29:21.925
That was funny.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.460
Thanks, I think.

29:23.461 --> 29:25.429
I'm Walt Porter.
I own this bar.

29:25.430 --> 29:28.932
Hi, I'm Brooks. Is this... uh,
where you... uh, throw

29:28.933 --> 29:30.200
me out on my ear?

29:30.201 --> 29:33.171
Hell no. Your business is
welcome here.

29:34.873 --> 29:37.174
Becky, I think I heard this
gentleman order a beer

29:37.175 --> 29:38.710
a moment ago.

29:39.043 --> 29:40.512
Thank you.

29:40.912 --> 29:43.247
So, you're that Seattle attorney
with the Lexus over at

29:43.248 --> 29:45.048
Stew's shop huh?

29:45.049 --> 29:47.551
How is that everyone seems to
know who I am?

29:47.552 --> 29:51.355
Well, the truth is... uh, you
left some of your legal

29:51.356 --> 29:54.258
paperwork in the car and Stew
and the boys over there

29:54.259 --> 29:55.459
took note.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.361
Is that so?

29:57.362 --> 29:59.363
Shoot, all the better for you as
I see it.

29:59.364 --> 30:00.631
How's that?

30:00.632 --> 30:03.167
Um... Nobody wants to do
slipshod work on an

30:03.168 --> 30:04.702
attorney's car.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.338
I wish that were true.

30:08.139 --> 30:10.475
It's a nice place you got here.

30:11.176 --> 30:15.279
Not really. Uh... but it s
the only place in town folks

30:15.280 --> 30:18.482
can go to get a drink. Not like
those fancy places, I bet you go

30:18.483 --> 30:20.017
to up in Seattle.

30:20.018 --> 30:22.720
Uhh, not that fancy.

30:23.588 --> 30:24.988
Umm??

30:24.989 --> 30:27.257
Howdy! The name's Curtis.

30:27.258 --> 30:28.126
Hi.

30:28.127 --> 30:29.626
I understand you're a lawyer,
Sir.

30:29.627 --> 30:31.028
I am.

30:31.029 --> 30:33.097
Do you know much about
divorce law?

30:33.331 --> 30:36.934
Um, enough to steer
well clear of it.

30:36.935 --> 30:38.368
Would you mind if I asked
you a question?

30:38.369 --> 30:41.405
I ve been married for over 30
years. My wife moved out last

30:41.406 --> 30:45.309
month and now she's got this
lawyer down in Pierce County

30:45.310 --> 30:48.712
uhhh... and they're going to try
to take me to the cleaners.

30:48.713 --> 30:52.516
Now, what I wanted to ask you
was can... can they do that?

30:52.517 --> 30:54.618
I... supported her for over 30
years and she did nothing but

30:54.619 --> 30:58.188
sit home and get fat, and now,
according to her attorney

30:58.189 --> 31:01.658
she can take everything I own
and force me to support her

31:01.659 --> 31:03.093
for the rest of her life.

31:03.094 --> 31:07.097
I hear you, Curtis, but uhm,
unless you signed a Pre-Nup,

31:07.098 --> 31:09.566
there's really no getting around
the... uh, community property

31:09.567 --> 31:10.401
laws in this state.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.135
Community property!

31:12.136 --> 31:15.539
Um-huh. That's where she gets to
keep the property and you,

31:15.540 --> 31:18.409
my friend, get to live out in
the community.

31:22.981 --> 31:25.182
Smells like communism to me.

31:25.183 --> 31:31.688
Curtis! It's the screwing you
get for all the screwing

31:31.689 --> 31:34.092
you got!

31:38.162 --> 31:41.265
So my client says to me before
his divorce trial, I know I m

31:41.266 --> 31:44.101
going to take it up the ass on
this one, your job is so that

31:44.102 --> 31:46.404
they don't pour sand in
the Vaseline.

31:49.274 --> 31:53.143
I told my boss how I lost the
trial. He said, "Did the client

31:53.144 --> 31:56.480
pay in full?" When I told him
yes, he said, "Oh, you won

31:56.481 --> 31:58.482
that one!"

31:58.483 --> 32:03.120
So the judge sentences him to
500 years on all 14 counts

32:03.121 --> 32:06.156
and when the Defendant
protested, the judge just

32:06.157 --> 32:09.326
smiled and said, Don t worry
Mr. Ramirez, you can cut that

32:09.327 --> 32:12.497
time in half with good
behavior."

32:14.399 --> 32:18.568
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug, chug, chug

32:18.569 --> 32:24.609
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug, chug, chug

32:27.645 --> 32:30.614
You got some real funny stories,
Counselor. You made me

32:30.615 --> 32:32.717
feel better.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.356
CRYING CAN BE HEARD

32:42.093 --> 32:47.264
Hey, Walt. Who is that guy?

32:47.265 --> 32:50.134
That there's Bobby Creech.

32:51.135 --> 32:54.237
Hmmm. I think I met his
dad today?

32:54.238 --> 32:57.674
No, you met his granddaddy.

32:57.675 --> 32:59.577
Oh....

33:01.079 --> 33:02.512
Why is he so broken up?

33:02.513 --> 33:05.148
Found out this afternoon that
his wife's dead.

33:05.149 --> 33:08.518
Uh... that's too bad.

33:08.519 --> 33:12.322
The handwriting was on the wall
if you ask me. Old Heather

33:12.323 --> 33:15.759
had all sorts of problems,
mental and otherwise.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.361
Including trying to sleep
with every guy...

33:17.362 --> 33:19.296
Wait, wait a minute. Did...
did you say her name was...

33:19.297 --> 33:23.368
Yeah, good old pill
popping Heather.

33:23.534 --> 33:26.270
That lady was the biggest whore
in the county.

33:26.804 --> 33:29.840
I tried to warn Bobby before he
got married to that bitch.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.642
Wouldn t ya know he didn t
talk to me for almost a year

33:32.643 --> 33:34.111
after that.

33:34.112 --> 33:38.782
Well, they found her around noon
sprawled out on the bathroom

33:38.783 --> 33:41.419
floor in some motel up the
highway.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.153
Mo... motel?

33:43.154 --> 33:47.124
Yeah, the Seasons I think it
was. She'd overdosed on

33:47.125 --> 33:50.560
sleeping pills, You know, she's
trying to take her own life.

33:50.561 --> 33:54.698
She was in a coma when the
cleaning lady found her.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.266
She died later at the hospital.

33:56.267 --> 33:59.669
She was... uh, alive when they,
when they found her?

33:59.670 --> 34:02.873
Yes, sir. Apparently, they said
at the hospital if somebody

34:02.874 --> 34:06.510
had found her even just an hour
sooner, huh...

34:06.511 --> 34:08.245
she probably would have
pulled through.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.713
Oh, God.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.681
You want to know the
real rub of the whole thing?

34:12.683 --> 34:13.784
What?

34:13.784 --> 34:15.786
She wasn't alone in that
motel room.

34:15.786 --> 34:19.889
You don't think she'd be staying
in a motel all by herself?

34:19.891 --> 34:21.492
That woman?

34:21.759 --> 34:24.261
Well, how... how do you
know for sure?

34:24.262 --> 34:27.431
Well, it seems some folks at the
motel saw him leave her room

34:27.431 --> 34:31.467
this morning in an awful hurry.
The way I figure it, whoever

34:31.469 --> 34:34.371
this guy was that she was
banging probably woke up

34:34.371 --> 34:36.907
this morning and found her on
the floor.

34:36.908 --> 34:41.277
Taking her for dead, not wanting
to deal with the cops,

34:41.279 --> 34:43.880
I think he just decided to get
the hell out of Dodge.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.315
But then, being an attorney, you
probably see this stuff all the

34:46.317 --> 34:47.350
time...

34:47.351 --> 34:50.320
Anybody, uh, anybody know
who this guy is?

34:50.321 --> 34:52.789
No... not yet anyway.

34:52.790 --> 34:57.394
Well, she was seeing three
different guys, not counting

34:57.395 --> 34:58.829
her husband, Bobby, of course.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.263
Of course.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.599
So the Creech s and some other
folks are trying to track down

35:02.600 --> 35:04.734
the identity of whoever this guy
was that was with her at the

35:04.735 --> 35:08.639
motel. They're blaming whoever
he is for Heather's death.

35:09.207 --> 35:10.474
Can't say I blame them for that.

35:10.475 --> 35:12.909
So they're... they're trying to
find this guy so they can...

35:12.910 --> 35:15.245
they can turn him into the
police, right?

35:15.246 --> 35:19.850
Well, maybe, but... uh, I think
it's going to be a little more

35:19.851 --> 35:26.623
Well, you didn t hear it from me
but ...uh well what I mean

35:26.624 --> 35:28.758
to say is I assume we can have
a little attorney/client

35:28.759 --> 35:29.660
privilege here?

35:29.661 --> 35:32.863
Uh, a couple of years back,
Heather was carrying on with

35:32.864 --> 35:35.333
a biker dude from Ashford.

35:35.600 --> 35:39.569
Yeah, they were having an affair
and being right out in the open

35:39.570 --> 35:40.604
about the whole thing...

35:40.605 --> 35:45.275
And... uh, the Creeches
approached the guy about it.

35:45.276 --> 35:48.645
So, Mr. Badass tells the
Creeches to go screw

35:48.646 --> 35:49.813
themselves.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.014
Then what?

35:51.015 --> 35:55.485
And then Mr. Badass Biker
Dude up and disappears

35:55.486 --> 35:57.989
without a trace one day.

36:02.493 --> 36:07.597
Well, maybe, uh... the guy
just decided to move on.

36:07.598 --> 36:12.602
Yeah, well word around the
campfire, he moved on up

36:12.603 --> 36:15.639
the mountain where he's buried
under 18 feet of dirt courtesy

36:15.640 --> 36:17.841
of our town's elder citizens.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.043
Th... th, that's just a
rumor right?

36:20.044 --> 36:24.681
Uhh, I don't know. Heather
didn't seem to think so.

36:24.682 --> 36:29.286
You actually think they want to
kill this guy, I mean...

36:29.287 --> 36:31.821
assuming they find him right?

36:31.822 --> 36:34.391
Oh, they'll find his ass
alright?

36:34.392 --> 36:37.028
You can count on that.

36:37.595 --> 36:41.998
Hey Walt! Can we see you
over here for a minute?

36:41.999 --> 36:44.401
That's Johnny Creech, Bobby's
brother. I'd better go pay my

36:44.402 --> 36:49.507
respects. You just sit tight,
Counselor. I'll be right back.

36:52.777 --> 36:54.478
Can I get you anything else,
hon?

36:54.745 --> 36:58.882
No, I'm fine. Uh, where's
the restroom?

36:58.883 --> 37:02.352
Through the kitchen, down
the hall. Can't miss it.

37:02.353 --> 37:04.589
Oh, Thank you.

37:22.573 --> 37:28.578
C'mon man, pull yourself
together. No one here

37:28.579 --> 37:30.781
knows shit.

37:43.894 --> 37:47.131
Hey Counselor, where are you
off to in such a hurry?

37:50.735 --> 37:56.573
Oh, uh, Walt, thanks for the
drinks, but I... I, gotta get

37:56.574 --> 37:57.475
home to bed.

37:57.476 --> 37:58.875
Ahh, son, let me buy you
another round.

37:58.876 --> 38:02.545
Ahh, mmm... I really need
to get some sleep.

38:02.546 --> 38:05.682
Come on, Counselor, just a quick
nightcap with some 10 year old

38:05.683 --> 38:08.052
whiskey I just opened.

38:18.396 --> 38:21.398
Okay, just a small one.

38:21.399 --> 38:23.534
Now you're talking.

38:36.914 --> 38:37.882
Here's to ya!

38:37.883 --> 38:41.819
No Sir, this one's for you.

38:47.591 --> 38:53.096
That's good. Aww... I needed
that! Yeah, I needed that.

38:53.097 --> 38:54.964
You know, Brooks, it's been a
real pleasure having you

38:54.965 --> 38:56.032
here in my place.

38:56.033 --> 38:57.867
Naw, the pleasures all mine.

38:57.868 --> 38:59.502
You take care now.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.639
You too...

39:18.622 --> 39:21.625
Give me his room key.

39:26.097 --> 39:27.932
ROOSTER CROWS

39:30.501 --> 39:32.169
HE IS SNORING.

39:38.175 --> 39:41.112
Ooh...

39:54.725 --> 39:57.728
Fuck! What the fuck!

40:00.631 --> 40:05.770
Shit! Fuck!

40:05.970 --> 40:10.841
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

40:23.154 --> 40:26.156
You! I want to talk
to you!

40:26.157 --> 40:29.526
You! I thought I told you to
get the hell out of here.

40:29.527 --> 40:33.263
I've been robbed! My, my,...
my, my laptop, my phone!

40:33.264 --> 40:34.731
My room has been ransacked!

40:34.732 --> 40:38.034
I don't know about that! What I
do know is that you came in

40:38.035 --> 40:41.304
here last night drunk as a
skunk and screamed profanities

40:41.305 --> 40:42.139
at my wife.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.541
What! I was not drunk
last night!

40:44.542 --> 40:47.043
Yes! You were! You also
threatened us. Now,

40:47.044 --> 40:49.847
get out of here before I call
the police!

40:50.080 --> 40:52.782
Where are my belongings?
I want them right now!

40:52.783 --> 40:57.887
You get out of here and don't
you ever come back here again!

40:57.888 --> 41:00.723
You've not heard the last from
me!

41:00.724 --> 41:01.891
Don't come back!

41:01.892 --> 41:04.060
You couldn't pay me to!

41:04.061 --> 41:07.330
Cindy, Cindy... Hold... hold on
a sec, wait, wait... wait, wait.

41:07.331 --> 41:09.266
Hold on... wait!

41:09.733 --> 41:11.634
You seen Walt Porter?

41:11.635 --> 41:13.703
Please, Mister, don't
drag me into this.

41:13.704 --> 41:15.872
Drag, drag you into what?
What are you talking about?

41:15.873 --> 41:18.308
Look you're in grave danger.
You need to get out of here!

41:18.309 --> 41:19.809
What do you mean?

41:19.810 --> 41:21.978
I never met you before in my
life. Now, please leave me

41:21.979 --> 41:23.947
Alone!

41:23.948 --> 41:24.849
Wait... wait a minute!

41:24.850 --> 41:28.285
No! Get your hands off of
me! Help!

41:31.255 --> 41:33.957
What kind of game are you people
playing?

41:33.958 --> 41:39.963
- Leave her alone!
- Shit Bird!

41:39.964 --> 41:41.966
Kay.

41:46.103 --> 41:48.738
Walt! Hey Walt!
You in there?

41:48.739 --> 41:50.740
It's closed, Asshole!

41:50.741 --> 41:54.310
I can see that. Thank you.

41:54.311 --> 41:56.145
Walt! Open up!

41:56.146 --> 42:00.917
Nobody wants you here.
Why don't you just leave!

42:00.918 --> 42:05.222
And why don't you mind your
own business, dumb redneck!

42:07.024 --> 42:09.626
What did you call me?

42:09.627 --> 42:12.429
A dumb red...

42:13.964 --> 42:17.734
Fuck! That fucking hurt!

42:17.735 --> 42:22.172
That's right! Run home to your
Mom! You little pussy!

42:23.674 --> 42:31.674
MOB STARTS YELLING

42:38.989 --> 42:41.058
Hey!

42:41.292 --> 42:44.260
Yes, you can help me!
You can help me by getting

42:44.261 --> 42:46.796
my car right now, please.

42:46.797 --> 42:49.899
Um, um... I'm sorry, sir.
I don't understand.

42:49.900 --> 42:52.835
My Lexus, the one I dropped
off yesterday.

42:52.836 --> 42:54.804
The one that was supposed to be
ready by now?

42:54.805 --> 42:57.874
Just get my fucking car and
bring it out right now!

42:57.875 --> 43:00.777
Sir, we don't have your Lexus
here or any Lexus for that

43:00.778 --> 43:04.781
Oh, is that so? Well, then you
won't mind if I take a look

43:04.782 --> 43:06.883
around just to make sure.

43:06.884 --> 43:10.019
Sir, is this some kind of joke
because it's not very funny.

43:10.020 --> 43:12.822
Where the fuck is my car? What
the fuck did you do with my car?

43:12.823 --> 43:13.757
Huh!

43:13.758 --> 43:15.124
I think you need to leave.
Mister.

43:15.125 --> 43:18.094
You know what? I've had just
about enough of the little

43:18.095 --> 43:20.730
games you people are
playing here.

43:20.731 --> 43:22.065
Well, I don't have your car.

43:22.066 --> 43:25.034
Well, then you better find it
before I smash your skull

43:25.035 --> 43:26.469
against this wall like an egg!

43:26.470 --> 43:34.470
There he is boys!

44:07.845 --> 44:10.980
Hey Counselor! What are
you running for?

44:10.981 --> 44:17.488
We just want to talk to you is
all! We, we ain't gonna
hurtcha!

45:01.932 --> 45:06.637
VEHICLE CAN BE HEARD

45:15.312 --> 45:17.246
Oh... Thank God!

45:17.247 --> 45:19.048
What the hell you doing
out here?

45:19.049 --> 45:20.116
I came from Creechville.

45:20.117 --> 45:23.019
Creechville? That's like three
miles away!?

45:23.020 --> 45:27.290
Yeah, I know. Look, can
you give me a ride? Please?

45:27.291 --> 45:28.591
Where do you want a ride to?

45:28.592 --> 45:32.428
Anywhere, just away from here.
Someplace where I can...

45:32.429 --> 45:34.297
you know, make a call.

45:34.298 --> 45:37.500
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
Against County Policy.

45:37.501 --> 45:40.603
Well, well... if you can't do
that then why'd you ask me

45:40.604 --> 45:41.871
where you could take me?

45:41.872 --> 45:45.308
I don't know, I was just
curious, I guess.

45:45.309 --> 45:49.479
Look, sir. This is... this is
a life and death situation.

45:49.480 --> 45:52.281
I'm sorry but I could
lose my job.

45:52.282 --> 45:55.418
Loo, loo... lose your job?
Who would ever know.

45:55.419 --> 45:58.888
I don't know. I could be drunk
at a bar and just let it slip.

45:58.889 --> 46:03.259
Look, I... I, I have a bunch of
crazed lunatics who are trying

46:03.260 --> 46:07.497
to kill me! Can you please,
for the love of God, give me

46:07.498 --> 46:10.099
a lift out of here! I'm begging
you! Please!

46:10.100 --> 46:13.202
I said no. Now, I've got to get
back to work.

46:13.203 --> 46:18.541
No, no please! Don't go. It, it,
it's okay. Just a ride. Not far.

46:18.542 --> 46:23.981
I don't need to go far. Just a
little ways further, please.

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:41.136
I have the right to speak to a
lawyer.

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:42.270
You're a lawyer aren't ya?

01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:45.375
Guess you'll have to talk to
yourself, then.

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:49.379
Fuck You! Asshole!

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:52.115
You watch it!

01:01:10.933 --> 01:01:12.902
Oh, Jeez.

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:19.775
What kind of place is this?

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:24.514
- What's the matter, Man?
- Not cozy enough for you?

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.082
Who's there?

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:29.018
Just me.

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:31.319
Who's me?

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.255
SOUND OF CLAPPING

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:35.090
I'm Mark.

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:38.126
Well, Mark, you certainly have a
cozy enough looking cell.

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:39.995
Uh, well, thank you.

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:45.867
I am, but now that you're here
they made me the jail trustee.

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:47.269
You're kidding me right?

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:50.138
Naw, and if I were you, I d
watch the way you talk to

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:53.175
these officers here, unless
you want to do some time

01:01:53.176 --> 01:01:56.845
You mean that this isn't the
hole? There's someplace

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:57.513
worse than this?

01:01:57.514 --> 01:01:59.047
Oh, hell yeah.

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:00.982
Well, I take it you spent
some time in it.

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:04.186
A whole month. Man, I
wouldn't wish that on

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:07.089
my worst enemy. That's
why I'm warning you.

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:12.060
Thank you, Mark, but I don t
belong in here. They re lacking

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:15.263
proper... uh, venue and
jurisdiction. They illegally

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:19.568
arrest me without any basis
probable cause. When I get

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:22.304
with my civil suit against these
clowns, I m gonna own

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:25.507
this one-horse town. They re
gonna rue the day they put

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:27.542
me in here, I can tell you that.

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:31.179
You know that was the exact
same thing I said when they

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.448
hauled me in here. Can I
step around? This is a little

01:02:33.449 --> 01:02:35.283
awkward talking to you like
this...

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:38.353
Oh, and can you please shut
the lid on that? That shit has

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:40.490
been bugging me for three weeks.

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.462
Wait, wait a minute. Your cell
door doesn't lock?

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:51.266
Uh, well, not exactly. I mean,
it locks. They just allow it

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:52.334
to stay unlocked.

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:54.870
You mean, you... you,
you can get out of here?

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:57.873
Yeah, I mean, they'll let me
out to go to church, see my

01:02:57.874 --> 01:03:02.444
family twice a week and other
stuff. It's just a privilege

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.912
I've earned over time.

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:07.449
Over time... How, long have
you been in here?

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:10.585
Oh, I don't know, Man.
Uh, 2... 2 1/2 years give

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:16.424
Two and a half years. Huh ..
Holy shit! Look Mark...

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:20.462
I m an attorney and a former
prosecutor at that. This type

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:23.298
of municipality that we're in
has limited jursidiction.

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:25.433
They can only prosecute
midemeanors. They can't

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:26.935
hold anyone over a year.

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:29.437
Yeah, yeah. Look man, what I
don't think you're grasping

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:33.441
here is that they do things a
little differently around here.

01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:36.178
Oh... well, that's bullshit!
Okay? They still have

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:41.483
to follow the law. So, what are
you allegedly in for anyway?

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:45.453
Uh, well, basically I've got
problems with alcohol.

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:52.460
I'm an alcoholic and um... I
have or at least, I had

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:53.695
problems with anger.

01:03:53.696 --> 01:03:57.332
Those are not crimes.
Trust me.

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:59.434
Well, that's what I'm in
here for, Man.

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:03.338
Okay, uh, let me back up...
um, when you were in

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:06.241
court what did the judge say you
were charged with?

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:07.143
Court?

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:08.110
Yeah.

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:09.277
Judge?

01:04:09.278 --> 01:04:10.979
Yesss.

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.415
We don't have judges in this
town. I've never been before

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:15.317
a judge for anything in my life.

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:17.352
Well, then who ordered you
into this place?

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:18.587
The Elders.

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:22.257
You know the... the, town
elders, leaders. Totally

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:23.959
uncool types.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.596
Look, I don t know who to break
this to you, but your elder

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:30.732
leaders, or whoever they are,
do not have the legal authority

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:33.568
to confine you, me or anyone
else for that matter.

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:35.403
Well, I guess you can tell 'em
that yourself when you see

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:36.438
them tomorrow morning.

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:39.374
Yeah, I overheard the officers
talking about it.

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:40.009
You did?

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:43.144
What di... did you happen to
hear what they... they,

01:04:43.145 --> 01:04:44.379
they're supposedly charging
me with?

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.282
Well, no, but I'll tell you
this much. Whatever it

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.317
is, it's something heavy.

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:51.019
What do you mean, heavy?

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:53.755
Cause they usually don t lock
anybody up in here before

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:55.156
they see them.

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:58.493
Well, there was this one other
time that I can think of...

01:04:58.494 --> 01:04:59.694
Oh, who was that?

01:04:59.695 --> 01:05:02.264
Oh, just this... this really
weird biker dude.

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:04.199
Totally negative energy, too.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.700
Well, what happened to him?

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:08.603
I don't know. I woke up one
morning and he was gone.

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:14.810
Never saw him again.
Karma.

01:05:28.224 --> 01:05:29.524
Mark?

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:34.262
Who?

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:35.430
Heather?

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:37.600
Hi, Baby.

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:44.539
Heather. They... They,
they said you were...

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.474
That I was dead?

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:50.545
Yesss. Oh, God... it's
so good to see you.

01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:53.281
Oh, it's great to see you,
too, Honey.

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:57.319
Oh God, you have no idea what's
been going on. Huh,

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:02.157
these people, they're... they're
crazy. They think I'm

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:04.426
responsible for your death.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:08.463
They might have exaggerated
my situation a little bit.

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:10.366
Just a little bit?

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:17.605
I'm sorry, it's just... it's
really funny to see you

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:19.308
like this.

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:24.279
Look, Heather, this is no joke.
You gotta talk to these people

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.513
help clear it up, you know...

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:27.682
Oh, yeah, I know. I've talked
with them. I doubt there's

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:29.651
going to be anything to
clear up though.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:34.156
What do you mean? Wha...
What do they have me in for?

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:42.364
Uh, look, you gotta help me.

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:43.865
I'm afraid I can't do that.

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:46.302
What the hell are you talking
about?

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:49.204
In case you hadn't noticed, I'm
in a fucking cell, Heather.

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:53.608
Wow! You know the last time
you saw me, I was laying on

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:57.612
the bathroom floor of the
motel. Taking me for dead, you

01:06:57.613 --> 01:07:01.616
were all too ready to just
leave me there, without even the

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:03.785
dignity of calling the
authorities.

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:06.287
I'm sorry. Heather... I, I,
I....

01:07:06.288 --> 01:07:08.189
You wiped down the room, you
did everything you could to

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:11.459
conceal the fact that you were
with me and then I show up

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:16.398
alive and all you can talk
about is you and your own

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:19.601
situation. A situation, I might
add, that you are responsible

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:20.469
for creating.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:21.836
I... I, I do love you.

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:25.173
Yeah? You know the only
person that you love,

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:26.574
Brooks, is yourself.

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:29.544
No, no... no, I, I... I mean it.
I do love you, and I, I want

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:33.782
to prove it to you. But first
you got to get me out of here.

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:36.818
You've got to call my lawyer.
Yeah... uh, you have something

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:40.922
I'm sorry, I can't do that. And
even if I could, I wouldn't

01:07:40.923 --> 01:07:42.625
help you.

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:48.830
Ohhh, I get it. It's like that,
huh? I see. Well, why aren't

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:51.766
you in this cell with me? Huh?
I mean you are married to that

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:55.670
that slob in town. Why aren't
you being punished as well?

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:59.574
I ve never been married, Brooks.
And when I do marry

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:02.544
someone, I doubt he's gonna be
from a place like this.

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.245
What are you talking about?

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:08.450
You know, as a feminist, I
abhor men like you.

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:13.955
Ohhh, so you're a feminist now?
Is that it? Huh! Where did ya

01:08:13.956 --> 01:08:18.426
learn that? Metropolitan
Magazine? Oh, no, wait...

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:19.894
it's probably Oprah, wasn't it?

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.729
Actually, it was at Harvard.

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:27.836
Harvard! Don't make laugh!
Harvard!

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:32.372
Harvard undergrad and Princeton

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:34.242
Who are you?

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:38.613
I'm Heather Smith. Your
wife's second cousin.

01:08:38.613 --> 01:08:42.817

us to be meeting like this but

of the two family functions I've
attended since you married

01:08:45.453 --> 01:08:49.524
Amanda, you were too busy
playing golf with your

01:08:49.524 --> 01:08:55.430
Bitch! You lied to me! You
told me your name was Heather

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:57.932
Gratzer from Eatonville.
That s what you told me!

01:08:57.933 --> 01:09:02.337
Every man alone is sincere.

me what the fuck is going on!

This is an old company town,
silly. Smith Northwestern

hate people like you.

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:20.421
Although I can t say I really
blame them for that.

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:22.357
What did you show up for then?
Huh?

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:25.993
I just came here to let you know
how much I despise you and

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.962
how repulsive I found sex
with you to be.

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:33.268
Yeah... and maybe just to also
let you know how much I'm

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:36.939
gonna enjoy your punishment.

01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:40.041
Wait... wait! Where are
you going?

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:43.745
Oh, and one more thing, I
happen to be a contributor

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:47.549
to Metropolitan Magazine and,
contrary to what you may

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:53.654
believe, I don't hate all men,
just you. Bye

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:59.495

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:46.534
What are you talking about? I
haven't done anything wrong.

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:49.137
I'll take that as a plea of not
guilty, Mr. Caldwell.

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:52.040
A plea to what? I don't even
know what I've been

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:56.979
Let the record record that the
accused pleads not guilty.

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:00.815
Will the worthy Sargent-at-Arms
please bring in the first

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:02.584
witness.

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:11.793
His sexual proclivities, I would
say they were demented,

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:16.731
if not perverse. Just being
around him, made me nauseous,

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:19.867
his slightest touch made the
hairs on the back of my neck

01:12:19.868 --> 01:12:24.038
stand up in disgust. Yet,
somehow, I just kept

01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:27.875
reminding myself how important
this was for my dear cousin.

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:32.547
And I managed to find the
strength to go on... It was

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:34.582
the fact that he could leave me
there for dead...

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.950
I was entrapped.

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:38.186
Now, Greta, you re sure Mr.
Caldwell was trying to

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:40.488
lure you up to his room for sex?

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:45.159
Ohh, yes. In his last call down
to the office, he insisted there

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.863
was a problem which needed
my immediate attention.

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:50.765
What.. what exactly was
the problem?

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:55.570
He said there was an issue with
the springs in his bed mattress

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:59.040
and he wanted me to come up
and look at them.

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:03.044
Oh, that is absurd. I mean, look
at her! Does anyone think for

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.812
a minute that I would have
anything to do with that

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:08.716
Mr. Caldwell, this is your last
warning! This tribunal will

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:11.687
tolerate no further out-
bursts from you!

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.021
It was his beady eyes that
creeped me out more than

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:16.724
anything. Bedroom eyes
you might call them.

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:18.025
Can you be more specific?

01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:21.729
The way he stared, like he was
undressing me with his eyes.

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:24.499
I felt like I was being
visually raped by this man.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.801
I was only able to drive him
away at gun point and I shudder

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:28.936
to think what he might of done
to me if I had not made it to

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:30.271
my shotgun in time.

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:33.541
I just wanted to borrow her car!

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:35.611
Silence that man!

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:39.147
Gentlemen, I see no useful
purpose in hearing further

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:42.617
testimony. I think we've delved
quite sufficiently into the

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:47.889
seedy, sordid world of this
depraved man. You have

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:50.825
been confronted today with
incontrovertible evidence

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:53.961
of your own licentious and
perverted conduct. And you,

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:59.066
Mr. Caldwell, stand accused
by your Creator. I now put

01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:03.104
the question to the full Lodge.
All those in favor of

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.672
a guilty verdict?

01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:12.673
Guilty. Guilty....

01:14:19.688 --> 01:14:23.324
Brooks Caldwell, you have been
found guilty of adultery,

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:27.028
spousal abandonment, lechery,
and inflicting mental anguish

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:30.264
all against the peace and
dignity of a community member.

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:36.705
You've sown the wind, Sir, and
now you will reap the whirlwind.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:46.648
DOORS CAN BE HEARD
OPENING.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.356
Amanda. Amanda!

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:58.359
Mrs. Caldwell, you wish
to address the tribunal?

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.729
Yes, I do.

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:14.742
You know Brooks, you were
nothing when I met you,

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:18.813
just another obscure young
lawyer in the big city.

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:20.681
I'm sorry, Honey.

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:25.219
All the exclusive clubs that you
spend so much time away at,

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:28.222
you would have never gotten
into, if you hadn't married

01:15:28.223 --> 01:15:29.957
into my family.

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:32.393
I, I... I know I have
problems...

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:36.697
All the clients my father sends
you... all the vacations

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:41.903
and homes and everything else,
all because you're married

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:48.242
I promise that I will, I'll seek
whatever counseling is

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:51.812
necessary if you would just
give me one more chance.

01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:56.651
You know the worst of it,
Brooks? Your complete lack

01:15:56.652 --> 01:16:01.088
of respect for me, I gave you
everything you could have

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:06.661
ever wanted and when I was
most vulnerable, you took

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:10.197
advantage of me and betrayed
my trust. And even worse, you

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:14.735
thought I was too dumb, too
inept to figure out what

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:15.770
you were up to.

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:19.907
I asking you to... to
forgive me, please.

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:23.711
Yes, Brooks, I can forgive you.

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:26.981
Thank you...
Thank you.

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:28.950
But I cannot let you go
unpunished for what

01:16:28.951 --> 01:16:30.051
you have done.

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:32.220
What do you mean, punished?

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:47.828
CROWD CHEERS

01:17:10.058 --> 01:17:11.459
How you doing Counselor?

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.829
You gotta help me.
Make them stop.

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:17.832
Sorry, Kid. Once the bull
craps, you can't stuff

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:19.300
it back inside.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:20.434
Please...

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:24.271
It'll be quick.
I promise.

01:17:24.272 --> 01:17:25.240
Mark! Mark!

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:28.210
Hey, Take our picture.

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:34.116
Oooh.

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:35.850
Okay, Man, got it.

01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:38.085
Check the screen, make sure
my eyes weren't closed.

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:41.956
Yeah, man, you guys look great.

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:43.257
Wha.. why are you doing this?

01:17:43.258 --> 01:17:46.160
Hey, man. Don t take it
personally. I mean they were

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:51.465
going to do you anyway. It's
just that well, they said if I

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:54.035
participated they'd let me out
of that stinking cell for

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:55.403
a couple of hours.

01:17:55.404 --> 01:17:58.973
Help me... please,
help me.

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:01.476
Sorry, Man, I gotta go.

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:07.082
CHEERS ERUPT

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:23.898
Brothers and Sisters! This
wretch before you today stands

01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:28.269
convicted of despicable and
heinous crimes against the

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:33.908
community. There can be only one
punishment for such crimes. It

01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:37.879
is not of our making, it is as
our God demands.

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:42.583
Was it not Jesus who said,
"Let he who is without sin,

01:18:42.584 --> 01:18:45.220
cast the first stone?"

01:18:45.987 --> 01:18:48.589
How fortuitous of you to say so,
Mr. Caldwell. It just so

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:53.194
happens that we have an honored
and, I might say, appropriate,

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:57.499
guest to cast that very
first stone.

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:07.075
Amanda... What are you doing?
Make them stop.

01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:14.149
Citizens of Creechville,
perform your duty!

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:26.353
No... Amanda, No, No, No...
NOOOOOOOO!

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:38.472
Heather? Heather?

01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:40.107
What's wrong, Brooks?

01:19:40.108 --> 01:19:43.310
Oh, thank God! Thank,
God! It was just a

01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:46.347
dream! It's just a
dream!

01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:48.517
Uh, what's going on?

01:19:49.885 --> 01:19:57.885
A nightmare, but it was so
real... so, so vivid.

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.095
I'm sorry.

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:10.037
I'm done, Heather. I'm going
back to Amanda.

01:20:10.038 --> 01:20:11.672
Look, if this is about
last night.

01:20:11.673 --> 01:20:16.177
No... no. I m going to see a
priest first. I m going to go

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:19.380
to confession. I'm going to
go to confession and

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:22.349
then I m going to come clean to
my wife, and beg her not to

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:23.551
leave me. Yeah.

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:25.319
What are you talking about?

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:29.323
I've been a terrible husband.
But that's all going to change.

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:31.193
Starting today.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.195
DOOR SOUND

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:38.098
Amanda! How'd you find me?
Wha.. what are you doing here?

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:40.568
I put a GPS tracker on your car!

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:41.936
Didn't your mommy and
daddy ever teach you

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:43.338
to knock?

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.472
Wha... whoa, what are you doing?

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:47.408
This time it's loaded, Brooks.

01:20:47.409 --> 01:20:48.542
GUNSHOT

01:20:48.543 --> 01:20:49.344
FEMALE SCREAM

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:55.283
MORE GUNSHOTS

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:59.053
It happened so quickly! I
remember that sound.

01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:03.157
The thud of the first bullet.
I was shot four times. One

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:05.192
of the doctors called my
survival a miracle from

01:21:05.193 --> 01:21:10.465
God. He said I was blessed.
Yet, I hardly feel blessed.

01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:16.237
- I had the world by the balls.
- I had more money than I

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:23.978
knew what to do with. A
respected lawyer, in demand,

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:28.115
and my wife was beautiful from
a wealthy family of timber

01:21:28.116 --> 01:21:34.089
barons and then I threw it all
away.

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:43.565
Hi Brooks. Whaddya say,
we change out that catheter?

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:54.174
Yeah, I guess you could say
it's the screwing I get for

01:21:54.175 --> 01:21:58.146
the screwing I got...
