He's got an in
with the detective,

00:27.995 --> 00:29.763
he can get the chip back
with minimal fuss.

have to arrest me,

you didn't know
how it was gonna end.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.051
No.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.089
What were you thinking about?

33:52.431 --> 33:55.101
I was thinking about making it
through the next moment.

33:56.635 --> 33:59.738
Then the next,
the next.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.642
I mean, honestly,
I was thinking about living.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.548
I'll drink to that.

34:15.254 --> 34:16.255
(SIGHS)

34:23.662 --> 34:25.597
My mother, um,

34:25.631 --> 34:28.267
she used to make
this bebinca.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.703
It's like a sweet,
sweet dessert,

34:32.238 --> 34:33.539
and her grandmother
used to make it

34:33.572 --> 34:35.307
for her as a kid in Goa.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.377
And the customers loved it.

34:39.678 --> 34:44.850
And after she died, my dad,
he tried to make it,

34:44.883 --> 34:47.553
but it wasn't any good.

34:47.886 --> 34:51.190
But the customers kept coming,
out of respect for her.

34:52.258 --> 34:53.659
And they never had the heart
to tell my dad

34:53.692 --> 34:54.726
it tasted like shit.

34:54.760 --> 34:55.761
(CHUCKLES)

34:59.931 --> 35:01.900
He eventually got it
so it was passable,

35:01.933 --> 35:05.537
but it was not like hers.

35:08.174 --> 35:09.841
It was the last thing
she ever cooked.

35:14.413 --> 35:15.781
She got lymphoma.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.485
And it came on
out of nowhere.

35:19.518 --> 35:20.852
It was really fast.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.457
And one day,
she's lying in bed,

35:26.492 --> 35:27.626
she's so weak,

35:27.659 --> 35:29.595
and this thing kicked
the crap out of her.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.363
She was a ghost
even before she died.

35:34.333 --> 35:39.205
Anyway, I was sitting there
and I asked her

35:41.440 --> 35:43.275
if she was scared of dying.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.578
And I was seven,

35:46.612 --> 35:48.780
I didn't know what the fuck
I was talking about.

35:50.449 --> 35:51.883
And you know what she said?

35:54.220 --> 35:55.421
She said...

35:57.756 --> 35:59.858
"I never think about dying.

36:02.261 --> 36:04.396
"I only ever
think about living."

36:12.904 --> 36:13.905
Yeah.

36:16.242 --> 36:17.376

just ask me that?

36:58.850 --> 37:00.218

Okay. So Theresa Archer is
the CEO of Ombello Group.

37:25.444 --> 37:26.645
Management consultants.

37:26.678 --> 37:28.680
I interviewed her
after Daniel Jameson died.

37:28.714 --> 37:29.881
He was her partner.

37:30.549 --> 37:31.850
Company comes up clean.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.419
They pay their taxes.

37:33.452 --> 37:34.986

local charities.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.688
Your model corporation.

37:36.722 --> 37:37.556
But get this...

37:37.589 --> 37:39.925
During the Iraq War,
she was a consultant

37:39.958 --> 37:41.627
for Bluewater
Private Security.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.295
They were big-time players
over there.

37:43.329 --> 37:46.532
After the War, they sent her
to the Green Zone in Baghdad.

37:46.565 --> 37:47.666
The Wild West.

37:47.699 --> 37:49.435
She was Bluewater's liaison

37:49.468 --> 37:51.703
to the Coalition
Provisional Authority,

37:51.737 --> 37:54.473
advising them on the use of
US private security.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.408
That's where she met Jameson.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.043
She told me they met
in the States.

37:58.076 --> 37:58.910
REGAN: Well, she lied.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.846
They made a shitload
of money over there,

38:00.879 --> 38:03.682
and they used it to set up
their own company, Ombello.

38:03.715 --> 38:04.783
Their two other partners,

38:04.816 --> 38:06.084
Garret Bledsoe
and Michael Reynolds,

38:06.117 --> 38:09.455
were also consultants
for the Coalition Authority.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.490
After the war,
their company made a killing.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.625
Their client roster ranges
from petroleum companies,

38:13.659 --> 38:15.994
software start-ups,
local government,

38:16.027 --> 38:18.063
local branches
of Federal agencies.

38:18.096 --> 38:19.798
What about
private security companies?

38:19.831 --> 38:20.832
REGAN: Two.

38:20.866 --> 38:23.001
The ones that Theresa was
working for in Baghdad?

38:23.402 --> 38:24.736
Well, they've changed
their names

38:24.770 --> 38:27.005
to bury the stink of
their activities over there,

38:27.038 --> 38:28.407
but essentially, yes.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.509
What about the guy
she gave the chip to?

38:30.542 --> 38:32.911
Couldn't get an ID on him,
but the plates on the vehicle?

38:32.944 --> 38:34.012
They're military.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.081
Jesus.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.451
Why can't we arrest her?

38:39.485 --> 38:40.519
For what?

38:41.052 --> 38:42.588
I don't know. Torture.

38:42.621 --> 38:43.655
Did you see it?

38:44.590 --> 38:45.657
No, I...

38:45.691 --> 38:47.693
Then it's Ethan's word
against hers.

38:47.726 --> 38:50.028
We have her on camera
taking possession of the chip.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.797

38:52.063 --> 38:53.064

38:55.066 --> 38:58.670
Look, we saw what these
people were capable of

38:58.704 --> 38:59.738
when they killed Oaks.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.039
We know
they have a long reach.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.574
But if we go after them
half-cocked,

39:02.608 --> 39:04.443
they'll have an army
of over-priced lawyers

39:04.476 --> 39:05.744
tying us up in litigation

39:05.777 --> 39:07.846
before we even get
close to this thing.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.848
Meanwhile,
whoever else is involved

39:09.881 --> 39:11.817
has plenty of time
to disappear.

39:13.552 --> 39:14.720
What do you suggest?

39:16.755 --> 39:18.056
Well, this morning,
we didn't know

39:18.089 --> 39:19.491
who these people were.

39:19.825 --> 39:22.628
Now you're in with them.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.996
You're essentially
an undercover operative.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.097
Yeah.

39:26.131 --> 39:27.733

39:32.103 --> 39:33.939
That way, when we move in
to make arrests,

39:33.972 --> 39:35.140
our case is iron-fucking-clad

39:35.173 --> 39:36.642
and these pricks have
nowhere to run.

39:36.675 --> 39:37.676

39:37.709 --> 39:38.644

a bunch of dirty cops.

just got immeasurably longer,

39:45.817 --> 39:48.454

who wait their whole lives

at a case like this.

we don't know when,

41:19.645 --> 41:20.779
he's gonna show up
at this motel

41:20.812 --> 41:24.683
to sell approximately two keys
of Mexican black tar heroin

41:24.716 --> 41:26.618
to a man named Victor Young.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.755
Now, the amount
doesn't concern us.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.658
What concerns us is that
Victor Young is operating

41:32.691 --> 41:33.925

41:35.661 --> 41:37.262
