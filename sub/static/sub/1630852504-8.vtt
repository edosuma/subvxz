00:01.168 --> 00:01.900
(kelly): Sorry I wasn't
the greatest company.

00:01.936 --> 00:02.901
I'll make it up to you Friday.

00:02.970 --> 00:04.636
- Actually can't do Friday.

00:04.772 --> 00:05.670
- You have a date.

00:05.740 --> 00:07.639
- If you're ready to be real
with me,

00:07.641 --> 00:08.573
I will cancel those plans.

00:08.642 --> 00:09.707
- I feel like a real gangster,

00:09.744 --> 00:11.510
Talking business with
the infamous randy bowen.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.578
- But I am gonna have to have
a couple of my guys

00:13.647 --> 00:14.780
Thrown in the mix.

00:14.849 --> 00:17.850
So I want jackie and shaggy here
to be my point people.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.953
- You got the money out, right?
- No. Cops got everything.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.389
- What are you doing here?

00:24.392 --> 00:25.791
- You said you'd have my money
by Friday.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.392
(gunshot)
(tiggy, gasping): Please!

00:27.395 --> 00:29.528
Best mdma money can buy.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.964
- Randy bowen,
you're under arrest!

00:31.966 --> 00:33.999
- I don't even know who the hell
this nelson guy is.

00:34.134 --> 00:35.033
- We do.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.401
- I saw the surveillance
footage.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.736
- The guy was guilty.

00:37.871 --> 00:38.970
- But you beat up a kid!

00:39.006 --> 00:40.472
You might want
to take a look at this.

00:42.175 --> 00:43.775
You went out for the ds job,

00:43.811 --> 00:45.210
You didn't think
to mention it to me?

00:45.246 --> 00:46.745
- We can talk about it
over dinner.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.880
- Why don't you save it
for your new Friday night?

00:48.916 --> 00:49.748
- I didn't get it.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.082
- Want to get drunk?

00:51.118 --> 00:53.251
- Yeah.
- Come on.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.354
Okay. Okay.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.495
(soft music)

01:04.865 --> 01:06.965
(kelly groans)
(sam gasps)

01:06.967 --> 01:09.034
(kelly): Mm-mm-mm.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.373
- What'd we do?

01:15.843 --> 01:17.643
- I don't know.
I'm still putting it together.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.577
I hurt my lip.

01:19.613 --> 01:23.114
- My head is so... So bad.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.916
- Oh, I remember now.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.051
(sam sighs)

01:26.053 --> 01:28.387
I bought this ugly-ass pantsuit
from insta-cart.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.321
- Okay.
(kelly chuckles)

01:30.324 --> 01:32.858
- Duff, what a...
What am I doing in your clothes?

01:32.860 --> 01:34.927
- Well, at least you look cool.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.728
- I remember now.
We went to a pub, and then,

01:36.730 --> 01:38.796
We got into a fight with
two girls in the washroom.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.466
Oh my god. We got into a fight
with two girls in the washroom.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.935
- Hm. Served them right.

01:43.070 --> 01:45.203
Telling us we too old to do
a toosie slide. Pfft.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.306
- I'm so old I don't know
what the toosie slide is.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.941
- You remembered it
last night.

01:49.076 --> 01:50.409
- Wha--
- remember, we did this?

01:50.544 --> 01:52.477
And then, you just, like,
hit it like that, one time.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.112
(kelly groans)
- I don't remember.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.548
- Pfft! I could go for
some ketchup chips.

01:56.683 --> 01:58.016
- Oh god!

01:58.018 --> 01:59.618
I'm gonna be late!

01:59.620 --> 02:01.153
- No!
- I'm gonna be late!

02:01.222 --> 02:02.888
I'm gonna be, like, yeah,

02:02.890 --> 02:05.357
This is a great first impression
on the ds, thank you very much.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.825
(kelly gasping loudly)

02:07.728 --> 02:08.927
What?
- Oh my god.

02:08.929 --> 02:09.962
- What?!

02:10.097 --> 02:12.064
- I think we did some
drunk dialling last night.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.266
- What?
- I think we called naz...

02:14.335 --> 02:17.168
And asked him if he had
robin hood by the bag.

02:17.204 --> 02:18.103
- Oh god!

02:19.140 --> 02:20.271
You bring out the worst in me.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.106
- No, you do that
to yourself.

02:22.143 --> 02:23.708
But one thing's for sure,

02:23.777 --> 02:26.445
If we were 10 years old,
our parents would never...

02:26.580 --> 02:27.913
Let us hang out together.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.848
- Your parents would love me.
- They wouldn't.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.918
(gasping): Duff, I remember!

02:32.987 --> 02:34.186
Gimme a beat!

02:35.289 --> 02:37.789
- Bing, bong, bing, bong,
bing, bong.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.925
Bing, bong, bing,
goodni--

02:39.927 --> 02:40.992
You're already not on beat.

02:41.061 --> 02:41.793
(retching)
ugh!

02:41.862 --> 02:43.195
- Oh god!
(retching)

02:43.197 --> 02:44.129
- I can smell your breath.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.397
Ugh! I can taste it!

02:45.466 --> 02:48.267
(♪ I will survive ♪ playing)

02:54.641 --> 02:57.242
- Anyways, I don't want
to come in, step on any toes,

02:57.244 --> 03:00.144
Rearrange the furniture,
but... As an outside eye,

03:00.181 --> 03:03.215
I do see room for improvements
in guns and gangs.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.817
- Excuse me.
Uh, so sorry to interrupt.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.286
Where is there room
for improvement?

03:07.421 --> 03:09.488
- We could start
by not being late.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.523
- Unavoidable. I do apologize.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.892
- Long coffee lineup,
huh, wazowski?

03:13.961 --> 03:15.160
- Uh...

03:15.295 --> 03:17.395
I would really like to say
that I am so happy

03:17.431 --> 03:19.031
That you do not want
to rearrange the furniture.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.399
If that's the case,
what I'm wondering is,

03:20.401 --> 03:22.701
Why did you actually rearrange
the furniture?

03:22.836 --> 03:24.202
- I was speaking metaphorically.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.138
I did move my desk to a spot

03:26.140 --> 03:27.572
That I thought was
more accessible.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.708
- Uh, I like the new spot,
personally.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.042
- Speaking in metaphor,

03:31.078 --> 03:33.278
Well, that risks
misinterpretation.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.280
You may feel that your desk
is more accessible,

03:35.316 --> 03:37.015
I feel - and
she definitely feels -

03:37.084 --> 03:38.684
That it's a little bit
"micromanagy."

03:38.819 --> 03:40.252
- Alright. Well...

03:40.321 --> 03:41.920
If we're gonna get this
stockwood crew wrapped up,

03:42.055 --> 03:43.188
Let's get this show
on the road.

03:43.323 --> 03:44.155
- Okay, more figurative
language.

03:44.225 --> 03:45.724
To be clear, he means let's--
- sam.

03:45.726 --> 03:46.792
- Yeah?
- Let's get to work.

03:46.927 --> 03:47.726
- Yes.

03:50.698 --> 03:53.398
(indistinct office chatter)

03:58.639 --> 03:59.805
(kelly): Hey, gabrielle.

04:00.674 --> 04:01.607
- Oh, hey.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.641
(coins clicking)

04:02.643 --> 04:04.076
- I'm dying for ketchup chips.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.444
- Weird.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.679
Me too.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.216
- Tsk! Ugh! Damn it.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.018
(tara): Homicide,
coming through.

04:14.454 --> 04:16.021
(door buzzing)

04:16.023 --> 04:18.490
(soft music)

04:18.559 --> 04:21.092
<i> (tara): Ms. Marks, you spent</i>
<i> the last couple of years</i>

04:21.161 --> 04:24.829
<i> Working for randy bowen</i>
<i> at his glass factory,</i>

04:24.865 --> 04:26.365
<i> Did he make any enemies?</i>

04:26.367 --> 04:28.367
<i> (danica): I mean,</i>
<i> nobody liked randy.</i>

04:28.502 --> 04:31.503
<i> (tara): I already know that.</i>
<i> (kelly): Danica marks.</i>

04:31.638 --> 04:33.404
Now, how are you
out on bail again?

04:33.440 --> 04:36.441
<i> - We found drugs on the body</i>
<i> of randy bowen.</i>

04:36.576 --> 04:39.477
<i>Forensics confirmed it was mdma.</i>

04:39.479 --> 04:42.781
<i> This particular mdma</i>
<i> contains spores</i>

04:42.783 --> 04:45.383
<i> From one</i>
<i> protea grandicolour.</i>

04:45.519 --> 04:46.685
<i> - Who?</i>

04:46.820 --> 04:49.121
<i> (chase): Proteas are</i>
<i> a tropical flower.</i>

04:49.256 --> 04:50.956
<i> Quite uncommon</i>
<i> north of the border.</i>

04:52.693 --> 04:54.793
<i> - If you don't want to talk,</i>
<i> that's fine.</i>

04:54.862 --> 04:56.395
<i> I've already given</i>
<i> this information</i>

04:56.397 --> 04:57.796
<i> To my colleagues in drug squad</i>

04:57.865 --> 04:59.597
<i> Who are following up on it</i>
<i> as we speak.</i>

04:59.633 --> 05:00.665
<i> - That's bad.</i>

05:00.734 --> 05:02.934
<i> - Very bad.</i>
<i> We haven't released you,</i>

05:02.936 --> 05:05.003
<i> In any way, shape or form.</i>
<i> You're staying in here.</i>

05:05.639 --> 05:07.939
(office chatter,
telephone ringing)

05:08.075 --> 05:08.874
- Hey.

05:10.444 --> 05:13.611
Did homicide call you about
the mdma capsules they found

05:13.681 --> 05:14.746
On randy bowen's body?

05:14.881 --> 05:16.214
- No, why?

05:16.216 --> 05:17.882
(mcconnell): Uh, yeah,
jimmy took that one.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.284
Your cocaine.

05:19.419 --> 05:20.852
- And jimmy's weed.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.420
Come on, you knew I found
randy bowen's body.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.222
You didn't think to hand over
the file to me?

05:24.224 --> 05:26.291
- Nope. I didn't.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.960
- Well, maybe you should have.
(davidson): Fine.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.495
Take it.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.798
- W--
(scoffing)

05:32.800 --> 05:33.999
Where's the file, davidson?

05:34.802 --> 05:36.668
- It's on my desk.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.139
(sighing)

05:43.277 --> 05:45.077
- Hey, davidson, you didn't get
too far on this, did you?

05:45.212 --> 05:47.212
- Okay, that's...
I keep hearing that.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.646
That's a...
You hear that squeaking sound?

05:48.682 --> 05:49.915
(mcconnell):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.316
Are we gonna have
to get pest control?

05:51.318 --> 05:52.584
Is that what we need to do?

05:52.653 --> 05:53.985
We might need to get
pest control.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.320
(davidson): Are you serious?
(mcconnell): Ah, squeakers.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.389
(kelly exhales loudly)

05:57.524 --> 06:00.057
(naz exhales):
You need help?

06:00.794 --> 06:04.061
- Yeah. Maybe you can pull up
all the flower shops in town

06:04.098 --> 06:05.496
That sell proteas?

06:05.532 --> 06:06.932
Some kind of tropical flower.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.668
They found pollen
on the mdma capsules.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.770
So we need to start
by finding a connection

06:11.772 --> 06:13.871
Between the flower shops
and randy bowen.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.475
Maybe even pull in hamm...
Ah!

06:17.711 --> 06:19.677
(davidson): Whoa.
Where'd that come from?

06:19.747 --> 06:20.679
(mcconnell): No idea.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.079
- Naz!
- You think this is funny?

06:22.116 --> 06:23.548
Why don't you be funny
with me, huh?!

06:23.683 --> 06:24.749
- It's fine, it's fine!
(officers chuckling)

06:24.818 --> 06:26.418
It doesn't bother me.
Here, give it to me.

06:26.887 --> 06:27.953
(scoffing)

06:28.088 --> 06:30.455
It's not 1982.
This isn't serpico.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.056
I will not be bullied.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.626
(davidson): Go on... Snitch.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.261
(mcconnell): Ooh-ah!

06:38.799 --> 06:40.766
- Absolutely.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.768
And you know what else,
davidson?

06:43.570 --> 06:45.237
When you act like a child,

06:45.372 --> 06:46.771
I won't have to tell
the teacher.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.907
- Ooh...
- Asshole.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.748
(kelly sighs)
- ah!

06:58.786 --> 06:59.584
- Yep.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.052
- Do we know who did it?

07:01.054 --> 07:03.021
- I can't say for sure.
Mcconnell, davidson.

07:03.090 --> 07:03.988
Both of 'em!

07:04.024 --> 07:06.158
- I'll open an investigation.
- Sorry.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.792
I just can't believe that
there are cops out there

07:07.861 --> 07:09.527
Who think we should still be
covering up for each other.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.397
- I know, kelly, I know.
(kelly exhales)

07:13.967 --> 07:15.266
You know, maybe you need
a change?

07:15.302 --> 07:16.668
Get out of drug squad.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.736
There are other departments
you can do good work in.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.438
- Oh, no, no!
It's not drug squad,

07:20.441 --> 07:23.608
It's the entire mentality
of this place!

07:24.878 --> 07:26.411
(softly): Sorry.

07:27.481 --> 07:28.847
(sighs)

07:29.683 --> 07:31.616
Drug squad is my home.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.750
You know, me and naz,

07:32.786 --> 07:34.419
We bring a lot of integrity
to that team.

07:34.554 --> 07:35.821
I just can't bail on him.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.291
- Fifteen years ago,
I worked vice,

07:40.360 --> 07:44.095
And my partner
was a racist prick.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.163
He was a real bully.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.898
He made me want to quit
the force.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.667
- Right. So what'd you do
about it?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.237
-<i> I</i> became his boss.

07:52.306 --> 07:54.239
(chuckling)

07:54.241 --> 07:56.508
- And you still have
to clean up his messes.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.976
- But now, they pay me
a lot of money to do it.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.845
(laughter)
(door opens)

08:00.914 --> 08:04.949
(sam moans and groans)

08:04.985 --> 08:06.718
- A: Why didn't anybody
tell me

08:06.720 --> 08:08.320
That a hangover
feels this way?

08:08.322 --> 08:10.655
B: Hamm is eating garlic bread
at his desk,

08:10.724 --> 08:12.123
And it's just making me feel
really...

08:12.192 --> 08:14.326
Like, not good, like, really,
really nauseous.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.060
And c:
Detective sergeant greene

08:16.096 --> 08:18.129
Really seems to think
that he is my boss.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.163
- He is your boss.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.565
- Yeah, but he doesn't need
to flaunt it.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.467
Sorensen, he just, like,
left me alone

08:22.602 --> 08:24.536
And he kind of just, like,
let me do my thing.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.471
- Which you complained about
ad nauseam.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.940
- I cannot believe I'm gonna
say this, but I was wrong.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.742
- Look, nathan's a good guy.
He'll run a tight ship.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.243
- Perfect. That's great.
You take him.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.279
(scoffing): Anybody better
than mcconnell.

08:34.348 --> 08:35.680
Sitting around,
playing cards all day,

08:35.815 --> 08:37.214
Hiding rats in people's desks.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.950
- He put a rat in your desk?

08:40.153 --> 08:41.686
'cause of keegan?

08:42.489 --> 08:44.856
I f... And I came in here
with a...

08:46.260 --> 08:47.425
Duff, I'm s...
I'm so sorry.

08:47.461 --> 08:49.227
- That's alright.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.362
We used to it.
- Hm.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.696
(duff): Anyway, I gotta
get back to work.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.264
Look, I found a lead
on those mdma pills

08:53.333 --> 08:54.833
Found on randy bowen's body.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.101
Want to come?

08:56.103 --> 08:57.835
- I have to clear it with
my overbearing boss first,

08:57.837 --> 08:58.703
But yeah.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.273
- Hey, kel?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.276
I'll handle this, okay?

09:05.345 --> 09:06.978
- Thank you.
(softly): Uh-huh.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.681
- So, there are not many
flower shops in town

09:09.816 --> 09:12.050
That carry proteas,
especially this time of year.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.718
But we did find
an interesting connection

09:13.787 --> 09:16.988
Between one flower shop
and your boy, randy bowen.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.323
- What's that?

09:18.392 --> 09:20.191
- When we were canvassing
the area

09:20.227 --> 09:21.926
After we found
randy bowen's body,

09:21.995 --> 09:25.196
I talked to a woman who actually
stayed at that motel

09:25.265 --> 09:29.200
And... She took a picture
of her fiancé...

09:29.236 --> 09:30.735
In the parking lot.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.871
Why you would take a picture
in the parking lot is beyond me.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.006
I mean, you could see
the ac unit...

09:35.075 --> 09:36.541
Look at his complexion, like,

09:36.676 --> 09:38.676
She needs to learn about filt--
(kelly clears her throat)

09:38.812 --> 09:41.712
U-uh, anyhoo,
<i> this</i> is randy's room.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.882
And this car was parked outside
for a few hours

09:44.918 --> 09:46.484
Three days
before he was killed.

09:46.553 --> 09:47.886
(sighing): Okay.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.420
Get over here.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.022
I can't... I can't see
the license plate.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.157
What does the sign thingy say?
- Ah!

09:53.927 --> 09:56.027
(naz): That's...
Cortina couriers.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.229
And they have an account
with gaia flowers.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.296
It's over on wilson.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.566
- And gaia flowers
carries proteas.

10:01.568 --> 10:02.634
Pro-te-as?

10:02.703 --> 10:03.835
Proteas.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.737
- One of the only shops
in town that does.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.038
- Okay. So, who's dealing
the drugs?

10:07.074 --> 10:08.840
Is it couriers,
is it the flower shop?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.441
- Either, or.

10:10.477 --> 10:11.709
And they could be
in it together.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.710
- Okay, let's do this.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.378
Let's go... Pay a visit
to gaia flowers.

10:14.414 --> 10:15.580
Naz, would you like
to come along?

10:15.715 --> 10:18.450
- No, I can't, I, uh...
I gotta go talk to shanks.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.918
She's investigating
the department.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.386
- Investigating what department?

10:21.521 --> 10:22.754
- All departments.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.622
Trying to root out this, uh,
old-boys' club

10:24.757 --> 10:26.124
That seems to be rampant
around here.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.859
- What old-boys' club?

10:27.928 --> 10:28.860
- It's not really a club,

10:28.995 --> 10:29.928
It's more of a mentality, barry.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.129
People who ostracize and
intimidate anyone

10:32.165 --> 10:34.265
Who speaks out against a cop
that breaks the law.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.466
Do you know any guys
like that?

10:35.535 --> 10:38.135
- Hm. No...
I... Hate those guys.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.104
- Really?

10:39.239 --> 10:41.906
- We... I mean... Don't we?
(chuckles)

10:41.942 --> 10:44.742
Or-or do we like them?
(naz): Anyway...

10:44.778 --> 10:47.612
When I'm done, backbone barry
and I over here will check out

10:47.614 --> 10:48.947
Cortina couriers.
(sam): Okay.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.882
(overlapping conversation)

10:50.884 --> 10:51.916
Ouch!

10:53.953 --> 10:54.952
- I'm just saying.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.654
(sam): Naz has done a lot
of work on the case,

10:56.657 --> 10:57.922
So I thought
that maybe... Oh!

10:57.924 --> 11:00.258
Hey, ds greene, we have a break
in the stockwood case.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.559
It involves recon
at gaia flowers,

11:01.628 --> 11:03.695
So we were just gonna head out.
- Good. That's fine.

11:03.830 --> 11:04.996
Just before you go,

11:05.065 --> 11:06.965
I was wondering if I could
get your help solving a case.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.067
I'm trying to identify...

11:09.136 --> 11:11.703
These late-night callers.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.238
<i> (kelly, loudly): Hey, you!</i>

11:13.373 --> 11:14.839
<i> Greene! Greeney-bean!</i>

11:14.841 --> 11:16.507
<i>(sam): Bicycle shorts are dorky</i>
<i> and even I know that,</i>

11:16.543 --> 11:18.309
<i> And I'm the biggest dork</i>
<i> in town!</i>

11:18.311 --> 11:19.577
<i> (kelly): Bicycle shorts</i>
<i> are so dorky,</i>

11:19.613 --> 11:21.146
<i> Plus you snore in your sleep!</i>

11:21.281 --> 11:22.714
<i> (sam): Of course,</i>
<i> he snores in his sleep,</i>

11:22.783 --> 11:23.848
<i> 'cause you can't snore</i>
<i> when you're awake.</i>

11:23.983 --> 11:25.650
<i> (kelly): Yes, you can!</i>
<i> (sam): No, you can't!</i>

11:25.785 --> 11:27.085
<i> (kelly): I've seen it.</i>
<i> So, anyway,</i>

11:27.087 --> 11:29.788
<i>You have good luck with whoever</i>
<i> your new Friday night is,</i>

11:29.790 --> 11:31.856
<i> 'cause whatever she is, she</i>
<i>can't hold a candle to the duff.</i>

11:31.925 --> 11:33.324
Okay, okay, funny.
(greene laughs)

11:33.360 --> 11:34.391
Ha, ha.

11:34.428 --> 11:36.394
- At least I was on your mind
last night.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.129
- Okay, maybe. A little bit.
(sam): Duff...

11:38.198 --> 11:39.230
- What?

11:39.365 --> 11:41.599
- I sounded really loose, like,
really relaxed.

11:41.635 --> 11:44.135
- Maybe you should drink more.
- Maybe I should.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.270
(kelly): Uh-huh.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.071
Alright, let's head
to gaia flowers.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.674
(jackie): You don't have
to do this, you know.

11:49.809 --> 11:53.011
It's not your mom's life
being threatened by the mafia.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.280
- Yeah. I know. But...

11:56.650 --> 11:58.015
We're in this together,
right?

11:58.552 --> 12:00.652
- You know, when my mom
does this mdma deal,

12:00.787 --> 12:02.420
She can get buffalo
off her back,

12:02.489 --> 12:03.755
And then we can
get out of this,

12:03.757 --> 12:06.224
Start fresh.
Get our cut.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.860
- I think I gotta go to work,
or they're gonna kill me.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.862
- I gotta go hang out with
some really boring girls

12:10.997 --> 12:13.832
And bag mdma capsules,
otherwise...

12:14.434 --> 12:15.699
(sighing)

12:15.736 --> 12:17.302
...I'm pretty sure
they're gonna kill me too.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.844
(rhythmic music)

12:29.516 --> 12:31.382
- Hey.
- Hello.

12:31.451 --> 12:36.087
- I'm, uh, here to pick up
a sunshine special for...

12:36.089 --> 12:37.555
A. Conda.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.859
- A sunshine special...

12:41.795 --> 12:43.294
Yeah. There you go.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.064
One sunshine special.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.400
- Cool.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.173
Thank you.
<i> - De nada.</i>

13:00.347 --> 13:02.347
Ic)

13:13.626 --> 13:15.626
- Hi! Yeah, those are for me.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.295
I've been waiting out here
for over an hour already.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.763
- Anna conda. Nice.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.332
- Your car is fire.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.135
(girls giggling)

13:24.137 --> 13:25.036
- Oh, hilarious.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.037
(girl): Loser, right?

13:26.039 --> 13:27.806
- I friggin' hate
this town, man.

13:34.648 --> 13:35.747
(exhales loudly)

13:40.319 --> 13:42.820
- It's like a colonic,
without having to pay for it.

13:42.856 --> 13:43.788
(cellphone ringing)
- oh, god.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.423
Oh, it's elliot.
Hold on.

13:46.660 --> 13:47.692
Shh, shh, shh.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.063
<i> (elliot): Hey, mom.</i>
- Hey, elliot, how are you?

13:52.065 --> 13:53.130
<i> - I'm driving your car...</i>

13:53.266 --> 13:54.231
A lot.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.667
It's cool.
<i> - Oh yeah, really...</i>

13:55.802 --> 13:56.734
<i> It's not that bad, is it?</i>

13:56.870 --> 13:58.402
How are you?
Are you doing okay?

13:58.438 --> 13:59.804
Everything's alright?
How's living with your dad?

13:59.873 --> 14:00.872
<i> - He's never around, so...</i>

14:01.007 --> 14:03.140
I kinda have the place
to myself. So...

14:03.276 --> 14:05.844
<i> Uh, I got a job too.</i>
- What?

14:06.847 --> 14:08.145
Elliot, you got a job?

14:08.281 --> 14:10.648
<i> That's so good! Where?</i>

14:11.418 --> 14:12.617
- Uh...

14:13.419 --> 14:15.520
You know, I'll tell you
about it later, mom.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.689
<i> I gotta go, but...</i>
<i> I love you, okay?</i>

14:17.691 --> 14:19.657
- Okay. I love you so much.
I miss you.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.027
Okay, did I sound like
I care?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.629
'cause I want to be cool,
like I don't care.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.497
- Yup. You sound like
you cared a little bit.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.233
- It's more believable, anyway.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.336
He said my car was cool.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.372
- What? Pfft!
Girl, he was lying to you.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.073
There's nothing cool
about that car,

14:36.109 --> 14:38.276
Which is why it suits you
so well.

14:42.849 --> 14:43.715
Although...

14:43.850 --> 14:46.651
Last night, you were...
Kinda cool.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.252
- Really?

14:48.255 --> 14:49.387
I was cool?

14:49.389 --> 14:50.655
Like how? Like, how was I...

14:50.790 --> 14:52.790
What'd I do? Like, what'd I say?
- W-w... Not cool.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.459
Not cool. You were...

14:55.995 --> 14:57.128
You were fun.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.196
We had a good laugh.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.498
- That's great! Oh, god,
I wish I could remember it.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.466
Duff.
- Hm?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.068
- I think somebody
has to go in there.

15:04.671 --> 15:05.536
Can it be you?

15:05.572 --> 15:06.938
Because I really
don't want to move.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.141
(annoyed): Fine.
(sam): Thank you.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.843
- Be right back.

15:13.012 --> 15:13.945
- I owe you.

15:15.782 --> 15:16.614
(exhaling loudly)

15:17.550 --> 15:19.417
(hip-hop music)

15:20.687 --> 15:21.552
<i> (man): Hola!</i>

15:21.621 --> 15:22.887
Welcome to gaia flowers,

15:23.022 --> 15:25.222
Where every bloom
is a symbol of love.

15:25.224 --> 15:28.292
How can I help you today?
- Uh, I need some flowers

15:28.295 --> 15:29.894
For a funeral.

15:29.963 --> 15:32.096
- Oh, I am so sorry.
Who did you lose?

15:32.165 --> 15:34.432
- My third cousin.
On my granddad's side.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.368
- Okay, well, uh, no matter
how distant, death stings.

15:37.503 --> 15:40.071
Did you have anything in mind?

15:40.807 --> 15:42.974
- Pfft. I don't know. Uh...

15:42.976 --> 15:46.510
My cousin... Liked...
Proteas.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.678
You got any of those?

15:47.747 --> 15:49.213
- I certainly do.

15:49.215 --> 15:51.448
Very rare. Very beautiful.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.651
Your cousin had
excellent taste.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.652
Ah!

15:56.055 --> 15:57.722
- Great. I'll take six.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.190
(glass shatters)

15:59.325 --> 16:00.824
(sighing)

16:00.860 --> 16:01.859
- Bodhi, it's okay.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.361
Just grab a broom
from the closet.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.663
The vase was old, baby,
I was due to replace it.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.064
It's not a problem.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.233
Ay, ay, ay.
It's the third one this month.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.135
He's not the sharpest
tool in the shed.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.470
But he's loyal.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.072
He comes to work every day,
on time,

16:15.141 --> 16:17.008
And stays until the last order
is filled.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.809
Very hard to find workers
like this.

16:19.545 --> 16:22.213
- And, uh... Who's delivering
these?

16:22.215 --> 16:23.881
- Oh! We have a courier service.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.084
Very reliable.
Excellent drivers.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.652
You're in good hands.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.422
- Okay.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.825
I bet you some ketchup chips

16:33.960 --> 16:35.893
It's that sketchy dude
he got working in the back.

16:35.929 --> 16:38.529
Man, owner says he works
almost every day.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.797
Bodhi something.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.565
I think we should run his name.
(sam): Okay.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.935
Wai-wait, is that him?
(kelly): Uh, yep.

16:51.577 --> 16:52.976
Well, well, well,
will you look at that.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.212
You were right! Okay.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.980
Let's go arrest him, get him
to flip on the owner.

16:56.115 --> 16:57.315
- No, I don't think
it's the owner.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.449
I didn't catch that vibe
from him.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.317
- Really? Is that what
your crystal ball says?

17:00.353 --> 17:01.252
(kelly sighs)

17:01.321 --> 17:02.586
- We don't have enough
for an arrest.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.589
- W-we just witnessed
a drug transaction.

17:04.724 --> 17:05.990
- No, we just witnessed bodhi

17:06.059 --> 17:08.726
Put some... "plant food"
into a bouquet of flowers.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.461
- Oh, I see, and he keeps
the plant food fresh

17:10.596 --> 17:11.529
In his crotch. Great...

17:11.664 --> 17:13.197
- Can we just do it my way?

17:13.332 --> 17:14.965
I already got enough trouble
without you adding to it

17:15.035 --> 17:17.000
'cause you gotta prove that
they should've made you the ds.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.203
- That is only a tiny bit
what this is about.

17:19.338 --> 17:20.505
- Look, how 'bout
we just make it

17:20.640 --> 17:21.572
About finding the drugs,
okay?

17:21.608 --> 17:22.774
How 'bout that?

17:23.576 --> 17:25.142
And my crystal ball tells me

17:25.278 --> 17:27.712
That that mdma is connected to
randy's murder.

17:28.347 --> 17:29.547
(sam): Fine.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.916
Let's follow that courier and
see where he's taking the drugs.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.089
(rap music playing)

17:38.158 --> 17:39.557
(nelson): I saw your car
out front.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.292
(elliot): Ah, yeah,
it was a gift.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.561
I was gonna trade it in.
- Nice.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.628
I think it's genius.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.297
No one's ever gonna
pull you over in that thing.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.366
- Yeah, that's why I...
Kept it.

17:49.368 --> 17:50.535
Hey, uh...

17:51.571 --> 17:54.839
Randy's partner, tiggy,
needs to...

17:54.841 --> 17:56.039
You know, talk to you.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.475
- I don't know a tiggy.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.844
- Uh, yeah, she's cool.
She's, like... The brains.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.011
Randy's just the muscle.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.280
- So who has the connection
to buffalo?

18:03.316 --> 18:04.582
- That's tiggy.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.650
She wanted to fill you in
on a few things and...

18:06.686 --> 18:08.419
She told me to give you this.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.494
- Okay.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.831
Thank you.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.371
(dog barks in the distance)

18:34.047 --> 18:35.213
(soft knocking on door)

18:45.692 --> 18:46.858
- Wait. Where you going?

18:47.827 --> 18:49.193
Duff, where are you going?!

18:56.803 --> 18:59.670
- Hey. Were you just trying
to deliver those to my address?

18:59.805 --> 19:01.906
- 28? You... Finley silva?

19:01.975 --> 19:03.941
- Yeah, that's me.
Thank you.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.513
(kelly, muffled): Thank you
so much. Oh my god!

19:08.648 --> 19:10.147
Who are these from?

19:10.150 --> 19:12.116
Beautiful!

19:24.130 --> 19:26.931
(door opens)
(television playing)

19:29.135 --> 19:31.001
- Layna! Come on!

19:31.037 --> 19:32.637
Get up!
- No.

19:33.739 --> 19:34.538
- Come on.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.140
(television turns off)

19:36.142 --> 19:38.009
You're forgetting that randy was
a horrible human being.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.277
(slurred): Well, I was sleeping
with that horrible human being

19:40.413 --> 19:42.013
For a month, so...

19:42.015 --> 19:44.148
I might've gotten
a little attached.

19:44.283 --> 19:45.883
- Okay, well, he might've got
a little killed,

19:46.018 --> 19:47.417
And now I gotta fix it, okay?

19:47.453 --> 19:48.518
So pick up that snotty tissue

19:48.555 --> 19:50.087
And take the ugly snake
back to your room.

19:50.089 --> 19:50.821
(knocking)

19:50.957 --> 19:52.857
That's probably nelson.
Come on.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.294
Hi, you must be nelson.
Come on in.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.496
(television playing)

19:58.631 --> 20:00.097
- I gotta be somewhere
in a half-hour.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.866
- Okay. We'll make this quick.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.369
This is my sister.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.638
She's a little down because...
You know, randy...

20:07.773 --> 20:09.640
Fell off his perch,
as they say.

20:09.775 --> 20:11.842
But he brought me up to speed
on your business deal.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.444
I know he fronted you
50,000.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.179
<i> I</i> will be filling
randy's shoes.

20:15.181 --> 20:17.615
- I'm sorry.
I... Don't understand.

20:18.785 --> 20:19.816
- Oh...

20:20.453 --> 20:22.453
I thought you'd have heard.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.622
Randy's... Dead.

20:25.491 --> 20:26.457
It's very sad.

20:26.592 --> 20:27.625
But before that happened,

20:27.760 --> 20:29.593
He said that you would be
upping your volume

20:29.595 --> 20:32.396
And we will be bringing
your mdma across the border.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.399
See, randy made this deal
on my behalf.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.668
- Bill misiano gave me
the impression

20:37.803 --> 20:39.537
That he was running things.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.206
- How do you know about
bill misiano?

20:43.243 --> 20:44.275
- I didn't.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.209
Until he reached out to me.

20:47.213 --> 20:50.548
Said that he was randy's
primary investor and...

20:50.550 --> 20:52.016
And that the 50 grand
was his.

20:52.085 --> 20:52.950
- What?!

20:53.085 --> 20:54.284
(sighs)

20:54.320 --> 20:56.153
- Misiano wants to work
with me.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.021
Direct.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.890
And I checked him out.
He's legit. So...

20:59.926 --> 21:02.426
I'm not sure what you have
to offer me.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.828
I'm thinking the less people
involved, the better.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.197
(sighing)

21:09.569 --> 21:11.102
But my condolences.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.571
- Aw. Thanks.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.207
I appreciate it.

21:21.847 --> 21:22.713
(door closes)

21:23.750 --> 21:25.516
- What kind of person
leaves drugs on their doorstep

21:25.585 --> 21:26.550
For an hour?

21:27.920 --> 21:29.453
(woman speaking indistinctly)

21:29.455 --> 21:32.723
(kelly): My guess is
that kind of person.

21:36.395 --> 21:38.929
- Oh, girl, we are gonna...
Rave tonight!

21:38.931 --> 21:41.265
- Good thing no one stole
your merchandise.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.633
- Tonight is your lucky night.

21:42.768 --> 21:44.001
'cause you, my friend,
are getting

21:44.136 --> 21:45.870
A personal tour
of where we work.

22:11.597 --> 22:13.164
- Women are supposed
to stick together.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.232
- I don't think that blanket
statement always applies.

22:15.368 --> 22:16.633
- Well, this place is sexist.

22:16.669 --> 22:17.968
And I'm filing a lawsuit.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.104
- So you think we wouldn't have
arrested you for drugs

22:20.173 --> 22:21.405
If you were a man?

22:21.441 --> 22:23.707
- I think a man wouldn't have
spent a night in jail

22:23.743 --> 22:26.043
With nary a tampon to be found.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.979
- I don't think a man would be
able to find a tampon either.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.282
- There you go.

22:32.485 --> 22:33.550
- I was being metaphorical.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.219
- That's probably why
I didn't follow.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.555
- A man wouldn't need
a tampon, would he?

22:37.557 --> 22:39.523
- Gender is more complicated
than that, finley.

22:39.658 --> 22:41.057
You should know better,
you're a nurse.

22:41.094 --> 22:42.593
(kelly): I wonder what your
bosses will think

22:42.595 --> 22:45.262
When they find out you were
skipping work to attend a rave

22:45.398 --> 22:48.599
Wearing the worst outfit
in the history of the planet.

22:48.668 --> 22:49.934
And now you've got
a drug charge.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.069
- Okay. This is vintage.
(sam): Is it?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.937
- Yeah. And you're
blackmailing me.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.039
- We're not blackmailing you,
we're offering you a deal.

22:56.109 --> 22:58.442
- Okay. Demanding a benefit
in exchange for

22:58.444 --> 23:00.744
Not revealing compromising
information about me,

23:00.747 --> 23:02.579
That... Is blackmail.

23:02.648 --> 23:03.647
- God...

23:05.385 --> 23:06.617
Oh.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.285
Check it out.
It kinda is blackmail.

23:08.354 --> 23:10.687
(kelly): Oh. I don't feel good
about that.

23:10.689 --> 23:11.822
- I don't feel good about that.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.157
Maybe we should...

23:13.159 --> 23:14.758
Yeah.
- Just leave. Yeah.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.393
A criminal record is a bitch,

23:16.528 --> 23:18.496
But I'm sure your job
will be fine with it.

23:22.701 --> 23:23.601
- Wait!

23:24.537 --> 23:25.636
Where you going?

23:25.705 --> 23:27.838
- You don't want to tell us
who the drugs are from,

23:27.973 --> 23:29.173
We got better things to do.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.173
So, we're gonna do it.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.775
- 'kay. I don't know who
the drugs are from.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.711
But I can show you
how I get them.

23:34.881 --> 23:35.880
Phone!

23:39.185 --> 23:40.651
It's all done through an app.

23:40.653 --> 23:41.652
My friend told me about it.

23:41.721 --> 23:42.586
(beeping)

23:42.655 --> 23:43.988
You just order
the sunshine special,

23:44.123 --> 23:46.657
Capitalize the es,
like this,

23:46.726 --> 23:48.058
Pay through the app,

23:48.194 --> 23:49.993
Drugs show up at your house.
Just like that.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.462
(softly): Just like that.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.964
- Just like that.
- No, I hear what you're saying.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.165
- That was a good little
tag-team.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.667
- It was a good little tag-team,
but duff,

23:56.802 --> 23:58.335
I gotta be straight with you.
- What?

23:58.404 --> 24:00.404
- There is no way lorenzo day
doesn't know that his shop is

24:00.473 --> 24:02.138
Running drugs if people are
ordering them through his app.

24:02.175 --> 24:04.341
We should've grabbed him and
bodhi while we had the chance.

24:04.343 --> 24:06.076
- Apparently, you're dying
to say, "I told you so."

24:06.112 --> 24:07.011
So just say it.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.479
- I am not a gloater--
- hm.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.681
- And if I was a gloater,
I'd be gloating all the time,

24:10.683 --> 24:12.983
Because even though people
doubt me, I am usually right
about everything.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.218
- Oh my god.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.487
You're gloating about
not gloating.

24:17.023 --> 24:19.156
- Huh. That's weird.

24:19.759 --> 24:22.426
Looks like an outside site
has gained unauthorized access

24:22.561 --> 24:24.962
To gaia flowers' app.
- What does that mean?

24:25.031 --> 24:26.630
- Means the app's been
compromised.

24:26.632 --> 24:27.965
It's called
a blunt-force attack.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.234
Someone exploits a loophole
in the app's configuration

24:30.369 --> 24:32.002
So they can manipulate it
to do what they want.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.705
- So... Lorenzo could be
innocent.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.807
Hm. How interesting.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.909
- Okay, well...
Who's doing it, then?

24:38.978 --> 24:40.778
- That's what I'm going
to find out.

24:41.714 --> 24:42.980
(kelly): They deliver
for gaia.

24:43.115 --> 24:46.016
- Yeah, well, they also hacked
gaia's app using an onion site.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.518
(kelly): I'm sorry,
can you translate that for us?

24:47.520 --> 24:49.052
- It means it's fake.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.488
The top layer of the courier
site presents legit,

24:51.557 --> 24:53.491
But underneath, it's linked
to the dark web.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.561
When someone places an order
for a sunshine special

24:57.597 --> 24:59.129
Using the flower shop's app,

24:59.198 --> 25:00.397
It alerts the cortina website.

25:00.466 --> 25:01.532
- Okay, well, what about gaia?

25:01.667 --> 25:03.400
- Nah, it just looks like
a regular order to them.

25:03.469 --> 25:04.668
Except the es are capitalized.

25:04.803 --> 25:06.270
(kelly): Oh my gosh!
(sam): Yeah, to tip off bodhi

25:06.405 --> 25:07.538
That it's a drug order.

25:07.673 --> 25:08.539
We saw him put the drugs

25:08.608 --> 25:10.074
In the bouquet
that we took off finley.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.575
- Oh, so he's cortina's
inside man.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.176
Oh, someone just logged on.

25:13.246 --> 25:14.278
(kelly): Wait,
from the courier's?

25:14.347 --> 25:15.278
Well, shut it down,

25:15.314 --> 25:16.580
They'll know we're cops.
- I know.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.882
My ip's routed to look like
it's coming from copenhagen.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.750
They'll think I'm a hacker.
- No, no, don't engage. Don't!

25:20.786 --> 25:22.086
Stop. Don't engage.
Do-don't engage!

25:22.221 --> 25:24.655
- It's the only way to download
what they have on their server.

25:25.324 --> 25:26.290
(beeping)

25:26.292 --> 25:27.224
(chiming)

25:27.226 --> 25:28.091
Ah. They're hitting me
with malware.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.527
- Hit 'em back!
(goats bleating)

25:30.530 --> 25:31.895
- They're trying to intercept
the download.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.364
- Oh! Press "escape"! Escape!
- They're trying to kick me out.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.498
- Hit "escape" again!
- Okay.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.134
(kelly): What? They want
to play, I like to play.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.602
(exclamations)
(greene): Okay, okay, okay,

25:38.671 --> 25:40.204
Can you all stop pressing
"escape"? Please!

25:40.206 --> 25:41.338
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.073
(greene): Come on, almost there.
(kelly): You can do this.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.474
(greene): Oh, come on
don't do this to me!

25:44.544 --> 25:45.743
- Whoo!

25:45.878 --> 25:49.846
(chuckling): Now that, that is
a sport that I could watch.

25:49.848 --> 25:51.982
I mean, what a rush, huh?
Am I right or am I right?

25:52.018 --> 25:53.717
- It's not a sport, ding-dong.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.452
If it was, we just lost.

25:55.521 --> 25:56.720
- Not necessarily.

25:59.292 --> 26:00.657
- Did we get what we needed?

26:00.693 --> 26:02.125
- We sure did.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.427
- Boom!
(kelly, softly): Nice.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.495
- I want you to go through this
with a fine-tooth comb.

26:05.531 --> 26:07.230
Owner, employees, everything.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.600
I want everyone affiliated
with cortina couriers.

26:09.602 --> 26:10.601
- Yes. On it.

26:12.638 --> 26:14.338
Wait, wait, why does it feel
like we're just, like,

26:14.407 --> 26:15.405
Following orders?

26:15.474 --> 26:17.207
- 'cause he just did
his computer magic.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.143
And he's your boss.
- Yeah, but I...

26:19.278 --> 26:21.045
(whispering): It-it's
still annoying.

26:25.384 --> 26:26.683
- What are you going through?

26:26.719 --> 26:29.886
- I am going through cortina's
transaction history. You?

26:29.956 --> 26:31.688
- Uh, the employee list.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.223
- Well, that's gonna be easy.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.492
Bunch of delinquents
and degenerates.

26:35.561 --> 26:36.960
- Generalize much?

26:37.029 --> 26:39.029
- Reprobates, rapscallions,
hooligans, ne'er-do-wells,

26:39.031 --> 26:40.164
Layabouts, scallywags,

26:40.299 --> 26:41.699
All great words,
d'you notice that?

26:43.536 --> 26:44.435
- Sam...

26:44.570 --> 26:45.635
- I was joking.

26:45.671 --> 26:46.637
I'm having some fun.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.038
Remember, it's me,
it's cool, fun sam.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.039
- I don't care about that.

26:49.075 --> 26:50.741
Where did you say your son
got a job?

26:50.810 --> 26:53.210
- I don't know.
He didn't say. Why?

26:54.546 --> 26:55.579
- Because he's on this list.

26:55.714 --> 26:56.981
- That's a mistake.

26:57.850 --> 26:58.849
- I don't know.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.685
How many elliot wazowskis
are out there?

27:02.755 --> 27:05.289
- This is a mistake.
Uh... So...

27:06.525 --> 27:07.891
What are we gonna do?

27:09.061 --> 27:10.194
- No.

27:10.329 --> 27:11.395
You aren't gonna do anything.

27:12.197 --> 27:14.465
- Maybe we could just
take his name off the list.

27:16.369 --> 27:19.837
- Are you really asking me...
To do that?

27:21.974 --> 27:22.806
(softly): No.

27:25.378 --> 27:26.210
- Sam.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.547
- I have to...
- Wait. Wher-where you going?

27:30.549 --> 27:32.215
- I just have to have a minute.
- Sam.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.684
- I just need a minute, please.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.686
I... Will you tell shanks
for me?

27:35.755 --> 27:38.622
And just be the...
W... And because I-I...

27:38.757 --> 27:40.391
Can I...?
I have to have a minute.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.727
(soft music)

27:47.232 --> 27:48.499
- Mm!
(cellphone vibrating)

27:50.770 --> 27:52.569
- Yeah?
<i> (sam): Steve?</i>

27:52.571 --> 27:54.605
Steve, where did elliot
get his job?

27:55.141 --> 27:56.707
(muffled):
Some courier place, why?

27:56.776 --> 27:57.974
<i> (sam, mouth full):</i>
<i> I can't understand you.</i>

27:57.976 --> 27:59.642
What did you say?
What'd you say?

27:59.679 --> 28:00.711
<i>(steve, mouth full): I'm eating.</i>

28:00.846 --> 28:02.913
- Listen. Listen to me
right now.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.516
Elliot might be
dealing drugs.

28:05.651 --> 28:07.050
Okay?

28:07.053 --> 28:09.319
So I need you to roll up
your lawyer sleeves

28:09.455 --> 28:11.121
And actually defend someone.

28:11.590 --> 28:12.656
(muffled): What are you
talking about?

28:12.658 --> 28:14.324
- Oh my god, steve, please!

28:14.326 --> 28:15.459
(muffled): I can't
understand one word

28:15.594 --> 28:16.827
That you are saying
right now!

28:19.031 --> 28:21.331
- Hey, did you leave me
weird phone messages last night?

28:27.206 --> 28:29.039
- We need to bring in
wazowski's son.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.407
- Why?

28:30.409 --> 28:32.942
- We're chasing the mdma found
on randy bowen's body.

28:32.978 --> 28:35.345
It led us to...
A courier company,

28:35.347 --> 28:39.149
And elliot's name
is on the employee list.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.618
- M'kay. This... Is fine.

28:41.687 --> 28:42.752
This is gonna be fine.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.354
You keep her away from this.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.290
I'll send hamm out
to pick him up,

28:46.292 --> 28:47.791
Bring him down here.

28:49.095 --> 28:51.294
- I don't think this is
gonna be fine.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.731
- It's always fine.
Till it's not fine.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.734
(shanks): Hamm! Where are ya?

28:59.705 --> 29:02.506
(jackie sighs): You don't have
anything in the car, do you?

29:02.575 --> 29:03.840
- Nah. It should be fine.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.409
I think I know this guy.

29:07.513 --> 29:08.512
Hey, uh...

29:08.581 --> 29:09.646
Was I speeding or something?

29:09.782 --> 29:10.780
- No, no.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.450
God, this thing is
really small, huh?

29:13.585 --> 29:14.918
- Yeah...

29:14.987 --> 29:16.220
- Uh...

29:18.791 --> 29:20.691
You're gonna have
to exit the car, son.

29:29.468 --> 29:31.301
You don't have to do that.
Come on back.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.412
- Hey, I'll call you
in a bit, okay?

29:42.448 --> 29:43.547
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, go.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.048
I hope everything's okay.

29:45.818 --> 29:46.784
- Yeah...

30:05.538 --> 30:07.370
- Hey, sam.
- Hey.

30:08.007 --> 30:10.107
We found your name on the...

30:10.242 --> 30:12.943
Uh... Cortina courier
employee list.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.444
- Yeah, I told you I got a job.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.447
- How do you do it?

30:19.051 --> 30:21.317
How do you mess up
every little thing

30:21.353 --> 30:23.053
I have bent over
backwards on?

30:23.055 --> 30:24.254
I work my ass off.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.722
(door closes)
I have given you

30:25.724 --> 30:26.857
Every opportunity.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.325
You take it all for granted.
(shanks): Wazowski.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.392
Wazowski!
- What do you do?

30:29.428 --> 30:31.762
(shanks): Wazowski.
Get your ass back in oc!

30:31.897 --> 30:33.797
I'm gonna be taking him
in interview,

30:33.866 --> 30:34.998
And you are not going anywhere

30:35.000 --> 30:36.733
Until we find out exactly
how you're involved.

30:36.869 --> 30:37.801
(elliot): Involved with what?
- Go!

30:37.936 --> 30:39.536
(elliot): This is whack!
I need to make a call.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.204
- No, you don't. Give me that.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.406
Hamm, get her out of here.
And you, come with me.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.008
(softly): Come on, sam.
Please.

30:45.077 --> 30:46.876
(shanks): We're gonna have
a little talk.

30:46.912 --> 30:48.312
(door opens)

30:59.592 --> 31:02.426
<i> (woman): Businesses tend to</i>
<i> criticize their competitors.</i>

31:02.561 --> 31:05.161
<i> This is bad form.</i>

31:05.197 --> 31:08.498
<i> Instead, we should praise</i>
<i> our competitors.</i>

31:08.500 --> 31:10.700
<i> Learn from them.</i>
(jackie, muffled): Mom!

31:10.736 --> 31:12.836
<i> (woman): Cooperate with them</i>
<i> to their advantage.</i>

31:12.838 --> 31:14.104
(jackie): Mom!
<i> (woman): It will help you</i>

31:14.173 --> 31:15.772
<i> In the long run.</i>

31:15.808 --> 31:16.840
- Jesus, jackie!

31:16.909 --> 31:18.241
Give me a heart attack,
why don't you?

31:18.277 --> 31:20.110
- The cops just picked up
elliot.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.644
Okay? I don't know what
this is about.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.146
They said they needed
to talk to him.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.084
(exhaling)
(softly): This is about his job.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.253
I bet you anything
it's about his job

31:30.289 --> 31:31.388
With the cortina couriers.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.656
Bet the cops are onto them.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.725
- Okay. Whatever this is about,

31:34.860 --> 31:37.861
This is not good.
We cannot catch a break.

31:37.996 --> 31:38.995
- No, baby.

31:39.131 --> 31:41.164
This is our break.

31:41.166 --> 31:42.799
(shanks): You don't seem
to be the least bit worried.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.735
- Well, I don't really know
why I'm here.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.537
- Listen, you might
pull the wool

31:47.539 --> 31:48.672
Over your mother's eyes
on the regular,

31:48.807 --> 31:50.473
But you're not gonna
do that with me.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.608
We're gonna get real.
Right now.

31:52.645 --> 31:54.411
- Okay.
- Okay!

31:54.546 --> 31:56.480
Are you still going out
with that jackie sullivan?

31:56.615 --> 31:57.614
- Is this about her?

31:57.616 --> 31:59.549
'cause she... Has nothing to do
with this.

31:59.618 --> 32:00.817
Jackie's a good person.

32:00.853 --> 32:02.486
I mean... She's amazing,
actually.

32:02.621 --> 32:03.287
- Wazowski!

32:03.422 --> 32:04.755
<i> I know you're not watching.</i>

32:04.890 --> 32:06.823
<i> I know you're not in there,</i>
<i> watching.</i>

32:06.859 --> 32:10.226
<i> Because I distinctly told you</i>
<i> to stay away from this.</i>

32:10.262 --> 32:11.494
- Told you.

32:11.530 --> 32:13.764
<i> (shanks): What's your job--</i>
- come on. Let's go.

32:13.899 --> 32:15.499
- I can't.
(kelly sighs)

32:16.435 --> 32:17.834
- What's the worst
that can happen?

32:17.836 --> 32:19.903
- He can be involved.
- Okay.

32:20.038 --> 32:22.339
(shanks, indistinctly)

32:22.408 --> 32:23.840
So, say that he is.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.576
Does it mean that
you can't love him anymore?

32:27.346 --> 32:29.913
Does it mean that you're
a bad mom?

32:31.383 --> 32:32.716
No.

32:34.019 --> 32:37.587
We can love people who...
Do bad things.

32:37.589 --> 32:40.624
We just...
Can't save them, sam.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.194
Come on, let's go.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.932
(naz): Hey, uh, I found
something on gaia flowers.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.867
It's a... Bill of lading.

32:50.869 --> 32:53.737
A shipment of flowers is slated
to go to buffalo today.

32:53.739 --> 32:55.271
The truck'll be stateside
by sundown.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.475
Question is, are they delivering
drugs hidden in flowers,

32:58.544 --> 32:59.743
Or are they just
delivering flowers?

32:59.812 --> 33:01.545
- Look, bodhi malvo took
the shipment order,

33:01.547 --> 33:03.347
So my guess is they're exporting
across the border.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.414
- Uh-huh.

33:04.450 --> 33:05.615
- Randy bowen was probably
the connect.

33:05.617 --> 33:06.482
- Yep.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.151
- So, should we call it in
to fbs?

33:08.187 --> 33:09.619
- No, I want to catch the driver

33:09.655 --> 33:10.754
Before he leaves
the flower shop.

33:10.823 --> 33:12.321
- Okay. Let's get these guys.

33:12.358 --> 33:14.023
- Yep.
- I'm gonna go with duff.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.360
- Wazowski, look, I don't think
you should go.

33:17.429 --> 33:18.328
- Please.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.164
Duff, please, I can't stay here.

33:21.233 --> 33:24.001
Hey, look, it's me,
operating in the grey zone.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.003
I'll follow your lead.

33:26.739 --> 33:27.571
I promise.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.741
I promise.
(kelly): Okay.

33:32.310 --> 33:33.676
My lead.
(sam): Yes.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.278
<i> (shanks): ...Blind eye</i>
<i> to anything.</i>

33:35.280 --> 33:36.245
<i> (elliot): Nope.</i>

33:36.281 --> 33:37.581
<i> (shanks): Sit up straight,</i>
<i> for god's sakes.</i>

33:37.716 --> 33:39.116
<i> This is serious.</i>

33:44.456 --> 33:46.823
(knocking)
(door opens)

33:47.860 --> 33:48.591
(nelson): Tiggy?

33:48.660 --> 33:50.460
Wh-what are you doing here?

33:50.996 --> 33:51.928
What do you want?

33:51.964 --> 33:54.664
- It's more about
what you want right now.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.000
Or should I say... Need.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.870
Bet you think you're clever,
side-stepping me,

34:00.005 --> 34:01.605
Making a direct deal
with buffalo.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.074
But I happen to know...

34:04.209 --> 34:05.642
The police are onto you.

34:06.678 --> 34:07.878
Your business is busted.

34:08.013 --> 34:10.447
- It was probably the cops
hacking the system this morning.

34:10.449 --> 34:11.815
(nelson, grunts): Goddammit!

34:11.817 --> 34:14.551
- Buffalo's expecting
a shipment, right?

34:15.487 --> 34:18.154
So when that doesn't show up,
misiano's not going to be happy.

34:18.190 --> 34:21.157
Have you seen misiano not happy?

34:21.193 --> 34:22.392
It's not pretty.

34:23.495 --> 34:26.296
But now, your business
is on the cops' radar.

34:26.365 --> 34:30.400
One wrong move, and you all
go down in flames.

34:32.504 --> 34:35.238
You make excellent product.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.240
And I admire that. I do.

34:38.376 --> 34:39.509
And in turn,

34:39.511 --> 34:42.779
I hope you'll respect what
I bring to the table.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.046
Importing,

34:44.083 --> 34:45.315
Exporting,

34:45.450 --> 34:46.516
And information.

34:48.186 --> 34:50.186
In the spirit of collaboration,

34:50.322 --> 34:52.788
I'm willing to save your ass.
Of course...

34:52.825 --> 34:55.992
I'm gonna have to renegotiate
my cut. But...

34:56.061 --> 34:58.662
Those are just details.
Right?

35:00.332 --> 35:03.967
(soft, funky music)

35:12.144 --> 35:13.009
- Hey!

35:13.145 --> 35:14.411
(kelly): Gtpd!

35:14.847 --> 35:16.479
We have a warrant to search
your van.

35:16.482 --> 35:17.514
- What's going on?

35:18.216 --> 35:19.449
What's going on?!

35:23.055 --> 35:25.222
Hey, careful with that!
(kelly sighs)

35:26.091 --> 35:27.157
- You got anything?

35:27.159 --> 35:29.759
- Not yet. Anything up there?
- Nothing.

35:34.066 --> 35:35.832
- Who's gonna pay for this?

35:37.236 --> 35:38.435
(banging on door)

35:38.570 --> 35:40.370
- Bodhi malvo, open up.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.706
- Gtpd. We've got a warrant
for your arrest.

35:46.111 --> 35:47.110
(kelly): There's nothing here.

35:47.179 --> 35:48.378
(sam): This doesn't make
any sense.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.647
Where are the drugs?

35:50.649 --> 35:51.948
(sam): Argh!
- No!

35:53.051 --> 35:54.184
- Great. Hm.

35:56.254 --> 35:57.387
- Must be hiding.

35:58.056 --> 36:00.257
My favourite place to hide
is the dryer.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.258
(cellphone ringing)

36:01.260 --> 36:02.759
- Or somebody tipped him off.

36:04.096 --> 36:04.861
<i> (sam): Naz?</i>

36:04.996 --> 36:05.929
- Yeah. Somebody tipped
him off.

36:05.998 --> 36:07.697
<i> - Yeah. I bet I know who.</i>

36:09.467 --> 36:10.534
- Hey, don't go there.

36:10.669 --> 36:11.601
It wasn't elliot, right?

36:11.736 --> 36:12.735
He's been with shanks all day.

36:12.804 --> 36:15.038
And didn't you tell me
shanks took his phone?

36:18.277 --> 36:19.176
It's okay.

36:19.811 --> 36:20.810
Come on.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.080
(city soundscape)

36:29.922 --> 36:31.621
(man): But I wiped it
down clean.

36:31.756 --> 36:34.624
If any mud gets on 'em,
I take 'em off right away.

36:34.660 --> 36:35.758
Because, you know,

36:35.794 --> 36:37.493
There's nothing like clean
running shoes, right?

36:37.529 --> 36:39.428
Ladybug, is that you?

36:39.464 --> 36:41.030
Welcome to buffalo.

36:41.066 --> 36:42.431
- Yeah, it's me!

36:42.467 --> 36:45.635
Disappointed it's not your
new best friend, nelson lam?

36:45.637 --> 36:47.637
- What, are you kidding me?
I'm always rooting for you!

36:47.673 --> 36:48.905
- You should be
thanking me.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.774
If it wasn't for your little
"ladybug,"

36:50.909 --> 36:52.242
Nelson would be in cuffs.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.977
The cops are onto his route.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.512
Push came to shove,

36:55.647 --> 36:57.514
Nelson would've turned you in.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.449
- Boys, see that? You see?
Are you listening to this?

36:59.518 --> 37:01.484
This is what I'm talking about.
This, right here.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.453
They're so sick and tired of me
going on about

37:03.588 --> 37:04.721
"women this, women that."

37:04.723 --> 37:06.189
None of them voted for hillary.

37:06.324 --> 37:07.657
How'd that work out for you?

37:07.693 --> 37:09.326
- I don't give a damn
who they voted for.

37:09.461 --> 37:12.862
I care that you tried
to double-cross me.

37:12.998 --> 37:16.299
I don't want to work with men
I can't trust.

37:20.239 --> 37:22.805
- Well... Tiggy...

37:22.841 --> 37:24.241
I'm a snake.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.810
It's a fact.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.711
Everybody knows that
about me.

37:29.248 --> 37:31.013
I will take your ear off,

37:31.049 --> 37:32.549
I will take your neck off,

37:32.684 --> 37:35.285
Unless you do things for me.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.619
So, the question is,

37:36.655 --> 37:38.888
Are you gonna be
my feast,

37:38.957 --> 37:41.291
Or are you gonna be
my nest?

37:41.426 --> 37:43.159
Nelson would've
screwed the pooch

37:43.295 --> 37:44.694
If it wasn't for you,

37:44.730 --> 37:47.330
So now, he's my... Feast.

37:47.332 --> 37:51.968
You saved the day, so now,
you're... Gonna be my nest.

37:54.506 --> 37:55.505
(softly): That's it.

37:56.474 --> 37:57.807
It's that simple.

37:58.744 --> 38:01.144
Come on.
Let's go have some fun.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.383
Let's have a good time.
You-you deserve it. Come on.

38:06.518 --> 38:07.384
Come on.

38:15.961 --> 38:16.859
- I needed that.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.328
- You know,
as far as burritos go,

38:18.330 --> 38:19.062
It's, like, it's not bad.

38:19.197 --> 38:20.430
You know?
- Mm.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.668
Your child was hungry.
- Uh-huh.

38:29.241 --> 38:31.608
- I drilled him for hours,
he never cracked.

38:31.610 --> 38:32.675
- What are you thinking?

38:32.744 --> 38:34.076
- I'm thinking
that if he's lying,

38:34.112 --> 38:36.579
He's pretty damn good at it.
- I already know that.

38:37.749 --> 38:40.617
(sighing): Let's just...
Keep an eye on him, okay?

38:40.752 --> 38:41.651
- Okay.

38:43.388 --> 38:44.420
- Eat all of it.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.690
I spent money on that.
(elliot): Yes, ma'am.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.359
(door buzzing)

38:53.632 --> 38:56.099
(cellphone vibrating)
oh, I think that's dad.

38:56.168 --> 38:58.134
He's probably outside. I'll...

38:59.170 --> 39:00.670
Yeah.
- Elliot.

39:03.875 --> 39:06.376
If you have gotten yourself
into something

39:06.378 --> 39:07.944
That you can't get out of,

39:08.914 --> 39:10.413
I can get you out.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.051
(cellphone buzzing)

39:21.626 --> 39:22.692
- I love you, mom.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.095
Okay? I really do.

39:26.798 --> 39:27.997
I'll see you soon.

39:28.133 --> 39:29.399
- Yeah...

39:37.742 --> 39:38.575
(door closes)

39:41.980 --> 39:45.214
- Third cousin on your
grandfather's side.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.850
I have to admit,

39:46.852 --> 39:49.619
Your commitment to grief
was exceptional.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.620
- I'm detective kelly duff.

39:51.656 --> 39:53.289
- Hello, kelly.

39:53.358 --> 39:55.291
- We're investigating
a courier company

39:55.327 --> 39:57.827
That we suspect is trafficking
illegal narcotics

39:57.829 --> 40:00.163
Using your floral arrangements.

40:00.165 --> 40:01.297
- What?

40:04.202 --> 40:05.969
I'm sorry. Am I in some sort
of trouble?

40:06.104 --> 40:08.304
Do I need a lawyer here?
- No. But...

40:08.306 --> 40:09.972
We need to know
everything you know

40:10.008 --> 40:12.775
About the courier that picked up
your latest shipment to buffalo.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.777
- Of course. I'll tell you
everything.

40:14.846 --> 40:16.846
But I was only there
for the second pick-up.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.715
- There were two pick-ups?
- Yes!

40:19.751 --> 40:21.116
Cortina, they called
last minute,

40:21.153 --> 40:22.318
They made special arrangements
to have

40:22.454 --> 40:25.522
The first half of the shipment
picked up an hour earlier.

40:26.425 --> 40:27.457
Look, you see?

40:27.459 --> 40:28.991
My employee, bodhi malvo.

40:29.594 --> 40:30.627
He took care of everything.

40:32.730 --> 40:33.730
- Bodhi...

40:35.167 --> 40:36.131
Give me one second.

40:36.168 --> 40:37.734
Can I borrow this?
- Uh, of course. Yes.

40:37.869 --> 40:38.668
Uh, just...
- Be right back.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.103
- Uh, okay. Uh...

40:41.907 --> 40:43.673
Don't check the messages.

40:44.375 --> 40:45.341
(greene): Did you?

40:45.410 --> 40:47.210
(gabrielle): Do what?
(greene): Did you go?

40:47.212 --> 40:49.011
Mm. On occasion.

40:49.481 --> 40:52.081
- Okay, well,
I better get going.

40:56.754 --> 40:57.954
- So...

40:58.089 --> 40:59.756
That's your new Friday night?

41:00.559 --> 41:01.824
- She could be.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.260
She's not limiting things
to one night a week.

41:06.364 --> 41:08.131
So I snore in my sleep?

41:09.067 --> 41:10.366
You've been listening.

41:10.402 --> 41:11.834
- Oh, I listen.

41:11.837 --> 41:15.170
There's just an awful lot
you haven't been saying.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.406
I didn't know about
your promotion.

41:17.476 --> 41:20.376
You didn't tell me
about your new Friday night.

41:22.948 --> 41:24.848
Anything else
you want to share?

41:27.052 --> 41:29.285
- Honestly,
I didn't know you cared.

41:33.124 --> 41:34.357
- Nice flowers.

41:41.366 --> 41:42.598
Sorry for your loss.

41:42.634 --> 41:44.701
(soft music)

41:46.738 --> 41:48.505
- Yeah. So am I.

41:53.077 --> 41:54.744
(sighing)

42:31.049 --> 42:32.048
(exhaling loudly)

42:32.117 --> 42:33.149
(sam): Do you see something?

42:34.853 --> 42:36.653
- Y... I-I'm looking for the
other half of that shipment

42:36.788 --> 42:38.588
Lorenzo was talking about.
- Uh-huh.

42:38.590 --> 42:39.788
- Cortina's.

42:39.824 --> 42:41.523
They didn't cross the border,
but look...

42:41.560 --> 42:42.792
There was another shipment
of flowers

42:42.927 --> 42:44.927
That went to buffalo
tonight.

42:44.930 --> 42:46.862
- It was another courier truck?
- Nope.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.865
Sullivan logistics.

42:49.935 --> 42:51.601
Tiggy sullivan's company,

42:51.603 --> 42:52.935
Mother of jackie sullivan,

42:53.004 --> 42:54.604
Our key informant
on the stockwood case,

42:54.673 --> 42:56.072
And your son's girlfriend.

42:56.141 --> 42:58.340
I knew something was up
with that girl.

42:58.376 --> 43:00.275
I knew it. I knew it!
- No, no, no, no.

43:00.312 --> 43:02.278
'cause... We looked into tiggy.

43:02.413 --> 43:03.613
She was clean.
She was spotless.

43:03.682 --> 43:04.881
- Now, she's about to be
the stain

43:05.016 --> 43:06.949
On both of our
reputations.

43:06.985 --> 43:11.521
(sighing): Tiggy sullivan.
- Tiggy sullivan.
