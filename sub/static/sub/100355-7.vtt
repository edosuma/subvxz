00:01.523 --> 00:04.700
- Not even the six
can stop me now.

00:04.743 --> 00:08.660
- Beebo want cuddles!

00:11.315 --> 00:13.317
- Guys, guys!

00:13.361 --> 00:14.710
- Dad.

00:14.753 --> 00:17.060
- I'm sorry, Nora.
He died a good man.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.149
- He died a demon, Ray.

00:19.193 --> 00:23.414
- ♪ Oh, I've been cleaning up
some Beebo ♪

00:23.458 --> 00:27.070
♪ Just to scrub
the time anomalies away ♪

00:27.114 --> 00:31.422
♪ Hey, can't you see
the blue fluff blowing ♪

00:31.466 --> 00:33.337
Hello?

00:33.381 --> 00:35.165
Who's there?

00:35.209 --> 00:37.080
Okay, just gonna use my hand
to block out the sun's glare

00:37.124 --> 00:40.518
so I can see you.

00:40.562 --> 00:43.086
You.
No!

00:43.130 --> 00:44.696
No, it can't be you!

00:59.407 --> 01:01.191
- The Loom of Fate,

01:01.235 --> 01:02.540
an ancient artifact
that has the power

01:02.584 --> 01:04.368
to change any person's
life story

01:04.412 --> 01:05.978
without wrecking the timeline.

01:06.022 --> 01:08.764
Anyone's, like--
- Astra's.

01:08.807 --> 01:11.114
We give her a life
where her mom never died

01:11.158 --> 01:13.203
and where she never goes
to hell.

01:13.247 --> 01:14.335
- Well, if you think
I'm helping you,

01:14.378 --> 01:15.901
you're daft as a bush.

01:15.945 --> 01:17.164
I destroyed that thing

01:17.207 --> 01:18.295
for a bloody good reason,
John-o.

01:18.339 --> 01:19.949
- Come on, Sara.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.690
You know this can solve
all of our problems.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.170
It can erase
all of the Encores.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.259
- Yeah, and make all
of our dreams come true.

01:25.302 --> 01:26.608
John, I'm sorry,

01:26.651 --> 01:28.349
but I'm with Charlie
on this one.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.133
That kind of cosmic power
doesn't belong

01:30.177 --> 01:31.395
in the hands of anyone.

01:31.439 --> 01:33.136
Astra has made her choices,
John.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.138
It is not up to you
to undo them.

01:35.182 --> 01:39.969
Now, this will be the solution
to our Encore problem.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.406
- Captain Lance,
there is a new Encore detected

01:42.450 --> 01:46.280
in Salvation, 1874.
- I love my Prognosticator.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.325
- All right, Legends,

01:48.369 --> 01:51.285
grab your cowboy hats
and leather straps

01:51.328 --> 01:54.201
because we are going to--

01:54.244 --> 01:56.290
Where is everyone?

01:56.333 --> 01:58.161
- Yeah, I might have got
a bit sentimental

01:58.205 --> 02:00.250
on my deathbed
and encouraged Raymond

02:00.294 --> 02:03.384
to carpe his diem.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.081
- Nice rock.
- Yeah.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.214
- She'll love that.

02:07.257 --> 02:10.173
- And when she finds it,

02:10.217 --> 02:11.348
I'll pop the question.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.180
- She's here.
She's really here.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.530
- Oh, man.

02:19.574 --> 02:21.228
It's really happening.

02:21.271 --> 02:24.013
- Our work here is done.

02:24.056 --> 02:25.536
Our boy's all growns up.

02:38.288 --> 02:41.378
- Nora Darhk.
Welcome.

02:41.422 --> 02:44.381
I will have the pleasure
of serving you this evening.

02:44.425 --> 02:47.210
- Thanks, Gare.

02:47.254 --> 02:51.432
Whoa, wow, Ray.

02:51.475 --> 02:54.435
You really went all out
for date night.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.046
- I thought we were
just having pizza.

02:57.089 --> 02:59.483
- Oh, I got a little inspired,
I guess.

02:59.527 --> 03:00.615
- Yeah.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.360
- I see Pippa
is still your charge.

03:06.403 --> 03:09.232
- Yes, until we figure out
her heart's deepest need.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.671
- Oh, big talker, I see.

03:17.327 --> 03:18.894
- Defiling the library, I see.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.461
- Yeah, well, uh, you know,
I've quit smoking,

03:20.504 --> 03:22.158
so, uh,
I need a new habit.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.639
- Doing some research?
- Yeah, yeah.

03:24.682 --> 03:26.423
I need to find the Loom of Fate
to save Astra,

03:26.467 --> 03:29.644
but since, uh, Charlie
isn't making it easy for me,

03:29.687 --> 03:32.342
I am doing it the hard way.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.431
- Why not ask a historian?

03:34.475 --> 03:36.128
All right, then,
Mr. Professor.

03:36.172 --> 03:37.347
Tell me,
what do you know?

03:37.391 --> 03:39.523
- Well,
when I was in grad school,

03:39.567 --> 03:42.091
my professor showed me a diary

03:42.134 --> 03:44.485
of an explorer
named Ernest Shackleton.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.617
Now, Shackleton was obsessed
with the Loom,

03:46.661 --> 03:48.140
and he believed a piece of it

03:48.184 --> 03:50.665
was buried under
the South Pole.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.362
- So if I'm to find the Loom,

03:52.406 --> 03:54.843
I've gotta search
the South Pole?

03:54.886 --> 03:58.194
- Shackleton thought so.
- Wow, bloody hell.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.630
Nice one, Nate.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.763
- Don't worry, John.

04:01.806 --> 04:05.419
We'll figure out another way
to help you and Astra.

04:07.159 --> 04:09.292
That ought to cool his jets.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.471
- Hey, Mick!
Saddle up!

04:14.515 --> 04:16.778
We're going to the wild West.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.303
- Is everything okay in there?

04:22.479 --> 04:24.089
- He's been in there for days.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.308
- What are you
still doing here?

04:25.352 --> 04:27.702
- Exfoliating.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.443
- Mick, get out here right now!

04:31.532 --> 04:33.490
- What?
- What is going on?

04:33.534 --> 04:35.536
- Someone's trashing
Rebecca Silver online.

04:35.579 --> 04:36.711
- Oh, cute.
You have a troll.

04:36.754 --> 04:39.235
- What's wrong with your face?

04:40.758 --> 04:42.586
- Zari, your mission
is to help Mick.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.501
- Okay, I have so many
makeover ideas.

04:44.545 --> 04:46.329
- With his troll problem.

04:49.027 --> 04:50.507
Hmm.

04:54.424 --> 04:57.122
Did I just fritz
out of existence?

04:58.820 --> 05:02.345
Oh!
The train's coming!

05:02.389 --> 05:04.434
Help me!
Oh, ooh, yes!

05:04.478 --> 05:06.131
H-help me!
Untie me!

05:06.175 --> 05:07.524
I'm too beautiful
to die so young!

05:07.568 --> 05:10.397
- Train's coming!

05:12.224 --> 05:15.358
- Stand up, stand up, stand up!
- Oh, no!

05:15.402 --> 05:17.142
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

05:17.186 --> 05:19.014
The train!
Oh, God!

05:19.057 --> 05:21.538
Director Sharpe!
You saved me!

05:21.582 --> 05:23.627
- Okay.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.586
Wait, wait, wait a second.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.022
Did you just say
"Director Sharpe"?

05:27.065 --> 05:30.721
- Yeah.
- Gary, what year are you from?

05:30.765 --> 05:32.984
- The present, 2018.
- Okay, listen.

05:33.028 --> 05:34.421
I need you to tell us
who did this

05:34.464 --> 05:36.205
and then immediately Courier
back to the Bureau.

05:36.248 --> 05:39.991
- I can't.
He stole my Time Courier.

05:40.035 --> 05:42.080
- Who?

05:51.568 --> 05:54.223
- Hi, Nora doll.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.529
Daddy's home.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.271
Dad?

06:04.102 --> 06:09.194
- Oh, Nora doll!
I missed you so much.

06:09.238 --> 06:12.023
- This is amazing.
How are you?

06:12.067 --> 06:14.417
You are an Encore.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.027
- Look, all I know is,
I'm up here right now

06:16.071 --> 06:19.117
as part of some
soul-harvesting pyramid scheme.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.250
Honestly, I can't keep up
with these millennials

06:21.293 --> 06:24.035
and all their newfangled
world domination plans.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.429
- So you're doing
the whole villain thing again?

06:26.473 --> 06:27.909
- Well, you know--
no, I mean,

06:27.952 --> 06:30.520
it's part
of my parole agreement.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.479
But after spending
two years in hell

06:32.522 --> 06:34.045
worrying about my little girl,

06:34.089 --> 06:36.613
I had to come
and see you first.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.615
But look at this place!

06:38.659 --> 06:41.618
You must be
a master sorceress by now.

06:41.662 --> 06:42.837
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.056
This is just a place
where I hang my hat

06:45.100 --> 06:46.884
and do my dark rituals.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.626
- Dark rituals!
- Um, how did you find me?

06:49.670 --> 06:50.845
Blood magic?

06:50.888 --> 06:52.499
- Your PalmerTech watch,

06:52.542 --> 06:54.892
it still has
location sharing on.

06:54.936 --> 06:57.242
- PalmerTech.
Right.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.462
Ray!
- Oh, sorry for the delay.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.899
Gary seems to have run off.
- My dad's here.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.684
- What?
- My dad's here!

07:03.727 --> 07:05.120
- Your dad's here?
- Shh!

07:05.163 --> 07:08.689
- Oh, oh, man!
Is he an Encore? Oh, man!

07:08.732 --> 07:10.691
And Sara just found herself
a Hell Sword, which means--

07:10.734 --> 07:12.693
- She'll kill him.
- What do we do? What do we do?

07:12.736 --> 07:14.172
- You have to leave.
- What about Pippa?

07:14.216 --> 07:15.565
- Pippa. Pippa!
- Pippa. Pippa!

07:15.609 --> 07:16.566
- You have to take her.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.307
You have to--ooh--

07:18.350 --> 07:20.962
keep her comfortable
so that she doesn't summon me.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.180
That's it!
That's gonna work!

07:22.224 --> 07:24.879
Thanks, Ray.
- Okay.

07:24.922 --> 07:27.272
- "Rebecca Silver
knows as much about love

07:27.316 --> 07:29.579
as a teenage boy's
sock drawer."

07:33.365 --> 07:36.760
Okay, bad reviews,
they just come with celebrity.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.588
You should have heard what
they said about my perfume

07:38.632 --> 07:40.634
when it made people bleed
out their noses.

07:40.677 --> 07:43.550
-  He's gonna get more
than a bloody nose.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.987
- No, don't stoop to his level.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.685
Inside every troll
is the heart of a fan

07:48.729 --> 07:51.775
just dying for some attention.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.212
And some swag.

07:54.256 --> 07:58.782
One signed book and he'll be
a Rebecca Silver stan forever.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.610
- ♪ Ta-da

08:00.654 --> 08:02.438
- What's that?

08:02.482 --> 08:06.311
- Oh, this is a TV show I used
to watch when I was a kid.

08:06.355 --> 08:07.530
Really helped me dig deep

08:07.574 --> 08:09.924
and communicate
my feelings better.

08:09.967 --> 08:12.535
It's called
"Mister Parker's Cul de Sac,"

08:12.579 --> 08:14.145
and I think you're
really gonna like it.

08:40.607 --> 08:43.479
- Oh, well,
just give it a chance, okay?

08:43.523 --> 08:46.743
- Today we're going to have
ourselves a wonderful...

08:46.787 --> 08:48.571
- And...

08:48.615 --> 08:51.139
How about 20 bucks?
- We get to spend together.

08:51.182 --> 08:52.619
- I'll be right back.

08:52.662 --> 08:54.577
- Have you ever imagined
what it'd be like

08:54.621 --> 08:55.752
to live underwater?

08:58.102 --> 09:00.409
- Ah!

09:00.452 --> 09:01.976
- So?
Bachelor party?

09:02.019 --> 09:03.673
- No.

09:03.717 --> 09:06.154
Nora's dad literally came back
from the dead

09:06.197 --> 09:10.245
and ruined the evening.
- Damien Darhk? Ooh.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.638
- Anyway, Nora said
she can handle it

09:11.681 --> 09:12.769
and so she's handling it,

09:12.813 --> 09:14.205
but we can't
let anyone interfere,

09:14.249 --> 09:15.772
especially not Sara.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.992
- I mean, he is your
future father-in-law.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.689
You don't think
we could talk Sara down?

09:19.733 --> 09:21.038
- If I see Damien Darhk,

09:21.082 --> 09:22.649
I'm gonna kill him
for good this time.

09:22.692 --> 09:23.824
- What about Nora?

09:23.867 --> 09:25.782
- Well, ideally
she never finds out.

09:25.826 --> 09:28.045
Gideon, any hits?
- Yes, Captain.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.047
In fact, I'm detecting
new Encore activity

09:30.091 --> 09:32.267
at Constantine's home in 2020.

09:32.310 --> 09:33.790
- All right,
let's do this discreetly.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.444
Just us,
no boys.

09:35.487 --> 09:36.750
You know how sentimental
they can get.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.795
- Yep.
- You also received a call

09:38.839 --> 09:40.623
from a wild dog
while you were away.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.190
- Yep, got it.
Thanks, Gideon.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.670
- What was that all about?

09:43.713 --> 09:46.673
- Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

09:46.716 --> 09:49.066
- This is extremely
pornographic.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.807
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:53.114 --> 09:57.335
Ooh, troll made a post.
Must have gotten his swag bag.

09:57.379 --> 09:58.641
Oh, look.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.817
He's showing off
your signature.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.863
This is perfect.

10:07.389 --> 10:09.434
What the--

10:09.478 --> 10:11.828
Oh!

10:11.872 --> 10:15.571
Oh, that little punk!

10:15.615 --> 10:17.660
Okay, change of tactic.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.488
- What are you doing?

10:19.531 --> 10:21.316
- Scouring the metadata
from his post

10:21.359 --> 10:23.840
to composite his location.
- You hack?

10:23.884 --> 10:24.841
- No.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.547
- It's a girl.
- It's okay. Just go.

10:35.591 --> 10:36.723
- Do you know who I am?
- Yeah.

10:36.766 --> 10:39.160
What are you doing here, Becky?

10:39.203 --> 10:40.901
- I'm Rebecca Silver,

10:40.944 --> 10:43.164
and you will listen to me,
you pimple-faced--

10:43.207 --> 10:45.253
But she doesn't have pimples.
- Just go with it.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.907
Keep going.
- I'm a celebrated author.

10:46.950 --> 10:50.171
My latest novel was a triumph,
and you know it.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.739
Uh, wh-what the hell
have you done with your life,

10:52.782 --> 10:54.044
and who are you
to judge others?

10:54.088 --> 10:57.308
- Mick?
- Ali!

10:57.352 --> 11:00.703
- Mick, wh-why are you here?
- Why are you here?

11:00.747 --> 11:02.879
- I live here.

11:02.923 --> 11:05.360
Why is she filming us?

11:05.403 --> 11:06.927
- This your kid?

11:08.929 --> 11:09.886
- Well, I guess
since you're here,

11:09.930 --> 11:12.280
I might as well tell you.

11:12.323 --> 11:14.935
She's your kid too.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.763
This is Lita,
your daughter.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.380
- Twist!

11:25.423 --> 11:26.686
Oh, he's fine.

11:29.601 --> 11:30.733
- Mm.

11:30.777 --> 11:33.431
- Well, that was
my wizard's tower.

11:33.475 --> 11:34.911
- I love it.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.913
You can just smell
the dark forces

11:36.957 --> 11:37.958
at work in here.
- Mm.

11:38.001 --> 11:41.439
Ah. Ooh!

11:41.483 --> 11:43.093
Safe neighborhood?
- Super safe.

11:43.137 --> 11:44.791
People just mostly keep
to themselves.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.227
- Good.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.750
You know what the worst kind
of neighbors are?

11:47.794 --> 11:48.751
- Hmm?
- Kids.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.448
- Ooh, I hate kids.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.146
- You know, all I've ever
asked for are neighbors

11:52.189 --> 11:54.017
I don't have to kill.
- Mm.

11:54.061 --> 11:56.672
- But for people like us,

11:56.716 --> 12:01.155
sometimes it's kill
or be killed.

12:01.198 --> 12:02.678
- You know what?
- Hmm?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.462
- Better safe than sorry.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.551
Right, Dad?

12:06.595 --> 12:08.684
- Attagirl.
- Did she see us?

12:08.728 --> 12:09.816
- I don't know.

12:12.906 --> 12:15.038
- What was that?

12:15.082 --> 12:16.474
- You know what?

12:16.518 --> 12:18.781
I have a surprise
for you in the study.

12:18.825 --> 12:21.871
- Oh, well, hey.
I love surprises!

12:25.527 --> 12:27.007
- Yes, I saw you!

12:27.050 --> 12:29.966
Listen, I know you're here
to kill my dad,

12:30.010 --> 12:32.273
and I know you have
good reason,

12:32.316 --> 12:35.145
but I'm asking you
as my friends

12:35.189 --> 12:39.280
just to give me this one night
to handle it my way.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.804
- And what exactly is your way?

12:44.546 --> 12:50.421
- Dad, may I present
my...henchmen?

12:50.465 --> 12:53.294
Women.
Just people.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.817
Henchpeople.
- Wait a minute.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.253
Are you saying the head
of the Time Bureau

12:56.297 --> 12:57.820
and the captain
of the Waverider

12:57.864 --> 12:59.430
work for you now?

12:59.474 --> 13:01.868
- Well, I can be
very convincing.

13:04.435 --> 13:07.047
- Ooh.

13:09.353 --> 13:12.617
That is a heck of a find.

13:12.661 --> 13:15.185
Mm-hmm.

13:15.229 --> 13:18.667
11th-century Mongolia,
if I'm not mistaken.

13:18.710 --> 13:21.975
- Oh, yeah,
that's just a little something

13:22.018 --> 13:24.412
they picked up for me.
Thanks.

13:24.455 --> 13:27.284
It's not for indoor use,
though, so I'm just gonna...

13:27.328 --> 13:29.896
- Safety first, Nora doll.

13:34.596 --> 13:37.033
- Thanks, you guys,
for playing along.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.513
- Ticktock, ladies.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.907
I could really use
that cocktail about now.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.865
- Remind me again why
I shouldn't go in there

13:42.909 --> 13:45.085
right now and stab him
with Khan's sword.

13:45.128 --> 13:46.521
- He's my dad.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.088
- He's also one of the most
powerful dark warlocks

13:48.131 --> 13:50.481
on the planet, so...
- Wait.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.092
What if he was just a man?

13:52.135 --> 13:53.702
- Hmm?
- What?

13:53.745 --> 13:55.095
- There's a potion that can
strip him of his powers.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.574
It's complicated to make,

13:56.618 --> 13:58.359
but there are ingredients here
in this house.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.013
I know we can make it work.
We can put it in his dinner.

14:01.971 --> 14:03.799
- I volunteer as tribute.
- Gary?

14:03.843 --> 14:05.888
What the hell
are you doing in there?

14:05.932 --> 14:07.107
- I was cowering from the men

14:07.150 --> 14:08.108
who almost killed me
with the train.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.546
Give me the recipe
to your potion.

14:11.589 --> 14:14.070
I will not fail you.
- Bad idea.

14:14.114 --> 14:16.116
- Uh-huh.
- Do it for Book Club.

14:16.159 --> 14:17.508
- What?
- Are you seriously invoking

14:17.552 --> 14:19.859
Book Club right now?
- Yeah.

14:21.599 --> 14:24.385
- You get one of those.
You get one.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.169
Are you sure?

14:26.213 --> 14:28.955
- Ava, I am invoking Book Club
to ask you to give me

14:28.998 --> 14:30.913
one night with my dad,

14:30.957 --> 14:34.961
and if he is a harmless,
normal man by the end of it...

14:36.571 --> 14:39.748
You let him live.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.930
- Where you going,
Captain Cold?

14:47.974 --> 14:49.149
- Antarctica, of course.

14:49.192 --> 14:50.846
- Yeah, that place
is the worst.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.718
- Well, I'm following up
on the lead that you--

14:55.677 --> 14:59.115
Bloody shape-shifters.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.117
- What?
- Charlie.

15:01.161 --> 15:04.338
She used your face to send me
on some dead-end trail.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.949
Sending me to Antarctica,

15:06.993 --> 15:10.126
freeze my bloody ass off.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.736
No.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.957
I'm getting off
this gormless jam jar.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.567
Since there's no one here
that can help me,

15:16.611 --> 15:19.005
I'll do it my way--
alone.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.879
- All right, I think I got
these stupid crostinis right.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.141
How's the salad?

15:25.185 --> 15:26.186
- Uh, just needs
to be dressed,

15:26.229 --> 15:27.578
and then there's the soup.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.232
- How many courses
did Ray have planned?

15:29.276 --> 15:31.974
- By my count, five.
Six if you include cocktails.

15:32.018 --> 15:32.975
- Come on, Ray!

15:33.019 --> 15:35.151
Nobody gets laid
after six courses.

15:35.195 --> 15:36.979
Gary, how's the potion
coming along?

15:37.023 --> 15:38.024
- Don't rush me; everything
has to be done precisely

15:38.067 --> 15:39.982
or it will not work!
- Okay.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.202
Are you talking entrée?
- It'll be done by dessert.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.726
- Then let's get
this dinner started.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.174
- Uh, hello, you've reached
the office of Sara Lance.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.089
How can I help you?

16:00.133 --> 16:01.438
Well, hello, Mr. Dog.

16:01.482 --> 16:03.005
What is this in reference to?

16:03.049 --> 16:06.052
- Mm, cheers.
- Hmm.

16:07.314 --> 16:08.924
Mmm.
- Mmm.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.012
- Oh, more crostinis.

16:10.056 --> 16:14.060
These are delicious.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.626
Mm.
- Bloody hell.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.020
Gary!

16:25.245 --> 16:29.640
- Damien Darhk.
- John Constantine.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.470
You know, I don't think
we've actually ever met before,

16:33.514 --> 16:35.733
seeing as you're
still breathing.

16:35.777 --> 16:39.085
- Ah, but you have died before,
though, right?

16:39.128 --> 16:40.477
So what's about to happen

16:40.521 --> 16:43.480
should feel a little,
uh, familiar.

16:54.883 --> 16:57.973
That was a heirloom, you--

16:58.017 --> 17:01.281
- Stop it, both of you!
- This vagrant's trespassing!

17:01.324 --> 17:03.544
- This is my house,
you plonker!

17:03.587 --> 17:05.067
- Your house?
Nora, I thought--

17:05.111 --> 17:06.155
- Well...

17:07.591 --> 17:09.637
Technically...

17:09.680 --> 17:12.248
it is his house.

17:12.292 --> 17:15.208
His name is on the title.

17:15.251 --> 17:17.166
But in practice...

17:18.907 --> 17:21.344
It's our house.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.132
Right, babe?

17:26.175 --> 17:28.264
Just go with it.

17:28.308 --> 17:30.745
- Right, love--
my love,

17:30.788 --> 17:35.097
that is, because we are indeed,
uh, together.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.098
- Oh, Nora doll.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.492
Here I thought
you were all alone,

17:38.535 --> 17:41.147
but now I know that you have

17:41.190 --> 17:44.933
a powerful warlock
in your life.

17:44.976 --> 17:47.153
Johnny C,
you bring it in here!

17:47.196 --> 17:50.504
You rascal!

17:50.547 --> 17:54.203
- ♪ The thing about circles
is, they never end ♪

17:54.247 --> 17:57.380
♪ So our friendship
will be universal ♪

17:57.424 --> 17:59.469
- Why does he keep
changing his shoes?

17:59.513 --> 18:02.211
- Oh, changing his shoes
is a soothing ritual

18:02.255 --> 18:04.474
which takes him
from one space to another.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.694
- Where's my fairy godmother?

18:06.737 --> 18:08.522
- She's busy with her father.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.350
- So why are you here
and not there?

18:10.393 --> 18:12.134
- She asked me
to give them space,

18:12.178 --> 18:14.397
and I am respecting
her boundaries.

18:14.441 --> 18:17.618
- She's hiding you
from her dad.

18:17.661 --> 18:20.577
Mr. Parker says you can love
whoever you want to love

18:20.621 --> 18:23.363
and to not be ashamed.

18:23.406 --> 18:25.365
Well, you don't have
to quote season eight,

18:25.408 --> 18:28.498
episode 15 to me, okay?

18:28.542 --> 18:31.371
But look, she's not--I mean,
she's not trying to hide--

18:31.414 --> 18:35.201
- Fairy godmother!
Fairy godmother!

18:35.244 --> 18:37.159
Come here right now!

18:38.987 --> 18:40.771
- It's too late. Too late.
- Damn it, Ray!

18:40.815 --> 18:42.425
I said no summoning!

18:42.469 --> 18:44.340
Do you have any idea how many
plates I'm spinning right now

18:44.384 --> 18:46.168
trying to keep my dad happy?
- Many.

18:46.212 --> 18:49.780
But quick question.
Um, are you hiding me?

18:49.824 --> 18:51.434
- Of course I am.

18:51.478 --> 18:53.654
I am telling him
1,000 lies right now

18:53.697 --> 18:56.178
to make sure nobody
gets killed.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.006
- Oh, well, um,

18:58.049 --> 19:00.356
why not just tell him
the truth?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.228
- Oh!
Oh!

19:02.271 --> 19:03.794
Why not just tell him
the truth?

19:03.838 --> 19:05.231
Um, okay.

19:05.274 --> 19:08.190
Why don't I just tell
my megalomaniac dad

19:08.234 --> 19:11.106
that his little girl is a slave
to the whims of children

19:11.150 --> 19:12.455
and is schtupping
an Eagle Scout?

19:12.499 --> 19:14.457
That sounds amazing.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.546
- The longer you lie
about who you really are,

19:16.590 --> 19:19.375
the harder it's gonna be when
the truth finally comes out.

19:19.419 --> 19:23.640
- Listen, can you just give me
this one night, okay?

19:23.684 --> 19:27.340
Just help me out
and save the guilt trip?

19:27.383 --> 19:29.211
Please, okay?

19:29.255 --> 19:30.212
- Of course.
- Okay?

19:30.256 --> 19:31.431
Good?
- Of course.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.215
- Everything good?
Ah, okay.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.130
Great.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.438
- Good night,
boys and girls.

19:38.481 --> 19:40.091
- Do you need
to change your shoes?

19:42.268 --> 19:43.530
- I think I do.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.317
- I named her Lita after, um--

19:48.361 --> 19:51.364
- Yeah, Lita Ford
of the Runaways.

19:51.407 --> 19:53.409
- Sorry I never told you.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.846
I actually looked you up after
I found out I was pregnant,

19:55.890 --> 19:58.588
but you were in jail.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.329
Again.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.856
- So it, um--it must have been
challenging, uh,

20:05.900 --> 20:08.946
raising a kid by yourself.
- I made it work.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.078
I mean, sure,
Lita would ask about her dad,

20:10.121 --> 20:11.471
but whenever she did I--

20:11.514 --> 20:13.168
- She would just say,
you know,

20:13.212 --> 20:14.865
"My standards were low
and his sperm count was high."

20:14.909 --> 20:16.693
- Okay.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.695
- But, uh, when I learned that

20:18.739 --> 20:20.610
Rebecca Silver
was actually him,

20:20.654 --> 20:23.222
I guess I let it slip that we
had hooked up at our reunion.

20:25.136 --> 20:27.617
Lita's a smart kid.
Guess she figured it out.

20:27.661 --> 20:30.098
- Yeah, my dad writes
crappy novels.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.840
- They're brilliant.
- Debatable.

20:32.883 --> 20:35.277
Either way,
I still hate you.

20:35.321 --> 20:38.367
- Lita, he--he didn't know.

20:38.411 --> 20:39.629
But I guess now that

20:39.673 --> 20:41.370
the pussy cat's
out of the pouch,

20:41.414 --> 20:42.458
get to know one another and--

20:42.502 --> 20:43.546
- Mm.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.896
Sounds like fun.

20:50.205 --> 20:52.468
- No.
What the hell are you doing?

20:52.512 --> 20:54.078
- We were never here.

20:56.777 --> 20:58.953
- True story, that.

20:58.996 --> 21:00.346
- I never knew that.

21:03.697 --> 21:06.352
Wine!
- Ooh!

21:06.395 --> 21:08.354
Good to see you two
getting along.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.791
- Oh, we're just
telling stories, aren't we?

21:10.834 --> 21:12.401
- You know,
I shouldn't be shocked

21:12.445 --> 21:13.968
that you'd be drawn
to a fellow

21:14.011 --> 21:15.361
after your pop's
old line of work.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.232
- Oh, well, you know me, Dad.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.929
I can't help but keep
the family business going.

21:18.973 --> 21:20.148
- That's my girl.

21:20.191 --> 21:21.323
- Not that I could ever live up

21:21.367 --> 21:23.586
to a great collector
of artifacts

21:23.630 --> 21:25.501
such as yourself.
- Mm, mm.

21:25.545 --> 21:28.374
- Oh, but sadly some things
could never be found.

21:28.417 --> 21:31.507
You take, for instance,
the Loom of Fate.

21:32.943 --> 21:35.337
- I never did find that one.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.339
That's because it was scattered
across the multiverse.

21:37.383 --> 21:40.124
- Oh, well, it's all
on one Earth now--

21:40.168 --> 21:42.388
ours.
- Mm.

21:42.431 --> 21:43.693
Intriguing.

21:43.737 --> 21:46.000
Still, you need a Fate
to put it all together

21:46.043 --> 21:47.958
and operate it.
Mm.

21:48.002 --> 21:49.917
- Right, sounds like there's no
point in even looking for it.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.788
Right, John?
- Yeah.

21:51.832 --> 21:54.269
Especially with so many
exciting opportunities

21:54.313 --> 21:56.358
to think about.
Right, babe?

21:56.402 --> 21:58.534
- Yep, maybe not the time.

21:58.578 --> 22:02.016
- I'm sensing something juicy
bubbling with the help.

22:02.059 --> 22:04.453
- Mm, no. I-I don't--

22:04.497 --> 22:06.803
- Is there trouble in paradise?
- Know what?

22:06.847 --> 22:08.588
It's none
of your damn business.

22:08.631 --> 22:10.372
- Oh, sit and spill.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.461
Uncle Damien wants
to hear everything.

22:12.505 --> 22:16.073
- No, they don't have to talk--
- You know what?

22:16.117 --> 22:17.858
Someone forgot
to tell their girlfriend

22:17.901 --> 22:20.600
about a job offer they received
to work in Star City.

22:20.643 --> 22:21.731
- Oh? Ooh.
- Babe.

22:21.775 --> 22:25.039
- Permanently.

22:25.082 --> 22:27.171
- I was gonna talk
to you about it

22:27.215 --> 22:28.738
before it became permanent.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.087
- So you're actually
considering it?

22:30.131 --> 22:31.437
- Yes.
- I don't unders--

22:31.480 --> 22:32.742
Okay, how is that supposed
to work with you there

22:32.786 --> 22:34.657
and me one
of Nora's henchpeople?

22:34.701 --> 22:36.746
- Sara, she's right.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.009
You know, long-distance
relationships can be tough.

22:39.053 --> 22:40.750
- Thank you.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.404
- It wasn't going to be
a long-distance relationship.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.580
I thought that we
could go together.

22:44.624 --> 22:47.453
- This is why I always have
a "no fraternizing" policy

22:47.496 --> 22:49.585
with my staff.
- Mm.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.587
Next course, please!
- Mm.

22:53.850 --> 22:58.115
- The potion is now purple
and therefore...

22:58.159 --> 23:00.683
ready to depower
the supervillain.

23:06.515 --> 23:07.864
- So let me get this straight.

23:07.908 --> 23:11.433
You stood up for yourself
and she shut you down?

23:11.477 --> 23:14.828
- She just doesn't think
that Damien would accept me.

23:14.871 --> 23:15.916
- But aren't you
setting yourself up

23:15.959 --> 23:18.222
for a lifetime of lies?

23:18.266 --> 23:19.659
Will you have to lie
when Damien comes to visit

23:19.702 --> 23:21.835
or when you guys have kids?

23:21.878 --> 23:23.445
- Because you know those babies

23:23.489 --> 23:25.142
are gonna have that
beautiful Palmer jawline.

23:25.186 --> 23:26.709
- The Palmer jawline
is a dominant gene.

23:26.753 --> 23:30.234
- Damn right.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.062
Am I rushing into this?
- Yes!

23:36.545 --> 23:38.286
We couldn't say something
unless you said something.

23:38.329 --> 23:39.374
Ray...

23:41.507 --> 23:43.465
It feels rushed.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.511
- She's embarrassed of you,

23:45.554 --> 23:47.077
after you made
the perfect dinner,

23:47.121 --> 23:48.688
took a massage class,

23:48.731 --> 23:49.906
and hid an engagement ring
in the mousse?

23:49.950 --> 23:53.127
The ring is in the mousse!

23:53.170 --> 23:56.130
- Mm, well, I hope you
saved room for dessert.

23:56.173 --> 23:59.263
Chocolate mousse.

23:59.307 --> 24:01.483
all: Mmm-mmm-mmm!

24:01.527 --> 24:03.485
- Yum.

24:03.529 --> 24:06.314
- Yeah, you should try it.
- Mmm.

24:06.357 --> 24:12.059
- There's no chocolate in hell.
Mousse.

24:12.102 --> 24:13.364
- What are you do--
- Hmm?

24:13.408 --> 24:14.627
What's that?
- Mmm!

24:14.670 --> 24:16.411
Chocolate mousse.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.673
This has always been
your favorite, right, Dad?

24:17.717 --> 24:20.415
- Mm-hmm,
this just looks sinful.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.504
all: Mmm.

24:22.548 --> 24:25.159
- Everybody,
isn't this delicious?

24:25.202 --> 24:27.988
all: Mmm.

24:28.031 --> 24:29.206
- Perfection!

24:35.386 --> 24:36.779
- A ring?

24:36.823 --> 24:38.912
Well, that's unexpected.

24:48.138 --> 24:51.446
I'm surmising
that perhaps that cup

24:51.490 --> 24:54.101
was put in front
of the wrong person.

24:54.144 --> 24:56.799
John, was there a question
that you wanted to ask?

24:56.843 --> 24:58.584
- Question?

24:58.627 --> 25:00.150
Oh, right, yeah.
Um...

25:00.194 --> 25:02.588
The question, of course.

25:14.382 --> 25:17.559
Nora Darhk, uh,
will you marry me?

25:17.603 --> 25:20.954
- Ooh!
Oh, God!

25:20.997 --> 25:23.609
Just when I thought this night
couldn't get any better.

25:23.652 --> 25:26.916
My daughter has found
the love of her life.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.571
Forget the mousse.
More champagne!

25:29.615 --> 25:32.966
- No.
- What?

25:33.009 --> 25:35.055
What?
I'm sorry, what was that?

25:35.098 --> 25:36.186
I'm sorry,
I thought you said no.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.058
- No.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.060
Sh--I know she--
she just said--

25:40.103 --> 25:41.583
I thought she--
did she say no?

25:42.802 --> 25:46.719
- No, I won't marry John,

25:46.762 --> 25:48.198
'cause I can't lie
to you anymore, Dad.

25:48.242 --> 25:49.504
- Oh, thank God.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.592
- No, Johnny C,
Johnny C, Johnny C!

25:50.636 --> 25:52.289
Don't--don't--why?
What are you doing?

25:52.333 --> 25:54.596
- Dad, Sara and Ava
aren't my henchwomen.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.033
They're just my friends.

25:59.688 --> 26:02.778
And I'm not
a powerful sorceress.

26:06.782 --> 26:09.959
I'm a fairy godmother.

26:10.003 --> 26:12.658
Dad, this isn't my house.

26:12.701 --> 26:14.921
John isn't my boyfriend.

26:16.836 --> 26:20.187
He is.

26:20.230 --> 26:24.408
- And I love him madly.

26:24.452 --> 26:25.758
Oh.
- Hi.

26:25.801 --> 26:29.413
Damie--Mr. Darhk,
since you're here,

26:29.457 --> 26:32.460
I was wondering if I
could get your blessing

26:32.503 --> 26:36.682
to have your daughter's hand
in marriage.

26:41.861 --> 26:45.429
- You deceived me,
Nora doll.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.997
Your own father.

26:56.266 --> 26:57.833
You tried to poison me.

26:57.877 --> 26:59.661
- That's--that's not as bad
as it looks.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.361
- I've been gone for less
than two years, and you--

27:04.405 --> 27:06.842
you're a completely
different person.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.110
And I know who's to blame.

27:14.154 --> 27:16.156
- No, no, no, no, no, no, Dad!

27:16.199 --> 27:18.114
Stop!
Stop!

27:18.158 --> 27:20.682
- Brexit!

27:21.944 --> 27:23.685
- Go!
- Let him go!

27:23.729 --> 27:25.252
- Stop, Dad!

27:28.342 --> 27:29.909
Dad, I am not a child!

27:29.952 --> 27:31.867
You can't just kill
my friends anymore!

27:39.919 --> 27:41.311
Did you think you
were gonna kill me

27:41.355 --> 27:43.139
with that little toy, Lance?

27:43.183 --> 27:45.315
- Why don't you give me
a chance to find out?

27:45.359 --> 27:46.360
- L--

28:01.027 --> 28:04.117
- That's no Mongolian relic.

28:05.640 --> 28:08.425
- That's a Hell Sword.

28:08.469 --> 28:11.602
My, oh, my.

28:11.646 --> 28:15.737
I am so going to enjoy

28:21.787 --> 28:23.614

28:23.658 --> 28:24.964

28:25.007 --> 28:26.792
4,000 hours
of children's television.

28:26.835 --> 28:28.619
He's earned it.

28:28.663 --> 28:30.273
- Oi, how have you guys
not noticed the Encore alarm?

28:30.317 --> 28:31.361
both: Oh!

28:33.624 --> 28:35.757
- It's at Constantine's house.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.585
- Ray.
- Let's go.

28:37.628 --> 28:38.586
- I wanna go.

28:38.629 --> 28:39.935
all: No.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.415
- I wish it.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.519
- Now, that guy
is marriage material.

28:58.562 --> 29:00.216
- Quit insulting Ray!

29:00.260 --> 29:02.392
- He made you poison
your own father!

29:02.436 --> 29:04.046
- No, he didn't!
That was my idea!

29:04.090 --> 29:05.613
- That's because
he twisted you.

29:05.656 --> 29:07.963
Look at you.
You're a powerless fairy.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.878
- Oh!
- That's it!

29:09.922 --> 29:12.881
Pippa, make a wish.
- Yes, you can stop this.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.101
- This is the only way
you'll learn.

29:16.755 --> 29:17.843
- I wish you were all

29:49.918 --> 29:52.225
- Hope you're having

29:52.268 --> 29:53.879
I sure am.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.796
Come with me.

29:58.927 --> 30:03.018
- What the--

30:03.062 --> 30:04.541
- Ah, boys and girls,

30:04.585 --> 30:06.805
please welcome my friends
Nora and Damien.

30:06.848 --> 30:08.937
Now, why don't we discuss
our problems?

30:08.981 --> 30:11.244
Damien, what seems
to be on your mind?

30:11.287 --> 30:12.985
- Well, you simpleton,

30:13.028 --> 30:14.813
my child means everything
to me,

30:14.856 --> 30:17.163
and you've completely
corrupted her into this!

30:17.206 --> 30:19.078
- See, this is why
I had to lie.

30:19.121 --> 30:20.949
I knew you couldn't handle it
because emotionally,

30:20.993 --> 30:22.342
you're the child.

30:22.385 --> 30:24.083
- Well, I think this
is gonna be tougher

30:24.126 --> 30:25.911
than we thought, kids.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.347
Why don't we travel
to the land of Make 'Em Ups

30:27.390 --> 30:29.479
with Gary the Unspeakable
Train Abomination?

30:31.090 --> 30:32.569
- A-chugga-chugga,
chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.310
- Hi, Gary.
- Toot-toot, everybody!

30:34.354 --> 30:35.790
Toot-toot!

30:35.834 --> 30:37.879
- Toot-toot to you.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.360
- Chugga-chugga, whee!

30:46.366 --> 30:47.933
Ah.

30:47.976 --> 30:49.630
- Hello, John.

30:49.673 --> 30:51.414
- Hello, Charlie.

30:51.458 --> 30:54.200
- Hey, Ava.
- Yes, Sara?

30:54.243 --> 30:56.028
- Are you bloody kidding me?
Puppets?

30:56.071 --> 30:57.072
Again?

30:57.116 --> 30:59.335
- I wanted to say
that I feel bad

30:59.379 --> 31:01.903
that I made you feel bad.

31:01.947 --> 31:04.863
- Oh, well,
maybe we should communicate.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.995
- I'm sorry I kept
the job offer

31:07.039 --> 31:09.389
in Puppet Star City
a secret.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.521
I was only considering it
because I thought you

31:11.565 --> 31:14.829
wanted to settle down.
- Well, I used to want that,

31:14.873 --> 31:17.136
but I've been having
a lot of fun on the ship.

31:17.179 --> 31:21.183
- Oh, then I'll tell
Puppet Wild Dog to shove it!

31:21.227 --> 31:23.098
both: Yay!

31:23.142 --> 31:26.928
- Maybe you can work out your
problem with communication.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.408
- Yeah!

31:28.451 --> 31:32.020
- You were gonna send me
to the South Pole, Charlie.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.108
- You don't understand
how dangerous

31:33.152 --> 31:34.675
that Loom is, John-o.

31:34.718 --> 31:36.416
It gave my sisters
and me control

31:36.459 --> 31:38.331
over everyone's lives.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.681
Now, I smashed that thing
so we could be free.

31:40.724 --> 31:43.118
People could be free rebel,
free to be weird.

31:43.162 --> 31:44.903
- Oh, come on, Charlie.

31:44.946 --> 31:46.643
If you sensed that the Loom
was in one universe again,

31:46.687 --> 31:48.907
what's to say your sisters
didn't feel it too?

31:48.950 --> 31:50.430
And what's to stop them
going after it

31:50.473 --> 31:51.910
for the wrong reasons?

31:51.953 --> 31:54.477
Listen, I will use the Loom
to help Astra,

31:54.521 --> 31:59.569
and then I will help you
destroy it forever this time.

31:59.613 --> 32:02.659
- Forever.

32:02.703 --> 32:03.965
- Deal?

32:06.489 --> 32:07.969
- Deal.

32:08.013 --> 32:12.104
both: Yay for communication
and cooperation!

32:12.147 --> 32:13.888
- Yay!

32:13.932 --> 32:15.020
- Oh!

32:15.063 --> 32:17.022
I wonder who that is.

32:17.065 --> 32:19.981
It's bike messenger Behrad.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.983
I hope you're having
a wonderful day.

32:22.027 --> 32:24.072
Let's see what was delivered.
- Open it!

32:24.116 --> 32:25.465
Open it!

32:25.508 --> 32:27.815
- It's the Safe Space Sombrero.

32:27.858 --> 32:29.295
- Please make it stop.
Make it just stop.

32:29.338 --> 32:31.601
I am going to just--

32:31.645 --> 32:33.995
- Only the person wearing the
Safe Space Sombrero may speak.

32:41.568 --> 32:43.091
You've ruined her life.

32:43.135 --> 32:45.093
Her life is absolutely
in shambles because of you

32:45.137 --> 32:46.399
and the idiot brigade
she hangs out with.

32:46.442 --> 32:48.009
I mean,
look at her!

32:48.053 --> 32:51.186
She's trapped in this horrible
fairy godmother job!

32:51.230 --> 32:55.103
- Horrible job?
- Mm-hmm.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.540
- You know what, Dad?

32:57.584 --> 33:01.066
My life now,
that's not Ray's choice.

33:01.109 --> 33:03.242
It's mine.

33:03.285 --> 33:05.026
I know you think all magic
should be self-serving,

33:05.070 --> 33:06.462
but I like helping kids,

33:06.506 --> 33:07.898
because being raised
by a demon cult

33:07.942 --> 33:10.901
instead of my own father...

33:10.945 --> 33:13.208
that wasn't my choice.

33:13.252 --> 33:15.123
That was yours.

33:17.560 --> 33:21.042
So maybe working with kids
helps me cope with that.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.304
And you're right.

33:22.348 --> 33:25.307
I'm not the Nora doll
you remember.

33:25.351 --> 33:28.180
I like who I am,

33:28.223 --> 33:29.746
and I'm never going back.

33:32.532 --> 33:36.101
- I've been an ass.

33:36.144 --> 33:40.757
I've had this vision of this...
life that would make you happy.

33:42.281 --> 33:44.674
Obviously I was wrong.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.546
- I just want you
to be proud of me.

33:46.589 --> 33:48.983
- Proud of...

33:49.027 --> 33:52.160
Nora doll,
I am.

33:52.204 --> 33:54.293
- Really?

33:56.251 --> 33:58.297
- I really am.

34:04.999 --> 34:07.306
- Oh, kids, look!

34:07.349 --> 34:08.350
The sun is smiling!

34:15.140 --> 34:17.533
- I thought my family
was messed up,

34:17.577 --> 34:22.016
but these guys
are truly deranged.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.803
I wanna be with
my own family now.

34:26.847 --> 34:29.371
Fairy godmother,
I release you.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.422
- It worked!

34:36.465 --> 34:38.163
I've been cured.

34:38.206 --> 34:41.122
I'm not afraid
of trains anymore!

34:41.166 --> 34:43.037
- No hard feelings, Ray?

34:47.172 --> 34:49.783
- Yes.

34:49.826 --> 34:51.263
- Yes?

34:51.306 --> 34:54.614
- Yes.
Yes.

34:54.657 --> 34:57.399
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

34:57.443 --> 34:59.358
I love you so much.

34:59.401 --> 35:00.794
I'm so sorry I tried
to hide you.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.752
I can't wait to marry you.

35:02.796 --> 35:05.059
- I can't wait to marry you.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.408
- So let's--let's do it.

35:06.452 --> 35:08.367
Let's do it.
Let's do it right now.

35:08.410 --> 35:09.237
- Right now?
- Right now.

35:09.281 --> 35:11.196
I'm off duty.
My dad's here.

35:11.239 --> 35:14.329
His schedule's unpredictable,
so let's--let's--let's do it.

35:14.373 --> 35:17.854
Right now.
Tonight.

35:17.898 --> 35:19.160
- Yeah.
Okay.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.422
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:20.466 --> 35:21.858
- Okay.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.430
You're not married yet.

36:59.304 --> 37:03.133
- ♪ You send my heart higher
than a firework ♪

37:03.177 --> 37:06.920
♪ I can feel your adulation

37:06.963 --> 37:08.487
♪ Confetti falling down
from the universe ♪

37:08.530 --> 37:10.228
- Champagne?

37:10.271 --> 37:11.664
- I wanna tell you
how much I appreciate

37:11.707 --> 37:13.361
everything you've done
for my daughter.

37:13.405 --> 37:16.234
- Thank you,
but, um,

37:16.277 --> 37:18.323
I haven't really
done that much.

37:18.366 --> 37:22.240
She's pretty incredible
all on her own.

37:22.283 --> 37:25.199
- Yeah, but you make her happy.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.896
That's something that
I ultimately failed at

37:26.940 --> 37:30.291
when I was the main man
in her life.

37:30.335 --> 37:32.337
- Well, you know,
I-I think

37:32.380 --> 37:33.816
you're being
too hard on yourself.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.818
- I don't need a pep talk.

37:35.862 --> 37:39.387
But I do need you
to do something for me.

37:39.431 --> 37:42.564
I need you to support her.
- Of course. Always.

37:42.608 --> 37:43.739
- No, I don't think
you understand

37:43.783 --> 37:45.524
what I'm trying to say.

37:45.567 --> 37:48.527
Nora's job
is very important to her,

37:48.570 --> 37:52.531
and she can't do it on that
silly little ship of yours.

37:52.574 --> 37:55.316
Nora belongs in the real world,

37:55.360 --> 37:58.188
and you belong together.

37:58.232 --> 38:01.540
I hope you understand
what I'm trying to say here.

38:09.199 --> 38:10.636
Do the right thing, son,

38:10.679 --> 38:12.420
or I'll come back and get you.

38:12.464 --> 38:15.075
I'm only kidding.

38:15.118 --> 38:17.033
- Okay.
That's what I thought.

38:17.077 --> 38:18.339
- But not really.

38:39.665 --> 38:41.710
- Eating your feelings,
I see?

38:43.321 --> 38:45.410
- She's better off without me.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.542
- She reached out to you
for a reason.

38:52.112 --> 38:55.420
- She's an idiot.
I'm an idiot.

38:55.463 --> 38:57.770
She's a pain in the ass.
I'm a pain in the ass.

38:57.813 --> 39:00.338
The fact that she's not already
in juvie is a miracle,

39:00.381 --> 39:02.905
and it proves one thing.
- What?

39:02.949 --> 39:05.995
- I'm no good for her.
- Are you sure about that?

39:12.611 --> 39:14.264
- You know what?
- Hmm?

39:14.308 --> 39:17.833
- You've inspired me
to forgo this evil thing.

39:17.877 --> 39:20.619
Maybe this old dog can learn
some new tricks.

39:20.662 --> 39:23.361
- So you'll stick around
for a bit?

39:23.404 --> 39:24.927
- Oh, I think it's time
both of us

39:24.971 --> 39:27.930
move on to the next chapter.

39:27.974 --> 39:30.585
- Promise you'll check in on me
once in a while?

39:30.629 --> 39:33.458
- Of course.

39:33.501 --> 39:36.461
I'll never be far.

39:36.504 --> 39:39.420
- ♪ I used to question
everything ♪

39:39.464 --> 39:42.118
♪ My eyes couldn't see

39:42.162 --> 39:44.469

39:44.512 --> 39:46.906

39:46.949 --> 39:50.257

40:05.968 --> 40:08.101
- ♪ I get to love you, babe

40:11.147 --> 40:14.324
- Hey!

40:25.118 --> 40:27.381
- Taking off already?

40:27.425 --> 40:29.862
Oh, I hate prolonged good-byes.

40:29.905 --> 40:31.559
I'd rather slip out
while everyone's in there

40:31.603 --> 40:33.474
still having a good time.
- Mm.

40:33.518 --> 40:35.476
So where are you going?

40:35.520 --> 40:39.480
- I was given this Encore
under certain conditions.

40:39.524 --> 40:41.177
I was ordered
to cause pain and misery

40:41.221 --> 40:42.744
and damn more souls to hell.

40:42.788 --> 40:46.313
- But instead you decided
to check in on your Nora doll.

40:48.358 --> 40:51.492
I just wanted to make sure
that my little girl's okay,

40:51.536 --> 40:53.189
and she is,

40:53.233 --> 40:55.583
thanks to the help
of you idiots.

40:55.627 --> 41:00.719
Plus, Astra's gonna recall me
soon to an eternity of torture.

41:00.762 --> 41:02.242
I didn't wanna bum
my daughter out

41:02.285 --> 41:03.591
with all of that
on her wedding night.

41:12.992 --> 41:15.734
I know you'll never forgive me.

41:15.777 --> 41:19.607
To tell you the truth...
I won't either.

42:16.142 --> 42:17.535
- Greg, move your head.
