Speed. I am speed.

00:45.038 --> 00:46.596
[Cars whizzing past]

00:46.673 --> 00:49.403
One winner, 42 losers.

00:49.475 --> 00:52.035
I eat losers for breakfast.

00:52.111 --> 00:54.079
[Car accelerating]

00:54.147 --> 00:55.580
Breakfast.

00:55.648 --> 00:57.741
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

00:57.817 --> 01:01.514
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

01:01.587 --> 01:03.145
[Cars whizzing]

01:03.222 --> 01:05.452
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

I am lightning!

[Pounding on door]

Get your antenna balls here!

02:50.496 --> 02:52.657
Go, Lightnin'!

02:52.732 --> 02:56.725

- [Male] Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
- [Crowd cheers]

03:25.631 --> 03:29.260
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

03:29.335 --> 03:32.327
<i>We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.</i>

03:32.405 --> 03:34.430
<i>Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof.</i>

03:34.507 --> 03:38.102
<i>If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!</i>

03:38.177 --> 03:39.235
<i>Right, Darrell.</i>

03:39.312 --> 03:41.940
<i>[Bob] Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,</i>

03:42.014 --> 03:44.107
<i>heading into the final race
of the season.</i>

03:44.183 --> 03:48.950
<i>And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.</i>

03:49.021 --> 03:50.716
<i>Does The King, Strip Weathers,</i>

03:50.790 --> 03:53.190
<i>have one more victory in him
before retirement?</i>

03:53.259 --> 03:55.853
<i>[Darrell] He's been Dinoco's golden boy
for years!</i>

03:55.928 --> 03:58.123
<i>Can he win them one last Piston Cup?</i>

03:58.197 --> 04:01.564
<i>[Bob] And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.</i>

04:01.634 --> 04:04.159
<i>He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.</i>

04:04.237 --> 04:06.398
<i>[Darrell] Chick thought
this was his year.</i>

04:06.472 --> 04:09.236
<i>His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.</i>

04:09.308 --> 04:13.369
<i>But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!</i>

04:13.446 --> 04:16.074
<i>[Bob] You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.</i>

04:16.148 --> 04:18.776
<i>The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.</i>

04:18.851 --> 04:20.341
<i>But everyone knows him now.</i>

04:20.418 --> 04:24.480
<i>[Darrell] Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?</i>

04:24.590 --> 04:27.150
<i>[Bob] The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!</i>

04:27.226 --> 04:30.093
<i>Three cars, one champion!</i>

04:33.766 --> 04:35.097
[Breaks screeching]

What a ride!

04:57.423 --> 04:58.685
[Chuckling]

04:58.758 --> 05:00.953
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

05:04.764 --> 05:06.595
[Female] I love you, Lightning!

05:06.666 --> 05:09.328
- Dinoco is all mine.
- [Screaming]

05:09.402 --> 05:11.336
[Darrell] Trouble, turn three!

05:11.404 --> 05:14.635
- Get through that, McQueen.
- [Bob] Huge crash behind the leaders!

05:14.707 --> 05:15.696
[Crowd gasps]

05:17.076 --> 05:20.375

05:30.990 --> 05:33.254
[Both screaming]

05:36.529 --> 05:39.396
[Bob] Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

05:39.465 --> 05:42.298
[Darrell] There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

05:42.368 --> 05:43.596
Not in one piece, that is.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.272
[Exhaling]

05:58.217 --> 05:59.912
Yeah!

05:59.986 --> 06:01.954
Lightning! Oh!

06:03.856 --> 06:06.324
[Darrell] Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

06:06.392 --> 06:08.860
[Bob] A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

06:08.928 --> 06:11.055
Yeah! Ka-chow!

06:11.130 --> 06:14.395
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

06:14.467 --> 06:17.436
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow! [honking]

06:17.503 --> 06:19.733
[Bob] While everyone
heads into the pits,

06:19.805 --> 06:21.568
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

06:21.641 --> 06:24.633
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

06:24.710 --> 06:27.440
[Air wrench whirring]

06:29.382 --> 06:31.850
[Chuckling] What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

06:31.917 --> 06:33.851
- McQueen made it!
- [Chick] What?

06:33.919 --> 06:34.977
He's not pitting!

06:35.054 --> 06:38.182
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

06:38.257 --> 06:40.020
McQueen's not going into the pits!

06:40.092 --> 06:43.653
[Darrell] The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

06:43.729 --> 06:46.027
- [Bob] Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

06:46.098 --> 06:48.328
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

06:48.401 --> 06:51.802
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

06:51.871 --> 06:54.271
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

06:57.076 --> 07:00.068
[Crowd cheers]

07:12.525 --> 07:14.254
Come on, come on, come on!

07:22.635 --> 07:24.728
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

07:24.804 --> 07:27.500
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- [Male] What?

07:27.640 --> 07:29.699
You need tires, you idiot!

07:30.042 --> 07:33.011
[Darrell] Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

07:33.079 --> 07:34.512
[Bob] Right. No tires again.

07:34.580 --> 07:37.276
[Darrell] That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

07:37.349 --> 07:41.012
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

07:44.724 --> 07:47.625
[Cars whizzing]

07:49.128 --> 07:53.360
[Bob] This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

07:53.432 --> 07:56.299
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

07:56.368 --> 07:58.666
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

07:58.738 --> 08:00.933
[Crowd cheers and whistles]

08:01.006 --> 08:03.236
[Screaming]

08:05.144 --> 08:07.374
- Checkered flag, here I come!
- [Tire blows]

08:07.446 --> 08:09.437
[Darrell] No! McQueen's blown a tire!

08:09.515 --> 08:12.245
[Bob] And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

08:12.318 --> 08:14.878
- You fool!
- [Grunts]

08:16.255 --> 08:18.723
[Male] McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!

08:18.791 --> 08:20.281
Go, go, go!

08:27.933 --> 08:29.400
- [Grunting]
- [Tire blows]

08:29.468 --> 08:31.197
[Darrell] He's lost another tire!

08:31.270 --> 08:34.501
- King and Chick come up fast!
- [Bob] They're entering turn three!

08:34.573 --> 08:36.438
Come on. [grunting]

08:38.309 --> 08:40.539
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

08:40.613 --> 08:44.140
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

08:45.184 --> 08:46.515
[Gasping]

08:48.087 --> 08:49.247
[Growling]

08:49.889 --> 08:52.483
[Bob] The King and Chick
rounding turn four.

08:55.361 --> 08:58.626
[Darrell] Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

08:58.697 --> 09:01.495
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

09:01.567 --> 09:02.932
Lightning!

09:03.235 --> 09:06.227
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

09:06.305 --> 09:09.763
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

09:09.842 --> 09:11.867
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

09:13.345 --> 09:15.142

09:18.417 --> 09:20.214
<i>[Slow motion drone]</i>

09:22.555 --> 09:25.581
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

09:25.658 --> 09:27.853
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

09:27.927 --> 09:27.993
<i>We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.</i>

09:27.993 --> 09:30.461
<i>We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.</i>

09:30.529 --> 09:32.997
<i>McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.</i>

09:33.065 --> 09:34.054
<i>Tell me about it!</i>

09:34.133 --> 09:36.795
<i>Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?</i>

09:36.869 --> 09:40.305
<i>Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.</i>

09:40.372 --> 09:44.274
<i>I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?</i>

09:44.343 --> 09:46.277
<i>I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.</i>

09:46.345 --> 09:48.472
<i>- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?</i>

09:48.547 --> 09:50.708
<i>No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.</i>

09:50.783 --> 09:52.216
<i>What? Oh, yeah, right.</i>

09:52.284 --> 09:54.343
<i>That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.</i>

09:54.420 --> 09:57.048
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

09:57.122 --> 09:58.817
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

09:58.891 --> 10:00.586
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

10:00.659 --> 10:02.650
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

10:02.728 --> 10:06.323
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

10:06.398 --> 10:10.459
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

10:10.536 --> 10:12.231
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

10:12.304 --> 10:16.070
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

10:16.141 --> 10:17.130
[Crowd laughs]

10:17.209 --> 10:20.110
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

10:20.179 --> 10:21.840
Oh, whatever.

10:21.914 --> 10:23.939
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

10:24.016 --> 10:27.315
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

10:27.386 --> 10:29.616
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

10:29.688 --> 10:32.213
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

10:32.291 --> 10:34.953
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

10:35.027 --> 10:39.589
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

10:39.665 --> 10:41.496
In your dreams, Thunder.

10:41.567 --> 10:44.661
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

10:44.737 --> 10:47.570
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.437
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

10:49.508 --> 10:51.942
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

10:52.011 --> 10:53.706
- Give us the bolt!
- That's right.

10:53.779 --> 10:55.246
Right in the lens.

10:55.414 --> 10:57.575
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!

10:57.650 --> 11:00.949
- Show me the bolt, McQueen!
- That's it!

11:01.020 --> 11:03.420
[Electronic music]

11:03.489 --> 11:06.185
[Crowd chattering]

11:06.258 --> 11:10.718
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

11:10.796 --> 11:11.785
Thank you, King.

11:11.864 --> 11:14.628
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.065
It's the least I could do.

11:16.135 --> 11:19.366
Whatever happens, you're a winner
to me, you old daddy rabbit.

11:19.438 --> 11:22.236
Thanks, dear.
Wouldn't be nothing without you.

11:22.308 --> 11:24.003
Kch-i-ka-chow!

11:25.077 --> 11:26.738
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.

11:26.812 --> 11:30.077
[Both] We're, like, your biggest fans!
Ka-chow!

11:30.149 --> 11:32.640
I love being me.

- We love you, Lightning!

11:35.888 --> 11:37.719
[Chuckles]

11:37.790 --> 11:40.623
Hey, buddy.
You're one gutsy racer.

11:40.693 --> 11:42.251
Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

11:42.328 --> 11:44.125
You got more talent in one lug nut

11:44.196 --> 11:46.756
than a lot of cars has got
in their whole body.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.426
- Really? Oh, that...
- But you're stupid.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.061
- Excuse me?
- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

11:52.137 --> 11:55.231
You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

11:55.307 --> 11:58.333
You ain't gonna win
unless you got good folks behind you,

11:58.410 --> 12:01.709
[voice dwindling] and you let them
do their job, like they should.

12:01.780 --> 12:04.510
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.

12:04.583 --> 12:06.483
- Yeah...
- [electronic music]

12:35.581 --> 12:37.572
Oh, Lightning!

12:39.018 --> 12:41.851
If you figure that out
you just gonna be OK.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.549
Oh, yeah, that...
That is spectacular advice.

12:45.624 --> 12:47.057
Thank you, Mr. The King.

12:47.126 --> 12:49.219
- [Fanfare]
- [Bob] Ladies and gentlemen,

12:49.294 --> 12:51.524
for the first time
in Piston Cup history...

[rewing] A rookie
has won the Piston Cup.

12:55.701 --> 12:56.759
Yes!

12:56.835 --> 12:59.770
[Bob]... we have a three-way tie.

- [Crowd cheers]
- [Cameras flash]

13:06.612 --> 13:09.479
[Chuckling] Hey,
that must be really embarrassing.

13:09.548 --> 13:12.210
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

13:13.285 --> 13:16.686
[Bob] Piston Cup officials
have determined that a tiebreaker race

13:16.755 --> 13:20.987
between the three leaders
will be held in California in one week.

13:21.226 --> 13:24.491
Well, thank you! Thanks to
all of you out there! Thank you!

13:24.563 --> 13:28.260

- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

29:14.712 --> 29:16.236
- Cool!
- Mater!

29:16.314 --> 29:19.181
What did I tell you
about talkin' to the accused?

29:19.250 --> 29:20.740
To not to.

29:20.818 --> 29:25.255
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

29:25.323 --> 29:27.416
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

29:27.492 --> 29:30.359
[Chuckling] "Later, Mater."
That's funny!

29:30.628 --> 29:31.617
Ah!

29:31.696 --> 29:35.393
[Sheriff] The Radiator Springs
Traffic Court will come to order!

29:35.466 --> 29:38.993
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

29:39.070 --> 29:41.470
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!

29:41.539 --> 29:42.563
- Fascist!
- Commie!

29:42.640 --> 29:45.336
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?

29:45.410 --> 29:47.173
I gotta get to California, pronto.

29:47.245 --> 29:48.405
Where's your lawyer?

29:48.479 --> 29:51.744
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

29:51.816 --> 29:56.947
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

29:57.021 --> 29:59.012
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

30:00.391 --> 30:02.723
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

30:02.794 --> 30:06.560
All rise! The Honorable
Doc Hudson presiding.

30:06.898 --> 30:08.024
Show-off.

30:08.099 --> 30:11.432
- May Doc have mercy on your soul.
- [Door banging]

30:11.502 --> 30:12.696
- [Gasping]
- All right,

30:12.770 --> 30:15.898
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

30:15.973 --> 30:17.873
I want his hood on a platter!

30:17.942 --> 30:20.604
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

30:20.678 --> 30:24.444
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

30:24.515 --> 30:28.178
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

30:28.252 --> 30:29.776
I'm...

30:31.756 --> 30:33.690
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

30:33.758 --> 30:37.125
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

30:37.261 --> 30:38.853
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

30:38.930 --> 30:41.194
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

30:41.265 --> 30:42.732
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

30:43.768 --> 30:47.761
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

30:47.839 --> 30:50.307
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

30:50.374 --> 30:52.808
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

30:52.877 --> 30:54.811
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

30:54.879 --> 30:58.042
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

30:58.116 --> 31:01.677
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

31:02.086 --> 31:03.713
- What the...? Ow! Oh!
- Ka-chow!

31:03.788 --> 31:06.848
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

31:06.991 --> 31:10.518
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

31:10.595 --> 31:12.256
- [Rewing]
- Agh! Ow!

31:12.330 --> 31:14.730
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

31:14.799 --> 31:16.824
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

31:16.901 --> 31:20.667
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

31:20.738 --> 31:23.332
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

31:23.407 --> 31:27.104
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

31:27.211 --> 31:29.179
Ka-ching!

31:29.247 --> 31:30.339
Ah!

31:30.481 --> 31:32.415
I'll keep that in mind.

31:32.583 --> 31:34.983
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

31:35.353 --> 31:37.651
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

31:38.389 --> 31:39.378
You know her?

31:39.457 --> 31:42.426
She's the town attorney and my fiancee.

31:42.493 --> 31:43.482
What?

31:43.561 --> 31:47.657
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

31:47.732 --> 31:51.566
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

31:51.636 --> 31:53.297
What do you want, Sally?

31:53.371 --> 31:56.738
[Sighing] Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

31:56.807 --> 31:59.970
No. I know his type. Racecar.

32:00.044 --> 32:02.103
That's the last thing this town needs.

32:02.180 --> 32:06.674
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

32:06.751 --> 32:10.687
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

32:10.755 --> 32:12.188
Here she goes again.

32:12.256 --> 32:14.952
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

32:15.026 --> 32:18.655
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

32:18.729 --> 32:22.529
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

32:22.600 --> 32:25.592
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

32:25.670 --> 32:26.830
Ignore him.

32:26.904 --> 32:30.271
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

32:30.341 --> 32:32.673
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

32:32.743 --> 32:35.541
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

32:35.613 --> 32:37.103
And if no one can get to you?

32:37.181 --> 32:41.515
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

32:41.586 --> 32:44.419
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

32:44.488 --> 32:47.889
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

32:47.959 --> 32:51.486
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

32:51.562 --> 32:55.054
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

32:55.132 --> 32:58.260
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

32:58.336 --> 33:00.896
- [All] Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

33:00.972 --> 33:03.805
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

33:03.874 --> 33:07.105
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

33:07.178 --> 33:09.408
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

33:09.480 --> 33:11.505
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

33:11.582 --> 33:12.571
Oh, he can do it.

33:12.650 --> 33:15.448
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

33:15.519 --> 33:16.986
[All] Fix the road!

33:17.054 --> 33:20.615
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

33:20.691 --> 33:21.953
[All cheer]

33:22.026 --> 33:25.223
[Honking] Order in the court!

33:25.997 --> 33:28.761
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

33:28.833 --> 33:30.824
- [All] Yeah!
- No!

33:30.901 --> 33:32.232
[VW van] Nice ruling.

33:32.970 --> 33:36.462
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

33:36.540 --> 33:40.408
[Chuckling] That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

33:40.611 --> 33:42.306
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

33:42.380 --> 33:45.008
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

33:45.082 --> 33:47.744
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

33:47.818 --> 33:49.513
[Gurgling]

33:49.954 --> 33:53.913
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

33:53.991 --> 33:57.051
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

33:57.128 --> 33:59.858
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

33:59.930 --> 34:02.262
What? This place is crazy!

34:02.333 --> 34:04.494
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

34:04.568 --> 34:07.560
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

34:07.638 --> 34:08.627
What?

34:08.706 --> 34:12.266
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

34:12.342 --> 34:13.935
You gotta be kidding me.

34:14.011 --> 34:16.672
You start there where the road begins.

34:17.047 --> 34:20.040
You finish down there
where the road ends.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.283
[Mater] Holy shoot!

34:24.822 --> 34:27.222
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

34:27.291 --> 34:30.851
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

34:30.928 --> 34:32.088
Five days?

34:32.163 --> 34:35.098
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

34:35.166 --> 34:38.135
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

34:38.202 --> 34:40.693
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

34:42.340 --> 34:44.900
[Grunting]

34:44.975 --> 34:48.411
[Tires squealing, engine rewing]

34:48.779 --> 34:51.009
[Lightning] Freedom!

34:56.320 --> 34:59.847
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

35:00.624 --> 35:03.923
...and then...
then took the boot off.

35:05.396 --> 35:07.796
Whoo-hoo!

35:08.532 --> 35:12.525
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

35:12.603 --> 35:16.471
California, here I come! Yeah!

35:18.843 --> 35:20.834
Oh, feel that wind.

35:21.278 --> 35:22.870
Yes!

35:22.947 --> 35:23.971
[Sputtering]

35:24.048 --> 35:26.073
No. No, no, no.

35:26.384 --> 35:28.682
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

35:28.753 --> 35:30.744
How can I be outta gas?

35:30.821 --> 35:34.780
[Chuckling] Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

35:34.859 --> 35:37.191
[Stuttering] But how did,
how did... you...?

35:37.261 --> 35:39.593
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

35:39.663 --> 35:42.564
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

35:50.975 --> 35:53.375
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

35:53.444 --> 35:54.536
Hey, Sheriff.

35:54.612 --> 35:56.876
<i>- Why here?
- [Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.</i>

35:56.947 --> 35:59.438
<i>- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.</i>

35:59.517 --> 36:01.382
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

36:01.452 --> 36:04.285
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

36:04.355 --> 36:07.188
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

36:07.258 --> 36:09.988
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

36:10.060 --> 36:12.961
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

36:13.030 --> 36:16.397
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

36:16.467 --> 36:18.697
That's why we made him the judge.

36:18.869 --> 36:23.033
<i>Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>

36:23.107 --> 36:24.472
Now, I'm not one to brag

36:24.542 --> 36:27.841
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

36:28.312 --> 36:29.336
Oh!

36:29.413 --> 36:32.246
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

36:32.316 --> 36:34.113
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

36:34.185 --> 36:36.449
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

36:36.520 --> 36:41.219
- [Snorting, hacking]
- No, no, no!

36:41.292 --> 36:43.624
That won't be necessary.

36:44.695 --> 36:47.994
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

36:48.065 --> 36:50.693
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

36:53.137 --> 36:54.126
Where's he goin'?

36:54.205 --> 36:57.641
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

36:57.708 --> 36:59.232
I shouldn't put up with this.

36:59.310 --> 37:02.177
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

37:02.246 --> 37:05.272
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

37:05.549 --> 37:08.746
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

37:08.819 --> 37:11.447
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

37:11.522 --> 37:15.515
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

37:15.593 --> 37:17.891
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

37:17.962 --> 37:20.055
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

37:20.130 --> 37:22.121
I must scream it to the world!

37:22.199 --> 37:26.431
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

37:26.504 --> 37:28.995
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

37:29.073 --> 37:32.042
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

37:32.810 --> 37:35.745
- [Lightning] What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

37:40.618 --> 37:43.178
Is that what I think it is?

37:44.755 --> 37:46.017
[Sally] Customers.

37:46.090 --> 37:49.548
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

37:49.627 --> 37:50.992
- [Sally] OK!
- Customers?

37:51.061 --> 37:53.894
[Sally] Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

37:53.964 --> 37:56.524
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

37:56.600 --> 38:00.127
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

38:00.204 --> 38:02.866
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

38:02.940 --> 38:07.343
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

38:07.411 --> 38:10.073
- Honey, please.
- [Sally] Hello.

38:10.147 --> 38:13.116
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

38:13.183 --> 38:15.447
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

38:15.519 --> 38:16.543
How can we help you?

38:16.620 --> 38:20.681
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

38:20.758 --> 38:23.989
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

38:24.061 --> 38:26.495
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

38:26.564 --> 38:29.397
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

38:29.466 --> 38:32.526
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

38:32.603 --> 38:36.664
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

38:36.740 --> 38:38.435
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

38:38.509 --> 38:41.706
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

38:41.779 --> 38:45.112
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

38:45.182 --> 38:47.514
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

38:47.585 --> 38:49.917
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

38:49.987 --> 38:53.150
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

38:53.223 --> 38:56.954
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

38:57.027 --> 39:00.485
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

39:00.564 --> 39:04.500
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Cafe.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

39:04.568 --> 39:05.728
No we just topped off.

39:05.803 --> 39:09.671
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

39:09.740 --> 39:12.208
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

39:12.276 --> 39:15.609
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

39:15.679 --> 39:18.842
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

39:18.916 --> 39:21.214
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

39:21.285 --> 39:22.616
Maybe ghost flames!

39:22.686 --> 39:25.246
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

39:25.322 --> 39:29.224
- [Both gasp]
- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

39:29.293 --> 39:32.319
[Chuckling] OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

39:32.396 --> 39:33.886
Ow!

39:33.964 --> 39:37.161
[Laughs] A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

39:37.401 --> 39:39.494
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

39:39.570 --> 39:43.062
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

39:44.675 --> 39:46.734
[Van] OK! Yes. You bet.

39:46.810 --> 39:49.074
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

39:49.146 --> 39:52.240
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

39:52.316 --> 39:54.477
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

39:54.551 --> 39:57.213
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:57.287 --> 39:58.754
No, not really. But listen.

39:58.822 --> 40:02.451
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

40:02.526 --> 40:05.051
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

40:05.129 --> 40:08.963
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

40:09.933 --> 40:12.197
<i>- [Locks beeping]
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

40:12.269 --> 40:16.137
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

40:16.206 --> 40:19.369
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

40:19.443 --> 40:21.536
I'm becoming one of them!

40:21.612 --> 40:23.341
- [Lightning echoes]
- [Sighing]

40:23.414 --> 40:25.541
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

40:25.616 --> 40:27.379
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

40:27.451 --> 40:30.318
<i>[Male DJ] We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...</i>

40:30.387 --> 40:33.117
<i>- That's good.
...after a Piston Cup update.</i>

40:33.190 --> 40:37.092
<i>[Kori] Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California</i>

40:37.161 --> 40:40.619
<i>and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.</i>

40:40.698 --> 40:43.861
<i>[Chick] It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.</i>

40:43.934 --> 40:47.700
<i>You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.</i>

40:47.771 --> 40:49.238
[Electronic music]

40:49.306 --> 40:51.069
[Laughing]

40:51.141 --> 40:52.938
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

40:58.015 --> 40:59.004
Ha-ha!

41:02.853 --> 41:03.842
Yeah!

41:05.122 --> 41:07.215
[Crowd shouting and cheering]

41:12.129 --> 41:15.394
[Girls chattering and giggling]

41:15.466 --> 41:17.798
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

41:18.268 --> 41:20.099
[Gasping] Oh!

41:20.170 --> 41:21.535
Let me get this straight.

41:21.605 --> 41:24.540
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

41:24.608 --> 41:28.339
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

41:28.412 --> 41:29.504
I got a road to finish.

41:30.814 --> 41:33.214
[Grunting and rewing]

41:41.358 --> 41:43.758
- He's done!
- Done?

41:43.827 --> 41:46.193
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

41:48.132 --> 41:51.465
- [Bessie groans]
- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

41:51.535 --> 41:54.402
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

41:55.005 --> 41:58.668
[Mater] Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

41:59.243 --> 42:00.835
Oh!

42:02.179 --> 42:04.875
[Vibrating] It rides purty smooth.

42:05.115 --> 42:08.573
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

42:08.685 --> 42:12.177
- Oh!
- [Blubbering]

42:12.556 --> 42:14.547
Red.

42:17.161 --> 42:18.492
Who do you think you are?

42:18.562 --> 42:21.861
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

42:21.932 --> 42:25.368
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

42:25.435 --> 42:27.903
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

42:27.971 --> 42:31.600
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

42:31.675 --> 42:33.165
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

42:33.243 --> 42:37.475
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

42:37.548 --> 42:41.348
- What?
- [Chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?

42:41.418 --> 42:43.784
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

42:43.854 --> 42:46.550
If I win, you do the road my way.

42:46.623 --> 42:48.147
Doc, what're you doin'?

42:48.525 --> 42:50.356
I don't mean to be rude here,

42:50.427 --> 42:54.158
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

42:54.231 --> 42:56.756
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

42:56.834 --> 43:01.498
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

43:03.240 --> 43:05.765
[Sheriff] Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

43:05.843 --> 43:10.337
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

43:10.414 --> 43:13.349
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

43:13.417 --> 43:15.942
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

43:16.019 --> 43:21.150
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

43:21.225 --> 43:22.988
and no lollygaggin'.

43:23.060 --> 43:24.618
Speed. I'm speed.

43:24.695 --> 43:27.255
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

43:27.331 --> 43:28.355
[Luigi laughs]

43:28.498 --> 43:33.299
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

43:33.370 --> 43:35.895
- Peet stop!
- Uh... [chuckles]

43:35.973 --> 43:38.840
The race is only one lap, guys.

43:38.909 --> 43:41.400
<i>Uno lappo! Don't need any help.</i>

43:41.478 --> 43:45.312
<i>- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.</i>

43:46.617 --> 43:50.485
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

43:50.587 --> 43:52.578
Gentlemen...

43:53.223 --> 43:56.056
...start your engines!

43:58.195 --> 43:59.856
[Engine sputters]

44:00.297 --> 44:02.765
[Rewing furiously]

44:02.833 --> 44:05.199
<i>- Hijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.</i>

44:05.269 --> 44:08.363
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

44:08.739 --> 44:10.036
Luigi?

44:10.107 --> 44:13.304
[Chuckling] On your mark, get set...

44:13.377 --> 44:15.607
<i>Uno for the money,
due for the show,</i>

44:15.679 --> 44:21.379
<i>tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!</i>

44:22.719 --> 44:23.811
[Giggling]

44:25.422 --> 44:27.322
[Cheering]

44:29.860 --> 44:31.191
Huh?

44:31.828 --> 44:34.353
Doc... the flag means go.

44:34.431 --> 44:37.764
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

44:37.834 --> 44:40.564
Doc, what are you doing, man?

44:40.637 --> 44:44.198
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

44:44.274 --> 44:47.402
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

44:47.477 --> 44:50.241
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

44:51.949 --> 44:53.382
You got your tow cable?

44:53.450 --> 44:55.645
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

44:55.719 --> 44:58.017
[Doc] Oh, just in case.

45:06.563 --> 45:08.758
[Yelling] Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

45:08.832 --> 45:10.561
No, no, no, no, no!

45:10.701 --> 45:13.101
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

45:13.837 --> 45:16.135
- Ow!
- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.

45:16.206 --> 45:17.639
[Rewing]

45:19.309 --> 45:25.305
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

45:25.382 --> 45:27.748
- I'm confused.
- [Chuckling]

45:27.818 --> 45:29.911
[Doc] You drive like you fix roads.

45:29.987 --> 45:33.184
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

45:36.994 --> 45:38.825
[Gasps] Ah!

45:39.563 --> 45:42.532
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

45:42.599 --> 45:45.727
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

45:48.839 --> 45:50.773
I can make a little turn on dirt.

45:50.841 --> 45:52.274
You think?

45:52.342 --> 45:56.802
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

45:56.880 --> 45:59.348
<i>Hey, ese!
You need a new paint job, man!</i>

45:59.416 --> 46:02.385
- [Lightning] No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

46:02.452 --> 46:04.818
- That freak juice?
- [Lightning] Pass.

46:04.888 --> 46:09.348
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

46:09.426 --> 46:11.018
Nah, not me, Flo.

46:11.094 --> 46:13.562
I'm on one of them there special diets.

46:13.630 --> 46:18.226
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

46:18.802 --> 46:21.066
"You race like you fix roads."

46:21.138 --> 46:25.905
[Grunting] I'll show him.
[Grunting] I will show him!

46:34.251 --> 46:38.585
- [Tar splattering]
- Oh, great! I hate it!

46:38.655 --> 46:42.284
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- [Chuckles] Music. Sweet music.

46:43.493 --> 46:46.053
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

46:46.129 --> 46:48.859
[Lightning]
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

46:48.932 --> 46:51.958
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

46:54.504 --> 46:58.304
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

47:11.354 --> 47:12.412
Wow.

47:12.756 --> 47:14.451
[Mater] Mornin', Sally!

47:14.524 --> 47:19.723
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

47:19.796 --> 47:21.821
Yes! Uh, amazing!

47:22.299 --> 47:25.928
Whoa-ho! Yeah! [sighing]

47:26.002 --> 47:30.200
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

47:30.273 --> 47:32.833
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

47:32.909 --> 47:37.039
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

47:37.114 --> 47:39.309
<i>[Italian] E bellissima! It's beautiful!</i>

47:39.382 --> 47:43.113
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

47:44.054 --> 47:45.351
Boy, I tell you what.

47:45.422 --> 47:48.255
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

47:48.325 --> 47:49.986
Doc, look at this!

47:50.127 --> 47:52.994
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

47:53.063 --> 47:56.555
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

47:56.633 --> 47:59.602
Guido, look at Luigi!

48:00.203 --> 48:01.932
<i>This is fantastico!</i>

48:02.005 --> 48:05.463
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

48:05.542 --> 48:09.842
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

48:10.514 --> 48:13.210
That crazy old devil woman.

48:13.683 --> 48:17.084
[Sighs] Oh!

48:17.154 --> 48:18.985
She's right!

48:19.055 --> 48:20.613
- Ah!
- Guido!

48:20.690 --> 48:24.456
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

48:25.729 --> 48:29.529
Well, now... where the heck is he?

48:35.872 --> 48:38.602
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

48:38.675 --> 48:42.042
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

48:42.112 --> 48:44.478
and asked me if he could
come down here.

48:44.548 --> 48:46.948
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

48:47.017 --> 48:49.850
[Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

48:50.320 --> 48:52.845
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

48:55.058 --> 48:59.017
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

48:59.095 --> 49:00.494
I'll keep an eye on him.

49:00.564 --> 49:04.466
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

49:06.136 --> 49:08.934
[Engine rewing]

49:12.309 --> 49:14.300
[Screaming]

49:15.912 --> 49:18.107
[Spitting]

49:18.848 --> 49:21.316
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

49:21.384 --> 49:24.114
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

49:24.187 --> 49:27.520
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

49:27.591 --> 49:31.083
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

49:31.161 --> 49:34.221
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

49:34.297 --> 49:37.391
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

49:37.467 --> 49:39.128
I'll put it simple.

49:39.202 --> 49:43.366
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

49:44.441 --> 49:49.845
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

49:49.913 --> 49:51.710
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

49:51.781 --> 49:55.376
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

49:58.188 --> 50:01.589
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

50:02.826 --> 50:04.657
[Groans]

50:09.232 --> 50:11.166
[Lightning] Turn right to go left.

50:12.435 --> 50:14.426
Hmm...

50:14.504 --> 50:15.562
Whoa!

50:16.940 --> 50:19.374
- Oh!
- [Car crashing]

50:19.843 --> 50:23.802
- Ow! Oh, that...
- [cactus crashing]

50:25.382 --> 50:28.749
[Screaming] Ow!

50:30.186 --> 50:33.451
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

50:33.523 --> 50:36.617
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

50:36.693 --> 50:40.094
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

50:40.163 --> 50:44.099
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

50:50.974 --> 50:54.535
<i>- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
- Che cosa?</i>

50:54.611 --> 50:58.980
<i>- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>

50:59.983 --> 51:01.507
[Grunts, passes gas]

51:01.584 --> 51:03.575
Oh, Lord.

51:03.653 --> 51:05.280
- [Chuckles]
- [Sheriff] Mater!

51:05.355 --> 51:07.516
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

51:07.590 --> 51:10.889
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

51:10.960 --> 51:13.793
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

51:13.863 --> 51:16.331
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

51:17.434 --> 51:19.095
[Groaning] Oh...

51:19.169 --> 51:21.831
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

51:21.905 --> 51:24.465
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

51:24.541 --> 51:27.806
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

51:27.877 --> 51:30.175
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

51:30.246 --> 51:32.271
You make-a such a nice new road.

51:32.349 --> 51:35.011
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

51:35.085 --> 51:36.677
Even though you not a Ferrari.

51:36.753 --> 51:40.849
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

51:40.924 --> 51:44.792
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

51:44.861 --> 51:48.388
[Chuckling] I like your style, eh?

51:48.465 --> 51:52.026
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

51:52.102 --> 51:55.560
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

51:55.638 --> 51:57.299
[Flo] Oh, would you look at that?

51:57.374 --> 51:59.501
Ramone, Ramone!

51:59.576 --> 52:01.669
[Luigi] Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

52:01.745 --> 52:04.737
[Lightning] No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

52:04.814 --> 52:08.443
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

52:08.518 --> 52:13.217
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

52:13.289 --> 52:16.156
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

52:16.226 --> 52:17.488
[Exhales deeply]

52:17.560 --> 52:18.720
Ah!

52:18.795 --> 52:20.922
Stop! Let me...

52:22.332 --> 52:25.165
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

52:25.235 --> 52:27.260
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

52:27.337 --> 52:30.670
Stop, stop! That's cold!

52:30.740 --> 52:33.231
Help! Please! Stop!

52:33.309 --> 52:36.676
- [Coughing, sputtering]
- Thanks, Red.

52:37.914 --> 52:39.176
What was that for?

52:39.249 --> 52:41.376
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

52:41.451 --> 52:42.941
If you do, you gotta be clean.

52:43.019 --> 52:45.544
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

52:45.622 --> 52:47.351
What, I...? I don't get it.

52:47.424 --> 52:50.018
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

52:50.093 --> 52:53.324
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

52:53.396 --> 52:58.026
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

52:58.101 --> 53:01.969
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

53:02.038 --> 53:04.438
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

53:04.507 --> 53:07.772
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

53:07.844 --> 53:11.041
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.

53:11.114 --> 53:14.572
[Lightning chuckles] Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

53:14.651 --> 53:18.781
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

53:18.855 --> 53:22.222
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

53:23.726 --> 53:25.956
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

53:26.930 --> 53:29.398
Cone number one, if you want.

53:30.500 --> 53:32.866
Oh...

53:34.003 --> 53:37.734
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

53:37.807 --> 53:40.901
Oh... [chuckles]
That's just a... Oh!

53:40.977 --> 53:43.138
[Both chuckle]

53:43.480 --> 53:46.813
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

53:46.883 --> 53:49.511
Gonna... Yeah.

53:54.257 --> 53:56.851
- You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
- [Gasps]

53:56.926 --> 53:58.416
Good-lookin' girl.

53:58.495 --> 54:01.794
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

54:01.865 --> 54:05.357
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

54:06.469 --> 54:08.937
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

54:09.005 --> 54:13.135
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

54:13.209 --> 54:17.373
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

54:17.447 --> 54:21.008
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

54:21.084 --> 54:23.382
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

54:23.453 --> 54:25.216
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

54:25.288 --> 54:28.280
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

54:28.358 --> 54:30.690
I can handle anything.

54:30.760 --> 54:35.595
- [Whispering] I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it! [chuckles]

54:35.865 --> 54:39.392
- [Mater] Tractor-tippin's fun.
- [Lightning] This is ridiculous.

54:39.469 --> 54:41.903
- [Tractors snore]
- [Mater] All right, listen.

54:41.971 --> 54:45.964
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

54:46.042 --> 54:47.873
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

54:48.878 --> 54:50.846
[Lightning whispering] Mater!

54:50.914 --> 54:52.347
Wait, Mater!

54:54.117 --> 54:55.482
OK, here's what you do.

54:55.552 --> 54:58.953
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

54:59.022 --> 55:01.513
And they do the rest. Watch this.

55:08.565 --> 55:10.396
- [Honking loudly]
- Oh!

55:10.466 --> 55:15.665
Oh... Oh! Oh... [mooing]

55:15.738 --> 55:19.538
[Gas sloshing, backfiring]

55:19.609 --> 55:22.510
[Laughing loudly]

55:22.579 --> 55:25.707
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

55:25.782 --> 55:29.582
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

55:29.652 --> 55:32.246
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

55:35.224 --> 55:37.818
- [Honking]
- Oh!

55:37.894 --> 55:41.489
Oh! Oh... [mooing]

55:41.564 --> 55:44.465
[Gas sloshing, backfiring]

55:44.534 --> 55:48.527
[Laughing] I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

55:48.605 --> 55:50.368
Oh, your turn, bud.

55:50.440 --> 55:52.840
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

55:52.909 --> 55:55.139
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

55:55.211 --> 55:56.200
[Clucking]

55:56.279 --> 55:59.680
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

56:06.723 --> 56:09.658

56:48.600 --> 56:50.329
[Mooing]

56:50.636 --> 56:52.035
That's Frank.

56:54.606 --> 56:57.131
- [Bellowing angrily]
- [Shouting]

56:58.410 --> 57:01.902
- [Mooing]
- [Engine rewing]

57:07.185 --> 57:11.519

57:11.590 --> 57:14.286

57:14.359 --> 57:16.350
- Here he comes, look out!

57:44.322 --> 57:45.414
Oh! Customers!

57:46.358 --> 57:48.121
Oh!

57:49.928 --> 57:51.520
Ah, no, no, no.

57:51.596 --> 57:53.325
Oof! Oh!

57:54.866 --> 57:57.767
[Mater] Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

57:57.836 --> 58:01.328
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

58:01.606 --> 58:05.702
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!

58:05.777 --> 58:07.711
Oh, yeah... yeah.

58:07.779 --> 58:10.873
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

58:10.949 --> 58:14.146
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

58:14.219 --> 58:15.208
Oh...

58:15.287 --> 58:20.554
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

58:20.625 --> 58:24.891
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

58:24.963 --> 58:28.865
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

58:28.934 --> 58:31.664
- Where, where?
- [Laughing]

58:31.737 --> 58:34.331
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

58:34.406 --> 58:36.567
- [Mater] Yes, you do.
- [Lightning] No way.

58:36.641 --> 58:37.835
- Way.
- Come on, look...

58:37.909 --> 58:40.343
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.

58:40.412 --> 58:42.039
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

58:42.114 --> 58:43.979
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

58:44.049 --> 58:46.074
You love her!
You love her. You love her.

58:46.151 --> 58:47.675
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

58:47.753 --> 58:49.744
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

58:49.821 --> 58:53.120
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

58:53.191 --> 58:58.094
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

58:58.163 --> 59:01.291
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!

59:01.366 --> 59:04.028
[Lightning] What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

59:04.102 --> 59:05.501

59:06.705 --> 59:09.173
- Mater!

59:27.192 --> 59:28.523
Oof!

59:28.593 --> 59:31.994
[Blubbering] Yee-hee!

59:32.464 --> 59:34.329
[Chuckling] He's nuts.

59:36.168 --> 59:37.863
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

59:40.672 --> 59:42.401
Just need to know where I've been.

59:42.474 --> 59:45.602
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

59:45.677 --> 59:49.670
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

59:49.748 --> 59:52.979
[Chuckling] Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

59:53.051 --> 59:56.578
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

59:58.089 --> 01:00:01.820
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

01:00:01.893 --> 01:00:04.225
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

01:00:04.296 --> 01:00:07.322
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

01:00:07.399 --> 01:00:10.960
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

01:00:11.036 --> 01:00:12.697
with private helicopters.

01:00:12.771 --> 01:00:16.036
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

01:00:16.107 --> 01:00:18.234
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

01:00:20.045 --> 01:00:23.674
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

01:00:23.748 --> 01:00:26.911
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

01:00:27.252 --> 01:00:31.951
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

01:00:32.023 --> 01:00:36.619
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

01:00:36.695 --> 01:00:39.493
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

01:00:39.564 --> 01:00:41.327
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

01:00:41.566 --> 01:00:45.366
I knew it. I knowed
I made a good choice!

01:00:45.437 --> 01:00:47.268
In what?

01:00:48.173 --> 01:00:50.107

01:00:56.548 --> 01:00:58.277

a kick out of that, didn't he?

How could you have...

01:05:05.159 --> 01:05:08.253
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.

01:05:08.329 --> 01:05:11.355
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

01:05:11.432 --> 01:05:13.957
Of course. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:15.764
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

01:05:15.836 --> 01:05:19.499
You used to hold the record for most
wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.

01:05:19.573 --> 01:05:22.303
- You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
- I tried that.

01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:25.106

Look at those trophies!

01:05:25.179 --> 01:05:28.615

could really lower your RPM's, man.

Oh, take a car wash, hippie.

Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!
Whoo! That's your color!

01:05:44.398 --> 01:05:48.129
- [Ramone] Yellow, baby.
- Mmm. You smokin' hot!

01:05:48.202 --> 01:05:49.260
There he is.

Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

01:05:55.576 --> 01:05:58.340
- Doc? Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.

01:05:58.412 --> 01:06:01.006
No, no, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.

He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:06.716

drive more than 20 miles an hour.

01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:12.518
No, but I wish I could have.
They say he was amazing!

- He did what in his cup?

startin' to get to the boy!

Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

[Ramone] I think he needs
a new coat of poly, man.

- You are lookin' peaked.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.203

- It's OK. You can trust me, right?

I trust you, all right.
It's him I'm worried about.

01:06:37.752 --> 01:06:40.084
Hmm... I trust him.

01:06:41.055 --> 01:06:43.353
- Come on, let's take a drive.
- A drive?

01:06:43.424 --> 01:06:44.721
Yeah, a drive.

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:47.920

- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

01:07:27.635 --> 01:07:30.069
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

01:07:31.105 --> 01:07:33.073
That's so too much!

01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:37.577
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

Wheel Well.

on the mother road.

You know, I don't get you.

How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

01:10:07.828 --> 01:10:10.023
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

01:10:10.097 --> 01:10:14.261
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:17.896
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

01:10:17.972 --> 01:10:21.373
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

01:10:22.142 --> 01:10:24.770
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

01:10:24.845 --> 01:10:26.608
And you know what?

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:30.309
It never felt... happy.

01:10:31.952 --> 01:10:35.046
Yeah. I mean... really?

01:10:35.122 --> 01:10:36.851
Yeah. So I left California.

01:10:36.924 --> 01:10:40.223
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

01:10:40.961 --> 01:10:43.759
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

01:10:43.831 --> 01:10:46.823
Well, they all did. And I never left.

01:10:48.102 --> 01:10:49.797
Yeah. You know, I understand.

01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:52.703
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

01:10:52.773 --> 01:10:56.504
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

01:10:57.478 --> 01:11:00.936
[Inhaling heavily] I fell in love.

01:11:01.015 --> 01:11:04.678
- Oh.
- Yep.

- No.

They don't even know
what they're missing!

01:11:38.852 --> 01:11:41.184
[Sally] Well,
it didn't used to be that way.

01:11:42.656 --> 01:11:43.987
Oh, yeah?

01:11:44.058 --> 01:11:47.960
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.

01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:50.085
Really?

01:11:50.164 --> 01:11:52.860
[Sally] Yeah. Back then,

01:11:52.933 --> 01:11:55.800
cars came across the country
a whole different way.

01:11:57.071 --> 01:11:58.402
How do you mean?

01:11:58.472 --> 01:12:01.873
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.

01:12:01.942 --> 01:12:06.140
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.

01:12:07.648 --> 01:12:09.639
- Mornin'!
- Nice day, huh?

01:12:11.552 --> 01:12:14.350
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.

01:12:14.421 --> 01:12:16.981
They drove on it to have a great time.

01:12:50.991 --> 01:12:53.391

The town got bypassed
just to save ten minutes of driving.

01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:26.678
[Lightning] How great would it have been
to see this place in its heyday!

01:14:26.753 --> 01:14:29.551
Oh, I can't tell you how many times
I've dreamed of that.

01:14:29.623 --> 01:14:33.286

find a way to get it back on the map.

Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

01:14:37.097 --> 01:14:38.928

never to go back.

01:21:46.693 --> 01:21:49.526
I knowed you wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

01:21:49.596 --> 01:21:52.326
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.

01:21:52.399 --> 01:21:56.062
Don't worry. I'll give you
a police escort, and we'll make up time.

01:21:56.136 --> 01:21:57.296
Thank you, Sheriff.

01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:59.497
But you know I can't go just yet.

01:21:59.572 --> 01:22:01.062
Well, why not?

01:22:01.141 --> 01:22:03.974
- I'm not sure these tires...
- [Luigi gasps excitedly]

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:06.945
...can get me to California.
- Peet stop?

01:22:07.013 --> 01:22:10.278
Yeah, does anybody know
what time Luigi's opens?

01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:11.685
[Laughing] I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!

01:22:11.685 --> 01:22:13.516
[Laughing] I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.314
<i>Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!</i>

01:22:16.389 --> 01:22:20.485
- Would you look at that!
- [Luigi] Our first customer in years!

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.155
I am filled with tears of ecstasy,

01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:28.098
for this is the most glorious day
of my life!

01:22:28.168 --> 01:22:32.161
All right, Luigi, give me
the best set of blackwalls you've got.

01:22:32.372 --> 01:22:33.600
No! No, no, no.

01:22:33.673 --> 01:22:37.040
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.

01:22:38.178 --> 01:22:42.547
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.

01:22:42.615 --> 01:22:44.082
But-a this...

01:22:44.384 --> 01:22:46.215
Whitewall tires!

01:22:46.286 --> 01:22:51.451
They say, "Look at me!
Here I am! Love me."

01:22:51.524 --> 01:22:53.321
All right, you're the expert.

01:22:53.393 --> 01:22:56.328
- [Snarling]
- [Lightning] Don't forget the spare.

01:22:56.396 --> 01:22:59.229
<i>- Perfetto. Guido!
- Peet stop!</i>

<i>[Chuck Berry: Route 66]</i>

01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:13.545
[Laughing] What did Luigi tell you, eh?

01:23:13.613 --> 01:23:17.071
Wow, you were right.
Better than a Ferrari, huh?

01:23:17.851 --> 01:23:19.011
Eh... No.

01:23:22.889 --> 01:23:26.484
Wow! This organic fuel is great!
Why haven't I heard about it before?

01:23:26.559 --> 01:23:28.550
It's a conspiracy, man!

01:23:28.628 --> 01:23:31.096
The oil companies got a grip
on the government!

01:23:31.164 --> 01:23:34.395
They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.

01:23:34.467 --> 01:23:36.594
OK, I'll take a case.

01:23:51.651 --> 01:23:53.118
Ow! Eh!

01:23:53.186 --> 01:23:54.448

[Ramone] Ah... Yeah.

- [Lightning] Places, everybody. Hurry!

<i>- Hi, Sally.
- Buon giorno!</i>

01:24:12.772 --> 01:24:14.603
All right, what's goin' on?

01:24:14.674 --> 01:24:16.835
Ladies and gentlecars,

01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:20.846
please welcome
the new Lightning McQueen!

01:24:21.481 --> 01:24:23.472
Pow! What do you think?

01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:25.745
Radiator Springs
looks pretty good on me.

01:24:25.819 --> 01:24:27.616
[Chuckling] I'll say.

01:24:27.687 --> 01:24:30.884
[Purring] Ka-chow.

01:24:30.957 --> 01:24:33.482
You're gonna fit right in
in California.

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:37.488
My goodness. It looks like
you've helped everybody in town.

01:24:37.564 --> 01:24:39.395
Yeah, everybody except one.

01:24:40.633 --> 01:24:45.627
- Hey, is it getting dark out?
- What? What'd he say?

01:24:45.705 --> 01:24:48.731
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?

01:24:48.808 --> 01:24:51.003
Now, what was I
supposed to do after that?

01:24:51.077 --> 01:24:53.375
<i>[The Chords: Sh-Boom]</i>

01:25:15.001 --> 01:25:17.799
[Gasping] They fixed their neon!

01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:30.205
- Low and slow?
- Oh, yeah, baby! [chuckling]

01:25:30.283 --> 01:25:32.877
[Flo laughs and shrieks]

01:25:34.521 --> 01:25:37.854
Just like in its heyday, right?

01:25:37.924 --> 01:25:41.291
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

01:26:02.916 --> 01:26:05.282
[Chuckling]

01:26:08.721 --> 01:26:10.154
Shall we cruise?

01:26:10.223 --> 01:26:12.555
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

01:26:12.625 --> 01:26:14.092
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:18.494
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

01:26:18.565 --> 01:26:21.432
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

01:26:21.501 --> 01:26:24.868
- Of course, Mater.
- Uh-uh-uh!

01:26:26.306 --> 01:26:29.207
[Mooing]

01:26:31.344 --> 01:26:35.713
...and again and I said, "No."
He asked me again, and I said, "No."

01:26:35.782 --> 01:26:40.116
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

01:26:40.186 --> 01:26:43.587
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive."

01:26:45.758 --> 01:26:48.750
- Oh!
- [Mater chuckling]

01:26:53.099 --> 01:26:55.226
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

01:26:55.301 --> 01:26:57.599
Good evenin', you two.

01:27:00.106 --> 01:27:05.339
Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.

01:27:09.449 --> 01:27:13.249
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

01:27:13.319 --> 01:27:18.985
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

01:27:19.058 --> 01:27:21.652
Not that. That.

01:27:21.728 --> 01:27:21.794
[Sally gasps] Customers?

01:27:21.794 --> 01:27:24.126
[Sally gasps] Customers?

01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:26.859
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!

01:27:26.933 --> 01:27:29.094
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

01:27:29.168 --> 01:27:30.157
[All gasp]

01:27:30.236 --> 01:27:32.830
It's the ghostlight!

01:27:32.905 --> 01:27:35.499
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

01:27:36.376 --> 01:27:37.843
McQueen, over here!

01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:40.674
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?

01:27:40.747 --> 01:27:42.874
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

01:27:42.949 --> 01:27:45.679
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tires balding?

01:27:45.752 --> 01:27:46.741
[Sally] Stickers!

01:27:46.819 --> 01:27:48.980
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!

01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:51.523
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',

01:27:51.591 --> 01:27:54.788
but I was in charge of huntin' him down
if he tried to escape.

01:27:54.861 --> 01:27:56.453
Sally! Sally!

01:27:56.529 --> 01:27:58.588
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

01:27:58.665 --> 01:28:00.394
- Stickers?
- Sally!

- Come on, give us some bolt!

You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

01:28:07.507 --> 01:28:10.874
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

01:28:10.943 --> 01:28:14.811
[Chuckling] You are a sight

01:28:14.881 --> 01:28:17.611
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

01:28:17.684 --> 01:28:19.549

- Yeah. He's in the back.

01:28:26.426 --> 01:28:29.361
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

01:28:29.429 --> 01:28:32.694

- Actually, this is my good side here.

01:28:32.999 --> 01:28:35.024

<i>You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?</i>

01:28:52.418 --> 01:28:54.886
<i>That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.</i>

01:28:54.954 --> 01:28:57.252
<i>Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.</i>

01:28:57.323 --> 01:28:59.848

<i>Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?</i>

Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

01:30:02.922 --> 01:30:06.153

I don't get you in the truck right now!

[Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

01:32:38.811 --> 01:32:41.109
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:43.410
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

01:32:43.482 --> 01:32:45.950
[Darrell] There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

01:32:46.018 --> 01:32:48.578
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

but let me tell you somethin'.

I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

01:33:06.472 --> 01:33:08.804
[Bob] In fact, the country
has almost shut down

01:33:08.874 --> 01:33:12.970
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."

01:33:13.045 --> 01:33:15.673
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

01:33:15.748 --> 01:33:19.844

Hey, you! No admittance

Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

01:33:41.707 --> 01:33:46.667
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

01:33:46.746 --> 01:33:50.648
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

01:33:50.716 --> 01:33:51.978

01:34:01.627 --> 01:34:02.821
Victory.

01:34:02.895 --> 01:34:05.022
One winner, two losers.

01:34:05.097 --> 01:34:07.065
[Engine rewing]

01:34:07.133 --> 01:34:12.662
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

01:34:12.738 --> 01:34:15.298
[birds singing]

01:34:16.776 --> 01:34:17.765
[Knock on door]

01:34:17.843 --> 01:34:19.435
[Mack] Lightnin'! You ready?

01:34:19.512 --> 01:34:22.208
[Gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

01:34:25.484 --> 01:34:28.476
[Indistinct chatter]

01:34:35.561 --> 01:34:38.394
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

01:34:38.464 --> 01:34:41.058
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

01:34:41.133 --> 01:34:43.533
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

01:34:43.602 --> 01:34:45.968
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

01:34:51.343 --> 01:34:53.334
[All shouting]

01:34:53.412 --> 01:34:55.141
[Gulping]

01:35:03.255 --> 01:35:04.654
Uh-oh

01:35:08.661 --> 01:35:11.289
- [cheering, laughing]
- [Giggling]

01:35:15.534 --> 01:35:18.503
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

01:35:18.671 --> 01:35:20.901
[Bob] And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

01:35:20.973 --> 01:35:24.101
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

01:35:24.176 --> 01:35:26.576
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

01:35:26.645 --> 01:35:29.705
[Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:33.978
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

01:35:34.053 --> 01:35:35.213
[Chuckling]

01:35:35.287 --> 01:35:37.619
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

01:35:37.690 --> 01:35:40.591
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

01:35:40.659 --> 01:35:43.651
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

01:35:43.729 --> 01:35:46.892
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

01:35:53.739 --> 01:35:55.798
Agh! Shoot!

01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:59.003
[Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

01:36:02.648 --> 01:36:05.173
[Crowd cheering]

01:36:05.284 --> 01:36:06.842
Come on, you can do it!

01:36:06.919 --> 01:36:08.944
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

01:36:10.156 --> 01:36:13.353
[Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

01:36:13.425 --> 01:36:16.656
[Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

01:36:18.831 --> 01:36:20.992
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

01:36:21.066 --> 01:36:23.466
[Bob] Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

01:36:23.536 --> 01:36:25.265
[Darrell] He lost momentum,

01:36:25.337 --> 01:36:27.635
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

01:36:31.544 --> 01:36:34.536
- [Soft music]
- [Birds singing]

01:36:35.881 --> 01:36:36.973
[Breaks squealing]

01:36:37.049 --> 01:36:39.108
[Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!

01:36:39.185 --> 01:36:40.209
[All gasp]

01:36:43.088 --> 01:36:45.682
[Chuckling] Just me
and the old man, fellas.

01:36:45.758 --> 01:36:49.285
- McQueen just doesn't have it today.
- [All laugh]

01:36:49.361 --> 01:36:50.385
[Groans]

01:36:50.462 --> 01:36:54.523
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.033
I don't think I...

01:36:56.101 --> 01:36:58.831
[Doc] I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

01:36:59.071 --> 01:37:00.595
Doc?

01:37:03.275 --> 01:37:05.903
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

01:37:05.978 --> 01:37:09.744
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

01:37:09.815 --> 01:37:11.715
You said you'd never come back.

01:37:11.784 --> 01:37:15.379
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

01:37:15.454 --> 01:37:18.355
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

01:37:18.424 --> 01:37:20.289
[Chuckles]

01:37:22.328 --> 01:37:25.820
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

01:37:25.898 --> 01:37:29.163
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

01:37:29.235 --> 01:37:31.226
Now, get back out there!

01:37:33.472 --> 01:37:36.441
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

01:37:36.508 --> 01:37:38.806
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

01:37:38.877 --> 01:37:42.040
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

01:37:42.114 --> 01:37:43.809
Kid, you can beat these guys.

01:37:43.882 --> 01:37:47.283
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

01:37:56.528 --> 01:37:58.928
[Murmuring]

01:37:58.998 --> 01:38:00.898
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

01:38:00.966 --> 01:38:04.732
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

01:38:04.803 --> 01:38:07.431
[Bob] It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

01:38:07.506 --> 01:38:09.906
And look who he has for a crew chief!

01:38:09.975 --> 01:38:12.671
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

01:38:12.745 --> 01:38:16.078
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:20.643
[Crowd cheering]

01:38:20.719 --> 01:38:22.744
<i>[Bob] Wow, this is history
in the making.</i>

01:38:22.821 --> 01:38:25.722
<i>Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!</i>

01:38:25.791 --> 01:38:27.190
Hey, Doc!

01:38:27.259 --> 01:38:31.423
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

01:38:36.335 --> 01:38:40.135
- [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!
- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.

01:38:40.205 --> 01:38:43.106
[Bob] Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

01:38:43.175 --> 01:38:46.076
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

01:38:46.145 --> 01:38:47.737
<i>Vai! Vai, vai!</i>

01:38:47.813 --> 01:38:50.714
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

01:38:50.783 --> 01:38:54.219
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

01:38:54.286 --> 01:38:55.310
[All laugh]

01:38:55.387 --> 01:38:57.981
<i>Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?</i>

01:38:58.057 --> 01:39:01.220
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

01:39:15.674 --> 01:39:18.472
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

01:39:20.045 --> 01:39:21.307
What do you think of this?

01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:23.541
- [Tires squealing]
- Yeah, that's it, kid.

01:39:26.852 --> 01:39:28.149
What?

01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:30.017
Whoa! Git-R-done!

01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:36.056
- [Laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

01:39:36.128 --> 01:39:39.097
[Bob] What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

01:39:39.164 --> 01:39:40.995
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

01:39:41.066 --> 01:39:44.229
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

01:39:47.873 --> 01:39:51.070
[Chortling]
Look at that boy go out there!

01:39:56.782 --> 01:39:59.080
[Chick] Oh! [grunting]

01:40:00.018 --> 01:40:01.576
No, you don't.

01:40:02.721 --> 01:40:04.586
[Tire blows]

01:40:04.656 --> 01:40:06.647
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

01:40:06.725 --> 01:40:10.161
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:13.528
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

01:40:15.467 --> 01:40:17.594
[Mack] We gotta get him
back out there fast

01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:20.604
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

01:40:20.672 --> 01:40:22.833
Guido! It's time.

01:40:27.112 --> 01:40:30.206
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

01:40:32.818 --> 01:40:35.309
[Air wrench whirring]

01:40:39.324 --> 01:40:40.757
[Darrell] I don't believe it!

01:40:40.826 --> 01:40:42.521
[Bob] That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

01:40:42.594 --> 01:40:45.154
[Darrell] It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

01:40:45.230 --> 01:40:46.925
[Bob] It's gonna be close.

01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:51.068
- Yeah, baby!
- [All hollering]

01:40:51.136 --> 01:40:52.501
<i>[Darrell] He's back in!</i>

01:40:53.839 --> 01:40:54.828
Peet stop.

01:40:56.275 --> 01:40:58.209
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

01:41:13.492 --> 01:41:16.552
[Bob] This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

01:41:16.628 --> 01:41:18.994
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

01:41:19.064 --> 01:41:22.591
[Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

01:41:22.668 --> 01:41:23.930
This is it, kiddo.

01:41:24.002 --> 01:41:26.493
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

01:41:26.572 --> 01:41:29.006
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

01:41:29.074 --> 01:41:30.473
- Go!
- [Rewing]

01:41:33.178 --> 01:41:34.304
We'll see about that!

01:41:35.814 --> 01:41:37.372
[Bob] McQueen's going inside!

01:41:40.352 --> 01:41:43.378
- Chick and King are loose!
- [Darrell] I think McQueen's out!

01:41:54.066 --> 01:41:56.534
- McQueen saved it!
- [Bob] He's back on the track!

01:41:56.935 --> 01:41:59.597
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

01:42:00.672 --> 01:42:04.301
- Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...
- [all cheer]

01:42:05.878 --> 01:42:08.870
[Darrell] Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

01:42:08.947 --> 01:42:11.040
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

01:42:12.551 --> 01:42:16.351
[Grunts] I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

01:42:26.698 --> 01:42:28.598
- Oh, no!
- [Crowd gasps]

01:42:37.876 --> 01:42:40.037
[Breaks screeching]

01:42:42.481 --> 01:42:43.778
[Engine idling]

01:42:47.119 --> 01:42:49.314
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

01:42:49.388 --> 01:42:53.119
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

01:42:54.426 --> 01:42:56.553
[Flo] What's he up to, Doc?

01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:06.861
[Grunting, moaning]

01:43:06.939 --> 01:43:08.304
What are you doin', kid?

01:43:08.373 --> 01:43:11.604
I think The King
should finish his last race.

01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:17.772
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

01:43:17.849 --> 01:43:21.444
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:23.579
It's just an empty cup.

01:43:25.691 --> 01:43:28.251
[Bob] Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

01:43:28.327 --> 01:43:31.990
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.

01:43:32.064 --> 01:43:34.362
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:43:34.433 --> 01:43:37.129
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

01:43:37.202 --> 01:43:39.466
- That's what I call racin'.
- [Sobbing]

01:43:39.538 --> 01:43:41.005
[Laughing]

01:43:43.008 --> 01:43:46.000
[Crowd cheers wildly]

01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:58.480
<i>- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!</i>

01:43:58.557 --> 01:44:01.151
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

01:44:01.226 --> 01:44:05.754
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

01:44:07.799 --> 01:44:11.235
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

01:44:11.303 --> 01:44:12.702
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

01:44:12.771 --> 01:44:15.740
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

01:44:15.807 --> 01:44:18.935
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

01:44:19.011 --> 01:44:21.241
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

01:44:21.313 --> 01:44:24.908
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

01:44:24.983 --> 01:44:28.282
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

01:44:28.353 --> 01:44:29.820
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

01:44:29.988 --> 01:44:31.512
- Boo!
- Boo!

01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:34.684
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:36.853
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

01:44:42.768 --> 01:44:45.259
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

01:44:47.673 --> 01:44:50.107
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

01:44:50.175 --> 01:44:52.166
You're The King! Yeah!

01:44:52.678 --> 01:44:54.942
[Crowd cheers]

01:44:59.685 --> 01:45:02.518
[Laughing and cheering]

01:45:02.587 --> 01:45:06.045
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

01:45:09.261 --> 01:45:11.889
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

01:45:12.097 --> 01:45:13.758
Thanks, Doc.

01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:16.231
Hey, Lightnin'.

01:45:16.301 --> 01:45:18.963
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

01:45:19.871 --> 01:45:22.897
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

01:45:22.974 --> 01:45:25.738
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

01:45:30.449 --> 01:45:31.916
But I didn't win.

01:45:31.983 --> 01:45:35.646
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

01:45:35.721 --> 01:45:38.417
[Clank] He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

01:45:38.490 --> 01:45:42.654
- buzzards used to circle the car!
- [All laugh]

01:45:42.728 --> 01:45:44.457
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

01:45:44.529 --> 01:45:48.260
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

01:45:49.801 --> 01:45:51.530
I'm gonna stick with them.

01:45:51.603 --> 01:45:54.663
Well, I sure can respect that.

01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:55.900
Still, you know,

01:45:55.974 --> 01:45:59.842
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

01:45:59.911 --> 01:46:02.436
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

01:46:03.915 --> 01:46:06.907
Actually, there is one thing.

01:46:07.619 --> 01:46:08.620
Whoo-hoo!

01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:09.848
Whoo-hoo!

01:46:09.921 --> 01:46:13.789
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', by golly!

01:46:18.296 --> 01:46:21.288
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

01:46:24.936 --> 01:46:27.234
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

01:46:30.375 --> 01:46:33.811
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

01:46:33.879 --> 01:46:34.868
to get tires.

01:46:34.946 --> 01:46:39.144
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

01:46:39.217 --> 01:46:44.416
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

01:46:44.489 --> 01:46:46.787
A real Ferrari!

01:46:46.858 --> 01:46:48.985
Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.

01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:52.518
This is the most glorious day
of my life.

01:46:53.832 --> 01:46:57.393
<i>Wow. [Italian]
Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.</i>

01:46:57.469 --> 01:46:59.801
<i>Mi dicono che siete fantastici.</i>

01:47:09.181 --> 01:47:13.447
- [Sighing]
- [Engine rewing]

01:47:13.819 --> 01:47:16.014
[Both chuckle]

01:47:16.087 --> 01:47:17.611
Just passin' through?

01:47:17.689 --> 01:47:19.987
Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.

01:47:20.058 --> 01:47:23.323
- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?

01:47:23.395 --> 01:47:27.161
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

01:47:27.232 --> 01:47:29.700
is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.

01:47:29.768 --> 01:47:32.601
Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.

01:47:32.671 --> 01:47:35.162
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:39.370
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,

01:47:39.444 --> 01:47:41.605
- blah, blah, blah.
- [Lightning chuckles]

01:47:42.013 --> 01:47:45.005
<i>McQueen and Sally
parked beneath the tree,</i>

01:47:45.083 --> 01:47:49.713
<i>K- i-s-s... uh... i- n-t!</i>

01:47:50.088 --> 01:47:52.056
Great timing, Mater!

01:47:52.123 --> 01:47:56.116
Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee!

01:47:56.194 --> 01:47:58.628
He's my best friend.
What're you gonna do?

01:47:58.697 --> 01:48:01.632
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:04.396
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?

01:48:04.469 --> 01:48:07.063
Hmm... Nah.

01:48:08.807 --> 01:48:11.042
Yeah! Ka-chow!

01:48:11.042 --> 01:48:14.034
<i>[John Mayer: Route 66]</i>

01:48:19.216 --> 01:48:21.309
[Yelling]

01:49:07.932 --> 01:49:10.526
[Sirens blaring]

01:49:16.107 --> 01:49:20.100
[Sniffing] Ah-choo!

01:49:22.913 --> 01:49:25.905
[Mater] All right, everybody
please keep together now.

01:49:25.983 --> 01:49:30.750
We is now entering the Doc Hudson
wing of the museum.

01:49:30.821 --> 01:49:33.790
Wow. Unbelievable.
That many wins in a single season.

01:49:33.858 --> 01:49:37.919
He's the real deal, Junior.
The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

01:49:37.995 --> 01:49:41.453
Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?

01:49:41.532 --> 01:49:45.332
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin'.

01:49:48.672 --> 01:49:51.835
- [Lightning] Whoo! Whoo!
- [Doc] Yeah!

01:49:51.909 --> 01:49:54.434
Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.

01:49:54.512 --> 01:49:57.572
Not today, old man.
I know all your tricks.

01:49:58.816 --> 01:50:00.443
[Growls]

01:50:01.852 --> 01:50:03.786
Doc! Doc!

01:50:04.088 --> 01:50:05.555
Whoo-ah!

01:50:06.023 --> 01:50:08.218
[Doc] Not all my tricks, rookie!

01:50:11.228 --> 01:50:13.219
[All grumble]

01:50:18.469 --> 01:50:20.994
[Cheering]

01:50:24.842 --> 01:50:28.334
Attention!
Kiss the pavement goodbye.

01:50:28.412 --> 01:50:31.848
When I'm finished, you'll have mud
in places you didn't know you had!

01:50:31.916 --> 01:50:35.750
- Yo, I've never been off-road!
- Well, that's gonna change right now!

01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:38.921
About face!
Drop and give me 20 miles!

01:50:38.989 --> 01:50:40.980
Go! Go!
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

01:50:41.058 --> 01:50:43.891
Man, now I got dirt in my rims!

01:50:46.530 --> 01:50:48.521
- [Pole hits metal]
- Huh? Look at this!

01:50:48.599 --> 01:50:50.760
It's my hood! It's my hood!

01:50:50.834 --> 01:50:53.928
I ain't seen this thing in 20 years!

01:50:54.538 --> 01:50:58.497
Well, it fits perfectly.
How do I look? Ah-choo!

01:51:04.181 --> 01:51:05.443
Oh, dang.

01:51:10.621 --> 01:51:14.148
<i>You are a toy car!</i>

01:51:14.225 --> 01:51:18.992
<i>You are a sad, strange little wagon
and you have my pity. Farewell.</i>

01:51:19.396 --> 01:51:22.126
<i>[Woody Car] Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, you loony!</i>

01:51:22.199 --> 01:51:25.896
<i>Hey, I hate to break up the road rally,
guys, but they're here!</i>

01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:28.336
<i>Birthday guests at three o'clock!</i>

01:51:28.405 --> 01:51:31.738
[Chuckling] Oh, man! Whoever does
the voice of that piggy truck,

01:51:31.809 --> 01:51:34.369
I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor!

01:51:34.912 --> 01:51:39.110
<i>We're banished, genius! Stuck here
in this wasteland without chains!</i>

01:51:39.183 --> 01:51:42.949
<i>But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble!
She needs our help!</i>

01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:47.286
<i>- You're still not listening! [gasping]
- Ah!</i>

01:51:47.358 --> 01:51:50.987
<i>Welcome to the Himalayas!
Snow cone?</i>

01:51:51.295 --> 01:51:54.992
Oh, that Abominable Snowplow
is quite the comic thespian!

01:51:55.532 --> 01:51:57.523
<i>Just get in there.
Go! Go, go, go!</i>

01:51:57.601 --> 01:51:59.000
<i>Circus cars?</i>

01:51:59.069 --> 01:52:01.537
<i>How can you be circus cars?</i>

01:52:01.605 --> 01:52:04.130
<i>These are the lousiest
circus cars in the world,</i>

01:52:04.208 --> 01:52:06.199
<i>and they're gonna make me rich!</i>

01:52:06.277 --> 01:52:07.403
Wait a minute here.

01:52:07.478 --> 01:52:09.946
They're just usin' the same actor
over and over.

01:52:10.014 --> 01:52:12.574
What kind of a cut-rate production
is this?

01:52:16.253 --> 01:52:19.450
<i>[Brad Paisley: Find Yourself]</i>

01:55:35.919 --> 01:55:38.353
[Minny moaning]

01:55:38.422 --> 01:55:43.086
Oh, for the love of Chrysler, can we
please ask someone for directions?

01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:47.392
No! There's an on-ramp close!
I know it! I can feel it!
