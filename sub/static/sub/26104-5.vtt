WEBVTT

00:03.354 --> 00:05.256
EZ: Previously on
Mayans M.C....

00:05.289 --> 00:08.992
-Shit.

00:09.025 --> 00:10.661
WOMAN: They're using the fence
as a shooting gallery.

00:10.694 --> 00:12.129
Alice Reed's?

00:12.163 --> 00:14.465
And her concerned
citizen coalition.

00:14.498 --> 00:16.333
OBISPO: Cops found scripts
near the body.

00:16.367 --> 00:17.401
That changes it from
target practice

00:17.434 --> 00:19.002
to drug running.

00:19.035 --> 00:20.904
MAN: He was in Stockton
when I was inside.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.473
Some sort of shot-caller.

00:22.506 --> 00:24.007
If Alice is running scripts,

00:24.040 --> 00:25.509
she's gonna need a buyer.

00:25.542 --> 00:27.944
OBISPO: This is a
military-style execution.

00:27.978 --> 00:29.313
It had to be Cole.

00:29.346 --> 00:30.447
He the guy buying the scripts

00:30.481 --> 00:32.115
you guys been picking off?

00:32.149 --> 00:33.950
If we don't find a buyer
for this heroin soon,

00:33.984 --> 00:35.786
Los Olvidados will lose ground.

00:37.354 --> 00:38.922
MAN: It's a tunnel!

00:38.955 --> 00:40.291
You need to help your son.

00:40.324 --> 00:42.426
Convince him to flip
Emily Thomas.

00:42.459 --> 00:45.028
Because if you don't,
everything your sons know

00:45.061 --> 00:47.664
and love about you...they're
gonna find out is a lie.

00:47.698 --> 00:51.101
You have to dismantle
the rebels' rhetoric.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.936
Here's where you can do it.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.938
-Mm.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.373
MAN: He came through.

00:56.407 --> 00:57.841
GALINDO: Who's the nun?

00:57.874 --> 00:59.776
That's one of
the local Dominicans.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.613
MAN:
Jane Esta muerta.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.515
WOMAN: Please don't
retaliate.

01:04.548 --> 01:06.317
GALINDO: Emily!

01:06.350 --> 01:08.719
Emily. Em?

01:45.055 --> 01:46.690
EZ: She okay?

01:46.723 --> 01:48.559
Yeah. Look, she got banged up
pretty bad, right?

01:48.592 --> 01:49.560
They're running tests.

01:49.593 --> 01:51.228
Hey, hey!
Stop, man.

01:51.262 --> 01:53.264
We're making sure
there's no internal injuries.

01:53.297 --> 01:54.731
What happened?

01:54.765 --> 01:56.367
The Festival in Santa Madre.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.201
Emily got caught up
in the chaos,

01:58.235 --> 01:59.403
got fucking trampled.

01:59.436 --> 02:02.439
Galindo brought her back here.

02:05.442 --> 02:08.044
-I got to see her, man.
Dude.

02:08.078 --> 02:09.680
El Jefe and his thugs,
man.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.682
They're camped out in there.

02:11.715 --> 02:14.618
Please, Franky.

02:14.651 --> 02:17.554
Shit.
Come on.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.271
Are you doing any better?

02:38.241 --> 02:40.344
More X-rays.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.292
FRANKY: Thank you, beautiful.

02:55.326 --> 02:57.728
Yeah, you owe me, Rogan.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.830
-Hi, Ezekiel.
-Hey, Rita.

02:59.863 --> 03:01.898
-Appreciate this.
-No worries.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.034
Just a couple of minutes.

03:18.782 --> 03:19.816
You in pain?

03:19.850 --> 03:22.319
Not much.

03:23.820 --> 03:25.922
This was a risk.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.991
I know.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.703
I needed to make sure
you were okay.

03:39.736 --> 03:42.639
I am.

03:45.476 --> 03:48.612
It was my fault.

03:48.645 --> 03:52.349
I pushed my way into the crowd.

03:52.383 --> 03:55.218
I don't remember much.

03:55.251 --> 03:57.521
It's all over the news.

03:57.554 --> 04:01.157
They said...

04:01.191 --> 04:03.727
the rebels murdered a nun.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.496
Yes.

04:05.529 --> 04:08.499
Just doesn't make much sense.

04:08.532 --> 04:10.066
What?

04:10.100 --> 04:12.503
Los Olvidados...

04:12.536 --> 04:14.738
attacking a community that
they're trying to save.

04:14.771 --> 04:16.673
They kidnapped my son.

04:16.707 --> 04:19.943
-I know.
-They're fucking dangerous.

04:24.615 --> 04:27.050
Yeah.

04:27.083 --> 04:30.821
They did it to hurt Miguel.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.089
The Galindo family has...

04:33.123 --> 04:36.860
given a lot of money
to the Catholic church.

04:39.396 --> 04:42.766
I didn't know.

04:42.799 --> 04:43.834
I'm sorry.

04:44.901 --> 04:47.070
Okay.

04:49.072 --> 04:52.042
Just let me know
if you need me.

04:52.075 --> 04:54.478
Or if you need anything.

04:58.081 --> 05:00.884
EZ.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.390
Have you heard anything
about my son?

05:08.925 --> 05:10.994
No.

05:15.331 --> 05:16.867
RITA: I'm sorry.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.069
I've got to get her down
to orthopedics.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.272
Sup, E?

05:56.306 --> 05:58.408
Shit went down in
Santa Madre last night.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.911
Cartel and the L.O.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.779
Shit.

06:02.813 --> 06:04.515
Okay, not on the cell.

06:04.548 --> 06:06.650
Meet you in the yard.

06:45.922 --> 06:52.863
*

06:52.896 --> 06:55.331
Pops?

06:55.365 --> 06:58.735
That you?

07:05.676 --> 07:07.210
You just climb through
the fucking window?

07:07.243 --> 07:09.312
What the fuck?

07:18.622 --> 07:25.629
*

07:26.229 --> 07:29.532
* Mother of exiles

07:29.566 --> 07:31.935
* The torch of hope

07:31.968 --> 07:34.204
* In the toss of the tempest

07:34.237 --> 07:37.073
* Threw us medicine's rope

07:37.107 --> 07:40.076
* But the brazen giant

07:40.110 --> 07:42.679
* Within limbs astride

07:42.713 --> 07:45.716
* Blocks the golden door

07:45.749 --> 07:48.451
* To the US of lies

07:48.484 --> 07:49.720
* Screaming

07:49.753 --> 07:53.289
* Damn your huddled masses

07:53.323 --> 07:56.693
* Scrub our floors

07:56.727 --> 07:59.295
* Cut our grasses

07:59.329 --> 08:01.865
* I am a wolf

08:01.898 --> 08:04.735
* A wild cur

08:04.768 --> 08:07.904
* Cut from the pack

08:07.938 --> 08:10.641
* With blood on my fur

08:10.674 --> 08:13.243
* Every howl

08:13.276 --> 08:16.079
* Marks the dead

08:16.112 --> 08:19.650
* 'Cause a beaten dog

08:19.683 --> 08:21.251
*

08:21.284 --> 08:23.419
* Never forgets

08:23.453 --> 08:26.657
*

08:26.690 --> 08:28.759
* Never forgets

08:28.792 --> 08:35.799
*

08:43.539 --> 08:47.243
This was you?

08:47.277 --> 08:48.945
And all the bodies?

08:48.979 --> 08:51.114
Yeah.

08:51.147 --> 08:53.784
We were gonna leave her
at the house, but...

08:53.817 --> 08:55.585
seemed a little bit
over the top.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.488
You think?

08:58.521 --> 09:00.791
Who the fuck are you guys?

09:00.824 --> 09:02.659
Lower the weapon.

09:02.693 --> 09:06.496
And sit down.

09:12.535 --> 09:14.871
So...

09:14.905 --> 09:17.373
What do you know about me?

09:17.407 --> 09:19.676
Angel Ignacio Reyes?

09:19.710 --> 09:22.445
Besides your flair
for the dramatic,

09:22.478 --> 09:26.783
not fucking much.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.952
Got from Dennis you
were buying the scripts.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.353
Where is Dennis?

09:30.386 --> 09:31.788
With Mama.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.156
Or...

09:33.189 --> 09:37.627
what's left of her.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.295
Why'd you waste them all?

09:39.329 --> 09:41.798
They did the R.O.E.

09:41.832 --> 09:45.736
Then they unraveled.
Became a liability.

09:45.769 --> 09:48.638
Your club got something
to move?

09:48.671 --> 09:51.775
-Not the club.
-So it's your own deal.

09:55.111 --> 09:57.413
Stop wasting my time.

09:57.447 --> 09:59.315
Heroin.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.751
Six keys.

10:00.784 --> 10:03.253
97% pure guero.

10:03.286 --> 10:04.320
30 per.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.090
You got them here?

10:07.123 --> 10:09.659
You ex

10:09.692 --> 10:10.727
Blackwater?

10:10.761 --> 10:12.829
Close enough.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.866
We are...

10:15.899 --> 10:17.433
unfuckable.

10:17.467 --> 10:19.435
Yeah.

10:19.469 --> 10:21.071
I get that.

10:25.575 --> 10:27.543
The H is in Santa Madre.

10:27.577 --> 10:31.047
I can get it here in two hours.

10:31.081 --> 10:33.116
You move your shit
through tunnels.

10:33.149 --> 10:34.818
We do.

10:37.153 --> 10:39.923
We might be able
to make this work.

10:58.474 --> 11:00.576
No.

11:49.692 --> 11:50.894
Si.

11:54.530 --> 11:55.665
Well...

12:08.811 --> 12:10.947
MAN:

12:10.981 --> 12:12.515
Sorry to interrupt.

12:12.548 --> 12:14.184
Thought you should know.

12:14.217 --> 12:16.119
Just saw the prospect

12:16.152 --> 12:18.354
walk out of an exam room.

12:20.590 --> 12:23.659
A second later, a nurse
wheeled Emily out.

12:30.867 --> 12:35.305
Well...

12:35.338 --> 12:40.176
it's good to know my wife
is talking to someone.

12:57.260 --> 12:59.896
-You're up early.
-Yeah.

13:07.570 --> 13:11.274
Felipe: You want something?
-Nah, I'm good.

13:11.307 --> 13:13.409
Felipe: Not sure I believe
that.

13:15.245 --> 13:18.281
Hear about that thing
in Santa Madre?

13:18.314 --> 13:21.284
The church?

13:22.485 --> 13:26.189
-No.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.859
But Emily was there.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.295
She got roughed up pretty bad.

13:32.328 --> 13:33.696
Just went to see her.

13:33.729 --> 13:37.033
Jesus.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.635
She's in trouble, Pop.

13:39.669 --> 13:41.804
I know it.

13:43.673 --> 13:46.609
There's not much
you can do about that.

13:51.948 --> 13:55.251
Her kid being taken--

13:55.285 --> 13:59.122
the feds see it
as an opportunity.

13:59.155 --> 14:01.424
Jimenez wants me
to turn her.

14:01.457 --> 14:04.260
Bring her in.

14:06.529 --> 14:09.232
The deal I signed off on...

14:09.265 --> 14:11.434
everything's upside down.

14:11.467 --> 14:14.637
I never wanted any of this
to touch her.

14:14.670 --> 14:17.640
But now...

14:17.673 --> 14:19.875
it might be the only thing
that could keep her safe.

14:21.544 --> 14:24.447
I don't know what to do.

14:26.382 --> 14:29.919
You'd have to tell her
everything, son.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.788
It's too big a risk.

14:32.822 --> 14:36.292
She's been a part of Galindo's
world for many years.

14:36.326 --> 14:39.829
I'm not saying she's become
like him, but...

14:39.862 --> 14:44.367
she's not the same girl
you knew eight years ago.

14:48.504 --> 14:51.374
Yeah.

14:54.410 --> 14:58.348
*

15:21.704 --> 15:23.139
Follow us.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.674
Why would I do that?

15:24.707 --> 15:26.976
'Cause you're smart.

15:29.011 --> 15:36.018
*

16:04.380 --> 16:06.449
This is fucked up.

16:06.482 --> 16:08.618
They're really smart.

16:08.651 --> 16:10.620
COCO: We got through
to Pablo.

16:10.653 --> 16:12.522
Adelita's in the city
letting everybody know

16:12.555 --> 16:15.091
it was Galindo who fucked up
the church.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.427
GILLY: Rebels are moving
camp again.

16:17.460 --> 16:20.696
I got some news that might
take the sting out of this.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.765
Cole paid me a visit.

16:22.798 --> 16:24.100
When?

16:24.134 --> 16:26.302
ANGEL: This morning.
At my house.

16:26.336 --> 16:28.238
Brought Alice with him.

16:28.271 --> 16:29.905
Or at least her head.

16:29.939 --> 16:32.575
-Very serious.

16:32.608 --> 16:34.277
ANGEL: You were right.

16:34.310 --> 16:36.746
They're ex-military.
Marines, Special Forces.

16:36.779 --> 16:38.581
Now they're pretty much

16:38.614 --> 16:40.550
venture mercenaries.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.418
They got contacts
all over the world.

16:42.452 --> 16:44.587
Hook up buyers and sellers,
take a percentage.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.622
That's what he did
with Alice's scripts.

16:46.656 --> 16:48.558
Until the crew got sloppy.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.560
We sure we want to be
in business with these guys?

16:50.593 --> 16:52.795
We already are.

16:52.828 --> 16:54.830
Look, Cole can move
all six keys.

16:54.864 --> 16:57.267
All we gotta do is earn
a little trust.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.169
-Do him a favor.

16:59.202 --> 17:00.670
How many heads he need?

17:00.703 --> 17:02.138
Just one.

17:02.172 --> 17:05.007
Needs to smuggle a friend
into the States.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.576
An Afghani national.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.077
No-fly list.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.245
Yeah.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.780
Who the hell is this guy?

17:10.813 --> 17:12.782
He's one of the translators.

17:12.815 --> 17:14.116
GILLY: Nuh-uh.

17:14.150 --> 17:15.451
Dude, anybody eating curry

17:15.485 --> 17:17.287
is on the no-fly list.

17:17.320 --> 17:19.189
He's hiding out near
the Sonora border.

17:19.222 --> 17:21.957
We pick him up,
blindfold him,

17:21.991 --> 17:23.793
and bring him home
through the underground.

17:23.826 --> 17:24.960
That's a lot of trust.

17:24.994 --> 17:27.096
We got no choice.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.664
This...

17:28.698 --> 17:30.933
this could be a clusterfuck
for Los Olvidados.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.968
Adelita needs that cash.

17:33.002 --> 17:36.439
-I'll go with.
-No. You go back to the ranch.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.940
Cover up that hole better.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.376
See where that tunnel leads.

17:47.883 --> 17:50.620
Got a few hours left
in the yard.

17:50.653 --> 17:53.556
Just finish up.
Business as usual.

17:53.589 --> 17:54.990
I'll take the prospect
with me.

17:55.024 --> 17:56.226
Yeah.

17:56.259 --> 17:59.529
If he ever fucking
gets here.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.138
-Good to see you.

18:12.107 --> 18:19.114
*

18:47.209 --> 18:48.511
GALINDO: I apologize

18:48.544 --> 18:52.047
for the suddenness
of my request.

18:52.081 --> 18:53.716
It must be important.

18:53.749 --> 18:56.118
GALINDO: It is, for both of us.

18:56.151 --> 19:00.189
And the person
we have in common.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.957
The hospital.

19:01.991 --> 19:05.461
I'm assuming you still
have some...

19:05.495 --> 19:08.931
nostalgic feelings for Emily?

19:08.964 --> 19:10.866
We have history.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.068
I know you're aware.

19:16.339 --> 19:19.709
I was worried about her.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.777
Meant no disrespect.

19:25.348 --> 19:27.950
There a reason we're chatting
in no

19:34.490 --> 19:37.727
It's pretty desolate,
isn't it?

19:37.760 --> 19:40.396
But once the zoning
gets ironed out,

19:40.430 --> 19:44.334
I'm gonna buy this lot
and all adjacent property.

19:44.367 --> 19:47.570
Over 250 acres.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.573
I have commitments from three
big agro companies,

19:50.606 --> 19:52.908
both here and in Sonora

19:52.942 --> 19:56.011
to base operations
out of Santo Padre.

19:56.045 --> 19:58.113
And with that

19:58.147 --> 20:01.784
comes housing, retail,
schools...

20:01.817 --> 20:04.687
Gives this economy
a heartbeat again.

20:04.720 --> 20:09.592
Puts us on the map.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.994
Michael Corleone.

20:15.398 --> 20:18.000
Capitalism.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.169
Wash the blood
off the family money.

20:21.704 --> 20:24.106
Right.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.776
Who are you in that movie?

20:26.809 --> 20:29.612
I'm not sure.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.947
As long as it's not Fredo.

20:43.493 --> 20:44.794
Can't be a large
percentage

20:44.827 --> 20:47.062
of outlaw bikers
who speak Latin.

20:47.096 --> 20:48.831
Or cartel leaders

20:48.864 --> 20:52.435
saving a migrant town
from extinction.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.409
No, life takes you in so many

20:59.442 --> 21:02.612
unexpected directions.

21:09.552 --> 21:12.087
I'm guessing this isn't
about you and me

21:12.121 --> 21:13.989
bonding over dead languages.

21:14.023 --> 21:18.327
No, it's not.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.997
Just stay away
from my wife, Ezekiel.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.566
Now, with everything
that's happened,

21:23.599 --> 21:27.570
your presence only
complicates things more.

21:29.405 --> 21:31.240
That understood?

21:35.077 --> 21:36.746
Good.

21:40.249 --> 21:43.419
Well, because next time...

21:43.453 --> 21:46.889
it won't be a
polite conversation.

21:56.165 --> 21:57.733
-Mayor.
-Miguel.

21:57.767 --> 21:59.268
Glad you
could make it out.

22:10.446 --> 22:11.947
What's going on, brother?

22:11.981 --> 22:14.550
Thought you were heading out
this morning.

22:14.584 --> 22:16.051
I am.

22:16.085 --> 22:19.589
I talked to Devante Cano
this morning.

22:19.622 --> 22:21.491
He gave me this.

22:21.524 --> 22:23.493
Leader of Los Olvidados.

22:23.526 --> 22:26.962
-It is a woman.
-She looks like a kid.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.167
We'll keep our eyes open.

22:32.201 --> 22:34.236
Yeah, for now,
only the eyes in this room,

22:34.269 --> 22:36.939
until you're convinced
your charter is Judas-free.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.243
Yeah.

22:41.276 --> 22:44.146
Okay.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.316
ANGEL: Who saw you at the
hospital?

22:47.349 --> 22:48.784
EZ: I don't know.

22:48.818 --> 22:51.086
ANGEL: It was stupid,
little brother.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.623
You got to stay
away from Emily.

22:53.656 --> 22:56.258
You can't stir shit up
with Galindo.

22:56.291 --> 22:57.459
Not now.

22:57.493 --> 22:59.629
I'm sorry.
She just...

22:59.662 --> 23:01.296
She triggers shit, man.

23:01.330 --> 23:02.865
It's like I'm acting on it

23:02.898 --> 23:05.601
before I even know what
the fuck I'm doing.

23:05.635 --> 23:07.737
ANGEL: Chicks.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.776
Look, I know...

23:13.809 --> 23:16.512
keeping this kid thing
from her breaks you in half.

23:16.546 --> 23:19.782
I get it.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.017
But there was nothing
that you could have done

23:22.051 --> 23:23.786
to stop what happened
at the church.

23:23.819 --> 23:27.056
I could tell her the truth.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.492
Yeah, tell her you're
in bed with the crew

23:30.526 --> 23:32.294
that kidnapped her son.

23:32.327 --> 23:35.931
That'll win her back.

23:39.702 --> 23:41.971
We lock this shit down today,

23:42.004 --> 23:45.340
we're one step closer
to pushing out Galindo.

23:45.374 --> 23:47.309
The club wins.

23:47.342 --> 23:48.644
We win.

23:48.678 --> 23:50.479
Then it's all just

23:50.512 --> 23:52.481
putas...

23:52.514 --> 23:54.083
and plata.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.219
Okay, Pitbull.

23:57.252 --> 23:59.188
ANGEL: Mm-hmm.

25:28.510 --> 25:30.279
Gracias.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.615
EZ: Thought the rebels
get by on...

26:06.648 --> 26:09.484
the shit they borrow and steal.

26:09.518 --> 26:12.321
Why does Adelita need
all this cash?

26:12.354 --> 26:13.655
Next phase of the plan.

26:13.689 --> 26:16.058
Which is?

26:16.091 --> 26:18.994
I just get a little piece
at a time.

26:23.833 --> 26:27.336
When she was a kid...

26:27.369 --> 26:31.640
she saw her whole family
get hacked to pieces.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.743
She's got some trust issues.

26:33.776 --> 26:35.510
Yeah.

26:35.544 --> 26:38.180
Chicks, man.

26:52.094 --> 26:55.865
EZ: Should be at
the end of the block.

26:59.201 --> 27:06.041
*

27:06.075 --> 27:07.877
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
Stop here.

27:07.910 --> 27:10.512
Stop here.
This has gotta be it.

27:14.383 --> 27:21.390
*

27:29.098 --> 27:32.701
*

27:32.734 --> 27:35.270
EZ: Red door.

27:38.507 --> 27:40.475
Whose place is this, anyway?

27:40.509 --> 27:41.911
I didn't ask.

27:52.321 --> 27:54.256
-Arriba los manos!

27:54.289 --> 27:55.490
Adentro!

27:58.493 --> 28:01.096
Shit.

28:02.631 --> 28:04.399
Americans.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.068
Fantastic.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.703
What the fuck is this?

28:13.943 --> 28:15.744
In this country,

28:15.777 --> 28:18.247
you respect the badge.

28:25.487 --> 28:27.456
My wife was supposed to
fly back to Kabul

28:27.489 --> 28:29.124
two days ago.

28:29.158 --> 28:32.194
But there were complications
with the pregnancy.

28:32.227 --> 28:33.795
The couple that owns the house,

28:33.829 --> 28:35.931
I asked them
to call a doctor.

28:35.965 --> 28:39.601
The doctor was very,
very suspicious.

28:39.634 --> 28:41.603
They called
the Policia Estatal.

28:41.636 --> 28:43.505
WOMAN: Yes.
-Their commander, he--

28:43.538 --> 28:46.008
he threatened to kill
all of us.

28:49.078 --> 28:52.948
*

28:52.982 --> 28:54.783
You are brothers.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.051
I like that.

28:56.085 --> 28:58.287
Family.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.489
We are like family too.

29:00.522 --> 29:02.324
This woman needs
food and water.

29:02.357 --> 29:04.526
Or she's gonna lose her family.

29:10.399 --> 29:12.167
Your friend there--

29:12.201 --> 29:13.168
the terrorist.

29:13.202 --> 29:16.505
He's not our friend.

29:16.538 --> 29:18.507
And he's not
a fucking terrorist.

29:20.109 --> 29:22.611
We were just sent
to bring him back.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.748
So now you go to the people
that sent you.

29:26.781 --> 29:28.150
Tell them

29:28.183 --> 29:30.819
if they want this
not-a-terrorist

29:30.852 --> 29:33.655
and his pregnant
not-a-terrorist wife,

29:33.688 --> 29:36.091
it will cost them...

29:36.125 --> 29:37.893
$100,000...

29:37.927 --> 29:38.994
American.

29:39.028 --> 29:40.262
Are you fucking kidding me?

29:40.295 --> 29:42.932
No, rude brown Yankee.

29:42.965 --> 29:46.035
I do not kid.

29:46.068 --> 29:48.737
Thank you.

29:50.305 --> 29:52.874
If we send this one,

29:52.908 --> 29:54.776
he may never come back.

29:58.780 --> 30:02.351
This one has heart.

30:02.384 --> 30:05.620
He will come back
for his brother.

30:08.157 --> 30:10.459
What the fuck does that mean?

30:12.461 --> 30:14.396
You have till morning.

30:14.429 --> 30:16.065
You're not back with the money,

30:16.098 --> 30:19.801
by the time I finish
my café de olla,

30:19.834 --> 30:22.271
I will kill all of them.

30:25.807 --> 30:28.110
Hurry up, Ezekiel.

30:42.291 --> 30:43.558
Yeah.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.394
Shit went south
with the pickup.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.096
State police were
waiting for us.

30:47.129 --> 30:49.631
Holding the Afghani
and Angel hostage.

30:49.664 --> 30:52.001
-They want 100,000 by morning.
-Jesus.

30:52.034 --> 30:53.102
Do you know how
to reach Cole?

30:53.135 --> 30:54.736
Only Angel's got the number.

30:54.769 --> 30:56.071
Fuck.

30:56.105 --> 30:58.640
I can put together
some of the cash.

30:58.673 --> 31:00.642
I just don't know where
I'm gonna get the rest.

31:00.675 --> 31:02.077
Where you at now?

31:02.111 --> 31:04.779
About, uh, a half hour
from the border.

31:04.813 --> 31:06.281
Stay there.
I got to make a call.

31:06.315 --> 31:08.317
I'll tell you where to meet.

31:15.824 --> 31:18.760
CHUCKY: Everything okay, Coco?

31:18.793 --> 31:20.862
COCO: Handle this shit,
Chucky.

31:36.178 --> 31:38.613
Where's Coco off to
in such a hurry?

31:38.647 --> 31:41.016
I don't know, Obispo.

31:41.050 --> 31:43.618
He got a call, seemed upset.

31:43.652 --> 31:46.455
I'm worried about
our Johnny "Coco" Cruz.

31:46.488 --> 31:48.157
Why's that?

31:48.190 --> 31:50.625
I think he's going through
a crisis.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.994
I saw him yesterday
at the Olympic Diner.

31:53.028 --> 31:56.631
He was arguing with a woman,
and he chased after her.

31:56.665 --> 31:58.067
OBISPO: What woman?

31:58.100 --> 32:00.502
Young. Latina.

32:07.542 --> 32:09.311
Was this her?

32:09.344 --> 32:11.180
I don't know. Maybe.

32:11.213 --> 32:12.814
I was just driving by

32:12.847 --> 32:14.149
and singing.

32:14.183 --> 32:15.750
I like to sing when I drive.

32:15.784 --> 32:17.586
No particular genre.

32:17.619 --> 32:19.321
TAZA: What time yesterday,
Manos?

32:19.354 --> 32:21.090
Afternoon.

32:21.123 --> 32:24.226
I was picking up the copper
contracts at El Centro.

32:24.259 --> 32:26.895
All right. Thanks.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.200
Yesterday afternoon.

32:31.233 --> 32:33.602
But he said he was
watching Alice's place.

32:34.803 --> 32:36.571
See where he's going.

32:47.582 --> 32:48.783
We all good, Primo?

32:48.817 --> 32:51.052
Yeah, yeah.
Just yard stuff.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.190
I'll stay in touch
with Devante.

32:55.224 --> 32:57.659
Try to keep Galindo's
head in the game.

32:58.893 --> 33:00.629
Let me know what
happens here, huh?

33:00.662 --> 33:02.063
I will.

33:03.798 --> 33:06.135
Safe trip.

33:19.614 --> 33:21.916
Fucking hate this.

33:23.785 --> 33:30.225
*

33:30.259 --> 33:31.660
FELIPE: Beer.

33:34.429 --> 33:37.031
The hell you doing here?

33:38.867 --> 33:40.869
Passing through.

33:42.837 --> 33:44.573
You don't pass through
El Centro.

33:44.606 --> 33:46.975
You drive around.

33:49.444 --> 33:54.649
The mill said you'd be here,
having lunch.

33:54.683 --> 33:56.818
Yeah.

34:00.489 --> 34:03.024
What do you want, Felipe?

34:04.693 --> 34:07.562
Saw your boy yesterday.

34:10.965 --> 34:13.602
Made me think

34:13.635 --> 34:15.904
maybe we should catch up.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.808
Got nothing to say
about my boy.

34:21.343 --> 34:24.213
FELIPE: Didn't tell me
about your grandkids.

34:27.249 --> 34:34.256
*

35:12.026 --> 35:13.495
COCO: It was a simple pick-up.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.397
Just take the guy
through the tunnels.

35:15.430 --> 35:18.333
The state police, they can be
more brutal than the cartel.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.201
Even if you were to
find the money,

35:20.235 --> 35:23.772
they'd just take it
and still kill everyone.

35:23.805 --> 35:26.708
If we don't try something,
that'll happen for sure.

35:26.741 --> 35:28.877
This buyer is for real.

35:28.910 --> 35:30.545
We got to make this deal work.

35:30.579 --> 35:33.181
Fuck the buyer.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.350
Angel is there because of you.

35:35.384 --> 35:37.686
He needs your help.

35:37.719 --> 35:40.154
What do we have to do
to get that?

35:41.956 --> 35:43.892
Do I slit my throat?

35:46.961 --> 35:49.063
Throw acid on his face?

35:50.399 --> 35:52.934
Don't you dare
to compare this.

35:52.967 --> 35:55.904
He's my fucking brother.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.408
I'll do whatever I have to do.

35:59.441 --> 36:01.776
The heroin.

36:01.810 --> 36:03.412
We can use that instead
of the cash, I mean,

36:03.445 --> 36:05.246
they're dirty cops, right?

36:05.280 --> 36:07.949
They could unload it
on the streets.

36:09.618 --> 36:14.188
I know this heroin gets you
the money you need.

36:15.924 --> 36:19.027
But you need Angel more.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.365
Please.

36:42.851 --> 36:44.152
Go find Pablo.

38:16.578 --> 38:19.881
Oh...shit.

38:23.117 --> 38:28.790
*

38:28.823 --> 38:32.193
-Nah.

38:32.226 --> 38:33.762
Hey, Gilly.

38:36.565 --> 38:38.867
-Not much.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.369
Didn't know you were
gonna be here.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.071
Just come and get the cripple.

38:43.104 --> 38:44.739
You crawl here?

38:44.773 --> 38:46.374
GILLY: Nah.

38:46.407 --> 38:47.742
I'm gonna clean up real quick.

38:47.776 --> 38:50.445
Maybe get me a quick blowy.

38:51.446 --> 38:53.615
Where's his ride?

38:54.983 --> 38:56.585
I don't know.

38:59.287 --> 39:01.923
I hear you're
being discharged.

39:01.956 --> 39:03.157
Yes.

39:06.595 --> 39:09.263
Discharged usually requires
opening the door.

39:11.165 --> 39:12.801
One minute.

39:12.834 --> 39:14.503
Please.

39:16.605 --> 39:18.740
Do you know the...

39:18.773 --> 39:21.576
Mexican fairytale,
The Forbidden Room?

39:21.610 --> 39:23.411
La Camara Prohibida?

39:23.444 --> 39:24.746
Really?

39:24.779 --> 39:27.949
You want to share
a fairytale?

39:27.982 --> 39:30.318
I'm not the enemy, Emily.

39:30.351 --> 39:33.622
I think sometimes you see me
as the man behind the curtain,

39:33.655 --> 39:35.123
pulling strings.

39:35.156 --> 39:36.791
I assure you

39:36.825 --> 39:38.627
every decision I make,

39:38.660 --> 39:40.962
every word of advice I give,

39:40.995 --> 39:43.164
is in the best interest
of this family.

39:46.067 --> 39:48.970
Your input about the rebels...

39:50.071 --> 39:51.439
Was very smart.

39:51.472 --> 39:54.475
And very effective.

39:59.981 --> 40:02.951
But you have to understand

40:02.984 --> 40:05.954
that if you want to be
a part of that,

40:05.987 --> 40:09.457
you can't pick and choose
what you like.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.492
You accept all of it

40:11.526 --> 40:15.229
or you walk away from it.

40:15.263 --> 40:17.666
Anything else

40:17.699 --> 40:20.535
will undermine what
Miguel has to do.

40:23.204 --> 40:26.340
I know my husband
can be ruthless.

40:26.374 --> 40:31.345
I saw that side of him
before we were married.

40:31.379 --> 40:33.648
But he has a brilliant mind

40:33.682 --> 40:36.117
and a compassionate
heart, and...

40:37.852 --> 40:40.488
Those traits have always
balanced out

40:40.521 --> 40:43.491
the familial instincts.

40:43.524 --> 40:46.160
Kept him even.
He knew who he was

40:46.194 --> 40:48.329
in both worlds.

40:48.362 --> 40:50.198
And that...

40:50.231 --> 40:53.367
-Yes.

40:53.401 --> 40:55.704
Since Cristobal was taken...

40:57.371 --> 40:59.708
That balance is gone.

41:00.642 --> 41:04.378
Miguel swings between
volatile rage,

41:04.412 --> 41:06.948
wanting revenge, and then...

41:08.382 --> 41:10.018
He crashes.

41:10.051 --> 41:13.855
Becomes inconsolable.

41:13.888 --> 41:17.258
He may put on that rey del
cartel mask for his men,

41:17.291 --> 41:18.927
but I see what's happening.

41:18.960 --> 41:22.463
His markers have all
been moved.

41:22.496 --> 41:23.865
So right now it doesn't matter

41:23.898 --> 41:27.401
if I accept or walk away
from anything.

41:27.435 --> 41:30.739
My husband is lost, Devante.

41:34.676 --> 41:36.711
And I don't know what to say.

41:36.745 --> 41:39.413
Or how to help.

41:41.616 --> 41:43.652
You're bold, Emily.

41:44.953 --> 41:46.755
Truth is,

41:46.788 --> 41:50.058
sometimes a little too
bold for my comfort.

41:50.091 --> 41:52.894
But that's my problem.

41:52.927 --> 41:56.230
Miguel loves that side of you.

41:56.264 --> 41:59.968
And I understand why.

42:00.001 --> 42:01.903
I know how...

42:01.936 --> 42:04.706
brutally painful this
has been for you.

42:07.341 --> 42:09.778
But you need to talk to him.

42:09.811 --> 42:12.613
Tell him everything.

42:12.647 --> 42:15.616
Secrets kill love.

42:15.650 --> 42:17.786
Trust me on that.

42:20.521 --> 42:24.358
John only had it half-right.

42:24.392 --> 42:27.061
The truth doesn't set you free.

42:28.496 --> 42:31.700
The ugly truth does.

42:34.402 --> 42:36.404
Miguel...

42:38.639 --> 42:42.777
Cannot be the man
he needs to be

42:42.811 --> 42:44.578
without you.

42:49.317 --> 42:53.087
Let us know when you're
ready to leave.

44:18.472 --> 44:21.509
*

44:35.256 --> 44:36.424
Are these your friend's?

44:36.457 --> 44:38.059
No. They're mine.

44:38.092 --> 44:39.493
And this?

44:39.527 --> 44:41.896
-Your payment.
-It's almost 100% pure.

44:41.930 --> 44:43.932
Could step on it
a half-dozen times.

44:43.965 --> 44:45.499
It's over 100K on the street.

44:45.533 --> 44:47.401
Well, if you are drug lords,

44:47.435 --> 44:48.402
then where's the cash?

44:48.436 --> 44:49.670
We found the heroin.

45:24.305 --> 45:25.840
Yeah?

45:25.874 --> 45:27.876
Hey, I followed Coco
to the warehouse.

45:27.909 --> 45:29.610
I walked the tunnels.

45:29.643 --> 45:31.946
I'm not sure which
exit he took.

45:31.980 --> 45:33.147
You want me to wait here?

45:33.181 --> 45:34.482
Uh, no.

45:34.515 --> 45:37.218
MAN: Hey...

45:37.251 --> 45:39.687
Come on back.

45:42.991 --> 45:45.259
-Welcome home, Creep.
-Thanks, brother.

45:47.328 --> 45:49.497
Where's Coco?

45:49.530 --> 45:51.933
No idea.

46:17.525 --> 46:19.360
Their heroin is pure.

46:19.393 --> 46:21.029
I will accept it as payment.

46:24.432 --> 46:27.001
However, you,

46:27.035 --> 46:29.303
I take with me.

46:30.104 --> 46:31.872
Fuck that.
You got paid.

46:31.906 --> 46:33.041
Oof!

46:33.074 --> 46:35.776
MAN: Hey, hey!
-Stop it!

46:37.645 --> 46:40.081
If you don't keep your word,

46:40.114 --> 46:43.051
you'll suffer the consequences.

46:57.165 --> 46:59.100
We'll show you
what suffering is.

48:19.180 --> 48:22.950
I'm sorry.
This went bad.

48:22.983 --> 48:25.053
Thank you.

48:27.321 --> 48:29.857
Don't do this again.

48:33.194 --> 48:34.828
She doesn't want me
to do that again.

48:34.862 --> 48:37.165
So don't.

48:46.274 --> 48:48.842
We made it, man.

48:48.876 --> 48:50.811
As-salamu alaykum.

48:50.844 --> 48:52.946
And look at you.

48:55.015 --> 48:57.118
Get them to the truck.

48:58.086 --> 48:59.520
WOMAN: Thank you.
MAN: Thank you.

48:59.553 --> 49:00.754
Thank you so much.

49:00.788 --> 49:03.091
WOMAN: So much.
MAN: You saved us.

49:06.026 --> 49:07.828
Damn.

49:07.861 --> 49:10.498
We didn't know any of that shit
went down in Sonora.

49:10.531 --> 49:12.533
I know.

49:12.566 --> 49:14.368
Glad it all worked out.

49:14.402 --> 49:16.170
I can get you 50K.

49:16.204 --> 49:17.838
For each of those keys.

49:17.871 --> 49:20.708
That's...that's great,
man. Thank you.

49:20.741 --> 49:22.876
You treat us good,

49:22.910 --> 49:25.045
we'll treat you better.

49:25.079 --> 49:27.248
You treat us bad...

49:29.450 --> 49:30.951
We'll treat you worse.

49:33.387 --> 49:35.723
I'll be in touch.

49:40.728 --> 49:42.296
You think I can get
my dick in her mouth?

49:42.330 --> 49:44.632
Jesus.

49:49.069 --> 49:51.071
You really need help, man.

49:54.575 --> 49:55.809
Come on, like you guys

49:55.843 --> 49:58.412
weren't thinking
the same thing?

50:33.647 --> 50:40.654
*

50:40.821 --> 50:42.323
You in need of high-end
scrap, mayor?

50:45.493 --> 50:47.795
What is it?

50:47.828 --> 50:50.798
Had a meeting
with Galindo today.

50:50.831 --> 50:53.100
The border property.

50:53.133 --> 50:56.770
He said that if I didn't amend
the zoning restrictions,

50:56.804 --> 50:57.971
fudge the PA shit...

50:58.005 --> 50:59.373
He threatened to hurt you?

50:59.407 --> 51:00.374
No, he said he would
take the project

51:00.408 --> 51:02.443
out of the county.

51:02.476 --> 51:04.845
Santo Padre would get nothing.

51:04.878 --> 51:07.147
All the shit that I've done,

51:07.181 --> 51:10.384
all the rules that I bent
to make this happen...

51:17.525 --> 51:19.893
Give it a minute.

51:19.927 --> 51:21.662
Galindo's dealing with
a family thing.

51:21.695 --> 51:23.664
He might be overreacting
to shit.

51:23.697 --> 51:25.966
What the fuck does
that mean?

51:25.999 --> 51:28.669
His son was kidnapped
last week.

51:28.702 --> 51:30.671
The rebels.

51:30.704 --> 51:32.340
He's unglued.

51:32.373 --> 51:35.142
Jesus Christ.

51:35.175 --> 51:37.845
Sorry you keep catching
the heat of this.

51:39.847 --> 51:45.018
What happens if
Galindo's kid is...

51:45.052 --> 51:47.154
Shit.

51:47.187 --> 51:49.156
If this guy comes unhinged...

51:49.189 --> 51:51.359
I know.

51:53.927 --> 51:56.029
Hey.

51:58.966 --> 52:01.068
I'll let you know
how it plays out.

52:10.578 --> 52:12.212
Hey.

52:12.246 --> 52:13.981
I got you, Antonia.

52:45.946 --> 52:48.782
-Jefe.

52:48.816 --> 52:50.984
Ah, just bullshitting.
Stuff at the house.

52:51.018 --> 52:52.586
You left in a hurry, Coco.

52:52.620 --> 52:55.789
Yeah, my girl, her pipe
broke at her place.

52:55.823 --> 52:57.257
Had to bail her out.

52:57.291 --> 52:58.726
She can't swim?

53:11.772 --> 53:13.841
Keep Coco close.

53:15.108 --> 53:17.110
Angel, too.

53:26.487 --> 53:27.788
Hey.

53:27.821 --> 53:30.358
I'm sorry.

53:30.391 --> 53:33.694
The guy with the freaky hands
let me in.

53:33.727 --> 53:36.196
I--I just thought it best
I wait inside.

53:37.465 --> 53:39.733
Yeah, of course.

53:41.835 --> 53:43.604
How'd you get here?

53:43.637 --> 53:45.439
Franky.

53:45.473 --> 53:48.909
He's waiting for me
around the corner.

53:57.150 --> 53:58.285
I know I shouldn't...

53:58.318 --> 54:00.688
be here, I...

54:03.824 --> 54:06.760
-No, it's...
-I just...

54:09.997 --> 54:12.866
I can't shake this
feeling, EZ.

54:14.868 --> 54:16.370
What's going on?

54:22.109 --> 54:26.714
When you went inside...

54:26.747 --> 54:28.849
shut me out...

54:32.052 --> 54:34.021
The abortion...

54:38.892 --> 54:41.529
I did it out of spite.

54:42.930 --> 54:45.232
No, Em.

54:45.265 --> 54:47.568
Yeah, I was an idiot.

54:49.703 --> 54:51.204
You had to take care
of yourself.

54:51.238 --> 54:53.707
I did it to hurt you.

54:53.741 --> 54:57.144
I used it to hurt you.

54:59.580 --> 55:01.682
Cristobal being taken,

55:01.715 --> 55:03.684
I can't help but feel...

55:03.717 --> 55:06.186
it is my fault,
it is my punishment

55:06.219 --> 55:07.955
for what I did to you.
For what I--

55:09.657 --> 55:11.559
It's not your fault.

55:11.592 --> 55:14.161
God, it's not on you.

55:16.564 --> 55:20.701
I don't know who I am
anymore, I don't...

55:20.734 --> 55:22.836
I'm here.

55:28.175 --> 55:30.177
Em...

55:32.580 --> 55:34.748
I have to tell you something.

55:38.586 --> 55:40.120
Shit.

55:42.155 --> 55:43.524
Sorry.

55:46.093 --> 55:48.596
Franky's waiting,
so I should--

55:48.629 --> 55:49.797
I should go.

55:52.966 --> 55:54.301
Emily--

56:00.140 --> 56:01.775
-She came to me.

56:01.809 --> 56:03.844
-Even worse.
-She's all fucked up, Angel.

56:03.877 --> 56:06.680
-That's not your worry.
-And that's not your call!

56:06.714 --> 56:08.616
When we finish this thing
with Adelita,

56:08.649 --> 56:12.119
you can go tear up all
the high school pussy you want.

56:12.152 --> 56:14.321
But until then, seeing her?

56:14.354 --> 56:16.790
It's a bad fucking idea.

56:16.824 --> 56:18.792
Don't do it.

56:34.241 --> 56:37.177
-Sorry, Mom.
-Sorry.

56:48.689 --> 56:50.624
I was a fat little fucker.

56:56.196 --> 56:58.365
I hear you...

56:58.398 --> 57:01.301
about Emily.

57:01.334 --> 57:03.571
I got your back, Angel,

57:03.604 --> 57:06.339
no matter what.

57:06.373 --> 57:08.676
I know.

57:08.709 --> 57:11.311
I got you too, hermanito.

57:19.687 --> 57:21.589
I gotta call Adelita.

57:21.622 --> 57:24.725
Let her know we got a buyer.

57:27.595 --> 57:29.362
You and Adelita.

57:29.396 --> 57:31.699
Nothing.

57:31.732 --> 57:33.767
We're just business partners.

57:54.321 --> 57:56.556
What are you doing here?

58:04.064 --> 58:07.635
I visited your old man today.

58:07.668 --> 58:09.703
What

58:09.737 --> 58:12.305
I wanted to feel closer...

58:12.339 --> 58:14.407
to family.

58:20.280 --> 58:24.752
My real name
is Ignacio Cortina.

58:24.785 --> 58:26.920
I was an inspector

58:26.954 --> 58:29.990
for División Antidrogas
Federales.

58:30.023 --> 58:32.826
Late '70s, early '80s.

58:35.462 --> 58:38.098
My partner and I...

58:40.533 --> 58:43.336
We did some...

58:43.370 --> 58:45.438
very bad things

58:45.472 --> 58:48.008
for some very bad people.

58:49.376 --> 58:50.911
Jesus.

58:50.944 --> 58:53.313
I've done everything
in my power...

58:54.715 --> 58:58.051
To keep myself and my family
from that life.

58:59.653 --> 59:03.056
Please don't make me
become that man again.

59:05.325 --> 59:08.929
Don't fuck with my family

59:08.962 --> 59:11.799
or I'll ruin you.

59:13.300 --> 59:16.136
And everything you love.

59:17.137 --> 59:18.972
What are you talking about?

59:19.006 --> 59:21.875
Hey. Felipe!

59:33.586 --> 59:35.522
Fuck.

59:40.027 --> 59:41.862
Where have you been?

59:45.098 --> 59:46.633
Had to clear my head.

59:46.666 --> 59:48.168
Took an Uber.

59:51.204 --> 59:58.178
*

1:00:28.742 --> 1:00:30.878
You're smoking a lot.

1:00:37.985 --> 1:00:40.854
Where did you go?

1:00:40.888 --> 1:00:43.556
I just needed to be
alone for a while.

1:00:46.259 --> 1:00:49.262
Alone with EZ.

1:00:53.400 --> 1:00:56.403
I know he came to
the hospital this morning.

1:00:59.572 --> 1:01:02.409
Just for a minute.

1:01:02.442 --> 1:01:05.112
He heard what happened.
It was nothing.

1:01:19.092 --> 1:01:21.895
Please don't get into
strangers' cars.

1:01:21.929 --> 1:01:24.431
We don't Uber.

1:01:28.101 --> 1:01:29.669
Why don't you just
make a list

1:01:29.702 --> 1:01:32.172
of what I can and can't do?

1:01:34.107 --> 1:01:36.109
I need to know where you are

1:01:36.143 --> 1:01:37.410
so I can keep you safe.

1:01:37.444 --> 1:01:39.779
As safe as you kept
Cristobal?

1:01:39.813 --> 1:01:42.782
Why couldn't you keep
our son safe?

1:01:42.816 --> 1:01:44.852
He was with his mother.

1:01:44.885 --> 1:01:47.787
I thought he was safe.
I was wrong.

1:01:49.456 --> 1:01:51.658
You let them take my son.

1:01:54.161 --> 1:01:55.662
Take that back.

1:01:57.697 --> 1:01:59.266
The truth can't be
taken back.

1:02:05.205 --> 1:02:06.940
You gonna beat me, Jefe?

1:02:06.974 --> 1:02:08.175
Like your daddy used to
beat Dita?

1:02:08.208 --> 1:02:09.709
-Don't.

1:02:09.742 --> 1:02:12.145
You gonna cave my head in
with a baseball bat?

1:02:16.816 --> 1:02:19.819
Am I Galindo's little puta?

1:02:36.536 --> 1:02:38.438
Ah--

1:02:41.274 --> 1:02:48.015
*

1:02:51.551 --> 1:02:58.558
*
