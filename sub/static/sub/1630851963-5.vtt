WEBVTT

00:39.440 --> 00:41.200
Yeah.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.120
<i>We found something
at Wingate's place,</i>

00:43.160 --> 00:45.160
<i>his dog had blood
on his collar.</i>

00:45.200 --> 00:46.800
What, it's not
Wingate's blood?

00:46.840 --> 00:48.880
Or the dead police officer's.
PC Jarvis.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.040
Do you wanna
chase it up with me?

00:51.080 --> 00:52.480
<i>Yeah, I can't.
I'm, uh...</i>

00:53.480 --> 00:54.880
in the archive.

00:54.920 --> 00:58.040
Hmm, sure sounds
windy down there.

00:58.080 --> 00:59.480
All right, Jessica Fletcher,
you got me.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.760
I was in the archives.
Now I'm looking for a Starbucks

01:01.800 --> 01:03.360
because I want a Frap
and a crap before work.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.760
TMI?

01:05.800 --> 01:08.520
Were you looking for information
related to the eyewitness?

01:08.560 --> 01:10.360
Because if you give me
their name,

01:10.400 --> 01:11.760
maybe I can help.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.160
I'm getting really
bored of this.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.280
I promised I'd withhold
their name, to protect them.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.280
That's the end of it.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.200
Excuse me!
Hey.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.520
<i>We are sorry to announce</i>

01:46.560 --> 01:50.640
<i>that the 5:15 train to London
Fenchurch Street calling at...</i>

02:22.320 --> 02:24.080
<i>That was quick.
Take the tunnel?</i>

02:24.120 --> 02:25.400
Where are you?

02:25.440 --> 02:26.720
<i>They fleece you for it,
don't they?</i>

02:26.760 --> 02:28.320
<i>And that's on top
of the Congestion Charge.</i>

02:28.360 --> 02:31.720
<i>Every time I get in my car,
I feel like I'm being penalized.</i>

02:31.760 --> 02:33.000
Where are you?

02:34.720 --> 02:35.800
<i>Look on the back
of the envelope.</i>

02:40.600 --> 02:41.640
<i>See you there.</i>

02:49.720 --> 02:50.960
<i>♪ Always a fight</i>

02:51.000 --> 02:53.680
<i>♪ Keep your mind intact</i>

02:53.720 --> 02:56.720
<i>♪ Re-live the fire
When you're looking back ♪</i>

02:56.760 --> 02:58.240
<i>♪ 'Cause it's over</i>

03:00.640 --> 03:02.200
<i>♪ Yes, it's over</i>

03:04.240 --> 03:09.760

<i>♪ Yet it's so real</i>

03:16.560 --> 03:18.840
<i>♪ So real</i>

03:20.280 --> 03:24.960

03:25.000 --> 03:28.960

03:53.240 --> 03:56.160
Andrew Daly's refusing
to come into protective custody.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.360
<i>Andrew Daly?</i>

03:57.400 --> 03:58.760
<i>You've found the next name
on the list?</i>

03:58.800 --> 03:59.920
Well yeah, but this guy

03:59.960 --> 04:00.920
is one of 29 Andrew
Dalys in the UK.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.200
You want me to go
in the police van?

04:02.240 --> 04:03.720
It's weird, cause the other
fellas on the list

04:03.760 --> 04:05.560
have all got links
towards the Hooper's trial.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.360
But none of these Andrew Dalys
have any connection to Hooper.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.120
- Move back! Move back!

04:10.160 --> 04:12.840
Any other Andrews
live in Southend?

04:12.880 --> 04:14.840
<i>In Essex?
No, I don't think so.</i>

04:14.880 --> 04:16.760
There's nothing
that links Southend

04:16.800 --> 04:19.160
to the Ragdoll investigation?

04:19.200 --> 04:21.800
Not that I know of.
What's put the wind up you?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.600
Nothing, just received
a prank call about towns

04:27.640 --> 04:28.920
starting with S. Forget it.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.400
Andy will prefer
to stay with his community.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.400
I don't blame him.

04:40.760 --> 04:41.960
You lot embarrassed yourselves.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.480
<i>Hello, Rose.</i>

05:19.240 --> 05:20.960
Looking around.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.200
It's not much
of an origin story, is it?

05:24.240 --> 05:26.960
It's like a gammon-y take on <i>
Beauty and the Beast.</i>

05:27.000 --> 05:31.680
I imagine you, stuck in this
provincial little town,

05:31.720 --> 05:34.240
shit-posting Meghan Markle
on the <i>Daily Mail,</i>

05:35.800 --> 05:37.160
yearning for more.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.560
<i>Your contempt for
ordinary people is scary</i>

05:39.600 --> 05:42.320
<i>but it's not surprising.
They don't understand you.</i>

05:42.360 --> 05:44.000
<i>Most of them have only
been traumatized</i>

05:44.040 --> 05:45.840
<i>seven times in their lives.</i>

05:45.880 --> 05:48.280
<i>Coppers are traumatized
700 times.</i>

05:48.320 --> 05:49.960
Citation needed.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.880
<i>You're predisposed
to violence.</i>

05:53.920 --> 05:55.480
<i>You don't have a choice
about that.</i>

05:55.520 --> 05:56.920
<i>And then you get hammered
by the job.</i>

05:56.960 --> 06:00.600
<i>I can't flower it up, mate.
You scare me.</i>

06:22.840 --> 06:26.120
You think you've chosen to do
this, to become The Faust?

06:26.160 --> 06:28.280
<i>You paid me
to kill Mark Hooper.</i>

06:28.320 --> 06:31.320
<i>You paid with your own life.
You don't have principles.</i>

06:31.360 --> 06:33.200
<i>You're desperate
for gratification.</i>

06:33.240 --> 06:37.040
<i>You want blood.
I chose to answer a calling.</i>

06:37.080 --> 06:39.600
<i>I chose to Kill Joel Shepton
in his sleep.</i>

06:39.640 --> 06:42.080
Joel Shepton was unwell.

06:42.120 --> 06:46.200
<i>I don't coerce anyone.
You all come to me.</i>

06:46.240 --> 06:48.320
Michelle Fielding?
They didn't call you.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.240
Alyssa Airley?

06:50.280 --> 06:52.720
<i>You made me realize how
hard you've got to shake people</i>

06:52.760 --> 06:54.480
<i>to make them open their eyes.</i>

06:58.760 --> 07:02.800
<i>What happens
if you do arrest me?</i>

07:02.840 --> 07:05.800
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

07:05.840 --> 07:09.280
<i>March me into the office,
"Surprise!"</i>

07:09.320 --> 07:11.960
<i>What happens
in that total fantasy?</i>

07:12.840 --> 07:14.600
<i>Do you get forgiven?</i>

07:14.640 --> 07:20.360
<i>I know your medication has
hallucinogenic side effects.</i>

07:23.440 --> 07:25.000
You are tripping balls!

07:34.960 --> 07:36.680
<i>They won't forgive you
this time.</i>

07:36.720 --> 07:40.200
<i>Mark Hooper's one thing
but you got a copper killed.</i>

07:40.240 --> 07:42.080
<i>There is no way back.</i>

07:42.120 --> 07:44.440
So you tell me,
what am I doing here,

07:44.480 --> 07:45.560
what do I want?

07:45.600 --> 07:47.080
<i>Lie to the Black girl.</i>

07:47.120 --> 07:49.600
<i>Not to me. You know
what you want to do.</i>

07:49.640 --> 07:51.440
So let's do it,
let's finish this.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.080
Last man standing gets
to tell his story.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.840
No one else needs to die.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.920
<i>Meet me on the pier.
Stocky bloke, green jacket.</i>

08:33.360 --> 08:34.960
<i>You live, I die.</i>

08:35.000 --> 08:37.520
<i>You get to save Andrew
Daly's life, if you kill me.</i>

08:37.560 --> 08:40.960
Bullshit. You've come this far,
you don't want to lose.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.880
<i>Oh, this is how I win.</i>

08:42.920 --> 08:45.720
<i>True justice is tempered
by mercy.</i>

08:45.760 --> 08:48.080
<i>This way, people will see me
for who I am</i>

08:48.120 --> 08:51.040
<i>and you for the monster
you've always been.</i>

08:51.080 --> 08:53.960
<i>Do it. You want to save lives?
Do you want to end this?</i>

08:54.000 --> 08:54.960
<i>Pull the trigger.</i>

09:46.000 --> 09:47.320
The rash on
Elijah Reed's torso,

09:48.880 --> 09:50.680
Finlay thought
it was a nicotine patch,

09:50.720 --> 09:51.800
but Reed didn't smoke.

09:57.000 --> 09:57.840
I cut myself shaving.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.360
Genuinely.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.920
What did I say?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.320
It's not all about you.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.520
You didn't sue,
you were a kid.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.000
Yeah, my mum did.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.280
She had to.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.400
The Army kitted your dad out
with dodgy equipment and...

10:19.440 --> 10:21.960
Shot him up with a Challenger 2
and Andrea's acting like

10:22.000 --> 10:25.200
I'm too busy crying my eyes out
to catch the Ragdoll killer.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.920
They took that picture
off my brother's Facebook.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.240
That was the day
I held my breath

10:28.280 --> 10:30.480
for 83 seconds underwater.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.720
You've bragged about it.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.200
Damn right,
I never did it again.

10:33.240 --> 10:34.200
You took up ciggies.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.240
We saw everything.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.000
The reef,
sting rays, a wreck.

10:41.640 --> 10:42.680
You've got to ignore it.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.240
That's easy for you to say.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.960
Actually, no. It isn't.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.240
I had journalists trying to take

10:48.280 --> 10:50.040
photos of me in the hospital.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.000
Even when I got out, they were
camped out on my door step,

10:52.040 --> 10:53.920
that's why I had to move
to the high-rise.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.240
Look, I know,
it was hell for you

10:55.280 --> 10:56.760
and I know you didn't
deserve it,

10:56.800 --> 10:57.760
- but this...
- No one deserves it.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.280
You looked fit
in Edmunds' jacket.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.320
So they built you up and now
they're tearing you down.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.000
People like to talk a big game
about empathy,

11:06.040 --> 11:08.280
but we're all hardwired
to love a scapegoat.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.880
This is different,
this is playing into those

11:09.920 --> 11:11.320
dog-whistle stereotypes.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.200
- I see that.
- Like I'm this chippy woman

11:13.240 --> 11:16.440
who knows how to game the system
with her sob stories,

11:16.480 --> 11:18.680
like that's the only reason
I'm in this job.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.160
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what your options are.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.840
Bax... Emily.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.240
Uh, the blood
from the dog's collar,

11:42.280 --> 11:44.600
we found a match from a sample
taken from a break-in

11:44.640 --> 11:46.840
at a psychiatric hospital
12 months ago.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.920
Well, that sounds
promisingly macabre.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.080
That's great news,
you moody bastard.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.080
Look at the name
of the hospital.

12:04.040 --> 12:05.560
Forgive the carnival atmosphere.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.640
It's music therapy.

12:07.480 --> 12:08.360
Yay!

12:11.280 --> 12:12.760
Does it bring back
any memories?

12:12.800 --> 12:15.280
Rose didn't want me to visit.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.520
What, you've never
been here before?

12:17.560 --> 12:19.040
It was his decision.
I wasn't gonna, you know,

12:19.080 --> 12:19.920
disobey him.

12:20.760 --> 12:23.120
This is where he broke in.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.320
When your man put his weight
against it, the glass broke.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.960
And you hope
it's the Ragdoll chap?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.720
Well, the blood
taken from this glass

12:31.760 --> 12:34.000
matches the blood at
Matthew Wingate's house.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.960
- The judge?
Yeah.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.560
But the samples don't match
anyone on our database.

12:40.280 --> 12:43.760
The thing is, Rose had left
by the time of the break-in.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.840
The killer's obsessed
with the Mark Hooper trial.

12:46.880 --> 12:50.040
I'm assuming you and Rose
spoke about it in detail.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.600
Have you got any
of that written down?

12:52.280 --> 12:53.360
Hmm.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.240
I'll speak to the patients.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.520
Someone's torn
the pages out.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.960
Look, three here,

13:05.440 --> 13:06.880
another couple here.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.080
You didn't tear them
out yourself?

13:08.120 --> 13:09.280
No.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.880
Did anything abnormal happen
around the time of the break-in?

13:15.880 --> 13:20.800
Well, it's not too
unusual sadly,

13:20.840 --> 13:22.320
but a patient
committed suicide.

13:24.640 --> 13:25.840
What was their name?

13:26.440 --> 13:27.680
I shouldn't say.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.560
But Nathan's clearly been
so affected by it.

13:32.680 --> 13:33.800
It was Joel Shepton,

13:34.400 --> 13:35.440
Nathan's friend.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.120
When did you tell him?

13:42.160 --> 13:43.520
When did I see Nathan?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.240
Monday.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.960
And then, yes, Tuesday morning.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.480
Monday, Tuesday this week?

13:48.520 --> 13:50.240
Yes.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.880
Nathan returned on the Tuesday
on behalf of Joel's family.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.280
Teresa, Joel's sister,

13:56.320 --> 13:57.480
she'd been murdered.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.840
Teresa?

14:01.320 --> 14:02.640
Was the killer ever caught?

14:02.680 --> 14:03.960
Joel was of the opinion that,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.120
as an addict
and a person of color,

14:06.160 --> 14:08.320
Teresa was not a priority.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.080
The police didn't
investigate it properly.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.080
Teresa Shepton.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.560
Teresa Shepton.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.920
Joel, that's Adam...

14:41.760 --> 14:42.840
Keith.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.600
<i>Hello, Morgue.</i>

15:00.640 --> 15:02.080
Yeah, this is DI Baxter.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.280
Um, one of the bodies
you've got down there,

15:04.320 --> 15:05.840
Keith Rackman, he's got a cut

15:05.880 --> 15:07.840
on his forehead,
three stitches.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.880
DS Rose said
he'd fill out the report?

15:10.920 --> 15:13.400
<i>DS Rose.
He hasn't filed anything.</i>

15:13.440 --> 15:14.880
<i>I haven't seen him down here.</i>

15:14.920 --> 15:17.320
He definitely hasn't
been down there?

15:17.360 --> 15:18.840
<i>No, definitely not.</i>

15:36.840 --> 15:39.200
Right I need everyone
to clear out for half an hour.

15:40.880 --> 15:41.920
Whoa, whoa.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.080
Sorry,
forgot the handbrake.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.840
My bad.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.480
Are you trying to kill someone?

15:50.520 --> 15:51.680
No.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.280
Got it.
- Righto.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.160
Who's this?

17:09.200 --> 17:12.040
Andrew Daly. I promised him,
if he came quietly,

17:12.080 --> 17:13.600
he could make one
phone call from my office.

17:14.320 --> 17:15.400
Nice!

17:38.520 --> 17:40.720
Oops.
- Rose?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.960
- Sorry.
- Goddammit!

17:45.720 --> 17:47.320
You know, good excuse
for a good de-clutter.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.120
I mean, uh, did this spark joy?

17:49.160 --> 17:50.880
Those are my notes. Jesus.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.680
Where have you been,
by the way?

17:52.720 --> 17:53.840
We'll have to put a bell on you.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.440
What's that supposed to mean?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.360
Oh apparently that's what
we're doing these days.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.880
Keeping track of each other.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.840
You think you're being smart?

18:03.880 --> 18:05.760
You're making the biggest
mistake of your life.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.200
If I was in your situation,

18:08.240 --> 18:11.000
I'd be trying to think of
a really convincing explanation

18:11.040 --> 18:13.080
for whatever the hell
that was in Southend.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.760
- Don't walk away from me.
- Don't ever touch me.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.520
Edmunds!

18:17.560 --> 18:18.920
Wait for me in there, now.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.840
You can't lose control
like that.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.000
You're obsessed with how
things look. Who cares?

18:26.040 --> 18:28.560
Look around you. No one else
gets to be emotional.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.880
I'm a dead man walking.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.760
Wait, Bax.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.440
She put a tracker on my car.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.600
- Why would she do that?
- She's scared.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.160
I mean you did the same thing
in the Hooper trial.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.360
You wanted a scapegoat,

18:43.400 --> 18:44.880
only difference is,
I deserved it back then.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.720
- Why do you deserve it now?
- I don't!

18:46.760 --> 18:48.160
Why does she think
you deserve it?

18:48.200 --> 18:49.880
It doesn't matter.
The point is,

18:49.920 --> 18:52.040
if you ever stepped over a line
like that with a senior officer,

18:52.080 --> 18:53.760
I'd tell you to shut up
and take your medicine.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.120
Then we'd have a laugh
about it in the pub.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.480
Did you ever go
to Markfield prison?

18:58.200 --> 18:59.400
No.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.920
I wanted to on the day
that Eric Turner died.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.520
But you told me not to.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.440
But after that you said you'd
follow up on Keith Rackman?

19:05.240 --> 19:06.800
Yeah, yeah, I did that.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.680
So you did go to the prison?

19:10.720 --> 19:12.640
No. No, I went down
to the morgue.

19:12.680 --> 19:13.920
I didn't go to the prison.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.240
Did you put a tracking device
on Rose's car?

19:36.240 --> 19:38.560
So that's a "yes" then, is it?

19:38.600 --> 19:42.680
I followed Rose to
Southend-on-Sea. Okay?

19:42.720 --> 19:45.480
I heard him have a conversation
with someone on his cell.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.000
Rose was very angry
and he was talking about

19:48.040 --> 19:50.000
Michelle Fielding,
Alyssa Airley.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.960
And I heard him say
to this person,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.560
"You think you've been
chosen to do this,

19:55.600 --> 19:57.480
to become The Faust."

19:57.520 --> 19:58.400
What does that mean? The Faust?

19:58.440 --> 20:00.200
It's an alias.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.240
I think the Ragdoll killer
calls himself The Faust.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.640
You can't prove that Rose
was on the phone

20:04.680 --> 20:06.040
- with the killer, can you?
- Yes!

20:06.080 --> 20:07.640
The deep-fake call you received
at Wingate house.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.360
It lured you away long enough

20:09.400 --> 20:11.520
for the killer to rig
the squib vest.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.960
I found this in Rose's jacket.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.200
Rose knows that
there's a scrambler

20:18.240 --> 20:19.800
on this number
and he didn't tell us.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.920
Also, in Southend, he...

20:23.960 --> 20:25.800
He mentioned
another name. Keith?

20:26.320 --> 20:27.520
Keith Rackman...

20:29.120 --> 20:31.600
He was the prisoner
who died in Turner's van.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.840
He knew Joel Shepton.

20:33.880 --> 20:36.000
Wait, I heard him mention
that name too...

20:36.040 --> 20:38.760
Yeah, Joel was Nate's
friend on the ward.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.920
Joel's sister was killed
by Keith's mate,

20:40.960 --> 20:43.080
Adam Malick,
before Adam disappeared.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.120
Okay, so can we talk to Joel?

20:45.160 --> 20:47.800
Joel was found dead
12 hours after someone

20:47.840 --> 20:50.080
broke into the ward,
a presumed suicide.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.040
Yeah and that same person

20:52.080 --> 20:55.200
was at Wingate's house
the day he died.

20:55.240 --> 20:58.160
And that person is The Faust.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.080
But none of this
is admissible in court.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.400
You illegally
tracked Rose's car.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.960
You stole a number.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.560
Well...
I came to you first, Ma'am.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.160
None of this is evidence

21:09.200 --> 21:11.400
to suggest that
Rose is a murderer.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.760
Yeah but by withholding
this information,

21:13.800 --> 21:15.360
he is indirectly responsible
for the deaths

21:15.400 --> 21:17.200
of minimum two people.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.800
But to charge him,
we need to prove

21:18.840 --> 21:20.480
that Rose knew
all this information.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.000
We need to figure out
where he's been,

21:22.040 --> 21:23.480
who he's spoken to and why.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.560
Measure twice, cut once.
That's what my dad always said.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.920
That's what we're gonna do.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.560
And I'm not crazy,
I'm cooking.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.160
Why did you need
to shit on Baxter?

21:40.200 --> 21:42.120
They were running the story
with or without me.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.480
If you actually read the...

21:43.520 --> 21:44.680
You can see she's hurting,

21:44.720 --> 21:45.800
but you just keep piling
on the misery.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.040
You can't help yourself,
can you?

21:47.080 --> 21:49.840
Actually, I'm exercising pretty

21:49.880 --> 21:51.560
phenomenal self-control
right now.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.320
I'm terrible,
thank you for asking.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.480
I didn't get into this business
to get people killed.

22:09.480 --> 22:10.720
It's not your fault.

22:12.280 --> 22:13.920
Wingate was killed on my watch.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.000
We're all powerless.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.920
Whoever the killer is,
you can't stop him.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.040
No, that's not true, Andrea.
Listen, the killer

22:21.080 --> 22:22.640
- made a mistake, so I...
- I don't wanna know.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.840
I'm gonna stay with my daughter
in New York.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.920
And, honestly...

22:30.600 --> 22:32.400
I'm looking at your life
right now and I can't name

22:32.440 --> 22:34.200
one damn thing
that's keeping you here.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.280
The job.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.120
Baxter?

22:38.120 --> 22:40.480
Of course. I'd miss her.

22:40.520 --> 22:43.880
If you can live
without her, then run.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.360
I thought...

22:50.280 --> 22:52.920
I thought about killing myself.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.920
I never thought
about running away.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.560
Ma'am.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.880
The log
from Markfield Prison...

23:38.920 --> 23:41.440
the day Eric Turner died,
we signed in at 15:05

23:41.480 --> 23:42.640
at the top of this page.

23:42.680 --> 23:43.840
Look at the name at the bottom.

23:48.960 --> 23:49.800
Rose.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.240
I spoke with
Keith Rackman's cellmate.

23:54.280 --> 23:57.560
Rose bought him a burger
in exchange for information

23:57.600 --> 23:59.120
on the disappearance
of Adam Malick.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.920
Help me with these.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.200
Rose's old case files.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.680
Have a look to see
if there's anything in there

24:09.720 --> 24:11.200
that the killer could have used
to blackmail him.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.240
How are the Andrews?

24:15.280 --> 24:17.400
"The Andrews".

24:17.440 --> 24:19.200
Even saying it aloud
makes me feel like

24:19.240 --> 24:21.160
the killer just wants me
sat here, wasting my time.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.920
But I don't know why,
or what I can do about it.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.080
See, it all works
by misdirection...

24:28.120 --> 24:31.080
Look, keep your eye on the pen,

24:31.120 --> 24:33.560
not on the pencil,
that goes inside the pocket.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.520
Keep your eye
instead on the pen.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.280
See nothing in my
hand but watch.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.480
Wow!

24:39.520 --> 24:41.960
It changes into the pencil
and in my pocket...

24:42.960 --> 24:43.800
it's a pen!

25:48.400 --> 25:49.520
Andrea!

26:00.240 --> 26:01.240
<i>Andrea!</i>

26:04.280 --> 26:05.440
<i>Andrea!</i>

26:10.320 --> 26:11.680
Check downstairs.

26:15.720 --> 26:17.160
Andrea!

26:21.840 --> 26:23.640
Don't! Get him off her!

26:27.560 --> 26:30.040
Call an ambulance.
No one touch anything.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.880
Rose.
- Oh, my God!

26:34.120 --> 26:36.600
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

26:46.720 --> 26:49.520
Where's Baxter?

26:49.560 --> 26:50.520
She'll be back.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.240
In your own words,
tell me what happened.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.400
<i>The woman's body
was later identified</i>

27:26.440 --> 27:30.640
<i>as belonging to the journalist
and broadcaster Andrea Wyld.</i>

27:30.680 --> 27:32.680
<i>Miss Wyld
was a prominent critic...</i>

27:32.720 --> 27:34.360
<i>-...of the Greater London Police</i>

27:34.400 --> 27:37.760
<i>for their handling of several
high-profile investigations.</i>

27:37.800 --> 27:39.240
<i>Recently, she was
known to be...</i>

27:39.280 --> 27:41.760
Can I get you
a glass of water?

27:41.800 --> 27:44.400
No,
I'm alright darling.

27:44.440 --> 27:46.560
I just can't believe she's gone.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.480
Why...

27:56.600 --> 27:58.360
What on God's earth is that?

27:58.400 --> 28:00.400
The scold's bridle.

28:00.440 --> 28:03.240
It was designed to torture
and humiliate "witches",

28:03.760 --> 28:05.480
i.e. women,

28:05.520 --> 28:09.000
women in the 17th century
with opinions, troublemakers.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.160
That's a curb-plate.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.440
It sat on the tongue.
When they spoke, it cut them.

28:21.480 --> 28:25.120
He restrained her,
attached the bridle to her face.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.720
Then he made incisions...

28:30.800 --> 28:32.200
He made incisions on her hands,

28:32.240 --> 28:35.080
when she screamed,
the curb cut into her tongue.

28:35.120 --> 28:38.040
Right now we're trying
to work out if she...

28:38.080 --> 28:39.920
bled to death, or drowned
in her own blood.

28:49.800 --> 28:50.920
Rose, do you remember...

28:52.480 --> 28:54.640
if anything had been stuck
to the back of your neck?

28:54.680 --> 28:56.280
- Uh-huh.
- Nah.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.480
Don't touch, she's going to take
a photograph. Just stay still.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.160
You got a mirror?

29:02.440 --> 29:03.720
- A mirror?
- No, here, look.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.920
It's the same rash.

29:10.960 --> 29:13.000
It was on Elijah Reed's torso...

29:14.200 --> 29:15.960
- Mark Hooper's priest.
- Yeah.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.480
You're AB Negative, aren't you?

29:18.760 --> 29:20.080
- Yeah.
- It's like one in a hundred.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.320
Pass me the files, please.

29:22.120 --> 29:24.320
Let's see what Elijah is.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.760
It's an allergy to the sedative.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.320
Elijah Reed. AB Negative.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.480
Great, great, so...

29:31.520 --> 29:33.360
I mean, that'll help
with the tox scan. Does it?

29:34.960 --> 29:36.560
Bax,

29:36.600 --> 29:38.720
we know that the sedative

29:38.760 --> 29:41.520
is on a rectangular transdermal
patch he sticks on his victims.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.080
Bax...

29:55.480 --> 29:58.440
Has Rose said anything
about Andrea?

29:58.480 --> 30:01.000
Outside the initial statement,
um, he hasn't been very chatty.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.080
Could've fooled me.

30:04.120 --> 30:04.960
How's he feeling?

30:06.600 --> 30:08.920
- I didn't ask directly.
- He's finished. You know that?

30:10.800 --> 30:12.240
Rose needs to see
a professional.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.560
I've spoken to his old doctor.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.080
He's briefed me
on how to handle Rose.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.040
Maybe somebody else
should do it.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.480
In case I get too emotional?

30:24.520 --> 30:26.600
No, you'll have it locked down,
like you always do.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.640
Look Rose esteems you.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.080
God, I don't know
what label to put on it.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.760
And if you go in there
with all guns blazing,

30:37.600 --> 30:38.480
you might break him.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.000
<i>Now, the first thing to do</i>

30:52.040 --> 30:54.240
<i>is to work out
what color concealer</i>

30:54.280 --> 30:55.920
<i>you need to use.</i>

30:55.960 --> 30:57.600
<i>-You wanna match...</i>

31:03.440 --> 31:05.440
Andrea drowned.

31:05.480 --> 31:09.160
The sedative basically
disabled her gag reflex.

31:10.320 --> 31:11.640
Her lungs are full of blood.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.760
And they found semen.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.480
They'll check to see
if it's a match with Rose.

31:21.400 --> 31:22.880
I should have seen this coming.

31:22.920 --> 31:24.800
No.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.920
Hey, the killer never concealed

31:26.960 --> 31:28.600
the identity of anyone else
on that list.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.600
He has broken his own rules.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.720
That is incredibly unusual.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.880
Andrea published my complaint
during the Hooper trial.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.680
Wait, the complaint about Rose?
I thought Chambers wrote that?

31:37.720 --> 31:39.680
We swapped names.

31:39.720 --> 31:42.480
Then he sold it
to Andrea Daly... Wyld.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.240
I gave the killer permission
to be dishonest.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.320
But how would
the killer know that?

31:49.360 --> 31:52.080
Maybe Chambers told him...

31:52.120 --> 31:54.480
begging for his life...
I don't know.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.440
Wait...

32:13.680 --> 32:15.440
That's a perfect match.

32:15.480 --> 32:17.240
Even the killer missed it.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.960
He was probably panicking
when he heard us coming.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.040
He was rushing.

32:21.080 --> 32:22.960
Could you just give us
a second, thank you.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.240
Come look at this.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.280
This is Andrea's.

32:32.320 --> 32:35.160
<i>Then after that, you can use
your own concealer.</i>

32:35.200 --> 32:36.640
<i>Now for you...</i>

32:36.680 --> 32:40.000
<i>I like to use a Fair Rose...</i>

32:40.040 --> 32:43.280
She knows a hell of a lot
about Andrea's skin. Who is she?

32:43.320 --> 32:46.000
Andrea was a regular commentator
on a news and opinion show.

32:46.040 --> 32:48.240
That would bring her into
contact with make-up artists.

32:48.280 --> 32:50.800
Make-up artists use
transdermal patches, right?

32:50.840 --> 32:52.560
They use acetone. Remember,

32:52.600 --> 32:55.040
Daniel Airley's memory
from inside the kidnapper's car.

32:56.440 --> 32:57.960
Maybe she's being blackmailed

32:58.000 --> 33:01.480
or tricked into helping him.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.800
- Or maybe she's an accomplice.
- It's worth a shot.

33:07.400 --> 33:10.520
I've got to deal
with Rose first.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.440
Don't speak to that woman
without me.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.520
Yes, ma'am.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.600
Christ!
Can you give me a minute?

33:31.720 --> 33:33.800
I know you spoke
to Keith Rackman.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.240
What... wait, I can't hear you.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.480
I know about Keith Rackman,

33:39.520 --> 33:41.000
about his connection
to Joel Shepton.

33:47.480 --> 33:50.080
Yeah, small world.

33:52.520 --> 33:53.800
Seriously, can you
pass me a towel?

33:55.080 --> 33:56.160
I know about The Faust.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.680
The Ragdoll killer,
it's the same person.

34:01.720 --> 34:02.840
I know that he's implicated

34:02.880 --> 34:04.200
in the disappearance
of Adam Malick.

34:05.680 --> 34:06.760
I know that
he broke into the ward,

34:06.800 --> 34:08.480
possibly to kill Joel Shepton.

34:08.520 --> 34:10.960
I know you know all of that.
And you lied to me.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.400
Joel told me...

34:14.440 --> 34:17.040
that The Faust was A Hit Man,

34:17.960 --> 34:18.880
a Myth.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.640
He said he made a deal with him.

34:22.680 --> 34:25.160
And then The Faust killed Adam
and then he killed Joel.

34:25.200 --> 34:27.600
You can call it
justice or revenge,

34:28.280 --> 34:29.360
but I wanted it.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.200
And I made a deal, too.

34:32.240 --> 34:33.920
My life for Mark Hooper.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.200
So why didn't you tell me?

34:37.240 --> 34:38.640
In the hospital, half the time

34:38.680 --> 34:40.000
I didn't know
whose dream I was in.

34:40.640 --> 34:41.720
And then,

34:42.480 --> 34:44.640
two years later,

34:44.680 --> 34:46.640
Hooper's head on the Ragdoll

34:46.680 --> 34:48.720
and my name's on the list.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.640
And I didn't believe it
at first.

34:50.680 --> 34:52.440
Yeah, but then you found
a number with a scrambler on it.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.560
You spoke to him!

34:53.600 --> 34:55.040
Yeah, because he
recorded my voice.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.000
That's who I was speaking to
on the roof.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.040
You said that you were
talking to your therapist.

34:59.080 --> 35:02.560
You allowed me to blame myself
for hurting you.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.360
You know, up on the roof,
I wanted to die.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.840
The Faust said...

35:06.880 --> 35:08.280
that if I jumped, he'd kill you.

35:11.920 --> 35:12.920
Oh...

35:23.240 --> 35:25.360
Nathan Rose, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of aiding

35:25.400 --> 35:28.320
and abetting the murder
of Mark Hooper.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.800
And on suspicion of perverting
the course of justice

35:30.840 --> 35:32.760
by intentionally
misleading the police.

35:35.280 --> 35:39.440
He's a white male, 30s, stocky,

35:39.480 --> 35:42.600
beard, blue eyes, boxer's nose,

35:42.640 --> 35:45.160
possibly a medical professional
and an estuary accent.

35:45.720 --> 35:46.920
He won.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.520
He won.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.080
Get dressed! Call your lawyer!

36:01.040 --> 36:02.080
I'm taking this
so you can't get out.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.040
I'll be back in three minutes.

36:43.440 --> 36:44.640
Rose?

36:44.680 --> 36:46.200
Now I want you to keep calm,

36:46.240 --> 36:48.280
because there's a really
easy way through this, okay?

36:49.600 --> 36:51.080
I've got Hannah's letter.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.640
<i>The one that she wrote to you.
It's with me now.</i>

36:54.880 --> 36:57.400
<i>I spoke to an old colleague
of yours from Jersey.</i>

36:57.440 --> 37:00.080
<i>He told me about Naomi Green.</i>

37:00.120 --> 37:03.520
He said that Naomi Green
killed an associate of hers

37:03.560 --> 37:05.000
before skipping bail.

37:05.040 --> 37:09.400
Now, according to this letter,
Naomi is your ex.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.000
You piece of shit.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.680
<i>She was the love of your life.</i>

37:12.720 --> 37:15.000
<i>And you paid her bail!
In secret!</i>

37:15.040 --> 37:16.520
That is
a career-ending decision...

37:16.560 --> 37:18.480
What do you want, Rose?

37:18.520 --> 37:20.240
<i>I'm in the locker room
on the fourth floor.</i>

37:20.280 --> 37:22.640
Slide your ID under the door.
And I'll give you the letter.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.680
I was so right about you.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.720
<i>It won't hurt the case,
I've told Baxter everything.</i>

37:26.760 --> 37:27.960
Can you see her now?

37:28.560 --> 37:30.080
Yeah, she's on the phone.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.920
<i>Good. So do it now. Stand up.</i>

37:33.080 --> 37:34.200
<i>Don't run.</i>

37:34.240 --> 37:35.440
<i>-You're 90 seconds away...
- I can't.</i>

37:35.480 --> 37:37.000
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

37:37.040 --> 37:38.160
<i>You bailed a murderer.</i>

37:38.200 --> 37:39.400
<i>You're an accessory
after the fact.</i>

37:39.440 --> 37:42.640
No. No. It wasn't like that.

37:42.680 --> 37:46.800
<i>Even if you get off jail,
your career is over.</i>

37:46.840 --> 37:49.560
<i>And you have so much potential.</i>

37:49.600 --> 37:53.840
<i>I mean that. It would be tragic.
Don't let one mistake...</i>

37:56.760 --> 37:57.840
Finlay...

39:06.880 --> 39:08.600
Well, Edmunds has got
a lead on a make-up artist,

39:08.640 --> 39:09.640
a woman called Joy...

39:09.680 --> 39:11.000
Right, a make-up artist?

39:28.520 --> 39:30.520
Oh, God! I'm such an arsehole!

39:32.200 --> 39:35.880
Rose looked pathetic, broken!
And I felt guilty!

39:36.960 --> 39:39.160
He played you.

39:39.200 --> 39:41.520
- He's desperate.
- Why didn't I listen to you?

39:42.960 --> 39:44.360
Because you've been
getting kicked in the blif

39:44.400 --> 39:45.560
for seven days straight.

39:46.760 --> 39:47.800
Try not to beat yourself up.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.360
Bark an order at me
or something, go on.

39:53.960 --> 39:57.000
Rose has been blinding me
from the start.

39:57.040 --> 40:00.040
We're gonna have to go back
to the beginning.

40:00.080 --> 40:03.840
Measure twice, cut once,
meet me at the morgue.

40:03.880 --> 40:07.880
What do knots tell us
about the person who tied them?

40:07.920 --> 40:09.880
Their profession,
their proficiency

40:09.920 --> 40:11.640
and whether they're
left or right-handed.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.960
Well, we'd, um,
have to recreate the knot.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.120
Yeah. We're going
to have to go right back

40:18.160 --> 40:19.360
to the first throw
of the stitching.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.920
So, we're gonna
rebuild The Ragdoll?

40:26.200 --> 40:27.840
- Shall I be Igor?

40:47.280 --> 40:49.240
- Ma'am, I heard about Rose.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.120
And I really hope you're okay.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.520
I figured you were busy
so I'm gonna...

41:05.760 --> 41:06.840
I'm gonna go...

41:08.080 --> 41:09.800
talk to Andrea's make-up artist.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.600
I'm outside of her house
right now.

41:12.640 --> 41:15.480
Her name is Joy Massey,
spelt M-A-S-S-E-Y.

41:36.880 --> 41:38.640
That's a left-handed
surgical knot.

41:39.720 --> 41:40.960
Yes, so we're saying The Faust

41:41.000 --> 41:44.320
is a left-handed
medical professional?

41:44.360 --> 41:49.440
Well, a left-handed surgeon
can tie right-handed stitches,

41:49.480 --> 41:51.400
but it would be weird
for a right-handed surgeon

41:51.440 --> 41:53.320
to tie left-handed stitches.

41:53.360 --> 41:54.760
Keith Rackman had stitches.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.160
A coincidence?

41:56.200 --> 41:57.920
Hm.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.960
In this investigation,
no such thing.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.080
That looks like the same knot.

42:17.080 --> 42:22.120
We've a male nurse on the staff
at The Markfield Moor Prison.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.720
His name is Thomas Massey.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.840
No priors.

42:26.880 --> 42:30.240
Rose's witness described
him as stocky, beard, blue eyes.

42:30.280 --> 42:31.800
It looks like
he was on the early shift

42:31.840 --> 42:33.720
the day that
Keith and Eric died.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.560
And it looks like he might have
left around about the same time

42:36.600 --> 42:37.680
that you arrived.

42:38.920 --> 42:40.320
I think I saw him.

42:41.120 --> 42:42.240
Where's Edmunds?

42:49.200 --> 42:50.840
<i>Ma'am, I heard about Rose.</i>

42:50.880 --> 42:53.000
<i>I hope you're okay.</i>

42:53.040 --> 42:55.040
<i>I figured you were busy
so I'm gonna...</i>

42:56.880 --> 42:58.360
<i>...talk to Andrea's
make-up artist.</i>

42:58.400 --> 42:59.880
You idiot.

42:59.920 --> 43:01.120
<i>I'm outside of her house
right now.</i>

43:01.160 --> 43:04.320
<i>Her name is Joy Massey,
spelt M-A-S-S-E-Y.</i>

43:07.720 --> 43:09.200
Holy shit. Holy shit!

43:11.120 --> 43:13.280
The make-up artist,
she's called Joy Massey.

43:13.320 --> 43:14.240
They're family!

43:20.240 --> 43:21.960
My husband isn't home yet.

43:22.760 --> 43:24.840
That's okay. I uh...

43:28.080 --> 43:30.040
wanted to speak
with you Mrs. Massey.

43:31.560 --> 43:32.800
It's about Andrea Wyld.

43:33.400 --> 43:34.560
Oh.

43:35.720 --> 43:37.280
Oh, God, it's awful.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.880
This is a dumb question,
I'm sure, but...

43:44.920 --> 43:47.480
can you make your own
transdermal patches?

43:47.520 --> 43:50.880
Uh, well,

43:50.920 --> 43:53.840
you can order them tailor-made
to match any skin tone.

43:55.320 --> 43:57.880
Biccy? Little cheeky dunker?

44:03.960 --> 44:06.680
If someone is listening
to this conversation

44:06.720 --> 44:07.960
offer me honey.

44:09.240 --> 44:11.520
Bless you.

44:11.560 --> 44:13.240
No one's listening!

44:23.320 --> 44:24.360
Ah...

44:26.240 --> 44:29.360
This is DC Edmunds,
she was asking me about...

44:29.400 --> 44:31.360
Mind's like a sieve.

44:31.400 --> 44:34.040
Andrea's skin tone.
The transdermal patches.

44:34.080 --> 44:36.520
That's right. You wanted
to know about the patches.

44:37.880 --> 44:38.800
Tea, love?

44:41.440 --> 44:42.280
Just be a tick.

44:57.640 --> 44:58.760
Sorry.

45:05.360 --> 45:06.400
Long day?

45:07.720 --> 45:08.880
I can't complain...

45:10.400 --> 45:11.760
It's never dull...

45:16.480 --> 45:17.960
No...

45:38.560 --> 45:40.360
[theYou like it?yi

45:40.400 --> 45:42.440
I wanted something with
- a tape deck.
- You lost your mind?

45:42.480 --> 45:43.920
The cassettes are back.

45:43.960 --> 45:45.240
Nostalgia for
the unremembered '90s.

45:48.320 --> 45:50.120
You may find this
hard to believe,

45:50.160 --> 45:53.000
but I don't want
to make you suffer.

45:53.040 --> 45:54.960
So you didn't give me
a chance?

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
You didn't give me a chance!

45:57.040 --> 46:00.120
The truth is the only thing
that will save you.

46:00.160 --> 46:01.400
Get out.

46:01.440 --> 46:03.200
The thing is,
it's my office.

46:03.240 --> 46:04.640
I'll give you a minute.
