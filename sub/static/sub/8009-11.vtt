00:09.999 --> 00:11.998
Keeping
Up with the Kardashians...

00:11.999 --> 00:13.998
What happened in your
last delivery?

00:13.999 --> 00:15.998
- I had preeclampsia.
- You have a higher

00:15.999 --> 00:17.998
risk for it to happen in the
next pregnancy.

00:17.999 --> 00:19.998
- So we have to watch.
- To know that I might

00:19.999 --> 00:22.998
have another health issue really
kind of freaks me out.

00:22.999 --> 00:26.998
- I'm, like, actually scared.
- It's just been a

00:26.999 --> 00:30.998
really hard time, going from,
like, having all of you guys to

00:30.999 --> 00:35.998
having nobody, you know?
I just... I just can't do this.

00:35.999 --> 00:37.998
What does that mean,
you "can't do this"?

00:37.999 --> 00:39.999
The note that he sent
Khloe was like, "Tell Bugs I

00:40.000 --> 00:42.998
love her and I can't go on
without her."

00:42.999 --> 00:44.998
He said he had no
reason to live.

00:44.999 --> 00:46.998
- And it was pretty scary.
- Scott put himself in

00:46.999 --> 00:51.998
the situation that he's in.
It's really about him deciding

00:51.999 --> 00:53.999
just what kind of life he wants
to live.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.999
It's like, then do something
about it.

01:02.999 --> 01:05.998
Cait cannot come to
Mom's birthday.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.998
Cannot
come... she physically can't come

01:08.999 --> 01:10.998
'cause she's in New York.
I was like,

01:10.999 --> 01:12.998
"That was so aggressive."
Yeah. You said it,

01:12.999 --> 01:14.998
like, in a tone where you were,
like, banning her from coming.

01:14.999 --> 01:16.998
Whatever the great Cait wants.

01:16.999 --> 01:18.998
I want my name to be
something like that.

01:18.999 --> 01:21.998
The great Cait?
Khloe Blowy?

01:21.999 --> 01:23.998
That wasn't my name in
high school.

01:23.999 --> 01:25.998
That was another Chloe's name in
high school.

01:25.999 --> 01:27.998
Rob told my dad that my nickname
was Khloe Blowy, and I was like,

01:27.999 --> 01:30.998
"That was not me.
I'm the fat one.

01:30.999 --> 01:33.998
Who's gonna want blowjobs from
the fat girl?"

01:33.999 --> 01:35.999
Being fat really saved me from
being a whore in life though,

01:36.000 --> 01:37.999
you guys.
Being fat and then being

01:38.000 --> 01:40.998
married.
But I respect Lamar, because he

01:40.999 --> 01:43.998
still liked me fat, which is,
like... I appreciate that.

01:43.999 --> 01:46.998
That's what his hold has
been over you this whole time?

01:46.999 --> 01:48.998

02:44.999 --> 02:46.998
You know, I'm very overwhelmed.

02:46.999 --> 02:48.999
Maybe because you work
constantly and you're about to

- And, like, the veins on

Mom, " and I'm just like, " Kid,
I'll give you whatever you want.

Kim is a trooper.

03:05.999 --> 03:08.998

I think this pregnancy
is way more scary to me because

09:38.999 --> 09:40.998
of the medical issues I had
before.

09:40.999 --> 09:44.998
So, overall...
abnormal.

09:44.999 --> 09:46.998
How was party planning?

09:46.999 --> 09:48.998
I mean, I'm gonna need
you to kind of step it up a

09:48.999 --> 09:50.998
- little bit.
- Um...

09:50.999 --> 09:54.998
Before you know it,
it's gonna be her birthday.

09:54.999 --> 09:56.998
It's one thing to be a
workaholic and make all this

09:56.999 --> 09:59.998
success and all the business,
but if your ass not healthy, all

09:59.999 --> 10:07.999
- that means zero.
- But I can't just stop.

10:11.999 --> 10:15.998
Hi.
Do I have to sign in here?

10:15.999 --> 10:18.998
- Yes. Please.
- So because I've had

10:18.999 --> 10:23.998
pregnancy issues in the past,
I'm at a specialist's office who

10:23.999 --> 10:26.998
just kind of checks for
everything a little bit deeper

10:26.999 --> 10:29.998
- than my gynecologist really can.
- So, how's the baby

10:29.999 --> 10:32.998
- doing?
- Good. A lot of movement.

10:32.999 --> 10:34.998
Okay. Good. Good.
How about weight gain?

10:34.999 --> 10:36.998
How have you done so far with
that?

10:36.999 --> 10:38.998
Well, in the last week,
I've gained ten pounds it says.

10:38.999 --> 10:41.998
I don't think we're
too concerned about that right

10:41.999 --> 10:43.998
- now.
- And for some reason, my

10:43.999 --> 10:45.998
- feet are huge.
Mm-hmm.

10:45.999 --> 10:47.998
Like, my ankles are huge.

10:47.999 --> 10:49.998
They were never like this.
But my feet are, like,

10:49.999 --> 10:51.998
- unbearable.
- And a little bit is

10:51.999 --> 10:53.998
normal, but always keep an eye
on it.

10:53.999 --> 10:55.998
- Okay.
- So, today, focus on

10:55.999 --> 10:58.998
looking at size of the baby.
It'll be interesting to see how

10:58.999 --> 11:00.998
- long this little one is.
- Yeah.

11:00.999 --> 11:05.998
Yeah. Yeah.
So...

11:05.999 --> 11:07.998
There's the head.
Beautiful profile right here.

11:07.999 --> 11:09.998
I was, like, four weeks
ahead, and it had the biggest

11:09.999 --> 11:12.998
- head, and, like...
- Well, so, if we

11:12.999 --> 11:15.998
took an overall weight, that's
ninety-fourth percentile.

11:15.999 --> 11:17.998
Okay.
Pushing the envelope there, but

11:17.999 --> 11:23.998
not abnormal.
And long legs and long arms.

11:23.999 --> 11:25.998
So we have proportionate, so...
I think that's just what we're

11:25.999 --> 11:28.998
- going for.
- You know, I think this

11:28.999 --> 11:32.998
pregnancy is way more scary to
me because of the medical issues

11:32.999 --> 11:35.998
I had before, but the doctor
said everything's fine, and I

11:35.999 --> 11:37.998
look really healthy.
And I'm just gonna try to have,

11:37.999 --> 11:39.998
like, a positive attitude and
not really worry about it as

11:39.999 --> 11:42.998
much.
I have a more calm vibe right

11:42.999 --> 11:44.998
- now, this week.
- You seem very, very

11:44.999 --> 11:46.998
- calm now.
- Yeah.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.998
- Sorry.
- So thank you so much.

11:48.999 --> 11:56.998
Okay.
You're welcome.

11:56.999 --> 11:59.998
What restaurant we are going?

11:59.999 --> 12:02.998
It's called Blue Jam Cafe.

12:02.999 --> 12:07.998
Think we went there when they
first opened a long time ago.

12:07.999 --> 12:09.998
When I was in your tummy?

12:09.999 --> 12:11.998
No, you were out of my tummy.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.998
- You were probably...
- I had tiny feet?

12:14.999 --> 12:16.998
Yeah, you had tiny feet.

12:16.999 --> 12:19.998
You remember...?

12:19.999 --> 12:22.999
Uh, here's KoKo.
Hi.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.998
- Hi.
- How was, um, party

12:25.999 --> 12:27.998
- planning?
- The planning?

12:27.999 --> 12:31.998
- Yeah.
- Um, it's good.

12:31.999 --> 12:35.998
I mean, there's just gonna be so
much more work than I expected.

12:35.999 --> 12:38.998
I mean, normally, Kim is there
to, like, help pick up the

12:38.999 --> 12:41.998
pieces and blah, blah, blah.
But now she is so pregnant, and

12:41.999 --> 12:46.998
you're not this time, so I'm
gonna need, you know, you to

12:46.999 --> 12:50.998
- kind of step it up a little bit.
- Um... okay.

12:50.999 --> 12:54.998
Kim is a very independent
person, and she isn't one to ask

12:54.999 --> 12:58.998
for help, but with her being so
pregnant, I think she just

12:58.999 --> 13:01.998
really needs to relax.
Like, anything I can do to help,

13:01.999 --> 13:04.998
then I'll do it.
But I'm happy to step in.

13:04.999 --> 13:07.998
I know how important this is.
It's annoying, because everybody

13:07.999 --> 13:13.998
is acting like I'm just never
involved, but I'm going to go

13:13.999 --> 13:15.998
above and beyond and make it
good.

13:15.999 --> 13:19.998
We haven't even done
anything yet, so, we need to

13:19.999 --> 13:21.998
really buckle down and figure
this out.

13:21.999 --> 13:23.998
- Yeah.
- Because before you

13:23.999 --> 13:25.998
know it, it's gonna be her
birthday.

13:25.999 --> 13:27.998
Exactly.
All right, well, I'm just

13:27.999 --> 13:30.998
pulling up for lunch with P.
I will step it up.

13:30.999 --> 13:34.998
- I promise, I won't disappoint.
- You rarely do, Kourt.

13:34.999 --> 13:37.999
Okay... baby.

13:45.999 --> 13:48.998
- Hey, what's up, babe?
- Hey, babe.

13:48.999 --> 13:50.998
- How was your day?
- Once I get all this

13:50.999 --> 13:54.998
stuff sorted out, I'll be so
happy.

13:54.999 --> 13:56.998
I need to talk to you
for a minute.

13:56.999 --> 13:58.998
- Yeah?
- Babe, you've been,

13:58.999 --> 14:01.998
like, working so crazy, and I'm
concerned about your stress

14:01.999 --> 14:04.998
levels.
It's one thing to be a

14:04.999 --> 14:07.998
workaholic and make all this
success and all the business,

14:07.999 --> 14:10.998
but if your ass not healthy, all
that for zero.

14:10.999 --> 14:14.998
Yeah.
I've been working like this for

14:14.999 --> 14:18.998
the last few decades.
If anyone's gonna be with me, it

14:18.999 --> 14:21.998
- kind of has to be on my terms.
- Well, do you agree

14:21.999 --> 14:23.998
with me?
Because I'm telling you, we need

14:23.999 --> 14:25.999
- to relax.
- But I can't just stop.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.999
- You know?
- Yeah, I know, but you

14:28.000 --> 14:30.998
got to take a chill pill and
just...

14:30.999 --> 14:31.999
Some days, I just have
to work until it's done, and

14:32.000 --> 14:33.998
then, the travel...
I think it's just the travel

14:33.999 --> 14:35.998
- that's killing me.
- No, you can work.

14:35.999 --> 14:37.998
You can... you can work.
You can do all your working you

14:37.999 --> 14:41.998
want, but you're always high
tension, high stress, high this,

14:41.999 --> 14:44.998
- high that, and that's not good.
- Yeah.

14:44.999 --> 14:46.998
I can't find anymore bags.

14:46.999 --> 14:48.998
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. Should we

14:48.999 --> 14:51.998
just make piles, and then find
bags later?

14:51.999 --> 14:55.998
Yeah. Yeah.
And we have to make sure that...

14:55.999 --> 14:58.998
That my woman is
relaxing in between all this

14:58.999 --> 15:00.998
hard-ass work.
- So this is gonna go in

15:00.999 --> 15:02.998
Khloe's.
We'll make a pile for Khloe, and

15:02.999 --> 15:04.998
- then, um...
- Babe, are you gonna

15:04.999 --> 15:07.998
take this conversation I had
with you seriously?

15:07.999 --> 15:11.998
Corey needs to
understand, I manage a lot of

15:11.999 --> 15:13.998
people, and he can't change
that.

15:13.999 --> 15:17.998
- It's a deal-breaker.
- Scott has gone to rehab.

15:17.999 --> 15:21.998
Well, he said, "I just want to
get it together this time."

15:21.999 --> 15:24.998
- I'm surprised he went.
- Yeah, for 30 days.

15:24.999 --> 15:27.998
Me worrying about your
stress levels and you relaxing

15:27.999 --> 15:35.999
- and everything.
- I'm not helpless!

15:41.999 --> 15:45.998
- Ow! Kourtney!
- Yeah. I took North

15:45.999 --> 15:47.998
and P to ballet today, and they
both told me they didn't want to

15:47.999 --> 15:49.998
- go.
- North will just say

15:49.999 --> 15:51.998
- whatever P says.
- Yeah.

15:51.999 --> 15:54.998
- Yeah.
- And then she called

15:54.999 --> 15:58.998
me "Mom," and then P was like,
"North, you called my mommy

15:58.999 --> 16:00.998
'Mom.'"
And then I go, "She's just

16:00.999 --> 16:02.998
pretending."
And then she goes, "I'm just

16:02.999 --> 16:05.998
pretending."
Whoever says something, she

16:05.999 --> 16:09.998
just, like, copies it.
Okay, so we're throwing Mom a

16:09.999 --> 16:11.998
- party.
- It's, like, a

16:11.999 --> 16:14.998
once-in-a-lifetime, epic, epic
party.

16:14.999 --> 16:17.998
- ♪ ♪- My sisters and I have

16:17.999 --> 16:19.998
only locked down the theme.
We have to think about the

16:19.999 --> 16:21.998
details.
Who's gonna be our deejay?

16:21.999 --> 16:25.998
Are we having performers?
Like, what's an extra ta-da at

16:25.999 --> 16:27.998
the party?
She's had, like, the craziest

16:27.999 --> 16:29.998
year.
It's almost like her coming-out

16:29.999 --> 16:32.998
- party-slash-birthday.
- We should screen

16:32.999 --> 16:34.998
her "I love my friends" video
at the party.

16:34.999 --> 16:36.998
- ♪ ♪- Why don't we redo

16:36.999 --> 16:37.999
- her...
- 30 years later.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.998
Why don't we redo her
"I love my friends"?

16:39.999 --> 16:40.999
Oh, we don't have the time.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.998
- Are you joking?
- It's, like, five

16:42.999 --> 16:44.998
- minutes, and then we should...
- Google "I love my

16:44.999 --> 16:47.998
friends"... let's Google it.
When my mom turned 30, her and

16:47.999 --> 16:51.998
my dad made this epic video
honoring and cherishing all of

16:51.999 --> 16:53.998
her friends.
Like, this has been a video that

16:53.999 --> 16:55.998
we've cherished our entire
lives, literally.

16:55.999 --> 16:59.998
And how dope would it be to now
have the modern-day version?

16:59.999 --> 17:01.998
Like, she will flip.
Who's writing this song?

17:01.999 --> 17:03.998
So now we're changing all the
words.

17:03.999 --> 17:04.999
- Yes, we are.
- Yeah, we have to.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.998
But who's writing it?
Kanye?

17:06.999 --> 17:07.999
- I will.
- No.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.998
Instead of lots of tennis?

17:09.999 --> 17:12.998
Lots of orgies.
Lots of blow jobs.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.998
I feel like we should
take up carpooling, 'cause no

17:14.999 --> 17:16.998
one carpools.
Our kids aren't even in school.

17:16.999 --> 17:17.999
- Yeah.
- I'm calling Kendall

17:18.000 --> 17:19.998
- right now.
- Make sure Mom isn't

17:19.999 --> 17:21.998
- there.
- Sister!

17:21.999 --> 17:24.998
Sister!
Are you with Mom?

17:24.999 --> 17:27.998
Look who I'm with!

17:27.999 --> 17:30.998
Hey, listen, Kendall.
We're doing this video for Mom

17:30.999 --> 17:32.998
for her 60th birthday.
We're gonna re-create that

17:32.999 --> 17:35.998
video.
We need Karl, we need everyone

17:35.999 --> 17:38.998
you can possibly imagine to just
say, "She loves you."

17:38.999 --> 17:40.998
- Will you do that?
- Yes, I'll do it.

17:40.999 --> 17:41.999
- We need you.
- We're gonna send you

17:42.000 --> 17:43.998
the reference.
Bye.

17:43.999 --> 17:45.998
- Okay, love you. Bye.
- Love you. Bye.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.998
She's not paying
attention to us right now.

17:47.999 --> 17:49.998
I know, but she will.
Trust me.

17:49.999 --> 17:51.998
We all need to contribute to
this video.

17:51.999 --> 17:54.998
We have to call all of her
friends, we have to find photos,

17:54.999 --> 17:56.998
we have to film things
ourself...

17:56.999 --> 17:59.998
It's such a last-minute decision
to do this, so we're all gonna

17:59.999 --> 18:01.998
- have to put in a lot of work.
- Do you know how dope

18:01.999 --> 18:03.998
this would be if we actually did
something Dad made for Mom and

18:03.999 --> 18:05.998
- now we're doing it ourselves?
- Yeah.

18:05.999 --> 18:07.998
This is a good start, guys.

18:07.999 --> 18:08.999
You need to get into this.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.999
- I'm gonna do it.
- But be into it?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.998
Why wouldn't I?

18:13.999 --> 18:16.998
- You talk like this all the time.
- Khloe, my singing

18:16.999 --> 18:18.998
is different.
"Khloe, my

18:18.999 --> 18:20.998
singing is different."
Don't make me kick

18:20.999 --> 18:21.999
- you in the face.
- "Don't make me kick

18:22.000 --> 18:23.998
you in the face."

18:23.999 --> 18:25.998
- You guys...
- So, you just got

18:25.999 --> 18:26.999
- kicked in the face.
- You just have to say

18:27.000 --> 18:30.999
- it like normal... Oh!
- Perfect.

18:36.999 --> 18:38.998
Do you want to sit, so
you don't...

18:38.999 --> 18:43.998
Yeah, I really do,
'cause my, uh... body gives out

18:43.999 --> 18:48.998
on me.
On that note, have you heard

18:48.999 --> 18:53.998
that Scott has gone to rehab?
He came here... I just, like, had

18:53.999 --> 18:55.998
no idea he was here.
And he was like, "Hey, I came by

18:55.999 --> 18:57.998
to see your mom."
And, like, we sat and talked

18:57.999 --> 19:00.998
for, like, 30 minutes and it was
like, he was normal.

19:00.999 --> 19:04.998
So I walk in the kitchen and run
into Scott and I had no idea

19:04.999 --> 19:07.998
that he was dropping by.
He wants to really get it

19:07.999 --> 19:10.998
together and wants to go to
rehab for a long time and I

19:10.999 --> 19:13.998
think that it all sounds
amazing.

19:13.999 --> 19:15.998
I just hope that he sticks with
it.

19:15.999 --> 19:17.998
Well, he's like, "I'm eight days
sober and I just want to, you

19:17.999 --> 19:21.998
know, really get it together
this time, like, for my kids."

19:21.999 --> 19:23.998
- That's good.
- Yeah, it was, like,

19:23.999 --> 19:26.998
- really positive.
- I hope he stays and

19:26.999 --> 19:29.998
actually, like, does the
treatment.

19:29.999 --> 19:31.998
Mm-hmm.
- I am surprised that

19:31.999 --> 19:34.998
Scott has gone to rehab, just
because I feel like I was just

19:34.999 --> 19:36.998
hearing he was on the streets
partying.

19:36.999 --> 19:39.998
- Kourt knows, right?
- Yeah.

19:39.999 --> 19:41.998
How does she feel?
I haven't... she hasn't said

19:41.999 --> 19:42.999
- anything to me.
- I mean, I think she's,

19:43.000 --> 19:44.998
like, been really distant from
him and just, like, wants to

19:44.999 --> 19:46.998
- keep her distance.
- She's over it.

19:46.999 --> 19:48.998
So I think she'll be,
like, proud of him and, like,

19:48.999 --> 19:50.998
- hoping for the best.
- I'm surprised he went.

19:50.999 --> 19:51.999
Yeah.
For 30 days, so hopefully he

19:52.000 --> 19:53.999
- stays.
- He should stay longer

19:54.000 --> 19:56.998
than 30 days.
Do I want to have a positive

19:56.999 --> 19:59.998
outlook on everything and hope
for the best?

19:59.999 --> 20:01.998
Yeah.
Scott has gone to rehab so many

20:01.999 --> 20:03.998
times.
So who knows?

20:03.999 --> 20:06.998
This time, he hopefully will
stay and it will work.

20:06.999 --> 20:08.998
But that's the part
about life, is we have no

20:08.999 --> 20:10.999
- guarantees.
- Isn't it crazy just to

20:11.000 --> 20:12.999
think, like, God, where will we
be in a year?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.998
I can't handle much
more, so there better be

20:15.999 --> 20:19.998
fairies and unicorns in a year.
'Cause I can't handle much more.

20:19.999 --> 20:22.998
I'm gonna go to rehab just to
chill out for a second.

20:22.999 --> 20:24.998
You really look like Kim.

20:24.999 --> 20:27.998
Kanye threw this
surprise party together and I

20:27.999 --> 20:33.998
- think Kim is going to love it.
- Here we go.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.998
Scott sent me an
e-mail today... and just said,

20:36.999 --> 20:44.999
like, "I'd love to see you."
I haven't responded.

responded.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.998
Lamar Odom fights
for his life at a Las Vegas

Hey, Mom.

- How was the

21:26.999 --> 21:29.998
transfer to L.A.?

21:29.999 --> 21:31.998
It was like I felt,
like, helpless.

21:31.999 --> 21:37.999
- It was really crazy.
Mm-hmm.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.998
- ♪ ♪- I'm so overwhelmed with

21:41.999 --> 21:45.998
what's going on with Lamar.
It's heartbreaking...

21:45.999 --> 21:49.998
heartbreaking.
I don't think I've ever felt so

21:49.999 --> 21:53.998
powerless and it makes me
really, really sad.

21:53.999 --> 21:56.998
First of all, we had to find a
helicopter that was big enough

21:56.999 --> 21:58.998
- for him.
Mm-hmm.

21:58.999 --> 22:01.998
'Cause he's so tall.
Once they secured that, we took

22:01.999 --> 22:03.998
- him upstairs, on the roof...
Mm-hmm.

22:03.999 --> 22:05.998
Put him into the
helicopter and then I was

22:05.999 --> 22:07.998
sitting in the car, waiting to
hear...

22:07.999 --> 22:09.998
You know, when they took off.

22:09.999 --> 22:11.998
And as soon as they went back up
into the air...

22:11.999 --> 22:13.998
Mm-hmm.
- I raced to the

22:13.999 --> 22:16.998
airport, took off, landed before
they did.

22:16.999 --> 22:19.998
So I got to Cedars, I met all
the doctors... everyone showed up

22:19.999 --> 22:22.998
in the middle of the night.
You know, we got him settled and

22:22.999 --> 22:26.998
- then, um, I went home.
- Yeah.

22:26.999 --> 22:28.998
I'm gonna go back this
afternoon.

22:28.999 --> 22:31.998
See what Khloe needs.
Take her some fresh clothes.

22:31.999 --> 22:33.998
Hopefully, she'll get her hair
washed.

22:33.999 --> 22:37.998
Yeah.
I feel, like, relieved that he's

22:37.999 --> 22:39.998
- here.
- Yeah, I do, too.

22:39.999 --> 22:43.998
You know?
I think that Khloe is less

22:43.999 --> 22:46.998
stressed out because she's here
and she can be at the hospital

22:46.999 --> 22:48.998
every day and maybe still sleep
at home.

22:48.999 --> 22:50.998
Well, I don't think
she was leaving his side.

22:50.999 --> 22:52.998
She would have never left.

22:52.999 --> 22:53.999
Right, that's what
I'm saying, so...

22:54.000 --> 22:56.998
Yeah. Yeah.
It's better.

22:56.999 --> 22:59.999
Khloe has been
spending every second in the

23:00.000 --> 23:04.998
hospital with Lamar, by his
side, and she feels guilty for

23:04.999 --> 23:09.998
needing to leave, even if it's,
you know, to take a shower.

23:09.999 --> 23:13.998
Right now, they have to
stabilize all of his organs.

23:13.999 --> 23:16.998
And they want to do another MRI,
they want to make sure that the

23:16.999 --> 23:19.998
- dialysis is under control...
- Yeah.

23:19.999 --> 23:23.998
'Cause the strokes are,
you know, debilitating and they

23:23.999 --> 23:28.998
don't know yet how he's gonna...
respond to all of it.

23:28.999 --> 23:31.998
Mm-hmm.
- But I think just him

23:31.999 --> 23:36.998
hearing our voices and seeing us
and having family around is

23:36.999 --> 23:41.999
healthy and might make a
difference.

24:29.999 --> 24:33.998
everybody to dress like Kim.
I put on a fake baby bump, so

24:33.999 --> 24:36.998
that she felt more comfortable,
and I think Kim is going to love

24:36.999 --> 24:39.998

conscious?

24:52.999 --> 24:54.998
He's in and out, right now.

But he had dialysis for, like,
six hours and now that everybody

24:59.999 --> 25:02.998

28:34.999 --> 28:36.998
hand, I don't know if that
decision's been made, you know,

28:36.999 --> 28:40.998
because they came to the
hospital room, and they served

28:40.999 --> 28:45.998

middle of, like, his dialysis

28:45.999 --> 28:47.998

know, "He's having a procedure
right now.

Khloe has decided to not

call somebody in the DA's office
in Nevada.

She has been by Lamar's
side, and Lamar isn't really in

29:04.999 --> 29:07.998
a place where he can really make
these important decisions, so I

29:07.999 --> 29:11.998
think that it's just the best
decision for Khloe to make the

29:11.999 --> 29:15.998
best medical decisions for
Lamar.

41:06.999 --> 41:08.998
average singers?
Like, you know how there's

41:08.999 --> 41:10.998
usually one really, one that
sings so good, but we're just,

41:10.999 --> 41:12.998
- like, all really bad singers?
- We sound good

41:12.999 --> 41:13.999
- together.
- Like, who's the

41:14.000 --> 41:15.998
Beyoncé, guys?
We all know it's me.

41:15.999 --> 41:17.998
I feel like you think
think it's you.

41:17.999 --> 41:19.998
She enjoys it the most.

41:19.999 --> 41:23.998
Khloe's the deep,
down and dirty voice.

41:23.999 --> 41:26.998
Khloe has just been
trying to be at the hospital as

41:26.999 --> 41:29.998
much as she can.
And this song, you know, is so

41:29.999 --> 41:34.998
minimal compared to what she's
going through, but I know she's,

41:34.999 --> 41:37.998
like, having a major case of
FOMO.

41:37.999 --> 41:42.998
She loves you guys!

41:42.999 --> 41:44.998
- We're so good.
- Okay, does Kourtney

41:44.999 --> 41:46.998
want to sing a solo?
'Cause it seems like that's what

41:46.999 --> 41:48.998
- she wants to do.
- No, but I'm saying

41:48.999 --> 41:50.998
- is this even gonna sound good?
- Yes, it's gonna sound

41:50.999 --> 41:52.998
- good.
- It also doesn't need

41:52.999 --> 41:54.998
- to sound like real singers.
- Yeah, it's so funny.

41:54.999 --> 41:56.998
Should we have done
that one part one more time?

41:56.999 --> 41:58.998
Are we gonna listen
to it or something?

41:58.999 --> 42:00.998
- Sure.
- I think we should.

42:00.999 --> 42:03.998
Here it comes.

42:03.999 --> 42:07.998
- So funny.
- We sound horrendous

42:07.999 --> 42:10.998
altogether.
I think Kim and I have really

42:10.999 --> 42:14.998
similar voices.
And Kendall and Kylie, theirs

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
are just, like, deeper than
ours.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.998
I'll walk out with
you, because I got to go, too.

42:19.999 --> 42:22.998
I don't know.
It... We're not like a harmony,

42:22.999 --> 42:25.998
- like, singing group.
- Bye, thank you!

42:25.999 --> 42:27.998
All right, want to
check it out from...?

42:27.999 --> 42:29.998
It sounds so much
better when you and I are

42:29.999 --> 42:31.998
- singing it.
- Here we go.

42:31.999 --> 42:34.998
So let's just do the
whole thing just you and me.

42:34.999 --> 42:36.998
I swear to God we
need to, I'm telling you.

42:36.999 --> 42:39.998
- That's what I was telling you.
- Ours is, like, a hundred

42:39.999 --> 42:41.998
times better.
That's

42:41.999 --> 42:44.998
what I told you!
That's why!

42:44.999 --> 42:46.998
Let's re-sing it.

42:46.999 --> 42:49.998
I think there's no option.

42:49.999 --> 42:52.998
Kim and I have to re-record this
song, because it just sounds

42:52.999 --> 42:55.998
awful.
And don't tell anyone.

42:55.999 --> 42:58.998
I almost feel bad, but,
like, Khloe won't have to feel

42:58.999 --> 43:01.998
guilty.
She's not the only one that

43:01.999 --> 43:04.998
isn't a part of this song.
We didn't even need them here.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.998
We could've had
Kendall and Kylie do one verse

43:06.999 --> 43:09.998
together, because I bet their
voices sound more alike.

43:09.999 --> 43:11.998
No, because then the
whole song is gonna be like,

43:11.999 --> 43:13.998
And then

43:13.999 --> 43:15.998
'Cause they really have manly
voices.

43:15.999 --> 43:17.998
Crazy.
Who knew?

43:17.999 --> 43:20.998
- On the next episode...
- This looks insane!

43:20.999 --> 43:23.998
- Happy birthday!
- Incredible!

43:23.999 --> 43:26.998
My mom has never had a
party be all about her.

43:26.999 --> 43:28.998
This is my first time having
alcohol in four weeks.

43:28.999 --> 43:31.998
Kris Jenner.
You're about to get your panties

43:31.999 --> 43:34.998
moist, girl.
I just, like,

43:34.999 --> 43:39.998
- don't know what to do about T.
- She's working at

43:39.999 --> 43:41.998
- Victoria's Secret.
- The attention is not

43:41.999 --> 43:43.998
gonna be on you for one second.
You can't come!

43:43.999 --> 43:46.999
