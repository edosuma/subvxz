To protect my agency from

02:53.019 --> 02:54.320
To that end, in the late '80s,

02:54.387 --> 02:57.055
we staged a cyber-attack
on the O.M.B.

02:57.123 --> 03:00.025
Its purpose was to siphon
small amounts of money

03:00.092 --> 03:02.294
from all other
government entities.

03:02.362 --> 03:05.531
We scanned
the entire federal budget

03:05.598 --> 03:09.802
and rerouted tiny amounts of
funding to a black-box account.

03:09.869 --> 03:12.705

and only I controlled.

to get at that account,

03:26.552 --> 03:27.719
how would they go about it?

03:28.455 --> 03:30.855

41:56.318 --> 41:58.586
Just call command.

41:59.788 --> 42:01.255
<i>[ Tone plays ]</i>

42:01.323 --> 42:03.257
<i>Operator: We're sorry.
You have reached a number</i>

42:03.325 --> 42:06.160
<i>that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.</i>

42:06.227 --> 42:07.828
I know we haven't had

42:07.896 --> 42:09.466
a lot to celebrate around here
in the last few months.

42:09.533 --> 42:13.133
Sometimes, it seems
the battles weren't winnable,

42:13.134 --> 42:15.770
or at least not worth
- the blood spilled fighting them,

42:15.837 --> 42:18.439
but then a moment
like this comes around,

42:18.507 --> 42:20.808
and it makes you feel
like it's all worth it,

42:20.875 --> 42:23.143
that we're finally
stepping back into the light.

42:25.479 --> 42:28.115
We did this, people.
We made this happen.

42:28.183 --> 42:29.316
Gladiators.

42:29.383 --> 42:31.384
[ Laughs ]
Harrison: Hear, hear.

42:31.452 --> 42:33.520
Olivia: [ Gags, gasps ]

42:33.587 --> 42:35.789
What the hell have you done?!

42:38.125 --> 42:39.892
[ Strained ] I don't know
what you're talking about.

42:39.960 --> 42:43.429
No? Then let me be the one
who breaks it to you.

42:43.496 --> 42:44.997
You just killed the president.
