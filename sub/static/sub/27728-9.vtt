<i>Previously on</i>
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.737 --> 00:05.212
Welcome to Project
Shepherd. For the past 70 years,

00:05.289 --> 00:06.663
your ancestors and mine have led
an operation to protect

00:06.740 --> 00:08.457
this entire planet.

00:08.533 --> 00:11.001
<i>You're gonna request
a transfer out of Roswell.</i>

00:11.078 --> 00:13.295
If you ever come back,
I will alert the Pentagon.

00:13.371 --> 00:14.722
<i>I'm going out of town.</i>

00:14.798 --> 00:17.766
I need you to be my eyes
and ears while I'm gone.

00:17.843 --> 00:20.510
Liz, I have loved you
my entire life.

00:20.587 --> 00:25.390
You destroyed
my sister to save yours!

00:25.401 --> 00:27.768
Isobel's having blackouts.
She's dangerous.

00:27.844 --> 00:29.561
- Something has to be done.
<i>- They can keep you here</i>

00:29.572 --> 00:32.564
on a temporary psych hold
for a little while.

00:32.575 --> 00:34.649
These are the samples
you collected from me.

00:34.726 --> 00:36.735
I was trying to create a serum
that would mute your powers.

00:36.746 --> 00:38.579
<i>A few hours ago,</i>

00:38.655 --> 00:39.988
everything was fine with
Isobel's blood sample,

00:39.999 --> 00:41.915
but suddenly,
something has changed.

00:41.992 --> 00:43.399
At the current rate
of degeneration,

00:43.477 --> 00:46.078
<i>Isobel will be dead
by the end of the day.</i>

00:46.154 --> 00:47.245
You created this stuff.

00:47.322 --> 00:49.089
You can create the antidote.

00:49.166 --> 00:50.415
<i>Max showed you our pods, right?</i>

00:50.426 --> 00:51.958
<i>If this liquid</i>

00:51.969 --> 00:54.419
<i>kept you in stasis,
not aging for 50 years,</i>

00:54.430 --> 00:55.763
<i>then that's exactly
what we need.</i>

01:09.302 --> 01:11.278
<i>"no one can feel more deeply
than he does</i>

01:11.355 --> 01:12.729
<i>"the beauties of nature.</i>

01:25.202 --> 01:29.412
"Such a man has a double
existence: he may suffer misery,

01:29.489 --> 01:31.873
"and be overwhelmed
by disappointments;

01:31.950 --> 01:34.126

01:34.136 --> 01:36.294
"he will be
like a celestial spirit

01:36.305 --> 01:38.046
"that has a halo around him,

01:38.123 --> 01:41.258
<i>within whose circle no grief
or folly ventures."</i>

01:46.107 --> 01:49.057
What do you think the odds
are antidote number 148

01:49.134 --> 01:51.101
is our lucky number?

01:58.810 --> 02:01.236
<i>We haven't given up
on you, Isobel.</i>

02:01.313 --> 02:04.072
<i>We never will.</i>

02:10.155 --> 02:11.288
I'm sure
that there's an explanation

02:11.364 --> 02:12.581
for this, Mr. Bracken.

02:12.657 --> 02:15.125
An explanation?

02:15.202 --> 02:17.669
My wife is missing, Sheriff.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.681
Max says she's in rehab,
but won't tell me where.

02:20.757 --> 02:22.132
He says she needs privacy.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.851
But it's been well over 28 days,

02:23.927 --> 02:26.178
and Isobel has been planning
the gala for the grand reopening

02:26.188 --> 02:27.596
of the UFO Emporium all year.

02:27.672 --> 02:29.264
There's no way she'd miss it.

02:29.341 --> 02:30.515
Okay, well, Deputy Evans

02:30.526 --> 02:33.018
is off duty today,
but I can call him in.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.645
This town is counting
on the influx of tourism

02:35.722 --> 02:37.531
the museum opening will bring.

02:37.608 --> 02:40.525
But young blondes who vanish
into thin air get attention.

02:40.536 --> 02:45.038
If I don't hear from her in 48
hours, I'm going to the press.

02:45.115 --> 02:47.616
And if I were you,
Sheriff, I'd treat Max

02:47.692 --> 02:49.034
as a suspect in this case.

02:49.044 --> 02:52.337
Whatever explanation he offers,
question it.

02:58.411 --> 03:00.220
How's your mom?

03:00.297 --> 03:02.389
Uh, she keeps ranting about the
sex scandal in the White House.

03:02.466 --> 03:04.141
Which one?

03:04.218 --> 03:05.893
Lewinsky. She thinks it's 1998.

03:05.969 --> 03:07.844
And she doesn't recognize me,

03:07.921 --> 03:08.896
because I was seven.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.390
Tequila or whiskey?

03:12.401 --> 03:14.067
Ooh...

03:14.144 --> 03:16.069
Whatever's cheaper.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.650
You lost the crutch.

03:21.726 --> 03:23.652
Yeah. It was
slowing me down.

03:23.728 --> 03:25.362
Mm. Oh, you don't
have to leave.

03:25.438 --> 03:26.580
I was on my way out.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.124
Hey.

03:31.495 --> 03:33.128
Is this really how it ends?

03:34.614 --> 03:35.756
Sex was epic.

03:37.450 --> 03:39.751
So shouldn't the breakup
involve some pyrotechnics?

03:39.762 --> 03:41.637
Scream? Break some stuff?

03:43.081 --> 03:45.182
Really make it feel over.

03:47.585 --> 03:50.562
Sometimes the world ends
with a whimper, Guerin.

03:56.353 --> 04:00.614
So I was thinking
maybe we flip a coin.

04:00.691 --> 04:03.784
Heads, it's on the house;
tails, I'll pay for it.

04:03.860 --> 04:05.619
Your tab's cleared, anyway.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.248
You know I don't need your charity.
It's not charity.

04:18.325 --> 04:20.750
It's an exchange.
My car's acting up again.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.469
You need a new engine.

04:22.546 --> 04:23.679
What I need is a ride.

04:25.215 --> 04:27.349
To Texas.
A faith healer?

04:27.426 --> 04:29.551
Mm-hmm.
Max, Isobel's organs are failing.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.636
Thoughts and prayers
won't save her liver.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.388
I've been looking
for information

04:33.465 --> 04:35.974
about this symbol for weeks
and came up with nada.

04:35.985 --> 04:38.819
And then today, my reverse
image search found this.

04:38.895 --> 04:41.813
The traveling show stops
outside McLean tomorrow.

04:41.824 --> 04:44.316
And this woman, Arizona,
claims to have the power to heal

04:44.326 --> 04:45.659
in her right hand.

04:50.857 --> 04:53.908
You think this crack's one of us.
I don't know.

04:53.985 --> 04:55.168
But I think she's the first
person we've encountered

04:55.245 --> 04:56.411
that might know something.

04:56.488 --> 04:59.339
You said this symbol
might be a beacon.

04:59.416 --> 05:01.174
Let's heed the call.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.088
Wow. Having Guerin
around as your lab rat

05:07.165 --> 05:09.174
yielded some real progress.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.350
Hey.

05:10.427 --> 05:11.885
Where are the actual lab rats?

05:11.961 --> 05:13.261
Uh, in the freezer.

05:13.338 --> 05:14.896
Dr. Avila and I
sacrificed them yesterday.

05:16.841 --> 05:18.600
Your casual blurring
of the lines

05:18.676 --> 05:20.435
between science experiment
and satanic rituals

05:20.512 --> 05:21.820
concerns me, Liz.

05:21.897 --> 05:24.272
So, when do you plan

05:24.349 --> 05:26.358
to actually administer
the antidote to Isobel?

05:26.368 --> 05:28.076
I have to wait,

05:28.153 --> 05:30.320
see if there's any degradation
over the next 36 hours.

05:30.397 --> 05:33.031
And then you'll administer it.

05:33.042 --> 05:35.825
Liz, you can't leave her
in that pod forever.

05:35.902 --> 05:38.661
We don't put people in eggs,
no matter how much she sucks. I know that.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.339
This is so much easier
with rats.

05:42.084 --> 05:44.459
It took me a long time
to learn that most times,

05:44.536 --> 05:46.503
when I call time of death
for a patient,

05:46.579 --> 05:48.055
it's not because I killed them.

05:48.131 --> 05:49.881
It's because I couldn't
save them.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.508
There's a difference.

05:51.584 --> 05:54.394
I only have one shot,

05:54.471 --> 05:56.096
and it has to be perfect.

05:56.172 --> 05:57.722
Once we take her
out of the pod, her organs

05:57.733 --> 05:59.566
are gonna... Nope, nope.
I refuse to concede.

05:59.643 --> 06:01.518
Because <i> Die Hard</i> is not
a frickin' Christmas movie.

06:01.594 --> 06:03.820
Huh?
Uh, Maria will back me on this.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.740
Oh, sorry. Hans Gruber
is undeniably the Grinch.

06:06.817 --> 06:08.116
It's like I don't
know you at all.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.861
I got to go.
Mm-hmm.

06:11.938 --> 06:14.364
What'd I tell you about
working on Saturdays?

06:14.441 --> 06:16.157
Ah, workaholism
is a disease, Maria.

06:16.234 --> 06:18.159
Please, be sensitive
to my plight.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.379
How are you?

06:20.455 --> 06:22.464
Honestly? Not awesome.

06:23.801 --> 06:25.166
Mom's getting much worse.

06:25.243 --> 06:27.260
Okay, I'm gonna make a call.

06:27.337 --> 06:29.262
There is a drug trial
happening at UCLA...

06:29.339 --> 06:31.589
No, I didn't come for a
doctor, or a scientist.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.184
I need your help
with another option.

06:41.110 --> 06:44.060
Ooh! Tennessee plates,

06:44.137 --> 06:45.854
New York plates.

06:45.930 --> 06:49.190
These people are real desperate.

06:49.267 --> 06:50.483
Yep.
Oh, crap.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.868
What?

06:51.945 --> 06:53.787
New Mexico plates.

07:06.618 --> 07:08.385
Max.

07:19.148 --> 07:22.098
There a problem, Officer?
Right, flashing the Air Force I.D.

07:22.175 --> 07:25.435
Because cops don't give speeding
tickets to combat vets.

07:25.512 --> 07:28.155
After all, you did serve two
tours with the highest-regarded

07:28.231 --> 07:31.232
air expeditionary group,
and you were recommended

07:31.309 --> 07:33.985
for the Air Force Medal and the
Air Force Cross, and that was

07:33.996 --> 07:36.404
before your injury... something
your dad should be proud of...

07:36.481 --> 07:39.282
except all three of your
brothers have medals, too.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.335
How fast was I going?

07:42.412 --> 07:45.121
My name is Jenna Cameron.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.665
And I pulled you over
because I need your help.

07:47.676 --> 07:52.012
Your father has asked me to
report any strange activity

07:52.088 --> 07:54.014
in town to him.

07:54.090 --> 07:56.007
Something strange has come up,

07:56.018 --> 08:00.395
but, uh, I don't think
he's the right Manes to tell.

08:08.772 --> 08:10.939
- You following me?
- No.

08:11.015 --> 08:12.491
I try to stay
upwind of you, Guerin.

08:12.567 --> 08:14.484
Oh. Well, just
let me know

08:14.561 --> 08:15.869
next time, DeLuca, and we won't

08:15.946 --> 08:17.395
have to take two cars.
Oh, I don't usually

08:17.397 --> 08:20.490
go for the guy whose only friend
is his parole officer.

08:20.567 --> 08:21.824
Usually.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.284
I'm gonna get some lemonade.

08:23.361 --> 08:24.336
Sounds refreshing.

08:36.624 --> 08:38.633
Thank you, everyone, thank you.

08:38.644 --> 08:40.301
My name is Arizona.

08:40.378 --> 08:42.511
Some of you are true believers.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.681
Some of you came
to prove me wrong.

08:44.757 --> 08:47.058
But the sky spirit sees all.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.643
And today,

08:48.654 --> 08:50.695
she calls for...

08:56.227 --> 08:58.119
...you.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.372
You're a skeptic, aren't you?

09:09.449 --> 09:10.924
A seeker of the truth.

09:11.001 --> 09:12.834
But your pain is not your truth.

09:12.910 --> 09:15.428
One day, your body will turn
into the sun and the moon.

09:16.914 --> 09:19.048
The sky spirit already
lives in you.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.267
Close your eyes.

09:35.266 --> 09:36.825
It is done.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.623
<i>So, what?</i>

09:51.633 --> 09:53.249
You think she's like us?

09:53.326 --> 09:54.709
We're not the only three
who survived the crash?

09:54.786 --> 09:57.137
No. But it's not impossible.

09:57.213 --> 10:00.098
Maybe there were more pods,
or she came in a different ship.

10:00.175 --> 10:02.383
I say we ambush her in her
private little tepee thing.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.385
We'll corner her
till she coughs up the truth.

10:04.462 --> 10:06.554
Dude, no. We can't go at her
guns blazing.

10:06.631 --> 10:07.764
You literally hate everything

10:07.840 --> 10:09.766
that I love.
Look, when I use my hand

10:09.842 --> 10:12.602
to heal, I get sick,
lights go crazy.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.395
Hey, if she's like us,
she's a lot stronger than I am.

10:14.472 --> 10:16.314
She's more controlled,
so let's make sure

10:16.325 --> 10:20.035
she's an ally before we do
anything that can expose us.

10:23.406 --> 10:25.657
She's doing
private consultations.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.241
What are you gonna
ask her to heal?

10:27.318 --> 10:29.169
Your wounded heart?

10:34.325 --> 10:36.084
So, what's going on?

10:41.925 --> 10:44.842
Your dad gave me this file
six weeks ago,

10:44.853 --> 10:48.805
and wanted me to report any
similar deaths directly to him.

10:48.881 --> 10:51.015
Handprint-related deaths.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.526
You see that tattoo?

10:53.603 --> 10:56.312
I cross-referenced police files
for the identifying mark.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.532
That was a teenage prostitute
who was killed in 2011,

10:59.609 --> 11:00.942
found in a shallow grave
somewhere south

11:01.018 --> 11:02.193
of Cowboy Ruckus.

11:02.204 --> 11:03.361
But in the official autopsy,

11:03.372 --> 11:04.612
the handprint's not mentioned.

11:04.689 --> 11:06.864
That's strange.
The medical examiner

11:06.875 --> 11:08.783
who signed off is Jane Holden.

11:08.860 --> 11:12.537
In ten years, she's done 14
autopsies for Roswell PD.

11:12.547 --> 11:17.208
All homeless people, addicts
and illegal immigrants.

11:17.219 --> 11:19.293
So, all people that wouldn't
be missed by the system.

11:19.370 --> 11:20.503
Almost all.

11:20.514 --> 11:23.131
The first of 14, Rosa Ortecho.

11:23.207 --> 11:25.341
I've been in this town
long enough

11:25.418 --> 11:27.394
to know that people noticed
she was gone.

11:27.470 --> 11:29.688
You think there's
a conspiracy here.

11:31.215 --> 11:32.357
Why did you bring this to me?

11:32.434 --> 11:36.894
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.564
And since your dad blackmailed
me to surveil you,

11:39.574 --> 11:42.492
I think we're gonna be besties.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.414
<i>Welcome.</i>

11:47.490 --> 11:49.416
What can the sky spirit
do for you?

11:49.492 --> 11:51.492
Uh...

11:51.569 --> 11:53.870
I still want to try
the whole rock star thing

11:53.946 --> 11:56.589
before I'm 30, so...

11:56.666 --> 11:58.425
This is a terrible injury.

11:58.501 --> 12:02.378
To heal this, you'll have to
reopen the wound in your mind.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.214
All the pain you've
hidden there.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.340
It won't be easy.

12:06.417 --> 12:09.051
But it's... possible.

12:09.128 --> 12:10.520
Yes.

12:12.965 --> 12:14.515
But for an injury

12:14.592 --> 12:17.935
this extensive,

12:17.946 --> 12:20.113
it'll be 8,000.
Dollars?

12:20.190 --> 12:22.315
We don't have that kind of cash.

12:22.391 --> 12:23.241
Nobody has that kind of cash.

12:26.121 --> 12:29.456
The sky spirit understands.

12:29.532 --> 12:30.915
Thank you for coming.

12:35.613 --> 12:37.130
How do you sleep at night,

12:37.207 --> 12:38.706
turning people away knowing that

12:38.717 --> 12:40.917
your friggin' sky spirit
can save them?

12:40.993 --> 12:45.013
Judging by the grease on your
jeans, you're a mechanic, right?

12:46.850 --> 12:48.141
You do that for free?

12:56.801 --> 12:58.651
So?

12:58.728 --> 13:00.144
Alien vibes?

13:00.155 --> 13:01.896
Or you think the sky
spirit's a real thing?

13:01.973 --> 13:03.439
Well, what's your
scientific hypothesis?

13:03.516 --> 13:04.491
That there's no science here.

13:06.018 --> 13:07.819
If I were the hoping kind...
Which you're not.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.947
But if I were...

13:11.023 --> 13:15.743
I'd hope it was an
old-fashioned miracle.

13:15.820 --> 13:17.837
Evidence that there's a plan.

13:17.914 --> 13:19.672
That God exists,
and that he won't let us

13:19.749 --> 13:20.840
screw things up too badly.

13:20.917 --> 13:22.834
I think the whole
point of God is to

13:22.910 --> 13:24.469
believe without evidence.

13:26.089 --> 13:27.922
Max, I'm healed!

13:27.999 --> 13:29.849
Seriously?

13:29.926 --> 13:30.842
No.

13:30.918 --> 13:32.051
Come on, dude.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.177
She knew I was a mechanic

13:33.188 --> 13:34.637
from the state of my pants.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.190
So she said some magical BS,
and she quoted us a price

13:37.267 --> 13:39.234
that she knew I couldn't
afford in a million years.

13:41.012 --> 13:42.770
But you guys saw the man
with the limp.

13:42.847 --> 13:45.865
I just... I have this
feeling. I believe her.

13:45.942 --> 13:48.609
That feeling, DeLuca,
is naivete.

13:48.686 --> 13:51.028
You want to believe her, babe.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.705
Yeah.

13:52.782 --> 13:55.208
I mean, I admire
your faith in people.

13:55.285 --> 13:56.701
I even envy it, but...

13:56.777 --> 13:58.670
you need that money.

14:02.366 --> 14:03.716
The woman behind the curtain.

14:03.793 --> 14:05.260
Michael.

14:09.582 --> 14:10.849
That's the guy with the limp.

14:13.002 --> 14:14.302
He's an actor.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.562
She's a fraud.

14:18.474 --> 14:20.808
DeLuca, where you going?

14:20.885 --> 14:22.735
To a bar. Obviously.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.147
Max. Max!

14:26.223 --> 14:27.982
Hey.

14:28.059 --> 14:29.191
Sir, there's a line.

14:29.268 --> 14:30.359
I have a few questions.

14:30.436 --> 14:33.246
This is so not your
jurisdiction.

14:33.323 --> 14:35.698
So call the cops.
Is this a game to you,

14:35.775 --> 14:36.916
conning innocent people?

14:36.993 --> 14:38.826
I've committed no crime.

14:38.837 --> 14:39.744
Except fraud.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.579
Sick people risk their health

14:41.590 --> 14:44.749
and travel hundreds of miles,
and you, what, laugh it off?

14:44.759 --> 14:46.334
Spin some crap about spirits,

14:46.410 --> 14:48.803
and steal the hard-earned
money of people

14:48.880 --> 14:50.004
with medical bills to pay?

14:54.877 --> 14:56.895
You're a hack.

15:00.091 --> 15:03.225
Just give me one honest answer.

15:03.302 --> 15:04.435
What is this?

15:04.512 --> 15:06.562
I don't know.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.397
You're gonna spend two nights
in county and a year in court.

15:08.474 --> 15:09.565
That's gonna be bad
for business.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.567
Why do you care about
some clip art?

15:11.644 --> 15:13.569
- It's just something I saw.
- And stole.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.072
Hijacking important iconography
for personal gain.

15:16.148 --> 15:18.282
You are not lecturing
an indigenous woman

15:18.293 --> 15:19.792
about cultural appropriation.

15:19.869 --> 15:22.629
Those redneck idiots out there
vote every year

15:22.705 --> 15:24.297
to strip my people away
from our land,

15:24.374 --> 15:25.539
our rights and our humanity.

15:25.616 --> 15:26.707
So, yeah,

15:26.784 --> 15:27.959
I play into their

15:27.969 --> 15:29.527
magical nubile savage fantasy
for money.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.305
It's not my fault they're
too stupid to see through it.

15:41.340 --> 15:42.890
Were they asking
about the sigil?

15:42.967 --> 15:43.975
Yeah.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.309
Asking about the flyer.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.654
Real dicks about it, too.

16:05.489 --> 16:09.008
Whoo... Dinner is served.

16:10.345 --> 16:11.669
Did you even pay for these?

16:11.680 --> 16:14.130
Uh, I may have come into
some money recently.

16:14.206 --> 16:17.633
It's not my fault the swindler
left buckets of cash unattended.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.894
<i>Salud.
Salud.</i>

16:21.431 --> 16:23.931
What's up, you pregnant?

16:24.008 --> 16:26.693
No, I'm just... I'm tired.
I'm gonna get some water.

16:26.769 --> 16:28.686
He just feels guilty having

16:28.697 --> 16:31.272
anything resembling fun
while Isobel is in...

16:31.348 --> 16:32.732
Rehab.

16:32.808 --> 16:33.700
Makes sense.

16:36.645 --> 16:38.612
Turns out my mom is gonna
lose all her memories

16:38.689 --> 16:39.780
by the time she's 50.

16:39.857 --> 16:41.949
Arizona's a thief.

16:42.026 --> 16:45.828
I've been stuck with Guerin
all day, and Max is moping?

16:45.905 --> 16:48.205
No. Absolutely not.

16:50.659 --> 16:52.752
You gonna follow her?
Nope.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.220
Don't you think she, like,
needs a girlfriend, or whatever?

16:54.297 --> 16:55.212
Nope.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.380
What's up, Texas?

16:56.457 --> 16:59.633
I'm having a crappy day.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.302
So I'm gonna forget
all about it.

17:01.378 --> 17:04.063
Join me, will ya?

17:04.140 --> 17:06.848

So, you overthrow your father,

18:28.891 --> 18:31.818
sent him to Africa, and brought
a girl into the clubhouse?

18:31.894 --> 18:33.653
I'm 28 years old,
served two tours,

18:33.729 --> 18:35.312
and could break
12 bones in your body

18:35.323 --> 18:36.814
in less than a second
and a half.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.324
Who you calling a girl?

18:38.401 --> 18:40.568
I called you because
we are looking into an M.E.

18:40.644 --> 18:42.069
named Dr. Jane Holden.

18:42.146 --> 18:43.237
She works at your hospital.

18:43.314 --> 18:44.321
Do you know her?

18:44.332 --> 18:46.490
Her name is familiar.

18:46.567 --> 18:47.992
Why do you ask?

18:48.002 --> 18:50.828
Holden only signs off
on autopsy reports

18:50.839 --> 18:53.673
of people who die
under strange circumstances.

18:53.749 --> 18:56.292
All 14 of them,

18:56.368 --> 18:58.177
said killed
by a mysterious handprint.

18:58.254 --> 19:00.838
Yeah, I'm sorry, did you...

19:00.849 --> 19:02.590
14 deaths?

19:02.666 --> 19:04.100
Rosa Ortecho was the first.

19:11.434 --> 19:13.526
Shouldn't you be heading home?

19:13.603 --> 19:16.937
Oh, I'm sorry, to let the guys
handle the scary stuff?

19:17.014 --> 19:18.606
Look, Master Sergeant Manes

19:18.682 --> 19:20.941
threatened
my sister's life, okay?

19:21.018 --> 19:23.277
If I were smart, I'd stay
in line with his orders,

19:23.354 --> 19:24.996
be quiet,
and report just to him.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.490
But...

19:28.567 --> 19:31.118
someone I work with
might be involved.

19:31.195 --> 19:32.086
Max Evans.

19:33.239 --> 19:34.330
Right.

19:35.458 --> 19:36.966
Is that why you
brought this to us,

19:37.043 --> 19:38.834
after sitting on it
for six weeks?

19:38.911 --> 19:41.003
Your father indicated that Evans

19:41.080 --> 19:42.388
might have a connection
to this case,

19:42.465 --> 19:45.382
and now I think he's a suspect
in a missing persons case.

19:45.393 --> 19:46.300
His sister.

19:46.311 --> 19:47.801
Isobel isn't missing.

19:47.878 --> 19:50.062
Trust me.

19:50.139 --> 19:52.306
Look, you don't need
to involve yourself in any of...

19:52.383 --> 19:53.724
If you push me out,
I go to the sheriff.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.017
All right?

19:55.094 --> 19:56.903
Or-or I'll tell Jesse Manes.

19:56.979 --> 19:59.188
And I have a feeling
that neither of you wants that.

19:59.265 --> 20:00.898
Did you just threaten
to tattle to our parents?

20:00.909 --> 20:02.691
You'll regret this,

20:02.768 --> 20:04.026
Jenna.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.078
I've been where you are.
Oh, really?

20:06.155 --> 20:07.738
Investigating a serial killer?

20:07.749 --> 20:10.208
Just tell her.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.704
If what you're suggesting
is true,

20:15.781 --> 20:18.207
we aren't investigating
a serial killer.

20:18.284 --> 20:22.670
We are investigating
an alien serial killer.

20:39.021 --> 20:41.656
You got another one of those?

20:45.194 --> 20:46.869
That's better.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.572
What are you doing out here?

20:50.649 --> 20:52.741
There's an entire
bar full of women

20:52.818 --> 20:54.243
who know nothing about you.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.630
I am just trying to
get some fresh air, Mm.

20:57.707 --> 20:58.956
Sober up.

20:59.033 --> 21:02.042
Fresh air's overrated.

21:02.119 --> 21:04.595
So is sobering up.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.383
<i>Did we lose our people?</i>

21:09.460 --> 21:11.477
Well, Alanis is
getting some air,

21:11.554 --> 21:14.388
and Michael is drunkenly
following her around.

21:14.465 --> 21:15.815
Oh.

21:15.891 --> 21:17.308
Yeah, I have his keys, though.

21:17.384 --> 21:19.485
I can give you a ride
back to Roswell.

21:19.562 --> 21:23.731
No, it's a long drive,
and you look exhausted.

21:23.807 --> 21:26.275
Mm. I haven't been sleeping.

21:26.352 --> 21:29.278
You know that feeling where
you can't get comfortable?

21:29.355 --> 21:30.738
You know,

21:30.814 --> 21:34.658
the whole world feels wrong
without Isobel, and...

21:34.669 --> 21:37.494
I know, it's weird.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.163
It's not so weird.

21:39.239 --> 21:41.090
It's weird.

21:42.701 --> 21:44.626
Okay, well, you're
too tired to drive,

21:44.703 --> 21:46.503
and I'm currently
made of tequila,

21:46.514 --> 21:49.757
so, there's a motel
across the street.

21:49.833 --> 21:52.593
We can get a couple rooms,
text Michael and Maria

21:52.669 --> 21:54.020
where we're at.

21:54.096 --> 21:56.355
Yeah. Sounds good.

21:57.933 --> 22:00.309
You know, I knew
something weird was going on,

22:00.386 --> 22:03.979
but "Max Evans is an alien
murderer" wasn't top of my list.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.815
Just out of curiosity,

22:06.892 --> 22:08.859
what was?

22:08.870 --> 22:11.370
I don't know.
Wizard murderer?

22:12.898 --> 22:14.948
Max isn't any kind of murderer.

22:15.025 --> 22:16.992
I mean... probably.
I don't know.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.494
No, he's not.

22:18.570 --> 22:21.538
My dad is a bigot
with no moral compass.

22:21.549 --> 22:24.291
Nothing he says about anyone
should be taken as truth.

22:24.368 --> 22:27.503
Is everyone in this town
in love with Max Evans?

22:27.579 --> 22:29.213
Angsty nerd isn't really
my type,

22:29.289 --> 22:31.340
even if he is tall.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.476
Is your type angry cowboy?

22:35.337 --> 22:38.064
That's why you shut down
Project Shepherd.

22:38.140 --> 22:41.683
So your dad would stop
digging into your boyfriend.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.685
No, I...
I shut down Project Shepherd

22:43.762 --> 22:45.521
because it was
an unauthorized mission,

22:45.597 --> 22:49.733
exploiting military resources
for a-a-a harmful agenda.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.693
Chill. I respect your choices.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.570
And I'm at the end of
my enlistment period.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.081
I didn't ask for this legacy.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.292
Did you?

23:05.617 --> 23:07.376
My admin buddy got back to me.

23:07.453 --> 23:09.053
Cameron was right.

23:10.264 --> 23:11.972
There is no Dr. Holden
in Roswell.

23:14.626 --> 23:17.219
There never was.

23:17.296 --> 23:19.680
So Holden is a farce that
Project Shepherd used

23:19.756 --> 23:21.148
to just keep this quiet.

23:24.520 --> 23:25.602
Where are you going?

23:25.613 --> 23:28.105
Project Shepherd began

23:28.116 --> 23:30.658
as a cover-up to keep
America from learning about

23:30.734 --> 23:33.777
aliens and descending
into fear and chaos.

23:33.788 --> 23:35.487
But if there is a killer

23:35.564 --> 23:37.790
preying on vulnerable people...

23:37.867 --> 23:40.042
then maybe fear is justified.

23:44.615 --> 23:46.540
As of tomorrow
morning at 0800 hours,

23:46.617 --> 23:48.843
Project Shepherd is back on
for one more operation.

23:50.304 --> 23:53.013
But this time, I'm in charge.

23:56.144 --> 23:59.094
Only got one room.
King-size bed.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.647
It's the jalapeño room.
Real spicy.

24:03.634 --> 24:06.518
I'll sleep in the truck.
No, don't be silly.

24:06.595 --> 24:09.146
No, no, no, it's...
It's fine. We're adults.

24:09.157 --> 24:10.564
Never mind.

24:10.641 --> 24:13.451
Found another avail...
the Alamo room.

24:16.664 --> 24:19.039
Which of you is most
into mass carnage?

24:52.558 --> 24:54.200

24:54.276 --> 24:56.035
No. You?

24:56.111 --> 24:57.569
Couldn't get comfortable.

24:57.646 --> 24:59.363
How's the Alamo?

24:59.373 --> 25:01.114
I'm pretty sure
I'll remember it.

25:01.191 --> 25:02.416
Mm.

25:06.905 --> 25:09.456
I'm sorry you didn't get
what you came here for.

25:09.533 --> 25:13.794
Shouldn't have let myself become
a hoping kind of person.

25:13.870 --> 25:16.296
I don't know,
I just keep thinking

25:16.373 --> 25:19.132
that I wish there was someone
out there who could relate.

25:19.209 --> 25:25.013
I know you miss Isobel,
but you still have Michael.

25:25.090 --> 25:27.683
Don't tell him,
but I actually kind of like him.

25:27.759 --> 25:30.727
It's different
for Isobel and Michael.

25:30.738 --> 25:34.198
My gift can be
a hell of a burden.

25:37.060 --> 25:39.069
Honestly, I've...

25:39.080 --> 25:41.530
wondered if I shouldn't do
what Arizona purports to do.

25:41.607 --> 25:43.532
If I'm wasting this thing.

25:43.609 --> 25:46.076
When you heal people,
it makes you sick, Max.

25:46.087 --> 25:48.537
Yeah, maybe it wouldn't
if I practiced more.

25:50.616 --> 25:54.501
Since I joined the force,
I have seen five civilians die.

25:54.578 --> 25:56.762
Jeff Gretchen...

25:56.839 --> 25:58.213
heroin overdose.

25:58.290 --> 26:01.267
Hayley Spire...
gunshot to the stomach.

26:01.343 --> 26:04.177
Frankie Vallette
was a car wreck, and

26:04.254 --> 26:06.555
Walter Inman threw himself
off the JP White building.

26:06.632 --> 26:09.433
And then you.
You're the only one I saved.

26:09.443 --> 26:12.894
I was afraid of exposing myself,

26:12.971 --> 26:14.521
so I... I don't know.

26:14.598 --> 26:18.358
Not saving someone isn't
the same as killing them.

26:18.435 --> 26:19.943
Do you really believe that?

26:19.954 --> 26:21.612
I'm trying to.

26:21.688 --> 26:24.698
The problem with having
a superpower, right?

26:24.775 --> 26:28.452
Yeah. Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.871
<i>Henry IV.</i>

26:30.947 --> 26:32.464
<i>Part 2.</i>

26:40.308 --> 26:42.224
May I?

26:47.631 --> 26:49.556
I want to thank you again

26:49.633 --> 26:51.475
for everything you're
doing for Isobel.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.819
I-I know we don't deserve your help...
You were

26:53.896 --> 26:55.354
a kid
in an impossible circumstance

26:55.430 --> 26:56.822
with no one to turn to.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.609
I would do anything
for my sister,

27:00.686 --> 27:03.612
so how can I hate you
for a moment of desperation?

27:03.689 --> 27:05.947
I let you believe for ten years...
Yes, but

27:06.024 --> 27:08.208
I'm not angry at you for that.

27:11.738 --> 27:13.955
I don't trust people, Max.

27:14.032 --> 27:18.177
I-I... I don't think
people are inherently good.

27:18.253 --> 27:20.137
But I believed you were.

27:21.924 --> 27:24.558
So when you lied to me,
it broke my heart.

27:27.438 --> 27:30.814
I was angry at myself
for letting that happen.

27:34.103 --> 27:36.603
It's not your fault
that I let you down.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.947
But that's the thing.

27:40.726 --> 27:43.243
I still believe you're good.

27:48.450 --> 27:50.542
Good night, Max.

27:50.619 --> 27:52.211
Good night.

27:59.536 --> 28:02.221
I know you don't like me.

28:02.297 --> 28:03.472
And that's cool.

28:05.893 --> 28:08.009
But all this is a lot.

28:08.086 --> 28:11.471
If you ever want to drop the
"0800 hours" soldier jargon,

28:11.548 --> 28:13.807
we can get a beer, we can...

28:13.884 --> 28:17.310
My dad listed Guerin
and his friends as threats.

28:17.387 --> 28:19.354
I didn't want to believe it.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.566
But if there have been
14 murders...

28:22.576 --> 28:24.735
Listen.

28:24.745 --> 28:26.620
Max and Guerin...

28:27.773 --> 28:30.699
...and Isobel...

28:30.776 --> 28:33.160
have done things
I can't really forgive.

28:33.236 --> 28:34.870
But...

28:34.946 --> 28:36.872
they're kids we grew up with.

28:36.948 --> 28:38.424
You know?

28:40.577 --> 28:42.136
They're not...

28:44.080 --> 28:45.681
...that.

28:48.010 --> 28:51.270
If you care about him as much
as it looks like you do,

28:51.346 --> 28:52.813
then talk to him.

28:55.350 --> 28:57.776
I just... I can't go in blind.

28:57.853 --> 29:01.104
I'm talking about a
conversation, Manes,

29:01.115 --> 29:03.157
not a war.

29:07.938 --> 29:09.738
You have no idea where we are.

29:09.815 --> 29:11.457
Uh, I know exactly where we are.

29:11.533 --> 29:13.625
We're in the same spot
we were ten minutes ago,

29:13.702 --> 29:15.461
because we just made a circle.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.466
Please tell me you're not trying
to navigate by the stars.

29:20.542 --> 29:21.917
Aw, I'm just

29:21.993 --> 29:24.377
hoping a meteorite
will strike me down

29:24.454 --> 29:26.379
and end my suffering.
Ha-ha.

29:26.456 --> 29:28.298
That's not the way!

29:28.309 --> 29:31.477
Well, it's the only way
we haven't tried yet.

29:31.553 --> 29:33.762
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

29:33.839 --> 29:35.889
"Oh, I can lead the way, DeLuca.

29:35.966 --> 29:38.317
I'm-I'm one with
the desert, DeLuca."

29:38.393 --> 29:40.277
"I'm basically a
coyote, DeLuca."

29:46.327 --> 29:48.652
I just needed some quiet.

29:48.662 --> 29:51.872
It's definitely not that way
because there's no light.

30:16.214 --> 30:17.848
I need to talk to you.
Sorry, Officer.

30:17.924 --> 30:18.816
Shop's closed.

30:19.935 --> 30:22.686
247 bucks.

30:22.696 --> 30:24.855
A couple hundred.

30:24.865 --> 30:27.190
And this is genuine leather.

30:27.267 --> 30:29.317
I'm trying to speak
your language here.

30:29.394 --> 30:32.320
You'll do anything for a buck,
I'll do anything for information

30:32.397 --> 30:33.822
about that symbol.

30:33.899 --> 30:35.574
Arizona,

30:35.584 --> 30:37.751
get in the car.
And miss the striptease?

30:42.908 --> 30:45.584
You'll forgive us
for a little skepticism

30:45.660 --> 30:47.878
when a loud white cop

30:47.888 --> 30:51.390
shows up demanding information
about family secrets.

30:51.466 --> 30:54.467
That symbol is connected
to my family

30:54.544 --> 30:56.478
and <i> my</i> past.

30:58.065 --> 31:00.056
Well, that's commitment.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.683
I need

31:01.760 --> 31:03.402
to know more about my past
in order

31:03.478 --> 31:05.228
to make sure
my sister has a future.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.480
I'm not gonna let her end up

31:07.557 --> 31:09.324
on the list of people
I didn't save.

31:15.565 --> 31:18.575
When I was a child,
there was a woman who lived

31:18.586 --> 31:20.493
on the reservation,
and she could

31:20.570 --> 31:21.879
heal people with her hands.

31:21.955 --> 31:23.463
And she'd draw that symbol?

31:23.540 --> 31:26.541
It drew itself.

31:26.618 --> 31:30.587
Anywhere she went, spilled water
changed course to draw it,

31:30.598 --> 31:33.048
fire burned just so.

31:33.124 --> 31:34.674
Did she say where she came from?

31:34.751 --> 31:37.260
No. She refused
to leave the reservation.

31:37.337 --> 31:40.263
And all those years,
she never spoke.

31:40.274 --> 31:41.723
Until the day she died.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.433
She said,

31:43.444 --> 31:46.445
"He has arrived so I may leave."

31:46.521 --> 31:47.854
And she was gone.

31:47.931 --> 31:49.448
When did she die?

31:49.524 --> 31:50.607
Summer.

31:50.618 --> 31:52.859
20, maybe 21 years ago.

31:52.936 --> 31:55.287
We always thought
someone would come.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.874

And I love you.

35:16.398 --> 35:21.109
You believe in the good in me

35:21.186 --> 35:25.497
So is it so crazy
that I believe in you, too?

35:25.574 --> 35:28.158
Without evidence.

35:28.168 --> 35:31.327

36:15.573 --> 36:18.458
Why?

36:18.534 --> 36:21.094
I ran out of reasons not to.

36:23.223 --> 36:25.882
Was it worth the wait?

36:25.893 --> 36:28.176
Yes.

36:28.253 --> 36:30.178
Yes, absolutely.

36:30.255 --> 36:32.138
Let's never wait again, okay?

36:32.215 --> 36:34.482
No more waiting, ever.

37:18.803 --> 37:20.687
Thought you had the day off?

37:20.763 --> 37:22.948
Just waiting on some paperwork.

37:23.024 --> 37:25.733
Thought I'd sneak a peek
at your samples. And?

37:25.810 --> 37:27.694
36 hours,
and the cells are stable.

37:27.770 --> 37:29.112
You did it.

37:29.122 --> 37:30.947
You found a way to cure Isobel.

37:30.958 --> 37:32.949
But I don't think

37:32.960 --> 37:34.626
you should free Isobel
quite yet.

37:36.404 --> 37:38.538
She might be more dangerous
than we think.

37:38.614 --> 37:41.291
Maybe you should sit down.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.918
Y-You can cancel
the missing person report.

37:43.995 --> 37:47.297
I saw my wife this morning.

37:47.307 --> 37:51.384
Rehab, just like they all said.

37:51.461 --> 37:54.137
Yeah. Apologize to the sheriff
for me, for wasting her time.

37:54.147 --> 37:57.941
I'll, uh, I'll stop by
with apology doughnuts later.

38:07.902 --> 38:09.402
I was trying to remember

38:09.479 --> 38:11.112
where I knew
Dr. Holden's name from.

38:11.189 --> 38:13.948
Then it occurred to me.
My father.

38:14.025 --> 38:15.500
Holden signed his death records.

38:18.171 --> 38:20.288
Which means he didn't die
of a brain tumor.

38:20.365 --> 38:23.916
Whatever killed him...
whoever killed him...

38:23.993 --> 38:26.928
Master Sergeant Jesse Manes
covered it up.

38:40.176 --> 38:42.518
What are you doing here?

38:42.529 --> 38:45.655
Um, I, uh, just...

38:46.700 --> 38:48.116
What are you doing?

38:48.193 --> 38:49.492
There's something in my boot.

38:51.687 --> 38:53.163
Uh, look, the truth is...

38:58.194 --> 38:59.961
That's Maria's necklace.

39:05.034 --> 39:06.343
What were you saying?

39:09.222 --> 39:13.892
Um... there's a rattle
in my car.

39:13.968 --> 39:15.635
I was, I was hoping
that Sanders could look at it.

39:15.711 --> 39:17.553
Sanders isn't here today.

39:17.564 --> 39:19.347
And he's half blind,
so I c... I could check it out.

39:19.424 --> 39:21.983
No, it's fine. Um, I-I'll just
come back when he's here.

39:29.559 --> 39:31.076
No.

39:32.746 --> 39:34.537
I'm tired of walking away.

39:36.607 --> 39:39.325
I'm tired of not saying
what I want to say.

39:39.402 --> 39:41.202
And what do you want to say,
Alex?

39:41.279 --> 39:42.504
That I loved you.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.833
And I think that you loved me.

39:46.909 --> 39:48.376
For a long time.

39:48.453 --> 39:51.262
Yeah.

39:51.339 --> 39:54.924
But we didn't even know
each other that well, did we?

39:54.935 --> 39:56.384
I mean, we just,

39:56.461 --> 39:57.677
we-we connected,

39:57.753 --> 39:59.262
like something...
Cosmic.

39:59.272 --> 40:00.763
Yeah, but we didn't even
do that much talking.

40:00.774 --> 40:03.391
And I want to talk.

40:03.468 --> 40:05.276
I want to start over,
I-I want to...

40:05.353 --> 40:07.228
I don't know,
I want to be friends.

40:07.305 --> 40:10.073
I...

40:14.121 --> 40:16.329
I want to know who you are,
Guerin.

40:26.282 --> 40:29.217
Do you want to know who I am?

40:33.140 --> 40:35.306
Or do you want
to know what I am?

40:37.502 --> 40:39.969
Yes.

40:39.980 --> 40:42.889
"And he wondered if this
would always be his plight,

40:42.965 --> 40:45.316
"trading a currency
of victories and tragedies,

40:45.393 --> 40:47.310
"bartering with
a mercenary universe

40:47.320 --> 40:50.396
"for a hope he might
have once deserved.

40:50.473 --> 40:51.731
"After all,
the man had found a way

40:51.807 --> 40:53.441
"to live with half a heart once,

40:53.518 --> 40:56.911
had locked up darkened chambers
and pretended them away."

40:58.856 --> 41:00.156
Liz. Hey.

41:00.167 --> 41:01.449
Did you write that?

41:01.526 --> 41:03.493
What are you,

41:03.569 --> 41:04.669
what are you doing back here?

41:04.746 --> 41:06.171
I think I figured it out.

41:06.247 --> 41:08.456
I mean, I-I can't be certain
until I try it,

41:08.533 --> 41:09.999
but over the course
of six controlled trials

41:10.010 --> 41:12.135
I used various applications
of her mitochond...

41:16.207 --> 41:18.475
Thank you.

41:21.170 --> 41:23.304
Um, there's one more thing
you need to know.

41:23.381 --> 41:25.023
Rosa wasn't the only person
murdered by an alien.

41:25.099 --> 41:26.807
There were a lot more.

41:26.884 --> 41:29.352
Wait, no. I-Isobel hasn't
had blackouts since 2008.

41:29.362 --> 41:30.436
I believe her.
I know.

41:30.513 --> 41:31.687
Without evidence, I know.

41:31.698 --> 41:34.440
That's why I brought this.

41:34.517 --> 41:36.701
The old woman wasn't
your last chance

41:36.778 --> 41:39.320
at learning
about your home, Max.

41:39.397 --> 41:43.208
I think there's a fourth alien
in Roswell.

41:43.284 --> 41:44.951
And I think they're
far more dangerous

41:45.027 --> 41:46.544
than anything we've seen before.
