01:23.885 --> 01:25.688
Go. Go. Go!

01:56.619 --> 01:58.887
<i>We need to get in the car now.</i>

01:58.889 --> 02:00.888
<i>We need to get in and go
before the girls...</i>

02:00.890 --> 02:01.791
<i>Johnny.</i>

02:04.393 --> 02:05.628
<i>Johnny.</i>

02:07.797 --> 02:09.930
- <i>Johnny!<i>
- <i>We're already dead.</i></i></i>

02:09.931 --> 02:11.600
<i>Dead. Dead.</i>

02:12.869 --> 02:13.804
<i>Johnny.</i>

02:15.005 --> 02:15.939
Kill me.

02:18.475 --> 02:20.644
Wake up!

02:34.858 --> 02:36.393
<i>My name's Kurt Matheson.</i>

02:37.627 --> 02:38.996
<i>I'm 35 years old.</i>

02:41.731 --> 02:46.034
<i>I've lived
through 12,787 days.</i>

02:46.036 --> 02:50.772
<i>I've had the same nightmare
for the last 5,475 nights.</i>

02:50.774 --> 02:55.043
<i>Surviving has always
been something I'm pretty good at.</i>

02:55.045 --> 02:57.379
<i>But I don't know how much
more of this I wanna take.</i>

03:00.885 --> 03:02.086
<i>Kill me.</i>

03:07.657 --> 03:08.759
<i>I know your name.</i>

03:19.803 --> 03:20.737
<i>Kurt.</i>

05:07.013 --> 05:10.114
<i>Thousands
of years of progress,</i>

05:10.116 --> 05:12.983
<i>and all it took was
30 days to destroy it.</i>

05:12.985 --> 05:15.151
<i>The world I used to know
is gone.</i>

05:17.622 --> 05:18.822
Two.

05:18.824 --> 05:21.191
<i>Environmental disasters</i>

05:21.193 --> 05:23.894
<i>and a global
economic fallout...</i>

05:23.896 --> 05:25.796
- How much?
- Hundred.

05:25.798 --> 05:27.131
<i>...sent everything
into chaos.</i>

05:27.133 --> 05:28.034
Okay.

05:32.939 --> 05:35.842
<i>Populations decreased.
People fled the cities.</i>

05:38.610 --> 05:41.880
<i>Western civilization
collapsed in about 30 days.</i>

05:43.282 --> 05:44.814
<i>They called it
the "Black Month."</i>

05:44.816 --> 05:46.783
I don't understand
what you are saying.

05:49.256 --> 05:51.789
Five?

05:51.791 --> 05:53.124
Get down on the ground!

05:53.126 --> 05:55.159
Shut the fuck up and get
down on the ground!

05:55.161 --> 05:57.795
You fucking hear me,
cocksucking motherfucker? Huh?

05:57.797 --> 06:00.266
Shut up! Shut up!

06:01.901 --> 06:03.736
Hey. Okay, Steve, we got everything.

06:05.004 --> 06:06.005
Come on.
We gotta leave.

06:13.113 --> 06:14.747
Boom!

06:20.620 --> 06:21.854
<i>Then there was the war.</i>

06:23.790 --> 06:25.892
<i>Long and aimless.</i>

06:28.728 --> 06:31.028
<i>By the time it was over,</i>

06:31.030 --> 06:33.831
<i>I couldn't recognize
where I was.</i>

06:33.833 --> 06:37.337
<i>There was just
too much destruction.</i>

06:40.074 --> 06:42.042
<i>Now, in this dust
that was a city...</i>

06:44.878 --> 06:47.047
<i>I think if I could
find a souvenir...</i>

06:48.348 --> 06:50.348
<i>Just to prove
the world was here.</i>

06:50.350 --> 06:53.185
You see the world
around you?

06:53.187 --> 06:55.753
You all know what's
happening as well as I do.

06:55.755 --> 06:57.289
I'm not a prophet.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.990
I am not a messiah.

06:58.992 --> 07:01.726
I'm just a man
who sees the truth.

07:01.728 --> 07:03.728
And we are to blame.
You okay?

07:03.730 --> 07:05.198
It is our fault.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.101
We are the cancer...

07:08.769 --> 07:12.971
the metastasis that corrodes
our Mother Earth.

07:12.973 --> 07:15.240
The world
has been exploited.

07:15.242 --> 07:17.008
The end of life on Earth
is now...

07:17.010 --> 07:19.811
I saw the best minds
of my generation

07:19.813 --> 07:23.215
desperate,
destroyed by madness!

07:23.217 --> 07:25.854
Searching for
the angry prick of drugs!

07:27.088 --> 07:28.857
You, too, over there
see the truth.

07:30.724 --> 07:35.161
We sit on an arsenal of atomic
weapons controlled by madmen.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.233
We choke nature with
pollution and radiation.

07:40.101 --> 07:42.102
We destroy life
in the name of progress.

07:44.004 --> 07:45.804
Shame on us!

07:45.806 --> 07:47.840
We have only one place
to live in the cosmos,

07:47.842 --> 07:49.711
and we are poisoning it.

07:50.945 --> 07:53.346
We have an entire menu
of destruction.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.947
Nuclear holocaust.

07:54.949 --> 07:56.382
Bombs are old-fashioned.

07:56.384 --> 07:59.218
Melting ice caps,

07:59.220 --> 08:02.755
which could cause a slight
deviation in the Earth's axis.

08:02.757 --> 08:05.191
A slight deviation,
which in turn,

08:05.193 --> 08:07.960
will set off an apocalyptic
electrical storm

08:07.962 --> 08:10.463
that will burn up all the
oxygen in the atmosphere.

08:10.465 --> 08:13.467
Yes! It's the end of the world!

08:13.469 --> 08:15.768
Everybody fuck!

08:15.770 --> 08:19.373
Come on! Everybody fuck!

08:22.977 --> 08:25.044
Don't touch me.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.413
- Get outta here.
- We wanna hear this man.

08:26.415 --> 08:27.749
You came back?

08:28.883 --> 08:30.349
- No way!
- Loser!

08:37.259 --> 08:39.760
He came back.

08:45.334 --> 08:48.070
<i>12,790 days.</i>

08:52.107 --> 08:53.309
<i>Man created time.</i>

08:55.311 --> 08:57.810
<i>And because of this,</i>

08:57.812 --> 09:03.016
<i>we suffer a paralyzing fear
that no other animal endures.</i>

09:06.255 --> 09:09.122
<i>The fear of time
running out.</i>

09:12.995 --> 09:15.829
<i>I remember
when I was a kid,</i>

09:15.831 --> 09:17.531
<i>my dad kept
a large jar of marbles</i>

09:17.533 --> 09:19.335
<i>on the bookshelf
in the living room.</i>

09:22.004 --> 09:24.873
<i>And he said he figured he had one
for every month he had left to live.</i>

09:27.010 --> 09:28.811
<i>On the first Sunday
of every month...</i>

09:30.813 --> 09:32.081
<i>he'd remove one.</i>

09:34.217 --> 09:36.950
<i>I just keep
a running tally in my head.</i>

10:34.110 --> 10:36.280
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. It doesn't work.

10:37.248 --> 10:39.081
Nothing here works.

10:39.083 --> 10:41.116
Maybe you should have a sign
or something that says that.

10:41.118 --> 10:46.020
You see that sign?

10:46.022 --> 10:48.490
We can't sell military-grade
equipment that works.

10:48.492 --> 10:50.392
It's all for show.

10:50.394 --> 10:52.563
Government doesn't want this shit
getting into the wrong hands.

10:55.131 --> 10:56.400
Give him a refund.

10:58.669 --> 11:00.936
Yeah.
Yeah, give me a refund.

11:00.938 --> 11:03.205
Why don't you
pick up a book?

11:03.207 --> 11:05.409
What?
Take a book.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.344
It's free.

11:08.346 --> 11:10.247
Uh, yeah, I...
I don't need a book.

11:11.349 --> 11:12.483
Try this one.

11:13.417 --> 11:15.052
I wrote it myself.

11:22.058 --> 11:23.660
Hey, that's good
for you.

11:23.662 --> 11:25.430
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

11:27.232 --> 11:30.633
But this, you know, it's, uh...
Nah, this is of no use to me.

11:30.635 --> 11:33.369
I don't need a damn handbook.
It's more than a handbook.

11:33.371 --> 11:35.003
It's a mind book.

11:35.005 --> 11:39.475
I need supplies...
that work.

11:39.477 --> 11:42.311
I'm sure my employee mentioned
we're limited in supplies.

11:42.313 --> 11:44.179
Who? Hippie Hansen?
Yeah, he sure did.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.281
All right.

11:46.283 --> 11:48.353
I can recommend suppliers,
if you'd like.

11:49.354 --> 11:50.355
Take my card.

11:52.624 --> 11:55.024
A lot of people think that
the world is coming to an end.

11:55.026 --> 11:56.228
I don't think it.

11:57.062 --> 11:58.463
I know it.

11:59.731 --> 12:01.598
People chatter
but do nothing about it.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.501
But it's coming,
and we're going to be ready.

12:04.503 --> 12:07.506
I'm going to be damn sure that
the best of our species survives.

12:08.540 --> 12:10.105
Along with myself, of course.

12:10.107 --> 12:13.611
That's funny.

12:13.613 --> 12:16.146
Call me if you like. I can
help you find things that work.

12:16.148 --> 12:18.214
Come to one of our meetings.

12:18.216 --> 12:21.251
Don't worry. It's not a cult.
We're just survivalists.

12:21.253 --> 12:24.055
Yeah, I've seen you out there
with all those people before.

12:24.723 --> 12:25.991
I know it.

12:28.994 --> 12:30.228
Think I'll pass though.

12:32.364 --> 12:35.533
Well, if you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

12:35.535 --> 12:39.238
Oh. That can be fixed.
It's just a broken gasket.

12:42.140 --> 12:45.275
You shouldn't let a flimsy piece
of rubber be the end of you.

12:45.277 --> 12:47.279
We need to learn
to fix things ourselves.

12:48.146 --> 12:49.647
Study it.

12:49.649 --> 12:51.283
The book.

12:53.485 --> 12:54.720
Thanks.

13:09.602 --> 13:12.303
Got nothing
but old shit in here.

13:12.305 --> 13:15.441
Where'd you find all this old shit?
Don't like old shit.

13:24.350 --> 13:26.753
Why does that guy look familiar?
Does he looks familiar to you?

13:29.790 --> 13:33.192
Hey, look, man. Another survivor.
And I know the weirdo.

13:34.193 --> 13:35.827
How do you know that man?

13:35.829 --> 13:37.796
He was at the store that we
were robbing the other night.

13:37.798 --> 13:39.563
Come on, pussy.

13:39.565 --> 13:40.832
What's up?
What's up?

13:40.834 --> 13:42.366
Come on. What's wrong, eh?

13:42.368 --> 13:44.101
Is all of this
necessary?

13:44.103 --> 13:45.603
Wow. Wow.

13:45.605 --> 13:48.108
Okay, okay. It's okay.

13:49.309 --> 13:50.511
Um...

13:52.379 --> 13:55.280
You have something
that's ours.

13:55.282 --> 13:58.817
Um, I don't... I don't know
if you're aware,

13:58.819 --> 14:01.786
but to be in this specific
location, you need to pay.

14:01.788 --> 14:04.388
I don't have any money.
I'm just here to help.

14:04.390 --> 14:06.259
Money will be useless
soon anyway.

14:07.460 --> 14:09.460
I'm going to kill you!

14:09.462 --> 14:10.695
Come on!

14:11.866 --> 14:13.698
Nice kick, man!

14:13.700 --> 14:15.734
This ought to teach him! Thought
he could actually survive!

14:15.736 --> 14:17.837
And he's got a gas mask.

14:17.839 --> 14:19.872
Come on, French.
Get him up. Come on.

14:19.874 --> 14:22.440
Whoo-hoo!

14:22.442 --> 14:24.309
Where do you
want to go, huh?

14:24.311 --> 14:26.211
Yeah, French, kick his ass.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.782
If money's not gonna be
necessary, old fella...

14:32.184 --> 14:33.818
then why are you
selling all this shit?

14:33.820 --> 14:36.355
Well, we need some
to sustain all this,

14:36.357 --> 14:39.293
buy supplies, prepare
our refuge in the mountains.

14:40.327 --> 14:42.162
We've spent all our money.

14:44.398 --> 14:46.199
Jesus Christ.

14:47.769 --> 14:50.402
You might be dead before
you get to spend that.

14:50.404 --> 14:52.272
No one gets out
from here.

14:56.843 --> 14:58.777
What the fuck, French?
Man, he's just a bum!

14:58.779 --> 15:00.746
Don't do that.

15:00.748 --> 15:03.751
Don't fuckin' move, or
I'll blow your brains out!

15:06.220 --> 15:08.321
Come on, man!
What you gonna do?

15:08.323 --> 15:10.656
Gonna take us on, huh?

15:10.658 --> 15:12.625
I'm gonna shoot myself
in the fucking mouth

15:12.627 --> 15:14.326
if you don't
shut the fuck up!

15:14.328 --> 15:15.761
Goddamn it.
I'd rather you not do that.

15:15.763 --> 15:16.831
Jesus Christ.

15:18.298 --> 15:19.333
Impressive.

15:19.901 --> 15:21.232
Thank you.

15:21.234 --> 15:22.400
Just come around.
Come around.

15:22.402 --> 15:24.570
Come on. Let's go.
Come on around.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.473
He's not gonna survive
this one!

15:27.475 --> 15:28.576
Pussy.

15:29.410 --> 15:30.610
Come on!

15:30.612 --> 15:32.879
Oh, shit!

15:32.881 --> 15:35.848
Get the fuck up!

15:35.850 --> 15:37.883
We're civil people.
We really are.

15:37.885 --> 15:39.418
We don't...
Come on! Get up.

15:39.420 --> 15:41.554
We don't wanna
hurt anybody, but, uh,

15:41.556 --> 15:42.457
you never know...

15:43.858 --> 15:45.858
where somebody
might end up and, uh...

15:48.664 --> 15:51.832
Enough, please.
You're going to kill him!

15:51.834 --> 15:53.265
Yeah, man.
Call them off!

15:55.303 --> 15:56.739
Let's go.
Come on, guys.

15:57.773 --> 15:59.374
We're done here.
Yeah.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.445
Hmm?

16:05.413 --> 16:06.746
Money?

16:06.748 --> 16:09.183
Tomorrow?
All of it? Hmm?

16:10.385 --> 16:12.719
Today's gonna look
like a picnic. Right?

16:12.721 --> 16:14.356
Yes, yes.
Yeah.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.299
I have you.

16:25.334 --> 16:26.402
I have you.

16:42.284 --> 16:44.518
You're a backstabbing...

16:46.522 --> 16:51.291
<i>...local storm is hitting
the five counties with massive...</i>

16:51.293 --> 16:52.528
<i>You're dead.</i>

16:53.462 --> 16:54.663
<i>Kill me.</i>

16:55.731 --> 16:56.863
We're all already dead.

16:56.865 --> 16:58.298
Kill me.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.535
<i>...hundreds of thousands
of fatalities</i>

17:00.537 --> 17:04.304
<i>and billions of dollars in
property damage have been reported.</i>

17:06.742 --> 17:07.810
<i>Do it!</i>

17:10.279 --> 17:13.280
Hey!

17:13.281 --> 17:14.915
<i>Don't. Don't say nothin'.</i>

17:14.917 --> 17:16.583
<i>Where are you?
Come and help us.</i>

17:16.585 --> 17:18.920
<i>Come and stand
on these corners. Keep up.</i>

17:18.922 --> 17:21.021
<i>Ghosts haunt these halls.</i>

17:21.023 --> 17:24.926
<i>Electrical power failures,
a lack of running water,</i>

17:24.929 --> 17:27.729
<i>and police forces
stretched to their limits...</i>

17:27.731 --> 17:30.567
<i>12,792 days.</i>

17:36.406 --> 17:39.340
<i>Families have nothing. There was
a family that died in the strong winds.</i>

17:47.317 --> 17:50.384
<i>We're on the verge
of a health care implosion.</i>

17:50.386 --> 17:53.488
<i>You have to remember it was not
only homes that were destroyed</i>

17:53.490 --> 17:55.523
<i>but doctors' offices...</i>

17:55.525 --> 17:57.960
<i>Emergency services
have collapsed.</i>

17:57.962 --> 18:00.661
<i>Doctors are fighting against
time and limited resources.</i>

18:00.663 --> 18:03.397
<i>They're leaving kids in squalor.
They have no electricity.</i>

18:03.399 --> 18:05.500
<i>They have no communication
with the outside world.</i>

18:05.502 --> 18:07.468
<i>This area is devastated.</i>

18:25.589 --> 18:26.624
<i>Kill me.</i>

18:33.931 --> 18:37.766
<i>Meteorologists are talking
about a possible massive tsunami</i>

18:37.768 --> 18:39.401
<i>hitting the East Coast,</i>

18:39.403 --> 18:40.970
<i>and new storms
and hurricanes</i>

18:40.972 --> 18:44.040
<i>are being discovered
from one minute to the next.</i>

18:44.042 --> 18:47.509
<i>Weather models are forecasting
winds of up to 80 miles...</i>

19:12.469 --> 19:15.071
<i>We must wake up.
The storm...</i>

19:15.073 --> 19:17.040
<i>The storm is coming soon.</i>

19:17.042 --> 19:20.043
<i>I've spent the last 20 years
traveling the world</i>

19:20.045 --> 19:22.646
<i>preparing people to survive.</i>

19:24.083 --> 19:27.150
<i>I believe
my long pilgrimage ends here.</i>

19:27.152 --> 19:30.086
<i>The atmosphere we have
relied upon for our breathing</i>

19:30.088 --> 19:34.190
<i>has become a hothouse
of poisonous gases.</i>

19:34.192 --> 19:37.996
<i>There is a layer that exists
between Earth and space.</i>

19:39.497 --> 19:41.463
<i>The charge residing
in this layer</i>

19:41.465 --> 19:46.535
<i>measures 500,000 coulombs
at any given moment.</i>

19:46.537 --> 19:47.938
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

19:47.940 --> 19:49.108
<i>What does that mean?</i>

19:50.176 --> 19:52.475
<i>An apocalyptic electrical storm</i>

19:52.477 --> 19:56.113
<i>that will destroy life on Earth
in a blink of an eye.</i>

20:08.560 --> 20:10.159
<i>I need more supplies.</i>

20:10.161 --> 20:13.766
<i>I've nothing left to barter,
so I need money.</i>

20:16.936 --> 20:18.638
<i>Guess I gotta look for a job.</i>

20:21.707 --> 20:23.573
<i>Same bullshit,</i>

20:23.575 --> 20:24.975
<i>even at the end
of the world.</i>

20:24.977 --> 20:26.444
Hello.

20:27.579 --> 20:29.748
You aren't dead, are you?

20:31.549 --> 20:34.084
I don't think so.
What do you think?

20:34.086 --> 20:37.488
Is it true that you
were a soldier?

20:37.490 --> 20:40.925
My best friend told me that you
were some kind of a mad soldier.

20:40.927 --> 20:42.559
But I don't think
that you're mad.

20:42.561 --> 20:44.061
Hey kid.

20:44.063 --> 20:45.531
What's your friend's name?

20:50.703 --> 20:53.604
All right, well, you want me
tell you my name first?

20:53.606 --> 20:54.774
I already
know your name.

20:56.541 --> 20:57.442
Kurt.

21:00.579 --> 21:03.516
My best friend told me
everything about you.

21:05.852 --> 21:07.252
Oh, yeah?

21:07.254 --> 21:09.653
What's your friend's name?
What do you call him?

21:09.655 --> 21:10.756
He's like you.

21:11.891 --> 21:13.526
Yeah, but what's his name?

21:15.195 --> 21:17.061
His name is Johnny.

21:17.063 --> 21:20.130
He told me that you were dead
and that you were a ghost.

21:20.132 --> 21:22.300
But I don't believe
in ghosts.

21:22.302 --> 21:23.937
I'm a big boy.

21:26.073 --> 21:28.108
Well, I have to go.
Bye.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.950
Chap's information here.
All right.

21:38.952 --> 21:40.584
What was that, darling?

21:40.586 --> 21:42.954
Well, there's still
an interview for don Antonio.

21:42.956 --> 21:44.224
There's still an interview?
Yeah.

21:45.791 --> 21:49.028
Okay. I forgot about that.
Hey. Jessica, wait.

21:49.030 --> 21:51.930
Can I talk you about something?
About what?

21:51.932 --> 21:54.599
About many things. And maybe not
now because I see you are kind of...

21:54.601 --> 21:56.001
Yes, I'm kind of busy.
Busy, yeah.

21:56.003 --> 21:58.972
How about later?
I'm gonna be free tonight.

22:00.640 --> 22:01.906
Tonight?

22:01.908 --> 22:04.943
Well, I've...
I've got stuff to do.

22:04.945 --> 22:05.977
Stuff?
Yeah.

22:05.979 --> 22:07.946
But we'll talk later.

22:07.948 --> 22:08.882
Sure.

22:14.255 --> 22:15.589
Hi.

22:17.191 --> 22:20.261
Sorry for the wait.
Uh, you ready?

22:23.864 --> 22:25.964
Hey. Are you there?

22:25.966 --> 22:27.632
Uh, yeah.

22:27.634 --> 22:29.734
Are you Kurt?
Yeah.

22:29.736 --> 22:31.738
Yeah? Okay, come in.
Follow me.

22:34.976 --> 22:36.776
You need some ice
for that?

22:36.778 --> 22:38.677
Oh. No.
No? Sure?

22:38.679 --> 22:40.279
Yeah. It's nothing.

22:40.281 --> 22:42.148
You nervous?

22:42.150 --> 22:44.383
I'm okay.

22:44.385 --> 22:45.785
Good.

22:45.787 --> 22:48.289
Just don't let him
intimidate you.

22:50.091 --> 22:51.159
Okay.

22:52.193 --> 22:53.294
Come.

23:02.837 --> 23:03.938
Sorry, Daddy.

23:05.174 --> 23:07.073
The last candidate is here.

23:07.075 --> 23:09.710
Ah. Have a seat, kid.

23:12.814 --> 23:15.049
Jessica.

23:17.018 --> 23:17.952
Sure.

23:25.194 --> 23:26.962
I'm gonna
get to the point.

23:28.263 --> 23:30.097
I have read your résumé,

23:30.099 --> 23:32.665
and I think you are
what I am looking for.

23:32.667 --> 23:35.168
Clean background. Engineering
experience. Great.

23:35.170 --> 23:37.272
I just need someone
to maintain the place.

23:38.673 --> 23:39.941
And I think
you'll do fine.

23:41.076 --> 23:42.910
Kid, do you speak,
or what?

23:44.679 --> 23:46.949
Yes, sir.
Yeah, when I have to.

23:47.783 --> 23:50.252
Oh. I like that. Good.

23:51.019 --> 23:54.221
Uh, 'cause, for a second,
I thought you were a mute.

23:54.223 --> 23:56.457
And, you know, I couldn't
handle a fucking mute.

23:56.459 --> 23:58.293
It's... It's fucking freaky.
You know what I'm saying?

23:59.161 --> 24:00.360
Yes, sir.

24:00.362 --> 24:02.097
Yeah, good.

24:04.299 --> 24:05.400
So...

24:07.002 --> 24:08.403
what am I not seeing?

24:09.371 --> 24:10.803
What do you mean?

24:10.805 --> 24:13.074
Don't play dumb
with me, kid.

24:13.076 --> 24:15.476
I saw your résumé.
It's great.

24:15.478 --> 24:19.247
But I feel like you're
leaving something out.

24:19.249 --> 24:21.049
Why don't you tell me?
Just... What is it?

24:22.285 --> 24:23.219
Nothing.

24:24.119 --> 24:26.786
I run a security company.

24:26.788 --> 24:29.923
That means I have access
to all kinds of information

24:29.925 --> 24:32.493
about anyone
who walks through that door.

24:32.495 --> 24:33.729
Yeah, sure.

24:35.298 --> 24:37.000
I like
your service record.

24:38.067 --> 24:39.169
I seen it.

24:40.803 --> 24:43.337
Listen. I know,
most of the companies,

24:43.339 --> 24:45.907
they don't want to hire
a combat veteran.

24:45.909 --> 24:48.411
But, personally,
I don't think it's bad.

24:49.913 --> 24:51.780
As a matter of fact,
it could help me out.

24:52.515 --> 24:54.150
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

24:55.051 --> 24:56.052
Okay.

24:56.952 --> 24:57.886
Sorry, Daddy.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.191
Nobody
knock on the door.

25:01.090 --> 25:02.990
<i>¿Qué pasa?</i>

25:02.992 --> 25:05.092
Gomez.

25:05.094 --> 25:08.196
He wants me to tell you that
he's waiting to finish the thing

25:08.198 --> 25:09.931
you talked about earlier.

25:09.933 --> 25:12.800
He was just here.
The <i>thing.</i> Yeah.

25:12.802 --> 25:15.369
Like it's
some state secret.

25:15.371 --> 25:16.072
Jessica.

25:17.273 --> 25:19.275
<i>Por favor.</i>

25:21.044 --> 25:23.879
Sure. Sorry, Daddy.
Ah.

25:23.881 --> 25:26.951
I'm leaving now.
I got stuff to do anyway.

25:31.988 --> 25:34.055
I know this place is not
the best for a girl,

25:34.057 --> 25:37.228
but at least, you know,
I can have her close.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.495
For me, my family
come first.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.131
Do you have family?

25:43.233 --> 25:45.333
No, unfortunately not.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.071
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

25:48.806 --> 25:51.139
Anyway,
as you can see,

25:51.141 --> 25:54.343
if I don't solve problems
here, nobody does.

25:54.345 --> 25:57.381
If you bring me solutions,
you've got the job.

25:58.949 --> 26:00.115
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

26:00.117 --> 26:01.984
Is it a deal?

26:01.986 --> 26:04.386
Yeah, absolutely.
That's fantastic.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.156
No, that... that's great.
Thank you.

26:07.491 --> 26:09.124
Go with Jessica,

26:09.126 --> 26:10.959
and she will get you through
all of the paperwork.

26:10.961 --> 26:11.895
All right?

26:14.098 --> 26:15.367
All right. Thank you.

26:17.201 --> 26:19.469
Hey, kid. Kid.

26:19.471 --> 26:22.070
You know, shave.

26:22.072 --> 26:24.273
Just, you know,
get yourself clean.

26:24.275 --> 26:26.408
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. No problem.
- All right.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.043
All right.

26:28.045 --> 26:30.147
Hey, thank you again.
No problem.

26:58.510 --> 27:01.177
Kill me. Kill me.

27:01.179 --> 27:02.378
Kill me.

27:25.504 --> 27:27.972
<i>I go to bed,
and then I wake up underneath it.</i>

27:30.276 --> 27:34.043
<i>5,481 nights
with the same dream.</i>

27:39.552 --> 27:42.420
<i>The same fire
and blood and death...</i>

27:44.356 --> 27:46.990
<i>over and over.</i>

27:46.992 --> 27:51.228
<i>Because they know that this system can fall!</i>

27:51.230 --> 27:54.533
<i>And we have the energy to fight this
today, tomorrow, and the next day.</i>

27:56.235 --> 28:02.038
<i>Public debt
stands around $73 billion.</i>

28:02.040 --> 28:05.511
<i>80 percent of the city
as covered in water, so...</i>

28:07.178 --> 28:10.046
<i>Four million people died.</i>

28:16.188 --> 28:18.491
<i>A systemic failure
of the government.</i>

28:20.627 --> 28:22.426
<i>We have gone on strike.</i>

28:22.428 --> 28:26.563
<i>We have also engaged in acts
of civil disobedience.</i>

28:26.565 --> 28:29.533
<i>The economy has been
stagnant for more than a decade.</i>

28:29.535 --> 28:31.270
<i>That means it hasn't grown.</i>

28:32.638 --> 28:34.538
<i>The storm's lasting effects,</i>

28:34.540 --> 28:37.943
<i>not just on the city's geography
and infrastructure, but on...</i>

28:42.416 --> 28:45.115
Morning, sunshine.

28:45.117 --> 28:47.318
Hey, how many times are you
gonna fucking shoot at me?

28:47.320 --> 28:49.656
I was just trying to find some milk
for my coffee. What, you got no milk?

28:51.658 --> 28:53.259
It's good
to see you, pal.

28:54.293 --> 28:55.227
Johnny?

28:58.364 --> 29:01.166
Hey, you know,
the kitchen looks good.

29:01.168 --> 29:03.570
Needs a little bit
of upkeep, but easy fix.

29:06.573 --> 29:08.675
Fuck! What? I was
just kidding, man.

29:11.711 --> 29:13.645
No, it can't be.

29:13.647 --> 29:16.114
No, no, it is. Give me a hug.
It's good to see you.

29:16.116 --> 29:18.450
- All right, who the fuck are you?
- Hey, hey. Hey.

29:18.452 --> 29:21.419
You better answer real quick, buddy.
Put the fucking gun down.

29:21.421 --> 29:23.422
Put the fucking gun down.
My front door's locked.

29:23.424 --> 29:26.559
How the fuck did you get in here?
Hey, look at me.

29:26.561 --> 29:28.563
I want you to put the gun down.
It's me.

29:29.329 --> 29:30.430
It's me.

29:31.164 --> 29:32.299
It's Johnny.

29:34.569 --> 29:36.436
It's impossible.
No, no, no.

29:37.537 --> 29:38.605
Put it down.

29:43.410 --> 29:46.179
Hey, hey, it's fine.
Now come here. Come here.

29:57.692 --> 29:59.325
Got to the door
and into my car

29:59.327 --> 30:01.159
by the time the husband
even gets to the door.

30:01.161 --> 30:03.228
And then I was peeling off,

30:03.230 --> 30:05.564
and he was chasing after me down the
street in his stupid fucking suit.

30:05.566 --> 30:08.701
You know, this is shit.

30:14.275 --> 30:15.476
I hate this song.

30:17.779 --> 30:19.347
It's progress though,
huh?

30:22.283 --> 30:25.117
You know, what the fuck happened
to this city, by the way?

30:25.119 --> 30:27.386
I go away for a while, I come
back, and all of a sudden, it's...

30:27.388 --> 30:29.154
I can't even speak English
to people.

30:29.156 --> 30:30.758
It's like
the goddamn Tower of Babel.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.262
Yeah, a lot
of people left.

30:36.465 --> 30:40.165
Lighten up, old man, huh?
What the fuck's going on?

30:40.167 --> 30:44.370
Aren't you the guy who posted
up on top of a fucking mountain?

30:44.372 --> 30:46.606
For three days, three nights,
you didn't eat, you didn't sleep.

30:46.608 --> 30:49.277
You just took out an entire
fuckin' battalion all by yourself.

30:53.514 --> 30:54.783
I don't get it, man.

30:56.751 --> 30:57.718
I mean...

30:59.889 --> 31:01.423
How are you here?

31:06.261 --> 31:07.829
No, man. You died.

31:09.765 --> 31:11.132
I shot you.

31:14.336 --> 31:16.738
I... I put a bullet
in you myself.

31:24.446 --> 31:25.547
I made you.

31:27.416 --> 31:29.284
I fuckin'
made it out, man.

31:30.619 --> 31:32.185
Medevac unit found me
the next day.

31:32.187 --> 31:33.653
I woke up in the hospital,

31:33.655 --> 31:36.523
three days and ten fuckin'
blood transfusions later,

31:36.525 --> 31:38.825
to the ugliest goddamn nurse
I've ever seen, by the way.

31:38.827 --> 31:41.597
She looked like a fuckin' horse.
I swear to God.

31:43.732 --> 31:44.733
Oh, you should've
been there, man.

31:47.270 --> 31:49.236
So, listen to me.
This is what I want you to do.

31:49.238 --> 31:51.806
This is some sage advice,
all right?

31:51.808 --> 31:56.410
I want you to stop all this
crybaby bullshit. Huh?

31:56.412 --> 31:58.881
I want you to go out there. I want you
to find yourself some fuckin' tail.

32:00.883 --> 32:04.284
My God. You must have some hot
little secretary at work, okay?

32:04.286 --> 32:05.788
Some little floozy
on the side?

32:08.256 --> 32:09.458
Do you even work?

32:20.236 --> 32:22.538
I'm taking off.
Good talk.

32:24.874 --> 32:26.342
See you around?

32:28.378 --> 32:29.646
Yeah, I'll
see you around.

32:32.548 --> 32:33.449
Hey.

32:34.551 --> 32:35.884
Hey.

32:35.886 --> 32:38.187
Were you talking to some
little kid about me?

32:39.455 --> 32:40.490
Hmm.

33:29.941 --> 33:32.710
<i>12,793 days...</i>

33:36.013 --> 33:38.280
<i>and this is my first
on the new job.</i>

33:38.282 --> 33:42.284
<i>...of SOS, Save Our Planet.</i>

33:42.286 --> 33:45.389
Shut up, I need to print this.
Do it now.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.390
Is it ready?
Yes. I'm finishing.

33:48.392 --> 33:50.860
<i>...thousands take to the streets
to demand an economy</i>

33:50.862 --> 33:52.528
<i>that works for people
and the planet.</i>

33:52.530 --> 33:54.597
I need to check this.

33:54.599 --> 33:57.734
<i>A world safe from the ravages of climate
change, a world with good jobs...</i>

33:57.736 --> 33:59.434
It seems okay.

33:59.436 --> 34:02.437
<i>...clean air and water,
and healthy communities.</i>

34:34.405 --> 34:37.342
Hey, what are you doing here
in the basement?

34:38.844 --> 34:41.078
I'm, uh...

34:41.080 --> 34:44.514
You know, I'm still trying
to learn the building.

34:44.516 --> 34:47.619
But I can't figure out
what this door is to.

34:48.987 --> 34:50.355
You can't be here.

34:52.056 --> 34:53.958
See the No Trespassing sign?

34:56.995 --> 34:59.530
Yeah, it's just...

34:59.532 --> 35:01.364
The door is not
on the blueprints,

35:01.366 --> 35:02.966
so I can't make
any sense of it.

35:02.968 --> 35:05.638
Yeah, that's for me
and Antonio. Okay?

35:06.972 --> 35:08.073
Move on.

35:12.878 --> 35:13.913
Move on.

35:41.974 --> 35:43.073
Hey!

35:43.075 --> 35:44.743
Hey! Hey!

35:47.113 --> 35:49.080
You feeding him?

35:49.082 --> 35:51.816
You can't feed him. You
need to get him out of here.

35:51.818 --> 35:53.019
Is he bothering you?

35:54.653 --> 35:57.055
He is a vagrant.

35:57.057 --> 35:59.960
Fuckin' British!

36:02.028 --> 36:03.429
Well, it's my house.

36:04.964 --> 36:08.632
Yeah, well, it's my
fuckin' neighborhood.

36:08.634 --> 36:12.038
And I don't want <i>that</i> hanging around
here, pissing on the sidewalks.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.976
Hey. Hey,
are you listening to me?

36:17.110 --> 36:20.011
Hey, I'm talking to you.

36:20.013 --> 36:21.715
- Are you listening to me?
- K <i>urt.</i>

36:22.949 --> 36:24.450
Listen to me. Hey.

36:26.186 --> 36:28.619
I'm fuckin' talking to you,
you fucking prick.

36:28.621 --> 36:32.190
Hey. I knew your parents.
They were good people.

36:32.192 --> 36:34.626
There were never any problems
when they were around.

36:34.628 --> 36:36.028
Now I've got all this
to fucking deal with.

36:36.030 --> 36:37.597
Hey!

36:43.670 --> 36:45.069
Hey.

36:45.071 --> 36:46.973
What's your problem,
you prick?

37:19.673 --> 37:20.907
<i>We must build shelter...</i>

37:22.643 --> 37:23.911
<i>gather food,</i>

37:24.912 --> 37:26.547
<i>arm ourselves.</i>

37:28.950 --> 37:31.018
<i>We have to disappear
from society.</i>

37:31.886 --> 37:32.887
<i>No trace.</i>

37:34.822 --> 37:38.691
<i>Close our bank accounts,
cancel our credit cards.</i>

37:38.693 --> 37:40.292
<i>Get rid of all
the material goods</i>

37:40.294 --> 37:42.196
<i>that are not needed
in our real lives.</i>

37:43.864 --> 37:47.599
<i>Not depend on technology
or electrical power.</i>

37:47.601 --> 37:50.938
<i>Only in this way we'll be strong
enough to endure the apocalypse.</i>

38:00.881 --> 38:02.315
Sweet, huh?

38:02.317 --> 38:05.985
No, come on. Can't you
see her boobs are fake?

38:05.987 --> 38:08.053
They look real to me.
But they are not.

38:08.055 --> 38:10.790
Okay, let's go. I mean,
Gomez will kill us, okay?

38:10.792 --> 38:13.193
Okay. You're
officially a pussy.

38:13.195 --> 38:16.096
She's a grown-up woman,
okay? This is legal.

38:16.098 --> 38:17.831
I might be a pussy,

38:17.833 --> 38:21.301
but I'll keep my job and
my life, so close that up.

38:21.303 --> 38:23.970
What eye are you using, man?
Look at this <i>cuerpo.</i>

38:23.972 --> 38:26.139
I'm leaving.
Go, go, go.

38:26.141 --> 38:28.274
Get out of here,
you pussy.

38:28.276 --> 38:30.709
Hey, new guy, come here.
Check this out.

38:30.711 --> 38:33.078
Don't be <i>maricón.</i>
Here. Huh?

38:33.080 --> 38:34.649
What are you doing
at my computer?

38:36.018 --> 38:36.985
Huh?

38:39.021 --> 38:40.587
We were just...
Oh, my God!

38:40.589 --> 38:42.591
- We were just looking.
- What the fuck?

38:43.358 --> 38:45.560
Yeah, just looking.

38:47.963 --> 38:50.098
What's your problem?
Get your ass out of here.

38:54.336 --> 38:55.969
God, I'm so embarrassed.

38:55.971 --> 38:58.740
You know, these pictures
are kind of old, and...

39:03.779 --> 39:05.014
What is this?

39:06.782 --> 39:08.950
Do you believe in this stuff?

39:18.361 --> 39:19.961
What are we listening for?

39:22.999 --> 39:24.333
There's no birds.

39:26.235 --> 39:27.703
It's like they all left.

39:33.076 --> 39:34.777
There are never birds
around here.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.214
Can I ask you
a question?

39:41.217 --> 39:44.253
Why not a triangle
or a square?

39:46.323 --> 39:48.958
Oh, you mean... Yeah,
the circle on your neck.

39:49.992 --> 39:51.627
I like circles.

39:53.996 --> 39:55.631
Sure, me too, but...

39:57.133 --> 39:58.334
what's-what's
the meaning?

39:59.268 --> 40:00.636
Emptiness.

40:03.039 --> 40:04.240
That's how I mostly feel.

40:08.144 --> 40:10.114
I guess my life
is pretty hollow.

40:12.950 --> 40:15.385
Well, you know, it's also
the number zero...

40:16.920 --> 40:18.754
which is like
a starting point.

40:20.690 --> 40:24.925
You know, the zero point, it
represents potential and growth.

40:24.927 --> 40:26.760
It's...

40:26.762 --> 40:28.232
It's like the embryo.

40:35.939 --> 40:37.207
You know who that guy is
down there?

40:39.209 --> 40:41.009
The one talking to Gomez?
Mm-hmm.

40:41.011 --> 40:42.112
No.

40:45.115 --> 40:46.717
You must be careful
with Gomez.

40:50.154 --> 40:51.321
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

40:52.256 --> 40:53.723
He does Daddy's dirty work.

40:57.961 --> 40:59.828
Hey.

40:59.830 --> 41:01.963
Haven't you turned on
the generator yet?

41:01.965 --> 41:04.067
I'm gonna get a coffee.
Great.

41:08.739 --> 41:11.507
I'm sorry. What was your question?
The generator.

41:11.509 --> 41:13.509
We have a generator?

41:13.511 --> 41:17.245
The power goes out,
the generator gets turned on.

41:17.247 --> 41:20.081
It's your job to make that
happen, Mr. Maintenance.

41:20.083 --> 41:21.451
Copy that.

41:22.954 --> 41:25.888
Be careful there
with the boss's daughter.

41:25.890 --> 41:29.160
Don't get the wrong idea. You
can look, but you can't touch.

41:30.128 --> 41:31.362
I'm watching you.

41:34.299 --> 41:35.300
Yeah, sure.

41:37.468 --> 41:38.936
Move on, smart guy.

41:43.040 --> 41:45.840
<i>Darkness lurks everywhere.</i>

41:45.842 --> 41:48.144
<i>And every shadow
has a face.</i>

41:48.146 --> 41:51.483
<i>When you look into darkness,
darkness looks into you.</i>

41:52.183 --> 41:54.016
Hey.

41:54.018 --> 41:57.220
I fuckin' know you.

41:57.222 --> 42:00.056
You're the faggot
from last time.

42:00.058 --> 42:02.961
You shaved your beard, but you're
still a faggot.

42:06.898 --> 42:08.066
I've been thinking
about you.

42:10.236 --> 42:11.403
And looking for you too.

42:13.805 --> 42:14.939
I was thinking
about how...

42:16.508 --> 42:18.575
last time, I should have
fucking blown your brains out.

42:18.577 --> 42:20.346
I let you live.

42:21.179 --> 42:22.446
Yeah, fucking lunacy.

42:22.448 --> 42:24.448
So I'm glad I fucking
ran into you, man.

42:24.450 --> 42:26.951
Yeah. Yeah.

42:29.153 --> 42:30.388
Baby-faced
motherfucker. What...

42:36.929 --> 42:38.962
No, man!

43:02.622 --> 43:05.991
<i>It just feels like
the same fire and blood and death.</i>

43:08.628 --> 43:10.029
<i>I have to be prepared.</i>

43:25.078 --> 43:27.211
Do not doubt your strength.

43:27.213 --> 43:29.416
If you fail the test,
I will test it again.

43:34.019 --> 43:36.287
We must all be strong
together.

43:36.289 --> 43:38.989
One alone does not work.

43:38.991 --> 43:41.860
How can one alone
repopulate the planet?

43:43.028 --> 43:45.431
Oh. Hello.

43:46.567 --> 43:49.500
They're decorating
now too, huh?

43:49.502 --> 43:52.637
You know, I need to do something
about them before it's too late.

43:52.639 --> 43:56.142
Well, at least
they are consistent.

43:58.078 --> 44:00.313
This is the only way
they see to get attention.

44:02.082 --> 44:03.681
No, that's crazy.

44:03.683 --> 44:07.185
People like that, you know,
they never change, man.

44:07.187 --> 44:08.455
They're like
hungry dogs.

44:09.589 --> 44:11.191
They may be in denial.

44:15.128 --> 44:16.994
And you?

44:16.996 --> 44:19.397
You are the reluctant
hero of course.

44:19.399 --> 44:21.500
I get it.
You've been through hell.

44:21.502 --> 44:24.904
And self-destruction is a hell of a
lot easier than taking responsibility.

44:28.375 --> 44:31.244
Make yourself healthy.
Try it.

44:33.480 --> 44:35.316
We are leaving in three days.

44:36.317 --> 44:39.551
Come. Come with us.
No.

44:39.553 --> 44:41.455
And find yourself a girl,
for God's sake.

44:42.490 --> 44:43.722
Hey!

44:43.724 --> 44:45.391
There's one now.
Good to see you.

44:45.393 --> 44:47.393
What... What are you
doing here?

44:47.395 --> 44:49.994
I was looking for you.

44:51.298 --> 44:53.264
Just a joke.

44:53.266 --> 44:55.636
What's going on?
Did I interrupt?

44:57.270 --> 45:00.339
Hey, uh, Noe,
do you know Jessica?

45:00.341 --> 45:01.641
Jessica, this is Noe.

45:01.643 --> 45:04.278
Yes, I know him.
He's the preacher.

45:07.481 --> 45:08.382
What's happening?

45:10.184 --> 45:13.053
Did you somehow
plan this, preacher?

45:14.755 --> 45:16.157
I'm not a preacher.

45:24.766 --> 45:26.334
Do you mind if I stay?

45:27.402 --> 45:28.701
Course not.

45:28.703 --> 45:31.471
You see the world
around you.

45:31.473 --> 45:33.773
You all know what's
happening as well as I do.

45:54.095 --> 45:56.997
<i>The only law in times
like this is the law of survival.</i>

45:58.233 --> 46:01.601
<i>And survival means preparation.</i>

46:01.603 --> 46:06.406
<i>In the coming storm, there will be those
who will fall prey to their bodies,</i>

46:06.408 --> 46:08.477
<i>others who will be
like terrified animals.</i>

46:11.112 --> 46:13.681
<i>We must remain lucid</i>

46:13.683 --> 46:16.184
<i>and be prepared
for the worst of humanity.</i>

46:49.585 --> 46:52.853
<i>A nuclear world
war will be catastrophic,</i>

46:52.855 --> 46:55.622
<i>not only for the direct deaths
that could ensue</i>

46:55.624 --> 46:58.060
<i>but also due to the collapse
of certain...</i>

47:03.566 --> 47:04.632
I told you.

47:04.634 --> 47:06.800
He leaves now.

47:06.802 --> 47:08.771
If you don't deal with it,
then I'm gonna...

47:24.320 --> 47:26.755
Take it.
Keep him off my property.

47:36.732 --> 47:41.635
<i>I feel like
the end is nearly upon us.</i>

47:41.637 --> 47:46.374
<i>I can't explain it,
but it's almost a relief.</i>

47:46.376 --> 47:48.310
<i>A lot of media commentators</i>

47:48.312 --> 47:52.781
<i>are speaking about the
possibility of a war breaking out,</i>

47:52.783 --> 47:56.318
<i>and have contemplated
the use of nuclear weapons</i>

47:56.320 --> 47:58.720
<i>sent against
civilian populations.</i>

47:58.722 --> 48:02.657
<i>Thank you so much for the
time that you've spent with us in this.</i>

48:02.659 --> 48:06.795
<i>Now... millions march
decrying police violence.</i>

48:06.797 --> 48:11.399
<i>12,795 days.</i>

48:11.401 --> 48:14.235
<i>People don't understand
what's coming.</i>

48:14.237 --> 48:16.738
<i>Still going about
their lives in denial.</i>

48:19.576 --> 48:23.244
<i>I gotta finish my bunker
as soon as possible.</i>

48:23.246 --> 48:24.848
Well, this is fucking insane.

48:28.885 --> 48:31.853
I mean...

48:31.855 --> 48:34.359
What the fuck is this? What the
hell are you even doing here?

48:38.863 --> 48:40.197
Preparing.

48:42.299 --> 48:43.433
Preparing?

48:44.702 --> 48:46.603
For what, the apocalypse?

48:47.972 --> 48:50.472
And why? Because some
moody old man says so?

48:50.474 --> 48:51.876
A fucking scammer?

48:53.945 --> 48:56.911
Kurt, can't you just tell
he's acting the whole time?

48:56.913 --> 48:59.384
You know what they should do? They
should give him an Academy Award.

49:02.587 --> 49:05.254
You have any idea how crazy
all this shit looks? Dude.

49:05.256 --> 49:07.423
I know
things have been tough.

49:07.425 --> 49:08.891
I know that.
But they're looking up.

49:08.893 --> 49:10.793
You got a girl,
you got a job.

49:10.795 --> 49:12.497
Why not just see
how things turn out?

49:14.465 --> 49:16.866
You don't understand.

49:16.868 --> 49:19.236
Damn fuckin' right I don't understand.
Who would?

49:24.542 --> 49:28.279
Listen to me. Kurt, you're destroying
the house where you grew up.

49:32.684 --> 49:34.583
Do you hear me?

49:34.585 --> 49:36.419
Stop what you're doing.
Listen to me for a second.

49:36.421 --> 49:38.621
Hey. Listen to me.

49:38.623 --> 49:40.758
You sold the couch
on which your old man died.

49:42.460 --> 49:44.760
Okay? The one where he waited
for you to come home,

49:44.762 --> 49:46.865
and everybody told him
that you were killed in the war.

49:48.400 --> 49:49.601
He never believed that.

49:51.537 --> 49:52.838
And one day, you show up.

49:55.574 --> 49:56.942
What were his last words, Kurt?

49:58.777 --> 49:59.945
"Brave.

50:01.714 --> 50:02.948
You must be brave."

50:04.515 --> 50:07.416
Yo. Don't you ever talk
about my father again.

50:07.418 --> 50:09.519
You understand me?

50:09.521 --> 50:12.422
Come on, buddy. You cannot ignore the
fact that you come home from the war,

50:12.424 --> 50:14.658
you lose your dad the next day
and your mom two months later.

50:14.660 --> 50:16.962
It's a huge burden for a
19-year-old boy, don't you think?

50:18.897 --> 50:21.898
Honestly, if you're asking me,
none of this shit makes any sense.

50:21.900 --> 50:24.737
I think you're fucking
cracking, buddy.

50:26.538 --> 50:29.906
I really think you are.

50:29.908 --> 50:32.341
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
What's that?

50:32.343 --> 50:34.511
Okay. Okay, a drink!
Whoo!

50:34.513 --> 50:36.914
Let's have a drink. You and
me, like old times, okay?

50:36.916 --> 50:37.984
Let's do this.

50:44.456 --> 50:46.389
No, no, no. What...
What are you doing?

50:46.391 --> 50:48.859
No! Oh, Kurt... Are you
fucking kidding me?

50:48.861 --> 50:50.427
That's, you know...
It's official.

50:50.429 --> 50:51.728
You've lost it, man.
You're a lunatic.

50:54.900 --> 50:55.868
Actually...

50:57.670 --> 50:59.003
things are finally
making sense.

50:59.005 --> 51:00.306
Oh, are they?

51:02.442 --> 51:03.376
Yeah.

51:04.611 --> 51:06.544
And speaking of,

51:06.546 --> 51:08.913
what's your deal with this kid
that keeps roaming around my house?

51:08.915 --> 51:10.315
You talked to him
about me?

51:11.785 --> 51:14.417
What the fuck are you talking about?
Which kid?

51:14.419 --> 51:17.521
You know, a little kid.
Like, yay tall.

51:17.523 --> 51:19.523
Creepy as fuck.

51:19.525 --> 51:21.494
Okay, I'll try to keep
an eye out for him.

51:22.062 --> 51:23.363
Yeah, do that.

51:28.968 --> 51:30.503
What the fuck
are even you doing?

51:47.788 --> 51:48.889
You gonna get that?

51:54.661 --> 51:56.694
Shh.

51:56.696 --> 51:58.496
Kurt, are you there?
Hi.

51:58.498 --> 52:00.665
Do me a favor, would ya?
Fucking stop doing that.

52:00.667 --> 52:02.968
Oh, come on!

52:02.970 --> 52:05.037
Are you sure you wanna let her in?
Kurt, it's me, Jessica.

52:05.039 --> 52:06.071
You know...

52:06.073 --> 52:07.705
- Fuck off!
- What?

52:07.707 --> 52:09.408
Tear down one of these walls,
fresh coat of paint,

52:09.410 --> 52:10.943
and you got a lovely
little bachelor pad.

52:10.945 --> 52:13.612
Kurt! It's me!

52:13.614 --> 52:15.147
Open up.
I know you're there.

52:15.149 --> 52:16.083
Fuck!

52:17.117 --> 52:18.452
I can hear you.

52:22.556 --> 52:23.755
For Christ's sake.

52:23.757 --> 52:25.423
Oh, yeah, definitely
cover these up.

52:28.461 --> 52:31.462
Yeah, there you go. Hey, aren't
you forgetting something?

52:32.766 --> 52:34.533
Kurt, what are you doing?
There you go.

52:34.535 --> 52:36.903
Open the door. Usually,
I like to ask a girl to dinner

52:36.905 --> 52:38.938
before showing her
my bunker.

52:38.940 --> 52:40.939
Please, man, shut up.

52:40.941 --> 52:43.042
It's a penis joke.

52:43.044 --> 52:45.113
- Just open the fucking door!
- Also, just a detail.

52:47.615 --> 52:49.514
Might wanna take off
that creepy fucking mask.

52:49.516 --> 52:52.818
All right. Go now!

52:52.820 --> 52:54.753
- All right, I'm going.
- Please, Johnny, go!

52:54.755 --> 52:56.123
Fuck.
Johnny, be good.

52:58.159 --> 53:00.862
Jesus, Kurt, I know you're in there.
Open up.

53:16.211 --> 53:17.478
Jesus.

53:33.028 --> 53:34.062
Where have you been?

53:35.196 --> 53:36.765
You're making my dad
nervous.

53:37.666 --> 53:38.633
Home.

53:41.269 --> 53:42.737
What the fuck?

53:43.939 --> 53:45.775
- You sleep in here?
- Uh-huh.

53:51.147 --> 53:54.048
There's trouble, Kurt.
Money's gone missing.

53:54.050 --> 53:55.550
A lot of money.

53:59.888 --> 54:01.823
- So?
- So?

54:03.658 --> 54:05.992
So I overheard
my father and Gomez.

54:05.994 --> 54:08.962
Daddy was raving, throwing
around accusations.

54:08.964 --> 54:11.966
It was a lot of money, Kurt.
A lot.

54:11.968 --> 54:14.503
And in the middle of it,
Gomez mentioned your name.

54:15.571 --> 54:16.538
Okay.

54:17.039 --> 54:17.940
"Okay"?

54:18.741 --> 54:20.142
So?
So.

54:21.543 --> 54:22.812
Jesus, Kurt.

54:24.814 --> 54:26.514
Look at this place.

54:28.918 --> 54:30.086
Huh?

54:30.852 --> 54:31.853
What is this?

54:32.821 --> 54:34.224
What the fuck
is this?

54:37.127 --> 54:39.729
What are you doing here?
Are you building a fortress?

54:42.865 --> 54:43.966
Kurt.

54:51.607 --> 54:52.975
If you took
the money...

54:54.710 --> 54:55.978
we can fix this.

54:57.147 --> 54:58.115
Okay?

54:59.582 --> 55:00.817
I didn't take the money.

55:05.188 --> 55:06.256
Swear to me.

55:07.991 --> 55:09.292
Swear that
you didn't take it.

55:12.962 --> 55:16.297
Come on, Kurt. I need
the truth, you know?

55:16.299 --> 55:18.567
Swear to me.
I need to know.

55:22.906 --> 55:24.007
Swear to me.

55:25.876 --> 55:27.044
Yeah, I swear.

55:46.064 --> 55:47.329
I promise.

55:47.331 --> 55:49.032
Mm-hmm?
Mm-hmm.

55:50.067 --> 55:51.302
You really do?

56:04.247 --> 56:05.649
I promise.

56:07.384 --> 56:09.620
You sure? Yeah?

56:11.856 --> 56:12.990
Swear to me.

56:13.791 --> 56:15.991
Swear it. Yeah?

56:15.993 --> 56:18.160
Yeah, all this stuff
I paid for myself.

56:18.162 --> 56:20.695
Yeah? Are you sure?
You're not lying to me?

56:20.697 --> 56:22.066
No, I'll never lie to you.

56:30.208 --> 56:32.140
What's that? It's nothing.
It's nothing.

56:32.142 --> 56:33.077
No?

58:03.235 --> 58:06.772
So, when was the last time
you had a woman?

58:09.876 --> 58:10.944
Long time.

58:15.281 --> 58:16.748
Could you tell?

58:22.355 --> 58:23.456
Yeah, right.

58:28.428 --> 58:30.028
Just...

58:31.431 --> 58:32.966
You're not
a very good liar.

58:35.301 --> 58:36.869
No, it was just very...

58:38.304 --> 58:39.772
very intense.

58:42.208 --> 58:44.542
I mean,
I like to be wanted.

58:44.544 --> 58:46.946
This feels different though.

58:50.316 --> 58:51.783
Do I scare you?

58:58.559 --> 59:00.992
Well...

59:00.994 --> 59:03.530
You did sell
all of your furniture...

59:05.031 --> 59:07.398
spent all of your savings,

59:07.400 --> 59:10.403
and turned your house
into a bunker.

59:15.008 --> 59:16.442
You're pretty special.

59:22.149 --> 59:23.917
Go open that closet
right there.

59:25.119 --> 59:26.253
Hmm?

59:27.554 --> 59:30.391
There's a false door
behind that shelf.

59:31.225 --> 59:32.359
Go open it up.

59:36.162 --> 59:37.431
You serious?
Yeah.

59:47.007 --> 59:48.375
You gotta open up
the hatch.

01:00:05.559 --> 01:00:06.859
What is this?

01:00:09.531 --> 01:00:11.631
It's okay.

01:00:11.633 --> 01:00:13.335
There's no monsters
down there.

01:00:40.562 --> 01:00:42.395
- So?
- She's been there for an hour.

01:00:42.397 --> 01:00:44.630
Kid's got some
serious fucking <i>pelotas.</i>

01:00:44.632 --> 01:00:47.065
Bangin' the boss's daughter
after stealing him?

01:00:47.067 --> 01:00:48.336
You think she helped him
take the money?

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:52.037
I'm not paid to speculate.

01:00:52.039 --> 01:00:55.175
- What do we do then, boss?
- We wait in the car.

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:20.502
That's some setup
down there.

01:01:26.542 --> 01:01:28.377
There's not enough water
for two.

01:01:32.113 --> 01:01:33.516
You plan on joining me?

01:01:36.418 --> 01:01:39.421
Unless you want me to fend
for myself in the wasteland.

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:43.491
No, I mean...

01:01:45.194 --> 01:01:47.029
I don't wanna die
out there alone.

01:01:51.066 --> 01:01:52.668
You can't tell anybody
about this.

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:56.603
Sure. I won't tell.
No one.

01:01:56.605 --> 01:01:58.140
Absolutely no one.

01:02:04.713 --> 01:02:07.550
Don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

01:02:09.453 --> 01:02:11.287
Nobody ever listens to me
anyway.

01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:15.191
Yeah.

01:02:16.693 --> 01:02:18.160
Not even my dad.

01:02:20.062 --> 01:02:22.162
He doesn't take me seriously.

01:02:22.164 --> 01:02:24.164
I'm just his little doll,
you know?

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:35.045
Thank you.

01:02:37.113 --> 01:02:38.548
I'm sorry. I'm...

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:42.584
I'm dumping a lot
on you, aren't I?

01:02:42.586 --> 01:02:45.221
I should have saved daddy
issues for the third date.

01:02:48.425 --> 01:02:50.594
Anyway, I...

01:02:52.228 --> 01:02:54.463
I haven't told them
where you live.

01:02:55.565 --> 01:02:57.367
But they will
find you, Kurt.

01:02:58.769 --> 01:03:00.738
And Gomez is very
dangerous, you know?

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:04.508
I can handle him.

01:03:08.578 --> 01:03:10.845
Let me ask you a question.
Don't take it personal, okay?

01:03:10.847 --> 01:03:13.648
Shut up, you moron.
She's leaving now.

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:15.084
Okay, I'll follow her, boss.
Wait.

01:03:16.286 --> 01:03:18.388
Keep a distance.
She's not stupid.

01:03:33.403 --> 01:03:34.504
It's been reinforced.

01:03:35.505 --> 01:03:36.807
- Check the window.
- Yeah.

01:03:43.413 --> 01:03:44.815
There's a metal plate
behind the glass.

01:03:45.616 --> 01:03:46.717
What?

01:03:48.119 --> 01:03:49.453
It's a fucking fortress.

01:03:53.758 --> 01:03:56.124
Listen, kid.

01:03:56.126 --> 01:03:58.663
We just want to ask you a few questions.
That's all.

01:04:00.665 --> 01:04:04.267
Oh, please, don't make this
worse than it has to be.

01:04:08.171 --> 01:04:09.873
Now, listen to me,
you stupid shit.

01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:13.375
I know you took the money,
and I'm gonna get it back.

01:04:13.377 --> 01:04:17.114
This could mean a civil bloody
conversation over a cup of tea...

01:04:18.649 --> 01:04:21.450
or I end up nailing your
goddamn kneecaps to the floor,

01:04:21.452 --> 01:04:23.487
remembering the good
old days, right?

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.828
Go back to the car.
Okay, boss.

01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:37.734
Or maybe... just maybe...

01:04:37.736 --> 01:04:40.572
it means I pay a little visit
to your girlfriend.

01:04:42.406 --> 01:04:44.710
Oh, fuck, I know
she's the boss's daughter.

01:04:45.811 --> 01:04:47.578
But then, he'd never know.

01:04:53.584 --> 01:04:55.753
I could make sure
he never knew.

01:05:01.526 --> 01:05:02.926
Oh, poor daddy.

01:05:02.928 --> 01:05:05.395
The fucking things
I could do

01:05:05.397 --> 01:05:07.564
to that little,
tiny, tight,

01:05:07.566 --> 01:05:10.435
maybe-not-so-wet
cooze.

01:05:18.744 --> 01:05:20.211
Guess you're in deep shit.

01:05:21.681 --> 01:05:24.381
Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
don't give me that look.

01:05:24.383 --> 01:05:27.250
Don't give me that look. I told
you not to listen to that prophet.

01:05:27.252 --> 01:05:29.252
I told you building
a fuckin' bunker was twisted,

01:05:29.254 --> 01:05:32.656
not to mention what it does to
the resale value of your house.

01:05:32.658 --> 01:05:34.591
You wanna barricade yourself
from the world,

01:05:34.593 --> 01:05:36.860
but you may as well draw a
fucking target on your chest,

01:05:36.862 --> 01:05:38.294
'cause these guys are real.

01:05:38.296 --> 01:05:40.730
Kurt, listen to me.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:05:40.732 --> 01:05:43.466
You're trading
your heroes for ghosts.

01:05:43.468 --> 01:05:46.737
That's a line
from a song, yeah?

01:05:46.739 --> 01:05:48.939
Yeah. I thought it sounded good
for a bit of drama.

01:05:48.941 --> 01:05:50.376
Sounded better in my head
though.

01:05:51.444 --> 01:05:52.645
Great song though, right?

01:05:54.714 --> 01:05:56.749
Hey, hey. No, no. Where
are you going with that?

01:05:58.951 --> 01:06:00.385
To help a friend.

01:06:02.387 --> 01:06:04.587
Look, Kurt.

01:06:04.589 --> 01:06:06.322
You have to worry
about yourself, bro.

01:06:06.324 --> 01:06:08.759
You gotta get
your life back. Okay?

01:06:08.761 --> 01:06:09.830
I'm serious.

01:06:10.931 --> 01:06:12.432
That's ironic
coming from you.

01:06:14.267 --> 01:06:15.802
Shine on, you crazy diamond.

01:06:16.903 --> 01:06:18.504
I got a million of 'em.

01:06:27.847 --> 01:06:30.616
<i>12,796 days.</i>

01:06:32.619 --> 01:06:33.821
<i>Storms are constant.</i>

01:06:35.022 --> 01:06:36.788
<i>Tonight, Noe and his flock...</i>

01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:38.623
Come on!

01:06:38.625 --> 01:06:40.694
<i>...make their pilgrimage
to the mountains.</i>

01:06:41.929 --> 01:06:43.429
<i>I can't go with them.</i>

01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:45.598
<i>I'm on my own.</i>

01:06:47.767 --> 01:06:49.302
<i>But maybe I can
help see 'em off.</i>

01:06:56.409 --> 01:06:57.878
<i>The army took kids...</i>

01:06:59.413 --> 01:07:01.012
<i>put guns in their hands...</i>

01:07:01.014 --> 01:07:03.348
Oh, shit.
<i>...and told them what to shoot.</i>

01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:04.750
Where is the old cunt?

01:07:04.752 --> 01:07:05.853
<i>This is different.</i>

01:07:14.895 --> 01:07:16.462
Going somewhere,
old fella?

01:07:19.365 --> 01:07:21.002
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:24.103
What do you want?
Money?

01:07:28.042 --> 01:07:30.842
Night's come for you,
old man. What?

01:07:30.844 --> 01:07:34.481
Oh. Oh, you think
we're bargaining now? Now?

01:07:35.616 --> 01:07:37.749
Okay, okay.

01:07:37.751 --> 01:07:40.886
Give us all the fucking money
you have on your fucking bus,

01:07:40.888 --> 01:07:44.857
and maybe, maybe, if we
feel fucking charitable,

01:07:44.859 --> 01:07:47.760
we won't torture your
followers before we kill 'em.

01:07:47.762 --> 01:07:50.129
What do you think,

01:07:50.131 --> 01:07:53.966
your swastika is going
to make your skin tougher?

01:07:53.968 --> 01:07:56.401
It's still gonna bleed
when it's cut,

01:07:56.403 --> 01:07:59.138
and it will freeze
when it's cold.

01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:02.509
You piece-of-shit Jew.
I knew you'd pull this shit!

01:08:03.111 --> 01:08:05.443
Let's do plan B.

01:08:05.445 --> 01:08:07.379
That's where we
burn you all alive!

01:08:07.381 --> 01:08:09.651
No! No!

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:15.922
See, old man? See your
piece-of-shit friend?

01:08:15.924 --> 01:08:20.158
Look. Now get us the
fucking money, you old kike!

01:08:20.161 --> 01:08:23.095
What's it gonna be,
you stinking kike?

01:08:23.096 --> 01:08:24.863
Ain't nobody up there
gonna help you now.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.471
Move, motherfuck...

01:08:33.474 --> 01:08:34.607
What the fuck?

01:08:39.814 --> 01:08:40.983
There's someone
out there.

01:08:44.419 --> 01:08:46.786
- Get the fuck back.
- Watch him.

01:08:46.787 --> 01:08:49.557
What's happening now?
What's going on?

01:08:54.929 --> 01:08:57.096
- He... He came back.
- Where is he?

01:08:57.099 --> 01:08:58.600
He came back!
Shut the fuck up!

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:07.575
Get the fuck out!

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:11.779
Move out.

01:09:19.587 --> 01:09:21.587
I'm tired
of you, man.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:24.526
Everything you do
is wrong.

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:29.031
You have no clue.
No clue.

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:31.734
You don't even know
what's coming.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.606
Get the fuck
out of here.

01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:43.444
<i>I choke on familiar dread.</i>

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:46.883
<i>I'm terrified.</i>

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:51.921
<i>And not because of
the storms on the horizon.</i>

01:09:53.555 --> 01:09:56.558
<i>Not because I reject
Noe's salvation.</i>

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:02.829
<i>But because of how easy
it was to kill again.</i>

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:15.178
<i>Ventilation system
with radiation-cleaning mechanism.</i>

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.782
<i>Water tank
with filtration system.</i>

01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:22.052
<i>2.5 liters hydration pack.</i>

01:10:23.086 --> 01:10:25.253
<i>Chlorine tablets.</i>

01:10:25.255 --> 01:10:28.256
<i>Activated-charcoal
tablets.</i>

01:10:28.258 --> 01:10:31.027
<i>Light source supported
by a clean dynamo generator.</i>

01:10:32.529 --> 01:10:33.596
<i>Baking soda.</i>

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:36.067
<i>Isopropyl alcohol.</i>

01:10:36.967 --> 01:10:39.801
<i>Hydrogen peroxide.</i>

01:10:39.803 --> 01:10:41.671
<i>Sterile supply
of gauze and wraps.</i>

01:10:43.039 --> 01:10:45.709
<i>Antibiotic ointment.
Surgical stapler.</i>

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:47.844
<i>Suture kit.</i>

01:10:48.979 --> 01:10:50.513
<i>Lensatic compass.</i>

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.884
<i>Shortwave radio
and satellite phone.</i>

01:10:57.021 --> 01:10:58.689
<i>Very high density
protein food.</i>

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:02.059
<i>Nuts and dried meat.</i>

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.228
<i>Canned food.</i>

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:10.165
<i>Stay away from heavily flavored
or salted nuts.</i>

01:11:10.167 --> 01:11:14.571
<i>The amount of salt present in the unsalted
nut mixes is still sufficient enough...</i>

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:17.574
<i>to replace electrolytes.</i>

01:11:28.586 --> 01:11:29.653
Well, you were right.

01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:34.792
What an apocalyptic
fucking storm.

01:11:36.227 --> 01:11:39.596
And all over the world too.
It's unbelievable.

01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:46.271
You awake?

01:11:51.876 --> 01:11:54.612
First storm you sleep through
since the war, and it's...

01:11:55.746 --> 01:11:57.282
the biggest one
of all time.

01:12:05.156 --> 01:12:07.291
If you were awake, you'd
find that fucking hilarious.

01:12:33.252 --> 01:12:36.287
<i>12,797 days.</i>

01:13:04.816 --> 01:13:06.385
Kurt, please open up.

01:13:29.742 --> 01:13:32.278
<i>Brave. You must be brave.</i>

01:13:56.102 --> 01:13:59.805
Welcome...
to your new life.

01:14:02.475 --> 01:14:06.412
This...
is your new family.

01:14:27.534 --> 01:14:29.336
Oh. Fresh meat?

01:14:30.303 --> 01:14:31.438
Fresh meat?

01:14:33.006 --> 01:14:35.106
Fresh meat!

01:14:35.108 --> 01:14:37.242
Hey! Hey!
Hey you, new guy!

01:14:37.244 --> 01:14:38.977
Do you hear me? You're mine!

01:14:38.979 --> 01:14:41.048
Go back to your cell!

01:14:42.316 --> 01:14:45.317
Go back to your cell!
Go back to your...

01:14:45.319 --> 01:14:48.086
You're mine! Do you hear me?
You're mine! You're mine!

01:14:48.088 --> 01:14:50.188
Go back to your cell! You're mine!
You fresh meat!

01:14:50.190 --> 01:14:51.323
You're mine!

01:14:54.827 --> 01:14:57.029
You can't escape me!
You can't escape me!

01:14:57.031 --> 01:14:58.397
Shut up! Shut up!
I'm gonna get you!

01:15:05.038 --> 01:15:07.408
<i>I don't know
how many days it's been.</i>

01:15:09.943 --> 01:15:11.378
<i>And that's a problem
for someone like me.</i>

01:15:13.013 --> 01:15:15.814
<i>I know where I am though.</i>

01:15:15.816 --> 01:15:19.353
<i>This is where people get put
when they need to be forgotten.</i>

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:23.992
<i>There's something wrong
with me.</i>

01:15:25.326 --> 01:15:27.428
<i>But I don't think
I'm crazy.</i>

01:15:28.596 --> 01:15:29.998
<i>Not like this.</i>

01:15:41.342 --> 01:15:42.976
<i>But then I feel
the warmth...</i>

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:45.447
<i>of the sun.</i>

01:15:57.525 --> 01:16:02.830
Kurt, are you aware of the
seriousness of your situation?

01:16:05.633 --> 01:16:06.900
Probably not.

01:16:09.505 --> 01:16:13.873
Your file states a long
history of panic disorder,

01:16:13.875 --> 01:16:17.546
suicidal tendencies, possible
dissociative disorder.

01:16:21.015 --> 01:16:23.949
You were in treatment
for PTSD,

01:16:23.951 --> 01:16:25.384
but you stopped.

01:16:25.386 --> 01:16:27.186
And now...

01:16:28.956 --> 01:16:30.557
Murder charges.

01:16:37.633 --> 01:16:39.501
Your house was searched.

01:16:43.005 --> 01:16:44.406
The police found your...

01:16:46.308 --> 01:16:47.443
shelter.

01:16:54.048 --> 01:16:55.417
Ah. Hello.

01:16:58.421 --> 01:17:02.492
What they found is not
the home of a healthy man.

01:17:05.327 --> 01:17:07.062
I can help you, Kurt.

01:17:08.964 --> 01:17:11.166
But you have
to work with me.

01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:18.638
The police report indicated
that you'd become involved

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.509
with a man named Noe.

01:17:21.511 --> 01:17:24.212
A self-fashioned
doomsday prophet.

01:17:24.214 --> 01:17:26.547
His real name
is Allen Green.

01:17:26.549 --> 01:17:29.015
He was arrested
and convicted twice

01:17:29.017 --> 01:17:32.355
in the United States
for fraud since moving here.

01:17:39.128 --> 01:17:40.630
He's a con man, Kurt.

01:17:42.331 --> 01:17:43.499
Not a prophet.

01:17:44.534 --> 01:17:46.367
You are sick,

01:17:46.369 --> 01:17:49.337
and you've been clinging to
the ravings of a false prophet

01:17:49.339 --> 01:17:51.139
to reinforce your beliefs.

01:17:51.141 --> 01:17:53.510
The world is not ending.

01:17:58.681 --> 01:18:00.281
What about the storms?

01:18:00.283 --> 01:18:04.552
Yes, the scope was
historic, record-breaking.

01:18:04.554 --> 01:18:08.223
But we are talking about the
records of only 100 years.

01:18:08.225 --> 01:18:10.994
That's a drop in the bucket
of the history of our planet.

01:18:11.629 --> 01:18:13.697
Something is changing.

01:18:15.365 --> 01:18:17.999
But there is no more
evidence to suggest

01:18:18.001 --> 01:18:22.036
we are on the verge of a
sudden, cataclysmic ending

01:18:22.038 --> 01:18:24.607
than there is
to indicate we are not.

01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:29.110
And the storms
have ended.

01:18:29.112 --> 01:18:32.481
In your case, after the
trauma you've experienced,

01:18:32.483 --> 01:18:35.050
these kinds of delusions
are common.

01:18:35.052 --> 01:18:40.257
In fact, they are exactly what
men like Allen Green feed on.

01:18:48.031 --> 01:18:50.097
Now I'm going to go through
a checklist with you,

01:18:50.099 --> 01:18:52.302
and I need you
to answer honestly.

01:18:54.772 --> 01:18:56.739
First.

01:18:56.741 --> 01:19:02.279
Have you experienced any audio
or visual hallucinations?

01:19:04.548 --> 01:19:08.385
Kurt, are you listening to me?
It's important.

01:19:10.054 --> 01:19:13.355
Have you experienced any audio
or visual hallucinations?

01:19:14.592 --> 01:19:16.625
Don't listen to him.

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:19.095
He's just asking you these
questions to hear himself speak.

01:19:21.233 --> 01:19:22.200
Kurt.

01:19:30.341 --> 01:19:31.576
Tell him what you did.

01:19:33.177 --> 01:19:35.310
Tell him about the three nights
on the mountain.

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:37.479
Tell him
how many men you killed.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:39.483
Tell him
what we did together.

01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:42.620
It's you and me
against the world, buddy.

01:19:43.789 --> 01:19:45.423
I'm sure you oughta
know that by now.

01:19:50.862 --> 01:19:52.762
He's not gonna be
easy to crack.

01:19:52.764 --> 01:19:54.430
'Cause he's
fucking insane.

01:19:54.432 --> 01:19:56.699
I was robbed
by a fucking madman.

01:19:56.701 --> 01:19:59.269
How the hell am I supposed
to recover my money now?

01:19:59.271 --> 01:20:02.305
We have our people turning
the house upside down.

01:20:02.307 --> 01:20:05.608
If it's in there, we'll find it.
Give me some time.

01:20:05.610 --> 01:20:08.380
We have to use a task force
that doesn't involve us.

01:20:09.782 --> 01:20:12.482
Dead men
are not useful for me.

01:20:12.484 --> 01:20:14.252
I want my money first.

01:20:18.758 --> 01:20:20.625
And then you can do
whatever you want.

01:20:30.502 --> 01:20:32.805
I told you, I don't have
a fucking lawyer.

01:20:34.774 --> 01:20:37.276
Shut the fuck up,
loony!

01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:41.814
He's over there.

01:20:50.555 --> 01:20:51.824
How you doing?

01:20:58.297 --> 01:21:00.199
What's the matter? You look
like you've seen a ghost.

01:21:00.733 --> 01:21:01.767
No.

01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:05.705
No, not a ghost.

01:21:08.674 --> 01:21:10.209
Allen Green.

01:21:13.245 --> 01:21:17.180
Not a ghost.
Definitely not a prophet.

01:21:17.182 --> 01:21:20.454
Nothing special really. Just...
Just a professional hustler, yeah?

01:21:21.488 --> 01:21:23.222
Allen Green.

01:21:25.759 --> 01:21:28.760
You know, I can't believe I
actually bought into your bullshit.

01:21:28.762 --> 01:21:31.662
What are you doing here anyways? I thought
you'd be off in the mountains by now,

01:21:31.664 --> 01:21:34.565
like, hiding in a little cave
or something.

01:21:34.567 --> 01:21:37.835
Unfortunately, after
the incident in the park,

01:21:37.837 --> 01:21:41.340
the police confiscated our bus
and all the supplies on it.

01:21:42.775 --> 01:21:45.210
I myself
had to go into hiding.

01:21:45.212 --> 01:21:47.245
The reason for the disguise.

01:21:47.247 --> 01:21:48.815
Oh. Well, that's...
that's terrible.

01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:52.617
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:21:52.619 --> 01:21:55.489
What will you do?
How will you survive?

01:21:57.223 --> 01:22:00.725
Oh, right, yeah, I forgot.
You're a fucking survivalist.

01:22:00.727 --> 01:22:02.395
You saved our lives.

01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:09.001
Unfortunately, the men you
killed work for powerful people.

01:22:09.003 --> 01:22:11.736
Those guys collect money
for the guy you robbed.

01:22:11.738 --> 01:22:13.906
And to them,
I'm as guilty as you are.

01:22:13.908 --> 01:22:15.908
I didn't steal money
from anyone.

01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:19.444
How much money did you scam off all
the people that believed in you?

01:22:19.446 --> 01:22:21.782
I never scammed anybody,
Kurt.

01:22:22.783 --> 01:22:24.883
Storms are over, all right?

01:22:26.453 --> 01:22:28.720
They're done.

01:22:28.722 --> 01:22:31.826
And I'm in here,
stuck in a fucking loony bin.

01:22:35.362 --> 01:22:36.597
But you know what?

01:22:38.032 --> 01:22:39.765
This place is not so bad.

01:22:39.767 --> 01:22:43.769
The storms
are not done, Kurt.

01:22:43.771 --> 01:22:45.805
We're just in the eye
of the hurricane.

01:22:45.807 --> 01:22:48.473
It's a bit clinical maybe.

01:22:48.475 --> 01:22:51.244
But, you know,
what they lack in design...

01:22:52.846 --> 01:22:54.779
they really make up for
in service.

01:22:54.781 --> 01:22:56.949
You listen to me.

01:22:56.951 --> 01:23:02.388
The storms are not over. This is
merely the calm before the storm.

01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:07.359
These are the end of days, Kurt,
the end of days.

01:23:07.361 --> 01:23:08.794
You were destined
for more than this.

01:23:08.796 --> 01:23:12.598
Don't do this to yourself.
Don't do it.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:16.468
Who told you these things? Who
told you these things about me?

01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:19.840
That was in another life.
Forget it.

01:23:19.842 --> 01:23:22.441
I think it was that girl
you were seeing, her father.

01:23:22.443 --> 01:23:23.578
Forget it.
It's bullshit.

01:23:24.813 --> 01:23:28.547
You saved our lives,
you understand me?

01:23:28.549 --> 01:23:30.816
You saved our lives.
You stood up.

01:23:30.818 --> 01:23:33.586
You showed up. You showed
who you really were.

01:23:33.588 --> 01:23:36.856
Don't give it up now. Don't
sink back into that place.

01:23:36.858 --> 01:23:38.559
You are my hero.

01:23:45.701 --> 01:23:47.836
Fuck everybody else.
Fuck them.

01:23:50.906 --> 01:23:52.040
Okay.

01:23:53.008 --> 01:23:53.942
Okay. Okay.

01:23:55.376 --> 01:23:57.811
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

01:23:57.813 --> 01:23:59.413
I'm gonna
get you out of here.

01:24:00.648 --> 01:24:01.582
Okay?

01:24:02.985 --> 01:24:04.318
Calm down.

01:24:05.553 --> 01:24:06.788
I'm gonna calm down too.

01:24:10.759 --> 01:24:12.861
Okay.
Okay, get a grip.

01:24:13.962 --> 01:24:16.031
You get a grip.
Come on. Come on.

01:24:16.965 --> 01:24:18.098
You get a grip.

01:24:21.804 --> 01:24:24.137
You're mine! You're mine!

01:24:24.139 --> 01:24:27.707
Do you hear me, fresh meat?
You're mine! You're mine!

01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:30.510
Do you hear me, fresh meat?
You're mine!

01:24:30.512 --> 01:24:34.048
- You're my fucking fresh meat!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:24:48.164 --> 01:24:50.732
<i>Allen Green,
where are the storms?</i>

01:24:53.769 --> 01:24:54.670
Hey.

01:24:55.605 --> 01:24:56.539
Hey.

01:24:58.107 --> 01:25:01.911
What are you doing?
Huh?

01:25:05.481 --> 01:25:06.950
Huh?

01:25:09.052 --> 01:25:10.987
1,000 volts, motherfucker.

01:25:13.589 --> 01:25:15.024
You killed Romhess,
didn't you?

01:25:17.827 --> 01:25:18.862
Yeah.

01:25:27.670 --> 01:25:31.072
Gomez told us all about
that shit, you sick fuck.

01:25:31.074 --> 01:25:33.074
Get the fuck down!

01:25:33.076 --> 01:25:35.743
Get on your fucking knees. Get
on your fucking knees, man!

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.114
Yeah! Yeah!

01:25:40.116 --> 01:25:42.550
Yeah! Yeah!

01:25:42.552 --> 01:25:44.119
Fuck you, faggot!

01:25:50.928 --> 01:25:53.797
Fuckin'...

01:25:55.598 --> 01:25:56.799
Yeah.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.868
Come on!

01:26:01.938 --> 01:26:02.872
Thomas.

01:26:12.082 --> 01:26:15.784
You're fucking sweet... Fuck you.
Fucking nigger.

01:26:15.786 --> 01:26:18.620
...blond ass...

01:26:18.622 --> 01:26:21.657
...is mine. I'm gonna fucking kill you.
Fucking kike.

01:26:21.659 --> 01:26:23.926
I ain't no
fucking faggot!

01:26:42.113 --> 01:26:46.048
You are so lucky.

01:26:46.050 --> 01:26:50.585
Your lawyer
pulled some strings,

01:26:50.587 --> 01:26:53.190
so I could get you
out of here.

01:26:54.858 --> 01:26:58.094
But the deal
is only good for today.

01:26:58.096 --> 01:27:00.930
So, if I see you here
tomorrow,

01:27:00.932 --> 01:27:02.767
you are my new pet!

01:27:08.206 --> 01:27:11.307
Ooh! A Nazi.

01:27:11.309 --> 01:27:15.610
Always wanted me
one of them for a pet.

01:27:15.612 --> 01:27:17.313
Now get the fuck
out of here!

01:27:35.066 --> 01:27:36.735
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait.

01:27:37.702 --> 01:27:39.068
I'm here to help.

01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:41.204
The guards out front,
they're switching over.

01:27:41.206 --> 01:27:43.575
There's room for you to leave,
but you have to go now.

01:27:45.111 --> 01:27:47.945
So what, you're... you're
a double agent now?

01:27:47.947 --> 01:27:49.279
Needed a new line of work.

01:27:49.281 --> 01:27:51.716
Uh, here, for you.

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:55.185
What's this?

01:27:55.187 --> 01:27:58.155
It's from the preacher,
a change of clothes.

01:27:58.157 --> 01:28:00.592
You'll never get out of here
wearing the stuff you are now.

01:28:03.962 --> 01:28:05.628
That's a satellite phone.

01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:07.296
Something about the satellite
still being functional

01:28:07.298 --> 01:28:09.600
a while after the final storm.

01:28:09.602 --> 01:28:11.904
But you have to leave now,
okay? Please.

01:28:13.139 --> 01:28:15.806
Quick.
All right, thanks.

01:28:15.808 --> 01:28:17.743
Don't thank me.
Thank the preacher.

01:28:22.081 --> 01:28:25.182
You know where he is? He's
getting ready to leave.

01:28:25.184 --> 01:28:27.351
He said I should join him
after he's gone.

01:28:27.353 --> 01:28:28.954
But... Wait.

01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:32.125
Hit me.

01:28:34.361 --> 01:28:35.726
What?

01:28:35.728 --> 01:28:37.328
Don't fuck around, okay?

01:28:37.330 --> 01:28:39.299
You know those guys.
They'll kill me.

01:28:42.935 --> 01:28:43.969
Fuck.

01:29:06.725 --> 01:29:07.993
<i>They found my shelter.</i>

01:29:10.297 --> 01:29:11.964
<i>But, thank God,
not the bunker.</i>

01:29:39.426 --> 01:29:42.227
Are you fucking
kidding me?

01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:44.664
How the fuck could he escape
from that facility?

01:29:47.235 --> 01:29:50.169
Tell the police to not do
anything until I tell them.

01:29:50.171 --> 01:29:51.239
We'll take care of this.

01:29:53.073 --> 01:29:55.474
Listen, Gomez,
there's something else.

01:29:55.476 --> 01:29:59.811
I'm putting you in charge
of security detail for Jessica.

01:29:59.813 --> 01:30:04.082
I am worried about her
getting tangled up in this.

01:30:04.084 --> 01:30:05.785
Keep that nutjob away from her.

01:30:08.389 --> 01:30:10.923
I don't care
what she thinks about this.

01:30:10.925 --> 01:30:12.326
You just do what I command.

01:30:46.294 --> 01:30:48.093
You can't
just let it go, can you?

01:30:49.263 --> 01:30:50.730
Look at you.

01:30:53.301 --> 01:30:54.468
You know,
maybe she left.

01:30:56.871 --> 01:30:59.139
Maybe she gave up on you.
I don't know.

01:30:59.141 --> 01:31:01.374
Or maybe she was in on it. Who knows?
But you know what?

01:31:01.376 --> 01:31:03.943
You're gonna go out there, you're
gonna fucking get yourself killed.

01:31:03.945 --> 01:31:06.814
These guys are fucking dangerous, Kurt.
Do you not see that?

01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:14.456
You're fucking walking into a suicide
and you won't even look at me.

01:31:17.425 --> 01:31:18.326
Hey!

01:31:20.195 --> 01:31:21.330
Look at me!

01:31:23.932 --> 01:31:26.066
You don't have to put that coat on, okay?
Don't put that coat...

01:31:26.068 --> 01:31:27.801
You know what
we have to do?

01:31:27.803 --> 01:31:30.103
Even if the world doesn't end,
you could use a vacation.

01:31:30.105 --> 01:31:32.405
So what say you and me, we go
into the mountains, all right?

01:31:32.407 --> 01:31:34.076
We have a fucking break
of our own.

01:31:40.482 --> 01:31:41.983
I'm sorry, Johnny.

01:31:45.921 --> 01:31:47.256
I'm sorry I couldn't save you.

01:31:50.292 --> 01:31:51.793
I'm sorry
I couldn't save you.

01:31:58.967 --> 01:32:00.102
Bye, Johnny.

01:32:06.341 --> 01:32:07.243
Hey.

01:32:13.949 --> 01:32:15.385
Well, see you around?

01:32:18.421 --> 01:32:20.922
Yeah, on the dark side
of the moon.

01:32:36.205 --> 01:32:39.340
<i>...are forecasting
winds of up to 80 miles an hour</i>

01:32:39.342 --> 01:32:43.311
<i>and 60 inches of drenching rain
over the next 24 hours,</i>

01:32:43.313 --> 01:32:45.413
<i>like a world record.</i>

01:32:45.415 --> 01:32:50.117
<i>The emergency services have advised
taking shelter and keeping informed.</i>

01:32:50.119 --> 01:32:52.553
<i>This weather is totally
out of control,</i>

01:32:52.555 --> 01:32:54.424
<i>and there will be more
around the corner.</i>

01:33:01.164 --> 01:33:04.601
<i>Jessica told me she
didn't want to die alone in the cold.</i>

01:33:08.071 --> 01:33:09.305
<i>Neither do I.</i>

01:33:11.207 --> 01:33:12.442
What are you doing here?

01:33:15.111 --> 01:33:16.179
You have to go!

01:33:22.152 --> 01:33:25.053
He waited for you

01:33:25.055 --> 01:33:29.226
while everyone was telling him
that you were killed in war.

01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:33.362
But he never
believed that.

01:33:33.364 --> 01:33:35.632
Until one day,
you showed up.

01:33:37.334 --> 01:33:39.503
Brave.
You must be brave.

01:33:50.214 --> 01:33:51.915
My daddy told me that.

01:34:08.233 --> 01:34:10.966
It's just a matter of time,
boss. He's a lonely <i>puto.</i>

01:34:10.968 --> 01:34:13.137
Yes. If you give us just
one more day, we'll get him.

01:34:20.645 --> 01:34:22.411
Where's Jessica?

01:34:22.413 --> 01:34:24.747
Fucking great.

01:34:24.749 --> 01:34:28.550
I have paid half of the
fucking city to look for you,

01:34:28.552 --> 01:34:31.755
and you just fucking
waltz in my door.

01:34:31.757 --> 01:34:33.489
Look.
Nice.

01:34:33.491 --> 01:34:35.224
I really like
your daughter, okay?

01:34:35.226 --> 01:34:36.995
So I don't want
to have to shoot you.

01:34:37.495 --> 01:34:38.663
Oh.

01:34:40.365 --> 01:34:42.267
You do love my daughter, huh?

01:34:42.767 --> 01:34:44.734
Yes, sir.

01:34:44.736 --> 01:34:46.604
And I need to know
where she is right now.

01:34:56.449 --> 01:34:57.583
Shit happens.

01:34:59.652 --> 01:35:01.017
Don't fuck around!

01:35:01.019 --> 01:35:03.720
So, here you are,
you sick fuck.

01:35:03.722 --> 01:35:06.424
Calm down, Gomez.
Don't shoot.

01:35:07.358 --> 01:35:08.759
Where's Jessica?

01:35:08.761 --> 01:35:12.361
That's right.
Where the fuck is she?

01:35:12.363 --> 01:35:16.032
You're supposed to be watching her.
Yeah, yeah.

01:35:16.034 --> 01:35:19.136
But let me kill
this bloody thief first.

01:35:19.138 --> 01:35:22.073
I'm not a thief. All right?
I didn't take your money.

01:35:23.342 --> 01:35:25.342
I'm gonna reach into
my pocket now, okay?

01:35:25.344 --> 01:35:27.377
Hey, hey, don't move.
Don't move.

01:35:27.379 --> 01:35:30.481
Hey. Hey! Let him talk.

01:35:30.483 --> 01:35:32.549
I want you to hear
your friend here talk.

01:35:32.551 --> 01:35:34.185
You might have some
questions for him after.

01:35:35.186 --> 01:35:38.054
<i>Or maybe, just maybe,</i>

01:35:38.056 --> 01:35:41.625
<i>it means I pay a little visit
to your girlfriend.</i>

01:35:41.627 --> 01:35:44.096
<i>Oh, fuck, I know
she's the boss's daughter.</i>

01:35:45.197 --> 01:35:47.066
<i>But then, he'd never know.</i>

01:35:49.401 --> 01:35:51.504
<i>I could make sure
he never knew.</i>

01:35:53.506 --> 01:35:54.607
<i>Oh, poor daddy.</i>

01:35:56.642 --> 01:36:00.744
<i>The fucking things I could do
to that little, tiny, tight,</i>

01:36:00.746 --> 01:36:03.582
<i>maybe-not-so-wet cooze.</i>

01:36:06.652 --> 01:36:08.820
Hey. Hey.

01:36:08.822 --> 01:36:10.320
Come on.

01:36:10.322 --> 01:36:11.756
Come on.
You fucking robbed me!

01:36:11.758 --> 01:36:13.390
Come on!

01:36:13.392 --> 01:36:15.693
You saw
the security camera video.

01:36:15.695 --> 01:36:19.129
He was sneaking by the vault door.
He took the bloody money.

01:36:19.131 --> 01:36:22.800
Wait! There's a reasonable
explanation for everything.

01:36:22.802 --> 01:36:24.601
What is it?
Just tell me. Come on.

01:36:24.603 --> 01:36:26.238
It was just a tactic.

01:36:27.306 --> 01:36:29.373
I was working him over.

01:36:29.375 --> 01:36:31.342
Look at him.

01:36:31.344 --> 01:36:33.780
I mean, a guy like that...

01:36:36.516 --> 01:36:37.651
What the fuck
are you...

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.455
Fuck.

01:36:52.131 --> 01:36:53.165
Hey, kid.

01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:56.570
Find my daugh...

01:37:14.688 --> 01:37:18.656
<i>You ever wonder
how different life would be</i>

01:37:18.658 --> 01:37:21.827
<i>if certain things
never happened?</i>

01:37:21.829 --> 01:37:23.831
<i>You know, the things
that you don't want.</i>

01:37:26.467 --> 01:37:28.634
<i>And you gotta accept</i>

01:37:28.636 --> 01:37:32.840
<i>things you don't want to know
but you gotta learn.</i>

01:37:35.508 --> 01:37:39.310
<i>From our beginning,
it was clear that we were new.</i>

01:37:42.850 --> 01:37:45.486
<i>Power we held, and it grew.</i>

01:37:51.392 --> 01:37:53.260
<i>Until it grew
out of control.</i>

01:37:54.962 --> 01:37:56.731
<i>And now we're gliding
towards the end.</i>

01:38:00.801 --> 01:38:03.471
<i>All I've ever done
is survive.</i>

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.609
<i>And maybe that's all
anyone ever does.</i>

01:38:09.310 --> 01:38:10.378
<i>Until you don't.</i>

01:38:16.317 --> 01:38:19.387
<i>And then,
what dreams may come?</i>
