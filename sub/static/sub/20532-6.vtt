00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.543 --> 00:12.511
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.513 --> 00:14.880
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.882 --> 00:17.616
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.618 --> 00:19.385
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:19.387 --> 00:22.554
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.556 --> 00:25.290
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.292 --> 00:29.495
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.497 --> 00:32.698
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the First ¶

00:32.700 --> 00:36.668
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.670 --> 00:38.170
¶ Sofia the First ¶

00:38.172 --> 00:41.573
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:41.575 --> 00:42.908
¶ Sofia ¶

00:42.910 --> 00:45.477
-¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
-¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.479 --> 00:51.917
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the First ¶

00:57.591 --> 00:59.458
¶¶

01:03.497 --> 01:06.598
It's time to begin
Princess Sofia's training.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.235
She will be the first protector
of the EverRealm.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.571
It will be a great challenge
and a great honor

01:12.573 --> 01:14.740
for whomever
is sent to train her.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.775
As our leaders,
it is your decision.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.410
Who do you recommend?

01:18.412 --> 01:19.845
-Chrysta.
-What?

01:19.847 --> 01:21.213
That's impossible!

01:21.215 --> 01:23.348
Vega, you can't be serious.

01:23.350 --> 01:27.352
A task such as this requires
our most skilled protector,

01:27.354 --> 01:29.788
someone smart and fierce.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.791
Which is why we are choosing
Chrysta for this mission.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.793
Chrysta is a courageous fighter,

01:34.795 --> 01:37.096
but she is wild, Orion.

01:37.098 --> 01:39.398
And proud and overbearing.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.600
Pairing her with a princess?

01:41.602 --> 01:44.603
Not to mention she has
never trained anyone!

01:44.605 --> 01:47.773
She's far too tough
for a little girl like that.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.608
All right, I'm here.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.944
-Welcome, Chrysta.
-Hey, chiefs.

01:51.946 --> 01:54.213
So, what do you have
for me next?

01:56.717 --> 02:00.385
That is Princess Sofia.
She defeated Prisma

02:00.387 --> 02:02.454
and saved the Mystic Isles.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.556
Huh! Hard to believe.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.824
What's that got
to do with me?

02:05.826 --> 02:09.795
Princess Sofia has been chosen
as protector of the EverRealm.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.997
You are going
to be her trainer.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.500
Please tell me
you're joking.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.235
It is no joke.

02:16.237 --> 02:20.239
But no non-magical creature
has ever been a protector.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.808
Which is why she'll need
a strong trainer.

02:22.810 --> 02:26.011
Princess Sofia must get
her enchantlet by sundown,

02:26.013 --> 02:27.980
or she cannot become
a protector.

02:27.982 --> 02:31.850
But I'm no trainer, especially
for some pampered princess

02:31.852 --> 02:34.486
who can't put on her gown
without help from a maid!

02:34.488 --> 02:37.689
See? She's not up
for the job.

02:37.691 --> 02:38.991
I didn't say that.

02:38.993 --> 02:41.460
We will not order you
to do this, Chrysta.

02:41.462 --> 02:45.097
But for the sake
of the EverRealm,
we urge you to accept.

02:47.635 --> 02:50.669
Fine, I'll train her,
but don't blame me

02:50.671 --> 02:53.939
when this princess collapses
like a royal soufflé.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.476
Are you sure
about this?

02:57.478 --> 02:59.678
Chrysta would be tough
on any trainee,

02:59.680 --> 03:02.014
let alone
a non-magical princess.

03:02.016 --> 03:05.117
Oh, I believe this
non-magical princess

03:05.119 --> 03:06.985
may surprise us all.

03:06.987 --> 03:10.189
-( hoofbeats )
-( clatter )

03:10.191 --> 03:12.624
-( gasps ) What was that?
-( chiming )

03:12.626 --> 03:15.027
( neighing )

03:15.029 --> 03:18.730
Coachman? Oh, no!
Where's the coachman?

03:20.734 --> 03:23.769
Ah, you! Back!
Come here!

03:25.139 --> 03:27.839
SOFIA:
Whoa! Whoa, there! Stop!

03:27.841 --> 03:30.709
( neighing )

03:30.711 --> 03:33.845
Sorry to interrupt your trip
to the tea party, Princess.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.848
( gasps ) I've seen
one of those before.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.917
Are you a protector?

03:38.919 --> 03:40.719
Not just any protector,

03:40.721 --> 03:43.088
the best protector
in the Mystic Isles.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.556
The name's Chrysta.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.661
There! Good as new.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.929
Wow.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.864
So, you're the princess

03:52.866 --> 03:54.933
who wants to be
a protector, huh?

03:54.935 --> 03:57.502
Yes, that's me! Sofia.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.905
Well, this isn't gonna be
some royal cakewalk.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.873
It'll be hard work.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.875
You may want to lose
the silk gloves.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.945
Oh, sorry. I don't
normally dress like this.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.914
I've been really looking
forward to training.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.115
What do we do first?

04:10.117 --> 04:12.017
Okay, if you want
to be a protector,

04:12.019 --> 04:14.786
you gotta have
an enchantlet.

04:14.788 --> 04:15.787
( both snuffle )

04:15.789 --> 04:17.956
Really? I get one of those?

04:17.958 --> 04:21.393
You don't just get it.
You have to earn it!

04:21.395 --> 04:23.028
Oh, right. Of course.

04:23.030 --> 04:26.031
And you only have till the end
of the day to do it.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.734
If you don't get
your enchantlet by sundown,

04:28.736 --> 04:30.569
you don't get
to be a protector.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.038
First, we go
to the Isle of Forever Frost.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.941
That's where I'll train you
in some skills you'll need

04:35.943 --> 04:37.309
to get your enchantlet.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.744
Sounds great.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.946
The second part of the day
is the tough part.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.582
You'll have to put
those skills to the test--

04:43.584 --> 04:45.884
climb a glacier
all by your lonesome

04:45.886 --> 04:47.986
and get yourself
an enchantlet.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.454
Okay, I understand.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.757
Well, I'm not
so sure you do.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.992
The Isle of Forever Frost is

04:53.994 --> 04:55.927
a treacherous land
of ice and snow.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.796
I hope you're wearing
your warmest tiara.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.998
All right,
let's move out.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.737
Oh, right.
You can't fly.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.739
Let me call you
a unicorn.

05:14.081 --> 05:17.482
There we are,
the Isle of Forever Frost.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.418
Come on.
We're going this way.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.854
So, Chrysta,
who trained you to use
your enchantlet like that?

05:22.856 --> 05:24.289
Orion himself.

05:24.291 --> 05:27.326
Orion! Wow, that must be
why you're so good at it.

05:27.328 --> 05:30.362
Is it some kind
of magical rope?

05:30.364 --> 05:33.598
An enchantlet is
the number-one tool
of a protector.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.268
It can be magically formed
into a super-strong net

05:36.270 --> 05:39.004
or a lasso, or lots
of other things.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.606
You can even use it
to contact other protectors.

05:41.608 --> 05:43.875
Orion, Vega,
are you there, chiefs?

05:44.945 --> 05:47.045
Is everything
all right, Chrysta?

05:47.047 --> 05:48.980
Yes, sir.
Just checking in.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.183
We're pulling for you,
Princess Sofia.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.851
Thank you,
Mr. Giant!

05:52.853 --> 05:56.688
That's Garish,
the second-best protector
in the Isles.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.190
Oh, is that so!

05:58.192 --> 06:00.292
We'll see how well
you do with this training.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.896
Wow. Enchantlets
are amazing,

06:04.898 --> 06:06.565
just like my amulet.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.133
Oh, that reminds me.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.535
No using your amulet powers
on this quest.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.704
We're testing
what's inside you,

06:12.706 --> 06:15.907
not your amulet,
so no cheating.

06:15.909 --> 06:16.908
I promise.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.810
All right, let's
get on with this.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.011
What will I learn first?

06:20.013 --> 06:21.713
How to tame
a wild beast,

06:21.715 --> 06:24.583
or use an enchantlet
to climb a tree, maybe?

06:24.585 --> 06:25.884
Aah!

06:25.886 --> 06:27.486
You know what
I call that?

06:27.488 --> 06:28.987
Falling in the snow?

06:28.989 --> 06:32.157
I call it a chance to try out
your first protector skill,

06:32.159 --> 06:34.926
something you'll need
to get your enchantlet--

06:34.928 --> 06:36.061
feather walking.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.429
What is feather walking?

06:37.431 --> 06:38.897
I'm doing it now.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.099
It's a matter
of muscle control and focus.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.935
You can use it to cross ice
or snow or fire ice...

06:43.937 --> 06:46.171
I'm ready.
What do I do first?

06:46.173 --> 06:49.074
Put your feet down
as gently as possible,

06:49.076 --> 06:52.544
and float over the surface,
light as can be.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.780
Now you try it, Princess!

06:54.782 --> 06:56.281
That's the whole lesson?

06:56.283 --> 06:57.382
That's right!

06:57.384 --> 06:59.184
Okay.

07:00.287 --> 07:03.455
Come on, now!
Gentle footsteps!

07:05.225 --> 07:06.892
( sighs )

07:06.894 --> 07:10.962
( straining )

07:10.964 --> 07:13.064
Oh!

07:13.066 --> 07:14.800
I think I'm getting better!

07:14.802 --> 07:16.067
Why are you yelling?

07:16.069 --> 07:18.603
Oh, hi! I thought
you were over there.

07:18.605 --> 07:22.107
I know you're more used
to feather pillows
than feather walking,

07:22.109 --> 07:24.242
but you're just
not getting it.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.777
Show me again?

07:25.779 --> 07:28.814
Oh, you had three tries!
I learned it in two.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.416
-But I'm--
-Look, you get
no special treatment

07:31.418 --> 07:33.618
just because
you're a princess.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.153
¶ This kind of training ¶

07:35.155 --> 07:37.389
¶ Can be so draining ¶

07:37.391 --> 07:41.426
¶ Especially
for someone like you ¶

07:41.428 --> 07:43.261
¶ A little royal ¶

07:43.263 --> 07:45.397
¶ Probably spoiled ¶

07:45.399 --> 07:48.633
¶ Such hard work
must be something new ¶

07:48.635 --> 07:50.602
¶ This job is not a parade ¶

07:50.604 --> 07:52.938
¶ It can be risky and rough ¶

07:52.940 --> 07:54.806
¶ You can't just ring
for the maid ¶

07:54.808 --> 07:56.842
¶ You've got to have
the right stuff ¶

07:56.844 --> 07:58.643
¶ If you want to succeed ¶

07:58.645 --> 08:01.413
¶ Protectors all have to be ¶

08:01.415 --> 08:03.949
¶ Tough enough,
tough enough ¶

08:03.951 --> 08:05.650
¶ Tough enough ¶

08:05.652 --> 08:07.285
¶ The girl that you see ¶

08:07.287 --> 08:09.454
¶ Is not the true me ¶

08:09.456 --> 08:13.258
¶ It's just a picture
in your mind ¶

08:13.260 --> 08:15.327
¶ Of someone frilly ¶

08:15.329 --> 08:17.429
¶ Of someone silly ¶

08:17.431 --> 08:20.866
¶ But I am nothing
of the kind ¶

08:20.868 --> 08:22.868
¶ I am resourceful
and strong ¶

08:22.870 --> 08:24.636
¶ And when I climb
up that bluff ¶

08:24.638 --> 08:26.705
¶ You'll see
you got me all wrong ¶

08:26.707 --> 08:28.840
¶ I'll prove
I've got the right stuff ¶

08:28.842 --> 08:30.809
¶ Then I'll pass this exam ¶

08:30.811 --> 08:33.211
¶ 'Cause I know
that I am ¶

08:33.213 --> 08:36.047
¶ Tough enough,
tough enough ¶

08:36.049 --> 08:37.516
¶ Tough enough ¶

08:37.518 --> 08:40.819
¶ I'm tough enough ¶

08:40.821 --> 08:45.023
¶ But you will have to be more
than just a soft powder puff ¶

08:45.025 --> 08:46.892
¶ Well, you can doubt
all you want ¶

08:46.894 --> 08:49.060
¶ And be all grumpy
and gruff ¶

08:49.062 --> 08:51.062
¶ But when I take a stand ¶

08:51.064 --> 08:53.565
¶ You will see that I am ¶

08:53.567 --> 08:55.567
¶ Tough enough,
tough enough ¶

08:55.569 --> 08:57.669
¶ I'm tough enough ¶

08:57.671 --> 08:59.871
¶ Tough enough,
tough enough ¶

08:59.873 --> 09:01.473
¶ Are you tough enough ¶

09:01.475 --> 09:03.875
BOTH: ¶ Tough enough ¶

09:03.877 --> 09:07.345
¶ Are you tough enough ¶

09:07.347 --> 09:09.180
I got it!

09:09.182 --> 09:10.815
Not quite.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.818
Light as a feather...

09:13.820 --> 09:15.320
Uh, focus.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.322
Oh! Too-- whoa!

09:17.324 --> 09:19.824
Chrysta, is everything
going well?

09:19.826 --> 09:22.327
Not really, Chief.
She can't feather walk,

09:22.329 --> 09:24.763
and I gave her
three whole tries.

09:24.765 --> 09:29.000
Training is new to you,
just as being trained
is new to Sofia.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.069
Just take it easy.
Be patient.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.772
A little encouragement
from you might help.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.575
Encouragement... right.

09:39.513 --> 09:41.246
( straining )

09:41.248 --> 09:43.081
I can do this.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.116
Try to keep your eyes up.
It helps.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.718
Oh, thanks.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.520
And don't think
so much about it.

09:48.522 --> 09:50.455
It works best
if you just do it.

09:50.457 --> 09:53.191
Got it. Eyes up.
Don't think.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.298
Oh! That was very helpful.
Thank you.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.134
( gasps ) What's that?

10:03.136 --> 10:05.437
This little kitty is
the next part of your training.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.305
Your feather walking
is coming along,

10:07.307 --> 10:10.575
but you're also gonna have
to wrangle a magical creature

10:10.577 --> 10:13.878
to get your enchantlet.
What are you doing?

10:13.880 --> 10:16.081
Just saying hello.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.950
This is training,
not a petting zoo.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.120
Okay, but he doesn't
really need wrangling.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.256
That's because he's wearing
the calm collar I put on him.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.325
-Ready? This!
-For what?

10:29.296 --> 10:30.562
( growling )

10:35.235 --> 10:38.336
You have to get
the calm collar back on him!

10:38.338 --> 10:41.506
It's important to learn this!
It'll help you later! Here!

10:45.145 --> 10:46.344
Aah!

10:48.148 --> 10:50.081
( screaming )

10:50.083 --> 10:51.349
( yowls )

11:03.096 --> 11:06.197
Okay, the princess
has some moves!

11:06.199 --> 11:09.300
Whoa! Easy there, fellow!

11:09.302 --> 11:11.603
Hey, Princess,
you need some rescuing?

11:11.605 --> 11:13.204
No, I can do it...

11:13.206 --> 11:15.206
but I could use
a little more advice!

11:15.208 --> 11:16.941
Try not to get roasted!

11:16.943 --> 11:19.077
Not helping!

11:24.985 --> 11:27.252
( gasps ) Hey!
You like that?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.723
Come on! Come get it!

11:34.161 --> 11:35.794
-( growls )
-Sofia!

11:35.796 --> 11:37.362
Watch out!

11:37.364 --> 11:39.531
What are you doing?

11:39.533 --> 11:41.833
Didn't you see him
raise those paws?

11:41.835 --> 11:44.969
I was fine. He was
playing with the light
from my amulet, Chrysta.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.905
From where I was,
it looked like you were

11:46.907 --> 11:48.973
gonna get batted around
like a ball of yarn.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.409
Here, I'll show you.
Just let me--

11:51.411 --> 11:54.045
Wait, where is he?

11:54.047 --> 11:58.216
Great. Now I'll have to go
find him and bring him
back to the Isles.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.585
Sofia, I have no idea
how you're gonna

12:00.587 --> 12:03.054
get your enchantlet
at this rate.

12:03.056 --> 12:07.058
I might have a better chance
if you would really teach me
how to do things.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.327
Hey, I'm doing the best
I can, Princess.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.662
I'm not a royal tutor.

12:10.664 --> 12:12.397
Why do you say
things like that?

12:12.399 --> 12:14.699
It's like you
want me to fail.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.868
I'm trying to teach you
to think on your feet.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.404
Fine. Then that's
what I'll do.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.272
Oh!

12:21.274 --> 12:23.374
Well, you don't
give up easily.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.843
I'll give you that.

12:24.845 --> 12:25.910
Thank you.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.085
All right, Princess,
this is it.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.455
This is where all
the feather walking
and beast wrangling practice

12:37.457 --> 12:39.257
will help you get
your enchantlet.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.525
-You ready?
-What do I have to do?

12:40.527 --> 12:42.694
You just climb up
the Glimmering Glacier here,

12:42.696 --> 12:44.429
feather walk
across the deep snow,

12:44.431 --> 12:46.030
wrangle the ArctiCondors,

12:46.032 --> 12:47.966
and make it into that cave
to get your enchantlet.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.701
-ArctiCondors?
-Yep.

12:49.703 --> 12:53.438
Their job is to do everything
they can to keep you
out of that cave.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.640
-Here you go.
-Right. Okay.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.443
If, by some miracle,
you make it into that cave,

12:58.445 --> 13:01.613
your enchantlet
will choose you.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.415
Now, you better get moving.
The sun will be setting soon.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.718
If you get in trouble
and you want to give up,

13:06.720 --> 13:09.120
-don't feel bad, Princess.
-I won't give up.

13:09.122 --> 13:12.157
Okay, but the rules say
once you start climbing,

13:12.159 --> 13:14.225
I'm not allowed
to help you anymore.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.493
It's your test.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.128
That's okay.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.564
You haven't really helped me
that much so far.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.409
Get in trouble
and want to give up?

13:31.411 --> 13:33.411
I'll show her
what a princess can do!

13:38.151 --> 13:39.317
( gasps )

13:40.954 --> 13:43.588
-Wow. Aah!
-( roars )

13:43.590 --> 13:47.192
( sighs ) Is she
in trouble already?

13:50.664 --> 13:52.964
( wind gusting )

13:52.966 --> 13:56.234
Uhh... uhh, whoa!

13:57.537 --> 13:59.437
( gasps )

13:59.439 --> 14:02.140
( straining )

14:02.142 --> 14:04.209
( growling )

14:04.211 --> 14:05.376
( grunts )

14:05.378 --> 14:07.278
Oh!

14:07.280 --> 14:09.547
Why, hello,
little person.

14:09.549 --> 14:13.451
Hale, what are you doing?
Send her down this instant!

14:13.453 --> 14:15.820
But that would be rude.

14:15.822 --> 14:20.391
Rude? We're supposed
to stop them. It's our job!

14:20.393 --> 14:22.660
Lovely sunset, isn't it?

14:22.662 --> 14:26.130
Oh, she got you
with a calm collar,
didn't she?

14:27.567 --> 14:30.034
You know, Windy,
we never stop

14:30.036 --> 14:32.237
to enjoy
the sunset anymore.

14:32.239 --> 14:36.007
It's just lovely,
isn't it?

14:36.009 --> 14:39.210
Well, yes.
Hey, wait a minute.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.479
I hope she
didn't fall.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.482
( struggling )

14:52.592 --> 14:54.459
That's it!
You're doing it!

14:55.729 --> 14:58.563
I did it!
I feather walked!

14:58.565 --> 15:01.065
Hmm, not bad for a princess.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.104
Wow. Beautiful.

15:09.342 --> 15:13.111
Excuse me, miss!
Hello! Over here!

15:13.113 --> 15:14.579
Hi.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.715
I'm Stormy.
What's your name?

15:17.717 --> 15:20.518
I'm Sofia.
Why are we whispering?

15:20.520 --> 15:22.620
I don't want
the dragon to hear us.

15:22.622 --> 15:23.788
-Dragon?
-Yeah.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.290
I was following him,

15:25.292 --> 15:27.058
and then he saw me
and chased me

15:27.060 --> 15:28.860
and I got scared.

15:28.862 --> 15:31.062
Don't tell
my parents, Sofia.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.298
ArctiCondors are
supposed to be brave.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.365
Where is he?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.601
Over there.
Hear him growling?

15:36.603 --> 15:39.504
( snoring )

15:43.476 --> 15:45.276
It's not a dragon.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.879
It's a Baronga,
and it's not growling,

15:47.881 --> 15:49.213
it's sleeping.

15:49.215 --> 15:51.115
Now, let's get out of here.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.817
But I'm frightened.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.619
It's okay.
We'll just hurry up

15:54.621 --> 15:56.487
and leave before he
wakes up. Come on.

16:03.229 --> 16:05.930
There you are.
Hold on.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.999
Is that our Stormy?

16:08.001 --> 16:09.968
What are you doing
with him?

16:09.970 --> 16:11.970
Mom! She saved me!

16:11.972 --> 16:14.105
I went into the cave
after a dragon

16:14.107 --> 16:17.275
because, you know, they're
not supposed to be there!

16:17.277 --> 16:19.310
-But then it--
-Trapped him.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.579
Yeah, that's right!
I wasn't scared.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.614
I wasn't scared at all.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.918
But then it trapped me
and Sofia saved me.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.087
-( growls )
-Kinda did.

16:29.089 --> 16:32.523
Ah, all right.
I guess we owe you one.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.325
We won't drive you away.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.528
But first,
take that calm collar
off my husband!

16:37.530 --> 16:42.633
Aw, I'm so glad you didn't fall
off the glacier, nice Princess.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.369
Do you need a hug?

16:44.371 --> 16:46.270
And please hurry!

16:46.272 --> 16:48.106
Right. Sorry.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.511
Rawr! What's going on?!

16:53.513 --> 16:56.514
Who's this?
I'll get rid of her.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.616
It's all right.
It's all right, dear.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.551
The princess
saved our boy.

17:00.553 --> 17:03.788
Go on, get your enchantlet.
We'll call it even.

17:03.790 --> 17:07.692
Oh, there's still the--
Wah! Baronga!

17:14.034 --> 17:17.101
Whoa!

17:20.373 --> 17:22.807
Whoa!

17:22.809 --> 17:25.176
I gotta say, kid,
that was great!

17:25.178 --> 17:27.712
You got past the big birds,
saved the little one,

17:27.714 --> 17:30.581
even threw in
some feather walking
for good measure!

17:30.583 --> 17:32.683
Now, come on,
show me your enchantlet!

17:32.685 --> 17:35.686
-I didn't get it yet.
-You what?

17:35.688 --> 17:38.823
I was about to,
but then I saw
the little ArctiCondor,

17:38.825 --> 17:41.192
and I had to get him
away from the Baronga.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.994
I couldn't just
leave him there.

17:42.996 --> 17:45.496
But you were supposed to get
the enchantlet by sundown!

17:45.498 --> 17:48.266
The sun's not down yet.
I can still do it.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.568
The path to the cave
is buried in snow!

17:50.570 --> 17:53.371
Even feather walking,
you couldn't get there in time.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.574
So that's it?
I don't get to be a protector?

17:56.576 --> 17:59.377
-I'm afraid not.
-But I was so close.

17:59.379 --> 18:03.047
Look on the bright side.
You're still a princess.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.616
You can go back
to your tea parties

18:05.618 --> 18:07.752
and fancy dances and...

18:07.754 --> 18:09.353
Is that still
what you think,

18:09.355 --> 18:10.922
that I'm some
helpless girl?

18:10.924 --> 18:12.723
-Well, I--
-It's like you decided

18:12.725 --> 18:15.560
-you knew me
before you even met me!
-Listen, Sofia--

18:15.562 --> 18:17.895
Then you were so busy
saying I couldn't do it,

18:17.897 --> 18:20.064
you never took the time
to help me do it!

18:20.066 --> 18:22.133
-Well, that's--
-Did Orion train you?

18:22.135 --> 18:23.901
-Yes.
-I bet he encouraged you.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.037
I bet he showed you
how to do things,

18:26.039 --> 18:28.539
not just tell you
that you couldn't do them.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.442
That's--
that's true.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.644
Oh, maybe
you're right.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.813
I didn't give you
much of a chance,

18:35.815 --> 18:38.416
and I could've shown you
better how to do things.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.818
Turns out I'm not so good
at this training stuff.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.721
It was me who failed,
Sofia, not you.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.656
But where are you going?

18:45.658 --> 18:49.327
To wrangle that Baronga
and take him home.

18:52.065 --> 18:55.199
Oh, no!
Chrysta, wait!

18:56.302 --> 18:59.737
I have to get up there.
But how?

18:59.739 --> 19:03.107
Excuse me,
Mrs. ArctiCondor!

19:03.109 --> 19:04.509
I need your help!

19:04.511 --> 19:05.676
Down here!

19:08.148 --> 19:11.182
All right, big fella.
Time to put this collar on.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.851
Uh-oh. This just
got interesting.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.654
( growling )

19:18.424 --> 19:19.524
Uhh!

19:19.526 --> 19:20.491
Sofia!

19:21.828 --> 19:24.862
Hang on!
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

19:27.000 --> 19:28.499
Remember this?

19:36.609 --> 19:37.842
Gotcha.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.115
Wow, I'm
officially impressed!

19:44.117 --> 19:46.717
Did I just see you
riding an ArctiCondor?

19:46.719 --> 19:48.186
Yes, you did.

19:48.188 --> 19:51.889
Nice! Oh, Sofia,
the sun hasn't set yet!

19:51.891 --> 19:54.258
There's still time! Quick!

19:56.896 --> 19:58.563
Remember...

19:58.565 --> 20:00.798
It will pick me.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.976
But none of them
are choosing me!

20:11.978 --> 20:14.312
Well, it's not
just those.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.980
Look around you, Sofia.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.117
These are enchantlets, too!

20:42.275 --> 20:43.774
Amazing!

20:45.178 --> 20:47.612
I did it!
I got my enchantlet!

20:50.717 --> 20:52.583
You know, I gotta say,

20:52.585 --> 20:54.952
princesses are much tougher
than I thought.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.287
Tried to tell ya.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.589
Look, you did
great, Sofia,

20:58.591 --> 21:00.558
but there's a lot
more training to do.

21:00.560 --> 21:04.895
If you want, I can get Orion
to assign you another trainer.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.765
Well, you may not be
the best trainer,

21:07.767 --> 21:10.368
but you are
the best protector,

21:10.370 --> 21:12.903
so I guess I'm
lucky to have you.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.739
Let's give this
a try.

21:14.741 --> 21:15.773
Okay!

21:15.775 --> 21:17.775
But you could be
a little nicer.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.777
Noted. Hey, what do you say

21:19.779 --> 21:22.613
we get this Baronga
back where he belongs?

21:22.615 --> 21:25.049
-I'm glad he's a kitten.
-He's a kitten?

21:25.051 --> 21:27.184
They are a handful
when they're grown.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.622
The path is gone.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.924
I'm gonna have to figure
out another way down.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.159
Well, he might help.

21:35.161 --> 21:38.396
Okay, enchantlet lesson
number one--

21:38.398 --> 21:42.066
step over here,
then flick your wrist
to get it started.

21:43.770 --> 21:44.769
Amazing!

21:44.771 --> 21:45.770
Great!

21:45.772 --> 21:46.971
Now, flick faster

21:46.973 --> 21:48.439
as you go in a loop
to make a lasso.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.841
Like this?

21:50.843 --> 21:53.010
Close. Flick
a little faster,

21:53.012 --> 21:55.446
and loop! Come on,
you can do it!

21:55.448 --> 21:58.249
-Yeah, that's it!
-I did it!

21:58.251 --> 21:59.850
Now loop it
over his body,

22:01.287 --> 22:02.920

22:04.924 --> 22:07.425
Now you're looking
like a real protector!

22:07.427 --> 22:08.759
Climb on!

22:08.761 --> 22:10.828
And you're helping
like a real trainer!

22:10.830 --> 22:12.930
Let's go, boy!

22:12.932 --> 22:15.199
Whoo-hoo!

22:19.305 --> 22:22.473

a non-magical protector before.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.974
You're something
totally new.

22:23.976 --> 22:27.378
We should call you
Sofia the First!

22:27.380 --> 22:29.880
I like the sound
of that.
