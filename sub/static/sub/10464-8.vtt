00:17.976 --> 00:19.277
On this day,

00:19.602 --> 00:22.447
I consider myself the luckiest
man on the face of the Earth.

00:25.734 --> 00:26.794
Nice going, ace.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.953
You're getting married, not
retiring from baseball.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.749
"Kirsten, I... "

00:32.782 --> 00:33.916
What, sweetie?

00:37.370 --> 00:38.639
You having a tough time?

00:38.663 --> 00:40.548
No, not really.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.059
I've got some good ideas.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.010
I just want it to be...

00:48.965 --> 00:50.484
This is the most beautiful thing

00:50.508 --> 00:52.435
I have ever read
in my entire life.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.316
I asked her to take a look.
You know, check the grammar.

00:59.017 --> 00:59.952
You think?

00:59.976 --> 01:01.819
- Stop it!
- You guys?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.446
You've gotta read this.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.489
Read what?

01:09.069 --> 01:10.244
Wow.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.164
Why aren't you marrying me?

01:14.199 --> 01:15.092
If anyone

01:15.116 --> 01:17.877
ever said something
that romantic to me,

01:19.037 --> 01:20.421
I would just faint.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.509
Right on the ground. Boom. Gone.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.427
What is this?

01:26.836 --> 01:28.355
Absolutely not!

01:28.379 --> 01:29.565
You'll hear it
during the ceremony

01:29.589 --> 01:31.182
and not a minute before.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.527
Boy, Charlie,

01:33.551 --> 01:34.945
she really loves you.

01:34.969 --> 01:37.323
I mean, that part about...

01:37.347 --> 01:38.481
Don't.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.566
I'm going to start crying again.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.614
Where's that
collection of quotes?

01:48.066 --> 01:50.118
- I know we had one.
- It's downstairs.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.671
Come on, you can't come up with,

01:52.695 --> 01:53.964
like, a minute's worth
of wedding vows

01:53.988 --> 01:55.299
without cribbing
off of somebody?

01:55.323 --> 01:57.291
Would you just get me
the book and be quiet?

01:58.076 --> 01:59.252
Yes, sir.

01:59.661 --> 02:00.930
God, what's so hard about...

02:00.954 --> 02:02.713
"I love you. I wanna
be with you forever"?

02:07.919 --> 02:09.429
Yeah, what's so hard about it?

02:16.594 --> 02:19.824
<i>♪ Everybody wants to live ♪</i>

02:19.848 --> 02:21.566

02:46.583 --> 02:48.310
Are you bringing anybody
to the wedding?

02:48.334 --> 02:50.845
A date? No. Are you?

02:51.504 --> 02:54.233
No. Griffin never would
have come, anyway.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.017
He probably doesn't
even own a tie.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.811
Sarah's gonna look great.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.492
She's gonna walk in,
she's gonna look great,

03:03.516 --> 03:04.952
and she's gonna be with Will.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.954
It's bad enough I have to see
them here every stupid day.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.154
They're so...

03:08.229 --> 03:09.947
In the halls, by the lockers,

03:10.231 --> 03:11.407
in the cafeteria.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.242
In the parking lot.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.288
Justin, hi.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.915
I'm late for gym.

03:19.073 --> 03:20.050
Since when does that matter?

03:20.074 --> 03:21.959
Hey, listen, you know
what's Saturday?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.721
Sophie B. Hawkins concert.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.347
Remember, we bought
tickets three months ago.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.641
Those great seats. I
thought maybe we'd...

03:27.665 --> 03:28.799
What?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.134
Go together?

03:31.961 --> 03:32.980
What's the deal?

03:33.004 --> 03:35.274
He's out of the picture, so now
you're running back to me?

03:35.298 --> 03:37.693
We're supposed to go together
like nothing ever happened?

03:37.717 --> 03:39.018
No, no, that isn't...

03:41.763 --> 03:43.940
I was gonna ask you if
you wanted my ticket.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.401
Yeah, sure. What the hell?
You have it on you?

03:48.311 --> 03:50.664
- It's at home.
- Okay.

03:50.688 --> 03:53.533
Well, I'll pick it up
later or something.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.954
You're welcome.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.374
You remember the best birthday
party you've ever been to?

04:01.574 --> 04:03.594
With, like, a, uh...
I don't know,

04:03.618 --> 04:05.670
like a really great
clown or something?

04:05.828 --> 04:07.046
A clown?

04:08.289 --> 04:09.423
Got milk?

04:10.375 --> 04:12.353
That's good, that's good.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.437
Well, whatever.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.638
That's kind of what a
bachelor party's like.

04:16.630 --> 04:17.848
Only, uh...

04:18.716 --> 04:19.892
Only what?

04:20.760 --> 04:22.112
Only eight or nine more years,

04:22.136 --> 04:24.355
and we'll actually be able
to finish this conversation.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.108
No. No, of course I'm not mad.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.527
Just get back to bed, and
I'll check on you tomorrow.

04:29.644 --> 04:30.820
I love you too.

04:32.730 --> 04:33.990
Kirsten, what's the matter?

04:34.274 --> 04:35.700
Charlie cancel the
wedding on you?

04:36.985 --> 04:38.327
That was my sister.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.037
I can't...

04:41.489 --> 04:42.925
She has an ear infection.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.126
She can't get on a plane
at least until Sunday.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.336
So? She'll be here for
the wedding, right?

04:47.412 --> 04:48.629
But...

04:49.414 --> 04:52.059
See, we were supposed to spend the
night before my wedding together.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.979
You know, just spend
some time, bond,

04:55.003 --> 04:56.105
like we did before hers.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.638
It was gonna be this tradition.

04:58.798 --> 04:59.974
Sorry.

05:02.719 --> 05:03.894
Hold it.

05:04.679 --> 05:05.948
Hold it, what is this?

05:05.972 --> 05:07.315
The hangover brigade?

05:07.432 --> 05:09.150
Well, a good scout's
always prepared.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.570
Okay, scout. Raise
your right hand.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.405
- Why?
- Do it.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.209
Now,

05:17.233 --> 05:19.910
promise me, you're not
gonna get him drunk.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.121
You're not gonna
bring porno films.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.665
I don't need Charlie
comparing me to that.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.678
Oh, and you are not gonna
hire some stripper

05:27.702 --> 05:30.254
who wants to coax him into
one last sleazy hurrah.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.057
Oh, well, why don't
we just hold it

05:32.081 --> 05:33.350
at the public library?

05:33.374 --> 05:34.768
I'm not kidding, Dudley.

05:34.792 --> 05:38.554
Swear! On... your
grandmother's life.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.056
Not Nana.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.694
All right, okay. I promise.
I swear.

05:43.718 --> 05:44.894
Thank you.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.532
- Bailey.
- Hi.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.950
Just the person I wanted to see.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.734
- What's up?
- Little problem.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.412
Kirsten just made me promise

05:53.436 --> 05:55.706
that I wouldn't be responsible
for anything too "out there"

05:55.730 --> 05:56.874
at the party tomorrow night.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.126
Aw, man. Bummer, huh?

05:59.150 --> 06:00.576
Here's the interesting part...

06:01.903 --> 06:03.454
She didn't say
anything about you.

06:12.997 --> 06:14.507
Here, I found it.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.387
How much I owe you? Twenty-five?

06:19.879 --> 06:21.472
You don't have to pay me.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.558
I don't want you to pay me.
I'm giving it to you.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.644
Forget it.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.280
I don't wanna owe you anything.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.439
- What are you talking about?
You wouldn't. -Uh-uh.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.660
I'm not gonna let you buy
your way out of feeling bad.

06:33.684 --> 06:34.944
I'm not.

06:35.311 --> 06:38.531
Wh-what am I supposed to do?
I said I'm sorry.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.044
Justin, I'm just trying to make
things better between the two of us.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.661
I don't want things
to be better.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.122
'Cause you know what I figured
out these last couple of months?

06:46.656 --> 06:48.207
We don't need to be friends.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.251
I don't <i>need</i> you.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.388
Fine. If that's how
you're gonna be,

06:53.412 --> 06:54.640
then don't let me offend you

06:54.664 --> 06:56.340
by trying to do
something nice for you.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.175
I'll just go to the concert.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.521
Hey, wait a minute, I already
invited Robin Baratz!

07:00.545 --> 07:01.804
Yeah, well, tough!

07:02.964 --> 07:04.650
Guess once they schlep
in the folding chairs,

07:04.674 --> 07:05.850
it's official, huh?

07:08.970 --> 07:10.489
So I don't know if
Dud told you or not,

07:10.513 --> 07:13.524
but I'm in charge of this
bachelor party thing now.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.869
And all systems are go.

07:15.893 --> 07:18.195
I mean, it's gonna be wild.

07:19.188 --> 07:20.614
It's gonna be...

07:21.607 --> 07:23.033
Whew.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.045
And if you have any
special requests,

07:25.069 --> 07:26.755
you know, stripper-wise, then...

07:26.779 --> 07:28.038
Bay, um...

07:28.781 --> 07:32.970
I mean, would you hate me
if I asked you to bag this?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.336
This party?

07:36.080 --> 07:37.339
Bag it? How come?

07:38.875 --> 07:40.102
I don't know if I'm
gonna have time.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.802
I mean, I gotta pick up my tux.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.596
I've gotta go to
the travel agent.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.098
I've gotta finish
writing these vows.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.602
I mean, the truth is, I
gotta <i>start</i> writing them.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.729
And...

07:51.846 --> 07:54.366
And you don't think that the
sight of a half-naked woman

07:54.390 --> 07:57.193
dancing around a hotel
room wouldn't inspire you?

07:58.227 --> 08:00.321
It'd inspire me.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.573
Cheers.

08:04.692 --> 08:07.588
All right, so what part
are you stuck on here?

08:07.612 --> 08:10.247
It's the... It's the
"forever" thing?

08:11.532 --> 08:14.335
The "death do you part" part?

08:15.578 --> 08:18.724
Oh, wait a minute, I know.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.392
It's the "forsaking
all others" stuff.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.310
That's what's throwing you.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.551
No, it isn't.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.764
Oh, wow.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.027
I... I was just kidding.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.069
You're really sweating this.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.227
I am not.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.948
You shouldn't be.
You shouldn't be.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.148
I mean, it's Kirsten.

08:36.849 --> 08:37.993
You're not gonna do any better.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.620
- She's it, Char.
- I know that.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.289
- Well, then what's the problem?
- There is no problem.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.948
I'm fine. It's fine.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.075
Are you sure?

08:46.943 --> 08:49.421
'Cause I can go, I
can call the hotel

08:49.445 --> 08:50.464
and I can cancel it.

08:50.488 --> 08:51.632
Dud and the other
guys, they'll live.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.800
No, I wanna do it.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.001
Really, this is gonna be great.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.045
We're gonna do it.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.421
The party's on.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.975
Bay! Bailey!

09:11.592 --> 09:12.653
Yeah?

09:12.677 --> 09:13.894
It's for you.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.564
Something about
confirming a stripper.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.191
Oh, that's...

09:19.350 --> 09:20.953
We're getting the
house repainted.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.945
- But you knew that.
- Mm-hmm.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.572
Now I'll tell one.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.491
Hello.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.452
Yes, yes, it is.
Right, right, right.

09:30.820 --> 09:31.996
Excuse me.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.873
No, I'm still here.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.751
- Almost ready?
- Just about.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.629
She was so cute, offering
to fill in for Meg tonight.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.183
She booked massages for
us, rented movies...

09:43.207 --> 09:44.935
Oh, did you talk to
the photographer?

09:44.959 --> 09:47.020
- There was a message. - I asked
him to come half an hour early.

09:47.044 --> 09:49.179
- Did the florist ever call back?
- Not yet.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.233
- Make sure the machine's on.
- You going out already?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.975
I didn't think the
party was until later?

09:53.009 --> 09:54.903
Yeah, I'm going over early
to work on my vows.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.145
Oh, okay.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.646
Have fun tonight.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.701
And try to be home in time just
to get a little bit of sleep.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.192
- Gotcha.
- Okay.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.751
We're getting married
tomorrow, Charlie.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.285
Is that something or what?

11:27.061 --> 11:28.278
Excuse me.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.406
Excuse me!

11:31.732 --> 11:32.908
Sorry.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.258
I love this song.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.301
I hate it!

11:51.961 --> 11:53.345
Justin, this was our song.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.440
Exactly.

11:55.464 --> 11:56.598
Shh.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.523
You Bailey Salinger?

12:04.849 --> 12:06.608
Yeah. Yes.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.496
Oh, this isn't my beer.
This is my friend's.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.706
- I was just holding it...
- Relax, I'm Honey.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.032
The entertainment for
the bachelor party.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.076
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.255
Bailey, everything, uh...
Everything cool here?

12:18.279 --> 12:19.840
Yeah, everything's cool.
Everything's cool.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.258
This is... Honey.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.175
This is, uh...

12:22.199 --> 12:24.970
This is Dudley and
Neil and Leo and Greg.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.054
- Hey-hey.
- Hi, Honey.

12:26.078 --> 12:26.972
Hey.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.505
- Howdy.
- You're the stripper?

12:28.789 --> 12:31.133
I prefer
"sartorially-challenged."

12:32.585 --> 12:34.970
What does, uh,
"sartorially" mean?

12:36.297 --> 12:37.681
Naked.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.892
- What floor?
- Fourth.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.821
- So you got the tapes?
- Got 'em.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.355
- You got the booze.
- That's it?

12:45.556 --> 12:46.825
Nobody would sell to me.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.568
It's lucky I talked some guys at
Sip and Shop into buying this.

12:49.768 --> 12:51.653
Oh, jeez, how pathetic.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.039
So, officer.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.583
Are you gonna read me my rights?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.909
I'm hoping you can and
will hold it against me.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.204
Oh, like I've never
heard that one before.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.585
Uh-oh.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.228
What the...

13:15.252 --> 13:16.678
Yes...

13:17.254 --> 13:18.972
Oh, this has gotta be a joke.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.976
Very funny, Dudley!

13:24.428 --> 13:25.405
Dud, that you?

13:25.429 --> 13:26.364
Yeah!

13:26.388 --> 13:27.606
Oh, God.

13:27.723 --> 13:28.783
Oh, God.

13:28.807 --> 13:29.942
Yeah.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.119
It's my husband.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.456
I'd introduce you, but
I think he's busy.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.543
Aw, man, I'm...

13:48.869 --> 13:50.128
I'm sorry.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.141
We just got this new
answering machine.

13:53.165 --> 13:56.019
I... I guess he didn't know

13:56.043 --> 13:58.512
that if you pick up the
phone, it keeps taping.

14:00.839 --> 14:03.267
Oh, it's a hell of a way to
find out, don't you think?

14:06.303 --> 14:07.980
Oh, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.316
If I knock on that door...

14:14.520 --> 14:17.364
Do you want to, um... just talk?

14:17.856 --> 14:19.366
I mean, I'm just...
I'm right over here.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.722
Claudia, forget it. It
wasn't so terrible.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.725
Where's that heating pad?
Is it in here?

14:45.134 --> 14:48.478
I swear it said "Healing
Massages" in the Yellow Pages.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.031
I mean, how are you
supposed to know

14:50.055 --> 14:52.075
how to say, "Stop torturing
me" in Romanian?

14:52.099 --> 14:54.860
Believe me, I'm learning it
before I go back there again.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.873
Could you put the news on?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.583
I wanna hear what the weather's
gonna be like tomorrow.

14:59.607 --> 15:03.118
Uh... In a minute.
I-I like this song.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.370
Please, God, don't let it rain.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.048
Oh, I bet the pad's upstairs.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.832
- Wait, wait, wait!
- What?

15:09.033 --> 15:11.210
- What's going on?
- Shh. Listen.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.013
It's a little loud.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.848
<i>We have some requests
and dedications.</i>

15:14.872 --> 15:18.050
<i>The next song goes out to
Kirsten with love from Claudia.</i>

15:19.835 --> 15:21.553
- Claud!
- Surprise!

15:21.754 --> 15:24.097
That's so sweet. What song is...

15:27.760 --> 15:29.853
It's the wrong song,
you stupid jerk!

15:32.097 --> 15:33.533
Well, you're not too
sentimental, are you?

15:33.557 --> 15:35.493
Hey, I said play
something romantic.

15:35.517 --> 15:38.320
Oh, I know you did.
I'm sure you did.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.375
But it's funny, Claud.

15:42.399 --> 15:43.992
I mean, really, it is.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.577
Come here.

16:00.834 --> 16:03.271
Thank you very much. We're
gonna take a little break.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.222
We'll be back in a minute.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.577
- Ow! That was my foot!
- Sorry.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.486
- Are you?
- You know what?

16:20.062 --> 16:21.748
I'm gonna go find someone
else to sit with.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.959
Do you have to be this
mean to me all the time?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.451
You know, it's not like things
have been great for me, either.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.629
Oh, yeah, okay.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.130
Well, I would've
sent you a card,

16:29.154 --> 16:30.674
but Hallmark doesn't make one,

16:30.698 --> 16:32.416
"So your boyfriend's in prison."

16:33.617 --> 16:34.835
Justin?

16:35.119 --> 16:36.295
What?

16:36.495 --> 16:37.921
Isn't that your dad?

16:41.375 --> 16:42.634
What's he doin' here?

16:45.045 --> 16:46.388
Who's that woman?

16:50.050 --> 16:51.903
- Justin, maybe it isn't what you think.
- Son of a bitch.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.520
Yeah, well, what did
it look like to you?

16:53.637 --> 16:55.564
Did it look like a
business meeting?

16:55.597 --> 16:57.024
'Cause that's what
he told my mom.

16:57.057 --> 16:57.951
Wait. Don't go yet.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.027
No, no, no, I gotta get
out of here, okay?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.113
Open spaces.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.574
Wide open spaces.

17:05.941 --> 17:07.167
A big field.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.827
Uh-huh. All right, thanks.

17:09.444 --> 17:12.372
They're still working on it.
They said not to go anywhere.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.415
Everybody's a comedian, huh?

17:14.657 --> 17:17.252
Julia is at the hottest
show in San Francisco.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.588
Claud and Kirsten are
out getting massages.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.050
Will and Sarah are probably
giving each other massages.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.718
Was it something I said?

17:24.792 --> 17:25.854
You know, you'd probably be

17:25.877 --> 17:27.429
a lot more comfortable
without that jacket.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.567
Yeah, right, like I wanna
plummet to my death in pasties.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.184
Here. You need this
more than I do.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.899
Don't look at me. You hired her.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.661
Yeah, for the party
that never was.

17:41.685 --> 17:42.819
I mean, look at this!

17:42.895 --> 17:43.913
We're stuck here,

17:43.937 --> 17:46.958
and Charlie is sitting alone
in some empty hotel room,

17:46.982 --> 17:49.117
trying to find something
to watch on SpectraVision,

17:49.234 --> 17:50.577
bored out of his mind.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.382
It's that new woman
at his office.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.459
Every day, he comes home
and says how funny she is.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.513
Or it's the girl at
the dry cleaners.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.506
I know she always
flirts with him.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.728
What is the room number next door?
I'm gonna call.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.729
Monica, that's not a...

18:07.753 --> 18:10.055
No, I have to find
out who she is!

18:10.839 --> 18:12.140
What if I know her?

18:12.382 --> 18:14.559
What if she's someone
that I know?

18:15.552 --> 18:17.521
What if she's beautiful?

18:18.180 --> 18:22.734
I bet she probably is young
and beautiful and...

18:24.812 --> 18:26.321
He used to think...

18:27.981 --> 18:29.408
He used to...

18:32.694 --> 18:36.081
I could be attractive to a man.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.585
Maybe not at this second, but...

18:42.121 --> 18:46.633
Do you think someone
could find me...

18:48.502 --> 18:49.803
Yeah.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.346
Yeah, I do.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.352
I'm sorry.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.938
Am I keeping you from something?

18:59.972 --> 19:03.275
Nah. Just... this
bachelor party.

19:03.934 --> 19:04.953
It's supposed to be.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.820
I'm surprised everybody's
not here yet.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.906
Is it a good friend of yours
who's getting married?

19:12.651 --> 19:17.205
Yeah. Um... We're pretty close.

19:17.781 --> 19:18.999
Oh.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.376
Why?

19:21.827 --> 19:24.222
There's a bar in the lobby.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.547
Maybe...

19:28.375 --> 19:29.926
Can I buy you a drink?

19:32.504 --> 19:34.399
Sure. Yeah.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.891
I have time for that.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.367
- Finally.
- Jeez, Louise!

19:44.391 --> 19:46.276
We sure took the scenic route.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.955
Come on, I gotta pee
like a racehorse!

19:48.979 --> 19:51.114
Well, all the lights are
on, but nobody's home.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.294
Hey, I'm starving. Anybody
else for room service?

19:54.318 --> 19:55.962
It's weird he's not here.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.130
Where do you think he is?

19:57.154 --> 19:58.705
I don't know. Maybe
he's getting some air?

19:58.739 --> 20:00.457
Maybe he's out getting some.

20:00.657 --> 20:01.875
Ooh, beer me.

20:02.492 --> 20:05.513
Just let we have a large
pizza, extra anchovies. Good.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.755
No.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.341
No way.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.092
I'm trying.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.970
I'm trying, but it just
doesn't make any sense.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.649
What is he looking for up there,

20:16.673 --> 20:18.517
apart from the obvious?

20:19.593 --> 20:21.770
I don't know. Man,
I've never met him.

20:21.845 --> 20:24.523
Oh, come on. You're a guy.
Help me out.

20:27.559 --> 20:31.863
Maybe he's... scared to
be with one person.

20:32.689 --> 20:36.294
Maybe the idea of that,
for the rest of his life,

20:36.318 --> 20:39.079
I mean, that's... That's big.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.583
I swear I don't get that.

20:44.201 --> 20:47.295
Yeah, well, I don't get needing
75 pairs of shoes. I mean...

20:47.746 --> 20:49.631
Oh, yeah, right.

20:49.831 --> 20:51.508
They're exactly the same.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.230
What is wrong with waking up

20:55.254 --> 20:58.723
next to one person who you love
for the rest of your life?

20:59.758 --> 21:02.320
Is it like there's
some cosmic scorecard?

21:02.344 --> 21:04.896
He who's racked up the
most before he dies wins?

21:06.056 --> 21:07.450
I don't know.

21:07.474 --> 21:08.650
Oh.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.860
Well...

21:12.854 --> 21:14.739
How many women have
you slept with?

21:15.232 --> 21:16.251
Excuse me?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.753
I'm sorry. Listen to me.

21:18.777 --> 21:22.205
I mean, we've only known each
other for, what, 20 minutes?

21:22.531 --> 21:23.790
Thirty.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.375
Minutes or women?

21:25.617 --> 21:28.920
Um, both, actually,
more or less.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.007
Thirty.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.385
Do you even remember
all their names?

21:36.837 --> 21:39.347
I'm not 100-percent sure I
knew them all to start with.

21:40.465 --> 21:41.641
Uh!

21:41.675 --> 21:42.892
You asked.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.102
Okay.

21:44.678 --> 21:45.895
Okay, but...

21:47.306 --> 21:49.399
But if you were to
meet the right woman,

21:50.017 --> 21:53.236
the perfect, right,
wonderful woman,

21:53.603 --> 21:55.864
you could give all
that up, couldn't you?

21:57.190 --> 21:58.209
I guess I'd have to.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.659
Yeah, well,

22:00.736 --> 22:02.495
not according to my husband.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.759
Hey, you know that
friend of yours,

22:06.783 --> 22:08.209
the one who's getting married?

22:10.162 --> 22:11.588
What about him?

22:12.372 --> 22:14.132
Tell him he better mean it.

22:14.958 --> 22:17.854
Tell him, if he's gonna stand
up in front of God and everyone

22:17.878 --> 22:20.055
and promise to love
some woman forever,

22:21.590 --> 22:22.692
he better make sure

22:22.716 --> 22:24.809
he's got all that other
crap out of his system.

22:25.927 --> 22:27.520
Tell him I said so.

22:31.767 --> 22:34.620
So, what's our feature
presentation for tonight,

22:34.644 --> 22:36.112
Ms. Salinger?

22:36.605 --> 22:38.448
It's <i>An Affair to Remember.</i>

22:38.690 --> 22:39.667
Ah!

22:39.691 --> 22:40.960
Excellent choice.

22:40.984 --> 22:42.285
I never heard of it.

22:42.819 --> 22:45.121
But at the place, they
said it was good.

22:50.994 --> 22:52.253
Okay.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.720
Claudia, where did
this tape come from?

23:02.255 --> 23:04.057
From the video store.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.063
What is that?

23:14.184 --> 23:15.443
You don't wanna know.

23:17.145 --> 23:18.571
I can't believe this.

23:18.897 --> 23:22.158
I bet whoever got our movie is
saying exactly the same thing.

23:22.275 --> 23:24.077
I ruined everything.

23:24.152 --> 23:26.923
This was supposed to be
your great, special night,

23:26.947 --> 23:29.499
and every stupid thing
I did, it just...

23:31.326 --> 23:32.762
What's the use of making plans

23:32.786 --> 23:34.671
if they're all just
gonna get messed up?

23:34.955 --> 23:36.131
Hey, sweetie.

23:36.164 --> 23:38.341
Sometimes the best
things happen that way.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.759
Yeah, right.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.262
Like how I ended up here.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.931
I had five interviews that day.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.225
And I could've gone
to any one of them,

23:47.509 --> 23:49.102
except my car wouldn't start.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.490
I got a job, I met all you guys,

23:52.514 --> 23:53.648
and I fell in love.

23:57.727 --> 23:59.038
I'm getting married tomorrow

23:59.062 --> 24:01.990
because this was the one
interview that I could walk to.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.302
Hey.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.013
What, are you
following me around?

24:25.463 --> 24:26.931
No.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.894
Stupid bar up the street
wouldn't let me in.

24:31.344 --> 24:32.604
Good.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.691
So, what are you gonna...

24:36.933 --> 24:38.276
Um...

24:38.935 --> 24:40.445
Are you gonna say
something to him?

24:41.104 --> 24:42.489
I don't know.

24:42.772 --> 24:45.543
I don't... I don't want
any crummy excuses

24:45.567 --> 24:47.702
or lies or...

24:50.488 --> 24:51.956
No.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.751
I'm not doing this. I'm
not doing this with you.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.836
Justin, you should
talk about it.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.464
- Talk to me.
- About screwing around?

24:59.956 --> 25:02.185
Why don't you go have that
conversation with him.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.843
You guys have that in common.

25:06.254 --> 25:09.766
Can't you stop being angry
for, like, five minutes?

25:10.800 --> 25:11.819
I wanna help you.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.062
- Give me a break, okay?
- I do.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.617
Look, just forget about the
last few months, okay?

25:17.641 --> 25:19.285
I mean, you and I, we
have always been...

25:19.309 --> 25:21.027
I mean, when my parents...

25:26.399 --> 25:28.034
You were the first one I called.

25:30.487 --> 25:31.829
I know that.

25:36.576 --> 25:39.379
Listen, I'm here, and
I care about you.

25:41.164 --> 25:43.508
And you shouldn't have
to deal with this alone.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.847
Justin, who else are you
gonna talk to about this?

25:55.679 --> 25:56.980
Come on.

25:59.432 --> 26:00.775
No.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.037
I can't.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.195
Uh...

26:04.813 --> 26:06.072
you and me,

26:06.523 --> 26:07.991
we're not friends.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.201
We're not anything.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.247
About six feet,

26:14.447 --> 26:16.175
uh, long, dark hair,

26:16.199 --> 26:18.209
kind of scruffy-beard
thing going on.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.128
With a woman, maybe.

26:21.204 --> 26:22.338
Okay, thanks.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.427
We should charge
this to his room.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.095
That'd show him.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.598
It's on me.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.057
No. I kept you from that party.

26:33.466 --> 26:34.809
I want to.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.645
I don't want you thinking that
all men are pigs or anything.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.524
I knew I met you for a reason.

27:00.201 --> 27:01.419
Hi.

27:02.203 --> 27:04.839
I... I don't wanna go home yet.

27:05.373 --> 27:07.508
He's probably back there by now.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.136
He's probably
wondering where I am.

27:11.629 --> 27:12.805
Good.

27:14.132 --> 27:18.019
Oh, I think I'm gonna
get a room and crash.

27:19.179 --> 27:22.023
I'll be Scarlett O'Hara and
worry about it tomorrow.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.275
I think that's a
very decent plan.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.491
Just now?

27:32.108 --> 27:33.743
Okay, thanks. Thanks a lot.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.457
So, Charlie,

27:39.949 --> 27:41.501
we're friends now, right?

27:42.535 --> 27:44.253
Sure. You bet.

27:44.704 --> 27:48.341
Then, maybe you won't mind
if I ask you a small favor?

27:51.961 --> 27:53.179
Would you...

27:53.838 --> 27:55.139
sleep with me?

27:56.341 --> 27:57.517
What?

27:58.802 --> 28:01.697
A, I think you're really cute.

28:01.721 --> 28:05.951
And two, I think what I
need to do right now

28:05.975 --> 28:07.870
is to even the score,

28:07.894 --> 28:09.737
to level the playing field.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.957
I mean, isn't there
that expression,

28:11.981 --> 28:13.825
"turn about is foreplay"?

28:14.067 --> 28:15.493
I think it's "fair play."

28:16.528 --> 28:17.829
Whatever.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.834
Am I signing in the right place?

28:53.148 --> 28:54.166
<i>- Going down?</i>
<i>- No, I'm not.</i>

28:54.190 --> 28:56.293
<i>- What time have you?</i>
<i>- Ten after five.</i>

28:56.317 --> 28:57.294
<i>Oh, great.</i>

28:57.318 --> 28:59.672
Oh, no. Oh, no!

28:59.696 --> 29:01.205
He thinks she's not coming.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.175
She got hit by a car!
That's why she's not there?

29:03.199 --> 29:06.002
How can he not hear the siren?
It's her ambulance.

29:06.202 --> 29:07.587
I can't take this.

29:09.914 --> 29:11.674
So are you in, or are you out?

29:11.958 --> 29:13.217
Call. What do you got?

29:13.501 --> 29:15.938
Um, two pair.

29:15.962 --> 29:16.981
Ha!

29:17.005 --> 29:18.848
The house is full!

29:19.007 --> 29:20.516
But not that full.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.268
Straight flush!

29:29.851 --> 29:31.319
Wait, maybe that's, uh...

29:31.519 --> 29:32.862
Oh. Still not him.

29:32.896 --> 29:33.873
Can I talk to you for a second?

29:33.897 --> 29:35.406
Excuse me. You kids go ahead.

29:35.690 --> 29:38.534
I saw them. I saw them
getting a room together.

29:39.986 --> 29:42.131
I guess Charlie decided
not to go so gently

29:42.155 --> 29:43.424
into the good night after all.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.624
What?

29:45.200 --> 29:47.085
Do you think this is funny?

29:47.202 --> 29:48.419
No. I just...

29:50.038 --> 29:51.506
No, no, I don't.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.549
Well, who is she?

29:53.917 --> 29:56.344
Do you think it's
somebody that he knew?

29:56.669 --> 29:58.564
Somebody that he met
down in the bar?

29:58.588 --> 30:00.065
Somebody that he...
That he picked up

30:00.089 --> 30:02.526
in the, in the gift
shop buying magazines?

30:02.550 --> 30:04.153
I can't even begin to guess.

30:04.177 --> 30:05.561
You know, I did this.

30:06.513 --> 30:08.064
I dragged him here.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.159
There was something
going on with him.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.036
I knew that, and he was
trying to tell me,

30:12.060 --> 30:15.113
but no, I have to throw
him a party in a hotel

30:15.188 --> 30:17.249
with women and beds.

30:17.273 --> 30:18.834
I just... I walked him
right into this.

30:18.858 --> 30:20.127
Bailey, listen to me.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.327
You didn't anything.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.422
Your brother's an adult.
He did this.

30:23.446 --> 30:24.747
Yeah, well...

30:25.824 --> 30:28.209
He expects me to stand
up for him tomorrow,

30:29.035 --> 30:31.472
be his best man and
make some toast

30:31.496 --> 30:33.339
congratulating the happy couple?

30:34.707 --> 30:36.008
Well, forget it.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.262
Forget it. I won't.

30:50.473 --> 30:52.733
You're nervous.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.279
That's sweet.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.032
I am a little too.

31:02.068 --> 31:06.122
You'll be the first
one in a long time,

31:06.698 --> 31:08.499
other than what's-his-name.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.336
Other than Stuart.

31:22.422 --> 31:23.931
Monica, no.

31:24.507 --> 31:27.810
No, it's all right. I want to.

31:29.053 --> 31:30.605
Only because...

31:31.556 --> 31:32.700
you're drunk

31:32.724 --> 31:34.952
and you're hurt and pissed off.

31:34.976 --> 31:36.277
Oh, come on.

31:36.477 --> 31:39.123
You don't even have to remember
my name tomorrow. How's that?

31:39.147 --> 31:42.825
Look, I'm sorry,
but we're not...

31:45.695 --> 31:47.038
Why?

31:47.488 --> 31:51.218
I'm not good enough to be
number 31 on the Charlie list?

31:51.242 --> 31:52.668
Are you kidding?

31:53.369 --> 31:55.931
A year and a half ago,
me and you in a hotel,

31:55.955 --> 31:59.133
it's all I would have
been thinking about.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.260
But...

32:01.544 --> 32:02.803
But...

32:03.880 --> 32:06.390
I've kind of been using you,

32:07.133 --> 32:09.310
you know, to figure
something out.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.980
Well, I've been using
you, too, so we're even.

32:17.143 --> 32:18.736
I'm in love with someone.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.615
Kirsten.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.910
Her name's Kirsten, and...

32:25.985 --> 32:27.838
I don't know why I
didn't say anything.

32:27.862 --> 32:29.247
I should have.

32:32.283 --> 32:33.677
And, you know, before,

32:33.701 --> 32:36.712
when you asked me if I
could give up other women,

32:39.832 --> 32:40.851
the truth of it is,

32:40.875 --> 32:44.136
I didn't know the answer
to that until just now.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.100
But, it's yes.

32:50.677 --> 32:53.062
No matter how beautiful
and how tempting,

32:54.555 --> 32:56.107
the answer is yes.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.214
Did I wake you up?

33:22.208 --> 33:23.426
It's okay.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.304
All right.

33:27.255 --> 33:28.472
Here's the deal.

33:28.631 --> 33:32.727
This... This does not mean
that we're friends, okay?

33:34.053 --> 33:35.271
I mean, uh...

33:35.388 --> 33:37.940
tomorrow we're...

33:38.141 --> 33:39.400
We're still...

33:46.524 --> 33:47.992
I need you right now.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.832
Okay?

34:02.290 --> 34:05.551
So I was going to tell her,

34:06.294 --> 34:07.970
my mother, uh...

34:09.255 --> 34:12.016
I got home, and she was up.

34:14.092 --> 34:16.312
She's... She's sewing.

34:18.931 --> 34:23.194
I mean, it's something that
she just does late at night.

34:23.686 --> 34:25.612
Who knows why, but, uh...

34:27.940 --> 34:30.502
And his car's there,
in the driveway.

34:30.525 --> 34:31.962
He's, uh, he's home already.

34:31.985 --> 34:34.830
He's home. He's, uh, asleep.

34:37.033 --> 34:41.847
I mean, he goes out
with this, this whore,

34:41.871 --> 34:44.340
and then he comes home, and
he sleeps in their bed.

34:48.710 --> 34:50.012
I gotta tell her.

34:51.380 --> 34:52.723
I don't...

34:54.509 --> 34:56.060
I don't think you should.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.230
Her husband is, is
cheating on her.

34:59.889 --> 35:00.949
This is something...

35:00.973 --> 35:02.284
She needs to know this!

35:02.308 --> 35:03.484
Yeah.

35:05.103 --> 35:08.197
But maybe what's
gonna happen is,

35:08.815 --> 35:11.409
your dad's gonna realize who
he's supposed to be with.

35:12.401 --> 35:15.037
That it was dumb to go
out looking for someone

35:15.488 --> 35:18.258
different, or better,
or more exciting,

35:18.282 --> 35:20.376
or whatever he thinks.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.754
Maybe he's gonna
figure that out.

35:24.831 --> 35:27.633
That he was with the
right person all along

35:28.126 --> 35:29.552
to begin with.

35:32.922 --> 35:34.691
And that trying to
be with someone else

35:34.715 --> 35:37.393
was just a big mistake.

35:42.431 --> 35:43.607
Is that...

35:44.809 --> 35:46.235
what happened with you?

35:48.938 --> 35:50.197
With us?

35:57.572 --> 35:59.081
I don't know.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.784
Looks like I missed a
pretty good party.

36:36.444 --> 36:37.786
Yeah.

36:37.987 --> 36:39.788
There were some real highlights.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.707
Let's see, uh...

36:42.950 --> 36:46.086
We got stuck in the elevator
for who knows how long.

36:46.579 --> 36:49.057
The stripper never actually
took her clothes off.

36:49.081 --> 36:50.466
I brought the wrong videos.

36:51.125 --> 36:52.644
And, and, oh!

36:52.668 --> 36:53.645
Oh, yeah!

36:53.669 --> 36:56.481
I saw you go into a hotel
room with a woman,

36:56.505 --> 36:58.233
who, what do you know,

36:58.257 --> 37:00.309
isn't the one you're
marrying in ten hours.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.312
- You saw us?
- Yeah.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.440
When you didn't show up,
I went looking for you.

37:09.894 --> 37:13.280
The woman, um, Monica,

37:13.981 --> 37:16.992
caught her husband
cheating on her

37:17.568 --> 37:19.119
in there, next door.

37:19.570 --> 37:23.666
And, uh, I found her in the
hallway falling apart,

37:24.242 --> 37:27.795
and you guys were
God knows where,

37:28.704 --> 37:30.673
and she asked me to
keep her company.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.769
So we went, and we had a
drink, and we talked.

37:33.793 --> 37:34.969
Right.

37:35.753 --> 37:38.222
Come on, Charlie. I'm
not an idiot, okay?

37:38.464 --> 37:40.140
I saw how you were yesterday.

37:40.549 --> 37:42.110
I saw you freaking
out about your vows,

37:42.134 --> 37:44.112
all that "forsaking
all others" stuff.

37:44.136 --> 37:46.031
You went to a room with her.
You didn't just talk.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.690
We just talked.

37:47.765 --> 37:50.651
And yeah, something could've
happened pretty easily.

37:51.018 --> 37:53.038
I mean, she wanted
something to happen,

37:53.062 --> 37:55.948
but I didn't.

37:58.609 --> 38:01.453
I have Kirsten, and I
don't want anyone else.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.748
End of story.

38:21.465 --> 38:22.933
You finish writing your vows?

38:24.969 --> 38:26.604
I can't come up with anything.

38:27.763 --> 38:29.023
Well, you just did.

38:31.225 --> 38:32.735
Really. What you just said.

38:33.644 --> 38:35.112
That pretty much covers it.

38:37.648 --> 38:38.824
Okay.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.160
Thanks.

38:48.951 --> 38:50.461
Look at you. You're this...

38:50.953 --> 38:52.379
This grownup.

38:53.539 --> 38:54.882
This man.

38:56.292 --> 38:57.968
This married man.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.265
I wish they were here
to see you like this.

39:05.968 --> 39:07.436
Or maybe they know.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.648
I hope they know.

39:16.771 --> 39:18.072
Claud?

39:27.948 --> 39:29.333
Wow!

39:29.992 --> 39:32.878
I couldn't sleep, so I figured
I'd do a little dress rehearsal.

39:37.833 --> 39:39.259
What do you think?

39:47.051 --> 39:48.310
Wow.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.437
Kirsten...

39:51.180 --> 39:52.491
There's this piece I play.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.734
It's the andante from
<i>Mendelssohn's Fourth.</i>

39:56.435 --> 39:58.320
It's the prettiest music I know.

40:00.856 --> 40:02.366
That's what you look like.

40:18.290 --> 40:19.309
Charlie.

40:19.333 --> 40:20.592
Oh, hey, George.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.063
I didn't mean to scare you.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.139
I just wasn't expecting
you, that's all.

40:25.548 --> 40:26.566
Yeah.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.194
Just needed to be some
place quiet for a while,

40:29.218 --> 40:30.477
clear my head.

40:32.471 --> 40:33.897
Waxing the floor?

40:34.890 --> 40:36.150
Uh-huh.

40:37.226 --> 40:38.527
Shiny.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.488
Thank you.

40:42.064 --> 40:43.490
You wanna take a little break?

40:44.692 --> 40:46.368
Have a cup of
coffee, sit awhile?

40:47.820 --> 40:49.288
Come on over.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.583
You're the boss.

40:53.534 --> 40:54.835
Yeah.

40:56.454 --> 40:57.838
I'm the boss.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.635
I'm the boss and...

41:06.839 --> 41:08.265
kind of the dad.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.977
Couple hours from now, I'm
gonna be the husband.

41:14.430 --> 41:16.648
If I had a clue how to be even
one of those, I'd be happy.

41:19.977 --> 41:21.779
There was this woman tonight.

41:22.521 --> 41:24.156
Last night, whenever it was,

41:25.941 --> 41:27.743
and she wanted me to
go to bed with her.

41:29.153 --> 41:32.956
And she was pretty and needy.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.793
Always a good combination,
right, George?

41:38.579 --> 41:40.422
It felt like this
test, you know?

41:41.790 --> 41:44.301
The snake offering the
apple, that kind of thing.

41:45.336 --> 41:46.970
And I said no.

41:48.088 --> 41:50.140
So if it was a
test, I passed it.

41:50.716 --> 41:53.227
Which means that I ought to be
feeling pretty good about now.

41:54.303 --> 41:57.147
So, just let me ask
you a question.

41:58.349 --> 42:01.443
How come I still feel like I
wanna run away some place?

42:02.102 --> 42:04.655
How come I-I feel
like I can't breathe?

42:05.689 --> 42:08.710
How come it feels like somebody's
got their fist around my lungs,

42:08.734 --> 42:09.952
and they're just...

42:13.989 --> 42:15.457
I don't know.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.128
Yeah.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.506
I don't know, either.

42:24.750 --> 42:26.260
I don't know, either.

42:30.589 --> 42:32.651
You got a quarter? Nickel?

42:32.675 --> 42:33.851
Anything?

42:41.058 --> 42:42.234
Thanks.

42:43.602 --> 42:44.579
Okay, this is it.

42:44.603 --> 42:46.405
Heads, I, I get married.

42:47.690 --> 42:48.866
Tails...

42:50.025 --> 42:51.243
Tails, I...

42:57.283 --> 43:00.419
Huh. How about that?

43:05.624 --> 43:07.092
Best two out of three.

43:08.305 --> 43:14.616
