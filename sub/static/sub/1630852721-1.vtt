00:01.202 --> 00:05.671
(heavy breathing)

00:13.247 --> 00:18.217
(Leila shrieks)

00:18.252 --> 00:18.684
- Open this door!

00:18.719 --> 00:20.319
Open this door!

00:28.262 --> 00:44.209
(calming music)

01:12.606 --> 01:16.708
(Leila groans)

01:16.811 --> 01:19.611
(sigh)

01:30.825 --> 01:34.660
(egg cracks)

01:34.695 --> 01:50.642
(alarm rings)

01:51.312 --> 01:54.746
(Ian grunts)

01:54.849 --> 02:00.586
- One, two, three,
four, five, six.

02:19.006 --> 02:21.540
(safe beeps)

02:35.823 --> 02:44.463
(calming music)

02:44.498 --> 02:46.331
- Good morning, Dad.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.833
- [Dad] Ian! Good
morning, superstar.

02:47.868 --> 02:52.104
Have a great day today. And
remember to have lots of fun.

02:52.206 --> 02:52.771
Okay?

02:52.873 --> 02:54.907
I love you, buddy.

02:55.009 --> 02:57.676
- Me too, Dad.

02:57.711 --> 02:58.911
One, two...

02:59.013 --> 03:01.346
Turn on faucet.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.347
(sink runs)

03:02.383 --> 03:04.316
Three, four...

03:04.351 --> 03:05.184
Five, six...

03:05.219 --> 03:07.186
One, two...

03:07.221 --> 03:09.288
Three, four...

03:09.390 --> 03:09.755
Five, six.

03:09.890 --> 03:10.789
One, two...

03:10.891 --> 03:13.492
Three, four...
(sink runs)

03:13.527 --> 03:17.429
Five, six.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.831
(Ian gargles)

03:19.867 --> 03:24.303
(Ian grunts)

03:24.338 --> 03:32.844
(door creaks)
(calming music)

03:32.880 --> 03:34.880
- Ian?

03:34.915 --> 03:36.915
Breakfast!

03:36.951 --> 03:52.898
(calming music)

03:59.607 --> 04:07.246
(objects clanging)

04:33.274 --> 04:34.072
- Hi, honey.

04:34.108 --> 04:35.974
- Good morning, Mom.

04:36.010 --> 04:36.908
- Hi.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.278
Did you take a bath
and wash your feet?

04:39.313 --> 04:41.580
- Yes, I washed my feet.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.081
- Did you find your screwdriver?

04:43.117 --> 04:43.949
- Yup. It was the safe space.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.451
- Ugh.
- Man, it's freezing in here.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.419
- I know!

04:47.454 --> 04:49.955
I think this thing is broken.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.890
- [Ian] Did you know that polar
bears have translucent fur?

04:51.925 --> 04:53.725
- Is that right?

04:53.827 --> 04:54.826
- Yeah.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.896
And they have black skin
to absorb the sun rays,

04:57.998 --> 05:00.732
which is why they don't feel
cold, even in the Arctic.

05:00.834 --> 05:04.536
They do actually struggle
with overheating though.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.472
- Well, I kinda wish I was
a polar bear right now.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.075
- I could try the
heater on the smart app.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.710
- Oh.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.979
Aren't you a smarty pants.

05:14.014 --> 05:18.984
- Dad and I set it up.

05:19.019 --> 05:22.354
- Yeah.

05:22.389 --> 05:23.755
How'd you sleep?

05:23.791 --> 05:25.457
- Fine,-I guess.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.959
Thank you.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.061
- Alright.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.962
Finish your breakfast,

05:30.998 --> 05:33.665
and then you could help
me clean up this place.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.301
Look, I want the yoga
mats rolled up tight,

05:36.337 --> 05:37.469
and then put away.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.104
And then I want the boxes
broken down and taken outside

05:39.206 --> 05:41.440
before the end of the day.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.974
Okay?

05:43.010 --> 05:45.310
- Wait.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.712
It's not working.

05:46.747 --> 05:47.913
- Yeah. It's not your app.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.147
It's probably the heater.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.950
Now, I know that we have some
space heaters around here

05:52.052 --> 05:55.954
that we could plug while the
handyman is getting here.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.824
Oh, here.

05:58.859 --> 05:59.958
Okay, great.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.994
He can work on the heater,
the door, the circuit box.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.896
- Wait.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.431
Someone's coming?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.333
- Yes. But you don't
even have to see him.

06:08.369 --> 06:11.303
You're gonna be working in the
living room on your report.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.071
- Come on. But it's Saturday.

06:13.107 --> 06:16.808
- Study time is Saturday.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.978
And the report is due on Monday.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.514
What's the matter?

06:22.549 --> 06:23.849
- Nothing.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.586
Can I use my camera?

06:27.621 --> 06:29.488
- Okay. But only
for a little bit.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.790
And I'm gonna go straighten
up the safe space

06:31.892 --> 06:33.725
and then we're gonna
work on the report.

06:33.761 --> 06:34.059
Got it?

06:34.261 --> 06:35.127
- Okay.

06:35.229 --> 06:38.730
- Hey.

06:38.766 --> 06:44.703
You got this.

06:44.738 --> 06:56.581
(footsteps tapping)

06:56.617 --> 06:59.384
- Wow. So I see the house
finally became a home.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.819
- Hi. Yes.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.187
We just moved in.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.388
- Oh, welcome.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.856
I am Neil Hargrove.

07:04.958 --> 07:05.924
I live in the neighborhood.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.859
- Hi, Neil.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.694
Wow. Home repair services.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.163
Wow, I could've used
you an hour ago.

07:11.265 --> 07:11.830
- Oh.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.098
Oh, no. Keep it, keep it.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.833
You know, your house has
been empty for a long time.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.536
I'm sure it could
use some upkeep.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.804
- Yeah.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.772
My husband and son thought
they could fix the whole thing

07:20.808 --> 07:21.940
with their bare hands.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.443
But we'll get it done.

07:24.478 --> 07:27.112
- Well, I'm here if
you need any help.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.947
- Thank you.

07:28.982 --> 07:29.281
- Don't hesitate to call.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.916
- Okay.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.617
It's nice to see a friendly
face in the neighborhood.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.887
- Oh, well, thank you.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.323
- Leila.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.892
My name is Leila.

07:40.994 --> 07:41.460
- That's a beautiful name.

07:41.495 --> 07:50.235
- Well, thank you.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.903
Oh, my goodness...

07:51.939 --> 07:53.805
Ian!

07:53.841 --> 07:59.110
(eerie music)

07:59.146 --> 08:07.219
Such a mess.

08:07.321 --> 08:16.962
Ow.

08:16.997 --> 08:32.944
Okay.

08:34.248 --> 08:37.148
Okay.

08:37.184 --> 08:42.521
Honey?

08:42.556 --> 08:44.856
(door slams)

08:44.892 --> 08:45.857
Ian, can you please
do something-

08:45.893 --> 08:46.658
- Look, Mom.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.693
It's a 2021 Model X.

08:48.729 --> 08:52.497
It has 752 net horsepower
and it's all electric.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.833
I want one for my birthday.

08:54.868 --> 08:55.667
- I bet.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.969
- And it's safer
than dad's car was.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.672
It has eight surround cameras,
12 ultrasonic sensors,

09:00.707 --> 09:02.741
and a forward facing radar.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.377
- Can you please do something
about the safe space?

09:05.412 --> 09:07.512
There are loose wires
and gadgets everywhere,

09:07.548 --> 09:08.547
all over the floor.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.981
That is supposed
to be your hangout.

09:10.083 --> 09:10.916
I'm afraid that some switch

09:10.951 --> 09:12.851
is gonna electrocute
you or something.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.553
- You're not listening to me.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.154
- No, I'm not listening
because that car

09:16.256 --> 09:19.224
took your father away from us.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.193
- It was a rare malfunction of
the autopilot driving system.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.995
- I know.

09:24.097 --> 09:24.996
A one in a 2 million chance.

09:25.098 --> 09:28.233
- Yes, exactly. One
in 2 million chance.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.835
The autonomous mode failed
to recognize the divider

09:30.938 --> 09:35.407
and categorized it as a
painted pavement marker.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.709
- I see so much of him in you.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.611
- Black with 22 inch wheels.

09:39.646 --> 09:40.412
- Yep.

09:40.581 --> 09:45.016
- Your smile, your
love of gadgets.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.651
- Here comes the
booby trap story.

09:46.753 --> 09:50.689
- Yes, here comes the
booby trap stories.

09:50.791 --> 09:54.859
So once when we were dating,

09:54.962 --> 09:58.496
I got home from work and I
turned on the light switch.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.198
And it set off about a-

10:00.300 --> 10:02.934
- A thousand rows of dominoes.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.235
I know.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.906
- And I was so mad.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.374
I wanted to punch him.

10:09.476 --> 10:14.913
But at the end of the
row was a tiny little box

10:14.948 --> 10:19.284
with a diamond ring in it.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.586
That's how he proposed.

10:21.688 --> 10:27.025
It was the bes

10:27.060 --> 10:28.760
- Yeah, but now
everything's different.

10:28.862 --> 10:29.794
- Yeah.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.896
I know.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.132
Hey.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.869
It's okay.

10:37.904 --> 10:41.272
Hey, let's count together.

10:41.375 --> 10:44.376
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.710
There you go.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.512
- 1, 2, 3, 4-

10:47.547 --> 10:49.581
- 5, 6.
- 5, 6.

10:49.683 --> 10:50.915
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

10:51.018 --> 10:59.124
- Good. Breathe.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.493
Better?

11:01.528 --> 11:04.829
- I just wish he was here.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.164
- I miss him too.

11:06.199 --> 11:09.467
But it's you and me now.

11:09.503 --> 11:12.003
We're a team.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.172
- Okay.
- Okay?

11:14.207 --> 11:15.940
I'm gonna go downstairs
and take a quick shower

11:16.043 --> 11:17.308
and then we're gonna
work on your report.

11:17.411 --> 11:18.109
Okay?

11:18.211 --> 11:19.444
- [Ian] Sure.

11:19.546 --> 11:26.718
- And take a break
from the camera.

11:26.753 --> 11:42.033
(calming music)
(shower runs)

12:03.523 --> 12:05.724
(door slamming)

12:05.826 --> 12:10.862
(door slamming)

12:10.897 --> 12:12.897
Ian?

12:12.999 --> 12:14.566
Honey?

12:14.668 --> 12:20.071
(door slamming)

12:20.173 --> 12:31.716
(door slamming)

12:31.752 --> 12:40.592
(door slamming)

12:40.694 --> 12:42.627
(sigh)

12:42.696 --> 12:58.643
I gotta get this fixed?

12:59.045 --> 12:59.077
Okay, good.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.047
- Can I be done now?

13:03.083 --> 13:04.415
- Not until the report is done.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.584
Read it to me one more time.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.387
- But it's not like I'm
actually gonna be able to do it.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.423
- But you just read it to
me beautifully yesterday.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.258
- Well, because it was just you.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.059
But when there are
other people...

13:15.095 --> 13:18.363
- Look, you're not gonna get
comfortable with other people

13:18.465 --> 13:20.498
without actually doing it.

13:20.634 --> 13:21.332
- Doing it?

13:21.401 --> 13:24.536
- Yes. Like with
your classmates.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.605
Look, if you want to do
all these amazing things

13:27.641 --> 13:31.209
like going to tech camp and-

13:31.244 --> 13:31.576
- Working at SpaceX?

13:31.812 --> 13:32.777
- Exactly!

13:32.813 --> 13:34.579
(Ian chuckling)

13:34.614 --> 13:35.713
Landing that SpaceX job,

13:35.749 --> 13:38.249
means you're gonna
have to be comfortable

13:38.285 --> 13:39.784
in front of other people.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.553
- But they laughed.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.387
- So what?

13:42.489 --> 13:45.023
Let them laugh.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.192
That's what kids do when they
don't understand something.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.694
And trust me, tech
camp and SpaceX

13:49.830 --> 13:51.930
is way above their
tiny little heads.

13:51.965 --> 13:52.730
(Ian chuckles)

13:52.766 --> 13:53.431
- Tiny little heads.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.133
- Come on, you got 20 minutes.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.467
One more time.

13:56.503 --> 14:01.940
Sit up straight.

14:01.975 --> 14:02.941
- Good afternoon.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.776
My name is Ian Jackson
and I am 14 years old.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.679
I've always been fascinated
by all things STEM,

14:07.781 --> 14:10.815
and I'm excited about
spending my summer at SpaceX.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.918
- Boom.

14:13.954 --> 14:29.901
(calming ambient music)

15:12.913 --> 15:15.747
(camera whirs)

15:15.849 --> 15:17.682
(unnerving music)

15:17.717 --> 15:28.993
- Huh?

15:29.095 --> 15:33.531
Who...

15:33.566 --> 15:36.067
What?

15:36.102 --> 15:37.835
(tense music)

15:37.871 --> 15:44.943
No!

15:45.045 --> 15:47.478
Oh, god.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.381
No!

15:50.417 --> 16:05.997
(intense music)

16:06.066 --> 16:07.565
(Ian screams)

16:07.600 --> 16:08.566
- Ian!

16:08.601 --> 16:10.001
- No!

16:10.070 --> 16:12.704
No!

16:12.806 --> 16:13.504
- Honey?

16:13.640 --> 16:14.272
- [Ian] No!

16:14.307 --> 16:14.939
- Honey?
- No! No!

16:14.975 --> 16:16.374
- Hey, hey, what's going on?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.910
- No, no, no, no!

16:18.945 --> 16:19.811
No!

16:19.846 --> 16:21.846
- It's okay, it's
all right, it's okay.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.349
Hey, hey.
- No!

16:24.484 --> 16:29.053
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6....

16:29.089 --> 16:34.025
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

16:34.160 --> 16:38.963
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6....

16:38.999 --> 16:42.734
(Leila whispers)

16:42.836 --> 16:45.103
1,2,3,4,5,6 ...

16:45.138 --> 16:47.939
(calming music)

16:47.974 --> 16:49.741
(Ian whispering)

16:49.843 --> 17:00.418
1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6...

17:00.520 --> 17:16.467
(calming music)

17:40.660 --> 17:56.607
(camera beeps)

18:00.013 --> 18:06.584
(door slams)

18:06.686 --> 18:09.153
- God.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.890
What?

18:12.926 --> 18:17.361
This door.

18:17.397 --> 18:33.344
(door slams)

18:35.582 --> 18:37.014
(Leila screams)
- Oh my god.

18:37.050 --> 18:39.383
- Oh my god.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.384
- I'm sorry.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.819
- What are you
doing in my house?

18:41.955 --> 18:43.087
- The door was open and
I rang the doorbell,

18:43.123 --> 18:44.522
but nobody seemed to hear me.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.190
- Oh, yeah. The
door is broken and-

18:46.226 --> 18:48.226
- Yes. I can fix it.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.827
You want me to fix it?

18:49.963 --> 18:50.862
- Neil.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.029
- Leila, right?
- Yes.

18:52.065 --> 18:52.630
I'm glad it was you.

18:52.665 --> 18:53.064
- [Neil] You scared me.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.832
(Leila chuckles)

18:54.901 --> 18:56.167
- You scared me.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.535
- I'm sorry.

18:57.570 --> 18:58.402
(Neil groans)

18:58.438 --> 19:00.037
Like I said, this is what I do.

19:00.073 --> 19:01.038
All right?

19:01.074 --> 19:02.840
So just let me know if
there's anything else

19:02.976 --> 19:03.241
that needs work around here.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.008
- Oh.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.009
- No charge.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.713
- Wow. That's very generous.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.581
But you know, I already
called a handyman.

19:10.617 --> 19:11.516
- There.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.584
Good as new.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.721
Are you sure I can't help
you with anything else?

19:16.756 --> 19:17.555
- Thank you.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.423
(Leila chuckles)

19:19.459 --> 19:21.759
But you know, my son,

19:21.794 --> 19:23.027
he got upset about
something earlier

19:23.163 --> 19:25.062
and he's resting now, so
I should go check on him.

19:25.098 --> 19:27.532
- Yeah, is he okay?

19:27.667 --> 19:28.599
- Yeah.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.535
It's just sometimes
it's the smallest things

19:30.603 --> 19:31.736
that can like...

19:31.771 --> 19:32.537
- [Neil] Yeah.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.304
- Yeah.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.372
(Leila chuckles)

19:34.407 --> 19:38.242
- Well, he's lucky to
have you and your husband.

19:38.278 --> 19:42.747
- My husband unfortunately
passed away three months ago,

19:42.782 --> 19:45.316
so that's definitely part of it.

19:45.351 --> 19:45.983
- [Neil] Wow.

19:46.019 --> 19:46.417
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.553
That's terrible.

19:48.688 --> 19:52.089
- It's okay.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.791
Actually, it's not.

19:53.826 --> 19:54.859
It's not okay.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.161
But...

19:57.197 --> 20:00.298
Thank you.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.165
- Of course.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.233
Look, you have my card.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.401
- I do.

20:03.469 --> 20:06.971
- Just call me if there's
anything you guys need.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.172
- All right.

20:08.208 --> 20:24.455
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

20:24.490 --> 20:36.667
(doorbell rings)

20:36.703 --> 20:46.677
Ugh.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.512
(door creaks)

20:48.548 --> 20:49.480
- Oh, good afternoon, ma'am.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.082
I'm here from the
repair company.

20:51.184 --> 20:52.116
- Oh, yes

20:52.151 --> 20:54.619
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.120
- Oh, it's my pleasure, ma'am.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.288
Geez, you have a lovely home.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.923
- Well, it needs some updating.

20:59.025 --> 20:59.790
(Dominic chuckles)

20:59.826 --> 21:00.825
- Well, that's
what I'm here for.

21:00.994 --> 21:02.593
Now, the work order said
you were having trouble

21:02.695 --> 21:03.761
with the front door?

21:03.863 --> 21:05.796
- Yes, but that got fixed,

21:05.832 --> 21:06.664
but there's a whole lot of
other things that need work.

21:06.699 --> 21:07.765
I'll show you the kitchen first.

21:07.867 --> 21:08.666
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.501
Excuse me.

21:10.536 --> 21:10.935
- Yep.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.870
(door creaks)

21:12.905 --> 21:15.473
Yeah, so, we're
gonna go this way.

21:15.508 --> 21:16.941
You don't have to lug
your bag the whole way,

21:17.043 --> 21:17.942
you can just leave
it right there.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.044
I'm just gonna
show you out back.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.579
Careful.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.147
It's a hot mess out here.

21:23.182 --> 21:23.981
(Leila chuckles)
- Oh, wow.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.950
That's an awfully large space.

21:26.052 --> 21:26.751
- Yeah.

21:26.853 --> 21:27.618
I want to put a garden one day.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.288
- Sure.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.689
- Careful.
- Okay.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.791
- That was the garage.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.693
There's a lot for
you to do out here.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.329
And then we'll just
go up through here.

21:38.364 --> 21:39.497
Careful, that's broken too.

21:39.532 --> 21:40.731
- Oh. Well, put it on the list.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.833
- [Leila] Put it on the list.
These steps are kinda tight.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.835
- Oh, thank you.

21:44.871 --> 21:48.973
- Up there, the heating
unit is in the attic.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.374
Not in there, that's
my son's room.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.242
- Oh, sorry.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.343
- He doesn't do
well with strangers,

21:52.378 --> 21:53.077
and he's resting right now.

21:53.246 --> 21:55.246
- I'm sorry, that's my mistake.

21:55.281 --> 21:56.314
- No problem.

21:56.349 --> 21:57.615
The ladder to the attic
is in the storage room.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.917
It's not locked, and I need
you to work really fast.

21:59.952 --> 22:00.885
- Sure.

22:01.054 --> 22:01.686
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

22:01.721 --> 22:02.853
- Sure, no problem.

22:02.889 --> 22:03.654
- Thank you so-
- I'll be right back.

22:03.756 --> 22:19.704
- Okay, thank you.

22:32.785 --> 22:42.159
(water pours)

22:42.261 --> 22:52.236
(fridge shuts)

22:52.271 --> 22:54.171
- What are you doing in here?

22:54.273 --> 22:56.340
- Oh, I was just checking
the vents, ma'am.

22:56.442 --> 22:58.542
- No, I thought that
I made it very clear

22:58.644 --> 23:00.277
that my son's room
was off limits.

23:00.313 --> 23:02.079
- Well, I need to
check all the vents

23:02.115 --> 23:03.814
in order to figure out where
the problem in the system is.

23:03.850 --> 23:06.083
And so since you
mentioned your son-

23:06.119 --> 23:08.886
- What I mentioned was not
to go into my son's room.

23:08.988 --> 23:10.654
Got it?

23:10.690 --> 23:11.455
- Yeah.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.457
I'm sorry if I
overstepped, okay?

23:13.493 --> 23:15.126
I'm just trying to do my job.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.360
- [Ian] Mom?

23:16.462 --> 23:17.161
- No.

23:17.196 --> 23:17.962
- Mom?

23:17.997 --> 23:19.130
- Ian, it's okay, honey.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.931
- [Ian] Mom.
- No, it's okay, little man.

23:20.967 --> 23:21.832
- He's just checking the vents.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.834
- Mhm.
- Mom?

23:23.870 --> 23:24.802
- Look...

23:24.837 --> 23:26.103
You need to go, now.

23:26.139 --> 23:28.305
- Well-
- Ma!

23:28.341 --> 23:29.106
- No, listen.

23:29.142 --> 23:29.874
- Get out of my
house, right now!

23:29.909 --> 23:30.908
- Ma'am, if I could just-
- No.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.443
- If I could just try to
explain something to you.

23:32.478 --> 23:33.377
- Get out of my house.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.378
- There's something
that you need to...

23:34.480 --> 23:36.113
(both yelling)

23:36.149 --> 23:37.915
- Mom, Mom!
- Listen to me, listen!

23:38.017 --> 23:39.016
- Get out of my...

23:39.051 --> 23:39.884
- I'll get out of your
house when you give me...

23:39.986 --> 23:41.719
(lamp shatters)

23:41.821 --> 23:43.988
- Let's go, go!

23:44.023 --> 23:45.823
(Dominic groans)

23:45.858 --> 23:48.459
Run, baby!

23:48.494 --> 23:48.893
Lock the safe space.

23:48.928 --> 23:52.329
(dramatic music)

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
(dramatic music)

23:56.035 --> 23:57.902
(Dominic grunts)

23:57.937 --> 23:58.702
Open the door!

23:58.805 --> 24:00.321
Go in!

24:00.423 --> 24:02.022
Lady!

24:02.125 --> 24:05.759
(Leila screams)

24:05.795 --> 24:06.894
- Get away from us!

24:06.929 --> 24:09.930
- Stop fighting me!

24:09.966 --> 24:11.198
(glass shatters)

24:11.234 --> 24:18.372
(Dominic grunts)

24:18.407 --> 24:22.843
(Dominic groans)

24:22.945 --> 24:27.148
(tense music)

24:27.183 --> 24:29.350
Open this door!

24:29.452 --> 24:30.151
Open this door right now!
- Mom.

24:30.186 --> 24:32.219
- Open it!
- You're bleeding.

24:32.321 --> 24:34.922
- It's okay, baby.

24:34.957 --> 24:37.124
- Open this door!

24:37.160 --> 24:39.026
- [Leila] It's okay.

24:39.128 --> 24:40.494
- My bracelet.

24:40.530 --> 24:41.295
- [Leila] What?

24:41.330 --> 24:42.062
- It ripped.

24:42.098 --> 24:42.730
- Oh, no, no, no,
no, don't worry.

24:42.965 --> 24:44.098
Don't worry, we'll find it.

24:44.133 --> 24:47.201
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

24:47.303 --> 24:49.170
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

24:49.205 --> 24:52.239
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

24:52.275 --> 24:52.973
- You know what?

24:53.176 --> 24:55.376
Why don't we clean up a little.

24:55.511 --> 24:59.480
We should put your poster back.

24:59.515 --> 25:02.116
We'll just...

25:02.151 --> 25:05.219
You know, what was the
name of the flight capsule

25:05.321 --> 25:06.220
on the SpaceX?

25:06.322 --> 25:07.488
Was it Butterfly?

25:07.523 --> 25:08.422
- No, it was Dragonfly.

25:08.524 --> 25:09.156
- [Leila] It was Dragonfly.

25:09.192 --> 25:10.124
- It was Dragonfly.

25:10.159 --> 25:12.059
It was named after the
Peter, Paul and Mary

25:12.161 --> 25:14.195
hit song "Puff
the Magic Dragon".

25:14.230 --> 25:15.162
- That's right!

25:15.331 --> 25:17.231
And what was it that
they took on the flight?

25:17.333 --> 25:18.999
I can't remember.

25:19.035 --> 25:20.601
- A wheel of cheese.

25:20.703 --> 25:25.139
It was of a secret until the
spacecraft went out of orbit

25:25.174 --> 25:26.106
and crashed into
the Pacific Ocean.

25:26.209 --> 25:27.174
- That's right.

25:27.210 --> 25:29.643
I want you to listen.

25:29.679 --> 25:32.313
- Okay.
- Okay? Here you go.

25:32.348 --> 25:36.684
Just relax for a second, okay?

25:36.719 --> 25:38.018
(tense music)

25:38.054 --> 25:44.558
What is he looking for?

25:44.594 --> 26:00.541
(objects clanging)
(tense music)

26:01.277 --> 26:02.876
- Where is it?

26:02.912 --> 26:03.410
Better open this door!

26:03.579 --> 26:05.145
You better open it!

26:05.248 --> 26:06.347
- Look, I have
money in my wallet.

26:06.382 --> 26:07.281
Cash, credit cards.

26:07.383 --> 26:09.350
You could take
whatever you want.

26:09.385 --> 26:11.485
- I don't want your money, okay?

26:11.587 --> 26:13.487
And trust me, I don't
want to be here.

26:13.589 --> 26:14.622
All right?

26:14.724 --> 26:16.724
Just hand over the camera,
and I'm walking away.

26:16.759 --> 26:17.625
- What camera?

26:17.660 --> 26:21.929
- Your son's camera,
that's all I want.

26:21.964 --> 26:22.463
- It's old, it's cheap.

26:22.498 --> 26:25.032
It's not worth $50.

26:25.067 --> 26:28.802
- Lady, your son recorded
something on his camera.

26:28.938 --> 26:30.871
- [Leila] Recorded what?

26:30.906 --> 26:32.106
- If you don't know,

26:32.141 --> 26:34.742
it's probably better
we keep it that way.

26:34.777 --> 26:35.209
- Oh, god.

26:35.244 --> 26:38.479
Look.

26:38.581 --> 26:41.749
- Um, my son is autistic.

26:41.784 --> 26:45.886
I bet he doesn't even
know what he saw.

26:45.921 --> 26:47.655
You don't have to attack us.

26:47.790 --> 26:48.589
- Hey, I freaked out.

26:48.624 --> 26:49.356
Okay? I'm sorry.

26:49.392 --> 26:50.391
I freaked out.

26:50.593 --> 26:53.060
Just hand over the camera
and I'll get outta here.

26:53.095 --> 26:54.595
- That's it, you
promised to leave.

26:54.630 --> 26:56.196
If I tell you where
the camera is-

26:56.299 --> 27:00.567
- You will never
see my face again.

27:00.603 --> 27:02.169
- Okay.

27:02.271 --> 27:04.905
It's in his room.

27:04.940 --> 27:07.007
In the pink beanbag.

27:07.109 --> 27:18.752
(tense music)

27:18.788 --> 27:21.822
- Uh...

27:21.857 --> 27:32.866
(tense music)

27:32.968 --> 27:34.034
I got the camera.

27:34.170 --> 27:34.802
- All right.

27:34.837 --> 27:36.070
So now you can leave.

27:36.172 --> 27:38.005
- Not so fast, okay?

27:38.040 --> 27:39.406
I gotta delete the copies.

27:39.508 --> 27:40.808
- [Leila] There are no copies!

27:40.843 --> 27:41.909
- Come on, lady.

27:41.944 --> 27:43.711
You and I both know
everything's in the cloud now.

27:43.813 --> 27:44.478
I have the camera,
but I gotta make sure

27:44.513 --> 27:48.148
that the backups are deleted.

27:48.184 --> 27:49.583
- Oh my god.

27:49.618 --> 27:58.325
(tense music)

27:58.361 --> 28:02.429
Like I said, he doesn't
know what he saw.

28:02.531 --> 28:05.599
He has a hard time
processing complex emotions.

28:05.701 --> 28:07.801
He is not a threat to you.

28:07.837 --> 28:08.802
- I want to believe
you. I really do.

28:08.838 --> 28:11.739
And if it were up to me,
I'd be long gone by now.

28:11.874 --> 28:13.374
- [Leila] Well, who
the hell is it up?

28:13.409 --> 28:15.275
- Dangerous people, okay?

28:15.378 --> 28:16.844
Dangerous people that you
don't want to mess with,

28:16.879 --> 28:18.612
and I don't want to mess with.

28:18.714 --> 28:19.780
All right?

28:19.882 --> 28:23.283
So I need to erase this,
and you need to erase this.

28:23.386 --> 28:25.486
Here's what's gonna happen.

28:25.521 --> 28:26.453
You're gonna come out here.

28:26.555 --> 28:28.355
We're gonna go delete the files,

28:28.391 --> 28:30.624
and then I'm gonna go.

28:30.726 --> 28:32.459
- And I'm supposed to believe

28:32.561 --> 28:33.594
that you'll keep your word?

28:33.696 --> 28:35.028
- You don't have
to trust me, lady.

28:35.064 --> 28:37.197
You just have to do what I say.

28:37.233 --> 28:42.803
(tense music)

28:42.905 --> 28:44.238
- Okay.

28:44.273 --> 28:50.511
I will come out.

28:50.546 --> 28:54.281
I will come out, but
Ian stays behind.

28:54.383 --> 28:57.050
- I can work with that.

28:57.086 --> 28:59.319
- And we're gonna go downstairs,

28:59.422 --> 29:01.388
and we're gonna
delete your video,

29:01.424 --> 29:02.356
and then you'll leave?

29:02.391 --> 29:03.340
- You have my word.

29:03.375 --> 29:08.045
- Well, that doesn't
mean anything.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.481
You have to wait at
the end of the hallway.

29:10.583 --> 29:16.720
- Fine.

29:16.755 --> 29:22.226
- End of the hallway!

29:22.261 --> 29:23.961
Ian.

29:24.063 --> 29:27.397
Honey.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.133
I'm gonna leave the
room for a while.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.467
Okay?
- No, no, no.

29:30.569 --> 29:31.969
- Listen, listen, listen. Don't
be scared. Don't be scared.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.537
Listen, I'm coming back.

29:33.572 --> 29:38.375
But I need you to do
something for me, okay?

29:38.410 --> 29:41.912
I need you to
watch that monitor,

29:41.947 --> 29:44.047
and you don't open that door

29:44.083 --> 29:47.518
until you see my face.

29:47.553 --> 29:48.285
Hey.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.286
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

29:49.321 --> 29:51.755
- Yes.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.356
- Okay.

29:52.458 --> 30:01.265
Okay.

30:01.300 --> 30:14.278
(tense music)

30:14.313 --> 30:16.180
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't do anything stupid.

30:16.282 --> 30:17.548
- It's my son's bracelet.

30:17.650 --> 30:23.086
- I don't care!

30:23.122 --> 30:23.854
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.056
What do you got there?

30:26.158 --> 30:31.361
- He has panic attacks.
This calms him down.

30:31.463 --> 30:35.232
- Don't make me hurt you.

30:35.334 --> 30:39.937
- It's downstairs.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.138
- Go.

30:41.173 --> 30:48.545
(tense music)

30:48.647 --> 30:52.249
(laptop beeps)

30:52.351 --> 30:53.317
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.251
What did I say about
messing with me?

30:54.353 --> 30:55.285
- I'm not, I'm not.

30:55.321 --> 30:58.755
Just let me try again.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.624
- Get it right!

31:00.659 --> 31:03.760
- Okay.

31:03.862 --> 31:19.810
(mysterious music)

31:21.413 --> 31:22.779
There.

31:22.815 --> 31:26.450
Are we good now?

31:26.552 --> 31:27.985
- How do I know you're
not gonna go to the cops

31:28.020 --> 31:30.020
the moment I walk?

31:30.055 --> 31:32.589
- I don't care about you.

31:32.691 --> 31:36.193
I just care about
my son's safety.

31:36.228 --> 31:45.235
Walk away and I will
forget you were even here.

31:45.271 --> 31:56.346
(tense music)

31:56.382 --> 31:58.982
- [Woman] These crab cakes suck.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.117
Everybody is always
bragging about

32:00.219 --> 32:01.818
how these are the best
things since sliced bread,

32:01.920 --> 32:03.820
but if you ask me, I'd
take a piece of focaccia

32:03.856 --> 32:06.990
dipped in olive oil
any day of the week.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.492
- Who are you?

32:08.594 --> 32:11.128
How did you get in my house?

32:11.230 --> 32:12.696
- The back door.

32:12.731 --> 32:15.065
What happened to your face?
- What are you doing in here?

32:15.100 --> 32:16.333
- Well, you were taking forever.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.868
I had to come check it out.

32:17.903 --> 32:18.869
Did she do this to your face?

32:18.904 --> 32:21.071
- It's nothing. Look,
I got what I came for.

32:21.106 --> 32:21.838
Let's get out of here.

32:21.874 --> 32:22.739
- Okay, good.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.474
And the kid?

32:24.610 --> 32:25.275
- What does that mean?

32:25.311 --> 32:26.443
- [Man] Hey, we're done here.

32:26.478 --> 32:29.513
- Oh, actually we're not.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.415
- Please, we are not a threat.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.351
- Hey, yo, what happened
before was a mistake.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.619
You understand? We got what
we came for, we get out now,

32:35.654 --> 32:37.421
we don't have to deal with
any blow back. Let's just go.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.723
- And what if the kid IDs us?

32:39.758 --> 32:42.025
Do I have to remind you that
he's seen both of our faces?

32:42.061 --> 32:44.061
- No, no, no.

32:44.096 --> 32:47.030
My kid is autistic.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.598
He can barely
process what he sees,

32:48.634 --> 32:50.200
let alone be a credible witness.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.368
You've met Ian.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.336
Please tell her that he
is not a threat to anyone.

32:52.438 --> 32:55.439
- She's telling the truth.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.574
- Let me be the judge of that.

32:57.609 --> 32:58.575
Bring the boy down.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.143
I mean, if he's such a
harmless little bunny,

33:00.179 --> 33:01.545
then it shouldn't be a
problem if I meet him, right?

33:01.647 --> 33:04.281
- Look you're out of your mind

33:04.316 --> 33:06.049
if you think that I'm
gonna bring my son

33:06.151 --> 33:07.551
in front of the both of you.

33:07.586 --> 33:08.518
- Let's just-

33:08.554 --> 33:21.431
- Go wait outside if
you're not gonna help.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.934
Never send a man to
do a woman's job.

33:23.969 --> 33:26.103
Am I right?

33:26.138 --> 33:26.937
- Right?

33:26.972 --> 33:29.473
Look, sis.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.842
It doesn't have to be like this.

33:31.877 --> 33:33.610
I have a hustle.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.979
I can imagine that your
hustle's much tougher than mine

33:36.014 --> 33:37.948
considering the line
of work that you're in.

33:37.983 --> 33:41.885
But us girls got
to stick together.

33:41.987 --> 33:44.287
Right?

33:44.323 --> 33:49.793
- Bring the boy down, sis.

33:49.828 --> 33:50.861
- Screw you!

33:50.896 --> 33:52.462
(tense music)

33:52.498 --> 33:53.397
- [Operator] 9-1-1.

33:53.499 --> 33:56.800
(Leila screams)

33:56.835 --> 33:57.601
- [Operator] Ma'am?

33:57.703 --> 33:59.770
- Please, help us, please!

33:59.872 --> 34:00.670
- Hey!

34:00.706 --> 34:03.173
It's a false alarm.
No emergency.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.841
Fun time's over, sweetheart.

34:04.877 --> 34:11.548
(Rocco groans)
(Leila grunts)

34:11.583 --> 34:13.784
(Rocco yells)

34:13.886 --> 34:14.518
You shouldn't of done that.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.787
You shouldn't of done that.

34:16.822 --> 34:19.756
I'm gonna get your son.

34:19.858 --> 34:20.557
Ow.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.959
Ah!

34:22.995 --> 34:32.436
(tense music)
(Rocco screams)

34:32.538 --> 34:34.604
- Ian!

34:34.706 --> 34:35.672
Baby.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.219
Okay, we're safe.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.988
We're safe, baby.

34:52.024 --> 34:52.656
It's okay, look.

34:52.758 --> 34:56.026
1, 2...

34:56.061 --> 34:59.129
3, 4.
- 3, 4.

34:59.231 --> 35:02.666
5, 6.

35:02.768 --> 35:06.002
- 1, 2...

35:06.104 --> 35:08.905
- 3, 4...

35:08.941 --> 35:10.540
5, 6.

35:10.576 --> 35:14.644
Mom, that lady...

35:14.680 --> 35:15.879
I saw her.

35:15.914 --> 35:17.614
- You know her?

35:17.749 --> 35:18.815
Oh my god.

35:18.851 --> 35:22.719
Ian, please tell me whatever
it is you can tell me.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.888
I got to know why these
people are after us.

35:24.923 --> 35:27.057
Oh my god. What did you see?

35:27.092 --> 35:28.825
- They killed that
neighbor lady.

35:28.861 --> 35:30.560
I saw them.

35:30.596 --> 35:32.362
- Oh my god, oh my god.

35:32.397 --> 35:36.132
I'm so sorry you
saw any of that.

35:36.268 --> 35:39.302
- I couldn't tell
you before because...

35:39.438 --> 35:41.671
The woman said she'd kill me.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.607
- I'm not gonna let that happen.

35:43.709 --> 35:44.474
Do you hear me?

35:44.610 --> 35:46.910
I'm not gonna let that happen.

35:46.945 --> 35:48.211
Oh my god.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.146
- I'm sorry for
getting us in trouble.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.048
- Honey, you are not in trouble.

35:52.084 --> 35:55.652
But they cannot know that
you told me what you saw.

35:55.787 --> 35:56.853
Do you understand?

35:56.955 --> 35:58.889
They got to believe that
you can't process any of it.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.690
Okay?

36:00.726 --> 36:01.191
- But I can process
every detail of it.

36:01.226 --> 36:01.958
- No, I know that.

36:02.060 --> 36:04.027
I know that, Ian.

36:04.129 --> 36:04.828
But listen to me.

36:04.963 --> 36:05.195
They...

36:05.297 --> 36:07.397
....

36:07.432 --> 36:09.032
- You said the "S" word.

36:09.067 --> 36:11.735
- Yes, I did, I'm sorry.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.537
Look, it's not your fault.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.939
I let that man in because I
thought he was the handyman.

36:15.974 --> 36:19.309
- But they usually
wear uniforms.

36:19.411 --> 36:20.443
- Yes, of course.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.012
- And you always have to
ask for signed credentials

36:22.147 --> 36:23.547
and work orders, Mom.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.081
- Yes.

36:25.117 --> 36:26.950
You're right, thank you.

36:26.985 --> 36:28.852
- You're welcome.

36:28.987 --> 36:33.456
As long as you stay
here, we'll be all right.

36:33.492 --> 36:42.699
- Yes.

36:42.768 --> 36:58.715
(tense music)

37:18.537 --> 37:20.904
- Hey, I've been waiting
out there forever...

37:21.039 --> 37:21.871
What happened to you?

37:21.907 --> 37:25.375
- The same thing
that happened to you.

37:25.477 --> 37:26.142
- Where is she?

37:26.178 --> 37:26.977
- In that room, with the lock.

37:27.212 --> 37:29.012
- You know what?
What do you expect?

37:29.047 --> 37:30.347
You threatened her son, of
course she's gonna fight back.

37:30.382 --> 37:31.915
- If you had taken care of
the brat in the first place,

37:32.050 --> 37:33.650
we wouldn't be here.

37:33.685 --> 37:34.351
- I rob houses, okay?

37:34.553 --> 37:36.987
I didn't sign up to be a killer.

37:37.022 --> 37:39.623
(tense music)
(Rocco sighs)

37:39.658 --> 37:40.757
- I should've known you
didn't have the balls

37:40.892 --> 37:41.958
to get the job done.

37:42.060 --> 37:42.959
- You're the one that
smashed the lady's head in,

37:42.995 --> 37:44.594
you should be the
one to clean it up.

37:44.730 --> 37:45.996
- Forget about what
happened before.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.263
Okay?

37:47.299 --> 37:50.000
We are in it now, and we have
to take care of both of them.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.434
Are we cool?

37:51.570 --> 37:52.102
Or are you part of the problem?

37:52.170 --> 37:54.938
(doorbell rings)

37:55.073 --> 37:56.206
- Oh my god, it's the handyman

37:56.241 --> 37:57.507
from the repair
service I called.

37:57.542 --> 37:58.642
- Hello?

37:58.677 --> 38:00.176
- I'll take care of this.

38:00.212 --> 38:03.747
(Rocco groans)

38:03.849 --> 38:04.748
Oh, god.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.450
Okay, you just go
upstairs and watch her.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.352
(tense music)

38:09.388 --> 38:11.154
(doorbell rings)

38:11.256 --> 38:11.921
- Can he help us?

38:12.024 --> 38:13.289
- Hello?

38:13.425 --> 38:14.124
- Can you hear me?
- Hello?

38:14.259 --> 38:16.893
- Hi, my name is Leila Jackson.

38:16.928 --> 38:19.896
My son and I are being held
hostage by these people.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.164
Please help us.

38:21.266 --> 38:24.067
- Hello?

38:24.102 --> 38:26.169
Can you hear me?

38:26.271 --> 38:28.672
- Can you hear-
- Hello?

38:28.707 --> 38:30.306
Can you hear me?
- Hello?

38:30.375 --> 38:32.142
(doorbell rings)
Hello?

38:32.277 --> 38:34.711
Hey, can you hear me?
- Hey.

38:34.746 --> 38:35.578
Can I help you?

38:35.614 --> 38:37.580
- Yeah. Is Ms. Jackson home?

38:37.616 --> 38:37.947
- I'm Ms. Jackson.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.883
- You are?

38:39.918 --> 38:40.850
- No, no, no!
- What?

38:40.886 --> 38:42.118
I can't be Ms. Jackson?

38:42.220 --> 38:43.420
Hello?

38:43.455 --> 38:45.021
- No, ma'am, it's just you
sound different over the phone.

38:45.123 --> 38:45.989
- Oh.

38:46.058 --> 38:47.023
So now voice expert's
part of your job.

38:47.059 --> 38:49.325
- No. No disrespect.

38:49.461 --> 38:51.361
I'm just here to fix the door-

38:51.463 --> 38:52.429
- Please help us!

38:52.464 --> 38:53.530
- I don't think he can hear you.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.365
- From where I'm standing,
the door works just fine.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.400
And the heat's good.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.369
So, you got the wrong house.

38:59.404 --> 39:00.904
- I have the work order here.

39:00.939 --> 39:05.341
- I said you got
the wrong house.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.744
- Is this 2122 West
Elm Ave? Correct?

39:07.779 --> 39:08.745
- Now you've got
me wondering why

39:08.980 --> 39:10.847
you're trying so hard
to get into my house.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.549
Huh?

39:12.584 --> 39:15.385
(radio static)

39:15.420 --> 39:17.020
- Please!
- I can fix that too.

39:17.155 --> 39:19.456
We're a full service company.

39:19.491 --> 39:28.131
(tense music)

39:28.166 --> 39:30.433
- It's time to go.

39:30.469 --> 39:31.334
- All right then.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.836
You have a good day, ma'am.
- You too.

39:32.938 --> 39:36.773
- No!

39:36.808 --> 39:39.743
The audio isn't working!

39:39.778 --> 39:42.078
- Mom-
- It was never fixed on time!

39:42.114 --> 39:44.214
- You're screaming.

39:44.349 --> 39:45.615
- I know.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.751
I know, I'm sorry, baby.

39:47.786 --> 39:48.418
I'm sorry.

39:48.453 --> 39:50.053
I'm gonna find another way.

39:50.188 --> 39:52.222
I'm gonna find another way.

39:52.357 --> 39:54.591
Oh my god.

39:54.626 --> 39:58.261
You haven't eaten your lunch.

39:58.296 --> 39:59.262
- I am pretty hungry.

39:59.297 --> 40:07.103
- Yeah, let's get you
a cup, and some water.

40:07.205 --> 40:08.505
Here. Sit down.

40:08.540 --> 40:11.441
- [Ian] Okay.

40:11.476 --> 40:14.911
- I didn't think we'd be
needing this place so soon.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.147
All right.

40:17.182 --> 40:18.381
I'm cutting.

40:18.483 --> 40:24.187
Okay?

40:24.222 --> 40:28.858
Now pushing, okay?

40:28.894 --> 40:33.329
There you go.

40:33.365 --> 40:36.332
It's not much, but...

40:36.368 --> 40:39.702
- Well, what about you?

40:39.738 --> 40:41.471
- No, we're just gonna
focus on you for now.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.206
Okay?

40:43.241 --> 40:46.643
I don't know how much longer
we're gonna be in here.

40:46.678 --> 40:53.216
So, you eat.

40:53.251 --> 40:59.956
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

41:00.091 --> 41:02.692
I love you so much.

41:02.727 --> 41:04.727
- I love you too.

41:04.763 --> 41:06.296
- [Woman] Hey, little piggies,
it's the Big Bad Wolf,

41:06.431 --> 41:09.199
ready to huff and puff
and blow your house down.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.668
- You don't listen to her.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.303
I want you to take that
SpaceX brain of yours,

41:13.438 --> 41:14.170
and fix the intercom.

41:14.206 --> 41:16.172
Do you think you can do that?

41:16.208 --> 41:17.974
- I can try.

41:18.109 --> 41:19.509
- Okay.

41:19.544 --> 41:21.444
I know you can, baby.

41:21.546 --> 41:25.381
Okay.

41:25.417 --> 41:28.885
(Rocco sighs)

41:28.920 --> 41:30.053
- Hey!

41:30.088 --> 41:33.189
How long can your kid
go without eating for?

41:33.225 --> 41:35.358
- We have enough supplies to
last us a week, if not longer.

41:35.393 --> 41:38.194
- That's cool, we're
not in a hurry.

41:38.296 --> 41:45.235
We'll wait for as
long as it takes.

41:45.270 --> 41:48.805
- Do you really think
no one will notice?

41:48.907 --> 41:52.275
Ian has a schedule, daily
appointments we never miss.

41:52.310 --> 41:54.677
What do you think
people are gonna do

41:54.813 --> 41:56.212
when we don't show up?

41:56.248 --> 41:58.848
- I think you're lying.

41:58.984 --> 42:02.218
I bet no one's coming,
and it's just you and us.

42:02.254 --> 42:05.822
- Well, go ahead
and test me then.

42:05.924 --> 42:06.723
It's just a matter of time

42:06.758 --> 42:08.725
before someone
notices our absence,

42:08.760 --> 42:14.297
and calls the police, trust me.

42:14.332 --> 42:20.436
- Oh, nice try.

42:20.472 --> 42:22.405
You two are on your own.

42:22.440 --> 42:23.339
And the sooner you get that
through your pretty little head

42:23.375 --> 42:34.050
and start doing as
you're told, the better.

42:34.185 --> 42:35.752
- And what if
she's not bluffing?

42:35.787 --> 42:36.886
You know, the last thing we need

42:37.022 --> 42:41.090
is some nosy do-gooder
poking around.

42:41.126 --> 42:41.724
- Then we kill her.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.060
And whoever else stops by.

42:44.129 --> 42:45.461
- Slow your roll Rocco.

42:45.497 --> 42:46.629
Those are not our orders.

42:46.665 --> 42:47.897
- Well, things changed.

42:48.033 --> 42:48.398
She's messing with us.

42:48.466 --> 42:49.232
Look at me.

42:49.367 --> 42:51.968
- I had everything under control

42:52.003 --> 42:54.137
until you showed up
and blew it all up.

42:54.172 --> 42:55.405
You know, and besides,
I think the last thing

42:55.540 --> 42:56.472
the boss is gonna
want is to have to

42:56.508 --> 42:57.840
get rid of another body.

42:57.876 --> 42:59.442
Besides, this is a mom, okay?

42:59.477 --> 43:02.145
She's not gonna give up her kid.

43:02.180 --> 43:03.112
- [Rocco] Why do I
keep getting the sense

43:03.214 --> 43:04.847
that you're not
on the same team?

43:04.883 --> 43:06.082
- Would you relax already?

43:06.117 --> 43:07.317
I'm just saying that the plan
that we have isn't working.

43:07.352 --> 43:08.551
Okay?

43:08.586 --> 43:09.652
I'm just saying that we should
maybe step back and regroup

43:09.688 --> 43:14.724
and I don't know, just
maybe come back another day.

43:14.826 --> 43:16.326
(Rocco chuckles)
- I'm sorry. Wait a second.

43:16.361 --> 43:17.493
Did you just say come
back another day?

43:17.529 --> 43:18.761
- Yeah, that's what I said.

43:18.797 --> 43:22.332
- You know, why don't we just
turn ourselves in to the cops?

43:22.367 --> 43:23.833
- You know what?
Maybe we should.

43:23.868 --> 43:25.535
Maybe we should, and tell
them that the neighbor lady

43:25.570 --> 43:27.437
across the street
was an accident.

43:27.572 --> 43:27.870
- Yeah, let's do that.

43:27.906 --> 43:28.838
- Yeah.

43:28.873 --> 43:31.441
- And this way you can
be someone's little

43:31.509 --> 43:32.642
- [gasp]
- Yeah. Okay?

43:32.677 --> 43:34.677
The boss is expecting result,

43:34.713 --> 43:37.947
and that's exactly what
we're going to deliver.

43:38.083 --> 43:39.549
- Are we straight?

43:39.584 --> 43:40.650
- Yeah, we're straight.

43:40.685 --> 43:43.953
- Look at me.

43:44.022 --> 43:46.189
Stay put and watch her.

43:46.224 --> 43:56.332
- Where you goin'?

43:56.434 --> 43:57.300
Hey lady, can you hear me?

43:57.435 --> 44:00.670
- Oh my god.

44:00.772 --> 44:02.372
You lied to me.

44:02.407 --> 44:04.640
What do you want now?

44:04.776 --> 44:05.908
- Look.

44:05.944 --> 44:06.509
I kept up my end of the deal.

44:06.544 --> 44:11.848
Okay? I mean, I tried to.

44:11.883 --> 44:14.183
- Then please help us.

44:14.219 --> 44:15.151
- [Man] How?

44:15.286 --> 44:16.285
I mean, my partner's crazy.

44:16.388 --> 44:18.421
- You are never gonna
get away with this.

44:18.456 --> 44:21.090
Do you know what they
do to people in prison

44:21.126 --> 44:22.425
who hurt children?

44:22.460 --> 44:25.328
- Look, I didn't want
any of this. Okay?

44:25.463 --> 44:27.930
I didn't want any of this, and
I don't know how to stop it.

44:27.966 --> 44:30.433
- Well, all you have to
do is call the police

44:30.468 --> 44:34.904
and tell them everything
that happened.

44:34.939 --> 44:36.406
- No, no.

44:36.441 --> 44:37.907
I'm no snitch.

44:37.942 --> 44:38.641
- Oh my god.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.510
What about doing
the right thing?

44:40.578 --> 44:43.413
I will vouch for you. I will
tell them you helped us.

44:43.448 --> 44:45.214
You tried to protect us.

44:45.250 --> 44:51.054
This is your chance
to save yourself.

44:51.089 --> 44:54.157
Hey.

44:54.259 --> 44:59.529
Please help us.

44:59.664 --> 45:01.364
- What are you doing?

45:01.499 --> 45:03.800
- What you should
have done already.

45:03.835 --> 45:04.400
I'm gonna break
down this damn door.

45:06.771 --> 45:10.573
(tool whirs)

45:10.608 --> 45:14.577
(Leila gasps)

45:14.612 --> 45:24.554
- [Leila] Ian.

45:24.589 --> 45:25.655
- Hey, this is crazy.

45:25.757 --> 45:35.364
That door is sturdy as hell.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.366
- This baby's cracked
a dozen safes.

45:37.402 --> 45:42.371
This sucker's coming down.

45:42.407 --> 45:44.340
- I don't think it's working.

45:44.442 --> 45:46.175
- Are you just gonna stand
there or are you gonna help?

45:46.277 --> 45:53.182
- No, this is your
brilliant idea.

45:53.218 --> 45:54.917
(Rocco groans)

45:54.953 --> 45:55.418
- Damn it!

45:55.587 --> 45:57.253
(Dominic chuckles)

45:57.288 --> 46:00.556
- I guess that sucker's
not coming down.

46:00.592 --> 46:02.892
- What is this thing
made of? Vibranium?

46:02.927 --> 46:05.194
- It's tungsten, actually.

46:05.230 --> 46:08.297
It's heat resistant and
virtually impenetrable.

46:08.333 --> 46:11.901
It came with the house.

46:11.936 --> 46:13.503
(Rocco grunts)

46:13.638 --> 46:15.738
- Way to go, genius.

46:15.773 --> 46:18.374
- Shut up.

46:18.476 --> 46:20.076
(doorbell ringing)

46:20.111 --> 46:21.544
(tense music)

46:21.579 --> 46:23.379
Does this frickin'
doorbell ever stop?

46:23.481 --> 46:24.914
- I told you
somebody would come.

46:24.949 --> 46:28.751
You need to get out of
here while you still can.

46:28.786 --> 46:30.520
- If you make even one sound,

46:30.655 --> 46:32.421
whatever happens
is on your head.

46:32.457 --> 46:33.589
All right?

46:33.625 --> 46:34.457
Come on.

46:34.492 --> 46:35.391
Make yourself useful.

46:35.426 --> 46:46.769
(tense music)

46:46.804 --> 46:47.737
- What do we do?

46:47.839 --> 46:51.274
- We don't answer the door.

46:51.309 --> 46:52.975
- Oh...

46:53.011 --> 46:53.709
Ian, honey.

46:53.745 --> 46:57.280
There's a police
officer outside.

46:57.315 --> 46:58.147
- You should ask
for help this time.

46:58.183 --> 46:59.415
- Yes.

46:59.450 --> 47:01.284
So I need you to get this audio
working as fast as you can.

47:01.319 --> 47:02.618
Do you understand? Do you
think you could do that?

47:02.654 --> 47:05.454
- Yeah.
- Okay.

47:05.490 --> 47:07.657
- We ignore her. She'll go away.

47:07.692 --> 47:09.492
- [Officer] CPP. Is anyone home?

47:09.527 --> 47:12.128
- Yeah, I don't think
she's going away.

47:12.163 --> 47:13.029
- Okay.

47:13.198 --> 47:14.730
I will take care-
- No, no, whoa, whoa.

47:14.866 --> 47:16.465
No, look, if you go out
there acting all crazy,

47:16.501 --> 47:17.667
she is gonna know
something is up.

47:17.702 --> 47:18.401
All right?

47:18.503 --> 47:20.770
let me handle it.

47:20.805 --> 47:21.470
- All right.

47:21.706 --> 47:22.672
Always with the soft touch, huh?

47:22.707 --> 47:24.840
- Well, it's better than
blowing everything up

47:24.876 --> 47:26.642
like you always do.

47:26.678 --> 47:27.577
- Okay. Get it done.

47:27.712 --> 47:30.413
If not, I will handle it my way.

47:30.515 --> 47:32.582
- I got this.

47:32.684 --> 47:36.586
(tense music)

47:36.721 --> 47:38.921
- How's it coming along, honey?

47:39.023 --> 47:40.423
- [Ian] Almost.

47:40.525 --> 47:50.266
(tense music)

47:50.368 --> 47:51.300
- Oh.

47:51.402 --> 47:52.535
Evening, officer.

47:52.570 --> 47:53.669
- Good evening, sir.

47:53.705 --> 47:54.670
I'm Officer Armani.

47:54.706 --> 47:55.338
It took you long enough
to get to the door.

47:55.573 --> 47:57.974
- Oh. Yeah, no, I apologize.

47:58.009 --> 48:00.142
- I was in the shower.

48:00.245 --> 48:00.943
- Very good, sir.

48:01.079 --> 48:03.346
- [Man] Officer Armani, was it?

48:03.381 --> 48:04.313
- [Armani] Yes, sir.

48:04.349 --> 48:07.016
- [Man] Officer Armani,
like the designer?

48:07.051 --> 48:07.817
Oh, sorry.

48:07.852 --> 48:09.819
It probably gets old.

48:09.921 --> 48:10.886
- Very.

48:10.922 --> 48:12.054
- How can I help you?

48:12.223 --> 48:14.457
- I'm responding to a 9-1-1
call placed earlier today.

48:14.592 --> 48:16.692
- What, from this house?

48:16.728 --> 48:18.527
- Yes. A woman called
asking for help.

48:18.563 --> 48:20.429
Are you unaware of-

48:20.465 --> 48:22.832
- Oh, no, no, no. Yeah.

48:22.867 --> 48:23.566
I remember.

48:23.768 --> 48:27.370
Sorry, it's just
been a long day.

48:27.405 --> 48:28.404
- Okay.

48:28.573 --> 48:29.472
Well, the call was moved
to the non-emergency list

48:29.574 --> 48:32.541
because the caller
insisted all was well.

48:32.577 --> 48:34.343
- Right.

48:34.445 --> 48:36.412
So, my sister and
her son live here,

48:36.447 --> 48:37.346
- Come on, honey.
- And he has anxiety issues,

48:37.582 --> 48:40.149
and sometimes they
get the better of him,

48:40.285 --> 48:41.751
and he tries to
hurt himself and...

48:41.786 --> 48:45.755
And...

48:45.790 --> 48:46.689
- That sounds difficult.

48:46.724 --> 48:48.557
- Yeah, no, it is. It is.

48:48.593 --> 48:50.359
Yeah, and so he had
an episode today,

48:50.395 --> 48:51.227
and it got out of hand,

48:51.429 --> 48:53.663
and that's why my
sister called 9-1-1.

48:53.798 --> 48:55.331
I was able to get here in time-

48:55.466 --> 48:58.701
- Honey.
- Kinda defuse the situation.

48:58.803 --> 49:01.771
It's always better to
sort of handle things

49:01.806 --> 49:03.239
you know, among the family.

49:03.274 --> 49:04.540
Just 'cause Ian
doesn't do too well

49:04.575 --> 49:05.608
with strangers, you know?

49:05.643 --> 49:07.109
- What happened to your-

49:07.145 --> 49:09.578
- Oh, well, when he
gets really agitated,

49:09.614 --> 49:11.681
he doesn't do too well
with family either.

49:11.783 --> 49:14.016
- Is it possible
that I could speak

49:14.118 --> 49:15.384
to the lady of the house?

49:15.420 --> 49:16.886
- Are you done yet?
- Almost.

49:16.921 --> 49:20.323
- Oh, she's resting now.

49:20.425 --> 49:23.526
So I'd really rather
not disturb her.

49:23.561 --> 49:26.262
She doesn't get
too much time off.

49:26.297 --> 49:29.665
- Hello? Offi...

49:29.767 --> 49:32.134
- It's a good thing she
has you looking out.

49:32.236 --> 49:33.169
- Oh.

49:33.271 --> 49:34.503
I mean, she's the real
hero here. You know?

49:34.605 --> 49:37.373
She's sort of dedicated
her life to her son,

49:37.408 --> 49:41.644
it's just remarkably selfless.

49:41.746 --> 49:43.979
Someone's gotta take
care of her sometimes.

49:44.082 --> 49:44.914
That's where I come in.

49:44.949 --> 49:47.249
(Dominic chuckles)

49:47.285 --> 49:48.584
Anyway, that's what happened.

49:48.619 --> 49:49.919
I'm really sorry you had
to come all the way out.

49:49.954 --> 49:51.153
- Well, that's quite all right.

49:51.255 --> 49:52.054
Routine check.
- Oh.

49:52.090 --> 49:54.223
- So, I'm glad
everything is okay.

49:54.258 --> 49:55.257
- Yeah, me too. Me too.

49:55.293 --> 49:55.925
Thank you.

49:56.094 --> 49:56.759
- [Dispatch] Dispatch here.

49:56.794 --> 50:00.930
Checking on your 10-23, over.

50:00.965 --> 50:03.265
- That's a 10-24, all good.

50:03.301 --> 50:05.234
Signing off.

50:05.269 --> 50:06.035
- [Dispatch] Roger.

50:06.137 --> 50:08.771
Have a good night.

50:08.806 --> 50:15.277
- Listen, if you or your
sister ever need anything,

50:15.313 --> 50:17.179
call me directly.

50:17.315 --> 50:19.048
I'm trained in
mental care services.

50:19.083 --> 50:22.184
So, I would be happy to assist.

50:22.286 --> 50:27.289
(tense music)

50:27.325 --> 50:28.424
Sir, is everything okay?

50:28.459 --> 50:30.226
- Yeah.

50:30.261 --> 50:33.262
Yeah, everything's fine.

50:33.297 --> 50:34.797
Thank you.

50:34.832 --> 50:38.267
- [Leila] Come on, baby.

50:38.302 --> 50:39.402
- Okay.

50:39.504 --> 50:40.870
Have a good night.

50:41.005 --> 50:42.872
- You too.

50:42.974 --> 50:45.641
(tense music)

50:45.676 --> 50:47.877
- Ian, is it done?

50:47.979 --> 50:56.552
- I did my best.

50:56.654 --> 50:58.621
- Hello, Officer?

50:58.656 --> 51:03.893
(dramatic music)

51:05.463 --> 51:06.195
(dramatic music)

51:06.397 --> 51:09.298
Officer, my name
is Leila Jackson!

51:09.400 --> 51:11.333
My son and I are being held
hostage by these people.

51:11.369 --> 51:14.036
Please, do not leave us!

51:14.071 --> 51:16.205
Please. We are inside the house!

51:16.240 --> 51:18.007
- Hands!

51:18.042 --> 51:18.707
- I can explain.

51:18.910 --> 51:20.910
It's just a misunderstanding.

51:20.945 --> 51:21.644
- [Armani] Keep your hands
where I can see them.

51:21.679 --> 51:23.078
- [Man] It's a simple misunder-

51:23.114 --> 51:23.879
- [Armani] Back up!

51:23.915 --> 51:25.414
- [Man] Okay, okay.

51:25.449 --> 51:30.552
- [Armani] Put your
hands on the door!

51:30.588 --> 51:33.322
- Yes, yes, yes.

51:33.424 --> 51:37.226
- Spread 'em.
- Okay.

51:37.261 --> 51:40.029
- Right hand behind your head.

51:40.131 --> 51:40.829
(gunshot booms)

51:40.932 --> 51:44.967
- No, please!

51:45.002 --> 51:49.705
(tense music)

51:49.740 --> 51:51.907
- What happened?

51:51.943 --> 51:54.176
- Oh, god.

51:54.278 --> 51:59.415
Baby.

51:59.450 --> 52:03.919
I'm so sorry, it
was a false alarm.

52:03.955 --> 52:05.287
It's okay.

52:05.323 --> 52:08.757
It's okay.

52:08.793 --> 52:09.892
- [Rocco] Okay.

52:09.994 --> 52:11.026
- [Man] You could've hit me.

52:11.128 --> 52:12.795
- [Rocco] Yeah, I know.

52:12.830 --> 52:15.597
(grunting)

52:15.633 --> 52:17.599
- Oh, god.

52:17.635 --> 52:18.701
You killed a cop!

52:18.803 --> 52:19.468
- Ugh.

52:19.503 --> 52:20.402
Well, it was her fault upstairs.

52:20.438 --> 52:21.804
I mean, I told her, look,

52:21.839 --> 52:23.772
if you try anything stupid,
things are gonna get ugly.

52:23.808 --> 52:24.740
- No, this is your fault!

52:24.775 --> 52:27.443
Just like is everything
always your fault.

52:27.478 --> 52:28.444
Look at this mess!

52:28.479 --> 52:29.945
- Boo hoo!

52:29.981 --> 52:31.880
Just shut up.

52:32.016 --> 52:33.983
And enough with the
good guy routine.

52:34.018 --> 52:35.417
It's boring.

52:35.519 --> 52:37.252
- You're crazy.

52:37.288 --> 52:39.088
- No, no, no.

52:39.190 --> 52:43.892
You haven't even seen crazy.

52:44.028 --> 52:44.960
- [Ian] Well, what
are we gonna do now?

52:44.996 --> 52:47.162
- Our only choice now
is to call for help.

52:47.198 --> 52:49.131
So we're gonna need your phone.

52:49.166 --> 52:51.700
- It's in my safe in my bedroom.

52:51.736 --> 52:52.768
- That's okay.

52:52.803 --> 52:53.168
I'll just go get it now
while they're distracted.

52:53.204 --> 52:56.305
- You can't.

52:56.340 --> 52:57.139
- Why not?

52:57.174 --> 53:02.077
- Because you need
my fingerprint.

53:02.213 --> 53:06.148
- Oh my god.

53:06.183 --> 53:08.150
- What do we tell the boss?

53:08.185 --> 53:09.418
- Nothing.

53:09.553 --> 53:10.619
I got a tarp in the car.

53:10.721 --> 53:12.755
We'll wrap her body, we'll
put her in her own car,

53:12.857 --> 53:13.422
and then we'll send
her to a chop shop.

53:13.524 --> 53:16.025
- This is a cop, Rocco!

53:16.060 --> 53:17.292
Someone's gonna ask questions.

53:17.328 --> 53:18.961
- So let them.

53:19.063 --> 53:21.930
No body, no crime.

53:22.066 --> 53:24.099
Oh, get it together, Dominic.

53:24.201 --> 53:25.267
Come on.

53:25.403 --> 53:27.503
Go grab the tarp from my car.

53:27.538 --> 53:31.974
Bring the squad car around back.

53:32.009 --> 53:32.808
(Rocco claps)

53:32.910 --> 53:33.842
Come on, let's go.

53:33.878 --> 53:49.825
Snap out of it, we got
a mess to clean up.

53:56.801 --> 53:57.533
- I can do it.

53:57.568 --> 53:59.501
- Yes, you can.

53:59.603 --> 54:02.171
- But...

54:02.206 --> 54:03.672
- You're scared.

54:03.774 --> 54:05.874
Me too.

54:05.910 --> 54:10.312
But it's okay to be scared.

54:10.448 --> 54:14.116
- I wish Dad was here.

54:14.151 --> 54:15.851
- Me too, honey.

54:15.953 --> 54:21.523
I wish he was here every
second of every day.

54:21.625 --> 54:24.593
But he was so proud of you.

54:24.628 --> 54:28.864
And how much he
loved you, and...

54:28.899 --> 54:37.539
And he is always here with
you, right here, in your heart.

54:37.641 --> 54:41.376
Can you feel that?

54:41.412 --> 54:45.514
- I don't feel anything.

54:45.649 --> 54:49.351
But you said we have
no choice, right?

54:49.487 --> 54:54.256
- Yes, that's right.

54:54.291 --> 54:58.627
But you're strong
and you're capable,

54:58.662 --> 55:02.931
and you can do this.

55:02.967 --> 55:03.899
Okay?

55:04.001 --> 55:06.869
- Okay.

55:07.004 --> 55:08.770
- Okay, let's go over
it one more time.

55:08.806 --> 55:09.771
You're gonna go to your room,

55:09.807 --> 55:11.473
you're gonna get your
phone outta the safe,

55:11.509 --> 55:12.908
and you're gonna
come back to me.

55:13.010 --> 55:13.809
Okay?

55:13.844 --> 55:14.610
- Okay.

55:14.645 --> 55:15.310
- No.

55:15.346 --> 55:16.445
Repeat it back to me, please.

55:16.480 --> 55:20.749
- Uh, I'm gonna go to my room,

55:20.851 --> 55:24.887
I'm gonna go to
get my phone, and-

55:24.989 --> 55:28.490
- Ian, look at me. Please.

55:28.526 --> 55:30.092
- Okay, I'm gonna go to my room,

55:30.194 --> 55:32.294
gonna get my phone,
and come back.

55:32.329 --> 55:33.095
- To me.

55:33.197 --> 55:34.129
- To me.

55:34.165 --> 55:35.297
- Yes.

55:35.332 --> 55:35.998
Okay.

55:36.033 --> 55:37.399
I'm gonna keep my eye on them,

55:37.535 --> 55:40.302
and you're gonna get back
here as fast as you can.

55:40.337 --> 55:41.136
Fast.

55:41.172 --> 55:49.978
Okay?
- Okay.

55:50.014 --> 55:50.946
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

55:51.048 --> 55:56.885
Wait, wait, wait.

55:56.921 --> 56:12.868
(dramatic music)

56:50.741 --> 56:52.441
Ian!

56:52.476 --> 56:53.208
You can do...

56:53.244 --> 56:54.076
What are you doing?

56:54.111 --> 56:55.978
Honey, you can clean up later.

56:56.080 --> 57:00.282
Get the phone and
come back to me.

57:00.317 --> 57:05.587
(tense music)

57:05.623 --> 57:08.357
- Ugh.

57:08.459 --> 57:09.358
- Hey.

57:09.393 --> 57:10.859
It was either us or her.

57:10.961 --> 57:11.860
Capisce?

57:11.895 --> 57:18.900
(tense music)

57:18.936 --> 57:20.269
- What?

57:20.304 --> 57:21.737
Come on.

57:21.772 --> 57:28.710
(tense music)

57:28.812 --> 57:35.784
- Okay.

57:35.819 --> 57:40.088
No, no, no.

57:40.124 --> 57:41.356
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

57:41.458 --> 57:42.324
No, no, no, no!

57:42.359 --> 57:43.725
(ball rattles)

57:43.761 --> 57:45.694
No, no, no!

57:45.796 --> 57:47.195
- What was that?

57:47.298 --> 57:47.829
- They're out.

57:51.318 --> 58:02.728
(dramatic music)

58:02.763 --> 58:04.396
- We gotta go, okay?
- Wait, wait.

58:04.431 --> 58:06.198
- Right now!
- Wait, wait, wait.

58:06.233 --> 58:08.367
Wait, wait.

58:08.469 --> 58:10.869
- [Leila] We have
to go, right now.

58:10.904 --> 58:25.150
(tense music)

58:25.185 --> 58:26.785
- False alarm!

58:26.820 --> 58:31.089
I'm gonna go check her bedroom.

58:31.125 --> 58:33.358
(footsteps leaving)

58:33.460 --> 58:49.408
(dramatic music)

59:05.025 --> 59:12.264
Gotcha.

59:12.366 --> 59:14.132
Come on!

59:14.168 --> 59:14.566
(grunting)

59:14.601 --> 59:16.601
- Get off me!

59:16.637 --> 59:20.939
(dramatic music)

59:21.041 --> 59:21.573
(Leila screams)

59:21.675 --> 59:23.341
- [Ian] Mom, it hurts!

59:23.377 --> 59:26.478
- Oh my god. Baby.

59:26.513 --> 59:27.312
It's okay.

59:27.347 --> 59:28.480
- [Ian] It hurts!

59:28.515 --> 59:30.248
- I'm gonna kill you, you bitch!

59:30.350 --> 59:34.186
And your son too.

59:34.221 --> 59:35.253
- Here.

59:35.355 --> 59:37.355
Oh my god, okay.

59:37.391 --> 59:39.424
(Ian grunts)

59:39.526 --> 59:40.292
- I'm gonna get you guys.

59:40.394 --> 59:42.427
I'm gonna get you.

59:42.529 --> 59:45.530
(Rocco groans)

59:45.566 --> 59:50.368
(Ian grunts)

59:50.404 --> 59:54.473
- Just gonna...

59:54.508 --> 59:57.676
(Rocco groans)

59:57.711 --> 1:00:00.378
- Oh, god.

1:00:00.414 --> 1:00:01.880
- It's gonna sting
just a little bit.

1:00:01.915 --> 1:00:06.184
(Ian groans)

1:00:06.220 --> 1:00:08.487
(Rocco exhales)

1:00:08.589 --> 1:00:14.159
- I'm coming back for you.

1:00:14.194 --> 1:00:16.027
- Here you go.

1:00:16.063 --> 1:00:18.063
Just gonna protect it, okay?

1:00:18.098 --> 1:00:19.531
It's okay, I got it, I got it.

1:00:19.566 --> 1:00:20.465
I'm so sorry, baby.

1:00:20.501 --> 1:00:25.670
I should've never let
you go over there.

1:00:25.706 --> 1:00:31.710
- I got it.

1:00:31.745 --> 1:00:33.979
- Thank you, baby.

1:00:34.081 --> 1:00:35.380
Okay. Come on.

1:00:35.415 --> 1:00:36.381
Come on.

1:00:36.416 --> 1:00:38.183
Come on!

1:00:38.285 --> 1:00:40.819
- [Ian] Try again.

1:00:40.954 --> 1:00:41.853
Keep trying.

1:00:41.955 --> 1:00:42.521
- Okay.

1:00:42.556 --> 1:00:45.390
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:00:45.425 --> 1:00:47.926
- Mom. Try a text.

1:00:47.961 --> 1:00:49.427
- I can't text
the police, honey.

1:00:49.463 --> 1:00:50.428
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:00:50.464 --> 1:00:52.230
There is one person I can try.

1:00:52.266 --> 1:00:54.099
Okay.

1:00:54.134 --> 1:00:54.833
Oh...

1:00:54.868 --> 1:00:57.903
Please, please, please, please.

1:00:57.938 --> 1:01:00.238
Oh, no service.

1:01:00.274 --> 1:01:01.506
Ugh!

1:01:01.608 --> 1:01:04.943
(Rocco grunts)

1:01:04.978 --> 1:01:05.744
- What happened? What happened?

1:01:05.779 --> 1:01:06.478
What happened?

1:01:06.513 --> 1:01:07.345
- I think she got a cell phone.

1:01:07.447 --> 1:01:08.413
- No!

1:01:08.448 --> 1:01:09.915
No, she's gonna call the cops!

1:01:09.950 --> 1:01:12.417
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:01:12.452 --> 1:01:14.085
- It is a safe room.

1:01:14.121 --> 1:01:16.288
Don't be an idiot,
there's no cell signal.

1:01:16.323 --> 1:01:17.956
- I mean, are you willing
to take that chance?

1:01:17.991 --> 1:01:18.757
Come on, let's go.

1:01:18.792 --> 1:01:20.559
Let's go, let's go.

1:01:20.661 --> 1:01:24.196
- Not until we get
what we came for.

1:01:24.331 --> 1:01:25.597
I'm calling the boss.

1:01:25.632 --> 1:01:29.201
You keep an eye on her.

1:01:29.303 --> 1:01:38.276
Idiot.

1:01:38.312 --> 1:01:40.345
- Come on.

1:01:40.380 --> 1:01:41.112
(Leila gasps)

1:01:41.148 --> 1:01:41.846
Oh, god!

1:01:41.882 --> 1:01:42.581
It went through,
it went through.

1:01:42.683 --> 1:01:43.348
Okay.

1:01:43.517 --> 1:01:46.117
So Neil will call the police,

1:01:46.153 --> 1:01:47.419
and they'll come save us.

1:01:47.521 --> 1:01:49.221
- Neil?

1:01:49.356 --> 1:01:50.188
- Yes, Neil.

1:01:50.224 --> 1:01:52.424
He's the friendly
neighbor that I met.

1:01:52.526 --> 1:01:53.491
He'll...

1:01:53.527 --> 1:01:54.993
(Ian grunts)

1:01:55.028 --> 1:01:56.661
- I feel dizzy, Mom.

1:01:56.697 --> 1:01:57.495
- It's okay, sweetie.

1:01:57.531 --> 1:01:59.297
It's okay, honey.

1:01:59.333 --> 1:02:01.299
We're gonna get through
this, I promise you.

1:02:01.335 --> 1:02:03.969
I promise you we're gonna get
through this. Okay, buddy?

1:02:04.004 --> 1:02:07.138
Listen to me.

1:02:07.174 --> 1:02:08.807
It's gonna be okay.

1:02:08.842 --> 1:02:09.808
It's gonna be okay.

1:02:09.843 --> 1:02:13.245
We just got to hold on
a little longer. Okay?

1:02:13.347 --> 1:02:14.412
Okay?

1:02:14.514 --> 1:02:17.782
Just a little bit longer.

1:02:17.818 --> 1:02:19.084
There's somebody here.

1:02:19.219 --> 1:02:19.884
Oh my god, it's Neil.

1:02:19.920 --> 1:02:21.253
He must've got my message. Neil?

1:02:21.388 --> 1:02:23.021
- I got your message.
Is this a joke?

1:02:23.056 --> 1:02:24.589
- No, no, look!

1:02:24.725 --> 1:02:27.092
We don't have much time.

1:02:27.227 --> 1:02:28.760
There are two
intruders in the house.

1:02:28.895 --> 1:02:29.561
We're in the safe space.

1:02:29.730 --> 1:02:33.164
But you gotta call the police.

1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:34.266
- Well, they're on their way.

1:02:34.401 --> 1:02:35.767
Are you okay? Where's your son?

1:02:35.869 --> 1:02:38.970
- He's here. We're
scared, but we're alive.

1:02:39.072 --> 1:02:40.171
Look, there's not much time.

1:02:40.207 --> 1:02:41.473
They've already
killed two people.

1:02:41.575 --> 1:02:43.441
- Oh, okay, okay.

1:02:43.543 --> 1:02:45.844
How...

1:02:45.879 --> 1:02:48.546
Look, Leila, how do I get in?

1:02:48.582 --> 1:02:50.715
- Look, listen to me.

1:02:50.751 --> 1:02:52.851
You have to go away now.

1:02:52.886 --> 1:02:54.552
These people are dangerous.

1:02:54.588 --> 1:02:56.521
- Well, me too.

1:02:56.556 --> 1:02:58.456
How do I get in, Leila?

1:02:58.558 --> 1:02:59.924
- The garage.

1:02:59.960 --> 1:03:01.059
It's not locked.

1:03:01.094 --> 1:03:02.827
- Okay.

1:03:02.863 --> 1:03:04.195
Hang in there, all right?

1:03:04.231 --> 1:03:06.464
I'm coming for you.

1:03:06.566 --> 1:03:06.931
- Hurry.

1:03:14.875 --> 1:03:24.683
(grunting)

1:03:24.718 --> 1:03:26.651
- Oh my god.

1:03:26.687 --> 1:03:29.454
- [Woman] What
are you two up to?

1:03:29.489 --> 1:03:31.856
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:03:31.892 --> 1:03:35.293
(trunk slams)
Oh, what a beautiful dog.

1:03:35.395 --> 1:03:36.294
- She is. Isn't she?

1:03:36.396 --> 1:03:37.295
- Yeah!

1:03:37.397 --> 1:03:38.630
- Won blue ribbons
three years in a row.

1:03:38.732 --> 1:03:40.765
- How about that? Boy,
she's special, huh?

1:03:40.867 --> 1:03:42.534
(woman laughs)

1:03:42.569 --> 1:03:44.169
- Better than any
husband I ever had.

1:03:44.204 --> 1:03:45.637
(laughing)

1:03:45.672 --> 1:03:47.706
So, who are you?

1:03:47.741 --> 1:03:49.874
Because I've never seen
you around here before.

1:03:49.910 --> 1:03:51.643
- Oh, we're just helping
out the lady of the house

1:03:51.745 --> 1:03:52.010
with some repairs.

1:03:52.045 --> 1:03:53.945
- Oh.

1:03:54.081 --> 1:03:55.880
Her husband just died.

1:03:55.916 --> 1:03:56.981
Poor woman.

1:03:57.017 --> 1:04:00.018
And you know, she has a son,
and he has troubles too.

1:04:00.053 --> 1:04:01.953
She is so dedicated to him.

1:04:02.055 --> 1:04:02.787
I've seen her with him.

1:04:02.889 --> 1:04:04.155
- Yeah, she really is.
- Yeah.

1:04:04.257 --> 1:04:04.823
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she is.

1:04:04.925 --> 1:04:05.924
And I tell you one thing,

1:04:05.959 --> 1:04:09.394
I am glad that this house
is getting a facelift

1:04:09.429 --> 1:04:11.029
after all these years.
(woman laughs)

1:04:11.064 --> 1:04:12.997
- Well, we'll do
the best we can.

1:04:13.033 --> 1:04:13.798
- Yeah, well that's good.

1:04:13.900 --> 1:04:14.599
All right then.

1:04:14.634 --> 1:04:15.500
- You have a good night, ma'am.

1:04:15.535 --> 1:04:16.868
- You too, you too, you too.
- We will.

1:04:16.903 --> 1:04:18.136
- Goodnight.
- Buh-bye.

1:04:18.271 --> 1:04:21.606
- [Woman] Come on, baby.

1:04:21.641 --> 1:04:25.176
- [Rocco] You're always
so friendly with everyone.

1:04:25.278 --> 1:04:27.145
- Are you gonna shoot a lady
and her dog in the street?

1:04:27.247 --> 1:04:39.290
Come on.

1:04:39.326 --> 1:04:46.564
(garage closes)

1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:49.868
- We're gonna be okay.

1:04:49.970 --> 1:04:54.072
You were so brave.

1:04:54.107 --> 1:04:58.877
- If I'm brave, does
that mean I'm normal?

1:04:58.979 --> 1:05:02.747
- Being brave is
extraordinary, Ian.

1:05:02.783 --> 1:05:03.815
It's way bigger than normal.

1:05:03.850 --> 1:05:08.052
It's not just what
you did tonight.

1:05:08.155 --> 1:05:12.190
It is also standing
up for yourself.

1:05:12.292 --> 1:05:15.994
Hey, for having the courage
to fight for who you are,

1:05:16.029 --> 1:05:20.064
no matter what people say.

1:05:20.167 --> 1:05:22.934
You don't want to
be normal, Ian.

1:05:22.969 --> 1:05:33.878
Please don't be normal,
because you are so much more.

1:05:34.014 --> 1:05:37.816
- But I want to help.

1:05:37.851 --> 1:05:40.985
- You saved our lives.

1:05:41.021 --> 1:05:43.321
Do you understand?

1:05:43.356 --> 1:05:45.790
And don't you ever forget that.

1:05:45.826 --> 1:05:50.628
And don't you ever
change who you are

1:05:50.664 --> 1:05:52.931
to make someone else
feel comfortable.

1:05:53.033 --> 1:05:54.799
Got it?

1:05:54.835 --> 1:05:58.636
Normal is boring.

1:05:58.672 --> 1:05:59.170
Say it.

1:05:59.339 --> 1:06:02.140
- Normal is boring.

1:06:02.175 --> 1:06:02.907
- Normal is stupid.

1:06:03.009 --> 1:06:04.676
(Ian chuckles)

1:06:04.711 --> 1:06:07.846
- Normal is stupid.

1:06:07.881 --> 1:06:10.849
- I am extraordinary.

1:06:10.884 --> 1:06:12.917
- I am extraordinary.

1:06:13.019 --> 1:06:16.120
(tense music)

1:06:16.223 --> 1:06:17.288
- Hey.

1:06:17.390 --> 1:06:19.991
Someone's coming.

1:06:20.093 --> 1:06:20.992
Neil, is that you?

1:06:21.094 --> 1:06:23.695
- [Rocco] Sorry to disappoint.

1:06:23.730 --> 1:06:24.229
- Leila?
- Oh my god, what did you do?

1:06:24.397 --> 1:06:26.164
- Leila, I'm sorry.

1:06:26.266 --> 1:06:29.033
I should've listened to you.

1:06:29.069 --> 1:06:30.702
- Ian, put on your headphones.

1:06:30.737 --> 1:06:32.537
Put them on now.

1:06:32.572 --> 1:06:33.505
Did they hurt you?

1:06:33.607 --> 1:06:34.672
- That can change any second

1:06:34.774 --> 1:06:36.007
unless you start
doing as you're told.

1:06:36.109 --> 1:06:37.175
- The police are on their way.

1:06:37.277 --> 1:06:38.042
- Tell them, Neil.

1:06:38.078 --> 1:06:40.879
Listen, I will
end your boyfriend

1:06:40.914 --> 1:06:42.780
if you don't come
outta this room now!

1:06:42.816 --> 1:06:43.648
- Leila?

1:06:43.683 --> 1:06:44.549
- [Leila] Well, he's
not my boyfriend.

1:06:44.784 --> 1:06:45.817
He didn't have anything
to do with this.

1:06:45.919 --> 1:06:46.317
- Leila, listen,

1:06:46.419 --> 1:06:47.886
- Let him go.

1:06:47.921 --> 1:06:49.554
- All they want is
to talk to you, okay?

1:06:49.589 --> 1:06:53.057
To make sure that your
son doesn't say anything

1:06:53.093 --> 1:06:54.125
about whatever he saw.

1:06:54.160 --> 1:06:55.894
- They're lying.

1:06:55.929 --> 1:06:57.462
- We just want to get out of
here before the cop shows up.

1:06:57.497 --> 1:06:58.229
- Shut up, Dom!

1:06:58.265 --> 1:06:59.464
- Don't use my name!

1:06:59.499 --> 1:07:00.465
- Okay, stupid.

1:07:00.634 --> 1:07:01.833
- They're gonna hurt
me unless you come out.

1:07:01.935 --> 1:07:02.867
- I'm so sorry.

1:07:02.969 --> 1:07:03.501
- Enough talking!

1:07:03.603 --> 1:07:04.269
- No, no, no, no, no!

1:07:04.304 --> 1:07:06.838
Leila, they're gonna kill me!

1:07:06.940 --> 1:07:11.209
They're gonna kill me
like your neighbor.

1:07:11.311 --> 1:07:12.977
(Neil sobs)

1:07:13.013 --> 1:07:14.112
- How did you know it was
my neighbor who was killed?

1:07:14.147 --> 1:07:16.047
- Please, Leila, please.

1:07:16.149 --> 1:07:18.616
- I never told you
it was my neighbor.

1:07:18.652 --> 1:07:19.417
(Neil sobs)

1:07:19.452 --> 1:07:22.453
Who are you?

1:07:22.489 --> 1:07:25.156
(Neil laughs)

1:07:25.191 --> 1:07:31.129
(tense music)

1:07:31.164 --> 1:07:34.499
- Leila, open the door.

1:07:34.534 --> 1:07:43.908
(tense music)

1:07:44.010 --> 1:07:45.143
- Ian.

1:07:45.178 --> 1:07:50.214
The videos you made, are
they synced to your phone?

1:07:50.317 --> 1:07:52.584
Ian.

1:07:52.686 --> 1:07:56.721
The videos that you made, are
they synced to your phone?

1:07:56.823 --> 1:07:59.857
- They save automatically.

1:07:59.893 --> 1:08:15.840
(dramatic music)

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:43.301
- Look, everything's
gonna be fine.

1:08:43.436 --> 1:08:46.371
Just come out and we'll talk.

1:08:46.406 --> 1:08:50.375
- You lied about everything.

1:08:50.410 --> 1:08:52.176
You're a murderer.

1:08:52.278 --> 1:08:54.479
- Liar, yes, murderer, no.

1:08:54.614 --> 1:08:56.481
All we did was rob a place
that was covered by insurance.

1:08:56.616 --> 1:08:59.217
- And you killed her.

1:08:59.252 --> 1:09:02.820
- Yeah. That, I admit, was bad.

1:09:02.956 --> 1:09:04.322
- And when we met, you
were casing my house.

1:09:04.457 --> 1:09:05.523
Weren't you?

1:09:05.558 --> 1:09:07.358
- Okay, look.

1:09:07.394 --> 1:09:08.393
Nobody else is gonna
get hurt, all right?

1:09:08.428 --> 1:09:10.395
But you must do what we say.

1:09:10.430 --> 1:09:13.698
- You go to hell.

1:09:13.733 --> 1:09:14.666
I'm not going anywhere.

1:09:14.734 --> 1:09:18.670
- No...
(hand slams)

1:09:18.805 --> 1:09:21.105
You all really
screwed this one up.

1:09:21.141 --> 1:09:21.673
- How could we have
known that they had

1:09:21.708 --> 1:09:23.675
Fort Knox up in here?

1:09:23.743 --> 1:09:25.343
- How does this end? Huh?

1:09:25.478 --> 1:09:29.580
I mean, with four dead
bodies, including a cop?

1:09:29.616 --> 1:09:30.815
We're going away
for a long time.

1:09:30.917 --> 1:09:31.783
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. A cop?

1:09:31.818 --> 1:09:33.117
What cop?

1:09:33.153 --> 1:09:36.421
- A cop showed up to the
front door and Rocco shot her.

1:09:36.456 --> 1:09:37.622
Shot her, she's dead.

1:09:37.657 --> 1:09:38.923
See, she kept her gun too.

1:09:38.958 --> 1:09:39.624
- And I'm not afraid to use it.

1:09:39.826 --> 1:09:43.428
- Hey, hey, hey, give me that.

1:09:43.463 --> 1:09:45.129
Are you outta your mind?

1:09:45.165 --> 1:09:46.764
- You sent me here to
make the tough calls,

1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:47.465
and that is exactly what I did.

1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:49.233
To protect us.

1:09:49.269 --> 1:09:52.370
- Somebody's gonna come
looking for this cop.

1:09:52.505 --> 1:09:53.337
Where is he?

1:09:53.373 --> 1:09:55.973
- She's in the trunk
of her squad car.

1:09:56.009 --> 1:09:58.109
Oh, god. I am so screwed.

1:09:58.144 --> 1:09:58.710
God, I'm screwed. I'm
screwed, I'm screwed.

1:09:58.745 --> 1:10:00.545
- Oh, calm down, Dominic.

1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:02.814
This is not helping.

1:10:02.849 --> 1:10:03.915
- Hey, you know
what's not helping?

1:10:03.950 --> 1:10:07.118
Is you talking about killing
a mother and her son!

1:10:07.153 --> 1:10:07.485
That's what's not helping.

1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:10.888
Hey, boss?

1:10:11.024 --> 1:10:14.325
Look, I'm not in it for
killing people. Okay?

1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:16.127
You know, I'm fine if you
want to rob rich people,

1:10:16.162 --> 1:10:16.661
get in, get the money, get out.

1:10:16.863 --> 1:10:18.429
That's fine with me.

1:10:18.465 --> 1:10:19.397
All right?

1:10:19.432 --> 1:10:21.632
But then that lady saw
and she killed her.

1:10:21.668 --> 1:10:24.769
She killed her, and a
kid saw it. And a cop!

1:10:24.804 --> 1:10:26.471
A cop is dead and there's
blood all over the ground,

1:10:26.506 --> 1:10:28.406
there's blood on the ground,
there's blood on my hands.

1:10:28.541 --> 1:10:29.474
Boss, there's blood on my hands,

1:10:29.509 --> 1:10:31.609
and I'm not going
to prison, okay?

1:10:31.644 --> 1:10:34.512
I'm not going to prison!

1:10:34.547 --> 1:10:35.513
(tense music)

1:10:35.548 --> 1:10:39.650
You know what?

1:10:39.686 --> 1:10:41.853
I'm done.

1:10:41.888 --> 1:10:44.522
I'm gonna go. Okay?

1:10:44.557 --> 1:10:50.995
Sorry.

1:10:51.030 --> 1:10:55.133
(gunshots booming)

1:10:55.168 --> 1:10:59.437
- Oh my god.

1:10:59.572 --> 1:11:03.608
- Put him in the
trunk with the cop.

1:11:03.743 --> 1:11:08.846
I'm about done playing
games with these two.

1:11:08.882 --> 1:11:09.447
(Leila sobs)

1:11:09.482 --> 1:11:11.716
- These people are crazy!

1:11:11.751 --> 1:11:17.789
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

1:11:17.924 --> 1:11:19.690
What's wrong with you people?

1:11:19.726 --> 1:11:23.694
- Hey.

1:11:23.730 --> 1:11:25.863
- I didn't know, baby.

1:11:25.899 --> 1:11:27.498
I don't know.
- Mom, Mom, Mom.

1:11:27.534 --> 1:11:29.000
- I don't know what's happening!

1:11:29.035 --> 1:11:30.301
- Hey, Mom, it's okay.

1:11:30.436 --> 1:11:31.068
Come here.

1:11:31.104 --> 1:11:33.504
- Why are you attacking us?

1:11:33.540 --> 1:11:36.140
We don't have anything!

1:11:36.276 --> 1:11:36.808
- Hey, Mom. Come here.

1:11:36.876 --> 1:11:39.310
It's okay, it's okay.

1:11:39.445 --> 1:11:42.647
It's okay. Come here.

1:11:42.782 --> 1:11:43.881
It's okay, come on.

1:11:43.917 --> 1:11:49.620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1:11:49.722 --> 1:11:50.888
Come on.

1:11:50.924 --> 1:12:03.434
- 1, 2...
- 3, 4, 5, 6.

1:12:03.469 --> 1:12:08.072
Neil isn't gonna help us, is he?

1:12:08.107 --> 1:12:10.274
- No, baby.

1:12:10.310 --> 1:12:15.346
Neil's not gonna help us.

1:12:15.481 --> 1:12:17.515
(rattling)
(tense music)

1:12:17.650 --> 1:12:18.416
What's that sound?

1:12:18.451 --> 1:12:20.618
- I think someone
shut the air off.

1:12:20.653 --> 1:12:21.886
- What?

1:12:21.921 --> 1:12:24.255
- Any minute now
you'll run out of air.

1:12:24.290 --> 1:12:27.625
You and your son will die.

1:12:27.660 --> 1:12:28.593
- Oh, what are
you talking about?

1:12:28.761 --> 1:12:31.963
- Well, these rooms
are built like safes.

1:12:31.998 --> 1:12:33.097
They're sealed in.

1:12:33.132 --> 1:12:35.233
There's only one way
oxygen can come in

1:12:35.268 --> 1:12:37.902
and carbon dioxides come out.

1:12:37.937 --> 1:12:39.704
(tense music)

1:12:39.772 --> 1:12:42.573
- Okay. Here.

1:12:42.609 --> 1:12:50.047
(Ian grunts)

1:12:50.183 --> 1:12:51.449
Neil, listen to me.

1:12:51.484 --> 1:12:53.484
He's just a kid.

1:12:53.519 --> 1:12:55.720
- Well, you had your chances.

1:12:55.855 --> 1:12:56.554
We're way past that now.

1:12:56.623 --> 1:12:59.090
You just made me
kill my own guy.

1:12:59.125 --> 1:13:01.225
Tried to walk away,
he knew too much.

1:13:01.294 --> 1:13:01.959
Just like you.

1:13:01.995 --> 1:13:03.995
I can't let that happen.

1:13:04.030 --> 1:13:07.632
But you know, for your
son, it's too bad.

1:13:07.667 --> 1:13:09.600
- This is not necessary.

1:13:09.636 --> 1:13:10.735
I am not gonna go to the police.

1:13:10.870 --> 1:13:15.106
I can't identify any of you.

1:13:15.141 --> 1:13:18.276
And even if I did,
you know where I live!

1:13:18.311 --> 1:13:19.810
- [Neil] You made your choice.

1:13:19.846 --> 1:13:22.480
- No, I did not!

1:13:22.515 --> 1:13:23.514
He's a kid!

1:13:23.549 --> 1:13:31.322
Please!

1:13:31.357 --> 1:13:35.293
Please.

1:13:35.395 --> 1:13:37.061
(Leila exhales)

1:13:39.866 --> 1:13:40.898
It's okay.

1:13:40.934 --> 1:13:43.267
- Mom.
- I need to think.

1:13:43.303 --> 1:13:46.170
Look, I need to think.

1:13:46.306 --> 1:13:47.238
- Are we gonna die?

1:13:47.273 --> 1:13:49.674
- No, we're not gonna die, baby.

1:13:49.809 --> 1:13:52.610
We're not gonna die.

1:13:52.645 --> 1:13:55.880
Somebody please help us!

1:13:55.982 --> 1:13:58.883
Please!

1:13:58.985 --> 1:14:02.086
- [Rocco] We disconnected
the outside speaker.

1:14:02.121 --> 1:14:08.092
Nobody can hear you.

1:14:08.127 --> 1:14:10.728
- Ian.

1:14:10.763 --> 1:14:13.698
Listen to me.

1:14:13.800 --> 1:14:14.999
Listen, honey.

1:14:15.034 --> 1:14:17.401
Just try to think of
something, anything.

1:14:17.437 --> 1:14:19.437
Anything that you can think of.

1:14:19.472 --> 1:14:23.374
Please, baby.

1:14:23.476 --> 1:14:26.243
- [Ian] I have an idea.

1:14:26.279 --> 1:14:31.983
(tense music)

1:14:32.018 --> 1:14:37.421
(sink runs)

1:14:37.457 --> 1:14:39.757
- She's up to something.

1:14:39.792 --> 1:14:54.672
(dramatic music)

1:14:54.707 --> 1:15:02.013
- Go check it out.

1:15:02.048 --> 1:15:14.859
(electricity sparks)

1:15:14.894 --> 1:15:16.293
- No!

1:15:16.329 --> 1:15:17.261
What the hell was that?

1:15:17.296 --> 1:15:21.665
- I don't know. But
this wasn't an accident.

1:15:21.701 --> 1:15:23.267
- What's that?
- They're out of the room.

1:15:23.369 --> 1:15:25.336
Let's end this.

1:15:25.371 --> 1:15:26.871
- ...., what now?

1:15:26.906 --> 1:15:27.805
- Let's split up and find them.

1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:30.107
They're not gonna
leave this house alive.

1:15:30.243 --> 1:15:30.875
You hear me?

1:15:30.910 --> 1:15:31.275
- Okay.

1:15:31.310 --> 1:15:34.779
(Ian coughs)

1:15:34.914 --> 1:15:36.347
- Okay. You did good.

1:15:36.382 --> 1:15:37.782
(Ian coughs)
Hey, shh, shh.

1:15:37.917 --> 1:15:41.118
We gotta keep moving.

1:15:41.220 --> 1:15:43.421
We gotta hide.

1:15:43.456 --> 1:15:59.403
(tense music)

1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:08.245
- Leila?

1:16:08.281 --> 1:16:12.650
Let's not make this
harder than it has to be.

1:16:12.785 --> 1:16:14.852
Look, if you come
out, I promise you,

1:16:14.887 --> 1:16:18.823
Ian will have a life.

1:16:18.958 --> 1:16:31.902
You hear me?

1:16:31.938 --> 1:16:33.037
- [Dad] Hey, superstar.

1:16:33.072 --> 1:16:34.038
Where are you?

1:16:34.073 --> 1:16:37.741
Ian?

1:16:37.777 --> 1:16:40.845
Are you sitting in
the safe space again?

1:16:40.947 --> 1:16:46.851
Hello?

1:16:46.986 --> 1:16:47.852
Well, hey.

1:16:47.954 --> 1:16:48.953
You remember when we
were talking about

1:16:48.988 --> 1:16:49.787
courage and strength,

1:16:49.989 --> 1:16:52.890
how sometimes it's
hard to be brave?

1:16:52.992 --> 1:16:55.759
Well, here's the trick, Ian.

1:16:55.795 --> 1:16:58.062
Just be yourself.

1:16:58.164 --> 1:17:00.264
You are strong like a lion,

1:17:00.299 --> 1:17:02.900
and kind like your mom.

1:17:02.935 --> 1:17:06.070
And you're funny like me.

1:17:06.172 --> 1:17:08.139
(gunshots booming)

1:17:08.174 --> 1:17:09.773
So what I'm saying is,

1:17:09.809 --> 1:17:11.909
being yourself
means you're brave.

1:17:12.011 --> 1:17:12.510
It's that simple.

1:17:12.545 --> 1:17:12.977
- [Neil] Oh my god.

1:17:13.012 --> 1:17:14.912
Leila!

1:17:15.014 --> 1:17:17.148
- Go, go!

1:17:17.183 --> 1:17:18.149
(Neil yells)

1:17:18.184 --> 1:17:19.650
- Damn it!

1:17:19.685 --> 1:17:30.728
(suspenseful music)

1:17:30.863 --> 1:17:36.934
- Let's get out of here.

1:17:36.969 --> 1:17:42.840
- He's there.

1:17:42.875 --> 1:17:44.175
(Leila gasps)
- Please, please, please!

1:17:44.210 --> 1:17:45.609
- Don't even think about it.

1:17:45.645 --> 1:17:46.577
One move and he's dead.

1:17:46.679 --> 1:17:47.811
- 1, 2, 3, 4-

1:17:47.847 --> 1:17:48.345
- [Leila] Please don't hurt him.

1:17:48.514 --> 1:17:50.481
- 5, 6.
- Please!

1:17:50.516 --> 1:17:51.849
- You made my life
a living hell.

1:17:51.884 --> 1:17:54.618
All I wanted was to rob
a couple of rich folks

1:17:54.720 --> 1:17:55.653
who could afford it anyway.

1:17:55.688 --> 1:17:57.121
But no, you and your
son had to mess it up.

1:17:57.223 --> 1:17:59.423
- 5, 6, 1, 2-
- Okay.

1:17:59.559 --> 1:18:02.159
I'll do anything, because he
cannot testify against you.

1:18:02.195 --> 1:18:03.260
- But you can.

1:18:03.362 --> 1:18:04.061
- 6-
- [Neil] Shut up!

1:18:04.096 --> 1:18:05.829
- Please, don't.

1:18:05.865 --> 1:18:06.730
- [Neil] Stop counting!

1:18:06.766 --> 1:18:08.666
- Just shoot me. Don't
hurt him, please.

1:18:08.701 --> 1:18:09.099
- Good idea.

1:18:09.135 --> 1:18:10.868
(Neil groans)

1:18:10.903 --> 1:18:11.802
(Leila yells)

1:18:11.837 --> 1:18:14.071
- [Leila] Let's go!

1:18:14.173 --> 1:18:18.576
(screaming)
(suspenseful music)

1:18:18.678 --> 1:18:19.743
- You're staying with me.

1:18:19.845 --> 1:18:24.148
Come on, come on, come on.

1:18:24.183 --> 1:18:26.350
(Leila grunts)

1:18:26.385 --> 1:18:28.352
- Ian, go!

1:18:28.387 --> 1:18:31.755
Ian, go out the door, baby!

1:18:31.791 --> 1:18:36.527
(tense music)

1:18:36.562 --> 1:18:47.204
(grunting)

1:18:47.240 --> 1:18:53.377
(Neil laughs)

1:18:53.412 --> 1:18:58.682
(Leila groans)

1:18:58.718 --> 1:19:05.055
(Neil groans)

1:19:05.091 --> 1:19:08.058
- You broke my nose.

1:19:08.094 --> 1:19:09.960
Oh...

1:19:09.996 --> 1:19:12.062
Oh!

1:19:12.098 --> 1:19:13.197
Oh, no, you...

1:19:13.232 --> 1:19:17.735
Oh, you messed up now.

1:19:17.770 --> 1:19:20.704
(Neil grunts)

1:19:20.740 --> 1:19:31.548
(tense music)

1:19:31.651 --> 1:19:33.284
You're gonna pay for this.

1:19:33.319 --> 1:19:39.923
(Neil groans)

1:19:39.959 --> 1:19:43.093
Where are you?

1:19:43.195 --> 1:19:59.276
(gunshots booming)

1:20:00.046 --> 1:20:08.052
(sirens blaring)

1:20:08.154 --> 1:20:13.424
- He has a few bruises,
and he's in shock.

1:20:13.526 --> 1:20:14.692
But he'll be okay.

1:20:14.727 --> 1:20:20.030
- Yeah.
- All right?

1:20:20.066 --> 1:20:22.099
(sirens blaring)

1:20:22.201 --> 1:20:24.635
- Hi, buddy.
- Thank you.

1:20:24.670 --> 1:20:27.071
Thank you so much.

1:20:27.173 --> 1:20:30.474
Hey, come here.

1:20:30.509 --> 1:20:31.275
Come here.

1:20:31.310 --> 1:20:34.411
- Did I save us?

1:20:34.513 --> 1:20:36.513
- Yes.

1:20:36.549 --> 1:20:39.083
Yes, you saved us, baby.

1:20:39.185 --> 1:20:44.088
- I love you.

1:20:44.190 --> 1:20:47.424
- I love you too.

1:20:47.526 --> 1:20:51.929
We're safe now.

1:20:52.031 --> 1:21:05.142
We're safe now.

1:21:05.177 --> 1:21:14.151
(tense music)

1:21:14.186 --> 1:21:15.786
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:21:15.921 --> 1:21:17.454
- Good morning, Jake.
- Good morning.

1:21:17.556 --> 1:21:18.155
- Oh.

1:21:18.257 --> 1:21:21.658
Come on, come on!

1:21:21.761 --> 1:21:26.029
- Come on!
- I'm going, I'm going!

1:21:26.065 --> 1:21:27.131
- Oh my gosh!

1:21:27.266 --> 1:21:29.032
- I got in!

1:21:29.068 --> 1:21:30.200
(Leila cheers)!

1:21:30.236 --> 1:21:31.735
Yes, yes, yes!

1:21:31.771 --> 1:21:33.337
- Hey, everybody!
- We got in!

1:21:33.406 --> 1:21:35.172
I got into SpaceX!

1:21:35.274 --> 1:21:36.774
Look, look, look, look, look.
- Let me see!

1:21:36.809 --> 1:21:38.342
- Look, it says right there.
- Oh my god.

1:21:38.377 --> 1:21:40.244
(Leila speaks excitedly)

1:21:40.279 --> 1:21:42.713
- Yes!

1:21:42.748 --> 1:21:45.149
I got in!

1:21:45.284 --> 1:21:46.250
(lighthearted music)
