00:41.447 --> 00:43.722
Good morning, sir.
How about a little breakfast?

00:43.887 --> 00:47.960
How about a dozen grilled winkles
on a bed of curried Rice Crispies?

00:48.127 --> 00:50.516
I'm not eating spicy stuff any more.

00:50.687 --> 00:55.715
Forgive me, sir, but you not eating
spicy food is like a zebra not being stripy

00:55.887 --> 00:59.880
or an old lady not sitting
on a park bench with her legs open.

01:00.047 --> 01:03.244
- May I ask why?
- It makes your breath smell

01:03.407 --> 01:06.797
like a liftful of senile donkeys
returning from a garlic-eating contest.

01:07.007 --> 01:11.364
- That's never bothered you before, sir.
- Well, it bothers me now, OK?

01:11.567 --> 01:15.401
It's because of her, isn't it?
She who must be drooled over.

01:15.607 --> 01:18.075
- You mean Kris?
- Whatever my feelings, sir,

01:18.247 --> 01:22.604
I will not be tempted into making
petty criticisms of fellow crew members.

01:22.767 --> 01:25.201
There is the issue of the salad cream...

01:25.407 --> 01:28.205
- The salad cream?
- I spent months training everyone

01:28.367 --> 01:30.437
to put salad cream in the fridge.

01:30.607 --> 01:33.963
Then she arrives
and it's back in the cupboard!

01:34.167 --> 01:37.762
The first moon we come to, let's dump her!

01:41.007 --> 01:42.998
And what about the extra laundry?

01:43.167 --> 01:46.523
There are all kinds
of extraordinary items turning up -

01:46.687 --> 01:49.281
tights, bras, skimpy vests, little socks.

01:49.447 --> 01:52.041
It's a massive workload. Frank is very upset.

01:52.207 --> 01:55.597
- Frank?
- The washing machine. I named him Frank.

01:55.767 --> 01:59.316
And what about the ironing?
How do you iron a bra?

01:59.487 --> 02:02.160
You take it off first. I spent years practising.

02:02.327 --> 02:06.286
I'd put my nan's bra
around the armchair and unhook it.

02:06.447 --> 02:09.961
Even now,
whenever I see a Parker Knoll, I get horny.

02:11.927 --> 02:14.566
But have you ever ironed a bra, sir?

02:14.767 --> 02:19.761
The only way I've found is to stretch each
container over my head and iron it there.

02:19.927 --> 02:24.318
On a hot cotton setting, it sends
my optical systems into leak overload.

02:24.487 --> 02:26.478
- Cup.
- Sorry, sir?

02:26.647 --> 02:30.925
- Not containers. They're called cups.
- See? I even have to learn new terminology,

02:31.087 --> 02:36.081
special female terminology -
"cups", "potpourri", "depilatory cream".

02:36.247 --> 02:40.240
- Oh! It's never-ending.
- How come you don't know what bras are?

02:40.407 --> 02:44.559
- What about the women on the Nova 5?
- When I cleaned my cache files,

02:44.727 --> 02:46.718
I erased my lingerie database.

02:46.887 --> 02:51.802
I'd only need it if you wanted to go
to a fancy dress party as Hermann GÃ¶ring.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.286
Relax, Kryten.

02:53.447 --> 02:57.235
The scan probe returned
the coordinates of the dimensional tear.

02:57.407 --> 03:00.479
This time tomorrow,
she'll be back in her own dimension.

03:00.647 --> 03:02.763
Well, you're surely not upset, sir?

03:02.927 --> 03:06.237
- If you've got a problem with her, tell her.
- I will!

03:06.407 --> 03:10.002
There's no point whingeing
to me about it, say it to her.

03:10.207 --> 03:13.404
- Hi, guys. How's it going?
- Morning, ma'am! Sleep well?

03:14.367 --> 03:16.244
- Coward.
- Hypocrite.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.318
Not great, actually.

03:19.487 --> 03:23.719
I had this weird dream about a monkey
being stretched across a tennis court.

03:23.887 --> 03:26.162
The noise was just unbearable.

03:26.367 --> 03:29.803
Were you practising
the guitar again last night?

03:32.007 --> 03:36.125
So, what's for breakfast?
Oh, what's this doing in here?

03:37.727 --> 03:40.400
Hold me back! Hold me back!

03:55.287 --> 04:00.441
Don't you see, sir? These deviations from
Space Corps drill put our lives in jeopardy.

04:00.607 --> 04:03.201
She was only drying her tights
on the radiator!

04:03.367 --> 04:07.599
One day it's drying tights,
the next we're spiralling out of control

04:07.767 --> 04:10.122
into the core of a newly-formed sun!

04:12.207 --> 04:14.767
Sorry to interrupt, but we've got problems.

04:14.967 --> 04:17.845
- All the hazard lights are flashing.
- All of them?

04:18.047 --> 04:22.199
On this ship, that means anything from
"we're under attack", to "lunch is burning".

04:22.407 --> 04:23.806
Either way, it's serious.

04:24.007 --> 04:28.444
Getting a reading.
There's something up ahead.

04:28.607 --> 04:31.804
A shiny thing with a long silvery,
glimmery thing behind it.

04:32.007 --> 04:34.646
It's a phasing comet, velocity 25,000mps.

04:34.847 --> 04:36.963
- That's what I said!
- Kryten?

04:37.127 --> 04:42.201
How can I concentrate on a phasing comet
when the salad cream's getting warm?

04:42.407 --> 04:44.602
Heading for tail. Plotting avoidance course.

04:44.807 --> 04:47.275
What's the problem with going through it?

04:47.487 --> 04:50.797
Last time anyone did that,
the forces ripped the ship apart,

04:50.967 --> 04:53.435
turning the crew into potato salad.

04:53.647 --> 04:58.323
Is that the firm delicatessen potato salad
or the squishy, gooey stuff in tins?

04:58.527 --> 05:02.042
- Tins.
- Maybe we should go around.

05:02.247 --> 05:06.684
We'll make it. We're a good crew.
We've been through a few things.

05:06.847 --> 05:09.839
Remember the Vidal Beast of Sharmutt 2?

05:10.047 --> 05:15.201
- The one that nearly killed us?
- No, the other one! We can make it, OK?

05:15.407 --> 05:19.958
- Do you know what a comet is made of?
- Are you suggesting I don't know?

05:20.127 --> 05:23.403
- What?
- You want to know what it's made of?

05:23.567 --> 05:25.683
- Yes.
- He knows what it's made of.

05:25.847 --> 05:28.236
- What?
- Sir, tell her, for goodness sake.

05:28.407 --> 05:30.523
- (MOUTHS)
- So what's it made of?

05:30.687 --> 05:35.044
- I see, I see. Gas. Some kind of gas.
- Some kind of gas?

05:35.207 --> 05:38.563
Yeah, some gas! Dunno what it's called.
Some gassy type of gas.

05:38.767 --> 05:43.841
- It's made of ice.
- Exactly. An icy type of gas. An ice gas.

05:44.047 --> 05:49.201
I hate to interrupt, but this thing
is gonna hit us in about 45 seconds.

05:49.407 --> 05:54.879
I was only trying to save time so you could
get home to your much better Lister.

05:55.087 --> 05:59.000
And I'm trying to prevent us
being scattered like cosmic seasoning!

05:59.207 --> 06:01.880
- Here it comes!
- That wasn't 45 seconds!

06:02.087 --> 06:05.796
Oh, sorry! I was reading the baked potato
timer by mistake!

06:05.967 --> 06:12.315
Will people not leave that here! It makes us
look like we don't know what we're doing!

06:18.647 --> 06:22.196
Lateral trimmers not responding!
Like wrestling in treacle...

06:22.407 --> 06:25.444
Cat says the trimmers
are like wrestling in treacle!

06:25.647 --> 06:30.801
No, I said they were down, then asked
if you like wrestling in... Anyway...

06:31.167 --> 06:34.239
- Damage report, Kryten.
- Auxiliary modulator's short-circuited.

06:34.447 --> 06:38.838
And the chocolate dispenser's ejected
all the snack bars onto the galley floor!

06:41.887 --> 06:47.564
- What's happened to the stabilisers?
- Never mind that! Where's the hair mousse?

06:47.767 --> 06:51.157
- Stabilisers unstable.
- Nuttyfruit bars sliding about!

06:51.367 --> 06:53.483
I'm taking over control!

06:54.087 --> 06:56.078
Hey! What did I tell you?

06:56.247 --> 06:59.683
Come to Daddy, baby! I have control.

06:59.847 --> 07:03.157
It's called a free-fall vacuum.
We're in between vapour streams.

07:03.327 --> 07:05.682
We can ride it across its tail.

07:05.887 --> 07:07.878
(CRASH)

07:08.047 --> 07:09.480
Or maybe not!

07:11.607 --> 07:14.679
If we don't go back,
we'll disintegrate in two minutes!

07:14.847 --> 07:16.838
- Kryten?
- That's a little pessimistic, sir.

07:17.047 --> 07:19.197
I'd say more like three!

07:19.927 --> 07:22.725
You know, I think we should turn around.

07:31.327 --> 07:32.840
Phew!

07:34.207 --> 07:36.198
- Go on. Say it.
- Say what?

07:36.367 --> 07:40.360
- You know what. Say it.
- You really want me to say it?

07:40.527 --> 07:41.926
- Say it.
- All right.

07:42.087 --> 07:46.717
- My Dave would never endanger our crew.
- You had to say it, didn't you?

07:46.887 --> 07:49.765
And stop calling
your boyfriend "Dave"? I'm Dave.

07:49.927 --> 07:54.955
He's just an alternative version of me from
a parallel dimension. He's the anti-Lister.

07:55.127 --> 07:57.687
Well, whoever he is, I won't see him.

07:57.847 --> 08:01.920
By the time we fix this mess,
I'll have missed the linkway!

08:02.087 --> 08:04.920
I could've got through
if the thrusters had worked.

08:05.087 --> 08:08.477
According to the syscomp,
we're carrying too much weight.

08:08.647 --> 08:11.798
It's Miss Kochanski's laundry.
Why will no one listen to me?

08:12.007 --> 08:14.475
Those frilly things
are heavier than they look.

08:14.687 --> 08:18.521
Let's look in the hold
and see what can be jettisoned.

08:18.687 --> 08:22.726
I'll go. I could do
with a breath of musty, fetid air.

08:22.887 --> 08:27.881
Sir, you didn't deliberately damage the ship
so that Miss Kochanski had to stay, did you?

08:28.087 --> 08:31.921
No! 'Course not!
Look, I'm gonna check out the hold.

08:32.087 --> 08:34.078
Rimmer, man, you coming?

08:35.647 --> 08:36.966
Did I say...?

08:38.167 --> 08:41.557
Why did I call you Rimmer?
I called you Rimmer, my God!

08:41.727 --> 08:45.356
Cat! Are you gonna make yourself useful
or preen yourself all day?

08:45.527 --> 08:48.325
- You mean I have a choice?
- Come on.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.955
I can't believe I called you Rimmer.

08:56.167 --> 08:57.566
Yes?

08:59.527 --> 09:05.124
As you may be with us for some time, ma'am,
may I go through some rules of the ship?

09:05.287 --> 09:07.243
- Like what?
- Salad cream.

09:07.407 --> 09:10.479
Salad cream belongs
in the fridge and not in the cupboard.

09:10.687 --> 09:15.124
Two - pants belong in the pants drawer
and socks belong in the socks drawer.

09:15.287 --> 09:20.122
Having discovered a sock in your pants
drawer, this obviously needs restating.

09:20.287 --> 09:22.323
Talking of my clothes,

09:22.487 --> 09:26.196
why do my bras come back
from the laundry shaped like... like...

09:27.727 --> 09:29.046
...your head?

09:29.247 --> 09:32.557
- Three - the toilet seat fiasco...
- I don't want to hear this!

09:32.767 --> 09:36.726
Mr Lister hasn't said anything,
but I can tell he's not happy.

09:36.887 --> 09:41.961
He's not the only one! Do you think I like
flying around in a skip with thrusters?

09:42.167 --> 09:44.806
I don't even enjoy breathing on this ship!

09:44.967 --> 09:49.324
And I'm faced with some neurotic droid
who's obsessed with my pants drawer!

09:49.527 --> 09:51.757
You mean I'm not alone?

09:51.927 --> 09:54.839
Oh, I see. You mean me.

09:55.687 --> 09:58.042
As long as we understand one another!

10:00.487 --> 10:02.796
God! Welcome to hell.

10:03.767 --> 10:07.760
Look. Rimmer's old shoe trees.
He had one for every pair of shoes.

10:08.927 --> 10:13.603
Gave them all names -
Monshoetree, Tueshoetree, Wedshoetree.

10:13.807 --> 10:17.686
- What for?
- So they all had a day in his shoes.

10:17.847 --> 10:21.078
- What a smeg-head.
- He had lots of funny little habits.

10:21.247 --> 10:24.637
- But now I see them for what they were.
- Cretinous.

10:24.847 --> 10:30.843
No. Little human foibles
that made Rimmer special. He was unique.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.277
Yeah, irritating, awkward and unsightly -

10:33.447 --> 10:36.245
the human equivalent of a visible panty line!

10:37.287 --> 10:40.199
Well, we may as well start somewhere.

10:41.127 --> 10:43.766
- These can go!
- You can't throw them out.

10:43.927 --> 10:48.125
They're from when me and Rimmer
played golf on Traga 16. We had fun.

10:48.327 --> 10:51.125
You had fun with Rimmer?

10:52.047 --> 10:56.837
I only had room for a nine-hole course, sir.
It is a very small planetoid.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.925
Taking into consideration
the thinness of atmosphere, sir,

11:00.087 --> 11:03.716
I've made this a 15-mile hole, par three.

11:06.647 --> 11:08.763
Oh, good shot, sir!

11:09.447 --> 11:13.486
(LISTER) Hey, watch this. Watch and weep.

11:18.287 --> 11:21.882
- Oh, smeg!
- Ooh, I... I think it's gone into orbit, sir.

11:25.047 --> 11:29.996
Tough luck, Listy. I'll just pot mine
and you owe me 50 big ones!

11:30.607 --> 11:35.123
Look at him. In the right boots,
he could be marching into Poland.

11:36.367 --> 11:38.198
Hey.

11:39.207 --> 11:42.483
- It's Rimmer's ball.
- It must have gone round the planetoid.

11:42.647 --> 11:46.959
Well, no point bothering him
about it, Krytie. Let's go.

11:49.527 --> 11:53.440
It must be here somewhere.
I've been round the planetoid twice.

11:55.087 --> 11:58.443
No ball, no bet, man. Keep looking.

11:59.407 --> 12:03.195
Memories like that
are just too precious to throw away.

12:05.007 --> 12:07.680
Hello there, sir. How's it going?

12:07.847 --> 12:10.566
We're getting nowhere.
He won't throw anything away

12:10.727 --> 12:13.560
because it reminds him
of good times with Rimmer!

12:13.727 --> 12:18.960
- I must have blinked and missed them.
- You don't know what we used to do,

12:19.127 --> 12:21.083
like the locker room game.

12:21.287 --> 12:26.281
We'd open up lockers of dead crew members
and keep whatever we found.

12:26.447 --> 12:30.406
I don't trust you, Lister.
This game's rigged. You always win.

12:30.567 --> 12:32.762
Last time, you got a gold wristwatch,

12:32.927 --> 12:37.682
and all I got was a box of 100
assorted tampons that glow in the dark.

12:39.367 --> 12:42.325
- Right, well, I'll go first this time.
- OK.

12:43.567 --> 12:47.526
- No, you can go first.
- OK, I'll have 68.

12:47.687 --> 12:49.200
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

12:49.367 --> 12:52.200
- I'll have 68.
- Fine.

12:52.367 --> 12:54.801
Uh... No, you can have it.

12:54.967 --> 12:56.366
Why?

12:56.527 --> 13:00.645
You chose that one because
you think that I think that you're cheating.

13:00.807 --> 13:03.480
So I'll have it, and it'll be useless.

13:03.647 --> 13:06.798
I'm not falling for that one. You have it.

13:06.967 --> 13:08.958
Too smart for me, man.

13:11.047 --> 13:14.084
Hey, a gold necklace...

13:14.247 --> 13:16.363
a bundle of cash...

13:16.527 --> 13:19.883
and - hey! - A nude wrestling video!

13:20.047 --> 13:24.006
"Baked Bean Bombshells Volume 12".

13:24.167 --> 13:26.920
Right, well, I'll have that one.

13:28.407 --> 13:31.205
- Number 58.
- OK.

13:41.327 --> 13:43.318
What the hell was that?

13:44.567 --> 13:46.956
There's a note.

13:47.167 --> 13:50.045
"People who break into lockers
deserve everything they get,

13:50.207 --> 13:53.324
"you cheap double-crossing slimeball."

13:53.527 --> 13:55.597
Sounds like they know you.

13:57.207 --> 14:01.439
See what I mean?
We had fun. It was great. It was fun.

14:03.087 --> 14:06.796
I'll put the rubber room on standby, sir.

14:17.767 --> 14:19.723
About time, Cat.
You're late, man. Where've you been?

14:20.807 --> 14:22.923
Hello, Listy.

14:23.087 --> 14:27.319
Rimmer! Smeggin' hell!
What are you doing here?

14:27.527 --> 14:30.678
I got fed up with adventuring.
You know what it's like,

14:30.847 --> 14:34.476
you save a couple of civilisations,
and it gets a bit... samey.

14:35.807 --> 14:40.403
- I thought I'd find the old team.
- It's good to see you. Are you real?

14:40.607 --> 14:43.519
As real as you can get, being a hologram.

14:47.127 --> 14:50.756
- So... where've you been?
- Argon 5.

14:50.927 --> 14:53.839
I fought in the Belagosian War.
I was decorated...

14:54.007 --> 14:58.922
and used as a Christmas tree in the town
square and fed chocolates all winter.

14:59.127 --> 15:00.685
Really?

15:01.447 --> 15:03.039
No, I'm only kidding.

15:03.247 --> 15:05.317
What do you know about kidding?

15:05.527 --> 15:08.439
I just thought it was time I lightened up.

15:10.127 --> 15:12.083
Hey-hey!

15:13.487 --> 15:17.275
Ahem...
So, er, what about you? How's it going?

15:17.487 --> 15:22.641
Ah, y'know. Same old Starbug.
Same old travelling through space.

15:25.527 --> 15:29.486
I, um... I hear you've got a new crew member?

15:29.687 --> 15:31.678
Yeah, Kochanski.

15:34.247 --> 15:36.238
What's she like?

15:36.407 --> 15:39.126
Oh, she's OK, y'know...

15:40.087 --> 15:42.885
Is she... as good as me?

15:44.127 --> 15:48.200
Well, she's been here a few weeks
and hasn't quoted one Space Corps directive.

15:53.047 --> 15:55.356
She's pretty attractive though, isn't she?

15:55.567 --> 15:59.355
Is she? I hadn't noticed.
She's the type you don't really notice.

15:59.527 --> 16:03.998
You know when you spill soup on your shirt
and you don't notice it? She's like that.

16:04.207 --> 16:08.166
So she's... not as attractive as me, then?

16:08.367 --> 16:12.758
Don't be daft.
She couldn't hold a candle to you, man.

16:12.967 --> 16:15.322
- Nah, you're just saying that.
- I'm not.

16:16.327 --> 16:19.763
I've, um... I missed you, man.

16:21.927 --> 16:24.236
And I've missed you, too, Listy.

16:24.407 --> 16:27.160
- Oh, Arnold, man.
- Dave!

16:27.327 --> 16:30.922
- Don't ever leave us again!
- I won't!

16:31.087 --> 16:33.647
- You promise?
- Oh, Listy!

16:33.807 --> 16:35.206
Oh, Rimsy!

16:38.447 --> 16:39.926
Yaaaaarrrggh!

16:40.087 --> 16:41.884
No! Get off! Get off!

16:45.687 --> 16:50.477
Oh, it was just a dream.
Thank God for that! Just a dream.

16:58.047 --> 17:00.038
(INAUDIBLE)

17:01.047 --> 17:04.960
...and another thing,
she keeps her pants in her sock drawer.

17:05.127 --> 17:08.801
Have you any idea
how long that takes to sort out?

17:08.967 --> 17:11.401
You mean, you've seen her pants?

17:19.166 --> 17:24.116
You're right, Kryten, I must be losing it
or I'd never dream stuff like that.

17:24.287 --> 17:29.042
Kissing Rimmer? I'd rather go bobbing for
apples in a latrine at the Reading Festival!

17:30.447 --> 17:34.281
I'm sure this will help, sir.
I'll just insert my hypnotherapy disc.

17:35.727 --> 17:37.797
Now, just relax.

17:41.567 --> 17:44.240
(SHOUTS IN GERMAN)

17:44.447 --> 17:48.042
- What the hell...?!
- Sorry, sir. Wrong disk.

17:48.247 --> 17:52.126
That was my German language course.
An extract from Hitler's Nuremberg speech.

17:52.327 --> 17:56.923
Hypnotic, but not in the right way.
I'll just find the proper one.

18:04.487 --> 18:07.684
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for something

18:07.847 --> 18:11.317
to erase the memory
of everything I've ever experienced.

18:11.487 --> 18:15.036
A couple of gallons
of medicinal alcohol should do it.

18:15.247 --> 18:19.604
Listen, for what it's worth,
I'm sorry you missed getting back to Dave...

18:19.767 --> 18:21.280
the hologrammatic hunk.

18:21.487 --> 18:25.196
That's OK. I'm sure
you'll have another chance to cock it up.

18:25.407 --> 18:29.798
- I suppose you must be missing him?
- Yeah, I am a bit.

18:30.007 --> 18:36.037
I know what it's like to miss someone -
the way they talk, the way they laugh...

18:36.247 --> 18:38.363
- I know.
- The way their nostrils flare

18:38.527 --> 18:41.963
like two railway tunnels
leading into Snot Street Station.

18:43.167 --> 18:45.158
No... you've lost me there.

18:46.807 --> 18:48.798
So you're missing Rimmer?

18:49.007 --> 18:51.726
I dreamed about him, but he was different,

18:51.887 --> 18:55.675
all smiles and jokes and... and stuff.

18:55.887 --> 18:57.957
I thought you guys didn't get on?

18:58.167 --> 19:01.364
We didn't, that's what's so weird.
He drove me crazy.

19:01.527 --> 19:04.439
The way he ate his food in alphabetical order,

19:04.607 --> 19:09.681
the way he only used three pieces of toilet
paper - one up, one down and one to polish.

19:09.847 --> 19:11.917
- Didn't he have any redeeming features?
- No.

19:12.087 --> 19:15.523
Well, yeah -
sometimes he went out of the room.

19:15.727 --> 19:18.241
How did Rimmer come to be around, anyway?

19:18.447 --> 19:23.521
Well, Holly brought him back to keep me sane,
but he drove me mad!

19:23.727 --> 19:28.118
Now he's gone, maybe you feel guilty
because you realise he was helping you.

19:28.327 --> 19:31.717
If he was helping me,
why didn't he lighten up a bit?

19:31.927 --> 19:34.725
Maybe he sacrificed his happiness
to keep you sane.

19:35.767 --> 19:40.283
But in your dream, he was different,
a carefree, fun-loving Rimmer.

19:40.447 --> 19:44.440
A Rimmer who didn't nag you into helping him
catalogue his cheese collection.

19:45.807 --> 19:49.197
- You're saying I had him all wrong?
- It wasn't your fault.

19:49.367 --> 19:52.165
You had to hate him. It kept you going.

19:52.327 --> 19:54.238
I didn't know.

20:00.247 --> 20:02.044
(PARPS)

20:03.447 --> 20:08.282
You know what I should do? I should throw
everything away and make a new start.

20:13.367 --> 20:15.756
Ah, sorry, Miss Kochanski, ma'am.

20:15.967 --> 20:18.720
This is the medical bay, for sick people only.

20:18.887 --> 20:22.562
Surely you haven't broken out
in a confusingly-filed-pants rash?

20:22.767 --> 20:27.557
Do you know how to extract a warm bottle of
salad cream from a mechanoid's rectal cavity?

20:27.767 --> 20:32.443
- No, but I could research it.
- I'd start right now if I were you.

20:34.407 --> 20:38.605
- OK, sir, now. Just relax.
- It's all right, Kryten.

20:38.767 --> 20:40.883
I talked it through with Kochanski.

20:41.047 --> 20:43.686
- I feel a lot better.
- That takes the biscuit.

20:43.847 --> 20:47.362
I turn my back for five minutes
and she cures you!

20:47.567 --> 20:51.037
- She was only helping.
- It's not the help I mind,

20:51.207 --> 20:53.437
it's the fact that she succeeded.

20:55.447 --> 20:57.438
(PARPS)

21:00.287 --> 21:03.199
OK, guys!
I now declare games night officially open.

21:03.407 --> 21:06.638
Kris can have the honour
of choosing the first game.

21:06.847 --> 21:11.967
And as you're a bit sensitive, no games that
involve dropping trousers and lighting stuff.

21:12.127 --> 21:15.244
That takes care of most of the repertoire!
Where's Kryten?

21:15.407 --> 21:19.082
I dunno, he should be here.
OK, Kris... name your game.

21:19.287 --> 21:22.324
All right! I choose "The Magic Flute"!

21:24.607 --> 21:27.838
- What's that? Sort of musical chairs?
- No, it's an opera.

21:29.887 --> 21:34.324
"The Magic Flute"?
OK, we each hum a section of an aria,

21:34.487 --> 21:36.717
and the others guess
which character is singing.

21:36.927 --> 21:40.158
- That's a game?
- It's more like medieval torture.

21:40.367 --> 21:43.518
No, it's good.
You can throw each other off the scent.

21:43.687 --> 21:49.842
Once, my Dave sang "The Birdcatcher's Song"
in the German translation. It was hilarious!

21:50.007 --> 21:52.441
- We all totally fell about!
- You fell about?

21:52.647 --> 21:55.400
- Yeah!
- Were you going through a meteor storm?

21:57.007 --> 22:01.683
So what games do you play?
Match the body part to the crew member?

22:01.887 --> 22:03.445
I love that one!

22:03.647 --> 22:08.596
Armpit name that tune? Guess whose botty
is sticking through a hole in the curtain?

22:08.807 --> 22:11.958
Shall I add that one to the slate, bud?

22:12.607 --> 22:16.600
Games night is cancelled.
If you'll all follow me to the AR suite,

22:16.767 --> 22:19.235
I have something I think might amuse.

22:28.087 --> 22:29.884
(BLEEPING)

22:30.047 --> 22:33.164
I believe this is the answer
to your dream, sir.

22:33.327 --> 22:37.161
Something slightly more effective
than Miss Kochanski's psychobabble.

22:46.887 --> 22:49.560
It's my museum to Mr Rimmer's memory.

22:49.727 --> 22:53.197
If anyone misses him,
they can relive those great moments.

22:53.367 --> 22:56.677
It's all in there -
the man, the memories, the personality.

22:56.847 --> 22:59.441
- The ego.
- I had to scale that down.

22:59.607 --> 23:04.237
- How did you compile all the exhibits?
- I recreated key events from his diaries.

23:04.407 --> 23:08.195
He kept meticulous records
of life on board ship. Enjoy!

23:19.927 --> 23:22.487
<i>Welcome to The Rimmer Experience,</i>

23:22.687 --> 23:27.044
<i>a place of wonder, excitement and... wonder.</i>

23:27.247 --> 23:29.920
<i>You are about to witness some heroic events</i>

23:30.087 --> 23:33.762
<i>which you may find impossible</i>
<i>to attribute to any living person,</i>

23:33.927 --> 23:37.920
<i>but Arnold J Rimmer</i>
<i>was a deeply remarkable man.</i>

23:41.167 --> 23:43.965
<i>Being the driving force</i>
<i>behind the Red Dwarf mission,</i>

23:44.127 --> 23:47.563
<i>the fearless Rimmer</i>
<i>diced with death on a daily basis.</i>

23:47.727 --> 23:49.206
What?

23:49.407 --> 23:53.719
<i>It needed a strong mind</i>
<i>and cool nerves to hold the crew together.</i>

23:56.527 --> 23:58.597
<i>Asteroid belt up ahead, sir.</i>

23:58.807 --> 24:01.605
<i>No, it isn't, Kryten,</i>
<i>you thick titanium plank.</i>

24:01.767 --> 24:06.158
<i>Those are broken fragments of a dying star</i>
<i>compressed together under enormous pressure,</i>

24:06.327 --> 24:08.557
<i>causing them to compress</i>
<i>into large fragments.</i>

24:08.767 --> 24:12.965
<i>You're right, sir... as usual.</i>
<i>Such an elementary mistake... as usualI</i>

24:13.167 --> 24:17.080
- <i>At times like these, I get really scaredI</i>
- <i>Me tooI</i>

24:18.807 --> 24:21.480
<i>Somebody save us before I wet me keksI</i>

24:21.687 --> 24:24.155
That never happened!
I swear that never happened!

24:26.527 --> 24:29.041
- I feel sick!
- It is a bit bumpy.

24:29.207 --> 24:31.675
It's what I'm seeing that's making me sick!

24:32.567 --> 24:36.480
<i>See, Cat? If you wear the green paisley shirt</i>
<i>with twill trousers,</i>

24:36.647 --> 24:39.366
<i>you can be dignified and fashionable.</i>

24:40.247 --> 24:42.807
Let me at him! I'm gonna kill him!

24:42.967 --> 24:46.198
Twill? What does he think I am?
A woodwork teacher?

24:47.127 --> 24:50.881
<i>Say, Rimmer's a great guy.</i>
<i>What would we do without him?</i>

24:51.047 --> 24:53.197
<i>I owe my life to himI</i>

24:53.407 --> 24:56.797
- Get me out of here!
- Wait. Here comes the best bit.
