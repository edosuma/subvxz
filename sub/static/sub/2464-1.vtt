00:37.500 --> 00:39.160
My name is Turkish.

00:39.460 --> 00:41.537
Funny name for an Englishman, I know.

00:41.796 --> 00:45.248
My parents were on the same plane
when it crashed. That's how they met.

00:46.676 --> 00:48.799
They named me after the plane.

00:49.054 --> 00:51.545
Not many people are
named after a plane crash.

00:52.349 --> 00:53.760
That's Tommy.

00:54.059 --> 00:56.217
He tells people
he was named after a gun.

00:56.770 --> 01:01.479
But I know he was really named after
a famous 19th century ballet dancer.

01:02.026 --> 01:05.644
Known him for as long as I can
remember. He's my partner.

01:05.988 --> 01:08.610
Doesn't mean we hold hands
or take walks.

01:08.908 --> 01:13.202
It means I try to keep him out of
as much trouble as he inflicts on me.

01:13.454 --> 01:16.325
I give him a hard time.
Keeps him in check.

01:16.624 --> 01:19.080
But really, he's like my brother.

01:19.794 --> 01:23.412
What do I know about diamonds?
I'm a boxing promoter.

01:23.715 --> 01:27.298
I was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago, and then:

01:27.594 --> 01:29.752
What do I know about diamonds?

01:30.597 --> 01:32.673
Don't they come from Antwerp?

01:33.642 --> 01:36.892
-Himy, would you listen to this?
-Do we have a choice?

01:37.187 --> 01:40.853
It wasn't meant to be taken literally.

01:41.150 --> 01:43.902
It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.

01:44.153 --> 01:46.193
It's bound with moral fibre...

01:46.489 --> 01:50.072
...but asking a grown man
to believe it?

01:51.077 --> 01:52.322
What is it?

01:54.580 --> 01:56.075
Well, what is it?

01:57.750 --> 02:01.084
What you want I should do,
drop my pants?

02:01.379 --> 02:02.957
Okay, go through.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.380
It's a nice story.

02:07.093 --> 02:10.048
It's just that. Just a story.

02:10.347 --> 02:13.716
Catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation.

02:14.017 --> 02:16.425
Enough already. Ruben, say something.

02:16.729 --> 02:19.267
Listen. Are you busy?
I'll tell you the whole story.

02:19.523 --> 02:23.735
The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for ''young woman''...

02:24.028 --> 02:26.151
... into the Greek word for ''virgin. ''

02:26.405 --> 02:28.813
It was an easy mistake to make...

02:29.075 --> 02:33.618
...because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.

02:43.590 --> 02:45.748
So, they came up with a prophecy:

02:46.051 --> 02:50.215
''Behold, the virgin shall conceive
and bear us a son. ''

02:50.472 --> 02:54.517
You understand? It was ''virgin''
that caught people's attention.

02:54.810 --> 02:58.974
It's not everyday a virgin conceives
and bears a son.

03:15.081 --> 03:19.293
But leave that for a couple
of hundred years to stew...

03:19.586 --> 03:23.121
...and next thing you know you have
the Holy Catholic Church.

03:23.423 --> 03:26.508
Oy vay, what are you saying?

03:26.760 --> 03:29.333
I'm saying, just because
it's written...

03:29.638 --> 03:31.132
... doesn't make it so.

03:31.432 --> 03:35.299
Gives them hope. It's not important
whether it's fact or fiction.

03:35.603 --> 03:37.975
-People like to believe.
-I don't want to hear anymore.

03:38.230 --> 03:41.481
Anyway, who is it that we're seeing?

03:42.151 --> 03:43.776
-Michael.
-Hello?

03:45.530 --> 03:46.728
Mutti.

03:47.031 --> 03:50.649
Rudy! Rud, Rud, let them in, please.

03:53.454 --> 03:56.658
Rud, it's okay, let them through.

03:56.916 --> 03:57.912
-Michael.
-Mutti.

03:58.168 --> 04:02.830
You've kept us waiting for half an hour.
Are you trying to give me heartburn?

04:09.346 --> 04:10.805
Lie down on the floor.

04:13.350 --> 04:14.548
Get on the floor!

04:15.311 --> 04:16.509
Lie on the floor!

04:16.812 --> 04:18.471
Get on the fucking floor!

04:19.482 --> 04:22.103
-Get down!
-Get fucking down!

04:22.735 --> 04:24.609
Down on the floor! Get down!

04:24.904 --> 04:26.102
On the ground!

04:30.493 --> 04:32.118
Get down, I say!

04:32.412 --> 04:34.405
-Time.
-Seven minutes!

04:38.210 --> 04:39.408
Where is the stone?

04:43.048 --> 04:44.756
Where is the stone?

04:46.301 --> 04:48.923
Where is the stone?

04:54.101 --> 04:55.679
Michael, where is the stone?

06:21.859 --> 06:23.935
When does your plane leave?

06:24.487 --> 06:26.231
Twenty minutes.

06:26.990 --> 06:28.532
Give me your gun.

06:40.087 --> 06:42.079
When you get to London...

06:42.339 --> 06:44.166
...if you want a gun...

06:44.967 --> 06:46.295
...call this number.

06:50.806 --> 06:53.095
-Boris.
-Boris.

06:53.809 --> 06:56.514
He can get you anything you need.

07:03.653 --> 07:05.527
Is he allowed to do that?

07:05.864 --> 07:10.111
It's an unlicensed boxing match.
It's not a tickling competition.

07:10.410 --> 07:12.450
These lads are out
to hurt each other.

07:13.163 --> 07:15.037
What's with those sausages,
Charlie?

07:15.332 --> 07:16.910
Two minutes, Turkish.

07:18.627 --> 07:22.328
Look at it. How am I supposed
to run this thing from that?

07:22.631 --> 07:24.090
We'll need a proper office.

07:24.383 --> 07:27.301
I want a new one.
You're going to buy it for me.

07:27.595 --> 07:29.137
Why me?

07:29.889 --> 07:31.763
Well, you know about caravans.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.427
How's that?

07:33.768 --> 07:37.101
You spent a summer in one.
Which means you know more than me.

07:37.397 --> 07:40.563
And I don't want to have me pants
pulled down over the price.

07:40.858 --> 07:42.139
What's wrong with this one?

07:43.945 --> 07:45.736
Oh, nothing, Tommy.

07:46.031 --> 07:47.822
It's tiptop.

07:48.074 --> 07:49.866
I'm just not sure about the colour.

07:51.953 --> 07:54.242
It's all arranged.
You just got to pick it up.

07:54.915 --> 07:56.290
Here's an address.

07:58.001 --> 07:59.460
It's a campsite.

08:00.337 --> 08:04.038
You've got 10 grand, and
it would be nice to see change.

08:04.842 --> 08:08.009
-What's happening with them sausages?
-Five minutes.

08:10.264 --> 08:12.838
It was two minutes five minutes ago.

08:13.100 --> 08:14.725
They ain't pikeys, are they?

08:15.019 --> 08:17.641
I fucking hate pikeys.

08:17.939 --> 08:20.512
You're a sensitive boy, Tommy.

08:23.319 --> 08:25.312
Fuck me. Hold tight.

08:25.864 --> 08:28.402
-What's that?
-It's me belt.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.989
No, Tommy. There's a gun
in your trousers.

08:31.286 --> 08:34.371
-What's a gun doing in your trousers?
-It's for protection.

08:34.623 --> 08:35.821
Protection from what?

08:36.124 --> 08:37.916
''Zee'' Germans?

08:38.168 --> 08:41.335
What's to stop it blowing your
bollocks off when you sit?

08:41.589 --> 08:44.792
-Where did you get it?
-Boris The Blade.

08:45.050 --> 08:47.542
You mean Boris the sneaky,
fucking Russian.

08:48.387 --> 08:49.798
Heavy, isn't it?

08:51.766 --> 08:52.715
Heavy is good.

08:54.018 --> 08:55.181
Heavy is reliable.

08:55.436 --> 08:58.058
If it doesn't work,
you can always hit him with it.

08:58.314 --> 09:01.399
Boris The Blade,
or Boris The Bullet-Dodger.

09:01.693 --> 09:04.943
Bent as the Soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it.

09:05.196 --> 09:09.241
Apparently, it's just impossible
to kill the bastard.

09:10.869 --> 09:13.194
Back to my partner, Tommy.

09:13.580 --> 09:15.288
Tommy runs the other business...

09:15.582 --> 09:17.160
... the slot machines...

09:17.459 --> 09:20.959
... which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on Gorgeous' hands.

09:21.213 --> 09:25.543
However, Tommy's a little preoccupied
with protection at present.

09:26.552 --> 09:28.046
All right, I'll take it.

09:28.596 --> 09:32.214
There's a reason for Tommy's newfound
enthusiasm for firearms.

09:32.517 --> 09:36.930
Sooner or later, in unlicensed boxing,
you have to deal with that reason:

09:37.230 --> 09:38.428
Brick Top.

09:38.731 --> 09:41.305
If that's not worth a bet,
I don't know what is.

09:41.568 --> 09:44.652
-He doesn't look bad, does he?
-No, he looks great.

09:44.946 --> 09:46.322
He'll do you proud.

09:46.615 --> 09:50.660
You reckon that's what people should
do for me, Gary? Do me proud?

09:50.911 --> 09:51.942
It's what you deserve.

09:52.204 --> 09:54.576
Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.

09:55.624 --> 09:56.822
Dogs do that.

09:57.584 --> 09:59.328
You're not a dog, are you?

09:59.628 --> 10:01.004
No. No, I'm not.

10:01.464 --> 10:02.662
However...

10:03.716 --> 10:07.167
...you do have all the characteristics
of a dog, Gary.

10:07.470 --> 10:08.668
All except loyalty.

10:08.971 --> 10:13.349
It's rumoured that his favourite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun...

10:13.643 --> 10:17.771
...a plastic bag, a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs.

10:18.732 --> 10:22.397
You're a ruthless little cunt, Liam.
I'll give you that.

10:24.654 --> 10:27.359
But I got no time for grouses.

10:29.451 --> 10:31.527
Feed him to the pigs, Errol.

10:33.038 --> 10:35.245
What the fuck are you two looking at?

10:38.210 --> 10:42.504
If you got to deal with him, just
make sure you don't end up owing him.

10:42.757 --> 10:44.002
Then you're in his debt.

10:44.258 --> 10:46.465
Which means, you're in his pocket.

10:46.761 --> 10:50.094
And once you're in that,
you ain't ever coming out.

10:50.765 --> 10:53.849
I hear he's a good fighter,
so I'll use him.

10:54.102 --> 10:56.308
I'll be doing you a favour, boy.

10:56.563 --> 10:59.433
What he means is,
I'm doing him a favour.

11:00.108 --> 11:05.185
Because everybody knows nobody takes
a dive in my fights. Unlike his.

11:06.198 --> 11:08.072
Here, Errol, I don't think
he likes me.

11:08.325 --> 11:09.784
You don't like me, do you?

11:10.077 --> 11:11.357
Don't know what you mean.

11:11.662 --> 11:14.616
I do know I can't wait to get
out of here. It stinks.

11:15.541 --> 11:20.120
My fights finish prompt so we can get
out before the authorities find out.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.621
Play your cards right
and I'll sort you out.

11:22.924 --> 11:25.331
You can sort me out by showing me out.

11:25.635 --> 11:28.422
It's hard to make a living
in boxing, so now and then...

11:28.680 --> 11:31.218
...you do something
against your principles.

11:31.516 --> 11:34.470
Basically, you have to forget
you got any.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.138
Are they Lancashire pigs?

11:36.396 --> 11:37.890
Who's talking to you?

11:38.481 --> 11:41.482
Oh, yeah, Tommy.
Brick Top loves Tommy.

11:42.903 --> 11:43.934
Don't let me down.

11:45.197 --> 11:47.569
You don't want to let me down, do you?

11:49.785 --> 11:51.742
See you ringside.

11:54.373 --> 11:58.537
Boris, Franky-fucking-Four Fingers...

11:58.836 --> 12:01.457
...has a diamond the size of a fist.

12:01.756 --> 12:05.339
I have told you it's in the briefcase
connected to his arm.

12:05.593 --> 12:07.800
I sent him to you to buy a gun.

12:08.054 --> 12:10.841
What more do you want me to do,
hit him for you?

12:11.099 --> 12:13.471
But don't you hit him either.

12:13.768 --> 12:16.805
Americans can't know it was Russian.

12:17.105 --> 12:18.730
It will come back to me.

12:20.984 --> 12:22.893
You're my brother, so think like it.

12:24.947 --> 12:27.189
Get somebody else to steal that stone!

12:27.449 --> 12:29.525
I don't want it getting back to me.

12:29.827 --> 12:32.662
And don't have him killed.
It will raise suspicion.

12:32.913 --> 12:34.657
So don't use idiots for the job.

12:34.957 --> 12:38.540
He'll stay in London a couple of
days before he goes to New York...

12:38.794 --> 12:41.202
...so move quick. Okay?

12:45.093 --> 12:46.468
One more thing.

12:46.761 --> 12:48.303
It might help.

12:48.847 --> 12:50.590
He loves to gamble.

12:52.475 --> 12:53.970
Eighty-six carats?

12:54.269 --> 12:56.178
Brilliant cut, beautiful make.

12:57.981 --> 12:59.475
A beautiful stone.

12:59.775 --> 13:00.770
You're a good boy, Franky.

13:01.026 --> 13:04.110
And you did a real good job.
Now when do you get back?

13:04.363 --> 13:09.155
I got to move the two-grainers here,
get a better price. Couple of days.

13:09.410 --> 13:11.901
-Talk to my cousin Dougie.
-Doug The Head?

13:15.916 --> 13:16.746
And Franky....

13:17.418 --> 13:19.494
-And what?
-Stay out of those casinos.

13:22.882 --> 13:24.626
You did a good job, bubbe.

13:24.926 --> 13:27.797
-Don't go screwing it up, all right?
-I hear you, Avi.

13:28.346 --> 13:30.422
I'll see you, Avi.

13:33.643 --> 13:34.972
Eighty-six carats.

13:35.228 --> 13:36.853
-Where?
-London.

13:37.147 --> 13:38.689
-London?
-London.

13:38.940 --> 13:40.933
-London?
-Yes, London.

13:41.818 --> 13:44.523
You know, fish, chips, cup of tea...

13:44.822 --> 13:47.942
...bad food, worse weather,
Mary-fucking-Poppins. London!

13:49.952 --> 13:50.948
Not for me.

13:51.245 --> 13:54.329
That's Doug The Head.
Everybody knows Doug The Head.

13:54.624 --> 13:57.079
If it's stones and it's stolen,
he's the man to speak to.

13:57.335 --> 13:58.663
Pretends he's Jewish.

13:58.961 --> 14:00.456
Wishes he was Jewish.

14:00.713 --> 14:02.920
Even tells his family
they're Jewish...

14:03.216 --> 14:06.466
...but he's about as Jewish
as he is a fucking monkey.

14:06.761 --> 14:10.676
He thinks it's good for business.
And in the diamond business...

14:10.932 --> 14:13.304
-... it is good for business.
-Avi!

14:13.560 --> 14:15.636
He'll be there today.
Take care of him.

14:15.937 --> 14:18.511
Avi, you know I won't buy schtrops.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.395
He isn't selling schtrops.
Make it smaller.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.728
Who do you take me for?
This is England.

14:23.987 --> 14:25.779
We play by the rules.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.360
Listen to me.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.908
If the stones are kosher,
then I'll buy them, won't I?

14:31.203 --> 14:35.071
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my lunchtime. Bye.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.547
What are you doing here?

14:42.799 --> 14:44.626
It's a free country, isn't it?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.757
Well, it ain't a free shop, is it?

14:48.054 --> 14:49.846
So fuck off.

15:00.526 --> 15:03.147
I want to see you two girls
up in my office.

15:03.779 --> 15:05.487
I had cousin Avi on the phone.

15:05.781 --> 15:08.486
-You got to go see him.
-Yeah, Dad. You told us.

15:08.784 --> 15:12.070
-He's a big mucker in New York.
-Yeah, Dad. You told us.

15:12.330 --> 15:14.785
I want to see you girls
up in my office.

15:15.041 --> 15:17.496
Yeah, Dad. You told us.

15:23.007 --> 15:25.581
The weight is sign of reliability.

15:26.428 --> 15:28.467
I always go for reliability.

15:36.313 --> 15:38.270
I'll take it.

15:38.690 --> 15:40.101
How much do you want for it?

15:40.359 --> 15:41.522
Nothing.

15:43.195 --> 15:46.362
Okay, so what do you want for it?

15:46.615 --> 15:48.158
I want you to do something for me.

15:50.244 --> 15:52.071
There is a fight in couple of days.

15:53.539 --> 15:54.915
What kind of a fight?

15:55.166 --> 15:56.826
Unlicensed boxing.

15:58.378 --> 16:01.213
There is a bookies I know
that will take bets.

16:04.259 --> 16:06.002
If you place one down for me...

16:06.636 --> 16:08.131
...we will call it quits.

16:08.430 --> 16:10.672
-Why don't you put it down yourself?
-Well...

16:12.309 --> 16:16.307
...there is not too many bookies
that takes those kind of bets.

16:17.189 --> 16:20.724
And I already have an outstanding
debt with the house.

16:22.945 --> 16:25.483
I know something most don't.

16:26.365 --> 16:27.907
So, nu?

16:29.076 --> 16:30.619
What do you know?

16:35.291 --> 16:38.043
It's a campsite. A pikey campsite.

16:38.294 --> 16:41.295
-Ten points.
-What are we doing here?

16:42.132 --> 16:45.382
-We're buying a caravan.
-Off a pack of fucking pikeys?

16:45.677 --> 16:48.548
What's wrong with you?
This will get messy.

16:48.847 --> 16:49.629
Not if you're here.

16:49.890 --> 16:51.717
Oh, you bastard.

16:51.975 --> 16:54.466
I fucking hate pikeys.

16:57.523 --> 16:58.898
That's a flash car, mister.

16:59.149 --> 17:00.608
Not as flash as your bike.

17:00.901 --> 17:02.775
Who are you looking for?

17:03.028 --> 17:04.272
Mr. O'Neil.

17:05.114 --> 17:07.271
-Want me to get him?
-That's a good lad.

17:07.532 --> 17:09.277
Piss off.

17:10.243 --> 17:12.818
-Are you going to go get him for me?
-Yeah.

17:13.790 --> 17:16.826
-What are you waiting for?
-The five quid you'll pay me.

17:17.126 --> 17:18.751
Fuck off, I'll find him meself.

17:19.002 --> 17:21.291
-Two fifty.
-You can have a quid.

17:21.548 --> 17:23.089
You're a real tight fucker.

17:23.340 --> 17:25.381
There was a problem with gypsies.

17:25.676 --> 17:27.088
What're you doing?
Get out of the way, man.

17:27.345 --> 17:29.385
You can't understand
what's being said.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.223
You Tommy? Come about the caravan?

17:31.475 --> 17:33.717
-Mr. O'Neil.
-Fuck, man. Call me Mickey.

17:33.977 --> 17:35.520
Not Irish, not English.

17:35.813 --> 17:38.019
-How are you?
-Weather's been kind.

17:38.315 --> 17:39.975
It's just Pikey.

17:40.734 --> 17:42.359
Would you look at the size of him?

17:42.945 --> 17:44.439
How big are you?

17:44.697 --> 17:46.690
-Kids, how big is he?
-Big, for sure.

17:46.949 --> 17:49.571
Hey, Mam, come and look at the size
of this fella.

17:50.328 --> 17:54.824
Bet you box a little, can't you, sir?
You look like a boxer.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.871
Get out of the way.
See if they'd like a drink.

17:58.128 --> 17:59.408
I could murder one.

17:59.713 --> 18:02.714
Be no murdering done around here,
I don't mind telling you.

18:02.966 --> 18:04.959
Get your hands out of there.

18:05.260 --> 18:06.802
Cup of tea for the big fella?

18:07.054 --> 18:10.174
Don't be silly, Mickey.
Offer the man a proper drink.

18:11.809 --> 18:12.840
You little bugger.

18:13.102 --> 18:16.268
-Is the big fella not coming with us?
-He's minding the car.

18:16.564 --> 18:20.312
-What does he think we are, thieves?
-No, nothing like that.

18:20.568 --> 18:23.688
-He just likes looking after cars.
-Good dags. Do you like dags?

18:24.530 --> 18:25.728
-Dags?
-What?

18:26.032 --> 18:28.071
-Yeah, dags.
-Dags. You like dags?

18:28.576 --> 18:30.320
Oh, dogs.

18:30.578 --> 18:32.286
Sure, I like dags.

18:32.539 --> 18:35.326
-I like caravans more.
-You're very welcome.

18:46.720 --> 18:50.469
Pikeys are well-known for their
skills of negotiation in business.

18:50.766 --> 18:52.723
It's probably why
they talk like that...

18:53.018 --> 18:55.094
...so you can't follow
what's being said.

18:55.354 --> 18:58.770
But if Tommy can get the caravan
for less than the price asked...

18:59.066 --> 19:01.392
... on his return
there will be ice cream.

19:01.694 --> 19:03.437
Good dog, good family.

19:03.696 --> 19:06.365
He'll get a little homesick,
but he'll get over it.

19:06.908 --> 19:09.529
See you later, lads. See you, boss.

19:09.786 --> 19:11.944
All right, Mickey. Laters.

19:13.415 --> 19:14.909
I don't see what the fuss is about.

19:15.625 --> 19:16.906
They aren't bad fellas.

19:27.137 --> 19:29.344
The deal was, you bought it
how you saw it.

19:29.598 --> 19:32.683
Look, I've helped you as much
as I'm going to help you.

19:32.977 --> 19:34.768
See that car? Use it.

19:35.020 --> 19:38.639
You should fuck off now while
you still got the legs to carry you.

19:40.318 --> 19:41.860
Nobody brings you...

19:42.111 --> 19:44.982
...unless they're trying
to say something without talking.

19:45.948 --> 19:48.866
Just give our money back
and you can keep your caravan.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.161
Why do I want a caravan
that's got no wheels?

19:52.414 --> 19:55.533
-You want to settle this with a fight?
-Over my dead body.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.114
Now, go on! Go on!

19:57.419 --> 20:01.333
I'll not have you fighting!
You know what happens when you fight!

20:01.965 --> 20:03.341
Get her to sit down.

20:04.092 --> 20:05.635
For fuck's sake!

20:11.850 --> 20:13.594
Want the money?
I ain't fucked you.

20:14.145 --> 20:16.386
I'll fight you for it. You and me.

20:29.536 --> 20:31.694
So that's the kind of fight
it'll be.

20:32.330 --> 20:34.157
You want to stay down.

20:39.087 --> 20:40.629
You want to stay down!

20:43.801 --> 20:46.173
Get back down and fucking stay down.

20:46.470 --> 20:48.842
I promise you, you want to stay down.

20:49.098 --> 20:51.174
Deadly kick for a fat fucker,
you know that?

20:51.475 --> 20:53.432
Cheeky bastard.

21:00.485 --> 21:02.228
-Okay, lads.
-Get him on his feet.

21:03.696 --> 21:04.728
Get back down...

21:04.989 --> 21:07.777
...or you will not be coming up
next time.

21:11.329 --> 21:12.195
Bollocks to you.

21:12.831 --> 21:14.622
This is sick. I'm out of here.

21:14.916 --> 21:17.407
You're not going anywhere,
you thick lump.

21:20.797 --> 21:22.671
You stay until the job's done.

21:55.876 --> 21:59.375
It turned out that the sweet-talking,
tattoo-sporting pikey...

21:59.630 --> 22:02.417
... was a gypsy bare-knuckle
boxing champion.

22:02.674 --> 22:05.379
Which makes him harder
than a coffin nail.

22:06.303 --> 22:09.886
Right now that's the last thing
on Tommy's mind.

22:10.141 --> 22:12.846
If Gorgeous doesn't wake up
in the next few minutes...

22:13.144 --> 22:15.350
... Tommy knows he'll be buried
with him.

22:16.105 --> 22:18.643
Why would the gypsies
want to explain...

22:18.941 --> 22:21.065
... why a man died in their campsite?

22:21.319 --> 22:24.522
Not when they can bury the pair
of them and just move camp.

22:24.864 --> 22:28.280
It's not like they got
social security numbers, is it?

22:28.618 --> 22:30.860
Tommy, ''The Tit''...

22:31.121 --> 22:32.745
... is praying.

22:32.998 --> 22:34.278
And if he isn't...

22:34.583 --> 22:36.575
...he fucking should be.

23:04.406 --> 23:05.568
Bad Boy.

23:06.199 --> 23:07.943
-Sol.
-Easy.

23:08.243 --> 23:10.948
No, it's a moissanite.

23:11.204 --> 23:12.118
A what?

23:12.706 --> 23:15.742
A moissanite is an artificial
diamond, Lincoln.

23:16.001 --> 23:17.032
It's Mickey Mouse.

23:17.961 --> 23:19.041
Spurious.

23:19.838 --> 23:21.297
Not genuine.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.465
And it's worth...

23:24.009 --> 23:25.005
...fuck-all.

23:25.261 --> 23:28.215
Bad Boy, I keep telling you,
stick to being a gangster.

23:28.514 --> 23:30.306
Leave this game to me and Sol.

23:31.767 --> 23:32.966
Laters.

23:36.773 --> 23:37.852
What is that, Vince?

23:38.107 --> 23:39.815
This is a dog, Sol.

23:40.068 --> 23:42.226
You are not bringing
that thing in here.

23:42.487 --> 23:44.147
It's only a fucking dog.

23:44.406 --> 23:45.948
-Where'd you get it?
-The gyppos.

23:46.199 --> 23:47.278
Here.

23:48.743 --> 23:50.368
They threw it in with the moody gold.

23:51.622 --> 23:55.240
You know gyppos, Sol. They're always
throwing dogs in with deals.

23:55.501 --> 23:56.746
It better not be dangerous.

23:58.879 --> 24:00.753
What do you think you're doing now?

24:01.340 --> 24:04.127
I want him to get used
to the shop, don't I?

24:06.345 --> 24:07.721
Stop the dog!

24:07.972 --> 24:09.170
Come back!

24:09.932 --> 24:11.177
All right, Boris?

24:12.143 --> 24:15.227
-Don't worry about the dog.
-I'm not.

24:16.648 --> 24:18.023
What can I do for you?

24:19.025 --> 24:20.567
I have a job for you.

24:20.819 --> 24:22.527
I already have a job.

24:23.446 --> 24:26.234
Fifty grand for half a day's work.

24:27.534 --> 24:28.613
Go on.

24:28.869 --> 24:32.154
I want you to hold up a bookies.

24:37.086 --> 24:38.710
From Russia with love, eh?

24:39.588 --> 24:41.795
I have stones to sell...

24:42.049 --> 24:45.169
...fat to chew and many men
to see about many ducks...

24:45.428 --> 24:46.970
...so if I am not rushing you....

24:47.722 --> 24:51.007
Slow down, Franky, my son.
When in Rome.

24:51.976 --> 24:54.550
I am not in Rome, Doug.

24:54.812 --> 24:56.473
I am in a rush.

24:56.981 --> 24:58.357
I got to make the bookies.

24:58.608 --> 24:59.806
Bookies?

25:01.027 --> 25:03.067
-What are you betting on?
-Bomber Harris.

25:04.656 --> 25:06.281
The unlicensed boxer?

25:09.036 --> 25:10.993
Do you know something that I don't?

25:11.747 --> 25:16.160
Bubbe, I probably know
a lot you don't.

25:17.795 --> 25:20.084
He's bad to the bone,
ain't you, Tyrone?

25:20.339 --> 25:21.537
Of course I am.

25:21.799 --> 25:25.583
Tyrone'll drive for us. He's
done a rally driving course.

25:25.845 --> 25:27.043
Of course I have.

25:29.849 --> 25:32.636
I don't want that dog
dribbling on my seats.

25:32.894 --> 25:34.388
Your seats?

25:34.646 --> 25:36.888
Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.

25:37.232 --> 25:39.059
While I'm at the wheel, it's my car...

25:39.317 --> 25:43.695
...so stop that dog dribbling
on my seats. All right?

25:43.947 --> 25:46.818
I can't believe you found it.
Where'd it go?

25:47.075 --> 25:48.783
It went back to the gyppos.

25:49.036 --> 25:51.741
Shut up.
And how could it find them?

25:52.039 --> 25:55.242
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a dog, Sol.

25:55.793 --> 25:57.121
Ask him.

25:58.170 --> 26:00.044
It's like he's
a fucking homing beacon.

26:01.966 --> 26:03.164
Steady on the brakes.

26:04.093 --> 26:05.671
I thought you said
he could drive, Sol.

26:05.970 --> 26:09.719
Don't worry about me. Just worry
about that dog on my seats.

26:10.016 --> 26:11.475
All right?

26:32.206 --> 26:33.237
What?

26:33.832 --> 26:37.367
You said he was a getaway driver.
What the fuck can he get away from?

26:37.628 --> 26:40.463
Don't worry about Tyrone.
He can move when he has to.

26:40.715 --> 26:42.257
Worry about getting us a gun.

26:47.555 --> 26:48.634
What's that?

26:49.599 --> 26:52.137
This is a shotgun, Sol.

26:52.393 --> 26:55.181
It's a fucking
anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.

26:55.438 --> 26:59.388
-I want to raise pulses, don't I?
-You'll raise hell, never mind pulses.

27:17.795 --> 27:20.120
That does not look like a bookies.

27:20.423 --> 27:24.586
Why'd we stop here? What's the
matter with that space over there?

27:24.969 --> 27:26.713
It's too tight.

27:27.472 --> 27:28.847
Too tight?

27:29.891 --> 27:32.014
You could land a
jumbo-fucking-jet in there.

27:32.268 --> 27:36.480
Leave him alone.
He's a natural. Ain't you, Tyrone?

27:36.773 --> 27:38.315
Of course I am.

27:49.453 --> 27:52.490
A natural fucking idiot.
Tyrone, what've you done?

27:52.790 --> 27:54.783
Yeah, Tyrone, what have you done?

27:55.084 --> 27:57.836
Look, you hassle me,
you see what happens.

27:58.087 --> 28:00.495
It's all right.
No, don't move it now.

28:00.756 --> 28:03.378
People'll see the damage.
Why'd you do that?

28:03.634 --> 28:04.630
I didn't see it.

28:04.886 --> 28:08.966
It's a four-ton truck. It's not like
it's a packet of fucking peanuts.

28:09.224 --> 28:10.718
It was at a funny angle.

28:13.270 --> 28:14.764
It's behind you, Tyrone.

28:15.021 --> 28:17.429
Whenever you reverse,
things come from behind you.

28:18.108 --> 28:20.397
Control that dog as well.

28:21.111 --> 28:23.436
-Get that dog off him.
-Get it off me.

28:25.032 --> 28:28.235
Give me that squeaky toy.
It shut him up last time.

28:32.164 --> 28:33.160
Don't snatch.

28:35.418 --> 28:37.042
He can't swallow the whole ball.

28:39.922 --> 28:41.085
Yeah.

28:44.135 --> 28:45.629
Why the fuck...

28:45.929 --> 28:48.217
...did you put Gorgeous George...

28:48.515 --> 28:51.136
...into a bare-knuckle boxing match...

28:51.434 --> 28:53.676
...two days before
he had to fight The Bomber?

28:53.937 --> 28:57.223
He was half his size.
I didn't expect him to get hurt.

28:57.482 --> 29:01.646
You put the man into
a bare-knuckle boxing match.

29:02.154 --> 29:04.312
What the fuck did you expect?

29:04.657 --> 29:06.898
A grease-down and a shiatsu?

29:07.159 --> 29:09.567
Who took the jam out of your doughnut?

29:09.870 --> 29:12.278
You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut.

29:12.540 --> 29:13.915
You did.

29:17.044 --> 29:18.076
You said get a good deal.

29:18.337 --> 29:20.876
I fail to recognize
the correlation...

29:21.132 --> 29:24.216
...between losing 10 grand,
hospitalizing Gorgeous...

29:24.469 --> 29:25.749
...and a good deal.

29:26.346 --> 29:28.220
How'll we explain this to Brick Top?

29:28.473 --> 29:30.264
That his fight won't happen?

29:31.017 --> 29:32.215
We replace the fighter.

29:32.477 --> 29:34.304
Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?

29:34.563 --> 29:36.437
Who the fuck will we
replace him with?

29:37.065 --> 29:38.441
What about John The Gun?

29:39.693 --> 29:41.152
Or Mad Fist Willy?

29:41.612 --> 29:43.604
You're not Mr. Current Affairs,
are you?

29:44.198 --> 29:45.858
Mad Fist went mad...

29:46.408 --> 29:48.734
...and The Gun shot himself.

29:53.833 --> 29:54.948
Jesus.

29:59.088 --> 29:59.870
What?

30:00.131 --> 30:02.088
Let's use the fucking pikey.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.841
-How much you gonna pay us?
-10 K.

30:06.096 --> 30:09.429
Me bollocks. Lose more
than that running for the bus.

30:17.649 --> 30:18.764
All right.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.984
I'll do it for a caravan.

30:22.863 --> 30:23.812
A what?

30:24.073 --> 30:25.235
A caravan.

30:25.491 --> 30:29.074
-Top of the range and all that.
-It was us that wanted a caravan.

30:29.704 --> 30:31.743
Anyway, what's wrong with this one?

30:31.998 --> 30:34.074
It's not for me.
It's for me ma.

30:36.044 --> 30:36.957
Your what?

30:37.211 --> 30:38.326
His ma.

31:05.574 --> 31:07.982
Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.

31:08.244 --> 31:11.743
They take bets on anything
that involves blood and pain.

31:11.998 --> 31:13.373
Now I'm changing fighters...

31:14.125 --> 31:17.043
...and Brick Top's gonna
exploit the situation.

31:17.337 --> 31:19.958
He's gonna pull my pants down,
grease me up...

31:20.215 --> 31:22.457
...and aim for penetration.

31:22.759 --> 31:24.917
If I didn't have
the replacement pikey...

31:25.178 --> 31:27.467
...he'd want to split me in half.

31:31.226 --> 31:33.551
They could charm the paint off walls,
these fellas.

31:41.612 --> 31:43.854
Look mean now,
you hairy fucker, won't you?

31:45.700 --> 31:47.988
Shits himself when
you put him in the ring.

31:48.244 --> 31:50.817
Poke him with a stick,
you watch his bollocks grow.

31:51.789 --> 31:53.616
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?

31:54.918 --> 31:56.709
We've lost Gorgeous George.

32:00.799 --> 32:02.708
You're gonna have to repeat that.

32:03.552 --> 32:05.793
We've lost Gorgeous George.

32:06.388 --> 32:08.262
Well, where'd you lose him?

32:08.557 --> 32:11.048
He ain't a set
of fucking car keys, is he?

32:11.351 --> 32:13.973
And it's not as if he's
incon-fucking-spicuous, is it?

32:14.229 --> 32:15.178
We're not backing out.

32:15.439 --> 32:18.357
You bet your bollocks to
a barn dance you're not.

32:18.609 --> 32:20.020
We're changing the fighter.

32:22.154 --> 32:24.859
Oh, fuck me,
your lady friend got a voice?

32:25.116 --> 32:27.274
Who are you changing him to,
sweetheart?

32:27.577 --> 32:29.865
You won't know him, but he's mustard.

32:30.121 --> 32:31.152
Mustard?

32:31.414 --> 32:35.115
I don't care if he's
Muhammad '' I'm Hard'' Bruce Lee...

32:35.418 --> 32:36.794
...you can't change fighters.

32:37.045 --> 32:39.203
-You've still got your fight.
-No.

32:39.464 --> 32:42.667
I lose all bets at the bookies.
You can't change fighters.

32:42.926 --> 32:46.710
So, no, I don't have my fight,
do I, you fucking prat?

32:46.972 --> 32:48.680
You can take bets at the fight.

32:49.141 --> 32:51.548
Put a lead on her, Turkish,
before she gets bitten.

32:51.810 --> 32:54.099
Do you want to get bitten, sweetheart?

32:59.777 --> 33:02.149
Make sure your man goes down
in the fourth.

33:02.738 --> 33:05.739
You understand me now,
don't you, Turkish?

33:07.285 --> 33:09.610
This is the one place
I didn't want to be:

33:09.871 --> 33:11.116
In his debt.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.947
Which now means I'm in his pocket.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.996
You're on thin-fucking-ice,
my pedigree chums.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.918
And I shall be under it
when it breaks.

33:21.216 --> 33:22.414
Now, fuck off.

33:31.101 --> 33:33.936
Doug, where's Franky Four Fingers?

33:34.229 --> 33:37.396
I don't know. I'm not his mother.
But I'm seeing him later.

33:37.650 --> 33:40.223
-When later?
-He said he wanted cash.

33:40.528 --> 33:43.482
So he's coming back
after he's been to a fight.

33:50.079 --> 33:51.455
A fight?

33:51.831 --> 33:55.995
What do you mean, a fight?
A boxing match?

33:56.544 --> 34:00.922
-Is there gambling involved?
-It's a boxing match, Avi.

34:01.174 --> 34:03.665
-Did he have a case with him?
-Yes, he had a case.

34:03.927 --> 34:05.635
And this schmuck is gambling?

34:05.929 --> 34:10.507
You're talking about Franky '' I've got
a problem with gambling'' Four Fingers.

34:10.768 --> 34:12.344
Avi, I'm not telepathic.

34:12.603 --> 34:14.679
You're plenty stupid,
I'll give you that.

34:14.980 --> 34:17.554
Do you know why they call him
Franky Four Fingers?

34:17.817 --> 34:19.145
I have no idea.

34:19.402 --> 34:22.522
Because he makes stupid bets
with dangerous people.

34:22.822 --> 34:25.443
When he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop.

34:25.742 --> 34:27.650
And I'm not talking about
his fucking foreskin.

34:27.911 --> 34:29.321
I'm sure he can pay.

34:29.621 --> 34:33.286
Not with my goods. Got a toothbrush?
We're going to London.

34:33.583 --> 34:35.871
Do you hear that?
I'm coming to London!

34:40.632 --> 34:43.668
-Avi!
-Shut up and sit down, you bald fuck!

34:46.346 --> 34:48.505
I don't like leaving my own country...

34:48.766 --> 34:52.893
...especially leaving it for anything
less than warm, sandy beaches...

34:53.145 --> 34:55.683
...and cocktails
with little straw hats.

34:56.482 --> 34:58.225
We've got sandy beaches.

34:58.484 --> 35:00.311
So who the fuck wants to see them?

35:00.570 --> 35:04.437
I hope you can appreciate the concern
I have for my friend Franky.

35:04.699 --> 35:07.024
I'll find him,
and you'll help me find him.

35:07.327 --> 35:09.200
And we'll start at that fight.

35:11.456 --> 35:13.283
How am I gonna get it out?

35:13.792 --> 35:15.251
It will probably cough it up.

35:15.502 --> 35:16.747
Will he be all right?

35:17.087 --> 35:18.285
I hope not.

35:18.547 --> 35:21.667
-Are we gonna rob this bookies?
-Yes, big man.

35:21.925 --> 35:22.956
Why are we waiting?

35:23.260 --> 35:26.961
We are waiting for a man with
four fingers, carrying a briefcase.

35:27.222 --> 35:28.004
And why's that?

35:28.265 --> 35:33.141
Because the deal is, the Russian
gets the case, we get the money.

35:33.396 --> 35:34.854
What's in the case?

35:35.106 --> 35:39.353
For fuck's sake, Tyrone, just
concentrate on the steering wheel.

35:41.112 --> 35:42.108
Jesus.

35:42.363 --> 35:45.613
-Private night tonight, chaps.
-I'm well aware of that, my son.

35:45.867 --> 35:47.575
That's why we're here.

35:48.620 --> 35:50.529
Well done. This is the back way in.

35:50.830 --> 35:53.831
Oh, really?
I thought it was the front.

35:54.709 --> 35:57.876
-Private night tonight, chaps.
-We know. That's why we're here.

35:58.547 --> 35:59.661
Tickets.

35:59.965 --> 36:02.290
Are we ever gonna get into this place?

36:02.593 --> 36:05.428
Avi, Avi, you gotta understand.

36:05.721 --> 36:08.508
This ain't exactly Vegas,
and this ain't exactly legal.

36:08.766 --> 36:11.601
I'm not looking for Vegas
or for legal.

36:11.894 --> 36:13.638
I'm looking for Franky.

36:13.938 --> 36:17.437
I know that,
and he said he's gonna be here.

36:17.733 --> 36:20.438
-lf there's gambling, he'll be here.
-Let's not have a fuck-up.

36:20.695 --> 36:22.023
You won't let us down.

36:22.322 --> 36:26.189
He's going down in the fourth,
don't you worry about that.

36:29.996 --> 36:30.992
Is that him?

36:31.248 --> 36:33.406
I don't know.
How many fingers did he have?

36:33.667 --> 36:35.706
Sorry, I didn't get
the binoculars out in time.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.713
Let's not stand on ceremony.
Let's start the show.

36:54.939 --> 36:56.647
Do you know who
this bookies belongs to?

36:56.899 --> 36:59.900
If you know what's good for you
you'll give me everything--

37:05.450 --> 37:06.909
What are you doing?

37:07.160 --> 37:09.532
What does it look like
I'm doing up here?

37:11.748 --> 37:14.583
This is starting to hurt, Solomon.

37:14.876 --> 37:17.118
Drop the screen now.

37:20.340 --> 37:21.420
How you doing, Vince?

37:21.675 --> 37:24.047
I'd do a lot better
if you'd stop using my name.

37:24.303 --> 37:26.343
-Fill that bag.
-All bets are off.

37:26.931 --> 37:30.347
I am not in here
to make a fucking bet.

37:30.601 --> 37:31.764
Appreciated...

37:32.019 --> 37:33.893
...but all bets...

37:35.440 --> 37:36.815
...are...

37:37.108 --> 37:38.223
...off.

37:39.569 --> 37:42.903
If all bets are off, then there
can't be any money, can there?

37:44.366 --> 37:46.489
I ain't fucking buying that.

37:46.785 --> 37:50.201
That's handy because I ain't
fucking selling it. It's a fact.

37:51.248 --> 37:52.623
What have you got?

37:54.418 --> 37:55.960
Nothing, really.

37:58.046 --> 37:59.541
A few coins, but no notes.

38:02.426 --> 38:03.375
Show me your hands.

38:06.013 --> 38:07.211
You've got five fingers.

38:10.601 --> 38:11.597
Copper coins.

38:12.603 --> 38:15.439
What do you mean,
copper-fucking-coins?

38:24.240 --> 38:28.025
It won't open
because it's a security door.

38:28.286 --> 38:29.401
Hold that.

38:38.505 --> 38:39.881
My leg.

38:42.635 --> 38:46.335
What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.

38:54.605 --> 38:56.266
We're fucked.

39:03.406 --> 39:05.648
What the fuck are you two doing?

39:10.122 --> 39:11.201
Get us out of here.

39:17.254 --> 39:19.828
Tyrone, what are you doing?
Get us out of here!

39:27.557 --> 39:30.261
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?

39:33.605 --> 39:36.938
He's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinny.

39:39.152 --> 39:40.646
In the red corner...

39:40.946 --> 39:43.401
...we have the young
and unchallenged....

39:43.657 --> 39:47.904
So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?

39:48.203 --> 39:49.828
Just make sure he doesn't kill me.

39:50.497 --> 39:53.913
So give it up
for the bone-crunching...

39:54.168 --> 39:56.291
...one-punch machine gun...

39:56.587 --> 39:58.414
...Mickey!

40:03.511 --> 40:05.669
And in the other corner....

40:07.014 --> 40:09.090
Now, I know he looks
like a fat fucker--

40:09.392 --> 40:12.263
Well, he is a fat fucker,
but he's dirty and he's dangerous.

40:12.520 --> 40:17.348
Bomber ''The Mad Man'' Harris!

40:20.070 --> 40:22.146
Now, try and look like a fighter.

40:22.405 --> 40:24.861
Let's get ready...

40:25.117 --> 40:27.193
...to rumble!

41:00.904 --> 41:04.403
Do you realize I'm
fucking forty grand down?

41:04.700 --> 41:05.862
What's the fucking crack?

41:06.118 --> 41:08.787
-I'll make it up to you.
-I ain't happy.

41:09.079 --> 41:12.448
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Stand on me.

41:12.708 --> 41:15.744
Oh, that fucking pikey's
put me in it.

41:17.546 --> 41:19.669
Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.

41:19.924 --> 41:23.008
Listen, you fucking fringe,
if I throw a dog a bone...

41:23.261 --> 41:24.671
...I don't want to know
if it tastes good.

41:24.929 --> 41:29.924
Stop me again whilst I'm walking and
I'll cut your fucking jacobs off.

41:51.790 --> 41:54.661
-He's here.
-Well, you explain it to him.

42:01.968 --> 42:04.637
-What you doing?
-The case was attached to his arm.

42:04.929 --> 42:07.254
So why didn't you chop it off?

42:07.557 --> 42:09.763
We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.

42:10.059 --> 42:11.340
But he has the case.

42:11.603 --> 42:14.224
Look, we--
Well, you have a problem.

42:15.315 --> 42:17.723
There weren't much cash
at the bookies.

42:18.693 --> 42:19.856
Okay.

42:21.196 --> 42:22.774
Here is the 10 grand.

42:23.073 --> 42:25.944
No. Keep it. We want this.

42:26.368 --> 42:28.859
Well, at least half of this.

42:29.413 --> 42:31.951
What was in the case was mine.

42:32.208 --> 42:35.493
What was in the bookies was yours.
Okay?

42:35.795 --> 42:39.579
It wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.

42:39.882 --> 42:41.590
No, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

42:41.843 --> 42:45.342
We want half of this, and that's
because we're being generous.

42:45.638 --> 42:49.683
We could, by all rights, keep
the whole fucking stone, Boris.

42:59.361 --> 43:00.689
Watch out!

43:03.115 --> 43:04.858
Drop the gun, fat boy.

43:08.746 --> 43:12.364
You fucking idiots.
He could not know my name.

43:13.542 --> 43:15.202
Give me the stone.

43:16.295 --> 43:18.751
-It's in the case.
-What?

43:20.258 --> 43:21.171
It's in the case.

43:21.426 --> 43:23.003
You put the stone in the case?

43:24.470 --> 43:26.048
Open it and give me the stone.

43:27.265 --> 43:31.180
The only man who knew
the combination, you just shot.

44:00.883 --> 44:04.716
Now, it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.

44:04.971 --> 44:09.929
Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.

44:10.185 --> 44:13.768
I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.

44:14.606 --> 44:18.686
I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.

44:18.944 --> 44:22.728
But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.

44:22.990 --> 44:24.698
Once I have that, it's--

44:24.992 --> 44:26.023
Oink, oink.

44:26.744 --> 44:27.906
Shit.

44:30.206 --> 44:31.997
So that's where you keep the sugar.

44:33.834 --> 44:36.789
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

44:38.506 --> 44:40.250
That sounds like hostility,
doesn't it?

44:40.508 --> 44:42.833
And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?

44:43.762 --> 44:45.042
No, we don't, John.

44:57.025 --> 44:59.101
I just had them polished.

45:04.825 --> 45:06.782
Go and put the kettle on.

45:10.247 --> 45:13.664
-You take sugar?
-No, thank you, Turkish.

45:14.502 --> 45:16.293
I'm sweet enough.

45:25.096 --> 45:27.089
He's now your problem.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.798
Okay?

45:37.776 --> 45:41.857
You can keep the 10 grand,
along with the body...

45:42.114 --> 45:45.234
...but if I see you again,
you motherfuckers....

45:48.537 --> 45:49.913
Well, look at him.

45:57.130 --> 46:00.297
I've got a bare-knuckle fight
in a couple of days.

46:00.550 --> 46:01.713
I want to use the pikey.

46:03.303 --> 46:04.631
All right. Of course.

46:04.930 --> 46:07.136
Of course, fucking of course.

46:07.432 --> 46:09.840
I wasn't asking, I was telling.

46:10.936 --> 46:12.015
But this time...

46:12.854 --> 46:16.639
...I do want him to go down
in the fourth.

46:17.609 --> 46:21.654
And I do mean it, this time.

46:32.208 --> 46:35.458
Now, I know you come back here
to open your safe.

46:37.755 --> 46:39.832
So now you can open it.

46:40.216 --> 46:42.542
Turkish has been a busy
little bastard.

46:42.802 --> 46:44.546
I think he's got away with enough.

46:44.846 --> 46:48.844
Thinking can get you into trouble,
Errol. I shouldn't do so much of it.

46:49.142 --> 46:51.016
That takes care of one little piggy.

46:51.270 --> 46:54.105
Now find me the silly sods
who blagged the bookies.

46:54.398 --> 46:55.596
Find them today.

47:14.627 --> 47:17.083
Top of the morning
to you, Mrs. O'Neil.

47:17.922 --> 47:19.002
Tommy.

47:20.300 --> 47:23.550
You're a snake in the grass,
ain't you? Where'd they come from?

47:23.804 --> 47:26.045
You're looking for my boy, are you?

47:26.306 --> 47:28.762
-Do you know where I can find him?
-Yeah.

47:30.018 --> 47:31.976
Would you like
to share that information?

47:32.229 --> 47:34.637
I don't want you getting
my boy into trouble.

47:35.899 --> 47:39.150
He's my only boy.
And he's a good boy.

47:40.821 --> 47:42.102
He's coursing.

47:44.408 --> 47:45.951
What's coursing?

47:46.494 --> 47:47.407
Hare coursing.

47:48.287 --> 47:52.202
They set two lurchers--
They're dogs, before you ask.

47:53.084 --> 47:54.662
On a hare.

47:55.336 --> 47:58.373
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.

47:58.632 --> 48:00.671
So, what if it doesn't?

48:02.010 --> 48:05.462
Well, the big rabbit gets fucked,
doesn't it?

48:09.059 --> 48:10.684
Proper fucked?

48:11.395 --> 48:12.723
Yeah, Tommy.

48:13.147 --> 48:15.353
Before ''zee'' Germans get there.

48:19.236 --> 48:20.896
Do you know these tits, Errol?

48:20.946 --> 48:22.275
I know a lot of tits...

48:22.365 --> 48:24.986
...but I don't know any
as fucking stupid as these two.

48:25.076 --> 48:26.238
John?

48:26.786 --> 48:28.161
I can't help, guv.

48:33.042 --> 48:34.323
Tyrone.

48:34.586 --> 48:37.421
You silly, fat bastard.

48:38.924 --> 48:40.715
-Do you want to do it?
-That depends.

48:40.967 --> 48:41.916
On what?

48:42.177 --> 48:45.048
On you buying this caravan.

48:45.305 --> 48:47.678
Not the rouge one. The rose.

48:48.225 --> 48:50.431
-It's not the same caravan.
-Not the same fight.

48:50.686 --> 48:52.643
It's twice the size of the last one.

48:52.896 --> 48:55.851
The fight is twice the size.
And me ma needs a caravan.

48:56.108 --> 48:59.062
I like to look after me ma.
It's a fair deal. Take it.

48:59.320 --> 49:03.234
You're lucky we aren't worm food
after your last performance.

49:03.699 --> 49:06.819
Buying a tart's mobile palace
is a little fucking rich.

49:09.706 --> 49:12.707
I wasn't calling your mum a tart.
I just meant....

49:13.043 --> 49:15.249
Save your breath for cooling
your porridge.

49:23.262 --> 49:27.390
Right. And she's terrible
partial to the periwinkle blue.

49:29.643 --> 49:31.054
Have I made myself clear?

49:33.147 --> 49:35.519
Yeah, that's perfectly clear, Mickey.

49:35.858 --> 49:39.061
Just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague.

49:43.741 --> 49:45.948
Did you understand a word
of what he said?

49:48.788 --> 49:49.986
I'll tell you what.

49:51.791 --> 49:52.906
Fucker.

49:53.501 --> 49:54.996
I'll bet you for it.

49:55.587 --> 49:56.583
You'll what?

49:56.838 --> 49:58.119
He'll bet you for it.

49:58.673 --> 50:01.628
What, like Tommy did last time?
Do me a favour?

50:01.885 --> 50:03.344
I'll do you a favour.

50:03.595 --> 50:06.265
You have first bet.
If I win, I get a caravan...

50:06.515 --> 50:08.591
...and the boys get
a pair of them shoes.

50:10.728 --> 50:12.471
If I lose...

50:14.690 --> 50:17.691
...fuck it, I'll do the fight
for free.

50:19.612 --> 50:22.483
The last thing I really
want to do is bet a pikey.

50:22.740 --> 50:24.863
However, I don't really
have much of a choice.

50:25.535 --> 50:28.738
Somehow I've got to get him to fight,
but if I lose....

50:28.997 --> 50:32.081
Well, I don't even want
to think about losing.

50:32.709 --> 50:36.327
Okay. I reckon the hare gets fucked.

50:36.588 --> 50:38.545
What? Proper fucked?

50:40.842 --> 50:42.503
You got that, London?

50:42.761 --> 50:43.757
We're on!

51:56.004 --> 51:58.839
I'll fucking tell you!
Get those off me.

51:59.508 --> 52:01.216
I'll tell you
who robbed your bookies.

52:18.277 --> 52:20.947
Periwinkle blue. Bye, boys.

52:22.949 --> 52:25.321
Who's proper fucked now, then?

52:27.037 --> 52:29.160
There's something very wrong
with this.

52:29.456 --> 52:32.659
It was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him.

52:33.502 --> 52:38.045
Well, why didn't you '' bust a cap
in his ass'' then, Tommy?

52:38.590 --> 52:41.757
Mind you, you'd do more damage
if you threw it at him.

52:42.011 --> 52:44.502
What? You saying I can't shoot?

52:44.763 --> 52:48.298
Oh, no, Tommy.
I wasn't saying you can't shoot.

52:48.601 --> 52:50.392
I know you can't shoot.

52:50.686 --> 52:54.980
What we're saying is, that piece
of shit stuck in your trousers...

52:55.274 --> 52:57.184
...would do more damage
if you fed it to him.

52:57.443 --> 52:58.938
You saying the gun don't work?

52:59.237 --> 53:00.517
You tried it?

53:05.994 --> 53:06.824
Whoops.

53:09.331 --> 53:12.367
I want to see
that sneaky fucking Russian.

53:12.834 --> 53:15.290
Why's he got a tea cosy on his head?

53:15.587 --> 53:17.461
To keep his head warm.

53:17.715 --> 53:20.170
-What happened to him?
-He got shot in the face.

53:20.426 --> 53:21.837
I thought that was obvious.

53:22.094 --> 53:24.419
What'd you do that for?
You mistake him for a rabbit?

53:24.680 --> 53:27.136
-What do you want me to do?
-Sort it out.

53:27.391 --> 53:30.227
-I'm not a witch doctor.
-But you are a bad boy yardie...

53:30.478 --> 53:33.313
...and bad boy yardies should know how
to get rid of bodies.

53:33.564 --> 53:36.316
I create the bodies,
I don't erase the bodies.

53:43.158 --> 53:44.403
We're in, governor.

53:46.453 --> 53:48.244
Goody gumdrops.

53:48.580 --> 53:50.869
Get us a cup of tea,
would you, Errol?

53:52.751 --> 53:53.747
Grab hold of his legs.

53:54.002 --> 53:56.873
What do you think
I'm gonna grab him by, his ears?

54:07.350 --> 54:09.971
Hope this is not a bad moment.

54:14.899 --> 54:16.180
Do you know who I am?

54:18.695 --> 54:20.023
I do.

54:27.120 --> 54:30.157
Good. That will save me
some time, then.

54:31.875 --> 54:33.370
Well, I don't.

54:41.135 --> 54:45.596
You're always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece.

54:46.015 --> 54:48.008
Apparently, the best thing to do...

54:48.309 --> 54:52.936
...is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together.

54:53.857 --> 54:56.430
Would someone mind telling me,
who are you?

54:56.693 --> 54:59.610
When you got your six pieces,
you gotta get rid of them.

54:59.863 --> 55:03.314
It's no good leaving it in the freezer
for your mum to discover.

55:09.164 --> 55:12.699
Then I hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs.

55:14.294 --> 55:16.371
You gotta starve the pigs
for a few days...

55:16.630 --> 55:19.834
...then the chopped-up body
will look like curry to a pisshead.

55:21.385 --> 55:24.885
You gotta shave the heads of your
victims and pull the teeth out...

55:25.139 --> 55:26.931
...for the piggies' digestion.

55:27.225 --> 55:29.217
You could do this afterwards,
of course...

55:29.477 --> 55:31.885
...but you don't want
to sieve through pigshit, do you?

55:32.939 --> 55:36.771
They will go through bone like butter.

55:37.277 --> 55:41.061
You need at least 16 pigs
to finish the job in one sitting...

55:41.364 --> 55:45.314
...so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm.

55:45.577 --> 55:48.780
They will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds...

55:49.081 --> 55:50.955
...in about eight minutes.

55:51.208 --> 55:52.786
That means that a single pig...

55:53.085 --> 55:56.750
...can consume two pounds
of uncooked flesh...

55:57.047 --> 55:59.005
...every minute.

55:59.633 --> 56:01.591
Hence the expression...

56:01.844 --> 56:05.130
...''as greedy as a pig.''

56:08.977 --> 56:13.271
Well, thank you for that.
That's a great weight off me mind.

56:13.523 --> 56:16.690
Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me
who the fuck you are...

56:16.943 --> 56:19.814
...apart from someone who feeds people
to pigs, of course.

56:24.076 --> 56:25.985
Do you know what '' nemesis'' means?

56:30.374 --> 56:33.825
''A righteous infliction
of retribution...

56:34.128 --> 56:37.960
...manifested by an
appropriate agent.''

56:38.424 --> 56:43.382
Personified, in this case,
by a horrible cunt:

56:43.888 --> 56:45.299
Me.

56:53.148 --> 56:54.476
Gentlemen....

57:25.390 --> 57:27.963
Why can't you find me Franky, Doug?

57:28.309 --> 57:32.770
Avi, what do you want me to do?
I'm not a bounty hunter.

57:34.482 --> 57:35.681
What about Tony?

57:35.942 --> 57:37.105
Bullet-Tooth Tony.

57:37.402 --> 57:38.232
Who's Bullet-Tooth--

57:38.487 --> 57:40.479
-Tony!
-You silly fuck.

57:40.739 --> 57:41.770
He's a liability.

57:42.032 --> 57:44.191
He'd find Moses and the burning bush.

57:44.451 --> 57:45.862
You are gonna die, Tony!

57:46.120 --> 57:49.323
He got shot six times,
had the bullets moulded into gold.

57:50.207 --> 57:51.951
I shoot you, you go down!

57:52.251 --> 57:55.003
He has two in his teeth
that Dad did, so he loves Dad.

57:56.088 --> 57:57.962
Why don't you fucking die?

57:58.216 --> 58:00.837
-He's the best chance you got.
-Six times?

58:02.428 --> 58:03.804
In one sitting.

58:04.597 --> 58:06.305
You're in trouble now.

58:07.976 --> 58:10.182
Sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?

58:22.825 --> 58:23.904
Bonjour.

58:27.371 --> 58:29.660
What's so fucking important?

58:29.915 --> 58:32.074
Why do you think
we've got a dead man...

58:32.334 --> 58:35.122
-...missing an arm in our office?
-Talk to me, tell me.

58:35.379 --> 58:37.171
You give us four days...

58:37.465 --> 58:41.083
...l'll get you a stone the size
of a fucking home. I kid you not.

58:41.344 --> 58:42.542
What do you think, Errol?

58:42.845 --> 58:46.012
I think we should drip-dry them,
while we got the chance.

58:46.266 --> 58:48.472
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.

58:48.768 --> 58:51.342
What have I told you about thinking?

58:51.980 --> 58:54.139
-You got 48 hours.
-Yeah.

58:54.399 --> 58:57.685
You can keep that silly, fat wanker.
The lads can't lift him.

58:57.945 --> 58:59.143
Forty-eight hours.

58:59.446 --> 59:00.857
After that it's your family...

59:01.156 --> 59:03.944
...and the pigs finish
what the dogs don't do.

59:06.287 --> 59:10.331
So, what should I call you?
Should I call you '' Bullet''? ''Tooth''?

59:10.583 --> 59:12.207
Call me ''Susan''
if it makes you happy.

59:12.460 --> 59:15.876
Tony, there is a man
I'd like you to find.

59:16.130 --> 59:19.795
That depends on all the elements
in the equation. How many are there?

59:20.051 --> 59:20.881
Forty thousand.

59:23.972 --> 59:25.596
Where was he last seen?

59:26.558 --> 59:27.423
At a bookies.

59:28.018 --> 59:29.346
Bookies?

59:31.646 --> 59:33.520
Pass us the blower, Susi.

59:37.569 --> 59:40.654
-Bookies got blagged last night.
-Blagged? Speak English.

59:40.906 --> 59:45.615
This country spawned the language,
and nobody seems to speak it.

59:45.911 --> 59:47.240
Blagged, robbed.

59:47.496 --> 59:49.822
We'll see a man
that may know something.

59:50.082 --> 59:51.826
I need a gun.

59:52.126 --> 59:55.163
You don't, Rosebud, me old son.
You need me.

59:57.715 --> 01:00:00.041
I got fucking black ink all
over fuck boy.

01:00:00.343 --> 01:00:02.383
He's stained for fucking life.

01:00:02.679 --> 01:00:05.348
That and the golden teeth as well.
Fucking hell--

01:00:05.598 --> 01:00:06.927
All right, Mullet?

01:00:11.897 --> 01:00:13.640
How you doing?
You all right, mate?

01:00:14.483 --> 01:00:15.811
Nice tie.

01:00:16.068 --> 01:00:17.692
I heard you weren't about that much.

01:00:17.945 --> 01:00:21.148
Still warm, the blood
that courses through my veins.

01:00:21.907 --> 01:00:23.567
Unlike yours, Mullet.

01:00:24.368 --> 01:00:25.946
Who blagged Brick Top's bookies?

01:00:26.245 --> 01:00:29.448
-Do me a favour, Tone.
-I will do you a favour, Mullet.

01:00:29.707 --> 01:00:33.456
I'll not bash the fuck out of you
in front of all your girlfriends.

01:00:34.379 --> 01:00:37.913
Gonna make it worth my while, mate?
Jesus, you know how it is, man.

01:00:42.178 --> 01:00:43.756
Comfortable, Mullet?

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.098
It's sadly ironic it's that tie
that's got you into this pickle.

01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:50.138
Now, you take all
the time you want, mate.

01:00:50.604 --> 01:00:52.431
What the fuck you doing, Tone?

01:00:52.689 --> 01:00:55.263
Driving down the street
with your head in my window.

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:59.526
-What you think I'm doing?
-Well, don't, Tone.

01:01:00.698 --> 01:01:02.607
You been using dog shit
for toothpaste?

01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:04.112
Slow down, Tone.

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:06.449
Slow down, Tony!

01:01:06.704 --> 01:01:09.242
I don't think so.
I think I'll speed up.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:12.743
Play some music if you like.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:16.034
I love this track.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.914
I want to know who blagged
Brick Top's bookies.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:21.625
Yes, Mullet?

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:27.309
I think it's two black guys that work
from a pawn shop in Smith Street.

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:29.344
Better not be telling me porky pies.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:34.977
I tell you, it's two black guys work
out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.

01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:37.607
It's very effective, Tony.

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:39.896
It's not too subtle, but effective.

01:01:41.574 --> 01:01:42.984
Are we taking him with us?

01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:53.366
It's the Russian.

01:01:54.504 --> 01:01:55.500
A Russian?

01:01:55.755 --> 01:01:58.377
To be technical he's an Uzbekistanian.

01:01:58.675 --> 01:02:03.171
Uzbekistanian? I've been dealing
with those sneaky Russian dogs.

01:02:04.097 --> 01:02:05.675
-Give me a name.
-Yurinov.

01:02:05.974 --> 01:02:07.303
Boris.

01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:09.393
-Boris The Blade?
-Yeah.

01:02:09.686 --> 01:02:12.522
As in Boris The Bullet-Dodger?

01:02:14.066 --> 01:02:16.438
Why do they call him
The Bullet-Dodger?

01:02:17.444 --> 01:02:19.817
Because he dodges bullets, Avi.

01:02:21.699 --> 01:02:24.700
He won't fight unless
we buy his mum a caravan...

01:02:24.952 --> 01:02:26.363
...and you nicked all our savings.

01:02:27.079 --> 01:02:31.077
In the quiet words
of the Virgin Mary, come again?

01:02:32.001 --> 01:02:35.869
He's a stubborn bastard. He said
he's got to look after his mum.

01:02:36.131 --> 01:02:38.456
-Are you taking the piss?
-What can I do?

01:02:38.717 --> 01:02:40.875
I can't make him do it, can I?

01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:44.256
You're not much good to me alive
are you, Turkish?

01:02:49.353 --> 01:02:53.303
He's a useless shite, that boy.
Punish him for me, Errol.

01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:56.856
I want that pikey to fight.

01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:24.589
Brick Top thought smashing up
our arcade...

01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:27.891
...might help me
to persuade Mickey to fight.

01:03:29.103 --> 01:03:31.060
And if that wasn't enough...

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.769
...he thought it would be
a good idea...

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.772
... to burn Mickey's mum's caravan.

01:03:38.487 --> 01:03:39.982
While she was asleep in it.

01:04:37.174 --> 01:04:39.250
Turkish, get your arse up.

01:04:39.968 --> 01:04:40.834
You lot...

01:04:41.553 --> 01:04:44.044
...follow me
and I'll fucking shoot you.

01:04:45.098 --> 01:04:47.969
Calm down, son. Behave yourself.

01:04:48.268 --> 01:04:52.183
I've got the gun, son.
I think it's you who should behave.

01:04:52.815 --> 01:04:53.846
What?

01:04:54.608 --> 01:04:56.981
You want to see
if I've got the minerals?

01:05:15.755 --> 01:05:17.084
Jesus.

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:18.799
Sorry, Mickey.

01:05:20.177 --> 01:05:21.505
Did you do it?

01:05:26.642 --> 01:05:28.184
Then what are you sorry for?

01:05:29.353 --> 01:05:31.809
-What are you two doing here?
-Come back!

01:05:32.064 --> 01:05:34.899
-You got some tars on you.
-Fuck off, Darren.

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.188
Fuck off!

01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:46.368
How silly do I feel?

01:05:46.871 --> 01:05:49.493
His mum is still smoking
next to us...

01:05:49.749 --> 01:05:51.789
...and I'm asking him to fight.

01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:55.791
I'll do the fight before he causes
any more carnage.

01:05:56.423 --> 01:05:58.214
And if he'd said no...

01:05:58.508 --> 01:06:00.881
... it could've been
a shite sight worse.

01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:08.393
Russians.

01:06:13.858 --> 01:06:15.233
Russians.

01:06:15.526 --> 01:06:16.937
I should've known.

01:06:17.195 --> 01:06:21.109
Anti-Semite, slippery Cossack sluts.

01:06:21.366 --> 01:06:23.405
What do you know about this goyim?

01:06:24.035 --> 01:06:25.660
Ex-KGB cancer.

01:06:26.371 --> 01:06:28.577
He was a highly trained
undercover agent.

01:06:28.832 --> 01:06:31.204
He'll be impossible to track down.

01:06:32.127 --> 01:06:33.123
Yeah.

01:06:33.378 --> 01:06:36.997
There's a strange man who wants
to sell us an 84-carat stone.

01:06:37.257 --> 01:06:39.795
-Where's he from?
-I don't know. Hard to tell.

01:06:40.052 --> 01:06:41.332
He's got a thick Russian accent.

01:06:53.983 --> 01:06:58.313
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He set the dogs on me. Look.

01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:02.529
That sneaky fucking Russian!
No wonder he didn't want to do it.

01:07:02.784 --> 01:07:05.240
First things first. One of us...

01:07:05.787 --> 01:07:10.663
...Tyrone, you go to the Russian's.
The second you see him, call us.

01:07:11.209 --> 01:07:12.324
Now.

01:07:18.175 --> 01:07:21.461
He's a right handful,
this fella, so watch out.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.840
I hate Russians.
I'll take care of him.

01:07:25.099 --> 01:07:26.759
All yours, Rosebud, old son.

01:07:27.727 --> 01:07:29.553
Not a problem.

01:07:31.397 --> 01:07:33.057
Get me to a doctor.

01:07:33.316 --> 01:07:36.103
Shoot that fuck!
Then, get me to a doctor.

01:07:36.402 --> 01:07:38.276
Okay, but first we get the stone.

01:07:38.529 --> 01:07:40.653
First the stone. Then a doctor.

01:07:40.907 --> 01:07:43.778
And not just any doctor, boychik.
A nice Jewish doctor.

01:07:44.035 --> 01:07:46.111
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!

01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:52.872
Get his keys
and find out where the stone is.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:57.547
-I think you got something to tell us.
-Take it easy, Rosebud.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.042
Do you want him to be able
to talk or not?

01:08:00.302 --> 01:08:02.674
What the fuck do you mean, replicas?

01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:06.513
They look the shit, don't they?
And nobody is gonna argue.

01:08:06.767 --> 01:08:09.437
I've got extra loud blanks,
just in case.

01:08:10.521 --> 01:08:13.308
In case we have
to deafen them to death?

01:08:18.779 --> 01:08:21.069
-Yeah.
-Boris is here.

01:08:21.323 --> 01:08:24.408
-We're coming over. Hold him there.
-Hold on!

01:08:24.661 --> 01:08:25.692
He's not on his own!

01:08:32.002 --> 01:08:33.200
We're off.

01:08:37.841 --> 01:08:40.296
Very industrious for a Cossack.

01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:51.385
Sneaky fucking Russian.

01:08:55.109 --> 01:08:56.104
So, where is he?

01:08:56.361 --> 01:08:58.982
It's not just he.
Three fellas went in the house.

01:08:59.238 --> 01:09:02.240
-They locked Boris in the car.
-Why didn't you tell us that?

01:09:03.952 --> 01:09:04.983
Did they look hard?

01:09:05.287 --> 01:09:06.448
They looked messy.

01:09:06.705 --> 01:09:09.540
-Let's get out of here.
-What about the Russian?

01:09:09.832 --> 01:09:11.577
I want you to bury him.

01:09:12.211 --> 01:09:13.206
All right.

01:09:14.921 --> 01:09:17.127
I think we should get you a new gun.

01:09:17.424 --> 01:09:19.298
But this time, try it.

01:09:19.593 --> 01:09:21.502
How far to the Russian's?

01:09:21.761 --> 01:09:23.304
Be there in a minute.

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:31.720
-Come on, then.
-No, no, not so fast, Vinny.

01:09:31.981 --> 01:09:34.899
We can't take them now.
We're gonna have to follow them.

01:09:36.569 --> 01:09:39.024
You shouldn't drink
that stuff, anyway.

01:09:39.322 --> 01:09:40.863
Why? What's wrong with it?

01:09:41.116 --> 01:09:44.033
-It's not in sync with evolution.
-Shut up.

01:09:44.286 --> 01:09:45.661
How do we get rid of him?

01:09:45.912 --> 01:09:48.319
-Do you want to shoot him?
-It's a little noisy.

01:09:48.582 --> 01:09:51.453
-Do you want to stab him?
-That's a little cold-blooded.

01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:55.245
-Do you want to kill him or not?
-I'll cut him. I got a blade.

01:09:55.506 --> 01:09:56.881
That's the spirit.

01:09:57.132 --> 01:09:58.591
Do they fire?

01:09:58.884 --> 01:10:00.047
Of course they fire.

01:10:00.302 --> 01:10:02.425
But how do you know?
They're replicas.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.637
What do you know about replicas?

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.977
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?

01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:13.389
You wanted to know
whether they worked.

01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:18.442
I didn't mean try it in the car,
Sol, you arsehole!

01:10:18.738 --> 01:10:21.229
What are you gonna do with that,
pick his teeth?

01:10:21.491 --> 01:10:25.156
Wipe the butter off and put it away.
There's a proper blade back there.

01:10:25.412 --> 01:10:28.781
Cows have only been domesticated
in the last 8000 years.

01:10:29.041 --> 01:10:31.496
Before, they were running
around mad as lorries.

01:10:31.752 --> 01:10:35.797
The human digestive system hasn't
got used to any dairy products yet.

01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:38.925
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

01:10:39.176 --> 01:10:41.086
Let me do you a favour.

01:10:46.225 --> 01:10:47.221
Whoops.

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:48.888
You. Want a knife?

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:51.268
No, not me.
I wouldn't know what to do.

01:10:51.523 --> 01:10:53.681
It's a knife, for God's sake.

01:10:53.942 --> 01:10:56.231
What's kept your fork company
all these years?

01:10:56.528 --> 01:10:59.778
The sharp side, the blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.211
Is that Boris?

01:11:41.158 --> 01:11:43.827
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?

01:11:45.245 --> 01:11:46.621
What about Rosebud?

01:11:46.872 --> 01:11:49.707
Well, you can bring him
with you if you like.

01:11:51.085 --> 01:11:52.544
But which bit would you like?

01:11:57.091 --> 01:11:58.087
They're getting out.

01:11:59.218 --> 01:12:01.341
Get down and follow them.

01:12:01.637 --> 01:12:03.595
Cover yourself up, Avi.

01:12:03.848 --> 01:12:05.176
You're making a scene.

01:12:05.475 --> 01:12:08.013
I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.

01:12:08.686 --> 01:12:11.522
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

01:12:11.815 --> 01:12:13.226
I can't leave him in here, can I?

01:12:20.324 --> 01:12:22.281
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

01:12:23.911 --> 01:12:27.861
I thought you wanted to get
cleaned up. Bathroom's back there.

01:12:28.207 --> 01:12:31.825
-He's left the door open.
-Shouldn't think that's a good idea.

01:12:32.086 --> 01:12:33.461
Should we go in?

01:12:33.713 --> 01:12:37.164
I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.

01:12:37.466 --> 01:12:41.464
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

01:12:41.763 --> 01:12:45.179
He's got as many of these nuts
as he has those nuts.

01:12:45.517 --> 01:12:48.304
I don't care if
he's got fucking hazelnuts.

01:12:48.603 --> 01:12:52.268
I want a gun that works,
and I'm gonna tell him.

01:12:52.899 --> 01:12:56.564
My God, Tommy, you certainly
got those minerals.

01:12:56.862 --> 01:13:00.527
Well, come on, then
before ''zee'' Germans get here.

01:13:00.782 --> 01:13:02.989
You just tell him who's in charge.

01:13:08.999 --> 01:13:10.197
Boris--

01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:16.752
You certainly told him.

01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:25.764
The Drowning Trout.

01:13:27.852 --> 01:13:29.228
Come and pick us up.

01:13:29.521 --> 01:13:30.552
And Doug...

01:13:31.731 --> 01:13:33.274
...sharpish.

01:13:53.546 --> 01:13:56.381
I don't want a fuss or to put
a bullet in your face...

01:13:56.674 --> 01:14:00.209
...but unless you give me what
I want there will be fucking murders.

01:14:03.139 --> 01:14:04.005
What's your name?

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:05.882
Shoot him.

01:14:13.233 --> 01:14:16.898
Let go of the gun!

01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:26.196
So, you're obviously the big dick...

01:14:27.039 --> 01:14:29.826
...and that, on either side of you,
are your balls.

01:14:30.918 --> 01:14:32.958
There are two types of balls:

01:14:33.713 --> 01:14:37.627
There are big brave balls,
and there are little faggot balls.

01:14:37.884 --> 01:14:40.375
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:43.177
Dicks have drive
and clarity of vision...

01:14:44.432 --> 01:14:45.974
...but they're not clever.

01:14:46.476 --> 01:14:49.561
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

01:14:50.522 --> 01:14:53.725
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy...

01:14:54.067 --> 01:14:57.234
...and have brought your
two little faggot balls along...

01:14:57.529 --> 01:15:00.945
...for a good old time. But
you've got your parties muddled up.

01:15:02.701 --> 01:15:04.244
There's no pussy here...

01:15:05.287 --> 01:15:08.739
...just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.

01:15:09.458 --> 01:15:11.118
Like a prick...

01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:13.712
...you're having second thoughts.

01:15:14.756 --> 01:15:16.547
You're shrinking.

01:15:17.467 --> 01:15:20.136
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

01:15:21.304 --> 01:15:24.969
The fact that you've got '' Replica''
written on the side of your gun...

01:15:29.896 --> 01:15:34.393
...and the fact that
I've got '' Desert Eagle .50'' ...

01:15:37.112 --> 01:15:38.904
...written on the side of mine...

01:15:43.702 --> 01:15:45.576
...should precipitate...

01:15:46.747 --> 01:15:50.579
...your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:53.916
Now...

01:15:56.716 --> 01:15:58.091
...fuck off.

01:16:13.567 --> 01:16:15.026
Lock the door.

01:16:15.319 --> 01:16:16.564
Lock it!

01:16:22.493 --> 01:16:23.738
Give me the case.

01:16:24.578 --> 01:16:26.121
Fuck you.

01:16:27.123 --> 01:16:28.119
Shoot me.

01:16:28.499 --> 01:16:30.539
I will. I'll shoot you.

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:43.597
Pass me case or I shoot you.

01:16:44.641 --> 01:16:46.135
You know what?

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:47.430
Fuck you too.

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:51.347
Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be doing
me a favour, you Russian fuck.

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:54.312
You! Drop guns.

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:55.809
Fuck you!

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.063
You drop your gun!

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:00.646
Okay.

01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:02.655
Avi...

01:17:03.077 --> 01:17:04.073
...pull your socks up!

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:20.918
-Tyrone?
-Fuck it. We're out of here.

01:17:22.097 --> 01:17:23.639
Give me case.

01:17:36.362 --> 01:17:37.560
Avi...

01:17:38.531 --> 01:17:40.737
-...where's the case?
-Put the gun away.

01:17:42.326 --> 01:17:43.986
What's Boris doing here?

01:17:45.204 --> 01:17:47.161
Boris, what are you doing here?

01:17:47.415 --> 01:17:49.372
Fuck you!

01:17:57.968 --> 01:17:59.378
Where's the case?

01:18:00.846 --> 01:18:03.419
-You piece of crap.
-Don't take the piss, Boris.

01:18:03.682 --> 01:18:05.840
I'll show you.

01:18:09.396 --> 01:18:10.974
Fuck you!

01:18:14.944 --> 01:18:17.020
Almost had it.

01:18:17.321 --> 01:18:19.113
For fuck's sake.

01:18:23.327 --> 01:18:25.285
Fuck you and all.

01:18:26.956 --> 01:18:29.661
You lucky bastard.

01:18:35.507 --> 01:18:37.914
Jeez, it's flawless.

01:18:38.593 --> 01:18:41.381
Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.

01:18:41.722 --> 01:18:43.002
Leave the dog here.

01:18:43.265 --> 01:18:47.892
-Sol, why don't we just leave?
-Because life's too short, Vincent...

01:18:48.145 --> 01:18:50.980
...and it'll get a lot shorter
if Brick Top wishes.

01:18:51.273 --> 01:18:54.642
-Now leave that dog here.
-I'm gonna leave the dog here.

01:18:54.902 --> 01:18:55.684
Don't worry about it!

01:18:55.945 --> 01:18:59.729
And if that pikey mutt does
any damage, you're gonna pay.

01:19:01.534 --> 01:19:02.364
It's okay.

01:19:03.411 --> 01:19:05.154
Sit down. Down.

01:19:10.043 --> 01:19:13.127
I don't want to go in there.
You'll never see me again.

01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:15.622
Well, we won't if you don't.

01:19:16.383 --> 01:19:18.459
All right, you give me the stone...

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:22.628
...and I will give it
to Brick Top. Yeah?

01:19:22.931 --> 01:19:26.976
All right. Give me a minute.
It's a bit fiddly.

01:19:30.814 --> 01:19:31.977
Why is it down there?

01:19:33.067 --> 01:19:36.021
Well, I put it down there
in case we got mugged.

01:19:36.278 --> 01:19:38.070
You ain't from this planet, are you?

01:19:38.531 --> 01:19:42.280
Who is gonna mug two black fellas
holding pistols...

01:19:42.535 --> 01:19:46.236
...sat in a car that's worth less
than your shirt?

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:52.831
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend,
Desert Eagle .50.

01:19:53.213 --> 01:19:55.585
What have they got to do
with anything?

01:19:55.882 --> 01:19:58.041
They're both staring straight at me.

01:20:01.179 --> 01:20:05.427
You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

01:20:05.809 --> 01:20:06.841
Now, out of the car.

01:20:07.394 --> 01:20:09.434
And leave your water pistols behind.

01:20:10.356 --> 01:20:14.021
Look, just tell him the stone's back
at the office.

01:20:14.318 --> 01:20:15.860
I'll think of something.

01:20:20.616 --> 01:20:21.565
Why's he sweating?

01:20:23.953 --> 01:20:24.985
Oh, never mind.

01:20:25.288 --> 01:20:27.779
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?

01:20:28.041 --> 01:20:32.253
-I'm a little worried, actually.
-Worried about what?

01:20:33.004 --> 01:20:36.670
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

01:20:36.967 --> 01:20:38.841
I mean, he's done it before,
hasn't he?

01:20:39.136 --> 01:20:43.086
We get murdered before we leave the
building, and we get fed to the pigs.

01:20:44.099 --> 01:20:47.931
I'm glad to see you're climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety.

01:20:49.730 --> 01:20:53.775
Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.

01:20:54.068 --> 01:20:56.226
Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one.

01:20:56.487 --> 01:21:00.152
It's his mum's funeral tonight.
God bless her.

01:21:02.911 --> 01:21:05.781
You know those gypsies
like a drink at a wake.

01:21:06.039 --> 01:21:09.490
I'm not worried about whether Mickey
knocks the other man out.

01:21:09.751 --> 01:21:12.788
I'm worried about whether he makes it
to the fourth round.

01:21:13.046 --> 01:21:15.668
What if he doesn't make it
to the fourth round?

01:21:15.924 --> 01:21:18.249
We get murdered before leaving
the building...

01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:21.714
...and I imagine we get fed
to the pigs.

01:21:23.891 --> 01:21:25.848
So why are you so calm?

01:21:26.852 --> 01:21:29.094
-I said--
-I heard what you said, Tommy!

01:21:29.814 --> 01:21:32.519
It's not as though we've got a choice,
now, is it?

01:21:32.775 --> 01:21:35.812
You show me how to control
a wild fucking gypsy...

01:21:36.112 --> 01:21:40.573
...and I'll show you how to control
an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.

01:21:41.743 --> 01:21:44.316
Bollocks! I'm going for a walk.

01:22:24.287 --> 01:22:25.865
Oh, that fucking dog!

01:22:27.332 --> 01:22:28.874
Go on, get the dog.

01:22:29.793 --> 01:22:33.043
-It's a bit funky in here, isn't it?
-Open a window.

01:22:41.263 --> 01:22:43.470
You people live like animals.

01:22:44.016 --> 01:22:45.676
Now, where's the stone?

01:22:45.976 --> 01:22:48.135
-Come on, where is it?
-It's over here.

01:22:48.396 --> 01:22:51.480
-Where? Where?
-I left it in a box.

01:22:56.821 --> 01:22:57.735
It's empty.

01:22:57.989 --> 01:23:01.073
I'm getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.

01:23:02.035 --> 01:23:04.111
No, I'm being serious!

01:23:04.371 --> 01:23:06.826
The dog. The dog must have had it.

01:23:10.585 --> 01:23:14.002
Now then, let's have a look,
shall we? Tony.

01:23:15.382 --> 01:23:17.956
-What?
-Look in the dog.

01:23:19.511 --> 01:23:22.299
-You mean, '' look in the dog''?
-I mean, open him up.

01:23:26.727 --> 01:23:29.978
It's not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, open him up?

01:23:30.231 --> 01:23:32.224
You know what I mean.

01:23:34.819 --> 01:23:35.815
That's a bit strong.

01:23:37.822 --> 01:23:38.854
I don't know about this.

01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:42.110
No, you can't do this.

01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:46.205
It's fucking squeaking!

01:23:46.456 --> 01:23:50.537
You never heard a dog squeak before?
Give me that goddamn gun!

01:23:53.172 --> 01:23:54.832
I'm shooting the dog!

01:24:03.099 --> 01:24:04.723
Shoot the fucking dog!

01:24:15.570 --> 01:24:18.275
You sneaky fucking bastard.

01:24:30.294 --> 01:24:31.289
Thank God for that.

01:24:41.806 --> 01:24:45.091
I hate fucking dogs!
Come on, Tony.

01:24:48.062 --> 01:24:49.722
Tony, come on!

01:24:58.073 --> 01:24:59.318
Tony?

01:25:11.545 --> 01:25:14.297
-Anything to declare?
-Yeah. Don't go to England.

01:25:17.009 --> 01:25:20.841
That dog is gonna go back
to the campsite. It always does.

01:25:21.138 --> 01:25:23.178
How's the dog gonna find the campsite?

01:25:23.474 --> 01:25:25.681
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?

01:25:25.977 --> 01:25:28.894
All right. But we have
to wait until it gets light.

01:25:29.147 --> 01:25:31.056
And we have to get rid
of these bodies.

01:25:31.316 --> 01:25:34.601
That one with the tea cosy
on his head's starting to stink.

01:25:34.903 --> 01:25:39.980
Right. Let's stick them in the car,
and then go and look for a pig farm.

01:25:43.203 --> 01:25:44.532
Mickey.

01:25:46.623 --> 01:25:47.738
Mickey!

01:25:50.419 --> 01:25:52.246
You feeling all right, Mickey?

01:25:55.132 --> 01:25:56.247
Need a drink.

01:25:59.011 --> 01:26:00.387
You can't give him a drink!

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.637
It's not for him. It's for me.

01:26:08.271 --> 01:26:10.264
Ah, mates. Amen.

01:26:17.239 --> 01:26:21.699
He's a hard bastard, this Good Night
Anderson, so pay attention.

01:26:22.703 --> 01:26:24.078
All right, Mickey?

01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:26.158
Mickey!

01:26:30.628 --> 01:26:32.419
Need to have a shite!

01:26:33.589 --> 01:26:38.335
If you see the pikey, Turkish or
his girlfriend come out before me...

01:26:38.594 --> 01:26:40.670
...shoot the bastards.

01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:45.464
Well, come on.
We got a fight to go to.

01:26:52.567 --> 01:26:53.943
All right, Tom.

01:26:54.903 --> 01:26:59.031
-Hope we get a better show this time.
-This will make up for it.

01:26:59.282 --> 01:27:01.571
Mickey's going down in the fourth.

01:27:01.827 --> 01:27:04.318
Terry over there is in charge
of the bets.

01:27:04.621 --> 01:27:06.246
Now, you have to forgive me.

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:09.114
I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.

01:27:12.379 --> 01:27:15.334
-Our lads at the campsite?
-They're over there now.

01:27:18.636 --> 01:27:20.878
I fucking hate pikeys.

01:27:22.890 --> 01:27:26.935
-How long have we gotta stay here?
-As long as it takes. Now, shut up.

01:27:28.021 --> 01:27:29.978
Fucking hate pikeys.

01:27:31.149 --> 01:27:33.106
Is he fucking stoned?

01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:35.603
He's like that before a fight.

01:27:35.904 --> 01:27:38.229
Do you know when you're going down?

01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:41.028
Of course he knows
when he's going down.

01:27:41.285 --> 01:27:45.532
Fuck-face, who's speaking to you?
He asked him, didn't he?

01:27:45.831 --> 01:27:48.405
Fuck-face? I like that one, Errol.

01:27:48.667 --> 01:27:51.040
I'll remember that next time
I climb off your mum.

01:27:51.295 --> 01:27:54.629
-Not now.
-Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:57.711
Be a nice one.
Hell of a way to be a war.

01:27:57.969 --> 01:27:59.428
And there none a yours.

01:28:00.763 --> 01:28:04.631
There's a camp full of pikeys
that might not think you're so funny.

01:28:04.893 --> 01:28:08.178
Not when they're putting out flames
on their children's backs.

01:28:09.731 --> 01:28:11.605
Now get up and have a fucking fight.

01:28:17.656 --> 01:28:21.107
Three rounds and you're a vegetable,
aren't you, pikey!

01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:14.665
I'm in charge here.
No fucking about, no eye-gouging.

01:29:14.924 --> 01:29:17.083
Do your worst. Let's get it on!

01:29:48.584 --> 01:29:51.371
What the fuck's going on?
You gonna finish him or what?

01:30:33.673 --> 01:30:35.297
Talk about saved by the bell.

01:30:35.842 --> 01:30:39.425
Do you understand the consequences
of knocking that man out?

01:30:39.721 --> 01:30:41.963
Do not knock him out, Mickey.

01:30:48.605 --> 01:30:50.313
All right, let's break it up.

01:31:24.351 --> 01:31:25.762
What, is he fucking deaf?

01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:28.972
What is he doing?

01:31:44.747 --> 01:31:46.075
Come on and sit.

01:31:48.918 --> 01:31:50.875
What the fuck are you doing, Mickey?

01:31:51.129 --> 01:31:53.205
You're dancing like a fairy.

01:31:53.506 --> 01:31:56.128
They'll hang us
if they think it's rigged.

01:31:56.926 --> 01:31:59.049
Get out there and hurt him.

01:32:00.472 --> 01:32:05.348
But for fuck's sake,
do not knock him out.

01:33:25.686 --> 01:33:28.556
All he's got to do is stay down.

01:33:33.152 --> 01:33:35.310
Now, we are fucked.

01:33:43.621 --> 01:33:44.570
He can't stand up.

01:33:44.831 --> 01:33:45.577
We're out of here.

01:33:45.873 --> 01:33:50.951
Stupid pikey knows Brick Top's got
keen-to-kill monkeys with shotguns...

01:33:51.212 --> 01:33:53.668
...sitting outside his campsite.

01:33:54.007 --> 01:33:58.883
Once the campsite's wiped out,
I know it's gonna be the same for us.

01:34:01.556 --> 01:34:03.383
Ever cross the road
and look the wrong way?

01:34:03.642 --> 01:34:05.101
Give me that fucking shooter!

01:34:05.394 --> 01:34:08.015
And, hey, presto,
there's a car nearly on you.

01:34:08.313 --> 01:34:09.428
So, what do you do?

01:34:10.065 --> 01:34:12.141
Something very silly.

01:34:12.526 --> 01:34:15.397
You freeze. And your life
doesn't flash before you...

01:34:15.654 --> 01:34:18.146
...because you're too scared
to think.

01:34:18.449 --> 01:34:21.486
You just freeze
and pull a stupid face.

01:34:21.786 --> 01:34:23.992
But the pikey didn't. Why?

01:34:24.247 --> 01:34:27.034
Because he had plans
on running the car over.

01:34:29.461 --> 01:34:31.537
It had previously occurred to me...

01:34:31.838 --> 01:34:35.088
... that he'd taken the demise
of his mother rather lightly.

01:34:38.303 --> 01:34:41.008
For every action,
there is a reaction.

01:34:41.306 --> 01:34:43.180
And a pikey reaction...

01:34:43.892 --> 01:34:45.221
... is quite a fucking thing.

01:35:27.271 --> 01:35:29.311
Pete, talk to me.

01:35:29.565 --> 01:35:33.148
If you want your friend to hear you,
talk a lot louder than that.

01:35:42.161 --> 01:35:45.696
-Give me that fucking shooter.
-I'll give you your shooter, you cunt.

01:35:53.757 --> 01:35:57.375
That is when I thought the pikey
had money riding on himself.

01:35:58.428 --> 01:36:01.928
That's why the bastard never
goes down when he's supposed to.

01:36:03.726 --> 01:36:05.469
We've been tucked up...

01:36:07.146 --> 01:36:08.724
... while he's been cleaning up.

01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:13.473
We're worse off now than
when we started.

01:36:18.992 --> 01:36:21.399
The next day we went
to the campsite...

01:36:21.703 --> 01:36:24.823
...but the gypsies had disappeared
during the night.

01:36:25.081 --> 01:36:27.038
Which was probably a good thing...

01:36:27.334 --> 01:36:31.711
... considering they'd just buried
12 people somewhere in the area.

01:36:32.047 --> 01:36:33.375
Where is he?

01:36:33.674 --> 01:36:35.750
He ain't fucking here,
that's for sure.

01:36:36.593 --> 01:36:40.093
We can't ask a man to fight for us
if we can't find him, can we?

01:36:40.347 --> 01:36:43.597
You won't find a pikey that
doesn't want to be found.

01:36:45.811 --> 01:36:49.015
He could be in a campsite
in Kampu-fucking-chea by now.

01:36:50.608 --> 01:36:52.399
Bollocks! Come on.

01:36:57.699 --> 01:37:00.486
-What you doing here?
-What's it got to do with you?

01:37:04.414 --> 01:37:06.537
So, what you doing here?

01:37:14.174 --> 01:37:17.009
I'm taking the dog for a walk.
What's the problem?

01:37:18.721 --> 01:37:19.586
What's in the car?

01:37:20.306 --> 01:37:21.800
Seats and a steering wheel.

01:37:22.975 --> 01:37:24.766
What do you know about gypsies?

01:37:26.562 --> 01:37:28.519
I know they're not to be trusted.

01:37:30.608 --> 01:37:33.277
All right, get your dog. On your way.

01:37:34.153 --> 01:37:35.648
Get the dog, Tommy.

01:37:37.532 --> 01:37:38.777
The dog.

01:37:40.368 --> 01:37:44.829
All right, boy. Come on.
Come on, Daisy. No, Daisy!

01:37:45.582 --> 01:37:47.242
He loves that dog.

01:37:47.626 --> 01:37:49.334
Always playing silly games.

01:37:49.586 --> 01:37:52.955
Stop messing about
and get it in the car. Tommy!

01:37:54.842 --> 01:37:59.587
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy, Daisy, good boy.

01:38:10.399 --> 01:38:11.894
Could you tell me...

01:38:12.193 --> 01:38:15.396
...why you got a dead man
with an arm missing in your boot?

01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:17.026
Hey, George...

01:38:18.450 --> 01:38:20.608
...is that a tea cosy on his head?

01:38:24.039 --> 01:38:26.446
Oh, you love a dog, don't you, Tommy?

01:38:36.385 --> 01:38:38.923
Tommy persuaded me to keep the dog.

01:38:39.179 --> 01:38:42.798
I eventually agreed,
as long as he took it to a vet.

01:38:43.059 --> 01:38:45.514
I couldn't stand
that squeaking anymore.

01:38:45.811 --> 01:38:49.145
The vet found half an undigested
shoe, a squeaky toy...

01:38:49.398 --> 01:38:52.684
...and an 84-carat diamond
lodged in its stomach.

01:38:53.319 --> 01:38:55.810
It's quite amazing what can happen
in a week.

01:38:56.239 --> 01:38:58.196
Still didn't shut it up, though.

01:38:59.117 --> 01:39:00.944
So, what do you do?

01:39:01.244 --> 01:39:04.115
You go see the man that knows
about these sort of things.

01:39:04.372 --> 01:39:05.915
So, what do you think?

01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:09.868
Do you know anyone
who'd be interested?

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:15.630
I might.
