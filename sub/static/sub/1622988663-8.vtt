Eeek! Ooh!

09:15.132 --> 09:17.354
Oh, not again!
I mean, that--
that's pretty normal.

09:17.454 --> 09:19.715
I've seen that before.
What is happening here?

09:19.815 --> 09:21.677
We are being led
by a righteous man.

09:21.777 --> 09:23.799
Our trip should be
protected by God.

09:23.899 --> 09:25.240
I mean, nothing's changed,
right?

09:25.340 --> 09:26.881
You're still a completely
faultless man

09:26.981 --> 09:29.404
with nary a blemish of sin
on your perfect soul?

09:29.504 --> 09:30.845
Oh, yeah, sure am.
Totally.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.087
Squeaky clean Zekey
over here.

09:33.187 --> 09:35.188
Um, excuse me a moment.
Oh, yeah.

09:36.069 --> 09:38.771
Oh, hey, Zeke.
Crazy day, huh?

09:38.871 --> 09:40.933
Levi's having a bit
of a temper tantrum.

09:41.033 --> 09:42.775
[demon-voiced]
Salute Satanum!

09:42.875 --> 09:45.097
[continues speaking Latin]

09:45.197 --> 09:46.698
Now Levi, what did we say

09:46.798 --> 09:48.580
about praising Satan
in ancient Latin?

09:48.680 --> 09:50.741
[demon voice]
Shove it up your ass, bitch.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.623
[chuckles]
He's such a scamp.

09:52.723 --> 09:53.944
Are you not
the tiniest bit concerned

09:54.044 --> 09:55.545
that the sudden downturn
things have taken

09:55.645 --> 09:57.267
might be our doing?

09:57.367 --> 10:00.309
What do you mean?
I feel like God
is punishing us

10:00.409 --> 10:01.630
for the affair.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.272
Come on, not this again.

10:03.372 --> 10:04.793
I thought you said
you were over it.

10:04.893 --> 10:06.635
I thought I was,
but look around you.

10:06.735 --> 10:08.436
Things are not
going great right now.

10:08.536 --> 10:09.877
Everything's fine.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.198
You're just stuck
in your own head.

10:11.298 --> 10:12.880
So, the wagon's free
at lunch.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.282
What do you say I help you
get out of your head, huh?

10:15.382 --> 10:18.244
[roars]

10:18.344 --> 10:20.946
I should probably deal
with this, but come by later.

10:22.067 --> 10:23.729
[demon voice] Shove it
up your ass, bitch.

10:23.829 --> 10:25.210
You already said that one.

10:25.310 --> 10:27.372
[demon voice]
Oops. Sorry about that.

10:27.472 --> 10:30.695
My name is Gorgeous Pete,
and I'm a bandit.

10:30.795 --> 10:32.176
ALL: Hi, Gorgeous Pete.

10:32.276 --> 10:34.378
This is a painting
I made of myself.

10:34.478 --> 10:35.939
It's a scary outlaw.

10:36.039 --> 10:38.461
But that's not the real me
on the inside.

10:38.561 --> 10:39.982
I want to be a dancer.

10:40.082 --> 10:42.965
You don't have to be
that guy anymore. Let it go.

10:46.328 --> 10:47.389
All right,
who wants to go next?

10:47.489 --> 10:49.490
Uh, Trig?

10:50.251 --> 10:52.293
Sure. Um...

10:53.734 --> 10:56.316
This is a painting of me.

10:56.416 --> 10:58.838
As you can see, I'm
giving you the middle finger.

10:58.938 --> 11:00.760
[laughs] Okay.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.041
We have a hard case here,
don't we?

11:02.141 --> 11:04.763
I get it. I used
to be just like you.

11:04.863 --> 11:07.525
Every weekend
I was out robbing banks,

11:07.625 --> 11:09.727
sticking up stagecoaches,

11:09.827 --> 11:11.649
but I felt empty
on the inside.

11:11.749 --> 11:14.251
That is,
until I did the work

11:14.351 --> 11:16.573
and I became
the fully enlightened person

11:16.673 --> 11:17.974
that you see now.

11:18.074 --> 11:20.376
Oh, my God, I'm in hell.
This is hell.

11:20.476 --> 11:22.498
No, Trig.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.581
Why can't you achieve
the same level of growth as me?

11:25.681 --> 11:27.302
Because it's bullshit.

11:27.402 --> 11:30.465
One spiritual weekend retreat
does not change a lifetime

11:30.565 --> 11:32.386
of being a selfish asshole.

11:32.486 --> 11:35.389
Except in my case,
that's exactly what happened.

11:35.489 --> 11:36.630
Because I did the work.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.792
Stop saying
you did the work!

11:38.892 --> 11:40.633
What work?
What does that even mean?

11:40.733 --> 11:42.314
It's the work.
It's what I did.

11:42.414 --> 11:44.997
- Yeah, he did the work.
- Shut up, Kevin!

11:45.097 --> 11:46.638
Okay, all right, look,
why don't we move on

11:46.738 --> 11:48.199
to our Kundalini exercises?

11:48.299 --> 11:50.922
I think we need to release

11:51.022 --> 11:52.763
the negative energy
from our buttholes.

11:52.863 --> 11:55.085
All right, everybody up.
Come on.

11:55.185 --> 11:56.927
On your feet,
and bend over.

11:57.027 --> 11:58.288
- Yeah.
- [all groan]

11:58.388 --> 12:00.650
Loosen those hips.
Let it out.

12:00.750 --> 12:03.092
Hey, Zeke.
Sorry I'm late.

12:03.192 --> 12:05.334
There was a freak outbreak
of frogs.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.335
Honestly, it was
just more random than bad.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.616
Whoa.

♪♪ A-a-amen ♪♪

12:11.799 --> 12:15.662
- Oh, hey.
- Hey. You decorated.

12:15.762 --> 12:19.185
I thought our S-E-X
could use a little G-O-D?

12:19.285 --> 12:21.267
That way, we can continue
our affair

12:21.367 --> 12:23.469
and appease our vengeful
lord and saviour.

12:23.569 --> 12:26.752
Uh, I mean,
it's a little distracting

12:26.852 --> 12:28.673
but if it's what you need...

12:28.773 --> 12:30.915
First, we set the mood

12:31.015 --> 12:34.078
with a naughty little
sprinkle of holy water.

12:34.178 --> 12:35.839
Wow, you're really
using a lot.

12:35.939 --> 12:36.820
Yeah. Make sure to get some
on your face.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.762
[sputters]
Uh...very nice.

12:38.862 --> 12:40.643
And can I interest my lady

12:40.743 --> 12:43.365
in a taste of bitter ashes?

12:43.465 --> 12:44.927
Maybe we can just skip
to the part

12:45.027 --> 12:46.808
where we make out?
Of course.

12:46.908 --> 12:50.171
And I have the perfect thing
for that.

12:50.271 --> 12:51.973
What?
What is that?

12:52.073 --> 12:53.934
Just a little contraption
I built.

12:54.034 --> 12:55.255
The hammer will continuously

12:55.355 --> 12:57.297
strike me in the testicles
as we kiss,

12:57.397 --> 13:00.340
thereby removing all pleasure
from the sexual experience.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.702
- Shall we take it for a spin?
- Uh, are you sure?

13:02.802 --> 13:03.903
I don't think that's--

13:04.003 --> 13:05.464
[screams in pain]

13:05.564 --> 13:08.266
Oh, wow! That did damage!

13:08.366 --> 13:10.988
Oh, one blow
is utterly devastating!

13:11.088 --> 13:12.910
I can't imagine doing that
even once more,

13:13.010 --> 13:15.712
let alone for
an entire make-out session.

13:15.812 --> 13:16.953
Um, I'm sorry.
Can we stop?

13:17.053 --> 13:18.435
This isn't working for me.

13:18.535 --> 13:19.756
How's it supposed
to make me feel

13:19.856 --> 13:21.437
that you have to punish
yourself to be with me?

13:21.537 --> 13:23.399
It's just--it's the only thing
I've thought of

13:23.499 --> 13:25.501
to atone for our sins.

13:27.222 --> 13:29.044
but I need you
to be in it, too,

13:29.144 --> 13:30.965
and not think that
our relationship is a sin.

13:31.065 --> 13:33.047
I'm sorry. No, no, no, no.

13:33.147 --> 13:34.808
Of course, of course
I want to be with you.

13:34.908 --> 13:38.772
I--you're right.
I am being ridiculous

13:38.872 --> 13:40.093
and if you will
still have me,

13:40.193 --> 13:41.654
I'd like to make out with you
super hard right now.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.756
There we go.

14:05.574 --> 14:07.676
You taught us all
how to abandon

14:07.776 --> 14:09.878
our selfish ways.

14:09.978 --> 14:11.999
We'll all stick together

Dear Lord,
I repent my wicked ways.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.862
I committed the sin
of adultery with Prudence.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.503
- The hell?
- I was too weak

14:40.603 --> 14:42.625
to resist the temptation
of the harlot's flesh!

14:42.725 --> 14:44.867
She bewitched me with
her devilish charms,

14:44.967 --> 14:46.188
and ankles
that just won't quit!

14:46.288 --> 14:47.629
It was wicked and wrong,

14:47.729 --> 14:50.411
and I promise I will never
disobey you again, oh, Lord!

14:53.094 --> 14:55.276
Yes! Yes! It worked!
Thank you!

for your infinite mercy!

We're saved.

not particularly proud of.

But the main thing is

we are back on track

15:28.243 --> 15:29.384
- So--
- Enough!

15:29.484 --> 15:31.546
Why should we listen
to you anymore?

15:31.646 --> 15:34.468
You seduced me away
from my fellow Noonans

15:34.568 --> 15:37.671

with two backs with that wench.

You are not a righteous man,
Ezekiel Brown.
