WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:08.076
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.176 --> 00:12.146
IF THERE'S SOMEONE WHO DOES
NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF GUILT,
IT'S MY FATHER.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.815
MID-'50s, RIGHT?
JIM CROW, OKLAHOMA.

00:14.915 --> 00:17.685
THIS MOB WITH HOODS
ATTACKED HIS HOUSE.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.154
SO MY FATHER TAKES THE FAMILY,
THEY RUN DOWNSTAIRS

00:20.254 --> 00:22.690
TO THE-- THE BOILER ROOM,
TO THE BASEMENT.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.425
MY GRANDFATHER, HIS FATHER,

00:24.525 --> 00:27.561
WAS VERY SICK,
DYING OF LUNG CANCER.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.297
HE HAD THIS HACKING COUGH.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.233
MY FATHER PUTS HIS HAND OVER
HIS FATHER'S MOUTH AND NOSE

00:32.333 --> 00:34.868
AND HE KEPT IT THERE WHILE
THEY SEARCHED THE BASEMENT.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.904
KEPT IT CLAMPED TIGHT.

00:37.004 --> 00:38.972
AND THEN WHEN THEY
FINALLY CLEARED OUT...

00:39.073 --> 00:40.374
MY GRANDFATHER WAS DEAD.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.476
MAN, I'D LOVE
TO SEE HIM ON THIS COUCH.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.045
DOC, YOU'D HAVE
A FIELD DAY WITH HIM.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.122
I'M PAUL WESTON.
I WAS A FRIEND OF ALEX'S.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.090
MY DEEPEST
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.392
THANK YOU.
I-- I DON'T REMEMBER--

00:58.492 --> 01:00.628
YOU PLAYED
RACQUETBALL WITH HIM.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.744
( thunder rumbling )

01:19.913 --> 01:22.116
HELLO, EXCUSE ME.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.018
- HI.
- I'M SORRY.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.321
I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH
ONE OF THESE DOORS
WAS THE RIGHT ONE.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.724
THAT'S OKAY.
IT'S A TERRIBLE DAY.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.694
DIDN'T WANT TO KNOCK
ON YOUR RESIDENCE.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.330
NO PROBLEM.
THIS DOOR IS USUALLY
FOR PEOPLE WHO COME IN.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.098
AND THAT'S USUALLY
THE EXIT DOOR.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.468
BUT IT DOESN'T--
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.903
YOU HAVE AN ENTRY DOOR
AND AN EXIT DOOR?

01:43.003 --> 01:45.072
IT'S FOR PEOPLE'S PRIVACY.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.074
SOME PEOPLE
DON'T LIKE TO--

01:47.175 --> 01:48.942
THEY DON'T LIKE
TO RUN INTO EACH OTHER.

01:49.042 --> 01:51.812
ARE THEY ASHAMED?

01:51.912 --> 01:53.247
OH, NO.
NO NO NO.

01:53.347 --> 01:56.417
IT'S JUST-- IT'S
PROTOCOL REALLY.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.621
- WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE?
- NO, I'M A TEA MAN.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.523
- AH!
- BUT NO, NOTHING,
THANK YOU.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.125
- I'M FINE.
- PLEASE, SIT DOWN.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.964
I GOT A LOT
OF QUESTIONS.

02:11.064 --> 02:14.402
UH, I'M SURE YOU HAVE.
AND I HOPE THAT I CAN
ANSWER SOME OF THEM.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.504
ONE THING I DO HAVE
TO STRESS FROM THE OUTSET

02:16.604 --> 02:19.340
IS THAT ANYTHING
THAT IS SAID

02:19.440 --> 02:22.410
BETWEEN MYSELF
AND A PATIENT IN THIS ROOM...

02:23.577 --> 02:24.745
IS PRIVATE.

02:24.845 --> 02:28.316
- EVEN IF THE PATIENT IS DEAD?
- YES, EVEN THEN.

02:30.584 --> 02:33.954
WELL, I'M SURE WE'LL FIND
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT...

02:34.054 --> 02:38.459
SOMETHING TO HELP ME
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY SON.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.165
( theme music playing )

03:01.582 --> 03:05.018
YOU WEREN'T VERY FORTHCOMING
ABOUT WHO YOU WERE

03:05.118 --> 03:06.754
WHEN WE MET
AT THE SERVICES.

03:06.854 --> 03:10.190
A FRIEND, YOU SAID?
THAT'S HARDLY THE CASE.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.394
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT
TO BETRAY ALEX'S CONFIDENCE.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.129
DANIEL DIDN'T
HESITATE IN EXPLAINING

03:16.230 --> 03:19.400
EXACTLY WHAT YOUR
RELATIONSHIP TO ALEX WAS.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.470
HE'S VERY DIRECT-- DANIEL.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.838
- I LIKE THAT ABOUT HIM.
- WERE YOU SURPRISED TO HEAR

03:24.938 --> 03:26.674
THAT ALEX WAS IN THERAPY?

03:26.774 --> 03:30.444
THAT HE DIDN'T
TELL ME SURPRISED ME.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.314
- I MEAN, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
- WHY DO YOU THINK HE DIDN'T?

03:33.414 --> 03:35.516
WE'LL NEVER KNOW THE ANSWER
TO THAT, WILL WE?

03:37.084 --> 03:39.320
OR I WON'T.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.622
MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU DISCUSSED HERE.

03:46.494 --> 03:50.097
YOU KNOW,
IT ALWAYS PUZZLED ME,

03:50.197 --> 03:53.634
THE WHOLE PROCESS
HERE, YOU KNOW?

03:53.734 --> 03:57.070
I MEAN, THAT-- THAT A PERSON
IS IN THERAPY AT ALL

03:57.170 --> 04:00.007
OFTEN IS NEVER DISCUSSED--

04:00.107 --> 04:02.776
WHO THE DOCTOR IS,

04:02.876 --> 04:04.144
WHAT HE'S THERE FOR,

04:04.244 --> 04:06.680
HOW MUCH IT COST.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.749
FUNNY THING IS
THAT IT'S SECRECY

04:08.849 --> 04:10.183
OR MISUNDERSTANDINGS,

04:10.284 --> 04:12.019
THINGS NEVER SPOKEN

04:12.119 --> 04:14.422
THAT USUALLY LAND PEOPLE
IN THERAPY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

04:14.522 --> 04:17.124
- ISN'T THAT IRONIC?
- I DON'T THINK
IT'S ABOUT SECRECY.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.460
I THINK IT'S ABOUT
CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT

04:19.560 --> 04:21.995
WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME
AND FEEL SAFE

04:22.095 --> 04:24.565
TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.501
SAFER THAN WITH
THEIR LOVED ONES?

04:27.601 --> 04:31.104
SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY WHO'S
TOTALLY UNINVOLVED

04:31.204 --> 04:32.406
IN YOUR LIFE--
SOMEBODY OBJECTIVE.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.741
SOMEBODY WHO
HAS NO STAKE IN IT.

04:33.841 --> 04:37.711
YOU MEAN LIKE
A PROSTITUTE, HMM?

04:37.811 --> 04:41.515
SOMEONE WHO'S PAID
FOR THEIR INTIMACY
AND THEIR DISCRETION.

04:43.384 --> 04:46.186
A MAN SHOULD HAVE
SOMEONE TO TALK TO

04:46.286 --> 04:48.188
WHO CARES ABOUT HIM,

04:48.288 --> 04:51.091
NOT SOMEONE WHO
CHARGES BY THE HOUR.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.827
I REALLY DID CARE FOR ALEX.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.630
AND IF I HADN'T,

04:56.730 --> 04:58.999
I'D ACTUALLY BE
A PRETTY POOR THERAPIST.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.743
DO YOU THINK ALEX SPOKE
ABOUT THINGS IN THIS ROOM

05:09.843 --> 05:11.945
THAT HE NEVER...

05:12.045 --> 05:14.314
SPOKE TO ANYONE ELSE ABOUT?

05:14.415 --> 05:16.817
THAT IS USUALLY
THE CASE WITH PATIENTS.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.553
SO YOU PROBABLY KNOW
AS MUCH ABOUT HIM
AS ANYONE DID.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.790
DO YOU FEEL THAT
YOU KNEW YOUR SON WELL?

05:23.957 --> 05:25.659
I KNEW ALEX WHEN HE WAS...

05:25.759 --> 05:27.060
A LITTLE BOY.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.662
AND WHAT WAS HE LIKE THEN?

05:28.762 --> 05:30.564
WELL, HE WAS...

05:30.664 --> 05:32.232
QUIET.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.767
INTROSPECTIVE.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.703
DAYDREAMER.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.372
INVENTOR.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.040
DID HE EVER
MENTION THAT TO YOU?

05:40.140 --> 05:42.943
( laughs )
HE NEVER DID, NO.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.546
REALLY? HE--

05:45.646 --> 05:49.817
HE INVENTED THIS THING
FOR HIS MOTHER--

05:49.917 --> 05:53.220
A PAN THAT MADE FLIPPING
AN OMELET OVER VERY EASY.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.955
HE WORKED VERY HARD
ON THAT THING.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.324
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

05:57.425 --> 05:58.826
SO WHERE DID HE
GET THAT FROM?

05:58.926 --> 06:01.128
- WERE YOU AN INVENTOR?
- OH, NO.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.464
NO, MAN.
I WAS A KNUCKLEHEAD.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.232
MY FATHER
WAS AN INVENTOR.

06:05.332 --> 06:08.536
HE INVENTED THIS
KNIFE-SHARPENING MACHINE.

06:08.636 --> 06:12.039
IT DIDN'T MAKE
VERY MUCH MONEY.
HE WAS PROUD OF IT.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.911
- ALEX REMINDED ME OF HIM.
- IN WHAT WAY?

06:19.312 --> 06:20.914
YOU TRYING TO
SHRINK ME, DOCTOR?

06:21.014 --> 06:24.418
- I'M JUST CURIOUS.
- OR PERHAPS YOU
CAN'T HELP YOURSELF.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.521
( chuckles )
THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE TOO.

06:30.424 --> 06:33.927
MY FATHER AND ALEX

06:34.027 --> 06:36.864
HAD THE SAME MANNERISMS,
THE SAME SENSE OF HUMOR.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.632
IT WAS UNSETTLING.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.034
WHEN ALEX WAS A LITTLE BOY

06:41.134 --> 06:44.672
AND MY FATHER HAD BEEN
DEAD ALMOST 20 YEARS...

06:48.141 --> 06:50.911
THERE HE WAS...

06:51.011 --> 06:53.814
SITTING ACROSS THE DINNER
TABLE LOOKING AT ME--

06:53.914 --> 06:56.484
THROUGH ME
WITH THOSE EYES OF HIS

06:56.584 --> 06:58.886
ON ALEX'S FACE.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.358
IS YOUR FATHER
STILL LIVING, MR. WESTON?

07:05.459 --> 07:07.094
YES.

07:08.562 --> 07:11.765
YES, HIS BODY
IS IN GOOD HEALTH,

07:11.865 --> 07:13.767
BUT HIS--

07:15.969 --> 07:17.337
HIS MIND IS GONE.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.406
WERE YOU CLOSE?

07:19.507 --> 07:22.610
WE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES,
OF COURSE.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.513
BUT WE WERE CLOSE.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.414
WE ARE CLOSE, I MEAN.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.016
HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE HIM?

07:29.116 --> 07:30.718
ABOUT ONCE A MONTH.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.720
DOES HE KNOW
YOU'RE THERE?

07:34.121 --> 07:37.525
NO.
I DON'T THINK SO.

07:37.625 --> 07:41.294
BUT THE VISIT IS MORE
FOR MY SAKE.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.764
WHAT DO YOU GET OUT OF IT?

07:46.299 --> 07:48.569
CONNECTION,

07:48.669 --> 07:50.904
A SENSE OF...

07:52.005 --> 07:54.575
BELONGING.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.810
DO YOU EVER HAVE
CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM

07:56.910 --> 07:58.612
IN YOUR HEAD?

07:58.712 --> 08:00.413
BOTH SIDES
OF THE CONVERSATION?

08:00.514 --> 08:03.617
( laughs )
YES.

08:03.717 --> 08:08.188
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
EVERYTHING HE SAID WENT
IN ONE EAR, OUT THE OTHER.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.057
NOW I HEAR
HIS VOICE IN MY HEAD

08:10.157 --> 08:12.125
LOUD AND CLEAR EVERY DAY.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.528
SEE, THAT'S THE SENSE OF
CONNECTION THAT YOU MENTIONED.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.831
THAT'S-- THAT'S
WHAT I FEEL SLIPPING AWAY

08:17.931 --> 08:21.501
WITH EACH PASSING DAY
SINCE ALEX'S DEATH.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.503
THAT SENSE OF...

08:25.405 --> 08:27.374
I'M TRYING
TO FIND HIS VOICE,

08:27.474 --> 08:29.242
YOU KNOW, BUT...

08:32.379 --> 08:34.114
HE WON'T TALK TO ME.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.620
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING SO,
MR. PRINCE, I THINK

08:39.720 --> 08:44.091
THAT IT'S STILL
TOO SOON.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.561
YOU'RE PROBABLY STILL
IN A STATE OF SHOCK.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.732
BUT HIS VOICE...

08:51.832 --> 08:54.034
WILL COME BACK TO YOU.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.079
I APOLOGIZE
FOR COMPARING WHAT YOU DO

09:06.179 --> 09:10.383
TO, UH, PROSTITUTION.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.452
I DON'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE THE SAME AT ALL.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.655
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.598
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE

09:24.698 --> 09:27.534
MY SON ALEX?

09:27.635 --> 09:30.671
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
FOR A DIAGNOSIS.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.505
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
WHAT HE THOUGHT,

09:32.606 --> 09:35.809
JUST WHAT YOU THOUGHT
OF HIM PERSONALLY.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.118
( clears throat )

09:45.218 --> 09:47.187
I THOUGHT THAT ALEX WAS

09:47.287 --> 09:49.923
AN EXTREMELY

09:50.023 --> 09:52.626
CAPABLE MAN.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.228
STRONG SENSE OF MISSION.

09:55.328 --> 09:59.599
A VERY STRONG SENSE
OF WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.334
UH, MISSION OR PURPOSE?

10:01.434 --> 10:04.171
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- WELL, ALEX WAS
A MILITARY MAN.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.874
( clears throat )
MILITARY MEN
HAVE MISSIONS.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.876
UH...

10:08.976 --> 10:11.011
TO HAVE A PURPOSE,
A SENSE OF PURPOSE,

10:11.111 --> 10:13.914
THAT'S SOMETHING--

10:14.014 --> 10:15.415
SOMETHING YOU
DO ON YOUR OWN,

10:15.515 --> 10:17.317
SOMETHING YOU
WANT FOR YOURSELF.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.920
DID HE HAVE THAT?

10:20.020 --> 10:23.223
I THINK THAT ALEX
WAS STRUGGLING TO FIND OUT

10:23.323 --> 10:24.858
WHAT HE WANTED FOR HIMSELF.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.427
- DID HE SAY THAT?
- NO, SIR, HE DIDN'T.

10:27.527 --> 10:30.764
I'M JUST GIVING YOU
SOME OF MY IMPRESSIONS

10:30.864 --> 10:34.735
WITHOUT BETRAYING
WHAT HE CONFIDED IN ME.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.404
FRANKLY, IT'S MORE
THAN I'M ALLOWED TO DO.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.844
WERE YOU IN THE SERVICE
YOURSELF, MR. PRINCE?

10:45.045 --> 10:46.313
UM...

10:46.413 --> 10:50.317
EIGHT MONTHS, YOU KNOW,
AFTER THEY DRAFTED ME.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.720
HAD AN ASTHMA ATTACK
AND THEY DISCHARGED ME.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.654
PROBABLY SAVED MY LIFE.

10:54.755 --> 10:57.157
FUNNY, A BREATHING
PROBLEM WAS--

10:57.257 --> 10:59.092
WAS MY SALVATION,

11:00.060 --> 11:02.195
AND MY FATHER'S
DEATH KNELL.

11:05.432 --> 11:09.436
ALEX TOLD YOU ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FATHER?

11:14.808 --> 11:17.244
THESE ARE FACTS
ABOUT MY LIFE,

11:17.344 --> 11:20.247
NOT ALEX'S TREATMENT.

11:22.382 --> 11:26.286
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
HOW MY FATHER DIED?

11:26.386 --> 11:29.322
YES OR NO?
SIMPLE QUESTION.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.827
YES. YES, I DO.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.901
( sighs )

11:41.001 --> 11:44.237
ANYWAY, I WASN'T A WAR HERO

11:44.337 --> 11:47.107
LIKE MY SON, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WERE WONDERING.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.747
HOW DID YOU FEEL
ABOUT ALEX'S

11:53.847 --> 11:55.615
SERVICE IN THE NAVY?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.417
I WAS PROUD OF IT, OF COURSE,

11:57.517 --> 12:00.487
LIKE ANY FATHER WOULD BE.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.256
- WAS HE, DO YOU THINK?
- DO YOU SUSPECT
THAT HE WASN'T?

12:03.356 --> 12:07.327
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND
MY SON, MR. WESTON.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.929
AND INSTEAD OF HELPING ME,

12:09.029 --> 12:11.398
YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS
WITH QUESTIONS.

12:15.535 --> 12:18.005
I THINK YOUR SON FOUND IT

12:18.105 --> 12:21.541
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO

12:21.641 --> 12:24.744
COMPARTMENTALIZE,

12:24.845 --> 12:26.847
TO KEEP HIS FEELINGS

12:26.947 --> 12:29.817
APART FROM HIS OBLIGATIONS

12:29.917 --> 12:33.320
AND TO LIVE UP TO
THE EXPECTATIONS OF OTHERS.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.955
THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE NAVY?

12:35.055 --> 12:38.859
EXPECTATIONS TO EXCEL
LIKE HE HAD ALWAYS EXCELLED.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.728
AND AT THE EXPENSE
OF HIS OWN NEEDS

12:41.829 --> 12:46.033
AND HIS REAL DESIRES.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.002
ARE YOU SAYING THAT ALEX
WAS ILL-EQUIPPED EMOTIONALLY

12:49.102 --> 12:51.138
TO HANDLE THE PRESSURE?

12:51.238 --> 12:54.407
- MR. PRINCE,
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO SH--
- I'M ASKING YOUR OPINION.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.444
ALEX'S EMOTIONAL STATE
IS-- IS NOT SOMETHING--

12:57.544 --> 13:00.280
YOU'RE PLAYING A LITTLE
FAST AND LOOSE HERE,
AREN'T YOU, MR. WESTON?

13:00.380 --> 13:02.816
I CAN KNOW MY SON WAS TROUBLED,
JUST NOT HOW TROUBLED?

13:02.916 --> 13:05.652
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
HIS THERAPIST BELIEVED

13:05.752 --> 13:08.621
HE WAS CAPABLE OF,
HOW FAR HE WOULD GO.

13:08.721 --> 13:12.459
HOW FAR HE'D GO
TO WHAT, MR. PRINCE?

13:13.226 --> 13:14.794
( stammers )

13:19.532 --> 13:21.001
( sighs )

13:21.101 --> 13:23.470
I'VE SPOKEN TO A COUPLE
OF ALEX'S FELLOW PILOTS.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.241
IT WAS A TRAINING FLIGHT.

13:30.077 --> 13:33.246
THEY SIMULATE A BATTLE,
ONE PLANE AGAINST ANOTHER.

13:39.052 --> 13:42.155
THE OTHER PILOT
MADE A SNAP DECISION,

13:42.255 --> 13:45.825
TRIED TO GET AWAY,
APPARENTLY FLYING LOW.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.929
THEY SAY ALEX DIDN'T
HAVE TIME TO STRAIGHTEN OUT.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.899
THERE'S ALSO
A RUMOR GOING AROUND

13:51.999 --> 13:54.001
THAT ALEX KILLED HIMSELF.

13:57.737 --> 14:02.409
HE WAS A SUPERB PILOT.
IT WASN'T COMBAT, IT WAS
A TRAINING EXERCISE.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.445
IT WAS A TRAINING EXERCISE.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.918
THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY...
( clears throat )

14:11.018 --> 14:13.420
OFFICIAL...

14:13.520 --> 14:15.055
FINDING,

14:15.155 --> 14:17.057
MR. PRINCE.
YOU SAID THAT YOURSELF.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.526
THERE'S AN EJECTION SEAT.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.463
WHY DIDN'T HE JUMP?

14:26.299 --> 14:28.635
MAYBE HE

14:28.735 --> 14:31.972
DIDN'T THINK
HE NEEDED TO USE IT.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.344
WELL...

14:42.916 --> 14:46.119
MICHAELA'S BEEN IN CHURCH,

14:46.219 --> 14:49.089
YOU KNOW, ON HER KNEES

14:49.189 --> 14:51.925
PRAYING, LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.
MY WIFE ALSO.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.526
AND I TOLD 'EM,
YOU KNOW...

14:53.626 --> 14:54.962
( laughs )

14:55.062 --> 14:58.198
THAT'S THE WRONG
PLACE TO LOOK.

14:58.298 --> 15:02.735
UH, GOD AND ME,
WE'VE BEEN OVER FOR A WHILE.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.804
MY FAITH DIED

15:04.904 --> 15:06.906
WHEN MY FATHER DIED.

15:12.545 --> 15:16.916
A BOY ONCE BEAT ALEX UP.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.819
HE WAS ABOUT 10 OR 11.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.921
HE TOOK HIS SHOES.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.993
LITTLE SHIT PUNK,
YOU KNOW?

15:26.960 --> 15:28.328
ALEX DID NOTHING
TO FIGHT BACK.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.663
HE DIDN'T DEFEND HIMSELF.
HE WASN'T A FIGHTER.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.732
HE WAS A--

15:32.832 --> 15:34.934
HE WAS A FRAIL KID.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.504
YOU KNOW?
THIN-SKINNED.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.573
AND THAT SCARED
THE HELL OUT OF ME.

15:40.673 --> 15:44.144
WHERE I COME FROM,
THIN BLACK SKIN
COULD GET YOU KILLED.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.846
AND THAT WAS
THE KIND OF WORLD THAT--

15:46.946 --> 15:48.181
THAT ALEX WAS BORN INTO?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.050
WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.718
I'M SIMPLY ASKING IF HE--

15:51.818 --> 15:53.886
NO NO NO.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.789
I SAW MORE INJUSTICES

15:56.889 --> 15:58.758
AS A CHILD.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.693
HORRORS.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.530
DID THEY--

16:04.998 --> 16:08.035
DID THEY AFFECT
MY VIEW OF THE WORLD?

16:08.868 --> 16:11.638
OF COURSE.

16:11.738 --> 16:15.508
DID THEY SHAPE THE MANNER
IN WHICH I RAISED MY BOY?

16:15.608 --> 16:17.410
HOW COULD THEY NOT?

16:17.510 --> 16:19.612
STRENGTH.

16:21.214 --> 16:26.053
STRENGTH WAS ESSENTIAL
TO SURVIVAL.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.089
VULNERABILITY

16:29.189 --> 16:31.724
WAS OFTEN A DEATH SENTENCE.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.693
I WANTED HIM TO BE SAFE.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.814
I ENVY THE TIME YOU SPENT
TALKING WITH HIM.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.483
I ADMIT...

16:56.583 --> 16:59.386
THOSE KIND OF TALKS
EMBARRASS THE HELL OUT OF ME.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.356
THIS WHERE HE SAT?

17:03.456 --> 17:05.058
YES.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.416
ALEX COULD TALK.

17:29.516 --> 17:30.850
OH, YEAH.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.653
HE AND HIS BOY,
THEY'D TALK FOR HOURS.

17:36.323 --> 17:39.359
HE EVEN ONCE TOLD ROY
THAT HE LOVED HIM.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.794
BOY, I TELL YOU...
( laughs )

17:41.894 --> 17:44.864
DID I GIVE HIM
HELL FOR THAT.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.900
"WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?
MAKE THE KID SOME KIND
OF SISSY OR SOMETHING?"

17:48.000 --> 17:52.004
IT WAS BAD ENOUGH
THAT HE DIDN'T WANT
TO BEST ALEX AT ANYTHING.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.241
HE'D RATHER THROW
A CHESS GAME

17:54.341 --> 17:57.244
JUST SO'S HE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO BEAT HIS FATHER.

17:57.344 --> 18:00.580
OH NOW, COME ON.
THAT'S NO WAY TO RAISE
A BOY TO BE A MAN.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.183
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO CHALLENGE
HIM, MAKE HIM COMPETE,

18:03.283 --> 18:05.118
TEACH HIM HOW TO FIGHT,
TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.

18:05.218 --> 18:08.355
IT'S INTERESTING
THAT YOU REGRET NOT BEING

18:08.455 --> 18:10.690
MORE GENTLE YOURSELF
WITH ALEX,

18:10.790 --> 18:12.292
AND YET
AT THE SAME TIME,

18:12.392 --> 18:14.927
YOU SEEM TO JUSTIFY
BEING-- BEING HARSH.

18:15.027 --> 18:18.598
I HEAR YOU SAYING THAT
YOU'RE A LITTLE CONFLICTED
ABOUT THE NOTION--

18:18.698 --> 18:21.868
MISTER, I'M NOT
IN CONFLICT ABOUT ANYTHING.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.477
IS THAT HOW YOU
TRIED TO HELP ALEX?

18:30.577 --> 18:33.546
SECOND-GUESSING EVERY WORD
THAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH?

18:33.646 --> 18:35.482
A STRANGER,

18:35.582 --> 18:39.619
COMPLETELY UNFAMILIAR
WITH HIS BACKGROUND.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.021
YOU GO EXPLAINING
HIS WORLD TO HIM.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.557
ACTUALLY,
OUR SESSIONS WERE MOSTLY

18:44.657 --> 18:48.395
ABOUT ME
LISTENING TO WHAT--
TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

18:48.495 --> 18:51.164
YEAH, WELL, THERE WE GO
AGAIN WITH THE LISTENING, HUH?

18:51.264 --> 18:53.933
HE HAS HIS OWN PERSONAL
PROFESSIONAL LISTENER.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.603
LISTEN, WHEN I SMOTHERED
MY FATHER

18:56.703 --> 19:00.273
DO YOU THINK I PAID SOMEONE
TO LISTEN TO ME, HMM?

19:00.373 --> 19:03.343
YOU CAN'T STOP AND DWELL
ON EVERY ACHE AND PAIN.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.178
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
OF WHAT MY DAD DID

19:05.278 --> 19:07.113
OR MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
OF WHAT MY MOTHER DID.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.382
COME ON, YOU'VE GOT
TO KEEP MOVING, MAN.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.519
YOU KNOW? WHAT GOOD
DOES ALL THE TALK DO?

19:12.619 --> 19:15.455
IT'S NOT GONNA BRING
MY FATHER BACK.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:15.555 --> 19:17.990
PEOPLE LIKE YOU--
YOU NEVER STOP TO THINK

19:18.090 --> 19:20.059
THAT WE HAVE
A SUBCONSCIOUS

19:20.159 --> 19:21.728
FOR A REASON.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.331
BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS
ABOUT OURSELVES

19:24.431 --> 19:27.634
THAT WE CANNOT FACE.
THAT WE SHOULD NOT FACE.

19:27.734 --> 19:32.505
OR ELSE HOW IN THE WORLD
DO WE GET UP OUT OF BED
IN THE MORNING?

19:32.605 --> 19:35.141
I'LL TELL YOU,
WORLD WAR III COMES...

19:35.242 --> 19:38.144
( sighs )
ALL THOSE PEOPLE
WHO'VE BEEN THROUGH

19:38.245 --> 19:41.013
ALL OF THIS PSYCHOANALYSIS,

19:41.113 --> 19:43.350
SPEND HUNDREDS--
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS,

19:43.450 --> 19:45.452
ARE GONNA BE THE FIRST ONES
TO LOSE THEIR HEADS.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.120
MM-HMM.
DARWIN HAD A THEORY.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.690
HE CALLED IT
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.926
THE FITTEST,
NOT THE MOST SELF-REFLECTIVE.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.262
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

19:55.362 --> 19:58.465
I THINK THAT ALEX
STARTED COMING HERE

19:58.565 --> 20:00.833
BECAUSE HE FELT
THAT HE NEEDED TO.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.670
AND YOU HAD TO TAKE
HIM APART, DIDN'T YOU?

20:03.770 --> 20:05.238
HMM?

20:05.338 --> 20:08.140
YOU HAD TO PICK
AT THE SCAB. HMM?

20:08.241 --> 20:11.177
DO YOU THINK
THAT ALEX'S THERAPY HERE

20:11.278 --> 20:14.847
HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH HIS DEATH?

20:14.947 --> 20:17.950
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD HIM

20:18.050 --> 20:20.920
HE HAD TO GO LOOK INSIDE.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.056
TO REFLECT,

20:24.156 --> 20:26.893
EXAMINE, FEEL.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.928
OH YEAH,
HE FELT.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.030
YEAH. AND WHAT
DID THAT GET HIM?

20:31.130 --> 20:34.066
NOW HE'S A HUMAN PANCAKE.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.603
YOU'RE A HELL
OF A MIRACLE WORKER, DOCTOR.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.979
( sighs )

21:03.029 --> 21:05.164
YOU HAVE A SON, MR. WESTON?

21:05.264 --> 21:07.066
YES, I DO.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.168
AND IF ANOTHER MAN,

21:09.268 --> 21:11.971
SOMEONE FROM
A DIFFERENT CULTURE,

21:12.071 --> 21:15.642
STARTED GIVING HIM ADVICE

21:15.742 --> 21:17.577
EVERY WEEK...

21:18.711 --> 21:22.449
ADVICE THAT YOU
WERE PRETTY SURE

21:22.549 --> 21:25.552
WOULD BE HARMFUL
TO YOUR SON...

21:27.086 --> 21:28.220
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.357
YOUR SON
WAS A MATURE MAN

21:30.457 --> 21:33.192
WHO DECIDED TO COME HERE
OF HIS OWN--

21:33.292 --> 21:35.795
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

21:40.166 --> 21:41.834
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

21:48.107 --> 21:49.776
I WOULD TRY TO STOP HIM

21:51.411 --> 21:53.012
IF I COULD.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.863
I CAN'T GET
OVER THE FEELING...

22:14.867 --> 22:17.570
THAT I WAS TORN APART
IN THIS ROOM.

22:19.639 --> 22:23.209
PEOPLE HAVE
A MISUNDERSTANDING

22:23.309 --> 22:26.846
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN--
IN ROOMS LIKE THIS.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.851
IT REALLY ISN'T ABOUT

22:31.951 --> 22:35.488
BLAMING OR LOOKING
FOR SCAPEGOATS.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.502
HE WAS AN OUTSTANDING PERSON.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.740
HE WAS KIND,

22:53.840 --> 22:56.108
DEVOTED,

22:56.208 --> 22:58.077
LOYAL...

23:00.780 --> 23:02.482
TOO LOYAL.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.152
OFTEN, I WISHED THAT HE

23:06.252 --> 23:08.888
WOULD'VE JUST
PLEASED HIMSELF, NOT ME.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.958
BUT WE WANT TO PLEASE,

23:12.058 --> 23:14.060
DON'T WE, MR. WESTON?

23:15.995 --> 23:18.431
HE DID A LIFETIME
OF TRYING TO PLEASE ME.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.767
ALL THAT--

23:23.903 --> 23:25.605
THAT TOUGH--

23:28.307 --> 23:30.042
THAT TOUGH SCHOOLING...

23:32.745 --> 23:35.047
AND THE TRAINING AND...

23:36.983 --> 23:38.751
THE ACHIEVEMENTS--

23:42.288 --> 23:44.023
THAT WAS FOR ME.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.892
I'M THE ONE
WHO NEEDED IT.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.098
TO FEEL...

23:52.198 --> 23:54.501
THAT HE WAS SAFE.

23:56.335 --> 23:57.970
YOU KNOW?

24:02.074 --> 24:04.477
YOU SON LOVED YOU.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.548
AND HE HAD HUGE
ADMIRATION FOR YOU.

24:10.382 --> 24:12.451
HE TOLD ME THAT.

24:16.422 --> 24:18.491
DON'T TELL ME THAT, MAN.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.895
YOU THINK THAT COMFORT--

24:22.995 --> 24:25.698
( sniffles )
YOU THINK THAT COMFORTS ME?

24:29.268 --> 24:32.304
NO.
I WOULD HAVE RATHERED

24:32.404 --> 24:35.642
THAT HE HATED ME.

24:40.446 --> 24:42.849
I WOULD HAVE RATHERED

24:42.949 --> 24:47.954
THAT THIS WAS HIS
"FUCK YOU" TO ME.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.161
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

24:56.796 --> 24:59.566
FOR PUSHING HIM SO HARD...

25:02.201 --> 25:06.105
TO BE TOUGHER...

25:08.474 --> 25:10.577
THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.679
I WAS SO STUPID.

25:27.426 --> 25:29.629
DID I KILL MY SON?

25:35.501 --> 25:38.237
I KILLED MY FATHER
WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.109
DID I KILL MY SON TOO?

25:43.209 --> 25:47.013
NO, WHATEVER
HAPPENED UP THERE
WAS NOT YOUR FAULT.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.682
YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.562
WE'LL NEVER KNOW, WILL WE?

26:11.771 --> 26:14.040
WELL, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

26:18.310 --> 26:21.313
I'D APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH
IF YOU'D CALL ME A TAXI, PLEASE.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.316
SURE.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.850
( theme music playing )
