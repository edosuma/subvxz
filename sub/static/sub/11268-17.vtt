00:05.872 --> 00:08.607
        Hey, Dr. Crane.         
        Look what I got.        

00:08.675 --> 00:10.576
 That's quite a trophy, Woody.  

00:10.643 --> 00:12.044
                I didn't know   
                you played golf.

00:12.212 --> 00:13.479
I don't.                        

00:13.546 --> 00:16.415
There's a...                    
trophy shop down the street.    

00:18.385 --> 00:21.286
You just... bought this trophy? 
      You don't even golf?      

00:21.354 --> 00:22.521
Why should I?                   

00:22.589 --> 00:24.490
          Well, because the idea
          of a trophy is to show

00:24.557 --> 00:25.557
                    some sort of
                 accomplishment.

00:25.625 --> 00:27.026
                      You should
                  learn to golf.

00:27.093 --> 00:28.694
     Go out, take a couple      
          of lessons.           

00:28.762 --> 00:31.263
Spend some hours mastering      
 the finer points of the game.  

00:31.331 --> 00:32.464
    And then?                   

00:32.531 --> 00:34.066
Well, then you get better       

00:34.134 --> 00:36.301
and you can join a country club.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.436
        And then?               

00:37.504 --> 00:39.004
                  Well, and then
                you can compete.

00:39.072 --> 00:40.205
                     Maybe enter
            some tournaments.   

00:40.273 --> 00:41.674
        And then?               

00:41.741 --> 00:43.208
 And maybe some day, you'll be  
    the best and you'll win,    

00:43.276 --> 00:44.510
    and then you'll get a...    

00:44.577 --> 00:46.078
A trophy, Dr. Crane?            

00:48.348 --> 00:50.783
                Congratulations,
                          Woody.

02:04.224 --> 02:07.426
There's something different     
about Dr. Sternin-Crane.        

02:07.494 --> 02:08.994
I can't put                     
my finger on it.                

02:09.062 --> 02:10.696
Is it her hair?                 

02:10.764 --> 02:11.930
No, no. I'll-I'll get it.       

02:11.998 --> 02:13.332
        Her dress?              

02:14.834 --> 02:18.504
        Oh, I've got it,        
 her husband's growing a beard. 

02:20.373 --> 02:23.242
              Did I hear someone
            mention my beard?   

02:25.211 --> 02:27.813
                That's right,   
                Woody-- a beard,

02:27.881 --> 02:30.649
      the ultimate manifestation
                 of masculinity.

02:30.717 --> 02:34.987
      Testosterone surging      
        through my face!        

02:36.690 --> 02:39.525
    Every red-blooded man's     
 birthright-- hair on his chin. 

02:39.592 --> 02:41.326
  I don't know why I didn't do  
          this before.          

02:41.394 --> 02:43.228
  Because I wouldn't let you.   

02:43.296 --> 02:44.663
     Oh, yes. That's right.     

02:44.731 --> 02:46.799
  It all comes back to me now.  

02:50.170 --> 02:52.338
    Hi. I-I'm looking           
        for Woody Boyd.         

02:52.405 --> 02:54.840
                    Oh! Russell!
Hey!                            

02:54.908 --> 02:56.608
      Russell! Russell! Russell!

02:56.676 --> 02:58.344
                     All the way
                from Florida!   
Hey!                            

02:58.411 --> 03:00.112
          How're you doing, cuz?
I'm great, man! Great.          

03:00.180 --> 03:02.114
                    Hey, Sam,   
              guess who this is.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.550
Uh-h, your cousin Russell       
         from Florida?          

03:04.617 --> 03:07.586
                Wow! What are   
                you, a witch?   

03:07.654 --> 03:08.754
          Hi, Russell.          

03:08.822 --> 03:09.922
        I'm Sam...              
Sam Malone.                     

03:09.989 --> 03:12.791
I know. Woody's told me         
all about this place.           

03:12.859 --> 03:17.329
Oh, Miss Howe, just as beautiful
as Woody said you were.         

03:17.397 --> 03:19.064
    Well, thank you, Woody.     

03:19.132 --> 03:21.033
 Hey, uh, there's Mr. Peterson, 

03:21.101 --> 03:22.468
and look, Mr. Clavin.           

03:22.535 --> 03:24.870
Hey, there's the Cranes.        

03:24.938 --> 03:27.239
     You were right, Woody,     
    like she's seen a ghost.    

03:29.609 --> 03:32.177
     And there, and there's     
         Carla, right?          

03:32.245 --> 03:34.213
          And Tecumseh          
and the, and the jukebox,       

03:34.280 --> 03:36.915
      and the wooden lady,      
and the little porthole...      

03:36.983 --> 03:38.517
Hey, Russell, I-I guess         
you know who I am.              

03:38.585 --> 03:40.052
I'm Paul Krapence.              

03:40.120 --> 03:43.689
              Who?              

03:43.757 --> 03:44.923
        I-I was going on and on.

03:44.991 --> 03:46.859
          I had to draw the line
                 somewhere.     

03:46.926 --> 03:48.994
        Hey, uh, Russell, let me
     get you something to drink.

03:50.263 --> 03:53.332
              Well, well, one of
              Woody's relatives.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.700
                 Hello, Russell.
        Hi.                     

03:54.768 --> 03:57.302
          Say, Russell, uh, have
    you ever been to Hanover?   

03:57.370 --> 03:59.405
I spent every summer            
of my life there.               

03:59.472 --> 04:01.040
      Yes, well, Woody's told us
                 a lot about it,

04:01.107 --> 04:02.374
            and I'm sure we'd   
            all be interested   

04:02.442 --> 04:03.942
                  in a different
                    perspective.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.145
 Well, you know, it's just like 
        any other small,        

04:06.212 --> 04:07.312
rural town in the Midwest.      

04:07.380 --> 04:09.648
    There's acres and acres     
          of farmland,          

04:09.716 --> 04:11.483
    and hard-working people.    

04:11.551 --> 04:13.752
 You know, it's also the U.F.O. 
     capital of the world.      

04:15.989 --> 04:18.423
                 Enjoy your stay
             in Boston, Russell.

04:18.491 --> 04:19.658
                      Thank you.

04:21.226 --> 04:22.828
Hey, Russell,                   
you can stay with me.           

04:22.896 --> 04:24.563
I got a real                    
nice apartment.                 

04:24.631 --> 04:26.732
The couch almost opens out      
          into a bed.           

04:26.800 --> 04:29.335
Most days you've got heat       
and hot water.                  

04:29.402 --> 04:30.969
    And it's usually quiet,     

04:31.037 --> 04:33.639
  except the couple next door   
  is off the wagon this week.   

04:33.707 --> 04:35.441
              Wow, Woody, that's
             a great offer, man,

04:35.508 --> 04:37.042
              but I already made
                a reservation   

04:37.110 --> 04:38.644
                in this cheap   
                little motel.   

04:38.712 --> 04:40.479
      Can I stay with you?      

04:42.082 --> 04:44.650
Well, Russell, why don't you    
put your suitcase in the office.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.585
     That's real kind, sir,     
  but like I just told Woody,   

04:46.653 --> 04:48.187
 I already got a room reserved. 

04:48.254 --> 04:51.090
Oh, well, then                  
just while you're here.         

04:53.460 --> 04:55.794
                  Hey, Sam... be
            real nice to him.   

04:55.862 --> 04:57.629
    He's... he's heartbroken.   

04:57.697 --> 04:59.098
        His girl he's been going
        out with for a long time

04:59.165 --> 05:01.033
                just dumped him.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.235
          So he's come to Boston
            to make a new start.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.805
      I think he's hoping to hit
          the big time, like me.

05:06.873 --> 05:08.140
        Big time?               

05:08.208 --> 05:09.675
Woody, you're a bartender.      

05:09.743 --> 05:11.777
    You-you're living           
         hand-to-mouth.         

05:11.845 --> 05:13.379
        Yep. Back in Hanover,   

05:13.446 --> 05:16.181
             people think I made
          a pact with the Devil.

05:18.885 --> 05:21.653
What's Russell going to do while
he's here in Boston, Woody?     

05:21.721 --> 05:23.188
                Well, I don't   
                know, Miss Howe.
(playing simple melody on piano)

05:23.256 --> 05:25.224
          I was hoping          
    he could work at Cheers.    

05:25.291 --> 05:26.892
  What does he know how to do?  

05:26.960 --> 05:28.327
    Uh, that's the question.    

05:28.395 --> 05:30.963
Yeah, he was always off writing 
  and sculpting and painting,   

05:31.031 --> 05:33.265
      while the rest of us      
    were bettering ourselves    

05:33.333 --> 05:37.369
  by learning air-conditioning  
 repair and riding dirt bikes.  

05:38.872 --> 05:40.005
                Yeah, to tell   
                  you the truth,

05:40.073 --> 05:42.074
          I don't know if he can
            do much of anything.

05:42.142 --> 05:46.512
  (plays boogie-woogie melody   
         virtuosically)         

05:55.622 --> 05:57.856
        Of course!              
Why didn't I think of it before?

05:57.924 --> 06:00.025
      He can be a busboy.       

06:00.093 --> 06:01.493
          Hey, Russ...          

06:01.561 --> 06:05.064
      Sam, why don't we hire him
    to be the piano player here?

06:05.131 --> 06:06.331
Well... maybe,                  

06:06.399 --> 06:08.200
as long                         
as he works for tips.           

06:08.268 --> 06:09.268
                Well, you-you   
                won't regret it.

06:09.336 --> 06:10.703
                    I know about
                these things.   

06:10.770 --> 06:12.338
            I have a golden gut.

06:12.405 --> 06:14.440
  It must be worth a fortune.   

06:14.507 --> 06:15.674
                  Oh, I'm sorry.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.576
    I thought you said          
         "golden butt."         

06:23.717 --> 06:26.251
Well, here's your mail, Rebecca.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.419
                      Thank you.

06:27.487 --> 06:29.722
                          CLIFF:
             Hey, uh, Twitchell.

06:29.789 --> 06:31.423
Hey, Clavin.                    

06:31.491 --> 06:34.059
  How come every other mailman  
in this town is out there       

06:34.127 --> 06:36.028
        busting his hump        
    and you're in here          

06:36.096 --> 06:38.797
sitting on your over-sized      
        irregular?              

06:38.865 --> 06:42.134
Return it to sender,            
Twitchell.                      

06:42.202 --> 06:44.436
You left this in your box,      
            Clavin.             

06:44.504 --> 06:45.771
     What's that?               

06:45.839 --> 06:48.407
That's the official memo        
regarding the new uniforms.     

06:48.475 --> 06:50.909
    Starting tomorrow,          
they are regulation wear,       

06:50.977 --> 06:52.811
      and that's by order       

06:52.879 --> 06:54.413
            of the Postmaster   
                        General.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.682
    Huh.                        

06:56.750 --> 06:57.950
Wait a second.                  

06:58.018 --> 07:00.085
I can't believe you opened      
my mail there, Twitch.          

07:00.153 --> 07:01.453
                          Hey...

07:01.521 --> 07:04.356
Ah!                             
                      (chuckles)

07:04.424 --> 07:05.524
                That's a good   
                    one, Clavin.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.826
      Yeah.                     

07:07.894 --> 07:09.928
              But, uh, you can't
                 escape the fact

07:09.996 --> 07:11.163
         that starting tomorrow,

07:11.231 --> 07:13.298
             we all have to wear
            the new uniforms.   

07:13.366 --> 07:14.433
                  No exceptions.

07:14.501 --> 07:15.734
         Oh, yeah?              

07:15.802 --> 07:18.737
Well, this is what I think      
      of the new uniforms.      

07:18.805 --> 07:20.706
            Oh, come on, now.   
        It's not as bad as that.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.441
                You haven't even
                  seen them yet.

07:22.509 --> 07:23.976
That's right,                   
and I don't want to.            

07:24.044 --> 07:25.744
As far as I'm concerned,        
it doesn't exist.               

07:25.812 --> 07:28.847
This is the uniform that made me
want to become a postal worker. 

07:28.915 --> 07:31.083
And this is the uniform         
I'm sticking to.                

07:31.151 --> 07:32.351
 You wouldn't have that problem 

07:32.419 --> 07:34.253
        if you washed it        
        once in a while.        

07:34.320 --> 07:37.156
         Uh...                  

07:37.223 --> 07:40.359
            You know, this is   
        insubordination, Clavin.

07:40.427 --> 07:43.829
I got no choice but to report   
          you to the supervisor.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.664
    I don't care if you do.     

07:45.732 --> 07:47.700
    There comes a time          
      in every man's life       

07:47.767 --> 07:49.101
     when he's got to show      
          his manhood,          

07:49.169 --> 07:50.769
                put his cards   
                on the table.   

07:50.837 --> 07:53.405
                 Can we just see
                      the cards?

07:54.574 --> 07:55.874
You know, you guys,             
if we're going to have          

07:55.942 --> 07:57.343
a piano player                  
that's this great,              

07:57.410 --> 07:59.178
we shouldn't hide him up        
there in the corner.            

07:59.245 --> 08:00.646
I think we should move the piano
        down here               

08:00.714 --> 08:01.814
 and put it against this wall.  

08:01.881 --> 08:03.382
                     If you help
                     me move it,

08:03.450 --> 08:06.051
        I'll give               
    each of you a free beer.    

08:06.119 --> 08:07.186
Oh, great.                      

08:07.253 --> 08:08.754
I mean, I suppose               
you think we're...              

08:08.822 --> 08:10.422
we're like a couple             
of trained dogs.                

08:10.490 --> 08:11.824
Every time you want us          
to do something,                

08:11.891 --> 08:13.692
you'll waggle a free beer       
under our face.                 

08:13.760 --> 08:15.728
Uh-uh. We have                  
some self-respect.              

08:15.795 --> 08:16.895
We have a little dignity.       

08:16.963 --> 08:18.864
Am I right, Paul?               
                      Mm-hmm.   

08:18.932 --> 08:21.333
        If I do it by myself,   
          can I have both beers?

08:21.401 --> 08:22.668
                        Sure.   

08:23.770 --> 08:25.170
Way to go, fathead.             

08:25.238 --> 08:27.873
I was working her               
for a pitcher.                  

08:32.712 --> 08:33.846
        (both grunting)         

08:33.913 --> 08:35.414
There.                          
That wasn't so hard.            

08:35.482 --> 08:38.049
         Yeah. Get a couple guys
    who know what they're doing,

08:38.118 --> 08:39.518
                no problem, huh?

08:39.586 --> 08:41.120
Just hope Rebecca doesn't       
need us to move it back.        

08:41.187 --> 08:43.722
That could get                  
a little hairy.                 

08:51.264 --> 08:55.734
     (playing boogie-woogie     
            melody)             

08:56.936 --> 08:58.737
That's great, Russell.          

09:00.940 --> 09:02.074
        All right.              
                        Whoo.   

09:05.679 --> 09:06.679
                    Thanks...   

09:06.746 --> 09:08.047
    Thanks a lot, Miss Howe.    

09:08.114 --> 09:10.382
    Say, what would you call    
      that color of hair?       

09:10.450 --> 09:11.850
What? This hair?                
                        Mm-hmm. 

09:11.918 --> 09:13.452
                      Well, it's
                nothing unusual.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.821
                      It's just,
                uh, what a...   

09:15.889 --> 09:19.191
                 medium chestnut
         with auburn highlights.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.895
Is that what it said            
on the bottle?                  

09:24.698 --> 09:26.598
Why do you ask, Russell?        

09:26.666 --> 09:27.866
  Well I was hoping to use it   
        in a song.              

09:27.934 --> 09:31.303
  Do you mind if I just say...  

09:31.371 --> 09:34.306
     The color of romance,      
    (playing gentle melody)     

09:34.374 --> 09:36.375
     the color of longing,      

09:36.443 --> 09:39.278
    the color of the feeling    
            I get...            

09:39.346 --> 09:42.581
     when I see you smile?      

09:42.649 --> 09:43.849
             Okay.              

09:45.652 --> 09:50.422
I think we have a May-December  
thing happening here.           

09:50.490 --> 09:52.825
Yeah. December                  
of the following year.          

09:52.892 --> 09:56.995
I'd say he's got a major case   
of puppy love going here.       

09:57.063 --> 10:00.332
He's following you around,      
asking to do errands for you,   

10:00.400 --> 10:02.067
wanting rides                   
back to the motel.              

10:02.135 --> 10:03.602
        Oh, so what if he has   
        a little crush on me.   

10:03.670 --> 10:05.170
             I think it's sweet.

10:05.238 --> 10:08.841
Rebecca, you know I've seen     
this type of behavior before.   

10:08.908 --> 10:11.143
When Frasier first had          
a crush on me,                  

10:11.211 --> 10:13.212
he had difficulty               
expressing his feelings.        

10:13.279 --> 10:14.747
He was very shy.                

10:14.814 --> 10:17.149
So he expressed them            
in other ways.                  

10:17.217 --> 10:18.784
Uh, calling me at all hours,    

10:18.852 --> 10:20.652
 and then when I answered,      
        hanging up.             

10:20.720 --> 10:22.955
Just sitting quietly            
in his car,                     

10:23.023 --> 10:25.224
in front of my house,           
hour after hour.                

10:25.291 --> 10:26.892
Going through my mail,          

10:26.960 --> 10:30.229
and then carefully replacing    
the letters in my mailbox.      

10:30.296 --> 10:33.432
In other words, stalking me.    

10:34.901 --> 10:39.271
        It got what I wanted,   
                    didn't I?   

10:39.339 --> 10:42.775
  You know, you guys, there's   
  no need to worry about this.  

10:42.842 --> 10:46.178
 I mean, if it gets out of hand,
         I know just what to do.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.579
     Ladies and gentlemen,      

10:47.647 --> 10:50.749
I would like to dedicate a song 
  to a very, very lovely lady,  

10:50.817 --> 10:52.418
    Miss Rebecca Howe.          

10:52.485 --> 10:55.487
        (piano playing)         

10:55.555 --> 11:01.293
     ¶ I spent last night ¶     

11:01.361 --> 11:05.831
¶ Dreaming of your eyes ¶       

11:05.899 --> 11:11.704
      ¶ But your hair kept      
      getting in the way ¶      

11:14.140 --> 11:18.043
    ¶ Your lips dropped in ¶    

11:18.111 --> 11:22.047
 ¶ To tell me how you'd been ¶  

11:22.115 --> 11:26.085
    ¶ And when I tried          
         to kiss them ¶         

11:26.152 --> 11:30.723
      ¶ My pillow told me       
        I missed them ¶         

11:30.790 --> 11:34.727
¶ Your voice dropped by ¶       

11:34.794 --> 11:38.731
     ¶ And sang a lullaby ¶     

11:38.798 --> 11:45.704
    ¶ And it was then           
    I knew just what to do ¶    

11:47.140 --> 11:54.380
  ¶ I'd fall asleep and then ¶  

11:56.883 --> 12:01.153
      ¶ I'd dream of you ¶      

12:03.656 --> 12:05.824
        ¶ Again. ¶              

12:10.797 --> 12:12.364
Oh, sure,                       

12:12.432 --> 12:14.366
but ask him to fix              
an air conditioner.             

12:16.236 --> 12:17.836
            My muse.            

12:17.904 --> 12:19.805
        My inspiration.         

12:26.479 --> 12:29.014
    Oh, Sam, he's so sweet.     

12:29.082 --> 12:30.849
      I don't want to hurt      
         his feelings.          

12:30.917 --> 12:31.917
        What do you say         

12:31.985 --> 12:33.218
            when you break up   
                with a woman?   

12:33.286 --> 12:36.021
I usually say,                  
"I'll call you tomorrow."       

12:43.563 --> 12:46.532
                Well, Russell   
                  and Miss Howe.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.067
    Yeah.                       
                      Yeah.     

12:48.168 --> 12:49.768
            Never thought of it,
              but it could work.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.036
                    I mean, they
                could go out.   

12:51.104 --> 12:52.671
          They could hit it off.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.640
         Maybe even get married.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.175
                 Hey, who knows?

12:56.242 --> 12:58.043
         Maybe he could give her
          the baby you couldn't.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.948
That was a choice, Woody.       

13:11.624 --> 13:13.459
Hey, thanks a lot for the ride, 
            Rebecca.            

13:13.526 --> 13:15.627
You feel like coming in         
for a cup of coffee?            

13:15.695 --> 13:17.296
                 Uh, no, thanks,
                        Russell.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.797
                        Um...   

13:18.865 --> 13:19.932
                Russell, I-I had
                    something   

13:20.000 --> 13:21.367
                that I wanted   
                to say to you   

13:21.434 --> 13:25.004
and I, and I-I didn't get       
  a chance to in the car, um,   

13:25.071 --> 13:27.172
            I don't know exactly
                  how to put it.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.841
                     I wanted to
                     talk to you

13:28.908 --> 13:30.776
                 about the crush
                 you have on me.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.911
I don't have a crush            
on you, Rebecca.                

13:32.979 --> 13:34.513
        You what?               

13:34.581 --> 13:36.615
I don't have a crush on you.    

13:36.683 --> 13:37.850
                      (quietly):
                      You don't?
    No.                         

13:37.917 --> 13:39.385
                     Oh, my God.
(laughs)                        

13:39.452 --> 13:41.387
             I'm so embarrassed.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.721
                    Oh, dear.   

13:42.789 --> 13:43.822
                    Oh, well.   

13:43.890 --> 13:45.257
             All right, Russell,
                  I will come in

13:45.325 --> 13:46.892
            and have that cup   
                      of coffee.
Yeah, come on in.               

13:46.960 --> 13:48.427
                    Oh.         

13:48.495 --> 13:49.561
        After you.              

13:51.598 --> 13:53.966
            (gasps)             

13:54.034 --> 13:56.101
                        Rebecca,

13:56.169 --> 13:58.037
                  I don't have a
                crush on you.   

13:58.104 --> 14:00.839
        I just love you with all
        of my heart and soul.   

14:13.253 --> 14:15.187
        (piano playing)         

14:15.255 --> 14:18.390
                      Thank you.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.458
                     Thanks.    

14:19.526 --> 14:20.893
                Thank you.      

14:20.960 --> 14:22.895
        Say, folks, I'm gonna be
        taking a short break.   

14:22.962 --> 14:24.897
            Woody, have you seen
                     my snifter?

14:24.964 --> 14:26.765
      Oh, it's over there.      

14:26.833 --> 14:29.735
     Sammy, you want to put     
    a head on this, please?     

14:36.476 --> 14:37.743
                That's yours.   

14:37.811 --> 14:39.645
    Thanks.                     

14:39.713 --> 14:42.648
         Say, uh, say,          
         Sammy, is, uh,         

14:42.716 --> 14:44.650
  is Rebecca coming in today?   

14:44.718 --> 14:46.285
Well, she's scheduled           
to work                         

14:46.353 --> 14:48.821
    so I'm not really sure.     

14:48.888 --> 14:50.689
      Well, maybe I should      
    swing by her place          

14:50.757 --> 14:52.124
  and see if she's all right.   

14:52.192 --> 14:54.793
     Say, does anybody know     
        where she lives?        

14:54.861 --> 14:56.795
Never mind, I'll find it.       

15:01.768 --> 15:04.837
Thank God he's gone!            

15:04.904 --> 15:06.305
    Hey, where the hell have    
    you been all afternoon?     

15:06.373 --> 15:09.808
    Hiding up at Melville's     
 waiting for Russell to leave.  

15:09.876 --> 15:11.810
        You know, I sat up there

15:11.878 --> 15:13.645
         for three hours pushing
                 my glass around

15:13.713 --> 15:15.447
                  making moronic
                     small talk.

15:15.515 --> 15:18.817
Boy, if I ever get like that,   
        put a gun to my head.   

15:18.885 --> 15:21.120
              I thought he had a
             little crush on me.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.022
Mm-hmm.                         
            It's a full-blown   
                      obsession.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.189
            The man worships me.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.657
                  It's like he's
                    a little bit

15:25.725 --> 15:27.960
          off balance,          
    if you know what I mean.    

15:28.028 --> 15:29.261
                 He worships you

15:29.329 --> 15:31.263
            and you think he's a
             little off balance?

15:33.500 --> 15:35.668
Woody, was Russell              
different                       

15:35.735 --> 15:37.970
              in any way when he
                 was growing up?

15:38.038 --> 15:40.639
Well, he does have              
one little quirk.               

15:40.707 --> 15:42.808
You know, when he likes         
something,                      

15:42.876 --> 15:44.476
he really gets                  
carried away.                   

15:44.544 --> 15:47.312
I mean, uh, you know,           
one time he liked trains.       

15:47.380 --> 15:48.981
I mean, really                  
liked them.                     

15:49.049 --> 15:50.649
                 Collected them,

15:50.717 --> 15:52.317
wrote songs about them,         

15:52.385 --> 15:55.154
pasted pictures                 
all over his walls.             

15:55.221 --> 15:56.889
You know, in fact               
he-he even thought              

15:56.956 --> 15:58.323
he was a train                  
for a while.                    

15:58.391 --> 15:59.658
                Every morning   

15:59.726 --> 16:02.528
at 7:53, you could hear him     
coming through town.            

16:04.564 --> 16:06.632
                What do I do?   
The advisable                   

16:06.700 --> 16:09.068
course of action is             
to not take any chances.        

16:09.135 --> 16:10.469
A woman living alone            

16:10.537 --> 16:12.204
who feels threatened            
in any fashion,                 

16:12.272 --> 16:14.006
is entitled                     
to police protection.           

16:14.074 --> 16:16.342
     I thought I'd just be      
    a little bit more direct    

16:16.409 --> 16:18.043
          and tell him          
      I wasn't interested.      

16:18.111 --> 16:19.111
                    Yeah, right.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.312
Be direct.                      

16:21.681 --> 16:23.682
                     Lay people.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.522
                    Uh, can I   
                    help you?   

16:30.590 --> 16:32.157
      Do you have a Clavin      
             here?              

16:32.225 --> 16:34.727
    Yeah, but it hasn't been    
     flushing right lately.     

16:34.794 --> 16:37.196
Wait, wait,                     
there he is.                    

16:37.263 --> 16:38.997
There's                         
the renegade.                   

16:39.065 --> 16:40.833
                        Oh, hey,
                      Twitchell.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.068
             What'd you do, tell
                 your dad on me?

16:43.136 --> 16:45.037
        Henderson.              

16:45.105 --> 16:47.706
    Postal inspector,           
         South Branch.          

16:47.774 --> 16:49.174
    There have been reports     
        of your refusal         

16:49.242 --> 16:50.542
to wear the new postal uniform. 

16:50.610 --> 16:53.412
            Oh, gee,            
I wonder who reported me.       

16:53.480 --> 16:54.713
It was me, stupid.              

16:57.183 --> 16:59.551
That's the only reason I'd      
come in here on my day off      

16:59.619 --> 17:01.253
to see you                      
knuckle under.                  

17:01.321 --> 17:04.056
 Yeah, so, uh, what if I don't  
     wear this new uniform?     

17:04.124 --> 17:05.290
      Then I will have no choice

17:05.358 --> 17:07.459
            but to put you under
        immediate suspension.   

17:07.527 --> 17:09.194
Eh, you wouldn't do that.       

17:09.262 --> 17:10.462
      When I'm through with you,

17:10.530 --> 17:12.064
          you'll be lucky to get
        a job sticking flyers   

17:12.132 --> 17:13.265
        under windshield wipers.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.233
    Now what's it gonna be?     

17:15.300 --> 17:17.236
                  Oh, all right.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.070
              You win this time.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.040
        Hey, Paul,              

17:21.107 --> 17:23.041
guard the men's room door       
    for me, will you?           

17:23.108 --> 17:24.276
  I'm gonna be naked in there.  

17:24.344 --> 17:27.179
     Again?                     

17:29.282 --> 17:31.784
                 (both laughing)

17:31.851 --> 17:34.253
     Hook, line and sinker.     

17:34.320 --> 17:35.688
Hey, fellas, what's up?         

17:35.755 --> 17:38.657
Oh, Sam, I want you to meet     
my brother-in-law, Frank.       
            Hi, Sam.            

17:38.725 --> 17:40.492
             Frank.             
          Hey, what are you guys
                 trying to pull?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.461
Ah, I'm sick of Clavin          
shooting off his mouth          

17:42.529 --> 17:43.996
about the new                   
uniforms.                       

17:44.064 --> 17:45.264
He's never                      
even seen them,                 

17:45.331 --> 17:47.733
so we came up with              
our own Clavin version.         

17:47.801 --> 17:49.902
The old fake uniform gag.       
                        Yeah.   

17:49.969 --> 17:51.904
      Why didn't we think       
            of that?            

17:51.971 --> 17:53.972
     You know, I'm a little     
disappointed in all of us.      

17:54.040 --> 17:55.441
          I just think          
    we're gonna have to work    

17:55.508 --> 17:56.775
  a little harder around here.  

17:58.478 --> 18:00.346
    There you are, Rebecca.     

18:00.413 --> 18:01.780
                 Hello, Russell.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.916
Where you been?                 
                    Hiding...   

18:03.983 --> 18:05.818
I mean,                         
doing my taxes.                 

18:05.885 --> 18:07.119
             Russell, come here.
                I-I think you   

18:07.187 --> 18:08.787
              and I need to have
                  a little talk.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.789
Sure. I could talk              
to you all night.               

18:10.857 --> 18:12.458
In fact I have,                 

18:12.525 --> 18:14.426
                  in my own way.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.865
Uh, Russell, have a seat.       

18:19.933 --> 18:22.034
                Oh, you know,   
                        Rebecca,

18:22.102 --> 18:23.869
        I hope I didn't frighten
                  you last night

18:23.937 --> 18:25.838
          with my little tribute
            to you on the walls.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.506
Russell,                        

18:27.574 --> 18:29.008
     you have to stop this.     

18:29.075 --> 18:30.809
         I'm not worthy         
     of all this attention.     

18:30.877 --> 18:31.944
          I'm Rebecca.          

18:32.012 --> 18:33.712
    I'm nobody. I'm nothing.    

18:33.780 --> 18:35.381
        I know it, that's-that's
             what Carla told me.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.050
                And-and Cliff   
                    and-and Norm

18:38.118 --> 18:40.052
                    and Paul and
                Cousin Woody,   
Well, anyway...                 

18:40.120 --> 18:42.221
        Mr. Hill upstairs and   
            Ruben, the busboy...

18:42.288 --> 18:44.323
The point...                    

18:44.391 --> 18:47.159
     Russell, you're young,     

18:47.227 --> 18:49.328
    attractive and sensitive    
    and-and, you know,          

18:49.396 --> 18:51.563
there's just so many women      
    out there for you.          

18:52.899 --> 18:55.000
     I'm just not the one.      

18:55.068 --> 18:56.669
      Boy, I've-I've heard      
      this speech before.       

18:56.736 --> 18:57.703
            Just...             

18:57.771 --> 18:59.672
        just pipe down and...   

18:59.739 --> 19:01.373
             put some clothes on

19:01.441 --> 19:03.375
or we'll call Amtrak            
security, right?                

19:03.443 --> 19:05.377
Is that it?                     

19:05.445 --> 19:08.213
Is that the one?                

19:08.281 --> 19:12.017
        Yes, Russell, you pretty
            much said it for me.

19:12.085 --> 19:14.186
All right, I-I won't            
bother you anymore.             

19:14.254 --> 19:17.523
I-I guess my little songs       
and doodles                     

19:17.590 --> 19:20.359
could never have-have won       
the heart of a woman            

19:20.427 --> 19:23.395
as-as beautiful                 
and wonderful as you.           

19:23.463 --> 19:25.397
Shoot,                          
I'm a richer person             

19:25.465 --> 19:27.099
for having known you,           
Rebecca.                        

19:27.167 --> 19:29.902
You'll always be special.       

19:35.608 --> 19:37.576
             Phew.              

19:37.644 --> 19:39.845
Glad I don't have to deal       
    with that anymore.          

19:39.913 --> 19:43.849
     "I love you, Rebecca.      
     I love you, Rebecca."      

19:46.486 --> 19:49.421
         Who needs it?          

19:49.489 --> 19:51.423
         (whimpering):          
         I feel better.         

19:52.759 --> 19:54.493
     Any year now, Clavin!      

19:54.561 --> 19:55.594
                     I'm coming.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.229
                 I'm coming, for
                crying out loud.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.198
            Hold your horses.   

20:01.968 --> 20:03.569
    Well, I was wrong.          

20:03.636 --> 20:05.037
      This thing is great.      

20:05.105 --> 20:06.638
                    Well, uh,   

20:06.706 --> 20:08.607
you haven't                     
seen the hat.                   

20:10.110 --> 20:12.211
        Wow, all right.         

20:12.278 --> 20:14.980
     Now this is a uniform      
     that demands respect.      

20:15.048 --> 20:16.982
                Yes, sir.       

20:17.050 --> 20:18.650
         There's gonna          
    be one less reason          

20:18.718 --> 20:21.120
  to make fun of Cliff Clavin   
            tonight.            

20:27.660 --> 20:30.396
            No, no, Mrs. Clavin,
                it wasn't us.   

20:30.463 --> 20:32.731
     No, it was a couple of guys
        from the Post Office.   

20:32.799 --> 20:33.999
                Yeah, I know.   

20:34.067 --> 20:36.335
            I wish we could have
             thought of it, too.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.803
                It was, it...   

20:37.871 --> 20:39.304
                  You're kicking
                 yourself. Yeah.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.040
                     (laughs)   
                      Okay.     

20:41.107 --> 20:42.374
                Well, we'll talk
                to you later.   

20:42.442 --> 20:44.410
                      Bye-bye.  

20:44.477 --> 20:46.445
She's not exactly               
Donna Reed, is she?             

20:46.513 --> 20:47.546
                             No.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.415
                         No, no.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.083
              Sam,              

20:51.151 --> 20:52.518
  I've been in there thinking   
         about Russell.         

20:52.585 --> 20:54.586
I mean, what's wrong with       
somebody paying attention to me?

20:54.654 --> 20:56.655
    I mean, so he loves me,     
        is that a crime?        

20:56.723 --> 20:58.323
I'm gonna go talk to him.       

20:58.391 --> 20:59.992
     Somebody cover for me.     

21:00.060 --> 21:01.193
        Cover for what?         

21:01.261 --> 21:02.928
     You don't do anything      
          around here.          

21:02.996 --> 21:04.763
             Ha-ha.             

21:04.831 --> 21:07.733
  Seriously, what does she do   
      around here anyway?       

21:14.207 --> 21:16.075
      (loud music playing)      

21:18.178 --> 21:20.579
            Russell!            

21:22.682 --> 21:25.617
Russell, it's me, Rebecca!      

21:27.687 --> 21:30.622
Russell, I know you can hear me.

21:30.690 --> 21:34.626
     R-Russell, I was wrong     
    to turn you away.           

21:36.529 --> 21:38.464
            Russell!            

21:38.531 --> 21:39.531
         I'm coming in!         

21:39.599 --> 21:42.134
     I want you to give me      
        another chance!         

21:44.104 --> 21:46.038
        Oh, hi, Rebecca.        

21:49.743 --> 21:52.044
      Isn't Carla dreamy?       

21:53.305 --> 21:59.549
