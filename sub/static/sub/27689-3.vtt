00:36.800 --> 00:37.959
What are you doing?

00:55.960 --> 00:57.959
Have a good night. Take care.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.959
Thank you.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.959
- Come on.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.959
- They're still not leaving.
- None of them are going home.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.959
- I know. It's an absolute nightmare.
- Ah, listen to that. Come on!

01:06.960 --> 01:08.960
Come on!

01:14.320 --> 01:15.959
It's closed, right?

01:15.960 --> 01:17.959
You've got to go! You've got to go!

01:17.960 --> 01:20.418
You have got to get your friends
out of here now.

01:20.419 --> 01:21.960
Go!

01:32.652 --> 01:34.652
Get away from there!

01:54.492 --> 01:56.199
Lisa, we've got to get everyone
off the boat now.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.691
Just wait! Dani, where are you?

01:57.692 --> 01:59.652
I've been trying you for ages.

02:21.652 --> 02:23.651
- Is that Dani?
- Oh, my God!

02:23.652 --> 02:25.491
Dani!

02:25.492 --> 02:27.651
Dani's in the water!

02:27.652 --> 02:29.651
- Dani!
- Oh, my God...!

02:29.652 --> 02:31.651
Someone, do something!

02:31.652 --> 02:33.651
MOB, Kirsty!

02:33.652 --> 02:34.652
Dani!

02:34.653 --> 02:37.652
Mayday! Mayday!
Man overboard. Assistance required.

02:39.652 --> 02:41.652
- Dani!
- What's happened?

02:42.652 --> 02:44.652
- Dani!
- No!

02:55.332 --> 02:56.651
This way! Come on!

02:56.652 --> 02:58.651
Come on!

02:58.652 --> 03:00.163
Grab the pole! Grab it!

03:04.652 --> 03:06.652
Dani!

03:52.652 --> 03:54.692
There he is, the ray of sunshine.

03:57.425 --> 03:59.425
It's going to be hairnets at dawn.

04:01.501 --> 04:03.651
- Malcolm...
- Did he text you when I...?

04:03.652 --> 04:04.652
Aye, he did.

04:04.652 --> 04:05.652
Yes.

04:05.653 --> 04:07.171
How sure are you?

04:07.172 --> 04:09.491
Well, I wouldn't say it
if I wasn't sure, would I?

04:09.492 --> 04:10.651
There's strangulation marks.

04:10.652 --> 04:13.171
So, how soon can we make it official?

04:13.172 --> 04:17.012
Just as soon as that damn coroner
switches on their bloody mobile.

04:22.652 --> 04:24.651
Who called them, the coastguards?

04:24.652 --> 04:26.652
The skipper.
That's the fellow with the stripes.

04:27.652 --> 04:30.017
- Is he the one who found her?
- No, it was a bunch of lasses.

04:30.018 --> 04:31.990
They took some statements
and sent them home.

04:31.991 --> 04:34.173
- You what?
- To sober up.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.652
Oh...

04:36.167 --> 04:38.406
- Next-of-kin?
- Saw the whole thing.

04:38.407 --> 04:39.651
Er, saw the body.

04:39.652 --> 04:41.651
They think she felt in.

04:41.652 --> 04:44.651
The brother tried CPR,
cracking her ribcage.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.665
He would have killed her
if she wasn't already dead.

04:46.666 --> 04:50.651
Look, can you show
a bit more compassion, please?

04:50.652 --> 04:52.651
I think it was the brother-in-law.

04:52.652 --> 04:56.362
So, if anyone asks our position,
it's unexplained.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.652
Unexplained it is.

05:02.652 --> 05:04.652
Apart from the obvious, that is.

05:14.406 --> 05:16.651
Are we calling her Danielle or Dani?

05:16.652 --> 05:18.651
The family are using Dani.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.651
Then, that's what we'll use.

05:20.652 --> 05:22.107
Who moved her?

05:22.108 --> 05:24.287
Well, she was moved twice.

05:24.288 --> 05:27.651
Dragged on board and then
some guys carried her in here.

05:27.652 --> 05:30.083
They didn't want her to get cold,
apparently.

05:31.652 --> 05:34.652
The redness on the cheeks
is petechial haemorrhaging.

05:35.203 --> 05:37.012
The eyes will be the same.

05:37.483 --> 05:39.998
- Is that a headlock?
- No, I doubt it.

05:39.999 --> 05:41.652
More likely to be a...

05:42.163 --> 05:43.651
...squeezed throat.

05:43.652 --> 05:46.077
You see this here?
It's about the size of a thumb.

05:46.078 --> 05:47.171
Hm.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.261
I see it all the time
in domestic violence.

05:49.286 --> 05:50.651
Oh, aye.

05:50.652 --> 05:52.652
They just wanted to shut her up.

05:52.966 --> 05:55.651
There's a patch missing
on the scalp, too.

05:55.652 --> 05:57.652
Hm...

06:00.065 --> 06:02.651
Like dragged by her hair.

06:02.652 --> 06:04.011
And no-one noticed?

06:04.012 --> 06:05.652
Apparently not.

06:06.544 --> 06:08.248
What was this, a corporate?

06:08.273 --> 06:10.273
Yeah, her sister owns Varsey's.

06:11.123 --> 06:13.448
- Should I know it?
- Hair and beauty salon.

06:13.449 --> 06:14.843
There's quite a few of them.

06:16.652 --> 06:19.277
Right, so, the next question is...

06:19.278 --> 06:20.651
...when?

06:20.652 --> 06:22.027
I'd say less than 11 hours.

06:22.028 --> 06:24.651
The ambulance was called at 12:06am.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.651
Her sister went looking for her
on the deck

06:26.652 --> 06:28.651
and she heard some lasses scream.

06:28.652 --> 06:31.492
And that's when they saw the body
in the water.

06:32.397 --> 06:36.651
Right, so strangled and then dropped
or pushed into the water.

06:36.652 --> 06:38.883
Is that from the boat or the quay?

06:39.652 --> 06:40.652
The boat?

06:40.653 --> 06:42.851
The skipper said barely anybody had left.

06:42.852 --> 06:45.652
Right, well, we'll need to talk
to anyone who did leave.

06:47.172 --> 06:48.651
- Have we phoned for divers?
- Divers.

06:48.652 --> 06:49.652
Yeah.

06:51.551 --> 06:52.551
Poor lass.

06:56.652 --> 06:58.158
Do you want us to just
leave your guys to it?

06:58.183 --> 07:00.651
Oh, no, no. No, not yet.

07:00.652 --> 07:01.652
Erm...

07:03.652 --> 07:06.651
How do people normally end up
in the river?

07:06.652 --> 07:08.651
- Normally?
- Mm.

07:08.652 --> 07:10.651
Falls from land.

07:10.652 --> 07:13.651
Most riverside fatalities, people
are mucking about on the quay.

07:13.652 --> 07:14.652
Mm.

07:14.653 --> 07:16.486
Could she have gone in elsewhere?

07:16.487 --> 07:18.691
Didn't you say
they stopped off somewhere upriver?

07:18.692 --> 07:21.651
Yeah, a round trip
to a barbecue at a hotel.

07:21.652 --> 07:23.651
The Alanburn Manor.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.651
That's, what, 20 minutes?

07:25.652 --> 07:27.251
About that.

07:27.252 --> 07:29.950
I think, if she went in upriver,
she wouldn't have been found here.

07:29.951 --> 07:31.270
Why not?

07:31.271 --> 07:33.331
There's the current, the rain.

07:33.332 --> 07:35.651
A small body like hers would
have probably ended up in the sea.

07:35.652 --> 07:37.651
Well, if the tide was going out.

07:37.652 --> 07:40.492
She could have got dragged under
in the wake.

07:41.205 --> 07:42.525
But then the propeller could have...

07:43.652 --> 07:45.651
Er, she'd probably have
more obvious injuries.

07:45.652 --> 07:46.652
Mm.

07:50.652 --> 07:53.651
Have you come across
this lot before, the crew?

07:53.652 --> 07:57.407
No. The owner,
the man in pale blue trousers,

07:57.408 --> 07:59.281
he's not been in the business long.

07:59.282 --> 08:01.322
He's, er, using a lot of the lingo.

08:01.347 --> 08:03.651
- Mm.
- I get the impression he's...

08:03.652 --> 08:05.923
He's just covering his ignorance, hm?

08:07.339 --> 08:09.651
Anything else? Any corners cut?

08:09.652 --> 08:11.851
No, the refurb's fairly recent.

08:11.852 --> 08:14.103
All the safety equipment's up to date.

08:14.128 --> 08:15.179
Right.

08:16.179 --> 08:20.011
But again, there's muttering about
guests sneaking on their own drink.

08:20.012 --> 08:22.651
Oh, as in all their own fault?

08:22.652 --> 08:27.652
Now, what I've seen before is the
crew serving after licensing hours.

08:28.223 --> 08:30.011
It sounds like arses are being covered.

08:30.012 --> 08:31.885
- Get them up here, Kenny.
- Ma'am.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.039
Yeah, thanks, love.

08:37.365 --> 08:38.365
Thanks.

08:39.652 --> 08:43.250
Now, is this a list of invitees,
or who actually came?

08:43.251 --> 08:44.651
- Who was on board.
- Right.

08:44.652 --> 08:46.651
And could anyone else have got on?

08:46.652 --> 08:48.651
No, we check them on board.

08:48.652 --> 08:53.003
And did you check them back on board
after the stop-off at the barbecue?

08:53.652 --> 08:55.652
I can't say we did, no.

08:58.058 --> 08:59.652
Why do you take home addresses?

09:00.203 --> 09:02.651
- Belt and braces for insurance.
- Hm.

09:02.652 --> 09:04.851
What about crew?

09:04.852 --> 09:07.381
Well, it's just us and a few agency crew.

09:07.382 --> 09:08.863
When did they leave?

09:08.888 --> 09:10.651
I sent them home before
it all kicked off.

09:10.652 --> 09:12.651
Yeah, well, we will need
to talk to them, love.

09:12.652 --> 09:14.651
Yeah, well, the details
are back at the office.

09:14.652 --> 09:17.652
Yeah, well, make sure
we get them this morning.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.962
Er, was she hammered, do you think?

09:23.963 --> 09:26.651
I don't know. Was she? Did you see her?

09:26.652 --> 09:29.651
Well, I saw a lot of very drunk girls.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.651
It can get a bit Wild West.

09:31.652 --> 09:33.083
- We try our best.
- Yeah.

09:36.363 --> 09:37.652
Right.

09:44.652 --> 09:47.691
Right, get Mark on that CCTV
at the barbecue.

09:47.692 --> 09:50.651
I want to know exactly
who came back to Quayside.

09:50.652 --> 09:51.652
Will do.

09:51.653 --> 09:53.032
Now, who am I meeting?

09:53.033 --> 09:55.040
Oh, the lady with the dark hair is Sadie.

09:55.041 --> 09:57.651
- The victim's sister.
- The one who had the party?

09:57.652 --> 09:59.651
No, that's Lisa. Sadie didn't come.

09:59.652 --> 10:03.019
The redhead is Paula. Works
for Varsey's. Organised the do.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.426
Right. So, where's this Lisa?

10:05.427 --> 10:07.652
She had to be sedated and taken home.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.159
Right.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.652
- Have we got the victim's house keys?
- Sorted.

10:17.652 --> 10:19.652
Er, Sadie...

10:21.431 --> 10:23.951
I'm DCI Vera Stanhope.

10:24.172 --> 10:26.651
I'm so sorry for your loss, pet.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.445
I'm sorry.

10:33.652 --> 10:35.652
I just can't believe this is happening.

10:37.290 --> 10:38.651
Come on, love.

10:38.652 --> 10:40.651
Let's get you somewhere a bit quieter.

10:40.652 --> 10:43.003
- Come on.
- We've got a room upstairs.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.358
36.

10:47.805 --> 10:49.805
37 on April 30th.

10:50.652 --> 10:52.652
And she's a hairdresser.

10:53.752 --> 10:57.492
Yes, she's a branch manager
at Central Arcade.

10:58.298 --> 11:01.651
- I can show you the guest list.
- Yes, please.

11:01.652 --> 11:03.172
You see, that is what I don't get.

11:03.978 --> 11:07.298
There were loads of people there.
How did no-one see her fall in?

11:07.652 --> 11:10.651
Well, we will be speaking
to everyone, love.

11:10.652 --> 11:12.692
Did something go on?

11:13.852 --> 11:16.240
Now, we're waiting for the postmortem.

11:16.241 --> 11:17.651
That should clarify.

11:17.652 --> 11:19.652
That means yes, doesn't it?

11:20.652 --> 11:21.652
Something went on.

11:26.024 --> 11:29.403
Can you tell us what time
you last saw your sister?

11:30.351 --> 11:32.351
After the speeches.

11:32.376 --> 11:35.627
She was, erm, upset because
the boat had run out of booze.

11:35.652 --> 11:38.651
So... we took matters into our own hands

11:38.652 --> 11:40.651
and brought some bottles on
from the hotel.

11:40.652 --> 11:43.651
Right, so, you took on your own booze.

11:43.652 --> 11:47.651
And we'd complained to the crew,
but they'd done nothing.

11:47.652 --> 11:49.651
Have you asked Nial what happened?

11:49.652 --> 11:50.843
Who's Nial?

11:51.652 --> 11:53.243
Her boyfriend.

11:54.018 --> 11:56.018
Ask him if they had a falling-out.

11:56.872 --> 11:58.283
He was there, wasn't he?

11:59.652 --> 12:01.851
So, why would they have had
a falling-out?

12:01.852 --> 12:03.652
Because he's just...

12:04.258 --> 12:05.603
...horrible to her.

12:09.652 --> 12:10.652
Last night...

12:11.652 --> 12:12.723
No.

12:13.198 --> 12:16.198
The night before, us three went out.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.651
Dani just...

12:18.652 --> 12:19.652
...wasn't herself.

12:21.652 --> 12:23.651
I couldn't quite get it out of her.

12:23.652 --> 12:26.651
But I think she was trying to tell
me that Nial had been bullying her.

12:26.652 --> 12:27.691
Oh...

12:27.692 --> 12:30.652
What? It was before you'd got there.

12:33.652 --> 12:36.651
So, what did she say, exactly?

12:36.652 --> 12:38.652
Well, she wouldn't say it exactly.

12:40.325 --> 12:43.325
But she made a comment
about manipulative blokes,

12:43.358 --> 12:45.358
once they'd wheedled their way in.

12:45.383 --> 12:47.283
You can't just assume that was Nial.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.821
No, I think it was.

12:48.846 --> 12:51.166
I think she'd finally clocked onto him.

12:51.491 --> 12:53.171
She was trying to tell me.

12:54.652 --> 12:57.171
Of course we asked about her boyfriend.

12:57.172 --> 12:58.651
No-one mentioned it.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.281
OK, this is said on and off.

13:00.282 --> 13:01.903
So I'm giving you the
benefit of the doubt.

13:01.928 --> 13:03.687
Oh, very gracious of you!

13:03.688 --> 13:05.255
- Jac...
- They've found him.

13:05.256 --> 13:07.851
He works at Seretso Industries
near Hartlepool.

13:07.852 --> 13:10.723
Right, come on,
we're getting ourselves south.

13:36.438 --> 13:39.438
Try Nial with two Ls, just to be sure.

13:42.652 --> 13:45.651
- Sorry.
- Well, that's all right, Nial.

13:45.652 --> 13:46.852
It's a shock.

13:48.781 --> 13:52.651
This "unexplained"
means it wasn't an accident?

13:52.652 --> 13:55.651
No, it means we're looking at all angles.

13:55.652 --> 13:58.652
I wondered why she hadn't texted me. I...

14:00.652 --> 14:02.652
I was waiting for her to text me, but...

14:04.308 --> 14:05.851
...we'd had a falling-out on the boat.

14:05.852 --> 14:07.043
Oh?

14:08.345 --> 14:10.803
- What about?
- Her ignoring me.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.652
She was just focused on her family.

14:15.043 --> 14:17.011
Do you not get on with her family?

14:17.012 --> 14:18.652
They're all right.

14:19.005 --> 14:20.045
It's just...

14:20.692 --> 14:23.652
...everyone sucking up to Lisa
all the time, it does my head in.

14:24.652 --> 14:27.651
Anyway, I was supping up with them all.

14:27.652 --> 14:29.172
Dani was leaving me on my own.

14:30.318 --> 14:31.763
So, I stropped off at half-time.

14:32.652 --> 14:35.003
So, what was up with them, hm?

14:36.652 --> 14:38.302
I have no idea.

14:38.858 --> 14:39.858
She's never told me.

14:40.652 --> 14:43.843
- Now, what do you think it was?
- I don't know if it was...

14:46.652 --> 14:47.652
Look, er...

14:49.652 --> 14:52.492
She'd been acting funny
the last few weeks, right?

14:53.652 --> 14:55.923
She was on her laptop all the time,
fobbed me off about it.

14:59.172 --> 15:01.012
Maybe that was something worse.

15:05.652 --> 15:09.132
He reckons he got a taxi
from the barbecue.

15:09.133 --> 15:11.651
Fine. I told you. I'll check it out.

15:11.652 --> 15:14.651
They didn't have a clue who was on board.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.652
No wonder it was all a bit "Wild West".

15:18.172 --> 15:19.652
Come on, get in.

15:40.452 --> 15:43.243
There's a team leader standing in,
Megan Sibisi.

15:43.652 --> 15:46.652
- Do we know anything about her?
- Not yet.

15:47.018 --> 15:48.178
That's probably her.

15:48.652 --> 15:51.883
Right, have a chat with her,
get a feel for the place.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.652
- Where are you going?
- Dani's flat.

16:21.845 --> 16:23.845
Hello?

16:48.484 --> 16:49.683
All right.

16:49.684 --> 16:51.175
Well, there's no sign of a forced entry,

16:51.176 --> 16:53.784
so it could be we're looking
for something specific.

16:54.906 --> 16:57.483
Right, I want the data
off that alarm system.

16:57.484 --> 17:01.483
And I want a family member
to ID what's missing.

17:01.484 --> 17:02.840
Timeline.

17:02.841 --> 17:05.483
Now, then, the last known sightings
of our victim.

17:06.483 --> 17:09.483
There was one camera on the boat,
ma'am, near the bar.

17:11.483 --> 17:13.326
23:13.

17:13.327 --> 17:15.002
And what time did they get back?

17:15.003 --> 17:17.483
They left shortly after, so they
would have been on the Quayside

17:17.483 --> 17:19.743
between quarter to and midnight.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.236
And she's dead within an hour of this?

17:22.261 --> 17:23.441
Mm.

17:23.442 --> 17:25.483
What happened on that boat?

17:25.483 --> 17:28.483
I mean, where did she go?
It's not like it's the Queen Mary.

17:28.483 --> 17:30.483
We've asked people for photos
taken at the disco.

17:30.484 --> 17:31.777
Mm.

17:31.778 --> 17:34.843
And what time did this Lisa
start looking for her?

17:34.844 --> 17:38.484
Unclear. Er, apparently, she's still
too upset to be interviewed.

17:40.324 --> 17:42.163
Ma'am, sorry,
do you want the guest statements

17:42.164 --> 17:44.483
or the burglary prioritised?

17:44.484 --> 17:46.483
I want them both prioritised.

17:46.484 --> 17:48.976
Er, there were over 80-odd on the boat.

17:48.977 --> 17:50.683
Aye, on the Quayside.

17:50.684 --> 17:53.483
Drunks, passers-by,
late-night joggers, the lot.

17:53.484 --> 17:56.484
Where are we with the agency crew?

17:58.484 --> 18:00.483
Oh, for crying out loud!

18:00.484 --> 18:03.483
The skipper was supposed to send us
a list. Chase it up.

18:03.484 --> 18:05.483
I want to know, with absolute certainty,

18:05.484 --> 18:08.523
who was crewing that boat
when it got to Quayside.

18:08.524 --> 18:11.163
Casual workers on the waterways...

18:11.164 --> 18:12.729
It'll be hard to nail down, ma'am.

18:12.730 --> 18:15.484
Aye, well,
get out your biggest hammer, Kenny.

18:16.150 --> 18:19.150
Now, the last 12 hours of her life.

18:19.350 --> 18:22.350
She went to Lisa's to get ready
at around five yesterday.

18:22.375 --> 18:24.459
- Mark, get up.
- Oh, sorry, ma'am.

18:24.484 --> 18:26.843
It's the vehicle sweep at the hotel.

18:26.844 --> 18:30.173
We've found the cab that took
the boyfriend back to his flat.

18:30.174 --> 18:33.484
He left when he said he did
and went to Yarm.

18:35.484 --> 18:38.484
Well, that's a long way to go
in a cab, isn't it?

18:39.484 --> 18:41.483
I mean that's 20 or 30 miles.

18:41.484 --> 18:43.483
It's got to be 50 quid.

18:43.484 --> 18:45.484
He must have been desperate to get away.

18:46.484 --> 18:47.684
Hm.

19:12.423 --> 19:14.423
Can you see what's missing
in this picture?

19:17.484 --> 19:18.706
Shall I explain it to you?

19:18.707 --> 19:20.660
There's no foam in the nasal passages,

19:20.661 --> 19:22.770
meaning she didn't struggle for breath,

19:22.771 --> 19:25.584
meaning that she was probably
unconscious when she hit the water.

19:27.090 --> 19:28.483
Well, you got that in one.

19:28.484 --> 19:30.928
Now, are there any propeller injuries

19:30.929 --> 19:32.683
that weren't evident earlier?

19:32.684 --> 19:35.323
- No.
- So, didn't travel.

19:35.324 --> 19:37.886
Oh, I wouldn't listen to that Marine
woman. She didn't have a clue.

19:37.887 --> 19:39.483
She has a name.

19:39.484 --> 19:41.164
Yes, well, I didn't take to her myself.

19:41.895 --> 19:43.993
So, the upside is we have recovered

19:43.994 --> 19:46.163
a substantial amount of DNA material,

19:46.164 --> 19:48.143
particularly from under the fingernails.

19:48.144 --> 19:49.483
The downside is we have...

19:49.484 --> 19:52.483
Discovered a substantial
amount of DNA material.

19:52.484 --> 19:54.483
So, it'll take time
to de-scramble it all.

19:54.484 --> 19:57.483
Bear with us.
But like I said, definitely murder.

19:58.485 --> 20:01.483
Oh... We've got to crack on.

20:01.484 --> 20:03.984
Right.
Er, so I can break it to the family?

20:05.485 --> 20:07.484
You see,
that's the bit I couldn't stomach.

20:08.484 --> 20:10.483
That's the bit I, erm...

20:10.484 --> 20:11.844
Well, I...

20:12.844 --> 20:14.844
I take my hat off to you.

20:17.196 --> 20:18.484
Door.

20:21.484 --> 20:24.483
15 million for hairdressing?

20:24.484 --> 20:26.483
That's turnover, not profit.

20:26.484 --> 20:28.483
- What, accounting for the taxman?
- Not necessarily.

20:28.484 --> 20:31.483
There's 200-odd employees.
That's a lot of wages to pay.

20:31.484 --> 20:35.484
Well, that business studies degree
finally came in handy.

20:39.484 --> 20:41.003
They've been raking it in.

20:41.004 --> 20:44.003
Oh, there's a boom in Botox, is there?

20:44.004 --> 20:47.483
Well, it's just what we need
to reverse industrial decline.

20:47.484 --> 20:49.483
To be fair,
she does a lot of work for charity.

20:49.484 --> 20:51.843
What, as in feeding the homeless?

20:51.844 --> 20:54.484
Or giving parties for her rich friends?

20:55.164 --> 20:56.523
Look, I don't begrudge anyone.

20:56.524 --> 20:58.483
Not if they've grafted.

20:58.484 --> 21:00.177
Well, money won't soften the blow,
will it?

21:00.178 --> 21:02.844
No. It'll buy them a good lawyer, though.

21:06.603 --> 21:07.763
You were right.

21:09.484 --> 21:10.710
No, Lisa.

21:10.711 --> 21:12.743
When I saw her body, she didn't...

21:12.744 --> 21:15.523
I mean, how? Did someone get on the boat?

21:15.524 --> 21:18.483
Well, it's a possibility, yes.

21:18.484 --> 21:19.864
I thought they checked people.

21:21.069 --> 21:22.069
Yeah.

21:23.403 --> 21:26.403
Can I ask, when did you first
notice she was missing?

21:28.844 --> 21:30.484
Was it when the cab called?

21:31.484 --> 21:34.484
Yeah, the cab called Paula.

21:35.350 --> 21:37.350
We must have nearly got to Quayside.

21:38.096 --> 21:40.064
I went to find her, tried the ladies,

21:40.109 --> 21:41.775
she wasn't on the dance floor.

21:41.806 --> 21:43.484
Do you have an idea of the time?

21:45.264 --> 21:46.483
Shall I...?

21:46.484 --> 21:48.483
Shall I check on when the cab called me?

21:48.484 --> 21:50.484
Aye, that'd be useful, love.

22:02.004 --> 22:03.484
She was supposed to sleep here.

22:06.004 --> 22:09.004
She hated going back
to an empty flat after a night out.

22:22.484 --> 22:24.483
OK.

22:24.484 --> 22:27.483
Well, it's an obvious one, this, but...

22:27.484 --> 22:30.483
...had your sister fallen out
with anyone?

22:30.484 --> 22:32.843
No. She didn't have fallings-out.

22:32.844 --> 22:35.250
You're not understanding
what she was like.

22:35.251 --> 22:37.104
I mean, she wasn't confrontational.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.484
She's very trusting, very naive.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.483
Tell her what you told me
about Nial, will you?

22:42.484 --> 22:43.880
I've told her.

22:43.881 --> 22:46.323
Come on, Lise.
You're not going to hurt her.

22:46.324 --> 22:49.483
Were there any other fellas in her life?

22:49.484 --> 22:50.843
- No.
- No.

22:50.844 --> 22:52.483
No, she'd never cheat.

22:52.484 --> 22:54.003
Though he might.

22:54.004 --> 22:55.484
I don't think he would.

22:56.224 --> 22:58.323
What? I don't like the fella,
but I don't think he...

22:58.324 --> 22:59.784
Why don't you like him?

23:02.164 --> 23:05.483
Nial's one of those who has an issue
with us having a bit of cash.

23:05.484 --> 23:07.089
We get that a lot.

23:07.090 --> 23:08.483
Dani just...

23:08.484 --> 23:10.824
...never saw the dark side in anyone.

23:11.879 --> 23:14.483
She gave everyone
the benefit of the doubt.

23:14.484 --> 23:17.215
What can we do?
Do we do a press conference?

23:17.216 --> 23:19.843
- What?
- Erm, I'd leave it to us for now.

23:19.844 --> 23:21.484
Yeah. And, er...

23:22.019 --> 23:24.483
...you might want to prepare yourselves.

23:24.484 --> 23:26.484
It might be a long haul.

23:40.484 --> 23:43.164
Right, you're going to need these
on your feet.

23:51.484 --> 23:53.484
She'd hate it like this.

23:53.863 --> 23:56.223
- Am I allowed to...?
- Er, no, love.

23:57.864 --> 24:00.484
Now, can you notice anything missing?

24:01.970 --> 24:04.290
Why didn't the alarm go off
when they got in?

24:04.315 --> 24:06.943
Lisa just spent a fortune
upgrading security.

24:06.968 --> 24:08.147
Hm?

24:08.148 --> 24:10.484
Not just here, but at all the properties.

24:12.017 --> 24:14.177
Anything not here that should be?

24:14.890 --> 24:15.890
Erm...

24:26.850 --> 24:28.850
Er, her daytime handbag.

24:29.930 --> 24:32.184
And, erm, a laptop.

24:32.662 --> 24:35.006
Like, a posh one.

24:35.048 --> 24:36.324
A thin one.

24:36.894 --> 24:38.280
Right, anything else?

24:38.281 --> 24:41.483
I know you think I've been clutching
at straws, but I don't trust Nial.

24:41.484 --> 24:44.483
Well, I won't judge you
for speculating, love.

24:44.484 --> 24:47.483
No, you see,
I've been thinking and thinking

24:47.484 --> 24:50.224
and a couple of weeks ago
Dani asked me about life insurance.

24:50.850 --> 24:52.850
That was so unlike her.

24:52.875 --> 24:55.584
She never did, like,
pensions or anything.

24:56.484 --> 24:58.484
So, what if that came from Nial?

24:59.184 --> 25:02.584
Now, do you know this, love,
or are you just inferring?

25:04.484 --> 25:06.483
I'm just trying to make sense of it.

25:06.484 --> 25:09.704
Now, why was the security upgraded?

25:11.050 --> 25:12.370
Pilfering, I think.

25:12.395 --> 25:14.825
Oh, is that a big issue in the business?

25:14.914 --> 25:17.064
There are always issues in the business.

25:17.524 --> 25:20.484
That much money, that many women...

25:22.390 --> 25:23.910
It's a nest of vipers.

25:26.484 --> 25:31.483
Right, so, the alarm was turned off
at 18:02, then reset at 18:18.

25:31.484 --> 25:34.145
Well, that's when she was getting
ready at the sister's.

25:34.146 --> 25:36.683
Now, if that's not inside
information, I'll eat my hat.

25:36.684 --> 25:38.483
Or the family. Or the boyfriend.

25:38.484 --> 25:40.483
- Or someone in the business.
- Hm.

25:40.484 --> 25:43.483
See if they can find out
what she was up to online,

25:43.484 --> 25:45.484
if that's possible.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.283
And check her bank accounts.

25:48.484 --> 25:50.135
If there's big money floating around,

25:50.136 --> 25:51.824
it causes all types of trouble.

25:52.524 --> 25:55.003
Now, will you just give us 30 seconds?

25:55.004 --> 25:56.523
You know they've found out
all the clothes

25:56.524 --> 25:59.050
are collected by slave labour
in these shops?

25:59.051 --> 26:02.168
Well, organised crime gets its
fingers everywhere, doesn't it?

26:02.169 --> 26:03.843
Even in good causes.

26:07.484 --> 26:08.790
Kenny?

26:08.791 --> 26:11.483
Background checks
have thrown us a bone, ma'am.

26:11.484 --> 26:14.484
Yeah, the skipper and his daughter
reported a woman for harassment.

26:40.996 --> 26:42.676
Yes?

26:43.484 --> 26:44.484
Yes?!

26:45.484 --> 26:49.483
Oh, er, we're police officers,
Mrs Anwell.

26:49.484 --> 26:52.175
I'm DCI Stanhope. This is DS Healy.

26:52.176 --> 26:53.484
Can we come in?

26:54.484 --> 26:56.483
Sorry, no.

26:56.484 --> 26:58.483
No, hang on! Hang on! Er...

26:58.484 --> 27:01.483
Well, how about outside the house
in the open,

27:01.484 --> 27:02.761
would that be better?

27:02.762 --> 27:04.483
Just a quick chat.

27:04.484 --> 27:05.584
Oh...!

27:06.484 --> 27:08.483
Do I look like I could harass anyone?

27:08.484 --> 27:12.090
Well, maybe someone's
got their wires crossed, love.

27:12.091 --> 27:14.483
I mean, I confronted them, yes.

27:14.484 --> 27:16.683
Because I just wanted
to get a straight answer.

27:16.684 --> 27:19.824
- Answer?
- Because you lot did nothing.

27:20.484 --> 27:22.483
They give you a leaflet
and that's about it.

27:22.484 --> 27:24.117
Sorry, what should we have done?

27:24.118 --> 27:26.119
- When?
- Arrested them.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.483
For...

27:27.484 --> 27:29.484
...I don't know, accessories.

27:30.892 --> 27:34.483
They're tipping off burglars
when houses are empty.

27:34.484 --> 27:36.483
Oh...!

27:36.484 --> 27:37.984
- Right!
- Yes.

27:38.484 --> 27:40.483
Ask anyone at the wedding.

27:40.484 --> 27:44.483
They made sure we're all
safely stuck out on the water

27:44.484 --> 27:47.483
and then they had some lads
do the place over.

27:47.484 --> 27:51.483
Look, I'm sorry you've been burgled,
love, but...

27:51.484 --> 27:53.324
It's just as well, I was out.

27:54.096 --> 27:55.256
If I'd been here...

27:56.060 --> 27:57.483
...it doesn't bear thinking about.

27:57.484 --> 28:00.483
Look, I know it's disconcerting
and I do understand.

28:00.484 --> 28:01.484
I do.

28:01.485 --> 28:04.323
But you know this because...?

28:04.324 --> 28:05.984
Because it's obvious!

28:06.684 --> 28:08.145
Ring the other guests.

28:08.146 --> 28:11.824
They took all our names
and addresses for no good reason.

28:12.484 --> 28:14.684
Now, why else would they need them?

28:16.303 --> 28:19.303
Get on to Neighbourhood
about patterns of burglaries,

28:19.328 --> 28:21.328
see if any bells are ringing.

28:21.484 --> 28:23.483
Do you want us to get the skipper in
for an interview?

28:23.484 --> 28:24.890
No, no. Not yet.

28:24.891 --> 28:27.863
Let's get her into dry dock first
and see what we find.

28:27.864 --> 28:29.483
So, what are we thinking?

28:29.484 --> 28:32.083
They pass addresses on to a third party,

28:32.084 --> 28:34.483
Dani somehow clocks they're onto it,

28:34.484 --> 28:37.483
and they find a quiet place
on the boat to shut her up?

28:37.484 --> 28:39.484
Yeah, but is that motive, though?

28:40.357 --> 28:41.357
Hm?

28:41.382 --> 28:43.902
I mean, to kill a lass
just to protect some housebreakers?

28:43.927 --> 28:46.407
It could be leading to something
bigger, organised gangs.

28:46.432 --> 28:48.432
There was two burglaries.

28:48.457 --> 28:51.457
There could be a bit of a thread.

28:51.484 --> 28:53.821
- What have you got, love?
- I've come up trumps for you.

28:53.822 --> 28:56.483
Yeah? What, blood and confessions, then?

28:56.484 --> 28:59.483
No, I don't like to make it too easy.

28:59.484 --> 29:00.523
I've only got underwater photos but,

29:00.524 --> 29:02.444
until we get her into dry
dock, it'll have to do.

29:02.469 --> 29:03.548
Right.

29:05.484 --> 29:07.239
And where was this found?

29:07.240 --> 29:10.483
Your divers found it snagged
on modifications to the hull.

29:10.484 --> 29:11.484
What do you mean?

29:14.684 --> 29:17.034
There's four clamps on the underside.

29:17.035 --> 29:19.003
These scraps of cloth
were caught on them.

29:19.004 --> 29:21.164
It matches the top she was wearing.

29:23.484 --> 29:26.155
So, her clothes got caught up
on one of these.

29:26.156 --> 29:27.484
Mm.

29:28.036 --> 29:29.483
What are they for?

29:29.484 --> 29:31.483
Well, that's the question.

29:31.484 --> 29:32.944
I've never come across it.

29:33.430 --> 29:34.435
An educated guess,

29:34.436 --> 29:37.384
I'd say it would be to attach, like,
a storage container.

29:38.203 --> 29:40.624
But it's bizarre to put it
somewhere so inaccessible.

29:41.844 --> 29:43.483
Unless they're transporting something

29:43.484 --> 29:45.004
they might want to conceal.

29:56.202 --> 29:58.201
- Is that my boat?
- Aye.

29:58.202 --> 30:00.202
The underbelly, so to speak.

30:02.202 --> 30:05.410
Now, what are these for, hm?

30:06.202 --> 30:09.201
Only, they're not mentioned
on your certification.

30:09.202 --> 30:13.010
So, I'm guessing they were added
in the last year.

30:14.921 --> 30:16.921
We keep the addresses for insurance.

30:17.202 --> 30:18.202
Honestly, ask my dad.

30:18.203 --> 30:21.201
Well, could you have passed
the information on inadvertently?

30:21.202 --> 30:23.721
- To who?
- Well...

30:23.722 --> 30:26.202
...someone connected
to organised criminality.

30:26.763 --> 30:29.763
We don't know organised criminals.

30:29.788 --> 30:30.788
OK.

30:31.202 --> 30:35.042
Can I show you an image
from under your boat?

30:36.202 --> 30:37.401
So, what's your sideline, Eddie?

30:37.402 --> 30:39.201
What have you got yourself mixed up in?

30:39.202 --> 30:41.637
- I never went through with it.
- No?

30:41.638 --> 30:44.561
Some fella approached me out of
the blue, offered me a good fee.

30:44.562 --> 30:46.721
So, I got the clamps sorted out.

30:46.722 --> 30:48.553
I never saw him again.

30:48.554 --> 30:50.943
Oh, the criminal
who disappears into thin air.

30:50.944 --> 30:53.129
I've never come across
one of them before!

30:53.130 --> 30:54.282
Check my mobile.

30:54.283 --> 30:57.579
I must have texted him 20-odd times.

30:57.580 --> 30:59.201
Oh, you were up for it, then?

30:59.202 --> 31:00.410
I was having a bad time.

31:01.490 --> 31:03.202
And, well, I...

31:04.202 --> 31:06.561
I wanted to get one over on the boss.

31:06.562 --> 31:08.485
I've never even seen this.

31:08.486 --> 31:11.201
There's got to be
some kind of explanation.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.201
Your father admitted
to being approached by someone

31:13.202 --> 31:15.202
trying to import goods illegally.

31:17.330 --> 31:19.201
Oh...

31:19.202 --> 31:21.201
God, this is going to ruin everything.

31:21.202 --> 31:24.201
Does Richard have to know about this?

31:24.202 --> 31:26.201
Only, he's bailed us out enough already.

31:26.202 --> 31:29.201
Oh, he bought us up when we were broke.

31:29.202 --> 31:32.201
Acted like a mate,
got to know the ropes kind of and...

31:32.202 --> 31:33.881
Well, then he took us over.

31:33.882 --> 31:35.201
We did the work.

31:35.202 --> 31:37.201
He took the profit.

31:37.202 --> 31:40.410
This is me trying to make back
what's mine.

31:41.202 --> 31:42.202
And I...

31:43.722 --> 31:45.202
I never went through with it.

31:48.042 --> 31:50.201
Why didn't the broker see this?

31:50.202 --> 31:52.201
Well, we think these were added

31:52.202 --> 31:54.201
subsequent to you acquiring the boat.

31:54.202 --> 31:55.882
Is this Eddie?

31:58.610 --> 32:00.201
What's he been up to?

32:00.202 --> 32:02.882
What's your main line of work, Richard?

32:03.330 --> 32:06.202
I invest in businesses
I think will make money.

32:07.202 --> 32:08.202
Mainly hospitality.

32:08.203 --> 32:12.201
Oh, so, if they're on their last
legs, you see an opportunity.

32:12.202 --> 32:15.010
If I think I can turn
the business round, yeah.

32:15.402 --> 32:18.202
Booze cruises up the Tyne
seemed like a no-brainer, didn't it?

32:19.538 --> 32:20.916
It shows how much I know.

32:20.917 --> 32:23.201
I'm supposed to be sunning myself
in the Med right now.

32:23.202 --> 32:26.570
Can you shed any light
on what happened on Saturday?

32:28.448 --> 32:29.448
Yeah.

32:31.095 --> 32:33.055
Yeah, they were completely understaffed.

32:33.810 --> 32:35.201
No agency crew turned up.

32:35.202 --> 32:38.610
Are you saying it was just
the skipper and his daughter?

32:39.202 --> 32:42.450
They rang me to tell me they weren't
legal to sail and, er...

32:44.722 --> 32:47.202
...I put pressure on them
to go ahead anyway.

32:47.890 --> 32:50.850
I've... I've put so much money
into this damn thing.

32:51.202 --> 32:55.202
I thought, if we let down Varsey's,
it might bury us.

32:56.202 --> 32:57.467
They put so much business my way.

32:57.468 --> 33:00.201
And you didn't think
to get yourself down here to help?

33:00.202 --> 33:02.810
In the circumstances, I wish I had, yes.

33:03.202 --> 33:05.930
But, I'm... I'm not qualified.

33:10.515 --> 33:11.515
Listen...

33:14.842 --> 33:15.842
I watched them.

33:17.202 --> 33:19.201
I'm embarrassed to say it because it...

33:19.202 --> 33:20.553
...it's not my style.

33:21.730 --> 33:23.882
But I put an extra camera
in the steering room.

33:24.722 --> 33:26.202
To keep an eye.

33:39.202 --> 33:41.881
Oh, aye, there's a surprise.

33:41.882 --> 33:45.178
Now, you didn't disclose to us
that you'd spoken to her.

33:45.179 --> 33:46.290
Now, why's that?

33:46.722 --> 33:48.201
Cos I barely did.

33:48.202 --> 33:51.050
She just asked me
if she could speak to management.

33:51.402 --> 33:54.201
She wanted to complain.
I was just trying...

33:54.202 --> 33:56.201
To cover the fact
that you only had half the crew

33:56.202 --> 33:57.770
you needed to legally set sail.

34:00.202 --> 34:01.202
I'm sorry.

34:01.203 --> 34:03.201
I just knew that we had nothing
to do with her falling in,

34:03.202 --> 34:05.770
so I didn't want questions.

34:06.202 --> 34:09.201
We've been rescued from the brink.
I was just looking out for my dad.

34:09.202 --> 34:12.201
Oh, don't give me that.
Now, look at her, love.

34:12.202 --> 34:15.539
That's not someone concerned
about a bar running dry.

34:15.540 --> 34:16.992
I don't know anything.

34:16.993 --> 34:18.882
Look at her!

34:25.202 --> 34:27.202
Hardly spoke to her, apparently.

34:28.202 --> 34:32.908
Look, I know it looks bad she failed
to mention she'd even met her.

34:32.909 --> 34:35.201
We know they're involved
in criminal activity.

34:35.202 --> 34:37.201
And I could put together a picture

34:37.202 --> 34:39.841
of how Dani saw something
she shouldn't and paid the price.

34:39.842 --> 34:42.650
But... somehow I just...

34:44.050 --> 34:46.201
I just don't think
they had anything to do with it.

34:46.202 --> 34:48.639
Well, the NCA have got no intelligence

34:48.639 --> 34:50.797
linking them to organised activity,
either.

34:50.799 --> 34:52.880
Then, maybe we've found it for them.

34:52.882 --> 34:55.732
- It's possible, but...
- I spoke to Neighbourhood.

34:55.733 --> 34:58.664
And they reckon this burglary
at Patricia's was opportunistic.

34:58.665 --> 34:59.918
Regulars, maybe.

34:59.919 --> 35:01.746
They just took stuff they could grab.

35:01.747 --> 35:04.487
Whereas Dani's break-in
was more targeted.

35:04.488 --> 35:05.540
Exactly.

35:05.541 --> 35:08.679
They didn't take any other stuff
of value. No forensic traces.

35:08.680 --> 35:10.452
So, to me,
that sounds like it's professional.

35:10.453 --> 35:13.158
Ah, professional!
It doesn't mean anything.

35:13.159 --> 35:15.690
There's burglary tutorials
on the Internet these days.

35:16.562 --> 35:18.697
But I take your point.

35:18.698 --> 35:20.202
It may not be related.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.770
Different MO, different people.

35:25.202 --> 35:30.041
Oh, is there anything on that boat
that links them to this murder?

35:30.042 --> 35:32.201
- They are trying.
- Yeah.

35:32.202 --> 35:34.202
Well, let's see what they've got.

35:36.202 --> 35:38.850
They've upturned everything,
bar taking apart the engine.

35:40.202 --> 35:42.570
Well, they'll just have to keep looking.

35:43.882 --> 35:45.201
How did that get damaged?

35:45.202 --> 35:47.201
When those girls
released the mooring ropes,

35:47.202 --> 35:48.241
it banged into the quay.

35:48.242 --> 35:50.201
I think that's what dislodged the body

35:50.202 --> 35:52.202
from where it was caught on the clamps.

36:05.523 --> 36:08.736
So, if her body was trapped under here...

36:09.523 --> 36:13.610
...could she not have gone into
the water en route, like I said?

36:15.349 --> 36:16.349
It's possible.

36:17.523 --> 36:18.523
Yes.

36:18.524 --> 36:19.932
Sorry.

36:19.933 --> 36:23.522
Right, so we could have
missed something upriver.

36:23.523 --> 36:25.522
We need a search of the embankments.

36:25.523 --> 36:27.882
It may be the reason
we're not finding evidence.

36:27.883 --> 36:30.363
Aye, looking at the wrong crime scene.

36:40.690 --> 36:43.842
Now, ladies and gentlemen, can I ask
you all to stop what you're doing?

36:43.843 --> 36:46.522
Drop everything and make your way
to the lobby, please.

36:46.523 --> 36:48.522
- What's going on?
- This is a crime scene now.

36:48.523 --> 36:50.929
You go down there.
If you find anything, let me know.

36:50.930 --> 36:52.939
You guys, go that way. And best of luck.

36:52.940 --> 36:54.523
Off you go. Go, go, go.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.383
Kenny...

37:07.090 --> 37:08.522
Keep an eye on those two.

37:08.523 --> 37:10.522
I don't want them sailing off
into the sunset.

37:10.523 --> 37:13.591
I need to know exactly
where that boat was moored.

37:13.592 --> 37:16.522
- And what about the contraband issue?
- Well, tip off Customs.

37:16.523 --> 37:18.881
- They can push him on his contacts.
- Er...

37:18.882 --> 37:20.522
- What else can I do?
- Ma'am...

37:20.523 --> 37:22.522
A couple of clamps
is not evidence, Kenny.

37:22.523 --> 37:24.970
The family have done
a social media appeal.

37:26.089 --> 37:28.089
You are kidding me!

37:31.222 --> 37:34.222
'Someone must know the truth
of what happened to my sister.'

37:34.523 --> 37:37.523
Looking at the comments,
I think it's snowballed.

37:38.523 --> 37:40.522
Now, did they reveal anything
they shouldn't have?

37:40.523 --> 37:42.350
Things only the killer might have known?

37:42.375 --> 37:43.522
I don't think so.

37:43.523 --> 37:45.522
But it has produced a witness.

37:45.523 --> 37:47.930
- What, linked to the suspects?
- Linked to the victim.

37:48.523 --> 37:50.522
Someone who saw her
the night before she died.

37:50.523 --> 37:53.523
Now, is this a real witness
or a time-waster?

37:54.523 --> 37:56.522
OK. Call Aiden.

37:56.523 --> 37:59.043
- Tell him to meet us there.
- All right.

38:04.762 --> 38:05.890
Ma'am...

38:12.409 --> 38:14.409
You're the detectives, aren't you?

38:16.203 --> 38:17.523
Well, your...

38:17.869 --> 38:19.523
...picture's on the web page.

38:27.523 --> 38:30.970
She was stood out there a good
15 minutes, just staring at us.

38:32.883 --> 38:35.087
- What time was this?
- Late.

38:35.088 --> 38:36.202
11-ish.

38:36.203 --> 38:38.523
We were here all night,
changing the display.

38:39.349 --> 38:41.349
She took a photo of outside.

38:41.374 --> 38:45.374
Have any of these shops
ever been hairdressers?

38:45.523 --> 38:47.522
No. Nothing that high-end.

38:47.523 --> 38:50.522
- Does anyone here know her?
- No. I asked.

38:50.523 --> 38:52.522
No-one had clapped eyes on her
until then.

38:52.523 --> 38:55.522
I wouldn't have remembered
if I'd not seen the appeal.

38:55.523 --> 38:56.765
Did you speak to her?

38:56.766 --> 38:58.042
No.

38:58.043 --> 39:00.523
I went outside
to see if she was all right, but...

39:01.131 --> 39:03.523
...when she saw me coming,
she just got in the car and left.

39:04.568 --> 39:07.355
Run her plates through the cameras
on Gladstone Road

39:07.356 --> 39:08.882
around 11pm on Friday.

39:08.883 --> 39:11.202
Yeah, 24 hours before time of death.

39:11.203 --> 39:13.523
OK, Jac. We're on our way.

39:14.223 --> 39:17.522
Look, I don't care
how many brides are turning up!

39:17.523 --> 39:19.523
They're shutting the whole thing down.

39:22.523 --> 39:25.523
So, her car was near here
about the time the lady said.

39:26.523 --> 39:27.523
So, she came here direct,

39:27.524 --> 39:29.485
after having a drink with
her sister and the mate.

39:29.510 --> 39:30.522
Right.

39:30.523 --> 39:33.522
They've found hairs
close to where the boat was moored.

39:33.523 --> 39:35.722
It was just, like, down to here.

39:35.723 --> 39:37.523
DC Williams...

39:40.050 --> 39:42.203
Has she told us what we need to know?

39:42.204 --> 39:44.890
- Yes, ma'am.
- Then, get her off the crime scene.

39:45.563 --> 39:47.722
Well, at least we can rule her out
as a suspect.

39:47.723 --> 39:49.522
- What?
- The spycam.

39:49.523 --> 39:52.522
Her and her dad are in the cabin
for the duration they're moored up.

39:52.523 --> 39:53.523
Neither get off the boat.

39:54.723 --> 39:57.363
- What, not even for a few minutes?
- No.

40:01.203 --> 40:03.882
Let's say the barbecue is winding up.

40:03.883 --> 40:05.850
- It'll be dark.
- Mm-hm.

40:06.523 --> 40:08.523
People go back on board.

40:09.523 --> 40:10.930
And she comes...

40:11.523 --> 40:13.130
...down here.

40:15.416 --> 40:17.416
Oh, the poor lass.

40:17.523 --> 40:21.523
The last moments of her life,
pegged out like dot to dot.

40:22.914 --> 40:27.130
Right, so, let's say the first
confrontation happens here.

40:28.435 --> 40:30.435
But most of the encounter...

40:31.945 --> 40:33.043
...happens here.

40:33.490 --> 40:34.522
Hm?

40:34.523 --> 40:40.522
Maybe she tried to run off
and she is dragged back by her hair.

40:40.523 --> 40:43.362
All the way down here

40:43.363 --> 40:46.250
she is dragged to the water's edge...

40:47.196 --> 40:48.690
...where she's strangled...

40:50.436 --> 40:54.436
...and dropped into the water
with her heart still beating.

40:57.523 --> 40:59.523
Why did no-one hear her scream?

41:00.323 --> 41:01.450
The engine revving up.

41:03.043 --> 41:05.090
Some kind of noise from the boat.

41:06.523 --> 41:08.523
The disco starting up.

41:10.276 --> 41:11.850
Aye, the disco.

41:14.043 --> 41:17.522
So, she's dropped off the bottles
of booze and gets back off.

41:17.523 --> 41:20.250
And she's come back along here...

41:21.252 --> 41:22.522
...to meet her killer.

41:22.523 --> 41:23.970
Meanwhile...

41:24.883 --> 41:26.770
...the gangplank's pulled up.

41:29.523 --> 41:31.363
Dumped into the river...

41:31.949 --> 41:36.498
...and she gets caught on the bottom
of the boat as it passes over her.

41:36.970 --> 41:38.883
What makes her get off?

41:39.370 --> 41:41.876
The boyfriend leaving at half-time?

41:41.877 --> 41:44.522
- He would have known the alarm.
- Aye, he did.

41:44.523 --> 41:47.883
And he hinted at some affair, didn't he?

41:49.523 --> 41:52.522
So, is that what all this says?

41:52.523 --> 41:55.723
A couple's row that turns nasty?

41:56.069 --> 41:57.869
I mean, this...

41:58.683 --> 42:00.683
...this is rage, isn't it?

42:01.523 --> 42:03.810
But dropping her in the water...

42:04.563 --> 42:06.523
...that's calculated.

42:08.363 --> 42:09.522
Now, there are other ways.

42:09.523 --> 42:11.690
He could have given her a smack
and then walked off.

42:12.523 --> 42:14.362
But, no.

42:14.363 --> 42:16.563
Whoever did this
made sure the job was done.

42:18.130 --> 42:20.522
A random attack, that doesn't appeal?

42:20.523 --> 42:22.522
Oh, it's possible, of course.

42:22.523 --> 42:25.522
It's possible a psychopath
just happened to be passing by.

42:25.523 --> 42:26.650
It's public access.

42:28.316 --> 42:30.316
Ah, no, you're right.

42:31.523 --> 42:34.522
Maybe the poor lass just walked

42:34.523 --> 42:36.978
headlong into something without a clue.

42:36.979 --> 42:38.522
Ma'am...

42:38.523 --> 42:39.523
Kenny called.

42:39.524 --> 42:41.523
We think we've found her bag.

42:53.523 --> 42:57.522
They drain this twice a year
as a training exercise.

42:57.523 --> 42:59.284
The bag got caught in the grid.

42:59.285 --> 43:01.981
Yeah, but I bet they thought
this would never be found.

43:01.982 --> 43:03.523
Right.

43:04.282 --> 43:05.282
Laptop there.

43:19.523 --> 43:22.953
Hm. The laptop,
any chance of retrieving anything?

43:22.954 --> 43:26.202
Oh, well, a quick blow-dry
and Bob's your uncle.

43:26.203 --> 43:28.522
- Ah, shut up. I'm serious.
- Well, so am I.

43:28.523 --> 43:30.562
If it was switched off
when it went into the water,

43:30.563 --> 43:32.522
then we might get something.

43:32.523 --> 43:35.202
- Right.
- And this bag is pretty sturdy.

43:35.203 --> 43:36.222
Hm.

43:36.223 --> 43:38.523
And there's me thinking
designer gear's a rip-off.

43:41.069 --> 43:43.050
- Bag it.
- Right, Aiden...

43:49.043 --> 43:52.522
This is en route for the boyfriend,
isn't it?

43:52.523 --> 43:55.522
That cab to Yarm,
you'd come right past this.

43:55.523 --> 43:57.522
Yeah, this is his route into work.

43:57.523 --> 43:58.523
Aye.

43:58.524 --> 44:01.522
He suspects her of cheating,

44:01.523 --> 44:04.522
stole the laptop before the party,

44:04.523 --> 44:07.737
confronts her with it
and somehow kills her

44:07.738 --> 44:09.523
and then dumps it here.

44:14.312 --> 44:16.410
Why would I go to the Tees Barrage?

44:16.411 --> 44:19.312
Oh, just one line of questioning.

44:19.337 --> 44:21.337
It concerns her laptop.

44:21.864 --> 44:23.076
Is this a DNA thing?

44:23.529 --> 44:25.689
My DNA will be on her laptop definitely.

44:25.714 --> 44:28.714
No, it's not about DNA, love.

44:30.737 --> 44:33.736
Did you ever bully Danielle?

44:33.737 --> 44:35.032
- No.
- Are you sure about that?

44:35.033 --> 44:38.096
- Are you saying I did?
- Do you know who did bully her?

44:38.097 --> 44:40.736
Why you are we even talking about
bullying? Nobody bullied her!

44:40.737 --> 44:42.168
Is it her family saying this?

44:42.169 --> 44:44.736
Oh, it's just we have a witness
who said she felt bullied...

44:44.737 --> 44:46.160
- No way!
- ..by someone.

44:46.161 --> 44:48.102
Dani wasn't a doormat.

44:48.103 --> 44:50.736
She stood up to people.
You're looking at the wrong guy.

44:50.737 --> 44:51.716
Am I?

44:52.577 --> 44:53.737
Look...

44:54.536 --> 44:56.536
I'm not saying
we were going to last for ever.

44:56.561 --> 44:57.940
But I loved her.

44:57.965 --> 44:59.965
And I didn't push her off a boat.

45:02.996 --> 45:03.996
Ma'am...

45:04.623 --> 45:07.623
Oh, don't tell me.
None of his DNA on the body.

45:07.648 --> 45:09.191
Well, some of his DNA on the body.

45:09.216 --> 45:11.673
But not as much on the body
as of other people.

45:11.698 --> 45:13.304
Some ID'd, some not.

45:13.329 --> 45:15.722
So, it wouldn't stand
up in a million years.

45:17.737 --> 45:18.737
Oh...

45:19.849 --> 45:22.916
Kenny, come through for me.
Give me his motive.

45:27.636 --> 45:29.676
What was Dani up to online?

45:29.701 --> 45:31.701
Oh, well, nothing to suggest an affair.

45:31.726 --> 45:34.556
Er, not password protected.

45:35.324 --> 45:37.684
No hidden e-mail account.
No private browser.

45:37.709 --> 45:39.349
So, we've got nothing.

45:39.374 --> 45:40.414
Hm.

45:40.777 --> 45:44.736
Other than the fact his cab was sort
of near where the bag was found.

45:44.737 --> 45:45.737
Not quite.

45:46.583 --> 45:49.583
You know you asked us to look into
what she was up to money-wise?

45:49.608 --> 45:50.648
Yeah, what?

45:50.673 --> 45:53.633
Well, she was researching a firm
called Holt & Reid

45:53.737 --> 45:55.736
for life insurance.

45:55.737 --> 45:58.256
Which struck me as odd.

45:58.257 --> 45:59.483
Well, it could just be being sensible.

45:59.508 --> 46:01.081
No, wait a minute.

46:01.106 --> 46:02.736
Wait a minute.

46:02.737 --> 46:06.256
Now, she wasn't the type, was she,
according to Sadie?

46:06.257 --> 46:07.736
I mean, she had no dependents.

46:07.737 --> 46:10.737
She was living rent-free
in her sister's flat.

46:11.030 --> 46:12.856
No, I think Kenny's right.

46:12.857 --> 46:14.855
I think that sounds dodgy.

46:14.856 --> 46:15.790
Jac?

46:15.791 --> 46:18.741
'Ma'am, we've got a witness from
the barbecue who says she saw Dani.'

46:18.742 --> 46:20.281
- At Alanburn?
- 'Yes.

46:20.282 --> 46:23.361
- 'A waitress.'
- Well done, pet.

46:23.361 --> 46:25.361
She's found a waitress who remembers her.

46:27.361 --> 46:28.720
It's just through here.

46:28.721 --> 46:31.360
I'm really sorry
I didn't come forward yesterday.

46:31.361 --> 46:32.731
No, love. That's not unusual.

46:32.732 --> 46:35.360
People don't always put
two and two together.

46:35.361 --> 46:37.476
Actually, it's more that I...

46:38.881 --> 46:41.287
...didn't want to bad-mouth someone
who'd just been...

46:41.312 --> 46:42.396
Hm.

46:43.401 --> 46:45.360
Was she murdered?

46:45.361 --> 46:48.360
Everyone's saying that,
but I heard it was an accident.

46:48.361 --> 46:50.880
Ah, no, she was murdered, love.

46:50.881 --> 46:52.361
Oh...

46:53.361 --> 46:57.360
So, what was your interaction?

46:57.361 --> 46:58.881
I had a run-in with her.

47:00.041 --> 47:03.360
Probably about an hour
before she was found.

47:03.361 --> 47:05.360
What kind of run-in?

47:05.361 --> 47:08.038
Er, I shouted at her and, erm...

47:08.039 --> 47:09.563
...I swore at her.

47:10.149 --> 47:11.547
Right.

47:12.342 --> 47:15.360
So, er, what were the circumstances?

47:15.361 --> 47:18.361
I thought she was trying to get me
to shut up.

47:19.361 --> 47:20.361
Why?

47:20.876 --> 47:23.360
I was doing the champagne at the barbecue

47:23.361 --> 47:25.516
and some guy put his hands
on my backside.

47:26.620 --> 47:28.972
He was drunk, but I wasn't happy.

47:28.973 --> 47:31.360
Well, technically,
that is a sexual assault.

47:31.361 --> 47:32.591
I know!

47:32.592 --> 47:34.865
- It really hacked me off.
- Aye, it would.

47:34.866 --> 47:36.532
Obviously, it happens sometimes.

47:36.533 --> 47:40.396
But this guy was just
laughing it off and I saw red.

47:41.361 --> 47:45.360
Anyway, I wanted him chucked out
and she...

47:45.361 --> 47:47.880
- Her name's Danielle, right?
- That's right.

47:47.881 --> 47:50.360
Danielle tried to smooth things over.

47:50.361 --> 47:54.361
Offered me a cab home,
said she'd make up the wages.

47:54.900 --> 47:57.360
And you thought
she was trying to shut you up.

47:57.361 --> 47:58.361
Yes.

47:58.362 --> 48:03.361
The way they spoke about it
made me think I wasn't the first.

48:05.361 --> 48:08.876
Right. So, you think she knew this fella.

48:10.361 --> 48:12.360
Can you give us a description?

48:12.361 --> 48:13.361
Yeah, of course.

48:14.221 --> 48:16.596
Or I could just show you him.

48:23.188 --> 48:24.548
This guy.

48:31.361 --> 48:33.360
- He's got no previous convictions?
- No.

48:33.361 --> 48:34.905
And there's no intelligence.

48:34.906 --> 48:37.769
We also checked the Sex Offenders'
Register. Nothing.

48:37.770 --> 48:40.360
Yeah, and Clare's Law enquiries.
But there's only really work stuff.

48:40.361 --> 48:42.400
He runs the training side
of the business.

48:42.401 --> 48:45.360
Him and Dani did it together.
Instilling brand values.

48:45.361 --> 48:46.361
Brand values?

48:46.362 --> 48:49.360
Don't mention that upstairs,
they'll want us to get some.

48:49.361 --> 48:51.880
Well, just arrest him
on suspicion of sexual assault

48:51.881 --> 48:53.360
and bring it round to the murder.

48:53.361 --> 48:55.360
Ah, well, if I'm going
to confront him, Kenny,

48:55.361 --> 48:56.560
I'll want him unprepared.

48:56.561 --> 48:58.360
The way things are, he'll get wind of it.

48:58.361 --> 49:00.360
They're talking to each other online.

49:00.361 --> 49:02.236
The perils of social media, huh?

49:02.721 --> 49:05.560
Is there anyone on the inside
we could approach?

49:05.561 --> 49:07.361
There's Megan at Varsey's.

49:16.361 --> 49:18.361
- Can I get you a glass of champagne?
- Yeah, OK.

49:22.361 --> 49:23.576
I wondered when it would be my turn.

49:23.601 --> 49:24.888
Oh, it's just a chat.

49:24.889 --> 49:26.361
It's just a background, love.

49:27.361 --> 49:28.361
Shall we...?

49:32.947 --> 49:34.267
I find him disgusting.

49:34.292 --> 49:36.876
But, hand on heart,
some people find him funny.

49:37.401 --> 49:40.360
So, are you saying sexual assault
is routine?

49:40.361 --> 49:42.360
See, I wouldn't call them assaults.

49:42.361 --> 49:44.360
It's just part and parcel
of working here.

49:44.361 --> 49:46.360
If you want your NVQ, you just put up.

49:46.361 --> 49:48.674
I mean, let's face it,
he only does the training

49:48.675 --> 49:50.360
to hang around
with a load of 19-year-olds.

49:50.361 --> 49:52.361
Was Danielle aware of this?

49:52.836 --> 49:54.115
I don't know.

49:54.116 --> 49:56.361
She was big on the family
showing a united front, but...

49:57.268 --> 49:59.308
...she did stick up for us
behind closed doors, as a rule.

49:59.333 --> 50:02.073
- But not on this.
- No.

50:02.098 --> 50:05.518
But persistent harassment
wasn't something that was discussed?

50:06.355 --> 50:07.360
Like I say...

50:07.361 --> 50:09.361
...a lot of people think Ross is funny.

50:10.281 --> 50:11.556
I don't know.

50:12.201 --> 50:14.360
Maybe they paid some people off.

50:14.361 --> 50:16.775
They're not shy of bunging the brown
envelopes at the end of the week.

50:16.776 --> 50:18.720
So, cash was being handed out?

50:18.721 --> 50:20.881
Was it to silence complaints?

50:21.116 --> 50:22.360
Maybe.

50:22.361 --> 50:24.361
But then again, it could be nothing.

50:24.615 --> 50:26.975
They're always flinging perks
at their favourites.

50:27.608 --> 50:29.516
Usually the youngest and dumbest.

50:30.401 --> 50:32.156
It's just how it works.

50:32.721 --> 50:34.360
I want to defend myself.

50:34.361 --> 50:37.200
I still suggest you choose "no comment".

50:37.201 --> 50:40.033
- But they're intimating all sorts.
- Maybe we take a break.

50:40.034 --> 50:41.360
No! No breaks.

50:41.361 --> 50:43.400
I won't be marked down as a pervert.

50:43.401 --> 50:47.360
So, you're denying the allegation
of sexual assault on Marina Dinuk?

50:47.361 --> 50:48.428
Who?

50:48.429 --> 50:51.360
The waitress serving champagne
at the barbecue.

50:51.361 --> 50:53.200
Of course I deny it.

50:53.201 --> 50:54.361
OK, so, let's move on.

50:55.361 --> 50:57.360
Now, we've a witness who alleges

50:57.361 --> 51:01.033
you persistently sexually harass
junior members of staff

51:01.034 --> 51:03.360
at Varsey's Health And Beauty business.

51:03.361 --> 51:05.360
No. Never.

51:05.361 --> 51:06.494
I have a laugh with people.

51:06.495 --> 51:08.360
I've never harassed anyone.

51:08.361 --> 51:11.360
Are you denying you've sexually
touched a number of women?

51:11.361 --> 51:12.881
I may have...

51:13.316 --> 51:15.865
I might have touched them.
It's not sexual.

51:15.866 --> 51:17.360
It's... jokey.

51:17.361 --> 51:20.201
Ah, do they feel that way?

51:21.866 --> 51:24.360
Yes, OK, right. A few have not liked it.

51:24.361 --> 51:25.688
I understand that.

51:25.689 --> 51:28.360
Ah, and are these the ones
who've been paid off?

51:28.361 --> 51:30.361
No. It's just never come to that.

51:31.361 --> 51:34.360
Look, I know I'm a fool
and I should have known better.

51:34.361 --> 51:35.561
Mm.

51:36.721 --> 51:38.361
It's just a bit of fun, really.

51:39.361 --> 51:42.360
You don't understand.
Lisa's a high-profile woman.

51:42.361 --> 51:45.360
She's very busy.
She doesn't have much downtime.

51:45.361 --> 51:47.556
Oh, what, so you feel neglected?

51:48.114 --> 51:50.114
So that justifies it.

51:50.361 --> 51:52.361
Well, now, I think I've heard everything.

51:53.208 --> 51:55.742
So, let's get back to Marina Dinuk.

51:55.767 --> 51:57.233
The waitress?

51:57.258 --> 51:58.258
Ah, the very one.

51:58.361 --> 52:01.360
Now, did you and Dani fall out
at the party over your behaviour?

52:01.361 --> 52:04.099
We didn't fall out.
She gave me a talking-to.

52:04.100 --> 52:07.765
Oh, so why did you conceal this
talking-to when we first spoke?

52:07.766 --> 52:09.360
I would have thought that was obvious.

52:09.361 --> 52:12.150
This talking-to, did it result
in a physical encounter or a fight?

52:12.151 --> 52:13.361
No!

52:14.361 --> 52:16.361
No, I wouldn't lay a finger on Dani.

52:17.361 --> 52:19.360
I risked my life to try and save her.

52:19.361 --> 52:20.721
I did CPR.

52:21.196 --> 52:22.360
Mm.

52:22.361 --> 52:26.996
Is that why your DNA
is on these areas of her body?

52:29.361 --> 52:30.880
Obviously, yeah.

52:30.881 --> 52:32.041
Obviously, it is.

52:32.861 --> 52:34.636
It's not obvious to me, pet.

52:35.401 --> 52:37.996
It's not obvious at all.

52:53.441 --> 52:55.441
Are you looking for me?

52:56.841 --> 52:58.250
I'm with the trustees.

52:58.441 --> 53:01.441
Are you not aware your husband's
been taken into custody?

53:01.890 --> 53:03.441
What?

53:04.481 --> 53:06.570
Why did nobody call me?

53:08.327 --> 53:10.065
Are you going to release her body?

53:10.090 --> 53:12.872
They think it might be another week,
but I'll go and check.

53:15.801 --> 53:18.759
You'll have to forgive me, it's
the only way I'm getting through.

53:18.760 --> 53:21.441
- Would you...?
- Oh, not on duty, pet.

53:26.441 --> 53:30.441
So, you're aware of these rumours
about your husband's behaviour?

53:30.850 --> 53:32.440
Of course.

53:32.441 --> 53:34.440
What do you make of them?

53:34.441 --> 53:37.441
I assumed it was people
trying to get money off us.

53:38.481 --> 53:40.441
We have more than others.

53:41.134 --> 53:42.850
People want their slice.

53:43.481 --> 53:46.440
Turnover increases,
spitefulness increases.

53:46.441 --> 53:49.440
So, you think there's no truth to it.

53:49.441 --> 53:50.441
No.

53:51.441 --> 53:53.440
It's complete and utter rubbish.

53:53.441 --> 53:56.440
Were you aware
of the allegation on the night?

53:56.441 --> 53:57.441
No.

53:57.442 --> 54:00.440
No, it doesn't surprise me
it's coming out now.

54:00.441 --> 54:01.906
Why not?

54:01.907 --> 54:04.441
People try it on when you're vulnerable.

54:04.690 --> 54:07.441
Normally, it's water
off a duck's back, but...

54:08.441 --> 54:09.441
...with Dani...

54:10.090 --> 54:12.441
I don't think I can take much more.

54:18.441 --> 54:20.440
Look, is there anything more
you can tell us

54:20.441 --> 54:23.440
about this set-to
between Dani and your husband?

54:23.441 --> 54:25.440
Anything at all?

54:25.441 --> 54:27.010
If there was anything...

54:27.961 --> 54:29.440
...anything, I'd tell you.

54:29.441 --> 54:31.441
Only, we've a witness...

54:32.027 --> 54:36.170
...who said Dani was concerned
recently about a family issue.

54:37.294 --> 54:39.974
And we think it's about
your husband's behaviour.

54:40.121 --> 54:42.440
He concealed the argument with Dani.

54:42.441 --> 54:44.441
He didn't conceal it.

54:45.174 --> 54:47.530
He didn't want to upset anyone
by bringing it up.

54:49.441 --> 54:51.961
Ross loved Dani.

54:52.407 --> 54:54.887
Now, why do you think
he jumped in after her?

54:55.721 --> 54:58.041
Were you aware
of your husband's movements

54:58.066 --> 54:59.589
for the duration of the party?

54:59.614 --> 55:01.574
Yeah. We were together.

55:03.441 --> 55:06.441
But you said you went looking
for Dani on your own.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.210
OK, maybe for a few minutes.

55:09.654 --> 55:12.334
If he pushed her off a boat,
I'd know about it.

55:13.121 --> 55:16.130
Believe me,
nothing he does escapes my notice.

55:23.074 --> 55:25.210
Burying her head in the sand.

55:27.208 --> 55:29.568
She sees it but doesn't see it.

55:29.801 --> 55:32.640
It could be a bluff.
Or she could be involved herself.

55:32.641 --> 55:34.441
Yeah, maybe. But...

55:35.327 --> 55:37.308
...somehow, I don't think so.

55:39.134 --> 55:41.134
I'll never cease to be amazed

55:41.159 --> 55:43.490
at the lengths some women go to
to protect their men. Huh!

55:44.441 --> 55:47.153
If I say maternal instinct,
are you going to hit me?

55:47.154 --> 55:48.961
No. You could well be right.

55:49.721 --> 55:52.201
There's got to be
some explanation for it.

55:52.226 --> 55:54.226
Other than being completely stupid.

55:55.287 --> 55:56.287
And she's not that.

56:00.441 --> 56:02.890
Oh, ma'am. You need to call Jac.

56:03.801 --> 56:05.810
And, er, this was going cold
on your desk.

56:06.454 --> 56:08.570
Oh, Kenny, you're a life-saver.

56:10.201 --> 56:12.490
- No corporate hospitality, then?
- No, I'm afraid not.

56:18.441 --> 56:21.089
- 'Jac, you wanted me?'
- Yeah.

56:21.090 --> 56:24.042
I don't think it was her online
activity that was significant.

56:24.043 --> 56:25.994
It was what was on her hard drive.

56:25.995 --> 56:27.440
'So, what's on it?'

56:27.441 --> 56:29.440
It looks like she was keeping
some kind of record

56:29.441 --> 56:31.440
on payments to female employees.

56:31.441 --> 56:34.440
'Yeah? How many? Can you have a look?'

56:34.441 --> 56:37.441
Er, can you go to the next page, please?

56:39.087 --> 56:41.358
OK, so, here's what Dani does.

56:41.441 --> 56:45.120
She does all her research
behind closed doors

56:45.121 --> 56:46.774
and then presents it to Lisa.

56:46.775 --> 56:48.754
OK, so, the obvious one is...

56:48.755 --> 56:50.780
...Ross clocked
that she was gathering evidence

56:50.781 --> 56:53.640
- to expose him to his wife.
- That's possible, isn't it?

56:53.641 --> 56:56.440
It might explain why that laptop
ended up in the river.

56:56.441 --> 56:58.440
Now, let's go through this list of girls.

56:58.441 --> 57:01.206
Divvy it up
and let's start ringing round.

57:01.207 --> 57:04.440
I've not had much joy in making
contact with the employees.

57:04.441 --> 57:07.020
It's not clear that the details
are kept up to date.

57:07.021 --> 57:08.302
Well, we've got the addresses,

57:08.327 --> 57:09.440
- haven't we?
- Yeah.

57:09.441 --> 57:13.441
Oh, well, call me old-fashioned,
but can't we just turn up?

57:18.441 --> 57:20.640
We're looking for Amelia Garwood.

57:20.641 --> 57:22.641
She's just in there.

57:25.107 --> 57:27.416
Morning. This is DCI Stanhope.

57:27.441 --> 57:29.480
I'm DS Healy
from Northumberland And City Police.

57:29.481 --> 57:31.690
Can you confirm your name and postcode?

57:32.441 --> 57:35.440
Amelia Leone Garwood, NE17 4RG.

57:35.441 --> 57:37.018
Oh, you're definitely the right person.

57:37.019 --> 57:39.120
Not easy to track down.

57:39.121 --> 57:40.750
What's this about?

57:40.751 --> 57:44.480
Well, you will have read about
the lady we found dead on Quayside.

57:44.481 --> 57:47.033
What, the lass
who was pushed off the boat?

57:47.034 --> 57:48.440
Aye, that's the one.

57:48.441 --> 57:50.441
- Awful.
- Mm.

57:51.441 --> 57:53.153
I don't know anything about it.

57:53.154 --> 57:55.961
What, so no-one at Varsey's
is talking about it?

57:56.687 --> 57:58.330
I don't know anyone at Varsey's.

57:59.441 --> 58:01.586
- But did you not work there?
- No.

58:01.587 --> 58:04.440
I applied, but they never gave me a job.

58:04.441 --> 58:07.280
So, did you do the recruitment day?

58:07.281 --> 58:08.440
No.

58:08.441 --> 58:10.273
I just uploaded an application.

58:10.274 --> 58:12.059
I gave them
all my contacts and references,

58:12.060 --> 58:13.441
but I didn't even get an interview.

58:13.930 --> 58:15.960
Which, to be honest, really upset me,

58:15.961 --> 58:18.441
because the money and benefits
package looked amazing.

58:19.441 --> 58:21.890
She barely even gives me a dinner break.

58:23.481 --> 58:27.650
So, what was so amazing
about the benefits package, love?

58:30.220 --> 58:31.220
'Ma'am?'

58:31.245 --> 58:35.245
Kenny, that life insurance company
Dani checked out.

58:35.270 --> 58:37.270
Something and Reid, was it?

58:37.295 --> 58:39.295
- 'Holt & Reid, ma'am.'
- Aye, that's it.

58:39.320 --> 58:41.520
So, what's the address?
I want to pay them a visit.

58:41.545 --> 58:43.730
'It's Mangrove House in Cowgate.'

58:44.441 --> 58:45.850
You're kidding me!

58:46.441 --> 58:48.539
I thought they were a decorator's.

58:48.540 --> 58:50.079
No, that's 67.

58:50.080 --> 58:52.059
We're looking for 67A.

58:52.060 --> 58:53.440
The insurance company.

58:53.441 --> 58:55.440
Next one along, maybe?

58:55.441 --> 58:57.440
Insurers doesn't ring a bell.

58:57.441 --> 58:59.440
I'm pretty certain
there was only one tenant

58:59.441 --> 59:01.440
and they were in property clearances.

59:01.441 --> 59:03.053
When did they move out?

59:03.054 --> 59:04.440
Er...

59:04.441 --> 59:06.441
...a couple of weeks ago.

59:20.441 --> 59:22.977
Well, definitely used by someone.

59:22.978 --> 59:24.480
Yeah, a voice on the phone.

59:24.481 --> 59:26.480
Stop the post piling up.

59:26.481 --> 59:28.610
They left in a hurry.

59:30.274 --> 59:32.274
I'd say Holt & Reid Insurance

59:32.299 --> 59:35.299
is nothing more than a logo
and a website.

59:36.221 --> 59:38.490
And that's why Dani came looking.

59:51.081 --> 59:52.440
Now, don't be fooled by this.

59:52.441 --> 59:54.133
It's not a company.

59:54.134 --> 59:56.916
It's a set-up for moving money around.

59:56.917 --> 59:59.440
Now, the question is,
who set it up and why?

59:59.441 --> 01:00:02.440
Varsey's themselves have done it
to hide harassment payoffs.

01:00:02.441 --> 01:00:03.441
Yeah, well, maybe.

01:00:03.442 --> 01:00:06.440
But it's a pretty complicated way
to go about it, isn't it?

01:00:06.441 --> 01:00:09.440
Now, 24 hours before she died,

01:00:09.441 --> 01:00:12.440
Dani was in a bar
with her nearest and dearest

01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:14.440
and she touched upon manipulation.

01:00:14.441 --> 01:00:17.440
She didn't elaborate,
but maybe someone clocked it.

01:00:17.441 --> 01:00:18.548
Check it out.

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:21.120
And then she goes here.

01:00:21.121 --> 01:00:22.284
Hm?

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:23.440
Late at night.

01:00:23.441 --> 01:00:26.440
I reckon we should see more
employees, not the bigwigs.

01:00:26.441 --> 01:00:28.179
There's 200 of them.
They'd get wind of it.

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:31.440
Ah, well, if there are 200 employees, hm,

01:00:31.441 --> 01:00:33.440
why were there only 80 at that party?

01:00:33.441 --> 01:00:34.956
Well, maybe it was for the in-crowd.

01:00:34.957 --> 01:00:38.800
Or maybe there are only 80 employees.

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:41.640
Maybe the rest
are just names on a payroll.

01:00:41.641 --> 01:00:43.960
A fake company, fake employees.

01:00:43.961 --> 01:00:45.440
I mean, it makes sense.

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:47.086
A good way to cipher money.

01:00:47.087 --> 01:00:49.159
Pay people who don't exist
or won't ask questions.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.480
Aye, look at the lass in Babywear.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:55.440
They take her ID, then reel her in
with the promise of a job.

01:00:55.441 --> 01:00:57.254
And how many staff are there

01:00:57.255 --> 01:00:59.254
with life insurance
they barely understand?

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:01.939
No, you're right.
Young women on short contracts

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.934
won't necessarily know
that they're being used.

01:01:03.935 --> 01:01:06.254
Aye, target the youngest
and the most vulnerable.

01:01:06.255 --> 01:01:09.254
- A good way to cook your books.
- Exactly.

01:01:09.255 --> 01:01:13.255
So, what if this is not about
sexual harassment at all?

01:01:14.255 --> 01:01:17.570
What if it's about
good old-fashioned fraud?

01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:28.070
This is absolutely ridiculous.

01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:30.849
- There's no need.
- I'll take her to the car.

01:01:30.874 --> 01:01:32.874
This way, madam.

01:01:40.929 --> 01:01:42.929
Watch your head.

01:01:43.816 --> 01:01:46.084
First, my husband, and now me!

01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:57.070
Yeah.

01:01:57.817 --> 01:01:58.817
I do remember.

01:01:58.842 --> 01:02:01.324
- It's her.
- Really?

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:07.275
I've never been to their offices.
I've no idea.

01:02:07.276 --> 01:02:12.069
No, but you have authorised
quite a few payments to them.

01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:13.070
Look at this.

01:02:13.071 --> 01:02:15.808
I'm not the only one
who authorises payments.

01:02:15.809 --> 01:02:16.975
Hm.

01:02:16.976 --> 01:02:19.750
That night when you said Dani was upset.

01:02:20.565 --> 01:02:23.270
Was that because
she confronted you about a fraud?

01:02:23.884 --> 01:02:27.070
And don't tell me
it was about the booze running out.

01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:31.069
She was upset...

01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:34.069
...because Ross had got himself
in trouble with a waitress.

01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:36.069
Ah, now, I know
everyone's talking about that.

01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:38.070
But I don't think that's connected.

01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:42.069
I think they paid girls off
and they covered it up.

01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:44.759
And I don't think that's true, actually.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.069
Not any more.

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:47.813
I mean, if that was the cover-up,

01:02:47.814 --> 01:02:49.589
why do all these women,

01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:53.244
who've never even worked
at Varsey's, have a paper trail?

01:02:55.444 --> 01:02:58.478
Look, I know you're loyal, Paula.

01:02:58.479 --> 01:03:00.164
But a woman has died.

01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:03.069
You need to cooperate.

01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:05.269
Look, I don't want
to get anyone into trouble.

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:08.069
I mean, if this is something
Lisa was up to,

01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:10.070
I don't want anything to do with it.

01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:15.069
How much has she authorised
in the last seven days?

01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:17.752
There's a new starter
who had a cash bonus.

01:03:17.753 --> 01:03:21.069
Oh, right. Let's make her fake
employee of the month, shall we?

01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:24.258
Now, are there many more
like that lass from Babywear?

01:03:24.259 --> 01:03:27.069
Oh, yeah. There's quite a lot of names.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:29.275
All earning just under 12 grand.

01:03:29.276 --> 01:03:33.069
Oh, aye, keep them on zero hours.
Their tax, their problem.

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.069
Yeah, I reckon someone's
inflating invoices.

01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:36.568
I mean, look at this.

01:03:36.569 --> 01:03:37.788
Simon the decorator.

01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:41.069
A one-man band
repainted 15 shops in a week.

01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:44.069
Huh! I should get him to do my extension.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:47.069
Oh, prices like those, maybe not.

01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:51.069
Get Aiden to check out these
contractors, if they exist.

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:53.070
Is this a tax dodge...

01:03:53.424 --> 01:03:56.069
...or is someone creaming off
for themselves?

01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:57.476
Ma'am, where do you want Lisa?

01:03:57.477 --> 01:03:59.522
Er, put her in room one.

01:03:59.523 --> 01:04:00.824
Let her stew.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:03.069
Jac...

01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:05.069
Get yourself over to Paula's place.

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:06.070
Have a poke about.

01:04:06.071 --> 01:04:07.444
Right.

01:04:11.963 --> 01:04:13.963
I run a charity with your superintendent.

01:04:13.988 --> 01:04:16.508
I could ring him
and ask him why you're harassing me.

01:04:16.533 --> 01:04:18.013
Oh, right.

01:04:18.038 --> 01:04:20.676
Well, mention it's on suspicion
of false accounting,

01:04:20.708 --> 01:04:22.269
because he's got fraud targets.

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:23.952
You'll make him very happy.

01:04:23.953 --> 01:04:26.685
If there was anything
crooked, I'd know about it.

01:04:26.686 --> 01:04:30.909
So, are you aware of all monies
going into and out of your accounts?

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:32.070
Mm-hm.

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:36.069
Now, the refurbishment of Jesmond.

01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:38.069
- How much was that?
- 50,000.

01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:40.070
100.

01:04:40.484 --> 01:04:44.070
How much are you paying Megan Sibisi?

01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:48.404
I don't know.
She's a team leader, so I'd say...

01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:50.053
...23 grand.

01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:52.069
Try 46.

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:54.070
Into two different accounts.

01:04:57.070 --> 01:04:59.804
OK, so, I'm not on top of everything.

01:05:00.823 --> 01:05:02.503
I leave a lot of it to Paula.

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:04.069
I'd ask her.

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:07.069
Do you think she's on the fiddle?

01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:10.069
I thought maybe she was giving herself

01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:13.604
- the odd grand here and there.
- And, what, you ignored it?

01:05:14.796 --> 01:05:17.636
I've probably not rewarded her the
way I should have over the years.

01:05:19.070 --> 01:05:20.070
She was slogging her guts out,

01:05:20.071 --> 01:05:22.493
profits were going up. I felt like...

01:05:22.494 --> 01:05:24.244
...maybe she'd earned it.

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:07.069
Er, my DS spoke to this fella earlier.

01:06:07.070 --> 01:06:09.069
Do you recognise him?

01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:11.589
- No.
- No, well, that's hardly surprising.

01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:14.069
Apparently, you'd had a few.

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:17.070
He is the bouncer
at the Triptych Bar in the city.

01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:21.070
The night before Dani died,
he put you into a taxi.

01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:26.069
Right. Well, that was kind of him.

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:28.069
He said
you'd been sitting on the pavement

01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:31.069
bawling your eyes out with the deceased.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.583
Now, what was that all about?

01:06:33.584 --> 01:06:36.069
It was we'd been having
a lot of arguments

01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:38.486
about how to deal
with the Ross situation.

01:06:38.487 --> 01:06:40.070
Ah, I don't believe you.

01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:45.069
I think this Ross business is convenient.

01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:47.069
Well, tell that to the women
he's been harassing.

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:50.069
You are defrauding Varsey's.

01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:54.069
Covering inflated payments,
opening bank accounts,

01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:57.069
using names taken from people
looking for work.

01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:02.069
Well, that's an elaborate way
to reward yourself, Paula.

01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:04.070
But Dani had clocked onto it.

01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:07.069
How do I know that?

01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:08.429
Because...

01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:11.069
...she left you in that bar

01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:17.069
and she went to check out the fake
insurance company you'd set up.

01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:19.204
How much have you taken, Paula?

01:07:20.629 --> 01:07:22.724
What did Dani really find out?

01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:30.070
All right.

01:07:39.484 --> 01:07:41.069
Her bank accounts, ma'am.

01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:43.429
Oh, what is she, up to her knees in debt?

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:45.069
No, the thing is,

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:47.728
she's never been even overdrawn
on her current account.

01:07:47.729 --> 01:07:50.069
What about credit cards?
They can be a killer.

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:52.630
Nope. Jac reckons
there's nothing in her home

01:07:52.631 --> 01:07:54.069
to suggest spending sprees,

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:57.069
luxury holidays or unexplained gifts.

01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:59.726
What, she's not even making
a profit on it?

01:07:59.727 --> 01:08:03.069
Well, what there is
is charges on some transactions.

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:05.069
I thought it might have been
foreign currency.

01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:07.069
But I looked into it.

01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:08.070
It's encrypted.

01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:10.190
Encrypted?

01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:17.069
Well, we thought this
was a sophisticated fraud, Kenny.

01:08:17.069 --> 01:08:19.269
But that's another level, isn't it?

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:22.461
So, I've done a bit of digging.
All these companies are registered

01:08:22.462 --> 01:08:24.069
at the same shell
in the British Virgin Islands.

01:08:24.069 --> 01:08:27.069
Oh, so there's no other trace,
bar paperwork.

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:28.069
No.

01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:31.069
All services, nothing physical.

01:08:31.069 --> 01:08:33.069
Oh...!

01:08:38.069 --> 01:08:40.069
I've got it.

01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:44.069
Paula's acting as a middleman...

01:08:44.836 --> 01:08:46.804
...for money laundering.

01:08:48.069 --> 01:08:50.069
No wonder the turnover went up.

01:08:51.069 --> 01:08:54.787
Someone must be putting money
into Varsey's, hm?

01:08:54.788 --> 01:08:57.444
And she's having to justify the cash...

01:08:58.069 --> 01:09:01.069
- ...and then creating fake spending.
- So, you were right.

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:03.269
Organised criminals
get their fingers in everywhere.

01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:05.069
Aye, don't they just!

01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:08.270
I got into debt.

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:14.069
So, I moved money into my account
to cover the shortfall.

01:09:14.876 --> 01:09:16.243
And then, to cover that...

01:09:17.296 --> 01:09:19.656
...I started moving work funds
and it just...

01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:22.069
...sort of snowballed.

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:24.644
Yeah, well,
that's all very touching, love.

01:09:25.069 --> 01:09:29.069
But, you see, I know it's not you
lining your own pockets.

01:09:30.063 --> 01:09:32.863
See, I think you're doing
all the donkey work,

01:09:32.888 --> 01:09:35.888
you know, like you do for Lisa,
only for someone else.

01:09:37.069 --> 01:09:40.069
Now, who is the link, love, between you,

01:09:40.069 --> 01:09:43.069
a professional woman,
who works hard for a living,

01:09:43.069 --> 01:09:44.609
and them?

01:09:44.611 --> 01:09:49.069
Those people with dirty money
from God knows what.

01:09:49.069 --> 01:09:51.069
Now, who is it?

01:09:53.069 --> 01:09:55.070
- Not now!
- Ma'am...

01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:03.069
There were some wineglasses at Paula's.

01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:06.444
They came up with a fingerprint
match to another crime scene.

01:10:29.407 --> 01:10:30.902
Mr Desai?

01:10:30.927 --> 01:10:31.927
Yeah.

01:10:32.407 --> 01:10:35.704
- Oh, I'm DCI Vera...
- Oh, you're detectives.

01:10:35.705 --> 01:10:37.406
Aye, yes. We're investigating...

01:10:37.407 --> 01:10:39.406
Well, have you got him?
Have you traced the fella?

01:10:39.407 --> 01:10:41.621
Er, not yet.

01:10:42.407 --> 01:10:45.821
But there has been a development
in your father's case.

01:10:47.407 --> 01:10:49.406
He was found here.

01:10:49.407 --> 01:10:51.406
Head injuries, bruising.

01:10:51.407 --> 01:10:53.087
Splinters from the banister.

01:10:54.173 --> 01:10:56.742
They couldn't be sure,
but they said maybe he tripped

01:10:56.767 --> 01:10:58.301
and then he had the heart attack.

01:10:58.767 --> 01:11:01.406
Though, they couldn't rule out
a confrontation

01:11:01.407 --> 01:11:03.581
and that he was pushed.

01:11:04.407 --> 01:11:07.407
Well, I'm sorry
it's not been resolved, love.

01:11:08.407 --> 01:11:09.766
Erm...

01:11:09.767 --> 01:11:11.406
Look, I know everyone
was doing their best,

01:11:11.407 --> 01:11:13.407
but to have no answers after this long...

01:11:15.407 --> 01:11:17.406
Just left for dead, though.

01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:19.000
That's pretty cruel.

01:11:19.001 --> 01:11:21.406
You know, they've got a fingerprint
of the guy. A good one.

01:11:21.407 --> 01:11:23.406
- A big thumb.
- Yeah, well...

01:11:23.407 --> 01:11:24.920
It just doesn't match anyone
on the database.

01:11:24.921 --> 01:11:27.026
Look, I can't get your hopes up, love.

01:11:27.027 --> 01:11:32.406
But I will say that strong evidence
often gets results.

01:11:32.407 --> 01:11:34.086
He'll slip up.

01:11:34.087 --> 01:11:35.406
That's what we're hoping for.

01:11:35.407 --> 01:11:39.407
Have you got any sense
of why your dad was attacked?

01:11:42.407 --> 01:11:44.407
I've thought about it a lot. I mean...

01:11:45.407 --> 01:11:48.171
...it could be just obviously
some random burglary.

01:11:48.172 --> 01:11:50.407
Mm. But...?

01:11:53.407 --> 01:11:56.701
I think Dad must have had
some kind of gambling problem.

01:11:58.247 --> 01:11:59.766
So, why do you think that?

01:11:59.767 --> 01:12:03.407
Well, I'd not got a sniff of it
and nor had anyone else, but...

01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:06.406
...after he died, it became obvious

01:12:06.407 --> 01:12:09.407
that his finances
were all over the place.

01:12:10.407 --> 01:12:11.407
Right.

01:12:11.408 --> 01:12:14.406
I think he must have dipped
into the restaurant.

01:12:14.407 --> 01:12:18.407
You know, borrow back to cover losses.

01:12:20.407 --> 01:12:21.407
Thank you.

01:12:22.767 --> 01:12:23.927
Right.

01:12:26.407 --> 01:12:28.059
Well, according to the books,

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.406
turnover went up rapidly,
cash injections,

01:12:30.407 --> 01:12:32.926
and then a sudden drop-off.

01:12:32.927 --> 01:12:34.766
So, he was putting money through,
then what?

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:38.406
Yeah, well, maybe Dad got cold feet.
Messed up somehow.

01:12:38.407 --> 01:12:41.406
Maybe he threatened to blow
the whistle. I don't know.

01:12:41.407 --> 01:12:43.407
But this was payback.

01:12:46.767 --> 01:12:48.406
Himesh Desai.

01:12:48.407 --> 01:12:50.766
Found dead a year ago.

01:12:50.767 --> 01:12:52.407
Have you come across him at all?

01:12:55.181 --> 01:12:56.406
No?

01:12:56.407 --> 01:12:59.926
Well, whoever was with him
at the time of his death

01:12:59.927 --> 01:13:02.447
was in your home
within the last few days.

01:13:05.407 --> 01:13:06.407
I don't believe you.

01:13:06.407 --> 01:13:07.407
No?

01:13:07.408 --> 01:13:11.406
Well, I can show you fingerprint
evidence, if that'll help.

01:13:11.407 --> 01:13:12.701
Now, who was it?

01:13:14.799 --> 01:13:17.119
Who came round to yours?

01:13:17.821 --> 01:13:19.406
Hm?

01:13:19.407 --> 01:13:20.837
Look...

01:13:20.838 --> 01:13:23.406
...one of your oldest friends...

01:13:23.407 --> 01:13:24.606
...is dead.

01:13:24.607 --> 01:13:26.407
Yes! I know!

01:13:27.407 --> 01:13:28.564
But I...

01:13:28.565 --> 01:13:31.034
...I genuinely, hand on heart,

01:13:31.035 --> 01:13:33.406
have no idea how that happened.

01:13:33.407 --> 01:13:36.101
Look, I'm not going
to charge you with murder...

01:13:36.767 --> 01:13:39.406
...if you tell me who came round.

01:13:39.407 --> 01:13:41.407
I mean, that's enough.

01:13:42.407 --> 01:13:44.581
Because, if you don't tell me, pet...

01:13:45.593 --> 01:13:47.593
...and you leave here...

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.981
Well, I think he came for Mr Desai.

01:13:51.893 --> 01:13:54.213
He came for Dani.

01:13:54.238 --> 01:13:57.238
Now, what's to say
he's not gonna come for you?

01:14:09.326 --> 01:14:12.326
We need to have a serious talk
about Paula, love.

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:14.699
Mm.

01:14:14.724 --> 01:14:18.187
Apart from your sisters,
who else did she have in her life?

01:14:18.326 --> 01:14:19.834
No-one.

01:14:19.835 --> 01:14:21.570
There's us and work.

01:14:21.571 --> 01:14:23.890
- What, no relationships?
- None.

01:14:23.891 --> 01:14:25.325
Famously single.

01:14:25.326 --> 01:14:27.325
It was a bit of a running joke,
if I'm honest.

01:14:27.326 --> 01:14:30.846
Was she resentful of this mickey-taking?

01:14:31.172 --> 01:14:32.652
Maybe.

01:14:32.986 --> 01:14:33.986
Maybe it was her anyway.

01:14:35.115 --> 01:14:37.513
I mean, I knew she envied Lisa.

01:14:37.733 --> 01:14:38.733
But who doesn't?

01:14:39.853 --> 01:14:41.853
And I knew something had changed, but...

01:14:42.326 --> 01:14:45.325
...I didn't think she was doing
anything dodgy. Not at all.

01:14:45.326 --> 01:14:48.006
Now, you said she'd changed. How?

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:51.767
Erm, she tried to sort of...

01:14:52.326 --> 01:14:54.325
...assert herself a bit more.

01:14:54.326 --> 01:14:56.326
But she went about it in the wrong way.

01:14:56.706 --> 01:14:59.087
Like, a classic example.

01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:03.139
She made up some fella she met
at an investment seminar.

01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:07.139
Some loaded Romeo
helping her "manage her portfolio".

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.139
Well, why would that be a lie?

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:11.140
Because it was too good to be true.

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:16.139
To be fair, Dani said we should
give her the benefit of the doubt.

01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:18.139
But she took it too far.

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:22.139
Like, made out
he was some George Clooney type.

01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:25.701
Treated her like a princess,
house in Greece, the works.

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.581
But he never turned up to anything
we invited him to.

01:15:31.941 --> 01:15:33.140
Aiden...

01:15:33.893 --> 01:15:34.893
Thanks, love.

01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:38.140
Give us your phone.

01:15:38.141 --> 01:15:40.140
- What?
- I'm out of juice.

01:15:40.678 --> 01:15:42.140
I want to check something.

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.139
What are you looking for?

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.140
The sequence of events.

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:51.500
Here you are. Yeah.

01:15:53.613 --> 01:15:55.653
Yeah, sequence of events, hm?

01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:59.139
Dani gets on the boat, hm?

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.659
Party, party, party.

01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.139
And they run out of booze.

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:04.139
Now, what does Dani do next?

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:07.819
Asks Kirsty who manages the boat.

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:10.140
Now, what if that
is not about a complaint?

01:16:10.461 --> 01:16:14.140
What if that's her making the final
connection to the money laundering?

01:16:14.581 --> 01:16:16.139
Hm?

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:19.140
Look, who links both sides
of the investigation?

01:16:19.581 --> 01:16:22.139
The moneyman
with a shedload of businesses

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:26.139
who's had a load of business
put his way from Varsey's.

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.139
He should be sunning himself in the Med.

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:29.799
- Richard?!
- Aye!

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.140
The boat owner!

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:40.139
Right, check the back of the house.

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:41.341
Come round the front.

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:49.819
Anything?

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:51.139
No, no sign of anything yet.

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:54.261
- Looking for your neighbour.
- He's just got in a cab.

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:57.139
- What's this about?
- He's just got into a taxi.

01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:58.819
Shit...!

01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:00.593
- Right, you deal with it.
- I've got it.

01:17:00.594 --> 01:17:02.140
Do you know the company, mate?

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:14.139
We know he has a holiday home.

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:16.708
Where in Greece is it?

01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:19.140
- I don't know.
- I don't believe you.

01:17:19.661 --> 01:17:21.139
But he didn't do anything.

01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:23.877
Well, then,
he will be able to explain himself.

01:17:23.878 --> 01:17:26.221
Where in Greece is it?

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:46.499
Now, identify these calls you made
on the night she died.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.139
Now, who's saying what to who?

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.514
Come on, Paula.

01:17:50.515 --> 01:17:53.140
Where in Greece is it?

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:03.980
Yeah, I'm at the terminal now.

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:07.820
17:45, Thessaloniki.

01:18:08.306 --> 01:18:09.626
I've got you.

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.140
Police! Watch your backs!

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:24.659
'Last call for flight BA155
to Thessaloniki.

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:27.139
'Can passengers please proceed
to gate five?

01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:28.562
'The last call for flight...'

01:18:28.563 --> 01:18:31.179
He called me to say
he'd smooth things over with her.

01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:34.614
And he was as shocked as I was
at what had happened.

01:18:34.639 --> 01:18:36.139
And you fell for that?

01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:40.179
I mean, how can an intelligent woman
like you fall for that claptrap?

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.659
It's not claptrap!

01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:44.550
- Cos I just trust him.
- Oh...!

01:18:44.551 --> 01:18:48.140
He's made me twice the person
I was before I met him.

01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:51.140
He loves me.

01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:59.341
He made you a party to a crime.

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:03.140
I agreed with the crime.

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.140
I was just getting what I deserved,
for once.

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:10.139
And did Dani get what she deserved?

01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:13.139
No! But he didn't push her off that boat.

01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:15.139
Ah, you're right about that.

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:17.819
He strangled her first
and then dropped her into the water.

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:21.139
He wasn't even there at the time
it happened! He'd gone home!

01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:23.139
Oh, so when do you think it happened?

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:25.823
Midnight. Around midnight.

01:19:25.824 --> 01:19:27.139
Wrong.

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:29.139
But her body was at Quayside.

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:32.140
Aye, cos she got caught under the boat.

01:19:33.541 --> 01:19:35.139
How do you mean?

01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:38.139
I mean, she got caught under the boat

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.139
after he killed her at that hotel.

01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:46.139
I mean, that was bad luck for him,
but it was worse luck to Danielle!

01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:56.139
Are you going to answer that?

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:16.139
- It's occupied.
- Oh, that's all right.

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:18.140
I'll wait.

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:05.821
Well, we've nothing on you,
have we, Richard?

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:09.979
Well, I don't have criminal convictions,

01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:11.139
if that's what you mean.

01:21:12.141 --> 01:21:13.340
Hm.

01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:17.821
It must be useful
in your line of work, no record.

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:21.659
It must be very useful
to your associates.

01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:23.817
No, I don't... I don't have associates.

01:21:23.818 --> 01:21:25.139
I work on my own.

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:28.819
Ah, right, you're the fella
who takes opportunities, aren't you?

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:32.139
Well, we know quite a lot
about those opportunities.

01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:36.499
About how you've been laundering
money through local businesses.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.140
Varsey's included.

01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:42.139
How you've charmed your girlfriend
into being an accomplice.

01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:44.139
And all this...

01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.139
...hidden away offshore.

01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:48.139
It's ridiculous.

01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:50.139
I thought I was here for a murder case.

01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:51.755
Oh, sorry, yes.

01:21:51.756 --> 01:21:55.659
Er... and we've evidence
linking you to that as well.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:22:01.181
Now, this is a record of your mobile
pinging masts on Grey Street...

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:04.381
...and Alanburn Manor on Saturday night.

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:06.500
So?

01:22:06.741 --> 01:22:08.139
I was out and about.

01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:10.654
Ain't that the truth.
Because both of these places

01:22:10.655 --> 01:22:14.139
are connected to the victim
on the night of her death.

01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:18.139
Which strongly suggests you were
in the vicinity of her burgled flat

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:21.140
and then in the vicinity
of where she was killed.

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.339
Well, suggests...

01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:25.621
...it doesn't mean proof, does it?

01:22:25.622 --> 01:22:29.139
Oh, it also pinged a mast on Teesside

01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:32.139
where her bag was found.

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:35.139
Hey, you really went round the houses

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:37.139
to cover your tracks,
didn't you, Richard?

01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:39.139
This is all circumstantial.

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:40.659
- You know it is.
- Yeah, true.

01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:43.979
But it does build a picture, hm?

01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.421
And it's enough for us
to ask the question...

01:22:46.939 --> 01:22:49.939
...why did you strangle Danielle Varsey?

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:52.139
I didn't know her, so...

01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:53.819
...why would I kill her?

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:57.712
Well, one reason might be
because she clocked onto your scam.

01:22:57.713 --> 01:23:00.501
See, all this
is what she's uncovered about you.

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:02.789
Now, what I don't get is this.

01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:06.139
I mean, even if she had exposed
your fraud...

01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:08.852
I mean, a fella like you,

01:23:08.853 --> 01:23:11.139
good grief,
you would've danced around that

01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:14.139
and you'd have got, what,
three years, tops.

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:16.719
Right, so now you're actually admitting

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.492
that I don't have a motive.

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:19.701
Nah.

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:21.461
I'm saying...

01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:24.140
...this is your motive.

01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:28.499
You knew that any contact with us

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:35.139
would flag up the unexplained death
of restauranteur Himesh Desai,

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:38.139
identifying you as the mystery person

01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:40.139
present at the time of his death.

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.820
Did you know there was a dirty,
great fingerprint left at the scene?

01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:46.140
Hm?

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:49.139
See, you're not as clever
as you think you are.

01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:53.799
So, you could risk Danielle
exposing the fraud,

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:59.140
but you couldn't risk being
connected to Mr Desai's murder.

01:23:59.682 --> 01:24:00.682
Hm?

01:24:00.707 --> 01:24:02.907
So, just to be on the safe side...

01:24:03.939 --> 01:24:08.619
...you took one of your opportunities
and decided to silence her for good.

01:24:08.644 --> 01:24:09.964
Wow...

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:13.477
- You are clutching at straws.
- Am I?

01:24:13.478 --> 01:24:16.499
You are completely irrational.

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:20.139
Whereas you are completely rational.

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:23.139
You made a calculated decision

01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:25.339
to murder that lass

01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:30.341
to avoid being pulled in for his murder.

01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:34.499
And that's the truth of it,
isn't it, Richard?

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:37.140
That was your motive.

01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:41.701
I'm right, aren't I?

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.340
Lost your tongue?

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:52.179
OK, you don't want to speak.

01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:55.140
We'll just push on with the formalities.

01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:01.140
Right.

01:25:05.007 --> 01:25:07.007
Yeah, a quick sample should do it.

01:25:07.032 --> 01:25:09.032
Yeah, DNA for Danielle

01:25:09.057 --> 01:25:11.057
and fingerprints for Mr Desai.

01:25:11.082 --> 01:25:13.082
If you do this...

01:25:13.107 --> 01:25:14.634
...you send me down

01:25:14.667 --> 01:25:16.139
and I will come for you!

01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:18.139
Oh...

01:25:19.141 --> 01:25:21.901
And how are you going to do that, hm?

01:25:23.047 --> 01:25:25.047
And don't tell me you know people.

01:25:26.019 --> 01:25:28.019
I've been threatened
by worse than you, pet.

01:25:28.461 --> 01:25:31.140
And if you think those types
are going to help you...

01:25:31.946 --> 01:25:33.946
...you're more stupid than you look.

01:25:37.747 --> 01:25:40.907
DCI Stanhope leaving the room.

01:25:40.932 --> 01:25:43.661
Right, pet.

01:26:07.793 --> 01:26:10.115
Dani had no idea
what she was walking into.

01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:12.139
I should have known.

01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:15.139
I knew there was a problem.
If I'd have pushed it...

01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:16.179
Why didn't she come to us?

01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:18.661
Oh, my best guess...

01:26:19.993 --> 01:26:21.993
...she didn't want to ruin the night.

01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:24.660
I wouldn't have minded.

01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:28.820
Why did she not come and get me?
Why go off with him?

01:26:29.193 --> 01:26:31.513
She wanted to hear his side.

01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:34.139
Give him a chance to explain.

01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:35.980
Give Paula the benefit.

01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:39.635
Did Paula know all this time?

01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:41.140
Did she?

01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:44.979
When I was grieving...

01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:46.140
...did she?

01:26:46.829 --> 01:26:49.140
I think not.

01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:57.140
Yeah.

01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:02.140
OK. No, that's good news.

01:27:02.413 --> 01:27:03.413
Yeah.

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:06.659
OK, well, keep me posted on everything.

01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:08.140
Thank you.

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:10.500
Ta-da!

01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:13.340
- What do you think?
- About what?

01:27:13.793 --> 01:27:15.273
This.

01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:20.381
- I don't know what I'm looking at.
- Perfect!

01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:33.021
Oh, that lass
who Ross assaulted at the hotel,

01:27:33.022 --> 01:27:34.819
she's agreed to file a complaint.

01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:37.139
The CPS should have enough
to prosecute him, then.

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:38.140
Oh, aye.

01:27:38.141 --> 01:27:41.139
God, it takes a lot of courage
for her to do that.

01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:42.561
A lot of courage.

01:27:42.586 --> 01:27:44.139
I wish more people would do the same.

01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:47.851
Well, I think people are nowadays,
aren't they?

01:27:47.852 --> 01:27:49.140
And thank God for it.

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:53.140
It was a different story back in my day.

01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:58.139
Right, now, don't let Kenny
keep you out too late.

01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:51.140
