00:00.187 --> 00:01.406
This is Alex.

00:01.431 --> 00:02.952
- Your partner?
- Yeah.

00:03.620 --> 00:04.939
He's a genius.

00:05.090 --> 00:07.132
He went to university at the age of 15.

00:07.470 --> 00:10.683
The people I work with are inscrutable.

00:13.185 --> 00:14.385
Alex?

00:19.060 --> 00:21.200
What kind of relationship
did you have with him?

00:21.606 --> 00:23.036
Did it involve sadism?

00:23.310 --> 00:24.510
No.

00:35.884 --> 00:37.454
I could never hurt Danny.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.320
Because he is the only friend I have.

00:41.744 --> 00:43.309
This man is called Alistair,

00:43.825 --> 00:45.215
his parents are alive.

00:45.971 --> 00:49.626
Is it possible you enjoyed
extreme sexual encounters

00:49.651 --> 00:52.131
with someone who didn't
want you to know their name?

00:53.112 --> 00:54.752
He worked for MI6.

00:55.740 --> 00:57.080
He was a spy.

00:57.250 --> 01:00.699
The police were concerned you might have
taken something from the crime scene.

01:00.700 --> 01:03.170
A personal item,
something of sentimental value.

01:03.557 --> 01:05.266
You wouldn't have done that, would you?

01:05.949 --> 01:07.149
Of course not.

01:07.173 --> 01:08.633
No, of course not.

07:10.771 --> 07:12.111
Your newspaper has

07:13.020 --> 07:16.045
reported a series of lies.

07:19.689 --> 07:20.969
It's not the truth.

07:21.998 --> 07:23.898
You need to tell them the truth.

07:26.019 --> 07:27.369
You need to listen to me!

07:32.809 --> 07:34.019
I'm here today

07:35.769 --> 07:38.089
to tell you the truth.

07:40.909 --> 07:42.829
I'm here today to tell you the truth.

07:44.989 --> 07:47.099
I'm here today to tell you the truth.

07:49.929 --> 07:52.059
I'm here today to tell you the truth.

07:52.679 --> 07:54.139
You fuck!

07:54.479 --> 07:56.789
I'm here today to tell you the truth!

08:51.289 --> 08:54.299
In your phone call you asked
how it all works.

08:54.619 --> 08:56.689
We took that as negotiating payment.

08:58.039 --> 08:59.389
Oh, no.
Erm...

09:01.119 --> 09:03.958
I have never spoken to a journalist before.

09:05.649 --> 09:06.969
I don't want money.

09:09.129 --> 09:10.789
I'm here to tell you the truth.

09:20.399 --> 09:24.119
You used the word "partners"
to describe your relationship.

09:25.029 --> 09:27.519
- Yeah, we were partners.
- What do you mean by that?

09:27.604 --> 09:30.334
Erm, I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with him.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.299
You'd been together eight months?

09:36.619 --> 09:37.819
Yeah.

09:38.719 --> 09:42.250
During those eight months,
how many times had you visited the attic?

09:42.459 --> 09:44.149
I'd never visited the attic.

09:45.999 --> 09:47.769
Apart from when I discovered...

09:51.779 --> 09:54.269
That was the only time,
that was the first time.

09:55.739 --> 09:57.879
- But you must have known about it?
- No.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.907
The activities that went on up there?

09:59.931 --> 10:04.234
Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you...
I don't think anything did go on up there.

10:05.959 --> 10:08.959
I never saw him use those items,

10:09.584 --> 10:12.169
I never heard him talk about those things.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.759
You were his sexual partner for eight months.

10:15.269 --> 10:18.584
He never mentioned sadism?
Never asked you to participate?

10:18.799 --> 10:22.009
Never discussed his predilections?
You know nothing?

10:22.034 --> 10:24.784
Why won't you ask me
what I think happened to him?

10:25.169 --> 10:26.659
What do you think happened to him?

10:27.549 --> 10:28.799
He was murdered.

10:30.619 --> 10:31.849
Who murdered him?

10:33.199 --> 10:34.399
I don't know.

10:34.479 --> 10:35.919
Why did they murder him?

11:02.119 --> 11:03.319
Not here.

11:06.829 --> 11:08.069
You don't use his name.

11:09.629 --> 11:11.299
Is it true you didn't even know it?

11:21.489 --> 11:24.149
Did he ever tell you he was in danger?

11:25.349 --> 11:26.549
No.

11:27.929 --> 11:29.129
OK, I get it.

11:29.569 --> 11:32.979
He's a spy, he needed to be careful.
You met by chance.

11:33.379 --> 11:34.999
First day, he lied.

11:35.739 --> 11:39.018
But eight months later you want to
spend the rest of your lives together

11:39.051 --> 11:42.202
and you're still using the wrong name
to say how much you love him?

11:44.539 --> 11:46.228
He told me his name was Alex.

11:46.253 --> 11:47.883
People lie, Danny.

11:48.329 --> 11:49.529
And they lie well.

11:50.357 --> 11:53.202
Guys who own rooms like that attic...

11:54.128 --> 11:57.799
When it comes to sex,
they know what they want, how they want it.

11:58.569 --> 12:01.101
The sex is professional.

12:03.685 --> 12:05.705
And he didn't know what he enjoyed.

12:09.142 --> 12:10.412
He'd never found out.

12:20.164 --> 12:21.364
Do you believe me?

12:22.744 --> 12:24.604
It doesn't matter what I believe.

12:26.414 --> 12:29.494
But, yes...
I do.

12:39.874 --> 12:42.244
Journalists make difficult bedfellows.

12:42.914 --> 12:44.794
You can't just tell them what to print.

12:45.904 --> 12:49.629
- You didn't want to discuss it with me first?
- I knew you'd try and talk me out of it.

12:50.094 --> 12:51.914
Make me think what a dumb idea it was.

12:53.764 --> 12:54.964
What is this?

12:56.174 --> 12:57.380
Mistrust?

12:59.064 --> 13:00.264
It is.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.514
I see.

13:04.404 --> 13:08.554
You trusted me with your life,
but not now, not with this!

13:09.894 --> 13:14.134
My life is small, this is
organisations, institutions.

13:15.987 --> 13:18.207
You see me as one of them, don't you?

13:19.024 --> 13:20.983
The suit, the education, the job...

13:20.984 --> 13:23.764
- I'm part of the Establishment.
- Well, aren't you?

13:24.994 --> 13:27.111
How dare you, young man!

13:28.254 --> 13:30.308
How dare you presume to know me.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.993
I know you because I've heard
every secret you have to tell.

13:33.071 --> 13:34.421
What do you know about me?

13:34.994 --> 13:36.194
Answer me.

13:36.354 --> 13:38.934
- I know...
- You know where I live.

13:39.494 --> 13:42.403
You know what films I like,
you know what music I listen to.

13:42.474 --> 13:44.964
Did you know that I suffer from depression?

13:45.904 --> 13:49.023
Did you know that in the past
I drank every night,

13:49.115 --> 13:50.896
every day, every morning,

13:50.936 --> 13:54.426
I drank until a stranger
could smell it on me!

13:55.464 --> 13:59.455
Do you know just how fucking far I am
from being part of the Establishment?

14:00.784 --> 14:03.784
How dare you mistrust me

14:05.084 --> 14:06.464
when you don't know!

14:11.764 --> 14:13.340
You want to know who I am,

14:13.934 --> 14:15.344
who I really am

14:16.764 --> 14:17.964
I'll show you.

14:41.004 --> 14:42.204
Where we going?

14:43.124 --> 14:46.184
Come on. Then you can decide
whether you trust me or not.

15:04.804 --> 15:08.384
This is the spot where my career
as a spy came to an end.

15:12.684 --> 15:13.914
I was a spy

15:14.910 --> 15:16.220
a long time ago.

15:18.514 --> 15:20.414
In a world very different to this one.

15:26.784 --> 15:28.414
I was recruited at Cambridge.

15:32.284 --> 15:36.334
I said yes partly because it wouldn't
be a normal life, with regular hours.

15:37.904 --> 15:41.064
I was desperate to avoid
the five o'clock home time

15:43.184 --> 15:47.174
whilst not being bohemian enough
to imagine life without a proper profession.

15:52.704 --> 15:55.154
Not very patriotic motives, I suppose.

15:57.914 --> 16:01.414
But they rather liked that about me,
an utter lack of idealism.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.884
Romantics make unreliable spies.

16:15.050 --> 16:16.870
It was my third year with MI6.

16:18.864 --> 16:21.224
I was travelling back to London
on the night train.

16:23.394 --> 16:25.674
A handsome man entered my carriage

16:27.394 --> 16:28.694
sat opposite me.

16:30.324 --> 16:32.504
The tips of our shoes touched.

16:33.475 --> 16:35.275
Our eyes chanced.

16:35.934 --> 16:40.415
He asked the most mundane questions
in the most exciting way.

16:41.604 --> 16:44.738
When we arrived at Paddington,
I went to the gentlemen's

16:44.844 --> 16:47.743
and waited in a cubicle,

16:47.783 --> 16:50.619
door ajar, hoping.

16:55.614 --> 16:58.034
I can't tell you how happy I was to see him.

16:59.684 --> 17:01.531
It meant that I hadn't been wrong.

17:04.064 --> 17:07.114
And that for the next 15 minutes or so,
I wouldn't be alone.

17:12.827 --> 17:15.794
After all these years, prudishness runs deep.

17:20.784 --> 17:24.383
The next day,
I was approached by a Soviet operative

17:26.074 --> 17:31.125
who described how the Soviet Union
welcomed "Men like me".

17:32.394 --> 17:34.544
"Under Communism we're all equals."

17:35.954 --> 17:38.434
And once I'd completed my mission here,

17:39.114 --> 17:42.034
in a country that would always hate my kind,

17:42.354 --> 17:44.664
I could set up home in Moscow and be free.

17:47.144 --> 17:51.254
Some "men like me" actually believed
that lie, but I was not one of them.

17:53.404 --> 17:56.644
So all that remained was a blackmail.

18:00.024 --> 18:01.444
I'd be exposed.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.614
Arrested.

18:04.664 --> 18:05.864
Disgraced.

18:08.514 --> 18:09.784
So that night

18:11.354 --> 18:12.694
I bought a rope

18:14.094 --> 18:15.294
and came here.

18:17.044 --> 18:18.994
But sitting on that branch,

18:19.424 --> 18:20.744
noose ready,

18:22.554 --> 18:24.764
I thought to myself, "There is another way."

18:25.023 --> 18:26.663
You told your bosses you were gay.

18:28.394 --> 18:30.324
That's a wonderful wrong answer.

18:30.604 --> 18:32.813
However, the option did not yet exist.

18:33.599 --> 18:37.721
No, I explained to my section head

18:37.954 --> 18:40.544
that I'd been approached
by a Soviet operative

18:41.223 --> 18:43.177
and I detailed the nature of the blackmail.

18:43.202 --> 18:45.622
He asked if the allegations were true.

18:46.164 --> 18:49.394
I admitted that I'd made a mistake
with a man

18:50.844 --> 18:53.993
and that the operative probably
had evidence of that mistake.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.507
But it was only once.

18:56.114 --> 18:58.414
An act of disgusting madness.

18:59.334 --> 19:01.254
"I'm not a homosexual.

19:01.346 --> 19:02.806
And I'm not a treater."

19:05.154 --> 19:09.115
Hard for them to believe the second statement
when they knew that the first was a lie.

19:09.404 --> 19:11.893
So I proposed, preposterously,

19:11.927 --> 19:14.393
they employ someone to follow me
for the rest of my life,

19:14.418 --> 19:16.344
photograph my every move,

19:16.464 --> 19:18.994
I would never touch another man.

19:19.914 --> 19:23.966
I didn't discover until later
that there haven't been a Soviet operative.

19:24.624 --> 19:27.014
There'd been an internal investigation.

19:27.984 --> 19:29.714
You've heard of a mole hunt?

19:30.164 --> 19:31.703
Well, this was a fag hunt,

19:31.749 --> 19:34.024
which they saw
as more or less the same thing.

19:35.104 --> 19:37.661
Her Majesty's Secret Service
had had its fingers burnt

19:37.686 --> 19:39.667
by one too many queer spies.

19:39.984 --> 19:42.740
But my prompt confession saved my life.

19:44.194 --> 19:48.303
I was moved from MI6 into what
was then named Ministry for Transport

19:48.343 --> 19:50.203
where I was little more than a penpusher,

19:50.258 --> 19:52.398
whispered about by those in the know.

19:55.451 --> 19:58.601
Out of gratitude and fear,
I kept my end of the bargain.

20:01.714 --> 20:04.544
And for 11 years,
I did not touch another man.

20:25.694 --> 20:26.894
Will you sleep?

20:31.244 --> 20:33.797
Then I propose we stay up all night

20:33.822 --> 20:36.014
and wait of the morning paper together.

21:57.694 --> 21:59.174
- In my office.
- Huh?

22:04.954 --> 22:06.244
Drug-test me.

22:10.654 --> 22:11.854
I need this.

22:23.754 --> 22:25.494
It's from his parents.

23:31.904 --> 23:33.244
Mr and Mrs Turner.

23:47.194 --> 23:49.134
Beautiful countryside around here.

24:10.324 --> 24:11.814
How long have you lived here?

24:16.294 --> 24:18.024
Didn't Alistair tell you?

24:19.234 --> 24:20.434
No.

24:20.804 --> 24:22.744
What did he tell you about us?

24:24.234 --> 24:26.921
The truth, please.

24:28.784 --> 24:30.354
He told me you were dead.

24:32.574 --> 24:34.014
We weren't close.

25:07.604 --> 25:10.434
Bathroom's opposite.
It's all yours.

25:18.604 --> 25:21.062
- Is one towel enough?
- Plenty.

26:01.858 --> 26:03.324
We've already eaten.

26:03.934 --> 26:05.834
We won't stand here and watch.

26:37.234 --> 26:39.394
- How was dinner?
- Fine.

26:53.144 --> 26:55.244
Alistair, tell me about him.

27:11.914 --> 27:13.554
Will you be able to sleep?

27:14.332 --> 27:15.532
Probably not.

27:18.184 --> 27:20.074
Alistair suffered from insomnia.

27:20.294 --> 27:23.778
Well, that's why he enjoyed running so much.
To exhaust him.

27:24.564 --> 27:26.494
His mind was so busy,

27:27.204 --> 27:29.224
he ran so he could sleep.

27:40.912 --> 27:42.412
Why can't you talk to me?

29:02.064 --> 29:03.554
Time to talk.

29:07.931 --> 29:09.141
You read the article?

29:11.303 --> 29:13.443
We're not making any judgements.

29:16.873 --> 29:18.633
You see the life we lead.

29:18.973 --> 29:20.403
We're private people,

29:21.313 --> 29:23.113
we don't want attention.

29:23.823 --> 29:27.603
The past is the past.
What Alistair did in London was up to him.

29:28.023 --> 29:29.383
He was an adult.

29:30.323 --> 29:32.153
We can't bring him back.

29:32.603 --> 29:34.453
We'd just prefer it

29:34.593 --> 29:36.303
if there was no fuss.

29:38.513 --> 29:40.953
We'd both prefer it.

29:42.463 --> 29:45.090
- I won't talk to the press again.
- That's good.

29:45.753 --> 29:47.763
But nobody was saying it, so I had to.

29:48.373 --> 29:49.723
Your son was murdered.

29:50.803 --> 29:53.970
After breakfast, why don't we go for a walk?

30:05.583 --> 30:07.013
Your son was murdered.

30:08.343 --> 30:09.633
My son is dead.

30:10.223 --> 30:11.743
My wife is sick.

30:13.193 --> 30:15.780
- I'm sorry.
- Enough.

30:18.051 --> 30:19.251
Enough?

30:50.676 --> 30:53.496
We need to leave soon
if we're to catch your train.

30:55.873 --> 30:58.625
That is not his bedroom.

31:02.863 --> 31:04.173
This is not his home.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.005
Have you lost your mind?

31:07.523 --> 31:08.723
Who are you?

31:11.863 --> 31:13.063
Who are you?

31:21.993 --> 31:23.193
'Bring him.'

31:26.228 --> 31:27.428
Who was that?

31:27.956 --> 31:30.086
That was Alistair's mother.

31:34.853 --> 31:36.053
His mother?

31:42.463 --> 31:44.438
- What does she want?
- To meet you.

31:49.923 --> 31:52.123
- How far is it?
- Not far.

32:47.983 --> 32:49.473
Anything else you want to see?

32:49.613 --> 32:52.883
Not everyone is comfortable
inviting strangers to their home.

32:55.083 --> 32:58.383
We thought if you saw where we lived
you might try to extort us.

32:58.633 --> 33:00.723
Why do you think I would want your money?

33:00.773 --> 33:01.973
Because you have none.

33:02.733 --> 33:03.933
You want an apology?

33:04.035 --> 33:05.634
I gave you an explanation.

33:06.423 --> 33:08.640
You...
I believe.

33:10.463 --> 33:13.902
My husband's name is Charles.
My name is Frances.

33:14.004 --> 33:16.079
My son's name was Alistair.

33:16.993 --> 33:19.143
Your name, Daniel, we read in the paper.

33:19.703 --> 33:21.232
My staff you met.

33:21.320 --> 33:22.902
Where's she taking my stuff?

33:22.934 --> 33:25.202
Well, surely you're going to spend the night?

33:49.523 --> 33:53.193
We're in the midst of restoring the house
to its former glory.

33:57.313 --> 33:59.873
We had hoped Alistair would finish the task.

34:27.991 --> 34:29.358
This is his room.

34:31.183 --> 34:32.382
How did you know?

34:45.393 --> 34:47.882
Because it's the loneliest room
I've ever been in.

35:05.990 --> 35:09.583
Charles was sure you'd catch
the train home today, none the wiser.

35:09.909 --> 35:12.319
I was convinced you'd figure it out.

35:12.783 --> 35:15.813
It seems you did so not
with reason or deduction

35:17.053 --> 35:19.083
but something akin to

35:19.930 --> 35:21.344
female intuition.

35:28.033 --> 35:29.523
I won't sleep in here.

35:32.576 --> 35:34.191
I would never have allowed it.

35:41.483 --> 35:44.442
- Dinner is at eight.
- You're embarrassed by his death.

35:46.993 --> 35:48.193
Yes.

35:50.329 --> 35:51.529
Upset, too?

35:54.213 --> 35:56.847
Yes.
More than you can imagine.

38:17.203 --> 38:19.292
Did you realise
your provocation was infantile

38:19.316 --> 38:21.916
before or after you came through that door?

38:25.193 --> 38:28.639
Before, I see.
But you didn't decide to change?

38:33.363 --> 38:34.645
Would you like me to?

38:35.913 --> 38:37.113
No.

38:37.963 --> 38:39.633
I think I prefer you like that.

38:49.600 --> 38:50.800
Thank you.

39:06.783 --> 39:09.722
Alistair completed that maze unassisted,

39:10.253 --> 39:12.408
three months before his fifth birthday.

39:18.733 --> 39:20.903
Others considered him to be disturbed,

39:21.125 --> 39:23.788
but what they saw
as a disturbance of the mind

39:24.653 --> 39:26.966
was, in fact, an exceptional gift.

39:28.403 --> 39:31.222
However, it's not enough in this world
to be born brilliant

39:31.324 --> 39:33.865
you need direction and discipline.

39:34.763 --> 39:37.072
You need someone who reminds you,
day after day,

39:37.097 --> 39:39.407
never to waste your talent on triviality.

39:40.643 --> 39:43.278
How many brilliant minds
are out there right now

39:43.623 --> 39:45.614
rotting in squalor and neglect?

39:47.463 --> 39:51.672
It took every ounce of my strength
to make Alistair realise his potential.

39:54.163 --> 39:56.083
He ended up hating me for it.

39:58.723 --> 40:00.296
But you guessed that already.

40:05.003 --> 40:06.493
Your son was murdered.

40:09.623 --> 40:11.203
The attic was staged.

40:15.523 --> 40:17.843
And everything you've read
about his death is a lie.

40:25.513 --> 40:28.077
After dinner,
perhaps you will join me for a drink.

40:46.053 --> 40:47.443
My son wasn't gay.

40:48.532 --> 40:51.713
Before you hold some sort
of parade through the house, hear me out.

40:52.123 --> 40:55.845
Alistair didn't think like ordinary people.

40:56.343 --> 40:58.493
He didn't feel what ordinary people feel.

41:00.013 --> 41:01.993
In his eyes, everyone was a puzzle.

41:02.593 --> 41:04.762
He took immense satisfaction

41:04.857 --> 41:06.747
figuring out what a person wanted

41:07.433 --> 41:08.923
and then giving it to them.

41:09.623 --> 41:11.383
As if we were all computers...

41:14.727 --> 41:16.597
Waiting for the correct code.

41:20.073 --> 41:23.113
Alistair could be anything a person
wanted him to be.

41:23.613 --> 41:26.413
In your case, it appears you craved romance,

41:26.913 --> 41:28.733
a good old-fashioned love story.

41:29.565 --> 41:30.903
He gave it to you.

41:32.219 --> 41:36.676
Meanwhile, he continued
giving other kinds of stimulation

41:36.701 --> 41:39.454
to other kinds of people, men and women.

41:42.935 --> 41:46.095
If he was involved with someone
who hankered after risk,

41:47.373 --> 41:48.820
he would have provided it.

41:50.893 --> 41:53.963
Danger, pain, submission, domination.

41:54.553 --> 41:57.663
Alistair was as precocious sexually

41:58.243 --> 41:59.758
as he was intellectually.

42:00.403 --> 42:02.273
To him, they were one and the same.

42:02.374 --> 42:04.694
Sex was just another form of decryption.

42:08.183 --> 42:09.383
You think I'm cruel?

42:10.163 --> 42:11.363
Perhaps I am.

42:13.493 --> 42:15.113
But not in this instance.

42:15.743 --> 42:17.523
I wanted to preserve your illusions.

42:19.169 --> 42:21.069
We had hoped that you would go home

42:21.213 --> 42:24.284
and mourn in the belief that
your relationship was perfect.

42:26.563 --> 42:28.163
You loved him, I see that.

42:29.603 --> 42:32.540
However, I cannot allow you
to be unaware of the facts,

42:32.953 --> 42:36.910
in case you blunder further into a
situation you simply do not understand.

42:38.493 --> 42:40.662
I'm not surprised he used a different name.

42:40.717 --> 42:42.147
He was playing a part.

42:42.673 --> 42:45.281
The part of a conventional lover.

42:50.443 --> 42:51.963
I haven't read many books.

42:54.013 --> 42:56.403
I haven't been to many places.

42:59.983 --> 43:02.482
But I have fucked a lot of people.

43:05.703 --> 43:09.494
And there's one thing you just can't fake.

43:11.923 --> 43:13.203
Inexperience.

43:17.547 --> 43:19.947
The body's tense when it should be relaxed.

43:21.783 --> 43:24.583
It hurts when it should be fun.

43:26.403 --> 43:28.423
And it's dirty when it should be clean.

43:31.933 --> 43:33.693
I don't care how smart you are,

43:34.093 --> 43:35.583
your muscles can't lie.

43:36.514 --> 43:40.324
I'm talking about feeling his inexperience

43:40.483 --> 43:42.565
as clearly as I can feel this glass.

43:43.273 --> 43:45.023
Do you follow me, Frances?

43:46.583 --> 43:47.783
I can see you do.

43:47.973 --> 43:51.273
So I know for a fact you're lying.

43:54.093 --> 43:57.163
I know for a fact
that your son, the man I loved,

43:58.123 --> 43:59.323
was a virgin.

43:59.943 --> 44:03.882
What I don't understand is why you're
so keen to convince me otherwise.

44:15.443 --> 44:18.232
When he told me you were dead,
he wasn't lying, was he?

44:20.903 --> 44:24.114
Amongst all the lies
you've heard here this weekend,

44:24.743 --> 44:26.253
recognise one truth...

44:26.733 --> 44:28.109
"no fuss"

44:28.833 --> 44:31.474
is the best piece of advice
you will ever be given.

47:06.893 --> 47:08.363
I prefer it down here.

47:11.123 --> 47:13.223
- She won't like it.
- No.

47:14.643 --> 47:15.843
I don't think she will.

47:23.743 --> 47:25.023
You cared about him.

47:28.183 --> 47:29.383
You cared for him.

47:31.163 --> 47:34.141
If he had a problem,
he came to you, didn't he?

47:36.533 --> 47:37.733
Not her.

47:44.823 --> 47:46.023
You loved him.

47:54.353 --> 47:55.553
Alex.

47:57.403 --> 47:58.603
Alex.

48:07.503 --> 48:09.443
He hated the name Alistair.

48:18.083 --> 48:19.463
What happened here?

48:22.273 --> 48:24.863
Get as far away from these people as you can.

48:32.583 --> 48:33.933
He insisted.

49:54.993 --> 49:56.724
I want to tell you a story

49:58.043 --> 49:59.243
about a man.

50:01.823 --> 50:03.493
While everyone was laughing

50:03.953 --> 50:05.153
and drinking,

50:06.073 --> 50:07.493
he would just walk

50:09.743 --> 50:12.223
until he reached the exact same spot,

50:13.283 --> 50:16.099
where he'd sit with his back
to all those people.

50:19.423 --> 50:21.459
And while he did everything he possibly could

50:21.513 --> 50:24.533
to signal to the world
that he wanted to be left alone,

50:26.813 --> 50:28.013
more than anything,

50:28.313 --> 50:30.145
he hoped that someone passing

50:31.103 --> 50:34.673
would understand that what he
really wanted was the exact opposite.

50:35.533 --> 50:38.273
And that this someone would sit next to him

50:40.873 --> 50:42.553
and strike up a conversation.

50:46.583 --> 50:47.783
I was that man

50:49.943 --> 50:51.418
and you were that someone.

50:54.663 --> 50:55.863
I have a sweet tooth.

50:59.916 --> 51:02.556
It's easier to quit smoking, I swear.

51:08.713 --> 51:11.158
Not very British,
talking to strangers, is it?

51:11.943 --> 51:15.673
I've worked in your country
for ten years now.

51:26.103 --> 51:27.303
Do you own a house?

51:28.623 --> 51:30.813
- No.
- A car?

51:31.863 --> 51:33.163
No, nothing.

51:33.593 --> 51:34.983
Well, you have your health.

51:38.473 --> 51:40.923
That's the most precious asset of all.

51:41.853 --> 51:43.053
My health?

51:48.853 --> 51:51.103
Lots of people
think they have nothing to lose,

51:52.904 --> 51:55.224
but in my professional experience,

51:55.543 --> 51:57.463
they just haven't thought it through.

51:58.663 --> 52:00.603
- Are you threatening me?
- Threatening?

52:02.463 --> 52:03.985
My, oh, my.

52:04.793 --> 52:06.743
This is just a conversation,

52:07.183 --> 52:08.603
a chitchat.

52:09.313 --> 52:11.693
Two people passing in the night.

52:12.693 --> 52:14.811
I can see why you're so confused,

52:15.153 --> 52:18.497
over the years I've adopted
quite a few of your country's customs,

52:18.567 --> 52:22.615
but that Great British reserve escapes me.
I enjoy talking too much.

52:24.373 --> 52:25.573
And, once in a while,

52:25.574 --> 52:28.866
someone unexpected tells you something

52:30.533 --> 52:32.730
that might save your life.

52:40.733 --> 52:43.284
Be sure to put that card someplace safe.

52:46.830 --> 52:49.146
PROTECTING LIVES
& PROPERTY FOR 80 YEARS

54:17.253 --> 54:20.344
- You think my house is bugged?
- I've just been threatened.

54:21.073 --> 54:22.843
They...
Heard us.

54:23.393 --> 54:25.833
- Who?
- The people who murdered Alex.

54:27.663 --> 54:28.863
All right.

54:30.873 --> 54:33.443
Suppose he was murdered,
suppose you're right.

54:34.123 --> 54:35.463
Follow it through,

54:36.053 --> 54:38.363
the implications of what you're saying.

54:39.163 --> 54:40.973
You know nothing about them,

54:41.393 --> 54:43.993
they will know everything about you.

54:44.063 --> 54:47.330
Every action you take
will have been predicted, planned for

54:47.371 --> 54:49.064
even coming here tonight.

54:52.363 --> 54:54.993
And if they don't kill you,
it'll be for one reason.

54:55.593 --> 54:58.683
They consider you
less of a nuisance alive than dead.

54:59.983 --> 55:02.582
If you're insulted by the idea
of your insignificance,

55:02.607 --> 55:04.907
you shouldn't be, you should cherish it.

55:05.263 --> 55:07.751
No daring journalist is going
to come to your aid,

55:07.776 --> 55:09.552
no rogue police officer.

55:09.604 --> 55:13.705
It's just you alone, Danny.
Ask yourself, honestly, who are you?

55:15.233 --> 55:19.242
You're friends with everyone,
you trust everyone, and you know no-one.

55:19.297 --> 55:20.497
You know these people.

55:20.522 --> 55:22.875
- I knew them 40 years ago.
- Help me.

55:27.343 --> 55:30.573
One way or another,
I've been afraid for much of my life,

55:30.713 --> 55:34.272
and it's a privilege to spend time
with a man who's never afraid of anything.

55:34.358 --> 55:36.795
And that's not because you
were born in a different time.

55:37.303 --> 55:38.653
You're fearless.

55:40.033 --> 55:42.681
I've always wondered how that must feel.
But, Danny,

55:43.681 --> 55:46.658
occasionally, it's right to be afraid.

55:47.443 --> 55:48.683
Leave this alone.

55:50.553 --> 55:51.753
Promise me.
