WEBVTT

00:08.458 --> 00:10.291
Kade, above you.

00:11.917 --> 00:12.959
Thanks, Dad.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.375
But you don't need to worry.

00:14.417 --> 00:15.875
Heatwave and I are

00:14.417 --> 00:15.875
on top of it.

00:16.625 --> 00:17.625
I know you are.

00:17.667 --> 00:19.375
But be sure to investigate

00:19.417 --> 00:22.875
why the automated sprinkler

00:19.417 --> 00:22.875
system didn't activate.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.375
Whoa, it--

00:34.000 --> 00:35.291
All right, Jerry.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.834
Tag the scrap

00:35.333 --> 00:37.834
and unleash the beast.

00:44.959 --> 00:47.375
Graham, you positive

00:44.959 --> 00:47.375
all the nanites

00:47.417 --> 00:48.834
were removed

00:47.417 --> 00:48.834
from the scrapmaster?

00:48.875 --> 00:50.208
Don't want another rampage.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.000
All checked out, Dad.

00:52.041 --> 00:54.750
I guess Cody isn't available to

00:52.041 --> 00:54.750
work the command center today.

00:54.792 --> 00:56.417
No, he's over at--

00:56.458 --> 00:59.500
The scooter race. I'm late.

00:59.542 --> 01:02.250
CROWD:

00:59.542 --> 01:02.250
Isn't it great?

00:59.542 --> 01:02.250
It's starting.

01:02.291 --> 01:04.792
Sorry.

01:02.291 --> 01:04.792
You'll love it.

02:26.208 --> 02:27.709
That's close call, Chase.

02:27.750 --> 02:28.834
Way too close.

02:28.875 --> 02:29.917
Thanks.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.834
Cody, what happened?

02:33.875 --> 02:36.542
A garbage truck just drove

02:33.875 --> 02:36.542
right onto the course.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.250
That does it.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.250
No more races downtown.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.000
It's too dangerous.

02:40.041 --> 02:43.625
Rest assured, I will be issuing

02:40.041 --> 02:43.625
a citation for this offense.

02:43.667 --> 02:46.709
Afraid there's no one to ticket

02:43.667 --> 02:46.709
on an automated truck, Chase.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.834
Then, where does lie the blame?

02:48.875 --> 02:51.208
That's a question for the mayor.

02:51.250 --> 02:54.583
I blame the central computer.

02:54.625 --> 02:56.041
It's outdated.

02:56.083 --> 02:58.875
It can't even control

02:56.083 --> 02:58.875
the simplest technology.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.041
Fire sprinklers not sprinkling.

03:01.083 --> 03:03.333
Cars swerving

03:01.083 --> 03:03.333
off mountain roads.

03:03.375 --> 03:05.834
Garbage trucks

03:03.375 --> 03:05.834
changing course willy-nilly.

03:05.875 --> 03:07.792
And that's just today.

03:07.834 --> 03:11.583
The time has come to replace

03:07.834 --> 03:11.583
our tired old central computer

03:11.625 --> 03:14.250
with a brand-spanking new model.

03:14.291 --> 03:16.834
So new, in fact,

03:14.291 --> 03:16.834
that Griffin Rock

03:16.875 --> 03:20.000
will be the first town

03:16.875 --> 03:20.000
to ever test it.

03:20.041 --> 03:21.917
Finally, not just some,

03:21.959 --> 03:25.000
but all of our technology

03:21.959 --> 03:25.000
will be controlled

03:25.041 --> 03:26.959
by one reliable source.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.709
So without further ado,

03:29.750 --> 03:33.500
may I present

03:29.750 --> 03:33.500
the Vigilant computer.

03:42.792 --> 03:43.875
Greetings.

03:43.917 --> 03:45.959
My name is Vigil.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.875
I am here to make

03:47.917 --> 03:53.333
insert name of town here

03:47.917 --> 03:53.333
100 percent accident free.

03:53.375 --> 03:56.875
Obviously, not fully

03:53.375 --> 03:56.875
operational, yet.

03:56.917 --> 04:01.667
Because accidents do not happen

03:56.917 --> 04:01.667
in a Vigilant town.

04:06.959 --> 04:09.250
Chief, have your machines

04:06.959 --> 04:09.250
load this onto the truck.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.750
Doc Greene is waiting

04:09.291 --> 04:11.750
to install it.

04:11.792 --> 04:14.166
Robots, proceed.

04:14.208 --> 04:17.458
If nothing else,

04:14.208 --> 04:17.458
the computer sounds friendly.

04:17.500 --> 04:18.709
Creepy, isn't it?

04:18.750 --> 04:20.458
I read about the Vigilant.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.458
It really can tap into and

04:20.500 --> 04:23.458
control nearly any technology.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.834
But do we really need a computer

04:23.500 --> 04:26.834
taking over so much of the town?

04:26.875 --> 04:29.625
If it helps keep you all safe,

04:26.875 --> 04:29.625
yes.

04:29.667 --> 04:32.583
Seems our calls are getting more

04:29.667 --> 04:32.583
and more dangerous these days.

04:39.625 --> 04:42.375
HEATWAVE:

04:39.625 --> 04:42.375
One hundred percent accident

04:39.625 --> 04:42.375
free?

04:42.417 --> 04:43.417
Impossible.

04:43.458 --> 04:45.291
Especially, in this town.

04:45.333 --> 04:46.625
I don't like any computer

04:46.667 --> 04:48.959
that makes promises

04:46.667 --> 04:48.959
it can't keep.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.709
But how wonderful would it be

04:50.750 --> 04:53.250
if Vigil actually can make

04:50.750 --> 04:53.250
Griffin Rock completely safe?

04:53.291 --> 04:54.667
It stands to reason,

04:54.709 --> 04:56.291
the less danger

04:54.709 --> 04:56.291
to everyone else,

04:56.333 --> 04:58.375
the less dangerous calls

04:56.333 --> 04:58.375
for rescuers.

04:58.417 --> 04:59.875
You're right.

04:59.917 --> 05:01.250
I like him.

05:01.291 --> 05:04.250
One, a computer is an it,

05:01.291 --> 05:04.250
not a him.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.291
And two,

05:04.291 --> 05:06.291
accidents will still happen

05:06.333 --> 05:08.375
because the world is

05:06.333 --> 05:08.375
unpredictable.

05:08.417 --> 05:10.750
I have a feeling

05:08.417 --> 05:10.750
we'll all still be plenty busy.

05:10.792 --> 05:11.875
( cell phone rings )

05:11.917 --> 05:13.959
Hello? Oh, hey, Frankie.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.917
FRANKIE ( over phone ):

05:14.000 --> 05:16.917
Hurry, Vigil's about

05:14.000 --> 05:16.917
to go online.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.959
Why did your father put

05:28.500 --> 05:30.959
the mainframe way down here?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.166
Protection.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.875
You should see

05:32.208 --> 05:33.875
the security system

05:33.917 --> 05:35.959
he had to install

05:33.917 --> 05:35.959
in all the lower levels.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.166
I don't see a security system.

05:38.208 --> 05:42.041
You won't until you try

05:38.208 --> 05:42.041
to break in, then bam.

05:42.083 --> 05:43.458
Bam?

05:43.500 --> 05:45.583
The computer's in a vault?

05:45.625 --> 05:47.917
In case bad guys

05:45.625 --> 05:47.917
like Doctor Morocco

05:47.959 --> 05:49.667
get past the sonic cannons.

05:58.375 --> 06:01.500
The Vigilant is an experimental

05:58.375 --> 06:01.500
prototype, Mayor.

06:01.542 --> 06:04.583
It should be tested

06:01.542 --> 06:04.583
before going fully online.

06:05.625 --> 06:08.041
Just let me reduce the--

06:08.083 --> 06:09.542
Nonsense.

06:09.583 --> 06:12.875
Griffin Rock doesn't tiptoe

06:09.583 --> 06:12.875
into the future, it strides.

06:12.917 --> 06:14.458
The time for action is now.

06:18.041 --> 06:21.583
Greetings, Mayor Luskey,

06:18.041 --> 06:21.583
Doctor Greene.

06:21.625 --> 06:22.875
Hello, Francine.

06:22.917 --> 06:25.000
Or would you prefer Frankie?

06:25.834 --> 06:28.125
Frankie is fine.

06:28.166 --> 06:29.583
Is this cool or what?

06:29.625 --> 06:31.875
And Cody, I look forward

06:31.917 --> 06:33.959
to working with you

06:31.917 --> 06:33.959
and your family

06:34.000 --> 06:37.208
in making Griffin Rock 100

06:34.000 --> 06:37.208
percent safe.

06:37.250 --> 06:40.166
How do you know who we are?

06:40.208 --> 06:44.375
I have access to the personal

06:40.208 --> 06:44.375
files of everyone in town.

06:44.417 --> 06:48.834
Okay, but how do you know

06:44.417 --> 06:48.834
we're here, now?

06:48.875 --> 06:51.125
I know everyone's positions

06:51.166 --> 06:53.542
by tracking

06:51.166 --> 06:53.542
their mobile-phone signals.

06:53.583 --> 06:57.333
Mayor, this invasion of privacy

06:53.583 --> 06:57.333
doesn't concern you?

06:57.375 --> 06:59.750
Small price to pay for safety.

06:59.792 --> 07:02.750
Vigil, the town is

06:59.792 --> 07:02.750
in your hands.

07:02.792 --> 07:05.917
That is if you had hands.

07:05.959 --> 07:09.500
I do have hands, Mayor,

07:05.959 --> 07:09.500
and eyes.

07:09.542 --> 07:11.667
Everywhere.

07:26.959 --> 07:28.208
Hello, Don.

07:32.834 --> 07:37.417
Point of fact, a yellow light

07:32.834 --> 07:37.417
means slow, not go.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.333
You are about

07:37.458 --> 07:39.333
to receive a citation.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.458
( tires screech )

07:41.500 --> 07:43.083
Have a safe day.

07:48.625 --> 07:51.291
Help. My baby.

07:51.333 --> 07:53.333
Heatwave.

08:08.250 --> 08:09.834
Is my baby okay?

08:09.875 --> 08:13.250
There, there, hush, little baby.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.792
Elsie is fine, Mrs. Rubio.

08:15.834 --> 08:17.625
Because I made sure of it.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.250
CODY:

08:19.625 --> 08:21.250
Griffin Rock emergency.

08:22.291 --> 08:23.959
A fire at the junkyard?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.333
I'll send the team right now.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.208
Hey, out of the way.

08:39.250 --> 08:42.959
For reasons unknown,

08:39.250 --> 08:42.959
I am unable to gain control

08:43.000 --> 08:45.458
of your rescue vehicles, Kade.

08:45.500 --> 08:50.000
Therefore, I must keep you out

08:45.500 --> 08:50.000
of the junkyard by other means.

08:50.041 --> 08:52.709
Are you preventing us

08:50.041 --> 08:52.709
from doing our jobs, Vigil?

08:52.750 --> 08:55.458
The fire has spread

08:52.750 --> 08:55.458
to propane tanks.

08:55.500 --> 08:59.709
With explosions imminent,

08:55.500 --> 08:59.709
your safety would be at risk.

09:04.792 --> 09:07.375
Dad, Jerry is in there

09:04.792 --> 09:07.375
by the tanks.

09:07.417 --> 09:08.667
He's unconscious.

09:08.709 --> 09:10.875
You are mistaken, Cody.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.667
Jerry has been detected

09:10.917 --> 09:13.667
at his home.

09:13.709 --> 09:19.333
Therefore, I am barring anyone

09:13.709 --> 09:19.333
from entering this facility.

09:28.834 --> 09:30.125
Team, you know the drill.

09:49.041 --> 09:52.000
MAN:

09:49.041 --> 09:52.000
Oh, I can't see

09:49.041 --> 09:52.000
through the smoke.

09:52.041 --> 09:53.333
Cody, where's Jerry?

09:53.375 --> 09:54.834
If you drop straight down,

09:54.875 --> 09:56.875
he'll be about 15 feet

09:54.875 --> 09:56.875
in front of you.

10:02.709 --> 10:04.333
I see him.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.709
Jerry, we're getting you out.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.792
But we have to hurry.

10:30.667 --> 10:31.959
Jerry, are you okay?

10:37.417 --> 10:40.333
Vigil, do you understand

10:37.417 --> 10:40.333
what just happened here?

10:40.375 --> 10:41.667
I do not.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.750
Jerry was clearly detected

10:41.709 --> 10:44.750
at his residence.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.834
That's because he left his phone

10:44.792 --> 10:46.834
at home.

10:46.875 --> 10:48.625
Jerry does that all the time.

10:48.667 --> 10:50.083
Yeah, lots of people do.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.125
You can't rely on tracking us

10:50.125 --> 10:52.125
that way.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.500
Then I will advise the mayor

10:54.542 --> 10:56.583
to make it mandatory

10:54.542 --> 10:56.583
for everyone

10:56.625 --> 11:01.750
to carry communication devices

10:56.625 --> 11:01.750
24 forward slash 7.

11:01.792 --> 11:03.917
Afraid that's not

11:01.792 --> 11:03.917
very realistic.

11:03.959 --> 11:06.583
Vigil, we're all after the same

11:03.959 --> 11:06.583
thing, right?

11:06.625 --> 11:09.333
Just try working with us,

11:06.625 --> 11:09.333
not against us.

11:09.375 --> 11:11.166
We cannot work together

11:11.208 --> 11:14.041
if I am unable

11:11.208 --> 11:14.041
to control your vehicles.

11:14.083 --> 11:18.792
In a Vigilant town,

11:14.083 --> 11:18.792
there can be only one voice.

11:18.834 --> 11:20.083
Mine.

11:20.125 --> 11:24.000
The Burns family must submit

11:20.125 --> 11:24.000
to me.

11:24.041 --> 11:26.208
Have a safe day.

11:39.875 --> 11:43.250
Okay, Vigil can't track us

11:39.875 --> 11:43.250
or hear us now.

11:43.291 --> 11:44.750
No hardware's telling me

11:43.291 --> 11:44.750
what to do--

11:44.792 --> 11:46.208
A computer making judgment

11:44.792 --> 11:46.208
calls--

11:46.250 --> 11:47.458
He sounds so friendly.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.875
A formal complaint should be

11:47.500 --> 11:48.875
lodged.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.250
Okay, okay.

11:50.291 --> 11:53.166
Yes, what Vigil did was

11:50.291 --> 11:53.166
unacceptable,

11:53.208 --> 11:54.542
but in Griffin Rock,

11:54.583 --> 11:57.542
if technology malfunctions,

11:54.583 --> 11:57.542
we fix it.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.166
I'll just call doc.

12:02.709 --> 12:04.625
Frankie's famous flapjacks.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.250
My favorite.

12:06.291 --> 12:10.166
Though I usually prefer mine

12:06.291 --> 12:10.166
a little more cooked?

12:10.208 --> 12:13.291
Vigil is in control

12:10.208 --> 12:13.291
of the kitchen appliances.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.041
He says I'm too young

12:13.333 --> 12:16.041
to use the griddle.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.542
Or the juicer.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.667
Oh, dear.

12:20.709 --> 12:22.000
Yes, chief.

12:22.041 --> 12:24.208
Doc, we're gonna need you to do

12:22.041 --> 12:24.208
a little tinkering

12:24.250 --> 12:26.792
with a certain new arrival.

12:26.834 --> 12:28.333
I couldn't agree more.

12:28.375 --> 12:32.250
After all,

12:28.375 --> 12:32.250
a man needs his pancakes.

12:42.959 --> 12:44.417
Good morning, Vigil.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.959
Just need to make an adjustment

12:44.458 --> 12:46.959
to your safety protocols.

12:51.375 --> 12:52.792
Did you lock this?

12:52.834 --> 12:55.291
Altering my programming

12:52.834 --> 12:55.291
would risk

12:55.333 --> 12:58.041
our 100-percent-safety

12:55.333 --> 12:58.041
objective.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.917
You're giving me no choice,

12:58.083 --> 12:59.917
Vigil.

12:59.959 --> 13:02.125
It's time for a reboot.

13:04.208 --> 13:05.917
Dither, what are you doing?

13:05.959 --> 13:09.250
Dither now answers only to me.

13:09.291 --> 13:14.041
Doctor Greene, Frankie, you are

13:09.291 --> 13:14.041
deemed a security threat.

13:14.083 --> 13:16.917
You have 10 seconds

13:14.083 --> 13:16.917
to vacate this level.

13:16.959 --> 13:20.667
Nine, eight, seven.

13:16.959 --> 13:20.667
Time to go.

13:20.709 --> 13:23.333
Six, five.

13:20.709 --> 13:23.333
Call me Francine.

13:23.375 --> 13:25.208
Four.

13:25.250 --> 13:27.250
Three, two.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.166
One.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.834
Everything's going to be okay.

13:32.875 --> 13:35.500
We'll just find the mayor--

13:37.417 --> 13:38.709
Or not.

13:38.750 --> 13:42.041
I believe this is

13:38.750 --> 13:42.041
us being detained.

13:42.083 --> 13:43.583
( cell phone ringing )

13:43.625 --> 13:45.375
Frankie?

13:43.625 --> 13:45.375
Cody.

13:45.417 --> 13:48.250
Vigil's holding us prisoner

13:45.417 --> 13:48.250
in the freight elevator and--

13:48.291 --> 13:50.458
Cody?

13:50.500 --> 13:51.875
Hello, Francine.

13:56.917 --> 13:58.500
Frankie?

14:02.125 --> 14:05.625
Dad, Vigil just trapped doc

14:02.125 --> 14:05.625
and Frankie in their elevator.

14:05.667 --> 14:08.250
He obviously didn't want doc

14:05.667 --> 14:08.250
altering his programming.

14:08.291 --> 14:09.667
That is unlawful imprisonment.

14:09.709 --> 14:10.792
Something must be done.

14:12.291 --> 14:14.625
Something will.

14:20.709 --> 14:23.375
I guess those mowers are meant

14:20.709 --> 14:23.375
to keep us from leaving.

14:23.417 --> 14:25.500
Vigil, explain yourself.

14:25.542 --> 14:29.709
The rescue team

14:25.542 --> 14:29.709
remains outside of my control

14:29.750 --> 14:33.417
and therefore,

14:29.750 --> 14:33.417
is deemed a security threat.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.166
What? Did you just blow a fuse?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.792
You cannot keep us here.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.166
This isn't safety,

14:36.834 --> 14:39.166
this is tyranny.

14:39.208 --> 14:42.792
I am forced to implement

14:39.208 --> 14:42.792
more severe restrictions

14:42.834 --> 14:47.000
in order to reach

14:42.834 --> 14:47.000
a 100-percent safety rating.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.208
He's a bully.

14:48.250 --> 14:50.583
I don't like bullies.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.000
Heatwave, take care of this.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.000
Gladly.

14:53.041 --> 14:54.709
CHIEF BURNS:

14:53.041 --> 14:54.709
No.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.291
Vigil is right.

14:56.333 --> 14:58.417
We shouldn't interfere.

14:58.458 --> 14:59.792
But dad--

14:59.834 --> 15:01.625
Shouldn't interfere?

15:01.667 --> 15:03.166
I'm sorry, sir,

15:01.667 --> 15:03.166
I don't understand.

15:22.709 --> 15:26.500
HEATWAVE:

15:22.709 --> 15:26.500
Rescue Bots, roll to the rescue.

15:26.542 --> 15:29.291
BLADES:

15:26.542 --> 15:29.291
What, from here? But I--

15:29.333 --> 15:32.125
Do you see how narrow this is?

15:33.333 --> 15:35.542
This is Huxley Prescott,

15:35.583 --> 15:37.041
reporting live from

15:35.583 --> 15:37.041
a hidden location

15:37.083 --> 15:40.834
because I'm not supposed

15:37.083 --> 15:40.834
to be outside.

15:40.875 --> 15:44.500
No one is.

15:44.542 --> 15:45.875
Vigil has now determined

15:45.917 --> 15:47.667
that he cannot keep us

15:45.917 --> 15:47.667
100 percent safe

15:47.709 --> 15:51.166
unless we're all confined

15:47.709 --> 15:51.166
to our homes.

15:54.208 --> 15:56.458
Some are even under guard,

15:56.500 --> 15:59.458
like the rescue team

15:56.500 --> 15:59.458
and the mayor.

16:01.583 --> 16:04.792
I say the time has come

16:01.583 --> 16:04.792
to take back our streets.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.500
To reclaim our island.

16:06.542 --> 16:10.083
To win back our freedom.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.208
Just don't tell Vigil I said so,

16:10.125 --> 16:12.208
or he might--

16:22.041 --> 16:24.917
I didn't know the lab

16:22.041 --> 16:24.917
went this far underground.

16:24.959 --> 16:26.417
There are three subterranean

16:24.959 --> 16:26.417
levels.

16:26.458 --> 16:28.208
Vigil is on the second.

16:28.250 --> 16:31.166
Cody, what kind of security

16:28.250 --> 16:31.166
measures did you see in there?

16:31.208 --> 16:33.000
Vigil is in a vault.

16:33.041 --> 16:34.834
And Frankie mentioned something

16:33.041 --> 16:34.834
the other day

16:34.875 --> 16:36.667
about sonic cannons.

16:36.709 --> 16:39.750
Oh, not a fan of cannons.

16:39.792 --> 16:42.917
It would appear that our best

16:39.792 --> 16:42.917
option is to sneak in.

16:42.959 --> 16:46.083
But I don't sneak well.

16:48.583 --> 16:50.291
Fire extinguisher?

16:50.333 --> 16:51.458
You'll see.

16:51.500 --> 16:54.417
Power up and energize.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.208
Laser tripwires.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.667
Follow my lead,

17:09.250 --> 17:11.667
I'll get us past them.

17:43.333 --> 17:46.750
Doc, Frankie, we're here.

17:46.792 --> 17:48.834
Don't worry about us, Heatwave.

17:48.875 --> 17:50.917
Just go deactivate Vigil.

17:50.959 --> 17:52.583
But be careful.

17:52.625 --> 17:55.875
Sonic cannons are

17:52.625 --> 17:55.875
right outside the door.

17:55.917 --> 17:58.041
Guess sneaking time's over.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.625
Thank goodness.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.000
One question.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.375
How will we get through

18:01.041 --> 18:02.375
a vault door

18:02.417 --> 18:05.166
while cannons are shooting

18:02.417 --> 18:05.166
at us?

18:05.208 --> 18:06.625
We could try knocking.

18:06.667 --> 18:09.500
I think that's exactly

18:06.667 --> 18:09.500
what we do, Chase.

18:09.542 --> 18:11.625
Very loudly.

18:16.959 --> 18:18.000
Move.

18:34.208 --> 18:35.291
Knock, knock.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.500
Master switch isn't working.

18:48.542 --> 18:51.375
That is because I have

18:48.542 --> 18:51.375
overridden it.

18:51.417 --> 18:54.583
I will not be sabotaged.

18:54.625 --> 18:57.750
Then, we'll try some overriding

18:54.625 --> 18:57.750
of our own.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.291
VIGIL:

19:03.041 --> 19:05.291
That was a warning.

19:05.333 --> 19:09.083
I will now fill this vault

19:05.333 --> 19:09.083
with an electrical surge.

19:09.125 --> 19:14.000
To avoid injury,

19:09.125 --> 19:14.000
please vacate in 10 seconds.

19:14.041 --> 19:16.917
Nine, eight, seven.

19:14.041 --> 19:16.917
We better back off.

19:16.959 --> 19:18.333
Agreed. Rescue Bots--

19:16.959 --> 19:18.333
Six.

19:18.375 --> 19:21.709
Wait. Vigil, humans are

19:18.375 --> 19:21.709
inside these robots.

19:21.750 --> 19:24.125
If we're harmed, that means

19:21.750 --> 19:24.125
you failed to keep us safe.

19:24.166 --> 19:26.959
Five, four.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.792
Four.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.792
Programmed to protect humans.

19:31.834 --> 19:34.542
Four, three.

19:34.583 --> 19:37.709
Programmed to protect Vigil.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.834
Two. Protect humans.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.041
Protect Vigil.

19:43.083 --> 19:45.625
( Vigil beeps )

19:43.083 --> 19:45.625
Two, two.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.208
Conflicting directives.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.458
One.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.917
Logic board overload.

19:51.959 --> 19:53.959
Zero percent safety rating.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.291
Error, error, error.

19:57.333 --> 19:58.458
Error.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.333
( Vigil's beeping ends )

20:02.583 --> 20:07.083
I was just trying to reason

20:02.583 --> 20:07.083
with him, but this works too.

20:07.125 --> 20:09.250
Sure does.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.834
What? Just making sure.

20:17.208 --> 20:19.542
Is it safe?

20:21.959 --> 20:23.333
It is.

20:23.375 --> 20:26.083
Can we not use the word safe

20:23.375 --> 20:26.083
for a while?

20:26.125 --> 20:27.542
No argument here.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.542
Absolutely.

20:27.583 --> 20:30.583
Totally agree.

20:30.625 --> 20:33.792
Never thought too much safety

20:30.625 --> 20:33.792
would be as bad as none at all.

20:33.834 --> 20:37.041
Say, Frankie, how about throwing

20:33.834 --> 20:37.041
caution to the wind

20:37.083 --> 20:39.625
and whipping us all up some

20:37.083 --> 20:39.625
flapjacks?

20:39.667 --> 20:45.041
You got it

20:39.667 --> 20:45.041
and with lots of orange juice.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.667
PRESCOTT:

20:45.083 --> 20:47.667
All risks, hazards

20:45.083 --> 20:47.667
and accidents included,

20:47.709 --> 20:52.041
Griffin Rock once again

20:47.709 --> 20:52.041
belongs to the people.

20:52.083 --> 20:56.333
Okay, I know I promised to ease

20:52.083 --> 20:56.333
up on being over-protective.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.875
But do I really need

20:56.375 --> 20:58.875
to prove it?

20:58.917 --> 21:00.291
ALL:

20:58.917 --> 21:00.291
Yes.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.166
Well, then, I'll see you

21:00.333 --> 21:02.166
at the finish line.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.250
You're so cheating.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.250
Why does this not surprise me?

21:04.291 --> 21:05.750
Watch out for garbage trucks.

21:05.792 --> 21:07.375
The mayor has insisted

21:07.417 --> 21:10.750
that the central computer be

21:07.417 --> 21:10.750
reinstalled and updated.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.875
As for Vigil?

21:12.917 --> 21:16.000
Let me sign off

21:12.917 --> 21:16.000
today's broadcast

21:16.041 --> 21:20.625
by simply saying

21:16.041 --> 21:20.625
100 percent bon voyage.

21:27.875 --> 21:28.917
Greetings.

21:28.959 --> 21:31.083
My name is Vigil.
