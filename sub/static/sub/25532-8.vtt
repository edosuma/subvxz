WEBVTT

00:07.508 --> 00:10.761
And when my big sister, Susan,
was proposed to, he said:

00:10.844 --> 00:14.389
"Father has given me the farm
in my own name.

00:14.473 --> 00:18.185
What do you say, darling pet,
if we get hitched this fall?"

00:18.477 --> 00:20.646
Have you ever heard such a thing?!

00:20.729 --> 00:22.105
That's it?

00:22.189 --> 00:24.524
Anne, he called her "darling pet."

00:24.608 --> 00:27.778
That proposal is about as amorous
as Mr. Phillips doing a roll call.

00:28.779 --> 00:31.323
And Jane says Prissy's convinced
it'll happen any day now.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.953
Prissy, you leave me breathless!

00:36.036 --> 00:39.164
Marry me, or I shall die choking
on my love for you to the end!

00:39.248 --> 00:43.252
My... brother has guaranteed me a position
on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.920
And upon our relocation,

00:45.003 --> 00:47.756
he's promised introductions
to the city's social elite.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.509
Will you have me, my dearest Ruby?

00:51.885 --> 00:52.803
No.

00:53.804 --> 00:57.057
I plan to have several beaus
and be proposed to several times

00:57.140 --> 00:59.977
just to drive Gilbert Blythe mad
before I accept his offer.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.937
Your turn, Anne.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.904
For you... I will build a castle,

01:10.988 --> 01:15.993
with each brick forged in my heart
with the fire of my transcendent love.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.622
Will you accept
this exquisite diamond ring?

01:20.706 --> 01:24.501
My life will only be complete
if you consent to our marriage.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.337
I vow to be a... distinguished

01:27.421 --> 01:30.215
and... and... and worthy husband.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.719
Oh, Good Lord, man, stand up at once.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.513
Sh-she will want for nothing.

01:36.930 --> 01:37.848
Prissy?

01:39.349 --> 01:40.392
What say you?

01:41.101 --> 01:43.478
Yes!

01:52.029 --> 01:53.530
Thank you, Father.

02:39.242 --> 02:42.287
When you go to school and leave me
here whole day with no one to talk to,

02:42.371 --> 02:43.705
I keep myself busy.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.083
If you cook
and the food ain't have no taste,

02:46.166 --> 02:47.709
I chew and swallow.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.254
I've carried this pain, quiet,
into the cold Canadian spring.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.592
You know me, Blythe.
I don't like to complain.

02:56.051 --> 02:59.054
So when I say
lesser men would've cracked by now...

02:59.679 --> 03:01.807
- Then?
- Exactly.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.685
I'm ready. Close the door.

03:06.395 --> 03:07.938
- Uh, no.
- You're right.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.148
Give it a good slam.
I only wanna do this once.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.609
This is a very bad idea.
Go see a doctor.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.694
For a toothache? Just be my friend.

03:15.404 --> 03:18.198
The onliest one I have
in this vast, lonely country.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.538
Nothing like a little peace and quiet.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.003
<i>Whatever are you doing in there?</i>

03:32.087 --> 03:35.424
- It's a surprise! For your trip!
- I don't like surprises.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.803
That's my issue with this whole business.
It's the not knowing I find disconcerting.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.305
That's why you're going to the oculist.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.642
To know! All will be revealed.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.228
Then again, I'm afraid of that too.

03:48.311 --> 03:51.982
So your eyesight isn't what it used to be.
It happens to people your age.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.150
My age?

03:53.233 --> 03:56.778
Some of us manage
to retain more of our girlish youth.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.989
Now, hurry it up.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.241
We're taking the train today,
not a week from now.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.451
Finished!

04:03.452 --> 04:04.995
No peeking.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.997
Pfft. What am I forgetting?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.374
What am I forgetting?

04:09.458 --> 04:10.459
Oh, Anne...

04:10.876 --> 04:13.170
upstairs in the cedar trunk in my closet,

04:13.253 --> 04:15.046
- please fetch my good shawl.
- Will do!

04:15.130 --> 04:17.466
The partner of failed vision.

04:17.548 --> 04:20.260
I'm trying to remember
why I invited you along.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.763
Oh, that's right, I didn't.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.598
Consider me a burr in your sock.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.082
Anne!

04:52.209 --> 04:53.668
Uh... coming!

04:53.752 --> 04:56.546
I can't wait to get away from it all.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.048
Can you imagine?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.425
Tonight I'm gonna be eating a meal
that I didn't cook.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.385
Oh! The mind reels.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.722
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh. Uh, and...

05:06.306 --> 05:07.390
Marilla?

05:08.517 --> 05:10.227
May I use the curry
that Sebastian gave you

05:10.310 --> 05:12.103
for the dinner I'm planning
to cook tonight?

05:12.729 --> 05:14.981
You may cook on top of the stove only.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.317
- You're not to use the oven. Understood?
- Mm-hmm.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.861
I want Green Gables standing
when I come back tomorrow.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.989
Curry? Ha! Let's hope Matthew is standing
when we return.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.075
- What now?
- Oh, let's be away!

05:25.158 --> 05:26.660
Let's be away!

05:26.743 --> 05:29.246
Come along now, Charlottetown awaits.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.872
- Don't be late for school.
- I won't.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.791
- And don't burn down the house.
- I won't.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.376
And don't get up to any mischief!

05:36.753 --> 05:37.837
Bye!

05:41.675 --> 05:43.843
Diana, you're such a dear.

05:43.927 --> 05:47.472
Thank you. Now I have everything I'll need
for the perfect wedding.

05:47.556 --> 05:51.768
- Prissy, do you have a bridal veil?
- I'm going to be wearing my mother's.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.770
It's a tradition in our family.

05:53.853 --> 05:57.190
You should keep this sixpence
and hand it down to your daughters.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.150
What are we buying?

05:59.234 --> 06:02.988
Diana got a genuine sixpence for Prissy,
all the way from London.

06:04.364 --> 06:08.201
I wrote to my cousin two months ago,
as soon as I heard about the engagement.

06:08.285 --> 06:12.038
- I'm just glad it got here in time.
- Something old, something new.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.124
Something borrowed, something blue.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.710
And a silver sixpence in her shoe.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.045
Sounds painful.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.506
Sounds like a magic spell for happiness.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.810
You need to be more careful, bud.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.235
Is it healing alright?

06:43.028 --> 06:44.613
It's getting there. Thanks.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.540
- I've just come for some firewood.
- Well, hurry up, then.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.295
Oh.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.048
- Ugh. Imbecile.
- I'm sorry. I'll get it.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.064
You disgust me.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.149
Be on your way.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.043
Hello. Good morning, sir.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.503
Tooth trouble.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.214
Actually, it's gum trouble
causing the tooth trouble.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.216
I was hoping for some coconut water.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.677
My mum used to give it to me
as a kind of healing.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.429
Maybe a trade ship came in
with some <i>huang lian?</i>

07:51.513 --> 07:53.014
It's Chinese.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.475
I have no idea what you're saying.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.401
You don't like me.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.111
But I see you like money.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.531
- Just sell me some salt to gargle with.
- We're all out.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.705
Sometimes I find bigotry
very inconvenient.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.249
You won't find care anywhere around here.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.543
You should be with your own kind
in the Bog.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.711
The what?

08:23.128 --> 08:25.714
Don't play dumb. You know
what I'm talking about. The slum...

08:26.131 --> 08:28.341
for people like you outside Charlottetown.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.719
People like me?

08:31.136 --> 08:32.136
This true?

08:32.220 --> 08:33.763
Get out of my shop,

08:33.847 --> 08:36.850
go back to where you belong
with the other delinquents and indigents.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.058
Go!

08:39.269 --> 08:42.522
I was just leaving. You have no idea
how happy you've made me.

08:46.234 --> 08:49.070
The area equals one half times

08:49.154 --> 08:51.531
the sum of both bases,

08:51.614 --> 08:54.034
multiplied by the height.

08:56.703 --> 08:57.746
Simple enough.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.581
Begin.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.754
The student who finishes last...

09:07.297 --> 09:10.050
will wish he had stayed home
from school today.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.473
- Sebastian!
- Good morning. Pardon me.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.433
I need to have a word with Gilbert,
please.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.560
I'd thank you to stay in the cloakroom.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.314
Sebastian, what are you doing here?
You look terrible.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.815
You're not welcome here.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.985
He tried to kill me
at the Christmas Pantomime.

09:29.319 --> 09:32.697
If there's any threat in this classroom,
it's you, Billy Andrews.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.240
Return to your lesson.

09:34.324 --> 09:37.327
You never told me about the Bog.
Can I get my own doctor there?

09:39.412 --> 09:42.582
Uh, just... sit down
before you fall down.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.210
Oh... Oh.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.549
I didn't think you'd want to go there.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.594
You have a fever, Bash.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.432
No doctors 'round here for me.
That's what the man said.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.603
Unbelievable.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.231
That... is just...

10:09.818 --> 10:12.445
I know a doctor in Charlottetown.
I'll take you to him right now.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.823
I want to go to the Bog.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.620
Bash, the Bog is just not a place for you.

10:21.246 --> 10:24.749
It's sad and unlawful
and full of poverty and...

10:24.833 --> 10:26.751
People who resemble me.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.048
I'm sorry.

10:34.968 --> 10:35.802
I'll take you.

10:35.885 --> 10:39.055
But first let me bring you
to a doctor that I know can help you.

10:39.556 --> 10:40.974
No time to waste.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.773
Thomas and I had
a sleeper compartment on our honeymoon.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.984
Not that there was much sleeping.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.779
So what you're really saying is
CP Railways is prejudiced?

10:54.863 --> 10:58.283
I'm saying there's no place
on this train for your...

10:58.992 --> 10:59.868
guest.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.619
Isn't that right, Isaac?

11:03.371 --> 11:05.582
On this train,
we put the coloreds to work.

11:07.208 --> 11:11.296
We might find space enough for him
in the back... with the cargo.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.508
I am a passenger.
I'm not going to any back.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.219
This man my guest.
I paid for his ticket and mine.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.345
Is that true?

11:19.429 --> 11:22.140
Sir, unless this train
is legally segregated,

11:22.223 --> 11:24.309
we will be taking
our legally purchased seats!

11:24.392 --> 11:28.229
- Sounds like quite a fuss.
- Why, that's Gilbert and Bash.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.522
...and let us pass.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.816
Oh. Oh... Gilbert.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.110
Sebastian.
I wondered where you'd got to.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.779
I have seats saved for you. This way.

11:38.031 --> 11:42.702
Last call for Charlottetown!
Boarding, Charlottetown!

11:42.994 --> 11:44.954
Good morning, Mrs. Lynde.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.539
Oh, hello, Gilbert.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.042
And, um, uh, and...

11:49.709 --> 11:52.003
Oh, heavens, Sebastian,
what ails you?

11:52.086 --> 11:55.465
Poor manners and a sore tooth.
Many thanks, Miss Marilla.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.719
Sebastian, I must speak.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.848
I insulted you when we first met,

12:03.932 --> 12:06.184
assuming you were the help.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.729
Avonlea has never been home to a...

12:10.939 --> 12:12.231
Uh...

12:13.733 --> 12:15.360
You are the first...

12:17.820 --> 12:19.155
Well...

12:19.948 --> 12:23.493
All that to say
you must come to tea someday soon.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.414
You too, Gilbert.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.753
Thank you. I appreciate the apology,
and the invitation.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.549
Disgusting.

12:53.982 --> 12:57.110
I haven't been on a train
since my father and I traveled west.

12:57.193 --> 13:01.280
Was it difficult?
Traveling with John in such poor health?

13:02.240 --> 13:03.700
He loved every minute of it.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.704
I'm taking Bash to his doctor, actually.

13:07.787 --> 13:08.913
I guess Anne didn't tell you,

13:08.997 --> 13:11.249
but I-I'm looking to pursue a career
in medicine.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.127
My, won't that be wonderful.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.629
Finally, a doctor in Avonlea.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.634
Your father would be very proud.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.928
He'd be glad I'm back home, anyway.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.221
Me?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.015
I'm not so sure.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.810
Returning to a one-room schoolhouse
with an apathetic teacher

13:30.893 --> 13:33.146
might not have been my smartest move.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.732
Mr. Phillips will be moving on
after the wedding.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.152
I hope whoever they get next
will actually be interested in teaching.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.656
Ah, yes, my surprise.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.575
I forgot all about it.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.202
It's pretty.
That must be from Anne.

13:48.286 --> 13:51.664
I wonder which aspiration,
from her many passions,

13:52.290 --> 13:54.667
Anne will choose when the time comes.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.839
Anne Shirley-Cuthbert
is a passionate individual, alright.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.846
Oh, thank you.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.813
The trousseau of an unmarried woman,

14:15.897 --> 14:18.274
is it an exquisitely preserved memento
of her youth,

14:18.357 --> 14:20.735
or a tragical reminder
of a life she'll never know?

14:20.818 --> 14:22.403
Tell us when you're an old maid.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.947
Do orphans even have trousseaus?

14:25.031 --> 14:27.367
- Anne has parents now, Josie.
- Not by blood.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.411
My actual mother
started mine when I was born,

14:30.495 --> 14:32.330
just like my grandmother did for her.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.582
When I lost mine in the fire, I...

14:35.166 --> 14:38.419
But Gran and Mother and I
have been sewing nonstop to restore it.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.047
- I'll help you, Anne.
- We all will.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.801
Off the top of my head,
I'd love to acquire the collected works

14:44.884 --> 14:47.637
of the Bronte sisters
and Shakespeare and Mary Shelley...

14:47.720 --> 14:50.890
No, Anne, it must be things
like petticoats and linens.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.435
I've already monogrammed
several kerchiefs with the initials G.B.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.355
Such antiquated rules.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.482
What if I don't want
to acquire those things?

14:59.565 --> 15:02.652
Can't I choose what I want
to enter into <i>my</i> new life with?

15:02.735 --> 15:05.905
A bride has a trousseau
so that she can have pretty things

15:05.988 --> 15:08.366
and be a beautiful wife to her husband,
Anne.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.909
You can't change that.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.749
Sorry to intrude, my lovebird.

15:17.875 --> 15:21.170
Don't think I'll stop calling you that,
even after we're married.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.923
Although I'll love
calling you husband, too.

15:24.674 --> 15:28.010
I promise to find a way
to balance college and marriage.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.639
You won't be neglected.

15:33.933 --> 15:34.851
Sweet Prissy.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.523
I've been thinking
about it these past two months.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.569
And after we're married, I'm gonna need
your full devotion as my wife.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.363
We can't social-climb
if you're locked away at school.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.159
It's a wife's duty.

15:53.744 --> 15:54.704
Isn't it?

15:59.083 --> 16:00.042
Of course.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.471
<i>Why does he get to decide?</i>

16:11.554 --> 16:14.223
Hey! You have no right!

16:15.850 --> 16:17.393
Stop!

16:17.977 --> 16:19.187
What is this?

16:19.270 --> 16:20.480
Just give it back.

16:20.563 --> 16:21.606
Sure.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.857
Catch.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.071
Mr. Andrews, that's enough!

16:36.204 --> 16:38.539
To whom does this belong?

16:41.417 --> 16:42.960
It's mine, sir.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.555
Then your parents
can pay for a new window.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.599
That's not fair!
Billy threw it at him!

16:56.682 --> 16:59.018
I'm speaking to Mr. Mackenzie!

17:01.103 --> 17:01.938
Well?

17:03.231 --> 17:05.358
Why don't you tell the truth for once?

17:07.777 --> 17:09.945
I was just... doing what you told me to.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.949
I was giving it back.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.166
My parents can't afford that.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.546
Then we'll have to punish you
in some other way.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.520
- Open your hand.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.565
You are the most disruptive student
in this classroom.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.988
That... is your perception,

17:52.071 --> 17:54.282
but it is not fact.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.826
If you want to hate someone...

17:57.702 --> 17:59.328
you should look in the mirror.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.584
Open... your... hand.

18:05.710 --> 18:06.711
No.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.404
F... C... Z...

18:34.363 --> 18:35.323
P?

18:36.490 --> 18:39.327
Your eyesight's not as strong
as I would like.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.705
Due to age, I hope.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.670
And I do read
and sew a lot by firelight.

18:49.754 --> 18:53.674
I'm concerned about your headaches
and the vision impairment you described.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.135
It's possible that eye strain
could be the cause,

18:56.218 --> 18:58.721
so I'm gonna give you
some reading glasses to try.

18:58.804 --> 19:02.016
And I want you to amend your diet
before I see you again.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.435
- See me again?
- In three months.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.355
In the meantime,
eat foods that promote eye health...

19:07.438 --> 19:11.067
lots of fish, carrots... and be sure
you have good light to read by.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.778
Is there something else
that may be the cause?

19:13.861 --> 19:15.404
Something worse?

19:15.488 --> 19:18.157
I'm not going to make a formal diagnosis
right now.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.785
Just follow my instructions
and I'll see you soon.

19:22.578 --> 19:26.165
Gilbert Blythe!

19:26.999 --> 19:29.085
- It's been awhile.
- It has.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.712
I was very sorry
to hear about your father.

19:31.796 --> 19:35.216
- Who do you have with you?
- This is my friend, Sebastian.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.760
- It's an emergency.
- Yes, yes, I can see that.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.136
It's Blythe that needs help.

19:39.220 --> 19:42.390
Cure him of thinking he knows
what's good for everybody else.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.934
That's a sentiment
I've heard in this office before.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.353
Open up, let me see it.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.898
It's criminal.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.609
Blame him.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.152
I was coerced.

19:55.236 --> 19:58.406
My judgment was impaired
by my need for silence.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.243
You have a fever from the infection.
I can give you something for both.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.704
You're going to have to have some sutures.

20:04.787 --> 20:07.206
Sorry to be rude, but I can't stay.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.542
They must have doctors
who can help me in the Bog.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.419
The only person who can help you
in the Bog

20:11.502 --> 20:14.130
is a barber who pulls teeth
with rusty tongs.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.258
Blythe, new plan.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.927
I'll get fixed up here
and then we go to the Bog.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.517
Blythe?

20:41.282 --> 20:43.117
I came as soon as we were dismissed.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.703
Not that anyone did any schoolwork
after you left.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.164
Mr. Phillips shut himself away
in the supply room.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.040
He wouldn't even open the door to Prissy.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.418
I'm never going back.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.797
Why do you think
Mr. Phillips hates you so?

21:03.429 --> 21:05.681
He wanted to hurt me today...

21:05.973 --> 21:08.058
because he couldn't punish himself.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.604
For being like me.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.856
Like you?

21:15.232 --> 21:16.400
I'm...

21:16.776 --> 21:19.487
the same as Josephine Barry.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.657
But with boys.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.248
Thank you for sharing that with me.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.712
I think Mr. Phillips is too,

21:36.796 --> 21:38.297
but he doesn't want to be.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.007
So he's marrying Prissy...

21:41.592 --> 21:43.469
Life is very complicated.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.764
Then again, it's very simple.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.976
Love who you love and be with them.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.688
- It's against the law to be like me.
- The law is wrong.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.651
I've just had the most brilliant idea.

21:59.318 --> 22:03.739
If the time comes and we haven't found
our romantical kindred spirits,

22:03.823 --> 22:06.951
I propose that we propose to each other.

22:07.034 --> 22:10.412
You'll be an artist,
in all the ways of your choosing,

22:10.496 --> 22:12.289
and I'll be...

22:12.790 --> 22:14.875
I'll be something that thrills me, too.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.752
A union of equals.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.630
Individuals together.

22:21.799 --> 22:24.385
Free spirits living our true lives.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.432
Oh!

22:30.516 --> 22:33.060
I'm not convinced medicine
is for you, Blythe.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.355
- What happened?
- You fainted.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.107
You want to be a doctor, eh?

22:38.190 --> 22:40.109
- You sure? It's never pretty.
- Yeah.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.278
He has a knack for it.
Most of the time.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.196
Well, this is exciting news.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.700
Nowadays his nose is always in a book.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.493
Ready, Blythe?

22:52.621 --> 22:54.039
Dr. Ward?

22:54.123 --> 22:55.499
Do you need an apprentice?

22:55.583 --> 22:59.545
Maybe I could help around here
every now and again and, in exchange,

22:59.628 --> 23:04.049
you could help me craft my study plan?
I promise I won't keep fainting.

23:04.133 --> 23:06.927
It would be my privilege to mentor you.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.597
I've been thinking I might like
to share my practice someday.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.307
Ah. Settled.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.267
Let's go to the Bog.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.811
I've never seen anyone
in such a hurry to get to a slum.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.313
I imagine it's a beautiful place

23:17.396 --> 23:19.607
where black people
dance beautifully in the snow.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.901
He's fine. Just a little laudanum.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.154
Oh. What do I owe you, Doctor?

23:25.487 --> 23:28.157
No charge,
if Gilbert will clean up around here.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.244
I've got some time before my next patient
if you'd like to start our discussion too.

23:34.872 --> 23:38.542
- Could you meet me back here in an hour?
- You can come and fetch me.

23:38.626 --> 23:41.629
If you can find me.
I'm going to blend in.

23:47.635 --> 23:52.097
Ah, this little vacation
is absolutely invigorating.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.768
Reading glasses. Are you relieved?

23:56.310 --> 23:59.563
A certain optimist I know
was worried about much worse.

23:59.647 --> 24:03.275
- I'm just an old woman.
- Buck up.

24:03.359 --> 24:06.195
We're the ones chasing old age,
not the other way around.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.073
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.327
Rachel Lynde! Did you wink?

24:13.410 --> 24:16.580
- Go on, try it.
- Absolutely not!

24:16.664 --> 24:17.665
Keeps you young.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.339
All this after ten children.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.467
Marilla, isn't that your brooch?

24:32.304 --> 24:36.558
Oh. How could I have allowed our family
heirlooms to end up in such a place?

24:36.642 --> 24:39.186
Now, now, you did what was needed
to pay the bank.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.524
That's Matthew's pocket watch.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.484
It belonged to Michael before him.

24:46.694 --> 24:49.905
Our family legacies scattered on the wind.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.702
I don't have much, but maybe...

25:00.499 --> 25:02.501
I don't mind a simple supper.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.299
Anne said the pawnbroker's
a powerful negotiator.

25:09.383 --> 25:12.010
There's still some fight
in these old girls yet.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.764
- Let's go in.
- You first.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.732
Hello there.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.859
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.527
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

25:37.745 --> 25:39.538
Hello. Good afternoon.

25:40.164 --> 25:41.290
Good afternoon.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.169
If it isn't the man from the train.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.383
So your guest ditched you?

25:54.261 --> 25:56.472
- Where you from?
- Trinidad.

25:56.555 --> 25:57.973
I worked a steamship to get here.

25:58.056 --> 26:01.894
I mean where do you live when you're not
slumming down here with us...

26:01.977 --> 26:03.061
in the muck?

26:03.145 --> 26:04.980
Avonlea.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.943
Farming community.
Hear it's pretty up there.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.820
Must be nice.

26:13.822 --> 26:17.993
I was rounding off a 72-hour shift
when you got all uppity.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.370
Boss rode me till the end like a mule.

26:20.454 --> 26:23.916
Sounds like you had it bad
before I stepped foot on that train.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.668
Pushing me to the back
wasn't bound to help you.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.212
Boy...

26:28.295 --> 26:31.924
it's alright for you
to be those people's pet,

26:32.007 --> 26:33.801
but you don't know your place,

26:34.426 --> 26:35.719
and that's dangerous.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.472
What I can't understand, boy,

26:38.555 --> 26:41.517
is someone who was born free,
but still likes the taste

26:41.600 --> 26:44.478
of the boss man's boot enough to lick it
when he doesn't have to.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.107
A steamer's just a floating train!

26:49.191 --> 26:51.151
You licked your share of boots to survive!

27:09.461 --> 27:11.463
Now, I coulda hit you in the mouth.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.636
Laundry's a few streets that way.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.556
They'll take care of you.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.089
It's so beautiful.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.927
- Why are you crying?
- Oh, Prissy, I...

27:59.011 --> 28:00.512
I had such hopes for you.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.016
More so than for myself.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.895
I wanted you... to live a full life.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.773
But I'm... getting married.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.025
And giving up college.

28:14.776 --> 28:18.030
You were supposed to start a new tradition
of educated wives

28:18.113 --> 28:19.615
who think for themselves.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.158
I can still go someday.

28:21.241 --> 28:22.784
I'm sure I will.

28:24.453 --> 28:25.662
Of course I will.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.915
Prissy, it's not too late.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.337
I'm not a child.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.047
I know what I want!

29:17.089 --> 29:18.799
There's a good-looking man outside!

29:18.882 --> 29:20.926
Oh, yeah?
Then why's he making us wait?

29:21.009 --> 29:22.261
He's smart.

29:22.344 --> 29:25.931
If a bunch of women were talking about me,
I wouldn't come in without an invitation.

29:34.648 --> 29:37.651
- Afternoon, ladies. I have to be honest...
- I hope so.

29:37.734 --> 29:41.029
The last man who tried to rob us
left here with less than he came in with.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.119
My situation
might be a bit of a challenge.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.705
Well, bring your challenge inside
and close the door.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.085
Ooh, hot in here!

29:55.168 --> 29:57.421
Feels just like a perfect Carnival Monday.

29:57.504 --> 30:01.008
If I didn't have to smell him,
I could listen to him talk all day.

30:01.091 --> 30:04.303
Lucky you got a warm place to be in
in this bone-chilling winter.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.347
I'm lucky?

30:07.431 --> 30:08.432
Yes?

30:08.515 --> 30:12.060
I'm lucky to be working here all day,
hunched over this tub,

30:12.144 --> 30:16.315
cleaning dirt and worse out
of peoples' foul-smelling underthings?

30:16.398 --> 30:18.108
Now that you put it like that...

30:18.191 --> 30:20.569
Nickel per item,
press and starch included.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.739
I hope you don't mind me sayin' so,
Miss, but you're very pretty.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.700
- Like a Julie mango shining in the sun.
- Mm-hmm.

30:26.783 --> 30:29.369
I do mind.
Why is it that men think

30:29.453 --> 30:32.039
women are waiting around
to be complimented? I'm working.

30:33.457 --> 30:35.167
S-sorry. I used to be good at this.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.878
Good at what? Dropping off your laundry?

30:39.338 --> 30:41.381
Talking to ladies.
Must be out of practice.

30:41.465 --> 30:42.591
Must be.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.761
March in here
with your mango this, lucky that?

30:45.844 --> 30:48.597
I'm sorry, for a moment
you made me forget all my troubles.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.848
Mm.

30:52.726 --> 30:53.810
Well...

30:54.936 --> 30:56.521
let's have your things.

30:58.815 --> 31:01.777
Come on now. You don't have anything
Jocelyn hasn't seen before.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.154
I don't mind seeing it again.

31:11.578 --> 31:14.206
- Wool pants?!
- I'm not so good with the cold.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.124
Give 'em up.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.292
Oh, Lord!

31:18.085 --> 31:20.504
I've been looking
all over for you.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.130
What happened?

31:22.214 --> 31:24.883
Why are you standing
half-naked in a room full of women?

31:25.592 --> 31:27.552
Fortune finally smiled on me.

31:28.095 --> 31:31.390
Ladies, this is my friend
and business partner, Gilbert Blythe.

31:32.099 --> 31:33.850
Forgive me. Pardon me.

31:36.937 --> 31:39.147
- And you are?
- Name is Sebastian.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.651
You can call me Bash, Bastian, Trini.
Whatever you like.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.695
Turns out there's no train
until tomorrow,

31:45.779 --> 31:48.323
so we'll need to find a hotel.
Can you recommend one?

31:48.407 --> 31:51.243
Caters to black folks? Good luck.

31:52.369 --> 31:55.664
I know someone... who has a room.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.917
She... lets it out to people in need.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.001
Mm-hmm.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.924
These were never claimed.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.302
I wonder why not.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.012
Best I can offer.

32:12.139 --> 32:15.016
What is this someone's name
who takes in wayward travelers?

32:16.101 --> 32:17.144
Mary.

32:21.356 --> 32:24.776
<i>Remember when I wanted
to be a bride but not a wife?</i>

32:25.277 --> 32:28.447
You said that... the day we met.

32:28.530 --> 32:31.658
I think I need to re-imagine
the whole marriage/wedding thing.

32:31.741 --> 32:32.868
How so?

32:32.951 --> 32:35.704
It isn't about just one brief,
shining moment in white,

32:35.787 --> 32:37.080
or saying I do.

32:37.164 --> 32:39.416
And I'm not gonna give myself
over to someone

32:39.499 --> 32:43.378
and be a prettyish piece of property
without a voice or ambition.

32:44.421 --> 32:48.467
We will be equals and partners,
not just husband and wife.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.720
And neither one should have to abandon
their heart's desire.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.306
I've come up with a new name
for both parties, together,

32:54.389 --> 32:55.432
because I believe...

32:55.515 --> 32:57.142
that they should be named the same.

32:58.059 --> 33:00.604
Well... let's hear it.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.189
Life mate.

33:02.898 --> 33:05.692
Ah, that's a new one for the dictionary!

33:05.775 --> 33:08.320
Instead of a marriage,
I shall call it a love bond.

33:08.403 --> 33:11.698
- And any two people can have one.
- Yeah? Think it's ready?

33:12.324 --> 33:15.619
I think Marilla might be cross.
She forbade any proximity to the oven.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.163
Well, you're no longer in proximity
to the oven.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.873
- Whoo!
- I am!

33:19.956 --> 33:21.416
Ahem.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.084
- Mm.
- Whoa!

33:25.754 --> 33:27.422
Oh, it smells divine!

33:27.506 --> 33:29.007
Stand back.

33:29.090 --> 33:33.094
It's a hot supper brought to you
with very little

33:33.178 --> 33:35.430
disobedience coming through.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.849
Ah...

33:43.438 --> 33:45.148
To life mates.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.442
I'll drink to that.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.027
Mm!

34:08.880 --> 34:10.297
I take you,

34:10.382 --> 34:12.175
matched to my intellect,

34:12.259 --> 34:14.302
proponent of my happiness,

34:14.386 --> 34:16.054
friend of my heart,

34:16.137 --> 34:17.931
to be my life mate.

34:18.014 --> 34:21.434
Let us dance together
as equal partners through the years.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.543
How are you two? Not still hungry?

35:28.627 --> 35:30.045
Oh. Or fragrant.

35:30.128 --> 35:34.633
- Bless you for drawing him a bath.
- Yes, bless you, Mary. You're an angel.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.218
I brought your receipt.

35:48.897 --> 35:49.731
Oh.

35:50.607 --> 35:52.192
You gave me too much.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.152
I was hoping for some breakfast?

35:56.279 --> 35:58.406
I do know how to cook, don't I?

36:00.909 --> 36:02.160
Good night, then.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.710
"Bless you, my angel."

36:10.794 --> 36:13.588
Tease all you like.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.300
I don't shy away from the truth
of how I feel like some fellows I know.

36:17.384 --> 36:19.594
Ah...

36:25.016 --> 36:26.810
I don't think I'll sleep much.

36:28.144 --> 36:30.313
Too much has happened today.

36:30.397 --> 36:32.524
I know exactly what you mean.

36:56.297 --> 36:58.133
I only meant to try it on.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.136
I was... curious about your trousseau.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.638
But I-I'm sure it can be mended.

37:05.432 --> 37:08.476
Marilla, it was a terrible accident,
but I did a wicked thing,

37:08.560 --> 37:12.439
and I'm ready to receive
your severe yet just punishment.

37:14.065 --> 37:17.235
I'm very proud of you for coming to me
straightaway with the truth.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.574
This veil was to be mine
and then my daughter's.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.244
It belongs to you now, Anne.

37:26.327 --> 37:28.913
Most everything in that trunk
should be yours.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.337
What did the oculist say?

37:38.006 --> 37:39.257
Oh.

37:39.632 --> 37:42.761
With any luck,
I'll get to see you as a bride one day.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.932
I have something else for you.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.857
Your brooch!

37:55.940 --> 37:57.400
You reclaimed it.

37:57.484 --> 37:59.694
I am bequeathing it to you.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.030
This too will be yours someday.

38:02.906 --> 38:07.452
And later, it will be your gift
to bestow on someone you love.

38:07.535 --> 38:12.040
I don't know which I love more,
the word "bequeath" or the brooch.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.513
Oh, is it time for tea?

38:27.305 --> 38:29.432
Why don't you see for yourself?

38:32.310 --> 38:34.729
I never thought I'd see this again.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.732
That pawnbroker
was a nasty bit of business.

38:38.525 --> 38:40.819
It paid to bring Anne home.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.321
And that's what counts.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.156
What do you mean?

38:45.949 --> 38:48.993
- Didn't Anne sell it with all our things?
- I sold it.

38:49.702 --> 38:52.163
For train fare to fetch Anne after the...

38:52.622 --> 38:53.540
misunderstanding.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.417
And I'd do it again.

39:08.555 --> 39:09.806
<i>Something old...</i>

39:10.974 --> 39:12.600
Something new...

39:12.684 --> 39:14.477
Something borrowed?

39:15.603 --> 39:16.771
Something blue?

39:16.855 --> 39:19.107
And a silver sixpence...

39:19.190 --> 39:20.900
In... my shoe.

39:20.984 --> 39:24.571
Prissy, I can only hope that one day,

39:24.654 --> 39:27.115
eventually,
this union between you and Mr. Phillips

39:27.198 --> 39:30.702
will grow into one where you can both
fulfill your heart's desires.

39:33.746 --> 39:37.542
Oh, well, I-I only meant that even if
your marriage isn't all romantical,

39:37.625 --> 39:39.961
you can still have
the most marvelous life in Toronto,

39:40.044 --> 39:43.381
and perhaps one day,
you can go back to... school.

39:50.013 --> 39:52.891
- We'll leave you to it.
- I'll see you out.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.346
Do you remember how quickly we sped
through our wedding vows?

40:31.429 --> 40:32.680
Mm-hmm.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.099
They stood between us
and our honeymoon.

40:35.183 --> 40:38.269
- I never spoke so fast in my life.
- Shhh.

40:39.270 --> 40:42.523
This is such a pretty little venue.
Minnie May, stop that at once!

41:48.798 --> 41:50.508
Prissy?

41:55.054 --> 41:56.139
Prissy?

42:03.146 --> 42:05.189
Prissy?
