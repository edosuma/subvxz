WEBVTT

02:05.480 --> 02:07.005
Dad, I've got to go!

02:09.520 --> 02:11.329
Man, I've got to go!

02:23.520 --> 02:25.841
I've got somewhere to be, Dad!

03:04.440 --> 03:06.044
They're fucking in there.

03:11.920 --> 03:12.887
Who?

03:14.200 --> 03:15.326
Sarah and Paul.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.124
I shouldn't let anyone in.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.169
I don't like strawberry.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.445
It's raspberry.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.441
Since when have they been fucking?

04:01.560 --> 04:03.767
You fancy him or something?

04:26.840 --> 04:29.161
You're such a loser, Paul.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.128
What are you doing here?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.525
We were meant to meet up.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.130
What are you thinking?

05:33.960 --> 05:37.282
Your eyes are like pirates
looking out to sea.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.170
Shit.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.603
You take it so seriously.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.365
What?

06:02.880 --> 06:05.451
I thought we'd get the guys
a bit warmed up.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.565
Yeah, right.

06:29.200 --> 06:32.090
Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!

06:32.960 --> 06:34.485
Hot!

06:36.560 --> 06:38.483
Man, that's hot! Look at this!

06:38.800 --> 06:40.882
Check this scorcher out, mate!

08:36.799 --> 08:38.325
No girls.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.002
I said, no girls.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.482
You mind if I fill this up?

09:42.760 --> 09:44.330
Hold this for me?

09:51.360 --> 09:53.488
Nice porn collection you got there.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.843
I sit in the lorry all day,
I've got so much time.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.401
You have your own lorry?
- Nah.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.204
It's Mum's.

10:08.960 --> 10:12.123
Can I drive it sometime?
- Forget it.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.209
Nobody drives it drunk.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.331
Except me.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.049
Can I come along sometime?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.126
What?

10:24.280 --> 10:25.770
You mean now?

10:25.960 --> 10:27.086
Yeah.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.248
Give me a little ride around town.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.330
If you dance for me.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.283
Right then, a spin around town.

11:22.360 --> 11:24.362
And? First time in a lorry, eh?

11:25.400 --> 11:26.686
You like it?

11:59.760 --> 12:01.649
What about that dance?

13:32.920 --> 13:34.843
Whoever laughs first has to drink.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.451
Watch this.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.526
Yeah, there, you lose.
- No!

13:49.680 --> 13:51.682
No!
- Take a sip.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.531
Another one.

13:59.720 --> 14:00.846
Watch this.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.326
One, two, three.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.480
You lose.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.122
Come on, you can do it.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.004
Watch this. Come on now.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.684
That was quick.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.206
Here, drink!

14:34.840 --> 14:37.764
So, will you grant a kiss
to an old geezer like me?

14:37.960 --> 14:38.882
No.

14:39.080 --> 14:42.482
It's just a kiss, that's all.
Come on. - OK.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.168
Hey, what was that?

14:45.360 --> 14:48.091
I'm not your granddad!
- But you could be.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.163
You're a mean one!

14:52.720 --> 14:54.449
How old am I then?
How old is your grandpa?

14:54.640 --> 14:57.484
A hundred.
- And I'm a hundred then?

14:58.920 --> 15:00.684
You're so pretty.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.683
Come on, turn around.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.406
And do you still drink coffee?

17:19.359 --> 17:20.599
No, I can't.

17:21.599 --> 17:24.968
Because of my heart.
I can't anymore.

21:41.360 --> 21:44.170
OK, your father will take you there.

21:44.360 --> 21:45.361
Right?

21:45.560 --> 21:46.641
Yeah.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.766
What happened to you... it's...

21:56.160 --> 21:57.400
Excuse me.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.005
Can I go?

22:10.200 --> 22:13.283
Then you have to sign here
that you decided

22:13.480 --> 22:16.404
to be transferred
into a psychiatric clinic.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.970
Take care.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.725
Do you smell the ocean?

23:20.160 --> 23:22.401
I haven't worn that for years, Dad.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.489
Your mother knew things like that.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.850
Thanks, Dad.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.851
I don't understand what's up
all of a sudden.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.964
Do you want to know?

26:00.960 --> 26:02.200
For you.

26:04.960 --> 26:05.927
No thanks.

26:10.080 --> 26:14.210
There's caramel cream in it,
and roasted nuts.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.809
Take it, please.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.411
Sophie!

26:26.840 --> 26:29.730
Never eat what she offers you.

26:30.520 --> 26:31.885
Come with me.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.804
We have 15 rooms
and 27 patients at present.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.162
Most stay for several years.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.442
But some just stay for a short time.

26:52.640 --> 26:55.484
Going through a regimented daily therapy

26:55.680 --> 26:57.569
is sometimes sufficient.

27:10.240 --> 27:13.244
The lady you're sharing a room with,
her name is Ann.

27:19.120 --> 27:20.884
You should just relax for a bit now.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.082
It's dinnertime in half an hour.

28:31.600 --> 28:32.931
Are you coming?

28:33.120 --> 28:34.884
We want to close up.

30:55.160 --> 30:58.721
Amber is often stuck
under a piece of seaweed.

30:59.760 --> 31:01.444
Or under a shell.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.962
Come, let me show you something.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.724
Where are we going?

32:30.560 --> 32:32.164
Come find out.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.363
Isn't there an alarm system here?

34:07.800 --> 34:09.245
Come in.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.126
Come on!

34:33.760 --> 34:35.444
Want to dive with me?

34:40.040 --> 34:41.371
OK.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.408
Close your eyes.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.324
You see?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.207
It can happen to anyone.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.286
Are you cold?

41:03.320 --> 41:04.560
Yes, love?

41:04.760 --> 41:07.764
Mum, Nikita taught me something.
- What's that?

41:07.960 --> 41:10.167
Roses are red, violets are blue,

41:10.360 --> 41:12.203
Dad's a silly fool
and Mum's a big old mule!

41:12.400 --> 41:13.606
What?

41:13.800 --> 41:16.610
And you're a naughty little stinker!

41:17.360 --> 41:19.124
And you have stinky feet.

41:19.320 --> 41:20.731
Sorry?

41:20.920 --> 41:24.891
Who's the stinkiest little stinker
in the world?

41:25.920 --> 41:28.685
Aren't you a little stinker!

41:29.000 --> 41:30.331
No, you are, Mummy!

41:35.400 --> 41:37.129
Not on my hair. That hurts.

41:37.320 --> 41:38.845
Lilly, not on the hair.

41:39.040 --> 41:39.768
Let go.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.044
Lilly, that hurts!

41:42.240 --> 41:44.083
Lilly, let go! That hurts!

41:59.720 --> 42:01.563
Does it still hurt?

42:13.120 --> 42:15.600
But you said you'd have it pulled!

42:20.560 --> 42:21.721
Now!

42:23.480 --> 42:25.448
I can't.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.689
Come on, do it!

42:32.000 --> 42:33.604
Do it for me!

42:41.720 --> 42:43.131
Shit!

42:44.120 --> 42:45.770
It's out.

42:52.640 --> 42:54.688
Sweet dreams of sour pickles.

43:18.240 --> 43:19.401
Ole?

43:27.680 --> 43:29.967
Can you get that please?

43:44.760 --> 43:46.285
Sis!

43:47.120 --> 43:48.485
What's wrong?

43:48.680 --> 43:50.762
Happy birthday.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.762
Come on in.

44:05.640 --> 44:07.927
Have a seat in the kitchen.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.602
He might still call.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.968
Even you don't believe that.

44:42.040 --> 44:43.246
Can you get that please?

44:47.080 --> 44:49.242
You see what I look like.

44:59.720 --> 45:01.290
Just a moment!

45:03.080 --> 45:04.047
Yeah!

45:04.880 --> 45:07.008
Hey, you're early.
- Hello!

45:07.200 --> 45:08.440
Hello there.

45:09.160 --> 45:12.528
Where is the birthday girl?
- She's getting ready.

45:12.720 --> 45:13.960
How are you? Hi.

45:15.960 --> 45:17.325
Nice that you came.

45:17.520 --> 45:20.171
Man, you really
got yourself all prettied up.

45:21.200 --> 45:22.645
Is Ole here?

45:22.840 --> 45:24.922
Yeah, he's in...
- Ole!

45:28.240 --> 45:29.480
Stine?

45:36.360 --> 45:38.203
May I come in?

46:11.240 --> 46:13.049
Want some more?
- Yeah, sure.

46:14.040 --> 46:14.768
Thank you.

46:14.960 --> 46:17.850
I'd rather have a schnapps.
- I'll get you one.

46:18.040 --> 46:20.168
Would you like some more?
-A beer would be great.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.771
Beer. Be right back.

46:21.960 --> 46:23.530
Just a moment.
-Thanks.

46:26.360 --> 46:28.328
Are you thirsty? Want a drink?
- Thanks.

46:28.520 --> 46:30.363
Wow, you in a dress...

46:30.560 --> 46:32.449
Well, for the occasion...

46:32.640 --> 46:34.051
Want a bit?
- Where's Lilly?

46:34.240 --> 46:35.526
She's already sleeping.

46:35.720 --> 46:37.848
You're up late.

46:40.960 --> 46:42.325
Frenja!

46:43.400 --> 46:45.084
You forgot us.

46:45.520 --> 46:47.090
Are you gonna play?

46:47.280 --> 46:49.009
Come on, you'll play, right?

46:50.280 --> 46:52.647
What about the food?
- Your guests are hungry.

46:52.840 --> 46:54.205
The buffet is...

48:11.720 --> 48:14.121
Are you nervous?
- A bit.

48:14.320 --> 48:15.731
Is it any better?

48:22.600 --> 48:23.886
Frenja!

48:25.320 --> 48:26.924
You can do it.

48:51.720 --> 48:54.371
Today I wanted to tell you the story

48:55.440 --> 48:59.047
about the day I turned 13 or 14,

49:00.440 --> 49:03.808
and we were together on holiday.
Do you remember?

49:04.720 --> 49:07.690
And... I absolutely wanted
to go to the beach alone,

49:07.880 --> 49:09.962
because all the guys were there.

49:10.200 --> 49:14.205
And our parents sent little Frenja
with me as chaperone.

49:14.400 --> 49:16.846
Because they knew
I was a naughty little one.

49:21.520 --> 49:25.923
But then I stepped on a wasp
and of course screamed bloody murder.

49:26.880 --> 49:29.008
That was the start of my opera career.

49:30.760 --> 49:32.649
And what did Frenja do?

49:33.640 --> 49:35.404
She put me in a handcart

49:35.600 --> 49:40.527
and pulled me all the way home
from the beach.

49:40.840 --> 49:42.763
And she did it so well

49:43.680 --> 49:46.047
that I was alright at the end of the ride.

49:47.200 --> 49:49.806
But Frenja was so exhausted

49:52.680 --> 49:56.241
that she broke down and didn't
come out again the whole holiday.

49:56.440 --> 50:00.604
And I just wanted to say that
for all these years I've been so sorry.

50:02.920 --> 50:06.049
So today I'd like to raise a glass

50:07.560 --> 50:09.801
to our Frenja

50:10.000 --> 50:11.923
and her enormous heart.

50:14.040 --> 50:16.407
Right, Ole? That's a toast.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.648
The buffet is open.

50:31.120 --> 50:33.930
Do you have a bit more wine for us?

50:34.120 --> 50:36.441
It's really delicious.
- Of course.

54:43.280 --> 54:45.681
Mummy, I can't sleep.

54:53.920 --> 54:56.605
Mummy, you smell like sick.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.723
Hello.
- Hi.

57:10.880 --> 57:12.484
Should we turn them over?

57:29.760 --> 57:31.250
Thanks.

57:31.440 --> 57:32.965
I'm Frenja.

57:34.440 --> 57:35.680
Leila.

58:45.120 --> 58:46.565
What's wrong?

58:46.760 --> 58:48.250
Ann's gone.

59:01.760 --> 59:05.128
Why is it so bad,
that she's not in her bed?

59:09.320 --> 59:10.970
Where were you?

59:11.640 --> 59:13.404
I couldn't sleep.

59:16.200 --> 59:18.282
I've got something to smoke.

59:18.480 --> 59:19.811
Come on.

59:41.160 --> 59:42.730
Where did you get that, anyway?

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.450
Whoa, I'm so dizzy.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.531
Does she look like you?

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.765
I don't know.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.928
She looks like...

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.850
Lilly.

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.649
It was always like that.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.361
She wasn't my daughter

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.403
or a part of Ole and me.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.651
She was always just Lilly.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.088
She's got a scar here.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.529
From a heart operation.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.127
She got teased about it at school.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.168
But you know what she says?

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.723
It's not a scar.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.969
It's a zipper.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.007
And when she really likes someone a lot,

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.804
she opens it up

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:08.645
and gives them a bit of her love.

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.768
Then she closes it up again.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.126
Sweet, huh?

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.448
I've never seen her like this before.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.523
What's this spot?

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.764
I don't know.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.884
It's from the old clothes collection
down in the cellar.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.727
Don't you find it creepy
to wear old clothes?

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.331
Why?

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.686
Maybe somebody died in them.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.889
I don't find that creepy.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.925
Quite the contrary.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.362
As you feel the floor,

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:27.407
you also feel the pulse in your hands.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:42.640
You feel how it makes the ground tremble.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.725
How it becomes one with the environment.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:53.409
How it lets your whole body
and the whole world around you

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:58.290
connect and flow into each other.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.407
And your pulse

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.806
becomes green, fruitful,

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.086
healthy leaves,

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.363
with the limbs of those
laying next to you.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.407
The limbs connect with the...

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:27.488
Perhaps you should go
get a little fresh air.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.281
Here.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.370
It's like time travel.

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.044
Me in 15 years.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.002
And me in 30 years.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.685
I'm looking forward to getting older.

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:31.209
But I've gotta get out of this backwater.

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:36.408
I didn't even get a real drag!

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.529
And you shouldn't, either.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.724
I might have gotten you pregnant.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.441
So?

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.006
Right,

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.842
anything our princess desires.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.009
Ann!
- Ann!

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.724
Oh man, what are you doing?

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:52.120
Careful, it's poisonous.
You shouldn't get it in your eyes.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:53.401
Not at all.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.201
No! Not at all.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.281
Ann?

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.686
Ann!

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.201
Ann!

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.529
Where are you going?

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.328
Ann, where are you going?

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.285
Wait!

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:04.524
The water's coming in.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.250
We've got to go.

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.966
We could restore a Ferris wheel.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:10.883
And then travel the whole world.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:19.969
And to brush our teeth at night
we just go up and spit down.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:23.010
Let go.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.120
And Ole and Lilly?

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.888
They'd come along, or what?

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.091
Lilly, yeah.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.731
And Ole?

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:05.286
Yes, sweetie, I'm much better. Yeah.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.609
Just one more night, and I'll be back.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.643
Will you give Daddy a kiss for me?

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:12.565
I love you too.

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.809
I need you guys.

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.405
Stop.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.445
Stop!

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:21.210
What is it?

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.846
You're just hurting yourself.
- Why?

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.209
Ann's not getting healthy.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.248
What does she have, anyway?

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.201
Mum?

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.600
Mum?

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.006
Mum!

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.850
Where were you?

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.561
I have this phrase in my mind.

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.844
And it makes me so endlessly sad,

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.408
because it gives me the feeling
that everything is over now.

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.204
What's the phrase?

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.444
In the morning, there was still
grass in front of my window.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.882
I know, Lilly needs you.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.807
What if I can't handle it again?

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:58.728
Then imagine that we're on a green meadow.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.924
And the grass
is still very damp from the night.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.968
But the sun is drying it slowly.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:11.080
And near us a group of calves is grazing.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.171
They're shy,

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.447
but one walks over to us

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.689
and stands in front of you

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.203
and smells your hair.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.163
You can feel the calf's breath
on your face.

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:31.688
Then you hold your hand out

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:37.124
and the little calf rolls its
rough tongue over your hand.

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.366
Thanks.

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.609
If you could also be to yourself
the way you were earlier with Frenja,

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.962
then you would never have to be here.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.687
I'm only here because of you now.

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.689
Do you promise me?

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.201
What?

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.807
That you'll always be that way
with yourself.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:23.646
OK.

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:36.441
Sweet dreams of sour pickles.

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:42.442
What does that mean, anyway?

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.691
That many things aren't as bad

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.484
as they appear.

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.368
Did you know that the Inuit

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:45.050
wander out on the ice to die?

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:50.128
When they decide
their life should come to an end,

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.971
they just walk out there,
out to open sea.

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:58.886
They lay down
and wait to freeze to death

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:01.162
and become a part of the sea forever.

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.243
I've always asked myself

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.442
when the point comes

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.441
when they decide to go.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.480
Perhaps they are especially happy,

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:20.531
and fulfilled with what lies behind them?

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:28.730
One shouldn't miss that point.

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:06.809
