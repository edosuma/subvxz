06:13.538 --> 06:14.774
Hello?

06:15.841 --> 06:18.043
Hello!

06:19.845 --> 06:22.711
What the hell?

06:22.713 --> 06:26.052
How the hell did I drive a car
into a warehouse?

06:32.990 --> 06:34.394
Come on.

06:35.661 --> 06:36.928
Son of a...

06:38.129 --> 06:39.464
No.

06:44.802 --> 06:45.937
Hey!

06:49.774 --> 06:51.676
Hey!

06:56.548 --> 06:57.983
Wait!

07:00.985 --> 07:02.519
Wait!

07:06.658 --> 07:08.795
Hello. Hello?

07:43.194 --> 07:44.497
Hello?

07:45.797 --> 07:47.897
<i>Wes.</i>

07:47.899 --> 07:50.567
<i>I'm glad you can
finally join us.</i>

07:50.569 --> 07:52.034
No, it's...

07:52.036 --> 07:53.870
<i>Dr. Wes Nolan?</i>

07:53.872 --> 07:56.005
Doctor? No, no, no.

07:56.007 --> 07:59.009
It doesn't ring a bell.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.276
I just...

08:00.278 --> 08:02.711
<i>We know you lost your memory.</i>

08:02.713 --> 08:04.848
<i>Please, listen carefully.</i>

08:04.850 --> 08:08.218
What am I doing here and
what the hell is on my ankle?

08:08.220 --> 08:13.822
<i>Precautions have been taken
to ensure you do what's needed.</i>

08:13.824 --> 08:16.625
Who are you?!

08:16.627 --> 08:18.096
<i>I'm Lazarus.</i>

08:19.964 --> 08:23.065
Right, right.

08:23.067 --> 08:27.002
So Bethany's just
an empty warehouse, right?

08:27.004 --> 08:29.906
Will you listen to me,
Mrs. Lazarus?

08:29.908 --> 08:32.607
When I say I don't know,
that's exactly what I mean.

08:32.610 --> 08:34.643
I don't know!

08:34.645 --> 08:35.878
<i>Nothing?</i>

08:35.880 --> 08:37.647
I don't remember!

08:37.649 --> 08:41.153
I-I... I don't.

08:44.956 --> 08:46.355
Nothing.

08:46.357 --> 08:48.257
I don't remember.

08:48.259 --> 08:49.825
I just...

08:49.827 --> 08:51.227
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

08:51.229 --> 08:52.929
What?

08:55.067 --> 08:57.269
Hello. Hello?

09:37.743 --> 09:40.009
There you are.

09:40.011 --> 09:41.713
Wes Nolan.

11:11.436 --> 11:14.470
<i>I wouldn't do that
if I were you.</i>

11:14.472 --> 11:16.805
Do what?

11:16.807 --> 11:19.843
<i>Do not try
to get out of here.</i>

11:19.845 --> 11:21.344
Why?

11:21.346 --> 11:24.814
<i>It isn't safe, Wes.</i>

11:24.816 --> 11:26.849
Tell me this, can you see me?

11:26.851 --> 11:28.818
<i>See and hear you.</i>

11:28.820 --> 11:31.488
Why all the bullshit
with the phone, huh?

11:31.490 --> 11:35.257
<i>I couldn't get connected
to the system.</i>

11:35.259 --> 11:37.794
<i>Please, Wes, don't do it.</i>

11:37.796 --> 11:39.528
<i>We need you in here.</i>

11:39.530 --> 11:41.464
I have no idea what the hell
you're talking about.

11:49.006 --> 11:50.341
<i>Wes?</i>

11:51.509 --> 11:52.711
<i>Wes?</i>

12:00.985 --> 12:02.484
<i>I tried to warn you, Wes.</i>

12:02.486 --> 12:03.552
Shit!

12:03.554 --> 12:05.387
<i>We can't let you go.</i>

12:05.389 --> 12:07.223
<i>It's dangerous out there.</i>

12:07.225 --> 12:10.493
<i>We don't want you
to get hurt.</i>

12:10.495 --> 12:12.362
Who's we?

12:12.364 --> 12:14.164
You, Mary, and Martha?

12:14.166 --> 12:16.431
<i>That is not important
right now.</i>

12:16.433 --> 12:20.402
<i>What is important is that you
understand a few ground rules.</i>

12:20.404 --> 12:23.205
Tell me what the hell
the ground rules are.

12:23.207 --> 12:26.975
<i>You can move anywhere within
the confines of this facility,</i>

12:26.977 --> 12:29.145
<i>but any attempt to leave
will have consequences.</i>

12:31.015 --> 12:32.982
<i>First, the ankle bracelet
you are wearing</i>

12:32.984 --> 12:36.088
<i>will deliver a thousand volts
through your body.</i>

12:38.190 --> 12:41.123
Surely, that's enough
to keep me here, right?

12:41.125 --> 12:43.092
<i>Sadly not.</i>

12:43.094 --> 12:47.530
<i>Some of us thought you would
require a stronger incentive.</i>

12:47.532 --> 12:49.898
Well, what the hell is that?

12:49.900 --> 12:51.901
<i>You cross the line,
and the signal</i>

12:51.903 --> 12:54.304
<i>will automatically be sent
to our representatives,</i>

12:54.306 --> 12:57.306
<i>keeping a close eye
on your family.</i>

12:57.308 --> 12:59.309
Family?

12:59.311 --> 13:02.045
What the hell are you
talking about, family?

13:02.047 --> 13:04.914
<i>Look at your left hand.</i>

13:04.916 --> 13:06.616
<i>Her name is Leah.</i>

13:06.618 --> 13:09.088
<i>She is with your daughter.</i>

13:12.923 --> 13:14.159
You can't.

13:17.095 --> 13:19.228
You can't!

13:19.230 --> 13:22.100
<i>It's for your own protection.</i>

13:24.101 --> 13:27.603
<i>There's a third thing
you need to know.</i>

13:27.605 --> 13:30.006
Let me guess.

13:30.008 --> 13:34.243
I try to take it off,
you shock my ass again, right?

13:34.245 --> 13:36.345
<i>Not quite.</i>

13:36.347 --> 13:38.480
<i>If you make any attempt
to tamper to bracelet,</i>

13:38.482 --> 13:41.950
<i>it will explode and
take off your lower half.</i>

13:48.460 --> 13:50.392
Of course.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.127
Of course.

13:52.129 --> 13:56.465
It's my least favorite half
anyway.

13:56.467 --> 13:59.469
Why don't you tell me what
the hell you want from me, huh?

13:59.471 --> 14:01.637
What do you want?

14:01.639 --> 14:04.973
<i>You can start
by going upstairs.</i>

14:04.975 --> 14:10.014
<i>Wes, I'm your ally,
not your enemy.</i>

14:12.417 --> 14:15.151
Okay.

14:15.153 --> 14:16.322
Okay.

14:18.155 --> 14:19.324
Fine.

14:23.394 --> 14:26.262
<i>I can understand
you cannot remember,</i>

14:26.264 --> 14:29.398
<i>but this is not
you against us.</i>

14:29.400 --> 14:31.169
<i>We're in it together.</i>

14:36.707 --> 14:39.007
<i>We are a team.</i>

14:39.009 --> 14:42.615
<i>Our methods may be extreme,
but necessary.</i>

14:45.082 --> 14:48.718
<i>It's the only way for you
to get back your memory.</i>

14:48.720 --> 14:51.421
<i>It's the only way for us
to get what we paid for</i>

14:51.423 --> 14:54.556
<i>and stop this nightmare.</i>

14:54.558 --> 14:57.428
<i>I need your help, Wes.</i>

15:41.105 --> 15:43.205
What the hell is that?

15:43.207 --> 15:45.374
<i>Your new home.
And I need you to tell me</i>

15:45.376 --> 15:47.709
<i>everything that you
know about it.</i>

15:47.711 --> 15:50.012
You seem to be forgetting
I'm suffering

15:50.014 --> 15:52.315
from a little situation
of my own.

15:52.317 --> 15:55.184
How the hell
I'm supposed to help you

15:55.186 --> 15:58.720
if I can't even recognize
my own face?

15:58.722 --> 16:01.359
<i>We're willing
to take that chance.</i>

16:05.330 --> 16:07.763
What if you're wrong?

16:07.765 --> 16:10.301
<i>That isn't an option.</i>

17:08.093 --> 17:10.392
You still there?

17:10.394 --> 17:12.327
<i>I'm not going anywhere.</i>

17:12.329 --> 17:14.396
<i>You're stuck with me.</i>

17:14.397 --> 17:16.798
You said I was your last hope.

17:16.800 --> 17:20.236
<i>I didn't say that, exactly.</i>

17:20.238 --> 17:22.204
Well, it's close enough.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.242
<i>Yes, close enough.</i>

17:32.851 --> 17:36.219
Tell your associates
they're screwed.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.787
I don't recognize any of this.

17:38.789 --> 17:42.260
I don't know the password.
This means nothing to me.

17:44.662 --> 17:47.497
<i>I can talk you through
what needs to be done.</i>

17:47.499 --> 17:50.068
<i>Hopefully,
that would jog your memory.</i>

17:56.273 --> 17:58.443
<i>Not a good start, Wes.</i>

18:02.680 --> 18:06.349
If you're counting on me for
this, you're out of luck, okay?

18:06.351 --> 18:08.320
<i>You remember Leah.</i>

18:11.722 --> 18:14.358
You mean my family, right?

18:15.559 --> 18:16.761
Leah.

18:20.365 --> 18:22.797
Tell me,
what's my daughter's name?

18:22.799 --> 18:25.870
<i>Loni. L-O-N-I.</i>

18:27.805 --> 18:29.872
Why the hell
can't I remember that?

18:29.874 --> 18:32.310
<i>Because of the accident.</i>

18:34.778 --> 18:36.778
You gonna tell me
what this place is,

18:36.780 --> 18:38.881
what the hell
I'm doing here?

18:38.883 --> 18:42.351
<i>You are a virologist.</i>

18:42.353 --> 18:44.319
Yeah.

18:44.321 --> 18:46.922
I'm not sure these are
the hands of a scientist.

18:46.924 --> 18:50.162
<i>I can assure you they are.</i>

18:51.429 --> 18:53.528
Do we know each other?

18:53.530 --> 18:56.966
<i>Better than you think,
but we never met.</i>

18:56.968 --> 18:59.602
Why don't you get your ass
in here and help me, huh?

18:59.604 --> 19:01.804
<i>That's not how this works.</i>

19:01.806 --> 19:05.144
No? Well, how does it
work then, huh?

19:07.511 --> 19:10.214
What if I trash the place?

19:12.616 --> 19:16.251
<i>Do you know
what is in there?</i>

19:16.253 --> 19:18.688
No. Should I?

19:18.690 --> 19:22.594
<i>The most dangerous virus
known to mankind.</i>

19:23.694 --> 19:25.961
<i>You created it.</i>

19:25.963 --> 19:27.863
Of course.

19:27.865 --> 19:30.568
Of course. Things are just
getting better and better.

19:33.904 --> 19:36.174
Did the virus get out?

19:40.577 --> 19:42.713
How many were infected?

19:45.383 --> 19:48.883
How many were infected?!

19:48.885 --> 19:52.257
<i>Calm down, Wes.
Please calm down.</i>

20:01.432 --> 20:03.298
<i>It was an accident.</i>

20:03.300 --> 20:05.500
How did it happen?

20:05.502 --> 20:08.970
<i>It was the fourth
Ebola outbreak of 2018.</i>

20:08.972 --> 20:12.040
<i>We thought we contained it,
but we were wrong.</i>

20:12.042 --> 20:15.311
<i>The virus had mutated.</i>

20:15.313 --> 20:18.980
Okay. What the hell
did I have to do with it?

20:18.982 --> 20:20.982
<i>You tried to engineer
a bacteria</i>

20:20.984 --> 20:22.584
<i>that would attack the Ebola</i>

20:22.586 --> 20:26.322
<i>before it could destroy
the human cells.</i>

20:26.324 --> 20:28.024
What do you mean?

20:28.026 --> 20:30.862
<i>You tried to save
the human race.</i>

20:32.063 --> 20:34.363
So what went wrong?

20:34.365 --> 20:36.532
<i>Instead of destroying
the Ebola,</i>

20:36.534 --> 20:40.803
<i>the virus mutated to something
we'd never seen before.</i>

20:40.805 --> 20:42.505
How bad?

20:42.507 --> 20:45.373
<i>Worse than
we could've ever imagined.</i>

20:45.375 --> 20:48.544
<i>The body count is immeasurable.</i>

20:48.546 --> 20:50.845
So the virus leaked out.

20:50.847 --> 20:53.516
<i>Because the lab was destroyed.</i>

20:53.518 --> 20:56.419
How?

20:56.421 --> 20:58.353
How?!

20:58.355 --> 21:00.756
<i>It's dangerous out there.</i>

21:00.758 --> 21:02.924
<i>You have to stay in here.</i>

21:02.926 --> 21:06.495
<i>You can still make
a difference if you don't die.</i>

21:06.497 --> 21:08.064
What?

21:08.066 --> 21:09.664
<i>Things have changed.</i>

21:09.666 --> 21:11.669
What do you mean, changed?

21:13.904 --> 21:16.838
- Lazarus...
- <i>Don't do it.</i>

21:42.066 --> 21:43.802
Lazarus.

21:45.670 --> 21:47.836
I...

21:47.838 --> 21:50.605
I need a password.
I can't...

21:50.607 --> 21:51.676
<i>I don't have it.</i>

21:55.680 --> 21:56.845
Hey!

21:56.847 --> 21:58.517
<i>What is it?</i>

22:00.384 --> 22:02.450
There's someone else here.

22:02.452 --> 22:04.388
<i>That's impossible.</i>

22:06.590 --> 22:09.057
<i>You're wasting your time.
We need you in the lab.</i>

22:09.059 --> 22:10.992
<i>Please, Wes, come back.</i>

22:10.994 --> 22:12.396
<i>Please.</i>

22:22.906 --> 22:24.475
Hey!

22:25.910 --> 22:28.143
<i>You are only wasting time.</i>

22:28.145 --> 22:30.746
I'll be the judge of that.

22:30.748 --> 22:32.515
<i>What are you doing?</i>

22:32.517 --> 22:34.820
I'm just making shit up
as I go.

22:55.472 --> 22:56.607
Hey!

22:57.942 --> 22:59.510
Hey!

23:08.452 --> 23:09.488
Hey!

23:17.929 --> 23:19.431
Hey!

23:21.164 --> 23:23.501
Look, I mean no harm.

23:34.711 --> 23:36.711
Stop! Stop it!

23:36.713 --> 23:38.517
Calm down.

23:40.750 --> 23:41.787
Wes.

23:43.988 --> 23:46.221
I thought you were dead.

23:46.223 --> 23:48.824
How do I know you?

23:48.826 --> 23:50.593
I'm Kalie.

23:50.595 --> 23:53.696
How do I...
How do I know you?

23:53.698 --> 23:55.967
I'm Kalie Jorgensen.

24:37.173 --> 24:39.243
What did they do to you?

24:41.546 --> 24:44.613
I was in a car accident,
and I just...

24:44.615 --> 24:46.882
It was a car accident.

24:46.884 --> 24:50.885
But I...
I don't remember this.

24:50.887 --> 24:54.189
Where am I?
What is this place?

24:54.191 --> 24:56.225
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

24:56.227 --> 24:58.928
I'm here to help you.
Let's get you back the lab.

24:58.930 --> 25:00.194
Come on.

25:00.196 --> 25:02.166
- I thought...
- Come on. Now!

25:15.913 --> 25:18.013
Come in!

25:18.015 --> 25:19.614
Captain?

25:19.616 --> 25:22.653
We found a signal
and have located Lazarus.

25:27.857 --> 25:29.792
Are you sure?

25:29.794 --> 25:31.863
She's in the Dark Zone.

25:34.097 --> 25:36.734
Okay, I'll be right there.

26:14.838 --> 26:16.106
What the hell?

26:25.082 --> 26:27.382
Is Lazarus with you?

26:27.384 --> 26:29.985
<i>I'm here, Mrs. Jorgensen.</i>

26:29.987 --> 26:31.987
I'm just here to help.

26:31.989 --> 26:34.023
<i>This can only work
in our favor.</i>

26:34.025 --> 26:35.990
What the hell
is she talking about?

26:35.992 --> 26:40.228
- You really don't remember?
- No, I don't!

26:40.230 --> 26:43.731
I was your assistant.

26:43.733 --> 26:47.001
Okay, do you remember
how we created the virus?

26:47.003 --> 26:51.840
I don't.
I need you to show me.

26:51.842 --> 26:53.142
Wonderful.

26:56.047 --> 26:57.779
Are you sure
she's with him?

26:57.781 --> 27:00.449
Where there's Lazarus,
there is Nolan.

27:00.451 --> 27:01.720
Right.

27:03.887 --> 27:05.888
Come on,
they're in the Dark Zone.

27:05.890 --> 27:08.023
We have no other choice.

27:08.025 --> 27:12.126
It's a risk we're
gonna have to take.

27:12.128 --> 27:13.664
Sinclair.

27:19.303 --> 27:21.303
I take it that you know
the password, right?

27:21.305 --> 27:24.275
Only you know it.
Security precaution.

27:26.076 --> 27:27.709
Okay.

27:27.711 --> 27:31.279
Is there anything,
any details you can give me

27:31.281 --> 27:33.684
to help me remember?

27:35.452 --> 27:38.322
What did you name the virus?

27:44.994 --> 27:46.764
Flashburn.

27:47.998 --> 27:49.933
I named it Flashburn.

27:56.106 --> 27:58.207
<i>Well done, Wes.</i>

27:58.209 --> 27:59.443
That's it.

28:03.413 --> 28:05.346
Jesus Christ!

28:05.348 --> 28:08.016
- Ah!
- Stop, stop.

28:08.018 --> 28:09.317
Let me look at this.

28:09.319 --> 28:11.288
<i>Show him, Kalie.</i>

28:13.457 --> 28:17.028
Okay, fine, but you have
to wear a mask and gloves.

28:30.473 --> 28:32.409
<i>I need to see her arm.</i>

28:38.782 --> 28:41.182
Here. Satisfied?

28:41.184 --> 28:46.154
<i>I need you to do
exactly as I say.</i>

28:46.156 --> 28:49.024
<i>You'll find syringes
in the drawer.</i>

28:49.026 --> 28:51.028
You don't have to do this.

28:54.064 --> 28:58.169
<i>Open the fridge and take
the vial Flashburn number 7.</i>

29:05.976 --> 29:08.947
<i>Mix it with her blood
and see if it turns black.</i>

29:28.566 --> 29:30.934
Okay, that can't be good.

29:32.869 --> 29:34.402
I need a vaccine.

29:34.404 --> 29:37.442
You're my only hope.

29:39.042 --> 29:42.177
How did it happen?

29:42.179 --> 29:45.247
I cut it...

29:45.249 --> 29:47.615
coming out of your car.

29:47.617 --> 29:51.519
What do you mean, my car?
Where were we going?

29:51.521 --> 29:53.421
I don't know for sure.

29:53.423 --> 29:55.356
Something was happening
back at GenoCal.

29:55.358 --> 29:58.163
There was
a facility lockdown.

30:02.365 --> 30:05.199
- GenoCal.
- You were the lead virologist.

30:05.201 --> 30:07.035
There was some sort
of security breach,

30:07.037 --> 30:09.340
and you insisted
that we leave right away.

30:29.593 --> 30:30.894
Wes.

30:32.296 --> 30:35.363
Wes, wake up.

30:35.365 --> 30:36.401
Wake up.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.071
Wake up, Wes!

30:43.073 --> 30:45.340
So the men came,
and they were shooting at us.

30:48.511 --> 30:51.215
I thought you were dead,
so I ran, and I hid for hours.

30:55.251 --> 30:58.519
How did we crash my car
in a locked warehouse, Kalie?

30:58.521 --> 31:01.923
I... I don't know.

31:01.925 --> 31:03.926
I need you tell me
the truth, Kalie,

31:03.928 --> 31:06.094
if you want me to help you.

31:06.096 --> 31:08.333
I don't know.

32:47.230 --> 32:49.534
Straight to the van, Kalie.

33:12.623 --> 33:14.424
I have a visual.

33:29.272 --> 33:31.742
Look! The fence.

33:35.345 --> 33:38.113
No! Sit down!

33:48.092 --> 33:49.060
Get this car started.

34:02.506 --> 34:03.771
Milton.

34:03.773 --> 34:05.575
I'm on it.

34:55.492 --> 34:58.360
Okay, you said that we're
using the virus as a weapon.

34:58.362 --> 35:00.398
Who? The army?

35:01.465 --> 35:02.633
Shh.

35:04.835 --> 35:07.438
We should get back to work.

35:27.590 --> 35:30.659
I'm getting you out of here.

35:30.661 --> 35:32.459
<i>Don't do it, Wes.</i>

35:32.461 --> 35:35.429
Yeah, well, I'm not
listening to you anymore.

35:35.431 --> 35:38.902
<i>Do not trust her.
I'm your only way out.</i>

35:41.204 --> 35:43.204
<i>She is manipulating you.</i>

35:43.206 --> 35:46.474
<i>She's playing
with your emotions.</i>

35:46.476 --> 35:49.680
Let me see your leg.
Ankle, the other one.

35:51.914 --> 35:53.847
<i>Please, Wes.</i>

35:53.849 --> 35:55.483
<i>Go back.</i>

35:55.485 --> 35:58.286
<i>I need you focused
on finding the vaccine.</i>

36:40.797 --> 36:43.430
<i>What did I tell you?</i>

36:43.432 --> 36:44.936
Stop it!

36:47.036 --> 36:48.637
<i>I will let you out of here</i>

36:48.639 --> 36:50.708
<i>once you fix
what you have created.</i>

37:22.005 --> 37:24.438
- Kalie.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

37:24.440 --> 37:27.641
<i>Someone else
is with Lazarus.</i>

37:27.643 --> 37:29.811
What do you mean,
someone else?

37:29.813 --> 37:33.481
- A second dot has appeared.
- <i>Like a glitch?</i>

37:33.483 --> 37:36.083
<i>That's what I thought
at first, but it moves.</i>

37:36.085 --> 37:38.853
<i>Definitely not a shadow image.</i>

37:38.855 --> 37:42.724
We'll just be careful
when we get there.

37:42.726 --> 37:44.028
Thank you.

37:45.528 --> 37:47.662
<i>We're gonna need gas.</i>

37:47.664 --> 37:49.664
32 miles ahead of you.

37:49.666 --> 37:51.635
How can there be
someone else with Lazarus?

37:53.637 --> 37:55.570
I don't know.

37:55.572 --> 37:59.673
<i>They are not going
to come to the second floor.</i>

37:59.675 --> 38:02.279
You know what?
I'm not taking any chances.

38:04.780 --> 38:06.680
<i>We are the ones
who wanted you here.</i>

38:06.682 --> 38:08.349
<i>You wanted out.</i>

38:08.351 --> 38:11.086
Maybe so, lady,
but I'm having a big problem

38:11.088 --> 38:14.389
finding any logic
in this at all.

38:14.391 --> 38:18.693
<i>This is not about you,
Kalie, or I.</i>

38:18.695 --> 38:20.994
<i>The epidemic is spreading fast.</i>

38:20.996 --> 38:23.333
<i>The world needs you.</i>

38:49.925 --> 38:51.862
Are you Leah?

38:54.030 --> 38:55.833
Who's Leah?

38:58.001 --> 39:00.338
She's my wife.

39:01.438 --> 39:03.003
No.

39:03.005 --> 39:05.407
I'm Kalie.

39:05.409 --> 39:07.141
Right.

39:07.143 --> 39:09.110
Right.

39:09.112 --> 39:11.514
How do you feel?

39:22.893 --> 39:24.559
What about this?
These red dots.

39:24.561 --> 39:28.729
That mean anything to you?
It means nothing to me.

39:28.731 --> 39:30.701
This is an old map.

39:32.869 --> 39:34.405
How do you know it's old?

39:37.139 --> 39:40.641
The red dots
are the infected areas,

39:40.643 --> 39:42.677
the blue dots are at risk,

39:42.679 --> 39:45.914
and the yellow dots,
they were safe havens.

39:45.916 --> 39:47.785
What do you mean, were?

39:49.952 --> 39:51.985
It's not like this anymore.

39:51.987 --> 39:54.988
The entire North American
continent is contaminated.

39:54.990 --> 39:58.959
<i>That's why we don't want you
to leave the premises.</i>

39:58.961 --> 40:01.662
Yeah, well, I was
just out on the rooftop.

40:01.664 --> 40:04.032
How did that happen?

40:04.034 --> 40:05.900
<i>The rooftop
was not a good idea.</i>

40:05.902 --> 40:08.172
<i>You may be contaminated.</i>

40:10.239 --> 40:13.775
What about this?
Any of this?

40:13.777 --> 40:17.748
I'm trying, but I just...
I can't remember.

40:19.548 --> 40:22.617
Some of it, but I can't
figure out the equations

40:22.619 --> 40:25.556
unless I know
how you applied them.

40:27.791 --> 40:29.460
What about this?

40:32.528 --> 40:33.994
There.

40:33.996 --> 40:35.799
Does it help any?

40:40.103 --> 40:42.173
I don't know what this is.

40:47.043 --> 40:50.778
Oh, my God,
I understand it all.

40:50.780 --> 40:53.847
Is your memory coming back?

40:53.849 --> 40:55.853
I think so.

40:57.987 --> 41:01.858
You have to make an effort,
Wes, please.

41:04.561 --> 41:05.894
We knew each other.

41:05.896 --> 41:09.664
- I was just your assistant.
- No.

41:09.666 --> 41:11.865
It was more than that.

41:11.867 --> 41:13.570
No.

42:12.996 --> 42:14.097
Milton.

42:15.864 --> 42:17.600
Milton.

42:23.706 --> 42:24.974
Milton!

42:32.681 --> 42:34.081
I'm here.

42:34.083 --> 42:35.883
<i>Where were you?</i>

42:35.885 --> 42:38.853
I have to pee
once in a while.

42:38.855 --> 42:40.822
Try that in a hazmat suit.

42:40.824 --> 42:42.624
Okay.

42:42.626 --> 42:44.291
We're at the gas station.

42:44.293 --> 42:47.128
I have a visual.

42:47.130 --> 42:48.695
<i>Any danger?</i>

42:48.697 --> 42:51.199
Area secured.

42:51.201 --> 42:55.572
Okay, thank you.
We're stepping out.

43:57.967 --> 43:59.936
It's working.

44:48.016 --> 44:49.252
Milton.

44:54.423 --> 44:56.192
Everything's okay.

45:00.396 --> 45:02.032
Sinclair!

45:08.838 --> 45:11.005
Sinclair!

45:11.007 --> 45:12.376
Come out!

45:23.786 --> 45:26.920
- Lower your rifle!
- I won't!

45:26.922 --> 45:29.824
We don't want to hurt you!

45:29.826 --> 45:32.492
- You already did!
- What do you want?

45:32.494 --> 45:34.327
The vaccine
I've been promised!

45:34.329 --> 45:37.034
- We don't have it!
- Then he dies.

45:44.173 --> 45:45.907
Guns on the ground.

45:45.909 --> 45:48.175
What?

45:48.177 --> 45:50.913
You heard what I said.
Guns on the ground!

46:01.891 --> 46:04.825
What's your name?

46:04.827 --> 46:07.295
Dylan McKenzie.

46:07.297 --> 46:10.264
I'm Kalie Jorgensen.

46:10.266 --> 46:12.032
This is Jack Stewart,

46:12.034 --> 46:15.903
and the man you're about to kill
is Luke Sinclair.

46:15.905 --> 46:18.072
I don't wanna kill anyone!

46:18.074 --> 46:22.175
I just want the vaccine
the government promised me!

46:22.177 --> 46:25.281
Are you alone in there?

46:26.882 --> 46:29.617
I proved you
my good faith.

46:29.619 --> 46:31.555
Are you alone in there?

46:34.023 --> 46:36.891
My wife and my daughter
are with me.

46:36.893 --> 46:39.459
- Are they infected?
- They are.

46:39.461 --> 46:42.896
- What about yourself?
- Not yet.

46:42.898 --> 46:45.566
Look.

46:45.568 --> 46:47.534
We can help you.

46:47.536 --> 46:49.903
You just have to trust me.

46:49.905 --> 46:53.007
I want the vaccine
the government promised me!

46:53.009 --> 46:55.443
There is no government!

46:55.445 --> 46:58.115
- You're U.S. Army.
- What's left of it.

46:59.882 --> 47:03.920
Dylan, you have to let us in!

47:07.023 --> 47:09.289
Get in!

47:09.291 --> 47:12.059
Move!

47:12.061 --> 47:13.030
Move it!

47:17.599 --> 47:19.135
Move it!

47:23.639 --> 47:25.908
I said get in! Move!

47:35.150 --> 47:37.517
So, Ms. Jorgensen...

47:37.519 --> 47:39.987
Call me Kalie.

47:39.989 --> 47:42.055
What the fuck is going on?

47:42.057 --> 47:43.624
You know as much as I do.

47:43.626 --> 47:45.693
I don't know anything,
except what I been promised.

47:45.695 --> 47:47.695
Yeah, I got that part,

47:47.697 --> 47:52.365
but the people that promised it
to you are no longer with us.

47:52.367 --> 47:54.438
Where's your wife and daughter?

47:56.005 --> 47:57.371
In there.

47:57.373 --> 47:58.539
What stage?

47:58.541 --> 48:00.441
Terminal, for all I know.

48:00.443 --> 48:02.275
You know about
the meltdown?

48:02.277 --> 48:07.414
Whatever I saw on the TV till
all the channels went blank.

48:07.416 --> 48:10.050
The first one to give up
was Arkansas Nuclear One.

48:10.052 --> 48:13.320
It provoked a chain reaction.
In a matter of hours,

48:13.322 --> 48:15.456
it was followed by
the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station

48:15.458 --> 48:17.224
in Mississippi,

48:17.226 --> 48:20.094
then the Waterford Steam
Electric Station in Louisiana,

48:20.096 --> 48:22.496
and the South Texas Project
in Bay City.

48:22.498 --> 48:25.066
A total of 12 nuclear reactors
gave up,

48:25.068 --> 48:26.499
creating the Dark Zone.

48:26.501 --> 48:28.702
What's this have to do
with the epidemic?

48:28.704 --> 48:30.204
Because of the meltdown,

48:30.206 --> 48:32.305
an experimental virus
called Flashburn

48:32.307 --> 48:35.608
was released by a secret
facility called GenoCal.

48:35.610 --> 48:38.144
So it was
the government's fault.

48:38.146 --> 48:40.613
We're not here to point fingers.
We're not on trial.

48:40.615 --> 48:42.483
My wife and my daughter
need it now.

48:42.485 --> 48:46.354
Look, I wish I could help you,
but I can't yet.

48:46.356 --> 48:48.389
They have no time left.

48:48.391 --> 48:51.458
There's a man.
His name is Wes Nolan.

48:51.460 --> 48:54.762
He's a virologist.
He may have the vaccine.

48:54.764 --> 48:58.264
- Where is he?
- Deep in the Dark Zone.

48:58.266 --> 49:00.467
No one survives the Dark Zone.

49:00.469 --> 49:03.104
Our intel says
that he's alive,

49:03.106 --> 49:06.673
and that's where
we're headed now.

49:06.675 --> 49:09.409
You've got two choices.

49:09.411 --> 49:13.079
You can kill us and
kill your family or let us go,

49:13.081 --> 49:16.052
and we bring Wes back
and help them.

49:18.121 --> 49:20.724
It's gonna be too late.

49:24.460 --> 49:26.396
It may be.

49:50.719 --> 49:52.052
Stop!

49:52.054 --> 49:53.454
Stop it! I said stop!

49:53.456 --> 49:55.555
Stop! Stop it, please!

49:55.557 --> 49:57.157
Stop it, honey!

49:57.159 --> 49:59.559
Stop, stop, stop!

49:59.561 --> 50:00.827
Stop it!

50:00.829 --> 50:03.000
Stop!

50:12.340 --> 50:14.175
So what went wrong?

50:14.177 --> 50:18.345
The initial tests
were successful, then...

50:18.347 --> 50:21.215
this happened.

50:21.217 --> 50:23.784
We don't know why, but the virus
and the modified bacteria

50:23.786 --> 50:25.789
joined together in symbiosis.

50:42.170 --> 50:45.139
What does Flashburn do?

50:45.141 --> 50:48.842
It takes control of your brain
and makes you do things.

50:48.844 --> 50:51.612
Like what?
What things does it make you do?

50:51.614 --> 50:53.813
Anything to infect
other people.

50:53.815 --> 50:57.684
A bite, a scratch,
a kiss, sex.

50:57.686 --> 50:59.155
Then what?

51:00.856 --> 51:03.326
It eats you from the inside.

52:03.219 --> 52:05.786
<i>I remember.</i>

52:05.788 --> 52:08.621
<i>I remember everything.</i>

52:39.222 --> 52:41.789
It's high-security premises.

52:41.791 --> 52:44.425
Something is going on.

52:44.427 --> 52:46.427
What are you talking about?

52:46.429 --> 52:49.166
I started noticing
a week ago that...

52:51.701 --> 52:53.700
...vials are going missing.

52:53.702 --> 52:56.237
- They're being misplaced.
- What?

52:56.239 --> 52:57.637
The color of the vaccine
is being different.

52:57.639 --> 52:59.373
Why didn't you
tell me this earlier?

52:59.375 --> 53:02.278
I wasn't sure, so I started
to take pictures. Look.

53:04.713 --> 53:06.479
Kalie, this is empty.

53:06.481 --> 53:09.550
There's no photos
in this folder.

53:09.552 --> 53:11.885
There were 349 last night.

53:11.887 --> 53:14.854
The birthdays, Christmases,
my parents' 50th anniversary,

53:14.856 --> 53:16.423
they're all gone.

53:16.425 --> 53:18.425
Okay, that doesn't
mean anything.

53:18.427 --> 53:19.726
It doesn't,
but this morning,

53:19.728 --> 53:21.929
I woke up with
a severe headache.

53:21.931 --> 53:23.530
Did you have
one of your migraines?

53:23.532 --> 53:26.733
No. It was so bad

53:26.735 --> 53:29.802
that it felt like
I was drugged.

53:29.804 --> 53:32.373
So I tested myself
for Diprivan.

53:32.375 --> 53:33.510
And?

53:35.945 --> 53:39.481
I think they're using
our mutated virus as a weapon.

53:49.425 --> 53:50.894
This is it.

53:52.360 --> 53:55.795
I remember this.
This is the vaccine.

53:55.797 --> 53:58.032
It was always here.

53:58.034 --> 54:01.367
Right in front of our eyes.

54:01.369 --> 54:03.239
Then why?

54:05.675 --> 54:07.644
Where did you find it?

54:21.356 --> 54:22.492
Let's go.

54:41.409 --> 54:43.612
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

55:30.059 --> 55:32.095
Do you understand the risk?

55:33.963 --> 55:36.666
Okay, do it.
Just do it.

55:45.673 --> 55:47.344
It works.

55:50.612 --> 55:53.082
Just wait to make sure
it stabilizes.

56:01.023 --> 56:02.856
Okay.

56:02.858 --> 56:05.191
- Stay right there. Stay here.
- You only have one bullet.

56:05.193 --> 56:07.628
You only have one bullet left.

56:07.630 --> 56:09.499
Just stay here.

57:16.764 --> 57:18.067
Kalie...

57:20.702 --> 57:21.802
<i>Wes?</i>

57:21.804 --> 57:23.103
Lazarus, I...

57:23.105 --> 57:26.139
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

57:26.141 --> 57:28.208
I'm on the roof.
Can't you see me?

57:28.210 --> 57:30.146
<i>I have no visual
on the roof.</i>

57:38.554 --> 57:40.490
What the fuck is...

57:41.856 --> 57:43.960
Why is she...

57:51.166 --> 57:53.066
...with the shooters?

57:53.068 --> 57:54.735
Lazarus, what...

57:54.737 --> 57:55.738
I don't... I...

57:57.072 --> 57:59.940
<i>Go back to the door now.</i>

57:59.942 --> 58:02.175
Okay.

58:02.177 --> 58:04.814
Okay, okay.

58:21.195 --> 58:22.295
Nolan.

58:22.297 --> 58:24.264
Nolan, wake up.

58:24.266 --> 58:27.804
- What happened?
- You fainted.

58:32.007 --> 58:33.639
Stop it.

58:33.641 --> 58:35.608
What, am I not
good enough for you?

58:35.610 --> 58:39.579
It's the virus
trying to spread, right?

58:39.581 --> 58:41.617
Tell me, Kalie.

58:44.085 --> 58:45.521
I'm sorry.

58:52.628 --> 58:54.860
Lazarus!

58:54.862 --> 58:57.766
Hasn't been responding
since you passed out.

59:00.603 --> 59:02.005
Nolan!

59:05.074 --> 59:07.010
I just need a minute.

59:48.916 --> 59:50.717
I didn't know.

59:50.719 --> 59:52.052
I didn't know.

59:52.054 --> 59:54.222
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey, hey.

59:57.159 --> 59:59.959
We'll find the vaccine, okay?

59:59.961 --> 01:00:01.898
We'll find it.

01:00:11.005 --> 01:00:14.740
1-5-6-2-7-9-4.

01:00:14.742 --> 01:00:16.846
Try that. Try it.

01:00:33.762 --> 01:00:35.365
What do you see?

01:00:38.099 --> 01:00:40.766
How did you know?

01:00:40.768 --> 01:00:42.469
It's coming back.

01:00:42.471 --> 01:00:45.005
All of it. It's coming back.

01:00:45.007 --> 01:00:46.940
Okay, okay.

01:00:46.942 --> 01:00:48.878
Okay, where's the vial?

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:07.830
Okay.

01:01:29.284 --> 01:01:31.753
Okay, now we wait.

01:01:36.358 --> 01:01:39.028
You lied to me, didn't you?

01:01:40.295 --> 01:01:42.195
I didn't.

01:01:42.197 --> 01:01:44.800
Yeah, you did, Kalie.

01:01:51.539 --> 01:01:56.075
You said all the photos
were erased.

01:01:56.077 --> 01:01:57.510
Where did you find it?

01:01:57.512 --> 01:01:59.880
It doesn't matter.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:02.382
Lazarus must have
placed it here.

01:02:02.384 --> 01:02:05.318
Don't you get it?
She's playing with your mind.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.954
She doesn't want us
to cooperate.

01:02:08.956 --> 01:02:11.326
Tell me the truth, Kalie.

01:02:14.396 --> 01:02:17.063
You have to believe me.

01:02:17.065 --> 01:02:19.166
You and I both depend on it.

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:22.235
I just want the truth.

01:02:22.237 --> 01:02:24.373
Where is my wife?

01:02:27.409 --> 01:02:29.041
Right.

01:02:29.043 --> 01:02:31.880
Lazarus lied about that too.

01:02:34.248 --> 01:02:36.849
Said I had a wife
and a daughter.

01:02:36.851 --> 01:02:38.385
A family.

01:02:38.387 --> 01:02:42.188
Something that she knew
I've always wanted.

01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:46.428
She said she would harm them
if I didn't do what she said.

01:02:49.331 --> 01:02:54.133
Doesn't sound very smart.

01:02:54.135 --> 01:02:57.170
I know I have a wife.
I can feel it.

01:02:57.172 --> 01:03:01.874
And that feeling gets stronger
every single second.

01:03:01.876 --> 01:03:04.978
But I've never had a daughter.

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:07.347
My brain, maybe,

01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:11.117
or my soul would never
let me forget that.

01:03:11.119 --> 01:03:12.918
Never.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.088
Even this is a lie.

01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:18.191
The indentation
on my finger's

01:03:18.193 --> 01:03:20.863
twice as fat
as this piece of garbage.

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:15.215
Position confirmed.

01:04:15.217 --> 01:04:17.385
Lazarus is in there.

01:05:07.601 --> 01:05:10.239
Wes, it works.

01:05:13.675 --> 01:05:15.044
It works!

01:05:16.311 --> 01:05:18.077
It works!

01:05:18.079 --> 01:05:21.380
<i>You really think
we are that stupid?</i>

01:05:21.382 --> 01:05:22.518
Kalie.

01:05:24.052 --> 01:05:26.052
<i>You brought the virus in here</i>

01:05:26.054 --> 01:05:28.624
<i>and jeopardized
our only chance.</i>

01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:37.365
It's over.

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.103
Wait.

01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:44.706
I remember.

01:05:49.077 --> 01:05:54.014
I've always had it.
I just forgot where I put it.

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:55.447
Where?

01:05:55.449 --> 01:05:57.083
<i>Don't tell her.</i>

01:05:57.085 --> 01:06:00.619
Don't listen to Lazarus.
Tell me.

01:06:00.621 --> 01:06:04.025
<i>She is not
who she pretends to be.</i>

01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:09.632
No.

01:06:11.565 --> 01:06:13.034
The game is up.

01:06:15.403 --> 01:06:17.604
I remember where it is.

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:20.305
You can't threaten me anymore.

01:06:20.307 --> 01:06:21.807
I would never hurt you.

01:06:21.809 --> 01:06:23.443
<i>We are the only ones</i>

01:06:23.445 --> 01:06:26.045
<i>who know how to stop
the epidemic.</i>

01:06:26.047 --> 01:06:29.148
That's why we were running away,
Wes, I swear.

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:31.617
That's when we found out that
GenoCal started the epidemic

01:06:31.619 --> 01:06:35.755
to sell the vaccine
to the highest bidder.

01:06:35.757 --> 01:06:37.389
Lazarus?

01:06:37.391 --> 01:06:39.659
<i>Not true.</i>

01:06:39.661 --> 01:06:42.795
They shot at us.
You crashed the car.

01:06:42.797 --> 01:06:44.798
Don't you remember that?

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.800
The warehouse.

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:50.403
Was it in the warehouse?

01:06:50.405 --> 01:06:52.838
No, it wasn't
in the warehouse.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.208
They brought us here
when we were unconscious.

01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:57.209
Don't you realize
how ridiculous that sounds?

01:06:57.211 --> 01:06:58.545
Wes!

01:06:58.547 --> 01:07:01.581
<i>Kalie Jorgensen
is a foreign agent.</i>

01:07:01.583 --> 01:07:03.615
Stop it!

01:07:03.617 --> 01:07:07.653
She's lying,
and we're gonna die.

01:07:07.655 --> 01:07:10.425
<i>She will kill you
as soon as you find it.</i>

01:07:13.862 --> 01:07:16.298
I really wanna believe you.

01:07:17.798 --> 01:07:21.700
And I can't give you
a reason to, can I?

01:07:21.702 --> 01:07:23.570
Just go, Nolan.

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:25.438
Go by yourself.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.773
You don't even need to show me
where it is.

01:07:27.775 --> 01:07:31.112
Just...

01:07:33.447 --> 01:07:37.383
Just put a few CCs in this
at the bottom of the stairs,

01:07:37.385 --> 01:07:39.321
so I can live.

01:07:45.293 --> 01:07:49.162
Once you walk out that door,
it's over.

01:07:49.164 --> 01:07:51.200
You never have
to see me again.

01:07:57.539 --> 01:07:59.575
Nolan.

01:08:07.916 --> 01:08:09.883
<i>She is playing you, Wes.</i>

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:11.687
<i>Don't fall for it.</i>

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:17.292
Your daughter.

01:08:19.493 --> 01:08:20.563
No.

01:08:21.863 --> 01:08:24.233
I'd never forget a daughter.

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:41.481
<i>They are here.</i>

01:08:41.483 --> 01:08:43.482
What do plan to do with it?

01:08:43.484 --> 01:08:45.551
<i>They want to stop you.</i>

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.386
But not Kalie, right?

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:49.288
<i>I need to lock down
the facility.</i>

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:50.893
Could've told me that
a long time ago.

01:08:57.265 --> 01:08:59.264
Why'd you lie to me
about my family?

01:08:59.265 --> 01:09:00.368
<i>I'm not.</i>

01:09:05.273 --> 01:09:08.441
<i>They're going to kill me.</i>

01:09:08.443 --> 01:09:10.676
<i>I'm scared, Wes.</i>

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.479
Open the door!

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:29.261
Lazarus, open the door!

01:09:29.264 --> 01:09:31.763
If I don't get the vaccine,
no one gets it!

01:09:31.765 --> 01:09:33.732
Lazarus!

01:09:57.826 --> 01:10:00.026
- It's stuck.
- <i>I need you to stop them.</i>

01:10:00.028 --> 01:10:01.363
What?

01:10:03.731 --> 01:10:07.666
<i>They're going to destroy
all the hard work we have done.</i>

01:10:07.668 --> 01:10:09.270
Lazarus!

01:10:18.646 --> 01:10:23.516

Kalie.

01:13:59.667 --> 01:14:01.170
What the hell?

01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:25.092
All circuits are intact.

01:14:27.561 --> 01:14:30.966
It looks like Lazarus
resisted the radiations.

01:14:49.283 --> 01:14:51.717
I hope it worked.

01:14:51.719 --> 01:14:54.655
If only he could tell us
where the vaccine is.

01:15:03.331 --> 01:15:05.701
We don't have sound.

01:15:10.738 --> 01:15:12.941
<i>I need a password.
I can't...</i>

01:15:18.845 --> 01:15:20.345
<i>There's someone else here.</i>

01:15:20.347 --> 01:15:22.917
<i>Stop it! Calm...</i>

01:15:24.118 --> 01:15:25.687
<i>Wes.</i>

01:15:27.588 --> 01:15:30.623
You put yourself
in the program?

01:15:30.625 --> 01:15:33.025
I'm sorry.
I couldn't tell you.

01:15:33.027 --> 01:15:35.027
I'm the computer virus.

01:15:35.029 --> 01:15:37.996
I'm the glitch
that creates controversy,

01:15:37.998 --> 01:15:41.099
danger, doubt, and love.

01:15:41.101 --> 01:15:44.769
I put myself into the program
to make sure that Lazarus

01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:48.139
would perform to the maximum
of his abilities,

01:15:48.141 --> 01:15:53.548
to see if he would
remember something.

01:16:49.069 --> 01:16:51.303
<i>GenoCal started the epidemic
in order to sell the vaccine</i>

01:16:51.305 --> 01:16:53.104
<i>to the highest bidder.</i>

01:16:53.106 --> 01:16:55.676
<i>Do you realize
how ridiculous that sounds?</i>

01:16:57.244 --> 01:16:58.846
Wait, wait, slow down.

01:17:00.014 --> 01:17:01.213
Slow down.

01:17:01.215 --> 01:17:04.416
<i>I really wanna believe you.</i>

01:17:04.418 --> 01:17:08.754
<i>And I can't give you
a reason to, can I?</i>

01:17:08.756 --> 01:17:10.755
<i>Just go, Nolan.</i>

01:17:10.757 --> 01:17:12.357
<i>Go by yourself.</i>

01:17:12.359 --> 01:17:14.927
<i>You don't even need to show me
where it is.</i>

01:17:14.929 --> 01:17:16.297
<i>Just...</i>

01:17:19.966 --> 01:17:24.370
<i>Just put a few CCs in this
at the bottom of the stairs,</i>

01:17:24.372 --> 01:17:25.941
<i>so I can live.</i>

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:11.517
It's not his fault, Kalie.

01:18:11.519 --> 01:18:14.253
That part of him is dead.

01:18:14.255 --> 01:18:15.821
Just fast-forward.

01:18:27.201 --> 01:18:28.869
What the hell?

01:18:49.023 --> 01:18:51.257
My... We found it!

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:52.825
Where is it?

01:18:52.827 --> 01:18:54.226
In the car!

01:18:54.228 --> 01:18:56.995
We already searched the car.
Extensively.

01:18:56.997 --> 01:18:58.930
It's in the driver's seat.

01:18:58.932 --> 01:19:00.566
Should I disconnect Lazarus?

01:19:00.568 --> 01:19:02.034
Not yet.

01:19:02.036 --> 01:19:04.439
Not until Milton
finds the vaccine.

01:19:46.479 --> 01:19:48.415
Will you give me a moment?

01:19:49.984 --> 01:19:51.153
Sure.

01:20:06.266 --> 01:20:08.867
I know you can hear me.

01:20:08.869 --> 01:20:11.006
And you probably
want answers by now.

01:20:14.274 --> 01:20:16.008
We stole the vaccine

01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:19.477
when we found out what
GenoCal was gonna do with it.

01:20:19.479 --> 01:20:22.615
I don't know if the world
even knows what GenoCal is,

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:24.052
but I do.

01:20:30.925 --> 01:20:35.093
After the accident...

01:20:35.095 --> 01:20:38.897
you never recovered.

01:20:38.899 --> 01:20:41.532
You weren't dead,

01:20:41.534 --> 01:20:43.535
but you weren't alive,

01:20:43.537 --> 01:20:46.071
and the vaccine
was gone forever.

01:20:46.073 --> 01:20:49.208
That was until
GenoCal contacted me

01:20:49.210 --> 01:20:52.143
and asked me
to create Lazarus,

01:20:52.145 --> 01:20:56.648
a program that would jolt
your memory and record it.

01:20:56.650 --> 01:21:00.518
They figured only someone
who knew you as well I did

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:03.121
could complete this task.

01:21:03.123 --> 01:21:05.991
Since then, you'd been
wandering through a world

01:21:05.993 --> 01:21:08.192
that I've created for you.

01:21:08.194 --> 01:21:11.196
Every time you hit a dead end,

01:21:11.198 --> 01:21:14.400
it would reboot itself...

01:21:14.402 --> 01:21:17.702
until...

01:21:17.704 --> 01:21:20.041
until this moment.

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:42.327
Twelve days after GenoCal
moved you to a secret location,

01:21:42.329 --> 01:21:44.196
the big meltdown happened.

01:21:44.198 --> 01:21:46.331
The virus was set free,

01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:50.969
and the epidemic spread like
a tsunami all over the world.

01:21:50.971 --> 01:21:53.539
We needed the vaccine
more than ever.

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:56.107
But the GenoCal facility
was destroyed,

01:21:56.109 --> 01:21:59.280
and you and Lazarus were lost
until this morning.

01:22:13.426 --> 01:22:15.259
We gotta go now.

01:22:15.261 --> 01:22:17.064
No! He's here!

01:22:26.006 --> 01:22:28.710
I found out two days
before the crash.

01:22:31.511 --> 01:22:33.247
You named her Loni.

01:22:36.016 --> 01:22:39.019
It was the only time
you've ever seen me cry.

01:22:46.659 --> 01:22:49.697
I want her to be
everything like you.

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:29.561
- He's alive.
- He won't make it long, though.

01:24:29.563 --> 01:24:31.295
We can't leave him here.

01:24:31.297 --> 01:24:33.432
- What?
- We have to take him with us.

01:24:33.434 --> 01:24:35.334
We have to!

01:26:56.542 --> 01:26:58.410
<i>Oh, Wes.</i>

01:26:58.412 --> 01:27:00.911
<i>How romantic.</i>

01:27:00.913 --> 01:27:02.680
<i>A daughter?</i>

01:27:02.682 --> 01:27:05.416
<i>A wife who saves you?</i>

01:27:05.418 --> 01:27:07.718
<i>What else?</i>

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:11.857
<i>I've been programmed to know
you like happy endings.</i>

01:27:11.859 --> 01:27:14.492
<i>But that was a bit
over the top.</i>

01:27:14.494 --> 01:27:16.495
<i>Don't you think?</i>

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:18.729
<i>It's only you and I.</i>

01:27:18.731 --> 01:27:21.668
<i>You won't get out of here
until I get the vaccine.</i>

01:27:23.636 --> 01:27:25.670
<i>Therefore, I suggest...</i>

01:27:25.672 --> 01:27:28.809
<i>we start all over again.</i>

01:27:58.671 --> 01:28:03.671
