00:12.412 --> 00:14.481
I hate that you have
to work weekends.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.622
Off to fight
the bad guys, Daddy?

00:22.655 --> 00:23.823
Hi-ho, Silver.

01:19.446 --> 01:22.415
The explosion tore the cast-iron
casing of the pipe bomb

01:22.449 --> 01:26.419
into pieces no bigger
than eight millimeters.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.825
And it takes what we call

01:31.858 --> 01:33.493
to produce that level
of debasement.

01:33.526 --> 01:35.328
I-Is this speculation.

01:35.361 --> 01:36.496
No, sir.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.867
Through a series of
controlled detonations

01:40.900 --> 01:43.503
at my Arroyo Seco
testing facility,

01:43.536 --> 01:47.874
same blast pattern found

01:47.907 --> 01:49.542
in Inspector Raymond's driveway.

01:52.545 --> 01:55.748
I blew up junkers.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.689
That's a lot of effort
to go through.

02:02.722 --> 02:04.757
I wanted to leave
no room for doubt.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.594
I'm sick of leaders.

02:11.731 --> 02:14.400
Through meticulous
experimentation,

02:14.434 --> 02:18.505
I was able to identify
the exact fuel type used

02:18.538 --> 02:21.441
to bomb Inspector Raymond's car:

02:21.474 --> 02:26.246
Of the insoluble variety.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.585
Order. Order.

02:31.586 --> 02:32.886
No.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.888
(gavOrder. Order!

02:35.922 --> 02:39.926
Interesting.

02:39.959 --> 02:41.761
Not quite.

02:41.794 --> 02:47.500
Slight calculating mistake,
but...

02:47.534 --> 02:50.470
it is very promising work.

02:52.405 --> 02:53.840
Not yet.

02:53.873 --> 02:58.678
Shame Mr. Parsons
couldn't get the day off.

02:58.711 --> 03:02.982
It is his section
that raises the most questions,

03:03.016 --> 03:04.384
not surprisingly.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.619
His job is not the problem, sir.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.821
Jack actually decided
to volunteer.

03:13.927 --> 03:17.530
Um, he was summoned
to court this morning,

03:19.933 --> 03:21.443
He thought his work
would speak for itself.

03:21.467 --> 03:22.602
He's right about that.

03:22.635 --> 03:24.604
But look.

03:24.637 --> 03:28.541
Red fuming nitric acid
as oxidizer?

03:28.575 --> 03:30.310
I checked his equations.

03:30.343 --> 03:32.879
Can control the reaction.

03:32.912 --> 03:35.014
It's not volatility
I'm worried about.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.549
It's price.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.551
At projected burn rate,

03:38.585 --> 03:41.521
fuel will cost more
than prototype itself.

03:41.554 --> 03:45.325
Too bad he's not here
to make his case,

03:47.894 --> 03:50.830
two figs about that, sir.

03:50.863 --> 03:53.700
He just likes the title
that they gave him.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.535
What, "witness"?

03:55.568 --> 03:56.903
No, sir.

03:56.936 --> 03:58.571
"Expert."

04:01.975 --> 04:04.644
gentlemen.

04:04.677 --> 04:07.780
That's P-A-R-S-O-N-S.

04:09.616 --> 04:12.051
And I'm the head
of Caltech's first-ever.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.943
That's a heck of a parking job.

06:16.976 --> 06:18.511
We don't get to pick
our neighbors.

06:20.113 --> 06:23.182
Thank you for looking
after your sister.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.863
I remember you being
left alone even younger.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.856
Yes, "alone."

06:32.592 --> 06:36.896
I told you, Jeffrey was only
over to help with my schoolwork.

06:37.997 --> 06:42.535
She is too
naive for her own good.

06:46.205 --> 06:48.941
Well, I will be at

06:48.975 --> 06:50.853
the church retreat all weekend;
Here's the number

06:50.877 --> 06:52.145
if there's any problems.

06:52.178 --> 06:55.648
I-I could call the tow company.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.150
I'll take care of it.

06:57.183 --> 06:59.185
Have a blessed weekend.

07:32.885 --> 07:37.256
When I work, I need
something to move to.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.893
The whole driveway.

07:40.927 --> 07:42.895
My husband will be
coming home, and...

07:42.929 --> 07:44.163
Mrs. Parsons.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.766
I am so sorry about that.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.135
I made a real hash
of that parking job.

07:49.168 --> 07:51.170
Please, come inside.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.641
What'll you have?

07:55.675 --> 07:58.044
(door cloSorry?

07:58.077 --> 08:00.880
You're not one of those
temperance gals.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.849
No, it's just...

08:02.882 --> 08:05.051
of myself.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.053
Maggie Donovan.

08:07.086 --> 08:09.555
Ernest's wife?

08:09.589 --> 08:11.991
One and only, I hope.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.926
It's nice to meet you.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.628
And you.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.164
I feel like I owe you something

08:18.197 --> 08:20.933
for being so welcoming to
my Ernest while I've been away.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.169
He told me you made him
that banana bread?

08:23.202 --> 08:25.037
Yes.

08:25.071 --> 08:26.606
Do you know,
it was still sitting

08:26.639 --> 08:28.274
covered in mold.

08:29.742 --> 08:32.044
He is really too much sometimes.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.981
How about a glass of water?

08:36.215 --> 08:40.653
I work costumes at RKO Pictures.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.955
The movie studio?

08:42.989 --> 08:45.591
Have to bring my work.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.727
Here's that water.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.295
Now, tell me.

08:49.328 --> 08:52.164
Into the neighborhood?

08:56.168 --> 08:58.905
I'm-I'm sorry,

08:58.938 --> 09:01.207
My sister's
staying this weekend,

09:01.240 --> 09:04.644
not to leave her alone.

09:06.178 --> 09:08.814
Well, another time then.

09:15.121 --> 09:18.391
There must've been

09:18.424 --> 09:20.693
all shouting questions.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.362
And guess who introduced himself
to me outside the courtroom?

09:23.396 --> 09:25.364
Clifford Clinton.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.667
Mr. Civic himself.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.201
He shook my hand.

09:30.670 --> 09:31.771
Can you believe that?

09:31.804 --> 09:33.215
Should be in all
the papers tomorrow.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.775
That's great, Jack.

09:35.808 --> 09:38.377
Well, at least.

09:41.180 --> 09:43.349
Mrs. Donovan.

09:43.382 --> 09:45.885
You're kidding. She lives?

09:45.918 --> 09:51.157
Not only is she alive,
she's... not what you'd expect.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.159
What do you mean?

09:53.192 --> 09:56.262
She-she was friendly.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.930
Charming.

09:57.964 --> 10:01.701
Katharine Hepburn.

10:01.734 --> 10:04.270
Well, I'll be damned.

10:04.303 --> 10:05.972
It doesn't fit,
a woman like that

10:06.005 --> 10:07.707
being married
to a man like Ernest.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.176
Hey, you know, I didn't
just take this case

10:20.386 --> 10:22.788
Jack, we can't; Patty will hear.

10:22.822 --> 10:25.324
We can be quiet.

10:27.426 --> 10:31.063
Jack, listen to me,
I-I've been thinking...

10:31.097 --> 10:33.099
Jack.

10:36.802 --> 10:40.439
How long are you gonna
keep this up?

10:42.441 --> 10:45.778
We went to that...
thing, whatever it was.

10:45.811 --> 10:49.015
I feel like you're punishing me.

10:49.048 --> 10:51.050
I'm not.

10:53.486 --> 10:57.056
I realized you're right,
about having a baby.

10:57.089 --> 10:58.858
It would be too big
of a distraction,

10:58.891 --> 11:00.760
with everything else
you have going.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.137
Especially since your project
is still awaiting...

11:02.161 --> 11:03.481
We've just submitted
the proposal.

11:05.031 --> 11:08.300
I know, I... I just think
it makes sense to wait

11:08.334 --> 11:10.469
until things are
a little more certain.

11:12.271 --> 11:13.973
Okay.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.841
But we can still...

11:15.875 --> 11:17.810
We can't, actually.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.879
I'm pretty sure we can.

11:27.453 --> 11:29.488
You're gonna take
the words of a priest

11:29.522 --> 11:31.323
over the needs of your husband?

11:33.259 --> 11:36.896
I know it won't be easy,

12:19.872 --> 12:21.474
Nice costume.

12:21.507 --> 12:24.243
You might want to check
your calendar, though.

12:26.445 --> 12:29.014
Ha.

12:44.463 --> 12:48.968
Anyone happen to read the paper
this morning?

12:49.001 --> 12:50.569
We all saw it.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.872
That's some position
you gave yourself.

12:52.905 --> 12:54.373
The guy misquoted me.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.876
Fit in the caption.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.989
'Cause the picture they got
of you wasn't big enough.

13:00.179 --> 13:02.148
Rich.

13:02.181 --> 13:04.016
You don't really think
I'd forget about you.

13:04.049 --> 13:06.051
It's not just him you forgot.

13:06.085 --> 13:08.053
About the article.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.331
Mesulam had concerns
about the fuel,

13:09.355 --> 13:10.432
and you weren't there
to address them.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.458
Well, that's too bad,

13:12.491 --> 13:14.193
but I can't control.

13:14.226 --> 13:16.162
You didn't have
to testify at all.

13:16.195 --> 13:17.897
You could've been here,
focused on our work

13:17.930 --> 13:19.231
instead of chasing
the spotlight.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.033
You think I did this for me?

13:21.066 --> 13:22.601
Caltech can't very well
shut down

13:22.635 --> 13:25.404
our project now that it's
a matter of public record.

13:25.437 --> 13:26.906
Really? You did this.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.183
Think of the publicity
we're getting.

13:28.207 --> 13:29.975
Rocketry's mentioned
at least five times.

13:30.009 --> 13:31.944
Goddamn it, Jack!
You don't seem to understand...

13:31.977 --> 13:33.546
Gentlemen?

13:33.579 --> 13:35.414
Am I interrupting anything?

13:38.951 --> 13:41.220
To drop these off.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.396
I saw your picture.

13:50.429 --> 13:51.997
Very dramatic.

13:52.031 --> 13:53.308
Finally, someone appreciates it.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.633
Thank you, Alice.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.168
The professor wanted me
to emphasize

13:56.202 --> 13:57.445
that tomorrow's event
is black-tie.

13:57.469 --> 13:59.405
Nt?

14:01.006 --> 14:03.342
The Athenaeum?

14:05.377 --> 14:08.247
Is this Halloween
or April Fools'?

14:11.083 --> 14:14.053
And remember, dress to impress.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.259
Maybe Jack wasn't wrong
about the publicity.

14:24.296 --> 14:26.398
We made it, Rich.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.209
What the hell are we gonna wear?

14:39.545 --> 14:41.280
Well?

14:48.120 --> 14:49.464
Don't think of it
as your father's.

14:49.488 --> 14:52.358
He never put it to good use.
Think of it as the tuxedo

14:52.391 --> 14:55.060
your grandfather bought
so you could come into your own

14:55.094 --> 14:57.363
in the very same room
Einstein ate in.

15:01.567 --> 15:05.404
Il you if you
keep standing there gawking.

15:05.437 --> 15:06.514
Don't make the break too heavy.

15:06.538 --> 15:09.074
He's a scientist,
not a jazz man.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.344
Patty, how's it coming?

15:12.378 --> 15:13.746
I only used the sports page.

15:13.779 --> 15:15.648
Figure that's good
for half a size.

15:15.681 --> 15:17.182
Here you are, Johnny.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.318
Thanks, Patty.

15:19.351 --> 15:20.653
How does it feel, darling?

15:20.686 --> 15:22.564
I wish we'd had time to
get a professional tailor.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.990
No. Susan worked her magic.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.458
The only thing
that doesn't fit is

15:26.492 --> 15:27.636
that Marvel wore
something so nice.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.128
Marvel never filled this out.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.208
- I think he looks like Chaplin in.
- The Tramp.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.968
go get ready for dinner.

15:37.202 --> 15:38.570
Don't you listen to that girl.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.439
You look just like Clark Gable.

15:40.472 --> 15:41.540
Doesn't he, Susan?

15:41.573 --> 15:45.177
No, not like Clark Gable.

15:45.210 --> 15:48.981
He looks...
like the man of my dreams.

15:50.516 --> 15:53.519
Ruth, would you mind getting me
some more black thread?

15:53.552 --> 15:56.188
It should be on my sewing table.

15:56.221 --> 15:59.158
Of course.

16:10.235 --> 16:11.236
You okay?

16:13.539 --> 16:16.175
Remember, it's only dinner.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.552
You're not the one
giving the speech.

16:17.576 --> 16:19.478
I know.

16:19.511 --> 16:21.613
I just mean don't worry
about making waves.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.116
Just try and soak it all in.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.788
Here you are.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.225
Enough thread to mend
the Pope's vestments.

16:33.258 --> 16:36.028
Thank you.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.818
Quite a night to
keep me waiting.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.089
It's only our entire future.

17:05.124 --> 17:07.526
You didn't hear?

17:08.660 --> 17:10.162
We're under attack.

17:12.297 --> 17:16.234
Astronomers report continued gas
outbursts at regular intervals

17:16.268 --> 17:17.301
on the planet Mars.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.023
That the enemy
will be reinforced.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.208
There have been several attempts

17:23.242 --> 17:25.176
made to locate Professor Pierson
of Princeton,

17:25.210 --> 17:27.613
at close range.

17:27.646 --> 17:28.580
Did he say Martian?

17:28.614 --> 17:30.482
- It's Welles. He's doing.
- War of the Worlds,

17:30.516 --> 17:32.184
But he's playing it
completely straight.

17:32.217 --> 17:35.354
Scouting planes report
three Martian machines...

17:35.387 --> 17:36.947
Martians storm the Earth
the same night.

17:39.591 --> 17:41.627
Heat ray's
not in use, although...

17:41.660 --> 17:44.596
Too bad we can't be
in two places at once.

17:46.265 --> 17:49.535
And countryside.

17:56.175 --> 17:57.409
Looking sharp, fellas.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.378
You as well, fearless leader.

18:03.715 --> 18:06.151
This Zhongshan was hand-tailored

18:06.185 --> 18:07.753
in the Huangpu district
in Shanghai.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.521
Well, I guess I'll have to.

18:12.391 --> 18:15.260
After you, fellas.

18:15.294 --> 18:17.429
Hey, act like you belong.

18:30.476 --> 18:32.444
Told you I'd be back.

18:34.379 --> 18:37.216
Enjoy your evening, sir.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.655
How many Nobel Laureates
you think are here?

18:43.689 --> 18:47.392
I count at least two.

18:51.263 --> 18:52.831
There you are.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.500
You had us worried.

18:54.533 --> 18:55.710
Be on your best
behavior tonight.

18:55.734 --> 18:59.605
No mention of your
past transgressions.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.809
Professor Mesulam
hasn't told you?

19:03.842 --> 19:05.444
Where is he, Gilford?

19:05.477 --> 19:07.779
Here, Professors, thank you.

19:09.314 --> 19:12.484
I will explain.
But first, drinks.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.820
Thank you.

19:14.853 --> 19:17.422
Thanks.

19:21.426 --> 19:24.796
Over there is the
esteemed Herr Breitner.

19:24.830 --> 19:28.567
Don't all look at once.

19:32.437 --> 19:35.741
Finding Nazi regime
unaccommodating.

19:35.774 --> 19:38.544
Yes. F Breitner of the VfR?

19:38.577 --> 19:41.880
With Wernher von Braun.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.815
Which is why every
university in America.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.288
Seems like it's not
just the universities

19:49.321 --> 19:50.455
that are interested.

19:50.489 --> 19:53.625
I count at least two stars
on that major general's uniform.

19:54.893 --> 19:57.529
Due to growing
interest in field,

19:57.563 --> 19:59.665
and possibly new
sources of funding,

19:59.698 --> 20:02.467
administration felt it necessary

20:02.501 --> 20:07.039
to introduce our own.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.475
With respect, sir,

20:13.612 --> 20:17.449
Don't you get it?
We're show ponies

20:17.482 --> 20:19.585
being trotted out
to make this place look

20:19.618 --> 20:21.386
more cutting edge
than it really is.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.689
Not in the least. Ou?

20:23.722 --> 20:25.390
And since we're
so highly valued,

20:25.424 --> 20:27.993
maybe we can discuss.

20:28.026 --> 20:31.496
You have keen grasp
for politics, Mr. Parsons.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.499
Perhaps you
have learned something

20:34.533 --> 20:36.501
from time at City Hall.

20:38.036 --> 20:39.404
Cheers.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.406
Cheers.

20:44.009 --> 20:46.378
I'd hate to miss
the beginning of the talk.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.596
Pardon me, sir.

21:06.398 --> 21:08.634
I showed my invitation
at the door.

21:11.703 --> 21:13.372
This man is my guest.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.774
Those are the only
credentials he needs.

21:15.807 --> 21:19.778
I'm very sorry, Professor,
but we've received a complaint.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.016
Wait here.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.553
Gentlemen...

21:28.587 --> 21:29.988
You guys go ahead.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.923
Are you sure?

21:43.602 --> 21:46.805
He was touting himself as an
emissary of Caltech in the press

21:46.838 --> 21:48.473
and he's nothing of the sort.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.709
If we hope
to impress upon our guests

21:50.742 --> 21:52.778
that we are serious
about the field,

21:54.513 --> 21:56.381
giving them

21:56.415 --> 21:57.783
I'm not questioning you,
Provost.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.685
Professor?

21:59.718 --> 22:02.988
Jack, please, a moment.

22:03.021 --> 22:04.656
It won't help to make scene.

22:04.690 --> 22:06.124
I wasn't going to.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.561
Not with the proposal
under consideration.

22:15.067 --> 22:18.503
I may not be welcome
at the party,

22:18.537 --> 22:21.940
but that doesn't mean
I can't toe the party line.

22:33.051 --> 22:35.854
Jack? Wait.

22:35.887 --> 22:38.557
Come on, Richie.

22:38.590 --> 22:40.192
It wasn't so grand
in there, anyway.

22:40.225 --> 22:42.828
We can still catch
War of the Worlds.

22:42.861 --> 22:44.096
You're leaving?

22:44.129 --> 22:45.864
Yeah.

22:45.897 --> 22:48.433
Thought it'd be best
not to make any waves.

22:48.467 --> 22:50.869
Yeah.

22:50.902 --> 22:55.507
It's probably best,
for the project, I mean.

22:57.809 --> 23:00.946
Which is why I think.

23:02.514 --> 23:04.816
Breitner's work with
regenerative cooling

23:04.850 --> 23:06.852
could save us months.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.889
Yeah. Sure.

23:13.759 --> 23:15.894
Stay for the project.

23:15.927 --> 23:17.529
And like you said,

23:17.562 --> 23:19.698
there are two
huge events tonight.

23:19.731 --> 23:22.567
You can finish the end
of the Welles broadcast,

23:22.601 --> 23:25.570
and I can tell you
all about Breitner.

23:25.604 --> 23:27.873
Divide and conquer.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.577
Yep.

23:32.611 --> 23:34.946
Divide and conquer.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.516
Dinner is about
to be served, sir.

23:51.997 --> 23:54.800
Pouring in

23:54.833 --> 23:57.235
from Jersey marshes.
Reaches South Street.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.271
Gas masks useless.

23:59.304 --> 24:01.640
Urge population to move
into open spaces.

24:01.673 --> 24:05.744
23, 24.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.612
Avoid congested areas.

24:07.646 --> 24:10.615
Smoke now spreading

24:10.649 --> 24:12.717
2X2L, calling CQ.

24:12.751 --> 24:15.020
2X2L, calling CQ.

24:15.053 --> 24:18.657
2X2L, calling 8X3R.
Come in, please.

24:18.690 --> 24:21.693
Coming back at 2X2L.

24:21.726 --> 24:23.795
2X2L, we read you.

24:23.829 --> 24:26.031
The Martian tripods

24:26.064 --> 24:27.599
is under attack.

24:38.710 --> 24:42.113
It's a flying saucer.

25:09.975 --> 25:11.943
Here you go, mister.

25:17.616 --> 25:20.685
Poor sap thought
that broadcast was real.

25:20.719 --> 25:25.056
The world was ending.

25:29.761 --> 25:31.863
Who you supposed to be, anyhow?

25:32.998 --> 25:35.700
The costume.

25:35.734 --> 25:37.369
Costume?

26:03.028 --> 26:04.729
How does that look?

26:08.099 --> 26:10.101
Come over here.
Take a look for yourself.

26:13.838 --> 26:17.375
I suppose.

26:17.409 --> 26:20.078
Would you prefer
something different?

26:20.111 --> 26:22.013
No, this is fine.

26:22.047 --> 26:24.082
Just fine?

26:24.115 --> 26:27.652
It's great.

26:29.688 --> 26:31.222
All right.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.091
But can we talk
about the pictures?

26:35.994 --> 26:38.029
One of these doesn't belong.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.741
Donovan's.

26:53.278 --> 26:56.014
Who is this?

26:58.049 --> 26:59.351
I'm gonna hang up now.

26:59.384 --> 27:03.088
Ernest, wait. It's me.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.092
Sorry. Can't.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.827
The house tonight.

27:11.296 --> 27:14.265
Breaks all boundaries

27:14.299 --> 27:16.301
by his wife?

27:28.013 --> 27:29.881
Where are you?

27:31.883 --> 27:34.986
Stay put.

27:38.123 --> 27:40.025
You're going out?

27:40.058 --> 27:41.292
The neighbor.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.961
The scientist?

27:42.994 --> 27:44.514
Yeah, he sounded upset
about something.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.967
Should I have told him no?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.302
You don't need.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.438
You just have
to tell me the truth.

27:53.471 --> 27:56.007
And that is the truth.

27:56.041 --> 28:00.245
And when I get back, you and I
shall set up the bedroom.

28:10.155 --> 28:13.124
I had an invitation.
I had the tux.

28:13.158 --> 28:15.093
I looked the part.

28:15.126 --> 28:18.930
And they still called
me an interloper.

28:18.963 --> 28:22.133
You called it right
from the beginning.

28:24.135 --> 28:26.337
Somehow...

28:26.371 --> 28:31.009
you knew that they would
never accept me.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.911
If you just wanted
a shoulder to cry on,

28:32.944 --> 28:34.121
you could've gone home to Susan.

28:34.145 --> 28:36.881
No way.

28:36.915 --> 28:40.085
I can't face her.

28:40.118 --> 28:42.287
I didn't make any waves.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.223
Are you done? Said.

28:45.256 --> 28:47.358
No. Hey, come on. Sit down.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.027
Let's get another one, please.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.795
Coming up.

28:52.597 --> 28:57.402
You know what she said
to me before I left?

28:57.435 --> 29:01.206
That I looked like
the man of her dreams.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.208
What am I now?

29:03.241 --> 29:04.909
Drunk.

29:04.943 --> 29:08.179
Not drunk enough.

29:08.213 --> 29:10.181
You know, I-I got to go.

29:10.215 --> 29:12.217
I told Maggie I was
just having a beer, so...

29:14.152 --> 29:16.221
It's the devil's night.

29:16.254 --> 29:17.856
Let's let off some
steam. Come on.

29:17.889 --> 29:19.491
I'm sorry. I can't.

29:19.524 --> 29:21.426
Because your wife won't let you?

29:21.459 --> 29:23.128
It's more complicated than that.

29:23.161 --> 29:27.165
Yeah? What's so
complicated about it?

29:33.571 --> 29:35.306
At least not one
that wore the pants.

29:35.340 --> 29:37.542
Literally.

29:46.417 --> 29:50.188
But you're just as fucking.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.160
You want to go out?

30:02.467 --> 30:05.503
Let's go out.

30:07.305 --> 30:11.442
Try not to think too much.

30:11.476 --> 30:14.546
Herr Breitner, a moment, please.

30:14.579 --> 30:18.416
These are the young men,
we have been telling you about.

30:18.449 --> 30:21.219
The pioneering
rocketry team, is it?

30:21.252 --> 30:22.487
The honor is all ours,

30:22.520 --> 30:24.589
Herr Breitner.

30:24.622 --> 30:26.634
We have been following your work
not just through your papers

30:26.658 --> 30:28.426
but in correspondence

30:28.459 --> 30:31.129
with Herr von Braun himself.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.671
Yes.

30:39.704 --> 30:42.006
Um, I've-I've sought
his a-advice

30:42.040 --> 30:43.541
ever since I was a boy...

30:43.575 --> 30:46.244
Well, well, teenager, really.

30:46.277 --> 30:49.280
In-in fact, our prototype, um,

30:49.314 --> 30:52.350
borrows heavily from the
liquid propellant tests

30:52.383 --> 30:54.152
that you did with Von Braun.

30:54.185 --> 30:57.956
Well, let's hope this prototype
of yours is more impressive

30:57.989 --> 31:00.091
than your choice of pen friends.

31:00.124 --> 31:03.528
Yes. I-I-I hope so, too.

31:03.561 --> 31:06.231
Though, compared
to your work that you did

31:06.264 --> 31:08.233
at the Hochschule Berlin,
it's peanuts.

31:08.266 --> 31:11.302
I mean, there is promise.

31:11.336 --> 31:14.038
But that-that's really for.

31:15.273 --> 31:16.941
You haven't built it?

31:19.010 --> 31:22.046
I was led to believe that.

31:22.080 --> 31:24.949
The boy is being modest.

31:24.983 --> 31:27.518
The fact is, the rocketry team

31:27.552 --> 31:29.387
just had their
prototype approved.

31:29.420 --> 31:33.391
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we have a reception

31:33.424 --> 31:35.159
at the president's house
to attend.

31:35.193 --> 31:38.162
Come.

31:38.196 --> 31:40.365
Excuse me.

31:44.202 --> 31:47.705
It appears,
in order to save face,

31:47.739 --> 31:52.644
you get to build yourself
a rocket.

31:57.048 --> 31:59.317
As I set down
these notes on paper,

31:59.350 --> 32:02.687
I'm obsessed by the thought that
I may be the last living man...

32:05.723 --> 32:08.126
If you're bored, we can
play a different game.

32:08.159 --> 32:09.994
No, this game's fine.

32:12.363 --> 32:14.098
Trick or treat.

32:14.132 --> 32:16.067
In the world

32:16.100 --> 32:19.037
now seems part of another life,

32:19.070 --> 32:21.406
with the present,

32:21.439 --> 32:24.042
furtive existence
of the lonely derelict...

32:26.477 --> 32:28.646
Here. Some caramels.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.281
NHey.

32:30.315 --> 32:32.450
BHey. Come on!

32:32.483 --> 32:33.584
Hey, what are you doing?

32:35.086 --> 32:37.221
Come on! Le shits!

32:37.255 --> 32:40.158
You didn't even give her
a chance to pay you off!

32:42.226 --> 32:45.363
You see, this is why.

32:45.396 --> 32:47.999
It's cheaper than candy
and more effective.

32:49.834 --> 32:51.669
Here. Get out of harm's way.

32:57.675 --> 33:00.144
Thank you.

33:00.178 --> 33:02.146
Don't mention it.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.549
Halloween sure brings out
the worst in people.

33:04.582 --> 33:06.117
Especially in this neighborhood.

33:11.456 --> 33:12.790
It's really not that bad.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.093
Well, it can't be.

33:15.126 --> 33:16.728
You all live here.

33:23.101 --> 33:25.703
That Ernest is becoming friends
with a man like Jack.

33:25.737 --> 33:28.106
What do you mean?

33:28.139 --> 33:31.075
Well, Jack is a lot
more, um, upstanding

33:31.109 --> 33:33.678
than most of the guys
he socializes with.

33:33.711 --> 33:36.581
Although they've picked a hell
of a night to go out drinking.

33:36.614 --> 33:40.852
But he... he can't
be with my Jack.

33:40.885 --> 33:43.721
Jack's got an important
event at the university.

33:43.755 --> 33:47.792
Well...

33:47.825 --> 33:49.394
I wouldn't worry.

33:49.427 --> 33:51.596
If anybody was lying,
it would be my Ernest.

33:51.629 --> 33:53.398
Of course,
he doesn't call it lying.

33:53.431 --> 33:56.100
He calls it
living his own truth.

34:00.138 --> 34:02.707
Well, that just about does it.

34:05.209 --> 34:07.311
I don't see any
mess left. Do you?

34:09.714 --> 34:12.850
If anyone tries any more

34:24.429 --> 34:26.264
Patty?

35:04.869 --> 35:06.137
Patty!

35:14.912 --> 35:16.647
Did you put them up to this?

35:18.683 --> 35:19.917
What is wrong with you?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.219
What is wrong with

35:21.220 --> 35:22.487
you?

35:37.401 --> 35:39.203
Is this what you had in mind?

36:06.497 --> 36:08.933
Jack?

36:12.270 --> 36:14.939
Jack's not with you?

36:14.972 --> 36:17.608
I just assumed
that he would be here.

36:17.642 --> 36:20.344
Did he go out again?

36:20.378 --> 36:22.246
He never came home, Richard.

36:22.280 --> 36:23.748
He was meant to be with you.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.420
What happened? Cross, um...

36:37.995 --> 36:41.566
Turned out to be a
Caltech-only event.

36:41.599 --> 36:45.469
They invited him
only to turn him away?

36:47.605 --> 36:50.508
Why? It's so awful.

36:50.541 --> 36:53.344
I don't know.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.479
Politics?

36:57.815 --> 37:00.384
I couldn't leave with him.

37:00.418 --> 37:04.388
Important that I be there.

37:04.422 --> 37:06.490
I'm sure.

37:09.961 --> 37:13.898
I'm sorry. I-I don't know
where he went after.

37:13.931 --> 37:16.867
It's okay. I think I might.

37:20.504 --> 37:22.640
Thank you
for stopping by, Richard.

37:22.673 --> 37:26.344
I-I really hope that

37:26.377 --> 37:30.715
Jack has had a really
tough time up there.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.852
Hey. Come on, Richard.

37:34.885 --> 37:37.788
Bars are closing.

37:37.822 --> 37:40.591
Hey, um, tell him
that I-I stopped by

37:40.625 --> 37:43.361
to share the good news.
That'll cheer him up.

37:43.394 --> 37:45.596
What good news?

37:45.630 --> 37:47.732
Didn't I say?

37:47.765 --> 37:49.367
No, you didn't.

37:51.869 --> 37:55.072
We've been approved
the prototype.

37:55.106 --> 37:59.443
Just like Jack said.

38:09.053 --> 38:12.690
Women are suckers
for a well-dressed man.

38:12.723 --> 38:16.827
Easiest way to fool them.

38:16.861 --> 38:19.697
Joke's on them.

38:28.706 --> 38:31.942
I don't have any money, but I've
got this old betting slip.

38:31.976 --> 38:35.446
Never know. The horse
might've come in.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.884
I've never seen death
look so beautiful,

38:39.917 --> 38:43.754
except the gal
at that mass of yours.

38:43.788 --> 38:45.990
You mean the one
you ran away from?

38:46.023 --> 38:48.693
You gonna run away
again tonight?

38:48.726 --> 38:50.461
Wasn't planning on it.

38:50.494 --> 38:53.564
Good, 'cause...

38:53.597 --> 38:55.132
we're not here just to watch.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.670
Don't worry. I'll
lend you the money.

39:02.873 --> 39:04.642
I'm happily married.

39:10.781 --> 39:14.919
You got a taste of something
at the lodge and you want more.

39:14.952 --> 39:19.724
So, are you going to step up...

39:19.757 --> 39:21.692
or are you gonna
show yourself out

39:21.726 --> 39:24.061
like you did earlier tonight?

39:30.067 --> 39:32.570
Go home to your wife, Jack.

39:38.609 --> 39:40.611
Hold on.

40:13.144 --> 40:14.745
See you on the other side.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.568
All right. Yeah.

40:50.781 --> 40:52.016
What's the matter,

40:52.017 --> 40:53.250
corazón?

40:53.284 --> 40:55.152
I'm over here.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.261
So you like to watch.

41:09.166 --> 41:11.002
Dios mío,

41:11.003 --> 41:12.837
someone's at attention.

41:12.870 --> 41:15.639
Who got you all worked up?

41:15.673 --> 41:16.907
Was it Shirley?

41:16.941 --> 41:18.075
Or your friend?

41:19.243 --> 41:20.945
It's okay.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.947
We get you type of guys in here
all the time.

41:22.980 --> 41:25.716
What type of guy?

41:25.749 --> 41:27.651
Jesus.

41:27.685 --> 41:29.286
Just tell me what type of,

41:29.320 --> 41:30.921
(bellCarlos!

41:30.955 --> 41:32.823
Ayu - Tell me!

41:32.857 --> 41:35.659
Tell me what kind of guy
you think I am.

41:35.693 --> 41:37.328
Back off, pal.

41:46.136 --> 41:48.973
off of me!

41:49.006 --> 41:51.742
You take your hands off of me!

41:51.775 --> 41:54.612
Take your hands off of me!

42:15.232 --> 42:17.768
Was that the same boy
Virgil caught you with?

42:20.804 --> 42:22.373
You can talk to me.

42:22.406 --> 42:23.874
I'm not Virgil.

42:23.908 --> 42:25.743
No, you're just his spy.

42:25.776 --> 42:27.878
Is that what you think?

42:27.912 --> 42:30.681
I think you're gonna tell on me,
so, yeah, I do.

42:32.683 --> 42:33.951
Are you kidding?

42:33.984 --> 42:36.353
At home?

42:36.387 --> 42:37.888
You were a child.

42:39.256 --> 42:41.725
It wasn't.

42:43.093 --> 42:44.728
The same boy.

42:44.762 --> 42:47.398
Patty.

42:47.431 --> 42:48.966
What?

42:48.999 --> 42:51.135
I-I don't want to tell Virgil,

42:51.168 --> 42:53.904
but this really isn't
appropriate behavior.

42:53.938 --> 42:56.707
No wonder Jack
stayed out so late.

42:56.740 --> 42:59.076
He wouldn't have had any fun
here, that's for sure.

42:59.109 --> 43:00.411
You don't know.

43:00.444 --> 43:01.779
You're just a bratty
little girl.

43:01.812 --> 43:04.014
See?

43:10.821 --> 43:13.857
I just...

43:13.891 --> 43:16.727
I care about you.

43:19.730 --> 43:23.701
Now you really do
sound like Daddy.

43:42.853 --> 43:45.389
No one else has to
know about tonight.

43:49.026 --> 43:52.329
So much to drink.

45:26.423 --> 45:28.192
Yeah.

45:28.225 --> 45:30.527
It was something else.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.129
I know.

45:34.131 --> 45:36.033
Richard stopped by.

45:37.868 --> 45:40.404
Yeah?

45:40.437 --> 45:44.274
What did he say?

45:44.308 --> 45:46.176
That your proposal
had been approved.

45:50.981 --> 45:53.117
That's unbelievable.

46:10.167 --> 46:13.537
He was over the moon.

46:13.570 --> 46:16.306
I wish you'd been
here to hear it.

46:16.340 --> 46:20.010
Yeah, I do, too.

46:27.184 --> 46:30.020
I'm so proud of you.

46:48.505 --> 46:50.541
It's me.

46:50.574 --> 46:53.443
Frater E.D.

46:53.477 --> 46:56.513
I need to see him.

46:56.547 --> 46:59.049
I'm impossible.

46:59.082 --> 47:00.551
Just when it seemed like

47:00.584 --> 47:01.985
what we could do for him, wham!

47:02.019 --> 47:03.196
He acts like it's all
some big mistake,

47:03.220 --> 47:04.988
blaming it on the goddamn booze.

47:05.022 --> 47:10.294
You didn't wake me up to tell me
about a failed recruitment.

47:10.327 --> 47:13.664
You're here for you.

47:13.697 --> 47:16.667
Now, remember, stay
as still as possible

47:16.700 --> 47:20.070
and talk only about yourself.

47:20.103 --> 47:23.640
I'm angry.

47:23.674 --> 47:26.376
I lost control.

47:26.410 --> 47:29.213
I am...

47:34.551 --> 47:36.587
I am...

47:40.624 --> 47:43.193
I don't know what I am.

47:44.461 --> 47:47.931
With this man

47:47.965 --> 47:49.499
have brought nothing
but frustration,

47:49.533 --> 47:53.170
yet the camera tells
a different story.

47:53.203 --> 47:55.305
Do you think it's a coincidence

47:55.339 --> 47:58.075
that you experienced this
intense anger towards him

47:58.108 --> 48:00.410
the same week
your wife returns home?

48:00.444 --> 48:02.279
Maggie accepts
what I do here now.

48:02.312 --> 48:06.116
This is not about her.

48:06.149 --> 48:07.584
What is it about?

48:07.618 --> 48:09.119
Every time I try
to help the guy,

48:13.590 --> 48:16.627
is dictated by your will.

48:16.660 --> 48:20.564
The real question then is.

48:22.633 --> 48:25.335
Because I don't.

48:25.369 --> 48:28.405
I-I don't believe in putting
a label on desire.

48:28.438 --> 48:30.607
Thelema teaches us
to look beyond

48:30.641 --> 48:35.312
such restrictive categorization.

48:41.318 --> 48:47.157
Each person we love is
a different-shaped key.

48:47.190 --> 48:49.226
Each key...

48:49.259 --> 48:51.128
unlocks a different part of us,

49:01.605 --> 49:07.110
to me to be like water,

49:07.144 --> 49:11.348
constantly changing,

49:14.651 --> 49:17.154
are drawn to this man,

49:17.187 --> 49:21.224
it is to play with fire?

49:21.258 --> 49:25.595
Your anger at him
belies something more...

49:25.629 --> 49:27.597
essential.

49:27.631 --> 49:30.033
As the Master Therion tells us,

49:30.067 --> 49:33.470
all our suffering arises
from the great schism

49:33.503 --> 49:38.642
between two primary
forces of existence:

49:38.675 --> 49:41.778
Male, female,

49:41.812 --> 49:47.150
the dark, light.

49:47.184 --> 49:51.054
It is only in the union

49:51.088 --> 49:53.657
of our opposites

49:53.690 --> 49:58.695
that we are freed from.

50:01.765 --> 50:05.569
I believe you have found
far more in Mr. Parsons

50:05.602 --> 50:07.404
than an acolyte.

50:15.479 --> 50:18.715
I believe you've found...

50:18.749 --> 50:20.684
your liberation.
