01:09.471 --> 01:10.597
[Kimmy screams]

01:10.681 --> 01:11.765
[Fernando screams]

01:11.849 --> 01:13.642
Fernando, get up.

01:13.851 --> 01:16.436
I gotta get you out
without anyone seeing you.

01:16.645 --> 01:20.273
Why? We are still technically married.

01:21.567 --> 01:23.652
We fell asleep watching a movie.

01:23.736 --> 01:25.987
What's more married than that?

01:27.322 --> 01:29.950
Let's just tell the world
we're back together.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.660
We are not back together.

01:31.744 --> 01:35.622
We are secretly contemplating
considering mulling over the possibility

01:35.706 --> 01:38.417
of maybe getting back together-ish.

01:39.585 --> 01:44.130
If that's how you feel, then, yes,
we should keep this a secret from Ramona.

01:44.339 --> 01:46.466
How are we gonna sneak you out of here?

01:46.550 --> 01:49.261
I will simply climb out the window.

01:50.596 --> 01:54.266
-We're on the third floor.
-That's nothing.

01:54.474 --> 01:57.644
One time I escaped
from a hotel rooftop in Barcelona

01:57.728 --> 02:00.146
wearing nothing but a matador's cap.

02:01.941 --> 02:03.943
And not on my head.

02:12.743 --> 02:15.120
Cosmo, no!

02:15.328 --> 02:17.456
[Jackson] Mom's gonna go ballistic.

02:17.664 --> 02:19.875
Mom's not gonna know. I can fix this.

02:20.083 --> 02:23.837
All I need is Scotch Tape
and some blue and white crayons.

02:25.005 --> 02:26.381
You're dreaming, kid.

02:26.465 --> 02:29.676
If you want to keep Cosmo out of trouble,
you gotta lie.

02:29.885 --> 02:32.304
I've never told a lie in my life.

02:32.512 --> 02:34.723
Oh, it's easy. How was your day today?

02:34.932 --> 02:36.767
Not so good.

02:39.519 --> 02:42.856
Okay, now, when I ask you again,
tell me it was awesome

02:42.940 --> 02:44.316
and say it like you mean it.

02:44.399 --> 02:46.860
-How was your day today?
-It was awesome!

02:46.944 --> 02:50.739
My friend, welcome
to the wonderful world of lying.

02:52.198 --> 02:54.534
This doesn't feel right.

02:54.618 --> 02:57.162
I'm lying! This feels great!

03:09.633 --> 03:11.551
Sorry, Tommy.

03:11.635 --> 03:12.928
Don't say a word.

03:13.136 --> 03:15.597
Lucky for me, you don't know a word.

03:19.059 --> 03:23.229
Max, your granola's getting--
What happened to the couch?

03:24.023 --> 03:25.691
Cosmo!

03:25.899 --> 03:29.736
Why are you blaming Cosmo?
What about Tommy?

03:31.154 --> 03:33.782
Right. Tommy chewed up the couch.

03:33.991 --> 03:37.953
I know it sounds crazy,
but let's keep an open mind.

03:40.747 --> 03:45.335
Well, well, well. What have we here?

03:46.127 --> 03:49.006
Evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.

03:50.382 --> 03:53.385
Well, I guess I'll just have
to take Tommy to the orphanage.

03:53.969 --> 03:56.763
Can't you just take away
his animal crackers?

03:57.305 --> 03:59.058
We'll talk about this later.

04:00.392 --> 04:02.686
And you better get a blanket
to cover that up.

04:02.895 --> 04:06.648
And just know that lies have a way
of coming back to haunt you.

04:10.318 --> 04:13.113
I'm not scared.
This lying thing really works.

04:13.321 --> 04:16.199
-I'm not in trouble and neither are you.
-[barks]

04:19.661 --> 04:22.664
And you owe me, pal.
I saved you from the orphanage.

04:28.045 --> 04:30.380
-Good morning, everybody.
-Morning!

04:30.589 --> 04:34.467
[stammers] I have something
very important to tell you.

04:34.676 --> 04:37.721
All eyes on me right now. Yes.

04:39.765 --> 04:43.268
I have a deep, dark secret
that affects everyone in this room.

04:43.476 --> 04:46.521
The truth is I didn't shave my legs today!

04:47.647 --> 04:49.066
[Fernando grunts]

04:49.149 --> 04:53.445
-What was that noise?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Still confessing, hi.

04:53.653 --> 04:56.823
I also... didn't shave my legs yesterday.

04:58.867 --> 05:01.286
Phew! Glad I got that off my chest.

05:02.121 --> 05:03.204
I'm not.

05:04.706 --> 05:06.833
Get ready.
Your dad's coming to pick you up.

05:07.042 --> 05:09.920
-He's always late.
-I have a feeling he won't be today.

05:11.212 --> 05:12.422
Good morning!

05:15.884 --> 05:19.096
Lovely to see you all
for the first time today.

05:21.556 --> 05:24.309
I just dropped by to pick up Ramona.

05:24.392 --> 05:27.896
I did not literally drop, of course.

05:27.980 --> 05:33.485
If I had dropped, I would have to be on
the roof and why would I be on the roof?

05:33.568 --> 05:35.654
And by the way, here's your Frisbee.

05:39.282 --> 05:42.368
-Papa, what are we doing today?
-We're going to the zoo.

05:43.328 --> 05:44.830
I'm not a little kid anymore.

05:44.913 --> 05:48.374
So no more zoo, no more American
Girl store, no more Build-A-Bear--

05:48.583 --> 05:49.626
Whoa!

05:52.004 --> 05:55.132
I can live without the zoo and the bears.

05:56.008 --> 05:58.343
But the American Girl store?

06:01.304 --> 06:05.851
They're not just dolls.
They're heroes with emotional stories.

06:08.187 --> 06:09.521
[doorbell ringing]

06:09.604 --> 06:12.482
-I know who that is.
-Me, too. Come on, everybody.

06:12.691 --> 06:16.862
Fernando, maybe you can find something
a little more grown-up to do.

06:16.945 --> 06:19.990
I want my nose pierced,
a bellybutton ring and a tongue stud.

06:20.199 --> 06:21.992
You know what? Take her to the zoo.

06:22.659 --> 06:23.618
Bye.

06:25.578 --> 06:27.831
-Hey, everybody!
-Hi!

06:27.914 --> 06:30.542
-Grandpa!
-Hi!

06:31.960 --> 06:34.129
-Hi.
-Hey, grandkids, hi.

06:36.381 --> 06:39.384
Dad, you don't have to ring the doorbell.
It is your house.

06:39.592 --> 06:42.971
I wasn't ringing it,
I was, uh, cleaning it.

06:44.556 --> 06:47.851
Either way, thank you
for not just barging into my home.

06:48.060 --> 06:50.812
Yeah. I hate people who do that.

06:52.313 --> 06:54.482
Dad, it's so great to see you again.

06:54.691 --> 06:56.235
This worked out so great.

06:56.317 --> 06:58.653
I get to hang out
with everybody for a whole day,

06:58.737 --> 07:01.198
before my <i>Wake Up, San Francisco</i>
reunion show.

07:01.406 --> 07:05.744
Isn't it kinda sad when they drag out
the old cast for some lame reunion show?

07:13.043 --> 07:18.423
Not when the show is adored by millions
and the stars are beloved cultural icons.

07:22.261 --> 07:24.096
Grandpa, did you bring us anything?

07:25.138 --> 07:27.557
Your present is seeing your grandpa.

07:27.766 --> 07:31.394
But it'd be more of a present,
if he had real presents.

07:31.603 --> 07:33.688
Alright, how about some cold hard cash?

07:34.522 --> 07:36.316
Alright, here's five bucks for you.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.484
-Yeah!
-[Danny] Five bucks for you.

07:38.568 --> 07:39.903
Cool!

07:42.822 --> 07:44.283
You really need five bucks?

07:44.490 --> 07:46.576
I wouldn't be standing here if I didn't.

07:47.953 --> 07:49.329
I am so proud of you.

07:50.789 --> 07:54.167
This place looks great. It's so nice.

07:54.251 --> 07:55.543
It-- Wha--

07:56.253 --> 07:59.798
What is an upstairs blanket
doing on a downstairs couch?

08:00.506 --> 08:03.051
Dad, there is
a perfectly good reason for it.

08:03.260 --> 08:05.262
Okay, no, you don't wanna do that!

08:09.515 --> 08:10.934
What happened to my couch?

08:11.143 --> 08:16.022
Cosmo happened. But don't worry, we
are having the whole couch reupholstered.

08:16.231 --> 08:20.777
Reupholstered?
This couch is a classic antique.

08:21.778 --> 08:25.365
All of our family memories
are encrusted into it.

08:25.782 --> 08:28.618
Let it go, Dad.
You can't hold onto the past.

08:29.911 --> 08:32.455
Unless that past isn't really the past.

08:32.538 --> 08:34.957
Sometimes the past can be your future.

08:35.041 --> 08:36.708
Just like this couch.

08:36.793 --> 08:39.921
It's familiar. It's comfortable.

08:40.005 --> 08:41.923
It loves you.

08:42.131 --> 08:44.343
Maybe it deserves a second chance.

08:47.971 --> 08:51.141
I had no idea she felt so strongly
about this couch.

08:51.975 --> 08:54.353
Why can't you girls
be more like Kimmy Gibbler?

09:01.734 --> 09:03.611
Cosmo does lots of tricks.

09:03.695 --> 09:04.946
Cosmo, beg.

09:06.489 --> 09:08.867
Cosmo, roll over.

09:11.077 --> 09:13.163
Cosmo, do nothing.

09:16.416 --> 09:18.710
We really worked on that one.

09:19.502 --> 09:21.421
That's nothing.

09:21.504 --> 09:26.634
My dad taught our dog
to open the fridge and bring him a beer.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.971
Your dad sounds like a boozer.

09:34.184 --> 09:35.643
He's a cool airline pilot.

09:35.852 --> 09:36.895
[boys gasp]

09:39.480 --> 09:41.191
Well, my dad was a fireman.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.152
That's him and my brother on a firetruck.

09:44.361 --> 09:46.112
[boy] Big deal.

09:46.321 --> 09:51.492
Once, my dad let me sit
in the pilot seat of a 787.

09:51.701 --> 09:53.203
Ooh!

09:53.412 --> 09:56.748
Well, I can ride on a firetruck
whenever I want,

09:56.831 --> 09:59.292
even if it's just to go pick up a pizza.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.211
Ooh!

10:01.420 --> 10:02.921
Stop "ooh"ing.

10:03.004 --> 10:05.382
-He's lying.
-Am not!

10:05.590 --> 10:08.051
Bring a firetruck
to my birthday party tomorrow.

10:08.260 --> 10:10.345
Maybe I will. And guess what?

10:10.429 --> 10:12.305
Everybody's gonna get a ride on it.

10:12.513 --> 10:14.140
[cheering]

10:15.100 --> 10:19.187
That is going to make your bouncy castle
look pretty pathetic.

10:21.981 --> 10:24.650
[camera clicking]

10:29.530 --> 10:33.326
Dad, tell me you're not taking selfies
of you and the couch.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.622
No, I just, uh... Okay, yes, I was.

10:38.457 --> 10:41.293
Would you get one of me
and the whole couch together?

10:42.752 --> 10:45.130
-Just one.
-Sure, okay. Alright.

10:46.506 --> 10:48.091
[camera clicking]

10:49.134 --> 10:50.302
Thanks.

10:50.510 --> 10:53.763
The upholsterers
are taking the couch away in an hour.

10:53.972 --> 10:55.723
This couch has so many memories.

10:55.932 --> 10:57.725
How many dates did you come home from

10:57.809 --> 11:00.686
to find me sitting right here
waiting for you?

11:00.895 --> 11:05.275
All of them? I never did get
a kiss goodbye at the front door.

11:05.484 --> 11:07.610
Good. My plan worked.

11:08.528 --> 11:10.571
Not really. We made out in the car.

11:11.406 --> 11:14.409
One time on the couch
me and David Cantone--

11:14.493 --> 11:16.577
Do not finish this story.

11:17.620 --> 11:21.333
This is a good, decent couch.
Suitable for the whole family.

11:21.958 --> 11:25.086
What?
We just watched <i>Gremlins 2</i> , buck naked.

11:27.255 --> 11:29.132
I'm kidding.

11:29.341 --> 11:32.385
I never liked that kid.
He never used a coaster.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.848
Dad, I have to work late tonight.

11:37.056 --> 11:39.434
Matt and I are doing inventory.

11:39.642 --> 11:43.604
Who's Matt? And why did your face light up
just now when you said his name?

11:44.730 --> 11:46.607
Oh, he's a new vet at the clinic.

11:46.816 --> 11:49.152
-I'll see you later.
-Alright.

11:50.611 --> 11:53.532
Can I ask you something semi-related
to the Matt thing?

11:53.614 --> 11:54.615
Sure.

11:54.824 --> 11:57.952
How did you know you were ready
to start dating after Mom died?

11:58.703 --> 12:01.039
I just sort of knew.

12:01.122 --> 12:04.834
I think what you want to do is
list the pros and cons of dating Matt.

12:05.502 --> 12:08.004
Well, there's plenty of cons.

12:08.087 --> 12:10.423
I mean, Matt's my boss's son.

12:10.507 --> 12:14.635
He's only in town temporarily. Plus, I
don't know how the boys would handle it.

12:14.844 --> 12:16.221
What about the pros?

12:17.930 --> 12:19.599
I kinda like him.

12:21.184 --> 12:23.019
That's a pretty big pro.

12:24.229 --> 12:28.274
Well, I think if it feels right,
go for it.

12:28.483 --> 12:30.360
-Thanks, Dad.
-Love you.

12:31.486 --> 12:36.199
Do you think we could've had a talk like
that on a couch covered in new upholstery?

12:41.454 --> 12:43.081
I don't think so.

12:44.999 --> 12:46.501
Hey, pal.

12:46.585 --> 12:48.545
I've got a bone to pick with you.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.464
I took your advice about lying

12:51.631 --> 12:54.509
and now I need a firetruck
at Taylor's party tomorrow.

12:54.717 --> 12:57.762
Why would you say a dumb thing like that?

12:57.970 --> 13:00.723
I took your advice about lying.

13:00.806 --> 13:02.892
Try to keep up.

13:04.143 --> 13:08.814
I showed 'em the picture of you and Dad
on the firetruck and it just popped out.

13:10.149 --> 13:13.403
It's not fair!
I never got a ride with Dad.

13:15.572 --> 13:17.365
You know, if Dad was here,

13:17.574 --> 13:21.160
he would have totally gotten you
a firetruck for Taylor's birthday.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.623
And you know what?
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

13:24.830 --> 13:28.042
Really? What a great big brother!

13:31.254 --> 13:33.839
-What are you gonna do?
-I have no idea.

13:35.634 --> 13:39.929
Well, please come up with something
or all my friends are gonna hate me.

13:40.721 --> 13:43.015
But no pressure.

13:47.353 --> 13:49.188
Thanks for driving us, Grandpa.

13:49.272 --> 13:52.233
Well, your mom's stuck at work.
It's lucky I'm here.

13:52.442 --> 13:55.111
Alright, let's get Max a ride
on that firetruck.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.447
Are you ready with the cute face, Max?

13:57.656 --> 14:00.116
This face was born ready.

14:01.242 --> 14:03.911
Should I go with "Christmas morning"?

14:06.623 --> 14:09.167
Or "bedtime already?"

14:12.044 --> 14:15.131
-Hey, aren't you Tommy Fuller's kids?
-Yeah.

14:15.340 --> 14:19.135
-I'm sorry about your dad.
-Thanks. Is Chief Thompson around?

14:19.344 --> 14:20.428
He's retired.

14:20.637 --> 14:23.348
That's the new chief, Mulrooney.

14:27.268 --> 14:30.188
Hi. I'm Jackson
and this is my brother, Max.

14:30.271 --> 14:31.397
Now, Max.

14:34.775 --> 14:36.611
What's wrong with this kid?

14:36.819 --> 14:40.239
My brother needs a ride on a firetruck
like I got from my dad.

14:40.323 --> 14:44.703
Sorry, son. These trucks aren't toys.
Sounds like the last chief bent the rules.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.499
Are you sure this kid's okay?

14:50.375 --> 14:52.793
Hey, wait a second. I know you.

14:53.002 --> 14:56.839
Yes, you probably do.
I'm television's Danny Tanner.

14:57.048 --> 14:58.466
Kids, I got this.

14:59.300 --> 15:03.763
You probably remember me from <i>Wake Up, San</i>
<i>Francisco</i>, a show I hosted for 28 years.

15:03.846 --> 15:06.224
In fact, would you like
an autographed photo?

15:06.307 --> 15:09.644
This is your lucky day.
I actually have them in wallet-size.

15:11.771 --> 15:13.773
July 13, 1991.

15:14.733 --> 15:16.817
<i>Wake Up, San Francisco</i> was doing a segment

15:16.901 --> 15:19.487
on public servants
with interesting hobbies.

15:19.696 --> 15:22.532
I remember that show.
We had a break-dancing paramedic.

15:22.741 --> 15:25.660
Yeah. And you let him do two numbers.

15:25.744 --> 15:27.787
And then you ran out of time.

15:27.870 --> 15:29.372
For guess who?

15:29.455 --> 15:31.583
The singing fireman.

15:32.833 --> 15:36.421
Chief, that was a long time ago.
Could we just focus on the boys here?

15:37.672 --> 15:42.468
Oh, I'm sorry. My producers are telling me
we don't have time for this segment.

15:46.097 --> 15:50.309
-[sighs] I'm sorry, Max.
-It's okay, Grandpa. You tried.

15:56.023 --> 15:59.068
"Eat more Chinese food."

16:00.528 --> 16:04.198
That's not a fortune.
That's not even good dietary advice.

16:04.282 --> 16:05.324
[laughing]

16:05.408 --> 16:07.577
Alright, your turn. What's yours say?

16:10.663 --> 16:13.374
"Don't eat the egg rolls.
They're a week old."

16:14.083 --> 16:15.418
[laughs]

16:15.501 --> 16:16.669
Good shot!

16:16.877 --> 16:18.003
[laughs]

16:21.173 --> 16:24.260
-You have a great laugh.
-Thank you.

16:24.469 --> 16:29.307
Kinda feels like a date. I think.
I haven't been on one since my divorce.

16:30.141 --> 16:33.018
Yeah, I haven't been on a date since 1999.

16:33.102 --> 16:36.606
And I was so worried about that Y2K thing,
I couldn't even enjoy it.

16:38.483 --> 16:42.069
Yeah, I am really not looking forward
to the whole dating thing.

16:42.278 --> 16:44.029
Me neither.

16:44.113 --> 16:48.409
Where am I going to find a beautiful woman
who can de-worm a shih tzu?

16:50.411 --> 16:52.455
They are hard to find.

16:56.334 --> 17:00.087
Well, we're done. I, um...
I guess we should go home.

17:00.296 --> 17:01.964
How about you go? I'll clean up.

17:02.173 --> 17:06.636
Oh. Thank you. And thank you
for helping me with the inventory.

17:07.762 --> 17:11.598
-Well, see you Monday.
-Okay. Monday it is.

17:15.269 --> 17:16.729
D.J., wait.

17:29.868 --> 17:32.578
I was gonna say you forgot your purse.

17:36.749 --> 17:37.792
Oh!

17:38.877 --> 17:40.378
Sorry.

17:40.879 --> 17:44.131
I thought you... Well, yeah,
you knew what I thought.

17:45.257 --> 17:46.384
Bye.

17:54.183 --> 17:56.352
Oh, my lanta!

17:58.437 --> 18:01.357
[stammers] Well, bye again.

18:02.358 --> 18:03.442
[Matt laughs]

18:04.944 --> 18:06.987
[stammers] Yeah, there's like a thing...

18:07.196 --> 18:08.489
Oh, duh!

18:08.573 --> 18:10.700
It's locked.

18:10.783 --> 18:13.202
Okay, bye.

18:19.792 --> 18:21.335
Hey! How was your day?

18:21.419 --> 18:24.380
Amazing!
Papa let me drive one of his race cars!

18:24.589 --> 18:26.382
Look at this video, Mom.

18:28.467 --> 18:30.553
[Kimmy] Fernando, how could you?

18:30.762 --> 18:33.347
Boy, you're really tight on those corners.

18:33.431 --> 18:35.850
I mean, don't you know
how dangerous that was?

18:36.058 --> 18:39.311
Before you work yourself
into a Gibbler frenzy...

18:40.772 --> 18:44.817
it was a training race car
with two steering wheels.

18:44.901 --> 18:46.652
It was perfectly safe.

18:46.736 --> 18:50.823
We even had fire-retardant suits
in case of a tragic explosion.

18:51.991 --> 18:53.284
It's true what they say.

18:53.492 --> 18:56.704
Once you get past 110,
150 is just a number on the dial.

19:00.541 --> 19:04.253
I can't wait to get my license.
I'm gonna Tokyo-drift all over this town.

19:05.421 --> 19:07.256
[both imitate cars revving up]

19:07.966 --> 19:10.217
We'll be the first
father-daughter racing team.

19:10.426 --> 19:12.720
And sponsored by American Girl.

19:18.851 --> 19:22.104
"Do something grown-up," you said.
And she loved it.

19:22.313 --> 19:24.231
A sentence I shouldn't have to say:

19:24.315 --> 19:27.359
our 13-year-old daughter
should not be driving a race car.

19:29.445 --> 19:31.030
You're right.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.951
I deserve to be punished.

19:37.495 --> 19:39.413
You could give me time out.

19:40.999 --> 19:42.959
And you could join me.

19:44.084 --> 19:46.086
We could make out during time-out.

19:48.006 --> 19:51.091
Why do you always look so cute
when I'm trying to be mad at you?

19:51.300 --> 19:54.094
You bring out the cute in me.

19:57.849 --> 19:59.099
[whispers] Okay.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.357
[both giggle, then shush]

20:10.945 --> 20:12.071
Hi.

20:14.239 --> 20:16.617
-Hi.
-[sighs] Hi.

20:20.204 --> 20:22.623
What's with the goofy grins?

20:23.457 --> 20:26.002
You didn't find my brownies, did you?

20:29.254 --> 20:32.633
No. I have to tell you guys something,
but it's a secret.

20:33.217 --> 20:35.845
That's weird. I have a secret to tell you.

20:36.054 --> 20:37.805
Well, mine involves a man.

20:38.014 --> 20:39.765
So does mine.

20:40.850 --> 20:44.395
I just... I feel like
we have this amazing chemistry.

20:44.603 --> 20:46.188
Me, too!

20:47.314 --> 20:51.110
I'm afraid it might be physical attraction
and a really big mistake.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.071
Yeah, that's how I feel!

20:55.114 --> 20:57.825
Wait. Are you seeing Fernando?

21:00.536 --> 21:02.747
No, I'm talking about Matt.

21:02.830 --> 21:04.707
Wait. Are you seeing Fernando?

21:04.916 --> 21:07.543
D.J., we're focusing on you here.

21:08.711 --> 21:12.214
No, don't change the subject.
Are you back with Fernando, yes or no?

21:12.423 --> 21:15.093
No. Yes. Yes, no.

21:15.175 --> 21:17.678
I don't know. We're hanging out.

21:17.762 --> 21:19.179
And making out.

21:20.222 --> 21:21.640
But what about you and Matt?

21:21.849 --> 21:24.143
We're making out, too!

21:25.227 --> 21:28.188
-He just kissed you out of nowhere?
-Yes.

21:28.272 --> 21:31.067
Well, after I jumped into his arms
and laid one on him.

21:32.818 --> 21:37.615
The soccer moms are running wild and I'm
home on a Saturday night sorting socks.

21:39.742 --> 21:42.578
Oh, my God, I'm the spinster aunt.

21:44.663 --> 21:47.041
I don't know
where this is going with Fernando.

21:47.125 --> 21:49.752
Don't say anything to Ramona
until I figure it out.

21:49.961 --> 21:52.004
I don't know where it's going with Matt.

21:52.212 --> 21:54.590
Well, I know where I'm going. Out.

21:54.673 --> 21:56.968
I'm not coming back
till I get my own goofy grin.

21:59.261 --> 22:00.888
-Tell me everything!
-Fernando?

22:02.974 --> 22:04.391
I call.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.144
Boys, it's getting late.

22:06.351 --> 22:08.896
Nobody's going to bed
till I get my money back.

22:10.355 --> 22:13.859
These guys are cleaning me out.
But that ends now.

22:15.194 --> 22:17.196
Tens and queens.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.031
Full house.

22:24.078 --> 22:27.123
Kings and aces. Fuller house.

22:31.127 --> 22:33.087
Mom, you wanna take my spot?

22:36.590 --> 22:39.301
Not having a great day, huh, buddy?

22:40.469 --> 22:41.512
You were right.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.015
Lies come back to haunt you.

22:44.223 --> 22:49.020
Well, I hate to say it, honey,
but I'm always right.

22:50.604 --> 22:54.608
Going down to that fire station today,
I know you had to be missing your dad.

22:54.817 --> 22:57.987
Sometimes it's hard for me
even to remember him.

22:58.196 --> 23:02.366
Well, I'm lucky 'cause I get
to see your dad every day in you boys.

23:02.574 --> 23:03.742
What do you mean?

23:04.326 --> 23:06.912
Well, boys, come here.

23:10.415 --> 23:13.627
Look, you've got your father's eyes.

23:14.545 --> 23:17.256
And Jackson,
you've got his same mop of hair.

23:18.382 --> 23:20.092
And you've both got his smile.

23:21.260 --> 23:24.847
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna have a Dad Day.

23:24.930 --> 23:28.475
And we'll watch all the videos
and look at all of the pictures.

23:28.559 --> 23:29.560
Cool!

23:29.768 --> 23:32.479
And Dad's favorite dinner--
pancakes and milkshakes.

23:32.688 --> 23:34.732
That's my favorite, too!

23:35.440 --> 23:36.567
You got it!

23:39.737 --> 23:42.489
Come on, Dad.
You're gonna love the new couch.

23:42.698 --> 23:45.951
I'll sit on it,
but don't ask me to love it.

23:50.664 --> 23:52.250
What do you think?

23:52.457 --> 23:55.294
[chuckles] It's... it's...
It's exactly the same.

23:55.502 --> 23:57.880
I love it! Thank you, honey.

23:58.089 --> 24:00.258
Oh, my gosh. Oh...

24:01.259 --> 24:04.011
[groans] That's good sittin'.

24:05.554 --> 24:09.016
And here, I got you
an early Father's Day present.

24:12.144 --> 24:13.645
Is this what I think it is?

24:14.605 --> 24:16.523
I had it made from the original couch.

24:30.621 --> 24:34.208
It's... it's my own sofa blazer.

24:34.416 --> 24:40.380
And it... Look, it even comes
with loose change and an old Tic Tac.

24:42.216 --> 24:44.384
-Thank you. Love it.
-Good.

24:44.802 --> 24:46.929
[sighs deeply]

24:52.226 --> 24:54.519
Hey, Aunt Steph. Have you seen Grandpa?

25:03.028 --> 25:04.655
I'm right here.

25:05.906 --> 25:07.116
I need you upstairs.

25:07.325 --> 25:09.576
-Alright. Thank you!
-You're welcome.

25:09.660 --> 25:11.245
This is the best gift ever.

25:13.664 --> 25:15.582
Max, your ride's here.

25:15.791 --> 25:17.584
But I thought you were driving me.

25:17.793 --> 25:20.171
I think you'll like this ride
a little better.

25:21.630 --> 25:23.841
Anybody need a lift on a firetruck?

25:25.550 --> 25:28.887
-For real?
-Your grandpa and brother arranged it.

25:29.096 --> 25:32.350
I pulled a few strings,
but this whole thing was Jackson's idea.

25:33.225 --> 25:35.060
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

25:37.021 --> 25:38.563
Go on, you little doofus.

25:40.941 --> 25:43.361
So how did you change
that fire chief's mind?

25:43.568 --> 25:45.737
Everybody has a weak spot.

25:45.946 --> 25:47.531
