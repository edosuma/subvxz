01:31.902 --> 01:35.808
Synchro: jayson.sosweet

01:56.191 --> 01:58.529
It's not miniature golf, son.

01:58.796 --> 02:01.801
There are no curbs
surrounding the windmill

02:02.311 --> 02:04.367
to bounce the ball back into play.

02:08.413 --> 02:09.306
There...

02:09.741 --> 02:11.245
You go, nothing to it.

02:11.497 --> 02:13.830
You can do it?
All it takes is practice.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.100
Practice and a good teacher.

02:16.662 --> 02:19.339
You're dreaming, dad. There's no way
that I'm going to practice for a game

02:19.389 --> 02:21.668
that I honestly don't give a damn about.

02:21.789 --> 02:25.390
Wrong again, son. The only person
who's dreaming here is little wifey.

02:26.828 --> 02:28.090
Whatever you say.

02:30.586 --> 02:33.422
I used to go to a pro for a while.

02:33.506 --> 02:35.801
I can give you his number.
He's in Tampa.

02:35.855 --> 02:37.371
He runs a week-long course.

02:37.838 --> 02:40.721
Make a vacation out of it.
Take the whole family down there.

02:41.296 --> 02:43.822
And, hell, do it!
Do it as soon as you wake up.

02:43.896 --> 02:46.710
It's not like there's anything standing
in the way of your going.

02:46.768 --> 02:48.991
Dad, it's the middle of the school year.

02:49.056 --> 02:51.411
And I know you think
that I'm not doing anything, 

02:51.466 --> 02:53.902
but I'm actually out
there looking for work.

02:54.246 --> 02:57.981
Besides, Allison and I don't have
any money right now to take a vacation.

02:58.408 --> 03:00.412
All right, so don't go to Florida.

03:00.666 --> 03:02.903
But do yourself a favor.
Take a little holiday.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.002
You're as nervous as a whore in church.

03:06.435 --> 03:08.111
How 'bout a car trip?

03:09.097 --> 03:10.710
You can go to California.

03:10.905 --> 03:13.382
Check out universal. Disneyland?

03:13.505 --> 03:16.063
Why this sudden urge to travel?
What are you trying to pull?

03:16.187 --> 03:19.142
I'm not actually trying to
pull anything. I am just suggesting

03:19.197 --> 03:22.821
as forcibly as possible that
you and yours get out of town this week.

03:24.516 --> 03:27.703
and, while I'm suggesting,
don't answer that phone.

03:27.758 --> 03:31.002
Don't worry, I can't.
I'm here on the driving range with you.

03:32.987 --> 03:34.072
That's right.

03:35.028 --> 03:36.330
Just let it ring.

03:37.468 --> 03:38.271
Damn.

03:38.996 --> 03:40.691
- What's the matter?
- You answered it.

03:50.146 --> 03:52.070
Mom, I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

03:52.125 --> 03:54.651
I swear to you, you'll have
every cent back the instant I get work.

03:58.175 --> 04:00.611
Mom, you know you're welcome
to visit us anytime you want.

04:01.756 --> 04:02.592
This week?

04:04.778 --> 04:05.511
Sure.

04:06.318 --> 04:07.090
What?

04:07.405 --> 04:09.930
She's bringing the money
that I asked to borrow.

04:09.996 --> 04:12.172
Besides, it's not like we have
anything else to do.

04:12.715 --> 04:15.371
I was thinking about maybe
taking the kids to Disneyland.

04:17.045 --> 04:19.161
Mom? I'm sure that it's fine, but, 

04:20.116 --> 04:21.240
You know we're, 

04:21.575 --> 04:23.221
three hours earlier here.

04:25.177 --> 04:27.341
Just let me run it
by Allison when she gets up.

04:28.718 --> 04:30.670
I'll call you in a couple hours.

04:33.928 --> 04:34.740
Disneyland?

04:36.098 --> 04:37.771
It wasn't my idea.

04:40.537 --> 04:42.243
Is grandma coming to visit?

04:44.958 --> 04:46.510
Yeah, it looks that way.

04:46.607 --> 04:47.763
What are you doing up?

04:48.655 --> 04:50.460
I had a nightmare. Couldn't sleep.

04:51.146 --> 04:52.252
Are you okay?

04:52.706 --> 04:54.890
Fine, just weird.

04:55.866 --> 04:57.730
You don't have to be up
for another hour.

04:57.888 --> 04:59.042
Try to get some rest.

05:06.785 --> 05:08.280
Are you going to answer that?

05:08.336 --> 05:10.362
It's the third time they've called.

05:12.537 --> 05:13.370
There.

05:14.265 --> 05:15.180
All gone.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.541
What's her name?

05:20.616 --> 05:21.833
It's not a her.

05:21.908 --> 05:23.582
Trust me, it's not a her.

05:28.235 --> 05:29.302
She's back.

05:33.896 --> 05:35.311
The fire department?

05:36.105 --> 05:38.060
You cheating on me with a fireman?

05:38.565 --> 05:40.872
Knock it off.
It's too early for your kind of comedy.

05:40.948 --> 05:42.813
Then tell me
what's going on? Nothing.

05:42.875 --> 05:45.210
The phone's ringing,
I'm not answering it.

05:47.505 --> 05:49.623
Oh, my god. It's tuesday.

05:50.225 --> 05:53.130
I heard a rumor about this.
You're part of this tuesday thing.

05:53.225 --> 05:55.312
None of your business
What are you talking about?

05:55.395 --> 05:56.993
It's completely my business.

05:57.056 --> 06:00.843
If this is what think it is, it's
what my whole day is going to be about.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.813
Why don't you just tell them
you're sick? That's the plan, isn't it?

06:04.877 --> 06:06.511
Isn't that how the "blue flu" works?

06:06.576 --> 06:08.580
One day all the cops
in Phoenix are magically sick.

06:08.765 --> 06:11.630
Angry tax payers call the mayor.
The next day the contract negotiations

06:11.685 --> 06:14.181
with the city take a whole different turn.
- Hey, look around.

06:14.237 --> 06:15.801
I'd like a bigger place.

06:16.345 --> 06:18.081
I'd like a nicer car. Is that a crime?

06:19.716 --> 06:21.773
Where you going? It's barely 7:00.

06:39.277 --> 06:41.150
Girls! Three minutes!

06:41.747 --> 06:44.313
I'm taking you to school.
Mommy's got a meeting.

06:45.638 --> 06:47.393
Listen, after I drop the girls off,

06:47.466 --> 06:49.643
I'm going to stop by
the grocery store and pick up

06:49.708 --> 06:51.370
couple things I know that my mom wants.

06:51.607 --> 06:53.532
You're doing the Cynthia
meeting here, right?

06:53.606 --> 06:55.383
Yeah, I can't go to her office.

06:55.438 --> 06:57.261
I'm her big secret. Remember?

06:58.225 --> 06:59.450
She's bringing the check.

06:59.946 --> 07:02.160
I told you she's bringing the check,
right? $10, 000.

07:02.585 --> 07:04.311
She had to sell a couple bonds
to get it.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.851
Joe, I'm not upset your mother's coming.
I'm nervous.

07:08.205 --> 07:11.553
I haven't seen this woman since all this
stuff came out about me.

07:13.105 --> 07:14.401
No, it's not okay.

07:15.216 --> 07:17.702
If one of my children
was married for almost 15 years

07:17.756 --> 07:19.801
and I thought I knew this person,
and then suddenly

07:19.867 --> 07:22.680
one day this thing comes out
in the paper. This thing that is central

07:22.738 --> 07:24.511
to who they are as a person?

07:25.066 --> 07:26.853
I don't know, I would feel...

07:26.986 --> 07:28.633
hurt or... or angry.

07:29.507 --> 07:32.681
I don't hear that. Not on the phone.
She just sounds excited.

07:32.736 --> 07:35.782
Sounds like she just really
looking forward to seeing us all.

07:35.836 --> 07:37.243
I hope you're right.

07:44.595 --> 07:46.901
Somebody check the temperature in hell.

07:46.976 --> 07:49.172
I think I see one of Phoenix's finest

07:49.226 --> 07:51.272
actually out doing his job.

07:51.846 --> 07:55.290
- Thanks for leaving your sick bed.
- Nice to see you, too.

07:57.636 --> 07:58.640
My god.

07:59.605 --> 08:00.532
This is awful.

08:01.328 --> 08:03.342
I still can't be sure it's a crime.

08:03.777 --> 08:07.462
How do weknow whoever this is didn't
just fall asleep with a cigarette?

08:07.578 --> 08:09.462
Or a joint or a crack pipe?

08:10.086 --> 08:11.010
We don't.

08:11.517 --> 08:15.282
Just seems highly unlikely to me
that somebody would cover themselves,

08:15.467 --> 08:19.531
the walls and the drapes in accelerant,
and then go roll themselves a doobie.

08:20.485 --> 08:22.301
This fire was set, detective.

08:27.455 --> 08:28.570
Good morning.

08:34.297 --> 08:35.472
I like Phoenix.

08:36.248 --> 08:38.381
But I'm goingto have to get busy or

08:38.447 --> 08:41.092
they'll put me on a plane
to Denver or Albuquerque, anywhere

08:41.158 --> 08:42.780
they can make money off me.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.282
Which would, of course, 

08:45.338 --> 08:47.422
be the end of our little arrangement.

08:47.808 --> 08:50.920
So, I was wondering whether
you could have a look at these.

08:51.425 --> 08:55.650
These are unsolved cases from
our Ameritips office here in Phoenix.

08:56.777 --> 08:58.980
Missing people, missing things...

09:01.406 --> 09:03.892
Tell me whether you, you get a twinge.

09:04.375 --> 09:05.302
A twinge?

09:05.827 --> 09:07.712
A twinge, an orgasm, 

09:07.786 --> 09:11.583
a hot flash, I don't care.
I'm just trying to create some churn,

09:11.638 --> 09:12.833
some activity.

09:13.945 --> 09:14.850
So...

09:15.666 --> 09:18.740
I want you to look at this stuff,
live with it for a bit,

09:19.000 --> 09:19.690
and...

09:20.262 --> 09:24.209
let's see if we can't drum up a little
business for ourselves here in Phoenix?

09:35.729 --> 09:36.458
Owen?

09:37.109 --> 09:39.040
Principal Reed needs to see you.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.732
I just kept telling myself
it didn't mean anything.

10:15.805 --> 10:17.161
Just a weird dream.

10:17.815 --> 10:19.493
Do you want to tell me about it?

10:19.557 --> 10:20.500
The dream?

10:20.758 --> 10:21.413
No.

10:21.848 --> 10:24.930
The point is that,
today, when I was in world themes, 

10:25.036 --> 10:28.502
the principal came and, and pulled the
boy that I dreamt about out of class.

10:30.326 --> 10:33.670
I saw them in the hallway and
he was telling Owen something and,

10:35.068 --> 10:36.462
Owen started crying.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.390
Then I heard that his mom had died.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.131
Is that what happened in your dream?

10:43.807 --> 10:45.541
I guess I just don't get it.

10:49.197 --> 10:50.672
You don't get what, honey?

10:51.178 --> 10:51.902
Why?

10:53.955 --> 10:55.662
Why did I dream that dream?

10:57.237 --> 10:59.960
Was I supposed to do
something or say something?

11:01.327 --> 11:02.642
Could I have stopped it?

11:03.556 --> 11:05.273
You're a 15-year-old girl.

11:06.527 --> 11:10.042
I have to believe that if your
dream could have saved a woman's life

11:10.136 --> 11:12.982
it would have been dreamt
by somebody a little more...

11:13.406 --> 11:16.143
a little older,
a little more sure of themselves.

11:17.106 --> 11:19.813
Mom! Dad!

11:21.708 --> 11:24.281
- Look what we made!
- Wow, look at that!

11:24.356 --> 11:26.603
That is quite a piece of handiwork.

11:26.856 --> 11:30.571
Girls, that is beautiful,
but daddy and I already decided that,

11:31.508 --> 11:33.152
grandma's going to stay in Ariel's room.

11:33.816 --> 11:34.581
What?

11:34.868 --> 11:37.843
Ariel, I need you to go sleep in
your sisters' room on the air mattress.

11:37.908 --> 11:40.382
Why do I have to give up my room?
Bridgette and Marie really want grandma

11:40.438 --> 11:43.913
to stay with them in theirs.
- No, because grandma is too old

11:43.977 --> 11:46.250
to share a room.
- You don't know that.

11:46.318 --> 11:48.720
She likes sharing.
She's always telling me to share.

11:49.587 --> 11:51.301
- Girls...
- I say we have a vote.

11:51.368 --> 11:53.973
Everybody in favor of
grandma sleeping in our room, 

11:54.035 --> 11:55.251
raise your hand.

11:56.908 --> 11:59.432
Sorry,
girls, this is not up for a vote.

11:59.837 --> 12:01.792
But I thought
we lived in a democracy.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.693
Actually, here in the Dubois household,
we live in what I like to think of

12:05.748 --> 12:08.430
as a "benign dictatorship."
- What does that mean?

12:08.628 --> 12:11.033
That means that mommy and mine
are the only votes that count.

12:11.155 --> 12:14.280
But what about the sign?
Now we have to redo the sign.

12:26.096 --> 12:29.360
I know, I'm the lowest of the low, a
public servant who won't serve the public.

12:29.426 --> 12:31.831
What do you want from me?
The other 1100 people I work with

12:31.898 --> 12:33.462
don't feel the same way.

12:33.837 --> 12:36.541
Frankly, you and your
friends at city hall don't make it easy.

12:36.618 --> 12:39.791
You won't negotiate. You won't give us
a raise. When we go on strike,

12:39.868 --> 12:41.370
you tell us we're breaking the law.

12:43.696 --> 12:47.413
don't, it's not after midnight yet. I'm
still not supposed to be answering calls.

12:48.086 --> 12:49.521
Lee Scanlon's phone.

12:50.175 --> 12:52.093
No, I'm sorry. He's sick.

12:54.568 --> 12:55.802
Really sick.

12:56.716 --> 12:58.200
Can't keep anything down.

12:58.878 --> 13:00.273
I finally got him to bed.

13:01.996 --> 13:03.650
I can give him a message.

13:04.458 --> 13:06.093
Sure, I'll write it down.

13:06.435 --> 13:08.292
Mary Stacey.

13:10.736 --> 13:11.522
Sure.

13:13.987 --> 13:15.521
So it was her house that burnt down.

13:16.366 --> 13:17.540
Her and her husband's.

13:18.227 --> 13:20.703
And it was her remains this morning.
Got it.

13:22.278 --> 13:23.861
Separated six weeks ago.

13:23.935 --> 13:26.512
She filed for divorce.
Hubby moved out, okay.

13:29.635 --> 13:32.380
Neighbor saw the husband's car
in front of the house last night,

13:32.457 --> 13:34.003
heard a loud fight in the driveway.

13:34.665 --> 13:37.131
Ten minutes later the fire started.
Got it.

13:38.177 --> 13:40.843
Absolutely.
I'll be sure and give him your best.

13:41.735 --> 13:43.223
All right, thank you.

13:43.998 --> 13:45.551
What are you so happy about?

13:46.185 --> 13:47.310
Case closed.

13:47.655 --> 13:50.161
First thing in the morning
I pick up the husband.

13:50.225 --> 13:53.021
Who knows? I put this thing to bed fast
enough, maybe no one will even notice

13:53.077 --> 13:56.101
I was in school
when I was supposed to be playing hooky.

14:22.337 --> 14:23.273
Need a date?

14:23.745 --> 14:25.270
Free for the rest of the night?

14:30.335 --> 14:32.243
Do you mind if we went to my office?

14:33.275 --> 14:35.282
There's no one there, it's...

14:35.697 --> 14:36.881
perfectly safe.

14:38.688 --> 14:40.823
I'd rather not look for a hotel room.

14:45.757 --> 14:46.563
Nice.

14:53.577 --> 14:55.492
What do you do here, sweetheart?

15:04.128 --> 15:05.563
Oh, my god.

15:06.537 --> 15:07.803
I love this.

15:09.815 --> 15:11.840
Are we going to do it in the chair?

15:12.948 --> 15:13.942
Actually, 

15:15.267 --> 15:16.821
I'd really like that.

15:22.708 --> 15:25.592
I hear that dentists
have really good drugs.

15:26.036 --> 15:27.373
Any truth to that?

15:29.817 --> 15:31.473
I thought you'd never ask.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.671
That's kind of big.

15:46.307 --> 15:48.491
Don't you got anything I can swallow?

15:50.475 --> 15:51.600
Don't worry.

15:52.865 --> 15:54.811
We'll get around to that eventually.

16:16.147 --> 16:17.311
What you doing?

16:20.985 --> 16:23.870
And what's in that box
that can't wait till morning?

16:24.885 --> 16:25.743
These.

16:27.018 --> 16:27.740
This.

16:29.625 --> 16:30.711
This is good.

16:31.055 --> 16:32.622
This is very, very good.

16:32.728 --> 16:35.420
This little girl's been
missing for about nine months, 

16:35.476 --> 16:37.690
mommy and daddy are probably
just coming to terms

16:37.747 --> 16:40.332
with the idea they're
never going to see her again, 

16:40.407 --> 16:41.163
and...

16:41.216 --> 16:43.941
they get a call from
me saying I've got a new lead.

16:44.468 --> 16:46.642
Maybe I can even renegotiate our fee.

16:46.958 --> 16:49.530
I told you,
she was working as a prostitute.

16:50.548 --> 16:54.042
That sure beats being dead.
There's no crime to solve if she's dead.

16:54.108 --> 16:57.040
There's no fee to collect if she's dead.

17:00.388 --> 17:02.782
I wonder if you would
look after this stuff, 

17:02.856 --> 17:04.849
while I go to the little girls' room.

17:16.278 --> 17:19.410
Hi. You don't know me,
but I hear this is the number to call

17:19.477 --> 17:20.820
if you need cheap legal help.

17:21.028 --> 17:22.852
Is this who I think it is?

17:23.207 --> 17:25.542
You'd be stunned at
how cheap you can get me.

17:25.827 --> 17:26.781
Excellent.

17:27.135 --> 17:30.693
'Cause I've actually got a case and
I could use some paralegal assistance.

17:30.747 --> 17:33.763
A little paralegal
or a little paranormal?

17:34.705 --> 17:36.830
Can you meet meat police
headquarters, 1:00?

17:37.256 --> 17:39.091
You just try to keep me away.

17:41.167 --> 17:42.930
Got a lot of stuff here, mom.

17:43.008 --> 17:45.851
- You sure you're only staying a couple
days? - Just a quick visit.

17:45.928 --> 17:47.052
I promise.

17:47.265 --> 17:49.240
You didn't haveto buy the whole mall.

17:49.305 --> 17:52.640
- The girls just enjoy spending time
with you. - That's nice of you to say,

17:52.708 --> 17:55.790
but I'm a grandmother.
I'm supposed to spoil my grandkids.

17:56.295 --> 17:58.873
Besides, it's my money and I'll spend it
any way I want to.

17:59.467 --> 18:01.591
You can't take it with you, you know?

18:02.586 --> 18:04.313
At least that's what I hear.

18:04.478 --> 18:05.813
Is that what you hear?

18:09.636 --> 18:11.892
She feels funny that we never told you.

18:12.205 --> 18:14.103
I feel funny that I never told you.

18:15.368 --> 18:17.090
How could she have told me?

18:17.616 --> 18:19.363
How could you have told me?

18:26.135 --> 18:28.060
If the day isn't going bad enough.

18:28.126 --> 18:29.160
Relax.

18:29.475 --> 18:32.801
Our old friend Manuel Devalos has himself
a case. He asked me to meet him here

18:32.868 --> 18:36.671
and give him a hand. - Excellent.
I could use a friendly face around here.

18:41.926 --> 18:43.882
So what have you been working on?

18:44.288 --> 18:46.240
A couple of things.
Got a murder case.

18:46.295 --> 18:48.800
I'm about to interview
the number one suspect.

18:49.066 --> 18:51.473
It's pretty open and shut though.
Guy didn't like his wife

18:51.525 --> 18:53.261
so he set his house on fire.

18:53.398 --> 18:55.242
- With her in it.
- Oh, nice.

18:55.398 --> 18:57.592
You haven't had any
good arson dreams lately, have you?

18:58.796 --> 19:01.210
You wouldn't happen to be looking
for a horny dentist?

19:17.585 --> 19:18.982
Yeah, they love me.

19:20.228 --> 19:22.272
- What's that all about?
- I don't know.

19:22.348 --> 19:24.893
Something going around the precinct,
I'm the only one who didn't catch it.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.693
I think they're all jealous.

19:28.046 --> 19:29.332
I don't see Manny.

19:29.808 --> 19:32.833
Anyway, I got me a scumbag
to interrogate. A mr. Graham Stacey.

19:34.545 --> 19:36.061
Don't let me keep you.

19:36.288 --> 19:39.050
Be sure and tell our old
boss hello for me. Will you?

19:39.108 --> 19:40.670
I'll definitely do that.

19:43.718 --> 19:45.480
Mr. Stacey, my name is detective...

19:54.547 --> 19:56.681
This is sure going to be interesting.

20:01.265 --> 20:04.391
TO ALISON: THE EAGLE HAS LANDED

20:08.305 --> 20:11.551
I thought we might as well
get this out of the way right now.

20:13.208 --> 20:16.113
You're going to get every
cent of this back. Plus interest.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.430
I'm your mother.
I don't charge interest.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.983
I'm your son,
and I don't accept charity.

20:22.405 --> 20:25.621
My wife
called me at my hotel room around 8:00.

20:27.897 --> 20:30.883
We're in the process of
getting a divorce. Not my idea.

20:31.487 --> 20:34.623
- I haven't been living at the house for
a while now. - But you still have a key?

20:34.678 --> 20:36.742
Yes, I do.
It's still my house, too.

20:36.817 --> 20:41.023
- What was the conversation about?
- She said she was rethinking some things.

20:41.077 --> 20:43.051
She said she missed me,
would I come over.

20:44.055 --> 20:45.871
- What happened?
- I went over.

20:47.645 --> 20:49.982
Your neighbors reported
hearing a loud argument around 9:00.

20:50.035 --> 20:52.322
Would it be fair to assume
that that was you and mrs. Stacey?

20:52.867 --> 20:54.853
Yes, I'd say that's a fair assumption.

20:55.575 --> 20:58.043
I really don't know
how to explain this, but,

20:58.948 --> 21:01.133
I got to the house, and it was...

21:01.657 --> 21:03.871
like a different woman had phoned me.
- She wasn't happy

21:03.935 --> 21:08.171
to see you? - No, she wasn't. I only got
to the garage before we started fighting.

21:08.386 --> 21:09.730
Then what happened?

21:10.076 --> 21:13.080
Nothing. We argued maybe five minutes,
and I left.

21:13.486 --> 21:14.930
You left? Just like that?

21:14.985 --> 21:16.580
She was out of control.

21:17.356 --> 21:18.302
Screaming.

21:18.445 --> 21:22.361
I knew my attorney wouldn't have wanted
me over there in the first place, so,

21:22.508 --> 21:25.200
when I saw how angry she was,
I got out of there.

21:27.077 --> 21:27.813
Back up.

21:29.018 --> 21:30.851
So you're saying you
never went in the house?

21:30.976 --> 21:33.400
I think my client's been
fairly clear on that point.

21:34.198 --> 21:35.312
Thank you, counselor.

21:39.098 --> 21:41.523
You fought in the garage,
and then you left. That's your story.

21:41.747 --> 21:43.193
That's what happened.

21:44.416 --> 21:46.611
Not to be labor the obvious, but...

21:47.728 --> 21:50.311
to the best of your recollection,
your wife...

21:50.377 --> 21:52.003
she was alive when you drove off?

21:52.486 --> 21:53.420
Of course.

21:53.905 --> 21:54.651
So, yes?

21:55.885 --> 21:57.953
You didn't smell any smoke,
you didn't see any flames?

21:58.008 --> 22:00.080
I smelled no smoke, I saw no flames.

22:01.076 --> 22:02.953
If I had, I wouldn't have left.

22:04.785 --> 22:06.073
She was my wife.

22:07.057 --> 22:08.160
I still loved her.

22:12.568 --> 22:13.832
Is that all, Lee?

22:14.948 --> 22:16.120
Not quite, no.

22:18.257 --> 22:20.653
What would you say if I told you
that we obtained a warrant

22:20.706 --> 22:23.301
to retrieve the clothing
that you sent down to the hotel laundry

22:23.368 --> 22:25.232
that night?
- On what grounds?

22:25.546 --> 22:28.330
What if I told you that we found traces
of an accelerant, that matched

22:28.385 --> 22:30.590
the kind that was used
to start the fire in your house?

22:30.645 --> 22:32.333
What would you say to that?

22:36.375 --> 22:37.541
I'd say I believe that.

22:38.908 --> 22:40.952
Like I said, we were in the garage.

22:41.275 --> 22:43.453
It got heated.
There was a glass jar.

22:43.545 --> 22:46.571
It hit the wall and smashed.
I thought it was turpentine.

22:48.955 --> 22:51.151
Is there anything else, detective?
Because if not, I think

22:51.215 --> 22:54.553
my client would appreciate some rest.
He's had an extraordinarily harrowing day.

22:54.817 --> 22:56.441
Not as tough as his wife's.

22:57.326 --> 22:58.403
Detective...

23:02.076 --> 23:05.052
You know what?
I think I'd like to take a short break.

23:08.187 --> 23:09.803
Can I talk to you outside in the hall?

23:10.345 --> 23:11.013
Me?

23:12.296 --> 23:13.172
In the hall?

23:17.198 --> 23:19.252
What do you think? What do you see?

23:19.998 --> 23:23.602
What do you mean, "what do I see?"
I'm not the new kid in school here.

23:23.775 --> 23:26.523
I saw you staring at him. I know how
this works. Is anything that he's saying

23:26.578 --> 23:28.230
matching up to what you're seeing?

23:28.297 --> 23:30.490
- Somebody want to tell me what's
going on? - Nothing...

23:30.566 --> 23:32.983
- Just two old friends having a chat.
- That's fine, but

23:33.037 --> 23:35.083
let me just remind the one old friend
who's in my employ that

23:35.137 --> 23:37.713
there's this little thing called
attorney-client privilege, and let me remind

23:37.767 --> 23:39.310
the other old friend...
- Excuse counselor but...

23:39.367 --> 23:41.452
- you'd be hard-pressed... - doing what
you're doing, I'll have to report you,

23:41.505 --> 23:43.352
to find a judge who believes,
attorney-client privilege extends to...

23:43.405 --> 23:46.232
- Did you see something in there? Did you
have a dream? - I asked you first.

23:46.308 --> 23:49.913
- She works for me! - Don't force
me to bring you in for questioning!

23:52.147 --> 23:54.743
Excuse me?
Are you folks coming back in?

23:54.946 --> 23:56.382
Am I supposed to just

23:56.458 --> 23:58.320
sit in here? You said this wouldn't
take very long.

23:58.377 --> 23:59.810
That there's no grounds to charge me.

24:01.015 --> 24:03.701
Please give us a moment.
We'll be right back in.

24:03.906 --> 24:04.851
Thank you.

24:07.757 --> 24:09.690
I don't know what to tell you,
either one of you.

24:09.755 --> 24:11.883
I saw what you saw,
I heard what you heard.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.781
And the only thing I'm dreaming about
is a runaway girl

24:14.835 --> 24:18.171
selling herself as a prostitute,
and the fact that my mother-in-law

24:18.225 --> 24:21.163
is coming in town for a visit,
and I really can't tell you which one

24:21.215 --> 24:22.573
scares me the most.

24:30.756 --> 24:31.721
I'm sorry.

24:32.707 --> 24:34.153
I'm really sorry.

24:48.438 --> 24:51.641
Hi, mom. Grandma's teaching us
how to sing in french.

24:51.706 --> 24:53.023
I see that.

24:53.847 --> 24:54.730
Welcome.

24:55.436 --> 24:57.130
It's wonderful to see you.

24:57.208 --> 24:58.721
It's wonderful to be seen.

24:59.378 --> 25:01.223
Did you get some dinner?
There's plenty left.

25:01.268 --> 25:02.531
Grandma made fondue.

25:03.526 --> 25:05.023
It's gooey!

25:05.636 --> 25:07.273
I don't want to miss that.

25:09.077 --> 25:11.771
It's official. I must be on the fritz.

25:11.855 --> 25:14.442
- I'm sorry. You must be on the what?
- The fritz.

25:15.508 --> 25:17.230
I was at this meeting today.

25:17.846 --> 25:20.783
One of Devalos's clients
was being questioned, 

25:20.848 --> 25:24.623
and we're all sitting there, trying to
figure out if this guy's telling the truth.

25:24.685 --> 25:25.973
And then I see...

25:27.065 --> 25:27.931
nothing.

25:28.326 --> 25:30.120
So that means you must be on the fritz?

25:31.555 --> 25:33.581
It's not like you always see something.

25:33.647 --> 25:36.151
It's not like this
has never happened before.

25:36.455 --> 25:39.133
I know, but just,
they were so counting on me.

25:39.827 --> 25:41.693
And then tonight, your mother.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.480
You know, I had a dream, a premonition

25:45.315 --> 25:47.111
that this visit was something

25:47.668 --> 25:50.241
should be avoided,
something we should run away from.

25:50.298 --> 25:53.291
And then I get home,
and she's so great with the kids.

25:53.346 --> 25:55.280
And she's lending us that money.

25:56.095 --> 25:58.790
And she seemed so serene.

25:59.385 --> 26:02.451
I know. When I picked her up
from the airport, I had prepared myself.

26:02.725 --> 26:05.702
I think deep inside,
I was dreading this visit, 'cause...

26:06.075 --> 26:07.841
Here I am, I don't have a job, and...

26:07.897 --> 26:10.460
I'm borrowing money from my mother, 

26:10.526 --> 26:12.090
plus all that stuff with you...

26:12.235 --> 26:14.541
She didn't mention that once today,
not once?

26:15.385 --> 26:19.183
She couldn't have been more understanding.
She couldn't have been sweeter.

26:19.918 --> 26:21.723
Maybe we're all on the fritz.

26:26.348 --> 26:27.480
Why do you have these?

26:28.657 --> 26:32.133
It's something I'm working on. A
case I'm helping mr. Devalos with. Why?

26:33.155 --> 26:34.213
This is her.

26:35.775 --> 26:39.051
This is the woman from my dream.
This is Owen Kearns's mother.

26:40.917 --> 26:42.481
Ariel, let me see that.

26:45.076 --> 26:47.872
Are you telling me this
is the woman you saw kill herself?

26:48.687 --> 26:51.581
She poured gasoline all
over herself and lit a match.

26:53.758 --> 26:56.232
I don't understand.
If this woman did this to herself,

26:56.307 --> 26:58.253
why do all these articles
say it was murder?

26:59.057 --> 27:02.261
Just curious, but when
exactly were you going to tell me

27:02.315 --> 27:05.641
that our daughter saw a woman
burn herself to death in a dream?

27:06.225 --> 27:08.732
The woman in this picture's
name is Mary Stacey.

27:08.806 --> 27:11.700
- Ariel just said thather last name
is Kearns. - Yeah, it was,

27:11.758 --> 27:13.690
when she was married
to her first husband.

27:13.758 --> 27:16.540
Devalos is working for
her second husband, Graham.

27:17.255 --> 27:19.200
The police believe he's
the one who burned her.

27:20.387 --> 27:23.422
But if Ariel's dream is right,
if she did it herself...

27:32.317 --> 27:35.353
For what it's worth, she didn't
mention you'd be here, either.

27:35.408 --> 27:38.782
Must be something good if she's
willing to risk a replay of this afternoon.

27:38.847 --> 27:41.842
Question is, good for you
or good for me? Coffee, black.

27:42.477 --> 27:44.713
You are so eager to convict my client,
aren't you?

27:44.778 --> 27:47.700
- Only 'cause I know he did it.
- And I know he didn't.

27:47.765 --> 27:51.503
All I know is, back in the day, the only
question you'd be asking yourself is

27:51.568 --> 27:53.351
whether or not to
go for the death penalty.

27:55.815 --> 27:58.340
All I know is, back in the day, 

27:58.848 --> 28:01.093
you were never so desperate
to please the man you worked for

28:01.158 --> 28:04.411
that you wouldn't be willing to look at all
the evidence before rushing to judgment.

28:05.507 --> 28:08.781
Give me five minutes alone with your
client, I'll show you a rush to judgment.

28:08.926 --> 28:09.970
Sorry I'm late.

28:11.125 --> 28:12.452
No, that's okay.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.690
Gave us a chance to patch things up.

28:16.265 --> 28:17.272
Suicide?

28:17.805 --> 28:21.260
I'm just telling you what Ariel told me.
I'm just telling you what Ariel saw.

28:22.195 --> 28:23.661
A broken marriage, 

28:23.866 --> 28:26.612
a knock-down drag-out
with the man you once loved.

28:26.917 --> 28:29.711
- Maybe it all just got to be too much
for her. - You may want to hold up there

28:29.766 --> 28:33.141
a second, dr. Phil, 'cause I talked
to all her friends and family members.

28:33.216 --> 28:35.853
None of them said anything about
her being depressed about the divorce.

28:36.045 --> 28:38.831
Some people are very good
at covering up how they really feel.

28:38.886 --> 28:40.000
I'm not one of them, 

28:40.626 --> 28:43.720
and I got to tell you, this whole
suicide theory just doesn't add up for me.

28:43.785 --> 28:45.830
First off,
nobody sets themselves on fire.

28:46.388 --> 28:48.690
Not when there are pills in
the medicine chest, when there's a

28:48.748 --> 28:50.821
perfectly good gas oven in the kitchen.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.011
Fire hurts.

28:52.406 --> 28:55.442
You don't mess with it unless
you're a monk with a war to protest.

28:55.998 --> 28:57.510
And what happened to the container?

28:58.488 --> 29:01.351
- What container? - The one she
supposedly used to douse herself with.

29:01.408 --> 29:03.431
That one, what happened to that? 'Cause
they couldn't find one

29:03.486 --> 29:04.651
anywhere near the body.

29:08.336 --> 29:09.780
Nice try, counselor.

29:17.207 --> 29:18.043
Folks?

29:18.996 --> 29:20.130
We're closing.

29:26.307 --> 29:27.793
- So?
- Don't ask.

29:29.495 --> 29:31.392
Why did Ariel dream that dream?

29:34.085 --> 29:35.163
I don't know.

29:36.095 --> 29:38.301
Maybe it's because you were overbooked.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.170
What are you talking about?

29:40.447 --> 29:41.443
You know...

29:42.116 --> 29:44.330
what with the dentist and that runaway.

29:45.445 --> 29:48.900
If a dream has to be dreamt,
and you're not there to dream it...

29:49.828 --> 29:51.281
You making fun of me?

29:51.668 --> 29:53.160
Not even a little bit.

29:53.805 --> 29:55.100
I think it's nice.

29:55.426 --> 29:57.611
Daughter picking up the slack for mom.

29:58.207 --> 30:00.433
Dipping her toe in the family business.

30:01.076 --> 30:03.781
Kind of like Sanford and son,
except with females.

30:05.647 --> 30:06.900
I'm going to bed.

30:08.775 --> 30:09.751
Who knows.

30:09.966 --> 30:12.531
Could be the beginning
of an american dynasty.

30:19.048 --> 30:22.350
Took a lot of work to
get you up to speed, young lady.

30:24.015 --> 30:25.032
Plaque...

30:25.767 --> 30:26.681
Tartar...

30:28.097 --> 30:29.453
Gingivitis...

30:29.666 --> 30:31.622
You really...

30:32.857 --> 30:34.741
put me through my paces.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.091
Aren't we the early bird?

30:46.427 --> 30:47.792
I don't understand.

30:47.936 --> 30:50.621
You're telling me this
man you keep dreaming about

30:51.137 --> 30:52.611
picked up our runaway,

30:52.985 --> 30:54.461
offered her money for sex, 

30:54.538 --> 30:57.522
drugged her,
and then, once she was unconscious, 

30:57.586 --> 30:59.301
performed dental work on her?

30:59.627 --> 31:01.331
Very extensive dental work.

31:03.157 --> 31:05.682
I can't explain it.
It was truly vicious.

31:06.385 --> 31:08.341
It was like he was
working on her whole mouth.

31:09.087 --> 31:13.000
And this man, this dentist,
seemed to be very pleased with himself.

31:17.077 --> 31:18.023
Okay what?

31:18.366 --> 31:21.051
30 years in this line of work
and...

31:22.028 --> 31:25.543
I thought I'd heard it all.
Feet, underarms, but...

31:26.596 --> 31:27.992
A dental fetish?

31:28.557 --> 31:30.971
I guess it takes all
kinds to make a world.

31:32.127 --> 31:33.071
That's it?

31:33.535 --> 31:35.523
- That's your reaction?
- I'm sorry,

31:35.588 --> 31:38.381
but what would you like
my reaction to be, Allison?

31:38.647 --> 31:41.270
This isn't a terribly
useful piece of information.

31:42.066 --> 31:44.201
We're already looking for Sally.

31:44.268 --> 31:47.151
We're already canvassing the area for,
for dentists.

31:48.585 --> 31:51.241
So some teeth were pulled,
a few cavities were filled.

31:51.305 --> 31:52.691
It's hardly a game changer.

31:54.156 --> 31:55.810
I know you want to impress me.

31:56.158 --> 31:58.671
I know the money I
give you is the only money

31:58.746 --> 32:00.591
that's coming into
your household right now...

32:02.266 --> 32:03.913
I didn't come here at dawn

32:04.376 --> 32:05.912
to try and impress you.

32:07.488 --> 32:09.693
I came here because I had a dream

32:10.156 --> 32:11.653
and I thought it was important.

32:12.227 --> 32:15.191
Discovering that our victim
is in fact a toothless hooker

32:15.247 --> 32:18.191
hardly seems to help in that regard.
Does it, Allison?

32:18.435 --> 32:21.340
Listen, I'm not paying
you to dream about just anything.

32:22.478 --> 32:25.582
I'm paying you to
dream things I can use.

32:27.295 --> 32:28.810
Thanks for stopping by.

32:33.226 --> 32:35.220
You wanted to see me, principal Reed?

32:35.817 --> 32:37.382
I wanted to ask you a favor.

32:38.115 --> 32:40.710
I see you're in world
themes with Owen Kearns.

32:40.765 --> 32:43.821
We're putting together a package
of schoolwork to send to his house

32:43.907 --> 32:45.490
and I was wondering if I could ask you

32:45.548 --> 32:48.173
to grab his resource file
when you go to class next period.

32:48.445 --> 32:49.211
Sure.

33:14.407 --> 33:18.071
"My darling Owen. This is
my favorite place in all the world.

33:18.136 --> 33:21.550
"I only wish you were here with me.
Perhaps someday soon.

33:21.837 --> 33:22.591
Mom."

33:29.886 --> 33:30.982
You looking for me?

33:31.877 --> 33:33.570
I certainly am, detective.

33:38.067 --> 33:38.831
It's,

33:39.498 --> 33:40.931
come to my attention

33:41.008 --> 33:45.080
that while others in your precinct chose
to stay home the other day

33:45.137 --> 33:47.930
in an illegal act of
defiance against the city, 

33:48.017 --> 33:48.760
you,

33:49.398 --> 33:50.793
chose to come to work.

33:51.707 --> 33:53.173
I'm impressed, detective.

33:53.966 --> 33:56.012
Strikes me you're thinking like a

33:56.446 --> 33:59.560
a man who wants to get ahead,
wants to make a name for himself.

34:00.468 --> 34:02.321
Honestly,
I wasn't thinking about any of that.

34:02.958 --> 34:06.091
Is that how you got involved with this,
Stacey case, 

34:06.157 --> 34:09.420
this thing where this
man set his wife on fire?

34:09.877 --> 34:12.871
Yeah, that was the same morning.
I was the only guy they could find.

34:12.947 --> 34:13.933
Lucky me.

34:14.036 --> 34:16.521
And are you aware
that our old friend Manuel Devalos

34:16.587 --> 34:19.391
is representing the number one suspect
in this case?

34:20.385 --> 34:21.641
"Our old friend"?

34:22.808 --> 34:26.409
- Yeah, I knew that. Why? - Because I'm
not about to let the man I replaced

34:26.485 --> 34:28.272
get the best of me in this matter.

34:29.195 --> 34:32.420
Why isn't this mr. Stacey behind bars?

34:32.878 --> 34:36.011
Why isn't any given suspect behind bars?
We can't prove it.

34:36.167 --> 34:37.641
To begin with, there's no motive.

34:38.898 --> 34:40.360
Weren't they getting divorced?

34:42.467 --> 34:45.032
If the collapse of a marriage
was grounds for murder, 

34:45.127 --> 34:47.591
half the men in the
world would be behind bars.

34:48.157 --> 34:50.690
Let me be clear, detective.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.831
I want a reason for
this man to be locked up.

34:53.887 --> 34:56.469
I want this case closed.
I want the honorable mr. Devalos

34:56.527 --> 34:58.360
on the losing side in this matter.

35:03.386 --> 35:05.553
Go find me some evidence.

35:07.138 --> 35:08.532
Go find me a motive.

35:23.708 --> 35:26.333
Graham, yes, I got your messages.

35:27.126 --> 35:30.023
Frankly, I was hoping to
have something concrete to report

35:30.098 --> 35:31.701
before I called you back.

35:33.818 --> 35:37.390
Trust me, mr. Stacey, you are absolutely
getting my undivided attention.

35:37.456 --> 35:38.950
Frankly, at the moment, 

35:39.027 --> 35:42.153
I don't have any other clients
to divide my attention among.

35:44.195 --> 35:46.582
No, I don't think that's true.

35:47.366 --> 35:49.611
The lead detective is an honest man.
He has no interest

35:49.677 --> 35:52.103
in sending someone
who's innocent to prison.

35:55.935 --> 35:57.640
I understand how you feel.

36:00.445 --> 36:02.022
You have to trust me.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.972
Of course I have a plan.
Of course I have a strategy.

36:07.596 --> 36:08.961
Your wife, your...

36:09.716 --> 36:10.882
your late wife.

36:11.248 --> 36:14.431
Did you ever know her to be despondent?

36:14.527 --> 36:18.300
Did she ever seek therapy, use any
kind of prescription antidepressants?

36:20.816 --> 36:22.601
Did she ever mention suicide?

36:24.106 --> 36:24.921
Really.

36:25.686 --> 36:28.282
An enormous passion for life,
loved to travel, 

36:28.877 --> 36:30.561
loved good food, good wine.

36:31.605 --> 36:32.300
Yes,

36:33.818 --> 36:37.152
I will call you in the morning.
Hopefully I'll have better news.

36:38.516 --> 36:39.512
Good night.

36:40.228 --> 36:41.222
You asleep?

36:41.955 --> 36:43.213
Don't think so.

36:45.647 --> 36:48.231
You know, it's easier
to do with your eyes closed.

36:48.307 --> 36:49.672
Thanks for the tip.

36:50.265 --> 36:52.531
You want to tell
me about whatever it is?

36:53.366 --> 36:55.333
You want the good news or the bad?

36:55.398 --> 36:57.231
I want you to get some sleep.

36:57.296 --> 36:58.852
I'll start with the bad.

37:00.518 --> 37:04.091
Our acting district attorney wants me
to help him crush Manny in court,

37:04.147 --> 37:07.260
which is a problem because
I really like Manny and I,

37:07.665 --> 37:10.002
really hate our acting
district attorney.

37:10.728 --> 37:12.383
That leaves the good news.

37:13.475 --> 37:15.880
I think the guy Devalos
is representing is innocent.

37:17.575 --> 37:19.533
Then there's nothing
to lose sleep over, is there?

37:23.638 --> 37:25.442
I got you into this, didn't I?

37:26.257 --> 37:30.253
You pointed me towards the diving board,
but I'm the guy who decided to jump.

37:30.886 --> 37:32.670
I got a confession to make.

37:33.048 --> 37:34.140
It felt good.

37:34.656 --> 37:36.561
I liked being the only
cop with balls big enough

37:36.618 --> 37:38.990
to go out there and do his
job when no one else wanted to.

37:40.667 --> 37:42.041
Then why aren't you sleeping?

37:42.535 --> 37:44.982
I can't tell you why.
It's just in the air.

37:46.595 --> 37:48.623
Everything's about to turn to crap.

37:49.515 --> 37:50.643
I can feel it.

37:53.315 --> 37:56.300
I think we ought to offer
to hire your mom as our cook.

37:56.966 --> 38:00.092
You ever taste fish like that?
I've never tasted fish like that.

38:00.167 --> 38:04.010
I've never seen our kids eat fish that
didn't come as a stick or a cracker.

38:05.778 --> 38:07.641
I think your mom's still awake.

38:08.775 --> 38:11.381
I haven't had a real conversation
with her since she got here.

38:11.756 --> 38:13.812
I've done nothing but talk to her
since she got here.

38:13.867 --> 38:16.301
If you're not back in five,
I'm gonna come get you.

38:20.077 --> 38:21.412
Do yourself a favor.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.123
Don't go in there.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.761
What are you doing here?

38:26.926 --> 38:29.191
The same thing I was
doing a couple of nights ago.

38:29.248 --> 38:30.473
I am trying to warn you.

38:30.677 --> 38:32.982
Did you see her with
my children tonight?

38:33.656 --> 38:37.741
I'm dead, I see everything. Which is why
I would think you would listen to me.

38:44.728 --> 38:47.541
You're not actually
here to tuck me in, are you?

38:50.158 --> 38:51.742
I wanted to thank you.

38:52.186 --> 38:53.512
For the money and,

38:54.128 --> 38:55.500
for the gifts and...

38:56.658 --> 39:00.830
- For just being here. - For showing
up uninvited on virtually no notice?

39:00.887 --> 39:03.392
No, don't be silly,
you're always invited.

39:03.825 --> 39:04.931
You're sweet.

39:06.347 --> 39:07.443
It must be...

39:08.158 --> 39:10.623
nice being able to go places on a whim.

39:11.688 --> 39:12.980
From what I've read, 

39:13.058 --> 39:16.222
it's not as if my showing up
would have surprised you anyway.

39:18.246 --> 39:19.922
We need to talk about that.

39:21.247 --> 39:24.471
It really doesn't work that way.
Because, frankly, if it did,

39:26.157 --> 39:28.362
I would have known we would have this,

39:29.156 --> 39:32.731
awkward moment
and I would have told you years ago.

39:35.985 --> 39:37.672
I am really sorry I didn't.

39:38.316 --> 39:39.343
It's okay.

39:40.086 --> 39:43.453
I'm not sure what I would
have made of it all those years ago.

39:44.537 --> 39:46.973
I guess things happen for a reason.

39:47.407 --> 39:48.362
I guess.

39:51.315 --> 39:54.023
If you need anything,
you know we're right across the hall.

39:54.815 --> 39:56.210
There is one thing.

39:57.586 --> 40:00.551
I'm not actually here on a whim.

40:04.378 --> 40:08.371
Could I take you into my confidence? Joe
can't know what I'm about to tell you.

40:17.576 --> 40:19.152
I'm pretty sick, Allison.

40:21.836 --> 40:25.631
It's not hopeless.
There's treatment, an operation.

40:26.366 --> 40:29.770
I'm flying to Minneapolis when
I leave here, to the Mayo clinic.

40:30.726 --> 40:32.302
My odds are 60%.

40:34.478 --> 40:37.311
I know, I look pretty
good for someone with 60% odds.

40:40.046 --> 40:42.622
I feel pretty good
for someone with 60% odds.

40:43.986 --> 40:45.270
Anyway, I...

40:46.415 --> 40:48.920
When I heard that number,
I thought of you.

40:49.688 --> 40:53.790
If I going to the hospital
