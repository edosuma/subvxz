01:05.230 --> 01:07.165
D'oh!

01:11.237 --> 01:12.795
Aaah!

01:29.689 --> 01:31.657
Aaah!

01:33.059 --> 01:35.926
- Ooh!
- Cool.

01:36.029 --> 01:38.156
<i>Ooh! Aaah! Ooh! Aaah!</i>

01:38.264 --> 01:40.255
Aaah! Ooh! Aaah!

01:40.366 --> 01:44.359
Hmm.

01:50.376 --> 01:53.072
Stop that. And get ready.

01:53.179 --> 01:55.545
We're going to the old folks' talent show.

01:55.648 --> 01:57.582
Now get washed up.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.481
With pleasure.

02:05.592 --> 02:08.493
Ever notice after dialysis...

02:08.595 --> 02:11.086
you always get the munchies?

02:13.867 --> 02:15.858
He's saying the stuff we all forgot.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.268
And you know what I can't open?
Cabinets.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.133
Can he say that?

02:23.243 --> 02:26.212
You know what else scares me?
Everything.

02:34.187 --> 02:37.645
Get that one! Faster!
You gotta have time for the other ones.

02:37.757 --> 02:40.419
Oh! Good. Oh, no!
That one's slowin' down!

02:40.527 --> 02:44.623
Oh, good. Oh, that one's wobbly.

02:44.731 --> 02:47.632
- Oh, you got that before I even said it.
- #What's new, pussycat #

02:47.734 --> 02:50.100
# Ow, ow, ow, ow #

02:50.203 --> 02:54.833
#What's new, pussycat Oh, God, no ##

02:55.942 --> 02:58.706
Wasn't he great, folks?

02:58.811 --> 03:00.870
Now, all the contestants
are gonna receive...

03:00.980 --> 03:02.971
extra servings of honey mush.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.046
But there can only be one winner...

03:07.153 --> 03:10.714
and, uh, since Abe's already
standing here, what the heck.

03:10.823 --> 03:13.223
Wow! A free auto.

03:13.326 --> 03:15.794
- No, keep reading.
- Oh.

03:15.895 --> 03:19.194
Hey, let's get this down to the funeral home
before they try to back out.

03:23.102 --> 03:27.596
Hmm. Well, this autopsy coupon
appears to be valid.

03:27.707 --> 03:31.404
What other funerary services
may be provide for the... predeceased?

03:31.511 --> 03:35.538
Oh, the whole deal-
Coffin, tombstone, anti-stink spray.

03:35.648 --> 03:37.946
Sir, we prefer the term "casket" to coffin...

03:38.051 --> 03:39.951
and "monument" to tombstone.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.250
We have all the leading brands
of anti-stink spray.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.290
<i>What funny names.</i>

03:48.695 --> 03:50.595
He's heading into Dead Man's Curve!

03:50.697 --> 03:54.497
- <i>Aaah! Get me out ofhere!</i>
- Oh, the living.

03:54.601 --> 03:58.093
Well, fortunately, this model
features the "cadaver cam."

04:00.707 --> 04:03.301
Look at him go.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.309
That thing got picture-in-picture?

04:05.411 --> 04:07.538
Of course. This is the Contempo.

04:09.949 --> 04:13.112
Aw, geez. How come
they never call traveling anymore?

04:13.219 --> 04:15.119
This is the deluxe area.

04:15.221 --> 04:17.712
The caskets are buried
in unused, virgin graves...

04:17.824 --> 04:20.224
the monuments are
completely self-cleaning...

04:20.326 --> 04:23.659
and there is an optional
"weeping widow" service.

04:23.763 --> 04:27.062
Wally, Wally, Wally!

04:31.671 --> 04:35.004
Irving! Oh, Irving!

04:35.108 --> 04:37.440
Oh, bury me over here. Please?

04:37.543 --> 04:39.977
Whoa, whoa. This is gettin' kind of pricey.

04:40.079 --> 04:42.604
Sir, what lies beyond
this life is a mystery...

04:42.715 --> 04:47.084
but we do know for sure that God
prefers people who travel in style.

04:47.186 --> 04:52.089
Hear that? If you cheapskate me
into hell, I'll haunt you good.

04:52.191 --> 04:54.352
Imagine this when you're
sittin' on the john.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.730
Okay!

05:02.135 --> 05:05.935
Okay, with mole insurance,
your total comes to...

05:06.039 --> 05:09.008
- $17,000.
- What?

05:09.108 --> 05:11.906
Or you could just toss him in the woods
and let the wolves carry him off.

05:12.011 --> 05:13.911
It's really up to you.

05:14.013 --> 05:16.641
- Mr. Salesman?
- Yes?

05:16.749 --> 05:18.649
We're gonna go with the wolves.

05:18.751 --> 05:20.912
Beat it.

05:23.856 --> 05:26.882
Dad, I love you this much.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.188
But that's just under $900.

05:29.295 --> 05:31.991
I wish I could go 17,000, but-

05:32.098 --> 05:34.066
Hmm? Hmm?

05:34.167 --> 05:38.103
Sir, if I may, think of it
as an investment in extravagance.

05:38.204 --> 05:40.536
The Mauso-Palooza
can be seen from space.

05:40.640 --> 05:44.269
<i>It'll consume as much cement</i>
<i>as a regulation-size tennis court.</i>

05:44.377 --> 05:47.813
Tennis court, eh?

05:47.914 --> 05:50.940
Oh, I can't believe
we went through all that...

05:51.050 --> 05:53.382
just to wind up with a tennis court.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.386
I bet you didn't see that comin'.

05:55.488 --> 05:58.616
You don't care what happens
to me when I die.

05:58.725 --> 06:02.354
Of course I do, Dad. Aw.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.862
And if it were up to me,
you wouldn't die at all.

06:04.964 --> 06:07.865
But try telling that
to "Killy McGee" up there.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.637
- Hey, what on earth are you doing?
- Practicing tennis.

06:15.742 --> 06:18.506
That's tennis?

06:18.611 --> 06:21.580
Then what's the one where
the chicks whale on each other?

06:21.681 --> 06:25.617
- Foxy boxing?
- Yes! That's what I wanted.

06:33.459 --> 06:37.691
" And finally, make sure the net
is tight and springy."

06:40.199 --> 06:43.168
Hmm. That seems about right.

06:43.269 --> 06:46.670
You know, a tennis court
can really make your house look classy.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.673
I hear Mel Brooks has one.

06:48.775 --> 06:51.073
I mean <i>Sir</i> Mel Brooks.

06:51.177 --> 06:53.077
And it's bad news for the gophers.

06:56.082 --> 06:59.643
- And it's gonna do wonders for our social life.
- Yeah!

06:59.752 --> 07:02.186
It'd be nice to entertain friends
and have people over.

07:02.288 --> 07:05.086
- Hey, you got a tennis court?
- Keep walkin', Flanders.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.557
- Will do.
- Faster.

07:14.367 --> 07:17.393
Sorry. I grunted way too early.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.403
We win again.

07:19.505 --> 07:22.030
Hey, this was a lot of fun, guys.

07:22.141 --> 07:25.702
Yeah, we never knew
nobody with their own tennis rink.

07:25.812 --> 07:29.248
So what happens now?
Is the food free, or do we pay someone?

07:29.348 --> 07:31.782
Course not. They send ya a bill.

07:31.884 --> 07:34.011
Well, that's why I asked.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.680
That's how you learn-
By asking, you dumb-ass.

07:38.925 --> 07:41.723
Can you believe it?

07:41.828 --> 07:46.231
- Kent Brockman playing on our court.
- <i>Match point.</i>

07:46.332 --> 07:49.130
And how about that Stephanie the weather girl?

07:49.235 --> 07:51.260
Homer, ball!

07:53.406 --> 07:56.864
That's game, set and match to us.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.207
But the real winners here
are Marge's hors d'oeuvres.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.873
Wow. How do you come up
with such witty remarks?

08:02.982 --> 08:04.643
Well-

08:04.750 --> 08:07.116
<i>Come on, come on. Hurry up.</i>

08:07.220 --> 08:09.780
"I guess you could say it's my racket."

08:09.889 --> 08:12.756
I guess you could say I'm Iraqi.

08:12.859 --> 08:16.226
Get off my property.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.230
So from now on...

08:19.332 --> 08:22.165
- all hats are banned from the school.
- Even bonnets?

08:22.268 --> 08:25.635
- Especially bonnets.
- I've had it with that school.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.638
Door.

08:30.243 --> 08:33.871
Oh! Chief Wiggum. Are you here
to make a bust of some kind?

08:33.980 --> 08:35.971
No, we're just, uh, checking-

08:36.082 --> 08:38.515
to make sure you're having
a crime-free morning.

08:38.618 --> 08:40.414
As far as I know.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.148
- Hey, you know what would be a real crime?
- What's that, Lou?

08:43.256 --> 08:45.588
Lettin' that tennis court go to waste.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.251
Would you boys like to play tennis?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.522
Why, yes. Yes, we would.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.963
- Okay. We'll be right out.
- Let's roll, Lou.

08:56.068 --> 08:59.037
Take it, Lou.

08:59.138 --> 09:02.869
- Huh?
- Well! Hello, Marge.

09:02.975 --> 09:06.411
- Lovely day for tennis, eh?
- I thought you had your own court.

09:06.512 --> 09:09.345
He did, but he had it converted
into a human chessboard.

09:10.816 --> 09:14.650
- Hey, Burns has been gone for a while.
- Let's make a run for it.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.654
Come back, fools! Protect me.

09:22.161 --> 09:25.460
Hey, check it out.
I'm surfing the net.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.829
Oh, that's good.

09:27.934 --> 09:30.425
His clowning around
is putting me at ease.

09:33.139 --> 09:35.437
- No.
- <i>Yes! We win again.</i>

09:35.541 --> 09:39.671
Will you get serious, Homer?
I'd like to win at least once.

09:39.779 --> 09:43.545
Come on, Marge.
All sports have their lovable clowns-

09:43.649 --> 09:47.449
John Rocker, O.J. Simpson, Dorf.

09:47.553 --> 09:50.613
<i>Hey, Homer, here's a bloopie for you.</i>

09:50.723 --> 09:53.055
I've got it. It's in the bag.

09:53.159 --> 09:56.026
Oh!

09:57.930 --> 09:59.363
Mm-mmm.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.160
Hey, Chief, we're gonna bust up
that crack house tonight.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.534
- We did that last night.
- Yeah, but this time we got the right address.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.539
- Uh, you comin'?
- I'd love to, Lou, but...

10:08.641 --> 10:10.666
uh, I'm playing tennis
at the Simpsons' again.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.438
Oh, Maggie, are your ears burning?

10:13.546 --> 10:16.709
The Simpsons? You mean
the L.A. Clippers of backyard tennis?

10:16.816 --> 10:20.343
Yeah. They're easier to beat
than a suspect in shackles.

10:20.453 --> 10:24.150
- Pretty easy to beat a suspect in shackles, Chief.
- That's a joke, Lou-

10:24.256 --> 10:26.656
It's on the Simpsons
and their easy "beatability."

10:29.962 --> 10:34.262
I think they enjoy being humiliated.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.631
I don't know what's sadder
about the Simpsons-

10:36.736 --> 10:39.762
the fact that we mock them,
or that they shall never know.

10:39.872 --> 10:44.366
<i>Never, ever, ever.</i>

10:44.477 --> 10:46.377
<i>Ever.</i>

10:49.782 --> 10:52.444
Do I have cooties?

10:52.551 --> 10:56.009
No! Aw, this home testing kit
saved me a fortune.

10:56.122 --> 10:59.091
You'll never guess what I heard
in the supermarket today.

10:59.191 --> 11:02.319
I found out we're
the laughingstock of the town.

11:02.428 --> 11:06.421
Oh. Well, that's bad news for Dingbat Charlie.
He's gonna be crushed.

11:06.532 --> 11:09.626
I thought our tennis court
was bringing us a little respectability.

11:09.735 --> 11:12.727
Instead, people make fun
of our lousiness.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.897
Okay. Now, some of that is me.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.907
All of that is you.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.204
You've gotta take this more seriously.

11:19.311 --> 11:22.678
Okay, honey.
I can see this means a lot to you.

11:22.782 --> 11:26.582
I'll practice till my elbow
is swollen and discolored.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.621
That's all I ask.

11:33.993 --> 11:36.461
No. It's a smooth motion.

11:36.562 --> 11:38.894
You follow through
with your racket.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.325
Uh-oh.

11:45.771 --> 11:47.671
You know, this is such a beautiful day.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.741
I don't know why we don't
operate outside more often.

11:52.178 --> 11:55.739
Time of death, 10:15.

12:01.153 --> 12:03.053
Good news, honey.

12:03.155 --> 12:05.749
I found a way to prove
to the town we're not losers.

12:05.858 --> 12:08.326
I've entered us
in a doubles tournament.

12:08.427 --> 12:12.056
- What? We're not ready to compete.
- Don't worry.

12:12.164 --> 12:14.189
The tournament's not till tomorrow.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.495
Okay, get ready for the serve.

12:18.604 --> 12:21.698
Aaah! Get 'em off! Get 'em off!

12:21.807 --> 12:24.207
How embarrassing.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.972
You take over, Bart.

12:27.079 --> 12:30.480
Lisa! Lisa, beer me.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.915
- I'll be right out, honey.
- Oh, that's okay.

12:33.018 --> 12:35.714
Bart's doing fine.
You just have another beer.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.289
Now, that's the kind of nagging
I can live with.

12:38.390 --> 12:41.018
So Barney's, like,
"You're on your own, dude."

12:41.127 --> 12:43.095
And I'm, like, "Not even."

12:43.195 --> 12:46.926
- I don't know what this
has to do with the Civil War.
- I'm getting to that.

12:50.469 --> 12:54.405
Lookin' good, honey.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.839
I think you and I might
just win this tournament dealie.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.774
Hey, Bart.

12:59.879 --> 13:02.507
Yeah! You got your daddy's hustle.

13:04.450 --> 13:08.784
Too busy to reply, huh?
I know how that goes.

13:08.888 --> 13:11.448
Well, I think I'll go lay out
my clothes for the tournament.

13:15.828 --> 13:17.887
Perfect.

13:23.502 --> 13:26.062
Well, I'm ready for the big tournament.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.664
- Hey there, son.
- Oh, hi, Dad.

13:29.775 --> 13:31.675
With that little outfit on...

13:31.777 --> 13:33.972
everyone's gonna think <i>you're</i>
playing in the tournament.

13:34.079 --> 13:36.240
I <i>am</i> playing in the tournament.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.578
It's gonna be tough
without a partner.

13:38.684 --> 13:41.744
- I've got a partner.
- Well, good for you. Anyone I know?

13:41.854 --> 13:45.950
- Yeah, you know her.
- Oh! Hello, Homer.

13:46.058 --> 13:47.958
Good morning, partner.

13:48.060 --> 13:51.427
Uh, there's something
I should tell you.

13:51.530 --> 13:54.431
The name of Bart's partner? I'm all ears.

13:54.533 --> 13:56.433
Well, actually...

13:56.535 --> 14:00.369
the name of Bart's partner is, uh-

14:00.472 --> 14:04.101
- Yes, darling?
- I'm Bart's partner.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.940
No! No, no, no.
You're <i>my</i> partner.

14:07.046 --> 14:11.312
- Dude, I think the lady's made her decision.
- I'm sorry, Homie.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.681
We'll talk about it later, okay?

14:13.786 --> 14:16.687
No!

14:20.659 --> 14:23.127
Traitors!

14:23.229 --> 14:26.630
Uh-oh. I don't think they saw me.

14:28.334 --> 14:31.167
I'm gonna put my trophy on the mantel.
How about you?

14:31.270 --> 14:33.329
I was thinking mantel too.

14:33.439 --> 14:36.169
Talk about being
on the same wavelength.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.502
<i>Hello, Marge. Hello, Bart.</i>

14:41.614 --> 14:43.514
How are the tennis partners?

14:43.616 --> 14:47.052
Oh, Homie, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings.

14:47.152 --> 14:50.246
Don't touch me.
Your hands feel like salad tongs.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.756
I just wanted to win for once.

14:52.858 --> 14:55.418
Please don't take it as a threat
to your manhood.

14:55.527 --> 14:58.496
My manhood? I never thought of that.

14:58.597 --> 15:01.760
We were good, Dad.
They asked us to play in the Krusty Klassic.

15:01.867 --> 15:05.701
It's for charity. It benefits victims
of balcony collapse.

15:05.804 --> 15:07.704
We can wipe out B.C. In our lifetime.

15:07.806 --> 15:09.706
I don't care about B.C.

15:09.808 --> 15:13.904
I care about M.E. - My enjoyment.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.778
It's obvious what's happening.

15:20.886 --> 15:24.549
I'm being replaced by a younger,
more in-your-face version of me.

15:24.657 --> 15:28.058
Dad, you're just going
through a classic oedipal anxiety.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.253
You remember the story
of Oedipus, don't you?

15:30.362 --> 15:33.820
Well, maybe five bucks
would refresh my memory.

15:33.933 --> 15:37.460
Oedipus killed his father and married his mother.

15:37.569 --> 15:39.696
Ugh! Who pays for that wedding?

15:39.805 --> 15:44.003
I'm just saying you feel threatened
by Bart, but it's all in your head.

15:44.109 --> 15:47.272
You're right. But just to be safe,
maybe I should chain him up.

15:47.379 --> 15:50.712
- Dad, I think you're overreacting.
- I think you're under-reacting.

15:50.816 --> 15:53.216
- This session's over.
- This session's under.

15:53.319 --> 15:55.219
- Good-bye.
- Bad-bye.

15:59.191 --> 16:02.422
No. No! Stay away
from my wife, Bart.

16:08.133 --> 16:12.001
Darling, you're so much "handsomer"
than my first husband.

16:12.104 --> 16:15.073
I may have the looks,
but he's the trophy husband.

16:17.176 --> 16:21.044
He thought that trip
to the guillotine factory was just for fun...

16:21.146 --> 16:23.546
but it was the perfect place to shoot him.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.117
That's the guy.

16:26.218 --> 16:28.152
That's the guy from my dream.

16:28.253 --> 16:31.222
Go ahead and smile, smart guy.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.759
I'm gonna mop you up
like turkey gravy.

16:37.529 --> 16:41.021
Are you sure you want me
to be your doubles partner?

16:41.133 --> 16:45.263
- Absolutely, sweetie.
- And you're not doing it out of spite?

16:45.371 --> 16:47.271
No, of course not.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.364
Now, aim for your mother's heart.

16:49.475 --> 16:53.707
<i>Ew! Dad, I don't want to enter</i>
<i>the tournamentjust to hurt Mom.</i>

16:53.812 --> 16:56.576
Oh, come on.
You've been gunnin' for queen bee...

16:56.682 --> 16:58.582
ever since you buzzed into this hive.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.084
Now serve.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.380
<i>Lisa! Did you make</i>
<i>that awful effigy?</i>

17:05.491 --> 17:07.391
Hey, leave my teammate alone.

17:07.492 --> 17:10.859
Lisa's your teammate?

17:10.963 --> 17:13.056
What's so funny?
I'm better than you.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.792
Now, Lisa, you know that's not true.

17:15.901 --> 17:18.597
How would you know?
Your backhand looks like a rusty gate.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.538
- Well, you little- Come on, Bart.
- Babies.

17:31.150 --> 17:34.347
Telegram for Lisa Simpson.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.580
- Don't listen. It's a trick.
- Dear Lisa.

17:36.688 --> 17:39.452
Psych! Psych, psych, psych.
Signed, super psych.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.355
I think he's trying
to psych you out.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.224
Look, we're all trying
to have dinner...

17:44.329 --> 17:47.127
so why don't we just-
Psych, psych, psych!

17:59.445 --> 18:02.505
Oh, where did you buy
that novelty hand, sir?

18:02.614 --> 18:06.175
This? Oh, it's just fluid collecting.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.778
Hey, hey! What do you think, folks?

18:10.889 --> 18:14.450
I hope I don't get arrested
for... racket earring.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.050
Huh? Huh?

18:16.161 --> 18:18.129
Aw, what do you want?

18:18.230 --> 18:21.358
I'm not gonna do "A" material for charity.

18:21.467 --> 18:24.197
And after all, that is why we're here.

18:25.804 --> 18:28.295
Well, look who's here.

18:28.407 --> 18:31.308
- You two are goin' down.
- No, we're not.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.537
You're going down.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.910
Did you hear that?
She said we're going down.

18:37.015 --> 18:39.074
All we can do is play our very best.

18:39.184 --> 18:42.642
Oh, that's loser talk.

18:42.754 --> 18:47.748
Now I'd like to introduce two of
the tennis world's most unbeatable players-

18:47.860 --> 18:51.023
<i>Venus and Serena Williams.</i>

18:51.130 --> 18:53.724
Unbeatable, eh?

18:53.832 --> 18:56.767
Comin' through! Hey, hi, Otto.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.770
Sorry.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.136
What are you doing?

19:02.241 --> 19:04.937
- That's our dad's seat.
- Hey, that's great.

19:05.043 --> 19:09.104
Listen, I need a new doubles partner.
My little girl's a lead weight.

19:09.214 --> 19:11.239
You're dumping your own daughter?

19:11.350 --> 19:13.841
Yeah, but only to crush
my wife and son.

19:13.952 --> 19:16.250
- That's horrible!
- Yeah, that's pretty low.

19:16.355 --> 19:19.654
- Hmm. You seem less disgusted. Let's go.
- Aaah!

19:19.758 --> 19:22.318
Our next match
is Marge and Bart Simpson-

19:22.427 --> 19:24.588
<i>Boo! You rot!</i>

19:24.696 --> 19:27.358
- Versus Homer and Lisa-
- Bup-bup.

19:27.466 --> 19:30.401
Sorry. That's Homer
and Venus Simpson.

19:32.804 --> 19:35.830
Venus Simpson?
You're replacing me?

19:35.941 --> 19:39.172
Now, Lisa, "dumping"
is such a harsh word.

19:39.278 --> 19:42.441
Let's just say I'm replacing you.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.890
Fifteen love.

19:51.990 --> 19:55.187
Once again, I'm outraged
by this last-minute switch.

19:55.294 --> 19:58.286
We all got problems.
I dropped my cookie.

19:58.397 --> 20:01.525
You sure you wanna risk it?

20:01.633 --> 20:05.433
It's totally unfair for one side
to have a professional player.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.869
All right, all right.
You guys can have Serena.

20:07.973 --> 20:12.205
I just ate a personal pizza.

20:12.311 --> 20:15.712
- You're dumping me?
- Honey, I'll make it up to you in bottle rockets.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.946
Okay, swing. Run.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.284
Hit the thing. Now run across the-

20:24.389 --> 20:27.517
- Yeah.
- Whoopsie.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.094
Marge, how bad do you wanna win?

20:30.195 --> 20:32.220
Oh. Oh, I'd do anything.

20:32.331 --> 20:34.799
Good. Yo, Pete. Pete Sampras.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.527
- Hmm?
- <i>Get over here.</i>

20:36.635 --> 20:39.035
Yes! I'm in.

20:39.137 --> 20:42.766
Hmm?

20:42.874 --> 20:45.399
Everybody's been dumped but me.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.410
I'm "un-dumpable."

20:47.512 --> 20:49.946
- Yoink.
- My tennis stick.

20:50.048 --> 20:52.107
- Who are you?
- I'm Andre Agassi.

20:52.217 --> 20:56.210
- The wrestler?
- Come on, tubby. Get off the court. Scat!

20:56.321 --> 20:59.518
Come on, let's play.
I've gotta tape a Ho Hos commercial.

21:06.231 --> 21:10.065
- Which one am I, Serena or Venus?
- You're Andre. I'm Serena.

21:10.168 --> 21:12.363
You're a girl.

21:12.471 --> 21:16.305
Why don't we stop this nonsense?
I'm not mad anymore.

21:16.408 --> 21:20.401
Me neither. I'm just enjoying
some world-class tennis.

21:20.512 --> 21:23.447
You know, there's a lesson
here for all of us-

21:23.548 --> 21:27.985
- It's better to watch stuff than to do stuff.
- Amen.

21:28.086 --> 21:32.022
After the tournament,
let's go out for a nice family dinner.

21:32.124 --> 21:35.457
Courtesy of Pete Sampras.

21:35.560 --> 21:39.223
D-oh! Sorry.

21:39.398 --> 21:41.958
<i>Sucker.</i>

22:24.710 --> 22:26.678
Shh!
