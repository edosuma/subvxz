LOUIE:
 <i>I waited till everybody</i>
 <i>was over at Mario's</i>

01:20.234 --> 01:23.868
 <i>because I didn't want to take</i>
 <i>any more razzing over this.</i>

01:23.901 --> 01:25.767
Now, you say this
poison works

01:25.801 --> 01:27.467
on all kinds
of cockroaches

01:27.501 --> 01:29.567
because I got
a monster in there.

01:29.601 --> 01:30.734
A monster.

01:30.767 --> 01:33.267
No insect can survive
this poison.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.934
Respect your foe.

01:35.968 --> 01:38.901
We're not talking
about just any insect.

01:38.934 --> 01:42.567
This is the biggest
cockroach in the world.

01:42.601 --> 01:45.100
I'm telling you, he
barks at the mailman.

01:45.133 --> 01:48.334
Don't worry about it, Mac.

01:48.367 --> 01:49.501
I'll get him.

01:49.534 --> 01:50.701
Take no prisoners.

01:50.734 --> 01:52.234
Right.

01:52.267 --> 01:55.133
Describe to me again
what this stuff does to him.

01:55.167 --> 01:56.567
Well, it, uh,

01:56.601 --> 01:59.501
paralyzes the central
nervous system,

01:59.534 --> 02:01.801
blocking
and then causing cessation

02:01.834 --> 02:03.868
of all
the metabolic functions.

02:03.901 --> 02:06.167
At least,
that's what the can says.

02:08.199 --> 02:11.701
As long as I can see his little
feelers twitching in the air,

02:11.734 --> 02:13.934
I don't care how you do it.

02:20.601 --> 02:21.734
Oh...

02:21.767 --> 02:24.067
( <i>speaking</i>
 <i>native language</i> )

02:24.100 --> 02:25.400
Excuse me,
Latka?

02:25.434 --> 02:26.567
I said, oh...

02:26.601 --> 02:28.534
( <i>speaking native</i>
 <i>language</i> )

02:28.567 --> 02:30.834
Is something
wrong, Latka?

02:30.868 --> 02:33.601
I enjoy watching her.

02:33.634 --> 02:36.701
ALEX:
Oh, yes, she's
very enjoyable.

02:36.734 --> 02:38.834
Yeah, she has been
in here before.

02:38.868 --> 02:41.868
Each time she gets more
beautiful than the last.

02:41.901 --> 02:44.167
Look at the way
she sits on the stool

02:44.200 --> 02:45.434
like a princess.

02:45.467 --> 02:46.634
ELAINE:
Oh...

02:46.667 --> 02:47.634
You got a little
crush on her,

02:47.667 --> 02:48.634
don't you, Latka?

02:48.667 --> 02:50.300
Why didn't
you tell us, huh?

02:50.334 --> 02:52.801
It brings me
too much pain.

02:52.834 --> 02:55.334
She doesn't know
I'm alive.

02:55.367 --> 02:57.133
Can't she tell
you're alive

02:57.167 --> 02:59.634
by the way you move
around and talk and stuff?

03:04.567 --> 03:05.868
Huh?

03:05.901 --> 03:07.033
Hey, Latka,

03:07.067 --> 03:09.234
just go over there
and introduce yourself.

03:09.267 --> 03:10.901
Say hi, she may
like your style.

03:10.934 --> 03:12.400
No, I could not
do that.

03:12.434 --> 03:14.100
Why not, Latka?
Why not?

03:14.133 --> 03:15.734
Well, how do
I say this?

03:15.767 --> 03:18.434
You see, I do not have
too much success

03:18.467 --> 03:20.100
with American women.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.334
You see,
the men from my country

03:22.367 --> 03:24.100
are not,
for some reason,

03:24.133 --> 03:26.901
attractive to the women
in your country.

03:26.934 --> 03:29.067
We do not,
as a matter of fact,

03:29.100 --> 03:32.234
have much luck
with the women in my country.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.167
Latka, if I were you,

03:35.200 --> 03:37.467
I'd go over there
and say hello.

03:37.501 --> 03:38.801
Bobby, if I were you,

03:38.834 --> 03:40.801
I would go over
and say hello.

03:40.834 --> 03:42.534
But, unfortunately,
I am me.

03:42.567 --> 03:45.734
Oh, what kind of
attitude is that, Latka?

03:45.767 --> 03:47.734
Come on, you are
an attractive person

03:47.767 --> 03:49.234
with a lot to offer.

03:49.267 --> 03:50.434
Remember that.
Yeah.

03:50.467 --> 03:53.601
( <i>all talking at once</i> )

03:53.634 --> 03:55.567
By golly,
I will do it.

03:55.601 --> 03:56.801
ALL:
All right.

03:56.834 --> 03:58.734
Tomorrow.

03:58.767 --> 04:00.767
( <i>all groan</i> )

04:00.801 --> 04:03.100
Tomorrow,
first thing, I promise.

04:03.133 --> 04:05.300
BOBBY:
Latka, there is no time
like the present.

04:05.334 --> 04:06.767
No, wait.
Come on.

04:06.801 --> 04:08.534
ALEX:
Wait, wait, guys, guys!

04:08.567 --> 04:10.100
Come on,
don't force him.

04:10.133 --> 04:11.934
Let him make up
his own mind.

04:11.968 --> 04:13.601
Alex.
What?

04:13.634 --> 04:14.834
Mind your
own business.
Mind my own business.

04:14.868 --> 04:16.067
Come on, guys.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.701
Okay, now, you're going
to do fine, Latka.

04:17.733 --> 04:18.733
Shh.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.501
Hello, I am Latka Gravas.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.868
You're what?

04:48.300 --> 04:52.067
Hello, I am Latka Gravas.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.701
That is my name--

04:54.734 --> 04:57.100
Latka Gravas.

04:57.133 --> 04:59.834
I think you are
very pretty American woman.

04:59.868 --> 05:01.334
Oh, well, thank you.

05:01.367 --> 05:05.033
Maybe could I please
have a drink with you?

05:05.067 --> 05:07.033
Or food?

05:07.067 --> 05:08.701
Or... or even gum?

05:08.734 --> 05:09.901
Bubble gum?

05:09.934 --> 05:12.834
I'm really not interested.

05:12.868 --> 05:14.100
Thank you.

05:14.133 --> 05:16.901
Then I guess it will
not be necessary for us

05:16.934 --> 05:19.334
to look for a house
over the weekend.

05:20.367 --> 05:22.000
Yeah.

05:22.033 --> 05:24.067
Okay.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.667
Well, bye-bye.

05:25.701 --> 05:28.434
It was nice meeting you.

05:31.767 --> 05:34.934
Boy, it sure is
a long walk back.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.400
ELAINE:
Sorry, Latka.

05:38.434 --> 05:39.634
BOBBY:
She shot you down, huh?

05:39.667 --> 05:41.033
Yeah, she shot me down.

05:41.067 --> 05:43.400
BOBBY:
Ah, she didn't even
give you a chance.

05:43.434 --> 05:44.567
That stinks.

05:44.601 --> 05:46.167
It's all right,
I forgive her.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.367
Yeah, well, I don't.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.534
There's such a thing as
sensitivity to other people.

05:49.567 --> 05:50.834
I think I'm gonna
go over there

05:50.868 --> 05:52.067
and tell
Miss High-and-Mighty

05:52.100 --> 05:53.400
where to get off.

05:53.434 --> 05:54.567
Hey, wait a minute, Bob.

05:54.601 --> 05:55.734
Let it go, will you?
Alex, it's okay,

05:55.767 --> 05:57.767
I'm not going
to make a scene.

05:57.801 --> 06:00.434
It's just I can't
let this thing rest.

06:00.467 --> 06:01.534
You know, Latka,

06:01.567 --> 06:03.400
I bet it has nothing
to do with you.

06:03.434 --> 06:05.868
You know, I bet that
she's committed somewhere.

06:05.901 --> 06:07.701
You know, she's
engaged or married,

06:07.734 --> 06:09.501
or, you know,
living with someone.

06:10.534 --> 06:11.834
Okay.

06:11.868 --> 06:13.834
( <i>chuckles</i> )

06:13.868 --> 06:15.400
She needs a cab.

06:15.434 --> 06:17.000
Yeah, I-I'm just
going to give her

06:17.033 --> 06:19.434
a ride home, professionally,
and talk about Latka

06:19.467 --> 06:20.767
all the way.
Hey, now...

06:20.801 --> 06:22.000
Alex, what can I do?

06:22.033 --> 06:23.334
She needs a cab, huh?

06:23.367 --> 06:24.968
Hey, Latka, if it bothers you,

06:25.000 --> 06:26.567
listen, I'll forget
about it right now.

06:26.601 --> 06:28.567
Oh, no, you don't
worry about it, Bobby.

06:28.601 --> 06:31.234
You just go and have a wonderful
time with the woman

06:31.267 --> 06:34.534
who makes every tissue
in my body scream with desire.

06:34.567 --> 06:36.801
Okay,
thanks a lot, Latka.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.100
Boy, what a nice person.

06:42.934 --> 06:44.501
Ooh, look at this.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.534
Get a load of this one.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.567
Ooh.

06:48.601 --> 06:50.434
Hey, Latka,
what are you doing,

06:50.467 --> 06:52.000
reading <i>Playboy</i> magazine?

06:52.033 --> 06:53.968
Oh, yes,
I am studying it, Alex.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.901
I want to be
up front with you.

06:55.934 --> 06:58.601
I want to be
an American fun guy

06:58.634 --> 07:01.000
taking each day in high gear.

07:01.033 --> 07:03.300
Did I say that right?

07:03.334 --> 07:04.801
I hope not.

07:04.834 --> 07:06.767
Well, what's
the point?

07:06.801 --> 07:08.968
Well, the point is

07:09.000 --> 07:12.033
that I am sick
of you all calling me

07:12.067 --> 07:14.267
a cute, little foreigner.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.501
We don't call you a
cute little foreigner.

07:16.534 --> 07:18.801
Well, maybe not to my face,
but behind my back.

07:18.834 --> 07:21.100
Uh-uh, we don't call you that
behind your back.

07:21.133 --> 07:24.100
Well, maybe you don't say it
out loud, but you think it.

07:24.133 --> 07:25.634
We don't even think it.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.167
Oh, yeah?

07:27.200 --> 07:30.868
Well, how about the time
Tony said his uncle was broke,

07:30.901 --> 07:34.133
and I said, "Well, why doesn't
he go to the doctor?"

07:34.167 --> 07:35.367
Yeah, that was kind of cute.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.701
See, "cute" again.

07:36.734 --> 07:38.067
Everything always cute.

07:38.100 --> 07:40.567
I am sick of being cute.
When will it end?

07:40.601 --> 07:42.601
But Latka, I don't see how
reading a bunch of magazines

07:42.634 --> 07:44.334
is going to make you
more sophisticated?

07:44.367 --> 07:47.934
Well, Alex, I am not
only going to read it,

07:47.968 --> 07:51.801
I am going to take a vacation
from the garage,

07:51.834 --> 07:54.367
I am going
to lock myself in,

07:54.400 --> 07:56.133
every spare minute,

07:56.167 --> 07:59.334
I am going
to study this <i>Playboy.</i>

07:59.367 --> 08:01.167
Mm-hmm.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.734
And I have a tape
of an F.M. D.J.

08:04.767 --> 08:08.634
I am going to learn
to talk like him

08:08.667 --> 08:12.167
so that
when women hear my voice,

08:12.200 --> 08:14.567
they will just relax.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.167
See, I will do it

08:17.200 --> 08:20.067
even if it takes me eight days.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.701
Look, here it is.

08:22.734 --> 08:25.067
I have it marked.

08:25.100 --> 08:29.400
I am going to...
"alter my lifestyle

08:29.434 --> 08:32.400
to fit the fast lane."

08:33.868 --> 08:35.534
Huh?

08:35.567 --> 08:41.767
( <i>voice deepens</i> ):
"Alter my lifestyle
to fit the fast lane."

08:43.100 --> 08:48.767
( <i>voice deepens</i> ):
"Alter my lifestyle
to fit the fast lane."

08:48.801 --> 08:53.400
( <i>voice deepens</i> ):
"Alter my lifestyle
to fit the fast lane."

08:53.434 --> 08:59.601
( <i>accent lessens</i> ):
"Alter my lifestyle
to fit the fast lane."

09:04.601 --> 09:07.801
( <i>without accent</i> ):
"Alter my lifestyle
to fit the fast...

09:07.834 --> 09:09.567
( <i>normal voice</i> ):
...lane." Whoop!

09:19.000 --> 09:20.801
There, that ought
to do it.

09:20.834 --> 09:22.434
Now... now,
how soon is it safe

09:22.467 --> 09:23.868
to go back in there?

09:23.901 --> 09:26.133
Well, that depends on
your system, you know.

09:26.167 --> 09:29.167
Some people, they go in there
the first day, they get sick.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.000
Other people
might get a headache.

09:31.033 --> 09:33.968
Me, I like it.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
All right.

09:38.033 --> 09:40.467
Thanks, pal.

09:44.267 --> 09:45.567
Ha!

09:45.601 --> 09:48.067
It's great
to have the cage back.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.400
All right.

09:49.434 --> 09:52.501
It's worth every penny
for the piece of mind.

09:52.534 --> 09:54.100
Come on in here, Jeff.

09:55.100 --> 09:56.934
I'm starving.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.100
Sandwich.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.234
Mustard.

10:05.267 --> 10:07.234
* No bugs allowed 

10:07.267 --> 10:10.067
* No bugs allowed 

10:10.100 --> 10:13.267
* No bugs allowed. 

10:18.601 --> 10:20.934
Jeff...

10:24.601 --> 10:27.434
( <i>talking indistinctly</i> )

10:27.467 --> 10:28.601
It's Karen.

10:28.634 --> 10:30.334
The princess
is honoring us

10:30.367 --> 10:31.467
with her
presence.

10:31.501 --> 10:33.000
I bet you
she's insulted

10:33.033 --> 10:36.934
we're not groveling
at her feet.

10:36.968 --> 10:38.234
Oh, you're
handling rejection

10:38.267 --> 10:41.501
so much better
than you used to, Bobby.

10:41.534 --> 10:42.701
TONY:
Hey, guys. Hey, guys.

10:42.734 --> 10:44.133
Latka's back
from his vacation.

10:44.167 --> 10:45.467
He's on his way
in right now.

10:45.501 --> 10:46.734
I got to pick a good spot

10:46.767 --> 10:48.901
so I can see all your faces
when you first see him.

10:48.934 --> 10:50.934
I got it. Go ahead.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.167
ELAINE:
Oh, my God.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.067
What did
I tell you?

11:07.100 --> 11:08.601
ALEX:
Latka?

11:13.400 --> 11:15.701
( <i>without accent</i> ):
Hey, I love you guys,
you're beautiful.

11:15.734 --> 11:17.067
( <i>clicks tongue</i> )

11:21.868 --> 11:23.968
Hey, Tommy,
making any money?

11:25.033 --> 11:26.300
Latka?

11:26.334 --> 11:28.634
What kind of
imported beer you got?

11:30.467 --> 11:31.501
Schlitz.

11:32.968 --> 11:34.267
Schlitz.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.300
I love you, Tommy,
you're a mug.

11:36.334 --> 11:38.234
Give me one of those.

11:42.801 --> 11:43.968
Thanks.

12:16.467 --> 12:18.067
I can take one look at you

12:18.100 --> 12:21.567
and tell that you've heard
every phony line in the book...

12:21.601 --> 12:24.501
so one more isn't going
to hurt you, right?

12:24.534 --> 12:25.934
( <i>laughing</i> )

12:25.968 --> 12:29.234
( <i>laughing</i> )

12:29.267 --> 12:30.734
She's laughing.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.767
Ah...

12:33.801 --> 12:35.067
but seriously now.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.100
The first few moments
of a relationship

12:37.133 --> 12:38.834
set the tone
for the whole thing,

12:38.868 --> 12:40.167
if you know what I mean,

12:40.200 --> 12:42.033
so let's be honest.

12:42.067 --> 12:43.534
My name is Vic.

12:44.567 --> 12:47.067
I'm into Italian cars,
Technics stereos,

12:47.100 --> 12:50.133
Australian films
and beautiful ladies.

12:51.367 --> 12:53.434
If you're interested,
let's talk.

12:53.467 --> 12:55.901
If not, it's been fun.

12:55.934 --> 12:57.200
Vic, huh?

12:57.234 --> 12:58.734
No, not "Vic, huh?"--

12:58.767 --> 13:00.167
Vic Ferrari.

13:04.567 --> 13:06.067
Vic Ferrari?

13:06.100 --> 13:08.000
That isn't your
real name, is it?

13:08.033 --> 13:09.200
Why don't you tell me

13:09.234 --> 13:11.167
after you see how I perform
on a tight corner.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.200
( <i>laughing</i> )

13:12.234 --> 13:14.033
Terrible humor, Vic,

13:14.067 --> 13:16.434
but I love that smile.

13:16.467 --> 13:20.300
Come on, walk with me,
talk with me.

13:25.601 --> 13:27.767
Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

13:27.801 --> 13:29.767
It's like Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hekyll.

13:29.801 --> 13:31.901
Latka.

13:31.934 --> 13:35.067
Excuse me, I think these
people have mistaken me

13:35.100 --> 13:36.234
for someone else.

13:36.267 --> 13:37.534
I'm a dime a dozen.

13:37.567 --> 13:41.367
Don't you believe it.

13:42.367 --> 13:43.734
Be right back.

13:43.767 --> 13:45.467
All right,
Latka, way to go.

13:45.501 --> 13:46.701
You got her, buddy.

13:46.734 --> 13:48.868
Hey, she's a woman, not a prize.

13:48.901 --> 13:50.200
Hey, I love you guys,

13:50.234 --> 13:52.968
but I don't like your
"keeping score" attitude.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.534
Latka, she can't
hear you now.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.000
You can drop the act.

13:56.033 --> 13:57.234
The act?

13:57.267 --> 13:58.734
Hey, man, you got it backwards.

13:58.767 --> 14:00.133
I dropped my act.

14:00.167 --> 14:02.667
You guys could stand
to do the same thing.

14:02.701 --> 14:04.934
Hey, Elaine.

14:04.968 --> 14:08.133
You're looking dynamite tonight.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.567
Corny, but sincere.

14:13.601 --> 14:15.234
( <i>laughing</i> )

14:15.267 --> 14:17.734
( <i>clicks tongue</i> )
 Gotcha.

14:19.901 --> 14:21.701
Come on, let's go, honey.

14:21.734 --> 14:24.300
Poor, Latka.

14:24.334 --> 14:25.567
What do you mean, Jim?

14:25.601 --> 14:30.133
Everybody's beating time
with his woman.

14:30.167 --> 14:32.567
First Bobby,
and now that jerk.

14:48.467 --> 14:49.634
Latka!

14:51.133 --> 14:52.300
Latka!

14:55.801 --> 14:57.133
Latka!

14:58.734 --> 15:00.067
Latka!

15:00.100 --> 15:01.367
( <i>growling</i> )

15:02.400 --> 15:04.667
( <i>yells</i> )

15:04.701 --> 15:08.901
( <i>as Vic Ferrari</i> ):
Hey, man, what is your problem?

15:13.734 --> 15:16.534
I don't like people playing
music in this garage.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.133
Well,
I don't like this authority trip

15:18.167 --> 15:19.667
that you're always
laying on me, man.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.934
Hey, you just wasted
Elvis Costello.

15:24.434 --> 15:26.534
Latka, you're getting
weirder every day.

15:26.567 --> 15:28.434
Now, I don't want
to have to fire you

15:28.467 --> 15:30.567
for this, because...

15:30.601 --> 15:34.067
I don't want to
have to fire you...

15:34.100 --> 15:37.501
I was hoping
to fire you just for no reason.

15:37.534 --> 15:39.200
Look, you
better wise up.

15:39.234 --> 15:41.734
Knock it off.

15:41.767 --> 15:44.367
And try wearing
some decent clothes to work.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.300
You look like a foreign banana.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.100
Well...

15:54.133 --> 15:56.601
time for
my sparkling water break.

15:56.634 --> 15:57.968
Anybody want some?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.868
He's not coming
out of this.

16:01.901 --> 16:03.300
If anything,
it's getting worse.

16:03.334 --> 16:04.834
It's been going
on for a week now,

16:04.868 --> 16:06.167
night and day.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.501
Maybe somebody
should talk to him.

16:07.534 --> 16:08.801
Hey, I tried.

16:08.834 --> 16:11.934
He just keeps telling me
I'm one dynamite lady.

16:11.968 --> 16:14.801
I keep telling him
that's beside the point.

16:14.834 --> 16:16.701
( <i>mumbling and phone ringing</i> )

16:16.734 --> 16:18.534
...get an answering service.

16:18.567 --> 16:19.868
Hello.

16:19.901 --> 16:21.067
Yeah, Vic's here.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.300
Hold on a second.

16:22.334 --> 16:25.067
Hey, Latka,
it's Karen for you.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.300
I'm not here.

16:27.334 --> 16:30.534
Latka, it's the girl
you're crazy about, remember?

16:30.567 --> 16:35.000
Hey, I am out man, read my lips.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.367
Uh, yeah,
no, he's not here.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.834
Yeah, okay, sure.

16:44.868 --> 16:47.467
I'll tell him
you called. Bye.

16:50.934 --> 16:52.567
Latka, what's going on?

16:52.601 --> 16:54.567
It's over between
her and me.

16:54.601 --> 16:56.367
You see, Karen is
the kind of chick

16:56.400 --> 16:57.801
who craves rejection

16:57.834 --> 16:59.701
and goes around
creating it for herself.

16:59.734 --> 17:03.033
So what's a boy to do?

17:06.233 --> 17:08.701
This is too much.

17:08.733 --> 17:11.267
Latka, we got to talk to you.

17:11.300 --> 17:12.666
Hey...

17:12.701 --> 17:15.166
you know I always have time
to talk to you, Elaine.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.733
You're one dynamite lady.

17:17.767 --> 17:19.567
Latka, shut up.

17:19.601 --> 17:22.067
Ooh-hoo, redheads.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.133
I'm glad you feel

17:24.166 --> 17:26.267
that you can be
so honest with me like that.

17:26.300 --> 17:28.601
Latka, come here
and sit down, okay?

17:36.100 --> 17:37.734
Hey, Latka, Latka,
you're weird.

17:37.767 --> 17:39.200
Hey, we're all coming

17:39.234 --> 17:40.767
from a different direction,

17:40.801 --> 17:43.000
and sometimes
it doesn't get in synch.

17:43.033 --> 17:45.400
Sorry about that,
but you had it coming.

17:49.133 --> 17:51.033
Latka, can't you see
what's going on?

17:51.067 --> 17:53.133
Can't you see
what you're doing to yourself?

17:53.167 --> 17:55.534
Yeah, I'm assimilating.

17:55.567 --> 17:57.934
Hey, Latka, why don't
you come off it, huh?

17:57.968 --> 18:00.267
Hey, if I have to be
a cute little guy

18:00.300 --> 18:01.901
who strikes out every time

18:01.934 --> 18:04.467
in order to be Mr. Popularity
around here,

18:04.501 --> 18:07.400
well then
you can just keep your trophy.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.467
Would you just stop it?

18:10.501 --> 18:11.701
Well, excuse me.

18:11.734 --> 18:14.701
I thought that I had
the right to evolve,

18:14.734 --> 18:17.734
but I'm sensing
a lot of hostility here.

18:17.767 --> 18:21.567
Fortunately,
I got my friend Alex.

18:25.067 --> 18:27.067
My man, Alex.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.901
With a heart
as big as his schnoz

18:29.934 --> 18:32.834
and a brain
as sharp as his profile.

18:32.868 --> 18:34.334
Yeah, well, I'm
very flattered.

18:34.367 --> 18:35.501
Very flattered.

18:35.534 --> 18:36.667
Hey, man, you understand

18:36.701 --> 18:38.033
what I'm talking about,
don't ya?

18:38.067 --> 18:39.400
Yes, I think I do.

18:39.434 --> 18:40.534
Yeah.

18:40.567 --> 18:42.501
God bless the people.

18:42.534 --> 18:44.200
Adios, kids.

18:44.234 --> 18:45.367
Hey, where you going?

18:45.400 --> 18:46.534
Hey, come on back.

18:46.567 --> 18:48.133
Hey, man, don't leave me.

18:48.167 --> 18:49.367
Come on.
I tell ya, Latka,

18:49.400 --> 18:51.567
I've been going back
and forth about this thing,

18:51.601 --> 18:53.868
because I think maybe
you're justified in thinking

18:53.901 --> 18:56.033
that there was
a patronizing element

18:56.067 --> 18:58.601
in the way people used
to treat the old Latka.

18:58.634 --> 19:00.834
But the thing that keeps
coming through to me is

19:00.868 --> 19:02.133
I like that old Latka,

19:02.167 --> 19:04.834
and I don't like you.

19:10.868 --> 19:14.400
Ooh, hard to get happy
after that one.

19:22.234 --> 19:24.167
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

19:33.200 --> 19:34.501
Hey, Alex,

19:34.534 --> 19:36.167
I think we've got some
head-butting to do.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.000
You dropped a real load
of guano on me today,

19:38.033 --> 19:39.667
and I think we should
get out our shovels

19:39.701 --> 19:41.067
and see if we can...

19:44.767 --> 19:47.334
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

19:48.367 --> 19:51.234
( <i>knocking continues</i> )

19:54.400 --> 19:55.834
Please, don't slam
the door on me again,

19:55.868 --> 19:57.367
because I don't think
I could take that.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.834
I really want to talk to you.

19:58.868 --> 20:00.801
What do you have to say
you haven't said already?

20:05.567 --> 20:07.534
I cry at night.

20:08.701 --> 20:10.801
Alex, please help me,
you've got to help me.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.000
I don't know what to do.

20:12.033 --> 20:13.367
I'm stuck inside of here.
I don't like this guy.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.534
I don't remember
how I got in.
No, no, no.

20:14.567 --> 20:15.801
I'll help you, I'll help you,
I'll help you.

20:15.834 --> 20:17.667
Listen, just sit down.
Just sit down.

20:17.701 --> 20:19.100
I don't like
the fast lane.

20:19.133 --> 20:21.200
Well, I understand that.

20:21.234 --> 20:22.801
Well, can't you just stop it?

20:22.834 --> 20:24.400
I mean, be the guy
you used to be.

20:24.434 --> 20:26.033
Talk like you used to talk.

20:26.067 --> 20:27.767
I don't remember
how I used to talk.

20:27.801 --> 20:29.267
You don't remember?

20:29.300 --> 20:30.701
Think.

20:30.734 --> 20:33.367
I... I remember
I was a cute little guy.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.701
I had some kind of an accent.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.234
But I've worked at it so hard

20:37.267 --> 20:38.934
I've been doing it for so long,

20:38.968 --> 20:41.534
I just don't remember
what I used to sound like.

20:41.567 --> 20:43.100
Well, not much different
than you do now.

20:44.801 --> 20:45.934
You remember?

20:45.968 --> 20:47.267
Latka Gravas.

20:47.300 --> 20:50.133
( <i>higher voice</i> ):
Latka Gravas, <i>Ibeda.</i>

20:51.801 --> 20:53.000
Yeah.

20:53.033 --> 20:57.767
Yeah, I do remember
"Latka Gravas, <i>Ibeda."</i>

20:57.801 --> 20:59.834
I'll try it.

20:59.868 --> 21:03.434
Okay, Latka Gravas.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.334
 <i>Ibeda.</i>

21:11.400 --> 21:14.501
Oh, it's no use, Alex,
I can't cut it.

21:14.534 --> 21:16.167
I can't, I went too far.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.667
I don't remember
what I sounded like.

21:18.701 --> 21:21.734
I can't sound like him anymore
so this is it.

21:21.767 --> 21:24.367
From here on in, the highway's
full of honky-tonks

21:24.400 --> 21:27.400
and one-nighters and no place
to go when the bars close.

21:27.434 --> 21:28.734
No, no, no, no, no.

21:28.767 --> 21:29.968
No, it doesn't
have to be that way.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.801
Oh, come on, cadet,
stop the snowfall.

21:31.834 --> 21:33.367
I can take the truth.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.901
Latka, Latka, just calm down.

21:35.934 --> 21:37.901
Don't try so hard.

21:37.934 --> 21:40.067
I mean, just trust
that Latka's in there,

21:40.100 --> 21:41.534
that he'll come out.

21:41.567 --> 21:42.534
Just trust it
and relax.

21:42.567 --> 21:43.634
No way, buddy boy.

21:43.667 --> 21:45.601
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

21:45.634 --> 21:47.868
Now, remember, Latka
was a kind of quiet guy.

21:47.901 --> 21:49.100
Trust me.

21:49.133 --> 21:51.767
Just be quiet, just relax, okay?

21:51.801 --> 21:52.968
Mm-hmm.
Think.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.667
He's in there somewhere?

21:54.701 --> 21:55.968
Right.

21:58.834 --> 22:01.234
Come on, Latka.

22:01.267 --> 22:02.968
Come on out, Latka.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.968
I know you're in there
somewhere.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.267
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.601
All right.

22:34.534 --> 22:36.267
Latka.

22:36.300 --> 22:37.334
Yes, yes, yes.

22:37.367 --> 22:38.267
Good, good, good.

22:39.267 --> 22:41.234
Right, right, right,
right, right.

22:41.267 --> 22:43.234
You got it.

22:43.267 --> 22:44.634
( <i>as Latka</i> ):
Alex?
Yes, Latka.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.534
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

22:46.567 --> 22:48.200
Oh, there's so much
I want to tell you

22:48.234 --> 22:50.200
that has happened to me
since I last saw you.

22:50.234 --> 22:51.901
