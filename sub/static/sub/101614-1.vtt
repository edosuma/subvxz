59:17.638 --> 59:19.473
Are you Jew?

59:19.556 --> 59:21.225
Yeah, I’m Jewish, yeah.

59:21.308 --> 59:24.687
Very nice weather, uh,
we have been controlling.

59:24.770 --> 59:26.105
You are Jewish?

59:26.188 --> 59:29.233
Um... y-yes.

59:29.316 --> 59:31.235
No, you are not Jewish.

59:32.319 --> 59:35.322
Listen, don’t-don’t be
afraid of me.

59:35.406 --> 59:37.574
But please don’t eat me alive.

59:37.658 --> 59:40.077
Uh, do I look like I eat people?

59:40.160 --> 59:42.830
-Uh...
-I’m a old, good woman.

59:42.913 --> 59:44.206
Yes.

59:44.290 --> 59:46.292
-Look at me. I’m Jewish.
-Yeah.

59:46.375 --> 59:47.960
Do I have a long nose?

59:48.043 --> 59:50.254
-Look at me.
-No.

59:50.337 --> 59:51.964
You can touch my nose.

59:52.047 --> 59:54.091
-What?
-Look at me.

59:54.174 --> 59:56.677
You see? Is it long?

59:56.760 --> 59:58.721
-No, it’s a small one.
-Exactly like yours.

59:58.804 --> 59:59.888

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:07.688
So we are normal,
exactly like you.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:10.691
Okay, then, use your venom
on me and finish me.

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:13.444

-Mmm.

01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:45.851
I want to hear your story,
my dear.

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:47.895
This is the worst story

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:51.315

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:53.150
or Jew.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:58.489
I came here on a simple mission
to save my country by delivering

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:01.450
our number one televiski star
Johnny the Monkey

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:04.161
as a gift to Michael Pence.

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:06.622
And I’m sure you’ve figured out
what happen next.

01:01:06.705 --> 01:01:11.377
My daughter had smuggled herself
into the crate,

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:15.464
and yes, you got it,
she’d eaten the monkey.

01:01:15.547 --> 01:01:18.384
Although I believe
he probably eat himself.

01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:20.594
There are bad stories out there.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.763
Listen, you want
to hear my story,

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.681
-when I was a little child?
-Yes, what is your story?

01:01:24.765 --> 01:01:27.184
I was in the Holocaust.
You see me?

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:28.936
I was in the Holocaust.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:30.562
