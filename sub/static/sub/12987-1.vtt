(woman) He looks great.
That Al Conti is a genius.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.721
I am a genius.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.974
I am a genius!

03:04.142 --> 03:07.227
So, how come you can't
keep track of your receipts?

03:07.395 --> 03:11.064
How am I supposed to do your income
tax with this mess you've got here?

03:11.232 --> 03:14.985
Numbers, taxes, receipts...

03:15.153 --> 03:18.113
I make 'em look better
than they did in real life.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.241
I'm an artistic genius.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.952
Then, how come
you've got butter on your tie?

03:24.704 --> 03:27.789
- (grunts)
- Give it here!

03:28.333 --> 03:30.125
You know what? I give you this.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.252
You make good coffee.

03:32.962 --> 03:35.214
You're a slob, but you make good coffee.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.674
(man #2) Ah, red roses.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.303
Very romantic, huh?

03:42.597 --> 03:47.267
Ah, the guy that sends these
really knows what he's doing.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.478
The guy who sends those
spends a lot of money...

03:49.646 --> 03:52.189
...on something that ends up as garbage.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.608
I'm glad everybody ain't like you,
Loretta.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.151
I'd be out of business.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.487
What are you talking? I love flowers.

04:10.708 --> 04:11.750
Thanks, Carmine.

04:18.632 --> 04:19.591
Are you ready?

04:19.759 --> 04:21.843
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?

04:22.011 --> 04:23.303
Very good, Mr. Johnny.

04:23.471 --> 04:26.431
We will both have the Ticino salad.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.268
And I'll have special fish.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.646
No, it's oily fish tonight.
Not before the plane ride.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.022
Maybe you're right.

04:34.190 --> 04:37.818
OK, we'll have the manicotti, Bobo.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.028
That'll give you a base
for your stomach.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.322
You eat oily fish,
you go up in the air...

04:42.490 --> 04:45.701
Halfway to Sicily,
you'll be green and sweating.

04:45.868 --> 04:46.910
You look after me.

04:55.044 --> 04:58.046
You'll ruin the evening...
Patricia, please, don't leave.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.257
Do you think I'm a talking doll?!

05:00.425 --> 05:04.428
I was just making a point about
the way you stated your aspirations...

05:04.595 --> 05:07.014
You can kiss my aspirations, Professor!

05:07.724 --> 05:09.975
Kiss my aspirations? Very clever.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.561
The height of cleverness!

05:12.729 --> 05:14.730
(laughter)

05:16.024 --> 05:17.399
Waiter.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.777
Yes?

05:20.945 --> 05:23.822
Would you do away
with any evidence of her...

05:23.990 --> 05:25.324
...and bring me a big glass of vodka?

05:25.491 --> 05:27.242
But absolutely.

05:30.830 --> 05:34.624
A man who can't control his woman...
is funny.

05:34.792 --> 05:37.627
- (giggles)
- She was too young for him.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.213
What's up, Uncle Bobo?

05:40.381 --> 05:42.924
Tonight Mr. Johnny's
gonna propose marriage.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.385
- How do you know?
- He arranged it with me.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.429
When he asks, he's gonna wave...

05:47.597 --> 05:49.890
...and then I serve the champagne.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.892
(sighs)

05:52.060 --> 05:55.062
A good bachelor customer for 20 years.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.191
Mille grazie.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.494
- How's things, hey?
- Fine, Bobo. We'll have the check.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.829
No, no. I uh...

06:13.956 --> 06:15.582
I wanna see the dessert cart.

06:15.750 --> 06:16.708
Very good.

06:16.876 --> 06:20.462
- You never have dessert.
- Never is a long time.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.769
What's the matter with you?

06:37.146 --> 06:40.107
My scalp is not getting
enough blood sometimes.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.402
- Have some dessert.
- No, I shouldn't.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.196
- Will you marry me?
- What?

06:48.825 --> 06:50.283
Will you marry me?

06:51.327 --> 06:52.786
Bobo, take the cart away.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.038
Very good, Miss Loretta.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.041
- Are you proposing marriage to me?
- Yes.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.921
All right. You know I was married
and that my husband died.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.966
What you don't know is
I think he and I had bad luck.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.136
- What do you mean?
- We got married at the City Hall.

07:09.303 --> 07:12.264
- It gave bad luck the whole marriage.
- I don't understand.

07:12.432 --> 07:17.185
Right from the start, we didn't do it
right. Could you kneel down?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.605
- On the floor?
- Yeah, on the floor.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.691
- This is a good suit!
- I know!

07:22.859 --> 07:25.444
I helped you pick it out.
It had two pairs of pants!

07:25.611 --> 07:30.365
It's for luck. A man proposes marriage
to a woman, he should kneel down.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.590
She's got him on his knees!
He's ruining his suit.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.721
Is that man praying?

07:53.973 --> 07:56.266
- So...
- Where's the ring?

07:58.769 --> 08:01.897
- The ring!
- A ring, that's right.

08:02.064 --> 08:04.900
I would have sprung for the ring
if it was me, capisce?

08:06.652 --> 08:10.280
- You could use your pinky ring.
- I like this ring!

08:10.448 --> 08:13.700
You propose marriage to a woman, you
should offer her a ring of engagement.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.462
Loretta...

08:26.881 --> 08:28.840
Loretta Castorini Clark...

08:29.759 --> 08:34.304
...on my knees,
in front of all of these people...

08:35.431 --> 08:36.681
...will you marry me?

08:36.849 --> 08:38.433
Yes, Johnny.

08:38.601 --> 08:43.270
Yes, John Anthony Cammareri,
I will marry you. I will be your wife.

08:51.948 --> 08:55.033
(cheering)

08:56.452 --> 08:57.702
Salute, paesano!

09:01.624 --> 09:02.624
Bobo!

09:02.792 --> 09:06.002
- The check!
- Right away, Mr. Johnny.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.808
What about the wedding?

09:22.436 --> 09:24.437
My mother is dying.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.984
When she's dead, I'll come back
and we'll get married.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.277
How near death is she?

09:31.779 --> 09:33.238
A week.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.031
Two weeks... No more.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.075
How about we set a date? A month?

09:37.243 --> 09:42.664
Must it be so definite? Can't we just
say we'll be married when I get back?

09:42.832 --> 09:44.416
Where? The City Hall? No.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.460
My mother is dying.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.754
I want a whole wedding,
or we'll have bad luck.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.716
For a whole wedding to be planned,
you gotta set a date.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.468
All right, all right. A month.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.679
- A month from today.
- In a month.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.140
- A month from today.
- Yes, from today.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.976
- OK, OK.
- From today, right.

10:03.144 --> 10:06.438
I'll take care of the whole thing.
All you gotta do is show up.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.691

10:18.451 --> 10:19.576
Come on, andiamo.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.412
- Call me when you get in.
- I'll call from Mamma's.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.123
OK. You made me very happy.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.876
There's one thing about this wedding
I want you to do.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.170
I want you to call uh...

10:30.338 --> 10:34.341
Call this number. It's a business
number. You ask for Ronny.

10:34.508 --> 10:37.135
- Invite him to the wedding.
- Who is it?

10:37.303 --> 10:40.597
- It's my younger brother.
- You've got a brother?

10:40.765 --> 10:42.932
We haven't spoken in five years.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.602
There was some bad blood.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.812
I want you to invite him
to the wedding.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.022
- Will you do it?
- Sure.

10:49.190 --> 10:52.525
(PA) Flight 604 for Rome
with connections to Palermo

10:52.693 --> 10:54.861
is now boarding at gate 43.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.405
I gotta go.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.074
Have you got your ticket?

11:02.870 --> 11:06.122
OK. Here, I got you these.
Gum and cough drops.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.416
Gum opens your ears when you chew.

11:08.584 --> 11:09.834
I gotta go.

11:21.806 --> 11:25.642
(PA) This is the last call
for flight No.604 for Rome...

11:31.357 --> 11:33.233
You have someone on that plane?

11:33.401 --> 11:34.734
Yeah. My fiancé.

11:34.902 --> 11:38.947
I put a curse on that plane.
My sister is on that plane.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.240
I put a curse on that plane

11:40.408 --> 11:45.203
that it's going to explode,
burn and fall into the sea.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.790
50 years ago, she stole a man from me.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.167
Si ha preso il mio uomo!

11:51.335 --> 11:54.796
Today she tells me
that she never loved him...

11:54.964 --> 11:57.632
...that she took him to be strong on me.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.884
Now she's going back to Sicily.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.011
Si torna in Sicilia.

12:02.179 --> 12:06.933
I cursed her that the green Atlantic
water should swallow her up!

12:07.727 --> 12:09.102
I don't believe in curses.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.730
Neither do I.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.922
- Mr. Johnny's, right?
- Yeah.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.677
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.220
The key's in it.

12:55.733 --> 12:59.319
What do you mean?!
I've seen the way you look at her...

12:59.487 --> 13:01.321
...and it isn't right!
- How do I look at her?

13:01.489 --> 13:03.448
- Can I help you?
- A split of Mumm.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.367
- So, how do I look at her?
- Like a wolf!

13:08.162 --> 13:11.372
- Like a wolf, huh?
- Uh-huh. Like a wolf.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.708
You've never seen a wolf in your life.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.418
That's $11.99.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.798
I've seen the wolf
in everybody I ever met...

13:19.965 --> 13:22.383
...and I see a wolf in you.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.093
Mm-hm.

13:24.261 --> 13:28.097
- That makes $20. Have a nice night.
- You, too.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.517
- You know what I see in you?
- What?

13:30.684 --> 13:32.352
The girl I married.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.979
- Oh, come on!
- (laughs)

13:35.147 --> 13:36.773
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.234
Goodnight.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.707
I'm getting married.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.751
- Again?
- Yeah.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.003
You did it before
and it didn't work out.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.172
- The guy died.
- What killed him?

16:06.340 --> 16:08.925
- He got hit by a bus.
- No. Bad luck.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.636
You mother and I were married 52 years.
Nobody died.

16:11.804 --> 16:16.432
You were married two years, somebody's
dead. Don't get married again.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.060
- Who's the man?
- Johnny Cammareri.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.687
Jo!

16:20.854 --> 16:23.606
Johnny Cammareri. He's a big baby.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.274
Why isn't he here telling me this?

16:25.442 --> 16:27.860
He's flying to Sicily.
His mother's dying.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.947
More bad luck.
I don't like his face, Loretta.

16:31.115 --> 16:34.283
When he smiles, I can't see his teeth.
What does he hide?

16:34.451 --> 16:36.035
- When are you gonna do it?
- In a month.

16:36.203 --> 16:38.329
- I won't come.
- You've gotta give me away.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.207
- I didn't give you away the first time.
- And I had bad luck!

16:41.375 --> 16:43.960
Maybe, if you gave me away

16:44.128 --> 16:46.421
and I got married in a church
in a wedding dress...

16:46.588 --> 16:49.590
...instead of at the City Hall
with strangers at the door...

16:49.758 --> 16:52.427
...maybe I wouldn't have
had the bad luck I had.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.221
Maybe.

16:55.389 --> 16:59.267
Pop, I had no reception,
no wedding cake, no nothing.

17:00.352 --> 17:03.146
Johnny got down on his knees
and proposed to me at the Grand Ticino.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.440
- He did?
- Yes.

17:05.607 --> 17:08.108
- That don't sound like Johnny.
- Well...

17:09.361 --> 17:11.404
- Where's the ring?
- Here.

17:11.571 --> 17:14.115
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.576
- It's a man's ring!
- It's temporary!

17:16.743 --> 17:19.537
Everything is temporary!
That excuses nothing.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.497
You're coming?

17:24.084 --> 17:25.917
Let's go tell your mother.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.637
Rose.

17:37.264 --> 17:40.641
Rose!

17:42.478 --> 17:43.978
Who's dead?

17:44.146 --> 17:45.480
(Pop) Nobody.

17:45.647 --> 17:48.483
- Loretta's getting married.
- Again?

17:48.650 --> 17:49.734
Yeah.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.903
- Johnny Cammareri.
- I don't like him.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.821
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.116
- Do you love him, Loretta?
- No.

17:57.284 --> 18:01.829
Good. When you love 'em, they drive
you crazy cos they know they can.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.165
- But you like him?
- Oh, yeah.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.084
He's a sweet man, Ma.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.670
This time I'm gonna get married
in a church and have a big reception.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.923
- And who's gonna pay for that?
- Pop.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.426
- What?
- The father of the bride pays.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.594
I have no money.

18:16.762 --> 18:20.014
You're rich as Roosevelt.
You're just cheap.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.307
I won't pay!

18:21.475 --> 18:23.810
It's a father's duty
to pay for the wedding.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.436
I won't pay for nothing.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.688
He didn't used to be cheap.

18:27.856 --> 18:31.109
He thinks if he holds onto his money,
he will never die.

18:31.276 --> 18:35.530
♪ What's done is done
and I tell myself...

18:35.697 --> 18:37.949
Now he's gonna play
that damn Vicki Carr record...

18:38.117 --> 18:40.618
...and when he comes to bed,
he won't touch me.

18:42.454 --> 18:46.374
♪ It's easy when you play it cool...

18:49.294 --> 18:52.088
Dai! Piano, piano!

18:52.756 --> 18:55.174
Ecco, piano.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.478
Hey! Keep your dogs off my lawn!

19:08.897 --> 19:09.897
Come on.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.579
Don't do that!

19:24.746 --> 19:28.916
She's asleep. Look at all the flowers.

19:29.084 --> 19:31.502
My brother sent her a blue flower.

19:32.212 --> 19:37.008
I can only see things in my house.
And things in my house are very bad.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.302
I don't know what to advise my son.

19:39.469 --> 19:42.847
I think he should pay for the wedding.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.766
But it's important
that he don't look ridiculous.

19:45.934 --> 19:48.895
- Why don't you talk to him?
- I will.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.355
I must find the right moment.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.483
- Did you see la bella luna last night?
- Ah, si.

19:54.651 --> 19:58.029
Ah, si, la luna. La bella luna.

19:58.197 --> 20:04.035
The moon uh...
brings the woman to the man, capisci?

20:04.203 --> 20:07.872
La luna attira I'uomo...
la donna verso I'uomo.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.499
- Avete capito?
- (mumbling)

20:10.667 --> 20:12.460
Non avete capito niente.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.795
Andiamo.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.465
Vieni, vieni.

20:17.633 --> 20:20.843
Non tirare. Non tirare. Non tirare!

20:29.937 --> 20:32.146
Andiamo! Andiamo a casa.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.861
(both) Ciao.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.529
Disgraziato!

20:53.210 --> 20:54.502
(dog barks)

20:56.672 --> 20:58.589
Andiamo, andiamo, eh?

21:00.008 --> 21:00.967
Come va?

21:01.134 --> 21:03.511
Bene, bene. Upstairs.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.846
Everybody upstairs!

21:06.014 --> 21:08.349
Lo so. Va bene, va bene!

21:08.517 --> 21:11.018
Come on! Andiamo! Insieme.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.020
Tutti! Andiamo a casa.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.522
(Loretta) Ciao, bello.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.524
(grandfather) Ciao, cara. Ciao.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.795
- So, will you live here?
- No.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.046
Why not?

21:39.214 --> 21:41.048
Pop don't like Johnny.

21:42.676 --> 21:46.220
- We can sell the house.
- I got married before, you didn't sell.

21:46.388 --> 21:50.182
Grandma was still alive.
Ciro was still home, going to school.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.768
Now he's married, gone to Florida.

21:53.687 --> 21:56.022
If you and Johnny moved in
and had a baby...

21:56.189 --> 21:59.233
Ma, I'm 37 years old.

21:59.401 --> 22:03.529
What's 37?
I didn't have Ciro until after I was 37.

22:04.197 --> 22:06.157
It ain't over till it's over.

22:08.785 --> 22:11.704
Johnny's got a big apartment.
We'll move in there.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.748
So we'll sell the house.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.249
You know... What?

22:15.417 --> 22:19.253
I wanna live here, I love the house.
Pop don't like Johnny.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.213
No, we don't.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.508
(phone rings)

22:25.427 --> 22:26.427
I'll get it.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.803
OK.

22:30.223 --> 22:33.768
- Hello?
- Una chiamata per signorina Loretta...

22:33.935 --> 22:36.729
Yeah, yeah! This is Loretta Castorini.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.939
Si può parlare, signore.

22:39.107 --> 22:41.442
- Johnny!
- Johnny?

22:42.444 --> 22:43.402
Operator?

22:43.570 --> 22:46.364
- Op... Loretta?
- Yeah!

22:46.531 --> 22:50.868
Yes. Sh sh sh! It's me.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.454
I'm calling from the deathbed
of my mother.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.706
Yeah. How was your plane ride?

22:55.874 --> 22:59.210
The waitresses were very nice.

22:59.378 --> 23:03.214
- My mother is slipping away.
- How long do I have to wait?

23:03.632 --> 23:06.092
Quanto io devo aspettare?

23:06.259 --> 23:09.720
Stai calma, stai calma, mammita!

23:12.140 --> 23:13.224
I can't talk long.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.851
Did you tell her we're getting married?

23:16.019 --> 23:18.437
Oh, no, no. Not yet.

23:18.605 --> 23:21.482
I'm waiting... I'm waiting
till a moment when she's peaceful.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.692
Well, don't wait till she's dead.

23:23.860 --> 23:27.988
- Have you called my brother?
- No. I'm sorry, no, not yet. I forgot.

23:28.156 --> 23:31.075
- Will you do it today?
- Yes. Yes.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.078
Make sure he comes to the wedding.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.289
Five years is too long
for bad blood between brothers.

23:37.457 --> 23:40.709
Nothing can replace the family, Loretta.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.546
I can see that now...

23:45.215 --> 23:47.341
Loretta? Loretta, are you there?

23:47.509 --> 23:50.886
- Loretta!
- OK, I'm sorry. I'll do it today.

23:51.054 --> 23:53.097
And listen, Johnny, you know...

23:53.265 --> 23:55.099
...call me after you tell her, OK?

23:55.267 --> 23:56.976
All right, all right.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.561
And uh...

23:58.728 --> 24:01.939
Don't stand directly under the sun.
Use your hat.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.692
I got my hat, all right, all right.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.818
Bye.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.528
All right, bye-bye.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.614
What did I do with that card?

24:13.118 --> 24:14.243
How's the mother?

24:14.411 --> 24:17.204
She's dying.
But I could still hear her big mouth.

24:26.089 --> 24:28.007
(sobs)

24:37.017 --> 24:39.977
(Johnny wails)

24:40.145 --> 24:41.937
He didn't tell her!

24:42.105 --> 24:44.482
You know, the woman makes him crazy.

24:45.525 --> 24:48.527
Now who are you calling? Uffa!

24:48.695 --> 24:50.863
(phone rings)

24:52.532 --> 24:53.616
Cammareri's.

24:53.783 --> 24:56.827
Yeah, is Ronny Cammareri there, please?

24:56.995 --> 24:58.204
Hold on.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.456
Ronny! The phone!

25:01.374 --> 25:02.583
Ronny!

25:02.751 --> 25:04.168
Yeah, this is Ronny.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.713
Yeah. Um...
I'm calling for your brother.

25:07.881 --> 25:11.175
He's getting married
and would like it if you would come.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.052
Why didn't he call himself?

25:13.220 --> 25:16.388
- He's in Palermo.
- What's wrong can never be made right.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.432
Let me just come and talk...

25:18.600 --> 25:20.267
...talk to you!

25:20.435 --> 25:23.437
Animal! What an animal!

25:45.835 --> 25:47.670
Thanks, Mrs. Fugacci.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.171
There you go.

25:49.339 --> 25:52.132
- Bye, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

25:52.300 --> 25:55.594
- Is Ronny Cammareri here?
- He's down at the ovens.

25:55.762 --> 25:58.472
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to him.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.359
This way.

26:16.324 --> 26:17.866
- Ronny!
- What?

26:18.034 --> 26:21.412
- Somebody here to see Ronny.
- Ronny!

26:22.247 --> 26:24.498
Ronny! Somebody wants to see you!

26:44.561 --> 26:47.104
Have you come from my brother Johnny?

26:47.272 --> 26:48.272
Yeah.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.440
Why?

26:49.608 --> 26:52.359
Well, we're gonna get married.

26:55.905 --> 26:59.241
- You're gonna marry my brother Johnny.
- Yeah.

26:59.409 --> 27:02.870
- Shall we go someplace to talk?
- I have no life.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.747
Excuse me?

27:04.914 --> 27:06.206
I have no life.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.792
My brother Johnny took my life from me.

27:10.211 --> 27:11.879
I... I don't understand you.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.465
And now he's getting married.

27:15.508 --> 27:16.675
He has his!

27:17.844 --> 27:19.970
He's getting his.

27:20.138 --> 27:22.139
And he wants me to come.

27:23.516 --> 27:25.059
What is life?

27:25.769 --> 27:29.647
- I didn't come here to upset you.
- They say bread is life.

27:29.814 --> 27:33.567
And I bake bread... bread... bread!

27:33.735 --> 27:37.071
And I sweat...
and shovel this stinking dough...

27:37.238 --> 27:39.073
...in and out
of this hot hole in the wall...

27:39.240 --> 27:43.160
...and I should be so happy!

27:43.328 --> 27:44.578
Huh, sweetie?

27:44.746 --> 27:47.289
You want me to come
to the wedding of my brother?

27:50.543 --> 27:52.252
Where's my wedding?

27:53.463 --> 27:55.923
Chrissy! Over by the wall!

27:56.091 --> 27:57.299
Bring me the big knife.

27:57.467 --> 27:59.760
- No, Ronny!
- Bring me the big knife!

27:59.928 --> 28:01.512
I'm gonna cut my throat!

28:01.680 --> 28:04.098
Maybe I should come back another time.

28:04.265 --> 28:05.974
No, I want you to see this.

28:06.142 --> 28:09.353
You can watch me kill myself
so you can tell my brother Johnny...

28:09.521 --> 28:12.356
...on his wedding day. OK?

28:12.524 --> 28:14.316
Chrissy! Bring me the big knife!

28:14.484 --> 28:16.068
I tell ya, I won't do it!

28:16.236 --> 28:18.862
She won't do it.
Do you know about me?

28:19.030 --> 28:20.823
- Oh, Mr. Cammareri...
- What?!

28:23.451 --> 28:24.493
Do you know about me?

28:26.496 --> 28:27.830
OK.

28:27.997 --> 28:30.457
Nothing is anybody's fault.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.669
But... things happen.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.254
Look.

28:38.258 --> 28:41.135
This wood is fake.

28:41.302 --> 28:44.430
Five years ago,
I was engaged to be married. And uh...

28:44.597 --> 28:46.056
And Johnny came in here.

28:46.224 --> 28:49.393
And he ordered bread from me.
And I said, "OK, some bread."

28:49.561 --> 28:52.688
And I... I put my hand in the slicer...

28:52.856 --> 28:56.150
...and it got caught
cos I wasn't paying attention.

28:56.317 --> 28:59.153
The slicer chewed off my hand.

28:59.320 --> 29:02.865
And it's funny, cos when
my fiancée found out about it...

29:03.032 --> 29:05.325
When she found out
I had been maimed...

29:05.493 --> 29:06.994
...she left me for another man.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.622
That's the bad blood
between you and Johnny?

29:10.790 --> 29:12.416
Yes, that's it.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.835
Yeah, but that's not Johnny's fault.

29:17.213 --> 29:20.591
I don't care!
I ain't no freakin' monument to justice!

29:20.759 --> 29:22.676
I lost my hand!

30:37.210 --> 30:38.669

31:55.455 --> 31:57.164
$10,800.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.249
That seems like a lot.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.383

32:08.551 --> 32:11.678
There's the kind of pipe you have,
which is garbage.

32:11.846 --> 32:13.597
And you can see where that's gotten you.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.350
Then there's bronze...
which is very good.

32:16.517 --> 32:21.521
Unless something goes wrong.
And something always goes wrong.

32:21.689 --> 32:23.106
And then...

32:23.274 --> 32:26.360
...there's copper,
which is the only pipe I use.

32:26.527 --> 32:27.819
It costs money.

32:27.987 --> 32:31.949
It costs money because it saves money.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.826

I think we should follow
Mr. Castorini's advice, heart.

Hey, howl, come on!

47:25.008 --> 47:27.009
Guarda la luna!

47:52.202 --> 47:54.954
- Oh, my God!
- What?

47:55.122 --> 47:57.248
- What?!
- Take it easy.

47:57.416 --> 48:00.376
- This time I wanted to do it right.
- Don't become excited.

48:00.544 --> 48:04.088
I thought if I didn't go to the
City Hall, I wouldn't have bad luck.

48:04.256 --> 48:06.841
- You make me feel guilty.
- I'm marrying your brother!

48:07.009 --> 48:08.926
All right, I'm guilty. I confess.

48:09.094 --> 48:11.387
The wedding's in two weeks.
You're invited.

48:11.555 --> 48:14.473
How come you didn't
be with your mother in Palermo?

48:14.641 --> 48:16.058
She don't like me.

48:16.226 --> 48:18.644
You don't get along with anybody,
do you?

48:19.688 --> 48:22.648
- What did you do?
- What did I do?!

48:23.650 --> 48:25.985
- You ruined my life.
- That's impossible.

48:26.153 --> 48:29.155
It was ruined when I got here.
You ruined my life.

48:30.449 --> 48:33.034
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, yes, you did.

48:33.201 --> 48:34.243
Oh, yes, you did.

48:34.411 --> 48:38.706
You've got them bad eyes, like a gypsy.
Why didn't I see it yesterday?

48:38.874 --> 48:41.584
Bad luck, that's it.
Is that all I'm ever gonna have?

48:42.836 --> 48:45.379
I should have taken a rock
and killed myself years ago.

48:45.547 --> 48:47.048
I'm gonna marry him. Do you hear me?

48:47.215 --> 48:49.383
Last night never happened.
I'm gonna marry him.

48:49.551 --> 48:52.970
You and I are gonna take this
to our coffins.

48:53.138 --> 48:55.348
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

48:55.515 --> 48:57.892
I'm in love with you.

49:00.812 --> 49:03.356
- Snap out of it!
- I can't.

49:03.523 --> 49:05.191
Then I must never see you again...

49:05.359 --> 49:09.570
...and the bad blood will have to stay
between you and Johnny.

49:09.738 --> 49:11.864
- And you won't come to the wedding.
- I will.

49:12.032 --> 49:15.076
- I'm telling you, you can't!
- He wants me to come.

49:15.243 --> 49:17.119
That's because he don't know, OK?

49:17.287 --> 49:20.706
Now wait a minute, honey.
Listen, all right.

49:20.874 --> 49:23.209
I won't come to the wedding
provided one thing.

49:23.377 --> 49:26.295
- What?
- Come with me tonight to the opera.

49:26.463 --> 49:29.256
- What are you talking about?!
- I love two things.

49:29.424 --> 49:31.717
I love you and... and I love the opera.

49:31.885 --> 49:35.346
If I can have the two things I love
together for one night...

49:35.514 --> 49:37.723
...I would be satisfied to give up...

49:37.891 --> 49:40.643
Oh, Christ, to give up
the rest of my life.

49:40.811 --> 49:42.853
- All right, all right.
- All right.

49:43.021 --> 49:44.021
All right!

49:44.189 --> 49:46.023
- Meet me at the Met.
- All right, all right.

49:51.071 --> 49:53.823
- Where's the Met?
- Well, you gotta...

50:19.433 --> 50:20.891
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

50:21.059 --> 50:23.269
It's two months since
my last confession.

50:23.437 --> 50:25.771
What sins have you to confess?

50:25.939 --> 50:27.940
Twice I took the Lord's name in vain...

50:28.108 --> 50:29.942
...once I slept with
my fiancé's brother...

50:30.110 --> 50:33.946
...and I bounced a check
at the liquor store, but by mistake.

50:34.114 --> 50:35.656
Then it's not a sin.

50:35.824 --> 50:37.616
But...

50:38.660 --> 50:41.746
...what was that second thing you said,
Loretta?

50:41.913 --> 50:44.874
You mean the one about
I slept with my fiancé's brother?

50:45.042 --> 50:47.209
That's a pretty big sin.

50:47.377 --> 50:50.087
- I know.
- You should think about this.

50:50.255 --> 50:51.380
I know.

50:51.548 --> 50:52.798
All right.

50:52.966 --> 50:56.594
For your penance, say two rosaries.

50:57.804 --> 51:00.014
Be careful, Loretta.

51:00.182 --> 51:02.266
Reflect on your life.

51:02.434 --> 51:04.477
All right.

51:04.978 --> 51:08.689
Ego te absolvo, in nomine Patris,
Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

- I don't wanna talk about it.

Just like your father.

51:39.054 --> 51:40.971
I lied to him.

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:42.062
A multiplication table.

01:05:42.229 --> 01:05:44.272
Except sometimes...

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.358
Sometimes, I'll be droning along...

01:05:46.525 --> 01:05:51.071
...and I'll look up
and I'll see a fresh...

01:05:51.238 --> 01:05:53.490
...beautiful young face.

01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:55.200
And it's all new to her.

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:59.788
I'm just this great guy
who's brilliant and thinks out loud.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:03.249
When that happens, when I look out
there among those chairs...

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:06.586
...and see a young woman's face...

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:08.546
...and see me in her eyes...

01:06:08.714 --> 01:06:12.592
...me, the way I always wanted to be,
maybe once was...

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.928
...I ask her out for a date.

01:06:17.181 --> 01:06:19.349
It doesn't last long.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:21.351
A few weeks...

01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:23.311
...a couple of precious months.

01:06:25.564 --> 01:06:29.275
Then she catches on that I'm just
this burned-out old gasbag...

01:06:30.444 --> 01:06:32.696
...and she's as fresh and bright...

01:06:32.863 --> 01:06:36.408
...and full of promise
as moonlight in a martini.

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:42.247
(sighs)

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:46.876
And at that moment she stands up and
throws a glass of water in my face...

01:06:47.044 --> 01:06:50.213
...or some action to that effect.
(laughs)

01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:53.466
What you don't know
about women is a lot.

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:59.180
Well... that's not what I hear.

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:09.399
- Two white wines, please.
- Yes, sir.

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:21.119
(Ronny)
I'd like two glasses of champagne.

01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:28.168
Canadian Club with ginger ale
and Dubonnet on the rocks, please.

01:07:28.335 --> 01:07:31.254
- (Loretta) What's that?
- (Ronny) This was done by Marc Chagall.

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:33.506
As you can see, he was a great artist.

01:07:33.674 --> 01:07:36.968
- It's kinda gaudy.
- He was having some fun.

01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:39.637
They get some turnout for this stuff,
huh?

01:07:39.805 --> 01:07:41.973
It's the best thing there is.

01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:46.811
You know, I like parts of it,
but I just don't... really get it.

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:51.775
You haven't once said you like my dress.

01:07:51.942 --> 01:07:54.652
I like your dress.

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.655
It's very bright. Oh...

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:09.667
Will you hold this? Thanks.

01:08:10.669 --> 01:08:12.170
May I walk with you a ways?

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:14.672
Sure. Thanks.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.719
- Do you live far from here?
- Just up there.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.558

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.393

Ah, che bella luna.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:39.781
Andiamo vedere la luna.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:52.335

I couldn't believe it.
I didn't think she would die.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.705

- She had TB.

- Who's that? You're engaged.
- You're married.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:10.700
You're my daughter.
Don't act like a puttana.

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:13.286
- And you're my father...
- All right.

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:16.080
I didn't see you here.

My God! It's a mansion.

01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:45.151
It's a house.

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:47.612
I live in a one-bedroom apartment.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:50.907
What exactly does your husband do?

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:52.325
He's a plumber.

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:54.952
Well, that explains it, then.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.708
(sighs) Temperature's dropping.

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:04.295
- I guess you can't invite me in.
- No.

01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:05.463
People home.

01:13:06.298 --> 01:13:08.132
No. I think the house is empty.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.469
I can't invite you in
because I'm married.

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:13.554
Because I know who I am.

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:19.227
- You're shivering.
- I'm a little cold.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:23.064
You're a little boy.
And you like to be bad.

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:27.485
We could go to my apartment.
See how the other half lives.

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:29.487
I'm too old for you.

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:33.032
I'm too old for me.
That's my predicament.

Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?

01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:43.960
Sure.

01:13:51.802 --> 01:13:53.219
I'm freezing.

01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:57.640
Goodnight.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:40.725

- No.

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:45.980
- I think that's it, Al.
- (man) See you, Al!

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:56.699
- What do you wanna do now?
- I wanna go home.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:05.708
- Goodnight, Al.
- Take it easy, Ronny.

01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:11.255
God, it's cold.

01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:13.925
It smells like snow.

01:15:14.092 --> 01:15:17.220
You know, my mother guessed
my father was seeing somebody.

01:15:17.387 --> 01:15:20.681
That Mona, I mean,
she's some piece of cheap goods.

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:22.934
Who am I to talk?

01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:26.938
- What's the matter?
- How can you ask me that?

01:15:27.105 --> 01:15:29.857
- You're making me feel guilty.
- You are guilty! I'm guilty.

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:33.194
Of what?
Only God can point the finger, Loretta.

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:37.198
- Yeah, well, I know what I know.
- And what do you know?

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:41.118
OK, you tell me my life.
I'll tell you yours.

01:15:41.286 --> 01:15:46.040
I'm a wolf. You run to the wolf in me.
That don't make you no lamb.

01:15:46.833 --> 01:15:48.334
You're gonna marry my brother.

01:15:50.128 --> 01:15:52.838
Why do you wanna sell your life short?

01:15:53.006 --> 01:15:58.094
Playing it safe's the most dangerous
thing a woman like you could do.

01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:00.972
I mean, you waited for
the right man the first time.

01:16:02.015 --> 01:16:05.059
- Why didn't you wait for him again?
- Because he didn't come.

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:07.186
- I'm here.
- You're late.

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:16.153
This is your place.
So this is where we were going.

01:16:16.321 --> 01:16:17.697
Yeah.

01:16:17.864 --> 01:16:19.657
You know, we had a deal.

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:21.993
You said if I came with you
to the opera...

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.371
...you'd leave me alone for ever.
And I came with you!

01:16:26.456 --> 01:16:30.418
I'm gonna marry your brother and you're
gonna leave me alone for ever, right?

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.130
A person can see
where they've messed up in their life.

01:16:34.298 --> 01:16:38.593
They can change the way they do things.
They can even change their luck.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.638
So maybe my nature does draw me
to you. But I don't have to go with it.

01:16:42.806 --> 01:16:47.351
I can take hold of myself
and I can say yes to some things...

01:16:47.519 --> 01:16:50.563
...and no to other things
that will ruin everything.

01:16:51.648 --> 01:16:54.275
Otherwise, you know, what...

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:58.154
What good is this stupid life
that God gave us? I mean, for what?

01:16:58.322 --> 01:17:01.324
Are you listening to me?!

01:17:01.491 --> 01:17:02.867
Yeah.

01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:08.581
Everything seems like nothing to me now.
I want you in my bed.

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:11.542
I don't care if I burn in hell.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:14.295
I don't care if you burn in hell.

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.589
The past and the future is...

01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:17.757
...a joke to me now.

01:17:17.924 --> 01:17:21.886
I see that they're nothing,
I see they ain't here.

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:24.305

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:27.183
...is you... and me.

01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:28.976

- No.

01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:30.353
- I'm gonna go home.
- No!

- Come upstairs.

I don't care why you come.

01:17:35.692 --> 01:17:37.735
No, that's not what I mean.

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:42.198

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:45.117
Not... not like they told you love is.

01:17:45.285 --> 01:17:49.205
I didn't know this either.
But love don't make things nice.

01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:53.125
It ruins everything.
It breaks your heart.

01:17:53.293 --> 01:17:58.005
It makes things a mess.
We aren't here to make things perfect.

Not us. Not us!

We are here to ruin ourselves...

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:15.064
...and... and to break our hearts...

01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:17.983
...and love the wrong people.

01:18:18.151 --> 01:18:19.694
And die!

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:23.114
I mean that the storybooks are bullshit!

01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:26.200
Now I want you
to come upstairs with me...

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:50.321
A miracle? Well, that's news.

01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:53.574
My mother's recovered.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.077
- You're kidding?
- Oh, no.

01:21:57.245 --> 01:22:01.665
The breath had almost totally left
her body. She was as white as snow.

01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:03.167
And then...

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:06.253
...she completely
pulled back from death...

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:10.549
...and stood up...
and put on her clothes...

01:22:10.717 --> 01:22:13.802
...and began to cook
for everyone in the house.

01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:17.056
The mourners, and me, and herself.

01:22:17.223 --> 01:22:19.850
She ate a meal that could choke a pig.

01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:22.186
- That's incredible.
- Yes.

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:24.104
- (door opens)
- (dogs bark)

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:29.234
Hi, Pop.

01:22:29.402 --> 01:22:31.445
(mutters)

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:34.782
Oh, my God.

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:38.035
Is he all right?

01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:42.498
My father-in-law's got
this wrong idea in his head.

01:22:44.417 --> 01:22:46.460
Listen, Johnny.

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:48.545
There's a question I want to ask.

01:22:48.713 --> 01:22:51.966
I want you to tell me the truth...
if you can.

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:56.387
Why do men chase women?

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.391
Well uh...

01:23:02.268 --> 01:23:04.895
There's the Bible story.

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:07.481
God.

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:11.193
God took a rib from Adam...
and made Eve.

01:23:12.529 --> 01:23:15.322
Now, maybe men chase women
to get the rib back.

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:18.367
When God took the rib...

01:23:18.535 --> 01:23:20.911
...he left a big hole there.

01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:23.497
A place where
there used to be something.

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:26.500
And the women have that.

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:27.751
Now maybe...

01:23:27.919 --> 01:23:32.715
...just maybe
a man isn't complete as a man...

01:23:32.882 --> 01:23:35.009
...without a woman.

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:41.724
Why would a man need
more than one woman?

01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:43.600
I don't know.

01:23:45.353 --> 01:23:47.062
Maybe because he fears death.

01:23:48.481 --> 01:23:51.108
That's it. That's the reason.

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:53.068
- I don't know!
- No!

01:23:53.236 --> 01:23:56.697
That's it. No. Thank you.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:24:00.284
Thank you for answering my question.

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:01.744
(door slams)

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:05.706
Hi.

01:24:07.083 --> 01:24:09.043
Hello, Mr. Castorini.

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:13.213
Oh. Hi.

01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:14.798
Where you been?

01:24:14.966 --> 01:24:18.093
I don't know where I've been
and I don't know where I'm going.

01:24:18.261 --> 01:24:19.803
All right?

01:24:21.931 --> 01:24:23.724
You'll have your eyes opened for you,
my friend.

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.518
- I have my eyes open.
- Oh, yeah?

01:24:26.686 --> 01:24:29.730
Well, stick around.
Don't go on any long trips.

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:34.777
- I don't know what you mean.
- That's the point. I'll say no more.

01:24:34.944 --> 01:24:36.779
You haven't said anything.

01:24:36.946 --> 01:24:38.947
And that's all I'm saying.

01:24:39.115 --> 01:24:40.866
- Cosmo.
- What?

01:24:41.034 --> 01:24:43.577
I just want you to know,
no matter what you do...

01:24:43.745 --> 01:24:46.497
...you're gonna die,
just like everybody else.

01:24:47.999 --> 01:24:49.166
Thank you, Rose.

01:24:50.001 --> 01:24:51.418
You're welcome.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.338
I'm going to bed now.

01:24:57.675 --> 01:24:58.801
I'm going.

01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:00.677
Good.

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:05.140
He doesn't like you.
But thank you for answering my question.

01:25:05.308 --> 01:25:07.851
- You don't know where Loretta is?
- No. No idea.

01:25:08.019 --> 01:25:11.897
Mrs. Castorini, will you tell Loretta
that I'll come by in the morning?

01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:15.317
- We... We need to talk.
- OK, I'll tell her. OK.

01:25:15.485 --> 01:25:16.693
Thank you.

01:25:20.198 --> 01:25:23.909
- (chuckles)
- Watch it! The house!

I really don't know where to start.

01:27:08.598 --> 01:27:10.515

- No. Are you drunk?

01:27:10.683 --> 01:27:12.768
No. But I have a hangover.

01:27:12.936 --> 01:27:15.729
- Where's Pop?
- Upstairs.

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:19.274
Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.

01:27:19.442 --> 01:27:22.194
What?! He's in Sicily.

01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:25.822
- No more, he's not.
- He's there with his dying mother.

01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:27.282
- She recovered.
- She was dying!

01:27:27.450 --> 01:27:29.284
It was a miracle.

01:27:29.452 --> 01:27:32.371
This is modern times!
There ain't supposed to be miracles.

01:27:32.538 --> 01:27:35.207
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily.

01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:39.378
He came right from the airport.
He wanted to talk to you.

01:27:39.545 --> 01:27:44.007
You got a lovebite on your neck.
He's coming back this morning.

01:27:44.175 --> 01:27:46.426
Your life's going down the toilet.

01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:49.221
Cover up that damn thing!
Put some make-up on it!

01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:52.849
All right! Ma, OK, fine!
But you gotta help me.

01:27:53.017 --> 01:27:54.059
- Hurry up...
- (doorbell)

01:27:58.398 --> 01:27:59.898
You get it.

01:28:00.066 --> 01:28:01.942
(Loretta) Answer the door!

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:03.944
Mother?

01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:14.079
Hi. Is Loretta home?

01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:15.831
Come on in.

01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:17.749
(groans)

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.883
It's not Johnny.

01:28:27.719 --> 01:28:29.177
Ronny!

01:28:29.345 --> 01:28:30.846
Is Johnny here?

01:28:31.014 --> 01:28:32.973
- No, but he's coming.
- (Ronny) Good.

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:35.100
We can get this out on the table.

01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:38.145
Hi. I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:40.522
I'm Rose Castorini.

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:43.775
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

01:28:43.943 --> 01:28:46.111
You got a lovebite on your neck.

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:50.490
- Your mother's recovered from death.
- Oh, good.

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:52.659
- We're not close. I'm not...
- Ouch!

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:55.579
- You gotta leave.
- I want to meet the family.

01:28:55.747 --> 01:28:57.331
No. Really, you gotta get out of here.

01:28:57.498 --> 01:28:59.666
- Anyone want some oatmeal?
- No, Ma.

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:02.002
Yes, Mrs. Castorini. I would love some.

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:04.379
No, we don't want any oatmeal.

01:29:04.547 --> 01:29:05.714
Ma!

01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:07.716
That was a... This is a... Oh!

01:29:09.093 --> 01:29:11.136
- Thanks, Ma.
- You're welcome.

01:29:11.304 --> 01:29:14.014
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:17.934
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:22.606
It's very good to meet you,
Mr. Castorini.

01:29:24.817 --> 01:29:28.028
I have a feeling
this is going to be just delicious.

01:29:29.989 --> 01:29:33.116
- You're Johnny's brother?
- Yeah.

01:29:39.415 --> 01:29:40.791
Don't look at me like that, OK?

01:29:40.958 --> 01:29:41.917
(coughing)

01:29:42.085 --> 01:29:43.335
Hi, Pop.

01:29:46.839 --> 01:29:48.465
Buongiorno.

01:29:53.679 --> 01:29:57.265
- What's the matter, Pop?
- I'm old.

01:29:57.433 --> 01:29:59.601
The old are not wanted.

01:29:59.769 --> 01:30:02.854
And if they say it, they have no weight.

01:30:03.022 --> 01:30:06.525
But, my son... I must speak.

01:30:06.692 --> 01:30:11.154
You must pay for the wedding
of your only daughter.

01:30:11.322 --> 01:30:15.283
You break your house through pride.

01:30:15.451 --> 01:30:16.993
There.

01:30:17.161 --> 01:30:20.497
- I... I've said it.
- It's OK, Pop.

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:24.334
If she gets married...
I'll pay for the whole thing.

01:30:25.545 --> 01:30:26.837
Bravo. Bravo.

01:30:27.004 --> 01:30:29.506
Adesso, parla giusto. Bravo.

01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:32.050
Now you're talking. Bravo.

01:30:32.218 --> 01:30:35.512
Parlato bene. Ha fatto bene. Bravo.

01:30:36.556 --> 01:30:38.056
Let's eat.

01:30:46.065 --> 01:30:47.566
Have I been a good wife?

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:51.069
Yeah.

01:30:53.739 --> 01:30:56.408
I want you to stop seeing her.

01:31:23.769 --> 01:31:25.187
OK.

01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:32.736
And go to confession.

01:31:35.698 --> 01:31:40.202
A man understands one day
that his life is built on nothing...

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:43.788
...and that's a bad, crazy day.

01:31:48.044 --> 01:31:51.713
Your life is not built on nothing.

01:31:55.259 --> 01:31:56.593
Ti amo.

01:32:00.056 --> 01:32:02.516
Anch'io ti amo.

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:24.120
(doorbell)

01:32:24.288 --> 01:32:25.956
- It's Johnny, I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

01:32:26.123 --> 01:32:28.833
- (Ronny) I should tell him.
- (Loretta) I will.

01:32:29.001 --> 01:32:30.210
What am I gonna tell him?

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:34.673
Tell him the truth, Loretta.
They find out anyway.

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.883
You're right, Papa.

01:32:37.802 --> 01:32:40.637
Ti amo, mio piccolo angelo.

01:32:42.139 --> 01:32:44.558
- (woman) Hi, Loretta.
- Hi.

01:32:46.686 --> 01:32:48.395
- Hi, Loretta.
- Hi.

01:32:49.188 --> 01:32:51.022
Why aren't you two at the store?

01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:53.984
Do you have something
you wanna tell us, honey?

01:32:55.486 --> 01:32:56.653
No.

01:32:58.489 --> 01:33:00.740
We just come from the bank.

01:33:01.158 --> 01:33:02.909
Yeah.

01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:06.413
Oh, my God!
I forgot to make the deposit!

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:07.581
(Rita) Oh, she's got it.

01:33:07.748 --> 01:33:11.334
- I knew she had it!
- We didn't know what to think.

01:33:11.502 --> 01:33:13.545
You were so weird yesterday.

01:33:13.713 --> 01:33:17.132
And then we went to the bank
this morning, and no bag.

01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:19.009
We never suspected you.

01:33:19.176 --> 01:33:21.011
Listen, would anyone like some coffee?

01:33:21.178 --> 01:33:23.263
That's a good idea.

01:33:24.473 --> 01:33:27.142
- What's with this suspected?
- I'll tell you later.

01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:28.852
I forgot to make the deposit.

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:31.062
Sit down. Have some coffee.

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:47.787
- So what are we doing?
- Waiting. For Johnny Cammareri.

01:33:50.207 --> 01:33:52.042
My name's Ronny.

01:33:52.209 --> 01:33:54.085
Johnny's brother.

01:33:55.379 --> 01:33:58.173
Oh. Nice to meet you.
I'm Rita Cappomaggi.

01:33:58.341 --> 01:34:02.010
- Raymond Cappomaggi. Rose's brother.
- Hi.

01:34:15.232 --> 01:34:17.692
Someone tell a joke.

01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:19.736
(Ronny laughs)

01:34:20.738 --> 01:34:22.322
(doorbell)

01:34:25.576 --> 01:34:26.910
I'll get it.

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:36.878
I thought Johnny was in Palermo.

01:34:42.009 --> 01:34:44.010
It's Johnny Cammareri!

01:34:48.808 --> 01:34:50.100
Loretta?

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:55.271
Ronny!

01:34:58.150 --> 01:35:01.194
- Have you come to make peace with me?
- Yes.

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:03.071
But...

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:06.324
...you may not want to.

01:35:06.492 --> 01:35:08.159
Ronny, of course I want to.

01:35:08.327 --> 01:35:11.037
Johnny, your mother was dying.
How did she recover?

01:35:11.205 --> 01:35:14.749
I told her we were to be married
and she got well right away!

01:35:14.917 --> 01:35:16.918
- I'm sure she did!
- It was a miracle.

01:35:17.086 --> 01:35:18.837
(all murmur in agreement)

01:35:19.004 --> 01:35:21.297
Johnny, I have something
I have to tell you.

01:35:21.465 --> 01:35:24.843
And I have something to tell you.
But I must talk to you alone.

01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:27.846
No, I need my family around me now.

01:35:30.433 --> 01:35:32.100
Loretta...

01:35:33.352 --> 01:35:34.728
...I can't marry you.

01:35:34.895 --> 01:35:35.854
What?!

01:35:36.021 --> 01:35:39.941
- If I marry you, my mother will die!
- What do you mean? We're engaged!

01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:41.484
Loretta, what are you talking about?

01:35:41.652 --> 01:35:43.820
I'm talking about a promise!
He proposed!

01:35:43.988 --> 01:35:46.156
My mother was dying
and now she's not!

01:35:46.323 --> 01:35:49.576
You're 42 years old.
She's still running your life.

01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:51.661
And you don't love your mother!

01:35:51.829 --> 01:35:54.789
You are a big liar.
Because I have a ring right here.

01:35:54.957 --> 01:35:56.249
Oh, I must ask for that back.

01:35:56.417 --> 01:36:01.504
- All right. The engagement is off!
- You will see this is the best thing.

01:36:01.672 --> 01:36:04.340
And you'll drop dead
and I'll mourn you in a red dress!

01:36:04.508 --> 01:36:06.134
- Loretta...
- What?

01:36:07.636 --> 01:36:09.721
- Will you marry me?
- What?!

01:36:09.889 --> 01:36:11.890
Where's the ring?

01:36:13.642 --> 01:36:14.976
Johnny.

01:36:15.978 --> 01:36:18.104
Can I borrow that ring?

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:24.819
Thanks.

01:36:32.369 --> 01:36:35.663
Loretta Castorini...

01:36:35.831 --> 01:36:37.207
...will you marry me?

01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:42.796
Yes, Ronny. In front of all
these people, I'll marry you.

01:36:42.963 --> 01:36:45.298
- (Rose) Do you love him, Loretta?
- Ma, I love him awful.

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:48.092
Oh, God. That's too bad.

01:36:49.345 --> 01:36:51.095
She loves me.

01:36:58.145 --> 01:36:59.938
What's the matter, Pop?

01:37:00.105 --> 01:37:02.148
I'm confused.

01:37:02.608 --> 01:37:03.733
(cork pops)

01:37:03.901 --> 01:37:06.736
(excited chattering)

01:37:11.742 --> 01:37:13.535
To Loretta and Ronny!

01:37:18.207 --> 01:37:20.124
There we are! Thank you, thank you.

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:25.046
(Cosmo) Come on, Raymond!

01:37:26.632 --> 01:37:27.590
Bevi.

01:37:27.758 --> 01:37:30.343
Come, come.
Your brother is here and...

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:31.845
No, I don't want any.

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:35.431
You are a part of the family.
Don't you realize? Come on, bevi!

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:44.065
Everybody, come on! Glass in hand!

01:37:45.442 --> 01:37:47.610
Alla famiglia!

01:37:48.779 --> 01:37:50.655
To... to family!

01:37:50.823 --> 01:37:52.574
(all) To family!

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:56.619
(♪ Finale to La Bohème, Act 3)

01:38:45.169 --> 01:38:47.795
Alla famiglia! Salute!
