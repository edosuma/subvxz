WEBVTT

00:00.870 --> 00:03.510
Previously on the 4400...

00:04.360 --> 00:05.880
we're not sure what's just happened.

00:05.939 --> 00:09.290
The light is gone, and thousands of people
have just suddenly appeared.

00:09.330 --> 00:11.630
- We're letting them go.
- We're letting them go?

00:11.690 --> 00:13.410
You don't have a legal rightto hold them.

00:13.440 --> 00:14.300
You're pregnant?

00:14.390 --> 00:16.860
I wasn't pregnant when i was abducted,

00:16.910 --> 00:18.670
but i was when i got back.

00:18.760 --> 00:19.680
What's all this?

00:19.730 --> 00:21.060
What's it look like?

00:21.130 --> 00:22.770
That baby could be the key to the future,

00:22.820 --> 00:25.510
and it has to be protected, and i can do that.

00:29.370 --> 00:31.270
Go ahead. Run!

00:32.600 --> 00:34.300
That baby belongs with me.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.220
This is your new house?

00:36.300 --> 00:37.290
It's yours too.

00:37.380 --> 00:39.710
I've been looking forward to this moment for too long.

00:39.770 --> 00:40.470
Diana skouris,

00:40.550 --> 00:45.940
your adoption of maia rutledge
is hereby complete, legal, and binding.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.760
Her visions stoppedabout four months ago.

00:47.820 --> 00:49.010
We're not sure why.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.460
Mrs. Usher next door is getting a kitten.

00:51.500 --> 00:55.100
Mommy's bosses will be punished for betraying us.

00:55.170 --> 00:56.580
It wasn't me!

00:56.620 --> 00:59.920
That creature made me pull the trigger!

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074

01:18.570 --> 01:20.420
Getting dressed from the top down now?

01:20.460 --> 01:22.010
That the way they do it on the mariners?

01:22.050 --> 01:23.290
Mariners?

01:23.360 --> 01:24.830
Gary's got his eyes on the sox.

01:24.900 --> 01:27.280
No, you mean the sox got their eyes on him.

01:27.570 --> 01:30.330
How's it feel, all those scouts in the stands?

01:30.360 --> 01:32.570
You bend over to tie a shoelace, they make a note.

01:32.610 --> 01:34.690
How about a little respect, huh?

01:34.750 --> 01:37.440
You're in the presence of the new jackie robinson.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.220
First 4400 to make the big leagues.

01:40.610 --> 01:42.400
Don't worry about the scouts, man.

01:42.470 --> 01:43.710
I'll float you some right down the middle.

01:43.770 --> 01:47.050
You just get into your rhythm,
forget they're even out there, all right?

01:47.970 --> 01:49.130
Can't blame him.

01:49.180 --> 01:50.730
Six scouts.

01:50.790 --> 01:53.030
I'd be afraidi was going to choke.

01:53.070 --> 01:55.370
I'm not gonna choke.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.800
Barnes can't serve them any better than that.

02:35.860 --> 02:38.840
Just... just give me a second.

02:41.970 --> 02:43.680
He's throwing him a beach ball.

02:43.740 --> 02:45.770
He's scared, man.

02:46.850 --> 02:48.340
What was wrong with that?

02:48.400 --> 02:49.800
What a loser.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.400
Follow through. Follow through.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.310
This time try taking the bat off your shoulder.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.330
Why don't you try kissing my ass?

03:03.830 --> 03:04.860
What's your problem, gary?

03:04.930 --> 03:07.290
Navarro! Get your head in the game. Focus.

03:07.340 --> 03:08.850
I want to see some contact.

03:08.910 --> 03:09.710
The majors?

03:09.780 --> 03:12.320
Kid doesn't look like he's
ready for rookie ball.

03:12.380 --> 03:14.170
Just shut up!

03:14.230 --> 03:17.240
Will all of you just shut
the hell up and let me concentrate?

03:17.300 --> 03:18.580
Whoa, gary...

03:18.640 --> 03:20.330
take it down a notch.

03:20.390 --> 03:21.460
Yeah, you're a flake, aren't you?

03:21.510 --> 03:22.540
Go ahead. Take a swing at me.

03:22.590 --> 03:24.420
I'll plant you where you stand.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.930
I am not going to hit you!

03:25.970 --> 03:26.980
Who said anything about hitting, man?

03:27.010 --> 03:28.730
That's it, navarro. You're done for the day.

03:28.780 --> 03:31.020
I want to see you in my office after practice.

03:31.070 --> 03:33.860
There's nothing wrong with me.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.200
There is nothing wrong with me.

03:36.260 --> 03:38.860
- Keep walking, mister.
- There is nothing wrong with me!

03:38.900 --> 03:41.490
Keep walking, mister. Now.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.930
Gary, man, take it easy.

03:44.980 --> 03:47.210
Don't touch me!

03:49.270 --> 03:51.080
<i>This kid isn't ready, man.</i>

03:51.140 --> 03:53.310
<i>This was a big waste of time.</i>

03:54.610 --> 03:56.760
<i>Ready for the bigs, my ass.</i>

03:56.810 --> 03:58.220
<i>What was wrong with that?</i>

03:58.280 --> 03:59.790
You shut up.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.440
Shut up!

04:01.520 --> 04:02.600
Shut up!

04:02.670 --> 04:03.990
You shut up!

04:04.050 --> 04:05.110
You shut up!

04:05.160 --> 04:06.490
Shut up!

04:06.640 --> 04:08.790
There's nothing wrong with me!

04:08.840 --> 04:11.150
There's nothing wrong with me!

04:21.200 --> 04:26.400
* So long ago, another life *

04:26.500 --> 04:30.100
* I can feel your heart beat *

04:30.600 --> 04:35.700
* it's not a dream, remember us *

04:35.800 --> 04:39.900
* I can see it in your eyes *

04:40.000 --> 04:43.400
* we'll find our place in time *

04:43.500 --> 04:48.100
* our place in time beyond the sun *

04:49.300 --> 04:52.600
* we'll find our place in time *

04:52.700 --> 04:58.000
* our place in time to call our own *

05:59.130 --> 06:02.110
Well, it beats that ditch in the woods.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.980
Not by much.

06:10.050 --> 06:12.240
It's just a day or two.

06:12.710 --> 06:15.250
Let isabelle get rested up,

06:15.300 --> 06:17.210
then we'll push on the rest of the way.

06:17.260 --> 06:18.810
We got enough to make it to white bird?

06:18.880 --> 06:20.600
New car...

06:21.090 --> 06:22.760
trip to the emergency room...

06:22.810 --> 06:23.790
it's going to be close.

06:23.840 --> 06:24.980
All this running and hiding,

06:25.020 --> 06:28.320
sometimes i forget we haven't done anything wrong.

06:28.380 --> 06:31.590
Three dead men in the woods might disagree.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.660
Do you want to shower first, or should i?

06:34.720 --> 06:36.170
You go ahead.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.890
Give isabelle her bottle, okay?

06:46.040 --> 06:48.240
That was you, wasn't it?

06:49.570 --> 06:52.720
Who stopped those men in the woods?

06:55.030 --> 06:57.650
Daddy sure would like to know.

06:59.030 --> 07:02.800
But you're not going to tell me, are you?

07:06.400 --> 07:07.420
What's funny?

07:07.480 --> 07:08.680
Marmaduke.

07:09.140 --> 07:10.590
Can we get a dog?

07:10.670 --> 07:13.850
Oh, smooth, how you slid that in there.

07:14.030 --> 07:15.460
No.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.830
Skouris.

07:26.370 --> 07:29.280
April.

07:30.060 --> 07:31.010
No, no, no, no.

07:31.060 --> 07:33.940
I'm glad to hear from you. You're my sister.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.040
It's just... it's been a while, that's all.

07:37.140 --> 07:39.880
No, we're here, just having breakfast.

07:40.430 --> 07:41.690
Hang on a sec.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.360
Mrs. Lennox must've forgotten her key.

07:43.410 --> 07:43.920
I'll get it.

07:43.980 --> 07:47.040
No, no. No, i'll get it. You just keep eating.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.960
I just have to let maia's teacher in.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.050
Coming!

07:50.110 --> 07:51.510
One more sec.

07:54.620 --> 07:55.870
Surprised?

07:55.930 --> 07:57.050
April...

07:57.130 --> 07:58.950
how's it going, sibling?

07:59.030 --> 07:59.880
Good.

07:59.950 --> 08:00.720
You look good.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.190
Yeah, you too.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.430
Thanks.

08:04.570 --> 08:06.670
What are you doing here?

08:06.740 --> 08:09.070
The pacific northwest body art expo.

08:09.130 --> 08:10.600
I have a booth.

08:10.650 --> 08:12.530
Don't tell me you haven't gotten your tickets yet.

08:12.590 --> 08:14.320
Uh, no.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.810
Hello.

08:17.450 --> 08:18.440
Oh, my god.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.900
You must be maia.

08:20.990 --> 08:24.360
April skouris, black sheep of the family.

08:24.610 --> 08:26.180
Di, you are so lucky.

08:26.230 --> 08:28.760
Look at this fabulous kid you got.

08:28.820 --> 08:31.970
And no labor, no stretch marks, no diapers...

08:32.070 --> 08:34.200
no crappy husband.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.070
Oh, wait, that was me.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.190
How come i never met you before?

08:38.260 --> 08:39.900
- It's complicated. - we've been busy.

08:39.950 --> 08:42.110
Okay, we'll stick with "busy."

08:42.159 --> 08:43.130
Whatever.

08:43.179 --> 08:44.990
I'm here now.

08:45.340 --> 08:48.190
So where are you staying while you're in town?

08:48.640 --> 08:51.150
This couch looks comfortable.

08:59.620 --> 09:01.580
It's not an execution, shawn.

09:01.640 --> 09:05.090
Last time i was on stage
was my fourth-grade spelling bee.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.980
These people are interested in us.

09:07.020 --> 09:09.170
They want to hear what we have to say.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.740
You'll think of something.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.190
Hello.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.520
My name is shawn farrell,

09:24.570 --> 09:27.810
and i am one of the 4400.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.820
Uh, a few months ago,

09:34.870 --> 09:38.020
i never thought anyone would ever 
clap when i said that.

09:38.930 --> 09:41.020
But we didn't know then what we know now...

09:41.080 --> 09:43.760
the future of mankind is in jeopardy,

09:43.800 --> 09:47.250
and right here, with your help,

09:47.300 --> 09:50.140
is where we start to set things straight.

09:50.180 --> 09:50.950
If you join us here...

09:51.020 --> 09:53.620
mr. Collier, mr. Dravitt's here for you.

09:53.655 --> 09:54.075
Thank you.

09:54.110 --> 09:56.380
...the best versión of yourselves.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.330
Ian.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.590
Thanks for fitting me in.

10:04.650 --> 10:06.520
Interesting place you got here.

10:06.570 --> 10:08.790
I'm not going to be abducted by aliens, am i?

10:08.840 --> 10:11.310
No, ian. They weren't aliens.

10:11.390 --> 10:12.210
They were from the... future

10:12.270 --> 10:14.150
i know. So you've told me, ad nauseum.

10:14.210 --> 10:17.270
Look, it's all the same sideshow to me.

10:17.340 --> 10:19.840
So, here i am.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.730
Here you are.

10:22.150 --> 10:25.130
What say we get down to business?

10:27.630 --> 10:28.780
Ian Dravitt.

10:28.830 --> 10:31.430
Founder and ceo of executive projections,

10:31.490 --> 10:33.770
a multinational corporation based in zimbabwe.

10:33.830 --> 10:36.320
Your company wants to do
business in a third worid country,

10:36.360 --> 10:37.800
they'll show you the lay of the land.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.450
It's all perfectly legitimate...

10:39.500 --> 10:40.520
yeah, on the surface,

10:40.570 --> 10:43.370
but dravitt's real money comes
from mercenary activity and arms dealing.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.320
Sold grenade launchers to the i.r.a.,

10:45.380 --> 10:48.610
white phosphorus landmines to
the shining path guerrillas in peru...

10:48.640 --> 10:49.850
so what's he selling to collier?

10:49.900 --> 10:50.540
Good question,

10:50.590 --> 10:53.640
but our observation teams can't even
tell you what time collier takes lunch.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.760
Beyond the lobby, that place is a mystery.

10:55.820 --> 10:58.950
I mean, we've sent our agents
in disguised as air conditioning guys,

10:59.000 --> 11:00.290
fiber optics repairmen...

11:00.350 --> 11:02.730
yeah, we get a bug in,
it's yanked before the day is over.

11:02.780 --> 11:05.440
Probably sweeping the place every few hours.

11:05.500 --> 11:08.820
As far as collier's pow-wows with dravitt...

11:08.930 --> 11:10.450
all we can do is guess.

11:10.510 --> 11:11.970
You think he's stockpiling weapons?

11:12.030 --> 11:13.570
Oh, arms, anthrax...

11:13.620 --> 11:15.140
nothing would surprise me.

11:15.190 --> 11:17.810
I mean, collier's all but said
he's at war with the u.s. Government.

11:17.860 --> 11:20.510
Could be laying down
a defense perimeter around the center.

11:20.570 --> 11:22.720
That way, if we ever have to go in there, he'll be ready.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.820
Think waco.

11:24.890 --> 11:26.820
Jonestown.

11:29.370 --> 11:30.660
Jarvis.

11:30.730 --> 11:32.050
I'll send them down.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.080
Mr. Navarro?

11:40.150 --> 11:41.700
I'm agent skouris. This is agent...

11:41.800 --> 11:44.800
please... please, don't talk.

11:44.860 --> 11:46.080
It's too noisy.

11:46.130 --> 11:49.000
Your voices and your thoughts, 
they just all bleed together.

11:49.070 --> 11:50.880
The e.r. Report said you were going on about...

11:50.920 --> 11:52.120
no voices.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.220
Just concentrate on what you want to ask me,

11:55.290 --> 11:57.460
and i'll hear you.

12:02.010 --> 12:04.020
A couple of weeks ago.

12:07.130 --> 12:09.160
It was during a game.

12:09.450 --> 12:12.090
I could hear everyone's thoughts.

12:12.190 --> 12:16.980
At first, it was just the pitcher, 
which was pretty good, actually...

12:17.080 --> 12:21.060
because i knew everything he was 
going to throw before he threw it.

12:21.350 --> 12:24.140
Went five for five.

12:27.430 --> 12:29.580
Two homers, two singles, and a double.

12:29.650 --> 12:31.590
That is exactly what...

12:36.530 --> 12:39.200
yeah, it was great when it started,

12:39.280 --> 12:40.940
but i can't control it.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.960
First, it was everyone on the team,

12:43.020 --> 12:44.540
and then everyone in the stands,

12:44.600 --> 12:46.220
and then, i don't know, it was just...

12:46.280 --> 12:47.440
just everyone.

12:47.500 --> 12:51.970
It's like this ocean of noise crashing around in my head.

12:53.460 --> 12:57.090
I want someone to make it go away.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.820
That's what i want.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.850
I was this close...

13:02.180 --> 13:05.840
to making it to the majors when i got snatched.

13:09.270 --> 13:12.490
This time, i'm gonna make it.

13:12.950 --> 13:15.580
I have to make it.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.770
What, so navarro is really some kind of mind reader?

13:18.840 --> 13:21.500
I believe "telepath" is the word you're looking for.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.750
Well, call it something else
if the word makes you uncomfortable,

13:23.820 --> 13:26.730
but the guy definitely knew what we were thinking.

13:26.780 --> 13:28.270
Interesting gift.

13:28.330 --> 13:30.500
I could think of a few practical applications for it.

13:30.550 --> 13:32.440
Dr. Ostman gave him some haloperidol.

13:32.490 --> 13:34.650
It calmed him down, quieted the noise some.

13:34.690 --> 13:37.110
So he can function as long as 
he's on antipsychotic meds?

13:37.170 --> 13:38.760
We don't have to fit him for any straitjacket,

13:38.810 --> 13:40.680
but he's not going to be hitting any knuckleballs either,

13:40.740 --> 13:44.190
which is all he wants to do.

13:44.260 --> 13:45.790
Yeah, i'll put ntac medical on it.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.810
If they can help him, they will.

13:47.890 --> 13:49.120
Great.

14:06.030 --> 14:07.020
Kyle baldwin.

14:07.070 --> 14:08.860
Social security number?

14:09.100 --> 14:10.950
There it is.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.060
Baldwin...

14:16.130 --> 14:17.660
nope.

14:17.740 --> 14:19.050
You're not eligible to register.

14:19.130 --> 14:20.360
Sure i am. I got in last semester.

14:20.410 --> 14:21.590
I just took deferred admissión.

14:21.650 --> 14:23.310
Except your tuition hasn't been paid.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.220
What are you talking about?

14:24.290 --> 14:25.450
My dad sent a check.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.680
Nope.

14:42.770 --> 14:43.620
Baldwin.

14:43.700 --> 14:44.700
Glad i caught you.

14:44.770 --> 14:46.460
I've got navarro's transfer forms right here.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.620
You sign them, he's on his way to ntac medical.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.030
Yeah, i will, but not just yet.

14:51.080 --> 14:51.600
Why not?

14:51.640 --> 14:53.910
Well, we want to know what 
Collier and ian dravitt are up to.

14:53.960 --> 14:57.420
A 4400 who can read minds just 
walked through the front door.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.430
You want to use navarro as a mole?

15:00.500 --> 15:01.480
Is that even legal?

15:01.530 --> 15:03.330
Mm-hmm. D.c. Cleared it.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.710
Well, how about ethical?

15:06.370 --> 15:07.920
Guy's asking us for help.

15:07.980 --> 15:09.760
Hell, he's even begging us.

15:09.830 --> 15:10.830
And we'll help him.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.190
But he's got to help us first.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.960
What if he says no?

15:15.040 --> 15:17.540
Then you'll get him to say yes.

15:29.140 --> 15:30.390
Excuse me.

15:30.470 --> 15:31.490
Can we get one more blanket?

15:31.550 --> 15:33.250
The one we have is kind of thin.

15:33.310 --> 15:34.760
Yeah, well, they're all kind of thin,

15:34.830 --> 15:37.010
but if you want to bring it down, i'll switch you.

15:37.090 --> 15:39.310
Oh, i think we might need both.

15:39.370 --> 15:40.580
You might think you need them,

15:40.630 --> 15:42.130
but you aren't going to get them.

15:42.190 --> 15:45.060
See, there's only so many rooms and so many blankets.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.190
And you have your allotment.

15:47.260 --> 15:49.420
My baby is cold.

15:49.510 --> 15:52.910
Can i please have one more blanket 
so she doesn't get sick?

15:57.840 --> 16:00.810
I'll give you five dollars.

16:07.870 --> 16:10.790
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.340
He wasn't very nice to us, was he?

16:34.760 --> 16:35.670
Here.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.760
Thank you

16:46.460 --> 16:47.830
What of thay catch me?

16:47.880 --> 16:50.150
We'll be monitoring you
every step of the way

16:50.210 --> 16:54.540
we plant a tiny transmitter/receiver
behind your ear under the skin

16:54.590 --> 16:56.660
takes 10 minutes, no scar

16:56.720 --> 16:59.310
if things go south
we'll be in there like the cavalry

16:59.370 --> 17:02.150
when i was a kid, my, uh

17:02.220 --> 17:05.569
my favorite show was
"the man from U.N.C.L.E."

17:07.960 --> 17:11.420
30 years, just gone in a snap

17:11.910 --> 17:13.210
my little brother is retiring

17:13.270 --> 17:16.099
from the tacoma police force
at the end of the year

17:16.170 --> 17:18.010
he's 53

17:18.099 --> 17:19.920
the guys i played ball with?

17:19.980 --> 17:23.040
The ones that made it to the majors are...

17:23.109 --> 17:26.780
signing autographs at card shows now

17:28.060 --> 17:30.270
the game is all i have

17:30.340 --> 17:32.140
yeah, i get that

17:32.210 --> 17:34.050
what, did you play ball?

17:34.140 --> 17:34.980
Senior year in college

17:35.040 --> 17:38.180
i blew my knee out
trying to slide under a tag

17:38.250 --> 17:39.530
what position?

17:39.600 --> 17:40.960
Third base

17:41.140 --> 17:43.760
another infielder, huh?

17:43.810 --> 17:45.770
You miss it?

17:45.980 --> 17:48.370
All the time

17:50.870 --> 17:52.800
but what we do here, gary

17:52.860 --> 17:56.010
what we're asking you to do for us...

17:56.700 --> 17:58.040
it's not the worid series

17:58.100 --> 18:02.140
but it's pretty damn important

18:11.090 --> 18:14.340
i do this for you guys...

18:14.830 --> 18:17.160
you're gonna fix me, right?

18:17.230 --> 18:19.140
You have my word

18:20.520 --> 18:22.180
okay

18:28.160 --> 18:29.990
sorry about dinner

18:30.290 --> 18:31.960
new case

18:32.890 --> 18:35.180
well, i'm glad you didn't wait for me

18:35.300 --> 18:37.010
that's what you're sorry about?

18:37.090 --> 18:38.130
Dinner?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.240
Ask me how my first day of college was

18:40.290 --> 18:41.400
how was your first day of college?

18:41.470 --> 18:42.540
I didn't have one

18:42.600 --> 18:44.600
nobody paid my tuition

18:44.630 --> 18:45.380
what are you talking about?

18:45.430 --> 18:48.050
Of course i did
that's ridiculous

18:48.360 --> 18:49.720
i tried calling you a bunch of times

18:49.770 --> 18:50.990
you didn't answer your phone

18:51.060 --> 18:52.050
i was in meetings all day

18:52.120 --> 18:54.260
i know i wrote that check

19:10.810 --> 19:11.930
that's great, dad

19:11.990 --> 19:13.880
i'm sorry, kyle
i must have forgot

19:13.930 --> 19:15.410
we've been talking about this for months

19:15.450 --> 19:16.470
how could you forget?

19:16.530 --> 19:17.990
Here. Bring it in tomorrow

19:18.040 --> 19:19.330
i'll send a note

19:19.380 --> 19:20.700
or i'll talk to the registrar myself

19:20.750 --> 19:22.800
whatever you want

19:23.300 --> 19:24.690
here

19:25.070 --> 19:26.980
kyle! Don't walk away from me

19:27.030 --> 19:28.940
just... look

19:30.150 --> 19:31.680
i admit it

19:31.750 --> 19:33.470
i'm not denying it, i screwed up

19:33.510 --> 19:34.480
but work's been a little crazy...

19:34.540 --> 19:35.850
oh, the job?

19:35.910 --> 19:38.720
I've been waiting for that one

19:38.950 --> 19:41.940
finally feels like old times around here

19:55.580 --> 19:57.030
what's this?

19:57.720 --> 19:59.165
Lily?

19:59.200 --> 20:00.000
What is it?

20:00.080 --> 20:04.370
Did you spend all the cash
buying this stuff?

20:05.370 --> 20:07.070
Then what? Talk to me

20:07.160 --> 20:10.300
the cash register at the front desk...

20:10.370 --> 20:12.350
was open...

20:13.730 --> 20:15.680
and we needed food

20:15.750 --> 20:18.210
and isabelle needed diapers

20:18.290 --> 20:19.670
you stole money?

20:19.730 --> 20:20.850
It's not like i planned it

20:20.890 --> 20:23.770
i mean, i had to beg for a blanket

20:23.830 --> 20:26.390
and the drawer was open, so...

20:26.430 --> 20:28.630
he left you standing there
with the cash register open?

20:28.710 --> 20:29.750
No, no, he closed it

20:29.820 --> 20:31.770
at least i thought he did
i don't know...

20:31.810 --> 20:33.540
it wasn't open, and then...

20:33.580 --> 20:34.970
and then it was open

20:35.040 --> 20:37.860
that still doesn't make it right

20:39.670 --> 20:42.270
that's not how i live my life

20:42.360 --> 20:44.430
have you looked around?

20:44.490 --> 20:47.940
'Cause this isn't how i planned
to live my life either

20:53.080 --> 20:54.880
look, i know it was wrong

20:54.940 --> 20:56.930
i don't need you
to tell me it was wrong

20:56.990 --> 20:59.490
stop shaking your head

21:05.550 --> 21:08.310
just eat something, okay?

21:08.380 --> 21:12.170
It's silly for all this food
to go to waste

21:14.030 --> 21:15.700
go ahead

21:16.780 --> 21:19.290
i'm not hungry

21:22.400 --> 21:23.670
how much fun was that?

21:23.740 --> 21:25.630
I liked it. Thank you

21:25.710 --> 21:26.910
so where have you two been?

21:26.970 --> 21:28.610
Your note just said "out."

21:28.670 --> 21:31.120
Lots of places
the pier, pike street

21:31.180 --> 21:32.790
and even the ferry

21:32.830 --> 21:34.550
what have you done to...

21:34.610 --> 21:35.900
you didn't!

21:35.970 --> 21:37.770
I told you she'd freak!

21:37.830 --> 21:39.440
Relax, they're rub-ons

21:39.510 --> 21:40.740
as in "fake."

21:40.820 --> 21:42.610
But they're pretty, aren't they?

21:42.670 --> 21:44.460
Oh, yeah, they're very pretty

21:44.520 --> 21:47.490
now why don't you go
get started on your homework?

21:47.580 --> 21:49.300
I'm in trouble

21:49.370 --> 21:51.360
do you at least like the shirt?

21:51.430 --> 21:52.530
And by the way...

21:52.590 --> 21:53.610
you live in seattle

21:53.660 --> 21:56.040
and your kid's never
heard of kurt cobain?

21:56.100 --> 21:57.520
What's wrong with you, di?

21:57.570 --> 21:58.950
Thank goodness you're here to teach her

21:59.000 --> 22:01.520
all about tattoos
and suicidal rock stars

22:01.580 --> 22:02.630
and by the way

22:02.700 --> 22:05.120
who gave you permissión
to take her out of school?

22:05.180 --> 22:07.360
I'm her aunt

22:07.440 --> 22:09.300
i didn't know i needed permissión

22:09.350 --> 22:11.240
well, if you're going
to send her teacher home for the day

22:11.290 --> 22:11.930
you do

22:12.000 --> 22:14.260
sitting at your kitchen table
all day long?

22:14.320 --> 22:15.590
Yeah, that's a big loss

22:15.640 --> 22:17.720
what are you keeping
this kid locked away for?

22:17.770 --> 22:20.390
If i wanted your opinion
on how i'm raising my daughter

22:20.460 --> 22:22.160
i'd ask

22:22.970 --> 22:24.020
mommy?

22:24.090 --> 22:25.950
What's wrong, sweetheart?

22:26.010 --> 22:28.830
I think i have to throw up

22:29.410 --> 22:31.550
what did you give her to eat?

22:31.630 --> 22:33.080
Anything she wanted

22:33.150 --> 22:36.800
oh. Good going, aunt april

22:46.330 --> 22:49.190
okay, guys, i'm going in

22:50.490 --> 22:51.640
collier's going to want to meet you

22:51.700 --> 22:53.620
you're one of the 4400

22:53.690 --> 22:55.430
anything you can learn about him is great

22:55.480 --> 22:57.950
but our main target is ian dravitt

22:58.020 --> 22:59.630
see what you can find out about him

22:59.700 --> 23:02.050
and why he's there

23:02.150 --> 23:04.260
you have a two-week supply of haloperidol

23:04.320 --> 23:05.380
it should keep your mind clear

23:05.430 --> 23:08.500
but hopefully you'll be done
in a couple of days

23:08.690 --> 23:10.720
excuse me

23:12.410 --> 23:14.350
cute. Nice shoes

23:14.420 --> 23:17.560
steer him over to the brochures

23:18.280 --> 23:19.880
welcome to the center

23:19.960 --> 23:21.450
my name's devon

23:21.530 --> 23:23.820
i'm gary navarro

23:24.070 --> 23:26.640
i'm kind of interested in
finding out what you guys do here

23:26.690 --> 23:29.070
well, i'd be happy to show you around

23:29.130 --> 23:31.830
have you read mr. Collier's book?

23:31.900 --> 23:34.390
I didn't have to
i lived it

23:36.180 --> 23:37.800
I'm one of the 4400.

23:37.870 --> 23:40.890
Oh. Well, welcome home.

23:45.670 --> 23:46.500
Gary Navarro

23:46.560 --> 23:47.840
Jordan Collier

23:47.910 --> 23:49.810
It's a real pleasure to meet you

23:49.950 --> 23:51.510
well, that's a nice firm grip

23:51.580 --> 23:54.150
i'd expect nothing less of
a promising second baseman

23:54.190 --> 23:55.490
how did you know i played ball?

23:55.550 --> 23:59.590
Well, it's my business
to know everything about the 4400

23:59.650 --> 24:03.080
so, uh... has anything shown up yet?

24:03.110 --> 24:04.300
An ability, or...

24:04.360 --> 24:05.370
no, not me

24:05.420 --> 24:08.950
i, uh, have a hard enough time
hitting a split-finger fastball

24:08.990 --> 24:10.910
it's kind of disappointing, isn't it?

24:10.960 --> 24:11.990
All those years lost?

24:12.050 --> 24:12.990
No abilities

24:13.040 --> 24:14.230
pass him off to devon

24:14.320 --> 24:15.280
get bac to dravitt

24:15.330 --> 24:17.540
jordan, we need to talk

24:17.580 --> 24:18.730
absolutely, shawn

24:18.770 --> 24:21.240

to meet a fellow returnee

24:21.280 --> 24:22.670
gary navarro. Hawn farrell

24:22.730 --> 24:23.780

24:23.830 --> 24:25.520
Shawn here's a little luckier
than you and i

24:25.570 --> 24:27.560
he came back with
quite a remarkable ability

24:27.620 --> 24:30.140
yeah, i'm blessed, all right
see the halo around my head?

24:30.220 --> 24:32.760
I really need to talk to you

24:32.860 --> 24:34.640
give us a second

24:36.270 --> 24:38.310
i've been doing some poking around
on the internet.

24:38.360 --> 24:39.270
I found out some stuff

24:39.340 --> 24:40.900
that you need to know
because, let me tell you

24:40.970 --> 24:42.880
i really hope that
you don't know already

24:42.940 --> 24:44.420
if it can be found on a search engine

24:44.470 --> 24:46.110
believe me, i know it

24:46.160 --> 24:48.850
you're okay with this dravitt guy?

24:49.110 --> 24:51.090
Eyes on the prize, remember?

24:51.150 --> 24:54.620
Doing business with our friend
does not make us our friend

24:54.680 --> 24:55.900
dravitt's not my friend

24:55.940 --> 24:57.620
he's a dangerous prick

24:57.680 --> 24:58.840
i'll meet you outside in 10 minutes

24:58.910 --> 25:01.350
as soon as i get gary squared away here

25:01.390 --> 25:03.420
we'll talk about it

25:05.340 --> 25:06.890
here you go

25:23.530 --> 25:25.060
hello?

25:25.370 --> 25:26.810
Hello?

25:26.970 --> 25:28.630
Are you all right?

25:30.110 --> 25:31.840
Whoa. Where was i?

25:31.910 --> 25:34.300
Far away, i think

25:34.670 --> 25:35.870
first day meltdown?

25:35.960 --> 25:38.490
Just lost and late

25:38.540 --> 25:40.930
and begging my way into classes
i don't even want to take

25:41.010 --> 25:43.250
not such a good day, then

25:43.340 --> 25:45.570
"introductory survey
of 19th-century novellas."

25:45.620 --> 25:47.550
Kill me now

25:47.610 --> 25:50.740
maybe it'll enlighten you in ways
you never could have imagined

25:50.790 --> 25:51.310
not likely

25:51.370 --> 25:54.060
it was the only thing open this period

25:54.700 --> 25:56.370
well, this is olin hall

25:56.430 --> 25:59.360
take the stairs inside to your left

26:01.230 --> 26:02.850
thanks

26:02.890 --> 26:04.640
maybe i'll see you around

26:04.720 --> 26:06.530
you never know

26:26.370 --> 26:27.650
hello, everybody

26:27.720 --> 26:28.770
i'm wendy paulson

26:28.830 --> 26:31.930
welcome to
intro to 19th-century novellas

26:31.990 --> 26:34.720
is everyone in the right place?

26:41.040 --> 26:43.930
I will speak to you after class

26:53.050 --> 26:54.030
i can't hear anything

26:54.080 --> 26:55.570
i'm going to try to get closer

26:55.630 --> 26:56.630
gary, what are you doing?

26:56.690 --> 26:57.860
Collier and that kid

26:57.920 --> 26:58.980
your nephew

26:59.040 --> 27:00.970
i think they're arguing
about that guy dravitt

27:01.040 --> 27:02.250
where are you?

27:03.070 --> 27:04.540
Gary, go inside

27:04.600 --> 27:06.340
getting a good eyeful?

27:06.400 --> 27:08.280
I'm just...

27:11.390 --> 27:12.250
should we pull him out?

27:12.320 --> 27:12.840
No, no, no, no, no

27:12.900 --> 27:14.390
not yet. Not yet

27:14.480 --> 27:16.620
maybe he can talk his way out of it

27:18.170 --> 27:19.870
now what the hell
do you think you're doing?

27:19.930 --> 27:20.930
Let him go

27:21.000 --> 27:25.120
you should be careful
who you let in your manor, my son

27:25.210 --> 27:27.730
we detained him
as a professional courtesy

27:27.780 --> 27:30.380
jordan, these guys are thugs

27:30.430 --> 27:33.040
no need for name-calling

27:33.100 --> 27:34.950
we merely happened upon this gentleman

27:35.020 --> 27:38.860
in the process of spying
on the two of you

27:39.520 --> 27:42.000
i had a couple of questions for you
that's all

27:42.040 --> 27:43.800
I mean, i saw you guys were
having an argument or something

27:43.860 --> 27:45.330
what am i supposed to do, interrupt?

27:45.370 --> 27:46.430
Want to know what we were talking about?

27:46.490 --> 27:47.530
Because it's no big secret

27:47.580 --> 27:48.100
i'll tell you exactly
what we were talking...

27:48.200 --> 27:50.070
shawn, enough

27:50.440 --> 27:52.150
you're going to find
i'm tied up a lot of the time

27:52.200 --> 27:53.880
Gary, if you have questions

27:53.930 --> 27:58.190
any of my staff...
will be happy to help

27:58.240 --> 28:00.200
yeah, sorry
next time i'll know better

28:00.260 --> 28:01.730
All right.

28:01.830 --> 28:04.250
Go on back inside.

28:12.880 --> 28:14.970
<i>Careful where he wanders.</i>

28:15.040 --> 28:19.040
<i>No one's getting
between me and $30 million.</i>

28:57.850 --> 28:58.890
Richard?

28:58.960 --> 29:00.370
What is it?
What's wrong?

29:00.440 --> 29:02.230
The police.

29:07.260 --> 29:09.050
Oh, my god.

29:09.130 --> 29:10.360
I'm so sorry.

29:10.420 --> 29:12.720
I'll tell them i took the money

29:13.060 --> 29:15.580
you didn't have anything to do with it

29:16.060 --> 29:17.860
police, open up

29:17.930 --> 29:19.220
give us a minute!

29:19.270 --> 29:21.470
Open up. Now!

29:22.130 --> 29:24.130
They're not after us

29:30.350 --> 29:32.290
we're okay

29:47.950 --> 29:49.720
guys? You there?

29:49.780 --> 29:50.770
Go ahead, gary

29:50.820 --> 29:52.750
yeah, sorry i've been so out of touch

29:52.800 --> 29:56.170
they had me in these classes all morning

29:56.670 --> 29:57.890
i haven't even seen collier all day

29:57.950 --> 29:59.060
or that other guy

29:59.120 --> 30:00.110
well, that's okay

30:00.140 --> 30:01.580
you just go where they tell you

30:01.640 --> 30:03.510
yeah, but i thought you said
you wanted to know more

30:03.560 --> 30:05.350
about that money that collier's shelling out?

30:05.400 --> 30:06.410
Where are my meds?

30:06.460 --> 30:07.200
Gary, what's wrong?

30:07.270 --> 30:09.340
My meds, they're gone. I don't...

30:13.650 --> 30:14.900
uh, excuse me?

30:14.970 --> 30:17.220
I, uh, i had a prescription

30:17.280 --> 30:18.730
some tranquilizers in my room

30:18.770 --> 30:19.950
and now they're gone

30:20.010 --> 30:21.660
you don't need those

30:21.720 --> 30:23.760
you've been conditioned
to think you need them

30:23.820 --> 30:26.230
taking anything that suppresses
your natural openness

30:26.290 --> 30:28.250
is counterintuitive to our program

30:28.350 --> 30:29.100
maybe you should sit through

30:29.150 --> 30:32.380
the nutrition and purification lecture again

30:40.690 --> 30:42.750
did you hear that, baldwin?

30:42.830 --> 30:44.330
They took the haloperidol!

30:44.390 --> 30:46.270
Yes, gary, i heard it

30:46.330 --> 30:48.820
you want to abort?
You want to walk out of there?

30:48.940 --> 30:50.840
Everything is just... just...

30:50.910 --> 30:53.060
getting louder in my head already

30:53.110 --> 30:54.460
it's already getting worse

30:54.510 --> 30:56.270
voices are starting
to bleed through the walls

30:56.310 --> 30:57.890
just calm down, gary.

30:57.950 --> 30:59.060
We'll come and get you if we need to.

30:59.090 --> 31:01.270
It's your call.

31:02.610 --> 31:03.630
Gary, talk to me.

31:03.880 --> 31:06.100
Okay. Um...

31:09.250 --> 31:11.590
y- y-you guys are going to hold up

31:11.660 --> 31:14.100
your end of this deal, right?

31:14.150 --> 31:16.700
Yes. Of course.

31:20.770 --> 31:22.360
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

31:22.420 --> 31:24.990
I'll, uh, i'll hold up my end,

31:25.030 --> 31:26.980
and i'll hang in as long as i can.

31:27.030 --> 31:29.760
Good. We'll hang in with you.

31:29.840 --> 31:30.610
Now, listen, gary,

31:30.670 --> 31:34.100
someone's going to be on this channel 24/7,remember?

31:35.740 --> 31:37.540
Yeah right

31:40.460 --> 31:42.130
right

32:20.410 --> 32:23.990
i, uh,
i read<the secret sharer>last night.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.110
Just like your syllabus said.
That's a good start.

32:26.170 --> 32:27.880
Well, not just the first 20 pages.

32:27.940 --> 32:29.990
I got really into it
i read the whole thing.

32:30.050 --> 32:33.200
19th-century novellas not quite
the hell on earth you expected?

32:33.240 --> 32:35.540
It definitely wasn't boring.

32:35.590 --> 32:36.960
I've got a lot of questions, though.

32:37.010 --> 32:39.930
Okay, well,
i have office hours wednesdays, one to four.

32:39.980 --> 32:41.710
Okay, yeah, i'll try to stop by.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.830
Or we could run by
the coop and grab some coffee?

32:44.890 --> 32:46.010
Like, right now?

32:46.070 --> 32:48.140
I like talking about joseph conrad.

32:48.190 --> 32:50.560
It's why i picked this for a living.

32:54.980 --> 32:57.580
Where did you learn to do all this?

32:57.650 --> 33:00.110
Mom never taught us to cook.

33:00.180 --> 33:02.420
I don't know
i just learned how.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.570
Had to be better than you at something.

33:06.090 --> 33:09.370
Aunt April, do you have any kids?

33:09.420 --> 33:10.550
Nope.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.860
No kids.

33:11.920 --> 33:12.730
Are you married?

33:12.790 --> 33:13.680
I used to be.

33:13.750 --> 33:15.910
Ask your mom what
she thought of my ex-husband.

33:15.960 --> 33:16.910
Don't start.

33:16.990 --> 33:17.710
You didn't like him?

33:17.780 --> 33:18.870
Neither did april, apparently.

33:18.950 --> 33:21.930
She only stayed with trevor for what, seven months?

33:21.980 --> 33:24.160
You were hostile from day one.

33:24.210 --> 33:25.930
You never gave him a chance.

33:25.990 --> 33:27.870
I didn't really think he deserved much of a chance.

33:27.910 --> 33:31.250
He was... kind of a moron.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.500
He was 22.

33:33.570 --> 33:36.720
Show me one guy who isn't a moron at 22.

33:36.770 --> 33:38.740
He knew you hated him,

33:38.810 --> 33:40.330
and that didn't make it any easier

33:40.380 --> 33:41.560
for us to stay together.

33:41.610 --> 33:42.130
Come on.

33:42.180 --> 33:43.940
You can't keep blaming that on me.

33:43.990 --> 33:45.550
I mean, just grow up.

33:45.610 --> 33:47.300
Okay, this was a mistake.

33:47.370 --> 33:48.850
I thought it was a good idea to come here,

33:48.920 --> 33:50.480
but obviously i was wrong.

33:50.520 --> 33:51.270
I'll go pack.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.820
There's a little hotel up the street.

33:52.870 --> 33:53.710
No!

33:53.770 --> 33:55.380
It's okay, honey. We'll still see...

33:55.450 --> 33:56.790
but the power's going to go out there tonight,

33:56.840 --> 33:59.320
and you won't have any lights.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.340
What is she talking about?

34:03.420 --> 34:06.250
Can i please be excused?

34:37.620 --> 34:39.550
Mr. Navarro, is something wrong?

34:39.590 --> 34:41.980
This is no good. I need my haloperidol.

34:42.030 --> 34:43.659
Where's collier?

34:43.770 --> 34:46.090
Mr. Collier's in a meeting.

34:46.850 --> 34:48.300
Mr. Navarro?

34:48.540 --> 34:50.400
Mr. Navarro...

34:53.190 --> 34:54.389
<i>[diana]: gary, what's wrong?</i>

34:54.449 --> 34:56.340
<i>[Gary]: i just got to talkto collier.</i>

34:56.409 --> 34:58.320
That's not a good idea, gary.

34:59.950 --> 35:01.140
Mr. Navarro...

35:01.210 --> 35:02.880
He's in a meeting!

35:03.160 --> 35:04.500
Make it stop.

35:04.590 --> 35:06.220
Please, make it stop.

35:06.280 --> 35:06.920
Make it stop.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.630
I need my medication.

35:08.680 --> 35:12.730
Whatever's eating you, old son, we'll make it stop.

35:12.790 --> 35:14.720
Count on that.

35:22.990 --> 35:24.760
A 4400 who can read minds?

35:24.810 --> 35:26.700
So you do have an ability.

35:26.760 --> 35:28.370
You shouldn't have lied to me, gary.

35:28.430 --> 35:30.490
You mean to tell me

35:30.540 --> 35:32.790
that this guy knows what i'm thinking?

35:32.840 --> 35:36.830
Because i do not like anyone inside my head but me.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.440
Jordan, this guy's one of us.

35:38.490 --> 35:40.330
We can't just stand here and let him get killed.

35:40.390 --> 35:41.710
Nobody's killing anyone.

35:41.770 --> 35:45.130
First we determine what our man here knows

35:45.180 --> 35:48.060
and then we discuss his fate.

35:48.920 --> 35:52.690
Because there are things i know that could get you killed!

35:52.750 --> 35:55.750
That could get all of you killed.

35:56.690 --> 35:59.090
Call jarvis. Tell her we're going in.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.390
Look, ian...

36:06.440 --> 36:07.720
shut up!

36:07.790 --> 36:09.900
Shut up now!

36:20.660 --> 36:23.250
Hi. I'm evan. Welcome to the 4400 center.

36:25.490 --> 36:27.270
Second level's not open to visitors.

36:27.330 --> 36:28.920
We're not visitors.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.400
Hey, look, buddy, i've got a badge too,

36:30.470 --> 36:32.010
and this is private property.

36:34.580 --> 36:36.600
What the hell's he doing to him?

36:36.660 --> 36:37.910
Let him go,

36:37.990 --> 36:38.740
or so help me,

36:38.780 --> 36:40.460
i'll splatter your brains

36:40.510 --> 36:42.520
all over your highly polished floor.

36:42.560 --> 36:44.390
Now, that is enough.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.920
Drop that weapon! Now!

36:50.120 --> 36:51.430
How the hell did you get in here?

36:51.480 --> 36:53.010
You don't sound so happy to see us.

36:53.060 --> 36:55.140
Well, now. What in the hell is this?

36:55.190 --> 36:56.440
NTAC agents.

36:56.490 --> 36:59.240
I don't appreciate the government interfering in my business.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.000
You should be more careful who you do business with.

37:01.050 --> 37:02.010
They're not buying weapons.

37:02.060 --> 37:04.390
They're planning a coup overseas, some tiny country.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.560
You sent a spy in here, uncle tommy?

37:06.610 --> 37:07.040
Good job.

37:07.090 --> 37:09.220
You almost got us all killed.

37:09.280 --> 37:10.670
You too, mr. Dravitt.

37:10.730 --> 37:11.970
Well, it'll be interesting to see

37:12.020 --> 37:15.380
if your friend's impressions will stand up in court.

37:16.420 --> 37:18.500
I guess i'm the one should be more careful

37:18.550 --> 37:21.580
who i do business with.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.530
Shawn, you can come with us if you want.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.010
Great.

37:30.070 --> 37:32.510
I'll tell your mother you said hello.

37:34.130 --> 37:37.060
Gary, you should have come to me first.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.690
I'd have treated you better than they ever will.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.100
<i>We're at war here.</i>

37:41.160 --> 37:43.380
<i>Don't pick the losing side.</i>

37:51.720 --> 37:53.870
Look at the cute little baby.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.300
I think somebody wants to try your toy, walt.

37:57.350 --> 37:59.230
I think you're right.

38:02.050 --> 38:02.840
Hi.

38:02.910 --> 38:04.000
Hi.

38:04.410 --> 38:05.910
Put her back in the car?

38:05.990 --> 38:07.030
Why?

38:07.100 --> 38:09.000
Now, please.

38:17.170 --> 38:18.560
What's your problem?

38:18.630 --> 38:20.090
That little boy was being sweet with her.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.940
I just didn't want anybody getting hurt.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.750
Hurt? Who's going to get hurt?

38:23.810 --> 38:24.860
What if she doesn't want to give the toy back?

38:24.910 --> 38:26.800
What's going to happen then?

38:26.870 --> 38:27.610
Don't look at me

38:27.660 --> 38:29.200
like you don't know what i'm talking about.

38:29.250 --> 38:30.620
Those three men in the woods...

38:30.680 --> 38:32.220
they wanted us dead.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.790
You saw what happened to them. That was isabelle.

38:33.850 --> 38:34.540
We both know it,

38:34.600 --> 38:35.870
and there's no use in pretending otherwise.

38:35.930 --> 38:38.990
Whatever isabelle does, she does it out of love for us.

38:39.060 --> 38:40.360
She's our daughter, richard.

38:40.420 --> 38:41.360
I know she is.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.850
I love her right back, but she's something else too,

38:43.900 --> 38:46.450
and i wish to god i knew what that was.

38:53.190 --> 38:54.710
What is it?

38:56.030 --> 38:57.450
What's wrong?

39:07.500 --> 39:08.880
I'm fine.

39:39.140 --> 39:40.090
So, what?

39:40.150 --> 39:42.130
So collier planned to spend $30 million

39:42.190 --> 39:44.520
funding mercenary activity in sao tome?

39:44.550 --> 39:47.190
They've had three coups since their independence in '75.

39:47.240 --> 39:48.250
My guess?

39:48.310 --> 39:50.450
Collier was trying to buy number four.

39:50.520 --> 39:51.190
Did gary happen to hear

39:51.240 --> 39:53.030
why collier's so interested in an island

39:53.070 --> 39:54.260
off the west coast of africa?

39:54.310 --> 39:55.410
Without his medication,

39:55.460 --> 39:57.470
we're lucky to have got that much out of him.

39:57.510 --> 39:58.220
Yeah, but we do know

39:58.290 --> 40:01.110
that collier thinks he's headed towards a conflict with someone

40:01.140 --> 40:03.490
ntac, the entire government, i don't know.

40:03.540 --> 40:05.850
He installs a friendly government in sao tome.

40:05.900 --> 40:07.610
It could have been a place to go when things heat up.

40:07.660 --> 40:10.080
What, like a homeland for the 4400?

40:10.120 --> 40:13.130
Too bad you can't prosecute a man 
for delusions of grandeur.

40:13.180 --> 40:14.460
They're not delusions

40:14.510 --> 40:16.420
if you can make them come true.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.130
We're always one step behind collier

40:18.170 --> 40:21.420
because we keep seeing him as some kind of cult nut.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.630
What we should be asking ourselves is,

40:23.680 --> 40:25.110
before collier was abducted,

40:25.150 --> 40:26.460
did he ever set his mind to something

40:26.490 --> 40:28.680
and... not get it done?

40:28.730 --> 40:31.140
They didn't make him any dumber in that ball of light.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.090
Well, anyway, we wanted to know 
what Collier was thinking.

40:33.140 --> 40:34.930
Gary found out for us.

40:34.980 --> 40:38.010
Time to turn him over to NTAC medical, right?

40:38.430 --> 40:39.550
Soon.

40:40.470 --> 40:41.300
"Soon"?

40:41.350 --> 40:42.560
The nsa is cc'd

40:42.610 --> 40:45.080
any time we register a new 4400 ability.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.370
They have been leaning on d.c.

40:46.420 --> 40:49.130
To borrow gary for an op they've got planned.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.550
No... no more cloak-and-dagger stuff.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.640
He'll sit in on a few conferences.

40:53.690 --> 40:54.840
You know how it is with diplomats.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.370
They don't always say what they think.

40:56.430 --> 40:59.260
That wasn't the agreement i made with him.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.520
But terms have changed.

41:00.610 --> 41:02.470
Gary's too valuable.

41:03.450 --> 41:04.560
I gave him my word.

41:04.620 --> 41:07.110
You're turning me into a liar.

41:07.710 --> 41:09.750
You've been in the game almost 20 years.

41:09.810 --> 41:10.330
My guess is,

41:10.390 --> 41:12.770
you've committed all the seven deadly sins,

41:12.820 --> 41:14.170
just like the rest of us.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.640
I should have let him stay with collier.

41:15.700 --> 41:17.160
He might have used him, but he 
would've helped him too.

41:17.230 --> 41:20.450
Don't you ever use me again.

41:31.300 --> 41:33.980
All i wanted was to play ball.

41:34.440 --> 41:35.480
You guys promised to help,

41:35.540 --> 41:38.180
but you can't do that, can you?

41:46.220 --> 41:47.680
We're worried about the 4400.

41:47.730 --> 41:51.800
It seems more and more like they should be worried about us.

41:52.350 --> 41:54.670
You know that bar, mel's?

41:54.720 --> 41:56.610
Corner of lancaster and third?

41:56.660 --> 41:58.680
You feel like joining me?

41:58.740 --> 42:01.030
We don't go to bars.

42:01.110 --> 42:04.060
Well, i'm going tonight, with you or without you.
