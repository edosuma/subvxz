[radio chatter in distance]

01:42.211 --> 01:44.213
[debris shifting]

01:47.341 --> 01:48.843
[engine revving]

01:48.927 --> 01:50.261
- [man] All the way.
- [indistinct radio chatter]

01:50.344 --> 01:52.305
Break it up a little bit. There you go.

01:52.388 --> 01:55.016
Pin that area.
That needs to be cut, as well.

01:55.099 --> 01:59.062
- Johnson. Yeah, I see it. I see it.
- Right.

01:59.145 --> 02:01.189
[conversation continues indistinctly]

02:07.236 --> 02:08.613
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:08.697 --> 02:10.281
Any survivors?

02:10.364 --> 02:12.075
Inside, your guess is as good as ours.

02:12.158 --> 02:13.159
We're lucky only the restaurant

02:13.242 --> 02:15.411
and the apartments above collapsed,
and not the whole structure.

02:15.494 --> 02:16.788
This could've been a hell of a lot worse.

02:16.871 --> 02:18.623
- Who's this guy?
- [firefighter] Chinese guy's the owner.

02:18.707 --> 02:21.250
Says his wife and their tenant
were in the restaurant when it happened.

02:21.334 --> 02:25.213
Can you, uh...
give me a call if anything changes?

02:25.296 --> 02:27.340
- No problem.
- What's the matter?

02:28.507 --> 02:31.385
This is... Luke Cage's place.

02:34.848 --> 02:36.725
Rafe, this was outside in,

02:36.808 --> 02:38.101
- not inside out.
- [Scarfe] Uh-huh.

02:38.184 --> 02:41.104
Or there'd be shit
all across the street like projectiles

02:41.187 --> 02:43.648
if the explosion had been on the inside.

02:47.526 --> 02:51.615
If that damn thing works,
we get answers?

02:51.698 --> 02:53.783
If that damn thing works.

02:53.867 --> 02:56.160
I'll call the precinct,
tell 'em we're on our way,

02:56.244 --> 02:57.829
have 'em cue up the footage.

02:58.872 --> 03:01.875
Hey, they got their job to do,
we got our job to do.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.091
Sir.

03:10.174 --> 03:13.386
Are you sure
Luke Cage is in there with her?

03:13.469 --> 03:15.722
I think so. Not really sure.

03:33.406 --> 03:36.075
[Rackham] <i>Shut up!</i>
<i>In here, you got no voice.</i>

03:36.993 --> 03:38.912
<i>You got no rights.</i>

03:38.995 --> 03:40.579
<i>You used to be a citizen...</i>

03:41.623 --> 03:44.500
<i>but from the moment you reached</i>
<i>the bottom of stupid,</i>

03:44.583 --> 03:46.836
<i>your dumb asses</i>
<i>belonged to the state of Georgia.</i>

03:46.920 --> 03:49.130
<i>- If you are a recidivist...</i>
- Bend over.

03:49.213 --> 03:51.465
<i>- ...then you know the rules.</i>
- Cough.

03:51.549 --> 03:53.885
<i>- If, however...</i>
- [coughs]

03:53.968 --> 03:56.721
...this is your first visit
to the Seagate theme park...

03:56.805 --> 03:58.222
let me just say...

03:59.766 --> 04:02.852
long as you follow the rules,
you'll be fine.

04:02.936 --> 04:04.520
Rule number one.

04:05.939 --> 04:09.358
You will obey every rule I say
after rule number one.

04:10.193 --> 04:11.986
Rule number two.

04:12.070 --> 04:15.323
None but the righteous shall see God.

04:15.406 --> 04:17.408
And since we ain't got
no righteous people in here,

04:17.491 --> 04:20.411
God ain't gonna have to worry about
your shitty prayers.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.748
So that means
I'm his mean, shitty substitute.

04:23.832 --> 04:24.916
[Luke scoffs]

04:26.668 --> 04:28.169
Rule number three.

04:29.212 --> 04:30.588
Ain't no talking when I'm talking.

04:30.672 --> 04:32.090
[grunts and coughs]

04:33.717 --> 04:35.927
Don't start a fight
if you can't take a punch.

04:36.010 --> 04:40.139
I'm surprised I had to tell
a former law officer to follow the rules.

04:40.223 --> 04:43.017
[straining] New life.
Not quite used to it yet.

04:43.101 --> 04:44.936
[Rackham] Yeah, well...

04:45.436 --> 04:49.107
Come on.
Good thing you have many years to adjust.

04:51.275 --> 04:53.652
And remember, how you start...

04:55.363 --> 04:57.824
is how you end in places like this.

04:57.907 --> 05:00.034
No one does it alone.

05:03.913 --> 05:07.625
- All right, get 'em to their cells.
- [guard] You heard him. Let's go.

05:14.841 --> 05:17.010
[breathing heavily]

05:26.519 --> 05:28.146
[yelling]

05:29.981 --> 05:31.816
[crying]

05:33.276 --> 05:34.944
I didn't do it.

05:35.028 --> 05:37.030
[men shouting in distance]

05:47.874 --> 05:52.045
Just remember who you are...
and you'll get through this.

05:53.296 --> 05:54.672
[breathing heavily]

05:54.755 --> 05:56.299
[softly] Carl Lucas.

05:58.259 --> 06:00.386
I am Carl Lucas.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.473
Damn it.

06:04.557 --> 06:06.225
I'm Carl Lucas.

06:08.227 --> 06:11.147
[Reva] If you don't make attempts
to befriend someone,

06:11.230 --> 06:14.067
loneliness is guaranteed
to eat you alive.

06:18.321 --> 06:19.864
Let's start with you, Reggie.

06:19.948 --> 06:21.615
In here, I'm Squabbles.

06:21.699 --> 06:26.329
Reggie... he had a job, family, a life.

06:26.412 --> 06:27.872
You still have a family.

06:27.956 --> 06:30.583
I haven't seen my family in years.

06:30.666 --> 06:35.629
I asked them for forgiveness.
It seems like they don't really care.

06:35.713 --> 06:37.715
[Reva] How have you dealt with it?

06:37.798 --> 06:41.135
I haven't seen my family
since the first time I was here.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.472
Now I just take it one day at a time.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.683
[inmates agreeing indistinctly]

06:50.353 --> 06:51.437
Carl?

06:54.773 --> 06:59.695
I don't need to, want to
or have to get to know anybody.

07:01.114 --> 07:04.533
That's like
placing yourself in solitary...

07:04.617 --> 07:06.327
without actually going to the hole.

07:06.410 --> 07:08.704
You can't trust nobody
in a place like this.

07:09.205 --> 07:10.789
'Cause you used to be a cop?

07:10.874 --> 07:12.917
[inmates murmuring]

07:13.001 --> 07:14.836
I ain't the first cop to do time.

07:16.087 --> 07:19.423
And I ain't ever sent nobody to Seagate,
so I ain't got that problem.

07:20.549 --> 07:25.179
But trust in places like this...
sets you up for failure.

07:27.390 --> 07:29.767
[Squabbles]
You know she ain't mean no harm.

07:29.851 --> 07:32.478
Reminding you of what you ain't got
can be pretty damn mean.

07:32.561 --> 07:34.438
Or it can help you focus.

07:34.522 --> 07:37.733
You know, this type of loneliness in here,
it can kill.

07:38.734 --> 07:40.528
Not if you stay strong.

07:40.611 --> 07:42.864
And if you believe that, you're dumb.

07:42.947 --> 07:45.324
You know, strength has its limits.

07:45.408 --> 07:47.326
Everybody eventually caves.

07:48.827 --> 07:51.705
If you're looking for a friend,
keep looking, Squabbles.

07:52.623 --> 07:55.334
It can't be that hard
finding one in a place like this.

07:56.585 --> 07:59.797
Yeah, it is...
and most of them act like you.

08:02.758 --> 08:04.802
[indistinct chatter on PA]

08:11.475 --> 08:12.894
[Shades] That the dude you mentioned?

08:13.686 --> 08:15.604
[Rackham] Yeah, that's him.

08:17.481 --> 08:20.109
They say three things get a cop locked up.

08:21.444 --> 08:23.321
Pride, power, or pussy.

08:23.404 --> 08:25.990
Yeah, well, I take pride
in my power over pussy,

08:26.074 --> 08:27.825
and I ain't never seen a day in lock-up.

08:29.243 --> 08:30.744
What's he in here for?

08:31.245 --> 08:33.121
[Rackham] I've seen his jacket.

08:33.206 --> 08:35.791
With that amount of years
for what they said he did...

08:35.874 --> 08:38.544
[chuckling] I'm guessing
he pissed someone off good.

08:39.169 --> 08:41.297
Ah, he was sent here to rot.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.218
Yo, man, time's up.

08:50.348 --> 08:52.433
[Comanche] What you wanna do?

08:52.516 --> 08:55.686
See if he bends or breaks.

09:07.448 --> 09:09.867
[grunting and straining]

09:10.826 --> 09:11.995
[Luke grunting]

09:13.787 --> 09:15.498
[all grunting]

09:26.425 --> 09:28.136
[groaning]

09:30.054 --> 09:32.098

09:32.181 --> 09:34.600
[all grunting]

09:37.728 --> 09:39.813
[both coughing]

09:42.108 --> 09:45.278
I'm not just gonna take shit
because you're dishing it out, you hear?

09:46.195 --> 09:47.613
[guard] Hands in the air!

09:49.157 --> 09:50.908
I'm just trying to survive!

09:51.700 --> 09:52.951
[grunts]

09:55.163 --> 09:57.456
Guess I found me a gladiator.

09:57.540 --> 09:59.292
[breathing heavily]

10:02.628 --> 10:04.047
[shutter slides open]

10:05.006 --> 10:07.300
[Rackham]
Well, you're a hell of a fighter, Lucas.

10:07.383 --> 10:09.302
You learn that in the military...

10:10.386 --> 10:12.680
or during your police training?

10:12.763 --> 10:13.972
Hmm?

10:14.057 --> 10:16.850
How'd you like to live like a king...

10:16.934 --> 10:19.270
using them fists of yours?

10:19.353 --> 10:24.192
We got some bad boys
who's pretty good with their hands.

10:24.275 --> 10:27.236
And they making money in here.
Good-ass money.

10:28.237 --> 10:29.947
I want you to get in on this.

10:31.365 --> 10:34.118
Believe it or not,
it'll benefit both of us.

10:34.202 --> 10:37.413
And I get a little extra coin.
And you... [clicks tongue]

10:37.496 --> 10:38.956
if you survive...

10:40.041 --> 10:42.293
get to be your own man.

10:42.376 --> 10:48.216
Untouched, extra rations,
maybe a conjugal or two, hmm?

10:49.342 --> 10:51.177
It's a good offer, convict.

10:52.095 --> 10:54.097
Slavery was always a good offer...

10:55.389 --> 10:56.890
to a master.

11:03.231 --> 11:05.149
[men shouting in distance]

11:17.120 --> 11:18.454
[grunting softly]

11:29.507 --> 11:30.758
Connie.

11:30.841 --> 11:33.177
- Connie!
- [groans]

11:33.261 --> 11:35.721
- [Luke sighs]
- [groaning]

11:37.055 --> 11:38.516
Ow. What happened?

11:38.599 --> 11:40.226
The building fell on us.

11:41.185 --> 11:42.395
[Connie] How?

11:42.478 --> 11:46.815
Something came flying at the building,
and I got you out of the way.

11:46.899 --> 11:50.819
[coughing] My... my leg... is trapped.

11:50.903 --> 11:53.322
- [shuddering] I smell...
- [Luke] Gas.

11:53.406 --> 11:56.575
We're not going to have a lot of time,
but we have to be careful.

11:56.659 --> 11:57.951
[panting]

11:58.035 --> 12:02.498
If this rubble shifts the wrong way
or if we make the wrong move...

12:02.581 --> 12:04.667
it could set off a spark
and this whole place could blow.

12:04.750 --> 12:08.796
Who do you think's gonna move the rubble?
You? Me?

12:10.381 --> 12:12.300
You think they can get to us?

12:13.050 --> 12:14.802
If they can't get to us,
we gonna have to get to them.

12:14.885 --> 12:16.053
How?

12:20.391 --> 12:21.850
Okay, Connie.

12:22.935 --> 12:25.188
The best way I can put this is...

12:27.565 --> 12:28.899
I'm kind of strong.

12:37.658 --> 12:39.910
[whispering] Holy shit!

12:46.792 --> 12:49.253
- [grunting]
- [rubble shifting]

12:55.384 --> 12:56.802
[groaning]

13:02.766 --> 13:05.353
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

13:05.436 --> 13:06.854
Hey, you wanna play?

13:08.188 --> 13:12.150
Hey, man, I'm talking to you.
Wake up! Hey, wake up!

13:19.325 --> 13:21.118
[Squabbles] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:21.201 --> 13:24.580
You think can't nobody read that look
a thousand miles out?

13:25.623 --> 13:29.793
Cop a squat before you do
something stupid like catch a body.

13:30.919 --> 13:32.713
You know, the best way
to stay out of the hole

13:32.796 --> 13:35.883
is to stay out of your head,
especially when it's full of hate.

13:47.603 --> 13:49.272
[grunting]

13:50.439 --> 13:52.107
[sighing loudly]

13:52.190 --> 13:53.317
[inhaling deeply]

13:53.401 --> 13:56.529
Breathe some of this fresh air,
young blood.

13:56.612 --> 13:58.281
Count down your days.

14:04.370 --> 14:07.039
[Squabbles] Man, you outta your mind?
You mean to tell me...

14:07.122 --> 14:12.085
[stuttering] this cover
of <i>Rolling Stone</i> with Lisa Bonet, and...

14:12.169 --> 14:17.675
the hair, the...
the nakedness, her eyes on me...

14:17.758 --> 14:20.636
- On you?
- On me!

14:20.719 --> 14:23.556
You mean to tell me this ain't hot?

14:23.639 --> 14:27.893
Says it right here, on the cover.
"The Hot Issue."

14:27.976 --> 14:32.147
Come out of the time machine, Squabs.
There's a lot of new honeys out there.

14:32.230 --> 14:34.983
You don't know nothing about Beyoncé?

14:35.067 --> 14:36.485
Nicki Minaj?

14:36.569 --> 14:39.697
- Lisa Bonet's daughter?
- She got a daughter?

14:39.780 --> 14:41.198
[indistinct chatter over TV]

14:42.283 --> 14:43.867
Zoë.

14:43.951 --> 14:46.745
Or like I call her, Godfather, Part Two.

14:49.373 --> 14:51.459
The sequel better than the original?

14:51.542 --> 14:52.960
[Luke] Close.

14:53.043 --> 14:55.921
Look, I was defendin' myself
killing that dude.

14:56.004 --> 14:58.841
- But you went to his house.
- It was... Whatcha... whatcha call it?

14:58.924 --> 15:01.969
- Preventative.
- Just more excuses.

15:02.052 --> 15:04.096
That's all I've heard
for the last 20 minutes.

15:04.179 --> 15:06.724
I mean, do any of you
ever say to yourself,

15:06.807 --> 15:09.685
"I... I have to take responsibility
for what I did,

15:09.768 --> 15:10.853
the reason I'm here"?

15:10.936 --> 15:12.646
What, you mean,
like, the... the 12 steps?

15:12.730 --> 15:15.649
Yeah, yeah, unless you were set up.

15:15.733 --> 15:17.318
I know I was set up.

15:17.401 --> 15:18.777
- [chuckling]
- [inmate] Me, too.

15:18.861 --> 15:22.573
- [inmates agreeing indistinctly]
- Even if you were set up...

15:22.656 --> 15:26.076
you have to see your involvement
in what went down.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.620
You ever say that to yourself?

15:29.246 --> 15:31.540
You ask these men
to come clean with themselves,

15:31.624 --> 15:33.459
and they don't know a thing about you.

15:34.877 --> 15:38.589
What gives you the right to listen to us,
but not share anything about yourself?

15:38.672 --> 15:40.549
That's not my role.

15:40.633 --> 15:43.427
- Trust has to be earned.
- True.

15:44.428 --> 15:46.722
Maybe if you tell us
what you're fighting...

15:46.805 --> 15:48.891
we'll be a little more open
to do the same.

15:50.934 --> 15:54.438
Did you do something wrong
that you need to take responsibility for?

15:56.940 --> 15:59.943
- I did.
- What happened?

16:00.027 --> 16:03.155
Was it a brother, sister,
or family member that you

16:03.238 --> 16:05.073
didn't focus on like you should have,

16:05.157 --> 16:08.452
while you were growing your life,
earning your degree?

16:16.669 --> 16:18.003
Time's up, guys.

16:24.259 --> 16:26.011
Mr. Lucas?

16:29.014 --> 16:30.223
Two minutes.

16:41.151 --> 16:43.070
Most you've said since you've been here.

16:44.154 --> 16:46.990
I might have gone
a few words past necessary.

16:49.242 --> 16:52.996
My brother, he died in jail
while I was getting my masters.

16:54.957 --> 16:59.002
I knew he needed help, but at the time
I felt I did all I could do, and I have...

16:59.086 --> 17:02.673
[inhales] regretted feeling
that way ever since.

17:04.842 --> 17:07.470
- Sorry I pressed.
- You did.

17:09.304 --> 17:11.306
But don't be sorry.

17:11.388 --> 17:14.602
And don't act
like you did it for the guys 'cause...

17:14.685 --> 17:16.686
you did it to keep me from pressing you.

17:19.482 --> 17:20.691
Guilty.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.736
What did that question spark in you?

17:26.864 --> 17:31.034
I know...
what it's like to be on this side.

17:32.202 --> 17:35.664
And... from where I'm at...

17:36.582 --> 17:39.001
that idea seems like bullshit.

17:39.084 --> 17:42.045
[scoffing] You innocent?

17:43.130 --> 17:44.548
Doesn't matter.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.427
[sighs]

17:53.682 --> 17:54.975
You are.

17:56.018 --> 17:59.480
I'm guilty of a lot of things
that people will never know about.

18:01.064 --> 18:04.067
I guess it's karma's way
of reminding me...

18:04.985 --> 18:06.529
that she can be a bitch.

18:07.279 --> 18:09.072
You should tell the group that.

18:10.533 --> 18:12.325
You really do care, don't you?

18:13.827 --> 18:14.953
I do.

18:23.546 --> 18:25.088
[guard] Let's go, Carl.

18:29.259 --> 18:32.805
It's not often I see a prisoner
leave you speechless.

18:33.556 --> 18:34.890
[sighs]

18:37.184 --> 18:38.811
He's in prison, but...

18:38.894 --> 18:42.064
[inhaling sharply] he's not a prisoner.

18:42.147 --> 18:44.024
Slo-mo, frame by frame.

18:46.902 --> 18:48.612
[man] It wasn't a gas leak.

18:49.487 --> 18:51.740
That was not a gas leak.

18:51.824 --> 18:54.117
Who the hell would use a rocket in Harlem?

18:54.201 --> 18:55.953
Who do you think?

18:58.288 --> 19:03.293
So, some of the inmates think people
are being experimented on in Seagate?

19:03.376 --> 19:04.419
Yes.

19:05.337 --> 19:07.005
Jimmy Quinto said that, uh,

19:07.089 --> 19:11.176
he was gonna get his sentence reduced
if he went through some experiments.

19:12.135 --> 19:14.722
- Now, was he lying?
- [chuckling] Of course he was.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.975
He probably did a plea bargain...
[stammers] or testified.

19:18.058 --> 19:20.644
Jimmy Quinto? A snitch?

19:20.728 --> 19:23.480
- Nah. No way.
- [inmate] Nah.

19:23.564 --> 19:25.148
He ain't here.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.610
Ain't nobody heard of him dying, so...

19:27.693 --> 19:30.528
[Reva] I know you all think
because Seagate is privately owned,

19:30.613 --> 19:33.907
there's some <i>X-Files</i> stuff
permeating the place.

19:33.991 --> 19:35.075
There isn't.

19:35.158 --> 19:38.411
Just think about all the stories
you've heard about Seagate.

19:38.495 --> 19:42.124
The ghost stories,
millionaires hidden in dungeons.

19:43.166 --> 19:45.586
[chuckling]
Tupac still alive on an island.

19:45.669 --> 19:47.045
So he just got out?

19:47.129 --> 19:49.506
More than likely, Jimmy just got out.

19:50.966 --> 19:53.636
Only problem is you work for Seagate.

19:54.261 --> 19:57.640
So, if it is true...
why would you admit it?

19:58.431 --> 19:59.808
Good point.

20:01.476 --> 20:03.604
I give you my word, Carl.

20:04.688 --> 20:07.149
There are no experiments happening here.

20:09.526 --> 20:12.237
Damn, long as I've been coming here,

20:12.320 --> 20:15.490
I ain't never heard her give her word,
young blood.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.665
[Reva] You know, I appreciate this,
you staying behind.

20:26.835 --> 20:30.255
Took me a while to realize
that I was raised with manners.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.676
Should've done this a long time ago.

20:34.592 --> 20:38.681
Stacking chairs is easier than talking.

20:40.641 --> 20:42.184
Why can't I get you to talk?

20:44.352 --> 20:45.478
Hmm?

20:46.897 --> 20:49.566
You're not a murderer.
You're not some serial killer.

20:49.650 --> 20:52.235
You're a man who trusted the wrong people.

20:52.319 --> 20:56.364
You made a few stupid mistakes...
caught a bad break.

20:56.448 --> 20:58.575
Do you know how I caught that bad break?

21:00.577 --> 21:02.204
Talking to people.

21:03.246 --> 21:05.916
- Trusting them.
- So why do you come here?

21:07.334 --> 21:09.127
Because you provide hope.

21:10.212 --> 21:11.254
Thank you.

21:11.964 --> 21:14.758
When you're not trying to hit somebody
with that hierarchy of needs shit...

21:14.842 --> 21:16.593
Oh, you couldn't just be nice, could you?

21:16.677 --> 21:19.096
- I have a reputation to live up to.
- [chuckling]

21:19.179 --> 21:20.931
Back away, Lucas.

21:27.730 --> 21:29.272
I guess I gotta go.

21:46.373 --> 21:47.958
[door closes]

21:49.667 --> 21:50.878
[Rackham chuckling]

21:52.170 --> 21:53.421
Doc Connors, huh?

21:54.339 --> 21:57.509
[chuckling] Getting caught up with her
ain't the smartest thing,

21:57.592 --> 22:00.012
but, man, she's gorgeous,
I'll give you that.

22:01.013 --> 22:03.098
- You looking out for me now?
- Why, you want pussy?

22:03.181 --> 22:04.599
I can get you that.

22:04.682 --> 22:07.102
You ain't got to wet dream
about Doc Connors.

22:07.185 --> 22:09.354
You want extra shit?
I'll get you that, too.

22:09.437 --> 22:12.565
This about me fighting for you?
That's not the lane I want to play in.

22:12.649 --> 22:15.235
[chuckling] You must smell a lot of shit

22:15.318 --> 22:17.404
having your ass
on your shoulders all the time.

22:17.487 --> 22:19.489
I make you an easy offer,
throw in some perks,

22:19.572 --> 22:20.991
and you just shrug 'em off.

22:21.074 --> 22:24.119
Well, it's lucky I'm a patient man.

22:24.202 --> 22:26.204
Smart enough to know you'd say no.

22:26.288 --> 22:28.456
Gave me time to build a backup plan.

22:35.338 --> 22:37.090
Squabbles, put down that shiv!

22:37.174 --> 22:38.216
[blowing whistle]

22:41.887 --> 22:43.889
You don't fight,
I tear your little world apart,

22:43.972 --> 22:45.515
starting with your homie Squabbles.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.351
- [Squabbles grunting]
- [guard] Get down! Get down!

22:48.435 --> 22:49.937
Stay seated! Stay seated!

22:50.020 --> 22:52.564
- [grunting]
- Look at me when I'm talking to you.

22:54.691 --> 22:56.068
Rackham, stop!

22:56.151 --> 22:59.696
I don't move quick, your man's gonna get
another 20 years, easy. Or life.

22:59.779 --> 23:02.115
You want this stopped,
you tell me what I wanna hear.

23:03.992 --> 23:06.161
- [blowing whistle]
- [guard] Stop moving!

23:07.162 --> 23:08.288
You son of a bitch.

23:08.371 --> 23:11.291
Yeah, that's "smart son of a bitch"
to you.

23:13.210 --> 23:14.711
You want me?

23:16.546 --> 23:18.841
Squabbles has to be by my side
every step of the way.

23:18.924 --> 23:21.134
[breathing heavily] Only way I fight.

23:21.969 --> 23:25.889
Can't believe you fell for
the club in the gut again. [chuckling]

23:28.558 --> 23:30.018
[rap music playing]

23:31.144 --> 23:33.646
[Squabbles] You know,
strategy's name of the game,

23:33.730 --> 23:35.690
you want to whip some serious ass.

23:38.360 --> 23:39.987
Stay on your center line.

23:41.071 --> 23:45.367
Head, chin, chest, stomach,
and if you have to,

23:45.450 --> 23:47.160
get at them nuts.

23:47.244 --> 23:49.246
Stay inside your man's shoulders.

23:51.289 --> 23:53.375
You used to box?

23:54.001 --> 23:56.962
I used to live on 42nd Street
back in the day.

23:57.045 --> 24:01.049
[chuckling] Uh, <i>Five Deadly Venoms,</i>

24:01.133 --> 24:02.885
<i>Clan of the White Lotus,</i>

24:02.968 --> 24:05.137
<i>Five Fingers of Death.</i>

24:05.803 --> 24:08.640
You think you can fight
because you watch kung fu flicks?

24:08.723 --> 24:13.395
I know I can fight because
I owned that corner back when I sold dope.

24:13.478 --> 24:16.273
And any asshole who tried to take
anything from me

24:16.356 --> 24:20.610
learned up close how I became
Golden Glove champ for seven years.

24:21.904 --> 24:25.157
Watched kung fu flicks
when I wasn't on the corner.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.159
What was your favorite movie?

24:28.743 --> 24:30.412
Jet Li.

24:30.495 --> 24:34.582
Uh, the remake of <i>Chinese Connection,</i>
<i>Fist of Legend.</i>

24:34.666 --> 24:36.751
Better than the original.

24:36.834 --> 24:39.587
You'd choose Jet over Bruce?

24:41.048 --> 24:44.217
Nah... you can't oversee my training.

24:46.261 --> 24:48.221
I can have an opinion.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.975
It's like assholes. Everyone's got one.

24:59.149 --> 25:00.817
[Comanche] You know how this goes?

25:01.818 --> 25:05.113
You win, you get whatever
you want up in this joint.

25:05.197 --> 25:08.158
Booze, bitches, extra rations,
shit like that.

25:08.241 --> 25:09.742
I don't want none of that.

25:11.869 --> 25:13.580
What kind of nigga are you?

25:13.663 --> 25:16.583
The kind that doesn't like
being called a nigga.

25:16.666 --> 25:18.126
[Comanche chuckling]

25:20.753 --> 25:23.548
[blows landing]

25:24.549 --> 25:25.883
[inmate] That's it, right there.

25:26.718 --> 25:29.721
- [inmates grunting]
- Yeah, break him up, break him up.

25:32.182 --> 25:33.391
What you got?

25:36.728 --> 25:38.021
[grunting]

25:38.771 --> 25:39.772
Work it.

25:41.816 --> 25:44.194
- You got him now. Lay him up.
- Sending the fights out?

25:44.277 --> 25:46.904
- [grunting]
- Yeah!

25:46.989 --> 25:48.573
Welcome to the Internet.

25:48.656 --> 25:50.033
[inmate] That's how you finish!

25:50.950 --> 25:52.494
Oh, yeah, he ain't gettin' up.

25:55.455 --> 25:58.208
Smart move with the hair.
Nothin' to grab.

25:59.376 --> 26:02.004
I'm still mad at you
for picking Jet Li over Bruce Lee.

26:03.296 --> 26:05.465
Well, take it out on these bastards then.

26:06.383 --> 26:08.093
[chuckles softly]

26:16.268 --> 26:18.270
[grunting]

26:20.438 --> 26:23.316
Keep him off of you.
That's it, right there.

26:26.319 --> 26:27.904
Yeah, there you go.

26:35.412 --> 26:37.330
[Connie screaming]

26:42.252 --> 26:43.378
How's your leg?

26:44.587 --> 26:46.381
Uh, probably broken.

26:48.466 --> 26:49.967
How are you doing this?

26:58.060 --> 26:59.602
[inaudible]

27:03.481 --> 27:05.024
[grunts]

27:16.494 --> 27:17.995
[bones cracking]

27:21.416 --> 27:22.584
[bone crunching]

27:24.461 --> 27:25.628
[yells]

27:36.139 --> 27:37.765
[grunting]

27:45.690 --> 27:48.025
- Get better next time. [chuckles]
- Yeah, yeah.

27:50.695 --> 27:52.364
[Squabbles] See something.
You're changing.

27:53.615 --> 27:56.118
You're not really taking care of yourself.

27:57.285 --> 27:58.953
[Luke] Why?

27:59.036 --> 28:00.997
[Squabbles]
When's the last time you showered?

28:01.080 --> 28:02.749
Or cut your hair?

28:06.378 --> 28:09.046
Just seems like you're spiraling downward.

28:09.131 --> 28:12.217
What I'm doing
ain't got no questions or answers.

28:14.677 --> 28:16.012
Are you losing your way?

28:18.640 --> 28:21.017
When I figure out a way
to cut all this shit loose

28:21.100 --> 28:23.686
and get us out
from under Rackham, I will.

28:23.770 --> 28:24.937
All right.

28:26.273 --> 28:27.482
Widen your stance.

28:28.483 --> 28:31.236
And stay on your line like I told you,
and your chin down.

28:32.028 --> 28:33.905
[suspenseful music playing on TV]

28:52.424 --> 28:54.426
God, Carl. What happened to you?

28:58.930 --> 29:02.099
- Were you attacked?
- I got into a fight or two.

29:04.227 --> 29:06.271
You haven't been to group in months.

29:06.938 --> 29:08.440
Things changed.

29:09.357 --> 29:12.985
So you reverted to your non-verbal self.

29:16.113 --> 29:18.074
Who's the white dude?

29:21.328 --> 29:23.621
The prison doctor, Dr. Burstein.

29:24.872 --> 29:27.292
Do you need to talk to me
about anything?

29:28.335 --> 29:30.837
Reva, when it comes to me,
there's nothing to talk about.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.922
- Squabbles...
- Ain't got shit to say about me.

29:33.005 --> 29:37.302
No, he hasn't said a word about you
no matter how many times I begged him to.

29:37.385 --> 29:41.681
But I could tell by his silence
that you were in a very bad place.

29:41.764 --> 29:42.849
Begging?

29:42.932 --> 29:45.852
I thought I had broken through, Carl.

29:45.935 --> 29:48.188
We had broken through, but you...

29:49.189 --> 29:51.233
Now you just seem broken.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.361
It's not what you think.

29:57.447 --> 29:59.199
It ain't all about me.

30:02.202 --> 30:03.786
Sometimes...

30:06.331 --> 30:08.250
survival costs.

30:19.552 --> 30:21.429
[Shades speaking indistinctly]

30:27.310 --> 30:29.896
[Rackham] Aw, y'all are breaking my heart.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.357
- Hey, hey, hey!
- It's okay.

30:32.440 --> 30:36.653
Remember, you push, I push back harder.

30:36.736 --> 30:38.405
Keeps order, Carl.

30:41.324 --> 30:42.742
Not smart.

30:43.660 --> 30:46.663
Made me realize
there's two folks in here you care for.

30:48.623 --> 30:50.041
[chuckling]

30:59.842 --> 31:03.430
[Scarfe] Plates are blurred.
Closer traffic cam got knocked out.

31:04.221 --> 31:06.223
Damn SUV passed right under it.

31:06.308 --> 31:08.518
That's not enough to go after Cottonmouth.

31:09.436 --> 31:10.562
How about the bomb squad?

31:10.645 --> 31:12.814
Get 'em down to Genghis Connie's
after everything's secure?

31:12.897 --> 31:13.940
[cell phone ringing]

31:14.857 --> 31:16.150
Detective Knight.

31:18.736 --> 31:20.112
[Scarfe] What?

31:20.196 --> 31:22.824
It's that firefighter.
Something's happening.

31:22.907 --> 31:24.409
Okay, thanks.

31:24.492 --> 31:25.827
Go, I got this.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.919
Hey, give me hard copies
of those videos, huh?

31:42.719 --> 31:46.180
Yo, Zip. [sighing]
It's me, Detective Scarfe.

31:47.890 --> 31:49.476
I need to talk to Cottonmouth.

32:13.458 --> 32:17.587
I got to ask you a question...
and I need an honest answer.

32:18.671 --> 32:22.717
You tied to anybody in here?
In a relationship?

32:23.635 --> 32:25.011
Related to anybody?

32:25.094 --> 32:26.888
I work with Dr. Burstein,

32:26.971 --> 32:30.182
but that's to do psych-evals
for the patients he works with.

32:30.266 --> 32:31.768
He's not in the infirmary.

32:32.685 --> 32:34.604
What does he do other than creep around?

32:35.647 --> 32:37.314
He's a legitimate doctor.

32:38.274 --> 32:39.776
Carl, you can trust me.

32:39.859 --> 32:41.277
[breathing heavily]

32:41.361 --> 32:45.156
The guards established a fight ring and
the convicts fight until they're broken.

32:46.533 --> 32:48.951
What happens to them after that,
I don't know.

32:50.412 --> 32:53.748
That's why my face
looks the way it does.

32:55.249 --> 32:58.169
And I may have dragged you
into this bullshit unintentionally.

32:58.252 --> 32:59.837
- Me?
- Yeah.

32:59.921 --> 33:01.673
Rackham's a smart dude.

33:02.590 --> 33:04.341
He knows I like coming here.

33:05.843 --> 33:07.136
Seeing you.

33:08.513 --> 33:10.807
He's going after the people I care about.

33:12.809 --> 33:15.603
Which is why
I need you to stop coming here.

33:15.687 --> 33:17.605
Leave this place and don't look back.

33:17.689 --> 33:20.983
- I'll inform the warden.
- You can't tell anybody shit, Reva.

33:21.067 --> 33:24.612
This setup ain't happened
without the warden being in on it.

33:24.696 --> 33:26.280
You can't trust anybody.

33:26.363 --> 33:29.075
I have worked here for years.
I have to do something.

33:29.158 --> 33:30.952
Leave.

33:31.035 --> 33:33.079
Before this place turns you to salt.

33:41.170 --> 33:44.924
Contact my lawyer.
Tell him I'm ready to talk.

33:45.007 --> 33:46.843
I'll use him to get me
out of this hellhole,

33:46.926 --> 33:48.928
and then I'll take Rackham down myself.

33:49.011 --> 33:51.931
- How long have you been fighting?
- Long enough.

33:54.225 --> 33:57.144
- You didn't know anything about this?
- God... no!

33:59.856 --> 34:04.569
Whenever, wherever... you find me.

34:08.697 --> 34:09.907
Carl.

34:11.576 --> 34:14.036
Why did you come tell me this?

34:17.206 --> 34:19.000
Because you give me hope.

34:26.549 --> 34:28.092
[Squabbles] If you'd have told me sooner,

34:28.175 --> 34:30.678
we probably could've done
something about it,

34:30.762 --> 34:32.472
like take out Rackham.

34:33.429 --> 34:35.558
Someone would take his place.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.476
The hell you gonna do about it?

34:39.853 --> 34:41.813
Stop fighting.

34:41.898 --> 34:44.734
He not gonna let you just
walk away from the fight game.

34:44.817 --> 34:46.193
I know.

34:47.235 --> 34:48.737
I got a plan, though.

34:49.906 --> 34:52.241
I'm gonna build
evidence against Rackham...

34:53.159 --> 34:54.869
then shut his shit down.

34:54.952 --> 34:56.203
[Squabbles sighing]

35:03.460 --> 35:04.962
[exhaling sharply]

35:11.803 --> 35:15.306
Hey, you look a little shook, Squabbles.

35:17.016 --> 35:18.726
What was Lucas talking about?

35:24.649 --> 35:25.983
[razor whirring]

36:01.769 --> 36:03.563
What's up, Carl Lucas?

36:04.981 --> 36:10.570
Yo... you've been owning
those cats in the ring.

36:10.653 --> 36:12.697
It's either that or get owned.

36:17.827 --> 36:19.996
You know one thing I don't believe in?

36:20.830 --> 36:22.414
Coincidences.

36:23.332 --> 36:24.375
What you want?

36:25.292 --> 36:27.128
[Comanche] I hear you tryin'
to get outta the fight game?

36:27.211 --> 36:29.088
Who told you that?

36:29.171 --> 36:30.464
Your girlfriend.

36:32.049 --> 36:34.010
[Shades]
Squabbles didn't give you up easy.

36:36.638 --> 36:39.390
- He alive?
- Ain't the question.

36:40.141 --> 36:41.350
You're right.

36:42.685 --> 36:45.104
Remember what happened
the last time I faced off with you two?

36:45.187 --> 36:46.814
[Comanche] Last time was a test.

36:48.107 --> 36:49.942
Rackham says you don't change your mind...

36:50.026 --> 36:52.444
we give you time
in the infirmary to think about it.

36:52.528 --> 36:54.697
[Shades] See, I'm of the mind
that we stomp your ass.

36:54.781 --> 36:56.991
And find a new dude
to fight for Rackham.

36:58.242 --> 37:01.788
Especially since you trying to expose
some shit that's going on at Seagate.

37:01.871 --> 37:03.497
[chuckling]

37:05.958 --> 37:07.459
[sighing]

37:08.836 --> 37:11.547
I guess I can't trust
nobody around here, can I?

37:12.464 --> 37:14.425
[grunting]

37:49.836 --> 37:51.921
[EKG beeping]

38:05.017 --> 38:06.102
[Burstein] He was attacked.

38:06.185 --> 38:08.730
He's got internal damage.
He won't survive a transfer.

38:10.064 --> 38:11.648
[softly] Oh, Carl.

38:13.317 --> 38:14.526
[sighing]

38:14.610 --> 38:15.987
I trusted you.

38:16.070 --> 38:18.990
[stuttering] It wasn't me.
They beat it out of Squabbles.

38:19.073 --> 38:20.867
They killed him.

38:20.950 --> 38:22.994
[breathing heavily]

38:24.787 --> 38:26.372
[shushing]

38:26.455 --> 38:27.999
[crying]

38:33.170 --> 38:34.630
You have to try to save him.

38:34.714 --> 38:36.465
I've never had a patient
start off in this kind of shape.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.425
- He's damaged goods.
- Do it for me.

38:38.509 --> 38:41.178
- His chances of survival...
- Do it for me.

38:42.263 --> 38:43.514
[sighs]

38:47.518 --> 38:49.061
Take the ferry home.

38:50.229 --> 38:52.564
You don't have to be here for this.

38:52.648 --> 38:53.775
Go.

39:06.996 --> 39:09.957
Yeah, you're probably gonna die.

39:10.958 --> 39:12.794
But you're already dying.

39:13.753 --> 39:19.175
What you're about to see is different
from anything you've ever experienced.

39:34.982 --> 39:36.483
[machine beeps]

39:44.784 --> 39:46.368
[air hissing]

39:51.916 --> 39:53.667
[machine whirring]

40:12.394 --> 40:14.688
- Where's Lucas?
- Albert, this isn't the time.

40:18.525 --> 40:19.902
Why're you trying to save him?

40:19.986 --> 40:22.363
Albert, quit overreacting.

40:22.446 --> 40:24.740
He probably won't survive anyway.

40:25.491 --> 40:29.203
You son of a bitch!
You think you're gonna rat me out?

40:29.286 --> 40:31.247
You're gonna die tonight, Carl.

40:31.330 --> 40:33.207
Albert, please!

40:37.586 --> 40:39.130
We had a good system.

40:40.047 --> 40:43.759
I made money... and you got to live.

40:46.012 --> 40:48.139
Now I need to watch you burn.

40:48.222 --> 40:50.850
- You can't do this.
- Yeah, you gonna stop me?

40:50.933 --> 40:52.726
[machine whirring and hissing]

40:52.809 --> 40:55.229
[rapid beeping]

40:55.312 --> 40:56.813
[alarm blaring]

41:04.738 --> 41:06.532
[screaming]

41:12.246 --> 41:13.956
[screaming]

41:20.546 --> 41:22.924
- [machine exploding]
- [glass shattering]

41:42.359 --> 41:44.403
[Luke grunting and straining]

41:58.667 --> 42:00.711
[breathing deeply]

42:13.557 --> 42:14.976
[clattering]

42:25.777 --> 42:27.571
We're gonna get out of here.

42:27.654 --> 42:29.573
I'm gonna need you to crawl into there.

42:31.700 --> 42:33.744
When and if we get out of here,

42:33.827 --> 42:36.163
you're going to have to explain
how you got this way.

42:37.373 --> 42:38.832
[Connie grunting]

42:41.085 --> 42:42.794
[rubble crumbling]

42:48.342 --> 42:50.177
[coughing]

43:13.909 --> 43:15.536
[alarm blaring]

43:16.953 --> 43:18.330
[exhales sharply]

43:21.708 --> 43:23.710
[screaming]

43:32.511 --> 43:34.346
Sweet Christmas.

43:38.434 --> 43:39.601
[screaming]

43:41.978 --> 43:44.106
- [Misty] What's going on?
- [thudding]

43:46.567 --> 43:49.528
- Back up, newsboy!
- [Misty] Hey, let him through.

43:50.362 --> 43:51.988
Shine your light down here.

43:54.200 --> 43:55.201
[thudding continues]

43:57.703 --> 43:59.913
Damn sure don't know what that is.

44:10.716 --> 44:13.552
- [whistle blowing]
- [yells]

44:15.721 --> 44:17.181
What the hell?

44:17.264 --> 44:19.058
[whistle blowing]

44:23.854 --> 44:25.314
[Luke grunting]

44:29.193 --> 44:31.820
- [firefighter] Can you move?
- I'll be damned.

44:32.863 --> 44:35.699
I can, but I'm gonna need some help.

44:35.782 --> 44:37.784
Connie's leg is broken.

44:37.868 --> 44:39.745
[Connie] I can't believe you did this.

44:41.580 --> 44:43.915
[whispering] Which is why
I think you should keep

44:43.999 --> 44:46.168
what happened down here between us.

44:58.889 --> 45:00.182
[sighing]

45:10.901 --> 45:13.195
You look like a damn fool.

45:16.698 --> 45:18.992
[line ringing]

45:19.075 --> 45:20.952
[woman] <i>Operator.</i>
<i>How can I direct your call?</i>

45:21.036 --> 45:23.914
I'd like to place a collect call
to Dr. Reva Connors.

46:10.211 --> 46:11.628
[chuckling]

46:43.244 --> 46:44.870
[sighs]

46:45.787 --> 46:48.540
I still can't believe
I punched through that wall.

46:50.334 --> 46:53.044
No one's survived
Seagate's waters either.

46:55.672 --> 46:58.216
Did Burstein know
that I would get these...

46:58.300 --> 47:00.218
These abilities?

47:00.302 --> 47:03.805
The bath was only supposed
to heal you at a faster rate.

47:09.102 --> 47:12.356
I can't do anything
that'll let people know who or what I am.

47:14.441 --> 47:17.819
Hell, I don't even know
how I would explain it.

47:25.952 --> 47:27.203
Reva.

47:29.122 --> 47:31.458
When we asked you
about the experiments...

47:32.626 --> 47:34.503
you said they weren't true.

47:37.423 --> 47:38.882
Carl, I...

47:39.800 --> 47:42.093
I promise I'll explain it all.

47:43.178 --> 47:45.263
I'll tell you everything.

47:46.765 --> 47:48.600
How'd you get your hands on all my info?

47:48.684 --> 47:50.852
You haven't always been a convict.

47:50.936 --> 47:53.480
I haven't always been a psychologist.

47:58.652 --> 47:59.778
[sighs]

48:06.952 --> 48:09.663
Thank you for saving my life.

48:11.957 --> 48:13.750
Thank you for changing mine.

48:30.266 --> 48:32.394
You're gonna need a new name.

48:34.355 --> 48:35.897
Any ideas?

48:37.608 --> 48:40.986
[inhaling deeply]
My father's a preacher.

48:45.115 --> 48:47.659
He used to say, one way or the other...

48:48.660 --> 48:51.204
I would regret the life that I led.

48:54.583 --> 48:56.001
He used to say...

48:57.168 --> 49:00.464
"The Spirit of the Lord is on me...

49:00.547 --> 49:05.677
because I have been anointed
to preach good news to the poor.

49:09.055 --> 49:12.601
He has sent me to proclaim
freedom for the prisoners,

49:12.684 --> 49:15.145
and recovery of sight for the blind...

49:16.397 --> 49:18.482
to release the oppressed."

49:20.776 --> 49:22.235
What is that?

49:25.280 --> 49:28.409
Luke 4:18.

49:32.454 --> 49:34.665
He used to tell me that...

49:34.748 --> 49:38.043
no one can cage a man
if he truly wants to be free.

49:39.335 --> 49:42.964
So Luke... Freeman?

49:43.048 --> 49:44.382
Nah.

49:45.383 --> 49:46.677
That's a bit on the nose.

49:46.760 --> 49:48.136
[both chuckling]

49:53.141 --> 49:55.143
[indistinct radio chatter]

50:07.781 --> 50:10.451
- How you doing?
- [inhales deeply]

50:11.367 --> 50:12.536
I'll survive.

50:12.619 --> 50:15.622
[chuckles] That's the understatement
of the year.

50:17.040 --> 50:20.711
Look, we need to, uh,
talk about what happened.

50:21.670 --> 50:23.088
Not now.

50:26.592 --> 50:28.802
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

50:28.885 --> 50:32.639
I've been hearing some pretty miraculous
things about you surviving that explosion.

50:32.723 --> 50:34.140
You saved the owner's life.

50:34.224 --> 50:36.267
Why don't you just tell us your name?

50:46.361 --> 50:48.238
My name is Luke Cage.
