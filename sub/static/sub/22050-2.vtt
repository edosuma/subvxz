WEBVTT

00:02.840 --> 00:05.440
I'll just take it then, Jesus Christ.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.140
What would you guys do without me?

00:10.500 --> 00:15.600
I want 10% of your drugs, and I want
you and your friends to join the <i>kose</i> group.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.960
Yeah just find a seat,
then we can start.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.820
Come outside.

00:28.340 --> 00:32.520
So that's why I was wondering if you wanted
to be in a group with me.

00:32.700 --> 00:37.060
Yeah, I kind of already agreed to
be in a group with...

00:38.940 --> 00:40.980
With...
-Even.

00:59.700 --> 01:02.640
<i>[Hello again.]</i>

01:02.680 --> 01:06.600
<i>[Hi how's it going?]</i>

01:06.620 --> 01:09.520
<i>[Horny, you?]</i>

01:09.520 --> 01:14.120
<i>[Location?]</i>

01:14.680 --> 01:15.740
Look at this guy.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.300
Do you think he's handsome?

01:20.180 --> 01:20.960
This guy.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.840
I don't fucking know.
-Look!

01:26.360 --> 01:27.840
Definitely handsome.

01:28.780 --> 01:32.180
Isak, you can say a guy's handsome without being gay.

01:33.020 --> 01:35.140
I said he's definitely handsome.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.020
I'm going to meet him, you know.

01:39.420 --> 01:43.560
You need my confirmation that he's hot before you meet him?

01:48.020 --> 01:51.800
He writes that he isn't gay, but likes to suck cock for fun.

01:52.240 --> 01:56.140
My boy, you have one year and then you'll be out of the closet.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.920
Eskild, why do you think every guy is gay?

02:02.800 --> 02:06.220
I don't think every guy is gay, Isak.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.240
But I have quite a good gaydar.

02:10.900 --> 02:11.800
You know?

02:11.800 --> 02:16.240
How does this gaydar work?
What's the characteristic of a gay guy?

02:18.820 --> 02:19.640
Okay.

02:20.660 --> 02:25.560
A clue, for example, is when someone
starts talking about sucking dick with a stranger.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.200
Right?

02:33.400 --> 02:36.840
It's also a bit suspicious
when you have a Grindr profile.

02:40.220 --> 02:41.120
Hi!

02:42.200 --> 02:43.000
Noora.

02:45.100 --> 02:46.440
I'm in Isak's room.

02:50.380 --> 02:54.500
No, it's better now. He's cleaned
up a little. However, it smells…

04:09.480 --> 04:12.380
Yo, what's up people?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.700
Straight out of Elvebakken.

04:17.640 --> 04:21.380
Today I'm talking to my best buddy Even.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.520
What's up, bro? Tell us about your movie.

04:24.520 --> 04:30.100
The movie is about Captain America and Vladimir Putin

04:30.520 --> 04:32.380
who are in love with each other.

04:32.640 --> 04:37.800
But they can't be together because
Sarah Palin has bewitched them.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.920
So when they kiss, a cat dies of AIDS.

04:44.460 --> 04:46.840
Who is this Barbie? Sarah Palin?

04:46.840 --> 04:48.920
No! She's just Barbie.

04:49.180 --> 04:50.840
You always have to have a hot woman.

04:51.240 --> 04:55.320
Sarah Palin is considered a hot woman.
-What?!

04:57.400 --> 04:59.860
Who's your favourite director?

05:00.620 --> 05:02.120
Baz Luhrmann.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.680
Seriously?
-Seriously.

05:04.860 --> 05:07.060
Are you kidding me?
-No I'm not kidding you.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.720
Baz Luhrmann?
-Why are you so skeptical?

05:10.260 --> 05:14.160
He makes cliché movies where the leads die.

05:14.160 --> 05:17.360
He makes epic love stories, man!

05:19.140 --> 05:23.720
The lead must die,
otherwise it's not an epic love story.

05:26.880 --> 05:27.760
Hello.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.620
Do you have my stuff?

05:33.900 --> 05:34.820
What stuff?

05:35.740 --> 05:36.780
What stuff?!

05:37.020 --> 05:38.820
I thought you said it wasn't yours.

05:40.620 --> 05:41.760
Can't you just give it to me?

05:45.540 --> 05:47.940
I didn't see your friends at the meeting.

05:48.420 --> 05:51.120
I can't force them to come, can I?!

05:51.560 --> 05:53.780
Control yo hoes, is all that I'm saying.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.960
I can't be bothered with this anymore.
-Neither can I.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.860
Where do you want it?
-You have it?

06:12.380 --> 06:15.060
No! The big compartment.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.480
Sana and Isak! What are you guys doing?

06:25.740 --> 06:28.260
What was it you put in your burqa just now?

06:29.460 --> 06:31.960
My burqa?
-Niqab, then.

06:33.660 --> 06:39.720
Niqab? You can't name the
garment 10% of your students wear?

06:39.720 --> 06:41.000
Are you a racist?

06:42.180 --> 06:44.540
What's it called then?
-It's called a hijab!

06:44.720 --> 06:47.880
Great. Hijab.
But now you guys need to pay attention.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.540
Please, class starts now.

07:08.780 --> 07:10.060
Vilde?

07:10.560 --> 07:11.360
Hi!

07:11.760 --> 07:16.380
I was just thinking, are there
any more <i>kose </i>group meetings?

07:17.300 --> 07:19.780
How unbelievably nice that you're engaging!

07:19.780 --> 07:24.180
We won't have a group meeting this week,
but next week there's the theatre party.

07:24.180 --> 07:26.180
So we'll have a group pre-drink.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.900
Could the pre-drink maybe be at yours?

07:30.180 --> 07:31.200
Why?

07:31.360 --> 07:36.360
Because my mom will host a wine
reception, Eva's house was completely trashed

07:36.380 --> 07:39.480
and Sana's parents are Muslim.
But it could be at yours!

07:41.220 --> 07:43.820
Maybe…
-What's up here?

07:44.300 --> 07:49.060
Isak will throw next week's pre-drink.
Do you guys want to come?

07:50.400 --> 07:52.200
Eh, group pre-drink?

07:52.340 --> 07:54.080
What the fuck…

07:55.340 --> 07:57.960
Why are you laughing?
Do you think the theatre is stupid?

07:58.740 --> 08:04.740
The theatre will lay the social
foundation for how you'll be at school if you engage.

08:04.740 --> 08:08.060
That's where class, age, race, sexual orientation…

08:50.440 --> 08:51.280
Hi!

08:51.560 --> 08:53.000
Did you get my messages?

08:54.800 --> 08:57.880
Sorry. No I didn't get them.

08:59.500 --> 09:05.160
We'll have a pre-drink on Friday.
We were wondering if you guys want to come.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.460
Friday?

09:08.300 --> 09:14.380
I don't really know. I think…
-Isak has brain damage. We're coming.

09:15.780 --> 09:20.000
Okay, yeah. Cool. I'll text you.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.920
What the fuck is your deal?
Are you gay or what?

09:27.880 --> 09:31.900
Where do these first
year girls get the confidence?

09:31.900 --> 09:35.500
Why are first year girls inviting second year guys to a bus pre-drink?

09:35.960 --> 09:39.860
Are they complete noobs?
They're not meant to go after you?

09:40.980 --> 09:43.340
What's the problem with that?

09:43.340 --> 09:45.880
The problem is that there's a system!

09:45.880 --> 09:50.660
If first year girls start sleeping with third
year guys, and second year guys as well...

09:50.660 --> 09:52.220
Who will we sleep with?

09:59.760 --> 10:02.940
I'm available if you want to have sex.

10:06.020 --> 10:07.420
Don't be rude.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.480
Dude, you're such an idiot.
-What the fuck did you mean by that?

10:14.580 --> 10:15.660
Is she playing me, guys?

10:16.740 --> 10:19.100
I'm so damn hungover.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.520
It's Wednesday...

10:25.340 --> 10:26.860
You always have to have a hot woman.

10:27.180 --> 10:31.120
Sarah Palin is considered a hot woman.
-What?!

10:33.900 --> 10:35.940
Who is your favorite director?

10:36.560 --> 10:38.140
Baz Luhrmann.

10:38.660 --> 10:39.680
Seriously?

13:24.300 --> 13:28.080
<i>[Horny?]</i>

13:29.780 --> 13:33.540
<i>[Hi. Top or bottom?]</i>

13:34.540 --> 13:35.920
<i>[Is your cock thick?]</i>

13:35.960 --> 13:37.620
<i>[Squirt a lot?]</i>

13:37.800 --> 13:39.580
<i>[You can fuck and
come in my ass.]</i>

14:29.820 --> 14:31.960
You owe me a drink. Yeah.
-Huh?!

14:31.960 --> 14:35.860
That party Ina and Hedda had together…

14:36.200 --> 14:39.160
… You drank almost all of my six pack.

14:39.160 --> 14:43.220
It's you who owes me.
I gave you like three beers at a party.

14:43.740 --> 14:45.920
That was ages ago!

14:47.760 --> 14:53.840
At that one party you didn't have shit,
and I had a six-pack.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.440
You almost finished the entire fucking six pack.

14:56.440 --> 14:59.320
When I came up to you, you gave me some.

15:02.500 --> 15:06.560
Why are you saying it's true?
-He gets it!

15:07.200 --> 15:08.680
It goes without saying.

15:12.200 --> 15:15.960
Eskild will get it for sure.
-Eksild? Eksild will get it.

15:16.540 --> 15:20.200
Later, guys!
-Text me when we're leaving.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.460
I'll find out.
-Bye!

15:26.440 --> 15:36.180
<i>[Are you home and can you buy beer for me?]</i>

15:48.260 --> 15:51.340
<i>[Sorry, working until 9PM]</i>

15:51.360 --> 15:52.020
Hello.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.080
Hello.

15:58.280 --> 15:59.120
Going home?

15:59.860 --> 16:00.800
Yeah.

16:01.900 --> 16:02.520
You too?

16:16.420 --> 16:17.500
Nice chat...

16:25.000 --> 16:29.500
This is line 12 via Grünerløkka
and Torshov to Disen.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.700
You're 18, right?

16:33.920 --> 16:35.600
Could you maybe buy some beer?

16:46.460 --> 16:49.120
I forgot my ID.
I have to go home and get it.

16:49.120 --> 16:49.880
You coming?

16:59.800 --> 17:00.880
Hello?

17:02.320 --> 17:03.340
Nice.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.500
Don't know where I've put it.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.240
Did you draw these?

17:37.640 --> 17:38.500
Yeah.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.760
They're good.
-Thanks

17:43.420 --> 17:45.900
Really funny.
-You think so?

17:54.100 --> 17:56.600
Here it is.
-You found it?

17:57.160 --> 17:59.100
No, but...

18:02.020 --> 18:05.100
Haven't you skipped school yet?

18:06.520 --> 18:09.640
I just skipped class earlier.

18:09.820 --> 18:13.380
You didn't get caught yet?
I skipped a few hours.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.540
What's the limit?
-The limit is 10 hours.

18:15.540 --> 18:18.400
But if the principal likes you it's 15.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.660
Really?
-Yeah.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.020
But I don't think the principal likes me.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.440
What do you listen to when you listen to music?

18:26.880 --> 18:31.540
I'm quite a big N.W.A. fan.
-That's what gets you going?

18:31.880 --> 18:35.400
That's what you listen to
when you want to feel though.

18:35.620 --> 18:38.580
Have you listened to anything from Nas?

18:39.380 --> 18:40.420
Nas?

18:41.780 --> 18:44.620
Are you kidding?
You haven't checked that out?

18:44.820 --> 18:47.600
I've listened to it. Nas. Nas?
-Nas?

18:47.600 --> 18:50.360
Have you even heard of it?
-I have heard of it!

18:50.360 --> 18:51.940
It doesn't sound like it.

18:54.660 --> 18:56.320
I've heard of it...

18:56.640 --> 18:58.060
You should listen to it later.

19:44.740 --> 19:47.280
That there is a sweaty cheese, man.

19:47.920 --> 19:52.080
I know, I forgot about it
when I went to school today.

19:52.960 --> 19:55.060
It has almost melted.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.800
Has that happened to you before?
-Yeah, I always forget the cheese.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.720
You do that too?
-Yeah.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.340
Fuck, that's a problem.

20:03.500 --> 20:08.580
Cheese and keys. Especially cumin cheese.
(Word play on nøkler = keys, and nøkkel = cumin)

20:08.820 --> 20:11.060
Those are the things I forget most.

20:17.440 --> 20:18.220
Beer?

20:26.280 --> 20:27.520
There you go.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.000
Cheers.
-Cheers.

20:35.660 --> 20:40.140
So, what kind of spices do
you want? Let's start with…

20:40.940 --> 20:48.100
Caribbean Jerk Barbecue.
-Caribbean jerk sounds perfect! Go ahead!

20:48.680 --> 20:52.220
Chili?
-Chili? Always chili.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.080
Rosemary?

20:55.240 --> 20:59.060
Rosemary? Yes, loads.
-Loads of rosemary? Okay.

20:59.060 --> 21:01.060
Let's do this.

21:02.340 --> 21:04.900
Even more?
-No, this is great.

21:10.700 --> 21:15.600
Pottagaldrar? (brand of spice)
-Pottagaldrar? Eh, yes!

21:20.420 --> 21:23.760
<i>[When should we be at Emma's?
Did you get beer? Answer.]</i>

21:23.840 --> 21:28.700
<i>[Hi we'll start the pre-drink at 7PM. Maria lives in Torshov,
just call when you guys are outside the 7-eleven,
I'll come out to meet you. When are you guys coming?]</i>

21:31.320 --> 21:33.780
<i>[My friends are also wondering if you could bring
some of the stuff you gave me in the bathroom
at that party. Only if it isn't much trouble.]</i>

21:33.780 --> 21:34.540
Cinnamon?

21:36.120 --> 21:37.500
Yeah, fuck it!

21:39.580 --> 21:41.640
I think it's gonna taste like balls.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.520
But we can't go back now.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.440
No, we can't go back now.

21:54.020 --> 21:55.700
<i>[Sorry man, Emma and her friends cancelled the
pre-drink soooo I think I'm just gonna chill at home.]</i>

21:55.700 --> 21:57.740
I'll just put a little bit more pepper.
<i>[Sorry man, Emma and her friends cancelled the
pre-drink soooo I think I'm just gonna chill at home.]</i>

21:57.740 --> 22:04.900
<i>[Sorry man, Emma and her friends cancelled the
pre-drink soooo I think I'm just gonna chill at home.]</i>

22:07.800 --> 22:21.860
<i>[Sorry we forgot some other stuff we were doing,
but we'll join another time.]</i>

22:25.660 --> 22:27.000
Should we put it in the oven?

22:28.620 --> 22:30.820
Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

22:35.300 --> 22:38.660
There's something that doesn't taste right in there.
-It's absolutely terrible.

22:39.360 --> 22:41.320
So bad that it was good in a way.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.140
No it was so bad that it was even worse.

22:44.140 --> 22:47.100
It was you who wanted to use all the spices.

22:47.760 --> 22:50.260
A lot of cardamom is essential.

22:51.220 --> 22:55.480
Is that the trick?
For it to be good?

22:56.820 --> 22:59.900
Have you heard rumors about my rapping?
-I actually have.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.220
Come on! Focus!

23:18.100 --> 23:21.080
What time is it?
-Ten to eight.

23:21.280 --> 23:26.360
I've invited a few friends.
But just stay. We have lots of beer.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.480
Hi.
-Introduce yourself.

23:52.120 --> 23:54.280
Hi. Elise. Nice to meet you.
-Isak.

23:55.920 --> 23:59.500
And this here is Sonja. My girlfriend.
-Sonja. Nice to meet you.

23:59.980 --> 24:00.960
Isak.

24:01.720 --> 24:06.200
