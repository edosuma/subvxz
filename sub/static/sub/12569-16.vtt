How convenient for him.

07:36.187 --> 07:39.084

07:33.287 --> 07:39.084
with your visual aid.

07:57.353 --> 08:00.314
in roller skates?

08:00.356 --> 08:01.523
Why?

08:05.986 --> 08:07.321
That's why.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.242
- Okay... Come...
- Whoa...

- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey!

08:18.207 --> 08:19.416
Okay, I know my first question

08:19.417 --> 08:20.625
should be, "Are you hurt?"

08:20.667 --> 08:22.398
But I can't help asking...

08:22.399 --> 08:24.129
Why?

08:26.131 --> 08:27.967
Bryn says at her Swiss

08:27.968 --> 08:29.801
finishing school,

08:26.131 --> 08:29.801
they used to have Disco Days.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.471
She convinced everyone

08:31.472 --> 08:33.097
it would be a fun tradition

08:29.843 --> 08:33.097
to start at Walden.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.099
- Why does Bryn
- get to call all the shots?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.538
I don't know.

08:36.539 --> 08:37.934

08:35.140 --> 08:37.934
seems to like her

08:37.976 --> 08:39.082

08:39.082 --> 08:40.187
to go along with the group.

- What? Why didn't
- you guys tell me?

I'm not so sure about that.

you're starting to like Bryn

better than me.

gonna wear tonight?

that is not true.

that he has not

12:16.487 --> 12:20.240
done a single bit of work...
