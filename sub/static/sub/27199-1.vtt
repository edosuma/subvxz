WEBVTT

00:07.523 --> 00:10.791
Okay, we are
officially on the road!

00:10.793 --> 00:13.227
Whoo!

00:13.229 --> 00:14.628
Jack, is this recording?

00:14.630 --> 00:16.295
Well, check if
the red light's on.

00:16.297 --> 00:17.431
Can't see.

00:17.433 --> 00:18.632
Oh, yeah.

00:18.634 --> 00:20.666
There we go.

00:20.668 --> 00:22.835
We are on our way.
Smile at the camera.

00:22.837 --> 00:24.805
No, not when I'm not driving.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.440
You're such a miserable sod.

00:26.442 --> 00:28.875
We're going on a camping trip.
Be happy!

00:28.877 --> 00:31.844
Yay! Five-and-a-half hours
in a car!

00:31.846 --> 00:33.949
The red letter day
nobody wants!

00:39.287 --> 00:41.488
Aw, look,
all the tents.

00:41.490 --> 00:44.360
Yeah, tents, great.

00:48.896 --> 00:50.931
So here we are.

00:50.933 --> 00:54.767
Everyone's having a lovely time
in their tents.

00:54.769 --> 00:56.937
And this is us.

00:56.939 --> 00:58.938
Yep.

00:58.940 --> 01:02.575
It's literally been
several hours now,

01:02.577 --> 01:04.744
and Jack still hasn't
put up the tent.

01:04.745 --> 01:08.284
Except it hasn't been
several hours, has it?

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074

01:27.002 --> 01:29.369
And as you can see,
we've gone for the...

01:29.371 --> 01:31.837
less-is-more approach
with the tent.

01:31.839 --> 01:34.840
You don't like it, you can go
bunk up with Weirdy-Beardy.

01:35.877 --> 01:37.810
It's fine, darling.

01:37.812 --> 01:41.447
Here's to our romantic
camping weekend!

01:41.449 --> 01:42.715
- Okay.
- Whoo-hoo!

01:42.717 --> 01:44.853
- Ayes ayes ayes.
- Ayes ayes ayes.

01:46.422 --> 01:48.324
Oh, that's disgusting.

01:52.493 --> 01:55.828
Jack, it's what it's all about.
It's beautiful.

01:55.830 --> 01:57.433
You must like this.

01:59.368 --> 02:02.437
We're on private land.
We're probably gonna get shot.

02:06.841 --> 02:08.608
Jack!

02:08.610 --> 02:10.710
- Can't bring your phone with!
- All right, all right!

02:10.711 --> 02:13.347
Jeez!

02:13.349 --> 02:15.585
Two minutes!

02:19.722 --> 02:22.923
Oh! Something
met its end here!

02:22.925 --> 02:25.591
Gill! Gill, come on down
and come and see this!

02:25.593 --> 02:26.992
I'm really sad.

02:26.994 --> 02:29.395
- No!
- No, that's horrible.

02:29.397 --> 02:30.764
You gotta come and see it!

02:30.766 --> 02:33.667
The poor baby had a mom
and a dad and friends.

02:33.669 --> 02:35.634
He probably does.

02:35.636 --> 02:37.372
I'm hungry.
Let's go get some food.

02:41.409 --> 02:45.611
And here she comes, finally!

02:45.613 --> 02:46.947
Jack, give me the camera back.

02:46.949 --> 02:48.948
No! Come on, just catch up!

02:48.950 --> 02:50.516
Jack, don't film me
when I'm tired.

02:50.518 --> 02:52.885
I look awful.

02:52.887 --> 02:55.020
You're the one who wanted
to see the countryside!

02:55.022 --> 02:56.789
Look at it!
Isn't it beautiful?

02:56.791 --> 02:58.093
Don't start.

03:10.938 --> 03:13.573
Babe, can you remember
which way we came?

03:13.575 --> 03:16.675
I think someone's got us lost.

03:16.677 --> 03:19.478
No. This way.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.116
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on.

03:23.152 --> 03:24.520
Okay.

03:28.623 --> 03:30.823
Jack, it's bloody dark now,
and you've gotten us lost,

03:30.825 --> 03:32.626
and I'm freezing.

03:32.628 --> 03:34.997
Give me the camera.
There's a light on it.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.969
Here, get the lantern
from my bag.

03:42.938 --> 03:45.572
Shh, shh, shh!

03:45.574 --> 03:47.807
Oh, my God, what?

03:47.809 --> 03:49.476
You hear that?

03:49.478 --> 03:51.777
Yeah, what is that?

03:51.779 --> 03:53.782
Don't know.
Come on, let's move.

03:59.955 --> 04:01.687
Jack, slow down!

04:01.689 --> 04:03.690
Come on, then.
There's something behind us!

04:05.694 --> 04:06.859
What was it?

04:09.130 --> 04:11.730
Oh, my God, it's still there.
Jack, it's still there!

04:11.732 --> 04:12.835
Come on!

04:24.111 --> 04:25.614
Gillian.

04:26.647 --> 04:29.049
Gilly.

04:29.051 --> 04:31.484
You just left me, you prick!

04:31.486 --> 04:33.556
Shh, shh, shh!

04:35.524 --> 04:37.523
Oh, shit. Jack!

04:42.763 --> 04:45.532
Oh, my God!
Jack!

04:50.972 --> 04:52.808
Oh, my God!

05:10.691 --> 05:12.292
Please, let me in!

05:12.294 --> 05:13.893
Help me, help me!

05:13.895 --> 05:15.996
Oh, are you all right there,
my dear?

05:15.998 --> 05:17.597
Oh, what's going on?

05:17.599 --> 05:20.165
You can't just barge
into my house like this.

05:20.167 --> 05:23.636
I'm so sorry, but there's
something out there.

05:23.638 --> 05:25.104
I think it's just
killed my boyfriend!

05:25.106 --> 05:26.972
Please, I need
to call the police!

05:26.974 --> 05:28.775
Calm down, dear,
no need to worry.

05:28.777 --> 05:30.143
You're safe now.

05:30.145 --> 05:31.611
No, you don't understand.

05:31.613 --> 05:34.047
I need to call the police!
It just...

05:34.049 --> 05:36.181
It just grabbed him
like he was a piece of meat!

05:36.183 --> 05:38.018
What grabbed him?

05:38.020 --> 05:40.020
I don't know!

05:40.022 --> 05:43.256
It was huge!
Oh, my God, Jack!

05:43.258 --> 05:46.993
Oh, oh, you poor thing!
You're shaking!

05:46.995 --> 05:48.895
Come on, let's get you
in the kitchen,

05:48.897 --> 05:51.297
sit you down and get you
a nice cup of tea.

05:51.299 --> 05:53.333
No, I just need to call
the police, please!

05:53.335 --> 05:55.969
That's all right, dear.
The phone's in the kitchen.

05:55.971 --> 05:57.807
Come this way.

06:01.642 --> 06:03.012
This way, my dear.

06:10.786 --> 06:12.885
Take a seat with my boys.

06:12.887 --> 06:15.190
Just popping the kettle on.

06:18.993 --> 06:22.128
We don't often get visitors,
do we, boys?

06:32.039 --> 06:35.075
Don't worry.
They won't bite you.

06:35.077 --> 06:36.710
Do you take sugar?

06:36.712 --> 06:39.813
Um, just milk.

06:39.815 --> 06:42.782
Wait, did you say you had
a phone that I could use?

06:42.784 --> 06:45.885
Oh, yes, sorry, dear.
There's me being mother.

06:45.887 --> 06:49.325
Two seconds, my lovely.
I'll be right back.

06:51.859 --> 06:54.760
Phone, phone,
now where did I put it?

06:57.099 --> 06:59.969
So, um, how long have
you guys lived here...

07:00.969 --> 07:02.238
Oh!

07:05.674 --> 07:07.342
Grub's up, boys!

07:23.058 --> 07:24.694
Charlie!

07:28.296 --> 07:30.266
Dinner time!

07:40.308 --> 07:42.211
That's my boy.

07:46.214 --> 07:47.946
♪ Carpets make your day ♪

07:47.948 --> 07:50.150
♪ We're dashing
through the lake ♪

07:51.820 --> 07:53.389
You fucking prick!

07:58.260 --> 07:59.395
Dad!

08:06.702 --> 08:09.001
- What is it?
- Phone for ya.

08:09.003 --> 08:10.335
Already?

08:10.337 --> 08:12.337
Only just opened.

08:12.339 --> 08:13.338
Who is it?

08:13.340 --> 08:14.873
I don't know.

08:14.875 --> 08:18.078
- Who is it?
- Hey! Give it here.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.713
Go and make us a cuppa.

08:20.715 --> 08:22.748
Hello?

08:22.750 --> 08:25.984
Oh, hello there, Mrs. Hanning.

08:25.986 --> 08:29.823
Yes, I've got my best team
heading out to you.

08:29.825 --> 08:31.224
Do not worry.

08:31.226 --> 08:34.094
They're literally
loading up now, okay?

08:34.096 --> 08:37.096
Lovely. If you have
any problems,

08:37.097 --> 08:39.832
just give me a call, okay?

08:39.833 --> 08:42.203
Thanks. Bye!

08:45.406 --> 08:46.906
Morning, all.

08:46.908 --> 08:48.307
Chris.

08:48.309 --> 08:50.744
Ah, Christopher.

08:50.746 --> 08:54.814
It seems your alarm clock
is 10 minutes out of sync again.

08:54.816 --> 08:57.282
You really need
to look into that.

08:57.284 --> 08:58.350
All right.

08:58.352 --> 09:01.488
I had a... late night.

09:01.490 --> 09:04.090
Ugh. Too much information.

09:04.092 --> 09:07.127
I can't hear
that kettle boiling, Jade.

09:10.231 --> 09:12.264
Oh, yeah, make us a brew.

09:12.266 --> 09:15.301
Gosh, as if I'm not
busy enough!

09:15.303 --> 09:18.838
- Tash in?
- She's out back loading up.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.541
Yes, and can you go
and help her, please?

09:21.543 --> 09:23.877
It's a big job today.

09:23.879 --> 09:26.345
All right, Nige.
God, I ain't even had a tea yet.

09:26.347 --> 09:28.248
Remember to make up
for those 10 minutes

09:28.250 --> 09:30.849
during your lunch as well.

09:30.851 --> 09:32.387
Yeah, whatever.

09:39.394 --> 09:40.830
Tash!

09:42.831 --> 09:44.397
Heads up!

09:44.399 --> 09:45.931
Come on, watch the hair!

09:45.933 --> 09:47.801
You vain sod.

09:47.803 --> 09:50.069
Anyway, you're late, as always.

09:50.071 --> 09:51.503
I had a bit of late one.

09:51.505 --> 09:53.473
You know what I'm like
when I hit the sambucus.

09:53.475 --> 09:55.941
Stop, stop.
I don't care.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.476
Just get that on the van.

09:57.478 --> 09:59.311
All right, chill out.
What's the job?

09:59.313 --> 10:01.947
Some old country house
apparently,

10:01.949 --> 10:03.582
in the middle of nowhere.

10:03.584 --> 10:05.754
A big country house.

10:07.021 --> 10:09.288
And here's your paperwork.

10:09.290 --> 10:11.191
Have you got enough
gripper on the van?

10:11.193 --> 10:12.358
Yes.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.593
And underlay?

10:13.595 --> 10:15.128
Yes, Nige.

10:15.130 --> 10:17.297
Okay, just checking.

10:17.299 --> 10:19.367
It's a good job for us,
this one.

10:21.535 --> 10:23.371
Behave yourself, please.

10:26.908 --> 10:28.340
Hold on, a full house?

10:28.342 --> 10:30.276
Just you and me?
That's bullshit.

10:30.278 --> 10:33.278
Don't worry. Your best mates
Dean and Colin will be there.

10:33.280 --> 10:34.980
Great.

10:34.982 --> 10:37.182
I think I prefer
just us doing it.

10:37.184 --> 10:38.853
Where are they now, then?

10:40.388 --> 10:42.589
Don't do it.

10:42.591 --> 10:44.858
Colin, don't do it.

10:44.860 --> 10:46.392
What?

10:46.394 --> 10:47.960
You gonna hit a pipe.

10:47.962 --> 10:49.494
I'm not gonna hit a pipe.

10:49.496 --> 10:52.364
I am telling you now
you're gonna go hit a pipe.

10:52.366 --> 10:54.334
I'm not going to hit
a bloody pipe.

10:54.336 --> 10:56.436
How long do you think
I've been doing this job?

10:56.438 --> 10:59.439
All right. Go on, then.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.240
Oh, you didn't lay
the wrong way around.

11:01.242 --> 11:03.176
Oh, for God's sake,
will you shut up?

11:03.178 --> 11:04.509
I don't see you
down here doing it.

11:04.511 --> 11:07.213
And how am I supposed to
fit down there with you?

11:07.215 --> 11:09.548
And what's that
supposed to mean?

11:14.422 --> 11:16.258
See? Told ya.

11:19.494 --> 11:21.494
She ain't happy.

11:21.496 --> 11:23.562
Listen, Nige, it's fine.
She's all right with it.

11:23.564 --> 11:25.931
And we told her
these things happen.

11:25.933 --> 11:29.636
What? Well, of course I rang
the plumber, yeah, yeah.

11:29.638 --> 11:31.403
Hey, hold on a minute.

11:31.405 --> 11:33.605
Well, Malcolm has
just turned up now.

11:33.607 --> 11:37.176
Yeah. I know, big house,
big job, big money, I get it.

11:37.178 --> 11:39.244
Don't panic, all right?

11:39.246 --> 11:41.648
We'll start loading up the van,
and we'll head out there.

11:41.650 --> 11:44.517
All right, okay.
Okay, okeydokey.

11:44.519 --> 11:46.619
Cheese. Bye, Nige.
Bye. Bye.

11:46.621 --> 11:49.388
He never bloody stops him.

11:49.390 --> 11:51.356
- Morning, fellas.
- Malcolm.

11:51.358 --> 11:54.259
Oh, finally showed up now
we've finished the job.

11:54.261 --> 11:55.628
Where's your car?

11:55.630 --> 11:58.230
Oh, yeah, sorry, man.
I sorta lost it.

11:58.232 --> 12:00.066
- You lost your car?
- Didn't mean to.

12:00.068 --> 12:01.566
I had a late night one,
you know?

12:01.568 --> 12:03.268
Hey, I got home okay,
though, didn't I?

12:03.270 --> 12:06.205
How did you lose it?
I shouldn't even ask.

12:06.207 --> 12:07.706
Can't remember.

12:07.708 --> 12:09.709
Oh, well, these things turn up.
They always do.

12:09.711 --> 12:11.476
You see, they don't,
though, Malcolm.

12:11.478 --> 12:13.946
Your car keys maybe,
but a little Fiat Punto

12:13.948 --> 12:15.480
ain't gonna turn up
on your windowsill, is it?

12:15.482 --> 12:17.450
Oh, well, luckily,
I left the keys in the car,

12:17.452 --> 12:21.287
so at least I'll get them back
at the same time.

12:21.289 --> 12:23.355
Don't worry. He's just in a mood
'cause he's weed himself.

12:23.357 --> 12:25.325
Oh, right, yeah, cool.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.125
Overactive bladder syndrome.

12:27.127 --> 12:28.628
That is common when you
get to, like, your 50s.

12:28.630 --> 12:30.430
- My nan had it.
- Shut it, Malcolm.

12:30.432 --> 12:31.730
I'm not even 50.

12:31.732 --> 12:33.432
Lob your bike in the van
and get in.

12:33.434 --> 12:35.200
- Where we going now, then?
- Gonna go meet Tash.

12:35.202 --> 12:37.570
Your favorite, hey?
Whoa, what you doing?

12:37.572 --> 12:39.471
You in the back as well, mate.

12:39.473 --> 12:41.173
Isn't that illegal,
me in the back?

12:41.175 --> 12:42.542
Not if you keep your head down.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.109
Why can't I sit up there
with you two?

12:44.111 --> 12:45.610
Malcolm, apprentices
have to sit in the back.

12:45.612 --> 12:48.181
We've been through this.
It's a rite of passage.

12:48.183 --> 12:49.481
All right, then.

12:49.483 --> 12:52.120
You say we're
meeting Tash, yeah?

13:04.432 --> 13:06.766
Wow. Can really smell the shit
in the air around here.

13:14.174 --> 13:17.509
Aw, Craig's a player, man.
Top lad.

13:17.511 --> 13:19.711
Some funny shit!

13:19.713 --> 13:21.647
What are you doing?

13:21.649 --> 13:25.118
Craig sent me some pics
from last night. Look.

13:25.120 --> 13:28.220
Don't you think my arms
look big in that shirt?

13:28.222 --> 13:31.423
Is that Malcolm
in the background?

13:31.425 --> 13:33.426
Is it?

13:33.428 --> 13:35.194
Don't remember seeing him out.

13:35.196 --> 13:37.629
Look, forget your phone.
Can you help me fix the satnav?

13:37.631 --> 13:39.798
Chill out!

13:41.602 --> 13:43.603
Look, it's broken anyway.
I told you that last time.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.604
What you reckon,
new profile pic?

13:45.606 --> 13:48.074
Just forget your phone.

13:48.076 --> 13:49.341
Just find directions.

13:49.343 --> 13:51.212
I'll just ring Nige
and ask him.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.516
This one here?

13:56.518 --> 13:59.118
Oh, so lovely, so soft.

14:02.656 --> 14:04.657
Feel your feet on that.

14:10.465 --> 14:12.101
Phone, Jade!

14:13.534 --> 14:15.334
Don't be shy.
Take your shoes off.

14:15.336 --> 14:17.402
Cupid Carpets.
Jade speaking.

14:17.404 --> 14:19.739
Dad! Phone!

14:19.741 --> 14:21.706
Perfect color for
this time of year as well.

14:21.708 --> 14:24.543
Who is it?

14:24.545 --> 14:26.515
Who is it?

14:28.449 --> 14:30.649
It's Chris!

14:31.685 --> 14:34.122
Excuse me one second.

14:42.563 --> 14:44.599
Don't let them leave.

14:48.535 --> 14:50.472
Yes, hello?

14:51.739 --> 14:54.706
The postcode is
on the paperwork.

14:54.708 --> 14:56.676
What?

14:56.678 --> 15:00.245
Well, use a satnav.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.516
Who broke it?

15:03.217 --> 15:04.385
Sorry, mate.

15:11.693 --> 15:14.226
You guys not been
to this place before, no?

15:14.228 --> 15:16.295
No, Malcolm, otherwise
I wouldn't be working out

15:16.297 --> 15:19.465
Nigel's useless directions,
would I?

15:19.467 --> 15:21.334
When did you start
smoking, then?

15:21.336 --> 15:23.136
Me? Oh, few years now.

15:24.338 --> 15:26.239
- Want one?
- No, thanks.

15:26.241 --> 15:28.306
I don't think you're gonna
impress Tasha with all that.

15:28.308 --> 15:29.441
You know, she's a health freak.

15:29.443 --> 15:30.909
Really?

15:30.911 --> 15:32.711
Don't even know why I started,
to be honest.

15:32.713 --> 15:34.580
Only started last week.
I think it's just a case of...

15:34.582 --> 15:36.481
You're rambling again.

15:36.483 --> 15:39.551
Aw, I just dripped egg
all over the roadmap.

15:39.553 --> 15:41.354
You're an animal.

15:41.356 --> 15:43.189
Haven't you chaps ever thought
about using one of those

15:43.191 --> 15:45.191
satellite navigation thingies?

15:45.193 --> 15:46.758
- I don't trust them.
- Why?

15:46.760 --> 15:47.859
I just don't.

15:47.861 --> 15:49.528
Tell him why.

15:49.530 --> 15:51.497
Because they're
not always right.

15:51.499 --> 15:54.167
Or because some people follow
every instruction blindly,

15:54.169 --> 15:56.168
even if it means
driving into a fence.

15:56.170 --> 15:58.237
Well, it said turn right,
didn't it?

15:58.239 --> 16:00.705
How many times did I say
you're going the wrong way, Col?

16:00.707 --> 16:02.407
Oh, look, there's a fence, Col.

16:02.409 --> 16:03.676
We're going to crash, Colin.

16:03.678 --> 16:06.345
- Is that true?
- He's lying again.

16:06.347 --> 16:08.480
Oh, I'm lying, am I?
Let's go and ask the poor family

16:08.482 --> 16:10.615
having their kid's birthday
party in the garden, shall we?

16:10.617 --> 16:12.284
Ask them if I'm lying.

16:12.286 --> 16:14.653
Oh, he's over-exaggerating
it a bit.

16:14.655 --> 16:16.855
Anyway, shouldn't we be
getting a move on, fellas?

16:16.857 --> 16:19.492
Malcolm, you know the score.
The quicker we get there,

16:19.494 --> 16:21.326
the more work
we're gonna have to do.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.498
Chill out, they'll be fine.

16:29.670 --> 16:32.470
When he said "big,"
I didn't think this kind of big.

16:32.472 --> 16:33.839
Well done, Nige.

16:33.841 --> 16:36.209
Can see why he wanted
all of us here.

16:36.211 --> 16:37.880
Fucking great.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.757
Enjoy the pie, boys.

16:54.728 --> 16:56.662
All I'm saying is
I just either prefer

16:56.664 --> 17:00.566
working on my own or with you
'cause the others do my head in.

17:00.568 --> 17:01.767
Hello.

17:01.769 --> 17:03.936
- Hi. Mrs. Hanning, is it?
- Yes.

17:03.938 --> 17:07.339
- We're from Cupid Carpets.
- Oh, the carpet people!

17:07.342 --> 17:08.674
Do come in, do come in.

17:08.675 --> 17:09.778
Thank you.

17:11.746 --> 17:14.780
Ooh, you're a strong man,
aren't you?

17:14.781 --> 17:16.415
The job keeps me fit.

17:16.416 --> 17:19.784
I bet it does.
I bet it does.

17:19.786 --> 17:21.786
Just follow me.

17:21.788 --> 17:24.888
Do you want me
to show you around or...

17:24.891 --> 17:26.657
You show us
where the living room is,

17:26.660 --> 17:28.394
we can set up in there,
if you like.

17:28.396 --> 17:31.496
Okay, my dears,
this way, then.

17:31.498 --> 17:33.666
It's nice and quiet
around here, isn't it?

17:33.668 --> 17:36.572
Yes. Just the way
I like it.

17:38.773 --> 17:40.872
This is the living room.

17:40.874 --> 17:42.875
It should be
no problem at all.

17:42.877 --> 17:44.877
We don't use it much anymore.

17:44.879 --> 17:47.679
We've got so many other rooms.

17:47.681 --> 17:50.382
Jeez, look at this fella.

17:50.384 --> 17:52.618
Could be from that film.
What's it called?

17:52.620 --> 17:55.588
That's an old relative
of mine, my dear.

17:55.590 --> 17:57.326
Quite a family heirloom, that.

17:59.660 --> 18:03.928
We managed to move
most of the furniture for you.

18:03.930 --> 18:05.298
On your own?

18:05.300 --> 18:07.766
My boys helped me.

18:07.768 --> 18:10.069
We got rid of all
the old carpets as well.

18:10.071 --> 18:12.538
I know that can be a pain.

18:12.540 --> 18:13.673
Yeah, you wouldn't
believe what your carpets

18:13.675 --> 18:14.907
will pick up over the years.

18:14.909 --> 18:17.709
No, I can imagine.

18:17.711 --> 18:19.645
Can I get you a cup of tea
or anything?

18:19.647 --> 18:22.514
Oh, yeah, tea would be great,
thanks. No sugar.

18:22.516 --> 18:24.750
One tea, no sugar.
And you, my dear?

18:24.752 --> 18:26.484
Oh, no, I'm fine, thank you.

18:26.486 --> 18:30.625
All right, well, give me a shout
if you change your mind.

18:32.959 --> 18:34.694
- Seriously?
- What?

18:34.696 --> 18:36.494
Well, no wonder she lives
all the way out here

18:36.496 --> 18:37.963
'cause her family's well ugly.

18:37.965 --> 18:39.932
You need to watch your mouth.

18:39.934 --> 18:42.801
I speak to the customers,
not you, simple.

18:42.803 --> 18:44.637
Okay, okay, calm down.

18:44.639 --> 18:47.005
Just making conversation.

18:47.007 --> 18:49.542
Bet this place is haunted
or something.

18:49.544 --> 18:51.510
If you believe in that crap.

18:51.512 --> 18:54.383
You could make a proper good
horror film here, though.

18:56.117 --> 18:59.685
They were just some
ordinary carpet fitters.

18:59.687 --> 19:02.420
She was a sweet old lady
that lived in some crap hole

19:02.422 --> 19:04.055
in the middle of nowhere.

19:04.057 --> 19:06.058
Are you actually gonna
do some work today?

19:06.060 --> 19:08.394
Why don't you get that stuff
off the van?

19:08.396 --> 19:10.795
- Well, what you gonna do?
- Prep upstairs.

19:10.797 --> 19:12.630
Well, the others better hurry up

19:12.632 --> 19:14.702
'cause I ain't doing all this
on my own.

19:16.737 --> 19:17.969

You're doing my head in,
giving me a headache.

19:34.155 --> 19:36.021
- I was getting into it.
- Yeah, I noticed.

19:36.023 --> 19:38.390
Don't give up the day job
whatever you do.

19:38.392 --> 19:40.993
Oh, sorry, Col!

19:42.130 --> 19:44.096
What's wrong with you today?

19:44.098 --> 19:45.898
Nothing. What do you mean?

19:45.900 --> 19:49.435
You're a miserable bastard,
that's what I mean.

19:49.437 --> 19:50.770
She's leaving me, Dean.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.036
Who is?

19:52.038 --> 19:54.639
Carol, my wife!

19:54.641 --> 19:56.442
Jesus, you've met her
at every Christmas doo

19:56.444 --> 19:57.810
for the last five years!

19:57.812 --> 20:00.413
Yeah, I know who Carol is.

20:00.415 --> 20:03.581
Do you wanna talk about it?

20:03.583 --> 20:05.484
No, not really.

20:05.486 --> 20:06.718
All right.

20:06.720 --> 20:08.154
Well, actually,
if you must know,

20:08.156 --> 20:10.523
she says I've become boring
and predictable,

20:10.525 --> 20:12.157
and I'm just not
spontaneous anymore.

20:12.159 --> 20:14.459
I mean, me,
not spontaneous?

20:14.461 --> 20:16.428
I get fish and chips for dinner
every Friday night,

20:16.430 --> 20:17.929
ungrateful bitch!

20:17.931 --> 20:20.468
You let it out, mate.
Better if we pull over, eh?

20:26.474 --> 20:29.942
I mean, how am I suppose
to fit it all in?

20:29.944 --> 20:32.945
I'm trying to pay for
the patio she's always wanted.

20:32.947 --> 20:36.815
That's why I work
the extra overtime.

20:36.817 --> 20:38.617
No, I'm not silly,
I know I might have

20:38.619 --> 20:40.051
put on a few pounds
since the '80s,

20:40.053 --> 20:42.987
but we've all changed
since then.

20:42.989 --> 20:45.457
I mean, she ain't exactly
Bonnie fucking Tyler.

20:45.459 --> 20:48.226
- You know what I mean?
- Sure, mate.

20:48.228 --> 20:50.795
I mean, I try and do
the right thing, settle down,

20:50.797 --> 20:54.800
get a secure job,
get married, have kids,

20:54.802 --> 20:57.869
and this is what I get for it.

20:57.871 --> 20:59.504
It's a joke, Dean,
it's a joke.

20:59.506 --> 21:00.505
I'm a joke!

21:00.507 --> 21:02.073
Right, listen to me now.

21:02.075 --> 21:05.778
You are not a joke,
so pull yourself together.

21:05.780 --> 21:07.713
You are Colin the carpet fitter,

21:07.715 --> 21:09.814
and the best carpet fitter
I know.

21:09.816 --> 21:12.083
And carpet fitters don't cry,
do they?

21:12.085 --> 21:14.052
Hey?

21:14.054 --> 21:16.591
No. So who are ya?

21:18.692 --> 21:20.493
Colin the carpet fitter.

21:20.495 --> 21:23.262
That's right, and what don't
carpet fitters do?

21:23.264 --> 21:24.730
Carpet fitters don't cry.

21:24.732 --> 21:26.564
Exactly, and what are we
gonna do now?

21:26.566 --> 21:27.933
Go fit some carpet.

21:27.935 --> 21:29.738
Good. Come on, then.

21:31.706 --> 21:34.005
- Sorry about that, mate.
- It's all right, mate.

21:34.007 --> 21:35.741
You know where
you're going, yeah?

21:35.743 --> 21:38.878
I think so, I think so.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.679
Just a case of staying positive.

21:41.681 --> 21:45.453
No, I mean, you know
where you're driving to?

22:00.001 --> 22:01.934
Here you are, my lovely.

22:01.936 --> 22:03.903
Ah, thanks, love.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.204

Tash!

23:36.630 --> 23:38.030
I'm ready to fit
down here now!

23:38.032 --> 23:40.735
Shall we get the carpets
off the van?!

Tash?!

23:45.939 --> 23:47.708
Fucking deaf, man!

23:52.213 --> 23:54.213
Weird.

23:54.215 --> 23:56.115
Hello!

23:56.117 --> 23:59.318
I can't seem to open
this door!

23:59.320 --> 24:00.819
Hello!

24:00.821 --> 24:02.821
Old lady!

24:02.823 --> 24:04.292
Anyone!

24:10.296 --> 24:11.900
Hey, little fella.

24:16.036 --> 24:18.870
Hey, look,
take it easy, mate.

24:18.872 --> 24:20.874
Look, I don't know
what you want, but...

24:32.319 --> 24:33.388
Chris?

25:09.957 --> 25:12.393
My fucking nose.

25:29.944 --> 25:31.312
Sorry, Tash.

25:41.221 --> 25:42.323
Fuck!

26:07.046 --> 26:08.348
Fuck!

26:52.592 --> 26:55.226
Boys! Boys!

26:55.228 --> 26:56.864
Stop it now!

27:09.376 --> 27:12.046
Now let's get this stuff
cleaned up!

30:02.749 --> 30:05.082
William.

30:05.084 --> 30:09.487
What have you done to my boy?

30:09.489 --> 30:11.191
Don't come any closer.

30:13.427 --> 30:15.663
I mean it!

30:39.152 --> 30:40.752
Charlie!

30:40.754 --> 30:43.388
Dinner time!

30:56.402 --> 31:00.107
Boys! Come and help me
clean this mess up!

31:23.530 --> 31:24.632
Hello?

32:30.697 --> 32:34.198
Nice work, boys.
Let's get this grub sold,

32:34.200 --> 32:37.601
and then I'm gonna treat us all
to a lovely lunch.

33:10.637 --> 33:12.637
Tell you what.
I'm glad I'm here.

33:12.639 --> 33:13.871
I'm dying for a leak.

33:13.873 --> 33:16.510
Oh, lovely.
Grab the tools, then.

33:19.746 --> 33:22.680
Come on, then.

33:22.682 --> 33:26.219
- What was he crying about?
- Oh, mate, leave it.

33:34.695 --> 33:37.329
- Hello!
- We at the right house?

33:37.331 --> 33:39.697
Oh, I hope so 'cause there's
nothing else around here.

33:39.699 --> 33:41.565
- But where's the van?
- What van?

33:41.567 --> 33:43.234
The other work van.

33:43.236 --> 33:45.669
Chris and Tash are supposed
to be here already.

33:45.671 --> 33:48.673
Maybe they parked in the back,
skiving or something.

33:48.675 --> 33:51.412
Someone better be in.
I'm gagging for a piss now.

33:55.849 --> 33:57.648
Look, that's our underlay
in there.

33:57.650 --> 33:59.818
Where?

33:59.820 --> 34:02.253
Well, where they gone, then?

34:02.255 --> 34:03.722
Chris!

34:03.724 --> 34:06.023
Tasha!

34:06.025 --> 34:08.396
Come on, let's have a nose
around the back.

34:10.362 --> 34:13.967
Malcolm, you stay there.
Beep the horn if anyone comes.

34:23.643 --> 34:25.309
Whoa.

34:25.311 --> 34:27.012
I tell you what, mate,

34:27.014 --> 34:29.513
I wouldn't mind a place
like this when I'm older.

34:29.514 --> 34:32.449
Yeah, Carol always wanted me
to move out to the sticks.

34:32.452 --> 34:34.455
Hey, Col, it's opened, mate.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.733
Hello!

34:48.735 --> 34:50.768
It's the carpet fitters!

34:50.771 --> 34:52.406
Anyone home?

34:53.873 --> 34:55.072
Well, I don't know.

34:55.074 --> 34:56.706
Right, I'm going for a piss.

34:56.708 --> 34:58.343
No, you're bloody not!

34:58.345 --> 35:00.010
Dean! Dean!

35:00.012 --> 35:02.646
Mate, I can't hold it.
Two minutes.

35:02.648 --> 35:04.985
That's not very professional!

37:16.148 --> 37:18.017
Oh, finally.

37:19.718 --> 37:21.856
What's the matter with you?

37:23.756 --> 37:24.789
Fingers.

37:24.791 --> 37:26.024
What?

37:26.026 --> 37:28.526
There were some fingers
in the toilet.

37:28.528 --> 37:31.762
What you talking about?

37:31.764 --> 37:36.800
I just saw two human fingers
floating about willy-nilly.

37:36.802 --> 37:40.637
Not a turd or anything normal.
Fingers.

37:40.639 --> 37:42.673
Your eyes are
playing tricks on ya.

37:42.675 --> 37:45.609
You need to get
some glasses, mate.

37:45.611 --> 37:46.744
What you eating?

37:46.746 --> 37:50.013
Little slice of this pie.

37:50.015 --> 37:52.182
Chicken, I think.

37:52.184 --> 37:54.218
Spit it out.

37:54.220 --> 37:56.120
You just used the toilet
without asking.

37:56.122 --> 37:57.655
Hardly think
they're gonna notice

37:57.657 --> 38:00.024
a little sliver of pie
missing.

38:00.026 --> 38:02.526
There's a nipple in the pie.

38:02.528 --> 38:04.162
A what?

38:04.164 --> 38:08.669
There is a human nipple
in the pie.

39:39.892 --> 39:41.160
Hello?

39:59.211 --> 40:01.745
Yeah, yeah, sure, Nige.

40:01.747 --> 40:03.347
Yeah, sure.

40:03.349 --> 40:08.555
Landing, stairs, hallway.
Yeah, no worries, mate, yeah.

40:15.061 --> 40:19.030
Well, I can fit that
for you on...

40:19.032 --> 40:20.664
on Tuesday.

40:20.666 --> 40:22.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:28.807 --> 40:31.075
No way.

40:31.077 --> 40:34.245
Bloody hell, Col,
there's toes in this as well!

40:34.247 --> 40:37.180
Get me a bloody towel.

40:37.182 --> 40:39.352
Do you reckon you just eat
a bit of Chris or something?

40:52.898 --> 40:55.835
Hello?
Is someone there?

40:56.869 --> 40:58.369
Malcolm?

40:58.371 --> 41:00.937
Tasha, what the bloody hell
you doing down there?

41:00.939 --> 41:04.378
No time. Help me get
these doors open now.

41:07.012 --> 41:08.912
This is a wind-up, innit?

41:08.914 --> 41:11.182
What was that?

41:11.184 --> 41:13.017
Just get me the fuck
out of here.

41:13.019 --> 41:15.452
All right, all right.

41:15.454 --> 41:18.055
Lads! Lads!

41:18.057 --> 41:19.923
Oh, it won't open!

41:19.925 --> 41:22.061
- Just do something, quick!
- All right!

41:25.030 --> 41:26.798
I've got an idea!

41:30.169 --> 41:32.035
I knew that meat was funny.

41:32.037 --> 41:34.338
Now do you believe me about
the fingers in the toilet?

41:34.340 --> 41:36.340
What you think is going on?

41:36.342 --> 41:37.977
I don't even want to say it.

41:51.890 --> 41:53.026
Malcolm!

41:58.997 --> 42:01.466
- What are you doing?
- Please hurry up!

42:01.468 --> 42:03.434
- Is that someone down there?
- Oh, my God!

42:03.436 --> 42:05.503
This is like
that Pretzel bloke!

42:05.505 --> 42:07.137
It's Fritzl, you idiot.

42:07.139 --> 42:08.271
It's Tasha!

42:08.273 --> 42:10.941
Get me the fuck out of here.

42:10.943 --> 42:12.012
Give me that!

42:13.512 --> 42:14.781
Come on!

42:28.794 --> 42:30.160
Oh, shit.

42:30.162 --> 42:32.265
Get these fucking doors
open now!

42:35.434 --> 42:37.403
- Are you all right?
- Tasha!

42:41.441 --> 42:45.475
What is going on?!

42:45.477 --> 42:48.278
- And what the fuck was that?
- Let's go!

42:48.280 --> 42:51.017
Yeah!

42:55.320 --> 42:57.888
- Malcolm!
- Oh, shit. Sorry!

43:00.526 --> 43:01.928
Go, go!

43:10.903 --> 43:13.037
- Oh, bollocks!
- What now?

43:13.039 --> 43:14.405
You left my toolbox
in the kitchen.

43:14.407 --> 43:15.972
Is that really important?

43:15.974 --> 43:18.142
Well, they're my own tools.
Expensive.

43:18.144 --> 43:19.876
Carol bought me most of them.

43:19.878 --> 43:22.113
Oh, fair enough, then, mate.
Wanna nip in and get them?

43:22.115 --> 43:24.481
We'll just wait out here and
see if we get killed or not!

43:24.483 --> 43:27.818
Jesus. I'm gonna buy you
a new fucking toolbox.

43:27.820 --> 43:29.586
Can we just get out of here?

43:31.957 --> 43:33.226
Tasha!

43:38.965 --> 43:40.965
Dean, we're in trouble, mate!

43:43.001 --> 43:44.367
What you want to do?

43:44.369 --> 43:46.169
Uh, hide!

43:46.171 --> 43:49.372
They've already seen you,
you wolly!

43:49.374 --> 43:50.408
Come on!

43:50.410 --> 43:52.008
Guys?

43:52.010 --> 43:53.412
Is everything all right?

43:55.081 --> 43:57.113
What is going on?

43:57.115 --> 43:59.950
Malcolm, stay in there.
He ain't see ya.

43:59.952 --> 44:02.954
- What are we gonna do?
- We can make a run for it.

44:02.956 --> 44:04.158
Ready?

44:10.530 --> 44:12.530
Get back, get back!

44:12.532 --> 44:14.066
Get back!

44:26.512 --> 44:28.979
- What's going on?
- Shit, and all of them.

44:28.981 --> 44:31.883
Oh, God, now what we gonna do?

44:31.885 --> 44:33.416
The house.

44:33.418 --> 44:35.519
Back in there?

44:38.423 --> 44:41.561
Well, what are you
waiting for?

44:49.235 --> 44:51.001
- Now what?
- Weapons.

44:51.003 --> 44:53.004
- Weapons?
- Have that.

44:53.006 --> 44:55.171
I'm not working now, mate.

44:55.173 --> 44:56.673
Use it to defend yourself with!

44:56.675 --> 44:58.376
We're supposed to
fight them off with these?

44:58.378 --> 45:00.111
I don't think we've
got much choice, mate.

45:00.113 --> 45:01.114
There's one outside!

45:10.657 --> 45:11.859
Move.

45:18.164 --> 45:20.564
We know
you're in there, gentlemen.

45:20.566 --> 45:22.198
What do you want from us?

45:22.200 --> 45:24.635
I would've thought
that was obvious by now.

45:24.637 --> 45:28.071
She still want her
carpets fitted?

45:28.073 --> 45:30.209
We're intending to have you
for dinner.

45:34.113 --> 45:35.249
Move!

45:50.729 --> 45:53.233
- Dean, in here.
- Shit.

45:55.468 --> 45:56.633
What are we doing?

45:56.635 --> 45:57.536
Hide.

46:00.206 --> 46:02.976
- And I suggest you do the same!
- Brilliant.

46:54.026 --> 46:57.128
Get off me,
you fucking asshole!

46:57.130 --> 46:59.329
Whenever you're ready, Col!

47:02.135 --> 47:03.566
Get back!

47:03.568 --> 47:05.104
Get back! Get back!

47:13.546 --> 47:15.115
Come on!

47:53.552 --> 47:55.352
All right, that's it.
We're well fucked.

47:55.354 --> 47:57.655
This has got to be
the worst job we've been on.

47:57.657 --> 48:00.157
Get your phone out, ring Nigel,
let him know what's going on.

48:00.159 --> 48:02.193
Good idea,
but it's at home on charge.

48:02.195 --> 48:04.128
- What?
- It was dead before I left.

48:04.130 --> 48:06.396
- Where's yours?
- Well, I left it in the van.

48:06.398 --> 48:07.798
Oh, great.
Good night, carpet fitters.

48:07.800 --> 48:10.166
- We are dead.
- Just calm down, all right?

48:10.168 --> 48:12.538
We'll just stay here,
and we'll wait it out.

48:20.613 --> 48:23.414
Hey, Col, look at this stuff.

48:23.416 --> 48:26.816
Bet it's worth a fortune.
Where do they get it all from?

48:26.818 --> 48:30.456
I don't know. Let's wait until
they come down and ask them.

48:43.503 --> 48:46.169
- As I suspected.
- What's that?

48:46.171 --> 48:47.637
These carpets.

48:47.639 --> 48:49.673
Nigel was knocking them out
dirt cheap in the shop.

48:49.675 --> 48:53.376
Really? How interesting.

48:53.378 --> 48:55.912
That old bird's been
in the shop, you know?

48:55.914 --> 48:57.914
I bet this one's
worth a few pounds.

49:00.485 --> 49:01.484
Col?

49:01.486 --> 49:03.255
You all right?

49:09.262 --> 49:12.595
Not really, mate.
I just fell through the floor!

49:12.597 --> 49:15.432
Hang on. I'll see if I can
find something to get you out.

49:15.434 --> 49:18.769
Let's find
the little bastards!

49:18.771 --> 49:20.803
Shit. They're coming.

49:20.805 --> 49:24.274
Well, go on, save yourself.
I'm done for.

49:24.276 --> 49:25.675
I ain't leaving ya.

49:25.677 --> 49:28.611
Get to the van.
My phone's in there.

49:28.613 --> 49:32.850
Okay, okay.
I'll be back, mate, I promise.

49:32.852 --> 49:34.821
Just go!

49:40.559 --> 49:43.896
Somebody's been playing
with my toys.

50:03.816 --> 50:05.548
Come on down.

50:05.550 --> 50:08.519
I'd like to see you
make a pie out of me!

50:08.521 --> 50:10.553
Silly fool.

50:10.555 --> 50:15.626
I'm not going to eat you,
but he might.

50:15.628 --> 50:17.227
Who?

50:17.229 --> 50:20.597
You'll find out.

50:26.972 --> 50:30.874
Oi, come back,
you silly cow!

50:30.876 --> 50:32.345
Oi!

50:48.561 --> 50:49.863
Shit.

50:58.503 --> 50:59.838
Col?

51:00.939 --> 51:02.342
Dean?

51:03.809 --> 51:06.410
Listen, guys, don't be mad.

51:06.412 --> 51:08.412
I know you told me
to stay in the van,

51:08.414 --> 51:10.780
but it was dark,
and it was hot, and it was...

51:10.782 --> 51:12.451
Tasha!

51:24.963 --> 51:26.896
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

51:26.898 --> 51:28.534
Okay.

51:34.907 --> 51:36.606
Okay.

51:36.608 --> 51:39.709
All right, mate, calm down.

51:39.711 --> 51:42.379
I get it.
You're pissed off

51:42.381 --> 51:44.751
'cause the whole
staple in the foot thing.

52:13.012 --> 52:14.510
Shit.

52:14.512 --> 52:17.583
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

52:20.985 --> 52:23.622
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

52:33.865 --> 52:35.901
Don't look at me.
You shot him.

52:54.686 --> 52:58.521
You fucking little bastard!

52:58.523 --> 53:01.658
Right! Before we get
any more unwanted attention,

53:01.660 --> 53:04.764
dispose of your
brother's body, please!

53:06.731 --> 53:08.999
Is she still in there?

53:09.001 --> 53:11.468
Get her in
for tomorrow's supper,

53:11.470 --> 53:14.771
and please get rid
of that bloody van!

53:14.773 --> 53:18.075
If I have to see that fucking
stupid logo one more time,

53:18.077 --> 53:20.814
I'll have all your balls
for breakfast!

53:38.430 --> 53:41.432
Oi! Go hide
your brother's body first,

53:41.434 --> 53:44.167
then I'll let you have a bite.

53:44.169 --> 53:45.568
Go on!

53:45.570 --> 53:47.873
Get out and get on with it!

54:39.825 --> 54:43.160
Come on to my land,

54:43.162 --> 54:47.064
into my house,

54:47.066 --> 54:52.936
and think that you can
kill my boys?

54:52.938 --> 54:56.008
You gob shites don't know
who you're messing with.

55:01.213 --> 55:04.680
Oh, for Christ's sake.
What now?

55:43.155 --> 55:45.222
You all right, mate?

55:45.224 --> 55:48.026
She trap you down here
as well?

56:08.847 --> 56:11.150
Somebody get me the fuck
out of here.

56:16.956 --> 56:19.990
What the hell is
going on in here?

56:21.626 --> 56:24.294
I take it
you've let him get away.

56:24.296 --> 56:27.330
This is ridiculous!

56:27.332 --> 56:30.100
Well? You gonna go and find
the little ginger bastard

56:30.102 --> 56:33.035
or hang around me
like a wet dog all day, hey?

56:33.037 --> 56:35.608
Or do I have to do
everything myself?

56:39.345 --> 56:40.813
No, no, no, no, no.

57:09.675 --> 57:12.175
Have you got through
to anyone yet?

57:12.177 --> 57:13.376
Nope.

57:13.378 --> 57:15.077
Have you even tried?

57:15.079 --> 57:17.648
Uh, yes, I've tried
both Tash and Chris,

57:17.650 --> 57:18.881
thank you very much.

57:18.883 --> 57:19.918
No answer.

57:21.653 --> 57:23.653
Right.

57:23.655 --> 57:25.657
Give us the phone.
I'll give Colin a try.

57:40.872 --> 57:42.705
Hello.

57:42.707 --> 57:43.809
Colin?

57:44.843 --> 57:46.142
Ah...

57:46.144 --> 57:48.614
Hello?

57:50.215 --> 57:53.383
Why doesn't anyone
answer their bloody phone?

57:53.385 --> 57:55.017
What happened?

57:55.019 --> 57:56.687
I'm not sure.

57:56.689 --> 58:01.291
Oh, I hope it's not
another plumber call out.

58:01.293 --> 58:03.296
Keep trying them, hey?

58:11.369 --> 58:13.805
Yes. Yes!

58:18.477 --> 58:20.947
Yes! Lads! Lads!

58:27.852 --> 58:29.021
Oh, shit.

58:30.354 --> 58:31.657
Shit!

58:53.746 --> 58:58.080
So you can't find
the little shite anywhere?

58:58.082 --> 59:01.454
If he's got out, we're ruined,
do you know that?

59:03.454 --> 59:06.756
When it gets dark, we'll send
Charlie out after him.

59:06.758 --> 59:08.961
Until then,
start packing your stuff.

59:10.262 --> 59:11.794
When Harry gets back,

59:11.796 --> 59:14.766
we'll take a little holiday,
I think.

59:30.148 --> 59:31.249
Yes.

59:39.490 --> 59:41.490
Come on.

59:41.492 --> 59:43.392
Yes.

59:44.997 --> 59:46.199
Fuck!

59:47.832 --> 59:49.202
Okay.

59:51.235 --> 59:53.403
Emergency. Which service?

59:53.405 --> 59:55.972
Police, ambulance. Anything with
flashing lights, yeah?

59:55.974 --> 59:57.506
Sir, I need you to tell me
which service you require.

59:57.508 --> 59:59.209
Fire, ambulance, or police.

59:59.211 --> 01:00:01.178
I need police, but probably
an ambulance as well.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:02.812
Connecting
to multiple services.

01:00:02.814 --> 01:00:05.148
- Thank God.
- What is your location?

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:07.584
I don't know, I'm in the middle
of fucking nowhere, mate!

01:00:07.586 --> 01:00:08.919
Did you say Norfolk?

01:00:08.921 --> 01:00:10.854
No, I don't know where I am.

01:00:10.856 --> 01:00:12.888
What is the nature
of your call, sir?

01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:15.225
I don't know. It's been
one of those days, you know?

01:00:15.227 --> 01:00:18.061
Please calm down, sir,
and explain the best you can.

01:00:18.063 --> 01:00:20.095
Okay, right, where to start?

01:00:20.097 --> 01:00:23.099
Um, well, I found
some fingers in a toilet,

01:00:23.101 --> 01:00:24.934
my friend ate a pie
that had a nipple in it,

01:00:24.936 --> 01:00:26.570
then the cannibals
tried to get us,

01:00:26.572 --> 01:00:29.573
one of them shot a spear
through my friend's cheek,

01:00:29.575 --> 01:00:32.408
and my other mate, he fell
through the trap door thingy,

01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:34.544
and he's still
trapped down there.

01:00:34.546 --> 01:00:36.546
Is there an adult with you?

01:00:36.548 --> 01:00:38.247
I'm an adult.

01:00:39.418 --> 01:00:40.919
Hello?

01:00:42.588 --> 01:00:43.923
Oh.

01:01:38.242 --> 01:01:39.945
Stay back!

01:01:51.689 --> 01:01:54.057
I did warn ya!

01:02:44.575 --> 01:02:45.608
Please.

01:02:45.610 --> 01:02:47.012
I'm done.

01:03:10.102 --> 01:03:12.501
Hello. Cupid Carpets.
Jade speaking.

01:03:12.503 --> 01:03:14.704
- Jade, thank God! It's Dean!
- You all right?

01:03:14.706 --> 01:03:16.338
Yeah, is your dad there?
I ain't got long.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:19.642
It's been proper boring
here today, you know?

01:03:19.644 --> 01:03:21.510
Jade, can you just
get Nigel, please?

01:03:21.512 --> 01:03:23.146
All right, touchy!

01:03:23.148 --> 01:03:24.680
You haven't messed
another job up, have ya?

01:03:24.682 --> 01:03:26.682
'Cause he'll be well pissed.

01:03:26.684 --> 01:03:30.220
Here he is now. Dad!

01:03:30.222 --> 01:03:32.091
Dean on the phone.

01:03:34.726 --> 01:03:37.292
Hello, Dean.

01:03:37.294 --> 01:03:39.428
Please tell me
it's all going okay.

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:42.231
Nige, it ain't gone
quite to plan.

01:03:42.233 --> 01:03:43.332
What do you mean?

01:03:43.334 --> 01:03:46.102
What have you broke this time?

01:03:46.104 --> 01:03:50.106
I swear, Dean, if you and Colin
have botched this one up,

01:03:50.108 --> 01:03:52.207
you better start looking
for somewhere else to work.

01:03:52.209 --> 01:03:54.544
No, listen, we are in
serious trouble here, yeah?

01:03:57.581 --> 01:03:59.249
Listen, Nige,
this is gonna die on me.

01:03:59.251 --> 01:04:02.718
You got to get help.
Get help to the house, yeah?

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.055
Hello?

01:04:05.523 --> 01:04:07.390
Oh, come on!

01:04:09.061 --> 01:04:10.563
He heard me. He must've.

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:20.437
What was all that about?

01:04:20.439 --> 01:04:21.504
Not sure.

01:04:21.506 --> 01:04:23.573
Reception's terrible.

01:04:23.575 --> 01:04:25.608
I'm gonna head over there.

01:04:25.610 --> 01:04:28.077
I can't afford this, Jade.

01:04:28.079 --> 01:04:30.579
Bloody cowboys,
the lot of them.

01:04:30.581 --> 01:04:33.716
Have they messed up?
Are you sacking them?

01:04:33.718 --> 01:04:37.253
I'm not going
to sack anyone yet.

01:04:37.255 --> 01:04:39.388
Depends what's happened.

01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:41.557
I trust I can leave you
to lock up?

01:04:41.559 --> 01:04:43.660
- Yeah, fine.
- All right, well, I'll go over

01:04:43.662 --> 01:04:47.463
and see if I can fix whatever
mess they've made, then.

01:04:47.465 --> 01:04:49.532
You get Natasha on the mobile,

01:04:49.534 --> 01:04:52.301
see what's going on
and let me know, okay?

01:04:52.303 --> 01:04:53.635
Yeah, yeah, no worries.

01:04:53.637 --> 01:04:55.775
Right, I'll see you later.

01:04:57.275 --> 01:04:59.309
Tell your mother

01:04:59.311 --> 01:05:02.048
I'm probably going
to be working late.

01:05:14.392 --> 01:05:17.359
Guess what, man.
I finished early, yeah.

01:05:17.361 --> 01:05:19.064
What you doing?

01:05:54.633 --> 01:05:56.231
Malcolm, get the fuck
in the van!

01:05:56.233 --> 01:05:57.834
I think you've just
killed someone!

01:05:57.836 --> 01:06:00.403
I know. Don't worry.
He was a cannibal.

01:06:00.405 --> 01:06:03.539
Oh, I kind of feel
less guilty now.

01:06:03.541 --> 01:06:05.543
- Well, get in!
- Okay.

01:06:09.648 --> 01:06:11.513
What the hell
were you doing out here?

01:06:11.515 --> 01:06:14.283
Long story.
See what they did to Tash?

01:06:14.285 --> 01:06:16.486
- I know, mate, I know.
- Have you called anyone?

01:06:16.488 --> 01:06:18.655
I got hold of Nigel,
and I think he's on his way out.

01:06:18.657 --> 01:06:20.689
What a nightmare!

01:06:20.691 --> 01:06:24.193
How many are there
of these cannibals?

01:06:24.195 --> 01:06:26.229
- Malcolm, you're a genius.
- Huh?

01:06:26.231 --> 01:06:27.629
There was three
and the old bag.

01:06:27.631 --> 01:06:28.865
Now that one's roadkill,

01:06:28.867 --> 01:06:30.200
the fat one
fell out the window.

01:06:30.202 --> 01:06:31.633
That's who that was.

01:06:31.635 --> 01:06:33.803
Which means it's just
the big bald fella left.

01:06:33.805 --> 01:06:35.671
We can take him.

01:06:35.673 --> 01:06:37.941
Why have we got
to go back in there?

01:06:37.943 --> 01:06:39.211
To get Col.

01:07:11.276 --> 01:07:12.878
You!

01:07:14.813 --> 01:07:16.414
Going somewhere?

01:07:18.983 --> 01:07:20.351
Come on.

01:07:21.352 --> 01:07:22.517
Where are we going?

01:07:22.519 --> 01:07:23.785
Col's in the basement.

01:07:23.787 --> 01:07:24.854
Keep 'em peeled.

01:07:24.856 --> 01:07:26.592
Big fella's a sneaky bugger.

01:07:31.296 --> 01:07:34.631
Quick, before he uses
his giant fish gun!

01:07:40.505 --> 01:07:42.972
You know that part
where you said we can take him?

01:07:42.974 --> 01:07:44.907
- Yeah?
- That was a lie, right?

01:07:44.909 --> 01:07:46.744
In here!

01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:53.983
He seems really angry.

01:07:53.985 --> 01:07:56.952
Probably 'cause you just punched
his mother in the face.

01:07:56.954 --> 01:07:59.321
You think reckon
that's upset him?

01:07:59.323 --> 01:08:01.260
Do you realize there's
another door there, right?

01:08:13.972 --> 01:08:16.341
Sorry.

01:08:34.392 --> 01:08:35.957
Malcolm!

01:08:55.979 --> 01:08:57.383
Please! No! No!

01:09:05.823 --> 01:09:06.858
Oi!

01:09:09.393 --> 01:09:11.029
Asshole!

01:09:41.925 --> 01:09:44.696
I got one!

01:09:46.865 --> 01:09:48.965
Oh. Nice one, buddy.

01:09:50.602 --> 01:09:51.600
Dean!

01:09:51.603 --> 01:09:53.069
Oh, bother!

01:09:59.677 --> 01:10:01.847
That old woman
is doing my head in.

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:05.383
Let's go get Col.

01:10:09.586 --> 01:10:12.390
Dean, what are we even
looking for?

01:10:14.793 --> 01:10:17.059
That, Malcolm.

01:10:17.061 --> 01:10:19.095
And how are we gonna
get down there?

01:10:19.097 --> 01:10:20.930
I don't know yet.

01:10:20.932 --> 01:10:22.998
- Still got your lighter?
- Oh, yeah.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.699
I don't have any cigs left,
though, so...

01:10:24.701 --> 01:10:27.372
No, so we can see
what we're doing down there.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.162
You evil bitch!

01:10:53.531 --> 01:10:54.566
Malc!

01:10:55.967 --> 01:10:58.103
Malc, are you alive, mate?

01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:02.640
Malcolm!
Malcolm, you there?

01:11:04.909 --> 01:11:06.111
Fuck!

01:11:13.218 --> 01:11:16.488
Col, you better be alive, mate.

01:11:56.628 --> 01:11:57.795
Col.

01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:00.566
Colin.

01:12:10.207 --> 01:12:12.108
Fuck's sake.

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:13.579
Col!

01:12:18.282 --> 01:12:20.017
Come on, you bastard.

01:13:00.325 --> 01:13:02.094
You fucking stink.

01:13:20.911 --> 01:13:23.048
Dean, now, mate!

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:43.902
Dean!

01:14:13.397 --> 01:14:15.166
That's enough! Let's go!

01:14:17.367 --> 01:14:19.034
What's the matter?

01:14:19.036 --> 01:14:20.735
That looks like
a nasty bite, mate.

01:14:20.737 --> 01:14:22.337
You think I'm gonna
turn into one?

01:14:22.339 --> 01:14:24.208
Don't be so stupid!

01:14:28.312 --> 01:14:30.881
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:14:42.693 --> 01:14:44.095
What the hell?

01:14:46.964 --> 01:14:48.800
I'm gonna bloody kill 'em!

01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:54.837
Hello!

01:14:54.839 --> 01:14:56.073
Dean?

01:14:57.107 --> 01:14:58.376
Colin!

01:14:59.844 --> 01:15:02.011
Anyone in?

01:15:02.013 --> 01:15:04.015
Can anybody hear me?

01:15:07.418 --> 01:15:09.254
Mrs. Hanning!

01:15:17.327 --> 01:15:19.865
Well, this is all seems
a little bit odd.

01:15:44.921 --> 01:15:46.387
You find some backup?

01:15:46.389 --> 01:15:48.324
- I found Malcolm.
- Well, where is he, then?

01:15:48.326 --> 01:15:50.228
He didn't make it, mate.

01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:55.299
Poor sod.

01:15:59.402 --> 01:16:00.838
Over there!

01:16:08.446 --> 01:16:09.948
Fucking wedged shut, mate!

01:16:11.249 --> 01:16:12.416
This way!

01:16:14.451 --> 01:16:15.454
Shit!

01:16:18.022 --> 01:16:19.357
Hello?

01:16:21.459 --> 01:16:22.894
Dean?

01:16:24.128 --> 01:16:25.461
Colin?

01:16:25.463 --> 01:16:28.265
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

01:16:31.835 --> 01:16:33.968
Hello?

01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:36.040
Is anyone down there?

01:16:38.142 --> 01:16:39.945
This is useless.

01:16:42.446 --> 01:16:45.381
Hi, Colin, it's Nigel.

01:16:45.383 --> 01:16:48.818
Can you give me a ring when
you get this message, please?

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:51.857
I'm at the house,
and there's just...

01:17:26.857 --> 01:17:28.990
Here, look, Col, look!

01:17:28.992 --> 01:17:30.995
- Yes!
- Oh, you beauty.

01:17:34.298 --> 01:17:36.297
It's a way out, mate!

01:17:36.299 --> 01:17:37.900
Yes!

01:17:42.138 --> 01:17:44.172
Shit, Col, I think he's coming!

01:17:44.174 --> 01:17:46.378
Go, go, go!

01:18:04.461 --> 01:18:05.627
Charlie!

01:18:05.629 --> 01:18:08.499
We're leaving!

01:18:09.967 --> 01:18:13.071
I suggest you get
your arse up here!

01:18:25.249 --> 01:18:27.018
Time to go.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.401
- You all right?
- Yeah.
