<i>Previously on  "The Secret Life 
Of The American Teenager"...</i>

00:02.909 --> 00:04.070
- What's going on?
- It's good news.

00:04.106 --> 00:05.673
I started my period.
I'm not pregnant.

00:05.707 --> 00:07.908
Oh, thank God.
Really?
Really.

00:09.845 --> 00:11.279
So you're off the hook.

00:11.313 --> 00:13.447
Are you sure you want to get
back with Ben

00:13.482 --> 00:15.316
even after he and Adrian
were together?

00:15.350 --> 00:17.585
I still love him
no matter what he did.

00:17.619 --> 00:19.887
- I got my license.
- Congratulations.

00:19.921 --> 00:21.222
I really want to show you
my car.

00:21.256 --> 00:23.224
Do you really love me?
Yeah.

00:23.258 --> 00:25.059
Diyou want to have
a baby with me?
No.

00:25.093 --> 00:27.295
So let's just forget
that this ever happened.

00:27.329 --> 00:28.896
He and Adrian did something
they shouldn't have,

00:28.930 --> 00:30.298
and she thought
she was pregnant.

00:30.332 --> 00:32.098
How is it she thought
she was and then she's not?

00:32.134 --> 00:35.102
We're moving.
Is there any possibili
you could stay with a friend

00:35.137 --> 00:36.337
you're senior year
of high school?

00:36.371 --> 00:37.505
Sure, I have
plenty of friends.

00:37.539 --> 00:38.673
How are things with that guy?

00:38.707 --> 00:40.975
You know his name.
Grant.

00:41.009 --> 00:44.945
I swear to you, Amy Juergens,
I will never do anything again
to hurt you.

00:44.980 --> 00:46.914
I'm on the pill.
Are you having sex?

00:46.948 --> 00:48.282
You're okay
if she's on the pill?

00:48.317 --> 00:50.718
Obviously it's okay with her
if you're on the pill.

00:50.752 --> 00:52.286
If you need some help
or want to talk,

00:52.321 --> 00:53.654
I'm there for you, Adrian.

00:53.689 --> 00:54.655
<i>[Recorded Female Voice]

<i>please call back

01:00.529 --> 01:02.530
Hey, Ricky.
Hey, I just wanted
to thank you again

01:02.564 --> 01:04.765
for last night,
for making me go talk to Amy.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.134
You have no idea how happy
I am being back together
with her,

01:07.169 --> 01:08.636
so thanks again.

01:08.670 --> 01:10.071
Here's the research.

01:10.105 --> 01:11.138
What research?

01:11.173 --> 01:12.740
On early pregnancy tests.

01:12.774 --> 01:14.875
I don't need it.
Adrian's not pregnant.

01:14.910 --> 01:16.143
I went over there
and talked to her.

01:16.178 --> 01:17.845
That would be good enough
for me.

01:17.879 --> 01:20.548
It's not good enough for me.
Ben, did you or did you not
see the stick,

01:20.582 --> 01:21.649
the results of the test.

01:21.683 --> 01:23.984
I saw the results,
and they were wrong.

01:24.019 --> 01:26.320
Those tests are very accurate.
They're not wrong.

01:26.355 --> 01:29.056
What, do you want it
to be right?

01:29.091 --> 01:31.158
You want Adrian to be having
my baby?

01:31.193 --> 01:32.860
I want you to not be duped
into thinking

01:32.894 --> 01:34.362
she's not having your baby
if she is,

01:34.396 --> 01:35.896
and if she is, the sooner
you find out, the better

01:35.931 --> 01:38.032
because the earlier
the better when it comes
to making a decision

01:38.066 --> 01:39.867
about terminating pregnancy

01:39.901 --> 01:41.902
or even when it comes
to taking care of a pregnancy.

01:41.937 --> 01:42.903
You need to know.

01:42.938 --> 01:44.572
I do know.

01:44.606 --> 01:46.741
You're only going
by what she told you.

01:46.775 --> 01:48.275
Well, what else can I go by?

01:48.310 --> 01:49.276
The test.

01:49.311 --> 01:50.678
And what,
do you want me to ask her

01:50.712 --> 01:51.779
to take a second test?

01:51.813 --> 01:53.047
Good idea.

01:53.081 --> 01:54.582
I can't do that?

01:54.616 --> 01:56.050
I'm not going to do that.

01:56.084 --> 01:58.452
As far as I'm concerned,
this chapter in my life
is closed,

01:58.487 --> 02:00.488
and I'm opening
a new chapter with Amy.

02:00.522 --> 02:01.622
I saw her last night.

02:01.656 --> 02:03.090
We're back together,

02:03.125 --> 02:04.358
and tonight we're celebrating.

02:04.393 --> 02:06.694
Then I really hope Adrian
is not pregnant.

02:06.728 --> 02:09.497
She's not.
Come on, let's go.

02:09.531 --> 02:12.233
This is the first day
of the rest of my life
with Amy Juergens,

02:12.267 --> 02:13.434
and we're going to be
a family,

02:13.468 --> 02:15.169
the family we should've been
all along.

02:18.774 --> 02:20.741
Unless he has another family.

02:27.349 --> 02:29.116
Hey, coffee?

02:29.151 --> 02:31.752
Oh, thanks.
I guess I've got time.

02:31.787 --> 02:33.687
Got another long day today

02:33.722 --> 02:35.089
so I won't be home until late.

02:35.123 --> 02:37.024
What are you going to do
for dinner?

02:37.058 --> 02:39.894
I don't know,
pick something up.

02:39.928 --> 02:42.329
Uh, do you know
when Mom's coming home?

02:42.364 --> 02:43.898
End of the week.

02:43.932 --> 02:46.467
You need something?
Anything I can do?

02:46.501 --> 02:48.335
No, I was just wondering.

02:48.370 --> 02:50.237
If you're wondering
because neither of us

02:50.272 --> 02:52.173
every goes to the grocery store,

02:52.207 --> 02:54.975
let me give you some money
in case you want to pick up
some real food.

02:55.010 --> 02:58.212
I might want something
other than pizza
for breakfast tomorrow.

02:58.246 --> 03:00.080
What's wrong with pizza
for breakfast?

03:00.115 --> 03:01.482
I think it's better
the next day.

03:01.516 --> 03:05.319
Hmm, well... enjoy.

03:05.353 --> 03:06.487
Have a good day.

03:06.521 --> 03:08.489
Bye.

03:08.990 --> 03:10.157

Mom says
we're going to be late.

04:13.904 --> 04:15.438
I'm not speaking to you.

04:15.472 --> 04:18.341
You just did,
but I'm not speaking
to you either.

04:18.375 --> 04:20.176
That's why I said, "Mom said
we're going to be late"

04:20.211 --> 04:22.178
as opposed to just,
"We're going to be late."

04:22.213 --> 04:24.214
Why did you have to tell them
I'm on birth control pills?

04:24.248 --> 04:26.516
You know, it just sounded
as if you spoke to me

04:26.550 --> 04:28.318
although you just said
you're not speaking to me.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.453
Now they're going to suspect
that I'm having sex with Ben.

04:30.487 --> 04:31.521
So what?

04:31.555 --> 04:32.655
If you're going to have sex,

04:32.690 --> 04:33.923
why don't you just tell
the truth for once

04:33.958 --> 04:36.392
and say, "Mom, Dad,
I'm having sex with Ben."

04:36.427 --> 04:37.594
Because I'm not.

04:37.628 --> 04:39.462
Then what do you want
the pills for?

04:39.496 --> 04:41.364
In case I change my mind.

04:41.398 --> 04:42.765
What do you want
the pills for?

04:42.800 --> 04:45.368
Same reason.
Now let's just go back
to not talking.

04:45.402 --> 04:46.836
Mom said
we're going to be late.

04:49.406 --> 04:51.241
Hey, did you make up with
your sister like I asked?

04:51.275 --> 04:52.609
We're talking.
Good.

04:52.643 --> 04:54.077
What's so good about it?

04:54.111 --> 04:55.845
It gives us the illusion
that we're all still a family,

04:55.879 --> 04:57.180
a happy family.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.448
No one's going to believe
that,

04:58.482 --> 05:00.383
not with Mom refusing
to marry you again.

05:02.119 --> 05:03.519
Can we just move out again?

05:03.554 --> 05:05.021
No, we're not going anywhere.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.189
We're going to make this work.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.124
Yeah, okay.

05:08.158 --> 05:09.626
Well, do you mind
if I move out?

05:09.660 --> 05:11.761
You can have the garage again.
You can have my room.

05:11.795 --> 05:13.296
And just where do
you think you would go?

05:13.330 --> 05:15.198
I think I would go back
next door

05:15.232 --> 05:17.033
In fact I think I'm going to
go over there right now

05:17.067 --> 05:18.134
and get a ride to school,

05:18.168 --> 05:19.636
because Amy's still
trying to figure out

05:19.670 --> 05:21.738
what she's wearing,

05:21.772 --> 05:22.805
you know, because she's back
with Ben now

05:22.840 --> 05:24.040
so she wants to look good.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.643
Why? So he'll want
to have sex with her?

05:26.677 --> 05:28.811
That would be my guess.

05:32.516 --> 05:34.384
Hey, you dressed?
I want to talk to you.

05:34.418 --> 05:36.719
I'm dressed.
I'm dressed!

05:38.555 --> 05:39.822
You're not dressed enough.

05:39.857 --> 05:41.224
Your shirt's too low,
and your skirt's too high.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.258
Try again.

05:42.293 --> 05:43.393
Mom said we were going
to be late.

05:43.427 --> 05:44.894
Mom's not even here.
She's at the gym.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.096
Ashley said--

05:47.131 --> 05:49.632
She is such a liar.
She lies, lies, lies.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.067
And so do you.
And so do you.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.368
So does your mother,
but you know what?

05:52.403 --> 05:54.504
We're all going to stop lying.
We're a family.

05:54.538 --> 05:55.738
Yeah, a family of liars.

05:55.773 --> 05:56.839
Well, that's going to stop.

05:56.874 --> 05:58.441
Your mother and I have decided

05:58.475 --> 06:00.843
we're all going to start
having dinner together again
every night.

06:00.878 --> 06:02.145
We're all going to work
our way through this

06:02.179 --> 06:04.347
by talking to each other
with honesty and respect.

06:04.381 --> 06:06.182
Just come straight home from
the nursery with John tonight.

06:06.216 --> 06:08.551
Dinner's at 6:00.
Conversation starts at 6:02.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.353
I was going to have dinner
with Ben tonight.

06:10.387 --> 06:12.155
It's our first night
back together.

06:12.189 --> 06:14.023
He's taking me to dinner,
a nice dinner,

06:14.058 --> 06:15.758
where people aren't forced
to talk to each other.

06:15.793 --> 06:17.226
Invite him over.

06:17.261 --> 06:18.761
Here?

06:18.796 --> 06:20.330
Dad.
Amy.

06:25.669 --> 06:28.338
Hey, will you mind having me
ride to school with you?

06:28.372 --> 06:30.106
Uh...

06:30.140 --> 06:31.607
Wait, is that vomit?

06:31.642 --> 06:32.775
Who puked?

06:32.810 --> 06:34.711
I did.

06:34.745 --> 06:37.747
Oh, no.

06:37.781 --> 06:42.085
Yeah. Oh, no.

06:42.119 --> 06:44.087
Ashley--
Where are the trash bags?

06:44.121 --> 06:46.856
Under the sink.

06:46.890 --> 06:49.225
I'm going to get the pizza
out of here.

06:49.259 --> 06:50.760
Thank you.

06:50.794 --> 06:53.830
Too bad we don't have
any of that stuff
the school janitor uses.

06:53.864 --> 06:55.698
Yeah, I think I'm going to be
needing some of that.

07:03.674 --> 07:06.075
You know, if you want to stay
home, I could stay with you.

07:06.110 --> 07:08.010
Why would you do that?

07:08.045 --> 07:10.179
Why would I miss school?
Are you kidding?

07:10.214 --> 07:12.882
No, I should go.

07:12.916 --> 07:14.984
We should go.
We have to go.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.553
Not if you have the flu.

07:19.590 --> 07:21.090
And even if you don't have
the flu

07:21.125 --> 07:24.227
and you just want to talk,

07:24.261 --> 07:26.295
remember I've been
through this before.

07:26.330 --> 07:28.097
with someone else
who didn't have the flu.

07:32.169 --> 07:35.304
Taken properly,
the tests are 99% accurate.

07:35.339 --> 07:38.174
That means they're wrong
1% of the time.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.876
When the tests are wrong,
it usually goes the other way,

07:39.910 --> 07:41.377
and the tests come up negative

07:41.412 --> 07:43.479
because they haven't picked up
an indication of pregnancy

07:43.514 --> 07:45.281
from the HCG hormone levels

07:45.315 --> 07:47.984
because it's just too early.

07:48.018 --> 07:49.051
Look, I'm just telling you this

07:49.086 --> 07:50.553
because your mom told me
to tell you this.

07:50.587 --> 07:51.954
The tests are accurate.

07:51.989 --> 07:53.923
Maybe Adrian read it wrong.

07:53.957 --> 07:57.960
Hmm, Adrian's a smart girl.
I doubt it.

07:57.995 --> 08:00.096
Maybe she's not pregnant
because she had an abortion.

08:00.130 --> 08:03.199
I can't believe
you would say that
about Adrian.

08:04.435 --> 08:05.435
Because?

08:05.469 --> 08:06.936
Because I told her
not to do that,

08:06.970 --> 08:09.205
and I don't think
she would do that.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.274
I don't like you
for saying that about her.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.513
Wow.

08:21.819 --> 08:25.655
I took out the garbage cans
to the curb.

08:25.689 --> 08:28.925
Doctor, next time your turn.

08:28.959 --> 08:31.027
I don't mind taking turns
doing that,

08:31.061 --> 08:32.562
although I do have
a job to get to.

08:32.596 --> 08:33.696
Yeah, yeah.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.731
Hey, you know
what I was thinking?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.133
You should think
about getting a job.

08:37.167 --> 08:39.135
In this economy?

08:39.169 --> 08:41.404
You did have a job
at one point, right?

08:41.438 --> 08:44.106
I did.
And?

08:46.243 --> 08:48.911
You tell him.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.613
What?
What happened to his job?

08:50.647 --> 08:55.084
Oh, they don't provide
anger management classes
to part-time employees.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.954
Yeah, some guy made
some rude comment to some
woman they were working with,

08:57.988 --> 09:00.656
and Tom punched him.

09:00.691 --> 09:02.658
It was a really rude comment.

09:02.693 --> 09:04.794
Well, then, good for Tom
for punching people at work.

09:04.828 --> 09:06.629
You think?

09:06.663 --> 09:07.897
No.

09:07.931 --> 09:10.399
Oh, how did it go with Grace?

09:10.434 --> 09:12.468
Do you want her to hate me?

09:12.503 --> 09:13.736
No.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.771
All right, then from now on,
you talk to her.

09:15.806 --> 09:17.340
Okay?

09:17.374 --> 09:19.008
I'll see you later.
Okay.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:28.485 --> 09:30.186
So where should I take Amy
for dinner?

09:30.220 --> 09:32.355
Wings, dude.
That's where it all began.

09:32.389 --> 09:34.156
No, I want to take her
to some place nicer
than that.

09:34.191 --> 09:36.359
I hate to bring this up now,
but before you go there tonight,

09:36.393 --> 09:37.727
I think maybe
you should tell Grace

09:37.761 --> 09:39.328
that you and Amy
are back together.

09:39.363 --> 09:40.863
I thought about telling her,

09:40.898 --> 09:42.465
but I was having
such a good day yesterday.

09:42.499 --> 09:43.666
I didn't want to ruin it.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.134
You mean with something
like the truth?

09:45.168 --> 09:46.869
Yeah. Look, I thought about it,

09:46.904 --> 09:49.305
but why put myself through that
and put her through that?

09:49.339 --> 09:50.540
We weren't together anyway,

09:50.574 --> 09:51.707
so I'd just be calling her
to say

09:51.742 --> 09:53.175
that we're never
going to be together.

09:53.210 --> 09:54.277
That seems wrong.

09:54.311 --> 09:55.678
No, it doesn't.

09:55.712 --> 09:57.113
You know Grace wants you
to be more than a friend.

09:57.147 --> 09:58.514
Yeah, but with Grace Bowman

09:58.549 --> 10:00.283
that doesn't
necessarily mean sex.

10:00.317 --> 10:02.785
With her it's friends
with limited benefits.

10:02.819 --> 10:05.354
Are you finished, Hank?
I suggest you do right
by Grace

10:05.389 --> 10:07.657
because I think
that you and Adrian
might still have a problem,

10:07.691 --> 10:10.927
a kind of problem that Amy
is not going to overlook.

10:10.961 --> 10:13.229
Would you drop it?

10:13.263 --> 10:15.031
Adrian and I have been friends
for a long time,

10:15.065 --> 10:16.632
and she didn't hide
anything from me before,

10:16.667 --> 10:18.467
so why would she try to hide
anything from me now?

10:18.502 --> 10:19.669
And don't an3wer that

10:19.703 --> 10:21.037
because this is the end
of the discussion.

10:21.071 --> 10:22.638
[slams]

10:30.113 --> 10:32.415
[gasps]
Just the person
I was looking for.

10:32.449 --> 10:35.151
Uh-huh. Were you going
to tell me

10:35.185 --> 10:36.452
that you were over
at Amy's last night?

10:37.521 --> 10:39.722
Adrian saw you, you and Ricky.

10:39.756 --> 10:42.291
Why don't we go out
and see your car?

10:42.326 --> 10:44.393
I have something
I need to tell you.

10:44.428 --> 10:47.163
Is it worth going
out to my car for?

10:47.197 --> 10:49.599
Well, no, I guess
I can tell you here.

10:49.633 --> 10:51.200
You and Amy are back together,

10:51.234 --> 10:52.635
and it's going to be
better than ever.

10:52.669 --> 10:54.971
I'm sorry.

10:55.005 --> 10:58.574
I really do like you, Grace,
but Amy and I have so much
history together,

10:58.609 --> 11:02.178
and I really want
our relationship to be
better than ever.

11:02.212 --> 11:04.246
so I hope we can
make it work this time.

11:04.281 --> 11:06.716
And as stupid as it sounds,

11:06.750 --> 11:08.684
I hope that you and I
can still be friends.

11:08.719 --> 11:11.420
I understand.

11:11.455 --> 11:13.189
I'm disappointed,
but I understand.

11:14.691 --> 11:16.025
And you know what?
We are friends,

11:16.059 --> 11:18.828
and as your friend I really do
want you to be happy

11:18.862 --> 11:20.663
because you deserve
to be happy,

11:20.697 --> 11:23.499
especially after everything
Adrian put you through,

11:23.533 --> 11:25.167
and I really think
she should've found out

11:25.202 --> 11:27.536
what the situation was first
before she scared you
like that.

11:27.571 --> 11:28.771
No, I think she did
the right thing

11:28.805 --> 11:30.039
in coming to me.

11:30.073 --> 11:32.875
If she was scared,
I deserve to be scared, too.

11:32.909 --> 11:35.911
See, you're such a nice guy.

11:35.946 --> 11:39.148
Nice guys are so hard to find.

11:39.182 --> 11:41.083
Amy's really lucky,

11:41.118 --> 11:43.352
you know,
other than getting pregnant.

11:43.387 --> 11:45.121
[chuckles]

11:45.155 --> 11:48.257
Anyway, have you seen
Adrian this morning?

11:48.291 --> 11:50.793
Because I called her
and texted her and nothing.

11:50.827 --> 11:52.928
Do you have any idea
where she is or what's going
on with her?

11:52.963 --> 11:54.530
I hope she's okay.

11:54.564 --> 11:58.634
No, I haven't seen her,
but I hope she's okay, too.

11:58.669 --> 12:01.170
If she's not okay
and you want to talk,

12:01.204 --> 12:06.776
feel free to call me, OK?
Bye.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.735
- Who you looking for?
- Why do you want to know?

12:20.769 --> 12:23.671
- Just making conversation.
- Why?

12:23.705 --> 12:25.773
Here's the thing.
Oh, no.

12:25.807 --> 12:26.974
My dad got a new job.

12:27.008 --> 12:28.309
He and my mom are moving.

12:28.343 --> 12:30.010
We live in a house
that belongs to the church

12:30.045 --> 12:31.479
so I kind of need
a place to--
No.

12:31.513 --> 12:33.447
I have my kid,
and I don't need another one.

12:33.482 --> 12:35.616
It would just be for a year,
and I'm not a kid.
All right?

12:35.650 --> 12:36.984
I'm a responsible guy.

12:37.018 --> 12:38.652
I could help out
around the house.

12:38.687 --> 12:40.421
It's not like you'd be
looking out for me
or anything.

12:40.455 --> 12:42.490
I don't want a roommate,
and even if I did,

12:42.524 --> 12:44.558
I can't have a roommate.
I just got shared custody.

12:44.593 --> 12:46.861
I had to to fight for that.
I'm not going to screw that up.

12:46.895 --> 12:49.730
All right, well,
can I just say you said
that I could live there?

12:49.765 --> 12:51.365
What good would that do?

12:51.399 --> 12:53.634
If my parents think
I have a place to stay,

12:53.668 --> 12:56.303
then my dad can accept the job,
and they'll take off.

12:56.338 --> 12:57.805
Yeah, I guess
you could do that.

12:57.839 --> 12:59.006
All right.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.075
Where are you really
going to stay?

13:01.109 --> 13:03.344
I don't know.
I'll find some place.

13:03.378 --> 13:05.846
I'm not worried.
[whispers]
Thanks.

13:08.416 --> 13:10.885
Hey, look who's here.
Me.

13:10.919 --> 13:12.353
You're going
to school here now?

13:12.387 --> 13:13.687
Not now. Next fall.

13:13.722 --> 13:14.789
Have you seen Ashley?

13:14.823 --> 13:17.024
No.

13:17.058 --> 13:18.292
But you stay away from her.

13:19.861 --> 13:22.196
Ouch.
Told you he has
a thing for her.

13:22.230 --> 13:23.964
No, he doesn't,
and even if he does,

13:23.999 --> 13:26.167
she doesn't have
a thing for him,
and you know what?

13:26.201 --> 13:28.068
She doesn't have a thing
for you either,

13:28.103 --> 13:30.538
so transferring her
would be a big mistake.

13:30.572 --> 13:32.640
I'm telling you,
Ashley's not going to be
happy about this,

13:32.674 --> 13:34.308
and she really hates
surprises.

13:34.342 --> 13:35.843
We can get past that,

13:35.877 --> 13:36.877
and what choice do I have?

13:36.912 --> 13:38.579
If I ask, she'll just say no.

13:38.613 --> 13:40.147
She's got a whole summer
to get used to the idea,

13:40.182 --> 13:41.549
so if she's not happy now,

13:41.583 --> 13:43.150
she'll be happy later,

13:43.185 --> 13:45.019
and I don't mean that
in a stalker kind of way.

13:45.053 --> 13:46.187
Ashley needs me.

13:48.356 --> 13:51.091
She doesn't need you.
She doesn't need anyone,

13:51.126 --> 13:53.460
and that's both her strength
and her weakness,

13:53.495 --> 13:55.729
and you can't be hanging
around me all the time

13:55.764 --> 13:57.198
because people are going
to start thinking

13:57.232 --> 13:59.834
that we're not just cousins,
that we're kissing cousins,

13:59.868 --> 14:01.735
and I'm trying to get
a boyfriend.

14:01.770 --> 14:04.271
How you gonna get
a boyfriend hanging out
with my future girlfriend?

14:04.306 --> 14:06.307
She's not
your future girlfriend,

14:06.341 --> 14:08.709
but she is my current friend,

14:08.743 --> 14:11.579
and if you come here,
you're going to have to make
some friends of your own.

14:11.613 --> 14:12.813
Thought you had a boyfriend.

14:12.848 --> 14:14.281
Who was the guy at the wedding?

14:14.316 --> 14:15.683
Oh, no, he's just a friend,

14:15.717 --> 14:18.619
a friend with a lot
of tough stuff going on
in his life,

14:18.653 --> 14:19.987
and he needed to get out.

14:20.021 --> 14:21.155
He's not out?

14:21.189 --> 14:23.724
Outside.
Oh.

14:23.758 --> 14:26.827
Why can't you just stay
at your school?

14:26.862 --> 14:28.429
Because my school
doesn't have Ashley.

14:28.463 --> 14:31.699
[groans]
Why did I do this to myself?

14:36.238 --> 14:37.972
Where are you?
Why aren't you at school?

14:38.006 --> 14:39.673
Because I didn't feel
like coming in today.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.175
<i>Why not?</i>

14:41.209 --> 14:43.110
Because I felt like taking
the day off.

14:43.144 --> 14:44.311
Why is that?
Why today?

14:44.346 --> 14:45.913
Why not today?

14:45.947 --> 14:47.348
Don't you want to see
your boyfriend?

14:47.382 --> 14:48.616
Your boyfriend's here.

14:48.650 --> 14:50.451
Boyfriend?
What boyfriend?

14:50.485 --> 14:52.920
Oh, I'm sorry,
not boyfriend.
Companion.

14:52.954 --> 14:54.321
Who are you talking about?

14:54.356 --> 14:56.790
<i>That Grant guy.</i>

14:56.825 --> 14:59.059
He's at school?
Yeah, this school.

14:59.094 --> 15:01.462
Well, this is the first
I've heard of this.

15:01.496 --> 15:03.097
Where are you anyway?

15:03.131 --> 15:04.498
Ashley.

15:07.302 --> 15:09.303
Who was that?

15:09.337 --> 15:11.605
It was Ricky.
He was just letting me know

15:11.640 --> 15:13.107
Amy's looking for me.

15:13.141 --> 15:15.643
Why would Ricky call you?
Why didn't Amy call you?

15:15.677 --> 15:18.078
I told you we're not speaking
to each other.

15:18.113 --> 15:21.548
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

15:21.583 --> 15:22.950
[sighs]

15:24.986 --> 15:26.820
You're still in love
with Ricky, aren't you?

15:26.855 --> 15:29.590
No, I'm really not.

15:29.624 --> 15:32.760
I can't let myself be
in love with Ricky
anymore.

15:32.794 --> 15:35.429
Being in love with Ricky
is what got me where
I am today.

15:35.463 --> 15:37.731
Might even hate Ricky.

15:41.269 --> 15:43.170
You wanted to see me?

15:43.204 --> 15:45.005
Sit down, Miss Juergens.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.341
If this is about Ashley,
I don't know where she is.

15:47.375 --> 15:49.243
She said she was going to get
a ride in with Adrian.

15:49.277 --> 15:50.778
She called.
Adrian's car is on the fritz,

15:50.812 --> 15:52.346
and they're waiting for AAA,

15:52.380 --> 15:54.415
but that's not
what this is about.
Have a seat.

15:57.986 --> 16:00.654
I have something
very exciting to tell you,

16:00.689 --> 16:03.490
some life-changing news.

16:03.525 --> 16:05.259
[humming]

16:09.030 --> 16:11.632
[continues humming]

16:13.335 --> 16:14.468
You don't get it, do you?

16:14.502 --> 16:15.836
No.

16:15.870 --> 16:20.341
âª It's up to you,
New York, New York âª

16:20.375 --> 16:23.811
I just really need to talk
to Ben, Ben Boykewich.

16:23.845 --> 16:25.646
We're supposed to go out
tonight.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.082
It's our first time going out
in a really, really long time,

16:28.116 --> 16:29.516
and my dad won't let me go.

16:29.551 --> 16:32.386
He wants Ben to come over
for dinner instead.

16:32.420 --> 16:34.688
OH, that is really important.

16:34.723 --> 16:35.956
Do you want me to announce
that over the P.A.?

16:35.991 --> 16:37.424
Uh--
[clears throat]

16:37.459 --> 16:38.926
Ben Boykewich, Amy Juergens
cannot go to dinner,

16:38.960 --> 16:40.361
but you can come
to her house for dinner.

16:40.395 --> 16:41.662
Please contact her immediately.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.430
Then your personal life
will be taken care of,

16:43.465 --> 16:44.932
and we can get back
to school business.

16:44.966 --> 16:48.035
What does New York have to do
with school business?

16:48.069 --> 16:49.636
You, Amy Juergens,

16:49.671 --> 16:51.105
have been invited to attend

16:51.139 --> 16:52.940
a four-week, all expenses paid,

16:52.974 --> 16:54.308
program for young musicians

16:54.342 --> 16:56.043
at the Nabokoff School
For Music

16:56.077 --> 16:57.611
this summer in New York

16:57.645 --> 16:58.946
Can you believe it?

16:58.980 --> 17:01.348
I saw this summer program
for young women,

17:01.383 --> 17:03.884
and I know you really want
to go to Juilliard some day,

17:03.918 --> 17:05.919
and, well,
this is the first step.

17:05.954 --> 17:07.688
You can go to Nabokoff...

17:07.722 --> 17:09.556
this summer for four weeks.

17:09.590 --> 17:11.125
New York, whoo!

17:11.159 --> 17:13.060
This some kind of, like,
cruel joke or something?

17:13.094 --> 17:14.161
You know I can't go
to New York.

17:14.194 --> 17:15.262
I have a baby.

17:15.296 --> 17:17.598
And that baby has a daddy

17:17.632 --> 17:19.500
and a grandfather
and a grandmother,

17:19.534 --> 17:22.069
two grandfathers,
two grandmothers,
and an aunt.

17:22.103 --> 17:23.436
It doesn't matter.

17:23.471 --> 17:24.938
It does matter, Amy.

17:24.973 --> 17:26.140
It totally matters.

17:26.174 --> 17:28.142
This is four weeks
that could change your life.

17:28.175 --> 17:29.810
I can't change my life.

17:29.844 --> 17:31.578
Maybe I don't even want
to change my life.

17:31.613 --> 17:33.213
Maybe I want to stay
right here this summer

17:33.248 --> 17:35.015
and try to make things
work out with Ben.

17:35.050 --> 17:36.784
I love Ben.

17:39.454 --> 17:43.090
Oh, my God. New York?

17:49.095 --> 17:52.598
- How did you get that?
- How did I get that?

17:52.632 --> 17:54.233
It's not easy to play
a French horn.

17:54.267 --> 17:55.568
I've been practicing for years.

17:55.602 --> 17:57.269
Dr. Bink heard
about the program,

17:57.304 --> 17:59.872
and Mr. Sedlack gave her
a DVD of my solo I'm learning.

17:59.906 --> 18:03.876
Are those two, Sedlack and Bink,
You know?

18:03.910 --> 18:07.079
No.
No, I don't think so.

18:07.113 --> 18:08.214
Doesn't matter.

18:08.248 --> 18:09.615
This is really amazing.

18:09.649 --> 18:11.283
I mean, of course I can't go,

18:11.318 --> 18:13.686
but still, just to even get
the offer.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.887
Why can't you go?

18:14.921 --> 18:16.422
Uh, John.

18:16.456 --> 18:18.490
Take him with you?

18:18.525 --> 18:19.992
You were going to take him
to Italy

18:20.026 --> 18:21.193
when you wanted to go
with Ben.

18:21.228 --> 18:22.728
I was an idiot then.

18:22.762 --> 18:24.129
That was last summer.

18:24.164 --> 18:26.332
Yeah, I know, but still...

18:26.366 --> 18:27.733
I mean, I'm
a responsible mother now.

18:27.767 --> 18:30.236
I can't just take John
with me to New York.

18:30.270 --> 18:32.972
I'd be living in a dorm,
going to school all day,

18:33.006 --> 18:34.473
and I have a job here.

18:34.507 --> 18:35.674
I can't go.

18:35.709 --> 18:36.876
Can't go where?

18:36.910 --> 18:38.844
Hi, Ricky.

18:38.879 --> 18:40.346
Bye.
Bye.

18:42.015 --> 18:43.148
Where you going?

18:43.183 --> 18:45.284
I'm not going anywhere,

18:45.318 --> 18:48.287
but I did get an offer to go
to a summer music program
in New York,

18:48.321 --> 18:50.122
which would lead to Juilliard,

18:50.156 --> 18:51.924
It's the Nabokoff School
Of Music.

18:51.958 --> 18:54.159
No kidding.
That's pretty impressive.

18:54.194 --> 18:55.394
Yeah.

18:55.428 --> 18:57.329
I guess I could keep John,

18:57.364 --> 18:59.064
but I just pushed Ben
to go back with you,

18:59.099 --> 19:01.100
so you probably
shouldn't just take off.

19:01.134 --> 19:03.235
You pushed Ben?
What does that mean?

19:03.270 --> 19:06.171
Well, I mean, he was hesitating
for whatever reason,

19:06.206 --> 19:07.673
and I encouraged him
to go back with you,

19:07.707 --> 19:08.874
and if it doesn't work out,

19:08.909 --> 19:10.042
feel free to blame it on me.

19:10.076 --> 19:11.777
This time it'll work out.

19:11.811 --> 19:13.112
Well, if it doesn't.

19:13.146 --> 19:14.246
It will.

19:14.281 --> 19:15.581
I hope so.

19:15.615 --> 19:17.249
Why change since last night?

19:17.284 --> 19:20.152
No. Congratulations
on getting the offer,

19:20.186 --> 19:22.955
and my condolences
on not being able to accept.

19:22.989 --> 19:25.524
What time am I picking up
John tonight?

19:25.558 --> 19:28.227
Ben and I aren't going
out tonight.

19:28.261 --> 19:29.295
My dad won't let me,

19:29.329 --> 19:31.163
so I'm going to ask Ben
to have dinner

19:31.197 --> 19:32.698
with my stupid family.

19:32.732 --> 19:35.634
Why can't I just take off?
Ben took off last summer.

19:35.669 --> 19:37.102
And how did that turn out?

19:37.137 --> 19:40.172
It's not Bologna.
It's New York.

19:40.206 --> 19:41.807
Doesn't matter.
I'm not going.

19:41.841 --> 19:43.175
I'm not even going
to dinner tonight.

19:43.209 --> 19:45.144
I just have to find Ben
and tell him.

19:45.178 --> 19:46.145
You looking for Ben?

19:46.179 --> 19:47.813
I'm looking for Ben.

19:52.786 --> 19:54.320
Later.

19:55.221 --> 19:56.956
Don't be late for work.

20:00.193 --> 20:01.393
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

20:01.428 --> 20:03.963
I'm sorry.

20:03.997 --> 20:05.798
I found out I got into
the summer music program

20:05.832 --> 20:07.566
in New York.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.968
I was in the
counselor's office

20:09.002 --> 20:10.703
and then I had to go see
Mr. Sedlack and then--

20:10.737 --> 20:12.738
Summer music program
in New York?

20:12.772 --> 20:14.840
Wow. Congratulations.

20:14.874 --> 20:18.911
[laughs]
Of course I'm not going.
I can't, but...

20:18.945 --> 20:20.079
I'm sorry.

20:20.113 --> 20:21.380
I know how tough it must be

20:21.414 --> 20:23.515
for you to keep having
to pass up opportunities,

20:23.550 --> 20:25.284
but you're such a good mother.

20:25.318 --> 20:27.219
Yeah, um, about that,

20:27.253 --> 20:28.487
about being a mother

20:28.521 --> 20:30.356
and part of a family,

20:30.390 --> 20:32.157
my dad won't let us go
out tonight.

20:32.192 --> 20:34.293
He and my mother have
this stupid idea

20:34.327 --> 20:36.428
that we're all going
to start eating together
again every night

20:36.463 --> 20:38.597
so we can, like, bond
or something,

20:38.631 --> 20:39.832
but you're invited.

20:39.866 --> 20:41.300
I'd love to come.

20:41.334 --> 20:44.670
You don't have to.
Really, it's going to be
awful.

20:44.704 --> 20:46.638
Ashley and I aren't even
speaking to each other.

20:46.673 --> 20:48.040
What's new?

20:48.074 --> 20:49.441
Amy, I love your family,

20:49.476 --> 20:51.076
and I want to be
a part of your family

20:51.111 --> 20:52.945
just like I want you to be
a part of my family

20:52.979 --> 20:56.582
because some day I hope
that you and I are a family.

20:56.616 --> 20:58.817
Me, too.
Some day.

20:58.852 --> 21:00.486
So what time's dinner?

21:00.520 --> 21:01.487
6:00.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.155
I'll come straight after work.

21:03.189 --> 21:05.124
Me, too.
See you then.

21:08.628 --> 21:10.729
Hi.
[slams]

21:10.764 --> 21:13.432
[slams table]
Ben broke up with me.

21:13.466 --> 21:16.235
Broke up with you?
Yeah, today at school.

21:16.269 --> 21:17.569
Are those my jeans?

21:17.604 --> 21:18.837
No.

21:18.872 --> 21:19.938
Those look like my jeans.

21:19.973 --> 21:21.540
They're not your jeans.

21:21.574 --> 21:23.008
Now, go back to Ben.

21:23.043 --> 21:25.444
Honey, what happened with Ben?

21:25.478 --> 21:27.279
I didn't know you considered
the two of you to be together.

21:27.313 --> 21:28.614
I thought you were
just friends.

21:28.648 --> 21:30.449
You knew we wanted to be
more than friends.

21:30.483 --> 21:31.650
No, I really didn't.

21:31.684 --> 21:33.318
I thought that maybe you
might want to find a guy

21:33.353 --> 21:35.154
who, well, I don't know,

21:35.188 --> 21:37.956
didn't have any possibility
of being pregnant
with your best friend.

21:37.991 --> 21:39.491
There's no possibility.

21:39.526 --> 21:42.194
Just because your stupid
husband's a doctor
and a gynecologist

21:42.228 --> 21:44.296
doesn't mean he knows
everything about pregnancy.

21:44.330 --> 21:46.965
He doesn't know anything
about Adrian or her womb.

21:48.234 --> 21:49.868
[knock on door]

21:51.304 --> 21:52.971
[groans]
What is he doing here?

21:53.006 --> 21:54.573
Grace Bowman.

21:54.607 --> 21:56.075
[groans]

21:58.678 --> 22:00.412
Just because Ben broke up
with me

22:00.447 --> 22:02.047
does not mean I'm every going
to go out with you again.

22:02.082 --> 22:05.317
Of course not.
May I come in?

22:05.351 --> 22:06.452
Hi, Mrs. Bowman.

22:06.486 --> 22:08.187
Is it still Mrs. Bowman?

22:08.221 --> 22:09.721
Zegay, Mrs. Zegay.

22:09.756 --> 22:11.056
When did that happen?

22:11.091 --> 22:12.391
When I got married.

22:12.425 --> 22:13.792
Congratulations on that.

22:13.827 --> 22:15.227
Thank you, Jack.

22:17.464 --> 22:19.731
So how are the cabinets working?

22:19.766 --> 22:21.667
Do you need me to tighten them
up or anything?
No.

22:21.701 --> 22:23.569
They're working
just fine.

22:23.603 --> 22:25.170
Thank you. Jack,
why don't you sit down?

22:25.205 --> 22:27.940
And Grace will get you
something to drink,

22:27.974 --> 22:29.341
and I'll let
the two of you guys talk.

22:29.375 --> 22:31.276
Actually I wanted to talk
to you.

22:31.311 --> 22:33.679
To her?
About what?

22:33.713 --> 22:35.681
Grace is upset because
I'm wearing her jeans.

22:35.715 --> 22:37.416
I knew those were my jeans.

22:37.450 --> 22:39.952
You gave them away.
I kept them.

22:39.986 --> 22:42.654
Sorry, Jack.
So what was it?
What was going on?

22:42.689 --> 22:43.922
My dad's leaving the church.

22:43.957 --> 22:45.591
On his own will?

22:45.625 --> 22:47.526
Yeah, yeah.
Why?

22:47.560 --> 22:49.561
He got offered a job
teaching philosophy

22:49.596 --> 22:50.596
at his alma mater,

22:50.630 --> 22:52.264
so he and my mom want
to move to Phoenix,

22:52.298 --> 22:54.933
but they can't unless
I find a place to live
my senior year.

22:54.968 --> 22:56.335
You can't live here.

22:56.369 --> 22:57.736
Grace.

22:57.770 --> 23:00.172
Well, you can't,
but she shouldn't say it
like that.

23:00.206 --> 23:04.309
It's just that, well,
you know I'm a newlywed,

23:04.344 --> 23:06.712
and we're trying to bond here
as a family right now.

23:06.746 --> 23:09.114
I don't really think
it will work out and--

23:09.149 --> 23:10.516
oh, and you had sex
with Grace,

23:10.550 --> 23:11.617
and Tom hates you.

23:11.651 --> 23:13.452
I guess that about covers it.

23:13.486 --> 23:14.987
[Kathleen laughs]
[chuckles]

23:15.021 --> 23:17.222
Yeah, but, well,
you're more than welcome
to stay for dinner.

23:17.257 --> 23:18.657
Thank you.

23:18.691 --> 23:19.691
[scoffs]

23:23.830 --> 23:24.796
[sighs]

23:24.831 --> 23:26.031
Oh, I love this.

23:26.065 --> 23:28.300
My mom's next door cooking
and cleaning house

23:28.334 --> 23:29.902
and looking after Robbie,

23:29.936 --> 23:33.772
and I'm right over the fence
skipping school and eating
ice cream.

23:33.806 --> 23:35.807
This is the best school day
I've ever had in my life.

23:35.842 --> 23:38.010
You know you're going
to get in trouble.

23:38.044 --> 23:41.346
Yeah, I know.
I don't care.

23:41.381 --> 23:42.848
I think it's worth it.

23:42.882 --> 23:46.251
If you can't do the time,
don't do the crime.

23:46.286 --> 23:48.887
And, besides,
if I get busted,

23:48.922 --> 23:50.355
then that'll give us
something to talk about

23:50.390 --> 23:52.057
at that family dinner.

23:52.091 --> 23:53.692
If the dinner's
unpleasant enough,

23:53.726 --> 23:56.061
then maybe we won't have
to have dinner together
every night.

23:56.095 --> 23:59.932
You know what, Ashley?
You're fearless.

23:59.966 --> 24:01.200
Yeah, so are you.

24:01.234 --> 24:04.036
No, I'm more dangerous
than fearless,

24:04.070 --> 24:05.437
but the thing we have
in common

24:05.471 --> 24:08.941
is that neither of us really
cares what anyone thinks.

24:08.975 --> 24:10.242
Yeah, that's true.

24:10.276 --> 24:13.345
I really don't care
what anyone thinks

24:13.379 --> 24:15.280
as long as I feel
like I'm doing the right thing.

24:17.383 --> 24:21.119
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

24:21.154 --> 24:22.354
You know what?

24:22.388 --> 24:24.089
If people find out
that I was pregnant

24:24.123 --> 24:26.959
or later find out
that I had an abortion,

24:26.993 --> 24:28.727
I can live with that.

24:28.761 --> 24:30.295
Maybe that's what I have to do.

24:30.330 --> 24:31.563
That's what's best for me.

24:31.598 --> 24:33.398
I have to do what's best
for me.

24:33.433 --> 24:37.236
And it's really no one else's
business except for maybe Ben's.

24:38.805 --> 24:40.439
Should you tell Ben?

24:40.473 --> 24:44.443
Ben doesn't want to know.

24:44.477 --> 24:46.378
Ben just wants to be
with your sister.

24:47.847 --> 24:49.848
And you know what?
That's what's best for Ben,

24:49.882 --> 24:51.550
so I'm not going to get
in his way.

24:51.584 --> 24:54.253
Besides, Ben doesn't know
about things like this.

24:54.287 --> 24:55.487
He's a rich kid.

24:55.521 --> 24:57.256
He's been totally protected
his whole life

24:57.290 --> 24:58.924
from anything messy like this.

24:58.958 --> 25:01.093
I mean, he's a nice guy.

25:01.127 --> 25:03.295
He's a romantic guy,

25:03.329 --> 25:06.465
but I don't think
he can deal with reality,

25:06.499 --> 25:08.567
not this kind of reality,

25:08.601 --> 25:11.136
not without suffering
the rest of his life.

25:13.106 --> 25:15.407
When I saw
how heartbroken he was,

25:15.441 --> 25:17.042
when that test was positive,

25:17.076 --> 25:21.179
I knew that I couldn't just
continue to include him

25:21.214 --> 25:22.914
in this nightmare.

25:22.949 --> 25:24.650
He can't handle it.

25:24.684 --> 25:26.485
It would break him.

25:26.519 --> 25:30.422
I don't know.
I mean, he went to the clinic
with Amy when you drove them,

25:30.456 --> 25:32.691
when she was thinking
about abortion.

25:32.725 --> 25:34.860
That wasn't his baby.

25:34.894 --> 25:36.361
Oh, right.

25:36.396 --> 25:39.197
And I don't need him to go
with me.

25:39.232 --> 25:40.866
I'm going to tell my mother.

25:40.900 --> 25:43.535
My mother will go with me.

25:43.569 --> 25:45.370
I dread telling her.

25:45.405 --> 25:47.706
I know she'll be upset.

25:47.740 --> 25:49.041
I don't know
if she'll understand.

25:55.782 --> 25:57.249
Thanks, Ashley.

25:57.283 --> 25:59.318
Thanks for being here
with me today.

26:00.353 --> 26:01.586
[knock on door]

26:02.322 --> 26:05.857
Uh-oh.

26:05.892 --> 26:07.125
You want me to get
rid of him?

26:08.161 --> 26:09.995
Oh, God.

26:12.365 --> 26:15.434
No, I'll get rid of him.

26:15.468 --> 26:17.302
You mind waiting
for me upstairs?

26:37.056 --> 26:38.290
Are you pregnant?

27:03.680 --> 27:05.515
Thank you.

27:10.954 --> 27:12.154
What are you doing?

27:12.189 --> 27:15.958
Alphabetizing the pasta,
from angel hair to ziti.

27:15.993 --> 27:17.360
That screams busy work.

27:17.394 --> 27:20.029
If you need busy work,
I'll give you busy work.

27:20.063 --> 27:22.031
I'm just trying to make time
go by quickly

27:21.565 --> 27:23.600
because I'm going
to Amy's tonight.

27:23.634 --> 27:25.201
I've never been
to Amy's house for dinner,

27:25.236 --> 27:28.204
so it's kind of like I'm...
part of the family.

27:28.239 --> 27:31.608
In that case,
let me help you with that.

27:33.477 --> 27:36.880
Put them back how they were
for the last 50 years,

27:36.914 --> 27:38.481
in size order,

27:38.516 --> 27:41.484
from risotto to lasagna.

27:41.519 --> 27:44.554
Oh, I didn't realize.

27:54.165 --> 27:57.033
That's what you're doing?
Trying to make the time
go fast

27:57.068 --> 27:59.569
till you can get to Amy's?

27:59.603 --> 28:02.472
OR do you have something
on your mind that
you're trying to forget?

28:02.506 --> 28:04.074
Like?

28:04.108 --> 28:06.843
I don't know.
You tell me.

28:07.578 --> 28:08.645
I don't know.

28:08.679 --> 28:10.680
You want to tell me anything?

28:10.714 --> 28:13.316
Uh, I don't think so.

28:13.350 --> 28:14.484
Are you sure?

28:14.518 --> 28:16.920
No.

28:16.954 --> 28:18.488
Do you want to tell me
anything?

28:18.522 --> 28:20.924
Because I'm sensing that
there's something on your mind.

28:20.958 --> 28:23.693
What's going on
with you and Adrian?

28:25.896 --> 28:27.130
All right, you know.

28:28.966 --> 28:31.568
I don't know how you know,
but you know.

28:31.602 --> 28:33.803
We thought she was pregnant,
but she's not.

28:34.872 --> 28:36.372
I guess I should've told you,

28:36.407 --> 28:39.843
but it didn't seem like it was
really any of your business

28:39.877 --> 28:41.211
or anyone's business

28:41.245 --> 28:42.278
except mine and Adrian's.

28:42.313 --> 28:44.114
Shouldn't you have told me

28:44.148 --> 28:46.082
when I was trying to get
you and Amy back together?

28:46.117 --> 28:48.284
You did get us back together,

28:48.319 --> 28:51.254
and no because I wanted
to get back with Amy,

28:51.288 --> 28:52.789
and Adrian's not pregnant,

28:52.823 --> 28:56.159
so why shouldn't Amy and I
get back together?

28:56.193 --> 28:58.128
Ben, Adrian is pregnant.

28:58.162 --> 28:59.496
No, she's not.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.064
Yes, she is,

29:01.098 --> 29:03.099
and if she told you she isn't,
she lied.

29:03.134 --> 29:05.135
Shut up.

29:05.169 --> 29:06.236
You don't know anything.

29:06.270 --> 29:07.770
Ben, I know Adrian.

29:07.805 --> 29:12.075
No.
Yes, I do,

29:12.109 --> 29:13.476
and Adrian is pregnant, Ben.

29:13.511 --> 29:15.211
She is.

29:15.246 --> 29:17.180
Neither you nor Adrian
may want that to be true,

29:17.214 --> 29:18.548
but it is true.

29:18.582 --> 29:20.984
She's not.

29:21.018 --> 29:22.752
I'm your friend, Ben.
Listen to me.

29:22.786 --> 29:24.154
No.

29:24.188 --> 29:25.855
All right.

29:25.890 --> 29:27.924
Maybe you can't hear me
right now,

29:27.958 --> 29:30.160
but if you need me,
let me know.

29:36.467 --> 29:37.834
Jerk.

29:42.506 --> 29:45.041
Hey, what's for dinner?

29:45.075 --> 29:47.243
Butternut squash.
You want some?

29:47.278 --> 29:48.545
No, I mean for us,
the family.

29:48.579 --> 29:51.314
Oh, I don't know.
Chinese?

29:51.348 --> 29:52.815
What happened
to the family dinner?

29:52.850 --> 29:54.217
I thought we were
going to start having
family dinners again?

29:54.251 --> 29:55.518
Not tonight.

29:55.553 --> 29:56.786
Well, tonight.

29:56.820 --> 29:58.154
I told Amy she can't go
to dinner with Ben tonight

29:58.189 --> 29:59.155
because we're having
dinner tonight,

29:59.190 --> 30:00.456
together as a family.

30:00.491 --> 30:02.759
Well, then you should've
said something to me.

30:02.793 --> 30:04.494
Should've said something
to you?

30:04.528 --> 30:06.262
You're the one who said
we're going to start
having family dinners.

30:06.297 --> 30:08.231
You said that.
I didn't mean tonight.

30:08.265 --> 30:10.066
Yeah, but you didn't specify
that it wasn't tonight either,

30:10.100 --> 30:11.534
so I took control.

30:11.569 --> 30:13.736
You never think I do
anything to try to make us
more of a family

30:13.771 --> 30:15.004
so I made a decision.

30:15.039 --> 30:16.940
Well, then you should've let
me in on the decision,

30:16.974 --> 30:19.409
especially if you expected me
to cook the dinner,

30:19.443 --> 30:22.312
so that way in between doing
laundry and housekeeping

30:22.346 --> 30:24.080
and running to the bank
and changing diapers

30:24.114 --> 30:25.648
and walking your dog,

30:25.683 --> 30:27.183
then I could've gone
to the market as well.

30:27.218 --> 30:28.918
You know, if you want us to be
more of a family,

30:28.953 --> 30:31.020
then you cook the dinner
or make the call.

30:31.055 --> 30:32.055
You order in Chinese.

30:32.089 --> 30:33.523
Why don't I order in English?

30:33.557 --> 30:34.624
It'll get here faster.

30:34.658 --> 30:35.992
Very funny.

30:36.026 --> 30:37.760
Just order the food,
and we'll all eat Chinese

30:37.795 --> 30:40.330
in the dining room together,
one big happy family.

30:40.364 --> 30:42.365
Fine.
Fine.

30:42.399 --> 30:44.067
I told Amy
she could invite Ben.

30:44.101 --> 30:46.135
Well, he's not
part of the family,

30:46.170 --> 30:47.303
not yet anyway.

30:47.338 --> 30:48.838
I mean, I don't are
if he comes over,

30:48.872 --> 30:50.640
but I thought the whole idea
of a family dinner

30:50.674 --> 30:52.408
is that we all bond together
as a family.

30:52.443 --> 30:54.711
Well, I invited him,
so we'll bond around him.

30:54.745 --> 30:56.446
I'll call China Palace.

31:00.517 --> 31:01.985
Hello, Ashley.

31:02.019 --> 31:03.152
How was school today?

31:04.321 --> 31:05.321
How did you get home?

31:05.356 --> 31:06.522
I walked.

31:06.557 --> 31:08.358
Your mother asked you
how school was.

31:08.392 --> 31:12.028
Awesome. I learned so much
I feel like my head's going
to explode.

31:12.062 --> 31:13.196
Mm-hmm.

31:13.230 --> 31:14.931
I know. I saw you
over at Adrian's.

31:14.965 --> 31:16.432
Yeah, she went
over there to get a ride.

31:16.467 --> 31:17.667
She and Amy aren't speaking.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.202
Yeah, I know that,

31:19.236 --> 31:20.603
but did you also know
that she and Adrian

31:20.638 --> 31:21.904
did not go to school today?

31:23.574 --> 31:25.842
What? We didn't go to school?
Huh?

31:25.876 --> 31:28.511
Yeah, I saw you over
at Adrian's all day long,
Ashley.

31:28.545 --> 31:30.313
Really? You didn't come
and get me?

31:30.347 --> 31:32.515
Nope, and you want
to know why?

31:32.549 --> 31:34.884
I don't know if I care.
Why?

31:34.918 --> 31:37.553
Because Ashley thinks
that she's all grown up.

31:37.588 --> 31:40.456
She thinks that she's old enough
to make all of her own decisions

31:40.491 --> 31:42.892
about boys and sex
and birth control,
so you know what?

31:42.926 --> 31:44.327
That means
that she's old enough

31:44.361 --> 31:45.928
to be responsible
for everything else
in her life,

31:45.963 --> 31:47.563
school included,

31:47.598 --> 31:48.965
so if she doesn't go
to school

31:48.999 --> 31:50.099
and she gets in trouble,

31:50.134 --> 31:51.267
we're not bailing her out,

31:51.302 --> 31:53.002
and if she doesn't make
good grades

31:53.037 --> 31:54.037
and doesn't get into college,

31:54.071 --> 31:55.238
it's her problem.

31:56.740 --> 31:57.874
She's my new favorite.

31:59.743 --> 32:02.145
What the hell are you doing?
You trying to be
the cool mom now?

32:02.179 --> 32:03.880
I'm trying to be
a better mom.

32:03.914 --> 32:05.715
Well, it doesn't sound as if
you're being a mom at all.

32:05.749 --> 32:06.716
She doesn't have to go
to school?

32:06.750 --> 32:07.884
She'll go.

32:07.918 --> 32:09.285
Have you lost your mind?

32:10.754 --> 32:15.525
Hey, stop right there,
young lady.

32:15.559 --> 32:16.826
I'm not talking to your back.

32:16.860 --> 32:18.261
I don't care
who your favorite is.

32:18.295 --> 32:20.296
Sorry.

32:20.331 --> 32:22.332
I'm not your favorite?
Really?

32:24.034 --> 32:26.502
Fine, I don't care.
Be that way,

32:26.537 --> 32:28.037
but you  not get to make
decisions,

32:28.072 --> 32:29.672
like whether or not
you're going to school,
at 15.

32:29.707 --> 32:32.408
Birth control is one thing.
Education is another.

32:32.443 --> 32:35.411
Birth control is an option.
School is not an option.
You got that?

32:35.446 --> 32:37.513
But mom just said
I could decide.

32:37.548 --> 32:39.215
You can't just split up
the parents

32:39.249 --> 32:41.050
and go with whichever one
tells you the thing
you want to hear.

32:41.085 --> 32:43.219
Then you should've let me know
that years ago.

32:43.253 --> 32:44.654
I'm letting you know that
right now.

32:44.688 --> 32:47.490
Maybe you should let Mom
know that.

32:47.524 --> 32:49.926
You're not the boss of me
or your mother

32:49.960 --> 32:51.027
or anyone.

32:51.061 --> 32:52.729
I'm the boss of me.

32:52.763 --> 32:54.397
Mom just said so.
Jeez.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.633
That was Jeff.
He's still at the hospital,

32:57.668 --> 32:59.435
so I guess we can just eat
in here.

32:59.470 --> 33:02.805
Thank you for letting me stay.
For dinner.

33:02.840 --> 33:05.074
For dinner.

33:05.109 --> 33:07.777
Well, well, well, well,

33:07.811 --> 33:10.747
Parents move off
and leave you, huh?

33:10.781 --> 33:12.615
Not yet.

33:12.649 --> 33:14.717
Hey, Tom, can you run up
and tell your sister

33:14.752 --> 33:16.719
Jeff's going to be late so we
can go ahead and eat now?

33:16.754 --> 33:19.856
Make yourself useful.
You know the way.

33:22.226 --> 33:23.359
All right.

33:23.394 --> 33:25.962
[sighs]

33:28.132 --> 33:30.500
Would you be nice, please?

33:30.534 --> 33:35.371
Who's not being nice?
Not me.

33:39.910 --> 33:41.310
Your mom says we can eat now.

33:41.345 --> 33:43.513
Can you come in?
I want to ask you something.

33:44.748 --> 33:48.050
All right.

33:48.085 --> 33:50.887
Do you think there's
any chance that Adrian
could be lying,

33:50.921 --> 33:52.555
and do you think
she could be pregnant?

33:52.589 --> 33:55.258
Is there any chance
that Adrian would lie?

33:55.292 --> 33:56.459
Is that what you're asking?

33:56.493 --> 33:58.828
If Adrian is capable
of telling a lie?

33:58.862 --> 34:00.630
No, I know she's capable
of telling a lie,

34:00.664 --> 34:02.832
but why would she tell me
she's pregnant

34:02.866 --> 34:04.500
and then lie
about not being pregnant?

34:04.535 --> 34:07.370
I would assume because she
plans to get an abortion,

34:07.404 --> 34:09.038
and she knows
from past conversations

34:09.072 --> 34:10.540
that you wouldn't be
supportive of that.

34:12.443 --> 34:14.243
She wasn't at school today.

34:16.847 --> 34:20.550
Can I sit next to you
on this-- this bed?

34:20.583 --> 34:22.819
Yeah, I guess.

34:25.054 --> 34:27.123
Grace, I heard Adrian
wasn't at school,

34:27.157 --> 34:29.525
but no one is thinking
she's pregnant

34:29.560 --> 34:31.393
or off getting an abortion.

34:31.428 --> 34:32.728
People don't know.

34:32.763 --> 34:35.231
Maybe people shouldn't know.

34:35.264 --> 34:36.299
Maybe we shouldn't know.

34:36.333 --> 34:37.967
If that's
what Adrian did today,

34:38.001 --> 34:39.502
then it's over.

34:39.536 --> 34:41.204
It's between her and God.

34:41.237 --> 34:43.406
It's not for us to judge.

34:43.440 --> 34:44.739
I really believe that.

34:44.775 --> 34:46.509
So we're too late?

34:46.543 --> 34:48.811
Maybe.

34:48.846 --> 34:50.513
I mean, if she did lie

34:50.547 --> 34:51.746
and she was pregnant

34:51.782 --> 34:53.748
and she did get an abortion,

34:53.784 --> 34:56.152
but we don't know
that that's what happened,

34:56.186 --> 34:57.854
and if she wants to tell us
that that's what happened,

34:57.888 --> 34:58.888
then she'll tell us,

34:58.922 --> 35:00.723
and if she doesn't tell us,

35:00.757 --> 35:02.492
then we leave it at that.

35:02.526 --> 35:03.860
Maybe some day she will.

35:03.894 --> 35:04.961
I think, in the meantime,

35:04.995 --> 35:06.929
all we can do is be there
for her

35:06.964 --> 35:08.097
and not be judgmental

35:08.131 --> 35:09.932
so that if one day she wants
to talk about it,

35:09.967 --> 35:11.133
she'll talk about it,

35:11.168 --> 35:13.703
and if she doesn't,
she doesn't.

35:13.737 --> 35:16.239
I think that's the best way
to be a friend to her now.

35:19.943 --> 35:21.777
This okay?

35:21.812 --> 35:23.846
Yeah, I guess.

35:30.153 --> 35:31.821
Look, even if you and I
want to argue

35:31.855 --> 35:32.922
about everything else
in our lives,

35:32.956 --> 35:34.290
we still need to be
on the same page

35:34.324 --> 35:35.625
when it comes
to Amy and Ashley.

35:35.659 --> 35:37.426
And Robbie.
And Robbie.

35:37.461 --> 35:39.595
You forgot about Robbie.
No, I did not forget
about Robbie.

35:39.630 --> 35:41.264
And the dog.
You forgot about Moose.

35:41.298 --> 35:42.865
Don't be ridiculous.
Who's being ridiculous?

35:42.900 --> 35:44.767
You told Ashley she
doesn't have to go to school.

35:44.801 --> 35:47.803
No, I told her that it was
her responsibility to go
to school.

35:47.838 --> 35:49.505
It's against the law
for her not to go to school.

35:49.540 --> 35:50.873
And who do you think
would get in trouble

35:50.908 --> 35:52.241
for breaking that law--
her or us?

35:52.276 --> 35:54.844
She's going to go to school.
What's the penalty?

35:54.878 --> 35:56.279
You don't want to find out,
young lady.

35:58.882 --> 36:00.249
What is the penalty?

36:00.284 --> 36:01.517
I don't know.

36:01.552 --> 36:03.386
I think they just make you go
to school.

36:03.420 --> 36:06.022
That's our job.
She was next door all day,

36:06.056 --> 36:08.157
and you saw her and you just
let her stay over there
with Adrian.

36:08.191 --> 36:09.458
Adrian's a bad influence.

36:09.493 --> 36:11.861
You're the one that sold
the house to her parents.

36:11.895 --> 36:13.229
Oh, I get it.

36:13.263 --> 36:14.363
You're doing this
to get back at me.

36:14.398 --> 36:15.431
You're still mad about Cindy.

36:15.465 --> 36:17.833
No, I'm not... or I wasn't.

36:17.868 --> 36:19.068
Thanks for bringing it up.

36:20.571 --> 36:21.571
Guess what.

36:21.605 --> 36:23.873
What?
What?

36:25.108 --> 36:26.342
Something going on?

36:26.376 --> 36:27.810
You might want to take
John in the nursery

36:27.844 --> 36:29.312
unless you want him to learn
some new words.

36:29.346 --> 36:30.813
Where were you today?

36:30.847 --> 36:32.882
Apparently that's
no one's business but mine.

36:32.916 --> 36:34.383
What's she talking about?

36:34.418 --> 36:35.718
Nothing, Amy.

36:35.752 --> 36:36.886
What is it
that you want to tell us?

36:36.920 --> 36:40.189
Chinese food?
Takeout?

36:40.223 --> 36:41.290
I invited Ben.

36:41.325 --> 36:42.458
Maybe you should un-invite him.

36:42.492 --> 36:45.127
[sighs]
I'll be right back.

36:45.162 --> 36:46.896
Maybe we should move
out again, Ashley and me.

36:46.930 --> 36:47.997
No thanks.

36:48.031 --> 36:49.332
Why would she want to move out?

36:49.366 --> 36:51.100
She's practically got
her own apartment here.

36:51.134 --> 36:52.535
It's a great place to have sex,
don't you think?

36:52.569 --> 36:53.903
It's my fault
she wants to have sex

36:53.937 --> 36:55.504
because I turned the garage
into a room for her?

36:55.539 --> 36:57.173
Oh, and you got her
birth control pills.

36:57.207 --> 36:58.808
Don't forget
the birth control pills.

36:58.842 --> 37:01.510
Would you two
please stop fighting.

37:01.545 --> 37:02.812
It's my first night
back with Ben,

37:02.846 --> 37:04.614
and I want it to be special,

37:04.648 --> 37:07.016
the dinner I would've had
if I went out with Ben.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.651
Isn't this a school night?

37:08.685 --> 37:10.553
Why is your first concern
dinner and Ben?
Don't you have any homework?

37:10.587 --> 37:12.588
Oh, and if you do, Amy,
it's up to you whether
or not you do it.

37:12.623 --> 37:14.156
Those are the new rules.
What?

37:14.191 --> 37:15.391
Those are not the new rules.

37:15.425 --> 37:17.460
<i>[knock on door]</i>

37:22.532 --> 37:24.934
<i>- Hi, Amy.
- Hi.</i>

37:24.968 --> 37:26.002
<i>Hi.</i>

37:26.036 --> 37:27.770
<i>- Yeah.
- Hi.</i>

37:33.377 --> 37:36.112
And so it begins.

37:56.700 --> 37:59.168
Can it keep track of your
mileage, running times,

37:53.183 --> 37:55.718
Oh, goodness, look at the time... 6:15.

37:55.752 --> 37:57.286
I better get going.
I'll walk you out.

37:57.321 --> 38:00.656
Thanks.

38:00.691 --> 38:02.024
The dinner was delicious.

38:02.059 --> 38:03.893
I loved
the General So's chicken

38:03.927 --> 38:05.394
We'll let him know.

38:06.463 --> 38:09.165
- Good night.
- Good night.

38:17.107 --> 38:18.674
I'm so sorry.

38:18.709 --> 38:20.176
Oh, no-no, that's okay.

38:20.210 --> 38:21.878
I don't mind eating
in silence,

38:21.912 --> 38:24.013
especially
after all the screaming.

38:24.047 --> 38:25.982
This is so embarrassing.

38:26.016 --> 38:27.650
Hey, this is something
we'll probably laugh about

38:27.684 --> 38:28.718
in years to come.

38:28.752 --> 38:31.153
And you know what, Amy?
All families argue,

38:31.188 --> 38:33.890
maybe not as enthusiastically
as this one,

38:33.924 --> 38:35.992
but families argue,
my family, too,

38:36.026 --> 38:37.660
and we will, too,

38:37.694 --> 38:40.129
because all families
have problems,

38:40.163 --> 38:43.132
and all families find
a way of working
through their problems,

38:43.166 --> 38:44.734
and that's
how they stay together.

38:44.768 --> 38:46.469
They find a way,

38:46.503 --> 38:49.805
and there's always
a way, always.

38:49.840 --> 38:52.341
Do we have a problem?

38:52.376 --> 38:54.277
Do we have a problem?
What?

38:54.311 --> 38:57.046
I don't know.
Just something about
the way you said that,

38:57.080 --> 38:59.115
like you wanted me
to know something.

38:59.149 --> 39:02.451
No, I just want you to know
that I love you.

39:02.486 --> 39:04.620
I love you, too.

39:05.756 --> 39:07.757
And I'll always love you
no matter what.

39:07.791 --> 39:11.460
Okay, what does that mean?
Why are you saying that?

39:11.495 --> 39:15.831
Well, just because
that's what people say,

39:15.866 --> 39:19.001
but I will always love you.

39:19.036 --> 39:20.269
Good night, Amy.

39:20.304 --> 39:23.072
Good night.

39:41.058 --> 39:44.594
I-- I got accepted
into a summer program

39:44.628 --> 39:47.029
at the Nabokoff School Of Music
in New York.

39:48.765 --> 39:50.333
Help me get into Juilliard.

39:50.367 --> 39:52.001
You should go.

40:01.878 --> 40:03.579
Hey, there you are.

40:03.614 --> 40:05.247
I was just leaving you a note.

40:05.282 --> 40:07.817
The flight got in early,
and Betty and I want to have
dinner with you.

40:07.851 --> 40:09.885
Oh, uh, well, welcome back,

40:09.920 --> 40:13.189
but I just had dinner
with Amy and her family

40:13.223 --> 40:14.890
at their house.

40:14.925 --> 40:17.693
And you're back at 6:30?

40:17.728 --> 40:19.228
Yeah, they eat early.

40:19.262 --> 40:20.529
I'll say.

40:23.734 --> 40:26.168
Something bad happen
at dinner?

40:26.203 --> 40:27.403
Huh?

40:27.437 --> 40:29.338
You look like there's
something wrong.

40:30.007 --> 40:31.574
Well, kind of,

40:31.608 --> 40:33.676
but you go
to dinner with Betty,

40:33.710 --> 40:34.977
and we can talk
when you get back.

40:35.012 --> 40:36.312
This can wait.

40:36.346 --> 40:38.581
Oh, I've got time.

40:38.615 --> 40:40.116
Tell me what's going on.

40:43.186 --> 40:44.487
Oh, come on.

40:44.521 --> 40:45.855
How bad can it be?

40:45.889 --> 40:48.224
[sighs]
Bad.

40:48.258 --> 40:50.593
Ben, whatever it is,
you can tell me.

40:50.627 --> 40:52.795
I'm your dad.
I love you.

40:55.499 --> 40:57.099
You wrecked the car?

40:58.702 --> 41:01.370
You had a little party?
Somebody broke a lamp?

41:03.573 --> 41:05.474
Oh, come on, Ben.

41:05.509 --> 41:07.743
I can't picture you
ever doing anything so bad

41:07.778 --> 41:10.012
you couldn't tell me.

41:10.047 --> 41:11.847
There's nothing you can do

41:11.882 --> 41:14.517
that can't be fixed
somehow, someway.

41:14.551 --> 41:15.985
It's funny you say that

41:16.019 --> 41:17.553
because that's--

41:17.587 --> 41:19.889
that's kind of
what I'm afraid of.

41:20.957 --> 41:24.260
That this is going to get fixed
somehow, someway.

41:26.968 --> 41:32.041
Adrian's pregnant...
and it's my baby.
