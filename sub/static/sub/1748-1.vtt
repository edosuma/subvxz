33:46.320 --> 33:47.500
This was a Helmet.

33:47.600 --> 33:48.620
It was alone.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.460
Which, if you know anything
at all about Helmets,

33:50.560 --> 33:52.340
is quite unusual for that breed.

33:52.440 --> 33:53.820
It was sitting on one of the bags

33:53.920 --> 33:56.300
trying to get at whatever was in there.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.940
I just fished them both
out after I was done

33:58.040 --> 33:59.300
with the mowing and threw them away.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.726
MATTHEW: You didn't open them?

34:01.640 --> 34:05.140
No. I figured it was all
just some waterlogged trash

34:05.240 --> 34:08.060
that kids had thrown in
there the night before.

34:08.159 --> 34:09.860
They do that, you know?

34:09.960 --> 34:12.367
Throw their rubbers and their
empties into the pond.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.820
You see the cops across the street?

34:15.920 --> 34:17.659
Yeah, but I didn't make that connection

34:17.760 --> 34:20.219
until Vince came running over
from the Fifth Avenue entrance.

34:20.320 --> 34:21.699
Vince.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.739
Yeah, he's the other groundskeeper.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.300
He's the one that found
the bags over there.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.460
Is Vince around?
I'd like to talk to him.

34:27.560 --> 34:28.761
He quit.

34:29.239 --> 34:31.010
He opened one of the bags.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.679
You know, I was just starting
to forget about her.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.820
Thank you so much for
bringing that all back.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.179

36:15.920 --> 36:17.460
Yo, Matt, what's the dealie, man?

36:17.560 --> 36:18.500
Hello, TJ.

36:18.600 --> 36:19.660
You know I been shadowing you.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.820
No kidding.

36:20.920 --> 36:23.460
Aiight. So, "I followed subject back

36:23.560 --> 36:25.649
"from dinner to a meeting
at some church."

36:25.920 --> 36:27.485
Used to drink some, huh?

some shitty-assed building on 45th

"where subject remained until..."

36:33.680 --> 36:35.450
I know where I was, TJ.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.700
You made me at that
flower shop, didn't you?

36:38.800 --> 36:40.660
I made you back at the subway.

36:40.760 --> 36:41.860
Damn.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.860
This book I'm reading
says a foot tail is hard

to do on account of
they're so easy to spot.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.140
That it is.

36:47.240 --> 36:48.820
It says it's good to use three guys.

36:48.920 --> 36:51.340
Two alternating behind and another
guy on the other side of the street.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.290
Sure. If you have three guys.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.380
You know you spend a lot of time

36:55.480 --> 36:57.540
at churches and you use
a lot of payphones.

36:57.640 --> 36:58.980
So?

36:59.080 --> 37:00.380
So you don't got no cell phone?

37:00.480 --> 37:01.460
I don't like them.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.660
You don't like computers and
you don't like cell phones.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.486
Fucking Amish got more flavor
than you do, Matthew.

37:07.160 --> 37:08.660
You know, I watched
you follow some dude,

37:08.760 --> 37:10.180
you didn't even try to hide or nothing.

37:10.280 --> 37:11.780
He wasn't looking for me.

37:11.880 --> 37:14.481
Funny. Me following you while
you following some other guy.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.691
It's real ironical.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.140
- TJ?
- Yeah?

37:28.240 --> 37:29.521
Stop following me.

My name is Matt Scudder.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.580
I was wondering if I could talk
to you about your fiancée?

37:44.680 --> 37:46.820
- Fiancée?
- Leila Andresen?

37:46.920 --> 37:48.540
Oh. Leila. Um...

37:48.640 --> 37:50.380
You know, I kind of have this
other place I have to be...

37:50.480 --> 37:51.761
I'll just be a minute.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.881
Yeah, okay.

37:55.520 --> 37:56.721
Yeah, come on in.

37:58.520 --> 38:00.060
I get you something to drink?

38:00.160 --> 38:01.771
No, thank you.

38:03.240 --> 38:06.569
It must be nice, have the time to
work out in the middle of the day.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.100
REUBEN: I'd rather be working.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.880
Period. I'm an actor.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.300
Yeah, I thought you looked familiar.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.220
Have I seen something you've been in?

38:15.320 --> 38:17.020
Maybe. I did a Stetson commercial.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.100
Few years back.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.140
Stetson, the hat?

No, the cologne.

38:20.760 --> 38:23.220
- Oh.
- Ran during the Stanley Cup Finals.

38:23.320 --> 38:24.965
Missed that one.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.083
Leila went to Brooklyn College,
is that right?

38:29.200 --> 38:30.460
Studied decorating?

38:30.560 --> 38:32.091
Interior design.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.401
Right.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.980
You told the police that
it was three men took her.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.100
Yeah, that's right.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.420
You're sure about that?

38:39.520 --> 38:41.449
Yeah. I saw them.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.460
I was at this coffee
place on Prospect...

38:44.560 --> 38:46.660
She used to meet me there sometimes.

38:46.760 --> 38:50.123
...when I see two guys jump
out of the van and grab her.

38:52.320 --> 38:53.521
What'd they look like?

38:53.720 --> 38:55.100
I couldn't really see their faces.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.607
But I could see a third
guy behind the wheel.

38:59.600 --> 39:00.801
Move!

39:01.400 --> 39:03.728
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.201
That's the last time I saw her.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.646

39:10.920 --> 39:13.407
Yeah. You should see
the bedroom, it's...

39:14.720 --> 39:16.604
Wait, I... That didn't sound right.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.460
You don't deal, do you, Reuben?

39:19.560 --> 39:21.180
- What?
- You heard me.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.500

39:22.600 --> 39:24.211
Unless you prefer trafficker.

- Yeah.

42:54.800 --> 42:57.606
You gave the cops a
different address, didn't you?

That's why they never put you
across the street from Leila.

go down and talk, have a cup of coffee.

now with that big fucking knife?

43:32.720 --> 43:33.980
How much is it gonna bother you

43:34.080 --> 43:36.647
I take that knife away
and stick it in your neck?

43:37.520 --> 43:38.767
Could you really do that?

43:38.880 --> 43:40.340
Yeah, I really could.

43:40.440 --> 43:42.005
But I'd rather not.

There's this video store near my house.

keep some of the more specialized stuff.

44:46.400 --> 44:48.125
Always came in together.

44:49.600 --> 44:52.280
You wouldn't really notice
them unless they spoke to you.

44:52.720 --> 44:56.129
One of them had a beard, or a goatee.

44:56.760 --> 45:00.009
The other one smiled a lot.
He did all the talking.

45:00.520 --> 45:01.721
What about names?

You don't exchange names
in a place like that.

45:05.560 --> 45:06.841
Not real ones anyway.

45:07.280 --> 45:10.860
They loved that I worked in a cemetery.
Thought it was funny.

45:10.960 --> 45:12.161
Wanted to buy me drinks.

in the middle of the day.

But they had one of those
police radios, you know?

45:44.320 --> 45:46.180
One of those handheld units.

45:46.280 --> 45:49.780
And they had all these files on drug
dealers with DEA stamps on them.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.969
Told me they worked on
special assignments.

45:52.200 --> 45:53.526
You told them about Reuben.

45:53.960 --> 45:56.128
I told them about Leila.

About how I wanted to
save her from Reuben.

Well, you better pick one,
or I'm going to take them both.

You trying to stall?

46:56.440 --> 46:57.801

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:19.220
Really? They go around saying
they're on the DEA payroll.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:22.220
Usually right before they chop
someone into little pieces.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.180
Was Gotteskind looking at Kenny Kristo?

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.481
I can't answer that.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.484
Maybe Mrs. Kristo can.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.685
Although we haven't seen her
around for a while, have we, guys?

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:35.060
I know, maybe you should
talk to the brother, Peter.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.761
Seeing as he used to spend
a lot of time over there.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.921

- Oh.

You and Carrie put the DEA
onto your brother, didn't you?

Hey.

I wouldn't blame you for
hating the guy. I mean,

has a beautiful wife,

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.340
it's not just that he's
got all that money,

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.980
while you work some
get-well job making donuts.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.248
What would really get me

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.900
is how he can be around all that junk

About nine months ago, they go
to Bermuda for their anniversary.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.927
Carrie asked me to watch the house.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.646
I'm there maybe a day.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.580
Found some cash Kenny hadn't locked up.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.220
I don't even think about it.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.561
And you get busted?

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.924
Yeah. I get put in a room
with this woman DEA agent.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.729
She's so nice to me, you know.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.245
I give Kenny up like that.

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.927
Of course, it didn't help that
you were in love with his wife.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.850
Sometimes I think Kenny left
that money out on purpose.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.966

Yeah. I'm sure that's what he did.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.260
I'm sure this is all exactly
what he wanted to happen.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.700
What are you talking about?

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.480
That agent that busted you,
the nice one,

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.403
her name was Marie Gotteskind.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.323
She was killed by the same
two men who got Carrie.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.481
How did they know about that...
They stole her files.

But he was also out in the rain.

He's got sickle cell anemia.

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:25.648
That's why it has to be your decision.

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:30.203
Well, I guess I just made it.

01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:34.211
Take it easy, Matt.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.201
MATTHEW: Come on.

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:55.171
You know I could help
you with that hand.

01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:58.761
Could you?

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:00.967
(GROANS)

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:11.820
Shelter's gonna be closed.
Wait for me back at my place.

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.100
Where are you going?

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.481
Just do as I say.

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:29.260
SARAH: Step 10.
Continue to take personal inventory.

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:32.325
And when we were wrong,
promptly admitted it.

01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:34.321
Step 11.

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:37.002
Sought through prayer and meditation

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:41.060
to improve our conscious contact
with God as we understand him.

01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:43.300
Praying only for the
knowledge of his will

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.171
for us and the power to carry that out.

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:52.721
Step 12. Having had a spiritual
awakening as the result of these steps,

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:56.060
we try to carry this
message to alcoholics

01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:59.842
and to practice these
principles in all our affairs.

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.404

I just wanted to...
