01:20.940 --> 01:22.100
What?

01:23.020 --> 01:24.180
No.

01:27.340 --> 01:29.690
What? Is that now?

01:29.740 --> 01:32.100
Certainly is.

01:33.540 --> 01:37.050
DI Hardy, you must be anticipating
the relief today's court date'll
bring.

01:37.100 --> 01:39.130
It's the plea and case management
hearing.

01:39.180 --> 01:41.570
But you're pleased you got the right
man in the dock?

01:41.620 --> 01:45.140
What sort of a question is that?
Pleased? Is that how you train him?

01:54.500 --> 01:56.860
Take it if you want.

01:58.820 --> 02:01.180
Right -

02:07.020 --> 02:11.450
Today's hearing is the result of a
thorough investigation by a team of
dedicated officers

02:11.500 --> 02:14.370
who worked day and night under
difficult circumstances.

02:14.420 --> 02:19.410
~ And how will you personally feel
seeing Joe Miller again? ~ No. Don't
do that. It's not about me.

02:19.460 --> 02:23.050
He's the husband of your old
detective sergeant. You must want
the same as us,

02:23.100 --> 02:26.820
Joe Miller sentenced for what he
did. As soon as that happens, we can
all move on.

02:27.860 --> 02:30.450
You know I can't comment
in advance of today.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.050
Are you missing being on active duty
as a detective?

02:33.100 --> 02:36.900
~ You can probably stop taking the
arsehole pills, Oliver. ~ I thought you
might leave.

02:38.140 --> 02:43.170
~ Now that you don't have any
reason to be here. ~ All right...
picture.

02:43.220 --> 02:45.580
If you just stand there.

02:48.620 --> 02:53.700
~ Here? Really?
~ Yeah. That cliff fall's recent.
They're getting more frequent.

02:54.820 --> 02:58.220
~ Things fall apart.
~ It'd help if you look up.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.140
Smile!

03:04.260 --> 03:06.620
OK. Perfect.

03:10.380 --> 03:13.410
~ How's Tom getting on? ~ Me and Mum are
trying to get him through it

03:13.460 --> 03:15.650
but he still doesn't want to be with
Ellie...

03:15.700 --> 03:16.860
Have you seen her?

03:19.460 --> 03:21.820
You?

03:50.740 --> 03:53.610
~ I'm really sorry. I didn't realise-
~ You were speeding.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.730
I've got a hospital appointment.

03:55.780 --> 03:59.530
Biopsy results. My last
meeting, it ran over.

03:59.580 --> 04:01.940
Of course it did.

04:02.740 --> 04:05.170
Look, here's my appointment card.

04:05.220 --> 04:07.010
(Come on, give him a break.)

04:07.060 --> 04:09.420
Licence, please.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.700
Round here, we give people a chance.

04:24.820 --> 04:30.180
Lord, give us the strength so that
we may deal with this day
of challenges.

04:30.740 --> 04:34.060
Give us the wisdom so that we may
choose the correct path.

04:36.580 --> 04:42.500
And grant us compassion to understand
the impact our actions have on
others.

04:47.660 --> 04:51.460
We stand now at a crossroads and ask
that you guide us out
of the darkness...

04:52.860 --> 04:54.100
and into light...

04:57.060 --> 04:58.660
.. in your forgiveness and mercy.

05:00.860 --> 05:03.860
Guide us on the path to redemption,
under your gaze...

05:09.540 --> 05:11.900
Amen.

05:15.420 --> 05:17.780
You need to go.

05:18.820 --> 05:21.860
~ Do they know about you coming here?
~ No-one knows.

05:25.540 --> 05:27.900
Be strong today, Joe.

05:37.060 --> 05:39.460
~ Is it working? ~ Not exactly.

05:41.220 --> 05:45.610
~ Pressure's not strong enough.
~ So, fix it. If this pool isn't full
and I'm mid-contractions...

05:45.660 --> 05:47.930
~ They got a pool at the hospital.
~ Don't you start.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.570
I'm having an home birth, Nige.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.810
All right, Nige. You get it going?

05:51.860 --> 05:54.220
Not really.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.850
Let's get you a top-class pump, eh?

05:56.900 --> 05:58.130
Cheers.

05:58.180 --> 06:00.770
~ Where've you been? ~ Just doing stuff.
You know.

06:00.820 --> 06:03.180
No.

06:04.780 --> 06:07.300
We need to get going.
Get changed, Chlo.

06:42.380 --> 06:44.580
What's the thing to say? Good luck?

06:51.140 --> 06:53.010
Mr Miller, Abby Thompson.

06:53.060 --> 06:54.690
Yeah, I remember you.

06:54.740 --> 06:57.290
Anything I need to know NOT covered
by the case files?

06:57.340 --> 06:59.650
~ No. ~ Good.

06:59.700 --> 07:04.010
Once the plea is entered, you'll be
remanded back into custody for
sentence.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.420
See you in a minute.

07:20.860 --> 07:23.730
Do you have any comments on the case
reopening?

07:23.780 --> 07:25.780
Can we get a picture, please?

07:48.700 --> 07:50.500
Good morning. How are we?

07:52.660 --> 07:56.450
It's a simple hearing. Once he's
entered a plea, he'll be remanded
for sentencing.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.650
The judge will ask for psychiatric
reports and we'll submit the victim
impact statements.

08:00.700 --> 08:03.930
The court's at the top of the stairs
and I'll talk to you after.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.260
OK.

08:07.140 --> 08:09.170
~ You didn't have to be here today.
~ Oh, we did.

08:09.220 --> 08:12.730
~ I need to hear him say it. ~ 'All
parties in Miller to court one.

08:12.780 --> 08:15.300
All parties in Miller to court one.'

08:58.700 --> 09:01.060
You're kidding me...

09:03.580 --> 09:05.020
Just leave it, Beth.

09:06.700 --> 09:09.060
Thank you.

09:13.100 --> 09:16.420
~ Sorry, Crown versus Miller?
~ Up the stairs. Courtroom one.

09:17.460 --> 09:18.820
Sorry.

09:42.020 --> 09:43.780
Miller.

09:44.300 --> 09:47.050
~ I didn't think she'd have the nerve.
~ All right, Beth.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.820
~ What? ~ Now let's just see this
through, all right?

09:53.500 --> 09:55.860
~ How's Devon? ~ Awful.

10:03.900 --> 10:07.300
~ (Hiya.) ~ Er, members of the public
this way, madam. Thank you.

10:08.620 --> 10:11.180
Da-da-da-da-da. Out, now, come on.

10:15.980 --> 10:19.010
What are you doing here? You know how
important today is.

10:19.060 --> 10:22.610
~ Sorry, I was worried you turned your
phone off. ~ You cannot be here -

10:22.660 --> 10:24.970
~ Sorry, I'm panicking, I didn't know
what to do. ~ Go.

10:25.020 --> 10:28.050
I think he's back and I think he's
looking for me.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.570
What?

10:29.620 --> 10:31.530
No, he's not. He can't be.

10:31.580 --> 10:35.450
~ I'd know. Why do you think that?
~ Nine missed calls on my phone.
Number withheld.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.090
~ That doesn't mean-
~ It's him.

10:37.140 --> 10:38.940
It's not. You need to calm down.

10:40.820 --> 10:43.330
I know where he is. I've
had a trace on him.

10:43.380 --> 10:45.100
He's not even in the country.

10:46.180 --> 10:48.890
You'd better be sure, Alec, cos I
feel like I can't breathe-

10:48.940 --> 10:52.770
Everything is fine. Stay calm. Stop
worrying. Soon as I'm done here, I'll
come over.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.650
Now, go home. Please.

10:54.700 --> 10:57.060
It's all fine.

10:58.220 --> 11:00.580
Maybe use the back exit.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.460
Who was that?

11:08.620 --> 11:09.780
All rise.

11:23.060 --> 11:25.420
All parties in the case of
Joseph Miller.

11:56.580 --> 11:58.940
Don't you look at me.

12:01.660 --> 12:04.020
Are you Joseph Michael Miller?

12:05.900 --> 12:12.410
~ Yes. ~ Joseph Michael Miller, you are
charged with murder contrary
to common law.

12:12.460 --> 12:18.650
The particulars of the offence are
that on the 18th day of July 2013,

12:18.700 --> 12:25.180
you murdered Daniel Latimer of 4
Spring Close, Broadchurch, Dorset.

12:26.300 --> 12:29.620
How do you plead?
Guilty or not guilty?

12:33.060 --> 12:34.860
~ Not guilty. ~ No.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.660
He can't.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.010
Er... Your Honour...

12:50.060 --> 12:53.530
Sorry. Erm... Can I just ask for
the indictment to be put again?

12:53.580 --> 12:56.330
Be a man, Joe!
You know what happened!

12:56.380 --> 12:58.970
Sit down.

12:59.020 --> 13:01.340
I said sit down.

13:03.420 --> 13:08.090
I take it from your reaction, Ms
Thompson, that Queen's Counsel have
not been instructed.

13:08.140 --> 13:12.490
~ Very much not, Your Honour.
~ Could you confirm your plea,
Mr Miller?

13:12.540 --> 13:15.780
Not least, it seems
for the benefit of your own counsel.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.660
Not guilty.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.410
It's occupied!

13:40.460 --> 13:42.540
I know. Come out, Miller.

13:43.980 --> 13:46.730
~ Go away! It's the ladies! You can't
come in! ~ You've been ages.

13:46.780 --> 13:49.580
Oi! There's a sign. Cleaning in
progress. Out! Out!

13:57.300 --> 14:01.060
~ Don't let it get to you. ~ Oh, thanks
for that. Brilliant advice.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.330
God. You caught Joe...

14:05.380 --> 14:09.650
He had Danny's phone, you brought
him in, you interviewed him. He
didn't resist. He is guilty.

14:09.700 --> 14:13.610
And the case against him is strong.
The CPS never had any
doubt about prosecuting.

14:13.660 --> 14:17.460
Doesn't he know what it's gonna do
to Beth and Mark? To all of us?

14:18.540 --> 14:22.890
~ Who will tell Tom? He's at school.
If his friends find out before
him... ~ I spoke to your sister.

14:22.940 --> 14:27.740
~ She and Olly are going to take him
out at lunchtime. ~ I could go with
them. I could see him.

14:28.740 --> 14:30.660
You know he doesn't want that.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.730
I'm his mother.

14:33.780 --> 14:37.820
He's only gonna blame me more. How
am I ever gonna get him back if
there's a trial?

14:42.100 --> 14:44.460
How is this my life now?

14:45.860 --> 14:47.660
I'm sorry.

14:53.300 --> 14:55.170
~ Do you want a... hug? ~ What? No!
~ No.

14:55.220 --> 14:58.290
~ What's the matter with you? ~ I want
to help. ~ Hug it out? ~ People do that.

14:58.340 --> 15:00.210
~ Well, not you.
~ Try not to be alone today.

15:00.260 --> 15:04.010
~ I am alone, sir. ~ You don't have to
call me sir any more. ~ I know.

15:04.060 --> 15:07.050
Christ's sake!
Did you put that there?

15:07.100 --> 15:09.210
So, what happens now?

15:09.260 --> 15:11.420
It's a full trial, I'm afraid.

15:12.260 --> 15:14.090
I don't believe this.

15:14.140 --> 15:17.610
We need to make sure the CPS find
you the best QC, which
erm... might be tricky.

15:17.660 --> 15:19.290
You CAN get us someone, can't you?

15:19.340 --> 15:22.420
I know who you want but...
you won't get her.

15:23.260 --> 15:25.300
She hasn't taken a brief in such a
long time.

15:26.180 --> 15:29.570
She's the best there is, she
lives locally, she's CPS approved...

15:29.620 --> 15:33.260
~ I know who you mean. ~ So, how do we
get her to say yes to us?

15:34.300 --> 15:37.810
Did you not see me in here
five minutes before you went
into the dock?

15:37.860 --> 15:40.890
~ Did we not have that conversation?
~ I know. I know. I'm sorry.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.370
I'm here to represent you.
That's the whole point.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.770
You stitched me up.

15:45.820 --> 15:49.780
~ Do you want to tell me what you're
doing? ~ I've had a lot of time to
think, OK?

15:50.820 --> 15:52.780
I can't go to prison for
Danny's death.

15:54.140 --> 15:55.940
Find me someone to take my case.

15:58.940 --> 16:01.570
~ Hey. I've been calling you.
~ Oh, yeah. Sorry, sorry.

16:01.620 --> 16:04.010
I just needed a bit of air, collect
my thoughts.

16:04.060 --> 16:07.740
~ Can you believe Joe? What the hell
was he thinking? ~ I really have no
idea.

16:09.580 --> 16:13.650
~ Is everything OK?
~ Yeah, yeah. Look, I'm... I'm not
gonna go straight back.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.540
There's something I need to do.

16:16.100 --> 16:19.340
OK, well, come over later. I'll get
the kitchen to save you something.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.700
~ Bloody hell!
~ Didn't I say?

16:25.900 --> 16:28.090
20 quid, sunshine!

16:28.140 --> 16:29.850
How have I not heard about that?

16:29.900 --> 16:31.570
~ I think he could do better.
~ I dunno.

16:31.620 --> 16:34.860
I think Becca's quite fit.
I mean, I would.

16:35.900 --> 16:40.250
What? Just the once.
You know... to see.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.900
~ Oliver!
~ Right, article done.

16:43.940 --> 16:48.780
Ready to post online and... publish.

16:49.220 --> 16:50.940
~ Sweet.
~ Olly!

16:51.540 --> 16:55.050
What's so sweet about your uncle
being on trial? What about Tom?

16:55.100 --> 16:57.450
Yeah. No, obviously, poor kid.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.810
We should go and pick him up.

16:58.860 --> 17:01.220
I suppose today means I'll have to
give evidence.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.260
Why would you have to give evidence?

17:06.099 --> 17:09.579
I dunno, just thought we all would.
Are we going or not?

17:30.980 --> 17:33.340
Hi.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.250
~ You shouldn't have come earlier.
~ I know. It was stupid.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.660
Yeah, it bloody was.
Don't do that sort of thing.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.490
~ People don't know you're here,
for good reason. ~ I said I was sorry.

17:44.540 --> 17:47.300
It's just I was spooked by those
calls and I...

17:48.540 --> 17:50.900
.. I needed you.

17:53.540 --> 17:56.490
~ We need to stick to what we agreed.
~ Promise me I'm safe, Alec.

17:56.540 --> 17:58.930
~ I've told you. Everything's OK.
~ So, you're staying?

17:58.980 --> 18:02.370
~ No, I've got things I need to do.
~ I don't like being here by myself.

18:02.420 --> 18:05.090
~ Stop worrying.
~ You don't know what he's capable of.

18:05.140 --> 18:07.660
I do. I've got it covered.

18:43.820 --> 18:49.900
It's boiling in here! You've got all
the radiators on. It's
the most gorgeous day.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.890
Oh, for goodness' sake.

18:52.940 --> 18:56.090
Stop it! Leave me alone, will you?

18:56.140 --> 18:58.570
No.

18:58.620 --> 19:01.060
Look at you, marinating in self pity.

19:02.380 --> 19:04.500
I'm not marinating in anything.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.380
I'm listening to a book.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.290
You remember books? Hm?

19:09.340 --> 19:12.330
Some of us can cope with more than
300 words at a time.

19:12.380 --> 19:15.970
You've heard what's happened?
To the Latimers?

19:16.020 --> 19:17.890
Yes.

19:17.940 --> 19:20.050
~ Are they all right?
~ Course they're not.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.930
They've got to go through the
indignity of a full trial.

19:22.980 --> 19:25.820
~ What's he playing at? ~ I don't know
but the family need help.

19:26.700 --> 19:29.060
That's their barrister. Young chap.

19:31.380 --> 19:34.770
~ No. ~ I haven't even said what I want
to say -

19:34.820 --> 19:36.890
I said no. Go away.

19:36.940 --> 19:39.930
They're worried the CPS will fob
them off with just anyone.

19:39.980 --> 19:43.690
~ They're right to be worried but
it's not my problem. ~ Jocelyn!

19:43.740 --> 19:46.930
Don't, Maggie. I'm sure you've
prepared a barnstorming little
speech

19:46.980 --> 19:48.900
but you're getting on,
save your energy.

19:51.100 --> 19:54.130
~ Jocelyn, you know them.
~ Barely.

19:54.180 --> 19:58.250
You know what it means to all of us.
He can't get away with it.

19:58.300 --> 20:02.330
Spare me the sentimental populism.
I get enough of that from your rag.

20:02.380 --> 20:05.380
~ Please! ~ No.
~ Why?

20:11.460 --> 20:14.210
~ You know why.
~ We'd find you a team to help.

20:14.260 --> 20:16.610
You can't just sit here.
The Latimers need you.

20:16.660 --> 20:19.700
Enough violins now.
The answer is no.

20:25.140 --> 20:28.580
Don't bother to close the curtains
and I'm moving the key.

20:34.580 --> 20:39.100
Your dad has let all this paperwork
stack up. I can't concentrate.

20:41.860 --> 20:44.090
All I keep thinking of is Joe Miller.

20:44.140 --> 20:46.260
~ It should be over -
~ I know.

20:47.260 --> 20:50.340
But we all promised each other we
don't let him get to us.

20:51.660 --> 20:56.250
Right. What needs doing? Get your
fat belly out the way and let me
help.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.730
Oh, I know. Look at me, Chlo.

20:58.780 --> 21:01.690
I am so bloody big. I wish it
would just come.

21:01.740 --> 21:03.860
It's stubborn like the rest of us.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.540
This one...

21:07.220 --> 21:10.410
~ It won't replace Danny.
~ Yeah. I know that.

21:16.460 --> 21:17.930
Nige, you all right?

21:17.980 --> 21:19.770
Hi, lovely, is Mark with you?

21:19.820 --> 21:21.260
He's with you, isn't he?

21:22.180 --> 21:24.490
Right, yeah, must be running late
then.

21:24.540 --> 21:26.570
He left hours ago. You not seen him?

21:26.620 --> 21:30.210
Well, no, most likely he's working
on a job that I've forgotten about.

21:30.260 --> 21:32.810
Let me try him on his mobile.

21:32.860 --> 21:36.100
No, erm... I've already given that
a go so don't worry.

21:37.620 --> 21:39.730
'Beth?'

21:39.780 --> 21:42.140
Beth?

21:53.940 --> 21:57.540
'You've reached Mark Latimer.
Leave a message after the beep.'

22:01.300 --> 22:06.290
Three days ago? Lee Ashworth enters
the country three days ago and you're
telling me now?

22:06.340 --> 22:08.940
Have you any -
What is the point of you, Craig?

22:10.260 --> 22:11.820
God's sake!

23:15.260 --> 23:17.810
Yeah, sorry, I'm two minutes away.

23:17.860 --> 23:21.730
Unbelievable. Three
hours there, three hours back,
working all the way,

23:21.780 --> 23:24.650
late night studying in the worst
budget hotel yet,

23:24.700 --> 23:28.330
and then, this bloke changes his plea
to not guilty, in the dock.

23:28.380 --> 23:30.730
Do we need milk?

23:30.780 --> 23:33.570
~ Out with the old.
~ Are you actually tidying?

23:33.620 --> 23:38.570
~ You'll know. Where in God's name are
the teabags? ~ Ran out two days after
our clerk resigned.

23:38.620 --> 23:40.770
He didn't resign, I fired him.

23:40.820 --> 23:43.450
Sharon, he cc'd me into his
resignation email.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.810
So, you knew about the teabags and
you still came back without any?

23:46.860 --> 23:49.220
I'm your junior,
not your office girl.

23:50.220 --> 23:53.210
That Dorset murder. Boy
on the beach last summer.

23:53.260 --> 23:57.010
That's the bloke who changed his plea
in the dock. Needs a QC.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.050
~ Nah, not interested. ~ Read the file.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.650
~ London? ~ West Country.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.970
~ West Country? ~ It'll have profile.
~ I don't want profile.

24:04.020 --> 24:05.620
~ Just look at it. ~ Don't want to.

24:06.540 --> 24:09.610
Our clerk resigned.
What other cases have we got?

24:09.660 --> 24:11.570
We're waiting for the right thing.

24:11.620 --> 24:15.100
This IS the right thing. I looked
through the file on the way up on the
train.

24:15.980 --> 24:19.130
~ There are discrepancies.
~ What sort of discrepancies?

24:19.180 --> 24:20.700
Your sort.

24:21.340 --> 24:24.370
I marked them in the file.
If you look at THAT...

24:24.420 --> 24:27.740
The procedure around that
and the second paragraph of that...

24:28.340 --> 24:29.900
Prosecution looks shaky.

24:30.780 --> 24:35.940
If you defend this, then it shows
people that nothing's been
affected by, you know...

24:37.140 --> 24:39.380
No, I don't know.

24:39.940 --> 24:42.300
I'll get tea bags.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.010
~ How do I feel?
~ About Joe.

24:59.060 --> 25:02.860
Do you mean, do I still fantasise
about beating him with a
hammer until he's dead?

25:03.900 --> 25:06.820
And do I still daydream about that
while I'm making toast?

25:07.900 --> 25:12.060
And thinking how often I'd hit him
before wiping the blood
and the brains off the hammer...

25:14.180 --> 25:17.820
Then do I worry if those thoughts
make me the same as him?

25:19.420 --> 25:21.780
Not as often, no.

25:23.420 --> 25:25.770
And after being in court?

25:25.820 --> 25:29.660
I was doing all right, you know. I
was pressing it down, burying
it...

25:31.380 --> 25:36.540
Cos I taught myself to do that, these
past few months, so I could survive
and then in the court...

25:38.260 --> 25:41.300
.. seeing him and...

25:41.540 --> 25:42.540
him choosing to...

25:45.740 --> 25:51.410
Cos I thought... OK, naive but I
thought he'd plead guilty, he'd get
sentenced and then it'd be done

25:51.460 --> 25:56.260
and then in a few weeks, or a month,
I could go back to my home, to
Broadchurch and...

25:58.100 --> 26:00.650
.. I could cope with
all the glances and the stares

26:00.700 --> 26:03.900
cos justice would have been done and
he wouldn't be coming back.

26:04.860 --> 26:09.770
And then maybe in time, Tom would
want to come and live with me
again...

26:09.820 --> 26:12.180
and we could work that out...

26:14.540 --> 26:16.900
It all seems a long way away now.

26:19.020 --> 26:21.380
And how are you feeling about that?

26:22.900 --> 26:24.460
Guilty.

26:26.300 --> 26:28.740
~ Why? ~ Because it's my fault.

26:36.540 --> 26:39.420
Have you seen Ellie?
How's she doing?

26:41.460 --> 26:45.260
~ What are you playing at, Joe?
~ You're upset I didn't warn you.

26:47.500 --> 26:50.300
I came when you asked for me.
I gave you guidance.

26:51.300 --> 26:52.940
I've prayed with you because I...

26:53.900 --> 26:57.620
~ I thought that you were penitent.
~ I know and I'm grateful.

26:58.900 --> 27:01.380
Joe, you can't put everyone through
a trial.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.300
You confessed.
The evidence against you is clear.

27:07.180 --> 27:09.530
Not just me. Everyone.

27:09.580 --> 27:11.940
Joe, you are the only one on trial
here.

27:12.700 --> 27:15.060
You killed a child.

27:15.580 --> 27:19.820
~ Just you. No-one else. ~ Nobody's
innocent, Paul. Everyone's hiding
things.

27:23.460 --> 27:25.610
Miller.

27:25.660 --> 27:27.930
Go away! What are you doing here?

27:27.980 --> 27:30.610
~ It's your appointment.
~ But I didn't tell anyone.

27:30.660 --> 27:32.330
~ Have you been following me? ~ Shut up!

27:32.380 --> 27:35.850
That's right. Stalk me and insult me
and you wonder why you're divorced.

27:35.900 --> 27:39.170
~ I'm in trouble. ~ So am I, if I don't
collect Fred from
the child minder's.

27:39.220 --> 27:41.810
Seriously.

27:41.860 --> 27:44.220
I sort of need your help.

27:47.380 --> 27:50.540
Get in. For God's sake!

27:55.020 --> 27:57.410
This needs to stay between us.
You need to promise me.

27:57.460 --> 27:59.690
~ How long's this gonna take?
~ Promise me.

27:59.740 --> 28:01.900
~ Am I going to be annoyed by this?
~ Next left.

28:08.300 --> 28:10.660
What's going on? Who's this?

28:11.900 --> 28:13.730
~ Miller, Claire.
~ Ellie. Hi.

28:13.780 --> 28:15.930
~ Why are you bringing someone here?
~ She'll help.

28:15.980 --> 28:19.010
~ No-one's supposed to know. ~ You're
worried. She'll look after you.

28:19.060 --> 28:21.220
~ What?
~ Let's not do this out here. Inside.

28:33.740 --> 28:34.980
Jocelyn?

28:35.980 --> 28:37.890
I'm Beth Latimer. This is Mark.

28:37.940 --> 28:41.050
~ Hi. ~ Maggie bloody Radcliffe!

28:41.100 --> 28:43.250
We just need your help.

28:43.300 --> 28:46.850
Joe Miller has to be convicted.
We're not leaving that to chance.

28:46.900 --> 28:50.250
I'm not practising. I haven't tried
a criminal case in...

28:50.300 --> 28:52.890
in three years and
I'm NOT taking your case.

28:52.940 --> 28:55.050
Yeah but you know this town.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.250
All the people who were affected,
not just us.

28:57.300 --> 29:01.010
How do they carry on if bloody Joe
Miller gets off? If he comes back to
live here?

29:01.060 --> 29:06.980
~ It's not my responsibility.
~ You're right, it's not but we don't
know who else to ask.

29:07.860 --> 29:12.850
And see, me and him, we're different.
I don't care about this town. I care
about Danny.

29:12.900 --> 29:15.010
And about this baby
that I'm about to drop

29:15.060 --> 29:18.410
cos I can't give myself to another
child, when I failed the last one.

29:18.460 --> 29:20.370
~ You didn't fail him.
~ I did! We did!

29:20.420 --> 29:22.930
~ Please stop saying that.
~ We have to get justice.

29:22.980 --> 29:25.410
You have to help us.

29:25.460 --> 29:29.420
I stopped working years ago.
I'm not the person you've heard of.
Just...

29:30.460 --> 29:32.820
Just leave me alone.

29:39.180 --> 29:42.210
~ He's gorgeous! ~ He's quite sleepy.

29:42.260 --> 29:45.060
~ What is he? Two?
~ Nearly. You got kids?

29:47.260 --> 29:48.250
Oh.

29:48.300 --> 29:52.170
~ Sorry. Is she your wife?
~ Him? Please!

29:52.220 --> 29:54.460
~ Not my wife. ~ Do you want to tell me
what's going on?

29:57.660 --> 30:00.130
I trust her.

30:00.180 --> 30:02.780
She can help.

30:04.740 --> 30:07.220
Go on, then. Tell her.
You obviously want to.

30:10.140 --> 30:12.690
It's sort of witness protection.

30:12.740 --> 30:15.730
What? How can you be running
witness protection?

30:15.780 --> 30:17.700
I said, sort of, not officially.

30:18.740 --> 30:23.210
~ But she is under my care.
~ What do you mean 'not officially'?
You've been hiding her here?

30:23.260 --> 30:28.330
~ No-one knows and no-one can know.
~ Are you out of your head? Oh, tell
me you haven't done this.

30:28.380 --> 30:30.860
A witness to what, that you have to
be holed up here?

30:33.300 --> 30:35.460
Tell her.

30:36.620 --> 30:39.260
My last case before I came to
Broadchurch.

30:40.700 --> 30:41.900
Sandbrook.

30:51.700 --> 30:53.420
There were two girls, cousins.

30:54.380 --> 30:58.130
Lisa Newbery, 19, was babysitting for
her 12-year-old cousin Pippa.

30:58.180 --> 31:01.730
Pippa's parents went away for the
night to a friend's wedding.

31:01.780 --> 31:04.450
When they came back the next day,
both girls were gone.

31:04.500 --> 31:08.340
The 12-year-old, Pippa, her body was
found three days later.

31:09.420 --> 31:13.940
The 19-year-old, Lisa...
Officially she's still missing.

31:16.180 --> 31:21.300
Our main suspect was a man called Lee
Ashworth but he had a solid alibi.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.570
~ Which was what? ~ Me.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.980
I said I was with Lee all night.

31:28.820 --> 31:32.020
~ Was that true? ~ No.

31:36.620 --> 31:40.210
No, I was at a friend's house but
Alec worked out that I was lying

31:40.260 --> 31:43.660
and he promised, if I told the
truth, Lee would be convicted.

31:45.660 --> 31:48.660
~ It was a big risk for me. ~ Why?

31:52.220 --> 31:54.210
Lee's my husband.

31:54.260 --> 31:56.620
~ Oh, God! ~ Yeah.

31:58.020 --> 32:01.860
The trial collapsed and Lee walked
a free man and I asked Alec if he
would protect me.

32:03.220 --> 32:06.370
So, that's what this place is all
about. You can't just keep her here.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.370
There are official channels,
procedure.

32:08.420 --> 32:14.060
Not if you've accused the person
who's walked free. There's no
witness protection, there's nothing.

32:14.940 --> 32:16.690
I'd be abandoned
if it wasn't for Alec.

32:16.740 --> 32:19.340
~ How long have you been here?
~ Seven months or so?

32:20.900 --> 32:23.130
No. If you've been here seven
months...

32:23.180 --> 32:26.810
When I came to Broadchurch.
That's WHY I came to Broadchurch.

32:26.860 --> 32:29.570
I took the job so I could keep
Claire safe here.

32:29.620 --> 32:31.540
You wanker!

32:32.660 --> 32:35.610
~ No, Miller, don't! ~ That went well.

32:35.660 --> 32:37.890
~ Fred, darling, we're going.
~ Miller, stop!

32:37.940 --> 32:41.290
~ You took the job earmarked for me
because of her. ~ Get over the bloody
job!

32:41.340 --> 32:44.780
Do you not see how stupid you're
being? What are you thinking?

32:46.340 --> 32:49.380
~ (I've got a plan.)
~ Yeah, well, it's shit! ~ I can solve
Sandbrook.

32:51.220 --> 32:53.980
~ Claire's the key. ~ What if Lee
Ashworth comes looking for her?

32:55.700 --> 32:58.450
~ (I want him to.)
~ That's your plan?

32:58.500 --> 33:00.890
Just stay a bit longer,
get to know Claire.

33:00.940 --> 33:04.730
~ Have dinner, have some drinks, you
can all stay the night.
~ Oh, have a sleepover!

33:04.780 --> 33:07.970
She needs someone like you and
you're not overloaded for friends.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.170
~ Thanks a lot!
~ There's even room here for...

33:10.220 --> 33:12.250
~ Fred!
~ Fred. Please, Miller.

33:12.300 --> 33:15.620
Please, listen, I need to know I got
Sandbrook right in the end.

33:18.380 --> 33:20.100
I can't do it on my own.

33:32.180 --> 33:34.540
~ So, Mr Miller... ~ Joe.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.210
Thanks for coming. There's a lot I
need to tell you.

33:38.260 --> 33:40.060
No. What you need to do is shut up.

33:41.260 --> 33:42.330
Sorry?

33:42.380 --> 33:47.570
I'm looking at these transcripts and
your interview and you've done far
too much talking already.

33:47.620 --> 33:49.810
As your new counsel, my advice is:

33:49.860 --> 33:55.770
don't talk to anyone, don't discuss
the case, keep your mouth shut.

33:55.820 --> 33:57.650
Understand?

33:57.700 --> 33:59.420
You can open your mouth to say yes.

34:00.820 --> 34:01.940
Yes.

34:03.820 --> 34:07.250
I can't spend the rest of my life in
prison, not as a child killer.

34:07.300 --> 34:11.250
~ Promise me you can get me out of
this. ~ I wouldn't be here if I didn't
think I could.

34:11.300 --> 34:15.900
Now, a few questions to start us
off, get things straight.

34:16.980 --> 34:19.770
When you were arrested by DI Hardy,
was he alone?

34:19.820 --> 34:22.260
Did he have other officers with him?

34:23.300 --> 34:25.530
~ He was alone. ~ And how did he take
you into custody?

34:25.580 --> 34:28.530
~ He called for a car.
~ And you waited for the car?

34:28.580 --> 34:32.090
~ Just you and him?
Did you talk to him then? ~ Yes.

34:32.139 --> 34:34.980
~ Did he record the conversation? ~ No.

34:37.260 --> 34:39.530
Now, your wife worked alongside
DI Hardy.

34:39.580 --> 34:42.210
Had you met him outside of work?

34:42.260 --> 34:44.219
He'd been round for dinner.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.780
~ Shall I try him again?
~ I'll do it. You start.

35:11.420 --> 35:14.900
Hey... We're eating.
I thought you said you'd be back.

35:16.260 --> 35:19.300
Hope everything's all right.
Let me know.

35:20.420 --> 35:22.410
~ I'm sure he's fine. ~ Yeah.

35:22.460 --> 35:24.820
What, does he not like being at home
now?

35:26.060 --> 35:32.130
~ They're really busy, him and Nige.
~ 'Joseph Miller was remanded back
into custody

35:32.180 --> 35:38.050
after pleading not guilty here at
Wessex Crown Court to the murder of
11-year-old Daniel Latimer,

35:38.100 --> 35:41.740
whose body was found on the beach
at Broadchurch, in Dorset.

35:43.180 --> 35:49.090
Sharon Bishop, QC, representing Mr
Miller, tonight maintained her
client's innocence.'

35:49.140 --> 35:52.290
~ No. No, don't. ~ Mr Miller vehemently
denies the charge against him

35:52.340 --> 35:55.300
and is looking forward to defending
himself in a court of law.

35:56.300 --> 36:01.260
~ That's really not fair.
~ '.. from here at Wessex Crown Court.
Now to the studio.'

36:16.500 --> 36:19.380
Can he handle the pressure?
He steps up.

36:20.900 --> 36:25.050
~ Straight down the middle!
~ That was never a penalty!
~ You shouldn't have tripped him up.

36:29.940 --> 36:32.860
It's Aunt Lucy. I better get back.

36:33.700 --> 36:37.260
17 games to 14 in my favour.
You're just as good as Dan.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.620
~ Tomorrow, again? ~ Definitely.

36:42.420 --> 36:47.660
~ You sure no-one has this place?
~ Yeah. The woman who let me borrow
her keys just disappeared.

36:48.580 --> 36:50.730
What do you mean, disappeared?
Where is she?

36:50.780 --> 36:53.130
I came back one day
and she was gone.

36:53.180 --> 36:55.540
I've still got the keys.

36:55.780 --> 36:58.580
It's nice, coming to meet you,
even if you do win at FIFA.

37:02.660 --> 37:05.300
~ Thanks, Mark! ~ See you.

37:19.660 --> 37:22.340
There's extra blankets
in the cupboard, Ellie.

37:31.220 --> 37:33.330
~ You all right in there, Miller?
~ Don't come in!

37:33.380 --> 37:35.290
Course I'm not coming in.
I'm on the sofa.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.700
~ Goodnight.
~ (Fine.) Night.

38:15.660 --> 38:19.130
Don't blame you for coming back here.
It's gorgeous.

38:19.180 --> 38:21.900
You never escape your home.

38:24.180 --> 38:26.540
~ How are you?
~ Like you care (!)

38:28.300 --> 38:32.130
Look. the reason I called,
I'm after some context.

38:32.180 --> 38:34.060
You know that I'm defending
Joe Miller?

38:35.700 --> 38:38.700
Can I ask you a favour? Don't.

38:40.020 --> 38:42.290
~ Why? ~ Why would you want to?

38:42.340 --> 38:45.850
Overwhelming forensic evidence,
admission of guilt.

38:45.900 --> 38:48.170
~ Let someone else do it. ~ Jocelyn.

38:48.220 --> 38:51.170
You haven't been my boss
in a very long time.

38:51.220 --> 38:53.970
No. Course not. I... Yeah.

38:54.020 --> 38:55.820
I should have known. Fine. Fine.

38:56.700 --> 38:59.140
Why are you so bothered, anyway?

39:00.180 --> 39:03.220
~ Because I'll be prosecuting.
~ Yeah, right (!)

39:10.100 --> 39:12.930
You're serious.

39:12.980 --> 39:16.980
~ I'd hate to show up a former pupil.
~ So, you'd do it for them but not
for...

39:22.060 --> 39:24.100
Sure you're up to it?

39:25.940 --> 39:27.860
I'm certain.

39:28.980 --> 39:30.780
See you soon, then.

39:36.660 --> 39:37.900
Bollocks.

39:41.500 --> 39:43.250
OK, thanks. Be there soon as I can.

39:43.300 --> 39:47.290
~ Miller, I need you to drive me. ~ No, I
didn't sleep well, thanks for
asking. Get a taxi.

39:47.340 --> 39:49.410
A taxi'll take too long.
I need to be there now.

39:49.460 --> 39:52.210
~ Get your own car. ~ I can't.

39:52.260 --> 39:54.610
Medically. Can we go?

39:54.660 --> 39:56.820
~ Go where?
~ I'll call you. Miller, come on!

39:57.820 --> 40:01.010
~ See you.
~ Look at you, his little puppy.

40:01.060 --> 40:03.700
Hey, Fred, you going too? Bye-bye!
Come back soon!

40:22.900 --> 40:24.730
~ Oh. Hi. ~ He's got bad news.

40:24.780 --> 40:29.060
Who has? Oh, hi, Ben. Mark,
Jocelyn's here with Ben.

40:29.980 --> 40:32.340
You're taking our case, then?

40:32.980 --> 40:37.700
~ This trial is gonna put more demands
on you. I'll put more demands on
you. ~ We want the truth to come out.

40:38.700 --> 40:42.290
~ Knowing the truth and getting
justice isn't the same thing.
~ We understand that.

40:42.340 --> 40:45.930
No, you really don't. Not if you've
never been through this.

40:45.980 --> 40:50.650
I'll need to know everything about
you, everything about
Danny, everything about the Millers.

40:50.700 --> 40:52.170
Nothing will stay hidden.

40:52.220 --> 40:56.010
Joe Miller has got a tough defence
team. They'll move fast
and fight dirty.

40:56.060 --> 40:59.900
~ In fact, they already are.
~ In what way?

41:03.900 --> 41:07.450
You know the wardrobe
in that bedroom?

41:07.500 --> 41:09.450
I found a letter wrapped in cloth.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.940
Well, I say letter, it was a
bluebell in an envelope.

41:15.580 --> 41:17.250
What do you mean, a bluebell?

41:17.300 --> 41:19.580
Well, just that, a single flower.

41:20.620 --> 41:22.060
This right, here.

41:24.700 --> 41:27.690
~ This is the road to the church.
~ I know.

41:27.740 --> 41:30.820
~ Why are we going to the church?
~ Just let me out and drive away. ~ No!

41:39.940 --> 41:41.610
Tell me they're not going to do
this.

41:41.660 --> 41:44.130
They've got a court order. Ellie.

41:44.180 --> 41:47.300
~ Somebody tell me what's going on.
~ Back in the car, Miller!

41:49.020 --> 41:53.010
Joe's legal team have requested
a new autopsy on Danny's body.

41:53.060 --> 41:56.820
~ It means an official exhumation.
~ Oh, God, no.

42:11.420 --> 42:13.780
Give me that. Give me that.

42:17.980 --> 42:21.420
~ Ellie. ~ My boy is in there!

42:22.220 --> 42:24.820
You! Why can't you let him rest, eh?

42:25.180 --> 42:27.290
~ I'm so sorry.
~ You couldn't resist, could you?

42:27.340 --> 42:31.090
~ I didn't know this was happening ~ No,
you never do. This is on you, Ellie.

42:31.140 --> 42:34.020
I hope you rot in hell
for what you've done to us!

42:35.140 --> 42:37.500
Come on, Mum. Come away.

42:39.340 --> 42:42.180
~ Do something, Paul.
~ I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:43.340 --> 42:45.020
Ey, ey, ey. Come on, eh?

42:58.260 --> 42:59.540
You all right?

43:21.660 --> 43:23.850
~ Who's that?
~ It's Lee Ashworth.

43:23.900 --> 43:25.740
You're kidding.

43:27.100 --> 43:28.940
Look at him standing there gloating.

43:30.380 --> 43:32.940
Why are you so sure
he killed those girls?
