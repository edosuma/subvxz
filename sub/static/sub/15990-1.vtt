00:27.218 --> 00:30.745
- John!
- Nancy, Look out!

00:37.384 --> 00:38.384
Come on!

00:39.171 --> 00:39.974
Come on!

00:45.869 --> 00:47.694
Come on, Nancy. Come on!

01:03.095 --> 01:05.695
{gunshot}

01:19.537 --> 01:22.734
- Dad?
- Sorry son, I could not do it.

01:22.774 --> 01:25.538
You will have to...

01:31.649 --> 01:34.015
pa, pa!

01:34.719 --> 01:36.983
pa!

01:57.441 --> 01:59.068
I love you!

02:58.236 --> 03:01.171
Mr. President,
here she is again.

03:08.846 --> 03:11.007
Father going to be killed.

03:12.149 --> 03:13.844
I'm not in danger, dear.

03:13.885 --> 03:17.878
They hate you, Abraham! Why
have to go to that horrible place?

03:18.756 --> 03:21.520
Because the Battle of Gettysburg
was important...

03:21.559 --> 03:24.392
- And needs to be recognized.
- I do not see why...

03:24.428 --> 03:27.420
There were 50,000 casualties.

03:28.032 --> 03:31.559
It is a tribute to these mass graves
and yes... I must watch.

03:31.602 --> 03:33.467
I was asked to speak.

03:34.205 --> 03:37.800
What they refuse to say
on the bodies of young dead?

03:40.344 --> 03:43.836
I think our victory here
was something that will change the war.

03:44.982 --> 03:47.610
I want to give a message
unifying...

03:48.519 --> 03:50.612
- And hope.
- Hope?

03:50.655 --> 03:52.919
You?

03:52.957 --> 03:57.087
You are the most melancholy man
I have ever known, Mr. Lincoln.

03:57.595 --> 04:00.189
Maybe so.

04:00.231 --> 04:03.598
Mr. President, the Secretary
is waiting downstairs.

04:04.368 --> 04:06.632
Okay...

04:07.071 --> 04:09.164
Fear not, dear.

04:09.407 --> 04:11.602
You'll still have me
for many years.

04:28.459 --> 04:31.792
What is that we can recapitulate
Operation "Big Shanty" was disastrous.

04:32.463 --> 04:35.398
Of the 30 men we send,

04:35.433 --> 04:38.561
only one survived.

04:39.470 --> 04:41.665
And apparently gone mad.

04:42.273 --> 04:44.298
How so?

04:44.809 --> 04:48.472
You are telling stories about...
undead.

04:48.512 --> 04:49.706
And cannibalism.

04:49.747 --> 04:51.544
Clearly crazy.

04:52.350 --> 04:53.510
Men undead?

04:54.352 --> 04:56.286
The union or the confederation?

04:56.320 --> 04:58.254
Of the two, he said.

04:58.289 --> 05:00.018
Or no, I do not know.

05:00.057 --> 05:02.048
Who controls the strong?

05:02.126 --> 05:04.594
No one knows.

05:04.628 --> 05:06.789
We must control the strong.

05:06.831 --> 05:09.425
I've been looking at our options.

05:09.467 --> 05:11.697
Grant remains victorious.

05:11.736 --> 05:14.671
We could have 1,000 troops
ready in a few days.

05:14.705 --> 05:19.369
No... do not want to show
with so many rebels in the fort yet.

05:20.177 --> 05:22.236
We cannot send more men to
understand what is happening?

05:23.180 --> 05:24.875
I need to talk
with this young man.

05:27.451 --> 05:31.148
It has a small scythe in my closet,
she could bring me, please?

05:32.690 --> 05:36.023
This is Mr. John McGill
an old friend.

05:36.827 --> 05:40.263
Frankly, he and my wife
think I'm in danger.

05:40.297 --> 05:43.027
And he insists on accompanying me
everywhere, at all times.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.929
I think you're putting yourself in
danger now, Mr. President.

05:47.405 --> 05:49.498
I can handle myself alone.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.175
I believe there
a certain risk, sir.

05:54.211 --> 05:56.338
I'll take care not to do
harm to the president.

05:58.616 --> 06:01.517
Dr. Mallahoff leads the team
doctor here in the bunker.

06:02.553 --> 06:05.784
- It is an honour to meet you, President.
- How's our patient?

06:06.524 --> 06:10.790
Do not respond to any treatment
and his condition is getting worse every hour.

06:12.296 --> 06:15.288
He is lucid and can
communicate verbally,

06:15.332 --> 06:16.697
but became more violent.

06:16.734 --> 06:19.032
I fear that we have
to tie it.

06:19.070 --> 06:21.095
I understand.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.765
Around here, gentlemen.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.668
Do you know who I am, Captain?

06:35.753 --> 06:37.846
What happened?

06:37.888 --> 06:39.788
Where is the rest
of your patrol?

06:41.125 --> 06:44.856
Dead, all are... dead!

06:45.496 --> 06:47.691
You're the only survivor?

06:49.633 --> 06:52.067
They killed everyone!

06:52.103 --> 06:53.968
Who? The rebels?

06:54.004 --> 06:56.336
You faced the Confederates
in the open?

06:58.008 --> 07:00.772
No... No...

07:01.979 --> 07:03.879
They are also dead.

07:03.914 --> 07:05.905
So against whom
you fought for?

07:09.019 --> 07:10.611
There were so many...

07:11.122 --> 07:13.613
Everywhere

07:14.558 --> 07:19.825
They... in... bite.

07:19.864 --> 07:21.764
E...

07:24.201 --> 07:26.829
I do not understand, Captain.

07:29.406 --> 07:32.239
They ate our meat!

07:34.145 --> 07:37.637
Cannot be killed,
but we have done in pieces!

07:42.620 --> 07:44.485
Who could have done this?

07:45.256 --> 07:49.215
What kind of disease?
Or poison?

07:50.027 --> 07:52.723
The rebels could have done
some kind of weapon,

07:52.763 --> 07:54.890
who steals men
their souls?

07:55.366 --> 07:57.698
What makes them
in demented cannibal?

07:57.735 --> 08:00.704
This is not working
confederation.

08:00.738 --> 08:02.797
And then we
facing what?

08:04.508 --> 08:06.976
Mr. Secretary...

08:07.011 --> 08:11.414
As the new Secret Service...
This is a call to a mission.

08:12.116 --> 08:14.084
- Only...
- Very well.

08:15.553 --> 08:19.216
Ready for a mission
behind enemy lines?

08:19.890 --> 08:22.017
- Sir? - We have
send a small team

08:22.059 --> 08:25.790
the strong Pulaski, to determine
exactly what happened

08:25.829 --> 08:30.425
the operation "Big Shanty", we have
find out how the infection spread.

08:31.235 --> 08:35.068
We must find these men
and we must capture this strong.

08:35.105 --> 08:37.505
Is the same as
the slightest possibility.

08:37.541 --> 08:39.475
I fear not being understood.

08:39.510 --> 08:44.208
If this is what I think is
must be controlled.

08:44.248 --> 08:47.046
Before spreading,
which will be very fast.

08:48.786 --> 08:52.449
If spread more, can
wipe out the population!

08:53.724 --> 08:58.127
And if they become aware, can generate
panic and it would be fatal.

08:58.696 --> 09:02.359
Are you saying that we should send 12
agents behind enemy lines,

09:02.399 --> 09:05.835
against an army that only God
know how many men,

09:05.869 --> 09:07.769
to see what happened
during the war?

09:08.572 --> 09:11.905
- I'm... - Who would lead
such a suicide mission?

09:12.943 --> 09:14.604
I know men and
perfect for this job.

09:22.786 --> 09:24.777
Stay here, Mr. President.

09:45.643 --> 09:49.670
Captain Eckert! We just want your
recovery and well-being, sir!

09:54.051 --> 09:56.110
Captain, stay there!

09:56.654 --> 09:59.145
I do not want to shoot you!

10:01.292 --> 10:04.693
- Edwin, his sword is sharpened
and ready? - Always, President.

10:04.728 --> 10:08.255
Well,
bring my sickle of carriage.

10:45.502 --> 10:47.129
Mr. President!

10:56.747 --> 10:59.079
Now we are seeing
against what we are.

10:59.783 --> 11:03.048
- With the oldest dead...
- No, you cannot go.

11:03.087 --> 11:05.988
- It's impossible! - Yourself
said! A suicide mission!

11:06.023 --> 11:08.218
How could I ask another
man who go in my place?

11:08.258 --> 11:10.852
Need you here,
to lead the war.

11:10.894 --> 11:13.419
The fate of the nation
hangs in the balance.

11:13.464 --> 11:17.195
I think the fate of the nation
is the success of this mission.

11:17.968 --> 11:22.428
What's the point in preserving a
union populated by people like Eckert?

11:22.973 --> 11:26.204
- Yes.. but...
- I think you have knowledge

11:26.243 --> 11:29.144
the disease
that led Eckert.

11:29.179 --> 11:32.080
I am the only one who can
lead the mission.

11:32.116 --> 11:34.676
What you're saying will
against all reason.

11:34.752 --> 11:36.811
Imagine 100 men and Eckert.

11:36.854 --> 11:41.291
Now imagine 1,000 women and
children too, all the same.

11:41.859 --> 11:44.623
This rather goes against reason.

11:45.763 --> 11:49.460
You will tell a story about
where I am and what I'm doing.

11:49.533 --> 11:52.832
Nobody should know
I left the capital.

11:52.870 --> 11:54.531
Not even Mary Todd.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.766
Okay, so we have to go
soon as possible.

12:08.452 --> 12:11.285
Do what the driver stops
the train is coming.

12:11.321 --> 12:14.222
It is the further we
travelling on the train.

12:15.159 --> 12:18.390
Our men took off their
tracks later.

12:22.599 --> 12:25.033
Let's stop here
to breathe a little.

12:25.068 --> 12:28.469
Gentlemen,
I assume that everyone knows...

12:28.505 --> 12:32.771
anaconda plan block
throughout the south, deny access...

12:32.810 --> 12:34.277
the boats and the exchange.

12:35.112 --> 12:39.139
Thanks to the victory of General Grant,
almost have the Mississippi River.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.776
We are virtually cut
the Confederation...

12:42.853 --> 12:45.413
Providing...
weapons and supplies.

12:45.456 --> 12:47.754
Then the whole block
must expand.

12:47.791 --> 12:51.989
The victory should be with minimal
distraction and loss of life.

12:52.029 --> 12:54.259
Now the strong Pulaski

12:54.298 --> 12:57.927
is at a key exchange
near the Savannah River

12:57.968 --> 13:01.529
the Georgia coast,
is something of great importance.

13:02.573 --> 13:08.011
Operation "Big Shanty" disguised
infiltration and capture of the fort,

13:08.045 --> 13:10.445
without a
greater strength.

13:11.315 --> 13:13.374
Well, the mission failed.

13:14.918 --> 13:17.546
It may have been
a disaster.

13:17.588 --> 13:22.082
So we're on a mission to
search and rescue, Mr. President?

13:23.460 --> 13:25.621
Something like that.

13:27.331 --> 13:32.234
Indeed, gentlemen, I hope
recover our lost troops.

13:32.269 --> 13:37.366
But not aver iguei what led to
failure and not completing the mission.

13:38.342 --> 13:39.969
Because the course was
something happened!

13:40.777 --> 13:43.575
Fort Pulaski
must be captured!

13:43.647 --> 13:45.672
For our fallen comrades!

13:46.817 --> 13:49.285
And the success of our mission!

13:54.625 --> 13:57.093
What do you think
leader of this rash?

13:57.127 --> 14:00.119
It is an honour to be with the president
the United States.

14:00.864 --> 14:02.832
It's true.

14:02.866 --> 14:05.198
But you voted for him?

14:05.235 --> 14:08.068
He was a man of Douglas,
like me.

14:08.772 --> 14:12.230
He is the president, and if someone is
that can hold together the nation,

14:12.276 --> 14:14.301
is it.

14:14.344 --> 14:16.141
I wonder
if you can with the task.

14:16.179 --> 14:19.774
It is a brave man, has its
well placed convictions.

14:19.816 --> 14:22.148
I met him.

14:22.185 --> 14:24.449
They want a leader?

14:24.488 --> 14:26.752
I would follow Lincoln
to hell.

14:26.790 --> 14:29.657
- Probably get your chance, my boy
- I'm not your boy

15:14.504 --> 15:18.440
1, 2, 3.

15:43.441 --> 15:45.441
{GUN SHOT}

16:16.898 --> 16:17.961
Stop.

16:26.476 --> 16:28.774
Who's there?

16:28.812 --> 16:30.803
Wait a minute!
Identify yourself.

16:52.335 --> 16:54.803
Mr. President!

17:00.343 --> 17:02.834
Lord!
How could you?

17:14.191 --> 17:15.818
The noise must have attracted him.

17:17.227 --> 17:18.819
Shut it!

17:22.898 --> 17:25.026
Yes, sir!

17:43.653 --> 17:45.985
Throw in the head!

18:46.316 --> 18:49.183
- How is he?
- Not so bad.

18:49.219 --> 18:51.915
The bullet entered and exited
and did not break any bones.

18:51.955 --> 18:54.480
Is injured in another way?
Bitten or scratched?

18:59.062 --> 19:01.087
No... I can see.

19:05.035 --> 19:07.697
Look... someone is injured?

19:08.939 --> 19:12.170
We need to know!
Bitten? Scratched?

19:12.976 --> 19:15.911
His blood has entered its
mouth during the fight?

19:18.215 --> 19:20.149
Try to keep everything
in this way.

19:20.183 --> 19:21.741
We have to ensure strong.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.980
The doors give advantage to the rebels,
we cannot reach them.

19:24.020 --> 19:27.148
- Then find them. - Lord,
we have to find others!

19:27.190 --> 19:30.682
After!
Before we get rebel!

19:31.828 --> 19:35.025
Jameson, Shaw,
to the south.

19:35.498 --> 19:38.490
The three of you with me.
Brown is in charge of these ports!

19:39.236 --> 19:40.794
Go!

20:00.223 --> 20:02.487
Let's see what we can
do with it.

21:03.286 --> 21:07.017
Nothing...
Where are the others?

21:08.191 --> 21:10.386
I think I saw the northwest.

21:10.994 --> 21:12.757
Okay, let's go.

21:16.299 --> 21:17.766
Caution.

21:17.767 --> 21:21.029
You there. Turn It Up!

21:22.739 --> 21:25.173
I said to surrender!

21:25.241 --> 21:28.039
We take you and cannot escape.
Put down your weapons.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.773
Surrender, or shoot back.

21:29.813 --> 21:32.338
Identify themselves.

21:33.183 --> 21:34.980
I am Thomas Jonathan Jackson.

21:35.018 --> 21:38.181
Army general
confederation.

21:38.221 --> 21:41.054
General Jackson?
Stonewall Jackson?

21:41.791 --> 21:43.691
Himself.

21:43.727 --> 21:45.490
It is an honour to meet you, sir.

21:45.528 --> 21:49.362
However good you are, General,
should now surrender

21:49.966 --> 21:51.991
or die where you are.

21:52.068 --> 21:54.332
Do not surrender these facilities
for you.

21:54.371 --> 21:56.635
And I'll die happy
defending them.

21:57.340 --> 21:58.932
So be it.

21:58.975 --> 22:02.240
- General Jackson?
- Hey! We guarantee...

22:09.119 --> 22:11.019
Mr. Chamberlin, enough!

22:15.492 --> 22:20.987
General... not want to see
more blood spilled today.

22:21.798 --> 22:24.266
We exceeded you in number,
sir.

22:24.934 --> 22:27.300
Please put the gun down.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.940
Abraham Lincoln.

22:38.615 --> 22:40.981
I wanted to meet him,

22:41.618 --> 22:44.644
but under circumstances
different.

22:59.235 --> 23:00.862
Empty.

23:02.205 --> 23:04.435
General, can I ask how
ended up in this place?

23:04.474 --> 23:08.035
You may ask, sir,
but the big question is

23:08.111 --> 23:11.638
how you will respond by
murders committed...

23:11.681 --> 23:13.376
- ... This day?
- Murders?

23:13.450 --> 23:17.910
Yes, personally saw to kill
two unarmed Confederate

23:17.954 --> 23:19.922
moments ago.

23:19.956 --> 23:23.619
They went looking for this strong
refuge and you cut them...

23:24.327 --> 23:27.490
Literally... I must say
this scythe hidden in his bag.

23:28.164 --> 23:32.863
General, you know these men
were no longer members of his army.

23:33.403 --> 23:36.099
I can tell
which no longer males.

23:36.139 --> 23:39.199
Lie! They were looking
medical treatment.

23:39.242 --> 23:42.302
One was an officer...
the rules of...

23:42.345 --> 23:46.714
- See the tone with the president.
- Take care of your tone in general.

23:47.884 --> 23:50.182
Calm down, Mr. Chamberlin.

23:50.620 --> 23:53.851
Now we're fighting an enemy
much larger than ourselves.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.950
Want to General
admit it or not.

23:56.993 --> 23:59.427
Why not kill
these idiots now?

24:00.163 --> 24:01.892
Mr. Brown,

24:01.931 --> 24:05.298
I destroy my enemies,
instead of being their friend?

24:05.835 --> 24:09.931
No sir, they destroy
when the forest.

24:10.673 --> 24:13.301
We must preserve
our ammunition.

24:13.343 --> 24:16.210
We must persuade the General
and his men.

24:17.547 --> 24:21.506
Perhaps the wisdom of enxerguem
our situation and customs.

24:21.551 --> 24:27.387
These men need
medical treatment. We have a...

24:27.724 --> 24:31.160
- You have one? - You are protected
in many locks.

24:35.031 --> 24:40.128
The first order is to ensure that
strong that most intruders from entering.

24:41.771 --> 24:46.731
General... you and your men
can help us in this effort.

24:47.243 --> 24:49.837
We will not cooperate with the
enemy in service, sir.

24:51.481 --> 24:53.813
So be it.

24:53.850 --> 24:56.842
Sr., guarantees prisoners.

26:10.593 --> 26:13.562
General...
not mix things.

26:13.596 --> 26:18.693
We are in a situation very
danger and we must treat it as such.

26:18.735 --> 26:21.636
- Should we leave this place.
- We cannot escape!

26:21.671 --> 26:23.366
- Why not?
- We are on a mission!

26:23.406 --> 26:26.500
To hell with the mission, say
let the rebels to their destination,

26:26.542 --> 26:28.442
and go to a safe place.

26:28.478 --> 26:32.574
- That is impossible. - Not
know how many sick men

26:32.615 --> 26:35.948
- Are out there.
- They act like zombies.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.885
- Like what?
- Zombies.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.388
A word I learned
with my mother.

26:41.257 --> 26:45.284
Zombies are corpses betrayed
back to life by magic.

26:45.328 --> 26:48.923
But... only used
as slaves.

26:48.965 --> 26:51.297
They were... so.

26:51.801 --> 26:55.794
I also prefer the slaves
normal... Thank you.

26:56.572 --> 26:58.096
We should ask for help.

26:58.141 --> 27:00.268
How do you propose we do that?

27:00.310 --> 27:02.471
There should be a telegraph
in some office here?

27:03.379 --> 27:05.973
- At the train station.
- Have been disabled.

27:06.015 --> 27:08.074
Mr. Pin is a good idea.

27:08.151 --> 27:12.520
Now, Agent Hopkins, go to
I coast and toward the city.

27:12.555 --> 27:15.388
The rest is here and keep
the strong protected.

27:16.159 --> 27:18.559
I would like to take care
best of prisoners.

27:18.594 --> 27:20.789
I wanted to join you,
Mr. President.

27:20.830 --> 27:25.563
Mr. Brown, I think it has great
opportunity to fight with zombies

27:26.402 --> 27:29.462
but for now I want
help our forces here.

27:30.206 --> 27:32.140
Mr. Hopkins!

27:32.175 --> 27:34.336
You will be caring
of prisoners.

27:34.377 --> 27:39.280
Now we have to do our
work with absolute silence.

27:39.315 --> 27:43.945
The sound lighter including
shots, awakens them.

27:43.986 --> 27:45.851
And that will bring danger and death.

28:33.202 --> 28:35.329
What are your plans
after the war?

28:35.405 --> 28:38.101
I will return to the stage
achieve.

28:38.141 --> 28:41.668
- Are you an actor?
- I did some things, yes.

28:43.312 --> 28:44.643
I come from a family
artists, actually.

28:45.581 --> 28:47.913
That sounds good.

28:47.950 --> 28:50.009
It seems an interesting job
for a man.

28:50.987 --> 28:52.887
You have no idea.

29:02.865 --> 29:04.833
Damn!

29:04.867 --> 29:07.859
- This does not look promising.
- Perhaps the device still works.

29:22.685 --> 29:24.915
Mike!

29:26.622 --> 29:28.749
Mike!

29:37.714 --> 29:39.280
By God, help me!

29:55.818 --> 29:58.013
He's dead!
The dead came from nowhere!

29:58.054 --> 30:01.387
- How many?
- Many more have been!

30:01.424 --> 30:04.154
- Mr. President!
- Come on!

30:24.480 --> 30:26.710
Is anyone there?

30:27.717 --> 30:30.185
Open the door, damn it!

30:56.112 --> 30:58.080
It's too bad?

30:58.114 --> 30:59.911
It's just my leg.

30:59.949 --> 31:01.917
He went straight into the muscle!

31:03.719 --> 31:05.744
Please
stop shooting!

31:05.788 --> 31:07.847
We do not want to hurt you!

31:07.890 --> 31:10.882
We just want to seek refuge!

31:10.927 --> 31:14.590
We hit
and we had to break your door!

31:18.734 --> 31:23.535
The city is completely
infested by these poor souls

31:23.573 --> 31:26.041
who are roaming the streets.

31:26.075 --> 31:29.533
It's good to find others who are
except the infection.

31:32.615 --> 31:35.083
They will not talk to us?

31:35.885 --> 31:38.547
Maybe we can join forces.

31:48.164 --> 31:50.894
- Please bow your guns
- Put down its first.

31:53.135 --> 31:55.569
You'll be right there
know what is good for you.

31:55.605 --> 31:57.869
We come in peace.

31:57.907 --> 31:59.898
- Abe?
- Yes

31:59.942 --> 32:01.967
I am Abraham...

32:03.279 --> 32:04.974
Mary...

32:05.014 --> 32:08.745
- Mary Owens, you could...
- Mother!

32:10.286 --> 32:13.187
After so many years
you come in my house

32:13.222 --> 32:15.019
expecting me to give you shelter?

32:15.057 --> 32:17.321
I did not know
you lived in Savannah.

32:17.727 --> 32:21.458
Wait... You two know each other?
You know the President?

32:21.497 --> 32:24.261
My men need
medical care.

32:24.333 --> 32:27.029
Result of your
excellent marksmanship.

32:27.069 --> 32:29.037
Bring them here.

32:29.071 --> 32:31.039
I'll meet them.

32:35.478 --> 32:39.107
Mother.. mother,
could explain to me?

32:39.815 --> 32:43.307
I was your age and was
visiting his aunt Betsy,

32:43.953 --> 32:46.922
and met a young
by which I fell in love.

32:49.025 --> 32:52.552
And everything was... very magical.

32:53.763 --> 32:56.231
When I returned home,

32:56.265 --> 32:59.234
I asked one of the letters
if I would see him.

32:59.268 --> 33:00.735
He would marry me.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.632
So it was so.

33:03.673 --> 33:08.167
Listen to the story... when you arrived,
he never again spoke of marriage.

33:08.210 --> 33:10.007
But you wrote a letter

33:10.046 --> 33:11.877
saying that you were free.

33:11.914 --> 33:14.246
Of course I would not be released,

33:14.283 --> 33:17.150
but gave me no other option.

33:18.020 --> 33:20.386
He was the man?

33:22.058 --> 33:24.390
But he is not...

33:24.427 --> 33:27.988
Oh no, dear,
you're too young for that.

33:28.030 --> 33:31.193
I never lied to you
on the action.

33:40.242 --> 33:42.335
This does not seem so bad.

33:42.378 --> 33:44.710
I'll clean it up soon.

33:45.347 --> 33:48.214
Abe... this is my daughter, Sophia.

33:49.752 --> 33:52.186
And this lovely creature is Annika.

33:53.222 --> 33:54.814
The two work for me here.

33:55.357 --> 33:57.382
Well, did it
before all this started.

33:58.327 --> 34:01.228
- And this young man is Teddy.
- Tidal R., Mr. President

34:01.263 --> 34:04.494
- From New York.
- It was separated from the family.

34:04.533 --> 34:08.367
In the panic to accept here.

34:08.404 --> 34:10.463
I'm John Wilkinson, lady.

34:10.505 --> 34:12.906
And he is Mr. Shaw.

34:12.942 --> 34:14.466
And this is Mr. Hopkins,

34:14.510 --> 34:16.876
lying on her beautiful
oak flooring.

34:18.614 --> 34:21.014
Nice to meet you, guys.

34:21.050 --> 34:23.177
Why did you?

34:23.219 --> 34:26.052
My car was stolen while
prepared to leave.

34:27.089 --> 34:29.319
I thought it would only take a day or two
until help arrived.

34:31.127 --> 34:33.493
You are the help?

34:33.529 --> 34:35.759
Not as much as you expect.

34:36.565 --> 34:38.965
The rest of my men is
at Fort Pulaski.

34:39.001 --> 34:42.164
We go there so
end with Mr. Hopkins.

34:42.204 --> 34:46.538
And how do propose that we move
the unfortunate things?

34:47.309 --> 34:50.039
Do you have any choice but
the front door?

34:50.913 --> 34:53.438
The back door
facing the alley.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.574
As still have
of ammunition?

34:56.518 --> 34:59.317
- Do not fall without a fight.
- Very well.

34:59.388 --> 35:03.415
Okay, Mr. Shaw, we will
distraction in the front door.

35:03.459 --> 35:07.088
Attract all the zombies,
the rest can escape behind.

35:07.129 --> 35:08.596
Yes, Mr. President.

35:08.631 --> 35:11.964
- Can you, Mr. Hopkins? - We
protect women and children.

35:12.868 --> 35:15.359
This slightly increases the pressure
the moment Mr Wilkinson.

35:15.404 --> 35:18.373
No one needs to protect me.
I can handle myself alone!

35:20.242 --> 35:21.800
I'm sure you can,
boy.

35:23.012 --> 35:25.276
Surely we have a weapon
the most to you.

35:25.981 --> 35:29.644
Here, while
advancing,

35:29.685 --> 35:32.085
walk slowly,

35:32.121 --> 35:34.419
and press this club.

35:36.425 --> 35:39.360
Want me to walk
beside her, Miss. Annika?

35:40.930 --> 35:45.367
Well, dear, after the
dressings on Mr. Hopkins can go.

35:45.401 --> 35:48.837
Go straight to the strong
we'll meet there.

35:49.572 --> 35:52.871
- Do not be afraid, lady.
- Rarely have I, Mr. Lincoln.

36:27.943 --> 36:29.638
There they are! Come on!

36:41.991 --> 36:44.016
Mr. Shaw!

36:47.997 --> 36:49.931
Come on!

36:54.370 --> 36:57.203
Open the Gate!

36:57.973 --> 36:59.941
They are coming!

37:10.242 --> 37:13.942
{Gunshot}

37:21.163 --> 37:22.630
Come on.

37:22.665 --> 37:25.156
- She cannot go, boy.
Bite her! - No!

37:26.135 --> 37:28.283
- Fast!
- Now!

37:48.724 --> 37:50.715
All in!

37:52.880 --> 37:56.931
How could you do that?
How could he leave her?

38:00.836 --> 38:03.270
There is no hope
for any of them?

38:03.305 --> 38:05.569
- None.
- Where is Mike?

38:07.676 --> 38:09.803
He didnâ€™t make it.

38:11.413 --> 38:14.712
- And you?
- Only one bullet, I swear.

38:15.250 --> 38:16.774
I do not bite.

38:16.819 --> 38:19.083
She shot me.

38:19.121 --> 38:20.952
A lady has the right
to protect themselves.

38:20.990 --> 38:25.154
- And the mission? - The Telegraph
was destroyed when we arrived.

38:30.132 --> 38:32.259
What is your plan, Abe?

38:34.636 --> 38:36.763
I wish I could have one.

38:36.805 --> 38:40.935
Cannot know
the total number

38:40.976 --> 38:43.171
zombie in this part.

38:44.113 --> 38:48.982
We have few men without much
supplies for lack of time.

38:54.523 --> 38:57.321
Mary...

38:57.793 --> 39:00.728
This epidemic
must be contained.

39:01.363 --> 39:03.490
There is nothing that one can use
this strong?

39:05.100 --> 39:07.568
Nothing we have found.

39:09.638 --> 39:12.232
I question your
trial.

39:13.709 --> 39:16.371
- I question... - Beware
says Mr. Wilkinson.

39:17.780 --> 39:22.877
He lied and had no idea
what we were facing.

39:23.452 --> 39:28.219
- We did not come prepared.
- We have our training.

39:28.824 --> 39:30.792
The certain death awaits us
each time we returned.

39:31.393 --> 39:37.195
And he still finds time to...
save two tramps.

39:38.901 --> 39:41.301
He has a good argument.

39:42.704 --> 39:44.763
Calm down, sir.

39:44.807 --> 39:47.139
- General, I wanted...
- Mr. Lincoln.

39:47.176 --> 39:49.872
I object to the presence
a...

39:50.612 --> 39:52.773
The woman... my forte.

39:53.549 --> 39:56.416
Mrs. Owens is an old friend
I, General Jackson.

39:56.452 --> 40:00.411
If I say something,
this is a strong war.

40:01.323 --> 40:05.987
I would say that we have more challenges
before us that require

40:06.028 --> 40:08.155
more attention than the presence
a woman, sir.

40:10.232 --> 40:14.532
Actually I came to talk to
you on that subject.

40:14.570 --> 40:16.561
Sit down, please.

40:20.075 --> 40:24.535
Our recent search changed
to have very different.

40:24.580 --> 40:27.378
In this situation
we are facing,

40:27.416 --> 40:30.112
we cannot be
in place indefinitely

40:30.686 --> 40:33.018
and just go out
nor is it a possibility.

40:33.789 --> 40:35.780
What we do

40:35.824 --> 40:39.555
is to kill all these zombies.

40:39.628 --> 40:42.893
Zombies? That seems gossip
slave, sir.

40:42.931 --> 40:46.458
These are unfortunate people
they were soldiers, and some

40:46.535 --> 40:48.469
are heroes of the confederacy.

40:48.504 --> 40:52.804
Some may be civilians, but
everyone has the right to live.

40:52.841 --> 40:57.369
Are already dead,
just do not know it.

40:57.412 --> 40:58.811
No, they...

41:00.849 --> 41:03.716
They ill.

41:05.020 --> 41:07.648
Come visit their prisoners.

41:08.657 --> 41:11.057
No cure there is no hope.

41:11.093 --> 41:14.324
For starters, there is no chance
have a peaceful death.

41:15.564 --> 41:18.863
Since the time of infection
you have 24 hours.

41:19.601 --> 41:23.469
After the conversion is complete
and you can spread the disease.

41:24.239 --> 41:26.833
His body
still working.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.740
They are pure speculation,
you do not even know...

41:28.777 --> 41:31.541
I do idea, General.

41:33.549 --> 41:36.040
I have faced anything like this before.

41:42.991 --> 41:45.323
It was a boy
9 years in Indiana.

41:45.360 --> 41:47.590
When thus a disease
invaded our town

41:48.330 --> 41:52.130
began to destroy
our community.

41:52.167 --> 41:55.364
For no apparent reason.

41:56.038 --> 41:58.199
And no explanation
that we could see.

41:58.840 --> 42:04.437
Myths and rumours, all from meat
infected by black magic.

42:04.913 --> 42:06.881
But no real answer.

42:07.716 --> 42:11.484
Good people... friends.

42:13.989 --> 42:16.150
Family members,
all fell.

42:17.292 --> 42:19.192
After much blood,

42:20.362 --> 42:23.024
eradicated other cities.

42:24.032 --> 42:26.626
At least found
we had done it.

42:27.469 --> 42:31.838
Until two days ago when a
infected man came back this strong.

42:36.445 --> 42:39.243
This disease is spread quickly and mercy.

42:41.817 --> 42:45.412
The only way to defeat it is
kill all the infected people.

42:45.454 --> 42:47.786
There is no other way.

42:48.690 --> 42:53.320
Sounds attract these creatures
when a shot in the head affects

42:53.362 --> 42:55.262
attracts more.

42:56.498 --> 42:58.864
A perfect aim can be
difficult to achieve

42:58.900 --> 43:00.925
in such circumstances.

43:00.969 --> 43:03.836
Being behind them
is much safer.

43:06.241 --> 43:07.970
General!

43:08.010 --> 43:11.468
It has a sword, knife or other
tools that could

43:11.513 --> 43:14.971
- Use in this war, sir?
- Mr. Lincoln.

43:15.017 --> 43:20.011
Had a mobile cannon here,
I certainly would not tell you.

43:20.055 --> 43:23.684
Since you
is my enemy, sir.

43:23.725 --> 43:27.923
And do I help him
in their inhuman acts.

43:28.530 --> 43:30.760
This is unfortunate, sir.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.465
Your help would be nice to me.

43:34.069 --> 43:36.970
Besides its people are
running much danger as mine.

43:38.607 --> 43:41.440
Mr. President,
I have a suggestion.

43:41.476 --> 43:44.843
In recent months I have come to
a town near here.

43:44.880 --> 43:48.179
There is a plantation a mile
here where many of the implements

43:48.216 --> 43:50.480
are of the type
that just described.

43:50.519 --> 43:53.215
We could get them
and use them as weapons.

43:54.222 --> 43:56.315
What is your name?

43:56.358 --> 43:57.916
Brad Kirk, sir.

43:59.995 --> 44:03.294
And you would work alongside
union men on such a mission?

44:03.332 --> 44:04.890
Would work.

44:05.634 --> 44:08.603
I think this crisis
is greater than we

44:09.838 --> 44:11.669
and after all
we are all Americans.

44:12.641 --> 44:14.905
Very well.

44:14.943 --> 44:17.138
Come with me.

44:18.847 --> 44:21.441
Out again?
This is a madness.

44:21.516 --> 44:23.609
What makes you think we can
trust the rebels, Mr. President?

44:24.619 --> 44:27.053
I believe he is
a man of his word.

44:27.989 --> 44:30.685
Do not put my life
in the hands of the rebels.

44:30.726 --> 44:32.887
Neither do I.

44:32.928 --> 44:35.692
- Neither do I.
- I do, sir.

44:36.431 --> 44:38.831
I do not think so
much later.

44:39.501 --> 44:41.799
I understand.

44:42.304 --> 44:44.864
But who will come with us
this mission?

44:47.242 --> 44:49.733
Sophia and I will join
to you, Abe.

44:49.778 --> 44:51.803
Me too.

44:51.847 --> 44:55.578
And many want to kill zombies
send them back to hell.

44:56.385 --> 45:00.082
His enthusiasm surprises me,
Mr. Rosendale.

45:00.122 --> 45:02.556
You are a young
very brave.

45:03.191 --> 45:08.026
Okay then...
there is no time to lose.

45:31.987 --> 45:34.922
We must avoid conflicts
at all costs.

45:35.957 --> 45:39.586
The return to the safety distance
is too long to take the risk.

45:42.330 --> 45:45.925
- If I may, ma'am.
- It's best to walk, Mr. Shaw.

45:46.535 --> 45:49.095
Yes.. but I was
wondering

45:49.971 --> 45:52.997
as you just this type
of circumstance?

45:53.642 --> 45:56.543
Hunting for zombies?
Or prostitution?

45:57.946 --> 46:02.883
- Referring to me... - It's just what has
for women like my mother and me.

46:03.685 --> 46:05.744
Especially here,

46:05.787 --> 46:09.052
war is no friend of women
unmarried with children, Mr. Shaw.

46:09.858 --> 46:11.917
It is not my intention
judge you, Sophia.

46:12.561 --> 46:14.791
Never is.

46:14.830 --> 46:18.698
If we survive all this, I
could take it somewhere.

46:28.276 --> 46:30.141
Tools
must be in the barn.

46:32.881 --> 46:35.645
Remember...
trample with care

46:35.684 --> 46:37.982
and be silent.

46:43.658 --> 46:45.990
Why are not they
attacking us?

46:46.027 --> 46:49.690
- They must be asleep.
- Say your prayers, friends.

48:15.951 --> 48:18.112
No! The noise!

48:59.861 --> 49:02.625
Mr. President!
I thought I needed help.

49:04.332 --> 49:05.959
Come on!

49:06.001 --> 49:07.992
Come on.

49:16.378 --> 49:18.539
Open the doors,
they're coming!

50:08.329 --> 50:10.297
How are you feeling?

50:11.966 --> 50:14.230
Too bad.

50:14.269 --> 50:16.965
I feel I'm falling.

50:17.005 --> 50:21.442
I feel I'm
losing consciousness.

50:23.712 --> 50:28.115
- Much pain?
- No worse than light.

50:32.020 --> 50:37.856
Mary... I have no words
to express my pain.

50:39.794 --> 50:43.161
Not only for their
current condition,

50:45.200 --> 50:48.431
for my actions
years ago.

50:50.605 --> 50:53.073
I loved you.

50:54.375 --> 50:56.605
Still love you.

50:57.212 --> 51:00.079
I never imported another woman
that was not you.

51:03.418 --> 51:06.216
I was so young and foolish.

51:06.855 --> 51:09.983
I took some advice
questionable.

51:11.659 --> 51:14.184
The truth is that I did not think
that you deserve.

51:15.663 --> 51:18.757
I am not asking you to forgive me,

51:18.800 --> 51:21.064
But I forgive you
the same way, Abraham.

51:23.605 --> 51:26.039
That's very sweet
on your part.

51:29.978 --> 51:33.106
I should tell Sophia
about your condition?

51:33.715 --> 51:35.876
No...

51:35.917 --> 51:39.353
I'll tell her.

51:39.888 --> 51:42.152
Alright.

51:42.190 --> 51:46.559
I'll call her and...
then I come visit you.

51:49.998 --> 51:51.397
Be brave, Abe.

51:54.602 --> 51:56.866
You know what to do.

51:59.140 --> 52:02.906
I look forward to this match

52:03.478 --> 52:06.208
until we succeed.

52:06.247 --> 52:10.081
And conquer... the undead.

52:55.830 --> 52:58.060
It will not help us?

52:58.099 --> 53:03.901
No, and you, soldier,
will be marked by insubordination.

53:04.572 --> 53:06.699
Roger that, sir.

53:12.614 --> 53:16.414
This morning,
without charity from anyone

53:17.452 --> 53:20.649
march to war.

53:21.389 --> 53:24.586
With our dear Lord,

53:25.159 --> 53:27.992
and this map
designed by Garrett,

53:28.029 --> 53:33.160
we have to kill as many creatures
as our strength allows us to.

53:36.771 --> 53:39.365
Everyone knows the strategy.

53:39.407 --> 53:41.272
Know their peers.

53:41.309 --> 53:44.608
They go to their assigned positions,
Clear the area

53:44.646 --> 53:48.844
and advance to next position
until the city is clean.

53:49.651 --> 53:53.382
- And back here safe.
- It seems very simple.

53:54.489 --> 53:58.892
Cannot fail,
if they are determined.

53:58.960 --> 54:00.951
Otherwise will not succeed!

54:00.995 --> 54:03.429
But I must remind you,
again

54:03.464 --> 54:06.297
if any member of our
team is infected,

54:07.101 --> 54:10.264
should be treated as a
enemy and must be eliminated.

54:11.739 --> 54:14.469
There can be exceptions
to this rule.

54:14.509 --> 54:16.534
President Lincoln,

54:17.011 --> 54:19.707
I cannot support this mission.

54:19.747 --> 54:23.478
Blooded murder of innocent people
cold is simply unacceptable.

54:24.252 --> 54:26.117
I understand.

54:26.888 --> 54:30.346
Anybody else have something to say...

54:30.391 --> 54:32.256
on the ethics of our task?

54:35.530 --> 54:37.691
Very well.

54:37.732 --> 54:42.635
Mr. Wilkinson, watch Mary Owens
while she feels weak through.

54:42.670 --> 54:45.366
Reassure her if necessary.

54:46.140 --> 54:49.405
- Yes, sir. - Tell Mr. Hopkins
to continue with the prisoners.

54:50.111 --> 54:53.444
Now, the decision
Mr. Wilkinson, Mr. Pin,

54:53.481 --> 54:56.814
you accompany Mr. Garrett,
and Mr. Rosendale, you stay here.

54:56.851 --> 54:59.046
Do not do that, Mr. President.

55:00.054 --> 55:02.022
Very well then.

55:02.056 --> 55:04.456
You will join Miss. Owens.

55:05.159 --> 55:07.184
Give us a moment

55:08.096 --> 55:10.087
Spike to remind the agent,

55:10.932 --> 55:12.797
Barn and Don Kelly.

55:14.502 --> 55:18.836
These valiant men who
fought and died here,

55:19.540 --> 55:21.872
who came to defend
this land,

55:22.510 --> 55:26.606
and we, the living,

55:26.647 --> 55:31.778
let's finish the job
of noble men.

55:32.553 --> 55:35.283
They did not die in vain.

57:40.414 --> 57:41.847
Remember, Eddie,

57:41.883 --> 57:45.341
men who are against it
they cannot against anything.

57:45.386 --> 57:46.785
Yes, Mr. President!

57:57.765 --> 58:00.131
A man should always fight!

59:04.832 --> 59:06.663
I suppose that is all.

59:07.468 --> 59:09.936
We cannot say,

59:09.971 --> 59:11.666
but we have gone well
until now.

59:11.706 --> 59:14.266
We should go back to the strong
and rest awhile.

59:15.009 --> 59:16.840
I'm not tired.

59:18.746 --> 59:22.273
Again back!

59:26.120 --> 59:27.781
The tramp of Lincoln,

59:27.822 --> 59:30.382
the great lost love

59:30.424 --> 59:32.654
President
the United States.

59:32.693 --> 59:36.288
You are nothing more
than a prostitute.

59:39.667 --> 59:43.569
What society of Washington
will think, dear?

59:45.706 --> 59:48.300
It is too much for you to achieve.

59:54.215 --> 59:56.775
Only the brightness
youth

59:57.585 --> 01:00:01.146
affects the cheeks,
Ms Owens.

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.060
Do not go anywhere.

01:00:21.042 --> 01:00:22.942
What a disgrace, official

01:00:23.744 --> 01:00:26.338
the lack of respect
one who cared for you

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:29.042
for a crime
that this training

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:31.574
is unable to
compared to its presence.

01:00:31.619 --> 01:00:33.678
It makes me sick.

01:00:37.091 --> 01:00:39.059
Hans let?

01:00:39.093 --> 01:00:42.187
Yoram Hans let Centerville.

01:00:42.263 --> 01:00:44.163
Cannot be.

01:00:47.635 --> 01:00:49.967
After all these years

01:00:50.004 --> 01:00:52.097
here you are.

01:00:54.642 --> 01:00:58.408
That idiot you chained

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:00.505
as I passed by here
without knowing it was you.

01:01:00.548 --> 01:01:04.678
While the other men fled
a cold chase,

01:01:06.053 --> 01:01:07.850
makes my stomach sick.

01:01:08.723 --> 01:01:12.557
Want to know the secret?
I'm not who I seem to be.

01:01:12.593 --> 01:01:16.461
My friend,
I am a secret agent.

01:01:16.497 --> 01:01:19.864
No... I am not an agent

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:24.496
Lincoln's Secret Service, but
an agent of the glorious confederacy.

01:01:24.538 --> 01:01:27.029
Using the skills that
developed over a lifetime.

01:01:27.074 --> 01:01:32.239
In the theatre at all wrong,
even the President.

01:01:33.581 --> 01:01:38.177
A toast for me
and my ability.

01:01:40.654 --> 01:01:44.055
Thank you, George,
you're very kind.

01:01:45.226 --> 01:01:47.217
Health for their help.

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:55.799
I think you understand me.
I think it is mistaking

01:01:55.836 --> 01:02:00.432
Hensley on...
You do not hurt me.

01:02:00.474 --> 01:02:04.274
Is not it?
My companion and friend...

01:02:06.914 --> 01:02:09.075
Why not return
for battle?

01:02:09.116 --> 01:02:10.947
His boots are on earth.

01:02:10.985 --> 01:02:13.419
A bit of land
under their fingernails.

01:02:14.221 --> 01:02:17.622
I meant...
metaphorically speaking,

01:02:21.729 --> 01:02:23.458
This key opens
the lock.

01:02:25.232 --> 01:02:27.166
You are free!

01:02:27.835 --> 01:02:31.202
You are free to return
the battlefield, George!

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:36.137
No! No!
No, George!

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:38.803
No!

01:02:51.025 --> 01:02:53.357
You need to stay
with me here.

01:02:58.866 --> 01:03:00.493
Okay,
let's stay here.

01:03:01.101 --> 01:03:03.228
Do not take orders from you, Rebel.

01:03:04.038 --> 01:03:05.801
I was not giving orders,
I was just saying...

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.570
I do not care what you
can say, stupid.

01:03:16.617 --> 01:03:18.881
- We got to get out of here!
- Calm.

01:03:18.919 --> 01:03:21.444
Perhaps we can find
something to use there.

01:03:21.489 --> 01:03:23.753
- I doubt it.
- Worth a try!

01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:26.419
At least we can be
hidden until they're gone.

01:03:27.261 --> 01:03:29.559
Not going anywhere
until they say.

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:33.328
For the last time, traitor,
do not take orders from rebel!

01:03:33.901 --> 01:03:35.835
You want to stay here
and die?

01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:37.997
The prerogative is yours.

01:03:57.825 --> 01:03:59.793
Go, go!

01:04:06.367 --> 01:04:08.494
Okay... Teddy.

01:04:08.536 --> 01:04:10.834
I want you to hide here
until the battle ends.

01:04:10.871 --> 01:04:12.600
No, sir,
I want to fight!

01:04:15.142 --> 01:04:16.769
All right, kid.

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:18.937
Try this.

01:04:24.251 --> 01:04:27.152
- How are the ammunition?
- Are over.

01:04:27.187 --> 01:04:28.814
And if we get there until
we can find something?

01:04:28.856 --> 01:04:31.450
No! I do not like.

01:04:31.859 --> 01:04:33.622
We can buy one more day
to say.

01:04:33.694 --> 01:04:35.992
- Please?
- Come on!

01:05:14.668 --> 01:05:16.863
Maybe they're upstairs.

01:05:45.899 --> 01:05:48.265
I need to see what is
happening out there.

01:05:49.476 --> 01:05:50.660
Let's go up.

01:05:55.242 --> 01:05:57.335
No!
Stay here with me!

01:05:58.979 --> 01:06:00.844
What you see up there?

01:06:00.881 --> 01:06:02.906
It's all very dark.

01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:04.975
Why do not you...

01:06:11.525 --> 01:06:14.153
- Give me the gun!
- He bit you?

01:06:14.194 --> 01:06:17.857
What? It is nothing!
The gun! There's more coming!

01:06:18.732 --> 01:06:20.859
What's your problem?

01:06:29.243 --> 01:06:31.040
Who's next?

01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:39.335
Damn! See where
you point out, Teddy!

01:07:39.379 --> 01:07:43.907
His decision to succeed is more
important than anything.

01:07:44.618 --> 01:07:48.076
I can give the white
Mr. President.

01:07:49.389 --> 01:07:51.653
To the left,
Mr. President!

01:07:54.363 --> 01:07:56.792
To the right!

01:07:58.897 --> 01:08:01.329
Left!

01:08:02.669 --> 01:08:04.534
To the right!

01:08:06.907 --> 01:08:09.137
Everything looks clean,
we should go.

01:09:33.861 --> 01:09:36.261
Lord, thank you
for their help today.

01:09:38.265 --> 01:09:41.529
The men were very brave
who gave their lives in battle,

01:09:41.568 --> 01:09:43.798
the welfare of their nation.

01:09:44.638 --> 01:09:47.663
My God, I hope there is room
them with you in heaven.

01:09:49.209 --> 01:09:52.837
Dear Father,
Please heal Mary.

01:09:53.613 --> 01:09:55.912
She is suffering greatly.

01:09:57.851 --> 01:10:00.615
Lord, if only
can you hear me,

01:10:01.088 --> 01:10:04.387
give me wisdom to see
clearly the way.

01:10:07.194 --> 01:10:12.257
Let me help these undead
find their way to the end.

01:10:14.034 --> 01:10:17.731
Help me finish
his torture and misery.

01:10:18.372 --> 01:10:21.933
Show them the way
your eternal forgiveness.

01:10:23.977 --> 01:10:25.877
Amen

01:10:34.087 --> 01:10:36.112
If I kill you
while praying,

01:10:36.156 --> 01:10:41.150
your soul goes to heaven, but I
your soul to be damned and black

01:10:41.194 --> 01:10:43.219
as hell!

01:10:44.598 --> 01:10:46.828
So what will it be?

01:10:50.337 --> 01:10:52.134
I'll kill him.

01:10:53.006 --> 01:10:54.997
Mr. Garrett.

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:58.136
- Had a moment?
- Yes, sir!

01:11:00.447 --> 01:11:03.974
As ended up fighting on the side
the story wrong?

01:11:05.585 --> 01:11:07.917
I was born in Alabama,

01:11:07.955 --> 01:11:10.219
a plantation in Huntsville,

01:11:10.257 --> 01:11:12.657
in Louisiana.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.854
I am not an expert, but what
there was not something normal.

01:11:18.632 --> 01:11:20.429
When all men
of my family died,

01:11:20.934 --> 01:11:24.495
I thought about joining the war
and do the right thing.

01:11:25.205 --> 01:11:26.968
I was young.

01:11:27.641 --> 01:11:32.704
- And now?
- Well.. this scourge of zombies,

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:36.747
Mr. Brown calls the curse
upon us all,

01:11:37.451 --> 01:11:39.043
is wrong and here.

01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:41.213
Everyone should be dead.

01:11:41.254 --> 01:11:43.449
And if we find a
way to stop all this,

01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:48.291
not only destroy this country, but
end life as we know it.

01:11:49.329 --> 01:11:51.820
You are very wise
for his age, Mr. Garrett.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.027
I wonder what their
plans to end this conflict?

01:11:57.671 --> 01:12:02.131
Done here, go west
and be a cowboy, sir.

01:12:02.175 --> 01:12:05.576
You could have a career
impressive in politics,

01:12:06.446 --> 01:12:09.006
or the criminal justice too.

01:12:09.583 --> 01:12:11.244
Maybe you, but...

01:12:12.119 --> 01:12:14.212
I prefer to start
and a family ride.

01:12:15.589 --> 01:12:17.853
A life more attractive.

01:12:24.031 --> 01:12:26.932
I understand that everything went well.

01:12:27.868 --> 01:12:29.927
Not enough.

01:12:32.005 --> 01:12:34.371
I mean in spirit, Mary.

01:12:34.408 --> 01:12:38.435
I pray that God help us
and yet see nothing.

01:12:39.646 --> 01:12:42.137
You have talked
with General Jackson?

01:12:42.983 --> 01:12:45.213
Why do that?

01:12:45.919 --> 01:12:48.752
Is a man
of great ability,

01:12:48.789 --> 01:12:50.984
with wisdom and courage, Abe.

01:12:51.024 --> 01:12:52.855
Maybe he has some idea.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.723
Well, I'm not willing to in
see again.

01:12:57.330 --> 01:12:59.525
Maybe this will change

01:12:59.566 --> 01:13:01.864
while the situation becomes
more desperate.

01:13:03.303 --> 01:13:06.272
How we help our people
to wait here to die?

01:13:06.306 --> 01:13:09.139
Some things are worth
dying soldier.

01:13:09.176 --> 01:13:12.236
Yes, sir, many men of valour
show it around us.

01:13:12.279 --> 01:13:14.645
Are you referring to the Yankees?

01:13:14.681 --> 01:13:17.275
Yes, they try
do justice

01:13:17.317 --> 01:13:18.716
and I think in your heart
agree with me.

01:13:18.752 --> 01:13:21.846
- Soldier, someone has a duty...
- A duty which is not correct.

01:13:22.522 --> 01:13:24.854
At the end of day
are we not all brothers?

01:13:24.891 --> 01:13:26.882
And we must do what we know
which is correct?

01:13:26.927 --> 01:13:30.419
Someone also must follow orders,
cannot betray the trust of others.

01:13:30.464 --> 01:13:35.231
More than you even in this
situation, we made an oath

01:13:35.268 --> 01:13:37.634
to defend the confederation.

01:13:37.671 --> 01:13:41.573
General, all I know is that
this infection spreads.

01:13:41.608 --> 01:13:44.008
There will be a confederation
to defend.

01:13:51.618 --> 01:13:54.109
I have something to show
you, Mr. Lin...

01:13:54.688 --> 01:13:56.849
Mr. President.

01:14:05.803 --> 01:14:08.049
A... two... and three.

01:14:19.513 --> 01:14:22.914
I trust that this may
be of good use in their efforts?

01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:25.882
Certainly.

01:14:26.853 --> 01:14:28.946
You know what I
do with it?

01:14:28.989 --> 01:14:30.616
Yes?

01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:33.522
It is the only option available
that remains.

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:36.187
I do.

01:14:36.863 --> 01:14:38.990
I thank you, sir.

01:14:39.032 --> 01:14:42.263
And this strong
has other secrets,

01:14:42.302 --> 01:14:44.395
including a system of tunnels,

01:14:44.437 --> 01:14:46.769
which terminates in an output secret.

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:53.071
Did not teach you how to launch
a man in New York?

01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:59.275
Come on, Teddy, you can do it.

01:16:26.175 --> 01:16:27.573
It's time to go.

01:16:28.075 --> 01:16:29.319
Come on.

01:17:57.397 --> 01:17:58.921
Now!

01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:32.664
Now!

01:19:36.387 --> 01:19:38.052
I think it is time, sir.

01:19:38.401 --> 01:19:40.726
They are all inside the fort?

01:19:40.767 --> 01:19:42.826
Almost.

01:19:44.204 --> 01:19:45.933
Okay then!

01:20:04.991 --> 01:20:07.551
If you put the fuel
has an additional minute.

01:20:29.482 --> 01:20:32.144
- It's time to go, General!
- A few more minutes, Mr. Chairman.

01:20:32.185 --> 01:20:35.086
If you can, General,
it's time to move.

01:20:42.762 --> 01:20:45.629
- Something is wrong.
- There are still a few seconds.

01:20:47.033 --> 01:20:49.797
- We should go to a safe place.
- Take the General, Mr. Brown.

01:20:49.836 --> 01:20:51.997
Not without you, Mr. Chairman.

01:20:52.038 --> 01:20:53.801
Is there a problem
with the wick?

01:20:55.742 --> 01:21:00.270
- You and I will reacendo the wick.
- No, I do it.

01:21:00.313 --> 01:21:02.304
- General...
- Mr. President.

01:21:02.348 --> 01:21:04.441
Most of these men were
soldiers of the confederacy.

01:21:05.118 --> 01:21:08.019
They are all together and is more
appropriate for me to do it.

01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:31.787
Jackson?

01:23:33.966 --> 01:23:36.662
Great man,
great warrior

01:23:37.503 --> 01:23:39.869
until the end.

01:23:39.906 --> 01:23:41.965
Let the General die.

01:23:44.343 --> 01:23:46.106
How could you?

01:23:48.581 --> 01:23:50.845
Looks like you got it, Abe.

01:23:52.185 --> 01:23:54.517
I do not know.

01:23:54.887 --> 01:23:56.946
We shall soon see.

01:23:56.989 --> 01:23:59.082
And now...

01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:03.728
No! Mother!

01:24:05.098 --> 01:24:08.693
Yes, dear...
I think the time has come.

01:24:09.869 --> 01:24:13.100
No! There must be a cure!

01:24:13.873 --> 01:24:16.307
Doctors find it
every day.

01:24:16.342 --> 01:24:18.469
Tell her, Mr. Lincoln.

01:24:19.345 --> 01:24:21.711
- They can.
- But there is no time for me.

01:24:22.315 --> 01:24:24.613
Sophia!

01:24:26.919 --> 01:24:28.819
My dear,

01:24:29.422 --> 01:24:31.549
it's time to say goodbye.

01:24:32.658 --> 01:24:35.024
- Mary...
- Abe

01:24:35.795 --> 01:24:39.356
if you do not remember
what we said here,

01:24:40.266 --> 01:24:43.667
never forget what we did.

01:24:44.303 --> 01:24:49.366
And now... is for you... is just
the living end the job.

01:24:51.077 --> 01:24:53.011
Good luck, Mr. President.

01:24:54.347 --> 01:24:55.712
Thank you, Mr. Garrett.

01:25:18.271 --> 01:25:20.501
This fort was built
7 years

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:23.566
where our fathers brought
win a new nation,

01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:29.174
to see the freedom to be
dedicated to the proposition

01:25:29.215 --> 01:25:31.149
that all men
are equal.

01:25:33.019 --> 01:25:35.544
Now we are in a
great civil war,

01:25:36.956 --> 01:25:39.288
testing whether that nation

01:25:39.992 --> 01:25:43.860
or any other nation
conceived and so dedicated,

01:25:43.896 --> 01:25:45.557
can do the impossible.

01:25:46.399 --> 01:25:49.664
We're in this big field
battle of that war.

01:25:51.370 --> 01:25:54.635
We have come to dedicate a portion
this field

01:25:55.174 --> 01:25:57.734
as the final resting place

01:25:58.444 --> 01:26:02.312
for those who gave their
lives for the nation alive.

01:26:04.417 --> 01:26:07.818
This fits perfectly,

01:26:07.854 --> 01:26:10.186
in a proper way
just as we did this.

01:26:11.657 --> 01:26:15.923
The world will not remember
what we said here.

01:26:17.663 --> 01:26:20.632
But never forget what
they did here,

01:26:21.701 --> 01:26:23.862
for us the living.

01:26:23.903 --> 01:26:28.602
Will be dedicated to the great task
what remains

01:26:28.641 --> 01:26:30.836
before us.

01:26:32.545 --> 01:26:37.073
We are here today and these deaths
not be in vain!

01:26:38.985 --> 01:26:43.581
In this nation, in the eyes of God, we have
a new birth of freedom.

01:26:45.458 --> 01:26:50.191
And a government of the people
by the people,

01:26:50.796 --> 01:26:54.960
and for persons
not die here.

01:27:08.514 --> 01:27:10.812
How's our patient?

01:27:11.257 --> 01:27:13.809
Like... more or less.

01:27:14.287 --> 01:27:16.346
And your research?

01:27:17.290 --> 01:27:19.690
There was more moved forward
a year and a half ago.

01:27:20.192 --> 01:27:22.820
- Frankly, Mr. President,
I think... - No!

01:27:22.862 --> 01:27:24.762
No!

01:27:24.797 --> 01:27:26.788
Find a Cure!

01:27:26.832 --> 01:27:30.996
Not only for her sake, but for
Next time this disease

01:27:31.037 --> 01:27:33.130
fall on us, can not
see how violent is it?

01:27:33.773 --> 01:27:35.900
Maybe I'm not the man
for this work.

01:27:35.942 --> 01:27:38.103
You know more about this
distress than anyone.

01:27:38.844 --> 01:27:40.744
But I know nothing.

01:27:55.561 --> 01:27:57.791
Mary?

01:27:58.431 --> 01:28:00.831
Good to see you.

01:28:01.901 --> 01:28:04.893
Sorry for having spent so much
while since my last visit.

01:28:05.504 --> 01:28:10.305
The feeling of hostility has
problems caused by the war.

01:28:13.713 --> 01:28:16.045
How are they treating you?

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:19.882
These people that I pay
to help you...

01:28:24.353 --> 01:28:26.888
Let's see.

01:28:29.695 --> 01:28:32.687
Doctor, this level of
dumping down is unacceptable!

01:28:36.936 --> 01:28:39.029
Nobody wants to be near her,
Mr. President.

01:28:40.239 --> 01:28:41.672
You can blame them?

01:28:47.881 --> 01:28:50.708
The victory brings
its own challenges.

01:28:52.218 --> 01:28:55.187
Some wish to punish

01:28:55.221 --> 01:28:57.212
as I look
restoration of the union.

01:28:58.026 --> 01:29:03.661
Do not understand that this is what
will heal the wounds of the nation.

01:29:04.992 --> 01:29:07.966
I cannot blame them.

01:29:09.702 --> 01:29:12.398
This is an impediment
our efforts

01:29:12.438 --> 01:29:14.804
every corner.

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:18.241
Even the old France.

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.805
Remember Mr. Wilkinson?

01:29:21.847 --> 01:29:24.042
Of my days in Savannah?

01:29:26.852 --> 01:29:28.820
The true identity of his

01:29:28.854 --> 01:29:32.153
John Wells is a rebel
active and spy.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.890
Informants report
it has

01:29:36.929 --> 01:29:39.921
led a revolt
in the nearby town.

01:29:41.333 --> 01:29:43.301
Are you planning
my kidnapping.

01:29:44.837 --> 01:29:46.828
And my murder.

01:29:50.276 --> 01:29:52.244
I'm not afraid.

01:29:52.945 --> 01:29:55.914
They are watching him closely and
I am well protected all the time.

01:29:56.649 --> 01:29:58.844
Thank you, Mary.

01:29:58.884 --> 01:30:01.011
Mary?

01:30:01.053 --> 01:30:04.784
Mary!

01:30:08.848 --> 01:30:10.281
Oh, my love!

01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:13.155
Forgive me!

01:30:13.199 --> 01:30:16.032
No! Let me clear this up
for you.

01:30:16.068 --> 01:30:19.094
- It disinfectants?
- Yes

01:30:20.172 --> 01:30:22.697
