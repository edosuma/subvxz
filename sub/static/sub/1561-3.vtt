01:32.009 --> 01:33.886
Oh, my God, it's real.

01:38.557 --> 01:40.525
Bernie, thanks for seeing me.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.319
No worries, darling.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.271
Can I get you something?

01:44.479 --> 01:45.901
Shot of tequila, perhaps?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.234
I'm good. Are we alone?

01:48.442 --> 01:49.694
Yeah.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.993
Wait! You should put on gloves.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.449
'The acetate's old.'

01:55.657 --> 01:57.500
The oil from your fingers
could damage it.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.039
It's freezing.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.874
You been keeping it
in the icebox or somethin'?

02:04.082 --> 02:06.551
Just run
the spectrum analysis, Bernie

02:06.752 --> 02:09.005
I need to know if it's genuine,
whatever you do don't actually...

02:09.211 --> 02:10.964
Listen to the damn thing.
You've made that clear.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.846
[cell phone ringing]

02:18.597 --> 02:20.440
Promise me, Bernie.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.481
Hear no evil, I swear.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.938
I'll get you when I'm done.
Now sod off, love.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.667
I will be home
as soon as I can, honey.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.619
- 'I love you, Mommy.'
- Oh.

[screaming]

03:31.336 --> 03:33.714

Don't make me do it!

(Chas) 'Hold it right there.'

04:18.966 --> 04:20.093
You Zed?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.351
John said you might show up.

04:21.553 --> 04:22.850
Kinda hoped you wouldn't.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.271
I gather that,
seeing how he didn't actually

04:24.473 --> 04:25.690
give me an address.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.393
How did you find us?

04:28.935 --> 04:30.903
Not a lot of millhouses
in Atlanta.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.232
John did say
you were persistent.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.908
Yeah, well..

04:35.108 --> 04:37.031
Found a place to live downtown.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.202
You'd better get used to me.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.576
Zed. That means zero, right?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.875
What kind of parents would
name their kid that?

04:43.074 --> 04:45.452
Who says my parents named me?

04:45.660 --> 04:47.628
Go on, then, let's..

04:47.829 --> 04:49.502
Say hi to his Satanic Majesty.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.549
Hear me..

04:52.876 --> 04:55.846
Most Unnamable of Devourers!

Shmaynee la geree la

05:01.718 --> 05:05.222
who natair yat aboola dahba.

05:05.430 --> 05:09.276
I seek an audience
with one in your embrace!

05:09.476 --> 05:11.194
- 'What's he doing?'
- He's learning a spell.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.692
Come on.
I'll give you the penny tour.

05:13.897 --> 05:17.197
Evray metah b'pee mehabbaqaq.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.073
The mill belonged
to an old friend.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.905
He called it
a supernatural safe house.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.036
Most of the stuff
here's too dangerous

05:24.241 --> 05:26.084
to fall into the wrong hands.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.042
It didn't seem this big
on the outside.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.007
It's not.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.255
I've been measuring the rooms.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.336
Sometimes it's off a few inches.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.889
Sometimes more.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.262
That doesn't make any sense.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.719
If you're looking for sense..

05:43.927 --> 05:45.725
You stumbled down
the wrong rabbit hole.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.903
Easy, mate.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.980
Even I'm not ready
for that one yet.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.655
I think what Chas meant was, um

05:59.860 --> 06:02.033
don't go wandering around here
without a chaperone, alright?

06:05.365 --> 06:06.708
Right.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.707
Each one of these stigmata
represents a place

06:09.911 --> 06:11.584
where something bad
is going down.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.462
Supernatural brushfires,
if you will.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.715
'Me, Chas and a few others?
We're the bucket brigade.'

06:17.919 --> 06:20.092
- ls this your latest fire?
- 'Bernie was a friend of mine.'

06:20.297 --> 06:22.345
No way in hell
he'd take his own life.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.927
Hm, doesn't mean his death
was one of your stigmata.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.603
Bernie lived in the Windy City.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.180
And I don't believe
in coincidences.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.731
Go on then.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.308
See if you get a hit.

06:36.605 --> 06:39.108
[intense music]

06:47.324 --> 06:49.201
I smell jasmine.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.757
She's a regular psychic
smorgasbord, this one.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.130
Picks up impressions
from tactile stimuli.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.337
Which I'm guessing is kinda
buzzkill in the sack.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.896
- It's cold!
- Alright.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.439
Well, I'll let you know
if any of that pans out.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.732
No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.685
You're not ducking out
on me again.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.895
You promised me you'd teach me
about my abilities.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.980
Teaching you is one thing..

07:19.189 --> 07:21.066
Lettin' you ride shotgun
on a spiritual scavenger hunt

07:21.274 --> 07:22.400
that's another beast, love.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.361
You said you didn't believe
in coincidences.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.786
That's right.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.910
And I show up just
when you're planning to leave.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.537
This is my education.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.370
- The cab's still down.
- 'It is.'

07:33.578 --> 07:35.296
- You got a car?
- A truck.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.832
Knock yourself out then,
MacDuff.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.168
But, uh, I'm in charge
of the music, yeah?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.056
The girl's got skills.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.633
Yeah, and she's easy on the eye.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.218
But?

07:48.426 --> 07:50.804
She showed up last week
out of nowhere.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.480
She may be legit.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.354
Or she may have more

07:54.557 --> 07:56.525
unseemly motives.

07:56.726 --> 08:00.196
Either way, I'm best
keeping her close for now.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.240
See what you can
dig up on her, will ya?

08:06.945 --> 08:08.743
[sighs]

08:10.782 --> 08:12.455
- What's in the man purse?
- Bits and bobs.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.252
Holy water, police scanner

08:14.452 --> 08:15.920
cemetery dirt, duct tape.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.749
- What's this?
- Oh, oh! Don't touch.

08:18.957 --> 08:22.382
These are nails
from the coffin of St. Padua.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.633
Patron of lost souls. Watch.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.310
'The nails follow one another.'

08:32.386 --> 08:33.980
Tuck one of these
in a bloke's pocket

08:34.179 --> 08:36.477
you got yourself
a nifty tracking device.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.061
Now, if only I brought
something to get through

08:39.269 --> 08:40.736
'That bloody door.'

08:44.149 --> 08:45.992
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!

08:46.192 --> 08:49.321
- Sorry. Clumsy!
- It's alright.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.951
Like this?

08:57.120 --> 08:58.997
We've got minutes at most.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.214
Oh, dammit, Bernie.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.351
Look at the state of you.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.679
How did you two know each other?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.481
Well, back in Jurassic times,
I fronted a punk band

09:16.681 --> 09:18.649
called Mucous Membrane.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.523
Yeah, that's right,
I wasn't always

09:20.727 --> 09:22.775
an upstanding warlock.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.232
Bernie here produced
our first and only record.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.155
He tried his best, but..

09:28.359 --> 09:29.952
To tell you the truth,
we were just a bunch of wankers

09:30.153 --> 09:32.201
trying to get laid.
And here we are.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.579
Reunited for one final
comeback tour.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.627
Courtesy of this!

09:38.620 --> 09:40.463
Hand of Glory.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.882
You take the left hand
of a man that's been hanged

09:43.083 --> 09:45.177
pickle it in amniotic fluid
for seven years

09:45.376 --> 09:47.344
say the right incantation,
and the dead will rise

09:47.545 --> 09:49.593
for as long as the candles burn.

09:49.798 --> 09:50.765
Here.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.138
Empty this on the floor.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.186
Okay.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.696
Hear me, most
Unnameable of Devourers.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.153
He who guardeth
the Golden Gateway.

10:12.987 --> 10:16.036
I seek an audience
with one in your embrace.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.207
Come on, old sod.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.508
[intense music]

[screaming]

10:37.887 --> 10:39.981
[groaning]

10:46.855 --> 10:47.902
Hold this.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.733
Bernie, Bernie! It's John.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.364
- Who did this to you?
- The voice!

10:52.569 --> 10:55.539
(Bernie) 'My God! The voice.'

10:55.738 --> 10:57.740
Voice? Uh, I, I,
I don't understand, Bernie.

10:57.949 --> 11:01.078
- I don't understand.
- On the acetate. So cold.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.755
No, no. Bring the hand closer!

11:03.955 --> 11:06.083
Come on, Bernie, don't leave me,
give me something else

11:06.291 --> 11:09.010
give me something else,
Bernie, come on.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.053
Moonrise.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.638
Rest in peace, mate.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.734
- Are you okay?
- I'm just fine, love.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.190
Just forced one of my
old friends to relive

11:30.398 --> 11:32.526
the worst moment of his life,
but I'm just fine.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.532
You said that every spell
had its price.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.706
- 'What did this one cost?'
- My own mortality.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.749
A few days' worth.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.043
Kinda like a reverse mortgage.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.620
You do that a lot?

11:43.828 --> 11:45.705
I do what it takes.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.212
Right, we need to find
a library to follow up

11:48.416 --> 11:49.463
on some of Bernie's leads.

11:49.667 --> 11:53.046
A voice, an acetate, and, uh..

11:53.254 --> 11:55.473
Moonrise, whatever
the bloody hell that means.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.596
Well, my guess
is Moonrise Records.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.972
See Google right here?

11:59.177 --> 12:00.645
Well, Bernie was
in the music business

12:00.845 --> 12:03.223
and back in the 1930s,
there was a blues record label

12:03.431 --> 12:04.273
by the name of "Moonrise."

12:04.474 --> 12:06.067
You don't say.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.269
The owner, Marcus Mooney,
he's still alive.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.321
We could go pay him a visit.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.693
[exhales]

12:38.132 --> 12:40.430
- Mom?
- Uh!

12:40.635 --> 12:43.184
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.389
I, I was just..

12:44.597 --> 12:47.191
[scoffs] Why are you up?

12:47.392 --> 12:49.770
I had a nightmare.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.821
Aw, baby.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.441
Someone was trying
to take you away from me.

12:55.650 --> 12:58.324
I'm not going anywhere, Julilah.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.575
[creaking]

13:05.243 --> 13:07.496
- Mom?
- Yeah.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.547
What's that?

13:22.552 --> 13:23.678
(John) 'Hi.'

13:23.886 --> 13:25.433
'We're here to see
Marcus Mooney.'

13:25.638 --> 13:27.481
Visiting hours are over.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.815
Health and Human Services.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.897
Now, I am sure, Tammy, that..

13:34.105 --> 13:36.654
You can make an exception now.

13:36.858 --> 13:40.078
- Room 2022.
- Thank you, now.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.326
- That was a neat trick.
- It's not a trick.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.580
Magic.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.203
And not the Copperfield kind.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.035
The card's charmed.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.836
It's got a pretty
bloody backstory

13:49.037 --> 13:51.415
but the gist of it is,
it takes on the appearance

13:51.622 --> 13:53.465
of whatever its holder requires.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.303
Who are you?

14:07.555 --> 14:09.432
Friends, if you'll have us.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.687
You seem like a friend.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.863
That one's got..

14:16.064 --> 14:18.408
A shadow dogging his soul.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.986
More than one, Marcus.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.118
I'm John Constantine.
I need some help.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.370
I'm here to ask about
the acetate.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.793
Lord, don't tell me
you played it.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.245
'No.'

14:30.453 --> 14:32.876
But a friend of mine,
he might have

14:33.081 --> 14:34.628
and now he's dead.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.758
You care to shed some light
on the matter?

14:38.961 --> 14:41.805
[sighs] You ever heard of..

14:42.006 --> 14:43.223
Willie Cole?

14:43.424 --> 14:45.802
A Memphis bluesman.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.978
Burned bright
in the '30s, and then just

14:48.179 --> 14:50.022
upped and vanished.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.897
I, ugh, used to produce him.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.942
(Marcus)
I had an old recording studio.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.365
I know you like to sing alone,
so I'll leave you to it.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.033
Alright.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.747
Willie 's legend was..

15:06.948 --> 15:09.497
He sold his soul to the Devil.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.870
Never put much stock in that.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.332
# Shadows gonna rise.. #

15:17.458 --> 15:19.301
Turns out..

15:19.502 --> 15:21.470
The acetate..

15:21.671 --> 15:24.140
He was working on..

15:24.340 --> 15:26.183
Recorded something when he died.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.512
# Bitch dogs gonna.. M #

15:29.720 --> 15:31.768
The voice of the Deceiver.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.520
Hm.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.397
That's an urban legend, mate.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.853
This is real.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.899
Hello?

15:47.864 --> 15:49.036
[low growling]

15:49.240 --> 15:51.538
No. It's not my path.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.874
You promised!

15:54.954 --> 15:56.501
You promised!

15:56.706 --> 15:58.549
[screaming]

16:05.798 --> 16:07.892
Wasn't nothing left
except blood.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.521
When I picked up the acetate

16:12.722 --> 16:13.848
I heard whispers.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.275
In, in, in, in my head.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.648
Voices

16:18.853 --> 16:21.151
telling me to do
horrible things.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.231
'And, and, uh'

16:22.440 --> 16:24.738
it was cold to the touch.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.365
It was so cold.

16:27.570 --> 16:28.696
Why didn't you destroy it?

16:28.905 --> 16:30.248
'Well, don't you think I tried?'

16:30.448 --> 16:32.826
U-uh, nothing worked.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.913
Sol buried it, l..

16:36.120 --> 16:38.543
Hid it,
I sealed it up inside a wall.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.297
And I prayed.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.549
Any idea how Bernie
came across it?

16:43.753 --> 16:44.925
'Private investigator.'

16:45.129 --> 16:47.848
Come to see me just last week.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.017
Knew about the legend.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.061
Wanted to buy the acetate.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.059
The private investigator,
he didn't happen

16:54.263 --> 16:56.561
to mention
who he worked for, did he?

16:56.766 --> 16:58.143
Oh, no.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.353
But I saw a name on the check.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.398
"Fell."

17:07.818 --> 17:10.037
You did very good, Marcus.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.205
I think it's time for me..

17:14.075 --> 17:15.952
To go to my reward.

17:17.118 --> 17:18.244
Why do you say that?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.798
I see an angel..

17:20.998 --> 17:23.217
Standing there.

17:23.416 --> 17:24.885
[gasping]

17:26.753 --> 17:28.631
Nurse!

17:38.641 --> 17:40.518
Shh!

17:53.364 --> 17:54.661
[sighs]

18:00.705 --> 18:04.255
You recognized that name
Marcus mentioned, didn't you?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.385
Fell.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.056
You remember I said that
Bernie found some real stars?

18:10.256 --> 18:13.977
Well, the brightest was
a metal head named Ian Fell.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.143
Sold his soul.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.687
You don't seem surprised
at the idea

18:16.887 --> 18:19.390
of Old Scratch
bartering for souls.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.148
There's one thing
I never understood is..

18:22.351 --> 18:24.604
Why he even wants our souls.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.315
The devil used to be an angel.

18:27.523 --> 18:30.276
That's why he's called
the “First of the Fallen.“

18:30.484 --> 18:32.077
You ask a holy type,
and they'll tell you

18:32.278 --> 18:36.249
the soul is the purest
expression of God's love.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.292
The spark of creation.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.713
(John) Every time the
First takes a soul

18:42.913 --> 18:44.790
he's exacting revenge.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.377
Paying back the Almighty
for casting him out.

18:53.924 --> 18:56.768
I do wanna hear you. I do.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.022
[instrumental music]

19:11.067 --> 19:12.819
- What are you doing?
- I'm breakin' into the mansion.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.324
Isn't that illegal?

19:14.487 --> 19:16.080
[grunts]

19:16.280 --> 19:18.282
Almost everything I do is, love.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.743
Come on.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.167
[grunts]

19:29.085 --> 19:30.678
[guitar music]

19:30.878 --> 19:33.222
(John)
There he is, that smug tosser.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.514
[speaking in foreign language]

19:44.183 --> 19:45.605
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Don't shout!

19:45.810 --> 19:46.652
Ancl don't squirm.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.570
How did Bernie get the acetate?

19:48.771 --> 19:49.897
Acet..

19:50.106 --> 19:52.905
Bernie was a friend, Ian.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.736
(John) He was a friend.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.367
And if he died as a result
of a deal that you made

19:57.571 --> 19:58.993
there's gonna be retribution.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.542
Look, man, I don't know
anything about any deal!

20:01.742 --> 20:04.666
A no-talent hack
turns overnight sensation

20:04.870 --> 20:07.339
and you're telling me
that you didn't take a shortcut.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.588
Hey, John, something's going on.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.044
I keep smelling jasmine.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.883
Now, this guy
is backing out of a deal

20:13.087 --> 20:15.089
and people are dying,
and you need to own up to it.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.846
He can't.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.644
He didn't make the deal.

20:20.845 --> 20:21.846
I did.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.056
(John) 'Jasmine Fell.'

20:24.265 --> 20:26.893
Off-key backup singer
and loyal spouse.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.398
'Ain't love grand?'

20:28.602 --> 20:31.697
Jasmine,
do we know these people?

20:31.897 --> 20:34.320
- 'We're not here to hurt you.'
- Oh, don't be so sure.

20:34.525 --> 20:36.448
The night's still young
and Bernie's still dead.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.744
This is a nightmare.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.075
Just tell me
what's going on, please.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.702
Yeah, tell him.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.579
Tell him how you entered
into a contract

20:42.783 --> 20:44.911
you're now trying to break at
the cost of other people's lives

20:45.119 --> 20:46.837
just so you could climb
the charts.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.163
That's not it.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.669
No, of course,
because the money really hurt

20:49.874 --> 20:51.217
your lifestyle, didn't it?

20:51.417 --> 20:53.090
The mega mansion,
the shiny clothes.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.422
Did you even bother to check
the price tag of those shoes?

20:55.629 --> 20:57.381
Ian was dying.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.433
He had cancer.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.181
I didn't see that one coming.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.151
You sacrificed your soul
for his life.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.357
Why don't you show him
the contract, love?

21:22.156 --> 21:23.749
[sighs]

21:26.076 --> 21:28.579
Do you remember your
first day in the hospital?

21:28.788 --> 21:32.338
They said you had a month,
maybe two.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.464
This man came to me
in the waiting room that night.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.049
He told me his name was Anton.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.221
Sounds like a soul broker.

21:38.422 --> 21:41.426
They troll hospitals
for the dying.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.854
I didn't even think
it was real, but I signed it.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.056
'Then you went
into total remission.'

21:47.264 --> 21:48.891
(John) I? I

21:50.184 --> 21:51.356
'Etruscan rune.'

21:51.560 --> 21:53.938
This Anton, he may
have been a skeevy bloke

21:54.146 --> 21:57.025
but he had a toe
in the nether realm, alright.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.701
Take a look.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.321
Anton said,
“When the last words faded

22:02.530 --> 22:04.203
“the First of the Fallen
would return

22:04.406 --> 22:06.204
to claim his prize.“

22:06.408 --> 22:09.457
So, why try
and break the deal, Jasmine?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.790
It wasn't my idea.
Anton got back in touch.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.500
He told me he could trade
my soul back for the acetate.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.261
Soul brokers never break a deal.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.635
They lose their right
of parley with the underworld.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.183
Something here doesn't add up.

22:22.383 --> 22:25.933
So what did this,
uh, Anton want you to do?

22:26.136 --> 22:28.514
He wanted me
to hunt down the acetate.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.269
'He knew you were
a rock star with money'

22:30.474 --> 22:32.192
and endless resources.

22:32.393 --> 22:33.315
(Zed) 'And motivation.'

22:33.519 --> 22:35.942
This, uh, Anton..

22:36.146 --> 22:39.070
When did he expect to lay
his hands on the acetate?

22:39.275 --> 22:41.573
I'm supposed to take it
to him tonight.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.950
He texted me an address.

22:44.154 --> 22:46.031
(John) 'Let me take
care of that for you.'

22:46.240 --> 22:48.493
I'm your best shot
at ending this nightmare.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.664
Give us a hug, then.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.051
Thank you.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.617
# Crows gonna fly #

23:29.783 --> 23:31.080
# Bitch dogs gonna howl N

23:31.285 --> 23:33.663
- What's that music?
- Oh, my God.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.248
Julilah!

23:36.832 --> 23:38.550
Julilah! Get away from it!

23:38.751 --> 23:40.344
Get away from it!

23:40.544 --> 23:42.217
- 'Oh, my God.'
- 'ls she okay?'

23:42.421 --> 23:44.298
- Look at me, Julilah.
- Ls she okay, Jas?

23:44.506 --> 23:47.134
Yeah, yeah, I think she's okay.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.016
[panting]

23:50.721 --> 23:52.314
(male #1)
'Open your heart to the Lord'

23:52.514 --> 23:55.142
'and let yourself be healed.'

23:55.351 --> 23:58.025
'For God's presence inside you'

23:58.228 --> 23:59.946
'in your mind, body and soul.'

24:00.147 --> 24:03.777
'God had, had spoken to us
through the scriptures.'

24:03.984 --> 24:07.329
'We must share the Gospel
and spread God's wisdom'

24:07.529 --> 24:11.625
'to those who have never
heard the word of the lord.'

24:11.825 --> 24:14.123
'Name it and claim it..'

24:14.328 --> 24:17.753
- Ah, you must be Anton.
- Who are you?

24:17.957 --> 24:19.925
Someone who knows
that soul brokers

24:20.125 --> 24:22.628
are ambulance chasers,
not original thinkers.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.964
Save a human soul?

24:25.172 --> 24:27.470
A wall licker like you
don't have the power.

24:27.675 --> 24:29.769
So..

24:29.969 --> 24:32.222
What kind of a con
are you runnin' on the lady?

24:32.429 --> 24:34.523
There's no con. Okay?

24:34.723 --> 24:37.351
Just give me the acetate.
I'll give her what she wants.

24:37.559 --> 24:40.153
She wants... her soul.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.486
And it's not yours to give.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.614
You traded it 20 years ago
for Ian Fell...

24:45.818 --> 24:47.912
- No, don't say his name!
- Why not?

24:48.112 --> 24:49.864
You just blew my deal!

24:50.072 --> 24:52.040
[laughing]

25:02.626 --> 25:03.798
(John) 'I should've
known that you were'

25:04.003 --> 25:06.552
'behind this, Papa Midnite.'

25:18.142 --> 25:19.815
[laughing]

25:21.228 --> 25:25.028
So Ian Fell.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.575
Thank you, Constantine.

25:26.775 --> 25:30.405
At least I know where
to find the acetate now.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.285
Papa Midnite.

25:33.949 --> 25:37.203
I didn't take you for a fan
of religious broadcasting.

25:37.411 --> 25:39.004
Unless there's
a Voodoo Channel I'm missing

25:39.204 --> 25:40.421
from my basic cable package.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.215
On the contrary..

25:42.416 --> 25:44.669
There's a lot these
learned men can teach me.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.551
(John) Like what, how to
trick a desperate woman

25:47.755 --> 25:50.679
into using all her resources
to obtain a deadly artifact

25:50.883 --> 25:53.762
for you, you know,
that recording, in your hands

25:53.969 --> 25:56.518
gives you more power
than I'm comfortable with, mate.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.520
Name it and claim it.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.772
Come again?

26:00.976 --> 26:04.526
It's the basic building block
of televangelism.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.950
There are promises
out there waitin' for us

26:08.150 --> 26:11.199
if we only have
the courage to name them

26:11.403 --> 26:12.950
and claim them.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.249
That's exactly the kind
of backward thinkin'

26:15.449 --> 26:17.042
I'd expect from a cheating

26:17.242 --> 26:19.085
drug dealing
Voodoo priest like..

26:19.286 --> 26:21.129
[grunts]

26:22.748 --> 26:24.000
[chuckles]

26:28.378 --> 26:30.221
[coughing]

26:32.216 --> 26:34.184
[screaming]

26:36.887 --> 26:38.059
[chuckles]

26:40.182 --> 26:43.186
They tell me
this place used to flourish.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.612
Busy factories, making things

26:45.813 --> 26:47.656
workers scurrying.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.733
Now..

26:49.942 --> 26:51.785
It's a concrete graveyard.

26:51.985 --> 26:54.079
All this just to get me alone?

26:54.279 --> 26:55.747
I'm flattered.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.245
You're gonna have
to respect my boundaries.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.577
I don't do zip ties
without a safe word.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.207
Made of copper.

27:01.411 --> 27:04.005
More than effective
against your mail-order magic.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.759
My men are unburdening Ian Fell

27:07.960 --> 27:09.883
of his problem as we speak.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.430
'Thanks to you, Constantine.'

27:11.630 --> 27:14.008
What do you want
with the acetate, Midnite?

27:14.216 --> 27:15.388
(John) There's no money in it.

27:15.592 --> 27:18.095
It's an insurance policy.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.101
A get out of hell free card.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.603
Don't tell me that's
not why you're after it.

27:22.808 --> 27:26.108
You know, I lied about Ian Fell.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.734
For you, lying is easy.

27:28.939 --> 27:31.158
You've been at it so long,
you've forgotten

27:31.358 --> 27:33.326
what it's like
to work hard for something.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.529
Ooh!

27:35.737 --> 27:37.080
Oh! What is that?

27:37.281 --> 27:38.624
Heparin.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.417
An anticoagulant.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.551
- 'You'll have four hours.'
- Aah!

27:53.755 --> 27:56.258
That's if you stay very still

27:56.466 --> 27:57.718
'and say your prayers.'

27:57.926 --> 27:59.473
A slow death.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.055
But not too slow. ls that it?

28:01.263 --> 28:03.436
'If my two associates
don't return from Fell's'

28:03.640 --> 28:06.940
with the acetate,
I want to be able to come back

28:07.144 --> 28:09.567
and question
you more... aggressively.

28:09.771 --> 28:11.193
[screams]

28:14.318 --> 28:16.116
I always took you for a..

28:16.320 --> 28:19.119
A Voodoo priest
with a flair for the dramatic.

28:19.323 --> 28:20.950
'But a cold-blooded killer?'

28:21.158 --> 28:22.910
I do what's needed.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.371
But I don't need
to darken my soul tonight.

28:25.579 --> 28:27.798
Not with the situation
firmly in hand.

28:27.998 --> 28:31.218
A pharmaceutical dose
of vitamin K.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.671
This will stop the bleeding

28:33.879 --> 28:35.927
if you can get to it.

28:36.131 --> 28:40.056
Consider it a show
of professional respect.

28:40.260 --> 28:43.605
If you live, you have
worked very hard indeed.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.435
If you die, it will be alone

28:47.643 --> 28:49.896
with your many, many sins.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.613
[coughing]

29:05.160 --> 29:06.537
[thunder rumbling]

29:06.745 --> 29:08.247
Great, yeah. Why not?

29:09.748 --> 29:10.840
[sighs]

29:12.042 --> 29:14.420
It's been hours and no word.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.926
Can you get
on that red-eye to Chicago?

29:17.130 --> 29:19.679
Yeah, man, I think
we're gonna need your help.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.226
Thanks, Chas.

29:22.844 --> 29:25.222
- How's Julilah?
- She's okay.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.774
- Finally asleep.
- Back up! Move!

29:27.975 --> 29:29.227
I'm gonna make this simple

29:29.434 --> 29:32.028
give us the acetate,
or everyone dies.

29:32.229 --> 29:34.823
- What acetate?
- Don't waste my time.

29:36.858 --> 29:40.078
You don't understand.
It's very dangerous.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.531
- No! No, no, no!
- Give it to us!

29:41.738 --> 29:42.580
- It's cool, it's..
- You can have it.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.623
Jasmine, if you give it up...

29:43.824 --> 29:45.076
(Jasmine) 'It's in there.'

29:52.416 --> 29:53.918
Just don't touch it
with your bare hands.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.470
Don't tell me
what to touch, bitch.

29:56.670 --> 29:58.968
Midnite said make it clean.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.015
We got what we need.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.022
Oh, my God! Your friend.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.069
Is smarter than they are.

30:16.690 --> 30:18.567
So are we.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.117
(male #2) 'Midnite should
be here any minute.'

30:23.322 --> 30:25.620
Weird. It's cold.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.833
Can't you hear it?

30:30.037 --> 30:31.289
The voices?

30:31.496 --> 30:32.998
Put it down, man.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.458
We need to hear it.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.463
They all need to hear it.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.842
'We're not supposed
to touch it, put it'

30:40.047 --> 30:41.765
put it down. Let go of me!

30:41.965 --> 30:43.808
Let go of me!

30:54.144 --> 30:55.396
# There was
a poor sod name of J #

30:55.604 --> 30:57.151
# For whom he had nothing
to pray #

30:57.356 --> 30:59.074
# He died all alone #

30:59.274 --> 31:01.197
# And he bled to the bone #

31:01.401 --> 31:03.654
H' And for what
he just couldn't say N

31:03.862 --> 31:05.034
# Go on mate #

31:05.197 --> 31:06.494
# Have a bloody nibble #

31:06.698 --> 31:07.950
# See what
the damned taste like #

31:08.158 --> 31:09.580
[rat squeaking]

31:09.785 --> 31:11.082
Oh, mate.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.253
Mate, you are..

31:12.454 --> 31:14.252
You are a welcome sight.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.049
Do us a favor,
cut us loose, will you?

31:16.249 --> 31:18.217
'Lives depend on it,
especially mine.'

31:21.546 --> 31:23.048
Hey, what are you doing
with that?

31:23.256 --> 31:25.475
Just cut us loose,
will you, mate?

31:25.675 --> 31:26.597
'Good.'

31:26.802 --> 31:28.304
No, no, no
that's, that's my shoe.

31:28.512 --> 31:29.638
Oh, bloody!

31:29.846 --> 31:30.722
[laughing]

31:30.931 --> 31:32.979
[thunder rumbling]

31:33.183 --> 31:35.606
What happened?

31:35.811 --> 31:37.984
What happened
to the John Constantine

31:38.188 --> 31:41.818
with the cojones to tell
an angel to go to hell?

31:42.025 --> 31:43.743
Cut me loose and I'll show you

31:43.944 --> 31:45.571
you celestial wank.

31:45.779 --> 31:47.201
We've been over that.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.034
- You know, I can't do it.
- I'm bleeding out here.

31:50.242 --> 31:54.213
You know, I feel your
moral compass wavering, John.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.337
You think that recording
might have trade value.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.134
Does it really surprise you that

31:59.334 --> 32:01.712
I want something a little bit
more potent in my arsenal?

32:01.920 --> 32:05.424
You're not dealing with
some second-rate hell spawn.

32:05.632 --> 32:07.930
If that voice belongs
to the First of the Fallen

32:08.135 --> 32:11.730
there is only one true way
to deal with that record.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.274
Do you have the courage?

32:14.474 --> 32:16.602
Maybe you'll find out..

32:16.810 --> 32:19.734
Once you free me
from these bloody ties!

32:20.981 --> 32:22.528
[groans]

32:22.732 --> 32:24.780
You don't need me for that.

32:24.985 --> 32:27.363
You got this situation
under control.

32:27.571 --> 32:28.823
[thunder rumbling]

32:30.532 --> 32:33.502
[groans]
Next time, I'm gonna punch him.

32:33.702 --> 32:35.454
Hey, mate, mate, listen

32:35.662 --> 32:36.959
I've got something for you.

32:37.164 --> 32:38.711
And it's all yours if you just

32:38.915 --> 32:41.418
if you just... cut me loose.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.503
It's in my front pocket.

32:43.712 --> 32:45.555
You won't be disappointed,
I promise.

32:48.508 --> 32:51.557
That's it. There you go.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.014
Now, you can use that
to buy all the junk

32:54.222 --> 32:56.771
and the deodorant or whatever
it is you wanna buy.

32:58.143 --> 32:59.941
Just cut me loose.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.027
That's it, mate, yeah.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.450
Just... cut me loose.

33:05.650 --> 33:09.621
If you're alive,
I can't use the card.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.619
Oh, no, no, you can,
uh, that's..

33:11.823 --> 33:12.699
No, no, no, you don't want..

33:12.908 --> 33:14.626
- Ah! Come on!
- God!

33:14.826 --> 33:17.454
- Get the hell out of here!
- Ugh!

33:17.662 --> 33:19.164
[sighs]

33:21.583 --> 33:24.177
- A hug? Really?
- Ugh!

33:24.377 --> 33:26.220
Yeah, I knew that was
out of character for you.

33:27.797 --> 33:30.471
You could have
just told me you planted..

33:30.675 --> 33:33.349
[sighs] ...the St.
Padua nail on Jasmine.

33:34.888 --> 33:37.641
- Ugh! You okay?
- Yeah.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.647
Just give me those pills
over there, will you?

33:39.851 --> 33:41.649
- Yeah.
- Ugh!

33:44.314 --> 33:46.191
[sighs]

33:48.193 --> 33:50.946
I knew you'd follow me
into the lion's den.

33:51.154 --> 33:53.407
I just needed you
to stay with Jasmine.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.458
- For all the good that did.
- Ugh!

33:57.327 --> 33:59.500
Midnite's men. Aah! Bloody hell.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.628
That recording
it's got a demonic energy.

34:02.832 --> 34:03.958
It wants to be played.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.669
Once it gets in their heads

34:05.877 --> 34:07.174
they won't be able to resist.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.596
- You bring my bag?
- Yeah.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.389
- It's in the back of the truck.
- Let's go.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.433
[indistinct chattering on radio]

34:27.732 --> 34:29.199
Bastards.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.996
They took it to a club,
gave it a spin.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.789
'They just couldn't resist
seeing what playing'

34:34.989 --> 34:37.118
'the acetate would do.'

34:37.324 --> 34:38.326
[sighs]

34:38.534 --> 34:41.004
[indistinct chattering on radio]

34:45.166 --> 34:46.588
Thanks for joining us.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.387
You bring what I asked for?

34:49.588 --> 34:53.013
Headphones,
MP3 player, clean shirt.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.092
- Orange juice.
- Really?

34:55.302 --> 34:56.895
It's gotta get
your blood sugar back up.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.938
Alright, daddy.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.643
I did what you asked,
I called in a few favors.

35:03.852 --> 35:06.480
A Pl friend of mine
ran Zed's prints.

35:06.688 --> 35:09.737
Whoever she is, she's not
in any law enforcement database.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.660
I don't know whether that's
a good thing or a bad one.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.284
[Zed whistles]

35:15.447 --> 35:17.074
Well, at least
she's making herself useful.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.284
[chuckles] For now.

35:21.578 --> 35:24.627
[sighs] Well, this is Freddy.

35:24.831 --> 35:27.209
He works as a busboy.
He said he saw the whole thing.

35:27.417 --> 35:29.044
I don't need
his whole bloody resume, love.

35:29.252 --> 35:31.471
Listen, how did you walk
away from this?

35:33.214 --> 35:35.342
Oh, I'm sorry, mate,
is it the, uh, is it the accent?

35:35.550 --> 35:37.894
No. It's your arrogance.

35:38.094 --> 35:39.471
He's deaf.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.727
[sighs] What happened?

35:43.183 --> 35:44.901
Says two guys went into the club

35:45.101 --> 35:46.068
into the DJ booth.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.987
Everybody went crazy.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.815
Like I said. Useful.

35:50.023 --> 35:52.401
The acetate has
its own hypnotic power.

35:52.609 --> 35:54.282
Those guys, they're
gonna wanna play that record

35:54.486 --> 35:56.238
to as big as audience
as they can find.

35:56.446 --> 36:00.076
'This isn't Midnite's doing.
His boys have gone off book.'

36:00.283 --> 36:02.786
[growling]

36:02.994 --> 36:06.464
- What's the matter?
- Don't you see it?

36:06.665 --> 36:08.212
[growling]

36:08.416 --> 36:09.713
See what, love?

36:09.918 --> 36:11.670
There's a tiger.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.596
White tiger.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.305
You see a tiger.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.682
- I see one too.
- 'Where?'

36:21.638 --> 36:23.265
Where?

36:26.518 --> 36:29.567
Scott University Tiger Radio.

36:29.771 --> 36:31.773
That's where they're going
to broadcast the acetate.

36:33.274 --> 36:34.275
Follow me.

36:34.484 --> 36:35.701
I think we should do
what she says.

36:35.902 --> 36:36.778
Alright, but we don't
have to just jump

36:36.986 --> 36:39.990
when she says it.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.667
Okay, that's long enough,
let's go.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.869
(man on radio)
'You're listening to WIXA'

36:45.078 --> 36:47.831
'Tiger Radio 97.5 FM.'

36:48.039 --> 36:50.417
We're almost there.

36:50.625 --> 36:51.842
'Who is that?'

36:52.043 --> 36:53.340
(man on radio)
'Everybody, get down!'

36:53.545 --> 36:54.842
Step on it.

37:01.803 --> 37:03.680
[tires screeching]

37:06.558 --> 37:09.152
We only got one set
of headphones.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.229
You two stay out here.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.566
Find a way to get
this station off the grid.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.616
[instrumental music]

37:20.447 --> 37:22.449

Give me some juice, Johnny.

[indistinct shouting]

37:51.853 --> 37:53.400
Screw this.

37:53.605 --> 37:54.982
Stand back.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.157
Stand back!

37:58.610 --> 38:01.033
[sinister growl]

38:14.751 --> 38:17.379

[sighs]

38:48.785 --> 38:50.458
[grunts]

38:52.831 --> 38:54.253
Nice shooting.

38:54.457 --> 38:58.212
Eh! Ace of Winchester.

38:58.419 --> 38:59.591
Never misses.

38:59.796 --> 39:01.514
Forged by a mystic
in the Old West.

39:01.714 --> 39:03.057
I'll bet you got
a whole war chest

39:03.258 --> 39:04.225
of toys like that, haven't ya?

39:04.425 --> 39:06.473
Yes. And soon one more.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.430
You know,
I can't let you take it.

39:08.638 --> 39:10.515
And you know you can't stop me.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.150
Stay right where you are.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.024
- You can't stop it.
- It needs to be played.

39:15.228 --> 39:17.071
[speaking in foreign language]

39:22.443 --> 39:24.286
(Midnite)
What is this? Constantine!

39:24.487 --> 39:26.410
[speaking in foreign language]

39:27.615 --> 39:28.537
What's happening?

39:28.741 --> 39:29.708
There's only one true way

39:29.909 --> 39:31.286
to deal with our recording.

39:31.494 --> 39:32.916
'I drew on the disc's
own dark magic'

39:33.121 --> 39:35.249
to send it back
to hell where it belongs.

39:35.456 --> 39:36.958
[screaming]

39:37.166 --> 39:39.760
It belongs to me. It's mine!

39:39.961 --> 39:41.804
It belongs to me!

39:48.469 --> 39:50.972
[dramatic music]

40:01.691 --> 40:02.988
Constantine.

40:10.992 --> 40:12.460
[knock on door]

40:14.746 --> 40:16.214
- What took so long?
- Sorry for the delay.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.382
Took a while
to track this one down.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.585
She's in there.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.925
(Ian) You need to help her.
She's almost out of time.

40:31.304 --> 40:34.683
- You sure this is gonna work?
- In a fashion.

40:34.891 --> 40:38.191
The Fallen One will lose
his claim on your wife's soul

40:38.394 --> 40:40.237
but what she traded it for..

40:41.356 --> 40:43.609
Your health.

40:43.816 --> 40:46.820
Ian, no.
I won't let you do this.

40:47.028 --> 40:48.450
What?

40:48.655 --> 40:53.252
Cancer? Yeah, sure, 20 years ago
I didn't have a shot.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.919
But they have
better treatments today.

40:55.119 --> 40:58.248
And now I got a lot more
to fight for.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.800
Alright, rat boy, you're up.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.595
You're the one
that brokered this deal.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.639
You're the only one
who can break it.

41:06.839 --> 41:10.139
- Time to eat the contract.
- I can't.

41:10.343 --> 41:13.313
If I break a deal
with the Dark One...

41:13.513 --> 41:17.234
Sod off! You've done enough
to hurt these people.

41:17.433 --> 41:23.987
[muffled shouting]

41:24.148 --> 41:25.650
Chew.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.819
[grunting]

41:28.027 --> 41:29.574
"When you said “Eat the contract"

41:29.779 --> 41:30.996
you weren't kidding.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.950
Where do you think
the saying comes from?

41:34.158 --> 41:38.584
It's as old as
the Aramaic on that rune.

41:38.788 --> 41:40.631
Swallow.

41:42.750 --> 41:46.675
[gulps]

41:46.879 --> 41:50.554
(John) We all negotiate deals
with forces bigger than us.

41:50.758 --> 41:53.261
But who are we truly
negotiating with?

41:53.469 --> 41:55.187
The divine?

41:55.388 --> 41:56.981
Well, it's only natural.

41:57.181 --> 42:01.231
Prayer is one big negotiation
with a higher power.

42:01.436 --> 42:04.189
But in times of true crisis

42:04.397 --> 42:08.027
we'll make a pact
with whatever forces it takes.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.453
And pay whatever price.

42:20.413 --> 42:22.757
