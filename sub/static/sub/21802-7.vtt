WEBVTT

00:11.120 --> 00:13.440
I'm pushing for organic food
in all of our cafeterias

00:13.520 --> 00:16.320
and I'll make sure our school complies
with Title IX

00:16.400 --> 00:19.920
so our girls' sports teams can get
equal support and coverage!

00:20.000 --> 00:20.960
Please, vote for me.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.280
She's pretty good.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.360
I have no idea what to say.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.480
She's all talk.
Don't psych yourself out.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.560
Listen, bro, just be yourself.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.400
Go out there and mingle
and get their votes.

00:33.000 --> 00:33.920
[Alex whispers] Hey.

00:37.600 --> 00:40.560
So, Tammy! Hi. I, um...

00:41.320 --> 00:43.960
I wanted to humbly ask for your vote.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.800
What have you got to offer?

00:48.120 --> 00:49.640
Um... [scoffs]

00:50.640 --> 00:51.800
Me.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.960
I mean, uh, you know, you and I
have been friends for a while now,

00:56.040 --> 00:57.120
and I really think that's what...

00:57.200 --> 01:01.280
Sophie's offering environmentally-safe
cleaning supplies for our locker rooms.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.600
What's your platform?

01:04.440 --> 01:05.840
My platform?

01:07.800 --> 01:09.960
My platform is to, um...

01:12.200 --> 01:16.240
You loved Daniel's platform, right?
Why change platforms?

01:16.320 --> 01:18.640
You know, I think, um...

01:23.080 --> 01:25.720
All right, look, change of plans.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.600
- Don't talk.
- What?

01:27.680 --> 01:29.240
Yeah, just look confident and smile.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.880
That's how politicians win votes
all the time.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.400
- With charm.
- With charm.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.000
[stutters] Yeah, I got charm.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.120
Attaboy. Just, you know, get out there.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.600
Is that what you're wearing?

01:40.480 --> 01:42.080
Wearing for what?

01:42.160 --> 01:43.640
- The debate.
- What debate?

01:43.720 --> 01:46.440
Have you ever seen an election
without a debate?

01:46.520 --> 01:47.880
Wait.

01:47.960 --> 01:51.240
Normally you'd be right. However,
this is an emergency special election.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.520
- Right.
- Exactly.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.040
There's no need for a debate, Brooke.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.880
If I were you,
I'd prepare my candidate on the issues,

01:56.960 --> 01:58.800
instead of wasting time arguing.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.560
[sighs]

02:04.680 --> 02:07.720
[Suzanne] A leader has to make decisions
all day long.

02:07.800 --> 02:12.000
The higher his or her position,
the more critical their decisions are.

02:12.080 --> 02:15.480
CEOs, judges,
military officials, senators.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.440
- Captains.
- [all chuckle]

02:18.440 --> 02:20.880
Today we'll be examining
what a leader should do

02:20.960 --> 02:23.880
when he or she has to make
life-or-death decisions.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.720
If you think that's complicated,
you're right.

02:27.320 --> 02:30.000
Over here, you can see
a car crossing the rails.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.480
Now here's the situation.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.440
This train has malfunctioned.
It cannot stop.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.760
It's gonna crash into the car
and kill everyone who sits in it.

02:38.840 --> 02:42.080
You can use the crane over here
to redirect the tracks elsewhere.

02:42.720 --> 02:46.320
But then, the train will crash
into this wall,

02:46.400 --> 02:49.280
- killing 20 passengers on board.
- [students murmuring]

02:50.000 --> 02:51.920
[Suzanne] So that's your decision.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.280
If you do nothing, five innocent people
trapped in the car will die.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.600
If you take action,

02:56.680 --> 02:59.360
you will cause the death
of 20 passengers on the train.

02:59.960 --> 03:01.360
What will you do?

03:06.560 --> 03:08.560
[theme music playing]

03:10.000 --> 03:16.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

03:28.000 --> 03:29.200
The most important thing is that you say

03:29.280 --> 03:31.440
- you're a doer and not a talker.
- Yes.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.240
Don't forget to ask Parker
what he's done up until now.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.800
Say you're as clean as a whistle.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.800
Tell them you're determined
and you always get what you want.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.160
Look, and if you ever get stuck,

03:39.240 --> 03:41.480
just remind everyone
that you're my best friend.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.840
- Mmm. Yeah. I can do that.
- Being so close to me taught you to lead.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.240
Anytime he mentions Daniel's name,

03:45.320 --> 03:47.960
tell him a captain should be judged
on his own merits.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.320
Okay, guys! We're ready.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.360
[Daniel and Brooke] You got this.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.680
- Breathe, breathe, breathe. You're ready.
- Thank you.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.160
Hey, Alex. Hey, listen.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.720
Even though you're Parker's advisor,
your vote is your own.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.360
- I know that.
- Okay, good.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.240
So I trust you'll vote
for the best candidate

04:03.320 --> 04:04.320
and not your best friend.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.640
Using the crane will be murder.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.360
I agree. There is no moral justification
for using the crane.

04:14.440 --> 04:18.040
Are you crazy?
You'd rather kill 20 people?

04:19.200 --> 04:22.240
Becca's right. It's like
what Spock said on Star Trek,

04:22.320 --> 04:24.400
"The needs of the many outweigh
the needs of the few."

04:24.480 --> 04:26.400
[Suzanne] Leo, what do you think?

04:26.480 --> 04:28.440
- I say flip a coin.
- [Hayley] Wow.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.600
- That's a mature decision.
- I think it's an unfair dilemma.

04:32.240 --> 04:35.720
Any choice would be problematic.
Any decision would be immoral.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.320
Well, that's exactly what makes
this dilemma so interesting.

04:38.400 --> 04:42.000
I mean, most of the time, a leader
has to choose between two evils.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.480
Yeah. Who gave you the right to choose
who will live or who will die?

04:45.560 --> 04:48.160
No, it's not about having a right.
We are forced into a moral decision.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.800
- It is, Max. It is.
- [Suzanne] Guys! Hold on a second.

04:50.880 --> 04:54.160
There's one more thing I need you
to take into consideration.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.600
Something I haven't told you yet.

04:59.320 --> 05:00.640
Hey! It's my dad!

05:00.720 --> 05:04.400
Let's say the people in the car
are your parents,

05:04.480 --> 05:06.440
on their way to the Greenhouse
to visit you.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.200
Now what do you do?

05:14.080 --> 05:15.360
What's this?

05:15.440 --> 05:16.920
Your credentials for the NASA launch.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.640
But I'm not going.
My father is.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.360
Then you should convince him
that you should go in his place.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.520
[chuckles] Have you met my dad?

05:23.600 --> 05:26.640
There's no way he'd let me steal
his moment in the sun.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.040
You were the one who told me
that you wanted to be

05:28.120 --> 05:30.400
a part of something big, right?

05:30.480 --> 05:33.000
You said wanted to serve your country.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.920
Well, this is your moment in the sun,
Jason. Convince him.

05:41.680 --> 05:45.000
If you get stuck,
I have the ultimate comeback.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.160
It's something no one
knows about Sophie.

05:48.160 --> 05:50.280
Remember, keep it classy.
No cheap shots.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.600
Okay, sure.

05:52.400 --> 05:56.040
- Really?
- Yes. Listen, bro...

05:56.120 --> 05:58.360
Break glass in case of emergency.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.480
- All right? Good luck.
- Thanks.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.240
Welcome to the official
captains' debate.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.920
[all cheering and applauding]

06:08.480 --> 06:10.320
The first question is,

06:10.400 --> 06:13.200
"Why are you qualified
to be our new captain?"

06:14.080 --> 06:15.520
[Sophie] As a female candidate,

06:15.600 --> 06:19.400
I have a fresh point of view
that the Greenhouse lacks.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.000
The world is changing
as more women are becoming leaders.

06:23.080 --> 06:26.560
And the Greenhouse needs
to keep up with the times!

06:26.640 --> 06:29.360
- [girls cheering]
- Yeah, Sophie!

06:34.080 --> 06:36.080
I'm not a talker. I'm a doer.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.120
[boys cheering]

06:43.000 --> 06:45.600
Okay, so, uh, tell us what you've done.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.600
Well, I've spent a great amount of time
next to Daniel,

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
and, um, I've learned
everything he knows.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.360
Okay, so that makes you what?
A great sidekick?

06:58.440 --> 06:59.800
[all booing]

06:59.880 --> 07:01.400
I can lead.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.800
I'm one of the top players
on our basketball team.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.480
[cheering]

07:05.560 --> 07:08.080
I'm fast. You know that.

07:08.160 --> 07:12.160
No offense, Parker,
but we need a leader.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.280
Not just a fast guy.

07:15.640 --> 07:18.480
I plan to make our campus
environmentally safe

07:18.560 --> 07:21.760
and to encourage more student activism.
What's your agenda?

07:21.840 --> 07:24.920
- [all cheering]
- [girl] Sophie!

07:25.000 --> 07:26.960
Now, hold on a minute!
Hold on a minute!

07:27.640 --> 07:32.920
How can any of you trust Sophie's promises
when she has a reputation of being a liar?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.560
Excuse me?

07:34.640 --> 07:39.720
I happen to have proof that
Sophie originally applied to be a Raven.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.240
Open your Louies, please. Observe.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.920
Now, maybe I don't speak
as fancy as Sophie does,

07:50.000 --> 07:51.880
but at least I'm honest. Right?

07:51.960 --> 07:53.680
- [cheering]
- That's right!

07:58.400 --> 08:01.440
You know what? It's true.

08:02.040 --> 08:05.080
When I first came to the Greenhouse,

08:05.160 --> 08:07.560
I thought the Eagles were
only into sports,

08:07.640 --> 08:09.120
and I didn't like that.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.440
But then I got to know the team better,

08:11.520 --> 08:15.160
and I realized
they're so much more than jocks.

08:15.240 --> 08:19.720
I mean, the Eagles are smart,
disciplined, go-getters.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.880
Who wouldn't want to be an Eagle, right?

08:23.240 --> 08:28.320
And ever since then, I've never...
I've never looked back.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.760
And that, Parker, that's
the honest truth.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.320
[all cheering]

08:37.120 --> 08:40.000
[chanting] Sophie! Sophie!
Sophie! Sophie!

08:44.320 --> 08:46.320
I'd save my family
without even thinking twice.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.840
- Do you all agree with Emma?
- [all] Yeah.

08:48.920 --> 08:53.080
So as leaders, you're saying
that you will base your decisions

08:53.160 --> 08:55.600
on how closely related
you are to the others?

08:55.680 --> 08:59.640
So you'd rather save your own brother
but sacrifice someone else's brother?

08:59.720 --> 09:01.480
Is that what you're saying?

09:01.560 --> 09:03.880
Let me make this even harder.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.800
Among the 20 people on the train
sits a young professor

09:08.880 --> 09:11.160
who's about to find the cure for cancer.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.880
Killing him would delay his research
for years.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.640
We can't know the scientist
will succeed in curing cancer.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.240
It's an intangible possibility.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.720
Even so, this man should not die.
End of story.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.080
- But my mother should?
- I don't know your mother, but...

09:25.160 --> 09:27.160
My mother is just a waitress,

09:27.240 --> 09:29.760
but she sacrificed everything
so I can get into the Greenhouse.

09:29.840 --> 09:31.480
Doesn't her hard work

09:31.560 --> 09:34.600
also make her a valuable member
of society worthy to be saved?

09:34.680 --> 09:38.040
Direct relation is objectively irrelevant
to determining the morally correct choice.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.480
Wait, there has to be a compromise
we can make here.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.920
There isn't a compromise.
You have to make a decision.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.640
Stop trying to avoid the situation.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.880
- I'm not avoiding anything.
- I thought you were a captain, right?

09:47.960 --> 09:50.680
You have to make a choice,
and someone will always get hurt.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.240
That's the way it is.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.800
So make your decision, Captain.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.760
Is she still talking about the train?

09:55.840 --> 09:57.280
If I was a leader
who had to make a choice,

09:57.360 --> 09:58.480
I wouldn't compromise.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.920
My father was an FBI agent.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.320
And I know that he would sacrifice
himself for the greater good.

10:03.400 --> 10:07.040
Because that was his job.
He would get everyone out of the car.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.880
There is always another choice.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.840
I should go see
how the Eagles' election is going.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.240
That was a great idea, Dad,

10:24.320 --> 10:27.040
to use Daniel's problem
and turn it into an advantage.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.160
That is how you teach democracy.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.760
One more thing.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.160
About the NASA satellite launch.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.520
I thought maybe
I could take the students there.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.400
Maybe another time.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.440
I think you should delegate
more authority to me, Dad.

10:50.520 --> 10:53.720
I'm the dean of the school.
I want more responsibilities.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.680
You're doing a fine job, Jason.

10:57.160 --> 11:00.800
How can I improve without experience?
I feel like I'm treading water here.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.320
Jason, I love you,

11:02.400 --> 11:05.400
and I look forward to the day when I
feel you're ready to take my place.

11:06.080 --> 11:10.200
But that day hasn't come yet.
So be patient, son.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.640
[cell phone chimes]

11:26.000 --> 11:27.320
[Hayley] Hey, Alex, slow down.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.920
[Alex] You know I can't stay mad at you.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.920
[Hayley] I know you can't.
But I'll say it again.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.240
I'm sorry.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.200
Wow.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.320
It's been forever since we've been here.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.160
- [sighs]
- I mean, when was that picnic?

11:42.800 --> 11:45.080
I don't know. I think I was five.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.160
[Hayley] That's when Mom
told us about the meteor.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.400
[Alex] Remember what Dad said?

11:49.480 --> 11:54.080
"No one knew about this place for millions
of years until your mom found it."

11:54.160 --> 11:55.400
[chuckles] Yep.

11:55.480 --> 11:59.880
"She made history at the age of 16."
No pressure there.

12:01.960 --> 12:07.440
[sighs] Now all I'm doing is doing dirty
politics for the Eagles' captain election.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.920
Yeah. It's that ugly?

12:09.000 --> 12:12.520
I convinced Daniel
to have Parker run for captain,

12:13.560 --> 12:15.320
but he's not qualified at all.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.920
See, that's a moral dilemma.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.040
It's not like smashing
a train into a car.

12:19.800 --> 12:20.920
What?

12:21.480 --> 12:23.880
Nothing. Sorry. What were you saying?

12:23.960 --> 12:27.000
Anyway, I want to vote for Sophie,

12:27.080 --> 12:29.520
but I don't want to betray
Daniel and Parker.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.880
I think you need to be true to yourself.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.920
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.920
All right, I have to get back.
They're gonna start voting soon.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.720
I wish we were voting for a new captain.

12:44.800 --> 12:49.240
Really? What's wrong with Leo?
I thought you two were close.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.320
Come on, Hayley. Spill it.
What's going on?

12:57.800 --> 13:01.080
I can't believe I'm gossiping about
my love life with my little brother.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.200
Pretend I'm Mere.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.400
[chuckles]

13:05.000 --> 13:07.240
- That was actually spot on.
- Yeah.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.680
[sighs] It's nothing.

13:11.480 --> 13:15.600
We kissed, and now he's dissing me.

13:16.840 --> 13:17.840
Did you brush your teeth?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.640
- [chuckles]
- Moron.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.400
I'm sorry I took your Louie.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.160
I know.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.360
And I'm sorry for not letting you
fight your own battles.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.520
Go! Don't you have an election to fix?

13:41.600 --> 13:43.720
- I'll let you know how it goes.
- [chuckles]

13:50.600 --> 13:52.040
[sighs]

13:53.480 --> 13:54.760
Well?

13:55.360 --> 13:56.760
How bad is it?

13:56.840 --> 13:59.560
Very bad. I've asked everybody.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.400
Nobody wants Parker.
It's gonna be a landslide for Sophie.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.880
Who's even voting for her?

14:03.960 --> 14:05.680
All right, look,
maybe I can get their names and just...

14:05.760 --> 14:07.440
Stop it, Daniel. It's over.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.480
So humiliating. Gosh.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.320
- It doesn't have to be.
- What do you mean?

14:15.640 --> 14:18.520
I think we should tell Parker to quit
the race before the votes are counted

14:18.600 --> 14:20.240
and give your full support to Sophie.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.200
On what grounds?

14:22.280 --> 14:23.920
You should tell everyone
you thought about it

14:24.000 --> 14:27.120
and decided to support
the first female captain of the Eagles.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.320
This way,
instead of coming off as a loser,

14:30.400 --> 14:31.760
you'll look like a hero.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.120
Who knew you were
such the manipulator, kid?

14:35.680 --> 14:37.520
[sighs] But how do
we even tell Parker this?

14:37.600 --> 14:40.360
Are you kidding? He'll be relieved.
He's in agony.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.240
Here he comes.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.080
So I was thinking...

14:44.800 --> 14:49.480
What if we have a taco party
to celebrate the results tonight, right?

14:50.480 --> 14:51.800
Listen, uh, Parker.

14:51.880 --> 14:56.160
I was also thinking, and, um,
you really don't have to do this.

14:56.240 --> 14:59.320
What are you talking about?
I'm psyched!

14:59.400 --> 15:00.920
- You are?
- Yeah.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.320
I mean, because I know
I pressured you into this,

15:03.400 --> 15:04.520
and honestly, when it comes...

15:04.600 --> 15:08.480
Relax, bro, okay. I know I was
all nervous and stuff earlier,

15:08.560 --> 15:10.880
but now I can feel it.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.720
I'm gonna win this for you, D.

15:17.560 --> 15:18.880
What?

15:20.240 --> 15:23.280
- I spoke to Brandon Thomas.
- [clicks tongue] Oh.

15:23.360 --> 15:26.800
He's giving a speech in Ryan's memory
just before the launch.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.560
[chuckles]

15:28.640 --> 15:32.800
Okay, that just gave me goosebumps,
mmm-hmm. [Chuckles]

15:32.880 --> 15:36.320
Wow. What an honor.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.160
I mean, this...
this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.240
It is.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.720
[chuckles]

15:42.480 --> 15:44.040
Oh, you know what would be a good idea?

15:44.120 --> 15:46.880
If maybe you got some
sleep for a change.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.720
Yeah, 'cause it would be a shame
if you just missed it.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.360
[both chuckle]

15:52.160 --> 15:55.040
Actually, I think my son wouldn't be
too upset if that happened.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.120
Jason? Why would you say that?

15:58.200 --> 16:01.720
I'm kidding.
But he did want to go in my place.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.240
Mmm.

16:03.320 --> 16:07.000
We had kind of an argument about it.
He feels I don't trust him.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.480
I'm sure he'll understand.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.240
He knows that you'll do
what's best for him.

16:11.320 --> 16:12.520
I hope so.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.680
You know, it reminds me of my Daniel.

16:19.360 --> 16:22.160
I never had the opportunity
to learn how to swim,

16:23.160 --> 16:25.280
so it was really important to me
that Daniel did.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.800
So when he turned six,

16:27.880 --> 16:31.240
his swimming instructor had the
parents hold our children's hands

16:31.320 --> 16:33.600
and guide them
across the shallow end of the pool.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.080
We were supposed to let go halfway

16:36.160 --> 16:38.960
so they could swim
the rest of the way themselves.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.000
But he cried every time.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.720
And I just couldn't bear
to see my son cry,

16:45.800 --> 16:49.000
so... [inhales sharply]
I wouldn't let go.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.400
You know, after a while,
he didn't want to go there anymore,

16:51.480 --> 16:53.000
and I didn't force him.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.800
But he never learned
how to properly swim.

16:57.560 --> 17:00.120
And it's probably my fault.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.000
- You can't blame yourself.
- [chuckles]

17:03.080 --> 17:05.640
You were simply being
a protective mother.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.560
Mmm. Yeah, maybe too protective.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.118
Maybe I should have just let him go.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.160
See, you got it. You got it.
You've just gotta shake it out.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.720
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

17:19.400 --> 17:20.880
All right, listen up, Eagles.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.200
Parker has a short announcement to make.

17:25.319 --> 17:26.640
Come on, bro.

17:30.760 --> 17:31.960
I...

17:34.080 --> 17:36.040
I've decided to withdraw from the race.

17:36.120 --> 17:36.960
What?

17:37.040 --> 17:39.480
We have a rare opportunity
to make history

17:39.560 --> 17:41.920
with the first female captain
of the Eagles.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.400
And I want to be
a part of that opportunity.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.160
- Sophie!
- Oh, my God. Parker.

17:46.240 --> 17:49.040
I wasn't expecting that.
I'm honored.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.000
[applauding]

17:52.160 --> 17:55.320
I'm proud to present
the new captain of the Eagles.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.760
Everyone, give it up for Sophie Cardona.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.240
[all cheering]

18:02.600 --> 18:04.960
[Sophie laughs] Thank you so much.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.000
Thanks, Parker.
I'll never forget this.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.480
We cool?

18:13.560 --> 18:15.640
- Always.
- [chuckles] All right.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.880
Leo. Hayley.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.560
These are for you.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.240
You've been chosen to attend
the NASA satellite launch tomorrow.

18:30.320 --> 18:33.320
It was a highly selective process.
You should be very proud.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.680
Just the two of us?

18:35.760 --> 18:37.080
The three of us.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.280
My father wanted me
to represent the school.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.760
I'll see you in the morning.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.880
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you, Alex.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.400
Souvenir?

19:06.480 --> 19:08.080
It's actually for the
Greenhouse archives.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.240
I wanted to make
Sophie's contribution special

19:10.320 --> 19:11.920
because she's the first female captain.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.560
- Hmm. Cool.
- Hmm.

19:14.160 --> 19:18.000
So you were the mastermind who convinced
Daniel and Parker to resign, right?

19:19.560 --> 19:22.720
[chuckles] You're a good influence
on Daniel.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.480
I'm really glad you came
to the Greenhouse, Alex.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.640
[Alex] You should, um, put this here.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.200
[Brooke and Alex chuckling]

19:39.400 --> 19:43.080
How did you convince Louis
to let Jason go instead of him?

19:43.760 --> 19:45.560
I did what I had to do.

19:45.640 --> 19:48.800
Now you just have to figure out
how to take that satellite down.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.480
Just like we took down
Ryan's spacecraft.
