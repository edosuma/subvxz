02:27.917 --> 02:31.083
-How're my Reds looking this year, Joe?
-Sucking hind teat.

02:31.292 --> 02:32.667
Yankees re-signed Ruth.

02:33.542 --> 02:35.333
35,000 dollars, you believe that?

02:35.417 --> 02:38.125
A man can work ten lifetimes
and not earn that kind of dough.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.417
-I could grow old on that.
-Amen.

03:16.792 --> 03:17.875
Hamilton!

03:17.958 --> 03:20.125
Where you been? Get your ass over here!

03:22.042 --> 03:25.542
-Crowson, Hamilton's out of group again.
-I'll take him back. Ray, come on!

03:28.500 --> 03:29.375
Drop your rifle.

03:30.917 --> 03:31.958
Drop it.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.667
Joe...

04:18.208 --> 04:19.083
Wait!

04:25.458 --> 04:26.292
Wait!

04:27.000 --> 04:28.250
They've escaped!

04:28.667 --> 04:30.667
-We have three in the clearing!
-Come on!

04:32.125 --> 04:33.083
Wait!

04:46.292 --> 04:48.875
-Care to comment on the escape, Governor?
-Morning, boys.

04:48.958 --> 04:51.042
Ma,
no one's ever broken out of your prison,

04:51.125 --> 04:52.750
and Bonnie and Clyde break in?

04:52.833 --> 04:54.583
They've been on the run for two years.

04:54.667 --> 04:57.625
Never say die, boys.
Say damned, never say die.

04:57.708 --> 05:00.333
Some folks are saying
that Parker and Barrow are heroes,

05:00.417 --> 05:01.625
calling them Robin Hoods.

05:01.708 --> 05:03.250
Are they Robin Hoods, Ma?

05:05.375 --> 05:08.542
Did Robin Hood ever shoot
a gas station attendant point-blank

05:08.625 --> 05:11.417
in the head for four dollars
and a tank of gas?

05:12.750 --> 05:15.417
We will capture Clyde Barrow
and his paramour.

05:15.792 --> 05:17.750
Write that down and underline it twice.

05:18.458 --> 05:19.333
Governor!

05:22.417 --> 05:23.917
-Governor!
-One more question!

05:40.042 --> 05:43.042
If today was a fish,
I'd throw the son of a bitch back.

05:45.667 --> 05:48.625
-How did it happen?
-Clyde did a nickel at Eastham.

05:48.708 --> 05:49.750
He knew the system.

05:49.833 --> 05:52.292
Planted guns,
ran it like a military operation.

05:52.375 --> 05:53.375
Where are we on this?

05:53.458 --> 05:56.750
-Hoover and the Feds are proceeding--
-Where are we on this?

05:56.833 --> 05:59.417
-Dallas detectives, highway patrol--
-Ma Ferguson Agents--

05:59.500 --> 06:02.458
Same as we've had for the past six months,
with no end in sight.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.375
They busted into your facility, Lee.

06:05.375 --> 06:09.208
You're right, they did.
Wounded one of my guards, killed another.

06:09.292 --> 06:12.042
Died in my arms,
apologizing for letting me down.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.167
I'd like a say in how we handle this.

06:17.958 --> 06:19.917
Fine. Let's hear it.

06:21.333 --> 06:26.000
Was a time we put a pair of man-killers
on the trail and let them do their job.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.583
Texas Rangers.

06:27.833 --> 06:30.792
Was a time, and that time's passed.

06:30.875 --> 06:33.000
This is 1934, Lee,

06:33.125 --> 06:35.708
and you want to put cowboys
on Bonnie and Clyde?

06:35.792 --> 06:38.458
-Is that what you're selling?
-Frank Hamer.

06:39.125 --> 06:40.542
That's what I'm selling.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.875
Well, sure.
Why don't we just go dig up Wyatt Earp?

06:44.958 --> 06:46.042
Wild Bill Hickok.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.667
Legislature disbanded the Rangers, Lee.

06:48.750 --> 06:51.542
-And you're right proud of it, aren't you?
-Damn right, I am.

06:51.625 --> 06:55.250
They took orders from no one,
and they left me to answer for the blood.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.792
Seems like you're answering for it again.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.167
Governor,

07:01.833 --> 07:04.375
Bonnie and Clyde have been
on the road for two years.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.125
Cold-blooded killers who are more adored
than movie stars.

07:09.167 --> 07:10.292
This has to stop.

07:22.917 --> 07:23.792
Well...

07:25.625 --> 07:26.625
Where is he?

08:13.417 --> 08:16.542
This sure don't look
like no famous gunfighter's house.

08:16.625 --> 08:19.500
Well, most gunfighters end up living
in a pine box,

08:19.583 --> 08:22.500
but Hamer married well and did just fine

08:22.583 --> 08:25.250
in private security
with the oil companies.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.833
Doesn't sound like he needs a job, sir.

08:33.042 --> 08:35.083
No, Luther, I suppose it doesn't.

08:41.917 --> 08:44.042
-What in the good holy hell?
-Porky!

08:44.125 --> 08:45.708
No!

08:47.542 --> 08:48.667
He ain't gonna bite.

08:48.917 --> 08:49.792
Frank.

08:50.833 --> 08:51.667
Lee.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
It's quite the watchdog you got there.

08:54.083 --> 08:54.917
He's a gift.

08:55.125 --> 08:57.875
Widow in Alpine.
Too tough to eat. Wouldn't run off.

08:57.958 --> 09:01.167
Gladdie hates him,
but he's my friend, not hers.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.250
Go on. Back in the house.

09:05.833 --> 09:06.708
Speaking of...

09:07.250 --> 09:08.167
how's Gault?

09:09.333 --> 09:10.208
Speaking of what?

09:11.250 --> 09:12.083
Friends.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.583
Don't know. No idea where he is.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.875
Lubbock. Maney's in Lubbock.

09:18.333 --> 09:19.417
What brings you?

09:20.250 --> 09:22.833
You may have heard
there was a prison break. Huntsville?

09:22.917 --> 09:25.667
Well, Ma Ferguson pardons 100 convicts
a month.

09:26.500 --> 09:30.375
They could've just signed her a check,
saved themselves a lot of trouble.

09:30.875 --> 09:34.750
It was the Barrow Gang done it.
Bonnie and Clyde.

09:34.833 --> 09:38.583
Nobody can put a net over 'em.
A thousand men in the field right now.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.000
He must be good.

09:40.958 --> 09:42.875
Got the drop on six peace officers so far.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.417
What can I do for you?

09:46.250 --> 09:47.500
Put 'em on the spot.

09:49.208 --> 09:50.417
Yeah, don't...

09:51.292 --> 09:54.292
Don't mention that idea
inside the governor's mansion,

09:54.375 --> 09:55.625
not unless you wanna be laughed at.

09:55.708 --> 09:58.458
I did, and they did.
But she'll back me up on this.

09:59.750 --> 10:02.583
-She gonna bring back the Rangers?
-No, never.

10:03.625 --> 10:04.958
What capacity, then?

10:05.458 --> 10:06.917
Special highway assignment.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.750
Special highway assignment. Highwaymen?

10:13.083 --> 10:16.333
What's the pay these days, $150 a month?

10:16.708 --> 10:19.750
A hundred and thirty.
It don't matter what badge you got, Frank.

10:19.833 --> 10:21.667
We need you
to put 'em out of business.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.500
I thought you and Maney.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.625
He's killed six law?

10:29.833 --> 10:31.792
You're gonna have to put this man down.

10:31.875 --> 10:34.708
The governor says you'll have authority
to do whatever's necessary.

10:34.792 --> 10:35.792
Those are her words.

10:35.875 --> 10:39.083
I'm sorry, Lee, but I made a promise.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.292
Well, Lee Simmons, as I live and breathe.

10:45.375 --> 10:47.750
We live in the same town, never see you.

10:47.958 --> 10:48.917
Hello, Gladys.

10:49.542 --> 10:51.250
You look lovely, as always.

10:54.042 --> 10:56.083
-What, are you feeding an army?
-Yeah.

10:56.167 --> 10:57.542
Ladies Auxiliary.

10:59.750 --> 11:04.042
Look at my new Henry Ford, Lee.
Eighty-five horses. Ain't she fun?

11:04.125 --> 11:05.917
Yes, ma'am, she certainly is.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
What brings you out?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.667
Oh, come by, say hello.

11:10.333 --> 11:13.292
Lady Governor's offering me $130 a month,
Gladdie.

11:13.583 --> 11:14.458
To do what?

11:16.167 --> 11:17.792
Hunt down Bonnie and Clyde.

11:23.833 --> 11:26.042
-I'd best get back to my office.
-You'd best.

11:45.333 --> 11:46.625
Something you wanna say?

11:47.625 --> 11:48.917
I'm gonna repaint the kitchen.

11:53.417 --> 11:55.208
That's what's on your mind, huh?

11:55.875 --> 11:57.458
Yellow, I think.

13:01.833 --> 13:02.958
Dear Lord.

13:06.667 --> 13:09.542
<i>How about your fried egg? Is it too small?</i>

13:09.833 --> 13:12.167
<i>-No, it's big enough.</i>
-<i>Well, it's a hen's egg.</i>

13:12.542 --> 13:13.667
<i>But if it's too small,</i>

13:13.750 --> 13:16.167
<i>I'll get the rooster here</i>
<i>and squeeze one out of him.</i>

13:17.750 --> 13:20.375
<i>We interrupt this broadcast</i>
<i>to bring you a CBS news report.</i>

13:20.458 --> 13:22.292
Told you it looked like tornado weather.

13:22.375 --> 13:25.042
<i>Police in Reed Springs, Missouri,</i>
<i>report a harrowing shoot-out</i>

13:25.125 --> 13:28.708
<i>between gangsters Bonnie and Clyde</i>
<i>and officers of the law.</i>

13:28.875 --> 13:31.167
<i>The lawless lovers fired hundreds</i>
<i>of machine-gun rounds</i>

13:31.250 --> 13:32.667
<i>at the outnumbered officers.</i>

13:32.750 --> 13:34.875
<i>No report yet on the number of fatalities.</i>

13:35.292 --> 13:37.125
<i>We now return</i>
<i>to your regular scheduled program.</i>

14:16.083 --> 14:17.875
You boys work for Old Salazar?

14:17.958 --> 14:21.292
Yes, sir.
Mend the fence, cut Johnsongrass.

14:23.250 --> 14:25.583
-I think I've seen you before.
-Yeah.

14:26.042 --> 14:28.250
He sent me out here
to give you boys a break.

14:31.875 --> 14:32.917
Come on, fellas.

14:43.625 --> 14:45.667
-Which one of you has an arm?
-I do.

14:46.292 --> 14:47.458
Take them bottles out,

14:47.542 --> 14:49.625
see if you can't get a couple up high
for me.

14:49.708 --> 14:51.125
All right, and just...

14:51.292 --> 14:53.000
How about every one I hit,

14:53.833 --> 14:54.792
you get a nickel?

14:58.042 --> 14:59.000
Let her rip.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.167
Yeah, let's do another one.

15:25.583 --> 15:26.583
Well, for pity's sake.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.042
I'm a goddamn old man.

15:44.083 --> 15:45.083
All right.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.208
Let her go.

15:55.542 --> 15:56.708
You got a piece of that.

15:58.750 --> 15:59.917
Yes, I did.

16:01.250 --> 16:02.417
Just a piece.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.167
Go ahead.

16:07.917 --> 16:08.750
Take it, boys.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.500
It's for keeping your mouth shut.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.333
Yes, sir.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.292
Can you bring me that bag there?

16:20.583 --> 16:21.667
Hey, mister.

16:23.042 --> 16:24.667
Was you really Frank Hamer?

16:28.417 --> 16:29.417
Yep.

16:30.042 --> 16:33.042
You boys best get back to work, okay?
Go on, there.

16:34.958 --> 16:36.875
The look on his face!

16:39.792 --> 16:41.167
Gladys is lovely,

16:41.500 --> 16:43.500
but Captain Hamer is such a grump.

16:45.375 --> 16:49.083
-Mrs. Hamer, may I help you with anything?
-Keep Leanne from spiking that punch.

16:56.125 --> 16:57.000
Nice turnout.

16:59.750 --> 17:00.667
Where's Porky?

17:01.333 --> 17:03.333
Locked in the spare bedroom.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.083
I don't suppose there's any chance
you want to take him with you?

17:13.167 --> 17:15.708
Don't pretend
you didn't just hide this from me.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.458
I suppose you're gonna want to take
my new Ford.

17:27.750 --> 17:32.125
I could tell you you're too old for this,
or that it's not your affair,

17:33.667 --> 17:36.250
or that you hadn't held a gun
in quite a while.

17:38.042 --> 17:40.375
But I know that's all a waste of time,
so I won't.

17:40.708 --> 17:44.000
And I appreciate you not telling me
any of that.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.875
I'm sorry, Gladdie.

17:51.583 --> 17:52.417
Don't be.

17:53.917 --> 17:55.875
I knew what you were when I married you.

18:01.042 --> 18:03.917
Oh, I packed sandwiches.
They're in the icebox.

18:09.042 --> 18:09.917
Thank you.

18:38.333 --> 18:39.625
Something else.

18:41.292 --> 18:42.917
If you're covering miles, keep oil in her.

18:43.833 --> 18:44.708
Yes, ma'am.

18:51.583 --> 18:53.500
Those two scare me, Frank.

18:59.792 --> 19:00.667
You tell me.

19:05.917 --> 19:07.042
I'll come back.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.500
Too good to come to my office?

19:44.125 --> 19:46.167
All the same,
I'd rather keep this low-key.

19:47.583 --> 19:48.417
Files.

19:49.458 --> 19:51.583
Here's your authorization, right there.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.208
Your jurisdiction technically ends
at the state line and the border.

19:55.833 --> 19:56.792
Technically.

19:59.167 --> 20:01.083
-Guess this is my badge?
-Yep.

20:02.333 --> 20:05.833
You will keep me posted?
Call me from the road?

20:06.542 --> 20:07.708
I'll call you when.

20:13.125 --> 20:16.917
Where are you headed to first?
Texarkana? El Paso? Dallas?

20:17.708 --> 20:18.542
Lubbock?

22:24.833 --> 22:26.250
Wake up, Pop-Pop.

22:28.792 --> 22:29.750
Yeah.

22:30.292 --> 22:34.625
Mama says you should get up for breakfast,
even if you don't have a job.

22:36.167 --> 22:38.208
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

22:45.875 --> 22:48.542
I've gotta take Dan over to see a man
about some work.

22:48.625 --> 22:51.583
Can you make sure Nate gets off to school
on time?

22:53.667 --> 22:56.833
Thinking about adding another bay
down at the garage.

22:57.833 --> 23:00.083
Pete said to call him in a few weeks.

23:00.375 --> 23:03.083
We're okay, Daddy. Really.

23:03.958 --> 23:06.458
No, I aim to pull my weight, thank you.

23:07.625 --> 23:08.667
Coming!

23:32.792 --> 23:34.125
Thanks, Pop-Pop.

23:35.625 --> 23:38.042
That's a dang good biscuit, right there.

24:08.208 --> 24:11.167
You fix cars. So you could fix Daddy's?

24:12.417 --> 24:14.667
I could if he'd ever let me near it.

24:15.417 --> 24:17.417
But you used to be famous, right?

24:21.208 --> 24:22.417
Who told you that?

24:22.500 --> 24:25.500
Timmy Hess.
He said you shot lots of folks.

24:26.583 --> 24:29.083
Oh, yeah? What else did Timmy have to say?

24:29.167 --> 24:32.042
Nothing,
just that you might go to hell for it.

24:36.958 --> 24:37.792
Go on.

25:29.417 --> 25:30.375
Morning.

25:31.917 --> 25:33.083
Can I help you?

25:36.167 --> 25:39.167
I'd like to have a look
at that Thompson submachine gun.

25:45.625 --> 25:47.583
And the Colt Monitor machine rifle,

25:47.667 --> 25:49.875
one up top there
with the custom pistol grip.

25:49.958 --> 25:50.792
Carter.

25:56.542 --> 25:58.417
The Colt automatic pistol.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.250
And 1917 Smith, right behind it.

26:03.875 --> 26:06.417
I'm gonna wanna see that BAR .30-06.

26:08.542 --> 26:11.583
And the '03 Springfield
with the glass, up top there.

26:12.917 --> 26:15.458
That Remington Model 11,
right gun over there.

26:15.542 --> 26:17.542
You want the 28-inch or the 20-inch?

26:17.625 --> 26:20.125
No, sir. I want the short barrel.

26:20.708 --> 26:22.333
-Is that the 12?
-Yes, sir.

26:22.458 --> 26:25.667
Let me see that older Winchester
you got there, that .30-30.

26:29.417 --> 26:30.292
I'll take it.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.875
I'll need one gun that won't jam.

26:42.958 --> 26:45.375
Would you be wanting the stick
or drum for the Tommy?

26:45.458 --> 26:47.292
-How many in the stick?
-Twenty rounds.

26:47.375 --> 26:50.042
I'll take a dozen. And two of them drums.

26:51.875 --> 26:54.875
And a handful of half-moon clips
for this Smith if you've got them.

26:54.958 --> 26:56.958
Do you have this in black
instead of nickel?

26:57.042 --> 26:58.083
Too damn shiny.

26:58.167 --> 26:59.792
I believe I do, sir.

27:00.333 --> 27:03.542
All right, then, that'll do it.

27:05.292 --> 27:07.208
-Which will do it?
-All of 'em.

27:08.333 --> 27:10.167
-All of 'em?
-Yes, sir.

27:10.917 --> 27:13.667
Along with four cases of 45 lead,

27:15.125 --> 27:16.750
same for the .30-06 and say...

27:18.333 --> 27:20.125
an even 100, each of the others.

27:20.208 --> 27:23.833
What are you going after
that you need all this firepower?

27:23.917 --> 27:27.375
-If you don't mind me asking.
-No, sir. I don't mind at all.

28:07.333 --> 28:08.375
How'd you know it was me?

28:08.667 --> 28:11.000
Between the suit and the car,

28:11.083 --> 28:14.458
I thought you was the bank
till I saw how poorly you drove.

28:18.833 --> 28:21.625
All them guns have anything
to do with that...

28:22.167 --> 28:23.917
jackass and his girlfriend?

28:25.250 --> 28:27.083
It as bad as the headlines?

28:29.292 --> 28:32.083
-Yeah.
-You came all the way up to the house.

28:32.625 --> 28:33.917
What changed your mind?

28:35.625 --> 28:38.542
I don't know, maybe seeing you move
like you're 85.

28:40.417 --> 28:41.750
Well, that's honest.

28:42.542 --> 28:44.625
Maybe a little too honest.

28:45.417 --> 28:50.000
You could've asked me, let me decide.
That would've been the polite thing to do.

28:50.083 --> 28:53.083
Well, like you said, I changed my mind.
Besides, what would your...

28:53.917 --> 28:56.167
What would your daughter say
if you ran off?

28:57.542 --> 28:59.000
That a weight's been lifted.

29:00.208 --> 29:02.500
You know how it goes.
I gotta live the way they do.

29:02.583 --> 29:05.750
This case, that means sleeping in the car,
driving thousands of miles a week.

29:06.542 --> 29:08.625
I don't sleep much anyway.

29:09.750 --> 29:12.833
When I do,
I almost always dream about dead Mexicans.

29:14.625 --> 29:17.000
-I think I'll look up Ledbetter.
-He's dead.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.667
-Or Cuthbert.
-Dead, too.

29:22.750 --> 29:26.417
So is Alvarez.
And if you go any further down the roster,

29:26.542 --> 29:28.250
I'm gonna be gravely offended.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.708
Dammit, Pancho, I'm above ground

29:31.458 --> 29:32.667
and ready to go.

29:34.125 --> 29:34.958
Unless you...

29:36.250 --> 29:37.625
think I'm useless.

29:40.125 --> 29:41.458
You in good spirits?

29:44.125 --> 29:47.125
Pretty polite way
of asking if I'm drinking.

29:48.000 --> 29:48.958
Well, are you?

29:51.333 --> 29:52.167
I'm not...

29:54.542 --> 29:55.375
holding.

29:57.333 --> 29:58.958
I could help with the driving.

29:59.042 --> 29:59.875
No.

29:59.958 --> 30:00.792
Or not.

30:06.667 --> 30:07.958
Ah, Judas Priest! Get in.

30:10.000 --> 30:10.917
But no singing.

30:13.125 --> 30:17.417
<i>I raised taxes to pay</i>
<i>for my new law enforcement program.</i>

30:17.500 --> 30:19.958
And the last thing
this administration needs

30:20.042 --> 30:22.708
is for a couple of<i></i>has-been vaqueros

30:22.792 --> 30:25.375
to make that program look anything less

30:25.458 --> 30:27.458
than stellar during this economic crisis.

30:28.667 --> 30:30.167
Nod if your ears are working.

30:30.417 --> 30:32.417
-We'll get your gangsters.
-You don't, John,

30:32.625 --> 30:35.042
you're gonna be on guard duty
at Eastham Prison Farm.

30:35.625 --> 30:38.833
Get Barrow off the damn road
before they do.

30:42.333 --> 30:44.500
-There she is!
-Why, here you all are!

30:44.583 --> 30:46.625
I'm so glad to see you!

30:46.917 --> 30:48.750
Get your checkbooks out!

30:48.833 --> 30:50.750
<i>...to the boss to get my roll</i>

30:50.833 --> 30:54.000
<i>He figured me out</i>
<i>Nine dollars in the hole</i>

30:58.083 --> 31:00.292
Mount Ayr, Iowa.

31:00.583 --> 31:02.375
Mount Ayr, Iowa.

31:09.125 --> 31:10.875
If you're getting tired, I could...

31:11.458 --> 31:12.292
dr--

31:14.292 --> 31:15.125
Just saying.

31:17.333 --> 31:21.917
Hey, you think it was them
robbed that armory up there?

31:24.042 --> 31:25.042
It's a good chance.

31:25.125 --> 31:28.125
Stole a car in Illinois.
Shot their way out of a roadblock.

31:28.208 --> 31:30.667
They've been following
these same loops for three years.

31:30.750 --> 31:32.292
North to Kansas or Iowa,

31:32.375 --> 31:34.208
east to Illinois or Indiana,

31:34.292 --> 31:35.458
south to Arkansas.

31:36.542 --> 31:38.917
Then right back to Texas
to start over again.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.750
We got no jurisdiction north of Red River.

31:42.083 --> 31:45.500
Maybe Hoover will take 'em up there.
Carthage.

31:46.667 --> 31:47.542
Carthage...

31:47.792 --> 31:49.292
Carthage, Missouri.

31:49.375 --> 31:54.667
Hell, I don't remember a saddle being
as hard on a man's ass as these seats.

32:02.417 --> 32:05.292
I never shot a girl before, Pancho.

32:08.125 --> 32:10.500
If we can take Clyde long-range, she'll...

32:11.833 --> 32:13.125
She'll surrender.

32:15.708 --> 32:17.667
We're gonna shoot a man
without fair warning?

32:17.750 --> 32:19.167
Well, Lord knows he does.

32:19.250 --> 32:22.292
Yeah, well, Lord knows
that's what separates us from him.

32:27.208 --> 32:28.333
Clarksdale, Mississippi.

32:30.750 --> 32:32.583
-Where next?
-Where they're headed.

32:34.917 --> 32:35.792
Home.

33:00.625 --> 33:02.083
West Dallas Viaduct.

33:07.583 --> 33:09.125
The Devil's Back Porch.

33:11.750 --> 33:14.208
And I thought my circumstances were bad.

33:17.583 --> 33:18.917
Let me see the file.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.167
Bernal Street.

33:25.250 --> 33:26.917
That's her momma's house, there.

33:30.042 --> 33:31.833
They're real close to one another.

33:35.708 --> 33:39.292
Should be the Barrows up on the corner.
Eagle Ford Road.

33:56.708 --> 34:00.250
Says here the two families talked
on the telephone once a day

34:00.500 --> 34:01.792
till about a week ago.

34:01.875 --> 34:03.625
And how the hell they know that?

34:05.417 --> 34:06.500
Federal wiretaps.

34:07.708 --> 34:12.042
G-men can hook up to the party lines
and record conversation now.

34:12.125 --> 34:13.000
No.

34:15.417 --> 34:16.542
I'll be goddamned.

34:19.667 --> 34:20.708
Pancho.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.417
What's this kid up to?

34:56.542 --> 34:57.375
Pancho!

35:59.958 --> 36:02.833
-Gotta grab him quick.
-Whoa there, boy! Where do you belong?

36:30.458 --> 36:32.667
Were you...<i></i>chasing someone?

36:33.667 --> 36:35.792
Jim Thorpe. Who are you?

36:35.875 --> 36:38.500
John Quinn, State Ferguson Agent.

36:38.958 --> 36:41.625
This is Kendale,
US Bureau of Investigation.

36:42.042 --> 36:44.250
We heard you were
on special assignment, sir.

36:44.333 --> 36:45.833
Director Hoover sends his regards.

36:45.917 --> 36:48.667
He also sends a tip
by way of his contacts down south.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.292
-What's going on?
-Ask him.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.042
You okay?

36:58.125 --> 36:59.667
I thought you had my back.

37:00.083 --> 37:01.625
I would have been dead by now.

37:01.708 --> 37:04.542
You ran one more block, we'd both be dead.

37:04.625 --> 37:05.708
Our information tells us

37:05.792 --> 37:08.042
that Barrow might be hiding out
in Brownsville.

37:08.583 --> 37:09.625
You probably weren't aware,

37:09.708 --> 37:11.875
but this is
a highly-coordinated operation.

37:11.958 --> 37:14.792
That said, we're happy
for any help you two might give us.

37:16.250 --> 37:19.333
-Down in Brownsville.
-You ever hunt wild horses, Quinn?

37:21.042 --> 37:22.042
What?

37:22.583 --> 37:23.625
God!

37:24.333 --> 37:25.167
Jeez!

37:25.625 --> 37:29.417
They hunt a big range,
but they always come home.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.625
We've got a thousand-person dragnet
in full operation.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.583
Roadblocks, air surveillance.

37:33.667 --> 37:36.000
Don't think the Barrow Gang's
gonna be coming back to the neighborhood

37:36.083 --> 37:36.917
any time soon.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.333
No, sir. Outlaws and mustangs,

37:39.917 --> 37:41.625
they always come home.

37:41.708 --> 37:43.583
Maybe you gentlemen should go home,
too.

37:44.458 --> 37:45.583
This isn't Llano County.

37:45.667 --> 37:48.625
Be a shame if either of you got hurt
in retirement.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.042
It'd be a shame if anybody got hurt.

37:58.208 --> 37:59.667
Sir, if I could,

37:59.750 --> 38:03.083
I think what Detective Quinn means is
the Barrow Gang just hit an armory.

38:03.167 --> 38:04.500
They're armed to kill.

38:08.542 --> 38:10.708
That's called a double-band system.

38:11.875 --> 38:14.125
Didn't have one
in your saddlebags, I imagine.

38:14.208 --> 38:16.208
It's essential in a dragnet.

38:16.958 --> 38:19.208
Without it,
you might as well be in Timbuktu.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.083
Or down in Brownsville,

38:23.167 --> 38:24.833
following your bullshit tip.

38:35.917 --> 38:38.083
-I've felt more welcome.
-Yeah.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.042
Maybe we ought to make new friends.

38:44.042 --> 38:45.500
Smoot Schmid, gentlemen.

38:45.583 --> 38:47.500
No need to introduce yourselves,
I know who you are,

38:47.583 --> 38:50.208
but I'd be honored
to shake your hands anyway.

38:50.750 --> 38:53.833
-Howdy.
-Bob Alcorn, there. And Deputy Ted Hinton,

38:53.917 --> 38:55.583
holding up the Cola machine.

38:56.625 --> 38:57.458
Have a seat.

38:59.708 --> 39:00.542
Damn.

39:01.333 --> 39:02.542
Hamer and Gault.

39:03.167 --> 39:05.292
Know how many times
I have told my grandson

39:05.375 --> 39:06.375
the Candelaria story?

39:06.458 --> 39:09.083
Every night before bed,
that's what he wants to hear.

39:09.167 --> 39:10.625
And I mean every night.

39:11.042 --> 39:12.500
And how's he sleep?

39:14.250 --> 39:16.750
Sheriff, we're involved
in the Barrow manhunt...

39:17.375 --> 39:18.750
in a very private way.

39:18.833 --> 39:20.792
It's not too private. Word gets around.

39:20.875 --> 39:21.708
Yes, it does.

39:21.792 --> 39:23.792
We heard that Clyde put a price
on your head.

39:23.875 --> 39:25.292
I keep my front door unlocked

39:25.375 --> 39:27.667
in case that son of a bitch
ever wants to stop by.

39:31.625 --> 39:33.333
We're gonna take him down.

39:34.750 --> 39:35.750
But we need your help.

39:36.208 --> 39:37.542
I would be honored.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.792
We're looking for confidence

39:39.875 --> 39:43.125
in the neighborhood.
Someone who knows the families

39:43.208 --> 39:45.083
and willing to talk.

39:46.083 --> 39:48.750
Well, how about a boy they grew up with?

39:48.833 --> 39:52.208
That worked with Clyde,
known Bonnie ever since she was a girl.

39:52.792 --> 39:55.625
A boy that can give you
a positive identification on 'em

39:55.708 --> 39:56.750
from first sighting.

39:57.083 --> 40:01.125
Now, he's got the mental range
of a windshield wiper,

40:01.583 --> 40:02.542
but he's reliable.

40:04.083 --> 40:05.333
Where can we find him?

40:05.833 --> 40:07.125
Holding up the Cola machine.

40:10.417 --> 40:11.583
<i>Tough place to grow up.</i>

40:11.833 --> 40:13.375
Clyde was always mischief.

40:13.917 --> 40:16.125
You know, me and him
used to play cops and robbers.

40:16.375 --> 40:18.333
Let me guess, you was the cop.

40:19.167 --> 40:20.625
All I ever wanted to be.

40:20.750 --> 40:22.750
That or shortstop
for the Cleveland Indians.

40:23.833 --> 40:27.375
And Bonnie, you... You know Miss Parker?

40:27.458 --> 40:31.792
She grew up on the backside of the Porch,
near Cement City. No daddy.

40:31.875 --> 40:35.500
-Must be one hard lady.
-To the contrary, sir. Little bitty thing.

40:35.583 --> 40:38.583
I mean, can't weigh but 90 pounds.
Smartest girl in school.

40:38.667 --> 40:40.917
She was in all the plays.
Won the spelling bees.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.750
-Yeah.
-Wrote poetry.

40:42.833 --> 40:43.708
Yeah.

40:43.792 --> 40:46.500
I mean, attractive girl.
Taffy-colored hair.

40:46.583 --> 40:49.292
Sounds like the shortstop
was maybe a little sweet on her.

40:49.375 --> 40:52.333
Any boy she ever waited on
at the Courthouse Café was sweet on her.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.875
How'd she fall in
with an outlaw like Barrow?

40:55.750 --> 40:59.000
Bored to tears.
Along come Clyde in a fine car.

40:59.083 --> 41:01.667
By the time she found out
the car was stolen, she was in love.

41:01.750 --> 41:03.000
Ain't that romantic.

41:03.083 --> 41:05.875
I met my wife,
she was milking a prize Devon

41:05.958 --> 41:07.708
at the Oklahoma State Fair.

41:08.250 --> 41:10.750
I can't imagine anybody writing a ballad

41:10.833 --> 41:12.250
about that encounter.

41:15.333 --> 41:18.167
You know, the files say
they ran two of your roadblocks.

41:19.667 --> 41:22.208
Well, they ran roadblocks
in Oklahoma, too.

41:22.542 --> 41:24.292
Kansas, New Mexico.

41:25.542 --> 41:27.875
Also said you had a clear shot at 'em.

41:30.500 --> 41:33.250
They say Clyde is some sort of Fu Manchu.

41:33.708 --> 41:35.083
You know, can't be touched.

41:35.792 --> 41:38.583
<i>Time Magazine </i>called him superhuman.
Y'all see that?

41:38.917 --> 41:41.083
Maybe you weren't able to pull on her,
Ted.

41:41.750 --> 41:42.583
Sir?

41:43.750 --> 41:47.750
Couldn't pull the trigger on a nice girl
who used to serve you pecan pie

41:47.833 --> 41:49.833
at the Courthouse Café.

41:50.542 --> 41:52.042
You're not able to do it.

41:53.083 --> 41:56.667
Well, I won't have to.
I'm stationed right here in West Dallas.

41:56.750 --> 41:58.708
It'll be a cold day in hell
before they show their faces

41:58.792 --> 42:01.250
-on the Back Porch.
-Well, they're on their way, Ted.

42:01.542 --> 42:04.083
According to the wiretaps,
Mrs. Parker's cooking red beans

42:04.167 --> 42:05.917
and cabbage Easter Sunday.

42:06.083 --> 42:07.542
Sir, I don't understand.

42:08.542 --> 42:11.208
Ted, you don't know what wiretaps are?

42:11.667 --> 42:13.167
I know what wiretaps are!

42:13.250 --> 42:16.042
I don't understand what red beans
and cabbage have to do with it.

42:16.125 --> 42:17.500
Whenever Bonnie's momma says

42:17.583 --> 42:19.458
that she has red beans
and cabbage on the stove,

42:19.542 --> 42:20.750
those dates, they match up

42:20.833 --> 42:23.875
to sightings or shoot-outs
in the general Dallas area.

42:23.958 --> 42:27.292
Red beans and cabbage, that's code.
Means the kids are coming home.

42:30.500 --> 42:31.708
Do I ride with you boys?

42:31.792 --> 42:34.708
No, sir. We'll meet you in two days,
Easter Sunday.

42:34.792 --> 42:37.542
Meet us first thing in the morning,
a block from Eagle Ford Road.

42:37.625 --> 42:39.917
I'll need you to make the ID
on Barrow and Parker.

42:40.000 --> 42:40.833
I'm your man.

42:44.125 --> 42:45.333
They're afraid to shoot the girl.

42:46.833 --> 42:49.000
Gives Clyde the second he needs
to get the drop,

42:49.083 --> 42:51.667
and toothpick there knows it.

42:56.417 --> 43:00.500
"You've read the story of Jesse James
and how he lived and died.

43:00.583 --> 43:05.042
Still in the need of something to read?
Here's the story of Bonnie and Clyde."

43:05.208 --> 43:09.292
Man, used to be,
you had to have talent to get published.

43:09.375 --> 43:11.958
Now, you just have to shoot people.

43:21.042 --> 43:22.250
What is this place?

43:27.208 --> 43:29.750
They were sighted
a month or two ago camping...

43:30.542 --> 43:32.167
Camping somewhere out here.

43:36.958 --> 43:38.708
Somebody's a damn good eye.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.708
Well, that
or they just walked right up to it.

43:53.625 --> 43:54.458
Look at that.

43:55.250 --> 43:59.333
-Every shot right through the same hole.
-When's the last time you fired that?

43:59.917 --> 44:01.500
You know what we're up against?

44:01.875 --> 44:02.750
Any idea?

44:03.292 --> 44:05.458
Ain't nothing we ain't seen before,
Pancho.

44:05.542 --> 44:09.667
There was a shoot-out in Joplin.
Over a thousand rounds were fired.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.250
What the hell is that?

44:17.708 --> 44:19.792
It's a Colt Monitor machine rifle.

44:20.417 --> 44:23.083
Fires a twenty-round volley
at 3,000 feet per second.

44:23.583 --> 44:26.917
Our boy, Clyde,
he prefers a Browning Automatic .30 cal.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.125
Pretty much the same gun,
except now the little shit uses a...

44:31.292 --> 44:32.917
welded over-and-under clip

44:33.750 --> 44:35.000
that can fire 40.

44:36.792 --> 44:39.500
-Well, he ain't met Old Lucky.
-Shit, I ain't that lucky.

44:55.125 --> 44:56.792
Hey, got one of them for me?

45:39.000 --> 45:40.125
You folks all right?

46:14.167 --> 46:15.083
Happy Easter.

46:15.167 --> 46:16.042
I gotta pee.

46:18.083 --> 46:21.542
Yeah, might be something left
after the 40 times you were up all night.

46:21.625 --> 46:25.250
Yeah, well, there's a place in heaven
for Gladys, the way you saw wood.

46:25.333 --> 46:26.458
When did you start that?

46:26.542 --> 46:27.375
Hurry up.

46:48.333 --> 46:50.333
Why don't you go inside and wait there?

47:09.542 --> 47:12.542
Barrow and Parker stayed put.
No one's really seen Clyde around.

47:12.625 --> 47:14.208
Don't be surprised, Ted.

47:14.292 --> 47:15.833
You wouldn't think Clyde would've noticed

47:15.917 --> 47:19.708
a little metal man leading a circus
through his old neighborhood?

47:21.917 --> 47:25.292
I hear there's red beans and cabbage
over at the Parker house

47:25.375 --> 47:27.042
if you're hungry, Captain Hamer.

47:27.125 --> 47:30.875
Maybe they rode in on their mustangs
and then rode back out again.

47:30.958 --> 47:32.500
Shots fired over near Grapevine.

47:32.750 --> 47:33.583
Officers down.

47:41.125 --> 47:42.417
I didn't say anything.

47:47.500 --> 47:48.458
Get in the car, Ted.

47:54.833 --> 47:57.542
How's the view from up there, Mr. Hoover?

47:57.875 --> 47:59.500
You high-flying sissy.

48:02.250 --> 48:04.500
The car was parked there all morning.

48:05.708 --> 48:08.167
The two officers pulled up...

48:24.875 --> 48:27.083
-Hold on.
-You explain it to him, Ted.

48:37.292 --> 48:40.917
-What do you make of that?
-Kid didn't get 'em into the gun.

48:52.500 --> 48:55.042
Get that to the field office
for fingerprint analysis.

48:55.125 --> 48:57.917
Careful where you step, cowboy.
It's an active crime scene.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.083
Kiss my ass.

49:02.125 --> 49:05.750
You were right.
Came back. Came right back to Dallas.

49:08.125 --> 49:09.000
Lettuce.

49:37.250 --> 49:38.667
Check the goddamn fence line.

49:42.833 --> 49:44.583
-What the hell are you doing?
-You still got two.

49:54.833 --> 49:57.667
Third gun, we think it's either Joe Palmer
or Ray Hamilton.

49:58.083 --> 50:00.417
We'll run ballistics,
and maybe we'll know something.

50:01.292 --> 50:03.583
No, tracks are too big
and deep for Palmer.

50:03.667 --> 50:04.958
These are driver's side.

50:12.833 --> 50:15.042
It may have to be Raymond
who shot that BAR.

50:15.708 --> 50:19.292
Yeah, heavy. I reckon Clyde used
a ten-gauge scattergun.

50:19.708 --> 50:21.208
Little girl used a sawed-off 20.

50:27.583 --> 50:28.708
You see that?

50:32.000 --> 50:33.333
She drags her left leg.

50:34.500 --> 50:35.333
She gimp?

50:36.500 --> 50:38.917
Well, Clyde missed a detour
a month or so back.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.792
Got her leg burned up in the wreck.

50:44.083 --> 50:46.417
Why does Bonnie have a pet rabbit?

50:47.167 --> 50:49.625
Maybe a present... for Bonnie's momma.

50:50.167 --> 50:52.458
Or Billie Mace.
You know, she's generous like that.

50:52.542 --> 50:54.875
Yeah, she can light up a rainy day,
can't she, Ted?

50:54.958 --> 50:56.625
Little bitty of a thing,
ain't but 90 pounds,

50:56.917 --> 51:00.542
but she could shoot a patrolman
in the face, point-blank, while he's down.

51:00.625 --> 51:03.000
-You can tell from her tracks?
-See that heel scrape?

51:04.708 --> 51:05.542
He was on his side.

51:05.625 --> 51:08.708
She used her foot to push him over
so he could see what was about to happen.

51:08.792 --> 51:11.250
Those kids you grew up with
aren't human anymore.<i></i>Look at me!

51:15.167 --> 51:16.750
Remember that at the next roadblock.

51:20.958 --> 51:21.958
You okay, son?

51:22.292 --> 51:23.292
Yeah.

51:24.208 --> 51:25.417
We'll be in touch.

52:03.417 --> 52:04.292
Red River.

52:08.750 --> 52:10.042
It's the state line.

52:15.625 --> 52:17.083
Oklahoma.

52:21.417 --> 52:23.667
-Just thought I'd point that out.
-Thank you.

52:25.167 --> 52:26.750
It's open range now.

52:29.292 --> 52:31.333
<i>Well, where the hell are they?</i>

52:32.042 --> 52:33.250
I'm not sure.

52:33.333 --> 52:34.500
Why not?

52:35.125 --> 52:36.208
They work for you.

52:36.292 --> 52:39.208
They were in Dallas three days ago.
That's as much as I know.

52:39.500 --> 52:43.250
You promised to keep Hamer
on a short leash, didn't you?

52:45.208 --> 52:48.208
If they make a fool of me,
there's going to be hell to pay.

52:49.042 --> 52:51.667
Do we understand each other,
Marshall Lee Simmons?

52:51.750 --> 52:52.833
Yes, ma'am.

52:53.500 --> 52:54.333
Good.

53:01.208 --> 53:03.625
-Never seen 'em.
-Never seen 'em?

53:13.583 --> 53:14.458
Well,

53:15.208 --> 53:17.708
there hasn't been
another filling station for...

53:18.083 --> 53:19.792
160 miles, you know.

53:23.042 --> 53:25.833
You never saw a blue sedan
with black tires?

53:25.917 --> 53:26.792
Nope.

53:26.875 --> 53:29.500
Two men and a woman,
headed northbound?

53:30.667 --> 53:34.333
If it's Bonnie and Clyde you looking for,
I didn't see 'em.

53:34.917 --> 53:37.667
And if I did, all the luck to 'em.

53:39.167 --> 53:40.833
They're only taking from the banks

53:40.917 --> 53:43.458
who are taking from the poor folk,
like me.

53:58.792 --> 53:59.625
Well?

54:11.458 --> 54:12.292
Oh, Lord.

54:13.917 --> 54:16.833
Now what? I done told you all
I'm gonna tell you about Bonnie and Clyde.

54:21.042 --> 54:22.542
There's a peace officer,

54:22.917 --> 54:24.875
he died in a puddle of himself
back in Dallas.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.917
He was trying to get the shells
out of his pockets...

54:36.833 --> 54:39.583
when his head was blown off,
Easter Sunday morning.

54:41.542 --> 54:44.083
His family will be
on the breadline next week.

54:44.542 --> 54:45.375
All luck to 'em?

54:47.625 --> 54:48.583
All luck to 'em?

54:51.000 --> 54:51.833
Pancho!

54:52.500 --> 54:54.875
-Is that really all you got to say, son?
-Pancho!

55:06.167 --> 55:07.458
They come through here yesterday.

55:08.875 --> 55:10.750
Asked me
where the nearest migrant camp was.

55:11.917 --> 55:13.542
Showed 'em on the state map.

55:17.125 --> 55:19.750
Black tires, blue sedan.

55:21.208 --> 55:22.875
The woman was carrying
a white bunny rabbit.

55:29.958 --> 55:33.042
Gas prices these days
got everybody a little riled.

56:11.625 --> 56:14.417
-What?
-Well, you're the more sociable type.

56:14.500 --> 56:16.250
Meaning I'm the more full of shit.

56:21.208 --> 56:22.458
You boys hiring?

56:22.542 --> 56:24.542
I was gonna ask you the same.

56:25.125 --> 56:26.208
My partner and I...

56:26.292 --> 56:29.750
been on the road a long while.
Business went under in Fort Worth.

56:29.833 --> 56:32.875
-Foreclosed. Damn banks.
-It says so in the Bible.

56:33.167 --> 56:34.292
The banks is the Devil.

56:35.083 --> 56:36.250
Say, my daughter

56:36.333 --> 56:40.292
and her boyfriend been moving
camp to camp, looking for work.

56:40.375 --> 56:43.375
Would've come through in a new Ford sedan.

56:43.458 --> 56:45.333
Wouldn't have happened to see them,
would you?

56:45.417 --> 56:47.917
Two boys and a red-haired girl.

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
-Tiny thing.
-They didn't come through here.

56:56.417 --> 56:58.208
Trade for some pump water?

56:58.792 --> 57:00.625
Much obliged, mister. Good luck to you.

57:05.500 --> 57:06.750
They like me.

57:15.792 --> 57:19.000
Well, those are some first-rate mud pies,
right there.

57:30.250 --> 57:32.083
I had a little girl like you.

57:32.917 --> 57:34.583
She's all grown up now.

57:35.083 --> 57:37.208
Got a baby of her own. A boy.

57:53.292 --> 57:54.167
Hey.

57:56.042 --> 57:57.458
Can I ask you something?

58:00.250 --> 58:02.292
Have you seen these two come around here,

58:02.542 --> 58:04.000
dressed up real nice?

58:06.667 --> 58:10.042
These are bad folks.
They hurt other people.

58:10.125 --> 58:12.750
And if we don't find 'em,
they're gonna hurt more people.

58:16.792 --> 58:18.208
Have you seen 'em here?

58:25.000 --> 58:25.833
Okay.

58:39.667 --> 58:40.583
Masterful.

58:41.375 --> 58:43.875
Well, why don't you get out
and beat the hell out of everybody?

58:46.917 --> 58:48.375
The lady gave it to me.

59:29.125 --> 59:30.000
Still warm?

59:34.833 --> 59:36.792
Butts over here, spread out.

59:44.792 --> 59:46.042
Hand-rolled Durham.

59:47.417 --> 59:49.167
She puffs Camels, right?

59:50.500 --> 59:51.500
Yeah.

59:52.250 --> 59:53.708
Clyde smokes Luckies.

59:55.417 --> 59:57.625
Always has that third man on watch.

59:58.917 --> 1:00:01.042
Usually near the car, away from 'em.

1:00:02.333 --> 1:00:03.583
But which one is he?

1:00:03.792 --> 1:00:05.583
Well, three broke out,

1:00:06.042 --> 1:00:08.417
only one's still with 'em.

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:11.917
Hamilton maybe, like you said.

1:00:12.292 --> 1:00:13.958
Well, maybe I was wrong.

1:00:15.667 --> 1:00:17.917
Sorry, I didn't catch that. You were what?

1:00:18.417 --> 1:00:19.417
Hamilton, he's a…

1:00:20.542 --> 1:00:25.292
He's a front-runner, a peacock.
Old Durham over there, he's a follower.

1:00:25.375 --> 1:00:27.208
You got all that from their file?

1:00:27.292 --> 1:00:30.458
You track a wolf and you track a dog,
soon you know the difference.

1:00:31.333 --> 1:00:34.167
Our third man over there,
that's Clyde's watchdog.

1:00:39.458 --> 1:00:41.500
You know, he may not drink, but...

1:00:42.833 --> 1:00:43.833
she sure does.

1:00:44.083 --> 1:00:47.958
Little girl's in serious pain. Laudanum.

1:00:54.292 --> 1:00:55.500
I love Clara Bow.

1:01:26.083 --> 1:01:27.417
Stuck, it looks like.

1:01:41.208 --> 1:01:42.833
You folks need some help?

1:02:02.542 --> 1:02:03.917
Oh, Lord, help me.

1:02:05.042 --> 1:02:05.875
Hi, sweetie.

1:02:36.792 --> 1:02:38.667
Kansas or Panhandle?

1:02:43.250 --> 1:02:44.958
Check the file. See if any...

1:02:46.042 --> 1:02:48.125
of the escapees have family nearby.

1:02:58.458 --> 1:03:00.583
You know you got a radio in this thing?

1:03:00.667 --> 1:03:01.917
That ain't factory.

1:03:02.500 --> 1:03:03.917
How much that set you back?

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.708
You'd have to ask Gladdie.

1:03:06.625 --> 1:03:08.833
It's an intrusion
on a man's peace and quiet.

1:03:08.917 --> 1:03:10.667
Not that I've had any since Lubbock.

1:03:18.083 --> 1:03:20.458
Oh yeah, that's a good one.

1:03:28.750 --> 1:03:30.542
<i>This is an emergency alert.</i>

1:03:30.625 --> 1:03:33.250
<i>Police are not releasing details,</i>
<i>but it has been reported</i>

1:03:33.333 --> 1:03:36.292
<i>that two officers have been shot</i>
<i>on a country road in a rural area</i>

1:03:36.375 --> 1:03:37.875
<i>just north of Commerce, Oklahoma.</i>

1:03:37.958 --> 1:03:39.083
How far is that?

1:03:43.375 --> 1:03:44.417
Twenty miles.

1:04:03.333 --> 1:04:04.875
This don't look promising.

1:04:09.333 --> 1:04:10.167
How are we today?

1:04:10.250 --> 1:04:13.167
Well, it's never good when
a peace officer goes down in the line.

1:04:15.333 --> 1:04:18.458
We need to get through, sir. Now.

1:04:18.542 --> 1:04:20.458
Only the Bureau has
multi-state jurisdiction.

1:04:20.542 --> 1:04:22.000
We need to stay the trail.

1:04:22.083 --> 1:04:24.083
This paper is worthless up here.

1:04:24.250 --> 1:04:26.250
So, unless you're government agents

1:04:26.333 --> 1:04:28.958
or Oklahoma police officers,
you're not passing this roadblock.

1:04:30.125 --> 1:04:31.667
Turn this vehicle around.

1:04:52.667 --> 1:04:53.500
Goddammit.

1:04:58.583 --> 1:05:00.625
Hey!
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1:05:00.708 --> 1:05:02.000
Hey! Come back here!

1:05:03.208 --> 1:05:04.917
They need dope for the girl.

1:05:06.417 --> 1:05:08.208
What's the closest large town?

1:05:08.542 --> 1:05:11.125
You know what, Pancho?
Maybe I should drive.

1:05:13.417 --> 1:05:14.542
What town?

1:05:29.250 --> 1:05:30.417
What's that?

1:05:31.375 --> 1:05:32.833
Expense report.

1:05:35.542 --> 1:05:36.750
It's how much we...

1:05:38.917 --> 1:05:40.375
It's how much we cost.

1:05:42.583 --> 1:05:44.542
How many bullets you got in you?

1:05:44.833 --> 1:05:46.250
Hell, I don't know.

1:05:48.917 --> 1:05:50.125
Sixteen, I think.

1:05:50.708 --> 1:05:52.375
You know, a man can't...

1:05:53.167 --> 1:05:56.625
pass bullets through him
like he can kidney stones.

1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:57.958
You...

1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:02.625
It might be good to have a doctor
look at you sometime.

1:06:02.708 --> 1:06:04.833
It might be good to have a doctor
look at you sometime.

1:06:05.208 --> 1:06:06.833
I ain't got no bullets in me.

1:06:07.167 --> 1:06:08.917
Because I was covering you.

1:06:15.125 --> 1:06:19.167
Clyde's ahead of us on the road.
How long we gonna just sit here?

1:06:19.250 --> 1:06:21.083
I don't know. You got a better idea?

1:06:22.333 --> 1:06:23.708
I don't know if it's better.

1:06:24.625 --> 1:06:27.250
The file said there was one convict

1:06:27.333 --> 1:06:30.833
tried to make that Eastham escape,
but missed the bus.

1:06:31.083 --> 1:06:32.167
Wade McNabb.

1:06:33.250 --> 1:06:34.708
-Why?
-Well...

1:06:34.792 --> 1:06:37.958
if you were a free man, wouldn't you try
to meet up with your friends?

1:06:38.542 --> 1:06:41.125
McNabb's only in for firearms.

1:06:41.208 --> 1:06:44.042
He's not a killer.
Lee Simmons could get him furloughed.

1:06:44.125 --> 1:06:46.542
Lady Governor would have to sign for it.

1:06:46.958 --> 1:06:51.000
I'd wager she's not too happy
about us expanding our jurisdiction.

1:06:51.083 --> 1:06:52.083
I'm just saying.

1:06:53.333 --> 1:06:54.333
Maney.

1:06:58.833 --> 1:06:59.875
Bonnie Parker.

1:07:02.542 --> 1:07:04.292
I've seen ten of 'em today.

1:07:05.958 --> 1:07:07.958
Yeah, it's the...

1:07:08.542 --> 1:07:10.792
-It's the fashion.
-All the rage.

1:07:18.042 --> 1:07:20.875
-Where you going?
-Nature calls.

1:07:21.583 --> 1:07:23.083
Jiminy Christmas. You just went!

1:08:51.458 --> 1:08:52.625
Hello, Bonnie!

1:09:06.750 --> 1:09:09.125
-Get in the picture, now!
-Bonnie and Clyde!

1:09:16.750 --> 1:09:17.917
It's Bonnie and Clyde!

1:09:21.125 --> 1:09:23.083
It's them, around the corner!

1:09:23.167 --> 1:09:24.625
Grab a shotgun.

1:09:30.792 --> 1:09:33.167
I'm gonna back us out of here. Come on.

1:09:40.042 --> 1:09:41.167
Son of a...

1:09:43.750 --> 1:09:46.167
They parked in the back.
One of 'em went in.

1:09:46.708 --> 1:09:49.042
Wasn't Ray Hamilton, neither.
It was Henry Methvin,

1:09:49.125 --> 1:09:52.333
-the third man in the jailbreak.
-I know, I saw him. You let him go?

1:09:53.917 --> 1:09:55.667
Well, I had my eye on Clyde.

1:09:55.750 --> 1:09:58.667
Clyde? You had your--
You had your eye on Clyde?

1:09:59.583 --> 1:10:00.833
You had a shot?

1:10:02.583 --> 1:10:04.125
Why didn't you take him?

1:10:04.958 --> 1:10:07.917
Too many people. Goddamn fan club.

1:10:12.458 --> 1:10:13.958
Bonnie, we love you!

1:10:14.833 --> 1:10:16.000
We love you!

1:11:12.333 --> 1:11:13.708
Damn.

1:11:44.250 --> 1:11:46.083
Right there!

1:11:49.750 --> 1:11:50.958
I can't see 'em!

1:11:57.708 --> 1:11:58.667
Frank!

1:12:43.750 --> 1:12:44.625
Yeah.

1:13:17.250 --> 1:13:19.792
They stopped
for a nice breakfast this morning.

1:13:20.833 --> 1:13:23.042
French toast and coffee.

1:13:23.625 --> 1:13:27.500
Clyde ordered himself a soft-boiled egg
off the à la carte menu.

1:13:28.833 --> 1:13:30.917
Cute little diner in Amarillo.

1:13:31.500 --> 1:13:33.542
-Amarillo?
-Yeah.

1:13:35.833 --> 1:13:37.958
Clyde drove 400 miles last night?

1:13:38.042 --> 1:13:39.708
Four hundred and fifty.

1:13:43.167 --> 1:13:44.875
Do you ever think, maybe...

1:13:46.458 --> 1:13:48.500
Maybe it ain't in us no more?

1:14:31.250 --> 1:14:36.083
He got through a thousand-man dragnet
to deliver a bunny to Momma.

1:14:41.083 --> 1:14:42.292
What do we do now?

1:14:42.750 --> 1:14:44.667
I just had the one idea.

1:14:52.500 --> 1:14:53.333
Pancho!

1:15:51.333 --> 1:15:52.667
Thank you, sir.

1:15:58.792 --> 1:16:01.500
They tell me
you're from the highway department, but...

1:16:03.208 --> 1:16:04.833
I know who you really are.

1:16:08.667 --> 1:16:10.125
I know a killer when I see one.

1:16:10.208 --> 1:16:12.208
I'm sure you would, Mr. Barrow.

1:16:15.708 --> 1:16:17.583
Look, mister.

1:16:18.750 --> 1:16:19.583
I'm...

1:16:21.500 --> 1:16:24.125
I know y'all are gonna have to kill
my boy.

1:16:25.583 --> 1:16:26.792
It ain't your fault.

1:16:27.083 --> 1:16:29.917
He's gone past the point of redemption.

1:16:31.833 --> 1:16:33.125
There's something I wanna say.

1:16:36.542 --> 1:16:37.417
Here.

1:16:39.500 --> 1:16:41.042
He wasn't born that way.

1:16:42.708 --> 1:16:45.375
He wasn't born with no dark soul.

1:16:47.792 --> 1:16:49.000
My little Huck Finn.

1:16:50.375 --> 1:16:52.625
That's what me and Cumie called him.

1:16:53.167 --> 1:16:55.167
He loved bicycles.

1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:59.333
What he really wanted to be
was a musician.

1:17:00.333 --> 1:17:03.125
I mean, sure, he liked to dress fine
and get the girls

1:17:03.208 --> 1:17:05.000
and all like that, but it...

1:17:05.583 --> 1:17:07.417
You know, he wasn't a bad boy.

1:17:07.958 --> 1:17:09.417
I had high hopes.

1:17:10.917 --> 1:17:15.250
People don't always know who they are...
until it's too late.

1:17:15.333 --> 1:17:18.375
Oh, you mean one turn on the trail, huh?

1:17:18.708 --> 1:17:19.833
That what you mean?

1:17:20.833 --> 1:17:22.292
He stole a chicken.

1:17:23.542 --> 1:17:25.958
He stole a goddamn chicken, mister,

1:17:26.042 --> 1:17:30.208
and the law took him for a bad seed.
And from that day forward,

1:17:30.792 --> 1:17:32.500
he was dogged by the law.

1:17:32.583 --> 1:17:34.417
-Dogged him?
-Yes, sir!

1:17:36.333 --> 1:17:37.375
Dogged or watched him?

1:17:37.458 --> 1:17:40.000
I guess it's all the same to you.
You're a cop.

1:17:40.458 --> 1:17:41.458
Yes, I am.

1:17:51.833 --> 1:17:53.333
Growing up all I ever…

1:17:54.708 --> 1:17:57.958
-All I ever wanted to be was a preacher.
-Preacher?

1:17:59.875 --> 1:18:01.500
You expect me to believe that?

1:18:03.583 --> 1:18:05.542
I was saving up for the seminary.

1:18:06.750 --> 1:18:09.167
Working for a sharecropper in San Saba.

1:18:10.750 --> 1:18:13.500
Word got out
that I was pretty handy with a pistol.

1:18:14.333 --> 1:18:18.250
The owner, McSwain, called me up
to the porch one day and wanted to know

1:18:18.333 --> 1:18:21.042
if I wanted to make $150.

1:18:22.125 --> 1:18:25.292
I laughed and said,
“Who do I have to kill?”

1:18:28.125 --> 1:18:29.625
And he kept staring at me.

1:18:30.750 --> 1:18:32.000
That's when I knew...

1:18:33.250 --> 1:18:37.042
he wasn't talking
about killing a coyote or a polecat.

1:18:39.833 --> 1:18:42.750
He was talking about his business partner
he wanted dead.

1:18:45.333 --> 1:18:46.667
I told him I was gonna...

1:18:47.333 --> 1:18:48.667
tell his business partner.

1:18:49.750 --> 1:18:50.875
That wasn't too smart.

1:18:50.958 --> 1:18:52.292
Well, I was 16!

1:18:53.833 --> 1:18:57.500
Like I said, I was saving up
for the seminary.

1:18:59.458 --> 1:19:01.000
Couple weeks later, he...

1:19:01.542 --> 1:19:04.125
asked me to put some groceries
in his house.

1:19:05.042 --> 1:19:08.250
Before I could go in,
he pulled a scattergun.

1:19:09.792 --> 1:19:11.458
Shot me in my head...

1:19:12.458 --> 1:19:13.542
my back...

1:19:14.750 --> 1:19:15.583
and my leg.

1:19:17.542 --> 1:19:21.500
For whatever reasons I still don't know,
he stepped right over me and went inside.

1:19:22.125 --> 1:19:24.667
Maybe to reload. I don't know, but I...

1:19:25.500 --> 1:19:29.375
I scrambled away.
Hid in an irrigation ditch.

1:19:29.750 --> 1:19:32.625
I would've died there,
except for a colored field hand...

1:19:33.250 --> 1:19:34.667
came along, found me,

1:19:35.542 --> 1:19:40.625
carried me home.
My momma took care of me all summer.

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:43.125
Come fall, I...

1:19:43.833 --> 1:19:45.833
I packed up for the seminary.

1:19:47.667 --> 1:19:49.500
At least, that's what I told 'em.

1:19:50.833 --> 1:19:54.125
And on my way out of town,
I rode over to McSwain's.

1:19:54.917 --> 1:19:57.083
Rang the yard bell. He came out.

1:19:57.833 --> 1:20:01.500
And I shot that son of a bitch dead,
right there on that same porch.

1:20:02.917 --> 1:20:04.542
And there went my calling.

1:20:08.458 --> 1:20:11.042
Turned out,
McSwain was a wanted man himself...

1:20:12.333 --> 1:20:13.833
and I became the law.

1:20:14.833 --> 1:20:16.333
One turn on the trail, huh?

1:20:16.417 --> 1:20:17.333
Yes, sir.

1:20:17.875 --> 1:20:18.875
One turn.

1:20:20.375 --> 1:20:22.208
How come you're telling me all this?

1:20:25.292 --> 1:20:28.208
You ever think maybe there was something
in Clyde...

1:20:28.917 --> 1:20:31.792
that made him steal that chicken
in the first place?

1:20:33.958 --> 1:20:35.375
Maybe he was hungry.

1:20:38.417 --> 1:20:40.208
Maybe we were all hungry.

1:20:45.083 --> 1:20:46.083
I won't argue that.

1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:49.417
He ain't gonna surrender.

1:20:51.833 --> 1:20:53.792
You're just gonna hang him anyhow.

1:20:55.292 --> 1:20:57.958
He'd rather be brought down on the run.

1:21:00.292 --> 1:21:06.542
You know, your boy may not have been...
born with a dark soul, but he has one now.

1:21:06.750 --> 1:21:08.500
You're not hearing me, mister.

1:21:09.958 --> 1:21:11.708
I'm trying to say something.

1:21:12.250 --> 1:21:13.958
It ain't easy for me to say.

1:21:15.708 --> 1:21:19.542
I know there's only one way
that this thing is ever gonna end.

1:21:20.833 --> 1:21:22.625
And I'm asking you, please...

1:21:25.083 --> 1:21:26.917
just end it now, damn it.

1:21:28.333 --> 1:21:29.708
End it for my family.

1:21:47.750 --> 1:21:52.000
You call Lee Simmons.
Get him to furlough Wade McNabb.

1:21:53.917 --> 1:21:55.417
What a fine idea.

1:22:14.583 --> 1:22:17.292
-You remember, right?
-That's what I'm talking about.

1:22:26.125 --> 1:22:29.792
I couldn't believe it when Billy Mays
said he was letting you out.

1:22:30.250 --> 1:22:33.833
Sixty days. And if I get a job
and I do good behavior in that time,

1:22:33.917 --> 1:22:35.417
it could be full parole.

1:22:35.833 --> 1:22:37.958
But it ain't good behavior
I got on my mind tonight.

1:22:39.417 --> 1:22:40.750
My kind of place.

1:22:46.417 --> 1:22:47.833
How are you, darling?

1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.208
So, is it true?
Do you really know Clyde Barrow?

1:22:54.292 --> 1:22:56.500
I knew his brother Buck, too,
before they shot him dead.

1:22:56.583 --> 1:22:57.750
What are we gonna do with you?

1:22:57.833 --> 1:23:00.167
-I can think of a few things, darling.
-Oh yeah?

1:23:03.250 --> 1:23:05.000
Good to be off the farm, Wade?

1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:17.542
-They wouldn't tell me your name.
-Don't need it.

1:23:18.250 --> 1:23:19.083
I dig.

1:23:22.125 --> 1:23:24.833
Say you order me a do-over, slick.

1:23:27.167 --> 1:23:28.000
Or not.

1:23:29.583 --> 1:23:31.208
Where's the water closet?

1:23:44.958 --> 1:23:46.375
So what do y'all need me to do?

1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.333
Say,
you bringing the cattle to market, Dad?

1:24:16.083 --> 1:24:17.292
I swear, big man.

1:24:17.375 --> 1:24:22.417
They're planning to skin out for Mexico.
That is the word. What do you know, Joe?

1:24:24.417 --> 1:24:27.750
Son, suppose you cut
the junior gangster act and get serious.

1:24:27.833 --> 1:24:29.667
Otherwise,
there's nothing you can do for me.

1:24:29.750 --> 1:24:32.750
I'll have Lee Simmons give you a ride
back to the farm tonight.

1:24:33.208 --> 1:24:34.083
Yes, sir.

1:24:34.542 --> 1:24:36.667
Let me tell you something, mister.

1:24:38.042 --> 1:24:40.667
You come to the wrong place
to dog Wade-Boy.

1:24:40.750 --> 1:24:41.750
That's right, old man.

1:24:42.083 --> 1:24:45.167
You see, Wade-Boy runs with Clyde.

1:24:46.417 --> 1:24:49.042
And around here, Clyde is king.

1:24:50.625 --> 1:24:52.375
Watch those fancy shoes.

1:24:58.917 --> 1:25:02.333
It's a real mess, you get it point-blank,
but I'm happy to do it for you.

1:25:02.417 --> 1:25:04.542
A lot of nerve you got, trying to...

1:25:05.250 --> 1:25:07.958
rob a fella while he's having himself
a pleasant relief.

1:25:08.458 --> 1:25:09.625
Get in that stall.

1:25:13.542 --> 1:25:17.083
Stay in there till I come back
and tell you different.

1:25:21.167 --> 1:25:24.792
Clyde might be king,
but I'm a Texas Ranger, you little shit.

1:25:28.167 --> 1:25:30.083
Billie Mace is set to fix Bonnie's hair.

1:25:30.333 --> 1:25:33.042
-When?
-Tomorrow. Dinnertime.

1:25:33.583 --> 1:25:36.083
Might look like two girls.
Sometimes Clyde wears a wig.

1:25:38.667 --> 1:25:42.333
-He got y'all chasing your own tails.
-Son, if you're telling the truth...

1:25:43.167 --> 1:25:46.292
you'll finish out your term
in a nice, civilized federal pen.

1:25:48.333 --> 1:25:49.375
But you do wrong by me,

1:25:49.458 --> 1:25:51.792
you'll be back on the farm,
breaking rocks...

1:25:52.125 --> 1:25:54.000
and getting your teeth stove-in.

1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:56.125
What took you so long?

1:25:57.458 --> 1:25:58.917
There's a fella in the toilet.

1:26:16.750 --> 1:26:18.042
Are you Billie Mace?

1:26:23.833 --> 1:26:25.292
You must be Billy Mace.

1:26:57.042 --> 1:26:58.167
Hey, Granddad.

1:26:59.375 --> 1:27:00.708
Wanna race again?

1:27:13.667 --> 1:27:15.792
Didn't your momma teach you
to tie your shoes?

1:27:31.750 --> 1:27:34.042
-We gonna see each other again?
-No, sir.

1:27:38.417 --> 1:27:39.583
Git!

1:27:42.792 --> 1:27:44.750
"Git." Downright poetic.

1:27:49.458 --> 1:27:51.792
"Headed for greener pastures.

1:27:51.917 --> 1:27:53.583
See you next time around."

1:27:59.958 --> 1:28:01.083
McNabb warned 'em.

1:28:38.833 --> 1:28:41.000
McNabb! Open up the goddamn door!

1:29:26.542 --> 1:29:28.000
Goddamn animals.

1:29:57.125 --> 1:29:58.667
Did I get that boy killed?

1:29:59.542 --> 1:30:00.375
No, sir.

1:30:01.417 --> 1:30:02.292
You did not.

1:30:05.833 --> 1:30:08.875
He would have been out
in nine months on his own.

1:30:11.750 --> 1:30:12.708
Fella did not...

1:30:13.917 --> 1:30:14.750
have to die.

1:30:16.042 --> 1:30:18.292
Maybe so,
but that fella made his own choices.

1:30:22.542 --> 1:30:23.458
See, Frank...

1:30:24.833 --> 1:30:28.042
that's the difference
right there between you and me.

1:30:29.917 --> 1:30:32.250
You could always hide...

1:30:32.958 --> 1:30:35.958
behind some notion
of right and wrong.

1:30:36.042 --> 1:30:40.208
Me,
I never particularly liked the weight...

1:30:40.958 --> 1:30:45.292
of the deciding
who gets to live and who doesn't.

1:30:46.333 --> 1:30:48.458
There's differences between us, Maney,

1:30:49.833 --> 1:30:52.167
but hiding
behind something ain't one of 'em.

1:30:54.417 --> 1:30:57.542
You know, counting McNabb,
they've killed 13.

1:30:58.167 --> 1:30:59.708
And people call 'em heroes.

1:31:00.917 --> 1:31:03.167
-Who cares what they call--
-I care!

1:31:04.375 --> 1:31:05.875
People idolize them.

1:31:07.125 --> 1:31:08.542
We need to end this.

1:31:11.125 --> 1:31:12.167
It's never easy,

1:31:13.083 --> 1:31:14.375
it's never pretty,

1:31:15.750 --> 1:31:19.250
but there's always blood
at the end of the road, you know that.

1:31:19.583 --> 1:31:21.083
You know that the same as me.

1:31:25.042 --> 1:31:28.875
I seen a lot a blood...
but it ain't theirs.

1:31:28.958 --> 1:31:31.125
Goddamnit, Maney, why the hell…

1:31:32.708 --> 1:31:34.417
Why the hell you even come?

1:32:17.917 --> 1:32:19.125
I had to come.

1:32:22.917 --> 1:32:25.792
Though I don't exactly know why.

1:32:32.208 --> 1:32:34.917
It's gonna look like we set McNabb up
to be killed.

1:32:37.958 --> 1:32:39.083
If Ma finds out...

1:32:42.125 --> 1:32:44.667
I don't think I can protect you or myself.

1:32:46.167 --> 1:32:49.042
<i>You need to come back to Austin</i>
<i>so we can sort this out.</i>

1:32:49.167 --> 1:32:50.458
I understand, Lee.

1:33:20.625 --> 1:33:22.917
If you're ready to go home,
I'll drive you.

1:33:24.167 --> 1:33:26.042
Take me to greener pastures.

1:33:27.750 --> 1:33:32.208
I'll just get a bottle and sit there
and wait for Clyde to show up.

1:33:34.667 --> 1:33:38.958
Does that mean anything, you think?
"Headed for greener pastures."

1:33:40.208 --> 1:33:42.292
Is he headed for a state
he hasn't hit yet?

1:33:42.375 --> 1:33:43.208
Could be.

1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:46.667
What states have warrants for him?

1:33:48.042 --> 1:33:51.458
No, better still, what states don't?

1:33:53.333 --> 1:33:54.958
New Mexico...

1:33:56.500 --> 1:33:57.625
Colorado,

1:33:58.375 --> 1:33:59.458
Louisiana.

1:34:00.292 --> 1:34:02.000
Outlaws always go home.

1:34:03.625 --> 1:34:06.250
Maybe we just been looking
at the wrong home.

1:34:08.833 --> 1:34:10.250
Methvin, where's he from?

1:34:12.083 --> 1:34:14.208
-Kansas.
-He still have family there?

1:34:15.625 --> 1:34:17.375
No, his dad...

1:34:18.625 --> 1:34:20.750
lives in Bienville Parish.

1:34:20.833 --> 1:34:22.417
East of Shreveport.

1:34:46.083 --> 1:34:49.667
Owner lets folk squat
in exchange for labor.

1:34:50.458 --> 1:34:52.333
Henry's daddy hauls wood for 'em.

1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:58.167
That's his truck.

1:35:01.792 --> 1:35:02.958
Let's go!

1:35:03.042 --> 1:35:04.167
Ivy Methvin.

1:39:17.333 --> 1:39:18.500
They're playing house.

1:39:19.083 --> 1:39:20.500
She's a little bitty thing.

1:39:28.042 --> 1:39:29.167
So's he.

1:40:03.750 --> 1:40:04.625
You all right?

1:40:06.792 --> 1:40:07.625
Yeah.

1:40:09.250 --> 1:40:10.583
Fix the room back.

1:40:32.958 --> 1:40:34.375
Probably best they weren't home.

1:40:34.458 --> 1:40:37.042
We got no jurisdiction to arrest
in these parts.

1:40:37.125 --> 1:40:39.333
Now, we weren't there to arrest them,
Maney.

1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:43.708
Well, then I suggest we bring in
a local sheriff next time.

1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000
Okay, what if he's in on the hand?

1:40:47.500 --> 1:40:50.458
A corrupt sheriff down this way
isn't exactly remarkable.

1:40:50.542 --> 1:40:52.083
One way to find out.

1:40:56.625 --> 1:40:57.833
You said you seen Clyde.

1:40:58.250 --> 1:40:59.083
Yes, sir.

1:40:59.167 --> 1:41:01.167
Where? North Highway?

1:41:01.250 --> 1:41:03.917
-Most recently, two miles from-<i>-</i>
-How do you know it him?

1:41:06.125 --> 1:41:07.083
My name is...

1:41:07.500 --> 1:41:08.708
Flavius Kern.

1:41:08.792 --> 1:41:12.250
I am the Barrow family parson. May I?

1:41:12.708 --> 1:41:13.750
Thank you.

1:41:14.375 --> 1:41:18.292
Now, nobody knows I'm here,
and you never saw me.

1:41:19.292 --> 1:41:24.000
But, the family is grateful to you

1:41:24.125 --> 1:41:29.250
because the kids,
they're good kids. They're...

1:41:29.917 --> 1:41:32.083
They got in a little over their heads,

1:41:32.167 --> 1:41:35.208
but word is there's some heat on 'em
down here.

1:41:35.292 --> 1:41:38.708
And I know you never saw 'em,
and you never heard they was

1:41:38.792 --> 1:41:41.375
in your parish,
and we'd like to keep it that way.

1:41:41.458 --> 1:41:46.542
Clyde will try to show his appreciation
to you, but the family...

1:41:49.250 --> 1:41:50.958
would like to show theirs.

1:41:56.750 --> 1:42:00.417
Call it a contribution
to the parish church.

1:42:01.250 --> 1:42:03.458
Now,
I won't take up any more of your time.

1:42:10.292 --> 1:42:13.167
Your boy use a shotgun on that gator or...

1:42:13.250 --> 1:42:15.792
No, we used a gig, like this here.

1:42:15.875 --> 1:42:19.542
Listen to me, <i>papere.</i> I see the dogs
in Bienville, I'll shoot 'em dead.

1:42:20.542 --> 1:42:24.083
Take your bribe and go home,
or I'll shoot your ass, too.

1:42:24.583 --> 1:42:25.667
We're not crooks here.

1:42:25.750 --> 1:42:28.458
Well, then, you are just the gentlemen
we're looking for.

1:42:29.958 --> 1:42:30.958
<i>Timber!</i>

1:42:35.708 --> 1:42:36.542
Mr. Ivy.

1:42:37.125 --> 1:42:41.125
Some men over there looking for somebody
to cut and haul wood.

1:42:43.208 --> 1:42:44.292
Say they pay fair.

1:42:45.042 --> 1:42:48.625
You need some more hands,
me and my boy, we needs the work.

1:42:50.375 --> 1:42:51.250
Work right here.

1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:52.833
Get to it.

1:42:54.083 --> 1:42:55.083
Yes, sir.

1:43:22.833 --> 1:43:25.708
-What the hell is this?
-I'm Sheriff Jordan.

1:43:25.833 --> 1:43:28.458
-This is my deputy, Mr. Oakley.
<i>-</i>Well, who are you fellas?

1:43:28.542 --> 1:43:29.750
Doesn't concern you.

1:43:31.417 --> 1:43:35.083
All you need to know is Bonnie and Clyde
are going down hard, Mr. Methvin.

1:43:35.833 --> 1:43:38.125
If not by the gun, then by the chair.

1:43:39.333 --> 1:43:42.083
-And your boy Henry is going with them.
-My boy didn't kill nobody.

1:43:42.167 --> 1:43:45.917
Killed a highway patrolman
near Grapevine, Texas.

1:43:46.042 --> 1:43:47.375
We have a witness,

1:43:47.458 --> 1:43:49.500
ballistics, and the whole book.

1:43:50.625 --> 1:43:52.208
Wiretaps.

1:43:52.292 --> 1:43:54.625
We know
they're gonna be coming to see you.

1:43:54.708 --> 1:43:56.458
We're gonna give your son
a chance to live.

1:43:56.833 --> 1:43:57.750
How?

1:43:58.625 --> 1:44:00.750
Well, he's gonna have to put 'em
on the spot.

1:44:01.417 --> 1:44:03.958
He does, we'll put him on the ground,
instead of in it.

1:44:04.333 --> 1:44:08.250
-Meaning you'll let him go?
-As far as Texas is concerned, yes, sir.

1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:18.875
They might be by in a day or two.

1:44:23.875 --> 1:44:27.708
When you get your boy alone, you tell him
to get separated first chance he gets.

1:44:28.250 --> 1:44:31.417
-They'll come right back to see him.
-We'll be waiting.

1:44:31.500 --> 1:44:34.125
-Why should I trust you?
-Because I said.

1:44:39.708 --> 1:44:41.708
That's just how he's built.

1:44:43.083 --> 1:44:44.583
Well, they got a rule.

1:44:45.167 --> 1:44:47.833
If they get separated,
they wait a couple days

1:44:47.917 --> 1:44:50.958
for the air to clear
and then meet up back at my house.

1:44:52.875 --> 1:44:54.167
Clyde won't be taken alive.

1:44:54.500 --> 1:44:59.500
Neither will your boy, sir,
unless he takes his one chance now.

1:45:00.375 --> 1:45:01.375
I like my house.

1:45:01.583 --> 1:45:04.000
-Excuse me?
-I like my house!

1:45:04.875 --> 1:45:07.833
Clyde bought it for me,
and I don't want y'all shooting it up.

1:45:07.917 --> 1:45:11.083
They'll be around for Henry.
There ain't but one way in, one way out.

1:45:11.167 --> 1:45:12.125
That's Ringgold Road.

1:45:13.042 --> 1:45:14.125
Ringgold Road.

1:45:16.333 --> 1:45:18.167
Once my boy gets clear, you...

1:45:19.292 --> 1:45:20.708
Well, you can kill 'em there.

1:45:22.875 --> 1:45:23.708
All right.

1:46:20.125 --> 1:46:21.083
Take two.

1:46:25.750 --> 1:46:27.000
-Two.
-There you go.

1:46:29.458 --> 1:46:32.125
Looks like we're outnumbered
by Texans, Henderson.

1:46:32.208 --> 1:46:34.417
Well, we need these Dallas boys,
the only ones

1:46:34.500 --> 1:46:36.708
who can make a positive identification.

1:46:39.333 --> 1:46:41.708
Old Ivy said that car's loaded
with firepower.

1:46:41.792 --> 1:46:45.083
They got machine guns, hand grenades,
a thousand rounds of shells.

1:46:45.167 --> 1:46:46.750
It's an armory on four wheels.

1:46:46.833 --> 1:46:49.000
-Well, we'll find out.
-Gonna have us a hunt.

1:46:49.208 --> 1:46:50.625
Gonna skin us some deer.

1:46:51.417 --> 1:46:53.833
Dang,
if I don't have an Arkansas Straight.

1:46:57.542 --> 1:47:00.750
Dallas paper gave me a camera
to film it when it happens.

1:47:01.625 --> 1:47:03.958
Said he'd pay me. Can y'all believe that?

1:47:05.083 --> 1:47:06.958
What the hell is this world coming to?

1:47:07.292 --> 1:47:10.125
-Well, there we go.
-Three sevens?

1:47:12.542 --> 1:47:15.708
Maybe we should put six bills in the pot,
<i>homme. </i>Make it interesting.

1:47:15.792 --> 1:47:21.042
No. Cap says no money in the game,
nor drinking on Sundays.

1:47:21.125 --> 1:47:22.083
Can't be much fun.

1:47:22.167 --> 1:47:25.625
Yeah, well, there's a place
for me in heaven, I'll tell you that.

1:47:28.125 --> 1:47:29.583
What's he doing out there?

1:47:29.667 --> 1:47:31.583
He likes to be alone sometimes.

1:47:38.125 --> 1:47:42.542
Sheriff Smoot said you and Hamer killed
more than 50 men between you.

1:47:48.542 --> 1:47:50.458
Killed more than that in one evening.

1:47:52.083 --> 1:47:53.458
I didn't mean to pry.

1:47:54.750 --> 1:47:57.375
It's all right, kid. Ante up, gents.

1:48:15.667 --> 1:48:18.333
I was young. Younger than you.

1:48:20.125 --> 1:48:22.792
South Texas, a place called Candelario.

1:48:25.167 --> 1:48:29.833
Ranger Company C. Had about 60 bandits
pinned down in a dry wash.

1:48:29.958 --> 1:48:32.958
These fellas burned half a dozen ranches,

1:48:33.042 --> 1:48:34.333
killed a dozen...

1:48:34.917 --> 1:48:36.917
and raped just about as many.

1:48:39.125 --> 1:48:41.750
Anyway, every time we'd ride in there

1:48:41.833 --> 1:48:45.125
to take 'em,
we'd yell out, <i>"Manos arribas."</i>

1:48:45.208 --> 1:48:47.042
You know, "Hands up."

1:48:48.833 --> 1:48:50.000
Well, they'd...

1:48:50.833 --> 1:48:54.958
fire on us, and we'd lose a man.
Went on like that for two days.

1:48:55.833 --> 1:48:59.167
So they sent down... young Captain Hamer,

1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:01.458
my friend Pancho.

1:49:03.083 --> 1:49:06.833
Cap says... "What's going on down here?"

1:49:07.625 --> 1:49:12.333
"Any time we yell out, <i>'manos arribas,'</i>
like the law tells us to...

1:49:13.917 --> 1:49:15.292
they open up on us."

1:49:16.083 --> 1:49:18.833
Cap says, “We're going in there
afore dawn and, this time,

1:49:18.917 --> 1:49:24.208
don't no-damn-body yell out
<i>'manos arribas.' </i>Just shoot 'em."

1:49:31.042 --> 1:49:32.542
Well, that night...

1:49:33.792 --> 1:49:36.125
them bandits were celebrating, drunk.

1:49:37.417 --> 1:49:40.208
Most of 'em asleep by the fire.
And we went in.

1:49:42.333 --> 1:49:44.500
Some of the boys refused to go.

1:49:44.667 --> 1:49:47.792
Refused to just start shooting men.

1:49:50.542 --> 1:49:54.167
But I went with Frank.
Like I said, he's my friend.

1:49:56.958 --> 1:49:58.208
He gave me the nod.

1:49:59.583 --> 1:50:00.875
We let 'em have it.

1:50:00.958 --> 1:50:05.542
We shot that arroyo all to hell
before most of them fellas even woke up.

1:50:10.417 --> 1:50:13.167
I was... jittery.

1:50:17.208 --> 1:50:20.958
A mule came out
from behind a cactus, and I...

1:50:22.333 --> 1:50:25.500
shot the man riding it half a dozen times.

1:50:28.750 --> 1:50:30.083
Turned out to be a...

1:50:31.542 --> 1:50:33.208
13-year-old boy just...

1:50:34.792 --> 1:50:36.208
trying to run away.

1:50:40.542 --> 1:50:42.125
I still see his face.

1:50:48.250 --> 1:50:52.167
Whole thing was over in five minutes.
Counted 54 dead.

1:50:53.417 --> 1:50:58.167
Counting was over, Cap sat on a rock,
holstered his gun, and said...

1:50:59.292 --> 1:51:01.833
<i>"Manos arribas, </i>you sons of bitches."

1:51:08.750 --> 1:51:09.625
Came back,

1:51:11.125 --> 1:51:13.125
governor gave us all medals.

1:51:32.958 --> 1:51:34.208
My boy got loose.

1:52:05.583 --> 1:52:07.167
When he comes, he gonna be coming

1:52:07.250 --> 1:52:09.667
from the south,
which will bring him by you.

1:52:10.917 --> 1:52:14.292
-I figure you fellas got it from here.
-Ivy...

1:52:14.958 --> 1:52:17.375
Turn your truck around,
park it the wrong side.

1:52:17.458 --> 1:52:18.333
What?

1:52:19.625 --> 1:52:22.583
-You're staying with us.
-That wasn't part of the deal.

1:52:22.667 --> 1:52:25.625
The deal ain't done till it's done.
Now, park it.

1:52:25.917 --> 1:52:28.583
Jack up the front right bumper
and take off your tire.

1:52:32.667 --> 1:52:34.542
Clyde'll slow down and help him change it.

1:52:35.125 --> 1:52:37.125
-What?
-Stash these cars.

1:52:38.417 --> 1:52:40.750
How do I know I ain't gonna get shot?

1:53:28.875 --> 1:53:29.708
You okay?

1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:31.042
Yeah. Yes, sir.

1:53:32.833 --> 1:53:35.333
We need you to identify these two.

1:53:35.708 --> 1:53:39.167
Nobody said nothing
about having to pull the trigger,

1:53:40.167 --> 1:53:41.792
which means you don't have to.

1:53:41.875 --> 1:53:44.042
-I'll be all right.
-You sure?

1:53:45.750 --> 1:53:46.583
Yeah.

1:54:10.833 --> 1:54:14.542
When they get here,
y'all stay behind the blind.

1:54:16.042 --> 1:54:19.375
I'll present myself.
You fire on my command.

1:54:21.375 --> 1:54:22.875
We stay in the blind?

1:54:23.208 --> 1:54:24.083
Yeah.

1:54:27.125 --> 1:54:28.167
You walk out there?

1:54:30.417 --> 1:54:31.583
That's an order, Gault.

1:55:06.958 --> 1:55:07.792
Maney,

1:55:09.417 --> 1:55:13.917
for the record,
you only move like you're 75.

1:55:28.042 --> 1:55:30.792
The reason I passed your house
that day was 'cause I...

1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.042
I wanted to spare you this.

1:55:39.542 --> 1:55:40.667
That said, I'm...

1:55:42.833 --> 1:55:44.208
real glad you're here.

1:55:48.250 --> 1:55:49.292
Me, too, Pancho.

1:55:51.208 --> 1:55:52.167
Me, too.

1:56:10.708 --> 1:56:13.500
Ivy! Get out there!

1:56:17.250 --> 1:56:18.083
Hurry up.

1:56:21.167 --> 1:56:22.000
It's them.

1:56:24.833 --> 1:56:25.667
Ford V-8.

1:56:31.792 --> 1:56:32.625
Ted?

1:56:33.208 --> 1:56:34.500
-Yeah.
-You better look.

1:56:39.750 --> 1:56:41.125
Yeah. It's Clyde.

1:56:41.958 --> 1:56:42.875
This is it!

1:57:17.500 --> 1:57:19.875
-Hey, Ivy. Need some help with that?
-Yeah.

1:57:20.125 --> 1:57:21.042
Let me help you, then.

1:57:26.333 --> 1:57:27.250
Stick 'em up.

1:59:14.958 --> 1:59:16.250
<i>Manos arribas.</i>

1:59:59.417 --> 2:00:00.583
Get back!

2:01:16.583 --> 2:01:19.792
Mr. Hamer? Excuse me, Mr. Hamer?

2:01:19.875 --> 2:01:22.250
There's a fella on the phone
from the Associated Press in New York.

2:01:22.333 --> 2:01:25.417
He says he'll give you $1,000
for a phone interview right now.

2:01:27.042 --> 2:01:28.750
Got him on the line in the back.

2:01:33.250 --> 2:01:34.167
Mr. Hamer?

2:01:37.417 --> 2:01:38.625
Shame on you.

2:02:22.833 --> 2:02:24.292
<i>The nation has been freed</i>

2:02:24.375 --> 2:02:27.125
<i>from the worst killing rampage</i>
<i>in its history.</i>

2:02:27.417 --> 2:02:29.958
<i>Retribution has been served,</i>
<i>and J. Edgar Hoover</i>

2:02:30.042 --> 2:02:31.625
<i>has issued a formal announcement</i>

2:02:31.708 --> 2:02:34.500
<i>that the crime spree of Bonnie and Clyde--</i>

2:02:41.167 --> 2:02:44.125
Care to comment on your role
in the apprehension of Bonnie and Clyde?

2:02:44.208 --> 2:02:46.792
I knew Hamer
and Gault would get the job done,

2:02:46.875 --> 2:02:48.208
and that's why I chose 'em.

2:02:48.292 --> 2:02:49.542
<i>Bottom line!</i>
