WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:05.214
It seems today
that all you see

00:05.297 --> 00:08.383
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.467 --> 00:12.095
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:12.179 --> 00:14.556
On which we used to rely?

00:14.640 --> 00:18.393
Lucky there's a Family Guy

00:18.477 --> 00:21.563
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.647 --> 00:23.148
All the things
that make us

00:23.232 --> 00:24.775
Laugh and cry

00:24.858 --> 00:29.988
He's... a...
Fam...ily... Guy

00:36.203 --> 00:39.122
Peter, thanks a lot
for havin' us out on your boat.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.207
No problem.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.125
Peter, are you sure
Santos and Pasqual

00:42.209 --> 00:44.837
don't mind comin' in
on a Saturday to serve us drinks?

00:44.920 --> 00:46.880
Are you kiddin', Lois?
They're Portuguese.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.173
Work is their cocaine.

00:48.257 --> 00:49.716
Besides, look at them
in their tuxedos.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.426
They look like little people.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.303
(speaking Portuguese)

00:53.387 --> 00:55.430
(speaking Portuguese)

00:58.100 --> 00:59.977
Hey, Meg. What's going on?

01:00.060 --> 01:02.104
What's going on?
You having a good time?

01:02.187 --> 01:04.523
Yeah, no, I'm havin'
a good time.

01:04.606 --> 01:06.942
Uh, hey, what's going on?

01:07.025 --> 01:08.026
Uh, you're,

01:08.110 --> 01:10.362
uh, listen, you're
17 now, right?

01:10.445 --> 01:13.490
Um, uh, I was-- I was just
throwing it out there.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.243
I was thinking, uh, you know,
if you ever want to...

01:16.326 --> 01:18.412
I don't know,
screw around or somethin'.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.746
Uh, hey, Joe.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.373
Uh, so, you know,

01:21.456 --> 01:24.001
it's just something to mull
around in the old noggin.

01:27.004 --> 01:30.465
Damn. What is it about golf
that always brings out the worst in me?

01:30.549 --> 01:34.970
So, Annika Sorenstam, you're, uh,
quite the female golfer, aren't you?

01:35.053 --> 01:37.598
Yes, quite the female golfer.

01:37.681 --> 01:38.682
(gasps)

01:38.765 --> 01:40.809
Ha! I knew it! Look!
Everybody, look! Look!

01:40.893 --> 01:42.519
She's a fraud!

01:42.603 --> 01:44.813
All right, I caught a fish!

01:46.106 --> 01:47.482
Oh, huh.
Sorry about that, Loretta.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.026
Hey, can I have
my fish back?

01:49.109 --> 01:52.154
Oh, you're gonna have to
reach into the cookie jar.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.323
(stuttering)
Well, uh, I can't just...

01:54.406 --> 01:56.074
You're--you're
my best friend's wife.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.451
Reach into... All right!

01:57.534 --> 01:59.203
Yeah, you go in
and get that.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.996
Show that fishy
who's boss.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.956
Loretta, they have
some of that

02:03.040 --> 02:05.626
3-bean salad
you're so fond of.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.961
Hey, Quagmire.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.714
(laughing) Well, we'll, uh,
have to do this again sometime.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.508
You name the time
and the place,

02:12.591 --> 02:13.884
little neck.
(laughing)

02:13.967 --> 02:16.595
(stuttering)

02:19.765 --> 02:20.766
Huh?

02:20.849 --> 02:23.143
Oh, I've always
loved charades.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.394
Your turn, Joe.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.855
The category is
famous people. Okay, guess who I am.

02:26.939 --> 02:28.690
Ironside!
Larry Flynt!

02:28.774 --> 02:31.026
Stephen Hawking!
Uh, Dr. Strangelove!

02:31.109 --> 02:32.945
Roy Campanella!
Richard Petty!

02:33.028 --> 02:34.321
Lance Armstrong!

02:34.404 --> 02:36.031
Neil Armstrong!
Stretch Armstrong!

02:36.114 --> 02:38.242
Stretch Cunningham!
Howard Cunningham! Potsie Weber!

02:38.325 --> 02:39.576
(yelling)

02:40.369 --> 02:43.205
(screaming)

02:43.288 --> 02:45.374
Oh, Natalie Wood.
Definitely Natalie Wood.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.709
Somebody save him,
he can't swim!

02:47.793 --> 02:49.628
Oh, he's not even kicking.
Kick, Joe, kick!

02:49.711 --> 02:51.046
Peter,
he's a paraplegic.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.882
That doesn't mean
he can't hear. Kick, Joe, kick!

02:53.966 --> 02:55.133
(water splashing)

02:56.301 --> 02:58.011
Somebody help him!

03:02.349 --> 03:03.767
Oh, gay!

03:03.851 --> 03:05.352
(gasping)

03:07.354 --> 03:09.773
You were right, Peter.
It was Natalie Wood.

03:14.570 --> 03:17.447
Lois, why the hell
do we have to take a stupid C.P.R. class?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.408
Because, Peter,
none of us knew what to do

03:19.491 --> 03:20.576
when Joe was drowning.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.661
Now, be quiet
and pay attention.

03:22.744 --> 03:26.206
Hi, there. I'd like to
welcome you all to C.P.R.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.750
I see a lot of smiles here
in this room.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.210
There's one.

03:30.294 --> 03:32.045
Oh, there's another.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.505
That's good.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.966
I see that soda
up under your chair.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.677
That's all right.
Soda's all right on my watch.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.306
We also got Oreos here
and fresh coffee.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.141
Everybody likes a snack.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.269
Now, who wants to go first?

03:47.352 --> 03:50.063
Hmm. No takers? Well,
fine. I'll go first.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.690
Peter, why don't you
volunteer?

03:51.773 --> 03:54.318
Oh, no, I don't volunteer
for anything since I helped those guys

03:54.401 --> 03:56.612
repaint the Sistine Chapel.

03:56.695 --> 03:57.779
(gasping)

03:57.863 --> 03:59.823
Yeah, uh, listen, I thought
the stuff that was there

03:59.907 --> 04:01.909
was kind of lame,
so I put this up.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.411
I figured Andre the Giant
would be a little hipper. You know.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.371
Get back some of those boys
you scared away.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.582
And that's pretty much
all there is to it.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.293
Yeah, it's hard, jagged,
and tastes like alcohol.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.712
Just like
kissing Faye Dunaway.

04:13.795 --> 04:14.963
(both laughing)

04:15.047 --> 04:16.632
Easy now.

04:16.715 --> 04:18.800
Well, I can't believe
we just did that. Hmm.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.178
Uh, but, uh, you know,
that--that stuff

04:21.261 --> 04:23.138
about spending the day
together tomorrow, um,

04:23.222 --> 04:25.349
I--I forgot. Actually,
I have a thing.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.976
But, uh, you know,
you have my e-mail address.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.729
So drop me a line.
And then I'll have yours.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.106
And, uh, we'll
take it from there.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.816
So, um...

04:35.776 --> 04:37.277
boop-boop.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.029
Belly button.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.405
Well, I'll see you later.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.074
So, it's official.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.034
Y'all are
card-carrying lifesavers.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.161
Holy crap,
a card with my name on it!

04:46.245 --> 04:49.414
I am now Peter Griffin,
Certified C.P.R.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.834
Come on, Lois!
I've got lives to save.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.460
Thanks. Be safe.

04:53.544 --> 04:55.629
Oh, nobody had
any of the coffee.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.840
Only a couple of Oreos gone.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.008
I'm gonna take the rest home
to the cats.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.513
Sorry, I was
dialing the phone. Are you all right?

05:04.596 --> 05:06.849
Yeah, don't worry about it.
Doesn't look like there's any--

05:06.932 --> 05:09.309
Peter Griffin,
Certified C.P.R. Don't anyone panic!

05:09.393 --> 05:10.394
(screaming)

05:10.477 --> 05:11.979
What the hell are you doing?

05:12.062 --> 05:13.856
-(choking)
-Y-you know, I don't think he's hurt.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.066
I'll get to you in a moment, sir.
All right, I'm gonna have to

05:16.149 --> 05:17.359
check and see
if he soiled himself.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.694
Sir? Sir?
No!

05:18.777 --> 05:20.362
What the hell is
wrong with you?

05:20.445 --> 05:21.613
I've got to check
if you've soiled yourself.

05:21.697 --> 05:22.781
Get off me! Are you crazy?

05:22.865 --> 05:24.366
Sir? I'm gonna need you
to stop struggling, all right?

05:24.449 --> 05:26.201
Leave him alone.
I hurt my elbow!

05:26.285 --> 05:27.828
-I've got to get these trousers off.
-Somebody call the cops!

05:27.911 --> 05:29.371
I gotta see if
you've soiled yourself.

05:29.454 --> 05:30.998
Nobody asked you
to get involved! You idiot!

05:31.081 --> 05:32.666
Get off him, you jackass!

05:32.749 --> 05:34.459
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to step back.

05:34.543 --> 05:35.711
All right, looks like
we're clean down here.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.254
You guys take it easy.
No need to thank me.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.089
Just pay it forward.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.216
So they revoked
your C.P.R. card, huh?

05:41.300 --> 05:44.344
Yeah. I tell you, this is worse
than when they took away my library card

05:44.428 --> 05:45.929
for reading
while intoxicated.

05:46.013 --> 05:49.016
Oh, don't be
ashamed of your hand, Johnny Tremain.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.226
You still live
in exciting times.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.728
Oh, crap!

05:52.811 --> 05:54.897
Sir, do you know how loud
you were reading?

05:54.980 --> 05:57.149
"The life of a silversmith's apprentice
was not an easy one."

05:57.232 --> 05:58.901
(screaming)

05:58.984 --> 06:01.570
I got to figure out some way
to get that card back.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.322
Well, you could always
take the class again.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.990
I mean, I'm sure
they'd give you another card.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.158
(Loretta screaming)

06:06.241 --> 06:07.409
Hey, do you hear that?
What?

06:07.492 --> 06:08.869
Sounds like
someone screaming.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.537
What--what is it, boy?
What are you trying to say?

06:10.621 --> 06:11.914
It sounds like
Loretta is screaming.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.207
Trouble at the old mill?

06:13.290 --> 06:14.958
-What are you, insane?
-Somebody fall through the ice?

06:15.042 --> 06:16.210
It's summer.
Bobcat?

06:16.293 --> 06:17.419
(barking)

06:17.503 --> 06:19.922
Loretta's in trouble?
Come on, boy!

06:20.005 --> 06:22.633
Peter Griffin,
temporarily suspended C.P.R...

06:22.716 --> 06:23.800
Holy crap!

06:24.468 --> 06:26.428
We should go.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.263
Boy, that was embarrassing,
huh?

06:28.347 --> 06:30.265
Walking in on
Loretta and Cleveland having sex.

06:30.349 --> 06:31.391
Uh, Peter,
that wasn't, uh--

06:31.475 --> 06:33.310
You know, for a large,
heavyset black guy,

06:33.393 --> 06:34.978
Cleveland's got a cute,
little white ass.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.939
That wasn't Cleveland.
It was some white guy.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.106
What was that?

06:38.190 --> 06:40.817
Shut up and put some more
of that sugar in my bowl.

06:46.532 --> 06:47.783
Wait a minute.
Brian?

06:47.866 --> 06:49.826
If that wasn't Cleveland
doing it with Loretta,

06:49.910 --> 06:51.787
then Loretta's
having an affair.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.121
Oh, we can't tell anyone
about this.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.791
That is the last thing
in the world we want to do.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.627
What a day! We've done
everything in the world.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.712
So I guess the only thing
left to do is tell you

07:00.796 --> 07:02.089
that Loretta Brown
is having an affair.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.924
Good lord!
Oh, no!

07:04.007 --> 07:05.467
QUAGMIRE (thinks):
Oh, God! I'm screwed.

07:05.551 --> 07:07.469
This is worse than that time
I had to fess up to the nation.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.054
My fellow Americans,

07:09.137 --> 07:12.057
I have not been
entirely truthful with you.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.434
I did ga-googity that girl.

07:14.518 --> 07:17.437
I ga-shmoigedied her
ga-flavety with my googus.

07:17.521 --> 07:18.814
And I am sorry.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.649
Yeah, huh, any idea
who it was, Peter?

07:20.732 --> 07:22.025
No, we didn't see his face.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.110
(sighing)

07:23.193 --> 07:24.903
All we know is
it's a skinny white guy

07:24.987 --> 07:26.822
with a tattoo
on his left butt cheek.

07:26.905 --> 07:27.990
Well, I better
tell Cleveland.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.992
I got a knack
for delivering bad news.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.244
I don't know how to
tell you this, Mr. Devanney.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.495
So I'll let
these guys do it.

07:33.579 --> 07:34.830
(music playing)

07:34.913 --> 07:36.999
-You have AIDS
-Yes, you have AIDS

07:37.082 --> 07:39.042
I hate to tell you, boy,
that you have AIDS

07:39.126 --> 07:40.210
You got the AIDS

07:40.294 --> 07:44.673
You may have caught it
when you stuck that filthy needle in here

07:44.756 --> 07:47.843
Or maybe all
that unprotected sex put you here

07:47.926 --> 07:49.887
It isn't clear
But what we're certain of

07:49.970 --> 07:51.930
-Is you have AIDS
-Yes, you have AIDS

07:52.014 --> 07:56.685
-Not H.I.V., but...
-Full-blown AIDS

07:56.768 --> 08:00.522
Be sure that you see

08:00.606 --> 08:07.029
That this is not H.I.V.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.364
But full-blown AIDS

08:09.448 --> 08:12.576
Not H.I.V., but really
full-blown AIDS

08:12.659 --> 08:17.080
I'm sorry I wish it was
something less serious

08:17.164 --> 08:19.583
But it's AIDS

08:19.666 --> 08:21.210
You've got

08:21.293 --> 08:27.132
The AIDS

08:29.384 --> 08:31.178
So, listen,
Cleveland. Um,

08:31.261 --> 08:32.930
the reason I asked you
out here,

08:33.013 --> 08:35.432
uh, I've been
wanting to talk to you about something.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.017
In Superman II,

08:37.100 --> 08:39.019
what is the story
with that cellophane "S"

08:39.102 --> 08:42.022
that Superman rips off his chest
and throws at the bad guy?

08:42.981 --> 08:45.943
Prepare to be destroyed,
Superman!

08:47.528 --> 08:49.488
(grunts)

08:49.571 --> 08:51.698
-What was that?
-Yeah, take that, you jerk.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.116
That was
a minor inconvenience.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.202
Yeah, well, that's the idea.
Slowed you down.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.411
I'll say. Ow.

08:56.495 --> 08:57.913
-Didn't see that coming, did you?
-No.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.790
Yeah, well,
you know, take that.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.834
Which actually brings me
to my next point:

09:01.917 --> 09:04.127
-Uh, your wife's cheating on you.
-What?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.713
Yeah, uh, i-it's actually
a pretty funny story,

09:06.797 --> 09:07.798
uh, true story.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.633
Uh, Brian and I
walked into your house

09:09.716 --> 09:11.426
and, uh, she was
with some guy going,

09:11.510 --> 09:13.720
bam, bam, bam,
bam, bam!

09:13.804 --> 09:15.430
Uh, Peter, uh, maybe--
Hang on, I'm not done.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.099
Bam, bam, bam!

09:17.182 --> 09:20.686
And then she's all,
"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."

09:20.769 --> 09:22.104
Bam, bam, bam!

09:22.187 --> 09:23.647
You want to take it
from here, Bamm-Bamm?

09:23.730 --> 09:25.315
Bam, bam,
bam, bam, bam!

09:25.399 --> 09:26.900
-You want to take it from here, Emeril?
-Bam!

09:26.984 --> 09:29.570
So that's what
we're dealing with here. Any thoughts?

09:31.905 --> 09:34.283
Loretta, is it true
what they're saying?

09:34.366 --> 09:37.953
Were you really having carnal relations
with another gentleman?

09:38.036 --> 09:41.373
I'm a woman, Cleveland.
I need some passion in my life.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.668
I need a real man.
And Lord knows that ain't you.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.504
Well, I admit
after a long day at work

09:47.588 --> 09:48.964
I don't always come home

09:49.047 --> 09:53.677
with that "Riunite on ice,
that's nice" mentality.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.345
And for that, I apologize.

09:55.429 --> 09:59.516
Apologize? I cheat on you
and you apologize to me?

09:59.600 --> 10:02.186
Cleveland Brown,
you are pathetic!

10:02.269 --> 10:05.606
I disagree, but I
respect your candor.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.024
Good-bye, Cleveland.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.401
I love you.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.236
(doorbell ringing)

10:12.154 --> 10:13.238
Oh, hi, Cleveland.

10:13.322 --> 10:14.656
Hey, what are you
doing here?

10:14.740 --> 10:16.533
Oh, Loretta kicked me out.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.785
Oh, Cleveland,
I am so sorry.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.704
You can stay here
as long as you like.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.289
Cleveland, sit down.

10:22.372 --> 10:26.168
I want to sing a little song that, uh,
kept me going when I had troubles.

10:27.503 --> 10:31.882
(intro to The B-52's
Rock Lobster)

10:31.965 --> 10:33.425
We were at the beach

10:34.468 --> 10:37.054
Everybody had
matching towels

10:37.137 --> 10:39.348
Somebody went under a dock

10:39.431 --> 10:41.975
And there they saw a rock

10:42.059 --> 10:44.061
But it wasn't a rock

10:45.020 --> 10:47.981
It was a rock lobster

10:52.486 --> 10:54.071
Rock lobster

10:57.824 --> 10:59.409
Rock lobster

11:02.579 --> 11:03.747
(laughing)

11:03.830 --> 11:05.958
Yeah, you're gonna be okay.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.922
Now, everybody,
Cleveland's gonna be

11:12.005 --> 11:13.423
staying with us
for a few days.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.926
That's right, kids.
So just treat him like one of the family.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.428
You mean like Cousin Janine
who we're polite to,

11:18.512 --> 11:21.265
but then mock her diabetes
on the drive home?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.976
(laughs)
She can't eat caramel.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.019
Exactly.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.855
Can I-- can I
touch your hair?

11:27.938 --> 11:30.107
I-I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna touch it.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.359
(laughing)
It's like a sheep!

11:33.694 --> 11:36.488
You know, Peter,
I'm a little worried about Cleveland.

11:36.572 --> 11:38.824
His wife cheated on him,
kicked him out of the house,

11:38.907 --> 11:40.659
and he doesn't seem
at all affected by it.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.453
He's probably bottling up his emotions.
That's not good for you.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.957
Right. I almost got an ulcer
after you shelled out $200 for tickets

11:47.040 --> 11:49.042
to Crossing Over
with John Edward.

11:49.126 --> 11:51.753
I'm sensing an "A."
Does your name begin with an "A"?

11:51.837 --> 11:52.963
No.
A "B"?

11:53.046 --> 11:56.967
-No.
-C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P?

11:57.050 --> 11:58.510
"P"! Peter! My name's Peter!

11:58.594 --> 11:59.595
Is your name Peter?

11:59.678 --> 12:01.972
Wow, you are
some kind of sorcerer.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.891
What Cleveland
really needs right now

12:03.974 --> 12:05.434
is to learn how to
express his feelings.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.478
No, what he needs right now
is a revenge lay.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.023
And I know
just who to talk to.

12:14.443 --> 12:15.569
(whirring)

12:15.652 --> 12:16.987
(doorbell ringing)

12:17.821 --> 12:18.822
Oh, God!

12:18.906 --> 12:20.616
Huh. Sorry, guys.
Let me throw something on.

12:20.699 --> 12:21.700
(gasps)

12:23.744 --> 12:24.912
Peter, look!

12:24.995 --> 12:26.538
Holy crap,
that's the tattoo!

12:26.622 --> 12:29.791
Well, I think we're about to find out
who the culprit is.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.044
5-5-5-0-1-4-3.

12:32.127 --> 12:34.546
Peter, I--
Shut up, Brian! I'm sleuthing.

12:34.630 --> 12:35.631
(phone ringing)

12:35.714 --> 12:36.715
Hello?
Quagmire?

12:36.798 --> 12:38.133
Yeah.
Hey, it's Peter.

12:38.217 --> 12:40.928
What's going on, buddy?
We're at your house.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.304
Peter, he's the one we saw

12:42.387 --> 12:44.014
-sleeping with Loretta!
-Oh, my God!

12:44.097 --> 12:45.516
Damn it, I knew
this was gonna happen!

12:45.599 --> 12:47.893
Look, I didn't mean it,
you know? I--I knew it was a mistake!

12:47.976 --> 12:49.853
It never felt right!
Please don't tell Cleveland!

12:49.937 --> 12:52.147
Well, all right,
Quagmire.

12:52.231 --> 12:54.566
Cleveland,
Quagmire's sleeping with your wife!

12:54.650 --> 12:57.069
What?
Quagmire slept with Loretta?

12:57.152 --> 12:58.862
Oh, my God, Cleveland!

12:58.946 --> 13:00.447
I am so sorry.

13:00.531 --> 13:02.991
I can only imagine
what you must be feeling right now.

13:03.075 --> 13:05.118
-It's okay.
-It's okay?

13:05.202 --> 13:07.621
It's okay to be betrayed
by your wife and best friend?

13:07.704 --> 13:09.206
Better it be Quagmire

13:09.289 --> 13:11.917
than someone she could
get a disease from.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.710
Cleveland, don't you see?

13:13.794 --> 13:15.420
This is why
your wife left you.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.214
You don't have
any passion.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.050
Sometimes a woman
wants to see her man be a man.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.760
You got to push back
a little!

13:21.844 --> 13:23.053
You got to get
a little rough!

13:23.136 --> 13:25.430
Oh, God! Peter, hit me!
Yeah!

13:25.514 --> 13:27.015
(screaming)

13:28.433 --> 13:30.394
Wow, so that's, uh,
that's something,

13:30.477 --> 13:32.688
about Quagmire and, uh,
Loretta, huh?

13:32.771 --> 13:34.606
Cleveland, we got to get
your manhood back.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.733
Now, the first thing
we're gonna do is take you to a good,

13:36.817 --> 13:38.318
old-fashioned,
wrestling match.

13:38.402 --> 13:39.736
(woman chattering
over P.A. system)

13:39.820 --> 13:40.988
(audience cheering)

13:41.071 --> 13:43.073
All right, Cleveland.
Nothing like a good smackdown

13:43.156 --> 13:44.366
to get
the testosterone going.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.578
I must be in Quahog
'cause all I see

13:47.661 --> 13:48.954
is a bunch of hicks!

13:49.037 --> 13:50.038
(all hooting)

13:50.122 --> 13:51.540
Oh, you take that back,
Macho Man Randy Savage!

13:51.623 --> 13:53.834
Oh, don't he make you so mad you just
want to go down there and hit him?

13:53.917 --> 13:54.960
No.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.503
Well, maybe not him
'cause he's kind of big.

13:56.587 --> 13:58.630
But don't you want to hit
the guy sitting next to you?

13:58.714 --> 13:59.923
Well, not him
'cause he's kind of big, too.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.758
But don't you want to
hit his kid?

14:01.842 --> 14:04.636
Take that, Macho Man
Randy Savage. You jerk.

14:07.264 --> 14:10.809
All right, Cleveland. If this doesn't
light a fire in your belly, nothing will.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.895
Hey, look at me.
I'm Quagmire.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.104
I had sex with your wife.

14:14.188 --> 14:15.772
Giggity-giggity
giggity-giggity.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.065
(laughing)

14:17.149 --> 14:20.569
Those are so his mannerisms.

14:20.652 --> 14:23.405
-Peter, what the hell are you doing?
-I'm not Peter, I'm Quagmire.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.240
-And I'm doing you, Loretta.
-What the hell?

14:25.324 --> 14:26.909
-Oh, you like that? Yeah. Yeah.
-Hey!

14:26.992 --> 14:28.076
Much better than Cleveland.
You sweet thing.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.244
Hey, Peter, knock it off!

14:29.328 --> 14:30.913
-Get you damn hands off me you son of a--
-You like it dirty, don't you?

14:30.996 --> 14:32.497
-Easy girl. Easy.
-What the hell are you doing?

14:32.581 --> 14:33.749
-What is that in your pocket?
-Cleveland can't satisfy you.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.627
-Lois! Somebody!
-Quagmire's got you. Yeah, yeah.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.086
(growling)

14:38.170 --> 14:40.214
Glenn Quagmire,

14:40.297 --> 14:41.965
you're dead!

14:42.049 --> 14:45.052
(Popeye theme music playing)

14:45.135 --> 14:46.845
(tooting)

14:54.186 --> 14:55.687
(growling)

14:55.771 --> 14:57.439
All right, all right.
Calm down, Cleveland.

14:57.523 --> 15:00.234
I'm gonna kill Quagmire!

15:00.317 --> 15:03.487
Oh, God, you're hyperventilating!
Chris, get me a bag.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.448
Okay, Cleveland,
breathe into the bag. It'll calm you down.

15:06.532 --> 15:08.575
-Uh, Peter, I'm not sure that that's--
-Not now, Lois!

15:08.659 --> 15:11.203
Okay, C-C... Okay, Cleveland,
Cleveland, relax, relax, relax.

15:11.286 --> 15:12.621
Relax, relax.

15:12.704 --> 15:13.789
There you go.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.207
There you go. Okay.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.291
Shh-shh-shh.

15:16.375 --> 15:17.584
It's okay. It's okay.

15:17.668 --> 15:18.794
It's all gonna be okay.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.462
Peter, you better do
your C.P.R.

15:20.546 --> 15:22.464
There's no time, Lois.
I got to go warn Quagmire

15:22.548 --> 15:24.925
while I got the chance.
Quick, to the Peter-copter!

15:27.261 --> 15:28.804
(engine revving)

15:30.973 --> 15:33.350
(screaming)

15:33.433 --> 15:36.228
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, my God! Ow!

15:36.311 --> 15:37.479
Peter, what the hell?

15:37.563 --> 15:39.398
Joe, Joe, get inside!
The blades are still spinning!

15:39.481 --> 15:40.482
Oh, my God, Peter!

15:40.566 --> 15:42.150
What is that thing?
Joe! Get inside!

15:42.234 --> 15:43.944
It's tearing up my yard!
Oh, oh God!

15:44.027 --> 15:45.153
Oh, my God!
No, no!

15:45.237 --> 15:46.446
(screaming)

15:47.865 --> 15:49.324
(sighing)

15:49.408 --> 15:50.534
Oh, Joe,

15:50.617 --> 15:52.244
oh, I am sorry, buddy.
It's okay.

15:52.327 --> 15:53.787
Are you okay? You all right?
Look, it's okay.

15:53.871 --> 15:55.622
It's okay, I'm fine.
Oh, boy.

15:55.706 --> 15:57.499
Everybody's fine.
Oh, that was scary.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.962
-Peter, what are we doing here?
-Trust me, Quagmire.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.715
Cleveland will never think
to look for you at Mayor West's house.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.008
Hey, there.
How you doing?

16:06.091 --> 16:07.426
Good evening, gentlemen.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.553
Listen, Mayor West, my friend
Quagmire here's in trouble.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.888
He needs a place
to stay tonight.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.557
Say no more.
I'll protect you, sir.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.769
It is my job. I only ask
that you do not feed my cat, Bootsie,

16:17.853 --> 16:20.439
as he's already eaten
and might throw up.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.360
Well, Derwood,

16:25.444 --> 16:27.863
now you really are
the big man of the house.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.531
Mother, change him back.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.452
You know, Endora, uh,
I'm getting a little sick of this crap.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.162
You ever seen one of these?
Huh?

16:35.245 --> 16:37.206
-You know what this is? Huh?
-No!

16:37.289 --> 16:38.624
Yeah, it's holy water.
Huh? Yeah.

16:38.707 --> 16:40.918
-(screaming)
-Try it. Yeah? How's that feel? Huh?

16:41.001 --> 16:43.962
You like that? Huh?
Power of Christ compels you, bitch.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.589
I hate Bewitched.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.549
(growling)

16:47.633 --> 16:50.761
STEWIE: Hey, so that's
a pretty reasonable reaction, huh?

16:52.721 --> 16:55.933
It's all right to go to sleep, my friend.
I'll stand guard.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.559
Uh, okay.

16:57.643 --> 16:59.561
Don't worry.
I'll be here all night.

16:59.645 --> 17:03.190
Just don't try
to make me smile. I'm forbidden to smile.

17:05.734 --> 17:06.777
Oh, no. Huh.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.947
That episode of Growing Pains
when Mike's friend Boner

17:10.030 --> 17:12.157
ran for student council.
(chuckling)

17:12.241 --> 17:16.662
Boner.
His name was B-B-Boner.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.247
(chuckling)

17:20.791 --> 17:22.543
(laughing)

17:34.054 --> 17:35.305
I've failed you.

17:35.389 --> 17:37.766
Uh, this is, uh,
kind of creeping me out. I'm gonna go.

17:37.850 --> 17:39.309
Take this, for protection.

17:39.393 --> 17:41.937
What the hell's this for?
When the time comes,

17:42.020 --> 17:43.021
you'll know.

17:44.398 --> 17:47.192
I'll teach him to mess
with my wife.

17:47.276 --> 17:48.944
Oh, hi, Cleveland.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.737
Will, uh, you be
joining us for dinner?

17:50.821 --> 17:52.197
(growling)

17:52.281 --> 17:55.409
Okay, then.
He's a wrecking machine!

17:55.492 --> 17:58.161
Peter, we have got to do
something about Cleveland.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.705
I think you created
a monster.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.498
Well, there's only
one thing to do, Lois.

18:01.582 --> 18:04.001
We've got to get
Loretta and Cleveland back together.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.211
And I know just
how to do it.

18:06.295 --> 18:07.754
To the Hinden-Peter!

18:09.214 --> 18:10.424
(engine roaring)

18:11.717 --> 18:13.594
(explosion)

18:13.677 --> 18:14.928
JOE:
Oh, my God!

18:15.012 --> 18:17.097
PETER:
Joe, I am so sorry.

18:17.181 --> 18:19.224
JOE:
How can you afford these things?

18:20.559 --> 18:21.727
(phone beeping)

18:21.810 --> 18:23.896
Yeah, Cleveland,
this is Quagmire. Uh, listen,

18:23.979 --> 18:25.355
I feel awful.

18:25.439 --> 18:27.649
Why don't you come on over
and we can try to get things back

18:27.733 --> 18:29.943
to the way they used to be?
Remember how it was?

18:30.027 --> 18:34.239
Perhaps here there are
many unsuspecting foxes

18:34.323 --> 18:35.741
to have sex with us.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.493
That is why we
wear tight pants

18:38.577 --> 18:40.412
to show our bulges.

18:40.495 --> 18:44.416
-We are...
-BOTH: Two wild and crazy guys!

18:44.499 --> 18:46.502
You guys look stupid.

18:46.585 --> 18:48.253
Anyway, let's
talk this thing through.

18:48.337 --> 18:49.463
(thunder cracking)

18:50.797 --> 18:52.424
Oh, uh, huh,
hey, Cleveland.

18:52.508 --> 18:53.592
I was just
leaving you a message.

18:53.675 --> 18:57.679
You violated the sanctity
of my marriage.

18:57.763 --> 18:58.764
(yelling)

19:01.350 --> 19:03.185
(continues yelling)

19:07.314 --> 19:08.815
(continues yelling)

19:10.817 --> 19:12.778
When the time comes,

19:12.861 --> 19:14.112
you'll know.

19:17.282 --> 19:18.283
Damn it!

19:18.367 --> 19:19.952
(grunts)

19:23.080 --> 19:24.414
Oh, this is awful!

19:24.498 --> 19:27.125
Somebody stop them!
Do something!

19:30.754 --> 19:32.339
Good.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.842
Let the hate flow through you.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.009
You're not helping!

19:37.886 --> 19:39.638
Oh, I can't.

19:39.721 --> 19:42.724
It isn't in me
to cause harm to anyone.

19:42.808 --> 19:46.061
No matter how much
someone has harmed me.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.855
I'm sorry,
Cleveland.

19:47.938 --> 19:49.857
Cleveland, I think
this beautiful woman

19:49.940 --> 19:51.483
would like to say
something to you.

19:51.567 --> 19:54.111
You told me this was
Lois' intervention.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.487
Nice. Cleveland?

19:55.571 --> 19:59.074
Loretta, what you did
was unforgivable.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.326
This marriage is over.

20:01.410 --> 20:02.661
Well, that's just fine,
Cleveland.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.663
'Cause I am through
being your wife.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.790
Well, I may not
be perfect,

20:06.874 --> 20:09.084
but I deserve
better than you.

20:09.168 --> 20:10.377
Look at that, Lois.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.797
As beautiful as
an HBO minority fairy tale.

20:13.881 --> 20:15.841
But, Peter, their marriage
is ending.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.634
Well, look
at the bright side, Lois.

20:17.718 --> 20:20.304
It's a chance for a fresh start
for both Cleveland and...

20:20.387 --> 20:21.930
(screaming)

20:22.014 --> 20:23.849
Oh, my God!

20:23.932 --> 20:26.435
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

20:26.518 --> 20:28.061
What the hell, man?

20:28.145 --> 20:30.606
-Hurts, doesn't it? What the hell-- yes!
-What the hell's your problem?

20:30.689 --> 20:32.566
My friend? My friend?
What?

20:32.649 --> 20:34.234
You've been kicked
in the nuts.

20:34.318 --> 20:36.195
-(people cheering)
-No way!

20:36.278 --> 20:37.404
(laughing)
You're gonna be on TV.

20:37.487 --> 20:39.406
Oh, sweet!

20:39.489 --> 20:41.533
Oh, my God.
Wow! We love that show.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.785
Oh, that is awesome. Hey, hi.

20:43.869 --> 20:45.787
-You're on it.
-Oh, wow.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.458
Glenn, you sure
you want to do this?

20:49.541 --> 20:51.668
I already told you
I forgive you.

20:51.752 --> 20:54.004
No, no, I feel like
I got off too easy.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.423
All right. If you insist.

20:56.507 --> 20:58.759
You, uh, wanna
ring the bell, Apollo?

20:58.842 --> 20:59.927
All right.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.637
Ding, ding.

21:06.475 --> 21:07.476
(bell dings)

21:07.559 --> 21:09.561
It's the eye of the tiger

21:09.645 --> 21:11.522
It's the thrill
of the fight

21:11.605 --> 21:13.023
Risin' up

21:13.106 --> 21:15.984
To the challenge
of our rival

21:19.446 --> 21:21.657
