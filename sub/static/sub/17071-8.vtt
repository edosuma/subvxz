19:59.432 --> 20:02.235
I don't really love toys.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.870
I see you playing with

20:03.903 --> 20:06.038
your little stuffed animals
all the time.

20:06.072 --> 20:09.242
My Beanie Babies aren't toys,
they're friends.

20:09.276 --> 20:12.545
Mom, there's no vacancy
in my heart for new friends.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.746
The inn is full.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.215
Well, then, why did you
ask me for an Elmo?

20:16.249 --> 20:18.451
You really wanted me to
pick a toy,

20:18.485 --> 20:19.919
so I picked
the hardest one to get

20:19.952 --> 20:21.954
since I know
you like a challenge.

20:21.988 --> 20:25.558
Giving me Christmas presents
is what you like to do.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.827
It makes me happy
that it makes you happy.

20:29.829 --> 20:33.800
Well, now it's my turn
to make you happy.

20:33.833 --> 20:37.236
Come on, tell Mommy what
you really want for Christmas.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.406
I just want to
spend time with you.

20:39.439 --> 20:43.242
I know you're not supposed
to have favorites,

20:43.276 --> 20:45.878
but then you say
things like that

20:45.912 --> 20:47.647
and what am I
supposed to do?

20:49.749 --> 20:50.817
You're my favorite.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.619
I know.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.592
Mom!
It's Christmas day.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.294
Why do we have to see
"Jingle All the Way" again?

21:01.328 --> 21:02.629
Because Evan missed it.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.597
I remember where you all laughed
the first time.

21:04.631 --> 21:07.467
If I don't hear the same laughs
at the same moments, I'll know.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.968
Except for
the Sinbad lines,

21:09.001 --> 21:10.903
I laughed
all the way through.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.772
Evan, popcorn.

21:14.641 --> 21:15.975
Chili cups?

21:16.008 --> 21:18.244
-Yes, please.
-[ Laughs ]

21:18.277 --> 21:20.313
Merry Christmas,
Chili Boy Marv.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.982
Merry Christmas,
Chili Boy Lou.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.285
This is the fourth time
we have seen this movie.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.787
It has to be the last.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.989
No way.
