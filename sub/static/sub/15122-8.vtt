WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.873
* So many sounds
don't bother you *

00:05.939 --> 00:08.709
* Mail through the slot *

00:08.776 --> 00:12.180
* The clock's cuckoo *

00:12.246 --> 00:15.816
* Gunshot sounds that come
from the TV *

00:15.883 --> 00:18.886
* Then there's the sound that
gets you all worked up *

00:18.952 --> 00:20.788
* Start wagging tails
and just freak out *

00:20.854 --> 00:24.492
* 'Cause remember that
you're always safe with me *

00:24.558 --> 00:26.660
* 'Cause it's the doorbell,
just the doorbell *

00:26.727 --> 00:29.563
* And all your barking
is becoming a pain in my ass *

00:29.630 --> 00:31.899
* It's just the doorbell,
the freaking doorbell *

00:31.965 --> 00:33.501
* But it's probably just your
owner or the nice guy *

00:33.567 --> 00:35.103
* That comes to read the gas. *
(doorbell rings)

00:35.169 --> 00:38.339
(barking and whining)

00:38.406 --> 00:41.209
Good job, guys.
I'm seeing improvement.

00:43.944 --> 00:46.314
Hi. I was wondering
where Miss Hope

00:46.380 --> 00:48.282
Rope-a-Dope was.
(grunting)

00:48.349 --> 00:49.483
Sorry she's late.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.253
Jimmy was moving according
to coffee-pot time,

00:52.320 --> 00:54.388
which is usually ten minutes
fast, but it crapped out

00:54.455 --> 00:55.723
in the middle of the night,

00:55.789 --> 00:59.560
so we're all kinda on
microwave time today.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.329
Gotcha.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.765
Hey, what happened
to your dead tooth?

01:04.832 --> 01:06.267
Oh, I got rid of it.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.469
I thought it made me unique,
but then I saw

01:08.536 --> 01:10.504
this hilarious episode of It's
Always Sunny in Philadelphia,

01:10.571 --> 01:12.873
and there was this girl
with a dead tooth.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.242
Crazy, right?

01:14.308 --> 01:15.543
And everyone was
always making

01:15.609 --> 01:17.511
fun of her,
so before anyone made fun of me,

01:17.578 --> 01:18.812
I figured I'd get it fixed.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.881
Mmm.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.083
The other kids not here yet?

01:23.151 --> 01:25.253
Oh, no, Hope's
the only kid left.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.221
Jessie and Phoebe moved on
to real school,

01:27.288 --> 01:29.457
and Jenny's mother's trying the
whole stay-at-home-mom thing

01:29.523 --> 01:31.159
now that they got her
medications sorted out.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.161
What about the old people
you were watching?

01:33.227 --> 01:35.529
Dead. Waiting on a new batch
to come in.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.566
Hope's not afraid to get in
there and mix it up, though.

01:46.874 --> 01:47.808
I'm telling you, Jimmy,

01:47.875 --> 01:49.577
it's a great day care
and everything,

01:49.643 --> 01:51.645
but she can't grow up
only around dogs.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.614
How embarrassed are
you gonna be at

01:53.681 --> 01:55.883
Sunday school when she starts
humping the minister's leg?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.251
I appreciate your concern,

01:57.318 --> 01:59.287
and I do wish Hope had some
other kids there,

01:59.353 --> 02:01.121
but for now I'm sure she's fine.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.022
(doorbell rings)

02:02.089 --> 02:03.591
(barks)

02:05.259 --> 02:06.727
Did your baby just bark?

02:07.895 --> 02:09.330
No, maybe she burped.

02:09.397 --> 02:10.864
(doorbell rings)

02:10.931 --> 02:11.899
(barks)

02:14.001 --> 02:14.902
Hiccup?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.472
(doorbell rings)

02:18.539 --> 02:19.873
(barks)

02:21.108 --> 02:22.910
Okay, she barked.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.512
(doorbell ringing)

02:24.578 --> 02:26.013
What does this button do?

02:26.079 --> 02:28.649
(doorbell rings,
Hope barks)

02:30.218 --> 02:31.952
* Whoo! *

02:32.019 --> 02:33.254
* Here we go *

02:33.321 --> 02:36.424
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

02:38.058 --> 02:39.927
(door opens, shuts)

02:41.629 --> 02:44.432
Is that another brochure
about joining the Air Force?

02:44.498 --> 02:47.167
No, it's a brochure
for a private preschool

02:47.235 --> 02:49.237
one of my client's kids
goes to-- Marcy.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.638
Good kid, smart.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.374
She reads the tabloids
to me while I'm cleaning.

02:53.441 --> 02:54.408
We can't afford this place.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.244
Go to the page
with the black kid.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.814
Uh, yeah, it looks like they
have a great computer center.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.183
No, not the picture

03:03.251 --> 03:04.885
of the black kid
with glasses.

03:04.952 --> 03:07.855
The one where he's high-fiving
the Mexican girl.

03:07.921 --> 03:11.124
Ah, they have
scholarships, cool.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.560
But these are for poor people.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.027
What do you think we are?

03:14.094 --> 03:15.162
I don't know.

03:15.229 --> 03:18.966
Like, lower-lower-lower
middle class?

03:19.032 --> 03:21.869
I'm gonna take these
to the bottle return place.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.438
Huh, it's like a tunnel.

03:27.241 --> 03:32.212
He does all that for $1.90,
and you think we're not poor?

03:36.450 --> 03:38.652
Check out all those fancy
guys who went here.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.154
Those are the presidents
of the United States.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.791
I remember that guy.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.426
So handsome.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.227
Check it out.
There's one
named Grover.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.929
(all snicker)

03:48.996 --> 03:50.030
Grover.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.532
All right, everybody,

03:51.599 --> 03:55.369
these applications are due
in two weeks.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.471
Unfortunately, we only have
enough grant money

03:57.538 --> 03:59.106
to cover one poor student.

03:59.172 --> 04:00.774
We are totally winning this.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.243
There's no way these people
are poorer than us.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.446
Okay, does anybody have
any questions?

04:05.513 --> 04:08.682
I do. I was wondering,
I had seen on

04:08.749 --> 04:11.285
the neighborhood watch Web site
that there was a sex offender

04:11.352 --> 04:12.986
living not far from the school.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.988
What's a neighborhood watch
Web site?

04:15.055 --> 04:19.627
It's a Web site that tells you
where the people who've been

04:19.693 --> 04:20.961
convicted of
sexual-related
crimes live.

04:21.028 --> 04:25.198
There's a blue dot over
their house.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.701
Oh, we use the computer
at the library,

04:27.768 --> 04:30.103
since we can't
afford our own.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.839
No, we forced that person out.

04:31.905 --> 04:35.343
Now the closest blue dot is way,
way, way over on

04:35.409 --> 04:37.911
the other side of town
by the dangerous mall

04:37.978 --> 04:39.279
in Lacey Park.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.981
We live in Lacey Park.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.550
By the dangerous mall.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.753
We're so poor, we live
by the dangerous mall.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.590
I'll kill him.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.291
I'll strangle him
with his own perverted

04:51.359 --> 04:53.260
sexual-offending hands!

04:53.327 --> 04:54.728
How do you know
it's a him?

04:54.795 --> 04:57.097
I bet it's that woman who lives
up the street

04:57.164 --> 04:58.699
whose bushes look like wieners.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.668
No one sees that
but you, Mom.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.504
There it is, the blue dot.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.509
They live really close to us.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.511
On our block.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.947
In our house!

05:17.851 --> 05:20.388
Huh.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.393
It's obviously a mistake.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.495
It says here "lewd acts
with a 15-year-old."

05:27.561 --> 05:30.230
It didn't happen!
It's lying!

05:30.297 --> 05:33.534
Wait a minute.
This is ringing a bell.

05:33.601 --> 05:37.270
Burt, you remember
Donna Passani's Sweet 16?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.407
We were all doing it in cars

05:39.473 --> 05:41.208
in the Knights of
Columbus parking lot,

05:41.274 --> 05:43.911
and we got caught by a cop?

05:43.977 --> 05:45.045
You got arrested!

05:45.112 --> 05:46.179
Oh, yeah!

05:46.246 --> 05:48.749
I was only 15, he was 17.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.618
That's where
that blue dot's from.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.753
So you sexually offended Mom?

05:52.820 --> 05:55.856
It wasn't Burt's fault.
I developed early.

05:55.923 --> 05:59.893
You're still that smoking hot,
nasty, sex-crazed chick to me.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.163
(both moaning)

06:03.230 --> 06:05.499
You know, the school does
a background check, and we're

06:05.566 --> 06:08.235
not gonna get in
if we have a dot on this house.

06:08.301 --> 06:11.739
He's right.
We need to do something.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.575
I want my granddaughter
to go to that school

06:14.642 --> 06:16.977
and have a chance to do
great things.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.080
Whoever heard of a rich
and successful dog?

06:20.147 --> 06:21.915
I can think of eight
right off the bat.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.652
Plus, Hope is gonna want
to have friends over one day,

06:24.718 --> 06:27.320
and no one will come
because there's a stigmatism

06:27.387 --> 06:28.456
attached to our house.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.090
What am I supposed to do?

06:30.157 --> 06:31.992
Make a time machine,
work the kinks out,

06:32.059 --> 06:33.461
go back in time,
then remember

06:33.527 --> 06:35.028
not to smush parts
with your mom?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.129
Is that what you want?

06:36.196 --> 06:37.765
'Cause then you
wouldn't even be born!

06:37.831 --> 06:39.132
Just like Back to the Future!

06:39.199 --> 06:41.334
Am I the only one that watches
movies in this house?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.904
Burt, this is serious business.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.906
We'll need to hire a lawyer.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.575
Then we'll have
to get dressed up

06:47.641 --> 06:49.276
and go to an office park.
Come on, man!

06:49.342 --> 06:51.512
I don't want to open this can
of worms now!

06:51.579 --> 06:52.746
You have to!

06:52.813 --> 06:54.748
We gotta make that dot
disappear!

06:57.217 --> 07:00.754
There, it's gone.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.590
When you have
legal trouble,

07:02.656 --> 07:04.692
you don't just
need a lawyer,

07:04.758 --> 07:06.660
you need a friend.

07:06.727 --> 07:09.830
So call me, Wally Phipps.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.600
I may charge
for legal services,

07:12.666 --> 07:15.536
but the hugs
are free.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.944
So I need you
to sponge this
from my record.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.613
Can you do that?

07:25.679 --> 07:30.117
Well, I can get you a court date
in a week, but, uh...

07:30.183 --> 07:32.085
Oh, Gilligan!

07:32.152 --> 07:33.587
This is a problem.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.689
Your registration
is in arrears.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.090
Oh, hey, I don't know

07:37.157 --> 07:40.293
what that cop wrote, but
we were doing it normal style.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.995
Yeah, that is not my bag.

07:42.062 --> 07:45.766
No, I meant you have to go
door-to-door

07:45.833 --> 07:48.335
in your neighborhood
and identify yourself

07:48.401 --> 07:51.639
as a sexual offender living
in the neighborhood.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.674
Otherwise, you'll get in
even more trouble.

07:57.611 --> 07:58.946
(groans)

08:20.233 --> 08:23.837
Hi. Are you looking for someone
to care for your lawn?

08:23.904 --> 08:25.539
'Cause I'm not one of those
mow-and-blow guys.

08:25.606 --> 08:29.610
I will weed, prune, plant.
I'm dependable, trustworthy.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.880
Uh, here's my card.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.882
Also, I'm a sex offender.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.619
Good news,
I'm not a Jehovah's Witness.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.188
Bad news, I'm a sex offender.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.056
Hello, I'm your neighbor
Burt Chance.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.726
I just wanted to let you know
there's a sexual predator

08:45.793 --> 08:47.394
living in your neighborhood.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.829
(coughs): It's me.

08:48.896 --> 08:51.999
About eight years ago,
I borrowed your staple gun.

08:52.065 --> 08:55.268
Also, I'm a sexual predator.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.674
(woman shrieking)

09:00.741 --> 09:04.077
(Burt gasping)
(stapler clicking)

09:04.144 --> 09:05.879
(child giggles)

09:12.953 --> 09:15.355
Hey, I'm shaving ham here, man!

09:15.422 --> 09:17.024
You're not being funny.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.059
I'm not trying to be funny.

09:19.126 --> 09:22.062
I, uh, finished proofing
Hope's preschool application.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.732
You're a pretty big fan
of exclamation points, huh?

09:24.798 --> 09:26.266
Yeah, I thought

09:26.333 --> 09:27.601
it made it more exciting.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.136
Is this more exciting?!

09:29.202 --> 09:32.205
Or does it just seem
like I'm weird?!

09:32.272 --> 09:35.876
Yeah, okay, well, that's why
I wrote it in pencil, see?

09:35.943 --> 09:37.711
We're gonna need to jazz this
form up a bit.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.780
You got to sell
yourself, like, um,

09:39.847 --> 09:41.081
say you served in Iraq.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.416
No, Afghanistan.
It's a better war.

09:43.483 --> 09:45.018
Would you stop it?!

09:45.085 --> 09:47.921
Stuff like this is why Barney
doesn't let you use the slicer.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.857
I don't want to use the slicer.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.291
Listen, seriously,
you're gonna have

09:51.358 --> 09:53.894
to spice this up
a little.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.395
I'm not gonna lie.

09:55.462 --> 09:58.732
I don't want Hope's future
based on dishonesty.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.834
Well, suit yourself,
Mr. Honesty.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.302
But whatever you do...

10:02.369 --> 10:05.639
take it easy on the exclams!

10:05.706 --> 10:07.374
It's my birthday.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.789
Maw Maw, release!

10:21.855 --> 10:23.123
Why couldn't we leave
her home?

10:23.190 --> 10:24.992
Because I broke a glass
in the kitchen,

10:25.058 --> 10:27.227
and I wasn't in the mood
to clean it up.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.596
Burt and I need to get
to the judge's chambers.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.298
But after, I'd love
to tell you

10:31.364 --> 10:32.933
how you could use
your broken glass

10:33.000 --> 10:35.703
to make a lovely mosaic
for your patio.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.637
Come on.

10:39.606 --> 10:40.708
Oh, gotta hang back.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.676
You can't be near
those kids, Burt.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.844
You're a sex offender.

10:46.346 --> 10:49.182
No, uh, I'm not a perv
or anything.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.719
I just made love
with my teenage wife.

10:51.785 --> 10:55.188
It's cool! I gave him
the green light!

11:06.499 --> 11:10.103
They've been talking to
the judge a long time.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.304
Oh, man.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.505
I hope Dad didn't
get frustrated

11:12.572 --> 11:14.474
and do his crank-up-his-
middle-finger thing.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.910
Yeah, he's definitely in
a finger-cranking mood today.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.412
I got one this morning
when I got the last Eggo.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.716
Good news.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.284
They overturned
my dot.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.788
Take that, justice system.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.758
(bell dings)

11:32.292 --> 11:34.427
(children shouting)

11:35.763 --> 11:38.531
Some old lady
took her shirt off.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.168
Best field trip ever!

11:50.677 --> 11:52.045
(bell dings)

11:57.150 --> 11:59.586
Well, I talked to the judge
and explained that your Maw Maw

11:59.652 --> 12:01.955
is a teeny bit bonkadoo,

12:02.022 --> 12:03.991
he'll get rid of the
dot as soon as she

12:04.057 --> 12:06.426
does 12 hours
of community service.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.461
(laughing)

12:11.899 --> 12:13.433
12 hours?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.435
She's only awake for
three hours at a time.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.205
Well, some of those kids
were pretty shook up.

12:18.271 --> 12:21.108
Yeah. First time you see 'em,
it can be pretty rough.

12:21.174 --> 12:24.211
I still can't eat dried fruit
without heaving a little first.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.646
Well, let's see
what has a need right now.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.749
Bip, bip, bip, bip...
here we go.

12:29.817 --> 12:33.353
Picking up trash on Highway 80.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.621
She's going to have
to do that tomorrow,

12:34.687 --> 12:37.190
because the application's
due the day after.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.726
She can't even get her own
toilet paper in the toilet.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.863
How is she going to get strange
trash in a strange trash can?

12:42.930 --> 12:44.464
Well, she has to.

12:44.531 --> 12:45.765
A while back,

12:45.833 --> 12:49.469
I slipped on a wig and did
my wife's community service

12:49.536 --> 12:51.805
when she got arrested
for spousal abuse.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.874
(coughs)
Point is,

12:53.941 --> 12:57.945
that any woman can sign in
and do the job.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.984
I hate all of you.

13:04.051 --> 13:07.320
Thank you for having me
on the show, Johnny.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.525
(crickets chirping)

13:16.129 --> 13:17.998
Hey, thanks for
doing this.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.367
I packed you a lunch
of all orange things

13:20.433 --> 13:22.569
so you wouldn't have to worry
about staining your jumpsuit.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.972
It's mostly cheese puffs
and jelly beans.

13:29.542 --> 13:30.643
Dad, what are you doing?

13:30.710 --> 13:32.545
Shh. He's sleep-eating.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.347
He does it every night.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.819
You know, I'm starting to think
we should have left Hope

13:39.887 --> 13:42.089
in that dog pound
day care.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.992
She could still
be successful.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.895
Just strap her to a
blind person and call it a day.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.800
How is he not, like, 500 pounds?

13:53.867 --> 13:55.903
He sleep-exercises.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.407
(grunting):
Okay.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.009
Let's do this.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.579
You sure you don't want
to brush your hair?

14:07.747 --> 14:09.182
Oh, right.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.418
'Cause if I'm going to be
picking up beer bottles

14:11.484 --> 14:14.187
and old rubbers,
I really want to look my best.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.328
Got to pee, got to pee,
got to pee, pee, pee.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.496
Got to pee, got to pee,
got to pee. Whoo!

14:28.268 --> 14:30.337
He won't give me the key
unless I buy something.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.504
Give me some money.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.246
They don't have anything
for 26 cents.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.880
Don't you have any more money?

14:40.948 --> 14:42.282
No, that's it.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.683
Try the "take a penny,
leave a penny" jar.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.618
Oh.

14:49.856 --> 14:53.360
* *

14:53.426 --> 14:54.861
Hey, Jimmy.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.364
Hey. Hey, Dancing Dan.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.869
Nobody left a penny.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.005
Sign of the times.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.141
Hey, what are you going
to do with that?

15:10.710 --> 15:12.845
(cat meows, clattering)

15:12.912 --> 15:16.283
(panting)

15:16.349 --> 15:17.750
Hey.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.886
What in the Lord?

15:19.953 --> 15:21.521
(garbled radio transmission)

15:21.588 --> 15:23.523
(sighs)

15:23.590 --> 15:24.857
(sighs)

15:24.924 --> 15:26.693
I can't believe
you're arresting me.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.195
Watch your head.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.663
The real crime is what
those people are charging

15:30.730 --> 15:32.165
for a pack of gum in there.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.301
Mom, what's going on?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.503
We just caught your mother
relieving herself

15:36.569 --> 15:37.670
behind the gas station.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.939
She's being arrested
for indecent exposure.

15:40.007 --> 15:42.275
(bell dings)

15:44.611 --> 15:46.546
What am I supposed to do?
I need to find someone

15:46.613 --> 15:47.947
to pick up litter
in like five minutes.

15:48.015 --> 15:50.017
I got bigger problems, Jimmy.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.585
My mug shot's going
to look terrible.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.997
Excuse me, miss.
I'd like to pay you

16:04.064 --> 16:05.265
to pretend to be my
great-grandmother

16:05.332 --> 16:06.766
on the side of the road.

16:06.833 --> 16:07.967
It'll be dirty, but...

16:08.035 --> 16:10.437
(siren whooping)

16:12.805 --> 16:14.707
That hooker was wearing a wire.

16:14.774 --> 16:17.644
I heard the whole thing
on the walkie-talkie.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.412
It's like watching
your kid drown

16:19.479 --> 16:22.449
and not being able
to tell him to shut up.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.251
(bell dings)

16:32.225 --> 16:35.395
I know I've said lying's bad,
but, I mean,

16:35.462 --> 16:37.497
half the games we play are lies.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.466
Like peekaboo?

16:39.532 --> 16:41.501
I'm not really gone.
Still here.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.570
(cooing)

16:43.636 --> 16:46.306
What I'm saying is,
I think I have to use

16:46.373 --> 16:47.907
our neighbor's address
on this form,

16:47.974 --> 16:50.210
although I wish
I didn't have to.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.345
You know, I wouldn't have
to do all this

16:52.412 --> 16:55.115
if you weren't doing dog stuff
like barking or...

16:57.484 --> 16:59.419
Chewing bones?

16:59.486 --> 17:01.121
Who gave Hope a steak bone?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.624
She fetched my slippers.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.359
I keep my promises.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.929
(sighs):
Oh, man.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.631
(growls)

17:11.698 --> 17:12.565
(gasps)

17:13.766 --> 17:15.502
I got to get you away
from these dogs.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.504
Think I have to lie about more
than just our address.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.772
Excuse me.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.741
Everybody?

17:21.808 --> 17:25.145
I would like to thank
you all for applying.

17:25.212 --> 17:28.215
All of you had
such compelling stories.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.117
The O'Donnells.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.051
Both of you working three jobs

17:32.119 --> 17:34.621
while living
in another family's basement,

17:34.687 --> 17:38.024
somehow using a hot plate
to heat your bathwater.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.259
Oh, and Mr. Melman.

17:39.326 --> 17:40.893
Mr. Melman volunteers

17:40.960 --> 17:44.431
every single day
in a downtown soup kitchen.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.535
The Sanchezes had to float
to this country

17:48.601 --> 17:50.036
on an inner tube
with nothing but a stick

17:50.103 --> 17:51.704
to fight off the shark attacks.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.176
Oh, and the Hassecks,
who are functionally mute.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.348
But one story stood out.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.416
Would you come up here,
Jim Chance?

18:03.483 --> 18:06.553
Come on.
Don't be shy.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.292
James Chance,

18:12.359 --> 18:15.762
single father who gave up
a promising career in art

18:15.828 --> 18:18.231
to fight for his country
in Afghanistan,

18:18.298 --> 18:20.433
only to injure
his drawing hand

18:20.500 --> 18:22.169
while carrying several
orphans to safety.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.404
Then, when he
came back,

18:24.471 --> 18:27.006
he was carjacked by a
man desperate for money

18:27.073 --> 18:30.243
to pay for a
kidney transplant.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.079
And who do you suppose
gave him the kidney?

18:33.146 --> 18:35.014
ALL:
James Chance.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.950
The scholarship goes
to Hope Chance.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.719
Congratulations.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.688
Yeah, I-I'm sorry
to have to do this,

18:41.754 --> 18:43.756
but the "unchosen" will
have to leave now.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.525
Thank you.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.227
Just... mm-hmm.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.897
Thank you.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.332
Wait.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.568
I lied on my application.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.271
What?
I lied on my application.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.939
I didn't even want to lie,

19:00.006 --> 19:02.509
but it all started when...
when I had to fake my address

19:02.575 --> 19:03.910
because we have blue dots.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.745
We're... we're
sexual offenders.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.214
Excuse me?

19:07.280 --> 19:09.249
But it's all
a misunderstanding, right?

19:09.316 --> 19:10.650
My parents hooked up
as teenagers,

19:10.717 --> 19:13.186
my great-grandmother runs around
without her bra on,

19:13.253 --> 19:15.355
and I tried to get a favor
from a hooker.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.690
Okay, but it wasn't
a sexual favor.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.794
I really wanted to get my
daughter into this school.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.763
I'm sorry.

19:25.031 --> 19:28.235
Uh... I'm really sorry.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.339
That was very brave,
Mr. Chance.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.041
Coming clean like that,
that took courage.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.976
Really?

19:37.043 --> 19:38.378
Cool.

19:38.445 --> 19:39.479
Wait. Wait,
wait, wait.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.348
I can be brave, too.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.350
I don't really volunteer
at the soup kitchen.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.418
I have OCD--
one, two, three, four, five--

19:45.485 --> 19:47.487
and... and I think
that homeless people are filthy.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.855
One, two, three, four, five.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.157
Uh, we didn't really come here
on an inner tube.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.025
Sure, our name is Sanchez,

19:53.092 --> 19:55.962
but we're about as Latino
as the Three Amigos.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.397
Uh, we can speak.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.399
In fact, my wife here
will hardly ever shut up.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.933
And she hits me.

20:01.000 --> 20:01.901
JIMMY:
Hey.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.403
I also lied
about my kid's mother.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.637
She was a serial killer.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.072
I didn't even get into that.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.874
Yeah, my penis is tiny.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.075
Okay, uh-uh.

20:09.141 --> 20:11.210
JIMMY:
Honesty may be the best policy,

20:11.278 --> 20:13.980
but in this case,
it got us all disqualified.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.181
It also gave me a chance

20:15.248 --> 20:17.250
to tell everyone
about Shelley's day care,

20:17.317 --> 20:19.586
and honestly,
I couldn't be happier.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.389
Wow, Jimmy.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.693
Thanks for telling so many
people about my school.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.261
This place is great.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.330
It just needed
more kids.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.931
Okay, everybody,

20:31.998 --> 20:34.567
I think we're ready to
sing the welcome song.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.739
* Yesterday I was so lonely *

20:39.806 --> 20:41.808
* Nothing but Kibbles 'n Bits *

20:41.874 --> 20:44.577
* Just me and the dogs,
they chewed up my clogs *

20:44.644 --> 20:47.747
* And one had a case of the... *

20:47.814 --> 20:49.081
* Poopies *

20:49.148 --> 20:51.584
* But today I made *

20:51.651 --> 20:54.321
* New best friends,
new best friends *

20:54.387 --> 20:56.989
* It's only been a minute,
but we're new best friends *

20:57.056 --> 20:59.859
* Sisters and bros,
nuevo amigos *

20:59.926 --> 21:02.329
* Sharing our secrets
till every day ends *

21:02.395 --> 21:03.863
Everybody!

21:03.930 --> 21:06.733
* New best friends,
new best friends *

21:06.799 --> 21:09.369
* We just met this morning,
but we're new best friends *

21:09.436 --> 21:11.904
* Sisters and bros,
nuevo amigos *

21:11.971 --> 21:14.641
* Sharing our secrets
till every day ends *
(doorbell rings)

21:14.707 --> 21:17.344
* New best friends... *

21:17.410 --> 21:19.011
We're the Chances.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.347
We're all sex offenders

21:20.413 --> 21:21.614
