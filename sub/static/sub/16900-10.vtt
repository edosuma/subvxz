00:08.050 --> 00:10.427
The flowers are lovely.
Thank you.

00:10.594 --> 00:13.055
No, you hang up first.

00:13.222 --> 00:14.389
Okay, on the count of three.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.850
One, two, three...

00:17.017 --> 00:19.353
No, I didn't hang up either.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.980
Donaghy, I need your help.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.191
I miss you too.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.859
I said I miss you too.
You're breaking up.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.520
Maureen?
She cut out.

00:28.693 --> 00:31.361
I need $60,000,
or I'm gonna lose my house.

00:31.537 --> 00:33.323
Which house?

00:33.499 --> 00:36.622
I need $100,000,
or I'm gonna lose both my houses!

00:36.789 --> 00:37.661
Tracy, I don't understand.

00:37.825 --> 00:40.993
You've starred in 14 films.
You don't have any money saved?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.580
Nah, I lost all of it.

00:42.756 --> 00:44.212
Really?
Who's your money manager?

00:44.375 --> 00:45.751
Grizz.

00:45.925 --> 00:48.461
Worldcom, man.
Worldcom.

00:48.638 --> 00:51.260
Look, Tracy,
I can't just give you money.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.721
But what I can do is show you
how you can earn all the money you need.

00:54.885 --> 00:56.053
You must know Arsenio.
Hall or Billingham?

00:56.226 --> 00:56.092
You know someone
named Arsenio Billingham?

00:56.265 --> 00:57.473
Put his name
and face on a product.

00:57.645 --> 01:01.271
Because of Arsenio's "woof-woof" catchphrase,
we settled on dog food.

01:01.437 --> 01:06.101
The product was a runaway success.
The company and Arsenio made millions.

01:06.276 --> 01:10.440
I like that.
Put my name on something.

01:10.616 --> 01:12.190
But what would I sell?

01:12.366 --> 01:13.861
The product is irrelevant.

01:14.036 --> 01:16.030
The people aren't buying that.
They're buying you.

01:16.208 --> 01:18.702
Now, you come back with an idea
of a product you'd be willing to sell,

01:18.878 --> 01:24.710
anything at all, and you'll have
all the money you can dream of.

01:25.468 --> 01:27.792
I'm on it.

01:27.968 --> 01:29.252
I forgot about that Worldcom mess.

01:29.425 --> 01:31.842
Why you gotta be so obsessed
with telecommunications?

01:32.006 --> 01:36.760
Get me Maureen Dowd
back on the phone, please.

01:59.667 --> 02:01.281
Hey, I've got to miss
an hour of rehearsal today

02:01.455 --> 02:04.410
because I just found out from my publicist
I've been booked on The View.

02:04.586 --> 02:05.700
Oh, Jenna, that's great.

02:05.875 --> 02:06.583
For the first time in your life,

02:06.756 --> 02:09.580
you'll be in a room full of women
and you'll be the least crazy one.

02:09.756 --> 02:10.919
I know.

02:11.086 --> 02:12.040
(Liz) Oh, you know
what clip you should show?

02:12.217 --> 02:13.251
"MTV: Darfur."

02:13.427 --> 02:15.053
You and Tracy
were really funny in that.

02:15.215 --> 02:18.131
Oh, this isn't for TGS.
It's for my movie.

02:18.308 --> 02:20.761
The Rurr-Jurr has
a limited release next week.

02:20.936 --> 02:21.762
Oh, congratulations!

02:21.936 --> 02:24.433
I didn't know they had
a release date for The Rurr--

02:24.605 --> 02:26.141
For that movie.

02:26.318 --> 02:29.061
Oh, sorry.
Gotta take this.

02:29.237 --> 02:29.813
Hello?

02:29.988 --> 02:30.853
You still don't know
what the title is?

02:31.027 --> 02:31.901
No! No one does.

02:32.066 --> 02:35.901
It's gone on way too long
to ask her about it.

02:36.075 --> 02:37.611
This title isn't hard
to understand, right?

02:37.787 --> 02:39.662
No, it's awesome!

02:39.826 --> 02:43.123
I love that we can work
while we're on cocaine!

02:43.287 --> 02:45.741
Could it be Roar Her,
Gem Her?

02:45.918 --> 02:48.660
No, that doesn't make any sense.
It's got to be Oral Germ Whore.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.750
Okay, bye.

02:50.928 --> 02:52.710
Sorry, that was my publicist.

02:52.885 --> 02:54.211
You know, I have to admit,

02:54.387 --> 02:58.551
I kind of like that Tracy Jordan is no longer
the only movie star on TGS.

02:58.727 --> 03:01.051
Maybe I'll finally start getting
some respect around here.

03:01.225 --> 03:04.183
What's up, flabby butt?
You look weird today.

03:04.356 --> 03:07.353
Hey, Pete, you wanna see a comic book
with pregnant zombie nuns?

03:07.525 --> 03:09.020
Yes, I do.

03:09.185 --> 03:11.101
Cool.

03:11.277 --> 03:12.941
And I have a screener
of the movie for you.

03:13.116 --> 03:15.903
I want you to watch it.

03:16.075 --> 03:20.400
Ah, The Rural Juror!
That is something.

03:21.915 --> 03:22.913
I can't wait to watch it.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.990
Oh, you won't be disappointed.
The source material was amazing.

03:26.168 --> 03:28.041
It's hard to go wrong
with a Kevin Grisham novel.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.830
- You mean John Grisham.
- Oh, no.

03:30.007 --> 03:31.543
Kevin, John's brother.

03:31.717 --> 03:35.841
Did you know that before Kevin was a novelist,
he worked at a recycling center?

03:36.007 --> 03:36.753
W ow.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.590
Yeah, and he just finished
writing a sequel.

03:38.765 --> 03:40.672
It's called Urban Fervor.

03:40.845 --> 03:45.143
Boy, these titles--
They really make you think.

03:45.306 --> 03:47.430
Oh, wow!

03:47.605 --> 03:51.063
Doesn't it seem like just yesterday
we were doing the show back in Chicago,

03:51.237 --> 03:52.981
dreaming about being in the movies?

03:53.155 --> 03:55.941
We've come a long way
from that apartment we shared
in Little Armenia.

03:56.116 --> 03:58.073
Oh, it was so weird there.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.823
You remember that neighborhood festival
where they killed a goat in the street?

04:00.998 --> 04:02.151
Yes!

04:02.325 --> 04:03.823
But we did have really
good luck that year.

04:03.997 --> 04:06.282
Yeah.

04:07.457 --> 04:10.583
I need to come up with a big idea
for a product to put my name on.

04:10.756 --> 04:13.672
Something no one has thought of.
Something crazy.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.291
I know a gentleman
who had a lot of crazy ideas.

04:16.466 --> 04:19.212
He was a carpenter.
He wanted everyone to love one another.

04:19.386 --> 04:20.382
Oh, you mean Jesus?

04:20.558 --> 04:25.260
No-- Miguel from set design.
He's over there.

04:31.685 --> 04:34.141
Eurek-o!

04:41.248 --> 04:41.442
Hey.

04:41.616 --> 04:43.703
What are you doing back here?
They're rehearsing your Paris Hilton sketch.

04:43.866 --> 04:46.742
I'm trying to avoid Jenna.
She gave me a screener of her movie.

04:46.918 --> 04:47.571
And?

04:47.748 --> 04:51.540
Oh, Pete, it's awful!
I couldn't believe how bad it was.

04:51.705 --> 04:55.871
Although, I guess it's no surprise that
Tony Hawk can't play blind.

04:56.047 --> 04:57.173
So you must know the title!

04:57.336 --> 04:59.920
Yes, yes-- The Rural Juror.

05:00.097 --> 05:01.132
- The Rrr--
- Rural.

05:01.306 --> 05:02.093
- The Ruh--
- Rural.

05:02.267 --> 05:02.920
Eh.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.680
(Pete) So, what are you gonna
do about Jenna?

05:04.848 --> 05:06.842
(Liz) Same thing I've always done
when she's done something terrible.

05:07.015 --> 05:11.893
Think of one thing nice to say
and then hug her.

05:13.185 --> 05:14.351
So, what did you think?

05:14.527 --> 05:15.391
Oh, my God!

05:15.568 --> 05:18.983
You looked so beautiful.

05:23.826 --> 05:27.573
The lighting was really neat.

05:31.588 --> 05:36.673
Ethan and I both thought
the programs were really easy to read.

05:36.835 --> 05:39.501
So, what nice thing are you going to say
about The Roaring Junior?

05:39.675 --> 05:43.302
Uh, I don't know.
It's a mess.

05:43.467 --> 05:45.301
No, you've got to tell them
that when Paris Hilton

05:45.477 --> 05:47.841
tries to make out with the bear, 
the bear has to act like he's into it.

05:48.016 --> 05:50.600
All right.

05:51.898 --> 05:55.930
Mr. Donaghy, stop what you're doing
because I'm about to blow your mind!

05:56.105 --> 05:58.521
Hit it!

05:59.066 --> 06:00.860
Tired of your sandwich making you angry?

06:01.026 --> 06:04.990
Then behold the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine!

06:05.158 --> 06:06.862
Stick  any three meats--

06:07.037 --> 06:08.031
Whatever you want!

06:08.205 --> 06:10.741
Bologna, salami, boar--

06:10.915 --> 06:11.990
Whatever!

06:12.165 --> 06:15.792
Into  this sexy lady
and she will melt them all together

06:15.955 --> 06:17.250
into one delicious food ball.

06:17.417 --> 06:20.583
Never again will you have to suffer
through the bread part of your sandwich.

06:20.806 --> 06:25.212
I give you the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine!

06:25.388 --> 06:29.550
(all) Meat is the new bread! Uh-huh!

06:30.306 --> 06:31.930
What do you think?

06:32.107 --> 06:35.931
Well, it's certainly not the worst
celebrity product idea I've ever heard.

06:36.106 --> 06:37.433
Hi, I'm Whoopi Goldberg.

06:37.605 --> 06:41.691
And you're Working Out
With Whoopi.

06:42.116 --> 06:44.821
With Tracy Jordan behind this,
it just might work.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.191
We'll roll it out in time for Christmas.

06:46.366 --> 06:49.282
Manufacture it for four bucks,
slap your name on it, and sell it for 50.

06:49.456 --> 06:51.820
So GE will produce
the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine?

06:51.993 --> 06:53.581
Oh, no. No.

06:53.747 --> 06:58.293
GE could never make something so, um...
Unique.

06:58.469 --> 07:02.842
We'll have to pass this off
to one of our subsidiaries.

07:03.009 --> 07:08.052
You see, GE owns KitchenAll of Colorado,
which, in turn, owns JMI of Stanford,

07:08.225 --> 07:10.762
which is a majority shareholder
in Pokerfastlane.com,

07:10.937 --> 07:12.933
which recently acquired
the Sheinhardt Wig Company,

07:13.106 --> 07:14.260
which owns NBC outright.

07:14.435 --> 07:18.311
NBC owns Winnipeg Iron Works
which owns the Ahp Chanagi Party Meats corporation

07:18.485 --> 07:19.942
of Pyongyang, North Korea.

07:20.105 --> 07:24.273
And they will make the Meat Machine.

07:26.908 --> 07:29.323
Jack Donaghy,
you are the best.

07:29.497 --> 07:30.451
(Tracy) You know what?

07:30.616 --> 07:34.073
I'm gonna make you a mix tape.
You like Phil Collins?

07:34.248 --> 07:36.870
I've got two ears and a heart, don't I?

07:37.046 --> 07:38.290
All right, Jenna's on next.

07:38.455 --> 07:41.922
Everyone shut up so we can hear the title
of this stupid movie.

07:42.088 --> 07:44.791
And coming up,
I'll be talking to The Girlie Show star

07:44.965 --> 07:49.801
Jenna Maroney about her upcoming project,
The Rrr-Jrr.

07:49.977 --> 07:52.842
That is not helpful.

07:53.017 --> 07:54.763
Hey, do you know the name
of Jenna's movie yet?

07:54.936 --> 07:56.562
Oh, yeah, she gave me a screener.

07:56.728 --> 07:57.813
- Okay!
- No, no, no--

07:57.977 --> 07:59.312
I'm not telling you
anything about it.

07:59.478 --> 08:01.812
I'm not giving you more ammunition
to make fun of her with.

08:01.988 --> 08:03.650
So it's bad.

08:03.818 --> 08:05.652
How bad?

08:05.818 --> 08:08.151
Please!
Just give us one detail.

08:08.328 --> 08:09.322
Okay, fine.

08:09.486 --> 08:14.741
Jenna plays a southern lawyer
named Constance Justice.

08:16.708 --> 08:17.830
You gotta let us see this.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.292
- No!
- Come on, Liz!

08:19.455 --> 08:20.122
No!

08:20.296 --> 08:21.332
Oh, man.

08:21.506 --> 08:23.332
Constance Justice.

08:23.507 --> 08:25.542
Justice has been served.
Good stuff.

08:25.717 --> 08:29.462
Tracy to the stage please for
Pull Your Own Wisdom Teeth.

08:29.635 --> 08:30.213
(Jenna) Oh, excuse me.

08:30.388 --> 08:32.169
Hey, there you are.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.182
So, what did you think of the movie?

08:34.347 --> 08:35.302
Oh, my God, Jenna!

08:35.476 --> 08:39.142
The soundtrack was so moody.

08:39.855 --> 08:41.352
What else did you like about it?

08:41.528 --> 08:44.192
What? Oh, um...
You were good!

08:44.358 --> 08:50.481
Your face was very expressive.
And another cool part was...the trees.

08:53.155 --> 08:54.821
I gotta get back to work.

08:54.997 --> 08:56.201
You didn't like the movie.

08:56.378 --> 08:58.530
What?
Yes, I just said I like the movie.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.622
No, you didn't.

08:59.796 --> 09:02.293
You did that condescending
compliment thing you always do.

09:02.457 --> 09:06.292
What? When have
I ever done that?

09:06.465 --> 09:08.342
So, what did you think?

09:08.508 --> 09:12.590
Oh, my God...
You looked beautiful.

09:15.596 --> 09:18.970
The lighting was really neat.

09:19.145 --> 09:24.313
Ethan and I both thought
the programs were really easy to read.

09:24.485 --> 09:26.813
Well, that's not how
I remember any of that.

09:26.985 --> 09:28.443
Look, Liz,
for once, be honest with me.

09:28.617 --> 09:30.273
I want your real opinion.

09:30.448 --> 09:34.031
Okay, I thought the story
was preposterous.

09:34.195 --> 09:35.863
I thought the acting
was way over the top.

09:36.035 --> 09:38.243
And I thought it was about
an hour too long.

09:38.418 --> 09:40.160
It's only 90 minutes.

09:40.337 --> 09:41.741
It's kind of a train wreck.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.410
A train wreck? Okay.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.212
I'm not trying to be a jerk here.
You asked me for my opinion.

09:47.378 --> 09:51.340
No,  no--
I understand.
Thank you.

09:51.717 --> 09:54.513
I wasn't kidding about how cool
those trees were, though.

09:54.678 --> 09:57.931
What were they? Oaks?

09:58.435 --> 10:02.313
Damn it!
Where are my car keys?

10:02.765 --> 10:05.273
Jack, Tracy--
What can I do for you?

10:05.435 --> 10:07.943
Leo, we have a product
we want you to give a medical endorsement to.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.111
I'll do it!
What is it?

10:10.275 --> 10:13.403
It's called the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine.

10:13.576 --> 10:14.862
It's a dual-press grill.

10:15.036 --> 10:15.942
Say no more.

10:16.117 --> 10:18.663
If it's giving people meat,
then I'm onboard.

10:18.828 --> 10:22.123
I've always said
humans need more animal blood.

10:22.287 --> 10:23.873
It keeps the spine straight.

10:24.045 --> 10:25.001
We appreciate it, Leo.

10:25.165 --> 10:26.620
You boys need anything
while you're here?

10:26.797 --> 10:28.751
Some reds, yellows...

10:28.926 --> 10:30.541
Just got some purples in from Peru.

10:30.718 --> 10:31.502
No, I'm good.

10:31.676 --> 10:34.301
Well, it would be rude not to take, uh...

10:34.467 --> 10:37.093
One or two.

10:37.267 --> 10:40.971
Now, The Rrr Jrr
is the true story of Rory Jerner,

10:41.148 --> 10:45.182
whose pure furor
ensures a terrible murder--

10:45.356 --> 10:47.942
Excuse me.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.272
I feel like I'm getting
further away from it.

10:51.446 --> 10:53.981
Hey, last night
I broke into Liz's office.

10:54.156 --> 10:55.032
I got Jenna's movie.

10:55.197 --> 10:56.362
Oh, how'd you get in there?

10:56.537 --> 10:58.450
That weird security guard
Tony let me in.

10:58.618 --> 11:00.280
I also looked on Liz's computer.

11:00.456 --> 11:05.372
Her last two Google searches
were for singles yoga and scalp pain.

11:05.547 --> 11:08.330
That is grim.

11:10.375 --> 11:12.131
The Rural Juror?

11:12.295 --> 11:13.882
Man, that's disappointing.

11:14.048 --> 11:18.170
I had to let Tony watch me pee
to get that tape.

11:18.347 --> 11:20.263
What?

11:20.438 --> 11:22.141
Hey, you wanted to see me?

11:22.308 --> 11:24.562
Yeah, I don't want to wear
this Paris Hilton nose.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.182
(Liz) I'm sorry.
You have to wear the nose.

11:26.358 --> 11:28.642
There's a whole bunch of jokes
in the sketch about the nose.

11:28.818 --> 11:33.231
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I think the entire sketch is a train wreck.

11:33.408 --> 11:34.440
Oh, I see.

11:34.618 --> 11:36.113
We're not talking about the nose.

11:36.285 --> 11:37.863
We're talking about the movie.

11:38.035 --> 11:41.823
You're wrong about it, Liz.
It's getting some very positive early reviews.

11:41.995 --> 11:44.783
Teenmoviescene.com gave it five out of five iPods.

11:44.957 --> 11:48.831
Jenna, believe what you want.
I'm your friend. I'm telling you the truth.

11:49.005 --> 11:49.830
Please--

11:50.007 --> 11:52.083
Here's what's really going on.

11:52.255 --> 11:55.423
It's killing you that
I'm in something good
that you had nothing to do with.

11:55.598 --> 11:56.712
And now you're taking it out on me.

11:56.885 --> 11:57.752
Oh, come on!

11:57.928 --> 11:59.463
Well, enjoy kicking me around for now, Liz.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.130
Because I won't be on your crappy
little show forever.

12:02.307 --> 12:03.841
Really?

12:04.015 --> 12:04.891
Really.

12:05.058 --> 12:05.722
Really?

12:05.896 --> 12:06.683
Really. 

12:06.858 --> 12:08.222
Really?

12:08.396 --> 12:09.890
Really.

12:10.068 --> 12:14.520
Well, Jenna,
I'm sorry you feel that way.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.481
Ow! What the hell?

12:16.657 --> 12:17.441
Oh, God, I'm sorry!

12:17.615 --> 12:22.110
I didn't know
there was a person in there!

12:24.285 --> 12:28.161
Pete, could you tell Liz Lemon
not to stand in my eyeline
while I'm rehearsing, please?

12:28.336 --> 12:33.422
Pete, could you tell Jenna
she smells like a stripper?

12:33.588 --> 12:34.462
So,  uh...

12:34.636 --> 12:35.880
Are you guys still fighting?

12:36.045 --> 12:37.751
We've reached kind of an understanding.

12:37.927 --> 12:39.053
She's not talking to me.

12:39.307 --> 12:42.422
And to retaliate,
I'm writing impressions for her
that she can't do.

12:42.598 --> 12:47.012
I did not have sexual relations
with that woman.

12:47.188 --> 12:50.102
You guys can't go on like this.
You have to apologize to her.

12:50.278 --> 12:51.143
I didn't do anything wrong!

12:51.316 --> 12:54.311
She insisted on me telling her
what I thought of her crappy movie.

12:54.486 --> 12:55.402
And then she attacked me.

12:55.568 --> 12:59.441
Liz, I can't have the head writer
and one of the stars of the show fighting.

12:59.618 --> 13:06.570
I can barely keep a lid on the feud
going on between Kenneth and Dougie from props.

13:13.836 --> 13:20.462
Audience, let me ask you a question.
How many times has this happened to you?

13:22.347 --> 13:24.802
Or this:

13:26.015 --> 13:27.853
Seem familiar?

13:28.015 --> 13:30.641
Bread is one of the worst
things in the world.

13:30.815 --> 13:32.180
But we've always needed it.

13:32.356 --> 13:33.600
Until now!

13:33.777 --> 13:37.650
By burning three different types of meat together,
The Tracy Jordan Meat Machine

13:37.815 --> 13:40.481
takes bread out of the equation!

13:40.657 --> 13:45.243
Now your sandwich is
all of the good stuff.

13:46.866 --> 13:50.372
That's delicious!
And it's healthy.

13:50.535 --> 13:52.491
Hi, I'm Doctor Leo Spaceman.

13:52.668 --> 13:57.290
I'm a working physician with a degree
from the Ho Chi Minh City School of Medicine.

13:57.467 --> 14:00.923
Doctor Space-man,
is it true that bread eats away at your brain?

14:01.095 --> 14:07.553
We have no way of knowing
because the powerful bread lobby
keeps stopping my research!

14:07.727 --> 14:08.683
Well, folks,

14:08.848 --> 14:11.430
bread will never maybe
attack your brain again!

14:11.608 --> 14:13.603
Because with the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine--

14:13.778 --> 14:14.773
Say it with me now!

14:14.938 --> 14:18.602
(all) Meat is the new bread!

14:25.407 --> 14:26.901
Where did you guys get this tape?

14:27.076 --> 14:29.112
Oh, Josh broke into your office.

14:29.288 --> 14:31.283
You went in my office
without permission?

14:31.455 --> 14:33.123
Because I'm worried
about your scalp pain.

14:33.298 --> 14:35.041
Hello, everyone.

14:35.205 --> 14:36.123
Frank, could you tell Liz--

14:36.295 --> 14:39.543
Nope, not interested.

14:39.715 --> 14:41.711
Girl writer, could you tell Liz
that I don't--

14:41.887 --> 14:43.171
Jenna, stop this.
It's stupid.

14:43.348 --> 14:44.630
Let's just go in my office and talk.

14:44.806 --> 14:46.012
Oh, there is nothing to talk about.

14:46.175 --> 14:47.423
Stop making this something it isn't.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.473
I just didn't like the movie
because it's bad.

14:50.647 --> 14:53.350
These guys watched it.
They'll tell you.

14:53.516 --> 14:54.720
Actually, we all kind of liked it.

14:54.898 --> 14:55.931
What? No, you didn't.

14:56.106 --> 14:57.180
Yeah, we all did.

14:57.357 --> 15:01.401
It's not the best thing in the world,
but it's solid and Jenna's really good in it.

15:01.565 --> 15:03.111
Thank you, Frank.

15:03.276 --> 15:04.110
Look! Look at her!

15:04.278 --> 15:05.690
She can't stand
that I'm in something good.

15:05.866 --> 15:08.570
It's probably because
of her own intellectual insecurities.

15:08.747 --> 15:10.163
What? Frank, shut up.

15:10.327 --> 15:10.953
Fine, dismiss me.

15:11.116 --> 15:13.740
I guess because I look weird,
I can't be perceptive.

15:13.916 --> 15:15.871
I can't believe
you like this movie!

15:16.047 --> 15:18.212
Oh!

15:20.176 --> 15:22.580
Jeez, I hope those two work it out.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.841
Relax, man.

15:24.005 --> 15:26.763
As long as they're yapping at each other,
we're not working.

15:26.925 --> 15:27.923
Enjoy it.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.513
I want these everywhere!

15:29.685 --> 15:35.560
I want every person here
eating from a Tracy Jordan Meat Machine.

15:36.015 --> 15:36.973
Ow, ah!

15:37.148 --> 15:39.231
Cheese and crackers,
that smarts!

15:39.398 --> 15:40.272
What happened?

15:40.448 --> 15:42.350
The grease burned me, Mr. Jordan.

15:42.528 --> 15:43.943
The machine must be broken.

15:44.115 --> 15:47.731
That one must be defective.

15:48.118 --> 15:52.030
Oh, ow! My face!
My page jacket!

15:52.245 --> 15:56.870
They all must be like that!
Where's Donaghy?

15:58.508 --> 16:00.080
Can somebody
take me to a hospital?

16:00.255 --> 16:02.330
Jenna, stop.
I just want to get past this.

16:02.506 --> 16:04.131
What do you need me to do?

16:04.297 --> 16:06.420
Well, you can start
by saying you're sorry.

16:06.595 --> 16:08.550
To--
Fine.

16:08.715 --> 16:13.971
I am sorry that I assumed other people
would hate the movie just because I hate it.

16:14.147 --> 16:14.851
That was wrong.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.222
That's it?
That's your apology?

16:16.395 --> 16:17.851
Yeah. Are we good?

16:18.028 --> 16:19.470
- We're good.
- Great.

16:19.648 --> 16:21.100
So, do I have to wear the nose tonight?

16:21.276 --> 16:21.850
Yes, you do.

16:22.027 --> 16:24.860
Okay, well then
I hope you get bird flu and die.

16:25.026 --> 16:25.810
What did you just say to me?

16:25.988 --> 16:27.983
You are a big fake,
you know that, Liz?

16:28.156 --> 16:29.862
She doesn't even need those glasses.

16:30.037 --> 16:33.613
Really, I'm a fake, blondie?
I'm a fake?

16:33.785 --> 16:37.491
Burning jets of grease, huh?
Were any of our people hurt?

16:37.665 --> 16:39.331
- Only Kenneth.
- Good.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.292
What are we gonna do?
We can't sell this.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.172
You're right,
we can't sell this...

16:44.335 --> 16:45.793
in the United States.

16:45.968 --> 16:46.543
What?

16:46.718 --> 16:49.380
We simply have to find a market
with lax safety regulations.

16:49.558 --> 16:51.511
With your international appeal,
we can go anywhere.

16:51.675 --> 16:52.550
How about the Ukraine?

16:52.726 --> 16:53.512
Not the Ukraine.

16:53.686 --> 16:55.552
I own some property
on the Dnieper River.

16:55.726 --> 16:56.433
In Volyn?

16:56.607 --> 16:58.063
Closer to Cherkasy.

16:58.228 --> 17:00.772
Well, we'll find another country then.
How do you feel about Venezuela?

17:00.935 --> 17:02.233
Can't do it, Donaghy.

17:02.398 --> 17:05.652
I can't put my name on a product
that's gonna hurt people.

17:05.817 --> 17:06.772
That's disappointing.

17:06.946 --> 17:09.651
Although I admire your integrity.

17:09.827 --> 17:11.992
Mr. Donaghy,
they need you on stage immediately.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.282
Some kind of emergency.

17:13.457 --> 17:16.661
For crying out loud.

17:17.127 --> 17:20.541
I'm sorry that we're not
all weeping with gratitude
at getting to read your words.

17:20.707 --> 17:25.042
I am so glad 
I studied voice at Northwestern
so I could do raps about Suri Cruise.

17:25.214 --> 17:25.671
Oh, please!

17:25.835 --> 17:27.251
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be slutting it up

17:27.426 --> 17:29.712
for car dealership owners
so they'd put you in their commercial.

17:29.888 --> 17:31.760
Oh, so now I'm a slut? Yeah.

17:31.925 --> 17:32.711
Let me tell you something.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.550
This slut slept with your brother!

17:34.727 --> 17:35.263
Mitch?

17:35.435 --> 17:36.800
Yeah,  and let me tell you
something about Mitch.

17:36.975 --> 17:38.850
He is disgusting in bed.

17:39.017 --> 17:42.353
You know he's not right.
He was in a really bad skiing accident!

17:42.527 --> 17:44.940
Ladies.

17:52.487 --> 17:55.030
Sit down.

17:58.108 --> 17:58.953
Now, what is this about?

17:59.125 --> 18:01.203
It's about my movie,
The Rrr Jrr.

18:01.375 --> 18:04.751
They've adapted The Rural Juror?
I'm a huge Kevin Grisham fan.

18:04.915 --> 18:07.252
Jenna has taken the fact
that I don't like her movie

18:07.426 --> 18:09.463
and blown it completely out of proportion.

18:09.636 --> 18:11.342
She twisted my boob.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.512
Liz, you wanted the movie to be bad.
You wanted me to fail.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.301
Okay, let me tell you something, Jenna.
Liz has always supported you.

18:17.475 --> 18:19.053
Even when I wanted you out of here,
she wouldn't give in.

18:19.225 --> 18:20.551
I've never seen her so worked up.

18:20.727 --> 18:22.681
She came at me with that
angry little badger face of hers--

18:22.857 --> 18:24.183
There it is right now.

18:24.356 --> 18:25.772
The point is,
she went to the mat for you.

18:25.937 --> 18:26.642
And she was right.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.102
- I know, but--
- But nothing.

18:28.278 --> 18:29.773
Now you're accusing Liz
of undermining you?

18:29.948 --> 18:32.693
They did warn me those diet pills
were mood altering.

18:32.868 --> 18:33.320
Yeah?

18:33.488 --> 18:35.322
I think you owe her an apology.

18:35.497 --> 18:38.740
Oh, Liz...
I'm sorry.

18:40.668 --> 18:43.702
No, don't be.
You're right.

18:43.875 --> 18:45.500
I did want the movie to be bad.

18:45.668 --> 18:46.040
Wow.

18:46.215 --> 18:49.171
The one time I try to take your side, Lemon,
and you sandbag me.

18:49.336 --> 18:50.172
I'm sorry, Jenna.

18:50.336 --> 18:52.711
I smelled crazy in here
and I assumed it was you.

18:52.885 --> 18:54.343
God, Liz, I mean--

18:54.516 --> 18:56.592
I wish you had written my movie too.

18:56.768 --> 18:59.340
No, it's not that.
It's just--

18:59.516 --> 19:02.602
The dream that we had in Chicago of getting famous--

19:02.767 --> 19:03.853
We had it.

19:04.015 --> 19:05.681
It was my dream too, Jenna.

19:05.855 --> 19:09.443
Yeah, but you couldn't have been serious
about acting for a living.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.521
You have brown hair.

19:11.695 --> 19:13.401
Look, I like what I do now.

19:13.577 --> 19:17.691
But there's still this sad little part of me
that wants to be the center of attention.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.701
That wants to get my hair done
and get free clothes.

19:20.866 --> 19:24.660
That wants to be you,
I guess.

19:25.547 --> 19:28.333
And your movie just brought
all that stuff up again.

19:28.505 --> 19:30.083
This is boring.
I'm bored now.

19:30.258 --> 19:33.173
Oh, God, Liz.
I had no idea.

19:33.348 --> 19:34.881
I'm sorry.
I'm a jackass.

19:35.055 --> 19:37.463
No, I'm sorry.

19:37.637 --> 19:39.341
So you really think I'm beautiful?

19:39.518 --> 19:41.722
I never said that.

19:41.898 --> 19:44.722
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:46.778 --> 19:48.773
Tell me (in russian): Feed me, Whoopi!

19:48.936 --> 19:51.732
(all) Whoopi!

19:54.695 --> 19:56.191
What's this?

19:56.366 --> 19:58.070
I gave the Meat Machine to Whoopi.

19:58.246 --> 20:01.610
Goldberg or Billingham?

20:09.378 --> 20:12.922
Looks like Whoopi's made herself
another billion grivka.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.671
Food ball?

20:17.428 --> 20:18.920
Let's get personal.

20:19.095 --> 20:22.763
Your father Werner was a burger server
in suburban Santa Barbara...

20:22.935 --> 20:23.972
Yes, that's right.

20:24.145 --> 20:29.101
When he spurned your mother Verna
for a curly-haired server named Roberta,
