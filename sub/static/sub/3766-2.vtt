LORI:
So you said at the station.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.077
Hey, you came to see me.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.512
Yeah, to try and talk
some sense into you.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.281
Why?

00:13.314 --> 00:15.749
It's a dangerous job
and you know it.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.085
This is Middleton!

00:17.118 --> 00:18.719
Yeah, well, tell that to Dad.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.154
He died doing what he loved.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.224
I'm sorry,

00:23.257 --> 00:24.958
I just can't give you
my blessing.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.262

-What are you doing?
-Cooking.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.175
(CHUCKLES) You don't cook.

00:41.209 --> 00:44.745
That was in New York.
In Middleton, I cook!

00:44.778 --> 00:46.980
Another reason I'm so happy
about being here.

00:48.216 --> 00:51.085
I am more than capable
of making pasta.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.254
We could be doing
this together.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.955

00:59.360 --> 01:00.528
You want some?

01:00.561 --> 01:01.795

01:03.697 --> 01:04.765

01:08.869 --> 01:10.271
Cassie?

01:10.304 --> 01:11.639
I did nothing wrong.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.642
You never do, do you, Dad?

Whatever that crust did
to you, I'm sure it's sorry.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.556
Ha! It's not the crust,
it's Sam.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.091
Our egotistical,
self-centered,

01:31.892 --> 01:34.528
arrogant doctor of a neighbor!

01:34.562 --> 01:36.497
You're not the only person
in this family who's upset.

01:37.498 --> 01:38.499
Brandon.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.237
Listen, Lori I get.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.439
Okay, she hated that
Dad was a police officer.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.974
She did.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.376
Yeah, I wasn't that
crazy about it either.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.412
No kid wants their
parent in a job

01:51.445 --> 01:53.647
where being shot at is
in the job description.

01:55.082 --> 01:56.917
But you understood
why Dad did what he did.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.888
Protecting people,

02:00.921 --> 02:02.089
that was his gift, right?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.793
So, why won't you support
Brandon's decision?

02:07.295 --> 02:08.896
I don't think
it's his decision.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.865
BRANDON: It is my decision.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.402
And if my own family
can't see that...

02:15.536 --> 02:18.239
Well, it doesn't matter
what you guys think,

02:18.272 --> 02:19.873
it's my life.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.779
Dad would hate
to see us all like this.

Hi, Sam!

02:54.208 --> 02:56.377
Hi! Uh, George let me in.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.613
For you.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.416
Coffee? You?

03:02.450 --> 03:04.585
-It's not hemlock, is it?
-Only one way to find out.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.258
That's good coffee.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.392
That's really good.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.094
It's not coffee.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.898
It's dandelion, chicory
and beet roots.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.270
I am not drinking
dandelion root.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.538
But you just did,
and you liked it.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.973
What do you have
against coffee?

03:26.006 --> 03:27.040
Probably the same thing

03:27.074 --> 03:29.142
you have against
alternative medicine.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.979
New things are always
a bit unsettling at first.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.983
You're here to apologize,
aren't you?

03:36.016 --> 03:38.085

how you seem

03:38.118 --> 03:40.053
to know everything
before it happens.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.490
Yes.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.824
Accepted.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.927
Yes, I want to apologize,

03:46.960 --> 03:48.629
but I'm not wrong.

03:48.662 --> 03:51.532
So you're sorry
you're not wrong?

03:51.565 --> 03:54.402
Yes! I am.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.504
I know there's something wrong
with George and I know

03:56.537 --> 03:59.072
whatever concoctions you
have him on aren't working.

worked for thousands of years.

-But not for George.
-I'm not the enemy.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.681
No. Whatever's wrong
with George is.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.083
If I could just get him in
the office for a few tests...

04:12.252 --> 04:14.655
How do I do that,
get him in the office?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.890
Well, um,
don't apologize to him.

Hmm.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.445
Too scared to try new things?

22:58.478 --> 23:00.947
(SCOFFS) Maybe I like
my aspirin in a bottle.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.683
It's not new, by the way,
acetylsalicylic acid.

23:03.716 --> 23:04.851
Uh, excuse me?

23:04.884 --> 23:07.887
Hippocrates swore by it,
but what does he know, right?

23:16.496 --> 23:19.265
So, I got George in my office.

23:19.298 --> 23:20.767
Seized an opportunity,
did you?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.201
(SCOFFS) Yeah, I did.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.703
-And?
-Nothing.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.005
Maybe there's nothing to find.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.608
-You don't believe that.
-No, I don't.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.444
But I'm completely stumped!

23:31.478 --> 23:32.845
And I hate being stumped.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.447
Well, maybe when
your head clears,

23:34.481 --> 23:36.649
your vision will clear, too.

23:37.850 --> 23:38.885
What are you saying?

23:39.452 --> 23:40.620
I just said it.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.889
You didn't say anything.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.657
But I did.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.161
(SIGHS)

23:50.630 --> 23:53.432
I must say I'm very surprised.

23:53.466 --> 23:56.603
You're the last person
I would have expected
to be here, Grace.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.573
I'm kind of surprised, too.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.610
Do you have anything to say?

24:03.643 --> 24:07.880
I'm not really sure
what to say
in this kind of situation

24:08.748 --> 24:10.950
because I have never been

24:10.983 --> 24:13.753
in this kind of situation.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.288
You do realize that
this is high school?

24:16.322 --> 24:18.625
Anything that happens here
becomes part of your
permanent record.

24:20.793 --> 24:21.861
I do now.

24:21.894 --> 24:24.864
Whoever stole Harry
broke the glass cabinet.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.032
That's an act of vandalism.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.935
I didn't know that.

24:28.968 --> 24:32.138
In order for our
insurance company
to pay for the repairs,

24:32.171 --> 24:33.773
I had to call the police,
make a report.

24:35.575 --> 24:36.576
The police?

24:42.381 --> 24:43.883
I'm here about the vandalism.

24:55.127 --> 24:56.195
(DOOR CLOSES)

24:56.228 --> 24:57.597
Why did you put Harry
in Grace's locker?

24:58.898 --> 25:00.600
-She told you about that?
-No, she didn't.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.002
I was there when
it fell out right in front
of the Vice Principal.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.436
-Did Grace send you?
-No.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.440
-She wouldn't do that.
-Look, it's no big deal.

25:08.474 --> 25:10.442
I get in trouble all the time.
She'll be fine.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.546
-Man, you are such a...
-What?

25:21.320 --> 25:23.723
-Where is Brandon?
-Uh, he's on a call.

25:23.756 --> 25:26.158
I am looking into a civil
remedy for the wrongs

25:26.192 --> 25:27.760
that were done to me today.

25:27.794 --> 25:30.229
You're gonna sue Brandon
for doing his job?

25:30.262 --> 25:32.031
It was completely
unprofessional of him

25:32.064 --> 25:34.200
to treat me, me,
the mayor of Middleton,

25:34.233 --> 25:36.168
like some sort of
a common criminal.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.037
Well, according to the law,
you were...

25:38.070 --> 25:39.105
-Oh!
-...a criminal.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.674
Poof! Small infractions
and mistakes.

25:41.708 --> 25:44.543
Okay, well, why don't you
just pay the fines?

25:44.577 --> 25:46.212
I will not!

25:46.245 --> 25:47.313
(CHUCKLES)

25:47.346 --> 25:48.615
Lori.

25:48.648 --> 25:51.918
I just came to drop off
some soup for Brandon.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.820
Cassie sent me.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.889
I'm not pleased with
your brother, young lady,
not one bit.

25:56.923 --> 26:00.126
Your father never would
have treated me
with such disrespect.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.695
Well, can I quote
you on that?

26:02.729 --> 26:03.863
Quote?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.497
Well, I came to talk
to my brother,

26:05.531 --> 26:07.767
but it looks like
I just walked in on a story.

26:08.735 --> 26:11.070
I'm, uh, freelancing

26:11.103 --> 26:12.939
-for The Eagle.
-MARTHA: No.

26:12.972 --> 26:15.775
No, no, no.
No quotes. No papers.

26:15.808 --> 26:18.477
"Mayor sues dead hero's son

26:18.510 --> 26:21.513
"whose only crime
was doing his job."

26:21.547 --> 26:23.582
Wow, Lori,
that is a good story.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.251
No, it's not, it's a horrible
story, horrible!

26:25.284 --> 26:27.153
The internet will
probably pick it up.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.587
(GASPS)
The internet?

26:28.621 --> 26:30.222
-(SOFTLY) Oh, yeah.
-And then, bam!

26:30.256 --> 26:32.058
-"Bam"? What "bam"?
-Poof!

26:33.760 --> 26:35.127
It could go viral!

26:36.863 --> 26:37.997
Oh, my.

26:38.030 --> 26:41.333
Don't worry. It'll be Brandon
that looks bad, not you.

26:41.367 --> 26:42.735
Everyone will see that.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.937
You've been wronged,
you're innocent.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.074
So, uh, can I quote you
on that, Mayor?

26:50.276 --> 26:52.979
I would like to pay my fines.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.381
But, Martha, you just said...

26:55.414 --> 26:57.917
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Just because I'm mayor...

26:57.950 --> 26:58.985
(CHUCKLES)

26:59.018 --> 27:00.987
...doesn't mean that
I'm above the law.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.322
Ah...

27:04.857 --> 27:06.625
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

27:07.593 --> 27:10.930
And on that,
you may quote me.

27:19.739 --> 27:22.742
-Okay, deep breath in.
-(INHALES DEEPLY)

27:24.410 --> 27:25.712
And, uh, deep breath out...

27:25.745 --> 27:27.279

27:27.313 --> 27:29.315
(SNIFFLES) Excuse me.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.050
Okay, uh, just breathe...

27:31.083 --> 27:32.151
(SNEEZES)

27:32.184 --> 27:34.153
(CLEARS THROAT AND SNIFFLES)

27:34.186 --> 27:35.387
You okay, Doc?

27:35.421 --> 27:36.823
It's, uh, hydroxycitronellal.

27:36.856 --> 27:39.291
It's a common ingredient
in cologne and aftershave.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.626
I'm really allergic, uh...

27:40.659 --> 27:42.461
Eye swell, congestion,
headaches.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.596
(SNEEZES)

27:44.630 --> 27:46.165
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.167
I'm fine once
I'm away from it.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.670
Once I'm away from it...

28:16.628 --> 28:18.164
What are you doing here?

28:18.197 --> 28:19.698
House call.

28:19.732 --> 28:21.533
-Since when?
-Since now.

28:21.567 --> 28:23.469
I need to see your garage

28:23.502 --> 28:26.172
and, uh, that shirt
you had on earlier.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.041
Did you tell?

28:29.842 --> 28:30.877
No.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.981
But I should have, and
I probably will tomorrow

28:35.014 --> 28:37.349
because I don't want
my permanent record
being screwed up

28:37.383 --> 28:39.085
because... What?

28:39.118 --> 28:42.054
You thought you'd impress
Amber and those dumb jocks
she hangs out with?

28:42.088 --> 28:44.190
I'm not putting my head
in the noose.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.058
You got caught, not me!

28:46.658 --> 28:47.927
Wow.

28:48.795 --> 28:51.030
-You are...
-I'm what?

28:55.534 --> 28:56.903
You know what you are.

28:58.137 --> 28:59.638
And now I do, too.

29:05.577 --> 29:06.645
(DOOR CLOSES)

29:11.717 --> 29:13.719
-I did it.
-Did what?

29:13.752 --> 29:14.887
It's a zebra!

29:15.454 --> 29:17.023
George.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.225
Okay, I should explain.
A zebra is...

29:19.258 --> 29:21.928
Medical slang for coming
to an exotic diagnosis

29:21.961 --> 29:24.463
when a more simple explanation
is more likely.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.132
That's right.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.599
I was convinced that George,

29:27.633 --> 29:30.336
given his age and symptoms,
had some kind
of a cardiac issue.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.104
I mean, it fit, it made sense.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.472
Because I was looking
for the obvious

29:33.505 --> 29:35.341
when I should have been
looking for the zebra!

29:36.442 --> 29:38.510
George is just having
an allergic reaction

29:38.544 --> 29:41.313
to a combination of chemicals
from all the stains and paints

29:41.347 --> 29:42.781
he's been using in the garage.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.683
But when you saw him,
he was in the cafe,

29:44.716 --> 29:47.386
he wasn't around
all the chemicals,
he wasn't in the garage.

29:47.419 --> 29:50.722
No. But his work shirt
had been.

29:50.756 --> 29:52.124
It was saturated
with chemicals,

29:52.158 --> 29:53.325
so he brought
the fumes with him

29:53.359 --> 29:55.294
whenever he wore the shirt.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.764
(EXHALES) So,

29:58.797 --> 30:03.035
it wasn't your herbs
or powders or whatever.

30:04.003 --> 30:06.172
Hmm, I never thought it was.

30:06.605 --> 30:07.907
I did.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.576
And for that, I'm sorry.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.647
George is in a really
good shape.

30:15.681 --> 30:17.283
I know.

30:17.316 --> 30:20.119
I didn't, and I wouldn't
have believed it if I hadn't
examined him myself.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.089
Well, then it's a really
good thing you didn't

30:23.122 --> 30:25.691
pass up that opportunity
when it came along.

30:29.996 --> 30:32.364
Well, if he ever
needs a follow-up,

30:32.398 --> 30:34.700
-I'm here.
-It's good to know.

30:36.735 --> 30:39.571
I still don't believe
in Eastern medicine.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.273
Yet.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.292
Derek told me
what you did to Martha.

31:00.326 --> 31:03.162
Mmm, yeah, well,
we kind of did it together.

31:04.696 --> 31:05.965
Thanks.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.406
This isn't about Dad, is it?

31:15.341 --> 31:16.842
It's about Mom.

31:18.744 --> 31:20.746
It's about both of them.

31:22.814 --> 31:25.451
I can't make any promises,

31:25.484 --> 31:28.087
but I don't plan
on going anywhere.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.090
Good.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.366
BRANDON: What's that?

31:41.433 --> 31:44.103
It's a super stellar

31:44.136 --> 31:47.606
intergalactic portable
protection device

31:47.639 --> 31:50.776
that I bought for Dad
to protect him.

31:50.809 --> 31:52.478
I guess somewhere
inside of me,

31:52.511 --> 31:55.314
there's still
a 10-year-old girl

31:55.347 --> 31:57.249
who thinks this pin
will protect you.

32:08.827 --> 32:10.529
Just be careful, okay?

32:14.900 --> 32:16.335
-(CHUCKLES)
-What?

32:17.836 --> 32:20.939
It's just this, this pin,

32:22.374 --> 32:24.176
it's very "Cassie" of you.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.345
(CHUCKLES)

32:35.121 --> 32:37.223
I know you didn't steal Harry.

32:38.324 --> 32:39.791
I didn't.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.161
It was Nick, wasn't it?

32:44.230 --> 32:45.497
Yeah.

32:46.265 --> 32:47.866
And you're keeping his secret?

32:49.901 --> 32:51.737
I thought that he would
do the right thing.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.073
But he didn't.

32:55.574 --> 32:57.343
And if he doesn't,

32:57.376 --> 32:58.644
you'll have to do
the difficult thing.

33:01.247 --> 33:02.781
I'll tell the principal
in the morning,

33:04.316 --> 33:06.685
but Mom, he's going to lie.

33:06.718 --> 33:07.953
He's not going to admit to it.

33:07.986 --> 33:11.023
And it is going to be
his word against mine.

33:11.057 --> 33:12.958
Well, we can't control
what other people do,

33:12.991 --> 33:14.126
only what we do.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.429
Did you ever have
a sense of someone

33:18.764 --> 33:20.532
and then they turned out
to be completely not

33:20.566 --> 33:22.901
-who you thought they were?
-(SIGHS)

33:22.934 --> 33:26.238
I think life would be
so boring without surprises,
don't you?

33:32.078 --> 33:35.047
VICE PRINCIPAL:
Grace, I know you,

33:35.081 --> 33:36.582
and I know you would never
have done something

33:36.615 --> 33:39.118
so foolish and reckless.

33:39.151 --> 33:42.554
So, I'm going to give you
one last chance to name
the real perpetrator.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.458
The thing is, I...

33:47.426 --> 33:48.660
-Excuse me.
-VICE PRINCIPAL: Nick.

33:48.694 --> 33:49.861
Wait outside, please.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.564
I can't.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.766
-And why's that?
-Uh...

33:57.203 --> 33:58.737
I stole Harry.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.639
Now, you...

34:00.672 --> 34:04.276
You have foolish and reckless
written all over your face.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.579
You may go to class,
Miss Russell.

34:09.515 --> 34:12.951
VICE PRINCIPAL: You, Nick,
are in big trouble.

34:13.752 --> 34:14.753
NICK: Yeah,

34:17.022 --> 34:20.659
this is not my first visit to
the Vice Principal's office.

34:23.629 --> 34:25.264
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

34:33.004 --> 34:35.307
Well, go ahead. Start yelling.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.444
I'm not going to yell.

34:39.111 --> 34:40.979
What's the point?

34:41.012 --> 34:44.483
You're on this
self-destructive kick
at the moment. I...

34:45.984 --> 34:47.953
Don't even know what to say.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.691
Except,

34:53.759 --> 34:54.760
I was wrong.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.698
The way I moved us here,

35:00.632 --> 35:03.269
no warning, "Get in the car".
(SCOFFS)

35:04.303 --> 35:06.505
It wasn't fair to you.

35:06.538 --> 35:09.040
And now you're angry
and you're acting out.

35:11.943 --> 35:12.944
But hear me,

35:14.680 --> 35:16.248
we're staying.

35:16.282 --> 35:17.649
And you can either accept it

35:17.683 --> 35:20.552
or you can keep doing
what you're doing

35:21.753 --> 35:25.056
and risk messing up
the rest of your life.

35:25.090 --> 35:26.492
You're not
a little kid anymore.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.362
And it's time that you took
some responsibility

35:30.396 --> 35:32.964
for your life
and your actions.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.734
So, that's it?

35:36.502 --> 35:38.437
Oh, you're grounded.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.639
For a really long time.

35:41.573 --> 35:44.042
-Hello, Dr. Radford.
-Oh, no.

35:44.075 --> 35:46.077
Away from the office,
call me Sam.

35:46.111 --> 35:48.314
Sam it is.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.916
-Where's the party?
-No, no party, it's, uh...

35:50.949 --> 35:54.253
It's for the dedication
ceremony for Chief Russell.

35:55.187 --> 35:56.222
Jake,

35:57.256 --> 35:58.457
Cassie Nightingale's husband.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.028
(CHUCKLES)

36:11.603 --> 36:12.871
(SIGHS)

36:14.640 --> 36:15.974
Hey, Grandpa.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.615
You know, not many people knew

36:23.649 --> 36:26.252
I didn't want your father
to become a police officer.

36:26.285 --> 36:27.286
Yeah?

36:28.354 --> 36:30.155
I was wrong about him.

36:31.156 --> 36:32.558
And I was wrong about you.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.530
That uniform doesn't wear you,
you wear it.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.466
(CHUCKLES)

36:40.499 --> 36:43.602
-Is this really what you want?
-Like I was born to do it.

36:45.771 --> 36:48.139
Sometimes when you
don't want to see the truth,

36:48.173 --> 36:50.742
you blind yourself to it.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.244
My eyes are wide open now.

36:55.314 --> 36:58.517
I don't know whether
to be happy or sad today.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.552
Oh, I have a feeling today's
gonna be a little bit of both.

37:00.586 --> 37:01.953
(SIGHS)

37:01.987 --> 37:03.021
We should get going.

37:03.655 --> 37:04.890
Oh! By the way,

37:04.923 --> 37:07.493
I broke through
my writer's block today
in your sitting room.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.262
It always works
wonders for me.

37:10.296 --> 37:11.597
(CHUCKLES)

37:14.733 --> 37:16.368
It's a letter of resignation.

37:16.402 --> 37:17.503
I quit my job.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.573
I turned in my
assignment first.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.275
I know it's the right choice.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.844
But you probably
already knew that.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.748
It wasn't just
your sitting room,

37:29.781 --> 37:31.283
it was all the stories
I wrote for Dad.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.521
I'm a storyteller,
not a travel writer.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.389
That you are.

37:37.423 --> 37:39.725
So, what are you gonna do now?

37:39.758 --> 37:43.261
Well, I think Jerry could use
some help at the paper.

37:43.295 --> 37:44.730
I have a feeling he could.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.567
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

37:48.600 --> 37:50.936
-Ryan.
-Hi, everybody.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.104
Just thought I'd offer
the family a ride.

37:53.138 --> 37:54.272
-Thank you.
-GEORGE: Terrific.

37:54.306 --> 37:55.741
Okay.

37:55.774 --> 37:56.942
(CHUCKLES)

38:00.779 --> 38:01.947
Yeah.

38:11.457 --> 38:13.258
Hello, and thank you all

38:13.291 --> 38:16.061
for coming to this
very special dedication

38:16.094 --> 38:17.963
for an extraordinary man.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.399
Chief Jake Russell

38:20.432 --> 38:23.034
protected and served
the people of this town

38:23.068 --> 38:26.237
until his very last day
on this earth.

38:26.271 --> 38:27.706
And so it is with sadness,

38:27.739 --> 38:29.307
but great pride,

38:29.341 --> 38:32.110
that I dedicate
this wing in his honor.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.157
(SNIFFLES)

38:48.093 --> 38:49.327
(EXHALES)

38:51.062 --> 38:54.065
One thing Jake never liked
was long speeches,

38:54.099 --> 38:55.967
-so this'll be short.
-(SLIGHT CHUCKLE)

38:57.102 --> 38:59.405
Most of you knew my husband
before I did.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.774
Some of you didn't.

39:02.808 --> 39:05.711
Most of you remember him
as a young police officer.

39:07.479 --> 39:10.115
Jake was many things
to many people.

39:14.152 --> 39:18.557
But there were only
two things that I wanted
on his tombstone,

39:18.590 --> 39:22.193
to mark what I
consider his greatest
accomplishments in life.

39:23.662 --> 39:26.432
And right under his name,
chiseled in stone,

39:27.766 --> 39:29.901
are the words "loving husband

39:30.702 --> 39:31.937
"and father."

39:37.943 --> 39:41.012
I promised
I'd keep this short,

39:41.046 --> 39:44.983
so I'll finish by saying
that if there is
a silver lining to this,

39:46.552 --> 39:47.719
and those of you
that know me know

39:47.753 --> 39:49.555
I'm always looking
for that silver lining...

39:49.588 --> 39:50.722
(SLIGHT CHUCKLE)

39:51.657 --> 39:53.191
I have my family
back together.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.328
And I know Jake
would've loved that.

39:57.362 --> 39:58.930
I... I know I do.

40:00.832 --> 40:03.669
Dad brought us all
back together again.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.103
That he did.

40:07.939 --> 40:09.775
Thank you all for being here.
