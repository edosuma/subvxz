00:16.638 --> 00:19.338
The best I could do.
The Nikel's truck got the best spot.

00:19.339 --> 00:21.339
Screw 'em. The customers are loyal.

00:21.340 --> 00:22.640

- Passion flower.

00:31.442 --> 00:33.542
That's right. Someone said it.
Passion flower.

Tell that to the cook and get
free dim sum and a drink.

I wouldn't be so sure,

01:27.926 --> 01:29.724
Especially not now.

01:34.996 --> 01:35.993
Who was that?

01:35.994 --> 01:37.087
What did he mean?

01:37.088 --> 01:39.250
Nothing.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.867
You mean you don't
want to marry me?

03:25.271 --> 03:27.372
Of course.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.240
Just leave him, say the word.

03:30.241 --> 03:32.341
If it were just that easy.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.043
Look, I'll talk to him.

Parking enforcement
called the towing company

06:27.443 --> 06:28.910
around 3:0p.M.

06:28.911 --> 06:31.345
Mm-hmm. And who opened
the trunk, harley?

06:31.346 --> 06:33.581
The tow truck driver.

06:33.582 --> 06:36.285
Apparently it's not the
first time he's rifl a car.

06:36.286 --> 06:37.820
The owner's firing him.

06:37.821 --> 06:39.321
Well, he discovered the body,

06:39.322 --> 06:41.757
So have him hang around
for an interview.

06:41.758 --> 06:44.292
We have one gunshot wound,

06:44.293 --> 06:45.860
Back of the head, no exit wound.

06:45.861 --> 06:47.527
So probably a.22.

06:47.528 --> 06:49.395
Maximum damage, minimum blood.

06:49.396 --> 06:50.896
Time of death?

06:50.897 --> 06:52.164
Rigor mortis has come and gone.

06:52.165 --> 06:53.865
Judging by t limited
seepage of blood,

06:53.866 --> 06:57.201
I'd say the body was placed
here a half-hour after death.

06:57.202 --> 06:59.669
Hmm. Oh, here we go.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.008
Dumpedith the body.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.142
Could be a pro.

07:22.189 --> 07:23.823
My brother's building sites.

07:23.824 --> 07:25.190
The crime scene s ticulous,

07:25.191 --> 07:26.658
But we're checking for latents.

07:26.659 --> 07:27.726
Ballistics has said

07:27.727 --> 07:29.560
The murd weapon's untraceable.

07:29.561 --> 07:31.062
Well, it sounds like
they hired the best

07:31.063 --> 07:32.296
And got what they paid for.

07:32.297 --> 07:33.998
That's rht.
The surveillance camera

07:33.999 --> 07:35.132
In that parking area,

07:35.133 --> 07:36.699
It was shot with a paintball gun.

07:36.700 --> 07:39.001
That's new, and very clever.

07:39.002 --> 07:40.469
Yeah, of crse,
we're checking tapes

07:40.470 --> 07:42.604
Fr cameras at the entrance.

07:42.605 --> 07:44.939
So, ryan foley, huh?

07:44.940 --> 07:47.008
Married? Single? Family problems?

07:47.009 --> 07:49.944
Divorced five years ago, no kids,

07:49.945 --> 07:52.346
No lsuits, no evidence of acrimony.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.215
Yeah, found at the airport.
Coming or going?

07:54.216 --> 07:55.749
We called his office,

07:55.750 --> 07:58.384
And althey'd say is he was
gone for a couple of days,

07:58.385 --> 07:59.852
Wouldn't say where.

07:59.853 --> 08:02.855
Do a scan of all the
airlines out of laguardia.

08:02.856 --> 08:06.958
Here. He booked a single
seat on flight 189 to miami,

08:06.959 --> 08:10.027
A window seat in firstlass.

08:10.028 --> 08:13.096
But-and this is very revealing-

08:13.097 --> 08:14.764
It doesn't match
the traveler manifest

08:14.765 --> 08:16.132
For where he actually sat?

08:16.133 --> 08:17.432
Yeah.

08:17.433 --> 08:19.200
He changed seats after he boarded.

08:19.201 --> 08:22.003
Downgraded to coach, an
aisle seanear the back.

08:22.004 --> 08:23.303
Uh-huh

08:23.304 --> 08:26.806
Well, you know,
good-looking single guy,

08:26.807 --> 08:29.575
He would only downgrade to, uh,

08:29.576 --> 08:32.376
Sit next to an upgrade.

08:32.378 --> 08:34.979
He moved to 30d.

08:34.980 --> 08:37.447
30e was angela caldera.

08:40.551 --> 08:44.287
Yes, I saw ryan when I was
getting my boarding pass.

08:44.288 --> 08:46.089
We happened to be
on the same flight.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.825
Mm-hmm, I see.

08:47.826 --> 08:49.327
And then ryan switched seats.

08:49.328 --> 08:51.429
He wanted to-he wanted
to sit near you, huh?

08:51.430 --> 08:52.731
Oh, just being friendly.

08:52.732 --> 08:55.067
We knew each other, but not well.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.469
We use his catering firm a lot.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.471
I see. "we" meaning?

08:59.472 --> 09:02.641
I'm special counsel on
senator cdera's campaign.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.178
I see.

09:04.179 --> 09:05.949
And you're related to the senator,

09:05.950 --> 09:07.551
I assume by marriage?

09:07.552 --> 09:09.586
You mean how did an
irish-american like me

09:09.587 --> 09:10.921
Become a caldera?

09:10.922 --> 09:13.491
Um, I'm his daughter-in-law.

09:13.492 --> 09:14.893
So you and ryan,

09:14.894 --> 09:16.795
What d you, uh, talk about?

09:16.796 --> 09:19.531
Uh, I don't know.

09:19.532 --> 09:21.401
Um, mainly problems he was having

09:21.402 --> 09:22.770
With his food truck business.

09:22.771 --> 09:26.842
Mm-hmm. Problems with,
uh, anybody specific?

09:26.843 --> 09:29.177
I was distract, barely listeng.

09:29.178 --> 09:31.781
Did yosee mr.
Foley while you were in miami?

09:31.782 --> 09:33.550
No. Uh, we landed,

09:33.551 --> 09:35.753
And I went my way, and he went his.

09:37.322 --> 09:39.090
Is everything okay, angela?

09:39.091 --> 09:41.422
Yes. These detectives
were just asking

09:41.423 --> 09:43.056
About somedy I knew from work.

09:43.057 --> 09:46.520
Ryan foley. He catered our events.

09:46.521 --> 09:47.954
Apparently he was killed.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.154
Oh.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.188
You didn't know him, mr. Caldera?

09:51.189 --> 09:52.854
Oh, no, I have my own business.

09:52.855 --> 09:55.786
I don't work in my
father's campaign.

09:55.787 --> 09:57.788
And, um, I barelynew him,

09:57.789 --> 09:59.289
So...

09:59.290 --> 10:01.691
Sorry I can't be of more help.

10:04.027 --> 10:05.594
Not a happy marriage.

10:05.595 --> 10:08.262
You see the slight cringe
when he touched her.

10:08.263 --> 10:09.864
And you're thinking

10:09.865 --> 10:12.298
That she didn't cringe
like that with ryan.

10:12.299 --> 10:14.667
Mm-hmm.

10:17.104 --> 10:19.405
You're very quiet.

10:19.406 --> 10:21.273
It's maureen.

10:21.274 --> 10:22.974
Doctors say she's not
out of the woods yet.

10:22.975 --> 10:26.043
It's nice that you could
spend time with your sister.

10:26.044 --> 10:27.610
Yeah.

10:27.611 --> 10:31.113
But she still has a
few more procedures.

10:31.114 --> 10:33.014
So you'll go back to miami?

10:33.015 --> 10:34.749
Well, not if I have
anytng to say about it.

10:34.750 --> 10:37.518
I'm facing the meanest
re-election my life.

10:37.519 --> 10:39.286
I need angela here.

10:39.287 --> 10:41.521
I need that irish charm out
in those neighborhoods.

10:41.522 --> 10:43.123
Hey, you like the
speech for tonight?

10:43.124 --> 10:44.558
Intro needs a little punching up.

10:44.559 --> 10:47.262
Mm-hmm. Angela...Thoughts?

10:47.263 --> 10:49.865
Uh... I'll have to read it again.

10:49.866 --> 10:52.034
Hey, I wouldn't worry.

10:52.035 --> 10:54.169
You're still up by 13 peent
in today's polls, right?

10:54.170 --> 10:55.471
That's a snapshot.

10:55.472 --> 10:57.473
<i>Those numbers chge
every day, caro.</i>

10:57.474 --> 10:58.774
Still seems encouraging.

10:58.775 --> 11:00.042
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.

11:00.043 --> 11:01.443
Your best contribution
to this campaign

11:01.444 --> 11:02.844
Was marrying this one right here.

11:02.845 --> 11:06.148
Hey, let me see what
you got there, huh?

11:06.149 --> 11:07.249
Look what mom bought me.

11:07.250 --> 11:10.418
Oh, my god, that is so nice.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.654
No, no. I can wipe
my own son's nose.

11:12.655 --> 11:15.089
Angie, I think we need
to have another baby.

11:15.090 --> 11:16.791
Too much focus on this little guy.

11:16.792 --> 11:21.029
That's because this
little boy is perfection.

11:21.030 --> 11:23.097
Yes.

11:25.968 --> 11:27.635
Yes, you are.

11:27.636 --> 11:29.904
So this is our only footage

11:29.905 --> 11:33.074
Of the driver as he
enters the parking lot.

11:33.075 --> 11:35.544
He keeps his face tucked
down away from the camera.

11:35.545 --> 11:36.912
He's wearing his gloves,

11:36.913 --> 11:38.580
So no prints.

11:38.581 --> 11:40.315
But look at that watch.

11:40.316 --> 11:42.685
It's been identified
as a gold rolex.

11:42.686 --> 11:45.321
I got a call from the head of csu

11:45.322 --> 11:47.588
About bmw keys they
found in a trash can.

11:47.589 --> 11:49.487
They match ryan foley's car?

11:49.488 --> 11:50.852
Even better.

11:50.853 --> 11:51.986
They found a partial print

11:51.987 --> 11:53.554
That matched latents on the trunk.

11:53.555 --> 11:55.689
They belong to angela caldera.

11:55.690 --> 11:58.291
She's in the system?

11:58.292 --> 11:59.792
Yeah, a d.U.I.
A couple years back.

11:59.793 --> 12:01.060
It went away.

12:01.061 --> 12:03.295
Maybe somebody called in a favor.

12:03.296 --> 12:07.032
Angela's, uh, trip to
miami was a lovers' getaway.

12:07.033 --> 12:08.333
And now it gs tricky.

12:08.334 --> 12:09.467
Tricky.

12:09.468 --> 12:10.768
So we don't we just move on her?

12:10.769 --> 12:12.369
The senator's facing re-election.

12:12.370 --> 12:14.838
Any blood in the water around
a cheating daughter-in-law,

12:14.839 --> 12:17.641
And we have a media feeding
frenzy instead of a case.

12:17.642 --> 12:19.976
Let's use that to our advantage.

12:19.977 --> 12:22.011
I give it as a reason
to meet her solo

12:22.012 --> 12:23.579
And confront her with what know.

12:23.580 --> 12:25.014
I like that. She'll trust you.

12:25.015 --> 12:26.315
Yeah, she'll open up.

12:26.316 --> 12:27.516
Thanks.

12:52.135 --> 12:53.669
You been crying?

12:53.670 --> 12:55.137
No, no.

12:55.138 --> 12:56.204
I'm fine.

13:03.743 --> 13:09.079
You don't talk, you
barely look at me.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.947
What the hell's going on, angela?

13:21.854 --> 13:24.855
You can talk to me.

13:24.856 --> 13:27.456
I'm always here for you.

13:27.457 --> 13:28.857
I'm just tired.

13:28.858 --> 13:29.958
That's all.

13:39.803 --> 13:41.706
Promise you'll never leave me.

13:41.707 --> 13:43.878
No...

13:43.879 --> 13:45.248
Never.

13:49.023 --> 13:50.357
You can't duck this, angela.

13:50.358 --> 13:53.560
Eventually, we'll have
to move on our evidence.

13:54.561 --> 13:56.062
You're really alone?

13:56.163 --> 13:59.098
It's just me.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.967
I-I can't do this now,

14:00.268 --> 14:01.735
Not with my son here.

14:01.736 --> 14:05.639
It's not safe.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.943
What are you so
afraid of, angela?

14:10.944 --> 14:12.978
If I bring you to headquarters,

14:12.979 --> 14:16.248
Word of that will
make every tabloid.

14:17.049 --> 14:18.817
You want that?

14:20.886 --> 14:23.386
And this stays just between us?

14:26.957 --> 14:28.890
Yeah. Let's start

14:28.891 --> 14:30.724
With why you didn't
fly back together.

14:32.326 --> 14:34.426
Ryan left early.

14:34.427 --> 14:37.495
Another food truck vendor
was causing problems.

14:37.496 --> 14:39.698
Know his name?

14:39.699 --> 14:40.966
No.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.035
But we saw him on the
way to the airport.

14:43.036 --> 14:46.505
His truck said "falafel king."

14:46.506 --> 14:48.639
You were driving ryan's car?

14:48.640 --> 14:51.542
No. Ryan drove.

14:51.543 --> 14:53.578
Angela, your prints?

14:58.417 --> 15:01.051
When I came back,

15:01.052 --> 15:04.924
There was a message
waiting for me from ryan.

15:04.925 --> 15:07.028
It said he wanted to see me

15:07.029 --> 15:09.127
And where to find his car.

15:13.328 --> 15:15.762
You found his body.

15:18.063 --> 15:21.765
I dumped the keys in
the trash and ran.

15:23.434 --> 15:24.901
You and your husband...

15:24.902 --> 15:26.569
Did he know about the affair?

15:26.570 --> 15:28.003
No.

15:28.004 --> 15:32.040
And even if he did,
it wouldn't matter.

15:32.041 --> 15:34.008
They'd never let me leave.

15:34.009 --> 15:35.142
They?

15:35.143 --> 15:37.310
The calderas.

15:37.311 --> 15:42.714
I spoke to an attorney
about leaving rick.

15:42.715 --> 15:45.516
But when I said the
divorce was my idea,

15:45.517 --> 15:47.784
That victor caldera
would oppose it...

15:50.388 --> 15:52.553
He refused to represent me.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.325
Husband didn't know?

16:01.326 --> 16:03.126
Cheating wives always think that,

16:03.127 --> 16:04.827
And usually they're wrong.

16:04.828 --> 16:06.862
So what do we know
about rick caldera?

16:06.863 --> 16:08.163
That he's an only child.

16:08.164 --> 16:10.403
That's unusual
for a latin family.

16:10.404 --> 16:13.373
Yeah, he started
poli-sci at columbia,

16:13.374 --> 16:15.277
But he's never held
a job in politics.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.281
His business is scaffolding.

16:17.282 --> 16:18.416
So money, but not much glamour

16:18.417 --> 16:19.584
For political royalty.

16:19.585 --> 16:21.885
But angela's very
front and center

16:21.886 --> 16:23.319
To the caldera campaign.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.755
She's from a low-income
irish family,

16:25.756 --> 16:27.390
Parents died when she was six.

16:27.391 --> 16:29.826
She and her sister have moved
in and out of foster homes.

16:29.827 --> 16:32.362
Well, her looks and
lack of latin ethnicity

16:32.363 --> 16:34.764
Open caldera's appeal to a
much wider constituency.

16:34.765 --> 16:36.132
That's smart.

16:36.133 --> 16:39.301
"family power: The
core of our strength."

16:39.302 --> 16:42.204
This brochure features
angela and her son, bobby,

16:42.205 --> 16:43.939
But no rick.

16:43.940 --> 16:46.875
So the heir apparent's a
disappointment and a cuckold.

16:46.876 --> 16:49.447
It's tough role in
a family like that.

16:49.448 --> 16:51.616
Reason to harbor some rage.

16:51.617 --> 16:54.051
So we need to know what
rick knew and when he knew it.

16:54.052 --> 16:55.552
That's a problem for me.

16:55.553 --> 16:58.355
I led angela to think
we wouldn't contact him.

16:58.356 --> 17:01.091
Our investigation
outweighs her concerns.

17:01.092 --> 17:02.392
And mine?

17:02.393 --> 17:04.394
I sort of gave my word.

17:04.395 --> 17:05.795
First of all, you don't cheat,

17:05.796 --> 17:09.065
And if you do, don't trust a cop.

17:12.803 --> 17:14.537
Not my first election year.

17:14.538 --> 17:16.306
I mean, to get at my father,

17:16.307 --> 17:18.675
People will say anything
about any of us.

17:18.675 --> 17:20.676
It's a nasty rumor, nothing more.

17:20.678 --> 17:22.712
I'm afraid it's
way beyond a rumor.

17:22.713 --> 17:25.114
- I'm all dressed, papa.
- Hey, buddy, slow down.

17:25.115 --> 17:26.348
Here, look, put this on.

17:30.887 --> 17:32.121
We have a son,

17:32.122 --> 17:33.456
A family.

17:33.457 --> 17:35.023
She wouldn't do this to us.

17:35.024 --> 17:37.227
You honestly don't know
about her trip to miami?

17:37.228 --> 17:38.829
Yeah, she went for
her sister's surgery.

17:38.830 --> 17:40.463
A miami hotel has confirmed

17:40.464 --> 17:42.131
That she and ryan foley
were there together.

17:46.770 --> 17:49.038
But she called every night

17:49.039 --> 17:51.306
To say good night to me and bobby.

17:51.307 --> 17:52.808
And you know this for certain?

17:52.809 --> 17:54.976
Mm-hmm, yeah.

17:56.745 --> 18:00.181
We need to know where you were
the day before she returned.

18:00.182 --> 18:02.583
You think I had something
to do with his death?

18:02.584 --> 18:05.319
Just verify your whereabouts.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.487
I took bobby to school,

18:07.488 --> 18:09.923
Then I bid on a
scaffolding job uptown.

18:09.924 --> 18:11.158
That accounts for half the day.

18:11.159 --> 18:12.860
I picked him up that afternoon,

18:12.861 --> 18:14.228
Then we went to visit my mother.

18:14.229 --> 18:15.796
Okay, are you satisfied?

18:15.797 --> 18:16.964
That helps. Thank you.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.432
Yeah. Well, it doesn't help me.

18:18.433 --> 18:21.737
Papa, I can't do my shin guards.

18:25.075 --> 18:26.276
Buddy.

18:28.380 --> 18:31.979
Our trucks go to the Senator's rallies
speeches, but I never met his son.

18:32.051 --> 18:33.953
Yeah. I'm so sorry, mrs. Dugan.

18:33.954 --> 18:35.154
It must be pretty tough losing

18:35.155 --> 18:37.155
The guy that created all this, huh?

18:37.156 --> 18:39.291
Ryan was very good to us.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.592
We heard about trouble with
another food truck vendor,

18:41.593 --> 18:43.160
The falafel king?

18:43.161 --> 18:44.928
nikhil fayed.

18:44.929 --> 18:47.964
Yes. Ryan's death is
a windfall for him.

18:47.965 --> 18:50.166
He's grabbed all our territories.

18:50.167 --> 18:51.833
Even the caldera campaign?

18:51.834 --> 18:53.801
I can't confirm that.

18:53.802 --> 18:57.571
Hmm. Any actual confrontations
between ryan and...

18:57.572 --> 18:59.406
Nikhil fayed.

18:59.407 --> 19:02.341
While ryan was in miami,
our trucks were vandalized.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.410
Yeah, that trip to miami,

19:04.411 --> 19:06.879
Did he mention the reason
for that, uh, mrs. Dugan?

19:06.880 --> 19:08.983
He just needed a break.

19:08.984 --> 19:13.558
Did he tell you who she was?

19:13.559 --> 19:17.864
You're making me uncomfortable.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.834
Take comfort in helping
us find his killer.

19:20.835 --> 19:23.403
We know ryan went away
with angela caldera.

19:28.242 --> 19:30.910
He didn't tell me that.

19:30.911 --> 19:33.112
I actually heard it from nikhil.

19:33.113 --> 19:35.515
He called here, said he'd seen them

19:35.516 --> 19:37.316
And bragged he'd
cause real trouble.

19:37.317 --> 19:39.585
Did you mention to
ryan that he said that?

19:43.623 --> 19:49.427
So business looks good, nikhil.

19:49.428 --> 19:50.930
What is the problem?

19:50.931 --> 19:54.034
This is a spot you and ryan
foley were fighting over.

19:54.035 --> 19:56.704
You seem to have benefited
nicely from his death.

20:00.709 --> 20:02.743
Listen, I have 12 trucks

20:02.744 --> 20:04.611
That serve over 2,000 people a day.

20:04.612 --> 20:06.680
They were my customers always.

20:06.681 --> 20:08.982
Was that before or
after you threatened ryan

20:08.983 --> 20:10.384
And vandalized his trucks?

20:10.385 --> 20:12.052
I don't play dirty.

20:12.053 --> 20:13.186
I just work hard.

20:13.187 --> 20:14.787
Yeah, but you caught some breaks,

20:14.788 --> 20:18.157
Like, uh, special treatment
from senator caldera.

20:18.158 --> 20:20.426
Well, people talk trash about me.

20:20.427 --> 20:21.660
It's not because the senator

20:21.661 --> 20:23.128
Appreciated you telling him

20:23.129 --> 20:26.030
That ryan foley was doing
his daughter-in-law?

20:27.999 --> 20:30.400
You don't know that.
You have no proof.

20:30.401 --> 20:33.003
The proof is in
the way you bragged.

20:33.004 --> 20:35.072
I'm done here.
I got a business to run.

20:37.976 --> 20:40.377
So he tells the senator,

20:40.378 --> 20:42.545
Ryan comes back and gets murdered.

20:42.546 --> 20:45.248
So we're thinking victor caldera?

20:45.249 --> 20:46.582
That puts this

20:46.583 --> 20:48.784
Right where our captain
was hoping it wouldn't go.

20:48.785 --> 20:52.321
Is there a choice?

20:52.322 --> 20:54.656
Not really.

20:54.657 --> 20:58.727
So profiles on senator caldera
are countless and endless.

20:58.728 --> 21:01.130
Yes, but all puff-piece fodder.

21:01.131 --> 21:03.165
Here, his prize from the e.P.A.,

21:03.166 --> 21:04.834
His support for bio-fuel research.

21:04.835 --> 21:06.001
But look at this.

21:06.002 --> 21:07.803
Look at this picture
from the fifth grade

21:07.804 --> 21:09.138
With a science award.

21:09.139 --> 21:11.040
Look at that smile.

21:11.041 --> 21:12.675
Happy kid headed
for bigger things.

21:12.676 --> 21:16.178
Yeah, well, his father
taught grammar school, math.

21:16.179 --> 21:18.280
You know, they were lower
middle class in the bronx...

21:18.281 --> 21:19.615
Mm-hmm.

21:19.616 --> 21:22.584
And then along
comes marta castillo.

21:22.585 --> 21:25.554
They met as undergrads at columbia.

21:25.555 --> 21:27.256
Who's that guy in
the doorman's braid?

21:27.257 --> 21:28.290
Oh.

21:28.291 --> 21:30.892
This is marta's father,

21:30.893 --> 21:33.195
General omar castillo.

21:33.196 --> 21:34.596
He came close to
running the country,

21:34.597 --> 21:37.232
Till his coup went sour.

21:37.233 --> 21:41.069
With him for a father,
she learned a few tricks.

21:41.070 --> 21:43.972
Yeah, so she marries
the math teacher's son,

21:43.973 --> 21:46.641
And with her tricks
and his charisma,

21:46.642 --> 21:50.045
We've got senator caldera,

21:50.046 --> 21:52.313
A guy who bases his whole campaign

21:52.314 --> 21:54.082
On the virtues of family,

21:54.083 --> 21:56.618
While his daughter-in-law
sleeps around.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.720
So what nikhil told him

21:58.721 --> 22:00.488
Represented a major threat.

22:00.489 --> 22:02.023
Adultery in the family.

22:02.024 --> 22:04.559
Right. Now, does he tell his son,

22:04.560 --> 22:06.628
"suck it up till I'm re-elected"?

22:10.165 --> 22:13.034
"family power: The
core of our strength."

22:15.104 --> 22:16.971
Or did he deal with it himself?

22:20.842 --> 22:22.009
Tough mid-term, senator.

22:22.010 --> 22:23.677
Think you'll hold on to your seat?

22:23.678 --> 22:25.479
Well, you know, that's
what the polls are saying,

22:25.480 --> 22:27.148
But I'm gonna tell you something,

22:27.149 --> 22:28.482
It's not about who win- hey, huh?

22:28.483 --> 22:29.750
It's not about who
wins or or loses.

22:29.751 --> 22:31.151
It's about communities, you know.

22:31.152 --> 22:34.321
It's about brooklyn,
washington heights,

22:34.322 --> 22:35.690
Staten island.

22:35.691 --> 22:37.358
We're talking families, right?

22:37.359 --> 22:38.459
My family.

22:38.460 --> 22:40.328
My grandson right here.

22:40.329 --> 22:41.896
<i>Mi familia.</i>

22:44.200 --> 22:46.501
Senator caldera, mrs. Caldera.

22:46.502 --> 22:48.269
I'm detective nichols.

22:48.270 --> 22:50.137
This is my partner,
detective stevens.

22:50.138 --> 22:52.440
So courting the law
enforcement vote has paid off.

22:52.441 --> 22:54.375
Actually, we're here
to talk to your husband

22:54.376 --> 22:55.543
About ryan foley.

22:55.544 --> 22:58.112
Ah.

22:58.113 --> 22:59.614
<i>Trae bobby a la casa.</i>

22:59.615 --> 23:00.681
Go with tio nando.

23:04.486 --> 23:05.686
Gee, can I see that?

23:05.687 --> 23:07.487
That's a nice watch. Look at that.

23:07.488 --> 23:10.824
What is that? Is that a gold rolex?

23:10.825 --> 23:12.393
Belonged to my father.

23:12.394 --> 23:16.630
One of the few possessions
left to us after the coup.

23:16.631 --> 23:18.699
You know, I only
have a few moments.

23:18.700 --> 23:20.802
It's a tragedy about mr. Foley.

23:20.803 --> 23:23.204
He was a strong supporter.
We're with you, senator!

23:23.205 --> 23:26.140
Yes, senator, is, uh...

23:26.141 --> 23:29.243
Is nikhil fayed a strong supporter?

23:29.244 --> 23:31.145
Seems he's been
getting the favors

23:31.146 --> 23:33.314
That used to come ryan foley's way.

23:33.315 --> 23:34.582
Favors?

23:34.583 --> 23:36.116
Catering our campaign?

23:36.117 --> 23:39.686
No. No, no, we choose
on a best offer basis.

23:39.687 --> 23:40.888
Did nikhil sweeten the deal

23:40.889 --> 23:42.423
With the revelation that ryan foley

23:42.424 --> 23:43.724
Was sleeping with your son's wife?

23:43.725 --> 23:47.527
You know, I'm gonna
tell you something.

23:47.528 --> 23:49.563
In politics,

23:49.564 --> 23:52.098
One masters the art of
ignoring the vile rumor.

23:52.099 --> 23:54.234
I'm gonna tell you something.

23:54.235 --> 23:56.202
We have evidence that angela

23:56.203 --> 23:59.672
Was involved with
ryan foley, senator.

23:59.673 --> 24:02.742
The senator and I have great
respect for the work you do,

24:02.743 --> 24:04.643
But don't push beyond civility

24:04.644 --> 24:06.312
And make us regret what we feel.

24:09.182 --> 24:10.615
Excuse us.

24:14.187 --> 24:15.987
I found some
classified information

24:15.988 --> 24:17.355
In a state department database

24:17.356 --> 24:19.457
About marta caldera's brother.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.825
His name is hernando,

24:20.826 --> 24:23.161
Known within the clan as tio nando.

24:23.162 --> 24:26.030
Tio nando? Uncle nando?
That's cute.

24:26.031 --> 24:28.533
Mm-hmm. Well, if your
dad is general castillo,

24:28.534 --> 24:31.169
Noted for merciless killings
and a bloody coup attempt,

24:31.170 --> 24:34.005
"cute" is kind of helpful.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.340
So, here.

24:35.341 --> 24:37.542
He also got an arrest
here in new york.

24:37.543 --> 24:39.877
15 years ago,

24:39.878 --> 24:41.779
He beat a man to death.

24:44.283 --> 24:45.683
Really?

24:45.684 --> 24:47.953
Let me guess.
The case went from a murder

24:47.954 --> 24:51.023
To justifiable homicide
on a self-defense plea.

24:51.024 --> 24:53.692
And all the charges were dropped.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.327
It was during victor's stint

24:55.328 --> 24:57.496
In the new york attorney
general's office.

24:57.497 --> 25:02.431
Oh, so while victor
owes his political rise

25:02.432 --> 25:04.633
To castillo family money,

25:04.634 --> 25:08.603
Tio nando is also
beholden to victor

25:08.604 --> 25:11.839
And becomes the go-to
guy for family problems.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.709
Like a cheating wife.

25:14.710 --> 25:17.711
Angela, get back here.

25:17.712 --> 25:19.579
- Oh!
- You're not going anywhere!

25:19.580 --> 25:22.582
Oh! Ah! Unh!

25:22.583 --> 25:24.083
What, you think you
can screw around?

25:24.084 --> 25:26.286
- No, I-
- huh?

25:26.287 --> 25:28.821
You got cops, everybody,

25:28.822 --> 25:31.024
Laughing at me? Huh?

25:31.025 --> 25:32.525
What was I thinking?

25:32.526 --> 25:34.093
I married a slut.

25:34.094 --> 25:37.264
Rick, please, stop.

25:37.265 --> 25:38.799
Police! I married a slut.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.800
What the hell do
you expect me to do?

25:40.801 --> 25:42.234
Come on, come on, back off.

25:42.235 --> 25:43.402
That's enough. Get him down.

25:43.403 --> 25:46.004
Unh!

25:46.005 --> 25:47.639
Give me your hands. Hold still.

25:47.640 --> 25:50.107
You're doing so well.

25:50.108 --> 25:52.109
Much faster than last week.

25:52.110 --> 25:54.845
Do you remember that
school I told you about,

25:54.846 --> 25:55.879
Horace mann?

25:55.880 --> 25:57.614
Yeah. Do they teach
computer there?

25:57.615 --> 26:00.983
<i>mi tesoro.</i>

26:07.523 --> 26:08.856
Hello?

26:11.693 --> 26:14.561
Tell the housekeeper it's
time for your snack, okay?

26:19.200 --> 26:22.201
Yes, off course.

26:22.202 --> 26:23.802
<i>En seguida, rick.</i>

26:23.803 --> 26:24.936
Hey, what now?

26:24.937 --> 26:27.071
Rick's in jail.

26:27.072 --> 26:29.206
He attacked angela.

26:34.912 --> 26:37.246
How do I keep that
under the radar, huh?

26:37.247 --> 26:40.682
We need to post bail,

26:40.683 --> 26:42.084
Make a public show of support.

26:42.085 --> 26:44.686
For a wife-beater.

26:44.687 --> 26:46.121
How do you spin that?

26:46.122 --> 26:49.291
By supporting angela.

26:49.292 --> 26:51.226
Focus on her.

26:51.227 --> 26:53.295
All families have crises.

26:53.296 --> 26:57.633
Now we show decency, compassion,

26:57.634 --> 27:00.335
Concern for our beloved
daughter-in-law.

27:04.441 --> 27:06.375
People will relate to that.

27:20.563 --> 27:22.530
Yes, I do blame you, not him.

27:22.531 --> 27:24.898
It's because you shamed him.

27:24.899 --> 27:26.866
Yeah, but having
secrets hasn't exactly

27:26.867 --> 27:28.734
Helped you in the past.

27:28.735 --> 27:30.869
In any case, somebody else

27:30.870 --> 27:33.236
Could have told rick about ryan,

27:33.237 --> 27:35.105
Maybe while you guys
were still in miami.

27:35.106 --> 27:37.909
What mes you say that?

27:37.910 --> 27:39.776
Well, we're pretty
certain victor knew.

27:39.777 --> 27:41.710
- How?
- It doesn't matter how.

27:41.711 --> 27:43.513
Rick could've spoken to nando...

27:43.514 --> 27:45.016
Tio nando?

27:50.489 --> 27:53.391
I-I know what you're saying,

27:53.392 --> 27:55.392
But he wouldn't do that for rick.

27:55.393 --> 27:56.527
Mm-hmm.

27:56.528 --> 27:58.429
Well, uh, angela,

27:58.430 --> 28:00.198
Who would he do things for?

28:00.199 --> 28:02.601
Stop bringing up the family.

28:02.602 --> 28:05.537
The food truck g,
ryan's competitor,

28:05.538 --> 28:06.939
That's who killed him.

28:06.940 --> 28:09.075
Angela, it's too late to lie.

28:09.076 --> 28:12.106
Angela, we could arrange
it so that you and your son

28:12.107 --> 28:13.908
Go into witnesprotection.

28:13.909 --> 28:16.243
No. I don't want that.

28:19.079 --> 28:22.514
I want you to leave.

28:22.515 --> 28:26.084
Victor caldera is a powerful man.

28:31.124 --> 28:32.558
A captive mentality.

28:32.559 --> 28:36.228
A poor girl suddenly
surrounded by wealth and power.

28:36.229 --> 28:38.496
She might have at one time felt
lucky to be part of them...

28:38.497 --> 28:40.398
- Uh-huh,.
- Now she's just plain scared.

28:40.399 --> 28:41.665
Ah, maybe rightly so.

28:41.666 --> 28:43.033
They could have eyes everywhere.

28:43.034 --> 28:45.902
Maybe victor always
had her followed.

28:45.903 --> 28:48.371
Maybe ryan wasn't the first.

28:48.372 --> 28:50.038
If she slipped
away for other trysts

28:50.039 --> 28:51.607
While on the campaign trail,

28:51.608 --> 28:54.142
Campaigns, by law, have to
keep detailed travel records.

28:54.143 --> 28:55.677
Yeah? Let's check her travel,

28:55.678 --> 28:57.445
See if it syncs up with tio nando.

28:57.446 --> 28:59.347
Angela's travel records,

28:59.348 --> 29:01.315
We learned it was tough
for her to cheat.

29:01.316 --> 29:03.383
The watchful eye of tio nando?

29:03.384 --> 29:04.918
Someone even closer to home.

29:04.919 --> 29:06.152
Yeah, she was always in the compa

29:06.153 --> 29:08.420
Of her father-in-law. Inseparable.

29:08.421 --> 29:10.155
Every high-end junket?

29:10.156 --> 29:11.756
Yeah, he occasionally
goes without her,

29:11.757 --> 29:13.290
But it's never the
other way around.

29:13.291 --> 29:15.925
Here. Four days at
the puntacana resort.

29:15.926 --> 29:19.093
Victor has a bungalow,
angela's not even registered.

29:19.094 --> 29:23.897
And why are we certain she
wasn't there on this occasion?

29:23.898 --> 29:26.465
I'm serious. Think dirty.

29:26.466 --> 29:27.499
Why?

29:27.500 --> 29:29.600
Okay.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.102
Here, chking a press
release from that visit...

29:32.103 --> 29:34.004
Oh, here. It does mentions angela.

29:34.005 --> 29:35.305
She was there.

29:35.306 --> 29:37.740
She checked into san
nicolas hospital,

29:37.741 --> 29:40.075
Uh, six years ago.

29:40.076 --> 29:41.943
Isn't her son around six?

29:43.512 --> 29:45.145
Bobby was born during that trip.

29:45.146 --> 29:47.981
Yeah, it says here
that rick and rta

29:47.982 --> 29:50.483
Flew in on a private
jet the following day.

29:50.484 --> 29:53.121
So angela had her
ba out of the country

29:53.122 --> 29:56.094
Without her husband at her sid

29:56.095 --> 29:57.763
Why?

30:00.901 --> 30:02.634
Sorry I'm late.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.035
Is bobby ready?

30:04.036 --> 30:05.102
Well, he's asleep.

30:05.103 --> 30:06.303
He's gonna stay here night.

30:06.304 --> 30:07.371
Are you sure?

30:07.372 --> 30:08.539
I can take him with me.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.340
It's better if he stays with us.

30:10.341 --> 30:12.408
It doesn't mean you ould leave.

30:12.409 --> 30:15.477
We've got to work out
this mess of yours.

30:15.478 --> 30:17.177
Victor, I-

30:17.178 --> 30:19.612
I can only offer so many apologies.

30:19.613 --> 30:22.482
Well, to salva a senate
race requires your sacrifice.

30:22.483 --> 30:24.386
Myacrifice?

30:24.387 --> 30:26.557
Something beyond the
one I've already made.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.826
The breach of- - enough, okay.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.095
You're gonna go under
a doctor's care

30:31.096 --> 30:32.663
For mental problems.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.765
Mental problems?

30:34.766 --> 30:36.300
Yeah, you suffer from depression,

30:36.301 --> 30:37.702
Maybe it's bipolar disorder,

30:37.703 --> 30:40.604
But it's what caused
the family crisis.

30:40.605 --> 30:43.541
I'm not sane?

30:43.542 --> 30:45.743
You make aublic statement,

30:45.744 --> 30:47.478
Anyou resign yourself to treatment.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.380
Rick'll never be a part of this.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.882
Like you, he has no other choice.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.023
Where could you go that
we couldn't find you, huh?

31:00.260 --> 31:02.127
Look, don't worry.

31:02.128 --> 31:04.062
Things will begain
as they should be.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.930
You need to show people

31:05.931 --> 31:08.532
That you're sorry for
what you've done.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.200
Now, you are sorry, aren't you?

31:29.425 --> 31:33.193
We totally support our beloved
angela in this time of need.

31:33.194 --> 31:35.696
Angela will tell in her own words

31:35.697 --> 31:40.300
How her actions led
to our son's arrest.

31:41.805 --> 31:44.006
We admire her bravery,

31:44.007 --> 31:45.941
And you will too.

31:45.942 --> 31:49.510
Now, if this means that I
cannot lead this campaign...

31:49.511 --> 31:50.744
No!

31:50.745 --> 31:52.212
If it means that
I cannot rve you,

31:52.213 --> 31:56.782
To meet the needs of my family...

31:56.783 --> 31:59.351
I'm only gonna ask
you for one thing.

31:59.352 --> 32:02.353
That's for your love
and your prayers

32:02.354 --> 32:06.023
For angela and our son
in this time of need.

32:09.393 --> 32:11.995
talk about a master of spin.

32:11.996 --> 32:14.764
Victor and angela
covered their tracks well.

32:14.765 --> 32:17.632
Sometimes she registered under
her maiden name, scanlon,

32:17.633 --> 32:20.134
But if he was there, so was she.

32:20.135 --> 32:21.768
Shtupping his son's wife

32:21.769 --> 32:23.103
The whole time
they've been married?

32:23.104 --> 32:25.606
And I voted for this guy.

32:25.607 --> 32:28.241
So ryan foley was
a threat to him,

32:28.242 --> 32:32.077
And he called on nando to
eliminate the competition?

32:32.078 --> 32:33.678
Where does rick
stand in all this?

32:33.679 --> 32:37.581
Was he party to it,
ignorant, or in denial?

32:37.582 --> 32:40.116
Let's offer him a dose
of reality and find out.

32:41.584 --> 32:44.252
I have nothing to say
about ryan foley's death.

32:44.253 --> 32:47.121
And you have an alibi
which covers his activities.

32:47.122 --> 32:49.924
We think ryan foley's death

32:49.925 --> 32:52.294
Resulted from someone
else's feelings for angela,

32:52.295 --> 32:53.562
Not rick's.

32:53.563 --> 32:55.031
Then they should
be here, not him.

32:55.032 --> 32:57.335
Wait. What are you talking about?

32:57.336 --> 33:00.470
How come your father didn't
tell you about angela's affair

33:00.471 --> 33:01.570
With ryan foley?

33:01.571 --> 33:03.539
He didn't know.

33:03.540 --> 33:07.276
We have evidence
that he did know.

33:07.277 --> 33:09.515
Wait. We should confer.

33:09.516 --> 33:11.051
No. I want to hear this.

33:11.052 --> 33:12.719
So what, my father
knew about angela?

33:12.720 --> 33:14.587
Did he think that you couldn't

33:14.588 --> 33:16.394
Take care of your wife's lover?

33:16.395 --> 33:18.363
Not man enough?

33:21.400 --> 33:24.434
Come on, rick, I buy that
you were cuckolded once,

33:24.435 --> 33:28.671
But you had to know about
angela and your father.

33:28.672 --> 33:30.439
My father?

33:30.440 --> 33:32.909
All those trips,
they shared a room.

33:32.910 --> 33:34.513
Okay, yes, I'm not a total idiot.

33:34.514 --> 33:35.814
I know how that looks,

33:35.815 --> 33:37.549
And I raised the issue
with the family.

33:37.550 --> 33:40.351
I am satisfied that nothing,

33:40.352 --> 33:41.819
Absolutely nothing was going on.

33:41.820 --> 33:43.988
Victor was that convincing?

33:43.989 --> 33:45.956
My mother was that convincing.

33:45.957 --> 33:48.759
My father doesn't jump unless
she tells him how high.

33:51.729 --> 33:53.062
Here are times and places

33:53.063 --> 33:55.698
Where your father and angela-
you get the picture.

33:55.699 --> 33:58.767
There's an affidavit
from a hotel clerk,

33:58.768 --> 34:00.803
All during the first
year of your marriage.

34:05.244 --> 34:06.778
That dirty, rotten bastard.

34:08.679 --> 34:11.148
<i>That filthy hijo de-</i>

34:11.149 --> 34:12.815
But you have him?

34:12.817 --> 34:14.284
Wait. We must talk about this.

34:14.284 --> 34:16.487
No. You were his hire, not mine.

34:16.487 --> 34:17.955
I want you out of here. Out!

34:35.036 --> 34:38.606
So is my father going down
for ryan foley's murder?

34:38.607 --> 34:42.708
Tell me that's true.

34:42.710 --> 34:44.746
There's a way to make it true.

34:52.554 --> 34:54.722
The attorney says you fired him.

34:57.960 --> 35:01.061
What are you, in some
scheme with the cops?

35:01.062 --> 35:02.730
You're wearing a wire?

35:02.731 --> 35:05.132
Hello, detectives, you listening?

35:11.240 --> 35:14.008
<i>It's a bad idea to
threaten me, hijo.</i>

35:14.009 --> 35:15.644
I'm not here with a wire.

35:15.645 --> 35:18.579
I'm here for compensation for
the grief you've caused me.

35:18.580 --> 35:20.815
I'm not giving you a dime.

35:20.816 --> 35:23.518
Then I'll be taking
bobby away from you.

35:23.519 --> 35:26.955
Yours is the weak
blood of my own father.

35:26.956 --> 35:29.057
Yeah. A little man,

35:29.058 --> 35:32.227
Who was satisfied teaching
slum children to count pennies.

35:32.228 --> 35:33.895
A man with no vision, no goals.

35:33.896 --> 35:35.864
<i>Stay out of this, mamita.</i>

35:35.865 --> 35:37.899
Our family needs to make peace.

35:37.900 --> 35:38.967
You can't uproot bobby.

35:38.968 --> 35:40.769
He's out of your lives.

35:43.606 --> 35:47.309
Unless...

35:47.310 --> 35:49.144
Well, at this point
it's all about money.

35:49.145 --> 35:51.613
<i>No... Ningun centavo.</i>

35:51.614 --> 35:53.582
<i>El dinero es mio.</i>

35:53.583 --> 35:55.450
Yeah, that's right.

35:55.451 --> 35:57.385
It is your money.

35:57.386 --> 36:00.188
So buy him out of this.

36:06.629 --> 36:08.663
Is 200,000 enough?

36:09.898 --> 36:10.898
More like five.

36:14.303 --> 36:15.770
You'll have it tonight...

36:17.172 --> 36:19.006
After the office closes.

36:21.076 --> 36:24.512
You've suffered, but
someday this will pass.

36:28.450 --> 36:30.852
<i>Somos familia.</i>

37:13.601 --> 37:14.667
Tio nando.

37:26.105 --> 37:28.638
<i>I'm sad you're leaving
our family, sobrino.</i>

37:30.707 --> 37:34.176
Take my word, for
now it's for the best.

37:34.177 --> 37:36.512
I don't understand
that kind of thinking,

37:36.513 --> 37:38.447
But it's your life.

37:41.583 --> 37:43.682
Hey! Put it down!

37:43.683 --> 37:44.983
Put it down.

37:48.754 --> 37:50.021
Now back away from it.

37:50.022 --> 37:52.423
Hands above your
head, turn around.

37:57.461 --> 37:59.128
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:59.129 --> 38:01.797
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

38:01.798 --> 38:03.833
In a court of law...

38:14.108 --> 38:15.374
<i>I blamed you, papito,</i>

38:15.375 --> 38:17.809
But, uh, she's much
harder than I thought.

38:17.810 --> 38:19.343
We've arrested your brother.

38:19.344 --> 38:21.946
Okay, there is no discussion
until I call our lawyer.

38:21.947 --> 38:26.149
Mrs. Caldera, we know why
you wanted your son dead,

38:26.150 --> 38:30.053
And we know why you
ordered your brother

38:30.054 --> 38:31.420
To kill ryan foley.

38:31.421 --> 38:34.823
This empire is yours,
not the senator's.

38:34.824 --> 38:37.258
I will not respond
to any of these accus-

38:46.533 --> 38:50.234
Oh, I see.

38:50.235 --> 38:51.870
The betrayal is now complete.

38:51.871 --> 38:54.306
Angela never betrayed you.

38:54.307 --> 38:56.407
She never broke from your plan.

38:56.408 --> 38:59.043
The official family
bio praises you

38:59.044 --> 39:01.178
For nurturing troubled young women.

39:01.179 --> 39:03.080
You singled out
angela, mentored her.

39:03.081 --> 39:04.614
Yes...

39:04.615 --> 39:06.215
And made her a daughter,

39:06.216 --> 39:07.350
Only to have her shame me.

39:07.351 --> 39:09.518
We know from
angela's phone records

39:09.519 --> 39:11.019
She called you from miami.

39:11.020 --> 39:13.188
So you knew her travel
plans, you called nando,

39:13.189 --> 39:14.823
And had nando kill ryan foley.

39:14.824 --> 39:16.657
This is absurd.

39:16.658 --> 39:19.326
It was important that
angela see ryan's body.

39:19.327 --> 39:23.363
It was a warning that
nobody leaves your fold.

39:23.364 --> 39:27.067
But if you knew I was
sleeping with victor,

39:27.068 --> 39:28.735
Why didn't you want me gone?

39:28.736 --> 39:30.437
To respond is beneath me.

39:30.438 --> 39:32.339
You had to stay, angela.

39:32.340 --> 39:33.607
You're bobby's mother.

39:33.608 --> 39:37.711
Bobby is the son of real promise.

39:37.712 --> 39:40.547
He'll be to the family
all that rick was not.

39:40.548 --> 39:44.384
Angela deserves to know
the more profound reason

39:44.385 --> 39:46.686
Why marta allowed,

39:46.687 --> 39:50.289
In fact, wanted you to seduce her.

39:50.290 --> 39:52.325
She wanted it?

39:52.326 --> 39:54.527
She needed a surrogate.

39:54.528 --> 39:58.565
Somebody compliant, obligated
to be in the family fold.

39:58.566 --> 40:01.468
There's a paternity test...

40:03.271 --> 40:06.207
At the hospital san nicolas.

40:06.208 --> 40:08.509
This is a copy of it.

40:08.510 --> 40:10.978
Requested at bobby's birth...

40:10.979 --> 40:12.813
By marta...

40:14.817 --> 40:19.821
Caldera castillo.

40:19.822 --> 40:24.293
You couldn't give victor more
than one child, could you?

40:30.562 --> 40:32.559
Rick, I'm- rick, I'm so sorry.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.859
Yeah.

40:34.860 --> 40:37.060
We both qualify as damaged goods.

40:37.061 --> 40:38.528
Hear him.

40:38.529 --> 40:41.096
Even now, weakness.

40:41.097 --> 40:45.699
From grammar school, when
he would come home crying,

40:45.700 --> 40:47.366
A cowardly boy,

40:47.367 --> 40:49.634
A victim of bullies,

40:49.635 --> 40:51.836
We knew.

40:51.837 --> 40:54.138
Victor and I knew we had a problem,

40:54.139 --> 40:58.140
And I vowed to resolve it.

40:58.141 --> 41:00.875
Is it so wrong to want a child

41:00.876 --> 41:03.277
To honor the castillo-caldera name?

41:07.649 --> 41:11.819
The crime isn't wanting a son.

41:11.820 --> 41:14.523
The crime is lying and
killing to have one.

41:19.466 --> 41:23.203
Senator, call your lawyer.

41:23.204 --> 41:26.209
You're gonna be surrendering
at centre street.

41:46.299 --> 41:49.100
Get in.
