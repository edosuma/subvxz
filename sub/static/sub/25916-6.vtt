00:06.006 --> 00:08.925
[theme music playing]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.428
[man] <i>Hey!</i>

00:40.373 --> 00:42.375
Next to present their bountiful harvest

00:42.459 --> 00:45.587
for His Majesty's blessing
and immediate confiscation,

00:45.670 --> 00:49.507
he's a farmer with six teeth.
She's his wife with none.

00:49.591 --> 00:52.510
Ole and Alice!

00:53.178 --> 00:57.182
-That is wheat, Your Highness. Wheat.
-What?

00:57.265 --> 00:58.141
-Wheat.
-What?

00:58.224 --> 00:59.309
-Wheat.
-What?

00:59.392 --> 01:00.310
-Wheat.
-What?

01:00.393 --> 01:01.519
-Wheat.
-What?

01:01.603 --> 01:02.604
-Wheat.
-What?

01:02.687 --> 01:05.482
Ah, I'm just screwing with you,
liven things up a little.

01:05.565 --> 01:06.775
Gimme the thing, will you?

01:06.858 --> 01:11.821
Blessings to you, from your greasy hair
to your filthy, ripped-up shoes.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.699
-Those are his feet, Your Highness.
-Those are feet?

01:14.783 --> 01:17.494
Well, it's understandable.
They are leathery.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.788
Plus, there's laces holdin' the skin on.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.331
Next!

01:21.414 --> 01:26.503
Tedrick the shepherd and Daisy,
the one sheep you haven't eaten yet.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.881
I made you the biggest,
itchiest wool sweater I could,

01:29.964 --> 01:32.675
but if it's too snug, you can give it
to your fat, wimpy son.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.595
Eh, we'll give it to Bean.

01:35.678 --> 01:38.264
She doesn't care at all
about her appearance.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.392
Bean, thank this nice creep
so he'll move along.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.560
Where'd she go?

01:42.644 --> 01:45.480
She said if I told you,
she'd hurt Mr. Bear.

01:45.563 --> 01:46.856
What?

01:46.940 --> 01:48.108
[grunts in frustration]

01:48.191 --> 01:52.946
I only ask that girl to do two things:
Sit here and stay sober.

01:53.029 --> 01:56.241
And she never does neither.
Gimme my damn scepter.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.326
[grunting]

02:01.996 --> 02:03.289
[all gasp]

02:05.250 --> 02:06.751
Nice toss, Dad.

02:06.835 --> 02:10.004
-Next round's on Zog.
-[all cheer]

02:10.588 --> 02:14.425
-And give this guy a double.
-Oh, well, aren't you sweet?

02:19.430 --> 02:20.640
[grunts]

02:20.723 --> 02:23.685
Okay, okay, okay, I got one. Who's this?

02:23.768 --> 02:26.604
[groans] "I got killed by a chair."

02:26.688 --> 02:29.816
Oh, oh, oh. One of your fiancés?
That guy you murdered?

02:29.899 --> 02:32.527
What's-his-name,
the Forgettable... Guysbert.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.529
Ding, ding, ding! Whoo!

02:34.612 --> 02:37.782
Okay, me next, chumps.
[clears throat]

02:38.283 --> 02:42.120
"I'm a big, fat king,
and I'm married to a salamander, and my daughter
has a dangerous drinking problem."

02:46.124 --> 02:47.417
Zog! Drink!

02:48.084 --> 02:51.588
Me next. Me next. Guess who this is.
[clears throat]

02:52.172 --> 02:53.756
"Hi, I'm Elfo."

02:53.840 --> 02:54.757
Ooh, ooh, I know.

02:54.841 --> 02:58.428
The guy with the goofy shoes,
reeks of flop sweat and licorice...

02:58.511 --> 03:01.848
Oh, he's really annoying.
What's his name? I wanna say Quelfo?

03:01.931 --> 03:06.436
[chuckles] Not even close.
It's me. I'm Elfo.

03:06.519 --> 03:10.231
Good try? Let's drink anyway, right?

03:10.315 --> 03:11.733
[hammering in distance]

03:12.483 --> 03:13.818
-Hay man.
-What?

03:13.902 --> 03:15.820
No, they've almost finished the hay man.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.739
-What? The hay man?
-What the hey, man?

03:17.822 --> 03:20.491
I'm talking about the hay man
for the harvest bonfire.

03:20.575 --> 03:25.496
It's the best night of the year,
but Zog never lets me go.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.041
He doesn't trust me 'cause he thinks
I'm just a dumb kid.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.251
That's so sad you never get to go.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.338
No, no, I go every year.
He just never lets me.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.507
Hmm. I can't quite figure out
why he doesn't trust you.

03:36.591 --> 03:40.595
All right, we got a big day tomorrow.
Let's grab one last drink for the road.

03:45.850 --> 03:49.187
[Bean] It's drunk and I'm late.
We better sneak in quietly.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.277
[climbing rope]

03:56.361 --> 03:58.321
[breathing heavily]

03:58.404 --> 03:59.364
[grunts]

03:59.447 --> 04:03.743
Oh, floor, you're always there for me.
So supportive.

04:03.826 --> 04:07.997
Not like walls and staircases,
always getting in my way.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.376
[Zog] Oh, Beanie, you're a no-good,
drunken disgrace.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.753
And in this kingdom,
that's sayin' something.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.381
[Elfo] So, now you're telling me your tail
has a mind of its own?

04:16.464 --> 04:19.634
'Cause before, you said it was prehensile.
So, just saying.

04:19.717 --> 04:20.885
[Luci] Shh, shh, shh. Shut up.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.137
-Bean's getting yelled at by her dad.
-Ow!

04:23.221 --> 04:26.391
You ran off from your royal duties
to get drunk.

04:26.474 --> 04:30.979
Oh, so, you noticed? You weren't too busy
with your new family?

04:31.062 --> 04:33.481
New? I've been remarried for years.

04:33.564 --> 04:36.985
And since that time, I've become
less and less important to you.

04:37.068 --> 04:40.613
You barely noticed when I traded places
with that pauper for a year.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.116
[groans] What do you want from me?

04:43.199 --> 04:46.911
I'd like to have a role to play
in your life, in the kingdom.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.579
I'm tired of feeling useless.

04:49.706 --> 04:53.918
Ah, Beanie, it's so hard to know
what to do without yellin'.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.003
[groans]

04:56.713 --> 04:58.923
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

05:03.344 --> 05:08.224
I don't see problem. Your daughter
feel useless because she is useless.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.350
But she's hurtin'.

05:09.434 --> 05:13.354
Her purpose is to be married off
to unite kingdoms, like we do.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.231
Make offspring, like Derek.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.775
I can't sleep with Mr. Bear like this.

05:17.859 --> 05:21.195
Vip, Vap, escort Derek
back to his room, huh.

05:21.863 --> 05:25.825
I don't know. I don't want Bean
to be unhappy. Can't we throw her a bone?

05:25.908 --> 05:29.037
Well, sire, we do have
the upcoming trip to Dankmire,

05:29.120 --> 05:31.581
but it's a rather delicate
diplomatic mission.

05:31.664 --> 05:36.210
Perfect. Give her some phony-baloney job
with a fancy title and a sash.

05:38.087 --> 05:40.965
Aren't ambassadorships usually
just given to rich chumps

05:41.049 --> 05:42.425
to make them feel important?

05:42.508 --> 05:46.137
Yeah, and it's working.
Express boat to Dankmire.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.156
Ugh. Tourists.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.246
[Elfo] We're almost there.

06:12.330 --> 06:16.000
I'm so excited,
my skin is breaking out in sprinkles.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.337
-Those're mosquito bites.
-I'm scratching with excitement. Hey, hey, peewee, no bleeding.
Your blood belongs to me.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.426
Oh, this is so interesting.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.471
Did you know Dreamland forced Dankmire
to build this canal?

06:28.554 --> 06:31.307
Then, they fought a 100-year war
over who owns the canal,

06:31.391 --> 06:35.853
and the war only ended when a certain
King Zog of Dreamland, your dad,

06:35.937 --> 06:40.400
married Princess Oona of Dankmire.
That's your weird stepmom.

06:40.483 --> 06:41.984
Yeah, I remember their wedding.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.195
I got jealous and put a dead owl
in their cake.

06:44.278 --> 06:48.282
-People, like, ate the whole thing.
-Hey! That's in here, too.

07:04.882 --> 07:08.928
-Wow! Beautiful.
-Oona, you grew up here.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.930
Can you just tell me about this place,

07:11.013 --> 07:13.266
and I'll try to decipher your accent?

07:13.349 --> 07:18.354
Don't worry. Every visitor to Dankmire
receives a famously warm welcome.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.486
-You are two minutes late.
-[all grunt]

07:25.570 --> 07:28.781
"Warm refers to
the sweltering temperature,

07:28.865 --> 07:31.659
not the notoriously grim locals."

07:31.742 --> 07:34.036
Hmm, this is where Oona gets
her sense of humor.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.165
Is true. I was class clown.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.791
Is joke.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.126
Or is?

07:44.005 --> 07:46.549
-"Dankmirians love protocol."
-[all grunt]

07:46.632 --> 07:50.094
"They consider it rude to bow
without bowing first."

07:50.178 --> 07:52.889
-I can tell this place already sucks--
-...ceeds at... -Blowing--
-...away our expectations.

07:55.766 --> 07:59.312
Your Highness,
on behalf of all of Dreamland,

07:59.395 --> 08:04.150
may I just say thank you
for this charming reception.

08:04.233 --> 08:07.153
-And we thank you for your thank you.
-[all grunt]

08:08.571 --> 08:10.072
-[Luci grunts]
-[all grunt]

08:10.156 --> 08:11.491
[Luci chuckles]

08:12.033 --> 08:12.950
[grunts]

08:13.034 --> 08:17.538
Hey, hey, now that's diplomacy.
Show us what else you got.

08:17.622 --> 08:21.083
Mr. Chancellor, we are at your disposal

08:21.167 --> 08:25.588
and keen to experience more
of your local culture. What's next?

08:25.671 --> 08:29.175
-A play, in 16 acts.
-Ah.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.718
Performed by children.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.553
[laughs]

08:33.262 --> 08:35.348
Yay!

08:39.435 --> 08:43.272
Hey, fish, that peanut butter
on my tail was mine. [grunts]

08:43.356 --> 08:46.776
Stupid fish, always takin'
my precious body butters.

08:57.078 --> 09:01.457
It's taken centuries, but our civilization
has literally risen out of the muck

09:01.541 --> 09:04.961
to have one of the finest
community playhouses around.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.295
[Zog groans]

09:06.379 --> 09:10.800
Oh, uh, that's our way of saying "hmm."

09:11.384 --> 09:13.010
[chomps] Hmm.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.389
You will love this play
about our glorious canal.

09:16.472 --> 09:19.016
This thing better not be a musical.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.018
No, but it is one of those plays

09:21.102 --> 09:23.729
where the actors come out
into the audience and bother people.

09:23.813 --> 09:28.401
Ooh-hoo-hoo! That's the only kinda play
we have in Hell. [vocalizing]

09:31.821 --> 09:35.575
You cannot stop Dankmirian progress,
swamp people.

09:35.658 --> 09:40.454
Now stop complaining,
and build us the world's cleanest canal.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.790
[boy] This means war.

09:46.669 --> 09:47.878
[grunting]

09:47.962 --> 09:48.838
[boy] Shut up.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.804
And thus, the 500-year war was over,

09:56.887 --> 10:01.183
and Dankmire and Dreamland
share the beautiful canal

10:01.267 --> 10:03.769
and the marriage of convenience.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.522
Who's that fat kid with the crown
supposed to be?

10:06.606 --> 10:09.525
All hail Dankmire.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.361
Thank you for coming.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.657
What the hell was that?

10:16.741 --> 10:19.201
They're acting like we didn't contribute
to that canal.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.204
As ambassador, I have to remind you

10:22.288 --> 10:25.041
to not act like a caveman.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.668
-Say something nice.
-No.

10:27.752 --> 10:33.507
On behalf of Dreamland,
I'd like to say that that was a fine show.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.761
That husky kid's a real tour de force.

10:36.844 --> 10:37.845
[chancellor grunts]

10:38.763 --> 10:40.348
All right, you did good.

10:40.431 --> 10:44.685
Covering up the indiscretions of those
in power is an important part of the job.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.605
Why don't you give the big speech
at tonight's banquet?

10:47.688 --> 10:49.649
What? Me? Speech?

10:49.732 --> 10:53.736
I've never written a speech before.
I guess I could try.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.946
You'll do great, as long as you remember

10:56.030 --> 10:59.909
our entire flimsy alliance
depends on it going perfect.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.161
-Oh.
-Okay, good things.

11:02.244 --> 11:05.373
You're a great writer.
I've read your diary.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.167
Uh... [chuckles]
I showed him where you hid it.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.591
[Elfo and Luci slurping]

11:15.675 --> 11:20.096
Everything is riding on this speech.
Luckily, Dad gave me his notes.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.390
"Wing it"?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.351
[groans]

11:26.769 --> 11:27.728
[Elfo and Luci slurping]

11:27.812 --> 11:31.565
Hey, welcome to Muddruckers. I'm Chazz.
Would you like to order a drink?

11:31.649 --> 11:34.360
Or you want to keep working
on that decorative centerpiece?

11:34.944 --> 11:36.362
[fly buzzing]

11:36.445 --> 11:39.573
[slurps] Uh, what's your specialty?

11:39.657 --> 11:42.993
Passive aggressive sarcasm.
[chuckles] Just kidding.

11:43.077 --> 11:46.330
You got Chazz'd.
I'll bring you what you deserve.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.374
Just soda for me!

11:48.457 --> 11:49.792
I'm on a deadline.

11:50.376 --> 11:56.340
When in the course of human events...
No, that's stupid, stupid.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.593
Love is... Oh, my gosh, I can't do this.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.595
I'm never gonna be able to do this.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.098
I've known a lot of writers.
Most of 'em go to Hell.

12:04.181 --> 12:08.728
And the one surefire way to unleash your
creative juice is with creative juice.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.271
No. No alcohol.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.691
Lucille, stop it.
You're being a bad influence.

12:13.774 --> 12:16.569
Hey, I'm an enabler.
There's a big difference.

12:16.652 --> 12:20.823
Here you go.
Booze, booze and boring.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.491
Ooh, what is this?

12:22.575 --> 12:25.119
Extra-strong Dankmirian Schnapps.

12:25.202 --> 12:28.581
One shot is all you need.
So, I brought you two.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.254
See? I don't even miss the alcohol.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.812
Where the hell is Bean?
I got a lot riding on that girl.

12:51.896 --> 12:56.025
[stammering] She... No... She's... Who?

12:56.108 --> 12:57.902
She's here. Take it away, Bean.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.987
-[Bean burps]
-[all gasp]

13:00.070 --> 13:00.988
[moans]

13:02.406 --> 13:04.825
Her ceremonial robe. It's backwards.

13:06.202 --> 13:10.247
[slurring] Whoops-a-daisies.
Let me give it a spinneroo.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.042
Whoo! How do you like me now?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.794
Aw, jeez. What are you doing?

13:17.004 --> 13:20.382
-What happened to you?
-It's not her fault.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.967
That's right. It's your fault.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.385
-You didn't stop me.
-[gasps]

13:23.469 --> 13:28.349
You should be proud of me, Dad.
I finished my speech and all the nachos.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.018
You're in no shape to deliver any speech.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.604
-Sit down and shut up.
-[Bean groans]

13:33.687 --> 13:35.856
I'll get Derek to give the speech.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.984
He's part Dankmirian.
At least he appeals to someone.

13:39.068 --> 13:43.322
What? You're gonna entrust
the future of our kingdom to that twerp?

13:43.405 --> 13:46.158
Considering that twerp
is heir apparent to the throne

13:46.242 --> 13:49.995
on whom the future of our kingdom
already rests, yeah.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.247
[bell rings]

13:51.330 --> 13:52.665
Let us feast.

13:52.748 --> 13:57.253
We'll begin with the traditional
Dankmirian dish, Lamprey Vivant.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.337
Whoa!

13:58.420 --> 14:01.131
Eh, teenagers... [chuckling]

14:01.215 --> 14:04.260
Unless it's a boiled pear,
they're not interested.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.847
Go on now. Down the hatch.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.517
[Bean] I can do it. I can do it.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.601
[shrieks]

14:12.685 --> 14:13.811
[exclaims]

14:13.894 --> 14:16.605
-Look who's enjoying their dinner.
-[Derek grunting]

14:16.689 --> 14:19.775
[slurps and gulps]

14:19.859 --> 14:22.736
Listen, boy, your sister
is a little under the weather.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.196
And under the table.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.533
So, why don't you stand up
and say a few words?

14:27.616 --> 14:30.160
Who, me? But I don't know how to--

14:30.244 --> 14:32.705
Just butter 'em up with a nice toast.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.456
Okay, I'll try.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.333
[clears throat]

14:36.417 --> 14:40.963
Hello, there. My name is
Bonnie Prince Derek of Dreamland.

14:41.046 --> 14:45.259
I am here tonight to
butter your nice toast. Right, Dad?

14:45.342 --> 14:47.970
-[groans]
-Except I don't know how to.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.306
My nanny always does it for me.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.683
Sometimes, I like marmalade, too.

14:53.183 --> 14:57.062
Have you ever had apple butter?
That's something I might also have.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.690
Uh-oh. I'll save you, bro.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.317
[all gasp]

15:01.400 --> 15:05.613
[slurring] Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the Honorable Ambassador Tiabeanie Mariabeanie
De La Rochambeaux Drunkowitz.

15:09.992 --> 15:13.162
Remember the name. Remember the face.

15:13.245 --> 15:17.249
Remember that time you had that play
and my dad was the fat kid?

15:17.333 --> 15:19.251
That was awesome.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.922
I'm so sorry that we had that long war.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.465
I mean, that sucked.

15:24.548 --> 15:28.636
But I think we can all agree one thing:

15:28.719 --> 15:30.471
We kicked your asses.

15:30.554 --> 15:31.805
[all gasp]

15:31.889 --> 15:35.643
Hey, look at this.
I got sleeves like a bat.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.854
-[Bean vocalizing]
-[all gasp]

15:38.938 --> 15:40.814
[Luci] Hey, Bat Bean, fly over here.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.316
[continues vocalizing]

15:44.818 --> 15:48.405
Watch it. Watch out, or I'm gonna...

15:48.489 --> 15:50.115
[vocalizes]

15:50.199 --> 15:51.617
Ooh! Hang upside down.

15:51.700 --> 15:57.247
Uh, so, in conclusion, Dreamland
never had a better friend than Dankmire,

15:57.331 --> 15:59.375
-and I hope that never changes.
-[queen shrieks]

16:00.376 --> 16:02.920
-[Bean laughing]
-[all gasp]

16:03.754 --> 16:04.755
[all gasp loudly]

16:04.838 --> 16:07.007
[Bean] Wearing dresses is hard.

16:07.091 --> 16:11.845
Pay no attention to the naked ambassador
on the chandelier.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.264
-[Bean burps and vomits]
-[chancellor] Ew!

16:14.348 --> 16:15.432
Oh, boy.

16:17.559 --> 16:20.521
Uh, let me... [gags]
Let me help you clean that.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.106
[gags]

16:22.189 --> 16:24.984
-I'm gonna--
-Stop. You're just smearing it around.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.276
This is an outrage.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.529
By appointing Ambassador Tiabeanie,

16:28.612 --> 16:31.615
you've told us everything we need to know
about our alliance.

16:31.699 --> 16:35.661
-It is over. This is war! Again.
-[Bean grunts]

16:35.744 --> 16:38.372
Guards! Busboys! Seize them!

16:38.455 --> 16:40.958
-[Bean] No! No, no, no, no.
-[all protest]

16:45.421 --> 16:47.131
Come on. This way.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.676
How did you know that was there?

16:50.759 --> 16:53.178
Uh, unlike some people,
I read the guidebook.

17:00.269 --> 17:03.856
Just once could we go on a family vacation
without having to run away screaming?

17:07.609 --> 17:09.611
Hold them off while I untie the barge.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.613
I'll stop those jerks
dead in their tracks.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.284
Here goes nothing.

Quickly, the lock.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.024
[grunting]

17:55.783 --> 17:56.867
[all scream]

17:58.327 --> 17:59.244
[grunting]

18:02.247 --> 18:04.249
I'll see you at home!

18:04.333 --> 18:06.668
Mommy, I'm afraid!

18:06.752 --> 18:11.006
-[Oona] Just stay close to your father!
-That's why I'm afraid.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.259
[all scream]

18:14.343 --> 18:16.345
[Dankmirians grunting]

18:18.263 --> 18:23.185
Great job, Bean. I hope you can sense
my sarcasm through your drunken haze.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.646
Yeah, yeah, I stink.
Derek, get on Dad's back.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.023
[Derek and Zog groan]

18:31.902 --> 18:33.112
I'll get you!

18:33.695 --> 18:34.696
Unless you keep going.

18:34.780 --> 18:38.117
-[guard 1] Shall we jump in after them?
-[guard 2] Please say no. Please say no.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.620
No need. They're heading deep
into muskrat territory.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.289
The swamp monster will take care of them.

18:44.373 --> 18:48.127
[guard 1] Aw.
Oh, that kind of "take care of them."

18:50.838 --> 18:52.714
[Derek] And as we trudged
through the swamp,

18:52.798 --> 18:56.552
I began to realize
my clothes had grown muddy.

18:56.635 --> 19:01.014
Hey! I told you
to stop narrating your memoirs.

19:01.098 --> 19:05.435
Man, I really blew it. I was crazy
to think I could be an ambassador.

19:05.519 --> 19:08.355
This is why I always tell you
not to try things.

19:08.438 --> 19:12.067
-Stop it. You're too discouraging.
-You're too encouraging.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.570
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you do something about it?

19:14.653 --> 19:16.780
Come on. I'm encouraging you.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.448
Ow! [grunting]

19:20.492 --> 19:22.953
Oh! Ah! Ah! Stop it!

19:24.371 --> 19:26.039
You're not even a little nice.

19:26.123 --> 19:29.209
You know what you are?
You're bad through and through,

19:29.293 --> 19:32.754
from the tip of your pointy tail
to the tips of your pointy ears.

19:32.838 --> 19:36.216
Ho, ho! You wanna come at me
about some pointy ears?

19:36.300 --> 19:37.843
Have you ever seen your reflection?

19:38.927 --> 19:39.887
Oh, my God.

19:40.470 --> 19:41.889
I'm a freak.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.682

-[grunts]

19:43.765 --> 19:45.767
[both grunting]

19:46.894 --> 19:51.064
Stop it. Stop.
You both have super weird ears. [groans]

19:51.565 --> 19:54.818
Oh, this log is hard. I miss my tuffet.

19:54.902 --> 19:58.280
-You miss your tuffet, do you?
-Oh, ever so much.

19:58.363 --> 20:02.784
And your pet swans?
And your little sled for your toy bear?

20:02.868 --> 20:04.119
Do you miss those?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.205
-Uh-huh.
-Aw.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.665
Get down there and dig a pit
for us to sleep in.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.083
'Kay. [yelps]

20:10.167 --> 20:13.253
Keep quiet,
if y'all know what's good for y'all.

20:13.337 --> 20:17.674
You boys waltzed into the wrong swamp.
You our property now.

20:17.758 --> 20:23.347
Property? Men don't own me. I own men.
I'm King Zog!

20:23.847 --> 20:24.765
Zog?

20:24.848 --> 20:27.851
-Ain't you the king from Dreamland?
-Indeed, I am.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.062
[laughing]

20:30.145 --> 20:34.066
We gonna have some
king-sized fun with you, boy.

[Derek yelps]

20:35.901 --> 20:37.903
[grunting]

20:38.737 --> 20:39.738
I've had it.

20:39.821 --> 20:44.243
The next one of you who lays a hand
on the other one gets left behind, okay?

20:44.326 --> 20:45.410
Ow!

20:45.494 --> 20:46.912
Congratulations, guys.

20:46.995 --> 20:50.791
You're the first people in history to make
me say, "I'd rather be with my dad."

20:52.918 --> 20:53.877
Dad?

20:59.633 --> 21:02.636
What do you want? Gold? Jewels?

21:02.719 --> 21:04.388
Here, here, take my crown.

21:04.471 --> 21:09.893
Yeah, I reckon we don't want none of that.
We just wanna even the score.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.853
The score? What did I do?

21:11.937 --> 21:16.358
I know it's you what built that canal.
It drove me and all my kin off our land.

21:16.441 --> 21:19.820
Come on. It wasn't my fault.
I was just giving orders.

21:19.903 --> 21:24.199
Orders? Coincidentally,
we about to cook up an order...

21:25.284 --> 21:30.289
of king à la king and grilled shrimpy.
No, I'm kidding.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.582
We just gonna fry y'all up in some butter. [Derek and Zog whimper]

21:34.960 --> 21:38.338
-Don't worry. We ain't gonna eat you.
-I knew that.

21:38.422 --> 21:42.050
We're cooking y'all up
for the swamp monster.

Skinny girl? Kitty cat? Gross baby?

Elfo, Luci, let's show these yokels
how we city folk do things.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.635
I never thought these little ones
would come in handy.

Since y'all was screamin' like babies
in the frying pan, we gone to plan B:

Feed you to the monster raw.

No! No!

22:42.694 --> 22:44.404
[muffled grunting]

Don't be rude, Dad. Let's respect
the customs of our colorful hosts.

22:50.160 --> 22:56.500
May I propose a toast? I got some
low-grade pocket hooch in my booty flask.

Please accept it as a gift
from my kingdom to your... this.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.681
Oh. That's right kindly of you.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.308
I guess maybe there's a world

23:13.392 --> 23:16.686
where I could let y'all go,
and we could be friends.

23:17.354 --> 23:20.065
Yeah. Hey, both you hicks, drink up.

23:20.148 --> 23:21.566

23:21.650 --> 23:24.861
I believe he called us hicks, Slim.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.947
Oh, he should not have done that.

23:27.030 --> 23:30.617
I should've knowed it.
All you royals are the same.

You know what we'll do when we get home?

25:38.995 --> 25:41.289
-We're gonna bury the bear.
-[Derek] Okay.

25:41.373 --> 25:45.043
[Zog] In fact, we can get
a whole toy graveyard goin'.

25:45.126 --> 25:48.880
We can do it together.
Or, better yet, have the servants do it.

25:48.964 --> 25:53.343
[Derek] Yeah, we've had a rough day.
Maybe we could just go to bed?

25:53.426 --> 25:57.430
Oh, I'm gonna have bad dreams
about that skillet.

25:57.514 --> 26:01.685
Oh. Man, that thing was huge.
[sighs in relief]
