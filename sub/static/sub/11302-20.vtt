00:16.685 --> 00:17.769
Hey, Bennett.

00:18.978 --> 00:20.313
Hey, Phillips.

00:20.396 --> 00:22.273
I thought your dad
hated Christmas lights.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.775
Oh, yeah, he does.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.027
That's half the fun of hanging 'em up.

00:27.571 --> 00:29.656
I'm like the Cratchit to his Scrooge.

00:31.157 --> 00:33.367
I am impressed. You've
been reading more Dickens?

00:34.744 --> 00:35.745
What?

00:36.746 --> 00:38.957
Dickens wrote <i>The
Muppet Christmas Carol?</i>

00:41.084 --> 00:42.251
Yes.

00:43.127 --> 00:44.378
What are you doing here?

00:44.462 --> 00:48.091
I know you have a lot going on with
your dad and Rooster gone and...

00:48.174 --> 00:49.217
missed you.

00:51.761 --> 00:53.429
- [Abby chuckling]
- I miss you, too.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.098
[both] Mmm.

00:55.181 --> 00:57.350
Plus, I need you to put
the snow chains on my tires

00:57.433 --> 00:59.435
'cause there's a storm
coming in. So, chop-chop.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.187
[both chuckle]

01:02.606 --> 01:05.149
Give you an extra 20 bucks if
you show me your plumber's crack.

01:07.986 --> 01:09.779
What do you got in that brown paper bag?

01:09.863 --> 01:11.530
A little early Christmas present?

01:11.615 --> 01:14.533
I wouldn't give you your Christmas
present in a brown paper bag.

01:15.577 --> 01:17.621
Right, that's... Me neither.

01:19.623 --> 01:21.583
You know you don't
have to get me anything?

01:21.666 --> 01:22.792
I know.

01:22.876 --> 01:24.854
You also know that's something
people just say, right?

01:24.878 --> 01:26.671
You obviously have to get me something.

01:26.755 --> 01:29.758
[chuckling] I know. I
already got you something.

01:29.841 --> 01:31.550
- Yeah? [Chuckles]
- And it's awesome.

01:31.635 --> 01:33.928
But, you know, let's say I didn't,

01:34.012 --> 01:35.412
what do you think would be awesome?

01:36.806 --> 01:38.599
- Or easy to buy?
- [chuckles]

01:40.184 --> 01:41.978
All right.

01:42.061 --> 01:45.439
I got coffee and donuts for you,

01:45.523 --> 01:47.525
and mimosas for me...

01:47.609 --> 01:51.863
'cause it is winter break and
Ms. Phillips don't give a fuck!

01:51.946 --> 01:53.364
[Colt chuckles]

01:53.447 --> 01:55.533
- Yeah, you're a real wild one.
- [chuckling]

01:55.617 --> 01:58.220
Coming down the driveway at five
mile an hour with your hazards on.

01:58.244 --> 02:00.038
Like I said, winter break. Whoo-hoo!

02:00.121 --> 02:01.164
[Colt laughs]

02:01.247 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, well, ranchers
don't get a winter break.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.293
So you don't want a mimosa?

02:05.376 --> 02:08.253
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. I didn't say that.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.190
Just put it in my thermos
so my dad don't see it.

02:10.214 --> 02:12.383
Your dad sees you drink all the time.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.344
Yeah, beer and whiskey. Not mimosas.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.557
How're you two getting along?

02:20.391 --> 02:21.643
[grunts]

02:22.644 --> 02:23.645
Pretty good.

02:24.603 --> 02:27.899
Although Rooster came by last night...

02:29.108 --> 02:31.653
offered me a job in front of my dad.

02:31.736 --> 02:32.737
Oh, shit.

02:32.821 --> 02:34.906
Rooster gonna have an
open or closed casket?

02:34.989 --> 02:36.490
[chuckles] Yeah.

02:37.701 --> 02:39.243
What are you gonna do?

02:40.369 --> 02:42.997
After coming back, it's
hard to imagine leaving.

02:45.083 --> 02:46.960
- This is home.
- Yeah.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.880
I always pictured my kids...

02:52.131 --> 02:54.217
growing up here like I did.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.260
You know, limited adult supervision.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.137
[Abby chuckles]

02:58.221 --> 03:00.890
Plenty of access to
whiskey and firearms.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.102
It's the American dream.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.937
Fuck Canada!

03:07.856 --> 03:09.065
What do you think I should do?

03:09.148 --> 03:12.276
[scoffs] It's not about what I think.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.279
Sure it is. It's our future.

03:16.447 --> 03:17.782
Aw, that's sweet.

03:17.866 --> 03:19.617
There's like three mimosas in here.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.740
You don't have to work that
hard to get me into bed.

03:25.456 --> 03:26.665
It would be kinda cool...

03:28.042 --> 03:29.585
living here with you...

03:31.295 --> 03:32.797
raising a family.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.424
It'd be great.

03:35.508 --> 03:38.469
You can teach 'em the
importance of school.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.263
I'll teach 'em how to
ditch it. [Chuckles]

03:43.307 --> 03:45.018
Well, whatever you decide...

03:46.019 --> 03:47.478
I'm gonna be right there with you.

03:52.901 --> 03:56.070
Unless I die when my truck slides
into a ditch 'cause I got no chains.

03:58.072 --> 04:00.324
All right, I'm on it. [Grunts]

04:01.910 --> 04:04.537
- You gonna help?
- Didn't you hear what I said?

04:04.620 --> 04:06.790
Ms. Phillips is on a break,
she don't give a fuck.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.377
Now, show me that ass.

04:14.839 --> 04:16.673
Whoo! Yes!

04:19.135 --> 04:21.137

06:03.739 --> 06:05.158
Holy shit.

06:10.955 --> 06:13.166
What the fuck's on your feet?

06:14.625 --> 06:17.336
I tripped and stepped right in 'em.

06:19.463 --> 06:22.425
Well, don't stretch 'em
out. They cost 170 bucks.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.802
A hundred and seventy dollars?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.429
That's a fucking...

06:26.512 --> 06:27.846
great price.

06:31.267 --> 06:33.436
Hey, uh, Dad, I need to talk to you.

06:34.062 --> 06:35.896
Colt, I'm having a moment.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.108
Don't ruin it.

06:42.278 --> 06:43.947
I'm not gonna take
that job with Rooster.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.659
I can't leave you.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.331
You're my dad. And even
though we got our problems...

06:54.832 --> 06:55.833
I love you.

06:57.126 --> 06:59.963
I love this place, and me and
Abby is gonna raise our kids here.

07:01.505 --> 07:04.717
Now, I know it hasn't always
meant that much to me, but...

07:05.843 --> 07:08.930
now that I'm back, I think I
realize how important it is.

07:09.931 --> 07:13.267
I just want it to stay in our
family for generations to come.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.770
We're selling the ranch.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.318
Because of what I just said?

07:27.490 --> 07:30.409
Your mother wants me to
leave it to you and Rooster.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.495
I'm only willing to leave it to you.

07:34.998 --> 07:38.542
[stammers] Hold on, you're wearing my
Uggs and now you wanna leave me the ranch?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.419
What the hell's going on here?

07:42.838 --> 07:45.216
If I don't give in to her
demands, we have to sell.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.759
[stammers]

07:46.842 --> 07:49.303
Come on, this is insane.
Just give her what she wants.

07:49.387 --> 07:52.265
I don't negotiate with terrorists.

07:53.932 --> 07:59.022
So you're willing to give all
this up just to prove a point?

08:00.273 --> 08:01.482
Colt...

08:02.816 --> 08:05.069
I appreciate you wanting to stay...

08:07.905 --> 08:09.615
but it's in your mother's hands now.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.455
You're just gonna walk away?

08:16.539 --> 08:17.831
We're done talking.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.833
No, you're still wearing my Uggs!

08:23.754 --> 08:25.881
[chuckles] Okay, watch this video.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.635
Watch what this guy uses
to hit this ping pong ball.

08:31.095 --> 08:33.889
- Oh, shit, he uses his dick!
- [chuckling]

08:33.972 --> 08:35.558
That's awesome.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.559
I could do that.

08:37.643 --> 08:41.397
<i>Gallo, Gallo...</i>
you're like a brother to me.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.167
But physically, you're
like a little brother.

08:43.191 --> 08:46.444
[scoffs] You don't think so?
All right, grab that tangerine.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.861
Throw it at my junk.

08:49.613 --> 08:50.864
[grunting]

08:53.742 --> 08:55.411
Hey, Rooster.

08:55.494 --> 08:56.954
[chuckling] Your pants are down.

08:57.038 --> 08:58.497
How's babysitting going?

08:59.415 --> 09:01.042
Uh, it's not what it looks like.

09:01.125 --> 09:04.295
Unless it looks like I am
throwing a tangerine at his penis.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.882
Generally, we just read
to the baby, but, okay.

09:10.008 --> 09:13.137
So, what's going on here? You
drank six beers and cleaned up zero?

09:13.221 --> 09:15.056
What? No, um...

09:15.139 --> 09:17.266
we've been making a mobile for the baby.

09:17.350 --> 09:18.351
[clattering]

09:18.434 --> 09:21.145
You know, I should put Kiera down.

09:21.229 --> 09:22.646
[Umberto] Yes. Ah, let me help you.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.566
Darlene, do you enjoy making babies?

09:28.777 --> 09:30.113
[clears throat]

09:30.696 --> 09:32.073
All right, we need to talk.

09:32.156 --> 09:33.282
Yeah, sorry about that.

09:33.366 --> 09:35.594
We were gonna clean up, but I
didn't think you'd be back so soon.

09:35.618 --> 09:36.785
Yeah, it's not just that.

09:36.869 --> 09:39.872
Or the fact you were about
to dick slap our produce.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.832
No, it's, um... Listen.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.503
I am barely keeping it
together as it is, okay?

09:45.586 --> 09:47.064
I work 50 hours a week
at the Cracker Barrel.

09:47.088 --> 09:48.648
I got both my daughters living with me.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.800
And baby Kiera, and my
grandson Luke during the week.

09:51.884 --> 09:53.344
I already have a full house.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.804
I do not think I can
take a fuller house.

09:58.891 --> 09:59.975
Oh, shit.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.060
But if we have any shot
at a future together,

10:02.145 --> 10:04.855
you have got to get the fuck out
of my house before I kill you.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.816
[chuckles] All right.

10:09.235 --> 10:10.569
I respect that.

10:11.862 --> 10:14.657
I can, uh, you know... I'll just
crash at Berto's or something.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.034
[sighs] Thank you, thank you, thank you.

10:19.245 --> 10:20.621
Phew! All right, well...

10:20.704 --> 10:23.124
Let me help clean up, I'll
grab Berto and get out of here.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.293
Okay, before you go...

10:26.210 --> 10:27.396
let's see if you can do this thing.

10:27.420 --> 10:28.796
[chuckles] All right.

10:33.384 --> 10:35.303
I just don't think you
should compare yourself

10:35.386 --> 10:37.054
to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

10:37.138 --> 10:41.016
No, I'm just saying me and JC
got some similarities, you know?

10:41.099 --> 10:43.352
We both got kick-ass beards.

10:43.436 --> 10:45.896
Christmas is coming,
I got no place to stay.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.856
And one time, I was using my nail gun

10:47.940 --> 10:50.859
and I accidentally attached
myself to a two-by-four.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.236
Mmm.

10:52.320 --> 10:56.073
That time we had to pump your stomach,
you literally came back from the dead.

10:56.157 --> 10:57.575
See?

10:58.159 --> 10:59.243
Well...

11:01.245 --> 11:02.580
I have a miracle of my own.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.166
I'm going to turn some beer into water.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.589
[sighs] What you doin'
for Christmas, Hank?

11:12.089 --> 11:15.218
I'll worry about that
when December rolls around.

11:16.594 --> 11:18.596
Uh... Hank.

11:22.350 --> 11:23.809
Oh, shit.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.021
What the hell did I do for Thanksgiving?

11:32.276 --> 11:34.152
Ma, I need to talk.

11:34.237 --> 11:35.404
What's up?

11:36.364 --> 11:37.448
Merry Christmas, Hank.

11:37.531 --> 11:38.949
Don't rub it in.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.286
- [sighs]
- What's up, Colt?

11:43.579 --> 11:45.139
Dad told me you're
making him sell the ranch

11:45.163 --> 11:46.643
'cause he won't give half to Rooster.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.585
Wait, what?

11:49.668 --> 11:51.003
I'm doing it for you guys.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.981
At least you'll get some
money from the proceeds.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.758
I don't want free money.
I wanna work there.

11:55.841 --> 11:58.261
Whoa. Where the hell did that come from?

11:58.344 --> 11:59.803
Hang on a sec.

11:59.887 --> 12:03.849
You and Dad are gonna sell the ranch,
because he won't put my name on it?

12:03.932 --> 12:05.268
Who cares?

12:06.018 --> 12:08.479
And you don't wanna work with
me? You're a fucking idiot.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.356
I'm trying to protect you.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.691
No, I get that, Mom, but
I don't need protection.

12:12.775 --> 12:15.361
I got the new job with
a future. I'm all set.

12:15.444 --> 12:18.906
Plus, once Dad's gone, Colt's
just gonna give me my half anyway.

12:20.032 --> 12:22.576
I mean... [stammers] we'll
definitely talk about it.

12:23.619 --> 12:25.954
Look, you sell the ranch,
you're just gonna hurt him,

12:26.038 --> 12:27.205
you might end up killing Dad.

12:27.290 --> 12:29.351
No way. I do not wanna deal
with that on my conscience.

12:29.375 --> 12:33.045
[scoffs] I just don't see why your
father should decide who gets what.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.255
Isn't that exactly what you're doing?

12:35.339 --> 12:36.799
I mean, this is our ranch.

12:36.882 --> 12:39.051
It's your ranch. It's the family ranch.

12:39.134 --> 12:42.638
The <i>Grand Junction Sentinel</i> article
entitled "What Happened to Colt Bennett?"

12:42.721 --> 12:47.310
starts with, "Colt Bennett was forced
to retreat to his family ranch."

12:48.936 --> 12:51.314
You memorized an article
about how bad you are?

12:52.481 --> 12:55.359
I memorized an article
about how good I once was.

12:55.443 --> 12:57.445
The point is, it's our ranch.

12:57.528 --> 12:59.697
Are you really gonna be okay with this?

12:59.780 --> 13:01.949
Of course. It's gotta
stay in the family.

13:02.032 --> 13:05.994
I felt that way all along, but
then your dad just made me so crazy,

13:06.078 --> 13:08.163
I might have lost sight
of the big picture.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.708
Yeah, well, the big picture
is me and Abby and our kids,

13:10.791 --> 13:13.043
sitting on the porch, watching
Rooster work on my ranch.

13:15.045 --> 13:19.508
The point was to make you both happy,
so if this is what you want, then...

13:19.592 --> 13:21.301
No, this is what's best for everyone.

13:22.219 --> 13:25.973
Look at that. Me making
sacrifices for the greater good.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.641
I am like Jesus.

13:38.402 --> 13:41.196
I really gotta start locking this door.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.075
Hi, Beau.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.496
I'm not sure I can do
this right now, Maggie.

13:48.579 --> 13:51.540
No, you can leave the ranch to Colt.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.752
It's all right. I'll just
take the hunting cabin.

13:54.835 --> 13:58.255
I had Jerry draw up a
new draft of the papers.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.257
Evidently, the old one...

14:00.340 --> 14:03.761
had too many curse words
scrawled in the margins.

14:07.222 --> 14:08.516
You're okay with that?

14:09.307 --> 14:11.226
Rooster is, and that's what's important.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.020
He cared enough about this ranch

14:13.103 --> 14:15.856
that he sacrificed his piece
to keep it in the family.

14:16.774 --> 14:17.941
All right.

14:20.986 --> 14:23.989
I guess there's nothing
left to do but to sign it.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.492
Yeah, that's all we gotta do.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.416
I'll go first.

15:03.779 --> 15:05.113
I guess that's it.

15:06.198 --> 15:07.240
Yep.

15:08.158 --> 15:11.078
The government finally
has my name on something.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.671
Feels strange, doesn't it?

15:21.714 --> 15:22.798
Yeah.

15:23.632 --> 15:27.010
It's 40 years of marriage gone
in... a couple of signatures.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.306
What do we do now?

15:32.808 --> 15:34.142
I don't know.

15:35.894 --> 15:38.313
We start our new lives, I guess.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.400
Maybe we should sign up for Tinder.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.658
What the fuck is Tinder?

15:52.578 --> 15:55.664
Well, it's a dating app
that you put on your phone

15:55.748 --> 15:59.793
and then you swipe right on a
photo if you like the person.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.920
I think I'll just die alone.

16:06.049 --> 16:09.344
You know, we're still having the Christmas
party down at the bar tomorrow night.

16:09.427 --> 16:10.554
You should come by.

16:10.638 --> 16:13.306
- I don't think so, Mags.
- Why not?

16:13.390 --> 16:15.476
Just because our marriage is over,

16:15.559 --> 16:18.020
doesn't mean we're not gonna
be in each other's lives.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.773
I just don't think I'd be able to...

16:22.190 --> 16:24.026
spread any good cheer.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.237
So, it'd be like every other year.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.083
So, how do we...

16:40.167 --> 16:41.418
I don't know.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.180
[mouths] Hey...

16:53.263 --> 16:55.683
I'm glad we didn't
get rid of this place.

16:57.142 --> 16:58.769
Me, too, Mags.

17:01.689 --> 17:02.731
Bye, Beau.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.329
All right.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.790
Here you go, Colt. Two mimosas.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.710
- [Hank and Rooster laugh]
- They're for Abby.

17:22.792 --> 17:25.295
It's winter break. They
taste like springtime.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.214
[sighs]

17:28.298 --> 17:29.717
Hey, is, uh, Dad comin'?

17:29.800 --> 17:31.570
'Cause if he is, I'm gonna
need a few more of these.

17:31.594 --> 17:33.596
Oh, you know your father.

17:33.679 --> 17:35.723
He's just a total grinch.

17:35.806 --> 17:36.974
Wait...

17:37.474 --> 17:38.851
he hates Christmas,

17:38.934 --> 17:41.186
lives alone with a
dog, has heart problems.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.669
[whispers] He really is the Grinch!

17:42.730 --> 17:43.772
[chuckles]

17:45.065 --> 17:46.399
Hey, Maggie, merry Christmas.

17:46.483 --> 17:48.569
Merry Christmas, Dale. Glad to have ya.

17:48.652 --> 17:49.695
How you doing, Dale?

17:49.778 --> 17:52.197
Rooster, I hear you're going
to work for Neumann's Hill.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.406
- Yep.
- [chuckles]

17:53.490 --> 17:55.232
I've always said,

17:55.257 --> 17:58.560
"The best rancher within three
counties is Rooster Bennett."

17:58.621 --> 18:01.707
[chuckles] You trying to butter
me up so I hire you as my vet?

18:01.790 --> 18:05.377
Well, I won't overcharge
you like I do your dad.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.629
Hmm.

18:08.714 --> 18:11.717
I thought we were doing presents
at my house later tonight.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.028
We are, but that one... This
is for you and your parents.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.888
Oh, yeah. The brown
paper bag was too fancy?

18:15.971 --> 18:18.074
You had to go with an envelope
the water bill came in?

18:18.098 --> 18:19.933
[chuckles] It's your
other Christmas present.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.184
Saving the Earth.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.311
[chuckles]

18:24.437 --> 18:26.231
Oh, my God!

18:26.314 --> 18:29.860
- Denver Broncos playoff tickets? What?
- [chuckling] Yeah.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.862
I figured we could go with your parents.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.531
It would be your dad,
your mom, you, and then me.

18:34.615 --> 18:37.376
That... that way we can be with
them, but I don't have to talk to 'em.

18:37.409 --> 18:39.129
I'll just be like,
"Hey, great seats, right?

18:39.161 --> 18:41.664
- You want a beer? Defense!"
- [Abby chuckles]

18:41.747 --> 18:43.874
This is so sweet. Thank you.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.545
You see Kenny over there?

18:48.629 --> 18:50.338
- [clears throat]
- Yeah.

18:50.422 --> 18:53.300
Oh, great. Now he saw me looking at him.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.803
[both clear throat]

18:56.762 --> 18:58.931
- Now I'm waving like a jackass.
- [chuckles]

19:00.933 --> 19:03.518
Did he just give me
the "go-to-hell" nod?

19:03.601 --> 19:04.937
Fuck him. I'm gonna keep waving.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.439
- No, stop that! Stop!
- [chuckles]

19:08.190 --> 19:09.650
[clears throat] Hey, Colt.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.278
Check it out.

19:13.361 --> 19:14.697
[Abby laughing]

19:14.780 --> 19:16.406
Merry Christmas, bitch.

19:17.115 --> 19:19.993
And this year, I also made mugs.

19:20.077 --> 19:21.369
- [Abby chuckles]
- Get it?

19:21.453 --> 19:22.830
- Mug shot mug.
- [Colt] Uh-huh.

19:22.913 --> 19:24.915
- You know what would be hilarious?
- Hmm?

19:24.998 --> 19:27.000
Mug shot shot glasses.

19:27.084 --> 19:29.002
Oh, Abby, you're a genius.

19:29.086 --> 19:30.479
- [Abby giggles]
- You get a t-shirt.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.629
Yes!

19:31.714 --> 19:32.982
[chuckling] How many
of them do you have?

19:33.006 --> 19:35.383
- Hey, Colt.
- Ah!

19:39.054 --> 19:40.263
Holy shit.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.183
Is that Tanya Showers?

19:47.980 --> 19:49.231
[Colt] She knows Kenny?

19:50.232 --> 19:52.067
[all] What the fuck?

19:53.819 --> 19:55.237
Uh, Abby, no offense,

19:55.320 --> 19:57.948
but I'm, like, super jealous
of your ex-boyfriend right now.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.616
So am I.

20:01.409 --> 20:02.828
So am I.

20:05.622 --> 20:08.625
All right. I'm gonna go
over there and talk to them.

20:08.709 --> 20:10.585
Kenny better have fucking
cancer or something.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.548
Hey, Kenny dog, what's up, man?

20:15.632 --> 20:17.509
- Hey.
- How you doing? Who's your friend?

20:17.592 --> 20:19.636
- Uh, Tanya, this is Rooster.
- Hi.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.072
- Hi. [Chuckles]
- Rooster, this is...

20:21.096 --> 20:23.324
Yeah, I know who you are. You're
my favorite weather girl ever.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.243
We met once at a Chili's,
it didn't go very well.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.587
Why'd I bring that up? [Chuckles]

20:27.269 --> 20:29.687
So, uh, how'd you guys meet?

20:29.772 --> 20:32.274
Tanya came to the hotel to
do an investigative report

20:32.357 --> 20:34.359
on some fungi in our ice machines.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.987
I said I was a "fun
guy," and we were off.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.405
- [laughing]
- [Kenny] Yeah.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.782
Fuck a duck, huh?

20:43.326 --> 20:45.662
[sighs] So, uh, Tanya...

20:46.579 --> 20:49.082
[sighs] how about the weather
we're having right now, huh?

20:49.875 --> 20:51.501
I really don't wanna talk about work.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.021
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [Kenny] Come on, babe.

20:53.045 --> 20:55.422
Let's head to a low
pressure zone. [Laughs]

20:55.505 --> 20:57.549
[laughing] You are so funny.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.219
What is happening right now?

21:03.596 --> 21:05.348
- Hey, babe.
- [chuckles] 'Sup, girl?

21:05.432 --> 21:07.184
Mmm, hey. What is that?

21:07.267 --> 21:08.351
Lincoln County?

21:08.435 --> 21:10.235
- That's where I got my mug shot.
- [laughing]

21:11.939 --> 21:13.857
Oh, what were you two doing back there?

21:13.941 --> 21:16.101
- Uh, we were having sex.
- I had to make a phone call.

21:16.902 --> 21:20.113
Oh, I did not realize we were
lying. [Chuckles nervously]

21:21.031 --> 21:24.034
Uh, but to be fair to her, uh, she
was on the phone for part of it.

21:26.036 --> 21:28.288
This is awkward. I'm
gonna go grab a drink.

21:28.371 --> 21:30.373
I'll get you one, too, Roberto.

21:30.457 --> 21:34.098
Thank you. It's, uh,
Umberto. With an "Um",

21:34.123 --> 21:37.571
As in, "Um, you just forgot the
name of the person you had sex with."

21:38.173 --> 21:40.217
All right, Umberto, we need to talk.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.676
Yeah, so, you know,

21:41.759 --> 21:43.720
what are your intentions
with our daughter?

21:44.429 --> 21:48.100
Look, Darlene is my oldest daughter and
the mother of my two grandkids, okay?

21:48.183 --> 21:49.517
I cannot see her get hurt again.

21:49.601 --> 21:50.811
Oh, no, no, I...

21:50.894 --> 21:54.231
I find her charming,
funny, beautiful and...

21:54.314 --> 21:56.441
if things go well, well, maybe...

21:56.524 --> 21:58.735
Well, maybe I'm the reason
she moves out of your house.

21:59.736 --> 22:00.863
You have my blessing.

22:00.946 --> 22:02.197
[chuckles]

22:11.664 --> 22:13.083
[knocking on door]

22:14.877 --> 22:16.003
[laughs]

22:16.086 --> 22:18.046
Wow, that's great service.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.507
How'd you know I was here?

22:20.590 --> 22:21.758
Are you kidding?

22:21.842 --> 22:25.595
I can hear that piece of crap Chevy
of yours coming from two counties away.

22:26.972 --> 22:29.307
That's funny. I never hear your Ford.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.559
I guess that's 'cause it never runs.

22:31.643 --> 22:33.020
[chuckles] That's funny.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.605
Come on in, Joanne.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.400
Oh, look at you!

22:38.483 --> 22:39.859
Getting in the holiday spirit.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.737
Eh, Colt did that. I hate it.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.281
Well, you're gonna hate this.

22:44.364 --> 22:46.616
I got you a little something.

22:46.699 --> 22:47.742
Oh.

22:49.036 --> 22:50.787
- [chuckles]
- [laughs]

22:52.164 --> 22:53.665
- That's cute.
- [laughs]

22:54.832 --> 22:56.876
I got you a little something.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.673
Oh, that's beautiful. Did
you wrap this yourself?

23:01.756 --> 23:03.091
I did.

23:04.259 --> 23:05.802
[laughs]

23:07.095 --> 23:08.846
How's it look?

23:08.931 --> 23:11.766
Well, everything above the
bill of the hat looks just fine.

23:11.849 --> 23:13.143
[Joanne chuckles]

23:14.102 --> 23:15.228
Yeah.

23:16.354 --> 23:18.315
So how... how's everything?

23:18.398 --> 23:19.942
Did you settle things with Maggie?

23:20.692 --> 23:22.194
Yep.

23:22.277 --> 23:23.528
It's all over now.

23:23.611 --> 23:26.239
Beau, I'm only gonna ask you
this once. Did you kill her?

23:27.865 --> 23:31.786
Because when the snow melts,
they're gonna find her body.

23:31.869 --> 23:34.081
We signed the divorce papers.

23:34.998 --> 23:36.874
Well, I... I'm sorry.

23:38.085 --> 23:40.712
But sometimes change
can be a good thing.

23:40.795 --> 23:43.215
Yeah. I'm not a big fan of change.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.633
You gonna stay for dinner?

23:45.717 --> 23:47.760
- I'm gonna burn this hat on the grill.
- [chuckles]

23:47.844 --> 23:50.055
Might as well toss a
couple of steaks on, too.

23:50.138 --> 23:51.806
Well, I... I appreciate it,

23:51.889 --> 23:54.601
but I am on my way to see my daughter.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.728
I thought she wasn't
speaking to you anymore.

23:56.811 --> 23:59.731
She wasn't. But that
didn't keep me from trying.

23:59.814 --> 24:01.066
So I reached out to her,

24:01.149 --> 24:05.028
I reached out to her, and this
time she didn't slap my hand away.

24:05.112 --> 24:06.571
What changed her mind?

24:06.654 --> 24:09.282
Well, I like to think
that the holiday season

24:09.366 --> 24:11.701
finally got her in the
spirit of forgiveness.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.910
Or she needs bail money.

24:12.995 --> 24:14.662
[both chuckle]

24:14.746 --> 24:15.830
Doesn't matter.

24:15.913 --> 24:18.333
Anyway, I'm finally gonna
meet my granddaughter.

24:18.416 --> 24:20.127
- That's great.
- [chuckles]

24:20.210 --> 24:21.419
I'm happy for you.

24:22.670 --> 24:25.548
Say, you wanna borrow my truck
so you can make a good impression?

24:25.632 --> 24:28.135
[chuckles] No, I
actually wanna get there.

24:30.678 --> 24:34.141
Speaking of that, I... I should get
on the road before it starts snowing.

24:35.142 --> 24:36.268
Okay.

24:41.231 --> 24:44.442
Tell me you're not just
spending Christmas Eve all alone.

24:44.526 --> 24:47.237
Well, everybody's down
at the bar having a party.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.680
Well, you should go on down there.

24:48.738 --> 24:50.948
I don't think Rooster wants to see me.

24:51.033 --> 24:53.785
Oh, Beau, if you never went
where people didn't want you,

24:53.868 --> 24:55.245
you'd never talk to anybody.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.167
[chuckles]

25:03.628 --> 25:05.380
I'll talk to you soon, Beau.

25:07.299 --> 25:08.800
Take care on the road.

25:10.718 --> 25:11.719
Hey, you forgot your hat.

25:11.803 --> 25:13.930
Oh, no, I didn't. Merry Christmas.

25:19.936 --> 25:21.313
Well...

25:21.396 --> 25:22.730
Merry Christmas, everybody.

25:22.814 --> 25:23.940
[both] Merry Christmas.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.276
- I should get going.
- Hey. Careful getting home.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.360
Thank you.

25:27.444 --> 25:28.695
I'm not going home.

25:28.778 --> 25:31.156
I'm gonna go meet Darlene
at her house for round two.

25:32.449 --> 25:34.701
You know... of sex.

25:36.328 --> 25:37.662
[chuckles] Yeah, we got it.

25:37.745 --> 25:39.831
Hey, pro tip. Don't wake up them babies.

25:39.914 --> 25:41.958
- Oh.
- Oh, no, she has the perfect idea.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.710
We're gonna wear sleigh bells

25:43.793 --> 25:46.003
so the kids think it's
Santa on the roof top.

25:51.634 --> 25:52.719
All right...

25:52.802 --> 25:54.221
- these are for you.
- Aw!

25:54.304 --> 25:55.847
- All right!
- [grunts]

25:55.930 --> 25:57.599
[Rooster chuckles]

25:59.267 --> 26:01.978
Wait, $3,724?

26:02.061 --> 26:04.897
$8,442? What is this?

26:04.981 --> 26:07.442
Your bar tabs for the year.

26:07.525 --> 26:09.736
- Whoa! [Chuckles]
- Damn!

26:09.819 --> 26:12.614
Yeah. All right, merry Christmas!

26:12.697 --> 26:13.948
[Rooster and Colt] Whoa!

26:14.031 --> 26:17.619
- Best Christmas gift ever!
- That's right.

26:17.702 --> 26:20.288
Yeah. Plus, mine was, like, five
grand more than yours, so there.

26:20.372 --> 26:22.225
Yeah, but you were here for
eight months more than me,

26:22.249 --> 26:24.376
- so technically, I outdrank you.
- No, guys,

26:24.459 --> 26:27.629
this was meant as an intervention,
not a competition, all right?

26:27.712 --> 26:29.714
- Merry Christmas.
- [stammers] Wait, Mom.

26:29.797 --> 26:30.858
- We got something for you.
- Oh, yeah.

26:30.882 --> 26:32.259
- Get... get it.
- Okay, hang on.

26:32.342 --> 26:33.801
Come on, get it.

26:33.885 --> 26:35.845
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh!

26:35.928 --> 26:37.555
- [chuckles]
- What...

26:39.349 --> 26:41.017
Wow, tap handles.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.145
- [Rooster] Ha-ha!
- [laughs]

26:43.228 --> 26:44.896
Come on! One's a colt, one's a rooster.

26:44.979 --> 26:46.189
- I know.
- Get it?

26:46.273 --> 26:47.940
Hey, put 'em on. Try... try it out.

26:48.024 --> 26:49.025
Yeah, get us a beer!

26:49.108 --> 26:51.611
Yeah. Hey, hey, put it on
my tab. Put it on my tab.

26:51.694 --> 26:54.455
[chuckles] We got you something
else. All right, get... get her the...

26:55.782 --> 26:56.949
- There we go.
- And...

26:57.033 --> 26:58.117
[Colt imitating drumroll]

26:58.201 --> 27:02.997
Oh, look. It's the three of us
out front the day I got the place.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.183
- Thank you.
- [Rooster] Yeah.

27:04.207 --> 27:07.585
Now, even though you and Dad got divorced,
we're still gonna see you all the time.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.337
- That's right.
- Of course you are.

27:09.421 --> 27:11.381
I run the only bar in town.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.175
[chuckles]

27:14.676 --> 27:15.802
Hey.

27:16.928 --> 27:17.929
Beau. Wow.

27:19.222 --> 27:20.307
Oh, shit.

27:22.559 --> 27:24.477
I feel like I missed the party.

27:24.561 --> 27:27.189
Yeah. You also missed Tanya Showers.

27:27.272 --> 27:28.273
What?

27:29.191 --> 27:31.568
Why didn't you send me a fucking text?

27:33.778 --> 27:35.947
We didn't think you were coming by.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.784
What's the worst thing that
could happen? We'd get a divorce?

27:41.869 --> 27:43.246
What? Holy shit.

27:43.330 --> 27:45.707
We're already joking
about this? That's great!

27:48.751 --> 27:50.337
Here.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.675
All right, usually people say,
"Merry Christmas," but, cool.

27:55.758 --> 27:57.278
Hold on, hold on. If
we're doing gifts...

27:57.302 --> 28:00.763
Dad, I got yours in the truck.
Rooster, I got yours... right here.

28:00.847 --> 28:01.967
Where the hell did I put it?

28:02.014 --> 28:03.600
- Oh, there it is.
- [Beau laughs]

28:03.683 --> 28:04.934
[laughs]

28:05.017 --> 28:06.102
Oh, check it out.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.372
Hang on, I grabbed a receipt for
that in case I wanna return it.

28:08.396 --> 28:09.772
[all laugh]

28:18.656 --> 28:19.949
Is this Grandpa's knife?

28:20.032 --> 28:21.158
Yeah.

28:22.285 --> 28:23.661
I want you to have it.

28:25.538 --> 28:29.792
You're gonna have your ups and
downs on that My Little Pony Ranch...

28:33.045 --> 28:35.340
but you can always look at that and...

28:35.423 --> 28:39.802
know you come from a long
line of great ranchers.

28:43.014 --> 28:44.432
And you're one of 'em.

28:46.809 --> 28:47.852
Okay.

28:49.354 --> 28:50.938
Now, give me a penny.

28:52.815 --> 28:53.858
What?

28:54.484 --> 28:57.737
It's bad luck to give
a knife away for free.

28:59.030 --> 29:02.409
When my dad got that from his
father, he had to give him a penny.

29:03.326 --> 29:06.704
I had to give one to my dad.
Now, give me a damn penny.

29:08.665 --> 29:09.957
I've got...

29:10.917 --> 29:12.084
I mean, I've got a twenty.

29:12.168 --> 29:13.420
That'll work.

29:16.423 --> 29:17.674
[exhales heavily] Great, Dad.

29:17.757 --> 29:20.343
Thanks for... selling
me my Christmas gift.

29:21.428 --> 29:23.805
[panting] All right. There it is. Here.

29:23.888 --> 29:25.265
[chuckling]

29:28.601 --> 29:29.811
[sighs]

29:33.940 --> 29:36.693
What in the hell am
I gonna do with these?

29:38.653 --> 29:40.405
Sweetheart, what were you thinking?

29:40.488 --> 29:41.864
Worst gift ever.

29:47.036 --> 29:48.913
All right, I'm gonna go to Abby's.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.933
- All right, all right. Careful.
- I'll see you, Mom. Later.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.225
- Yeah, yeah.
- Colt, wait a minute.

29:52.249 --> 29:53.460
I got something for you.

29:54.544 --> 29:55.587
Really?

29:56.921 --> 29:58.923
Merry Christmas.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.049
Whoa.

30:01.843 --> 30:03.303
Did not see that coming.

30:05.221 --> 30:06.723
Do not cry, Bennett.

30:07.765 --> 30:09.225
Lock it up. [Clears throat]

30:11.102 --> 30:12.228
[Colt huffs]

30:12.312 --> 30:14.522
I ain't been that emotional since...

30:14.606 --> 30:17.442
Ebenezer Scrooge gave a turkey
to Kermit the Frog. [Chuckles]

30:18.109 --> 30:19.319
All right.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.155
I'm gonna lock up out back.

30:23.239 --> 30:28.035
You guys okay, or you need a second
knife to make it a fair fight?

30:28.995 --> 30:30.246
We're all right.

30:37.420 --> 30:38.755
You got a place to stay?

30:39.339 --> 30:40.382
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:40.465 --> 30:41.591
Good.

30:43.134 --> 30:44.552
You know, if you wanna...

30:45.553 --> 30:47.096
move back into the house...

30:47.179 --> 30:48.848
No.

30:48.931 --> 30:50.266
No, thanks.

30:51.851 --> 30:53.060
All right.

30:58.274 --> 31:00.610
You know, Dad, I, uh...

31:00.693 --> 31:03.405
appreciate the gesture of the knife...

31:05.532 --> 31:08.284
but if you really thought
I was a great rancher...

31:09.911 --> 31:11.704
I'd still be at home working with you.

31:18.335 --> 31:19.546
[grunts softly]

31:19.629 --> 31:20.880
Merry Christmas.

32:06.884 --> 32:08.553
Heather.

32:08.636 --> 32:09.679
Hey, Colt.

32:09.762 --> 32:10.805
Hey.

32:11.723 --> 32:12.807
What are you doing here?

32:13.600 --> 32:16.060
I mean... Merry Christmas.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.895
[chuckles] You, too.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.484
What's up?

32:23.443 --> 32:24.944
Nothing. Um...

32:26.278 --> 32:27.572
I just...

32:33.495 --> 32:34.746
I'm pregnant.

32:40.042 --> 32:41.043
Whoa.

32:41.794 --> 32:43.087
Yeah.

32:51.929 --> 32:53.931
