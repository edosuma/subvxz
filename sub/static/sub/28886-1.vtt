02:46.609 --> 02:48.381
So you know me.

02:48.383 --> 02:51.346
I end up hitting it right
there in the parking lot.

02:51.348 --> 02:52.179
What?

02:52.181 --> 02:53.350
Hell nah.

02:53.352 --> 02:55.449
I mean what can I say?

02:55.451 --> 02:58.348
I mean we obviously
couldn't go anywhere else.

02:58.350 --> 03:00.705
That's cold, boy.

03:00.707 --> 03:02.128
I believe it though.

03:02.130 --> 03:03.556
My man always comes through.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.056
Straight guerrilla pimp.

03:05.058 --> 03:06.741
Yeah, you know.

03:06.743 --> 03:09.280
You know being a pretty good
night all things considered.

03:09.282 --> 03:10.624
Pretty good?

03:10.626 --> 03:12.113
Homie, I seen the girl.

03:12.115 --> 03:13.408
She was fine.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.798
That's a perfect end to a perfect night.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.397
But she ain't cook you breakfast?

03:17.399 --> 03:19.099
You ain't get your three squares?

03:19.101 --> 03:20.018
Nah, man.

03:21.403 --> 03:22.236
Worse.

03:23.276 --> 03:24.112
Wait what?

03:24.114 --> 03:27.004
It's what happened after that.

03:27.006 --> 03:28.006
Wait what?

03:29.206 --> 03:30.956
Do I even wanna know?

03:31.913 --> 03:32.746
What man?

03:34.722 --> 03:37.072
I got some unfortunate information.

03:37.074 --> 03:38.157
Dog, this is Hesperia.

03:38.159 --> 03:39.617
What else is knew?

03:39.619 --> 03:42.772
On the way home after the
game, I ran into Big Jake,

03:42.774 --> 03:46.240
or should I say Big Jake ran into me.

03:46.242 --> 03:47.242
This fool.

03:48.490 --> 03:50.067
Dang dog.

03:50.069 --> 03:52.294
I thought you were gonna
say you scratched her ride

03:52.296 --> 03:54.494
or lost your keys.

03:54.496 --> 03:56.329
Man, forget that fool.

03:58.128 --> 03:59.757
What'd he say?

03:59.759 --> 04:02.025
Let's just say he had
some strong words for me.

04:02.027 --> 04:02.858
I mean I get it.

04:02.860 --> 04:04.321
I did break his wrists.

04:04.323 --> 04:06.050
You did break his wrists.

04:06.052 --> 04:07.666
But as charming as I am,

04:07.668 --> 04:12.406
I was able to talk him off
that ledge and that was that.

04:12.408 --> 04:14.566
Yo, let's pop that fool.

04:14.568 --> 04:15.742
It ain't that simple.

04:15.744 --> 04:17.377
Homie, it's that simple.

04:17.379 --> 04:19.366
I got the heat in the ride right now.

04:19.368 --> 04:20.199
Look.

04:20.201 --> 04:21.031
I'll go tonight.

04:21.034 --> 04:21.865
Bro.

04:21.867 --> 04:22.698
Bro.

04:22.700 --> 04:23.590
Bro, man what?

04:23.592 --> 04:24.549
No one trusts him.

04:24.551 --> 04:26.602
No one likes him.

04:26.604 --> 04:28.497
Granted those are traits
of a true gangster,

04:28.499 --> 04:31.223
but I mean we ain't
gotta keep doing business

04:31.225 --> 04:32.698
with a man like that.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.678
We don't need him.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.587
Look, it's been a peaceful time here

04:36.589 --> 04:38.578
and we gotta respect that.

04:38.580 --> 04:39.657
There hasn't been any conflict

04:39.659 --> 04:41.074
between the neighborhoods in years

04:41.076 --> 04:43.210
and I intend to keep it that way.

04:43.212 --> 04:44.554
Plus the main goal is profit.

04:44.556 --> 04:46.743
Everything else is a setback.

04:46.745 --> 04:50.506
Besides, whether you want to
admit it or not, we need him.

04:50.508 --> 04:51.850
Nah, we don't need him.

04:51.852 --> 04:53.291
We just supposed to let him slide?

04:53.293 --> 04:54.973
Look I'm saying though.

04:54.975 --> 04:57.275
Ain't nothing cool about being locked up.

04:57.277 --> 04:58.899
I know you don't know what that's like,

04:58.901 --> 05:00.778
but I'm not going back.

05:00.780 --> 05:04.162
And that's what's gonna
happen if I stay here.

05:04.164 --> 05:06.262
If you stay here?

05:06.264 --> 05:08.157
What do you mean if you stay here?

05:08.159 --> 05:09.070
You finally tucking tail?

05:09.072 --> 05:10.522
Turning your back on your boys, huh?

05:10.524 --> 05:11.881
Nah, it's not like that, bruh.

05:11.883 --> 05:12.959
Better start explaining, cuz.

05:12.961 --> 05:14.029
You sound shook.

05:14.031 --> 05:16.366
Look man, after all these years.

05:16.368 --> 05:18.034
All the bloody messes.

05:18.036 --> 05:19.666
All the dope.

05:19.668 --> 05:21.345
Chris getting shot in the face.

05:21.347 --> 05:23.530
Moms dying right in front of my eyes.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.065
I'm done, homie.

05:25.067 --> 05:27.190
How many skulls are left
to crack in Hesperia?

05:27.192 --> 05:28.545
Homie, you can't tell me this ain't

05:28.547 --> 05:30.646
the easiest money you made
off these crystal heads, man.

05:30.648 --> 05:34.269
Look, slinging meth to
fiends ain't my idea of easy.

05:34.271 --> 05:36.155
I'm tired of looking over my shoulder.

05:36.157 --> 05:37.764
I'm tired of white women
clutching they purse

05:37.766 --> 05:39.658
every time I walk by.

05:39.660 --> 05:41.662
I'm tired of making
money off of sick people.

05:41.664 --> 05:44.626
Homie, you providing these
people with a service, man.

05:44.628 --> 05:47.139
Man, there's better ways.

05:47.141 --> 05:48.672
Like what?

05:48.674 --> 05:49.574
I don't know if you notice.

05:49.576 --> 05:52.066
We ain't exactly the suit and tie type.

05:52.068 --> 05:53.126
What you gonna do?

05:53.128 --> 05:54.514
Roll up to Wells Fargo like can I help you

05:54.516 --> 05:56.127
with your personal banking, miss?

05:56.129 --> 05:58.476
Look at this point, anything's
better getting ran up on

05:58.478 --> 05:59.914
by some meth head.

05:59.916 --> 06:01.905
Homie, that's why we stay strapped.

06:01.907 --> 06:02.953
Never leave home without it.

06:02.955 --> 06:04.994
See that's exactly my point.

06:04.996 --> 06:06.882
Sooner or later one of
us is gonna get caught.

06:06.884 --> 06:09.538
I hate to be the one to
say it but it's true.

06:09.540 --> 06:12.442
Look, it's been too quiet for too long.

06:12.444 --> 06:14.987
People are looking for us
to keep the peace, man.

06:14.989 --> 06:16.342
That's why you're gonna
have to run a tight ship

06:16.344 --> 06:17.974
and watch your back.

06:17.976 --> 06:19.863
Watch my back?

06:19.865 --> 06:20.938
Yo what is all this?

06:20.940 --> 06:21.771
Watch my back.

06:21.773 --> 06:22.773
If you stay.

06:23.622 --> 06:26.391
Homie, you acting real shook, man.

06:26.393 --> 06:29.482
Ever since Big Jake rolled up on you.

06:29.484 --> 06:30.651
Watch my back.

06:31.572 --> 06:33.382
If you stay.

06:33.384 --> 06:35.350
What's going on with you, man?

06:35.352 --> 06:36.982
Yo, we don't need him.

06:36.984 --> 06:39.334
We can run this ship
like we been running it.

06:39.336 --> 06:40.624
No one else.

06:40.626 --> 06:42.274
You and me.

06:42.276 --> 06:43.500
Think about it, dog.

06:43.502 --> 06:46.618
Look, I am thinking about it every day.

06:46.620 --> 06:48.753
I got a family that needs me, man.

06:48.755 --> 06:51.911
I got a mom that can't use
the bathroom by herself.

06:51.913 --> 06:53.770
I got people looking to me to feed them.

06:53.772 --> 06:56.746
I got a brother that's one of
the smartest kids in his class

06:56.748 --> 06:58.318
that's gonna end up just like me

06:58.320 --> 06:59.655
if he don't get out of this town

06:59.657 --> 07:02.062
and get a real shot at life.

07:02.064 --> 07:03.826
I need something else.

07:03.828 --> 07:05.460
I gotta make it right for them,

07:05.462 --> 07:09.045
even if that means giving up the game.

07:09.047 --> 07:11.380
So what you gonna do, man?

07:12.972 --> 07:14.481
'Bout to make that move to L.A.

07:14.483 --> 07:16.245
Hollywood?

07:16.247 --> 07:17.664
Yeah Hollywood.

07:19.632 --> 07:21.499
Look, I have an aunt and uncle

07:21.501 --> 07:26.501
that's gonna put me up in
Venice until I can find a job.

07:26.510 --> 07:28.343
Don't that sound good?

07:29.493 --> 07:30.358
It sounds aight.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.761
Okay well check it out.

07:31.763 --> 07:34.339
On top of that, since all
my dope money is going

07:34.341 --> 07:36.814
to my mom's treatment,
my boy's gonna hook me up

07:36.816 --> 07:38.420
with a real job.

07:38.422 --> 07:40.375
Maybe like a mechanic.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.492
Then move up doing kits.

07:42.494 --> 07:43.675
Something I actually like.

07:43.677 --> 07:45.631
Something I'm actually good at it.

07:45.633 --> 07:49.550
Not running around slinging
base to meth heads.

07:50.519 --> 07:53.059
Going to Hollywood, huh?

07:53.061 --> 07:55.699
Slinging and banging your way to the top.

07:55.701 --> 07:56.982
Mister Hollywood.

07:56.984 --> 07:58.362
Yeah you know me.

07:58.364 --> 07:59.781
Mister Hollywood.

08:01.185 --> 08:04.102
Yeah, just don't get
caught up in the silicons.

08:04.104 --> 08:05.287
You know what I'm saying?

08:05.289 --> 08:07.039
And all the fakeness.

08:08.831 --> 08:09.662
Man.

08:09.664 --> 08:10.519
Look man.

08:10.521 --> 08:12.655
You been down since day one.

08:12.657 --> 08:16.675
And you know all the boys got
mad respect for you for real.

08:16.677 --> 08:17.594
No doubt.

08:18.611 --> 08:22.316
But it's about to be some changes.

08:22.318 --> 08:25.063
You gonna have to move up.

08:25.065 --> 08:26.203
It's time for you to take over.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.488
I mean you know all this, man.

08:27.490 --> 08:29.047
You know it better than I do.

08:29.049 --> 08:30.727
You been watching me forever, man.

08:30.729 --> 08:31.893
Plus Jared's getting older,

08:31.895 --> 08:35.241
so you know he can pick up the slack.

08:35.244 --> 08:36.493
So you know you got this.

08:36.495 --> 08:39.955
And plus you the only person I can trust.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.708
Listen man.

08:47.662 --> 08:50.047
You know I got your back from day one.

08:50.049 --> 08:51.947
Wherever you go, wherever you at.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.379
Always have, always will.

08:54.381 --> 08:57.739
Plus I always wanted a promotion.

08:57.741 --> 09:00.491
Well, we on the same page then.

11:26.332 --> 11:27.698
What is it?

11:27.700 --> 11:28.617
Back off.

11:34.244 --> 11:35.161
It's trash.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.200
Close it next time.

12:11.294 --> 12:12.294
Yo ladies.

12:14.488 --> 12:16.532
Yo ladies, where y'all headed?

12:16.534 --> 12:17.842
Drop your phone, ladies.

12:17.844 --> 12:20.540
Yeah, get off the phone, ladies.

12:20.542 --> 12:21.913
Let's go.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.410
You guys know you're
not supposed to walk

12:23.412 --> 12:25.298
and text at the same time.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.662
How y'all can text and
hold each other's hands?

12:30.188 --> 12:31.521
Aw shit.

12:33.365 --> 12:34.515
Where y'all headed to?

12:34.517 --> 12:36.322
Staying over at Theo's
house for the night.

12:36.324 --> 12:37.155
Oh shit.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.290
I knew these cupcakes were fruity birds.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.123
Look at you.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.232
Shut up.

12:41.234 --> 12:44.400
Look, just make sure
you stay out of trouble.

12:44.402 --> 12:45.936
Look into getting into watching videos

12:45.938 --> 12:47.169
and playing with each other's hair.

12:47.171 --> 12:48.511
Yeah, playing with each other's hair.

12:48.513 --> 12:50.376
Look, let him alone.

12:50.378 --> 12:51.928
Fool's mad 'cause he ain't got no hair.

12:51.930 --> 12:53.344
Ha.

12:53.346 --> 12:54.177
Get off me.

12:54.179 --> 12:55.770
Yo, yo, yo, yo, let's just bounce.

12:55.772 --> 12:57.506
Fuck this shit, homie.

12:57.508 --> 12:58.339
Fuck you white boy.

12:58.341 --> 13:01.841
Make sure you let mom know where you at.

13:08.764 --> 13:11.290
They're just stupid.

13:11.292 --> 13:13.952
Why does your brother
hang out with those losers?

13:13.954 --> 13:17.325
Would you rather he hang out with us?

13:17.327 --> 13:18.860
No.

13:18.862 --> 13:20.362
I thought so, man.

13:22.037 --> 13:22.870
Come on.

14:04.617 --> 14:05.450
Hey.

14:06.872 --> 14:08.378
Hey.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.213
What's up?

14:15.958 --> 14:17.125
Hey, 20 bucks.

15:19.015 --> 15:20.182
Oh be quiet.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.941
Make sure to turn the hose off.

17:28.233 --> 17:30.608
So what's mom making for tonight?

17:30.610 --> 17:31.441
I don't know.

17:31.443 --> 17:32.509
Probably the same old thing.

17:32.511 --> 17:33.343
Cool, cool, cool.

17:33.345 --> 17:34.848
Yeah, but you get the dog food.

17:34.850 --> 17:36.373
What?

17:36.375 --> 17:37.405
Shut up.

17:37.407 --> 17:40.262
Hey, have you seen this video?

17:40.264 --> 17:41.508
Dude, that's tight.

17:41.510 --> 17:44.005
I love when that laser comes
out of his chest like that.

17:44.007 --> 17:46.189
Yeah man, it's got like a
couple hundred thousand views.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.298
What?

17:47.300 --> 17:48.409
Yeah, my friend made it, too.

17:48.411 --> 17:50.344
Dude, that's sick.

18:09.012 --> 18:12.788
You boys remember to
take your shoes off.

18:12.790 --> 18:15.115
Go wash your hands.

18:15.117 --> 18:19.784
Your father will be here any
minute and dinner is ready.

18:36.635 --> 18:39.478
Smells really good, Missus C.

18:58.143 --> 18:59.786
I don't know how you boys can watch

18:59.788 --> 19:02.455
the same video a thousand times.

19:04.590 --> 19:05.796
How was school today?

19:05.798 --> 19:06.972
Same.

19:06.974 --> 19:07.807
Same.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.148
Go wash your hands.

19:13.518 --> 19:14.351
Ow.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.368
Are you gonna wear your hat at dinner?

19:52.370 --> 19:53.203
Yeah.

19:54.123 --> 19:55.789
I hate lasagna.

19:55.791 --> 19:57.846
Then don't eat it.

20:09.915 --> 20:10.748
Matt.

20:14.313 --> 20:17.839
Theo, did you do your chores today?

20:17.841 --> 20:19.315
Yeah.

20:19.317 --> 20:20.970
Matt, does your mom know you're here?

20:20.972 --> 20:21.805
Uh huh.

20:24.035 --> 20:28.410
Theo, I'm gonna need
your help this weekend.

20:28.412 --> 20:31.829
Got a bunch of stuff to take to the dump.

20:35.390 --> 20:37.631
Theo, did you hear what I just said?

20:37.633 --> 20:39.633
Yeah, I did my chores.

20:41.305 --> 20:42.419
What's with the videos?

20:42.421 --> 20:43.671
I don't get it.

20:47.993 --> 20:50.076
Theo, put the phone down.

20:55.841 --> 20:57.008
Matt, you too.

21:03.617 --> 21:05.186
Now did you hear what I said about going

21:05.188 --> 21:06.795
to the junkyard this weekend?

21:06.797 --> 21:08.214
Yeah okay, dad.

21:09.449 --> 21:11.199
Turn the phone off.

21:13.433 --> 21:14.583
Can we get through one dinner

21:14.585 --> 21:17.546
without you two using your phones?

21:28.001 --> 21:30.529
Matt, how's your mom?

21:30.531 --> 21:31.364
Good.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.571
And your brother?

21:38.151 --> 21:38.984
Fine.

21:46.927 --> 21:48.569
You two really don't know what

21:48.571 --> 21:51.773
to talk about without your phones, do you?

21:51.775 --> 21:52.738
What do you mean?

21:52.740 --> 21:54.462
I mean, talking to one another.

21:54.464 --> 21:55.295
Interacting.

21:55.297 --> 21:56.742
Doing things that other kids would do.

21:56.744 --> 21:58.722
Kids talk and text on their phones.

21:58.724 --> 22:01.243
No, kids go outside like
I did when I was a kid.

22:01.245 --> 22:02.308
But they didn't have cell phones

22:02.310 --> 22:04.477
when you were a kid right?

22:05.528 --> 22:06.695
That's a joke.

22:08.575 --> 22:10.180
What other things interests you kids

22:10.182 --> 22:13.998
besides texting and just
watching videos all day long?

22:14.000 --> 22:18.583
I mean, if we had an Xbox,
we'd have other interests.

22:20.387 --> 22:21.502
What's an Xbox?

22:21.504 --> 22:23.013
A video game.

22:23.015 --> 22:24.432
It's a console.

22:25.967 --> 22:26.967
Just saying.

22:31.919 --> 22:34.150
What would you do for an Xbox?

22:34.152 --> 22:35.985
- Anything.
- Anything.

22:37.210 --> 22:39.369
Tell you what.

22:39.371 --> 22:43.814
If you can go an entire night
without using your cell phones

22:43.816 --> 22:47.398
I'll consider getting you an Xbox.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.532
What do you mean
without our cell phones?

22:49.534 --> 22:53.853
I mean not using your
phones for an entire night

22:53.855 --> 22:56.605
until the morning for any reason.

22:57.820 --> 23:00.093
How do we do that?

23:00.095 --> 23:01.595
We agreed?

23:02.710 --> 23:03.543
Agreed.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.483
Uh, uh, uh, uh, no, no, no.

23:10.485 --> 23:11.556
Hand them over.

23:11.558 --> 23:12.389
What?

23:12.391 --> 23:13.441
Hand them over.

23:13.443 --> 23:14.276
Theo.

23:15.864 --> 23:16.998
Hand it over.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.474
Dude.

23:18.476 --> 23:19.974
You too, Matt.

23:19.976 --> 23:20.809
Xbox.

23:27.606 --> 23:32.606
I'm gonna lock your cell phones
in this drawer 'til morning.

23:37.532 --> 23:38.532
Don't worry.

23:40.007 --> 23:41.340
They'll be safe.

23:42.919 --> 23:45.669
What are we supposed to do now?

23:47.023 --> 23:49.459
You could help with the dishes.

23:49.461 --> 23:50.294
Really?

23:51.728 --> 23:53.201
That's the point.

23:53.203 --> 23:54.370
Figure it out.

24:00.854 --> 24:02.391
Can we be excused?

24:02.393 --> 24:03.226
Yes.

24:11.650 --> 24:14.150
Wonderful lasagna, Missus C.

24:15.549 --> 24:16.632
Super nice.

24:22.915 --> 24:23.762
What the hell took so long?

24:23.764 --> 24:24.595
It's been hours.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.738
I didn't think you were coming back.

24:26.740 --> 24:28.573
Did you get the stuff?

24:29.901 --> 24:31.539
You gonna answer me or what?

24:31.541 --> 24:32.906
What?

24:32.908 --> 24:34.143
What's wrong with you?

24:34.145 --> 24:34.976
Nothing, man.

24:34.978 --> 24:35.846
It's just look, it's been a long day.

24:35.848 --> 24:37.395
I just wanna get high.

24:37.397 --> 24:38.725
Yeah well it's hot as well.

24:38.727 --> 24:39.961
We have no beer.

24:39.963 --> 24:41.629
I feel like I'm gonna die.

24:41.631 --> 24:44.126
Look man, it just took a
little more this time okay.

24:44.128 --> 24:47.533
What is that even supposed to mean?

24:47.535 --> 24:49.034
It means that it costs more this time

24:49.036 --> 24:50.713
than it did the last time, idiot.

24:50.715 --> 24:52.152
Now just back off and let me get high.

24:52.154 --> 24:52.985
So what?

24:52.987 --> 24:53.818
You needed more money?

24:53.820 --> 24:54.651
How'd you get more money?

24:54.653 --> 24:55.554
Are you holding out on me?

24:55.556 --> 24:57.637
Look, dude I took care of it all right.

24:57.639 --> 24:58.621
So just chill out.

24:58.623 --> 24:59.454
Chill out.

24:59.456 --> 25:00.287
Chill out.

25:00.289 --> 25:01.782
No, no, I can't chill out.

25:01.784 --> 25:02.615
What did you do?

25:02.617 --> 25:03.448
Are we in trouble?

25:03.450 --> 25:05.271
Why does everything have
to be so dramatic with you?

25:05.273 --> 25:06.104
All right?

25:06.106 --> 25:07.189
You sound like Javier right now.

25:07.191 --> 25:08.108
Just relax.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.169
Oh god.

25:12.171 --> 25:13.338
You killed him, didn't you?

25:13.340 --> 25:14.222
What are we gonna do?

25:14.224 --> 25:15.193
What are we gonna do?

25:15.195 --> 25:17.918
Look man, the guy just raised
his prices a little okay.

25:17.920 --> 25:20.594
I got the dope, didn't I?

25:20.596 --> 25:22.518
That was all I had.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.110
I took everything from my dad's stash.

25:24.112 --> 25:26.281
You know I can't even pay you back.

25:26.283 --> 25:28.366
I'm dead broke right now.

25:30.976 --> 25:32.976
How much do we even get?

25:38.699 --> 25:40.198
The hell is that?

25:40.200 --> 25:41.156
What does it look like?

25:41.158 --> 25:43.953
You said it costs more money
so where's the rest of it?

25:43.955 --> 25:45.308
Don't mess with me, Chase.

25:45.310 --> 25:48.836
Look, I've had a rough day all right.

25:48.838 --> 25:50.564
I just wanna get high right now

25:50.566 --> 25:55.066
and forget that I ever even
woke up this morning okay.

25:59.595 --> 26:02.017
When you decide to grow
a pair and you're the one

26:02.019 --> 26:03.805
that's out there dealing
with the dope dealers,

26:03.807 --> 26:06.001
then I'll actually entertain
a conversation with you.

26:06.003 --> 26:07.596
Okay?

26:07.598 --> 26:09.193
These guys don't mess around
when it comes to this stuff.

26:09.195 --> 26:10.026
All right?

26:10.028 --> 26:11.142
And I'm out there taking all the risks

26:11.144 --> 26:12.109
while you sit here on your ass all day

26:12.111 --> 26:13.564
and collect your welfare.

26:13.566 --> 26:15.049
This was all I could get.

26:15.051 --> 26:18.468
So do you wanna keep getting high or not?

26:27.631 --> 26:31.661
I don't know about you,
man, but that's not enough.

26:31.663 --> 26:33.016
I'm really starting to hurt.

26:33.018 --> 26:34.589
Yeah and so am I.

26:34.591 --> 26:35.957
I don't know how long I can do this.

26:35.959 --> 26:38.717
I need more and this is not
enough to last 'til tomorrow.

26:38.719 --> 26:41.302
So what do you want me to do?

26:45.125 --> 26:47.272
I don't know how long I can do this.

26:47.274 --> 26:51.007
This small time nickel and dime bag stuff.

26:51.009 --> 26:52.759
Living $20 at a time.

26:55.746 --> 26:57.868
We need to take it up a notch.

26:57.870 --> 27:00.737
What do you mean take it up a notch?

27:00.739 --> 27:04.684
There are some days if I don't get high,

27:04.686 --> 27:07.349
I feel like I might die.

27:07.351 --> 27:09.172
So then why don't you quit, huh?

27:09.174 --> 27:10.084
Move out.

27:10.086 --> 27:11.920
Get your little life figured
out or something like that

27:11.922 --> 27:13.012
and leave me the hell alone.

27:13.014 --> 27:14.404
I am serious right now.

27:14.406 --> 27:15.784
Well what do you want
me to do about it, man?

27:15.786 --> 27:16.624
We're broke.

27:16.626 --> 27:17.632
We don't have rent.

27:17.634 --> 27:19.312
I don't even know what I'm
gonna be eating tomorrow.

27:19.314 --> 27:22.951
How can you think about food right now?

27:22.953 --> 27:25.516
Look man, I'm gonna be at
the welfare office tomorrow.

27:25.518 --> 27:26.349
Okay?

27:26.351 --> 27:28.229
I'll fill out paperwork
and I'll see what I can do.

27:28.231 --> 27:29.398
We'll be fine.

27:38.842 --> 27:43.759
Why would you be at the
welfare office if you have a job?

27:45.714 --> 27:47.200
You got fired again, didn't you, Chase?

27:47.202 --> 27:48.268
I didn't get fired.

27:48.270 --> 27:49.876
All right listen look.

27:49.878 --> 27:51.186
It's my boss, all right.

27:51.188 --> 27:53.116
He's had it out for me since day one.

27:53.118 --> 27:54.892
No one can stand their boss.

27:54.894 --> 27:57.441
Look man, it's not my fault all right.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.644
The guy's like hated me for
years or something like that.

27:59.646 --> 28:00.904
I don't know.

28:00.906 --> 28:02.072
And how am I supposed to get any work done

28:02.074 --> 28:03.256
when he's breathing down
my neck all the time?

28:03.258 --> 28:04.648
He's impossible to work for.

28:04.650 --> 28:05.481
Yeah right.

28:05.483 --> 28:07.421
Just like your last job
and your job before that.

28:07.423 --> 28:09.448
It's always someone else
who has a problem with you.

28:09.450 --> 28:13.447
Have you ever thought just
maybe that the problem is you?

28:13.449 --> 28:14.300
Me?

28:14.302 --> 28:15.304
Me?

28:15.306 --> 28:16.912
Really?

28:16.914 --> 28:19.032
Look man, I do everything
around here okay.

28:19.034 --> 28:20.992
I work my ass off all day
and I get all the drugs

28:20.994 --> 28:21.916
and what do you do?

28:21.918 --> 28:22.755
You do nothing.

28:22.757 --> 28:26.259
You sit here and you just
smoke the drugs and that's it.

28:26.261 --> 28:28.348
Why don't you do something for once?

28:28.350 --> 28:30.267
You think of something.

28:52.237 --> 28:53.068
This sucks.

28:53.070 --> 28:54.519
I seriously need to check my Facebook

28:54.521 --> 28:55.931
and I wanted to post that video

28:55.933 --> 28:57.707
we shot yesterday at the tracks.

28:57.709 --> 28:59.225
Dude, you gotta chill down all right.

28:59.227 --> 29:00.123
Chill out.

29:00.125 --> 29:01.656
This is nothing all right.

29:01.658 --> 29:02.534
Calm down.

29:02.536 --> 29:04.032
And you're not gonna have
any hits, by the way.

29:04.034 --> 29:05.436
You're just a big ole loser.

29:05.438 --> 29:07.236
I'm the popular one all right.

29:07.238 --> 29:08.069
Yeah right.

29:08.071 --> 29:08.902
I've seen your posts.

29:08.904 --> 29:10.056
They're terrible.

29:10.058 --> 29:11.832
Nobody cares about BMX riding.

29:11.834 --> 29:13.032
That's where you're wrong, man.

29:13.034 --> 29:15.371
That's where you're wrong
because those guys are awesome

29:15.373 --> 29:16.572
and they put their life on the line

29:16.574 --> 29:18.330
every single time they get on a bike.

29:18.332 --> 29:20.190
Way better than stoner skateboarding.

29:20.192 --> 29:22.386
Yeah, skateboarding is
definitely more chill,

29:22.388 --> 29:23.597
which makes it cooler.

29:23.599 --> 29:25.686
Seriously though, what did
we do before cell phones?

29:25.688 --> 29:27.486
I'm bored out of my mind right now.

29:27.488 --> 29:28.949
I'd even play chess I'm so bored.

29:28.951 --> 29:31.734
Dude, Xbox, Xbox, Xbox.

29:31.736 --> 29:33.954
Plus, if you're so bored,
why don't you go get it?

29:33.956 --> 29:34.890
It's in the drawer.

29:34.892 --> 29:36.321
You're going insane.

29:36.323 --> 29:37.573
Yeah, I know.

29:38.830 --> 29:40.796
Come on, let's play this game.

29:40.798 --> 29:43.131
Let's get serious right now.

29:43.977 --> 29:46.148
You're not even playing the game right.

29:46.150 --> 29:47.732
You're not even playing the game at all.

29:47.734 --> 29:48.919
Line up the balls, idiot.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.300
All right, all right.

29:50.302 --> 29:51.302
Let's do it.

29:52.533 --> 29:53.364
I don't know how to set it up.

29:53.366 --> 29:54.197
You set it up.

29:54.199 --> 29:55.030
I don't know how to set it up.

29:55.032 --> 29:55.863
You set it up.

29:55.865 --> 29:57.145
No, you set it up.

29:57.147 --> 30:00.314
Dude, I don't know how to play this.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.946
Oh, just a reminder that
I'm working overtime tomorrow,

30:04.948 --> 30:07.355
so you'll have to run errands for us.

30:07.357 --> 30:09.407
Oh and I won't be home for dinner,

30:09.409 --> 30:11.687
so you're gonna have to get groceries.

30:11.689 --> 30:15.670
There should be enough charcoal
if you wanna use the grill.

30:15.672 --> 30:16.839
I always do.

30:17.821 --> 30:21.539
Would it kill you to eat
a vegetable once in awhile?

30:21.541 --> 30:22.836
Nope.

30:22.838 --> 30:24.421
Real men eat steak.

30:28.526 --> 30:32.928
Enough with the hat
in the house already.

30:32.930 --> 30:35.940
It's a wonder why you haven't
had a heart attack yet

30:35.942 --> 30:39.035
and Theo's so skinny,
the way you boys eat.

30:39.037 --> 30:41.037
Like father, like son.

30:45.972 --> 30:47.746
Dude, what was up with
your dad tonight though?

30:47.748 --> 30:49.809
He seemed really pissed off.

30:49.811 --> 30:50.986
So did your mom.

30:50.988 --> 30:53.232
Well your mom always
seems kind of pissed off.

30:53.234 --> 30:54.381
They're always pissed off.

30:54.383 --> 30:55.834
What else is new?

30:55.836 --> 30:59.086
Yeah, but even more so tonight.

30:59.088 --> 31:00.046
Yeah, I don't know.

31:00.048 --> 31:01.690
I think they've been
fighting a lot lately.

31:01.692 --> 31:03.337
I think it has something
to do with the ranch

31:03.339 --> 31:04.918
and they're being really cryptic about it,

31:04.920 --> 31:07.162
but I could care less 'cause
I'm out of here in two years.

31:07.164 --> 31:08.746
Got ya.

31:08.748 --> 31:12.693
Are they having some kind
of financial troubles?

31:12.695 --> 31:13.526
Beats me.

31:13.528 --> 31:15.216
They never tell me anything like ever.

31:15.218 --> 31:16.329
They still treat me like a child

31:16.331 --> 31:18.669
and it's getting really old.

31:18.671 --> 31:21.850
Can you go
check on them please?

31:21.852 --> 31:22.882
No, I can't check on them.

31:22.884 --> 31:24.801
They're not 10 anymore.

31:27.147 --> 31:28.186
What do you think they're doing in there

31:28.188 --> 31:30.381
that requires me to check
on them every five minutes?

31:30.383 --> 31:32.555
Think they're burning down the house?

31:32.557 --> 31:35.146
No, I'm afraid that's
something that you'll do.

31:35.148 --> 31:36.231
Yeah right.

31:38.582 --> 31:39.915
Would you relax?

31:42.888 --> 31:47.750
It would just break my heart
if something were to happen.

31:47.752 --> 31:49.931
As polite as that kid seems,

31:49.933 --> 31:52.919
I know he hangs out with a bad crowd.

31:52.921 --> 31:56.583
I know his brother is in a
gang and I know they do stuff.

31:56.585 --> 31:58.450
I'm not stupid.

31:58.452 --> 32:02.626
And I know for a fact that
that brother has been in jail.

32:02.628 --> 32:05.786
Don't you think you're being
a little bit judgmental here.

32:05.788 --> 32:08.687
You can't prove one thing
against that kid and his family

32:08.689 --> 32:10.514
and I happened to know they
have a pretty rough time,

32:10.516 --> 32:13.667
especially with that kid's
dad being addicted to drugs.

32:13.669 --> 32:14.641
That's not our Theo.

32:14.643 --> 32:17.926
He wouldn't mess around
with his life like that.

32:17.928 --> 32:18.842
How do you know?

32:18.844 --> 32:19.694
Trust me.

32:19.696 --> 32:21.470
I think your mom hates me, bro.

32:21.472 --> 32:22.303
What?

32:22.305 --> 32:23.136
Shut up, man.

32:23.138 --> 32:23.969
No, she doesn't.

32:23.971 --> 32:24.802
She does.

32:24.804 --> 32:25.642
She does.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.768
She looks at me all funny all the time.

32:27.770 --> 32:29.011
Like I did something.

32:29.013 --> 32:30.763
I didn't do anything.

32:31.725 --> 32:32.794
She doesn't hate you, man.

32:32.796 --> 32:34.678
She's just nervous and she worries a lot.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.597
I don't know blame her.

32:37.929 --> 32:39.174
Yeah.

32:39.176 --> 32:40.075
Wow.

32:40.077 --> 32:41.722
She looks at me really weird.

32:41.724 --> 32:43.507
Like super weird.

32:43.509 --> 32:45.691
Like she doesn't trust me or something.

32:45.693 --> 32:47.862
Dude, I haven't done anything.

32:47.864 --> 32:48.697
Not yet.

32:50.217 --> 32:51.547
You're paranoid.

32:51.549 --> 32:52.494
It's your shot.

32:52.496 --> 32:53.839
All right, all right.

32:53.841 --> 32:57.431
I am sick of this tough
guy approach to parenting.

32:57.433 --> 32:58.662
Show him some discipline.

32:58.664 --> 32:59.495
What do you want me to do?

32:59.497 --> 33:01.497
He hasn't done anything.

33:11.682 --> 33:13.400
What's that?

33:13.402 --> 33:14.428
Did they go outside?

33:14.430 --> 33:16.781
Could you go check?

33:16.783 --> 33:19.950
It's just the wind hitting the gate.

33:21.522 --> 33:23.692
Such a stomachache.

33:23.694 --> 33:25.516
Probably from all those
drugs you've been taking.

33:25.518 --> 33:28.037
No wonder why you have a stomachache.

33:28.039 --> 33:32.456
Please don't throw guilt
on me right now all right.

33:33.934 --> 33:34.765
Enough.

33:34.767 --> 33:36.660
And besides, Doctor Grant says

33:36.662 --> 33:39.764
that my dosage is on the low end compared

33:39.766 --> 33:42.104
to what other people in my condition take.

33:42.106 --> 33:43.106
Condition?

33:44.090 --> 33:47.389
Do you know how much stress I am in?

33:47.391 --> 33:48.816
What stress?

33:48.818 --> 33:50.227
You sit around home all day.

33:50.229 --> 33:52.146
I work six days a week.

33:54.310 --> 33:56.972
You have the nerve to say that to me?

33:56.974 --> 33:59.912
I work, too, and I take
care of this house.

33:59.914 --> 34:01.294
I mean, I cook.

34:01.296 --> 34:03.873
How do you think your
work clothes get clean

34:03.875 --> 34:05.276
and back into your drawer?

34:05.278 --> 34:09.103
Do you think that's the laundry fairy?

34:09.106 --> 34:09.937
You know what?

34:09.938 --> 34:11.252
You are no help.

34:11.254 --> 34:13.556
Go read your paper.

34:19.434 --> 34:20.429
I know what we can do, man.

34:20.431 --> 34:21.614
I got a plan.

34:21.617 --> 34:22.744
Yeah?

34:22.746 --> 34:23.730
Let's see if you can use this

34:23.732 --> 34:25.231
little brain of yours for once.

34:25.233 --> 34:27.710
What do we do when we need something?

34:27.713 --> 34:29.130
I hate riddles.

34:30.174 --> 34:31.467
What?

34:31.469 --> 34:32.552
We take it.

34:33.666 --> 34:36.340
You have lost your mind.

34:36.342 --> 34:37.239
What are you talking about?

34:37.241 --> 34:39.039
I'm not going after some dope dealers.

34:39.041 --> 34:40.120
Are you insane?

34:40.121 --> 34:40.953
They have guns.

34:40.955 --> 34:42.376
They have no regard for human life.

34:42.378 --> 34:44.215
If you wanna go after them, be my guest,

34:44.217 --> 34:49.060
but I just like to get high
and be alive so I can get high.

34:49.062 --> 34:50.835
Not the drug dealers, numb nuts.

34:50.838 --> 34:52.312
What do you think I'm stupid or something?

34:52.313 --> 34:54.088
Like I'm just gonna go
in there guns blazing.

34:54.090 --> 34:55.504
Well you're sound a
little stupid right now.

34:55.505 --> 34:57.340
Think about it, man.

34:57.342 --> 34:59.299
You know how many rich,
defenseless little families

34:59.301 --> 35:01.663
live just a few miles from here?

35:01.665 --> 35:02.496
Think about it.

35:02.498 --> 35:03.436
We scope a couple places out.

35:03.438 --> 35:05.024
Figure out who's home and who's not.

35:05.026 --> 35:05.857
We go in.

35:05.859 --> 35:07.677
We help ourselves to some valuables.

35:07.679 --> 35:09.184
I mean we pick a place
that's far enough away

35:09.186 --> 35:10.781
that it'll take forever for like cops

35:10.783 --> 35:12.054
or anyone else to get to.

35:12.056 --> 35:13.792
It's easy money, man.

35:13.794 --> 35:14.931
I don't know.

35:14.933 --> 35:16.095
I mean we're on parole.

35:16.097 --> 35:17.860
This would be my third strike.

35:17.862 --> 35:22.612
All right well if you have
a better plan, I'm all ears.

35:27.838 --> 35:30.294
It would have to be in the hills,

35:30.296 --> 35:31.387
but those folks are the type

35:31.389 --> 35:33.089
that have guns under their pillows.

35:33.091 --> 35:33.922
Oh please.

35:33.924 --> 35:35.298
Like they've ever shot it.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.378
What about parole?

35:36.380 --> 35:38.430
That's exactly my point.

35:38.432 --> 35:40.595
This is really low risk.

35:40.597 --> 35:41.843
You know a lot of these places,

35:41.845 --> 35:44.096
the closest neighbors are like miles away.

35:44.098 --> 35:45.646
It's the easiest money
we've ever made, man.

35:45.648 --> 35:48.414
In and out before anyone
knows that we're there.

35:48.416 --> 35:50.276
All right, we can take whatever we want.

35:50.278 --> 35:52.748
Those people in the hills have money, man.

35:52.750 --> 35:55.854
I mean at this point what
else do we have to lose?

35:55.856 --> 35:57.175
It's tempting.

35:57.177 --> 36:02.010
I'm talking like cash,
jewelry, iPhones, whatever.

36:02.012 --> 36:06.390
Look, the best part is
if we do this right,

36:06.392 --> 36:09.617
no one gets hurt, no one gets caught,

36:09.619 --> 36:13.202
and no one will even
know that we're there.

36:15.899 --> 36:19.101
It's not so much of a bad idea I guess.

36:19.103 --> 36:20.662
You and I both know
dudes are gonna front

36:20.664 --> 36:21.812
for stuff like this.

36:21.814 --> 36:22.645
Javier's brother has...

36:22.647 --> 36:23.478
No, no, no, no, no.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.311
Listen, listen.

36:24.313 --> 36:27.195
Javier's brother, his brother,
has a crooked pawn shop.

36:27.197 --> 36:29.619
Like a no questions asked
type of situation all right.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.405
I can even get Javier to help us out.

36:31.407 --> 36:33.588
That guy would do anything for a bump.

36:33.590 --> 36:35.160
You know three sets of eyes
are gonna be a lot better

36:35.162 --> 36:37.175
than two in something like this

36:37.177 --> 36:38.761
and he can help us carry more.

36:38.763 --> 36:40.068
No way.

36:40.070 --> 36:41.727
Javier is wack.

36:41.729 --> 36:44.184
I never thought I would
say this my whole life,

36:44.186 --> 36:46.284
but that guy smokes way too much.

36:46.286 --> 36:48.433
See, he's a really great guy,

36:48.435 --> 36:51.024
but he's not the most inconspicuous.

36:51.026 --> 36:51.912
He's not that bad.

36:51.914 --> 36:53.485
Not that bad.

36:53.487 --> 36:55.409
The guy hit an old woman
in a grocery store.

36:55.411 --> 36:56.352
And that laugh?

36:56.354 --> 36:57.696
Not so subtle.

36:57.698 --> 36:59.399
Look man, he'll be fine all right.

36:59.401 --> 37:00.444
He'll do whatever I say.

37:00.446 --> 37:02.952
He always listens to me.

37:02.954 --> 37:06.841
Look, I know that he's
your dear old friend,

37:06.843 --> 37:08.843
but Javier has problems.

37:09.986 --> 37:11.231
He'll get us caught.

37:11.233 --> 37:13.536
Look man, we need Javier okay.

37:13.538 --> 37:14.580
It'll be a lot easier that way

37:14.582 --> 37:16.224
to get into his brother's shop.

37:16.226 --> 37:18.924
I mean unless you wanna do like
a garage sale in the alley.

37:18.926 --> 37:20.093
He'll be fine.

37:21.527 --> 37:22.358
I don't know.

37:22.360 --> 37:23.628
I mean he's cool but...

37:23.630 --> 37:24.936
Look he's in all right.

37:24.938 --> 37:26.460
He's in.

37:26.462 --> 37:28.428
Three heads are a lot better
than two in this type of thing.

37:28.430 --> 37:29.856
He'll be fine.

37:29.858 --> 37:31.860
He won't be a problem.

37:31.862 --> 37:34.585
We need the extra hands.

37:34.587 --> 37:36.470
If we're gonna do it,
then we gotta do it right.

37:36.472 --> 37:37.884
No hiccups.

37:37.886 --> 37:42.886
Yeah, 'cause I totally wanna
do this the wrong way, moron.

37:43.538 --> 37:44.484
Fine.

37:44.486 --> 37:46.740
I don't know how I always
let you talk me into this.

37:46.742 --> 37:50.843
It's because I'm the brains
and you are the welfare check.

37:50.845 --> 37:51.983
Now let's go.

37:51.985 --> 37:52.816
What?

37:52.818 --> 37:54.855
We're gonna do it now?

37:54.857 --> 37:56.333
We're doing it tonight.

37:56.335 --> 37:57.166
Come on.

37:57.168 --> 37:58.585
Let's get Javier.

37:59.512 --> 38:02.012
I'm gonna take a dump first.

38:03.363 --> 38:04.199
Do you really think your dad's

38:04.201 --> 38:05.593
gonna get you an Xbox?

38:05.595 --> 38:06.426
I don't know.

38:06.428 --> 38:07.259
Probably not.

38:07.261 --> 38:09.113
It sounds too good to be true.

38:09.115 --> 38:11.651
And Eileen would probably
convince him to shoot it down.

38:11.653 --> 38:13.955
I bet my dad would've
hated stuff like that.

38:13.957 --> 38:14.788
Like what?

38:14.790 --> 38:17.531
Like Xboxes, phones,
and technology and stuff.

38:17.533 --> 38:20.498
He didn't even get a computer
'til after he passed.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.583
He never even saw an iPhone.

38:22.585 --> 38:23.882
Yeah, well my dad.

38:23.884 --> 38:27.385
He still thinks chopping wood
is a better use of my time.

38:27.387 --> 38:30.275
At least you have a dad.

38:30.277 --> 38:32.527
Dude, you know what I mean.

38:41.514 --> 38:44.959
If they scratch the felt
on that table one more time,

38:44.961 --> 38:46.544
I am gonna lose it.

38:52.148 --> 38:54.419
And I'm not paying for it again.

38:54.421 --> 38:55.754
I've had enough.

38:56.660 --> 38:58.017
You're paying for it.

38:58.019 --> 39:01.102
You're the one who put them in there.

39:03.296 --> 39:04.629
Can you hear me?

39:05.859 --> 39:07.648
Yeah fine.

39:07.650 --> 39:10.201
What did I say?

39:10.203 --> 39:11.281
Pool table scratch.

39:11.283 --> 39:12.783
I'm paying for it.

39:20.759 --> 39:23.092
Mister Allen called today.

39:25.716 --> 39:28.500
You know Mister Allen from the bank?

39:28.502 --> 39:30.106
The only other man in my life

39:30.108 --> 39:33.108
that has the ability to piss me off.

39:34.212 --> 39:36.603
Well what are you gonna do?

39:36.605 --> 39:40.483
Are we just gonna sit
here and be intimidated

39:40.485 --> 39:42.915
listening to that man,
that jerk or whoever

39:42.917 --> 39:46.084
'cause you say you're gonna handle it?

39:49.601 --> 39:51.651
I told you not to worry about it.

39:51.653 --> 39:54.070
Well I am worried about it.

39:55.832 --> 40:00.003
I don't think you realize
how serious this is.

40:00.005 --> 40:02.088
We could lose this house.

40:03.600 --> 40:04.485
He's annoying.

40:04.487 --> 40:05.853
Yeah, but you're lucky.

40:05.855 --> 40:07.712
Look, you have all of this.

40:07.714 --> 40:09.633
I have nothing.

40:09.635 --> 40:11.385
So, it could be a lot worse.

40:11.387 --> 40:12.441
What does that mean?

40:12.443 --> 40:15.575
At least you know you're
gonna be here for awhile.

40:15.577 --> 40:16.653
What?

40:16.655 --> 40:20.265
When I tell you I'm gonna
handle something, I handle it.

40:20.267 --> 40:21.803
How many times I gotta tell you that?

40:21.805 --> 40:22.751
I'll handle it.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.453
Yeah, well how many times?

40:24.455 --> 40:25.389
I mean you just sit there

40:25.391 --> 40:28.177
and you let things roll off your back

40:28.179 --> 40:32.638
as long as you have your
chair and your drink.

40:32.640 --> 40:35.361
As soon as I get the okay for the city,

40:35.363 --> 40:36.861
they'll issue me the permit.

40:36.863 --> 40:39.035
When that happens,
they'll spot me the money.

40:39.037 --> 40:42.120
How many times I gotta tell you that?

40:44.561 --> 40:45.394
When?

40:46.736 --> 40:47.569
Hm?

40:48.918 --> 40:50.751
I think we're moving, man.

40:50.753 --> 40:51.665
Moving?

40:51.667 --> 40:52.923
Like down the street.

40:52.925 --> 40:53.824
Out of town.

40:53.826 --> 40:54.657
What?

40:54.659 --> 40:55.492
Why?

40:57.114 --> 40:59.200
Mom's taking the turn for the worse

40:59.202 --> 41:00.940
and she needs to be
closer to better hospitals

41:00.942 --> 41:02.800
and better care and we just can't afford

41:02.802 --> 41:05.404
to be out here anymore
with her in her condition.

41:05.406 --> 41:06.568
All right, I'm sorry.

41:06.570 --> 41:07.923
Is she gonna be okay?

41:07.925 --> 41:09.928
Yeah, for now.

41:09.930 --> 41:11.216
My brother's been paying the bills.

41:11.218 --> 41:13.024
She can get the care that she deserves,

41:13.026 --> 41:14.692
but the doctor says she needs to go

41:14.694 --> 41:16.420
to L.A. for better treatment,

41:16.422 --> 41:17.848
and she can't keep going
back and forth anymore,

41:17.850 --> 41:21.669
so she might move in with
my aunt and uncle in Venice.

41:21.671 --> 41:23.088
I'm sorry, man.

41:24.498 --> 41:25.528
Me too.

41:25.530 --> 41:27.415
I talked to the guy today.

41:27.417 --> 41:29.104
We're a go.

41:29.106 --> 41:32.201
Oh but until the end of this week

41:32.203 --> 41:35.179
and then that'll turn into the next week

41:35.181 --> 41:37.012
and then that'll be the next week

41:37.014 --> 41:39.904
and the next week and the next week.

41:39.906 --> 41:41.081
I'm really sick of this.

41:41.083 --> 41:41.992
When are you gonna do this?

41:41.994 --> 41:43.588
I don't think you realize
how serious this is.

41:43.590 --> 41:44.812
I mean what about Theo?

41:44.814 --> 41:46.314
What about Theo?

41:47.250 --> 41:48.376
I don't think you realize

41:48.378 --> 41:50.861
that you're toying with his future, Gary.

41:50.863 --> 41:52.183
So what about you?

41:52.185 --> 41:53.164
What about me?

41:53.166 --> 41:54.244
What are you gonna do?

41:54.246 --> 41:56.261
Not sure yet.

41:56.263 --> 41:58.600
My brother might have some
kind of connections in Venice

41:58.602 --> 42:00.186
with his friend's autobody shop.

42:00.188 --> 42:02.331
They've been talking about
getting into business forever.

42:02.333 --> 42:05.368
Like pimping out cars or whatever.

42:05.370 --> 42:07.108
So I might get a job with him.

42:07.110 --> 42:08.417
He's already taught me a lot.

42:08.419 --> 42:09.867
I thought your brother
was a drug dealer.

42:09.869 --> 42:10.700
Shut up, man.

42:10.702 --> 42:11.533
What?

42:11.535 --> 42:12.366
He is.

42:12.368 --> 42:13.199
He's not.

42:13.201 --> 42:14.657
He's more like a business man.

42:14.659 --> 42:15.966
He's an entrepreneur.

42:15.968 --> 42:16.938
Right.

42:16.940 --> 42:18.023
Entrepreneur.

42:19.689 --> 42:22.338
Listen, he's doing what
he has to do for all of us.

42:22.340 --> 42:23.363
He's taking risks.

42:23.365 --> 42:25.627
And he's doing it for me and my mom.

42:25.629 --> 42:26.478
I get it.

42:26.480 --> 42:28.063
It's just it sucks.

42:29.292 --> 42:32.178
Yeah, I know, but
things will get better.

42:32.180 --> 42:34.002
I mean it's Venice Beach.

42:34.004 --> 42:35.706
Have you ever been down to L.A.?

42:35.708 --> 42:37.894
There's so many babes, dude.

42:37.896 --> 42:38.886
Right.

42:38.888 --> 42:40.806
The babes 'cause you're so popular

42:40.808 --> 42:42.259
with the girls in our class.

42:42.261 --> 42:44.722
They're just banging down your door huh?

42:44.724 --> 42:45.834
Wow.

42:45.836 --> 42:47.074
Whatever.

42:47.076 --> 42:48.462
You know what I mean.

42:48.464 --> 42:51.005
Come on, I'm trying to stay positive.

42:51.007 --> 42:52.410
All right babes.

42:52.412 --> 42:53.387
Got it.

42:53.389 --> 42:54.838
Babes.

42:54.840 --> 42:57.083
Theo will be fine.

42:57.085 --> 42:59.629
I told you the day that
he moved into this house

42:59.631 --> 43:01.706
that he wouldn't have
to worry about anything.

43:01.708 --> 43:03.042
Fine.

43:03.044 --> 43:04.377
I'll just worry.

43:05.560 --> 43:08.761
You'll be the laid back parent.

43:08.763 --> 43:11.247
Dad who buys presents
when anything goes wrong.

43:11.249 --> 43:12.082
Shut up.

43:14.971 --> 43:15.804
No.

43:17.525 --> 43:20.192
I mean you promised him an Xbox.

43:21.425 --> 43:23.258
I mean how is that any different

43:23.260 --> 43:27.343
from having his face in
his stupid phone all day?

43:28.589 --> 43:32.319
You take one toy away and
then you give him another?

43:32.321 --> 43:34.911
How stupid can you be?

43:34.913 --> 43:37.203
How 'bout a book for once?

43:37.205 --> 43:38.980
Boy's brain's gonna turn into mush.

43:38.982 --> 43:40.215
Sh.

43:40.217 --> 43:41.403
He's gonna hear you.

43:41.405 --> 43:42.927
Good, fine.

43:42.929 --> 43:44.943
Let him hear it.

43:44.945 --> 43:47.492
Why can't I get him nice things?

43:47.494 --> 43:49.431
So he's had a little
bit of trouble lately.

43:49.433 --> 43:50.307
He's a teenager.

43:50.309 --> 43:51.140
That's what they do.

43:51.142 --> 43:52.875
They mess up and they learn from it.

43:52.877 --> 43:54.459
He's a good kid.

43:54.461 --> 43:56.607
I know it in my guts.

43:56.609 --> 43:59.463
Well I hate to break
it to your manly gut,

43:59.465 --> 44:02.163
but it isn't that he's
just getting into trouble.

44:02.165 --> 44:04.263
His grades are slipping.

44:04.265 --> 44:06.124
He's not inspired by anything.

44:06.126 --> 44:08.127
All he wants to do is keep
hanging out with that kid,

44:08.129 --> 44:10.816
whose brother I know is in a gang.

44:10.818 --> 44:14.391
He's not motivated to do anything.

44:14.393 --> 44:15.554
He needs a strong father.

44:15.556 --> 44:17.991
He needs discipline.

44:17.993 --> 44:21.591
Okay, I'll take him to
work with me this weekend.

44:21.593 --> 44:22.426
Great.

44:24.172 --> 44:25.089
Hard labor.

44:26.402 --> 44:29.833
What is it with you and men and torture?

44:29.835 --> 44:31.866
Builds character.

44:31.868 --> 44:32.701
Right.

44:34.574 --> 44:35.657
Unbelievable.

44:37.793 --> 44:39.496
I mean when are you gonna care, Gary?

44:39.498 --> 44:42.336
I mean you don't care
about anything anymore.

44:42.338 --> 44:47.017
You used to care about
this house and Theo and me.

44:47.019 --> 44:48.685
We don't go to the movies anymore

44:48.687 --> 44:51.241
like as a family like we used to.

44:51.243 --> 44:54.053
That used to be your favorite thing.

44:54.055 --> 44:58.888
You spend more time with the
chickens than you do with me.

45:01.094 --> 45:02.006
You just sit there.

45:02.008 --> 45:04.273
Everything just rolls off your back.

45:04.275 --> 45:05.844
I told you I'll handle it.

45:05.846 --> 45:08.704
Yeah, you'll handle it.

45:08.706 --> 45:10.180
Fine.

45:10.182 --> 45:11.129
You know what?

45:11.131 --> 45:12.305
I need you to do something.

45:12.307 --> 45:14.493
I need you to be a father okay.

45:14.495 --> 45:16.495
Will you just shut up?

45:17.496 --> 45:21.020
Not when it comes to my family I don't.

45:21.022 --> 45:21.855
All right?

45:23.708 --> 45:26.381
I mean that kid has a second
chance to have a family

45:26.383 --> 45:30.017
and it would break my heart
if he is denied a father.

45:30.019 --> 45:33.686
Look, I love Theo as
if he was my own kid.

45:35.357 --> 45:36.628
You know that.

45:36.630 --> 45:38.702
I don't want anybody to mess with that.

45:38.704 --> 45:41.454
Well then start acting like it.

45:43.841 --> 45:44.674
Fine.

45:49.156 --> 45:50.073
I'm done.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.307
So when is all this going down?

45:53.309 --> 45:54.554
Do you have a date yet?

45:54.556 --> 45:58.658
No, not sure yet, but I
think sooner than later.

45:58.660 --> 46:00.841
Eddie's already been back
and forth making arrangements

46:00.843 --> 46:03.319
and somebody already wants
to move into our apartment,

46:03.321 --> 46:06.073
so I'm thinking a month, maybe two.

46:06.075 --> 46:07.298
Wow.

46:07.300 --> 46:08.941
Okay then soon.

46:08.943 --> 46:10.022
Yeah.

46:10.024 --> 46:11.750
I'm sorry, man.

46:11.752 --> 46:15.173
But hey, we'll see each other soon though

46:15.175 --> 46:17.725
and we'll hang out like every
single day before I leave.

46:17.727 --> 46:20.114
Looks like I'll be
visiting you in L.A. then.

46:20.116 --> 46:21.977
Better get a room ready for me.

46:21.979 --> 46:23.030
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

46:23.032 --> 46:24.518
Who said you're invited?

46:24.520 --> 46:25.520
You loser.

46:27.316 --> 46:29.066
Dude, how do you play this thing?

46:29.068 --> 46:31.333
I've never played this.

47:39.783 --> 47:41.533
It's open.

47:42.693 --> 47:44.810
Let's go Buzz Lightyear.

47:51.358 --> 47:54.025
Who leaves a door open at night?

48:22.310 --> 48:23.143
Sh.

48:26.462 --> 48:27.545
Hey.

48:28.503 --> 48:29.967
Theo.

48:29.969 --> 48:30.802
Theo.

48:32.299 --> 48:33.336
What?

48:33.338 --> 48:35.052
Did you hear that?

48:39.158 --> 48:40.584
Hey.

48:40.586 --> 48:42.144
Hey.

48:42.146 --> 48:45.216
Tell the boys to stop making noise.

48:45.218 --> 48:48.801
It's just the
kids horsing around.

48:54.038 --> 48:56.205
Hey, it's late.

48:57.843 --> 49:00.216
Tell them to go to bed.

49:00.218 --> 49:04.452
All right, all
right, all right, all right.

49:06.050 --> 49:08.856
Theo, you heard that.

49:21.599 --> 49:22.677
The door's locked.

49:22.679 --> 49:23.846
Move.

49:25.620 --> 49:28.674
Come on, come on, come on.

50:08.143 --> 50:11.226
The hell are you guys doing?

50:16.061 --> 50:16.894
Gar?

50:38.548 --> 50:39.381
Gar?

50:50.413 --> 50:51.246
Gary?

52:06.884 --> 52:07.800
Gary?

52:45.156 --> 52:47.142
Shut up.

52:50.564 --> 52:52.194
That was awesome.

52:52.196 --> 52:53.898
Can we get high now?

53:09.822 --> 53:10.994
Let's go.

53:10.996 --> 53:11.829
Come on.

53:13.888 --> 53:14.721
Come on.

53:53.984 --> 53:58.169
Yo, it is like the Bates
Motel in here, you guys.

53:58.171 --> 53:59.921
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

54:02.719 --> 54:05.105
What the hell are you doing?

54:05.107 --> 54:06.357
This is dope.

54:07.651 --> 54:10.121
All right man, rack 'em up.

54:54.391 --> 54:56.744
I think we should get
the hell out of here.

54:56.746 --> 54:58.229
We should get the hell out of here.

54:58.231 --> 54:59.062
Yeah, you're right.

54:59.064 --> 54:59.981
Let's just.

55:00.947 --> 55:01.778
I don't know.

55:01.780 --> 55:02.611
Grab some stuff then.

55:02.613 --> 55:04.484
Sh, y'all hear that?

55:04.486 --> 55:05.961
Shut up.

55:05.963 --> 55:07.350
Okay, just grab something.

55:07.352 --> 55:08.322
Come on find something.

55:08.324 --> 55:11.074
Let's grab some stuff.

55:15.041 --> 55:17.247
Hey numb nuts, it's too big.

55:17.249 --> 55:19.444
Look for something different then.

55:19.446 --> 55:21.436
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:21.438 --> 55:22.695
It's too big.

55:22.697 --> 55:23.530
Ooh.

55:24.873 --> 55:26.403
Why do we roll with this fucking idiot?

55:26.405 --> 55:27.271
I know.

55:27.273 --> 55:28.647
Who knows?

55:28.649 --> 55:30.460
Dude, what are we gonna
do about the dead bodies?

55:38.191 --> 55:39.654
What are we gonna do about 'em?

55:39.656 --> 55:41.129
What are we gonna do
with the dead bodies?

55:41.131 --> 55:41.962
I don't know.

55:41.964 --> 55:44.092
I didn't know that any of
this stuff was gonna go down.

55:44.094 --> 55:46.817
Yeah, again we should
just get out of here.

55:46.819 --> 55:49.087
Yeah, we should.

55:49.089 --> 55:50.081
Knock it off.

55:50.083 --> 55:50.958
Stop.

55:50.960 --> 55:51.871
You had a bug, man.

55:51.873 --> 55:53.021
I do not.

55:53.023 --> 55:56.459
Wow, I never killed anybody before.

55:56.461 --> 55:57.665
It's amazing.

55:57.667 --> 55:59.921
Adrenaline going through your body.

55:59.923 --> 56:01.109
Never?

56:01.111 --> 56:01.944
Really?

56:03.739 --> 56:04.925
Okay but I'm not feeling well.

56:04.927 --> 56:05.758
We should just go.

56:05.760 --> 56:06.591
I'm not either.

56:06.593 --> 56:07.424
Just I don't know.

56:07.426 --> 56:08.667
Look for some money or
something all right.

56:08.669 --> 56:10.036
Let's just go.

56:10.038 --> 56:11.139
Let's look for some money.

56:11.141 --> 56:11.974
Stop it.

56:14.202 --> 56:15.195
Where we gonna find the money?

56:15.197 --> 56:16.083
I don't know.

56:16.085 --> 56:18.711
Just look for it all right.

56:42.138 --> 56:44.120
Where'd you guys come from?

56:44.122 --> 56:46.756
Get off of me.

56:46.758 --> 56:47.997
Got any money in the house?

56:47.999 --> 56:48.830
Don't touch me.

56:48.832 --> 56:49.663
Don't touch me.

56:49.665 --> 56:52.083
Kid, do you
have money in the house?

56:52.085 --> 56:53.356
I don't live here.

56:53.358 --> 56:54.725
I don't live here.

56:54.727 --> 56:56.394
Get off me.

57:18.006 --> 57:18.837
It's not starting.

57:18.839 --> 57:19.670
Come on.

57:19.672 --> 57:21.327
It's not starting.

57:37.914 --> 57:39.379
How you little guys doing?

57:39.381 --> 57:40.647
Leave us alone.

57:40.649 --> 57:41.606
We won't say anything.

57:41.608 --> 57:42.764
Shut up.

57:42.766 --> 57:43.976
So what do we do with them?

57:43.978 --> 57:44.936
I don't know.

57:44.938 --> 57:47.132
Let's make some chicken
noodle soup.

57:47.134 --> 57:48.431
We already got the chickens.

57:48.433 --> 57:50.289
We got the chickens.

57:50.291 --> 57:51.344
We got the chickens.

57:51.346 --> 57:52.179
Shut up.

57:53.075 --> 57:53.908
Sorry.

57:57.779 --> 58:00.089
Get off me.

58:00.091 --> 58:00.924
Ooh.

58:01.772 --> 58:04.194
What you gonna do with that, little man?

58:04.196 --> 58:06.302
Come on.

58:06.304 --> 58:07.137
Come on.

58:11.032 --> 58:13.115
You messed up.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
Look for some flashlights.

58:34.389 --> 58:37.556
This cool.

58:39.213 --> 58:40.782
Guys.

58:40.784 --> 58:41.617
Come on.

58:47.092 --> 58:48.063
Do we gotta chase them?

58:48.065 --> 58:49.232
Yeah, we do.

58:51.124 --> 58:52.394
Do we?

58:52.396 --> 58:53.571
Yes.

58:53.573 --> 58:54.406
Let's go.

58:57.964 --> 58:59.994
This is fun and all but
when we gon' get high?

58:59.996 --> 59:01.663
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

59:30.831 --> 59:33.026
Shut up.

59:33.028 --> 59:33.861
Come on.

59:46.944 --> 59:48.735
In here, in here.

59:48.737 --> 59:49.737
Get in here.

59:52.790 --> 59:53.621
This way.

59:53.623 --> 59:54.623
Go that way.

01:00:22.588 --> 01:00:26.316
Wait, there they are.

01:00:29.368 --> 01:00:30.199
There you are, little man.

01:00:30.201 --> 01:00:31.034
Come on.

01:00:32.025 --> 01:00:34.025
No, no, no, no.

01:00:35.073 --> 01:00:36.079
Please, please.

01:00:36.081 --> 01:00:36.914
No, no.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.382
No.

01:00:40.384 --> 01:00:41.884
Come on.

01:00:43.979 --> 01:00:44.810
Please, please.

01:00:44.812 --> 01:00:45.645
Don't.

01:00:47.838 --> 01:00:49.421
Grab him.

01:01:02.496 --> 01:01:03.327
Where'd he go?

01:01:03.329 --> 01:01:04.160
I know where he at.

01:01:04.162 --> 01:01:05.079
He up here.

01:01:59.951 --> 01:02:01.737
I think he's up here.

01:02:01.739 --> 01:02:02.572
Really do.

01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:17.794
Whoa, check that out, man.

01:03:17.796 --> 01:03:18.669
Check it out.

01:03:18.671 --> 01:03:19.552
Look at that.

01:03:19.554 --> 01:03:20.768
Looks like your mother.

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:22.865
That thing's prettier.

01:03:22.867 --> 01:03:24.367
Shut up.

01:03:28.027 --> 01:03:29.236
Come on, keep looking for him.

01:03:29.238 --> 01:03:30.952
He's around here somewhere.

01:03:30.954 --> 01:03:32.037
Keep looking.

01:03:56.692 --> 01:03:58.357
We don't have time for that.

01:03:58.359 --> 01:03:59.192
Come on.

01:04:21.347 --> 01:04:22.922
Oh this is lit.

01:04:22.924 --> 01:04:24.298
This is lit.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:25.508
Look at this fun house.

01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:28.677
Yo, it's a unicorn station.

01:04:29.578 --> 01:04:31.029
You know they real right?

01:04:31.031 --> 01:04:33.201
Yeah, so is prison, idiot.

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:35.275
Come on, what are we doing in here?

01:04:35.277 --> 01:04:36.141
Relax, bro.

01:04:36.143 --> 01:04:37.569
Relax.

01:04:37.571 --> 01:04:38.578
You wanna hit the pipe?

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.411
Yeah.

01:04:39.413 --> 01:04:41.156
Guys, we don't even have
time for that all right.

01:04:41.158 --> 01:04:43.569
Come on, think of a plan.

01:04:43.571 --> 01:04:46.583
You think he rode off into the sunset?

01:04:46.585 --> 01:04:47.806
It's pitch black, moron.

01:04:47.808 --> 01:04:49.725
How's he gonna do that?

01:04:52.727 --> 01:04:54.108
What are you doing?

01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:56.120
Seriously focus all right.

01:04:56.122 --> 01:04:57.065
I'm focused.

01:04:57.067 --> 01:04:57.898
I'm focused.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:58.983
You're not.

01:05:00.239 --> 01:05:03.400
Let's just get high here.

01:05:03.402 --> 01:05:04.830
We don't have time to get high.

01:05:04.832 --> 01:05:05.968
Think of a plan.

01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:07.241
Seriously.

01:05:07.243 --> 01:05:08.660
Let's get high.

01:05:09.882 --> 01:05:14.212
Do you think he's dumb
enough to go back to the house?

01:05:14.214 --> 01:05:15.297
Yeah maybe.

01:05:16.506 --> 01:05:17.813
Yeah hey.

01:05:17.815 --> 01:05:19.732
When we go back, we're gonna
look in the house for him.

01:05:19.734 --> 01:05:21.197
If we find him, we take care of him.

01:05:21.199 --> 01:05:24.760
If not, grab some stuff and
then we're gonna head out.

01:05:24.762 --> 01:05:25.593
All right?

01:05:25.595 --> 01:05:26.426
Sounds good.

01:05:26.428 --> 01:05:28.912
I bet mom's got some good food in there.

01:05:28.914 --> 01:05:30.428
We already got a piece of that.

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:31.444
You know what I'm saying?

01:05:31.446 --> 01:05:32.284
Jewelry.

01:05:32.286 --> 01:05:33.364
Jewelry, idiot.

01:05:33.366 --> 01:05:34.723
You know diamonds a girl's best friend.

01:05:34.725 --> 01:05:36.475
Seriously let's go.

01:07:04.382 --> 01:07:05.856
I don't know about this.

01:07:05.858 --> 01:07:07.941
I don't know where he is.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.099
Hey.

01:07:47.101 --> 01:07:48.515
Who you calling, little buddy?

01:08:15.792 --> 01:08:17.212
He got away.

01:08:17.214 --> 01:08:18.622
You let him get away?

01:08:18.624 --> 01:08:19.837
He's faster than he looks.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:20.671
Really?

01:08:20.673 --> 01:08:22.654
Man, now I'm really
getting pissed off.

01:08:22.656 --> 01:08:24.841
We're all pissed off all right.

01:08:24.843 --> 01:08:26.457
Let's go.

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:28.126
Seriously
why are we still here?

01:08:28.127 --> 01:08:29.170
Right.

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:30.381
We killed
those people all right.

01:08:30.384 --> 01:08:31.702
We gotta finish this.

01:08:31.703 --> 01:08:32.535
We?

01:08:32.537 --> 01:08:33.368
You must be jacked.

01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:34.662
I ain't kill anybody.

01:08:34.663 --> 01:08:36.413
This dude's tweaking.

01:09:23.502 --> 01:09:26.091
This is not fun anymore.

01:09:26.094 --> 01:09:28.353
This adventure
is blowing me, bro.

01:09:28.354 --> 01:09:29.185
Suck it up.

01:09:29.188 --> 01:09:30.783
Let's go.

01:09:30.786 --> 01:09:32.044
Can you carry me?

01:09:32.046 --> 01:09:33.546
Come on.

01:09:41.453 --> 01:09:43.060
You go on without me.

01:09:43.062 --> 01:09:43.895
Go.

01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:45.691
You don't need me.

01:09:45.693 --> 01:09:46.599
Knock it off.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.434
Let's go.

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:01.497
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:10:01.499 --> 01:10:02.330
Slow down, homie.

01:10:02.332 --> 01:10:03.163
Slow down.

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:03.996
They're coming.

01:10:03.998 --> 01:10:04.829
Hold on.

01:10:04.831 --> 01:10:05.662
Who's coming?

01:10:05.664 --> 01:10:06.495
Those guys chasing me.

01:10:06.497 --> 01:10:07.328
They killed Matt.

01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:08.161
What guys are chasing you?

01:10:08.163 --> 01:10:08.994
Wait a minute.

01:10:08.996 --> 01:10:09.827
What, what?

01:10:09.829 --> 01:10:10.660
Those guys there.

01:10:10.662 --> 01:10:12.570
They killed my parents
and they killed Matt.

01:10:12.572 --> 01:10:13.570
Hey, stand here.

01:10:13.572 --> 01:10:15.132
Don't move no matter what.

01:10:15.134 --> 01:10:16.301
Let's do this.

01:10:24.522 --> 01:10:25.355
Matt.

01:10:29.563 --> 01:10:31.529
Ayo, there he is.

01:10:31.531 --> 01:10:33.201
What you got tired of running?

01:10:33.203 --> 01:10:35.345
I say we kill him now then
head back to the house.

01:10:35.347 --> 01:10:36.178
No, no.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:37.011
There's something wrong here.

01:10:37.013 --> 01:10:37.844
What we got here?

01:10:37.846 --> 01:10:38.677
Oh shit.

01:10:38.679 --> 01:10:42.113
Looks like we got a bunch of pussies.

01:10:42.115 --> 01:10:43.228
You said they killed my brother?

01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:45.081
Yeah, they killed
him in the chicken coup.

01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:46.489
Which one of
you killed my brother?

01:10:46.491 --> 01:10:47.322
All three of them.

01:10:47.324 --> 01:10:48.937
They beat him to death.

01:10:48.939 --> 01:10:50.593
Where'd you say he was?

01:10:50.595 --> 01:10:51.969
In the chicken coup.

01:10:51.971 --> 01:10:55.138
And you just left him there?

01:10:57.905 --> 01:10:59.742
Get these motherfuckers.

01:10:59.744 --> 01:11:01.062
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:11:01.064 --> 01:11:03.135
You guys play for the wrestling team.

01:11:03.137 --> 01:11:04.142
Damn man.

01:11:04.144 --> 01:11:06.302
Now why would you upstanding gentlemen

01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:07.821
do something like this?

01:11:07.823 --> 01:11:08.654
Come on, man.

01:11:08.656 --> 01:11:10.694
They broke into the kid's
crib to get more dope.

01:11:10.696 --> 01:11:12.209
That's what they do.

01:11:12.211 --> 01:11:13.854
Something must've went wrong.

01:11:13.856 --> 01:11:15.358
Tweakers.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.055
Y'all like hurting families, huh?

01:11:17.057 --> 01:11:19.031
You know what they do to
guys like you in prison?

01:11:19.033 --> 01:11:21.174
I was just trying to get high.

01:11:21.176 --> 01:11:22.406
Yo man, I say
we save them some time

01:11:22.408 --> 01:11:23.966
and kill these fools now.

01:11:23.968 --> 01:11:24.998
Hell yeah.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.156
Ayo chill, y'all.

01:11:26.158 --> 01:11:27.404
Chill nothing.

01:11:27.406 --> 01:11:31.123
These fools killed Eddie's brother, man.

01:11:31.125 --> 01:11:31.956
They're tweakers.

01:11:31.958 --> 01:11:34.339
They're less than nothing.

01:11:34.341 --> 01:11:36.723
They don't even exist.

01:11:36.725 --> 01:11:38.331
They killed Eddie's brother.

01:11:38.333 --> 01:11:40.419
That's like pulling a
hit out on one of us.

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:42.843
Yeah but this ain't the same.

01:11:42.845 --> 01:11:45.259
Man, don't get soft on me.

01:11:45.261 --> 01:11:47.355
You don't wanna roll with
your boys then bounce.

01:11:47.357 --> 01:11:49.555
Yo, let's just do this right now.

01:11:49.557 --> 01:11:50.708
Yo you know what?

01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:52.237
I don't think we should get involved.

01:11:52.239 --> 01:11:54.219
Maybe we should just call the cops.

01:11:54.221 --> 01:11:56.771
Yeah, what was the number again?

01:11:56.773 --> 01:11:58.443
911, homie.

01:11:58.445 --> 01:12:00.539
Yeah, I got 'em on speed dial.

01:12:00.541 --> 01:12:02.659
I say we take matters
into our own hands.

01:12:02.661 --> 01:12:04.003
Yes, let's do this, homie.

01:12:04.005 --> 01:12:04.838
I'm down.

01:12:52.977 --> 01:12:54.227
I'm so sorry.

01:13:01.855 --> 01:13:04.022
We were supposed to leave.

01:13:05.103 --> 01:13:07.270
We were supposed to leave.

01:13:10.024 --> 01:13:12.191
We were supposed to leave.

01:13:14.941 --> 01:13:15.774
Get up.

01:13:17.717 --> 01:13:18.550
Get up.

01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:37.107
It wasn't supposed to be like this,

01:13:44.314 --> 01:13:46.981
but I know how to make it right.

01:14:01.355 --> 01:14:02.188
Eddie.

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:05.081
You leave my brother in the coup, huh?

01:14:05.083 --> 01:14:06.045
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

01:14:06.047 --> 01:14:07.464
Get him, Eddie.

01:14:10.078 --> 01:14:12.828
Killed my homie's brother, huh?

01:14:13.794 --> 01:14:15.303
What now huh?

01:14:18.752 --> 01:14:21.252
Dude, I'm out of here.

01:14:22.373 --> 01:14:24.316
What are we gonna do about him?

01:14:24.318 --> 01:14:27.787
Yeah, he's gonna be a problem.

01:14:27.789 --> 01:14:30.043
You ain't gonna say
anything are you little man?

01:14:30.045 --> 01:14:31.123
Yeah big problem.

01:14:31.125 --> 01:14:32.507
No, no, no.

01:14:32.509 --> 01:14:33.669
Little problem.

01:14:33.671 --> 01:14:35.308
Yeah, you just
saw us kill three guys.

01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:37.636
Man look, leave him alone, bruh.

01:14:37.638 --> 01:14:39.932
He's not gonna say anything.

01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:42.661
They just killed his parents.

01:14:42.663 --> 01:14:43.756
Little man you gonna snitch?

01:14:43.758 --> 01:14:44.812
You didn't hear me the first time?

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:45.726
I said leave him alone.

01:14:45.728 --> 01:14:46.797
He's just a kid.

01:14:46.799 --> 01:14:47.846
Yo, he's like 13.

01:14:47.848 --> 01:14:49.798
My brother's been killing
people since he was 12, dog.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.620
Look, I ain't talking
about your messed up family.

01:14:51.622 --> 01:14:52.900
I'm talking about mine.

01:14:52.902 --> 01:14:53.733
Oh all right then.

01:14:53.735 --> 01:14:55.485
We gonna let boss man get us pinched.

01:14:55.487 --> 01:14:57.300
Sell us out like that old man.

01:14:57.302 --> 01:14:58.980
You wanna see your crew go to jail?

01:14:58.982 --> 01:15:02.119
Rot in the cell while your
dope sits on the shelf.

01:15:02.121 --> 01:15:03.108
It's probably the same dope that got

01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:04.622
these tweakers messed up
and killed your brother.

01:15:04.624 --> 01:15:07.406
So in a roundabout way,
this all your fault.

01:15:07.408 --> 01:15:08.332
Man, what you say to me?

01:15:08.334 --> 01:15:09.580
Yo, yo, yo, chill homie.

01:15:09.582 --> 01:15:11.412
That fool is tripping.

01:15:11.414 --> 01:15:14.116
Look, I'm not gonna say it no more.

01:15:14.118 --> 01:15:16.029
Leave him alone.

01:15:22.296 --> 01:15:23.852
No, I promise
I won't say anything.

01:15:23.854 --> 01:15:25.468
You sure you're
not gonna say nothing?

01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:27.053
I promise.

01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:29.332
Man, why did you do that?

01:15:29.334 --> 01:15:31.492
There was other ways of keeping him quiet.

01:15:31.494 --> 01:15:33.124
I just did that.

01:15:33.126 --> 01:15:34.534
Man, this ain't us, man.

01:15:34.536 --> 01:15:35.572
That was my brother's homeboy.

01:15:35.574 --> 01:15:36.764
He had his back.

01:15:36.766 --> 01:15:38.308
Apparently not.

01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:39.980
Now all I see is a witness.

01:15:39.982 --> 01:15:41.581
Yeah dog, I ain't going back to jail.

01:15:41.583 --> 01:15:43.332
Look, ain't nobody going back to jail,

01:15:43.334 --> 01:15:45.348
but he don't deserve this either.

01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:49.908
So what y'all trying to
prove by killing a kid?

01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:53.077
My man grew a heart all of a sudden.

01:15:54.705 --> 01:15:56.222
Man what happened to you?

01:15:56.224 --> 01:15:57.913
They just killed his parents, dog.

01:15:57.915 --> 01:16:00.513
Yeah, and it's gonna look all connected.

01:16:00.515 --> 01:16:02.159
He had nothing to do with it.

01:16:02.161 --> 01:16:03.319
He's innocent.

01:16:03.321 --> 01:16:04.726
He had everything to do with it

01:16:04.728 --> 01:16:07.655
the second he saw us get
down on these tweakers.

01:16:07.657 --> 01:16:09.527
Ain't nobody innocent.

01:16:09.529 --> 01:16:11.959
Yeah, I've seen
gangsters walk to the cops.

01:16:11.961 --> 01:16:13.559
Opie is gonna talk.

01:16:13.561 --> 01:16:14.392
No doubt.

01:16:14.394 --> 01:16:16.207
Look man, there's other ways, man.

01:16:16.209 --> 01:16:17.440
We could've moved him out of town.

01:16:17.442 --> 01:16:18.591
Paid him off.

01:16:18.593 --> 01:16:19.927
Safe house.

01:16:19.929 --> 01:16:21.519
Man, at this point he's better off.

01:16:21.521 --> 01:16:24.225
It's not like he's got a family anymore.

01:16:24.227 --> 01:16:25.825
Too soon?

01:16:25.827 --> 01:16:26.993
Chill dog.

01:16:26.995 --> 01:16:29.111
Just walk it off.

01:16:29.113 --> 01:16:30.145
Oh how cute.

01:16:30.147 --> 01:16:31.363
Boys for life.

01:16:31.365 --> 01:16:32.947
Yeah, turn your back on your real homies.

01:16:32.949 --> 01:16:35.735
The ones that made you rich.

01:16:35.737 --> 01:16:37.441
Nah man I'm good.

01:16:37.443 --> 01:16:38.751
Let's just get the tweakers in the car

01:16:38.753 --> 01:16:40.551
and get the hell out of here.

01:16:40.553 --> 01:16:45.129
Eddie, you know he's gonna
sing the second he wakes up.

01:16:45.131 --> 01:16:46.737
Look, you're out.

01:16:46.739 --> 01:16:47.656
We're done.

01:16:50.059 --> 01:16:51.392
Whatever boss.

01:17:00.224 --> 01:17:01.641
No, no, no, no.

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.349
Man, what's wrong with you, man?

01:17:05.351 --> 01:17:06.693
Chill, chill, chill, chill, dog.

01:17:06.695 --> 01:17:08.541
Man, I guess I'm out then.

01:17:08.543 --> 01:17:10.893
So this our reputation now?

01:17:10.895 --> 01:17:12.775
Man, the kid was gonna snitch, man.

01:17:12.777 --> 01:17:14.565
I just did us a huge favor.

01:17:14.567 --> 01:17:15.645
Yeah, you're welcome, lady.

01:17:15.647 --> 01:17:17.021
Look man, I can't believe this, man.

01:17:17.023 --> 01:17:18.821
Look my man, nobody
needs to know we were here.

01:17:18.823 --> 01:17:20.621
Let's just get out of here.

01:17:20.623 --> 01:17:21.885
What is with you two?

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:23.414
This is what some kind of bromance?

01:17:23.416 --> 01:17:25.238
Look man, let's just figure it out, man.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.757
You two put him in the trunk.

01:17:43.716 --> 01:17:45.314
Really?

01:17:45.316 --> 01:17:46.716
They ain't gonna fit in here.

01:17:46.718 --> 01:17:48.412
You got any better ideas?

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:50.420
Nah I'm just saying you
got all this junk back here.

01:17:50.422 --> 01:17:51.581
All right then.

01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:53.267
They'll just have to sit on your lap.

01:17:53.269 --> 01:17:56.067
Yeah, I think that
might be the only way.

01:17:56.069 --> 01:17:57.115
Dang.

01:17:57.117 --> 01:18:00.179
Dead fiends ain't sitting on my lap.

01:18:00.181 --> 01:18:01.236
Man, suck it up.

01:18:01.238 --> 01:18:02.771
It ain't even over yet.

01:18:02.773 --> 01:18:03.979
You guys just get 'em in the car.

01:18:03.981 --> 01:18:04.814
Let's go.

01:18:10.253 --> 01:18:11.667
So what now?

01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:13.380
What do you think, fool?

01:18:13.382 --> 01:18:14.259
Dig some holes.

01:18:14.261 --> 01:18:15.771
What you ain't never dug a hole?

01:18:15.773 --> 01:18:17.741
Man, I hate digging.

01:18:17.743 --> 01:18:19.109
You prefer jail?

01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:20.979
We'll be at it all night.

01:18:20.981 --> 01:18:22.115
And you're already complaining.

01:18:22.117 --> 01:18:24.667
I'm just saying.

01:18:24.669 --> 01:18:27.597
Yo Eddie, you all right?

01:18:27.599 --> 01:18:31.099
I'm just ready for
this night to be over with.

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.906
Hey the car's getting away.

01:18:37.908 --> 01:18:39.682
Do you even know who those people were?

01:18:39.684 --> 01:18:40.962
No, I don't.

01:18:40.964 --> 01:18:42.466
Do you know what
they're gonna do with the body?

01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:44.772
Maybe they're gonna dig a hole

01:18:44.774 --> 01:18:46.602
and put the body in the hole.

01:18:46.604 --> 01:18:47.570
They might.

01:18:47.572 --> 01:18:49.820
They may come back here and hide the body.

01:18:49.822 --> 01:18:52.226
This is a really good
place to hide bodies.

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:54.450
I wonder if they saw us hiding.

01:18:54.452 --> 01:18:56.610
Probably not.

01:18:56.612 --> 01:18:57.443
That was crazy.

01:18:57.445 --> 01:18:58.908
There was blood everywhere.

01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:01.915
Dude, it was
squirting everywhere.

01:19:01.917 --> 01:19:03.505
I got the whole thing on video.

01:19:03.507 --> 01:19:05.027
So did I.

01:19:05.029 --> 01:19:06.674
Should we tell mom and dad?

01:19:06.676 --> 01:19:07.522
No, no, no.

01:19:07.524 --> 01:19:08.650
We'll probably get in trouble

01:19:08.652 --> 01:19:11.242
for being out without them knowing.

01:19:11.244 --> 01:19:12.954
Should we call the cops?

01:19:12.956 --> 01:19:14.242
Probably.

01:19:14.244 --> 01:19:15.978
But first let's post it on YouTube.

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.194
Yeah, we'll have lots of likes.

01:19:18.196 --> 01:19:20.010
Yeah, we'll be famous.

01:19:20.012 --> 01:19:21.578
Yeah and popular at school.

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.411
Yeah.

01:19:22.413 --> 01:19:23.244
Yeah.

01:19:23.246 --> 01:19:24.663
Awesome.

01:19:36.546 --> 01:19:37.848
