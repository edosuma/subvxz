[clattering]

00:19.102 --> 00:20.520
[grunt of effort]

00:21.563 --> 00:22.939
[Barb] Bubbles!

00:23.398 --> 00:24.691
Can I have a word, please?

00:24.774 --> 00:26.109
Sure, Barb, what's going on?

00:26.192 --> 00:28.153
What do you think
I have in my hands here?

00:28.236 --> 00:31.656
Well, I would say that is a piece
of papier, as the French would say.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.742
Very good. It is indeed
a piece of papier.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.453
And what do you think
is on this piece of papier?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.831
Well, by the way you're gritting
your old steak chewers there,

00:39.914 --> 00:41.583
I'm guessing it's not good. Is it?

00:41.666 --> 00:43.877
This is a quote
from a pest control company

00:43.960 --> 00:46.463
to get rid of the rats
in the park, Bubbles.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.673
Holy fuck! What are they doing,

00:48.757 --> 00:50.925
dipping the cocksuckers
in liquid gold to get rid of them?

00:51.009 --> 00:53.178
Bubbles, I'm sorry,
but you have got two choices.

00:53.261 --> 00:57.057
You can either pay that or you can
shut down this operation. No, I...

00:57.140 --> 00:58.433
-What?
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:58.516 --> 01:00.727
But this is...
this is out of control!

01:00.810 --> 01:03.354
As the French would say,
trop, c'est trop.

01:03.688 --> 01:04.980
I don't know what that means!

01:05.065 --> 01:07.025
Ugh. It means enough is enough!

01:07.108 --> 01:08.610
Barb, this isn't really fair.

01:08.693 --> 01:11.446
I mean, I told you, once the bottles
leave my property,

01:11.529 --> 01:13.281
how is that my responsibility?

01:13.364 --> 01:15.200
-Bubbles...
-No, I'm serious! I mean...

01:15.283 --> 01:18.369
are you gonna tell the Burger Shack
they've got to start paying to clean up

01:18.453 --> 01:22.123
all the cheeseburger wrappers and
semi-ingested fucking onion ring fragments

01:22.207 --> 01:23.833
-that Randy blows all over the path?
-Bubbles!

01:23.917 --> 01:26.377
That is not the same thing at all!

01:26.461 --> 01:28.296
I believe that it is, Barb.
This is bullshit!

01:28.379 --> 01:30.423
[Ricky] Hey, Bubs, what's going on?
What the fuck's happening?

01:30.507 --> 01:33.092
-Why you getting upset?
-He's getting upset because of this.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.762
This is the... contract
for the rat control in the park

01:35.845 --> 01:38.431
and Bubbles needs to pay it
or shut down this operation.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.350
-[whimpering]
-This is fucking insane!

01:40.433 --> 01:43.520
Get rid of rats? I can get rid
of the little fuckers for half of this.

01:43.603 --> 01:44.437
[laughing]

01:44.521 --> 01:46.648
You think you can deal
with pest control for the park?

01:46.731 --> 01:49.234
Fuck yeah. For a joke. The old man
was the master at dealing with rats.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.860
Fucking knew every trick of the book.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.446
Oh, okay, all right.
If you, uh, if you can prove to me

01:53.530 --> 01:54.739
that you are capable of this,

01:54.823 --> 01:57.534
I will give you the contract
for all of Sunnyvale

01:57.617 --> 02:00.328
for half of half of this.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.498
Fucking done. Are you kidding me?
I would've did it for half, Barb.

02:03.581 --> 02:05.250
-Well, Ricky...
-Thank you, Barb.

02:05.333 --> 02:06.835
-No problem.
-Thanks a lot.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.044
Ricky, that...

02:09.753 --> 02:10.964
[sigh]

02:11.256 --> 02:14.384
-What?
-You just made a fucking terrible deal.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.686
-Yeah, hey, Ricky... Ricky!
-What?

03:06.769 --> 03:08.938
-What are you doing?
-Need to borrow the truck.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.400
No, no, Ricky, Ricky, I can't loan you
the fucking truck. I've gotta use it.

03:12.483 --> 03:15.361
What? Look, I only took the job from Barb
to help you out, man.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.406
Well, Ricky, that's not really
fucking fair to say.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.742
How are you gonna do that job
that cheap anyway?

03:20.825 --> 03:23.620
I can easily do it for fucking half
of what they were talking about.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.747
Ricky, you said you'd do it
for a quarter.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.123
[laughing] A quarter?

03:27.206 --> 03:30.335
I would never fucking do it for a quarter.
She said half of a half.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.711
Come on, I'm doing this for you.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.963
It's pretty fucked you're not gonna
lend me the truck.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.132
[sighing]
Ricky... for fuck's sakes.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.135
Just need it a couple hours,
pick up the shit I need for the job.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.303
Come on, buddy.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.971
[annoyed growl]

03:42.347 --> 03:43.514
All right.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.808
All right, but I need it back
this afternoon.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.101
I've got deliveries to make.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.853
-Hey, Bubs...
-No problem.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.814
-I need to use your truck, man.
-What do I look like,

03:51.898 --> 03:54.442
the fucking I'm-giving-out-free-trucks-
to-everybody guy?

03:54.525 --> 03:56.778
What? Come on, this is important.

03:56.861 --> 03:59.155
Yeah, well, what I do
is important too, Julian.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.407
-Yeah?
-I couldn't loan it to you if I wanted to,

04:01.491 --> 04:03.117
because apparently
I just loaned it to Ricky.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.953
-That's right, buddy.
-How long you gonna be, man?

04:05.036 --> 04:08.039
-I'll get it off you when you're done.
-No problem. I shouldn't be too long.

04:08.122 --> 04:09.165
-Cool. Right on.
-[snapping fingers]

04:09.249 --> 04:10.416
-Excuse me!
-What?

04:10.500 --> 04:13.544
Do you see me standing here?
I'm in charge of my fucking truck.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.797
I will decide who gets
to use it and when.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.382
Well, not anymore.
Now I'm in charge,

04:17.464 --> 04:19.007
'cause you loaned it to me, right?

04:19.300 --> 04:20.593
-What?
-Isn't that the rule?

04:20.677 --> 04:23.221
You loan something to somebody,
they're in charge until they give it back.

04:23.304 --> 04:25.056
-Pretty sure...
-Yeah, no, that's...

04:25.139 --> 04:26.432
-You're right, Ricky.
-I thought I was.

04:26.516 --> 04:29.435
I forgot that was on the front page
of the fucking book of etiquette.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.646
So you're in charge
of my truck, not me,

04:31.729 --> 04:33.940
so give it to whoever
the fuck you want, Ricky.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.401
-Perfect, man. Bubs...
-[Bubbles] No, no!

04:36.484 --> 04:38.778
Holy fuck, somebody woke up
on the left side of the bed.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.364
-Right on. Talk to you in a bit.
-See you in a bit.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.079
I'm telling you, Randy,
it's a sure thing.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.331
[slurring]
Look, just bet on him already!

04:50.415 --> 04:53.334
Look, you're gonna have another $100
to bet with tomorrow.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.461
And there'll be other sure things,
I'm sure. I'm hungry

04:55.545 --> 04:58.756
and I'm gonna get something to eat
and see how much I have left over.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.550
Oh, Randy...

05:00.633 --> 05:02.051
-Hello.
-Hi.

05:02.510 --> 05:05.221
Could I get a extra-large order
of onion rings...

05:05.305 --> 05:08.266
-[cash register whirring]
-...a cheeseburger with two extra patties

05:08.349 --> 05:10.518
and six slices of cheese...

05:11.602 --> 05:14.522
two hot-dogs with cheese and bacon,

05:14.772 --> 05:17.233
and a large popcorn with layered butter.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.277
And can you do four layers on that?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.738
-[cash register whirring]
-Extra-large rings;

05:21.821 --> 05:26.367
cheeseburger, two ex-pats, six slices;
two dogs, add cheese, bacon;

05:26.451 --> 05:28.661
large popcorn, four layers.
Is that everything?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.955
Uh, could you, uh,
poutine-up the rings?

05:31.039 --> 05:35.001
And give me two large beer
and two ice cream sandwiches.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.419
You want anything, Mr. Lahey?

05:36.502 --> 05:37.754
No, I'm good.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.005
Okay, that's everything.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.673
$49.25.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.093
There's 50.
Keep the change.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.096
Randy, come on, let's go place a bet
while they're cooking that shit up.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.056
-No, Mr. Lahey.
-What?

05:48.139 --> 05:51.517
You know what? It's not my fault
you lost all your money in 10 minutes.

05:51.601 --> 05:55.688
I'm in charge of my own money
and I decide who I'm betting on and when.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.399
Randy, look, I get $100 allowance, right?

05:58.483 --> 06:00.943
-Yeah.
-Okay. You can keep my tomorrow's $100

06:01.027 --> 06:03.613
if you give me $50 now.
I got a sure fucking thing, Randy.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.239
You wanna bet your tomorrow money?

06:05.323 --> 06:07.742
Yeah, of course. Look, Randy...
I'll tell you what.

06:07.825 --> 06:12.455
If I lose, you get tomorrow's 100,
and if I win, I'll split half with you.

06:13.706 --> 06:14.791
You can't lose, bud.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.668
Let me have some food
and I'll think about it, Mr. Lahey.

06:17.752 --> 06:21.464
Oh, Randy!
For fuck's sakes!

06:23.633 --> 06:25.093
Hey, boys, what's up?

06:25.176 --> 06:27.136
Hey, Mr. Finch.
What's up, man?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.846
-Rascal, what's going on, man?
-What's up, man?

06:28.930 --> 06:30.807
-T. Mr. Green.
-Hi, buddy.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.392
I need you to steal some shit
for me down at the mall.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.104
When you say steal some shit,
define "steal some shit."

06:36.562 --> 06:38.815
Just got to take some furniture,
bring it back to my trailer.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.358
-That's it, man. It's easy.
-No way.

06:40.441 --> 06:41.943
Not after what happened
the other day.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.945
Ricky almost shot at us for real, man.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.780
And we didn't get paid
for that fucking thing.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.824
Okay, well, now you will.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.493
-What you got?
-I confiscated this down at the mall, man.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.538
It's yours. Plus 100 bucks cash
as soon as the job's done.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.500
Well man, we can... we can pick it up,
but we ain't stealing it.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.544
-[Julian sighing]
-We ain't stealing it, man.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.338
All right. Okay. I guess I could get
somebody else to steal it,

07:02.421 --> 07:05.174
but you've gotta be there
at 2:00 sharp or I'm fucked.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.801
-That's when the shift changes.
-2:00.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.595
-Can do 2:00. I got you.
-You gonna be there for me?

07:09.679 --> 07:10.930
-We got you, bro.
-All right.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.265
-Thanks, boys.
-[mixed chatter]

07:12.348 --> 07:13.975
[Tyrone] We all split it, yeah?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.311
Great job, everybody.
We're getting there.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.688
[girl] This is so gross.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.941
What the fuck does this
have to do with hockey?

07:22.608 --> 07:25.278
Actually this has everything to do
with hockey, okay?

07:25.361 --> 07:27.363
This is about the...
the business side of things,

07:27.447 --> 07:29.073
and managing your money,
that sort of shit.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.284
Do you know how many professional
hockey players go bankrupt?

07:31.367 --> 07:34.579
-Do you?
-No. Do you? I doubt it.

07:34.662 --> 07:38.291
Actually I do, you little snot,
but I was asking you guys if you knew.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.210
All right, I'm done shovelling this stuff
for $1 an hour.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.129
Yeah, fuck this. This is bullshit.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.300
Actually, it's not bullshit,
it's cow shit there, dickhead.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.344
This is how it's gonna be, is it?
Let me tell you this.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.013
We're not leaving here
till that is full.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.891
If the farmer that owns this place
comes back and catches us doing this,

07:54.974 --> 07:57.059
he's gonna shoot at us.
He already shot me twice.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.895
Are you serious?
We could get shot?

07:58.978 --> 08:00.688
-That's crazy!
-[Ricky] Yeah, it is crazy.

08:00.771 --> 08:03.691
So let's get this done fast
so we can get the fuck out of here!

08:04.525 --> 08:07.612
I'm scared.
I do not wanna get shot.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.614
Okay, listen.
I didn't mean that.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.574
No one's gonna get shot.
I was kind of joking.

08:11.657 --> 08:12.950
If he does come back, we're fine.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.285
-[gun clicking]
-I've got this.

08:14.368 --> 08:15.953
Oh, my God.
Is that a real gun?

08:16.037 --> 08:18.206
Yeah, but it's just to protect us.
Don't freak out.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.374
[girl] Okay, let's pick up the pace, team.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.043
-Great idea.
-Yeah, let's do this.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.921
-Oh, for fuck's sakes.
-Quit your whining.

08:25.004 --> 08:28.799
Get that little mini-shovel and get
as much dirt in there as you fucking can!

08:30.301 --> 08:32.094
I don't know. This is a tough call.
I mean...

08:32.178 --> 08:34.138
What's the story on this lamp?
This is really nice.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.140
Yeah, well, it's my favourite.
I actually have one in my office.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.936
-Oh, no way.
-If you'd like to see it in a more...

08:40.477 --> 08:43.397
-intimate setting.
-Hmm... I...

08:43.481 --> 08:46.108
This is tough though, 'cause I like
this one as well. Like...

08:46.192 --> 08:48.819
this one's got a...
like, a thinner base.

08:48.903 --> 08:52.198
-This is a bigger base.
-I actually would like to show you...

08:52.281 --> 08:54.951
No, no, I... This is the one here
or this is the one.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.869
I mean, I've gotta pick one of these.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.206
They're both pretty
expensive though, right?

09:00.706 --> 09:02.875
Well, you get what you pay for...

09:02.959 --> 09:04.585
[chuckling] ...as they say.

09:04.794 --> 09:08.714
I mean, you know, we could maybe
discuss the uh...

09:09.382 --> 09:12.510
possibility of a discount arrangement,
if you're interested.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.178
[Julian] Copy that.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.931
[sighing]
Let me see. Since I'm a guy,

09:17.014 --> 09:18.975
you know, I'm horrible at this stuff.

09:19.058 --> 09:22.103
I don't know.
Big base? Little base?

09:22.186 --> 09:23.354
Big base?
Little base?

09:23.437 --> 09:25.147
I always go for a bigger base.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.607
-Mm-hmm.
-Is the room quite small?

09:26.691 --> 09:29.694
Sometimes a small base is... better...

09:29.777 --> 09:31.153
Okay, you know what?
I can't decide.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.489
This is isn't gonna happen today.
I'm sorry. I apologize.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.700
I'm gonna go check your locks
and stuff out back.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.286
Maybe we'll discuss this some other time.
All right? Thank you.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.996
You know what?
You're hot.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.415
Just had to say that,
get that out there.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.958
All right. Talk to you.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.003
If you need me, I've got a walkie
right here. Call me anytime.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.546
Okay.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.382
[Cory and Jacob arguing]

09:51.632 --> 09:52.883
What the fuck...

09:52.967 --> 09:54.677
What are you fucking boneheads doing?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.887
-I don't know, man...
-How did you manage this?

09:56.971 --> 09:58.556
You guys are fucking dumb,
you know that?

09:58.639 --> 10:00.725
-You're fucking dumb!
-Oh, fuck...

10:00.808 --> 10:02.476
-Jeez, turn around!
-[Jacob] Ahh!

10:02.560 --> 10:04.228
Jesus Christ.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.480
What the fuck is that still doing here?

10:06.564 --> 10:08.357
Well, dude, with the tangling
and the screaming

10:08.441 --> 10:10.985
and everything else going on...
And T's not even here, dude.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.487
-[annoyed sigh]
-Just say that. So, nothing is my fault.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.197
-Fuck!
-[Jacob] We could probably push it back

10:15.281 --> 10:17.700
to the trailer for you, Julian.
It might take a while though.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.869
Come on. Come on.
Answer the fucking phone.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.288
[phone ringing]

10:22.371 --> 10:25.291
[Julian] T, man, why the fuck do you guys
all have your cellphones turned off?

10:25.374 --> 10:26.459
-[laughter]
-Come on, T!

10:26.542 --> 10:28.252
I was counting on you guys.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.088
Do you know how much bullshit
this is creating for me right now?

10:31.172 --> 10:32.590
You better not be sitting around

10:32.673 --> 10:34.091
smoking that weed
I gave you guys.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.469
-That was for payment!
-[laughing harder]

10:38.137 --> 10:40.348
You guys are getting
fucked up, aren't you?

10:41.349 --> 10:42.933
Fuck's sakes, man.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.810
I want my weed back!

10:44.894 --> 10:47.104
-Thanks!
-[answering machine beeps]

10:47.480 --> 10:48.981
-[buzz saw whirring]
-Keep going, keep going...

10:49.065 --> 10:50.316
-Okay, good!
-[whirring stops]

10:50.399 --> 10:51.984
Perfect, little buddy.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.278
Holy fuck, it's hot out today.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.364
Why do you use
so many bad words?

10:56.447 --> 10:58.074
They're just words.
What makes them fucking bad?

10:58.157 --> 11:01.494
-[Brendan] Good fucking point.
-How is that not stealing?

11:01.577 --> 11:03.621
I thought the rule was
you can't steal from trailer parks.

11:03.704 --> 11:06.624
You can't steal from this trailer park.
Other trailer parks are fair game.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.668
At Crescent Heights,
they stole a bunch of our residents.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.795
It's only fair we take a bit
of their trailer security.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.588
That's not stealing,
that's called being fair.

11:12.671 --> 11:15.174
No. That's still stealing.
Have you ever been tested

11:15.257 --> 11:16.509
-for a learning disorder?
-[cellphone ringing]

11:16.592 --> 11:19.678
Have you ever been tested
for being a dick? That's enough.

11:20.763 --> 11:21.764
Hey, Julian.

11:22.556 --> 11:24.934
I can't bring it there right now, man,
I'm still using it.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.894
What kind of fucking emergency?

11:28.020 --> 11:30.815
Oh, for fuck's sakes.
All right, I'll do it for 100 bucks,

11:30.898 --> 11:33.025
but you're gonna owe me.
I'll be right there.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.236
Goddammit.
What the fuck.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.695
[Bubbles] Ricky!

11:37.238 --> 11:39.448
Ricky, what in the flying fuck did you do?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.158
-[Ricky] What'd you mean?
-Give me the keys!

11:41.242 --> 11:42.660
I can't. I'm still using it.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.620
Oh, my fuck!

11:44.703 --> 11:46.789
Ricky, my poor little truck.
You ruined it!

11:46.872 --> 11:50.292
-Ruined it? How? It's not ruined.
-It's full of poop!

11:50.376 --> 11:52.670
Okay. Did I not say this morning
I need to borrow your truck

11:52.753 --> 11:55.923
to pick up all this shit I need
for this job? Did I not say that?

11:56.006 --> 12:00.594
Well, yes, technically, Ricky.
But I didn't know you meant literal shit!

12:00.678 --> 12:04.348
Oh, my fuck! Look at my poor truck,
the poop's seeping right into the wood.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.267
-It's ruined.
-It's just a bit of cow manure.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.352
It washes off.
When you fall in a pile of shit,

12:08.436 --> 12:10.938
you have a shower, clean it up.
I'll get the kids to clean it.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.773
[Brendan] I'm not cleaning
that fucking thing.

12:12.857 --> 12:13.983
[girl] Me neither.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.569
Ricky, empty it out right now.
I'm taking it.

12:16.652 --> 12:19.780
I can't, Julian hired me for a job
and I need to use it for that.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.783
-It's my truck!
-I know, did you not also say this:

12:22.867 --> 12:24.952
I'm in charge of the truck
until I give it back?

12:25.035 --> 12:27.371
You said, "You're in charge
until you give it back." Right?

12:27.455 --> 12:30.291
I said it, but I was being sarcastic.
Okay.

12:30.374 --> 12:33.586
Since you take everything literally,
listen to my fucking words, Ricky.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.880
I want the truck back
by the end of the day,

12:35.963 --> 12:38.966
shit-free, smelling like
1,000 fucking roses.

12:39.049 --> 12:42.803
Oh, yeah, like I can afford 1,000 roses.
Okay. Jesus Christ.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.598
-[annoyed huff]
-What?

12:47.183 --> 12:48.601
All right, kids,
stop what you're doing.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.228
Pile in the back of the truck.
We've gotta go help Julian.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.231
Step on the tarp
so you don't get shit on you.

12:58.235 --> 13:00.571
Hang on tight.
We'll be going on the highway.

13:00.738 --> 13:01.697
[child] Okay.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.700
[indistinct chatter on loudspeaker]

13:05.201 --> 13:08.954
Randy, could we please just go
to the pick-up window?

13:09.038 --> 13:10.539
We already missed two races

13:10.623 --> 13:13.209
from your goddamned
un-decisiveness.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.753
I just can't decide
between Pineapple Cream,

13:15.836 --> 13:18.964
Rainbow Unicorn
or Flipsy-Flopsy, Mr. Lahey.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.926
Randy, all three of those horses
are losers.

13:22.009 --> 13:26.347
It's Muscle Beach or Gladiator Stance,
I'm telling you!

13:27.097 --> 13:29.975
Okay. Go ahead,
you can bet on those horses.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.144
Lose your tomorrow money, Mr. Lahey.
I don't care.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.604
All right, I will.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.690
Excuse me. Hi.

13:36.774 --> 13:40.653
I'd like to place a bet on
Gladiator Stance to place, pretty please.

13:40.736 --> 13:41.695
Okay.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.406
Thank you.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.660
♪ Luck be a horsey tonight ♪

13:47.743 --> 13:49.537
-♪ Luck be a pony tonight... ♪
-Hello.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.747
-Hello.
-I just can't decide between these three.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.207
They all sound so yummy.

13:53.290 --> 13:56.669
Oh. Well, you can bet on all three
of them in a trifecta, if you want,

13:56.752 --> 13:58.212
and they can finish in any order.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.756
I didn't know that.
That sounds great. I'll do it.

14:00.839 --> 14:05.010
Well, Randy, bidding
on th-three long shots...

14:05.094 --> 14:06.804
to come first, second, or third,

14:06.887 --> 14:10.140
that's the stupidest bet that anyone
can ever make in their life.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.559
Use your goddamn head, bud!

14:11.642 --> 14:14.436
Good. I like betting on the underdog,
Mr. Lahey.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.438
Why do you think I've been with you?

14:17.356 --> 14:18.482
Right.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.362
Okay, careful, girls, don't get any
shit smears on the sofa.

14:23.445 --> 14:26.073
Jesus Christ, Ricky, I told you
this stuff was gonna stink.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.033
What the fuck you talking about?
It smells fine.

14:28.117 --> 14:32.079
-It doesn't smell fine.
-Well, lookie, lookie, lookie!

14:32.162 --> 14:36.876
I notice I still don't have a bathroom,
you moronic fucking cuckoo bird.

14:36.959 --> 14:40.504
I told you, I'm waiting on supplies!
I'm fucking... it'll get done, I promise!

14:40.588 --> 14:41.881
Well, that's very good,

14:41.964 --> 14:45.676
because until that time,
I will be using your facilities.

14:45.759 --> 14:48.470
Oh, and I've got
the worst diarrhea. Ugh!

14:48.554 --> 14:50.806
You better use some spray
or light a match this time!

14:50.890 --> 14:52.850
-It's fucking disgusting.
-[car approaching]

14:53.017 --> 14:55.477
[Bubbles] Are you guys fucking joking?

14:55.561 --> 14:57.521
Are you joking right now?

14:58.188 --> 14:59.773
Unbelievable.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.735
Now, let me guess.
There's still shit in the truck.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.779
Yeah, still a big pile of shit.

15:05.863 --> 15:09.408
Shit on my fucking brake pedal,
my gas pedal, and the steering wheel.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.077
-What the fuck is wrong with you guys?
-It's fucking fine!

15:12.161 --> 15:14.413
You got a good sniffer on you.
Give that a sniff.

15:14.496 --> 15:17.833
-Tell me if it smells like shit to you.
-I don't need to give that a sniff.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.962
I'll tell you right now, unequivocally,
that, yes, it does smell like shit.

15:22.046 --> 15:25.215
And where'd you get the money
to buy all this, Julian? Let me guess.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.718
I get an employee discount
down at the mall, Bubs.

15:27.801 --> 15:30.763
You get an employee di...
At the whole fucking mall, do you?

15:30.846 --> 15:33.223
-Yeah.
-An employee discount. Unbelievable.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.601
Do you feel that in the air, boys?
Do you feel that?

15:35.684 --> 15:38.854
You know what that is?
It's disappointment!

15:38.938 --> 15:40.731
That's all I feel for you guys.

15:40.814 --> 15:42.149
-[Ricky] Why?
-Every time.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.151
Oh, fuck off, Ricky.

15:44.234 --> 15:47.863
My fuck, Ricky, there's a huge shit
smear right on my fucking armrest!

15:47.947 --> 15:49.907
-You kidding me?
-Just get a can of the breeze,

15:49.990 --> 15:53.118
-it'll fucking make that as good as new.
-How's it gonna take the stain out?

15:53.202 --> 15:55.829
It's what the breeze does. It fucking
goes in and blows it fucking...

15:55.913 --> 15:58.374
way over there somewhere.
Hey, babe!

15:58.624 --> 16:00.501
-Hey, sweetheart.
-[Brendan] Hi.

16:00.584 --> 16:04.004
Hi!
How was hockey camp today?

16:04.088 --> 16:05.297
We're not doing hockey stuff.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.758
We're helping Julian
move stolen furniture.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.510
Ricky's paying us $1 each.

16:09.593 --> 16:10.719
That's right.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.055
That's what you've been doing today?

16:13.430 --> 16:15.683
No, we were shovelling shit
under trailers earlier,

16:15.766 --> 16:17.977
-but we got paid for that too.
-That's right, buddy.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.436
-Fuckin' serious?
-What the fuck?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.480
-Huh? Really?
-Well, hold on a second!

16:21.563 --> 16:22.898
I was teaching them some other stuff.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.192
About building muscles
and money and...

16:25.275 --> 16:26.694
-Yeah?
-...different stuff like that.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.612
You are so full of shit, Ricky.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.114
You're full of shit!

16:30.197 --> 16:33.033
Get in the car, Brendan.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

16:33.117 --> 16:36.370
-All right. Stop fucking raging.
-My God, mind your fucking mouth!

16:36.453 --> 16:37.997
Does this mean you aren't
fucking staying tonight?

16:38.080 --> 16:39.999
No, I guess not, Rick.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.251
He's fucking not going anywhere.
I'm not done shovelling shit.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.795
-I need all hands on deck.
-Well, his hands are going home.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.548
Get in the car, Brendan!
Get in the car!

16:47.631 --> 16:50.676
We are so fucking done, Ricky.
We are fucking done!

16:50.759 --> 16:53.721
What? Are you fucking kidding me
right now? Go fuck yourself then.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.389
If you're gonna break up
with me again

16:55.472 --> 16:58.517
over a bit of stolen furniture
and a pile of shit that got shovelled,

16:58.600 --> 17:00.728
then go fuck yourself!
This was never true love, was it?

17:00.811 --> 17:03.897
And I'm looking for true fucking love!
So get the fuck out of here then!

17:03.981 --> 17:06.483
Well, good luck to you,
you fucking dork!

17:07.859 --> 17:09.194
For fuck's sakes.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.906
God, I'm glad she's not my mother.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.491
Jesus.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.828
Alright, grab your shovels, kids, we're
gonna have to fucking pick up the pace.

17:17.911 --> 17:20.289
You're gonna have to dig a little
deeper to make up for Brendan.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.540
Good news: I'm gonna let you split
Brendan's dollar, all right?

17:22.624 --> 17:24.042
[kids cheering]

17:25.335 --> 17:26.587
Come on, baby.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.047
Come on, baby.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.298
[Mr. Lahey] Who's that?

17:29.381 --> 17:31.550
Look! That's one of yours, Randy.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.469
Look, that's one of...
That's one...!

17:33.552 --> 17:34.511
-That's one...!
-Yes!

17:34.595 --> 17:35.929
You! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

17:36.013 --> 17:38.432
I don't believe it, Randy!
I don't fucking believe it!

17:38.515 --> 17:40.559
You won, bud!
You won! You won!

17:40.642 --> 17:43.771
What are you so excited for?
Your horse came dead last, Mr. Lahey.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.190
Well, Randy,
I don't think you understand.

17:46.273 --> 17:49.693
You picked the trifecta, bud!
We're rich!

17:50.069 --> 17:53.072
Oh, that was my money and my bets.
There's no "we're" anything.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.656
And you owe me 100 bucks
for tomorrow.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.284
Okay, sorry, Randy.
You're right, absolutely right.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.244
Congratulations, big guy.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.830
You know, something
I've never been able to say to you

18:01.914 --> 18:03.832
in all these years, Randy:

18:03.916 --> 18:05.084
you're a winner.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.044
You're my little wiener.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.378
Thanks, Mr. Lahey.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.923
I really like coming down here
and spending time with you.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.841
And they feed me like a king.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.010
If I win a little bit more money,
Mr. Lahey,

18:15.094 --> 18:17.888
I'm hiring that Assistant Assistant
Trailer Park Supervisor.

18:17.971 --> 18:22.476
Randy, what are you talking about?
You already won $2,500.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.520
-$2,500?
-Yeah!

18:24.603 --> 18:28.398
You hit an almost
impossible trifecta, bud.

18:28.565 --> 18:31.110
I'm hiring the Assistant Assistant
then, Mr. Lahey!

18:31.193 --> 18:32.486
Excellent.

18:32.569 --> 18:36.156
My trifecta triple-decker
smoked meat Rand-wich.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.491
Let's go collect your winnings.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.493
-All right.
-Here, let's go.

18:39.576 --> 18:42.121
Ta-da!
We're winners, folks!

18:42.329 --> 18:45.040
Make sure you get in all the cracks too
or Bubbles will be whining.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.668
You know what he's fucking like.
Nice job, everybody.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.629
This is what an honest, hard day's work
feels like. Apparently.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.506
You worked really hard, so guess what?

18:52.589 --> 18:56.176
With Brendan's money,
you each get $5.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.427
-What?
-That's ridiculous.

18:57.511 --> 19:01.682
-We worked for eight hours!
-[boy] That's less than a dollar an hour.

19:01.765 --> 19:04.184
It's pretty fucking good,
if you ask me, but anyway...

19:04.268 --> 19:05.477
[Barb] Ricky?

19:06.019 --> 19:09.606
Ricky, it's true? You are actually
putting cow manure under the trailers?

19:09.690 --> 19:12.442
Have you lost your mind?
Mrs. Johnson is livid.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.987
She's... she's threatening
to sue the park.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.781
Does she want to sue the park, or the rats
to stop eating her fucking wires?

19:17.865 --> 19:19.825
The old man used to do this.
There's nothing cheaper,

19:19.908 --> 19:22.286
-nothing works better than cow shit.
-[Barb] Oh, gosh, I see.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.913
So this was one of Ray's techniques?
Okay.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.498
So, I'm sorry to tell you this, Ricky,

19:26.582 --> 19:30.586
but, in fact, your father was probably
one of the stupidest people on the planet.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.087
[Ricky] Oh, is that right?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.131
[Barb] Yes. Yes. I'm sorry,
but that is right.

19:34.214 --> 19:36.758
So what I want, Ricky, is I want a...

19:36.842 --> 19:41.555
I want a solution to the problem,
a real solution, and I want it now!

19:41.638 --> 19:43.348
[Ricky] No problem.
You want a solution right now?

19:43.432 --> 19:45.601
How about go fuck yourself
and deal with that by yourself?

19:45.684 --> 19:47.102
-Children!
-How's that for a fucking solution?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.312
Children!

19:49.229 --> 19:51.023
[sighing] Oh, my fuck.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.692
Kids, I'm sorry that
Barb's being a crusty bitch!

19:53.775 --> 19:56.069
Because she's being a crusty bitch
and now I have no work,

19:56.153 --> 19:58.280
I'm gonna have to take that $5 back.
I'm sorry.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.615
No way.

19:59.698 --> 20:00.866
-What?
-Fuck that.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.576
No fucking way, Ricky.

20:02.659 --> 20:03.994
-I need the money.
-Run for it!

20:04.077 --> 20:05.871
-Go!
-Fuck you!

20:05.954 --> 20:07.623
You fucking prick!

20:07.706 --> 20:10.209
-Fuck you, Ricky!
-[Ricky] You little fuckers!

20:10.292 --> 20:12.336
-The fuck is wrong with kids these days?
-Fuck you, Ricky!

20:12.419 --> 20:15.214
[from afar] Ahhh! Fuck you!

20:15.756 --> 20:16.882
For fuck's sakes.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.844
[Sarah] I'm so excited
to show this to you.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.095
-Right on.
-Ready?

20:22.179 --> 20:23.847
-Yes, I am.
-Come on.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.183
Hey, Bubs, come check out
my new place, man.

20:28.018 --> 20:30.604
Oh, come on, don't be like that, Bubs.

20:30.687 --> 20:33.565
Sorry, Sarah, did you say something
in a deep, muscular voice?

20:33.649 --> 20:38.445
Sort of in a tone you might hear
a gigantic dickhead say it in?

20:39.446 --> 20:43.033
-For fuck's sakes.
-Look, he'll get over it, okay? Let's go.

20:43.116 --> 20:44.493
-Come on.
-My eyes are closed.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.454
Okay, wait. Shoes off, please.
Take your fucking shoes off.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.373
What are you, animals? Jesus.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.708
-Okay, ready?
-All right, I'm ready.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.001
And...

20:53.085 --> 20:54.461
ta-da!

20:54.878 --> 20:56.922
Holy fuck!

20:57.005 --> 20:58.465
Are you kidding me?

20:59.508 --> 21:01.885
Jesus Christ, Sarah!

21:02.469 --> 21:06.139
It's like an MTV Cribs episode here.
This looks just like P. Diddy's place.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.725
-Thank you.
-Look at the sofa, it's perfect here.

21:08.809 --> 21:13.272
-I got the shit smell out of it. Right?
-Oh, right on. Wow!

21:13.355 --> 21:15.315
Um... can you use a coaster, please?

21:15.774 --> 21:17.651
Coaster? Why?
I don't use coasters.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.403
Well, you do now.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.198
Julian, you wanted me to make
your place look nice,

21:23.282 --> 21:24.533
and it looks fucking great, right?

21:24.616 --> 21:27.202
-It looks beautiful.
-Well, if you want it to stay like this,

21:27.286 --> 21:29.288
you're gonna have
to make some changes.

21:37.587 --> 21:38.714
Wow.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.634
Well, here goes nothing.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.223
[knocking]

21:51.476 --> 21:53.228
Oh. Can I help you?

21:53.312 --> 21:57.441
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry I fucking told you
to go fuck yourself.

21:57.816 --> 21:58.984
[laughing] Well, what's new?

21:59.067 --> 22:00.986
I also sort of later on,
I screamed out

22:01.069 --> 22:03.655
that you were a nasty, evil,
crusty whore bitch from hell.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.074
Oh. Well, I didn't know about that.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.536
Well, I did and I'm sorry. I was wondering
if you would let me keep the job.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.788
Oh... Ricky.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.248
No, it's done.

22:13.332 --> 22:17.336
I can't deal with the tenants complaining
about the... about the smell all the time.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.962
I mean, look, I called around.

22:19.046 --> 22:22.466
I know that you do it cheaper
than anybody else around here will,

22:22.549 --> 22:27.179
but I can't ask the residents of Sunnyvale
to deal with manure under their...

22:27.262 --> 22:28.513
under their trailers.

22:28.597 --> 22:31.266
Let me convince the residents.
I mean, shit is the best solution.

22:31.349 --> 22:32.726
-[sighing]
-They just need to realize

22:32.809 --> 22:35.812
that the smell's only going to last three,
four weeks tops. That's not that bad!

22:35.896 --> 22:37.147
Oh, Ricky...

22:37.230 --> 22:38.899
-All right, look...
-I don't know.

22:38.982 --> 22:42.152
Please. I really, really need
this fucking job right now, okay?

22:42.235 --> 22:46.865
I've got no money, Susan just fucking
dumped me, and I'm at the lowest I've been

22:46.948 --> 22:48.241
in a long, long time.

22:50.118 --> 22:51.745
Oh, well, I'm...

22:53.163 --> 22:55.749
I'm sorry to hear about Susan.
I didn't...

22:56.374 --> 22:59.711
And I mean, I...
I can... I can relate.

22:59.795 --> 23:03.048
I-I'm not feeling
any too great myself these days.

23:05.258 --> 23:06.593
Look...

23:07.302 --> 23:09.721
why don't you come
inside for a drink?

23:09.805 --> 23:12.599
If you can show me one or...

23:14.351 --> 23:16.394
two or...

23:17.729 --> 23:20.107
three good reasons

23:20.190 --> 23:21.817
why I should let you keep your job,

23:21.900 --> 23:23.193
then... um...

23:24.194 --> 23:25.987
maybe I'll reconsider.

23:28.532 --> 23:29.783
[sigh]

23:30.367 --> 23:32.702
All right, let's get this going.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.413
Where and how do you want me?

23:37.916 --> 23:40.418
[theme music]

24:21.710 --> 24:23.962
[seagulls squawking]

24:35.599 --> 24:39.311
[fish] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

24:40.937 --> 24:43.690
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

24:46.651 --> 24:48.028
[whispering] Fuck.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.322
-[light clicks off]
-Fuck off.
