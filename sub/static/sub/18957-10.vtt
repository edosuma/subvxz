01:13.940 --> 01:15.207
I'm sorry.

it close, don't you?

01:31.757 --> 01:35.027
I assume you have something for me.

01:39.031 --> 01:40.967
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

01:42.634 --> 01:43.769
You look like shit.

01:43.835 --> 01:45.437
It's all there.

01:45.504 --> 01:47.306
Oh, I don't doubt it's all there.

01:47.373 --> 01:50.142
- Richie.
- Yeah, Richie, grab the money.

02:03.055 --> 02:04.523
So tell me, Marius...

02:06.258 --> 02:08.860
what's it feel like, right now,

02:08.995 --> 02:11.030
seeing her again?

02:17.003 --> 02:18.704
Is that why you brought her here?

02:20.006 --> 02:21.773
To rub it in?

02:21.840 --> 02:23.242
Yeah.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.876
No.

02:25.011 --> 02:26.178
Well, maybe a little.

02:26.345 --> 02:28.314
Because if you don't
mind, I'd like to get Eddie

02:28.315 --> 02:30.051
and get the fuck out of here, all right?

02:30.082 --> 02:31.417
Yeah, well, about that, listen.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.387
About what? About... About what?

02:33.519 --> 02:34.586
About nothing.

02:34.653 --> 02:36.055
Eddie is free

02:36.122 --> 02:38.024
to come and go as he pleases.

02:38.090 --> 02:39.825
I'm a man of my word.

02:39.891 --> 02:42.761
You, however, is a different story.

02:42.828 --> 02:47.066
Look, I need to keep you
here until Winslow shows up.

02:50.036 --> 02:51.937
So that's it?

02:52.038 --> 02:53.572
I'm dead?

02:55.374 --> 02:57.209
There's no Door Number 2?

What do you think?

02:59.878 --> 03:00.912
Hmm.

03:01.047 --> 03:02.781
Do you want to tell him my idea?

03:02.848 --> 03:04.350
- Sure.
- Tell him.

03:04.416 --> 03:07.186
Vince has a big player who's cheating.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.521
And what does that have to do with me?

03:09.588 --> 03:11.957
Well, he can't spot it,
and he thinks you can.

03:12.058 --> 03:13.692
So kick him out of your game.

03:13.759 --> 03:16.195
Can't do that unless
I catch him in the act.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.397
- So play him yourself.
- He already did.

03:18.464 --> 03:19.731
And he beat you?

03:23.469 --> 03:24.736
Yeah.

03:24.803 --> 03:27.673
He beat me 'cause he cheats.

03:27.739 --> 03:29.275
Do you get the point?

03:29.341 --> 03:30.409
Yeah.

03:30.476 --> 03:31.843
So what do you want to do, huh?

03:31.910 --> 03:33.612
You in, or you out?

03:36.882 --> 03:37.983
What's in it for you?

03:38.084 --> 03:39.418
How about this?

03:39.485 --> 03:42.088
I tell Winslow to stand down

03:42.154 --> 03:45.157
so that you can keep on breathing.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.693
How about that?

03:52.464 --> 03:55.301
So you just want to catch him cheating,

- Vinnie.
- Hey.

05:20.748 --> 05:21.749
How you doing, buddy?

05:21.816 --> 05:23.117
Marty Joseph. Long time.

05:23.184 --> 05:25.286
Yeah, I've been playing
out on the Left Coast.

05:25.387 --> 05:27.021
I'm not too crazy about their politics,

05:27.088 --> 05:28.623

Raj Kumar Mukherjee.

05:42.136 --> 05:44.639
Ah, I know that name.

05:44.706 --> 05:46.440

05:46.507 --> 05:49.510

- Why did you bring Taylor?

07:01.548 --> 07:02.684

- You have to get out of here.
- Grandma.

07:04.352 --> 07:05.486
You have to get out of here!

07:05.486 --> 07:07.020
- Just tell me what happened.
- Taylor!

- Tell me what happened.
- Taylor!

She's right! You can't
be a part of this!

- Ohh!

- Call.
- That's good.

07:49.230 --> 07:50.297
What is that?

07:50.364 --> 07:52.199
A Rolex.

07:52.266 --> 07:53.500
That's nice.

07:53.567 --> 07:54.736
I know.

08:00.407 --> 08:01.909

[sniff]

08:21.829 --> 08:23.931
So I do this... [sniff].

08:23.998 --> 08:25.833
That means I'm talking to you.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.035
You look at my hand.

08:28.102 --> 08:32.006
My left pinkie means
Mukherjee is palming.

08:32.073 --> 08:35.342
My left ring finger means he's daubing,

08:35.409 --> 08:37.644
- which is marking.
- I know what daubing is.

08:37.779 --> 08:42.784
Okay. My left thumb is, uh, fold.

08:49.456 --> 08:50.557

09:20.822 --> 09:22.623
- Flush gets it.
- Ha ha.

09:22.689 --> 09:23.858
Oh! Not flush!

09:23.925 --> 09:25.860
- Oh!
- Flush takes it.

09:25.927 --> 09:27.895
I... I thought that was a high pair.

09:27.962 --> 09:29.563
Sorry to disappoint you.

09:29.630 --> 09:31.532
Ah, it's better to be disappointed

09:31.598 --> 09:32.666
in cards than in love.

09:32.733 --> 09:35.002
I am seldom disappointed in either.

09:36.437 --> 09:37.504
What?

09:42.877 --> 09:44.178
Surprise.

09:44.245 --> 09:46.547
Jesus, Julia, what are you doing here?

09:46.613 --> 09:47.815
Hello, Chayton.

09:47.882 --> 09:50.051
Used to come here with
Audrey when you were younger.

09:50.117 --> 09:52.386
Still remembered how to get here.

09:52.453 --> 09:53.955
I want to talk.

09:54.021 --> 09:55.389
Unless you have my money,

09:55.456 --> 09:56.723
there's nothing to talk about.

09:56.790 --> 09:58.192
We can talk about the money later.

09:58.259 --> 09:59.793
I'm here to talk about this one.

09:59.861 --> 10:01.295
- Julia...
- Shut up.

10:02.596 --> 10:03.898
He's no use to you.

10:03.965 --> 10:06.033
I'd argue he's no use to anybody,

10:06.100 --> 10:08.802
but he's still the
father of my son, so...

10:08.870 --> 10:10.304
I need him alive.

10:10.371 --> 10:11.772
Well, if he'd stayed out of it,

10:11.839 --> 10:13.440
my money would still be in that safe.

10:13.507 --> 10:15.609
He didn't take the money
out of the safe. Audrey did.

10:15.676 --> 10:17.511
This is between our two families.

10:17.578 --> 10:19.746
Julia, there's a door behind you. Run.

10:19.813 --> 10:21.715
- Lance, put that fucking thing down...
- Go!

10:21.782 --> 10:23.517
... or I'll punch you in the dick.

10:25.352 --> 10:26.854
Put it down.

10:26.921 --> 10:28.655
Okay, there's a real
simple way out of this.

10:28.722 --> 10:30.591
- Not now.
- The farm's worth a lot of money.

10:30.657 --> 10:31.959
They just found out it's sitting

10:31.959 --> 10:33.460
on top of a massive uranium deposit.

10:33.494 --> 10:35.162
Lance, you idiot, there's no uranium.

10:35.229 --> 10:38.299
Yes, there is. I took a
Geiger counter out there...

10:38.365 --> 10:40.101
We conned you!

10:40.167 --> 10:42.336
Pete, his mother, the old man...

10:42.403 --> 10:44.105
it was all a con to get the money back.

10:44.171 --> 10:45.973
The farm's not worth shit.

10:47.241 --> 10:49.576
Now beat it. I need to talk to Chayton.

11:10.831 --> 11:12.433
So talk.

11:18.405 --> 11:19.773
Audrey: He slammed on the brakes

11:19.840 --> 11:21.976
and grabbed my arm to take the gun.

11:22.043 --> 11:23.610
That's all I remember.

11:27.248 --> 11:30.384
When you woke up, you still
had the gun in your hand.

11:30.451 --> 11:33.087
Yeah.

11:33.154 --> 11:35.457
How could Pete just have left you here?

11:35.490 --> 11:37.491
How can he have taken that
money that we needed...

11:37.558 --> 11:39.060
Forget about the money, Otto.

11:39.126 --> 11:41.162
We have a dead cop here,

11:41.228 --> 11:42.863
and I was holding the gun.

11:42.964 --> 11:45.232
You understand what that means?

11:48.970 --> 11:51.405
I got a guy killed today, too.

11:51.472 --> 11:53.207
You what?

11:53.274 --> 11:54.675
- [gunshot]
- Oh!

11:55.809 --> 11:57.111
He was a dirty cop.

11:57.178 --> 11:58.545
I had a falling out

11:58.612 --> 12:00.114
with the guy who was paying him.

12:00.181 --> 12:01.415
They drove him off the road,

12:01.482 --> 12:03.484
put two in his chest, one in his head,

12:03.550 --> 12:05.052
like the pros do.

12:05.119 --> 12:06.820
What about the tire tracks?

12:06.887 --> 12:08.155
We'll just have to hope

12:08.222 --> 12:09.590
that CSI's as shitty out here

12:09.656 --> 12:10.992
as it is in Bridgeport.

12:13.260 --> 12:15.196
Yeah. No, no, no. That s...

12:15.262 --> 12:16.763
That sounds right.

12:16.830 --> 12:19.633
Okay. Uh, I owe you, Lenny.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.302
Time to sleep.

12:21.368 --> 12:24.371
Word is Winslow was moonlighting,

12:24.438 --> 12:27.108
doing dirty work for an old buddy...

12:27.174 --> 12:30.477
retired NYPD hard-ass
named Vince Lonigan.

12:30.544 --> 12:32.246
- Vince?
- Yeah.

12:33.647 --> 12:35.016
When we were at Pinetop,

12:35.016 --> 12:37.084
Pete was scared shitless
of some guy named Vince.

12:37.151 --> 12:39.853
Well, Lenny says this guy has a...

12:39.920 --> 12:41.588
has a poker room in the city,

12:41.655 --> 12:42.789
in Chinatown.

12:42.856 --> 12:45.126
You get an address?

12:49.030 --> 12:50.197
Let's go.

12:51.765 --> 12:53.534
- So that's it?
- Yes.

12:54.635 --> 12:56.037
What did you guys talk about?

12:56.103 --> 12:57.538
None of your fucking business.

13:01.875 --> 13:04.378
20,000.

13:04.445 --> 13:07.181
Raise to 40,000.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.717
- I'm out.

It's your action, boss.

14:28.229 --> 14:30.131
Put the deck on the table.

14:31.432 --> 14:33.567
Take your hands away from your cards.

Nobody.

14:54.855 --> 14:57.824
Ladies and gentlemen,
with my apologies...

14:59.593 --> 15:02.496
I need to ask you to leave at this time.

15:02.563 --> 15:05.332
Dennis, Richie, would
you escort everybody out

15:05.399 --> 15:07.601
who's not at this table?

15:07.668 --> 15:10.671
Wally, you can stay
and Karolina, of course.

15:10.737 --> 15:12.439
[clapping hands] All
right, come on, folks.

15:12.506 --> 15:14.441
You heard the man. It's
time to get out of here.

15:14.508 --> 15:16.343
You got to go home or, you know.

15:16.410 --> 15:17.944
Come on. Put a fire under it.

15:18.011 --> 15:19.880
- Let's go.
- [murmuring]

15:22.916 --> 15:25.519
- Hey, I left my, uh...
- Get the fuck out, Tate.

15:25.586 --> 15:26.787
Get out.

15:27.854 --> 15:29.390
You, too.

15:34.861 --> 15:36.297
Vince, what are you doing?

15:36.363 --> 15:38.732
How long...

15:38.799 --> 15:42.436
did you think I would ride that?

15:42.503 --> 15:43.904
Ride what?

15:43.970 --> 15:46.440
Marius, did you really think

15:46.507 --> 15:48.842
I wouldn't snap to a play like this?

15:48.909 --> 15:51.945
Giving me the "all in"
signal at that very moment?

15:52.012 --> 15:53.780
Wait. He signaled you?

15:53.847 --> 15:54.981
Were you cheating me?

15:55.048 --> 15:56.350
No, you miserable prick.

15:56.417 --> 15:57.784
You were cheating me...

15:57.851 --> 16:00.221
you and Marius and Eddie...

16:01.588 --> 16:03.224
and you.

16:03.224 --> 16:04.825
Vince, I... I swear I...

16:04.891 --> 16:07.127
Just don't. Just sit down.

16:07.228 --> 16:08.929
Sit down.

16:08.995 --> 16:11.965
My friend, whatever you think
I've done, you're mistaken.

16:12.032 --> 16:13.500
I'm not your fucking friend.

16:13.567 --> 16:16.237
And we'll find out if
I'm mistaken, right?

16:16.303 --> 16:18.572
My guess is that...

16:18.639 --> 16:21.542
your pockets are pretty strong.

16:21.608 --> 16:23.744
Shall we take a look
at what you got? Hmm?

16:23.810 --> 16:26.313
Keep your hands away from the cards.

16:27.714 --> 16:28.949
Jacks.

16:29.015 --> 16:31.252
Jacks and 10s. Nice hand.

16:31.285 --> 16:34.087
But I've got queens and 10s,

16:34.154 --> 16:35.422
and I'm on a flush draw,

16:35.489 --> 16:38.259
so right now I'm feeling pretty good.

16:38.259 --> 16:40.594
I'm about to take you
down for a lot of money.

16:40.661 --> 16:44.097
Huh? And just then I
get the "all in" signal

16:44.164 --> 16:45.532
from Marius,

16:45.599 --> 16:48.134
and I'm just about to do it.

16:48.269 --> 16:49.670
And then...

16:51.705 --> 16:54.074
everything just...

16:54.140 --> 16:55.909
slows down for me.

16:58.111 --> 16:59.413
You ever get that feeling

16:59.480 --> 17:02.048
where you think you've been here before?

17:02.115 --> 17:03.450
You know, déjÃ  vu,

17:03.517 --> 17:07.921
where everything you said and did...

17:07.988 --> 17:10.391
everything was like before?

17:12.125 --> 17:15.194
The hairs on the back
of your neck stand up,

17:15.296 --> 17:20.300
but you can't quite put
your finger on where or when.

17:23.537 --> 17:28.309
But for me, right now, I can.

17:28.309 --> 17:32.313
I remember exactly where I was

17:32.379 --> 17:34.415
and when it was...

17:35.949 --> 17:38.018
and who I was with.

17:40.987 --> 17:42.789
Isn't that right, Marius?

17:42.856 --> 17:44.224
Vince.

17:44.325 --> 17:47.027
Yeah. A little over three years ago.

17:47.093 --> 17:49.129
Oh, the room was different,

17:49.195 --> 17:52.433
and the whale was different.

17:56.069 --> 17:58.839
But it was the same young lady...

18:00.106 --> 18:01.908
leading me to my doom.

18:01.975 --> 18:03.344
Baby, that isn't true.

18:03.377 --> 18:05.346
No, I know. That was the reaction

18:05.412 --> 18:07.348
that I had, too, at first.

18:07.348 --> 18:08.915
I thought, No, this can't be

18:08.982 --> 18:12.252
because I've given her everything...

18:12.353 --> 18:15.121
food and clothing, shelter.

18:15.188 --> 18:17.658
And I shared with her

18:17.724 --> 18:19.693
my most intimate thoughts.

18:21.462 --> 18:23.029
This girl...

18:23.096 --> 18:26.433
uh, really cares for me,

18:26.500 --> 18:28.869
maybe even loves me.

18:30.070 --> 18:31.605
So no.

18:31.672 --> 18:34.441
It can't be. She wouldn't...

18:34.508 --> 18:36.009
wouldn't do this to me.

18:36.076 --> 18:37.378
But then...

18:39.413 --> 18:40.781
then I just... I just...

18:42.215 --> 18:44.551
[sigh]... run it back through my mind.

18:44.618 --> 18:46.920
Right?

18:46.987 --> 18:48.589
And I realize...

18:50.090 --> 18:51.692
that all this week...

18:54.294 --> 18:57.798
you were guiding me to this moment.

18:57.864 --> 18:58.899
No.

18:58.965 --> 19:00.233
- No.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:00.300 --> 19:03.003
Ever so gently,

19:03.069 --> 19:04.405
but you were.

19:04.405 --> 19:08.475
You've been leading me right here...

19:10.076 --> 19:12.145
where I play in my own game

19:12.212 --> 19:14.848
in my own poker room.

19:14.915 --> 19:17.651
And once again...

19:17.718 --> 19:21.522
I find my fate in the hands of Marius.

19:21.588 --> 19:24.591
All the elements of a classic con.

19:26.627 --> 19:28.495
Eddie's the mechanic.

19:28.562 --> 19:30.096
Mukherjee's the whale.

19:31.498 --> 19:33.567
Marius, the captain,

19:33.634 --> 19:36.002
and you, sweetheart...

19:38.204 --> 19:39.673
you're the rope.

19:46.580 --> 19:49.049
- [gasping]
- Vince.

19:49.115 --> 19:50.651
And I have the mark.

19:52.886 --> 19:53.887
Vince.

19:58.391 --> 19:59.726
Vince!

20:00.994 --> 20:02.328
Vince!

20:02.395 --> 20:03.630
[coughing]

20:08.435 --> 20:09.636
Ohh!

20:09.703 --> 20:11.972
I would love to be wrong.

20:12.038 --> 20:13.239
[cough]

20:13.306 --> 20:15.141
But I don't think that I am.

20:17.377 --> 20:19.713
There's one way to find out for sure.

20:23.216 --> 20:24.851
So...

20:24.918 --> 20:26.086
I had this game.

20:26.152 --> 20:28.889
- It's mine... tight.
- [Karolina gasping]

20:30.891 --> 20:34.094
You had no chance of winning this hand,

20:34.160 --> 20:36.497
no chance... well, one.

20:36.563 --> 20:38.431
You had one chance,

20:38.499 --> 20:40.567
one out

20:40.634 --> 20:42.603
the jack of spades.

20:43.570 --> 20:45.305
What's it, about 2%, Eddie?

20:45.371 --> 20:46.707
That's it.

20:46.773 --> 20:49.543
So if this next card's a jack of spades,

20:49.610 --> 20:51.745
you all were trying to fuck me.

20:57.417 --> 20:59.886
Why don't you tell me what it is, honey?

20:59.953 --> 21:00.987
Hmm?

21:09.429 --> 21:11.665
If I'd have listened to you, Marius,

21:11.732 --> 21:14.100
I'd have lost all my money, hmm?

21:14.167 --> 21:17.638
But of course that was
the plan, wasn't it?

21:17.704 --> 21:19.540
Feeding me the cards. Wasn't it?

21:19.606 --> 21:20.641
Hmm?

21:20.707 --> 21:22.809
What I want from you now

21:22.876 --> 21:27.247
is to finally drop the con

21:27.313 --> 21:29.716
and admit...

21:29.783 --> 21:31.918
that I fucking got you.

21:33.419 --> 21:35.288
- Maybe this will help.
- [whimper]

21:35.355 --> 21:36.590
You got three seconds

21:36.657 --> 21:38.625
before I put a bullet
in your fucking head.

21:38.692 --> 21:40.260
- 1, 2...
- Don't... Don't... Don't...

21:40.326 --> 21:42.563
Don't shoot. Don't
shoot. Don't shoot, okay?

21:42.563 --> 21:44.665
I'll tell you. Okay, yes.

21:44.731 --> 21:45.866
Yeah, everything...

21:45.932 --> 21:47.333
everything you said was right.

21:47.468 --> 21:48.802
Okay? Karolina told me

21:48.803 --> 21:50.370
that Marius and her were working again,

21:50.403 --> 21:52.472
and they hired this guy
right here to be the whale.

21:52.573 --> 21:53.874
This isn't true. He's lying.

21:53.940 --> 21:54.975
Shut up!

22:01.381 --> 22:04.585
Richie, find his phone on him.

22:10.356 --> 22:11.792
[beep]

22:11.858 --> 22:15.061
All right, what's
your password, asshole?

22:15.128 --> 22:18.665
B-O-L-L-Y...

22:19.600 --> 22:21.935
924.

22:22.002 --> 22:24.204
Bolly?

22:24.270 --> 22:26.006
Fuck me.

22:29.610 --> 22:32.145
Let's go to recent calls, shall we?

22:34.314 --> 22:35.816
Uh... uh...

22:35.882 --> 22:40.687
you got a call from someone
with the initials M.J.

22:41.888 --> 22:43.256
Who do you think that could be?

22:43.323 --> 22:45.425
Hmm?

22:45.491 --> 22:48.094
We should try it.

22:48.161 --> 22:49.162
[beep]

22:50.530 --> 22:52.032
[phone rings]

22:53.399 --> 22:54.635
[ring]

22:54.701 --> 22:57.137
Marius, aren't you
going to pick that up?

22:57.203 --> 22:59.205
- [ring]
- Might be important.

22:59.272 --> 23:01.507
[ring]

23:01.642 --> 23:02.876
Hmm?

23:02.943 --> 23:05.846
[ring]

23:05.912 --> 23:08.181
[ring]

23:09.349 --> 23:10.651
[ring... beep off]

23:13.987 --> 23:14.988
Well?

23:21.662 --> 23:23.964
What's there left to say, huh, Marius?

23:26.132 --> 23:27.533
I'm tired.

23:27.668 --> 23:29.836
Of course you are.

23:29.903 --> 23:32.272
I should have killed
you three years ago.

23:32.338 --> 23:34.074
All of you.

23:34.140 --> 23:36.943
Would have made my life a lot easier.

23:37.010 --> 23:39.012
Well, you live and learn.

23:42.182 --> 23:44.517
[whisper] I'm going to kill you last

23:44.584 --> 23:47.120
so you can watch your brother die.

23:47.187 --> 23:48.689
But first,

23:48.689 --> 23:51.357
I'm going to deal with that asshole.

23:54.227 --> 23:56.563
Oh, I've been waiting to put
a bullet in your fucking head

23:56.630 --> 23:58.331
- for a long time.
- Vince, I swear to God.

23:58.331 --> 24:00.033
- I don't... I swear...
- Put the gun down!

24:00.034 --> 24:02.336
Hey! I'm... I'm FBI.

24:02.435 --> 24:05.438
Okay? This man is a federal
witness under my protection.

24:05.505 --> 24:07.874
I just sent a distress code
to the FBI field office.

24:07.941 --> 24:12.112
Fuck me. My head is spinning right now.

24:12.178 --> 24:14.314
Marius, is this... is
this part of the plan,

24:14.380 --> 24:17.083
or are you just making this
shit up as you go along?

24:17.150 --> 24:20.221
Call the FBI... special agent
in charge Michael Dumbrovski.

24:20.221 --> 24:21.855
He'll confirm everything
I'm telling you.

24:21.922 --> 24:23.156
My God, you're good.

24:23.223 --> 24:25.726
You're the fixer, right? Of course.

24:26.993 --> 24:29.429
You never drop the con,
even when you're blown.

24:29.495 --> 24:30.731
You're a pro.

24:30.764 --> 24:31.998
[all shouting]

24:33.366 --> 24:34.768
- Vince, I swear...
- Mukherjee...

24:34.835 --> 24:36.202
- Please...
- No, no, no, no, no!

24:36.269 --> 24:38.138
Please don't! Please!

24:38.204 --> 24:39.372
Hey!

24:42.042 --> 24:43.476
- Drop to the ground!
- We... We...

24:43.543 --> 24:44.745
Now! Do it!

24:44.811 --> 24:46.579
We're just licensed bodyguards.

24:46.646 --> 24:48.614
All right. G-Gun on the floor.

24:48.749 --> 24:51.885
- Unarmed.
- [grunting]

24:51.952 --> 24:54.254
[police sirens in distance]

24:54.320 --> 24:56.289
It's over.

24:56.356 --> 24:58.324
Let's go. Let's go!

25:04.958 --> 25:07.258
_

25:15.065 --> 25:16.367
Took you long enough.

25:16.434 --> 25:18.469
- Let's go!
- [sirens blaring]

25:20.938 --> 25:22.640
Let's go, go, go, go!

25:29.880 --> 25:31.416
Are we good?

25:31.482 --> 25:32.883
Yeah, we're good.

25:32.950 --> 25:34.785
How the fuck are we good?

25:34.852 --> 25:37.221
Vince caught on to us
before we even got started.

25:37.322 --> 25:39.790
"Good." Fuck, is it me? Did I fuck up?

25:39.857 --> 25:42.327
Eddie. Eddie, I got
a confession to make.

25:42.327 --> 25:43.961
What?

25:44.028 --> 25:45.330
We didn't tell you everything.

25:45.396 --> 25:46.497
What are you talking about?

25:46.564 --> 25:48.333
Mukherjee wasn't somebody

25:48.399 --> 25:49.700
that we hired, okay?

25:49.701 --> 25:51.302
He didn't even know he was part of it.

25:51.303 --> 25:52.505
Who the fuck is he?

25:52.603 --> 25:54.138
He's a tech billionaire from Mumbai.

25:54.138 --> 25:55.907
- What?
- We needed a handle,

25:55.940 --> 25:57.775
someone who'd get under Vince's skin.

25:57.842 --> 26:00.044
We had an inside guy scout the players.

26:00.110 --> 26:01.612
- Tate.
- Tate's job

26:01.679 --> 26:03.714
was to get into Vince's
room and find the handle.

26:03.781 --> 26:05.683
Mukherjee was more than worth the wait.

26:05.750 --> 26:08.018
The real kicker was Joseph discovering

26:08.085 --> 26:10.988
that Mukherjee was a federal informant

26:11.055 --> 26:13.658
and his bodyguard is FBI.

26:13.724 --> 26:16.561
[siren]

26:18.496 --> 26:20.365
[police radio chatter]

26:20.365 --> 26:22.367
Holy shit.

26:26.404 --> 26:27.672
Otto: It's too late.

26:28.873 --> 26:30.575
The money's gone.

26:35.980 --> 26:37.448
I'll take you home.

26:51.295 --> 26:52.530
You're late.

26:53.731 --> 26:55.433
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.602
I thought maybe you got
somebody else killed.

26:57.668 --> 26:59.404
Took the long way in
case we were followed.

26:59.470 --> 27:00.905
Come on. We got to keep moving.

27:00.971 --> 27:02.707
- Where's our nurse?
- He's not a nurse,

27:02.773 --> 27:04.274
and he couldn't go until we left.

27:04.409 --> 27:05.510
Wait a second. Wait.

27:05.511 --> 27:07.046
If Mukherjee wasn't involved, Marius,

27:07.048 --> 27:08.917
how the fuck did he have your number?

27:08.918 --> 27:10.052
Uh, that was me.

27:10.114 --> 27:12.583
I didn't have time to
set up anything fancy.

27:12.650 --> 27:15.486
So the fool got an idea
he had a shot at Karolina.

27:15.553 --> 27:17.922
Wasn't thinking about anything else.

27:19.089 --> 27:20.691
So I got the smack pit out

27:20.758 --> 27:22.893
without having to kiss the dog.

27:28.566 --> 27:30.435
Handed her off to Joseph,

27:30.435 --> 27:32.437
and before I had time to wash my hands,

27:32.503 --> 27:33.838
it was done.

27:33.904 --> 27:36.541
The phone was back in Mukherjee's pocket

27:36.607 --> 27:38.142
before he knew it was gone.

27:38.208 --> 27:39.644
[chuckling]

27:39.710 --> 27:42.046
What if Vince shot him?

27:42.112 --> 27:43.313
You ever think about that?

27:43.314 --> 27:44.615
Of course we thought about that.

27:44.615 --> 27:46.116
Look, whenever there's a threat

27:46.183 --> 27:47.452
against a federal witness,

27:47.485 --> 27:48.986
the FBI takes special precautions

27:49.053 --> 27:50.455
for several days,

27:50.521 --> 27:53.090
so I've been calling in anonymous tips

27:53.157 --> 27:54.459
for the past six months,

27:54.459 --> 27:55.960
the last one just a couple days ago.

27:55.961 --> 27:57.296
[whisper] Face the entrance.

27:57.297 --> 27:58.699
And last night I checked them both

27:58.700 --> 28:00.569
for their vests and
Wally for his ankle gun.

28:00.631 --> 28:02.366
And if anything was missing,

28:02.467 --> 28:03.734
I was going to pull the plug.

28:03.801 --> 28:05.803
Are you kidding me? That
was a huge fucking risk.

28:05.870 --> 28:07.705
Yeah. There's always a risk.

28:07.772 --> 28:09.474
Yeah, but it didn't work.

28:09.540 --> 28:11.609
Vince shot a federal agent in the chest.

28:11.676 --> 28:14.144
He's going to do what,
20 years? It worked.

28:14.211 --> 28:15.646
Yeah, but the money.

28:17.247 --> 28:19.049
This wasn't about money, Eddie.

28:21.085 --> 28:22.487
This was about Charlie.

28:22.553 --> 28:24.221
For all the fucked-up things

28:24.288 --> 28:25.556
I've done in my life,

28:25.623 --> 28:27.725
whoo! That takes the cake.

28:27.792 --> 28:29.694
- Nurse is here.
- Marjorie: He's not a nurse.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.062
I'm not lying. This was about revenge.

28:32.129 --> 28:34.699
Ah. But revenge...

28:35.900 --> 28:38.503
revenge is so much sweeter with this.

28:39.369 --> 28:40.505
Wow.

28:40.571 --> 28:42.707
It was a barometric safe.

28:42.773 --> 28:44.575
I know. They're a bitch.

28:44.642 --> 28:47.111
Looked into freezing
it with liquid nitrogen.

28:47.177 --> 28:50.114
I looked into drilling
and filling it with water,

28:50.180 --> 28:51.516
doing a concussion.

28:51.549 --> 28:53.951
Ah, I had a hard time
finding this place.

28:54.018 --> 28:56.854
You need to go down and show
everyone how to get up here.

28:56.921 --> 28:58.823
Come on. I got this.

28:59.990 --> 29:02.793
I even went down a
crazy DARPA rabbit hole

29:02.860 --> 29:06.597
of the haptic gloves with
the fingerprint interface.

29:06.664 --> 29:08.833
But in the end,

29:08.899 --> 29:11.401
I realized I didn't
have to crack the safe.

29:11.536 --> 29:14.038
- I just had to crack Vince.
- Aah!

29:18.342 --> 29:20.545
Son of a bitch.

29:25.616 --> 29:27.552
Who's handling Joseph's cut?

29:27.585 --> 29:28.953
Uh, he asked me to.

29:31.255 --> 29:33.290
Oh, shit. Sorry, Marius.

29:33.357 --> 29:34.759
You heard about Winslow?

29:37.261 --> 29:39.329
Found dead in the Connecticut woods.

29:39.396 --> 29:42.232
Police chatter says it looks
like a professional hit.

29:42.299 --> 29:44.201
You got lucky.

29:52.610 --> 29:53.811
Ahem.

30:00.284 --> 30:02.319
To be honest,

30:02.386 --> 30:03.821
he was a so-so husband.

30:03.888 --> 30:06.624
But he was a good friend.

30:06.691 --> 30:09.259
He was a great dancer,

30:09.326 --> 30:11.796
and he was an excellent con.

30:13.230 --> 30:15.700
And he was the brother
that you never had.

30:21.238 --> 30:22.339
So to Charlie.

30:22.406 --> 30:24.274
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

30:24.341 --> 30:25.843
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

30:25.910 --> 30:26.911
Charlie.

30:40.791 --> 30:42.259
No, you don't have to do that.

30:46.396 --> 30:47.898
Charlie.

30:58.075 --> 30:59.810
What? I didn't know the guy.

31:14.458 --> 31:17.027
All right, man. Take it easy.

31:24.902 --> 31:27.137
All right, go ahead, say it.

31:29.439 --> 31:30.775
That wasn't a Turk.

31:30.841 --> 31:33.978
There were moving parts.

31:35.345 --> 31:36.681
Well, it was pretty close.

31:36.714 --> 31:39.216
That wasn't The Turk.

31:41.485 --> 31:43.253
It was a damn sweet con.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.755
Ha ha ha ha!

31:44.822 --> 31:46.791
We'll get it right next time, all right?

31:47.692 --> 31:49.159
Yeah.

31:49.226 --> 31:50.394
I'll see you around.

31:50.460 --> 31:52.697
[laughing]

31:53.731 --> 31:54.899
Later, Porter.

31:54.965 --> 31:56.801
Keep out of trouble, Eddie!

32:01.605 --> 32:03.507
[car engine starts]

32:03.573 --> 32:06.010
So where are we going?

32:06.076 --> 32:08.078
How about to Vegas with me?

32:09.379 --> 32:10.715
Vegas?

32:10.748 --> 32:12.883
I'm buying a stake in a little casino.

32:12.950 --> 32:15.986
You can deal or, I don't
know, security. You choose.

32:16.053 --> 32:17.922
You always wanted to deal in Vegas.

32:17.988 --> 32:20.224
- Yeah, but you hate Vegas.
- I do.

32:21.726 --> 32:23.493
I'm not going with you.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.462
No, seriously.

32:25.529 --> 32:28.198
Eddie, I got a parole
officer I got to worry about.

32:28.265 --> 32:29.333
Uh...

32:30.400 --> 32:31.435
Then no. Then fuck it.

32:31.436 --> 32:33.003
I'm not going. I'll stay here with you.

32:33.004 --> 32:34.438
- Eddie. Eddie.
- What...

32:34.471 --> 32:37.808
It's time we went our
separate ways, Eddie.

32:39.509 --> 32:40.544
What?

32:40.610 --> 32:41.746
[taxi door opens]

32:41.779 --> 32:42.913
No. No.

32:42.980 --> 32:44.782
It's always been me
and you our whole lives.

32:44.849 --> 32:46.183
And look where that's gotten you.

32:46.250 --> 32:48.152
Look, I don't blame
you for any of this...

32:48.218 --> 32:50.187
But you should. I'm the
one who got you into it.

32:50.254 --> 32:52.589
- That's not true.
- I always get you into it.

32:52.656 --> 32:54.024
Eddie.

32:54.091 --> 32:55.826
Eddie, why do you think

32:55.893 --> 32:58.262
you weren't kissed in all of this?

33:00.064 --> 33:01.999
Because you figured
you couldn't trust me.

33:02.066 --> 33:04.201
- I get it.
- I do trust you.

33:05.269 --> 33:07.204
Eddie, I trust you.

33:07.271 --> 33:09.673
I knew, when Vince put a gun to my head,

33:09.774 --> 33:11.408
you'd cough it up just to save me.

33:13.143 --> 33:15.980
You can't help it,
Eddie. You're a good guy.

33:18.816 --> 33:20.150
You're not cut out for the life.

33:20.217 --> 33:22.152
- Am I right?
- No, it's not true.

33:22.219 --> 33:23.287
Am I right?

33:23.353 --> 33:24.922
I'm right.

33:30.127 --> 33:31.796
Oh, fuck.

33:36.566 --> 33:37.802
Come here.

33:52.950 --> 33:54.952
We should get going, Eddie.

34:07.097 --> 34:08.398
Get the fuck out of here.

34:13.838 --> 34:16.106
You take care of my brother, all right?

34:17.241 --> 34:19.409
You take care of yourself, all right?

34:23.547 --> 34:24.714
Motherfucker.

34:24.849 --> 34:26.083
[engine starts]

34:45.802 --> 34:48.502
_

35:13.076 --> 35:14.678
What the hell are you doing here?

35:14.744 --> 35:18.915
I get a panic call from Carly
in the middle of the night.

35:18.982 --> 35:21.918
She's worried about you guys.

35:21.985 --> 35:25.422
I told her I'd come check.

35:25.489 --> 35:27.857
Where the hell have you been?

35:27.924 --> 35:30.026
I'm gonna go make some calls.

35:30.093 --> 35:31.828
See what I can find out.

35:33.730 --> 35:34.798
Sam.

35:38.101 --> 35:40.870
You didn't need to come here.

35:40.937 --> 35:42.339
Jesus, Audrey.

35:42.406 --> 35:43.607
You all right?

35:43.673 --> 35:44.708
Hey, hey, hey.

35:44.774 --> 35:46.210
It's none of your fucking business.

35:46.243 --> 35:48.578
Whatever happened, we're still friends.

35:48.645 --> 35:49.746
Yeah.

35:49.813 --> 35:51.781
Well, so...

35:51.848 --> 35:54.218
we're here. We're fine.

35:54.218 --> 35:55.919
You can go now.

35:58.488 --> 35:59.556
Otto.

36:04.361 --> 36:05.862
I need a word.

36:11.034 --> 36:12.269
All right.

36:13.370 --> 36:14.738
I'm listening.

36:16.773 --> 36:19.276
I want to clear the air about something.

36:21.745 --> 36:24.681
You know, when you were sick,

36:24.748 --> 36:26.650
Audrey and I...

36:29.953 --> 36:31.855
were alone in the office...

36:33.990 --> 36:35.559
a lot.

36:35.625 --> 36:38.395
And I...

36:40.697 --> 36:41.765
I hit on her.

36:41.831 --> 36:43.500
You son of a bitch.

36:43.567 --> 36:44.568
You know what she did?

36:44.634 --> 36:47.537
She punched me in the nose.

36:48.405 --> 36:49.473
And I had it coming.

36:49.539 --> 36:52.276
That's why I left for A&B.

36:52.342 --> 36:55.279
It was just going to be too weird.

36:55.312 --> 36:58.348
She's devoted to you, Otto.

36:58.415 --> 37:00.183
Don't be stupid.

37:00.284 --> 37:01.285
Tell her.

37:01.285 --> 37:02.952
Tell her what?

37:03.019 --> 37:04.488
The house painter.

37:04.554 --> 37:08.658
You didn't hire him to
hit Dockery, did you?

37:13.062 --> 37:14.498
He gone?

37:15.665 --> 37:17.334
Yeah.

37:17.401 --> 37:20.337
We have to talk before Taylor comes in.

37:26.710 --> 37:28.945
He said you got a man killed.

37:29.012 --> 37:32.316
Uh, I... I don't know his name.

37:32.316 --> 37:33.750
He came in the office,

37:33.817 --> 37:37.921
and Dockery's guy
thought it was a robbery.

37:37.987 --> 37:39.556
Stuck a knife in him.

37:39.623 --> 37:41.791
Dockery took the body.

37:41.858 --> 37:44.728
What happens if somebody
comes looking for him?

37:44.794 --> 37:46.095
They won't.

37:46.162 --> 37:47.964
We can't be sure.

37:48.031 --> 37:49.032
Audrey...

37:50.900 --> 37:52.669
he was a hit man.

37:52.736 --> 37:53.870
How do you know?

37:53.937 --> 37:56.973
Because I hired him.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.008
I don't understand.

38:01.077 --> 38:02.346
Who were you going to kill?

38:02.346 --> 38:03.747
He was supposed to cut me

38:03.813 --> 38:05.515
and make it look like a robbery.

38:06.516 --> 38:07.684
To get the insurance.

38:07.751 --> 38:09.386
It's the only way I could...

38:09.453 --> 38:10.954
God damn it, Otto!

38:11.020 --> 38:12.389
That hurt!

38:16.860 --> 38:19.263
Don't you know how much I need you?

38:19.329 --> 38:20.397
I don't...

38:20.464 --> 38:21.765
[door opens]

38:21.831 --> 38:23.500
I don't think I know
that's true anymore.

38:23.567 --> 38:25.435
- [door closes]
- Nobody's saying anything.

38:25.502 --> 38:27.604
The FBI dropped a cone
of silence of the...

38:29.606 --> 38:30.907
Should I come back later?

38:30.974 --> 38:32.041
No.

38:32.108 --> 38:33.443
No.

38:34.711 --> 38:37.814
So they give you anything?

38:37.881 --> 38:40.450
There was one arrest. It wasn't Pete.

38:40.517 --> 38:41.951
So where is he?

38:44.388 --> 38:47.056
Judge dropped the case against Dockery.

38:47.123 --> 38:48.392
Oh, Jesus.

38:48.425 --> 38:49.526
No, it's all right.

38:49.593 --> 38:50.727
Audrey: It's not all right.

38:50.728 --> 38:52.630
Pete's got Dockery's money...

38:52.862 --> 38:53.863
all of it.

38:53.930 --> 38:57.133
I worked something out with Dockery.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.802
I took care of it.

38:58.868 --> 39:01.270
Took care of it how?

39:01.405 --> 39:02.972
That's not your concern.

39:04.140 --> 39:05.509
I took care of it.

39:05.575 --> 39:09.579
[truck approaching]

39:43.447 --> 39:44.881
I guess we need to talk.

39:44.948 --> 39:48.985
Before you start making
up some bullshit story,

39:49.052 --> 39:50.454
we know.

39:50.487 --> 39:52.288
You know what?

39:52.355 --> 39:53.957
We know you took Dockery's money

39:54.023 --> 39:55.224
from your grandmother

39:55.291 --> 39:58.428
to gamble in a poker room in Chinatown.

40:00.229 --> 40:02.832
Betrayed your own family.

40:02.899 --> 40:04.734
You're right.

40:07.837 --> 40:11.040
And, uh, this doesn't make it okay...

40:14.110 --> 40:16.713
but I was in hock to
some really bad people.

40:16.780 --> 40:17.814
You mean Vince?

40:17.881 --> 40:20.249
What do you know about Vince?

40:20.316 --> 40:21.718
Doesn't matter.

40:21.785 --> 40:23.820
How much did you lose?

40:25.121 --> 40:26.556
Some of it?

40:27.957 --> 40:29.092
All of it?

40:29.158 --> 40:30.894
Lose?

40:43.607 --> 40:46.075
I'm sorry it took me
so long to get back.

40:46.142 --> 40:47.143
I, uh...

40:48.578 --> 40:51.481
I just needed to tie up some loose ends.

40:54.718 --> 40:56.920

- Hi.

40:58.421 --> 41:00.624
Oh, you smell amazing.

41:02.058 --> 41:04.528
Don't you have to get the guy started?

41:04.594 --> 41:06.429
You know what?

41:06.530 --> 41:08.164
He can wait his turn.

41:08.231 --> 41:09.298
Yeah?

41:10.266 --> 41:11.635
Mm.

41:11.701 --> 41:13.537

41:13.537 --> 41:15.171
Oh, that's Amelia.

41:16.540 --> 41:17.841

41:17.907 --> 41:19.543

41:28.586 --> 41:30.087

41:30.088 --> 41:32.958
Since he got himself killed.

41:33.056 --> 41:34.658
[ring]

41:35.692 --> 41:38.261
Uh, he says "Check the Mets score."

Holy shit.

42:05.288 --> 42:07.223
Oh, God damn it, Marius.

42:08.324 --> 42:09.392
What's the matter?

42:09.458 --> 42:10.960
Nothing. I just...

42:12.395 --> 42:14.631
Oh, God damn it, Marius.

42:16.900 --> 42:18.034
What are you doing?

42:18.101 --> 42:20.303
I'm taking the money back to Dockery.

42:20.369 --> 42:21.971
I thought you worked something out.

42:22.038 --> 42:25.308
Maybe there's still
time to unring that bell.

42:26.375 --> 42:28.177
[door opens, closes]

42:28.244 --> 42:30.680
Why did you have to
lie about everything?

42:30.747 --> 42:32.849
Audrey: Why do you think?

42:34.618 --> 42:36.085
He's one of us.

42:39.288 --> 42:40.957
I guess you're right.

42:42.425 --> 42:45.695
Well, I... I guess it's
best if I just move on.

43:06.650 --> 43:09.185
Okay. I'm here.

43:13.356 --> 43:16.092
Your collateral, all of it.

43:19.128 --> 43:21.965
- Thought we had a deal.
- We did. But...

43:22.832 --> 43:23.833
there's your money.

43:23.900 --> 43:25.334
I don't need the money.

43:25.401 --> 43:27.036
I need someone to launder it.

43:27.103 --> 43:29.472
You said bail bond's a cash business,

43:29.538 --> 43:30.774
so it'll be easy.

43:33.677 --> 43:35.144

I was asleep.

44:10.013 --> 44:11.748
Right.

44:13.717 --> 44:14.984
You, uh...

44:16.119 --> 44:17.420
You asked me to trust you.

44:17.486 --> 44:19.122
I didn't.

44:19.188 --> 44:20.289
I should have.

44:20.356 --> 44:23.927
Well, I didn't really
give you any reason to.

44:32.568 --> 44:34.771
Don't wait another 20 years.

44:36.439 --> 44:37.741
I won't.

44:40.777 --> 44:43.012
And thank you for saving my life.

44:43.079 --> 44:45.749
I was going to say
the same thing to you.

45:39.402 --> 45:41.237
You're leaving.

45:41.304 --> 45:42.305
Yeah. Yeah.

45:42.371 --> 45:43.907
Lucky.

45:43.973 --> 45:46.142
I don't know about that.

45:50.814 --> 45:52.816
I'll miss you, Cousin Pete.

46:05.895 --> 46:06.963
Okay.

46:07.030 --> 46:08.397
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

Oh, wait. Y-You got a...
