No, why don't you
let "Gland Canyon"
stick up for herself?

16:51.877 --> 16:54.971
- What did Gage mean by
"you'll betray us too?"
- He's fuckin' with your head.

Why didn't you tell me
you were at the Glory Hole?

you knew Gage?

16:58.283 --> 17:01.775
- Because I didn't.
He was lying.
- Exactly.

This is precisely what that
conniving cock block
was trying to do.

17:05.022 --> 17:08.857
Get us to turn on each other.
He's a master manipulator, Hel.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.429
Besides, he told us
where the stash is.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.660
Where we hope it is.
He may have simply been
trying to buy time.

17:15.767 --> 17:17.859

19:07.713 --> 19:09.442
I thought I told you
to check his pockets.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.948
What's the big deal?
Answer it.

19:12.050 --> 19:16.282
The big deal?
With the right equipment,
anyone can ping this phone.

19:16.388 --> 19:18.652
If this is Pinky
or one of Gage's thugs,

19:18.757 --> 19:21.590
they now know he
and even we are right here.

19:21.693 --> 19:23.786
Oh, my goodness.
See?

19:23.895 --> 19:27.092
This is what happens when
you don't do as you're told.
Ring fucking ring--

19:27.199 --> 19:30.726
Fuck you, Hel.
I did check him. There was
no phone on him when we left.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.303
Well, obviously there was.

19:32.404 --> 19:34.463
You calling me a liar?
I'm calling you reckless.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.473
Stop it, both of you.

19:37.876 --> 19:40.970
What are we gonna do now?
I know
what I'm gonna do.

19:43.582 --> 19:46.949
[Scoffs]
Fuckin' relax, Hel.
That call means nothing.

19:47.052 --> 19:49.520
Just probably another
one of his slutty
slop buckets...

19:49.621 --> 19:51.646
looking to get worked
like a rented mule.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.691
We can't take that chance.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.955
We have to find what we came for
and get out of here, fast.

19:57.062 --> 20:00.657
Fine with me.
The sooner we blow this
hellhole, the better.

20:02.634 --> 20:07.298
But what about Gage?
Leave him for now.

20:07.406 --> 20:09.397
We'll bury him
when we're done.

20:12.277 --> 20:14.973
This was supposed to be easy.

20:28.059 --> 20:31.426
So, who is this Pinky person?

20:33.932 --> 20:35.524
Guys?

20:35.634 --> 20:38.626
Pinky's a notorious
underworld figure.

20:38.737 --> 20:42.764
Runs drugs, weapons,
industrial contraband,

20:42.874 --> 20:45.365
organizes hit squads,
counterfeit rings.

20:45.477 --> 20:49.743
He's rumored to have
government contracts for wet
work and supplying terror cells.

20:49.848 --> 20:53.579
Nobody deals with Pinky
directly, and nobody even knows
what he looks like.

20:53.685 --> 20:55.243
[Camero]
Many believe Pinky is a phantom.

20:55.353 --> 21:00.188
Others think he sold
his soul to the devil.
I think he is the devil.

21:00.292 --> 21:03.420
[Chuckles]
Come on.
You're just messing with me.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.257
Listen up, super ball.

21:05.363 --> 21:08.730
I've seen his victims
hanging from hooks,

21:08.834 --> 21:10.734
cut open
like slaughtered lambs,

21:10.836 --> 21:13.771
holding their guts
in their hands,
pleading for death.

21:13.872 --> 21:16.204
[Thunder Rumbles]

21:16.308 --> 21:21.439
[Camero] A few years ago, a
Russian Oligarch named Vladimir
"The Butcher" Popmeov...

21:21.546 --> 21:25.607
went after Pinky
with 50 of his best assassins.

21:25.717 --> 21:31.451
Pinky blazed through
that shit storm armed only
with a dusty old sword.

21:31.556 --> 21:37.017
When it was over, the only
thing left was a 15-foot pile
of dismembered bodies...

21:37.128 --> 21:40.461
and Popmeov's head piked up...

21:40.565 --> 21:43.932
like the twinkly star
on a Christmas tree.

21:44.035 --> 21:47.732
There ain't a mac or a blow job
on the streets that ain't
scared shitless of him.

21:47.839 --> 21:50.399
Now this guy's after us?

21:52.377 --> 21:54.345
Oh, crap.

Oh, my God, it feels so good!

Fuck you, busty.
I don't have it.

Oh, fuck.

24:20.058 --> 24:21.457
Gage.

24:26.331 --> 24:29.198
Let's get him in the trunk.
Trixie, cover up
any signs of blood.

24:30.702 --> 24:32.727
[Hel]
You got him?
Come on.

24:32.837 --> 24:34.566
Come on!

24:45.717 --> 24:48.914
This is crazy.
Let's just tell the truth
and end all this.

24:49.020 --> 24:52.217
Don't say one fucking word.
No way I'm going back
to the stocks.

24:52.323 --> 24:54.086
If I have to,
I'll take him out.

24:54.192 --> 24:57.593
No. Both of you just shut up
and let me do the talking.

[Police Radio Chatter]

25:26.324 --> 25:29.782
Ladies,
everything okay here?

25:29.894 --> 25:32.624
Boy, are we glad to see you.

25:32.731 --> 25:34.699
I, uh, saw the fence down
at the highway.

25:34.799 --> 25:36.460
You aren't supposed
to be out here.

and you'll grow a third eye.
[Chuckles]

25:41.773 --> 25:43.707
[Laughing]

25:45.810 --> 25:49.644
[Clears Throat]
How, uh-- How did you ladies
end up out here anyway?

25:51.282 --> 25:55.378
Well, Officer,
it's quite a story.

25:55.487 --> 26:00.288
See, my sisters and I
are members of
the Sacred Girls Virgin Choir...

26:00.391 --> 26:02.291
out in Sand Dab,
Arizona.

26:02.393 --> 26:05.385
We were supposed to
perform a cantata today
out in Mojave.

26:05.497 --> 26:07.226
Since we were
so far from home,

26:07.332 --> 26:11.928
the local parish director
kindly suggested that
we stay as his guests.

26:12.036 --> 26:17.338
Well, after we were all snuggled
into our one little bed
for the night,

26:17.442 --> 26:20.377
we heard loud music and
laughter coming from outside.

26:20.478 --> 26:23.504
We peeked our heads out
only to discover
the entire congregation...

26:23.615 --> 26:29.520
dancing and-and laughing
and smoking something that
may not have been tobacco.

26:29.621 --> 26:31.851
They tried to fondle
our num-nums...

26:31.956 --> 26:35.255
and even convinced Bambi Lynn
to shoot Communion wafers
out of her--

26:35.360 --> 26:39.922
Anyway, we got out
and ran to our car,
but they chased us.

26:40.031 --> 26:41.555
Well, thank the Lord
Cheyenne can drive...

26:41.666 --> 26:43.998
and Bambi Lynn can gyrate
because we lost 'em!

26:44.102 --> 26:49.165
By then, well,
it was 3:00 a.m.
and-and dark.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.174
And we were scared.

26:51.276 --> 26:54.507
And someone's not very good
with directions.

26:54.612 --> 26:57.479
And, well,
we ended up out here.

26:57.582 --> 27:02.952
And now,
if you can believe it,
our car's dead.

27:08.593 --> 27:11.585
I see.
We tried to jump her,

27:11.696 --> 27:15.427
but we just couldn't
get her off.

27:15.533 --> 27:19.594
That's why we're
all dirty and desperate.

27:19.704 --> 27:24.403
You must think
the worst of us.
No. [Laughs] Don't be silly.

27:24.509 --> 27:26.477
I already
called the tow company,

27:26.578 --> 27:29.809
and they're
on their way, Deputy...

27:29.914 --> 27:31.882
Fucks.

27:33.852 --> 27:37.754
Fuchs. It's, uh--
[Clears Throat] Fuchs, ma'am.

27:37.856 --> 27:39.619
Oh.
[Giggles]
Oops.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.060
You know,
let me take a look at her.

27:44.162 --> 27:46.392
Sometimes you just got
to know how to finger
these old beauties.

27:46.497 --> 27:50.729
- That won't be necessary.
- Why not?

27:50.835 --> 27:52.894
What happened to your hand?

27:57.575 --> 28:01.170
- Cut it on my crucifix.
- You know what?

28:01.279 --> 28:05.807
The towing company already
made us post a $200 deposit
for coming out here.

28:05.917 --> 28:07.908
Said they'd arrive by noon.

28:08.019 --> 28:11.079
Maybe I can save you
that money. Hmm?

28:21.966 --> 28:25.527
Oh. Yeah, they
don't make 'em
like this anymore.

28:25.637 --> 28:29.004
Nowadays, it's all
computers and sensors.

turn the key, please.

28:59.304 --> 29:01.795
See? Nothing.

29:01.906 --> 29:04.841
That's odd. It, uh,
must be the starter.

29:27.598 --> 29:30.533
You know what?
[Sighs]

29:30.635 --> 29:34.002
Sometimes these old cars
have tool kits
along with the jacks.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.834
You can't!

29:37.642 --> 29:39.007
You can't!

29:40.645 --> 29:43.273
Why not?
Be-Because--

29:43.381 --> 29:45.542
Because the trunk lock
is rusted out.

29:45.650 --> 29:48.244
Hasn't opened in years.

29:53.624 --> 29:57.060
- You okay, miss?
- She'll be fine.

29:57.161 --> 29:59.129
She's still upset
about last night.

29:59.230 --> 30:01.198
Those choirboys
tried to defile her.

30:03.534 --> 30:07.061
Listen, you've been
so helpful and kind.

30:07.171 --> 30:09.605
The least I can do is come
back here and cook for you.

30:09.707 --> 30:12.437
Say, dinner Friday?

30:12.543 --> 30:15.068
It's a--
[Clears Throat]

30:17.081 --> 30:22.485
It's a tempting offer, but,
uh, I'll, uh, tell you what.

30:22.587 --> 30:25.920
I'll-I'll swing back around
later, make sure, uh,
you ladies got away safely.

have to kill me too.

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:04.477

Just-- Just go to the car!

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:08.778
[Yells]

01:13:15.757 --> 01:13:17.622
Time to get medieval.

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.655
Camero, ease up.

01:13:21.763 --> 01:13:25.563
We have the diamonds.
Okay? The plan worked.

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:28.659
- All we have to do
is drive away, and we've won.
- Bullshit.

01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:30.897
I trusted you before.
Look where that got me.

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:34.305
Goddamn it, Camero!
I'm not gonna let you
fuck this up now!

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:36.309
Drop that chain and get
your head on straight.

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:39.539
Time to test your loyalty
and see what you're
really made of.

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:44.711
A wet-job, Polly punanni,
and all is forgiven,
whoever you are.

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:49.020
Come on.
You and me started this.

01:13:49.124 --> 01:13:51.422
You and me should finish it.
[Hel]
No.

01:13:51.526 --> 01:13:53.926
- We're in this together.
- Fine.

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:57.226
Then I'm gonna sleigh-ride
your sorry ass once and for all.

You're next,

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:34.686
Stay down, Camero.
I don't wanna have to kill you.

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:52.001
How do you like it, bitch?

01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:54.575
Did you really think
you could beat me, huh?

01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:16.728

Get this fucking going!

I don't care anymore.

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:14.163
It's all a lie,

Yes.

01:20:24.185 --> 01:20:26.619

No.

01:20:56.885 --> 01:20:58.477

[Deiter Groans, Coughs]
The specs! Now!

01:21:12.867 --> 01:21:14.835
You've got
the wrong überman.

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:17.928
I know nothing of
this murderous plague
you speak of.

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:20.098

Congratulations,
Foxy 69.

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:37.491
Mission accomplished,
Phoenix.
I have the antitoxin data.

01:21:37.592 --> 01:21:40.823
I have another assignment
that demands
your immediate attention.

01:21:40.929 --> 01:21:44.797
As you know,
the Glory Hole was
a regrettable miscalculation.

01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:47.732
But tac-comm has learned
of another opportunity
to retrieve the nano-swarm.

01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:53.707
I'm sending you
to Honey Junction
Women's Prison...

01:21:53.808 --> 01:21:56.470
to infiltrate and make contact
with a former colleague
of Mortimer Gage.

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.546
She goes by an alias,
Camero.

01:21:58.646 --> 01:22:00.671
I'm on it.

01:22:00.782 --> 01:22:04.582
Good. Now, bury all evidence
and get yourself home.

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:07.018

01:22:27.408 --> 01:22:29.376
Oh, my God.

01:22:30.678 --> 01:22:32.839
You're a wicked-cool
covert operative...

01:22:32.947 --> 01:22:35.814
masquerading
as a sex-toy tycoon?

01:22:37.018 --> 01:22:38.576
Mm-hmm.

01:22:40.522 --> 01:22:43.514
My mission
was to reclaim that--

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.559
a weaponized vial
of synthetic nano-swarm...

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:48.390
that Gage hijacked
from a C.I.A. convoy.

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:51.590
It's filled with trillions
of self-replicating
robo-viruses...

01:22:51.699 --> 01:22:55.135
that latch on to
any living organism
and suck the carbon out...

01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:59.764
till you, me,
even the cockroaches are
nothing more than gray goo.

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:03.275
It could wipe out
an entire continent
if properly deployed.

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:05.903
I had to extricate it
before Gage tried, again,

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:09.415
to sell it to another
combatant country
or crazed libertarian.

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:14.386
So the plan,
the diamonds, us...

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:17.117
was all just a crock?

01:23:17.225 --> 01:23:21.252
No. Not us, Trix.

01:23:21.362 --> 01:23:25.162
What I am doesn't change
how I feel about you.

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:27.234
Everything
between us is real.

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:32.268
You've changed me.

01:23:33.608 --> 01:23:36.168
Made me see a life
I've been missing.

01:23:37.478 --> 01:23:41.972
Craving really.

I'm through
being Foxy 69.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:48.621
But you can't
just walk away
from Flesh Force Foxy...

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:50.691
with a wink
and a hi-dee-ho.

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:53.352
I needed leverage
and a huge bankroll.

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:56.021
The vial
and the diamonds
give us both.

01:23:57.832 --> 01:24:03.771
Now you, Lily and me
can slip off to a small
Micronesian island together...

01:24:03.871 --> 01:24:06.203
forever.

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.939
And playfully wrestle
in the surf?

doesn't it? Having
someone you love taken away.

It wasn't her fault,

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:06.566

I'll tell you.
Human nature.

Early Christianity
tells us of humanity's
seven deadly sins.

gluttony, greed, sloth,

are human sins...

Always has... or did.

01:40:31.539 --> 01:40:33.439
He got careless.

01:40:33.541 --> 01:40:36.169
I guess we know
where that ended up.

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.446
So this whole thing--

01:40:41.549 --> 01:40:44.416
my mission, us meeting,

01:40:44.519 --> 01:40:46.419
Camero--

01:40:50.725 --> 01:40:52.693
It was all for this.

01:40:54.162 --> 01:40:58.622
Made in the 16th century
by Master Craftsman
Umatada Mjouji.

01:40:58.733 --> 01:41:03.295
This naginata
has seen battles won
and empires fall...

01:41:03.404 --> 01:41:05.304
for over 600 years.

01:41:05.406 --> 01:41:08.534
It's the one thing I love
on this godforsaken Earth.

01:41:08.643 --> 01:41:11.976
And Gage was stupid enough
to think I didn't care.

01:41:14.015 --> 01:41:16.245
How could you do this?

01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:19.808
Play the victim?
I loved you.

01:41:19.921 --> 01:41:22.481
A girl's got to get
her jollies somehow.

01:41:22.590 --> 01:41:24.854
Oh.

01:41:24.959 --> 01:41:27.894
And I really get off
watching girls fight.

01:41:29.731 --> 01:41:33.258
- You guys were awesome.
- What are you waiting for?

01:41:33.367 --> 01:41:36.666
Go on.
Finish your sick little game.

01:41:39.707 --> 01:41:42.642
We read we ought
to forgive our enemies,

01:41:42.744 --> 01:41:46.202
but we do not read--
That we should
forgive our friends.

01:41:46.314 --> 01:41:50.546
Cosimo de' Medici, 1454.

01:41:54.722 --> 01:41:57.088
[Blows]

01:41:58.126 --> 01:41:59.821
Go to hell, Trixie!

01:42:03.197 --> 01:42:05.188
Last one in's
a rotten egg.

01:42:05.299 --> 01:42:08.097
[Echoing]
Last one in's a rotten egg.

01:42:16.944 --> 01:42:21.108
[Engine Revving]

01:42:28.656 --> 01:42:31.591
[Woman Narrating]
"All warfare is based
on deception.

01:42:31.692 --> 01:42:34.991
"Hence, when able to attack,
we must seem unable.

01:42:35.096 --> 01:42:38.554
"When using our forces,
we must seem inactive.

01:42:38.666 --> 01:42:42.432
"When we are near,
we must make the enemy
believe we are far away.

01:42:42.537 --> 01:42:45.973
"When far away, we must
make him believe we are near.

01:42:46.073 --> 01:42:49.133
"Hold out baits
to entice the enemy.

01:42:49.243 --> 01:42:53.111
Feign disorder and crush him."

01:42:53.214 --> 01:42:58.208
