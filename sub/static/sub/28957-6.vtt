ANNOUNCER: FX presents Snowfall.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.676
LORENA:
I quit the Agency
and I joined Reed.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.044
So I'm your contact now.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.246
Get used to it.

00:14.715 --> 00:15.949
The DEA's gonna be
looking for her.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.385
MARIELA:
Make sure

00:17.418 --> 00:19.387
they never find her. That's it.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.722
-What do you want, Gustavo?
-GUSTAVO: Business...

00:25.626 --> 00:27.061
Cocaine never dropped,

00:27.095 --> 00:28.529
-amigo.
-TEDDY: Let me check

00:28.562 --> 00:30.298
with the Colombians.
I'll get back to you.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.333
My people in Mexico
have been waiting.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.934
It was supposed
to arrive two days ago.

00:33.967 --> 00:34.902
I'll resume the drops

00:34.935 --> 00:38.072
when you get me my fucking club.

00:38.106 --> 00:41.109
TEDDY:
I know that I said I didn't want
you to meet with the Colombians,

00:41.142 --> 00:43.411
but what do you know
about nightclubs?

00:43.444 --> 00:44.645
You know your daddy
and the rest of them pigs

00:44.678 --> 00:45.646
snatched up my cousin.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.014
Hey, I'm talking to you.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.718
-EVA: Shon-Shon.
-(overlapping arguing)

00:50.751 --> 00:53.020
ANDRE:
The only thing
that makes sense is that

00:53.053 --> 00:54.422
she drugged me.

00:57.258 --> 01:00.027
I need you to do something
for me, Nix.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.163
I'm gonna bury Franklin Saint.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.897
About fucking time.

01:03.931 --> 01:06.934
I'm-a need you to find out
where he lays his head.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.939
(insects chirping, dog barking)

01:13.174 --> 01:15.176
(Alton exhales)

01:16.610 --> 01:18.446
Smells good.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.749
Sorry.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.751
No, don't put it out
on my account.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.719
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.189
Are you?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.097
(grunts)

01:41.969 --> 01:45.973
There's something I need
to tell you about Franklin.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.724
("C.O.D. (I'll Deliver)"
by Mtume playing)

02:04.958 --> 02:06.727
* Hey, boy *

02:06.760 --> 02:10.431
* I know it's what you wanted *

02:10.464 --> 02:12.833
* Closer to me *

02:12.866 --> 02:15.102
(music playing over headphones)

02:15.135 --> 02:16.637
* Sweet thing... *

02:16.670 --> 02:18.272
Hey.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.674
* I know just how to flaunt it *

02:20.708 --> 02:23.110
* Can't you see? *

02:23.143 --> 02:25.579
* I'll deliver... *

02:25.613 --> 02:28.216
Morning.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.618
How you feeling? Any better?

02:33.153 --> 02:34.822
A little.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.991
You look better.
(chuckles)

02:41.695 --> 02:43.664
Hey, um...

02:43.697 --> 02:45.799
How much longer
are you gonna be like this?

02:45.833 --> 02:48.168
Like what?

02:48.202 --> 02:50.604
Sitting around,
feeling sorry for yourself.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.142
Okay. I'm done asking.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.611
-Let's go.
-What are you doing?

02:57.645 --> 02:59.146
Getting you packed up,
taking you to school.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.215
-You're gonna make me go?
-That's right. Get up.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.183
Daddy, I told you I'm not going
looking like this.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.185
They gonna see my face
and think I'm some hood rat.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.521
Well, then let's take
a road trip. Okay, baby?

03:07.555 --> 03:09.623
And by the time we get there,
you'll look better.

03:09.657 --> 03:12.125
-No I won't.
-Then why won't you tell me
what happened?

03:12.159 --> 03:13.794
Because you'll just
make it worse.

03:13.827 --> 03:18.999
So you gonna blame me,
and you won't even be honest?

03:19.032 --> 03:21.034
(scoffs)
Like you've been honest with me.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.705
Either you're gonna get up,
pack your bags,

03:24.738 --> 03:28.576
and get ready to leave,
or I'm gonna pull that money,

03:28.609 --> 03:30.811
and you can call
Spelman yourself

03:30.844 --> 03:33.347
and tell 'em you ain't coming.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.783
Fine.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.218
That's what I'll do.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.369
Hey.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.772
What's up? Y'all paged me.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.942
You were young, but, um...

04:01.975 --> 04:05.045
how much do you remember
about my cousin Jack?

04:07.147 --> 04:08.949
FRANKLIN:
Jack?

04:08.982 --> 04:11.585
I remember y'all both
moved west together,

04:11.619 --> 04:14.722
joined the Panthers together,
he got killed by the police.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.657
The FBI, but, yeah.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.092
I also remember you was around
less and less after that.

04:19.126 --> 04:22.796
What I never told you
was why he was murdered.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.568
He was an informant.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.538
Jack was a snitch? But you, you
told me he'd been gunned down,

04:30.571 --> 04:32.606
that he'd been done wrong.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.308
And he had.

04:35.943 --> 04:40.848
He had been funneling
information to them for months.

04:40.881 --> 04:44.685
And they must have felt
like he outlived his usefulness.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.957
And when they decided that,
they killed him.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.828
I'm telling you this now
because your mom told me

04:54.862 --> 04:57.297
about your relationship
with Reed Thompson.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.832
FRANKLIN:
Okay.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.668
This ain't the same thing.

05:00.701 --> 05:04.505
FBI, they was, they was trying
to destroy the movement.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.507
I mean, Reed Thompson,
he needs me.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.543
Mm-hmm. Got you out of prison,
he needed you so bad.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.144
But what happens
when he doesn't?

05:11.178 --> 05:14.715
Listen, I got people coming
at me every day, Alton.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.917
He just another motherfucker
that need to be dealt with.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.352
No, he ain't.

05:20.153 --> 05:24.492
A gangster, you'll spot him
coming at you a mile away.

05:24.525 --> 05:29.162
But if this man is United States
government, he will destroy you

05:29.196 --> 05:33.200
and everything you know, and
you will never see him coming.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.917
(train horn blowing)

06:15.843 --> 06:17.578
Está bien.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.838
("Hard Times" by The Jetzons
playing)

07:50.871 --> 07:55.075
* Memories that continue
to amaze me... *

07:55.108 --> 07:57.778
The place you wanted, Helena's,

07:57.811 --> 07:59.947
is on the way out.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.449
This is the new hot spot.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.918
We can always change the name,
if you want to.

08:04.952 --> 08:09.156
My advice would be not
to fuck with what works.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.592
-Is that, um...?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.127
That's the kid
from Risky Business. Be cool.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.463
How you do this?

08:16.496 --> 08:20.167
How do you get anything
you want with no hassle?

08:20.200 --> 08:25.405
Easy. Put the fucking gun on
their head and ask them to sign.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.049
TEDDY:
We overpaid, in cash.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.819
And part of me wants to say
that you owe me half.

08:38.852 --> 08:42.455
That's about $700,000.

08:42.489 --> 08:46.293
But, because I believe so deeply
in our personal connection

08:46.326 --> 08:49.897
and our business relationship,
this is on me.

08:49.930 --> 08:54.167
You think we can get
Harrison Fords to come?

08:54.201 --> 08:57.004
-I hear he likes Thursdays.
-Really?

08:57.037 --> 09:00.473
Oh, come-- come on, give me
a fucking hug, man, come on.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.143
I don't know what to say.

09:03.176 --> 09:06.013
Say you'll resume the drops.

09:10.017 --> 09:14.387

09:36.610 --> 09:39.579

09:42.783 --> 09:45.018
* And I can't get enough... *

09:45.052 --> 09:48.756
I thought I might go over
and say hi to the Cruise kid.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.191
-Oh, really?
-Mm-hmm.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.193
I've been at home playing blocks
with a toddler

09:53.226 --> 09:54.795

again... *

10:01.902 --> 10:04.404
I need this.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.877
* Ooh, I feel so good
about us... *

10:09.910 --> 10:11.779

how to cover his tracks.

has his mom's house

10:16.183 --> 10:18.218
listed as his primary address.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.220
Car registration, same thing.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.055
I tried to poke around in the
family's real estate business,

10:22.089 --> 10:23.957
but all their holdings
are hidden

10:23.991 --> 10:26.426
in some shell corporation that's
registered out of the country.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.461
-Jesus.
-Yeah.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.964
So, I could stake out
his mom's place,

10:30.998 --> 10:34.267
follow him from there, but a
white guy just sitting in a car,

10:34.301 --> 10:36.970
-that neighborhood is...
-Yeah, yeah, don't do that.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.972
Let me think on it a beat.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.407
Thanks for trying.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.276
No problem.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.145
How you holding up?

10:48.682 --> 10:51.118
Kitten said she ain't run.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.086
Tried to fight head up.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.722
But you already know
how they do.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.123
Jumped her and Eva.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.692
I tried to call her up,
see if she okay.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.628
Andre got her
on some serious lockdown.

11:01.661 --> 11:05.132
Eva says she was touched up
a bit, but she'll be all right.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.167
Mm.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.971
How many inside?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.774
At least three,
but they all gonna be strapped.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.375
Who we aiming at?

11:15.408 --> 11:17.377
Just be ready to shoot
every motherfucker in there

11:17.410 --> 11:18.611
if need be.

Come on.

playing)

11:28.155 --> 11:30.557
Hey, Franklin!

11:32.659 --> 11:34.361
Wish you'd told me
you were coming.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.864
And bringing friends.
I'd prepare something for you.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.531
Nah, that would've ruined
the surprise.

How about some Arnold Palmers?

11:44.304 --> 11:46.006
You been watching the games?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.575
Yesterday night, I saw a guy...

11:48.608 --> 11:50.911
looked just like you.

11:50.944 --> 11:55.182
He ran so fast... (chuckling):
I called him Black Lightning!

11:55.215 --> 11:57.117

11:57.150 --> 11:59.519
my people beat your people
in all types of sports,

11:59.552 --> 12:01.621
I'm here to talk about business.

12:01.654 --> 12:05.859
I know I owe you. And, uh,
like I told you on the phone,

12:05.893 --> 12:08.728
a couple weeks,

12:08.762 --> 12:11.664
once the next shipment
goes through,

12:11.698 --> 12:13.967
I'll get paid and so will you.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.904
That weren't the deal.

12:16.937 --> 12:21.041
Ever heard the expression, you
can't get blood from a stone?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.043
Yeah, but I can get some
from you, though.

12:27.147 --> 12:30.383
You seem to think I'm that same
kid that came here looking

12:30.417 --> 12:32.552
for a few grams of coke.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.522
You seem to have forgotten
what I did for you that day.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.090
No, I haven't.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.059
And that's the only reason why
I'm gonna give you

12:39.092 --> 12:41.094

12:57.244 --> 13:00.780
I want to know everything
you can find.

13:00.814 --> 13:04.117
Who he works for.
His real name.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.986
You get me that in 48 hours,

13:06.019 --> 13:07.654
you've bought yourself
some time.

13:07.687 --> 13:10.257
You could've asked me that

13:10.290 --> 13:12.692
with your gun
still in your waist.

13:12.725 --> 13:17.064
For some reason I didn't think
you'd hear me unless I did.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.067
I'll see what I can do.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.769
A'ight. Tell your men
to be cool.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.874

14:00.908 --> 14:04.144
Want to join me for sex?

14:04.177 --> 14:05.645
(chuckles)

14:05.678 --> 14:07.647
Have you ever heard
the expression...

14:07.680 --> 14:09.716
"Don't shit where you eat"?

14:09.749 --> 14:12.986
Oh... that's too bad.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.788
You know how to have
a good time.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.058
Not like that DEA puta.

14:19.559 --> 14:23.230
But if it makes you
feel better...

14:23.263 --> 14:25.532
"Reeds" can watch.

14:25.565 --> 14:29.669
* All right, baby... *

14:29.702 --> 14:32.039
Change your mind, muñeca...

14:34.174 --> 14:36.009
...find me.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.178
-* Oh, oh *
-* Baby *

14:38.211 --> 14:41.681
*

14:42.916 --> 14:45.485
* You bring out the best in me *

14:45.518 --> 14:47.754
* Baby... *

14:48.755 --> 14:50.357
Rigo being Rigo?

14:50.390 --> 14:53.726
Mm. He said you could watch.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.662
I'm game if you are.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.164
(chuckles)

14:59.766 --> 15:02.735
*

15:10.210 --> 15:12.279
Want to get out of here?

15:14.047 --> 15:16.349
Don't we own this place?

15:17.985 --> 15:20.753
*

15:26.059 --> 15:28.795
(Julia panting)

15:44.811 --> 15:47.080
* Here for 100 years *

15:47.114 --> 15:50.417
* With chains
on your soul, huh *

15:50.450 --> 15:53.586
* 200 years,
they traded you for gold... *

15:53.620 --> 15:55.588
(laughs):
Well, goodness.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.424
Franklin Saint.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.326
-Ah. Ah.
-(Franklin laughs)

15:59.359 --> 16:01.461
-How you doing, Mrs. M?
-Maintainin'. You?

16:01.494 --> 16:02.895
Same. Same.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.564
How's Alton?
Him and your mom doing okay?

16:04.597 --> 16:05.999
Ah, they're great.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.868
We're all glad
he's getting back to himself.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.937
We could use
a few more like him.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.673
* I said something got
to be done... *

16:13.706 --> 16:15.708
So...

16:15.742 --> 16:17.944
you finally ready
to learn something?

16:17.977 --> 16:20.080
* Ain't... *

16:20.113 --> 16:22.582
* Gonna wait too long, no *

16:22.615 --> 16:24.317
* Hey, Lord, yeah *

16:24.351 --> 16:25.485
* Hey, Lord... *

16:25.518 --> 16:26.953
MRS. MOSLEY:
Franklin?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.089
* Hey, Lord, wait too long *

16:29.122 --> 16:30.257
* Hey, Lord *

16:30.290 --> 16:32.259
* I can't wait another *

16:32.292 --> 16:33.626
* 400 years, no... *

16:33.660 --> 16:36.429
-You know me too well.
-(laughs)

16:36.463 --> 16:38.765
* I can't wait,
I can't wait... *

16:38.798 --> 16:40.967
One of my faves.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.803
The Spook Who Sat by the Door.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.539
This is the story of a man
who was isolated,

16:46.573 --> 16:49.409
manipulated, and weaponized
by the CIA.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.144
What are these?

16:51.178 --> 16:53.280
Church hearings, 1975.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.249
Transcripts of an investigation

16:56.283 --> 16:58.151
into the CIA and the FBI.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.986
Word has it

17:00.019 --> 17:01.988
they spied on King
and infiltrated

17:02.021 --> 17:04.757
many of our black groups
to breed dissent.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.326
Black Panthers.
Freedom fighters.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.794
Even choirs.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.496
When black folks organize,

17:09.529 --> 17:11.531
(laughs): scares the hell
out of the American government.

17:11.564 --> 17:12.799
Yeah, I'll bet.

17:12.832 --> 17:16.369
Tell the boy the most
important part about that there.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.205
How they had a way to kill us

17:18.238 --> 17:19.639
without any detection.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.441
Called it the "ice gun."

17:21.474 --> 17:24.677
Mm-hmm. They could shoot us,
and we wouldn't even know.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.847
Only left a little red dot,
just like a bug bite,

17:27.880 --> 17:29.482
and then a couple of days later,

17:29.516 --> 17:31.484
boom, you fall dead
from a heart attack.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.321
This young man does not need to
hear your conspiracy theories.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.888
Let's go get you some cake.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.391
Next time lead with cake, woman.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.160
* I can't, I can't,
I can't, I can't *

17:40.193 --> 17:41.994
* I can't wait, brother,
I can't wait, brother *

17:42.028 --> 17:44.063
* I can't wait, I can't wait *

17:44.097 --> 17:46.133
* I can't wait another *

17:46.166 --> 17:48.201
* 400 years, no *

17:48.235 --> 17:50.170
* I can't wait, brother,
I can't wait *

17:50.203 --> 17:52.239
* I can't wait, I can't wait *

17:52.272 --> 17:54.407
* Brother can't wait,
Papa can't wait *

17:54.441 --> 17:56.376
* Sister can't wait,
I can't wait *

17:56.409 --> 17:58.311
* I can't wait, I can't wait *

17:58.345 --> 18:00.580
* I can't wait,
I can't wait *

18:00.613 --> 18:03.049
* I can't, I can't,
I can't, I can't *

18:03.082 --> 18:06.419
* I can't, I can't, I can't,
I can't, I can't, I can't. *

18:10.690 --> 18:13.025
Tony Marino?

18:13.059 --> 18:15.061
Can I see some I.D.?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.730
Uh, we don't carry
that kind of I.D. around.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.732
-I'm sure you understand.
-Yeah.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.234
Then you can be anybody,

18:21.268 --> 18:24.036
and I don't really have
to talk to you.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.573
I'm sure you understand.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.776
Can I call you Tony?

18:29.809 --> 18:30.810
No.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.480
Mr. Marino...

18:33.513 --> 18:35.748
Agent Marino.

18:37.083 --> 18:40.086
Look... I understand.
You're frustrated.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.888
Frustrated?

18:41.921 --> 18:45.592
An agent I've known for years
goes missing, is probably dead,

18:45.625 --> 18:48.428
and some mystery woman
who claims to be CIA

18:48.461 --> 18:50.763
is looking into it.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.065
I'm baffled, is what I am.

18:53.099 --> 18:56.102
What makes you think she's dead?

19:03.009 --> 19:05.144
She missed her check-ins.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.914
Her place made
to look like she ran,

19:07.947 --> 19:10.283
which I know she would never.

19:12.185 --> 19:15.688
The last time we talked,
she mentioned being exposed.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.060
-Can you tell me when was the...
-No.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.996
You tell me something.

19:24.030 --> 19:27.467
Who exactly is Teddy McDonald?

19:29.135 --> 19:31.103
I don't know. Why?

19:31.137 --> 19:33.740
He was the guy
she was working for.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.575
The alleged Fed...

19:35.608 --> 19:38.044
who recruited her told her
she'd be accumulating evidence

19:38.077 --> 19:40.513
against the Medellín Cartel.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.951
(clears throat softly)

19:44.984 --> 19:47.954
Did you ever meet this man?

19:47.987 --> 19:50.089
Did your agent have...

19:50.122 --> 19:52.525
any other information about him?

19:52.559 --> 19:54.126
Never met him.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.996
Only know he's CIA,
or claimed to be.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.234
Are you gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?

20:01.268 --> 20:03.336
Unfortunately, I'm not allowed

20:03.370 --> 20:06.439
-to go into any specifics.
-(chuckles) Yeah, course not.

20:11.278 --> 20:14.013
Look...

20:14.046 --> 20:16.182
I got no support at the DEA.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.151
They're convinced
Lorena got turned.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.988
It happens.
But I know it didn't.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.491
I think she's dead.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.893
And this guy McDonald's
involved.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.562
He's the guy you need
to be talking to.

20:29.596 --> 20:32.198
He also went under an alias.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.066
Reed Thompson.

20:35.768 --> 20:39.539
Track him down, you'll find out
what happened to my agent.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.008
Agent Marino...

20:42.041 --> 20:44.143
Do your fucking job.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.915
Call me when you do.

20:57.223 --> 20:59.726
-Don't worry, he ain't here.
-Thank God.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.794
I'm starving.
Y'all got fries?

21:07.734 --> 21:09.536
(sighs)

21:12.905 --> 21:16.075
Leon kept begging me
to sneak out last night.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.745
I was like,
"Nigga, you ain't slick."

21:18.778 --> 21:20.847
Just trying to get some.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.916
Hey, Shon-Shon
been sweating you?

21:23.950 --> 21:26.886
Last time I saw her,
she had the nerve to speak.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.622
But I ain't worried about her,
and you shouldn't either.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.559
I was just...
making sure you was good.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.627
I'll be better

21:34.661 --> 21:36.963
when I get them clothes
you can't take with you.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.865
Make all them bitches jealous.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.267
(Eva giggles)

21:41.300 --> 21:44.236
I don't even know
if I want to go now.

21:44.270 --> 21:47.006
And my dad has been sweating me.

21:47.039 --> 21:50.176
Talking about...
he ain't gonna pay,

21:50.209 --> 21:51.878
when, shit,
it's my college fund.

21:51.911 --> 21:55.147
Wish I had a daddy
who'd saved up for my college.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.583
You act like
I ain't got no problems.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.551
Ain't saying that.

21:58.585 --> 22:00.687
But, damn...

22:00.720 --> 22:02.789
I'd trade places with you
in a minute.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.558
I want to go away to school,
live in a new place,

22:05.592 --> 22:08.327
study what I want instead
of having to get a shitty job.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.998
I love you.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.601
I mean, you're my best friend.

22:14.634 --> 22:17.604
I don't know what I'm-a do
when you gone.

22:19.305 --> 22:21.307
But go to school, ho.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.549
A'ight.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.154
So, uh...

22:35.187 --> 22:37.490
should we make
some Kool-Aid, too?

22:37.524 --> 22:39.325
Red or grape?

22:39.358 --> 22:41.428
BOTH:
Red!

22:41.461 --> 22:42.962
Always red.
(laughs)

22:42.995 --> 22:44.997
Okay, let's get some more fries.

22:45.031 --> 22:48.100
* We rock, and don't stop,
well, it's the *

22:48.134 --> 22:49.802
* Supercalifragilistic-
expialidocious *

22:49.836 --> 22:51.838
* With no strings attached,
no bags of tricks, this is *

22:51.871 --> 22:53.473
* The way we get our kicks,
we're qualifying, rectifying *

22:53.506 --> 22:55.174
* Rock until the day we're
dying, every time you're *

22:55.207 --> 22:57.176
* Screaming, crying,
we'll be here with no denying *

22:57.209 --> 22:59.045
* We hold our honor and
our pride, just take a step *

22:59.078 --> 23:01.113
* And kept in stride, we
set down rules you will abide *

23:01.147 --> 23:02.815
* We're gonna take you for
a ride, before we're rockin' *

23:02.849 --> 23:04.784
* As a full, let's
introduce us one by one... *

23:04.817 --> 23:06.419
Are you hungry?

23:06.453 --> 23:08.020
* L.A. Sunshine,
I rock your mind... *

23:08.054 --> 23:11.290
We've exchanged $25 million
worth of product.

23:11.323 --> 23:14.393
Ain't it about time
we had a meal together?

23:14.427 --> 23:16.362
* Nobody rock the mic
like me... *

23:16.395 --> 23:18.798
Right now?
With a trunk full of cocaine?

23:18.831 --> 23:22.101
There's a diner cops love
about a mile away.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.871
Figure hungry cops ain't worried
about anything but eating.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.039
-Yeah, I don't think
that's right.
-Come on.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.241
It'll be fun.

23:29.275 --> 23:32.512
* Because we rock non-stop,
because we rock non-stop *

23:32.545 --> 23:34.914
* Because we rock
non-stop *

23:34.947 --> 23:37.283
* Because we rock non-stop *

23:37.316 --> 23:39.151
* Easy Lee is gonna rock
non-stop... *

23:39.185 --> 23:40.720
See, my pops, man,
he was impressed

23:40.753 --> 23:42.321
with Benjamin Franklin,
you know.

23:42.354 --> 23:44.423
Inventor, revolutionist, author.

23:44.457 --> 23:46.693
Like all the things
he wanted you to be?

23:46.726 --> 23:49.929
What he regrets he'll never be.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.865
My dad named me after his uncle.

23:52.899 --> 23:55.668
He was this... real guy's guy.

23:55.702 --> 23:59.305
Army ranger, real-life war hero.

23:59.338 --> 24:01.608
Expectations didn't really
get any lower from there.

24:01.641 --> 24:04.944
Damn. That's a lot of pressure
to be a success.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.246
America loves a winner.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.616
Yeah. But what if America

24:09.649 --> 24:11.350
really was the land
of the free, though?

24:11.383 --> 24:13.252
You know, free everything.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.155
Land, money, thought,
opportunity.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.990
How would we measure success?

24:18.024 --> 24:19.859
America is the land of the free.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.994
You know? There's people
fighting to make sure

24:22.028 --> 24:23.462
of that right this minute.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.868
You don't agree?

24:28.901 --> 24:31.504
White folks are fighting to keep
what they got to get even more,

24:31.538 --> 24:34.406
and black folks
are fighting to survive.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.843
And America don't give a fuck
whether we make it or not.

24:36.876 --> 24:39.045
Yeah, obviously,
your people got a raw deal.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.747
I'm not saying that.
What I'm saying is that

24:40.780 --> 24:42.515
just because
the playing field isn't level,

24:42.549 --> 24:44.150
it doesn't mean you don't
have every opportunity.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.586
-You really believe that?
-Yes, I do.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.721
-It's what makes America great.
-(chuckles)

24:48.755 --> 24:52.291
See, what you don't realize,
Reed, is there's two Americas,

24:52.324 --> 24:54.961
and we don't live
in the same one.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.029
But you know what's interesting
about that?

24:57.063 --> 24:59.599
That despite that, somehow,

24:59.632 --> 25:01.868
the two of us
still ended up doing dirt.

25:01.901 --> 25:04.270
I mean, I know why I'm doing it.

25:04.303 --> 25:07.339
What I don't understand is,
why are you?

25:08.374 --> 25:11.343
Maybe I take the money
and do good.

25:11.377 --> 25:12.745
(laughs)

25:12.779 --> 25:15.815
Some kind of yay-slinging
Robin Hood, huh?

25:15.848 --> 25:17.116
-Maybe.
-(chuckles)

25:17.149 --> 25:19.018
So, who are you helping, Reed?

25:19.051 --> 25:21.320
The white man keep his place
on the throne?

25:21.353 --> 25:24.523
Or am I part of some fucked-up
community outreach program

25:24.557 --> 25:27.326
-for disadvantaged kids
in the hood? Huh?
-(pager beeping)

25:27.359 --> 25:28.861
Oh.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.396
I'll wait.

25:30.429 --> 25:32.632
Mm-hmm.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.047
It's me.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.751
What time?

26:00.627 --> 26:02.862
Got to get going.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.496
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

26:04.530 --> 26:05.865
No, I-I got the check.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.233
Oh, thanks, man.

26:07.266 --> 26:10.169
Thank you.

26:10.202 --> 26:13.239
-Glad we did this.
-Yeah, man. Me, too.

26:23.549 --> 26:25.484
Junior think
his shit rocking.

26:25.517 --> 26:27.086
Wait till he hear my shit.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.721
His ain't gonna be half as nice
when we get done.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.222
(chuckles)
That's what I'm talking about.

26:30.256 --> 26:33.225
-Finally getting
that upgrade, huh?
-Yeah.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.694
Bass about to be harder
than your heartbeat.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.729
(chuckles) Where's he at?

26:39.465 --> 26:40.700
Damn.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.402
Hey, I didn't want to ask you

26:43.435 --> 26:45.071
in front of everybody,

26:45.104 --> 26:47.506
but I heard you asking Avi
about the connect.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.341
What's up with that?

26:49.375 --> 26:51.944
Think he might work
for some big people.

26:51.978 --> 26:54.046
-Colombians?
-Nah, not sure.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.649
I'll let you know
if I find out, though. Promise.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.951
-Unk.
-JEROME: Nephew.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.687
-You straight?
-Yeah, I'm good.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.689
The hell you got them
so far in the back for?

27:02.722 --> 27:04.223
-Shit gonna be muffled.
-LEON: I just want

27:04.256 --> 27:06.458
whatever gonna make the people
feel me when I ride by.

27:06.492 --> 27:07.660
Didn't want to take up
his whole trunk.

27:07.694 --> 27:09.628
You ain't got to.
You just pull them forward.

27:09.662 --> 27:10.629
They ain't gonna fit, boss.

27:10.663 --> 27:12.464
Why are you questioning me, huh?

27:12.498 --> 27:13.766
It is gon' fit.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.201
You don't know how to do it.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.804
You pull them forward, you
turn them around. What it say?

27:17.837 --> 27:19.706
Jammin' Jeromes.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.107
(laughs)

27:21.140 --> 27:22.842
I get a second?

27:22.875 --> 27:24.343
Yeah. Sure.

27:24.376 --> 27:27.146
Give the people what they want.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.649
-How you feeling? Good?
-Mm-hmm.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.654
Shit, that man
about to quit today.

27:35.688 --> 27:38.858
-That man got five kids.
-(laughs)

27:38.891 --> 27:41.961
You know, I was hoping you might
let us store some of the product

27:41.994 --> 27:43.629
in the back.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.264
Just for a while.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.134
That wouldn't be smart.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.669
-They came to my house,
they'll come to my business.
-Nah.

27:50.703 --> 27:53.572
Andre being on the bench means
we got some breathing room.

27:53.605 --> 27:55.975
Ain't gonna be no more raids
for a minute.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.978
It's just temporary.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.546
Besides, you're the one who said

28:00.579 --> 28:02.014
you don't want to have
to leave the shop

28:02.048 --> 28:03.482
to go re-up with Manboy.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.484
Don't this make
your life easier?

28:06.518 --> 28:08.654
-Okay, temporary.
-Good.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.423
One more thing.
What you remember

28:11.457 --> 28:13.025
about cousin Jack? Alton's side?

28:13.059 --> 28:14.994
He the one who got shot, right?

28:15.027 --> 28:16.595
You know he was a snitch?

28:16.628 --> 28:17.897
Heard some rumors
back in the day.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.231
People believe that rumor?

28:19.265 --> 28:21.934
Some did. Fuck you asking?

28:21.968 --> 28:24.737
(chuckles) Nah, I'm just...
just curious to know happened.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.305
What difference does it make?

28:26.338 --> 28:28.440
Cops don't need no reason
to kill a black man.

28:28.474 --> 28:29.675
Don't you mean the FBI?

28:29.708 --> 28:31.878
Alton said they killed him.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.379
You need to ask Alton
about that.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.047
Come on before I change
my goddamn mind.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.249
Have to move some stuff
around here.

28:37.283 --> 28:39.451
Make sure you put that stuff
behind the inventory.

28:39.485 --> 28:41.087
-Mm-hmm.
-(door opens)

29:00.873 --> 29:03.242
Boys. (whistles)
Go see what rooms you like, hmm?

29:04.576 --> 29:06.678
BOY:
Andale, ándale, vamos.

29:06.712 --> 29:08.714
Mira.

29:12.785 --> 29:15.721
We might not be able
to leave after all.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.923
Why?

29:23.462 --> 29:25.064
He threatened to kill me.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.166
Come after all of us.

29:27.199 --> 29:28.767
You remember him?

29:28.801 --> 29:30.837
What he did to get put away?

29:39.778 --> 29:41.080
MRS. MOSLEY:
It's back here.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.748
When you're not using it,
unplug it.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.951
Damn thing's so old,
it overheats.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.953
Yes, ma'am.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.921
(sighs)

29:48.955 --> 29:50.923
Any idea where to start?

29:50.957 --> 29:52.624
Only paper that covered
our murders--

29:52.658 --> 29:55.661
back then and even now--
is the L.A. Sentinel.

30:01.667 --> 30:04.136
Clean up your mess
when you're done.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.139
*

30:37.136 --> 30:38.770
*

30:45.644 --> 30:47.813
"Active member of the
Black Panther Party found dead.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.849
Single gunshot wound
to the head. No gun recovered."

30:52.851 --> 30:55.487
A single gunshot?

31:10.202 --> 31:12.504
I have a question.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.740
Hmm?

31:14.773 --> 31:16.542
(clears throat)

31:16.575 --> 31:18.577
It's something that Rigo said.

31:20.646 --> 31:23.415
Yeah, the DEA agent?

31:23.449 --> 31:25.717
You overheard.

31:25.751 --> 31:27.219
Well, I mean, technically,

31:27.253 --> 31:29.888
I read his lips, but yeah.

31:36.528 --> 31:37.863
She'd left the DEA.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.498
She was working with me.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.867
She was collecting intel
on various Colombians,

31:41.900 --> 31:43.669
including Rigo.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.271
"Was"?

31:49.308 --> 31:51.877
Yeah, I made a mistake.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.180
Tried to be in two places
at the same time.

31:54.213 --> 31:55.747
It was fucking stupid.

31:57.783 --> 32:00.719
I miscalculated...

32:00.752 --> 32:03.589
and she died.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.696
Jesus, Teddy.

32:13.665 --> 32:16.335
What about her body?

32:17.403 --> 32:19.405
It's gone.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.211
For good. I mean,
the Agency's not exposed,

32:25.244 --> 32:26.745
if that's what you're asking.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.815
(sighs)

32:38.157 --> 32:41.127
I'm sorry.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.463
Yeah, me, too.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.643
(sighing)

33:01.847 --> 33:03.982
(door closing,
footfalls approaching)

33:07.986 --> 33:09.955
I'll go to school.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.291
But I want to do the road trip.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.226
The one we talked about
last year.

33:14.260 --> 33:17.063
Santa Fe. Dallas.

33:17.096 --> 33:19.931
School doesn't start
for another three weeks.

33:19.965 --> 33:22.034
We take all that time.

33:22.068 --> 33:24.170
By then I'll be healed.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.771
How soon you want to leave?

33:25.804 --> 33:27.339
Tomorrow.

33:27.373 --> 33:28.740
Day after at the latest.

33:28.774 --> 33:32.278
I've got to pack
and say bye to my friends.

33:32.311 --> 33:35.381
(sighs) Sounds fair.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.316
There's a party tonight.

33:37.349 --> 33:41.187
Lots of people will be there,
and I'd like to go.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.255
(chuckles)

33:43.289 --> 33:45.291
Anything else?

33:48.127 --> 33:50.862
Okay.

34:05.010 --> 34:07.079
You have something for me, Avi?

34:07.113 --> 34:09.515
I do.

34:09.548 --> 34:13.319
But there's one thing
I want to make clear first.

34:13.352 --> 34:15.921
I've survived a lifetime

34:15.954 --> 34:18.857
in a game into which
you have barely dipped

34:18.890 --> 34:22.894
your pinky fucking toe.

34:22.928 --> 34:27.099
And I'm not going away
any time soon.

34:27.133 --> 34:30.068
Certainly not by some punk kid

34:30.102 --> 34:34.573
who somehow got it into his head
he's the black Bronson.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.675
You got what I came here for,
or no?

34:36.708 --> 34:39.278
Yeah... I'm gonna give it to you

34:39.311 --> 34:41.247
because I'm a man of my word.

34:41.280 --> 34:45.050
Ah, no, Avi. You're gonna give
it to me because you lied to me

34:45.083 --> 34:47.686
and because you owe me.

34:47.719 --> 34:51.089
Don't get this shit
twisted, Avi.

34:51.123 --> 34:53.058
You brought this on yourself.

34:53.091 --> 34:56.061
(winces) I fear the kind of man
you're becoming.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.096
(chuckles)

35:00.232 --> 35:03.802
There's one more thing
that's not in the file,

35:03.835 --> 35:07.739
but it's gonna cost you
another week of free interest.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.108
Go on.

35:10.142 --> 35:13.912
The pilot, Matt,

35:13.945 --> 35:17.916
he wasn't his partner.
He was his brother.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.119
You sure?

35:21.153 --> 35:24.556
We were in Panama,
he was out of his mind on coke,

35:24.590 --> 35:28.327
his dick in some hooker's mouth,
and he let it slip.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.230
Matt may not be his real name,

35:31.263 --> 35:34.433
but they're certainly brothers.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.571
I'll call you
when I have your money.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.675
Good.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.588
Tel Aviv, 1978.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.824
Entered the country
as James Smith.

35:58.857 --> 36:01.827
Two years later,

36:01.860 --> 36:03.595
in Tehran.

36:03.629 --> 36:06.097
That time he was known
as Thomas Parker.

36:08.133 --> 36:10.135
So he is CIA.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.003
Uh-huh.

36:12.037 --> 36:13.839
ALTON:
Anything else?

36:13.872 --> 36:16.475
Uh, his real name?
Who he's with here?

36:16.508 --> 36:17.909
His history before that?

36:17.943 --> 36:20.178
No. That...

36:20.212 --> 36:22.681
that's it.

36:22.714 --> 36:25.384
So now what?

36:29.187 --> 36:31.757
He's never taken you
anyplace official?

36:31.790 --> 36:34.125
You never signed anything
or received money?

36:34.159 --> 36:36.027
No, but I gave him money
for the product.

36:36.061 --> 36:38.264
-He working with anyone?
-Here and there.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.266
It's always changing.

36:40.299 --> 36:43.001
But the one person
he said was his partner,

36:43.034 --> 36:45.404
turns out that guy
might be his brother.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.709
He's isolated.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.878
From the Agency.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.646
It's gonna be that way, too,

36:54.680 --> 36:56.482
'cause the government will want
to distance themselves

36:56.515 --> 36:58.684
from pumping drugs
into our community.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.185
He's alone.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.186
You're not.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.588
And you've got money.

37:02.621 --> 37:03.922
A lot of it.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.458
We can use that to fortify you.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.363
(quietly):
Yeah.

37:16.535 --> 37:18.370
(grunts)

37:18.404 --> 37:21.206
And there's something else
I wanted to ask you.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.074
Uh, about Jack?

37:23.108 --> 37:28.347
I'd imagined Jack was gunned
down in a hail of gunfire.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.081
A bloodbath.

37:30.115 --> 37:31.917
But he wasn't.

37:31.950 --> 37:35.954
He was killed by a single bullet
fired to the head.

37:37.022 --> 37:40.258
What really happened to him?

37:58.610 --> 38:00.846
When the FBI were done with him,

38:00.879 --> 38:05.250
they told anybody who would
listen that he was a snitch.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.886
And when the Panthers
caught wind of it...

38:08.887 --> 38:11.790
...they were furious.

38:13.725 --> 38:16.127
We all were.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.733
(knocking)

38:24.770 --> 38:27.172
(creaking)

38:33.311 --> 38:35.781
And they wanted him tortured.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.083
(chuckles)

38:38.116 --> 38:40.519
So they could see him suffer.

38:46.525 --> 38:49.495
And I wasn't about
to let that happen.

39:02.307 --> 39:05.644
So you killed him.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.119
I don't expect...

39:14.152 --> 39:15.421
No.
