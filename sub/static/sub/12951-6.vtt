00:03.103 --> 00:05.571
CIA profile:
Agent Sydney Bristow.

00:05.572 --> 00:06.471
Okay. I'm in.

00:06.473 --> 00:09.408
Agent Bristow works undercover
with her father, Jack Bristow.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.276
Also a double agent with CIA.

00:11.277 --> 00:12.711
Get down!

00:12.712 --> 00:14.847
I guess we'll have to learn
to trust each other.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.348
Bristow's CIA contact:
Michael Vaughn.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.184
My guardian angel.

00:19.185 --> 00:23.781
Her current assignment:
to infiltrate and destroy SD-6.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.519
A secret organization
dealing in espionage,

00:26.593 --> 00:29.756
extortion, weapons sales,
posing as the CIA.

00:29.829 --> 00:32.695
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.700
SD-6 director: Arvin Sloane.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.431
The sanctity of this agency
requires the sacrifice

00:37.504 --> 00:38.937
of some personal freedoms.

00:38.938 --> 00:41.438
This is not about cutting off
an arm of the monster.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.342
This is about killing
the monster.

00:43.343 --> 00:46.574
Bristow's mother,
formerly Russian intelligence,

00:46.646 --> 00:49.240
recently turned herself in
to the CIA.

00:49.315 --> 00:51.016
Mom?

00:51.017 --> 00:52.418
Intel indicates

00:52.419 --> 00:55.252
she may still be
an enemy of the United States.

00:56.456 --> 00:59.289
The true loyalty
of Agent Bristow's mother

00:59.359 --> 01:01.360
remains unknown.

01:01.361 --> 01:03.861
Previously on "Alias"...

01:12.361 --> 01:15.390
Let's talk about last week,
the incident in Madagascar.

01:15.425 --> 01:18.419
My mother informed us that the building
was safe to enter.

01:18.454 --> 01:20.418
In truth, it was a trap.

01:20.419 --> 01:23.019
Derevko had rigged it with explosives

01:24.419 --> 01:27.019
Washington has made a decision
regarding your mother.

01:27.419 --> 01:30.019
What she did to you invalidated her
agreement with the CIA

01:30.419 --> 01:32.919
The government is pressing charges.

01:33.419 --> 01:37.019
I saw de Souza. He told me that
you hired him to rig those explosives.

01:38.019 --> 01:40.819
Sydney will never know about
what I've done.

01:41.019 --> 01:43.018
You betrayed her trust.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.018
I won't.

01:44.019 --> 01:46.018
You want me to hypnotize you?

01:46.019 --> 01:48.018
I need to know what happened to me.

01:48.019 --> 01:50.519
Where are you Sydney?

01:50.819 --> 01:52.818
In my room...

01:52.819 --> 01:55.319
When I was little.

02:02.819 --> 02:05.519
You took away my choices in life.

02:05.819 --> 02:08.519
You programmed me to be a spy.

02:10.818 --> 02:12.518
You weren't trying to
protect me from her,

02:12.519 --> 02:15.019
you were trying to protect
your secret.

02:16.519 --> 02:19.519
So the first opportunity you had,
you set her up...

02:20.519 --> 02:23.519
I will never forgive you for this.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.999
Your mother's trial starts
this morning.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.500
How long do you think it'll last?

02:33.535 --> 02:34.699
Could be a while.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.599
With eighty-six counts of
espionage against her,

02:36.600 --> 02:42.600
the prosecution alone could take
months just to present their case.

02:45.100 --> 02:48.265
I want to see the opening arguments.

02:48.300 --> 02:51.100
I'll arrange for a closed-circuit
feed into the ops center.

02:51.135 --> 02:57.100
Thanks.

02:58.400 --> 03:04.365
You know any jokes?
'Cause I could use one.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.100
This grasshopper walks into a bar
and the bartender says,

03:07.135 --> 03:09.399
"Hey, we have a drink named
after you!"

03:09.400 --> 03:10.199
And the grasshopper says...

03:10.200 --> 03:12.900
"You have a drink named Doug?"

03:12.935 --> 03:15.565
Well, I was going to use Phil.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.599
Well, Phil is certainly no
funnier than Doug.

03:17.600 --> 03:23.600
No, I know, I'm sorry.
It's a non-humorous, uh...

03:33.900 --> 03:35.199
Mr. Sark.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.800
As you know, he's proven himself
to be a key player

03:37.835 --> 03:40.365
in the world of international
organized crime.

03:40.400 --> 03:44.000
Now he may be developing a
bio-weapon systemized form a virus

03:44.035 --> 03:46.399
that we've never seen before.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.400
This is Klaus Richter,
a former employee of Sark's

03:49.435 --> 03:51.817
whom we've recently taken into
custody.

03:51.852 --> 03:54.199
A routine medical workup
revealed that

03:54.200 --> 03:58.600
Richter may have been exposed to
the virus before we picked him up.

03:58.635 --> 03:59.399
Marshall?

03:59.400 --> 04:00.399
Thank you, sir.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.900
Okay, now, take a look on your
screen here.

04:02.935 --> 04:04.199
These little squiggly things...

04:04.200 --> 04:06.199
that's just a normal flue
anti-body,

04:06.200 --> 04:09.300
something that you might have
if you got a common cold, or cough, something.

04:09.335 --> 04:10.499
Now let's take a look at
Richter's blood work.

04:10.500 --> 04:14.500
Now this shows antibodies one
thousand per cent above normal levels.

04:14.535 --> 04:18.166
Very similar to the Ebola virus,
most notably massive hemorrhaging.

04:18.202 --> 04:21.765
Except that this virus works by
breaking down bonds between cells,

04:21.800 --> 04:25.500
so basically Richter's body in
just a couple of days is gonna look oooh like,

04:25.535 --> 04:27.399
well, did you ever see that movie
"The Fly"?

04:27.400 --> 04:30.500
Do you remember that little poor
red-assed baboon when he was, like,

04:30.535 --> 04:31.299
turned inside out?

04:31.300 --> 04:32.999
Thank you, Marshall.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.500
We recently uncovered a charter
agreement indicating

04:35.535 --> 04:38.300
that Sark rented a medically
equipped 727

04:38.335 --> 04:40.299
to transport three patients

04:40.300 --> 04:43.300
presumably suffering from the same
virus as Richter

04:43.335 --> 04:44.699
to a private hospital in Geneva.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.099
This hospital is one of Sark's
business fronts.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.965
We believe he's assembled a team
to study the virus.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.365
Your objective is to infiltrate
the facility and acquire the research.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.100
Jack, you'll be entering the hospital
as a patient in need of a kidney transplant.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.800
Sydney, you'll be accompanying him as the
loving daughter who's agreed to donate one.

05:03.835 --> 05:06.600
I trust this one won't be
too much of a stretch,

05:06.635 --> 05:10.700
hmmm, for either of you?

05:10.735 --> 05:11.499
We should talk.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.799
We have nothing to talk about.

05:12.800 --> 05:13.999
I know you have questions.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
You can either be angry,
or you can be informed.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.600
Please try to understand what
I'm about to tell you, Sydney.

05:23.635 --> 05:26.400
After your mother left, I tested
Project Christmas on you

05:26.435 --> 05:28.499
because I didn't want you to
be a victim.

05:28.500 --> 05:32.400
I thought it was my responsibility
to teach you how to think strategically,

05:32.435 --> 05:33.499
to see through people's lies,

05:33.500 --> 05:35.299
to be as strong as you could be

05:35.300 --> 05:38.199
in an environment where one
mistake could cost you your life.

05:38.234 --> 05:41.099
Then you should've told me the
truth before I ended up here.

05:41.100 --> 05:45.865
Yes, you're right!

05:45.900 --> 05:50.565
I never intended you to lead a
double life.

05:50.600 --> 05:55.500
I imagined recruiting you into
the CIA after you finished college.

05:55.535 --> 05:57.599
But Sloane got to you first,

05:57.600 --> 06:03.600
and that is a mistake I will
never live down.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.465
I'd like to believe you,

06:09.500 --> 06:15.500
but I don't trust anything you say.

06:26.400 --> 06:30.900
Closed-circuit's online, the
proceeding start in about a minute.

06:30.935 --> 06:33.400
And the feed will be right
over here.

06:33.435 --> 06:34.299
Thanks, Rick.

06:34.300 --> 06:34.499
Sure.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.299
That's Senator Douglas.

06:36.300 --> 06:37.699
Where's the judge?

06:37.700 --> 06:41.500
Distinguished witnesses, I know you
were expecting opening arguments

06:41.535 --> 06:43.499
for the prosecution of Irina Derevko,

06:43.500 --> 06:47.500
but as of this morning a plea agreement
has been reached with the defendant.

06:47.535 --> 06:50.265
In regard to the eighty-six counts
of espionage

06:50.300 --> 06:53.200
leading to the deaths of twelve
United States operatives,

06:53.235 --> 06:57.365
Derevko has pled guilty on all counts.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.400
A select penalty jury was
empanelled early this morning

07:00.435 --> 07:02.965
and the decision was predictably
swift.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.400
Derevko received the maximum
sentence under federal statute...

07:06.435 --> 07:08.865
death by lethal injection.

07:08.900 --> 07:11.365
Since she's opted to forego
all appeals,

07:11.400 --> 07:16.400
the execution will be carried out
three days from today.

07:16.435 --> 07:22.400
Session adjourned.

07:26.500 --> 07:31.165
Confidential to Deputy
Director Devlin.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.100
I'm writing to inform you that
my father, Jack Bristow,

07:34.135 --> 07:37.117
did willfully deceive the CIA
into believing

07:37.152 --> 07:40.100
Irina Derevko violated
her immunity agreement.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.799
I'm committing this statement
to paper

07:42.800 --> 07:48.800
so it may be used in an official
capacity to halt my mother's execution.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.199
Despite her past crime,

08:01.200 --> 08:04.000
I can't in good conscience allow
her sentence to be carried out

08:04.035 --> 08:06.965
when she kept her word to
cooperate with us.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.400
It is not Irina Derevko who should
be answering to these charges.

08:11.435 --> 08:13.399
It is my father.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.799
We have a dead drop.
Request pick up.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.499
Looks like a letter.

08:16.500 --> 08:22.500
Copy that. Sending agent
for retrieval.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.765
When my mom first came back,
I wanted her dead.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.900
How the hell did I become the
person who's trying to save her?

08:29.935 --> 08:32.198
That doesn't mean that you have
to be her best friend.

08:32.200 --> 08:38.200
It means that you did
the right thing.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.198
How are you?

08:40.200 --> 08:43.965
Oh, I got my, uh, thirty days
sobriety chip.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.600
Even though I wasn't ever a drug
addict, I'm kind of proud.

08:48.635 --> 08:50.699
Oh, by the way, you know anybody
who wants a car?

08:50.700 --> 08:51.699
I'm hocking mine.

08:51.700 --> 08:52.799
You're selling your car?

08:52.800 --> 08:56.000
Yeah, well, it's either that or
I quit paying my student loans.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.199
I can't afford to have bad credit
and a criminal record.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.000
Well, I know you're going to say
no but I can lend you money.

09:01.035 --> 09:03.700
Yes, I'm gonna say no.

09:03.735 --> 09:06.800
But thank you.

09:06.835 --> 09:07.499
Hey.

09:07.500 --> 09:11.900
In the morning, I got rear-ended
by four frat guys coming home from a party.

09:11.935 --> 09:13.999
Two of them threw up while I was
getting their insurance information.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.399
At least they had insurance.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.499
Why are you cleaning like this?
You're acting like Howard Hughes.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.499
Well, the Zagat guy is coming to
give his review today.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.799
I want this place spotless.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.699
There's a hamburger behind you.

09:22.700 --> 09:23.599
You know, Francie, I

09:23.600 --> 09:26.800
I worked up through Los Feliz and
Atwater Village.

09:26.835 --> 09:28.199
Oh, cool, Cliff, thanks.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.299
Give me just a second, Okay?

09:30.300 --> 09:33.200
I told him I'd give him a couple bucks if he
just handed out some fliers, got the word out.

09:33.235 --> 09:34.999
Hamburgers aren't on the menu,
are they?

09:35.000 --> 09:35.299
Garden burger.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.599
How much are you paying that guy?

09:36.600 --> 09:37.599
Twelve bucks an hour.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.999
Hamburger's making more than I am.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.600
Keep cleaning, sweetie.

09:43.635 --> 09:44.699
I gotta clean.

09:44.700 --> 09:47.200
I gotta catch a plane.

09:47.235 --> 09:48.099
Be safe.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.199
Okay.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.600
Sir, if you'll recall Project
Christmas was developed by Jack Bristow

09:53.635 --> 09:56.365
to train potential CIA recruits
at a young age.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.300
Now, based on the research Irina
Derevko stole from him,

09:59.335 --> 10:01.199
the KGB developed their own
version of the project.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.399
Yes, I recall.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.500
One of our assets in Moscow just
sent this over.

10:05.535 --> 10:07.499
It's a test questionnaire
administered

10:07.500 --> 10:09.299
to a group of first
graders in the early eighties.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.699
The test was designed to identify
kids who would make good agents

10:11.700 --> 10:13.699
in the Soviet secret service.

10:13.700 --> 10:14.499
Reading over it,

10:14.500 --> 10:17.065
what really struck me is how
similar these questions

10:17.100 --> 10:20.100
are to a standard IQ test given
to first graders in this country.

10:20.135 --> 10:21.299
Where are you going with this?

10:21.300 --> 10:23.399
Remember the rumor going around
the agency during the Cold War

10:23.400 --> 10:26.600
about the Soviets raising sleeper
agents as Americans?

10:26.635 --> 10:28.199
Now, I know it sounds
potentially paranoid,

10:28.200 --> 10:29.099
but this is how they would do it

10:29.100 --> 10:32.000
if they managed to get their test
in circulation here.

10:32.035 --> 10:34.199
They could have contacted hundreds
of kids.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.665
Interesting, but unlikely.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.300
I just think it would be
interesting to analyze tests from...

10:40.335 --> 10:41.099
Stop.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.899
We can't spare a single agent
right now,

10:42.900 --> 10:46.400
much less a team for a project
that at best has historical value.

10:46.435 --> 10:52.400
The KGB doesn't even exist anymore!

11:19.500 --> 11:23.900
I see your mother's latest maneuver
had its intended effect on you.

11:23.935 --> 11:24.999
What maneuver would that be?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.700
Pleading guilty, accepting the
death penalty.

11:27.735 --> 11:28.799
Yep.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.499
She's got us right where she wants us.

11:30.500 --> 11:33.965
Not us. You.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.799
Your mother's no fool.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.299
She must have deduced I set her up,

11:37.300 --> 11:40.965
so why do you imagine
she pled guilty?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.399
Because she was struck by a crisis
of conscience?

11:43.400 --> 11:46.265
I think she knew the verdict was
a foregone conclusion.

11:46.300 --> 11:49.700
She pled guilty to keep you from
witnessing her trial, Sydney,

11:49.735 --> 11:53.100
from having you see photos of the
agents she savagely murdered,

11:53.135 --> 11:55.199
including Vaughn's father.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.099
She knew if you sat through that,

11:57.100 --> 12:01.200
whatever sympathy she'd managed to
elicit from you would vanish,

12:01.235 --> 12:02.999
so

12:03.000 --> 12:05.565
she cast herself as the victim

12:05.600 --> 12:09.400
to compel you to save her and
guess what?

12:09.435 --> 12:14.465
You fell for it.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.700
I thought you deserved a second
chance to think things over.

12:17.735 --> 12:20.517
Here's your letter.

12:20.552 --> 12:23.265
How'd you get that?

12:23.300 --> 12:26.600
I spent a decade with this woman

12:26.635 --> 12:29.865
and another twenty years analyzing

12:29.900 --> 12:34.100
how she could have deceived
me for so long.

12:34.135 --> 12:35.599
Trust me when I tell you,

12:35.600 --> 12:39.300
I am protecting you.

12:39.335 --> 12:41.765
No, you're not.

12:41.800 --> 12:47.400
I think you loved Mom so much that
when she left you, you lost your soul.

12:47.435 --> 12:48.899
You know what else I think?

12:48.900 --> 12:51.900
I think the kind of man who'd use
his own daughter to frame her mother,

12:51.935 --> 12:55.765
who'd test psych experiments when
she was six-years-old

12:55.800 --> 13:01.800
is the kind of man who looks at
his daughter and sees his greatest mistake.

13:03.700 --> 13:07.400
You can't honestly believe that.

13:07.435 --> 13:11.765
It's true, isn't it?

13:11.800 --> 13:14.765
If Mom hadn't fooled you,

13:14.800 --> 13:19.100
if you hadn't been so gullible,

13:19.135 --> 13:23.400
I never would have been born.

13:28.200 --> 13:34.200
I'm going to finish reviewing the
mission now.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.299
Thanks. Thanks for coming.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.499
Of course. Is everything all right?

14:28.500 --> 14:32.165
Okay, look, I don't...

14:32.200 --> 14:34.900
I don't know how to say this other
than to just say it.

14:34.935 --> 14:36.799
I need a job.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.399
With all the publicity, no one
will hire me.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.399
I thought maybe you could
help me out.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.799
I mean, I don't mean to be
an agent.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.199
I know the CIA has a ton of front
companies...

14:45.200 --> 14:48.065
defense contractors,
shipping companies.

14:48.100 --> 14:49.899
I'll work at a desk, anywhere,
just as long...

14:49.900 --> 14:51.099
Look, I know this will
drive you insane,

14:51.100 --> 14:56.450
but we can't employ you because
you have a criminal record.

14:56.485 --> 15:01.800
I have a criminal record because
of a drug habit I never had.

15:11.700 --> 15:17.700
You know anybody who wants to
buy a car?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.299
There might be something.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.599
I have a discretionary fund used
for informants.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.899
Totally off the books.

15:23.900 --> 15:27.100
I could pay you to do research.

15:27.135 --> 15:30.265
Seriously? Man, I would so owe you.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.765
This is a list of questions,
please keep them to yourself.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.750
All I need you to do is find out
if any of these questions ever appeared

15:35.785 --> 15:38.592
on a standardized test in the United States
over the last twenty years.

15:38.627 --> 15:41.400
Okay, the more you tell me the faster
I can get you what you want, so...

15:41.435 --> 15:46.200
I pay by the hour. Take your time.

15:46.235 --> 15:47.099
Thank you.

15:47.100 --> 15:49.600
You're welcome.

15:49.635 --> 15:54.765
Geneva

15:54.800 --> 15:56.699
Mr. Harris,

15:56.700 --> 15:59.600
I'm Jan Spinnaker, hospital
administrator.

15:59.635 --> 16:01.399
Welcome to St. Auburn's.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.400
My daughter, and the very twinkle
of my eye... Marion.

16:04.435 --> 16:07.065
Daddy, stop it! It's so nice to
meet you.

16:07.100 --> 16:10.100
A pleasure to meet a daughter
who'd sacrifice so much for her father.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.899
I would do anything for my Daddy.

16:11.900 --> 16:15.165
This way, please.

16:15.200 --> 16:19.050
The computer in this satchel
provides me a secure link to my money.

16:19.085 --> 16:22.900
The satchel cannot be removed
from my arm during the operation.

16:22.935 --> 16:24.199
All arrangements have been made...

16:24.200 --> 16:27.765
Now, I chose your hospital for
its high security standards.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.300
We employ security with training
equivalent to the secret service.

16:31.335 --> 16:32.399
You won't be disappointed.

16:32.400 --> 16:38.400
Very good!

16:43.800 --> 16:46.400
Okay, you're going to Geneva to
get a sample of a top-secret virus.

16:46.435 --> 16:49.000
Now, your cover is you're going in
for kidney transplants.

16:49.035 --> 16:50.099
Well, now, you're probably
thinking now,

16:50.100 --> 16:52.199
"Hold on a second, Marshall!
We need our kidneys!"

16:52.200 --> 16:53.399
Well, don't worry.

16:53.400 --> 16:57.965
They're not going anywhere
because of this.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.300
Now, basically, when you are
positioned in the OR,

17:02.335 --> 17:04.765
press this button lightly twice.

17:04.800 --> 17:08.065
It will activate a tank of
halothane.

17:08.099 --> 17:14.099
Now, halothane is the same anesthetic
they're pumping through your masks.

17:17.300 --> 17:20.300
Why don't you both try counting
backwards from ten?

17:20.335 --> 17:24.865
Ten... nine... eight...

17:24.900 --> 17:27.098
Which leads us to question
number two.

17:27.099 --> 17:31.400
If they're pumping anesthesia in the
room and you're also gulping it down...

17:31.435 --> 17:32.399
what did I do with...

17:32.400 --> 17:33.599
by the maskfull,

17:33.600 --> 17:37.400
then what's going to prevent us
from passing out ourselves?

17:37.435 --> 17:39.299
The solution is in the solution.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.699
It's a mix of anti-anesthesia and
I also,

17:41.700 --> 17:42.799
for good measure,

17:42.800 --> 17:46.900
threw in a time release synthetic
caffeine that I use in my decaf every morning.

17:46.935 --> 17:50.300
Just take it right before you head
into the hospital and trust me,

17:50.335 --> 17:52.599
you won't fall asleep.

17:52.600 --> 17:58.600
Seven... Six... five... four...
three... two... one...

18:25.500 --> 18:31.500
They'll be out for fifteen minutes.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.699
They've all been sedated for the pain.

18:34.700 --> 18:36.399
Patient zero's in there.
Get a blood sample,

18:36.400 --> 18:42.400
I'll download the viral research.

19:03.900 --> 19:08.865
Irina?

19:08.900 --> 19:11.649
I need help!

19:11.684 --> 19:14.399
Don't struggle.

19:14.400 --> 19:18.100
He could tear the gloves off,
you could become infected.

19:18.135 --> 19:21.400
I'll up his morphine.

19:21.435 --> 19:27.400
Irina?

19:36.500 --> 19:38.499
His vitals fell below the preset
warning levels.

19:38.500 --> 19:41.100
The doctors will be alerted.
Work fast.

19:41.135 --> 19:42.199
Eagle eye, this is blackbird.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.865
Requesting early extraction,
LZ Bravo.

19:44.900 --> 19:50.900
Copy that, blackbird. ETA...
LZ Bravo, three minutes.

20:02.200 --> 20:08.200
Come on. Come on, come on, come on!

20:34.200 --> 20:40.200
This is Dr. Giselle, I need security
teams on the research level, now!

20:40.400 --> 20:41.199
We need to get to the roof.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.299
The elevator won't come to
this floor!

20:42.300 --> 20:43.899
Security will flank us from both
sides of the hall.

20:43.900 --> 20:49.900
We can't reload the tranqs fast
enough to take out another four people.

20:51.900 --> 20:52.999
Find some iodine.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.800
Ammonia and iodine form an unstable
compound when they're mixed together.

20:58.835 --> 21:04.800
Initiate level three lockdown,
perimeter and elevators!

21:06.600 --> 21:11.065
I've got this!

21:11.100 --> 21:17.100
Blackbird, we're on the roof,
we're waiting for you!

21:18.600 --> 21:19.699
Don't shoot!

21:19.700 --> 21:25.700
Against the wall!

21:46.500 --> 21:52.500
Bypass the lockdown, I'll hold
them off!

22:24.400 --> 22:30.400
Buy me ten seconds,
I need more time!

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
Ammo!

22:53.800 --> 22:59.800
Sydney!

23:20.600 --> 23:24.400
If you're wondering why that man
mistook you for your mother,

23:24.435 --> 23:26.199
he worked for her.

23:26.200 --> 23:30.900
I skimmed the research as it was
downloading.

23:30.935 --> 23:33.867
Before she surrendered to the CIA,

23:33.902 --> 23:36.765
Irina deliberately ordered Sark

23:36.800 --> 23:42.800
to expose some of her own operatives
to the virus in order to study it.

23:43.300 --> 23:49.300
Ask yourself if that's a person
worth saving.

24:10.100 --> 24:14.965
Los Angeles

24:15.000 --> 24:16.999
I had toxicology analyze the
glass of wine

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
that somehow made its way into
my house last week.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.165
They found a compound called VTX

24:25.200 --> 24:31.200
which counteracts the effects of
sodium morphate.

24:31.900 --> 24:35.900
Sodium morphate is the poison I
used to...

24:35.935 --> 24:39.117
end Emily's suffering.

24:39.152 --> 24:42.265
I see two possibilities.

24:42.300 --> 24:45.100
Either Emily predicted your
intention to euthanize her,

24:45.135 --> 24:47.499
took the necessary countermeasures

24:47.500 --> 24:49.399
and is now playing a game with you,

24:49.400 --> 24:51.399
or the more likely scenario...

24:51.400 --> 24:54.100
someone wants you to believe
Emily's alive

24:54.135 --> 24:56.099
or worse,

24:56.100 --> 25:00.065
they'll try and make the Alliance
believe it, too.

25:00.100 --> 25:04.300
If they think that I failed to carry
out the one condition of my admittance,

25:04.335 --> 25:06.099
that I have been betraying them
the whole time,

25:06.100 --> 25:11.200
then they'd be forced to assume
that my entire division is rogue.

25:11.235 --> 25:14.465
Then we'll all be in danger.

25:14.500 --> 25:18.800
I don't think I can ever forgive
my father for the things he's done,

25:18.835 --> 25:22.100
but maybe he's right about what
he's been saying all along

25:22.135 --> 25:24.099
Maybe her cooperation is part of

25:24.100 --> 25:26.965
some elaborate strategy he's more
equipped to see than I am.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
Look, your father's asking you to
let her die for something she might do.

25:30.035 --> 25:33.900
I don't think you can live
with that.

25:33.935 --> 25:35.999
Good work in Geneva.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.799
Thanks.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.700
The CIA is analyzing the copy of
the disk you brought back.

25:40.735 --> 25:42.799
If SD-6 plans on using the virus
as a weapon

25:42.800 --> 25:44.799
we might be able to get a jump on
the antidote

25:44.800 --> 25:46.199
thanks to the blood work
you brought back.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.299
I hope so.

25:47.300 --> 25:48.999
Oh, listen, there's something
else you should know.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.599
Will came to me for a job.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.299
He did?

25:51.300 --> 25:52.199
Well, he didn't want to bother you

25:52.200 --> 25:54.800
so I hired him off the books to do
some research.

25:54.835 --> 25:56.199
On what?

25:56.200 --> 25:58.900
Just background on the old KGB
version of Project Christmas.

25:58.935 --> 26:00.299
Of course, I didn't tell him that.

26:00.300 --> 26:03.300
He thinks he's comparing IQ tests
against the public record.

26:03.335 --> 26:06.900
I just figured it was your
prerogative to tell him more.

26:06.935 --> 26:09.400
That was really nice of you, thanks.

26:09.435 --> 26:12.365
You're welcome.

26:12.400 --> 26:16.800
There's nothing more boring than
a commerce bureau luncheon.

26:16.835 --> 26:22.800
Thanks for joining me, Jack.

26:32.800 --> 26:38.265
What is it?

26:38.300 --> 26:39.699
Did you... see that?

26:39.700 --> 26:45.700
See what?

27:30.300 --> 27:34.965
Can I help you?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.899
Aaaah! Did you see someone come
in here just now?

27:36.900 --> 27:38.599
A woman?

27:38.600 --> 27:40.499
No, I've been alone all morning.

27:40.500 --> 27:45.500
Father, would you excuse us, please?

27:45.535 --> 27:48.865
Sit down.

27:48.900 --> 27:50.799
Now you tell me you saw her!

27:50.800 --> 27:53.465
I saw a woman but it could have
been anyone.

27:53.500 --> 27:56.900
You may be suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder

27:56.935 --> 27:59.667
brought on by intense feelings
of guilt.

27:59.702 --> 28:02.400
Arvin, you have walked into
a church.

28:02.435 --> 28:08.400
A place to confess.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.265
She's alive.

28:11.300 --> 28:14.565
She knew the alarm code.

28:14.600 --> 28:18.800
She could have come into the
house undetected.

28:18.835 --> 28:23.800
There is a clear way to know
for certain

28:23.835 --> 28:29.800
but I hesitate to suggest it.

28:29.900 --> 28:32.665
Sir, there's something I have
to report.

28:32.700 --> 28:36.500
While it appeared that my mother
sent me into a trap in Madagascar,

28:36.535 --> 28:39.117
in truth, she was unaware that
there was any danger.

28:39.152 --> 28:41.700
Yes, I know. I have your father's
statement right here.

28:41.735 --> 28:44.400
He told us himself this morning.

28:44.435 --> 28:44.999
What?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.399
A hearing has been scheduled with
the joint intelligence committee.

28:47.400 --> 28:50.065
My intention wasn't to punish my
father, sir,

28:50.100 --> 28:53.600
it was to stop my mother's
execution from going forward.

28:53.635 --> 28:55.199
excuse me

28:55.200 --> 28:58.365
Yes?

28:58.400 --> 29:01.465
I'll send her down right now.

29:01.500 --> 29:07.500
They'd like to see you in
medical services.

29:10.300 --> 29:11.599
You asked to see me?

29:11.600 --> 29:13.499
Agent Bristow, I'm Doctor Nicholas.

29:13.500 --> 29:14.999
What's going on?

29:15.000 --> 29:18.700
Five weeks ago you infiltrated one
of your mother's laboratories in Taipei

29:18.735 --> 29:20.399
where you discovered a Rambaldi device.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.765
How long were you in proximity to
the device?

29:23.800 --> 29:29.800
I... it took me about a minute to
rig it with explosives.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.700
I made it to the other side of the
door but Vaughn was submerged.

29:33.735 --> 29:37.267
I don't know, maybe another minute
or two.

29:37.302 --> 29:40.551
Will someone please tell me what's
going on?

29:40.586 --> 29:43.800
We believe the device is the
source of the virus

29:43.835 --> 29:45.799
that infected the men in Geneva.

29:45.800 --> 29:50.100
Unfortunately, you and Agent
Vaughn may have been exposed.

29:50.135 --> 29:51.999
I'm sorry.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
We'd like to draw some blood and
keep you under observation.

29:55.035 --> 29:57.199
If Sloane pages me, this is gonna
be a problem.

29:57.200 --> 30:03.200
Your father's been informed. He's
covering for you.

30:27.300 --> 30:33.300
I know.

31:19.800 --> 31:20.999
Hi.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.399
Hey.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.899
Did you close your eyes at all?

31:23.900 --> 31:26.099
On and off.

31:26.100 --> 31:28.299
You talk in your sleep.

31:28.300 --> 31:30.865
No!

31:30.900 --> 31:32.199
What did I say?

31:32.200 --> 31:34.499
"Don't frost the pie!"

31:34.500 --> 31:39.300
It seemed really important.

31:39.335 --> 31:45.300
No idea.

31:47.300 --> 31:49.499
You think we're sick?

31:49.500 --> 31:55.500
I don't know.

31:56.400 --> 32:02.400
Vaughn, can I tell you something?

32:03.500 --> 32:05.799
Agent Bristow, your tests came
back negative for antibodies,

32:05.800 --> 32:07.799
you're free to go.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.765
Agent Vaughn, your tests at this
point are inconclusive.

32:10.800 --> 32:13.700
We did find a heightened level of
antibodies in your blood stream

32:13.735 --> 32:16.500
but you could simply be fighting
off a cold.

32:16.535 --> 32:17.999
We won't know for a few more hours.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.399
You'll have to stay.

32:20.400 --> 32:24.400
You said Sark tested patient's
blood at the first sign of infection.

32:24.435 --> 32:28.965
What was the sign?

32:29.000 --> 32:35.000
Hemorrhaging from the fingernails.

32:37.900 --> 32:39.199
It'll be fine.

32:39.200 --> 32:45.200
Your dad's hearing's in an hour,
you should go.

33:08.900 --> 33:10.299
I'll see you soon.

33:10.300 --> 33:16.300
Yeah.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.599
Agent Bristow,

33:31.600 --> 33:34.600
this hearing's been convened to
determine an appropriate

33:34.635 --> 33:37.600
punishment for the crimes depicted
in your statement.

33:37.900 --> 33:40.699
Before we begin our inquiry,

33:40.734 --> 33:43.499
do you have anything to say?

33:43.500 --> 33:47.565
Only that despite my admission of
guilt,

33:47.600 --> 33:51.765
I still firmly believe Irina
Derevko is a threat

33:51.800 --> 33:54.500
and will prove it at her earliest
possible convenience.

33:54.535 --> 33:57.300
Is that how you justify lying to
your superiors,

33:57.335 --> 33:59.299
endangering other agents?

33:59.300 --> 34:01.499
Yes.

34:01.500 --> 34:04.665
Why this sudden change of heart?

34:04.700 --> 34:08.300
Deferentially, Senator, my reasons
are my own.

34:08.335 --> 34:11.665
I see.

34:11.699 --> 34:13.399
Reviewing your file,

34:13.400 --> 34:15.900
I was shocked to discover how many
times you've displayed behavior

34:15.935 --> 34:19.065
that at best can be characterized
as rogue.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.699
You have lost the benefit of the
doubt here, sir,

34:21.735 --> 34:23.699
and your silence will not suffice.

34:23.699 --> 34:25.899
So again, I ask you,

34:25.900 --> 34:31.165
why the change of heart?

34:31.199 --> 34:34.465
My daughter convinced me that I
acted unethically.

34:34.500 --> 34:38.500
Isn't it a fact that you knew your
daughter intended to turn you in

34:38.534 --> 34:41.665
and that you beat her to the punch
only by an hour

34:41.699 --> 34:44.800
in order to secure a degree of
leniency from this body?

34:44.835 --> 34:50.800
No, sir, that is not the case.

34:54.100 --> 34:59.265
Sydney Bristow, my daughter...

34:59.300 --> 35:03.200
has come to believe that when I
look at her,

35:03.235 --> 35:09.200
I see the embodiment of all my
flaws.

35:10.400 --> 35:14.200
And this afternoon when I learned
that she may have been exposed

35:14.235 --> 35:15.099
to a life-threatening disease,

35:15.100 --> 35:19.300
I realized that she might die
believing that.

35:19.335 --> 35:23.500
But nothing could be further from
the truth.

35:23.535 --> 35:24.999
When I look at her,

35:25.000 --> 35:28.800
when I look at the little girl who
raised herself to become

35:28.835 --> 35:31.099
one of the most extraordinary
human beings

35:31.100 --> 35:37.100
and one of the finest agents I've
ever had the privilege of knowing,

35:37.200 --> 35:41.800
I see only the promise of my own
redemption.

35:41.835 --> 35:43.799
Turning myself in was the only way

35:43.800 --> 35:47.100
I could think of to make that
clear to her,

35:47.135 --> 35:51.565
to prove that despite...

35:51.600 --> 35:56.765
my limited abilities as a father,

35:56.800 --> 36:02.800
I love her more than I could ever
say.

36:19.900 --> 36:21.299
I didn't order this.

36:21.300 --> 36:27.300
It's from the gentleman at the bar.

36:36.700 --> 36:37.699
You okay?

36:37.700 --> 36:39.299
Yeah, clean bill of health.

36:39.300 --> 36:42.265
Apparently, I am fighting a cold.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.100
I came by to see you after the
hearing but they were still running tests.

36:45.135 --> 36:47.965
I know, they told me you came here.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.900
This is ridiculous, being in the
same restaurant on the phone.

36:51.935 --> 36:53.799
Listen, Syd, I, um,

36:53.800 --> 36:57.100
I actually came by to
tell you something.

36:57.135 --> 37:00.400
They're sending your father
to prison.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.799
You're kidding?

37:02.800 --> 37:04.899
It gets worse.

37:04.900 --> 37:09.000
Douglas decided your mother's
immunity agreement was never binding.

37:09.035 --> 37:12.200
They're going to carry out her
death sentence anyway.

37:12.235 --> 37:18.200
Her execution goes ahead tomorrow
at eight am.

37:21.000 --> 37:26.765
Washington, DC.

37:26.800 --> 37:32.800
Welcome back to Washington,
Senator.

37:42.200 --> 37:48.200
Ed, you missed the exit.

37:51.900 --> 37:57.900
Hello?

38:13.800 --> 38:17.065
No! No! Hey!

38:17.100 --> 38:20.965
You're making a BIG mistake!

38:21.000 --> 38:22.699
Sorry about the detour, Senator...

38:22.700 --> 38:22.799
What the hell are you doing?!

38:22.800 --> 38:24.599
...but I need two minutes of your
undivided attention.

38:24.600 --> 38:25.799
I don't care what point you want
to make!

38:25.800 --> 38:27.999
I'd like you to consider dropping
the charges against my father

38:28.000 --> 38:29.799
and honor my mother's
immunity agreement.

38:29.800 --> 38:29.999
You can't be serious.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.199
I recognize how indecisive this
sounds...

38:32.200 --> 38:33.199
That's a full understatement, my dear!

38:33.200 --> 38:34.799
...I turned her in under
false pretenses

38:34.800 --> 38:36.799
and I've come to believe my father
was protecting me.

38:36.800 --> 38:37.799
His interest are irrelevant,

38:37.800 --> 38:42.400
it's his decisions that matter.

38:42.435 --> 38:45.365
I'm sorry, Agent Bristow,

38:45.400 --> 38:47.399
but my colleagues and I have zero
tolerance for anyone

38:47.400 --> 38:49.399
who would lie to their
own government,

38:49.400 --> 38:51.099
especially in this day and age.

38:51.100 --> 38:52.399
And your mother?

38:52.400 --> 38:56.000
Well, she's had it coming for
twenty years.

38:56.035 --> 38:59.065
Now given what you've been through,

38:59.100 --> 39:03.400
I'm willing to forgive your little
misstep tonight.

39:03.435 --> 39:09.400
Would you kindly drop me off
at home?

39:23.200 --> 39:29.200
Wait in the car.

40:39.300 --> 40:41.499
How did you persuade Douglas to
reverse himself?

40:41.500 --> 40:45.300
I told him I have a secret only
you and I know about.

40:45.335 --> 40:47.900
A secret that Sloane told you in
confidence that

40:47.935 --> 40:49.899
poses such a
threat to national security

40:49.900 --> 40:52.400
that we couldn't trust even the
CIA to contain it.

40:52.435 --> 40:54.499
What secret is that?

40:54.500 --> 40:56.399
One of your colleagues...

40:56.400 --> 40:57.599
a United States senator...

40:57.600 --> 40:59.799
is working for the Alliance.

40:59.800 --> 41:04.200
We have evidence of wire
transfers totaling 6.3 million.

41:04.235 --> 41:05.199
To whom?

41:05.200 --> 41:06.399
That's what we're trying to find out.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.299
But without my mother and father,

41:08.300 --> 41:14.300
I'll be forced to hand over the
investigation to the FBI.

41:15.300 --> 41:18.300
There's no senator in the
Alliance's pocket. You lied.

41:18.335 --> 41:22.665
I'm not proud of what I did.

41:22.700 --> 41:26.000
I may not agree with your decision
to interact with your mother, Sydney,

41:26.035 --> 41:27.399
but I will from now on

41:27.400 --> 41:32.700
respect that it is your decision
to make.

41:32.735 --> 41:34.299
They're bringing in your mother now.

41:34.300 --> 41:40.300
I'm sure you'll want to see her.
