I have no complaints about HHM.

You took the Davis and
Main job because of me.

I took that job because
it was the right decision.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.432

[Sighs] Well, I drove into
the city this morning.

01:16.467 --> 01:19.501
U-Usually, I take the train,
but I was in just such a rush

01:19.537 --> 01:21.803
to get some
medicine for my son, Freddie.

01:21.839 --> 01:24.773
He has epilepsy.

01:24.808 --> 01:27.275
He had an attack this
morning, but during his fit,

01:27.310 --> 01:29.009
he knocked the bottle of medicine

01:29.045 --> 01:31.312
out of my wife's hand and just...

01:31.348 --> 01:33.314
bam, one huge puddle.

01:33.350 --> 01:34.782
That's terrible.

Well, long story
short... drove into town,

01:37.820 --> 01:41.188
bought the new medicine with every
last nickel in my pocket,

01:41.224 --> 01:42.656
and then my car died.

Oh, God, that's... that's just, uh...

01:44.760 --> 01:46.192
[Chuckling] I know.

convinced myself

01:57.506 --> 01:59.472
that Freddie's gonna
have another seizure

01:59.507 --> 02:02.675
before I get back with the medicine.

02:02.710 --> 02:06.812
So, I-if you can help
me, I would be so grateful.

02:06.847 --> 02:09.247
Well, I could come out and
check your car for ya.

02:09.283 --> 02:11.216

possibly just spare $5 instead...

happen if it wasn't his?

He's not a forensics expert.

07:24.575 --> 07:26.075

Maybe it, uh, fell from
a passing bird's beak,

and Mr. Salamanca caught
it and tried to throw it away.

you, Mr. Ehrmantraut?

down, he probably would've...

just a formality, right?

24:08.040 --> 24:09.806
You and me, together.

24:09.842 --> 24:11.308
[Breathes sharply]

24:11.344 --> 24:13.877
If Schweikart can pay
your debt, so can I.

24:13.912 --> 24:17.347
And with my signing
bonus, you'll have a clean slate.

24:17.382 --> 24:18.748
The sky's the limit.

24:18.783 --> 24:20.583
Hey, we're good together.

24:20.618 --> 24:21.851
You know that.

24:21.887 --> 24:23.552
So, what's stopping us?

24:23.588 --> 24:26.589
Let's jump in with both
feet, be our own bosses,

24:26.624 --> 24:28.391
build our own future.

24:29.961 --> 24:31.927
"Be our own bosses." [Chuckles]

24:31.962 --> 24:33.262
What about clients?

24:33.297 --> 24:35.597
Mesa Verde just
signed with you, didn't they?

24:35.632 --> 24:38.033
[Scoffs] It'll be a hard
sell to take them with me.

24:38.068 --> 24:40.002
So, then there will
be another Mesa Verde.

24:40.037 --> 24:42.204
That was all you, Kim.

24:42.239 --> 24:45.274
You did it once. You can do it again.

24:46.377 --> 24:48.675
You make it sound easy.

24:48.711 --> 24:50.544
No. You're talking to a guy

24:50.579 --> 24:52.947
who lived in the back of a nail salon.

24:52.982 --> 24:55.616
No, this is gonna be a whole
lot of blood, sweat, and tears...

24:55.651 --> 24:57.418
at least, at the start.

24:57.453 --> 25:00.687
But in the end, we'll have a
practice that is 100% ours...

25:00.723 --> 25:02.390
- that's worth it.
- [Sighs]

25:02.425 --> 25:04.691
Or we fail and we end up with nothing.

25:04.727 --> 25:06.859
Well, you're right... it's a gamble.

25:06.895 --> 25:08.128
It's a big one.

25:08.163 --> 25:10.063
Yeah, but you're betting on yourself,

25:10.098 --> 25:12.966
and from where I sit, the
odds are in your favor.

25:13.001 --> 25:14.467
You're an amazing lawyer.

25:14.502 --> 25:17.070
This is your chance to
show the world that.

25:19.841 --> 25:21.607
So, why not go to Schweikart?

25:21.643 --> 25:22.975
They'll make me partner,

25:23.010 --> 25:24.944
and they are a solid, respectable firm.

25:24.979 --> 25:26.412
You can't deny that.

25:26.447 --> 25:28.480
You deserve more than
just a lateral move.

25:28.515 --> 25:30.715
Bottom line... that's
what Schweikart represents.

25:30.751 --> 25:32.751
He's just Howard
Hamlin by a different name.

25:32.786 --> 25:34.619
You keep talking about
me and Schweikart.

25:34.655 --> 25:36.221
What about you and Davis & Main?

25:36.257 --> 25:38.457
That's over. I quit today.

25:38.492 --> 25:41.025
Well, technically, I got fired.

25:42.628 --> 25:43.894
What happened?

25:43.930 --> 25:46.464
It was mutual and a long time coming.

25:46.499 --> 25:48.666
That job was never the right fit for me.

25:48.701 --> 25:50.634
This is.

25:55.208 --> 25:57.941
If we're gonna be law
partners, I need to know one thing.

26:00.712 --> 26:03.013
What kind of lawyer are you gonna be?

26:03.048 --> 26:05.282
I don't mean what kind of
law are you gonna practice.

26:05.317 --> 26:06.850
I mean [sighs]

26:06.885 --> 26:10.253
Are you gonna play it straight,

26:10.289 --> 26:13.689
or are you gonna... be colorful?

26:13.724 --> 26:17.994
I'm gonna play it
straight, right down the line.

26:18.029 --> 26:22.131
I'm gonna dot every "I,"
and I'm gonna cross every...

26:30.673 --> 26:34.009
There's no point in me doing
this if I can't be myself.

26:34.044 --> 26:37.045
Every time I try to do
things someone else's way,

26:37.080 --> 26:38.713
it blows up in my face.

26:38.748 --> 26:41.149
That's what happened at Davis & Main.

26:41.184 --> 26:42.950
Look how that turned out.

26:42.986 --> 26:46.787
I almost derailed your
career, pissed everyone off.

26:46.823 --> 26:48.489
I've been trying to be

26:48.524 --> 26:51.225
the person someone
else wants me to be for...

26:51.260 --> 26:52.826
I don't know how long.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.728
I mean, first, it was Chuck,

26:54.763 --> 26:57.498
then it was you... and
that's not your fault.

26:57.533 --> 26:58.649
That was my choice.

26:58.650 --> 27:04.137
But if we're gonna do
this, I got to go into it as me.

27:04.172 --> 27:06.139
So, yeah.

27:06.174 --> 27:08.574
Colorful, I guess.

27:08.609 --> 27:10.576
What do you say?

27:11.679 --> 27:13.546
I just...

27:13.581 --> 27:16.149
I don't see why it's so important to you

27:16.184 --> 27:17.583
that we work together.

27:17.618 --> 27:19.352
I mean, we're already...

27:19.387 --> 27:21.653
[Chuckling] Why do you need me for this?

27:21.688 --> 27:25.590
I don't need you... I want you.

27:25.625 --> 27:27.892
You've got me...

27:27.928 --> 27:31.729
just not as a law partner.

27:41.407 --> 27:44.007
I have to get back to work.

27:44.043 --> 27:45.376
You okay?

27:45.411 --> 27:46.710
Yeah.

27:46.745 --> 27:49.580
No, I'm fine.

27:49.615 --> 27:51.748
Go on.

27:52.818 --> 27:55.085
- See you later?
- [Scoffs]

27:55.120 --> 27:56.752
[Chuckling] Yeah.

28:03.962 --> 28:06.129
It's move-in ready, as you can see.

28:06.164 --> 28:09.199
And they've renovated within
the past three years...

28:09.234 --> 28:11.201
new floors, new kitchen.

28:11.236 --> 28:12.601
[Inhales deeply]

28:12.636 --> 28:15.370
And it's a good amount of space.

28:15.406 --> 28:18.273
It's not too much house, you think?

28:18.309 --> 28:19.908
No, not at all.

28:19.943 --> 28:22.244
And look at that backyard.

28:22.279 --> 28:24.813
They're leaving the playhouse.

28:24.848 --> 28:26.781
- Isn't that amazing?
- [Chuckles]

28:26.817 --> 28:28.617
Kaylee will go crazy for that.

28:28.652 --> 28:30.618
You'll never get her outta there.

28:30.653 --> 28:32.720
I know, right?

28:32.755 --> 28:34.155
And the most important part...

28:34.190 --> 28:36.124
the schools are good and
the neighborhood is great.

28:36.159 --> 28:39.127
I called the local precinct
and asked about the crime stats...

28:39.162 --> 28:41.129
they're some of the lowest in the city.

28:41.164 --> 28:42.930
Plus, I got a good vibe from him.

28:42.965 --> 28:44.898
Like, they sounded really responsive.

28:44.934 --> 28:46.133
That sounds perfect.

28:46.168 --> 28:47.667
Yeah. [Sighs]

28:47.702 --> 28:49.169
Do you like it?

28:49.204 --> 28:51.971
If you're happy, I'm happy.

28:52.007 --> 28:53.473
Do you like it?

28:53.509 --> 28:55.842
Yeah, I do, but I'm...

28:55.877 --> 28:58.845
- But what?
- It's a lot of money.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.847
I know... I'm like a
broken record, but it is.

29:00.882 --> 29:02.282
You don't worry about that.

29:02.317 --> 29:04.150
We'll make it happen, whatever the cost.

29:04.185 --> 29:05.584
- Mike.
- Hey, I'm serious.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.986
Not another thought.

29:08.022 --> 29:10.422
If you want it, it's yours.

- Fantastic.

29:25.972 --> 29:27.172
Do you have another hour?

29:27.207 --> 29:28.606
We could go down to the office,

29:28.642 --> 29:29.974
get the pre-approval
in order, all that.

29:30.009 --> 29:31.442
Oh, sounds good. We'll meet you there.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.710
Sure. See you in a few.

29:45.824 --> 29:47.507

so much as scratched it.
