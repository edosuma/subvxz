13:26.055 --> 13:27.102
No, I was...

13:27.181 --> 13:29.809
It's just not gonna happen. Yep.

13:29.892 --> 13:30.984
I know it.
I agree.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.687
All right, good.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.733
What?
Oh, I'm gonna...

13:43.740 --> 13:44.741
(VIOLET GIGGLES)

13:44.824 --> 13:45.916
Hello.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.001
VIOLET: Gideon.
TOM: Oh, hi.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.579
I just wanted to say
congratulations to both of you.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.166
I really couldn't have picked a better
choice for my favorite ex-girlfriend.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.250
Aw! Thank you
very much.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.052
I didn't know that you
were going to be here.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.880
Uh... Yeah. Your mom said I could
come, so I just popped over.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.599
From London,
through Atlanta.

14:02.759 --> 14:03.760
And Houston.

14:04.510 --> 14:08.560
Right. I am going
to go to the loo and...

14:09.307 --> 14:10.775
I think you literally just
went to the bathroom.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.523
Mmm... Didn't. No.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.026
How was Afghanistan?

14:20.109 --> 14:21.110
It was harrowing.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.574
I was there
for the capture of

14:22.653 --> 14:26.624
Mullah Abdul Akhtud El Sayed
Ahmed Shafeer Salaheen.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.368
Amazing.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.875
<i>Um...</i> Violet is
a fantastic woman.

14:31.954 --> 14:32.921
She is.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.965
How long have you guys
been together?

14:35.291 --> 14:36.964
Just...
Just over a year.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.304
We were together for
four and a half years.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.717
You think after four years you're gonna be
spending the rest of your life together.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.804
Now you get her, even though you're
still just in the first quarter.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.564
Do you want me to get you a
glass of wine or something?

14:49.639 --> 14:50.640
No.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.934
Oh! Good timing.
Gideon, stop crying.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.649
This is an emotional
moment for me.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.814
No, this is an emotional
moment for Tom and I.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.991
You are a guest at
our emotional moment.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.118
Congratulations.
Okay. All right.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.993
(INHALING DEEPLY)
Do not smell me, Gideon.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.413
(LAUGHING) That is awful!

15:10.368 --> 15:11.369
You like that one?

15:11.452 --> 15:13.204
I hate all of them.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.252

VIOLET: I want to get that job
offer in the mail from Berkeley

15:25.591 --> 15:28.344
and become
a psychology professor.

15:28.428 --> 15:32.433
Work with brilliant people and
just dig in for the next 40 years.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.735
And I want to open
my own restaurant

15:35.810 --> 15:39.610
with a private room in the
back just for you and me.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.741
And our 20 kids.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.285
And all of our little pigs. Hmm.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.594
Don't worry, we'll get some breakfast in a bit.
You'll feel better.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.966
Not eggs.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.551
Oh! Alex!

16:04.964 --> 16:06.591
VIOLET: Hey.
TOM: Hey.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.222
Hey
Yo!

16:09.302 --> 16:11.521
I didn't think you were
going to stay the night.

16:11.596 --> 16:15.146
Yeah, I didn't want to drive
home last night in my condition.

16:15.224 --> 16:18.023
So, I just
got myself a room.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.354
Oh, nice.
Yeah.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.189
Whoa, Suz!
VIOLET: Suzie.

Hey, Suz.
Oh. Hi.

TOM: Come join the fun.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.911
Oh. Hey.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.950
Hey. Yeah.
Hello.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.747
You know Suzie.

16:39.582 --> 16:40.925
(WHISPERING)
Shut the fuck up.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.590
Guess what I really
did last night?

16:48.049 --> 16:49.722
I'll give you
69 guesses.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.516
Oh, my God!

16:59.268 --> 17:00.269
Hi.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.151
Hi.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.949
I'm Audrey.
I'm the new hostess.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.901
Audrey? Oh, cool, I'm Tom.

17:06.983 --> 17:08.281
Nice to meet you, Tom.
Nice to meet you.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.363
I'm the sous-chef here.
How is it going today?

17:10.445 --> 17:11.446
Good. How are you?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.000
Okay, I'm great. Yeah, it's
nice to have you aboard.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.076
Thank you.
Yeah.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.160
You'll make a great
part of the team.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.244
He's engaged.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.829
How's your fiancée doing?

17:20.289 --> 17:21.290
I-m

17:21.999 --> 17:23.672
Thank you.
Nice to meet you.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.674
Nice to meet you, also.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.387
What the fuck was that?

17:27.463 --> 17:29.431
What are you doing? You're
flirting with the help.

17:29.507 --> 17:32.010
I was not flirting, okay?
ALEX: Oh, really?

17:32.093 --> 17:33.595
I was being friendly.
ALEX: Yeah, right.

17:33.678 --> 17:38.104
You were sending telepathic wiener
missiles at her face, and you know it.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.065
SALLY: What are
all these tickets?

17:46.148 --> 17:48.276
You guys getting ready
to go to a Broadway show?

17:48.359 --> 17:51.738
I need three lamb and potatoes
and I actually need them now.

17:51.821 --> 17:52.993
Yes, Chef!
SALLY: I'm done with you.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.119
Give me that,
I'll do it myself.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.241
Thank you. Thank you. Alex,
how long on my steaks?

17:55.324 --> 17:56.416
Two minutes!

17:56.492 --> 17:58.836
Come on, come on, move,
you guys, like there's...

Oh, my God!

TOM: Chef, you have
to go to the hospital.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.338
Tom, you're in charge.
TOM: You got it, Chef.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.220
SALLY: I need a doggy
bag for my finger.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.888
TOM: All right, let's move.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.844
We got a shitload
of foie gras.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.770
I need you to push
the foie gras gelato.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.769
How long on the gelato, Alex?
I need it yesterday.

18:18.848 --> 18:19.849
ALEX: Four minutes.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.855
Hey, I need hands on all
those dishes in the window.

18:21.934 --> 18:22.935
Please, guys.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.568
Yeah, guys, I need hands
on my carrot wiener.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.657
Alex, put the
carrot wiener away.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.749
The face is the worst part of it all.
Get back to the foie gras.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.085
Hi, Granny Leonora.
Hi, Grampy.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.875

<i>Violet, love, will you be getting
married in London or down in Sussex?</i>

18:48.836 --> 18:51.339
Actually, Baba, we will
be doing the wedding

18:51.422 --> 18:53.390
in the Bay Area
in San Francisco.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.219
You could get married here,
in the village church.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.602
Get married in England, where you're from.
In London, come on.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.182

Oh, that's good.
Yeah.

19:32.546 --> 19:34.173
I really love it.
It's really beautiful.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.550
So, is it your wedding?
Yes, yeah, it is.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.261
That's too bad.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.096
You're so beautiful.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.768
Okay.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.019
(SIGHING)

19:47.728 --> 19:48.729
It's wonderful,
isn't it?

19:48.813 --> 19:50.281
It is so great.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.158
It's beautiful. When's the
next available weekend?

19:53.234 --> 19:55.032
In three years.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.988
Unless you want to get
married on September 11th.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.286
I don't.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.790
Don't let the
terrorists win.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.380
Yes!
Great!

20:06.455 --> 20:07.923
Okay, good, so this
is gonna be fun.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.877
Of course, the men
will wear yarmulkes.

20:11.293 --> 20:14.888
And, in that case, all eligible
Christians will be served communion.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.592
Communion? What, we're gonna have
communion at my son's wedding?

20:17.758 --> 20:20.807
Um... It is our
wedding, Pete.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.806
And, I mean, seeing as everyone
is gonna be wearing yarmulkes.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.810
Well, actually, only the men
will be wearing yarmulkes, so.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.646
Well, I've never heard you say
the word "yarmulke" until today.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.111
TOM: Excuse me, I say "yarmulke" all the time.
VIOLET: You don't.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.612
Like, "Hey,
where's my yarmulke?

20:34.692 --> 20:36.069
"Babe, have you
seen my yarmulke?"

20:36.152 --> 20:37.574
Babe, you don't
have a yarmulke.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.748
I have a whole... It's in
my Jewish drawer. You...

20:42.825 --> 20:45.294
I mean, how are you supposed to
even pick a dress from a magazine?

20:45.369 --> 20:48.498
Look at all of them, they're all
just white and puffy and stupid.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.463
Vi, come on. Hey!
(SIGHING) What?

20:51.542 --> 20:53.169
It's supposed
to be exciting.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.721
This is your wedding.
You only get a few of these.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.970
I didn't
get into Berkeley.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.768
It was the perfect teaching job.
It was local.

I'm so sorry, babe.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.434
I'm going to be married
within the year.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.019
I'm gonna be pregnant
within two years

21:10.853 --> 21:14.107
and no career, I'll just
be changing nappies

21:14.190 --> 21:17.114
and washing dishes
and making apple pie.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.537
And I want that,
I want it all,

21:19.612 --> 21:21.285
but I want to have
the career as well.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.115
It's not enough for me.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.793
I mean, it's fine.
I can reapply next year.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.415
You don't have
to get upset.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.465
It's fine. Why do you always
turn things into your thing?

21:31.540 --> 21:32.666
(TEARFULLY) No.
Come on!

21:32.750 --> 21:34.718
I'm sorry.
What?

21:34.794 --> 21:36.671
I can't help it.
It must be the hormones.

21:36.754 --> 21:40.179
What, you're at that time of the month again?
You're always on your period.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.725
No.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.428
What is it, then?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.268
Are you pregnant?

21:48.057 --> 21:49.650
Just a little.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.102
Just a little?

Suzie!

21:53.813 --> 21:55.315

Crikey!

I know this is your time,

21:57.233 --> 21:59.702
and I just... I don't want to
take the attention away from you.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.040
I don't want
to tell you.

Let me take
some guesses, okay?

22:06.534 --> 22:07.831
Just don't even
think about it.

You didn't say it,
only I said it!

Is it Alex?
It is Alex.

Oh, gross!

22:15.417 --> 22:17.215
Of course it is. Jesus!

No! He is a moron.

22:20.923 --> 22:22.220

Absolutely. Theirs was
pretty, but I was very cold.

Okay, right?
Yeah.

I was chilly

25:24.106 --> 25:25.358
Okay.
I got in.

25:26.191 --> 25:29.035
Oh, my God! Congratulations,
that's great!

25:29.111 --> 25:31.034
No, no, no, it's not.
It's actually terrible.

25:31.113 --> 25:33.582
You know, I've been
sitting here panicking

25:33.657 --> 25:35.159
because my mum quit
her job for my dad

25:35.242 --> 25:36.664
and she never
forgave him, ever.

25:36.952 --> 25:40.047
She became a real martyr
and she's not <i>a</i> happy person,

25:40.122 --> 25:42.170
and I just don't want you
becoming my mother.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.669
I really don't want you
becoming like her. Babe.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.763
Calm down.
Okay.

25:47.838 --> 25:48.885
Okay, it's you and me.
Yeah.

25:48.964 --> 25:51.387
We can handle anything.
I'm not scared of this.

25:51.467 --> 25:52.719
I know, I think
I'm just scared

25:52.801 --> 25:54.348
that you will
end up resenting me.

25:54.428 --> 25:55.850
This is a huge
opportunity for you.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.769
If you don't do this, you're
gonna end up resenting me,

25:58.849 --> 26:03.150
and, frankly, I would much rather
be the resentor than resented.

26:03.979 --> 26:07.654
Look, let's talk logistics.
How long is the thing?

26:08.484 --> 26:10.407
Two years.
Two years?

26:10.486 --> 26:11.783
Yeah. It's long.

26:11.862 --> 26:13.079
No, it's not.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.122
Really?

26:14.198 --> 26:16.917
In the scheme of us spending
our whole lives together,

26:16.992 --> 26:18.790
two years, that's...

26:19.995 --> 26:22.123
And then we can
come back here, right?

26:22.247 --> 26:24.966
Yeah, of course. It's just two years.
Yeah, that's...

26:25.084 --> 26:26.802
And, look, I can cook anywhere.
Right.

26:26.877 --> 26:29.380
I've cooked in New York,
I've cooked in L.A.

26:29.463 --> 26:31.932
I'm pretty sure
I can handle Michigan.

26:32.883 --> 26:33.930
Um...

26:34.009 --> 26:36.728
All right. Listen,
here's what I propose.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.398
Let's just put off the wedding.
We're not in any rush.

26:39.473 --> 26:40.474
Really?
Yeah.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.777
We'll get to Michigan,
we'll get settled in,

26:43.852 --> 26:46.025
and then we'll start planning
the wedding again from there

26:46.105 --> 26:47.527
once we have
our bearings.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.903
Tom.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.488
Oh!

26:55.531 --> 26:57.204
Can I just say something?
Yeah.

26:58.033 --> 27:02.789
I think we both know that I deserve
to get super laid for this.

27:03.539 --> 27:05.382
Do you want me to wear
a cape or something?

27:05.457 --> 27:07.255
I mean, theoretically,
whatever you want.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.551
I'm just saying I don't
want weekday sex.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.595
You're guilt-sexing me! I want a show.
I want the show.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.134
You're gonna get the show.
Good, I better.

27:12.214 --> 27:14.137
You're gonna get the
Cirque du Soleil of shows.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.470
Lots of this.
And this stuff.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.139
Not a mime.
Yeah.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.756
I'm actually here to give
you my two weeks' notice.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.885
I can't thank you enough
for all I've learned

27:53.964 --> 27:55.511
from you for the past
couple of years.

27:55.591 --> 27:56.843
It's been amazing,
and so...

27:56.925 --> 27:58.268
No.

27:59.303 --> 28:02.523
I was going to name you head
chef at my new restaurant.

28:02.598 --> 28:03.599
Clam Bar.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.438
What's going on?

28:05.976 --> 28:07.694
Wow, okay.

28:08.937 --> 28:12.441
I really wish that you would
have told me that earlier.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.117
Shit.

28:14.818 --> 28:18.243
Okay, so my fiancée,
Violet, who you've met,

28:18.822 --> 28:20.540
got a job in Michigan...

28:20.616 --> 28:23.540
This is why marriage
is dumb, okay? It's dumb.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.417
You have a job here,
and she's got a job there.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.839
You guys can't do anything
because you're so connected,

28:27.915 --> 28:29.462
so then one of you
has to get the shaft.

28:30.626 --> 28:33.129
This is why I voted
against gay marriage.

28:33.795 --> 28:34.796
Please don't tell people.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.885
Well, you know, just saying,
what are you supposed to do?

28:38.967 --> 28:41.971
It's like your fiancée
gets offered her dream job,

28:42.054 --> 28:43.146
what are you
going to do, say no?

28:43.597 --> 28:44.723
Yes.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.066
I have to go.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.143

This is a fact.

29:17.965 --> 29:20.093
They make them knowingly and
they make them consistently,

29:20.175 --> 29:23.224

on this course is, "Why?"

on a diet tomorrow,

Please remain seated. It's
probably just a false alarm.

Is behavior the person, the environment,
or a combination of the two?

In fact, you're all currently
making a bad decision.

29:52.249 --> 29:53.796
Why would you sit
through a fire alarm?

29:53.875 --> 29:57.470
Just because I, a man you've only just
met, tells you it's a false alarm

29:57.546 --> 29:59.264
doesn't mean
that in seconds' time

29:59.339 --> 30:01.012

30:01.091 --> 30:03.719

Believe it or not,
I did, yeah.

you in San Francisco?

31:10.827 --> 31:12.249
$18.50 an hour.

31:12.329 --> 31:13.546
Oh, shit!
Yeah.

31:13.622 --> 31:14.623
That's pretty good.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.753
I was lucky.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.800
I probably couldn't do
that, I could do $11.

you just said 11.

Oh, thanks. I studied at the Culinary
Institute for a couple years.

32:34.077 --> 32:35.704
Could I get
a dill with that?

32:36.246 --> 32:38.465
Well, you're welcome
to go with a dill

is way too briny for a Reuben.

<i>Now, you can eat
that marshmallow now,</i>

33:41.019 --> 33:44.944
<i>or if you wait 20 minutes, I'm
gonna give you two marshmallows.</i>

33:45.607 --> 33:47.325
<i>Okay? I'll see you later.</i>

33:48.276 --> 33:50.574
This is an experiment I did
a couple of years ago,

33:50.654 --> 33:54.534
which shows that children can have
trouble with self-regulation.

33:55.992 --> 33:59.337
As you know, if we don't get research
grants, we have no money to pay you.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.664
And, <i>as</i> of now,
we don't have one.

34:00.747 --> 34:05.127
So, we need ideas for some
studies that we can run,

34:05.210 --> 34:08.179
and this is my main
area of interest, here.

34:08.463 --> 34:12.764
Good. So I want to do the
marshmallow experiment with adults.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.264
Well, adults will just wait
for the second marshmallow.

34:15.469 --> 34:17.813
I actually don't even think
adults really like marshmallows.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.938
Yeah, well, I'm not referring
specifically to the marshmallow.

34:21.016 --> 34:22.393
What about this?

34:22.476 --> 34:24.571
What if we were to
take our subjects, right,

34:24.646 --> 34:26.694
and have them play
a driving video game?

34:27.649 --> 34:30.402
Have half of the subjects
drive the car normally.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.579
Have the other half
drive while masturbating.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.661
Why do all of your experiments
have to involve masturbation?

34:35.991 --> 34:38.494
Why do none of your experiments
involve masturbation?

34:39.159 --> 34:40.661
Um... What if we,

34:41.454 --> 34:45.755
um, casually left a box of stale
donuts in the testing room?

34:46.668 --> 34:48.841
And you inform the subjects
that these stale donuts

34:48.920 --> 34:50.513
will be replaced
with new donuts

34:51.005 --> 34:52.929
20 minutes from then.

34:53.007 --> 34:57.479
But then we watch and we see who
still goes for an old donut.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.479
What would be interesting
is if we had a manipulation.

35:01.558 --> 35:03.310
So, one group,
we could make them

35:03.393 --> 35:05.111
feel temporarily
depressed or...

35:05.186 --> 35:06.529
VANEETHA: You know
what we should do?

35:06.605 --> 35:08.278

35:08.356 --> 35:09.323
Yes.

but that shit

35:10.525 --> 35:11.947

Yeah.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.701
I would eat 10 million donuts
after watching The Notebook.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.201
Okay, I got a good one.

35:16.531 --> 35:20.161
How about we get a subject and
then put the subject to sleep,

35:20.243 --> 35:23.543
and then cover him with
blood and chicken feathers

35:23.622 --> 35:27.843
and then put a gun in his hand and
then scream inside of his ear.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.806
I think we get three psych
grad students together,

35:37.886 --> 35:40.765
and we have them come up with the
craziest, most insane experiment ideas

35:40.847 --> 35:42.849
and then we just wait
and see how long it takes

35:42.932 --> 35:45.651
for the new girl to realize that
they're totally screwing with her.

36:12.921 --> 36:16.596
I think it's elegant, it's simple,
and we all get to eat donuts.

36:16.675 --> 36:17.676
VIOLET: Great.

36:17.759 --> 36:19.011
WINTON: Well done, Violet.
Thank you.

36:19.094 --> 36:20.311
WINTON: Welcome aboard.
Thanks.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.391
(ALL LAUGHING)

36:25.308 --> 36:27.231
Okay, listen.
That's enough shoptalk.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.062
I love a love story.
How did you guys meet?

36:29.979 --> 36:31.322
I'll take this one, if
that's all right. Okay.

36:31.398 --> 36:32.399
Yeah.

36:32.482 --> 36:33.984
It was two
New Year's Eves ago.

36:34.234 --> 36:35.486
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

36:38.196 --> 36:40.039
<i>TOM: Violet was dressed
as Princess Diana.</i>

36:40.115 --> 36:42.709
<i>VIOLET: Yep, Tom was
dressed as Super Bunny.</i>

36:42.784 --> 36:43.876
<i>TOM: Guilty as charged.</i>

36:44.619 --> 36:45.620
<i>But, then...</i>

36:45.704 --> 36:47.297
WINTON: Gwyrth!
Gwyrth! Down, Gwyrth!

36:47.664 --> 36:50.213
Gwyrth! Gwyrth!
Down, boy, down. Gwyrth.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.714
Come on, there we are.
Come on.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.800
Good boy, good boy.
(WHIMPERING)

36:55.714 --> 36:58.433
Gwyrth?
What a fascinating name.

36:58.508 --> 37:01.057
It's actually pronounced
"Gwyrth." It's Welsh.

37:01.136 --> 37:02.604
Gwyrf.
Gwyth.

37:02.679 --> 37:03.931
With an "F"?

37:04.848 --> 37:06.395
Gwyrth.
Gwyrth.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.817
Ah! Like Gwyrth Paltrow.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.064
No, no, "Gwyrth."

37:09.310 --> 37:11.278
Gwyth.
WINTON: No, it's "Gwyrth."

37:11.354 --> 37:12.480
Gwyr-yth.

37:12.564 --> 37:16.114
NO. G-W-Y-R-T-H. "Gwyrth."

37:16.192 --> 37:18.286
It means "miracle" in Welsh.
He was a rescue dog.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.612
VIOLET: Nice.

37:19.696 --> 37:21.790
Well, enough about the dog.
To marriage!

37:21.865 --> 37:22.912
To marriage.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.119
Cheers, everyone.
Congratulations, both of you.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.453
VIOLET: Thank you, Winton.

37:26.536 --> 37:27.958
TOM: And to Gwyneth.

37:29.289 --> 37:30.336
(CHUCKLING)

37:30.915 --> 37:32.713
(FEIGNING LAUGHTER)

37:33.168 --> 37:35.170
Okay, I got it.
I got it.

37:35.754 --> 37:36.755
Gwi-an.

37:38.214 --> 37:39.466
Ming, please.

37:39.841 --> 37:41.093
Hey.
How you doing?

37:41.176 --> 37:42.928
You okay? Great, awesome. Yeah, yeah.
This is cool.

37:43.011 --> 37:44.479
Okay, cool. Five more minutes.
This is cool.

37:44.554 --> 37:46.272
Okay.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.478
Thank God for another
male faculty-spouse.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.358
How could you tell?

37:53.438 --> 37:55.281
I can smell it on you.

37:55.356 --> 37:56.403
Hi, I'm Bill.

37:56.483 --> 37:57.450
Hi, Tom.
It's a pleasure.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.448
Nice to meet you.
What do you do, Tom?

37:59.527 --> 38:02.576
I'm a chef, actually. But right
now, I work at Zingerman's.

38:02.697 --> 38:05.075
Holy shit! I love that place.
Hmm.

38:05.867 --> 38:07.460
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)
Yeah, it's fun.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.003
So, what do you do
for a living?

38:09.078 --> 38:10.500
I am a chef.

38:11.039 --> 38:12.461
<i>Have you seen
Ratatouille?</i>

38:13.416 --> 38:15.885
Uh, yeah.
Based on my life.

38:16.002 --> 38:18.551
(CHUCKLING) It must
resonate with you, right?

38:18.630 --> 38:21.053
Yeah, I mean, sure.
Absolutely.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.133
You work at Zingerman?
TOM: Yeah.

38:22.217 --> 38:23.890
Oh, I love that place.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.390
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah, it's fun.

38:25.512 --> 38:27.890
Can you give me
a free sandwich?

38:28.890 --> 38:30.062
Sometime?

38:30.141 --> 38:31.768
<i>Have you seen that
movie Ratatouille?</i>

38:33.311 --> 38:35.234
You know, it's so funny.
Everyone keeps asking me that.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.736
Yeah. It's a fantastic movie.
Yeah. Yeah.

38:37.816 --> 38:38.908
How about you?
What do you do?

38:39.317 --> 38:42.491
I take care of the kids,
run carpool, pack lunches.

38:42.570 --> 38:45.494
It's fantastic, watching
the little ones grow up.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.575
Sometimes I wonder where my penis went.
(CHUCKLES)

38:48.368 --> 38:50.541
It's just a joke
I like to say.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.455
(ALL CHEERING)

38:53.498 --> 38:55.671
I got a lot of quality
time with your friends.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.423
They really like
Ratatouille.

38:57.585 --> 39:00.464
VIOLET: Oh, did I ignore
you at the party?

39:00.547 --> 39:02.970
Come here. I love you.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.050
I love you, too.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.430
I'm sorry.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.433
How are you?
Are you all right?

39:07.512 --> 39:10.516
I know it's a lot.
It's an adjustment.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.976
No, I'm fine.
I really am.

39:13.726 --> 39:15.319
You know what? I had a
really good time tonight.

39:15.895 --> 39:18.990
It was a fun party.
And I like all your friends.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.739
Did you meet Bill?
Yeah.

39:21.818 --> 39:24.992
Well, Bill is going
to take me hunting.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.118
Oh, yeah?

39:26.197 --> 39:28.620
Which I feel like is
something I'm made to do.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.043
(LAUGHING)

39:31.202 --> 39:33.045
So, yeah. Yeah.
That's good.

39:33.121 --> 39:35.874
You promise me you'd tell me if you
weren't feeling all right, and...

39:35.957 --> 39:38.801
Babe, you gotta stop asking me.
I really am fine.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.379
Okay.
I am.

39:41.462 --> 39:42.634
That snow looks nice.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.717
It's fine.
Yeah, looks fine.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.802
Do you want to roll around
with me in it and get weird?

39:47.886 --> 39:48.887
You mean, like...

39:48.970 --> 39:51.814
Yeah! No one's around.
Let's get into Michigan life.

39:53.808 --> 39:56.402
Okay, it sounds great, it does.
There is one issue.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.024
What?
It's very cold out.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.071
So what?

39:59.147 --> 40:01.400
My penis is going to look
super-small for a second.

40:01.482 --> 40:03.155
I've seen your penis
every single way.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.161
Not this small.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.072
Take your pants off.
Let's do it.

40:07.155 --> 40:08.657
It's going to look
like a baby's dick.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.120
Okay, you're ruining
the moment.

40:10.199 --> 40:11.496
I'm just going to
cut you off right now.

40:11.576 --> 40:12.702
(WHISPERING) Baby dick.
Okay.

40:13.494 --> 40:14.666
(WHOOPING)

40:15.747 --> 40:18.170
Come on, it's so nice! Fuck it.

40:18.458 --> 40:19.675
Do it!
(CHEERING) Ow!

40:20.418 --> 40:22.170
What? What?
My hip, my hip!

40:22.253 --> 40:23.254
Oh, my God.

40:23.338 --> 40:24.385
I landed on something.

40:24.464 --> 40:25.465
It's a fire hydrant.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.596
What the fuck is a fire
hydrant doing there?

40:27.675 --> 40:28.927
Poor old grandpa.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.057
Oh, God.

40:30.136 --> 40:31.388
Did I just say,
"My hip, my hip"?

40:31.471 --> 40:32.939
Yes, you did.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.476
Sorry, babe.

40:43.191 --> 40:44.443
(GUN FIRES)

40:46.527 --> 40:47.779
Oh, God.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.113
I shot him.

40:49.656 --> 40:51.033
Right in the brains.

40:53.034 --> 40:55.002
Welcome to your
manhood, Tom.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.168
BILL: Hey, you...

41:03.127 --> 41:04.879
You like my sweater?

41:05.546 --> 41:06.798
Yeah.

41:06.965 --> 41:07.966
I knitted it.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.643
Oh, cool. Awesome.
Yeah.

41:10.718 --> 41:14.268
My kids used to take these
really long, boring naps.

41:14.347 --> 41:18.318
And, for a while, I just stared at them.
But then I found knitting.

41:18.393 --> 41:21.272
I can knit you one if you want.
It's super-cozy.

41:21.354 --> 41:22.731
Here, feel it.

41:25.733 --> 41:29.078
Wow, that actually
is super-cozy.

41:29.237 --> 41:30.659
Yeah.
Yeah.

41:30.738 --> 41:35.084
See, I told you this place is awesome.
You just gotta settle into it.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.166
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

41:38.663 --> 41:39.789
(HONKING)

41:56.848 --> 42:00.273
Hello!
Look at her.

42:00.768 --> 42:02.395
Let me hold her.

42:02.478 --> 42:05.448
Careful, Violet. Mind her neck.
You did it.

42:07.692 --> 42:10.115
You're so clever.

42:11.279 --> 42:12.656
It's adorable.

42:12.739 --> 42:14.787
See, he calls it an "it."

42:15.867 --> 42:18.837
Dude, Clam Bar.
Booked for an entire month.

42:19.454 --> 42:21.047
You cannot get
a table for 30 days.

42:21.122 --> 42:23.625
Thank you so much for quitting, bro.
You made my career.

42:23.708 --> 42:26.336
Oh. Yeah, I did it alt
for you, buddy.

42:26.961 --> 42:28.884
Anyways, so how's Michigan?

42:29.464 --> 42:32.889
You know, it's a bit of an adjustment.
But, all in all, it's fine.

42:32.967 --> 42:34.219
Wow.
Sorry.

42:34.302 --> 42:36.304
Have you told her
how much you hate it?

42:36.387 --> 42:37.980
I don't hate it.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.188
A bit of Irish stoicism
never hurt anyone.

42:41.267 --> 42:44.487
Well, I think it hurt
a shitload of Irish people.

42:45.396 --> 42:48.240
Bro, you gotta be
honest with her, man.

42:48.316 --> 42:49.693
I am honest.

42:50.985 --> 42:52.032
No, you're not.

42:52.111 --> 42:53.203
You're not being
honest with me.

42:53.321 --> 42:54.447
You're not being
honest with her.

42:54.530 --> 42:55.747
Don't be a martyr.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.325
Trust me, dude.

42:57.408 --> 43:01.458
You need to be honest with this woman.
She's going to be your wife.

43:01.788 --> 43:04.462
Like me, for example, when Suzie
told me that she was pregnant,

43:04.540 --> 43:05.917
I was like,

43:07.001 --> 43:10.175
"There's no fucking way
you're keeping this baby."

43:10.671 --> 43:12.344
Because that's what I felt.

43:12.423 --> 43:15.723
I was like, "No.
It's not mine, I know it."

43:15.802 --> 43:17.600
Because I was being honest.

43:17.678 --> 43:19.680
I didn't get caught up on
how that would make her feel.

43:19.972 --> 43:21.770
You know,
I was just being myself.

43:21.849 --> 43:24.568
She, of course,
figured out later

43:24.644 --> 43:28.194
that that was just panic
and anger setting in.

43:28.606 --> 43:29.607
And now she knows
that about me.

43:29.690 --> 43:31.317
So, two weeks ago, when I
was trying to talk her into

43:31.400 --> 43:33.118
giving up
the baby for adoption,

43:33.194 --> 43:35.947
she's like, "Is this panic,
and is this anger?"

43:36.030 --> 43:38.874
And I was like,
"Oh, my God, it is.

43:39.367 --> 43:40.619
"Let's keep it."

43:40.701 --> 43:43.079
Let's just...
Let's go see your family.

43:49.836 --> 43:52.009
So, darling?
VIOLET: Mmm-hmm?

43:52.964 --> 43:56.138
Any ideas when this new
wedding might happen?

43:56.634 --> 43:59.228
Mmm. No...
I mean, not yet.

43:59.303 --> 44:00.896
Because, you know,
we've just moved

44:01.013 --> 44:02.606
and it's just a big
transition, and so...

44:02.682 --> 44:05.105
Look, it's never
going to be easy.

44:05.601 --> 44:09.231
I mean, you could delay forever.
Like you did with Gideon.

44:09.730 --> 44:11.732
You always need
things to be perfect.

44:11.816 --> 44:15.116
Mum, it's hardly the same, all right?
Gideon was a complete tool

44:15.194 --> 44:16.992
and so that's why I was
procrastinating as much as I did.

44:17.071 --> 44:18.414
What's the date?

44:18.531 --> 44:20.283
I don't know yet, Mum. You've
got to make a date, darling.

44:20.366 --> 44:21.333
I don't know yet,
Mum, and I will.

44:21.409 --> 44:23.537
Pick a date. Why is
that so difficult?

44:23.619 --> 44:24.666
It's not difficult.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.088
I'm just saying that
we've just got there

44:26.205 --> 44:27.548
and we're trying
to enjoy ourselves.

44:27.623 --> 44:28.624
Pick a date. Pick it,
pick it, pick it!

44:28.708 --> 44:31.336
Okay. I cannot think with you
yelling "Pick it" at me.

44:31.419 --> 44:32.420
Shh!

44:35.464 --> 44:36.761
You know why you're not sure?

44:37.466 --> 44:39.434
No. Because you've
never been sure.

44:39.510 --> 44:41.683
Okay, what I don't understand
is that you hated marriage.

44:42.013 --> 44:43.640
So why are you
forcing me into it?

44:44.307 --> 44:47.026
Well, well, well,
Miss Smarty-pants.

44:47.351 --> 44:49.854
For your information,
I did not hate marriage,

44:49.937 --> 44:51.564
I loved marriage.

44:52.440 --> 44:55.990
I loved your father, always.
I was happy.

44:56.444 --> 44:58.321
That's why I'm so
angry with him now.

44:58.821 --> 45:00.949
I was happy with
that idiot!

45:01.532 --> 45:03.330
I'm sorry I'm
not 23 years old.

45:03.451 --> 45:05.249
I'm sorry I'm
not made in China.

45:05.328 --> 45:07.626
I'm sorry I'm not
Miss Chew Chin Chow!

45:07.705 --> 45:08.752
(EXHALES)

45:08.915 --> 45:09.916
(GROANS)

45:10.208 --> 45:11.881
Now look what you've done.

45:12.293 --> 45:13.294
(SUZIE MOANS)

45:23.012 --> 45:26.391
Crazy about Alex
and the Clam Bar, right?

45:26.474 --> 45:27.600
Yeah.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.653
It's good, though.
You know, it really is.

45:30.728 --> 45:31.980
It's good for him.

45:32.063 --> 45:33.280
Are you okay about it?

45:33.356 --> 45:34.733
I'm fine.

45:39.904 --> 45:41.747
Um... So, you know
what I was thinking?

45:41.822 --> 45:43.995
I know that we're not
in any rush or anything,

45:44.075 --> 45:47.454
but do you think maybe we should
start planning this wedding?

45:47.578 --> 45:49.501
Yes! I was just thinking that.
Yeah?

45:49.580 --> 45:50.627
Okay. Great.
Yes.

45:50.706 --> 45:52.333
I'll take the lead this time.
No.

45:52.416 --> 45:55.260
Listen, you're super-busy.
I've got time to do it.

45:55.336 --> 45:57.589
You can just... Look, pitch
in when you can, but...

45:58.256 --> 45:59.382
Would you really do that?

45:59.465 --> 46:02.344
You did everything last time.
It's a two-way street.

46:02.426 --> 46:03.803
Thank you.

46:04.595 --> 46:05.972
Of course.
That's very kind.

46:06.055 --> 46:08.149
You're a very
good planner.

46:11.727 --> 46:14.150
I hope you like Legoland.
(CHUCKLING)

46:14.230 --> 46:15.777
Because that's where
it's going to be.

46:16.274 --> 46:17.651
(CHUCKLING)

46:19.527 --> 46:20.779
(SIGHING)

46:21.070 --> 46:22.037
I'm your giant man.

46:22.113 --> 46:24.115
YOU are my enormous man.

46:33.749 --> 46:36.298
Right, so who's
going to be our actor?

46:37.962 --> 46:40.806
Hmm? No, no, please, no.
I really don't want to do it.

46:40.881 --> 46:43.304
Come on, it's simple. You just
explain the personality test,

46:43.384 --> 46:44.601
then casually mention

46:44.677 --> 46:46.145
that the day-old donuts will
be replaced by fresh ones.

46:46.220 --> 46:47.312
No, I know what
I'm going to say.

46:47.638 --> 46:49.766
Anyone who takes an old donut has
got impulse control problems.

46:49.849 --> 46:51.146
No, I know, it's just...
I'm going to freeze up.

46:51.225 --> 46:52.226
You're going
to be great.

46:52.310 --> 46:54.062
People love you. You gotta do
it, it's gonna be so much fun.

46:54.145 --> 46:56.239
(ALL CHANTING) Violet.
Violet, Violet, Violet.

46:56.314 --> 46:57.566
Okay.

46:57.648 --> 46:58.865
WINTON: Go on.
Whoo!

46:59.275 --> 47:00.993
Violet, Violet.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.326
<i>Hello, everybody.</i>

47:04.905 --> 47:08.955
<i>So, before you fill out
your personality tests,</i>

47:09.035 --> 47:12.039
<i>I just wanted to apologize
for the snacks.</i>

47:13.581 --> 47:15.879
Those donuts are
from yesterday.

47:16.334 --> 47:21.215
<i>And there will be fresh ones to replace
those ones in half of an hour.</i>

47:21.505 --> 47:23.098
She's horrible.

47:24.759 --> 47:29.105
<i>So, wait or dine,
the choice is yours. Bye.</i>

47:29.680 --> 47:31.102
MING: She's really bad.
DOUG: She's really bad.

47:31.182 --> 47:32.934
WINTON: Be nice, be nice.

47:33.017 --> 47:34.519
Hey. There she is.

47:34.602 --> 47:35.603
No, no. I messed it up.

47:35.686 --> 47:36.983
A round of applause.

47:37.063 --> 47:38.110
(ALL CLAMORING)

47:38.189 --> 47:39.862
That was so good.
That was seamless.

47:39.940 --> 47:41.442
That was a good job.

47:42.234 --> 47:44.282
WOMAN: Hi, Professor.
Hey.

47:44.362 --> 47:47.115
So, I got the save-the-date.
Very exciting.

47:47.198 --> 47:48.666
Yes, it is.

47:49.367 --> 47:50.960
What is it?

47:51.035 --> 47:52.036
What do you mean?

47:52.119 --> 47:54.213
Well, you know, I just sensed
something in your voice.

47:54.288 --> 47:56.211
Oh, no.
I don't think so.

47:56.290 --> 47:57.542
Really?

47:58.000 --> 48:00.549
No, I...
Well, I mean...

48:01.379 --> 48:03.802
Oh, sorry, look, it's none of my business.
I shouldn't intrude.

48:03.881 --> 48:05.724
You know, it's your and Tom's thing.
I understand.

48:06.008 --> 48:06.975
Really.

48:07.051 --> 48:08.428
I mean,
it's not a secret.

48:08.511 --> 48:11.981
It's just that... I think I just
wish Tom were happier here.

48:12.056 --> 48:13.228
Has he told you
he's unhappy?

48:13.307 --> 48:14.604
No, but I can tell.

48:15.351 --> 48:17.820
Listen, I think
Tom is fantastic.

48:17.895 --> 48:21.069
But you mustn't let his
situation make you feel guilty.

48:21.148 --> 48:23.150
You've worked hard
to get here. Okay?

48:23.401 --> 48:25.495
You're on the verge,
you know?

48:25.569 --> 48:27.071
It's okay to be selfish.

48:27.154 --> 48:30.499
You're a good person, a very good
person, and Tom will be fine.

48:30.574 --> 48:32.326
Tom is all right.
Tom will understand.

48:32.410 --> 48:34.412
Yeah. Right.

48:34.495 --> 48:36.338
Hey, Professor.
Hey, Ashley.

48:36.414 --> 48:37.711
God, you know
everyone here.

48:37.790 --> 48:39.007
Well, most of the girls
are called Ashley

48:39.083 --> 48:41.836
and most of the guys are called
Zack, so I play the odds.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.421
MAN: Hey, Professor.

48:43.504 --> 48:45.882
Hey, Zack. How's Ashley?

48:47.258 --> 48:48.350
(CHUCKLING)

48:48.426 --> 48:49.552
see?

48:49.927 --> 48:52.100
And now if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for tae kwon do.

48:52.179 --> 48:53.271
Okay.
(MIMICS PUNCHING)

48:53.431 --> 48:54.774
(LAUGHING)

48:59.103 --> 49:01.071
TOM: French vanilla
with coconut custard?

49:01.147 --> 49:03.275
I mean, who thinks of that?
Some sort of genius.

49:03.357 --> 49:04.779
With or without
the fruit compote?

49:05.276 --> 49:06.528
You're going to want
the fruit compote.

49:06.610 --> 49:09.534
So, you guys have,
kind of, had a lot.

49:09.613 --> 49:11.206
TOM: This cake is so good.

49:11.282 --> 49:13.000
Cake testing is the best.

49:13.075 --> 49:16.545
I know, I don't know why girls get
so tense about all this planning.

49:16.620 --> 49:17.792
It's fun!

49:19.206 --> 49:20.753
Oh, my God.

49:22.209 --> 49:23.961
You look so handsome.

49:25.921 --> 49:29.892
Maybe I should, like,
just try on a regular tuxedo.

49:30.426 --> 49:32.554
Yeah, of course.
Of course.

49:33.095 --> 49:35.644
I feel like Bigfoot
would get married in this.

49:40.436 --> 49:42.404
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

49:51.822 --> 49:53.620
God, I want a donut.

49:58.412 --> 50:00.915
You know, that's not
really a mirror.

50:00.998 --> 50:03.092
It's like, five nerds
back there, taking notes.

50:04.668 --> 50:05.794
<i>What's up, nerds?</i>

50:07.671 --> 50:09.173
<i>These donuts suck.</i>

50:11.425 --> 50:12.847
What about
the white peonies?

50:13.385 --> 50:15.387
Oh. Do you like
white peonies?

50:16.555 --> 50:17.602
Yeah.

50:17.681 --> 50:19.900
TOM: I've always heard, though, that,
I don't know if you have them,

50:19.975 --> 50:21.852
but black peonies
are much bigger.

50:21.936 --> 50:22.937
I've heard that, too.

50:23.020 --> 50:25.364
Oh, really?
Oh, I hadn't heard that.

50:25.439 --> 50:27.862
Oh! So you haven't
seen a black peonies?

50:27.942 --> 50:29.194
No, I never have.

50:29.276 --> 50:32.371
Hey, have you ever had a white
penis up your butt? (SNICKERS)

50:33.864 --> 50:35.286
(SCOFFS) Bill.

50:35.366 --> 50:36.959
VIOLET: Okay, I'm not
acting anymore.

50:37.034 --> 50:38.707
I don't like it.
I'm not doing it again.

50:38.786 --> 50:39.878
Please let me do it.

50:39.954 --> 50:42.628
No, no way.
You like it too much.

50:42.706 --> 50:43.958
Ming.
(SIGHING)

50:44.041 --> 50:45.167
God damn it!
Go on.

50:48.837 --> 50:49.963
How come nobody
ever asks me?

50:50.047 --> 50:52.721
Because you'll make
the whole room masturbate.

50:53.884 --> 50:55.386
(BOTH LAUGHING)

51:03.894 --> 51:05.817
Hmm. Impressive.

51:05.896 --> 51:10.276
It is very interesting that there was
that 25% correlation in both groups

51:10.359 --> 51:12.828
in that subjects who had a
history of life disruption

51:12.903 --> 51:14.280
also ate the stale donuts.

51:14.363 --> 51:15.410
It would be things like

51:15.656 --> 51:18.000
job loss, divorce,
trouble with the law,

51:18.075 --> 51:20.328
multiple partners,
that kind of thing.

51:20.411 --> 51:22.755
I mean, in short,
I would say that

51:22.830 --> 51:24.924
the people who ate the stale
donuts were essentially...

51:24.999 --> 51:26.171
Screw-ups.

51:26.250 --> 51:28.344
Well, yeah, I didn't
want to say, but...

51:28.419 --> 51:29.887
WINTON: Well, Violet,
congratulations.

51:29.962 --> 51:31.635
And your timing couldn't
have been more perfect.

51:31.714 --> 51:33.808
We've just got
the NIH funding.

51:33.882 --> 51:36.681
Of course, partially due
to your excellent work.

51:36.760 --> 51:40.264
And this means I can
extend your postdoc.

51:40.347 --> 51:41.690
Really?

51:41.765 --> 51:44.143
Which means you're going to be
with us for a few more years.

51:44.226 --> 51:47.605
Wow, that is fantastic.
Thank you.

51:47.688 --> 51:49.656
No, thank you, Violet.

51:50.190 --> 51:52.943
Yeah. I can't wait
to tell Tom.

52:01.619 --> 52:03.417
TOM: Hey!
Hey!

52:03.495 --> 52:06.795
Can I show you three options
for our invitation card stock?

52:06.874 --> 52:07.875
You sure can.

52:07.958 --> 52:11.383
I'm super excited.
Okay, we have got the...

52:11.462 --> 52:12.679
I love you.

52:13.547 --> 52:15.220
Aw! I love you, too.
I do.

52:15.799 --> 52:18.143
Something crazy
happened today.

52:19.386 --> 52:22.936
Winton called me into the
office and hinted that

52:23.807 --> 52:27.152
they might be
extending my postdoc.

52:31.482 --> 52:34.656
So, what does that mean
for us, exactly? Um...

52:35.444 --> 52:37.867
I think what it
probably means is that

52:37.946 --> 52:40.745
we would stay here just for
a little bit and then...

52:40.824 --> 52:42.918
Would you like
some of this wine?

52:42.993 --> 52:44.620
Nope.
No? Okay.

52:44.828 --> 52:49.709
Um, I think the first phase
would be a few years,

52:49.792 --> 52:52.545
and then, potentially,
if that went well,

52:53.629 --> 52:54.846
for longer.

52:55.130 --> 52:56.677
It sounds like
we're staying.

53:18.112 --> 53:24.290
Look, I know our plans changed, but
they changed because I did well,

53:25.035 --> 53:26.912
and I know it doesn't
feel like that to you,

53:26.995 --> 53:29.999
but maybe it's a good
thing that they changed.

53:32.292 --> 53:33.635
For you.

53:34.628 --> 53:36.380
Yes, for me, but...

53:38.716 --> 53:41.765
I've just worked so hard
for my whole life for this.

53:41.844 --> 53:44.347
I feel like I'm
on the verge, babe.

53:48.308 --> 53:51.061
And maybe it's okay
for me to be selfish.

53:52.396 --> 53:54.569
Well, if it's okay
for you to be selfish,

53:54.857 --> 53:57.827
I guess everyone else can just
figure it out on their own.

53:57.901 --> 53:59.073
Okay, that came out wrong.

53:59.153 --> 54:00.245
That came out wrong.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.697
No, I think you said
exactly what you meant.

54:02.406 --> 54:05.910
Academia's my life, Tom. I guess
you just don't understand.

54:06.493 --> 54:08.837
(SIGHING) Can I
tell you something?

54:08.912 --> 54:11.461
It makes me
feel like shit

54:11.540 --> 54:13.668
when you tell me I don't
understand things.

54:13.751 --> 54:15.549
Okay. No, listen, I
have news for you.

54:15.627 --> 54:17.345
I do understand.

54:17.421 --> 54:19.594
I understand everything,
I just don't like it.

54:20.090 --> 54:22.092
Well, I'm sorry.
You're right.

54:22.593 --> 54:23.845
It's just not nice.
Okay, look.

54:23.927 --> 54:26.225
I'm very excited about
what happened today.

54:26.305 --> 54:28.057
Do you want
to know something?

54:28.140 --> 54:31.064
As soon <i>as</i> I heard the news, I felt
instantly terrified to tell you.

54:31.685 --> 54:33.187
Now, there's something
wrong with that,

54:33.270 --> 54:35.989
that I feel like you
can't share in this with me.

54:36.064 --> 54:37.065
Even a little.

54:38.275 --> 54:40.118
I'm happy for you.

54:41.278 --> 54:44.157
(UNENTHUSIASTICALLY)
Yay! We get to stay here!

54:44.239 --> 54:45.206
You're being a prick.

54:45.282 --> 54:46.374
Then I'll just try
to be happy, too.

54:46.450 --> 54:47.702
That's not being
happy for me.

54:47.785 --> 54:48.786
I want you to be happy.

54:48.869 --> 54:50.041
That's not being
happy for me.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.372
That is martyring yourself

54:51.455 --> 54:54.925
and then blaming me for your
perceived lack of success.

54:55.793 --> 54:56.794
Now...

54:57.586 --> 54:58.678
Now I have
a lack of success?

54:58.796 --> 55:00.890
Well, I don't think you do. I
have a lack of success now?

55:00.964 --> 55:04.309
But you clearly think you do
and that's the problem.

55:04.968 --> 55:07.847
The fact remains, Tom, that
you work at a cool place,

55:07.930 --> 55:09.898
but you refuse
to see it as that.

55:09.973 --> 55:12.567
I ran a kitchen
in San Francisco,

55:12.643 --> 55:13.735
Okay
okay?

55:13.811 --> 55:15.563
And you have
no idea how it feels

55:15.646 --> 55:17.398
to be the guy
in a relationship

55:17.481 --> 55:19.199
and not have a job
that you're proud of.

55:19.274 --> 55:20.400
It's embarrassing.

55:20.484 --> 55:22.407
Why haven't we once
talked about the fact

55:22.486 --> 55:24.363
that you are upset that
you're not running Clam Bar?

55:24.446 --> 55:26.198
You never talk about it.

55:26.281 --> 55:28.329
Because I'm a man, and men
and women are different.

55:28.408 --> 55:30.661
(MOCKINGLY) We don't have to sit
around and talk about our feelings.

55:33.163 --> 55:34.710
What?
There's nothing to say!

55:34.790 --> 55:37.714
You say, "I'm upset," Tom!
You say it!

55:37.793 --> 55:38.794
Fine! You want
to talk about it?

55:38.877 --> 55:40.220
Yes!
I hate it here!

55:40.295 --> 55:41.717
Thank you!
I hate it here!

55:41.797 --> 55:43.470
Thank you for...
I think it sucks here!

55:43.590 --> 55:45.388
I think it sucks my fucking dick!
Great.

55:45.467 --> 55:46.514
Good for you.

55:46.593 --> 55:47.594
I hate it!
I hate it here!

55:47.678 --> 55:50.397
Okay, okay, okay,
but now we move forward.

55:50.472 --> 55:51.894
Now what should we do?

55:51.974 --> 55:54.068
Would you like to
open up a Clam Bar here?

55:59.690 --> 56:03.035
You can't get
fresh clams here.

56:05.237 --> 56:07.365
(EXHALING DEEPLY)
I meant it as a metaphor.

56:08.657 --> 56:10.159
(MIMICKING VIOLET EXHALING)

56:15.706 --> 56:17.879
You know what?
This is all very confusing.

56:18.041 --> 56:21.762
And I'm clearly overwhelmed
And I've gotta be honest,

56:21.837 --> 56:25.137
I think the best thing would be for
me to just be alone right now,

56:25.215 --> 56:26.432
so that I can think.

56:26.508 --> 56:27.634
Okay.

56:28.385 --> 56:31.309
I'll just give you
some time then, shall I?

56:31.638 --> 56:33.185
Well, don't go.
I mean...

56:35.017 --> 56:36.769
I need you here.

56:38.896 --> 56:41.240
What do you mean? You just
told me you needed time alone.

56:41.315 --> 56:43.488
What do you want? I don't
know what you want.

56:44.735 --> 56:46.282
I don't want you to go.
Okay.

56:46.361 --> 56:48.329
I just want to be
alone with you here.

56:51.825 --> 56:53.452
Can you at least lay down? Okay.

56:53.535 --> 56:55.162
Like a normal
human being?

56:58.707 --> 56:59.833
Do you want me just to be...
I want...

56:59.917 --> 57:01.590
Okay.
I'm trying to be alone.

57:01.668 --> 57:02.840
Yeah.

57:07.215 --> 57:08.467
(SIGHS)

57:15.766 --> 57:16.767
I'm sorry.

57:26.151 --> 57:27.277
I'm sorry, too.

57:55.889 --> 58:00.269
I know that things are really
complicated right now, babe.

58:01.103 --> 58:03.697
I just want us
both to be happy.

58:05.190 --> 58:07.568
Do you think
we could do that here?

58:14.282 --> 58:15.283
No.

58:43.812 --> 58:47.817
TOM: One, two, dinner.

58:49.151 --> 58:50.277
Damn it!

58:50.986 --> 58:51.987
I missed.

59:04.207 --> 59:05.754
Is it 7:00 a.m. yet?

59:05.834 --> 59:07.461
It is somewhere.
(CHUCKLES)

59:15.218 --> 59:16.435
VIOLET: Cheers, everyone!

59:16.511 --> 59:18.229
Cheers!
Thanks for coming.

59:18.305 --> 59:20.603
It's so good to
see you guys, really.

59:20.682 --> 59:23.401
Yeah. Yes, you guys, too.

59:23.477 --> 59:27.448
So, here we've got some venison meat pie.
SUZIE: Mmm-hmm.

59:27.522 --> 59:29.866
And in the far corner
we have some venison marrow.

59:30.650 --> 59:33.620
And here we have some
forest-foraged vegetables,

59:33.695 --> 59:37.074
which I foraged myself.
So, enjoy.

59:37.157 --> 59:38.158
Mmm!
SUZIE: Yeah.

59:38.241 --> 59:40.960
And, honestly, eat as
much <i>as</i> you guys want.

59:41.036 --> 59:43.289
I have three deer
hanging in the garage.

59:43.371 --> 59:45.590
So, there's plenty
of meat to go around.

59:45.665 --> 59:47.212
Wow.

59:47.292 --> 59:48.635
TOM: Oh, my gosh,
how rude of me.

59:48.710 --> 59:50.383
Can I get anyone
some more mead?

59:51.171 --> 59:52.639
I've been collecting
the honey myself.

59:52.714 --> 59:55.593
Tom has become something
of an amateur beekeeper.

59:56.384 --> 01:00:00.230
It's just at the right stage of fermentation.
(SNIFFS) Here you go.

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:06.900
Drink as much
as you like.

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:11.741
I feel like I'm drinking
out of Chewbacca's dick.

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:17.911
Oh, wow.

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:20.788
That's just honey, huh?

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:23.586
That's really...
It's hurting my teeth.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:27.715
So, we're having a boy.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:30.135
Oh, my God!
Yeah!

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.678
Congratulations!
Yeah! Thank you!

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:33.096
That is amazing news.
One of each.

01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:35.261
A little prince. One of each,
so we're done, that's it.

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:36.804
Oh, I knew it!
SUZIE: So great.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.553
You were boobing out when you came in.
SUZIE: Yeah.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:40.637
Yeah.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.222
That is so exciting
for you guys.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.773
I couldn't be
happier for you guys.

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:44.850
Thank you.

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:47.311
I'm not sure that I ever
want to have kids.

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:49.775
What is it?

01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:53.942
I thought you had always wanted kids.
That's silly.

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:58.037
You know, sometimes the biggest
balls are the ones left unused.

01:00:58.113 --> 01:00:59.114
(CHUCKLES)

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:02.618
What the fuck
did you just say?

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.287
I don't know.
It's an expression.

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:08.624
Do you know what?
I have an idea.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.380
Tom and I are going to take
care of Vanessa tonight.

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:12.460
You two are
going to go out.

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:14.888
And I will prove to you
how fun children are, okay?

01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:17.057
Yes. Mmm-hmm.

01:01:17.465 --> 01:01:19.388
Yeah, I don't want
Vanessa to take part

01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:20.593
in one of her psychological
experiments.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.270
It's not an experiment.
SUZIE: I'm fine with it.

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.894
Yes, I am fine doing that.
I need a night out.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:26.395
You know what, we'll talk
about it and get back to you.

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:27.475
Done, done.
It's done. Come on.

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:28.856
SUZIE: Honey.
Honey?

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:31.108
(WHISPERING) Alex, I do.
You don't understand.

01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:32.446
Honey, come on. SUZIE: I
think we're doing it.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.115
He looks like a drifter.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.738
SUZIE: I don't care
if he's a psycho.

01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:38.115
You go out every night!
I need this.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:39.287
Look at him.
SUZIE: I never go out.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:40.579
I can hear you.

01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:42.453
SUZIE: Do this for me.
Do this for me.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.705
When we come back, she'll be
hanging on a hook in the garage.

01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:46.252
SUZIE: Come on. No.
ALEX: I'm telling you.

01:01:46.328 --> 01:01:47.454
SUZIE: We're doing it tonight.
Do this for me.

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.710
Well, it's decided,
we're going out!

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:50.836
All right!
All right.

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:52.133
SUZIE: We're doing it. Yeah.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.210
It's going to be fun.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:55.299
Put it on the other side.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.756
Like that? Should we try to
make another set of steps?

01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:58.806
I gotta go and pee.

01:01:58.924 --> 01:02:00.847
Can you just watch her for one second?
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:02.178
Okay.

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:07.065
How did this
go in together?

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.768
TOM: I don't know, but it kind of
looks like a train, doesn't it?

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:12.024
I'm going to
put this one here.

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:14.527
This is all I need.

01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:15.986
Totally.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:24.165
(LAUGHING)

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:26.534
Tom, where's Vanessa?

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:28.120
Babe, you have
got to see this.

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:29.671
Tom, where's Vanessa?
What?

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:30.838
Where is she?

01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:33.466
You have to keep
an eye on her.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:34.588
She was literally
just right here.

01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:36.762
Okay, but you got to
keep an eye, you know?

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.505
Okay, I'm sure she's right around here.
Vanessa?

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:41.307
Vanessa? Vanessa,
where are you?

01:02:41.383 --> 01:02:42.851
Oh, my God, Tom!

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:44.269
What are you
talking about? Whoa.

01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:47.143
What is your crossbow
doing on the kitchen table?

01:02:47.222 --> 01:02:48.644
A crossbow doesn't
clean itself, you know.

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:50.350
What is it doing there?

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.026
Hey.
Yeah.

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:54.605
Why don't you... Why don't we
come back out here and play?

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:56.447
No. I'm Pocahontas.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:03:00.198
(BOTH SCREAMING)
VIOLET: Oh, my God!

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:03.238
Oh, my God!

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:04.785
All right,
just get to the...

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:07.617
Oh, my God, it's in my leg!
Oh, my God, it's in my leg!

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:08.668
Oh, my God!

01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:09.790
(SCREAMING)
Stay calm! Stay calm!

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:10.836
Get it out!
Get it out of my leg!

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:11.913
Get it out of my leg!
Okay! Okay!

01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:13.339
I'm gonna pull it out!

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:14.548
No, no, no,
don't pull it out!

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:15.625
That'll ruin the meat.

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:17.131
It's not meat,
it's my leg!

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:18.553
I got it! Stay calm!
Get it out!

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.047
(SCREAMING)

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:22.891
That's really in there.
Oh, shit.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.802
Oh, my God!

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:27.516
My God.
Ugh!

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:28.642
Just put pressure on it.

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:29.723
What happened?

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.774
She shot me
with a crossbow.

01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:34.018
What?

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:36.905
I want to punch you in the face right now.
Do you understand that?

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.277
I think we should
all just...

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:40.279
My sister had an arrow
in her leg tonight, Tom!

01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:42.531
It's not an arrow,
it's a bolt.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:46.160
ALEX: Well, I guess we were totally wrong!
It's a bolt!

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:48.333
Oh, you're right. You know what,
we're in the wrong, here.

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:52.038
My daughter didn't just witness
herself nearly murdering her aunt!

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.667
There was blood
all over the place!

01:03:53.747 --> 01:03:56.796
She's up there freaking out right now!
She shit her pants!

01:03:57.417 --> 01:03:59.840
She hasn't shit her pants
in two or three months

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:01.796
and now she's up there,
shitting her pants!

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.929
She feels responsible for
injuring her aunt, who she loves!

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:07.389
You understand what
that does to a kid?

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:09.938
You don't! And you don't even give...
You don't care.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:11.765
It's a good thing you don't
want to be a father,

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.316
because you'd be
a terrible father.

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:17.817
And I don't like this. I don't
like this new "Lamb Chop" Tom!

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:21.942
You lost it, bro. Tether's
cut, you're in orbit.

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:24.069
You're out there.

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:27.205
God! I'm so sorry!

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:31.125
I'm sorry, but please
don't be so upset.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:32.961
At least nobody died.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:41.378
PRIEST: And Grandpa Baba's
last words were,

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:43.589
"I can't wait until
Violet's wedding."

01:04:53.598 --> 01:04:55.521
Okay, babe, I gotta go.
I'm really late.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.524
Okay. Mmm. Donuts. Are
you going to eat these?

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:00.105
No, but those are old.

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:02.031
And if you want to
just wait for a minute,

01:05:02.107 --> 01:05:03.859
I'll be back with
some fresh ones.

01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:05.944
Mmm!

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:11.662
These are fine. I didn't
have to wait at all.

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:16.167
Are you going
to get dressed today?

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:19.124
I think today is
more of a bunny day.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:20.671
Yeah.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.552
(PEOPLE TOASTING LOUDLY)

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:33.221
I have to say something.
I have to say something.

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:35.648
I just have to be, just for real.
I love you guys.

01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:37.475
ALL: Aw!
I love you guys.

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:40.108
This is a fucking great
department, all of you guys.

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:42.439
You guys are
the best co-workers.

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:45.901
Except Ming, I don't know. I
just don't think you respect me.

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:48.282
I don't think that
you've ever respected me.

01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:50.238
And I'm just not feeling it,
and I had to be honest.

01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:52.699
But to everyone else, to us!
VIOLET: Yeah!

01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:54.705
Whoo!

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:56.327
To everyone except Ming.

01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:57.958
DOUG: Except for Ming.
VIOLET: Sorry, Ming.

01:05:58.037 --> 01:05:59.084
DOUG: Oh, wow.

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:02.509
I want to give a toast.
I love all of you so much.

01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:06.638
You're my best friends. The best
friends anybody could ever ask for.

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:10.013
Except for you, Vaneetha.
I don't like you.

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:12.685
I don't like you.
You're a bitch.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.479
But I love all
of you so much!

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:17.728
I love all of you.

01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:19.475
You're the best!
DOUG: All right.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:22.062
Except for Vaneetha,
you're the best!

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:23.779
Calm down, Ming.

01:06:23.938 --> 01:06:25.190

01:06:43.374 --> 01:06:45.001
Listen, what
I want to know is,

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:48.338
why are professors in movies
always writing stuff,

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:50.173
equations and stuff,
on windows?

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:51.508
I don't know.
I don't get it.

01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:52.843
I don't get it, either.
I don't understand it.

01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:55.520
I don't get the fact that my
fiancé behaves like a freak.

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:57.848
These are not
things that I know.

01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:00.730
I mean, surely, you know,
in a university

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:03.903
you wouldn't be far
from a pen and paper,

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:06.527
or a computer,
or an overhead projector...

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:08.449
I feel like you're
not listening to me.

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:09.868
I feel like
you're not listening.

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:14.540
I'm trying to offload and
tell you my issues with Tom.

01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:17.333
Oh, shut up, will you?
Put a sock in it.

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:20.537
Why? I'm coming
to you as a friend.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.997
You're wallowing.
No, I'm not.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.206
Yes, you are.
I'm not wallowing.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:24.256
You are wallowing.

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:27.085
What do you know? You don't know
anything about relationships.

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:28.545
Well, all right,
I'll take that.

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:30.221
When I'm in a relationship,

01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:33.846
I'm a complete and
utter control freak.

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:35.890
Are you really? Are you really, though?
But that's not what...

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:37.767
It doesn't matter.
I'm surprised.

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:41.099
What we're talking about
now is your wallowing.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:42.274
I'm not wallowing.

to tell you that

I needed something
different tonight,

01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:46.275

Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

Okay, shut up, shut up, shut up.
This is amazing.

Mmm!

No! No, no, no.

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:07.255
What were we thinking? I mean, I
was wrong, obviously. Totally.

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:09.210
I'm with Tom.
Yeah.

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:10.420
I'm taken.
I know.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:12.301
I'm with Tom.
I apologize.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.677
I'm going to go find Tom.
I know that.

01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:16.426
It was a friend kissing a friend.
This was bad.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:18.636
I kissed you
and you kissed

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:20.562
your boss.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.312
Who are you texting?

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:24.688
I'm texting myself.

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:25.768
Yourself?

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:28.856
I am very drunk and I
will not remember this.

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:32.408
Hey, Tom!

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:34.615
Hey!

Hey, babe.
Hey.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:43.995
I've been looking for you.

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:45.170
You're drunk, sweetie.

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:46.292
No, I'm not.

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:47.749
And you didn't
come home last night.

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:51.426
VIOLET: I know, because I've been
thinking about stuff, and I just...

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:52.627
What have you
been thinking?

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:56.057
I love you,
and you love me.

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:59.139
And I just think that,
why on Earth

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:00.470
would we put it
off any longer?

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:01.679
Because... I'll tell
you why we put it off.

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:05.017
Because we both decided
we had too many problems

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:08.729
and we were going to put the wedding
off until things got better.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.987
<i>Which was dumb as balls.
That was so dumb, Tom.</i>

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:15.944
And I have been dumb,
saying that.

01:09:16.694 --> 01:09:19.743
Please, I just want
to marry you, Tom.

01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:24.419
Please?

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.380
Are you serious?
Yeah.

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:30.834
I'm so serious. I don't
know what we've been doing.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:34.841
I have no idea why we've been
putting it off and waiting

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:36.844
and shifting
and this and that,

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:38.765
and dicking around.
It's like...

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:43.100
I just love you so much.
Madly.

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:46.349
So badly, Tom.
I just want to...

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.603
I just want
to get married.

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:01.118
TARQUIN: Yeah,
that's super sanitary.

01:10:01.656 --> 01:10:04.500

to puke?

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:13.672
Oh, shit.

01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:17.968

fucking eat it?

01:10:21.008 --> 01:10:22.055
Ugh.

01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:23.978

01:10:37.275 --> 01:10:38.618
Sorry, Tarquin.

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:43.324
You know, that would have been way less
gross if you'd just puked everywhere.

01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:47.415
All we have available that
weekend is our accordionist.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:50.246
I love accordion. Great.
Me, too.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:53.667
The Chos never made it to the altar,
so you can have this one for cheap.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.002
Awesome.
Great.

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:58.213
And if you don't have a venue, my
brother Randy has a barbeque joint.

Oh, sweet.
Perfect.

Yeah, it <i>says,</i>
"I don't read Korean."

All right,
I was just asking.

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:11.021

I think I love it.

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:21.694
Should we just book this place for
the rehearsal dinner as well?

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:22.779
Yes.
Great.

01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:23.863

I can't believe it.
It's finally here.

Winton kissed me.

01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:08.332
What?
It meant nothing.

He was drunk and he didn't
mean what he was doing, Tom.

It was a stupid mistake.

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:19.547
He was drunk.

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:21.220
He's not coming
tomorrow night.

01:12:21.295 --> 01:12:23.343
No, he's not.
I will tell him that.

01:12:25.383 --> 01:12:27.852
This will never,
ever happen again.

01:12:28.469 --> 01:12:29.812
I promise.

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:32.056

hadn't told me that.

Yes.

01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:52.910
It's going to happen.

01:12:52.994 --> 01:12:55.167

No.
He kissed me, Tom!

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:37.421
Okay, you know what'?
That is a cop out.

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.378
That is not fair.

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:42.210
Yes, he may have been
the one who kissed you,

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:46.176
but there is a reason that he
felt like that was an option.

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:49.718

Okay, no, you want to know something?
For the record,

01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:06.325
I did fake that orgasm.

01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:10.576
And I bet you probably couldn't even tell.
That's right.

is a real mitzvah.

their children
in the Jewish faith,

Zionist struggle against the Arab.

in Port-au-Prince.

01:38:31.364 --> 01:38:32.866
I've had tacos
in Buenos Aires.

01:38:32.949 --> 01:38:34.872
I've even had
tacos in Guatemala.

01:38:34.951 --> 01:38:37.795
These are the best motherfucking
tacos I have ever had.

01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:40.248
You're a white guy.
You make tacos like a Mexican.

01:38:40.957 --> 01:38:41.958
Thanks.

01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:43.376
Give me a hug.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:44.961
Oh, really?

01:38:45.044 --> 01:38:47.012
Give me a hug, now!

01:38:47.171 --> 01:38:48.764
All right.

01:38:49.006 --> 01:38:51.134
Mmm! You smell like a taco.

01:38:51.843 --> 01:38:54.096
Okay, can we get
those tacos ready?

01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:57.732
As you know, we have a sufficiency
of qualified candidates

01:38:57.807 --> 01:39:00.230
for a position in
your department,

01:39:00.309 --> 01:39:02.778
but you got it.
Congratulations.

01:39:03.396 --> 01:39:08.027
You're being promoted to assistant
professor, tenure track. Congratulations.

01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:09.656
Holy shit!

01:39:09.735 --> 01:39:10.987
(LAUGHING)

01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:15.454
Sorry, that was really
inappropriate, it's just...

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.834
Shoot, I am so thrilled.
Thank you.

01:39:19.996 --> 01:39:21.873
Congratulations.
Professor Walch.

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:24.050
Bravo, bravo.
Thank you, Professor.

01:39:24.125 --> 01:39:25.342
Fudge.

01:39:27.044 --> 01:39:28.136
Wonderful.

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:35.636
Doug?

01:39:36.387 --> 01:39:37.559
Hey.

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:39.265
Heard your news.
Congratulations.

01:39:39.348 --> 01:39:40.725
Thanks.
Yeah.

01:39:41.142 --> 01:39:42.143
Where are you going?

01:39:42.477 --> 01:39:45.651
Uh... On my way to
University of North Dakota.

01:39:46.606 --> 01:39:49.155
Oh! Well, that's good.

01:39:49.233 --> 01:39:51.702
Yeah. No, no, it's great.
I'm excited.

01:39:51.903 --> 01:39:53.246
I'm going to be a pioneer.

01:39:53.321 --> 01:39:55.915
I'm going to be the first
black guy to freeze to death.

01:39:56.073 --> 01:39:58.246
It's going to be cool.
Yeah, I'm pumped up about it.

01:39:58.326 --> 01:39:59.327
Cool.
Yeah.

01:39:59.410 --> 01:40:02.004
It's just like that song.
I get knocked down,

01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:04.548
except I get up
again in North Dakota,

01:40:04.624 --> 01:40:06.217
which is the worst
place on Earth.

01:40:06.584 --> 01:40:08.052
I'm sorry.

01:40:08.127 --> 01:40:09.754
You know what? I'm overreacting.
It's going to be great.

01:40:09.921 --> 01:40:13.050
And I couldn't keep up with you and Winton.
I couldn't compete, so...

01:40:13.257 --> 01:40:15.351
(SCOFFS)
What do you mean by that?

01:40:16.761 --> 01:40:18.434
I mean, come on,
you know what I mean.

01:40:19.222 --> 01:40:20.223
I don't.

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:22.020
You know what I mean.

01:40:23.351 --> 01:40:26.195
Yeah, well, it's not
really like that.

01:40:27.355 --> 01:40:29.403
Uh... No, it's a fact.

01:40:30.858 --> 01:40:33.407
Yeah, well, that's not
why I got the...

01:40:34.028 --> 01:40:35.280
Ah. A little bit.

01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:37.031
Okay.

01:40:44.247 --> 01:40:45.294
VIOLET: Hey.

01:40:45.373 --> 01:40:47.467
Hey. Here she is.

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:54.056
<i>So, congratulations.</i>

01:40:54.131 --> 01:40:55.132
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:57.977
She got the job? Motherfucker!
Shh!

01:40:58.052 --> 01:40:59.770
It's very exciting.

01:41:02.265 --> 01:41:04.188
How long do you think
I have to decide,

01:41:04.267 --> 01:41:06.065
you know, whether
to take it or not?

01:41:06.769 --> 01:41:08.442
Sorry, I don't
understand the question.

01:41:08.604 --> 01:41:09.821
Oh, the position.

01:41:09.897 --> 01:41:11.319
I'm just wondering how
long I've got to decide

01:41:11.399 --> 01:41:13.322
on whether
I should take it.

01:41:13.401 --> 01:41:15.995
Well, you have to take it.
You've got no choice.

01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:18.789
Can I ask you something?

01:41:18.990 --> 01:41:19.991
Yeah.

01:41:20.241 --> 01:41:22.039
Did I get the job
because I deserved it

01:41:22.118 --> 01:41:23.961
or did I get it because you're
trying to keep me here?

01:41:24.245 --> 01:41:25.918
You got it because
you deserved it.

01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:28.841
Okay. So, I was
the strongest candidate.

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:29.963
Of course you were.

01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:31.673
Okay, we should
not be watching this.

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:33.095
You're right,
we shouldn't.

01:41:33.170 --> 01:41:35.764
<i>WINTON: I mean, these things
are inherently subjective,</i>

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:38.267
but I certainly feel that
we made the right choice, yes.

01:41:38.634 --> 01:41:40.636
I think I just need
you to say "yes" or "no"

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:42.814
as to whether I was
the strongest candidate.

01:41:42.888 --> 01:41:45.186
Well, why does it
matter so much?

01:41:45.266 --> 01:41:48.065
Because it matters to me. You know,
I want to deserve to be here.

01:41:48.144 --> 01:41:49.270
Was I the best?

01:41:49.437 --> 01:41:51.815
Who's to say who's
the best or the worst?

01:41:51.981 --> 01:41:53.358
I'm better than she is.

01:41:53.441 --> 01:41:55.944
No, you're not. It goes
Violet, me, you, then Doug.

01:41:56.027 --> 01:41:58.655
<i>What do these
labels even mean?</i>

01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:01.624
Look, just answer me.
Did I deserve the job

01:42:01.699 --> 01:42:03.576
or did I get it because you're
trying to keep me here?

01:42:03.659 --> 01:42:04.956
It's very simple, Winton.

01:42:05.328 --> 01:42:07.080
Violet, why don't
you trust me?

01:42:07.163 --> 01:42:09.291
If you make me answer
that question,

01:42:09.373 --> 01:42:11.876
you're violating our
unspoken agreement of faith.

01:42:12.084 --> 01:42:13.210
What does that mean?
What are you talking about?

01:42:13.294 --> 01:42:15.137
Well, the question
itself is an accusation.

01:42:15.212 --> 01:42:19.058
And I, personally, refuse to
answer an illogical question.

01:42:19.717 --> 01:42:20.889
Thanks, Spock.

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:22.060
Spock.

01:42:22.136 --> 01:42:23.888
That's a good one. Yeah.
That's a good one.

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:26.815
I mean, it seems that your refusal
to answer means that it's true.

01:42:27.308 --> 01:42:29.151
I'll tell you who's the best.

01:42:35.483 --> 01:42:36.450
Ming.

01:42:36.525 --> 01:42:37.993
Yes! I knew it.

01:42:38.194 --> 01:42:39.366
(IN SING-SONG) I'm the
best, I'm the best.

01:42:39.445 --> 01:42:41.368
What the fuck?

01:42:41.822 --> 01:42:43.244
Ming is the best.

01:42:43.324 --> 01:42:44.951
<i>VIOLET: So, you cheated
to get me the job.</i>

01:42:45.034 --> 01:42:48.755
So what if I cheated to get the
woman I love to stick around?

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:49.921
I have a question.

01:42:49.997 --> 01:42:51.920
Would you have even considered
my donut experiment

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:53.171
if Doug had suggested it?

01:42:53.542 --> 01:42:54.589
Of course not.

01:42:54.752 --> 01:42:55.844
(SCOFFING)

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:56.967
WOW!

01:42:58.172 --> 01:42:59.890
Wow.
Okay.

01:43:02.259 --> 01:43:04.307
In a way, Ming, it's like
their whole relationship

01:43:04.387 --> 01:43:06.435
was the donut experiment.

01:43:06.514 --> 01:43:08.016
Nice.
Thank you.

01:43:08.391 --> 01:43:10.018
Fine, fine, fine.

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:14.613
There will be new
students next year.

01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:16.066
There's always a new Violet.

01:43:17.733 --> 01:43:19.280
Oh, no!
Oh!

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.737
VANEETHA: He did not.

01:43:20.861 --> 01:43:21.862
Um...
Oh.

01:43:21.946 --> 01:43:24.449
This was...
Yeah.

01:43:24.532 --> 01:43:25.624
Oh, my God!

01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:28.374
<i>VANEETHA: Turn off the light. Turn
off the light, turn off the light.</i>

01:43:29.704 --> 01:43:31.001
Violet.

01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:24.138
These pancakes are delicious.
Mmm.

01:44:24.508 --> 01:44:27.182
They put a cinnamon glaze.
They're dreamy.

01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:28.387
You shouldn't
be eating them.

01:44:28.471 --> 01:44:29.518
It's good.

01:44:29.597 --> 01:44:32.225
It's why we're here.
We're here to eat, right?

01:44:32.308 --> 01:44:33.355
So, um,

01:44:34.727 --> 01:44:37.276
how about Violet?
How is she doing?

01:44:37.813 --> 01:44:39.781
I don't know. You know?

01:44:39.857 --> 01:44:41.609
She still with
that professor guy?

01:44:41.692 --> 01:44:43.444
I don't know.

01:44:43.527 --> 01:44:45.200
CAROL: What are you doing?

01:44:45.279 --> 01:44:46.781
What are you doing, Tom?

01:44:47.281 --> 01:44:49.454
I'm just... I'm trying
to eat my breakfast, Ma.

01:44:49.533 --> 01:44:53.254
I mean with Violet, and you know it.
Three grandparents are gone.

01:44:53.329 --> 01:44:57.050
Your grandparents, long gone. You
know who goes next, don't you?

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:59.172
Us. We go next.
Jesus, Dad.

01:44:59.251 --> 01:45:01.049
Please don't do this, guys.

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:02.880
He's not kidding.
Not kidding.

01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:04.636
He's on three different
heart medications.

01:45:04.715 --> 01:45:06.308
That's right. Three of them.
Mmm-hmm.

01:45:06.383 --> 01:45:08.385
What are you talking about?
Since when?

01:45:08.469 --> 01:45:10.016
Since my last
heart attack.

01:45:10.846 --> 01:45:13.065
Dad, you had a heart attack?
(SIGHS)

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:14.733
I had two, actually.

01:45:14.809 --> 01:45:17.528
The last one was right
after Mom's cancer scare.

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:19.480
A cancer scare?
What are you...

01:45:19.647 --> 01:45:21.775
Why didn't you guys
tell me any of this?

01:45:21.857 --> 01:45:23.655
PETE: Well, we didn't
want to bother you.

01:45:23.734 --> 01:45:25.782
No. It wasn't your affair.

01:45:26.111 --> 01:45:28.864
Well, is there anything else
you guys haven't told me?

01:45:28.948 --> 01:45:30.245
Well, what else have we...

01:45:30.324 --> 01:45:32.577
There's a lot we haven't told you, darling.
We don't share everything.

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:33.627
Your mother was...

01:45:33.702 --> 01:45:35.750
She was briefly hospitalized
for emotional issues.

01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:36.831
Well, yes, that's true.

01:45:36.914 --> 01:45:37.915
Yeah.

01:45:38.332 --> 01:45:41.051
We told you we were in a
timeshare on Sanibel Island.

01:45:41.335 --> 01:45:43.929
Wait, you guys have gone
there, like, four times.

01:45:44.004 --> 01:45:47.850
Well, at least one of the
times, we weren't really there.

01:45:48.592 --> 01:45:51.641
I had vaginal reconstruction
surgery last year.

01:45:52.513 --> 01:45:54.265
PETE: That stuff
really works.

01:45:54.348 --> 01:45:57.352
And that's why we don't share
everything with our children.

01:45:59.687 --> 01:46:02.736
I think I understand why
I have communication issues.

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:04.533
Thank you.
Ma.

01:46:04.692 --> 01:46:06.569
Maybe you should slow down
on the Bloody Marys.

01:46:06.735 --> 01:46:07.861
I don't think
you need any more.

01:46:08.696 --> 01:46:09.913
Oh.
Let her have it.

01:46:10.281 --> 01:46:11.954
CAROL: You're going to
tell me what to do? No.

01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:12.999
Let her have a drink.

01:46:13.075 --> 01:46:15.954
I am going to ask you again.
What are you doing with Violet?

01:46:16.036 --> 01:46:18.038
You're being dumb.

01:46:18.122 --> 01:46:21.342
You are being so
fucking dumb, you idiot.

01:46:21.417 --> 01:46:23.340
You love Violet.
I love Violet,

01:46:23.419 --> 01:46:26.013
your father loves Violet
and you're letting her go?

01:46:26.088 --> 01:46:27.385
Fuck you, you dummy.

01:46:29.717 --> 01:46:30.809
Wow.

01:46:31.385 --> 01:46:33.854
(LAUGHING) Since when do
you talk like this?

01:46:33.929 --> 01:46:35.397
It's not funny, Tom.

01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:37.600
Okay, fine.

01:46:38.142 --> 01:46:39.359
What are you doing?

01:46:39.435 --> 01:46:41.108
Look, we're not 100%
right for each other.

01:46:41.186 --> 01:46:43.188
And so, there's
nothing to be said.

01:46:43.272 --> 01:46:45.445
CAROL: I got news
for you, moron,

01:46:45.608 --> 01:46:49.988
your father and I, we're not
even 90% right for each other.

01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.244
Not even 60, okay?
But he's the love of my life.

01:46:53.324 --> 01:46:55.577
And right now, the love of
your life is going to fly away

01:46:55.659 --> 01:46:58.003
and I bet somewhere in the back
of your mind, you're thinking

01:46:58.078 --> 01:47:00.206
that she'll always be there
if you want to try again,

01:47:00.289 --> 01:47:02.712
but you know what? She won't,
because she's the goddamned best!

01:47:02.791 --> 01:47:06.091
And some lucky guy is going to make
it work with her no matter what.

01:47:06.170 --> 01:47:09.845
Instead of settling for some
23-year-old airhead

01:47:09.924 --> 01:47:13.144
who probably doesn't know
who the fucking Beatles are.

01:47:19.642 --> 01:47:21.235
Had to be said.

01:47:22.686 --> 01:47:24.688
Hi, I missed you today.

01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:26.691
That's nice.

01:47:32.029 --> 01:47:33.030
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:34.956
Listen, I need to

01:47:35.741 --> 01:47:36.742
(SMACKS ups)

01:47:36.825 --> 01:47:39.578
talk to you about
something, Audrey.

01:47:42.456 --> 01:47:44.754
What's behind
those eyes, Tom?

01:47:46.627 --> 01:47:51.133
My ex-fiancée has
been on my mind a lot

01:47:51.799 --> 01:47:54.018
and I feel like that's
something I need to explore.

01:47:55.344 --> 01:47:57.267
Well, she's an old bitch!
There.

01:47:57.346 --> 01:47:59.815
I just explored it for you.
Done?

01:48:02.476 --> 01:48:04.570
(SOFTLY) It's hard to have
this conversation with you.

01:48:04.645 --> 01:48:06.238
You need to explore it, Tom?

01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:09.237
You were with her for five fucking years.
That's a really long time.

01:48:09.316 --> 01:48:10.659
What else is there
to learn about her?

01:48:10.818 --> 01:48:12.411
(GROWLS) Oh, God!

01:48:12.486 --> 01:48:13.908
I don't really know
the answer to that,

01:48:13.988 --> 01:48:15.410
but I just think
I need to find out.

01:48:15.489 --> 01:48:17.583
What are you thinking?
You're so stupid.

01:48:17.658 --> 01:48:19.752
You're so stupid.
You're going to leave me?

01:48:19.827 --> 01:48:21.170
You're going to leave this?

01:48:21.245 --> 01:48:24.670
For saggy tits and
a loose vagina? Really?

01:48:25.416 --> 01:48:26.838
Oh, God!

01:48:28.335 --> 01:48:29.928
I'm sorry to do this to you.

01:48:30.004 --> 01:48:31.426
Shut the fuck up.

01:48:31.505 --> 01:48:33.883
You know what?
You should just go, Tom.

01:48:33.966 --> 01:48:37.266
Just go. Go have fun.
Have fun with your old woman.

01:48:37.344 --> 01:48:39.062
Go fucking read
at night together.

01:48:39.138 --> 01:48:40.685
You can go through
menopause together.

01:48:40.764 --> 01:48:42.766
And you can go get
your little prostates checked.

01:48:42.850 --> 01:48:44.944
Check each other
for lumps all the time

01:48:45.019 --> 01:48:47.021
and do those kinds
of things together.

01:48:47.104 --> 01:48:50.278
And then go get some Crocs,
so your back doesn't hurt.

01:48:50.357 --> 01:48:52.280
And then you can
go walk on the beach

01:48:52.359 --> 01:48:55.454
and fuck each other with
your gross, wrinkly balls.

01:48:55.696 --> 01:48:58.449
That's another thing.
You're getting fucking fat.

01:48:58.866 --> 01:49:00.960
It's really hard to
have sex with someone

01:49:01.035 --> 01:49:03.129
when you can't breathe
underneath them.

01:49:03.203 --> 01:49:06.628
Can't breathe! Like, I feel like
I'm going to die every time.

01:49:06.707 --> 01:49:07.959
(SIGHS)

01:49:08.042 --> 01:49:11.342
You should leave.
I'm going to say mean things.

01:49:14.590 --> 01:49:15.716
(SOFTLY) Bye

01:49:16.633 --> 01:49:17.634
(BABY WAILING)

01:49:17.718 --> 01:49:19.891
PRIEST: He makes me lie
down in green pastures

01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:22.439
and leads me
beside still waters.

01:49:23.098 --> 01:49:27.649
He shall refresh my soul and guide
me in the path of righteousness...

01:49:27.728 --> 01:49:29.605
You're my good one.
(WAILING LOUDLY)

01:49:30.564 --> 01:49:32.362
I am so mad, Alex,
when you say that.

01:49:32.441 --> 01:49:34.284
ALEX: At least I'm not
the one failing <i>as</i> a parent.

01:49:34.359 --> 01:49:35.861
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:49:35.944 --> 01:49:37.821
ALEX: Give him
a couple Vicodin.

01:49:42.159 --> 01:49:43.877
Wow. Hi.
Hi.

01:49:44.203 --> 01:49:45.921
Hello.
Hello, Gideon.

01:49:45.996 --> 01:49:47.748
Didn't expect
to see you.

01:49:47.998 --> 01:49:50.251
Just came to say
goodbye properly.

01:49:50.667 --> 01:49:52.590
To my grandmother or...

01:49:52.961 --> 01:49:56.511
Yeah. We actually grew pretty
close towards the end.

01:49:57.257 --> 01:49:58.258
Oh, yeah?

01:49:58.509 --> 01:50:01.513
So, how are you and Tom?
Any kids yet?

01:50:01.845 --> 01:50:02.846
Mmm...

01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:06.275
No. Tom and I split up
a little while ago, so...

01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:07.567
Oh! I'm sorry.

01:50:07.768 --> 01:50:09.270
It has been four
years, of course.

01:50:10.354 --> 01:50:11.355
Hmm?

01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:14.283
Nothing. I...
No, go on. What?

01:50:14.817 --> 01:50:16.945
"Four years, of course" what?
Doesn't make sense.

01:50:17.694 --> 01:50:19.537
That's what you do.

01:50:19.738 --> 01:50:23.709
Is it? Is it what I do? Well,
let me just tell you something.

01:50:23.909 --> 01:50:26.207
Tom and I split up
because it wasn't working.

01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:28.163
Not because we weren't perfect
enough for each other.

01:50:28.247 --> 01:50:30.545
Not because I had him
on a four-year timeline.

01:50:30.707 --> 01:50:31.799
Okay'? So don't...

01:50:31.875 --> 01:50:33.127
Um...

01:50:33.210 --> 01:50:34.427
This is my daughter.

01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:36.296
Sorry.

01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:37.427
She's four.

01:50:37.714 --> 01:50:39.387
This is what
four looks like.

01:50:40.509 --> 01:50:42.807
Hello.
What's your name?

01:50:42.886 --> 01:50:44.229
Violet.

01:50:46.098 --> 01:50:47.771
Regret calling her
that now.

01:50:48.058 --> 01:50:50.902
Keep meaning to changed it,
but it's a lot of paperwork.

01:50:51.687 --> 01:50:52.984
And I don't want
to confuse her.

01:50:54.314 --> 01:50:56.908
Come on, darling. Let's go
and look at the coffin.

01:51:14.251 --> 01:51:15.468
Tom.

01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:19.048
Hi.

01:51:21.133 --> 01:51:23.056
I'm just realizing now, it
might be totally inappropriate

01:51:23.135 --> 01:51:24.682
for me to just
show up like this

01:51:24.761 --> 01:51:26.604
but Alex and Suzie
told me what happened.

01:51:26.763 --> 01:51:29.107
I'm so sorry about
Grandma Katherine.

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:32.945
She was sort of the only person in
your family who was ever nice to me.

01:51:34.062 --> 01:51:36.861
And I just felt
like I should come.

01:51:38.108 --> 01:51:40.406
But if that's inappropriate,
or weird at all,

01:51:40.485 --> 01:51:42.032
I can totally go
back to the hotel

01:51:42.112 --> 01:51:44.160
or take a tour of the Tower
of London, or something.

01:51:44.239 --> 01:51:47.163
No, no, it's not.
It's...

01:51:48.744 --> 01:51:50.917
It's really nice
to see you.

01:51:52.289 --> 01:51:54.007
It's nice to
see you, too.

01:52:03.967 --> 01:52:05.435
(LAUGHS)

01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:30.044
So, what do we do now?
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:52:34.164 --> 01:52:37.293
Fall semester doesn't
start until August 14th.

01:52:37.709 --> 01:52:40.337
I know that this
sounds crazy,

01:52:41.838 --> 01:52:44.717
but why don't you just come
back to San Francisco with me?

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:48.555
You could see your sister and we could
spend a couple of weeks together.

01:52:49.805 --> 01:52:51.899
We don't have to worry
about what it means.

01:52:52.224 --> 01:52:54.477
Then we'll go
our separate ways.

01:52:54.643 --> 01:52:55.769
Okay.

01:52:56.561 --> 01:53:01.067
Just, separately, like, I think it's
time to take down the Wham! posters.

01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:02.651
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:53:08.949 --> 01:53:10.371
(INDISTINCT)

01:53:17.624 --> 01:53:18.716
Yeah?

01:53:19.042 --> 01:53:20.089
Whoo!

01:53:23.005 --> 01:53:24.348
Thank you.

01:53:27.342 --> 01:53:28.685
(LAUGHING)

01:53:57.372 --> 01:54:00.091
I'm getting all
pieces that are here.

01:54:00.167 --> 01:54:01.669
VIOLET: Here, use these ones.

01:54:02.127 --> 01:54:03.800
(TOY CLATTERS)
VIOLET: Oops! Ooh...

01:54:03.879 --> 01:54:05.426
We lost a tower.
SUZIE: Oh, no, the tower.

01:54:05.505 --> 01:54:06.631
VIOLET: That's it.

01:54:06.923 --> 01:54:10.143
So, you know I'm keeping Tom
company this week, right?

01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:11.636
Yeah.

01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.097
(LAUGHS)

01:54:13.263 --> 01:54:16.642
Alex keeps him company without
also having sex with him.

01:54:17.267 --> 01:54:18.439
I assume.

01:54:18.685 --> 01:54:20.153
What does that mean?

01:54:20.228 --> 01:54:22.401
Mommy, do Elmo voice.

01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:27.820
(MIMICKING ELMO) Elmo thinks you
should do what you feel is right.

01:54:28.028 --> 01:54:29.280
(LAUGHING)

01:54:29.363 --> 01:54:32.617
Well, I don't really know what I think is right.
I think I'm just...

01:54:32.741 --> 01:54:34.789
You know, time will
tell, I think.

01:54:35.619 --> 01:54:38.839
(MIMICKING ELMO) Elmo
thinks time will tell.

01:54:38.914 --> 01:54:40.712
Would you mind not
doing that Elmo voice?

01:54:40.791 --> 01:54:42.759
'Cause really, you're repeating
back what I'm saying.

01:54:42.834 --> 01:54:46.134
Honestly, (MIMICKING ELMO) Elmo thinks
you should shit or get off the pot.

01:54:46.213 --> 01:54:47.214
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:54:47.297 --> 01:54:49.220
Aunt Violet,
do Cookie Monster.

01:54:52.302 --> 01:54:55.647
(MIMICKING COOKIE MONSTER) Me think
that's a really rude thing to say, Elmo.

01:54:55.722 --> 01:54:56.814
(LAUGHING)

01:54:58.183 --> 01:55:02.905
Elmo say it been five years,
almost five years.

01:55:02.979 --> 01:55:04.606
You either love him,
or you don't.

01:55:04.689 --> 01:55:07.442
Me love him, but it's
very complicated.

01:55:07.609 --> 01:55:09.737
Cookie doesn't get
everything handed to him

01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:12.243
on a (WHISPERS) fucking
silver platter like Elmo.

01:55:12.948 --> 01:55:15.827
Cookie got the
career he wanted.

01:55:15.909 --> 01:55:18.628
Tom moved to Michigan
so Cookie could work.

01:55:18.703 --> 01:55:21.957
Okay. Elmo wanted
to be a kinesiologist

01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:26.591
and instead, Elmo is cleaning
puke off her shirt every day.

01:55:26.670 --> 01:55:29.674
Well, maybe as nice
as these little Elmos are,

01:55:29.756 --> 01:55:31.929
Elmo should have considered
using protection.

01:55:32.134 --> 01:55:35.229
"C" is for condom. That's
good enough for me.

01:55:35.554 --> 01:55:40.685
Elmo is very happy with
Elmo's little Elmos, okay?

01:55:40.767 --> 01:55:43.270
Elmo would just like
a break once in a while.

01:55:43.395 --> 01:55:44.567
Fine.
Elmo never gets a break.

01:55:44.646 --> 01:55:48.071
This is fine. But this is precisely
why Cookie wants to take the time

01:55:48.150 --> 01:55:51.029
to consider if he's picked
the right cookie for his life.

01:55:51.111 --> 01:55:54.035
Well, maybe Elmo thinks
there is no right cookie.

01:55:54.114 --> 01:55:56.287
You just pick one
and take a bite.

01:56:03.832 --> 01:56:05.175
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Sorry.

01:56:07.794 --> 01:56:10.638
(MIMICKING ELMO)
Elmo is sorry, too.

01:56:12.466 --> 01:56:13.467
(SIGHS)

01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:15.018
Whose was better?

01:56:15.594 --> 01:56:17.062
Mommy's better.

01:56:20.557 --> 01:56:24.812
(MIMICKING ELMO) The worst choice
you can make is no choice at all.

01:56:26.396 --> 01:56:30.117
Okay? Snack time!
Time for a snack.

01:56:30.859 --> 01:56:33.658
Huh? It's time
for a snack.

01:56:35.071 --> 01:56:36.163
(EXCLAIMING PLAYFULLY)

01:56:36.239 --> 01:56:39.038
My favorite! Just kidding.
I love you both.

01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:41.912
Come get a snack.

01:56:49.711 --> 01:56:51.258
What time is your flight?

01:56:51.338 --> 01:56:52.590
Um... 1235.

01:56:57.177 --> 01:56:59.521
This is stupid.
What are we doing?

01:56:59.596 --> 01:57:00.688
What do you mean?

01:57:00.764 --> 01:57:02.437
I drive a taco truck.

01:57:02.599 --> 01:57:05.944
Okay? I can work anywhere,
and it's just ridiculous.

01:57:07.521 --> 01:57:10.115
It's stupid for us
not to give this another shot.

01:57:11.107 --> 01:57:13.451
Because I love you so much.

01:57:14.444 --> 01:57:16.822
And I'm not going
to let you go.

01:57:17.197 --> 01:57:19.450
Do you remember
the day that we first met?

01:57:19.616 --> 01:57:22.039
The New Year's Eve party.

01:57:22.118 --> 01:57:23.461
Yeah, how can I forget?

01:57:27.374 --> 01:57:30.878
Do you remember how a year
later, we made that list

01:57:30.961 --> 01:57:32.838
of what our marriage
would be like?

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:35.223
We were going to have 50 kids.

01:57:35.298 --> 01:57:37.346
If I recall,
we settled on 25.

01:57:37.425 --> 01:57:39.268
We did settle on 25.

01:57:42.222 --> 01:57:43.565
That was so dumb.

01:57:43.974 --> 01:57:45.146
(LAUGHS)

01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.602
Okay, I'm going to need you
to pull off on this exit.

01:57:47.686 --> 01:57:48.778
Why?

01:57:49.062 --> 01:57:51.064
Just pull over on
this exit over here.

01:57:51.147 --> 01:57:52.114
No, we can just...

01:57:52.232 --> 01:57:53.484
Tom, you're going to miss it!
Quick. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:57:55.110 --> 01:57:56.703
What are you doing?
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:57:56.820 --> 01:57:58.914
It was just imperative that we
stopped at the exit. Well, why?

01:57:58.989 --> 01:58:01.162
Because I'm trying
to propose to you.

01:58:09.082 --> 01:58:11.255
I don't think that
we can figure out

01:58:11.334 --> 01:58:13.757
all of our problems
before we get married.

01:58:13.837 --> 01:58:17.011
And I'm pretty sure
we'll have some after.

01:58:17.090 --> 01:58:19.138
But I promise you that
I will just love you

01:58:19.217 --> 01:58:21.015
every step of the way.

01:58:21.094 --> 01:58:22.687
So, yes or no?

01:58:35.275 --> 01:58:38.324
I was going to re-propose to you
when we got to the airport.

01:58:38.653 --> 01:58:41.406
(LAUGHING) You were? Tom.

01:58:43.867 --> 01:58:45.210
Oh, Tom.

01:58:48.371 --> 01:58:49.372
(WHISPERS) I love it.

What do you say?

01:58:56.713 --> 01:58:58.886
What do you say?
I asked you first.

01:59:00.050 --> 01:59:02.974
You've made me, like, the
happiest girl in the world.

01:59:10.226 --> 01:59:13.901
Okay, I'm going to need you to
go off to Alamo Square now.

01:59:14.397 --> 01:59:15.398

01:59:19.903 --> 01:59:21.826
Don't think about it.
Just drive.

01:59:22.989 --> 01:59:24.411
Do you have, like,
a thing planned?

01:59:27.410 --> 01:59:29.208
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:39.844
Hey, what are you doing? Did you
come to pick up the receipts?

01:59:39.923 --> 01:59:40.924
Did you buy it?

01:59:41.007 --> 01:59:42.008
Yes, he bought it.

01:59:42.342 --> 01:59:43.844
I can't believe this.

01:59:43.927 --> 01:59:45.144
I told you he would.

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:46.267

Okay, we have some
fast decisions to make.

01:59:53.853 --> 01:59:57.198
Do you want a string quartet,
or a New Orleans brass band?

01:59:57.273 --> 01:59:59.275
What about synthesizer dude?

01:59:59.609 --> 02:00:01.828
VIOLET: Oh, I have no idea who that is.
He must have just shown up.

02:00:01.903 --> 02:00:03.701
Oh. New Orleans brass band.
