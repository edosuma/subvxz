00:56.705 --> 01:02.252
Amanonce said, "When you make
a friend, you take on a responsibility."

01:02.252 --> 01:04.962
That describes my friend,
Danny Barrett.

01:04.962 --> 01:06.674
When he invited me to lunch

01:06.674 --> 01:09.426
I should have known
there'd be strings attached.

01:09.426 --> 01:10.761
Excuse me, guys.

01:10.761 --> 01:13.389
Sorry. Sure. Go ahead.

01:14.932 --> 01:16.892
MacGyver, you're just in time.

01:16.892 --> 01:18.727
For what? You said lunch.

01:18.727 --> 01:21.313
Later, okay? You know
what's going on in here?

01:21.313 --> 01:23.482
A jewellery safe cracked like an egg.

01:23.482 --> 01:26.777
Another few million in stones
are gone, goodbye, you know?

01:26.777 --> 01:29.738
Same MO as heists in Dallas,
New Orleans, Chicago.

01:29.738 --> 01:33.784
Who's getting hit in the pocket book?
My client, Pacific Metropolitan.

01:33.784 --> 01:35.869
But I know who's pulling the heists.

01:35.869 --> 01:38.956
I've been tracing this guy
halfway across the country.

01:38.956 --> 01:41.458
He leaves town after.
No strain, no pain.

01:41.458 --> 01:43.669
Nobody hot on his tail,
and know why?

01:43.669 --> 01:46.213
Because the thief
is a diplomat. Yeah.

01:46.213 --> 01:49.049
The Ganubian cultural attaché.
I'll bet a Porsche

01:49.049 --> 01:51.051
the diamonds are in the consulate.

01:51.051 --> 01:52.427
- Danny!
- What?

01:52.427 --> 01:55.347
You're an insurance investigator.
This is heavy.

01:55.347 --> 01:57.182
Have you talked to the police?

01:57.182 --> 01:59.059
Sure, and wave bye
to my Porsche.

01:59.059 --> 02:01.895
Which I'll buy with the bonus I get
when I get proof.

02:01.895 --> 02:04.814
- Which is why I asked you here.
- How'd I get so lucky?

02:04.814 --> 02:07.984
You taught me everything I know
about computer hacking.

02:07.984 --> 02:10.904
What's computer hacking
got to do with diamonds?

02:10.904 --> 02:14.824
I figured the consulate computer
had files on this cultural attaché.

02:14.824 --> 02:16.743
I figured out a way into it.

02:16.743 --> 02:19.621
I don't think that's a good idea.
It's kinda dumb.

02:19.621 --> 02:21.164
No, it was brilliant.

02:21.164 --> 02:24.501
When I accessed the menu
and punched up the attaché's name,

02:24.501 --> 02:27.420
the thing lit up.
Diamonds, dates of shipments.

02:27.420 --> 02:28.671
Wait a minute.

02:28.671 --> 02:31.841
Some thief put all that information
into a computer?

02:31.841 --> 02:35.345
Arrogance. To him it was just
good record keeping, you know?

02:35.345 --> 02:37.722
Who's gonna touch him?
He's a diplomat.

02:37.722 --> 02:41.809
All right, look. What exactly
was in the computer?

02:41.809 --> 02:43.978
I got a quick look,
then I got shut out.

02:43.978 --> 02:47.273
That's an intercept program.
They're probably on you.

02:47.273 --> 02:50.693
No way. I need your help to hack
my way back into the computer.

02:50.693 --> 02:54.030
My computer is set up
to receive the information.

02:54.030 --> 02:57.492
I have the code word that gets me
into his program: blue ice.

02:57.492 --> 03:00.078
Danny!

03:00.411 --> 03:02.997
No!

03:06.793 --> 03:09.420
Blue ice.

03:35.821 --> 03:41.202
Our senior year, class voted
Danny the most reckless...

03:43.037 --> 03:48.000
...and the most irresponsible,
but everybody loved him.

03:49.919 --> 03:52.046
I'm gonna nail them, Pete.

03:52.046 --> 03:54.089
The diamond thief did this.

03:54.089 --> 03:56.759
You know it, I know it,
and I'm gonna nail him.

03:56.759 --> 03:58.677
MacGyver, wait a minute.

03:58.677 --> 04:01.013
Walk away from this
for a couple of days.

04:01.013 --> 04:02.556
Let the police handle it.

04:02.556 --> 04:05.100
That truck didn't have
license plates on it.

04:05.100 --> 04:08.771
The police are calling it
a hit and run.

04:08.771 --> 04:11.190
Help me on this, Pete.

04:11.190 --> 04:13.525
Well, I can't say no, can I?

04:13.525 --> 04:14.902
Where do we start?

04:14.902 --> 04:17.613
The name of the Ganubian
cultural attaché.

04:17.613 --> 04:20.240
His name is Amir Sumal.

04:20.240 --> 04:23.827
He has quite a reputation
for his brutal way of doing things,

04:23.827 --> 04:27.789
both in politics and his personal life.
A dangerous man.

04:27.789 --> 04:31.919
He's hosting a reception
for the city's wealthiest art patrons,

04:31.919 --> 04:36.632
but access is a tough nut to crack.
Nobody gets in without an invitation.

04:36.632 --> 04:39.468
Step inside. Invitation, please.

04:55.650 --> 04:58.487
Step inside. Invitation, please.

04:59.488 --> 05:02.073
Step inside.

05:10.790 --> 05:13.001
Oh, my darling!

05:13.001 --> 05:15.712
I haven't seen you since Cannes,
or Mallorca?

05:15.712 --> 05:18.506
Oh, yes, I think it was Mallorca.
How silly of me.

05:18.506 --> 05:22.010
You will save me a dance,
won't you?

05:22.761 --> 05:26.973
Pete had learned that Sumal's office
was located upstairs.

05:26.973 --> 05:29.684
The computer had to be there.

05:42.155 --> 05:47.785
Sumal was at the party, so what
I needed was a way upstairs.

06:29.535 --> 06:32.580
- Amir Sumal!
- Excuse me.

06:32.747 --> 06:36.125
What a pleasure, I've been
looking forward to meeting you.

06:36.125 --> 06:38.878
Thank you for coming.
I meant to ask you.

06:38.878 --> 06:43.007
Your magnificent necklace,
is it an heirloom?

06:58.355 --> 07:01.275
I'm sorry, staff only.

09:04.939 --> 09:08.401
Easy, easy. Take it easy,
I want to make a deal with you.

09:08.401 --> 09:11.821
If you don't scream,
I don't scream.

09:11.821 --> 09:15.783
How about that? Okay?
Can I trust you?

09:15.950 --> 09:19.036
All right, I want you to turn around,

09:19.036 --> 09:21.998
very, very slowly.

09:25.418 --> 09:27.587
All right! Who are you?

09:27.587 --> 09:30.089
It'll come to me.

09:30.089 --> 09:33.676
- What have you got in your bag?
- Just this.

09:33.676 --> 09:35.678
Now, who are you?

09:35.678 --> 09:37.972
Do we really need the gun?

09:37.972 --> 09:40.474
Just answer the question.
I'm impatient.

09:40.474 --> 09:42.685
All right. You want the truth?

09:42.685 --> 09:45.813
I'm somebody who shouldn't be here.

09:45.813 --> 09:48.441
Like you, I bet.

09:53.195 --> 09:55.406
What are you doing here?

09:55.406 --> 09:57.908
Oh. Hello.

09:57.908 --> 10:01.620
Obviously we were looking
for a little privacy.

10:01.620 --> 10:06.292
Yes. My fiancée here,
she's a little old-fashioned

10:06.458 --> 10:10.254
about public displays of affection.
Aren't you, dear?

10:10.254 --> 10:15.676
Move from behind the desk.
And lift your hands in the air.

10:16.594 --> 10:18.345
This is embarrassing.

10:18.345 --> 10:21.515
Croce here. I need some
backup in the library.

10:21.515 --> 10:24.601
Oh, now, really. Please.

10:25.269 --> 10:29.022
Mr Sumal would be outraged
to see how you were treating guests.

10:29.022 --> 10:30.607
- Move!
- Wait.

10:30.607 --> 10:34.945
Look, we're not really guests.
We're actually working undercover.

10:34.945 --> 10:38.365
In fact, her gun is right over there.

10:42.494 --> 10:45.372
- Where'd you learn that?
- Sunday school.

10:45.372 --> 10:47.958
Oh.

10:59.469 --> 11:04.850
- What are you doing?
- Finishing up what I started to do.

11:15.318 --> 11:18.071
- Croce?
- Outside.

11:18.238 --> 11:19.781
Croce, are you in there?

11:19.781 --> 11:23.827
If you think you can rappel
in that outfit.

12:17.630 --> 12:20.967
What's she doing?
That chick is a real banana boat.

12:20.967 --> 12:24.595
Pulls up in a Ferrari,
leaves in a wagon?

12:24.595 --> 12:26.722
I hate when she does that.

12:26.722 --> 12:31.936
It's all right, we made a trade.
I'll take care of it.

13:34.081 --> 13:38.710
Well, isn't this interesting how we run
into each other twice in one day.

13:38.710 --> 13:41.547
Let me guess, you're
an insurance investigator.

13:41.547 --> 13:43.340
What else?

13:43.340 --> 13:45.467
Danny sure could pick 'em.

13:45.467 --> 13:48.387
I'll take that as a compliment.

14:03.819 --> 14:06.738
I thought you might have
modem'd that.

14:06.738 --> 14:09.449
Yeah, but it's all scrambled.

14:11.368 --> 14:14.079
I know this is a
multi-syllabic binary code,

14:14.079 --> 14:17.624
and that the Ganubians
use it all the time.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.669
Fact is, I have a decoding
programmer disk in my car.

14:20.669 --> 14:24.339
Why don't you get it, and we can
unscramble this mess together.

14:24.339 --> 14:27.092
I believe you have my keys.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.932
Allow me.

14:41.815 --> 14:44.442
Be right back.

14:50.073 --> 14:51.825
Put your hands on the car.

14:51.825 --> 14:54.744
- Let's go, you know the routine.
- What's going on?

14:54.744 --> 14:57.163
You're under arrest
for grand theft auto.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.707
Grand theft? Hold it.
Let me explain this.

14:59.707 --> 15:02.794
Keep your hands on the car
and do what you're told.

15:02.794 --> 15:05.713
I've got identification.
This is not a stolen car.

15:05.713 --> 15:07.632
Oh, this is your car?

15:07.632 --> 15:09.801
- Well, no, not exactly.
- Well, no.

15:09.801 --> 15:11.302
Save it, lowlife.

15:11.302 --> 15:14.222
The owner called it in,
described you to a tee.

15:14.222 --> 15:17.433
- The owner?
- That's what I said.

15:17.475 --> 15:20.019
So, would you like to try a new story?

15:20.019 --> 15:22.647
I love a good story.

15:24.148 --> 15:26.317
You have the right to remain silent.

15:26.317 --> 15:28.986
If you give up the right,
anything you say

15:28.986 --> 15:31.989
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

15:31.989 --> 15:36.369
You have the right to speak
with an attorney...

15:49.924 --> 15:52.510
Wow.

15:53.844 --> 15:55.680
Diamond grades.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.265
Yes, yes, yes.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.149
So you're MacGyver?

16:07.149 --> 16:08.609
Yeah. How'd you know?

16:08.609 --> 16:11.070
Oh, the police told me.

16:11.070 --> 16:14.114
I wanna compliment you
on that little story you told

16:14.114 --> 16:16.492
about the decoder disk.

16:16.492 --> 16:18.661
Nice touch. Good moves.

16:18.661 --> 16:20.996
You're not still mad about the car?

16:20.996 --> 16:22.539
Oh, I don't know.

16:22.539 --> 16:25.793
I had to drag one of my best friends
downtown to bail me out

16:25.793 --> 16:28.087
and then had to explain
the whole thing.

16:28.087 --> 16:29.713
Of course I'm ticked.

16:29.713 --> 16:33.050
Look, we kept bumping
into each other,

16:33.050 --> 16:35.427
and, well, sicing the cops on you

16:35.427 --> 16:38.764
was the fastest thing I could
think of to get you off my tail.

16:38.764 --> 16:41.392
I'm sorry about the car.

16:41.642 --> 16:43.685
I came here to apologize.

16:43.685 --> 16:48.107
You came here because
you can't break the code.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.985
You did?

16:53.529 --> 16:55.697
Maybe.

16:55.697 --> 16:59.409
You're gonna have to come up
with more than a lame apology.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.995
Danny was my brother.

17:03.080 --> 17:06.249
You're the one that grew up
with his father...

17:06.249 --> 17:07.459
...in Georgetown.

17:07.459 --> 17:10.587
Raised there, married there,
divorced there.

17:10.587 --> 17:12.464
That was another lifetime ago.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.092
Why didn't you just
say something to me?

17:15.092 --> 17:16.675
I had no idea who you were,

17:16.675 --> 17:20.972
I thought you were another one
of Danny's flaky friends.

17:20.972 --> 17:23.767
Look, I came here to find out
who killed him.

17:23.767 --> 17:26.435
And I figured I was better off
working solo.

17:26.435 --> 17:29.606
- You a cop?
- No.

17:29.773 --> 17:32.692
But I... I've had
that kind of training.

17:32.692 --> 17:36.655
Danny did mention that his sister
had gone to a law school,

17:36.655 --> 17:42.869
and worked for a Senate subcommittee
in Washington. Why'd you leave?

17:42.869 --> 17:46.247
Well, my heart wasn't in it anymore.

17:46.790 --> 17:51.169
So I figured I'd come back here
and see Danny.

17:51.336 --> 17:53.963
He was all I had.

17:55.423 --> 17:59.594
I tried to tell him he was in
way over his head.

17:59.594 --> 18:04.015
But he had his heart set
on breaking this case.

18:04.057 --> 18:06.684
He wanted to be...

18:07.519 --> 18:08.770
...important.

18:08.770 --> 18:11.648
Danny was important.

18:12.607 --> 18:15.235
Look...

18:17.362 --> 18:20.740
I know some things,
you know some things.

18:20.740 --> 18:22.784
What do you say
we put them together

18:22.784 --> 18:25.620
and show Mr Sumal
he can't get away with murder?

18:25.620 --> 18:28.247
I think I'd like that.

18:29.123 --> 18:31.250
I think I'd like it a lot.

18:31.250 --> 18:34.837
I don't know what you mean.
This is not proof. What is this?

18:34.837 --> 18:37.507
It's a list of the diamonds Sumal stole.

18:37.507 --> 18:41.010
Valuations, descriptions...
They're in that consulate.

18:41.010 --> 18:42.845
They haven't been shipped yet.

18:42.845 --> 18:45.765
They're sitting there,
ten million dollars worth.

18:45.765 --> 18:48.601
We can't get a search warrant,
it's foreign soil.

18:48.601 --> 18:51.729
Let's at least agree
on our dilemma, all right?

18:51.729 --> 18:54.273
Amir Sumal could commit murder.

18:54.273 --> 18:57.777
He could kill a nun
in Central Park at high noon,

18:57.777 --> 18:59.612
and we couldn't touch him.

18:59.612 --> 19:02.281
That's what diplomatic immunity means.

19:02.281 --> 19:06.369
The man is subject to the laws
of his own land, not ours.

19:06.369 --> 19:08.371
Most we could do is ship him home.

19:08.371 --> 19:10.081
But, in order to do that,

19:10.081 --> 19:13.209
we would have to catch this man
with the stolen diamonds,

19:13.209 --> 19:15.377
right in the palm of his hand.

19:15.377 --> 19:17.546
- Then let's do it.
- But how?

19:17.546 --> 19:21.258
Well, first we're gonna need
some diamonds for him to steal.

19:21.258 --> 19:25.054
Well, I have a diamond stick pin
I inherited. Probably worth $600.

19:25.054 --> 19:29.892
Where are we going to get diamonds
that he would want to steal?

19:29.892 --> 19:32.227
How about the code room
at the consulate?

19:32.227 --> 19:35.022
You wanna steal the diamonds
Sumal has stolen

19:35.022 --> 19:37.524
- so that he can steal them back?
- Right.

19:37.524 --> 19:41.487
From what we've been dug up,
this Sumal is an extremely arrogant guy.

19:41.487 --> 19:44.073
- He'd be a cinch to set up.
- It could work.

19:44.073 --> 19:46.784
He loves women,
playing squash, and diamonds.

19:46.784 --> 19:49.078
Pick the order, those are his passions.

19:49.078 --> 19:51.121
Great, but how are those passions

19:51.121 --> 19:54.666
going to get us into a secure
code room in a foreign consulate?

19:54.666 --> 19:55.918
Wait a minute.

19:55.918 --> 20:00.130
Diamonds, women, squash.

20:01.298 --> 20:03.926
Squash.

20:04.509 --> 20:07.054
He's got to carry the key
with him, right?

20:07.054 --> 20:11.266
So if I could get into his locker
at the Racquet Club...

20:11.266 --> 20:13.518
I could make a mould,

20:13.518 --> 20:16.396
to make a copy of our own key.

20:16.521 --> 20:19.441
Of course we're gonna need
some bait.

20:19.441 --> 20:22.027
What kind of bait?

20:23.737 --> 20:26.364
A diamond.

20:27.491 --> 20:30.452
A very big diamond.

20:41.379 --> 20:44.341
I'll be happy to double this
if you'd tell Mr Sumal

20:44.341 --> 20:49.346
he's at my regular table,
and please ask him to move.

20:52.766 --> 20:56.561
Excuse me, sir, but I'm afraid
you are sitting at a reserved table.

20:56.561 --> 21:00.065
- This is the lady's regular table.
- I beg your pardon?

21:00.065 --> 21:02.067
I'm sorry to trouble you to move.

21:02.067 --> 21:07.322
I will have a table cleared and set up
for you in a moment, Mr Sumal.

21:07.322 --> 21:09.949
My usual. Thank you.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.410
I hope you don't think I'm being rude.

21:12.410 --> 21:15.121
No. Just territorial.

21:15.288 --> 21:17.999
Oh, this is ridiculous.

21:18.750 --> 21:20.293
Won't you please join me?

21:20.293 --> 21:22.921
Come, sit down.

21:23.212 --> 21:25.548
Amir Sumal.

21:25.548 --> 21:28.468
Nicole. Nicole de Merlier.

21:29.927 --> 21:33.222
De Merlier? But of course.

21:34.098 --> 21:36.142
- I know the name.
- Oh?

21:36.142 --> 21:38.811
Everyone knows of
the Merlier diamonds.

21:38.811 --> 21:40.813
The famous Twelve Sisters.

21:40.813 --> 21:45.526
- It's a shame we must part with them.
- You're selling The Sisters?

21:45.526 --> 21:48.362
- Why?
- Oh, the usual. Money.

21:48.529 --> 21:51.532
My brother has inherited
the sins of our late father:

21:51.532 --> 21:53.701
expensive tastes
for wine and women.

21:53.701 --> 21:56.495
Your brother is
a well-known sportsman.

21:56.495 --> 22:00.791
Yes, actually, when he's not busy
entertaining. He lives for squash.

22:00.791 --> 22:04.420
Ridiculous game, though,
chasing that silly ball.

22:04.420 --> 22:06.839
It happens to be my favourite sport.

22:06.839 --> 22:09.508
- Oh, no, not really?
- Yes.

22:09.675 --> 22:11.510
I suppose I'm prejudiced.

22:11.510 --> 22:14.638
I'd like to change your mind.
This afternoon.

22:14.638 --> 22:17.141
I'm sorry. I have an appointment.

22:17.141 --> 22:20.728
Perhaps we can organize this
another time?

22:20.728 --> 22:23.314
I have this wonderful idea.

22:24.482 --> 22:27.610
I will accompany you
to your appointment,

22:27.610 --> 22:30.279
and then we'll lunch at my club.

22:30.279 --> 22:32.072
I'd like that.

22:32.072 --> 22:37.119
- And where is your appointment?
- The Diamond Exchange.

23:08.442 --> 23:11.069
Yes? Right.

23:12.404 --> 23:14.239
That's them. Places.

23:14.239 --> 23:16.867
Come on, move it. Let's go.

23:26.334 --> 23:28.754
Mr Blane, please forgive
my being late.

23:28.754 --> 23:31.256
- No problem.
- Well, it's about time.

23:31.256 --> 23:33.717
Let's not make this more difficult.

23:33.717 --> 23:37.596
Mr Blane, may I please introduce you
to a friend of mine, Amir Sumal.

23:37.596 --> 23:39.097
How do you do?

23:39.097 --> 23:41.641
My brother Claude.
The rogue of the family.

23:41.641 --> 23:44.686
- I'm here, aren't I? How you doing?
- Hello.

23:44.686 --> 23:47.063
I was telling your brother
we've spoken

23:47.063 --> 23:49.691
to our best contacts
about your collection,

23:49.691 --> 23:53.486
including the Vanderzeals,
and there is considerable interest.

23:53.486 --> 23:55.238
So, may I see the stone?

23:55.238 --> 23:57.824
Oh, yes, of course.

24:00.118 --> 24:02.746
Oh, wonderful.

24:09.586 --> 24:12.172
Such fire.

24:13.339 --> 24:15.925
No noticeable flaws

24:16.009 --> 24:19.721
and approximately 1 0.3 karats.

24:19.888 --> 24:22.932
The ninth sister of 1 2.

24:23.099 --> 24:25.268
We'll deposit this in the vault,

24:25.268 --> 24:27.520
and we'll wire a check to your bank.

24:27.520 --> 24:31.357
This is unbreakable glass,
of course.

24:31.524 --> 24:34.986
It means that our secure
viewing room and the vault

24:34.986 --> 24:38.156
are visible at all times.
Simpson?

24:41.034 --> 24:43.953
Our ultimate security precaution.

24:56.883 --> 25:00.928
They're gorgeous.
May I take a closer look?

25:02.430 --> 25:05.224
Well, that's a little bit
unusual, but...

25:05.224 --> 25:09.228
...since it's you,
Miss de Merlier, please.

25:10.688 --> 25:12.106
Thank you.

25:12.106 --> 25:15.401
This shipment is going to Tiffany's.

25:17.194 --> 25:21.532
And these are consigned
to the Winwood Gallery.

25:29.748 --> 25:31.417
We got a good price, Nikki.

25:31.417 --> 25:34.545
Have my share transferred
to the Melbourne account.

25:34.545 --> 25:36.964
- I'll be at a tournament there.
- Squash?

25:36.964 --> 25:38.632
It's his obsession.

25:38.632 --> 25:41.594
Distraction, my dear.
Merely a distraction.

25:41.594 --> 25:43.053
Do you play, Mr Sumal?

25:43.053 --> 25:47.391
In fact, I just invited your sister
to lunch at my club.

25:47.391 --> 25:50.102
Oh, how nice. How about
if I invite myself along?

25:50.102 --> 25:52.521
Maybe have a couple of games
before lunch.

25:52.521 --> 25:57.025
- Claude!
- I'll even buy, now that we have cash.

25:57.025 --> 25:59.486
Amir, do you mind?

25:59.486 --> 26:02.698
Delighted, my dear. Shall we?

26:18.630 --> 26:20.465
Shall we proceed to the game?

26:20.465 --> 26:24.177
May I have a brief word with
my brother before you destroy him?

26:24.177 --> 26:26.430
Family matters.

26:26.430 --> 26:29.057
I'll see you there.

26:29.766 --> 26:31.727
- Give me the key.
- Didn't get it.

26:31.727 --> 26:35.397
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean? I didn't get it.

26:35.397 --> 26:37.566
- I thought you were good.
- So did I.

26:37.566 --> 26:39.276
Now what do we do?

26:39.276 --> 26:41.695
- Locker number 1 2.
- What's that mean?

26:41.695 --> 26:44.739
It means, I play squash,
and you play Find the Key.

26:44.739 --> 26:47.242
Not me,
it's the men's locker room.

26:47.242 --> 26:49.828
MacGyver.

27:52.515 --> 27:57.520
Whatever happened to a good
old-fashioned bar of soap?

28:03.651 --> 28:08.656
- Do you mind if I borrow the soap?
- Oh. Not at all.

28:31.303 --> 28:33.931
Point, game and match.

28:42.189 --> 28:46.068
I got to admit, you sure know
how to make a good impression.

28:46.068 --> 28:49.989
This key's gonna work out fine.
You did a fair job.

28:49.989 --> 28:52.950
I got myself invited to
the Ambassador's Reception.

28:52.950 --> 28:55.619
Now I would hardly rate that
a "fair job".

28:55.619 --> 28:58.414
Okay. Fair plus.

28:59.123 --> 29:00.958
So, my plan?

29:00.958 --> 29:04.044
Actually, I've got a better idea.

29:06.213 --> 29:10.175
Your Rolls-Royce,
Amir's dumbwaiter.

29:37.786 --> 29:40.414
Nicole de Merlier.

30:25.959 --> 30:29.587
Your Excellency, I felt a small
reception would be appropriate.

30:29.587 --> 30:31.256
I can endure it, Amir,

30:31.256 --> 30:34.467
but in future, please,
let us tend to business.

30:34.467 --> 30:36.261
Amir, darling.

30:36.261 --> 30:38.680
Oh, Miss de Merlier,

30:38.680 --> 30:41.099
I'd like you to meet
Ambassador Vulnay.

30:41.099 --> 30:45.061
- Miss Nicole de Merlier.
- An honour, sir.

31:12.380 --> 31:15.007
This is wonderful!

31:15.049 --> 31:17.176
The impressionists have such style.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.303
And this Renoir...

31:19.303 --> 31:21.931
Nicole, you amaze me.

31:22.723 --> 31:25.351
I cherish beautiful things.

31:25.393 --> 31:29.230
Especially valuable ones.
Like this Degas.

31:30.231 --> 31:34.402
Or a thoughtful man who sends his
security people to see I arrive safely.

31:34.402 --> 31:36.570
Security?

31:36.570 --> 31:39.698
I saw him keep an eye on you, or us,

31:39.698 --> 31:43.118
at the café, then at
the Diamond Exchange.

31:43.118 --> 31:46.247
He escorted me to your front gate.

31:51.335 --> 31:53.712
Security?

31:53.712 --> 31:58.092
Call up the gate camera
on the gallery monitor.

32:18.445 --> 32:21.073
I feel very safe with you.

32:21.740 --> 32:26.787
Of course you are, my dear.
Shall we rejoin the party?

33:05.200 --> 33:07.535
A Sym-Com
variable combination lock.

33:07.535 --> 33:12.874
The kind that requires each button
to be punched only once.

33:12.874 --> 33:17.253
No key was gonna open that.
But I had an idea.

33:17.671 --> 33:19.464
If they used all six buttons,

33:19.464 --> 33:24.719
the chances of guessing the right
combination was about 720 to one.

33:24.719 --> 33:27.263
Narrowing down the odds
was a simple matter

33:27.263 --> 33:30.934
of bringing fingerprints
to the surface.

33:38.525 --> 33:41.027
Three buttons had fingerprints.

33:41.027 --> 33:44.322
That got the odds down
to one in six.

33:44.322 --> 33:47.784
Then it was a matter of running
through the six combinations

33:47.784 --> 33:50.411
until I got the right one.

34:00.296 --> 34:03.299
Math and science do prove useful.

34:42.170 --> 34:44.799
Out!

34:52.348 --> 34:55.266
Fortunately, the ambassador
leaves tonight.

34:55.266 --> 34:58.479
So we will have tomorrow to ourselves.

34:58.479 --> 35:01.982
Well, I think that sounds positively...

35:04.276 --> 35:08.155
...lovely. Amir, darling,
come here. Goodbye.

35:08.155 --> 35:12.659
And thank you for a perfectly
splendid afternoon.

35:13.243 --> 35:15.829
Amir, you're wicked.

35:15.996 --> 35:19.792
Now, now, now, you don't want
to keep the ambassador waiting.

35:19.792 --> 35:24.838
Somehow I just know we're going
to become much closer.

35:36.433 --> 35:39.436
In case you didn't know,
my country executes spies,

35:39.436 --> 35:42.064
Mr Keach, Charles Keach!

35:42.230 --> 35:44.650
I'm not a spy,
I'm a private investigator.

35:44.650 --> 35:47.611
I didn't mean any offence
to you or your country.

35:47.611 --> 35:51.698
But I do take offence.
First you invade my personal life,

35:51.698 --> 35:56.078
and you seem to have a fascination
for my friend Miss de Merlier.

35:56.078 --> 35:59.623
First off, her name isn't de Merlier.
It's Carpenter.

35:59.623 --> 36:02.834
Secondly, I'd hide
the family silver if I were you.

36:02.834 --> 36:05.670
- What?
- Your lady friend's a high-class thief.

36:05.670 --> 36:08.215
In the past month
she's pulled off two jobs.

36:08.215 --> 36:11.009
Cash and stones worth
about three mil.

36:11.009 --> 36:14.471
It's my guess you're being
set up for a hit.

36:14.471 --> 36:16.097
I don't believe this!

36:16.097 --> 36:20.352
She greased the maitre d' at the cafe.
Oh, that's classic!

36:20.352 --> 36:23.480
Got under your skin to get herself
inside the consulate.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.357
What did she do while here?

36:25.357 --> 36:30.236
Well, we talked, and we
looked at the art collection.

36:30.236 --> 36:32.655
She's an expert
on anything worth money.

36:32.655 --> 36:35.241
Art, jewellery, rare coins.

36:35.366 --> 36:38.578
The lady's got a lot of interests.

36:38.703 --> 36:42.957
You are in greater peril
than you think.

36:44.083 --> 36:47.712
- One of the Degas is missing.
- Bingo!

37:07.148 --> 37:10.067
Okay. All the gear's in the van.

37:10.067 --> 37:12.445
Pete's on his way to the consulate.

37:12.445 --> 37:14.781
There's just one question.

37:14.781 --> 37:16.949
Will it work?

37:16.949 --> 37:19.494
Are you having a problem
with my plan?

37:19.494 --> 37:22.622
Just one, it's not mine.

37:22.788 --> 37:25.374
So, what's the problem.

37:30.880 --> 37:34.258
- Where is it?
- My purse.

37:40.222 --> 37:41.932
Aw, Nikki, doggone it,

37:41.932 --> 37:44.060
you just couldn't leave it alone.

37:44.060 --> 37:46.645
Move.

37:51.066 --> 37:55.321
I had a very interesting discussion
with a Mr Charles Keach.

37:55.321 --> 37:57.740
Knows you remarkably well.

37:57.740 --> 38:02.912
And suspects that you're here
planning something illegal.

38:03.037 --> 38:08.834
And I can see clearly that you
plan to rob the Blane diamonds.

38:08.876 --> 38:13.922
Now you used the diamonds
you sold them to gain entrance.

38:13.922 --> 38:20.179
- But how did you take these photos?
- My purse doubles as a camera.

38:21.263 --> 38:25.768
I would like to thank you for providing
me with such an extensive plan.

38:25.768 --> 38:26.977
Wait a minute!

38:26.977 --> 38:30.314
Know how to pick a variable
induction electronic lock?

38:30.314 --> 38:33.317
Know the guard schedule?
The alarm system? Huh?

38:33.317 --> 38:35.903
It may take me time
to study your plan,

38:35.903 --> 38:38.280
but I'm in no hurry.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.699
Blane diamonds are.
Take off tomorrow.

38:40.699 --> 38:42.117
Early.

38:42.117 --> 38:45.579
You're implying I couldn't manage
this venture without you.

38:45.579 --> 38:48.332
You catch on real quick.

38:52.753 --> 38:55.380
- Partners.
- Partners.

39:13.190 --> 39:16.359
Help me. Please.

39:16.526 --> 39:19.112
Help me.

39:25.493 --> 39:28.079
Easy, lady. I've got you.

39:29.497 --> 39:32.125
Oh, God.

39:32.709 --> 39:36.713
- Call the police.
- Just hold on. Hold on.

39:39.549 --> 39:42.177
Wait!

41:29.074 --> 41:31.702
Let's do it.

42:25.797 --> 42:29.217
A king's ransom.
I commend you both.

42:37.559 --> 42:40.353
You're everything Mr Keach
said you were.

42:40.353 --> 42:45.108
I'd like to thank you for making this
a very profitable partnership.

42:45.108 --> 42:48.528
Short-lived as it was.
I'll take that.

42:48.528 --> 42:51.114
Now move over there.

42:51.114 --> 42:54.492
- What are you doing?
- Taking my half and yours.

42:54.492 --> 42:56.244
You would do the same.

42:56.244 --> 42:59.038
Turn around and face the wall.

43:09.257 --> 43:13.678
I could shoot you,
but that would be so vulgar.

43:14.303 --> 43:20.309
It's so much more poetic to execute you
in your own gas chamber.

43:47.294 --> 43:49.922
Cover your nose and mouth.

43:58.264 --> 44:01.225
How is it that we knew
he'd do something like that?

44:01.225 --> 44:03.853
Human nature.

44:17.408 --> 44:20.035
Let's go.

44:21.245 --> 44:23.831
To the consulate.

44:45.936 --> 44:48.564
Well done, Fred.

44:49.523 --> 44:53.151
Okay, Charlie,
let's hit the consulate.

45:06.623 --> 45:09.334
Your Excellency? Mr Blane...?

45:09.501 --> 45:12.838
I'm not Mr Blane.
My name is Peter Thornton.

45:12.838 --> 45:16.341
And you're not a diplomat.
You're a thief and a murderer.

45:16.341 --> 45:17.592
What on earth...?

45:17.592 --> 45:22.180
Mr Thornton came here to formally
accuse you of serious crimes, Amir.

45:22.180 --> 45:26.518
I, on your behalf, have
demanded proof. And still do.

45:26.518 --> 45:31.648
Well, go ahead, search him.
Start with the attaché case.

45:45.995 --> 45:48.331
Mr Ambassador, this man is a thief.

45:48.331 --> 45:51.167
That case is full of stolen diamonds.
Search him.

45:51.167 --> 45:53.711
Enough! Your Excellency,

45:53.711 --> 45:58.341
you cannot permit this.
I have diplomatic immunity.

45:59.008 --> 46:00.885
Truly.

46:00.885 --> 46:02.679
There can be no search.

46:02.679 --> 46:06.266
Gentlemen, I have business
to attend to.

46:06.266 --> 46:08.893
Will you excuse me, please?

46:09.102 --> 46:11.729
This one's for Danny.

46:12.772 --> 46:15.858
- Arrest him!
- I do like working with you people.

46:15.858 --> 46:19.028
You can't prosecute me.
You can't even hold me.

46:19.028 --> 46:21.656
Security!

46:22.573 --> 46:25.243
Your Excellency!
What does this mean?

46:25.243 --> 46:27.036
Your Excellency! Justice!

46:27.036 --> 46:29.372
American justice!

46:29.372 --> 46:31.999
I claim American justice!

46:32.305 --> 46:38.297
