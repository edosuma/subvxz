WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:03.953
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

00:04.038 --> 00:06.040
That was a real nice brick dance.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.919
- Well, I left you a package in the garage.
- Heroin?

00:10.002 --> 00:11.128
We need these votes.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.756
- I'm thinking a golf membership.
- I don't play golf.

00:13.839 --> 00:17.426
- What is it you do play, Celia?
- I play house.

00:17.509 --> 00:19.637
<i>We're shooting a movie
in one of our empty houses.</i>

00:19.720 --> 00:22.640
Needs a caterer. You'll thank me later.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.933
Can you convince Mom

00:24.016 --> 00:26.644
that I'm stuck in a classroom
full of religious zealots

00:26.727 --> 00:28.103
two clicks away from jihad?

00:28.187 --> 00:32.149
I like you, Nancy Botwin. I bet you look good
rolling out of bed in the morning.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.193
Have you been fucking him all this time?

00:34.276 --> 00:37.029
It's just business between us.
Always has been.

00:37.112 --> 00:40.908
Agent Fundis, DEA.
I'm here to talk about Peter Scottson.

00:40.991 --> 00:44.203
He hasn't come into work for a few days
and we haven't heard from him.

00:44.286 --> 00:47.540
Clinique here'll go take you in the other room
and fuck the gay out of you.

00:47.623 --> 00:49.917
I can see your boner.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.293
Don't be embarrassed.

00:51.377 --> 00:54.296
- That's what God's love is all about.
- I been shot.

00:54.380 --> 00:57.800
Man, you think it was the Mexicans?
Cucaracha motherfuckers.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.011
Now, where's our crop?

01:02.221 --> 01:05.474
You'll get your fucking crops,
and then we're done with your ass.

01:05.558 --> 01:08.269
It's over when I say it's over.

01:09.895 --> 01:12.606
- U-Turn? U-Turn, oh, my God.
- Call for help.

01:12.690 --> 01:15.401
I've been waiting a long time for this,
motherfucker.

01:15.484 --> 01:18.737
U- Turn's dead, he's dead.

01:24.451 --> 01:27.288
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:27.371 --> 01:30.082
<i># Little boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

01:30.165 --> 01:33.168
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:33.252 --> 01:35.880
<i># And they all look just the same</i>

01:35.963 --> 01:39.008
<i># There's doctors and lawyers</i>

01:39.091 --> 01:41.760
<i># And business executives</i>

01:41.844 --> 01:44.763
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:44.847 --> 01:47.516
<i># And they all look just the same</i>

01:47.600 --> 01:50.477
<i># And they play on the golf course</i>

01:50.561 --> 01:53.647
<i># And they drink their martinis dry</i>

01:53.731 --> 01:56.442
<i># And they all have pretty children</i>

01:56.525 --> 01:59.236
<i># And they all look just the same</i>

01:59.320 --> 02:02.615
<i># Young boys want to be men,
start a business and raise a family</i>

02:02.698 --> 02:05.451
<i># Send their kids to summer camp,

02:05.534 --> 02:08.704
<i># Like it's really going to make a difference,
you hoping they can change</i>

02:08.787 --> 02:11.415
<i># But get yourself a little box,
we all the same</i>

02:11.498 --> 02:14.752

we all the same #</i>

<i># We are living... #</i>

02:29.516 --> 02:31.518
Why exactly is he in a hot tub?

02:31.602 --> 02:35.522
- The boat didn't fit.
- Oh, of course not. Yeah.

02:35.606 --> 02:40.069
Look at his grandmamma
crying over there in her designer dress.

02:40.611 --> 02:44.573
He sure was good to her.
She gonna miss that gravy train.

02:44.657 --> 02:48.619
Someone should go over there and poke him.
See if he flinch or something.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.287
Just to be sure.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.706
He look pretty dead to me.

02:53.374 --> 02:56.001
What's up, Two Strikes?

02:56.085 --> 02:59.171
- Hey Clinique. How you doing, baby?
- Oh, fucking pregnant again.

02:59.255 --> 03:02.841
Some Indian kid I mercy fucked for U-Turn.

03:04.426 --> 03:07.012
Oh, sorry. Y'all know each other?

03:07.596 --> 03:10.474
- No, hi. Two Strikes, is it?
- Yeah.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.601
- Nancy, hello.
- What's up?

03:12.685 --> 03:14.853
I ain't giving this one up.

03:15.646 --> 03:18.649
Damn, I remember
when he was just a wannabe.

03:19.525 --> 03:22.611
We busted our carjacking cherries together.

03:24.989 --> 03:27.283
He taught me how to drive-by.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.788
- Respect.
- Thank you.

03:34.748 --> 03:38.794
Don't think of this as a loss of identity,
think of this as an upgrade to a better way of life.

03:39.545 --> 03:42.256
Better services,
better schools, better tax base.

03:42.339 --> 03:44.216
- This merger...
- Oh, enough!

03:44.300 --> 03:48.846
Agrestic and Majestic are never gonna merge.
I told them about your deal with Celia.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.140
Where are our houses?

03:51.223 --> 03:54.059
- Yeah.
- I was more than generous with all of you.

03:54.143 --> 03:58.522
Let's get an idea on the vote. I got to get home
for Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?

03:58.606 --> 04:00.733
All those in favour of a town merger, say aye.

04:00.816 --> 04:03.110
- Aye.
- All those against.

04:03.193 --> 04:04.695
Nay.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.364
Oh, the nays have it. Up your ass, Groff.

04:07.448 --> 04:11.118
Friends, this is a colossal mistake.
Think of the people you represent.

04:11.202 --> 04:13.454
The votes aren't there.

04:13.537 --> 04:14.955
Nothing more to say.

04:15.039 --> 04:18.250
Find another town to swallow.
Celia can help. She's good at that.

04:18.334 --> 04:21.003
All right, not so fast, fourth grader.

04:21.086 --> 04:25.174
There is a way to bypass
the city council on this issue.

04:25.257 --> 04:29.470
If it's put to a referendum,
the town can decide.

04:29.553 --> 04:33.724
Referendum. Hell of an idea,
Councilwoman Hodes.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.644
- Whore.
- Whore.

04:37.853 --> 04:39.230
- Whore.
- Whore.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.440
- Ow, ow!
- Oops!

04:42.066 --> 04:44.818
- You did that on purpose.
- What's wrong with you people?

04:44.902 --> 04:46.195
- Whore.
- Ms Hodes knows

04:46.278 --> 04:47.738
that this is good for Agrestic.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.407
Whatever. Let's get out of here.

04:57.706 --> 05:03.295
- I want to thank you for that.
- Hey, that's what friends do.

05:03.379 --> 05:05.130
I don't want to be your friend.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.300
Come home with me.

05:08.384 --> 05:11.720
- What about lunch tomorrow?
- I'm not hungry for food.

05:12.888 --> 05:15.182
Well, maybe by then you will be.

05:22.106 --> 05:24.358
So, what does this mean for our debt?

05:24.441 --> 05:25.693
Are we off the hook?

05:25.776 --> 05:28.737
Depends on who makes new leader.

05:29.989 --> 05:33.158
Well, how does that work?
Is there an election?

05:33.242 --> 05:35.369
What, you ain't get the ballot?

05:35.452 --> 05:38.330
There's Marvin,
maybe he can shed some light.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.836
Hey, Marvin. How you doing?

05:43.919 --> 05:48.090
- OK.
- I know this must be really hard for you,

05:48.173 --> 05:52.970
losing your friend, your cuz,
which could mean your cousin or not.

05:53.053 --> 05:56.098
I'm a little unclear.

05:56.181 --> 05:58.309
But also your leader.

05:59.476 --> 06:02.062
My dad and his moms were second cousins.

06:02.146 --> 06:05.983
Oh, there you go.
So, I just also wanted to say

06:06.066 --> 06:09.862
that it's been great getting to know you,
and maybe one day...

06:09.945 --> 06:13.490
Wait. You think cos U-Turn dead,
you off the hook?

06:13.574 --> 06:16.952
- No.
- Who's in charge now?

06:17.036 --> 06:18.162
Me.

06:19.914 --> 06:24.168
I'm the nigger in charge over here.
You owe me now.

06:25.669 --> 06:29.590
- You got a problem with that?
- No, it's just...

06:29.673 --> 06:31.592
That's a big job you're taking on, Marvin.

06:31.675 --> 06:34.136
- I'm a big boy.
- Yeah. How's your ass doing?

06:34.220 --> 06:38.515
How'd you know about that? Nancy?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.517
I didn't say anything. I swear.

06:40.601 --> 06:44.021
U- Turn. He said something about it
the other day when he paid me a visit.

06:44.104 --> 06:47.775
He said the Mexicans popped you?
You gonna take that shit on?

06:47.858 --> 06:50.027
I ain't afraid of those Taco Bells.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.071
But I am gonna settle things right.

06:52.154 --> 06:54.323
- Settle?
- Call a meeting.

06:54.406 --> 06:57.284
Figure something out
before we all kill each other.

06:57.368 --> 06:58.702
You're going face to face.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.997
They gonna gun your big ass down
for real this time.

07:02.081 --> 07:04.041
Not with her there, they won't.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.627
No one wants a dead white lady
on their hands.

07:06.710 --> 07:09.421
Oh, I'm not sure I'm comfortable
going to a gang summit.

07:09.505 --> 07:13.092
You ain't got no fucking choice.
We going tomorrow.

07:16.762 --> 07:18.806
I thought you were going to
summer camp.

07:18.889 --> 07:22.017
Too expensive with the divorce.
Everything's a mess.

07:22.935 --> 07:26.063
- So, what's the deal here?
- Watch.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.733
- This is a case of betrayal.
- Judas did it.

07:34.655 --> 07:38.784
This is the strange case
of the mad scientist.

07:38.868 --> 07:41.745
Big bang's a lie and dinosaurs lived on earth
the same time as man.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.414
- Shane Botwin.
- What?

07:43.497 --> 07:47.084
If you're gonna shove your doctrine
down our throats, at least be clever about it.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.963
Oh, I thought I was.
But I guess you're just too smart for me.

07:51.046 --> 07:52.464
Perhaps you should take over.

07:52.548 --> 07:55.634
Present something to the class
that is mysterious to you.

07:55.718 --> 07:58.596
- OK.
- OK, stand up.

08:01.307 --> 08:06.312
I'd like to solve the mystery
of the school that receives federal funding,

08:06.395 --> 08:08.439
yet promotes a religious curriculum

08:08.522 --> 08:13.736
in direct violation
of Church-State separation mandates.

08:15.070 --> 08:18.449
- Sit down, Shane Botwin.
- Yes, sir.

08:20.075 --> 08:23.579
- Jesus Christ.
- Exactly.

08:33.631 --> 08:35.216
How you doing?

08:35.299 --> 08:39.345
You know, living the dream. You?

08:39.428 --> 08:42.890
How did you know Marvin got shot?
U- Turn never said anything that day.

08:42.972 --> 08:45.351
You think you deserve
to know the answer to that?

08:45.434 --> 08:47.144
That's what you want to talk about.

08:47.228 --> 08:52.191
- Maybe I want to talk about how you kiss.
- Maybe that's a discussion for another time.

08:52.983 --> 08:57.321
Look. The Mexicans are real pissed
at Marvin for his part in the drive-by.

08:57.404 --> 09:01.534
- U-Turn's pissed they shot Marvin in the ass.
- Maybe they didn't shoot him in the ass.

09:02.618 --> 09:05.704
Maybe someone else did it
to make it look like the Mexicans did it.

09:05.788 --> 09:10.042
Maybe someone did it to start a gang war
and let all them motherfuckers kill each other,

09:10.125 --> 09:12.711
so that we could all be free.

09:15.506 --> 09:17.466
Don't go to this meeting.

09:20.010 --> 09:21.387
Now he's concerned.

09:21.470 --> 09:23.973
What the hell was I supposed to do?

09:24.056 --> 09:25.516
Something.

09:26.183 --> 09:28.060
Maybe I was doing it.

09:29.520 --> 09:30.521
Man.

09:35.526 --> 09:37.945
Sorry I knocked over your plant.

09:39.029 --> 09:40.823
It wasn't my plant.

09:48.873 --> 09:52.376
I'm telling you, Mom,
I'm at a very impressionable age,

09:52.459 --> 09:55.045
and if you're not careful,
this pedagogy will take root,

09:55.129 --> 09:57.464
and you'll end up
with a right-wing narc on your hands.

09:57.548 --> 09:59.049
Hang tough. Stick to your beliefs.

09:59.133 --> 10:01.760
Show a little character.
I know you have it in you.

10:01.844 --> 10:05.973
- They're fundamentalists.
- You're not getting out of summer school.

10:06.056 --> 10:09.518
I have nowhere else to put you and
you're not playing with my video games all day.

10:09.602 --> 10:12.021
Don't say I didn't warn you.

10:12.104 --> 10:13.230
Morning.

10:13.314 --> 10:14.565
Mom, this is Tara.

10:16.233 --> 10:18.903
- It's a little early for a visitor.
- She slept over.

10:22.907 --> 10:25.659
- Silas.
- Mom.

10:26.619 --> 10:28.746
Not after Megan and Quinn.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.498
I'm not going through this again.

10:31.582 --> 10:34.126
You're not gonna make me that mom.

10:34.793 --> 10:37.087
Tara, it's lovely to meet you.

10:37.171 --> 10:39.548
You seem like a nice girl.

10:39.632 --> 10:42.718
But my son isn't allowed
to have sleepovers and he knows this.

10:42.801 --> 10:46.013
Oh, we're not having sex, Mrs Botwin.

10:46.096 --> 10:47.264
I'm a virgin.

10:48.432 --> 10:51.852
- Oh, really?
- I honour God with my abstinence.

10:51.936 --> 10:54.188
Until the day I join my husband in marriage.

10:54.939 --> 10:55.940
You don't say.

10:56.023 --> 11:00.110
- They're everywhere.
- It's true. We're abstaining.

11:04.114 --> 11:07.034
- Well, good for you.
- I have a question.

11:07.117 --> 11:08.911
Do you really think evolution is a lie?

11:08.994 --> 11:14.166
Well, I believe that I'm descended
from Adam and Eve, and not a monkey.

11:14.250 --> 11:20.381
So, natural selection, Darwinism,
empirical data, none of that factors in for you?

11:20.464 --> 11:22.841
Evolution is just a theory.

11:23.425 --> 11:25.928
I mean that's why they call it
the Theory of Evolution

11:26.011 --> 11:28.806
- and not the Fact of Evolution.
- Oh, what about...

11:28.889 --> 11:31.809
Hey. You've asked your question.
Now shut the fuck up.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.728
Silas, don't swear at your brother.
Shane, don't antagonise Tara.

11:34.812 --> 11:38.065
Tara, keep saving it for the Lord.
Where the fuck's Andy?

11:38.857 --> 11:40.693
OK, everybody. That's lunch.

11:44.655 --> 11:48.033
Lexington Steele?
Oh, pleasure to meet you, sir.

11:48.117 --> 11:50.244
Andy Botwin. Huge fan.

11:50.327 --> 11:52.913
Not huge the way you're huge,
admiration huge.

11:52.997 --> 11:56.208
- Thanks, bud.
- Hey, I took you in the ass.

11:56.292 --> 11:59.545
Your dildo.
The one they had moulded from your dick.

11:59.628 --> 12:03.382
I was with a girl, Israeli, she strapped it on.

12:03.465 --> 12:06.343
To be truthful, for me, too big.

12:06.427 --> 12:11.056
Er, the dildo, not the girl.
Gave me a little oose-lay oopie-pay.

12:11.140 --> 12:12.975
- Know what I mean?
- What's good on the menu?

12:13.058 --> 12:15.144
What isn't good?
In the style of this house,

12:15.227 --> 12:17.313
I present you a Mediterranean feast.

12:17.396 --> 12:19.815
Hummus, baba ghanoush, couscous...

12:19.899 --> 12:22.526
- Got any beef?
- Oh, yeah, kebabs right there.

12:22.610 --> 12:25.196
- OK.
- So, does beef keep you hard?

12:25.279 --> 12:26.322
I just like beef.

12:29.450 --> 12:31.702
- Hey.
- Oh, ladies, back away.

12:31.785 --> 12:35.873
One stray pube in the tabbouleh, the health
department could shut down the whole buffet.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.459
Wait, look at you shaven mavens.

12:38.542 --> 12:41.212
I take it all back, go ahead. Step right up.

12:42.087 --> 12:46.300
- Oh, you're funny.
- And cute, for a cook.

12:49.428 --> 12:52.514
- What's up?
- Come on in. Close the door.

12:52.598 --> 12:55.559
Fine, but we're keeping the shades open.

12:55.643 --> 12:59.188
Listen, I just had a development
get shut down in Phoenix

12:59.271 --> 13:02.566
because of paperwork issues,
and I need for that not to happen here.

13:02.650 --> 13:07.029
Be a doll and legalise my construction crew
for me this afternoon.

13:08.364 --> 13:11.534
Look, I know this is not the most
kosher thing in the world to do,

13:11.617 --> 13:15.287
so if you can't do it, I'll just fire you
and hire someone who will.

13:15.371 --> 13:20.000
You have no idea how un-kosher I can be.

13:20.084 --> 13:22.002
Oh, well, now I'm intrigued. Tell me more.

13:22.086 --> 13:24.588
Can I do this tomorrow? I have an appointment.

13:24.672 --> 13:26.632
- An appointment?
- It's a woman thing.

13:26.715 --> 13:31.720
Oh, well, it always is with you women.
OK, tomorrow.

13:33.430 --> 13:34.974
I got lunch.

13:36.392 --> 13:40.479
I figured we'd eat at one of those tables
in the courtyard and...

13:41.272 --> 13:45.401
Oh. Nancy, I only have two sandwiches.

13:45.484 --> 13:48.279
- I'm sorry.
- No problem, Celia.

13:48.863 --> 13:53.450
You know, Sullivan, the fastest way
to get those referendum signatures

13:53.534 --> 13:57.329
may be to have Nancy gather them.

13:57.413 --> 14:00.499
She has scads of sales experience.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.459
That's a great idea, Celia.

14:02.543 --> 14:05.629
Yeah, you've got yourself
a good little worker here.

14:07.798 --> 14:09.174
I'll be back later.

14:15.306 --> 14:17.975
Dude, if you are fucking with us,
that is so not cool...

14:18.058 --> 14:20.102
Shh! We're rolling.

14:20.185 --> 14:22.229
These are my dishwashers.

14:22.313 --> 14:24.315
Over here.

14:24.398 --> 14:25.733
Be cool.

14:30.654 --> 14:34.992
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
Why's the black guy wearing a pirate's hat?

14:35.075 --> 14:37.119
It's called Peckers of the Caribbean.

14:37.203 --> 14:41.248
- He's Captain Jack. Get it?
- Not really. Shouldn't they be on a ship?

14:42.041 --> 14:43.834
There's an anchor.

14:46.587 --> 14:49.215
Urgh.

14:49.298 --> 14:51.800
- Pardon me.
- Come on, we're still rolling.

14:51.884 --> 14:55.804
- Come on, keep going.
- Still rolling, still rolling.

14:55.888 --> 14:58.599
- Oh, God, oh.
- Actually, I need five minutes.

14:58.682 --> 15:01.018
- Oh!
- Better make it 10.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.978
Cut. Cut.

15:06.232 --> 15:07.233
Hey.

15:08.234 --> 15:10.110
- How you doing?
- Sore.

15:11.529 --> 15:14.657
- Hi, I'm... I'm Dean.
- Are you staring at my tits?

15:14.740 --> 15:18.160
- Paul. Get this fucking creep out of here.
- I didn't do anything.

15:18.244 --> 15:19.537
- Jenny.
- Fucking pervert.

15:19.620 --> 15:23.332
- I didn't do anything.
- Escort Mr Tits off the property.

15:23.415 --> 15:25.251
I didn't do anything.

15:26.001 --> 15:29.213
Paul, I gotta go home.
His food gave me the shits.

15:29.838 --> 15:31.507
Well, I guess we're even.

15:34.009 --> 15:36.720
God damn it. My lead's gone.

15:36.804 --> 15:39.557
This is not good, not good.

15:39.640 --> 15:40.933
Let's do all girls.

15:41.016 --> 15:43.352
Honey, it's called Peckers of the Caribbean.

15:43.435 --> 15:46.689
How are we gonna do a movie
about peckers without peckers?

15:46.772 --> 15:51.944
I'll do it. I recently measured myself
and I'm quite large.

15:52.027 --> 15:56.115
Not Lex large, but respectable.
And I'm practically a peg leg.

15:56.198 --> 15:57.283
- Fuck you.
- Fair enough.

15:57.366 --> 15:59.702
Jenny, this one goes, too.

15:59.785 --> 16:03.330
And you, listen to me.
From now on, it's chicken and fucking rice.

16:03.414 --> 16:06.250
If I see anything ethnic on this table,
you are fired.

16:06.333 --> 16:10.754
The only thing I want coming out
of my actors' asses is a hard dick. Got it?

16:11.547 --> 16:13.215
Say you love Jesus. Say it.

16:13.299 --> 16:15.843
If I say I love another man,
doesn't that make me gay?

16:15.926 --> 16:20.222
- Do you want to be damned for all eternity?
- No, I just want you to go to hell.

16:21.765 --> 16:25.185
- We're trying to save you.
- You guys, stop.

16:27.104 --> 16:31.191
"Blessed are the peacemakers. "
Matthew 5:9.

16:31.275 --> 16:34.403
Shane, don't you want to be saved?

16:35.237 --> 16:38.073
- By you?
- Well, only you can decide

16:38.157 --> 16:42.369
to take Jesus into your heart,
but I can help.

16:43.078 --> 16:45.873
We can talk about him, study his word.

16:45.956 --> 16:48.584
Why don't we try it at lunch today?

16:48.667 --> 16:51.462
- See how it goes.
- OK.

16:52.671 --> 16:53.923
Great.

17:02.139 --> 17:04.016
What happened to you?

17:05.601 --> 17:07.728
Amelia's going to save me.

17:16.819 --> 17:18.071
Amelia.

17:22.201 --> 17:24.369
I'm not sure this is such a good idea.

17:24.453 --> 17:28.916
- You second guessing me, bitch?
- No, not at all. Respect.

17:28.999 --> 17:32.962
I'm just... Maybe you shouldn't mention
them having shot you or the drive-by.

17:33.045 --> 17:38.008
You know how gangsters can be
and their egos and their guns and shivs.

17:38.092 --> 17:42.638
Look, they ain't gonna shoot you in public,
so just shut the fuck up.

17:43.222 --> 17:45.224
Hey, it's the brick dance lady.

17:45.307 --> 17:46.308
Yo.

17:46.850 --> 17:50.604
- Give me back our fucking chiva.
- Man, I don't got your chiva.

17:51.230 --> 17:55.985
If you let me have the weed trade, you can take
everything else. All the hard shit's yours.

17:56.068 --> 17:58.028
I ain't a greedy hard-ass like U-Turn.

17:59.655 --> 18:02.074
- Whoa!
- Where's our fucking chiva, pendejo?

18:02.157 --> 18:05.411
Yo, man, I ain't got it. No. Please.

18:05.995 --> 18:08.330
Know what? Maybe we kill you anyway.

18:08.414 --> 18:09.915
Turn you on a spit.

18:11.750 --> 18:14.420
I can feed a whole fucking country.

18:14.503 --> 18:18.090
- What... What's chiva?
- Tigre. Goma. Brea.

18:18.173 --> 18:21.343
- No, no, no, no, no comprende.
- Heroin, chelita.

18:21.427 --> 18:23.637
Oh.

18:23.721 --> 18:26.599
No. Now I think I know
what he's talking about.

18:27.725 --> 18:29.476
- Maybe.
- You got my chapapote?

18:29.560 --> 18:31.520
Oh, jeez, you have so many names for it.

18:31.604 --> 18:34.899
Yeah, it's kind of like
Eskimos and snow. Right?

18:35.941 --> 18:39.862
You better talk quick
before I pop burrito here, querida.

18:39.945 --> 18:43.616
If I knew where it was, your... stuff,

18:43.699 --> 18:46.493
and you got it back,
would you leave us alone?

18:48.454 --> 18:50.456
Please take the gun out of his mouth.

18:52.833 --> 18:55.294
That motherfucker trusted you and not me?

18:55.377 --> 18:57.504
Enough, Marvin. He didn't appreciate you.

18:57.588 --> 18:59.173
Now, listen, listen, listen.

18:59.256 --> 19:02.509
I want you to wipe out my debt, all of it.

19:02.593 --> 19:04.261
Along with Heylia's and Conrad's.

19:04.345 --> 19:07.556
Gone. Finished. Over.

19:07.640 --> 19:11.602
Bullshit. You mine, bitch, you all mine.

19:12.478 --> 19:17.858
Guillermo, Marvin doesn't want me
to give you your chiva back.

19:17.942 --> 19:20.486
I want to, but I'm his bitch, so I can't.

19:22.112 --> 19:25.991
Yo, Fat Albert. You gonna give
my brick dancer what she wants?

19:26.534 --> 19:29.453
Or maybe you want to hang out
with U-Turn again?

19:29.537 --> 19:31.622
I'm sure that he's lonely en el infierno.

19:31.705 --> 19:35.626
- OK, OK.
- On your mother's life?

19:35.709 --> 19:38.003
I swear. You off the hook.

19:41.340 --> 19:43.467
And I'm growing impatient.

19:43.551 --> 19:46.679
OK, one sec. One sec, one sec, one sec.

19:50.641 --> 19:53.394
OK, tomorrow morning,
go to this address,

19:54.353 --> 19:57.856
follow these instructions,
you'll get your trunk. OK?

19:57.940 --> 20:03.320
Hey, both of you.
These streets belongs to Mexico now.

20:03.404 --> 20:07.408
You out of the drug business, amigos.
Not even mota.

20:08.325 --> 20:10.911
Oh, that's weed in English.

20:10.995 --> 20:15.457
I don't ever want to see or hear
about you dealing anywhere in my city.

20:16.375 --> 20:19.128
Nada. Nothing.

20:29.972 --> 20:31.181
Adios.

20:37.771 --> 20:39.356
Hey, hey, hey.

20:42.985 --> 20:46.488
Hey, Amelia. I missed you at lunch today.
What happened?

20:46.572 --> 20:50.201
I apologise, Shane.
I haven't forgotten about you.

20:50.284 --> 20:53.871
The Lord has sent me someone
who's in greater need of prayer and counsel.

20:53.954 --> 20:57.416
Yeah? But I'm a blasphemous, liberal Jew.

20:57.499 --> 20:59.919
What could be worse than that?

21:00.002 --> 21:03.923
Isabelle thinks she's a homosexual,
but she's just lost her way.

21:04.006 --> 21:05.966
I've gotta help her.

21:19.897 --> 21:23.067
Hola. Cómo está? Gracias.

21:24.735 --> 21:30.741
Hola. Su nombre es Martin Shackelman.
Hola, Señor Shackelman.

21:30.824 --> 21:33.035
Mi nombre es Estefan Fenelon.

21:33.118 --> 21:37.414
No, Estefan. You are now Harold Strauss.

21:37.498 --> 21:39.875
Si, señor, si.

21:43.587 --> 21:49.051
Erm... Sign with your new name, por favor.

21:49.134 --> 21:53.639
Sign this petition
for an Agrestic-Majestic merge.

21:54.932 --> 21:57.393
Si. It's a beautiful thing.

21:57.977 --> 22:00.020
Gracias. Por favor.

22:00.479 --> 22:02.106
Got to learn Spanish.

Your referendum, non-kosher.

23:10.799 --> 23:14.136
I don't believe it.
You couldn't have had time to get them all.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.180
I'm very resourceful.

23:18.682 --> 23:22.436
There's a towel in the bathroom
if you need to get out of your wet clothes.

23:24.230 --> 23:26.148
I don't need a towel.

23:28.776 --> 23:31.153
You're gonna help me celebrate.

23:33.656 --> 23:36.283
- What are we celebrating?
- My freedom.

23:37.368 --> 23:40.079
- Are you quitting?
- No.

23:41.205 --> 23:42.581
At least not yet.

23:42.665 --> 23:45.334
We're gonna see how this goes first.

23:53.300 --> 23:55.052
Any chance you speak Spanish?

23:55.135 --> 23:56.762
Huh?

23:57.846 --> 23:58.847
Never mind.

24:01.225 --> 24:03.894
Oh, I have to warn you.

24:03.978 --> 24:07.731
My last two relationships,
both guys ended up dead.
