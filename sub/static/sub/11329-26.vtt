Previously on <i>The Secret Life</i>
<i>of the American Teenager...</i>

00:03.411 --> 00:05.679
I'm getting more uncomfortable
by the minute.

00:05.680 --> 00:07.247
What do you think might help?

00:07.248 --> 00:10.050
Maybe when we go see Dr. Attavi
today, he can suggest something.

00:10.051 --> 00:12.435
Does it bother you that Ben
and Adrian are now married?

00:12.436 --> 00:13.346
Why should it?

00:13.354 --> 00:15.689
Did you have sex?
I did.

00:15.690 --> 00:16.923
Maybe I'm not really
in love with her.

00:16.924 --> 00:18.925
Don't ever ask to borrow
the apartment again.

00:18.926 --> 00:22.529
Welcome Mr. and Mrs. Ben Boykewich
back to school.

00:22.530 --> 00:24.698
[cheering]
Thank you, everyone.

00:24.699 --> 00:26.199
I met George when we
were leaving the wedding.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.367
You can't go out with him.

00:27.368 --> 00:29.402
You let Madison and Jack
have sex in your bed?

00:29.403 --> 00:31.438
If you're ready to take this
relationship seriously, so am I.

00:31.439 --> 00:33.406
I don't want to be friends
with my old boyfriend.

00:33.407 --> 00:34.941
You're not friends
with your old girlfriend.

00:34.942 --> 00:36.142
I still hear from her
once in a while.

00:36.143 --> 00:38.044
What?
You should meet Angie.

00:38.045 --> 00:41.781
I really love you, but sex isn't right
for the two of us right now.

00:41.782 --> 00:43.116
When's your husband
getting back in town?

00:43.117 --> 00:45.652
He really loves it there
in-- in Zimbabwe.

00:45.653 --> 00:47.954
You think maybe the two of us
can drive up the coast

00:47.955 --> 00:49.456
and have dinner somewhere
on the beach?

00:49.457 --> 00:51.625
Maybe even spend the night
at a decent hotel.

00:51.626 --> 00:54.060
Something just--
just doesn't feel right.

00:54.061 --> 00:56.563
You don't think
that you're going into labor?

00:57.665 --> 01:00.367
I'm not sure.

01:19.353 --> 01:22.355
You look like an idiot.
You know that, right?

01:22.356 --> 01:23.857
Good morning!

01:33.934 --> 01:36.102
[chuckles]
Good morning.

01:36.103 --> 01:38.338
Someone's in a good mood.

01:38.339 --> 01:40.974
Oh. You didn't forget,
right?

01:40.975 --> 01:42.676
Going away
with Ricky tonight.

01:42.677 --> 01:44.144
No, I didn't forget.

01:44.145 --> 01:46.513
I just thought that maybe--
I didn't forget.

01:46.514 --> 01:48.088
I'm just gonna accept that
your relationship with Ricky

01:48.113 --> 01:49.313
is your relationship with Ricky

01:49.617 --> 01:51.918
and hope that everything
I taught you up to today

01:51.919 --> 01:54.487
comes into play tonight when you
decide not to have sex.

01:54.488 --> 01:56.956
Thanks, Dad.
When you decide not to have sex.

01:56.957 --> 01:58.658
Yeah.
Not to have sex.

01:58.659 --> 02:01.361
I love you so much
for keeping John tonight.

02:01.362 --> 02:03.563
You know, it's so nice to be able
to go away for a night

02:03.564 --> 02:05.231
and know that
he's going to be cared for.

02:05.232 --> 02:06.700
He won't even miss me.
He loves you.

02:06.701 --> 02:08.735
Kathleen said that
if I had any problems at all,

02:08.735 --> 02:10.737
she'd come over and help me out.
Kathleen is married.

02:10.738 --> 02:13.073
She's an old friend.
She's an ex-wife.

02:13.074 --> 02:14.741
Right.

02:14.742 --> 02:16.843
Besides, you're not going to have
any problems with John, I'm sure.

02:18.746 --> 02:21.514
Hey, what ever happened
to Leo's assistant, Camille?

02:21.515 --> 02:23.116
I thought you didn't like
me hanging out with her.

02:23.117 --> 02:25.852
I don't. But the date
didn't go so well?

02:25.853 --> 02:28.354
She didn't show up.

02:28.355 --> 02:30.790
She called eventually to say
she just couldn't get out of work.

02:30.791 --> 02:33.326
But, basically,
I got stood up.

02:33.327 --> 02:35.161
And then you ran into Kathleen.

02:35.162 --> 02:37.864
As luck would have it.
I know she's married.

02:37.865 --> 02:39.899
But she's been married
three times, once widowed,

02:39.900 --> 02:42.969
and maybe we both
got it right the first time.

02:42.970 --> 02:44.971
Mmm.

02:44.972 --> 02:47.707
Why are you being
so nice to me?

02:47.708 --> 02:49.509
I'm always nice
to you, Tom.

02:49.510 --> 02:52.479
You don't always
make me pancakes.

02:52.480 --> 02:54.414
I just felt
like making pancakes.

02:54.415 --> 02:55.782
Why?

02:55.783 --> 02:59.052
Because I felt like
making pancakes for you.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.954
Why?
I don't know, Tom.

03:00.955 --> 03:02.722
I guess I just woke up
in a good mood.

03:02.723 --> 03:04.491
Why?

03:04.492 --> 03:06.626
Let me answer that.

03:06.627 --> 03:09.696
George Juergens.
He followed you home?

03:09.697 --> 03:11.631
Yeah.

03:11.632 --> 03:14.167
I thought I saw you
run up the driveway.

03:14.168 --> 03:16.870
Look, Tom,
he did follow me home,

03:16.871 --> 03:19.806
but that's just because we ran into each
other when I was out picking up food.

03:19.807 --> 03:22.308
And that is not why
I'm in a good mood.

03:22.309 --> 03:24.110
There's no reason
why I'm in a good mood.

03:24.111 --> 03:25.779
I'm just in a good mood.

03:25.780 --> 03:26.880
Me, too.

03:26.881 --> 03:29.115
Because of the pancakes?
Negative.

03:29.116 --> 03:30.450
Because?

03:30.451 --> 03:33.119
I finally met

03:33.120 --> 03:35.755
someone on the bus.

03:36.857 --> 03:38.024
That's great.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.060
Honey, I'm home.

03:41.061 --> 03:43.396
Oh, my God!

03:43.397 --> 03:45.064
Oh, my God!
Oh!

03:45.065 --> 03:47.433
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

03:47.434 --> 03:48.768
Is it?

03:53.941 --> 03:55.975
Did you hear back
from the doctor?

03:55.976 --> 03:57.977
Jeez, where is this guy?
Yeah, I heard back.

03:57.978 --> 04:00.178
Well, I heard back from Old Lady
Attavi, as you call her.

04:00.203 --> 04:01.636
So why are we just sitting here?

04:01.882 --> 04:04.017
I'm not just sitting here. I'm getting
our things ready for the hospital.

04:06.086 --> 04:08.688
The hospital?
Not the doctor's office but the hospital?

04:08.689 --> 04:11.791
Yeah. She said
to meet her at the hospital.

04:11.792 --> 04:13.329
And I just wanna make sure

04:13.354 --> 04:15.146
we have our list together
so we have everything we need.

04:15.296 --> 04:18.264
Did your water break?
Are you in labor?

04:18.265 --> 04:20.333
Dear God, woman,
why didn't you say something?

04:20.334 --> 04:23.536
Calm down!
Nothing has happened like that.

04:23.537 --> 04:27.507
But, well, she did say to meet her
at the hospital, so...

04:28.609 --> 04:30.276
Are you okay?

04:30.277 --> 04:32.345
Yeah, I'm fine. I--

04:32.346 --> 04:35.882
I feel strangely calm.
So does she.

04:35.883 --> 04:39.452
Do you think that this--
this could be it?

04:39.453 --> 04:41.454
Could be.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.022
I don't know.

04:43.023 --> 04:45.358
So let's just keep this between us
until we do know.

04:45.359 --> 04:47.594

05:02.353 --> 05:03.820
I think I'm in trouble.

05:03.821 --> 05:06.489
How? How did you
get in trouble?

05:06.490 --> 05:08.058
When have you done anything
to get into trouble?

05:08.059 --> 05:10.827
You can't be in trouble.
I just came over to your side.

05:10.828 --> 05:13.129
Jack and I decided not to have sex,
and now you're pregnant?

05:13.130 --> 05:16.633
Whoa. No. I'm not pregnant.
I haven't had sex.

05:16.634 --> 05:19.703
I just--
I have to break up with Frank.

05:19.704 --> 05:22.305
He's a nice guy.
He's a great-looking guy.

05:22.306 --> 05:24.307
But so what?
So was Jesse.

05:24.308 --> 05:26.076
I don't understand.

05:26.077 --> 05:29.546
He wants me to spend tomorrow with
him and his family at the tennis club.

05:29.547 --> 05:31.348
We're gonna play tennis
and have lunch

05:31.349 --> 05:33.683
and then play some more tennis
and then go over to his house

05:33.684 --> 05:35.652
and go swimming
in their indoor pool

05:35.653 --> 05:37.153
and then have a cookout.

05:37.154 --> 05:39.178
And he wants my parents
to the cookout.

05:39.203 --> 05:40.403
My parents.

05:40.558 --> 05:42.907
So, rather than have him
and his family spend time

05:42.932 --> 05:44.060
with you and your family,

05:44.061 --> 05:45.862
you'd rather just
break up with him?

05:45.863 --> 05:48.465
I have to. I don't know how else
to get out of it.

05:48.466 --> 05:50.264
And what's the point of putting
myself through my parents

05:50.289 --> 05:51.589
meeting anyone's parents

05:51.636 --> 05:54.170
when I doubt this is the guy
I'm gonna marry?

05:54.171 --> 05:56.239
It's bad enough
I had to let Frank meet them.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.708
But I never let them talk.
Not for more than two seconds.

05:58.709 --> 06:01.177
Your parents are okay.
What's wrong with your parents?

06:01.178 --> 06:03.713
They're in that honeymoon stage,

06:03.714 --> 06:05.682
only they're not on a honeymoon.

06:05.683 --> 06:08.418
They're not married,
and I haven't told Frank.

06:08.419 --> 06:10.887
He thinks they're married, and his
parents think they're married

06:10.888 --> 06:12.656
because I told them
they're married.

06:12.657 --> 06:15.659
I told them they're remarried
because they're sleeping together.

06:15.660 --> 06:17.794
Oh, jeez.
Now I've put that in my head,

06:17.795 --> 06:19.462
and it's only
8:00 in the morning.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.164
Well, just tell Frank
that they're not married

06:21.165 --> 06:23.767
and you don't want them
to come over and meet his parents.

06:23.768 --> 06:25.935
You lied because you--

06:25.936 --> 06:27.937
you were just
so embarrassed by them.

06:27.938 --> 06:29.472
That's really actually
kind of funny.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.876
No, it's not.
And it's too late.

06:32.877 --> 06:34.744
His mother already called
my mother.

06:34.745 --> 06:36.713
Oh. I'm sorry.

06:36.714 --> 06:38.715
Wait.

06:38.716 --> 06:41.685
Wait. You and Jack?

06:41.686 --> 06:44.754
You and Jack-- you two decided
not to have sex?

06:44.755 --> 06:47.257
Yeah. And I've never
been happier.

06:47.258 --> 06:50.160
Me neither.

06:50.161 --> 06:51.761
You and Jack decided
not to have sex?

06:51.762 --> 06:53.363
I wasn't gonna tell you.

06:53.364 --> 06:56.666
Lauren, you parked behind me again,
and I have to go to work.

06:56.667 --> 06:59.302
And, of course, I approached slowly
so as not to overhear anything,

06:59.303 --> 07:02.939
but the door was open,
so I couldn't help but overhear it.

07:02.940 --> 07:05.275
This is great news.
[chuckling]

07:05.276 --> 07:06.509
Dad.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.578
Here's 50 bucks.
For what?

07:08.579 --> 07:10.580
For making
your old man happy.

07:10.581 --> 07:13.183
Go out to dinner with Jack.
But that's it. Just dinner.

07:13.184 --> 07:14.984
Okay. Uh, thanks.

07:14.985 --> 07:16.753
So it's really true?

07:16.754 --> 07:18.955
Yeah, it's really true.

07:18.956 --> 07:21.458
Okay, I'm gonna
go move my car.

07:21.459 --> 07:23.760
Bye. And congratulations.

07:23.761 --> 07:25.428
[chuckles]

07:25.429 --> 07:27.497
We both just decided
that we'd be a lot happier

07:27.498 --> 07:29.632
if we quit doing everything
for now.

07:29.633 --> 07:31.368
I know I'll be
a lot happier.

07:31.369 --> 07:33.203
All right. Well, uh...

07:33.204 --> 07:35.238
It's not some kind
of trick, is it?

07:35.239 --> 07:38.174
No. We both just feel
it's the right decision.

07:38.175 --> 07:39.909
And what made you come
to this decision?

07:40.978 --> 07:43.613
[sighs]

07:43.614 --> 07:45.281
Well, we did it,

07:45.282 --> 07:47.650
and we didn't feel that good
about it afterwards.

07:47.651 --> 07:50.019
It's just
the wrong thing for us.

07:50.020 --> 07:53.256
And, um, just because we did it once
doesn't mean we have to do it again.

08:00.998 --> 08:02.866
Are you okay, Madison?

08:02.867 --> 08:05.235
Yeah, I'm okay. I just
don't want you to hate Jack.

08:06.504 --> 08:09.639
I always did, but now--

08:09.640 --> 08:12.776
now I think Jack and I
have a shot at being friends,

08:12.777 --> 08:14.677
considering the new decision.

08:14.678 --> 08:16.212
Well, thanks, Dad.

08:16.213 --> 08:18.047
I love you, Madison.

08:18.048 --> 08:19.816
Still?

08:19.817 --> 08:20.850
Always.

08:20.851 --> 08:21.851
Thanks.

08:21.852 --> 08:23.853
And I'm, uh,

08:23.854 --> 08:25.989
gonna try
to love Jack as well,

08:25.990 --> 08:27.991
which may be
kind of impossible.

08:27.992 --> 08:30.026
Well, Jack is
a very lovable guy.

08:30.027 --> 08:32.595
Even when we're not--
Especially when we're not...
I think...

08:32.596 --> 08:34.563
...doing the sort of stuff--
...I know all I need to know.

08:34.565 --> 08:36.900
Maybe even more
than I need to know.

08:38.535 --> 08:40.437
Tom, let's go.

08:42.405 --> 08:44.340
That's my hat.

08:44.341 --> 08:46.176
Mind if I borrow it?

08:46.177 --> 08:47.277
I guess not.

08:47.278 --> 08:49.245
Rachel likes hats.

08:49.246 --> 08:51.781
Oh, she does, does she?
Yeah.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.450
All right.
Well, I can't wait to meet her.

08:53.451 --> 08:54.951
If you want,

08:54.952 --> 08:57.954
we could all go out
together tonight.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.056
Yeah, that'd be great.
We'll all go out to dinner.

09:00.057 --> 09:01.758
Me and Madison
and you and Rachel.

09:01.759 --> 09:03.726
[unintelligible]

09:03.727 --> 09:05.462
Uh, say what?

09:05.463 --> 09:08.097
I got myself a family.

09:08.098 --> 09:10.433
Rachel has children?

09:10.434 --> 09:13.970
Two. And I'm gonna be
their daddy.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.371
Did you tell your mom?

09:15.372 --> 09:16.806
Not the right time.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.041
When would be
the right time?

09:18.042 --> 09:20.677
Maybe after you move out

09:20.678 --> 09:23.012
and they move in.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.483
You wanna do what?

09:26.484 --> 09:28.485
I wanna meet Angie.

09:28.486 --> 09:30.620
I don't know, Grace.
That doesn't sound

09:30.621 --> 09:33.623
like a good idea--
your meeting my old girlfriend.

09:33.624 --> 09:36.192
Why not? I mean,
you two are just friends.

09:36.193 --> 09:38.261
And I used to
be jealous of Madison

09:38.262 --> 09:40.396
until I got to know her,
and now I like her.

09:40.397 --> 09:41.998
So I wanna meet Angie.

09:41.999 --> 09:45.134
And Jeff just got home,
so I can only imagine

09:45.135 --> 09:47.337
him and my mom are gonna want
the house to themselves tonight.

09:47.338 --> 09:49.405
I thought maybe we could
swing by and pick her up.

09:49.406 --> 09:51.574
I thought we could all
go to dinner at Jeff's.

09:51.575 --> 09:53.243
I have a coupon.

09:53.244 --> 09:56.045
They gave me and Amy a coupon
when we threw the shower there.

09:56.046 --> 09:58.982
So even though I didn't pay for anything,
I have one-third off a dinner.

09:58.983 --> 10:02.952
So she can eat for free.
It wouldn't cost us a thing.

10:02.953 --> 10:05.355
Is it a buffet?
No.

10:05.356 --> 10:07.991
You've been to Jeff's.
Why would you ask that?

10:07.992 --> 10:09.292
No reason.

10:09.293 --> 10:11.094
[chuckles]

10:11.095 --> 10:12.862
And then
when the baby comes,

10:12.863 --> 10:15.565
the mother looks at her,
or him,

10:15.566 --> 10:18.902
and gives it some wonderful name,
like Beloved.

10:18.903 --> 10:21.137
I mean, it's this magical moment.
I can't really describe it.

10:21.138 --> 10:23.773
The rest of us
just hold our breath

10:23.774 --> 10:25.808
and wait to see what name
the mother's inspired to choose.

10:25.809 --> 10:27.810
And the political
situation there?

10:27.811 --> 10:29.546
That's a little scary.

10:29.547 --> 10:32.148
But politics are politics,
life is life.

10:32.149 --> 10:33.850
Despite the politics,
life goes on.

10:33.851 --> 10:35.218
[chuckles]

10:35.219 --> 10:36.719
I mean,
everything about Africa--

10:36.720 --> 10:38.388
it just--

10:38.389 --> 10:40.423
it makes me feel so alive.

10:40.424 --> 10:43.660
I mean, such extremes.
It's-- It's energizing

10:43.661 --> 10:46.362
and fascinating and new and
ancient all at the same time.

10:51.402 --> 10:53.870
So?
So?

10:53.871 --> 10:56.406
That's why I wanna
go back, Kathleen.

10:56.407 --> 10:59.275
I mean, maybe not to Zimbabwe
but to Africa.

10:59.276 --> 11:01.611
There's a few organizations
that are pursuing me,

11:01.612 --> 11:04.380
so I've got a lot of choices now,
a lot of opportunities.

11:04.381 --> 11:07.417
And, obviously,
I want you to come with me.

11:07.418 --> 11:09.018
Kathleen?

11:09.019 --> 11:11.321
What about Grace and Tom?

11:11.322 --> 11:14.057
Well, Grace only has a little more than
a year left of school,

11:14.058 --> 11:15.458
and then
she's off to college.

11:15.459 --> 11:17.493
And after you went upstairs,
I was talking to Tom,

11:17.494 --> 11:19.662
and it seems like he's ready
to be on his own.

11:19.663 --> 11:22.665
No, Tom can't be
totally on his own.

11:22.666 --> 11:24.901
I mean,
he needs help with stuff.

11:24.902 --> 11:27.370
You know, finances
and things like that. I--

11:27.371 --> 11:30.239
A lot of things.
I help Tom with a lot of things.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.610
Well, I guess his wife
would help with those things.

11:33.611 --> 11:36.145
Or, you know,
unless she needs help herself.

11:36.146 --> 11:38.915
I know she has children, so I assumed
she had some level of independence.

11:38.916 --> 11:41.551
What? You're jetlagged.

11:41.552 --> 11:44.554
Tom did not mention
his girlfriend having children.

11:44.555 --> 11:45.922
Well, maybe not to you, but--

11:45.923 --> 11:49.626
I'm sorry. His wife?
Jeff, he just met this girl.

11:49.627 --> 11:52.662
Well, you and I didn't know each
other that long when we got married.

11:52.663 --> 11:55.431
Yes, we did.

11:55.432 --> 11:58.067
Well, I think it's time for us to get
to know each other even better.

11:58.068 --> 12:01.037
Come on. Let's just pick up and go.
Just you and me.

12:01.038 --> 12:03.039
Or, if you want,
Tom and Grace can come, too.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.875
That's an amazing opportunity
for the two of them to see the world.

12:05.876 --> 12:08.511
You, too.
I've seen the world,

12:09.647 --> 12:12.882
and I'm not that impressed.

12:22.926 --> 12:24.927
[door closes]

12:24.928 --> 12:27.830
Adrian, Dr. Attavi's
ready for you.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.966
How are you? How are you feeling?
I feel okay.

12:29.967 --> 12:31.634
Well, come on back,
all right?

12:31.635 --> 12:34.003
All right. Let's go.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.571
[grunts]

12:35.572 --> 12:38.574
And we shouldn't call anyone now?
Not yet. It's too soon.

12:38.575 --> 12:40.943
I don't want some mob down here
from school while I'm giving birth.

12:40.944 --> 12:43.713
Why don't you give me
the phone numbers for your parents

12:43.714 --> 12:46.616
just in case you're busy later, and you
wanna get them down here?

12:46.617 --> 12:48.117
Okay.

12:48.118 --> 12:50.486
Uh, but my dad has
a big trial going on,

12:50.487 --> 12:53.856
and I think my mom's
doing some training today.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.358
She's a flight attendant.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.326
Security training.
You know how it is.

12:57.327 --> 12:58.795
Mm-hmm. Yep,
I know how it is.

12:58.796 --> 13:00.763
And, Ben,
your dad's around?

13:00.764 --> 13:03.833
Yeah. And I've got the list with us,
too, of everyone to call.

13:03.834 --> 13:05.334
Great.

13:05.335 --> 13:06.836
Hi, hon.
Hi.

13:06.837 --> 13:08.805
Anything new happen
in the past hour?

13:08.806 --> 13:10.807
Did you feel the baby move?
No.

13:10.808 --> 13:13.409
But I'm thinking maybe
she's just getting into position.

13:13.410 --> 13:16.279
You know, make her way out.
That would be my guess.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.413
Maybe she is.

13:17.414 --> 13:19.782
Hello, Ben.
How you doing this morning?

13:19.783 --> 13:21.284
Yeah. I'm doing okay.

13:21.285 --> 13:23.519
Okay. Let's see
what's going on.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.687
Okay.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.334
Hey, gorgeous.
Looking for someone?

13:44.335 --> 13:45.668
Hi.
Hi.

13:45.669 --> 13:47.036
I couldn't sleep
last night.

13:47.037 --> 13:49.139
Why not? I told you we don't
have to do anything.

13:49.140 --> 13:51.241
We're just getting away.
It'll be fun.

13:51.242 --> 13:53.109
I know that.
But I couldn't decide

13:53.110 --> 13:54.777
what to wear--
what to take to sleep in.

13:54.778 --> 13:56.379
I don't have time
to worry about all that.

13:56.380 --> 13:58.047
Well, you shouldn't worry
about all that.

13:58.048 --> 14:00.783
I don't care what you wear
or what you don't wear.

14:02.119 --> 14:04.454
I like you a lot.

14:04.455 --> 14:06.289
I thought you loved me.

14:06.290 --> 14:07.790
Well, we're at school.

14:07.791 --> 14:09.626
You know how you are
with personal things at school.

14:09.627 --> 14:12.395
Yeah, well, we don't need everyone
here knowing our business.

14:12.396 --> 14:14.564
They know too much
about us anyway.

14:14.565 --> 14:16.065
I know.

14:16.066 --> 14:18.168
I like it when we
can be by ourselves.

14:18.169 --> 14:20.703
Away someplace
where no one knows us.

14:20.704 --> 14:22.205
Like when we
were in New York.

14:22.206 --> 14:24.741
I mean,
outside my apartment building.

14:24.742 --> 14:26.342
No one knew us.
Yeah.

14:26.343 --> 14:29.379
I like New York, and I wouldn't
mind living in New York.

14:29.380 --> 14:32.615
Mm-hmm. Except I like
living so close to our families

14:32.616 --> 14:34.751
so they can help us with John,
like tonight.

14:34.752 --> 14:37.053
Yeah, that's a definite bonus.

14:41.959 --> 14:43.426
I thought they
were breaking up.

14:43.427 --> 14:45.461
That doesn't look
like breaking up.

14:45.462 --> 14:47.497
[laughs]
I'm glad they're not breaking up.

14:47.498 --> 14:49.165
Why?
I don't know.

14:49.166 --> 14:51.100
They're both kind of goofy.

14:51.101 --> 14:54.137
[laughing] They seem like
they belong together.

14:55.706 --> 14:58.508
What about us?
Do we seem like we belong together?

14:58.509 --> 15:00.343
Too personal for school.

15:00.344 --> 15:01.844
Really?

15:01.845 --> 15:03.913
No.

15:06.817 --> 15:08.851
Why do I always get
that scary feeling

15:08.852 --> 15:10.853
in the pit of my stomach
when we're making out,

15:10.854 --> 15:12.989
and I know that we're not gonna do
anything more than make out?

15:12.990 --> 15:16.025
I don't know. Are you scared
we'll change our minds?

15:16.026 --> 15:19.262
Are you gonna change your mind?
No, I'm not. I love you.

15:20.364 --> 15:21.931
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

15:21.932 --> 15:24.467
My dad gave me 50 bucks and told
us we should go out for dinner.

15:24.468 --> 15:26.002
And he'll pay for it?

15:26.003 --> 15:27.971
Yeah. Because we're not
having sex again.

15:27.972 --> 15:29.906
"Again"?
Well, yeah.

15:29.907 --> 15:32.709
I told him we had sex.
I'm surprised I didn't get a call.

15:32.710 --> 15:33.876
Oh, no. He's okay.

15:33.877 --> 15:35.812
I find that a little difficult
to believe.

15:35.813 --> 15:38.848
Well, he'd still love me
even if we were having sex.

15:38.849 --> 15:41.484
But the fact that we decided
not to have sex--

15:41.485 --> 15:43.886
Well, now he loves me
and he thinks I'm smart,

15:43.887 --> 15:46.623
and that I make good decisions
and all kinds of good stuff,

15:46.624 --> 15:48.891
and it just
makes me feel good.

15:48.892 --> 15:50.760
What does your dad think?

15:56.133 --> 15:58.067
Disgusting.

15:58.068 --> 16:00.003
For two people
not having sex,

16:00.004 --> 16:02.338
they can't keep
their hands off each other.

16:02.339 --> 16:03.806
It's school.

16:03.807 --> 16:06.609
This is not
the place for that.

16:06.610 --> 16:08.344
I wish it was
a place for that,

16:08.345 --> 16:11.014
'cause I'd like to make out
with you right now.

16:11.015 --> 16:13.283
We have to break up.

16:14.652 --> 16:17.053
All right.
[scoffs]

16:17.054 --> 16:19.555
If we have to break up,
I guess we have to break up.

16:19.556 --> 16:22.125
And you're just gonna let me go,
just like that?

16:22.126 --> 16:24.661
Yeah, if that's what you want.

16:24.662 --> 16:26.896
Well, that's what I want
if that's what you want.

16:27.998 --> 16:30.300
Yeah. That's what I want.

16:33.537 --> 16:35.038
Rats.

16:35.039 --> 16:37.407
They're late again.
Yeah.

16:37.408 --> 16:39.409
I think they're gonna be late
the rest of the school year.

16:39.410 --> 16:41.077
They're allowed.
They're having a baby.

16:41.078 --> 16:43.212
Call him.
I'm not gonna call him.

16:43.213 --> 16:45.782
Just because you had some dream
about broken glass

16:45.783 --> 16:47.850
doesn't mean
that something is wrong.

16:47.851 --> 16:50.186
No, it could mean that all
the pieces are coming together.

16:50.187 --> 16:52.188
It could be a good thing.
Or it could mean

16:52.189 --> 16:54.223
that the whole thing is falling apart,
which could be a bad thing.

16:54.224 --> 16:55.591
Or it could mean nothing.

16:55.592 --> 16:57.093
No, I think it means something.

16:57.094 --> 16:59.495
It wasn't just glass.
It was mirrored glass.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.864
Oh, well, then that's completely
different. Why didn't you say so?

17:01.865 --> 17:05.501
Fine. I'm calling him.
What are you gonna say?

17:05.502 --> 17:08.503
That you had one of your crazy dreams
and you wanna make sure he's okay?

17:08.505 --> 17:10.205
Dreams are like movies.

17:10.207 --> 17:12.241
Sometimes they mean something,
sometimes they don't.

17:12.242 --> 17:15.111
My dreams always mean something.
I just don't know what.

17:15.112 --> 17:17.512
Call your grandmother.
Or text her.

17:17.513 --> 17:20.383
Do not text Ben saying that you had
a dream. He'll freak out.

17:20.384 --> 17:22.585
All right.
You're probably right.

17:22.586 --> 17:24.587
We'll find out soon enough
what it meant.

17:24.588 --> 17:26.089
Or not.

17:30.694 --> 17:32.662
Hey. Bye.
I'll see you later.

17:32.663 --> 17:34.030
I'm really looking forward
to dinner.

17:34.031 --> 17:35.932
I haven't even
called her yet.

17:35.933 --> 17:37.533
I don't even know
if she'll go.

17:37.534 --> 17:40.136
I mean, why would she wanna come
to dinner with me and my new girlfriend?

17:40.137 --> 17:42.105
It's not like she has a new boyfriend
to bring with her.

17:42.106 --> 17:44.474
Well, is there some reason
you don't want us to be friends?

17:45.676 --> 17:46.709
No.

17:46.710 --> 17:48.878
Your friends
with my ex-boyfriend.

17:48.879 --> 17:51.347
Yeah, I knew
that was a mistake.

17:51.348 --> 17:53.750
I'll see you later.
Call her.

17:53.751 --> 17:55.852
Okay, here's the thing.

17:55.853 --> 17:58.287
She has some eating issues, so--

17:58.288 --> 18:01.023
You told me she lost a bunch of
weight when you guys broke up.

18:01.024 --> 18:02.525
What kind
of eating issues are they?

18:02.526 --> 18:04.227
Is she anorexic or bulimic
or something?

18:04.228 --> 18:06.062
No, nothing like that.

18:06.063 --> 18:08.998
She just watches
what she eats very carefully.

18:08.999 --> 18:11.534
So a meal at a restaurant
might be an issue.

18:11.535 --> 18:14.070
I don't know.
[bell ringing]

18:14.071 --> 18:16.406
I gotta go. But call her.
Text her. We don't have to eat.

18:16.407 --> 18:19.175
We can do something else.
Bye.

18:23.647 --> 18:26.716
Did you know anything about this?
I did not.

18:26.717 --> 18:28.951
I wonder where they got
a crazy idea like this.

18:28.952 --> 18:30.186
Are you suggesting me?

18:30.187 --> 18:33.389
No. No, I'm not suggesting
or accusing.

18:33.390 --> 18:34.757
I just wonder.

18:34.758 --> 18:36.659
Where they got
a crazy idea like this,

18:36.660 --> 18:37.994
so you said.

18:37.995 --> 18:39.829
I don't think it's
necessarily a bad thing.

18:39.830 --> 18:41.531
You don't?

18:41.532 --> 18:43.032
They're both very smart.

18:43.033 --> 18:44.801
And a little antisocial.

18:44.802 --> 18:46.969
Yes, but so was I,
and I graduated from Oxford.

18:46.970 --> 18:48.204
Yeah, and now you're here.

18:48.205 --> 18:50.206
That's because I followed
the girl of my dreams

18:50.207 --> 18:53.142
back to California, and we both
happen to be very happy now.

18:53.143 --> 18:56.646
I see.
And did you tell our two lovebirds this?

18:56.647 --> 18:58.448
I-- I might have.

18:58.449 --> 19:00.550
It was a cautionary tale.

19:00.551 --> 19:02.817
What's cautionary about you
following the girl

19:02.842 --> 19:04.294
of your dreams to California?

19:04.388 --> 19:06.956
I'm stuck here now.
We have children.

19:06.957 --> 19:09.725
The children have children.
We can't get away.

19:09.726 --> 19:12.128
There's no place to hide
and no place to go.

19:12.129 --> 19:14.997
I can see where
that might've led to this.

19:14.998 --> 19:17.400
I think I better

19:17.401 --> 19:19.469
give George Juergens a call.

19:19.470 --> 19:20.870
And blame me for this?

19:20.871 --> 19:23.406
Actually, I might,

19:23.407 --> 19:24.941
because I made a big mistake

19:24.942 --> 19:26.609
that I just found out about
this morning,

19:26.610 --> 19:28.211
and I don't need
another one.

19:28.212 --> 19:29.545
[scoffs]

19:29.546 --> 19:31.447
I didn't know

19:31.448 --> 19:33.516
that Adrian and Ricky
applied to the same schools.

19:33.517 --> 19:35.551
I helped Ricky apply
to some of the same schools

19:35.552 --> 19:38.688
without even thinking about checking
to see if Adrian applied there,

19:38.689 --> 19:39.889
and...
[sighs]

19:39.890 --> 19:41.757
she got into the same school
Ricky got into.

19:43.026 --> 19:46.028
You have no idea

19:46.029 --> 19:47.597
what I'm referring to,
do you?

19:47.598 --> 19:49.599
No, I have no idea
to what you refer.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.167
I told you, I have a life.

19:54.771 --> 19:57.440
[huffs]

19:57.441 --> 20:00.176
[phone ringing]
[sighs]

20:05.849 --> 20:07.683
Want me to get that?
Or I could get it.

20:07.684 --> 20:09.585
I'd be happy to get it,
if you want.

20:09.586 --> 20:12.154
I don't want anyone to get it.
I don't care who it is.

20:12.155 --> 20:14.290
It couldn't be more interesting
than this conversation.

20:14.291 --> 20:15.791
You tested
out of high school?

20:15.792 --> 20:18.261
Yeah.
Yes, sir.

20:18.262 --> 20:21.330
Well, we just did it
as an experiment, and then--

20:21.331 --> 20:24.300
Well, who knew we'd do so well?
Certainly not me, sir.

20:24.301 --> 20:25.628
This doesn't mean
you're dropping out of school.

20:25.653 --> 20:26.769
You're not dropping out of school.

20:26.770 --> 20:28.538
Oh, no.
No, not at all, sir.

20:28.539 --> 20:30.206
I hope we didn't
give you that impression.

20:30.207 --> 20:31.607
But we are dropping out.

20:31.608 --> 20:33.743
Oh, and I want
emancipation status.

20:33.744 --> 20:35.745
What? No. No.

20:35.746 --> 20:38.047
You're not gonna get emancipated.
That's never gonna happen.

20:39.616 --> 20:41.250
Are you emancipated?

20:41.251 --> 20:44.020
No. But my parents said
they do not object

20:44.021 --> 20:46.756
to no longer being
legally responsible for me.

20:46.757 --> 20:48.958
They were kind of excited,
actually.

20:50.394 --> 20:52.495
I mean, if I go, you can go, too.
Go where?

20:52.496 --> 20:54.764
Wherever you want.
I can't go wherever I want.

20:54.765 --> 20:56.499
Neither can you. Or you.

20:56.500 --> 21:00.069
It's just, we were thinking
about driving across America.

21:00.070 --> 21:02.805
She doesn't drive.
I can learn.

21:02.806 --> 21:07.109
It would just be more
interesting than, you know...

21:07.110 --> 21:09.946
Hanging around here
watching you raise Amy

21:09.947 --> 21:13.115
and Amy raise John and Mom raise
Robie and you raise Robie,

21:13.116 --> 21:16.953
and whatever other children you or she
decide to have or include in your lives.

21:16.954 --> 21:20.856
Like that son of of her boyfriend
that Amy made out with at one time.

21:20.857 --> 21:23.359
Or, for example, in your case,
Grace and Tom.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.328
I had dinner with the woman.

21:25.329 --> 21:28.164
Yeah, the woman who you
were once married to.

21:28.165 --> 21:30.433
Yeah, I know.

21:30.434 --> 21:32.401
Look, Dad,
I'm almost grown up,

21:32.402 --> 21:34.971
and I have things that I wanna
do and places I wanna go.

21:34.972 --> 21:38.040
But you are not grown up.
And neither are you.

21:39.977 --> 21:41.577
Does your mother know
anything about this?

21:47.951 --> 21:51.621
Hey, was Dr. Attavi looking for me?
Allison Attavi?

21:51.622 --> 21:53.356
Yeah, she might
need your help.

21:53.357 --> 21:54.790
With?

21:57.661 --> 21:59.695
What's the problem?

22:07.070 --> 22:08.838
[crying]

22:25.689 --> 22:27.657
So,

22:27.658 --> 22:29.959
I haven't seen you
in a while.

22:29.960 --> 22:31.961
Yeah, it's been a while.

22:31.962 --> 22:33.596
How are you?

22:34.698 --> 22:36.298
Not good.

22:37.801 --> 22:39.835
Not good at all.

22:39.836 --> 22:42.204
She's gonna be okay, Ben.

22:43.607 --> 22:45.608
Yeah, she probably will,

22:45.609 --> 22:47.910
but I don't know about me.

22:49.146 --> 22:51.080
I don't know
if I'm gonna be okay.

22:52.649 --> 22:54.917
You're gonna need your friends
and family right now.

22:56.553 --> 22:59.321
I don't understand
how this could happen.

23:01.958 --> 23:04.660
We were with
Dr. Attavi yesterday.

23:06.163 --> 23:08.230
Yesterday everything was fine.

23:10.934 --> 23:12.868
Everything was fine.

23:24.393 --> 23:27.062
Thanks.
Oh, is that your wife?

23:27.063 --> 23:29.364
I'm not married.
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:29.365 --> 23:30.443
I thought you were
the guy with the kid.

23:30.468 --> 23:31.668
Must be the other guy.

23:31.834 --> 23:33.635
It's both of us.
He got married,

23:33.636 --> 23:36.037
and I'll probably do the same
at some point.

23:36.038 --> 23:37.139
All right.

23:40.776 --> 23:42.911
Good afternoon, Amy.

23:42.912 --> 23:44.112
Hi, Bunny.

23:44.113 --> 23:45.780
Someone looks happy.

23:45.781 --> 23:48.116
I am. I am happy.

23:48.117 --> 23:50.051
Actually, I was talking
about your guy over there.

23:50.052 --> 23:52.053
You think?
I think.

23:52.054 --> 23:55.190
I think that he's so happy
that I don't think

23:55.191 --> 23:57.259
he can concentrate
on his work.

23:57.260 --> 23:59.094
Maybe I should
go wait upstairs.

23:59.095 --> 24:01.263
That's probably a good idea
since there are so many

24:01.264 --> 24:02.964
sharp objects
around the shop here.

24:02.965 --> 24:05.433
My mom's upstairs.
Go on up if you want.

24:05.434 --> 24:07.402
Bye.
Bye.

24:10.806 --> 24:12.340
I hope you know
what you're doing.

24:12.341 --> 24:13.975
I don't know
what I'm doing.

24:13.976 --> 24:15.577
I just know
that I love that girl.

24:15.578 --> 24:17.512
And she loves you.

24:17.513 --> 24:19.514
Go ahead. Take off.
I got it.

24:19.515 --> 24:21.917
Did Ben ever call in?
Haven't heard a thing.

24:21.918 --> 24:24.619
I guess they'd let someone know
if she's having the baby, right?

24:24.620 --> 24:26.288
I guess they would.
Yeah.

24:26.289 --> 24:27.923
I just can't be too upset
with him

24:27.924 --> 24:30.425
'cause I'm kind o.

24:30.426 --> 24:33.795
And I'm proud of you, too.

24:39.302 --> 24:40.769
Nora?

24:44.073 --> 24:46.341
Amy!

24:46.342 --> 24:48.677
Hey, how are you?

24:48.678 --> 24:50.312
I'm good.
I'm really good.

24:50.313 --> 24:53.148
How are you? Look at you.
You look beautiful.

24:53.149 --> 24:54.716
So do you.

24:54.717 --> 24:57.018
[singsong voice]
The two of us.
We're beautiful girls.

24:57.019 --> 24:59.020
And you do look like me.

24:59.021 --> 25:01.790
Oh, jeez.
To have 17 back again.

25:01.791 --> 25:02.924
Oh.
[laughs]

25:02.925 --> 25:06.161
You're so funny.
I miss seeing you.

25:06.162 --> 25:08.496
Well, you know what?
I will, uh, call Ollie,

25:08.497 --> 25:09.998
and I'll cancel our date,

25:09.999 --> 25:12.701
and then I'll just hang out
with you and Ricky tonight.

25:12.702 --> 25:14.603
[chuckles]
I'm kidding.

25:14.604 --> 25:17.339
I know you're off
to your big sleepover.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.809
Where are you and Ollie
off to tonight?

25:20.810 --> 25:22.277
You know, I'd love
to meet her sometime.

25:22.278 --> 25:24.980
Oh, I'd love
for you to meet her.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.982
Oh, did Ricky tell you
we're, um--

25:26.983 --> 25:28.516
we're thinking
of getting married?

25:28.517 --> 25:31.286
Yes, he told me!
He's really happy for you.

25:31.287 --> 25:32.654
Yeah?
Yeah.

25:32.655 --> 25:35.023
Well, I'm a little nervous.
I mean, just thinking

25:35.024 --> 25:37.025
about spending the rest
of my life with someone

25:37.026 --> 25:39.194
just seems like a long,
long time.

25:39.195 --> 25:42.197
Yeah. Well, I mean,
I guess you just have to take it

25:42.198 --> 25:44.199
like you take every other
challenge in your life--

25:44.200 --> 25:45.567
one day at a time.

25:45.568 --> 25:46.901
I'll be darned.

25:46.902 --> 25:49.170
You're a genius.
That's why he loves you.

25:49.171 --> 25:51.072
I mean, you're beautiful,
but you're a genius.

25:51.073 --> 25:53.375
And I'm the mother
of his son.

25:53.376 --> 25:55.343
Oh, you know what?

25:55.344 --> 25:58.880
He'd love you whether or not John
was ever part of the picture.

25:58.881 --> 26:02.150
Yeah, well, that's one thing
that I'll never know.

26:02.151 --> 26:04.352
No, honey. You'll know.

26:04.353 --> 26:07.155
Yeah, when John's 18
and out of the house,

26:07.156 --> 26:09.057
and you and Ricky
are planning

26:09.058 --> 26:12.394
another one of your romantic
road trips, you'll know.

26:12.395 --> 26:14.396
I mean, you'll have to wait
another, what,

26:14.397 --> 26:17.899
17 years probably,
but you'll know.
[chuckles]

26:19.201 --> 26:21.536
Just be really careful
driving, okay?

26:21.537 --> 26:24.105
I don't know what I'd do
if anything happened

26:24.106 --> 26:25.774
to either one of you.

26:25.775 --> 26:28.276
Nothing's gonna happen to either of us.
I promise.

26:28.277 --> 26:30.812
Oh, I hope not.

26:32.081 --> 26:34.082
I hope I, uh--

26:34.083 --> 26:37.485
I never have to see another...

26:37.486 --> 26:39.688
bad thing happen to my son

26:39.689 --> 26:42.424
for as long as I live.

26:42.425 --> 26:44.926
And you're a good thing,
you know?

26:44.927 --> 26:48.630
Amy Juergens,
you're the best thing--

26:48.631 --> 26:50.565
You're the best thing
that ever happened to him.

26:52.401 --> 26:53.935
Thank you.

26:53.936 --> 26:55.937
I love you.

26:58.140 --> 27:00.141
I love you, too.
[laughing]

27:00.142 --> 27:03.011
Look, you know what?
Do me a favor.

27:03.012 --> 27:06.414
When you guys get married,
you call me Mom,

27:06.415 --> 27:09.851
and you call Margaret
The Other Mom, okay?

27:09.852 --> 27:11.686
[knocking]

27:11.687 --> 27:13.288
I heard that.

27:13.289 --> 27:15.924
Oh, I heard you
at the top of the stairs.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.125
Hi, Amy.

27:17.126 --> 27:18.460
Hi, Margaret.

27:18.461 --> 27:21.029
Margaret and I
are meeting Ollie.

27:21.030 --> 27:22.764
I invited Margaret
to come along.

27:22.765 --> 27:24.899
Because we're friends.
You see,

27:24.900 --> 27:27.268
even after everything
that's happened over the years,

27:27.269 --> 27:30.038
Ricky's mother
and I are friends.

27:30.039 --> 27:33.541
And Ricky's mother and me--
we're friends, too.

27:33.542 --> 27:36.411
Oh. And I hope to be
friends with both of you.

27:36.412 --> 27:39.581
I mean, you know, if things work out
between Ricky and me in the future.

27:39.582 --> 27:42.384
Well, we can all be friends
no matter how things work out

27:42.385 --> 27:44.219
for you and Ricky
in the future.

27:44.220 --> 27:46.688
I respect you, Amy, and you're
the kind of young woman

27:46.689 --> 27:48.189
I would like
to be friends with.

27:49.725 --> 27:52.894
So, friend Nora,
let's get going.

27:52.895 --> 27:54.258
We don't want to be late.

27:54.283 --> 27:55.855
It's kind of hard to get
into this restaurant.

27:55.865 --> 27:57.298
Yeah. Okay. Bye.

27:57.299 --> 27:59.834
Um, have a really
nice time, okay?

27:59.835 --> 28:01.336
And be careful.

28:01.337 --> 28:02.804
Very careful.

28:04.240 --> 28:07.108
Oh, yeah.
I know about the plans.

28:07.109 --> 28:10.078
I'm just saying.
We'll see you soon.

28:10.079 --> 28:11.880
Bye.
[laughs]

28:16.619 --> 28:18.086
[door closes]

28:22.458 --> 28:25.427
That was Ben.
Is everything okay?

28:25.428 --> 28:27.962
No, everything's not okay.
They've been at the hospital all day,

28:27.963 --> 28:29.764
and he's just now calling me.

28:29.765 --> 28:31.966
What happened? I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

28:31.967 --> 28:34.102
I have to get down there.
Do you want me to go with you?

28:34.103 --> 28:35.970
I didn't think you were
even speaking to me.

28:35.971 --> 28:38.540
Just because you don't want me
to go out with George Juergens?

28:38.541 --> 28:40.542
Come on, Leo. We've been
friends half my life.

28:40.543 --> 28:43.011
I don't know what's going on, but
whatever it is, I'm there for you.

28:43.012 --> 28:45.013
No. Be here for me.

28:45.014 --> 28:47.782
Be here in case I need you
to do something.

28:47.783 --> 28:49.284
Get a car out to the airport.

28:49.285 --> 28:51.986
Adrian's mom's out there
taking some kind of a class.

28:51.987 --> 28:54.489
Ruben will know where she is.
I'll call the airline.

28:54.490 --> 28:57.292
What airline does she even work for?
I don't know how to get in touch with her.

28:57.293 --> 29:00.628
I know which airline, and I'll get in
touch with her. What else can I do?

29:00.629 --> 29:04.165
I don't know.
I-I-I just don't know yet.

29:06.802 --> 29:09.504
Uh, call Betty.
Tell Betty to call me.

29:09.505 --> 29:11.372
I don't want to have to
track her down, all right?

29:11.373 --> 29:12.907
[bell dings]
Tell her to wait by the phone.

29:14.243 --> 29:16.177
And I'll talk to you later,
Camille.

29:16.178 --> 29:19.180
I'll call you as soon as I know
how serious this is, all right?

29:19.181 --> 29:21.049
You know, I'm sure
everything will be fine.

29:21.050 --> 29:24.752
And if it's not,
then you'll make it fine.

29:24.753 --> 29:27.322
[bell dings]
I really don't know if I can.

29:28.691 --> 29:30.625
I love you, Leo.

29:39.401 --> 29:41.336
[buzzing]

29:43.706 --> 29:45.840
Adrian, let me
take it for you.
[beeps]

29:45.841 --> 29:47.275
Hello?

29:48.511 --> 29:50.178
Hi, Tom.

29:50.179 --> 29:52.480
No, I-I can't talk
right now.

29:52.481 --> 29:54.582
I'm in the hospital, Tom.

29:56.652 --> 29:58.453
[beeps]

30:17.006 --> 30:18.339
Oh, God.

30:30.366 --> 30:32.049
See you, suckers.

30:32.050 --> 30:33.284
See you, Tom.

30:33.285 --> 30:35.419
Or Dad. I mean,

30:35.420 --> 30:37.321
well, whatever you want us
to call you.

30:37.322 --> 30:39.556
Hey, Tom, are you
getting off or not?

30:39.557 --> 30:41.892
Just a second.
You better hurry, my love.

30:41.893 --> 30:43.727
Sorry to get off before you.

30:43.728 --> 30:46.630
That's okay. You go.
We'll see you tomorrow.

30:53.138 --> 30:54.772
Is he really going to marry you?
[door closes]

30:54.773 --> 30:57.374
I doubt it, but I'm gonna
try and make it work.

30:57.375 --> 30:59.743
He's a nice guy.
And your dad is not.

31:02.747 --> 31:04.748
And no one's heard
from them all day?

31:04.749 --> 31:07.685
No. I called her, and I texted
her, and I didn't get an answer.

31:07.686 --> 31:09.787
Maybe she's having the baby.

31:09.788 --> 31:12.056
If she was having the baby,
I think we would know about it.

31:13.158 --> 31:15.793
Grant, is this your Grace?

31:15.794 --> 31:18.896
Hey, Angie.
How are you?

31:18.897 --> 31:21.532
I'm better now that I'm getting
to meet the love of your life.

31:22.767 --> 31:25.336
Hi. It's so nice
to meet you.

31:25.337 --> 31:28.639
I'm-- I'm Grace.
And you must be fat.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.341
Grace!
I must be.

31:30.342 --> 31:31.709
Oh, dear God.

31:31.710 --> 31:33.510
It's all right.
I'm fat.

31:33.511 --> 31:35.713
I am fat,
but I've lost a few pounds.

31:35.714 --> 31:38.749
Yeah, you have.
You look great.

31:38.750 --> 31:40.951
Found the magic beans
you were looking for?

31:40.952 --> 31:43.187
No, I actually gave in
to reality.

31:43.188 --> 31:44.855
You know,
took my doctor's advice,

31:44.856 --> 31:46.623
started cutting down
and exercising.

31:46.624 --> 31:49.560
All that boring stuff.
[chuckles]

31:49.561 --> 31:51.995
Why don't you sit
over there with Grace?

31:51.996 --> 31:53.497
And I'll sit over here.

31:53.498 --> 31:56.100
Angie, I don't even know why I
would say something like that.

31:56.101 --> 31:58.369
It's okay.
He likes them fat,

31:58.370 --> 32:00.938
and he likes them small,
and he likes them short,

32:00.939 --> 32:02.272
and he likes them tall.

32:02.273 --> 32:04.208
Grant's a ladies' man.
He loves women.

32:04.209 --> 32:07.144
And I'm a woman, and he
loved me, and I loved him.

32:07.145 --> 32:10.013
But, alas, it's over,
and we've moved on.

32:10.014 --> 32:13.083
Well, at least he has,
and I'm still trying.

32:15.387 --> 32:17.254
And you didn't think
you should come and tell me?

32:17.255 --> 32:19.523
I'm here, and I just
got home from practice.

32:19.524 --> 32:21.425
Practice ran late.
And I figured Grace told you.

32:21.426 --> 32:22.826
I don't think Grace knows.

32:22.827 --> 32:24.194
I don't think we even know,
do we?

32:24.195 --> 32:25.963
Well, he told you.
He told Jeff.

32:25.964 --> 32:27.131
He told Jeff?

32:27.132 --> 32:29.032
He's home.

32:29.033 --> 32:31.902
He wants to go back to Africa and
drag us all with him, but he's home.

32:31.903 --> 32:33.404
Cool.
Not cool.

32:33.405 --> 32:34.905
I don't want to go to Africa.

32:34.906 --> 32:36.840
Yeah, but you
don't really want

32:36.841 --> 32:38.709
to be married
a fourth time, do you?

32:38.710 --> 32:40.210
You know what?
No, I don't.

32:40.211 --> 32:42.212
And I love Jeff.
But Africa?

32:42.213 --> 32:45.282
And we're not talking about me.
We're talking about Tom.

32:45.283 --> 32:48.118
Who is this woman with two
children that wants to marry Tom?

32:48.119 --> 32:49.920
I mean, is she after
his money or something?

32:49.921 --> 32:51.555
Does he have money?

32:51.556 --> 32:54.091
Yes, he has money.
He has a lot of money.

32:54.092 --> 32:55.659
I didn't know.

32:55.660 --> 32:57.161
I didn't say she could.

32:57.162 --> 32:59.797
I did not say that you could
drop out of high school

32:59.798 --> 33:01.665
and drive across the country
with your boyfriend.

33:01.666 --> 33:04.168
He's not my boyfriend,
and I'm not dropping out.

33:04.169 --> 33:06.737
I finished.
I'm a high school graduate.

33:06.738 --> 33:09.606
I passed the GED.
I'm free.

33:09.607 --> 33:12.276
I'm just asking to make it
official and emancipate m

33:12.277 --> 33:13.644
No.

33:13.645 --> 33:15.379
Let me speak to your father
alone, please.

33:15.380 --> 33:17.748
Look, I don't want
to be in a situation

33:17.749 --> 33:20.284
where I'm forced
to run away from home.

33:20.285 --> 33:22.419
Just let me do
what I want to do.

33:22.420 --> 33:24.087
I'm not doing anything wrong.

33:24.088 --> 33:26.290
I'm doing something
that's educational

33:26.291 --> 33:28.625
and could profoundly impact
my life in a good way.

33:29.928 --> 33:31.261
What am I supposed to do?

33:31.262 --> 33:33.730
Just stay here and wait
until I get pregnant, too?

33:39.637 --> 33:42.005
I did not know about this.
I swear.

33:42.006 --> 33:45.142
She said that she was thinking
about taking the GED.

33:45.143 --> 33:48.212
She asked about it, but I never
thought that she would do it,

33:48.213 --> 33:50.247
and I certainly didn't think
that she would pass.

33:50.248 --> 33:51.615
She passed.

33:51.616 --> 33:53.951
[sighs]
Where's Amy?

33:53.952 --> 33:56.453
Shouldn't she be home by now?
Did she know anything about this?

33:56.454 --> 33:57.921
She's too busy not having sex

33:57.922 --> 33:59.490
to pay attention
to any of this.

33:59.491 --> 34:02.125
That's why I
have John tonight.

34:02.126 --> 34:04.461
She drove up to some little town
to spend the night with Ricky.

34:04.462 --> 34:05.377
But they're not gonna have sex.

34:05.381 --> 34:06.881
It's just a little getaway
for the two of them.

34:06.931 --> 34:09.500
They're not gonna have sex?
That's what she said.

34:09.501 --> 34:12.168
And you believed her?
I believe that is the plan.

34:12.170 --> 34:14.771
I do not believe they're not gonna have sex.
If not tonight, then another night.

34:14.772 --> 34:18.175
What about you?
Are you gonna have sex with your ex?

34:18.176 --> 34:20.511
Do you mean you
or someone else?

34:20.512 --> 34:22.246
Someone else.

34:23.514 --> 34:24.447
Kathleen.

34:26.083 --> 34:27.451
Honestly?

34:27.452 --> 34:28.552
Yeah.

34:28.553 --> 34:31.121
If I ever get the chance.

34:31.121 --> 34:32.856
[scoffs]

34:39.297 --> 34:40.464
[chuckles]

34:40.465 --> 34:44.034
Well, the traffic
should be cleared up by now.

34:44.034 --> 34:45.802
Maybe we should go.
Are you sure?

34:46.905 --> 34:49.206
Well, traffic might not

34:49.206 --> 34:51.041
be cleared up for hours.

34:51.042 --> 34:53.710
There's a wreck on the 405.
A bad wreck.

35:01.019 --> 35:02.352
I have an idea.

35:02.353 --> 35:04.488
I think you had an idea
when I came through the door.

35:04.489 --> 35:06.189
What's going on with you?

35:06.190 --> 35:08.258
You know,
we don't have to go anywhere.

35:08.259 --> 35:11.061
If you don't even wanna spend
the night with me, that's okay.

35:11.062 --> 35:14.097
I mean, you seem all right
about making out here,

35:14.098 --> 35:16.433
but it doesn't seem
as if you wanna leave here.

35:16.434 --> 35:18.335
Are you still nervous?

35:18.336 --> 35:21.271
I don't know.
I can't tell.

35:21.272 --> 35:25.042
I mean, I'm nervous,
but I'm excited.

35:25.043 --> 35:27.210
It's just once
we get in the car--

35:27.211 --> 35:29.313
Once we get in the car,
we're just gonna drive somewhere

35:29.314 --> 35:31.949
and spend the night together
and not do anything.

35:31.950 --> 35:35.185
Just like we planned.
So there's no reason to be nervous.

35:35.186 --> 35:37.321
I'm a very safe driver.
[laughs]

35:46.297 --> 35:48.999
Now is not the time
to yell at me.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.969
Now is the time to go
to the hospital.

35:51.970 --> 35:54.204
Go to the hospital for what?
Who's in the hospital?

35:54.205 --> 35:56.206
Who else? Adrian.

35:56.207 --> 35:57.808
Adrian's having a baby!

36:00.812 --> 36:03.080
Adrian's having the baby.

[squeals]

36:09.721 --> 36:11.888
Adrian's having the baby.

36:11.889 --> 36:14.224
Yes!

36:14.225 --> 36:17.327
Just letting you know
that Adrian's having a baby.

36:20.331 --> 36:22.199
[cell phones ringing]

36:26.604 --> 36:28.939
[together]
Adrian's having the baby.

36:31.461 --> 36:33.495
And they don't know
what caused it?

36:33.529 --> 36:35.297
No.

36:35.331 --> 36:37.199
They don't know.

36:37.233 --> 36:40.636
They said in about 30 percent
of the cases they never know.

36:41.571 --> 36:43.438
Did you see her?

36:45.141 --> 36:47.209
Yeah, Dad.

36:47.243 --> 36:49.444
They let me see her.

36:50.380 --> 36:51.980
They let me hold her,

36:52.015 --> 36:55.517
and then they let Adrian
hold her when she woke up.

36:56.519 --> 36:57.953
Oh, Ben.

36:57.987 --> 37:01.456
Oh, Ben,
I'm so sorry, son.

37:02.492 --> 37:04.626
I'm so sorry.

37:39.929 --> 37:42.030
It's my fault.

37:43.700 --> 37:46.735
I never should've
let her do this.

37:49.405 --> 37:51.239
It's my fault.

37:51.274 --> 37:53.442
No, it's not your fault.

37:55.578 --> 37:58.046
The doctors say
it's not anybody's fault.

I didn't do anything wrong.
That's what they told me.

The doctors said I didn't--

38:25.775 --> 38:28.110
I didn't do anything wrong.

38:28.144 --> 38:29.678
I know that.

I know that, Adrian.
I know that.
