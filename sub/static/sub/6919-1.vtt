WEBVTT

00:53.115 --> 00:54.416
Are we out of gas?

00:56.251 --> 00:58.220
You got to be kidding me!

00:58.253 --> 01:00.488
This cannot be how this ends. No!

01:31.586 --> 01:33.855
Steven?

01:35.089 --> 01:36.924
Steve? Steve?

01:36.958 --> 01:39.161
Vince, listen, I'm right in the middle of something here, man.

01:39.194 --> 01:41.229
What? The book? I thought you'd be done already.

01:41.263 --> 01:45.066
Yeah, yeah, so did I, and the deadline's coming. So could you just please...?

01:45.099 --> 01:47.702
You haven't been on the blogosphere in the last few hours, have you?

01:47.735 --> 01:51.173
No, Vince, I'm... I'm writing and I'm unplugged.

01:51.206 --> 01:54.842
Something's going on, man. Crazy stuff in the ether.

01:54.876 --> 01:58.112
Yeah, well, I think the ether's just gonna have to wait, Vince, because...

01:58.146 --> 02:01.349
Wait? What? No. People are freaking out, man.

02:01.383 --> 02:03.451
Doppler maps and stuff aren't working.

02:03.485 --> 02:07.322
Some crazy frequency is being picked up by the space stations.

02:07.355 --> 02:08.889
Do you know there's a school of dolphins

02:08.923 --> 02:11.793
Off the coast of Baja California...

02:11.826 --> 02:13.461
They all beached themselves.

02:13.495 --> 02:17.031
Vince, it's called a 24-hour news cycle.

02:17.064 --> 02:20.502
Please, I've got a lot I got to still do and...

02:20.535 --> 02:22.737
and I've got my call to make.

02:22.770 --> 02:24.071
Oh, yeah, the girls.

02:24.105 --> 02:25.807
Yes, Vince.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.242
You're still married, huh?

02:27.275 --> 02:29.411
Very funny.

02:29.444 --> 02:33.047
All this has made me so shaky. I got low blood sugar.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.116
I'm gonna just grab me a snack.

02:35.149 --> 02:37.151
No! Vince, go home.

02:37.185 --> 02:39.020
Don't... do...

02:44.559 --> 02:47.028
This find is a phantom.

02:47.061 --> 02:48.263
Look at the density calculations.

02:48.296 --> 02:49.764
They're all over the place.

02:49.797 --> 02:52.066
There cannot be this much natural gas in one area.

02:52.099 --> 02:54.469
You are funny.

02:54.502 --> 02:59.006
We should be drilling 600 miles south near the stratovolcano plate.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.576
Nancy, your data predicts

03:01.609 --> 03:04.546
A 260-trillion-cubic-foot natural gas find.

03:04.579 --> 03:06.113
Of course it's gonna be a mistake.

03:06.147 --> 03:09.817
Yeah, that's a mistake, right?

03:10.985 --> 03:12.520
There it is, the daily call.

03:12.554 --> 03:15.757
Say hi to Rachel. And Steve.

03:15.790 --> 03:18.760
I will. Don't go far. This won't take long.

03:18.793 --> 03:21.329
I'm right here.

03:23.130 --> 03:25.700
God, where are the other two? We're so late.

03:25.733 --> 03:28.202
We're gonna be so far back, we're probably not even gonna hear anything.

03:28.236 --> 03:32.507
Are you gonna complain or are you gonna help us pack up the car?

03:32.540 --> 03:34.008
I will.

03:34.041 --> 03:35.877
As soon as I get off my call.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.178
You're not on a call.

03:37.211 --> 03:39.881
But I am now.

03:43.551 --> 03:46.288
I'm almost finished and I think it's pretty good.

03:46.321 --> 03:49.223
Great. How does it end? Is it happy?

03:49.257 --> 03:51.726
Happy endings are so 1990s, sweetheart.

03:51.759 --> 03:54.496
Not true, Dad. Everyone likes a happy ending.

03:54.529 --> 03:58.165
Maybe in movies, but, Rachel, hey,

03:58.199 --> 03:59.534
I thought it was a concert you were going to.

03:59.567 --> 04:01.969
How come you are in a motel?

04:02.003 --> 04:05.707
Dad, it's not just a concert, it's Life Rock Music Festival.

04:05.740 --> 04:08.276
It's like a whole weekend band thing.

04:08.310 --> 04:10.445
Basically a stress reliever before finals.

04:10.478 --> 04:12.647
You should be stressed before finals.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.149
You should be studying before finals.

04:15.182 --> 04:17.051
Relief comes after.

04:17.084 --> 04:19.286
Hey, listen, speaking of after,

04:19.321 --> 04:22.357
We are not going to have Thanksgiving with Auntie Kathy.

04:22.390 --> 04:24.926
They can't make it, so it's just gonna be us turkeys.

04:24.959 --> 04:27.295
Yeah, um, about that.

04:27.329 --> 04:30.398
Allie kind of invited me skiing with her family so...

04:30.432 --> 04:34.569
Uh, come to think of it, uh, baby, um...

04:34.602 --> 04:36.504
It's gonna be tough for me, too.

04:36.538 --> 04:39.507
No, there's nothing tough about Thanksgiving.

04:39.541 --> 04:41.609
The only thing tough about Thanksgiving, Nancy,

04:41.643 --> 04:43.578
Will be the turkey if I have to cook it.

04:43.611 --> 04:46.714
I'm gonna be here six more months.

04:46.748 --> 04:48.816
Nancy.

04:48.850 --> 04:51.753
Listen, I'm not thrilled about it either, believe me, I'm not.

04:51.786 --> 04:53.588
But just think of it this way... The quicker I finish here,

04:53.621 --> 04:55.690
The quicker I can come back

04:55.723 --> 04:58.159
And I'm gonna be there through a long stretch through Christmas.

04:58.192 --> 05:01.162
I know, but something always changes.

05:01.195 --> 05:03.598
That'll change, you know, and we just...

05:03.631 --> 05:06.501
It seems like we never spend any time together anymore.

05:06.534 --> 05:09.704
So is that a yes on me skiing with Allie?

05:12.273 --> 05:13.841
Nan...

05:54.482 --> 05:55.883
Do you feel that?

05:55.917 --> 05:58.720
It's an earthquake, amigo.

05:58.753 --> 06:00.988
That's no earthquake.

06:02.089 --> 06:03.725
It's a sonic boom.

06:05.292 --> 06:06.661
See? See? I told you.

06:06.694 --> 06:09.196
Shut up for a second, would you?

06:32.019 --> 06:34.556
What the hell was that?

06:34.589 --> 06:35.790
I...

06:57.011 --> 06:58.279
What was that?

06:58.312 --> 06:59.747
Sounded like an accident.

06:59.781 --> 07:01.816
Come on, somebody might be hurt.

07:14.596 --> 07:16.698
Oh, my God. Run, run, run.

07:16.731 --> 07:18.900
Oh, my God! Run! Run! Run!

07:18.933 --> 07:22.937
Craig! Craig, come on! Oh, my God.

08:08.683 --> 08:10.284
The storm is moving away.

08:10.317 --> 08:12.353
You sure?

08:12.386 --> 08:14.822
Yeah. Yeah.

08:19.961 --> 08:23.230
I can't get a damn thing on this.

08:23.264 --> 08:25.132
Just let it be, Vince.

08:33.107 --> 08:34.676
Oh, no, no, no.

08:34.708 --> 08:37.979
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

08:38.011 --> 08:41.749
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

08:41.783 --> 08:44.284
No.

08:48.489 --> 08:50.992
Come on, come on, not now, please.

08:52.359 --> 08:54.662
Are you sure we're out of gas?

09:00.534 --> 09:03.705
Why don't you turn that alarm off, Steve?

09:06.473 --> 09:08.710
You know why, Vince.

09:08.743 --> 09:10.712
Because I'm never gonna give up.

09:10.745 --> 09:12.146
Not as long as there's still a chance.

09:12.179 --> 09:14.916
Vince! Vince!

09:18.385 --> 09:21.088
There's a gas station up the road.

09:21.122 --> 09:22.990
How do you know that?

09:23.024 --> 09:25.359
The map told me.

09:25.392 --> 09:28.095
Maybe they have some gas left. We can push this thing.

09:28.129 --> 09:30.197
Get behind the wheel.

09:33.467 --> 09:35.202
Hey, hey.

09:37.839 --> 09:39.340
We're gonna find them, Steve.

09:44.311 --> 09:46.347
All right, let's go.

09:49.416 --> 09:50.785
Are you pushing?

09:50.818 --> 09:52.319
Yeah.

09:52.353 --> 09:56.423
It'd just be better if it was on a downhill slope.

09:56.457 --> 09:58.059
Go!

10:19.313 --> 10:20.915
Can we stop for a second?

10:20.948 --> 10:23.517
For what? I'm so tired.

10:23.550 --> 10:25.920
I know. We all are. But we don't have any other choice.

10:25.953 --> 10:27.922
We got to keep moving, or we'll never get there.

10:27.955 --> 10:29.857
We're never gonna get there because you took us

10:29.891 --> 10:33.094
Off of a main road because of your internal male compass.

10:33.127 --> 10:36.864
We are heading west, which is where we need to be going.

10:36.898 --> 10:39.466
That is not a compass thing. That's a fact.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.869
All right. Can we just chill out, please?

10:46.874 --> 10:48.442
I'm starting to think we made the wrong move.

10:48.475 --> 10:50.477
We know nothing about this place.

10:50.511 --> 10:51.746
We should've stayed where we were,

10:51.779 --> 10:53.580
Waited for help to come to us.

10:53.614 --> 10:56.083
And end up like Craig? Or worse?

10:58.285 --> 10:59.721
Nobody came.

10:59.754 --> 11:01.555
Our only options are to stay out

11:01.588 --> 11:03.090
In the middle of nowhere and die,

11:03.124 --> 11:05.860
Or we make some attempt to get ourselves to safety.

11:07.494 --> 11:10.097
Allie... Allie, don't do that.

11:10.131 --> 11:11.598
Sorry.

11:11.632 --> 11:13.735
Allie, you can't keep drinking all the water.

11:13.768 --> 11:16.938
I'm thirsty. I'm so thirsty.

11:16.971 --> 11:19.073
We all are, but we need to try and conserve it.

11:19.106 --> 11:21.642
Look.

11:21.675 --> 11:24.746
Looks like a nuclear cloud.

11:24.779 --> 11:27.148
You think that's what happened?

11:27.181 --> 11:31.485
Nuclear war? Somebody tried to bomb us?

11:31.518 --> 11:32.820
I wouldn't rule it out.

11:35.790 --> 11:37.324
Let's just keep moving.

11:52.039 --> 11:55.342
Another BS meeting with no answers.

11:55.376 --> 11:57.711
I can't believe they're keeping us here. We're like prisoners.

11:57.745 --> 12:00.647
I'm sure it's for our own good.

12:00.681 --> 12:03.918
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Philip Keeley

12:03.951 --> 12:05.887
And I've been placed in charge of all northwest sector

12:05.920 --> 12:07.822
Natural resource operations.

12:07.855 --> 12:10.391
What's happening? No one's telling us anything.

12:12.726 --> 12:14.228
Let me be clear.

12:15.662 --> 12:19.533
Two weeks ago, the Earth was like this.

12:19.566 --> 12:22.736
Now it's like this.

12:24.138 --> 12:25.306
Is that clear?

12:25.339 --> 12:29.210
A rogue planet traveling at 300,000 miles an hour

12:29.243 --> 12:31.545
Had a near miss with planet Earth.

12:31.578 --> 12:34.348
The rogue planet's size, speed, and mass

12:34.381 --> 12:38.452
Acted like a huge intergalactic magnet,

12:38.485 --> 12:40.054
Flipping the Earth,

12:40.087 --> 12:44.025
Knocking us out of orbit, and is pulling us in its wake.

12:44.058 --> 12:47.694
I repeat... Pulling us in its wake.

12:47.728 --> 12:52.666
Now, I'm gonna give you all a few moments to think about that,

12:52.699 --> 12:56.237
Cause Lord knows I needed a few myself.

12:56.270 --> 12:59.440
So the universe has just served us up

12:59.473 --> 13:02.176
An enormous crap sandwich

13:02.209 --> 13:05.212
And we're all still trying to choke it down.

13:05.246 --> 13:08.115
Half of the Earth is stuck facing the sun.

13:08.149 --> 13:10.717
The other half is in total darkness.

13:10.751 --> 13:14.922
That's what's been causing all these storms that we've been seeing.

13:14.956 --> 13:18.292
The future is a complete unknown,

13:18.325 --> 13:20.061
But trust me,

13:20.094 --> 13:23.497
You will all be briefed as soon as I am.

13:23.530 --> 13:26.767
They said they would give us updates on our families.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.669
We have loved ones out there.

13:28.702 --> 13:30.504
Yes, and we are still working on it.

13:30.537 --> 13:33.074
Databases are being compiled, records are being sorted through,

13:33.107 --> 13:37.344
But the casualties are in the millions.

13:37.378 --> 13:39.146
When can we go home?

13:39.180 --> 13:42.583
Los Angeles has suffered tremendous damage.

13:42.616 --> 13:44.018
Both coasts have.

13:44.051 --> 13:48.022
Listen, we all need to get used to this fact...

13:48.055 --> 13:50.858
Normal life on this planet

13:50.892 --> 13:53.895
Ended two weeks ago.

13:53.928 --> 13:56.497
Consequently, everything on this continent,

13:56.530 --> 13:59.766
Every natural resource, every gallon of oil,

13:59.800 --> 14:03.337
Every ounce of gold, every fossil fuel

14:03.370 --> 14:05.572
Is our nation's blood,

14:05.606 --> 14:09.176
And our future depends on it.

14:09.210 --> 14:13.847
And that means our future depends on you.

14:13.881 --> 14:17.051
We all carry a burden here.

14:18.752 --> 14:22.356
Let's just carry it together.

14:25.759 --> 14:28.829
I'm sorry, but I have a husband and a child out there

14:28.862 --> 14:30.797
And I'm not just gonna sit idly by.

14:30.831 --> 14:34.268
I understand, but, ma'am, right now you don't have a choice.

14:37.504 --> 14:39.840
Mason. Sir?

14:39.873 --> 14:41.208
Let her go.

14:41.242 --> 14:43.945
You can all be frustrated.

14:43.978 --> 14:46.613
You can yell and scream help. [chuckles]

14:46.647 --> 14:48.983
I'll even let you punch me.

14:49.016 --> 14:52.586
But right now I am helpless

14:52.619 --> 14:55.056
To make this nightmare go away.

15:05.866 --> 15:07.168
Go, go, go!

15:08.769 --> 15:11.939
Go, Vince go!

15:11.973 --> 15:13.307
Harder! I got it!

15:14.775 --> 15:16.110
A little further!

15:16.143 --> 15:18.612
All right, all right, all right! Hold it.

15:23.650 --> 15:25.286
Hello! Hello.

15:28.489 --> 15:30.724
Pumps are off.

15:30.757 --> 15:32.659
What? The pumps are off.

15:32.693 --> 15:36.998
Hey, listen, I worked at a gas station in high school.

15:37.031 --> 15:40.201
You pump. All right.

15:47.408 --> 15:48.575
Anything?

15:48.609 --> 15:51.212
Nah! I got nothing!

15:55.582 --> 15:56.683
Try number three!

15:58.485 --> 16:01.655
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! Good! Yeah!

16:04.425 --> 16:05.626
Yes!

16:11.965 --> 16:13.600
Still no phone signal.

16:14.935 --> 16:16.703
Does that surprise you?

16:16.737 --> 16:18.039
No.

16:29.550 --> 16:31.185
Speak Chinese?

16:31.218 --> 16:34.455
No. I don't speak Chinese.

16:39.893 --> 16:43.730
Uh, Steven?

16:43.764 --> 16:45.066
What?

16:46.700 --> 16:48.202
It's coming right at us.

16:48.235 --> 16:50.104
Let's get out of here. Let's move, come on!

16:51.838 --> 16:53.907
Move, we got to go.

16:53.940 --> 16:55.376
Let's move!

16:58.812 --> 17:00.147
All right, hit it!

17:04.385 --> 17:06.353
Oh, my God, look at this thing.

17:10.124 --> 17:12.025
We got to get out of here.

17:19.366 --> 17:20.233
Hang on.

17:27.540 --> 17:30.677
You got to step on it, will you?! I am!

17:43.624 --> 17:45.492
Damn it.

17:59.573 --> 18:01.575
I just can't believe this is really happening.

18:01.608 --> 18:02.809
Well, it's happening.

18:05.045 --> 18:06.680
They locked me out of my files.

18:06.713 --> 18:10.451
Why is this even important? It's my work.

18:13.420 --> 18:16.223
They've renamed them Operation SAFE.

18:16.257 --> 18:19.160
Operation SAFE. Why would they rename my files?

18:19.193 --> 18:21.895
Look, none of this really matters anymore.

18:21.928 --> 18:23.830
I'm so tired of people telling me

18:23.864 --> 18:26.400
What's important and what isn't.

18:26.433 --> 18:28.335
All right, I'm sorry. I just...

18:29.703 --> 18:31.605
What are you doing?

18:31.638 --> 18:33.174
I'm leaving.

18:33.207 --> 18:34.741
You really think they're gonna let you leave?

18:34.775 --> 18:37.344
Well, they can try to stop me. They have guns.

18:37.378 --> 18:38.879
I don't think they're playing around.

18:38.912 --> 18:40.481
I'm not playing around either.

18:40.514 --> 18:42.149
Well, how far do you think you're gonna get?

18:42.183 --> 18:43.684
They've closed all the roads.

18:43.717 --> 18:47.087
The two most important people in my life are out there lost.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.722
Do you get that?

18:48.755 --> 18:51.925
I'm not gonna just sit around and do nothing.

18:51.958 --> 18:53.460
Do you know what's going on out there?

18:53.494 --> 18:55.562
Los Angeles is gone, Nancy.

18:55.596 --> 18:57.931
My daughter wasn't in Los Angeles.

18:57.964 --> 19:00.066
What if one of those storms whips up?

19:00.100 --> 19:01.435
I'm not gonna just sit around and do nothing.

19:01.468 --> 19:04.338
You understand that, don't you?

19:04.371 --> 19:06.940
Fine, then I'm coming with you.

19:06.973 --> 19:08.409
No, you are not. Yes, I am.

19:08.442 --> 19:10.444
You are not. Absolutely not. Yes, I am.

19:10.477 --> 19:12.579
You are not going out there alone.

19:12.613 --> 19:15.416
I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I let that happen.

19:15.449 --> 19:16.817
I'm serious.

19:19.052 --> 19:20.821
You just tell me how you're planning on getting out of here

19:20.854 --> 19:23.257
Because they really don't want us to leave.

19:24.991 --> 19:26.693
Did I mention they have guns?

19:31.932 --> 19:33.367
You all right, Vince? You okay?

19:33.400 --> 19:35.302
Yeah.

19:35.336 --> 19:37.838
I think I cracked a rib.

19:39.673 --> 19:42.643
You're lucky if that's all you got, man.

19:42.676 --> 19:44.778
No kidding.

19:44.811 --> 19:46.513
Hey, you're bleeding.

19:49.115 --> 19:50.584
I'm fine.

19:52.819 --> 19:56.223
Well, whatever happened to our little planet, it's getting worse.

19:56.257 --> 19:58.925
You got that right.

19:58.959 --> 20:01.495
Well, you don't think this is a nuclear exchange, do you?

20:03.230 --> 20:05.131
Nuclear, Vince?

20:05.165 --> 20:06.967
Yeah. Nuclear?

20:09.703 --> 20:14.040
You know, I once read a book about the Earth flipping on its side.

20:14.074 --> 20:16.710
There's some people who still believe

20:16.743 --> 20:19.946
That that's what killed off the dinosaurs, not a meteorite.

20:21.482 --> 20:23.650
I never heard that. Yeah, well.

20:23.684 --> 20:27.053
You think that's what really happened? You're far out, man, way out.

20:27.087 --> 20:29.923
But it was something big, huh? You know, something global.

20:29.956 --> 20:32.493
Something catastrophic.

20:32.526 --> 20:34.761
This planet, along with all the people

20:34.795 --> 20:36.763
That are still left on it, have just entered a new age.

20:36.797 --> 20:40.634
Look, all I know is our only means of transportation is gone!

20:47.874 --> 20:49.443
What's that?

20:49.476 --> 20:52.346
It's a flyer for that music festival thing.

20:55.849 --> 20:58.319
Yeah, this is that farm

20:58.352 --> 20:59.886
Or the field, wherever the hell they were gonna be.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.755
It's gonna be someplace close to this, Vince.

21:01.788 --> 21:03.957
Whatever happened to stadiums and amphitheaters?

21:03.990 --> 21:06.827
That was the place to be. Guess you're just not cool enough, Vince.

21:06.860 --> 21:11.865
You know, I remember we played this 92,000 big old rock fest.

21:11.898 --> 21:14.535
We're rocking out. We were... we were so...

21:14.568 --> 21:17.371
Vince, Vince. Really?

21:18.705 --> 21:19.740
Let's go.

21:22.476 --> 21:23.777
Wait, wait, wait.

21:26.212 --> 21:27.614
My whole life's in my van.

21:30.216 --> 21:32.486
It's not like anyone's gonna take it.

21:34.287 --> 21:35.756
All right.

21:37.591 --> 21:39.860
Hold on, was that an insult?

21:39.893 --> 21:42.095
Matt, we should have never left that road.

21:42.128 --> 21:44.498
Rachel, just calm down. Calm down?

21:44.531 --> 21:46.299
There is no cover out here.

21:46.333 --> 21:48.034
If there's another storm, we're sitting ducks.

21:48.068 --> 21:51.505
We shouldn't have done this. Do you want to turn back?

21:51.538 --> 21:53.340
Guys... We have no other options.

21:53.374 --> 21:55.776
I need another break. We should have gone home.

21:55.809 --> 21:57.678
And what if there's no home to go back to?

21:57.711 --> 22:00.547
You heard the same thing back at the hotel as I did.

22:00.581 --> 22:03.517
LA is practically gone. You don't know that for sure.

22:03.550 --> 22:05.318
Rach... You're right, I don't.

22:05.352 --> 22:07.053
We don't know anything at this point.

22:07.087 --> 22:09.690
We can only hope that the intel we got is correct,

22:09.723 --> 22:12.793
That Safe Haven is a safe zone.

22:12.826 --> 22:15.596
Oh, you mean for rich people or government officials?

22:15.629 --> 22:17.263
I need some more water.

22:17.297 --> 22:18.732
What if they don't even let us in?

22:18.765 --> 22:21.334
We are American citizens. I just...

22:22.669 --> 22:24.104
Guys, that's all the water we had!

22:24.137 --> 22:25.606
Allie did it.

22:27.808 --> 22:29.476
Allie. Allie?

22:29.510 --> 22:30.844
Allie, oh, my God. Allie, are you okay?

22:32.613 --> 22:35.115
She's dehydrated. You think?

22:38.452 --> 22:42.589
Matt, look. Maybe they have water or something.

22:42.623 --> 22:43.624
Wait.

22:45.058 --> 22:47.694
Come on.

22:47.728 --> 22:49.430
Come on. You think they're dangerous?

22:49.463 --> 22:50.831
I don't think we should trust anyone right now,

22:50.864 --> 22:52.298
Especially not people with guns.

22:52.332 --> 22:54.334
Guns? Come on.

22:54.367 --> 22:56.102
Oh, God, I hope they didn't hear me.

23:01.174 --> 23:04.478
Hey, Vince, this is it.

23:04.511 --> 23:05.912
This is the place. Yeah.

23:08.849 --> 23:11.685
You know, it was a long shot, Steve.

23:11.718 --> 23:14.621
I know. I know, I was just hoping.

23:14.655 --> 23:16.823
Maybe it's better that no one's here.

23:16.857 --> 23:18.925
Where'd they go?

23:18.959 --> 23:20.694
Maybe they went home.

23:20.727 --> 23:23.329
Vince, come on. I'm just saying.

23:23.363 --> 23:26.933
Maybe if they lived in Denver or the Midwest,

23:26.967 --> 23:30.370
But I'm sure the word spread about what happened at the coast.

23:30.403 --> 23:33.474
They're just kids. They don't know nothing.

23:37.878 --> 23:39.580
It's coming this way.

23:42.182 --> 23:44.417
No, I think now it's moving away.

23:45.418 --> 23:47.153
Until the next one.

23:50.256 --> 23:52.158
What is that?

23:54.528 --> 23:56.129
"Safe Haven."

23:56.162 --> 24:00.133
Sounds great. Sign me up. Is it a phone number?

24:00.166 --> 24:03.336
No, it's a sequence like the ones at the gas station.

24:03.369 --> 24:06.740
What one at the gas station?

24:06.773 --> 24:08.909
Never mind. It's a phone number.

24:08.942 --> 24:13.446
This is a radio station, lotto super jackpot.

24:16.517 --> 24:18.885
Safe Haven.

24:18.919 --> 24:20.220
That's...

24:20.253 --> 24:23.790
This means something. These numbers mean something.

24:23.824 --> 24:26.760
You think this is a coded message? I don't know, maybe.

24:26.793 --> 24:28.895
I got an uncoded message for you.

24:28.929 --> 24:32.198
There's nobody here but us and there's no way out of here.

24:36.436 --> 24:37.738
Hey.

24:40.607 --> 24:43.076
Maybe there's something at that farm we can borrow.

24:43.109 --> 24:46.547
You mean like a horse?

24:46.580 --> 24:48.114
Beats walking.

24:50.050 --> 24:52.485
I hate horses.

24:52.519 --> 24:54.655
I don't care.

24:54.688 --> 24:57.490
I got kicked in the head once.

25:00.260 --> 25:01.494
Move! Move! [siren wailing]

25:01.528 --> 25:03.029
So much for your plan.

25:03.063 --> 25:04.831
Yeah, I'm not ready to scrap it yet.

25:07.868 --> 25:10.270
Go left. Come on. Come on.

25:27.353 --> 25:29.155
You think this is a good idea?

25:29.189 --> 25:31.457
Well, if you don't want to come, you can turn back around.

25:31.491 --> 25:33.226
But this is my chance to make a break for it.

25:33.259 --> 25:35.629
I think this is your chance to get yourself killed.

25:35.662 --> 25:38.531
I'm aware of that. Okay.

25:43.303 --> 25:44.605
Get in.

26:07.828 --> 26:10.931
Hey! Is there anyone out here?

26:15.568 --> 26:16.937
Shh.

26:20.173 --> 26:21.642
I think they're gone.

26:25.946 --> 26:28.581
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

26:28.615 --> 26:30.016
I ain't gonna hurt you.

26:30.050 --> 26:32.886
Here, look.

26:32.919 --> 26:35.255
It's for protection, that's all.

26:35.288 --> 26:38.959
Looks like you all need a drink.

26:38.992 --> 26:40.493
Allie.

26:40.526 --> 26:42.262
No, go on ahead. We have enough to share.

26:42.295 --> 26:44.865
Easy, easy.

26:44.898 --> 26:47.768
So, um...

26:47.801 --> 26:49.703
Do you guys know what's going on?

26:49.736 --> 26:51.537
What's happening?

26:51.571 --> 26:54.941
Damn apocalypse, that's what's going on.

26:54.975 --> 26:58.044
Fire and brimstone, the whole nine yards.

26:58.078 --> 27:00.480
It's fun, ain't it?

27:00.513 --> 27:02.115
Where you guys headed?

27:04.584 --> 27:06.887
Who says we're headed anywhere?

27:08.889 --> 27:10.924
Well, I know you aren't setting up camp out here.

27:17.330 --> 27:18.732
Safe Haven?

27:18.765 --> 27:20.433
That's right.

27:20.466 --> 27:22.368
Where'd you get that?

27:22.402 --> 27:25.672
A bunch of people at a concert we were stranded at.

27:25.706 --> 27:27.207
Apparently some computer hackers

27:27.240 --> 27:29.542
Gained access to some top-secret information.

27:29.575 --> 27:31.377
They were spreading the word.

27:31.411 --> 27:34.114
Well, looks like we're all moving on the same information.

27:34.147 --> 27:36.316
You know about it?

27:36.349 --> 27:39.619
That's right. Government thinks they're gonna decide who lives or dies.

27:39.652 --> 27:41.888
Not on our watch.

27:41.922 --> 27:44.257
Safety in numbers. We'll go together.

27:44.290 --> 27:47.894
Besides, y'all don't look like you're doing so good by yourselves.

27:47.928 --> 27:50.463
Let's go. Come on.

27:50.496 --> 27:52.032
Yeah, come on.

28:06.279 --> 28:09.950
This is the Earth moving through space and fast.

28:09.983 --> 28:12.753
As you know, we have literally been pulled out of orbit.

28:12.786 --> 28:14.821
We believe that even at a greater distance,

28:14.855 --> 28:17.223
The Earth can sustain life.

28:17.257 --> 28:19.492
It is believed that this area, as we have highlighted,

28:19.525 --> 28:22.162
Is the livable zone.

28:22.195 --> 28:23.830
Anything outside this,

28:23.864 --> 28:27.801
And our planet will be too cold to sustain human life.

28:27.834 --> 28:30.336
As of right now, we are gathering information

28:30.370 --> 28:33.706
As to how long the Earth will continue its progression.

28:33.740 --> 28:35.909
We are holding out hope

28:35.942 --> 28:40.146
That the sun's gravity will negate this pull effect

28:40.180 --> 28:42.348
At some point and hold us within the livable zone.

28:42.382 --> 28:44.317
But right now we have a much more pressing issue.

28:44.350 --> 28:47.653
We are closing in on the asteroid belt.

28:47.687 --> 28:50.390
The chances that the Earth will sustain

28:50.423 --> 28:52.492
An extinction-inducing blow

28:52.525 --> 28:55.195
Are hovering at about 85%.

28:55.228 --> 28:59.465
This is why we have enacted Operation SAFE.

29:14.614 --> 29:15.916
God.

29:17.283 --> 29:18.985
Oh, man.

29:21.254 --> 29:22.522
Hello!

29:26.492 --> 29:27.861
Hello! Is anybody home?

29:27.894 --> 29:30.096
I don't think anybody's home, Steve.

29:30.130 --> 29:32.098
What gave you that idea, Vince?

29:32.132 --> 29:34.367
I don't think the keys are in it.

29:36.602 --> 29:38.438
You're all heart, man.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.542
What do you want me to do?

29:42.575 --> 29:44.110
I can't do anything about that.

29:44.144 --> 29:45.678
Do you want to find your family or not?

29:45.711 --> 29:47.447
Maybe we should just knock on the door first.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.182
That's what I was... Oh, yeah, let's knock on the door

29:49.215 --> 29:50.851
Of a farm in the middle of the apocalypse.

29:50.884 --> 29:53.854
Hello? Hey, help us, please!

29:53.887 --> 29:57.023
Our car hit your cow and we need transpo!

29:58.458 --> 29:59.993
No one's home.

30:00.026 --> 30:01.995
They took off like everyone else with half a brain.

30:03.329 --> 30:06.099
Hey, let's hotwire this thing and get out of here.

30:08.869 --> 30:10.904
Ah, here it is.

30:17.978 --> 30:19.679
Can you please stop?

30:19.712 --> 30:21.714
Just it's giving me a headache.

30:21.747 --> 30:24.750
I'm just trying to find something, anything.

30:24.784 --> 30:26.619
Besides, you're not saying much.

30:26.652 --> 30:28.889
I'm thinking. I'm just thinking.

30:28.922 --> 30:31.291
I think if I close my eyes and open them,

30:31.324 --> 30:34.227
Then everything will be back to normal, but that's not gonna happen, is it?

30:37.730 --> 30:40.800
Where are we headed anyway? Long Hills.

30:40.833 --> 30:43.436
There's some music festival, some concert that my daughter was at.

30:43.469 --> 30:46.539
Last I spoke to her anyway. That's pretty far.

30:46.572 --> 30:48.308
I'm not sure we're gonna have enough gas to get there.

30:48.341 --> 30:50.443
Well, we're gonna have to stop.

30:50.476 --> 30:53.113
Considering everything that's been said over the past two weeks,

30:53.146 --> 30:54.780
I don't think that's a viable option.

30:54.814 --> 30:57.650
We'll know soon enough, right?

30:57.683 --> 30:59.719
Why are you here?

30:59.752 --> 31:04.124
Don't give me that BS about "I couldn't live with myself."

31:04.157 --> 31:06.359
It's not BS. I don't have a family.

31:08.428 --> 31:09.629
You're my family.

31:19.039 --> 31:21.174
Wish there was some coffee around here.

31:28.448 --> 31:31.084
Ow. Ow!

31:33.987 --> 31:35.455
Have you done this before, Vince?

31:35.488 --> 31:37.557
Yeah, a few times.

31:37.590 --> 31:39.025
How few?

31:40.560 --> 31:43.129
Can I get some quiet? I'm trying to focus.

31:43.163 --> 31:44.730
Sorry.

31:44.764 --> 31:47.934
I didn't realize you were such a... isn't it just two wires?

31:49.970 --> 31:52.072
What in God's name you think you're doing?!

31:52.105 --> 31:53.873
Get the hell out of my truck!

31:53.906 --> 31:56.709
"Don't knock. There's nobody home."

31:56.742 --> 31:58.979
Shut it, both of you!

31:59.012 --> 32:01.081
That's my truck.

32:01.114 --> 32:02.615
We're on a mission, man.

32:02.648 --> 32:04.217
Yeah, for what?

32:04.250 --> 32:06.352
Rip off an old man? No.

32:06.386 --> 32:07.920
Like the last group come through here,

32:07.954 --> 32:09.956
Took everything wasn't nailed down?!

32:09.990 --> 32:11.291
Sorry to hear about that, sir.

32:11.324 --> 32:13.859
You two don't appear much better.

32:13.893 --> 32:16.096
We didn't think anybody was here

32:16.129 --> 32:18.664
And we're just looking for my daughter.

32:18.698 --> 32:21.567
Did you, uh... did know that person over there?

32:21.601 --> 32:24.104
That was my wife.

32:24.137 --> 32:26.139
I'm sorry, sir. We're very sorry.

32:26.172 --> 32:30.210
She got caught out in one of them storms.

32:30.243 --> 32:32.145
I just, uh...

32:34.314 --> 32:37.217
Just too afraid to move her, I guess.

32:38.985 --> 32:41.021
I haven't spoken to my daughter in two weeks.

32:42.655 --> 32:46.426
I know she's somewhere in the area, maybe alone, maybe scared.

32:46.459 --> 32:49.129
Maybe dead.

32:49.162 --> 32:50.630
Yeah, I thought about that.

32:52.432 --> 32:55.801
The last storm took our van, nearly killed both of us.

32:57.703 --> 33:00.373
What the...

33:00.406 --> 33:01.541
Steve?

33:03.143 --> 33:05.478
Sir, intel's confirmed inbound meteors.

33:05.511 --> 33:08.181
How many are we talking? They didn't specify.

33:08.214 --> 33:10.516
Get everyone back down to the shelters on the double.

33:10.550 --> 33:11.651
Yes, sir.

33:11.684 --> 33:14.354
Damn it! Here we go again.

33:23.896 --> 33:25.931
Move!

33:25.965 --> 33:27.467
Come on!

33:32.872 --> 33:34.674
Oh, God.

33:39.079 --> 33:40.580
Come on! Go!

33:40.613 --> 33:42.648
Get out! Run!

33:49.722 --> 33:52.325
Go! Run!

34:08.408 --> 34:10.676
Follow me. Follow you? Where are we going?

34:10.710 --> 34:12.578
This way. Let's go!

34:12.612 --> 34:14.179
I got a bomb shelter.

34:28.393 --> 34:29.728
Get down!!

34:35.034 --> 34:36.702
Come on.

34:50.315 --> 34:52.685
Matt!!

34:58.524 --> 35:00.560
My great-grandfather built it.

35:00.593 --> 35:05.265
I made some modifications. She'll hold up to a lot.

35:05.298 --> 35:08.301
Not a direct hit from a global killer, though.

35:08.334 --> 35:10.370
These meteors are small potatoes.

35:10.403 --> 35:13.139
We get hit by a big one, boys, and its game over.

35:14.574 --> 35:16.709
What makes you say there's gonna be more?

35:16.742 --> 35:20.446
Well, just guessing the further we move out...

35:20.480 --> 35:23.916
Wait, the further who moves out?

35:23.949 --> 35:25.951
Us, the planet.

35:25.985 --> 35:27.987
Say what?

35:28.020 --> 35:30.656
You two don't know, do you?

35:30.690 --> 35:33.393
I thought everybody pretty much knew by now.

35:33.426 --> 35:36.629
No, we've been... We've been guessing.

35:36.662 --> 35:39.299
We've been on the road since we evacuated LA.

35:39.332 --> 35:42.202
And the radios and the phones are useless.

35:42.235 --> 35:45.805
Well, what do you think is going on?

35:45.838 --> 35:47.773
I don't know.

35:49.742 --> 35:51.344
You two better sit down.

36:06.058 --> 36:08.994
You okay? Yeah, you?

36:09.028 --> 36:10.663
Oh, my God.

36:10.696 --> 36:13.666
Yeah.

36:13.699 --> 36:16.469
I think that went past.

36:16.502 --> 36:17.703
Yeah.

36:17.737 --> 36:20.540
Who knows how long until the next catastrophe?

36:20.573 --> 36:23.843
Sooner rather than later, I think.

36:23.876 --> 36:27.046
Let's get out of here. All right?

36:27.079 --> 36:28.681
Yeah, let's go.

36:39.992 --> 36:43.229
Think it's gonna be okay? It better.

36:49.569 --> 36:52.238
I think we should hole up here for a bit,

36:52.272 --> 36:55.040
Least till we find out if this thing's over.

36:55.074 --> 36:57.310
What makes you think it's gonna be over?

36:57.343 --> 37:00.112
I can't believe it. I just can't.

37:00.145 --> 37:03.015
I know. Shh. It's okay. We're gonna be okay.

37:03.048 --> 37:04.350
Just stay positive and strong.

37:04.384 --> 37:08.488
But Matt, he was right there!

37:08.521 --> 37:10.323
I know.

37:13.659 --> 37:15.528
I'm really sorry about your friend.

37:15.561 --> 37:17.263
Could have been any one of us.

37:19.532 --> 37:24.236
Thousands of people have died, probably millions by now.

37:25.237 --> 37:27.006
It sucks.

37:27.039 --> 37:29.475
It's the truth and it sucks.

37:29.509 --> 37:31.477
And we all have to deal with that.

37:31.511 --> 37:34.447
I just want to go home.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.916
Hey, there is no home.

37:36.949 --> 37:39.352
Home doesn't exist.

37:39.385 --> 37:44.457
But our fair government, they found a safe place.

37:44.490 --> 37:48.594
The president and his staff and all the wealthy well-to-dos,

37:48.628 --> 37:50.363
They're gonna get together and they're gonna go there

37:50.396 --> 37:52.197
And they're gonna figure this out.

37:54.734 --> 37:59.171
And when we can, we're gonna go there, too.

37:59.204 --> 38:02.475
Then what are we still doing here?

38:02.508 --> 38:04.477
Let's go! Let's just go now.

38:04.510 --> 38:07.112
Because we all want to get there, right?

38:07.146 --> 38:09.549
And not end up like your friend.

38:11.717 --> 38:12.885
Or my family.

38:14.720 --> 38:17.490
God rest their souls. Amen.

38:20.125 --> 38:21.627
I'm sorry.

38:23.963 --> 38:25.998
Don't worry about it.

38:26.031 --> 38:27.367
It is what it is.

38:30.302 --> 38:32.772
So this, uh, place,

38:32.805 --> 38:36.942
Do you think we're just gonna be able to walk in?

38:36.976 --> 38:41.814
I mean, they're placing all these important people there, so...

38:43.616 --> 38:45.485
No, we don't suppose they're gonna roll out

38:45.518 --> 38:48.220
Any red carpet for us, if that's what you're asking.

38:48.253 --> 38:49.655
No, they ain't.

38:59.965 --> 39:01.567
Building's been compromised!

39:01.601 --> 39:02.968
We've been ordered to evac

39:03.002 --> 39:05.571
To a mobile military command just outside the zone.

39:05.605 --> 39:07.473
What's your clock at?

39:07.507 --> 39:09.241
SOLDIER: T-minus 23 hours and counting, sir.

39:10.943 --> 39:14.046
We got to get out of here before we're all buried alive!

39:14.079 --> 39:15.347
Yes, sir.

39:15.381 --> 39:17.483
Come on, move. On the double! Move!

39:17.517 --> 39:20.386
Let's move! Move!

39:20.420 --> 39:22.688
How do you know all this?

39:22.722 --> 39:25.958
Told you, some of the stations were still reporting the info

39:25.991 --> 39:28.193
As it was coming in.

39:28.227 --> 39:32.164
Well, until it went dark, anyway.

39:32.197 --> 39:35.468
Holy mother of all things. Yeah.

39:35.501 --> 39:39.905
Holy... I thought it was bad, but this is...

39:39.939 --> 39:41.907
I couldn't have written it worse than this.

39:43.843 --> 39:46.846
That's where the storms are coming from.

39:46.879 --> 39:49.682
Earth's moving faster now, right?

39:49.715 --> 39:52.985
You got the jet stream knocked out of whack.

39:53.018 --> 39:55.588
You got half the planet baking in the sun

39:55.621 --> 39:58.123
And the other half freezing facing away.

39:58.157 --> 40:00.593
That's what's causing these superheated storms.

40:00.626 --> 40:04.830
And these super-frozen storms are moving at hurricane speed.

40:04.864 --> 40:07.399
It's just beating the hell out of the planet

40:07.433 --> 40:09.902
And it's not even our biggest problem, right?

40:09.935 --> 40:11.403
No.

40:11.437 --> 40:13.238
And the two of you are out in the middle of it all

40:13.272 --> 40:15.641
Doing God knows what.

40:15.675 --> 40:19.078
I told you. I'm looking for my daughter.

40:19.111 --> 40:21.213
Right, daughter.

40:21.246 --> 40:23.048
Right.

40:23.082 --> 40:26.586
Yeah, and you're thinking you're just gonna find her, like, what?

40:26.619 --> 40:28.754
Like... like magic?

40:28.788 --> 40:30.490
No, we're following her trail.

40:30.523 --> 40:33.358
She was here at that concert down on the farm.

40:33.392 --> 40:35.895
Yeah, those sons of B's.

40:35.928 --> 40:40.666
They got some nerve pulling a stunt like that out of here,

40:40.700 --> 40:43.636
Ripping up the land, scaring the cattle.

40:43.669 --> 40:46.338
Well, I guess it...

40:46.371 --> 40:48.140
Don't matter much now.

40:48.173 --> 40:49.509
Do you know where they went?

40:49.542 --> 40:52.612
No, can't say that I do.

40:52.645 --> 40:55.915
I could hear a lot of commotion up there for a while though,

40:55.948 --> 40:59.752
And then it sounded like military trucks and helicopters came in.

40:59.785 --> 41:02.354
I think they rounded them up.

41:02.387 --> 41:05.390
Well, I can't rightly say.

41:05.424 --> 41:06.959
Show him the flyer.

41:06.992 --> 41:10.796
Oh. What? What's that?

41:10.830 --> 41:13.065
We've been seeing a series of numbers spray-painted

41:13.098 --> 41:15.935
All over the place, storefronts, billboards.

41:15.968 --> 41:18.337
And then we found this at the concert site.

41:18.370 --> 41:21.941
Safe Haven? Yeah, I know it's a long shot,

41:21.974 --> 41:24.009
But we think maybe that's a clue as to where they've gone.

41:24.043 --> 41:26.145
Can you make anything out of those numbers?

41:26.178 --> 41:28.447
Yeah, it's coordinates.

41:28.480 --> 41:29.815
Of course.

41:29.849 --> 41:31.617
Are you sure? How do you know that?

41:31.651 --> 41:34.920
I take it neither of you two was ever in the military.

41:34.954 --> 41:36.488
Yeah. No.

41:41.594 --> 41:44.964
See, what you got here is two sets of numbers.

41:44.997 --> 41:50.335
You got 45.05 degrees north latitude

41:50.369 --> 41:55.675
And negative 104.2 degrees longitude.

41:55.708 --> 41:58.143
That would put it somewhere around here.

42:00.312 --> 42:02.114
So you mean it's close?

42:02.147 --> 42:05.250
Yeah, it ain't on the other side of the world, that's for sure.

42:05.284 --> 42:06.619
Yeah, I'd say it's close.

42:06.652 --> 42:09.388
Sir, I need to do this.

42:09.421 --> 42:14.226
I need to find my daughter and my wife, please.

42:14.259 --> 42:17.229
I'll give you the truck.

42:19.464 --> 42:21.767
And I'm guessing you'll need provisions.

42:24.837 --> 42:26.872
But, uh...

42:26.906 --> 42:30.442
I need you to help me with something first.

42:30.475 --> 42:33.312
Anything, anything, just name it.

42:34.580 --> 42:36.649
Yeah, anything.

42:50.663 --> 42:53.532
You okay? Mm-hmm.

42:53.565 --> 42:56.001
We're gonna make it. We're gonna find Rachel.

42:58.337 --> 43:00.039
I don't know.

43:00.072 --> 43:02.007
We are.

43:02.041 --> 43:05.310
We're in this now. There's no room for doubt, not for a second.

43:07.412 --> 43:09.281
Yeah, right.

43:11.116 --> 43:14.219
Why'd they lock me out of my files?

43:14.253 --> 43:15.655
What?

43:15.688 --> 43:18.557
That bogus find, why'd they take my files,

43:18.590 --> 43:22.094
Rename them, then put a clearance on them?

43:22.127 --> 43:25.397
Nice segue. I don't know.

43:25.430 --> 43:27.132
Maybe they weren't bogus after all.

43:27.166 --> 43:28.801
That much gas? Come on.

43:28.834 --> 43:30.369
Maybe.

43:30.402 --> 43:32.437
Why are you thinking about that now?

43:32.471 --> 43:33.773
Because when I think about work,

43:33.806 --> 43:35.574
I tend to think about nothing else,

43:35.607 --> 43:37.342
And usually it's a bad thing, but right now,

43:37.376 --> 43:40.045
It's... it's a pretty great thing.

43:43.615 --> 43:45.184
It was a nice find.

43:46.686 --> 43:48.688
I hope it matters someday.

44:08.173 --> 44:11.176
Well, I sure want to thank you for that.

44:11.210 --> 44:13.112
Sure thing.

44:14.714 --> 44:18.250
All right, then the truck's yours.

44:18.283 --> 44:19.952
The maps are in the glove box.

44:19.985 --> 44:23.388
There's an extra tank of gas in the bed.

44:25.657 --> 44:27.559
You saved our lives.

44:27.592 --> 44:29.862
You'd have done the same.

44:32.664 --> 44:34.433
Sure hope you find your daughter.

44:36.335 --> 44:37.837
Thank you.

44:44.643 --> 44:46.011
All right, then.

45:00.525 --> 45:01.927
You got the flyer?

45:10.535 --> 45:13.038
We gonna talk about what's going on?

45:13.072 --> 45:16.641
What, about our planet being knocked out of orbit,

45:16.675 --> 45:18.377
Careening aimlessly through the solar system?

45:18.410 --> 45:19.711
Yeah, that.

45:21.013 --> 45:22.447
No.

45:22.481 --> 45:24.183
Okay.

45:40.699 --> 45:42.267
Wait.

45:42.301 --> 45:43.803
What is it?

45:43.836 --> 45:46.806
Oh, my God, is that the motel?

45:46.839 --> 45:49.809
What motel? What are you talking about?

46:03.255 --> 46:06.391
This motel, it was my last call with Rachel.

46:06.425 --> 46:08.293
It was here.

46:13.465 --> 46:15.968
Hello?

46:16.001 --> 46:19.104
Here's the office. The office!

46:23.909 --> 46:25.644
Nobody's here.

46:25.677 --> 46:27.712
Where is everybody?

46:27.746 --> 46:30.449
Oh, nobody's here.

46:30.482 --> 46:33.953
Hello? Hello? It's locked.

46:36.621 --> 46:38.290
Everything is dead. Everything is dead.

46:38.323 --> 46:41.060
Oh, my God, it's like this everywhere!

46:41.093 --> 46:42.594
Hey.

46:42.627 --> 46:44.429
How's my daughter gonna survive?

46:44.463 --> 46:47.266
Hey, hey, hey, calm down. How's my daughter gonna survive?

46:47.299 --> 46:49.601
She's got a good head on her shoulders.

46:49.634 --> 46:52.237
You raised a good kid, that's how.

46:52.271 --> 46:54.039
We're gonna retrace her steps,

46:54.073 --> 46:56.808
And when we find her, she's gonna be alive.

46:56.842 --> 46:58.577
You have to believe that.

47:26.271 --> 47:28.173
Allie?

47:28.207 --> 47:29.774
Allie, hey.

47:29.808 --> 47:31.643
Yeah?

47:31.676 --> 47:35.547
Do these guys make you... uneasy?

47:35.580 --> 47:37.917
They saved our lives.

47:37.950 --> 47:39.919
Yeah, but not Matt's.

47:43.522 --> 47:44.990
What are you saying?

47:47.927 --> 47:49.261
I don't know.

47:50.963 --> 47:53.298
Did you sleep?

47:55.234 --> 47:58.603
That's why. You're overtired, your brain is fried.

48:00.940 --> 48:03.142
They have guns.

48:03.175 --> 48:06.211
If they wanted something, they would have taken it by now.

48:09.848 --> 48:11.450
Yeah, I guess.

48:15.020 --> 48:16.922
Hope you got your rest.

48:16.956 --> 48:19.324
We're moving out.

48:19.358 --> 48:22.227
Is it safe to go?

48:22.261 --> 48:23.395
Not sure.

48:23.428 --> 48:26.598
I haven't heard anything fall from the sky.

48:26.631 --> 48:29.234
No storms in a bit.

48:29.268 --> 48:31.736
We all know they're coming back.

48:31.770 --> 48:33.905
Seems a good time as any.

48:33.939 --> 48:36.508
It feels safe here.

48:36.541 --> 48:39.444
Can't we just stay here and wait for someone to find us?

48:39.478 --> 48:40.845
For help to come?

48:40.879 --> 48:43.848
Uh-uh, we're leaving.

48:43.882 --> 48:45.284
And y'all are coming.

49:22.621 --> 49:26.025
I don't understand it. Let's say it's true.

49:26.058 --> 49:28.860
Let's say there's this one place designated as safe.

49:28.893 --> 49:30.829
Safe how? Why?

49:30.862 --> 49:34.799
It's got to be a place that's somewhere in the middle, right?

49:34.833 --> 49:36.768
Yeah. Moderate temperature.

49:36.801 --> 49:39.338
Equidistant between these two extremes.

49:39.371 --> 49:41.740
And of course, it can't be on a continental plate

49:41.773 --> 49:46.845
Because the seismic activity would just crumble it like the coast.

49:46.878 --> 49:48.780
Yeah, that makes sense.

49:48.813 --> 49:51.883
But what's with the cryptic code?

49:51.916 --> 49:54.119
Why not spread the word, get everyone there?

49:55.487 --> 49:57.856
There's only one reason for that, Vince.

49:57.889 --> 49:59.491
Think about it.

49:59.524 --> 50:03.128
The government doesn't want 300 million people

50:03.162 --> 50:05.930
In a place that can only hold like 10.

50:05.964 --> 50:09.201
I'm sure it's something like that. Oh.

50:09.234 --> 50:13.305
Of course, considering what's been going on,

50:13.338 --> 50:16.541
I highly doubt that there's 300 million of us left, Vince.

50:22.147 --> 50:24.049
Must have been hard for you.

50:24.083 --> 50:25.684
What's that?

50:25.717 --> 50:28.353
You know, burying that guy's wife.

50:28.387 --> 50:31.056
I kept thinking about you and Nancy.

50:31.090 --> 50:33.858
No, no, Nancy's fine. She's alive.

50:33.892 --> 50:37.229
Yeah, she's smart. She's strong.

50:37.262 --> 50:40.165
She's stronger than me.

50:40.199 --> 50:41.800
She's in a government facility,

50:41.833 --> 50:44.869
So I'm sure she's... she's alive.

50:44.903 --> 50:47.772
Yeah, no, I just thought it was hard for you because, you know,

50:47.806 --> 50:49.441
You're a writer.

50:49.474 --> 50:52.977
You just... you do this all day, not used to shoveling.

50:53.011 --> 50:54.346
Yeah?

50:54.379 --> 50:57.749
You know, because to shovel, you need these.

50:57.782 --> 50:59.484
Yeah.

50:59.518 --> 51:02.121
Yeah, get in the truck.

51:19.003 --> 51:20.839
Got something.

51:20.872 --> 51:23.442
That's the music festival.

51:23.475 --> 51:24.909
Right.

51:24.943 --> 51:27.279
It says it's just a few miles east of here.

51:27.312 --> 51:29.148
Yeah, okay, but that was two weeks ago.

51:29.181 --> 51:31.283
I mean, could they still even be there now?

51:31.316 --> 51:34.419
Well, we're gonna find out.

51:34.453 --> 51:37.456
You just said we would retrace our steps and follow our clues.

51:37.489 --> 51:39.558
That's what you said. Yeah, absolutely.

51:39.591 --> 51:41.460
I was just hoping we'd find something here first

51:41.493 --> 51:42.994
And then maybe jump a few steps...

51:43.027 --> 51:44.596
There's nothing here. We have to go.

51:47.699 --> 51:49.334
We got to get out of here.

52:03.582 --> 52:06.251
That doesn't look good.

52:06.285 --> 52:07.586
If we're gonna go, we should go now!

52:07.619 --> 52:09.588
No! Too dangerous. We should wait it out.

52:09.621 --> 52:11.423
Nancy, come on! I don't think you understand how cold this storm is.

52:11.456 --> 52:12.991
I think we can outrun it and keep moving.

52:13.024 --> 52:14.125
No. Let's go.

52:16.228 --> 52:19.264
Go! Come on! Now! Run!

52:24.669 --> 52:25.737
Come on.

52:28.139 --> 52:30.209
Make sure you lock that. Help me.

52:32.644 --> 52:35.079
If the wind blows that window open, we're dead.

52:35.113 --> 52:37.749
Help me with this. Help me, come on!

52:43.855 --> 52:45.424
Yes.

52:49.494 --> 52:51.530
Can we at least slow down for a bit?

52:51.563 --> 52:54.466
No. I don't like when things are quiet.

52:54.499 --> 52:56.468
Things are never quiet for long these days.

52:56.501 --> 53:01.139
We need to make as much ground as we can while we can.

53:01.172 --> 53:03.141
You see what I mean?

53:17.055 --> 53:18.490
Is that headed this way?

53:18.523 --> 53:20.925
Hard to tell. Let's keep moving.

53:25.029 --> 53:26.531
What's that?

53:26.565 --> 53:29.268
Trees! Get in the trees! What? Why?

53:48.119 --> 53:50.755
Do you think it's gone? I don't know.

53:50.789 --> 53:52.357
What was that?

53:52.391 --> 53:55.360
It was a military drone. Don't you watch the news?

53:55.394 --> 53:57.529
Why would they send it here?

53:57.562 --> 53:59.798
Are they trying to track the storms?

53:59.831 --> 54:02.133
Maybe. Or us.

54:02.166 --> 54:03.368
Us?

54:03.402 --> 54:05.169
It means we're getting closer.

54:05.203 --> 54:07.672
Closer to what?

54:07.706 --> 54:09.641
Safe Haven.

54:09.674 --> 54:11.610
Yeah, and I reckon we're not the only unwanted guests

54:11.643 --> 54:13.578
Trying to get there, if you know what I mean.

54:13.612 --> 54:14.513
Let's go.

54:17.181 --> 54:20.084
If it's US military, why are we hiding from them?

54:20.118 --> 54:21.753
Let's go, now!

54:34.766 --> 54:36.935
Okay.

54:36.968 --> 54:38.737
Hold on. Okay.

54:40.972 --> 54:43.475
It's coming. Here it comes.

54:43.508 --> 54:45.009
Hold on.

54:45.043 --> 54:46.578
Okay. Hold on.

54:46.611 --> 54:48.980
Got it. I got it! Hold on.

54:49.013 --> 54:50.449
You got it.

54:52.451 --> 54:54.586
Get ready! Hold on!

55:02.160 --> 55:04.963
No!

55:35.694 --> 55:38.663
What do you think these signs mean?

55:38.697 --> 55:40.465
Very funny.

55:40.499 --> 55:42.934
Yet you're still driving through.

55:42.967 --> 55:45.737
I'm not gonna stop until someone tells me to stop.

55:47.672 --> 55:50.675
Maps says the coordinates are that way.

55:50.709 --> 55:52.043
You know, when I said the government

55:52.076 --> 55:53.311
Doesn't want a lot of people here,

55:53.344 --> 55:56.648
Seems like they don't want anybody here.

55:56.681 --> 55:59.384
Not without permission at least, no.

56:08.560 --> 56:10.862
Did you not see the signs?

56:14.298 --> 56:16.267
Maybe we should ask him for directions.

56:16.300 --> 56:19.337
Let me do the talking.

56:19.370 --> 56:21.139
Did you not see the signs?

56:21.172 --> 56:24.843
I'm sorry. I'm looking for someone.

56:24.876 --> 56:27.479
Well, you're looking in the wrong place. No one's here.

56:27.512 --> 56:28.847
No, no, I understand,

56:28.880 --> 56:30.515
But I think my daughter came here.

56:30.549 --> 56:32.851
Like I said, no one's here.

56:32.884 --> 56:35.386
Now I'm gonna have to ask you to turn this vehicle around.

56:37.088 --> 56:39.924
This is Safe Haven, right?

56:39.958 --> 56:44.663
This is a restricted area and I am losing my patience.

56:45.830 --> 56:48.567
Okay, it's cool.

57:10.889 --> 57:13.558
Sure is a fine mess we've got ourselves into.

57:13.592 --> 57:16.928
You got that right, sir. I heard you barely made it out.

57:16.961 --> 57:18.530
Damn lucky.

57:18.563 --> 57:20.098
Have you been able to establish a perimeter?

57:20.131 --> 57:21.399
We're working on it.

57:21.432 --> 57:23.367
But tell someone they can't be somewhere,

57:23.401 --> 57:25.169
It's the first place they want to go.

57:25.203 --> 57:26.571
We're doing our best.

57:26.605 --> 57:28.540
How about that briefing with the president?

57:28.573 --> 57:32.210
Sir, if you walk this way, we'll get you up to speed.

57:37.816 --> 57:39.884
Sir, the storms are getting worse.

57:39.918 --> 57:41.586
As long as the Earth is spinning on its side like this,

57:41.620 --> 57:42.587
It's just gonna keep happening.

57:42.621 --> 57:44.088
And our position?

57:44.122 --> 57:46.024
Not pretty. Pull that up for us?

57:51.329 --> 57:53.865
We're not slowing down.

57:53.898 --> 57:55.967
Operations SAFE is prepped and ready.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.002
We're just awaiting the president's go-ahead.

58:00.438 --> 58:03.542
National Guard has a perimeter established, which hasn't been easy.

58:03.575 --> 58:05.309
Also, flying drones round the clock

58:05.343 --> 58:06.578
To try to gather any civilians.

58:10.381 --> 58:12.817
The president can give his order at any time after that.

58:12.851 --> 58:15.086
I take it we are set to evac?

58:15.119 --> 58:17.922
We started on that already, sir. Good job.

58:35.006 --> 58:38.109
This is it. This is the border.

58:38.142 --> 58:39.844
Looks quiet enough.

58:43.047 --> 58:45.183
Are you guys sure we should be doing this?

58:45.216 --> 58:46.651
Yeah.

58:46.685 --> 58:48.620
Do you hear that?

58:51.756 --> 58:53.457
We need to get to cover.

58:53.491 --> 58:55.459
Wait. What?

58:55.493 --> 58:56.995
I just... I don't understand

58:57.028 --> 58:58.997
Why we're running from the Army.

58:59.030 --> 59:00.965
It doesn't make sense. It just doesn't feel right.

59:03.968 --> 59:05.136
Ladies, let's go!

59:29.260 --> 59:30.695
You've picked up others.

59:30.729 --> 59:32.163
Is there a list of the civilians somewhere

59:32.196 --> 59:33.865
That you've picked up that have come through here?

59:33.898 --> 59:35.266
Hey, hey. Is there a list?

59:35.299 --> 59:37.535
This is a complete and absolute

59:37.568 --> 59:39.938
Violation of my rights, man.

59:39.971 --> 59:41.372
I know people!

59:41.405 --> 59:43.842
I mean, real people!

59:43.875 --> 59:47.712
Not just, you know... Politically connected people!

59:47.746 --> 59:49.547
Hey! Don't push me, man!

59:49.580 --> 59:51.983
You know I'm saying? I know people!

59:54.218 --> 59:57.656
Oh, great. This is just great.

59:57.689 --> 01:00:01.392
Hey! Hey! You can't hold us here forever.

01:00:01.425 --> 01:00:02.560
I don't think they care, Vince.

01:00:02.593 --> 01:00:04.095
We're not terrorists!

01:00:04.128 --> 01:00:06.397
We're dealing with martial law here.

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:07.666
It's either their way or the highway.

01:00:07.699 --> 01:00:11.569
No, no. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:00:11.602 --> 01:00:15.139
We didn't come this far to be stopped now.

01:00:15.173 --> 01:00:18.442
We didn't come this far to get a rifle shoved up our butts.

01:00:18.476 --> 01:00:20.011
You just sit down for a second

01:00:20.044 --> 01:00:22.180
And give me some time to think, please?

01:00:39.731 --> 01:00:42.266
You are not using guns on US soldiers!

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.836
We will do whatever we need to do to survive.

01:00:47.939 --> 01:00:49.941
Well, I'm not gonna be a part of that.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.716
Help! Help us!

01:00:57.749 --> 01:00:59.984
Help us! Help, please.

01:01:00.018 --> 01:01:02.854
We're here!

01:01:04.088 --> 01:01:05.289
Why?

01:01:30.314 --> 01:01:33.617
Ah, Mrs. Lannon.

01:01:33.651 --> 01:01:35.353
I was happy to know that you were here

01:01:35.386 --> 01:01:37.288
And that you're alive and well.

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:40.792
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no.

01:01:40.825 --> 01:01:42.493
Are you sure you should be doing that?

01:01:42.526 --> 01:01:44.462
It's fine.

01:01:46.064 --> 01:01:47.465
Okay.

01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:54.038
Tony... The guy that I was with?

01:02:03.681 --> 01:02:04.849
Where am I?

01:02:04.883 --> 01:02:08.019
You're in a mobile military unit

01:02:08.052 --> 01:02:10.654
And the front line to what will either will be

01:02:10.688 --> 01:02:12.556
The beginning of the end of this disaster

01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:15.259
Or the beginning of the end of our planet.

01:02:15.293 --> 01:02:17.028
That's great.

01:02:17.061 --> 01:02:18.296
Now you see why I didn't let you out there

01:02:18.329 --> 01:02:19.297
Looking for your daughter.

01:02:19.330 --> 01:02:21.232
No.

01:02:23.567 --> 01:02:25.269
I'm so very sorry, Nancy.

01:02:28.773 --> 01:02:32.110
The alarms.

01:02:32.143 --> 01:02:34.078
Sir? Do we really need the alarms?

01:02:34.112 --> 01:02:36.815
Can't we just all assume that it's very bad all the time now

01:02:36.848 --> 01:02:38.349
And shut the alarms off?

01:02:38.382 --> 01:02:40.952
Sir, one of our recon drones picked up a massive storm

01:02:40.985 --> 01:02:42.286
Moving towards this entire area.

01:02:44.923 --> 01:02:47.491
If you'll excuse me. Be safe.

01:02:49.994 --> 01:02:50.895
SAFE.

01:02:54.799 --> 01:02:56.200
What's that?

01:02:56.234 --> 01:02:59.303
Operation S-A-F-E.

01:02:59.337 --> 01:03:00.905
SAFE.

01:03:00.939 --> 01:03:02.373
Why did you take my files?

01:03:02.406 --> 01:03:05.376
Why'd you rename them and then lock me out?

01:03:09.613 --> 01:03:12.516
Oh, no, it wasn't me.

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:14.853
No, we all follow orders here.

01:03:14.886 --> 01:03:19.090
But I can say this.

01:03:19.123 --> 01:03:20.859
Your find, Nancy Lannon...

01:03:24.495 --> 01:03:27.298
Is going to save the world.

01:03:27.331 --> 01:03:30.068
Well, we hope so anyway.

01:03:30.101 --> 01:03:32.536
How?

01:03:33.938 --> 01:03:36.640
And that's the part that's classified.

01:03:38.142 --> 01:03:40.278
God be with you and your family.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.128
Think these guys are here to help you?

01:03:57.161 --> 01:03:59.931
Think they're your friends?

01:03:59.964 --> 01:04:03.467
We're your friends. You be dead without us.

01:04:03.501 --> 01:04:05.937
How could you do this?

01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:07.471
How could we do this?

01:04:07.505 --> 01:04:11.442
Call it survival instinct. We don't want to die.

01:04:11.475 --> 01:04:15.113
Once you realize that your government doesn't care about you,

01:04:15.146 --> 01:04:19.183
That freedom and equality are myths perpetrated upon us

01:04:19.217 --> 01:04:20.651
Under the disguise of democracy...

01:04:22.186 --> 01:04:25.856
Then... Then you'll know the truth.

01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:28.960
Hell, they'd just round us up like cattle,

01:04:28.993 --> 01:04:32.363
Send us to some military camp or some crap like that,

01:04:32.396 --> 01:04:34.298
Treat us like mules.

01:04:34.332 --> 01:04:35.866
We're close here.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.903
We're close to safety and we're close to freedom.

01:04:38.937 --> 01:04:40.304
Now let's go!

01:04:40.338 --> 01:04:42.806
No. I said let's go!

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.144
We're not going anywhere with you guys.

01:04:48.479 --> 01:04:50.814
We're not asking you.

01:04:50.848 --> 01:04:54.152
We're telling you. Move.

01:04:56.054 --> 01:04:58.222
Now!

01:05:11.335 --> 01:05:12.603
These things are getting closer.

01:05:12.636 --> 01:05:13.537
Move it.

01:05:28.186 --> 01:05:30.388
I'm ready, you son of a bitch.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.728
Repeat, this is not a drill.

01:05:37.761 --> 01:05:38.997
Attention, storms approaching.

01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:40.731
ETA 90 minutes.

01:05:40.764 --> 01:05:42.166
I repeat, this is not a drill.

01:05:44.435 --> 01:05:47.338
I got to tell you, I didn't think it'd end like this.

01:05:47.371 --> 01:05:50.241
Like what?

01:05:50.274 --> 01:05:53.277
I don't know, just sitting here

01:05:53.311 --> 01:05:55.546
Waiting for God knows what.

01:05:58.616 --> 01:05:59.717
What'd you expect?

01:06:02.053 --> 01:06:04.222
Happier ending, I guess.

01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:09.493
Happy endings are so 1990s, Vince.

01:06:09.527 --> 01:06:12.630
Oh, okay, writer man. How's this supposed to go down?

01:06:14.298 --> 01:06:16.200
Actually, I have no idea.

01:06:16.234 --> 01:06:20.771
Steve Lannon, author extraordinaire, has no idea?

01:06:22.273 --> 01:06:24.708
I'm gonna stop buying your books.

01:06:24.742 --> 01:06:27.945
You never bought them, Vince. I gave them to you.

01:06:27.978 --> 01:06:30.914
I'm gonna stop reading them, for sure.

01:06:30.948 --> 01:06:33.084
Get in line. I didn't think you could read.

01:06:35.719 --> 01:06:37.355
Is your name Steve Lannon?

01:06:37.388 --> 01:06:38.956
Yeah.

01:06:38.989 --> 01:06:42.660
Of 4255 Vantage Avenue Sunnyvale, California?

01:06:42.693 --> 01:06:44.195
Yes, why?

01:06:44.228 --> 01:06:45.863
Can you come with me, please?

01:06:45.896 --> 01:06:48.799
Sure.

01:06:48.832 --> 01:06:50.534
You can stay, sir.

01:06:57.675 --> 01:06:59.743
The plot thickens.

01:07:08.552 --> 01:07:09.653
Steven!

01:07:09.687 --> 01:07:12.923
Steven.

01:07:12.956 --> 01:07:15.793
Nancy! Steven. Steven.

01:07:15.826 --> 01:07:16.827
Oh, my God.

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:18.762
I thought I'd lost you.

01:07:18.796 --> 01:07:20.598
How did you get here? Are you okay?

01:07:20.631 --> 01:07:23.167
I'm fine. I'm fine. I was looking for Rachel.

01:07:23.201 --> 01:07:24.802
So am I. That's why I'm here.

01:07:24.835 --> 01:07:27.538
Do you know where she is? Do you have any information?

01:07:27.571 --> 01:07:29.907
Apparently in the chaos, some underground movement

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:32.042
Spread the word about a location,

01:07:32.076 --> 01:07:34.178
A safe haven from the disasters.

01:07:35.713 --> 01:07:38.949
They think that the government is keeping this location hidden

01:07:38.982 --> 01:07:41.485
Just for the elite, the privileged few.

01:07:41.519 --> 01:07:45.156
If Rachel is still alive, I think that's where she'd try to get to.

01:07:45.189 --> 01:07:47.658
Yeah, definitely. Definitely.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.836
Sir.

01:07:58.869 --> 01:08:02.373
We just got word of an exchange of gunfire by the border.

01:08:02.406 --> 01:08:04.675
Two of our National Guardsmen are down.

01:08:04.708 --> 01:08:06.444
Would you like to send a team to take care of it?

01:08:06.477 --> 01:08:07.711
No. Send a drone.

01:08:07.745 --> 01:08:09.713
I want to see exactly what we're working with.

01:08:09.747 --> 01:08:11.349
Yes, sir.

01:08:21.925 --> 01:08:23.794
You are animals.

01:08:23.827 --> 01:08:26.163
Disgusting animals. Hey, shut it!

01:08:26.197 --> 01:08:27.865
What are you gonna do, hit me?

01:08:27.898 --> 01:08:29.500
Allie. What?

01:08:29.533 --> 01:08:31.234
Look around.

01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:34.537
We are the stupidest people on Earth!

01:08:34.572 --> 01:08:36.006
What are we doing?

01:08:36.038 --> 01:08:37.608
Hey! We're alive.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.243
And right now, that counts for everything.

01:08:40.278 --> 01:08:42.546
All I see are two murdering kidnappers

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.448
That disgust me.

01:08:49.487 --> 01:08:50.787
Go check it out.

01:08:55.091 --> 01:08:56.394
Stay.

01:09:00.231 --> 01:09:01.532
These are the suspects

01:09:01.564 --> 01:09:02.933
From the shooting at the border.

01:09:02.966 --> 01:09:04.100
We have an ID on any of them?

01:09:04.134 --> 01:09:05.269
No, sir.

01:09:05.303 --> 01:09:07.270
We think that they think this area

01:09:07.305 --> 01:09:09.038
Will provide them sanctuary.

01:09:09.072 --> 01:09:12.009
Guess it doesn't matter. They had their warnings.

01:09:12.042 --> 01:09:13.877
Yes, sir.

01:09:34.898 --> 01:09:36.667
Where are the sirens?

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:39.069
Incoming! Take cover!

01:09:39.102 --> 01:09:41.138
Incoming! Take cover! That's better.

01:09:48.511 --> 01:09:49.979
Sir, we have an incoming call

01:09:50.013 --> 01:09:52.850
From the president on the secure line.

01:09:52.883 --> 01:09:55.486
I guess he's done waiting.

01:09:55.519 --> 01:09:57.488
Start to move everyone out of here.

01:09:57.521 --> 01:09:59.290
Airlift should be here in 30.

01:09:59.323 --> 01:10:00.691
Sir, yes, sir.

01:10:06.764 --> 01:10:09.667
Whoa, whoa. Out! Out!

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.102
Front row seats to the end of the world, huh?

01:10:12.135 --> 01:10:13.170
Hopefully, we'll be gone by then.

01:10:13.203 --> 01:10:14.672
Vince, what are you doing here?

01:10:14.705 --> 01:10:15.906
I forgot to tell you. Vince came with me.

01:10:15.939 --> 01:10:18.509
Hey, Nance. Hey, Vin. Hi.

01:10:18.542 --> 01:10:20.678
I thought you hated me? I do.

01:10:23.381 --> 01:10:25.349
You know, if the man in tights were here,

01:10:25.383 --> 01:10:27.585
He'd circle the planet a million times and turn back time.

01:10:27.618 --> 01:10:30.654
If I were him, I'd push the planet back into orbit.

01:10:31.922 --> 01:10:35.192
Push the planet back. What?

01:10:35.225 --> 01:10:36.527
That's is what they weren't telling me.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.861
That's why they stole my files.

01:10:37.895 --> 01:10:40.298
About what? Oh, God.

01:10:40.331 --> 01:10:42.400
We are a go for Operation SAFE.

01:10:42.433 --> 01:10:47.371
I repeat. We are a go for Operation S-A-F-E.

01:10:47.405 --> 01:10:50.574
What's Operation SAFE? What are you doing here?

01:10:50.608 --> 01:10:52.142
At ease.

01:10:52.175 --> 01:10:54.312
You're gonna blow it, aren't you?

01:10:54.345 --> 01:10:56.113
The eight nuclear nations

01:10:56.146 --> 01:10:59.216
Are sending a combined 500 kilotons of nuclear weapons

01:10:59.249 --> 01:11:01.685
To the coordinates on that wall.

01:11:01.719 --> 01:11:04.355
The combined effect will not only detonate,

01:11:04.388 --> 01:11:06.324
But it will ignite the single largest

01:11:06.357 --> 01:11:09.893
Natural gas reservoir on this planet.

01:11:09.927 --> 01:11:11.362
Your reserve.

01:11:14.264 --> 01:11:17.167
This rogue planet has taken us for a ride

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.304
And it's time for us to end it.

01:11:20.338 --> 01:11:22.773
So those coordinates, that's not a safe haven?

01:11:22.806 --> 01:11:24.575
That's right.

01:11:24.608 --> 01:11:26.710
Operation SAFE is no safe haven.

01:11:26.744 --> 01:11:30.147
Hackers intercepted the international communiqué

01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:32.182
As the plan was being developed.

01:11:32.215 --> 01:11:33.684
They botched it.

01:11:33.717 --> 01:11:35.252
Half the reason we have troops here at all

01:11:35.285 --> 01:11:36.954
Is to clean up that mess.

01:11:36.987 --> 01:11:40.491
Am I crazy or is that Rachel?

01:11:42.593 --> 01:11:45.496
Hey, what is that? Where was this taken?

01:11:54.304 --> 01:11:56.039
Make yourselves comfortable.

01:11:58.642 --> 01:12:01.244
We're gonna be here a while.

01:12:01.278 --> 01:12:04.615
What are you guys gonna do with us?

01:12:04.648 --> 01:12:06.817
You ain't figured it out yet?

01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:08.118
We're starting over.

01:12:08.151 --> 01:12:10.421
Whole world's starting over.

01:12:10.454 --> 01:12:13.491
He and I are starting over with you.

01:12:18.095 --> 01:12:20.364
Yeah, right.

01:12:26.904 --> 01:12:28.472
Uh-uh-uh!

01:12:28.506 --> 01:12:31.141
Let go of me! Get off of me!

01:12:31.174 --> 01:12:33.110
Let go!

01:12:35.713 --> 01:12:39.082
Don't even think about it, sweetheart.

01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.523
Oh, God, that's her. She's alive. [siren wails]

01:12:45.556 --> 01:12:48.158
I'm going to get our daughter. Mrs. Lannon!

01:12:59.069 --> 01:13:00.504
Mrs. Lannon!

01:13:00.538 --> 01:13:02.139
Mrs. Lannon, I can't let you make this decision.

01:13:02.172 --> 01:13:04.508
My daughter is out there. She's being held hostage!

01:13:04.542 --> 01:13:06.009
You need to get some guys to go get her.

01:13:06.043 --> 01:13:09.346
I can't do that. An executive order has been given.

01:13:09.379 --> 01:13:10.714
This is the point of no return.

01:13:10.748 --> 01:13:12.850
She's still alive. She's out there!

01:13:12.883 --> 01:13:15.453
There is no way to get anyone out in time.

01:13:15.486 --> 01:13:17.721
And right now I can't risk anyone's life.

01:13:17.755 --> 01:13:20.123
No one is going back into the zone.

01:13:20.157 --> 01:13:21.692
We're not talking about anyone. We're talking about me.

01:13:21.725 --> 01:13:23.060
Let me go. Give me a truck.

01:13:23.093 --> 01:13:25.128
Give us a truck. Excuse me?

01:13:25.162 --> 01:13:26.697
I would rather die knowing that I tried to save my daughter

01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:28.699
Than be alive knowing that I didn't.

01:13:28.732 --> 01:13:29.900
The storm.

01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:41.411
We're running out of time. Come on, we got to go.

01:13:43.581 --> 01:13:45.916
Listen, these guys are armed and dangerous.

01:13:45.949 --> 01:13:47.551
You're gonna need guns.

01:13:47.585 --> 01:13:50.353
A GPS tracker will help you pinpoint their exact location,

01:13:50.387 --> 01:13:51.655
But the rest is on you.

01:13:51.689 --> 01:13:53.023
You got about two hours

01:13:53.056 --> 01:13:55.358
Before all hell is unleashed on your heads.

01:13:55.392 --> 01:13:58.929
I hope you find her.

01:13:58.962 --> 01:14:00.464
Godspeed.

01:14:02.766 --> 01:14:03.934
Can I go?

01:14:03.967 --> 01:14:05.869
No. No. Yeah.

01:14:08.672 --> 01:14:10.407
Sorry.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.543
She hates me.

01:14:12.576 --> 01:14:14.978
She really hates me.

01:14:43.373 --> 01:14:45.308
We're getting closer. We're almost there.

01:14:45.342 --> 01:14:47.511
Look out!

01:14:49.012 --> 01:14:50.213
Brace yourself!

01:14:51.481 --> 01:14:53.551
Hold on!

01:14:58.055 --> 01:14:59.189
Hold on!

01:15:33.023 --> 01:15:34.958
It's getting worse.

01:15:36.359 --> 01:15:38.629
There is no safe haven.

01:15:40.230 --> 01:15:42.065
We're all gonna die.

01:15:45.535 --> 01:15:46.837
Does that thought scare you?

01:15:54.845 --> 01:15:57.848
I kind of find it liberating.

01:16:11.428 --> 01:16:12.996
There it is.

01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:28.846
What's the plan?

01:16:28.879 --> 01:16:31.414
I don't know. I'm writing this as I go along.

01:16:31.448 --> 01:16:33.050
Write a good one.

01:16:42.225 --> 01:16:44.327
I can tell I don't like this one already.

01:16:48.065 --> 01:16:49.132
Go check it out.

01:17:04.948 --> 01:17:06.616
So what's going to happen to them?

01:17:06.650 --> 01:17:08.385
How are they supposed to get out?

01:17:08.418 --> 01:17:11.722
Fortunately, it's not my problem.

01:17:22.432 --> 01:17:25.703
Carl! We got company!

01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:28.471
What do they want?

01:17:28.505 --> 01:17:30.507
Military!

01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:33.176
They're just sitting there.

01:17:35.178 --> 01:17:36.780
Think we're surrounded?

01:17:39.282 --> 01:17:42.019
This area has been designated for a military strike.

01:17:42.052 --> 01:17:45.388
A mandatory evacuation has been ordered.

01:17:45.422 --> 01:17:46.757
Come out with your hands up

01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:49.993
And you will be taken to safety.

01:17:50.027 --> 01:17:51.161
What?

01:17:51.194 --> 01:17:52.930
That sounds like my dad.

01:17:52.963 --> 01:17:54.531
Lies!

01:17:54.564 --> 01:17:57.200
They're all lies! We ain't leaving!

01:17:57.234 --> 01:17:58.802
Put your damn gun down!

01:17:58.836 --> 01:18:02.072
Yeah, but they ain't shooting!

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:04.507
What, are you crazy?

01:18:04.541 --> 01:18:06.810
Something ain't right.

01:18:06.844 --> 01:18:08.912
They ain't doing nothing!

01:18:17.287 --> 01:18:18.455
Dad?

01:18:25.428 --> 01:18:27.497
Mike.

01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:28.832
Carl!

01:18:28.866 --> 01:18:30.567
They have nukes headed here now.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.702
They're gonna blow this place sky-high.

01:18:32.736 --> 01:18:34.504
We don't have any time.

01:18:34.537 --> 01:18:36.006
Put your damn gun down.

01:18:36.039 --> 01:18:38.175
Nuke this place? Don't make no sense.

01:18:38.208 --> 01:18:41.845
You ain't military. You can't even hold a gun proper.

01:18:45.682 --> 01:18:47.084
Carl!

01:18:47.117 --> 01:18:48.919
You ain't never hold a gun in your life.

01:18:48.952 --> 01:18:51.688
I'm not military. And I'm not lying.

01:18:51.721 --> 01:18:54.024
The only lie was that this is a safe haven.

01:18:54.057 --> 01:18:55.859
They're gonna blow about 1,000 square miles of this place

01:18:55.893 --> 01:18:57.194
To try to save the planet

01:18:57.227 --> 01:19:01.031
And right now you are wasting valuable time.

01:19:03.566 --> 01:19:05.635
Carl!

01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:09.807
Dad! Carl!

01:19:14.577 --> 01:19:16.246
No.

01:19:23.053 --> 01:19:26.356
How's this, huh? Don't move.

01:19:26.389 --> 01:19:28.025
Do it.

01:19:32.295 --> 01:19:33.496
Don't even think about it.

01:19:45.108 --> 01:19:47.110
He doesn't have to think about it. I will.

01:19:47.144 --> 01:19:49.246
What do you want to do with these guys?

01:20:13.971 --> 01:20:15.572
Where are we going?

01:20:15.605 --> 01:20:17.440
As far as away from this place as we can!

01:20:17.474 --> 01:20:19.109
It can't be far enough.

01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:25.815
They ain't gonna nuke this place, right?

01:20:25.849 --> 01:20:27.918
No. No one nukes their own country.

01:21:00.183 --> 01:21:03.186
You got to be kidding me!

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:04.654
God!

01:21:06.823 --> 01:21:08.325
Is this for real?

01:21:12.695 --> 01:21:14.932
We were never gonna make it anyway.

01:21:17.567 --> 01:21:18.468
We tried.

01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:21.905
At least we tried.

01:21:35.752 --> 01:21:37.187
No.

01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:40.190
This cannot be how this ends. No!

01:21:52.269 --> 01:21:54.004
I have a visual.

01:21:54.037 --> 01:21:57.174
There they are! Let's move.

01:21:57.207 --> 01:21:59.209
We got to get them out of there.

01:21:59.242 --> 01:22:01.011
Roger.

01:22:39.516 --> 01:22:40.883
You hear that?

01:22:40.917 --> 01:22:42.452
Told you they wouldn't leave us.

01:23:02.805 --> 01:23:05.975
What made you change your mind?

01:23:06.009 --> 01:23:07.777
Well, let's just say

01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:09.479
It was the right thing to do.

01:23:09.512 --> 01:23:12.949
Listen, I'm glad you're all okay,

01:23:12.982 --> 01:23:15.018
But we're not out of this yet.

01:23:15.052 --> 01:23:18.121
We have incoming at T-minus 20, 19, 18...

01:23:18.155 --> 01:23:21.424
Do we have distance? 
Not yet. No, sir.

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:33.103
Five, four,

01:23:33.136 --> 01:23:36.973
Three, two, one.

01:23:37.006 --> 01:23:38.608
Stand by.

01:23:52.322 --> 01:23:53.523
Hold on!

01:24:04.434 --> 01:24:06.603
Hold on!

01:24:06.636 --> 01:24:07.570
Whoa!

01:24:21.551 --> 01:24:23.853
When will we know if it worked?

01:24:28.758 --> 01:24:30.793
It's gonna work. It's gonna work.
