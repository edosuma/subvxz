00:02.066 --> 00:02.500
This program is rated G

00:04.233 --> 00:07.300
and is suitable for
general audiences.

00:45.867 --> 00:46.800
Hi!

00:46.934 --> 00:47.900
Man on phone:
You need to hurry!

00:48.033 --> 00:49.567
The wedding's already started.

00:49.700 --> 00:52.266
Yes, I'm here now.
Just keep them entertained.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.500
I'll be there in a jiff.
Okay, bye.

00:55.700 --> 00:57.567
No, no, no! Not again!

00:58.700 --> 01:00.467
Ugh! Okay.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.667
Here's the deal.
You can break down tomorrow,

01:02.800 --> 01:05.500
I'm free all day,
but I can't do this right now.

01:05.633 --> 01:06.967
Got it?

01:09.700 --> 01:11.100
Oh, I owe you one!

01:33.834 --> 01:35.867
Come on, little guy.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.333
I know it doesn't seem like it,
but if you come with me,

01:39.467 --> 01:41.633
you will be free to fly away,

01:41.767 --> 01:43.633
migrate and help pollinate
the world.

01:43.767 --> 01:45.800
What do you say?

01:55.166 --> 01:57.333
Where is she?

01:57.467 --> 01:59.066
Come on.

02:00.734 --> 02:02.667
Come on! Oh! Hey.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.100
They're about to say their vows.

02:09.233 --> 02:10.467
I know, I know, trust me,

02:10.600 --> 02:12.567
everything that could go wrong
today has gone wrong.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.066
Well, this one can't.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.800
They've only paid us half
so far.

02:27.700 --> 02:30.100
Pastor: Having witnessed
their pledge of fidelity

02:30.233 --> 02:31.400
to one another...

02:31.533 --> 02:34.567
To love, honour,
and cherish one another

02:34.700 --> 02:36.300
in the presence of this gathering.

02:36.433 --> 02:38.900
And by the power vested in me,

02:39.033 --> 02:43.700
it is my honour to now pronounce
you husband and wife.

02:43.834 --> 02:46.433
Now you may kiss the bride.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.967
Crowd:
Aww.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.467
You okay?

03:20.934 --> 03:23.500
Yeah, I'm just happy for her.

03:23.633 --> 03:25.433
And happy that we pulled
this off.

03:26.934 --> 03:30.433
I'm your best friend, Emily.
I know it still hurts.

03:32.467 --> 03:34.467
I'm over it.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.100
It's not something you just
get over.

03:37.233 --> 03:39.000
Well, you're the one who keeps
bringing it up

03:39.133 --> 03:40.700
every time we do a wedding.

03:40.834 --> 03:43.800
And I told you I can handle the
weddings on my own.

03:43.934 --> 03:45.600
Come on.

03:45.734 --> 03:48.834
Let's go get ready for
tomorrow's birthday party.

03:58.934 --> 04:02.100
Does anyone know what kind of
butterfly this is?

04:02.233 --> 04:03.867
How about the birthday girl?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.667
A blue butterfly!

04:05.800 --> 04:07.834
Emily:
That's true, it is blue.

04:07.967 --> 04:11.033
And close, it's called an
Eastern Tailed Blue.

04:11.166 --> 04:12.567
He just emerged yesterday.

04:12.700 --> 04:14.066
How do you know if it's a boy?

04:14.200 --> 04:17.767
See the black spots on the top
of his wings?

04:17.900 --> 04:20.066
The females don't have them.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.867
Amanda:
What's he doing?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.734
It takes a few hours for his
wings to dry

04:23.867 --> 04:25.867
and harden enough for
him to fly.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.867
Is he going to fly away?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.200
Mm-hm. Pretty soon.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.934
This is all very new to him.

04:33.066 --> 04:35.867
Does anyone know what we
butterflies eat?

04:37.500 --> 04:38.600
Man:
Fruit slices.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.533
Or sugar water.

04:43.133 --> 04:45.400
Yes, very good.

04:45.533 --> 04:48.400
Daddy, she was asking us.

04:48.533 --> 04:53.033
Sorry.

04:56.834 --> 04:58.266
Don't worry, he won't hurt you.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.467
It tickles.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.667
That's because he knows you're
just sweet as sugar water.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.200
Where is he going?

05:09.800 --> 05:11.767
He's off to do his part
in the world.

05:13.133 --> 05:15.633
I have some more Eastern Tailed
Blues over here.

05:15.767 --> 05:17.166
Come see.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.800
That weasel.

05:28.934 --> 05:30.300
My neighbour?

05:30.433 --> 05:33.233
No, Mandy Fischer.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.166
I booked that party too

05:35.300 --> 05:38.066
and she swooped in
and undercut me again.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.300
Garrett: Oh, yeah,
I think got a flier from her.

05:40.433 --> 05:41.900
And she was cheaper.

05:42.033 --> 05:44.000
Well, there's reason for that.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.000
Oh, Mandy!

05:53.033 --> 05:56.100
Mandy:
Emily! Nice party.

05:56.233 --> 05:58.967
A whopping one butterfly
you released there, huh?

05:59.100 --> 06:02.066
Hmm, yeah, we like to teach our
party guests a thing or two

06:02.200 --> 06:04.300
about butterflies
before we set them free.

06:04.433 --> 06:07.166
Yawn. They must love that.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.400
Passing off any moths as
monarchs today?

06:10.533 --> 06:11.967
Whatever.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.200
Time for me to run.
Gotta release a few more.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.834
Several more.

06:16.967 --> 06:19.500
More, as in, more than you.

06:29.633 --> 06:32.000
Hey, I-- I only paid for 25.

06:32.133 --> 06:35.233
Oh, this is on the house.
I won't be out-butterflied.

06:44.133 --> 06:46.734
Hey, kids!
Come over here now!

06:50.200 --> 06:52.066
Kids:
Wow! Whoa!

06:55.467 --> 06:57.633
Girl: So many!
Look at the big one!

07:00.333 --> 07:02.266
And more!

07:05.500 --> 07:07.300
Are you kidding me?

07:11.767 --> 07:14.066
Oh, come on, little guys.

07:21.433 --> 07:23.266
Girl:
they're so colourful!

07:23.400 --> 07:25.033
Who wants to see more?

08:03.600 --> 08:04.700
How'd it go?

08:04.834 --> 08:07.633
Great, five dozen new Blue
Swallow Tails

08:07.767 --> 08:10.100
are out making the world a
better place.

08:10.233 --> 08:11.633
I thought we only had two dozen
for this party.

08:11.767 --> 08:13.266
Yeah, there was an incident.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.767
What kind of incident?

08:14.900 --> 08:17.166
A Mandy Fischer kind of incident.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.700
Emily!
I know! I know!

08:19.834 --> 08:22.000
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.333
She's just so smug.

08:24.467 --> 08:26.100
And I think she shorts people
on butterflies.

08:26.233 --> 08:27.767
That goes against the code.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.000
"The code?"

08:29.133 --> 08:30.467
Okay, we had a bumper crop anyway.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.700
That's beside the point.

08:31.834 --> 08:34.834
Half of her butterflies
were probably fake.

08:34.967 --> 08:36.100
Garrett:
Emily?

08:36.233 --> 08:38.033
Oh.

08:38.166 --> 08:40.767
Uh, sorry, before you leave,
Amanda wanted to say bye.

08:40.900 --> 08:43.467
Oh, yeah, I'll be right there.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.867
Is that the dad?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.967
Yes, it's the dad.

08:54.433 --> 08:55.700
What?

08:57.133 --> 08:58.533
Stop it.

09:02.533 --> 09:04.667
Anytime. Seriously.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.734
I look forward to your call.

09:06.867 --> 09:08.166
Anytime.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.633
Toodles.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.767
Oh, uh, you--
you left this behind.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.834
Emily: Oh, actually, here.
Take one.

09:21.967 --> 09:24.100
Put it up at your office
or something.

09:24.233 --> 09:25.700
Free advertising.

09:25.834 --> 09:27.867
Look, I just want to thank you.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.200
You know, for the extra butterflies.

09:30.333 --> 09:31.533
Kids had a great time.

09:31.667 --> 09:34.066
Sorry if it got weird.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.834
Weird? What's weird about
two dueling butterfly parties?

09:37.967 --> 09:39.567
I think your friend Mandy got a
kick out of it too.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.433
Friend...

09:41.567 --> 09:44.033
Between you and me,
that educational bit,

09:44.166 --> 09:45.600
it was a nice touch.

09:45.734 --> 09:47.734
The kids, they weren't
bored at all.

09:47.867 --> 09:49.066
Thank you.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.767
Amanda? Come over here.

09:51.900 --> 09:53.533
The nice lady is leaving.

09:53.667 --> 09:58.066
Great, I'm the "nice lady."

09:58.200 --> 09:59.533
Aww.

09:59.667 --> 10:03.767
Thank you so much, this was the
best birthday party ever.

10:03.900 --> 10:06.767
Oh, I'm so glad! I hope the rest
of it is just as fun.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.934
Thanks, Emily. Bye!

10:09.066 --> 10:10.300
Bye!

10:11.734 --> 10:13.433
It was a pleasure meeting you.

10:13.567 --> 10:15.300
Yeah, you too.

10:18.066 --> 10:19.967
Oh, uh, sorry.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.533
Hey, Jill.
I'm so glad you called.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.567
Yeah, I'm just with Amanda
right now.

10:38.967 --> 10:40.433
Jill could be anybody.

10:40.567 --> 10:42.767
Like who?
His mother.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.767
Who calls their mother
by her first name?

10:44.900 --> 10:47.500
His sister, a business colleague.

10:47.633 --> 10:49.033
Nah, not the way he answered it.

10:49.166 --> 10:51.100
Mandy I can handle.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.300
Jill is the unknown.

10:53.433 --> 10:56.767
But it doesn't matter because he
probably thinks I'm crazy anyway

10:56.900 --> 10:59.633
after my showdown at the
butterfly corral.

10:59.767 --> 11:03.200
No, he thought that was funny.
I thought that was crazy.

11:04.967 --> 11:06.400
Is that from today?

11:06.533 --> 11:07.667
Mm-hm.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.066
And how did you get it?

11:09.200 --> 11:11.100
When you went to say goodbye to
your hot single dad,

11:11.233 --> 11:12.867
one of the parents was about to
throw it away.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.567
I rescued it.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.533
Mm-hm. You rescued it?

11:16.667 --> 11:18.667
Yeah, how about you rescue
a salad later?

11:20.533 --> 11:21.934
Mmm.

11:23.667 --> 11:27.834
Okay, fine. And I was not going
over to say goodbye to him.

11:27.967 --> 11:30.000
I was invited over
to say goodbye to his daughter.

11:30.133 --> 11:33.066
Mm-hm, by him.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.166
We're not supposed to flirt with
clients anyway,

11:35.300 --> 11:36.667
it's bad etiquette.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.900
The point is,
this is the first time in a year

11:39.033 --> 11:40.667
you've even shown so much
as a pulse

11:40.800 --> 11:44.100
in the presence of another guy.
That is progress.

11:44.233 --> 11:46.900
Well, he is cute.

11:47.033 --> 11:49.233
And he's nice.

11:49.367 --> 11:51.433
And unavailable.

11:53.633 --> 11:55.200
Sweetheart?

11:55.333 --> 11:56.533
Hey!
You know,

11:56.667 --> 11:57.767
the doorbell
does work.

11:57.900 --> 12:00.266
Nonsense. Adam!

12:00.400 --> 12:01.633
How are you doing?

12:01.767 --> 12:02.900
Just fine, Larry.

12:03.033 --> 12:05.033
Well, I thought we'd bake.

12:09.066 --> 12:12.166
You know, to help you get your
mind off things.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.433
Dad, it's been a year.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.467
I don't need to keep taking
my mind off things.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.934
Nonsense. A father knows.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.066
Oh, did you happen to call
that young man

12:26.200 --> 12:28.266
I met at the gas station
the other day?

12:28.400 --> 12:30.166
You mean the perfect stranger
who probably thought

12:30.300 --> 12:31.567
you were insane?

12:31.700 --> 12:33.667
He gave me his number!
He was interested.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.800
You made it sound like I was
desperate for a date.

12:35.934 --> 12:37.433
You are.
Dad!

12:39.367 --> 12:42.100
Aww, poor kid.

12:42.233 --> 12:44.300
I'm just trying to look out
for you.

12:44.433 --> 12:47.967
Okay, can we do this tomorrow?
It's been a long day.

12:48.100 --> 12:51.000
You raise butterflies.
How hard can that be?

12:54.033 --> 12:56.300
Um, incredibly hard, actually.

12:56.433 --> 12:58.400
Catch you later. Bye, Larry.

12:58.533 --> 13:00.533
Oh, you're leaving?

13:00.667 --> 13:02.066
Oh, I have a date.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.200
See?

13:05.333 --> 13:06.667
I thought that was canceled.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.500
See ya.

13:08.633 --> 13:10.233
Just gonna rescue this.

13:11.367 --> 13:14.967
Well, looks like it's just us.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.633
Just us.

13:16.767 --> 13:19.233
Okay, what are we baking, Dad?

13:19.367 --> 13:22.900
I am thinking a lemon loaf.

13:23.033 --> 13:24.233
Lemon loaf?
Yeah.

13:24.367 --> 13:25.500
That's new.

13:29.333 --> 13:30.834
Hey.

13:30.967 --> 13:32.734
Morning. Did they arrive?

13:32.867 --> 13:34.567
Yep, fresh off the farm.

13:34.700 --> 13:36.500
You sure there's 200 in there?

13:36.633 --> 13:37.800
Emily:
Well, there better be.

13:37.934 --> 13:40.667
The Stromwall retirement party
is in four weeks.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.567
Barely enough time.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.066
I know you mentioned
there's a code and everything,

13:45.200 --> 13:47.700
but is anyone really
going to count?

13:47.834 --> 13:50.233
They asked for 200 butterflies,
they're paying

13:50.367 --> 13:52.367
for 200 butterflies,
we will deliver them--

13:52.500 --> 13:55.233
200 butterflies. I know.

13:55.367 --> 13:58.133
But this is going to be the
biggest release we've ever made.

13:58.266 --> 13:59.467
We might need help.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.266
I know.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.200
And a new compressor.

14:03.333 --> 14:07.467
Or we won't have any butterflies
to deliver.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.734
Oh. It's them.

14:11.867 --> 14:13.300
Them?

14:17.333 --> 14:18.533
Hi!
Hi!

14:18.667 --> 14:19.767
You're sure we're not intruding?

14:19.900 --> 14:22.066
Oh, no, not at all.
Hi, Amanda.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.367
Hi!

14:23.500 --> 14:24.900
You made quite the impression on
this one.

14:25.033 --> 14:26.133
She's about to start a--

14:26.266 --> 14:27.900
I want to tell her, Daddy!

14:28.033 --> 14:29.567
Sorry.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.533
So I've been really interested
in butterflies since my party.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.266
Her school is doing a project
on butter--

14:34.400 --> 14:36.533
Daddy!
Sorry.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.934
So that's why I want to get a
tour of a butterfly farm.

14:39.066 --> 14:42.600
Oh, well, you came to
the right spot.

14:42.734 --> 14:46.767
Oh, um, this is Adam, you met
him at the party.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.433
Hi.
Garrett.

14:48.567 --> 14:49.867
I remember.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.967
Amanda is interested
in what we do.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.500
Come on in,
I'll show you guys around.

14:58.266 --> 15:01.166
So this is where we keep all
the eggs and larva.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.166
It has to stay very clean

15:03.300 --> 15:04.667
and the temperature
has to be regulated

15:04.800 --> 15:07.300
so there's just the right warmth
and humidity.

15:07.433 --> 15:09.033
This is so cool.

15:11.767 --> 15:13.266
Come with me.

15:14.900 --> 15:17.533
First things first,
very important,

15:17.667 --> 15:19.967
we need to clean our hands.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.800
And then we go into what we call
the Flight House.

15:22.934 --> 15:24.033
That's where we keep--

15:24.166 --> 15:25.300
All the butterflies.

15:25.433 --> 15:27.200
That's right.

15:32.233 --> 15:34.967
So this is what we like to call
our butterfly sanctuary

15:35.100 --> 15:36.533
instead of a farm.

15:36.667 --> 15:39.600
We raise a lot of butterflies
just to set them free.

15:39.734 --> 15:41.500
Like a butterfly rescue.

15:41.633 --> 15:43.533
In a way, yes.

15:43.667 --> 15:46.333
Did you know Monarchs can fly
all the way to Mexico?

15:46.467 --> 15:48.266
I did know that.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.033
And that some flowers wouldn't
survive

15:50.166 --> 15:51.667
if butterflies didn't pollenate
them?

15:51.800 --> 15:53.467
Emily:
That's right.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.667
And that growing milkweed and
other plants is really good

15:55.800 --> 15:58.200
because a lot of their habitat
is being destroyed.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.200
Wow, you have done your
homework!

16:00.333 --> 16:02.367
Oh, you have no idea.

16:04.900 --> 16:07.166
Well, then you can see that this
isn't just a business.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.734
We're also helping the planet, too.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.600
And they're really pretty.

16:10.734 --> 16:12.166
They are really pretty,
aren't they?

16:12.300 --> 16:14.266
You're really pretty.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.533
My dad thinks so.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.567
I heard him talking to his
friend on the phone.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.400
Garrett:
Uh, Amanda.

16:19.533 --> 16:21.266
I, uh, I don't know what she
thought she heard...

16:21.400 --> 16:23.000
on the phone.

16:23.133 --> 16:25.066
You don't think she's pretty,
Daddy?

16:25.200 --> 16:27.367
Yes, I do.

16:27.500 --> 16:28.767
Told you.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.400
Thank you.

16:30.533 --> 16:32.500
Emily, a word?

16:32.633 --> 16:34.000
Yeah.

16:36.633 --> 16:37.734
Bingo.

16:37.867 --> 16:40.233
Oh, stop it!
It doesn't mean anything.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.900
You're worse than the kid.

16:43.033 --> 16:46.400
So this, obviously,
is where the butterfly emerges

16:46.533 --> 16:48.066
from the chrysalis.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.900
Different suppliers send us
our eggs and larva,

16:50.033 --> 16:51.500
as you saw in the lab.

16:51.633 --> 16:52.867
How long does it take
for a larva

16:53.000 --> 16:54.233
to turn into a caterpillar?

16:54.367 --> 16:55.834
Well, that depends on the weather.

16:55.967 --> 16:59.200
But from egg to butterfly,
usually about four weeks.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.767
Yeah, three to five days
for the egg to turn to larva.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.433
Which grow into caterpillars.

17:03.567 --> 17:06.767
That's right.
And about ten days

17:06.900 --> 17:08.767
for the caterpillar
to turn into a chrysalis.

17:08.900 --> 17:12.000
And about two weeks after that,
a butterfly comes out.

17:12.133 --> 17:14.066
Very good!

17:14.200 --> 17:15.800
I always used to just take that
stuff for granted,

17:15.934 --> 17:18.667
but it's pretty amazing.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.166
I like to think so, too.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.934
I have an idea.

17:22.066 --> 17:24.633
How would the two of you like to
help out at our next event?

17:24.767 --> 17:26.900
Sure! Can we, Daddy?

17:27.033 --> 17:29.100
If it's okay with you.

17:29.233 --> 17:31.600
Yeah. Great idea.

17:31.734 --> 17:33.000
Amanda: Awesome!

17:33.133 --> 17:34.900
Oh!

17:35.033 --> 17:36.400
Excuse me.

17:37.867 --> 17:39.934
Hello, this is Emily.

17:40.066 --> 17:43.033
Oh please, like Rebecca O'Keefe
would be calling me.

17:44.133 --> 17:45.967
Wait, this is really Rebecca
O'Keefe?

17:46.100 --> 17:47.934
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

17:48.066 --> 17:50.767
You'd like to meet?! When?

17:50.900 --> 17:52.633
Sure! Wait.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.166
Wait, how many?

17:55.767 --> 17:57.567
Okay. I'll see you then.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.233
That was Rebecca O'Keefe.

18:03.367 --> 18:05.333
Rebecca O'Keefe as in the
socialite heiress

18:05.467 --> 18:07.133
to the O'Keefe publishing
empire?

18:07.266 --> 18:08.700
Yep, that Rebecca O'Keefe.

18:08.834 --> 18:10.200
Who is getting married
in a few weeks?

18:10.333 --> 18:11.734
It's all over the tabloids.

18:11.867 --> 18:13.033
I guess I missed it.

18:13.166 --> 18:14.333
It's only going to be the most
talked about

18:14.467 --> 18:15.900
wedding of the year.

18:16.033 --> 18:18.800
She wants us to release 500
butterflies at her wedding.

18:18.934 --> 18:20.467
500 butterflies?

18:20.600 --> 18:21.800
500 butterflies.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.734
We're going to raise and release
500 butterflies.

18:23.867 --> 18:25.166
Mm-hm.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.667
When is the
wedding again?
Three weeks.

18:30.700 --> 18:33.233
My gosh.

18:37.967 --> 18:39.533
As you can see I don't have a
wedding planner.

18:39.667 --> 18:40.834
I don't trust them.

18:40.967 --> 18:42.133
I'll be making all
the decisions

18:42.266 --> 18:43.533
so you'll be dealing
directly with me.

18:43.667 --> 18:44.900
Despite what's in the media,

18:45.033 --> 18:46.400
it's going to be an
intimate wedding

18:46.533 --> 18:48.734
with only a few family
and friends.

18:48.867 --> 18:51.000
Great, I just need to know--

18:51.133 --> 18:52.400
Naturally, I'll be wearing white,

18:52.533 --> 18:54.700
and all the ladies attending
will be wearing off white.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.734
I don't want anyone to hijack
the floral.

18:56.867 --> 18:58.300
I really want the flowers
to pop.

18:58.433 --> 18:59.533
Got it.

18:59.667 --> 19:03.367
Is this... too light for my
complexion?

19:03.500 --> 19:06.467
Personally I would go with
a deeper colour.

19:09.333 --> 19:12.567
Agreed.
Do the Monarchs come in blue?

19:12.700 --> 19:15.300
No, they're orange
with black and white.

19:15.433 --> 19:20.133
Fine. What's the best compliment
to the color orange?

19:20.266 --> 19:24.300
Well, purple, but then I
wouldn't go as dark.

19:24.433 --> 19:27.700
Lavender is a nice colour,
and lavender smells great.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.533
I'm a conservationist, you know.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.233
I heard.

19:31.367 --> 19:32.700
So you can do it?

19:32.834 --> 19:37.567
Yes, 500 butterflies will be a
challenge but we're on it.

19:37.700 --> 19:41.266
I think you misunderstood.
I said at least 500.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.734
Whoever can deliver the most
gets the job.

19:43.867 --> 19:45.633
Whoever?

19:45.767 --> 19:49.400
Yeah, it's between you and, um,
what's her name? Fischer?

19:49.533 --> 19:51.467
Mandy Fischer.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.767
I've given her the same opportunity.

19:53.900 --> 19:56.600
She said it would be no
challenge at all.

19:56.734 --> 19:59.867
I'm not surprised.
But honestly,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.266
this many butterflies has never
been done before.

20:02.400 --> 20:06.033
So you can't do it?

20:06.166 --> 20:09.700
Nope, I'm the one
who will do it.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.467
Great. It will be
well worth your while,

20:12.600 --> 20:15.767
and not just the money,
but the publicity.

20:15.900 --> 20:17.734
Tah.

20:17.867 --> 20:19.233
Tah.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.266
Adam:
Mandy Fischer?!

20:23.400 --> 20:25.600
Doesn't she know she'll short
her by half?

20:25.734 --> 20:27.467
Or use Viceroys instead of
Monarchs?

20:27.600 --> 20:28.934
Rebecca O'Keefe will
never know the difference.

20:29.066 --> 20:30.900
I can't believe you agreed
to this.

20:31.033 --> 20:33.433
How was I supposed to say no?

20:33.567 --> 20:36.400
Rebecca O'Keefe is on the cover
of every magazine,

20:36.533 --> 20:40.266
which means this event will be
on the cover of every magazine.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.734
This little business of ours
could hit the big time.

20:43.867 --> 20:47.600
It'll hit something else if we
can't deliver 500 butterflies.

20:47.734 --> 20:49.800
At least 500.

20:49.934 --> 20:52.633
I'm not about to let Mandy
Fischer steal this one from me.

20:52.767 --> 20:54.867
Don't make it personal.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.300
I do this because I love butterflies

20:58.433 --> 21:00.333
and how they are connected
to our world.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.800
Mandy's only in it
for the money.

21:02.934 --> 21:06.433
Fair enough. But this is going
to be no easy task.

21:06.567 --> 21:08.834
I know. We're going to have to
expand our flight house.

21:08.967 --> 21:10.100
And we'll need new suppliers.

21:10.233 --> 21:12.033
And we'll need to buy
caterpillars, not eggs,

21:12.166 --> 21:13.700
or there won't be
enough time. Agreed.

21:13.834 --> 21:15.600
I already have calls into
Taylor Brothers

21:15.734 --> 21:17.033
and Margallo Farms
in Spokane.

21:17.166 --> 21:19.934
Good. Taylor's a friend of mine,
he'll prioritize for us.

21:20.066 --> 21:21.800
Well, we just need to beat Mandy
to them.

21:21.934 --> 21:23.667
Timing is everything.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.700
The eggs can't hatch a minute
too soon or a minute to late.

21:26.834 --> 21:30.433
And we still have the Stromwall
retirement party coming up.

21:30.567 --> 21:33.867
Oh my gosh, you're right.
Okay, all hands on deck.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.767
Speaking of which,
I'm running late.

21:36.900 --> 21:38.100
Need help with this one?

21:38.233 --> 21:40.834
No, it's small.
Another show and tell.

21:40.967 --> 21:44.633
Besides, Garrett and Amanda will
be there. Remember?

21:44.767 --> 21:46.467
Right. How could I forget.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.266
Mm-hm, yeah.
Nice one, by the way.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.533
See ya.

21:50.667 --> 21:53.100
I want to hear every detail.

21:53.233 --> 21:54.934
Mm-hm.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.633
Hi!

22:15.767 --> 22:18.467
Sorry, a million things
happening at once today.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.834
That's okay, how can we help?

22:19.967 --> 22:22.900
Uh, well, looks like the
birthday boy's mom

22:23.033 --> 22:24.600
has the decorations set up,

22:24.734 --> 22:26.300
so we just need
the show and tell

22:26.433 --> 22:28.233
and the butterflies.

22:31.867 --> 22:33.066
All right.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.633
You can hold him if you want.

22:44.767 --> 22:47.600
Just let him crawl onto
your hand.

22:47.734 --> 22:48.934
It's okay if it flies away.

22:49.066 --> 22:50.667
That's what we want him to do.

22:56.700 --> 22:57.934
Whoa!
Cool!

23:00.467 --> 23:02.567
Kids, parents,
do you want to come over

23:02.700 --> 23:04.300
and look at the show and tell?

23:13.867 --> 23:16.333
Coffee?
You're a godsend.

23:16.467 --> 23:17.800
Thank you.

23:19.767 --> 23:21.133
Hey, Amanda,

23:21.266 --> 23:22.700
do you want to take over by
yourself for a little bit?

23:22.834 --> 23:23.967
I'm on it.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.533
We're just going to be
over here.

23:25.667 --> 23:26.800
Amanda:
Okay.

23:34.166 --> 23:37.533
Well, I think she knows more
about butterflies than I do.

23:37.667 --> 23:39.400
Yeah, sorry, when she gets
excited about something,

23:39.533 --> 23:41.400
there's no stopping her.

23:41.533 --> 23:45.233
So, uh, how long have you been
doing this butterfly thing?

23:45.367 --> 23:48.667
Four years. Yeah.
It started out as a hobby,

23:48.800 --> 23:51.400
kind of a weekend thing,
and a year later,

23:51.533 --> 23:53.233
I was able to quit my day job.

23:53.367 --> 23:56.567
Mm, and what was that,
if I may ask?

23:56.700 --> 24:01.467
You may. Nothing special,
at least it didn't feel special.

24:01.600 --> 24:05.967
Corporate desk job.
Data analyst and miserable.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.233
Oh no, don't tell me you're
a data analyst.

24:10.367 --> 24:11.467
Hmm? No.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.066
What do you do for a living,
if I may ask?

24:14.200 --> 24:16.100
You may.

24:16.233 --> 24:20.767
Um, it's a bit weird, but...

24:20.900 --> 24:23.700
nothing, if I don't want to.

24:23.834 --> 24:26.266
What, did you win the lottery
or something?

24:26.400 --> 24:28.967
No. My grandfather did.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.233
He bet right on the stock market.

24:31.367 --> 24:34.200
Now my father runs one of the
largest hedge funds in New York.

24:34.333 --> 24:37.433
Wow. So what brought you
out here?

24:37.567 --> 24:40.934
Well, just after Amanda
was born,

24:41.066 --> 24:42.800
her mother passed away.

24:42.934 --> 24:44.266
I'm sorry.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.533
It's okay.

24:46.667 --> 24:49.300
Amanda never really knew her, sadly.

24:49.433 --> 24:52.266
And then after a bit of time,
I got into another relationship,

24:52.400 --> 24:53.934
we followed her up here.

24:54.066 --> 24:56.734
Ultimately things didn't
really work out.

24:56.867 --> 24:58.967
So now my father wants me to
come back to New York

24:59.100 --> 25:01.133
and take over the family reigns.

25:01.266 --> 25:04.166
Well, you don't sound very
excited about that.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.767
You know, I like working
with my hands.

25:05.900 --> 25:08.000
Working on something tangible.

25:08.133 --> 25:09.333
I don't want to work on
a ledger all day,

25:09.467 --> 25:10.633
if you know what I mean.

25:10.767 --> 25:13.333
Besides, you have to wear a tie.
I'm not a tie guy.

25:13.467 --> 25:15.000
No?

25:15.133 --> 25:16.500
No.

25:16.633 --> 25:19.266
Well, you do know that there's a
living in fixing things?

25:19.400 --> 25:21.100
Yes, just...

25:21.233 --> 25:24.467
It's just hard to pay for a big
school in New York City.

25:24.600 --> 25:27.166
So you're moving to New York,
then?

25:27.300 --> 25:28.767
Yeah, looks like it.

25:28.900 --> 25:30.467
How soon?

25:30.600 --> 25:33.333
I dunno, a couple weeks, maybe.

25:33.467 --> 25:35.767
It just depends on a few other
things, but...

25:35.900 --> 25:37.700
it's complicated.

25:39.900 --> 25:42.000
So what kinds of things are you
good at fixing?

25:42.133 --> 25:44.467
Oh, well, you name it.

25:44.600 --> 25:45.700
Mechanical?

25:45.834 --> 25:46.967
That's my specialty.

25:47.100 --> 25:49.200
Really?
Yeah.

25:49.333 --> 25:52.700
All right, well,
if you're interested,

25:52.834 --> 25:55.166
I might have some work for you
before you go.

25:55.300 --> 25:56.433
Great!

25:58.834 --> 26:00.200
Sorry, I just...

26:00.333 --> 26:01.767
Hey, Jill. Yeah.

26:01.900 --> 26:03.233
No, I'm just at a birthday party
with Amanda.

26:03.367 --> 26:04.934
No, not her birthday party.

26:05.066 --> 26:06.400
She had hers last week.
You know that, come on.

26:06.533 --> 26:07.934
Okay, look, why don't we just--

26:08.066 --> 26:10.467
we'll talk about it
when you get here, okay?

26:11.567 --> 26:12.967
Yeah.

26:18.900 --> 26:20.367
So tell me about him.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.600
Tell you about who?

26:21.734 --> 26:24.700
I told you.
A father always knows.

26:26.734 --> 26:28.734
And I can tell that there's
something that has changed

26:28.867 --> 26:30.200
inside of you.

26:31.667 --> 26:33.667
There's a light.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.433
And a bit of melancholy, too.

26:36.467 --> 26:38.667
You are good.
I'll give you that.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.600
Well, you'll have the same
intuition when you have a kid

26:40.734 --> 26:42.433
and I'm a grandfather.

26:42.567 --> 26:44.900
Is that too much to ask?

26:45.033 --> 26:48.533
Dad...
I'm sorry.

26:48.667 --> 26:51.500
I'm sorry if the pain still
sears a bit.

26:53.166 --> 26:54.867
It shouldn't.

26:56.900 --> 26:58.200
I love my life, Dad.

26:58.333 --> 27:01.800
I have a great business,
great friends.

27:01.934 --> 27:04.400
I don't need a guy
to complete me.

27:04.533 --> 27:06.200
If you say so.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.934
How am I supposed to know
when I'm ready?

27:10.066 --> 27:14.133
Nobody ever knows
if they're ready.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.767
So I'm right, aren't I?

27:16.900 --> 27:18.467
You met a guy.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.767
I thought I did.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.133
Tell me about him.

27:22.266 --> 27:26.567
It's the first time I've felt
anything since Randy.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.300
That's terrific.

27:29.433 --> 27:32.967
No, not so terrific.
I think he has a girlfriend,

27:33.100 --> 27:35.900
and he might be moving to New
York in a few weeks.

27:36.033 --> 27:37.433
Oh.

27:37.567 --> 27:42.400
Well, at least you're still open
to those kind of feelings.

27:42.533 --> 27:45.967
Well, I don't know how to trust
those feelings, Dad.

27:46.100 --> 27:47.734
I thought I was in love with
Randy, and...

27:47.867 --> 27:50.934
You were in love with Randy.

27:51.066 --> 27:53.233
You were brave.

27:53.367 --> 27:56.166
He's the one who didn't have
the courage to commit.

27:59.467 --> 28:01.300
But I got it wrong. No.

28:01.433 --> 28:04.500
You did not get it wrong.

28:04.633 --> 28:08.233
In life, we try all kinds
of things.

28:08.367 --> 28:11.133
The only time we get it wrong
is when we don't try.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.000
So what's his name?

28:17.533 --> 28:19.333
His name is Garrett.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.233
We hosted his daughter's
birthday party.

28:24.367 --> 28:27.333
There's just that... you know.

28:28.633 --> 28:30.633
Chemistry.

28:30.767 --> 28:31.867
Yeah.

28:35.700 --> 28:38.400
Now, are you sure
about the girlfriend thing?

28:38.533 --> 28:39.967
Pretty sure.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.000
And lest we forget,
he might be moving.

28:42.133 --> 28:43.834
There's that, too.

28:43.967 --> 28:46.400
Let me tell you something, sweetie.

28:46.533 --> 28:47.700
If it's meant to be,

28:47.834 --> 28:50.133
he's not going anywhere.

28:51.934 --> 28:55.967
Okay, I'll said is that I kind
of like him.

28:56.100 --> 28:58.367
I didn't say anything about it
being meant to be.

28:58.500 --> 29:02.734
Well, listen,
even if he is not Mr. Right,

29:02.867 --> 29:05.133
at least you're open to the idea

29:05.266 --> 29:08.100
that Mr. Right is out there somewhere.

29:09.700 --> 29:12.200
That's what worries me.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.934
You are so beautiful, Emily.

29:15.066 --> 29:16.867
Inside and out.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.734
And besides, you can't stay
hidden in your cocoon forever.

29:26.767 --> 29:28.066
My cocoon?

29:32.600 --> 29:35.000
Okay. Give it a try.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.433
Your bearings were burnt out.

29:40.567 --> 29:42.100
That's why it was reading the
wrong temperature.

29:42.233 --> 29:43.400
I don't know how to thank you.

29:43.533 --> 29:45.400
Just give me something else
to do.

29:45.533 --> 29:48.433
Are you kidding?
We're just getting started.

29:48.567 --> 29:49.800
Um, will these work?

29:49.934 --> 29:51.967
Perfect, come with me.

29:52.100 --> 29:54.233
So, we'll lay them
into each of these habitats,

29:54.367 --> 29:56.133
and we'll lean them against
the sides.

29:56.266 --> 29:58.100
We just want someplace for
the butterflies to perch

29:58.233 --> 29:59.600
once they emerge.
Got it.

29:59.734 --> 30:01.800
But we can do that after,
we'd better get going.

30:01.934 --> 30:04.066
Mm-hm.
Where are we going?

30:04.200 --> 30:05.433
To the woods!

30:05.567 --> 30:06.867
What's in the woods?

30:07.000 --> 30:10.567
Milkweed for the Monarchs.
Cheaper than buying it.

30:19.066 --> 30:20.900
at the stem. thp

30:21.033 --> 30:23.834
Keep the leaves whole,
Monarchs eat a lot.

30:30.533 --> 30:32.934
Uh...
It's my Dad.

30:33.066 --> 30:35.000
He's just excited about us
coming back?

30:35.133 --> 30:37.233
Well, can you tell him that
you'll still be around

30:37.367 --> 30:38.467
for this wedding?

30:38.600 --> 30:41.000
I'm going to need all the help
I can get.

30:41.133 --> 30:43.100
Maybe if I don't mention the
word "wedding."

30:43.233 --> 30:45.000
He still has high hopes for me.

30:45.133 --> 30:47.166
Oh, don't let him meet my dad.

30:47.300 --> 30:49.734
If it were up to him,
forget speed dating,

30:49.867 --> 30:51.166
it would be speed marriage.

30:51.300 --> 30:52.800
Any prospects?

30:52.934 --> 30:54.400
It's a long story.

30:56.233 --> 30:59.100
You know, honestly,
I think my Dad...

30:59.233 --> 31:01.133
he's just thinking about Amanda.

31:01.266 --> 31:03.800
He wants her to have a mother
figure in her life.

31:03.934 --> 31:05.700
Can't say that I blame him.

31:05.834 --> 31:07.400
Any prospects?

31:09.000 --> 31:10.967
It's complicated.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.967
Well, I like to think that the
world works things out

31:13.100 --> 31:15.567
the way that they're
meant to be.

31:15.700 --> 31:18.667
I like to think that, too.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.400
I was going to tell you,

31:20.533 --> 31:23.400
I'm picking up a few new
pop-ups later,

31:23.533 --> 31:25.467
and I thought Amanda
might want one.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.166
Raise a few butterflies herself.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.000
She'd love one!

31:29.133 --> 31:30.800
I'll stop by your house
on my way back.

31:30.934 --> 31:33.734
Great. Well, hey, thank you.

31:38.633 --> 31:40.600
Emily:
Well, would you look at that?

31:42.033 --> 31:44.233
You want me to try to steal the
net from Amanda?

31:45.266 --> 31:46.700
That's a Mariposa.

31:46.834 --> 31:48.567
A Mariposa?

31:48.700 --> 31:50.300
Spanish for butterfly.

31:50.433 --> 31:52.066
That's your last name.

31:52.200 --> 31:54.166
Funny how the world works
things out.

32:19.767 --> 32:20.900
Hi.
Hi!

32:21.033 --> 32:22.633
Is this a good time?

32:22.767 --> 32:24.100
It is if you want to eat.

32:24.233 --> 32:25.533
No, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

32:25.667 --> 32:26.934
No, come on. Come, come.

32:27.066 --> 32:28.767
And thanks for bringing the
pop-up for Amanda.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.734
She doesn't get excited about
a lot of things,

32:30.867 --> 32:32.934
there's not a lot of friends,
but with your help,

32:33.066 --> 32:36.467
she's starting to emerge,
shall we say?

32:36.600 --> 32:37.767
Come on.

32:37.900 --> 32:39.333
Uh, okay.

32:41.667 --> 32:43.800
That was delicious.

32:43.934 --> 32:46.133
Don't try his meatloaf.

32:46.266 --> 32:47.967
Hey.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.200
So what's next for
this little one?

32:50.333 --> 32:53.700
For starters, we need to double
the size of our Flight House.

32:53.834 --> 32:55.133
I can get the permits,

32:55.266 --> 32:56.934
but I need to find someone
who can build it.

32:57.066 --> 33:00.200
Pronto.
I'm your man.

33:00.333 --> 33:04.967
I hope so.

33:05.100 --> 33:08.100
Are you sure?
We're in a bit of a rush.

33:08.233 --> 33:11.300
I'll tell you what,
I'll clear my busy schedule.

33:11.433 --> 33:14.533
Well, thank you. We'll start
planning it tomorrow.

33:16.500 --> 33:17.734
Oh, excuse me.

33:18.900 --> 33:20.667
Thanks for the pop-up,
I'm so excited.

33:20.800 --> 33:23.600
Aw, you are so welcome.
You're the best assistant.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.333
Surprise!

33:26.467 --> 33:28.967
Jill? I thought you weren't
coming until next week.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.533
I was able to change my schedule.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.300
I wasn't expecting you.

33:35.934 --> 33:37.734
I missed you.
Uh, I--

33:39.166 --> 33:40.834
Jill:
Where's Amanda?

33:40.967 --> 33:42.900
Garrett:
Oh, she's-- she's in there.

33:44.934 --> 33:46.133
Jill!

33:46.266 --> 33:48.100
Hey, sweetie.
Come here.

33:50.133 --> 33:52.200
I want to show you this really
cool pop-up.

33:52.333 --> 33:56.300
First, I got this beautiful gift
all the way from Portugal.

33:56.433 --> 33:58.433
It's called a balance necklace.

33:58.567 --> 34:00.333
It's a reminder
that the perfect life

34:00.467 --> 34:02.200
is built on the goal of balance.

34:02.333 --> 34:06.300
And it's a reminder
that you are loved.

34:09.333 --> 34:10.934
Don't you think it's pretty?

34:12.367 --> 34:16.033
Yeah, it just... sparkles.

34:16.166 --> 34:18.567
Um, who is this?

34:18.700 --> 34:21.166
This is Emily.
Emily is--

34:21.300 --> 34:24.233
Just leaving.
Nice to meet you.

34:24.367 --> 34:26.567
Jill:
It was nice to meet you, too.

34:26.700 --> 34:29.667
Um, excuse me for a minute.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.700
Emily, wait, I can explain.

34:31.834 --> 34:33.433
It's none of my business.

34:33.567 --> 34:36.066
She's--
It's fine.

34:36.200 --> 34:38.600
I'll talk to you tomorrow,
and thanks again for dinner.

35:20.266 --> 35:21.800
Where are we meeting her?

35:21.934 --> 35:23.333
18th hole.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.000
Rebecca:
You're not listening!

35:27.133 --> 35:29.066
The putter!
It's literally right there!

35:29.200 --> 35:30.600
You're not--
I don't want that!

35:30.734 --> 35:32.533
No! That one below.

35:37.266 --> 35:38.900
Is that her?

35:39.033 --> 35:41.000
That's her.

35:55.900 --> 35:57.000
Okay.

35:57.133 --> 35:58.367
Man: Fore!

36:03.333 --> 36:05.033
Obviously the best place
to have my wedding

36:05.166 --> 36:06.500
is the O'Keefe golf course.

36:06.633 --> 36:08.700
My great-grandfather built it
in 1933.

36:08.834 --> 36:12.200
The sun will be there,
no longer in anyone's eyes.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.734
Mandy:
So smart.

36:16.767 --> 36:18.066
This is where the vows will be.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.500
Wow, it's pretty here.

36:19.633 --> 36:22.000
Yeah, I like to keep it
conservation-y.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.633
The vows will take 17 minutes.

36:25.767 --> 36:26.867
I want the butterflies
to be released

36:27.000 --> 36:28.800
exactly when we kiss
behind us here.

36:28.934 --> 36:31.166
Not a problem at all.

36:31.300 --> 36:33.867
And you'll need some kind
of barrier.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.333
Why?

36:35.467 --> 36:38.166
Well, you don't want your guests
looking at me.

36:38.300 --> 36:39.967
And it's supposed to feel like
the butterflies

36:40.100 --> 36:42.800
have sprung from nature.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.734
Well, what kind of barrier?

36:44.867 --> 36:47.166
Shrubbery, and a few trees.

36:47.300 --> 36:49.900
How is a tree going to grow in
time for the wedding?

36:52.533 --> 36:55.000
No, we can bring something in.

36:55.133 --> 36:57.467
We do it all the time.
A simple hedge will do.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.467
Actually, I can decorate--

36:59.600 --> 37:00.900
Mandy: You know, my team can decorate

37:01.033 --> 37:03.867
to match all of the flowers,
and all of the colours.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.533
Mandy, that's a terrific idea.

37:06.667 --> 37:08.133
Mandy:
Thank you.

37:08.266 --> 37:09.967
So how many butterflies
can I expect?

37:10.100 --> 37:12.100
At least 500, guaranteed.

37:12.233 --> 37:14.533
I can get you 600.
I can get you 1,000.

37:14.667 --> 37:16.867
That's impossible,
and you know it.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.467
I don't believe in impossible.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.400
God never said it was impossible
to create the butterfly,

37:23.533 --> 37:27.233
and he did, so...

37:27.367 --> 37:29.200
You'll both have to let me know
the day before

37:29.333 --> 37:30.700
and I'll make my decision.

37:30.834 --> 37:32.133
They day before?

37:33.166 --> 37:34.467
Is that a problem?

37:34.600 --> 37:36.033
Well...

37:36.166 --> 37:40.066
It's just that I'll be investing
a lot of time and money, and...

37:40.200 --> 37:44.567
See, that's not my problem.
You're free to bow out.

37:45.734 --> 37:47.200
Now this is very important.

37:47.333 --> 37:49.533
I want the butterflies to circle
over the two of us

37:49.667 --> 37:51.367
before they fly away.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.467
It doesn't really work
like that.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.467
Well, can't butterflies be
trained?

37:56.600 --> 37:58.266
No.
You know what?

37:58.400 --> 37:59.767
I'm gonna look into a
butterfly wrangler

37:59.900 --> 38:01.367
and get right back to you
on that.

38:01.500 --> 38:02.867
Oh, come on!

38:03.000 --> 38:06.867
See, Emily? Can you at least try
before you dismiss the idea?

38:07.000 --> 38:09.934
Yeah, Emily, can you just try?

38:17.033 --> 38:19.166
I've been wanting to expand for
a while.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.867
This is great.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.500
Well, this is our expansion
project?

39:22.400 --> 39:23.734
Son of a bee sting!
Are you okay?

39:25.233 --> 39:27.066
Let me see. Let me see.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.000
I think we're done for today.

39:47.367 --> 39:49.500
There you go.
Don't worry, it's decaf.

39:49.633 --> 39:51.900
Ow!
Oh...

39:52.033 --> 39:53.400
How's the thumb?

39:53.533 --> 39:55.300
It-- I'll live.

39:55.433 --> 39:58.066
I just hope it doesn't detract
from a job well done.

39:58.200 --> 40:02.767
Are you kidding?
This is going to be amazing.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.800
Beyond just our business,

40:04.934 --> 40:07.166
this will be a real butterfly sanctuary.

40:07.300 --> 40:09.834
Well, it was always my dream to
save the butterflies.

40:13.433 --> 40:15.100
So, um...

40:15.233 --> 40:16.900
When will the caterpillars
be ready?

40:17.033 --> 40:18.433
Three days.

40:19.600 --> 40:22.066
And what's the word on
Mandy Fischer?

40:22.200 --> 40:25.600
Well, she's been after
the same vendors.

40:25.734 --> 40:28.000
But inside sources tell me

40:28.133 --> 40:30.667
that she doesn't have
the same numbers.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.800
You know, is it--
is it really worth all this

40:35.934 --> 40:38.166
if Rebecca just ends up picking
Mandy in the end?

40:38.300 --> 40:42.667
Okay, well, A, I'm not going to
lose to Mandy Fischer.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.133
Wait, sorry, what--

40:45.266 --> 40:46.433
what is your deal with her?

40:46.567 --> 40:50.433
It seems like it's just a
business to her.

40:51.467 --> 40:55.300
She does kitten parties,
puppies too.

40:55.433 --> 40:58.767
Butterflies are just a number.

40:58.900 --> 41:00.967
And I have a connection to butterflies

41:01.100 --> 41:02.900
and their place in this world.

41:03.033 --> 41:05.734
And I like to teach people
the importance of that.

41:05.867 --> 41:09.867
Okay, so don't lose to
Mandy Fischer.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.500
And B?

41:12.967 --> 41:14.633
B...

41:14.767 --> 41:17.767
Yes, it's been worth it.

41:19.633 --> 41:21.567
Yeah, it has.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.533
Okay, I'm sorry.

41:27.667 --> 41:28.834
I don't get it.

41:28.967 --> 41:31.200
I feel like there's this...

41:31.333 --> 41:33.800
this thing here.

41:33.934 --> 41:35.667
There's a thing?

41:35.800 --> 41:37.867
Well, us.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.633
There, that look?

41:39.767 --> 41:42.633
That's not how someone typically
looks at me,

41:42.767 --> 41:44.900
and that's not how, typically,
I look at someone.

41:45.934 --> 41:47.800
Yeah, me either.

41:48.834 --> 41:50.533
There, you--
you just did it again.

41:50.667 --> 41:53.467
I'm sorry, I don't know how
I'm looking at you.

41:57.633 --> 42:00.633
No, I don't want you to be
sorry, I just...

42:00.767 --> 42:02.367
I don't get it.

42:04.100 --> 42:05.367
Jill.

42:05.500 --> 42:08.767
Yes. Jill.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.600
I told you, it's complicated.

42:13.734 --> 42:17.800
Well, I'm not complicated, Garrett.

42:17.934 --> 42:21.533
You either have a girlfriend
or you don't.

42:21.667 --> 42:22.767
I don't.

42:22.900 --> 42:25.867
You kissed her.
She kissed me.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.567
And you know,
just for the record,

42:27.700 --> 42:30.600
she's not staying at my house.
Jill is my ex-girlfriend.

42:30.734 --> 42:33.467
She's always been a big part
of Amanda's life.

42:33.600 --> 42:37.400
We stayed friends,
and probably always be friends.

42:39.433 --> 42:41.567
So what happened?

42:41.700 --> 42:43.867
Well,

42:44.000 --> 42:47.266
she works for the state department,

42:47.400 --> 42:50.533
and she was assigned overseas.

42:50.667 --> 42:54.467
She was there for a few months,
and we just...

42:54.600 --> 42:57.400
We kinda lost our way.

42:57.533 --> 43:01.600
And what, she's found it again?

43:01.734 --> 43:03.600
Yeah, yeah, she has.

43:03.734 --> 43:05.867
She's stationed back
in New York.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.266
Which is part of the reason why
my dad wants me to go back,

43:08.400 --> 43:10.200
because he is all for this reconciliation.

43:10.333 --> 43:11.533
And you?

43:11.667 --> 43:14.934
Jill and I have this history.
Amanda adores her,

43:15.066 --> 43:17.000
she's a great role model
for Amanda.

43:17.133 --> 43:19.033
I think Jill is curious to see

43:19.166 --> 43:21.333
if there's something
still there.

43:21.467 --> 43:23.166
Is there?

43:23.300 --> 43:25.100
I don't know.

43:25.233 --> 43:27.166
And you know, I think that's
what's bothering me,

43:27.300 --> 43:31.467
because I feel like I should.

43:31.600 --> 43:34.300
It's a lame answer, I know.
I'm sorry.

43:34.433 --> 43:37.100
No, it's an honest answer.

43:37.233 --> 43:39.600
Honestly, yeah,
I wanted to give it a try.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.500
Until...

43:42.633 --> 43:45.033
Until what?

43:45.166 --> 43:46.633
Until the unexpected.

43:50.233 --> 43:54.000
And, um... you know,

43:54.133 --> 43:57.100
I realize that Jill and I...

43:57.233 --> 43:59.533
weren't always compatible.

43:59.667 --> 44:02.100
She doesn't really appreciate
a guy who gets his hands dirty.

44:03.900 --> 44:07.233
You know what's funny is my grandfather,

44:07.367 --> 44:09.700
he wasn't a businessman.

44:09.834 --> 44:13.900
He just got lucky on
some stocks.

44:14.033 --> 44:16.567
But before that,
he was a carpenter.

44:16.700 --> 44:20.100
He could build anything,
fix anything,

44:20.233 --> 44:22.734
that was his trade.

44:22.867 --> 44:24.600
It was until the day
that he died.

44:24.734 --> 44:27.600
It's in your blood.

44:27.734 --> 44:31.200
Well, it might skip a generation

44:31.333 --> 44:34.266
but it's in there.

44:34.400 --> 44:37.333
Did you know that the Monarch butterfly

44:37.467 --> 44:40.333
migrates down to Mexico
each year?

44:40.467 --> 44:42.533
That's where they lay
their eggs,

44:42.667 --> 44:45.033
and then they migrate back here.

44:45.166 --> 44:49.133
The entire cycle takes three
generations, sometimes five.

44:51.033 --> 44:52.667
I didn't know that.

44:54.300 --> 44:58.100
Each generation relies on the
next to carry its legacy.

45:44.734 --> 45:46.100
What a day.

45:46.233 --> 45:47.567
I got in the three orders we needed.

45:47.700 --> 45:49.567
I'm calling two other places tomorrow.

45:49.700 --> 45:51.600
If Taylor Brothers comes through,

45:51.734 --> 45:53.000
we should be covered.

45:53.133 --> 45:55.734
Only thing I'm worried about
is the timing.

45:57.767 --> 46:00.300
You didn't hear a word I said.

46:00.433 --> 46:01.967
Sorry.

46:02.100 --> 46:04.033
What's going on?

46:05.500 --> 46:07.367
It's what I thought.

46:07.500 --> 46:10.066
Ex-girlfriend.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.467
Long history.
Back in the picture.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.533
Get out.

46:15.667 --> 46:16.900
I don't get it.

46:17.033 --> 46:19.133
The guy has a total crush
on you.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.166
It's complicated.

46:24.700 --> 46:26.000
Please.

46:26.133 --> 46:28.667
No, by definition, it's true.

46:28.800 --> 46:30.734
He doesn't know what he wants.

46:30.867 --> 46:32.667
That's because he's a guy.

46:32.800 --> 46:35.834
No, it's because he's confused.

46:35.967 --> 46:37.667
So un-confuse him.

46:37.800 --> 46:41.066
I don't even know what I want.

46:41.200 --> 46:45.667
Maybe I'm just feeling
stupidly rejected.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.734
I hardly know him.

46:49.333 --> 46:52.834
Well, how do you feel when
you're around him?

46:55.867 --> 46:59.667
Like I have butterflies
in my stomach.

47:01.100 --> 47:04.533
Adam:
Then don't let him flutter away.

47:04.667 --> 47:06.066
See you tomorrow.

47:09.700 --> 47:11.300
You're the best, Adam.

47:12.333 --> 47:13.800
Working on it.

47:31.667 --> 47:33.467
Morning!

47:33.600 --> 47:34.800
Morning.

47:36.033 --> 47:37.467
Still like it with cream
and cinnamon?

47:37.600 --> 47:40.233
Garrett:
Yeah, that's perfect.

47:40.367 --> 47:42.767
See, it's like we've hardly
been apart.

47:43.800 --> 47:45.333
Hardly.

47:45.467 --> 47:46.700
Have you started packing?

47:46.834 --> 47:49.200
I've been a little busy.

47:49.333 --> 47:50.667
Doing what?

47:50.800 --> 47:54.200
Well, you know,
I work for a living here, Jill.

47:54.333 --> 47:56.400
But it's more of a hobby,
though, isn't it?

47:56.533 --> 47:59.000
Your father is going to set you
up with a real career.

48:00.700 --> 48:02.100
What's going on?

48:02.233 --> 48:04.433
This is not fair.

48:04.567 --> 48:06.867
It's not fair that you just come
back into my life

48:07.000 --> 48:10.567
like it hasn't been two years.
Like I haven't moved on.

48:10.700 --> 48:13.400
It's not like we haven't seen
each other in those two years.

48:13.533 --> 48:14.900
You're right.

48:16.233 --> 48:18.300
The butterfly lady?

48:18.433 --> 48:19.867
How long has that been going on?

48:20.000 --> 48:23.700
No, nothing is going on.
I hardly know her.

48:23.834 --> 48:26.734
Well then let's not throw away
all the time we had together.

48:26.867 --> 48:29.133
We had something really special.

48:29.266 --> 48:30.800
Had, Jill.

48:30.934 --> 48:34.100
We had something really special.
That's the key word.

48:34.233 --> 48:35.734
I have some news.

48:35.867 --> 48:37.967
I spoke to Amy Pritchard
at Breck Academy,

48:38.100 --> 48:41.700
my alma mater, and sent in
an application for Amanda.

48:41.834 --> 48:43.033
What?

48:43.166 --> 48:44.200
I know I should have asked,

48:44.333 --> 48:45.867
but I didn't
want you to say no.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.066
No, you should have discussed
this with me.

48:48.200 --> 48:49.800
I wanted it to be a surprise.

48:49.934 --> 48:52.200
It's the best school in
New York, Garrett.

48:52.333 --> 48:54.133
All the money in the world
can't get you in.

48:54.266 --> 48:55.800
It's gonna take all the money in
the world to pay for it!

48:55.934 --> 48:57.600
Which is why taking over your
father's company

48:57.734 --> 49:00.467
is so important.
Think about Amanda,

49:00.600 --> 49:03.300
and what this would mean
for her future.

49:03.433 --> 49:04.834
Daddy! Look!

49:04.967 --> 49:07.600
I found a caterpillar from the
pop-up that Emily gave me!

49:07.734 --> 49:08.867
That's great!

49:09.000 --> 49:10.600
Do you want to come
and see it too, Jill?

49:10.734 --> 49:15.100
Sure, sweetie. Let's see.

49:15.233 --> 49:17.433
Wow! That is so cool!

49:17.567 --> 49:19.500
Thanks!
I'm so proud of you.

49:19.633 --> 49:21.166
Amanda: Thank you.
Jill: Come here.

49:21.300 --> 49:23.033
Aww.

49:23.166 --> 49:26.333
Listen, I've gotta run,
but we'll talk later, okay?

49:26.467 --> 49:28.000
Okay.

49:28.133 --> 49:29.300
Bye, sweetie.

49:29.433 --> 49:30.767
Bye, Jill.

49:35.500 --> 49:37.934
Hey! Looking good.

49:38.066 --> 49:39.467
I'll clean all this up later,
you know,

49:39.600 --> 49:41.934
I'll put down some sod.
How are the orders coming?

49:42.066 --> 49:44.834
We're all set.
Just a matter of logistics now.

49:44.967 --> 49:47.367
I think we're actually going
to pull this off.

49:47.500 --> 49:50.700
Eat your heart out,
Mandy Fischer.

49:50.834 --> 49:54.433
Hey, you've got something
on your--

49:54.567 --> 49:56.033
Just up on your--

49:56.166 --> 49:57.633
On my face?

49:57.767 --> 49:58.967
Up here?

49:59.100 --> 50:01.667
Yeah. A little bit down.

50:01.800 --> 50:04.800
Just like, here? I--

50:04.934 --> 50:06.934
Here, I'll--
Oh yeah?

50:07.066 --> 50:08.166
Let me help you.
No, no, no, no!

50:08.300 --> 50:09.467
Why not?

50:09.600 --> 50:11.033
I'm just helping you!
Don't!

50:11.166 --> 50:12.300
Don't you dare.

50:12.433 --> 50:14.767
Okay, okay. Fine.

50:15.800 --> 50:17.200
Peace.

50:21.233 --> 50:23.633
Oh!

50:23.767 --> 50:25.000
Okay, now I'm--

50:26.400 --> 50:27.800
Oh no!
Are you okay?

50:27.934 --> 50:29.300
Okay, I surrender.
I surrender.

50:29.433 --> 50:32.100
White flag.

50:35.734 --> 50:36.834
Emily: No...

50:36.967 --> 50:38.100
That's not a new shirt, is it?

50:38.233 --> 50:39.633
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

50:39.767 --> 50:40.867
Oh yeah?
Yeah.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.133
If you can catch me!

50:42.266 --> 50:43.367
You better run!

50:58.800 --> 51:01.200
Hey, you've got something
on your face.

51:06.066 --> 51:09.000
Look at that. It's a dragon.

51:09.133 --> 51:12.500
You can see the head
and the tail and the wings.

51:13.533 --> 51:15.000
That's an elephant.

51:19.633 --> 51:21.700
Oh yeah. It's an elephant.

51:21.834 --> 51:24.600
That one right there?

51:24.734 --> 51:25.867
A butterfly.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.066
Everything is a butterfly
with you.

51:37.500 --> 51:40.200
Any decisions yet?

51:40.333 --> 51:43.333
I just have to think what's best
for Amanda.

51:43.467 --> 51:46.066
Whatever makes her happy.

51:46.200 --> 51:48.333
I don't even think she knows
what makes her happy.

51:50.367 --> 51:51.834
Do you?

52:04.467 --> 52:05.867
Whoa

52:07.066 --> 52:08.233
What?

52:08.367 --> 52:09.834
Adam:
Nothing, you look great.

52:09.967 --> 52:11.934
This is bound to turn his head.

52:12.066 --> 52:16.567
Oh please, this is not an
attempt to change his mind.

52:16.700 --> 52:19.166
Will you just tell him how you
feel already?

52:19.300 --> 52:21.166
Yeah, that would be a little obvious.

52:21.300 --> 52:23.166
At least you'll know.

52:34.867 --> 52:36.100
What?

52:36.233 --> 52:38.834
He's not supposed to come until
this afternoon.

52:46.100 --> 52:47.900
Rebecca.

52:48.033 --> 52:50.834
I've called you three times.
We need to talk.

52:54.700 --> 52:58.834
Emily: Uh, well, I didn't get
any messages.

52:58.967 --> 53:01.867
Mandy Fischer answers on the
first ring.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.734
You must be Adam.

53:03.867 --> 53:06.300
I am, nice to meet you.

53:06.433 --> 53:08.967
We have a problem.
What problem?

53:09.100 --> 53:10.800
Christi Cameron.

53:10.934 --> 53:12.567
I'm not following.

53:12.700 --> 53:15.300
Best friend.
Was best friend.

53:15.433 --> 53:17.900
She released 1,500 butterflies
at a charity event

53:18.033 --> 53:19.567
in New York last week.

53:19.700 --> 53:22.467
Mandy Fischer says she can
deliver 1,501.

53:22.600 --> 53:24.467
But I get the impression Mandy
Fischer just says

53:24.600 --> 53:26.000
whatever I want to hear.

53:26.133 --> 53:27.967
I will not let
Christi Cameron best me.

53:28.100 --> 53:30.567
Can you do it? Say yes now
and the job is yours.

53:30.700 --> 53:32.567
Yes.

53:32.700 --> 53:36.233
Uh, all we can promise is our
best effort, Rebecca.

53:36.367 --> 53:39.233
I know two vendors that might
be able to help,

53:39.367 --> 53:41.900
but it's a long shot, so...

53:42.033 --> 53:43.767
But that's a yes, right?

53:45.800 --> 53:47.867
You'll be on the cover of
Wedding Weekly.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.033
Okay, yes.

53:50.166 --> 53:53.567
I knew it.
And don't forget, 1,501.

54:03.934 --> 54:06.333
You look really nice today,
by the way.

54:07.934 --> 54:09.133
Thank you.

54:09.266 --> 54:12.233
Remind me to set you up
with someone at the wedding.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.266
Congratulations!

54:19.400 --> 54:21.367
You know I'm not out
of the woods yet.

54:25.100 --> 54:28.266
You know, I could-- I could go
get the caterpillars for you.

54:28.400 --> 54:31.533
Thank you.

54:31.667 --> 54:33.867
Thank you, but I--
I have to do it.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.700
I need to inspect them and make
sure the count is right.

54:36.834 --> 54:39.533
Well, how are you planning
on being in two places at once?

54:39.667 --> 54:42.900
Magic. An act of God? I...

54:43.033 --> 54:45.433
I haven't figured it out yet.

54:45.567 --> 54:48.967
You know, um, Amanda and I,

54:49.100 --> 54:51.233
we could do one of the parties.

54:51.367 --> 54:52.900
I hadn't thought of that.

54:53.033 --> 54:54.767
Well, Adam is doing the
retirement party,

54:54.900 --> 54:57.633
and the other one is a birthday
party, just a small one?

54:57.767 --> 55:00.667
A couple dozen butterflies?
We could handle that.

55:00.800 --> 55:02.300
Are you sure?
Absolutely.

55:02.433 --> 55:04.700
I mean, Amanda's been trained by
the best, right?

55:04.834 --> 55:06.467
Thank you. Thanks.

55:06.600 --> 55:08.200
Okay. Sure!

55:08.333 --> 55:10.934
What am I going to do
without you?

55:11.066 --> 55:13.967
I just mean, after this,

55:14.100 --> 55:15.767
we're going to hit the big time,

55:15.900 --> 55:18.367
and, well, you'll be missed.

55:19.567 --> 55:20.967
Will I?

55:36.900 --> 55:38.233
Hi, Emily, how are you?

55:38.367 --> 55:40.800
Panicked as usual, Taylor.
Thank you.

55:40.934 --> 55:42.166
I wanted to tell you,

55:42.300 --> 55:44.133
there's a clean survival rate
on the larva.

55:44.266 --> 55:46.100
This is a good crop of caterpillars.

55:46.233 --> 55:48.233
Great. What ratio do you think
we can expect?

55:48.367 --> 55:49.467
80-20.

55:49.600 --> 55:51.100
That'll do!

55:51.233 --> 55:53.567
However, the OE has begun
to spread again.

55:53.700 --> 55:57.100
A nasty little parasite
wiping out a lot of Monarchs.

55:57.233 --> 55:59.500
But it hasn't reached this
far yet, has it?

55:59.633 --> 56:01.500
All it takes is one bad apple.

56:01.633 --> 56:03.367
That's why we're shutting down
for a week.

56:03.500 --> 56:04.667
Be extra careful.

56:04.800 --> 56:06.300
We will.

56:06.433 --> 56:08.000
Come on, I've got four crates
waiting for you.

56:08.133 --> 56:09.333
Let's get them loaded up.

56:09.467 --> 56:10.834
Thanks, Taylor.

56:19.100 --> 56:21.800
Hey! How'd it go?
It went great!

56:21.934 --> 56:24.800
All of the butterflies flew away
like they were supposed to,

56:24.934 --> 56:27.533
and one even landed on one of
the kids' noses.

56:27.667 --> 56:29.667
Really?!

56:29.800 --> 56:31.033
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear.

56:31.166 --> 56:32.300
Yeah, I was hardly needed.

56:32.433 --> 56:34.333
I'm not surprised.

56:34.467 --> 56:37.700
The girl's mother already texted
me and said you both were great.

56:37.834 --> 56:40.367
And thank you for the updates,
it eased my mind.

56:40.500 --> 56:42.166
How'd it go?
Well...

56:46.200 --> 56:47.734
They're all here.

56:47.867 --> 56:49.033
Amanda, do you want to help me

56:49.166 --> 56:50.533
set the caterpillars into
their new homes?

56:50.667 --> 56:52.166
Yeah.
Okay.

56:52.300 --> 56:54.300
You take this one,
I'll follow you in.

56:54.433 --> 56:55.967
Why don't you guys get started?
I'll grab the rest.

56:56.100 --> 56:57.333
Thanks.

57:04.333 --> 57:05.633
What are you doing?

57:05.767 --> 57:06.900
This is my friend.

57:07.033 --> 57:09.700
Oh! Does your friend
have a name?

57:09.834 --> 57:11.066
Sarah.

57:11.200 --> 57:13.734
That's a pretty name.
How did you come up with that?

57:13.867 --> 57:15.734
Well, my mom's name was Sarah.

57:15.867 --> 57:17.233
Oh.

57:20.700 --> 57:22.233
I found her in the woods,

57:22.367 --> 57:24.233
that's why she's in this
little habitat.

57:24.367 --> 57:26.100
Daddy said that Mommy loved butterflies.

57:26.233 --> 57:27.533
Really?

57:27.667 --> 57:30.800
Yeah, I guess that's why
I like them so much.

57:30.934 --> 57:32.200
I'm sure that's why.

57:32.333 --> 57:35.200
You know, I'm kinda sad
that she's not here to help us.

57:35.333 --> 57:36.967
I think that she really would
have liked it.

57:37.100 --> 57:40.600
Well, you know what I believe?

57:40.734 --> 57:42.867
I believe that she's here
right now.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.233
Just in ways that we can't see.

57:45.367 --> 57:47.433
You mean like an angel?
Mm-hm.

57:47.567 --> 57:49.734
Do you think it's possible
for humans

57:49.867 --> 57:51.700
to grow wings when they
go to heaven?

57:51.834 --> 57:54.600
Well, I don't know if they grow
wings exactly,

57:54.734 --> 57:56.867
but we have to get there somehow.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.467
Do you think a caterpillar knows
that one day,

57:59.600 --> 58:02.300
it will grow wings and fly?

58:02.433 --> 58:04.767
That would seem pretty
impossible, wouldn't it?

58:04.900 --> 58:06.633
I guess so.

58:06.767 --> 58:09.433
Well, this world we're in,

58:09.567 --> 58:12.100
we think it's so big
and amazing.

58:12.233 --> 58:14.633
Just like a caterpillar sees it.

58:16.667 --> 58:19.333
But then it changes into something

58:19.467 --> 58:22.166
so beautiful and wondrous

58:22.300 --> 58:24.934
that it can't even imagine the
way it was before.

58:25.066 --> 58:27.467
Yeah.

58:27.600 --> 58:29.166
Trust me.

58:29.300 --> 58:32.433
Your mom is watching over you.

58:32.567 --> 58:35.300
And she must be very proud.

58:35.433 --> 58:36.700
And I'll tell you what.

58:36.834 --> 58:38.967
We'll keep a special eye
on Sarah here,

58:39.100 --> 58:41.667
and when she decides
it's her time,

58:41.800 --> 58:43.433
we can watch her fly away together.

58:43.567 --> 58:45.100
Deal?
Deal.

58:45.233 --> 58:46.600
Okay.

58:51.066 --> 58:53.934
So why don't you do this
the day before?

58:54.066 --> 58:56.166
You know you're going to have to
water these every day.

58:56.300 --> 59:00.200
Rebecca insisted.
She leaves nothing to chance.

59:00.333 --> 59:04.033
She even got flowers that will
bloom in exactly seven days,

59:04.166 --> 59:06.734
eight hours, and 47 minutes,

59:06.867 --> 59:08.266
just as they're saying
their vows.

59:08.400 --> 59:09.567
You're kidding.

59:09.700 --> 59:11.166
I kid not.

59:11.300 --> 59:13.734
Well then, you better hope
1,500 butterflies

59:13.867 --> 59:16.066
show themselves to the world
when they're supposed to.

59:16.200 --> 59:18.433
1,501.

59:18.567 --> 59:22.066
Well, that's looking
pretty good.

59:22.200 --> 59:25.734
We'll never be able to see the
man behind the curtain.

59:25.867 --> 59:29.200
Thanks for helping.
Can I buy you lunch?

59:29.333 --> 59:32.166
Well, a wise man once said,

59:32.300 --> 59:34.100
never turn down a free lunch.

59:50.233 --> 59:53.000
So what do you think?

59:53.133 --> 59:55.166
Gourmet burgers in a place
like this?

59:55.300 --> 59:57.033
How can you beat it?

59:57.166 --> 59:58.934
I don't think you can.

59:59.066 --> 1:00:00.600
How'd you find this place,
anyways?

1:00:01.834 --> 1:00:03.266
I got engaged here.

1:00:03.400 --> 1:00:05.000
You're engaged?

1:00:05.133 --> 1:00:06.700
Up until a year ago.

1:00:06.834 --> 1:00:09.166
But this is where he proposed.

1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:13.400
Do you mind if I ask
what happened?

1:00:13.533 --> 1:00:15.500
We were together
for a few years,

1:00:15.633 --> 1:00:18.667
and happy, I thought.

1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:22.567
He proposed, I said yes, and...

1:00:22.700 --> 1:00:25.033
He changed his mind.

1:00:25.166 --> 1:00:26.867
I'm sorry.

1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.967
I'm surprised I didn't think of
that before I brought you here.

1:00:32.900 --> 1:00:36.000
Maybe that's because it just
doesn't matter anymore.

1:00:36.133 --> 1:00:37.533
That's why you didn't
think about it.

1:00:37.667 --> 1:00:39.867
So it doesn't have to
take away from...

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:41.600
from all of this.

1:00:43.066 --> 1:00:45.433
Yeah. You're right.

1:00:45.567 --> 1:00:48.100
You know, I feel like I'm
seeing this place

1:00:48.233 --> 1:00:50.033
in a whole new light.

1:01:07.233 --> 1:01:09.133
Great.

1:01:09.266 --> 1:01:10.900
What? Who is it?

1:01:11.033 --> 1:01:13.767
Oh, that's my Dad's car.

1:01:13.900 --> 1:01:15.266
What, it's a bad thing?

1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:19.000
No, I love my Dad, but sometimes
he has no boundaries.

1:01:19.133 --> 1:01:20.667
He's taking a baking class,

1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:23.900
and he just shows up
assuming I want to bake.

1:01:24.033 --> 1:01:25.767
Baking class?
Yeah.

1:01:25.900 --> 1:01:28.600
Apparently a great spot to meet
women his age.

1:01:28.734 --> 1:01:30.600
Would you come in and meet him,

1:01:30.734 --> 1:01:33.100
or else I'll never hear
the end of it.

1:01:33.233 --> 1:01:34.633
I don't want to intrude.

1:01:34.767 --> 1:01:36.266
Especially during baking time.

1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:39.000
Trust me, it will be
another favour.

1:01:45.367 --> 1:01:46.600
Hello.

1:01:46.734 --> 1:01:47.900
You didn't answer your
text messages.

1:01:48.033 --> 1:01:49.133
Uh, my phone died.

1:01:49.266 --> 1:01:51.066
Nonsense.

1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:52.600
What are we into for today, Dad?

1:01:52.734 --> 1:01:54.166
Cookies.

1:01:54.300 --> 1:01:55.767
Chocolate marble.

1:01:55.900 --> 1:01:57.467
Sounds great. Dad, this is--

1:01:57.600 --> 1:01:59.066
So this is him.

1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:01.033
Garrett.
Nice to finally meet you.

1:02:01.166 --> 1:02:02.400
Nice to meet you, Mr. Mar--

1:02:02.533 --> 1:02:04.800
Larry. Call me Larry.

1:02:04.934 --> 1:02:07.367
Larry.

1:02:07.500 --> 1:02:08.800
I can see why you have such a
crush on him.

1:02:08.934 --> 1:02:10.233
Dad!

1:02:10.367 --> 1:02:11.734
Yeah, she talks about you all
the time.

1:02:11.867 --> 1:02:12.800
She goes on and on about you.

1:02:12.934 --> 1:02:14.133
She does?
Yeah.

1:02:14.266 --> 1:02:15.667
No, really, I haven't.

1:02:15.800 --> 1:02:16.967
Did she tell you
that her fiancé left her

1:02:17.100 --> 1:02:19.066
standing at the altar last year?

1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:21.000
No.
Dad!

1:02:21.133 --> 1:02:23.400
Listen, that saying,
"Once bitten, twice shy?"

1:02:23.533 --> 1:02:25.333
Thrice, is that a word?
'Cause if it is, it's her.

1:02:25.467 --> 1:02:26.967
Okay, stop. Now.

1:02:27.100 --> 1:02:29.000
Oh, she thinks
I'm embarrassing her.

1:02:29.133 --> 1:02:31.133
You are embarrassing me!

1:02:31.266 --> 1:02:34.166
Don't you think
she's absolutely lovely?

1:02:34.300 --> 1:02:36.133
I do.

1:02:36.266 --> 1:02:37.400
You do?

1:02:37.533 --> 1:02:38.900
Then why haven't you
told her yet?

1:02:39.033 --> 1:02:42.367
It's complicated.
Oh, yes, so I've heard.

1:02:42.500 --> 1:02:44.400
Dad, your cookies are burning!

1:02:44.533 --> 1:02:46.400
Nice try. They're not in
the oven yet.

1:02:46.533 --> 1:02:51.200
Listen, things are only
complicated until they're not.

1:02:52.667 --> 1:02:54.333
Oh, excuse me.

1:02:54.467 --> 1:02:56.266
Phone snakes!
Play nice.

1:02:57.867 --> 1:02:59.667
I've got all kinds of stories
that I can tell you

1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:01.600
about my little baby.

1:03:01.734 --> 1:03:02.900
Hello?

1:03:03.033 --> 1:03:05.467
Emily, we're in trouble.
Get here now.

1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:07.233
Yeah, I'll be right there.

1:03:08.867 --> 1:03:10.367
We've gotta go.

1:03:33.266 --> 1:03:34.967
We lost almost half the caterpillars.

1:03:35.100 --> 1:03:36.300
What?

1:03:37.700 --> 1:03:39.667
Have a look.
I put one under the scope.

1:03:49.266 --> 1:03:52.166
What?
OE.

1:03:52.300 --> 1:03:54.900
OE. Ophryocystis elektroscirrha.

1:03:55.033 --> 1:03:57.467
It's a parasite that infects Monarchs.

1:03:57.600 --> 1:03:59.734
Do you see how dark it is?

1:03:59.867 --> 1:04:02.300
Yeah. How did that happen?

1:04:02.433 --> 1:04:05.033
Pesticides on milkweed
is the most common reason.

1:04:05.166 --> 1:04:08.400
Farmers are using it to control
the spread of the gypsy moth.

1:04:08.533 --> 1:04:11.133
Which means other rhopalocera
get caught in the crossfire.

1:04:12.367 --> 1:04:13.600
Butterflies.

1:04:13.734 --> 1:04:16.066
Emily, I swear I washed
everything I brought in.

1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:19.300
No, no, it's not your fault.

1:04:19.433 --> 1:04:20.767
Some of the powders and sprays
they use now

1:04:20.900 --> 1:04:22.400
are impossible to get out.

1:04:22.533 --> 1:04:24.800
Or an infected insect
got in here.

1:04:24.934 --> 1:04:27.233
Taylor warned me
that there was an outbreak.

1:04:27.367 --> 1:04:29.734
This happens all the time
in the wild.

1:04:29.867 --> 1:04:32.700
Millions of butterflies every
single year.

1:04:32.834 --> 1:04:35.800
Between them and our bee
population dying off,

1:04:35.934 --> 1:04:38.400
our entire ecosystem is
in jeopardy.

1:04:38.533 --> 1:04:39.934
So what do we do?

1:04:41.667 --> 1:04:44.400
First, we need to isolate the
surviving caterpillars

1:04:44.533 --> 1:04:45.800
for the next few days.

1:04:45.934 --> 1:04:48.633
And we need to look for some
milkweed in the wild.

1:04:49.667 --> 1:04:51.400
We can't take
any more chances.

1:04:51.533 --> 1:04:54.266
Emily, we have a bigger problem.

1:04:54.400 --> 1:04:55.734
I know.

1:04:55.867 --> 1:05:00.300
We're going to need at
least 700 more caterpillars.

1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:07.767
How many do you have? 50?

1:05:07.900 --> 1:05:09.834
No, it was OE. We're pretty sure
it's run its course.

1:05:09.967 --> 1:05:11.266
Whatever you can give us.

1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:12.800
Jared, it's Emily. Hi.

1:05:12.934 --> 1:05:15.600
I know, it's awful.
But can you help us out?

1:05:15.734 --> 1:05:18.000
I'll call them. Thank you.

1:05:21.967 --> 1:05:23.467
Farmer:
Here's what I can spare.

1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:24.800
Thanks,
I really appreciate this.

1:05:24.934 --> 1:05:26.834
Farmer:
Hope it's enough.

1:05:26.967 --> 1:05:28.367
Take care!

1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:35.867
Is this all you have?

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.200
Farmer:
Yeah, this is all of it.

1:05:37.333 --> 1:05:39.333
Thank you.
No problem.

1:06:07.533 --> 1:06:08.834
How short are we?

1:06:08.967 --> 1:06:10.500
Four hundred.

1:06:10.633 --> 1:06:13.000
We're never going to find
another 400 caterpillars.

1:06:13.133 --> 1:06:14.600
We've called everyone.

1:06:17.200 --> 1:06:19.000
Not everyone.

1:06:23.867 --> 1:06:25.667
This is going to be painful.

1:06:45.900 --> 1:06:48.300
You've got to be joking.

1:06:56.467 --> 1:07:00.600
So let me get this straight.
Now you want my help,

1:07:00.734 --> 1:07:03.300
after you've swooped in and
stole the job from me.

1:07:03.433 --> 1:07:05.900
I didn't steal it.
She chose me.

1:07:06.033 --> 1:07:08.266
Mm-hm, after you
convinced her to.

1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:10.633
Well, duh. Ladies.

1:07:10.767 --> 1:07:13.233
Maybe we should just stick to
the subject at hand?

1:07:14.700 --> 1:07:16.800
Do you have 400 caterpillars?

1:07:16.934 --> 1:07:18.900
Well, obviously I do,

1:07:19.033 --> 1:07:21.233
if I was prepared to give 1,500.

1:07:21.367 --> 1:07:24.233
Well, I know that's what you
told Rebecca, but--

1:07:24.367 --> 1:07:27.000
Okay. Fine.

1:07:27.133 --> 1:07:28.667
I wouldn't have come close.

1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:30.533
I don't even have 400.

1:07:33.133 --> 1:07:35.400
Well, we'll take whatever
you have.

1:07:35.533 --> 1:07:37.767
I'm not just going to
sell them to you.

1:07:37.900 --> 1:07:41.166
What, so you get all the press
and all the glory?

1:07:41.300 --> 1:07:42.800
I don't want to buy them.

1:07:42.934 --> 1:07:45.367
I'm not just going to give
them to you.

1:07:46.967 --> 1:07:49.734
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

1:07:50.767 --> 1:07:52.834
let's team up together.

1:07:52.967 --> 1:07:54.100
I'm sorry, what?
I'm sorry, what?

1:07:54.233 --> 1:07:56.300
We can do this together.

1:07:56.433 --> 1:08:00.233
Let's make this event
one no one will ever forget.

1:08:00.367 --> 1:08:02.166
Are you being serious?

1:08:02.300 --> 1:08:04.200
Yes.

1:08:04.333 --> 1:08:07.133
Well, I don't know what to say.

1:08:09.166 --> 1:08:13.033
To a new partnership?

1:08:13.166 --> 1:08:14.834
Uh...
If--

1:08:14.967 --> 1:08:16.467
If what?

1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:19.500
If you promise to learn more
about butterflies.

1:08:19.633 --> 1:08:22.834
Why they're so special,
what they do for our world,

1:08:22.967 --> 1:08:25.300
and why what we do is
so important.

1:08:25.433 --> 1:08:27.967
I want you to love them
as much as I do.

1:08:28.100 --> 1:08:30.033
I do love butterflies.

1:08:30.166 --> 1:08:33.433
I might not know as much as you
about the science of everything.

1:08:35.867 --> 1:08:37.567
Okay, I don't know anything
about the science.

1:08:37.700 --> 1:08:38.900
But that doesn't matter,

1:08:39.033 --> 1:08:42.000
because I've always loved butterflies.

1:08:42.133 --> 1:08:46.233
My mom was a fabulous gardener.

1:08:46.367 --> 1:08:48.200
And she had a big garden.

1:08:48.333 --> 1:08:52.200
My mom had a nice garden, too.

1:08:52.333 --> 1:08:54.533
And one of my earliest
childhood memories

1:08:54.667 --> 1:08:56.233
was running through
the garden and--

1:08:56.367 --> 1:08:58.900
Chasing the butterflies.

1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:04.400
Well.

1:09:10.033 --> 1:09:12.800
All right.

1:09:12.934 --> 1:09:14.700
Oh, there's just one problem.

1:09:14.834 --> 1:09:18.633
We're going to be about
a hundred caterpillars short.

1:09:20.066 --> 1:09:22.467
I guess we'll have to find the
rest in the wild.

1:09:23.867 --> 1:09:26.600
Um, that's kind of a lot to pick
from random leaves.

1:09:26.734 --> 1:09:29.200
Wait, I-- I think I have
an idea.

1:09:29.333 --> 1:09:31.734
My daughter is doing a school
project on butterflies.

1:09:31.867 --> 1:09:33.567
They found a bunch of milkweed
around the school.

1:09:33.700 --> 1:09:36.567
I could talk to the teacher and
see if maybe

1:09:36.700 --> 1:09:40.200
she could recruit a few of the
students for a, uh,

1:09:40.333 --> 1:09:42.900
"special assignment."

1:09:43.033 --> 1:09:44.200
That's a great idea.

1:09:44.333 --> 1:09:46.300
Well, cheers.

1:09:46.433 --> 1:09:48.567
You finally came to your senses.

1:09:51.033 --> 1:09:53.900
By the way, um,
are you still single?

1:09:56.934 --> 1:09:58.734
Uh, it's complicated.

1:09:58.867 --> 1:10:03.367
Does anyone know what kind of
animal a butterfly is? Yes.

1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:07.767
An insect! And there are 20,000
different species.

1:10:07.900 --> 1:10:09.300
Emily:
Very good!

1:10:10.734 --> 1:10:12.133
Yes?

1:10:12.266 --> 1:10:13.567
Are you a professor?

1:10:13.700 --> 1:10:16.233
Now, I'm a lepidopterologist.

1:10:16.367 --> 1:10:18.400
What's a lepi-dop-a-gee?

1:10:20.166 --> 1:10:21.633
Someone who studies butterflies.

1:10:21.767 --> 1:10:24.934
That's right. And who can tell
me what a butterfly eats?

1:10:25.066 --> 1:10:27.133
Nectar. Sorry.

1:10:27.266 --> 1:10:30.200
That's right.
Butterflies eat nectar,

1:10:30.333 --> 1:10:32.100
and why is that so important?

1:10:32.233 --> 1:10:35.734
Because that's how butterflies
pollenate flowers and plants.

1:10:35.867 --> 1:10:38.900
You told me to get more interested.

1:10:39.033 --> 1:10:41.934
Now how many of you can tell me,

1:10:42.066 --> 1:10:44.734
besides our friend Mandy here,

1:10:44.867 --> 1:10:46.700
what type of caterpillar
this is?

1:10:46.834 --> 1:10:48.433
Is it a Monarch?

1:10:48.567 --> 1:10:51.233
It is a Monarch, and how would
all of you like to go

1:10:51.367 --> 1:10:54.300
looking for Monarch caterpillars
on a scavenger hunt?!

1:10:56.266 --> 1:10:58.800
Okay, whoever finds the most caterpillars

1:10:58.934 --> 1:11:00.834
gets a home butterfly kit.

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:04.800
Everybody follow me.

1:11:30.233 --> 1:11:33.600
Mandy: All right, children.
let's go get 'em!

1:11:33.734 --> 1:11:35.300
Good job, kids!

1:11:37.633 --> 1:11:40.433
Be careful! Oh, don't squish it.

1:11:49.767 --> 1:11:51.033
You go!

1:11:57.166 --> 1:11:58.834
Get 'em!

1:12:10.900 --> 1:12:12.367
Want a caterpillar?

1:12:12.500 --> 1:12:14.367
Uh, no thank you.

1:12:22.567 --> 1:12:24.600
One of the moms just dropped
this off.

1:12:24.734 --> 1:12:26.233
Emily:
Oh, great!

1:12:26.367 --> 1:12:29.367
Let's keep them separated until
we know they're healthy.

1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:31.433
Should we feel bad about taking
these from the wild?

1:12:31.567 --> 1:12:33.266
I mean, picture it this way.

1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:35.333
Half of them would have been
eaten. Nature's not kind.

1:12:35.467 --> 1:12:37.367
Nice.
It's true.

1:12:37.500 --> 1:12:39.233
They'll be back in the wild
soon enough.

1:12:39.367 --> 1:12:41.734
Well, how long will this take?

1:12:41.867 --> 1:12:45.400
If we're lucky, about two weeks.

1:12:45.533 --> 1:12:47.367
What do we do now?

1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:49.266
We wait.
And hope.

1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:51.200
And pray.

1:12:57.233 --> 1:12:59.166
Hi, Jill.

1:12:59.300 --> 1:13:01.266
Yeah, uh, just one second.

1:13:06.100 --> 1:13:07.233
Hi.

1:13:07.367 --> 1:13:10.467
Great news.
I just spoke to Amy at Breck,

1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:12.166
and Amanda has been accepted!

1:13:12.300 --> 1:13:13.467
She has?

1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:17.066
Yes! I'm so excited,
and your father is thrilled.

1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:20.333
You told him?
Jill: Of course. I told you.

1:13:20.467 --> 1:13:22.467
People can't buy their way into
this school, Garrett.

1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:24.066
This is a pretty big deal.

1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:26.233
No, yeah, no... it's...

1:13:26.367 --> 1:13:28.300
It's a big deal.

1:13:28.433 --> 1:13:31.367
It's terrific.
Thank you, Jill.

1:13:44.967 --> 1:13:46.166
Hey.

1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:48.600
Hey.

1:13:52.934 --> 1:13:55.000
You okay?

1:13:55.133 --> 1:13:56.433
Yeah.

1:13:57.467 --> 1:13:59.266
Then why don't you seem like it?

1:14:01.667 --> 1:14:03.633
We're moving to New York
next week.

1:14:06.166 --> 1:14:07.300
Oh.

1:14:07.433 --> 1:14:10.567
This doesn't come without
mixed emotions.

1:14:10.700 --> 1:14:13.233
I just, I have to think
about Amanda.

1:14:13.367 --> 1:14:15.233
You know, I have to put her
needs first.

1:14:15.367 --> 1:14:18.433
Amanda will be happy
wherever she is,

1:14:18.567 --> 1:14:20.066
as long as she's with you.

1:14:21.700 --> 1:14:24.867
It's a good school she got in.
You know, it's one of the best.

1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.467
And she's got all the history
with Jill...

1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:29.467
It's the right decision.

1:14:31.567 --> 1:14:32.800
You sure?

1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:35.900
Yeah.

1:14:41.767 --> 1:14:44.934
Listen, I won't be able to be
there for the wedding.

1:14:45.066 --> 1:14:46.967
But I'd like to help out,

1:14:47.100 --> 1:14:49.066
do anything I can before
I leave.

1:14:50.934 --> 1:14:52.533
I'd like that.

1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:38.500
Daddy, look!

1:15:38.633 --> 1:15:40.066
I see it!

1:15:42.667 --> 1:15:44.333
I named her after Mommy.

1:15:44.467 --> 1:15:46.333
I remember.

1:15:46.467 --> 1:15:48.166
Sarah the butterfly.

1:15:48.300 --> 1:15:50.800
Amanda:
Yeah.

1:15:59.600 --> 1:16:02.367
No matter how many times
I see it,

1:16:02.500 --> 1:16:04.700
it's still a wonder.

1:16:08.700 --> 1:16:10.533
I can't believe we pulled this off.

1:16:10.667 --> 1:16:11.767
Mandy:
I can't either.

1:16:11.900 --> 1:16:14.667
That was insane,
and this is lovely.

1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:16.734
To our new friendship.

1:16:16.867 --> 1:16:19.867
And partnership.

1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:22.567
Really? After everything?

1:16:22.700 --> 1:16:24.066
Why not?

1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:26.433
You are like the perfect person.

1:16:26.567 --> 1:16:28.834
It's so annoying.

1:16:30.367 --> 1:16:32.600
I'll drink to that.

1:16:32.734 --> 1:16:36.734
Well, here's to 1,501 butterflies.

1:16:36.867 --> 1:16:38.867
Cheers!
Cheers!

1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000
I couldn't have done this
without you guys.

1:16:41.133 --> 1:16:42.934
Well, don't forget me.

1:16:43.066 --> 1:16:44.533
I mean, you couldn't have
done it without me

1:16:44.667 --> 1:16:46.500
and my amazing skills with
a hammer and nails.

1:16:46.633 --> 1:16:48.834
Yeah, you mean the one that
bashed your thumb?

1:16:48.967 --> 1:16:50.200
Ouch.

1:16:51.667 --> 1:16:53.834
Seriously, though.
This was a lot of fun,

1:16:53.967 --> 1:16:58.266
so thank you for including
Amanda, and me.

1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:00.066
Thank you.

1:17:08.433 --> 1:17:10.166
You are so welcome sweetie.

1:17:10.300 --> 1:17:12.734
You come back and visit me
anytime, okay?

1:17:12.867 --> 1:17:15.233
I will. I'll miss you.

1:17:18.700 --> 1:17:20.467
Larry: You've gotta try one of
these burgers.

1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:23.600
Oh, um,
I'm-- I'm stuffed.

1:17:23.734 --> 1:17:25.767
Nonsense.
I'm taking a grilling class.

1:17:25.900 --> 1:17:27.166
The cheese on the inside
of the burgers,

1:17:27.300 --> 1:17:28.800
it melted when
I charbroiled them.

1:17:28.934 --> 1:17:30.066
They're fantastic.

1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:31.667
Uh, I'll take two.
Ah!

1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:33.967
Don't encourage him.

1:17:34.100 --> 1:17:35.233
There you are, good man.

1:17:37.233 --> 1:17:40.200
Oh, um... Our car is here.

1:17:42.133 --> 1:17:43.600
What happened to your SUV?

1:17:43.734 --> 1:17:45.333
I sold it.

1:17:46.734 --> 1:17:49.867
This all happened so fast.
Safe trip.

1:17:50.900 --> 1:17:52.266
Thanks.

1:17:52.400 --> 1:17:53.834
Bye, Garrett.

1:17:53.967 --> 1:17:56.066
See you.

1:17:56.200 --> 1:17:58.333
Larry, how about I try
those burgers

1:17:58.467 --> 1:17:59.800
next time I'm back in town?

1:17:59.934 --> 1:18:01.467
You do that.

1:18:01.600 --> 1:18:02.967
You take care, son.

1:18:03.100 --> 1:18:05.033
Garrett:
Thanks. You too.

1:18:05.166 --> 1:18:07.367
I'll walk you guys out.

1:18:19.133 --> 1:18:20.700
Well, good luck at the wedding.

1:18:20.834 --> 1:18:22.700
Thank you.

1:18:22.834 --> 1:18:25.166
You know, I really wish that
I could be there.

1:18:25.300 --> 1:18:27.166
I get it.

1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:31.900
I'm really gonna miss you.

1:18:32.033 --> 1:18:34.567
I'll miss you too, sweetheart.

1:18:46.633 --> 1:18:49.367
Well, take care of yourself.

1:18:49.500 --> 1:18:51.400
Yeah. You too.

1:18:57.433 --> 1:18:59.000
You okay?

1:19:02.100 --> 1:19:03.667
I'm fine.

1:19:07.700 --> 1:19:09.600
I feel-- I feel bad about this.

1:19:09.734 --> 1:19:12.133
I just feel like the timing
was off.

1:19:14.433 --> 1:19:16.633
Don't feel bad.

1:19:16.767 --> 1:19:19.367
And the timing was really good.

1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:22.066
I feel great.

1:19:22.200 --> 1:19:25.800
And I haven't felt great
in a really long while, so...

1:19:27.834 --> 1:19:30.700
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

1:19:33.934 --> 1:19:36.300
You know, I, uh...

1:19:36.433 --> 1:19:39.066
I kinda wish Amanda was born
a month earlier.

1:19:39.200 --> 1:19:41.700
That way we could have
spent a bit more time together.

1:19:41.834 --> 1:19:44.266
That would have been May 10th?

1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:46.367
Nah, we were booked up
that day.

1:19:48.367 --> 1:19:50.266
Well, I guess we never would
have met, then.

1:19:50.400 --> 1:19:52.367
It's funny how the world
works things out.

1:19:53.700 --> 1:19:55.166
Yeah.

1:20:26.433 --> 1:20:28.400
Hello? Oh.

1:20:31.667 --> 1:20:34.734
Sweetie, don't you think
it's time that we let Sarah go?

1:20:34.867 --> 1:20:37.233
Not yet! Emily said I could keep
her for a week.

1:20:37.367 --> 1:20:40.033
Well, why don't you bring her
and your suitcase

1:20:40.166 --> 1:20:42.233
over to the car?
I'll meet you over there.

1:20:42.367 --> 1:20:43.734
Okay.

1:20:45.667 --> 1:20:46.867
Is that everything?

1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:48.200
Yeah.

1:20:49.667 --> 1:20:51.600
It's funny, I feel like I'm
forgetting something.

1:20:51.734 --> 1:20:53.100
We'll have it shipped.

1:20:53.233 --> 1:20:55.400
Come on, we're gonna miss
the flight.

1:20:55.533 --> 1:20:57.266
So I got an interesting call.

1:20:57.400 --> 1:20:59.066
Oh yeah? About what?

1:20:59.200 --> 1:21:00.967
Well, the Bureau Chief
in Barcelona.

1:21:01.100 --> 1:21:03.900
I'm not taking it, of course,
but it was interesting.

1:21:11.934 --> 1:21:14.100
From this moment forward,

1:21:14.233 --> 1:21:16.100
you will never be alone.

1:21:16.233 --> 1:21:19.367
You will carry with you the love
of another person

1:21:19.500 --> 1:21:23.834
giving you a completeness and
renewed likeness.

1:21:23.967 --> 1:21:26.467
May your life together be
immersed in love...

1:21:26.600 --> 1:21:28.033
How much longer?

1:21:28.166 --> 1:21:31.834
Well, according to Rebecca's
itinerary, 18 seconds.

1:21:31.967 --> 1:21:34.100
You have given
and received a ring

1:21:34.233 --> 1:21:36.867
as a symbol of your promises.
By the power...

1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:38.900
Okay, everybody.
Get ready.

1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:42.367
Okay, now.

1:21:42.500 --> 1:21:44.133
Okay, now!

1:21:44.266 --> 1:21:47.433
Pastor: I pronounce you
husband and wife.

1:22:14.033 --> 1:22:18.033
Family and friends,
over 1,500 butterflies

1:22:18.166 --> 1:22:19.934
released into the wild.

1:22:30.233 --> 1:22:31.533
You okay?

1:22:31.667 --> 1:22:33.633
Yeah. We did it.

1:22:34.900 --> 1:22:36.700
That's not what I meant.

1:22:38.133 --> 1:22:40.934
Honestly,
I've never felt better.

1:22:45.400 --> 1:22:47.000
How about now?

1:22:52.734 --> 1:22:55.100
What?

1:22:55.233 --> 1:22:56.900
Emily!

1:22:57.033 --> 1:22:58.500
Amanda!

1:23:01.033 --> 1:23:03.233
We forgot we have to let her go
with the others.

1:23:03.367 --> 1:23:06.333
Oh my gosh, you're right!
She's our 1,501.

1:23:08.200 --> 1:23:09.300
What are you...

1:23:09.433 --> 1:23:12.834
We had a record to break,
didn't we?

1:23:12.967 --> 1:23:15.233
Okay, sweetie,
time to let Sarah go.

1:23:36.700 --> 1:23:39.467
Well, congratulations
on the record.

1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:40.800
Hi.

1:23:40.934 --> 1:23:42.367
Hi.

1:23:43.400 --> 1:23:44.767
What happened?

1:23:47.100 --> 1:23:48.567
Amanda's heart is here.

1:23:48.700 --> 1:23:50.667
And I realized that mine is too.

1:23:54.266 --> 1:23:56.133
So you're staying?

1:23:56.266 --> 1:23:58.300
Well, I mean, somebody has to
expand that Flight House

1:23:58.433 --> 1:24:00.400
now that you've hit
the big time.

1:24:02.433 --> 1:24:04.633
And I want to be with you.

1:24:20.700 --> 1:24:23.400
Funny how the world
works things out.

1:24:23.533 --> 1:24:26.934
Well, I guess it's not
so complicated after all.
