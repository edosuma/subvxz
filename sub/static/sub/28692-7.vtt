00:02.670 --> 00:04.570
Gordon: Previously
on "MasterChef"...

00:04.610 --> 00:06.470
This incredible tenth season

00:06.510 --> 00:09.180
continues with this
mystery box...

00:09.210 --> 00:10.640
- Yes!
- What?

00:10.680 --> 00:12.910
- Aarón: Let's move!
- You want to make

00:12.950 --> 00:15.350
the best dish possible, you got
to use the appropriate equipment.

00:15.380 --> 00:17.750
I've cooked well over a hundred
pounds of skirt steak in my day.

00:17.790 --> 00:19.520
- Okay, you know what, Evan?
- Oh, wow.

00:19.550 --> 00:22.060
The ( bleep ) that you dole
out will come back at you.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.890
Gordon: ...with just three
home cooks gaining immunity.

00:24.930 --> 00:27.930
- I absolutely love this dish.
- Joe: Wow.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.060
- Gordon: Shari.
- Nick.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.100
- Thank you, Chef.
- Wuta.

00:30.130 --> 00:32.430
- Whoo!
- There you go!

00:32.470 --> 00:35.240
Sam, Liz, and Fred,

00:35.270 --> 00:38.340
you three have the worst
dishes of the night.

00:38.370 --> 00:42.380
Those of you still down
here face elimination.

00:42.410 --> 00:45.710
- Tonight...
- It's your first dessert challenge.

00:45.750 --> 00:48.280
...it's a demo from me that
you won't want to miss.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.120
- Awesome.
- Oh!

00:50.150 --> 00:51.420
And an elimination challenge...

00:52.820 --> 00:53.750
- ...with an ending

00:53.790 --> 00:55.260
that surprises everyone.

00:55.290 --> 00:58.030
- I don't like it at all.
- I...

00:58.060 --> 00:59.330
Gordon: This could
send you home tonight.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074

01:11.740 --> 01:13.610
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.380
- Whoo!
- Welcome back to the amazing

01:16.410 --> 01:18.250
tenth season of "MasterChef."

01:18.280 --> 01:19.550
Let's do this today.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.810
Sam: Going into this challenge,

01:20.850 --> 01:22.550
I'm not feeling very confident.

01:22.580 --> 01:25.050
I'm coming off of the worst
performance I've had so far.

01:25.090 --> 01:28.420
I just need to regroup, focus,
and get some confidence back.

01:28.460 --> 01:31.790
Honestly, it's been the
most talented pool

01:31.830 --> 01:34.060
of home cooks we've ever seen.

01:34.090 --> 01:36.630
But you know what's
on the line tonight.

01:36.660 --> 01:39.100
At least one of you
will be eliminated

01:39.130 --> 01:41.170
from this competition.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.810
Yesterday, three of you
exceeded our expectations.

01:44.840 --> 01:48.840
That's why you are all three
safe up on the balcony.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.850
For the rest of you, it
is time now to put on

01:51.880 --> 01:54.850
your black aprons to
face elimination.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.980
Liz: Being unsafe
and having to cook

01:57.020 --> 01:59.420
in the elimination
challenge is scary.

01:59.450 --> 02:01.860
But I'm not leaving "MasterChef"
until I win this thing.

02:01.890 --> 02:07.090
Your upcoming elimination challenge
will put you in a sticky situation.

02:07.130 --> 02:09.500
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.830
That's right, it's your
first dessert challenge.

02:12.870 --> 02:15.140
Nothing should scare
you guys more.

02:15.170 --> 02:17.610
Keturah: I don't eat desserts,

02:17.640 --> 02:19.440
I don't make desserts,

02:19.470 --> 02:22.540
so I am losing it right now.

02:22.580 --> 02:23.940
Are you ready to
face your fears?

02:23.980 --> 02:26.910
All: Yes, Chef!

02:29.920 --> 02:31.890
What's under here is
one of my favorites.

02:31.920 --> 02:35.720
It is a classic, delicious
French dessert.

02:35.760 --> 02:39.060
- A stunning...

02:39.090 --> 02:42.060
- A tarte tatin! - ...caramelized
pear tarte tatin.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.670
- Oh, yes!
- Yes.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.540
Dorian: I was hoping
for a crème brulee.

02:47.570 --> 02:49.300
Even a soufflé.

02:49.340 --> 02:52.170
But I've never seen
on "MasterChef"

02:52.210 --> 02:54.540
something so technical.

02:54.580 --> 02:57.010
Chef Ramsay is pulling out
the big guns this season.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.510
Now to make this dish correctly,

02:58.550 --> 03:02.580
it takes utter precision,
skill, finesse,

03:02.620 --> 03:05.250
and in your case, a little help.

03:05.290 --> 03:07.760
That's why I'm about to
show you how it's done.

03:07.790 --> 03:10.320
Noah: Hallelujah. So,
the master blaster

03:10.360 --> 03:12.230
is going to show
us how to do this.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.500
It's a dream come true, really.

03:14.530 --> 03:18.600
Tonight, you'll have 60 minutes to
cook a caramelized tarte tatin.

03:18.630 --> 03:21.100
The secret is the
pastry and the fruit.

03:21.130 --> 03:23.000
You got apples,
pineapples, peaches.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.070
Take it any direction you wish,

03:25.110 --> 03:26.840
but there's steps
you've got to follow.

03:26.870 --> 03:28.910
First thing, the short crust.

03:28.940 --> 03:32.780
Flour, sugar, salt, okay?
And your butter.

03:32.810 --> 03:34.350
Make sure your butter
is nice and firm.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.520
The most important thing
in this short crust

03:35.550 --> 03:37.020
is to make sure it's robust.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.790
Any of you ever made a
tarte tatin before?

03:39.820 --> 03:41.690
I made one for a
Christmas party at work.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.390
Wow. Make this dough
nice and pliable.

03:45.430 --> 03:48.600
Let that rest now.
Now, for the caramel,

03:48.630 --> 03:52.770
take a cast iron pan, place
that butter into the pan.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.970
From there, fingers,
push that down.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.970
Lightly sprinkle the sugar, and
that's the base of the caramel.

03:59.010 --> 04:01.380
You got the butter,
you got the sugar.

04:01.410 --> 04:04.110
Some cinnamon sticks,
some star anise,

04:04.140 --> 04:07.980
and then a beautiful
vanilla pod.

04:08.020 --> 04:09.380
Now, the pears.

04:09.420 --> 04:12.790
You place the round
part into the butter

04:12.820 --> 04:14.990
at a 90 degree angle,
and the point comes up.

04:15.020 --> 04:17.660
All the way around.
Look at that there.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.329
We put that on.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.160
We'll start seeing that
sugar and that butter melt,

04:21.190 --> 04:23.400
but you need to be
super careful here.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.600
Caramel, as you know, we're going
to take it to 380 degrees.

04:25.630 --> 04:27.670
We're not burning it, but we're going
to get it really nice and dark.

04:27.700 --> 04:31.070
Take this caramel too
far and it's bitter.

04:31.100 --> 04:34.240
I have no clue how I'm
going to do all this stuff

04:34.270 --> 04:35.480
as smoothly as he's doing it.

04:35.510 --> 04:36.910
Now for the pastry.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.280
The secret here is to make sure

04:38.310 --> 04:41.010
we do not roll this
pastry too thin.

04:41.050 --> 04:44.990
You're looking for about
3/4 of a centimeter thick.

04:45.020 --> 04:47.190
Then we can see the color, right?
It's nice and dark.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.960
The smell is incredible.
Take that off the gas.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.260
You go onto the
board, super careful.

04:52.290 --> 04:55.960
We lift up and we go
over the pan quickly.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.630
- Awesome. - Then you lift up the
pear and tuck the pastry in.

04:59.670 --> 05:02.700
Up and twist. Lift
up and tuck in.

05:02.740 --> 05:06.610
Super important...
one, two, three.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.640
If we don't pierce that pastry,

05:08.680 --> 05:11.350
you're going to steam it
underneath, and it'll be raw.

05:11.380 --> 05:12.810
Into the oven she goes.

05:12.850 --> 05:15.220
18 to 20 minutes, 375.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.850
Wuta: I'm so grateful
I'm up here,

05:16.880 --> 05:18.850
because this is one
of the challenges

05:18.890 --> 05:21.960
that either makes a
chef or breaks a chef.

05:21.990 --> 05:24.190
I've never even seen
this dessert before.

05:24.220 --> 05:27.030
Now, crème anglaise.
What is crème anglaise?

05:27.060 --> 05:29.400
It's custard. You start
off and bring your cream

05:29.430 --> 05:31.300
and your milk to a boil.

05:31.330 --> 05:34.200
As that's boiling,
whisk in the yolks,

05:34.230 --> 05:37.640
in with your sugar,
and we whisk.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.810
Now, I'm doing a
vanilla basic custard.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.840
What I want to see tonight
is some creativity.

05:41.880 --> 05:44.080
You can go any route.
In she goes.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.410
One third, a quick whisk.

05:46.450 --> 05:48.880
And then from there, back in.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.380
This is where you got
to be super careful.

05:50.420 --> 05:53.250
You turn the gas down,
nonstop stirring.

05:53.290 --> 05:55.760
As you start to see it
thickening, you take that off.

05:55.790 --> 05:56.990
I'm feeling nervous.

05:57.020 --> 05:58.660
It's a classic French dessert,

05:58.690 --> 06:01.160
so how do I put an
Indian twist on it?

06:01.190 --> 06:03.600
Out. Back on.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.870
380 degrees caramel.
Please be careful.

06:06.900 --> 06:11.910
Plate on top, firm
hand on, and twist.

06:11.940 --> 06:13.740
And there we have our
beautiful tarte tatin.

06:13.770 --> 06:15.240
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.440
- Wow.
- All right.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.410
Gordon: Well, guess what.

06:18.450 --> 06:21.520
We're not done yet.
Lights down, please.

06:21.550 --> 06:24.120
Cognac in. We're going to
flambé the tarte tatin.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.890
In. Tilt.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.090
- Noah: Awesome.
- Wow.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.960
Noah: Oh, my gosh.

06:32.730 --> 06:34.360
That smells so good.

06:34.390 --> 06:36.460
And then finally, a
beautiful sprinkling

06:36.500 --> 06:39.130
of powdered sugar across
the caramelized pastry.

06:39.170 --> 06:41.100
- And that is how

06:41.130 --> 06:44.770
a true MasterChef delivers
a caramelized tarte tatin.

06:44.810 --> 06:47.480
- Beautiful.
- Awesome.

06:47.510 --> 06:50.110
Micah: This tarte tatin challenge
is deceptively simple.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.710
I can see a thousand
ways it could go wrong.

06:52.750 --> 06:54.480
Your dough could be too thick.
You could burn the caramel.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.420
- You could burn your fruit.
- Head to your stations.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.790
- Yes, Joe.
- I'm honestly terrified

06:58.820 --> 07:01.150
because baking challenges
in the MasterChef kitchen

07:01.190 --> 07:02.320
are the toughest,

07:02.360 --> 07:03.960
and it has sent home

07:03.990 --> 07:05.460
some of the best cooks.

07:05.490 --> 07:08.800
Your 60 minutes start now.
Let's go.

07:08.830 --> 07:11.300
Aarón: Come on,
everyone, let's go.

07:12.370 --> 07:15.140
Damn, Subha.

07:15.170 --> 07:16.670
Renee: Running into the pantry,

07:16.700 --> 07:18.410
and I see all this
beautiful fruit.

07:18.440 --> 07:19.840
Peach is my favorite.

07:19.870 --> 07:21.510
Dorian: I doubt, Renee,
if you're going to need

07:21.540 --> 07:23.580
- that many peaches.
- First come, first serve.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.750
Oh, my God.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.450
Keturah: My strategy right now
is I'm making my dough first

07:29.480 --> 07:31.990
because I want it to
have ample time to rest.

07:32.020 --> 07:35.020
Get that pastry started.
Smart, Keturah.

07:36.220 --> 07:38.460
I'm feeling really anxious.

07:38.490 --> 07:40.760
I've never actually made
a tarte tatin before.

07:40.790 --> 07:43.200
Unbelievable, I know, being
that my family lives in France.

07:43.230 --> 07:46.100
But I just, um... I
don't eat desserts.

07:46.130 --> 07:48.000
Fred, like, knows
what he's doing,

07:48.040 --> 07:50.140
so he's just... he's loving this.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.210
I've been asking for a baking
challenge this whole time.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.710
I'm making an apple ginger
infused tarte tatin.

07:55.740 --> 07:57.310
I need to redeem
myself from being told

07:57.340 --> 07:59.610
that I was one of the worst
three dishes last night.

07:59.650 --> 08:01.210
And because I'm the
only one in the room

08:01.250 --> 08:03.220
who's made a tarte tatin before,

08:03.250 --> 08:04.480
I feel like they're
going to have much,

08:04.520 --> 08:06.020
much higher expectations of me.

08:06.050 --> 08:08.390
I'm excited about
this challenge.

08:08.420 --> 08:11.790
I've never made a tarte tatin
before, but I know cooking.

08:11.830 --> 08:14.190
I know baking. I've been blessed
to be able to cook and bake,

08:14.230 --> 08:16.460
and I definitely got this one.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.170
Noah: This is like an
upside-down fruitcake.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.530
I've never made that, of course,

08:20.570 --> 08:22.000
but I've eaten a hell
of a lot of them,

08:22.040 --> 08:23.470
because I used to be,
like, almost 400 pounds.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.410
So I definitely have
tasted a hundred cakes

08:25.440 --> 08:26.910
sort of similar to this.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.640
We don't really eat a lot
of desserts at home,

08:28.680 --> 08:30.640
and when we do, it's usually
something like an apple pie

08:30.680 --> 08:32.250
or something that's simple.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.049
This is an extremely
difficult dessert.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.480
I just have to stay
focused enough

08:35.520 --> 08:37.350
to not miss one of these steps.

08:37.380 --> 08:40.220
Good job, "Heimey."

08:40.250 --> 08:43.390
- Who's Heimey?
- Heimey is how you say "Jamie" in Spanish.

08:45.890 --> 08:48.030
Subha, all right, so talk to
us about your tarte tatin.

08:48.060 --> 08:52.500
I'm going to have a mixed one,
half pear and half apple.

08:52.530 --> 08:56.600
You're taking a big risk because you have
two different cook times. Good luck, Subha.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.410
Thank you.

08:59.410 --> 09:01.780
Just under 45 minutes to go.

09:06.710 --> 09:08.680
I demonstrated that
dish properly for them.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.250
The big question tonight is do
they become even more adventurous?

09:11.280 --> 09:13.090
Do they use the peaches? Do
they go down the pineapple?

09:13.120 --> 09:14.490
Do they use the banana?

09:16.120 --> 09:17.860
Keturah: I'm focusing
on my dough right now,

09:17.890 --> 09:19.860
and I'm about to run into
the kitchen to let it rest.

09:19.890 --> 09:24.260
- There we go, K. - My strategy
right now is to go with peach,

09:24.300 --> 09:26.770
but by the time I make
it into the pantry,

09:26.800 --> 09:29.040
all the peaches are gone.

09:29.070 --> 09:33.240
I don't believe it. How are
there no peaches left?

09:33.270 --> 09:35.880
The only other fruit that
I'm fairly familiar with

09:35.910 --> 09:38.250
is a pineapple.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.980
I've used it in
curries and sauces,

09:40.010 --> 09:42.820
but definitely don't know how
to work with it on a pastry.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.150
Pineapple is risky.

09:46.190 --> 09:47.890
Nick: I would not
use a pineapple.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.290
Really watery and really acidic.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.260
I sliced the
pineapple into rings

09:53.290 --> 09:54.730
because I figure that's the way

09:54.760 --> 09:56.330
that it should be in a dessert,

09:56.360 --> 09:59.570
but after that, I have no
clue what to do with it.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.000
- Right. How are you feeling?
- Very, very nervous.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.340
You got your work cut out.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.940
One of the most
difficult fruits.

10:06.970 --> 10:08.940
Fibrous, difficult, watery.

10:08.980 --> 10:11.110
I've never made this before.
I wanted to use peaches.

10:11.140 --> 10:12.450
The peaches had run out.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.350
Choosing pineapple
is bloody brave.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.650
Nobody else is doing pineapple.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.350
In fact, one's doing pineapple.

10:17.380 --> 10:18.990
Everybody else is going
for the easy route,

10:19.020 --> 10:20.290
you know, the apples, the
pears, and the peaches.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.520
This is the most difficult.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.960
So this could send
you home tonight.

10:25.990 --> 10:28.260
Keturah: I am terrified.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.230
I can't do this.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.850
Keturah: I am terrified.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.880
I feel like this might be
the moment that I go home.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.850
Hey, you still got
40 minutes to go.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.690
You decided to do it. We're
going to go with it now.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.390
You pull this one off, you
will not be going home.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.690
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:55.720 --> 10:56.860
Do not crumble under pressure.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.960
Okay, thank you, Chef.

10:58.990 --> 11:00.690
Come on, Keturah. Don't
lose it now, sweetie.

11:00.730 --> 11:02.160
Okay.

11:04.560 --> 11:06.300
- Gordon: Keturah started crying.
- Aarón: You know what?

11:06.330 --> 11:08.800
The pressure, the fact that
this is an elimination,

11:08.840 --> 11:11.840
there's so many high
emotions going on right now.

11:11.870 --> 11:15.340
Sarah: This challenge is all about
making the perfect tarte tatin.

11:15.380 --> 11:17.680
Coming from a background
of military service,

11:17.710 --> 11:19.980
I can follow direction
really well.

11:20.010 --> 11:22.650
My strategy is to follow Gordon's
steps as much as possible,

11:22.680 --> 11:27.420
because if you can't follow
direction, you are done.

11:27.450 --> 11:30.560
Michael: I'm not
huge into sweets,

11:30.590 --> 11:32.730
but my fiancée has the biggest
sweet tooth in the world,

11:32.760 --> 11:34.390
so every single
Sunday, I'm baking.

11:34.430 --> 11:35.830
That's what I love to do.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.830
So, I'm definitely not
going home today.

11:37.870 --> 11:39.670
I can't. I've worked
too hard for this.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.040
Right. Young man, how
are you feeling?

11:42.070 --> 11:44.040
- Hey, I'm feeling awesome. - Tell me
about the dish. What are you doing?

11:44.070 --> 11:46.170
I'm doing a pear and apple tart.

11:46.210 --> 11:47.610
What are you worried about?

11:47.640 --> 11:49.340
Yesterday, I had some
trouble managing my time,

11:49.380 --> 11:50.680
and that's something I want
to pay attention to today.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.880
But you're keeping
your head down.

11:51.910 --> 11:53.580
You're turning into
one of the most

11:53.610 --> 11:55.220
articulate pupils, because
you're absorbing.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.780
I'm listening. I'm
paying attention

11:56.820 --> 11:58.620
to not just what I'm doing,
but everybody else is doing.

11:58.650 --> 12:00.650
- Focus. Come on. Good luck.
- Thank you.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.130
Thyme is on which shelf?

12:07.160 --> 12:09.600
Evan: I know next to nothing
about a tarte tatin.

12:09.630 --> 12:13.370
But I've got the deepest
knowledge base that's out there.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.770
I've traveled the world.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.600
I know about a ton
of ingredients.

12:16.640 --> 12:19.270
So I'm feeling really confident
and I'm super excited.

12:19.310 --> 12:22.380
So, Evan, are you a
big dessert baker?

12:22.410 --> 12:25.580
- No.
- Jeez, you have to be a complete package.

12:25.610 --> 12:27.250
I got plenty of package.

12:28.780 --> 12:30.420
I actually do bake a little.

12:30.450 --> 12:34.050
I have family members that
bake semi-professionally.

12:34.090 --> 12:35.620
That's not going to help you tonight.
You need to know...

12:35.660 --> 12:37.760
No, I spent a little time
with them learning some tips,

12:37.790 --> 12:40.760
- so...
- So what are you going to be doing?

12:40.790 --> 12:42.000
Talk to me here, Evan.

12:42.030 --> 12:44.970
It's going to be an apple...

12:45.000 --> 12:46.170
tarte tatin.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.400
Okay, are you doing
anything unique

12:48.440 --> 12:50.800
with your crème anglaise?

12:50.840 --> 12:53.310
I'm going to kind of fly
by the seat of my pants.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.240
- Uh, yeah.
- Anyway, Evan...

12:56.280 --> 12:58.650
- Thank you.
- It's a pleasure, gents.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.450
Evan: I'm not worried
in the least.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.420
I'm going to blow right
through this thing.

13:02.450 --> 13:04.990
I don't need Gordon's step
by step instructions.

13:05.020 --> 13:09.520
I can knock out awesome dishes
with what I got up here.

13:09.560 --> 13:13.460
So, come at me.

13:13.490 --> 13:16.460
All right, everyone,
just over 30 minutes.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.970
Your tarte tatin should
be caramelizing now.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.840
Shari: Looks good, Noah.
Looks good.

13:21.870 --> 13:23.640
Liz, those bananas look nice.

13:23.670 --> 13:26.710
The big Achilles' heel this
evening is that caramel,

13:26.740 --> 13:29.040
and having the confidence
to get it nice and dark

13:29.080 --> 13:30.610
before it goes into the oven.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.150
Sarah, that looks
really, really good.

13:32.180 --> 13:34.210
- Thank you.
- Good job.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.650
Beautiful. What's the
flavor of the caramel?

13:36.680 --> 13:38.820
- Vanilla and ginger.
- Love it.

13:38.850 --> 13:40.550
But can we get the caramel
where it needs to be?

13:40.590 --> 13:43.490
- Okay? Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

13:45.690 --> 13:49.830
Keturah: I am extremely
daunted by this challenge,

13:49.860 --> 13:54.530
but I need to calm down and
remember why I'm here.

13:54.570 --> 13:56.670
What goes well with pineapple?
Um, a bit of spice.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.070
Okay, some ginger.

13:58.110 --> 13:59.640
Why don't we take
that up a notch

13:59.670 --> 14:01.040
with a little bit of cayenne?

14:01.070 --> 14:02.740
I'm just thinking of everything

14:02.780 --> 14:06.050
that I would use ordinarily
in a savory dish.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.150
Gordon: Keturah's gone for the pineapple
because the peaches have gone.

14:08.180 --> 14:12.990
She's now back on track, and
she's cut it thinly into slices.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.720
- Yeah, she's smart.
- Okay, okay, okay.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.890
I'm seriously worried about Sam.

14:17.930 --> 14:20.330
He's gone and cut the
pineapple into chunks.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.260
- It's going to be fibrous.
- Yes.

14:22.300 --> 14:24.500
Sam: I'm sacrificing a lot
to be here right now.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.270
My wife is at home taking care
of our 11-month-old by herself.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.270
I have a busy job as an attorney

14:29.300 --> 14:31.070
that I'm basically
putting on hold.

14:31.100 --> 14:34.270
I can't go home.

14:34.310 --> 14:36.910
I wanted to make sure that my
caramelization happens correctly,

14:36.940 --> 14:38.750
and I don't want to leave
the station until then.

14:38.780 --> 14:41.280
The technique in
caramelizing, it is key.

14:41.310 --> 14:44.020
You can burn it or you
can under-caramelize it,

14:44.050 --> 14:45.420
so that is my current
nervous worry.

14:45.450 --> 14:48.360
Micah, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

14:48.390 --> 14:49.590
I'm feeling really confident.

14:49.620 --> 14:51.420
I just got to keep
an eye on this.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.730
I've never made a tarte tatin,
but I've made a lot of caramels,

14:53.760 --> 14:55.900
I've made a lot of crème
anglaises before.

14:55.930 --> 14:57.300
One day, I want to
open up a bakery.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.930
I love to do pastries.

14:58.970 --> 15:02.140
Oh, that caramel
makes me nervous.

15:02.170 --> 15:03.640
It looks done. Doesn't
it look done?

15:03.670 --> 15:06.110
- Oh, yeah.
- Everything is going well.

15:06.140 --> 15:09.580
I'm just waiting on the caramel.

15:09.610 --> 15:12.310
I go back there, and I smell it,

15:12.350 --> 15:14.050
and my heart drops to my shoes.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.780
It burned.

15:17.820 --> 15:20.290
Oh, Micah's is burning.
Micah's is burning.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.460
It's just a complete disaster.

15:24.820 --> 15:27.130
And I know I cannot serve that,

15:27.160 --> 15:28.830
because it will
completely ruin my dish.

15:31.970 --> 15:33.630
I'm done-zo.

15:43.940 --> 15:45.950
Look at Micah's caramel. There's
smoke coming out of that pan now.

15:45.980 --> 15:48.180
Micah: My caramel burned.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.490
It's just a complete disaster.

15:55.890 --> 15:57.320
You got this, Micah. Come on.

15:59.290 --> 16:02.430
Take a deep breath. You got it.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.860
I cannot let this send me home.

16:08.070 --> 16:09.600
What the heck's he doing?

16:09.640 --> 16:11.800
Shari: He's going to start over.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.870
I don't really know if
there's enough time

16:13.910 --> 16:16.680
to make another caramel,
but I have to go for it.

16:16.710 --> 16:18.550
Shari: You got this, Micah!
Come on.

16:18.580 --> 16:20.810
Aarón: You should be rolling
out your dough, everyone.

16:20.850 --> 16:25.620
Start to fabricate the look and the
aesthetic of your tarte tatin.

16:25.650 --> 16:28.220
Shari: All right, Noah.

16:28.260 --> 16:32.390
Dorian's got pecans in her pastry.
Love it.

16:32.430 --> 16:34.630
Shari: Oh, gosh. Sarah's
is going to burn, too.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.630
Oh, my God.

16:36.660 --> 16:39.830
Oh, no. Oh.

16:39.870 --> 16:41.670
My caramel is too dark.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.470
So, I would redo it. I
would just redo it.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.140
Oh, my God, oh, my
God, oh, my God.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.870
I don't have time
to start again.

16:46.910 --> 16:48.740
I'm trying to put
more butter in there,

16:48.780 --> 16:51.680
put a little bit more
sugar to try and save it.

16:51.710 --> 16:54.010
I'm just crossing my fingers
and saying a couple prayers

16:54.050 --> 16:56.420
- that it's going to work out.
- Nick: Come on, Sarah.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.850
You're good, you're good.
Don't panic.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.320
Guys, in the next three minutes,

17:00.350 --> 17:03.020
your tarte tatins have
got to be in the oven.

17:03.060 --> 17:07.490
- Noah: Yes, Chef.
- Allow 15 to 18 minutes cook time.

17:07.530 --> 17:10.859
Shari: Keturah,
you're doing awesome!

17:10.900 --> 17:13.329
- Fred's gone in the oven.
- Joe: In the oven. First one.

17:13.369 --> 17:15.069
- Wow.
- Good boy. Good.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.670
- Did you pierce the top?
- Yes, I did. I did six holes.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.710
- Good boy.
- Oh, for God's sake.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.910
I ( bleep ) up somehow.

17:22.940 --> 17:26.079
Sam: The caramel just isn't
as brown as I would like.

17:26.109 --> 17:28.580
Gordon: Now, Sam, he's cut
the pineapple into chunks.

17:28.620 --> 17:31.380
The caramel is going to be so weak because
there's so much juice in the pineapple.

17:31.420 --> 17:33.850
It's going to to negate a
lot of the caramelization.

17:33.890 --> 17:36.120
That's right. It won't happen.
He'll never get color on it.

17:36.160 --> 17:39.560
To me, it's certainly better
to be slightly under.

17:39.590 --> 17:41.230
If it's over-caramelized,
it'll be burnt.

17:46.230 --> 17:48.640
Evan: So, I'm looking
at the tarte tatin,

17:48.670 --> 17:50.470
and it looks wet,

17:50.500 --> 17:52.510
like there's almost a
little too much caramel.

17:53.470 --> 17:54.740
Let's do this.

17:54.770 --> 17:57.110
I decide I'm going to pour off

17:57.140 --> 17:59.950
a little bit of the
caramel liquid.

17:59.980 --> 18:01.080
What the hell is he doing?

18:01.110 --> 18:02.780
I know what I'm doing.

18:04.780 --> 18:06.150
That actually looks
kind of sexy.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.460
I promise you, if somebody
can do it, it's you.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.990
We're down to 21
minutes remaining.

18:13.030 --> 18:14.560
Nick: Come on, Subha, let's go.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.330
Let's go. Get it in the oven.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.670
Sarah, I want that in the oven
in the next three minutes.

18:18.700 --> 18:19.900
Let's go.

18:19.930 --> 18:21.600
Shari: Sarah,
you're doing great.

18:21.630 --> 18:24.600
Wuta: There we go, Micah.
Way to come back.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.270
You made me nervous
for a second.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.180
Micah: 18 minutes is all
a tarte tatin needs.

18:29.210 --> 18:31.980
I just pray that I'm going
to have it done in time.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.010
Guys, just under
18 minutes to go.

18:34.050 --> 18:36.620
Under 18 minutes to go.

18:38.390 --> 18:40.490
Shari: Great job, Micah.
Great job.

18:45.190 --> 18:47.990
Subha: I'm putting an
Indian inspired twist

18:48.030 --> 18:50.460
on the French tarte tatin.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.970
In the crème anglaise, I
want to use a rose flavor,

18:54.000 --> 18:55.670
and then use cardamom with it.

18:55.700 --> 19:01.170
- Rosewater, ooh!
- Mmm. Wow.

19:01.210 --> 19:04.440
- Man!
- So, Subha, he's going to be very unique.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.050
He's going to use rosewater, and he
seems like he's really fired up.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.820
Joe: I hope he knows
what he's doing.

19:08.850 --> 19:10.320
Just over ten minutes to go.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.990
Looking good! Looking good, Bri!

19:13.020 --> 19:14.890
Wuta: Let's go, y'all! Let's go!

19:14.920 --> 19:16.460
You guys got this.
You guys got this.

19:16.490 --> 19:17.990
Shari: Fred, you're
doing awesome.

19:18.020 --> 19:20.060
Fred: My tarte tatin
should be almost done.

19:21.590 --> 19:23.660
But I noticed it wasn't
cooking fast enough.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.030
It just needs so
much more color.

19:27.070 --> 19:29.640
This is insane.

19:29.670 --> 19:33.070
If I don't nail this, they're
just going to eject me.

19:33.110 --> 19:35.040
Shari: It's looking good, Liz.

19:35.070 --> 19:37.240
Holy cow. Look at that.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.410
Wow. That one looks...

19:38.450 --> 19:39.850
it looks like a chicken
pot pie, baby,

19:39.880 --> 19:41.350
in the South, baby!

19:41.380 --> 19:42.920
Fred, I can't wait to see it.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.990
Shari: Sam, that looks great!

19:48.020 --> 19:50.520
I have no ( bleep ) idea how
long this thing's been in there.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.100
- Now, Fred.
- Yeah.

19:56.130 --> 19:57.430
Gordon: Fred, tonight,
is in his element.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.670
I've never seen this
guy so focused.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.430
That is his calling,
guys, by the way.

20:01.470 --> 20:04.040
I mean, he wants to be
America's next MasterChef,

20:04.070 --> 20:06.270
but baking is his skill.

20:06.310 --> 20:08.440
Fred: I am having an
outright panic attack.

20:08.480 --> 20:09.940
If I leave it in there longer,

20:09.980 --> 20:11.440
my apples are going
to be overcooked.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.410
Everything comes
down to this moment.

20:14.450 --> 20:18.790
Is that cooked, Fred?
Is it cooked?

20:18.820 --> 20:21.420
The dough is really,
really undercooked.

20:26.490 --> 20:29.000
I think my pastry is
definitely too thick.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.570
I don't have a
whole lot of time.

20:34.070 --> 20:36.340
I'm staring right
at my death dish.

20:45.450 --> 20:47.580
Gordon: Five minutes
to go, guys!

20:47.610 --> 20:49.380
Shari: Looking good, guys.

20:49.420 --> 20:50.550
Fred: I'm freaking
out right now....

20:50.580 --> 20:52.150
Oh, jeez.

20:52.180 --> 20:53.420
...because it's still
not cooked through.

20:53.450 --> 20:55.320
Come on, Fred!

20:55.360 --> 20:56.890
But I'm definitely
running out of time,

20:56.920 --> 20:59.390
so it has to come out now.

20:59.430 --> 21:01.230
My pastry must be too thick,

21:01.260 --> 21:03.100
and it breaks my heart
into a million pieces,

21:03.130 --> 21:05.300
because the last thing
I want to go home on

21:05.330 --> 21:07.070
is something that I love to do.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.900
Shari: That looks
beautiful, Noah.

21:09.940 --> 21:12.510
The moment has come that I'm going
to have to frickin' do this flip.

21:12.540 --> 21:14.570
The moment of truth right here.

21:14.610 --> 21:16.310
Gordon: Hand, cloth, tip.

21:16.340 --> 21:18.750
Large plate. Has everybody
got a large plate?

21:18.780 --> 21:20.810
- All: Yes, Chef!
- How dramatic it's going to be

21:20.850 --> 21:23.650
when you invert that tarte tatin.
It's...

21:23.680 --> 21:26.150
Noah: You got one
shot to do this.

21:26.190 --> 21:28.620
If I drop it, it's over.
I'm going home.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.590
Oh!

21:33.630 --> 21:35.960
Shari: Hey, great job, Noah!
Whoo!

21:36.000 --> 21:38.870
Oh, Jamie, that was awesome.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.330
- Whoo, son!
- Shari: Beautiful.

21:41.370 --> 21:44.770
- Oh, yeah. - Shari: Liz, I'm
so proud of you. It's awesome.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.840
Ooh. Yay!

21:48.680 --> 21:51.540
What happened to
Evan's... what is that?

21:51.580 --> 21:55.880
Looking down at the tart,
it looks really dry.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.680
Did you drain off some
of that excess juice?

21:57.720 --> 21:59.850
- I did.
- Good. Did you keep it?

22:01.520 --> 22:02.790
That would've been genius.

22:02.820 --> 22:04.820
Never throw that
genius stuff away.

22:04.860 --> 22:07.390
You know, it's true. It has all
that flavor and that complexity.

22:07.430 --> 22:09.960
I really wish I didn't
toss that extra caramel,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.900
but when it's said and done,

22:12.930 --> 22:14.100
I'm happy with
what's on the plate.

22:20.070 --> 22:21.170
Tilt it!

22:21.210 --> 22:22.380
You need it nice and... oh!

22:22.410 --> 22:24.080
- Whoo!
- Yeah, Subha!

22:24.110 --> 22:26.210
Over! Over!

22:27.780 --> 22:29.650
Oh, my God. I think he did.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.590
You have brandy down your glove.

22:33.620 --> 22:36.090
- Over.
- Oh.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.020
There we go. You okay?
Is it burnt?

22:38.060 --> 22:38.990
No, no. Nothing at all, no.

22:39.030 --> 22:40.530
( bleep ) Subha.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.160
Two, three!

22:42.190 --> 22:43.260
Gordon: Take your time.

22:43.300 --> 22:45.200
Oh. Oh, do you smell that?

22:45.230 --> 22:46.830
Sarah: I hope it's not burnt.

22:46.870 --> 22:47.900
And it's hard to tell

22:47.930 --> 22:49.440
because I can't cut into it.

22:49.470 --> 22:52.240
Shari: Good job, Micah!

22:52.270 --> 22:54.440
Whoo! Great job, Micah!

22:54.470 --> 22:56.510
Micah: Even though I
did my caramel again,

22:56.540 --> 22:58.340
if I ruined those peaches
in that first caramel,

22:58.380 --> 23:00.710
that is going to transfer
into my tarte tatin.

23:00.750 --> 23:04.020
I'm just praying that acrid,
disgusting petrol taste...

23:04.050 --> 23:05.250
Damn.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.750
...did not affect my fruit.

23:06.790 --> 23:08.020
Everyone should be dusting!

23:08.050 --> 23:09.790
Dust! 30 seconds to go.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.390
Finish strong, finish strong!

23:11.420 --> 23:13.030
Not so confident.

23:13.060 --> 23:14.190
Gordon: Come on, let's go!

23:14.230 --> 23:17.900
10, 9, 8, 7,

23:17.930 --> 23:20.370
6, 5, 4,

23:20.400 --> 23:22.900
- 3, 2, 1!
- And stop!

23:22.940 --> 23:24.900
- Hands in the air!
- Hands in the air!

23:24.940 --> 23:27.740
That one was a blast!

23:28.840 --> 23:30.480
I'm worried if they'll ding me

23:30.510 --> 23:32.080
because I don't have a lot of...

23:32.110 --> 23:33.880
like, my caramel
evaporated into the tarte,

23:33.910 --> 23:36.120
so it's not as oozy
as everyone else's.

23:36.150 --> 23:38.820
- Well done!
- No matter what happens,

23:38.850 --> 23:41.420
- it was an honor to cook.
- Whoo, son!

23:41.450 --> 23:43.120
Never thought I'd be able
to do that in an hour.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.890
Holy cow, man.

23:46.930 --> 23:47.990
That's a big sucker.

23:48.030 --> 23:49.460
Why is it so fat?

23:49.500 --> 23:52.130
Joe: Because you put
12 peaches in there.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.000
- Tough challenge, right?
- All: Yes, Chef.

23:55.030 --> 23:58.300
Now it's time to taste.
Let's dig in.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.070
Did you have any trouble?

24:02.110 --> 24:03.980
Just a little bit.

24:08.980 --> 24:12.790
Liz, are you happy
with the way it looks?

24:12.820 --> 24:15.350
I've never made it before,
so I'm pretty happy with it.

24:15.390 --> 24:16.820
Sam: When I finished
the challenge,

24:16.860 --> 24:19.590
I'm mostly thinking
about the job I did,

24:19.630 --> 24:21.660
shortcuts I could've taken to
be a little more efficient.

24:21.690 --> 24:24.330
- That's crispy, huh?
- I tried my best, Chef.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.200
But in the back of your
head after a challenge,

24:27.230 --> 24:28.470
you're always thinking,

24:28.500 --> 24:30.800
I hope someone did
worse than me.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.770
The pressure got you
tonight, didn't it?

24:32.810 --> 24:34.310
A little bit, Chef. It did.

24:34.340 --> 24:36.710
Because at the end of the day,

24:36.740 --> 24:38.480
you don't have to
outrun the bear,

24:38.510 --> 24:40.910
you just have to outrun
the guy next to you.

24:42.980 --> 24:43.980
Thank you.

24:44.020 --> 24:45.690
Thank you.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.120
Guys, it was a tough
call there tonight.

24:49.160 --> 24:52.560
- Yeah, yeah. - There's one
that's not even a tarte tatin.

24:52.590 --> 24:55.530
I feel everyone really showed
their culinary identity

24:55.560 --> 24:57.560
- with the crème anglaises.
- A couple of the individuals

24:57.600 --> 24:59.370
have got the fruit overcooked.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.370
They're actually
caramelizing it too long.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.970
I think it's pretty clear
who needs to go upstairs

25:03.000 --> 25:05.610
- and stay down.
- Yeah, I'm with you.

25:08.210 --> 25:10.610
- Well done, all of you.
- All: Thank you, Chef.

25:12.210 --> 25:15.650
Some of you baked some
beautiful desserts.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.550
You will not face
elimination tonight.

25:18.590 --> 25:21.350
There was one home
cook that stood out.

25:21.390 --> 25:26.730
This individual executed
a delicious tarte tatin.

25:26.760 --> 25:29.730
The crust on that
pastry is exemplary.

25:31.130 --> 25:34.430
Michael, make your way
up to the balcony.

25:34.470 --> 25:37.100
- Congrats.
- Thank you, guys.

25:37.140 --> 25:38.940
Let's go, boy.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.870
Michael: I feel awesome.

25:41.910 --> 25:43.280
I am the first one called
up to the balcony.

25:43.310 --> 25:45.540
And, honestly, I feel
like I kicked butt.

25:45.580 --> 25:47.950
All right, so the next
person that we felt

25:47.980 --> 25:51.580
really showed some
culinary skill

25:51.620 --> 25:54.020
in interpreting this very
classic French dessert,

25:54.050 --> 25:57.290
- and that is Bri.
- Yay!

25:57.320 --> 25:59.890
- Join your colleagues.
- Thank you.

25:59.930 --> 26:02.390
It feels amazing that
the judges think

26:02.430 --> 26:04.230
that I stand out from the pack,

26:04.260 --> 26:07.100
and I'm so happy to
have that recognition.

26:07.130 --> 26:10.100
The next home cook
continues to excel

26:10.140 --> 26:13.210
and do her state
of Georgia proud.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.610
Dorian continues to wow
us with her desserts.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.610
Good job. Head upstairs, Dorian.

26:18.650 --> 26:21.210
- Congratulations, Liz.
- Yes!

26:21.250 --> 26:23.220
Liz: I went from
having the worst dish

26:23.250 --> 26:25.650
to having the best dish,
and I pulled it off.

26:25.690 --> 26:27.750
I totally pulled off something
I've never made before.

26:27.790 --> 26:29.460
Micah: I'm sweating buckets.

26:29.490 --> 26:31.490
I'm watching everyone
go up to the balcony.

26:31.520 --> 26:34.830
Renee, please head
up to the balcony.

26:34.860 --> 26:37.760
Renee: I am beyond happy.
I nailed it.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.930
Praise Jesus, I am
on the balcony.

26:40.970 --> 26:43.600
- Noah.
- Thank you, Chef!

26:43.640 --> 26:45.500
My heart goes from my
shoes up to my throat.

26:45.540 --> 26:47.770
I'm so nervous. I
just want to be safe.

26:47.810 --> 26:50.140
And the catch of the day...
Jamie, congratulations.

26:50.180 --> 26:52.340
- Go ahead, big fella!
- Whoo!

26:52.380 --> 26:54.450
Sarah: I'm looking around the
room trying to compare it

26:54.480 --> 26:56.680
to other people's, but to me,

26:56.720 --> 26:58.650
I... I just don't
think it's there.

26:58.690 --> 27:01.790
If I go out on this note, like,
why did I even come here?

27:01.820 --> 27:05.090
The last person heading up to
the safety of the balcony,

27:05.120 --> 27:08.090
this individual started
off in the weeds,

27:08.130 --> 27:11.930
but, boy, did they rectify
and come back strong.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.830
The crust is extraordinary.

27:13.870 --> 27:16.500
The cook on the
fruit, mind-blowing.

27:16.540 --> 27:19.710
And I think we want to
see this individual

27:19.740 --> 27:22.270
have a little bit more
confidence about themselves.

27:22.310 --> 27:24.480
Because what they've just done,

27:24.510 --> 27:25.880
is pretty spot-on.

27:25.910 --> 27:29.250
Please make your way
up to the balcony...

27:41.360 --> 27:43.830
The last person heading up to
the safety of the balcony...

27:48.030 --> 27:49.540
Micah.

27:49.570 --> 27:53.210
Man: All right, Micah!

27:53.240 --> 27:55.240
- Yeah, Micah!
- Well done, Micah!

27:55.270 --> 27:56.480
Thank you.

27:56.510 --> 27:59.910
- Man, I'm on cloud ten.
- Good job.

27:59.950 --> 28:01.580
I'm one step closer to
where I want to be.

28:01.610 --> 28:04.150
For those of you remaining,

28:04.180 --> 28:06.720
Joe, Aarón, and myself
need to dig way,

28:06.750 --> 28:08.190
way deeper into your dishes.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.060
Shortly, we have a
huge decision to make.

28:10.090 --> 28:12.830
At least one of you have
cooked for your very last time

28:12.860 --> 28:14.690
- inside this incredible kitchen.
- Wow.

28:14.730 --> 28:17.000
All right, so the
first home cook

28:17.030 --> 28:19.630
that we'd like to bring up and
taste their dish further...

28:22.270 --> 28:25.040
...is Keturah.
Please come on up.

28:29.540 --> 28:31.510
Keturah: Desserts
are my weak point,

28:31.540 --> 28:35.580
and I'm very, very,
very frightened

28:35.610 --> 28:36.950
that this could
be my last hurrah

28:36.980 --> 28:38.890
in the MasterChef kitchen.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.260
Describe the dish, please.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.960
This is a spiced
pineapple tarte tatin,

28:46.990 --> 28:49.030
and a pineapple sauce.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.930
- Keturah, how are you feeling?
- Nervous.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.230
You've got your work cut out...

28:53.270 --> 28:54.530
one of the most
difficult fruits.

28:54.570 --> 28:57.040
So this could send
you home tonight.

28:57.070 --> 28:59.640
When I saw you cut the
pineapple the way you did,

28:59.670 --> 29:02.010
I was relieved that they
were slices, not chunks.

29:12.020 --> 29:13.990
Keturah, I actually love this.

29:14.020 --> 29:17.890
I think you were able to
really do a great job

29:17.920 --> 29:19.890
with cooking the
pineapple in such a way

29:19.930 --> 29:22.130
that it didn't go to
that place of no return.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.000
- Thank you, Chef.
- Joe: It's far from traditional,

29:25.030 --> 29:26.600
but it's well-executed.

29:26.630 --> 29:28.630
It's crunchy, it's buttery.
Really good.

29:28.670 --> 29:32.770
Watching you cook under panic
and stress is interesting

29:32.810 --> 29:36.480
because you get to find out a lot about
yourself when you're vulnerable.

29:36.510 --> 29:39.510
And tonight, it's actually
good to see the real you.

29:39.550 --> 29:43.320
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

29:43.350 --> 29:46.020
- Great job, Keturah.
- Yes.

29:46.050 --> 29:47.290
Sam?

29:47.320 --> 29:50.090
- Go, Sam. Do it, Sam.
- Go, Sam!

29:50.120 --> 29:51.790
Sam: After yesterday,

29:51.820 --> 29:54.530
I really wanted an opportunity
to redeem myself,

29:54.560 --> 29:58.100
but I know I haven't really
done such a good job.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.970
I'm one mistake away
from going home.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.440
Yeah. Sam, describe
the dish, please.

30:03.470 --> 30:05.100
This is a pineapple tarte tatin.

30:05.140 --> 30:07.770
It's flavored with vanilla,
star anise, and cinnamon.

30:07.810 --> 30:10.680
The crème anglaise is flavored
with coconut milk and lime juice.

30:10.710 --> 30:12.680
Did you think of another cut
before you assembled it?

30:12.710 --> 30:15.380
- Or did you want to go chunks?
- No, I wanted to go chunks.

30:15.410 --> 30:17.480
I heard you saying, "If
you're gonna do banana,

30:17.520 --> 30:18.950
do an inch and a half
or two inches thick."

30:18.990 --> 30:20.290
So immediately in
my mind, I think,

30:20.320 --> 30:21.620
"All right, so my
pineapple should be

30:21.650 --> 30:23.220
an inch and a half to
two inches thick."

30:23.260 --> 30:24.720
Completely different fruits.

30:24.760 --> 30:26.890
- So, I would've done rings.
- Understood.

30:26.930 --> 30:29.530
An inch, and cut
the rings in half.

30:33.370 --> 30:35.800
So much liquid here,
it's extraordinary.

30:35.830 --> 30:37.140
Joe: Crème anglaise
is straightforward?

30:37.170 --> 30:38.740
Vanilla? Nothing... no twists?

30:38.770 --> 30:40.640
No, instead of milk,
I used coconut milk

30:40.670 --> 30:42.570
and a little lime juice.

30:48.250 --> 30:50.980
It's disappointing, Sam, 'cause I'm
really equating this to, like,

30:51.020 --> 30:53.490
when you get a pizza that
doesn't have enough cheese,

30:53.520 --> 30:55.590
and then you kind
of swipe it down

30:55.620 --> 30:57.660
and then you're just left with the
bottom of the crust, you know?

30:57.690 --> 30:59.030
That's what I have here.

30:59.060 --> 31:00.430
But what you do have there

31:00.460 --> 31:03.200
is well-seasoned
and well-flavored.

31:03.230 --> 31:07.230
It's just the construction
of it is lacking a lot.

31:07.270 --> 31:10.340
The tops are cut beautifully,
so you've got the top part.

31:10.370 --> 31:12.500
You've just... you've
got your work cut out

31:12.540 --> 31:13.910
when the pineapple's so chunky

31:13.940 --> 31:16.010
because you can't
caramelize a chunk.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.510
The one redeeming factor here

31:18.540 --> 31:21.550
is that I thought the idea
of putting coconut milk

31:21.580 --> 31:24.850
- and pineapple together was really
fantastic. - Thank you, Joe.

31:24.880 --> 31:27.790
- Thank you, Sam.
- Great job, brother.

31:27.820 --> 31:29.090
Tough one.

31:30.420 --> 31:32.220
Next up, Sarah, please.
Let's go.

31:33.990 --> 31:35.560
Sarah: I'm really concerned

31:35.590 --> 31:37.230
about the darkness
on the tarte tatin.

31:37.260 --> 31:39.900
If it's actually burnt,
it's gonna be bitter.

31:39.930 --> 31:43.040
So I'm hoping that
it's not so bad

31:43.070 --> 31:45.200
that I'm out of
this competition.

31:45.240 --> 31:46.740
Describe the dish, please.

31:46.770 --> 31:51.280
I've made for you a peach
and ginger tarte tatin

31:51.310 --> 31:54.650
with a ginger and
vanilla anglaise.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.320
Are you happy with it?

31:56.350 --> 31:59.390
I'm not happy with it, Chef.
I overcooked my caramel.

31:59.420 --> 32:01.350
I'm not proud of
this dish at all.

32:03.090 --> 32:04.090
Mm-hmm.

32:11.430 --> 32:15.100
- Well? - It has a little
petrol-y, acrid situation,

32:15.130 --> 32:17.270
but I think the peaches
are cooked perfectly.

32:17.300 --> 32:19.270
I think your crème
anglaise is beautiful.

32:19.310 --> 32:20.840
- It's silky, it's smooth.
- Here's the thing.

32:20.870 --> 32:25.240
It's just on that
over-caramelized flavor.

32:25.280 --> 32:26.980
It's got that little aftertaste.

32:27.010 --> 32:30.420
It's kind of like the
acidity and caramel-y taste

32:30.450 --> 32:33.490
that you get when you
eat cough syrup.

32:33.520 --> 32:34.750
Thank you, Sarah.

32:34.790 --> 32:37.360
Good job, Sarah. Sarah,
you're all right.

32:37.390 --> 32:39.930
- You're all right, Sarah.
- Good job, Sarah.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.590
As I'm waiting to
hear my name called,

32:42.630 --> 32:45.330
I'm trying to listen very closely
to all the other criticisms.

32:45.360 --> 32:48.830
The judges are being tough, and
that's definitely making me nervous.

32:48.870 --> 32:53.510
- Next, Subha.
- Subha: I'm very nervous.

32:53.540 --> 32:55.710
This could be bad, because
I put an Indian twist

32:55.740 --> 32:58.380
on a very traditional
French dessert.

32:58.410 --> 32:59.950
Describe the dish, please.

32:59.980 --> 33:03.050
The dish is pear and
apple tarte tatin

33:03.080 --> 33:05.450
and a rose flavor
crème anglaise.

33:05.480 --> 33:10.490
So, visually the pears should be turned
the other way. They're upside-down.

33:15.090 --> 33:16.960
Joe: You know what
I love about this

33:17.000 --> 33:19.970
is it has a beautiful
golden hue to it.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.170
Not like Sarah's,
like, super charred.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.040
It has, like, a very
nice color tone to it.

33:25.070 --> 33:27.440
- Aarón: Yeah.
- Beautiful consistency.

33:29.610 --> 33:32.910
I think the true star is that
right there, that crème anglaise.

33:32.940 --> 33:35.380
It's wonderful. I
think, instinctually,

33:35.410 --> 33:38.150
you have a clear vision
with what you want to do.

33:38.180 --> 33:41.550
I just think you need to
back it up with technique.

33:41.590 --> 33:43.890
When you put apple and pear together,
they cook at different times,

33:43.920 --> 33:45.560
so you're shooting yourself
in the foot because

33:45.590 --> 33:47.560
the apple's disintegrated,
but the pear's beautiful.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.860
Here's the bizarre news.

33:49.900 --> 33:52.900
You're like the Willy Wonka
of the MasterChef kitchen.

33:52.930 --> 33:55.270
Rosewater crème
anglaise... it works.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.670
But every time I watch
you cook, it's...

33:57.700 --> 33:59.210
I feel like I've got to go
and lie down for 10 minutes

33:59.240 --> 34:01.710
because you're so confusing.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.580
- Thank you, Subha.
- Thank you, Chef.

34:03.610 --> 34:06.040
Noah: Great job, Subha.
Great job, Subha.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.510
- Good job, Subaru!
- Well done, Subha.

34:07.550 --> 34:10.719
Next tarte tatin, Evan,
please come forward.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.380
- Let's go, Evan.
- Let's go, Evan!

34:12.420 --> 34:15.389
I'm a little worried that it's
maybe a minute or two over,

34:15.420 --> 34:17.090
but if that was in front of me

34:17.120 --> 34:19.060
and I liked apples
and fruity dessert,

34:19.090 --> 34:20.560
I'd probably nick
a bite of that.

34:20.590 --> 34:22.460
- Describe the dish, please.
- I have an apple,

34:22.489 --> 34:24.429
lemon, and ginger tarte tatin

34:24.460 --> 34:27.230
with a thyme anglaise.

34:27.270 --> 34:31.100
So, aesthetically, it
looks like a tarte fine.

34:31.139 --> 34:34.210
It's like you've got puff pastry
with sliced apples on there.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.880
Did you cut the apples
further than half?

34:36.909 --> 34:39.480
No, I cored and
quartered the apples.

34:39.510 --> 34:42.150
- Quartered? Quartered?
- Quartered?

34:42.179 --> 34:44.580
- You half them.
- Like, little slices of apples this big?

34:44.620 --> 34:46.550
I took the halves
and halved them.

34:46.590 --> 34:49.050
- Ah, that's why.
- So, the problem you've got there

34:49.090 --> 34:50.590
is that they'll
never, ever retain

34:50.620 --> 34:52.560
any form of structure
whilst caramelizing.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.830
I didn't cut mine into quarters.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.900
Let's get in there, shall we?

34:56.929 --> 34:59.230
- How long did you cook it for?
- 22 minutes roughly.

34:59.270 --> 35:01.900
22 minutes. So you
quartered the apples

35:01.930 --> 35:04.170
and cooked it longer
than I suggested.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.740
- I didn't have a timer running...
- Right.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.140
...so I just looked
for the color.

35:07.170 --> 35:09.240
Do you often bake
without a timer?

35:09.280 --> 35:11.280
Do you drive without looking
at the speedometer?

35:11.310 --> 35:14.380
I don't drive that often,
living in the city.

35:24.720 --> 35:26.990
Do you often bake
without a timer?

35:27.030 --> 35:28.530
Do you drive without looking
at the speedometer?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.260
I don't drive that often,
living in the city.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.700
Baking is not like making an
omelet or cooking a steak

35:32.730 --> 35:34.600
where you touch it,
and you feel it.

35:34.630 --> 35:36.440
- There's a science to this.
- I had my eye on the clock.

35:36.470 --> 35:38.370
I executed it to the
best of my ability.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.870
The actual crust is way
better than the apples.

35:40.910 --> 35:42.610
The apples are way overcooked.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.480
The problem with this is it's
more like an apple tarte.

35:45.510 --> 35:47.180
- Flat.
- Yeah. It's like a...

35:47.210 --> 35:49.150
Where is the caramel?
Look, there's nothing.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.020
There's no caramel. Nothing.

35:51.050 --> 35:53.390
Where is it? This is
not a tarte tatin.

35:53.420 --> 35:56.360
- This is an apple tarte.
- The whole part of a tarte tatin for me

35:56.390 --> 35:58.520
is that beautiful balance
of having it caramelized

35:58.560 --> 36:00.290
and also having a
little bite to it.

36:00.330 --> 36:02.790
- This has gone the other way.
- It's very simple for me.

36:02.830 --> 36:04.500
It's a very good apple tarte.

36:04.530 --> 36:07.070
It's a very poor
apple tarte tatin.

36:07.100 --> 36:09.340
- Apologies.
- Thanks, Evan.

36:09.370 --> 36:10.940
Great job, Evan.

36:15.710 --> 36:17.310
Fred, please bring
up your tarte tatin.

36:17.340 --> 36:19.080
- Yes, Chef.
- Come on, Fred.

36:19.110 --> 36:22.080
- Come on, Fred.
- Let's go, let's go!

36:22.110 --> 36:24.750
Because I'm the only one in the room
who has made a tarte tatin before,

36:24.780 --> 36:27.190
the judges have much, much
higher expectations of me.

36:27.220 --> 36:28.990
I definitely think if
anything's gonna send me home,

36:29.020 --> 36:30.920
it's gonna be this dish.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.490
- Describe the dish, please.
- For you I have a ginger,

36:33.530 --> 36:35.990
vanilla, and cinnamon
infused apple tarte tatin

36:36.030 --> 36:38.360
with a brown butter and
cardamom crème anglaise.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.830
Well, obviously, it's raw
here, it's caramelized here.

36:40.870 --> 36:43.670
It's imbalanced, it's kind of...
structurally, it fell apart.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.900
That's not what we wanted.

36:57.720 --> 37:01.750
You were the only home cook
that's made a tarte tatin before

37:01.790 --> 37:04.190
and I can't see that here.

37:04.220 --> 37:07.130
For me, it's applesauce.
I don't like it at all.

37:07.160 --> 37:08.960
It's not the cake we wanted.

37:08.990 --> 37:10.860
I disagree. I like the flavor.
You've got that right.

37:10.900 --> 37:13.800
Unfortunately, it
doesn't look decent.

37:13.830 --> 37:15.970
Personally, I expected
more from you tonight.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.470
I expected more
from myself, Chef.

37:17.500 --> 37:18.940
Thank you.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.940
- Good job, Fred.
- Good job, Fred!

37:20.970 --> 37:23.710
Stand tall. Stay focused.

37:23.740 --> 37:27.650
Excuse us, as we need a moment to
discuss this very important matter.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.780
Thank you.

37:29.820 --> 37:31.980
Fred: I feel like I failed.

37:32.020 --> 37:33.590
After hearing the
judges' critiques,

37:33.620 --> 37:35.550
I'm basically saying my
good-byes to everyone.

37:35.590 --> 37:37.560
I already am trying to envision

37:37.590 --> 37:39.560
what my life was before
this competition

37:39.590 --> 37:41.960
because I'm expecting that
I have to go back to it.

37:41.990 --> 37:44.400
Some standouts again,
without a doubt.

37:44.430 --> 37:47.930
It's just really deciding
whose was worse.

37:47.970 --> 37:49.640
I think it's pretty obvious
who the weakest one is, yeah?

37:49.670 --> 37:52.370
- Ready?
- Yeah.

37:55.310 --> 37:56.410
All six of you, please make
your way down to the front.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.480
Thank you.

37:58.940 --> 38:01.780
Going home would
literally be shocking.

38:01.810 --> 38:03.180
I don't want to go home.

38:03.210 --> 38:04.320
I want to live till tomorrow

38:04.350 --> 38:05.580
to be able to cook again.

38:05.620 --> 38:08.990
This one was tough for us.

38:09.020 --> 38:14.290
Sarah and Keturah,
please step forward.

38:14.330 --> 38:16.960
Both of you girls
struggled this evening.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.630
Nice to see that you
could come back.

38:19.670 --> 38:25.870
In fact, the comeback was just
enough to retain your white aprons.

38:25.900 --> 38:29.510
- Go on upstairs.
- Let's go, girls! Let's go, girls!

38:31.240 --> 38:32.780
Sarah: I was just saying prayers

38:32.810 --> 38:34.210
that they weren't
gonna send me home,

38:34.250 --> 38:37.320
and, uh, I'm still here.

38:37.350 --> 38:41.850
The positive of this
experience has been

38:41.890 --> 38:43.960
I've learned that it's
okay to be vulnerable.

38:43.990 --> 38:48.960
But I don't ever want to
see a black apron again.

38:48.990 --> 38:51.230
Subha, please step forward.

38:53.900 --> 38:57.070
Subha, to be very honest, I think
you made some fundamental mistakes,

38:57.100 --> 39:01.670
but you continue to
put your background

39:01.710 --> 39:03.810
into your dishes, and
we can taste it.

39:03.840 --> 39:07.010
We felt that it was
just good enough

39:07.050 --> 39:09.580
- for you to retain your apron.
- Let's go, Subha!

39:09.620 --> 39:13.320
- Please head upstairs.
- Good luck, guys. Good luck, good luck.

39:13.350 --> 39:17.590
- Good job, buddy.
- Fred, Sam, Evan,

39:17.620 --> 39:19.260
clearly you three are at
the bottom of the barrel.

39:19.290 --> 39:21.430
And, Fred, a lackluster
performance,

39:21.460 --> 39:23.060
especially when
you're the only one

39:23.090 --> 39:24.160
in the room this evening
who had done this before.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.760
Sam, you know,

39:25.800 --> 39:27.700
the crust was delicious,

39:27.730 --> 39:30.440
but it was literally
swimming in water.

39:30.470 --> 39:32.700
Evan, you didn't put
your spin on it,

39:32.740 --> 39:34.440
you completely changed the dish.

39:34.470 --> 39:35.840
This is a tough call.

39:35.870 --> 39:38.340
The person leaving "MasterChef,"

39:38.380 --> 39:40.010
not entering the top 16

39:40.050 --> 39:44.250
of this incredible
competition is...

39:46.280 --> 39:47.390
Evan.

39:49.890 --> 39:52.520
Fred, Sam, move it. Up
to the balcony, quick.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.190
- I'm so sorry, Evan.
- It's all good, guys.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.200
Fred: I am trying to learn,

40:00.230 --> 40:02.070
which I think is
probably the one reason

40:02.100 --> 40:03.400
why they saved me over Evan.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.400
Evan, to become America's
next MasterChef,

40:05.440 --> 40:08.310
we need an incredible pupil.

40:08.340 --> 40:09.910
There's times across
this competition

40:09.940 --> 40:13.650
that you have been so difficult
about taking advice.

40:13.680 --> 40:17.780
Yeah, I think your knowledge and
your love of food is apparent, Evan,

40:17.820 --> 40:20.550
and I hope you can take that with
whatever you do in your food career,

40:20.590 --> 40:22.490
'cause I know it's
gonna be there.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.390
- Thank you.
- Please place your apron on your bench.

40:25.420 --> 40:27.230
Good night.

40:27.260 --> 40:29.130
Evan: In the end,
it doesn't matter.

40:29.160 --> 40:32.000
I still feel like my experience
and my knowledge base

40:32.030 --> 40:34.230
means that I was the best
chef in this competition.

40:34.270 --> 40:36.670
This is not the end of
my culinary journey.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.770
This is just the beginning.
