01:27.053 --> 01:29.288
Idiot.

02:17.403 --> 02:19.905
Ah, Mr. karim.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.109
I wanted to speak to you
about the carpets

02:24.111 --> 02:25.644
we sent
to the British exhibition.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.979
There is a problem, sir?

02:26.981 --> 02:29.014
No, no! The carpets went down
very well.

02:29.016 --> 02:32.017
In fact, the governor general
has received a letter

02:32.019 --> 02:34.419
from the royal household
thanking him personally.

02:34.421 --> 02:38.290
It's all been such a success,
he has, uh, decided to present

02:38.292 --> 02:42.094
the queen with a mohur
as part of the jubilee.

02:42.096 --> 02:43.495
A mohur, sir?

02:43.497 --> 02:47.432
A mohur. Apparently,
some sort of ceremonial coin.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.536
I have been asked to find
someone tall to present it.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.104
You're the tallest person here.

02:52.106 --> 02:54.606
When will she be arriving, sir?

02:54.608 --> 02:57.976
Not in agra.
In england.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.045
You will travel to england

03:00.047 --> 03:04.349
and present the mohur
at an official function.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.985
Like an equerry.

03:06.987 --> 03:10.155
-On a horse? -Oh, I... I don't
think there'll be a horse.

03:10.157 --> 03:14.293
--An equerry always
has a horse, Mr. Tyler, sir.

03:14.295 --> 03:18.297
Well, maybe not
like an equerry exactly.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.502
-Morning.
-Ah, morning.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.337
This is major bigge,

03:25.339 --> 03:28.574
extra groom-in-waiting
to the royal household windsor,

03:28.576 --> 03:30.809
who will be in charge
of your journey.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.878
-This is Abdul.
-Top hole.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.047
And this is Mohammed,

03:35.049 --> 03:37.816
who will also be presenting
the mohur.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.821
He's very short.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.090
We had to swap him
at the last moment.

03:45.092 --> 03:48.827
The tall chap had an accident
with an elephant.

04:05.778 --> 04:08.847
Good morning, your majesty.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.551
<i> At the head</i>

04:12.553 --> 04:14.620
is the lord Chamberlain
and the private secretary,

04:14.622 --> 04:16.887
the deputy private secretary,
the ladies-in-waiting,

04:16.890 --> 04:19.690
the upper servants,
the lower-upper servants.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.226
Then the members
of the household.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.694
One--
the head of the bedchamber.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.895
Two-- the personal
head of staff.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.397
Three-- the Butler-in-chief,

04:25.399 --> 04:27.866
who is in charge of the
household Butler, the kitchen

04:27.868 --> 04:30.068
factotum, the head chef,
the head of waiting staff,

04:30.070 --> 04:33.705
the ordinary waiting staff,
windsor, the table maids,

04:33.707 --> 04:34.973
then you.
Any questions?

04:34.975 --> 04:37.876
Uh-huh. Who will have
the mohur, sir?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.544
I'm not exactly sure as yet.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.913
I suspect you'll both carry it
on a cushion.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.448
Do we both get a cushion?

04:43.450 --> 04:45.050
I really don't know.

04:45.052 --> 04:48.553
The key to good service
is standing still

04:48.555 --> 04:50.222
and moving backwards.

04:50.224 --> 04:54.526
The most important thing is
you must not look at her.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.143
Have you any idea

05:11.145 --> 05:13.812
how cold it is in england?
We're gonna die there.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.414
Why did you agree to come?

05:15.416 --> 05:16.982
The tall one fell off
an elephant.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.483
I wasn't given a choice.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.453
Ugh! 5,000 miles
to present a bloody medal

05:21.455 --> 05:23.755
to the oppressor of the entire
Indian subcontinent.

05:23.757 --> 05:27.426
You don't realize what
a great honor this is for us.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.494
Have you ever tasted
English food?

05:29.496 --> 05:32.164
-They eat pig's blood.
-They do not eat pig's blood.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.933
I'm telling you, they put
pig's blood in the sausages

05:34.935 --> 05:36.535
and brains of sheep.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.103
- Ugh.

05:38.105 --> 05:41.940
Place is completely barbaric.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.386
Give me some money?

05:54.388 --> 05:56.321
Please, sir?

05:56.323 --> 05:58.824
-Civilization!
-Please, sir.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.392
Give us a farthing.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.461
Give us a farthing, sir.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.963
Arms.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.201
<i> Arms.</i>

06:09.203 --> 06:13.004
We copied them
from some drawings

06:13.006 --> 06:15.540
-in the British museum.
-Splendid!

06:15.542 --> 06:18.043
You do know a sash
is not traditional, sir?

06:18.045 --> 06:22.214
The Indian drawings didn't
look very... Indian,

06:22.216 --> 06:24.750
so we made some innovations.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.985
The important thing is
to look...

06:26.987 --> 06:30.255
-Authentic.
-Looks jolly good to me.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.690
<i> Jubilee celebrations.</i>

06:31.692 --> 06:33.525
<i> 9:00-- breakfast in London.</i>

<i> the junior undersecretary</i>
<i> of state for</i>

<i> Half past 6:00--</i>

07:09.062 --> 07:10.695
Come on, men!
Chop-chop!

07:10.697 --> 07:13.031
<i> And the ceremonial</i>
<i> presentation</i>

07:13.033 --> 07:15.534
<i> of a mohur.</i>

07:20.973 --> 07:23.475
The hindus, sir.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.214
But they're completely
different sizes.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.883
There was an incident, sir,
with an elephant.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.719
Hmm. The queen arrives.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.555
Fanfares,

07:36.557 --> 07:39.458
ceremonial entrance.

07:39.460 --> 07:43.128
The royal entourage
make their way to the table

07:43.130 --> 07:45.630
to be seated thus.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.098
Her majesty.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.100
Sir Henry ponsonby,
private secretary.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.569
The secretary of state
for India.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.405
The emperor of Russia,
Dr. Reid, lady Churchill,

07:53.407 --> 07:56.074
miss phipps,
et cetera, et cetera. Grace.

07:56.076 --> 08:01.246
Soup-- potage Saint-germain
with purée de Madeleine.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.782
Fish course--
morue aux huîtres.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.584
Fanfare.

08:05.586 --> 08:10.088
Entrée-- quenelle with regency
sauce, et cetera, et cetera.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.524
Dessert-- pain d'épinards,

08:12.526 --> 08:15.527
tartelettes à la suisse,
profiteroles.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.162
Always profiteroles.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.599
You will come from
the northwest service entrance.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.933
Process together.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.002
And you will stand here.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.104
No. A little bit...

08:26.106 --> 08:27.939
That's it.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.941
Presenting the tray thus.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.177
Tray?

08:32.179 --> 08:34.312
But I thought
it was a cushion.

08:34.313 --> 08:37.515
- You will present the tray...
- Excuse me?

08:37.518 --> 08:38.850
Do I get a tray?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.217
No, we've only got one tray.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.153
Uh-oh. So what do I do?

08:42.155 --> 08:44.322
You'll just have to improvise.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.791
Whatever you do, you must
not look at her majesty.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.126
You will bow again.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.828
Then moving backwards,

08:49.830 --> 08:52.564
you will turn to your left,
you will lead thus,

08:52.566 --> 08:53.999
and you will process

08:54.001 --> 08:58.203
down the hall
to be met by Mr. bigge,

08:58.205 --> 09:01.339
who will walk you
to the north wall,

09:01.341 --> 09:04.643
where you will stand
till the end of the meal.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.546
Would you like me
to run through that again?

09:07.548 --> 09:09.848
Mr. yorke,
she's heading to Paddington!

09:09.850 --> 09:11.249
Everybody out!

09:11.251 --> 09:13.518
You two-- stairs, now!

09:22.763 --> 09:27.832
- Jesus Christ, where are the...
Quenelles? -

09:27.834 --> 09:30.168
oi, you two--

09:30.170 --> 09:31.403
out of it!

09:31.405 --> 09:33.004
She's at the station, sir!

09:33.006 --> 09:35.440
- Jesus h. Christ, she's at
the... station? -

09:35.442 --> 09:38.843
for god's sake,
just wait where you were told.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.845
Open the doors.

09:40.847 --> 09:45.016
Open the doors!
Open the doors!

09:45.018 --> 09:47.485
Open the doors!

09:58.397 --> 10:01.266
-Really it's beautiful.
-Beautiful.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.055
She's here.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.958
Soup.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.660
Soup!

10:28.662 --> 10:32.397
Soup! Soup!

10:32.399 --> 10:35.934
Soup...!

10:35.936 --> 10:38.737
Soup!

11:33.793 --> 11:36.327
Oh, thank heavens.

11:41.167 --> 11:44.335
Soup, your majesty.

12:05.057 --> 12:08.326
Oh. What,
are you taking it all?

12:08.328 --> 12:10.829
I'm still...

12:12.098 --> 12:13.765
I haven't finished yet.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.667
I-I'm afraid
you have to be quick.

12:15.669 --> 12:18.236
They take it off you
as soon as she's done.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.871
One down, six to go.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.840
The morue aux huîtres,
and then the quenelle.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.042
Yes, sir.
The morue aux huîtres,

12:24.044 --> 12:26.177
-and then the quenelle.
-This is bloody ridiculous.

12:26.179 --> 12:29.848
Two months in a boat,
and I haven't even got a tray?

12:32.451 --> 12:36.454
Yes. Apparently,
you have to chew it 32 times.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.641
Oh.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.956
I have the mohur.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.292
Is that it?

13:18.965 --> 13:20.732
Your majesty?

13:22.736 --> 13:25.637
Your majesty?

13:25.639 --> 13:29.574
The, uh... the profiteroles.

13:49.696 --> 13:52.197
Is that it?

13:52.199 --> 13:53.765
Profiteroles have gone.

13:53.767 --> 13:56.534
Gentlemen, process,
turn, bow, present,

13:56.536 --> 13:59.470
and absolutely
no eye contact whatsoever.

14:42.514 --> 14:45.583
A gift from the Indian empire.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.086
A mohur, your majesty.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.188
A what?

14:50.190 --> 14:52.490
A mughal coin, your majesty,

14:52.492 --> 14:55.894
in honor of your service
to the, uh, subcontinent.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.731
Have we finished?

14:59.733 --> 15:02.734
Uh, we still have coffee,
uh, your majesty.

15:31.530 --> 15:34.032
Eyes!

15:47.547 --> 15:50.949
Good morning, your majesty.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.651
<i> Breakfast with the</i>
<i> royal princes of Belgium.</i>

15:53.653 --> 15:56.554
<i> 11:00-- an audience</i>
<i> with the sultan of Dubai</i>

15:56.556 --> 15:58.489
<i> where her majesty</i>
<i> will be presented</i>

15:58.491 --> 16:00.558
<i> with the diamond of ooojay.</i>

16:00.560 --> 16:03.161
<i> Garden party where her majesty</i>
<i> will receive</i>

16:03.163 --> 16:06.230
Oscar ii, king of Sweden
and Norway, again

16:06.232 --> 16:08.566
and queen liliuokalani.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.668
Who on earth is she?

16:10.670 --> 16:13.171
A monarch and, uh,
sole queen regnant

16:13.173 --> 16:15.073
of the kingdom of Hawaii,
your majesty.

16:15.075 --> 16:19.077
Uh, she has composed a song
for you on the ukulele.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.846
Uh, but we have managed
to put her off.

16:21.848 --> 16:24.248
Then you will eat
with the prime minister,

16:24.250 --> 16:28.519
and at 7:00 the banquet
in the state dining room.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.422
And your movements,
your majesty?

16:31.424 --> 16:33.458
Nothing to speak of, Dr. Reid.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.860
Not even during the day?

16:35.862 --> 16:38.162
We last moved
on Sunday evening.

16:39.865 --> 16:41.632
I fear the celebratory dinners

16:41.634 --> 16:43.101
are taking their toll,
your majesty.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.803
Might I suggest
some benger's mixture?

16:45.805 --> 16:48.539
I refuse to eat benger's.
It's baby food.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.309
But it is imperative,
your majesty,

16:51.311 --> 16:54.545
that the royal colon receives
a little roughage.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.214
Anything else?

16:56.216 --> 16:59.117
Um, now,
was your majesty pleased

16:59.119 --> 17:01.886
-with the mohur?
-What?

17:01.888 --> 17:03.955
With the mohur,
the ceremonial coin.

17:03.957 --> 17:09.827
Uh, presented
by the two Indian servants.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.930
I thought the tall one
was terribly handsome.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.320
Stop!

17:42.661 --> 17:45.863
Slight change of plan.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.499
You must not talk
to any of the guests.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.901
Nod or bow,

17:49.903 --> 17:53.237
but please do not
interact with anybody

17:53.239 --> 17:54.839
other than the serving staff.

17:54.841 --> 17:58.443
I will come to you
when the queen is seated,

17:58.445 --> 18:00.411
and you will present

18:00.413 --> 18:03.181
the royal pudding,
as requested.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.216
Uh, excuse me, sir,

18:05.218 --> 18:06.417
but what is it?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.052
That is a jelly.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.354
A pudding made
from the liquor of fruit.

18:10.356 --> 18:11.789
How do they get it so stiff?

18:11.791 --> 18:15.126
Gelatin, a by-product
of cow bone.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.600
There's another famine
in India.

18:22.602 --> 18:26.037
More trouble in Ireland,
I'm afraid.

18:26.039 --> 18:28.606
Suez is a perennial nightmare,
and I'm afraid

18:28.608 --> 18:30.541
the boers are at it again.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.376
Is there any good news,
prime minister?

18:32.378 --> 18:33.644
Uh, well, we've decided

18:33.646 --> 18:35.446
to annex zululand,
your majesty.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.647
Whatever for?

18:36.649 --> 18:38.382
We really
have to box in the boers

18:38.384 --> 18:40.218
-if we possibly can, -oh,
prime minister, you really are

18:40.220 --> 18:42.386
-your ma-- your majesty.
-Terribly depressing.

18:42.388 --> 18:43.588
Yes.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.157
Ah, sandwiches. Mmm.

18:53.932 --> 18:56.601
Splendid.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.336
-Oh, wonderful.
-Oh, that's wonderful.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.239
Oh.

19:05.444 --> 19:07.645
Splendid.

19:10.415 --> 19:12.016
Jelly, your majesty.

19:35.607 --> 19:38.943
I suddenly feel
a great deal better.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.378
<i> What the hell</i>

19:40.380 --> 19:41.679
were you thinking?!

19:41.681 --> 19:43.214
You said,
"present the jelly," sir.

19:43.216 --> 19:46.217
I didn't say kiss the feet
of the empress of India!

19:46.219 --> 19:48.119
I-i thought
it would cheer her up.

19:48.121 --> 19:49.387
Cheer her up?

19:49.389 --> 19:51.389
They'll have me
court-martialed.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.525
What on earth is going on?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.527
Her majesty has requested

19:56.529 --> 20:00.298
Mr. karim and Mr. baksh...

20:00.300 --> 20:03.067
Be her personal footmen

20:03.069 --> 20:06.871
for the rest of the jubilee.

20:14.313 --> 20:15.713
Ah, gentlemen.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.248
Uh, you can wait here
by the door.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.983
Her majesty wants you
to stand in here,

20:18.985 --> 20:20.251
by the writing desk.

20:20.253 --> 20:23.054
Go on.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.127
Thank you.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.732
You may go.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.235
Oh, thank you,
uh, your majesty.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.873
Don't worry.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.042
I'm not going to eat you.

20:45.044 --> 20:49.180
"Dr. Reid...

20:49.182 --> 20:52.383
"A very...

20:52.385 --> 20:54.685
"Successful...

20:54.687 --> 20:58.456
"Movement...

20:58.458 --> 21:01.425
"At 8:00...

21:01.427 --> 21:03.027
This morning."

21:04.696 --> 21:06.998
What the hell
is going on in there?

21:15.707 --> 21:17.308
Thank you, Mr....

21:17.310 --> 21:19.644
Abdul.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.345
Abdul karim.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.889
I am always writing.

21:34.559 --> 21:35.926
I-in India, I'm writing

21:35.928 --> 21:38.062
a-all day, every day.

21:38.064 --> 21:41.065
So, in India,
you are not a servant?

21:41.067 --> 21:44.502
No. In India, I'm writing
in my very big book.

21:44.504 --> 21:45.736
You're writing a book?

21:45.738 --> 21:47.905
Yes.
I'm writing every name,

21:47.907 --> 21:49.674
who they are,
what they have done.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.575
This is my life.

21:51.577 --> 21:53.010
Every day, I'm writing,

21:53.012 --> 21:54.945
from morning to night.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.747
-And is this fiction?
-No.

21:56.749 --> 21:59.784
It is the very truth.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.285
I don't understand.

22:01.287 --> 22:03.587
If you are an author,
why are you here,

22:03.589 --> 22:05.856
uh, presenting me with the m...
Uh, with the m...

22:05.858 --> 22:07.158
Mo-mohur.

22:08.593 --> 22:11.529
It is my humble privilege
to serve her majesty.

22:18.704 --> 22:20.905
I was the one
who chose your carpets.

22:22.774 --> 22:24.008
Carpets?

22:24.010 --> 22:26.444
Yes. The viceroy
asked Mr. Tyler, sir,

22:26.446 --> 22:28.379
but actually, it was me.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.381
Y-you have to have
a very good eye

22:30.383 --> 22:31.782
for the carpets.

22:31.784 --> 22:35.519
Uh, like... this is
a very nice one, for example.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.822
Very, very tight knots.

22:37.824 --> 22:40.458
The art of carpets,
uh, came to India

22:40.460 --> 22:44.628
from persia
with the great emperor akbar.

22:44.630 --> 22:47.498
The s-skill of a carpet

22:47.500 --> 22:50.568
is to bring all the different
kinds of threads together

22:50.570 --> 22:54.405
and weave something
we can all stand on.

22:54.407 --> 22:58.042
You seem to know
a great deal about it.

22:58.044 --> 23:01.979
My family were carpet makers,

23:01.981 --> 23:04.582
but now I write in the book.

23:04.584 --> 23:06.817
Life is like a carpet.

23:06.819 --> 23:10.921
We weave in and out
to make a pattern.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.492
That is a very beautiful image.

23:16.561 --> 23:17.762
Look.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.830
Here is the bird of freedom

23:19.832 --> 23:22.600
caught forever in the design.

23:26.238 --> 23:30.341
So, in India, you are a poet?

23:30.343 --> 23:31.509
No.

23:31.511 --> 23:34.278
In India, I make
a ledger of the prisoners.

23:36.114 --> 23:39.417
We are all prisoners,
Mr. karim.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.419
Apparently, he's a poet.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.743
These people are the exploiters

24:05.745 --> 24:07.545
of a quarter of all of mankind.

24:07.547 --> 24:11.081
Do you really think
they give a hoot about us, huh?

24:11.083 --> 24:13.617
We'll bloody well freeze
to death at this rate.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.052
Cut all the nicey-nicey crap,

24:15.054 --> 24:16.821
and let's get
the hell out of here.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.389
Agreed?

24:18.391 --> 24:19.657
I promise.

24:19.659 --> 24:22.293
Good night.

24:33.004 --> 24:35.039
Will you stop doing that?

24:42.747 --> 24:44.782
You realize...

24:44.784 --> 24:47.718
This is the third day in a row.

24:51.923 --> 24:54.625
So, Mr. Abdul,

24:54.627 --> 24:56.026
may I ask

24:56.028 --> 24:58.863
what part of India you're from?

24:58.865 --> 25:00.931
Uh, I'm from agra.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.766
The... the Taj Mahal?

25:02.768 --> 25:04.368
You have been to the Taj Mahal?

25:04.370 --> 25:05.503
No.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.304
Oh, it is
the most marvelous building

25:07.306 --> 25:09.874
in the entire world,
your majesty.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.476
The crown of palaces.

25:12.478 --> 25:15.479
It was built by shah jahan
to remember his dead wife,

25:15.481 --> 25:19.617
uh, who died at childbirth
during their 14th child.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.051
Goodness.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.953
He was so upset with grief,

25:22.955 --> 25:24.655
he brought
the greatest architects

25:24.657 --> 25:26.824
from persia,

25:26.826 --> 25:28.225
uh, Afghanistan,

25:28.227 --> 25:30.294
to build the Taj Mahal.

25:30.296 --> 25:33.197
It certainly sounds
a handsome building.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.132
I'd very much like to see it.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.800
Oh, it is beautiful,
your majesty.

25:36.802 --> 25:39.136
Uh, it's all white marble.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.839
All that beauty
for the dead queen.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.141
Hmm. How romantic.

25:44.143 --> 25:47.077
Shah jahan also built
the red fort, uh,

25:47.079 --> 25:50.014
the gardens of shalimar,
the peacock throne.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.649
The peacock throne?

25:51.651 --> 25:54.318
It is the most beautiful
throne in all the world.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.721
And inside the throne
was the kohinoor.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.291
But I have the kohinoor.
I wear it as a brooch.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.360
-Do you?
-Yes.

26:03.362 --> 26:06.297
It wasn't very shiny,
so Albert had it recut.

26:07.599 --> 26:09.667
What happened
to the peacock throne?

26:09.669 --> 26:11.035
They smashed it up.

26:11.037 --> 26:13.170
How awful.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.172
They're always
smashing things up.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.675
The British soldiers
have taken the jewels

26:17.677 --> 26:18.842
from the Taj Mahal.

26:18.844 --> 26:20.778
British soldiers?

26:20.780 --> 26:22.746
Oh, yes, after the mutiny.

26:23.949 --> 26:25.950
But this is terrible.

26:25.952 --> 26:29.219
What can they be talking about?

26:29.221 --> 26:31.055
A servant and an Indian.

26:31.057 --> 26:33.023
Yeah, what on earth
does she see in him?

26:33.025 --> 26:35.225
Well...

26:35.227 --> 26:37.428
He is rather handsome.

26:39.030 --> 26:42.266
What happened to shah jahan?

26:42.268 --> 26:44.401
He was overthrown by his son

26:44.403 --> 26:46.804
and died in agra fort.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.139
The wickedness of children.

26:49.141 --> 26:51.375
They buried him
in the Taj Mahal

26:51.377 --> 26:53.444
with his wife, mumtaz.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.813
They also wrote an inscription.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.948
Uh, "here lies shah jahan,

26:57.950 --> 26:59.383
"who left this world

26:59.385 --> 27:01.986
for the banquet hall
of eternity."

27:01.988 --> 27:04.154
The banquet hall of eternity--

27:04.156 --> 27:06.423
I rather like that idea.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.626
You seem very well-informed.

27:08.628 --> 27:11.629
Ah, these are famous stories
of uttar pradesh.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.897
-You should go there.
-Oh, I can never go there.

27:13.899 --> 27:15.599
-I'm forbidden.
-Forbidden?

27:15.601 --> 27:17.835
They fear
i would be assassinated.

27:17.837 --> 27:21.338
So, you have never
seen a Indian street?

27:21.340 --> 27:24.241
-Or a stall of spices?
-No.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.443
Oh. Oh, the spices.

27:26.445 --> 27:29.313
Uh, cumin, coriander,

27:29.315 --> 27:30.581
garam masala.

27:30.583 --> 27:33.250
Garam masa...
What is garam masala?

27:33.252 --> 27:35.252
It is what you put
into the sauce.

27:35.254 --> 27:38.489
You have never tasted
Indian food?

27:39.658 --> 27:42.159
Dal. Rogan Josh.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.194
Biryani with mango chutney.

27:44.196 --> 27:46.497
- Mango chutney?

27:46.499 --> 27:48.866
Chutney made out of mango.

27:48.868 --> 27:51.435
What is mango?

27:51.437 --> 27:53.804
Mango is the queen of fruit.

27:53.806 --> 27:56.940
What does it taste like?

27:56.942 --> 27:59.543
Like, uh, an orange

27:59.545 --> 28:01.712
and a peach.

28:01.714 --> 28:03.714
Hmm.

28:04.949 --> 28:06.850
Sir Henry.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.385
I would like a mango.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.987
-A mango?
-Yes.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.955
I would like to taste a mango.

28:11.957 --> 28:13.524
That's
impossible, your majesty.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.526
Uh, they only grow in India.

28:15.528 --> 28:16.994
Well, I'm empress of India.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.429
So have one sent.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.317
Here!

28:46.758 --> 28:48.092
Your majesty?

28:48.094 --> 28:49.560
Oh.

28:49.562 --> 28:52.496
Thank you.
Wait, another.

28:52.498 --> 28:56.433
Thank you.

28:57.769 --> 29:00.671
How do you like
your new Scottish costumes?

29:00.673 --> 29:03.107
They're very scratchy,
your majesty.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.442
Everything in Scotland
is scratchy.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.679
Sir Henry?

29:10.415 --> 29:12.015
When does bertie arrive?

29:12.017 --> 29:13.517
Uh, tomorrow, your majesty.

29:13.519 --> 29:15.986
Uh, he's on his way from,
uh, monte Carlo.

29:19.257 --> 29:23.293
It's all right for her.
Sh-she's upholstered.

29:38.443 --> 29:41.378
Oh, god, I hate Scotland!

29:52.123 --> 29:53.657
Ah.

29:53.659 --> 29:55.259
Uh, you must be the hindus.

29:55.261 --> 29:57.895
Very nice to meet you.

29:57.897 --> 30:00.164
You must be the hindus.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.966
You... must...

30:02.968 --> 30:06.970
Be... the hindus.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.742
More, more,

30:11.744 --> 30:15.078
more! More.

30:20.118 --> 30:23.821
I wish she'd bloody well
go to bed.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.658
Hey!

30:43.942 --> 30:46.009
Good morning, your majesty.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.312
The boxes, your majesty.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.713
Thank you.

30:49.715 --> 30:52.115
And the, uh, the blank journal

30:52.117 --> 30:54.084
your majesty requested.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.059
You may go.

31:02.061 --> 31:05.562
I'm perfectly capable
of working through the boxes.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.498
Abdul is very helpful
with his blotter.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.634
But these are parliamentary
papers, your majesty.

31:10.636 --> 31:11.969
I'm aware of that.

31:11.971 --> 31:14.371
But Abdul is a servant.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.673
He cannot assist
with the boxes.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.675
And I am the queen of england.

31:18.677 --> 31:22.079
I will have whatever help
i require with the boxes.

31:31.389 --> 31:32.990
And, sir Henry,

31:32.992 --> 31:34.992
would you get some gloves
for the hindus?

31:34.994 --> 31:37.094
They're suffering terribly
from the cold.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.672
He's helping her
with the boxes.

31:48.674 --> 31:52.042
I want you to teach me Indian.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.543
Indian?

31:53.545 --> 31:56.146
Hindu or whatever
it is you speak.

31:57.348 --> 31:58.916
A-are you sure?

31:58.918 --> 32:00.183
Of course I'm sure.

32:00.185 --> 32:01.518
But why would you like

32:01.520 --> 32:03.353
to learn hindi, your majesty?

32:03.355 --> 32:05.355
Well, I'm empress of India.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.691
Look. I've ordered a book.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.861
I want you
to give me private lessons.

32:10.863 --> 32:13.864
I can't teach you hindi,
your majesty.

32:13.866 --> 32:15.132
Why ever not?

32:15.134 --> 32:16.700
You are the empress of India.

32:16.702 --> 32:18.936
You should learn urdu,

32:18.938 --> 32:20.137
language of the mughals.

32:20.139 --> 32:23.540
There are a thousand
languages in India, uh,

32:23.542 --> 32:26.043
but urdu is the most noble.

32:26.045 --> 32:27.411
May...

32:27.413 --> 32:29.546
In hindi,

32:29.548 --> 32:33.250
you write like this.

32:33.252 --> 32:34.785
Hmm.

32:34.787 --> 32:38.055
Huh? But in urdu, you write

32:38.057 --> 32:41.291
like this.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.293
"Main rani hoon."

32:43.295 --> 32:44.728
"I am the queen."

32:44.730 --> 32:45.929
I see.

32:45.931 --> 32:47.998
Oh.

32:50.301 --> 32:54.071
-Main.
-Main...

32:54.073 --> 32:55.605
-Rani...
-Main...

32:55.607 --> 32:58.575
Rani... rani...

32:58.577 --> 33:00.277
Hoon. Hoon.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.012
...hoon.

33:02.014 --> 33:03.347
Hoon.

33:03.349 --> 33:04.648
-Hoo...
-Hoon, hoon, hoon.

33:04.650 --> 33:08.018
He's teaching her hindu.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.920
Is that allowed?

33:11.423 --> 33:13.290
I think you will find
it is urdu.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.359
--The Muslim version.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.260
Oh, my goodness me.

33:17.262 --> 33:19.529
Rani hoon.

33:19.531 --> 33:20.964
That's it.

33:22.267 --> 33:24.267
"You are the queen."

33:24.269 --> 33:28.171
The queen is very wise. Hmm?

33:30.642 --> 33:33.110
-Rani...
-Rani...

33:33.112 --> 33:34.277
...kaafi...

33:34.279 --> 33:38.115
Akalmand...

33:38.117 --> 33:39.950
Hain.

33:39.952 --> 33:41.284
You see?

33:41.286 --> 33:43.620
Now you write it down.

33:50.128 --> 33:52.295
-Rani...
-Rani...

33:52.297 --> 33:54.464
Kaafi...

33:54.466 --> 33:56.333
Akalmand.

33:56.335 --> 33:59.770
...akal...

34:02.240 --> 34:04.474
She's writing in her journal.

34:04.476 --> 34:07.644
And she's speaking
in hindustani.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.380
No, it's urdu, actually.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.583
The-the Muslim version.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.888
Akalmandi pe rani

34:17.889 --> 34:20.424
-ko naaz hai.
-Ko naaz hai.

34:20.426 --> 34:23.427
Uh, "apni." "Ni."

34:23.429 --> 34:25.161
-"Ni." Uh, uh, knee.
-A...

34:25.164 --> 34:26.862
-Knee. Knee.
-Knee.

34:26.864 --> 34:28.665
- Apni. Apni.
-Ye...

34:28.667 --> 34:30.266
Oh. Ap... apn...

34:30.268 --> 34:32.069
Apni akalmandi

34:32.071 --> 34:34.004
pe rani ko naaz hai.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.304
- Yes. Yes.

34:38.376 --> 34:40.744
"Shukriya, Abdul.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.346
"Tum behtreen

34:43.348 --> 34:44.681
munshi ho."

34:44.683 --> 34:46.449
"Thank you, Abdul.

34:46.452 --> 34:50.020
You are
an excellent teacher."

34:53.391 --> 34:55.391
-Bertie.
-Mother.

34:55.393 --> 34:56.726
Were you spying on me?

34:56.728 --> 34:58.061
Were you learning urdu?

34:58.063 --> 34:59.796
Yes, I was,
as a matter of fact.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.932
You think that's
entirely appropriate?

35:01.934 --> 35:03.400
Well, I'm empress of India.

35:03.402 --> 35:04.634
What could be more appropriate?

35:04.636 --> 35:08.538
But in front
of the entire household?

35:08.540 --> 35:11.241
You're absolutely right.

35:11.243 --> 35:14.111
I have no privacy here.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.745
Sir Henry.

35:15.747 --> 35:18.915
I would like to go with Abdul
to glassalt shiel.

35:18.917 --> 35:21.118
-Glassalt shiel, your...
-Alone.

35:25.456 --> 35:28.125
But I've only just got here.

36:17.942 --> 36:20.944
Oh, to be by oneself

36:20.946 --> 36:25.081
and live a simple,
rudimentary existence.

36:28.452 --> 36:30.854
They don't understand anything.

36:30.856 --> 36:34.291
These stupid,
aristocratic fools.

36:34.293 --> 36:37.794
Toadying around,
jockeying for position.

36:37.796 --> 36:40.363
I've had it all my life.

36:42.401 --> 36:46.303
They couldn't bear me
bringing dear John brown here.

36:47.338 --> 36:48.672
Yet I was happier here

36:48.674 --> 36:51.041
than anywhere
in the entire world.

36:53.377 --> 36:57.314
Oh, I miss him, Abdul.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.316
And Albert.

37:02.887 --> 37:06.957
It's 30 years now,
and I think of him every day.

37:10.328 --> 37:12.329
I'm so lonely.

37:14.398 --> 37:17.334
Everyone I've really loved
has died,

37:17.336 --> 37:21.071
and I just go on and on.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.082
Your majesty.

37:37.021 --> 37:40.924
It's an impossible position.

37:40.926 --> 37:44.261
No one really knows
what it's like to be queen.

37:48.032 --> 37:49.799
I'm hated
by millions of people

37:49.801 --> 37:53.536
all over the world.

37:53.538 --> 37:55.372
I have had nine children.

37:55.374 --> 37:58.041
All vain and jealous,

37:58.043 --> 38:01.077
and at loggerheads
with each other.

38:01.079 --> 38:04.881
And bertie's
a complete embarrassment.

38:05.883 --> 38:07.450
And look at me.

38:08.486 --> 38:10.887
A fat, lame, impotent,

38:10.889 --> 38:13.957
silly old woman.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.960
What is the point, Abdul?

38:19.463 --> 38:22.198
What is the point?

38:24.402 --> 38:25.969
Service.

38:27.171 --> 38:28.405
Service?

38:28.407 --> 38:30.640
I think we are not here

38:30.642 --> 38:32.075
to worry about ourselves.

38:32.077 --> 38:34.411
We are here
for a greater purpose.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.746
In the koran it says:

38:36.748 --> 38:39.649
"We are here
for the good of others."

38:39.651 --> 38:40.850
The koran?

38:40.852 --> 38:42.419
Yes, I am a hafiz.

38:42.421 --> 38:43.953
I know the koran by heart.

38:43.955 --> 38:46.256
By heart?
Isn't it very long?

38:46.258 --> 38:47.624
114 surahs

38:47.626 --> 38:50.593
containing 6,236 verses.

38:50.595 --> 38:51.828
And you know every word?

38:51.830 --> 38:54.798
Uh, many Muslim people
know the koran.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.600
But...
I thought you were hindu.

38:57.602 --> 39:00.003
I am a Muslim, your majesty.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.439
I learned the koran
from my father.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.174
He's my munshi.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.709
Munshi?

39:05.711 --> 39:07.610
Yes, munshi.

39:07.612 --> 39:09.579
My teacher.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.851
Well, we would like you
to be the queen's munshi.

39:22.159 --> 39:25.128
But... i-I'm only
your servant, your majesty.

39:25.130 --> 39:27.997
A servant cannot be a munshi.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.633
Well, you are a servant
no longer.

39:30.635 --> 39:33.002
You are my teacher.

39:33.004 --> 39:35.004
You will teach me urdu
and the koran

39:35.006 --> 39:38.041
and anything else
you can think of.

39:41.145 --> 39:43.146
<i> So...</i>

39:43.148 --> 39:45.648
What the hell is a munshi?

39:45.650 --> 39:48.752
Well, apparently it's some
sort of a spiritual teacher,

39:48.754 --> 39:50.086
your royal highness.

39:50.088 --> 39:52.155
I mean, has she
completely lost her mind?

39:52.157 --> 39:54.391
She's the head of the church
of england, for god's sake.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.993
What's the archbishop
of canterbury going to say?

39:56.995 --> 39:59.596
I say he's the brown
John brown.

39:59.598 --> 40:02.832
Oh, my god.

40:02.834 --> 40:05.001
Your majesty.

40:05.003 --> 40:06.836
Good evening, bertie.

40:06.838 --> 40:09.239
Mother.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.410
Badzaat...

40:14.845 --> 40:17.080
Dinner is served.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.215
<i> Lady Churchill</i>

40:19.217 --> 40:20.850
was absolutely scandalized--

40:20.852 --> 40:22.185
sitting next to a servant.

40:22.187 --> 40:23.787
And a hindu, to boot.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.955
The munshi is a Muslim scholar,

40:25.957 --> 40:28.625
and knows the koran
off by heart.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.560
And for your information,

40:30.562 --> 40:32.529
he's a servant no longer.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.898
He's to be given
a staff of his own.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.699
What do you mean, "a staff"?

40:36.701 --> 40:38.868
The little fat one.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.203
Oh, this is absurd.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.771
Letters,
invitations to supper--

40:41.773 --> 40:43.973
you're treating him
like a member of the family.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.276
No, I like Abdul.

40:46.278 --> 40:49.212
Lady Churchill had better
get used to the fact,

40:49.214 --> 40:52.215
as the munshi
is coming on holiday with us.

40:52.217 --> 40:54.884
As a member of the household.

40:54.886 --> 40:58.054
You can't take a Muslim
to Florence.

40:58.056 --> 41:01.357
I can take a Muslim
wherever I like.

41:02.226 --> 41:03.726
Good night, bertie.

41:05.897 --> 41:08.398
Munshi?

41:08.400 --> 41:09.632
Yes.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.134
A spiritual advisor?

41:11.136 --> 41:12.602
You haven't an idea
in your head.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.437
You promised
to get us out of here,

41:14.439 --> 41:16.306
and now we're going
to bloody Florence.

41:16.308 --> 41:18.107
You don't see
what a privilege it is

41:18.109 --> 41:19.843
to see the glories of Italy

41:19.845 --> 41:21.244
with all these
wonderful people.

41:21.246 --> 41:22.745
You complete bloody idiot.

41:22.747 --> 41:24.247
Do you think they're
just going to stand there

41:24.249 --> 41:25.582
and let her promote a wog?

41:25.584 --> 41:28.251
I did not come here
to carry your bloody cases.

41:28.253 --> 41:30.186
What are you complaining about?

41:30.188 --> 41:32.922
We have our own carriage
with a bathroom.

41:32.924 --> 41:36.025
They've made a very nice bed
for you on the floor.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.762
Oh, I'm dying here.

41:39.764 --> 41:41.498
I want to go home.

41:41.500 --> 41:45.001
I'm getting sick
of your negative attitude.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.637
Life is a big adventure.

41:47.639 --> 41:51.474
You just need to open up
and enjoy it.

41:51.476 --> 41:53.009
We're on holiday.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.310
And what?

41:54.312 --> 41:57.146
What on earth
can possibly go wrong?

41:57.148 --> 42:00.049
"Do not pull."

42:06.191 --> 42:07.657
I would like to apologize

42:07.659 --> 42:11.060
for the emergency brakes,
your majesty.

42:11.062 --> 42:13.696
A-and I hope
you did not get injured.

42:13.698 --> 42:14.964
Oh, Abdul.

42:14.966 --> 42:16.299
It was nothing.

42:16.301 --> 42:18.635
It was a perfectly
understandable mistake.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.505
I'm so glad you're with us.
What a treat

42:22.507 --> 42:24.474
-to show you Florence for...
-What's he doing here?

42:24.476 --> 42:27.310
Abdul came to explain
what happened earlier.

42:27.312 --> 42:30.413
Well, I really don't see why
i have to share your bathroom.

42:30.415 --> 42:33.016
I shared a bed with my mother
until I became queen.

42:33.018 --> 42:34.584
I am 57 years old.

42:34.586 --> 42:36.653
The munshi has got
his own bathroom.

42:36.655 --> 42:38.555
-Yes, very fine, um...
-Yes, yes.

42:38.557 --> 42:39.756
...bathroom.

42:39.758 --> 42:41.324
Good night, mama.

42:41.326 --> 42:43.159
Good night, Mr. bertie.

42:43.161 --> 42:44.561
Bertie, make sure
you shut that door.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.302
Abdul.

42:54.104 --> 42:56.539
I have something for you.

42:56.541 --> 42:59.008
To celebrate your first visit
to Florence,

42:59.010 --> 43:01.778
and for becoming my munshi.

43:04.048 --> 43:07.951
It is a locket.

43:07.953 --> 43:10.153
With a picture of me.

43:15.125 --> 43:17.594
Uh, how can I ever thank you,

43:17.596 --> 43:19.128
your majesty?

43:19.130 --> 43:22.098
Keep me safe.

43:24.635 --> 43:26.536
Forever.

43:26.538 --> 43:29.872
Oh, Abdul.

43:29.874 --> 43:33.242
You will love Florence.

43:33.244 --> 43:36.613
Such wonderful views.

43:43.988 --> 43:45.888
<i> Isn't it glorious?</i>

43:45.890 --> 43:48.591
<i> Albert loved it here.</i>

43:48.593 --> 43:49.826
<i> He so admired</i>

43:49.828 --> 43:51.461
the medicis...

43:51.463 --> 43:54.664
That they commissioned
the greatest artists of the day

43:54.666 --> 43:59.736
in order to leave
something astonishing behind.

43:59.738 --> 44:01.004
In India, also,

44:01.006 --> 44:03.406
we commission great artists.

44:03.408 --> 44:05.942
Each emperor would bring
the greatest craftsmen

44:05.944 --> 44:09.579
to make great glories
for their durbar room.

44:09.581 --> 44:10.680
Durbar room?

44:10.682 --> 44:13.416
Uh, yes. Every emperor
had a durbar room

44:13.418 --> 44:16.419
full of the finest things
known to man.

44:16.421 --> 44:18.121
Well, I'm the empress of India;

44:18.123 --> 44:19.689
I should have a durbar room.

44:19.691 --> 44:21.591
That's a wonderful idea,
your majesty.

44:21.593 --> 44:23.793
But where would you put it?

44:23.795 --> 44:25.094
Mm...

44:25.096 --> 44:26.963
Oh, the isle of wight,
obviously.

44:26.965 --> 44:28.798
Your majesty,

44:28.800 --> 44:31.668
signor puccini has arrived.

44:48.052 --> 44:49.886
Shh, shh.

45:09.873 --> 45:11.908
Oh.

45:11.910 --> 45:14.644
Where did you say
it was from, Mr. puccini?

45:14.646 --> 45:17.146
From my new opera,
your majesty,

45:17.148 --> 45:19.248
-uh,<i> manon lescaut. </i>
-Ah.

45:19.250 --> 45:22.351
About two lovers
who are separated

45:22.353 --> 45:25.421
by the class divide.

45:25.423 --> 45:28.391
But they run away together.

45:28.393 --> 45:30.359
Oh, it sounds marvelous.

45:30.361 --> 45:32.829
But she is imprisoned
for her love.

45:32.831 --> 45:34.330
Oh.

45:34.332 --> 45:36.099
But they escape.

45:36.101 --> 45:37.233
Bravo.

45:37.235 --> 45:39.669
But, finally, she dies,

45:39.671 --> 45:41.370
and he is

45:41.372 --> 45:44.440
utterly bereft.

45:46.343 --> 45:49.879
I'm not sure we do like
the sound of it after all.

45:49.881 --> 45:52.615
We prefer comic opera.

45:52.617 --> 45:54.517
Do you know
any Gilbert and Sullivan?

45:54.519 --> 45:57.854
Perhaps your majesty
will sing us a song?

45:57.856 --> 45:59.455
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Please.

45:59.457 --> 46:00.857
- No, no, no, I couldn't
possibly... -

46:00.859 --> 46:02.125
-no, I couldn't.
-Please sing, your majesty.

46:02.127 --> 46:03.526
Of course, of course.

46:03.528 --> 46:04.861
- Yes, your majesty.

46:04.863 --> 46:07.196
-No, really...
-Yes, your majesty.

46:07.198 --> 46:09.265
Oh, well...

46:09.267 --> 46:12.368
Maybe just one.

46:12.370 --> 46:16.072
From <i> pinafore,</i> bertie?

46:16.074 --> 46:18.274
Do I have to?

46:52.577 --> 46:56.245
-Marvelous. Splendid.
-Bravo, bravo.

46:56.247 --> 46:57.914
<i> Bellissimo.</i>

46:57.916 --> 47:00.249
I was taught
by mendelssohn, you know.

47:00.251 --> 47:02.418
--To the queen.

47:02.420 --> 47:04.821
- To the queen.
- To the queen.

47:04.823 --> 47:06.989
To me.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.036
Oh.

47:20.038 --> 47:22.772
We shouldn't have had
so much champagne.

47:23.775 --> 47:25.775
Um...

47:26.777 --> 47:28.778
May I?

47:42.960 --> 47:44.694
Oh, Abdul.

47:44.696 --> 47:47.530
I haven't been
as happy as this for years.

47:47.532 --> 47:51.133
When I first
came to england,

47:51.135 --> 47:53.302
I was terrified of you.

47:55.073 --> 47:57.974
But you're a very kind lady.

47:57.976 --> 48:02.144
You're a very unique lady,
to me.

48:02.146 --> 48:04.580
And you are very, very...

48:04.582 --> 48:06.849
Unique to me, Abdul.

48:06.851 --> 48:11.020
I know that you are
much older than me,

48:11.022 --> 48:13.589
and...

48:13.591 --> 48:15.591
You are the queen of england

48:15.593 --> 48:19.161
and the empress of India,

48:19.163 --> 48:21.597
and I'm just a humble munshi...

48:23.834 --> 48:27.270
...but I think

48:27.272 --> 48:28.938
you are
the most special person

48:28.940 --> 48:30.573
in my whole life.

48:32.342 --> 48:34.944
Even more special than my wife.

48:38.115 --> 48:39.782
Wife.

48:39.784 --> 48:42.285
Yes.

48:42.287 --> 48:44.820
You're married?

48:47.190 --> 48:48.591
Of course.

48:48.593 --> 48:51.494
Where is your wife?

48:52.796 --> 48:54.063
In India.

48:54.065 --> 48:57.533
Why didn't you tell me
you were married?

48:57.535 --> 49:00.803
Well, i-i didn't think
it mattered.

49:00.805 --> 49:02.538
Well, of course it matters.

49:02.540 --> 49:04.373
It changes everything.

49:04.375 --> 49:07.843
You must return
to India immediately.

49:09.780 --> 49:12.148
And bring her back at once.

49:43.080 --> 49:45.081
Bloody hell.

49:49.486 --> 49:50.953
He's coming.

50:11.208 --> 50:13.209
How terribly exciting.

50:35.532 --> 50:37.800
It's Ali baba.

50:37.802 --> 50:39.201
Look at the size of him.

50:39.203 --> 50:41.137
Where'd he get those medals?

50:54.851 --> 50:56.819
What the devil is she wearing?

50:56.821 --> 50:58.621
Well, you can't even
see her face.

51:01.391 --> 51:03.325
She looks rather splendid.

51:03.327 --> 51:06.829
But you cannot actually
see her, your majesty.

51:06.831 --> 51:08.764
I think it's rather dignified.

51:10.734 --> 51:11.934
Who the hell is that?

51:11.936 --> 51:13.903
Get the bags, boy. Go.

51:13.905 --> 51:16.072
He's brought a serving boy.

51:20.343 --> 51:22.912
Good god, another one.
How many has he got in there?

51:26.583 --> 51:29.185
Ruddy sod's a bigamist.

51:29.187 --> 51:31.253
I do hope they like
their little cottage.

51:35.459 --> 51:37.460
Your majesty.

51:37.462 --> 51:39.195
I hope it's not inconvenient.

51:39.197 --> 51:41.897
I just thought
we'd pop round for tea.

51:41.899 --> 51:43.299
Oh...

51:47.404 --> 51:48.737
<i> This is</i>

51:48.739 --> 51:51.807
my granddaughter,
Sophia, queen of Greece.

51:51.809 --> 51:55.778
And this is grand duchess
Sophie of saxe-weimar-eisenach.

51:55.780 --> 51:59.648
And my daughter, Princess
Helena Augusta Victoria

51:59.650 --> 52:03.285
of schleswig-holstein-
sonderburg-augustenburg.

52:03.287 --> 52:05.287
This is my wife, Mrs. karim.

52:05.289 --> 52:06.722
And this is my mother-in-law.

52:06.724 --> 52:10.426
Your majesty;
Sophia, queen of Greece;

52:10.428 --> 52:11.560
grand duchess Sophie

52:11.562 --> 52:13.662
of saxe-weimar-eisenach;

52:13.664 --> 52:16.265
Princess Helena
Augusta Victoria

52:16.267 --> 52:20.236
of schleswig-holstein-
sonderburg-augustenburg...

52:21.338 --> 52:23.906
I would like
to take this opportunity,

52:23.908 --> 52:25.908
on behalf of myself,

52:25.910 --> 52:29.178
my wife,
and my wife's mother

52:29.180 --> 52:31.947
to thank her majesty
for accommodating us.

52:31.949 --> 52:35.684
We are very grateful
for her infinite kindness

52:35.686 --> 52:38.287
and interior decoration.

52:38.289 --> 52:41.590
The gift of hospitality

52:41.592 --> 52:43.125
and friendship to strangers

52:43.127 --> 52:46.095
is of very high importance
in our culture,

52:46.097 --> 52:48.430
and so we are honored
to repay it

52:48.432 --> 52:50.432
in our own small way.

52:50.434 --> 52:53.269
What is ours is yours.

52:53.271 --> 52:54.537
Quite literally.

52:54.539 --> 52:56.539
<i> Alhamdulillah.</i>

52:56.541 --> 52:59.942
My dear munshi,

52:59.944 --> 53:02.511
we are so glad
to have you here, my children.

53:02.513 --> 53:04.613
We have missed you enormously.

53:04.615 --> 53:07.783
I can't wait to show you
the durbar room.

53:07.785 --> 53:10.452
"Children"? Ponsonby,

53:10.454 --> 53:12.955
you will have to do something
about this.

53:12.957 --> 53:15.624
My dear munshi,
I'm so glad you're back.

53:15.626 --> 53:17.960
It's been dreadfully dull
without you.

53:17.962 --> 53:21.630
And I'm so glad
to meet Mrs. karim.

53:23.301 --> 53:25.134
There is just one thing

53:25.136 --> 53:27.970
I've been curious
about the whole afternoon.

53:27.972 --> 53:31.173
What does she look like
behind her veil?

53:31.175 --> 53:33.142
You must see her.

53:33.144 --> 53:34.343
Is that allowed?

53:34.345 --> 53:35.878
You're a lady.

53:35.880 --> 53:38.914
- And the empress of India.

53:38.916 --> 53:41.383
Well, where the bloody hell's
she going now?

53:48.191 --> 53:50.759
Your majesty.

54:17.255 --> 54:19.722
Oh.

54:19.724 --> 54:22.591
You really are beautiful.

54:23.928 --> 54:25.894
<i> What on earth is</i>

54:25.896 --> 54:27.630
-a durbar room?
-It's a celebration

54:27.632 --> 54:29.231
of all things Indian,
prime minister,

54:29.233 --> 54:31.767
inspired
by the mughal emperors.

54:31.769 --> 54:33.369
But I don't understand.

54:33.371 --> 54:36.105
Who gave her permission to
build this in the first place?

54:36.107 --> 54:39.041
Don't blame me.
I was in monte Carlo.

54:39.043 --> 54:41.110
I'm afraid she's a law
unto herself, prime minister.

54:41.112 --> 54:44.413
For god's sake.
She'll be wearing a burka next.

54:44.415 --> 54:46.215
Prime minister.

54:46.217 --> 54:47.383
You are late.

54:47.385 --> 54:50.419
I'm terribly sorry,
your majesty.

54:50.421 --> 54:51.754
Well, let us begin.

54:51.756 --> 54:53.622
This, as you can see,

54:53.624 --> 54:56.725
is the Indian corridor.

54:56.727 --> 55:02.131
The durbar room was designed
by Mr. bhai ram Singh.

55:03.099 --> 55:05.401
The place is crawling
with them.

55:05.403 --> 55:07.636
We have commissioned
a series of portraits

55:07.638 --> 55:09.505
of eminent Indians.

55:09.507 --> 55:13.509
This, Princess gowramma.

55:13.511 --> 55:15.678
And this, of course,

55:15.680 --> 55:17.479
is the munshi.

55:17.481 --> 55:20.516
An honor to meet you,
Mr. prime minister, sir.

55:20.518 --> 55:22.851
- A good likeness,
don't you think? -

55:22.853 --> 55:26.822
uh, I asked him
to take a-a few pounds off.

55:26.824 --> 55:28.957
Uh, this is my wife,

55:28.959 --> 55:30.793
-Mr. prime minister, sir.
-Oh.

55:30.795 --> 55:33.495
And that is my mother-in-law.

55:33.497 --> 55:35.497
At least I think
that's the right way round.

55:37.501 --> 55:41.970
These are my servants,
Mohammed and Ahmed.

55:41.972 --> 55:45.974
And this is the durbar room.

55:45.976 --> 55:49.378
What the hell is going on here,
ponsonby?

55:56.286 --> 55:59.288
The carvings
are from uttar pradesh.

55:59.290 --> 56:02.658
And the carpet was woven
in a jail in agra.

56:02.660 --> 56:05.327
Perfect, I think,
for the tableau.

56:05.329 --> 56:11.200
But the pièce de résistance
is the peacock throne,

56:11.202 --> 56:14.403
an exact copy of the one
at agra.

56:15.739 --> 56:18.974
And, of course, the kohinoor.

56:18.976 --> 56:22.211
Now I really do feel
like the empress of India.

56:23.347 --> 56:25.647
I thought
she was supposed to be dying.

56:25.649 --> 56:27.983
It really is a remarkable
addition to the house,

56:27.985 --> 56:29.351
your majesty.

56:29.353 --> 56:32.054
We have Abdul to thank
for the whole idea.

56:32.056 --> 56:34.189
To celebrate the completion
of the durbar room,

56:34.191 --> 56:36.925
a little surprise,
your majesty.

56:39.429 --> 56:40.729
What is it?

56:40.731 --> 56:43.165
A mango, your majesty.

56:43.167 --> 56:44.767
One moment,

56:44.769 --> 56:46.969
your majesty.

56:50.841 --> 56:55.511
Uh, it-it's... off.

56:57.380 --> 56:59.381
Sir Henry,

56:59.383 --> 57:01.116
this mango is off.

57:05.122 --> 57:09.024
I'm-I'm terribly sorry,
your majesty.

57:09.926 --> 57:11.360
--Here.

57:11.362 --> 57:14.263
Take one of these
whenever you see the munshi.

57:15.632 --> 57:17.366
I can't wait
to show you the tableau,

57:17.368 --> 57:19.401
prime minister.

57:21.138 --> 57:24.940
A line
has definitively been crossed.

57:24.942 --> 57:27.075
I can't go onstage like this.

57:27.077 --> 57:29.044
I'm absolutely sick.

57:29.046 --> 57:30.546
Oh, but you have to.

57:30.548 --> 57:32.381
The prime minister
will be watching.

57:32.383 --> 57:35.050
This is a complete
and utter disaster.

57:35.052 --> 57:38.086
I don't know
what you're talking about.

57:38.088 --> 57:39.388
They've been waiting for this.

57:39.390 --> 57:40.389
Who? Who have?

57:40.391 --> 57:41.924
Ponsonby, Reid,
the whole damn lot.

57:41.926 --> 57:44.326
-Uh-huh. -Don't you see? She's
been rubbing their noses in it,

57:44.328 --> 57:45.727
but now it's going public.

57:45.729 --> 57:47.963
I'm telling you, they're
not going to stand for it.

57:47.965 --> 57:50.399
They'll rise up
and chop your bloody balls off.

57:50.401 --> 57:51.400
No, but I haven't done
anything.

57:51.402 --> 57:52.668
You stupid bloody uncle tom.

57:52.670 --> 57:54.736
You can't win on their terms.

57:57.575 --> 58:00.209
Mrs. munshi.

58:02.245 --> 58:04.513
Bertie.

58:08.318 --> 58:11.854
I've never been so humiliated
in my entire life.

58:11.856 --> 58:14.857
Actually,
I'm rather enjoying it.

58:14.859 --> 58:18.126
Beginners onstage, please.

58:19.663 --> 58:23.131
A scene in ancient persia.

58:27.170 --> 58:31.874
I am the sultan of persia!

58:31.876 --> 58:35.811
The king of all kings.

58:49.826 --> 58:51.627
Your highness!

58:51.629 --> 58:57.432
We bestow upon you
all the riches of the orient.

59:04.240 --> 59:07.142
You are now under my power!

59:18.087 --> 59:22.124
Bravo! Bravo, the munshi!

59:38.409 --> 59:40.108
What the hell is this,
ponsonby?

59:40.110 --> 59:41.677
Munshi-mania?

59:41.679 --> 59:43.779
I'm trying
to keep an empire together.

59:43.781 --> 59:46.248
It looks like
they're running the place.

59:46.250 --> 59:50.085
I want this whole sodding mess
knocked on the head.

59:50.087 --> 59:51.520
Or you're finished!

59:51.522 --> 59:54.189
Understood?

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.365
Oh, sir Henry.

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:06.068
Tell us, what exactly did
the prime minister say

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.703
about the tableau?

01:00:07.705 --> 01:00:09.705
Well, uh...

01:00:09.707 --> 01:00:11.940
To be entirely frank,
your majesty,

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.610
he seemed to be
a little perturbed.

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:15.811
Whatever for?

01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:17.412
He must have liked the munshi.

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:20.382
I think the munshi
was the problem, your majesty.

01:00:20.384 --> 01:00:22.084
Really?
I thought he was rather good.

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:23.485
I think he meant his position.

01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:25.053
And I think
he was rather alarmed

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:26.421
he had such a...

01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:28.757
Prominent role
in the household.

01:00:28.759 --> 01:00:30.058
Well, of course
Abdul has a prominent role

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.059
in the household.

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:32.594
He is my munshi.

01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:35.063
But he's an Indian,
your majesty.

01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:36.732
I am aware of that.

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:38.600
Given the current sensitivities

01:00:38.602 --> 01:00:40.502
in the subcontinent,
your majesty,

01:00:40.504 --> 01:00:43.438
the prime minister was
concerned that it might be...

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.074
Sending the wrong message.

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:49.745
I should have thought
it was a jolly good message.

01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:51.613
But he's a Muslim,
your majesty.

01:00:51.615 --> 01:00:53.081
Precisely.

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:55.751
We owe them so much, do we not?

01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:58.887
For their role in the mutiny,
for example.

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:01.923
The mutiny, your majesty?

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:05.093
Yes, for the help
they gave us with the hindus.

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:11.700
Uh, but the mutiny was
a Muslim-led revolt,

01:01:11.702 --> 01:01:13.502
your majesty.

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:17.272
Are you sure?

01:01:17.274 --> 01:01:19.274
Of course.

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:21.476
The Muslim soldiers revolted

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:23.545
when it was rumored
that their rifles

01:01:23.547 --> 01:01:26.748
were greased with pork fat.

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:30.118
Really?

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.788
The grand mufti himself

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:36.958
put out a fatwa against you
personally, your majesty.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.627
And Muslim soldiers

01:01:38.629 --> 01:01:43.365
murdered
over 2,000 British personnel.

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:48.704
Who have you been talking to,
mother?

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:54.142
Ta-da!

01:01:56.647 --> 01:01:58.547
I have opened my heart to you.

01:01:58.549 --> 01:02:00.649
I brought your family
from India.

01:02:00.651 --> 01:02:03.485
I promoted you in the face
of considerable opposition

01:02:03.487 --> 01:02:05.654
and disquiet
from the household.

01:02:05.656 --> 01:02:08.890
I even turned a blind eye
when you failed to tell me

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:11.326
that you were married,
which, as you know,

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:13.495
came as quite a surprise.

01:02:13.497 --> 01:02:15.330
How could
you let me humiliate myself

01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:17.499
in front
of the entire household?

01:02:17.501 --> 01:02:19.401
I am deeply sorry,
your majesty.

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:22.838
You said the hindus
were behind the mutiny.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.940
I didn't say
it was only the hindus.

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:26.842
You told me
categorically the muslims

01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:28.944
-were my friends. -We are
your friends, your ma...

01:02:28.946 --> 01:02:31.379
Abdul,
there is a fatwa against me.

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:33.582
It was the muslims
who started the whole thing.

01:02:33.584 --> 01:02:36.752
This is
completely unacceptable.

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:41.356
Abdul, I thought you were...

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:43.859
Outstanding
as the sultan of persia,

01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:46.361
but I'm afraid
you have to go home.

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:58.373
You've hurt my feelings
very much, indeed.

01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:01.376
Don't you see the position
you have put me in?

01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:09.384
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:12.053
I will miss you
a very great deal.

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.915
So...

01:03:39.917 --> 01:03:42.417
We're going home?

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:12.214
Good night, mother.

01:04:12.216 --> 01:04:14.883
Good night.

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:31.192
Mrs. tuck.

01:05:31.194 --> 01:05:33.762
Mrs. tuck.

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:47.375
Abdul,

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:49.744
you've been an utter fool,

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:52.414
and I'm absolutely furious
with you.

01:05:52.416 --> 01:05:55.650
It is unconscionable that,
as my munshi,

01:05:55.652 --> 01:05:58.053
you should have lied to me
in any way.

01:05:58.055 --> 01:05:59.654
But it...

01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:03.058
It would be
also completely churlish of me

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:07.228
not to recognize
the considerable kindness

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.631
and devotion you have shown.

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:16.171
I suppose, in some way, you
thought you were protecting me.

01:06:16.173 --> 01:06:18.406
But as the monarch, I realize

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:22.410
that nothing
can really protect me.

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:25.513
And so, in that light,
i have decided,

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:30.185
although
I'm very disappointed...

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:32.187
That I want you to stay.

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:36.458
Your gracious majesty.

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.660
Thank you, your majesty.

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:42.864
But, Abdul, there is something
we must sort out.

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:48.536
I am deeply concerned
about Mrs. karim.

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:50.605
Mrs. karim?

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:53.942
By now, one would have expected

01:06:53.944 --> 01:06:57.846
to hear the pitter-patter
of little Muslim feet

01:06:57.848 --> 01:07:01.182
along the corridors
of Osborne house.

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:06.221
I am concerned
that everything is...

01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:08.223
Functioning...

01:07:08.225 --> 01:07:09.991
Below stairs.

01:07:12.896 --> 01:07:16.464
I want you to examine
Mrs. karim.

01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:18.466
Examine Mrs. karim?

01:07:18.468 --> 01:07:20.035
Mm.

01:07:20.037 --> 01:07:23.171
Just, um, make sure
that everything's...

01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:24.639
Working.

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:26.975
But, your majesty, uh,

01:07:26.977 --> 01:07:30.145
I thought the munshi
and his family were leaving us.

01:07:30.147 --> 01:07:32.280
Whatever gave you
that impression?

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:36.418
The munshi and his family
are integral parts

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.253
of the royal household.

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:41.856
<i> As far as I'm concerned,</i>

01:07:41.858 --> 01:07:44.592
this is war. We're gonna dig up
every last bit of dirt

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:46.194
this blackguard's ever done.

01:07:46.196 --> 01:07:48.863
I want someone in India raking
through the family coals.

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:50.865
Your son's out there,
isn't he, ponsonby?

01:07:50.867 --> 01:07:53.268
Well, I couldn't possibly be
involved in subterfuge,

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:54.536
your royal highness.

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:57.539
Look, very soon,
i am going to be king.

01:07:57.541 --> 01:08:00.675
You will bloody well do
as you're told!

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:02.744
You'll leave no stone unturned.

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.679
You will make a dossier
and you'll put it all down

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:05.680
in black and white

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:08.349
and put an end
to all this shit!

01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:10.685
For good.

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:21.162
Well, I'd better go
and examine Mrs. munshi.

01:08:22.363 --> 01:08:24.532
Oh. Dr. Reid.

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:27.135
Do come in.

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:29.804
She'll have to uncover
her face.

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:31.738
That is impossible, sir.

01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:34.109
I need to see her tongue.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.120
Well?

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:46.554
She's fine.

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:59.334
Uh, Mr. Mohammed,
we have come here

01:08:59.336 --> 01:09:02.904
because we are not unaware
of your predicament.

01:09:02.906 --> 01:09:06.474
That you arrived in the first
place almost by accident

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:08.743
and now find yourself
stuck here

01:09:08.745 --> 01:09:10.612
through a bizarre set
of circumstances,

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:12.447
none of your own making.

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:16.484
Nor is it beneath our notice
that the, um, inclement

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:20.321
English weather has been the
cause of a precipitous decline

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:23.091
in your general health.

01:09:23.093 --> 01:09:25.760
What is more,

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:29.330
uh, you continue to suffer
the vast indignity

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:31.533
of being a servant
to someone who is,

01:09:31.535 --> 01:09:33.935
in many ways, your inferior.

01:09:33.937 --> 01:09:37.272
So it occurred to us
that, um...

01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:40.742
We might be able
to offer you some help.

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:45.380
Help?

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.048
Travel home.

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:48.783
Perhaps a modest pension.

01:09:48.785 --> 01:09:51.986
In return, of course,
for, um...

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:55.023
A little information.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.861
Ah.

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:04.332
You want me to...

01:10:04.334 --> 01:10:06.167
Dish the dirty?

01:10:06.169 --> 01:10:09.337
In a manner of speaking.

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:11.940
Well...

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:17.345
What would you like me to say?

01:10:17.347 --> 01:10:19.814
Anything, really.

01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:22.483
Well, well,
we need details. Um...

01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:24.319
- What he says.

01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:26.988
What he does.

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:34.696
Abdul...

01:10:34.698 --> 01:10:36.664
Does what everyone else does.

01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:38.833
He, uh...

01:10:39.668 --> 01:10:43.504
He looks for preferment.

01:10:43.506 --> 01:10:45.673
He curries favor.

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:54.716
He, um, crawls up

01:10:54.718 --> 01:10:58.453
the stinking greasy pole

01:10:58.455 --> 01:11:01.356
of the shitty British empire...

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:06.527
...making fools of all of you,

01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:10.398
because he is a servant,

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:13.034
an Indian Muslim servant,

01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:14.702
and you are all...

01:11:14.704 --> 01:11:17.071
Quaking in your boots
because...

01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:19.274
He's beating you
at your own game.

01:11:19.276 --> 01:11:22.744
No one is quaking
in their boots.

01:11:22.746 --> 01:11:25.613
We are the most powerful nation
on earth,

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.882
at the height of our influence.

01:11:27.884 --> 01:11:29.951
In that case,

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:33.121
the only way is down.

01:11:33.123 --> 01:11:37.292
So stick
your stupid British empire

01:11:37.294 --> 01:11:40.895
up your stinky,
royal bottom hole,

01:11:40.897 --> 01:11:43.197
Mr. bertie prince, sir.

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:53.341
I hope he makes the whole
damn thing come tumbling down.

01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:06.487
I will see to it
that you die here.

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:14.529
He didn't say anything.

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:17.832
Wh-what do you mean
he didn't say anything?

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:19.500
We did our best with him,
but I...

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:23.504
-He spoke most intemperately...
-The man is an absolute shit.

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:26.374
Dr. Reid.

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:27.975
I'm not a fool.

01:12:27.977 --> 01:12:29.977
I know there is
some skulduggery afoot.

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:31.379
Something's going on here,

01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:33.448
and I'm not going
to stand for it.

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:35.450
Dr. Reid, I asked you

01:12:35.452 --> 01:12:38.886
to get to the bottom of
Mrs. karim's fertility issues.

01:12:38.888 --> 01:12:40.455
It seems
that nothing has been done.

01:12:40.457 --> 01:12:43.124
Oh, well, uh, actually,
your majesty,

01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:47.628
it was impossible to make
a conclusive judgment...

01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:49.530
For religious reasons.

01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:50.865
Did you examine the munshi?

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:52.834
No, your majesty.

01:12:52.836 --> 01:12:54.402
Well, examine the munshi.

01:12:54.404 --> 01:12:56.404
Bertie.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.241
Your majesty.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:04.812
I did not do seven
years at Edinburgh university

01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:07.582
to look at Indian dicks.

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.820
Trousers.

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:36.844
Eureka!

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:39.280
He is riddled with the clap!

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.284
Well, well.

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:46.454
--Mother, we have to see you.

01:13:46.456 --> 01:13:47.855
Alone.

01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:50.525
I'm in the middle
of my urdu lesson.

01:13:50.527 --> 01:13:53.361
Mother, we come
with very important news

01:13:53.363 --> 01:13:55.396
of a highly personal matter.

01:13:55.398 --> 01:13:57.565
I've nothing
to hide from Abdul.

01:13:57.567 --> 01:14:00.968
Please, your majesty.

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:16.484
Uh, your majesty, um,

01:14:16.486 --> 01:14:20.455
I'm afraid our news concerns
the, uh, munshi.

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:25.059
Um, we have proof beyond
any doubt that Abdul karim

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:30.765
is a... a-a low-born...
Impostor,

01:14:30.767 --> 01:14:33.334
your majesty.

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:37.939
The munshi is
from a noble family,

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:40.575
and a long line of teachers.

01:14:40.577 --> 01:14:44.178
No, I'm afraid he was
a mere clerk in a common jail.

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:47.248
Uh, my own son has sent word

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:49.183
from India
and has actually spoken

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:51.352
to his immediate superior.

01:14:51.354 --> 01:14:54.422
His family are completely

01:14:54.424 --> 01:14:55.623
uneducated.

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:59.126
His father is
a lowly apothecary.

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:02.330
The munshi never even went
to school, mother.

01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:04.499
The man's a complete fraud.

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:06.667
And here he is,
overlooking the boxes.

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:09.270
I'm afraid
it's true, your majesty.

01:15:09.272 --> 01:15:13.074
Abdul and his father
are completely common.

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:18.112
Uh, we have prepared a dossier.

01:15:18.114 --> 01:15:20.515
You despicable toads!

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:23.851
Racialists!

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.319
Spying? Dossier?

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:26.721
Picking on a poor
defenseless Indian?

01:15:26.723 --> 01:15:29.624
Of course he doesn't have
qualifications.

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:31.659
They do things completely
differently out there.

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:33.961
But don't you see, mama?

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:36.797
He's using his position
for his own gain.

01:15:36.799 --> 01:15:41.335
And how does that make him
any different from any of you?

01:15:41.337 --> 01:15:43.638
How dare you look down
on Abdul?

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:47.475
How dare you defame
his poor father?

01:15:47.477 --> 01:15:51.012
Bertie, I'm ashamed
that you're part of all this.

01:15:51.014 --> 01:15:54.715
Abdul is a loyal, wise,
sympathetic human being

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:57.685
who has raised himself
on his own merits.

01:15:57.687 --> 01:16:00.221
Bring Abdul in here.

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:04.158
Bring him in!

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:07.361
--Now,

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:09.230
I want you to repeat after me.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:11.132
"I will be courteous
to the munshi."

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:24.011
I-i... I will be courteous
to the munshi.

01:16:24.013 --> 01:16:26.581
You.

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:29.016
I will be courteous
to the munshi.

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:30.952
Bertie. All of you.

01:16:30.954 --> 01:16:34.522
"I will be courteous
to the munshi."

01:16:35.725 --> 01:16:38.693
I will be courteous
to the munshi.

01:16:38.695 --> 01:16:40.761
It has become apparent

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:44.031
that in order to get
any respect from the household,

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:46.300
one needs
to be formally recognized.

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:51.872
In which case, Abdul...
I intend

01:16:51.874 --> 01:16:54.976
to give you a knighthood
in the next honors list.

01:16:54.978 --> 01:16:57.445
Enough! This is absurd!

01:16:57.447 --> 01:16:59.547
We cannot protect you
from this any further.

01:16:59.549 --> 01:17:02.216
The man is riddled
with gonorrhea!

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.054
Gonorrhea?

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:09.223
Yes.

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:11.792
Uh, your majesty.

01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:18.165
Well, you are a doctor.

01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:20.067
Why don't you treat him?

01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:23.504
Now get out of my sight,
all of you!

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:31.312
- Listen,

01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:33.114
you pox-ridden Indian shit.

01:17:33.116 --> 01:17:35.816
-Why don't you bloody well
leave her alone? -Dr. Reid.

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:39.820
Dr. Reid, be courteous!

01:17:48.031 --> 01:17:50.097
Knighted?

01:17:50.099 --> 01:17:51.766
Surely there is

01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:52.833
some law against it.

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:54.802
The man's a common Indian,
for god's sakes.

01:17:54.804 --> 01:17:56.771
Well, she can't just
do what she likes.

01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:58.105
That's right.

01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:00.274
We are the ones
who make this palace work,

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:02.176
and we are being ignored

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:03.611
-and exploited.
-Yes. -Yes.

01:18:03.613 --> 01:18:06.280
We have to stand up
to this wanton bullying.

01:18:06.282 --> 01:18:08.115
But she's the queen.

01:18:08.117 --> 01:18:10.184
She's our sovereign.

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:11.952
Her position is based
entirely on

01:18:11.954 --> 01:18:14.689
the implicit contract
she makes with us.

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:18.359
If she does not drop
this preposterous insult,

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:20.695
we should all leave!

01:18:20.697 --> 01:18:22.363
- Yeah. -Yeah.

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:26.200
Somebody has to tell her.

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:30.604
We should make a deputation.

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.708
I think you should go.

01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:35.543
You're the head
of the household.

01:18:35.545 --> 01:18:37.645
Oh, no,
i couldn't possibly go.

01:18:37.647 --> 01:18:39.814
It would bring the position
into disrepute.

01:18:39.816 --> 01:18:42.416
Mrs. tuck.

01:18:43.819 --> 01:18:45.986
You know her very well,
don't you?

01:18:45.988 --> 01:18:48.022
But I'm just her dresser.

01:18:48.024 --> 01:18:49.790
What about you, miss phipps?

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:56.964
--Off you go.

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:12.913
And don't take no
for an answer.

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:25.693
Your majesty.

01:19:25.695 --> 01:19:28.262
Out with it.

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:30.197
Girl, can't you see, I'm busy?

01:19:31.634 --> 01:19:35.369
There is something
i must say that, uh...

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:39.039
What is the meaning of this?

01:19:39.041 --> 01:19:40.541
Stop shaking.

01:19:40.543 --> 01:19:43.310
I have come to ask you to...

01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:46.480
Reconsider the, uh...

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:48.249
The elevation of...

01:19:49.919 --> 01:19:51.619
...of Mr. karim.

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.989
What did you say?

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:58.793
I've come to ask you

01:19:58.795 --> 01:20:01.796
not to give Mr. karim
a knighthood, your majesty.

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:05.466
Why the devil not?

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:08.636
The members
of the household demand

01:20:08.638 --> 01:20:11.672
that you abandon
your plans, your majesty.

01:20:11.674 --> 01:20:13.407
Demand?

01:20:14.977 --> 01:20:19.680
We believe that it degrades
the very concept of knighthood.

01:20:19.682 --> 01:20:24.351
He comes from a very low
family, your majesty.

01:20:24.353 --> 01:20:29.023
And... he is colored.

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:31.425
Get out of my sight.

01:20:36.464 --> 01:20:38.098
Did you not hear me?

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:40.601
Your majesty, I must inform you

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:42.436
that if you refuse,

01:20:42.438 --> 01:20:45.806
the entire household
will resign.

01:20:45.808 --> 01:20:47.308
Treason.

01:20:49.111 --> 01:20:50.945
Treason!

01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:57.885
Treason.

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:25.946
Mummy, enough is enough.

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:31.819
You will drop this munshi
business forthwith.

01:21:31.821 --> 01:21:34.388
Do you hear me?

01:21:36.258 --> 01:21:38.559
Did you really think the...

01:21:38.561 --> 01:21:41.028
The household would countenance
such an insult?

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:42.696
I will not be disobeyed.

01:21:42.698 --> 01:21:44.098
No. No.

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:46.934
I have put up with you
for over 50 years!

01:21:46.936 --> 01:21:50.371
You will drop this
forthwith, or...?

01:21:50.373 --> 01:21:52.840
-Or, or, or, or, bertie?
-Or

01:21:52.842 --> 01:21:57.478
we will have you
certified insane!

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:03.817
And removed
from office immediately.

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:08.956
Here are the papers signed
by Dr. Reid.

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:28.642
I am 81 years of age.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:33.781
I've had nine children
and 42 grandchildren,

01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:37.451
and have almost
a billion citizens.

01:22:39.587 --> 01:22:42.489
I have rheumatism,

01:22:42.491 --> 01:22:44.491
a collapsed uterus,

01:22:44.493 --> 01:22:49.463
I'm morbidly obese
and deaf in one ear.

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:55.069
I have known 11 prime ministers

01:22:55.071 --> 01:23:00.207
and passed 2,347 pieces
of legislation.

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:05.446
I've been in office 62 years,
234 days.

01:23:05.448 --> 01:23:10.017
Thus, I am the longest-serving
monarch in world history.

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:16.423
I'm responsible
for five households

01:23:16.425 --> 01:23:19.093
and a staff of over 3,000.

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:25.532
I am cantankerous,

01:23:25.534 --> 01:23:28.435
boring, greedy,

01:23:28.437 --> 01:23:30.771
fat, ill-tempered,

01:23:30.773 --> 01:23:32.940
at times selfish and myopic,

01:23:32.942 --> 01:23:35.943
both metaphorically
and literally.

01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:39.446
I am perhaps

01:23:39.448 --> 01:23:43.384
disagreeably attached
to power

01:23:43.386 --> 01:23:47.921
and should not have smashed
the emperor of Russia's egg.

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:54.695
But I am anything but insane.

01:23:56.965 --> 01:24:01.668
If the household wish
to disobey me, so be it.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:04.872
Let them do it to my face.

01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:08.642
I will see everyone
in the durbar room at once.

01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:35.069
Her majesty the queen.

01:24:46.849 --> 01:24:50.350
I understand
there is some concern

01:24:50.352 --> 01:24:53.087
over my desires on preferment.

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:57.257
I understand
feelings have run high.

01:24:57.259 --> 01:25:00.727
And I understand
you have decided to resign

01:25:00.729 --> 01:25:03.864
rather than withstand
my decision.

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:07.534
If any one of you

01:25:07.536 --> 01:25:10.737
wishes to tender
their resignation,

01:25:10.739 --> 01:25:13.040
it will be accepted

01:25:13.042 --> 01:25:18.846
without any
unfortunate consequences.

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:26.620
But at least have the decency
to do it to my face.

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:33.994
Anyone wishing to resign,
please step forward.

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:57.251
Hmm.

01:26:00.088 --> 01:26:02.789
I would like to inform you
that I have decided

01:26:02.791 --> 01:26:07.661
against awarding
any knighthoods at this moment.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.602
Instead,
you'll be delighted to know

01:26:15.604 --> 01:26:19.039
that I have decided
to make the munshi

01:26:19.041 --> 01:26:21.775
a commander
of the royal victorian order

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:26.647
as a special token
of my personal esteem

01:26:26.649 --> 01:26:30.184
for his services to the empire.

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:35.189
That is all.

01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:57.477
Your ma... your majesty.
Your majesty!

01:26:57.479 --> 01:26:59.880
--Your
majesty, are you all right?

01:27:02.818 --> 01:27:05.919
Dr. Reid! Dr. Reid!

01:27:05.921 --> 01:27:07.554
-Dr. Reid!
-Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:09.723
-Dr. Reid, you must come quick!
-No, no, no, not now.

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:12.492
-Dr. Reid, it's Mr. Mohammed!
-Get that boy out of here.

01:27:12.494 --> 01:27:14.661
- Your majesty, can you hear me?

01:27:14.663 --> 01:27:17.097
-Your majesty?
-Oh.

01:27:17.099 --> 01:27:18.932
--Okay. -Just...

01:27:18.934 --> 01:27:22.402
- All right, let's get you up.

01:28:04.545 --> 01:28:07.047
I'm so sorry, Abdul.

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:26.400
I think it's time
you went home, Abdul.

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:34.107
This is my home.

01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:38.211
I've been shortsighted
and selfish.

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:42.249
You are a young man.

01:28:42.251 --> 01:28:44.985
You have your whole life
ahead of you.

01:28:44.987 --> 01:28:46.787
It's not safe here.

01:28:46.789 --> 01:28:48.121
Your majesty.

01:28:48.123 --> 01:28:50.691
The vultures are already
circling.

01:28:50.693 --> 01:28:53.593
How can I protect you
if I'm not here?

01:28:53.595 --> 01:28:56.530
Your majesty, you will reign
for many years to come.

01:28:56.532 --> 01:28:57.931
No, Abdul.

01:28:57.933 --> 01:29:00.600
I'm sick.

01:29:00.602 --> 01:29:05.072
All these stupid ceremonies
will kill me.

01:29:06.774 --> 01:29:08.775
You have been
a very good friend,

01:29:08.777 --> 01:29:11.111
but you must leave me.

01:29:11.113 --> 01:29:13.847
I'm your servant.

01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:21.388
And as long I shall live,
i shall be by your side.

01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:23.457
Every single day.

01:29:23.459 --> 01:29:27.494
Nothing...
Nothing will stop me.

01:29:27.496 --> 01:29:29.129
Abdul, I am your queen.

01:29:29.131 --> 01:29:31.665
Your majesty, I'm your munshi,

01:29:31.667 --> 01:29:33.800
and I will never leave you.

01:29:33.802 --> 01:29:36.303
You are a fool.

01:29:36.305 --> 01:29:38.605
But I adore you.

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:23.643
I think
you should inform the kaiser.

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.760
Abdu... Abdul, uh, Abdul.

01:31:40.762 --> 01:31:44.598
It's me, mummy,
and your grandson, Wilhelm.

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.600
Where is my munshi?

01:31:46.602 --> 01:31:47.934
The kaiser.

01:31:47.936 --> 01:31:50.136
-I need my munshi.
-Hush, hush.

01:31:50.138 --> 01:31:51.605
Everything will be all right.

01:31:51.607 --> 01:31:55.275
I want... I want
the munshi. I want mun...

01:32:04.285 --> 01:32:07.554
Don't you dare upset her.

01:32:41.923 --> 01:32:44.558
I want to talk
to the munshi alone.

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:47.761
Uh, I think perhaps,
your majesty...

01:32:47.763 --> 01:32:50.864
I said alone.

01:33:11.786 --> 01:33:15.021
When I was young...

01:33:15.023 --> 01:33:18.158
I used to long for death.

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:24.397
Now, when there
is nothing to live for,

01:33:24.399 --> 01:33:28.335
I cling to life
with every breath.

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:34.541
I'm scared, Abdul.

01:33:34.543 --> 01:33:36.610
Don't be scared.

01:33:41.649 --> 01:33:45.085
"Listen, little drop,

01:33:45.087 --> 01:33:48.388
"give yourself up
without regret,

01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:52.292
"and in return
you will gain the ocean.

01:33:52.294 --> 01:33:55.662
"Give yourself away,

01:33:55.664 --> 01:33:57.897
"and in the great sea

01:33:57.899 --> 01:34:00.800
you will be secure."

01:34:00.802 --> 01:34:02.869
Rumi.

01:34:04.405 --> 01:34:08.308
You are a teacher, Abdul.

01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:10.877
Everybody knows rumi.

01:34:12.747 --> 01:34:14.547
Allah is the teacher.

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:22.756
Love is the whole.

01:34:22.758 --> 01:34:26.259
We are only pieces.

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:50.216
I keep thinking...

01:34:50.218 --> 01:34:53.353
I'm falling.

01:34:55.956 --> 01:34:58.792
Fall.

01:35:00.661 --> 01:35:03.363
All will be well.

01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:10.904
You are about to go
to a much safer place.

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:18.244
"The banquet hall...

01:35:18.246 --> 01:35:20.447
Of eternity."

01:35:27.588 --> 01:35:30.623
Yes.

01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:39.833
Good-bye...

01:35:39.835 --> 01:35:41.801
My queen.

01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:49.876
Good-bye.

01:35:49.878 --> 01:35:53.213
Take care,

01:35:53.215 --> 01:35:56.349
my s...

01:35:56.351 --> 01:35:58.585
Sweet son.

01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:13.466
Let her sleep.

01:36:23.544 --> 01:36:25.712
Someone's coming.

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:38.411
I grieve to say

01:38:38.413 --> 01:38:42.382
her majesty passed away
at 6:30, precisely.

01:38:42.384 --> 01:38:45.585
Long live the king.

01:40:30.658 --> 01:40:33.860
-Out of the way!
-Rashida! Rashida!

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:47.707
I want every last thing
that's connected to her.

01:40:48.509 --> 01:40:49.809
Hey!

01:40:49.811 --> 01:40:51.744
Abdul! Abdul!

01:41:06.393 --> 01:41:08.728
I want you out of here.

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:12.932
Immediately.

01:41:28.683 --> 01:41:31.150
Your majesty...

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:26.566
Good morning, your majesty.

01:43:26.568 --> 01:43:28.935
How are you today?
