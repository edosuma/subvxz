01:12.830 --> 01:15.979
Dad, when's this gonna
look like a birdhouse?

01:16.069 --> 01:20.299
Soon, son. Very soon.
Remember, God is in the details,

01:20.390 --> 01:25.299
and details are what makes me
a craftsman - and you a craftsboy.

01:27.630 --> 01:30.420
- So, what are you making now?
- A fireplace.

01:30.509 --> 01:31.900
A fireplace.

01:31.989 --> 01:36.229
Yes. Even birds need a place
to put their bowling trophies on.

01:38.229 --> 01:41.580
You know what?
I have some really cute little lace curtains

01:41.670 --> 01:46.299
from an old dollhouse in the attic I was
saving for the daughter we never had.

01:46.390 --> 01:49.259
No, no. This is a man's birdhouse.

01:49.350 --> 01:51.940
The next thing we put in
is a leather recliner,

01:52.029 --> 01:55.420
so that little bird can kick back,
put his thin little legs on the ottoman,

01:55.509 --> 01:59.700
pick up the paper, read it, put it back
on the floor, and poop on the paper.

02:01.309 --> 02:03.299
Well, you're the expert.

02:03.910 --> 02:04.890
All right.

02:04.989 --> 02:07.700
Mark, this has got to dry
for about 30 minutes,

02:07.789 --> 02:12.100
and then we install the Jacuzzi.

02:12.190 --> 02:14.299
You know, I could live in this house.

02:14.390 --> 02:17.340
You got the legs for it.

02:17.430 --> 02:19.700
Tim, I want your opinion
about a dress.

02:19.789 --> 02:23.299
Save yourself. Run. Go now. Run!
It's too late for me. Get out of here! Go!

02:23.390 --> 02:27.299
- I'll distract her.
- Very cute. Which dress do you like?

02:27.390 --> 02:29.539
Either one.
They both look nice.

02:29.630 --> 02:32.380
I don't wanna look nice.
I wanna look different.

02:32.469 --> 02:35.420
Put 'em both on.
Go for that layered look.

02:36.830 --> 02:40.370
Come on, Tim, I want to make
an impression at this opera fundraiser.

02:40.469 --> 02:42.769
When are you going to
an opera fundraiser?

02:42.870 --> 02:46.819
- We're going. Saturday night.
- Saturday night?

02:46.910 --> 02:48.860
Yeah. I told you about this
Wednesday morning.

02:48.950 --> 02:51.330
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I most certainly did.

02:51.430 --> 02:54.739
- You just weren't listening, as usual.
- Oh, wasn't listening.

02:54.830 --> 02:56.819
Why don't you repeat these things?

02:56.910 --> 02:59.660
Evey time you say something important,
you're walking out of the room.

02:59.749 --> 03:02.209
"Honey, by the way, this is very important."

03:02.309 --> 03:05.059
"The health of our family relies on this…
fa-fa-fa-fa-fa…

03:05.150 --> 03:07.140
Saturday night."

03:08.749 --> 03:10.739
Well, did you keep Saturday night open?

03:10.830 --> 03:13.259
Why should I? I didn't know
what all that fa-fa-fa-fa-fa was.

03:13.350 --> 03:15.620
- Why didn't you ask me?
- Why didn't you repeat it?

03:15.709 --> 03:17.700
I'm repeating it now.
We're going.

03:17.789 --> 03:20.580
- Oh, man!
- Oh, come on, Tim.

03:20.670 --> 03:24.059
It's gonna be lovely. They're singing
highlights from The Barber of Seville.

03:24.150 --> 03:26.450
A stage full of
300-pound porkers going,

03:26.549 --> 03:29.299
<i>I got a big haircut</i>
<i>I got a big haircut</i>

03:30.309 --> 03:32.299
<i>They screwed up my bangs</i>

03:32.390 --> 03:35.380
<i>You should have used conditioner</i>
<i>You should have used conditioner</i>

03:40.430 --> 03:41.650
We're going.

03:41.749 --> 03:46.979
I almost forgot. Don't forget to pick up
the boutonniere and a corsage for… tomorrow!

03:47.789 --> 03:50.499
<i>I didn't hear you</i>
<i>I didn't hear you</i>

03:51.430 --> 03:55.299
Spring is around the corner, Al,
what do you look for ward to at springtime?

03:55.390 --> 03:58.380
Turning my clock ahead, Tim.

04:01.069 --> 04:03.370
You party animal, you, Al.

04:04.390 --> 04:08.009
When most people think of spring,
they think of spring-cleaning.

04:08.110 --> 04:11.729
And nothing more important
than cleaning your engine. Lisa?

04:11.830 --> 04:15.420
What Al and Lisa are pushing out here
is the engine out of my wife's car.

04:15.509 --> 04:19.499
Just kidding. This is a very filthy
5-liter V-8, chrome valve covers,

04:19.589 --> 04:21.860
aluminum high-rise,
and a four-barrel carburettor.

04:21.950 --> 04:23.580
- There you go, Tim.
- Thank you, Lisa.

04:23.670 --> 04:28.459
After a long, hard winter, you wanna gap
your plugs, flush your dirty radiator clean,

04:28.549 --> 04:33.340
- and make sure your hose doesn't leak.
- Let's not get too personal, Al.

04:34.229 --> 04:37.979
first I wanna degrease this bad boy
using Binford's new Engine Clean.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.059
It's perfect for home, auto and airplane.

04:40.150 --> 04:44.459
All you gotta do is spray it on a hot engine,
rinse it off with ordinary tap water.

04:44.549 --> 04:46.850
At this point
your wife may look at you going,

04:46.950 --> 04:50.340
"What are you doing, cleaning
that dirty old engine, you dumb ox?"

04:50.430 --> 04:52.180
"The floor needs cleaning."

04:52.269 --> 04:55.620
At this point, usually
I take the hood and go: dink.

04:56.749 --> 05:00.019
That's Tim Taylor,
care of Tool Time,

05:00.110 --> 05:02.259
- P.O. Box 32733…
- Al, Al, Al.

05:02.350 --> 05:05.660
I think the women know
that I'm just joshing.

05:05.749 --> 05:08.539
And besides, why would a woman
look under the hood of a car?

05:08.630 --> 05:11.340
We don't look
under the washing machine, do we?

05:11.430 --> 05:14.420
That's P.O. Box 32733,

05:16.069 --> 05:19.140
Detroit… MI.

05:19.229 --> 05:23.539
Anyway, the way a man treats his machine
says something about the man.

05:23.630 --> 05:26.940
It says pride - pride in workmanship,
and that's what it's all about.

05:27.029 --> 05:28.420
You tell 'em, junior.

05:28.509 --> 05:30.969
I like that enthusiasm.
Know what I'm talking about?

05:31.069 --> 05:35.059
I sure do. Me and my partner here,
we've been building cars for 42 years.

05:35.150 --> 05:36.700
- No kidding?
- No. It's true.

05:36.789 --> 05:39.819
We were on the assembly line
at the Dearborn plant on Miller Road.

05:39.910 --> 05:45.299
Let's talk to these mo American workers.
Let's get 'em down here. Come on, guys.

05:49.830 --> 05:51.819
Come on.

05:52.709 --> 05:56.700
- Hey, are we really on TV?
- Well, these aren't hair dyers, pal.

05:56.789 --> 05:59.299
- Yeah, you're on TV.
- Do we get Tool Time hats?

05:59.390 --> 06:02.420
Well, I don't have any with me, but…
Al, let's get mo hats for 'em.

06:02.509 --> 06:03.900
Gentlemen, what are your names?

06:03.989 --> 06:06.219
- I'm Hick Peterson.
- Hello, Hick. How you doin'?

06:06.309 --> 06:09.660
- Eddie Phillips.
- Welcome to Tool Time. This is Al.

06:09.749 --> 06:13.180
- We know Al.
- Oh, we love Al.

06:13.269 --> 06:15.180
We all love Al.

06:15.269 --> 06:19.620
Hey, Al, come on,
give us one of them big salutes.

06:22.789 --> 06:24.499
Al, Al, Al, Al, Al…

06:24.590 --> 06:27.150
Hey! Hey! Hey!

06:27.229 --> 06:29.059
,   .

06:29.150 --> 06:31.779
I don't want to disturb
this love fest you have going here,

06:31.870 --> 06:38.100
but let me remind you of something:
Al is my assistant. He assists me.

06:38.190 --> 06:41.620
Gentlemen, what do you say
we sit down and chat a little bit?

06:41.709 --> 06:45.489
All week long we've been doing
our salute to workmanship.

06:45.590 --> 06:50.499
Who'd know more about that than you mo?
40-odd years on the line. What did you do?

06:50.590 --> 06:55.019
Hick here was headlight alignment,
and I was rear bumpers.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.819
from the beginning to the end. Cool.

06:57.910 --> 07:03.059
42 years on the line, you must've
pushed out some good Detroit iron.

07:03.150 --> 07:07.259
Let me ask you this. In all those years,
what was your favorite car?

07:07.350 --> 07:10.620
- '55 Thunderbird.
- No doubt about it, the Bird.

07:10.709 --> 07:13.580
ford's answer to the Corvette.
It was a mo-seater. It had…

07:13.670 --> 07:18.100
- V-8 engine, 3-speed overdrive.
- front suspension, A-arms, coil springs.

07:18.190 --> 07:22.580
With that power-to-weight ratio,
you could do zero to 60 in ten seconds.

07:25.309 --> 07:27.819
A good grunt always cleans me out.

07:28.309 --> 07:31.700
It must've been a great day,
watching that first T-Bird roll off that line.

07:31.789 --> 07:35.019
Great day.
But they were all good days back then.

07:35.110 --> 07:37.940
You know, we used to knock out
about 100 cars a day.

07:38.029 --> 07:41.219
And after work, Hick and me,
we'd go down and have a stinky.

07:41.309 --> 07:43.299
- Stinky?
- It's a sandwich.

07:43.390 --> 07:46.299
My own invention -
Limburger cheese, sauerkraut,

07:46.390 --> 07:50.090
big slice of Bermuda onion,
and some hot mustard.

07:50.789 --> 07:54.299
Why don't you just lick a skunk?

07:54.390 --> 07:57.979
And, Tim, they still make
a great stinky at…

07:59.190 --> 08:03.459
down at Big Mike's Tavern
at fourth and Jefferson!

08:03.549 --> 08:07.539
- Hey, that ought to take care of our tab.
- Yeah, right. Hi, Mike.

08:07.630 --> 08:11.170
Big Mike's Tavern.
Boy, that sounds like a man's bar there.

08:11.269 --> 08:16.539
You know it, junior.
Pool tables, dark wood, American beer.

08:16.630 --> 08:20.330
We go there all the time,
fourth and Jefferson!

08:20.430 --> 08:24.100
All right. That's all the time we have
for Tool Time this week.

08:24.190 --> 08:28.900
Al, what do you say we give these mo
American workers a Tool Time salute?

08:28.989 --> 08:30.299
Thank you.

08:30.390 --> 08:34.090
And remember, men build machines,
they don't build themselves.

08:34.190 --> 08:36.620
So next time you see
a '55 T-Bird, remember -

08:36.708 --> 08:40.539
this is the face of the man
who installed that bumper,

08:40.630 --> 08:44.979
and this is the face of the man
that aligned the headlights.

08:50.630 --> 08:54.140
Remember, if you didn't put it together
with your own hands, it's not really yours.

08:54.229 --> 08:56.420
See you next time on Tool Time.

09:05.309 --> 09:09.660
- Hey, pea-brain, what are you doing?
- Getting a piece of bread to feed the birds.

09:09.749 --> 09:12.860
You doofus. Birds don't eat bread.
They eat worms.

09:12.950 --> 09:15.900
- You have to do what a mommy bird does.
- What's that?

09:15.989 --> 09:20.100
Chew up the worms
and spit it into the baby bird's mouth.

09:20.190 --> 09:23.809
Eww. I'm not eating any worms.

09:23.910 --> 09:27.610
Well, if you want
the baby birds to starve…

09:27.709 --> 09:31.249
- Maybe I could just eat one worm.
- Now you're talking.

09:31.350 --> 09:35.019
- Hey, guys, where are you going?
- Outside to feed the birds.

09:35.110 --> 09:38.809
I'm gonna chew up the worm,
just like the mommy bird.

09:38.910 --> 09:43.930
No, you're not, Brad, Randy,
I believe you mo have homework to do.

09:45.229 --> 09:49.100
Mark, just spread the bread around
for the birds, OK?

09:53.350 --> 09:55.299
- Hi.
- Hi. How was your show?

09:55.390 --> 09:59.170
Terrific. I heard about a new restaurant,
Big Mike's Tavern.

09:59.269 --> 10:02.660
I thought we'd go down there this weekend.
What night would be good?

10:02.749 --> 10:07.019
Forget it.
We are going to the opera fundraiser.

10:07.110 --> 10:09.410
- Oh, man!
- Come here. I'm really excited.

10:09.509 --> 10:15.059
I found the perfect thing to wear.
It's a little daring, but I think it's fun.

10:16.870 --> 10:19.249
- A tuxedo?
- Yeah. What do you think?

10:20.789 --> 10:21.850
What's so funny?

10:21.950 --> 10:24.739
I've just never been out
with a maître d' before.

10:26.189 --> 10:29.020
Why'd I bother to show you this?
You don't care about this fundraiser.

10:29.109 --> 10:30.360
It's not that I don't care.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.620
I'm just tired of you making
these big plans without telling me.

10:33.710 --> 10:36.899
Hold on. This whole thing
was your idea in the first place.

10:36.989 --> 10:38.419
- What?
- Yes.

10:38.509 --> 10:41.020
Mrs Larson asked us
at church mo months ago,

10:41.109 --> 10:45.140
- and you said, "Yeah, we'd love to come."
- I didn't mean that. I was being polite.

10:45.230 --> 10:48.620
She thought you meant it. I thought you
meant it. You should say what you mean.

10:48.710 --> 10:51.460
- Like you do.
- Yes, like I do.

10:51.549 --> 10:56.299
Wasn't it you that said Mrs Larson looked
"just hideous" in that purple muumuu?

10:56.390 --> 11:01.899
Well, she did look hideous.
She looked like a giant eggplant. So?

11:01.989 --> 11:06.140
But when she comes over a second time,
you said, "Mrs Larson, you look lovely."

11:06.230 --> 11:10.899
Why don't you say what you mean?
"You look hideous, you big fat muumuu."

11:10.989 --> 11:12.739
She didn't ask me
if she looked hideous.

11:12.830 --> 11:14.980
She asked you
if we were going to the fundraiser.

11:15.069 --> 11:18.140
- You said yes, so she sent the tickets.
- Why didn't you just tell me?

11:18.230 --> 11:21.100
I did tell you.
Tim, I told you three times.

11:21.189 --> 11:25.859
I'm not stupid. If you'd told me three times,
I'd remember saying no three times.

11:25.950 --> 11:28.580
- Are you saying you're not gonna go?
- No. This'll be the fourth time.

11:28.669 --> 11:31.859
fine. I'll just put a dress under my tux
and take myself.

11:44.589 --> 11:48.460
Here you go.
One brewski, one buttermilk.

11:48.549 --> 11:53.489
A toast to Mike. Here's to your health
and to your happiness, sir.

11:53.589 --> 11:57.339
- How about paying your tab?
- And to your fine generosity.

11:57.430 --> 12:00.700
- That'll be $3.
- We take back our toast.

12:02.390 --> 12:06.980
Hey, everybody, look who's here.
Tim "the tool man" Taylor.

12:07.069 --> 12:10.819
- Hello, Tim.
- Hi, guys. Hi, everybody.

12:10.910 --> 12:12.819
That's Mike over there, behind the bar.

12:12.910 --> 12:15.339
- Hi, Mike. How you doing?
- Good to meet you, Tim.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.700
Good to my word,
I brought you guys some hats.

12:17.790 --> 12:19.819
Oh, man! Thanks a million.

12:19.910 --> 12:22.580
We promised you a stinky.
Mike, fix him a nice big one.

12:22.669 --> 12:24.660
- Coming right up.
- Mike, don't bother.

12:24.750 --> 12:28.180
It's not gonna bother me.
I'm not the one eating it.

12:28.270 --> 12:30.540
Hey, we're glad you dropped by.

12:30.629 --> 12:33.899
You know, a bunch of guys we used to
work with are gonna be here tonight.

12:33.989 --> 12:36.980
- Boy, would they love to meet you.
- I'd love to, but not tonight.

12:37.069 --> 12:40.689
I believe my wife is dragging me to
the Michigan Opera Theater fundraiser.

12:40.790 --> 12:42.140
- Don't do it.
- What?

12:42.230 --> 12:46.660
Just put your foot down and say,
"Woman, I'm not going."

12:47.910 --> 12:52.339
Now, you see, that's the attitude
that kept you a bachelor all your life.

12:52.430 --> 12:55.060
Of course, your face
didn't help much either.

12:56.390 --> 12:59.419
The ladies down at the senior center
don't seem to mind.

12:59.509 --> 13:02.939
You should see me
at those Saturday night dances, boy.

13:03.029 --> 13:04.819
- Sit down.
- All right, Eddie. Just for a minute.

13:04.910 --> 13:08.379
So what if it's the opera?
Look on the good side of it.

13:08.469 --> 13:12.980
You're gonna get to see your wife
all dolled up in a beautiful gown.

13:13.069 --> 13:15.259
She wants to wear a tux.

13:15.350 --> 13:17.620
I hate to see a woman
wearing pants.

13:17.710 --> 13:20.779
You know, down at the senior center
I won't even dance with a woman

13:20.870 --> 13:24.859
unless she's wearing nylons with
a nice seam right up the back of her legs.

13:24.950 --> 13:28.020
Those aren't seams.
Those are veins.

13:29.669 --> 13:33.819
My point is, Tim, that in the old days
women wore dresses.

13:33.910 --> 13:36.210
And they hung onto your arm
on a Saturday night,

13:36.310 --> 13:39.100
And they liked it
when you called them "dame".

13:39.189 --> 13:42.969
I don't think Jill would like it
if I called her "dame".

13:43.069 --> 13:46.460
Dame, doll, gal, babe -
whatever she likes.

13:46.549 --> 13:48.700
That's good advice,
but I really do gotta get movin'.

13:48.790 --> 13:51.500
- Hey, you haven't had your stinky yet.
- You have it.

13:51.589 --> 13:54.819
- We haven't solved your problem yet.
- I came in with hats, not a problem.

13:54.910 --> 13:59.379
Your wife's making you go someplace you
don't want to go, she wears men's clothes,

13:59.469 --> 14:01.700
and you're telling us
you don't have a problem?

14:03.910 --> 14:05.100
The problem is,

14:05.189 --> 14:08.540
until yesterday, I don't think she ever
told me, "We're going to a fundraiser."

14:08.629 --> 14:10.540
- That's a woman for you.
- The crazy thing is,

14:10.629 --> 14:13.500
she tells me she said it three times,
and I know she didn't.

14:13.589 --> 14:17.259
Women like to control men,
and they do it by confusing them.

14:17.350 --> 14:22.140
By changing the rules around,
like wantin' to wear men's clothes.

14:22.230 --> 14:25.739
Tim, you've got to fight confusion
with confusion.

14:27.710 --> 14:31.460
You go home and you put on
one of her dresses.

14:34.989 --> 14:36.980
You want this man to wear a dress?

14:37.069 --> 14:39.500
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

14:39.589 --> 14:41.620
Don't listen to that old windbag.

14:41.710 --> 14:43.859
Listen, I was married for 45 years,

14:43.950 --> 14:48.180
and the one thing I learned was
that men and women are different.

14:48.270 --> 14:50.730
It took him 45 years to figure that out.

14:51.989 --> 14:54.450
All I'm saying is
that women are subtle.

14:54.549 --> 14:58.020
Your wife probably told you
about this evening in her own way.

14:58.109 --> 15:01.100
No. Absolutely not.
If she'd told me, I would have remembered.

15:01.189 --> 15:04.580
Think, think. She never said
anything about a fundraiser?

15:04.669 --> 15:07.180
No. She said,
"I'm gonna dry-clean your tuxedo,"

15:07.270 --> 15:09.540
and something about
Saturday hors d'oeuvres.

15:09.629 --> 15:13.700
But I mean written something down
on paper or a calendar?

15:13.790 --> 15:18.180
Our calendar is circled on Saturday,
but all she wrote was "fur raisins".

15:18.270 --> 15:20.569
fur raisins.

15:23.310 --> 15:28.219
- Could that be "fundraiser"?
- Oh, no.

15:29.989 --> 15:31.660
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

15:31.710 --> 15:34.899
I thought you were gonna paint that
birdhouse stand when your dad got home.

15:34.989 --> 15:36.980
I wanted it to be a surprise.

15:37.069 --> 15:40.819
- How many coats of paint did you put on?
- 12.

15:40.910 --> 15:44.899
Yeah.
He's gonna be real surprised.

15:44.989 --> 15:50.140
Why don't you get cleaned up, and I'll
clean your brush out for you, all right?

15:50.230 --> 15:52.219
OK.

15:52.870 --> 15:56.410
Don't touch anything
on your way up, OK?

16:00.230 --> 16:04.339
- Hey, Wilson.
- Hi-ho, lady neighbor.

16:05.790 --> 16:10.910
- What are you doing over there?
- Just letting off a little bit of steam, Jill.

16:10.989 --> 16:15.460
Nothing relaxes me more
than a good game of croquet.

16:17.189 --> 16:21.660
- Can I ask you something?
- Step up to the wicket, Jill.

16:21.750 --> 16:24.310
Do you think that Tim
is a good listener?

16:24.390 --> 16:29.779
- Yes. I think Tim is a very good listener.
- Does he understand everything you say?

16:30.629 --> 16:33.500
I think Tim is a very good listener.

16:34.509 --> 16:36.969
I don't think he listens to me at all.

16:37.069 --> 16:39.939
I told him about this event
that we're going to three times,

16:40.029 --> 16:42.620
and he acts like
I never said anything.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.859
I don't know how
I could have been clearer.

16:44.950 --> 16:47.140
I told him
I was getting his tux cleaned.

16:47.230 --> 16:50.339
I told him about the hors d'oeuvres
we were having Saturday night.

16:50.430 --> 16:54.939
I even circled it on the calendar. I did
everything except sit him down and say,

16:55.029 --> 16:59.620
"Tim, we are going to a fundraiser
Saturday night." Oh God, I never did that.

17:01.390 --> 17:04.259
Oh, man!

17:05.430 --> 17:07.419
I can't believe it.

17:08.628 --> 17:12.020
All of this arguing,
and he was right.

17:12.108 --> 17:17.230
Oh, no. I feel terrible. This is all my fault.
Well, I should apologize to him.

17:17.310 --> 17:20.579
Thank you, Wilson.
You've really been a big help.

17:21.710 --> 17:24.779
Somehow it's always
easier with Jill.

17:30.669 --> 17:33.859
Honey, I'm so glad you're home.
I've got to tell you something.

17:33.950 --> 17:36.779
- I've got something important to tell you.
- Let me go first.

17:36.870 --> 17:40.569
- No, please, let me. Come on.
- All right.

17:40.669 --> 17:44.819
I realized today that you probably
did tell me about this fundraiser.

17:44.910 --> 17:48.259
Not outright, but in your subtle way,
you said it mo or three times.

17:48.350 --> 17:51.339
When I'm not interested in something,
I don't pay attention.

17:51.430 --> 17:54.379
It's my fault. I'm sorry, and I apologize.

17:56.069 --> 17:58.939
- Thank you, sweetie.
- We'll have a good time.

17:59.029 --> 18:01.700
Now, what were you gonna tell me?

18:07.149 --> 18:08.739
Nothing.

18:09.710 --> 18:12.089
- See ya, guys.
- Take it easy.

18:13.469 --> 18:15.850
It was nice seeing Ziggy again.

18:15.950 --> 18:18.939
- Boy, has he gone to the dogs.
- Yeah.

18:19.029 --> 18:22.899
I hate it when a guy
doesn't keep himself up.

18:25.549 --> 18:30.700
Hey! Look who's here.
I thought you had an event to go to.

18:30.790 --> 18:33.419
Well, my wife and I
communicated and compromised

18:33.509 --> 18:37.500
and decided to spend half the night at
the fundraiser and the other half with you.

18:37.589 --> 18:40.020
- All right!
- And we're starving.

18:40.109 --> 18:42.100
fix you up a couple of stinkies?

18:43.390 --> 18:45.770
No. Still lovin' that one I had today.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.460
- Just your shrimp plate and a big salad.
- You got it.

18:49.549 --> 18:52.419
I'm sorry, guys.
Hick, Eddie, this is my wife, Jill.

18:52.509 --> 18:55.180
Its a great pleasure
to meet you, my dear.

18:55.270 --> 18:57.620
Why, thank you very much.

18:57.710 --> 19:01.489
My, my, my, my, my.

19:01.589 --> 19:04.460
I love a woman in a tuxedo.

19:06.549 --> 19:08.850
I thought you said
you didn't like women in pants.

19:08.950 --> 19:10.939
- Did I say that, junior?
- Yes.

19:11.029 --> 19:14.339
Well, it's OK
if it's a glamor package like Jill here.

19:14.430 --> 19:16.989
Well, thank you.

19:17.430 --> 19:20.460
You are one classy dame.

19:20.549 --> 19:25.379
- And you are trouble.
- And you know it.

19:25.469 --> 19:30.259
How about tripping the light fandango
with me, if your husband doesn't mind?

19:30.350 --> 19:32.460
You don't mind, do you, junior?

19:32.549 --> 19:35.700
- Junior? No, go ahead.
- OK.

19:35.790 --> 19:37.299
Watch his hands.

19:37.390 --> 19:41.980
I got a step I do down at the senior center
I think you're gonna like.

19:44.469 --> 19:46.819
Now, then.

19:46.910 --> 19:50.020
How would you like to be in my will?

19:52.069 --> 19:56.419
- Your wife certainly lights up a room.
- Yes, she certainly does.

19:56.509 --> 19:59.580
I'm glad to see that
the mo of you worked things out.

19:59.669 --> 20:03.980
Well, I don't know
how we worked things out. I apologized.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.580
I just don't think
I'm ever gonna figure her out.

20:06.669 --> 20:08.180
Don't.

20:08.270 --> 20:12.180
You know,
I was married to Tildy for 45 years,

20:12.270 --> 20:19.460
and this woman - God rest her soul -
used to drive me absolutely crazy.

20:19.549 --> 20:23.500
She had these
ugly little porcelain cats

20:23.589 --> 20:27.859
that she used to love
to line up on the window sill.

20:29.109 --> 20:33.020
And every day for 45 years

20:33.109 --> 20:40.500
I used to take those cats off the window sill
and put 'em in a cupboard.

20:40.589 --> 20:44.210
And every day for 45 years

20:44.310 --> 20:48.819
she'd take 'em out of the cupboard
and put 'em back.

20:51.469 --> 20:55.939
- Where are they now?
- On the window sill.

20:56.469 --> 21:00.980
- You didn't throw them out?
- What for?

21:02.310 --> 21:03.939
You know,

21:04.029 --> 21:08.219
you don't have to
understand a woman.

21:08.310 --> 21:11.259
All you got to do is love her.

21:14.549 --> 21:18.060
Hey. You get up there. Come on.

21:24.989 --> 21:28.379
- Mind if I cut in?
- Is it all right with you?

21:28.469 --> 21:30.460
Well, OK.

21:31.270 --> 21:33.700
,   .

22:14.189 --> 22:16.779
I finished the birdhouse.
Look.

22:16.870 --> 22:19.620
Tim, they're just sitting on the tree.
Why don't they go in?

22:19.710 --> 22:23.100
He's thinking, "The house is way
too expensive. I'd have to win the lottery."

22:23.189 --> 22:26.140
- "I cant pick up a ticket with claws."
- I don't think so.

22:26.230 --> 22:28.859
He sees the Jacuzzi,
and fresh papers everywhere.

22:28.950 --> 22:32.140
Nah. He's saying, "forget the papers.
Let's find a statue of Tim."

22:33.710 --> 22:35.299
Oh, look, a cat.

22:35.390 --> 22:37.180
Just kidding, fellas.
