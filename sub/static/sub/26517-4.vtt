Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...I still love you, Nathaniel.

REBECCA:
We just don't have the same

00:06.136 --> 00:08.443
priorities right now.Every time we're happy,

00:08.486 --> 00:09.835
you try to ruin it.

00:09.879 --> 00:11.402
You don't have to be a lawyer.

00:11.446 --> 00:13.274
There are other fields.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.102
REBECCA:
That's what happy looks like.

00:15.145 --> 00:17.495
I'm thinking of calling it
"Rebetzels."

00:17.539 --> 00:18.583
NAOMI:
I'm sure you told your father

00:18.627 --> 00:20.368
at Tucker's
seventh birthday party.

00:20.411 --> 00:21.586
SILAS:
I need to borrow some cash.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.197
AKOPIAN:
For his son's braces?

00:23.240 --> 00:24.676
Here is a check for Tucker.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.287
Do you think I'm a bad mom?

00:26.330 --> 00:27.636
You're not the most
attentive parent.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.159
Can I get a tattoo?

00:29.203 --> 00:30.856
Just a small blueprint
of the local prison.Yeah, okay.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.467
That's bad advice, Mom.

00:32.510 --> 00:33.381
Brendan's my weed guy.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.426
I'm thinking of that great song

00:35.470 --> 00:36.645
from the movie Slumbered.

00:36.688 --> 00:40.431

00:47.438 --> 00:48.657
When you find the one you love,

00:48.700 --> 00:49.788
you should hold on tight.

00:49.832 --> 00:51.660
I got to get her back.

I hate you!

01:33.484 --> 01:35.095
You're the worst mom ever!

01:49.152 --> 01:50.110
REBECCA:
Hey, Tucker.

01:50.153 --> 01:51.589
It's your big sister Rebecca.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.156
For your birthday, I got you

01:53.200 --> 01:56.681
a cool pair of limited edition
Fett Regoso sneakers.

01:56.725 --> 01:58.248
Hope you like them.

01:58.292 --> 02:00.990
If you don't, feel free
to sell them for drugs.

02:01.033 --> 02:03.993
Ha, ha. Kidding.
Don't do drugs.

02:04.036 --> 02:06.561
I know this gift is out of
the blue since we haven't

02:06.604 --> 02:10.304
seen each other since Grandpa
Bobo's funeral years ago.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.697
I'm sorry so much time
has gone by.

02:12.741 --> 02:17.093
I'm in a better place now
and taking stock of my life.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.140
I've been through a lot,
but I've turned a corner.

02:20.183 --> 02:23.099
And I hope someday we can
get to know each other.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.361
Whenever you're ready,

02:24.405 --> 02:27.712
I'm out here in L.A.
No pressure.

02:27.756 --> 02:31.586
Love, your sis, Rebecca Bunch.

02:31.629 --> 02:35.067
P.S. Hope these sneakers
make you truly happy.

02:35.111 --> 02:38.070
:
Happy, happy, happy....

02:42.727 --> 02:44.294
REBECCA:
I sent him a card and gift.

02:44.338 --> 02:45.817
Anyway, I'll probably
never hear back from him,

02:45.861 --> 02:47.906
but I owed Tucker
that letter.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.952
You know, I really want
to make things right with him.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.301
If not now, then someday.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.956
And he's kind of
the last person in my life

02:53.999 --> 02:55.566
that I have unfinished business
with, you know?

02:55.610 --> 02:58.003
Really

02:58.047 --> 02:59.309
Your father.

02:59.353 --> 03:00.702
Audra Levine-- Ooh!

03:00.745 --> 03:02.312
The professor whose house
you almost burned down.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.401
And I really think that
we should circle back to Greg

03:04.445 --> 03:05.881
at some point...Uh, yeah.

03:05.924 --> 03:08.927
Hey, boys, your pretzels
are fresh out of the oven.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.233
We'll talk about that
later, okay?

03:10.277 --> 03:12.801
Hey!
Isn't this cool, guys?

03:12.844 --> 03:15.020
Our friend owns a pretzel stand.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.457
Uh-huh.
It's fun, right?

03:16.500 --> 03:17.806
REBECCA:
Yeah!

03:17.849 --> 03:19.677
What do you think, guys?
Best ever?

03:19.721 --> 03:21.157
It's fine.It's kind of dry.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.159
Hey.REBECCA: Tommy.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.987
Uh, I love your Fett Regoso hat.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.685
I'm a massive
Fett Regoso fan.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.687
Like, I've been a fan of his
from the '90s.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.602
And I'm so glad he's having
a revival now, right?

03:33.300 --> 03:35.432
I am so sorry,
they are such lumps.BRENDAN: Mom.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.173
Come on. Just give
me the car keys.

03:37.217 --> 03:41.133
Fine. But drive safe.

03:41.177 --> 03:45.268
Make sure you stop the car
when you drop Tommy off.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.444
A slow roll through
the carpool lane doesn't cut it.

03:47.488 --> 03:48.663
Okay.

03:48.706 --> 03:51.622
Yeah, drive safe.
Or recklessly.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.363
Whichever makes
me cooler.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.672
No, don't turn around.
This is too fun.
I'm sorry.

03:57.715 --> 03:59.587
They should be
nicer to you.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.719
It's-- I don't know,
teenagers are tough.

04:01.763 --> 04:04.809
Yeah, no, listen, it's a phase;
you'll get through it.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.811
You're a great mom and
they're ultimately good kids.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.335
Hmm, basically.

04:08.378 --> 04:09.814
I mean, Tommy's
not the brightest...
No.

04:09.858 --> 04:13.383
...and Brendan's an isolated
loner, but I love them?

04:13.427 --> 04:15.820
All right, bye.
Bye.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.605
BOTH: Mwah, mwah.PAULA: See you later.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.171
You know, it's interesting.

04:19.215 --> 04:21.173
When I was a teenager,
my mother and I,

04:21.217 --> 04:22.566
we didn't connect at all.

04:22.610 --> 04:23.698
She really only
wanted to talk about

04:23.741 --> 04:26.744
her concerns,
and I was too young

04:26.788 --> 04:28.616
to weigh in on
vaginal rejuvenation.

04:28.659 --> 04:31.836
Yeah, uh, I hear you.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.143
Truth is, I don't talk about
this a lot,

04:34.186 --> 04:36.188
but my mother and I
have been estranged for...You know,

04:36.232 --> 04:38.060
sometimes I just wish
I could go back in time.

04:38.103 --> 04:40.062
And back to you, okay.And I would tell

04:40.105 --> 04:43.718
little Rebecca that
it's all gonna be okay.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.633
That, yes, people don't
understand who she really is

04:45.676 --> 04:48.766
inside, but she's
wonderful and special

04:48.810 --> 04:51.203
and she's worth...CHILD: Hello?

04:51.247 --> 04:52.857
Excuse me.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.773
Tucker?

04:55.817 --> 04:56.861
What are-- Oh, my God.

04:56.905 --> 04:59.603
Oh, my God, you're here! Hi!

04:59.647 --> 05:02.389
I got your card and your
gift; I came to visit.

05:02.432 --> 05:03.955
This is unbelievable.
Um, AJ, AJ!

05:03.999 --> 05:06.610
This is my little half brother--

05:06.654 --> 05:08.830
No, no. My whole brother.
This is my brother.

05:08.873 --> 05:11.702
So, this is the spawn
of your father's whore?

05:11.746 --> 05:13.356
AJ.
That's okay.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.705
I've heard that before.

05:14.749 --> 05:17.882
You said that to my face
on my seventh birthday.

05:17.926 --> 05:20.407
Yeah. Right.
I'm the worst.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.539
So, um, hey.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.324
Is your mom here?

05:24.367 --> 05:27.327
Oh, she said she told you
I was coming on my own.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.503
She said she called you.

05:29.546 --> 05:30.895
You didn't get her voice mails?

05:30.939 --> 05:33.158
Oh, God, I don't listen
to voice mail, I'm sorry.

05:33.202 --> 05:35.030
M-My outgoing message is.
"Seriously, don't,"

05:35.073 --> 05:36.205
and then just beep.

05:36.248 --> 05:38.686
Oh, no, I'm-I'm
springing myself on you.

05:38.729 --> 05:41.123
That is so rude.
I-I'll go home.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.038
Tucker, stop.
You're not going anywhere.

05:43.081 --> 05:44.387
This is great; this is amazing.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.910
I don't even know
where to begin, uh--

05:45.954 --> 05:46.998
What's your favorite pretzel?

05:47.042 --> 05:48.086
You can have
any pretzel you like.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.132
I own the place.
I'm Rebetzel.

05:50.175 --> 05:51.873
Wait. This is
your pretzel stand?

05:51.916 --> 05:53.788
I love pretzels!

05:53.831 --> 05:55.572
They're like a funky treat
for teens.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.574
Oh, my God, that's what
I always used to say.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.359
Really? Gasp.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.273
Wait. You say "gasp"?
I say "gasp."

06:01.317 --> 06:02.971
BOTH:
Gasp.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.495
Whoa. Okay.

06:05.539 --> 06:06.714
We got a lot of
catching up to do.

06:06.757 --> 06:08.019
Let's just,
let's get out of here.

06:08.063 --> 06:08.933
AJ, you're in charge.
Think you can handle it?

06:08.977 --> 06:11.458
Um, yeah. It's a pretzel stand.

06:11.501 --> 06:14.069
I just flipped the cinnamons.
I'm good until 3:00.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.157
Great.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.898
Great, thanks.

06:16.941 --> 06:20.423
So, you gave up being
a lawyer completely.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.425
Yeah, I mean,
I give free legal advice

06:22.469 --> 06:25.428
at the county jail,
but the job part I don't miss.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.082
So what do you want
to do today...?Hello, Rebecca.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.866
Hey, hi, Nathaniel.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.302
I thought we were not...Please.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.348
Please, I need to say something
very important to you.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.871
But first,
little boy, move aside.

06:33.915 --> 06:36.570
We have no money for your
youth club overpriced candy.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.485
No, this is my
brother, Tucker.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.138
And he's in town for...I said--

06:40.182 --> 06:42.010
Please.
For... What?

06:42.053 --> 06:44.926
Look, I, Rebecca,
I need to say this, okay?

06:44.969 --> 06:47.232
You and I belong together.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.538
And that's just a fact.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.801
I love you; you love me.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.455
The sooner you get used to it,

06:52.499 --> 06:54.544
I think the easier and better
it'll be for everyone.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.459
Look, yes, I still have
feelings for you

06:56.503 --> 06:58.983
and you still have
feelings for me.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.943
But I just can't, okay?
I'm with child.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.727
You're...?No, I'm with a child.

07:03.771 --> 07:06.556
I'm with a child, my brother,
and he's my focus right now.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.993
But did you hear what I said

07:09.037 --> 07:10.908
I love you.
I...

07:10.952 --> 07:14.390
What else do I have to
say to get you to take me back?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.218
I don't know.

07:16.261 --> 07:19.264
I just don't, I don't know
if you understand me.

07:19.308 --> 07:22.050
Just-just go, go.
Go, Nathaniel.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.355
Okay? Just...
Rebecca.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.053
Ciao, Nathaniel.What are you--

07:25.096 --> 07:26.358
Ciao, bambino.

07:33.714 --> 07:36.020
TUCKER: Whoa, that guy
is so in love with you.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.719
He's very handsome,
and was wearing

07:38.762 --> 07:40.155
a very expensive cologne,

07:40.198 --> 07:41.809
"Take Her," by Fett Regoso.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.593
Which was discontinued
in the '90s

07:43.637 --> 07:45.290
because of its
problematic ad campaign

07:45.334 --> 07:46.596
and is now
a collector's item.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.771
How do you know that?

07:47.815 --> 07:50.121
I have a cologne
collection.

07:50.165 --> 07:52.297
I love you.

07:57.564 --> 08:00.697
Tucker's gonna sleep
on the couch.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.441
So, your mom is just cool
with you flying out here

08:05.485 --> 08:07.965
by yourself to visit
a woman that you barely know?

08:08.009 --> 08:09.140
Yep.

08:09.184 --> 08:11.186
Okay. And what about your dad?

08:11.229 --> 08:13.536
'Cause he and Rebecca
aren't on the best terms.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.059
Oh, my parents
are divorced.

08:15.103 --> 08:17.322
I only see him for a few
weeks in the summer.

08:17.366 --> 08:19.063
He is...

08:19.107 --> 08:20.151
Garbage?

08:20.195 --> 08:21.936
I try not to use bad language,

08:21.979 --> 08:23.546
but you're right.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.809
He is not great.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.291
He never lets me do anything
I want to do.

08:29.334 --> 08:32.816
My summers with him are awful;
he makes me work construction.

08:34.122 --> 08:34.949
You see this callus?

08:34.992 --> 08:36.211
You poor thing.

08:36.254 --> 08:37.908
I also have a Silas callus.

08:37.952 --> 08:40.998
This is from 2005,
building townhouses in Tucson.

08:41.042 --> 08:41.956
Oh, my gosh.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.001
Okay, sorry to break this up.

08:44.045 --> 08:46.177
But have you checked in with
your mom since you got here?

08:46.221 --> 08:48.223
Like, does she know
you arrived safely?

08:48.266 --> 08:49.616
Oh, yeah, I texted her.

08:49.659 --> 08:50.921
No, you know what?
Heather's right.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.183
I really should check in
with your mom.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.272
Sure, you can text her.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.057
Text is best;
she's so busy.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.233
Oh.Excuse me, where's
your bathroom?

08:58.276 --> 09:01.018
Uh, it's right, uh, there.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.545
Okay.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.243
Hey, Marissa, comma,
Rebecca Bunch here, comma.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.898
Just letting you know
Tucker got in safely

09:10.941 --> 09:12.943
and I'll take good care of him.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.729
Also, thank you for ruining
my family and my childhood...

09:15.772 --> 09:18.209
Okay, just delete, delete,
delete, delete.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.907
Yeah.
You're right;
I'm the adult now.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.953
Okay, delete, delete,
delete, send.

09:22.997 --> 09:26.087
Okay, waiting dots.
Waiting dots already.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.829
"Hope you guys have
a great time."

09:28.872 --> 09:29.830
Look at that.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.701
Oh. Okay.
Okay.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.094
Well, that's
settled, then.

09:33.137 --> 09:35.052
Oh, he's such a great kid.

09:35.096 --> 09:38.099
And he really reminds me
of myself at that age, you know?

09:38.142 --> 09:39.361
Hmm.

10:02.950 --> 10:06.954
So, I need a paralegal
to come on to the Yamamoto case.

10:06.997 --> 10:08.651
It's huge.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.479
Lots of hours, tons of overtime.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.568
Please!
Sir, pick me.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.178
I need all the
overtime I can get

10:14.222 --> 10:15.397
to help with my
student loans.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.182
I'm also paying off
my student loans.

10:18.226 --> 10:19.488
Still?

10:19.531 --> 10:20.968
Are you saying I'm old?

10:21.011 --> 10:22.665
You said it;
I don't disagree.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.362
I will make my decision
this week.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.147
It's between you two idiots.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.801
Get out.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.023
He's in a bad mood.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.417
Yeah, he got
Rebected again.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.898
Oh, that's my term for when
he gets rejected by Rebecca.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.769
Spread it around;
make sure I get credit.

10:39.813 --> 10:42.206
I'm getting this case.
I always do.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.252
As my Krav Maga
trainer says,

10:44.295 --> 10:45.819
I'm a mitnakesh.

I get you Rebecca, you give me
the Yamamoto overtime.

11:07.884 --> 11:11.322
"Get me Rebecca"

11:11.366 --> 11:12.933

You don't want to know.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.325

Do you know?

11:14.369 --> 11:16.327
No, no, no.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.721
But, um, I will make it happen.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.941
Great. You do that,
the case is yours.

11:20.984 --> 11:22.594
All right.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.217
I do that, too.

11:36.260 --> 11:40.308
BOTH: Twins. Jinx. Gasp!

11:40.351 --> 11:43.877
Oh, um, that's a little
surprise for you.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.096
I'll just tell you, um, my best
friend has some kids your age,

11:46.140 --> 11:47.402
so I thought
we could all hang out.

PAULA: Hi!REBECCA: Hey!

11:49.491 --> 11:53.538
Oh, hi! You must be Tucker,
I'm Paula.

11:53.582 --> 11:54.757
Hello.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.585
You're adorable.

11:57.847 --> 12:00.545
And you look just like Rebecca.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.373
And these are my boys.

12:03.679 --> 12:05.463
Comatose and Lump.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.335
Hello, nice to meet you.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.902
Hey.
'Sup, cuz?

12:08.945 --> 12:13.210
Okay, so what cool young
thing should we all do today?

12:13.254 --> 12:14.646
Should we, uh,
take a selfie?

Make a meme?
Get lit?

12:16.648 --> 12:18.999
Or should we--
: Yas, queen?

12:19.042 --> 12:20.478
Stop.

12:20.522 --> 12:24.352
Okay, I got tickets for
the new escape room at the mall.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.529
Oh, my God, I've been
wanting to go to that.

12:27.572 --> 12:29.139
I thought it could be fun.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.402
Oh, God, Paula, that-that's
so sweet of you,

12:31.446 --> 12:34.492
it's just, I'm the littlest bit
claustrophobic.

12:34.536 --> 12:35.667
It kind of reminds me

12:35.711 --> 12:37.495
of the scariest movie,
Panic Room.

12:37.539 --> 12:38.845
No, no, no. I used
to be terrified

12:38.888 --> 12:40.194
of the Panic Room,too.

12:40.237 --> 12:41.761
BOTH:
Get out of my house!

12:41.804 --> 12:44.241
Twins! Jinx! Gasp!

12:44.285 --> 12:46.069

Wow.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.637
Okay, well, you guys don't
need us to have a good time.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.726
So, I guess, I'll just take

12:50.770 --> 12:53.773
these screen zombies
to the escape room.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.689
Maybe that'll breathe
some life into them.

12:57.733 --> 12:58.908
Okay, come on.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.041
Let's go.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.739
Get in the car.

All right, we'll
see you guys later.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.569
REBECCA: Okay.Bye.

13:07.612 --> 13:08.962
Have the best time ever.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.485
You know, if you ask me,
you could learn a thing

13:10.528 --> 13:13.401
from Tucker Bunch;
he's a beam of damn sunshine.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.492
Okay.
No biggie.

13:17.535 --> 13:18.710
So what do you want
to do instead?

13:18.754 --> 13:21.061
Well, I've never been
to Los Angeles before.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.932
Maybe there's some
tourist stuff we could do?

13:22.976 --> 13:25.326
That's a great idea.
I actually haven't done

13:25.369 --> 13:26.936
any of the tourist
stuff, either.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.242
I mean, I only go
to a few places

13:28.285 --> 13:30.418
and they're all
in West Covina.

13:30.461 --> 13:33.464
Whitefeather, Sugar Face,
the boba place, Home Base,

13:33.508 --> 13:35.684
Paula's house, although usually
it's just the kitchen.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.599
Hey, I just had an idea.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.035
How about the Hollywood

13:39.079 --> 13:40.471
Walk of Fame?Murder Tour--
Walk of Fame.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.082
We're not on the
same page there...
Oh, yeah.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.040
...but your idea's better;
it's good for kids, yeah.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.259
Great. Let's do it.

13:45.302 --> 13:49.654
I am dying, dying
to see Monty Hall's star.

13:49.698 --> 13:52.048
He's the original host
of Let's Make a Deal.

13:52.092 --> 13:53.615
Wow.

13:53.658 --> 13:56.009
Well, that is a cool,
vintage-y factoid.

13:56.879 --> 13:57.837
Let's go to Hollywood Boulevard.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.274
Yay.

14:07.934 --> 14:11.546
I looked it up online, Monty's
star should be right down there.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.940
Hmm.

14:13.983 --> 14:15.724
Huh, look at that.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.509
I wonder what those
boys are in line for?

14:18.553 --> 14:20.468
Maybe it's like a cool
exhibit or something.

14:20.511 --> 14:21.991
Oh, yeah.
Let's ask that boy
and his mother.

14:22.035 --> 14:23.297
Boy!

14:23.340 --> 14:24.951
Boy, why are you crossing?

14:24.994 --> 14:26.778
Why, don't you know?

14:26.822 --> 14:29.085
They're casting Peter Pan,
the musical.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.391
MOTHER:
Darling, great.

14:30.434 --> 14:31.958
But it's "Peet-ah",
like pita bread,

14:32.001 --> 14:34.134
not "Peet-er"
like Tater Tots.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.657
BOY:
Okay, sorry, Mother.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.964
It's okay.
He takes notes amazingly.

14:38.007 --> 14:42.490
Oh, an audition.
That sounds so fun.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.100
When I was a kid,
I would have killed

14:44.144 --> 14:46.798
to audition for,
like, anything.

14:46.842 --> 14:49.018
I love musicals so much.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.193
Really?

14:50.237 --> 14:52.239
I love them, too.
No way.

14:52.282 --> 14:55.416
My favorite one is this obscure,
off-brand, animated one.

14:55.459 --> 14:56.765
You've probably
never heard of it.

14:56.808 --> 14:57.766
BOTH:
Slumbered.

14:57.809 --> 14:59.550
Get out of my house.

Wait. This is insane.

who loves the movie Slumbered.

15:07.645 --> 15:09.082
Uh, what's your favorite song?

Nestor Asgard.

17:10.681 --> 17:11.682

17:13.989 --> 17:16.861
Okay.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.776
Where do we start?

17:18.820 --> 17:22.737
Maybe with the chest
with the giant, obvious keyhole?

17:22.780 --> 17:24.695
Mom, I don't want
to do this.

17:24.739 --> 17:27.002
I paid good money.
Shut up and participate.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.222
Whatever.

17:35.010 --> 17:38.318
Oh.
Sweet, I found a key.

17:38.361 --> 17:39.884
Well done.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.722
Don't look at me,
I failed cursive.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.507
I mean, who even reads
these scribbles?

17:53.550 --> 17:54.682
What am I, Egyptian?

17:54.725 --> 17:55.944
I don't have my glasses.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.380
Ah, give it to me.

17:57.424 --> 17:58.729
I can read calligraphy 'cause

17:58.773 --> 18:00.253

to tread the boards.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.821
My little brother wants
to audition.

18:46.864 --> 18:47.778
Do you have an appointment?

18:49.040 --> 18:51.391
Yeah. No appointment,
no audition.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.132
Listen, I understand you have
to say that to most people,

18:53.175 --> 18:56.004
but my brother is so talented.Ma'am.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.136
Please step aside.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.876

of problem?

What do you mean?

19:11.106 --> 19:13.195
I'm just togged up
in my glad rags.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.936
Sure.

19:14.979 --> 19:18.853
Hey, so the last time I saw you
I was very rude

19:18.896 --> 19:20.507
when we attempted
to make that, um...

19:20.550 --> 19:22.335
:
...you know, that sex tape.

19:22.378 --> 19:25.207
:
Um, but, my little brother
is so talented

19:25.251 --> 19:26.643
and it would mean
the world to me

19:26.687 --> 19:28.645
if you could help him get
an audition, please.

19:29.951 --> 19:31.996
See you soon, Samantha.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.259
Bye, Ben.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.825
Your young lad
will be hard-pressed

19:34.869 --> 19:37.437
to beat young
Ben Blackthorne over there.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.486
Can you do the accent, son?

19:43.530 --> 19:45.967
:
Yes, sir, I believe I can.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.925
I believe I could do
a smashing job.

19:47.969 --> 19:51.277
Hmm.
Tucker.
That was excellent. Oh, my God.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.931
My word,
you are a talent, son.

19:53.975 --> 19:57.848
After all,
accents is acting.

19:57.892 --> 19:58.980
Hmm.

19:59.023 --> 20:01.287
Samantha,

20:01.330 --> 20:03.985
are you sure we can't fit in

20:04.028 --> 20:06.292
one more lil' urchin?

20:06.335 --> 20:08.729
For you, Colin?

20:08.772 --> 20:10.513
Get in there, kid.

20:10.557 --> 20:13.037
Off you go.Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you.

20:13.081 --> 20:15.214
Break a leg.
Break a leg.
Okay.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.563
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.042
Thank you.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.567
Oh, I can't listen.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.482
I got to pace, I got to pace.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.533
Oh, wow.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.753
I already signed in, so...

20:38.367 --> 20:41.936
Aha. Tucker Bunch.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.851
Little brother has big dreams.

20:43.894 --> 20:46.288
Wants to be Peter Pan... got it.

20:46.332 --> 20:48.159

20:49.422 --> 20:50.858

Oh, I've heard enough.
Thank you.

23:41.768 --> 23:43.987
They wouldn't let me finish.

23:44.031 --> 23:45.467
What?I don't know why.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.426
Well, did you ask
if you could just sing again?

23:47.469 --> 23:49.036
I asked.
I asked if I could try again,

23:49.079 --> 23:50.429
and they said, "Thank you."

23:50.472 --> 23:53.344
And we know what that means.
That means "Screw you."

23:54.345 --> 23:56.609
Miss, I'm so sorry

23:56.652 --> 23:58.393
to bother you, but my
little brother did not

23:58.437 --> 24:00.656
get a fair shot in there.
I mean, he's so talented.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.267
Can you please ask the director
if he can just sing again?

24:03.311 --> 24:04.399
I amthe director.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.661
Oh, right. It's the theater.

24:05.705 --> 24:06.880
You have female directors.

24:06.923 --> 24:09.404
Auditions are over! Thank you.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.101
[crowd chatter,
child groans]

24:11.145 --> 24:13.060
Don't "thank you" me.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.497
You can go "thank you" yourself.

24:21.634 --> 24:25.072
I ruined it.
I ruin everything. I...

24:25.115 --> 24:26.856
Hey, hey, hey, stop that.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.118
Please don't
say that stuff.

24:28.162 --> 24:31.426
You are wonderful and special.

24:37.127 --> 24:38.868
Hey, Colin, over here.

24:38.912 --> 24:41.741
Rebecca, is that you?

24:41.784 --> 24:43.873
Yes, I just saw you. We
had a full conversation.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.136
Listen, where did
the director go?

24:46.180 --> 24:47.660
Probably her hotel.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.183
It's right there.

24:49.226 --> 24:50.489
Okay. Thanks.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.709
Let's go. Come on.

24:56.712 --> 24:58.235
Okay, this seems a little crazy,
but no, no,

24:58.279 --> 25:00.934
I can justify this to myself,
because I love my brother.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.239
Huh

25:02.283 --> 25:04.807
Nothing. Shh. Okay, we're here.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.722
:
All right. Get ready.

25:08.376 --> 25:09.943
Room service.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.686
Oh, my God.No, no, no, no.
Just-just wait a second.

25:13.729 --> 25:16.297
Wait a second. Sing, Tucker.
Sing. Just start singing.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.298
What...?

25:22.129 --> 25:23.870
♪ In one indescribable
instant... ♪

25:23.913 --> 25:26.699
No. Stop. Stop. Stop.

25:26.742 --> 25:27.961
What is wrong with you?

25:28.004 --> 25:29.136
This is insane.

25:29.179 --> 25:30.398
You are a terrible mother.Huh?

25:30.441 --> 25:32.008
No. I'm not a mother.
You're wrong.

25:32.052 --> 25:33.444
I'm actually an older
half-sibling who's just trying

25:33.488 --> 25:35.098
to make up for lost time
to her younger half-sibling,

25:35.142 --> 25:37.187
which, to be fair,
I had some mental health issues.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.580
I have borderline
personality disorder,

25:38.624 --> 25:40.408
but I'm better now,
and just, he's so talented!

25:40.451 --> 25:42.192
I don't care
about your back story.

25:42.236 --> 25:44.586
Besides,
the part has already been cast.But...

25:44.630 --> 25:47.502
Ugh.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.417
I'm sorry, buddy.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.419
We tried.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.856
Let's go before
she calls the police.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.220
Oh, thank God.
Are you my masseur?

26:10.264 --> 26:11.831
Come on in. You won't
believe the day I've had.

26:11.874 --> 26:14.529
No, no. I-I'm here to tell you
you're making a big mistake.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.053
You need to cast
that delightful Tucker Bunch.

26:17.097 --> 26:19.055
What is it with people
and Tucker Bunch?

26:19.099 --> 26:21.057
The kid started his
audition with a speech

26:21.101 --> 26:22.624
about how he wants to
be a star at any cost.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.017
He is a troubled child actor,

26:24.060 --> 26:26.236
and he hasn't even
booked anything yet.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.151
Now go away. Thank you.

26:28.195 --> 26:29.936
Look, okay, I-I need this.

26:29.979 --> 26:32.025
Back story: my boss wants
to date Tucker's sister.

26:32.068 --> 26:35.594
You give Tucker the part, I take
credit for it with my boss,

26:35.637 --> 26:37.073
he takes credit for it
with Tucker's sister.

26:37.117 --> 26:38.422
It's a simple transaction,

26:38.466 --> 26:40.468
everyone wins!

26:43.297 --> 26:46.082
REBECCA:
Okay, let me just get
this bellhop shirt off.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.260
Hey, I got to pee.

26:50.304 --> 26:52.306
I'll be right back.

27:01.228 --> 27:02.664
PAULA:
So...

27:02.708 --> 27:05.058
who else have
you dated?

27:05.101 --> 27:08.757
What other themed festivals
have you guys gone to?

27:08.801 --> 27:10.454
Mom, can we just play the game?
I'm kind of into it now.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.848
We need to find the chalice.

27:12.892 --> 27:14.241
Okay.

27:14.284 --> 27:16.417
Ooh.

27:19.159 --> 27:20.900
These gems have letters on them.

27:20.943 --> 27:23.685
I think these need to be
arranged in some kind of order.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.121
Hey, well, here's an "N"

27:25.165 --> 27:27.950
and an "R," and
there's 12 holes.

27:27.994 --> 27:29.386
"Nestor Asgard" has 12 letters.

27:29.430 --> 27:30.997
Okay, just...Nestor. Okay.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.433
...tell me why I don't know

27:32.476 --> 27:34.478
about a major thing
in my son's life.

27:34.522 --> 27:36.306
Maybe because
all you ever ask us is whether

27:36.350 --> 27:38.178
our homework is done and whether
our underwear is clean.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.310
Yeah, so

27:40.354 --> 27:41.964
No, because I don't like
washing my underwear too much

27:42.008 --> 27:43.226
because of the environment.

27:43.270 --> 27:45.185
You think about the environment?
Since when?

27:45.228 --> 27:47.230
Since I became a vegetarian,
which is, of course,

27:47.274 --> 27:48.928
the best way
to reduce your carbon footprint.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.451
Oh, my God.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.496
I don't know anything
about my children. Nothing.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.194
Because we're not children
anymore, Mom.

27:54.237 --> 27:55.543
I'm a grown-ass man.

27:55.586 --> 27:56.762
And I'm a grown-ass boy.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.808
Nestor Asgard isn't working.

28:00.809 --> 28:02.202
Oh, don't look at me.

28:02.245 --> 28:04.378
I know nothing, apparently.

28:06.336 --> 28:09.122
What have you done
to get the Yamamoto case?

28:09.165 --> 28:11.254
I think
my work speaks for itself.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.910
Hmm.

28:14.954 --> 28:17.347
Okay, I-I-I...
I see what you did there.

28:17.391 --> 28:18.218
Uh, you worked

28:18.261 --> 28:20.133
hard, but I worked smart.

28:20.176 --> 28:23.092
I tried to get Rebecca's brother
the lead in Peter Pan...

28:23.136 --> 28:25.704
Sunil! How is that relevant?

28:25.747 --> 28:27.314
Thank you. Yes, exactly.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.708
Would you give us
a minute, Mrs. Hernandez?

28:32.319 --> 28:34.060
Hmm?

28:34.103 --> 28:36.279
I'm really sorry
for overstepping, sir,

28:36.323 --> 28:37.933
by interfering
in Rebecca's personal life.

28:37.977 --> 28:40.153
That would've been fine
if it had worked,

28:40.196 --> 28:42.111
but you got nowhere
with Rebecca?

28:42.155 --> 28:45.201
Technically, no, but I did
find out some more info.

28:45.245 --> 28:47.247
She has a brother,
and he's here.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.770
Already knew that. Get out.

28:48.814 --> 28:51.294
Okay, did you know that
she's desperate to please him?

28:51.338 --> 28:53.688
And he's obsessed with her.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.255
I saw him reading
her old diary.

28:55.298 --> 28:57.126
I mean, like, flipping
through it, studying it.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.867
I'm like, "Respect her privacy.
It says 'Keep out'."

28:58.911 --> 29:01.783
Oh, you are so dumb, Sunil.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.829
I need that diary.
Why?

29:03.872 --> 29:06.092
Because she says I don't
understand her, and you just

29:06.135 --> 29:08.311
told me there's a book
with all that info in there.

29:08.355 --> 29:10.531
Yeah, that's a great idea.

29:10.574 --> 29:13.142
:
Which is why I told it to you,

29:13.186 --> 29:15.405
and why you should give me
the Yamamoto case.

29:15.449 --> 29:17.930
Nice try.
Mrs. H, you got Yamamoto!

29:19.235 --> 29:20.454
Whatever. Whatever.

29:20.497 --> 29:22.630
Okay, that diary is
probably meaningless.

29:22.673 --> 29:25.067
She's a grown-ass lady.
I'm sure she's changed.

29:25.111 --> 29:28.810
Oh, my sweet, sweet,
simple, stupid Sunil.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.507
No, she hasn't changed, okay?

29:30.551 --> 29:34.033
I love Rebecca, but she's
basically a dramatic teenager.

29:36.209 --> 29:37.906
My life is over.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.778
What am I gonna do?

29:39.821 --> 29:41.083
My dreams are dead!

29:41.127 --> 29:44.434
Tucker, come on.

29:44.478 --> 29:46.349
No, they're not.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.438
I'm sorry I got you into
that whole auditioning thing,

29:48.482 --> 29:49.483
but it was a whim.

29:50.876 --> 29:53.356
Hey, come on. Let's
do something else.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.357
Let's go the beach!

29:54.401 --> 29:56.838
Huh? It's only
two hours away.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.971
We can go rollerblading
in the bike lane.

29:59.014 --> 30:00.320
I have rollerblades
I've never used.

30:00.363 --> 30:01.887
I-I got them when
I first moved here

30:01.930 --> 30:03.236
to impress this guy.
It's a whole thing.

30:03.279 --> 30:05.847
Rollerblading-- I don't know.

30:08.328 --> 30:11.679
Um, actually,
um, could I see them?

30:11.722 --> 30:13.594
I've only read about them.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.291
I've never seen
a pair in real life.Really?

30:15.335 --> 30:16.466
I'm gonna get them.

30:29.088 --> 30:31.090
I don't have much time.
What do you want?

30:36.356 --> 30:38.488
What are you doing here?

30:38.532 --> 30:39.881
Listen, little boy,
you took something

30:39.925 --> 30:42.492
that doesn't belong to you,
and now it's time

30:42.536 --> 30:45.931
for you to give the thing that
doesn't belong to you to me.

30:45.974 --> 30:47.541
What?

30:47.584 --> 30:49.238
The diary.
I want the diary.

30:49.282 --> 30:51.719
Look, I love your sister.

30:51.762 --> 30:54.200
I just think I need
to understand her better.

30:54.243 --> 30:56.376
I think that's what
she wants, too.

30:56.419 --> 30:59.683
It's very sweet, and you know
it willwork like a charm.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.903
I've been using it for days.

31:01.947 --> 31:04.166
How do you think I get
that puppet to dance?

31:05.994 --> 31:08.040
I give it to you,
what do I get?

31:10.390 --> 31:11.826
What do you want?

31:11.870 --> 31:15.003
I... want... Pan.

31:17.049 --> 31:19.007
Hmm.

31:19.051 --> 31:20.879
TOMMY:
Wait. No, no, no,
no, no, no. I...

31:20.922 --> 31:22.097
I got it. It's an anagram.

31:22.141 --> 31:23.664
Rearrange the letters
in "Nestor Asgard"

31:23.707 --> 31:25.057
to form "Dragon's Tears,"

31:25.100 --> 31:26.710
you know, the potion
that saves the kingdom.

31:26.754 --> 31:28.712
Okay. Uh-huh.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.978
Oh, my God, it worked!

31:33.021 --> 31:34.936
Tommy's smart.
Nothing makes sense anymore.

31:40.768 --> 31:43.249
Wow. I thought
you guys were just dead weight

31:43.292 --> 31:46.643
slowing down the minivan,
but I was wrong.

31:46.687 --> 31:48.341
Gee, big compliment, Mom.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.127
Oh.TRISTAN:
Hear ye, hear ye.

31:52.171 --> 31:53.520
You have completed
your noble quest.

31:53.563 --> 31:55.652
You have saved the kingdom.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.611
Prepare to be knighted

31:57.654 --> 32:01.223
and have your photo taken
over there for our website.Oh.

32:01.267 --> 32:03.878
Okay. Here. Take it,
take it, take it.Please tag us.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.314
Please Yelp us.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.925
Please kill me.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.622
Can you get closer?

32:08.665 --> 32:10.102
Come on, come on.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.059
Closer.

32:11.103 --> 32:12.843
Come here.
Oh.
Okay.

32:12.887 --> 32:14.671
You know what?

32:14.715 --> 32:16.369
I think we might be on our way.

32:16.412 --> 32:20.068
That's not what
he meant, Mom.

32:20.112 --> 32:21.635
REBECCA:
Oh, my God, that took forever.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.115
I have not sorted
through my closet in years.

32:23.158 --> 32:25.073
I found this old
Fett Regoso hoodie.

32:25.117 --> 32:26.988
It's practically
a collector's item.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.076
Tucker?

32:28.120 --> 32:29.643
Have you seen Tucker?

32:29.686 --> 32:32.167
Uh, no.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.865
Where were you?

32:34.909 --> 32:37.564
Oh, uh, I-I was just outside.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.000
Um...

32:39.044 --> 32:40.654
thinking about puberty.

32:40.697 --> 32:42.264
Yeah.
I still think about it, too.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.136
Oh!

32:44.179 --> 32:46.529
Oh, thank God.

32:47.574 --> 32:49.532
Hello?

32:49.576 --> 32:51.230
Yeah, this is Rebecca Bunch.

32:51.273 --> 32:53.972
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

32:55.277 --> 32:57.236
Are you thanking with me
right now?

32:57.279 --> 32:59.455
Wow.

32:59.499 --> 33:00.543
What

33:00.587 --> 33:01.762
That was Angela, the director.

33:01.805 --> 33:03.938
She said she had
a change of heart, and...

33:03.982 --> 33:05.896
you're Peter now.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.376
What? Oh, my gosh.

33:07.420 --> 33:08.943
:
What a whirlwind.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.641
You got the part!
This is unbelievable.

33:11.685 --> 33:13.687
We have to celebrate.

33:13.730 --> 33:16.037
Should we go get
a funky treat for teens?

33:16.081 --> 33:19.084
Yeah! Yeah,
let's go get a Rebetzel.

33:20.694 --> 33:22.652
Huh.

33:28.310 --> 33:31.357
Oh. Hey, Rebecca.
I didn't realize you were here.

33:31.400 --> 33:34.142
I-I'll give you your space,
so I'll go.

33:36.144 --> 33:38.016
Wait, um...

33:38.059 --> 33:41.280
I want to say something,
and then I'll leave you alone.

33:41.323 --> 33:43.238
I won't forgive myself
if I don't say it.

33:44.283 --> 33:46.111
Yeah.

33:48.722 --> 33:50.550
Go ahead.

33:50.593 --> 33:52.943
Rebecca, look, I know
I've made mistakes.

33:52.987 --> 33:54.597
Bad ones.

33:54.641 --> 33:57.078
And I realize I've been
going about this all wrong,

33:57.122 --> 34:00.342
but you have to know...

34:00.386 --> 34:03.345
you are the only thing
that makes me happy.

34:03.389 --> 34:04.694
When I'm not with you,

34:04.738 --> 34:06.914
my heart aches.

34:06.957 --> 34:09.264
I feel like I've lived
in a quiet forest my whole life,

34:09.308 --> 34:11.614
and then you showed up,
and the world starts to sing.

34:11.658 --> 34:15.183
I love you, plain and simple.

34:15.227 --> 34:19.579
You've awakened my heart
and unlocked my soul.

34:19.622 --> 34:21.450
Oh, my God, that is so sweet.

34:21.494 --> 34:23.626
That is so sweet.
What a great guy.

34:23.670 --> 34:24.932
Nathaniel...

34:24.975 --> 34:28.196
you memorized the ending speech

34:28.240 --> 34:29.806
from the movie Slumbered?

34:29.850 --> 34:31.243
Hmm?

34:31.286 --> 34:33.680
Yeah. Yes.

34:33.723 --> 34:35.203
That's-that's
exactly what I did.

34:35.247 --> 34:37.031
I-I know you love
that movie so much,

34:37.075 --> 34:39.903
so I watched it last night.

34:39.947 --> 34:41.688
You what?Yeah, I-I, uh...

34:41.731 --> 34:43.342
I streamed it.

34:44.386 --> 34:46.258
No, you did not.

34:46.301 --> 34:48.260
It's in the vault.

34:48.303 --> 34:50.305
You can't stream it.

34:50.349 --> 34:52.046
I mean, I should know.
I've written the company

34:52.090 --> 34:54.092
countless amounts of letters.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.487
How did you even know
I like that ending speech?

34:58.531 --> 35:00.141
I mean, I've thought about it.

35:00.185 --> 35:01.664
I fantasized about it.
I used to...

35:01.708 --> 35:05.538
think about the way my dream man
would say that to me.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.714
Well, that's it.
You've mentioned it.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.324
No. No. No, I didn't.

35:09.368 --> 35:11.370
I don't...
I don't tell people that.

35:11.413 --> 35:12.936
I've actually never told anyone
that because it's...

35:12.980 --> 35:14.808
it's silly and embarrassing.

35:14.851 --> 35:16.549
I mean, it's not even
a well-written speech.

35:16.592 --> 35:17.985
Well...
I mean,

35:18.028 --> 35:20.030
the only thing I ever told
was my diary.

35:20.074 --> 35:23.077
I used to write it
over and over in my diary.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.170
It was him. He stole it.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.172
He flew to New Mexico

35:31.216 --> 35:33.043
and stole your diary
from behind the toilet

35:33.087 --> 35:35.524
at Dad's house.Okay. He...

35:35.568 --> 35:37.831
What an invasion.

35:37.874 --> 35:39.398
Not surprising,
coming from someone

35:39.441 --> 35:42.357
that wears that offensively
titled Fett Regoso cologne.

35:42.401 --> 35:43.489
What, Nathaniel,

35:43.532 --> 35:45.186
you just thought
you could "Take Her"?

35:45.230 --> 35:48.407
Well, I'm taking her
away from you.Oh.

35:50.452 --> 35:52.411
Oh, you paid the director

35:52.454 --> 35:53.673
for him to get the part,
didn't you?

35:55.065 --> 35:57.329
Wow. How much did that
set you back?

35:57.372 --> 35:59.809
A lot. A lot.

35:59.853 --> 36:01.202
I-I thought that we were gonna
get back together.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.509
That's why I did it. I...Tucker? Hey.

36:03.552 --> 36:06.642
Wait in the back.
I'll deal with you in a second.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.171
You I'm gonna deal with now.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.003
Dude.I-I know.
I... It's bad.

36:20.047 --> 36:24.182
Okay, but what was
I supposed to do?

36:24.225 --> 36:25.922
I-I thought that we would
get back together,

36:25.966 --> 36:28.186
and we would look back on this
and laugh.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.491
You know what,
Nathaniel, I get it.

36:29.535 --> 36:31.189
You love me. Loud and clear.

36:31.232 --> 36:35.280
But the way you show your love
is so messed up.

36:35.323 --> 36:36.585
I mean, you just now

36:36.629 --> 36:37.630
tried to manipulate me,

36:37.673 --> 36:39.588
and you manipulated a child.

36:39.632 --> 36:41.329
Oh, if anyone
manipulated anyone,

36:41.373 --> 36:43.026
it was him who manipulated me.

36:43.070 --> 36:45.246
So you're-you're blaming
a 13

36:45.290 --> 36:46.813
No. It's inexcusable.

36:46.856 --> 36:48.467
You know what, I was wrong.

36:48.510 --> 36:51.078
It's not that you don't know
who I am.

36:51.121 --> 36:53.950
It's that we're not right
for each other,

36:53.994 --> 36:55.909
and we never will be.

36:55.952 --> 37:00.522
All we do when we're together
is scheme and cheat and lie.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.916
I am bad for you,
and you are bad for me.

37:02.959 --> 37:05.484
So you know what? We are done.

37:05.527 --> 37:06.833
We're not on a break,

37:06.876 --> 37:08.574
not thinking about it.
We're done.

37:10.924 --> 37:12.230
Please go.

37:21.935 --> 37:25.112
So, does your mom
even know you're here?

37:25.155 --> 37:28.158
No. She thinks I'm with Dad.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.291
And you just came here
for the audition?

37:30.335 --> 37:33.686
I-I really wanted
to get to know you, really.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.688
The audition
just happened to be here.

37:37.907 --> 37:40.867
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

37:40.910 --> 37:43.565
But Tucker, why did you lie?

37:43.609 --> 37:45.263
Why didn't you just tell me

37:45.306 --> 37:47.830
you wanted to come to L.A.
for an audition?

37:47.874 --> 37:49.832
I mean,
you could have trusted me.

37:49.876 --> 37:53.619
Trust you?
You've ignored me all my life.

37:53.662 --> 37:57.275
And no adult
has ever understood me. Ever.

37:57.318 --> 37:59.146
But you know how similar we are.

37:59.189 --> 38:01.148
Oh.

38:03.977 --> 38:05.674
So all those similarities
we had,

38:05.718 --> 38:07.981
those were just things you stole
from my diary?

38:08.024 --> 38:09.461
It started out that way.

38:09.504 --> 38:11.985
I was just saying all the things
you said in the diary.

38:12.028 --> 38:14.161
I never watched Slumbered,

38:14.204 --> 38:16.859
and I think milk with
sugar in it is gross.Mm.

38:16.903 --> 38:19.297
But we are the same.

38:19.340 --> 38:22.517
Just t-tell me
you'll forgive me.

38:22.561 --> 38:24.519
Oh, my God.

38:24.563 --> 38:28.958
I'm a horrible,
stupid, dumb, ugly,

38:29.002 --> 38:31.396
fat, stupid...Tucker, you don't have
to keep quoting my diary.

38:31.439 --> 38:33.006
What?

38:33.049 --> 38:35.225
That's not in the diary.
That's just how I feel.

38:35.269 --> 38:36.966
All the time.

38:37.010 --> 38:38.664
Really?

38:38.707 --> 38:40.361
Yes.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.624
That's finally the truth.

38:44.670 --> 38:47.368
Yeah, Tucker,
I need your mom's number.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.327
The real one this time.

38:53.722 --> 38:55.898
She hates me now.

38:55.942 --> 38:59.337
Nah, no. I don't think she does.

39:09.129 --> 39:12.262
So, I talked to your mom.

39:12.306 --> 39:15.527
Uh, and she was upset.

39:15.570 --> 39:17.355
But glad you're safe.

39:17.398 --> 39:20.270
And then we talked
about some other stuff,

39:20.314 --> 39:23.535
and she agreed
that when you get home,

39:23.578 --> 39:25.537
she's gonna find you
a good therapist.

39:27.147 --> 39:29.279
That's what I needed
when I was your age.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.412
You think I need therapy?

39:31.456 --> 39:33.762
Oh, no, I know you need therapy.

39:33.806 --> 39:35.895
And then I called Dad.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.853
Oh, no.

39:37.897 --> 39:39.812
And this summer,

39:39.855 --> 39:41.422
he's sending you
to theater camp.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.337
What?

39:43.381 --> 39:45.426
Wait, really?

39:45.470 --> 39:46.993
He'd never do that.

39:47.036 --> 39:49.169
I talked him into it.

39:49.212 --> 39:51.432
Also, I'm paying
for the theater camp,

39:51.476 --> 39:53.434
and I'm also paying
to replace you

39:53.478 --> 39:55.001
at the construction site
this summer,

39:55.044 --> 39:58.831
'cause he is...
literally the worst person.

39:58.874 --> 40:00.572
Neither here nor there.
Anyway, Tucker,

40:00.615 --> 40:03.096
but...

40:03.139 --> 40:05.446
you can't do Peter Pan.

40:05.490 --> 40:08.188
It's just not right, you know?

40:08.231 --> 40:09.885
You lied and schemed to get it.

40:09.929 --> 40:11.365
You didn't earn it.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.933
But that's how
show business works, right?

40:13.976 --> 40:17.632
That is true. Yes. But...

40:17.676 --> 40:20.069
it's just no way
to live your life.

40:21.462 --> 40:23.377
So, uh, you're gonna
go home soon.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.553
Okay.

40:25.597 --> 40:27.773
So do you hate me now?

40:27.816 --> 40:30.036
No. Hey, no.

40:30.079 --> 40:31.472
I love you.

40:31.516 --> 40:34.170
I love you, too.

40:34.214 --> 40:36.042
Jinx.
Jinx.

40:36.085 --> 40:37.522
But before you go home,

40:37.565 --> 40:39.437
there is something
we need to do.

40:39.480 --> 40:40.612
Okay.

40:43.353 --> 40:46.356
I kept a VCR
just for this movie.

40:48.358 --> 40:51.797
All right, so, I
recorded it from TV,

40:51.840 --> 40:54.408
so there are some commercials.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.018
Take Her.

40:56.062 --> 40:58.499
Take Her, by Fett Regoso.

40:58.543 --> 41:00.153
Here we go.

41:00.196 --> 41:02.242
Ooh.

41:09.554 --> 41:11.643
Does the animation get better?

41:11.686 --> 41:13.688
Oh, no.

41:22.567 --> 41:23.524
♪

41:23.568 --> 41:25.352
VOICES:
Take her.

41:25.395 --> 41:29.530
FETT REGOSO:
When you see what you want,
take her.

41:29.574 --> 41:30.966
Take her. Take her.

41:31.010 --> 41:32.402
Take her. Take her.

41:32.446 --> 41:33.360
No matter what she says,

41:33.403 --> 41:36.189
turn that no into a yes.

41:36.232 --> 41:39.192
Take... No, sorry.
Cut, cut, cut.

41:39.235 --> 41:40.541
MAN:
Cut. Take five.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.108
Guys, I'm not sure about this.

41:42.151 --> 41:44.153
Something doesn't feel right.

41:44.197 --> 41:45.981
You're right.
You're right, it's all wrong.

41:46.025 --> 41:47.896
The women should be naked.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.550
The men need bigger boots.

41:49.594 --> 41:52.248
No, I just don't think
this is gonna age well.

41:52.292 --> 41:53.554
No offense.

41:53.598 --> 41:55.251
This is kind of why I wanted
a female director.

41:55.295 --> 41:57.558
:
In television?

41:57.602 --> 41:58.733
I love this guy.

41:58.777 --> 42:01.519
I love it.
Let's take it from the top!
