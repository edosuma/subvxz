[man on radio]
<i>Maybe you should stay in bed, Arcadia.</i>

00:47.005 --> 00:49.049
<i>Looks like this storm may</i>
<i>stick with us for a while.</i>

00:49.132 --> 00:50.384
<i>If you're looking to stay dry,</i>

00:50.467 --> 00:54.054
<i>the local high school is performing</i>
Romeo and Juliet <i>tonight.</i>

00:54.137 --> 00:57.558
[Blinky] <i>Master Jim,</i>
<i>you must listen to me very carefully.</i>

00:57.641 --> 01:01.520
<i>They've captured me and want you</i>
<i>to come to the Bridge... alone.</i>

01:01.603 --> 01:03.981
<i>-Don't come! It's a trap!</i>
-[Strickler] <i>Give me that!</i>

01:04.230 --> 01:06.900
<i>It appears things have</i>
<i>grown awkward, Mr. Lake.</i>

01:06.984 --> 01:11.196
<i>Meet me in the alley beside the theater</i>
<i>if you ever want to see your friend again.</i>

01:11.280 --> 01:12.739
[Blinky]
<i>Don't open the Bridge!</i>

01:12.823 --> 01:14.491
<i>-Under no circumstan--</i>
-[line cuts off]

01:14.575 --> 01:19.329
I've listened to it a hundred times now,
and I still don't know what to do.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.541
You don't have to do this alone.
You've got Aaarrrgghh, Draal, me.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.961
They said I had to be alone. If I'm not,
what do you think they'll do to Blinky?

01:26.044 --> 01:28.922
Blinky made it clear.
"Under no circumstances."

01:29.006 --> 01:31.675
Enough friends have gotten hurt
because of me. No more.

01:31.758 --> 01:35.053
Well, it's your call.
You're the Trollhunter. Here.

01:35.137 --> 01:37.848
I picked it up in the woods
after they dragged you away.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.684
I thought since we found it together,
we'd always be in this together.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.853
Hello, Toby.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.106
Hey, Dr. Lake.
I was just leaving. He's all yours.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.192
Can you believe it? Coyotes!

01:50.402 --> 01:53.780
You have good friends.
One even stayed by your side all night.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.074
[chuckles]
Yeah, there's really no one like Toby.

01:56.158 --> 01:59.494
Actually, it was a girl.
She said her name was Claire.

01:59.578 --> 02:00.829
Huh...

02:01.788 --> 02:04.916
I want you to talk to me
and I expect to hear the truth.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.418
What were you doing in the woods?

02:07.169 --> 02:12.341
Well, Claire thought she heard her brother
crying in the woods, so we went in,

02:12.424 --> 02:15.761
but it was this pack
of crazy coyotes and--

02:15.844 --> 02:19.264
The truth, Jim.
Those scratches weren't from coyotes.

02:19.348 --> 02:23.477
-I swear! You can ask Claire.
-Stop lying to me!

02:23.560 --> 02:25.395
You come home from school
covered in bruises,

02:25.479 --> 02:29.107
sneak out in the middle of the night,
get arrested for a silly Chubby Tracker?

02:29.191 --> 02:31.443
-I know you're angry, but--
-[sighs]

02:31.526 --> 02:37.240
Angry? I'm not angry
and I'm long past worried. I'm terrified!

02:37.324 --> 02:39.743
You're young
and you think you're invincible,

02:39.826 --> 02:41.787
but one of these days, you're gonna...

02:41.870 --> 02:43.538
[sighs]

02:43.622 --> 02:45.749
find out you're not.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.292
We all do.

02:47.376 --> 02:50.087
Please, tell me
what is happening to my son.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.093
I found this in a cookbook.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.678
It's... still sealed.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.640
Whatever is happening,
whatever it is you're afraid to say,

03:01.723 --> 03:05.102
I want you to tell me, face to face.

03:06.895 --> 03:10.524
Believe it or not, there was a time when
you used to share everything with me.

03:16.405 --> 03:17.447
-Fine.
-Mom...

03:18.240 --> 03:21.952
If that's the way you feel,
your doctor has discharged you, Mr. Lake.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.620
Good luck at the play.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.250
Mom, I'm sorry.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.586
[Draal] I don't understand.
Why do you need to go it alone?

03:31.670 --> 03:37.092
Because this is the only way it will work.
You have to trust me on this, Draal.

03:37.175 --> 03:40.429
I trust you, but I also fear for you.

03:40.512 --> 03:44.641
You are walking into a den of death.
For what? Blinky?

03:44.725 --> 03:46.184
I'd do the same for you.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.814
Now, do you remember

03:50.897 --> 03:53.900
what you're gonna tell Toby and Aaarrrgghh
when they start to wonder where I am?

03:53.984 --> 03:56.403
-[growling]
-Aha! Here it is!

04:00.115 --> 04:01.116
Uh...

04:01.199 --> 04:04.536
If anything goes wrong,
if it means anything,

04:04.619 --> 04:06.997
I hope you're the next Trollhunter.

04:08.123 --> 04:11.334
And I hope it won't come to that.

04:20.469 --> 04:23.555
[ringtone playing]

04:23.638 --> 04:26.183
-Hey, Claire!
-Jim, we have a big problem.

04:26.266 --> 04:30.145
[knocking] Claire, is Jim in there?
We go on in an hour.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.690
One second! I get that I need
to act normal and everything,

04:33.774 --> 04:38.612
because, hey, now trolls exist,
but I can't play Juliet without Romeo.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.114
Remember when I said
that some of my friends are trolls?

04:41.198 --> 04:42.657
Is everything okay?

04:42.741 --> 04:47.078
Buy me some time?
I-I promise I will be there for call time.

04:47.162 --> 04:49.164
[Janeth knocking]
Claire, are you in there?

04:49.247 --> 04:51.374
One second! Okay, I'll do what I can.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.961
<i>And, Claire, thanks</i>
<i>for saving my life in the woods.</i>

04:55.045 --> 04:57.297
You find my brother
and we'll call it even.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.805
Drama queen?
You're the drama queen, mister!

05:04.888 --> 05:08.433
Claire-bear, come on!
Let's keep it crispy.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.435
Say "crispy" one more time!

05:10.519 --> 05:14.356
Oh! Save that fire for the stage, you two!

05:20.237 --> 05:22.072
So, you did come alone.

05:23.073 --> 05:27.285
This just might be the first time you've
followed my instructions to the letter.

05:27.369 --> 05:30.330
-You're learning.
-Where is Blinky?

05:35.210 --> 05:38.380
-Is it the real one?
-Ching-ching.

05:39.130 --> 05:43.969
It looks like all is in order.
Follow me. This will be over soon.

05:45.220 --> 05:49.099
The museum?
The Bridge was here the entire time?

05:49.182 --> 05:52.852
After we moved it, we knew it would be
the very last place you'd look.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.566
Just between you and me,
when Gunmar rules the surface,

05:57.649 --> 06:00.151
I'll do my best to look after your mother.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.611
So kind of you.

06:04.030 --> 06:08.868
He won't come, Bular.
Jim is a trained and true Trollhunter.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.792
Oh, Master Jim,
why did you not heed my warning?

06:15.875 --> 06:18.837
You promised we'd build
that Vespa together. Remember?

06:18.920 --> 06:24.467
-Now, cut him down. I brought the amulet.
-Open the Bridge. I will not ask again.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.261
[grunts]

06:26.344 --> 06:31.182
-Sorry, kid. It's business.
-No, Master Jim, don't do this!

06:31.266 --> 06:35.645
If you release Gunmar and his Gumm-Gumm
army, you will be unleashing darkness!

06:35.729 --> 06:38.064
The world will not survive Gunmar's reign!

06:38.148 --> 06:41.610
One troll's life is hardly worth
putting everyone at risk!

06:42.652 --> 06:46.698
Think about Trollmarket!
Your friends! Your own mother!

06:46.781 --> 06:49.409
-I trained you better than this!
-[laughing]

06:49.492 --> 06:52.996
[Blinky]
For the glory of Merlin, not another step!

06:53.079 --> 06:54.873
[electronic beeping]

06:54.956 --> 06:59.294
He's wearing a tracking device.
You said the Trollhunter was alone.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.881
Not Trollhunter. Trollhunters!

07:04.215 --> 07:08.470
I am Toby! Grandson of Nana!
Fan of hard rock!

07:08.553 --> 07:12.223
[soft jazz music playing]

07:12.307 --> 07:13.975
-Sorry. Wrong playlist.
-[music stops]

07:14.059 --> 07:18.813
-Hold on one second. Oh, okay, here it is!
-[rock music playing]

07:18.897 --> 07:20.815
For the glory of Merlin,
daylight is mine to command!

Kill them all!

07:39.334 --> 07:42.837

07:51.638 --> 07:55.475
-[growling]
-Ha-ha! You led the others right to us!

07:56.142 --> 08:01.231
Of course! Strauser's move
from <i>A Brief Recapitulation: Volume 43.</i>

08:01.314 --> 08:05.360
-I never doubted you for a moment!
-Tobes! Help Blinky!

08:05.443 --> 08:07.529
-Hang on, Jim!

Not again!

09:10.967 --> 09:15.472

What is taking so long, Tobias?
Are you using the sharp side?

Oh, shoot. Okay, there we go.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.135
Jim!

14:13.811 --> 14:16.272
[grunting, yelling]

14:16.355 --> 14:19.025
[panting, grunting]

14:20.193 --> 14:21.277
[coughing]

14:21.361 --> 14:22.695
-[laughing]
-[gasps]

14:22.779 --> 14:25.823
Yet another Trollhunter killed
under the same bridge.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.784
For the glory of Merlin,
daylight is mine to command!

14:27.867 --> 14:29.577
-[roars]
-[grunts]

14:29.660 --> 14:31.037
[panting]

14:32.622 --> 14:35.792
No more running, boy.
Daylight is fading.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.543
You sure about that?

14:41.381 --> 14:42.423
[roars]

14:42.507 --> 14:44.342
[yelling]

14:44.425 --> 14:46.386
-[grunting]
-[roaring]

14:50.848 --> 14:52.058
[shouts]

14:54.727 --> 14:56.604
[roaring, grunting]

14:59.899 --> 15:01.567
[screams, yells]

15:01.651 --> 15:04.946
-[panting]
-[grunting]

15:05.029 --> 15:07.824
You want to know
where the baby is? Don't you?

15:07.907 --> 15:09.951
[sighs]

15:10.034 --> 15:12.537
I can give him back to you.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.914
-[grunting]
-[roars]

15:14.997 --> 15:17.792
You kill me and the amulet
will never open the Bridge.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.711
There will always be other Trollhunters.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.006
[screams]

15:24.090 --> 15:29.720
You want to see Dad. I get it, trust me.
But we don't always get what we want.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.514
-[yelling]
-[grunting]

15:31.597 --> 15:33.850
-[roars]
-[screams]

15:34.517 --> 15:36.853
[grunting]

15:36.936 --> 15:41.399
Shame. I'd hoped your death would be
more entertaining than Kanjigar's.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.276
[grunting]

15:45.236 --> 15:46.404
[grunting]

15:46.487 --> 15:49.073
The amulet should never
have chosen a human.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.700
[groaning, screaming]

15:50.783 --> 15:53.327
You're too soft. Easy to kill.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.246
[screaming]

15:55.997 --> 15:58.040
-[laughing]
-[groaning]

15:58.124 --> 16:00.751
-Jim! Oh, no!
-[continues laughing]

16:00.835 --> 16:04.005
Just in time to see
their Trollhunter slain.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.716
But I'm not a troll.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.009
[yelling]

16:09.469 --> 16:10.636
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

16:10.720 --> 16:13.890
-[yelling]
-[groans]

16:13.973 --> 16:18.728
[screaming]

16:18.811 --> 16:22.273
-[groans]
-Now, that's daylight for you!

16:22.356 --> 16:25.818
[screaming]

16:37.497 --> 16:40.082
[takes deep breath]

16:42.251 --> 16:44.253
[groaning]

16:56.057 --> 17:01.979
-[laughing] You're alive!
-[chuckling] Master Jim!

17:02.063 --> 17:04.440
-Fleshbag!
-Jim!

17:04.523 --> 17:08.444
You've done it!
I... I can't find the words.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.656
-Dude! Victory hugging!
-Happy.

17:11.739 --> 17:15.159
[groans] Guys, I was almost
squeezed to death. Ease up a little.

17:15.242 --> 17:19.372
I can't believe it. You killed Bular,
the son of Gunmar, man!

17:19.454 --> 17:21.123
[takes deep breath]

17:21.207 --> 17:24.669
My father has been avenged.
Thank you, Trollhunter.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.173
And with minutes before your play starts!

17:29.257 --> 17:33.302
-[gasps] Oh, no, the play!
-The play! I almost forgot!

17:33.386 --> 17:35.471
Hurry, Master Jim!
Leave Killahead to us.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.722
-We'll take care of...
-[growling]

17:37.890 --> 17:39.225
[screaming]

17:39.308 --> 17:40.393
[roars]

17:40.476 --> 17:41.894
-[whimpering]
-[roars]

17:41.978 --> 17:44.438
[growls, roars]

17:47.942 --> 17:50.361
[breathing heavily]

17:50.444 --> 17:56.242
-Aaarrrgghh, your oath...
-Your life more important.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.912
Not pet. Wingman.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.083
Ditto, buddy.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.924
Now, let's go take care of that bridge
and make sure it never opens again.

18:12.008 --> 18:15.094
And, you, Master Jim...
the play must go on.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.180
-[coughing]
-[whispering]

18:22.852 --> 18:25.354
I will kiss thy lips.

18:35.323 --> 18:39.035
Thy lips are warm! Then, I'll be brief.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.580
O happy dagger! This is thy sheath.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.707
-[groans]
-[people gasp]

18:44.790 --> 18:47.960
[sighs]
There rust...

18:48.044 --> 18:50.963
[exhales] and let me die.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.965
[groans, sighs]

18:53.049 --> 18:55.551
[gasps]
Oh, Claire...

18:55.635 --> 18:59.430
-[sniffling]
-[coos]

18:59.513 --> 19:01.265
[gasps]
Are you...?

19:01.349 --> 19:05.269
[groans]
Juliet dies in this? No!

19:05.353 --> 19:07.313
[sobbing]

19:11.192 --> 19:14.487
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.

19:14.570 --> 19:18.866
Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.

19:18.949 --> 19:25.623
For never was a story of more woe
than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

19:25.706 --> 19:29.752
[cheers and applause]

19:29.835 --> 19:33.798
-We survived the play.
-Did we? I thought we just died.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.175
You actually showed up.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.011
Well, you know,
I try to keep my promises.

19:39.095 --> 19:43.182
And, Claire, I promise
I'm gonna find your brother,

19:43.265 --> 19:46.769
even if it means crossing
into the Darklands myself.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.857
Remember to bow.

19:58.197 --> 20:02.493
You mean we are gonna
find him... together.

20:02.576 --> 20:03.786
Remember to smile!

20:08.207 --> 20:09.750
[man on radio]
<i>Good morning, Arcadia!</i>

20:09.834 --> 20:12.837
<i>Well, looks like everyone survived</i>
<i>that torrential downpour.</i>

20:12.920 --> 20:16.590
<i>Seems like last night's flash flood</i>
<i>did some damage on the west...</i>

20:16.674 --> 20:21.053
All hail Jim, the Bular Slayer!

20:21.137 --> 20:24.598
-[all cheering]
-Hip hip hooray!

20:27.268 --> 20:31.147
Hey! Who wants tacos? Who wants tacos?
Taco for you. Taco for you.

20:31.230 --> 20:35.526
-Tacos for everybody!
-Mm! This tastes better than socks!

20:35.609 --> 20:39.321
-We love you, Jim!
-You're my favorite fleshbag!

20:39.405 --> 20:43.784
Don't let it go to your head, Master Jim.
You still have training to do.

20:43.868 --> 20:47.747
Hero's forge is unforgiving
to those who are not afraid.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.166
-And don't forget midterms.
-[chuckling]

20:50.249 --> 20:54.295
Lighten up, Blinkous. Why do you
always have to be such a grump?

20:54.378 --> 20:58.174
We have the Bridge.
Trollmarket is safe once again.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.718
But his teacher changeling
is still at large.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.053
-I trust our Trollhunter can handle it.
-Hi.

21:03.137 --> 21:06.390
Oh-ho! He has an excellent trainer.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.642
[Jim laughing]

21:08.726 --> 21:10.060
Mm...

21:10.144 --> 21:13.063
Well, you said you wanted adventure
and something more.

21:13.147 --> 21:16.317
-Did that amulet help you find it?
-Hmm...

21:16.400 --> 21:18.152
-No.
-[coughs] No?

21:18.819 --> 21:19.862
You did.

21:19.945 --> 21:23.783
[coughs, laughs]
I knew you needed me.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.827
I'm going to need you now
more than ever, Tobes.

21:26.911 --> 21:30.498
I don't know how, but we are gonna
get Claire's brother back.

21:30.581 --> 21:33.250
That place is huge, Jim!
Enrique could be anywhere!

21:33.334 --> 21:35.628
I wouldn't even know
where to start looking.

21:35.711 --> 21:40.549
-Then, there's Gunmar, of course.
-We'll figure it out. We always do.

21:46.889 --> 21:50.726
[grunting, chattering]

21:50.810 --> 21:54.063
Hmm?
[grunting]

22:00.486 --> 22:02.321
Huh?
[gasps]

22:04.114 --> 22:08.035
-[laughing]
-[babies cooing]

22:08.118 --> 22:11.622
[laughing continues]
