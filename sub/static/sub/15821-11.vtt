00:01.470 --> 00:03.760
no,I'm still 20 minutes out.

00:03.780 --> 00:05.890
That line was ridiculous.

00:06.689 --> 00:08.860
The lapd did not give me a badge

00:08.890 --> 00:12.150
so I could cut to the front of the line,lieutenant flynn.

00:17.300 --> 00:19.550
No. Just tell me where to go.

00:19.560 --> 00:22.000
You can brief me when I get there.

00:22.150 --> 00:23.310
Ok?

00:23.310 --> 00:25.760
I take vermont to the 10.

00:25.780 --> 00:27.530
Oh,shoot!

00:34.640 --> 00:37.300
Lieutenant flynn,let me call you right back.

01:28.770 --> 01:30.250
Son of a--

01:33.890 --> 01:34.790
what the hell were you thinking?

01:34.830 --> 01:36.150
Oh,I'm so sorry.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.130
I'm terribly sorry.

01:37.170 --> 01:38.690
I didn't see you.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.820
Well,it's nothing serious.

01:42.850 --> 01:44.710
Anyway,I'm gonna give you my business card,

01:44.750 --> 01:47.180
and it's got all my contact information.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.700
And I'm gonna write down my license number.

01:48.730 --> 01:50.720
You take your car to a good body shop.

01:50.750 --> 01:52.190
You really need to call the police.

01:52.210 --> 01:53.160
That won't be necessary.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.070
No,sweetie,it really is necessary.

01:55.100 --> 01:57.740
See,I work for the government,I can't just ignore the law.

01:57.770 --> 01:59.570
We need to get the police.

01:59.610 --> 02:01.110
You got 'em right here.

02:01.150 --> 02:04.540
Deputy chief brenda leigh johnson. Lapd.

02:05.110 --> 02:09.470
And as sorry as I am about that tiny,little dent on your suv,

02:09.500 --> 02:11.390
I've got a triple homicide to get to.

02:11.420 --> 02:13.140
Pardon me.

02:17.820 --> 02:20.630
Oh...shoot!

02:43.260 --> 02:44.350
What happened to your car?

02:44.380 --> 02:45.340
A little accident.

02:45.370 --> 02:47.630
This jerk...don't ask.

02:47.660 --> 02:49.320
Ok. Here you go.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.840
Thank you.

02:51.960 --> 02:56.050
Deputy chief johnson,detective sergeant david gabriel,priority homicide.

02:56.270 --> 02:58.010
So,what's our story here?

02:58.040 --> 03:02.420
Well,one of the neighbors called in a complaint about loud music coming from the house.

03:02.560 --> 03:06.630
Approximately 9:30am,units respond,no one answers,

03:06.660 --> 03:08.770
so one of the officers goes around the side of the house,

03:08.800 --> 03:11.400
noticed the window was broken and a trail of blood.

03:11.430 --> 03:13.010
Called in for backup.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.200
Well,let's have a look see.

03:21.140 --> 03:23.420
There's the stereo...

03:26.290 --> 03:28.080
empty house.

03:28.180 --> 03:30.350
Bunch of mattresses on the floor.

03:30.370 --> 03:32.270
Smells like dope.

03:32.390 --> 03:34.150
Except it doesn'T...

03:37.330 --> 03:40.970
Smell like dope or garbage or urine.

03:40.990 --> 03:43.950
This place is too clean to be a shooting gallery.

03:44.170 --> 03:47.650
If any of the neighbors know anything about who lives here or what they do,

03:47.670 --> 03:49.110
nobody is saying so.

03:49.140 --> 03:51.980
Well,we'll just have to figure it out for ourselves.

03:52.120 --> 03:56.470
Detective daniels,I want to know about everyone who owns,rents,or walks a dog by this house.

03:56.490 --> 03:57.210
Already on it.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.410
Thank you.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.520
Sergeant gabriel,where are the bodies?

04:00.560 --> 04:02.600
There are no bodies.

04:03.570 --> 04:04.940
Excuse me?

04:04.990 --> 04:08.010
Responding officer could see a blood trail from the side window,

04:08.030 --> 04:10.800
but when we got inside,no bodies.

04:10.830 --> 04:14.210
Commander taylor,I was told to rush to the scene of a triple homicide.

04:14.250 --> 04:19.970
Could you please tell me what you found that suggests this is either a priority or a homicide?

04:25.880 --> 04:30.990
I'd say this was something more than someone cutting his hand while chopping onions.

04:31.140 --> 04:34.820
We found significant brain matter in both those spills.

04:34.850 --> 04:37.430
Yeah,with a bunch of bullet fragments,too,

04:37.460 --> 04:40.880
and there's a slug over here in this wall.

04:45.060 --> 04:47.220
Where do those drag marks go?

04:48.280 --> 04:49.880
Out the side door here.

04:49.910 --> 04:55.330
I'm guessing that someone was waiting outside with a truck or a car to haul the bodies away.

04:57.390 --> 05:01.430
It's about 3,000 bucks of U.S. Dollars,pesos,even some food stamps.

05:01.460 --> 05:04.760
Now it's smelling a little more like dope.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.490
Chief.

05:06.850 --> 05:09.660
Here's victim number three.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.430
Doesn't look like there's much blood over there.

05:14.460 --> 05:15.280
What about brain matter?

05:15.300 --> 05:16.960
We haven't found any yet.

05:16.980 --> 05:22.270
From the looks of this blood trail,I'd say he or she left here alive.

05:23.880 --> 05:28.210
Ok,so...the shooter fires here,boom.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.320
And here,boom and then moves to hit someone who's running for their life,boom.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.110
Which would explain our wall slug.

05:34.140 --> 05:35.620
Boom.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.250
And our lonely casing,right there.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.070
Have we checked with the ers in the area?

05:43.100 --> 05:44.200
We put out a medical alert.

05:44.230 --> 05:45.440
Notified all of the hospitals.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.860
They'll let us know if any gunshot wounds show up.

05:47.900 --> 05:51.960
Excuse me,chief,I think we might want to let this out to the press.

05:51.990 --> 05:53.010
Why?

05:53.040 --> 05:56.520
Our guy didn't walk out of this bloodbath and stroll over to cedars sinai.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.370
A word from the press might shake the trees.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.590
Generate some tips.

06:02.210 --> 06:07.340
All right,well,let's tell them we're looking for an injured person who's either a witness or a victim.

06:07.370 --> 06:09.250
Don't give them any of the details,please.

06:09.270 --> 06:10.470
Yes,ma'am.
Thank you.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.020
Glad to help.

06:27.370 --> 06:30.480
Lieutenant flynn,I'm gonna need your phone.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.900
Really?

06:34.890 --> 06:37.950
All right,well,let me know as soon as you get that information.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.270
Thank you.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.660
So,the dna results will not be back for another 36 hours,

06:42.690 --> 06:47.160
but the preliminary blood work confirms that there were at least 3 people wounded in that house.

06:47.180 --> 06:52.010
So,lieutenant provenza,any hospital in the county report a patient that might be our missing victim?

06:52.040 --> 06:53.240
All of our victims are missing.

06:53.260 --> 06:55.180
No,I mean the victim that left the scene alive,

06:55.210 --> 06:57.430
not the two that left parts of their brains on the kitchen floor.

06:57.470 --> 07:00.320
Chief,I mean,there's been 6 or 7 maybe.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.660
Wait. I got it right here.

07:02.740 --> 07:06.260
We got 9 reported gunshots.

07:06.290 --> 07:08.250
That's in the past 6 hours.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.270
Two of them also reported cuts.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.090
One's at st. Joe's,one's at county.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.990
Now I've got two outstanding officers checking it out,

07:15.020 --> 07:16.900
and I'll tell them to call in,you know,

07:16.900 --> 07:18.050
if something looks promising.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.540
Well,thank you,lieutenant provenza,

07:19.570 --> 07:24.300
but I don't want outstanding officers checking things out,I want you.

07:24.680 --> 07:25.950
Thank you.

07:26.530 --> 07:27.930
Thank you.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.650
Detective daniels,who owns that house?

07:30.870 --> 07:31.920
A management company.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.280
Jacobsen properties.

07:33.300 --> 07:34.400
They lease it month to month,

07:34.430 --> 07:36.570
but they haven't had a tenant in over a year.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.600
I'm checking to see if any employees,maids,

07:38.620 --> 07:40.610
or handymen might have had a key to the house.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.200
Ok. Lieutenant tao,what can you tell--

07:47.010 --> 07:48.490
where's lieutenant tao?

07:48.510 --> 07:49.930
Oahu.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.900
O-what-hu?

07:52.290 --> 07:55.180
Oahu. Hawaii.

07:55.270 --> 07:56.350
Chief,tao's on vacation.

07:56.380 --> 07:57.670
He took his kids surfing.

07:57.690 --> 07:59.900
I'm actually handling the ballistics.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.040
All right,well,sergeant gabriel,what do you have?

08:02.040 --> 08:03.970
Well,the casings are medium caliber.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.620
.380,semiautomatic,they all appear to be fired from the same gun.

08:07.650 --> 08:11.670
I walked them down to ballistics about an hour ago.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.170
They're gonna run them through the nibin database and get back to us by this evening.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.080
This evening?

08:16.080 --> 08:18.120
Lieutenant tao gets me those results in an hour.

08:18.140 --> 08:21.950
Well,that's because lieutenant tao knows their secret handshake.

08:22.080 --> 08:27.890
Plus the fact he gives sheila down there a bottle of kahlua every friday.

08:29.350 --> 08:33.370
Sergeant gabriel,let's see if we can't get that information back a little quicker.

08:33.409 --> 08:34.179
Thank you.

08:34.220 --> 08:36.690
Detective sanchez,what can you tell me about the neighbors?

08:36.710 --> 08:39.309
Well,nobody admits seeing a car in front of that house.

08:39.320 --> 08:43.090
And I got a call into traffic to give me a report on any tickets over the past week,

08:43.120 --> 08:45.920
also any reports of abandoned or suspicious vehicles.

08:45.950 --> 08:48.520
Ok. With all that cash in the kitchen drawer,

08:48.550 --> 08:49.560
this might be drug related.

08:49.580 --> 08:51.800
I need someone to talk to narcotics.

08:51.910 --> 08:54.560
Without it turning into a street brawl.

08:55.170 --> 08:57.110
Given the number of homicides that are drug related,

08:57.140 --> 08:59.890
we are gonna have to smooth things over with them.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.690
Ok,lieutenant flynn.

09:01.730 --> 09:03.790
Flynn is gonna be our goodwill ambassador?

09:03.810 --> 09:05.310
What?

09:07.920 --> 09:10.720
Uh,see if there's any warrants that were served at that house,

09:10.740 --> 09:12.730
or if there have been any narcotics complaints.

09:12.750 --> 09:13.840
Thank you.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.660
Yes,sir.Can I help you?

09:15.690 --> 09:17.790
Captain west. Traffic.

09:17.820 --> 09:19.640
Oh,you want to talk to detective sanchez.

09:19.640 --> 09:20.580
He's right here.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.920
I'm not here to talk to detective sanchez.

09:22.950 --> 09:26.710
I'm here to talk to you about your accident.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.740
Oh. Ok.

09:31.430 --> 09:32.730
That's very funny.

09:33.090 --> 09:34.450
That's funny.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.620
You were--

09:35.620 --> 09:36.990
oh,you're kidding.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.700
I know you're kidding.

09:38.890 --> 09:40.220
That's funny.

09:40.260 --> 09:41.260
That's good.

09:41.290 --> 09:44.130
I like that. No?

09:44.590 --> 09:45.550
No?

09:45.580 --> 09:47.340
It's not...

09:48.110 --> 09:49.370
ok.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.820
my office,please,sir.

09:59.590 --> 10:01.560
Why don't you have a seat,sir.

10:02.940 --> 10:05.460
Now,how can I help you?

10:05.490 --> 10:12.520
I am here to investigate a charge that you were involved in a hit and run accident this morning.

10:12.590 --> 10:14.830
You mean that dust up at the coffee shop?

10:14.830 --> 10:15.980
Is that how you think of it?

10:15.980 --> 10:17.270
That's precisely how I think of it.

10:17.290 --> 10:19.330
I bumped into an suv.Barely.

10:19.350 --> 10:21.320
And then fled the scene.

10:21.350 --> 10:23.500
Why didn't you report the accident?

10:23.530 --> 10:25.080
I gave that guy all my information.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.940
My business card,and my license number.

10:26.970 --> 10:33.890
Leaving aside that what you say directly contradicts the account of mr. Carson,the man whose vehicle you hit,

10:33.920 --> 10:36.580
you still haven't answered my question.

10:36.580 --> 10:41.370
Why did you fail,despite very clear department policy,to report this accident?

10:41.390 --> 10:42.510
Didn't seem important.

10:42.510 --> 10:44.390
Were you drinking?

10:44.730 --> 10:47.710
I was getting coffee.

10:49.100 --> 10:52.830
You ever have anything stronger than that at breakfast?

10:53.080 --> 10:56.420
I was on my way to the scene of a triple homicide.

10:56.450 --> 10:59.020
I gave all the information to the person I hit.

10:59.020 --> 11:01.340
So,I didn't do anything wrong.

11:01.340 --> 11:06.080
Except expose the taxpayers and the city of los angeles to a possible lawsuit.

11:06.100 --> 11:10.280
That is why we have a strict code of conduct that states,

11:10.310 --> 11:14.560
any officer involved in a vehicular accident while on duty,

11:14.610 --> 11:18.140
must remain with their vehicle at the scene of said accident

11:18.160 --> 11:23.050
until a traffic officer completes a thorough investigation.

11:23.070 --> 11:25.180
There was a triple homicide.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.990
Did you hear that part?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.520
Dead human beings.

11:28.550 --> 11:31.890
Did you not know this is department policy?

11:33.840 --> 11:36.140
I wasn't aware. No.

11:36.200 --> 11:43.150
Well,maybe that's why the lapd usually promotes from within its own ranks rather than bringing deputy chiefs in from atlanta.

11:43.170 --> 11:48.640
Because every other cop in this building knows that when you get in any kind of accident--

11:48.670 --> 11:49.940
Hey,chief.We just got a tip.

11:49.950 --> 11:51.820
A guy walked into a clinic in east L.A.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.170
With a bullet in his leg.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.570
Sanchez is already on his way.

11:56.410 --> 11:57.380
Well,captain west,

11:57.410 --> 12:01.740
I can think of nothing I'd enjoy more than to sit here and listen to you read me the rule book for hours,

12:01.760 --> 12:04.280
but I have some actual police business to attend do.

12:04.310 --> 12:07.860
I will need these reports on my desk by tomorrow morning,

12:07.880 --> 12:10.870
and if you refuse to cooperate with my investigation,

12:10.890 --> 12:14.190
I will be forced to take this straight to chief pope.

12:15.550 --> 12:17.620
Be my guest.

12:31.950 --> 12:33.920
A nurse who works here at the clinic called the tip line.

12:33.950 --> 12:35.280
She got the number off the news.

12:35.300 --> 12:38.590
A man came in here this morning bleeding with a bullet in his leg.

12:38.630 --> 12:41.190
She's getting the doctor right now.

12:43.510 --> 12:44.550
How can I help you?

12:44.580 --> 12:46.590
Deputy chief brenda leigh johnson. Lapd.

12:46.610 --> 12:48.980
I need to speak with the injured gentleman.

12:49.050 --> 12:50.670
I was able to remove the bullet in his leg.

12:50.700 --> 12:53.000
He's recovering but rather traumatized.

12:53.020 --> 12:54.120
He lost quite a bit of blood.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.130
Why didn't you call this in?

12:58.320 --> 13:00.000
I've been sewing this guy's wounds for over an hour.

13:00.020 --> 13:01.640
I didn't have time to call the police yet.

13:01.660 --> 13:03.740
Well,I need to speak with him.

13:04.390 --> 13:05.530
Ok.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.060
Is he able to speak?

13:07.080 --> 13:08.840
I gave him a pretty healthy dose of percocet.

13:08.870 --> 13:10.720
He's a little loopy.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.610
Blood on the door.

13:14.820 --> 13:17.070
Hey,stop! Get down!

13:22.390 --> 13:23.370
Call an ambulance.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.460
We're taking this man over to county.

13:28.310 --> 13:31.180
Then we can figure out why he's in such a hurry.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.740
Hugo?

13:42.920 --> 13:44.180
Gracias.

13:44.210 --> 13:48.920
Detective sanchez,I need you to tell hugo that we brought him to a hospital to take better care of him.

13:48.950 --> 13:53.820
Lo cambiamos al hospital para darle mejor atencion medica.

13:54.260 --> 13:57.220
I know that this day has been difficult for you.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.660
Entendemos que ha tenido un dia dificil.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.460
But I need to ask you some questions,is that ok?

14:02.460 --> 14:06.680
Pero necesitamos hacerle algunas preguntas. Esta bien?

14:07.130 --> 14:10.090
You told the nurse at the clinic that you were shot by some gang members.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.350
That you were just walking by.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.260
But that is a big,fat lie.

14:15.300 --> 14:16.230
No,no,no.

14:16.250 --> 14:19.700
Es la verdad.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.040
I'm telling the truth.

14:22.630 --> 14:23.780
Want me to translate that,chief?

14:23.810 --> 14:25.130
No,I get the sense of it.

14:25.150 --> 14:26.680
Now that we're all speaking english,

14:26.680 --> 14:29.550
let's see if we can agree on the truth,ok?

14:29.700 --> 14:34.120
For example,you were shot at a house near the clinic where we picked you up.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.510
We found your blood there,so don't bother denying it.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.270
Please don't send me back.

14:39.300 --> 14:41.450
Please don'T.

14:42.140 --> 14:44.490
I can't go back.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.840
So you're illegal?

14:46.860 --> 14:48.350
Is that why you ran away?

14:48.390 --> 14:49.880
Si.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.870
I was scared.

14:51.950 --> 14:54.580
I did not know who you were.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.110
Well,now you do.

14:57.780 --> 14:59.660
If you're honest with me,

14:59.690 --> 15:02.920
I'll do everything I can to make sure you stay here.

15:02.940 --> 15:05.680
You tell me the truth now.

15:08.080 --> 15:11.870
I was smuggled over with 10 others.

15:12.240 --> 15:16.680
The coyotes led us through the sewage canals.

15:17.160 --> 15:20.700
We had to swim to the other side.

15:21.310 --> 15:24.620
I could barely see,it was so dark.

15:24.640 --> 15:29.730
When they got over the border,these smugglers,these "coyotes,"

15:29.750 --> 15:33.430
they loaded all 11 people into the back of a truck.

15:36.220 --> 15:37.930
When they got to the coyote's house,

15:37.950 --> 15:42.520
they jacked the rate another $500 before they'll let anyone go.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.350
Assholes.

15:44.390 --> 15:47.950
So everybody had to call their relatives to pay the higher price.

15:47.980 --> 15:51.580
One of the coyotes went to a specific drop-off point to pick up the ransom,

15:51.610 --> 15:53.350
then they'd release the immigrants.

15:53.370 --> 15:56.250
But hugo and two others with the money,

15:56.270 --> 15:59.240
so the coyote started screaming and pulled out a gun.

15:59.290 --> 16:01.100
That's when hugo ran towards the back door.

16:01.130 --> 16:03.790
He was a block away before he realized he'd been hit.

16:03.830 --> 16:06.490
Did hugo give a description of the coyote?

16:06.530 --> 16:07.790
Oh,let me guess.

16:07.820 --> 16:09.700
Mexican?

16:11.200 --> 16:16.030
What? If he's an illegal guide,he's not gonna be from canada.

16:16.070 --> 16:18.730
Hugo said the killer had a tattoo on his neck.

16:18.750 --> 16:20.390
Our lady of guadalupe.

16:20.390 --> 16:23.960
He also said that the truck that brought them to L.A. Was white.

16:23.980 --> 16:25.260
Why kill your cargo?

16:25.280 --> 16:26.620
It's bad for business.

16:26.650 --> 16:29.030
These coyotes,they've got lots of business.

16:29.030 --> 16:33.220
Hundreds of immigrants want to get across the border every day.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.580
How'd you get here,sanchez?

16:34.610 --> 16:35.770
Your daughter drove me.

16:37.220 --> 16:40.350
lieutenant provenza,our witness gave us a vehicle description.

16:40.370 --> 16:42.350
Check with impound.Maybe we'll get lucky.

16:42.380 --> 16:45.040
Thank you.
Thank you,senorita.

16:45.060 --> 16:46.960
Have a nice day.

16:46.980 --> 16:48.130
It's all right,it's all right.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.270
Sergeant gabriel,any luck with the gun?

16:50.290 --> 16:51.760
Yeah,nibin hit the jackpot.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.850
Our weapon was used in a previous shooting.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.090
Exact same gun.

16:55.250 --> 16:56.840
A .380 semiautomatic.

16:57.060 --> 16:59.790
I pulled the file.

16:59.880 --> 17:00.820
3 years ago,

17:00.830 --> 17:04.540
2 gang members exchanged a few rounds in lincoln heights.Aylesworth place.

17:04.579 --> 17:06.970
No one got hit,and both shooters ran off.

17:06.990 --> 17:10.030
But witnesses report seeing one of them toss a gun into the bushes.

17:10.060 --> 17:15.119
I'm guessing a ficus or potacarpus or some sort of ground leafy cover--

17:15.140 --> 17:17.130
sergeant gabriel,please,finish.

17:17.150 --> 17:19.470
Must be channeling tao from hawaii.

17:19.490 --> 17:21.109
Responding officers searched the area.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.970
They did not find a gun,but,

17:23.000 --> 17:26.329
the casings that they found match the casings from our crime scene.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.810
Ok,so we don't have a gun,

17:28.840 --> 17:30.620
but we know that it was used before in L.A.

17:30.650 --> 17:31.720
We don't have a truck,

17:31.740 --> 17:32.760
but we know that it was white,

17:32.810 --> 17:33.970
and we don't have any bodies,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.070
but we're pretty sure some people are dead.

17:36.090 --> 17:37.910
Anything else we don't have?

17:37.940 --> 17:39.700
We don't have any post-it notes.

17:39.740 --> 17:44.220
I used them all writing down captain traffic's messages for you.

17:46.750 --> 17:50.390
According to section 440 of the lapd manual,

17:50.410 --> 17:56.890
what must an officer do immediately when he or she is involved in an automobile accident while on duty?

17:56.910 --> 17:58.620
Do you know the answer?

17:58.650 --> 18:00.220
Will,it's a stupid question.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.200
It doesn't take into consideration any mitigating--

18:02.200 --> 18:03.840
do you know the answer?

18:03.860 --> 18:04.970
The question should be,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.980
what should a deputy chief do when involved in a fender bender,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.720
on her way to a triple homicide,

18:09.740 --> 18:11.700
to serve and protect the people of los angeles,

18:11.720 --> 18:14.850
after she tells the big faker,who she barely touched,

18:14.870 --> 18:17.530
that she'll take care of everything?

18:18.260 --> 18:20.890
Do you know the answer?

18:21.890 --> 18:23.030
Well,I do now.

18:23.060 --> 18:30.090
But will,how am i supposed to handle this case and deal with this captain west and the bug that's up his you know what?

18:30.130 --> 18:32.650
Please,will,can't you just make this go away?

18:32.680 --> 18:34.760
Brenda,you were wrong.

18:34.810 --> 18:38.250
You left the scene of an accident without following lapd protocol.

18:38.340 --> 18:41.430
No matter how right you think you are,them's the rules.

18:41.460 --> 18:43.330
Ok,so,make time.

18:43.350 --> 18:45.530
Like I did for your deposition?

18:47.370 --> 18:50.460
That was...a different situation entirely.

18:50.490 --> 18:54.050
Look,it can't look like I'm cutting you slack right after you did me a favor.

18:54.070 --> 18:57.870
That would jeopardize both of our standings in the department.

18:58.330 --> 19:02.100
The best thing you can do is just take your medicine,

19:02.130 --> 19:05.300
and we'll all feel better in the morning,ok?

19:06.710 --> 19:09.340
Oh,and,uh,I need your key.

19:09.460 --> 19:11.480
To your car.

19:11.550 --> 19:13.150
For the investigation.

19:15.230 --> 19:18.540
you're not serious.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.030
You think I like upsetting you?

19:34.140 --> 19:35.920
Yes.

19:45.610 --> 19:48.080
He works for the government,called me sweetie,

19:48.110 --> 19:49.910
and now he's saying he's got whiplash.

19:49.930 --> 19:51.640
It was a teeny,tiny dent.

19:51.660 --> 19:52.480
Well,you did hit him.

19:52.510 --> 19:54.540
Yeah,he was in my blind spot.

19:54.570 --> 19:55.710
Were you nice?

19:55.730 --> 19:57.300
I was very nice!

19:57.330 --> 19:58.050
Look...

19:58.060 --> 20:00.590
I don't want to talk about this anymore,ok?

20:00.600 --> 20:02.930
I just,I don't want to talk about it.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.920
I just want to have a nice,quiet dinner,just the two of us--

20:07.220 --> 20:09.170
Oh,can you just--

20:09.230 --> 20:10.740
I told you we ordered too much.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.670
It's middle eastern.You always over order.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.750
Oh,kitty. Oh,honey.

20:14.770 --> 20:16.260
Agent howard.

20:16.370 --> 20:17.410
You found the bodies.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.330
Great,detective sanchez.

20:19.350 --> 20:20.570
What bodies?
That's for me.

20:20.590 --> 20:21.300
I know.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.170
Hello. Hi,detective.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.340
Oh,good.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.680
You gave out my number?
I crushed my phone.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.490
How did you--
dead body. Dead body.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.250
All right,good.

20:29.270 --> 20:30.270
I'll meet you there.

20:30.290 --> 20:31.650
Ok,bye.

20:31.650 --> 20:32.720
I need to borrow your car.

20:32.750 --> 20:33.930
Uh,no.

20:34.020 --> 20:34.800
What?

20:34.820 --> 20:36.270
It's new.

20:36.940 --> 20:40.850
Your recent driving record hasn't been exactly spectacular.

20:41.310 --> 20:42.820
No.

21:12.380 --> 21:14.460
Does he ever smile?

21:14.490 --> 21:16.820
I mean,he found some bodies.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.260
Two hispanic males shot at close range,

21:20.280 --> 21:21.710
stashed in the back of the truck.

21:21.710 --> 21:23.920
Who found the truck?

21:25.240 --> 21:27.010
Traffic called it in.

21:27.030 --> 21:29.220
after they wrote a ticket on it.

21:29.300 --> 21:31.490
I'm surprised they found the time.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.180
Any weapons discovered?

21:33.180 --> 21:35.320
That's the one thing we haven't found.

21:35.320 --> 21:38.800
People think construction sites are just big trashcans.

21:38.820 --> 21:43.130
We found syringes,shotgun shells,a couple of candles,some condoms,

21:43.160 --> 21:45.210
and a powder blue toilet seat.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.030
Bag it all up,please.

21:47.060 --> 21:48.450
Thank you.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.010
Thank you.

21:51.220 --> 21:55.300
I'm guessing they've been dead 20,24 hours.

21:55.340 --> 22:00.530
The entry wounds are consistent with a medium caliber weapon like our missing .380.

22:12.110 --> 22:13.400
Uh,chief,we don'T...

22:14.900 --> 22:17.900
Let me see that.

22:19.460 --> 22:22.680
Detective,look what we have here.

22:22.710 --> 22:24.400
Our lady of guadalupe.

22:24.430 --> 22:28.320
Looks like one of our victims is also our killer.

22:30.990 --> 22:34.130
So who killed the killer?

22:51.630 --> 22:53.930
Dr. Crippen is on a leave of absence.

22:53.960 --> 23:00.830
Dr. Tan will be overseeing and reviewing the autopsy with assistant terrence hynes.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.370
Both men were shot in the face.

23:04.410 --> 23:06.490
Instant death.

23:07.050 --> 23:08.730
When?

23:08.840 --> 23:10.690
Chief johnson has asked the time of death,

23:10.900 --> 23:13.310
and I,dr. Tan,am responding.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.270
According to my investigator at the scene,

23:15.300 --> 23:18.360
both bodies had been dead for approximately 24 hours.

23:18.390 --> 23:23.560
Also,the brain matter found in the house is consistent with these head wounds.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.580
How certain are you of that?

23:26.610 --> 23:29.930
We won't know for sure until the full dna results come back.

23:30.070 --> 23:31.150
But if you had to guess,

23:31.180 --> 23:33.590
these are the guys who died at our original house party.

23:33.630 --> 23:35.200
I don't have to guess.

23:35.230 --> 23:37.460
There are drag marks on both juan does.

23:37.490 --> 23:39.980
Postmortem scrapes and scratches on their backs.

23:40.010 --> 23:42.290
May I show them what I found?

23:42.630 --> 23:48.780
I had a career intervention with myself some weeks back and decided to pursue the coronary arts,

23:48.830 --> 23:50.520
so I'm going to medical school part time,

23:50.540 --> 23:52.120
and I'm really enjoying--

23:52.140 --> 23:54.190
tell me what you found,terrence.

23:54.220 --> 24:00.760
Saliva. On,uh,both men on their faces,but it's not their own.

24:00.770 --> 24:04.870
Here,on the forehead,and a little bit there near the entry wound.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.830
Which more than likely means that--

24:06.860 --> 24:08.400
the killer spat in their faces.

24:08.420 --> 24:11.910
This doesn't seem like some coyote just losing his temper,

24:11.940 --> 24:14.040
it's more personal.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.500
I need to have samples of the saliva for d--

24:16.540 --> 24:18.420
for dna testing.

24:18.450 --> 24:21.220
Chief johnson has asked for saliva samples,

24:21.390 --> 24:25.580
and I,dr. Tan,have authorized my assistant,terrence hynes to provide these samples.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.780
Voila.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.720
Mademoiselle.

24:27.750 --> 24:29.160
Oh,thank you.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.740
Thank you.

24:33.440 --> 24:37.090
I'm confused,hugo said that two illegals got shot by the coyote,

24:37.120 --> 24:40.300
but now we have one dead illegal and one dead coyote.

24:40.330 --> 24:43.900
From what we know,the coyote is illegal as well,so technically...

24:43.960 --> 24:46.250
well,then...are we still...

24:46.280 --> 24:48.490
wait,are we still looking for another body,

24:48.530 --> 24:50.160
or a different killer?

24:50.190 --> 24:51.540
Yes.

24:52.300 --> 24:55.410
Why would you spit in someone's face?

24:56.910 --> 24:57.500
Hate.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.260
Or contempt.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.440
Contempt.

25:00.500 --> 25:04.160
Well,we know that the coyote was extorting extra money from these illegals.

25:04.210 --> 25:06.900
Maybe he wasn't kicking anything back to the boss.

25:06.930 --> 25:08.060
Boss got wind of it,

25:08.090 --> 25:11.910
didn't want people to think he was getting soft and ordered the hit to send a message to the other employees.

25:11.940 --> 25:14.640
Well,if that's the case,why not just kill the coyote?

25:14.680 --> 25:16.450
Why kill the illegal as well?

25:16.480 --> 25:17.730
Silencing a witness.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.590
Well,then why move the bodies?

25:19.630 --> 25:22.050
Maybe he was trying to hide them.

25:22.100 --> 25:26.660
How does hiding the bodies send any kind of message to other coyotes?

25:26.710 --> 25:27.990
If you were going to hide the bodies,

25:28.010 --> 25:30.470
why put them where they were so easy to find?

25:30.490 --> 25:32.290
You know,I'm just kind of thinking out loud.

25:32.330 --> 25:34.120
Well,let's try thinking quietly for a little while.

25:34.150 --> 25:36.550
Might be a little more productive.

25:40.370 --> 25:43.240
please tell me you're here to give me my car back.

25:43.780 --> 25:46.470
Have you finished those reports?

25:47.350 --> 25:49.890
There are over 50 different forms here.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.040
That's how we determine the truth.

25:52.070 --> 25:53.410
The truth?

25:53.450 --> 25:54.860
Ok...

25:55.500 --> 25:59.710
that man,mr. Carson,there is no way that he is really injured.

25:59.730 --> 26:01.240
He is a liar.

26:01.270 --> 26:02.540
And an opportunist.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.800
And my tail light was broken,

26:04.820 --> 26:05.600
and my cell phone,

26:05.620 --> 26:07.120
and you don't see me accusing anybody--

26:07.160 --> 26:11.570
so you were talking on your cell phone when the accident occurred.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.680
Captain west...

26:14.140 --> 26:19.650
I realize that a lot of people in this building resent the fact that I am an outsider.

26:19.680 --> 26:25.950
But that is no reason to waste the lapd's precious resources on this silly investigation.

26:25.970 --> 26:27.180
Silly?

26:27.200 --> 26:32.150
Do you know there are just as many automobile fatalities every year in L.A. As there are murders?

26:32.170 --> 26:36.760
And unlike the dead hookers,dealers,and gang bangers that you investigate,

26:36.780 --> 26:40.030
people care about the victims of auto accidents.

26:40.060 --> 26:41.440
They mourn them.

26:41.470 --> 26:45.410
They build shrines to them by the side of the road.

26:45.430 --> 26:48.650
There is nothing silly about what I do.

26:48.650 --> 26:52.800
It's a serious job,and one worthy of respect.

26:52.870 --> 26:56.230
Please fill out those reports,ma'am.

26:58.010 --> 27:01.370
They build shrines to them.

27:01.510 --> 27:04.160
Yes. They do.

27:12.460 --> 27:13.440
Detective daniels.

27:13.470 --> 27:13.920
Yeah.

27:13.940 --> 27:16.150
When you were bagging that debris,you said you found some candles?

27:16.180 --> 27:17.100
Where are they?

27:17.130 --> 27:20.360
Uh,they are in evidence,but I have photos.

27:29.810 --> 27:32.240
Those are catholic prayer candles.

27:32.300 --> 27:35.770
Uh,chief,you care to share with the rest of the class?

27:35.800 --> 27:38.070
Someone put up a shrine.

27:38.480 --> 27:42.430
I want to know about every death that occurred within a 1-mile radius of where we found that truck last night,

27:42.450 --> 27:44.510
car accidents,shootings,dead pets,anything.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.540
Go back 5 years.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.340
Our killer was sending a message.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.210
But it wasn't to his employees.

27:51.250 --> 27:52.860
Chief,it's the hospital.

27:52.890 --> 27:55.570
The doctor wants to release hugo.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.030
Chief?

28:06.340 --> 28:08.370
If this is about your traffic issue,I told you,I can't help you.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.800
No,no. Never mind about that,

28:09.820 --> 28:11.500
but I need your help to solve a problem.

28:11.540 --> 28:12.340
Ok,I'm listening.

28:12.360 --> 28:13.370
Scared,but listening.

28:13.410 --> 28:15.490
My witness has recovered.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.380
And the problem?

28:16.400 --> 28:18.790
I need him not to be released from the hospital.

28:18.820 --> 28:20.830
I can't force the hospital to hold a patient,

28:20.860 --> 28:24.330
especially an illegal immigrant with no insurance.

28:24.360 --> 28:27.280
He'll disappear the moment they sign him out.

28:27.300 --> 28:30.310
If you say you can't find a way to bend the rules to help me,I'm gonna scream.

28:30.330 --> 28:34.620
So call immigration,call the doctor,call whatever,just call in a favor.

28:34.750 --> 28:37.130
You remember what favors are,don't you,will?

28:37.160 --> 28:41.240
Mm-hmm. Things you do for people without expecting anything in return.

28:43.400 --> 28:44.710
All right.

28:44.820 --> 28:48.480
I can authorize a couple of weeks of protective custody.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.010
Thank you.

28:55.720 --> 28:59.000
Ok,we looked at the 5 years of incident reports.

28:59.050 --> 29:03.040
Tickets,et cetera,you know,near where we found our bodies.

29:03.080 --> 29:07.030
There are no traffic accidents,no gang activity,

29:07.060 --> 29:09.920
quite a bit of prostitution though.

29:09.970 --> 29:15.690
Which might explain why your dear friends over in traffic were so quick to stumble on that truck.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.380
Oh,speaking of trucks.

29:17.420 --> 29:20.940
We did come across an interesting case from about 3 years ago.

29:20.960 --> 29:24.880
Yeah,someone drove a truck from tijuana to L.A.

29:24.910 --> 29:26.700
Then abandoned it.

29:26.740 --> 29:29.760
Now,it had a refrigeration unit in the rear.

29:29.790 --> 29:31.180
But they failed to turn it on.

29:31.200 --> 29:34.220
So 15 illegals locked inside cooked to death.

29:34.230 --> 29:40.900
They came across the vehicle in a vacant lot which is now the construction site where our truck was found.

29:40.940 --> 29:42.910
The fbi handled the case.

29:42.940 --> 29:45.070
They sent us a copy of their files.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.370
And they did get some prints from the truck cab,

29:47.390 --> 29:49.110
but nothing else ever came up.

29:49.140 --> 29:51.160
We should run those prints against our dead coyote.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.770
They ever id any of the victims?

29:52.800 --> 29:53.860
No. Not all of them,

29:53.890 --> 29:57.000
but some of them have some relatives living here in L.A.

29:57.020 --> 30:00.300
This is a partial list,now remember,it's a couple of years old.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.750
Where have I heard of aylesworth place before?

30:02.770 --> 30:03.880
It's in lincoln heights.

30:03.910 --> 30:07.060
That's the same place we got the nibin hit on our murder weapon.

30:07.090 --> 30:07.530
Right.

30:07.550 --> 30:10.960
Unsolved gang shooting on aylesworth place.

30:11.230 --> 30:18.030
Ok. 3 years ago,the bodies of mr. And mrs.David gonzales were found dead in the back of that truck.

30:18.060 --> 30:19.480
Bodies were claimed by their son,

30:19.510 --> 30:24.160
carlos gonzales of 211 aylesworth place apartment D.

30:24.180 --> 30:28.490
Is it just me,or does this all seem like an enormous coincidence?

30:28.540 --> 30:30.860
I'm just thinking out loud here...

30:30.880 --> 30:33.910
but we should pick up carlos gonzales.

30:38.830 --> 30:42.040
hey,I finally figured out a solution to your captain west problem.

30:42.070 --> 30:43.690
Oh,yeah,what's that?

30:43.710 --> 30:44.750
Fill in the reports.

30:44.750 --> 30:46.600
Oh,so you're taking his side now.

30:46.630 --> 30:47.870
No,I'm just saying,

30:47.890 --> 30:49.940
this whole thing is making you crazy.

30:49.970 --> 30:53.650
And whatever you're doing to make him go away,isn't working.

30:53.670 --> 30:59.000
I will not dignify his baseless accusation by responding to it.

30:59.030 --> 31:00.330
Brenda...

31:01.650 --> 31:03.400
I've come up against guys like west.

31:03.420 --> 31:04.730
They're machines.

31:04.760 --> 31:07.180
You have to either play them or get used to losing.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.530
Then you mean politics.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.540
Well,yeah.

31:10.570 --> 31:13.290
So you want me to lie and cheat like everybody else.

31:13.310 --> 31:15.080
That is not the only way to be political.

31:15.110 --> 31:18.100
Well,I will not stoop to bullying and...

31:18.130 --> 31:20.140
using people.

31:21.670 --> 31:23.550
Oh,and,uh...

31:23.560 --> 31:25.830
I need you to drive me to work.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.300
Are they going to send me back?

31:33.450 --> 31:37.260
No. I had my boss pull some strings.

31:37.280 --> 31:38.730
You're in protective custody.

31:38.770 --> 31:40.740
In fact,I was gonna keep this as a surprise,

31:40.770 --> 31:45.290
but I'm working on getting you a work visa so you can stay in america legally.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.880
Thank you.

31:46.930 --> 31:47.960
Thank you very much.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.250
Well,that's the least we could do...

31:52.420 --> 31:54.520
given your cooperation.

31:58.930 --> 32:00.870
You must be hugo.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.360
Feeling better?

32:02.390 --> 32:04.680
Si. Gracias.

32:04.730 --> 32:06.540
This is detective daniels.

32:06.560 --> 32:09.730
She and sergeant gabriel will help you with your visa application.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.670
But I just need you to do one thing for me first.

32:12.700 --> 32:16.940
We believe that we may have found the person that you identified as the shooter.

32:16.960 --> 32:21.450
But I just want to warn you,that it does not look good.

32:23.450 --> 32:26.090
Is this the man who shot you?

32:26.300 --> 32:28.110
Si.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.050
But who killed him?

32:30.090 --> 32:33.130
Well,we have a man in custody we believe may have been involved,

32:33.150 --> 32:35.090
but we should get you started on your application.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.690
Carlos gonzales,you have the right to remain silent.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.540
Anything you say can and will...

32:40.560 --> 32:42.480
oh,I'm,I'M...

32:44.050 --> 32:46.290
are you all right,hugo?

32:46.390 --> 32:47.840
Is it that man?

32:47.870 --> 32:48.840
Do you know him?

32:48.860 --> 32:53.110
No. I'm uncomfortable,and my leg,it hurts a little.

32:53.150 --> 32:54.550
I'm sorry.

32:54.570 --> 32:56.400
No,I'm sorry.

32:56.420 --> 32:58.860
I've been dragging you all over the city.

32:58.890 --> 33:00.890
But you'll be on your way soon.

33:01.340 --> 33:07.820
Detective daniels and sergeant gabriel will help you get your pictures,prints,and signature for your visa.

33:10.010 --> 33:11.140
Right this way.

33:18.530 --> 33:21.080
Well,gentlemen,how are we doing?

33:21.150 --> 33:23.110
He's not much of a talker.

33:23.140 --> 33:25.250
I don't have nothing to say.

33:25.410 --> 33:28.410
Oh,I think that's a mistake,carlos.

33:28.470 --> 33:29.880
I know what you did.

33:29.910 --> 33:31.890
I found that gun in your apartment.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.530
I want to give you a chance to tell me why.

33:33.550 --> 33:35.250
I don't know what you're talking about.

33:35.270 --> 33:38.520
I'm talking about the men you murdered two days ago.

33:38.970 --> 33:42.310
I have the evidence to prove that you did it,carlos.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.990
But if you cooperate with me,

33:44.010 --> 33:46.360
I can help save your life.

33:51.590 --> 33:53.790
This was a bad man.

33:54.970 --> 33:58.740
We matched his fingerprints with the prints we found in the truck where your parents died.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.620
He was the driver.

34:00.830 --> 34:04.330
What I need to know is this,how did you find him?

34:04.350 --> 34:07.090
The fbi couldn't,how could you?

34:11.360 --> 34:13.480
You think about what I said,carlos.

34:13.500 --> 34:14.820
You were smart enough to plan this,

34:14.840 --> 34:17.880
you are smart enough to help me finish it.

34:22.830 --> 34:25.239
Hugo's visa application.

34:25.260 --> 34:26.880
It's all in there.

34:26.980 --> 34:28.350
Thank you.

34:34.090 --> 34:35.870
Brenda,I was just coming to see how it's going.

34:35.909 --> 34:37.820
I'll let you know when I'm done.

34:37.860 --> 34:38.800
Oh,will.

34:40.530 --> 34:41.969
I've been thinking,

34:41.989 --> 34:46.280
I've decided to take a more positive approach with captain west.

34:46.310 --> 34:47.850
Really?

34:48.020 --> 34:49.630
Why?

34:49.739 --> 34:53.050
Well,the traffic department did help us find our missing dead bodies,

34:53.080 --> 34:55.600
and we can't overlook that.

34:55.630 --> 34:56.630
Uh-huh. We?

34:56.659 --> 35:00.480
The thing is,I'm gonna kind of need a little favor.

35:00.560 --> 35:01.100
No,no,no.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.380
You wouldn't be doing the favor for me,

35:02.410 --> 35:03.870
you'd be doing the favor for someone else.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.920
Would you do that for me?

35:05.990 --> 35:07.830
Uh,what--would i do what for whom?

35:07.850 --> 35:09.100
We can talk about this later.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.960
I'm almost done,but thank you,will.

35:11.990 --> 35:13.900
Thank you so much.

35:20.580 --> 35:22.220
Good news,hugo.

35:22.260 --> 35:24.670
You get to stay in america.

35:25.660 --> 35:27.200
I don't know how to thank you.

35:27.230 --> 35:29.320
In fact,you'll be staying here a very long time.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.010
What's 15 times 20?

35:31.040 --> 35:32.560
300.

35:32.880 --> 35:33.630
What?

35:33.670 --> 35:37.340
That's how many years you're likely to stay in a good old american prison.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.600
Provided that you live that long.

35:39.620 --> 35:46.040
See,hugo,the fingerprints you provided to detective daniels for your work visa application,

35:46.060 --> 35:51.270
they match a set of prints the fbi found on the steering wheel of a truck 3 years ago.

35:51.280 --> 35:53.490
That jog your memory?

35:53.730 --> 35:57.800
Do you remember,for example,leaving 15 of your countrymen,

35:57.830 --> 35:59.960
including 4 women and 1 child,

35:59.990 --> 36:02.670
to cook to death in the back of that truck?

36:05.750 --> 36:07.140
That's not true.

36:07.170 --> 36:09.050
I'm not a coyote.

36:09.090 --> 36:12.620
There were three sets of prints found in the cab of that truck.

36:12.660 --> 36:15.170
Yours and the two dead guys from that house.

36:15.190 --> 36:19.570
Oh,and your friend with the,uh,tattoo on his neck here,

36:19.600 --> 36:21.800
he didn't try to kill you,hugo.

36:21.830 --> 36:23.410
He was your partner.

36:23.430 --> 36:27.640
And that boy who walked past you in the hallway,carlos gonzales,

36:27.670 --> 36:30.220
he was the shooter,wasn't he?

36:31.380 --> 36:33.790
How did he find you?

36:34.010 --> 36:37.110
How did he know who you were?

36:38.380 --> 36:41.980
If you help me,I can help you.

36:43.170 --> 36:44.820
No.

36:45.290 --> 36:47.950
I want a lawyer.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.880
I want to call a lawyer.

36:52.840 --> 36:54.850
Given the physical evidence we have on you,

36:54.880 --> 36:58.510
and the percentage of perspective jurors in L.A. County that are mexican immigrants,

36:58.540 --> 37:02.760
you had better call yourself a good one,my friend.

37:15.460 --> 37:19.290
Detective sanchez,I need you to hold your fire until I give you the signal,ok?

37:19.480 --> 37:20.850
All right.

37:22.540 --> 37:23.830
Carlos.

37:24.800 --> 37:28.310
You saw that man I was with earlier in the hallway,didn't you?

37:28.340 --> 37:29.770
I know you did.

37:29.810 --> 37:32.550
Do you recognize him because he recognized you.

37:32.570 --> 37:35.600
He identified you as the person who tried to kill him.

37:37.940 --> 37:40.190
I think he had something to do with killing your parents.

37:40.220 --> 37:43.060
Now if you tell me how you found him,I can arrest him,carlos.

37:43.090 --> 37:46.390
He'll go to jail for a good long time.

37:47.500 --> 37:48.740
No?

37:48.780 --> 37:51.770
All right,then,I guess I'll just have to release him and charge you with murder.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.020
You can't let him go.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.320
That man's a murderer.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.180
If he killed 50 white people,you wouldn't let him go.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.610
If he killed 50 white--you don't care!

37:58.630 --> 38:00.790
Detective sanchez,what are you doing?

38:00.790 --> 38:03.010
Let go of that man this instant!

38:03.050 --> 38:07.280
Diles lo que paso,y te ponemos en la misma carcel del coyote.

38:08.310 --> 38:09.940
Si.

38:10.190 --> 38:12.280
Hey,you speak spanish,buzz.What'd he just say?

38:12.310 --> 38:13.440
Take your seat.Immediately.

38:13.480 --> 38:14.290
I don't know.

38:14.310 --> 38:15.900
I can't hear him over chief johnson.

38:15.930 --> 38:18.560
Detective sanchez,sit down. Right now.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.220
Yes,ma'am.

38:23.130 --> 38:24.480
Sit.

38:27.510 --> 38:29.910
I'm so sorry about that.

38:30.310 --> 38:32.500
He is a very emotional man.

38:32.520 --> 38:36.690
Now,let's all calm down,and I'll ask you again.

38:36.730 --> 38:37.550
Carlos...

38:37.570 --> 38:40.850
what happened between you and those coyotes?

38:46.120 --> 38:47.240
I killed them.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.770
Why?

38:49.880 --> 38:52.820
My family and I came here 5 years ago.

38:53.350 --> 38:57.320
My father gave every penny he had to get us across the border.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.530
We couldn't believe it when we made it to the U.S.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.850
We were so happy.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.550
Then we got terrible news.

39:06.580 --> 39:09.090
My grandmother was dying.

39:09.660 --> 39:12.660
And my mother and father went to go be with her.

39:12.810 --> 39:14.650
How long were they gone for?

39:14.670 --> 39:15.800
They were supposed to come right back,

39:15.830 --> 39:19.330
but the border patrol stopped them and sent them home.

39:19.770 --> 39:23.400
So they went to the same coyote we used the first time.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.320
And they paid a lot of money.

39:26.360 --> 39:27.740
Again.

39:27.780 --> 39:29.590
And then when they crossed the border,

39:29.610 --> 39:32.650
those coyotes just let my parents die in the back of the truck.

39:32.810 --> 39:34.460
And no one even cared.

39:34.490 --> 39:37.260
After 2 weeks,it wasn't even in the paper anymore.

39:37.300 --> 39:39.410
But you remembered.

39:39.450 --> 39:43.760
You lit candles for them and put them in the place where the bodies were found.

39:44.930 --> 39:47.370
My sister and I...

39:50.520 --> 39:53.880
we prayed that god would punish those men.

39:54.270 --> 39:56.600
But nothing happened.

39:56.740 --> 39:59.080
I was losing faith.

40:00.710 --> 40:03.250
Then there was a shootout where I lived.

40:03.280 --> 40:05.530
One guy threw his gun in the bushes in front of our building,

40:05.550 --> 40:07.040
and I knew god heard me.

40:07.070 --> 40:07.930
And you took that gun,

40:07.960 --> 40:11.500
and you went back to mexico just like your parents did.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.800
And I hired the same coyotes that they used before.

40:14.860 --> 40:16.880
They didn't remember me.

40:17.360 --> 40:20.840
I was much younger when they brought us across the first time.

40:21.540 --> 40:24.180
But I remembered them.

40:24.720 --> 40:27.480
So why didn't you kill them as soon as they picked you up?

40:27.850 --> 40:29.500
The other people.

40:29.530 --> 40:31.290
I didn't want anyone else to get hurt.

40:31.320 --> 40:34.690
So you let these coyotes bring y'all all the way back to los angeles.

40:34.720 --> 40:37.980
Si. Ah,yes.

40:39.670 --> 40:41.770
And I waited.

40:41.980 --> 40:48.500
I watched them take more money from these people before they let them go.

40:52.380 --> 40:54.640
Those cowards.

40:59.360 --> 41:02.380
And finally,I was the last.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.020
And I paid them for what they had done.

41:07.420 --> 41:11.480
I made them kneel on the floor,and I shot them.

41:11.790 --> 41:15.750
That guy got away,but I killed the other two.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.180
And then you spat in their faces.

41:24.790 --> 41:27.470
Yes. Yes.

41:39.340 --> 41:43.290
I need you to wipe this along the side of your cheek.

41:53.450 --> 41:56.030
I did what I did for justice.

41:57.660 --> 42:00.590
I know that,carlos.

42:00.790 --> 42:04.360
But that kind of justice is against our laws.

42:04.390 --> 42:07.990
Your laws didn't work for my parents.

42:19.080 --> 42:23.540
I don't think I've ever seen anybody flip so quickly.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.250
Yeah.

42:27.890 --> 42:30.110
I guess he thought if he confessed,

42:30.150 --> 42:32.210
he'd end up in the same prison as hugo.

42:32.240 --> 42:36.640
Now where in the world would he get an idea like that?

42:43.940 --> 42:48.530
Too often,captain west,the efforts of you and your department are overlooked.

42:48.560 --> 42:54.870
But deputy chief johnson has brought to our attention the invaluable contributions of your department in resolving 17 homicides,

42:54.890 --> 42:58.400
and it occurred to me that such work deserves recognition.

42:58.410 --> 43:05.720
And so it is with great respect and gratitude that I present to you this commendation.

43:05.770 --> 43:06.880
Good work,captain.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.010
Thank you.

43:08.050 --> 43:09.600
Congratulations.

43:09.620 --> 43:10.540
Thanks.

43:11.440 --> 43:12.790
Well done.

43:12.820 --> 43:14.880
Uh,let's get a picture.

43:15.380 --> 43:19.470
Oh,no. No,no,no.

43:25.570 --> 43:26.900
There's a guy out there.

43:26.940 --> 43:28.500
I'm gonna have to go. Ma'am.

43:28.530 --> 43:29.940
Commander.

43:33.110 --> 43:34.530
Thank you...

43:34.600 --> 43:35.960
ma'am.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.130
Thank you.

43:51.250 --> 43:53.520
Whatever. Those medals are a dime a dozen.

43:53.550 --> 43:54.990
Well...

43:55.160 --> 43:56.810
thank you.
