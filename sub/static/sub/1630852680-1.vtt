- What was my best line? I don't know.

00:35.340 --> 00:36.840
My jokes are like my children.

00:39.211 --> 00:42.223
I have no favorites.

00:45.310 --> 00:46.490
- From an early age,

I just wanna do good work.

01:05.922 --> 01:07.770
And if I got the right offer,

01:07.770 --> 01:11.210
if the creators of "The
Simpsons" called me up tomorrow

01:11.210 --> 01:13.709
or if Larry David called me up tomorrow

01:13.709 --> 01:16.003
and said he had a great idea, I'd be open.

01:18.220 --> 01:19.910
I get laughs, so I'll mix it up.

01:19.910 --> 01:23.000
Comedy, drama, not totally drama.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.850
I'm not gonna play Hannibal
Lecter or anything,

01:24.850 --> 01:27.223
but I can do stuff like this.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.373
Yeah, I'm always trying to
get laughs, I'll say that.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.593

01:34.593 --> 01:36.320
From the time you were like four?

01:36.320 --> 01:40.310
- From the time the doctor
smacked me on my ass

01:40.310 --> 01:42.304
and I said, "Give me another one."

01:44.701 --> 01:47.425
Then I go, "Hey, didn't we just meet?"

01:51.275 --> 01:53.166
- Have
you ever bombed onstage

01:53.166 --> 01:53.999
in real life?
- Yeah,

01:53.999 --> 01:56.240
I bomb all the time.
- Really?

01:56.240 --> 01:57.490
When I started out, yeah.

01:58.729 --> 02:00.810
If they paid me for
jokes that didn't work,

02:00.810 --> 02:02.918
yeah, I'd be richer than Bill Gates.

02:05.970 --> 02:07.330
- His characters in movies

02:07.330 --> 02:09.630
and standup leave lasting impressions

02:09.630 --> 02:11.163
in the minds of his fans.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.710
With standup comedy being his first love,

02:15.710 --> 02:18.140
Chris always returns to his roots

02:18.140 --> 02:21.343
and what he does best,
making people laugh.

02:23.900 --> 02:28.760
- I was blessed to have
a father in my life.

02:28.760 --> 02:29.600
True, true.

02:29.600 --> 02:34.600
I had two parent, family,
in the hood in Bed-Stuy.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.670
Yup. Yup.

02:39.670 --> 02:41.530
People would come
around, look at my father

02:41.530 --> 02:43.348
like it was a science
project or something,

02:43.348 --> 02:48.348
like put him in a glass case
someday and charge people.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.010
Christopher Julius Rock was born

02:56.010 --> 03:01.010
in Andrew, South Carolina
on February 7th, 1965.

03:01.060 --> 03:03.740
Shortly after his birth,
his parents relocated

03:03.740 --> 03:07.130
to the Crown Heights neighborhood
of Brooklyn, New York.

03:07.130 --> 03:10.190
His mother, Rosalie, was a
teacher and social worker,

03:10.190 --> 03:12.640
and his father, Julius, was a truck driver

03:12.640 --> 03:14.263
and newspaper delivery man.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.560
Chris is the oldest of his siblings

03:17.560 --> 03:19.810
and has three younger
brothers who followed

03:19.810 --> 03:22.920
in his footsteps in the
entertainment industry.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.660
He has often spoken about
his main influence coming

03:25.660 --> 03:28.290
from his paternal grandfather, Allen Rock,

03:28.290 --> 03:29.663
who worked as a preacher.

03:31.140 --> 03:33.270
In the late 60s, early 70s,

03:33.270 --> 03:35.510
Brooklyn's neighborhoods
were mostly populated

03:35.510 --> 03:36.920
by white families.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.910
Chris has spoken about the
racial discrimination he faced

03:39.910 --> 03:43.130
because of his skin color
during his school years.

03:43.130 --> 03:44.770
He was regularly beaten up

03:44.770 --> 03:47.680
and eventually stopped
attending high school for good

03:47.680 --> 03:50.670
but still received a
general education diploma.

03:50.670 --> 03:53.950
His bitter experience with
racism during his school years

03:53.950 --> 03:56.893
had a large influence on
his career as a comedian.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.570
- I'm always trying to
get laughs, I'll say that.

04:01.470 --> 04:02.303
- From the time when?

04:02.303 --> 04:04.070
From the time you were like four?

04:04.070 --> 04:08.040
- From the time the doctor
smacked me on my ass

04:08.040 --> 04:10.111
and I said, "Give me another one."

04:12.394 --> 04:14.294
Then I go, "Hey, didn't we just meet?"

04:18.120 --> 04:19.690
- After dropping out of school,

04:19.690 --> 04:22.380
Chris did odd jobs at
several fast food joints

04:22.380 --> 04:24.690
and cafeterias to make ends meet.

04:24.690 --> 04:28.520
He laid the foundations of
his standup career in 1984

04:28.520 --> 04:30.010
by performing in the nightclubs

04:30.010 --> 04:31.853
and comedy clubs of New York City.

04:32.990 --> 04:35.610
In 1985, he was in line to buy tickets

04:35.610 --> 04:37.500
to an Eddie Murphy standup performance

04:37.500 --> 04:40.930
at Radio City Music Hall when
he saw an ad in the newspaper

04:40.930 --> 04:44.550
for an open mic night at the
club Catch a Rising Star.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.253
He auditioned and scored his first gig.

04:49.170 --> 04:50.410
Catch a Rising Star was

04:50.410 --> 04:52.460
where many other celebrated comedians

04:52.460 --> 04:55.860
had showed off their skills,
names such as Eddie Murphy,

04:55.860 --> 04:58.513
Adam Sandler, and Jerry Seinfeld.

04:59.650 --> 05:02.710
Chris Rock cleaned tables
at the Comic Strip Live,

05:02.710 --> 05:05.230
the oldest comedy club in New York City.

05:05.230 --> 05:08.393
He did this in order to gain
some extra onstage time.

05:09.450 --> 05:12.410
The acclaimed comedian
and actor Eddie Murphy

05:12.410 --> 05:15.090
spotted Chris performing
at the Comic Strip,

05:15.090 --> 05:17.240
and being impressed by his performance,

05:17.240 --> 05:20.210
he offered him the part
of Playboy mansion valet

05:20.210 --> 05:23.720
in the 1987 film "Beverly Hills Cop II."

05:23.720 --> 05:26.098
This was his debut movie role.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.260
- Yo, yo, yo, what the
is up, man? Check this out.

05:34.260 --> 05:37.920
I get $10 for cars. I get $20 for limos.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.413
What the hell is is?

05:40.410 --> 05:43.383
- My truck. Here's $50.

05:44.570 --> 05:45.770
Put it next to the limo.

05:46.700 --> 05:49.570
- In 1990,
after gaining popularity,

05:49.570 --> 05:52.350
he was selected to join
"Saturday Night Live,"

05:52.350 --> 05:55.580
the hugely popular comedy
series that put him on par

05:55.580 --> 05:58.133
with other newly recruited members.

06:00.340 --> 06:04.090
Himself, along with Adam
Sandler, David Spade,

06:04.090 --> 06:07.290
Rob Schneider, and Chris
Farley became known

06:07.290 --> 06:09.203
as the bad boys of SNL.

06:10.060 --> 06:11.670
The following year, he came up

06:11.670 --> 06:15.107
with his first comedy album
titled "Born Suspect."

06:16.700 --> 06:19.100
He appeared in a total of 59 episodes

06:19.100 --> 06:22.670
of "Saturday Night
Live" from 1990 to 1993,

06:22.670 --> 06:25.810
and in these three years,
he earned a nationwide fame

06:25.810 --> 06:28.500
and recognition as a comedian.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.280
His striking and evocative
portrayal of Pookie,

06:31.280 --> 06:34.030
a cocaine addict in the
movie "New Jack City,"

06:34.030 --> 06:36.653
was lauded by his fans and film critics.

06:37.770 --> 06:40.860
Chris was quietly planning to
quit "SNL" following the end

06:40.860 --> 06:44.290
of the 1992-93 season, but he was laid off

06:44.290 --> 06:46.460
and dropped unceremoniously much

06:46.460 --> 06:48.363
before the season came to an end.

06:49.390 --> 06:51.860
He was then featured as
a guest actor in a total

06:51.860 --> 06:54.940
of six episodes in the 1993-94 season

06:54.940 --> 06:57.460
of the comedy series "In Living Color,"

06:57.460 --> 06:58.960
but the serial's broadcasting

06:58.960 --> 07:00.993
was discontinued shortly after.

07:02.490 --> 07:05.040
In 1993, Chris Rock scripted

07:05.040 --> 07:08.270
and co-produced the comedy film "CB4,"

07:08.270 --> 07:11.010
as well as played a
double role in the movie.

07:11.010 --> 07:13.630
The movie was about a guy
who makes a documentary

07:13.630 --> 07:15.879
on a rap group called CB4.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.880
- Now CB4 is one of
the hottest hip hop groups

07:19.880 --> 07:22.539
to come on the scene in
a very, very long time.

07:25.690 --> 07:29.993
I'm MC Gusto, but in
prison, I'm known as 97-KY.

07:31.747 --> 07:34.820
- "CB4," which was
made on a shoestring budget,

07:34.820 --> 07:37.480
was a modest blockbuster, earning revenues

07:37.480 --> 07:39.593
nearly three times the movie budget.

07:40.930 --> 07:42.480
Chris went on to appear in a string

07:42.480 --> 07:47.430
of comedy specials endorsed
by HBO from 1994 to 2008

07:47.430 --> 07:49.940
that brought him unprecedented success

07:49.940 --> 07:52.963
and made him a household name
in the entertainment industry.

07:54.660 --> 07:57.677
He first appeared in the
HBO-sponsored comedy special,

07:57.677 --> 08:01.547
"Big Ass Jokes," in 1994
followed by the special,

08:01.547 --> 08:03.710
"Bring the Pain," in 1996.

08:03.710 --> 08:06.390
- I'm just at another point in my life.

08:06.390 --> 08:09.740
Time to settle down. Time to settle down.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.420
That's what time it is,
time to settle down.

08:12.420 --> 08:14.930
Women always ready to settle down.

08:14.930 --> 08:16.380
And see, a woman go and your date.

08:16.380 --> 08:18.089
She's like, "Why are we ?

08:19.590 --> 08:21.177
What are you waiting for?"

08:22.410 --> 08:24.460
Men never ready to settle down.

08:24.460 --> 08:27.123
Men don't settle down. We surrender.

08:28.677 --> 08:30.694
"All right, I'll marry
your ass, all right?"

08:32.530 --> 08:33.690
- His moving performance

08:33.690 --> 08:36.700
in "Bring the Pain"
merited him two Emmy awards

08:36.700 --> 08:37.960
and established him as one

08:37.960 --> 08:41.513
of the most accomplished satirists
in the US comedy circuit.

08:42.380 --> 08:45.210
He won two Emmy awards for the special

08:45.210 --> 08:47.173
and gained large critical acclaim.

08:48.540 --> 08:50.240
- What does it say about the Emmy?

08:52.600 --> 08:56.240
I would say they really listen.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.990
They really watched it carefully,

08:57.990 --> 08:59.070
and I think they really listened,

08:59.070 --> 09:03.477
and they weren't swayed
by profanity or anything.

09:03.477 --> 09:06.150
They just really got into the content

09:06.150 --> 09:08.190
of what I was trying to say.

09:08.190 --> 09:10.607
It was just me. It wasn't
a big show or anything.

09:10.607 --> 09:12.623
It was just me and a microphone,

09:14.690 --> 09:19.090
and I didn't beat, but they
chose me over huge productions

09:19.090 --> 09:21.610
and the Oscars and the Bette Midler thing.

09:21.610 --> 09:25.420
And a lot of people don't
respect standup comedy

09:25.420 --> 09:27.420
as something hard.

09:27.420 --> 09:32.030
I never in my wildest dreams
thought I would be up here

09:32.030 --> 09:35.229
with two Emmy awards, even
get nominated for an Emmy.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.660
- Adding to his popularity

09:38.660 --> 09:41.510
was his much publicized
role as a commentator

09:41.510 --> 09:43.870
for Comedy Central's
"Politically Incorrect"

09:43.870 --> 09:46.840
during the 1996 presidential elections,

09:46.840 --> 09:49.680
for which he earned
another Emmy nomination.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.870
Chris also was the voice
for the Little Penny puppet

09:52.870 --> 09:56.220
who was the alter ego to
basketball star Penny Hardaway

09:56.220 --> 10:00.461
in a series of Nike shoe
commercials from 1994 to 1998.

10:00.461 --> 10:02.750
- Game last night. Let
me just put it this way.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.640
You're the best player in the NBA.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.223
Those spin moves and the dunks, oh!

10:06.223 --> 10:08.120
Ooh, swish, slam the glass side,

10:08.120 --> 10:09.750
and do some Tai Chi to calm himself down.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.300
- Man, you are having a party.

10:11.300 --> 10:15.610
I swear, if you and your sloppy
friends messing up my house-

10:15.610 --> 10:16.715
- Ah, thanks, baby. Meet me by the pool.

10:16.715 --> 10:18.483
- Hello?
- Hey, hey! I can't talk now.

10:18.483 --> 10:20.680
I driving through a tunnel.
- Hello?

10:20.680 --> 10:22.160
- In 1996,

10:22.160 --> 10:25.810
Chris married his longtime
girlfriend, Malaak Compton.

10:25.810 --> 10:28.790
The couple lived together
in Alpine, New Jersey.

10:28.790 --> 10:32.150
Malaak gave birth to his
first daughter, Lola Simone,

10:32.150 --> 10:34.720
in 2002, and their second daughter,

10:34.720 --> 10:37.453
Zahra Savannah, was born in 2004.

10:41.630 --> 10:43.780
- I think I said this
before with the black shows.

10:43.780 --> 10:47.490
I was raised in an era to
believe if you're black,

10:47.490 --> 10:49.220
you have to do things twice as good

10:49.220 --> 10:51.960
as the white man in order to succeed.

10:51.960 --> 10:56.340
And the shows that are on now,
like when "Sanford and Son"

10:56.340 --> 10:59.260
was on, it's way better than
every white show that was on

10:59.260 --> 11:01.790
at the time and "The
Jeffersons" and everything.

11:01.790 --> 11:05.550
And right now, some brothers
are submitting shows

11:05.550 --> 11:07.070
that are as good as white people's,

11:07.070 --> 11:09.113
and you gotta you gotta be better.

11:10.140 --> 11:13.517
This show's better
than "Mr. Show."

11:15.030 --> 11:16.985
If it was as good, I wouldn't win.

11:26.490 --> 11:29.210
Chris Rock's immense success
as a standup comedian

11:29.210 --> 11:31.670
towards the end of the 1990s helped him

11:31.670 --> 11:34.203
to bag crucial roles in feature films,

11:35.330 --> 11:38.083
many of which went on
to become blockbusters.

11:39.970 --> 11:42.690
Initially, he fulfilled
supporting parts in movies

11:42.690 --> 11:45.427
like "Beverly Hills
Ninja," "Lethal weapon 4,"

11:45.427 --> 11:49.017
"Nurse Betty," "Sgt.
Bilko," and "The Immortals."

11:53.677 --> 11:55.470
"Lethal Weapon 4" was one

11:55.470 --> 11:57.990
of his most recognizable early roles,

11:57.990 --> 12:01.200
as it was already a larger franchise.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.780
- The guy you chased through Chinatown?

12:02.780 --> 12:03.613
- Yeah.

12:03.613 --> 12:06.100
- The gun he dropped match
slugs on the body on the boat.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.100
That's your shooter.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.597
- Son of a
bitch that got away from me.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.040
- Oh, he didn't get too far.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.430
They found him on a
rooftop nearby, strangled.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.833
And get this, pigeons ate his eyeballs.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.157
- Chris later had
two more HBO comedy specials,

12:23.157 --> 12:27.863
"Bigger and Blacker" in 1999
and "Never Scared" in 2004.

12:30.690 --> 12:32.700
Articles relating to both specials

12:32.700 --> 12:35.110
called Chris "the funniest man in America"

12:35.110 --> 12:38.060
in "Time" Magazine and
"Entertainment Weekly."

12:38.060 --> 12:43.060
- Oh, I am not the funniest
man alive, not by a long shot.

12:43.740 --> 12:47.260
I think Adam Sandler's got receipts

12:47.260 --> 12:49.290
that prove he's a little funnier.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.030
- Eddie Murphy?
- Eddie Murphy,

12:51.030 --> 12:53.400
Will Smith, when he wants
to make people laugh,

12:53.400 --> 12:54.793
can really do it well.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.450
I'm just the funniest guy that showed up

12:57.450 --> 12:58.881
to talk to you today.

12:58.881 --> 13:00.780
- Brilliant.
Well, thank you very much.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.647
- HBO also aired his talk show,

13:03.647 --> 13:06.610
"The Chris Rock Show," which
gained critical acclaim

13:06.610 --> 13:09.433
for his interviews with
celebrities and politicians.

13:10.510 --> 13:12.530
The show won an Emmy for writing.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.600
His television work has won him a total

13:14.600 --> 13:17.643
of three Emmy awards and 15 nominations.

13:21.410 --> 13:23.840
By the end of the decade,
Rock was established

13:23.840 --> 13:26.150
as one of the preeminent standup comedians

13:26.150 --> 13:28.243
and comic minds of his generation.

13:29.360 --> 13:32.650
During this time, Rock
also translated his comedy

13:32.650 --> 13:35.460
into print form in the book "Rock This!"

13:35.460 --> 13:38.097
and release the Grammy
award-winning comedy albums,

13:38.097 --> 13:40.500
"Roll with the New," "Bigger and Blacker,"

13:40.500 --> 13:41.797
and "Never Scared."

13:43.690 --> 13:46.860
His fifth HBO special,
"Kill the Messenger,"

13:46.860 --> 13:51.360
premiered on September 27th,
2008, and won him another Emmy

13:51.360 --> 13:54.603
for outstanding writing for
a variety or music program.

13:58.480 --> 14:02.440
Chris Rock also hosted the
77th Academy Awards ceremony

14:02.440 --> 14:04.490
in 2005.

14:04.490 --> 14:07.940
The decision to have Chris host
the awards was seen by some

14:07.940 --> 14:11.040
as a change to bring
some edge to the ceremony

14:11.040 --> 14:13.733
and make it more appealing
to younger audiences.

14:14.820 --> 14:17.980
The older Oscar officials
were reportedly displeased

14:17.980 --> 14:20.950
with Chris's performance,
as he chose to make jokes

14:20.950 --> 14:24.583
towards A-list actors before
turning the jokes on himself.

14:26.050 --> 14:28.897
- The controversy never
really affected me.

14:28.897 --> 14:30.853
I didn't really think about it.

14:31.940 --> 14:35.900
I don't know. It seemed
made up, put it that way.

14:35.900 --> 14:40.127
I tour the country, and I'm out

14:41.870 --> 14:45.730
across America more than most writers,

14:45.730 --> 14:48.570
as much as you guys, anyway,
and I'm in the whole country.

14:48.570 --> 14:52.790
So my fans are black and
white and gay and straight,

14:52.790 --> 14:56.580
and I didn't feel like there
was any controversy at all.

14:56.580 --> 14:57.766
- Part

14:57.766 --> 14:59.100
of this whole Oscar experience for you?

14:59.100 --> 15:01.143
- The hardest part.

15:04.790 --> 15:06.550
Just getting the material ready

15:06.550 --> 15:10.130
without the press putting every joke

15:10.130 --> 15:13.384
in a magazine or on the internet, yeah.

15:13.384 --> 15:14.800
- And also,
do I have a good luck charm?

15:14.800 --> 15:16.410
- Do I have a good luck charm?

15:16.410 --> 15:21.410
I keep my dad's picture and
close by, stuff like that, but.

15:22.350 --> 15:23.183
- 36.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.019
- 267.
- Stephanie for BET.

15:27.019 --> 15:28.499
- Hey, Stephanie.

15:28.499 --> 15:29.332
- what did you feel

15:29.332 --> 15:30.430
was your best line of the night,

15:30.430 --> 15:33.653
and how'd you feel seeing
all that color in the room?

15:35.090 --> 15:37.590
- What was my best line? I don't know.

15:37.590 --> 15:39.905
My jokes are like my children.

15:41.023 --> 15:44.293
I have no favorites,

15:45.320 --> 15:47.650
but I like the the Sean Penn comeback.

15:47.650 --> 15:50.780
I just like anytime you
can get something funny

15:50.780 --> 15:54.350
that we didn't have coming into the show,

15:54.350 --> 15:56.270
you take a little more pride in that.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.610
Always feels good to see
some color in the room

15:59.610 --> 16:02.717
that don't have mops, so it's good.

16:05.556 --> 16:06.389
- 267.

16:06.389 --> 16:07.960
- Chris, over here on your right.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.300
You had said before this that it's a room

16:10.300 --> 16:11.710
like any other room and that, in fact,

16:11.710 --> 16:14.420
you've played bigger arenas.

16:14.420 --> 16:15.380
- I have.
- But having been out there

16:15.380 --> 16:16.810
in front of them and been part of it,

16:16.810 --> 16:18.710
what is different about this audience?

16:19.721 --> 16:22.666
- What's different?

16:22.666 --> 16:23.820
You know what the only difference is?

16:23.820 --> 16:27.530
It's the lighting and the
dresses and all that stuff.

16:27.530 --> 16:29.850
When I play LA, it's almost like that,

16:29.850 --> 16:32.120
last time I played,
anyway, at the amphitheater.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.273
You get a lot of famous
people, and I don't know,

16:36.418 --> 16:38.630
it's TV, and you can't curse.

16:38.630 --> 16:39.770
The audience is an audience.

16:39.770 --> 16:42.560
It's just what you're allowed
to do to the audience,

16:42.560 --> 16:46.860
so there were some language restrictions

16:46.860 --> 16:51.510
that were placed on me,
but everything worked out,

16:51.510 --> 16:54.176
Five seconds before I went on air.

16:54.176 --> 16:56.730
- 10, okay.
- I don't know.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.870
You try to approach it like another show

17:00.870 --> 17:04.090
'cause the things that'll
make you suck doing this

17:04.090 --> 17:05.530
are the same things that'll make you suck

17:05.530 --> 17:07.470
when you do a normal concert.

17:07.470 --> 17:09.177
So you go there and you say,

17:09.177 --> 17:11.560
"Okay, I've been working
on this for a long time.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.077
I know my lines. Let's bring it."

17:15.590 --> 17:18.227
It's like you talk to
yourself next to yourself.

17:18.227 --> 17:21.050
"Hey, let's do, all right?"

17:21.050 --> 17:24.010
And you get up there.

17:25.770 --> 17:27.280
- It was not until the success

17:27.280 --> 17:29.660
of his standup in the late 1990s

17:29.660 --> 17:33.403
that Chris Rock began receiving
leading man status in films.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.320
He had made his onscreen
debut with supporting roles

17:37.320 --> 17:40.540
in previous films but went
on to star in films such

17:40.540 --> 17:44.843
as "Bad Company" in 2002 and
"The Longest Yard" in 2005.

17:46.330 --> 17:49.450
Chris also worked increasingly
behind the camera, too,

17:49.450 --> 17:53.090
as a writer and director
for "Head of State" in 2003

17:53.090 --> 17:55.633
and "I Think I Love My Wife" in 2007.

18:01.280 --> 18:05.020
2005 was a successful year for Chris Rock.

18:05.020 --> 18:07.170
He took on the part of Marty the zebra

18:07.170 --> 18:10.730
in the Dreamworks animated
film, "Madagascar."

18:10.730 --> 18:12.870
The plot follows a group of zoo animals

18:12.870 --> 18:15.100
who find themselves
washed up on the island

18:15.100 --> 18:18.573
of Madagascar after a series
of unfortunate events.

18:20.489 --> 18:22.144
- We've been ratted out, boys.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.100
- Good evening officers.

18:25.100 --> 18:28.430
- Now they're
being set way out of town.

18:31.130 --> 18:32.610
- Oh great. This is just great.

18:32.610 --> 18:34.900
- This could be the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

18:34.900 --> 18:38.860
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

18:38.860 --> 18:41.630
- His voice acting
was instantly recognizable,

18:41.630 --> 18:44.720
and he brought his own
comedy flare to the role.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.630
- You have to use your voice a lot,

18:46.630 --> 18:49.760
so sometimes you can like work too much

18:49.760 --> 18:52.210
and then you can't talk and
you get laryngitis and stuff

18:52.210 --> 18:55.182
like that, especially a
lot of the screaming stuff.

18:55.182 --> 18:57.870
You gotta scream over
and over and over again.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.380
Hey, what am I complaining for?

19:00.380 --> 19:02.850
- The film received
mixed reviews from critics

19:02.850 --> 19:05.310
but was a success at the box office

19:05.310 --> 19:08.463
and was one of the highest
grossing films of 2005.

19:09.530 --> 19:14.160
Also in 2005, UPN TV network
premiered a comedy series

19:14.160 --> 19:16.340
called "Everybody Hates Chris,"

19:16.340 --> 19:19.200
loosely based on Chris Rock's school days.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.880
He was the executive
producer and narrator.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.160
- Show is like a "Wonder Year."

19:24.160 --> 19:26.300
It's like a "Malcolm X in the Middle."

19:26.300 --> 19:28.367
- And you're narrating?
- Yes.

19:28.367 --> 19:30.990
- "Everybody Hates
Chris" was a parody take

19:30.990 --> 19:34.520
of the popular sitcom series
"Everybody Loves Raymond."

19:34.520 --> 19:37.290
- Hey, you need a VCR?
- I got one already.

19:37.290 --> 19:38.710
- Fell off the truck this morning.

19:38.710 --> 19:40.780
- Really? I'll take two.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.120
- I never realized
the only stuff that sold

19:43.120 --> 19:46.140
on the street in my
neighborhood was stolen stuff.

19:46.140 --> 19:48.320
- Cookies! Cookies for sale.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.907
Chocolate chip! Peanut butter Do Si Do!

19:49.907 --> 19:52.690
Chocolate mint?
- I got cookies.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.461
- They just fell off
the truck this morning.

19:56.350 --> 19:59.187
- Why didn't you say
so? Give me two boxes!

20:00.150 --> 20:01.830
- The show
garnered both critical

20:01.830 --> 20:03.620
and ratings success.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.350
The series was nominated for
a Golden Globe Award in 2006

20:07.350 --> 20:10.400
for best TV series, musical, or comedy

20:10.400 --> 20:12.170
and also received nominations

20:12.170 --> 20:15.313
for People's Choice awards
and two Emmy awards.

20:16.600 --> 20:20.187
In 200, due to the
popularity of the first film,

20:20.187 --> 20:23.940
"Madagascar 2: Escape
to Africa" was released

20:23.940 --> 20:26.453
with Chris reprising his role as Marty.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.830
- New Madagascar.
- What can we expect?

20:29.830 --> 20:32.520
'Cause I'm excited.
- So good, best "Madagascar."

20:32.520 --> 20:35.160
I'm not making that up.
It's the best "Madagascar."

20:35.160 --> 20:39.638
It looks amazing. We buy a circus.

20:39.638 --> 20:41.480
We join a Russian circus.

20:41.480 --> 20:44.130
When you see it, you're not
gonna believe how good it looks.

20:44.130 --> 20:46.480
It's like a David LaChapelle portrait

20:46.480 --> 20:48.470
or something like, you know what I mean?

20:48.470 --> 20:51.420
Like Salvador Dalí did it
or something. It's amazing.

20:51.420 --> 20:53.890
- Well, I think we got
a better movie this time

20:53.890 --> 20:55.097
than the last, and
that's saying something.

20:55.097 --> 20:58.630
The last one was pretty great,
but the cast is all back,

20:58.630 --> 21:02.270
we've got some new people
in it and it's a lot of fun.

21:02.270 --> 21:03.620
Great for the whole family.

21:03.620 --> 21:04.550
- Now, how
does the whole team work?

21:04.550 --> 21:06.410
Do the actors get more
involved in the parts-

21:06.410 --> 21:09.530
- Well, they do 'cause now they
know the characters so well,

21:09.530 --> 21:14.530
and I think Ben and Chris had
some great chemistry going,

21:14.980 --> 21:17.570
and they got into the studio
together a little bit this time

21:17.570 --> 21:18.733
which is unusual.

21:20.079 --> 21:20.950
They did great work.

21:20.950 --> 21:22.190
- Do you
think it gets bigger

21:22.190 --> 21:23.915
and better an experience?

21:23.915 --> 21:24.860
- Yeah, sometimes.

21:24.860 --> 21:27.920
The right scenes, they can
really play off of one another

21:27.920 --> 21:30.390
now that they know the characters so well.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.930
- Me and Ben actually recorded some

21:31.930 --> 21:34.290
of it together, which was pretty cool.

21:34.290 --> 21:37.090
So when you get to work
with another comedian,

21:37.090 --> 21:37.923
it's always good.

21:37.923 --> 21:40.540
- Yeah, we did that one
day, which was really fun

21:40.540 --> 21:42.760
'cause he's so good, and
to see him improvise,

21:42.760 --> 21:45.600
it was very inspiring and
a little bit intimidating

21:45.600 --> 21:47.110
'cause he comes up with
a lot of funny lines.

21:47.110 --> 21:48.830
His ratio of funny lines
that he comes up with

21:48.830 --> 21:50.700
is much more than mine.

21:50.700 --> 21:51.870
- Have a lot people said

21:51.870 --> 21:53.870
that the second one is
better than the first one.

21:53.870 --> 21:55.510
- It's a lot better than the first one,

21:55.510 --> 21:58.150
and it's not like the first one was bad.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.700
I don't know.

21:59.700 --> 22:02.413
Scripts are a little
tighter, less guesswork.

22:03.250 --> 22:04.830
- The film mostly continues on

22:04.830 --> 22:06.300
from the first installment,

22:06.300 --> 22:09.260
following the same characters
that audiences love.

22:09.260 --> 22:11.783
The franchise was a family favorite.

22:13.520 --> 22:17.070
- Well, we make these films
for ourselves to make us laugh,

22:17.070 --> 22:19.270
and we're probably
pretty juvenile at heart.

22:20.400 --> 22:24.400
But the goal is so parents
can take their kids to a movie

22:24.400 --> 22:26.550
and not be bored and
wait for it to be done

22:26.550 --> 22:27.560
so they can take the kids home,

22:27.560 --> 22:29.700
but everyone can go and enjoy it together.

22:29.700 --> 22:32.710
That's always the goal
with "Madagascar" movies.

22:32.710 --> 22:35.150
- Now, as
far as the cast, normally,

22:35.150 --> 22:37.290
they just go into the
studio and read their lines.

22:37.290 --> 22:39.358
I hear that they have a bit
more involvement this time.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.890
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- How does that work?

22:40.890 --> 22:42.710
- Well, that's what's great
about working with these guys.

22:42.710 --> 22:44.900
They are incredible comedians, actors,

22:44.900 --> 22:48.180
improvisers, even filmmakers, directors.

22:48.180 --> 22:50.960
And so to collaborate with these guys,

22:50.960 --> 22:52.730
which is really what we do when we're

22:52.730 --> 22:54.260
in the recording studio with them,

22:54.260 --> 22:58.110
is just a great opportunity
to make the movie better.

22:58.110 --> 22:59.820
And you get Sasha Baron Cohen in a room,

22:59.820 --> 23:02.310
and he starts improvising
in front of the microphone.

23:02.310 --> 23:04.510
Ben Stiller and Chris
Rock we brought together

23:04.510 --> 23:06.020
so they could play off one another

23:06.020 --> 23:08.520
and work off the page
and go beyond the page,

23:08.520 --> 23:11.990
and so it's just better for
the film all the way around.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.510
- We have the best
seats in the house, too,

23:13.510 --> 23:15.200
when it comes to these comedians.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.130
We're sitting in the booth
just cracking up most

23:17.130 --> 23:17.963
of the time.

23:18.930 --> 23:22.510
- They're a whole lot of
fun, and it's for the kids.

23:22.510 --> 23:23.630
- Yeah.
- How about both?

23:23.630 --> 23:25.367
- It is both, actually, isn't it?

23:25.367 --> 23:26.843
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's a lot of fun.

23:27.698 --> 23:31.100
- It's fun to do something that
you are a part of the whole

23:31.100 --> 23:32.120
- You're part of a
- process.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.690
- winning team.
- Yeah.

23:33.690 --> 23:36.580
- It was released
on November 7th, 2008

23:36.580 --> 23:39.899
and was the sixth-highest
grossing film of that year.

23:42.450 --> 23:46.050
In 2010, Chris Rock starred
in "Death at a Funeral,"

23:46.050 --> 23:49.830
a comedy about a funeral ceremony
that turns into a debacle

23:49.830 --> 23:53.330
of exposed family secrets
and misplaced bodies.

23:53.330 --> 23:54.910
- So sorry to hear about your dad.

23:54.910 --> 23:57.330
- Were you guys friends?
- Something like that.

23:57.330 --> 23:59.630
- You're telling me our
father was on the down low?

23:59.630 --> 24:00.463
- Way down.

24:00.463 --> 24:02.800
Now the guy wants $30,000 or he's

24:02.800 --> 24:05.300
gonna start showing pictures
of them doing stuff.

24:05.300 --> 24:07.520
- Nah, nah, I don't believe that.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.170
- Oh! Daddy!

24:10.170 --> 24:11.300
- The film is a remake

24:11.300 --> 24:14.480
of a 2007 British film of the same name.

24:14.480 --> 24:15.393
- It was a British
film to start with,

24:15.393 --> 24:18.370
and so how did you change
it for the American cast

24:18.370 --> 24:19.540
and for American audiences?

24:19.540 --> 24:21.450
- We don't talk about tea as much.

24:21.450 --> 24:25.293
We took out all mention of
darts. Nobody says pavement.

24:27.040 --> 24:30.330
- Making the film and
changing it for the Americans,

24:30.330 --> 24:32.760
did you think it made it
more obvious the differences

24:32.760 --> 24:34.450
between British and American humor?

24:34.450 --> 24:35.940
- It's weird.

24:35.940 --> 24:38.040
Me personally, I don't
find a big difference

24:38.040 --> 24:40.460
between British and American humor.

24:40.460 --> 24:44.210
When I was over here doing
on tour as a standup,

24:44.210 --> 24:46.790
I didn't really have to change anything.

24:46.790 --> 24:48.400
I thought everybody got everything.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.010
- 'Cause some people say that Americans

24:50.010 --> 24:51.790
are slightly more crude than the English.

24:51.790 --> 24:52.623
Do you think that's fair?
- Americans

24:52.623 --> 24:54.113
are slightly more crude than the.

24:55.030 --> 24:55.863
the English.

24:55.863 --> 24:58.603
The English are more literate people.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.550
You guys read a little more.

25:01.550 --> 25:04.450
- Yeah, and we don't
talk about toilet humor

25:04.450 --> 25:05.283
in quite the same way,

25:05.283 --> 25:07.940
I don't think maybe.
- Not quite the same way, no.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.020
- It is totally over the top,

25:09.020 --> 25:11.240
but it does show that all families,

25:11.240 --> 25:12.963
most families are completely
bonkers, aren't they?

25:12.963 --> 25:14.050
- Yes!
- So everyone

25:14.050 --> 25:15.540
can relate to something in it.

25:15.540 --> 25:18.220
- Yes, you will see your
family in this funeral.

25:18.220 --> 25:19.740
It's a family movie, actually.

25:19.740 --> 25:22.450
It's so weird that it is, but it is.

25:22.450 --> 25:24.160
It's a movie for the whole family.

25:24.160 --> 25:27.200
- Who would have thought
funerals would be so funny?

25:27.200 --> 25:29.970
- Funerals are hysterical.

25:29.970 --> 25:32.463
Don't you always find yourself
giggling at a funeral?

25:32.463 --> 25:34.130
- Do you?
- It was difficult.

25:34.130 --> 25:36.590
It was difficult, especially
like when you're around a guy

25:36.590 --> 25:41.030
like Tracy Morgan that it's
not really a big difference

25:41.030 --> 25:43.390
between what he does on the
screen and off the screen,

25:43.390 --> 25:46.990
and he's always funny, so
yeah, it was really hard.

25:46.990 --> 25:49.010
- When you have
that level of comedians,

25:49.010 --> 25:50.297
is there a rivalry between you?

25:50.297 --> 25:52.960
Do you say, "Oh, you had
more jokes in your scene"?

25:52.960 --> 25:54.820
- No, we don't really have rivalry.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.990
Now when we were younger,
there was a rivalry.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.970
Now we're just glad to be working.

25:59.970 --> 26:03.090
We've seen so many guys fall off.

26:03.090 --> 26:04.715
We're like, "Ooh."

26:05.867 --> 26:06.960
- "Death at a Funeral"

26:06.960 --> 26:09.903
received mostly positive
reviews on critic sites.

26:13.550 --> 26:16.430
2010 saw an appearance
in the film "Grown Ups"

26:16.430 --> 26:18.763
alongside his friend, Adam Sandler.

26:20.150 --> 26:21.070
- Guys, congratulations,

26:21.070 --> 26:22.590
first of all, on the movie.

26:22.590 --> 26:23.423
- Yeah!
- I laughed my head off

26:23.423 --> 26:24.256
when I saw it last week.

26:24.256 --> 26:25.089
It was brilliant.
- Okay.

26:25.089 --> 26:25.922
- Really, really good fun.

26:25.922 --> 26:27.400
I imagine for you, it
was a very tough call

26:27.400 --> 26:29.170
of whether to be involved in this film,

26:29.170 --> 26:32.560
hanging out for the summer,
sunshine with your friends.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.710
What was that call like
when Adam calls you

26:34.710 --> 26:37.370
and says, "Come and be a part of this"?

26:37.370 --> 26:38.673
- I thought he was lying.

26:40.550 --> 26:43.870
- He does that to me,
teases me every six months,

26:43.870 --> 26:45.708
offers me a movie, and then goes, "Psych!"

26:47.577 --> 26:48.704
- "Hey, you wanna be in 'Click'?"

26:48.704 --> 26:49.798
Nah.
- Nah.

26:49.798 --> 26:50.807
"What you doing?" "Nothing."

26:50.807 --> 26:52.427
"Ooh, you're not working, are you?"

26:52.427 --> 26:53.540
"No, not working at all."

26:53.540 --> 26:55.960
- I felt by saying no to all
the other movies he asked me

26:55.960 --> 26:57.170
that
- You had to do this.

26:57.170 --> 27:00.160
- I felt stupid. Now it's
starting to get weird.

27:00.160 --> 27:00.993
- Was it good fun on the set

27:00.993 --> 27:02.147
'cause all your families were
there as well, weren't they?

27:02.147 --> 27:04.420
Your children and-
- Yes, yes, absolutely.

27:04.420 --> 27:06.900
We had a great time
with everybody's family.

27:06.900 --> 27:08.600
All the kids got to know
each other pretty good.

27:08.600 --> 27:11.474
David, we kept him off meth
for two months straight.

27:11.474 --> 27:12.865
- Two months.
- It was fun to see that.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.660
- Then I was right back.
- That's good. That's fine.

27:15.660 --> 27:18.530
I knew you'd-
- It was a good fun thing

27:18.530 --> 27:20.280
'cause you keep the trailers together.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.899
So it's still work. It's still hard.

27:21.899 --> 27:25.400
You have to get up at five,
but it was nice to know people

27:25.400 --> 27:27.010
around there to make the
days go a little quicker.

27:27.010 --> 27:28.560
You always had someone to talk to.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.260
Selma was there. These guys were there.

27:30.260 --> 27:31.184
If they're working, then-

27:31.184 --> 27:33.101
- It was like a summer
camp for overpaid actors.

27:34.510 --> 27:35.982
- Sounds good fun to be a part of.

27:35.982 --> 27:37.437
And with so many comedians on set,

27:37.437 --> 27:38.850
do you have moments where you're trying

27:38.850 --> 27:41.320
to outdo each other's jokes
so you can be the funniest?

27:41.320 --> 27:42.725
- Yes.
- Have competitions?

27:42.725 --> 27:45.740
- Except Adam's 'cause he'll cut you out.

27:45.740 --> 27:47.680
- Or take what you said.
- Or take what you said.

27:47.680 --> 27:48.790
- Let's do it one more time

27:48.790 --> 27:50.185
where I say what Rock just says.

27:51.018 --> 27:52.729
- Let's try one that way.
- Exactly.

27:52.729 --> 27:53.562
- Makes more sense to the story.

27:53.562 --> 27:54.469
- We'll see what it looks like.

28:01.050 --> 28:03.730
- In 2011, Chris
Rock appeared on Broadway

28:03.730 --> 28:06.280
in the play "The Mother
with the Hat,"

28:06.280 --> 28:09.200
which saw him nominated for
a Drama League award based

28:09.200 --> 28:10.970
on his performance.

28:10.970 --> 28:13.310
In an interview with "Vibe" Magazine,

28:13.310 --> 28:15.560
Chris stated that he chose to do Broadway

28:15.560 --> 28:19.309
because he wanted more
people to see him really act.

28:19.309 --> 28:21.327
- What's it like
being on Broadway? Come on.

28:21.327 --> 28:22.210
- It's nice.

28:22.210 --> 28:26.312
It's like being on 29th
Street, but it's Broadway.

28:26.312 --> 28:28.480
- What is it like
to be honored by the Tonys,

28:28.480 --> 28:30.160
all these nominations?

28:30.160 --> 28:32.320
- Hey, man, it's a good play.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.421
The most important thing
is that people like it.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.810
- Then in
2012, Chris Rock starred

28:40.810 --> 28:44.800
in "Two Days in New York"
alongside actress Julie Delpy,

28:44.800 --> 28:48.160
which was a sequel to her
film, "Two Days in Paris."

28:48.160 --> 28:49.980
- Me, I play a guy named Mingus.

28:49.980 --> 28:53.580
I'm a writer, a columnist, a disc jockey.

28:53.580 --> 28:58.580
I live with the lovely Julie
Delpy, my French woman,

28:59.860 --> 29:03.760
and my in-laws are coming for the week,

29:03.760 --> 29:05.940
and then hilarity ensues.

29:05.940 --> 29:06.773
There you go.

29:06.773 --> 29:07.925
- I said I wasn't gonna get mad.

29:07.925 --> 29:08.758
- What the heck's

29:08.758 --> 29:09.591
going on with you?
- Okay, you know what?

29:09.591 --> 29:10.424
- Ever since your family got here,

29:10.424 --> 29:11.522
you've become another person.

29:12.355 --> 29:14.200
- Mingus family!

29:14.200 --> 29:15.490
- You gotta kiss him, or he gets mad.

29:15.490 --> 29:16.987
That's my mother. No tongue.

29:22.075 --> 29:23.320
- Has your dad ever keyed a car?

29:23.320 --> 29:24.262
- Of course not.

29:25.740 --> 29:27.130
- Well, there's gonna be an
angry limo driver outside

29:27.130 --> 29:29.780
that wants to press charges.
- Well that's a, really?

29:29.780 --> 29:31.893
- The character was better written,

29:32.990 --> 29:35.700
even than the movies I write for myself.

29:35.700 --> 29:37.710
I learned a lot, like, "Oh, okay."

29:37.710 --> 29:39.273
The character's a real person,

29:40.180 --> 29:42.920
a real grownup who's been married

29:42.920 --> 29:44.947
and divorced and has children,

29:44.947 --> 29:46.890
and so it was fun to play a grownup.

29:46.890 --> 29:47.850
- It's very funny.

29:47.850 --> 29:49.920
I think the film is not like indie

29:49.920 --> 29:52.660
in a sense of hard to get into.

29:52.660 --> 29:55.500
The jokes are very straightforward,
you know what I mean?

29:55.500 --> 29:56.870
It could be a broader comedy.

29:56.870 --> 30:00.110
It just happens to be an indie comedy

30:00.110 --> 30:02.320
because of this financial setup,

30:02.320 --> 30:06.630
but it's actually not not
funny, you know what I mean?

30:06.630 --> 30:08.470
The whole film is comedy

30:08.470 --> 30:09.520
from beginning to end.
- It's really funny.

30:09.520 --> 30:12.255
It's so much funnier than "The Avengers."

30:15.057 --> 30:16.887
- It's funnier than "Battleship."

30:17.830 --> 30:18.663
- Rihanna's asked that.

30:18.663 --> 30:20.266
- I'm not sure about that, yeah.

30:20.266 --> 30:21.218
- You sure?
- Yeah.

30:21.218 --> 30:22.051
- Oh, Rihanna's asked.
- I'm not sure

30:22.051 --> 30:22.997
- Is her ass in "Battleship"?
- "Battleship" .

30:22.997 --> 30:23.830
- No, they don't.
It's .

30:23.830 --> 30:25.782
- Oh, see? They couldn't blow that up.

30:27.980 --> 30:29.510
It worked. It worked.

30:29.510 --> 30:32.520
I had a good time. She was good.

30:32.520 --> 30:37.410
She had to give me a
little extra, whatever,

30:37.410 --> 30:39.950
attention 'cause I
didn't speak any French,

30:39.950 --> 30:41.703
so she had to explain a lot to me.

30:43.366 --> 30:44.300
- Was it funny working with her

30:44.300 --> 30:45.380
and her dad on the set?

30:45.380 --> 30:47.750
- Yeah, yeah 'cause they
would have real fights,

30:47.750 --> 30:50.507
like real father-daughter
fights in French,

30:50.507 --> 30:51.654
so that was fun to watch.

30:51.654 --> 30:52.970
- And what do you
want audiences to take away?

30:52.970 --> 30:56.863
- I just want audiences to
realize this is a comedy.

30:56.863 --> 30:58.620
A lot of people, it's like,
"Ugh, you're in an art movie."

30:58.620 --> 31:00.080
I'm like, "Yeah, I
guess you can say that,"

31:00.080 --> 31:01.270
but it's really funny.

31:01.270 --> 31:04.000
It's funnier than you think, so.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.074
- Thanks, Chris.
- Take care.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.610
- In this year, he also starred

31:12.610 --> 31:15.367
in the third film in the
"Madagascar" franchise,

31:15.367 --> 31:18.227
"Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted."

31:19.880 --> 31:21.330
- I think Alex has sort of
been trying to figure out

31:21.330 --> 31:23.730
through all the movies, and he, again,

31:23.730 --> 31:24.860
gets in this situation with Gia

31:24.860 --> 31:27.730
where he's saying he's
something that he isn't

31:27.730 --> 31:29.280
or someone that he isn't.

31:29.280 --> 31:32.990
And I feel like the the theme of the films

31:32.990 --> 31:35.300
is really about finding out, for Alex,

31:35.300 --> 31:36.900
finding out who he is
and also the friendship

31:36.900 --> 31:39.210
of everybody there being
there for each other.

31:39.210 --> 31:41.050
And when we finally get to New York,

31:41.050 --> 31:43.570
we realize that we're not the
people who we thought we were,

31:43.570 --> 31:46.870
and then we get trapped in the zoo again.

31:46.870 --> 31:48.660
And there's something, I guess,

31:48.660 --> 31:52.150
in the story about how we're
always there for each other,

31:52.150 --> 31:56.140
and that, to me, is the
thing that Alex gets

31:56.140 --> 31:57.770
is that his friends are there for him.

31:57.770 --> 31:59.370
He's there for his friends, and.

32:01.140 --> 32:03.140
- Just like the
others in the franchise,

32:03.140 --> 32:05.493
the film did really
well at the box office,

32:06.440 --> 32:11.410
as it was the eighth top
grossing film in 2012.

32:11.410 --> 32:12.300
- They enjoy the movies,

32:12.300 --> 32:14.132
but it's really fun to have that to share

32:14.132 --> 32:15.090
with them.
- Oh, it's amazing.

32:15.090 --> 32:18.700
The first movie I ever took
my youngest daughter Zahra

32:18.700 --> 32:23.700
to see was "Madagascar
2," I believe, no, one.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
And I remember we watched
it at the Dreamworks campus,

32:30.730 --> 32:34.640
and she turns to me and
goes, "Daddy, is that you?"

32:35.473 --> 32:39.590
And it was just such a great day.

32:39.590 --> 32:44.590
The script's great, but as a director,

32:44.860 --> 32:47.700
I always like people that are too big

32:49.050 --> 32:51.640
'cause it's so much easier to get 'em down

32:51.640 --> 32:55.180
than to get somebody who is too small up.

32:55.180 --> 32:57.500
That's like, oh, that's
the most frustrating thing

32:57.500 --> 32:58.690
in the world.

32:58.690 --> 33:02.590
So I improv all the freaking time

33:02.590 --> 33:05.207
until they tell me to stop, and they go,

33:05.207 --> 33:07.970
"Okay, we gotta get this line.

33:07.970 --> 33:09.861
You gotta say circus."

33:10.694 --> 33:13.073
And I make sure, after a lot of improvs,

33:13.073 --> 33:15.973
that I see exactly what they
want me to say, but I try to.

33:17.227 --> 33:20.520
- "Grown Ups" also
got a sequel, "Grown Ups 2,"

33:20.520 --> 33:22.690
which premiered in 2013.

33:22.690 --> 33:25.080
The film received some
negative reviews compared

33:25.080 --> 33:26.823
to the first in the franchise.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.090
In 2014, Chris filed for divorce

33:35.090 --> 33:37.860
from his wife Malaak Compton Rock.

33:37.860 --> 33:40.240
Chris admitted to
infidelity in the marriage

33:40.240 --> 33:42.140
as well as addiction issues.

33:42.140 --> 33:46.313
Their divorce was finalized
on August 22nd, 2016.

33:50.040 --> 33:52.740
On October 21st, 2015,

33:52.740 --> 33:55.670
the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences

33:55.670 --> 33:59.143
announced Rock would host
the 88th Academy Awards.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.630
When the subsequent acting
nominations turned out

34:02.630 --> 34:06.100
to include no racial minorities,
Chris was called upon

34:06.100 --> 34:08.380
to join a boycott of the ceremony.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.870
However, he declined,
stating at the ceremony

34:11.870 --> 34:14.140
that it would have accomplished
little since the show

34:14.140 --> 34:17.620
would have proceeded anyway
with him simply replaced.

34:17.620 --> 34:21.717
- No black nominees, and people are like,

34:21.717 --> 34:23.110
"Chris, you should boycott.

34:23.110 --> 34:25.500
Chris, you should quit. You should quit."

34:25.500 --> 34:27.773
How come it's only unemployed people

34:27.773 --> 34:29.566
that tell you to quit something, huh?

34:35.034 --> 34:37.060
No one with a job ever tells you to quit.

34:37.060 --> 34:39.410
So I thought about quitting.

34:39.410 --> 34:41.470
I thought about it real hard,

34:41.470 --> 34:44.080
but I realized they're gonna
have the Oscars anyway.

34:44.080 --> 34:47.140
They're not gonna cancel
the Oscars because I quit.

34:47.140 --> 34:49.740
And the last thing I need is

34:49.740 --> 34:52.150
to lose another job to Kevin Hart, okay?

34:53.590 --> 34:56.390
Instead, Rock spoke of his
concerns about the lack

34:56.390 --> 35:00.220
of diversity in AMPAS at
various times during the show,

35:00.220 --> 35:03.057
closing by saying, "Black lives matter."

35:04.570 --> 35:06.810
- I don't know. Chris
got his message across.

35:06.810 --> 35:07.730
It was all good.

35:07.730 --> 35:10.220
Everybody understood what he was saying

35:10.220 --> 35:12.720
and how he was saying it, and it was fun.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.417
- And what more
do you want the Academy

35:14.417 --> 35:16.040
and the industry to do about diversity?

35:16.040 --> 35:19.120
- I don't think the
Academy can do any more.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.970
Let's see what everybody's talking about

35:20.970 --> 35:23.800
in a month and a half, see if
it's still in the zeitgeist,

35:23.800 --> 35:26.100
and then we'll know if
we have something there.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.230
If nobody's talking about it in a month,

35:28.230 --> 35:31.020
I'll see you here next year,
talking the the same stuff.

35:31.020 --> 35:32.950
- 'Cause it's more about
the industry making a stand

35:32.950 --> 35:33.783
than the Academy.

35:33.783 --> 35:35.380
It's gotta come from
the bottom, hasn't it?

35:35.380 --> 35:38.350
- Well, it has to come
from the people who cast,

35:38.350 --> 35:40.330
and it's not just casting black actors.

35:40.330 --> 35:42.763
It's Asian actors and Hispanic actors.

35:43.668 --> 35:45.220
It's not just one thing.

35:45.220 --> 35:46.810
It's that a change has to happen,

35:46.810 --> 35:49.523
and it either will or it won't.

35:50.870 --> 35:52.226
We'll see.
- So much, thank you.

35:53.540 --> 35:56.350
Now generally, his
discussions about diversity,

35:56.350 --> 35:58.673
do you think it went
down well in the hold?

35:59.670 --> 36:02.310
- It's very complex in
the middle of a ceremony

36:02.310 --> 36:04.843
that is a celebration
that is not a meeting,

36:07.334 --> 36:08.780
to do what he has done.

36:08.780 --> 36:11.050
He didn't have it easy here.

36:11.050 --> 36:13.150
He's being spicy in some moments.

36:13.150 --> 36:14.330
He be kicking around.

36:14.330 --> 36:16.190
Some people have maybe
hurt by what he said

36:16.190 --> 36:17.790
and put the finger in the wound.

36:17.790 --> 36:19.400
Eventually, he made us laugh eventually.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.207
Sometimes everybody was like,

36:21.207 --> 36:23.730
"Oh my God, is he going too far?"

36:23.730 --> 36:26.910
But in the overall, I think
it's all very well situation.

36:26.910 --> 36:30.410
It was not easy, yeah.

36:30.410 --> 36:31.481
- Thank you. Enjoy your evening.

36:31.481 --> 36:32.481
- Thank you.

36:38.330 --> 36:41.230
During the years 2015 to 2018,

36:41.230 --> 36:43.320
Chris Rock made many different appearances

36:43.320 --> 36:45.460
and television shows as himself,

36:45.460 --> 36:48.160
not really starring in
anything in particular.

36:48.160 --> 36:51.010
He was taking a break from the spotlight.

36:51.010 --> 36:54.360
On October 30th, 2016,
Netflix announced they

36:54.360 --> 36:57.010
would be releasing two new
standup comedy specials

36:57.010 --> 36:58.180
from Chris Rock.

36:58.180 --> 37:00.910
The first special,
"Chris Rock: Tambourine,"

37:00.910 --> 37:05.840
was released on Netflix
on February 14th, 2018.

37:05.840 --> 37:09.110
The specials marked the
comedian's first concert specials

37:09.110 --> 37:10.763
released in 10 years.

37:13.170 --> 37:16.660
Then in 2018, Chris Rock
start in "The Week Of"

37:16.660 --> 37:19.812
alongside longtime friend, Adam Sandler.

37:21.251 --> 37:23.018
- Got a big one, Dr. C?

37:23.018 --> 37:25.354
- Another day, another life.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.250
Hello?
- Father of the groom!

37:28.250 --> 37:29.203
You got a sec?

37:30.850 --> 37:31.683
- Yeah.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.767
Its gotta be a decent hotel, like a-

37:33.767 --> 37:35.441
- Oh, I thought we talked about this.

37:35.441 --> 37:37.614
I told you we can handle it,
- It's just that we

37:37.614 --> 37:38.447
, pal.
- Let me get the phone.

37:38.447 --> 37:39.940
- Dr.
Cordice, I got The Plaza.

37:39.940 --> 37:42.660
- We can cancel that.
Thanks for all your help.

37:44.005 --> 37:45.927
- I don't sound like that!

37:45.927 --> 37:47.720
- You do a little.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.260
- The movie was made as part

37:49.260 --> 37:51.623
of Adam Sandler's deal with Netflix.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.260
The film was about two fathers

37:54.260 --> 37:56.750
with opposing personalities
coming together

37:56.750 --> 37:58.900
to celebrate the wedding
of their children.

38:00.060 --> 38:03.430
- It's an amazing comedy about
two families coming together,

38:03.430 --> 38:05.560
a father trying to pay
for his daughter's wedding

38:05.560 --> 38:10.560
without any help, and the lengths he'll go

38:10.670 --> 38:12.700
to pay for it all by
himself without the help

38:12.700 --> 38:15.500
of Chris Rock's character,
the groom's father.

38:15.500 --> 38:19.390
And it explorers family relationships,

38:19.390 --> 38:21.840
two wildly different
families are coming together

38:21.840 --> 38:23.740
and meshing together so beautifully,

38:23.740 --> 38:27.020
and also the dynamics of a
father-daughter relationship

38:27.020 --> 38:29.410
and how loving that is and
what's really important

38:29.410 --> 38:32.583
at the end of the day, which
I don't think is money at all,

38:32.583 --> 38:34.500
so.
- Oh, okay, awesome.

38:35.509 --> 38:37.950
- I'm gonna be honest. The
anticipation was worse.

38:37.950 --> 38:40.340
When I met them, they're
all so down to earth,

38:40.340 --> 38:41.600
really, really funny.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.530
Adam and I would sing a
lot on a set together.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.050
He's a musical theater fan,

38:45.050 --> 38:47.510
and I started my career on Broadway.

38:47.510 --> 38:49.480
Steve Buscemi taught me so many lessons.

38:49.480 --> 38:51.290
He's such a grounding presence.

38:51.290 --> 38:54.550
Chris Rock is so elegant,
comical, always telling jokes.

38:54.550 --> 38:58.120
Rachel Dratch is beautiful, kind.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.770
- He brings the most comedy genius.

38:59.770 --> 39:02.100
It's his movie. I'm there.

39:02.100 --> 39:06.103
I'm just helping out,
setting picks.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.990
Adam's the lead. I play tambourine.

39:09.990 --> 39:12.230
I play a mean tambourine, though.

39:12.230 --> 39:13.926
I get a solo and everything.

39:15.480 --> 39:19.500
- Of course, you just get
jittery here a couple of days

39:19.500 --> 39:22.830
before it comes out, but we like it.

39:22.830 --> 39:23.663
We like it.

39:23.663 --> 39:26.696
Hopefully, people connect with
it and that's why you do it.

39:28.190 --> 39:30.010
- The film
received mixed reviews

39:30.010 --> 39:32.960
and didn't make it up there
with some of Chris's best work.

39:34.660 --> 39:38.370
In 2019, Chris Rock starred
in "Dolemite is My Name"

39:38.370 --> 39:42.720
alongside former mentor and
longtime friend, Eddie Murphy.

39:42.720 --> 39:44.770
- Uniquely inspirational story.

39:44.770 --> 39:47.740
There's nobody else like him.
Nobody else did it like him.

39:47.740 --> 39:50.990
This one came together when
I was finished resting.

39:50.990 --> 39:51.890
This was came together,

39:51.890 --> 39:54.910
and that's why we wound up doing it.

39:54.910 --> 39:57.210
- We've got a little secret weapon

39:57.210 --> 39:58.530
that's suddenly gonna be unleashed,

39:58.530 --> 40:01.730
in that weapon is a big, ol' missile

40:01.730 --> 40:03.740
of excitement called Rudy Ray Moore.

40:03.740 --> 40:05.850
I think everybody that sees the movie,

40:05.850 --> 40:08.020
they get excited about his story,

40:08.020 --> 40:09.970
and I think it's just extra special

40:09.970 --> 40:12.300
because it's Eddie
Murphy telling his story.

40:12.300 --> 40:14.473
Everyday was a joy to come to work.

40:15.540 --> 40:16.930
Everybody wanted to be there.

40:16.930 --> 40:20.920
They all felt this purpose
to tell this story.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.640
But also, I think it was just
you get that many funny people

40:23.640 --> 40:26.190
together that have been doing
the comedy circuit that long.

40:26.190 --> 40:28.210
They're gonna be talking
about old stories,

40:28.210 --> 40:29.580
talking about people in clubs

40:29.580 --> 40:32.020
that they remember back in the day.

40:32.020 --> 40:34.340
- The film
surrounds the real life legend,

40:34.340 --> 40:37.960
Rudy Ray Moore, a comedy and rap pioneer.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.120
The film received positive reviews

40:40.120 --> 40:41.993
and was praised by critics.

40:44.600 --> 40:47.830
In 2020, Chris voiced a
character and was the narrator

40:47.830 --> 40:51.080
in the remake of the
classic film "The Witches."

40:51.080 --> 40:53.420
The film was a success at the box office

40:53.420 --> 40:55.293
and was praised for its remake.

40:56.650 --> 41:00.360
2020 also saw a change in
characteristic for Chris Rock

41:00.360 --> 41:04.210
as he took on a more serious
role in season four of "Fargo."

41:04.210 --> 41:07.840
He plays Loy Cannon, a
Kansas city crime boss,

41:07.840 --> 41:10.090
a more serious role than he's used to

41:10.090 --> 41:13.233
but still manages to give
a stellar performance.

41:15.210 --> 41:16.677
- You sure about this?

41:20.300 --> 41:21.879
You remember what happened to the Irish?

41:26.250 --> 41:27.913
- Italians, they're the past.

41:29.330 --> 41:33.727
We're the future. They
just don't know it yet.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.840
- We're the goddamn Roman Empire.

41:38.770 --> 41:39.760
- Critics praised him

41:39.760 --> 41:41.810
for playing against his normal type,

41:41.810 --> 41:43.590
and he is tipped to win an Emmy award

41:43.590 --> 41:45.475
for his performance in the series.

41:47.780 --> 41:51.760
On September 18th, 2020,
Chris publicly revealed

41:51.760 --> 41:53.100
that he has been diagnosed

41:53.100 --> 41:55.410
with a nonverbal learning disorder,

41:55.410 --> 41:58.233
something he wants to raise
awareness for in the future.

41:59.750 --> 42:03.490
In October, 2020, Chris returned
to "Saturday Night Live"

42:03.490 --> 42:05.530
to host a show once again.

42:05.530 --> 42:08.200
Fans were happy to see
him back on their screens

42:08.200 --> 42:10.550
with another set of topical jokes relevant

42:10.550 --> 42:12.440
to today's society.

42:12.440 --> 42:15.043
- The world is insane right now,

42:15.938 --> 42:20.938
but one thing we can agree upon,
COVID has ruined our plans.

42:21.040 --> 42:24.260
We all used to have plans before COVID.

42:24.260 --> 42:25.640
Remember you used to
be able to plan stuff?

42:25.640 --> 42:29.670
Man, my sister was getting
married, man, getting.

42:29.670 --> 42:33.200
I paid Bell Biv DeVoe $80,000, man,

42:34.033 --> 42:35.323
and I can't get it back.

42:37.050 --> 42:39.263
I had tickets to Coachella, man.

42:40.270 --> 42:43.250
I know 200,000 Americans are dead,

42:43.250 --> 42:46.291
but I'm not seeing Rage Against
the Machine this year, man.

42:49.170 --> 42:51.360
- Chris Rock
has been making roomfuls

42:51.360 --> 42:54.120
of people laugh for
more than three decades,

42:54.120 --> 42:55.903
something he still does best.

43:01.030 --> 43:03.790
One of the most hardworking
entertainers today,

43:03.790 --> 43:06.370
his standup routines never disappoint

43:06.370 --> 43:08.130
and have kept his fans interested

43:08.130 --> 43:10.980
in his career and life for many years

43:10.980 --> 43:14.093
and will continue to do
so for many years to come.

43:20.770 --> 43:23.870
From showing his serious
side with the role in "Fargo"

43:23.870 --> 43:26.360
to developing new standup routines,

43:26.360 --> 43:28.810
Chris Rock continues to rise to the top

43:28.810 --> 43:31.490
of American comedians and has teased

43:31.490 --> 43:34.903
that he doesn't intend on
disappearing anytime soon.
