00:03.565 --> 00:05.566
England is in need
of a jolly good scare.

00:05.566 --> 00:07.631
An outrage that will summon
this country from its slumber.

00:07.631 --> 00:09.576
Blow up the observatory?

00:09.576 --> 00:14.546
I give you a month. Dynamite,
chemicals - you have carte blanche!

00:14.546 --> 00:16.546
They'll kill me.

00:16.546 --> 00:19.616
Michaelis, now released,
may be looking for revenge.

00:19.616 --> 00:21.560
Work to do, comrades.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.598
If I am such a fantasist,
Chief Inspector, explain this...

00:25.630 --> 00:28.551
It's the Professor, sir.
He has a bomb.

00:29.576 --> 00:30.608
I think he might use it.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:39.572 --> 00:41.565
Can you supply a bomb?

00:41.565 --> 00:44.614
I can supply a bomb.
Will you explode it?

00:44.614 --> 00:46.627
Why were you talking
about explosives?

00:46.627 --> 00:48.640
I was just being provocative.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.657
It's my job.

00:54.658 --> 00:56.615
If your associates were to find out

00:56.615 --> 00:59.608
that you were being paid by the
Russian Embassy to spy on them...

00:59.608 --> 01:01.621
it could end in your death.

01:01.621 --> 01:03.618
As for us, I'm sure
we'll be all right.

01:03.618 --> 01:05.607
You always find
a way to make things work.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.632
I need to see the First Secretary!
It's impossible.

01:18.592 --> 01:20.661
Imagine how good a few days
in the country will be for him.

01:20.661 --> 01:24.591
That way, you two will become much
closer. Exactly.

01:24.591 --> 01:26.616
Oi!

01:26.616 --> 01:27.644
Let's make a plan.

01:32.650 --> 01:36.648
Do you know what a secret is,
Stevie?

01:36.648 --> 01:41.594
The necessity of silence...
Not even Winnie must know.

01:41.594 --> 01:42.674
Could be father and son.

01:44.587 --> 01:46.636
Hide your deed behind
a harmless boy.

01:46.636 --> 01:48.625
You're not the bravest, are you?

01:50.682 --> 01:52.642
You screw the top on tight...

01:52.642 --> 01:55.624
it makes the connection.
Set at 20 minutes.

01:55.624 --> 01:58.609
But a short, sharp shock...
be careful...

01:58.609 --> 01:59.681
Can we go now?

01:59.681 --> 02:02.595
Yes, time to act, Verloc.

02:13.603 --> 02:14.664
Look. Look. Country!

02:14.664 --> 02:16.604
Yeah. All right.

02:17.653 --> 02:20.598
Here we are. Stevie.

02:22.679 --> 02:24.636
Come on.

02:28.617 --> 02:31.603
Look, Mr Verloc, above the tree.

02:31.603 --> 02:33.684
There's a bird just above the tree.

02:33.684 --> 02:36.613
BRAKES SQUEAL

02:38.678 --> 02:41.607
Excuse me.

02:42.699 --> 02:45.653
I want more!
I want to see more world!

02:50.683 --> 02:52.631
Stevie misses you.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.632
As long as he comes every Sunday.

02:55.645 --> 02:57.702
You don't think
he'll get lost, do you?

02:57.702 --> 03:01.635
He won't have any trouble.
I've sewn his address into his coat.

03:01.635 --> 03:03.640
I didn't expect you. Not today.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.641
Look at me - I'm here now, aren't I?

03:07.674 --> 03:10.663
Is everything as it should be?
At home.

03:10.663 --> 03:14.641
Oh, everything is as it should be.
Perhaps even more so.

03:16.653 --> 03:18.710
There's been quite
a development, actually.

03:18.710 --> 03:20.651
Really?

03:20.651 --> 03:22.696
Mr Verloc has quite taken Stevie up.

03:22.696 --> 03:26.646
You'd never guess where they are
now. They're in Kent together.

03:26.646 --> 03:27.682
Kent!

03:27.682 --> 03:30.651
Is this it? Is this Michaelis'
cottage? That's it.

03:31.660 --> 03:33.701
I waved them off, Mother.
You should see them together!

03:35.641 --> 03:36.674
Well...

03:36.674 --> 03:38.639
I know.

03:38.639 --> 03:40.699
And Mr Verloc's not too busy?

03:40.699 --> 03:42.664
He's found time for Stevie.

03:42.664 --> 03:45.666
And if things haven't worked out
so badly for Stevie -

03:45.666 --> 03:47.682
what about yourself?
Are you as included?

03:49.691 --> 03:52.712
Despite what you said,
my marriage is real, Mother.

03:54.653 --> 03:57.699
Despite what you thought,
we are a true family.

03:57.699 --> 03:59.707
Nothing will ever get
in the way of that.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.701
Good boy. Good boy.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.733
Bye.

04:03.733 --> 04:06.670
This is very kind of you.

04:06.670 --> 04:09.732
It was very kind of Lady Blackwood
to offer me such sanctuary.

04:09.732 --> 04:13.657
I wish to be generous too.
To Winnie and Stevie.

04:13.657 --> 04:16.673
But I must warn you,
the boy can be noisy.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.719
I hope we won't disturb you.

04:17.719 --> 04:20.660
I'll be locked away
with my thoughts.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.693
Thank you. Adventure!

04:22.693 --> 04:23.709
It won't be for ever!

04:23.709 --> 04:27.699
Stevie! Stevie, come on.
Come on, this way.

04:29.692 --> 04:30.696
That's it.

04:32.669 --> 04:36.727
Final Stop, Waterloo Station.
Everyone off at Waterloo Station.

04:45.711 --> 04:47.739
You are not very vigilant, are you?

04:47.739 --> 04:50.705
What? Have you not been told
to look out for me?

04:50.705 --> 04:53.690
Instructed by the
Special Crimes Division?

04:53.690 --> 04:56.699
Get off with you...
don't be such a pest.

04:56.699 --> 04:59.744
What if I was waving
a gun around? What then?

04:59.744 --> 05:01.705
But you have no weapon...

05:01.705 --> 05:03.726
I've a weapon deadlier
than any gun...

05:10.725 --> 05:12.690
How many people, do you think?

05:13.690 --> 05:14.747
What are you talking about?

05:14.747 --> 05:17.724
To blow to kingdom come?
30? 40?

05:17.724 --> 05:20.753
And afterwards, you can tell
your superiors you watched me go.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.742
The man you called a pest.

05:22.742 --> 05:25.679
Tell Heat it's the Strand next.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.705
Michaelis, I'm going to climb trees

05:39.705 --> 05:42.722
but I'm not going to get
my trousers dirty!

05:42.722 --> 05:44.759
Would that I were
so young and agile!

05:46.764 --> 05:49.777
Right, I'll take your bags
for you...

05:49.777 --> 05:53.747
Please, er...
I can manage the satchel, at least.

06:07.713 --> 06:08.781
The Professor's on an omnibus.

06:08.781 --> 06:11.742
Get a message sent.
He is NOT to be approached.

06:22.755 --> 06:23.783
Let me remind you,

06:23.783 --> 06:26.749
you told the Home Secretary
that he was the least of them.

06:26.749 --> 06:29.730
That was one blunder. Then your
manhunt finds him nowhere until

06:29.730 --> 06:31.783
he decides to show himself to us.
I'm aware of that, sir.

06:31.783 --> 06:35.752
Then don't let him make himself known to
the rest of London by way of an explosion.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.770
Stevie. Stevie.

06:41.787 --> 06:45.749
What are you doing, eh?
What are you doing?

06:45.749 --> 06:47.745
Look at me. Look at me.

06:47.745 --> 06:50.727
Don't run off like that, OK?

06:52.739 --> 06:54.804
Look at the ground.
Look at the ground.

06:54.804 --> 06:58.806
Now look at my feet. My feet.
We're going to walk together.

06:58.806 --> 07:00.775
Come on. Walk together.

07:40.735 --> 07:42.760
Do you wish to lay a hand on me?

07:42.760 --> 07:45.810
Because it would not
be enough by itself.

07:45.810 --> 07:48.735
You'd have to shoot me like a dog.

07:49.787 --> 07:52.800
Yeah, why don't you do that?

07:54.785 --> 07:57.747
I'd rather talk you out of it.

07:57.747 --> 07:59.835
Talk me out of blowing this bus up?

07:59.835 --> 08:01.788
Yeah.

08:03.773 --> 08:05.774
And no-one will be any the wiser...

08:06.838 --> 08:08.811
..and we'll all be safe.

08:08.811 --> 08:11.776
You can't pin my arms to my sides,

08:11.776 --> 08:13.841
so use your bullets,
Chief Inspector.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.802
Be ruthless. Slaughter me.

08:16.835 --> 08:18.803
What, and let the public think

08:18.803 --> 08:20.836
that you lot deserve
to be treated like that?

08:20.836 --> 08:24.750
Do you honestly think this state
will meet murder with murder?

08:24.750 --> 08:27.783
And morality will disintegrate
in its very temple.

08:27.783 --> 08:29.812
You understand the game.

08:29.812 --> 08:31.801
Congratulations.

08:31.801 --> 08:34.802
And these innocent people will be
killed. Is that the first step?

08:34.802 --> 08:36.783
Is that what you want?

08:36.783 --> 08:38.796
What I want
is the perfect detonator.

08:39.840 --> 08:43.806
A full 20 seconds must elapse
from the moment I press this ball

08:43.806 --> 08:45.831
till the explosion takes place.

08:48.784 --> 08:52.805
Imagine those 20 seconds, Inspector.
I do.

08:55.823 --> 08:58.784
For you, it'll feel
like an eternity.

09:18.804 --> 09:20.805
Get back!

09:20.805 --> 09:23.810
Move! Out of the way!

09:23.810 --> 09:25.819
PASSENGERS SCREAM

09:31.822 --> 09:33.859
Let go. Let go!

09:39.865 --> 09:41.854
THE PROFESSOR LAUGHS

09:41.854 --> 09:43.815
Buried together!

09:48.797 --> 09:50.862
Your 20 seconds are up!

09:50.862 --> 09:53.863
You've failed, Professor.

09:53.863 --> 09:57.845
Get off me! No! No!

10:18.833 --> 10:20.806
Good day's writing?

10:21.827 --> 10:22.831
No.

10:23.867 --> 10:26.841
Words wouldn't come?
Thoughts a jumble?

10:28.805 --> 10:29.874
One burning thought.

10:31.811 --> 10:33.864
Betrayal.

10:33.864 --> 10:35.852
Hidden in a satchel.

10:40.830 --> 10:41.871
Go to your room, Stevie.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.829
Go and play.

10:45.829 --> 10:47.817
You can take your food.

11:06.901 --> 11:09.859
I'm here today and gone tomorrow.

11:09.859 --> 11:11.895
No-one will ever know
we were here.

11:11.895 --> 11:16.837
I was still part of your...plan,
though, wasn't I?

11:18.838 --> 11:21.832
School the boy here, hide here!

11:21.832 --> 11:22.916
You can plead ignorance.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.881
If it was found I was involved
in any way,

11:25.881 --> 11:29.919
I would go back to prison for life,
for harbouring you!

11:29.919 --> 11:32.876
Stop shouting.
You'll get the boy going!

11:32.876 --> 11:34.893
How could you be low enough
to use him as your dupe?

11:34.893 --> 11:36.850
No-one's going to get hurt.

11:36.850 --> 11:39.859
How many lies have you told him,
huh?

11:41.844 --> 11:44.925
Well, I'm not going to be another
of your...victims.

11:44.925 --> 11:49.879
It's not even as if this device
is going to cause any harm.

11:49.879 --> 11:52.933
You've kept this from us all...
that's harm enough.

11:52.933 --> 11:56.850
You were there.
You heard my thoughts.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.891
And the Professor was happy
enough to provide...

11:58.891 --> 12:00.896
What's the target?

12:01.892 --> 12:03.889
Actually, no,
I don't want to hear about it.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.886
I don't want to know anything about
it. The observatory at Greenwich.

12:06.886 --> 12:09.892
Don't! I will not be landed in it!
It's a building, that's all!

12:09.892 --> 12:12.853
Not people.

12:12.853 --> 12:14.934
You're no terrorist, Verloc.

12:16.939 --> 12:20.856
So just tell me why you're doing it.

12:25.850 --> 12:26.943
You're an agent, aren't you?

12:28.924 --> 12:30.900
You're a spy.

12:32.869 --> 12:34.938
Prison has made you scared
of your own shadow!

12:34.938 --> 12:37.871
Seeking to betray us all!

12:37.871 --> 12:41.933
It's the Russians who want the law
brought down on you all, not me!

12:48.904 --> 12:50.921
I never expected to be used
in this way...

12:50.921 --> 12:53.862
And now you have involved me!

12:58.880 --> 13:01.921
Will you inform on me?
To our comrades?

13:02.930 --> 13:04.919
To the police?

13:06.947 --> 13:07.952
Just go.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.884
What will you do?

13:17.920 --> 13:21.950
Both will think me alongside you,
so I can say nothing.

13:23.886 --> 13:24.891
And do nothing!

13:26.912 --> 13:28.877
Go in the morning.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.913
Good for you, sir.

14:17.913 --> 14:18.917
Well done, sir.

14:23.975 --> 14:24.992
Heat.

14:27.993 --> 14:30.902
The Professor's in custody, sir.

14:30.902 --> 14:32.979
You threw yourself on him, I hear.
Smothered him.

14:32.979 --> 14:35.916
He could well have
accounted for you.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.971
Your modesty's well judged,
Chief Inspector.

14:40.971 --> 14:44.004
Given that you've previously
smothered the truth about him.

14:44.004 --> 14:47.933
Seems I am hard to remove...sir.

14:49.958 --> 14:51.959
Could well be the case, Inspector.

14:58.950 --> 15:00.975
Keep up, Stevie.

15:02.952 --> 15:04.925
Stevie!

15:04.925 --> 15:07.009
Sorry. Sorry.

15:08.974 --> 15:09.991
Keep up.

15:19.010 --> 15:21.932
SHOP BELL TINKLES

15:25.017 --> 15:26.962
Not more pamphlets!

15:26.962 --> 15:29.931
Oh, yes. Be careful, though...

15:29.931 --> 15:32.020
my words are still burning
on the page.

15:36.950 --> 15:38.935
I hear Verloc's visiting

15:38.935 --> 15:41.956
the great artist Michaelis
as he writes his opus...

15:41.956 --> 15:43.981
Yes. And Stevie is also his guest.

15:43.981 --> 15:47.002
Stevie has more ideas
in his head than Michaelis.

15:47.002 --> 15:50.023
I didn't realise
you were such a jealous person.

15:50.023 --> 15:53.949
It's just some people
don't deserve what comes their way.

15:53.949 --> 15:56.014
Michaelis, Verloc...

15:56.014 --> 15:59.971
Enough of that.
Look at you. Trapped among all this.

15:59.971 --> 16:02.957
It's called having a business
to run.

16:02.957 --> 16:04.033
SHOP BELL TINKLES

16:09.948 --> 16:11.016
Take some time off.

16:12.012 --> 16:16.042
Now. I can't just go.
Who's stopping you?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.008
Good morning.

16:31.008 --> 16:33.009
Eggs, please.

16:33.009 --> 16:34.986
No breakfast for you.

16:36.975 --> 16:40.981
You're just a madman,
not a prisoner of distinction.

16:40.981 --> 16:43.966
Well, then, I have spread
my madness, Inspector.

16:43.966 --> 16:45.967
I've been giving my stuff away.

16:47.031 --> 16:49.040
You think to alarm me?

16:49.040 --> 16:52.013
Despite the failing
of my detonator,

16:52.013 --> 16:55.991
in giving dynamite to the world,
science has done its best work.

16:55.991 --> 16:58.004
I have given dynamite
to someone else,

16:58.004 --> 17:00.048
so they may do their work.

17:00.048 --> 17:05.011
I don't believe you. You have the
keys to my lock-up. Go there.

17:05.011 --> 17:08.056
You'll find X2 powder on the floor
and the remnants of clay,

17:08.056 --> 17:10.032
still wet from recent use.

17:10.032 --> 17:12.065
Evidence that I have been
very busy, Inspector.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.041
Who for?

17:14.041 --> 17:16.031
Who for?!

17:23.998 --> 17:26.027
TRAIN APPROACHES AND SLOWS DOWN

17:26.027 --> 17:28.000
TRAIN WHISTLE

17:28.000 --> 17:31.005
Stevie! Hurry up.

17:37.992 --> 17:40.013
London train arriving. London train.

17:45.007 --> 17:47.012
I bet all the waiters know you here.

17:47.012 --> 17:50.994
"Oh, here comes Ossipon again
with another one."

17:50.994 --> 17:53.999
You sit them down
at the same table...

17:56.048 --> 18:00.033
I can't pretend I haven't...
sought the company of women.

18:01.054 --> 18:03.079
This is different, is it?

18:03.079 --> 18:06.044
For me, it's completely different.

18:10.058 --> 18:14.059
Seven years ago, I loved a man.
Son of a butcher.

18:14.059 --> 18:16.072
25 shillings a week
he brought home -

18:16.072 --> 18:19.093
but how was he to take on a girl
with an ailing mother

18:19.093 --> 18:22.027
and a poor simple brother?

18:22.027 --> 18:26.008
I had to find the courage
to slam the door in his face.

18:26.008 --> 18:30.058
And then came along Anton Verloc...
and he took us all on.

18:30.058 --> 18:36.044
And as we speak, Tom, he is Stevie's
companion. Stevie's companion!

18:36.044 --> 18:39.082
Stevie will be the only happy person
in this whole affair...

18:39.082 --> 18:44.064
No! I will too. Because
this new thing between them...

18:44.064 --> 18:47.025
I am so hopeful about it.

18:47.025 --> 18:49.022
Tell yourself that lie.

18:49.022 --> 18:51.095
But imagine more
than just the day with me.

19:15.045 --> 19:19.050
If people are killed, it won't be
in the cause of any great struggle.

19:19.050 --> 19:20.107
It'll just be murder.

19:20.107 --> 19:23.076
It will be the triumph
of a certain kind of will.

19:24.092 --> 19:29.111
Not end hunger, not deliver
the poor? Not justice for all?

19:33.028 --> 19:36.057
What kind of economic
structure are you after?

19:36.057 --> 19:39.047
One that counts
your corpses on the floor.

19:39.047 --> 19:40.127
So you can walk a little taller?

19:42.096 --> 19:45.081
You imagine my future, Inspector?
I don't.

19:45.081 --> 19:47.074
You shouldn't imagine anybody's.

19:47.074 --> 19:49.075
Least of all those you wish to save.

20:00.043 --> 20:01.132
LOUD THUD

20:05.110 --> 20:07.066
Is that your worst?

20:08.071 --> 20:10.084
Ah! Ahhh!

20:10.084 --> 20:12.104
Stop! Stop!

20:13.125 --> 20:15.082
Well? Come on! More!

20:15.082 --> 20:17.127
You might persuade me like this.

20:17.127 --> 20:20.080
I might wish to save my sight
and confess it all!

20:20.080 --> 20:22.061
Gladly...

20:22.061 --> 20:24.109
Ahh!

20:27.103 --> 20:31.136
If we torture him, he wins.
We become him.

20:31.136 --> 20:35.146
You're wrong, Inspector. Torture
me and you may get your answer.

20:37.075 --> 20:40.068
The loss of one eye
I may suffer, but two?

20:40.068 --> 20:42.125
I would surely tell you what
you need to know.

20:46.111 --> 20:49.156
I'm in thrall to you, Professor.
I'm begging you.

20:51.081 --> 20:52.129
Help me.

21:01.101 --> 21:03.158
Cometh the hour,
cometh the man, eh, Stevie?

21:03.158 --> 21:05.159
I don't know...

21:05.159 --> 21:08.160
Just means being brave.
We're brave, aren't we?

21:08.160 --> 21:10.133
Yes, I am. Are you?

21:12.126 --> 21:15.131
You are in thrall to the law,
Inspector.

21:15.131 --> 21:19.080
I am only in thrall
to what I desire.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.089
And therein lies my power.

21:21.089 --> 21:22.122
Who have you supplied?

21:23.138 --> 21:25.123
Who have you supplied?!

21:25.123 --> 21:26.163
Nearly there...

21:26.163 --> 21:28.128
Time to set men free?!

21:28.128 --> 21:30.105
Quiet, Stevie.

21:30.105 --> 21:33.086
Why do we have to leave Kent?
Outstayed our welcome.

21:33.086 --> 21:34.175
Didn't Michaelis like us?

21:34.175 --> 21:36.111
Did I do something naughty?

21:36.111 --> 21:38.172
Stevie, we've got a job to do.

21:38.172 --> 21:40.165
No more holiday.

21:40.165 --> 21:42.158
Now, put the bags down there.

21:42.158 --> 21:44.151
That's it.

21:44.151 --> 21:47.108
Hide and seek? Stevie!

21:47.108 --> 21:48.145
Come back here. Now!

21:52.146 --> 21:55.099
This is a serious business
we're doing here.

21:55.099 --> 21:57.100
It's a serious business.

21:57.100 --> 22:02.102
Yes. So... We've got plenty of time.

22:03.163 --> 22:07.168
We go up the hill.
Put it against the wall.

22:11.106 --> 22:12.175
And then we go home.

22:30.154 --> 22:33.151
It is to be a demonstration
against a building.

22:33.151 --> 22:36.120
I had hoped for rather more
in the way of destruction.

22:36.120 --> 22:39.130
Which building? I depend on death,
not just mere bricks falling down...

22:39.130 --> 22:40.194
Which building?!

22:47.121 --> 22:49.186
Right. Stevie, stop here.

23:01.175 --> 23:03.156
Make the connection.

23:04.196 --> 23:06.129
Not too tight...

23:15.137 --> 23:17.210
I'll go for you!
Stevie...! No! I'm a good boy!

23:17.210 --> 23:20.195
Stevie...!
I'll be a good boy! Good boy.

23:20.195 --> 23:22.148
Stevie, no!

23:23.144 --> 23:25.165
PEOPLE SCREAM

24:19.199 --> 24:23.245
You got your wish. It was more
than mere bricks falling down.

24:28.199 --> 24:32.221
HE LAUGHS

24:32.221 --> 24:35.166
HE ROARS

25:12.214 --> 25:14.210
Stay back.

25:14.210 --> 25:15.263
Stay back, please.

25:15.263 --> 25:17.236
Stay back.

25:26.183 --> 25:28.184
I was the first on the scene.

25:28.184 --> 25:29.241
I saw from over there

25:29.241 --> 25:31.261
what looked like a flash
of lightning.

25:33.190 --> 25:34.271
He would have died instantly.

25:34.271 --> 25:38.188
Any witnesses?
Anyone see him before this?

25:38.188 --> 25:41.190
There were sightings
of two men together...

25:41.190 --> 25:42.218
Two?

25:42.218 --> 25:46.204
A shorter older man
and a taller younger one, sir.

25:47.208 --> 25:50.193
Which one's this?
Impossible to say, sir.

25:51.214 --> 25:53.263
We need to transfer
this body to the morgue.

25:57.272 --> 26:00.194
I threw the tarpaulin over the...

26:01.286 --> 26:03.287
..but I'm not sure I'm up to...

26:03.287 --> 26:06.256
No need. I'll do this.

26:06.256 --> 26:08.285
Not your function at all, sir...
I said, I'll do this.

26:42.271 --> 26:44.208
HE VOMITS

26:53.284 --> 26:58.302
Stupid, stupid murderous trick
to expose me like that.

26:58.302 --> 27:01.311
To perform such an act.
And for what?

27:01.311 --> 27:05.253
To what end?
Who's dead? Not you, obviously.

27:05.253 --> 27:07.237
No. Not yet...

27:07.237 --> 27:12.292
I have run the risk for 11 years
of being stabbed in the back

27:12.292 --> 27:14.280
for my double-dealing and now...

27:14.280 --> 27:17.294
now they will all come for me.
You have to protect me!

27:17.294 --> 27:19.274
Me?! Why?

27:19.274 --> 27:22.292
Why? My dear fellow, you must get
yourself out of the country!

27:22.292 --> 27:25.309
Get out now while everyone
thinks you are the casualty.

27:25.309 --> 27:29.283
Is that all you have for me?
You have done your job.

27:29.283 --> 27:33.232
Now we must wait and see how
Parliament will legislate for it.

27:34.269 --> 27:36.306
I killed her brother!

27:36.306 --> 27:40.267
That simple...wretched boy.

27:40.267 --> 27:43.296
Well, obviously better if it hadn't
been sanguinary at all

27:43.296 --> 27:45.245
but there we have it.

27:45.245 --> 27:47.314
Now, when you leave the Embassy,
please make sure nobody sees you.

27:47.314 --> 27:50.239
It has to be as if you
were never here.

27:50.239 --> 27:54.269
I'm sure you can manage that.
After all, you are a spy.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.308
They may not even trace this to you.

28:02.308 --> 28:04.325
Your associate, is he identifiable?

28:10.272 --> 28:12.281
I don't think so.

28:12.281 --> 28:14.329
Well, then, you may be in luck.

28:14.329 --> 28:17.299
And nobody will ever know
you were involved at all.

28:17.299 --> 28:21.304
That may be some consolation
for you.

28:21.304 --> 28:23.289
Goodbye.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.363
Two gentlemen seen coming out
of Maze Hill Station

29:07.363 --> 29:11.273
some 15 minutes
before the explosion...

29:11.273 --> 29:13.290
Their tickets given in?

29:20.301 --> 29:22.310
Also got a woman come forward...

29:22.310 --> 29:26.283
attends the chapel in Park Place
sometimes. Saw the two men...

29:26.283 --> 29:29.313
The older one carrying
a canvas bag on his shoulder.

29:31.317 --> 29:33.278
Must have stumbled.

29:34.323 --> 29:36.308
Sir?

29:36.308 --> 29:38.284
Stumbled and fell.

29:41.290 --> 29:43.358
Quite a mess he's made
of himself there, sir...

29:50.369 --> 29:52.310
Cover up.

30:01.334 --> 30:02.350
Read all about it!

30:07.388 --> 30:09.293
Sir...

30:11.298 --> 30:14.359
That...piece of cloth you put
in your pocket...

30:14.359 --> 30:15.364
What of it?

30:17.325 --> 30:18.349
Precisely that, sir.

30:19.389 --> 30:21.302
Is it significant?

30:23.339 --> 30:27.357
When intelligence is shared too much
it stops being any such thing.

31:01.411 --> 31:03.344
BELL JANGLES

31:15.397 --> 31:18.322
Where's Stevie?

31:18.322 --> 31:19.366
I couldn't drag him away.

31:22.352 --> 31:24.421
It's worked like a dream, Winnie.

31:24.421 --> 31:26.401
I told you it would.

31:26.401 --> 31:28.402
Will Michaelis look after him?

31:28.402 --> 31:31.391
I told him he'd have to reckon
with you if he didn't.

31:34.357 --> 31:36.350
Should I be worried? Is he...happy?

31:36.350 --> 31:39.375
Is he missing me? He's having the
time of his life, Winnie.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.364
He's climbing trees.

31:43.409 --> 31:45.333
Sorry...

31:45.333 --> 31:47.350
I'm sorry... I...

31:48.387 --> 31:50.363
I feel I'm catching a chill.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.353
I'll make your tea presently.

31:54.353 --> 31:55.414
Don't want you laid up, do I?

31:57.394 --> 31:59.339
That won't be so.

32:00.412 --> 32:02.380
I'll cause you no trouble.

32:06.414 --> 32:10.344
Is...that why you left Kent,
cos you were getting a chill?

32:16.414 --> 32:18.387
Things to attend to in London.

32:20.416 --> 32:22.357
Winnie,

32:22.357 --> 32:24.394
I'm going to retrieve all my money.

32:24.394 --> 32:26.418
What for?

32:26.418 --> 32:29.364
I was thinking, down there...

32:29.364 --> 32:31.352
maybe we should move away.

32:31.352 --> 32:32.405
Abroad.

32:32.405 --> 32:35.358
France, maybe, or California.

32:35.358 --> 32:37.407
Wonderful business
opportunities there.

32:37.407 --> 32:38.411
The idea!

32:39.420 --> 32:41.385
The business isn't so bad.

32:42.401 --> 32:44.410
You've a comfortable home here.

32:45.438 --> 32:48.436
Be... Besides, I think it would
unsettle Stevie.

32:53.366 --> 32:54.422
Let's talk about it when he's home.

33:31.405 --> 33:34.383
Even if none of our known anarchists
had anything to do with this,

33:34.383 --> 33:37.384
for the public it still looks like
a profession of ignorance. Yes, sir.

33:37.384 --> 33:39.401
The Professor obviously unable
to enlighten you -

33:39.401 --> 33:41.438
unless you've brought something
back from Greenwich,

33:41.438 --> 33:43.382
our ignorance is still apparent.

33:43.382 --> 33:44.479
We're following the leads
on the two men, sir.

33:44.479 --> 33:46.448
Something and nothing, Inspector.

33:46.448 --> 33:49.409
Or do you just mean to keep
me at bay? Why would I do that?

33:49.409 --> 33:50.441
To regain the initiative.

33:50.441 --> 33:53.479
To repair a reputation
that has undoubtedly been damaged.

33:55.391 --> 33:56.428
In here.

34:10.469 --> 34:12.427
This is what might be said of you.

34:12.427 --> 34:14.447
That you concentrated
on the possibility of a bomb

34:14.447 --> 34:16.464
that might go off
at the expense of one that did.

34:16.464 --> 34:18.429
That your assurances
to Sir Ethelred,

34:18.429 --> 34:20.474
though technically correct,
are quite beside the point,

34:20.474 --> 34:22.471
because there is a dead man
in Greenwich Park

34:22.471 --> 34:26.404
and everyone is asking the question,
"When will be the next explosion?"

34:27.453 --> 34:31.431
I say all this mindful of your -
so far - unimpeachable reputation.

34:33.411 --> 34:37.413
Especially when you have no answers.
No new information.

34:40.449 --> 34:41.455
Well?

34:52.503 --> 34:55.485
I took that from the remains
of the body in the morgue.

34:55.485 --> 34:57.413
What's this?

34:57.413 --> 34:59.418
It's an address in Soho.

34:59.418 --> 35:00.483
A shop.

35:00.483 --> 35:01.503
Belonging to?

35:03.468 --> 35:04.484
Verloc.

35:06.429 --> 35:08.454
Well, this is worse than
a confession of ignorance.

35:08.454 --> 35:12.436
This is one of the anarchists that's
known to us. Verloc's dead, sir -

35:12.436 --> 35:13.492
but the other man's still at large,

35:13.492 --> 35:15.449
and we know who it is.

35:24.473 --> 35:25.497
Given in at Maze Hill.

35:30.491 --> 35:32.520
Only three people got off
that particular train,

35:32.520 --> 35:34.485
and one of them was a woman.

35:34.485 --> 35:35.509
Where'd they come from?

35:35.509 --> 35:37.514
A little country station in Kent.

35:40.439 --> 35:43.449
Seems...unaccountable
they'd come from that place.

35:43.449 --> 35:44.501
Yes - but not when you know

35:44.501 --> 35:46.522
that Michaelis is staying in
a cottage there.

35:50.491 --> 35:51.520
I know about this.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.481
He's writing a book down there.
Yeah, that may be his alibi.

35:54.481 --> 35:57.454
The cottage is owned by Lady
Blackwood. It's her...gift to him.

35:57.454 --> 35:59.463
Where he can find inspiration.

35:59.463 --> 36:01.460
Well, in that case,
I should go down there

36:01.460 --> 36:04.441
and see how many pages
he's been inspired to write, sir.

36:04.441 --> 36:05.458
It's genuine!

36:05.458 --> 36:06.526
He's a suspect, sir.

36:06.526 --> 36:08.523
And Verloc was there with him.

36:11.512 --> 36:13.497
Very well...

36:13.497 --> 36:16.494
but conduct yourself with some
delicacy down there, for God's sake.

36:16.494 --> 36:18.451
Delicacy?

36:18.451 --> 36:21.448
Refrain from making accusations
that you can't...

36:22.477 --> 36:24.478
Be careful, do you hear me?

36:24.478 --> 36:26.518
Lady Blackwood is his patron,
do you understand?

36:28.467 --> 36:29.488
Perfectly, sir.

36:37.499 --> 36:38.503
HE GRUNTS

36:59.512 --> 37:01.489
Whoa! Steady.

37:01.489 --> 37:02.493
Whoa.

37:09.484 --> 37:10.549
Chief Inspector Heat.

37:10.549 --> 37:12.510
Special Crimes Division.

37:12.510 --> 37:14.554
Two tickets from here to Greenwich.

37:20.477 --> 37:23.514
You shouldn't come here and
interfere with me, you know.

37:24.571 --> 37:27.484
I've been taken up by certain...

37:28.556 --> 37:30.497
..people.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.546
Very influential. I know.

37:33.546 --> 37:34.575
I know.

37:34.575 --> 37:37.536
Did you buy a ticket back
from Greenwich to here?

37:37.536 --> 37:40.513
You know, you and Verloc,
you ventured out together,

37:40.513 --> 37:42.550
then, after, you came back alone.

37:44.535 --> 37:45.571
In shock, no doubt.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.537
I am in shock because
you tell me he is dead.

37:49.537 --> 37:52.526
And you don't feel you had
a part to play in that?

37:52.526 --> 37:54.531
I didn't, I wasn't there.

37:54.531 --> 37:56.544
All your influential people,

37:56.544 --> 37:59.489
they can't save you
from the truth coming out.

37:59.489 --> 38:02.498
Not a man like you.
A ticket-of-leave man.

38:02.498 --> 38:04.539
You can't afford to make
one mistake,

38:04.539 --> 38:07.497
let alone get mixed up
in something like this.

38:07.497 --> 38:08.537
I didn't get mixed up in it.

38:08.537 --> 38:09.541
Then what?

38:12.539 --> 38:13.563
What?!

38:16.552 --> 38:17.589
It...

38:20.498 --> 38:21.522
It wasn't voluntary.

38:23.523 --> 38:25.512
I didn't choose to.

38:25.512 --> 38:27.537
So, Verloc was here,
and you went off together?

38:27.537 --> 38:28.553
No. I didn't go.

38:28.553 --> 38:31.555
Two men!
Two men were identified there!

38:31.555 --> 38:32.587
Stevie!

38:32.587 --> 38:34.580
The other man was Stevie!

38:34.580 --> 38:36.585
Who's Stevie? His brother-in-law...

38:38.509 --> 38:40.586
He didn't even know the dirty work
he was doing for him.

38:42.559 --> 38:44.512
Where is he now?

38:44.512 --> 38:45.552
Uh...

38:45.552 --> 38:48.570
Hiding in a ditch scared out of
his wits, most probably.

38:48.570 --> 38:50.558
Why would Verloc embark
on such a thing?

38:50.558 --> 38:52.523
He didn't take
me into his confidence.

38:52.523 --> 38:54.576
He knew I wouldn't approve.
If you had prior knowledge...

38:54.576 --> 38:55.581
I knew nothing.

38:56.609 --> 38:58.582
I was in my room the whole time.

39:01.543 --> 39:03.516
It's an autobiography, you know?

39:04.576 --> 39:06.537
The suffering I've gone through.

39:08.586 --> 39:11.607
Lady Blackwood is my patron.
Yeah, I know.

39:11.607 --> 39:12.612
I know.

39:15.561 --> 39:16.605
And you're quite immune.

39:36.622 --> 39:39.603
I never hoped to see you
here tonight.

39:39.603 --> 39:43.573
Annie said you may be occupied
with the bombing.

39:43.573 --> 39:47.534
We have one fatality,
another still at large.

39:47.534 --> 39:49.583
We hope to know his
identity soon enough.

39:49.583 --> 39:52.604
Hope you are rounding them all up,
Assistant Commissioner.

39:52.604 --> 39:55.578
Better to eliminate suspects
from our enquiries, one by one.

39:55.578 --> 39:57.626
Mm, softly-softly?
Where has that got you?

39:57.626 --> 39:59.611
It's how we do things here.

39:59.611 --> 40:01.544
It's procedure.

40:01.544 --> 40:02.556
Procedure?

40:02.556 --> 40:04.589
What sort of suspects?

40:04.589 --> 40:05.626
Who are they?

40:05.626 --> 40:08.551
The anarchists.
The political activists.

40:08.551 --> 40:11.568
Including even those you have
embraced, Lady Blackwood.

40:11.568 --> 40:12.609
Michaelis?

40:12.609 --> 40:14.609
I hope you're not bringing him in.

40:14.609 --> 40:17.567
Do you have any idea what
that might do to him?

40:17.567 --> 40:19.604
But if he is party
to any such conspiracy...

40:19.604 --> 40:22.641
He is in Kent now, and there's only
one passion urging him on.

40:22.641 --> 40:25.566
Mr Stone...

40:25.566 --> 40:28.575
Only one passion occupies him.
His writing -

40:28.575 --> 40:31.553
which I shall soon see into
publication.

40:31.553 --> 40:33.565
How exciting. Quite.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.646
In the meantime, it must be the only
thing to detain him.

40:37.615 --> 40:40.584
Tolerance can be folly, though,
can it not?

40:40.584 --> 40:42.645
In the bigger matter of the
security of your country,

40:42.645 --> 40:45.578
if these people are not
suppressed, squashed,

40:45.578 --> 40:48.560
then the conflagration may spread

40:48.560 --> 40:51.565
from an attempt on
the Observatory to...

40:51.565 --> 40:52.625
every city in the country.

40:52.625 --> 40:54.630
You think it that grave an affair?

40:54.630 --> 40:57.579
Or do you simply intend to
frighten us all?

40:57.579 --> 40:59.580
It's what he's in England for.

40:59.580 --> 41:01.585
You only have a dead body -

41:01.585 --> 41:03.658
the perpetrator you cannot
even identify.

41:03.658 --> 41:05.583
Yes, we can.

41:05.583 --> 41:07.576
Oh, oh, really? Really?

41:07.576 --> 41:08.624
Well, let me guess...

41:08.624 --> 41:10.577
it's confidential.

41:11.657 --> 41:13.634
His name's Verloc.

41:13.634 --> 41:15.603
It was.

41:19.605 --> 41:21.661
The fatality? The dead man? Mmm.

41:21.661 --> 41:23.610
I see.

41:24.655 --> 41:27.632
You're party to different
information, Mr Vladimir?

41:27.632 --> 41:29.629
Why would you think that?
You're smiling.

41:29.629 --> 41:30.665
I am? Why?

41:34.615 --> 41:36.616
I have a very good hand, that's all.

42:08.669 --> 42:10.602
Excuse me, my lady.

42:16.608 --> 42:18.601
Verloc's still alive.

42:18.601 --> 42:19.622
No.

42:19.622 --> 42:20.686
No, I'm sorry, that can't be.

42:20.686 --> 42:22.643
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

42:22.643 --> 42:24.644
It's his brother-in-law Stevie
who survived.

42:24.644 --> 42:26.620
You know that for a fact?

42:26.620 --> 42:28.613
No, but Michaelis is sure of it.

42:28.613 --> 42:31.639
Did Michaelis identify the body?
Did you?

42:31.639 --> 42:32.679
The Russians know differently.

42:32.679 --> 42:35.632
Then if he's hiding out in his shop,
I'll go there at once...

42:35.632 --> 42:37.645
Arresting him will have to wait.
So he can escape?

42:37.645 --> 42:38.649
I've had to suffer

42:38.649 --> 42:40.678
the First Secretary's smug
expression all evening -

42:40.678 --> 42:42.639
as if he's been in the know
all along.

42:42.639 --> 42:44.644
Why would he know about
Verloc and his fate?

42:45.680 --> 42:47.633
Perhaps there's a connection.

42:49.610 --> 42:50.642
Heat, I'm warning you -

42:50.642 --> 42:52.639
I will no longer allow
your idea of secrecy

42:52.639 --> 42:54.692
to be keeping your
Chief of Department in the dark!

42:58.630 --> 42:59.662
He's their agent.

42:59.662 --> 43:00.679
How do you know that?

43:02.659 --> 43:04.652
Because he's also mine.

43:04.652 --> 43:07.622
An asset I've been exploiting
on and off for the past few years.

43:07.622 --> 43:09.630
So you've been making use
of this man privately?

43:09.630 --> 43:10.655
But now we know what we know,

43:10.655 --> 43:12.648
we can't let him get away
with dropping a bomb

43:12.648 --> 43:13.716
That's not up to you. But, sir,

43:13.716 --> 43:16.677
it would be a perversion of my duty.
Did you hear me?!

43:16.677 --> 43:19.639
The point is not him,
is what's behind him.

43:19.639 --> 43:21.623
Vladimir.

43:21.623 --> 43:24.669
You forget Mr Verloc.
You leave that responsibility to me.

43:24.669 --> 43:25.717
Do you understand?

43:30.663 --> 43:31.708
I'll be off home, then, sir.

43:33.712 --> 43:35.725
Make sure it isn't through
Soho, Inspector.

43:42.668 --> 43:43.681
Thank you.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.701
You're thinking about the boy?

44:15.690 --> 44:16.742
I just miss him so much.

44:20.660 --> 44:22.673
We've never been away from each
other before.

44:25.690 --> 44:28.719
It seems wrong that he's not
at home, and I am.

44:30.708 --> 44:32.673
He's in some village somewhere,

44:32.673 --> 44:34.706
hearing sounds
he's never heard before.

44:37.671 --> 44:39.672
I hope he's not scared out his wits.

44:42.705 --> 44:45.690
I hope he's...not missing me.

44:49.700 --> 44:51.693
You could at least reassure me.

44:54.674 --> 44:56.687
Just think of the good
it's doing him.

45:02.742 --> 45:04.722
Why can't you sleep, Anton?

45:13.742 --> 45:15.707
I shall count sheep.

45:18.760 --> 45:20.765
I imagine Stevie is doing so now.

45:22.702 --> 45:23.730
Quite literally!

45:49.781 --> 45:52.686
Sit. Sir.

45:55.704 --> 45:57.736
Is this the beginning
of a dynamite campaign?

45:57.736 --> 45:59.705
I rather think not, Sir Ethelred.

45:59.705 --> 46:01.750
Well, what does Heat think?
He gave me his word in this room

46:01.750 --> 46:03.755
that we would be safe
from any anarchist attack.

46:03.755 --> 46:06.728
I think it's still safe to say that,
sir. So, what was Greenwich?

46:06.728 --> 46:08.761
More anomaly than plot.
Not a conspiracy?

46:08.761 --> 46:11.726
Not in that way.
But the Professor supplied the bomb?

46:11.726 --> 46:13.751
More transaction than conspiracy.

46:13.751 --> 46:16.792
Sir, this is a situation
that requires some delicacy.

46:16.792 --> 46:18.717
Some secrecy.

46:20.774 --> 46:21.794
Why?

46:23.715 --> 46:26.704
There's a figure in the pay
of a certain embassy...

46:27.757 --> 46:28.785
A Mr Verloc.

46:28.785 --> 46:30.730
Known to us as an anarchist?

46:30.730 --> 46:32.791
In fact, a spy and agent
provocateur for the Russians.

46:32.791 --> 46:34.736
This was a Russian plot?

46:34.736 --> 46:36.713
Orchestrated by
Mr Vladimir, I believe.

46:36.713 --> 46:39.710
My God, these people are impossible.

46:39.710 --> 46:40.802
A Turk would have more decency!

46:40.802 --> 46:42.759
Quite.

46:42.759 --> 46:44.772
So, what do we do about this Verloc?

46:44.772 --> 46:48.746
In my opinion, offer him
immunity from prosecution

46:48.746 --> 46:50.743
in exchange for everything
he can tell us.

46:50.743 --> 46:52.783
In your opinion?

46:52.783 --> 46:53.808
Yes, sir.

47:32.796 --> 47:34.733
Where are you going?

47:38.747 --> 47:40.743
Are you going to collect Stevie?

47:42.816 --> 47:43.829
Yes, I...

47:45.733 --> 47:46.810
I'll attend to the boy.

47:59.811 --> 48:01.780
DISTANT SOBBING

48:19.832 --> 48:21.780
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

48:23.785 --> 48:24.790
Yes?

48:27.815 --> 48:29.788
Is there a body here?

48:29.788 --> 48:31.797
We have lots of bodies here.

48:34.790 --> 48:37.795
I mean the one recovered
from Greenwich Park.

48:37.795 --> 48:39.776
Some sort of ghoul, are you?

48:39.776 --> 48:41.777
I thought I should see it.
That's all.

48:41.777 --> 48:42.817
"Should"?

48:45.802 --> 48:47.771
COINS CLINK

48:49.848 --> 48:51.809
Even if you were
from the newspapers,

48:51.809 --> 48:53.794
I couldn't allow you
to take a photograph.

48:53.794 --> 48:55.779
Police attend the body?
No, I attend it.

48:58.852 --> 49:00.833
And it's not a body.

49:00.833 --> 49:01.861
It's just a mess.

50:11.866 --> 50:13.839
BELL JANGLES

50:22.815 --> 50:24.804
Is your husband home?

50:24.804 --> 50:26.813
No. He's gone out.

50:26.813 --> 50:27.869
Do you know when he'll be back?

50:27.869 --> 50:28.897
Can't say.

50:30.894 --> 50:33.819
So, you're here all alone, then?

50:33.819 --> 50:34.860
Yes.

50:37.873 --> 50:40.806
What, no family member
to help you out?

50:40.806 --> 50:41.831
My brother's in Kent.

50:42.871 --> 50:43.904
With Mr Michaelis?

50:46.829 --> 50:47.881
Who are you?

50:47.881 --> 50:49.850
You've been in before.

50:49.850 --> 50:52.867
Chief Inspector Heat.
Special Crimes Division.

50:52.867 --> 50:54.900
Isn't a crime to hold a meeting.

50:55.909 --> 50:57.905
You can't be arrested
for your thoughts.

50:57.905 --> 51:00.835
It's more than just
their thoughts.

51:00.835 --> 51:01.895
What are you talking about?

51:05.821 --> 51:07.834
Well, you've no idea
what's happened, have you?

51:09.854 --> 51:12.844
Well, tell him I know
exactly what's happened.

51:13.860 --> 51:15.917
You're not going to scare me.
I know that much.

51:15.917 --> 51:17.914
My Anton's a good man.

51:17.914 --> 51:19.867
He doesn't need tormenting.

51:19.867 --> 51:21.867
Why don't you just leave him alone?

51:33.924 --> 51:35.869
Do you recognise this?

51:39.851 --> 51:40.923
It's this address. I wrote it.

51:43.865 --> 51:44.917
So that Stevie wouldn't get lost,

51:44.917 --> 51:47.886
so he could always show someone
where he lived.

51:47.886 --> 51:50.836
So, it's from Stevie's coat.

51:50.836 --> 51:52.896
Yeah. Whatever's it torn out
like this for?

51:54.889 --> 51:57.906
It was recovered
from Greenwich Park.

51:57.906 --> 51:58.931
The bomb outrage.

52:00.848 --> 52:01.892
Have you heard of it?

52:01.892 --> 52:04.873
Yeah. I've heard of it.
I haven't read about it.

52:04.873 --> 52:06.934
Some things don't bear
too much looking into.

52:08.895 --> 52:10.928
Anyway, what's that got to do
with Stevie's coat?

52:16.846 --> 52:18.879
Stevie's in Kent with Mr Michaelis.

52:20.864 --> 52:21.904
No, he's not.

52:21.904 --> 52:22.917
He is.

52:22.917 --> 52:26.883
Stevie was your brother, wasn't he?
What do you mean "wasn't he"?

52:26.883 --> 52:27.931
He still is.

52:27.931 --> 52:29.920
He still is my brother!

52:34.866 --> 52:35.894
I'm sorry.

52:40.952 --> 52:43.906
He said he was climbing trees,
getting his trousers dirty.

52:43.906 --> 52:45.858
He said he was having fun.

52:52.929 --> 52:55.919
Tell Mr Verloc
I won't be coming back again.

54:20.950 --> 54:21.958
SHE GASPS

54:36.949 --> 54:37.997
You must have been mad.

54:37.997 --> 54:40.966
I have been mad for a month or so.

54:40.966 --> 54:42.967
But not now. Not any more.

54:42.967 --> 54:45.993
I was humiliated by you.
You lied to me.

54:45.993 --> 54:48.950
Just take me in. I'm ready.

54:49.962 --> 54:51.923
I've been told to stay away.

54:52.975 --> 54:54.956
Others have plans for you.

54:56.917 --> 54:57.986
It'll all come out.

54:57.986 --> 54:59.966
That's not what they want.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.012
Then why are you here?

55:06.925 --> 55:07.994
I want to see your guilt.

55:07.994 --> 55:09.938
Look at me!

55:09.938 --> 55:11.959
How can you live with yourself?

55:16.925 --> 55:17.934
Look at that.

55:17.934 --> 55:19.923
Look! Look!

55:23.980 --> 55:25.961
Not all of him was blown to bits.

55:28.006 --> 55:29.927
She knows.

55:32.016 --> 55:33.944
She knows.

55:35.957 --> 55:36.970
Agh!

55:39.987 --> 55:41.019
She's waiting for you!

56:10.000 --> 56:11.944
