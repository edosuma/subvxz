01:54.125 --> 01:56.225
Allen, Bomb Squad,
Special Services...

01:56.325 --> 01:58.826
State Police and the FBI!

01:59.125 --> 02:02.725
Lieutenant Jurgenson, Upummer! I want
you to go to St. John's Emergency...

02:03.025 --> 02:05.325
in case we got any walk-ins
from the street.

02:05.525 --> 02:08.025
- Take that down there and get it faxed.
- Kramer, get the city engineer!

02:08.225 --> 02:10.425
I gotta find out a damage report.
It's very important.

02:10.725 --> 02:13.125
Bonwit Teller. Who the hell would want
to blow up a department store?

02:13.325 --> 02:15.125
Did you ever see a woman
miss a shoe sale?

02:15.425 --> 02:17.625
Connie, I want you to get started
on the witness sheet.

02:17.925 --> 02:21.125
Ricky, you and Joe, you make sure
the uniforms got it cordoned off there.

02:21.425 --> 02:24.725
And you don't let
the damn TV crews in. Benson!

02:25.025 --> 02:28.125
- Inspector, phone.
- Not now. Benson! Traffic!

02:28.525 --> 02:31.726
We get Fifth Avenue cleared up by 3:00,
or we got the traffic jam from hell!

02:31.926 --> 02:33.726
- Walter!
- Yeah?

02:33.926 --> 02:37.226
I think you'd better take this.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.426
Major Case Unit,
Inspector Cobb.

02:41.626 --> 02:43.626
Said Simple Simon to the pie man
going to the fair...

02:43.826 --> 02:45.926
"Give me your pies...

02:46.126 --> 02:48.926
or I'll cave your head in."

02:49.126 --> 02:52.326
You see, Bonwit's was just
to make sure I had your attention.

02:52.626 --> 02:55.726
Is there a detective
named McClane there?

02:56.026 --> 03:00.726
- He's on suspension.
- No, Walter, he's not. Not today.

03:01.026 --> 03:03.626
- Who is this?
- Call me Simon.

03:03.926 --> 03:06.826
- What do you want?
- I want to play a game.

03:07.026 --> 03:09.826
- What kind of game?
- "Simon says."

03:11.526 --> 03:13.926
Simon's going to tell
Lt McClane what to do...

03:14.126 --> 03:17.226
and Lt McClane is going to do it.

03:17.626 --> 03:20.726
Noncompliance will result
in a penalty.

03:21.026 --> 03:22.726
What penalty?

03:23.026 --> 03:26.126
Another big bang
in a very public place.

03:28.726 --> 03:31.526
What is it that you want
Lt McClane to do?

03:31.826 --> 03:34.126
Simon says Lt McClane
is to go to the corner...

03:34.426 --> 03:37.026
of 138th Street und Amsterdam...

03:37.226 --> 03:39.326
which is in Harlem
if I'm not mistaken.

03:39.526 --> 03:43.427
Kowalski! Lambert!
Do you know where to find McClane?

03:43.627 --> 03:45.627
Well, I kinda doubt
you're gonna find him in church.

03:45.927 --> 03:49.127
Well, you better find out
what rock he's under...

03:49.527 --> 03:50.927
and kick it over.

04:02.827 --> 04:06.527
- John.
- Thanks.

04:14.027 --> 04:15.927
Gimme some more. Come on.

04:17.527 --> 04:20.427
Jesus, John.
You look like shit.

04:25.027 --> 04:27.427
Where did we leave off
with that roster?

04:27.627 --> 04:31.127
We got three killings in Red Hook
the past two nights.

04:31.527 --> 04:33.627
Put Miner on it.
And Genetti.

04:33.827 --> 04:35.727
The mayor's office will call
before the day's out.

04:35.927 --> 04:40.227
Next, 14 dump trucks stolen
from a yard in Staten Island.

04:40.527 --> 04:44.827
Fourteen! Jesus! Is somebody
starting a construction company?

04:45.127 --> 04:47.527
Nah, it was John's landlady
going to clean his apartment.

04:50.027 --> 04:52.027
Insurance fraud.

04:52.127 --> 04:54.928
That's a priority
out in California.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.228
The contractor splits the money
with the thieves.

04:57.428 --> 04:59.928
We had that out in Jersey
a couple years ago, Joe. Remember?

05:00.128 --> 05:03.328
See what Kelly can do with it.

05:03.628 --> 05:05.528
Hey, what was the lottery number
last night?

05:05.728 --> 05:07.828
- 4667.
- 4667.

05:09.828 --> 05:11.628
You still bettin' your badge, Rick?

05:11.828 --> 05:14.428
Yeah, 6991 every week.

05:16.528 --> 05:18.628
6991, lucky number.

05:18.928 --> 05:21.628
Half the cops in New York
play their badges.

05:21.928 --> 05:24.828
How're the kids, John?

05:25.128 --> 05:27.728
I hear they're okay.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.228
Did you talk with Holly?

05:33.128 --> 05:36.228
- No, I didn't talk to Holly.
- Coming up on it, Inspector.

05:38.228 --> 05:40.328
Is it hot in here,
or am I just scared to death?

05:40.528 --> 05:43.828
You wanna make sure
the gun's secure?

05:44.128 --> 05:46.128
Yeah, it's good.

05:53.528 --> 05:56.028
You know, you're the first woman
since Holly who's seen me do this.

05:56.328 --> 06:00.528
- I'm honoured.
- Yeah, so was she.

06:03.928 --> 06:07.029
So, where's the backup gonna be?

06:10.329 --> 06:13.329
We're gonna drop back
to 128th Street.

06:13.629 --> 06:15.929
What?

06:16.229 --> 06:18.929
Ten blocks?
Are you fucking kidding me?

06:19.129 --> 06:22.529
Oh, man, that's just great! Hey, Walter,
what is all this about, huh?

06:22.929 --> 06:26.029
- If we don't do it, this guy says he's
gonna blow up another public place.
- Well, why me?

06:26.329 --> 06:30.529
- What does it got to do with me?
- I have no idea. He just said
it had to be you.

06:32.929 --> 06:35.629
It's nice to be needed.

06:35.929 --> 06:39.129
- Frankly, John, you haven't been...
- Hey, Walter, how 'bout you mind your
fucking business about Holly, huh?

06:40.629 --> 06:44.129
Between you and Simon, you're
fucking up a perfectly good hangover.

06:47.429 --> 06:49.229
Okay.

06:58.529 --> 07:01.129
We'll be back to pick you up
in 15 minutes.

07:01.429 --> 07:04.529
Take your time.
I expect to be dead in four.

07:05.529 --> 07:08.029
Let's go, Billy!

07:29.630 --> 07:31.330
Oh, man.

07:58.330 --> 08:01.230
- Hey, yo, Uncle.
- Come look at this.

08:03.130 --> 08:05.130
It's ten after 9:00.
Why aren't you in school?

08:05.230 --> 08:09.630
- Tony wants to sell you this.
- Tony? That no-neck dude
they call Bad T?

08:10.030 --> 08:11.930
He says he found it
in a Dumpster.

08:12.130 --> 08:14.530
He keeps stealing from people,
they're gonna find him in a Dumpster.

08:14.730 --> 08:17.630
No, he didn't steal it.
He says his uncle gave it to him.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.930
Mm-hmm. Hand me
that newspaper over there.

08:23.730 --> 08:25.530
Don't ever let people use you.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.631
You're runnin' all over town
with stolen property.

08:27.831 --> 08:29.631
If you get caught,
you get in trouble...

08:29.831 --> 08:32.030
while he gets to deny
the whole thing and walk away.

08:32.331 --> 08:35.431
You... You mean you want us
to take it back to Tony?

08:35.631 --> 08:38.831
No, I'll take it back to Tony,
with a message.

08:40.131 --> 08:42.530
- Now, where you goin'?
- School.

08:42.831 --> 08:44.531
- Why?
- To get educated?

08:44.831 --> 08:46.631
- Why?
- So we can go to college.

08:46.731 --> 08:48.831
- And why is that important?
- To get "espect."

08:49.131 --> 08:50.931
"Respect."
And who's the bad guys?

08:51.231 --> 08:53.831
- Guys who sell drugs.
- Guys who have guns.

08:54.031 --> 08:55.831
- And who's the good guys?
- We're the good guys.

08:56.031 --> 08:57.931
- Who's gonna help you?
- Nobody.

08:58.131 --> 09:00.331
- So who's gonna help you?
- We're gonna help ourselves.

09:00.631 --> 09:02.931
- And who do we not want to help us?
- White people.
- White people.

09:03.231 --> 09:05.731
That's right.

09:05.931 --> 09:09.231
Now, get on outta here.
Go to school.

09:13.231 --> 09:15.431
- Uncle, you better come look at this.
- What?

09:15.631 --> 09:17.631
There's a white man
standing in the street.

09:17.831 --> 09:20.531
- I seen one.
- Not like this.

09:30.431 --> 09:32.931
Dial 9-1-1. Tell the police
to get up here quick.

09:33.331 --> 09:37.931
Somebody's about to get killed. And get
your butts to school. You hear me?

09:38.231 --> 09:40.432
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- All right.

09:44.432 --> 09:47.432
- I paid 500 bucks...
- You better back off, man.

09:56.432 --> 09:59.132
- Hey, man!
- He ain't so big.

10:05.932 --> 10:09.332
- Morning.
- Good morning.

10:09.632 --> 10:12.932
You having a nice day, sir?
You feeling all right?

10:13.232 --> 10:15.032
Not to get too personal...

10:15.332 --> 10:17.132
but a white man standin'
in the middle of Harlem...

10:17.332 --> 10:19.632
wearin' a sign that says
"I hate niggers"...

10:19.932 --> 10:21.932
has either got some serious
personal issues...

10:22.232 --> 10:24.632
or not all his dogs are barkin'.

10:24.832 --> 10:27.332
Hey, I'm talkin' to you!

10:27.532 --> 10:30.132
Now, you got about ten seconds
before those guys see you.

10:30.432 --> 10:33.132
When they do, they will kill you.
You understand?

10:33.432 --> 10:37.032
You are about to have
a very bad day.

10:37.332 --> 10:40.832
Tell me about it.
Sir, this is a police matter.

10:41.132 --> 10:43.632
- For your own safety, I'm gonna
ask you to step across the street.
- You damn right it's a police matter!

10:43.832 --> 10:46.632
For your own safety, I suggest
you hide your butt in my shop
till the police get here.

10:46.932 --> 10:49.032
What the fuck?

10:50.632 --> 10:53.233
Aw, shit.

11:00.033 --> 11:01.733
- Listen, I'm a cop. I'm on a case.
- What?

11:02.033 --> 11:04.233
Somebody blew up
Bonwit Teller's an hour ago.
Did you hear about that on the news?

11:04.433 --> 11:06.233
- Yeah.
- The same asshole that did that said...

11:06.433 --> 11:08.233
I gotta come to Harlem and do this
or he's gonna blow up something else.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.133
- Do you understand?
- Shit, shit, shit.

11:10.433 --> 11:12.133
- Listen, I got a gun.
You should get across the street.
- They got ten guns.

11:12.433 --> 11:14.233
- You should get across the street!
- Look, start acting crazy, all right?

11:14.433 --> 11:16.733
- What?
- Like Looney Tunes.
You know, like Bellevue?

11:17.033 --> 11:21.333
- Hey, Zeus, this a friend of yours?
- He look like a friend of mine?

11:21.633 --> 11:25.533
I think the dude just escaped from
some hospital. You know, like Bellevue?

11:29.933 --> 11:33.933
I am the voice of my own god.

11:34.233 --> 11:36.233
And my god did...

11:36.533 --> 11:38.633
I told the librarian that I had a bad
headache, but she didn't believe me.

11:38.833 --> 11:41.533
I really do have a bad headache, though.
I have a very bad headache!

11:41.833 --> 11:45.133
- And my head does not feel...
- Oh, man, shut the fuck...

11:45.533 --> 11:47.433
- Who in the fuck...
- You've made a very bad mistake.
- Kick his ass.

11:47.633 --> 11:50.333
- Put it through his head.
- Bust his head.

11:50.533 --> 11:54.033
Cut this shit off!
Fellas! Fellas!

11:54.333 --> 11:57.533
Nature boy here hates niggers.
Now, what are we gonna do about that?

11:57.833 --> 12:00.433
- Fight him!
- Yo, yo, yo, yo!
Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!

12:00.733 --> 12:03.434
- Oh, shit!
- Yeah!

12:03.634 --> 12:05.734
Get him! Get him!

12:05.934 --> 12:08.834
- Back! Back up!
- Hey, what you trippin' on?

12:09.034 --> 12:12.234
- Back the fuck up! Now!
- Hey, you better quit that, boy!

12:12.634 --> 12:16.034
Come on, man, get up.
Get up! Get outta here!

12:17.734 --> 12:19.634
Stop the c...
Stop the goddam cab!

12:19.934 --> 12:22.034
- Don't shoot!
No, don't shoot me! Don't shoot!
- Don't move that cab! Get up!

12:22.334 --> 12:24.134
- Come on, get up!
- Yo, you sayin' you gonna kill us?

12:24.334 --> 12:27.934
I mean it! I don't want to, but I will!
You know I will! Come on. Drive! Drive!

12:28.234 --> 12:30.734
- Drive! Go! Go! Go! Drive, goddam it!
-  Get the fuck outta here!

12:30.934 --> 12:34.034
Drive! Drive!
Don't stop! Don't stop!

12:34.434 --> 12:36.734
- Just keep driving!
Run the red light! Drive!
- Don't shoot me, man! That's all I got!

12:36.934 --> 12:38.734
- That's all I got.
- Man, put that fuckin' money away!

12:38.934 --> 12:40.734
- Nobody's robbing you, asshole!
- Don't kill me!
- Nobody's gonna kill you!

12:40.934 --> 12:42.634
- Shit!
- Just run all the lights! Drive!

12:42.934 --> 12:44.834
- Oh, man! Damn!
- We got a bus.

12:45.034 --> 12:46.834
- That cut deep?
- How the hell would I know?

12:47.034 --> 12:49.134
Just keep pressure on it.

12:49.434 --> 12:51.634
Oh, fuck!

12:51.934 --> 12:55.334
- Jesus, right? John McClane.
I owe you one.
- Damn right, you owe me!

12:55.634 --> 12:58.434
- You got any idea what those guys
are doin' to my shop right now?
- Chill out, Jesus!

12:58.734 --> 13:00.534
- We'll send a car for...
- "Chill out"? What the fuck?
Are you tryin' to relate to me?

13:00.734 --> 13:02.834
- Talk like a white man!
- Okay. Jesus, I'm sorry
you got involved, all right?

13:03.134 --> 13:05.134
Why do you keep calling me Jesus?
I look Puerto Rican to you?

13:05.334 --> 13:07.634
- Guy back there
called you Jesus, didn't he?
- He didn't say Jesus!

13:07.834 --> 13:10.834
- He said, "Hey, Zeus." My name is Zeus.
- Zeus?

13:11.134 --> 13:14.035
Yeah, Zeus! As in father of Apollo!
Mount Olympus!

13:14.235 --> 13:17.035
"Don't fuck with me, or I'll shove
a lightning bolt up your ass!"

13:17.235 --> 13:20.235
Zeus! You got a problem with that?

13:20.535 --> 13:23.035
- No, I don't have a problem with that.
- Shit!

13:23.335 --> 13:27.035
- Downtown. Police Plaza.
- That's just great.

13:32.235 --> 13:33.935
Get a record of all his collars,
recent releases...

13:34.235 --> 13:36.135
and a list of anybody else
he might have looked at sideways.

13:36.435 --> 13:38.535
It's probably as long as your arm,
so I'm gonna need some help with it.

13:38.835 --> 13:41.635
It's textbook megalomania.
It's a pathological state...

13:41.835 --> 13:45.035
in which fantasies of control
or omnipotence predominate.

13:45.335 --> 13:48.835
He wants control over him.
He wants control over his actions,
over his thoughts, even his emotions.

13:49.035 --> 13:52.635
- Sounds like you got
a secret admirer, John.
- Yeah, maybe he'll send me some flowers.

13:52.935 --> 13:56.235
- Everybody knows you like pansies.
- It's not tha0 kind o- emotion.

13:56.435 --> 13:58.635
- This guy is ugly.
- How is that?

13:58.835 --> 14:01.535
Nothin' wrong with him
a shower wouldn't cure.

14:01.735 --> 14:04.135
Beer is normally taken
internally, John.

14:04.535 --> 14:07.535
- Just get me some aspirins, will ya?
- Yeah, okay. Hold this here.

14:08.835 --> 14:10.635
This is Fred Schiller, John,
and he's a...

14:10.835 --> 14:14.435
- A shrink. Yeah, I got it.
- Yes. I was saying that we're dealing...

14:14.735 --> 14:17.735
with a megalomaniacal personality
with possible paranoid schizophrenia.

14:17.935 --> 14:21.935
Hey, hey, how about we just skip down
to the part where you tell me what
the fuck this has to do with me, huh?

14:22.335 --> 14:26.136
I don't know. I mean,
what I do know is it does have
specifically to do with you.

14:26.436 --> 14:29.636
This guy wants to pound on you
till you crumble.

14:29.936 --> 14:31.736
He wants you to dance
to his tune and then...

14:31.936 --> 14:34.836
Put on a dress and fuck me?

14:35.036 --> 14:37.136
I was going to say kill you.

14:37.336 --> 14:40.036
- Pick up five, goddam it!
- He's sitting on an awful lot of rage...

14:40.336 --> 14:43.536
and it could be manifested physically
if he's stressed.

14:43.936 --> 14:46.036
Somebody he arrested?
Somebody he pissed off?

14:46.336 --> 14:48.936
- That could be one hell of a long list.
- Fuck you, Joe.

14:49.236 --> 14:51.336
See, these people don't like
to work anonymously.

14:51.536 --> 14:53.836
They want you to know
who's doing it to you.

14:54.036 --> 14:55.836
So this name "Simon"
is probably not an alias.

14:56.136 --> 14:58.336
It's probably "Simon"
or some variation.

14:58.636 --> 15:02.436
"Simon, Robert E. Busted in '86,
extortion, kidnapping, ten to fifteen.

15:02.736 --> 15:06.036
Did seven years for good behaviour.
Released on a state work-furlough
two months ago."

15:06.436 --> 15:08.236
- Check it.
- Thanks, Rick.

15:08.436 --> 15:11.736
Bob Simons was a bankrupt businessman
who kidnapped his partner's daughter.

15:11.936 --> 15:14.736
He's a fuckup, not a psycho.
The guy we're lookin' for is nuts.

15:14.936 --> 15:17.736
A nut who knows a lot about bombs.

15:18.036 --> 15:20.636
We found this in a playground.
Professional!

15:20.936 --> 15:23.836
Very cool stuff.
You know, boom!

15:24.036 --> 15:27.836
- You think you should
slam it around like that, Charlie?
- When it's unmixed, you can't hurt it.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.636
This stuff is cutting edge.
It's a binary liquid.

15:30.836 --> 15:33.636
- A what?
- Like epoxy.

15:33.836 --> 15:35.636
Two liquids.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.437
Either one by itself...

15:39.937 --> 15:43.137
you got nothin', but mix 'em...

15:54.537 --> 15:56.237
Ricky.

16:00.537 --> 16:02.937
Charlie, you're gonna be wearing
that shirt up your ass!

16:03.237 --> 16:06.337
- Christ Almighty, Charlie!
- Like I said, very cool stuff.

16:06.637 --> 16:08.937
Now, with a package like this,
you get a warning.

16:09.237 --> 16:11.137
Now, the bomb has to arm itself.

16:11.437 --> 16:15.537
You'll see the red liquid
pump into the clear before it detonates.

16:15.737 --> 16:18.937
- How long before?
- Ten seconds, two minutes.

16:19.237 --> 16:21.037
Could be anything.

16:21.237 --> 16:24.537
But once it's mixed,
be somewhere else.

16:24.737 --> 16:26.537
This stuff has gotta be pretty rare.

16:26.737 --> 16:28.537
We oughta be able to find out
if any of it's missin' somewhere.

16:28.837 --> 16:31.737
I already did. Livermore Labs
theft over the weekend.

16:32.037 --> 16:34.137
He got enough to make
another one, Joe?

16:34.337 --> 16:37.337
- About 2,000 pounds.
- Of that?

16:37.637 --> 16:40.837
Well, the detonating mechanism
could be anything... radio, electrical.

16:41.137 --> 16:43.437
Hell, you could use a beeper
and phone it in.

16:43.737 --> 16:47.737
- Inspector? Inspector, it's him.
- He's got a double Alberti
feedback loop on it.

16:48.037 --> 16:50.838
- A nasty little trick
I believe once used in Lebanon.
- Charlie. Charlie!

16:51.038 --> 16:52.538
- Charlie, shh!
- What?

16:52.738 --> 16:54.538
Wanna start the trace?

17:01.838 --> 17:03.138
Simon.

17:03.438 --> 17:06.338
He wore the board,
walked the street and survived.

17:07.938 --> 17:11.738
- Where are my pigeons now?
- Pigeons?

17:11.938 --> 17:15.338
I had two pigeons, bright and gay,
fly from me the other day.

17:15.738 --> 17:18.938
Why was it they did go?
You cannot tell. You do not know.

17:19.137 --> 17:22.838
- You mean McClane?
- No, I mean Santa Claus.

17:25.538 --> 17:29.738
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Ah, there after all. And your friend?

17:30.038 --> 17:32.538
Carver! Carver! Come on.
We need you in the other room.

17:32.738 --> 17:35.938
- Let's go! Come on!
- They need you. Go.

17:36.238 --> 17:38.938
- Yeah, he's here too.
- And may I speak with him?

17:41.238 --> 17:43.338
Well, is the ebony
Samaritan there now?

17:43.538 --> 17:45.938
- You got a problem with ebony?
- No, no.

17:46.238 --> 17:50.238
My only problem is that I went to some
trouble preparing that game for McClane.

17:50.638 --> 17:52.738
You interfered
with a well-laid plan.

17:52.938 --> 17:56.938
Yeah? Well, you can stick your
well-laid plan up your well-laid ass.

17:59.538 --> 18:03.439
That was not smart.
There are lives at stake here!

18:03.739 --> 18:07.139
- Not enough time, Inspector.
- You better hope he calls back.

18:07.339 --> 18:08.839
He will.

18:11.139 --> 18:14.039
Ricky, you wanna tell those people
to shut the hell up out there!

18:14.239 --> 18:17.039
Hey, keep it down here!

18:25.239 --> 18:28.539
Simon, he wasn't speaking
for all of us.

18:28.839 --> 18:32.039
That was unpleasant.
Don't let it happen again.

18:32.239 --> 18:35.339
- So, what's your name, boy?
- Don't call me "boy."

18:35.639 --> 18:38.839
I'm sorry.
It was a poor attempt at humour.

18:39.039 --> 18:41.139
I was going to send you home
with a chiding...

18:41.439 --> 18:44.039
- but now I think perhaps
you should join the game.
- We got him!

18:44.239 --> 18:46.239
It's a pay phone in Oslo.

18:46.439 --> 18:48.239
- No, w-wait, they say
it's Juarez, Mexico.
- Norway?

18:48.439 --> 18:51.039
No, wait. No, wait. N-Now
they're saying it's Juarez, Mexico.

18:51.239 --> 18:54.639
Forget it! Australia?
He's scrambling up their system.
They don't know where he is.

18:55.039 --> 18:57.839
Having fun with
the phone company, are we?

18:58.039 --> 19:00.739
Simon says,
McClane and the Samaritan...

19:00.939 --> 19:03.739
will go to the subway station
at 72nd and Broadway.

19:03.939 --> 19:07.139
I will call you in 15 minutes
on the pay phone outside the station.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.939
No police. Failure to answer
will constitute noncompliance.

19:11.239 --> 19:13.540
Do you understand me, John?

19:13.840 --> 19:16.840
Oh, yes, I understand. I understand
that you're a fuckin' wacko...

19:17.240 --> 19:19.240
that likes to play kids games,
that's what I understand.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.240
- Hardly.
- Hardly?

19:21.340 --> 19:24.540
Well, then, who are you?
Somebody I sent up? What'd you do?

19:24.840 --> 19:28.840
Shoplifting? Purse snatching?
Cross dressing? What?

19:29.240 --> 19:33.340
You c-c-couldn't catch me if I stole
your ch-chair with you in it.

19:33.540 --> 19:37.240
My ch-ch-ch-chair with me in it?
Ooh-hoo! That's very exciting.

19:37.640 --> 19:41.340
Let me ask you a question, bonehead.
Why are you trying to k-k-k-kill me?

19:41.640 --> 19:44.640
- John, John, calm yourself.
- Why don't you come on
down here to Police Plaza...

19:44.840 --> 19:46.640
and we'll figure this out
like a couple of men, huh?

19:46.940 --> 19:49.840
- Just come on down here.
- If killing you was all I wanted...

19:50.040 --> 19:52.440
- Simon, this is Inspector Cobb.
- you'd be dead by now.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.240
I can appreciate your feelings
for McClane...

19:55.440 --> 19:58.040
but believe me,
the jerk isn't worth it.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.440
He's stepped on so many toes
in this department...

20:00.640 --> 20:03.040
by this time next month
he's gonna be a security guard.

20:03.440 --> 20:05.440
His own wife wants
nothing to do with him...

20:05.540 --> 20:08.540
and he's about two steps shy
of becoming a full-blown alcoholic.

20:08.940 --> 20:11.340
One step. One step.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.340
Now listen to me.

20:13.640 --> 20:17.240
You sound like a real smart guy.
What is it that you want?

20:17.440 --> 20:19.440
Are you talking about money?

20:19.640 --> 20:22.240
Well, whatever, whatever.

20:22.540 --> 20:25.041
McClane is a toilet bug.

20:25.241 --> 20:28.541
Now what would it take just to forget
him and live happily ever after?

20:28.941 --> 20:30.741
You know, money is shit to me.

20:30.941 --> 20:35.041
I would not give up McClane
for all the gold in your Fort Knox.

20:35.341 --> 20:38.341
72nd Street subway,
pay phone, 15 minutes.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.441
McClane and the Samaritan.

20:40.641 --> 20:43.141
If you're competent in the least,
you've found the briefcase...

20:43.441 --> 20:46.241
so you know what I mean by penalty.

20:49.241 --> 20:51.241
I wanna thank you for that vote
of confidence, Walter.

20:51.541 --> 20:54.341
Well, I thought it was worth a try.
This guy's a raving maniac.

20:54.741 --> 20:57.241
Well, he-he couldn't be any clearer
if he got it from a case history.

20:57.441 --> 20:59.341
He gave you clues
to his identity.

20:59.641 --> 21:02.341
He spoke German.
He called it "your Fort Knox."

21:02.641 --> 21:04.341
And he stammered
when McClane pushed him.

21:04.541 --> 21:06.541
Now, you believe this guy
really can't be bought?

21:06.741 --> 21:10.741
There's no chance. The very mention
of money only enraged him further.

21:18.941 --> 21:22.241
- What's that?
- It's your shield.

21:22.541 --> 21:24.841
- You askin' me to be
a cop again, Walter?
- Ricky, get him his gun, all right?

21:25.141 --> 21:28.841
- You didn't answer my question. Hey!
- Joe, this time they...

21:29.141 --> 21:33.541
- You didn't answer my question, Walter.
- Are you done, Lieutenant?

21:35.242 --> 21:38.342
Now, you two better get going if you're
going to get up to 72nd Street on time.

21:38.642 --> 21:41.142
- Joe, this time they go with backup.
- You got it.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.942
- Come on, you guys!
- I'm not goin' anywhere.

21:44.142 --> 21:48.142
- Simon says you gotta go!
- I'm not jumpin' through hoops
for some psycho!

21:48.542 --> 21:51.042
That's a white man with white problems.
You deal with him.

21:51.242 --> 21:56.042
- Call me when he crosses 110th Street.
- Hey! Why'd you save my ass?

21:56.342 --> 22:00.142
I didn't. I stopped a white cop
from gettin' killed in Harlem.

22:00.442 --> 22:02.242
One white cop gets killed today...

22:02.542 --> 22:05.942
tomorrow we got a thousand white cops,
all of 'em with itchy trigger fingers.

22:06.242 --> 22:10.442
- Got it?
- Get him back.

22:13.042 --> 22:15.142
- Charlie, where'd you find that bomb?
- Chinatown.

22:15.442 --> 22:17.342
Shit.

22:17.442 --> 22:20.242
Zeus! Yo, partner! Wait up!

22:20.542 --> 22:22.342
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I ain't your partner.

22:22.642 --> 22:26.142
I ain't your neighbour, your brother
or your friend. I'm your total stranger.

22:27.342 --> 22:29.442
Okay, stranger...

22:29.742 --> 22:32.842
you know where that park is
at 115th Street and St Nicholas?

22:35.542 --> 22:39.042
- Yeah, it's in Harlem.
- Where do you think
we found that bomb?

22:39.342 --> 22:44.442
Listen, this guy doesn't care
about skin colour, even if you do.

22:47.043 --> 22:50.643
- What am I doin'?
- Cheer up. Things could be worse.

22:50.943 --> 22:53.043
I was workin'
on a nice, fat suspension...

22:53.243 --> 22:55.243
smokin' cigarettes
and watchin' Captain Kangaroo.

22:56.143 --> 22:57.643
Come on.

23:00.943 --> 23:02.743
Is that the phone?

23:06.643 --> 23:08.743
Okay, they made it to the phone,
but there's a problem.

23:08.843 --> 23:10.743
Well, what do you mean?
How big a problem?

23:11.043 --> 23:12.943
Oh, about 300 pounds.

23:13.143 --> 23:15.143
- And they're probably going to end up
having to get an operation.
- Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.

23:15.343 --> 23:17.143
- We need this phone
for official police business.
- Do you mind!

23:17.443 --> 23:19.143
- Honey, I'm a cop.
I need the phone right now.
- I'm sorry, but I can no...

23:19.443 --> 23:21.743
Get off the damn phone, lady!
Police business!

23:21.943 --> 23:24.243
- Well, I never!
- I can get used to this.

23:24.443 --> 23:27.043
I'm sure you can find a phone
across the street, ma'am.

23:27.243 --> 23:29.843
Let's get something straight.
I'm the only one here
on official police business.

23:30.043 --> 23:32.643
- Don't ever do that shit again.
- Let's get somethin' else straight.

23:32.843 --> 23:34.943
You need me
a lot more than I need you.

23:35.243 --> 23:38.043
You don't like the way
I do things, fine. I quit.

23:41.543 --> 23:43.343
I don't know.

23:47.043 --> 23:49.343
All right, I need you.

23:54.843 --> 23:57.944
All right, I need you
more than you need me.

24:02.144 --> 24:05.444
- Hello!
- Birds of a feather flock together.
So do pigs and swine.

24:05.844 --> 24:08.744
Rats and mice have their chance,
as will I have mine.

24:08.944 --> 24:10.744
Nice. Rhymes.

24:11.044 --> 24:14.544
- Why was the phone busy?
Who were you calling?
- The Psychic Hotline.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.544
I'd advise you to take this
more seriously.

24:16.744 --> 24:18.544
Look, it's a public phone!
What do you want me to say?

24:18.744 --> 24:22.744
You can simply say
there was a fat woman on it, and it
took you a minute to get her off!

24:24.344 --> 24:27.744
Now, John, there's a significant
amount of explosive...

24:28.144 --> 24:29.944
in the trash receptacle next to you.

24:31.744 --> 24:34.044
Try to run,
and it goes up now.

24:34.344 --> 24:36.344
Nobody's gonna run, but I got
a hundred people out here!

24:36.644 --> 24:40.144
That's the point.
Now, do I have your attention?

24:40.544 --> 24:42.944
As I was going to St Ives,
I met a man with seven wives.

24:43.244 --> 24:45.744
Every wife had seven sacks.
Every sack had seven cats.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.344
Every cat had seven kittens.
Kittens, cats, sacks and wives.

24:48.644 --> 24:51.844
How many were going to St Ives?
My phone number is 555...

24:52.144 --> 24:54.844
- No, no, no! Wait! I didn't
get all that! Say it again!
- Not a chance.

24:55.144 --> 24:58.144
- My phone number is 555 and the answer.
- But I didn't...

24:58.344 --> 25:00.544
Call me in 30 seconds or die.

25:03.644 --> 25:06.044
- All right,
seven guys with seven wives makes...
- Shut up, McClane. I'm good at this.

25:06.444 --> 25:09.845
- Seven guys with seven wives makes...
- Shut the fuck up, McClane!
He said seven wives with seven sacks.

25:10.045 --> 25:12.445
- Seven times seven is 49.
Now tell me the rest.
- Seven wives?

25:12.745 --> 25:14.745
- A sack with...
s-seven sacks with seven...
- Weren't you listening?

25:15.045 --> 25:16.945
- Yeah, I was listening.
I didn't hear every fuckin' thing...
- What the heck is wrong with you?

25:17.145 --> 25:19.845
- Well, I... Besides having
a bad fuckin' hangover, for one thing!
- All right, all right, all right.

25:20.045 --> 25:22.145
Seven wives times seven, 49.
With seven cats.

25:22.345 --> 25:24.445
Seven times 49 is 343, right?

25:24.645 --> 25:27.945
- What, are you asking me or telling me?
- I'm telling you. 343 times seven is...

25:28.245 --> 25:32.145
One, zero, 24. 2,401.
That's what you got, right?

25:32.345 --> 25:34.345
Yeah, that's what I got.
Is that it, 2,401?

25:34.545 --> 25:37.845
- That's it. Dial. 555-2401.
- 555-2401.

25:39.445 --> 25:42.245
- No, wait, wait!
It's a trick. It's a trick.
- What? What? What do you mean?

25:42.545 --> 25:45.045
- I forgot about the man.
- What man? Fuck the man!
We got ten seconds left!

25:45.345 --> 25:47.445
He said how many were going
to St Ives, right?

25:47.545 --> 25:50.845
The riddle begins: As I was going to
St Ives, I met a man with seven wives.

25:51.245 --> 25:54.045
- The guy and his wives
aren't goin' anywhere.
- What are they doing?

25:54.245 --> 25:56.745
Sittin' in the fuckin' road
waitin' on a mo...
How the hell should I know, McClane?

25:56.945 --> 26:00.245
- Well, who's going to St Ives then?
- The guy. Just the guy.

26:00.645 --> 26:02.545
- Just one guy? Just one guy.
- The answer's one.

26:02.745 --> 26:05.245
- How do you dial one?
- 555-0001.

26:05.545 --> 26:08.245
- Zero, zero, one. Just one guy's going?
- Hello, John.

26:08.445 --> 26:10.745
Yeah, piece of cake.
Give us somethin' harder next time.

26:10.945 --> 26:13.545
- But you're ten seconds late.
- No, no! The answer is one! The...

26:13.745 --> 26:16.245
- Boom!
- There's a bomb in the trash! Get down!
- Everybody, get down!

26:16.445 --> 26:19.545
Get down! There's a bomb!
Everybody, get down!

26:19.845 --> 26:22.246
There's a bomb!

26:22.446 --> 26:24.946
Get down! There's a bomb!

26:28.046 --> 26:30.246
- Welcome to New York.
- Really.

26:32.346 --> 26:35.746
They were just talking.
Here, you can have it. Come on.

26:35.946 --> 26:38.146
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm getting outta here right now.

26:46.146 --> 26:49.046
- I told you it wasn't a bomb.
- I thought there was a bomb!

26:52.446 --> 26:54.346
No bomb.

27:00.346 --> 27:03.646
- Yeah.
- I didn't say "Simon says."

27:03.946 --> 27:08.546
It's 9:50,John.
The number 3 train is arriving now.

27:08.846 --> 27:12.046
I left something provocative
on that train, John.

27:12.346 --> 27:14.546
Simon says,
get to the pay phone...

27:14.746 --> 27:17.946
next to the news kiosk
in Wall Street Station by 10:20...

27:18.246 --> 27:21.346
- Half an hour.
- or the number 3 train
and its passengers vaporize.

27:21.646 --> 27:24.946
Use any means of travel
other than civilian, I blow the train.

27:25.246 --> 27:27.646
Attempt to evacuate the subway,
I blow the train.

27:28.046 --> 27:30.746
I'll call you in 30 minutes.
Be there.

27:32.647 --> 27:34.347
- We're fucked.
- Ninety blocks in 30 minutes?

27:34.547 --> 27:38.047
In New York traffic?
It could be double that.

27:38.347 --> 27:40.947
We don't even have a car!

27:41.147 --> 27:43.147
Hey! Hey! Sir! Sir!
I'm a cop! I'm a cop!

27:43.347 --> 27:45.747
- I am requisitioning this car
for official police business.
- Hey, what are you doing?

27:46.047 --> 27:48.447
- Thank you very much. Get in! Get in!
- What the fuck you doing to my car?
- Pretty slick.

27:48.747 --> 27:51.947
Listen, I used to drive a cab.
The fastest way south is...

27:52.347 --> 27:54.747
What the fuck are you doing?

27:59.647 --> 28:03.747
- What were you sayin'?
- I was saying I used to drive a cab.

28:03.947 --> 28:07.847
Ninth Avenue is the fastest way south.
But we seem to be going east.

28:14.147 --> 28:17.047
Where the hell are you going, McClane?
I told you Ninth Avenue
was the quickest way south!

28:17.447 --> 28:20.947
- Stop with that goddam yelling!
I know what I'm doing!
- Not even God knows what you're doing!

28:21.247 --> 28:23.747
They're headed east on 72nd
towards the park.

28:24.047 --> 28:27.147
- But Wall Street is south!
- Man, stop yelling at me!
I got a bad headache!

28:27.447 --> 28:30.647
And the best way south is not
Ninth Avenue, it's through the park.

28:32.347 --> 28:34.647
Oh, dear.

28:34.847 --> 28:36.947
I told you the park drive
is always jammed.

28:37.147 --> 28:39.747
I didn't say park drive.

28:41.647 --> 28:43.547
I said through the park.

28:46.448 --> 28:49.048
Shit! We lost 'em.
They're in the park headed south.

28:50.448 --> 28:53.848
- Get outta here!
- Fucking prick!

28:59.748 --> 29:02.848
I got him, Connie.
He's taking the scenic route.

29:03.248 --> 29:05.548
- Outta the way!
- Oh, man.

29:08.248 --> 29:10.248
Get out! Get outta there!

29:14.648 --> 29:16.448
Watch it, watch it, watch it,
watch it! Oh, my God!

29:16.648 --> 29:18.448
Are you... Are you aiming
for these people?

29:18.648 --> 29:21.048
No. Well, maybe that mime.

29:21.248 --> 29:24.348
Tree! Tree! Tree!

29:27.748 --> 29:31.348
What's goin' on here?

29:33.748 --> 29:35.848
Look out!

29:37.148 --> 29:40.148
- Tree! Tree!
- Just hang on.

29:40.448 --> 29:43.048
Rock! Rock! Rock!

29:48.248 --> 29:51.348
Hey, look out down there!

29:51.548 --> 29:55.248
McClane! McClane, watch it.

29:58.549 --> 30:01.449
McClane!

30:07.049 --> 30:09.349
Come on! Outta the way!

30:09.549 --> 30:12.049
- How do Catholics do their thing?
- North, south, west, east.

30:13.049 --> 30:14.949
- How much time?
- Twenty-seven minutes.

30:15.149 --> 30:18.449
Ha! 72nd and Broadway
to Central Park South in three minutes!

30:20.049 --> 30:22.049
That's gotta be a fuckin' record.

30:22.349 --> 30:24.949
Come on, get out...

30:25.149 --> 30:27.749
Yeah. Now what?

30:34.449 --> 30:36.649
- We need a fire truck.
- What?

30:36.949 --> 30:38.749
To follow.

30:42.349 --> 30:44.549
- 9-1-1.
- Lt John McClane, NYPD.

30:44.749 --> 30:47.549
Access number 7479.
Calling from a civilian transmitter.

30:47.849 --> 30:50.949
- Get me an emergency
dispatcher right away.
- Dispatch. Go ahead.

30:51.249 --> 30:53.649
I got two officers down at the corner
of 14th Street and Ninth Avenue!

30:53.849 --> 30:55.949
Need an ambulance! Over!

30:56.249 --> 30:59.149
Emergency calls on the west side
go to Roosevelt Hospital.
That's two blocks from here.

31:26.850 --> 31:29.750
- Slow the fuck down, McClane!
- Kinda like football, isn't it?

31:30.050 --> 31:33.250
- What?
- Get yourself a blocker
and head for the end zone!

31:36.350 --> 31:38.650
If you'd said Wall Street,
we could've followed him all the way.

31:38.850 --> 31:41.050
Wrong! South of 14th Street's
a different hospital!

31:41.250 --> 31:44.050
St Luke's. Hang on.

31:53.550 --> 31:56.450
- Time?
- 10:02.

31:56.750 --> 31:59.050
We're halfway there
with 18 minutes to go.

31:59.350 --> 32:01.150
Fuck this! Hang on.

32:14.450 --> 32:17.750
Hang on. Get outta there!
Slide over and take the wheel.

32:17.950 --> 32:20.051
- Where you goin'?
- We should be ahead
of that train, right?

32:20.251 --> 32:23.351
- You're not gonna get on that train...
- I'm gonna get on that train! You gotta
get to that pay phone by 10:20!

32:23.651 --> 32:25.451
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna get that bomb.

32:25.651 --> 32:28.251
Listen, you fail, I cover your ass.
I fail, you cover my ass.

32:28.651 --> 32:31.951
- And if we both fail?
- Then we're both fucked.

32:32.151 --> 32:35.651
Go now! Drive! Get to that
phone booth by 10:20! Go!

32:35.951 --> 32:38.351
My lucky fuckin' day.

32:41.751 --> 32:44.251
Shit! Look out, ma'am!

32:46.751 --> 32:50.351
Look out! Look out! Look out!
Get outta the way!

32:56.651 --> 32:59.051
This is a bad idea!

33:25.651 --> 33:27.351
Excuse me! Excuse me!

33:27.551 --> 33:30.552
Just get outta the way, please!

33:43.352 --> 33:47.352
- 112 Wall Street.
- Wait. This isn't a taxi.
You don't understand.

33:47.652 --> 33:49.852
Your light's on.
I'll make it simple.

33:50.152 --> 33:53.252
112 Wall Street, or I'll have
your medallion suspended.

33:53.552 --> 33:56.552
What, you don't like
white people?

33:56.852 --> 34:01.352
112 Wall Street?
You got it.

34:05.352 --> 34:07.152
Come on.

34:10.152 --> 34:13.152
Fuck!
Move your legs, sir.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.952
Get your legs outta the way!
Sorry. Sorry.

34:28.952 --> 34:31.652
- Hey! Excuse me!
- 1823405...

34:40.952 --> 34:42.753
Hey!

34:58.553 --> 34:59.753
Shit!

35:01.153 --> 35:03.153
Excuse me! Watch out!
Excuse me, sir.

35:03.453 --> 35:05.453
Pardon me, please. Excu...

35:08.053 --> 35:09.853
- Will you step outta here for a minute.
- What?

35:10.053 --> 35:13.253
I'm a cop. Step out of here
for a minute, please. Will ya?

35:40.153 --> 35:42.453
Excuse me, please!
Let me get through here, please!

35:42.653 --> 35:46.653
- It's him.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Pardon.

35:46.953 --> 35:49.953
Excuse me, sir, but I'm expecting
a call. I need that phone.

35:50.153 --> 35:52.753
Why don't you use
the other phone?

35:57.054 --> 36:00.354
Sir, please.
I need to use that phone.

36:00.754 --> 36:03.354
Hey, listen, bro,
I was here first.

36:03.554 --> 36:07.254
"Bro"? Get away
from the goddam phone!

36:07.554 --> 36:10.054
Put your hands up!

36:26.154 --> 36:29.954
- I have to answer that phone.
- Just shut up and get 'em in the air!

36:30.254 --> 36:33.654
Watch it! Excuse me! Pardon me!
Watch, watch your back! Watch it!

36:33.954 --> 36:36.154
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm a New York police officer.

36:36.354 --> 36:40.254
I'm gonna ask you to calmly
and quietly start moving towards
the other end of the car.

36:40.554 --> 36:43.454
Go now, please! Go now!

36:43.754 --> 36:46.654
Fuck! Let's go!
Watch it! Watch out!

36:46.854 --> 36:49.454
Watch... Watch it! Go!

36:52.454 --> 36:55.754
I have to answer that phone.

36:55.954 --> 36:58.254
Get 'em up!

36:58.454 --> 37:01.554
Look, if you have to shoot me...

37:01.954 --> 37:04.855
then you go ahead
and you shoot me!

37:05.055 --> 37:09.455
But I have to answer this phone,
all right?

37:14.955 --> 37:18.555
- I'm here.
- And McClane?

37:18.955 --> 37:22.055
He's on his way. Uh, you know, he's
a little slow. He's kinda out of shape.

37:22.255 --> 37:26.755
The rules applied to both of you.
I'm afraid this is noncompliance.

37:27.055 --> 37:28.955
Goodbye.

37:35.755 --> 37:40.055
Trust me, guys. Duck.

38:17.056 --> 38:19.756
Hey, get outta there!
Get outta there! Duck, asshole!

38:43.956 --> 38:45.756
Oh, my God!

39:11.556 --> 39:12.856
McClane?

39:19.856 --> 39:21.156
What?

39:25.656 --> 39:29.057
- You can see right down into the subway.
- How many fire trucks do you count?

39:29.357 --> 39:32.157
- You guys! You guys!
- How can you see it from up here?

39:32.957 --> 39:34.757
Damn! Get in there.

39:35.057 --> 39:38.757
Officer, tell those people
to get the hell back, will ya?

39:39.057 --> 39:41.457
We got a shitload of cuts and bruises,
a couple concussions...

39:41.757 --> 39:44.257
some old guy's pacemaker stopped,
and a pregnant girl's water broke.

39:44.557 --> 39:46.557
And that's all.
How're you doin', John?

39:46.857 --> 39:48.957
Still can't hear too good.

39:49.157 --> 39:52.157
Well, it's a miracle you're still alive.
It's a goddam miracle.

39:52.357 --> 39:54.657
- Yeah, that's the problem, Joe.
- What?

39:54.857 --> 39:58.557
The miracle part. What are the odds
of us makin' it down here on time?

39:59.957 --> 40:02.057
- Zip.
- That bomb was gonna go off
no matter what.

40:02.357 --> 40:04.457
He wanted it to go off
right down here.

40:04.657 --> 40:07.057
Take this off me, Dave.

40:07.457 --> 40:09.557
Well, what's so special
about this place?

40:09.757 --> 40:12.257
- I don't know.
Something just doesn't add up.
- Lt McClane?

40:12.657 --> 40:15.157
They're asking for you and a Mr Carver.

40:18.457 --> 40:19.757
- Where?
- John?

40:21.757 --> 40:25.657
John, this is Andy Cross
with the FBI.

40:26.057 --> 40:29.957
- This is Mr Jarvis. He's...
- I'm, uh, with another agency.

40:30.357 --> 40:32.957
- It's good to meet you.
- This is Lt McClane.

40:33.257 --> 40:35.957
This is Mr Carver.

40:36.257 --> 40:38.757
We've got
a couple of questions first.

40:39.057 --> 40:41.158
Do you recognize this guy?

40:45.758 --> 40:48.758
- No.
- How about this one?

40:53.258 --> 40:55.458
How about you?

40:57.458 --> 40:59.758
Did you recognize
the voice on the phone?

40:59.958 --> 41:01.758
No.

41:01.958 --> 41:04.558
Did you, uh, notice
any cars following you?

41:08.058 --> 41:10.558
- No.
- Anybody following you at all?

41:10.758 --> 41:13.258
Any kind of surveillance?
Telephone? House?

41:13.558 --> 41:16.458
Anything unusual at all?

41:16.758 --> 41:21.158
Well, now that you mention it,
I have experienced a...

41:21.458 --> 41:23.858
you know, like a burning sensation
between my toes.

41:24.058 --> 41:27.158
I thought it was just some athlete's
foot or something. I don't know.

41:30.158 --> 41:34.058
We read your jacket, Lieutenant.
We were told you would be cooperative.

41:34.358 --> 41:36.158
- Cooperate with what?
What do you mean cooperate?
- Hey, now wait a minute. He will be.

41:36.458 --> 41:38.958
- We're wasting time
here in this goddam van.
- You wanna share information...

41:39.158 --> 41:40.958
how about sending
a little our way as well?

41:41.158 --> 41:43.358
- Look, we wanna hear
what he knows first.
- What the hell?

41:43.558 --> 41:46.158
- You give us pictures, and then you...
- Look, we want to hear
what he knows first.

41:46.358 --> 41:48.558
Hey, I know as much as you know.
All right?

41:50.058 --> 41:52.559
There's a guy out there
settin' off bombs.

41:52.759 --> 41:56.259
He calls himself Simon.
He speaks with a German accent.

41:56.459 --> 41:59.259
And, for some reason,
he's very angry with me.

41:59.559 --> 42:02.159
Now, maybe you can tell me
why, fellas.

42:07.659 --> 42:11.459
The first man there is Methias Targo.
Was Hungarian army.

42:11.659 --> 42:14.259
Explosives expert. Now we believe
he's working for the Iranians.

42:14.659 --> 42:18.459
- Working?
- Freelance terrorism, by contract.

42:20.159 --> 42:21.959
- Who's the girl?
- Targo's other half.

42:22.159 --> 42:24.559
Rumour is the Israelis slipped a bomb
in between their sheets.

42:24.759 --> 42:28.359
Uh, he wasn't at home,
but they think maybe they got her.

42:28.559 --> 42:32.659
The second man was an obscure colonel
in the East German army.

42:33.059 --> 42:37.259
He ran an infiltration unit.
The kind of thing the Nazis did
at the Battle of the Bulge.

42:37.559 --> 42:40.459
- English-speaking troops...
- Yeah, yeah, I saw the movie.

42:41.759 --> 42:46.659
All we know of him is the G.D.R. medical
records show he suffers from migraines.

42:47.059 --> 42:49.759
His name is Peter Krieg.

42:52.359 --> 42:55.659
Well, that is
an exceptional report, fellas.

42:55.959 --> 42:58.459
Now do you wanna tell me
what the hell this has to do with me?

42:58.659 --> 43:01.259
The name Gruber mean anything
to you, Lieutenant?

43:05.760 --> 43:09.360
- It rings a bell, yeah.
- LA.

43:09.660 --> 43:12.460
- What?
- That thing in the building in LA.

43:14.460 --> 43:16.960
Peter Krieg was born...

43:17.160 --> 43:20.260
Simon Peter Gruber.

43:21.560 --> 43:24.660
He's Hans Gruber's brother.

43:28.860 --> 43:32.760
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, it's that thing in LA.

43:33.060 --> 43:35.960
We figure he's got you
fitted up for a toe tag...

43:36.260 --> 43:39.060
and he's gonna do anything
to get it tied.

43:39.260 --> 43:41.960
Inspector!
Inspector, it's him!

43:43.760 --> 43:45.960
Don't let him know we're here.

43:49.360 --> 43:52.160
- Simon.
- Inspector.

43:52.460 --> 43:55.160
Now, who from the FBI
is in the van, I wonder?

43:55.460 --> 43:57.460
Let's see.
Almost certainly Cross.

43:57.660 --> 44:00.260
- Come on, Andrew. Say hello.
- Hello.

44:00.560 --> 44:03.660
And I know you never run alone,
so say hello, Bill.

44:03.960 --> 44:07.060
Still trying to butch up
by chewing on your glasses, huh?

44:09.060 --> 44:13.761
This, gentlemen, as they say,
is where the plot thickens.

44:14.161 --> 44:16.261
I have put 2,400 pounds of explosive...

44:16.361 --> 44:19.461
in one of the 1,446 schools
in greater New York.

44:19.861 --> 44:24.061
It is fitted with a timer
set to explode at exactly 3:00 pm.

44:25.661 --> 44:28.061
Thank you.
Your silence says I'm understood.

44:28.261 --> 44:30.861
Did you say 2,400 pounds?

44:31.061 --> 44:32.861
Yes, but please
don't interrupt again.

44:33.161 --> 44:35.761
Simon says, if you attempt
to evacuate schools...

44:35.961 --> 44:37.861
the bomb will be detonated
by radio.

44:38.161 --> 44:40.161
And, gentlemen,
someone will be watching.

44:40.461 --> 44:44.261
Repeat, one school will be dismissed
at 3:00 pm, permanently.

44:44.661 --> 44:46.261
- Unless...
- Unless what?

44:46.461 --> 44:50.161
Unless John McClane and his new best
friend complete the tasks I set them.

44:50.461 --> 44:52.461
John, are you listening?

44:54.161 --> 44:55.661
Yeah.

44:55.861 --> 44:58.561
The pay phone beyond Hope,
Tomkins Square Park.

44:58.861 --> 45:01.461
Twenty minutes.
Go by foot. No rush.

45:01.761 --> 45:05.661
If you're really clever,
you'll learn the location of the bomb
and the code to disarm it.

45:06.061 --> 45:07.861
Oh, and by the way, gentlemen...

45:08.161 --> 45:10.961
we got something of a bargain
on radio detonators.

45:11.261 --> 45:13.461
The only problem is
the darn things seem to respond...

45:13.761 --> 45:15.661
to police and FBI frequencies.

45:15.961 --> 45:19.061
So, if I were you,
I'd keep off your radios.

45:19.361 --> 45:21.061
Simon, wait.

45:25.462 --> 45:28.262
Twenty-four hundred pounds
of that liquid stuff.

45:28.562 --> 45:31.662
My God.
Get me the commissioner.

45:31.862 --> 45:34.562
He's doing a press conference. He's
supposed to be here in half an hour.

45:34.962 --> 45:37.962
All right, Ricky, get
every senior officer on the site
and get 'em here right away.

45:38.262 --> 45:40.362
You're not gonna give me
any jurisdictional nonsense on this?

45:40.662 --> 45:42.962
I got two kids
in the school on 64th Street.

45:44.662 --> 45:46.562
- What can I do to help you?
- How many men have you got?

45:46.662 --> 45:49.962
Seventy-five. But if I push the panic
button, I can get 500 from Washington.

45:50.262 --> 45:52.362
- When?
- 2:30, 3:00.

45:52.562 --> 45:54.762
Between now and then...

45:55.062 --> 45:58.862
We're gonna have to do this
all by ourselves. Let's go.

45:59.162 --> 46:02.362
And Tomkins Square Park
is more than two miles away,
so you guys better get running.

46:02.562 --> 46:04.562
No radios.
You take my telephone.

46:04.862 --> 46:08.162
You get anything, you call me
through the switchboard. Good luck.

46:08.362 --> 46:11.462
Thanks.
Find that bomb.

46:11.762 --> 46:13.562
- Ricky, where are they?
- Right over here.

46:13.862 --> 46:16.462
- The senior man present is Chief Allen.
- Chief of what?

46:16.662 --> 46:18.862
- Transit.
- Okay, thanks, Ricky.

46:19.062 --> 46:21.862
Gentlemen, we have a decision to make.
Chief Allen.

46:22.062 --> 46:24.562
The man who has done this
has told us that he has planted...

46:24.762 --> 46:29.362
another very large bomb in a school
here in the New York area.

46:29.662 --> 46:33.962
And he has told us that we cannot
evacuate, but he has not said
that we cannot search.

46:34.262 --> 46:37.063
Now, I recommend we get everybody,
and I mean everybody...

46:37.263 --> 46:39.463
I'm talking about police,
transit, sanitation, fire...

46:39.663 --> 46:41.463
even the goddam librarians...

46:41.763 --> 46:45.263
and we start searching schools,
and I mean right now.

46:45.563 --> 46:48.163
I'm talking about a thousand buildings
within the city limits...

46:48.363 --> 46:50.763
and we have three hours
and 15 minutes to do it in.

46:50.963 --> 46:53.663
Now, I'd like to keep the media
out of this as long as possible...

46:53.863 --> 46:56.663
because if they get in,
we've got a panic.

46:56.963 --> 46:58.663
Are we in agreement?

46:58.963 --> 47:01.863
Come on, guys. Let's go!

47:02.163 --> 47:07.263
Move it out! Move it out!
No radio contact. No radio contact.

47:17.063 --> 47:21.763
They bought it.
You can begin.

47:36.963 --> 47:39.263
Hook, line...

47:42.363 --> 47:44.363
and sinker.

47:49.564 --> 47:51.964
All right now, men.
Let's go! Let's go!

47:55.064 --> 47:56.464
Let's go!

48:08.064 --> 48:10.764
- Hey, hold on. Let me go over there.
- I gotta get through!

48:25.864 --> 48:29.064
Sergeant Turley!
Sergeant Turley!

48:29.264 --> 48:32.264
In the last five minutes, the volume
of calls in here has tripled!

48:32.464 --> 48:36.064
- What the hell is goin' on?
- Stop. Let me explain.

48:36.464 --> 48:39.564
For the rest of the day,
we're supposed to handle
the department's communications.

48:39.764 --> 48:41.664
What do you mean "handle"?

48:41.964 --> 48:45.764
They're shutting down the police band.
All calls will be coming
through this switchboard.

48:46.064 --> 48:48.164
And I'm gonna marry Donald Trump!

48:48.464 --> 48:52.664
Walsh, what's going on?
Why'd everybody tear out of here?

48:52.964 --> 48:56.664
Come on, Pamela. Look at your watch!
It's comin' up on shift change.

48:56.864 --> 48:58.664
The bean counters are worried
about overtime...

48:58.964 --> 49:01.165
so we sent everybody back
to the precinct to punch out.

49:01.365 --> 49:04.965
- The next shift
is gonna be here in a minute.
- You are so full of shit, Walsh!

49:05.265 --> 49:07.065
Thank you.

49:14.665 --> 49:16.365
What the hell?

49:28.565 --> 49:32.965
Detective, Bob Thompson,
city engineer's office.

49:34.565 --> 49:37.065
We'd like to get an idea
of the damage.

49:39.065 --> 49:42.065
Man, you guys really
got here fast.

49:43.265 --> 49:46.865
Well, it's Wall Street, sir.

49:47.265 --> 49:49.265
A lot of money here.

49:49.465 --> 49:54.065
A lot of opinion makers the mayor
doesn't wanna piss off, you know?

49:55.865 --> 49:57.665
Is this it?

50:00.265 --> 50:03.165
Holy Toledo!

50:03.465 --> 50:06.265
Somebody had fun.

50:06.565 --> 50:10.465
I'd appreciate it if you'd show
my associates the way down.

50:12.566 --> 50:15.066
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Jimmy!

50:15.266 --> 50:19.066
You got the flashlight?
Murphy, come on, you too!

50:19.466 --> 50:21.566
- Rick Walsh.
- John Gunther.

50:21.866 --> 50:23.966
Come on, gentlemen. Let's go!

50:27.566 --> 50:30.366
You were probably at the World Trades.
You know what that mess was.

51:03.466 --> 51:06.966
Please inform Mr Little
that Mr Vanderfloog is here.

51:07.266 --> 51:09.066
Mr Vanderfloog?

51:11.866 --> 51:13.966
There's a Mr Vanderfloog
for Mr Little.

51:28.367 --> 51:31.567
Go down 20 metres! Come on!

51:31.967 --> 51:34.767
- A lot of steam down here.
- Yeah, yeah. We snapped
a couple of the steam pipes.

51:34.967 --> 51:38.767
It's like a sauna. We got the subway
guys to shut down the third rail.

51:39.067 --> 51:42.367
- It's on emergency lighting.
- Yeah, emergency lights, and
there's still some light... Hey!

51:43.567 --> 51:46.267
No shooting!
Speak English!

51:46.467 --> 51:48.767
Otto doesn't speak English,
do you, Otto?

51:49.067 --> 51:51.867
- Where the hell did we get this guy?
- He's one of Targo's thugs.

51:54.867 --> 51:57.467
Pull all the way up!
Pull all the way! Pull all the way!

52:04.567 --> 52:07.067
So what's up with this LA thing?
You famous or somethin'?

52:07.267 --> 52:09.367
Yeah, for about five minutes.

52:09.667 --> 52:12.067
- Don't tell me. Rodney King, right?
- Fuck you.

52:12.367 --> 52:14.567
- You know this guy Simon
we're talking to?
- Yeah.

52:14.767 --> 52:18.467
I threw his little brother off the 32nd
floor of Nakatomi Towers out in LA.

52:19.567 --> 52:21.267
I guess he's a little
pissed off about it.

52:21.567 --> 52:23.367
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me I'm in this shit...

52:23.667 --> 52:26.567
'cause some white cop threw some
white asshole's brother off a roof?

53:12.568 --> 53:14.768
Mr Vanderfloog?
Felix Little, corporate relations.

53:15.068 --> 53:18.168
Sorry you had to wait, but apparently
there was an explosion in the subway.

53:18.368 --> 53:20.268
It's played hell
with our alarms, I'm afraid.

53:20.468 --> 53:24.168
- I trust there's nothing wrong.
- Oh, no. Good Lord, no. Safe and secure.

53:24.568 --> 53:27.468
Now, you were concerned
about a currency exchange?

53:27.668 --> 53:30.668
W-We are not a commercial bank,
in the normal sense.

53:30.968 --> 53:33.468
We're... We're primarily...

53:33.768 --> 53:36.768
governments, central banks,
that sort of thing.

53:36.968 --> 53:39.068
- Apart from the depository, of course.
- Of course.

53:39.268 --> 53:42.668
Yeah. And you are in the flower
business, Mr Vanderfloog?

53:46.769 --> 53:48.669
Back! Back! Come on!

54:13.969 --> 54:15.469
Come on!

54:28.769 --> 54:31.769
Oh, no, Mr Vanderfloog,
that's the vault elevator.

54:33.269 --> 54:36.369
I'm sorry. Our alarms
are sonic and seismic...

54:36.669 --> 54:39.069
two things which, I'm afraid,
do not react well to explosions.

54:39.469 --> 54:43.269
You know, th-this subway business
has knocked all our systems
into a cocked hat.

54:43.469 --> 54:46.169
In fact, we've had to give up
and pull the plug on the whole thing.

54:46.469 --> 54:49.069
- The repair people are downstairs now.
- Good Lord!

54:49.469 --> 54:52.769
Yes, yes. Heavens to Betsy!
If anyone knew!

54:57.169 --> 55:00.370
But I thought this was
a currency exchange.

55:00.570 --> 55:03.870
Oh, I think we'll go straight
to the withdrawal.

55:52.370 --> 55:54.770
Hey, Captain, you wanna come down here
and take a look at this?

55:55.070 --> 55:57.270
Somethin's going on.

55:57.570 --> 55:59.370
What do you think, guys?
You'll be able to fix that?

55:59.570 --> 56:01.270
Just a minute now.

56:05.170 --> 56:07.370
Okay, I'll be right back. Down!

56:12.471 --> 56:14.471
Stay back!

56:14.771 --> 56:17.371
Stay back!

56:49.871 --> 56:52.171
Come on. Come on. Shit.

57:02.571 --> 57:03.971
- Come on.
- Front desk.

57:04.171 --> 57:06.871
Yes. Call the police. Get your ass
down here right now! I'm under attack!

57:07.071 --> 57:09.971
Hey, just relax, mate.
Maybe you'll live through this.

57:10.271 --> 57:11.971
Shit!

57:34.072 --> 57:37.072
I think he's dead, my dear.

57:38.972 --> 57:41.172
All right.
Let's see to the office work.

58:01.472 --> 58:03.772
God! It's Fort Knox!

58:26.472 --> 58:29.672
$140 billion.

58:29.872 --> 58:31.872
Ten times what's in Kentucky.

58:33.073 --> 58:35.973
Fort Knox. Ha!
It's for tourists.

58:50.273 --> 58:52.273
Yeah. McClane.

58:52.473 --> 58:55.873
John, you're out of shape?
You barely made it.

58:56.273 --> 58:59.673
Yeah, well, we all barely make it.
What do you want us to do?

58:59.873 --> 59:02.573
What has four legs
and is always ready to travel?

59:02.873 --> 59:06.173
- What?
- What did he say?

59:06.573 --> 59:08.573
What has four legs
and is always ready to travel?

59:08.773 --> 59:12.273
What's the matter with you? Don't you
have kids? That's an elephant joke.

59:20.573 --> 59:22.573
That a bomb?

59:22.873 --> 59:25.573
- Yeah. Go, go ahead and grab it.
- No. You're the cop.

59:25.873 --> 59:28.373
- Man, Simon said you're supposed to be
helpin' with this.
- I'm helpin'.

59:28.673 --> 59:31.573
- Well, when're you gonna start helpin'?
- After you get the bomb.

59:49.274 --> 59:51.674
- Careful.
- I'm being careful.

59:51.974 --> 59:53.774
- Don't open it.
- What?

59:53.974 --> 59:56.674
I gotta open it.
Uh, it's gonna be all right.

01:00:09.274 --> 01:00:12.974
Shit! Shit!
I told you not to open it!

01:00:17.674 --> 01:00:19.774
I trust you see the message.

01:00:20.074 --> 01:00:23.174
It has a proximity circuit,
so, please, don't run.

01:00:23.374 --> 01:00:26.474
Yeah, I got it. We're not gonna run.
How do we turn this thing off?

01:00:26.774 --> 01:00:29.874
On the fountain there should be
two jugs. Do you see them?

01:00:30.174 --> 01:00:32.474
A five-gallon and a three-gallon.

01:00:32.774 --> 01:00:36.474
Fill one of the jugs
with exactly four gallons of water...

01:00:36.774 --> 01:00:40.074
and place it on the scale
and the timer will stop.

01:00:40.274 --> 01:00:44.674
You must be precise. One ounce more
or less will result in detonation.

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:46.874
If you're still alive in five minutes,
we'll speak then.

01:00:47.074 --> 01:00:48.874
Wait! Wait a sec...

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:54.674
- I don't get it. Do you get it?
- No.

01:00:56.975 --> 01:00:58.775
Get the jugs.

01:01:00.575 --> 01:01:03.675
Obviously, we can't fill
the three-gallon jug with
four gallons of water, right?

01:01:03.875 --> 01:01:06.375
- Obviously.
- All right. I know. Here we go.

01:01:06.675 --> 01:01:09.375
We fill the three-gallon jug
exactly to the top, right?

01:01:09.675 --> 01:01:12.675
Okay. Now, we pour that three gallons
into the five-gallon jug...

01:01:13.075 --> 01:01:15.575
giving us exactly three gallons
in the five-gallon jug, right?

01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:19.675
- Right. Then what?
- Okay. Now, take the three-gallon jug,
fill that a third of the way up...

01:01:20.075 --> 01:01:22.375
- No, no, no. He said be precise.
Exactly four gallons.
- Shit!

01:01:22.575 --> 01:01:26.175
Every cop in 50 miles is runnin'
his ass off, and I'm out here
playin' kids games in a park.

01:01:28.275 --> 01:01:30.775
You wanna focus
on the problem at hand?

01:01:47.075 --> 01:01:49.675
I thought you said you knew! You said
don't say anything if you don't know!

01:01:49.975 --> 01:01:51.675
I thought you said... Gimme the fuckin'
jug. We're startin' over.

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:53.775
- No! We can't start over!
We can't start over!
- Pour that out! We're startin' over!

01:01:53.875 --> 01:01:56.475
- We can't start over.
- Gimme the fuckin' jug, or I'm gonna put
my foot up your ass, you dumb mother...

01:01:56.775 --> 01:01:59.375
- Say it! Say it!
- What?

01:01:59.575 --> 01:02:01.375
- You were gonna call me
a nigger, weren't you?
- No, I wasn't!

01:02:01.575 --> 01:02:03.975
- Yes, you were.
What were you gonna call me?
- Asshole!

01:02:04.275 --> 01:02:05.775
How's that, asshole?

01:02:05.975 --> 01:02:07.876
You got some fuckin' problem
with me 'cause I'm white, Zeus?

01:02:08.076 --> 01:02:11.776
Is that it? Have I oppressed you?
Have I oppressed your people somehow?

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:14.776
I'll tell you what your problem is. You
don't like me 'cause you're a racist!

01:02:15.076 --> 01:02:17.176
- What?
- You're a racist.
You don't like me 'cause I'm white.

01:02:17.476 --> 01:02:20.176
I don't like you
because you're gonna get me killed!

01:02:20.376 --> 01:02:22.176
How much time?
Aw, shit!

01:02:22.376 --> 01:02:24.376
We got less than a minute.
Throw this thing away.

01:02:24.576 --> 01:02:26.376
No, we can't take it off of there.
It'll detonate. Just, wait.

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:28.876
Wait a second. Wait a second.

01:02:30.376 --> 01:02:32.476
I got it! I got it!
Exactly two gallons in here, right?

01:02:32.676 --> 01:02:35.076
- Right.
- Leaving exactly one gallon
of empty space, right?

01:02:35.276 --> 01:02:37.176
- Yeah.
- A full five gallons here, right?

01:02:37.376 --> 01:02:39.676
- Right.
- If you pour one gallon out of the five
gallons into there we have exactly...

01:02:39.976 --> 01:02:42.976
- Four gallons in there!
- Yes!
- Pour it in there! Come on!

01:02:43.376 --> 01:02:45.276
Come on!

01:02:45.576 --> 01:02:47.776
Don't spill. Don't spill it!

01:02:47.976 --> 01:02:50.676
- Good, good, good! Exactly four gallons.
- You did it, McClane.

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:53.676
- Put it on the thing!
Get it down there!
- Oh, shit.

01:03:01.776 --> 01:03:04.876
Congratulations.
You're still alive.

01:03:05.276 --> 01:03:07.176
Congratulations.

01:03:07.376 --> 01:03:10.776
- Yeah, we did it.
- You surprise me again, John.

01:03:10.976 --> 01:03:12.876
This is becoming an ugly habit.

01:03:13.176 --> 01:03:16.076
Yeah, well, I don't have the time
right now, Simon. Listen.

01:03:16.276 --> 01:03:18.577
Deal's a deal.
Where's the school bomb?

01:03:18.777 --> 01:03:21.677
On the contrary,
you have lots of time.

01:03:21.977 --> 01:03:23.977
You have...

01:03:24.177 --> 01:03:26.977
two hours and 47 minutes precisely.

01:03:27.377 --> 01:03:29.677
Plenty of time
to test those wits of yours.

01:03:29.977 --> 01:03:32.077
Hey! Hey! Hey, listen, jerk-off!

01:03:32.277 --> 01:03:34.877
Let me tell you somethin'!
I got a bad fuckin' hangover, all right?

01:03:35.177 --> 01:03:37.777
And I'm a little sick of these fuckin'
riddles! Now, where is the school bomb?

01:03:37.977 --> 01:03:42.277
Temper, John.
The road to truth has many turns.

01:03:42.577 --> 01:03:45.877
You will find an envelope
under the rim of the fountain.

01:03:46.177 --> 01:03:50.177
When you undertake the trip it suggests,
ask yourself this question:

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:54.077
What is 21 out of 42?

01:03:56.377 --> 01:03:58.777
We're behind.
We should abandon the rest and go.

01:03:58.977 --> 01:04:01.977
Relax, Targo.
There's not a cop for 20 blocks.

01:04:02.177 --> 01:04:06.477
He's sending us to the home team dugout
at Yankee Stadium. Why?

01:04:06.777 --> 01:04:09.077
Well, we're the home team. Are we
supposed to find something there?

01:04:09.377 --> 01:04:11.177
What's 21 out of 42?

01:04:11.377 --> 01:04:14.577
Twenty-one again.
Half of 42. Forty-two what?

01:04:14.877 --> 01:04:17.677
- How many players
are on the Yankees ball club?
- Twenty-five.

01:04:17.977 --> 01:04:21.377
- What else is 21? Blackjack.
- It's a club.

01:04:21.677 --> 01:04:24.077
It's a wild goose chase,
is what it is.

01:04:28.277 --> 01:04:30.378
Where's the nearest "A" train?

01:04:30.578 --> 01:04:32.378
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:04:32.478 --> 01:04:34.578
You know,
some kid might find that.

01:04:36.378 --> 01:04:38.178
You're right.

01:04:43.778 --> 01:04:46.178
Come back here!
You little sons of bitches!

01:04:46.378 --> 01:04:48.978
Hey, you! I remember you!

01:04:50.578 --> 01:04:52.378
Hey, hey, hey. Where're you going?
Come here. What are you doin'?

01:04:52.678 --> 01:04:54.778
- What are you doin'?
- Let me go! Let me go, dick-head.

01:04:55.078 --> 01:04:56.478
Watch your mouth.

01:04:56.578 --> 01:04:59.678
You wanna go down to juvenile hall
for a Butterfinger? Is that it?

01:04:59.978 --> 01:05:02.678
Look around, man.
All the cops are into somethin'.

01:05:02.878 --> 01:05:04.878
It's Christmas.
You could steal City Hall.

01:05:12.278 --> 01:05:13.978
- Come on. Let's go. Come on.
- My bike.

01:05:14.178 --> 01:05:16.378
- Yo, that's my bike!
- Yeah. It's Christmas.

01:05:16.578 --> 01:05:20.678
- Hey, hey, hey! Where're you going?
Yankee Stadium's that way!
- That's my bike, you asshole!

01:05:27.478 --> 01:05:30.378
Why don't you just run over everybody
in the whole street?

01:05:30.578 --> 01:05:32.978
McClane, what the fuck
are we doin' back down here?

01:05:33.178 --> 01:05:35.778
Let me ask you somethin'. What is it
that Wall Street doesn't have?

01:05:36.078 --> 01:05:37.878
What, is this stuff catchin'?
You're talkin' in riddles.

01:05:38.078 --> 01:05:40.478
- No, no. Stay with me. What is it
that Wall Street does not have?
- What?

01:05:40.778 --> 01:05:43.779
Schools. And what is it
they have a shitload of?

01:05:44.179 --> 01:05:46.079
What?

01:05:53.479 --> 01:05:56.679
- I'll be back in a minute.
- What am I supposed to do with this?

01:05:58.579 --> 01:06:00.279
Give it to those guys over there.

01:06:00.479 --> 01:06:01.579
He's here.

01:06:01.879 --> 01:06:03.779
Perhaps you could be
a little more specific.

01:06:03.979 --> 01:06:07.979
McClane is here.
He's walking toward the bank.

01:06:09.279 --> 01:06:11.679
And the black man
is coming toward me.

01:06:11.979 --> 01:06:14.679
Oh, now that's a pity.

01:06:14.979 --> 01:06:17.279
And after we've gone to all
that trouble at the stadium.

01:06:17.479 --> 01:06:19.579
Simon, kill him.

01:06:19.779 --> 01:06:22.279
Stop toying with him
and kill him now.

01:06:23.579 --> 01:06:25.579
Okay. So be it.

01:06:25.879 --> 01:06:30.679
May he rest in peace.
I'll inform Karl in the lobby.

01:06:30.979 --> 01:06:33.779
- You pack up your team
and get out of there.
- And this one?

01:06:35.079 --> 01:06:36.779
Officer.

01:06:39.179 --> 01:06:41.679
Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm afraid
I'm gonna need an answer on that issue.

01:06:47.179 --> 01:06:50.679
- Let him go.
- Understood. Yes, sir?

01:06:50.879 --> 01:06:53.480
John McClane says to give you this.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:57.580
Wait, wait. Jesus, don't open it.
It's a bomb.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.280
- Another?
- Yeah.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:02.280
Oh, I see. Um, oh,
we'll take care of that.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.780
We better move now. Sir,
thank you so much for your assistance.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.280
We really appreciate it.
Thank you.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:13.280
What are you doing?

01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:19.680
- I don't want to ride with it.
- Some kid could...

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.980
Put it in the back.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:31.080
Hey! Y-You, you,
leavin' this place unguarded?

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.980
I understand.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.580
- How ya doin'?
- All right.

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.280
John McClane. NYPD.

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:02.080
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. It's laundry day.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.481
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:08.081
Has it been quiet like this
all morning here?

01:08:08.281 --> 01:08:11.481
- Well...
- Except for that big explosion
a couple of hours ago.

01:08:11.781 --> 01:08:14.681
I mean, have you seen anything strange
happen in the last hour or so?

01:08:14.881 --> 01:08:18.081
No. And we've had cops in here
pretty steady since the subway thing.

01:08:18.481 --> 01:08:20.081
Yeah.

01:08:20.281 --> 01:08:22.981
We were just gonna make a round on
the vault floor, if you wanna tag along.

01:08:23.281 --> 01:08:25.680
Sure. Yeah. I think I will.

01:08:25.981 --> 01:08:28.081
Now, what do you think of this heat
this late in the year?

01:08:28.381 --> 01:08:29.981
Eh, Indian summer, huh?

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:33.381
Yeah, it feels like it's gonna rain
like dogs and cats later.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:37.781
- Here's one of your guys.
- Detective, uh, Otto, isn't it?

01:08:38.081 --> 01:08:39.881
John McClane.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.381
Hey, Mike. How ya doin'?

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.281
I keep tellin' myself I'm gonna
take the stairs just for the exercise.

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.581
And on a hot day like this.

01:08:52.881 --> 01:08:55.581
But it seems like I always end up
riding the lift.

01:09:22.782 --> 01:09:24.782
Hey, what was the lottery number
last night?

01:09:24.982 --> 01:09:28.082
Any of you guys
play the lottery? No?

01:09:28.381 --> 01:09:31.282
Ah, my wife buys me two tickets
every week.

01:09:31.482 --> 01:09:33.482
For the last ten years,
plays the same two numbers all the time.

01:09:33.682 --> 01:09:35.482
I said, "Honey, why don't you play
a different number?"

01:09:35.782 --> 01:09:38.182
She goes,
"Well, those are my lucky numbers."

01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:40.482
I got the tickets right here.

01:09:42.482 --> 01:09:46.082
Put that fuckin' gun down!
Put that fuckin' gun down now!

01:09:53.082 --> 01:09:54.882
Put it down!

01:10:00.382 --> 01:10:02.382
Hello!

01:10:02.582 --> 01:10:04.682
Anybody down here?

01:10:15.082 --> 01:10:16.982
- Put your hands up!
Put your fuckin' hands up now!
- No, no, no!

01:10:17.282 --> 01:10:19.682
John, no!
No! God, it's me! It's me!

01:10:22.182 --> 01:10:24.882
- Jesus Christ,
you almost gave me a heart attack.
- You all right?

01:10:25.082 --> 01:10:26.482
You all right?

01:10:26.582 --> 01:10:28.683
- Yeah, yeah. It's not my blood.
- What the hell's goin' on down here?

01:10:28.983 --> 01:10:30.683
Go take a look in there.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:57.583
Hey, McClane.
Where the hell is everybody?

01:10:57.783 --> 01:10:59.683
Simon fuckin' says!

01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:04.383
I should've seen it comin' a mile away.
This was never about revenge.

01:11:04.583 --> 01:11:07.583
- It's about a goddam heist.
- Wh-Wh-What was in the room?

01:11:07.883 --> 01:11:11.283
- This.
- What is this?

01:11:11.583 --> 01:11:13.883
- Oh, shit! Is this gold?
- Yeah, it's gold.

01:11:14.083 --> 01:11:16.983
Damn, this is heavy!
They cleaned out a whole room of this?

01:11:17.183 --> 01:11:21.183
- Yeah.
- You know, that would've taken
like a, a, a, a tank, or a, or a, a...

01:11:21.483 --> 01:11:23.683
A dump truck.

01:11:23.883 --> 01:11:25.883
Fourteen great big dump trucks.

01:11:26.183 --> 01:11:28.283
- We almost got hit by a dump truck.
- Shit!

01:11:28.483 --> 01:11:30.983
- Damn. Slow down! Shit!
- Put that shit down.

01:11:31.183 --> 01:11:33.183
- No fuckin' way.
- They ain't gonna let you keep it.

01:11:33.383 --> 01:11:35.483
- Yeah, yeah, we'll see.
- We're gonna need a car.

01:11:35.783 --> 01:11:37.283
A car?

01:11:42.684 --> 01:11:45.984
- You know how to hot-wire this thing?
- Of course I can. I'm an electrician.

01:11:46.184 --> 01:11:47.984
Only problem is...

01:11:51.784 --> 01:11:53.784
takes too fuckin' long.

01:12:06.084 --> 01:12:09.884
- Not on the bridge!
- Down there, McClane. The FDR.

01:12:13.284 --> 01:12:15.084
Let's go, let's go. Come on!

01:12:16.584 --> 01:12:19.084
- Oh, shit!
- What?

01:12:19.384 --> 01:12:21.784
- They shot the phone.
- Oh, too bad.

01:12:22.084 --> 01:12:24.584
- Come on. What's 21 out of 42?
- I don't have a clue.

01:12:24.884 --> 01:12:28.584
- Well, what about Yankee stadium?
- We'll get there, but that son of
a bitch is not gettin' off of Manhattan.

01:12:28.784 --> 01:12:30.584
- Move!
- Jesus Christ!

01:12:30.784 --> 01:12:32.284
Who do you think you are, lady,
Hillary Clinton?

01:12:32.484 --> 01:12:34.184
- That's it! Hillary Clinton.
- What?

01:12:34.384 --> 01:12:36.984
- The 42nd president.
- No. She'd be the 43rd president.

01:12:37.184 --> 01:12:41.184
- All right, all right.
But who's the 21 st?
- I don't know.

01:12:41.584 --> 01:12:43.384
- You don't know?
- No, I don't know! Do you know?

01:12:43.484 --> 01:12:45.384
- No!
- Well?

01:12:45.684 --> 01:12:47.684
What kind of engine does this piece
of shit have? Come on, step on it!

01:12:47.884 --> 01:12:50.985
It's a Yugo. It's built
for economy, not speed.

01:12:53.585 --> 01:12:55.885
- What are you doin'?
- I'm gonna get us another phone.

01:12:59.285 --> 01:13:01.685
Wait, wait, wait!

01:13:01.885 --> 01:13:05.085
- Hey, who was the 21 st president?
- Go fuck yourself!

01:13:07.385 --> 01:13:10.885
- That guy was pissed.
- He'll feel better
when he looks in the back seat.

01:13:11.285 --> 01:13:13.185
Oh, shit.
That was my gold bar!

01:13:13.385 --> 01:13:15.885
This is McClane.
Get me Inspector Walter Cobb.

01:13:16.085 --> 01:13:19.285
- John, where the hell are you?
- Walter, it's not a revenge.
It's a heist.

01:13:19.585 --> 01:13:22.885
- What?
- There's gold in the Federal Reserve,
and they took a shitload of it.

01:13:23.285 --> 01:13:26.685
- They're headed north in dump trucks.
- Have you been drinking, McClane?

01:13:26.885 --> 01:13:28.685
No, not since this morning.

01:13:28.885 --> 01:13:31.685
Listen. There's a line of dump trucks
northbound on the FDR at about 70th.

01:13:31.885 --> 01:13:34.385
You gotta close the bridge and get some
helicopters over there right away.

01:13:34.585 --> 01:13:36.685
I couldn't close a hot dog stand
right now.

01:13:36.985 --> 01:13:39.785
I'm spread all over hell.
What about this damn bomb?

01:13:40.085 --> 01:13:42.585
Find out who the 21 st president was.
It's got somethin' to do with this.

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:44.485
John! John, the 21 st what?

01:13:44.585 --> 01:13:48.385
Walter! Shit!
Goddam cellular fuckin' phones!

01:13:48.785 --> 01:13:50.485
- Get hold of Munson in Triborough.
- Inspector.

01:13:50.785 --> 01:13:53.585
Tell him to close all the East River
bridges north of 59th Street.

01:13:53.885 --> 01:13:55.685
- Lookin' for dump trucks.
- Dump trucks?

01:13:55.985 --> 01:13:59.685
McClane says there are dump trucks
headed up the FDR loaded with gold.

01:13:59.985 --> 01:14:03.086
Walter, they don't allow
dump trucks on the FDR!

01:14:03.386 --> 01:14:05.386
- Connie!
- All right.
You don't want I should argue.

01:14:05.686 --> 01:14:07.986
I won't argue,
no matter how stupid it is.

01:14:08.186 --> 01:14:10.986
K-9, bring it around to the back.
Check out the boiler room.

01:14:11.286 --> 01:14:12.986
Find anything, Charlie?

01:14:13.186 --> 01:14:16.286
I could spend a week in here with
an X-ray machine and still not find it.

01:14:16.586 --> 01:14:19.786
You don't have a week, Charlie.
You got five more minutes. Then
we're movin' up to 86th Street.

01:14:19.986 --> 01:14:22.186
We're goin' as fast as we can.

01:14:22.486 --> 01:14:23.886
What's up?

01:14:24.186 --> 01:14:27.486
McClane was mentioning something
about the Federal Reserve Building.

01:14:27.786 --> 01:14:31.186
- Isn't that right near that Wall Street
bomb site we just left?
- Yeah.

01:14:37.586 --> 01:14:39.686
How long do you want us
to stay here?

01:14:39.986 --> 01:14:42.386
The men at the stadium.
Stay or go?

01:14:42.586 --> 01:14:44.786
Karl should have checked in by now.

01:14:44.986 --> 01:14:46.986
Moment.

01:14:54.186 --> 01:14:56.186
Come on. Come on.

01:14:57.586 --> 01:15:00.686
Stay where you are.
McClane may still turn up.

01:15:01.986 --> 01:15:05.486
Relax, Targo.
If he is still alive...

01:15:05.886 --> 01:15:08.186
he won't be talking to anyone.

01:15:08.386 --> 01:15:09.686
It's the next turn-off.

01:15:11.186 --> 01:15:13.286
Hi. It's Elvis Duran.
You're on the air. What's up?

01:15:13.486 --> 01:15:16.387
First of all, I just wanna tell you
what a great show you got.

01:15:16.687 --> 01:15:19.387
- I listen to you all the time.
- Thank you. Thank you.
What do you wanna talk about?

01:15:19.687 --> 01:15:22.587
Well, you know all those cop cars
screamin'around everywhere?

01:15:22.987 --> 01:15:26.187
You know what they're up to?
There's a bomb in a school.

01:15:26.387 --> 01:15:28.587
- My cousin's a cop.
- Here you go, my dear.

01:15:28.787 --> 01:15:31.087
Somebody put a big bomb
in a school somewhere.

01:15:31.387 --> 01:15:33.587
- Seven. Five.
- Only they don't know which one.

01:15:33.887 --> 01:15:35.787
- 207...
- So they're searching all of them.

01:15:35.987 --> 01:15:38.887
- Shh. Shh.
- Every school in the metropolitan area.

01:15:39.187 --> 01:15:41.287
Holy shit.

01:15:41.487 --> 01:15:42.787
- Doris!
- Annie?

01:15:43.087 --> 01:15:44.087
Doris, can you get ahold
of my wife?

01:15:45.387 --> 01:15:49.487
Turley! Half the goddam city
just called 9-1-1!

01:15:52.387 --> 01:15:54.087
- They're gone.
- What?

01:15:54.287 --> 01:15:56.387
- They're gone!
- Who is this guy, Houdini?

01:15:56.487 --> 01:15:58.587
Shit! Down there! Down there!

01:16:00.587 --> 01:16:04.087
- This thing got air bags?
- Your side does. I don't know about my...

01:16:05.387 --> 01:16:07.187
McClane!

01:16:27.288 --> 01:16:29.088
In the truck,
let me see the hands.

01:16:30.588 --> 01:16:32.288
Put 'em on the door!

01:16:36.388 --> 01:16:38.688
Don't kill me! Don't shoot me!

01:16:40.388 --> 01:16:42.188
- You a truck driver?
- No, I'm a beautician.

01:16:42.388 --> 01:16:44.688
Of course I'm a truck driver!

01:16:45.988 --> 01:16:49.088
- Where are you takin' this truck?
- The aqueduct.

01:16:49.388 --> 01:16:51.088
What are you takin' a dump truck
to the race track for?

01:16:51.288 --> 01:16:55.888
- No, the aqueduct. The aque...
The water aqueduct!
- Aqueduct?

01:16:58.588 --> 01:17:02.788
See? Goes from here all the way up
to the Catskill Mountains.

01:17:03.188 --> 01:17:04.988
- What does?
- That! The water pipe!

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:07.388
Goes for about 60 miles.

01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:15.888
- Hey, you the foreman?
- Yeah.

01:17:16.088 --> 01:17:20.488
NYPD. You had any, like,
extra dump trucks come through here
in the last couple of minutes?

01:17:20.788 --> 01:17:22.588
I'm gonna write
those fuckin' clowns up.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:24.988
They better start
payin' attention to work orders,
or we're gonna kick some butt.

01:17:25.288 --> 01:17:28.388
- Who? Who are you talkin' about?
- Ah, the dozen idiots
who tore ass up the tube!

01:17:28.588 --> 01:17:31.488
We're not loadin' up there any more.
We're loadin' over here.

01:17:31.688 --> 01:17:33.688
So much for bridges and helicopters.

01:17:33.988 --> 01:17:35.788
You got a map that shows me
where this tunnel goes?

01:17:36.088 --> 01:17:37.789
Yeah. Right here.

01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:43.289
We run pretty much up
under the Saw Mill
till you get up to the Coffer Dam.

01:17:43.589 --> 01:17:46.289
From there on, we've already brought
the water down from the reservoir.

01:17:46.589 --> 01:17:50.689
- Anybody get in or outta there?
- Yeah. There's a vent shaft
every two miles.

01:17:50.989 --> 01:17:52.389
- No. I mean with a truck.
- At the Coffer Dam.

01:17:52.589 --> 01:17:54.889
You can get a truck in there.
You can get there on the surface.

01:17:55.089 --> 01:17:58.189
Just follow the Saw Mill River Parkway
up there. It's about 20 miles.

01:17:58.489 --> 01:18:00.289
All right. I'm gonna meet you
right there, all right?

01:18:00.489 --> 01:18:01.989
Wait, wait!
Wh-What am I supposed to do?

01:18:02.189 --> 01:18:05.089
- You're gonna go up to Yankee Stadium.
- McClane!

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:07.189
Go! Get outta here.
We got less than two hours.

01:18:07.389 --> 01:18:09.189
Goddam it!

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:16.589
Hey! Is somethin' wrong?

01:18:16.889 --> 01:18:19.189
480 yards of rock moved so far.

01:18:19.489 --> 01:18:21.389
Now, that's ten times
the Hoover Dam.

01:18:21.689 --> 01:18:25.489
Right now, there's 516 feet of rock
above our heads.

01:18:25.789 --> 01:18:28.389
This part is phase three
of tunnel three.

01:18:28.689 --> 01:18:31.589
Planning for it began
back in 1954...

01:18:31.789 --> 01:18:34.489
but construction didn't begin
till June of 1970.

01:18:34.689 --> 01:18:37.089
You know what the most interesting part
of tunnel three is?

01:18:37.289 --> 01:18:39.689
- What's that, Jerry?
- The valves. Each one...

01:18:46.589 --> 01:18:50.890
A big departure
from tunnels one and two.

01:18:51.190 --> 01:18:54.490
Come on! What a hell of a place
to break down.

01:18:54.690 --> 01:18:57.390
Hold it a minute, Jerry.
Let me have your hard hat.

01:18:57.790 --> 01:19:00.390
- You got a jacket?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.

01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:02.690
Wait here a minute.

01:19:02.890 --> 01:19:05.390
Wait until he gets
alongside the door.

01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:08.890
Hey, fellas.
Mickey O'Brian, aqueduct security.

01:19:09.190 --> 01:19:12.090
Hey, listen. We got a report of a guy
comin' through here with eight reindeer.

01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:24.490
Yeah, they said he was a jolly, old,
fat guy with a snowy-white beard.

01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:27.390
Cute little red and white suit.
I'm surprised you didn't see him.

01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:33.290
What is it with you guys
and these phones?

01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:37.190
This'll give me somethin'.

01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:40.490
Holy shit! Is that guy dead?

01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:44.590
- Yes, Jerry. I'm afraid he is.
- Jesus Christ.

01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:47.990
Yeah. I want you to get ahold
of a guy named Cobb.

01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:51.690
Walter Cobb. C-O-B-B.
He's the head of my police unit.

01:19:52.090 --> 01:19:55.390
Get him down here. Find him.
Tell him you were with John McClane.

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:59.490
- Tell him to find out
who the 21 st president was.
- Chester A. Arthur.

01:20:00.891 --> 01:20:03.991
- What?
- Chester A. Arthur. 1881 to 1885.

01:20:04.291 --> 01:20:06.491
Nominated vice president in 1880.

01:20:06.691 --> 01:20:09.591
Did you know he was the collector
of customs right here in New York?

01:20:09.791 --> 01:20:11.791
No, I didn't know that, Jerry.

01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:13.791
Take care of yourself.

01:20:43.591 --> 01:20:45.691
Now?

01:20:45.991 --> 01:20:49.391
No, there's only one of them.

01:21:03.391 --> 01:21:05.591
Yes or no?

01:21:07.991 --> 01:21:08.891
Yes or no?

01:21:11.792 --> 01:21:15.092
No.
We need the other one too.

01:21:17.992 --> 01:21:20.692
TV's got us. TV's got us.
We gotta release these traffic guys.

01:21:20.992 --> 01:21:22.592
No. Traffic jams
we can take care of later.

01:21:22.792 --> 01:21:25.092
- You find out what the hell
is wrong with this thing!
- Frequencies are jammed.

01:21:25.292 --> 01:21:27.192
- What about Ricky?
- I don't know.
I can't get ahold of him.

01:21:27.392 --> 01:21:29.392
- But, Walter, Federal Reserve.
- Yeah?

01:21:29.592 --> 01:21:31.892
Biggest gold storage
in the world.

01:21:34.292 --> 01:21:37.392
You get a unit back down there.
Find Ricky. Find out what the hell
is goin' on.

01:21:37.592 --> 01:21:38.892
- Walter!
- Yeah?

01:21:39.192 --> 01:21:40.892
You gotta hear this.

01:21:44.992 --> 01:21:47.092
Christ, I thought we were
going in the back way.

01:21:47.292 --> 01:21:49.992
This is the back way, Walter.

01:21:50.192 --> 01:21:53.092
In half an hour, you're gonna have
a riot at every school in this city.

01:21:59.692 --> 01:22:02.292
We'll start at the top floor.
Put 20 men on each floor.

01:22:02.592 --> 01:22:04.792
Send the other 50 men
down to the basement with us.

01:22:05.092 --> 01:22:06.992
- What about McClane?
- Not a word. I'm gettin' nothin'.

01:22:07.192 --> 01:22:09.092
- Busy signals.
- Westchester's probably worse
than we are.

01:22:09.392 --> 01:22:11.592
This is kinda puttin' all our eggs
in one basket, isn't it?

01:22:11.792 --> 01:22:13.892
- I mean, what if McClane's wrong?
- Walter?
- Yeah?

01:22:14.092 --> 01:22:16.592
This is Principal Martinez.
Principal Martinez, Inspector Cobb.

01:22:16.792 --> 01:22:19.192
- How do you do, Inspector?
- How do you do, Principal Martinez?

01:22:19.492 --> 01:22:23.693
I don't want to alarm your children.
I wonder if you could move them all
into the auditorium and keep them calm.

01:22:42.593 --> 01:22:45.593
We are coming to the dam.
You can call the rear guard.

01:22:50.993 --> 01:22:53.193
Rear guard, you can close up now.

01:22:55.093 --> 01:22:57.593
We've reached the dam.
You can come up now.

01:22:59.193 --> 01:23:02.793
Nils, you can close in now.

01:23:03.093 --> 01:23:06.393
- Nils!
- Attention, attention. Nils is dead.

01:23:06.693 --> 01:23:09.993
I repeat, Nils is dead, fuck-head.
So is his pal.

01:23:10.193 --> 01:23:12.493
And those four guys
from the East German all-stars...

01:23:12.693 --> 01:23:14.393
your boys down at the bank...

01:23:14.593 --> 01:23:16.493
they're gonna be a little late.

01:23:16.693 --> 01:23:19.293
John.

01:23:19.493 --> 01:23:24.793
In the back of the truck you're driving,
there's $13 billion worth
in gold bullion.

01:23:25.193 --> 01:23:28.293
- I wonder, would a deal
be out of the question?
- Yeah, I got a deal for ya.

01:23:28.593 --> 01:23:32.193
Crawl out from under that rock
you're hidin' under, and I'll drive
this truck up your ass.

01:23:33.593 --> 01:23:34.894
How colourful.

01:23:40.994 --> 01:23:43.094
I told you not to toy with him.

01:23:43.394 --> 01:23:45.194
Thank you. That's very helpful.

01:23:48.594 --> 01:23:51.294
You've jeopardized the mission
and the contract.

01:23:53.994 --> 01:23:55.794
We are vulnerable
till we reach the ship.

01:23:55.994 --> 01:23:57.794
I'm going to put an end to this.

01:24:00.294 --> 01:24:02.394
Stop!

01:24:04.594 --> 01:24:06.394
Targo! Targo!

01:24:06.694 --> 01:24:08.394
Here! Come here!

01:24:10.194 --> 01:24:12.194
- We blow the dam.
- What?

01:24:12.294 --> 01:24:13.694
We drown him.

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:27.094
Walter!

01:24:27.294 --> 01:24:30.094
Take a look at this. The janitor said
this one was delivered this morning.

01:24:30.394 --> 01:24:33.994
About 10:30, right?
Not hooked up.

01:24:34.194 --> 01:24:36.894
- Yeah?
- Okay. Now take a look at the front.

01:24:40.394 --> 01:24:42.494
We drill the hinges.
Get everybody out.

01:27:13.397 --> 01:27:15.397
McClane!

01:27:17.497 --> 01:27:18.897
- McClane!
- Where are you?

01:27:19.097 --> 01:27:20.597
Over here!

01:27:20.897 --> 01:27:23.197
You got a hell of a way
of flaggin' somebody down!

01:27:23.397 --> 01:27:25.597
- You all right?
- Did you go to Yankee Stadium?

01:27:25.797 --> 01:27:28.197
- Yeah! There's nobody there!
- You didn't see nobody?

01:27:28.397 --> 01:27:30.597
- No!
- Nobody was followin' you?

01:27:30.897 --> 01:27:32.897
I'm tellin' you.
He's jerkin' us around.

01:27:33.097 --> 01:27:34.897
Oh, shit! Jesus!
Come on! Come on!

01:27:34.997 --> 01:27:36.397
"Oh, no! I didn't see nobody.

01:27:36.697 --> 01:27:37.597
Nobody's following us."

01:27:37.897 --> 01:27:39.997
Go, go, go!

01:27:44.397 --> 01:27:46.597
It's not rigged. Pull it.

01:27:58.197 --> 01:28:01.897
Well, I'd say you could
call off your search.

01:28:02.197 --> 01:28:04.397
- Can you stop it?
- I shouldn't even touch it.

01:28:04.597 --> 01:28:08.797
Who knows what kind of booby traps
this thing's got. What about the code?

01:28:09.097 --> 01:28:10.597
No word.

01:28:10.797 --> 01:28:13.897
- When do we evacuate?
- Simon says he sees one kid
leave the building, boom!

01:28:14.297 --> 01:28:17.397
Fine. There's a chance
that somebody's still watchin',
but we can't stand here...

01:28:17.597 --> 01:28:19.997
with our thumb up our ass waitin'
for this freakin' thing to blow up!

01:28:20.297 --> 01:28:21.598
Okay.

01:28:27.198 --> 01:28:29.498
- Shit! Shit!
- Get your head down!

01:28:29.798 --> 01:28:31.898
Come on, Zeus, hold it steady!
Hold it steady!

01:28:37.298 --> 01:28:38.498
- Go! Go!
- Outta the way!

01:28:38.698 --> 01:28:40.198
Go around him!
Go around him!

01:28:52.998 --> 01:28:54.898
- I found out who's the 21 st president.
- Who?

01:28:55.098 --> 01:28:56.998
Some guy named Arthur.

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:59.098
- Chester A. Arthur?
- Chester A. Arthur. That's it. Yeah.

01:28:59.398 --> 01:29:01.398
- Chester A. Arthur Elementary School?
- Yeah. That's it.

01:29:01.698 --> 01:29:04.898
Gently down the stream

01:29:05.098 --> 01:29:07.598
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

01:29:07.998 --> 01:29:11.898
- Life is but a dream
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

01:29:12.198 --> 01:29:14.698
- Life is but a dream
- Row, row, row your boat

01:29:14.898 --> 01:29:17.698
- Gently down the stream
- Life is but a dream

01:29:17.998 --> 01:29:21.998
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
- Life is but a dream
- Row, row, row your boat

01:29:22.198 --> 01:29:24.698
- Gently down the stream
- Row, row, row your boat

01:29:25.098 --> 01:29:27.698
- Merrily, merrily, merrily...
- Gently down the...
- Hi, kids!

01:29:27.898 --> 01:29:31.298
I know you usually have assembly
on Fridays, but today is special.

01:29:31.498 --> 01:29:34.199
Mr Lambert here
is from the fire department...

01:29:34.499 --> 01:29:38.099
and today he wants us to practice
a brand-new fire drill.

01:29:38.499 --> 01:29:41.999
So, I want you to divide in half,
and I want half of you to go over here...

01:29:42.299 --> 01:29:45.499
- teachers will help them...
and line up against the wall.
- Open the door.

01:29:45.699 --> 01:29:50.399
The other half will go in this
direction. Please do it very quietly
and very quickly.

01:29:50.799 --> 01:29:53.799
All right? Everybody up, please.
Teachers, please help them.

01:29:54.099 --> 01:29:57.199
Fire drill, my ass.
That guy ain't from the fire department.

01:29:57.599 --> 01:29:59.399
Maybe it's 'cause of the radio.

01:29:59.699 --> 01:30:02.499
You mean, like, they're after us? Nah.

01:30:02.799 --> 01:30:05.899
- Tony squealed on us.
- No, he didn't.

01:30:06.099 --> 01:30:09.399
- Come on.
- Well, where you goin'?

01:30:12.299 --> 01:30:14.599
- Let me drive! Let me drive!
- Go, go, go!

01:30:14.799 --> 01:30:16.299
Goddam it!

01:30:18.499 --> 01:30:21.099
Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
Of course he put the bomb up
in that school.

01:30:21.499 --> 01:30:23.999
- Why would he do that?
- Make sure he got
your complete attention.

01:30:28.599 --> 01:30:30.599
- Jesus! Jesus!
- Find the fuse panel.

01:30:30.699 --> 01:30:32.199
- What?
- The fuse panel.

01:30:32.399 --> 01:30:34.199
- Where's the fuse panel to this car?
- It's right here! It's right here!

01:30:34.399 --> 01:30:36.499
- Pull out the anti-lock brakes fuse.
- Shit, I don't know which one it is.

01:30:36.799 --> 01:30:39.199
Well, then yank 'em all out then.

01:30:39.399 --> 01:30:41.599
- There.
- Put your head down.
Put your head fuckin' down.

01:30:41.799 --> 01:30:43.599
This is gonna be really bad.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:47.500
Listen to me.
Hang the fuck on, all right?

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:17.900
- Oh! Oh! What the fuck happened?
- You got a triple-A card?

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.500
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
- Excuse me.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:23.200
I got the janitors making a last sweep
of the building right now.

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:24.900
Thank you, Miss Martinez.

01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:44.900
Come on.

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.600
All right, five stud,
three nines, one...

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.600
Stay down! Stay low!

01:31:59.201 --> 01:32:01.001
Oh, man!

01:32:04.201 --> 01:32:05.901
- What the fuck are you doin'?
- Interrogatin' him.

01:32:06.101 --> 01:32:07.801
Well, what's he gonna tell you,
"I'm dead"?

01:32:08.101 --> 01:32:09.801
Well, I ain't gonna know
till I ask him, am I?

01:32:10.001 --> 01:32:13.201
Go around and see if there's
any aspirins in that glove box.

01:32:14.501 --> 01:32:16.601
No way. You do it.

01:32:22.001 --> 01:32:24.101
Ten quarters.

01:32:24.401 --> 01:32:27.101
The guy in the dump truck
had ten quarters. Exactly ten quarters.

01:32:27.401 --> 01:32:30.101
Well, maybe they were makin'
long distance phone calls.

01:32:30.301 --> 01:32:33.501
No. For the bridge.

01:32:33.801 --> 01:32:35.401
- What?
- It's for the toll on the bridge.

01:32:37.501 --> 01:32:39.501
There! There! Down on the wharf.

01:32:39.801 --> 01:32:42.701
Dump trucks.
Right there! Right there!

01:32:44.501 --> 01:32:46.601
Christ, they got it loaded
on a ship already.

01:32:48.901 --> 01:32:51.001
Shit! How about the Coast Guard?

01:32:51.201 --> 01:32:53.201
- It'd take 'em an hour to get here.
- Shit!

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:56.201
Shit! We can jump.

01:32:56.401 --> 01:32:57.701
- What?
- We can jump.

01:32:57.901 --> 01:33:00.101
Outta your fuckin' mind!
It's 100 feet down to the deck!

01:33:00.301 --> 01:33:03.501
- But not to the crane, it isn't.
- The cables would cut you in half.

01:33:04.901 --> 01:33:06.601
- I can make it.
- Bullshit. Get down.

01:33:06.802 --> 01:33:08.802
Get down. Look in the back
of that car for some gloves.

01:33:12.802 --> 01:33:15.802
Six booby traps, four dead ends...

01:33:16.102 --> 01:33:18.702
And a partridge in a pear tree

01:33:23.102 --> 01:33:25.702
Okay, honey.

01:33:25.902 --> 01:33:27.302
Let's dance.

01:33:27.502 --> 01:33:31.002
We're gonna have sort of a race.
So when I say go, I want you all
to run like crazy.

01:33:31.202 --> 01:33:33.502
All of you. You follow
the police officer and the fireman.

01:33:33.702 --> 01:33:35.502
You guys are my front runners, okay?

01:33:35.802 --> 01:33:37.902
Walter, think we're cuttin' this
a little thin?

01:33:38.102 --> 01:33:41.502
No, Joe. We're gonna wait.
McClane still may get the code.

01:33:44.102 --> 01:33:46.902
- Line me up with that crane!
- There. There. Right there. Right there.

01:33:47.102 --> 01:33:50.402
- All right.
I see it now. I see it.
- Right there. You're okay.

01:33:50.602 --> 01:33:52.902
- Shit. This is gonna take a miracle.
- Keep your fingers crossed.

01:33:53.102 --> 01:33:55.102
Swing it. Swing it.

01:33:55.402 --> 01:33:59.402
Come on. Come on. You almost got it.
Almost. Almost. Yeah! All right.

01:33:59.702 --> 01:34:01.502
Where are you goin'?
What, are you in a hurry?

01:34:01.702 --> 01:34:04.502
I'm goin' first this time,
all right?

01:34:04.702 --> 01:34:07.402
We have the intercom rigged, sir.

01:34:07.602 --> 01:34:11.602
Walter, the kids may be fine,
but you wait much longer and
I'm gonna pee in my pants.

01:34:12.002 --> 01:34:13.802
We're gonna wait, Connie.

01:34:15.002 --> 01:34:16.702
Six more minutes.

01:34:31.103 --> 01:34:32.803
- Yo, McClane.
- What?

01:34:33.003 --> 01:34:34.303
Down there.

01:34:43.903 --> 01:34:46.803
Oh, shit. Go, go, man!
Go, go, go!

01:35:12.903 --> 01:35:15.603
Oh, boy.

01:35:15.903 --> 01:35:18.203
Am I glad you talked me
outta jumpin'.

01:35:44.704 --> 01:35:46.604
Fuck.

01:35:46.804 --> 01:35:48.604
Get his feet.

01:35:58.404 --> 01:36:00.504
There's something you should see.

01:36:00.804 --> 01:36:02.704
Later.

01:36:03.904 --> 01:36:07.004
- It's important.
- Later.

01:36:07.204 --> 01:36:08.104
Now.

01:36:11.104 --> 01:36:13.604
This was in a container.

01:36:28.504 --> 01:36:32.904
We go find Simon
and drag him to the ship-to-shore radio
and beat that fuckin' code out of him.

01:36:33.304 --> 01:36:35.604
- Here. Take this.
- How's it work?

01:36:35.804 --> 01:36:39.704
- You don't know how to shoot a gun?
- Look, all brothers don't know how
to shoot guns, you racist motherfucker.

01:36:40.104 --> 01:36:44.105
Sue me. Just yank back on that
and pull the trigger. That's it.

01:36:44.305 --> 01:36:47.605
- That's it?
- That's it. Just don't shoot yourself.

01:36:48.005 --> 01:36:50.905
Hey, don't be no hero.
You find him, you come get me.

01:37:08.905 --> 01:37:10.705
Hey, Katya!

01:37:18.105 --> 01:37:20.405
Stupid. Stupid.

01:38:02.806 --> 01:38:05.606
- You have the autopilot set?
- Yes, sir.

01:38:05.906 --> 01:38:07.606
Good.

01:38:12.106 --> 01:38:14.406
Don't fuckin' move.

01:38:19.706 --> 01:38:21.806
Oh, the Samaritan.

01:38:22.006 --> 01:38:25.406
- Gimme the goddam code.
- Code?

01:38:26.706 --> 01:38:30.106
You mean for the school.
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

01:38:30.406 --> 01:38:32.506
You call in that code right now...

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:35.706
or I blow your sick ass
into the next world.

01:38:37.606 --> 01:38:39.106
If that's what you gotta do.

01:38:52.006 --> 01:38:55.706
- You gotta take the safety catch off.
- Oh, goddam!

01:38:56.006 --> 01:38:59.006
See. That works.
Now where's McClane?

01:39:16.607 --> 01:39:18.307
What was that?

01:39:22.407 --> 01:39:24.307
He said, "Don't shoot."

01:39:24.607 --> 01:39:28.407
Okay, Charlie. We're gonna
have to go with the evacuation.

01:39:28.707 --> 01:39:31.307
- We're gonna go.
- All right. You heard the man.
Let's go! Let's go!

01:39:31.607 --> 01:39:33.007
- Move! Move! Move!
- We're gonna go!
- Let's go, men!

01:39:33.307 --> 01:39:37.807
- On my mark.
Five, four, three, two, one, go!
- Let's go! Go!

01:39:38.107 --> 01:39:40.007
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:39:41.607 --> 01:39:45.007
Let's do it!
Okay, gang. Let's go!

01:39:45.407 --> 01:39:48.207
Go! Go! Go! Hip-hop! Hip-hop!
Come on. Everybody! Let's go!

01:39:48.407 --> 01:39:50.007
- Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
- Keep moving.

01:39:50.107 --> 01:39:54.207
- We're gonna win! We're gonna win!
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:39:54.507 --> 01:39:55.907
Keep moving!
To your left! To your left!

01:40:08.107 --> 01:40:12.107
What are they doin'?
Yo, where you goin'?

01:40:12.507 --> 01:40:14.407
- Hey, where you goin'?
- What's goin' on?

01:40:14.507 --> 01:40:18.508
I see you all day, little man.
Policeman.

01:40:20.208 --> 01:40:22.808
And you don't go away.

01:40:23.008 --> 01:40:25.008
Yeah, I'm that fuckin'
Energizer bunny.

01:40:27.708 --> 01:40:30.008
Where are you going now, huh?

01:40:32.508 --> 01:40:35.608
Going to arrest me, "bunny"?

01:40:35.808 --> 01:40:37.608
No.

01:40:37.808 --> 01:40:40.608
I don't think
I'm gonna arrest you.

01:40:40.808 --> 01:40:43.108
I'm gonna fuckin'...

01:40:53.508 --> 01:40:55.608
I knew it was bullshit.
There's nobody watchin'.

01:40:55.808 --> 01:40:57.608
Time to get Charlie out.

01:40:57.808 --> 01:41:00.908
- Let's move, Charles. Time's up.
- Give me another 30 seconds.

01:41:01.308 --> 01:41:03.308
Takes a minute-15
if you're a kid, Charlie.

01:41:03.408 --> 01:41:05.808
And last I looked, you weren't too light
on your feet. Now move!

01:41:07.108 --> 01:41:09.608
- Up here!
- Help us!
- Oh, my God!

01:41:09.908 --> 01:41:11.708
- Come on!
- Look over here!

01:41:11.908 --> 01:41:14.008
- Christ, get 'em outta there!
- Rooms are locked!

01:41:14.208 --> 01:41:16.708
- The rooms are locked!
- Get outta the way!

01:41:16.908 --> 01:41:21.408
Hey! Any one marked four!

01:41:21.708 --> 01:41:23.508
What's goin' on, Walter?

01:41:23.708 --> 01:41:26.008
We still have kids
in the building.

01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:33.909
- I'm stayin'.
- No, Charlie. Get outta there.

01:41:36.009 --> 01:41:38.709
You ever see that show
called The Addams Family?

01:41:38.909 --> 01:41:41.509
They got a motherfucker on there
called Lurch.

01:41:41.809 --> 01:41:43.909
You don't think I'm gonna let you
get to that gun, do you?

01:41:49.009 --> 01:41:50.309
Fuck!

01:42:09.809 --> 01:42:11.809
Help! Help! Help!

01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:14.009
Four! Fuck it!
Get outta the way!

01:42:26.309 --> 01:42:28.709
- Where are they, Walter?
- Still in.

01:42:35.309 --> 01:42:37.609
No guts, no glory.

01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:43.510
If we get to the roof,
we can jump to the next building!

01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:46.910
- Shit!
- Outta the way.

01:42:47.210 --> 01:42:50.310
Okay. Come on.

01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:52.610
Get him up here. Get him up here!
Come on! Come on!

01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:56.410
Mayday, mayday. Bridgeport Coast Guard.
Bridgeport Coast Guard, come in.

01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:11.810
Come on, kids.

01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:18.910
- Shit, it's too far!
- Over here. Down.

01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:26.810
No guts, no glory.

01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:29.810
There's a big black-and-white fuckin'
boat in the middle of the harbour.

01:43:30.110 --> 01:43:32.510
- Please stay on the line.
- Yeah, sure. I'll stay on the line.

01:43:51.011 --> 01:43:52.811
Pancake syrup?

01:43:58.311 --> 01:44:00.011
Hello, John McClane.

01:44:01.511 --> 01:44:03.511
There was never any bomb
in the school, was there?

01:44:03.711 --> 01:44:06.011
Of course not.

01:44:06.211 --> 01:44:08.711
I'm a soldier, not a monster...

01:44:08.911 --> 01:44:11.811
even though I sometimes work
for monsters.

01:44:12.111 --> 01:44:14.911
No. The real bomb is on this ship.

01:44:19.311 --> 01:44:21.711
Coast Guard.

01:44:22.011 --> 01:44:26.911
I was tellin' 'em where the boat was.
Game over, huh?

01:44:27.311 --> 01:44:30.211
Not quite over.

01:44:30.511 --> 01:44:33.511
Bridgeport Coast Guard.
Come in, please.

01:44:33.811 --> 01:44:36.411
They put you on hold?

01:44:36.711 --> 01:44:38.411
She told me to stay on the line.

01:44:42.911 --> 01:44:46.211
- Oh, God, I love this country.
- You know, your brother was an asshole.

01:44:49.111 --> 01:44:51.211
- You know, he really was an asshole.
- He was... He was an asshole.

01:44:51.411 --> 01:44:55.211
You, you got his number, yeah?
Yeah, okay.

01:44:57.411 --> 01:45:00.811
Forgive me.
Would you help Mr McClane below?

01:45:02.512 --> 01:45:04.612
Careful now.

01:45:06.012 --> 01:45:09.412
Now, do you have the communique?

01:45:09.612 --> 01:45:11.312
Bridgeport radio,
come in, please. Bridgeport.

01:45:11.612 --> 01:45:13.312
- Coast Guard.
- Are you there, dear?

01:45:13.612 --> 01:45:17.312
- Yes, we're here.
- Do you have the ability
to record a message?

01:45:17.712 --> 01:45:19.612
- Yes.
- Then please begin now.

01:45:19.812 --> 01:45:21.112
Right.

01:45:26.312 --> 01:45:28.912
This is a communique
from the CRF.

01:45:29.112 --> 01:45:32.812
For too long, the West has conspired
to steal the wealth of the world...

01:45:33.112 --> 01:45:36.712
consigning the balance of humanity
to economic starvation.

01:45:36.912 --> 01:45:39.612
Today, we will level
the playing field.

01:45:39.912 --> 01:45:43.012
In a few minutes, the contents
of the Federal Reserve Bank...

01:45:43.212 --> 01:45:45.812
the gold your economies
are built on...

01:45:46.112 --> 01:45:48.812
will be redistributed by explosive...

01:45:49.112 --> 01:45:50.912
across the bottom
of the Long Island Sound.

01:45:52.712 --> 01:45:56.112
If you are not in gridlock,
I invite you to come and watch.

01:46:01.112 --> 01:46:04.112
- You're gonna blow it all up?
- That's the idea.

01:46:04.412 --> 01:46:06.212
There are some gentlemen
in the Middle East...

01:46:06.412 --> 01:46:09.012
who seem to think that they'll make
a great deal of money.

01:46:09.312 --> 01:46:12.812
See the men safely off the ship, and
I'll see you in the port-side launch.

01:46:14.113 --> 01:46:16.513
The hell's all this
got to do with killin' McClane?

01:46:18.213 --> 01:46:20.313
Life has its little bonuses.

01:46:20.513 --> 01:46:22.813
Didn't I hear you say
you didn't even like your brother?

01:46:23.013 --> 01:46:25.113
There's a difference, you know,
between not liking one's brother...

01:46:25.313 --> 01:46:28.713
and not caring when some dumb Irish
flatfoot drops him out of a window.

01:46:29.113 --> 01:46:30.913
Hey, I didn't even know
that motherfucker!

01:46:31.213 --> 01:46:33.313
Yes, and I never invited you
aboard this ship.

01:46:33.613 --> 01:46:35.113
No riddle is gonna stop
this motherfucker?

01:46:35.213 --> 01:46:37.913
No code, no riddle,
no fancy little countdown.

01:46:38.313 --> 01:46:41.813
Hey, fuck-head.
Yeah, you. Fuck-head.

01:46:43.513 --> 01:46:46.713
There's just one thing
I gotta know.

01:46:47.013 --> 01:46:51.613
You got any aspirins? I've had
a bad fuckin' headache all day long.

01:46:54.713 --> 01:46:56.313
Must be your lucky day.

01:46:57.913 --> 01:46:59.413
Keep the bottle.

01:47:11.813 --> 01:47:13.513
Where is the gold?

01:47:16.213 --> 01:47:18.213
He's betrayed us.

01:47:18.413 --> 01:47:21.013
The containers
are filled with that.

01:47:53.814 --> 01:47:56.014
If I hadn't have saved your fuckin' ass,
I wouldn't be sittin' here with you...

01:47:56.114 --> 01:47:58.314
about to blow up with $100 billion
in fuckin' gold!

01:47:58.714 --> 01:48:01.114
Yeah, well, I got some bad news.
You're only gonna blow up with me.

01:48:01.314 --> 01:48:03.014
- What?
- There's no gold on this boat.

01:48:03.114 --> 01:48:05.814
- How do you know that?
- 'Cause I know the man.
I know the family.

01:48:06.214 --> 01:48:10.714
The only thing better than blowin' up
$100 billion worth of gold is makin'
people think you did.

01:48:11.114 --> 01:48:14.014
- Yeah? Well, where is it?
- I don't know. He must have switched it
back on the dock somewhere.

01:48:14.314 --> 01:48:16.114
Oh, yeah. That's supposed
to make me feel better?

01:48:16.314 --> 01:48:19.314
No. You're wrong about the other thing,
though. You're not gonna die.

01:48:19.514 --> 01:48:22.514
Yeah? You know
some cop trick about handcuffs
that's gonna get us outta this?

01:48:22.714 --> 01:48:25.214
Yeah. Use a key.

01:48:25.614 --> 01:48:27.814
- You know how to pick this lock?
- Is this some black shit again?

01:48:28.114 --> 01:48:30.514
Will you stop with that racial shit?
Are you a fuckin' locksmith or not?

01:48:30.714 --> 01:48:33.214
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can do it
if I had somethin' to do it with.

01:48:33.414 --> 01:48:36.414
- How about a splinter
of that cable I slid down?
- That might work.

01:48:39.515 --> 01:48:41.715
- Hold on.
- Fuck are you doin'?

01:48:45.215 --> 01:48:48.815
Oh, fuck! Shit!
How's that? That big enough?

01:48:49.115 --> 01:48:51.115
Shit. Yeah.
Yeah, that might work.

01:48:51.315 --> 01:48:54.315
All right. Then I'm gonna drop it
in your hands. Cup your hands.

01:48:54.515 --> 01:48:56.315
Don't drop this motherfucker,
all right?

01:48:56.515 --> 01:48:59.415
- Get, get it right. Come on. One...
- You ready? Ready?

01:48:59.615 --> 01:49:01.615
Two... Spit it.

01:49:01.815 --> 01:49:05.015
- Yeah! Get it?
- Come on. Come on. Move your hands.

01:49:05.415 --> 01:49:07.715
All right. Okay.

01:49:08.015 --> 01:49:10.215
Damn, McClane. You know,
I was just startin' to like you.

01:49:10.515 --> 01:49:13.915
- Yeah? Well, don't. I'm an asshole.
- What are you talkin' about now?

01:49:14.215 --> 01:49:16.915
- I lied to you, Zeus.
- About what?

01:49:17.315 --> 01:49:20.115
You remember I said
Weiss found that bomb up in Harlem?

01:49:20.315 --> 01:49:22.015
- Yeah.
- They found it down in Chinatown.

01:49:22.215 --> 01:49:25.015
Oh, now that's low...
even for a white motherfucker like you.

01:49:25.215 --> 01:49:27.615
I told you I was an asshole.

01:49:27.815 --> 01:49:29.815
What the fuck was that?

01:49:30.115 --> 01:49:32.415
I don't know.

01:49:32.615 --> 01:49:34.615
Look, it was the only way
I could get you to come with me.

01:49:34.915 --> 01:49:36.915
You got a wife, McClane?

01:49:37.215 --> 01:49:40.115
- Yeah.
- I'm surprised anybody'd stay with you
long enough to be married.

01:49:40.415 --> 01:49:43.415
Yeah. Well, she didn't stick around
too long. We're sorta separated.

01:49:43.715 --> 01:49:45.215
What the fuck is "sorta separated"?

01:49:45.315 --> 01:49:48.115
Well, she was in LA,
I was in New York.

01:49:48.416 --> 01:49:51.916
Had a fight on the phone. She hung up.
I didn't call her back.

01:49:52.216 --> 01:49:55.416
- How long ago was that?
- About a year ago now.

01:49:55.716 --> 01:49:57.416
About a yea...

01:49:59.316 --> 01:50:01.816
What the fuck
are you laughin' about?

01:50:02.116 --> 01:50:05.716
You threw away your marriage
because you were too fuckin' stupid
to pick up the phone?

01:50:06.016 --> 01:50:08.216
What, you think that's funny, huh?
You laugh at other people's misfortunes?

01:50:08.416 --> 01:50:10.116
I bet you blame that shit
on your wife too, right?

01:50:10.316 --> 01:50:12.316
Well, my wife
is a very stubborn woman, yes.

01:50:15.316 --> 01:50:17.716
You better stop fuckin' laughin'
and undo these cuffs.

01:50:18.016 --> 01:50:20.016
I'm almost there!

01:50:20.216 --> 01:50:22.616
There! How's that for concentration?
Oh, shit!

01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:24.416
- What?
- Fuck! I dropped the thing!

01:50:24.616 --> 01:50:27.116
- Dropped the fucking thing?
- Goddam it!

01:50:27.416 --> 01:50:29.616
- Shit! Where is it? Where did it go?
- Find it. Find it, all right?

01:50:29.816 --> 01:50:32.416
I don't fuckin' see it.

01:50:33.716 --> 01:50:36.216
What the fuck is that?

01:50:36.416 --> 01:50:39.116
I think I made it mad.

01:50:39.416 --> 01:50:40.816
Just go, McClane.
Get the fuck out of here.

01:50:41.116 --> 01:50:44.216
- Gotta fuckin' do somethin'!
- Goddam it, McClane! Listen to me!

01:50:45.616 --> 01:50:47.916
Just go.

01:50:48.116 --> 01:50:50.716
Have a hard enough time gettin' through
the day without havin' your death
on my conscience, man.

01:50:51.016 --> 01:50:52.916
- Shut the fuck up and think, all right?
- Okay, okay.

01:50:53.116 --> 01:50:55.916
- Tools. Tools. Check the engine room.
- There's no time!

01:50:57.316 --> 01:50:59.116
- What the hell's it doin' now?
- It's mixin'.

01:50:59.316 --> 01:51:00.717
Shit!

01:51:02.517 --> 01:51:04.317
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Get ready. Lean forward.

01:51:04.517 --> 01:51:06.917
- What?
- Lean forward, goddam it!

01:51:07.117 --> 01:51:09.017
What? The fuck you doin'?

01:51:09.217 --> 01:51:11.017
Now it's gonna go fast.
Lean forward.

01:51:11.117 --> 01:51:13.617
- Oh, no, no!
- Lean forward! Get ready!
Move your hands!

01:51:13.817 --> 01:51:16.217
Damn! Motherfuckin' shit!

01:51:16.417 --> 01:51:19.317
- Come on. Let's go!
- Oh, goddam! Goddam!

01:51:19.717 --> 01:51:22.617
- Come on! Come on!
- Oh, fuck! My leg! Ow!

01:51:24.017 --> 01:51:28.117
Get upstairs! Come on!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Get upstairs!

01:51:29.417 --> 01:51:31.617
Oh, shit! Ow! Damn it! My foot!

01:51:31.917 --> 01:51:33.517
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Down there at the back of the boat.
Come on!

01:51:33.817 --> 01:51:36.217
- No, damn it!
- Run, goddam it!

01:51:36.417 --> 01:51:38.417
- I am, you...
- Come on!

01:51:38.617 --> 01:51:40.517
- All right? Watch! Watch! Watch!
- Yeah.

01:51:40.617 --> 01:51:42.817
Let's go! Down here!
The back of the...

01:52:11.117 --> 01:52:12.418
How's he doin'?

01:52:12.718 --> 01:52:15.118
I got shot in the leg.
How do ya think I'm doin'?

01:52:15.318 --> 01:52:18.118
- He's gonna be just fine.
- How about you?

01:52:18.418 --> 01:52:21.118
I'm all right.
Did ya get Ricky out of there?

01:52:23.118 --> 01:52:24.918
Yeah, they found him.

01:52:26.518 --> 01:52:29.618
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Got a bad headache.

01:52:29.918 --> 01:52:32.518
- Think they're mad at me?
- I wouldn't worry about them.

01:52:32.718 --> 01:52:36.118
They'll get to you eventually,
but right now they're busy with
this salvage operation, I guess.

01:52:36.318 --> 01:52:39.418
No! Dre-Dredges! Dredges!

01:52:39.818 --> 01:52:41.718
They're just wastin' their time.
There's no gold out there.

01:52:42.018 --> 01:52:43.818
- What do you mean?
- He took it with him.

01:52:43.918 --> 01:52:47.118
- He beat me.
- John, he beat all of us.

01:52:47.418 --> 01:52:49.918
- He wasn't playin' against you.
- Fuck that, McClane.

01:52:50.218 --> 01:52:53.218
You're still alive, aren't ya?

01:52:53.518 --> 01:52:56.118
- Well, aren't ya?
- Yeah.

01:52:56.318 --> 01:52:58.918
So he lost. Lambert.

01:52:59.218 --> 01:53:01.618
Would you give him a quarter?

01:53:01.918 --> 01:53:03.418
Asshole.

01:53:05.818 --> 01:53:07.618
- Take it easy.
- I got him.
- That's it.

01:53:07.818 --> 01:53:09.418
- Easy.
- Yeah, this is collect from John.

01:53:09.718 --> 01:53:11.918
Thanks, guys. Appreciate this.

01:53:17.418 --> 01:53:20.318
Yeah, uh, Carmine, just tell him
you'll accept the charges.

01:53:20.618 --> 01:53:23.419
Son of a bitch had aspirin.

01:53:23.719 --> 01:53:25.619
Yeah, it's John.
Yeah, I'm hangin' in there.

01:53:25.719 --> 01:53:27.819
Is Holly there?
Yeah, I'll hold on.

01:53:44.819 --> 01:53:46.419
Zeus, hold up!

01:53:46.619 --> 01:53:51.019
John? John? John?
Goddam it, you son of a...

01:54:18.619 --> 01:54:20.519
Yesterday...

01:54:20.819 --> 01:54:24.319
Yesterday we were an army
with no country.

01:54:24.719 --> 01:54:28.219
Tomorrow, we have to decide...

01:54:29.519 --> 01:54:31.819
which country we want to buy.

01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:40.420
And remember,
this is all due...

01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:45.920
to the g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-gullibility
of the New York Police Department.

01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:51.820
To fallen comrades.

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:19.220
Leutnant, take over.

01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:21.320
All right. Listen up!
First squad...

01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:24.020
you muster up in half an hour
in the school bus!

01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:25.720
You'll be the lacrosse team!

01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:29.420
The plane's in Nova Scotia.
We can leave in twenty minutes.

01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:39.220
No rush.

01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:43.820
And, Jurgen,
you'll be the Padre!

01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:45.520
Padre?

01:56:08.921 --> 01:56:10.721
Lights! Douse those lights!

01:56:33.721 --> 01:56:37.621
Hey, dick-head!
Did I come at a bad time?

01:56:43.121 --> 01:56:46.121
I think
she's pissed at you, McClane!

01:56:56.021 --> 01:56:58.422
Go! Go!

01:57:07.122 --> 01:57:08.922
He's under us right now. Come on
back around. Come on back around.

01:57:09.122 --> 01:57:11.222
- That's right. Run, motherfuckers.
- Zeus, what've we got on your side?

01:57:11.422 --> 01:57:13.222
Look like roaches
with the lights comin' on.

01:57:15.922 --> 01:57:19.522
- Are we going to Nova Scotia?
- You go with the trucks!

01:57:19.722 --> 01:57:21.922
I have something personal
to finish.

01:57:24.922 --> 01:57:26.722
Let's go to work!

01:57:28.422 --> 01:57:30.322
Come on! Move it!

01:57:40.322 --> 01:57:43.522
That's right. Run, motherfuckers!
The exterminators are here!

01:57:55.722 --> 01:57:59.522
What the fuck? Oh, shit!
What the fuck is this smoke back here?

01:57:59.822 --> 01:58:02.522
We got a chopper behind us.
You got a gun on board?

01:58:02.722 --> 01:58:04.922
What is this?

01:58:07.522 --> 01:58:10.523
Can't see a goddam thing. Hold it
still. I can't see a goddam thing.

01:58:14.623 --> 01:58:17.223
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

01:58:17.423 --> 01:58:19.523
What do you mean, "Oh, shit"?

01:58:20.823 --> 01:58:22.523
All right. Hang on. Hang on.
We're goin' down.

01:58:22.723 --> 01:58:24.523
Between those high tension wires?
See this wire?

01:58:24.823 --> 01:58:27.123
Hey, McClane! What the fuck?

01:58:29.223 --> 01:58:32.523
Hey, we got smoke! We got fuckin' smoke
and shit flyin' on me here!

01:58:35.523 --> 01:58:37.323
- Truck! Truck!
- Hold on. Here we go!

01:58:43.923 --> 01:58:47.923
Come on. We gotta get outta here! He's
gonna start shootin' at us any second!

01:58:48.223 --> 01:58:51.023
- Get him out of here.
- Shit! The belt's stuck!
I can't get it off!

01:58:51.423 --> 01:58:53.223
Look out! Here he comes!

01:58:55.023 --> 01:58:56.923
Can't get out, McClane!

01:58:57.223 --> 01:58:59.923
- Get him outta here.
- Where're you goin'?

01:59:00.123 --> 01:59:02.223
I'm gonna try
and get his attention.

01:59:20.323 --> 01:59:23.924
Oh, shit! It just keeps
gettin' better and better.

01:59:29.624 --> 01:59:32.924
I had no idea Canada
could be this much fun.

01:59:38.324 --> 01:59:40.724
Just give me somethin' to shoot at.
Come on, hotshot.

01:59:41.924 --> 01:59:44.124
Show me that smilin' face.

02:00:05.624 --> 02:00:07.424
Say hello to your brother.

02:00:09.624 --> 02:00:11.224
Get outta here!

02:00:27.424 --> 02:00:30.524
Yippee-ki-ay, motherfucker.

02:00:33.825 --> 02:00:36.925
- Looks like you got his attention.
- Yeah. It looks like it.

02:00:39.525 --> 02:00:42.725
- Think we should call a fire truck?
- Aw, fuck 'em. Let 'em cook.

02:00:45.625 --> 02:00:48.625
- Oh, shit!
- What?

02:00:48.925 --> 02:00:50.125
What?

02:00:50.325 --> 02:00:53.325
- I left Holly hangin' on hold.
- Aw, call her back.

02:00:54.925 --> 02:00:57.225
I don't know.
She's gonna be pissed.

02:00:57.425 --> 02:00:59.925
She'll get over it.

02:01:00.225 --> 02:01:03.125
I don't know, Zeus.

02:01:03.425 --> 02:01:05.425
Like I said...

02:01:05.725 --> 02:01:07.625
she's a very stubborn woman.

02:01:07.925 --> 02:01:10.325
Well, she'd have to be
to stay married to you.
