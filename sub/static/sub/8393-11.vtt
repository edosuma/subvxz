I TRIED TO WAKE HER UP,
AND I COULDN'T DO IT,

12:39.410 --> 12:40.718
AND I CALLED EARLIER BECAUSE SHE
WAS ACTING DISORIENTED.

12:40.820 --> 12:42.060
- OKAY, DISORIENTED
IN WHAT WAY?

12:42.170 --> 12:43.262
- JUST SAYING THINGS
THAT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE,

12:43.380 --> 12:44.449
LIKE SHE WAS DREAMING
OR SOMETHING.

12:44.550 --> 12:45.517

YOUR WIFE IS IN SEPTIC SHOCK.

12:51.590 --> 12:52.625
- WHAT IS THAT?

12:52.730 --> 12:53.901
- IT MEANS
THAT HER IMMUNE SYSTEM

12:54.010 --> 12:54.977
ISN'T ABLE TO DEAL
WITH THE INFECTION.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.559
WHEN WAS HER LAST
CHEMO TREATMENT?

12:56.670 --> 12:57.898

13:02.470 --> 13:05.155
- DAD, PLEASE, CAN YOU JUST
GIVE US SOME SPACE?

13:05.260 --> 13:07.057
- I NEED A C.V.P. LINE.
YOU'LL HAVE TO SIGN FOR THAT.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.388
- SIGN FOR THAT?
WHY DO I HAVE TO SIGN FOR THAT?

13:08.510 --> 13:09.841
IS THAT DANGEROUS?

13:09.960 --> 13:11.643
- ADAM, IF SHE WANTS TO PUT HER
ON A C.V.P. LINE--

13:11.750 --> 13:13.957
- DAD, WOULD YOU JUST
BACK OFF, OKAY?

13:14.060 --> 13:15.379
SHE SAID THAT I HAD
TO SIGN FOR IT.

13:15.480 --> 13:19.234
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY
I'VE GOTI'A DO THIS, ALL RIGHT?

13:19.350 --> 13:21.306
- ADAM, I-I REALLY
WANT TO JUST HELP.

13:21.420 --> 13:22.512
- WELL, DAD,
YOU'RE NOT HELPING, OKAY?

13:22.620 --> 13:24.099
SO JUST GO HOME.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.648
HER KIDNEY STONES ARE REMOVED,
AND SHE'S DOING MUCH BETTER.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.502
- MY WIFE DOESN'T
HAVE KIDNEY STONES.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.407
KRISTINA BRAVERMAN?
SHE'S RIGHT THERE, ROOM FOUR?

13:51.520 --> 13:54.546
- RIGHT. I'M SORRY, WE'RE
A LITTLE SHORT-STAFFED TODAY.

13:54.660 --> 13:56.799
- WELL, CAN I TALK
TO DR. ZISK?

13:56.900 --> 13:58.208
HE'S THE HEAD
OF CRITICAL CARE, RIGHT?

13:58.320 --> 13:59.344
- MR. BRAVERMAN,
I PROMISE YOU,

13:59.450 --> 14:00.860
YOUR WIFE IS GETTING
EXCELLENT CARE.

14:00.970 --> 14:01.959
WE GOT HER
ON A STRONG ANTIBIOTIC,

14:02.080 --> 14:03.934
AND WE'RE MONITORING HER

WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HER,
BUT WE THINK SHE IS LIKELY

14:05.430 --> 14:06.317
TO TURN AROUND.

14:06.430 --> 14:07.761
- LIKELY.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.211
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, LIKELY?
- MR. BRAVERMAN--

14:09.330 --> 14:10.251
- IS THERE A CHANCE THAT SHE'S
NOT GONNA TURN AROUND?

14:10.360 --> 14:11.463
- YOUR WIFE'S
WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT

14:11.570 --> 14:12.844
IS STILL EXTREMELY LOW.

14:12.950 --> 14:15.123
THIS Ol-TEN HAPPENS SEVEN TO TEN
DAYS AFTER CHEMO TREATMENT.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.982
NOW, THERE ARE
MANY CASES, MANY,

14:17.090 --> 14:18.887
WHERE PATIENTS
IN SEPTIC SHOCK

14:18.990 --> 14:20.218
CAN IMPROVE RADICALLY
AND QUICKLY.

14:20.340 --> 14:22.262
HOWEVER, I HAVE
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

14:22.370 --> 14:23.780
IT CAN GO THE WRONG DIRECTION.

14:23.890 --> 14:24.959
IT CAN SOMETIMES LEAD

14:25.070 --> 14:26.059
TO OTHER ORGANS
IN HER BODY FAILING,

14:26.170 --> 14:27.023
AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT
TO AVOID.

14:27.140 --> 14:28.209
- YEAH.
- OKAY?

14:28.310 --> 14:29.538
SO WE'RE GONNA
MONITOR HER CLOSELY.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.446
WE ARE GONNA GIVE HER
THE BEST CARE THAT WE CAN,

14:31.560 --> 14:34.859
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE JUST ARE NO GUARANTEES.

14:34.970 --> 14:38.098
EXCUSE ME.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.528
- [sighs]

14:49.990 --> 14:52.367
- HEY.
- HI.

14:52.470 --> 14:55.291
[laughs]
AW. THANKS.

14:55.410 --> 14:57.025
- BEST GIl-T THAT YOU'VE EVER
GOTTEN IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.610
- I BELIEVE IT.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.028
- MORE COOKIES.

15:01.140 --> 15:04.894
- YOU KNOW ME.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.480
SO I WENT TO JOEL
AND JULIA'S TODAY.

15:07.590 --> 15:09.319
- OH.

15:09.420 --> 15:12.218
- UH-HUH.
- HOW ARE THEY DOING?

15:12.320 --> 15:16.359
- WELL, UH, THEY'RE OKAY.

15:16.460 --> 15:19.327
- OKAY. COOL.

15:19.430 --> 15:20.590
HMM.

15:20.710 --> 15:23.634
- IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

15:23.750 --> 15:24.842
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:24.950 --> 15:26.019
- I DON'T KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

15:26.130 --> 15:27.677
- IT'S OKAY.
BUDDY, DON'T APOLOGIZE.

15:27.780 --> 15:29.156
IT'S OKAY.

15:29.270 --> 15:30.407
IT'S ALL RIGHT IF--
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST--

15:30.510 --> 15:31.886
I'M CONFUSED, 'CAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE EXCITED,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.161
AND YOU SEEMED
LIKE IT WAS GOING WELL, AND--

15:34.270 --> 15:36.022
- NO, IT DIDN'T GO WELL.

15:36.140 --> 15:38.131
IT WAS--IT WAS A MESS.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.798
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.868
IT WAS NOT THE RIGHT JOB
FOR ME, BUT...

15:41.970 --> 15:43.176
- OKAY.
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.931
I HANDLED IT COMPLETELY WRONG.
- IT'S OKAY.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.622
I DO FEEL LIKE
WE SHOULD CLEAR THIS UP

15:48.740 --> 15:50.458
WITH JOEL, THOUGH.

15:50.570 --> 15:51.832
OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT?
I MEAN, DID YOU--

15:51.950 --> 15:54.418
DID YOU HAVE A PLAN
FOR DOING THAT, OR--

15:54.530 --> 15:58.159
- A PLAN?
LIKE...

15:58.260 --> 16:00.603
- [sighs]
YOU SHOULD GO NOW.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.917
THEY'RE THERE.
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD JUST GO.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.600
TAKE MY CAR, AND GO.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.096
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YEAH.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.088
JUST EXPLAIN, JUST, YOU KNOW--
HE'S VERY COOL.

16:08.200 --> 16:11.203
HE UNDERSTANDS, OKAY?
- OKAY.

16:11.310 --> 16:12.959
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

16:13.070 --> 16:14.958
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:15.070 --> 16:16.822
OKAY.
- OKAY?

16:16.940 --> 16:19.488
- MM-HMM.

16:19.590 --> 16:22.662
- I'LL SEE YOU SOON.
- ALL RIGHT.

16:22.770 --> 16:25.147
- SO I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TELL THE LITTLE KIDS THIS,

16:25.260 --> 16:28.354
BUT THAT WHOLE SANTA THING
IS A SHAM.

16:28.470 --> 16:29.698
- HOW'S THAT?

16:29.810 --> 16:32.847
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.360
THERE ARE 7 BILLION PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD,

16:34.470 --> 16:37.576
WHICH TRANSLATES TO ROUGHLY
A BILLION OR SO HOUSEHOLDS,

16:37.680 --> 16:41.309
MAYBE MORE, AND HOW COULD ONE
FAT GUY IN A RED SUIT

16:41.410 --> 16:44.095
AND A BEARD COVER THAT KIND
OF GROUND IN ONE NIGHT?

16:44.210 --> 16:45.472
AND THIS GUY
IS DEFINITELY NOT REAL.

16:45.590 --> 16:46.272
HE'S GOT A FAKE BEARD.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.792
- YEAH.
- HO, HO, HO!

16:48.900 --> 16:51.414
- LISTEN, YOU'RE MY FAVORITE
FROM THAT WHOLE TRIBE OF YOURS,

16:51.520 --> 16:52.179
SO I'M JUST GONNA GIVE YOU
SOME ADVICE.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.271
- WE'RE NOT A TRIBE.

16:54.390 --> 16:55.527
- YEAH, BUT HERE'S THE THING:

16:55.630 --> 16:59.839
IT SEEMS APPEALING
TO BE THE CYNICAL GUY.

16:59.940 --> 17:01.521
IT'S NOT.

17:01.640 --> 17:04.700
IT'S MUCH COOLER TO BE
A "GO WITH THE FLOW" KINDA GUY.

17:04.810 --> 17:07.779
- YEAH, I CAN'T DO THAT.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.326
- YEAH, ME NEITHER.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.646
- JABBAR.

17:11.750 --> 17:13.297
WE'RE GOING TO BROOKSTONE.
LET'S GO TO BROOKSTONE.

17:13.410 --> 17:15.992
- MOM, CAN WE GO TO BROOKSTONE?
- NO.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.021
- NO, NO, NO,
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.

17:17.130 --> 17:18.609
WE'VE BEEN HERE
ALL DAY, OKAY?

17:18.720 --> 17:20.711
WE GOTTA GO TO WEBB'S RANCH
TO CUT DOWN OUR CHRISTMAS TREE.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.104
- NO, BROOKSTONE HAS
THE WORLD'S BEST EVERYTHING.

17:22.210 --> 17:23.757
IT IS WAY BETTER THAN A--
- CAN WE DO IT AI-TER?

17:23.870 --> 17:25.314
- YOU CAN
GET A TREE ANYWHERE.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.341
YOU CAN ONLY GET
BROOKSTONE STUFF AT BROOKSTONE.

17:26.450 --> 17:27.553
- [sighs]
- WE ARE GOING TO BROOKSTONE.

17:27.660 --> 17:30.072

17:43.570 --> 17:46.505
OH, I'M SO GLAD

17:53.860 --> 17:55.828
- I KNOW.

17:55.930 --> 17:57.033
- AM I GONNA BE OKAY?

17:57.140 --> 17:58.414
- YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

17:58.520 --> 17:59.657
THEY'RE TAKING GREAT CARE
OF YOU,

17:59.760 --> 18:03.105
AND YOU'RE THE STRONGEST PERSON
I KNOW.

18:03.220 --> 18:06.929

I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS

18:17.160 --> 18:19.151
CAN YOU PROMISE ME THAT?

18:19.270 --> 18:22.398
- OKAY, LISTEN TO ME,
KRISTINA.

18:22.510 --> 18:24.262
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY

18:24.370 --> 18:28.989
YOU CAN SAY TO THEM
IN PERSON, IN OUR HOME,

18:29.100 --> 18:31.409
BY THE CHRISTMAS TREE.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.102
OKAY?

18:34.210 --> 18:37.691

IN THERE.

19:22.290 --> 19:23.632
THAT IS NOT A GOOD MARTINI.

19:23.740 --> 19:25.082
- THAT'S WHAT IT--
IT'S ONE OF THE INGREDIENTS.

19:25.190 --> 19:27.294
- YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE, LIKE, HALF VERMOUTH.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.460
IT'S, LIKE,
TOO MUCH VERMOUTH.

19:30.580 --> 19:32.195
I COULD MAKE A BETTER MARTINI
THAN THIS IN MY SLEEP.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.540
SO THAT'S HOW BAD IT IS.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.641

I'M JUST SAYING
I'M A GOOD BARTENDER.

19:38.550 --> 19:39.539
IT'S MY ONE SKILL.
CAN YOU LEAVE ME THAT?

19:39.660 --> 19:40.922

23:45.140 --> 23:46.869
THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE--WHAT?

23:46.970 --> 23:48.039
NO, I JUST--

23:48.150 --> 23:51.529
AH, IT'S WEIRD.
IT'S JUST A LITTLE WEIRD NOW.

23:51.630 --> 23:54.940
RIGHT? AND I GET IT,

24:04.400 --> 24:06.846
[phone rings]

24:06.960 --> 24:09.611
- UM, THIS IS MY DAD.

24:09.720 --> 24:10.641
- BUT I HAVE TO TAKE IT

24:10.750 --> 24:12.752
BECAUSE IT'S
A FAMILY THING.

24:12.860 --> 24:13.679
HI--HI, DAD.

24:13.790 --> 24:15.678

24:41.130 --> 24:42.404
I'M STARTING TO GET
REALLY STRESSED OUT,

24:45.550 --> 24:49.589
SO PLEASE TEXT ME BACK

24:49.690 --> 24:50.782
[exhales shakily]

24:54.520 --> 24:56.488
[vehicle approaches,

25:04.260 --> 25:05.739
RYAN, ARE YOU OKAY?

25:05.840 --> 25:07.728
WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU SCARED ME!

25:07.850 --> 25:08.418

25:13.060 --> 25:14.391
- OH, GOD,
WHY DIDN'T YOU PICK UP?

25:14.510 --> 25:16.853
WHERE WERE YOU?

25:16.960 --> 25:19.508
- [clears throat]
I WAS, UH---

25:19.620 --> 25:20.507
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED

25:20.620 --> 25:22.929

25:23.030 --> 25:25.089
WELL, I WAS TRYING
TO LEAVE THE PARKING LOT,

25:25.210 --> 25:26.586
AND THERE--AND ONE
OF THE YELLOW, UH,

25:26.690 --> 25:28.578
POLE THINGS THAT WAS--

25:28.690 --> 25:29.793

25:29.900 --> 25:30.889
- NO, I'M NOT DRUNK.
- YOU'RE DRUNK!

25:31.010 --> 25:32.409
- NO, I'M NOT.
I HAD A COUPLE OF BEERS.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.452
- YOU'RE LYING TO ME!

25:34.560 --> 25:35.697
YOU'RE CLEARLY DRUNK.
YOU'RE--

25:35.810 --> 25:37.072
- I'M NOT.
- YOU'RE SLURRING YOUR SPEECH.

25:37.190 --> 25:38.214
- [scoffs]
- YOU'RE---

25:38.320 --> 25:39.594
- I'M NOT DRUNK.
- I'M SORRY.

25:39.710 --> 25:41.666
CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN TO ME
THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS...

25:41.780 --> 25:43.429
- YEAH. YEAH.
- THAT YOU--

25:43.540 --> 25:44.802
YOU WENT TO JOEL'S,
AND THEN YOU DECIDED--

25:44.920 --> 25:46.182
- NO, I DIDN'T GO TO JOEL'S
BECAUSE I--

25:46.300 --> 25:48.268
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN GO?
HUH?

25:48.370 --> 25:49.359
- NO, I DIDN'T EVEN G0.
I JUST--

25:49.470 --> 25:51.950
- WHY WOULD YOU NOT GO?
- BECAUSE--

25:52.060 --> 25:53.948
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- THE REASON I DIDN'T GO

25:54.060 --> 25:55.880
IS BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK
TO HIM

25:56.000 --> 25:57.092
WHEN IWANT TO TALK TO HIM.
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

25:57.210 --> 25:58.825
- NOT BECAUSE
YOU'RE FORCING ME...

25:58.930 --> 25:59.919
- WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT?!
- TO MAKE AN ASS OF MYSELF

26:00.040 --> 26:01.519
ON HIS FRONT DOORSTEP.
- I DIDN'T KNOW!

26:01.620 --> 26:03.099
- SO YOU CAN JUDGE ME
EVEN MORE?

26:03.210 --> 26:04.962
AND I DON'T WANT TO GO.
- I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU!

26:05.080 --> 26:06.479
- YOU'RE TRYING TO CHANGE ME!

26:06.590 --> 26:08.000
- EVERYTHING I DID,
AND NOW YOU'RE MAD AT--

26:08.110 --> 26:09.179
- YOU'RE TRYING TO FIX ME
INTO SOMETHING THAT I'M NOT.

26:09.290 --> 26:10.450
- OH, PLEASE. THAT'S--

26:10.560 --> 26:11.766
- SO THAT MAYBE I CAN GO--
- THAT'S CRAZY.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.324
- OH, I AM CRAZY!
I'M SORRY!

26:13.430 --> 26:14.658
- STOP!

26:14.780 --> 26:15.735
- I'M NOT GOING
TO YOUR CHRISTMAS

26:15.850 --> 26:17.659
WITH YOUR FAMILY
SO THEY CAN JUDGE ME

26:17.780 --> 26:18.633
AND EVERYONE CAN THINK
I'M CRAZY.

26:18.740 --> 26:19.707
- THEY'RE NOT
GONNA JUDGE YOU.

26:19.810 --> 26:21.630
- I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR FREAKING CAR,

26:21.750 --> 26:23.809
AND IT'S MY FAULT!

26:23.920 --> 26:26.980

26:33.730 --> 26:36.961

26:37.070 --> 26:38.651
- OH, IT'S UP.
HERE, COME UP. LET'S GO.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.455
STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.549
- WHAT ARE
THE DOCTORS SAYING?

26:41.660 --> 26:43.594
- WELL, THEY'RE
SAYING THAT THEY--

26:43.700 --> 26:44.928
THEY HOPE
HER FEVER BREAKS,

26:45.050 --> 26:47.109
AND THAT HER WHITE BLOOD CELL
COUNT WILL COME UP

26:47.220 --> 26:49.040
SO HER BODY WILL START FIGHTING
ON ITS OWN.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.560
THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE HOPING FOR.

26:50.670 --> 26:53.298
- RIGHT.
- BUT THEY'RE HOPEFUL, RIGHT?

26:53.400 --> 26:57.746
- [sighs]

26:57.850 --> 27:00.091
- [coughs]

27:08.620 --> 27:09.518
WANT TO SIT HERE?

27:09.620 --> 27:10.587

HEY.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.106

27:14.210 --> 27:15.279

27:15.390 --> 27:19.212
I JUST--I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

27:19.320 --> 27:22.380
- YEAH.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.730
SHE'S STRONG, THOUGH.

27:24.850 --> 27:25.771
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S AN OHIO BUCKEYE.

27:25.880 --> 27:29.816
- [chuckles]
- SHE'LL MAKE IT.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.012
- I DON'T KNOW.

27:31.130 --> 27:32.848
THESE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS
WITH KRISTINA

27:32.960 --> 27:35.428
AND, YOU KNOW, HAVING NORA...

27:35.550 --> 27:38.508
[smooches]

27:38.620 --> 27:41.748
JUST MADE ME THINK
HOW LIFE IS SHORT.

27:41.860 --> 27:44.988
- YEAH, UH,
PAINFULLY SHORT.

27:52.490 --> 27:56.358
- I WANT TO HAVE
ANOTHER BABY.

27:56.460 --> 27:57.802
I--MAYBE I'M--
I DON'T KNOW.

27:57.910 --> 28:02.631
MAYBE I'M JUST
EMOTIONAL AND...

28:02.750 --> 28:03.876
ATTACHED TO THIS ONE.

28:03.990 --> 28:04.775
[laughs]

28:04.890 --> 28:06.369
- I WANT TO HAVE
ANOTHER BABY TOO.

28:06.470 --> 28:09.121
- REALLY?
- YEAH, REALLY.

28:09.230 --> 28:10.743
LIKE, PRETTY BAD.

28:10.860 --> 28:12.999
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

28:16.620 --> 28:19.589
- [coos]
- MM.

28:19.690 --> 28:20.998
- YOU'RE A TROUBLEMAKER.

28:21.110 --> 28:23.032
LOOK WHAT YOU STARTED.
- COOKIES.

28:30.770 --> 28:33.398
- RED OR GREEN?
RED.

28:33.500 --> 28:36.424
- MOM, IS IT TRUE
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS SANTA?

28:36.540 --> 28:38.747
- WHO SAID THAT?

28:38.850 --> 28:39.566
- VICTOR. HE SAID SANTA'S
JUST A FAKE GUY

28:39.680 --> 28:42.717
IN A RED SUIT.

28:42.820 --> 28:44.048
- I'M SO SORRY.
- HEY, HEY, GRANDSON.

28:44.170 --> 28:45.614
HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.540
COME HERE A SECOND.
SIT DOWN HERE.

28:47.650 --> 28:48.992
HEY, UH, GRANDDAUGHTER,
WHERE ARE YOU?

28:49.100 --> 28:50.829
YOU GUYS, I GOT, UH--
COME ON IN HERE.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.795
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING

28:52.900 --> 28:54.891
THAT'S REALLY,
REALLY IMPORTANT.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.797
OKAY, NOW, IF THERE'S
ANYBODY SITTING HERE

28:56.900 --> 28:58.936
THAT DOES NOT BELIEVE
IN SANTA,

28:59.040 --> 28:59.904
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
YOU ARE WRONG.

29:00.010 --> 29:02.558
I MET HIM.
LONG TIME AGO.

29:02.670 --> 29:05.696
I SAW HIM
WITH MY VERY OWN EYES.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.289
NOW, IF YOUR GRANDFATHER,

29:07.400 --> 29:10.779
WHO IS PRETTY OLD,
STILL BELIEVES IN SANTA CLAUS,

29:10.880 --> 29:12.848
I THINK YOU SHOULD TOO.

29:12.950 --> 29:14.292
YOU KNOW,
I WAS JUST A LITTLE KID.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.153
AND WE USED TO GO VISIT
MY GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDFATHER

29:17.270 --> 29:18.259
ON CHRISTMAS EVE,

29:18.370 --> 29:20.509
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT
OF MONEY BACK THEN,

29:20.620 --> 29:21.780
SO WE HAD TO TAKE
THE BUS.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.164
BUT ANYWAY, LATE ONE NIGHT,
CHRISTMAS EVE--

29:23.270 --> 29:25.921
IT WAS TURNING
INTO CHRISTMAS MORNING.

29:26.040 --> 29:28.235
IT WAS LIKE 12:00.
IT WAS VERY DARK.

29:28.350 --> 29:29.556
AND WE WERE GETTING
ON THE BUS,

29:29.660 --> 29:30.934
AND I WAS TAKING
THE FIRST STEP,

29:31.040 --> 29:34.271
AND OUT OF THE CORNER
OF MY EYE,

29:34.390 --> 29:36.142
I SAW SOMETHING.

29:36.250 --> 29:39.731
BIG RED SUIT
AND THIS LONG, WHITE BEARD,

29:39.840 --> 29:41.705
AND HAD A SLEIGH
WITH REINDEER AND--

29:41.810 --> 29:42.708
- DID YOU SEE RUDOLPH?

29:42.810 --> 29:43.879
- I SAW RUDOLPH

29:43.980 --> 29:46.119
AND THIS BIG BAG
FILLED WITH PRESENTS.

29:46.230 --> 29:49.848
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I SAW HIM.

29:49.960 --> 29:50.949
AND HE WINKED AT ME.

29:51.060 --> 29:56.373
- HE DID?
- YEAH, HE DID.

29:56.480 --> 29:59.711
SANTA...

29:59.830 --> 30:00.922
IS REAL.

30:01.040 --> 30:05.067
AND CHRISTMAS...

30:05.180 --> 30:07.034
IS MAGIC.

30:07.150 --> 30:11.075
CHRISTMAS BRINGS...

30:11.180 --> 30:14.069
MIRACLES.

30:14.190 --> 30:15.805
AND, I MEAN, IT'S EASY TO SAY
YOU DON'T BELIEVE

30:15.910 --> 30:18.287
AND, YOU KNOW,
BE CALLED WHAT SOME PEOPLE SAY.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.731
YOU KNOW, NAYSAYER.

30:19.850 --> 30:21.465
BUT IF YOU KEEP LOOKING,

30:21.570 --> 30:23.253
TRULY WATCHING,

30:23.370 --> 30:26.578
YOU'LL SEE.

30:26.680 --> 30:27.476
[laughter]

30:27.580 --> 30:28.604
YOU GOT THAT, GRANDSON?

30:28.720 --> 30:30.403
- YES, SIR.

30:30.510 --> 30:31.442
- GOOD.
[knock at door]

30:31.550 --> 30:34.474
- I GOT IT.

30:34.590 --> 30:35.579
- HEY.
- OH, HI.

30:35.690 --> 30:37.134
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

30:37.240 --> 30:38.889
AND I'M SORRY--I KNOW IT'S
A ROUGH TIME FOR YOUR FAMILY,

30:39.000 --> 30:40.206
AND I DON'T WANT TO INTRUDE,
AND--

30:40.320 --> 30:41.548
- OH, NO. SARAH.

30:41.660 --> 30:42.729
NOT AT ALL.

30:42.840 --> 30:43.864
- WHAT?
- THANK YOU.

30:43.980 --> 30:44.799
- WHAT ARE YI'M LOOKING AT?

30:44.910 --> 30:46.070
- HI.

30:49.570 --> 30:50.946
[clears throat loudly]

30:51.050 --> 30:52.256
- GOT A BIG GROUP
IN THERE, HUH?

30:52.360 --> 30:53.281
- WE DO.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.947
- HOW'S, UH,
HOW'S YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW?

30:55.060 --> 30:56.630
- UM, WE DON'T KNOW.

30:56.750 --> 30:57.819
WE'RE NOT SURE YET.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.741
- OH. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- THANKS.

31:00.850 --> 31:02.784
- UH...
[paper rustles]

31:02.890 --> 31:06.189
I GOT YOU THIS.

31:06.310 --> 31:08.403
- IT'S REALLY NICE
WRAPPING PAPER.

31:08.520 --> 31:09.828
- YEAH, IT'S NOTHING.

31:09.930 --> 31:10.828
IT WAS JUST LYING AROUND.

31:10.930 --> 31:12.818
BUT, UH, OPEN IT LATER.

31:12.940 --> 31:14.999
- DO YOU WANT TO COME IN?
HAVE AN EGGNOG?

31:15.110 --> 31:16.896
- THAT MIGHT BE
A LITTLE MUCH.

31:17.010 --> 31:18.170
- I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN IT.

31:18.290 --> 31:19.484
JUST TRYING TO BE POLITE.

31:19.600 --> 31:20.908
CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.
[claps]

31:21.010 --> 31:21.977
- NO, I'M NOT DRUNK,

31:22.080 --> 31:25.186
SO I'M JUST GONNA SAY
THIS FAST.

31:25.290 --> 31:26.427
ABOUT WHAT I SAID BEFORE.

31:26.530 --> 31:27.462
- MM-HMM.

31:27.570 --> 31:28.662
- THAT WE COULD MAKE THIS
A ONE-TIME THING?

31:28.780 --> 31:31.431
- MM.

31:31.540 --> 31:32.768
- WELL, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
I'M GOOD.

31:32.890 --> 31:36.883
THAT'S--THAT'S FINE,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

31:36.990 --> 31:40.858
BUT I JUST WANT TO, UM,
TO CLARIFY...

31:40.960 --> 31:43.133
YEAH, THAT'S, UM,
THAT'S NOT HOW I FEEL.

31:43.240 --> 31:46.175
I FEEL PRETTY MUCH
THE OPPOSITE.

31:48.520 --> 31:49.384
YEAH.

31:49.490 --> 31:50.821
- YEAH?
- YOU'RE NOT HORRIBLE.

31:50.940 --> 31:52.384
THAT'S WHAT I CAME
TO SAY.

31:52.490 --> 31:52.865
YOU'RE, UH,
YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.
