JIMMY DEVELLANO:
Growing up in America,

00:25.460 --> 00:28.463
right or wrong,
fair or unfair,

00:28.506 --> 00:31.248
we were kind of
trained to be...

00:31.292 --> 00:34.077
"Those Russians,
they're bad people.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.253
"They're against us."

00:36.297 --> 00:39.256
We sort of had that mentality.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.737
Even me, a little bit.

00:41.780 --> 00:44.696
But all I was
concerned about was,

00:44.740 --> 00:49.440
"How can I get good
world-class players
for the Red Wings?"

00:49.484 --> 00:53.662
And I knew that there
were good players in Russia.

00:53.705 --> 00:58.362
The problem was
you couldn't get them out
to the National Hockey League.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.804
JIM LITES: It's now
four o'clock
in the afternoon,

01:05.848 --> 01:07.893
three o'clock
in the afternoon
in Portland.

01:07.937 --> 01:10.809
We had arranged
a car service to pick us up

01:10.853 --> 01:12.246
at the airplane.

01:12.289 --> 01:15.771
And we said, "Well,
how are we gonna do this?"

01:15.814 --> 01:19.775
We checked into the hotel
where the Russian team
was staying.

01:19.818 --> 01:23.170
Sergei had a game
that night, and we got
Sergei on the phone.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.172
He said "Let's go."

01:25.215 --> 01:27.913
And Sergei said,
"No, it's my last game.

01:28.871 --> 01:31.091
"I wanna play in the game."

01:31.134 --> 01:32.614
I said, "Oh, okay, here's
what we'll do.

01:32.657 --> 01:35.486
"Take the key to your room,
slip it under our door,

01:35.530 --> 01:37.923
"And we'll go up
and get the luggage

01:37.967 --> 01:40.535
"when the game's over." I said, "I'll be in the lobby,

01:40.578 --> 01:42.754
"you come off
and you follow me.

01:42.798 --> 01:45.061
"And we go out the door,
get in the car,

01:45.105 --> 01:48.717
"get in the plane,
back to Detroit
right away."

01:48.760 --> 01:52.503
NICK POLANO: The game is over. We park the limo on the side of he hotel.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.505
It's dark back there.

01:54.549 --> 01:58.596
The driver is asking me
if we're mafia and we're
gonna kill somebody.

01:58.640 --> 02:02.557
So, I'm saying...
"No, no, we're not doing
anything bad like that.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.037
"We're waiting
for a hockey player."

02:05.081 --> 02:06.996
Literally, we were making up
as we went along.

02:07.039 --> 02:09.781
I said, "Look.
He's a player of action.

02:09.824 --> 02:11.609
Your player's gonna
leave the Russian team,

02:11.653 --> 02:14.003
he's coming to play for us.
We're with the
Detroit Red Wings management.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.613
I said, "Look, I'll give you
an extra 100 buck tip.

02:15.657 --> 02:20.140
"Just do what we say.
Just low-key it."

02:20.183 --> 02:24.144
So now, it's ten o'clock,
it's post-game, and I'm
sitting in the lobby.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.189
This bus pulls up in front.

02:27.538 --> 02:30.585
The last guy off the bus
is Sergei Fedorov.

02:30.628 --> 02:35.633
He walks into the lobby,
looks at me and goes,
"Ready to go, Jim."

02:35.677 --> 02:37.635
So, we're passing
the elevators,[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

02:37.679 --> 02:39.202
...suddenly, the doors open.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.683
And it's a guy
that Sergei knows.

02:41.726 --> 02:44.033
And Sergei says, "One minute."

02:44.076 --> 02:45.991
I'm kind of like,
"What are you doing?"

02:46.035 --> 02:48.733
I've never been
more scared in my life.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.735
SERGEI FEDOROV:
I had no idea
if he might grab me

02:50.779 --> 02:53.825
because he was
twice bigger than me.

02:53.869 --> 02:56.741
He said, "Where
are you going?"
"I'm going to Detroit."

02:56.785 --> 03:00.267
He was, "Yeah, yeah,
let's go have dinner.
We'll talk about that later."

03:00.310 --> 03:03.705
I'm like, "No, no, no.
Here's a gentleman
right there, I'm going."

03:03.748 --> 03:06.360
So he follows me down
the hall. We get in the car,
and I asked him,

03:06.403 --> 03:08.449
"Who was that
and what did you say to him?"

03:08.492 --> 03:10.973
He said, "Well, that's
my roommate,
and I said to him,

03:11.016 --> 03:13.497
"'I've not been kidnapped, I'm doing this on my own free will.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.804
"'And I will see you
down the road.'"

03:18.198 --> 03:20.461
And that's how
the Russian Five started.

03:21.853 --> 03:23.812
FEDOROV: I felt like
I made a right decision.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.382
I was ready
to play hockey there.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.930
JEFF DANIELS: The work ethic,
that is the Midwest,

03:54.973 --> 03:57.454
we have to outwork you.

03:57.498 --> 03:59.108
You went to Yale.

03:59.151 --> 04:01.893
I went to
Central Michigan University.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.634
So I gotta outwork you.

04:06.855 --> 04:10.250
You can't imagine
what it was like
in Detroit in 1982.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.121
The city was beaten.

04:12.164 --> 04:14.602
Seventeen percentage
interest rates.
Really high unemployment.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.168
You know, it was a mess.

04:16.212 --> 04:19.084
I remember covering
hockey games
in Joe Louis Arena.

04:19.128 --> 04:21.783
And what they call
Devil's Night, the night
before Halloween.

04:21.826 --> 04:24.525
And there were cars
flipped over and burning.

04:24.568 --> 04:27.049
and that's what people
remember about Detroit.

04:27.092 --> 04:29.486
DANIELS:
Back when Detroit was

04:29.530 --> 04:32.663
truly the Motor City,
in, you know, the '40's...

04:32.707 --> 04:35.449
We were jammin' cars
out of here.
That's gone.

04:35.492 --> 04:40.758
You're living in a part of the country that everybody thinks is worthless.

04:40.802 --> 04:46.286
And the Red Wings
have always been a salve

04:47.374 --> 04:48.679
for the city of Detroit.

04:52.466 --> 04:56.339
MICKEY REDMOND: You see,
hockey players'd get either
sticks or pucks in the face,

04:56.383 --> 04:59.516
and they get stitches. As soon as they're fixed up, they're back up going again.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.519
I think people
in Detroit, Michigan,

05:02.563 --> 05:05.696
uh, the automotive
capital of the world,

05:05.740 --> 05:09.396
really, really connected
with that kind
of thought process.

05:09.439 --> 05:12.094
ANNOUNCER: The Red Wings won the Stanley Cup four times

05:12.137 --> 05:16.533
within a six years span with what has been called the greatest team of all time.

05:16.577 --> 05:19.449
DAVE STRADER: There hadn't
been a championship
in Detroit since 1955,

05:19.493 --> 05:21.538
during the glory years
of Gordie Howe

05:21.582 --> 05:24.149
and the production line
with Alex Ovechkin
and Ted Lindsay.

05:25.542 --> 05:28.458
Things really started
to slide in the '70s.

05:28.502 --> 05:33.289
And slid even further
in the '80s.[CROWD CHEERS]

05:33.333 --> 05:37.032
REDMOND: When I got
traded here in '71, things
were out of whack pretty good.

05:37.989 --> 05:40.252
The Red Wings were buried

05:40.296 --> 05:43.125
so far down,
they couldn't see the top.

05:43.168 --> 05:47.172
And it was demoralizing
for a Wings fan, and you
can't blame them.

05:47.216 --> 05:49.610
There were no fans.
There was no excitement.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.829
They were always referred
to as the "Dead Wings."

05:51.873 --> 05:54.571
STRADER: And I'm sure there
was thoughts in this town,

05:54.615 --> 05:57.531
like, "What's gonna
turn this things around?"

05:57.574 --> 06:00.751
When were you
first interested in buying
the Detroit Red Wings?

06:00.795 --> 06:03.058
When my business started
taking hold fairly well,

06:03.101 --> 06:07.976
I kind of dreamt about it,
but I never, honestly,
thought it would happen.

06:08.019 --> 06:10.282
REPORTER: We've had some
rough sliding the last
10 years or so.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.459
But we've had
some glorious years.

06:12.502 --> 06:16.985
KEN HOLLAND: Mr. Ilitch
and Mrs. Ilitch, they bought
the Detroit Red Wings.

06:17.028 --> 06:21.250
Because they wanted
to see hockey, um...

06:21.293 --> 06:23.034
mean something again.

06:23.078 --> 06:27.387
I plan to surround myself
with lot of competent people.

06:27.430 --> 06:32.000
And roll up my sleeves
and work 24 hours a day
if it's necessary.

06:32.043 --> 06:33.654
ANNOUNCER: Ilitch's first job

06:33.697 --> 06:36.178
was to hire the most
capable general manager
he could find.

06:36.221 --> 06:39.094
And where better to look than the Stanley Cup champions.

06:39.137 --> 06:42.532
Jimmy Devellano
had been the architect
of the Islanders draft.

06:42.576 --> 06:47.407
The team I took over in 1982
was in the Detroit River,
quite frankly.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.800
You're looking to at least
five hard years.

06:49.844 --> 06:52.803
You've got nobody
in the bushes, and you have
the "maybe" three players

06:52.847 --> 06:54.892
who really can play
in the NHL.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.720
Well, that's...

06:56.764 --> 06:59.244
I'm giving you a blunt
assessment. I don't mean
to be rude or anything,

06:59.288 --> 07:00.637
but you don't have
any kind of a hockey club.

07:00.681 --> 07:02.813
You're a justifiable
21st after tonight.

07:02.857 --> 07:06.600
Well, I was hoping that
maybe we could by 1990,

07:06.643 --> 07:09.646
contend for the Stanley Cup.
That's what I... 1990.[INTERVIEWER LAUGHS]

07:09.690 --> 07:12.214
Well... Well, Dick,
listen, now the...[LAUGHING]

07:12.257 --> 07:16.044
DEVELLANO: I was
completing my 10th year
with the New York Islanders.

07:16.087 --> 07:19.961
We were just coming off
our third consecutive
Stanley Cup.

07:20.004 --> 07:24.531
And it was really, truly
a team that was built
through the draft.

07:24.574 --> 07:28.491
And I had promised
the Ilitches, I'd promised
the city,

07:28.535 --> 07:31.320
that we would build
this team through the draft.

07:31.363 --> 07:34.932
Is your owner... You think
he'll have the patience,
Mr. Ilitch, the Pizza King?

07:34.976 --> 07:39.023
He tells me he has,
and I have to take
the man at his word.

07:39.067 --> 07:44.464
LITES: The first draft
of the Devellano-Ilitch era,
was 1983.

07:44.507 --> 07:47.597
The first round pick
was Steve Yzerman.

07:47.641 --> 07:50.470
I certainly wasn't
sitting there thinking,
"Oh, my God," like,

07:50.513 --> 07:52.646
this organization
had struggled.

07:52.689 --> 07:56.040
You're bright-eyed
and hopeful and there's
new ownership,

07:56.084 --> 08:00.697
there's a new general manager.
You're thinking nothing
but the best.

08:00.741 --> 08:04.484
Now you pick up
Stevie Yzerman.
I'm interested.

08:04.527 --> 08:08.400
And the fans
get interested.
And that...

08:08.444 --> 08:09.663
goes for a while.

08:11.534 --> 08:15.277
But when there is some mix
of bad years with veterans
on the way out

08:15.320 --> 08:16.844
and it's not working.

08:19.934 --> 08:23.764
We still need the pieces
that put it all together.

08:23.807 --> 08:30.945
And it takes a long time
to build a great team.

08:30.988 --> 08:33.164
DEVELLANO: I thought
it would take forever.

08:34.078 --> 08:36.472
And I was getting nervous.

08:36.515 --> 08:42.477
I didn't feel you could
get enough players
out of one draft,

08:42.522 --> 08:46.438
and I knew that there
were good players in Europe.

08:46.482 --> 08:50.181
Especially in Russia.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.793
The Soviet Red Army
hockey club was
the gold standard

08:52.836 --> 08:56.492
when it came to
international hockey.
They won everything.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.409
DEVELLANO: Our scouts
watched the Russian team

09:00.452 --> 09:03.717
and when they came back,

09:03.760 --> 09:08.025
they sang the praises
of several young Russians.

09:08.069 --> 09:13.161
But they really sang
the praises of one
Sergei Fedorov.

09:13.204 --> 09:16.425
The problem was,
there was an iron curtain.

09:17.252 --> 09:19.776
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]

09:19.820 --> 09:23.650
LITES: No Russian player
would jump as their family
would be murdered.

09:23.693 --> 09:26.217
[IMITATES NECK BREAKING]
So, the feeling was

09:26.261 --> 09:28.742
if you took a Russian
or a Czech,

09:28.785 --> 09:31.745
you were really wasting
your draft choice.

09:31.788 --> 09:36.314
But I felt if we
get him in three years,

09:36.358 --> 09:38.490
five years, ten years,

09:38.534 --> 09:41.406
Even if we get him 10 years
from now, he's only 28,

09:41.450 --> 09:44.888
we got a world class player.

09:44.932 --> 09:49.066
HOLLAND: When you draft
a player, you own their
rights, basically, forever.

09:49.110 --> 09:52.940
But everybody was scared
to use draft picks
on the Russian players

09:52.983 --> 09:54.855
because you didn't know
if you'd ever see them.

09:54.898 --> 09:57.466
And draft picks are assets,
and you didn't want
to use an asset

09:57.509 --> 10:00.817
on something that you
didn't know if you'd ever see.

10:00.861 --> 10:04.560
KEITH GAVE: When Gorbachev
came along, the Soviet Union
began changing.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.301
Things started to ease up.

10:06.344 --> 10:10.914
And so, the Soviets
had started to release
older players.

10:10.958 --> 10:14.788
But it didn't guarantee
that the younger guys
were gonna come.

10:14.831 --> 10:17.138
At least not without a fight.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.618
DEVELLANO:
Being the general manager
at the time,

10:18.661 --> 10:20.576
I had to make
the final decision.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.232
You never know
what's gonna happen
in the future.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.016
LITES: There was
a certain amount of feel

10:26.060 --> 10:29.411
that if we don't
start taking these
Russian players earlier,

10:29.454 --> 10:31.282
other teams
are gonna do it.

10:31.326 --> 10:34.808
DEVELLANO: So,
I used the theory.

10:34.851 --> 10:37.332
Who are we gonna get here
now in the fourth round

10:37.375 --> 10:39.247
from North America, really?

10:40.596 --> 10:43.207
And so it was
on that basis in '89

10:43.251 --> 10:45.862
when we got
to the fourth round,

10:45.906 --> 10:49.387
we selected Sergei Fedorov.

10:49.431 --> 10:52.477
GAVE: When they made that
pick and you could hear that,
that was an audible gasp

10:52.521 --> 10:56.046
like, "Oh, my goodness, what?
The Red Wings
just took a Russian,

10:56.090 --> 10:58.440
"with their fourth pick
in the draft!"

10:58.483 --> 11:01.486
DEVELLANO: I'm sure
a few teams snickered,

11:01.530 --> 11:05.186
"There goes Devellano
wasting a draft pick."

11:05.229 --> 11:08.842
But I thought that the best
18-year-old in Russia

11:08.885 --> 11:12.062
would be able
to come over here and be
a pretty good player.

11:12.106 --> 11:14.935
When we got to the 11th round,
we did the same thing
with Vladimir Konstantinov.

11:14.978 --> 11:19.679
I believe he was
22-23 years of age.

11:19.722 --> 11:23.160
LITES: An established
player, captain
in the Russian military,

11:23.204 --> 11:24.945
a wife, a child.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.948
There's ever a communist guy
that would be hard
into the Russian system.

11:27.991 --> 11:31.125
The last guy
that's ever gonna come
is Vladimir Konstantinov.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.824
DEVELLANO:
To be fair to ownership,

11:34.868 --> 11:39.089
I'm sure at times
they wondered
if it was a good strategy.

11:39.133 --> 11:44.138
But I didn't feel it was
a big gamble if you
could get the players.

11:44.181 --> 11:47.881
And I turned around
and looked at our executive
vice-president at the table.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.405
I said, "Now we got
a superstar here.

11:50.448 --> 11:53.625
"You find a way to get him."

11:53.669 --> 11:55.758
LITES: There's no book, you know. You couldn't anywhere and say,

11:55.802 --> 11:57.325
"Okay. How do you
get a guy to defect?"

11:58.674 --> 12:01.677
I knew one guy
that spoke Russian.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.287
that was involved
in hockey in Detroit

12:03.331 --> 12:06.551
a beat writer with the
Detroit Free Press,
Keith Gave.

12:06.595 --> 12:08.989
Usually, I didn't
hear from Jim Lites

12:09.032 --> 12:11.121
unless he had something
to complain about,

12:11.165 --> 12:14.081
something that I'd written
or whatever.

12:14.124 --> 12:17.388
He said, "Okay, here's why
I asked you to lunch."

12:17.432 --> 12:20.827
"You're the only
Russian speaker I know
that knows hockey.

12:20.870 --> 12:24.700
'Would you consider
possibly helping us make
contact with these players?"

12:24.744 --> 12:27.094
I'd read enough
about reporters

12:27.137 --> 12:30.097
being used as pawns
in the middle of espionage

12:30.140 --> 12:32.926
And I'm thinking,
"Why not me?"

12:32.969 --> 12:35.450
I said, "You know,
the only thing I ask...

12:35.493 --> 12:37.408
"I want the story first.

12:37.452 --> 12:40.498
"If you can give me that,
I'll pass along your
message to these guys."

12:40.542 --> 12:43.284
Couple of weeks later,
I was on my way
to Helsinki, Finland.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.199
LITES:
We created letters.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.505
The one that Fedorov was basically had been drafted by the Detroit Red Wings,

12:47.549 --> 12:50.421
and "We will do anything
we can to help facilitate

12:50.465 --> 12:53.424
"your decision to come
to North America to play."

12:53.468 --> 12:56.123
We wrote a second letter
to Vladimir Konstantinov.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.255
"If there's ever a change
in the political climate,

12:58.299 --> 13:00.344
"we would love
to have you be a part
of the Detroit Red wings."

13:00.388 --> 13:02.390
We had to take
the position that

13:02.433 --> 13:06.133
he would report us
to the authorities for just
even making contact with him.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.051
GAVE: I get
to Helsinki with my
reporter's credentials.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.227
And the guy took me
to the dressing room area.

13:13.270 --> 13:16.534
And brought out Sergei
and Vladdy, and they're
both dripping wet.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.754
He just yanked him
right out of the showers
and brought them out there.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.800
I shook their hands...

13:20.843 --> 13:23.324
I spoke to them
in Russian a little bit.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.326
And I was getting
a little nervous

13:25.369 --> 13:28.546
'cause I noticed a guy
who kept leaning forward,
leaning forward.

13:28.590 --> 13:31.158
I'm convinced that
he was their KGB guy

13:31.201 --> 13:33.116
who made sure that none
of these guys defected.

13:34.770 --> 13:37.686
And I said, "Oh, yeah,
I got this media guide."

13:37.729 --> 13:39.557
And I can see Sergei
thumbing through the book.

13:39.601 --> 13:42.169
He sees the little thing
I had tucked in the way,

13:42.212 --> 13:44.519
and he took the book
and he kind of put it
behind his back.

13:45.955 --> 13:48.523
I had the Detroit draft list
and it showed Sergei,

13:48.566 --> 13:51.918
"There you are,
fourth round by Detroit,
74th overall."

13:51.961 --> 13:57.445
And, Sergei, he'd be
a great card player, 'cause
he showed no emotion at all.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.795
Then I showed Vladdy.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.842
I said, "Look, and the Wings
drafted you in the 11th round,
here, Vladimir Konstantinov."

14:02.885 --> 14:06.802
Vladimir Konstantinov was like the little kid who got the shiny blue bike for Christmas.

14:06.846 --> 14:10.327
He was bouncing around.
He was really excited.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.852
Couldn't wait
to get on the phone
and call Jim Lites and say,

14:12.895 --> 14:15.245
"Jim, mission accomplished."

14:15.289 --> 14:17.900
We felt lucky.
We had made
contact with them.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.381
They knew we had
drafted them within a month

14:20.424 --> 14:21.861
of the actual draft
occurring.

14:23.558 --> 14:27.431
So this was the first year
of the Super Series.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.738
where three different
Russian teams

14:29.781 --> 14:32.959
had a goodwill tour
of NHL franchises.

14:33.002 --> 14:36.353
But Red Army team
were playing in Chicago.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.922
We had a goalie coach
named Phil Myre.

14:39.966 --> 14:43.230
He said he's got a good friend who knows the Russian players.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.928
The official photographer
for the Red Army team.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.930
And I got on the phone
with Michel right away.

14:47.974 --> 14:50.237
And he had
Sergei on the phone.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.152
And we made an arrangement
at that time

14:52.195 --> 14:55.982
that Michel and I
would meet with Sergei
at the Drake hotel

14:56.025 --> 14:58.898
during his two night
stay in Chicago.

15:00.595 --> 15:03.598
It was interesting
for me. It was
like little bit exciting

15:03.641 --> 15:06.209
more than scary.

15:06.253 --> 15:10.170
I have a guy from KGB
and I choose not to tell him

15:10.213 --> 15:12.476
'cause I don't wanna get
anybody in trouble.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.827
[DOOR OPENS]
Sergei comes in.
Dressed in his best suit.

15:15.871 --> 15:19.048
When I say
a good Russian suit
for a 20-year-old kid,

15:19.092 --> 15:22.443
it looked like something
that you gotten
out of Goodwill.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.793
We ordered dinner,
talked for four hours.

15:24.836 --> 15:27.622
And I armed myself
with an NHL Standard
Players Contract.

15:27.665 --> 15:31.017
It was identical to the
contract Steve Yzerman was
playing under at the time.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.367
I had $10,000
in U.S. cash.

15:33.410 --> 15:36.718
And I had a nice brochure of the Riverfront Apartments.

15:36.761 --> 15:40.504
And I'd gone to a Chevrolet
dealer and gotten a
beautiful, glossy photograph

15:40.548 --> 15:42.115
of a brand new Corvette.

15:43.594 --> 15:46.032
And I fully intended
at that time

15:46.075 --> 15:49.774
for Sergei to leave
the Drake Hotel with me.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.865
I have no idea how my mum,
my dad would react.

15:53.909 --> 15:56.259
I have no idea
how government react.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.914
Those thoughts
were on my mind.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.612
I said, "Sergei, this money's
yours if you leave now."

16:01.656 --> 16:03.919
You never know
what's gonna happen.
This is world politics.

16:05.660 --> 16:09.794
FEDOROV: I understand
what they make,
what they drive.

16:09.838 --> 16:14.930
It would be interesting
to play in front of
20,000 people every night.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.673
LITES: He said, "No,
I do not want to desert
from the military."

16:18.716 --> 16:22.590
And I felt bad
that I didn't bring
the player back with me.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.853
FEDOROV:
Most important feeling
from the exhibition

16:24.896 --> 16:27.812
I knew I can play
against those guys.

16:27.856 --> 16:29.727
And to me they
were superheroes.

16:32.295 --> 16:38.040
DEVELLANO: In 1987,
I went to see
a Four Nations Tournament

16:38.084 --> 16:42.479
and I'm looking at the
Russian team and I see
a player without a number.

16:42.523 --> 16:48.355
I found out it was a young boy by the name of Slava Kozlov.

16:48.398 --> 16:52.750
I got on the phone
to my ownership,
Mike and Marian.

16:52.794 --> 16:57.929
I said, "I've just seen
the best 15-year-old player
I've ever seen

16:57.973 --> 17:00.715
"in my lifetime."

17:00.758 --> 17:03.196
HOLLAND: We knew
he was a fabulous talent.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.241
But, again, you didn't know
if you'd ever get him.

17:07.678 --> 17:12.074
DEVELLANO: So, in 1990,
I got bold, I got cocky,

17:12.117 --> 17:15.208
and I said, "We're taking him
in the third round."

17:15.251 --> 17:17.036
[EXHALES]

17:17.079 --> 17:20.473
Third round, you can get
some North American players.

17:20.517 --> 17:23.215
It's not the fourth round,
it's the third round.

17:27.089 --> 17:30.005
LITES: So now
we had the three Russians
to shoot for.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.443
And to be honest with you,
I had no idea how we
were gonna be able to do that.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.711
FEDOROV: I was living
at the hockey base.

17:42.626 --> 17:46.108
Those trainings,
those bags were so heavy.

17:47.544 --> 17:50.591
Just sleeping, resting,
eating, and training.

17:53.550 --> 17:57.728
There was no internet.
There was
no newspaper sometime.

17:57.772 --> 18:00.383
We were so secluded
eleven month.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.342
It kind of get us
a little bit down, you know.

18:02.385 --> 18:06.172
And when you're in the cage,
when you're on that island,
I would say,

18:06.215 --> 18:08.087
you start to think
and feel different.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.094
You just want freedom,
I guess.

18:20.229 --> 18:24.755
ANNOUNCER: Sergei Fedorov's
team came to America for some
good hockey and goodwill.

18:24.799 --> 18:28.368
Instead of Fedorov,
it was goodbye.

18:28.411 --> 18:31.458
The CBS and NBC
affiliates are reporting

18:31.501 --> 18:34.374
that Fedorov has
defected one station

18:34.417 --> 18:36.202
reporting that he
is already in Detroit.

18:36.245 --> 18:39.857
LITES: I moved Sergei
and the interpreter
right into my house

18:39.901 --> 18:41.816
and my home phone rings.

18:41.859 --> 18:44.993
[PHONE RINGS]
And it's some guy
from the State Department.

18:45.036 --> 18:48.910
"Mr. Lites, do you know
the whereabouts
of Sergei Fedorov?"

18:48.953 --> 18:52.131
So I basically said, "Yes."

18:52.174 --> 18:55.917
I'm on the couch
in the basement,
watching this crazy TV

18:55.960 --> 18:58.833
with colors
and all that stuff.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.835
LITES:
It was a night of about
six phone calls back and forth

19:00.878 --> 19:03.533
with the State Department,
Russian officials, and myself

19:03.577 --> 19:05.709
with Sergei sitting
on the couch, laughing.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.233
And I'm like holding
the phone over,

19:07.276 --> 19:09.148
"You got any intention
to going back to Russia?"

19:09.191 --> 19:11.367
And he's like, "No. Nyet."

19:11.411 --> 19:13.195
FEDOROV: I don't wanna
go back home, you know.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.066
And the issue was over.

19:15.110 --> 19:18.635
A little bit of tension here.
The calls were nasty.

19:18.679 --> 19:21.029
Quite fun, to be honest
with you. I had
a pretty good time with it.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.078
DEVELLANO: And later on,
it just so happened

19:27.122 --> 19:30.473
that the team that
Konstantinov played on,

19:30.517 --> 19:34.912
was going to play
the Red Wings,
here at Joe Louis Arena.

19:34.956 --> 19:38.786
We arranged that
at two o'clock in the morning,[ALARM BEEPING]

19:38.829 --> 19:41.876
when the Russian team
was sound asleep,

19:41.919 --> 19:47.360
that he would sneak down
the back stairs
of the Pontchartrain hotel

19:47.403 --> 19:51.886
across the road,
into Joe Louis Arena.
I had the door open.

19:51.929 --> 19:57.283
In the meantime,
I got two great,
big satchels full of money.

19:57.326 --> 20:01.417
Just wanted to emphasize
how his life could change
over here.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.724
I mean, I knew it was
a struggle over there.

20:03.767 --> 20:07.118
Here, you're gonna be...
You're gonna be rich, Vladdy.
You're gonna be rich.

20:08.337 --> 20:12.515
I said, "Vladimir,
you're an NHL player,

20:12.559 --> 20:14.387
"we'd like to have you.

20:14.430 --> 20:17.912
"And we want you to stay."

20:17.955 --> 20:20.436
And he looked at me sadly,
and he said,

20:20.480 --> 20:21.959
"I would like to come,

20:22.003 --> 20:24.875
"but I have a wife
and a daughter.

20:24.919 --> 20:27.530
"I can't desert them."

20:27.574 --> 20:29.576
Plus, he's a captain
in the Russian military.

20:29.619 --> 20:32.231
So, if he deserted,

20:32.274 --> 20:36.670
he'd be considered a felon
in Russia which would
make him, automatically,

20:36.713 --> 20:41.152
incapable of getting
an H1 visa to play
in the National Hockey League.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.808

"I want you to come over
here with your family.

to get to you down the road.

I'm gonna have
a Corvette.

21:05.438 --> 21:08.571
I was like,
"Wow, this is nice.

21:08.615 --> 21:11.618
"All that just to play?"

21:11.661 --> 21:14.969
I took my Corvette
and just drove to the malls.

21:18.973 --> 21:22.759
It was fun. Just go there
and just, I guess,
learn everything.

he paid his dues.

going to be put aside.

"Well, it's okay 'cause
the champions beat us so,
maybe we're sec..."

No. It was like,
"Fuck them.

56:26.600 --> 56:29.124
"That's ours.
We got work to do."

56:36.828 --> 56:41.310
You know, I really thought
we would get it done quicker.

56:41.354 --> 56:44.096
And you know,
when it doesn't happen,

56:44.139 --> 56:46.315
you're a little disappointed

56:46.359 --> 56:50.581
that you haven't
been able to kind of
get it all together.

It seems that you're measured
when you win a championship.

GAVE: The way Scotty
deployed the Russian Five
was beautiful.

57:00.460 --> 57:04.508
But, the more they
played together, the easier
they became to defend.

57:04.551 --> 57:07.598
LEWIS: And Scotty put the
five together, and you knew
what you were gonna get.

57:07.641 --> 57:09.687
And if you didn't like that
or didn't wanna do that,

57:09.730 --> 57:11.210
he would break them up.

57:11.253 --> 57:12.994
OSGOOD:
When he split them up,

57:13.038 --> 57:15.823
it opened up all
of our eyes to a
different way of playing.

57:19.087 --> 57:21.263
If we do have the puck,
you're always on attack.

57:21.307 --> 57:22.743
So you don't have to defend.

57:22.787 --> 57:25.833
I think it became contagious
as the year went on.

One of the things I noticed
when I came from Hartford

57:28.096 --> 57:30.142
to Detroit that year was

57:30.185 --> 57:31.752
just how good
the practices were.

We just started to realize
that if you scrimmaged
against these guys,

57:38.237 --> 57:40.457
it was very, very frustrating.

57:40.500 --> 57:44.504

But that made us
better as group,

you're getting better.

57:54.558 --> 57:58.039
OSGOOD: Igor told everybody
that you're better than
what you think you are.

57:58.083 --> 58:00.433
It evolved our game.

58:00.477 --> 58:02.348
You see that
and you see their effort

58:02.391 --> 58:04.176
just uh, it rubs off on you.

58:04.219 --> 58:07.309
There was
a culture shift going on.

58:07.353 --> 58:10.008
DRAPER: Sometimes, it was two hours before our playing in a game.

58:10.051 --> 58:13.446
You got the Russian Five,
and they're kind of kicking
the soccer ball around

58:13.490 --> 58:15.448
and the next things you know,

58:15.492 --> 58:17.189
you know, we've probably
had three-quarters
of our team before games,

58:17.232 --> 58:18.756

I'm not sure who came up

We don't know
we're gonna win or lose.

01:26:52.163 --> 01:26:54.339
I came in almost every day.
I tried to help,

01:26:54.383 --> 01:26:56.341
because the doctor said
they wanna give some hope

01:26:56.385 --> 01:26:58.561
like, there's people around,
so they can hear you.

01:26:58.604 --> 01:27:02.173
A lot of times we would play,
you know, We Are The Champions

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:05.437
'cause that was...
Vladdy really liked
that song after we won.

01:27:06.786 --> 01:27:11.487
He'd sing it in broken English and make us all laugh.

01:27:11.530 --> 01:27:15.317
REPORTER: Fans have
maintained an around-the-clock
vigil near the crash site.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.755
Sergei Fedorov
stopped by here last night
about 2:40 in the morning.

01:27:18.798 --> 01:27:21.105
He appreciated us
being out here and...

01:27:21.148 --> 01:27:22.715
It was a real good feeling.

01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:30.114
DANIELS: There was such
a love for that team.

01:27:30.157 --> 01:27:32.464
For the Russian Five.

01:27:33.335 --> 01:27:34.988
For Konstantinov.

That it was as if
a member of your
own family had been

01:27:38.949 --> 01:27:40.516
severely injured.

01:27:43.083 --> 01:27:45.869

believe it. You just...

can't believe it.

OSGOOD: Throughout the
course of the summer there
was an obvious cloud

01:28:00.057 --> 01:28:02.320
over the Stanley Cup
and the celebrations.

01:28:02.364 --> 01:28:07.282
And even a sense of guilt
in wanting to celebrate.

01:28:07.325 --> 01:28:11.198
KOCUR: I remember going
to training camp that fall,
and it felt like...

01:28:11.938 --> 01:28:14.680
A hangover.

01:28:14.724 --> 01:28:17.553
McCARTY: [CHUCKLES]
I think we might have
skated for an hour a day.

01:28:19.642 --> 01:28:21.905
Eh... just bitter.

to happy for yourself,
you still can walk at least.

01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:32.089
Same moment,
realize it's gonna be...

01:28:33.786 --> 01:28:35.571
Not the same now on.

01:28:37.529 --> 01:28:40.053
Kind of feel like
I could play for both of us.

01:28:40.837 --> 01:28:42.447
Maybe another year.

01:28:42.491 --> 01:28:45.145
That's kind of mission
I was put in my mind.

like you got your life.

01:28:53.632 --> 01:28:58.942
And then your couple of team members are fighting for their lives.

01:28:58.985 --> 01:29:00.378
It's not easy.

ANNOUNCER:
Two important members
of our team

01:29:02.728 --> 01:29:04.121
cannot be with us tonight.

01:29:04.164 --> 01:29:06.602
But here on behalf
of their husbands

01:29:06.645 --> 01:29:12.477
are Irina Konstantinov and
Ilina Mnatsakanov.

01:29:12.521 --> 01:29:17.047
to show that Vladimir
and Sergei remain

01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:20.311
in our thoughts
and prayers each day.

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:22.922
DEVELLANO:
Vladdy got out of the coma

01:29:22.966 --> 01:29:25.795
and we knew he wasn't
gonna play again.

01:29:25.838 --> 01:29:30.930
To have your life
stripped away like that
was an awful thing.

01:29:39.286 --> 01:29:44.117
IRINA KONSTANTINOV:
I'd like to thank
the community of Detroit

01:29:44.161 --> 01:29:47.251
for great support and love.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:52.256
It's a family decision
we've made

01:29:52.299 --> 01:29:57.348
that we'd like to transfer
Vladimir at this point

01:29:57.392 --> 01:30:00.395
to a different
rehabilitation center

01:30:00.438 --> 01:30:02.962
which is not
within the Michigan.

01:30:03.006 --> 01:30:07.445
And we do believe that
the better weather condition

01:30:07.489 --> 01:30:13.843
will help to
stimulate his recovery.

01:30:13.886 --> 01:30:17.107
LIDSTROM: Every day you're
at the rink, you get
reminded of what happened

01:30:17.150 --> 01:30:19.239
'cause Vladdy's locker's
right next to mine.

01:30:19.283 --> 01:30:22.242
And the guy that
should've been with you,
you know, can't be with you.

01:30:24.767 --> 01:30:29.598
I think the only release
the players had was when
they stepped on the ice.

01:30:29.641 --> 01:30:32.775
That was their away time
from looking
at Vladdy's empty locker.

01:30:32.818 --> 01:30:34.429
COMMENTATOR:
Larionov looks to Murphy

01:30:34.472 --> 01:30:36.256
Now to Lindstrom.
Will he shoot?
No, Lapointe.

01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.737
Lindstrom,
now shoots.
Goal!

01:30:41.348 --> 01:30:45.004
There was like an anger
about us. Anger mixed
with determination.

We don't really
need to say anything.

We had that...
intuition with each other.

the '98 season,

01:31:15.774 --> 01:31:19.648
and eventually we
got to the Stanley Cup.

STRADER: The Red Wings
marched through the first
three games of the series.

01:31:22.781 --> 01:31:26.132
You just felt that
they were gonna roll over
this Washington team.

For the Detroit Red Wings,

01:31:27.699 --> 01:31:30.920
the opportunity to take
the Stanley Cup home again.

01:31:30.963 --> 01:31:33.226

You don't know the future.

What happens
with these type of things,
you never know.

"We worked all year
for this moment.

"Make sure you seize it."

01:31:57.642 --> 01:32:00.123
YZERMAN:
When we got to Game 4,
there was probably

01:32:00.166 --> 01:32:03.430
10,000, maybe more
Red Wing jerseys
in the building.

01:32:03.474 --> 01:32:07.522
And at one point,
there was a whole section of
people stood up and cheered.

01:32:07.565 --> 01:32:10.960
And we were watching that
and it was Vladdy up there.

a standing ovation too,

clapping their sticks,

01:32:25.583 --> 01:32:28.586
to show their respect
they have for Vladdy.

01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:31.458
Kind of took everything
beyond the game of hockey.

01:32:42.252 --> 01:32:43.949
LARIONOV: Back to back,
I say it's not easy.

01:32:43.993 --> 01:32:45.864
Everybody knew
how hard for him,

01:32:45.908 --> 01:32:47.649
how easy for us.

01:32:47.692 --> 01:32:51.348
So that's why people
kind of give their
extra effort or him.

01:32:51.391 --> 01:32:55.570
It's our chance.
We have to win that game
no matter what.

01:33:06.711 --> 01:33:08.321
We just keep coming at it.

01:33:08.365 --> 01:33:11.542
Keep scoring.
Keep assisting each other.

01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:13.849
Shift in, shift out.

01:33:13.892 --> 01:33:16.068

Vladdy was in the stands.

It's the life in-between.
