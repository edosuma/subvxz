WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:06.340
RUSH: I may be on
 the verge of discovering

00:06.374 --> 00:09.810
the true nature of
 Destiny's mission.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.746
ELI: You've had
 control of this ship
 the whole time!

00:12.780 --> 00:14.482
Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

00:14.515 --> 00:18.152
The Lucian Alliance
 is planning an attack
 on Earth.

00:18.186 --> 00:21.155
YOUNG: I killed Riley.
 I suffocated him
 with my own hands.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.657
You are a good commander.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.427
YOUNG: There is no mission
 other than getting
 these people home.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.096
RUSH: It was never
 about going home,

00:28.129 --> 00:29.497
it's about getting us
 to where we're going.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.200
That is the mission.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.502
I've just been going over
 the shuttle's
 navigational data

00:34.535 --> 00:37.105
trying to figure out
 the path you took back
 to Destiny.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.207
It seems you were there,
 and then you were here.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.075
Nothing in between.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.710
Every square inch
 of this thing is in
 perfect factory condition.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.245
ELI: There's hundreds
 of these things!

00:44.278 --> 00:45.179
There's no way
 we're going to be able
 to shoot them all down!

00:45.213 --> 00:47.515
YOUNG: How's that
 damage report coming?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.049
RUSH: I'll arrange
 a briefing when we're ready,

00:49.083 --> 00:50.218
but it's not
 going to be pretty.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.019
CHLOE: I'm supposed
 to be back to normal.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.188
RUSH: You managed
 to retain some of
 the knowledge you gained.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.123
I should think
 that's a good thing.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.790
Because I can
 still be useful.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.059
Everyone on this ship
 is useful.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.462
We all belong here.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.867
All right,
somebody say something.
How bad is it?

01:06.900 --> 01:09.537
BRODY: It isn't
any one thing,
it's the accumulation.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.539
This ship just wasn't up
 to fighting a battle
 like that.

01:11.572 --> 01:15.075
A big chunk
of the life support
is still down, too.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.477
Well, you can
 repair it, right?

01:16.510 --> 01:18.312
BRODY: With what?

01:18.346 --> 01:20.481
Even if we knew how,
 we don't have
 the spare parts.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.717
I mean, I'm talking
 about things that are broken
 and burnt out,

01:23.751 --> 01:25.319
that I don't even know
 what they do.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.321
Now, if life support
 was our only problem

01:27.355 --> 01:28.889
we might be able to
 figure something out.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.125
But there are
 dozens of systems
 on the brink of failure.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.660
Weapons, shields...

01:32.693 --> 01:34.795
PARK: Well,
 they're operating.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.530
And at mission
critical levels?

01:37.798 --> 01:40.568
We are down
 to one last everything.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.669
There's practically
 no redundancy.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.103
"Practically no redundancy."

01:43.137 --> 01:44.572
Wasn't funny
 the first three times!

01:44.605 --> 01:45.806
Well, I'm very tired.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.209
Okay, we know what
the problems are.
What are the solutions?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.747
Well, what I think
 we're trying to say...

01:53.781 --> 01:56.350
We make do
as best we can and carry on
with the mission.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.486
Well, it doesn't sound
 like that's what they
 were trying to say.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.354
You're talking like
 we have a choice here.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.256
Actually...
 Eli, please...

02:02.290 --> 02:04.625
Ginn and I figured out

02:04.658 --> 02:06.760
how to dial
 the ninth chevron
 back to Earth

02:06.794 --> 02:09.463
while Destiny
 recharges in a star.

02:09.497 --> 02:10.698
Without blowing up
the ship, you mean?

02:10.731 --> 02:11.799
Yeah.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.367
No.
 Here we go.

02:13.401 --> 02:16.337
Look, Eli's solution
 however brilliant,

02:16.370 --> 02:18.606
fails to consider
the thousand things
that could go wrong

02:18.639 --> 02:20.641
when attempting to open
a wormhole in a star.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.443
I can show you
the simulation.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.645
More to the point,
 it could cause
 the same kind of overload

02:24.678 --> 02:26.314
that happened on Icarus.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.848
Well, who cares
 if we're not even going
 to be here?

02:27.881 --> 02:29.650
RUSH: Well,
 I do, Lieutenant.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.619
Along with anyone else
 who cares to remain
 aboard this ship.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.355
Rush, come on, man.
 Nobody in their
 right mind would stay.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.624
You said you understood
how important
this mission was.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.459
I did.
 So what's changed?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.461
Nicholas, you know
 what's changed.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.630
Look, I was
 all aboard with this,
 you know that,

02:42.663 --> 02:44.965
but if the ship can't fly,
 there is no mission.

02:44.998 --> 02:45.866
It's not like
 we're just giving up here.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.735
Well, that's exactly
 what we're doing.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.169
Well, fortunately for
 the people on this ship,

02:49.203 --> 02:50.671
the decision
 is not yours to make.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.406
Well, thankfully
 it's not your bloody
 decision either...

02:52.440 --> 02:53.841
Rush!
 We can get through this!

02:53.874 --> 02:56.244
They are just
 being defeatist!

02:56.277 --> 02:58.679
YOUNG: My first
 responsibility is the safety
 of these people.

02:59.747 --> 03:00.848
I'm sorry.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.585
Yeah, right.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.812
Oh, whoa.
 Stand aside, Sergeant.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.616
I can't do that.
 Colonel's orders.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.285
Since when?

03:37.318 --> 03:38.552
Just now.

03:39.987 --> 03:40.788
Did he say why?

03:41.755 --> 03:42.756
I didn't ask.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.227
Okay, could you tell me
 where else I've been
 banned from?

03:47.261 --> 03:48.562
Save me wasting my time.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.564
Pretty much any place
 that you can push buttons.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.866
Ah.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.735
And I've got people
 where all the buttons are.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.743
Destiny's course is
 taking us toward a star

04:02.776 --> 04:05.446
roughly 18 hours ahead,
 we assume to recharge.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.381
We should be ready.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.550
Oh, we've been ready
 for a long time.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.884
I'm ready,
 and I just got here.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.586
I can only imagine
what it's like for you.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.621
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

04:20.594 --> 04:22.796
Hi. We've been
 expecting you.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.765
Well, it seems
 you can predict
 my every move.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.735
Well, I had to make sure
you didn't lock us out
of the dialing programs.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.304
The thought never
crossed my mind.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.774
I see the elders
 have gathered.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.813
You should know
 Eli is using
 the stones right now

04:39.847 --> 04:41.915
to run his calculations
 by the best people on Earth.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.684
They'll tell him
 what I told him.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.786
The work is brilliant,
 but what works on paper

04:45.819 --> 04:48.422
does not necessarily
 work within a star.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.658
Well, Eli said
 that he's taken that
 into consideration.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.494
Eli is not
 an astrophysicist.

04:53.527 --> 04:57.465
Inside a star there
 are magnetic fields,

04:57.498 --> 05:00.468
enormous pressures,
 solar flares,

05:00.501 --> 05:04.972
conditions that make
 events unpredictable
 by any mathematics.

05:05.005 --> 05:08.542
Now, will Eli's connection
 to Earth work?

05:08.576 --> 05:10.378
Possibly.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.646
But what happens the moment
that wormhole has
been established

05:12.680 --> 05:14.382
is anybody's guess.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.350
It could blow a hole
 in the fabric of space-time.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.818
He's out
 of his freaking mind,
 you know that?

05:17.851 --> 05:20.988
All right. So, what are
you asking us to do?

05:22.556 --> 05:24.525
Let me talk to the crew.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.460
At least
 some of them understand
 how important it is

05:26.494 --> 05:27.961
to remain on this ship.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.897
Nobody is going
 to agree to that!

05:29.930 --> 05:34.001
You say you have
 no choice but to leave.
 I have no choice but to stay.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.338
We're going to brief everyone
 in the Gate Room

05:38.372 --> 05:39.640
the minute
we come out of FTL.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.976
You can address them then.

05:43.010 --> 05:46.547
It would carry
 far more weight if you
 were standing alongside me.

05:48.849 --> 05:49.917
I can do that.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.058
Thank you.

06:03.897 --> 06:04.898
You're not serious.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.868
Oh, I think he is.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.778
BRODY:
 We've run the simulation
 a dozen times. It works.

06:17.811 --> 06:21.048
So, the gamer came up
 with power flow algorithm?

06:21.081 --> 06:23.016
Eli, yeah.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.686
I gotta say, you know,
when we tried to solve this
back on Earth,

06:25.719 --> 06:28.689
there were a lot of
 smart people in that room.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.190
Yeah, well,
 don't tell him I said this,

06:30.223 --> 06:32.493
but he's arguably
 the smartest person
 I've ever met...

06:33.126 --> 06:34.462
You all right?

06:34.495 --> 06:35.729
I'm fine. I'm back.

06:35.763 --> 06:36.730
What did they say?

06:38.065 --> 06:39.500
The math works, so we're on.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.905
Who was the smartest person
 you were just talking about?

06:46.106 --> 06:47.407
Einstein.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.813
Einstein?

06:52.846 --> 06:55.148
Yeah, he was...
 He was pretty smart.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.885
But don't ever
tell him you said that?

06:57.918 --> 07:00.788
All right, come on,
 let's go tell
 the Colonel the news.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.085
Hey, T.J.,
 can you give us a minute?

07:32.119 --> 07:33.721
Yeah.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.591
Can you keep
 this ship flying?

07:37.625 --> 07:39.593
Yeah, with help.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.261
Then I need to know
 an absolute minimum
 number of personnel

07:41.294 --> 07:43.163
you need to do it.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.865
Well, as many
as possible, obviously.

07:44.898 --> 07:45.799
I need a number.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.836
I'll say a dozen.

07:48.869 --> 07:49.703
Plus you and me?

07:53.874 --> 07:55.776
No, including us.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.810
So, 10.

07:59.046 --> 08:01.549
Yeah, look,
 I've written down most
 of what I intend to say.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.016
If you've got anything
 you might want to add...

08:03.050 --> 08:05.619
TELFORD ON RADIO:
 Everett, is Rush in
 the Gate Room with you?

08:05.653 --> 08:06.854
Yeah, what is it?

08:06.887 --> 08:07.988
I need both of you
 on the bridge.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.723
We don't have time
 for this just now.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.992
David, we were just
 gonna talk to the crew.
 Can it wait?

08:12.025 --> 08:14.695
Negative! Get up here.
 Trust me.

08:14.728 --> 08:15.829
We have time.

08:17.665 --> 08:21.535
Yeah. Time they
 might need to decide.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.703
Just keep everyone here.
 We'll be right back.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.705
Uh, sure.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.082
What is it?

08:36.116 --> 08:37.317
VOLKER: It was in orbit
 around the star.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.053
Destiny picked it up
 when it turned towards us,

08:40.087 --> 08:41.889
and then we got
 the radio broadcast.

08:41.922 --> 08:42.789
From who?

08:43.857 --> 08:44.858
You.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.861
I don't understand.

08:47.895 --> 08:51.031
Neither do we.
 Wait for it.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.836
Wait for what?

08:55.869 --> 08:56.570
RUSH'S VOICE:
 I repeat, this is
 Dr. Nicholas Rush

08:56.604 --> 08:58.105
calling th Destiny.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.842
I'm aboard the shuttle
 headed your way.
 Please respond.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.745
Well, isn't this
 an interesting
 turn of events?

09:04.778 --> 09:06.847
What is this?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.750
Well,
 I wouldn't know, Colonel.
 How about you tell me?

09:09.783 --> 09:11.218
Well, it's not a recording,
 if that's what
 you're thinking.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.020
It's a subspace broadcast,

09:13.053 --> 09:14.922
and beyond the fact
 that it sounds
 exactly like Rush,

09:14.955 --> 09:17.124
I can tell that
that's our shuttle,

09:17.157 --> 09:19.092
and it's on
 an intercept course.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.261
TELFORD: Even though
 according to this,

09:21.294 --> 09:22.129
the shuttle is still
 docked with Destiny.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.364
Again, this is Dr. Rush.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.366
I need assistance
 with the docking procedure.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.768
I know you can hear me.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.072
Have we responded yet?

09:32.105 --> 09:33.573
No, not yet.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.276
Well, best not
 to keep me waiting.

09:41.348 --> 09:46.386
Hello, this is also
 Dr. Nicholas Rush.
 How can we be of assistance?

09:46.419 --> 09:49.156
RUSH'S VOICE: Tell them
 not to try and dial Earth.
 It won't work.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.058
If they go through with it,
 they're all going to die.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.761
This is Colonel Young.
 Dr. Rush is sitting
 right next to me.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.897
Yes, obviously.
 We've just spoken.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.766
The only reasonable
 explanation is that

09:58.799 --> 10:01.134
somehow I've come
 back through time.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.304
Reasonable explanation?

10:04.337 --> 10:07.307
I couldn't be sure
 until I seen you
 dropping out of FTL,

10:07.340 --> 10:10.811
which happened
 roughly 12 hours ago
 in my timeline.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.747
YOUNG: And we're supposed
 to just take your word
 for this?

10:13.781 --> 10:15.916
Shortly after we dropped out
 of FTL, Colonel,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.751
you asked me for a number.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.787
I told you 10, plus two.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.761
Twelve?

10:27.795 --> 10:29.096
That's well calculated,
 Mr. Volker,

10:29.129 --> 10:31.264
but I think you're
 missing the point here.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.000
Is that true?
 Did you just have
 that conversation?

10:33.033 --> 10:35.202
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.847
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

10:46.880 --> 10:50.350
It's weird. I was completely
 stoked about this mission.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.052
Yeah, we all were.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.888
All of a sudden I can't
wait to see my kid.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.858
Wow. Gosh,
 and I thought the hardest
 thing was going to be

10:57.891 --> 10:59.126
introducing you to my mom.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.728
Okay, that makes me
more nervous

11:00.761 --> 11:02.863
than going through
the dang gate.

11:02.896 --> 11:07.801
Hey, when we get back,
 we're all still
 gonna hang out, right?

11:07.835 --> 11:09.036
Yeah, of course we will.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.304
We will have
 a reunion every year.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.074
I was thinking more along
 the lines of Fridays.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.409
Depends on whether
 you're stationed Earth-side.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.312
I can guarantee you
 that Earth will be
 my station.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.981
But you're joining
 Stargate Command.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.850
(CHUCKLING) Like
 they're gonna ask me.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.319
They'll ask you, Eli.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.990
You'll be right up there
 with the other SGC brainiacs,

11:30.023 --> 11:32.225
like Dr. Jackson
 and Colonel Carter,

11:32.259 --> 11:35.028
and, uh, what was
 that guy's name who kept
 staring at your...

11:35.062 --> 11:36.730
Ugh, McKay.

11:36.764 --> 11:39.166
Yeah, McKay.
 They'll ask you
 right when we get back.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.368
YOUNG: Lieutenant Scott,
 come in.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.837
Yes, sir,
 is there a problem?

11:43.871 --> 11:46.774
Yeah. Join up with Greer,
 head to Shuttle Bay 2.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.097
Open it.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.433
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

12:22.175 --> 12:24.044
SCOTT: Easy!

12:24.077 --> 12:25.745
Don't listen to him!
 He's gonna try
 and kill you all!

12:34.021 --> 12:35.889
What in the hell?

12:35.923 --> 12:38.391
T.J., this is Young.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.060
Yes, sir,
 the gang's all here.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.394
Yeah, they're going
 to have to wait.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.463
We need you
 in the infirmary.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.970
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

12:58.812 --> 12:59.980
How did you get the burn?

13:00.013 --> 13:01.114
There was an overload.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.085
I couldn't stop it.

13:05.118 --> 13:09.189
Explosions all over the ship
 one after another.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.025
The air became so toxic,
 I had no choice
 but to abandon.

13:12.059 --> 13:15.362
And at which point,
 you somehow went back
 12 hours in time?

13:15.395 --> 13:19.266
No, no, no,
 that would have to happen
 inside the star.

13:19.299 --> 13:23.503
The ship itself
 must have passed
 very near a solar flare,

13:23.536 --> 13:26.306
in the exact moment
 we locked the ninth
 chevron address.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.375
A temporal event,
like we've seen,

13:28.408 --> 13:30.177
cause time travel
 through wormholes.

13:31.544 --> 13:32.880
It somehow
 affected the entire ship.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.216
One of those
 unpredictable things

13:36.249 --> 13:37.150
I remember
 warning you about.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.157
What are you smiling at?

13:44.191 --> 13:45.525
Well, you should know.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.528
What, fascinating, is it?

13:48.561 --> 13:49.496
Well, you wouldn't
 think so

13:49.529 --> 13:51.064
if you'd been through
what I've been through.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.000
Well, I won't have
 to now, will I?

13:53.033 --> 13:57.504
Look, we can still do this
 if we could just learn
 from your mistakes.

13:57.537 --> 14:00.473
My mistakes?
 The only mistake was trying
 it in the first place!

14:00.507 --> 14:02.209
No, no, wait a second,
 she's right.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.877
Just because it went wrong
 the first time round...

14:03.911 --> 14:06.179
Wait, isn't it
 the same time again?

14:06.213 --> 14:07.847
No, not entirely.

14:07.881 --> 14:10.317
We'd end up with two of us
 staying behind next time.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.384
If we kept going
 long enough,

14:11.418 --> 14:13.153
we'd soon have
 an entire crew.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.155
We still have an hour
 before we run Eli's program.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.991
Tell us what happened.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.894
Up to the point
 you received my radio signal,
 you know what happened.

14:20.928 --> 14:21.962
I need a number.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.531
I'll say a dozen.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.565
Plus you and me?

14:29.636 --> 14:31.671
No, including us.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.942
So, 10.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.210
Yeah, look,
 I've written down most
 of what I intend to say.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.445
If you've got anything
 you might want to add...

14:38.478 --> 14:42.082
So, I'll speak
 when you're done.
 But just so we're clear,

14:42.115 --> 14:43.550
if we don't get
 the 10 volunteers...

14:43.583 --> 14:44.985
We will.

14:45.986 --> 14:46.586
Okay.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.392
You were true
 to your word, Colonel.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.595
You stood alongside me.

14:55.628 --> 14:59.032
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have
your attention, please?

14:59.066 --> 15:01.334
Dr. Rush would like
to say a few words.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.141
My friends...

15:08.175 --> 15:09.076
(MAN CLEARS THROAT)

15:11.979 --> 15:16.116
Well, yes, perhaps
 that's an overstatement,

15:16.149 --> 15:19.252
but we are
 at least shipmates,

15:19.286 --> 15:23.423
who have, up until now,
shared great adversity.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.963
I know a lot of you,
 probably most of you,

15:29.997 --> 15:33.400
also share the hope
 of going home.

15:33.433 --> 15:37.637
It is a fact that
 the conditions inside a star

15:37.670 --> 15:41.241
bode very poorly
 for the sustained viability
 of a wormhole,

15:41.274 --> 15:43.343
and I owe it to you all
 to tell you that.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.145
Stop trying to scare people
 and get on with this.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.683
The Ancients did not devote

15:50.717 --> 15:55.355
the efforts of an entire
 generation to build this ship
 on a whim.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.625
Neither was Destiny
 named on a whim.

15:58.658 --> 16:02.129
Over a million years ago,

16:02.162 --> 16:05.298
the Ancients discovered
a complex structure

16:05.332 --> 16:08.001
buried deep within
 the background radiation,

16:08.035 --> 16:10.537
the fingerprints
 of an intelligence

16:10.570 --> 16:15.108
that existed
very near the beginning
of time itself.

16:15.142 --> 16:19.446
Desti was launched
 in search of
 that intelligence.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.781
Who knows how close
 we are to finding it?

16:21.814 --> 16:26.553
How close
we are to learning,
in the Ancients' words,

16:26.586 --> 16:30.190
"The destiny of all things."

16:30.223 --> 16:33.160
I don't pretend to know
 when that's going to be,

16:33.193 --> 16:36.463
in which stars
 it will happen,

16:36.496 --> 16:39.499
or even how that will change
 our view of the universe.

16:41.168 --> 16:45.038
I only know that
 Destiny has come this far,

16:45.072 --> 16:47.274
and if we abandon her now,

16:50.543 --> 16:52.679
there'll be no coming back.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.684
All of that knowledge
 will be lost forever.

16:59.352 --> 17:05.058
I believe this journey
 is the reason I'm here,

17:05.092 --> 17:07.094
but I can't hope
 to do it alone.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.563
I ask you to come with me.

17:14.300 --> 17:19.771
Now, I believe
 that those of you
 who want to go home

17:19.806 --> 17:21.674
deserve that chance.

17:21.708 --> 17:26.246
But I joined
 Stargate Command
 for a reason,

17:26.279 --> 17:29.382
so I, too,
 am willing to stay aboard.

17:31.818 --> 17:38.525
What we are looking for
are 10 volunteers,

17:38.558 --> 17:40.193
so I am asking,

17:40.227 --> 17:44.531
those of you
 who want to be here,

17:44.564 --> 17:46.299
please step forward.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.579
TELFORD: All right,
 listen to me!

18:32.612 --> 18:36.249
You've already accomplished
the damn mission!

18:36.283 --> 18:38.485
Our goal was to investigate
the ninth chevron address,

18:38.518 --> 18:41.588
and you've done that.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.823
Now, I do not deny that
 there once was a mission,

18:43.856 --> 18:46.459
but if it was as important
 as Rush claims it to be,

18:46.493 --> 18:49.162
they sure as hell
 couldn't expect us to do it.

18:49.196 --> 18:53.266
There is no noble voyage
 to save the universe
 or to meet God,

18:53.300 --> 18:55.702
or whatever it is
 that Rush has sold you on!

18:55.735 --> 18:58.505
There is only the day
 that this ship dies!

18:58.538 --> 19:01.941
David, we don't know that.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.544
I've got a good mind
 to try to take you all
 back by force.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.712
Good luck with that.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.820
Those of you
still taking part
in the evacuation

19:13.853 --> 19:16.689
are going
 to form two lines.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.625
Everything we carry with us
becomes a projectile

19:18.658 --> 19:20.960
in a nine-chevron transit,

19:20.993 --> 19:23.796
so we are going home with
 the clothes on our backs,
 nothing more.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.633
Eli has warned
 them to expect us,

19:26.666 --> 19:28.635
but it seems
that a radio signal

19:28.668 --> 19:31.471
does not reach across
 a nine chevron connection,

19:31.504 --> 19:34.474
so I'll go first
 to warn them that
 we're on our way.

19:34.507 --> 19:38.177
You will follow
 in three-second intervals,
 two at a time.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.413
Eli, are we ready?

19:40.447 --> 19:43.750
Yeah, the program's all set.
 You're good to go.

19:50.857 --> 19:55.395
Fifteen minutes, people,
 and we go home!

19:57.230 --> 20:00.367
And 15 minutes after that,
 you were dead.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.505
If all those people
 stayed aboard,

20:05.538 --> 20:06.839
why were you
the only survivor?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.441
I told you,
 there was an overload.

20:08.475 --> 20:12.379
It doesn't matter.
 We have a second chance now.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.913
You just need to
 tell us what went wrong,

20:13.946 --> 20:15.848
what can we do differently.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.352
Eli's program
 is based on precise timing
 in the recharging process.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.020
A time which is
 fast approaching.

20:21.053 --> 20:24.457
All right, so you dialed
 the ninth chevron and...

20:24.491 --> 20:26.893
And it worked.
We made the connection.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.755
Chevron nine is locked!

21:01.428 --> 21:02.929
Wait three seconds,
then follow me!

25:04.236 --> 25:05.738
(SCOFFS) Safely.

25:05.772 --> 25:08.575
I think now we all
 need to be on the bridge.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.977
Oh, well,
 at least I'll have someone

25:11.010 --> 25:12.244
to engage in
 a decent conversation.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.996
There it is.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.231
YOUNG: Well, I think
 that's confirmation,
 don't you?

25:32.264 --> 25:34.333
We're altering
 course and accelerating.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.802
But we're close enough
 to get a decent look at her.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.271
There but for
 the grace of God, huh?

26:12.304 --> 26:13.305
It's my fault.

26:15.107 --> 26:19.912
Everybody on that ship
 died because of me.

26:19.946 --> 26:23.716
Yeah, well, the only reason
 we're even in this situation

26:23.750 --> 26:25.752
is because you were all
 trying to save me.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.687
Do you guys see what I see?

26:28.254 --> 26:29.956
What?

26:29.989 --> 26:32.892
The damage
 is confined mostly to
 the engineering spaces.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.761
The main living compartments
 look intact.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.829
So?

26:36.863 --> 26:38.297
I've got an idea.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.803
Out of the way,
out of the way!
Move, move, move!

26:49.341 --> 26:51.610
You just said it was
 falling back toward the star.

26:51.644 --> 26:53.079
That was me, actually.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.681
Okay...

26:54.714 --> 26:57.249
I'm telling you,
 we need to get
 over to that ship.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.085
It might be worth
the risk if we can
salvage ammunition,

26:59.118 --> 27:00.086
food, supplies...

27:00.119 --> 27:02.922
No, no, that's not
 what he's talking about...

27:02.955 --> 27:04.123
Well, what is it, then?

27:04.156 --> 27:06.025
Spare parts.
 I had the same idea.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.995
I ran the whole way,
 too, so... (PANTING)

27:12.298 --> 27:14.100
Hmm.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.035
How much time do we have
 before we're out of range?

27:16.068 --> 27:18.771
Well, we can't take
 a shuttle, the other ship
 is too close to the star,

27:18.805 --> 27:20.873
and Destiny
is accelerating away.

27:20.907 --> 27:23.943
We can arrange
a short FTL jump,
use the stargate.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.312
It's the same gate.
 Can it dial itself?

27:26.345 --> 27:28.214
I don't see why not.

27:28.247 --> 27:31.117
Destiny's address
isn't based on
a fixed point in space.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.952
We'll have to input
 the distance calculation,

27:32.985 --> 27:36.989
but you guys should be able
to work that out, right?

27:37.023 --> 27:40.292
Yeah, between me,
 Eli, and me.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.461
All right, well,
 let's, uh, let's start
 putting together a list.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.763
Yeah.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.465
I'd like to lead
 the team over there.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.001
I should go as well.
 I'm the only one who knows

27:49.035 --> 27:50.202
which systems were affected
by the overload.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.804
Listen, Rush,
 I don't even know

27:51.838 --> 27:53.039
if that's what
 I should call you.

27:53.072 --> 27:54.406
Well, it is my name.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.042
Fine. What I'm trying
 to say is that

27:56.075 --> 27:57.409
you've been
 through hell and back.

27:57.443 --> 27:58.978
You don't got to do this.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.313
The man wants
to help, Everett,
let him help.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.115
We're gonna need
 all hands for this.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.289
Okay.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.998
These are priority
 number one!

28:19.031 --> 28:21.267
We want as many
as we can get our hands on.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.936
This one's burnt out.
 This one's good.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.404
Now, they're
 in every console,
 power relay,

28:25.437 --> 28:27.840
and pretty much
 every piece of equipment
 aboard the ship.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.942
Open 'em up,
pull 'em out and move on.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.243
What do you call
 those things?

28:31.277 --> 28:34.080
I don't know...
 "Things that make it go."

28:34.113 --> 28:37.283
We should find concentrations
 of working parts
 in the bridge,

28:37.316 --> 28:40.186
control interface
and neural interface rooms.

28:40.219 --> 28:43.055
Number two, these things,
 and don't ask me
 what they're called.

28:43.089 --> 28:45.357
I'm not even sure
 how they work.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.860
We also have to get
 our hands on the other
 repair robot,

28:47.894 --> 28:49.195
and shield emitter relays.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.063
We'll get everything
 on the list.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.866
If there's still time,
 we'll move on to our
 secondary objectives.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.434
Yeah, how much time
do we have?

28:55.467 --> 28:57.369
We'll assess
 that once we're aboard.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.872
The conditions
will be difficult
and they will be dangerous,

28:59.906 --> 29:02.909
but make no mistake,
we need to salvage
these things

29:02.942 --> 29:04.911
if we are going to survive.

29:08.981 --> 29:11.250
Dial the gate.
Everyone step back.

29:11.283 --> 29:12.418
(DIALING GATE)

29:15.521 --> 29:16.755
Send the Kino.

29:31.103 --> 29:35.441
It's getting hot already,
 but the air is
 still breathable.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.243
I'd call it a green light.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.444
Let's move.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.064
(ALARM BLARING IN DISTANCE)

30:05.204 --> 30:06.805
Form into your teams
 and standby.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.848
Okay, I'm reading power
and life support

30:15.882 --> 30:18.184
in both the bridge
and Control Interface Room.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.319
Forty minutes till
 the shield fails.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.521
TELFORD: Then that's
 the time we have.

30:22.554 --> 30:23.522
Lieutenant, that means
 your team heads straight
 to the armory.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.024
Got it.

30:25.057 --> 30:28.294
You know your assignments,
 let's go!

30:28.327 --> 30:30.296
This is Telford.
 We are proceeding.
 40 minutes on the clock.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.830
Okay, let's go.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.066
David, be careful.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.001
Will do.

30:57.389 --> 31:00.059
Someone should report
 to Homeworld Command,

31:00.092 --> 31:01.327
explain what's
 been going on.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.528
Well, you go ahead,
 and when you're back,

31:02.561 --> 31:04.563
you can explain it to me.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.200
They must think
we're all dead.

31:09.468 --> 31:10.502
It didn't happen.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.437
Yeah, it did.

31:11.470 --> 31:12.939
Not to us, Eli.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.041
You can say
 anything you like.

31:15.074 --> 31:17.276
Tell me to take
one timeline at a time,

31:17.309 --> 31:21.247
but if Rush wasn't sent back
 by a freak of physics,

31:21.280 --> 31:23.049
we'd all be dead by now.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.891
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

31:48.407 --> 31:50.376

31:50.409 --> 31:52.078
VOLKER: Over here, guys.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.584

 get that alarm off?

32:31.150 --> 32:32.518
Guess we're not
going in there.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.775
So, this must be
 pretty weird
 for you two, huh?

32:56.808 --> 32:57.976
Yes.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.117
Half the ones
 I'm pulling are burnt out
 from the overload.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.785
I'll take what we can get.

33:06.818 --> 33:10.356
Go get your CO2 nodes.
 We need to breathe, too.

33:10.389 --> 33:11.990

 you're with me.

33:15.261 --> 33:18.797
That's half time,
 start packing it up!

33:18.830 --> 33:21.500
Get back to the stargate,
 quickly as you can. Go!

33:25.537 --> 33:27.139
Gettin' hot, huh?

33:27.173 --> 33:28.274
Yeah, but it's a dry heat.

33:29.841 --> 33:30.609
(RUMBLING)

33:37.783 --> 33:39.685
All right, that's it,
 we're out of here. Move.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.291
Get back to the Gate Room.
 Double time!

33:48.427 --> 33:49.528
How we doing?

33:49.561 --> 33:50.662
We eat tonight.

33:50.696 --> 33:51.763
Excellent. Get out of here.

33:51.797 --> 33:53.031
Pack it up.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.534
Come on, let's go.

33:58.237 --> 33:59.538
All right,
 that's it, let's go!

34:13.418 --> 34:15.221
What do you think?

34:15.254 --> 34:16.487
I think it's not
on our list.

34:21.327 --> 34:25.397
It could double
 the amount of weapons
 we could bring online.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.866
Do we even have time
 for this?

34:27.899 --> 34:30.202
Colonel, we've come across
 a piece of equipment

34:30.235 --> 34:32.371
that could
 significantly increase
 our weapons capability,

34:32.404 --> 34:33.804
but we're up
 against the clock.

34:33.839 --> 34:35.873
TELFORD: For that,
 we should risk it!

34:35.907 --> 34:37.243
For once, he agrees with me.

34:39.610 --> 34:43.114
Okay, I'll go
and I'll bring back
the proper tools.

34:43.149 --> 34:44.882
Be careful not to touch
the damaged one.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.552
About 1000 volts
 running through that.

34:46.585 --> 34:47.518
Do you think
 I might know that?

35:05.504 --> 35:09.408
Didn't mean to sneak
 up on you. This is it?

35:09.441 --> 35:13.245
Yeah. The others
took the parts we had
back to the Gate Room.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.846
My younger self is
 coming back to help,

35:14.880 --> 35:16.915
but I don't want
 to wait for him.

35:16.948 --> 35:17.816
You don't trust
 him either, huh?

35:20.152 --> 35:21.487
So what went wrong?

35:21.520 --> 35:23.855
(SIGHS) What are
 you talking about?

35:23.889 --> 35:25.591
Not that I think you would
kill them all deliberately.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.693
I tried to save them!

35:27.726 --> 35:29.661
You don't think
I buy that story?

35:29.695 --> 35:31.430
Rush valiantly
 keeping the gate open

35:31.463 --> 35:33.432
while the ship
 explodes all around him?

35:33.465 --> 35:34.933
I don't care
what you think.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.702
It wouldn't
 be the first time
 you sabotaged the ship

35:36.735 --> 35:37.803
to make an ass
out of me, would it?

35:37.836 --> 35:39.438
The last time
 we tried to dial Earth

35:39.471 --> 35:41.340
from inside

 among others.

35:42.641 --> 35:43.942
The wormhole was unstable!

I'm talking about
 what really happened.

Their blood is on
 your hands, not mine.

35:47.479 --> 35:50.282
They would all
 have made it home,
 but you did something!

35:50.316 --> 35:52.150
I was trying
 to buy them some time!

35:52.184 --> 35:54.286
Oh, and there's not
 a single person left alive
 to confirm that...

35:54.320 --> 35:56.355
Get your hands off of me!
 You're the coward!

35:56.388 --> 35:58.290
You're the one
 who didn't believe
 in the mission!

35:58.324 --> 36:00.192
You're the one
 that killed them!

36:01.193 --> 36:02.594

 right over here!

36:42.268 --> 36:44.236
Hey, Rush,
 where's your other, uh...

36:44.270 --> 36:45.504
He's found something
 for the weapons systems.

36:45.537 --> 36:46.572
There's no time!
 We still have time.

36:46.605 --> 36:47.673
I'm just going
 back to help.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.540
All right,
 I'll go with you!

36:48.574 --> 36:50.709
Dial the gate
 and keep it open for us.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.478
T.J., get these people
 out of here.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.847
Don't stay too long!

36:55.881 --> 36:57.716
All right, everybody,
 move out, we're going
 to dial the gate!

36:59.318 --> 37:01.219
They're dialing back.

37:01.253 --> 37:03.789
Good. That was fast.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.591
I wasn't finished reporting,

37:05.624 --> 37:08.026
but when Colonel Telford
 found out that we were
 still here,

37:08.059 --> 37:10.796
he insisted
 that he be allowed
 to use the stones

37:10.829 --> 37:14.400
to switch with someone,
 preferably himself.

37:14.433 --> 37:15.934
That's weird.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.436
Yeah, well, that can wait.
 At least they know
 we're alive.

where the hell are you?

SCOTT: Going after something
 that's supposed to double

37:51.036 --> 37:52.504
the weapons capability, sir.

37:52.538 --> 37:54.573
Negative. You don't
 have time for that.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.308
I need you to locate
 Colonel Telford.

37:56.342 --> 37:57.776
He's not answering
 his radio.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.845
Roger that, sir,
 we're comin' right around...

38:01.613 --> 38:02.814
Scott, say again?
You were cut off.

38:06.017 --> 38:08.354
We found the Colonel, sir.
 He's dead.

38:13.859 --> 38:16.662

38:16.695 --> 38:18.864
He's right beside me.
 I don't know where
 the other one is.

38:18.897 --> 38:19.798
I do.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.967
Hey, hey, Rush!

38:24.336 --> 38:25.971
Sir, Rush just
 ran off on me.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.106
Let him go.
 Sir!

38:28.139 --> 38:29.941
You only have a few minutes
before the shield fails.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.743
Let him go, that is
 an order, Lieutenant.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.333
It was an accident.

38:57.002 --> 39:00.772
I believe you,
 but they won't.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.574
No.

39:05.611 --> 39:08.079
Tell me, when you,
 uh, dialed Earth,

39:10.081 --> 39:11.617
what really happened?

39:14.019 --> 39:15.554
I told you what happened.

39:19.891 --> 39:22.728
And so now
 you're trying to decide

39:22.761 --> 39:24.830
whether or not
 to sit in that chair.

39:24.863 --> 39:25.864
Well, wouldn't you,
in my place?

 if even the knowledge

39:30.035 --> 39:31.036
of the Ancients
 can help you now.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.375
Well, I really
don't have anything
to lose at this point.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.847
Imagine what I could learn.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.949
Well, you won't
 have much time.

39:43.982 --> 39:47.419
Well, time's relative.
We've just proved that,
haven't we?

39:50.055 --> 39:50.989
So, what are
you waiting for?

39:53.492 --> 39:54.626
I need your help.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.415
Thank you.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.518
Goodbye.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.639
(EXPLOSION)

40:56.021 --> 40:57.956
Come on, come on, come on!

41:18.577 --> 41:19.177
You're welcome.

41:21.513 --> 41:23.749
(PANTING) I'm okay, I'm okay.

41:26.985 --> 41:27.986
Nicholas.

41:28.920 --> 41:29.855
Yeah?

41:32.190 --> 41:33.592
Where's the other Rush?

41:35.160 --> 41:36.494
I don't know.

41:36.528 --> 41:37.996
You told Scott
you knew where he went.

41:38.029 --> 41:40.498
I was wrong.
 I went looking for him,
 couldn't find him.

41:40.532 --> 41:42.500
Maybe he decided
to go down with his ship.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.136
That doesn't sound like me.

41:45.170 --> 41:48.640
Still, you must, uh...
 You must be pleased
 about one thing.

41:48.674 --> 41:50.141
What's that?

41:50.175 --> 41:52.544
Well, we can fix the ship,
 get on with the mission.

41:55.681 --> 41:56.848
Yeah, of course.

42:00.619 --> 42:02.688
Get on with the mission.

43:26.672 --> 43:27.605
