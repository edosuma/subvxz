01:36.529 --> 01:38.230
     This damned headache.      

01:38.264 --> 01:40.699
      I've had it all day.      
I can't seem to shake it.       

01:40.734 --> 01:42.868
             Oh, you know, those
             dilated veins there

01:42.902 --> 01:45.604
        will just add to your   
          discomfort there, Doc.

01:45.638 --> 01:47.306
On the other hand,              
there is a possibility          

01:47.340 --> 01:49.241
that what you have              
is not a headache at all        

01:49.275 --> 01:51.276
but rather an earwig            
that's crawled                  

01:51.311 --> 01:53.846
into your auditory canal        
while you were asleep           

01:53.880 --> 01:56.148
and who is                      
at this very moment,            

01:56.182 --> 01:59.184
uh, chewing its way             
through your cerebral cortex.   

02:00.487 --> 02:02.988
         Sam, may I have a glass
            of water, please?   

02:03.023 --> 02:05.224
             I... I'll just take
                another aspirin.

02:05.258 --> 02:06.592
      That ought to do it.      

02:06.626 --> 02:08.426
             Frasier, hold it, I
            know just the thing.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.162
        I'm really good         
          at massage.           

02:10.196 --> 02:12.831
Just sit down,                  
relax...                        

02:18.471 --> 02:20.339
There--                         
how is that?                    

02:20.373 --> 02:21.640
            (hoarse):           
        I didn't get any water. 

02:23.843 --> 02:25.477
Carla, can I ask you            
a favor?                        

02:25.512 --> 02:26.545
                  No, Woody, I'm
                    not going   

02:26.579 --> 02:27.913
                 to work for you
                 this afternoon.

02:27.947 --> 02:29.314
              I've already taken
              over your schedule

02:29.349 --> 02:31.583
          for the past couple of
    days, and I'm sick of it.   

02:31.618 --> 02:32.785
            You can just tell   
                 your girlfriend

02:32.819 --> 02:33.852
                  you'll see her
                     after work.

02:33.887 --> 02:34.987
Well, actually,                 
I was gonna ask                 

02:35.021 --> 02:36.422
if you could get                
off my foot.                    

02:38.158 --> 02:39.091
                    Oh.         

02:40.794 --> 02:43.362
  Speaking of shifts, Sam, uh,  
    can I leave early?          

02:43.396 --> 02:45.230
             Kelly hates it when
            I'm late for a date.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.732
              Henri doesn't care
            for it much, either.

02:46.766 --> 02:49.134
Henri?                          
That slick French               

02:49.169 --> 02:51.770
make-out artist always trying to
grab other people's women       

02:51.805 --> 02:53.005
     with some phony line?      

02:53.039 --> 02:54.506
        Yeah, that's the guy.   

02:54.541 --> 02:58.143
I always                        
liked that guy.                 

02:58.178 --> 02:59.478
            Yeah, well, Kelly   
                 likes him, too.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.313
                He goes on every
                date with us.   

03:01.348 --> 03:03.015
Yeah, well, just                
as long as he's stopped         

03:03.049 --> 03:05.217
making those jokes              
about stealing Kelly from you.  

03:05.251 --> 03:06.618
            He has?             

03:06.653 --> 03:08.487
         Why didn't you         
      tell me sooner, Sam?      
                         No, no.

03:08.521 --> 03:09.822
      I hate those jokes.       
                        No...   

03:09.856 --> 03:11.690
        Woody, I don't know that
      he has, I was just asking.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.059
    Oh.                         

03:14.094 --> 03:17.162
Hey, Sam, I hear you're getting 
a big refund from the IRS.      

03:17.197 --> 03:18.364
             I am?              

03:18.398 --> 03:20.733
          Two can play          
     that little game, Sam.     

03:23.503 --> 03:25.137
    Oh, there you are,          
        my poor darling.        

03:25.171 --> 03:27.473
      And you've still got      
  your headache, haven't you?   

03:27.507 --> 03:29.708
Oh, I can see                   
it's gotten worse               

03:29.743 --> 03:32.745
by those tiny little pressure   
wrinkles around your eyes.      

03:32.779 --> 03:35.948
Maybe that's just               
fatty tissue.                   

03:35.982 --> 03:38.150
                  It'll go away.

03:38.184 --> 03:40.152
      Oh, no, no, once you      
      get those fat bags,       

03:40.186 --> 03:41.353
     they're there to stay.     

03:42.422 --> 03:44.356
Describe the pain               
to me.                          

03:44.391 --> 03:46.225
Is it a sharp,                  
stabbing pain?                  

03:46.259 --> 03:47.793
Is it a dull ache?              

03:47.827 --> 03:49.528
Is it a                         
pressure headache?              

03:49.562 --> 03:50.896
Or is it a                      
throbbing headache,             

03:50.930 --> 03:52.598
one that just pounds            
and pounds                      

03:52.632 --> 03:54.233
and pounds                      
and pounds...                   

03:54.267 --> 03:55.701
            Lilith, if you don't
                stop it, my head

03:55.735 --> 03:57.336
             is going to explode
              all over this bar!

03:57.370 --> 03:58.504
                      All right!

03:58.538 --> 04:00.773
                      Hey, Paul,
                get out here!   

04:00.807 --> 04:03.008
Frasier,                        
I'm concerned.                  

04:03.043 --> 04:05.177
I think it's time we            
tried alternative medicine.     

04:05.211 --> 04:07.212
          No, no, I am not going
            to wear a crystal   

04:07.247 --> 04:08.580
            or dissolve herbs   
                 under my tongue

04:08.615 --> 04:10.816
  or listen to some aging hippie
        playing the whale flute.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.084
That's not why                  

04:12.118 --> 04:13.352
              I went to college,
                    although,   

04:13.386 --> 04:15.487
         when I went to college,
         I did all those things.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.623
 I'm talking about acupuncture. 

04:17.656 --> 04:18.656
                      No, never!

04:18.692 --> 04:20.858
It's worked for thousands       
        of years.               

04:20.894 --> 04:22.828
The Chinese people              
have been practicing it         

04:22.862 --> 04:24.630
since the Stone Age.            

04:24.664 --> 04:26.532
Why do you insist               
on closing your mind            

04:26.566 --> 04:27.766
to such a                       
time-honored remedy?            

04:27.801 --> 04:29.668
              'Cause it'll hurt!

04:29.703 --> 04:31.170
I'm calling Dr. Lee.            

04:32.238 --> 04:33.939
                      How's your
              headache, Frasier?

04:33.973 --> 04:35.574
    Oh, fine.                   

04:35.608 --> 04:37.843
She's into alternative          
medicines these days.           

04:40.313 --> 04:41.447
                          WOODY:
                     Hey, Henri.

04:41.481 --> 04:42.715
             Kelly.             

04:42.749 --> 04:45.017
                 Woody, I have a
                 riddle for you.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.919
                        How long
                    will it take

04:46.953 --> 04:48.854
                 for me to steal
                your girlfriend?

04:48.888 --> 04:50.789
        I give up.              

04:50.824 --> 04:53.692
         Then it won't          
    take long at all.           

04:53.727 --> 04:55.227
    Such an operator,           
    it makes me sick.           

04:55.261 --> 04:57.363
Yeah, it makes me mad           
just to look at him.            

04:57.397 --> 04:58.530
        Hello, fellows!         

04:58.565 --> 05:00.833
              ALL:              
Hey, Henri, how you doing?      

05:00.867 --> 05:02.668
 Hey, Henri, how are you doing? 

05:02.702 --> 05:05.871
Sam, how is my favorite         
American chaser of women?       

05:05.905 --> 05:08.007
            No, I'm not doing   
            that anymore, Henri.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.975
     You know, I... I've reached
        that point in my life   

05:10.010 --> 05:12.711
         where my priorities are
             beginning to shift.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.381
        I think I want to settle
        down and raise a family.

05:15.415 --> 05:18.751
Ooh, that's a good line.        
Does it work?                   

05:18.785 --> 05:20.019
              No, no, no, I'm...

05:20.053 --> 05:21.820
              I'm really serious
              about this, Henri.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.355
            I... I'm gonna go   
              through with this.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.323
Sammy, don't worry,             

05:24.357 --> 05:25.958
I will not steal                
your precious line.             

05:25.992 --> 05:26.959
                      No.       

05:26.993 --> 05:28.494
              You... you gotta  
                 understand...  

05:28.528 --> 05:29.862
     Hey, Henri.                

05:29.896 --> 05:31.764
          I've got a letter here
      for you-- looks important.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.699
          I even had to sign for
              it and everything.

05:33.733 --> 05:36.101
Henri, why are you getting      
        your mail here?         

05:36.136 --> 05:38.437
  Because I feel this           
is my second home,              

05:38.471 --> 05:42.541
    and sometimes I             
get letters postage due.        

05:42.575 --> 05:44.109
                Oh, <i>mon dieu.</i>   

05:45.211 --> 05:46.945
KELLY:                          
Oh, no.                         

05:46.980 --> 05:47.913
                     What is it?

05:47.947 --> 05:49.715
     Oh, this is terrible.      

05:49.749 --> 05:51.050
                    Henri's visa
                    has expired,

05:51.184 --> 05:53.452
         and he has to leave the
            country in two days.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.621
                Help me out with
            the "terrible" part.

05:55.655 --> 05:59.591
I am being kicked out,          
just because I                  

05:59.626 --> 06:01.960
am not a citizen                
and I have no job               

06:01.995 --> 06:03.762
and I have no prospect          
for a job                       

06:03.797 --> 06:06.131
and I have no wish              
for a job.                      

06:06.166 --> 06:07.132
                  Wait a minute,
                they can kick   

06:07.167 --> 06:08.233
                  you out of the
            country for that?   

06:08.268 --> 06:11.136
No, no, relax, you...           
you were born here.             

06:11.171 --> 06:13.972
              God bless America.
            Hey, amen.          

06:15.108 --> 06:18.010
        Oh, I will miss         
      this great country.       

06:18.044 --> 06:19.645
  I have been in love with it   

06:19.679 --> 06:21.780
          ever since I          
      got my first glimpse      

06:21.815 --> 06:24.283
  of that big, beautiful woman  
         in the harbor.         

06:24.317 --> 06:25.284
    Ah, yeah,                   

06:25.318 --> 06:26.985
Lady Liberty.                   

06:27.020 --> 06:29.722
                 She told me her
                  name was Kiki.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.994
Oh, Woody, isn't this           
the worst news ever?            

06:36.029 --> 06:37.629
Aren't you                      
gonna miss Henri?               

06:38.965 --> 06:42.134
            Yeah, it's the worst
        news I've ever heard.   

06:42.202 --> 06:43.369
                     Hey, Henri,

06:43.403 --> 06:45.437
sorry to see you go--           
don't be a stranger.            

06:45.472 --> 06:46.972
Woody Boyd,                     

06:47.007 --> 06:49.241
why are your hands              
behind your back?               

06:49.275 --> 06:50.976
Are you                         
making crossies?                

06:53.079 --> 06:55.047
                  Well, if I was
                making crossies,

06:55.081 --> 06:56.615
            then I could tell   
              you that I wasn't,

06:56.649 --> 06:57.983
                     and I still
              wouldn't be lying,

06:58.018 --> 07:01.487
              so, Kelly, no, I'm
            not making crossies.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.290
Oh, Woody.                      

07:05.325 --> 07:08.227
Stop it, Kelly, I hate it       
      when you yell at me.      

07:08.261 --> 07:09.561
I don't think you               
know how much                   

07:09.596 --> 07:11.797
Henri loves this country,       
and for you                     

07:11.831 --> 07:15.501
  to stand there and act happy  
  that poor Henri is leaving.   

07:15.535 --> 07:17.136
Well,                           

07:17.170 --> 07:18.237
         that's just...         

07:19.539 --> 07:21.106
                          Kelly,

07:21.141 --> 07:23.976
        try to control yourself,
         this is a public place.

07:24.010 --> 07:27.446
    Oh, Kelly, do not           
      be angry with Woody.      

07:27.480 --> 07:29.682
    I have not always           
     played fair with him.      

07:29.716 --> 07:31.150
Ah, well,                       

07:31.184 --> 07:34.086
          maybe in another time,
            in another place,   

07:34.120 --> 07:35.621
                we could have   
                been friends.   

07:35.655 --> 07:37.990
                 Oh, gee, Henri.

07:38.024 --> 07:41.260
    Yes, I will miss America,   
            but you know, Woody,

07:41.294 --> 07:43.128
                I will miss <i>you</i> 
                    most of all,

07:43.163 --> 07:46.965
because to me,                  
you <i>are</i> America.                

07:47.000 --> 07:49.702
            You are what this   
        country is all about,   

07:49.736 --> 07:53.138
            and now I will never
            see it or you again.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.074
          <i>Adieu.</i>                

07:58.044 --> 08:00.245
  What kind of a country is it  
        that kicks a guy        

08:00.280 --> 08:03.115
          like him out          
  and lets a guy like me stay?  

08:03.149 --> 08:05.718
 I'll tell you what country...  

08:05.752 --> 08:08.420
        U.S.A.! U.S.A.!         

08:08.455 --> 08:11.357
              ALL:              
        U.S.A.! U.S.A.!         

08:15.395 --> 08:17.262
Hey, Woody,                     
what you doing?                 

08:17.297 --> 08:19.932
         Well, now that Henri's 
        going back to Europe... 
    Yeah?                       

08:19.966 --> 08:21.800
                I can finally be
            alone with Kelly.   

08:21.835 --> 08:23.669
                  I can look her
                     in the eyes

08:23.703 --> 08:25.771
         and let all my feelings
         pour out spontaneously.

08:25.805 --> 08:26.839
    Yeah.                       

08:26.873 --> 08:29.708
             I have them written
            down on these cards.

08:29.743 --> 08:30.809
                When I ask Kelly
                    to marry me,

08:30.844 --> 08:32.044
                    I want to   
                get it right.   

08:32.078 --> 08:34.145
              I better put these
             in my hiding place.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.714
Well, how come you              
have to hide them?              

08:35.749 --> 08:36.914
Carla got a hold                
of them once.                   

08:36.950 --> 08:38.549
You should have seen            
what she had me saying          

08:38.585 --> 08:40.052
on card nine--                  
I couldn't even pronounce it.   

08:40.086 --> 08:41.754
                             Oh.
Give me a boost, Sam.           

08:41.788 --> 08:43.288
            Oh, hold on.        

08:43.323 --> 08:44.222
                Here we go.     
  All right.                    

08:44.256 --> 08:45.824
        (grunting)              

08:45.859 --> 08:47.059
     All right.                 

08:47.093 --> 08:48.527
Okay, I got it.                 

08:48.561 --> 08:51.063
    Hey, look,                  
    here's my wallet.           

08:54.734 --> 08:57.403
I left this thing up here       
six months ago.                 

08:57.437 --> 08:59.805
See, I never even thought       
to look up there.               

08:59.839 --> 09:04.910
All right,                      
I can drive again!              

09:04.944 --> 09:07.046
                        Oh, God.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.882
Ah, that headache's still       
bothering you, huh, Fras?       

09:09.916 --> 09:11.550
            Oh, yes.            
Yep.                            

09:11.584 --> 09:13.419
      What do those things      
    feel like, anyway?          

09:13.453 --> 09:15.554
          You've never          
     had a headache, Norm?      

09:15.588 --> 09:16.955
    I don't think so.           

09:17.057 --> 09:18.223
How... how do you get one?      

09:20.260 --> 09:21.927
 Oh, it's a variety of reasons. 

09:21.961 --> 09:23.562
Usually stress or tension.      

09:23.596 --> 09:24.563
              Hmm?              

09:25.932 --> 09:29.234
     Job-related anxieties,     
     day-to-day pressures.      

09:29.269 --> 09:31.170
          Come again?           

09:31.204 --> 09:32.705
        It's like, um...        

09:32.739 --> 09:34.640
when you eat ice cream too fast.

09:34.674 --> 09:36.675
        Oh, I hate that.        

09:40.046 --> 09:42.247
    Frasier, I've got           
        Dr. Lee outside.        

09:42.282 --> 09:43.849
             Lilith, I thought I
         made it perfectly clear

09:43.883 --> 09:45.684
                 that I will not
          submit to acupuncture!

09:45.719 --> 09:47.619
Well, then, perhaps you'll      
        allow the doctor        

09:47.654 --> 09:50.089
    to practice acupressure,    
        a simple massage        

09:50.123 --> 09:51.657
        using the body's        
        pressure points.        

09:51.691 --> 09:53.058
No, I'm not having              
some spooky quack               

09:53.093 --> 09:54.793
practice the mysteries          
of the Orient on my body!       

09:57.197 --> 09:58.697
                        FRASIER:
                         Well...

09:58.732 --> 10:02.401
 you know, Lilith, perhaps I'm  
  being a bit too Eurocentric.  

10:02.435 --> 10:04.069
    Right this way, Dr. Lee.    

10:04.104 --> 10:08.073
 So, I understand you're having 
a little problem with headaches?

10:08.108 --> 10:09.141
                        Oh, yes.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.276
    You are going to, um...     

10:11.311 --> 10:13.212
warm the oil, aren't you?       

10:17.951 --> 10:19.351
                Hello, Woody.   

10:19.386 --> 10:22.354
Woody, you are so sweet         
to see Henri off.               

10:22.389 --> 10:24.456
        Well, that's just the   
            way I was raised.   

10:24.491 --> 10:26.158
            So, Henri, what time
                 does your plane

10:26.192 --> 10:27.726
                  leave American
                    airspace?   

10:28.995 --> 10:30.696
          Yeah, personally,     
         I say good riddance.   

10:30.730 --> 10:32.398
                        Yeah?   
     Yeah, then the charms      
         of the French          

10:32.432 --> 10:33.499
            have always         
          been lost on me.      

10:33.533 --> 10:34.900
    I mean, when W.W. Three     
         rolls around,          

10:34.934 --> 10:36.902
          they'd better not come
             to old Cliff Clavin

10:36.936 --> 10:39.171
    to pull their fromage out   
         of the fire, no, siree!

10:39.205 --> 10:41.407
                 I've got plans.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.275
                Yeah, when those
          missiles start flying,

10:43.309 --> 10:45.177
                    I'll be in a
            fully stocked-up,   

10:45.211 --> 10:47.880
            juiced-up Winnebago,
              heading at 65 per,

10:47.914 --> 10:50.315
    armed to the teeth, right   
        to the border of Mexico.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.184
Yes, sir.                       

10:52.218 --> 10:53.852
            Those cockroaches   
                and Cliff Clavin

10:53.887 --> 10:55.654
            are gonna do just   
                fine, thank you.

10:55.689 --> 10:59.958
     What a wonderful           
civilization you'll build.      

10:59.993 --> 11:01.527
                 Amen.          

11:01.561 --> 11:02.728
                      Gee, Henri
                looks so sad.   

11:02.762 --> 11:04.263
             Oh, he's been      
        like this all day.      

11:04.297 --> 11:05.898
I've tried to snap him          
out of it,                      

11:05.932 --> 11:07.099
but nothing worked.             

11:07.133 --> 11:09.101
We even played that game        
he invented:                    

11:09.135 --> 11:10.936
"Shower Rescue."                

11:15.208 --> 11:17.142
It is no use.                   

11:17.177 --> 11:18.344
            Oh, Henri,          

11:18.378 --> 11:20.079
I wish there was some way       

11:20.113 --> 11:21.814
      we could fix things       
    so you could stay.          

11:21.848 --> 11:23.082
                          WOODY:
              Well, there's not.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.684
            It's too bad-- let's
            get going, Henri.   

11:25.719 --> 11:28.887
Well, there is one way,         
but it's...                     

11:28.922 --> 11:30.389
it's too much to ask.           

11:30.423 --> 11:31.423
                    Oh, come on,
                 Henri, tell me.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.491
Oh, no, no, no, no.             

11:32.525 --> 11:34.326
It would require                
some individual                 

11:34.361 --> 11:36.695
to make a great                 
sacrifice.                      

11:36.730 --> 11:37.930
     Well, we'd better get      
        to the airport.         

11:37.964 --> 11:38.964
    You only got six hours.     

11:41.101 --> 11:42.234
        Stop it, Woody.         

11:42.268 --> 11:43.669
        Henri is trying         
     to tell me something.      

11:43.703 --> 11:44.937
Hey, you know                   
what they say,                  

11:44.971 --> 11:47.339
"first luggage on,              
first luggage off."             

11:48.441 --> 11:49.942
It was nothing.                 

11:49.976 --> 11:51.977
Uh, just a crazy idea           

11:52.012 --> 11:54.213
that I could find some          
American citizen                

11:54.247 --> 11:56.148
to marry me                     
and thereby allow me            

11:56.182 --> 11:58.250
to remain                       
in your beautiful country.      

11:58.284 --> 12:00.619
    What a foolish dreamer      
            I am.               

12:00.653 --> 12:02.688
Okay, we better get Henri       
to the airport.                 

12:02.722 --> 12:04.490
Let's bring                     
the car around.                 

12:09.863 --> 12:12.231
       <i>Un, deux, trois...</i>       

12:12.265 --> 12:15.300
Henri, I just had               
a great idea!                   

12:15.335 --> 12:16.368
                  Really?       

12:16.403 --> 12:17.469
      You could marry me!       

12:17.504 --> 12:19.505
                      Oh!       

12:27.847 --> 12:29.381
                  Kelly, how can
                    you do this?

12:29.416 --> 12:30.883
                     How can you
                    marry Henri?

12:30.917 --> 12:34.353
Woody, it's just a little trick 
 so he can stay in the country. 

12:34.387 --> 12:36.188
          It's nothing          
            serious.            
Exactly.                        

12:36.222 --> 12:38.524
    We'll get married,          
      go on our honeymoon,      

12:38.558 --> 12:39.825
        come back               
    and get divorced.           

12:39.859 --> 12:41.326
          We're going           
        on a honeymoon?!        

12:41.361 --> 12:43.662
    Oh, goody!                  

12:43.697 --> 12:45.597
                  Oh, yes,      
                we have to.     

12:45.632 --> 12:48.567
     The immigration people     
    are very thorough.          

12:48.601 --> 12:50.569
    Sometimes they even bug     
      the honeymoon suite       

12:50.603 --> 12:52.137
to see if you are faking.       

12:52.172 --> 12:55.774
         Only you will          
         not be faking.         

12:55.809 --> 12:57.843
                      Kelly, I'm
                    telling you,

12:57.877 --> 12:59.378
I don't like this idea.         

12:59.412 --> 13:00.612
                         Really?

13:00.647 --> 13:01.947
No, not one bit.                

13:01.981 --> 13:04.950
             Sorry, Henri, but I
         guess I can't marry you

13:04.984 --> 13:08.087
            because my boyfriend
                won't let me.   

13:08.121 --> 13:09.221
        Very well.              

13:09.255 --> 13:10.656
    I... I understand.          

13:10.690 --> 13:12.858
Woody loves you very, very much.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.793
So much that                    
he is willing                   

13:14.828 --> 13:16.428
to snatch away                  
my one chance                   

13:16.463 --> 13:18.530
to remain                       
in my adopted homeland.         

13:20.033 --> 13:22.534
    ¶ Oh, beautiful ¶           

13:24.004 --> 13:27.239
(voice breaking):               
¶ For spacious skies... ¶       

13:28.308 --> 13:30.642
They really <i>are</i> spacious,       
        you know!               

13:32.379 --> 13:34.079
                         Look at
                     him, Woody.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.981
                Please let me   
                      marry him!

13:36.016 --> 13:37.850
                         Please,
                 please, please!

13:37.884 --> 13:39.151
    Forget it.                  

13:39.185 --> 13:40.552
                          Kelly,

13:40.587 --> 13:43.922
I-I love you, and I don't want  
to see you with another man.    

13:43.957 --> 13:46.658
I-I forbid you                  
to marry Henri.                 

13:46.693 --> 13:48.794
        Well, Mr. Woody Boyd,   

13:48.828 --> 13:52.064
                    the mask has
             certainly come off.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.034
                    If you're so
            small-minded that   

13:55.068 --> 13:58.170
             my marrying another
            man makes you take a
        rude tone of voice...   

13:59.806 --> 14:01.473
            ...maybe you're <i>not</i> 
         the man I want to marry

14:01.508 --> 14:03.709
right after                     
I marry this man.               

14:03.743 --> 14:05.377
Come on, Henri,                 
we're leaving.                  

14:05.412 --> 14:06.845
                          WOODY:
                          Kelly,

14:06.880 --> 14:09.248
     if you open that door,     
     that's it, it's over.      

14:10.850 --> 14:12.151
                      All right,
                          Kelly,

14:12.185 --> 14:14.720
              if you go up those
    steps, it is really over.   

14:18.024 --> 14:20.225
Kelly, if you keep walking      
    down Beacon Street          

14:20.260 --> 14:23.328
    and take the left           
     on Charles, it's over!     

14:23.363 --> 14:25.998
        (loud groaning)         

14:26.032 --> 14:28.000
            What the hell       
                 was that?      

14:28.034 --> 14:31.737
You've never heard              
your husband groan?             

14:31.771 --> 14:33.706
Oh, what a shock!               

14:37.377 --> 14:39.511
                I'm sure Frasier
                is benefiting   

14:39.546 --> 14:41.714
              from an especially
            thorough massage.   

14:41.748 --> 14:44.249
                        FRASIER:
                 Oh! Oh. <i>Oh! Oh!</i>

14:47.087 --> 14:48.854
    Sam, could                  
    I ask you a favor?          

14:48.888 --> 14:50.155
Sure.                           

14:50.190 --> 14:53.125
        Would you discreetly pop
      your head into your office

14:53.159 --> 14:56.061
          and casually determine
     what's taking them so long?

14:56.096 --> 14:57.396
I would do it myself,           

14:57.430 --> 14:59.398
but Frasier always says         
I'm so smothering.              

14:59.432 --> 15:01.266
                        Yeah. No
                 problem, honey.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.668
                 (clears throat)

15:05.338 --> 15:07.272
                  Relax, Lilith.
              Everything's fine.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.241
          Norm, Cliff,          
          get in here.          

15:18.385 --> 15:20.486
            I wonder            
    what that was all about.    

15:20.520 --> 15:21.653
        Uh, Paul?               

15:29.796 --> 15:31.063
                        I got 50
                      bucks says

15:31.097 --> 15:33.465
            he passes out before
                she gets to 100.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.167
Oh. I got, uh, ten              
that'll cover that.             

15:35.201 --> 15:36.468
                        NORM:   
                      All right.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.337
I'm in.                         
LILITH:                         
Excuse me.                      

15:38.371 --> 15:40.706
That's my husband               
you're wagering over.           

15:40.740 --> 15:42.675
      Put me down for 20.       

15:47.847 --> 15:49.748
So, what'll                     
you have, Kelly?                

15:49.783 --> 15:51.016
                    Oh, nothing.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.718
                I'm just here   
              waiting for Woody.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.820
                I really have to
            make up with him.   

15:54.854 --> 15:56.388
        I just feel like        

15:56.423 --> 15:59.191
     my whole life has come     
 crashing down around my ears.  

15:59.225 --> 16:01.694
            Uh-huh.             
 There's a five dollar minimum. 

16:07.867 --> 16:09.501
             Kelly.             

16:09.536 --> 16:11.003
      Woody, I'm so sorry.      

16:11.037 --> 16:13.272
  Well, I'm sorry, too, Kelly.  

16:13.306 --> 16:15.441
            We should have never
        had that terrible fight.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.509
                      It was all
                    my fault.   

16:17.544 --> 16:19.078
Well, at least                  
we're back together.            

16:19.112 --> 16:21.046
Now let's never fight again,    

16:21.081 --> 16:23.015
even if we have                 
genuine disagreements.          

16:23.049 --> 16:25.784
                        Woody, I
                     don't think

16:25.819 --> 16:27.152
                  you and I will
                ever disagree   

16:27.187 --> 16:29.221
              on anything again.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.856
        Well, I've got to go.   

16:30.890 --> 16:32.291
Where are you going?            

16:32.325 --> 16:33.625
To City Hall                    

16:33.660 --> 16:35.728
to marry Henri,                 
Mr. Forgetful.                  

16:35.762 --> 16:38.330
I'll call you                   
after the wedding.              

16:38.365 --> 16:40.299
        Love you.               

16:44.104 --> 16:45.904
        You okay?               

16:45.939 --> 16:47.639
Sam, have you ever loved a woman

16:47.674 --> 16:49.975
    who was on her way          
     to marry someone else?     

16:50.010 --> 16:52.578
            Well, once in the   
                 back of a limo,

16:52.612 --> 16:54.713
                     but I'm not
                    proud of it.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.515
What am I supposed to do?       

16:56.549 --> 16:59.885
     Aren't you tired of letting
     that guy walk all over you?

16:59.919 --> 17:01.787
    Well, yeah, but...          
                     Well, then,

17:01.821 --> 17:03.088
                     go stop the
                wedding, man.   

17:03.123 --> 17:04.890
            Give her that speech
         you've been practicing.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.791
You're right, Sam.              

17:06.893 --> 17:08.327
Out of my way, everybody.       

17:08.361 --> 17:10.863
      I'm going to bust up      
        a wedding.              
                All right, Wood.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.598
         And ask Kelly          
      to marry me instead.      

17:12.632 --> 17:14.133
      (whooping, applause       
        & chatter)              
                 There you go...

17:14.166 --> 17:15.467
        Give me a boost, Sam.   

17:15.502 --> 17:17.069
Yeah, all right,                
there you go.                   

17:17.103 --> 17:18.637
WOODY:                          
Okay.                           

17:18.672 --> 17:20.472
                Just a little   
                    higher, Sam.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.674
                Okay, I got 'em.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.875
                    Let me down.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.410
Okay. Here we go.               

17:24.444 --> 17:26.944
            Let me down, Sam.   

17:26.980 --> 17:28.247
    I did.                      

17:28.281 --> 17:29.615
What-What are you doing, man?   

17:29.649 --> 17:30.849
You holding on there?           

17:30.884 --> 17:32.184
            No, I must be stuck.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.519
        Well...                 

17:33.553 --> 17:35.120
don't panic here.               
We-We'll get you down.          

17:35.155 --> 17:37.222
        (yelling)               

17:37.257 --> 17:38.991
All right.                      
Uh, let me...                   

17:39.025 --> 17:40.926
let me climb up there           
and see what's going on.        

17:40.960 --> 17:42.494
                    No, no, Sam,
                there's no time!

17:42.529 --> 17:43.829
                     Go break up
                that wedding!   

17:43.863 --> 17:45.230
Go-Go ahead!                    

17:45.265 --> 17:46.398
        Uh, Carla?              
                        Yeah?   

17:46.433 --> 17:48.367
Just help him                   
out there, will you?            

17:52.806 --> 17:54.039
             WOODY:             
              Aah!              

17:54.074 --> 17:56.108
            Oh! Ow!             

17:56.142 --> 17:58.844
          I'm telling you, Paul,
        you got to get out here!

18:05.251 --> 18:07.353
    And so, by the authority    
         vested in me,          

18:07.387 --> 18:09.088
      by the Commonwealth       
      of Massachusetts...       

18:09.122 --> 18:10.122
SAM:                            
Wait, wait,                     
wait, wait!                     

18:10.156 --> 18:11.690
                    I here...   
          Stop, stop!           

18:11.725 --> 18:13.258
Hey, they don't love each other.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.426
     This wedding's a sham!     

18:16.062 --> 18:17.529
        Oh, I-I'm sorry.        

18:17.564 --> 18:19.164
    It's the wrong wedding.     

18:19.199 --> 18:21.800
    No, it's the                
    right wedding.              

18:21.835 --> 18:24.136
    I don't                     
    love you.                   

18:24.170 --> 18:25.404
                I never have,   

18:25.438 --> 18:26.405
and I never will.               

18:32.679 --> 18:34.913
        Anyhoo...               

18:34.948 --> 18:38.317
And so, Kelly and Henri,        
by the authority                

18:38.351 --> 18:39.651
vested in me by the             

18:39.686 --> 18:41.620
Commonwealth of Massachusetts,  
I now pronounce you...          

18:41.654 --> 18:44.089
Whoa! All right, all right,     
all right, hey, whoa.           

18:44.124 --> 18:45.724
                Sam, what are   
                 you doing here?

18:45.759 --> 18:48.494
I-I... Well, I'm here,          
because there's a certain guy   

18:48.528 --> 18:50.162
who loves you                   
very much, honey,               

18:50.196 --> 18:52.097
a lot more                      
than Henri ever could,          

18:52.132 --> 18:54.833
and someone I think             
that you have overlooked.       

18:54.868 --> 18:56.368
                Well, sure, Sam,

18:56.403 --> 18:59.538
        there's always been a   
    spark between you and me.   

19:04.044 --> 19:06.011
It's understandable, honey.     

19:06.046 --> 19:07.646
Just pre-wedding jitters.       

19:07.681 --> 19:09.715
It happens                      
to everybody.                   

19:09.749 --> 19:11.684
         Now, you ready         
        to go on?               

19:11.718 --> 19:13.585
                     I think so.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.587
        Very well, then.        

19:15.622 --> 19:18.390
    Friends, we are gathered    
        here today              

19:18.425 --> 19:19.692
                        to...   
    Stop this wedding!          

19:19.859 --> 19:21.026
She doesn't love him!           

19:21.061 --> 19:22.361
It's a disgrace!                

19:22.395 --> 19:24.697
         Aw, now, come on!      

19:26.332 --> 19:27.566
He's right.                     

19:27.600 --> 19:28.901
They're all right.              

19:28.935 --> 19:30.469
Let's face it--                 
it won't work,                  

19:30.503 --> 19:32.037
and the whole                   
world knows it!                 

19:32.072 --> 19:34.006
            (crying)            

19:36.476 --> 19:38.444
        Sorry.                  

19:39.913 --> 19:41.914
      So, you see, Kelly,       
          when I said           

19:41.948 --> 19:43.916
        that someone was        
    in love with you,           

19:43.950 --> 19:45.851
 see, I wasn't referring to me. 

19:45.885 --> 19:47.786
Woody is the person             
I'm talking about.              

19:47.821 --> 19:49.988
You see, he's the guy           
who loves you.                  

19:50.023 --> 19:52.324
                Oh, I get it.   

19:52.359 --> 19:54.626
        Yeah.                   

19:54.661 --> 19:56.061
        I love him, too, Sam.   

19:56.096 --> 19:57.329
Oh, there you go.               

19:57.364 --> 19:59.231
                    Thanks, Sam.

19:59.265 --> 20:00.933
                    Well, Henri,

20:00.967 --> 20:02.901
you ready                       
to marry me?                    

20:04.337 --> 20:08.240
Friends, we are gathered here   
today to join this man...       

20:08.274 --> 20:10.776
    Would the bride and groom   
            please turn around?!

20:10.810 --> 20:13.479
                 All right, stop
                this wedding!   

20:13.513 --> 20:14.480
            Woody!              

20:14.514 --> 20:16.715
             Kelly, you can't go
              through with this.

20:16.750 --> 20:18.417
                 I can't let you
                    marry Henri.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.953
Woody, we've been through this  
a million times.                

20:20.987 --> 20:22.988
It's just so Henri              
won't get deported.             

20:24.491 --> 20:26.125
        Oops!                   

20:26.159 --> 20:27.626
            You're wrong, Kelly.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.927
                 He's using you.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.362
                He-He wrote that
                 letter himself.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.997
                  He's not going
                 to be deported.

20:32.032 --> 20:34.600
          He-He's just trying to
         steal you away from me.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.669
                     How did you
                figure that out?

20:36.736 --> 20:37.670
      You mean, I'm right?      

20:39.272 --> 20:41.473
         Wow! Score one         
 for the Indiana school system. 

20:42.642 --> 20:44.343
HENRI:                          
I am sorry, Kelly.              

20:44.411 --> 20:46.945
          I was trying          
  to take you away from Woody   

20:46.980 --> 20:50.082
    and have my way with you    
    and divorce you and take    

20:50.116 --> 20:51.383
half your money.                

20:51.484 --> 20:54.353
    Can you ever forgive me?    

20:54.421 --> 20:57.723
  Oh, I can't stay mad at you,  
        you silly.              

21:00.427 --> 21:01.493
    Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.     

21:01.528 --> 21:03.195
                Wait a second   
            here, wait a second.

21:03.229 --> 21:05.164
             You telling me this
            whole thing was just

21:05.198 --> 21:07.366
              so you could steal
                 somebody's girl
                  away from him?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.701
        Yes.                    

21:08.735 --> 21:09.935
                 Oh, man, that's
                      beautiful.

21:09.969 --> 21:13.072
            That's beautiful.   
                  Ah, oh, that's
                     great, man.

21:13.106 --> 21:14.707
                      Let me ask
                you something   
                 here, you know.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.809
    When you're in the middle   
        of a trick like this,   

21:16.843 --> 21:18.444
            now is there just   
                 one part of you

21:18.478 --> 21:20.312
            that-that feels a   
              little bit guilty?

21:20.347 --> 21:21.714
                        Oh!     

21:21.748 --> 21:22.881
        (both laughing)         

21:22.916 --> 21:24.383
                    I thought   
                you'd like that.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.385
                You know, I have
            to tell you, man,   

21:26.419 --> 21:27.886
                 it's nice to be
                 around somebody

21:27.921 --> 21:29.888
                who finally gets
             this kind of stuff.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.191
I hope you're not upset         
with me, Woody.                 

21:32.225 --> 21:34.126
                Heck, no, Kelly.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.629
        In fact, I got something
        I want to say to you.   

21:42.335 --> 21:44.303
      How do you pronounce this?

21:44.337 --> 21:46.171
            Oh, darn that Carla.

21:46.206 --> 21:49.241
        All right, well, I'll   
        just have to wing it.   

21:49.275 --> 21:51.310
                Kelly,          

21:51.344 --> 21:53.312
                uh...           

21:55.548 --> 21:58.751
            We've been going out
         for a lot of years now,

21:58.785 --> 22:01.487
                 and I love you,
            and you love me, and

22:01.521 --> 22:04.089
             I want to spend the
    rest of my life with you.   

22:04.124 --> 22:07.526
                 What I'm trying
                    to say is...

22:07.560 --> 22:09.428
              will you marry me?

22:09.496 --> 22:12.498
Of course I'll marry you, Woody.

22:12.532 --> 22:15.634
     Oh, Kelly, you've made this
    the happiest day of my life!

22:15.669 --> 22:17.569
        Mine, too.              

22:17.604 --> 22:20.072
I know I forgave Henri          
and everything,                 

22:20.106 --> 22:22.174
but I'm still                   
a little miffed at him.         

22:22.208 --> 22:24.810
I can't believe anybody would   
pull such a dirty trick         

22:24.844 --> 22:26.345
just to get a girl.             

22:26.379 --> 22:28.781
MAN:                            
So two complete                 
strangers break in              

22:28.815 --> 22:30.649
and tell us not                 
to get married!                 

22:30.684 --> 22:32.618
Why should we care?             

22:32.652 --> 22:35.287
    Honey, c-could we           
      at least go steady?       

22:35.321 --> 22:37.289
                         MAN #2:
                     It happened
                    to you, too?

22:37.323 --> 22:38.957
                         MAN #3:
                    Yeah, twice.

22:38.992 --> 22:41.360
We've got to get locks          
for those doors.                

22:42.562 --> 22:44.897
        Uh, so you see,         
  our visas have just expired,  

22:44.931 --> 22:48.000
     and, uh, we are going      
        to be deported.         

22:48.034 --> 22:48.967
 <i>Oui.</i>
