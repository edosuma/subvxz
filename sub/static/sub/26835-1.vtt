00:38.928 --> 00:42.039
- I am absolutely a
fanatic over this game.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.279
I can eat it up, it's awesome.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.519
- I love it.

00:45.520 --> 00:47.149
I love getting to
be something else

00:47.150 --> 00:48.759
and creating this character.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.912
- It's a fun way to
express yourself.

00:57.580 --> 00:59.899
- I've been talking pretty
much nonstop for the past

00:59.900 --> 01:01.629
96 hours.

01:01.630 --> 01:03.499
This is as important
as music and movies.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.550
It's another way to
talk and communicate.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.739
- It's a wonderful way of
connecting with a lot of

01:08.740 --> 01:09.690
different people.

01:09.691 --> 01:11.049
It really changes a lot for you.

01:11.050 --> 01:13.689
It puts you into a different
world and it's just wow,

01:13.690 --> 01:14.690
this is lovely.

01:23.840 --> 01:28.659
- When you engage
something so deep,

01:28.660 --> 01:31.710
so dark, so personal

01:33.240 --> 01:37.320
in that intimate kind of a
way, you carry that with you

01:38.730 --> 01:40.578
wherever you are.

01:49.770 --> 01:53.619
- Here, you are an
outsider getting to play

01:53.620 --> 01:54.850
the ultimate outsider.

01:59.043 --> 02:00.969
All the sudden, you
have different people

02:00.970 --> 02:03.479
that place different
values on what is gaming?

02:03.480 --> 02:06.240
What is a role playing game?

02:08.241 --> 02:09.977
- It was something that
opened people's eyes

02:09.978 --> 02:14.150
to being able to express yourself
in a whole different way.

02:19.220 --> 02:21.689
- This is one of the great
secrets of pop culture,

02:21.690 --> 02:23.020
of the 21st century.

02:45.330 --> 02:48.219
- The key moment
of my entire life

02:48.220 --> 02:51.499
is when I first played
Dungeons and Dragons.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.339
- Your dungeon master
has placed you

02:53.340 --> 02:55.189
in a dreadfully
precarious position.

02:55.190 --> 02:57.764
You're playing the most
phenomenal game ever created.

02:57.765 --> 02:59.069
Your choices are limited.

02:59.070 --> 03:00.779
Stand and fight or run.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.740
Use your lightning bolt.

03:04.972 --> 03:08.110
- I was just instantly
just addicted.

03:11.063 --> 03:13.379
- Throughout the 70's and
80's, the most commercially

03:13.380 --> 03:15.889
successful role playing games
were all fantasy games.

03:15.890 --> 03:18.929
They were all sort of
variations on Lord of the Rings

03:18.930 --> 03:19.940
for the most part.

03:22.130 --> 03:23.599
You go on an adventure.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.490
You kill a dragon.

03:24.491 --> 03:27.059
You get some gold and
then you hit repeat.

03:27.060 --> 03:29.979
Dungeons & Dragons
popularizing it.

03:29.980 --> 03:32.849
- Dungeons & Dragons has
grown from an obscure hobby

03:32.850 --> 03:35.189
for an obsessed
elite into a craze

03:35.190 --> 03:37.420
shared by an obsessed
million or more.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.459
- Role player, through
it, was something

03:40.460 --> 03:42.879
that was really big in
contemporary culture.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.510
Literally millions of people
were playing all the time.

03:49.260 --> 03:51.709
It allowed something quite new,

03:51.710 --> 03:54.914
which was a game that had
a very strong narrative.

03:54.915 --> 03:58.929
People would be getting
into this so much.

04:00.300 --> 04:03.729
- It's surprising how
much of your aggressions

04:03.730 --> 04:05.931
you can take out just by
rolling dice trying to

04:05.932 --> 04:08.130
kill some monster.

04:10.490 --> 04:13.489
- Role playing games were an
opportunity to live the story,

04:13.490 --> 04:15.769
ya know, be an actor,
tell the story,

04:15.770 --> 04:18.529
but create drama.

04:18.529 --> 04:22.051
- Yeah, I think the
role playing is,

04:22.052 --> 04:23.559
we call it an art
form, role playing,

04:23.560 --> 04:25.749
and it's just unique.

04:25.750 --> 04:27.434
It's a unique experience.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.769
- I found Dungeons & Dragons
at a very early age,

04:34.770 --> 04:37.028
as a teenager, and we
had a group that played

04:37.029 --> 04:39.240
and it wasn't something
we talked about.

04:40.920 --> 04:44.009
To admit to being a
Dungeons & Dragons player

04:44.010 --> 04:47.470
or role player, you
risked social ridicule.

04:53.966 --> 04:55.889
- Role-playing games
were not understood.

04:55.890 --> 04:59.089
It was new and especially
in the deep south.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.502
You're a geek and a
nerd for doing it.

05:01.503 --> 05:04.711
None of the cool kids
played role-playing games.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.159
- I think that that is
where I found more of a

05:16.160 --> 05:19.380
comfort level interacting
with people.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.369
- I was the outsider.

05:24.370 --> 05:27.450
I was teased, not invited
to birthday parties.

05:29.090 --> 05:30.980
That was my life, ya know?

05:47.070 --> 05:49.879
- Part of the role-playing game
hobby and prior to everybody

05:49.880 --> 05:52.279
sitting down to play,
somebody's gotta come up with a

05:52.280 --> 05:55.310
general story line of what
you're gonna play through.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.141
- Well, we appreciate that.

05:58.142 --> 05:59.120
- Alright.

05:59.121 --> 06:00.259
- Thanks for calling me, okay?

06:00.260 --> 06:03.369
- You can buy books
that give you stories

06:03.370 --> 06:05.132
or you can write your own.

06:09.420 --> 06:12.830
So, from a early point, we
were creating our own story.

06:15.730 --> 06:18.409
- Stewart Wieck, White
Wolf's founder,

06:18.410 --> 06:21.089
he and his brother started
a magazine that was

06:21.090 --> 06:22.339
called White Wolf magazine.

06:22.340 --> 06:26.039
The first couple issues looked
like their stapled together,

06:26.040 --> 06:28.419
black and white paper,
white line art,

06:28.420 --> 06:31.649
looked like something that
you'd see at a high school

06:31.650 --> 06:34.729
freshman make out of his
garage because that's kinda

06:34.730 --> 06:36.540
not too far from the truth.

06:37.600 --> 06:41.359
- We pooled money ourselves
and we bought a box of

06:41.360 --> 06:46.059
photocopy paper and I took
that into high school one day

06:46.060 --> 06:48.469
and asked for permission
to use the photo copier

06:48.470 --> 06:51.369
in the front office and
they said, "Sure, Stewart."

06:51.370 --> 06:56.370
So, I printed my demonic
role-playing game magazine

06:56.950 --> 07:00.420
on the rural Georgia high
school photo copier.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.179
Initially, the sales on the
magazine were nothing.

07:10.180 --> 07:13.149
I mean, we made like 100
copies of the first issue

07:13.150 --> 07:14.120
of White Wolf.

07:14.121 --> 07:16.519
We're not succeeding
because this looks like

07:16.520 --> 07:18.121
a piece of garbage.

07:24.430 --> 07:25.989
There was a decision
point to like, okay,

07:25.990 --> 07:27.769
if this is really going to
be something we're going

07:27.770 --> 07:31.349
to continue to do, we've
gotta be more serious

07:31.350 --> 07:32.369
about it again.

07:32.370 --> 07:34.739
That's the point at which
we borrowed some money

07:34.740 --> 07:37.741
from our parents.

07:39.430 --> 07:42.406
- That allowed us to do
the full color cover

07:42.407 --> 07:43.457
and all this content.

07:55.890 --> 07:59.839
But, the way we really got
traction with the magazine

07:59.840 --> 08:02.479
was that we would go
every year to Gen Con.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.969
Okay, we need, where's upstairs?

08:04.970 --> 08:06.320
Does anybody have any idea?

08:10.980 --> 08:14.819
- Gen Con is the oldest
tabletop role-playing

08:14.820 --> 08:16.789
game convention in the world.

08:16.790 --> 08:20.759
It's where if you make
a physical product

08:20.760 --> 08:24.619
that rolls dice or uses
cards or has a board,

08:24.620 --> 08:27.330
that's where you go to
celebrate your hobby.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.789
Back then, magazines were
the only way you got

08:32.789 --> 08:33.789
your information.

08:34.950 --> 08:38.849
- So, we would drive up all
these copies of the magazine

08:38.850 --> 08:40.279
and we would hand
out free copies,

08:40.280 --> 08:42.480
just giving them out to
every gamer in line.

08:48.010 --> 08:49.779
- Gen Con was a place
where you always saw

08:49.780 --> 08:52.871
the next big game, the next
big breakout to happen.

08:56.330 --> 08:58.579
- It would've been Gen
Con '87 that I first met

08:58.580 --> 09:01.211
Mark Rein-Hagen of Lion
Rampant at the time

09:01.212 --> 09:05.359
and Ars Magica was one
of those little games

09:05.360 --> 09:08.977
from a little company
that I found and I was

09:08.978 --> 09:10.880
blown away by it.

09:16.160 --> 09:19.230
It was very artful, the
contents were spectacular.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.196
- Ars Magica was
this phenomenal game

09:24.197 --> 09:27.089
that won all these awards.

09:27.090 --> 09:29.110
At the time, we
were not doing well

09:30.090 --> 09:32.429
and I met Stewart and he
just seemed like the kind of

09:32.430 --> 09:34.700
rock solid business guy.

09:39.263 --> 09:40.929
- These are serious
fantasy game players

09:40.930 --> 09:44.269
who are here to assume the
roles of imaginary characters

09:44.270 --> 09:46.509
in imaginary places.

09:46.510 --> 09:48.641
- The role-playing game industry
at that point was tiny.

09:48.642 --> 09:53.642
So, for financial reasons,
Lion Rampant and White Wolf

09:54.790 --> 09:57.612
magazine decided to merge.

09:59.870 --> 10:02.519
Mark, at that point, decided
to move down to Atlanta

10:02.520 --> 10:04.020
where the Wieck brothers were.

10:09.490 --> 10:11.049
Thought was that we were
going to do everything

10:11.050 --> 10:13.481
we were doing
already, but better.

10:13.482 --> 10:16.129
- White Wolf moves from the
environments of a little

10:16.130 --> 10:18.829
five points, which is
this very Bohemian,

10:18.830 --> 10:22.555
artist friendly, counter
cultural cluster of

10:22.556 --> 10:26.049
the weird and alternative
and misunderstood

10:26.050 --> 10:27.850
that lives in the
middle of Atlanta.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.700
So, it's a perfect fit.

10:35.450 --> 10:38.429
- Everyone worked together
and they lived together.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.410
Your bedroom was your office.

10:39.411 --> 10:41.250
- Mark's bedroom was his office.

10:42.102 --> 10:44.939
- The house was always a weird
kind of eclectic mess of

10:44.940 --> 10:46.790
creative papers everywhere.

10:47.750 --> 10:51.650
- We're all stuck in this house
together and it was nuts.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.561
- So, here was this
little company with this

11:02.562 --> 11:07.079
really nifty, semi
successful independent game

11:07.080 --> 11:09.850
and it's time for the annual
pilgrimage to Gen Con.

11:13.830 --> 11:16.039
- You had to go through Indiana.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.840
You had to go through
Gary, Indiana.

11:19.670 --> 11:23.619
I had never seen a place, it
just looked like time forgot.

11:23.620 --> 11:26.788
It was the worst.

11:30.870 --> 11:33.939
- Their wholesale urban
decay brought about

11:33.940 --> 11:37.209
by the economic disaster that
was the 70's and the 80's

11:37.210 --> 11:39.159
ruined a lot of people's lives.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.369
That's what Mark saw in Gary.

11:40.370 --> 11:44.998
He saw the complete and
utter disdain for humanity.

11:48.660 --> 11:49.660
We did that.

11:50.641 --> 11:53.079
It wasn't the automotive
companies that destroyed.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.910
Rust Belt, America, it was us.

11:56.310 --> 11:57.310
People.

11:58.020 --> 11:59.020
We let it happen.

12:17.780 --> 12:20.660
- I remember us saying,
"This place is bad."

12:22.560 --> 12:24.600
"Who would live here?"

12:32.710 --> 12:34.756
Mark was like,
"Probably vampires."

12:40.600 --> 12:42.510
- Instantly, I knew, boom.

12:43.610 --> 12:45.610
You are the vampire.

12:50.760 --> 12:51.760
You were human.

12:52.660 --> 12:53.799
You've been fucked.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.349
Your life is over.

12:55.350 --> 12:56.959
It's this nightmare world.

12:56.960 --> 12:57.870
What are you gonna do now?

12:57.871 --> 12:59.210
How are you gonna survive?

13:22.587 --> 13:24.237
Everyone in the
car went, "What?"

13:28.730 --> 13:32.429
Like back then, the
idea of being a vampire

13:32.430 --> 13:35.640
was just impossible to imagine.

13:42.754 --> 13:44.329
- In role-playing games,

13:44.330 --> 13:47.729
vampires were monsters
to be killed.

13:47.730 --> 13:49.689
Their lairs looted for treasure.

13:49.690 --> 13:52.649
- Vampires were always something
in Dungeons and Dragons

13:52.650 --> 13:53.560
that you fought.

13:53.561 --> 13:57.169
- You know, now it seems
so normal and ordinary

13:57.170 --> 13:59.419
and such a plausible idea.

13:59.420 --> 14:03.971
But at the time, it was
a definite glitch.

14:13.010 --> 14:18.010
Normally, at Gen Con, which
is the great one convention,

14:18.430 --> 14:20.429
I was a party animal.

14:20.430 --> 14:22.830
I would party the
whole time, right?

14:25.560 --> 14:28.740
This convention, I
didn't party at all.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.850
I just sat and wrote
and wrote and wrote.

14:35.710 --> 14:37.490
And it just all flowed out.

15:06.222 --> 15:07.719
- Being in that dark
side takes me away

15:07.720 --> 15:11.010
from my ordinary life.

15:17.640 --> 15:22.640
You gotta explore the
deprivation and violence

15:24.420 --> 15:28.540
that you don't do in
your regular life.

15:33.910 --> 15:38.479
You don't have to actually
expose yourself to those dangers

15:38.480 --> 15:40.260
but you get to experience them.

15:43.370 --> 15:45.419
You can just get a bit
of an understanding

15:45.420 --> 15:48.303
why you feel the way you
feel or act the way you act

15:48.304 --> 15:50.700
by taking on a different role.

15:59.930 --> 16:03.039
I met a lot of people I've
been friends with for years

16:03.040 --> 16:04.040
through RP-ing.

16:06.250 --> 16:09.173
You get a thing that binds you
together, this experience.

16:27.383 --> 16:29.383
- Fuckin' daylight!

16:32.947 --> 16:35.309
- Vampire at the
Masquerade clearly draws

16:35.310 --> 16:37.899
a lot of it's inspiration
from movies like.

16:37.900 --> 16:40.680
The Lost Boys and New
Dark and The Hunger,

16:41.820 --> 16:44.489
sort of vampire
myths of the 80's.

16:44.490 --> 16:49.063
It also draws from some
of the entire spectrum of

16:49.064 --> 16:51.100
popular vampire mythology.

16:55.170 --> 16:58.226
- Vampires have been depicted
differently in different eras.

16:58.227 --> 17:01.449
In the very earliest
stories about vampires,

17:01.450 --> 17:03.189
folklore stories about vampires,

17:03.190 --> 17:05.469
vampires are not seductive
and they are not appealing.

17:05.470 --> 17:06.539
Vampires are ghouls.

17:06.540 --> 17:10.029
The Lord Ruthven is
somebody who is handsome,

17:10.030 --> 17:14.969
is personable, and yet,
ultimately, he is revealed to be

17:14.970 --> 17:18.118
a top of the food
chain predator.

17:18.119 --> 17:23.119
But Dracula really is ground
zero for our contemporary

17:23.270 --> 17:24.969
conception of the vampire.

17:24.970 --> 17:28.169
He is where it starts, the
idea of the seductive vampire,

17:28.170 --> 17:30.528
the appealing vampire,
the vampire who's

17:30.529 --> 17:35.329
lust for human blood does
not make him unwelcome

17:35.330 --> 17:36.670
in human company.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.710
Anne Rice's Interview
with a Vampire was a real

17:44.711 --> 17:45.749
turning point for a
number of reasons,

17:45.750 --> 17:49.649
but the single biggest
one I think was that it

17:49.650 --> 17:52.449
pushed the sexuality
of vampire stories

17:52.450 --> 17:53.930
even farther forward.

17:56.817 --> 17:59.789
- That provided the
contemporary idea of

17:59.790 --> 18:03.326
they were tragic, romantically
cursed creatures,

18:03.327 --> 18:07.840
ones you could sympathize with
and arguably wanna be with.

18:12.430 --> 18:14.529
- I decided I would
not read Anne Rice.

18:14.530 --> 18:16.229
I would not be tainted.

18:16.230 --> 18:19.129
Of course, what I didn't
realize was that all these

18:19.130 --> 18:21.414
80 vampire movies
that I loved so much,

18:21.415 --> 18:24.760
all stole their stuff
from Anne Rice.

18:30.470 --> 18:31.879
- Sleep all day,
party all night.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.490
It's fun to be a vampire.

18:38.556 --> 18:43.349
- What vampire did was it
essentially took ownership

18:43.350 --> 18:46.759
of every previous
vampire myth said,

18:46.760 --> 18:48.909
if you're a fan of
any of these things,

18:48.910 --> 18:51.860
come play in our world 'cause
our world is the whole world.

18:57.110 --> 18:59.509
- After we got back
from that Gen Con,

18:59.510 --> 19:01.660
Mark really started
working on his vampire.

19:03.140 --> 19:06.679
- Stewart was very much the
sounding board for me.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.569
His office is across
the hallway from me

19:09.570 --> 19:11.329
as I constantly burst in and go,

19:11.330 --> 19:13.138
"What do you think of this idea?

19:13.139 --> 19:18.069
"Okay, we're gonna have clans
and these clans will be

19:18.070 --> 19:20.169
"the way, they'll be
like character classes,

19:20.170 --> 19:22.439
"but we're not gonna
do character classes."

19:22.440 --> 19:25.199
"They'll be like social
groups but they won't"

19:25.200 --> 19:26.679
"give you anything extra."

19:26.680 --> 19:28.099
"They will, they will,
but they won't."

19:28.100 --> 19:32.619
He would go, "That
sounds good, Mark."

19:39.610 --> 19:42.159
- One of the most powerful
design ideas in Vampire

19:42.160 --> 19:43.910
is the idea of Clans.

19:45.120 --> 19:49.349
- Monster entertainment
always, I think, has appealed

19:49.350 --> 19:52.809
to outsiders but, if you are
slightly different in some

19:52.810 --> 19:56.149
manner in your real life,
it's so nice to belong,

19:56.150 --> 19:59.310
ya know, to a clan or a pack
and to have a clear purpose.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.789
- That idea that
you would inherit

20:03.790 --> 20:06.644
a world view and
political position

20:06.645 --> 20:10.579
and history with your choice
of character had never been

20:10.580 --> 20:13.130
expressed so fully and
completely before.

20:28.690 --> 20:30.499
- When I first started
in role-playing games,

20:30.500 --> 20:32.449
the biggest artists in the
gaming industry at the time

20:32.450 --> 20:35.009
were guys that did
the D&D stuff,

20:35.010 --> 20:37.100
but they weren't very dynamic.

20:38.100 --> 20:41.469
There was gaming art before
Tim and then there was Tim.

20:41.470 --> 20:43.469
- It was a lot of fun.

20:43.470 --> 20:47.179
So many things before that
were very high fantasy art

20:47.180 --> 20:49.499
to varying degrees of quality.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.719
Ya know, classic
swords and sorcery,

20:51.720 --> 20:55.369
big guys in armor and
dragons and women in

20:55.370 --> 20:56.850
chain mill bikinis.

20:58.230 --> 21:03.031
Vampire was the first
time where I really sunk,

21:03.032 --> 21:05.639
pardon the pun, I
sunk my teeth into it

21:05.640 --> 21:10.269
and it was the right
subject matter

21:10.270 --> 21:12.070
at the right time for me.

21:15.990 --> 21:17.909
I immediately knew
what I wanted to do.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.532
Instead of having this
character on this page that

21:20.533 --> 21:23.310
feels like a comic book,

21:24.220 --> 21:27.039
what if I wanna make them real?

21:27.040 --> 21:28.390
I wanna make them possible.

21:31.920 --> 21:35.439
- He basically brought
this real world grittiness

21:35.440 --> 21:37.919
that you could, you
could really believe

21:37.920 --> 21:39.370
'cause they were real people.

21:40.350 --> 21:41.629
- I would just get friends over.

21:41.630 --> 21:42.630
I would say,

21:43.303 --> 21:44.479
"Okay, who's gonna be right
for this character?"

21:44.480 --> 21:46.069
My friends were in these bands.

21:46.070 --> 21:47.917
That's my pal, Sherry Wall.

21:47.918 --> 21:50.029
She's one of my favorite
people on the planet.

21:50.030 --> 21:51.269
There's a classic right there.

21:51.270 --> 21:52.489
That's Tim Shinkle.

21:52.490 --> 21:54.939
My best friend, Joel, who
modeled for everything for me

21:54.940 --> 21:56.069
for a long time.

21:56.070 --> 21:57.777
It's my pal, Scotty Wilson.

21:57.778 --> 22:00.739
The absolute, quintessential,
gypsy white trash

22:00.740 --> 22:02.551
vampire is Scott Wilson.

22:02.552 --> 22:03.552
Wow.

22:09.976 --> 22:11.939
So, instead of having
it be some count

22:11.940 --> 22:15.189
that lives in, ya know,
Romania, 400 years ago,

22:15.190 --> 22:16.940
I started with a
different culture.

22:18.690 --> 22:22.379
- It immediately makes it like
wow, this is our vampires.

22:22.380 --> 22:23.809
I can be one.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.169
I can just go down to
the club and be one.

22:26.170 --> 22:30.389
- I don't know whether or
not I realized how big.

22:30.390 --> 22:35.129
Vampire was going to be until
these visuals came in.

22:35.130 --> 22:37.850
I was like, this is
cool on another level.

22:45.960 --> 22:49.889
- Tim Bradstreet's
artwork was one of the

22:49.890 --> 22:51.590
best decisions we made.

22:52.940 --> 22:56.149
- The full pages were it.

22:56.150 --> 22:57.240
They were gothic pun.

22:58.610 --> 23:00.939
They expressed the
moment of the time.

23:00.940 --> 23:02.640
They expressed characters.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.260
They were perfect.

23:07.690 --> 23:11.179
Funny thing is, we had no
money left for a cover.

23:11.180 --> 23:12.220
We were screwed.

23:13.700 --> 23:16.279
- They had actually commissioned
a piece of artwork,

23:16.280 --> 23:19.349
Vampire with a blood tear and
a helicopter crashed in the

23:19.350 --> 23:21.069
background and a
motorcycle and stuff

23:21.070 --> 23:23.755
and it was just, didn't
really feel right.

23:23.756 --> 23:27.309
I came up with the idea of
wanting to do something

23:27.310 --> 23:29.509
that was a little more
photographic and a little more,

23:29.510 --> 23:31.949
let people just put their own
vision of what they thought

23:31.950 --> 23:34.070
vampires could be onto that.

23:37.073 --> 23:38.040
- So we got in his car.

23:38.041 --> 23:41.229
We bought a bunch of roses
with the last dollars

23:41.230 --> 23:45.479
in my pocket and we
went to a stone place

23:45.480 --> 23:48.310
and we bought a piece
of green marble.

23:49.310 --> 23:52.119
We snapped that photo
and I am absolutely

23:52.120 --> 23:56.349
100% convinced that if
it had a stupid, cheesy

23:56.350 --> 24:01.350
gamer, I'm a Vampire, that
wouldn't have worked.

24:16.330 --> 24:20.059
- At that time, the world
was changing a lot.

24:20.060 --> 24:22.419
The sort of old guard
Republicans in America

24:22.420 --> 24:24.009
were coming up power.

24:24.010 --> 24:26.437
The Berlin Wall had
just come down.

24:26.438 --> 24:29.039
Music was making this
revolution, this sort of

24:29.040 --> 24:32.033
hair metal poppy scene of
the 80's was fading away

24:32.034 --> 24:34.680
to the Seattle punk scene.

24:35.970 --> 24:38.669
- In the early 90's, there
was an undercurrent

24:38.670 --> 24:40.580
of a need for change.

24:41.490 --> 24:44.969
There was a need for a dark
voice and those people

24:44.970 --> 24:47.630
with dark voices emerged.

24:55.832 --> 24:57.999
- 1990 was the first time
that you heard about it.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.789
It's first advertisement for
this game called Vampire

25:00.790 --> 25:03.859
was just a big black paper
with just white Vampire

25:03.860 --> 25:05.069
across it.

25:05.070 --> 25:07.349
- When Vampire the
Masquerade came out,

25:07.350 --> 25:08.599
I'd seen nothing like it.

25:08.600 --> 25:13.089
This beautiful green cover
with a red rose across it,

25:13.090 --> 25:15.630
just absolutely beautiful,
I had to pick it up.

25:21.980 --> 25:25.049
- This is vampires
and goth and punk

25:25.050 --> 25:27.639
and that, of course, makes
it vastly different

25:27.640 --> 25:30.290
from any role-playing game
that has ever come before.

25:33.720 --> 25:37.539
- Here, you are an
outsider getting to play

25:37.540 --> 25:38.850
the ultimate outsider.

25:41.717 --> 25:45.717
That was catalytic for us.

25:50.830 --> 25:53.069
- It wasn't even really so
much playing the vampire

25:53.070 --> 25:56.110
as becoming the vampire.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.803
- It's not just reading a
novel about an anti-hero.

26:03.804 --> 26:07.970
Those moral ambiguities and
moral challenges are yours now.

26:22.623 --> 26:25.706
- I can hear her heart beating.

26:29.427 --> 26:31.450
My mind screams with lust.

26:37.565 --> 26:38.565
Now.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.049
- Suddenly, people who had
never been interested

26:53.050 --> 26:57.169
in role-playing games before
or geek culture before

26:57.170 --> 26:58.170
were interested.

27:00.870 --> 27:03.429
- I remember working in the
store after the Vampire

27:03.430 --> 27:05.659
first edition had come out.

27:05.660 --> 27:08.239
There was sort of a
steady stream of ya know,

27:08.240 --> 27:09.949
these sort of goth kids
that were coming into

27:09.950 --> 27:11.749
the game store which was weird

27:11.750 --> 27:13.009
'cause they didn't
buy anything else.

27:13.010 --> 27:14.469
They didn't socialize
with anyone.

27:14.470 --> 27:16.709
They came in and they bought
their White Wolf products

27:16.710 --> 27:17.710
and they left.

27:22.540 --> 27:25.069
- They wanted to share
this thing with us,

27:25.070 --> 27:26.320
this thing that we loved.

27:27.700 --> 27:30.369
It was a new
sensation to be cool

27:30.370 --> 27:32.370
or to at least think
you were cool.

27:56.680 --> 28:01.269
- I grew up in a very
not progressive part

28:01.270 --> 28:04.659
of the United States and I
didn't really have a lot

28:04.660 --> 28:06.869
of friends, so all of
my spare time was spent

28:06.870 --> 28:09.629
reading books or drawing or
doing all of these things

28:09.630 --> 28:11.990
that were kind of by
myself and in my own head.

28:18.910 --> 28:20.699
Then, when I finally
met one or two people

28:20.700 --> 28:22.899
who actually played
these things,

28:22.900 --> 28:25.859
it was like a whole other
experience because suddenly,

28:25.860 --> 28:28.499
I was getting to hang
out and be with people

28:28.500 --> 28:30.339
that were just as into these

28:30.340 --> 28:32.330
strange little ideas as I was.

28:36.470 --> 28:39.759
Looking at those books, looking
at every single little bit

28:39.760 --> 28:42.089
of that stark black and
white, beautiful art

28:42.090 --> 28:44.629
with all the detail,
all that ink work,

28:44.630 --> 28:45.780
I was enthralled.

28:47.650 --> 28:52.429
It was just so, my
imagination went everywhere

28:52.430 --> 28:54.530
just getting to look
at all of that stuff.

29:00.890 --> 29:03.929
It's not just here is a
mechanical system of numbers,

29:03.930 --> 29:06.906
but rather, it's like, here
is a way you can really

29:06.907 --> 29:10.520
collaboratively create some
universe with each other.

29:20.540 --> 29:23.729
- Vampire had the artwork
and the clownsiest stem

29:23.730 --> 29:25.169
of this idea that
you're the monster

29:25.170 --> 29:28.009
but what really made
it revolutionary is

29:28.010 --> 29:31.329
that it shifted focus
away from rolls and dice

29:31.330 --> 29:32.640
towards storytelling.

29:34.670 --> 29:38.259
- Vampire was written differently
than other role-playing

29:38.260 --> 29:39.093
game products.

29:39.094 --> 29:40.339
It was produced differently.

29:40.340 --> 29:41.639
It looked different.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.329
It read differently.

29:43.330 --> 29:46.799
It was not just a collection
of numbers and statistics

29:46.800 --> 29:49.231
and tables for how to
kill monsters or how to

29:49.232 --> 29:51.040
have a car chase.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.979
- When it came out,
it was a revolution.

29:57.980 --> 30:02.099
This was during a time when
games like roll master

30:02.100 --> 30:04.689
were great and they had
these hundreds and hundreds

30:04.690 --> 30:07.640
of pages of tables that they'd
go through and look through.

30:09.090 --> 30:13.969
We started realizing that what
we felt was most powerful

30:13.970 --> 30:15.639
was the conversation.

30:15.640 --> 30:18.859
It wasn't really, can I
jump between the buildings,

30:18.860 --> 30:21.860
roll the dice and so, that became
more and more meaningless.

30:25.670 --> 30:29.589
- Horror fiction is really
popular because it allows

30:29.590 --> 30:32.729
us to engage with a lot
of big moral questions

30:32.730 --> 30:37.169
and these issues about humanity
and often about belonging.

30:37.170 --> 30:40.159
Role-playing is a very
good medium for exploring

30:40.160 --> 30:41.960
some of those dynamics
specifically.

30:44.300 --> 30:47.089
- It's not an external
force you're fighting

30:47.090 --> 30:50.439
which you can kill with
a sword or a fireball.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.370
It's the conflict within you

30:53.810 --> 30:57.760
which makes it much more
psychological type of game.

31:00.330 --> 31:02.339
- It doesn't look very exciting.

31:02.340 --> 31:04.259
If you walk into a room
and people are playing

31:04.260 --> 31:07.399
pen and paper, they're
just sitting around.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.749
It's happening in this sort
of shared imaginative space

31:09.750 --> 31:12.249
between all the players
and that means that

31:12.250 --> 31:14.780
you can't see it
unless you're playing.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.580
It's all happening
in their minds.

31:58.660 --> 32:00.429
- There's Mark
Rein-Hagen's head.

32:00.430 --> 32:01.430
Come show me.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.719
Turn, look down.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.400
Show me the whole business.

32:11.360 --> 32:14.759
- At Gen Con, game
just explodes.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.119
- Clone of Chaos.

32:16.120 --> 32:17.619
- I went over to the White
Wolf booth and I was like,

32:17.620 --> 32:19.199
"Dude, how's it going
for you guys?"

32:19.200 --> 32:20.989
They were like, "It's nuts."

32:20.990 --> 32:22.190
It was crazy.

32:24.570 --> 32:26.899
White Wolf grew so fast.

32:26.900 --> 32:29.819
I mean, they literally went
from being a garage company

32:29.820 --> 32:32.070
to a million dollar
company overnight.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.790
- People's appetite for the
game was just ferocious.

32:39.850 --> 32:42.379
- Going from living
in a house together

32:42.380 --> 32:45.509
with our warehouse in
the yard to ya know,

32:45.510 --> 32:47.880
renting a warehouse building.

32:50.140 --> 32:53.099
- Vampire was taking
the industry by storm

32:53.100 --> 32:55.929
and we became known as
the company that would

32:55.930 --> 32:57.130
throw the crazy parties.

33:14.340 --> 33:17.609
- The late night, gothic
punk scene in Atlanta

33:17.610 --> 33:19.939
was incredibly strong.

33:19.940 --> 33:21.329
- We went out every night.

33:21.330 --> 33:23.029
We were there in the clubs
where this is happening.

33:23.030 --> 33:25.499
So, it's informing the game
and you could not separate

33:25.500 --> 33:28.800
the game from club culture
and club fashion.

33:29.700 --> 33:33.359
- It began to aggregate different
looks of counter culture

33:33.360 --> 33:38.360
into one beautiful, blended,
gothic punk aesthetic,

33:38.940 --> 33:42.769
which then, in turn,
certainly began to appear

33:42.770 --> 33:45.319
everywhere else.

33:45.320 --> 33:47.859
- Stuff that was really
niche, all of the sudden

33:47.860 --> 33:51.479
became this sort of bigger
and broader subculture

33:51.480 --> 33:52.830
visual aesthetic.

34:04.260 --> 34:08.260
Thousands of people,
inarguably, by those classic

34:09.141 --> 34:11.909
vampire depictions
of you can be this.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.069
- We have vampires,
we need werewolves.

34:26.070 --> 34:28.998
Right and so, we're gonna
put ourselves on the spot.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.149
Here's the games
we're going to make

34:31.150 --> 34:33.284
and I guess we'll make them.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.150
- Now we gotta make them.

34:41.710 --> 34:44.279
- We were really creating
a world of darkness

34:44.280 --> 34:46.918
and the idea was that in
the world of darkness,

34:46.920 --> 34:49.069
these vampires
existed side by side

34:49.070 --> 34:51.159
with these werewolves
and these mages

34:51.159 --> 34:54.053
and the lingering after
effects of ghosts.

35:01.570 --> 35:04.059
There were other games
that kind of supposed

35:04.060 --> 35:06.449
different supernatural
creatures would be in contact

35:06.450 --> 35:09.299
with one another, but the
world of darkness idea

35:09.300 --> 35:12.319
that these all shared a
world, that their societal

35:12.320 --> 35:15.349
structures overlapped one
another or often intruded

35:15.350 --> 35:18.649
on one another, that's
really I think,

35:18.650 --> 35:22.710
what made the world of
darkness stand out.

35:36.040 --> 35:39.339
The same time, these live
action rules for playing.

35:39.340 --> 35:42.029
Vampire the Masquerade emerged.

35:45.700 --> 35:49.009
- The first live action
role-playing game product

35:49.010 --> 35:50.099
was called The Masquerade.

35:50.100 --> 35:51.869
It was a big box set.

35:51.870 --> 35:54.559
There'd never really been
a LARP product before.

35:54.560 --> 35:56.489
Once you actually had
something on the shelf

35:56.490 --> 35:59.909
for people to buy, next
to the table top game,

35:59.910 --> 36:01.301
then it exploded.

36:01.302 --> 36:02.760
Then it got big.

36:09.150 --> 36:10.459
- LARP started out
as an acronym for

36:10.460 --> 36:12.339
live action role playing.

36:12.340 --> 36:14.969
It's a form of role playing
where you embody the character

36:14.970 --> 36:17.269
and very often, you also
dress up as your character

36:17.270 --> 36:20.760
and try to portray their
actions as fully as possible.

36:24.330 --> 36:25.869
- LARP existed before this.

36:25.870 --> 36:27.832
This is what made it huge
in the same way that

36:27.833 --> 36:30.729
there was science fiction
before Star Wars

36:30.730 --> 36:32.180
and then there was Star Wars.

36:34.200 --> 36:35.959
All of the sudden, instead
of like five or six people

36:35.960 --> 36:39.909
playing around a table,
you had 15, 30, 60,

36:39.910 --> 36:43.559
hundreds playing in
parks, college campuses,

36:43.560 --> 36:44.560
in night clubs.

36:46.696 --> 36:47.996
It was more like an event.

36:52.170 --> 36:55.736
- Up until Vampire, most
of the live action games

36:55.737 --> 36:59.209
were people in a
field or in a forest

36:59.210 --> 37:02.049
with padded foam swords
running and chasing

37:02.050 --> 37:03.508
and hitting each other.

37:05.260 --> 37:08.550
The Vampire live action game
was more of a social drama.

37:13.580 --> 37:15.139
All of the sudden, you
had different people

37:15.140 --> 37:17.639
that place different
values on what is gaming?

37:17.640 --> 37:19.769
What is a role playing game?

37:19.770 --> 37:24.770
- We are all being hunted
because we are one!

37:34.280 --> 37:36.869
- It completely changed
the type of people

37:36.870 --> 37:39.815
that would play an
event like that.

37:39.816 --> 37:40.816
- Calm down!

37:43.110 --> 37:45.099
- They were not
traditional gamers.

37:45.100 --> 37:46.429
They were theater people.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.379
They cared about the
narrative, the story,

37:48.380 --> 37:50.437
the drama, they
wanted intensity.

37:55.222 --> 37:57.179
- What people get
surprised by often

37:57.180 --> 38:00.725
is how powerful role
playing as a form is.

38:00.726 --> 38:03.477
- You made me this monster!

38:03.478 --> 38:06.929
- Everybody's creating
the story every moment

38:06.930 --> 38:08.049
through the game.

38:08.050 --> 38:10.337
When you speak, you
are creating it.

38:10.338 --> 38:12.779
When you are not speaking,
you are also creating it.

38:12.780 --> 38:15.769
You're doing something
kind of difficult

38:15.770 --> 38:16.969
and awesome together.

38:16.970 --> 38:18.949
You created this world

38:18.950 --> 38:21.000
and you made it real
for a little while.

38:29.620 --> 38:32.159
- I felt the timing was perfect
for this role playing game.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.659
So, I went to friends of
mine, said what do you guys

38:34.660 --> 38:37.839
think about transforming
the world of Vampire

38:37.840 --> 38:40.420
into a living, breathing
organization?

38:41.410 --> 38:43.750
Our interest was
building a community.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.019
- Camarilla Fan Club was
extraordinarily important.

38:48.020 --> 38:50.369
White Wolf was one of the
very first role playing game

38:50.370 --> 38:53.859
companies to have a
dedicated fan club

38:53.860 --> 38:56.329
that would go out into the
world and show people

38:56.330 --> 38:58.100
how cool their stuff was.

38:59.090 --> 39:01.099
- That was something that was
really different with Vampire.

39:01.100 --> 39:04.559
We didn't build large communities
around our D&D games,

39:04.560 --> 39:06.949
but when it became
Vampire and then,

39:06.950 --> 39:09.589
when it became live action,
then all the sudden,

39:09.590 --> 39:11.718
we were bringing other
people from other cities in.

39:11.719 --> 39:15.439
- We felt a really easy
point of entry for someone

39:15.440 --> 39:17.409
to get involved in the
world of darkness

39:17.410 --> 39:19.724
where friends would say,
"Hey, what about this"

39:19.725 --> 39:20.558
"game in the back?"

39:20.559 --> 39:21.789
"Come with us, take a look
and see what you think."

39:21.790 --> 39:23.569
- Those people were passionate
about what they were doing

39:23.570 --> 39:26.469
and so, they continued to
inspire other people to be

39:26.470 --> 39:29.150
passionate and it was a big
part of how the brand grew.

39:32.130 --> 39:34.939
- It grew so fast, we simply
could not keep up with it.

39:34.940 --> 39:39.010
It was impossible to keep up
with how fast it was growing.

39:42.110 --> 39:44.510
- Not only across cities,
but across continents.

39:47.360 --> 39:50.960
- Camarilla Fan Club
organized LARPS regularly.

39:51.830 --> 39:54.260
In Europe, it reached
millions of people.

40:04.170 --> 40:06.249
- Vampire became
more than a game.

40:06.250 --> 40:10.349
It became a culture, a
culture that opened doors to

40:10.350 --> 40:13.798
different kinds of people
with different ideas,

40:13.799 --> 40:16.470
but we were all joined
by this common interest.

40:20.290 --> 40:22.699
- What I loved about
the Vampire culture

40:22.700 --> 40:25.459
was it didn't matter
what gender you were.

40:25.460 --> 40:27.769
It didn't matter
what color you were.

40:27.770 --> 40:31.419
It didn't matter what ethnic
background or cultural

40:31.420 --> 40:32.619
background you came from.

40:32.620 --> 40:33.820
They were all a vampire.

40:35.879 --> 40:38.979
- I remember reading many
Dungeons and Dragons books

40:38.980 --> 40:41.340
and I'd see a black person.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.730
World of Darkness was different.

40:48.510 --> 40:50.953
- What I find really cool
about Vampire the Masquerade

40:50.954 --> 40:53.559
is that it created that
foundation of equality.

40:53.560 --> 40:56.209
- I had the community finally

40:56.210 --> 40:59.419
that accepted me for what
I am and allowed me to be

40:59.420 --> 41:00.510
what I wanna be.

41:08.190 --> 41:11.639
- I have always
been outta place.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.659
I never really fit in.

41:13.660 --> 41:16.929
I was a gamer, Dungeons &
Dragons and stuff like that

41:16.930 --> 41:21.930
and a friend of mine got me
into Vampire back in '93.

41:24.600 --> 41:29.119
About two years after that,
we start getting to LARP,

41:29.120 --> 41:31.469
which was recently
released at that time

41:31.470 --> 41:36.029
and we became the first
Camarilla based Vampire group

41:36.030 --> 41:37.030
in San Diego.

41:40.760 --> 41:44.579
A lot of my close friends who
I'm still friends with now,

41:44.580 --> 41:46.290
we started off in
a Vampire LARP.

41:49.300 --> 41:52.560
I like dressing up
like a monster.

41:53.530 --> 41:56.389
It gives me more of
this sort of feel,

41:56.390 --> 41:59.799
ya know, not like many
people and I can be myself

41:59.800 --> 42:01.390
'cause this is basically me.

42:10.360 --> 42:14.788
I realized that my
friends were more family

42:14.789 --> 42:17.410
than anybody else.

42:18.290 --> 42:19.590
I'm much happier that way.

42:24.483 --> 42:27.510
- Here it is, the
White Wolf bus.

42:28.850 --> 42:31.170
Woo, now they wanna
film this road.

42:32.540 --> 42:34.449
Oh, that's scary.

42:34.450 --> 42:37.049
- Frankly, anywhere we went,
there was a very different

42:37.050 --> 42:40.115
kind of fan that was around
the White Wolf booth

42:40.116 --> 42:43.746
holding our games than
you saw anywhere else

42:43.747 --> 42:45.790
in the convention hall.

42:47.373 --> 42:50.039
- You know, when you're
at a RPG convention,

42:50.040 --> 42:52.329
you're talking about Magic
and you're talking about

42:52.330 --> 42:54.579
ya know, knights
hitting each other

42:54.580 --> 42:57.430
and none of that is what the
World of Darkness was about.

43:02.680 --> 43:05.340
- Going into a gaming
environment was a boy's club.

43:07.440 --> 43:10.516
Vampire the Masquerade
wasn't a boy's club.

43:12.640 --> 43:16.339
- I have people to this day
come up to me and say,

43:16.340 --> 43:19.559
"Man, I remember that Gen
Con after you came out"

43:19.560 --> 43:23.520
"with Vampire, suddenly, there
were women at Gen Con!"

43:26.840 --> 43:30.419
- It became inviting to
girls because here were

43:30.420 --> 43:33.410
suddenly games that were
about stories and characters

43:33.411 --> 43:35.540
and relationships.

43:37.730 --> 43:40.569
- They would come to the
convention and go to no one else's

43:40.570 --> 43:42.390
booth except our booth.

43:44.140 --> 43:47.179
- Having almost a 50% ratio
of women was unheard of

43:47.180 --> 43:48.590
in the role playing scene.

43:53.840 --> 43:55.969
- It was big business
at this point.

43:55.970 --> 43:57.720
It was a serious
competitor to D&D.

43:58.870 --> 44:01.479
They had a goofy
cartoon in the 80's.

44:01.480 --> 44:06.099
All of the sudden, we've got
like prime time FOX show

44:06.100 --> 44:08.240
that's just coming out
after the X-Files.

44:13.290 --> 44:15.149
- I got a call, this
guy, and he said,

44:15.150 --> 44:17.509
"I'm so and so from the
Creative Artist Agency."

44:17.510 --> 44:20.690
"We're the agency that does
everything in Hollywood."

44:21.996 --> 44:24.029
I invite Mark into
the office and say,

44:24.030 --> 44:25.529
"Hey Mark, what do
you, this message,"

44:25.530 --> 44:27.179
"what do you think we
should do with this?"

44:27.180 --> 44:29.859
He just goes running screaming
through the office.

44:29.860 --> 44:32.571
"CAA called, they
called, they called!"

44:35.650 --> 44:40.638
- This is what the Prolog Clan
will do to all you Gangles!

44:43.430 --> 44:44.634
- The thing about
it was that it was

44:44.635 --> 44:47.228
an Aaron Spelling show.

44:47.229 --> 44:49.360
Strike number one.

44:51.948 --> 44:53.898
- You Gangles are
cruising for broo-ha.

44:55.840 --> 44:57.399
You chose the wrong place.

44:57.400 --> 44:59.359
- So, Mark moved out
there on the west coast

44:59.360 --> 45:02.219
and they were putting together
the film deal with Spelling.

45:02.220 --> 45:05.349
- Everywhere I could, I'd
try to manipulate it to be

45:05.350 --> 45:09.170
a better show than
Spelling wanted to be.

45:10.875 --> 45:11.875
- Alexandra!

45:13.406 --> 45:16.399
- He got his sticky
old hands all over it

45:16.400 --> 45:18.170
and just made it slop.

45:19.514 --> 45:20.649
- Alexandra!

45:20.650 --> 45:22.909
- It was still Vampire
the Masquerade,

45:22.910 --> 45:24.689
ya know, Crescent
City, the whole game,

45:24.690 --> 45:25.969
but I was really turned
off by the show.

45:25.970 --> 45:28.283
I couldn't even watch
all the episodes.

45:39.920 --> 45:42.489
- At that time, one of
the big controversies

45:42.490 --> 45:45.850
that came up for White Wolf
was a guy named Rod Ferrell.

45:47.774 --> 45:50.649
- You cut yourself,
let them drink it.

45:50.650 --> 45:53.219
It runs through their
veins for a few moments.

45:53.220 --> 45:54.980
Then, your blood
becomes tainted.

45:56.560 --> 46:00.009
- He murdered people in a
sort of cult-like fashion.

46:00.010 --> 46:02.369
- Prosecutors plan to
seek the death penalty

46:02.370 --> 46:03.920
against Rod Ferrell.

46:05.050 --> 46:07.306
- We were like,
"Oh, we're fucked."

46:16.230 --> 46:18.469
- The fact is, it was a
whole vampire culture.

46:18.470 --> 46:21.995
People who wanted to dress
like vampires, drink blood

46:21.996 --> 46:24.457
and generally behave
like vampires.

46:24.458 --> 46:27.770
Clearly, that caused a
lot of consternation.

46:29.370 --> 46:31.389
- Had church leaders
speaking out against us,

46:31.390 --> 46:33.490
political figures
speaking out against us.

46:34.370 --> 46:37.099
- Was so absurd, the
accusations from the media

46:37.100 --> 46:40.137
and from the state
was so ridiculous.

46:51.910 --> 46:54.296
- Horror has always
been a problem for

46:54.297 --> 46:57.199
religious groups
because clearly,

46:57.200 --> 47:01.159
all of the horror creatures exist
outside of God's universe.

47:01.160 --> 47:02.599
They're not God's creatures.

47:02.600 --> 47:03.999
God didn't make werewolves.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.319
God didn't make vampires
and it was clearly a thing

47:07.320 --> 47:09.620
that people found
very disturbing.

47:10.950 --> 47:13.419
- For the murder of
Richard Wendell, you are

47:13.420 --> 47:14.910
hereby sentenced to death.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.400
- We had nothing to do with him.

47:18.401 --> 47:20.550
He didn't even, by all
accounts, play our games.

47:23.850 --> 47:26.049
That point, there was a
number of internal struggles

47:26.050 --> 47:28.359
between the development
team in Atlanta

47:28.360 --> 47:30.690
that was making the
games and Mark.

47:33.180 --> 47:36.289
- Mark had moved to California
to open White Wolf West

47:36.290 --> 47:39.209
and he was frequently in
conflict with some of the more

47:39.210 --> 47:43.529
traditional business-minded
people at the office

47:43.530 --> 47:47.119
and there were also
people who felt like

47:47.120 --> 47:49.789
that west coast office
was just bleeding money

47:49.790 --> 47:51.640
and they weren't
generating anything.

47:52.750 --> 47:55.529
- One memory I have is that
I had just gotten back from

47:55.530 --> 47:58.469
Germany and this amazing trip

47:58.470 --> 48:02.769
and I just ran three LARPs and
I come back to White Wolf

48:02.770 --> 48:04.969
straight from the airport,
no one has any idea

48:04.970 --> 48:08.369
how exhausted I am or
how little I slept

48:08.370 --> 48:12.049
and I come in the warehouse
and the entire company,

48:12.050 --> 48:14.259
they all give me this look.

48:14.260 --> 48:16.310
Like, "You fuckin' asshole."

48:19.402 --> 48:22.469
- The late 90's, the
entire table top industry

48:22.470 --> 48:24.370
was going through a
fundamental shift.

48:26.302 --> 48:29.589
The entire publishing trade
was being massively disrupted

48:29.590 --> 48:31.060
by digital entertainment.

48:32.270 --> 48:35.619
- The same problems the book
industry led to our main

48:35.620 --> 48:39.101
competitor, TSR, who ran Dungeons
& Dragons going bankrupt

48:39.102 --> 48:42.029
and it nearly bankrupted us.

48:42.030 --> 48:46.069
We had layoffs, which
it was a hard time

48:46.070 --> 48:49.369
and so, in the middle
of this atmosphere of

48:49.370 --> 48:54.369
hardship for the company,
the west coast office

48:54.370 --> 48:57.740
became a more difficult
thing to keep going.

49:00.780 --> 49:02.729
- I just thought that
you wouldn't wanna

49:02.730 --> 49:04.709
get rid of the creator.

49:04.710 --> 49:06.949
But ya know, what
I didn't realize,

49:06.950 --> 49:09.880
the entire company would wanna
get rid of the creator.

49:13.280 --> 49:15.229
Made me feel like shit.

49:15.230 --> 49:16.299
I mean, I hate that.

49:16.300 --> 49:18.729
As much as I'm
always the outsider,

49:18.730 --> 49:23.120
as much as I'm always the
guy who is not loved,

49:24.240 --> 49:26.500
ya know, it destroyed me.

49:42.526 --> 49:45.719
- In 1998, White Wolf
Publishing as a company

49:45.720 --> 49:49.749
was struggling, which is ironic
because at the same time,

49:49.750 --> 49:52.689
Vampire media and
entertainment was booming.

49:52.690 --> 49:55.869
You had Buffy, you had
From Dusk Til Dawn.

49:55.870 --> 49:58.489
And a lot of what you
saw in those shows

49:58.490 --> 50:00.990
were influenced directly
by the World of Darkness.

50:04.010 --> 50:08.179
- One of the great untold stories
about early 21st century

50:08.180 --> 50:11.249
popular culture is really
how much World of Darkness

50:11.250 --> 50:13.700
influenced the resurgence
of vampire culture.

50:15.322 --> 50:16.900
- You better wake up.

50:17.816 --> 50:20.430
The world you live in is
just a sugar coated type.

50:21.851 --> 50:24.329
There is another
world beneath it.

50:24.330 --> 50:26.119
- Blade came out in 1998.

50:26.120 --> 50:27.920
That was basically
based on Vampire.

50:31.130 --> 50:36.130
- Blade definitely was Vampire
the Masquerade on steroids.

50:36.303 --> 50:37.500
- Blade.

50:38.973 --> 50:41.919
- I thought the trailers
looked so fuckin' awesome,

50:41.920 --> 50:42.969
ya know?

50:42.970 --> 50:44.849
I was excited to see the movie.

50:44.850 --> 50:45.820
- That's him!

50:45.820 --> 50:46.653
Get him, fuck him up!

50:46.654 --> 50:49.149
- It didn't occur to me until
I was watching the movie

50:49.150 --> 50:51.198
and I'm like, "Oh, wow!"

50:54.351 --> 50:56.979
That looks like a thing
that I did, ya know?

50:56.980 --> 50:59.869
It was just where he stops
at the end of that scene

50:59.870 --> 51:03.385
where he shh, then
there's Blade.

51:05.278 --> 51:07.010
It was almost the
exact same pose.

51:10.120 --> 51:12.149
A couple years later, I
talked to the writer

51:12.150 --> 51:13.479
of the first movie.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.079
He's sitting next
to me and he says,

51:15.080 --> 51:17.689
"Ya know, on Blade one, dude,"

51:17.690 --> 51:19.829
"we totally had your art books."

51:19.830 --> 51:21.329
I'm like, "You're kidding!"

51:21.330 --> 51:22.330
Really?

51:23.311 --> 51:26.029
He goes, "Yeah, yeah,
we had your portfolio",

51:26.030 --> 51:27.129
"your vampire portfolio."

51:27.130 --> 51:28.317
"We had your art book."

51:28.318 --> 51:32.669
I was like, "So, you
just borrowed my stuff"

51:32.670 --> 51:34.129
"and you didn't
hire me for that."

51:34.130 --> 51:35.270
He's like, "Oh."

51:38.940 --> 51:41.199
I mean, Blade was a character
before Vampire, of course,

51:41.200 --> 51:43.839
but when did Blade start
to look really badass

51:43.840 --> 51:46.239
and take the safari jacket off

51:46.240 --> 51:47.340
and the green goggles?

51:48.690 --> 51:49.690
I rest my case.

51:51.810 --> 51:53.639
A little while later,
I get a phone call

51:53.640 --> 51:54.980
from Guillermo Del Toro.

51:56.560 --> 51:57.979
I was like, "You're
Guillermo, aren't you?"

51:57.980 --> 51:59.539
He's like, "Yeah."

51:59.540 --> 52:02.029
He goes, "Listen, we're gonna
work together right now."

52:02.030 --> 52:03.369
I was like, "Right now,
what do you mean?"

52:03.370 --> 52:06.020
He goes, "I've got a
film, it's Blade 2."

52:06.970 --> 52:08.319
I was like, "Oh, really?"

52:08.320 --> 52:11.084
He goes, "I'm gonna make sure
you get paid this time."

52:11.085 --> 52:12.085
Ha!

52:29.570 --> 52:32.089
- I would say after
that, it, I think,

52:32.090 --> 52:33.480
became very problematic

52:34.740 --> 52:38.309
because after that, White
Wolf, in a very real sense,

52:38.310 --> 52:40.710
in a very legal sense went
to war with the club.

52:46.990 --> 52:51.229
- White Wolf, the sort of
rock and roll cultural mavens

52:51.230 --> 52:54.159
of the last decade now became
the guys that had lawyers

52:54.160 --> 52:57.670
and suits in a lawsuit
with their fans.

52:59.110 --> 53:03.350
- When the lawsuit happened,
the community was shattered.

53:06.010 --> 53:08.959
- Even though White
Wolf won that lawsuit,

53:08.960 --> 53:11.330
they really lost the
court of public opinion.

53:12.560 --> 53:15.300
That was the end of the
Camarilla as we knew it.

53:16.270 --> 53:17.920
Some people were
very hurt by it.

53:21.670 --> 53:25.109
- The response to that is
you started to see sales

53:25.110 --> 53:27.110
just drop and sort of go away.

53:28.310 --> 53:30.449
- I saw the sales had gone down.

53:30.450 --> 53:32.989
I have friends who run
these game stores.

53:32.990 --> 53:36.139
I said, "I'm not selling
Vampire as much any more."

53:36.140 --> 53:41.140
- We were used to selling tens
of thousands of something

53:41.250 --> 53:43.190
and now, we're
selling thousands.

53:45.840 --> 53:49.119
- We knew that we made a game
that was popular in the 90s.

53:49.120 --> 53:52.309
We also knew that role
playing games, overall,

53:52.310 --> 53:55.769
were declining, but what we
didn't know at the time was,

53:55.770 --> 53:57.755
was it us or was it them?

53:57.756 --> 54:01.969
Was it a product problem or
was it a market problem?

54:01.970 --> 54:03.879
- At this point, we
had hundreds of books

54:03.880 --> 54:05.699
around Vampire the
Masquerade and we felt like

54:05.700 --> 54:08.769
we had explored so many
of the topics that were

54:08.770 --> 54:10.649
there to explore that we
were starting to move into

54:10.650 --> 54:14.489
minutia that only applied
to a small group of people.

54:14.490 --> 54:18.749
- There was so much vampire
stuff that we had created,

54:18.750 --> 54:23.489
this world was so
rich, so developed,

54:23.490 --> 54:27.389
like new players were
just too intimidated by

54:27.390 --> 54:29.010
I have to know what.

54:32.610 --> 54:36.229
We decided we needed to
restart and I think then,

54:36.230 --> 54:40.089
we decided the best way to do
that was to sort of fulfill

54:40.090 --> 54:42.669
this inherent promise
that we'd made

54:42.670 --> 54:43.870
from the very beginning.

54:44.810 --> 54:48.599
For a 1991 ya know,
the advertising is,

54:48.600 --> 54:49.800
Gehenna is coming.

54:56.648 --> 54:58.410
- Gehenna is coming soon.

55:00.090 --> 55:03.609
- From 1991 on, we had said
in our books at some point,

55:03.610 --> 55:07.259
the elder vampires will wake
up and they will be hungry

55:07.260 --> 55:11.349
and it will fundamentally
change the very existence

55:11.350 --> 55:14.325
and the nature of what it
means to be a vampire.

55:14.326 --> 55:17.161
- The world will turn cold

55:17.162 --> 55:19.799
and unclean things will
rise up from the earth

55:19.800 --> 55:23.305
and storms will roll,
lightning will light fires,

55:23.306 --> 55:27.240
boils will fester and their
bodies, twisting, will fall.

55:29.190 --> 55:32.180
- It was the vampire apocalypse,
we called it, Gehenna.

55:33.927 --> 55:36.594
- The you will know, it is time.

55:38.363 --> 55:40.863
Gehenna will soon be upon you.

55:45.100 --> 55:47.119
- People in the
industry were like,

55:47.120 --> 55:49.869
"Whoa you guys, that's radical."

55:49.870 --> 55:51.849
You're insane. - Insane.

55:51.850 --> 55:55.739
- You're taking one of
those popular products

55:55.740 --> 55:59.065
in the marketplace and you're
just gonna stop doing it?

56:23.290 --> 56:25.469
- When I started playing
World of Darkness,

56:25.470 --> 56:28.399
my mom had gotten very sick

56:28.400 --> 56:33.351
and I ya know, had a lot
of feelings about that

56:33.352 --> 56:36.792
that I didn't really
talk to people about.

56:36.793 --> 56:41.793
So, getting to play a character
that maybe acted out

56:42.190 --> 56:45.789
or do stuff was a really
great way of taking

56:45.790 --> 56:50.790
all of that emotional stuff and
putting it into something.

56:56.640 --> 57:01.069
The first time I went,
go into the room,

57:01.070 --> 57:04.659
have a basic costume,
nothing really super cool

57:04.660 --> 57:07.529
and I walk in and I
see all these people

57:07.530 --> 57:10.009
and they're engaged
and doing stuff.

57:10.010 --> 57:11.189
I chickened out.

57:11.190 --> 57:12.940
I turn around and I
walk right back out.

57:14.794 --> 57:17.840
I didn't say anything
for like 30 minutes.

57:19.230 --> 57:21.389
Then, people started
talking to me and I was

57:21.390 --> 57:23.259
responding in character,
then all of a sudden,

57:23.260 --> 57:24.340
I was just doing it.

57:25.850 --> 57:27.450
I felt exhilaration.

57:28.490 --> 57:31.399
It was awesome, it
was very thrilling.

57:31.400 --> 57:32.760
It was scary too.

57:34.430 --> 57:35.869
It's intense and it requires

57:35.870 --> 57:37.640
a lot of social skills actually.

57:39.820 --> 57:43.889
I learned so much about
what I can do as a person,

57:43.890 --> 57:46.109
being able to play all
these different roles

57:46.110 --> 57:48.430
and I learned a lot
about other people too.

57:50.620 --> 57:53.859
The World of Darkness
and the LARP community

57:53.860 --> 57:55.240
is very close knit.

57:57.350 --> 57:59.779
For me, what is cool
is involving people,

57:59.780 --> 58:02.520
telling really great
stories and making it fun.

58:08.410 --> 58:10.680
- The war itself had
become more perilous.

58:13.510 --> 58:14.780
The weapons had evolved.

58:15.720 --> 58:18.429
- With all the upheaval that
was going on at the time,

58:18.430 --> 58:20.909
the last thing that
White Wolf needed was

58:20.910 --> 58:22.909
yet another legal battle.

58:22.910 --> 58:23.860
- Who are you people?

58:23.861 --> 58:24.899
- You're in the middle
of a war that's been

58:24.900 --> 58:26.939
raging for the better
part of 1,000 years,

58:26.940 --> 58:29.964
a blood feud between
vampires and lichens.

58:29.965 --> 58:31.959
Werewolves.

58:31.960 --> 58:33.809
- When I saw
Underworld, I thought,

58:33.810 --> 58:35.669
"They must have
contacted White Wolf"

58:35.670 --> 58:37.689
"and done this movie in
association with them."

58:37.690 --> 58:39.339
"I thought it was that close."

58:39.340 --> 58:41.975
- They essentially make a
World of Darkness movie

58:41.976 --> 58:43.709
just straight up.

58:43.710 --> 58:46.999
- The chain has never
been broken, not once,

58:47.000 --> 58:49.389
not in 14 centuries,

58:49.390 --> 58:53.869
not since we elders first began
to leap frog through time.

58:53.870 --> 58:57.439
- There's cases where we
felt movies or other works

58:57.440 --> 58:59.280
had taken too much
of our material

59:00.400 --> 59:03.329
and Underworld was a
good example of that.

59:03.330 --> 59:04.330
- Ah yes,

59:05.945 --> 59:07.049
the lichen.

59:07.050 --> 59:09.919
- Underworld is a washed
down version of Masquerade.

59:09.920 --> 59:11.899
The whole vampire
verse werewolf thing

59:11.900 --> 59:14.137
came from the World of Darkness.

59:19.510 --> 59:21.829
- We had a protracted
legal fight but,

59:21.830 --> 59:25.127
we reached a satisfactory
settlement on it

59:25.128 --> 59:27.009
and the settlement
allowed them to

59:27.010 --> 59:28.826
continue making the movies.

59:28.827 --> 59:31.349
- That was the only time
that we were acknowledged.

59:31.350 --> 59:33.660
The rest of the time,
we were just copied.

59:34.620 --> 59:38.779
- 2006 to 2008, you saw
that the Twilight novels,

59:38.780 --> 59:41.208
the Sookie Stackhouse,
Charlaine Harris books,

59:41.209 --> 59:45.900
those were very clearly
influenced by World of Darkness.

59:45.901 --> 59:49.370
♪ When you came in,
the air went out ♪

59:49.371 --> 59:52.369
- I think the greatest copy
of Vampire the Masquerade

59:52.370 --> 59:53.370
was True Blood.

59:55.210 --> 59:57.359
- Anybody that saw True
Blood first season

59:57.360 --> 59:58.639
thought that same thing.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.619
They knew about Vampire.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:03.249
They went, "Is this the
new Vampire show?"

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:04.749
"Is this a new White Wolf show?"

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:06.719
- The first vampire was Cain.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.519
Being a vampire is
the mark of Cain.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.729
It's God's punishment
for bringing...

01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:13.689
- The True Blood TV series,
they actually talk about Cain.

01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:15.969
The first vampire, I
mean, that was sort of

01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:18.259
a defining point of our myth.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.349
- Your majesty, you've had
me abducted by werewolves.

01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:23.269
- They had kings of
different cities.

01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:24.669
We had princes.

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:26.456
They had sheriffs,
we had sheriffs.

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:28.899
- Listen, Bill was
in fact kidnapped

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:31.029
by human or vampire.

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:32.989
I am duty bound as
sheriff of the area

01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:34.590
in which he resides to find him.

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:38.509
- It had gotten to a point where
there weren't even really

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:41.865
pretending not to copy
our stuff any more.

01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:51.429
- In 2004, we relaunched
the World of Darkness

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:54.459
in what a lot of players call
the new World of Darkness.

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:55.889
It wasn't Vampire
the Masquerade.

01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:57.819
It was Vampire the Requiem.

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:01.414
- There was a lot of excitement
looking forward to it,

01:01:01.415 --> 01:01:02.489
to it coming.

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:06.829
- I was excited to see a
reinvention of this world

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.400
that I'd grown to love.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.879
When I received the book, I
started paging through it

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.560
and did not speak to me at all.

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:25.300
- Requiem emphasized lust
story and more rules

01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:26.780
and procedure.

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:31.989
- Vampire became
more gaming oriented

01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:35.640
and rules monitoring than role
playing and storytelling.

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:38.419
- That was a big departure
for a lot of people.

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:40.649
Tim Bradstreet wasn't
doing the art.

01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:43.150
The art was very
comic book style.

01:01:44.417 --> 01:01:46.959
- If you look at
Requiem more closely

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.139
and if you look at the
nuts and bolt of it,

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.590
there is this huge change.

01:01:52.074 --> 01:01:54.710
It can be played to win.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.449
- When Vampire Requiem
had come out,

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:01.976
all of the people that I
was playing the LARP with

01:02:01.977 --> 01:02:03.477
were like, "What?"

01:02:05.877 --> 01:02:08.729
- To me, Requiem was
another role playing game

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:12.859
and I love role playing games,
but it didn't speak to me

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:14.210
like Masquerade did.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.239
- We sold more books
with that launch

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.789
than we had ever sold
before on any other launch.

01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:31.790
100,000 units, which for 2004

01:02:31.972 --> 01:02:33.960
in the role playing
game industry,

01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:36.349
might as well have
parted the Red Sea.

01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:37.870
It was an incredible launch.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:44.199
- While they sold a
lot of the core book,

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.509
what was very telling is
they didn't sell much

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:49.050
of it's companion books.

01:02:49.051 --> 01:02:51.960
- White Wolf with a new game,

01:02:51.961 --> 01:02:53.859
who wasn't going
to buy that book?

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.699
Everyone was going
to buy that book,

01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:57.330
but after that first book,

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:03.629
I saw people were not as
interested and I thought,

01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:07.110
"Oh my goodness, maybe White
Wolf just committed suicide."

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.349
- What do you do in a
situation like this?

01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:13.509
You have fans who love the
traditional World of Darkness

01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:15.949
but they're not buying
the game any more.

01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:18.339
You tend to launch a
brand new version of it

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:19.824
and no one's buying it.

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:37.670
- Know any games we can play?

01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:43.299
- One of the reasons that
we weren't resonating

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:46.829
with the youth of the role
playing game industry

01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:49.469
is because the youth
weren't in this market.

01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:50.970
They had found another market.

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:57.999
- Book publishing was dying.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.129
It was clear everything
was moving electronic

01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:03.439
and we were trying to
basically create a property

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.242
that would be exciting again.

01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:12.099
- Bloodlines truly captured
the sense of story

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.987
from the role playing game
and the live action game.

01:04:14.988 --> 01:04:19.179
It was a new way to play
something that we were already

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.580
enthusiastic about.

01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:25.659
- Bloodlines is a game that
was put out by Activision

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:27.769
and we were all excited
about the potential.

01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:31.659
So, we felt like we
needed to get into being

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.493
our own development studio.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:37.080
- That's when CCP steps
into the picture.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.059
- The idea of EVE was that
we would create a world

01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:48.249
with rules and that the
players inside that world

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:50.440
would then create the game.

01:04:51.385 --> 01:04:53.709
- Don't tell me what
you're looting.

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:55.299
I don't wanna know until after.

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:57.540
- The game is about people
interacting with other people.

01:04:58.251 --> 01:05:00.166
- Shut up.

01:05:00.167 --> 01:05:04.449
- EVE Online is a massive,
multiplayer online game

01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:08.559
which you play by logging onto
an online server somewhere

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.399
and you start playing
it together with

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.349
a lot of other people.

01:05:12.350 --> 01:05:15.059
- Felt like a perfect fit because
what they were doing was

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:17.269
completely based around
stories that were driven

01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:19.969
by the community and
so, we felt like,

01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:22.763
this is exactly
where we wanna be.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.419
- I met Hilmar for
the first time

01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:33.690
at EVE three in 2006

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.310
and at one point,
Helmar just says,

01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:39.873
"Everybody keeps
talking to us about

01:05:39.874 --> 01:05:42.999
"merging and working with
CCP, but it's like,"

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.630
"they want to add Coca
Cola with Coca Cola."

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:48.409
"You're like a cheeseburger!"

01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:49.990
"We would go great together!"

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.229
- Here comes this odd
Icelandic company

01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:57.249
that makes this
weird space game.

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:59.809
They sort of seem like the
great white hope, so to speak,

01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:02.849
that they're gonna come
in and save everything

01:06:02.850 --> 01:06:04.199
and make it awesome again,

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.679
make it bigger and
better than ever.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.479
- You all know this guy.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.219
- For me, it was huge
because ya know,

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:15.289
it'd always been a thought
of World of Darkness.

01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:18.389
I was really into revitalizing
a lot of the things

01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:21.000
that were now struggling
at White Wolf.

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:24.789
- We went through the entire
merger and acquisition

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:28.149
process in four months.

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.759
It was like drinking
from a fire hose

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.410
that was full of
Icelandic vodka.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.165
- All of the hardcore fans
is like where is the stuff.

01:06:50.166 --> 01:06:52.659
Here, have our money.

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.409
But nothing was
really happening,

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:56.620
so that was frustrating.

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:09.089
- This point, White Wolf's
community was a mess.

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:10.849
You got a lot of resentment.

01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:13.149
There was these broken promises.

01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:15.729
So, the idea was sort
of get em all together.

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:20.730
1300, 1400 fans of different fan
clubs all in the same room.

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:31.399
- So, we put something
together just for you guys.

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.829
This was made to capture
the mood and the feel

01:07:33.830 --> 01:07:35.599
that we're gonna try to pursue

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.645
with the World of
Darkness in a month.

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.329
- You won't believe me.

01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:46.479
In fact, I shouldn't tell you.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.910
Some secrets are best
taken to the grave.

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.649
They're all around us.

01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:53.759
They control everything.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.060
They have always been here

01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:57.690
waging their secret wars.

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:02.469
- The big question up to
that point was, ya know,

01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:05.420
which version of the World of
Darkness are they gonna make?

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:08.159
- So, behind the scenes,
we've been working on it

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.059
for three years
and we still have

01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.249
a very long way to go.

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:14.009
So, that brings me
to the announcement

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:15.979
that I know a lot of you
guys have been speculating

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.749
about for a long time, which is,

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:21.969
what version of what
White Wolf product

01:08:21.970 --> 01:08:23.850
is this game gonna be based on?

01:08:24.979 --> 01:08:26.189
The answer is...

01:08:38.649 --> 01:08:40.700
- You thought you were
at a rock concert.

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:43.319
- That was the moment
when I realized,

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:45.408
"Holy shit, they're
bringing it back."

01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:46.609
"It's coming back."

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:55.916
- When they said that, I
felt role playing games

01:08:55.917 --> 01:08:57.890
matter again to me.

01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:02.269
- This was the
ultimate validating

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:04.359
holy shit moment.

01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:06.019
We're going back
to what's awesome

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:08.089
and we're gonna spend
millions of dollars

01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:11.861
on the franchise you
grew up with, you loved.

01:09:11.862 --> 01:09:16.862
- It was terrifying and
exciting and cathartic.

01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:22.299
We are gonna be able
to walk into a living,

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:27.300
breathing digital world and
it was going to be glorious.

01:09:31.544 --> 01:09:32.899
- It was huge.

01:09:32.899 --> 01:09:36.399
The level of excitement,
all the old grievances

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:38.019
sort of swept away.

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:40.429
We announced we were gonna
do this 20th anniversary

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:41.263
printed book.

01:09:41.264 --> 01:09:43.460
Tim Bradstreet was gonna
come back and do the art.

01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:48.939
- Doing V20, for me, it
was revisiting, ya know,

01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:50.220
an ex-lover in a way.

01:09:51.109 --> 01:09:54.109
Here we are, we're gonna
go down this road again

01:09:54.109 --> 01:09:55.730
and it had been a while.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.270
Felt great.

01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:02.469
- People had gotten the
book back in their hands

01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:03.789
the way they did originally.

01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:07.280
They got to share stories and
reconnect with old friends.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.149
- Even thought traditional
role playing games

01:10:10.150 --> 01:10:12.554
were far less popular than
they had been in the 90s,

01:10:12.555 --> 01:10:15.390
people who were fans were
still playing these games.

01:10:16.429 --> 01:10:19.479
LARPing was super popular
all around the world

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.260
during that whole period.

01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:27.739
- There was a community
aspect to playing this game

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:31.970
that really transcended
just fun and escapism.

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.919
- What's special about
role playing is that

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.529
you have a very clear
purpose typically

01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:41.539
and you, very often, have a
strong sense of belonging.

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.639
The characters are
very rarely isolated

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.740
and that can be quite
liberating, I think.

01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:51.349
- Story telling is the
currency of human contact

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:54.329
and that is exactly at
the very heart of what

01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:55.530
role playing is.

01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:59.079
- Even if we don't necessarily
know we are called players,

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.829
you do belong to this collective

01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:04.539
and it has this sort of
transformational potential

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:05.560
for everybody.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.869
As you get so caught up in
the moment, that you forget

01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:11.409
that you don't think you
have leadership skills

01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:13.139
and you stand up and lead.

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.949
Then, after the event,
you're like, "Wait, what?"

01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:17.669
"I was a leader?"

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:19.419
That's still something
that you did

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:24.010
and nobody can take
that away from you.

01:11:29.815 --> 01:11:31.729
- Making video games
is really hard.

01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:36.399
It's really hard
and making an MMO

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.959
is even harder on top of
that because of the sheer

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.209
volume of systems and
scope of those systems

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:44.839
and players who need to be put
in contact with one another.

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:47.639
- We knew this, but it was
also kind of mock through

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.860
within CCP, we know it is
going to be incredibly hard.

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:54.339
But impossible is nothing.

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.300
We eat the impossible
for breakfast.

01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:59.621
We did EVE and we're
gonna do this.

01:12:09.477 --> 01:12:13.149
- In the MMO, a lot of what
the creative director wanted

01:12:13.150 --> 01:12:16.739
was players to be able to
express themselves visually

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:19.219
and the idea here was the
players would be able to wear

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:20.399
whatever they wanted.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.839
So, visually, they could
create this look for them.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:25.890
So, we had multiple fashion
designers working at CCP.

01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:38.369
- CCP approached
me to bring me on

01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:42.035
as a designer because they
wanted to honor the tradition

01:12:42.036 --> 01:12:45.409
of World of Darkness
and it's aesthetic

01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:48.581
but at the same time,
push it forward.

01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:54.870
My aesthetic is very tribal
and has goth elements to it.

01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.110
I gravitate towards a darkness.

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:09.529
I came on as the role of
Digital Fashion Editor

01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:12.109
where I worked with a
team of illustrators

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:14.459
and we created
fashion collections

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.470
that represented
each of the clans.

01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:19.900
I thought it was just
such an incredible world.

01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:36.089
This was the first jacket
that has ever been created

01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:39.689
digitally from an
actual fashion piece.

01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:41.799
We took this jacket and
we put it into the.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.379
World of Darkness environment

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:47.139
where the characters were
able to wear the jacket

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:48.350
within the game setting.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.999
We were able to digitally
make everyone's fantasy

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.790
and something that you would
dream of wearing in real life.

01:14:47.884 --> 01:14:49.209
- I like to be complimented.

01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:50.939
I like to be told
how awesome I am

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:52.870
and ya know, I'm cool.

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.593
Yeah, it's always,
ever since I was a

01:15:00.594 --> 01:15:04.769
really little kid,
it's always been about

01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:06.150
putting on the costume.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.529
When I start to put
on the costume,

01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:21.400
I start to kind of just
distance myself from myself.

01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:29.169
It's always fascinating
when I realize

01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:30.749
I can see the moment
when it's clicked,

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:34.619
that I've transitioned from
Caroline to the character.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:39.160
Sometimes it's a very
noticeable click almost,

01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:41.980
like switching the
channel on a TV.

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:51.780
With Requiem, I like to play
the more apologetic monster.

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:55.300
I don't necessarily
enjoy what I do,

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:57.900
but a girl's gotta eat.

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:09.149
With Masquerade, there is
so much more opportunities

01:16:09.150 --> 01:16:13.089
for me to decide
that I'm a monster

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:14.800
and I feel good about it.

01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:21.059
Some days, I want to
explore a part of me

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:24.109
that I might shy away
from or that I don't

01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:27.539
quite understand why
I'm like that and LARP

01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:30.139
gives me a cheaper
alternative to therapy

01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:31.140
to explore myself.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.099
- Role playing has a
long history of being

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.809
your self therapy
from I think it was

01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:46.129
in the 20s or 30s where
it first started

01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:50.009
in the sense of be your mother
as she leaves your father.

01:16:50.010 --> 01:16:52.118
It's right around the
standard through that.

01:16:52.119 --> 01:16:53.599
That's role playing.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.919
- There are therapeutic
methods that look a lot like

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:59.499
role playing and you
never know which thing,

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:02.699
which random moment in this LARP

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:05.518
or role playing game is going
to resonate with something

01:17:05.519 --> 01:17:08.789
in your life, that suddenly,
something in your mind clicks

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:11.079
and you're like, "Hey, this
reminds me of that thing."

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.899
If you're not prepared for that,

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:15.328
then it can be a little scary.

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:50.329
- When you engage
something so deep,

01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:55.330
so dark, so personal in that
intimate kind of a way,

01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:00.270
you carry that with
you wherever you are.

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:18.299
- EVE was the economic engine
that drove the company.

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:21.699
CCP had raised capital to
develop two new projects,

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:24.299
DUST 514 in it's Shanghai office

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.550
and World of Darkness
in it's Atlanta office.

01:18:28.271 --> 01:18:33.271
- The problem starts when EVE
starts to lose subscribers.

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:36.432
Now, we're seeing a
trajectory where

01:18:36.433 --> 01:18:38.829
it's not really going up.

01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:41.479
It's just going down.

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.119
So, we're like whoa.

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.870
We need to do
something about this.

01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:49.329
So basically, all teams
in all continents

01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:50.610
go to work on EVE.

01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:54.169
- CCP was a good
company to work for,

01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:56.529
but once you sell something
to someone else,

01:18:56.530 --> 01:18:57.780
it's theirs.

01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:01.989
White Wolf was now
part of that company

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:06.760
and White Wolf needs were
subservient to CCPs at that point.

01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:11.639
- All of the resources
we needed to make the.

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:14.509
World of Darkness MMO
were actually being

01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:18.549
taken away from us and our
project was suffering for it.

01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:20.319
- The following news that we got

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.839
was that workers at
White Wolf is fired.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:28.094
So we're like okay,
this is bad probably.

01:19:32.770 --> 01:19:34.559
- You don't come back from that.

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.699
Yes, it took a few more
years for the project

01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:40.270
to get shut down completely,
but that's the point where

01:19:40.271 --> 01:19:42.749
the company, basically
the fans I think,

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:43.900
just didn't believe it.

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.480
- The decision comes
to shut it down.

01:19:53.484 --> 01:19:55.650
Ya know, I'm part
of that decision.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.070
There was only a second
who made that decision.

01:20:05.231 --> 01:20:07.760
You could say I
killed it but, yeah.

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:18.919
- I felt a huge amount of
responsibility towards

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.659
the fans and I still do.

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:24.109
I mean, it made me feel
terrible to feel like

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:26.829
all these people had put
in so much effort and time

01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:29.119
and belief and faith.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.510
It made me feel terrible.

01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:38.080
- They canceled the MMO,

01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:42.330
it felt like, okay,
this is the end.

01:21:03.488 --> 01:21:08.199
- In many ways, World of
Darkness helped some of us geeks

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.889
come to terms with
being who we were

01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:12.490
and that hadn't happened before.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.249
- Created a complete
cultural movement.

01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:19.849
It was something that
opened people's eyes

01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:23.960
to being able to express yourself
in a whole different way.

01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:30.119
- You know that feeling
you've had when you've

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.970
walked out of certain movies
and you just feel different.

01:21:34.530 --> 01:21:37.980
As an entity, it
exists in that way and

01:21:40.970 --> 01:21:43.099
it's pretty special.

01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.400
It's a very special thing.

01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:51.719
- When you have somebody
come up to you and say,

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.379
"I read your book."

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:55.919
"It changed my life."

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.469
You're just humbled by that.

01:21:57.470 --> 01:22:00.620
It's just like writing the
book's changed our lives too.

01:22:11.739 --> 01:22:13.779
- We Rabnos are so few now.

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:15.100
We're so very few.

01:22:17.746 --> 01:22:18.810
But we are strong

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:21.140
and we are clever

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.089
and when we band together,

01:22:24.090 --> 01:22:26.110
we are a force to
be reckoned with.

01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:30.469
Our hope is to rise again,

01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:33.259
to reignite that passion
that we used to feel

01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:35.200
and to drink in a
new generation.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.609
- It's just time for there
to be a new expression

01:22:41.610 --> 01:22:44.429
of the World of Darkness
in a way that will

01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:47.859
capture the imagination
of millions,

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:49.630
millions of fans.

01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:18.519
- There's a lot of
different groups of people

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.849
that you'd never get to meet
if you didn't play the game,

01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:22.170
so it's a beautiful thing.

01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:29.170
- As soon you join in,
the community's lovely.

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:32.759
You find this really
broadening network

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:34.060
that you can connect with.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.179
- Role playing has
changed my life

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:39.459
in so many ways.

01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:42.279
It brings a sense of
understanding between people.

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:43.730
That's why we're here, right?

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:49.079
- We just have it
in us, this quest

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:50.550
and this thirst for darkness.

01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:54.369
I think World of Darkness
really brings out

01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:57.240
other parts of who we are
and who our souls are.
