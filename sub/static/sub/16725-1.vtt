01:28.213 --> 01:29.505
Ohh! No!

01:29.715 --> 01:31.299
Ohh! Ohh!

01:32.468 --> 01:33.760
Ohh! No!

02:46.792 --> 02:48.876
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

02:49.086 --> 02:51.838
Blood! Blood!

04:23.722 --> 04:24.347
Are you stating, Counsel,

04:24.556 --> 04:27.183
you're not gonna offer any
contradictory psychiatric testimony?

04:27.392 --> 04:29.060
Yes, Your Honor.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.312
On the basis of this staff report,

04:31.521 --> 04:34.065
Norman Bates is judged
restored to sanity

04:34.274 --> 04:35.358
and is ordered released forthwith.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.902
What about his victims?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.905
Don't they have any say?

04:41.114 --> 04:42.657
Can you restore them?

04:42.866 --> 04:45.076
Madam, please sit down.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.161
This matter is being represented
by the district attorney.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.830
Your Honor,
my name is Mrs. Lila Loomis.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.501
I have a petition here
signed by 743 people

04:53.710 --> 04:55.378
against Norman Bates' release,

04:55.587 --> 04:58.798
including the relatives
of the seven people he murdered.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.925
Doesn't that give me the right
to speak out?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.969
Has the district attorney
advised Mrs. Loomis

05:03.178 --> 05:04.720
about her rights in this matter?

05:04.930 --> 05:05.763
Yes, Your Honor.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.933
I explained that her petition
had no effect on these proceedings.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.685
Have you explained to her
that this hearing

05:10.894 --> 05:12.478
- is a matter of law and not a motion?
- Why are you people just sitting here?

05:12.688 --> 05:13.896
Don't you realize they're gonna
release a homicidal maniac?

05:14.106 --> 05:15.690
Mrs. Loomis,
I'm gonna ask you to sit down,

05:15.899 --> 05:18.401
or I'll have the bailiff remove you
from this courtroom.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.444
If you have any further questions,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.071
please discuss them
with the district attorney

05:22.281 --> 05:23.406
after this hearing.

05:23.615 --> 05:24.699
Why bother?

05:24.908 --> 05:26.033
It's all too obvious...

05:26.243 --> 05:29.078
our courts protect the criminals,
not their victims.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.373
She's got a good point.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.542
Congratulations, Norman.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.461
Turning now
to calendar number 71143.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.171
Is that all there is to it?

05:39.381 --> 05:42.216
That's all there is to it, all right.
Let's go.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.555
Let the record reflect
the defendant is present with counsel.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.223
Just like I said, they let him go.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.975
I'll call you later.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.435
Are you satisfied, Doctor?

05:52.644 --> 05:54.645
Turning a murderer loose
on an innocent public?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.897
Mrs. Loomis,
Norman was not convicted of murder.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.108
He was found not guilty
by reason of insanity.

05:59.318 --> 06:00.735
- And since he is no longer insane...
- That is just legal hocus-pocus.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.528
...he has as much of a right
to his own life as you and I.

06:02.738 --> 06:06.824
And when he murders again,
you will be directly responsible.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.115
Well, this belongs to Mr. Toomey
who runs the motel.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.575
Want me to find him?
I'll introduce you.

06:49.785 --> 06:52.161
No, no. It'll... It'll wait.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.343
What's the matter?

07:07.552 --> 07:10.096
Uh, I saw someone.

07:10.305 --> 07:11.639
Where?

07:11.848 --> 07:13.474
In that window.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.976
They haven't had a tenant
in the house for years.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.229
I guess I'm just nervous.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.358
Well, that's understandable
under the circumstances.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.527
Yeah.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.839
Well, this is it.

07:45.048 --> 07:45.840
Yeah.

07:48.176 --> 07:51.762
You don't have to stay here, you know.
I could find you a place in town.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.433
No, no. I... I want to stay here.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.227
Then, as long as you realize

07:58.437 --> 08:03.232
that the memories
are more likely to reoccur here...

08:03.442 --> 08:05.901
But you know how to handle that now,
don't you?

08:06.111 --> 08:07.319
Sure.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.157
You start work at noon today.
Don't forget.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.616
No, I won't.

08:13.827 --> 08:14.994
I don't suppose you will.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.749
What's wrong?

08:20.959 --> 08:22.918
Oh, nothing, really.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.087
I just wish there hadn't been
all those cutbacks.

08:25.297 --> 08:28.549
There'd be a trained social worker
to look in on you from time to time.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.384
Well, I have you, don't I?

08:30.594 --> 08:31.635
Damn right you do.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.596
I had the phone reconnected.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.639
Any trouble, use it.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.265
Okay.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.733
Thanks, Doctor, for everything.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.166
Mother?

09:45.252 --> 09:46.126
Norman.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.889
Norman...

09:59.099 --> 10:02.226
what did you put in my tea?

10:02.811 --> 10:06.272
Gonna get you for this, Norman.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.692
Gonna show you what happens

10:09.901 --> 10:14.238
to bad little boys
who poison their mothers.

10:15.699 --> 10:18.409
I'm going to kill you!

11:06.499 --> 11:07.541
Can I help you?

11:07.751 --> 11:12.296
I'm Norman. Norman Bates.
The new cook's helper.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.465
Oh, yes. Dr. What's-His-Name
called about you.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.716
Raymond.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.843
I'm the one who urged Mr. Statler
to give you the job.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.471
I think it's very Christian
to forgive and forget, don't you?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.640
- I sure do.
- So do I.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.477
Myrna, this is Norman Bates.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.853
That's Myrna, Norman.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.480
Come on, I'll introduce you
to Mr. Statler.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.607
He's in the back.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.108
Ralph, this is Norman Bates.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.027
Yeah, okay, Scott,
but you have to tell me why.

11:35.236 --> 11:35.653
Just give me...

11:35.862 --> 11:38.530
Ralph, this is Norman Bates,
your new helper.

11:38.740 --> 11:41.325
Hi. Get him an apron,
will you, Mrs. Spool?

11:41.534 --> 11:43.911
Scott, we have to talk about it
sometime!

11:44.120 --> 11:45.371
Step on it, would you, girl?

11:45.580 --> 11:47.623
You're being paid to wait on tables,
not gab on the phone.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.667
Look, I'll call you back later.
We'll talk then, okay?

11:49.876 --> 11:51.001
- Okay, bye.
- We're getting ready for rush hour.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.462
He's really very nice
once he catches his breath.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.923
Hey, Queen for a Day,
want to try being a waitress?

11:56.132 --> 11:57.841
Mary, this is Norman.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.052
He's gonna be working back here.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.887
Hi.

12:02.097 --> 12:04.890
Boyfriend troubles.
Poor child.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.059
Heart of gold but head of wood.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.895
Let's get that apron for you, shall we?

12:16.611 --> 12:17.986
Here you go.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.952
Jesus Christ, girl,
what have you broken this time?

12:25.161 --> 12:28.205
It wasn't her fault, Mr. Statler.
It was me. I... I did it.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.748
Well, let her pick up,

12:29.958 --> 12:32.835
and you get back here
before you do any more damage.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.045
Thanks.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.551
Here. Bates.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.810
Here, put these up there
under the hot lights

12:50.019 --> 12:51.395
and read the orders off.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.649
On the wheel.
On the wheel.

12:55.859 --> 12:56.859
Oh.

12:58.403 --> 13:04.324
Uh, two meatloaf sandwiches
and one mashed potato with gravy.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.285
And one baked potato.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.748
Okay, go ahead, go ahead, do it.
See if I care.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.083
No, no. Scott?

13:13.293 --> 13:15.544
I didn't mean it.
Listen to me.

13:15.754 --> 13:19.631
Hello?

13:21.050 --> 13:22.468
Bastard.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.096
- You all right?
- 'Course I'm all right!

13:26.306 --> 13:27.514
- Where you going?
- Into town.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.766
Now, will you please leave me alone?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.518
If you're going into town,
you're heading in the wrong direction.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.069
Look, I... I don't know
what happened,

13:41.279 --> 13:42.905
but, uh, why don't you let me
call you a cab?

13:43.114 --> 13:43.739
Why?

13:43.948 --> 13:46.116
Why?
So you can get home safely.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.204
I don't have a home.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.330
No home?

13:51.539 --> 13:53.415
I've been living with my boyfriend
for over a year,

13:53.625 --> 13:55.751
and all of a sudden,
he tells me we're through.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.670
And then I just phoned him
to ask him why,

13:58.880 --> 13:59.546
and he wouldn't tell me.

13:59.756 --> 14:03.425
All he'd say is that I couldn't
come back to our apartment.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.135
Well, what are you... What...
What are you gonna do?

14:05.345 --> 14:06.804
Call a friend in town, I guess.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.139
See if somebody will let me
crash with them for the night.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.558
What about your parents?
Uh, couldn't you stay with them?

14:11.768 --> 14:13.393
They're in Portland.

14:13.603 --> 14:16.021
And they don't care
what happens to me, anyway.

14:16.231 --> 14:20.734
Well, I own a motel
not too far from here,

14:20.944 --> 14:22.653
and you'd be welcome
to spend the night

14:22.862 --> 14:24.655
in one of the empty rooms
if you'd like.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.991
F.O.C. Of course.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.577
- What?
- Free of charge.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.287
Oh.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.625
But, no, that's very nice of you,
but I don't want to impose.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.710
You wouldn't be imposing.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.672
Coworkers ought to
help each other out, don't you think?

14:42.549 --> 14:45.884
Is that why you covered for me today
when I broke that pie plate?

14:46.094 --> 14:47.177
Yeah.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.097
I figured you'd get into more trouble
for it than I would.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.306
You're not kidding.

14:51.516 --> 14:52.641
I've been working there four days,

14:52.851 --> 14:55.769
and I've broken a dozen dishes
already.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.813
You sure it's all right
if I stay at your motel?

14:58.022 --> 14:59.439
Oh, absolutely.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.985
Come on, let's get going.
It looks like rain.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.297
Well, we almost made it.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.257
You didn't get too wet, did you?

15:25.466 --> 15:27.384
- No, I'm all right.
- Oh.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.677
Do you own all this?

15:28.887 --> 15:29.970
Oh, yeah.

15:30.179 --> 15:34.224
Well, it isn't much,
but I'll get it fixed up eventually.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.603
Well, let me get you a room key.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.772
Mr. Toomey?

15:58.625 --> 16:01.585
Why don't you wait here
while I check the room?

16:01.794 --> 16:04.755
Uh, just to make sure
the linen's fresh.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.024
Well, you thinking
about stealing something?

16:25.109 --> 16:26.610
There's no reason to be scared,
sweetheart.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.820
I manage this dump.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.282
What do you want, a room?

16:33.701 --> 16:35.410
Norman's already getting me one,
thank you.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.208
You're with Bates?

16:42.335 --> 16:44.503
Well, uh, you must be Norman Bates.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.047
I'm Warren Toomey.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.591
Mary, why don't you go up
to the house?

16:49.801 --> 16:52.427
The... The front door is open.

16:52.637 --> 16:53.428
Is something wrong with the room?

16:53.638 --> 16:57.224
No. Just... Just... Just...
Just go up and wait for me, okay?

16:57.433 --> 17:01.019
- Look, it doesn't matter...
- Look, just do as I say, okay?

17:05.692 --> 17:08.276
She's pretty cute.
Where'd you find her?

17:08.486 --> 17:10.069
What's this stuff?

17:12.615 --> 17:15.325
I'd say it was drugs.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.452
What about the occupied cabins?

17:17.662 --> 17:19.746
Is that what's going on in there, too?

17:19.955 --> 17:20.914
Yeah.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.082
Boy, this town.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.542
If it isn't the parents, it's the kids.

17:24.752 --> 17:25.419
I caught a couple of 'em

17:25.627 --> 17:27.878
screwin' in the basement
of your house up there last week.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.297
'Course, I threw 'em right out.

17:29.507 --> 17:31.508
Can you believe that?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.468
What kind of a motel
are you running here?

17:38.975 --> 17:40.934
The kind that makes money.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.645
People come here to party.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.148
They stay a few hours,
and then they leave.

17:46.357 --> 17:47.357
What more are you gonna ask
from a motel

17:47.567 --> 17:49.484
so far from the beaten track, huh?

17:49.694 --> 17:50.610
You're fired.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.822
Hey, you can't fire me.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.991
I was hired by the hospital board.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.493
The state has no claim on me
or my property anymore,

17:58.703 --> 17:59.870
and neither do you.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.747
I want you out of here tomorrow.

18:01.956 --> 18:05.167
Yeah, well, why don't you try
putting me out, Mr. Wacko, hmm?

18:05.376 --> 18:06.585
I'd like to see that.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.879
I won't have to.
I'll just go to the police.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.381
I'm sure they'd be very interested
in what's been going on here,

18:11.591 --> 18:13.550
especially the drugs.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.428
Tomorrow, Mr. Toomey.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.931
And don't rent out any more rooms
in this motel. No more.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.608
At least my customers
have a good time.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.194
What'd yours get, Bates, huh?

18:32.403 --> 18:34.196
Dead! That's what they got!

18:34.405 --> 18:38.158
Dead!
Murdered by you, you loony!

18:46.000 --> 18:46.833
Hi.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.127
What was all the yelling about?

18:49.337 --> 18:50.629
Oh.

18:50.838 --> 18:55.842
My motel manager and I
just had a fight.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.678
Wasn't because of me, was it?

18:58.888 --> 19:00.180
No.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.475
Why are you sitting in the dark?

19:03.684 --> 19:05.852
I was just thinking about scott.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.896
Maybe if I hadn't blown up at him
so quick,

19:08.106 --> 19:10.690
we would've worked things out.

19:10.900 --> 19:15.237
Yeah, maybe. I... I don't know.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.534
Is that... better?

19:21.786 --> 19:23.995
Do you think I should call him
and talk to him again?

19:25.123 --> 19:26.623
Oh, sure.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.435
Hi, Scott?

19:50.690 --> 19:51.982
Are you all right?

19:53.192 --> 19:54.276
What were you talking about?

19:54.485 --> 19:55.902
Listen, I didn't mean it.

19:56.112 --> 19:58.238
Are you still mad at me?

19:59.740 --> 20:02.159
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.619
I'm... I'm at this motel.

20:05.454 --> 20:09.416
No, I didn't get wet.
I got here just as the storm started.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.795
Look, I can take care of myself.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.256
No, of course not.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.592
I said I'd be all right.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.930
Okay!

20:27.059 --> 20:29.019
Look, I can't talk any longer.
I got to go.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.532
Oh.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.034
How did it go?

20:44.243 --> 20:47.037
Terrible. I found out why he
didn't want me to come home tonight.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.371
Oh. Well, why?

20:48.581 --> 20:52.250
He's got somebody new.
He's moved her in already.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.670
Well, that's no good.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.214
Oh, well.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.007
Think how it would've been
if I'd married him

20:59.217 --> 21:01.676
and then found out
what sort of guy he was.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.553
He asked me to, you know?

21:03.763 --> 21:06.514
Sure.
I mean, I'm sure he did.

21:06.724 --> 21:10.185
- Oh, have... have you had dinner yet?
- No.

21:10.394 --> 21:13.605
Well, let... let's have it together.
I was just about to sit down.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.732
It's just, uh, sandwiches and milk,

21:15.942 --> 21:18.109
but you're more than welcome
to share it.

21:18.319 --> 21:19.653
- I really don't feel like...
- No, no. Do... Do it. Do it.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.071
Do it for my sake.

21:21.280 --> 21:25.492
Starving yourself isn't gonna
make anything any better, either.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.035
All right.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.120
But this is yours.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.666
No, go ahead. You... You have it.
I'll make myself another.

21:34.585 --> 21:36.753
Do you have a knife?

21:36.963 --> 21:38.546
No, I'm afraid I don't.

21:38.756 --> 21:42.175
I... I just moved back here
after being many years away,

21:42.385 --> 21:46.846
and I forgot to bring any cutlery.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.390
That's odd.

21:48.599 --> 21:52.978
People usually leave something,
even if it is only an old butter knife.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.522
Oh, there.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.414
Something wrong, Norman?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.218
Um...

22:25.428 --> 22:27.012
Aren't you going to eat?

22:27.221 --> 22:31.850
No. I... I just suddenly lost my appetite,
but you... you go ahead.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.435
Enjoy it.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.863
I guess I'm like you.
I... I suddenly lost my appetite, too.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.949
Oh, would you like something else?

22:48.159 --> 22:50.493
- There's cookies for dessert.
- Oh, no, no, thank you.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.079
Uh, can I use your phone again?

22:53.289 --> 22:55.373
Sure.
Who you gonna call?

22:55.583 --> 22:58.168
Um, I just remembered this girlfriend
I have in town.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.128
I... I mean, she's kind of a girlfriend,

23:00.338 --> 23:03.381
and, uh, maybe she'd let me
spend the night with her.

23:03.591 --> 23:06.551
Well, I thought
you were gonna stay here.

23:06.761 --> 23:10.472
There's a spare room upstairs,
and you're more than welcome to it.

23:10.681 --> 23:12.891
Uh, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.434
Why?

23:16.479 --> 23:18.313
I don't mean to hurt your feelings
or anything,

23:18.522 --> 23:22.192
but... Myrna was talking about you
at the diner today.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.236
Mrs. Spool kept on telling her
to shush, but she wouldn't.

23:25.446 --> 23:26.988
She said you'd been locked up.

23:30.368 --> 23:31.743
Did she say why?

23:32.578 --> 23:34.120
Well, I'll tell you.

23:34.330 --> 23:37.791
When I was 12,
my mother went mad,

23:38.000 --> 23:41.127
so I... put some poison in her tea.

23:41.337 --> 23:42.545
You know?

23:43.714 --> 23:45.840
I'm... I'm all right now.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.008
You sure?

23:47.218 --> 23:48.134
Sure.

23:48.344 --> 23:49.844
Otherwise they wouldn't have
given me a job

23:50.054 --> 23:51.596
in a diner, would they?

23:51.806 --> 23:54.015
I don't know.
It takes a nut to work there.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.561
Boy...

23:58.771 --> 24:02.190
Look, I'm... I'm sorry,
but I don't want to...

24:02.400 --> 24:06.569
What if I told you
that I needed you to stay?

24:06.779 --> 24:08.696
Why would you need me?

24:08.906 --> 24:11.408
Because this is the first night
I've spent in this house in years,

24:11.617 --> 24:13.701
much less alone.

24:14.203 --> 24:18.039
Lot of my troubles
had to do with this house.

24:18.249 --> 24:24.003
So, you see, I'm as scared as you are,
just for different reasons.

24:24.338 --> 24:27.132
- I'm sorry, but I...
- Please.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.553
That bad, huh?

24:46.569 --> 24:47.360
No.

24:47.570 --> 24:48.903
Not... Not... Not that one, no.

24:49.113 --> 24:50.947
This one over there.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.657
What's wrong with this one?

24:52.867 --> 24:56.453
Well, that, uh...
used to belong to my mother.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.830
But she's dead, isn't she?

24:59.039 --> 25:00.665
Yeah.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.501
Is this the room
where you had your troubles?

25:03.711 --> 25:05.795
One of 'em, yeah.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.547
Well, I don't know what happened
to you in the past, Norman,

25:07.756 --> 25:10.300
but you're never gonna get over it,
not unless you face it.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.229
See? No ghosts.

25:27.109 --> 25:28.276
No.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.907
- I could sleep here.
- No, I'd, uh...

25:34.116 --> 25:35.200
Why not?

25:35.409 --> 25:37.702
I'd just rather you didn't.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.498
What happened in here
that scared you so?

25:45.586 --> 25:48.046
Let me show you the room
across the hall, okay?

25:58.349 --> 26:00.975
You'll be, uh... just fine in here.

26:01.185 --> 26:01.976
Oh, the, uh...

26:03.145 --> 26:04.145
The bathroom?

26:04.980 --> 26:07.649
Is right over there.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.150
Uh, well,

26:09.360 --> 26:13.530
I guess it's time to, uh,
to go to sleep.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.031
Okay.

26:45.396 --> 26:47.647
Good night, Mary.

27:32.735 --> 27:34.152
- About time, girl.
- Sorry.

27:34.361 --> 27:36.362
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:36.572 --> 27:38.364
Sorry I missed you this morning.

27:38.574 --> 27:41.117
I got up early and went into town
to see my girlfriend.

27:41.327 --> 27:44.329
You know,
the one I was telling you about.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.748
- Guess what.
- What?

27:46.957 --> 27:49.292
We're going to room together.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.587
Well, you're more than welcome
to stay with me, you know.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.089
Thanks, but I'd really rather live
in town.

27:55.299 --> 27:56.883
Oh, in town, yeah.

27:57.593 --> 28:00.219
My... my place is a lot closer to work.

28:00.429 --> 28:03.222
No, I... I really don't think
that's a good idea.

28:03.432 --> 28:05.516
Okay.
Well, if you change your mind.

28:05.726 --> 28:08.645
Hey, girl, I gave you the morning off,
not the afternoon.

28:08.854 --> 28:09.479
Hop to it.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.356
Charming, isn't he?

28:13.150 --> 28:15.902
Chop up some more lettuce,
will you, Norman?

28:34.588 --> 28:35.755
Hey, Ralph.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.758
So, uh, how's your new helper doin'?

28:38.967 --> 28:41.260
Hi, Warren.
Just fine, thanks.

28:41.470 --> 28:42.387
Yeah.

28:42.596 --> 28:47.600
Well, I hope he washes dishes
better than he runs a motel.

29:05.119 --> 29:06.994
Oh, incidentally, could I have
the salad dressing on the side?

29:07.204 --> 29:10.415
Hey, can I get a little service
around here or what, huh?

29:10.624 --> 29:13.334
- Okay.
- Hey, cutie! Come here.

29:13.544 --> 29:16.337
Oh, hello.
Uh, what would you like?

29:16.547 --> 29:20.550
I'd like some of what
Norman got last night.

29:21.844 --> 29:23.678
Pardon?

29:23.887 --> 29:25.054
You heard me, sweetheart.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.599
Why don't you look at a menu
and I'll be right back?

29:31.270 --> 29:33.354
What happened between you
and that man last night?

29:33.564 --> 29:34.439
I fired him.

29:34.648 --> 29:37.358
Oh, great.
He's on my station.

29:37.568 --> 29:38.735
What did he say?

29:38.944 --> 29:40.611
Nothing nice,
and I think he's been drinking.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.864
He sure smells like it.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.615
Hey, you do have other tables,
honey,

29:44.825 --> 29:47.034
or do you want me
to wait on those, too?

29:47.244 --> 29:50.747
Talk about the customers
being nasty.

29:52.875 --> 29:55.293
- Excuse me, do you still work here?
- Yeah.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.086
Then, could I please have my orders?

29:57.296 --> 29:58.463
Oh.

30:23.864 --> 30:25.656
So, what's it like?

30:25.866 --> 30:27.241
What's what like?

30:27.451 --> 30:29.869
Screwin' a psycho.

30:31.413 --> 30:33.706
Would you mind removing your foot?

30:34.541 --> 30:35.792
Next.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.505
Two turkey sandwiches
on whole-wheat toast,

30:40.714 --> 30:42.173
one BLT, hold the mayo.

30:42.382 --> 30:45.134
I'll get the tomatoes, Mr. Statler.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.640
Hey, I suppose
you didn't spend last night

30:50.849 --> 30:52.350
alone with him in that house, huh?

30:52.559 --> 30:55.102
You got strange taste in men, honey.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.522
Just because two people sleep
under the same roof

30:57.731 --> 31:00.107
doesn't necessarily mean
they've made love.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.234
Since when, huh?

31:01.443 --> 31:04.529
Or are you the kind
that doesn't, uh, kiss and tell?

31:08.116 --> 31:09.575
You really want to know
what Norman's like?

31:09.785 --> 31:11.661
Yeah.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.830
Better than you'll ever be, fat boy.

31:20.838 --> 31:22.129
Cut it out, Toomey!

31:22.339 --> 31:23.506
Norman?

31:23.715 --> 31:25.800
- Are you talkin' to me, wacko?
- Come on.

31:29.304 --> 31:30.805
Come on.

31:31.014 --> 31:31.848
Come on! Huh?

31:32.057 --> 31:33.432
- Johnny, please, let's go.
- What's wrong?

31:39.273 --> 31:42.233
Oh. Oh, that's... that's beautiful.
Go on, psycho, pick it up.

31:42.442 --> 31:44.235
Come on, pick it up!

31:44.444 --> 31:46.779
What's the matter,
you lose your nerve, huh?

31:46.989 --> 31:48.364
Or do you only attack women, huh?

31:48.574 --> 31:50.241
Go on! Pick it up!

31:50.450 --> 31:51.826
Show us what you're really like.

31:52.035 --> 31:54.620
Come... Come on, loony!

31:59.835 --> 32:04.380
Ah, look! Not only is he crazy,
he's chickenshit, too!

32:06.592 --> 32:07.842
What's the trouble, Warren?

32:08.051 --> 32:11.220
The trouble is that psycho you hired.

32:12.723 --> 32:15.099
This is the last time I eat here.

32:15.309 --> 32:17.351
You're sweating all over.

32:21.815 --> 32:24.275
Can I get you something?
A glass of water, maybe?

32:24.484 --> 32:25.026
No.

32:25.235 --> 32:26.903
What the hell did you do out there?

32:27.112 --> 32:28.821
That man, Mr. Toomey,
he was trying...

32:29.031 --> 32:31.032
I'm not talkin' to you, girl.

32:31.241 --> 32:31.782
Well?

32:31.992 --> 32:35.286
He was bothering Mary,
and then he slipped me a note.

32:35.495 --> 32:36.245
What note?

32:36.455 --> 32:38.581
It's there on the wheel.

32:45.672 --> 32:46.797
There's nothing here.

32:52.429 --> 32:54.180
Look, Norman, you're tired.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.223
Why don't you take
the rest of the afternoon off?

32:56.433 --> 32:59.018
I'm telling you, it was right there.

33:00.604 --> 33:01.812
Sure it was.

33:03.106 --> 33:05.316
Don't humor me.

33:05.525 --> 33:08.486
I'm telling you
there was a note on that wheel

33:08.695 --> 33:12.114
from my dead mother.

33:23.251 --> 33:26.337
Okay, everybody,
business as usual.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.315
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.276
Is that offer to room with you
still open?

33:50.028 --> 33:51.153
Oh, sure!

33:51.363 --> 33:52.697
Great.

33:52.906 --> 33:54.323
Well, what... what happened?

33:54.533 --> 33:56.325
Oh.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.285
You know my girlfriend,
the one I told you about?

33:58.495 --> 34:00.162
- Yeah.
- Well...

34:00.372 --> 34:02.832
her boyfriend sleeps over
almost every night.

34:03.041 --> 34:03.749
Do you know what it's like

34:03.959 --> 34:05.418
trying to sleep
in a one-room apartment

34:05.627 --> 34:09.005
when a couple's making love
five feet from you?

34:10.716 --> 34:11.424
Noisy?

34:11.632 --> 34:13.551
You're not kidding.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.137
Well, I thought
you were wonderful today.

34:16.346 --> 34:17.263
Why?

34:17.472 --> 34:18.764
The way you handled
that Toomey guy?

34:18.974 --> 34:20.181
What an asshole.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.309
I could've killed him,
and you were so cool.

34:22.518 --> 34:25.603
No, I don't kill people anymore,
remember?

34:26.857 --> 34:29.150
Oh, here.

34:29.359 --> 34:30.900
- What's this?
- Fudge.

34:31.110 --> 34:33.779
My grandmother sent it to me.
She makes great fudge.

34:36.366 --> 34:38.367
Well, thank you.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.161
What about that note?
You figure out who sent it?

34:42.831 --> 34:45.206
That was just a... practical joke.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.793
Yeah, I guess so.

34:48.003 --> 34:48.835
Oh, oh, oh, let me take that.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.713
No, no, no, that's all right.
I can manage.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.380
Oh.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.091
Did you...
Did you have dinner yet?

34:54.301 --> 34:55.717
Yes, and I'm exhausted.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.970
I'm going to bed
right after I take a shower.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.972
If that's all right with you.

35:00.182 --> 35:01.891
Oh, oh, sure.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.656
Hey, wake up!

38:45.865 --> 38:48.701
Hey, you nut guys! Hey!

38:48.910 --> 38:50.327
Hey!

38:51.246 --> 38:52.496
Psycho!

38:52.706 --> 38:55.332
Hey! Hello, psycho!

38:55.542 --> 38:59.253
I just want you to know
I'm moving out! Huh?

39:16.646 --> 39:17.980
Hello?

39:18.857 --> 39:21.442
Wha... What?

39:21.651 --> 39:23.444
Who is this?

39:26.406 --> 39:28.532
My mother is dead.

39:30.035 --> 39:35.998
Mr. Toomey, if this is you,
you're sicker than I ever was.

39:43.298 --> 39:44.923
Bastard.

40:43.983 --> 40:45.150
Bill!

40:52.409 --> 40:53.951
Hi, Bill.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.829
I wasn't expecting you till tomorrow.

40:57.372 --> 40:58.664
Hi, Norman.

40:58.873 --> 40:59.998
I got a call from Mr. Statler.

41:00.208 --> 41:01.875
He said you quit your job
at the diner.

41:02.085 --> 41:05.170
Yeah. Well, I just figured I could
make more money with the motel.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.380
You know, once I get the...

41:06.589 --> 41:09.299
once I get it back into condition,
that is.

41:09.509 --> 41:11.385
What does Mr. Toomey think
about your plans?

41:11.594 --> 41:13.595
Him?
You know, I fired him.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.097
You know, he was turning this place

41:15.306 --> 41:19.393
into what I think they call
an adult motel.

41:20.687 --> 41:22.104
I see.

41:22.981 --> 41:26.066
Well... been an awful lot of changes
in the week you've been back.

41:26.276 --> 41:28.360
Yeah, yeah.

41:28.570 --> 41:29.903
Any more notes or phone calls?

41:30.113 --> 41:31.572
No. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Mnh-mnh.

41:32.782 --> 41:33.532
Who's that?

41:33.741 --> 41:36.368
- Where?
- There, in the top window.

41:36.744 --> 41:37.578
The attic?

41:37.787 --> 41:39.037
It looked like a woman.

41:39.873 --> 41:41.623
Oh, oh, oh,
that must have been Mary.

41:41.833 --> 41:42.666
Mary who?

41:42.876 --> 41:45.419
Oh, Mary.
She works with me at the diner.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.547
She's been staying here, too.

41:48.756 --> 41:50.466
Oh?

41:50.675 --> 41:54.636
Oh, it's nothing like that.
We're just, uh, we're just friends.

42:43.269 --> 42:44.937
Mary.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.241
Hi, Mary.

42:57.450 --> 42:59.243
You look great.

42:59.452 --> 43:00.827
Look, this is, uh,
this is Dr. Raymond.

43:01.037 --> 43:03.705
He was my psychiatrist
in the institution.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.251
- Hello.
- Hi.

43:07.460 --> 43:08.627
Well, what do you think?

43:08.836 --> 43:10.045
- About what?
- What Norman's doing.

43:10.922 --> 43:12.798
Has he told you his plans
for the place?

43:13.007 --> 43:14.341
Some of them.

43:15.385 --> 43:16.802
Well, I have to be going to work.

43:17.011 --> 43:18.428
Can I give you a lift?

43:19.556 --> 43:20.889
Go ahead.

43:31.568 --> 43:33.151
See you tonight.

43:48.876 --> 43:51.211
So, what can I do for you, Doctor?

43:52.589 --> 43:54.089
Oh, thank you.

43:56.134 --> 43:58.302
Are you familiar
with the Norman Bates case?

43:58.511 --> 43:59.261
Very.

43:59.470 --> 43:59.970
I was deputy here

44:00.179 --> 44:03.515
when sheriff Chambers arrested him
years ago.

44:03.725 --> 44:06.184
I reread the file
when I found out he'd been released.

44:06.394 --> 44:07.561
So, what's the trouble?

44:07.770 --> 44:09.313
Bates dressing up
as his mother again?

44:09.522 --> 44:12.065
No, nothing like that.

44:12.275 --> 44:14.735
Although, Norman says that somebody
has been leaving notes

44:14.944 --> 44:17.738
and making phone calls
claiming to be his mother.

44:17.947 --> 44:18.697
Well, people.

44:18.906 --> 44:20.490
So, what do you want me to do
about it?

44:20.700 --> 44:23.910
- Put a tap on his phone.
- Sorry, Doc, I can't do that.

44:24.120 --> 44:26.913
This is Fairvale, California,
not Washington, D.C.

44:27.123 --> 44:27.706
But I can check around

44:27.915 --> 44:30.292
and see who might hate Norman
enough to do something like that.

44:30.501 --> 44:31.793
Anything else?

44:32.003 --> 44:33.462
You could keep an eye on Norman.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.380
I have been.

44:35.590 --> 44:38.592
All right, Sheriff...

44:38.801 --> 44:41.928
here's my card
in case you should need me.

44:42.138 --> 44:43.430
Oh, there is one other thing.

44:43.640 --> 44:45.057
Yeah, of course. What?

44:45.266 --> 44:47.100
He's got a girl living with him.

44:47.310 --> 44:49.645
Uh, Mary Samuels.

44:49.854 --> 44:51.563
She works at the diner.

44:51.773 --> 44:53.315
Then, I'll check on her, too.

44:53.524 --> 44:54.524
Thank you, Sheriff.

44:54.734 --> 44:56.360
Any time.

47:52.328 --> 47:53.870
Slut?

49:16.495 --> 49:17.996
Are you sure this is safe?

49:18.205 --> 49:20.332
It always has been.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.251
Come on.

50:04.794 --> 50:05.627
Hey.

50:09.131 --> 50:11.758
Oh, I don't need any more.

50:34.907 --> 50:35.782
What was that?

50:35.992 --> 50:37.492
What?

50:37.702 --> 50:39.786
That sound in the next room.

50:39.996 --> 50:42.163
You're just stoned.

50:45.668 --> 50:47.919
I'm not.

51:02.018 --> 51:03.393
Jesus.

51:03.602 --> 51:04.436
What is it?

51:04.645 --> 51:06.021
Shh.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.528
Let's get out of here.

51:22.747 --> 51:23.913
Shh.

51:35.801 --> 51:37.385
Come on. Hurry!

51:38.512 --> 51:39.637
Josh.

51:41.140 --> 51:42.307
Look out behind you!

52:09.668 --> 52:16.132
Norman?

52:17.134 --> 52:19.344
Mary! Up here.

52:22.890 --> 52:24.265
What are you doing up here?

52:24.475 --> 52:27.227
I... I was locked in.

52:29.355 --> 52:31.397
You couldn't have been.
There's no key in the lock.

52:31.607 --> 52:35.693
Someone unlocked it...
while I was asleep.

52:35.903 --> 52:37.570
Who?

52:37.780 --> 52:39.614
Whoever's been pretending to be
my mother!

52:39.824 --> 52:41.825
Norman, what are you talking about?

52:42.034 --> 52:43.159
I saw her in the window.

52:43.369 --> 52:44.327
And just look in the room.

52:44.537 --> 52:45.995
It's all been fixed up,
and her stuff's inside.

52:46.205 --> 52:48.414
There's another note, too.

52:48.624 --> 52:51.167
I'm gonna check the back stairs.
Maybe they went down that way.

52:53.546 --> 52:55.088
Norman?

52:55.297 --> 52:56.214
What?

52:56.423 --> 52:57.590
There's no note in there.

52:59.885 --> 53:01.177
What do you mean it's not there?

53:04.932 --> 53:07.100
No, thi...

53:07.309 --> 53:09.185
This isn't how it was.

53:09.395 --> 53:12.063
It... It was all fixed up.

53:12.273 --> 53:14.399
It wasn't like this.

53:16.527 --> 53:18.319
The... The note.

53:21.699 --> 53:24.450
This... The dresses are...

53:24.952 --> 53:26.619
Who's that?

53:29.039 --> 53:31.958
Norman, you better answer the door.

53:32.710 --> 53:33.877
Yeah.

53:43.220 --> 53:44.888
Norman?

53:45.097 --> 53:47.849
Whatever you do,
don't tell 'em about the bedroom.

53:51.061 --> 53:51.728
- Hello, Norman.
- Hello.

53:51.937 --> 53:53.980
I'm sheriff Hunt.
How are you?

53:54.190 --> 53:56.482
This is Deputy Pool.

53:56.692 --> 53:57.775
Can we come in?

53:57.985 --> 54:00.153
Yes. Yes.

54:00.362 --> 54:00.987
Uh, this is...

54:01.197 --> 54:04.407
I know. Mary Samuels.

54:05.826 --> 54:07.368
Well, what... what can we do for you?

54:07.578 --> 54:09.746
There hasn't been any trouble,
has there?

54:09.955 --> 54:12.207
Yes, there has.

54:12.416 --> 54:14.125
What sort?

54:14.335 --> 54:16.211
The old sort.

54:16.420 --> 54:18.963
There's a girl sitting down
in my squad car below...

54:19.173 --> 54:20.506
too scared
to come into this house.

54:20.716 --> 54:21.174
Why?

54:21.383 --> 54:23.301
Well, she claims
that she saw her boyfriend murdered

54:23.510 --> 54:28.306
in your fruit cellar today
by a large woman dressed in black.

54:28.515 --> 54:32.185
That's just how your mother
used to look, isn't it, Norman?

54:32.394 --> 54:35.396
Well, what... what were they doing
in the cellar, anyway?

54:35.606 --> 54:39.943
Oh, what kids do today, I guess...
smokin' dope, messin' around.

54:40.778 --> 54:42.946
Do you know anything about that,
Norman?

54:44.114 --> 54:45.615
No.

54:46.992 --> 54:49.619
You mind if we look
in the fruit cellar?

54:51.455 --> 54:52.288
No.

55:04.093 --> 55:05.343
Looks clean to me.

55:05.552 --> 55:07.428
Yeah, doesn't it, though?

55:17.022 --> 55:18.690
You been straightening up down here?

55:18.899 --> 55:20.191
No, sir.

55:20.401 --> 55:21.901
This is the first time
I've been inside this room

55:22.111 --> 55:24.279
since I came home.

55:27.574 --> 55:29.826
- Then, who did it?
- I did.

55:30.035 --> 55:31.327
Several days ago.

55:31.537 --> 55:32.912
Hey, Norman?

55:34.748 --> 55:37.208
I just hate a dirty house, don't you?

55:41.255 --> 55:43.172
Why is this open?

55:43.382 --> 55:45.341
I don't know.

55:45.551 --> 55:48.511
Better put a padlock on it
before someone robs you blind.

55:48.721 --> 55:50.888
How much has he told you
about himself?

55:51.098 --> 55:52.432
Enough.

55:54.393 --> 55:56.728
You know why Norman
doesn't come down here, don't you?

55:56.937 --> 55:57.979
No, I don't.

55:59.565 --> 56:01.941
He used to keep his mother's corpse
down here.

56:02.151 --> 56:04.527
Stole it from the grave.

56:05.195 --> 56:08.823
Talked to himself in her voice,
answering in his own.

56:09.033 --> 56:10.450
What do you think of that?

56:10.659 --> 56:11.993
Horrible.

56:12.202 --> 56:13.703
That's right, it was.

56:13.912 --> 56:16.998
Now, let me ask you again.

56:17.207 --> 56:20.168
Are you positive
you cleaned up down here?

56:21.628 --> 56:23.171
Yes.

56:24.506 --> 56:26.049
All right.

56:27.760 --> 56:29.260
- Mike?
- Yeah?

56:29.470 --> 56:30.678
Let's go.

56:36.727 --> 56:38.853
Are you sure that neither one of you
heard anything this afternoon

56:39.063 --> 56:40.772
between 4:00 and 5:00?

56:40.981 --> 56:41.647
No, but I was...

56:41.857 --> 56:43.274
He was with me all afternoon.

56:43.484 --> 56:45.985
We were walking in the fields.

56:47.571 --> 56:49.030
Good-bye.

56:49.239 --> 56:51.407
Nice to see you again, Norman.

56:58.165 --> 56:59.832
Why did you do that?

57:00.042 --> 57:00.958
Do what?

57:01.168 --> 57:03.461
Lie to the sheriff.
You weren't with me this afternoon.

57:03.670 --> 57:07.298
I had to do something.
He was going to arrest you.

57:09.259 --> 57:10.385
Norman?

57:14.681 --> 57:17.308
It's starting again.

57:24.191 --> 57:25.775
- Sheriff Hunt?
- Yes?

57:25.984 --> 57:27.902
I... I'm Lila Loomis.

57:28.112 --> 57:30.196
I used to be Lila Crane.

57:30.406 --> 57:32.573
Oh, yes, of course.

57:32.783 --> 57:34.450
Well, what a coincidence.

57:34.660 --> 57:37.036
I was just thinkin' about you and sam.
How is he?

57:37.246 --> 57:40.081
My husband is dead.

57:40.290 --> 57:41.624
I'm sorry.

57:41.834 --> 57:45.336
Well, what brings you back to Fairvale
after all these years?

57:45.546 --> 57:47.380
Norman Bates.

57:47.589 --> 57:49.549
Where is he?

57:49.758 --> 57:52.009
He's out at his motel, I suppose.

57:52.219 --> 57:53.553
Why haven't you arrested him?

57:53.762 --> 57:56.139
- What for?
- For murder.

57:56.348 --> 57:59.267
It's all over town
what he did to that boy.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.644
Mrs. Loomis, I can't arrest a man
without proof,

58:01.854 --> 58:03.646
especially one with an alibi.

58:03.856 --> 58:05.690
What alibi?

58:05.899 --> 58:07.859
There's a girl
staying out there with him,

58:08.068 --> 58:11.612
and she says that he was with her
at the time the murder took place

58:11.822 --> 58:13.448
if there was a murder.

58:13.657 --> 58:17.076
Oh, well, what do you mean
"if there was a murder"?

58:17.286 --> 58:19.287
Well, what I mean
is that I am not convinced

58:19.496 --> 58:20.746
that anybody was killed.

58:20.956 --> 58:23.624
There's no body.
No corpus delicti.

58:23.834 --> 58:27.462
So let's just wait and see
if the boy comes home tonight.

58:27.671 --> 58:29.005
Have you dragged the swamp yet?

58:29.214 --> 58:29.839
What?

58:30.048 --> 58:30.882
The swamp.

58:31.091 --> 58:33.259
That's where he dumped his victims
the last time.

58:33.469 --> 58:34.552
Have you dragged it yet?

58:34.761 --> 58:36.387
No, ma'am.

58:36.597 --> 58:39.599
Well, then, I suggest you start,
before there are more murders.

58:39.808 --> 58:42.518
Unless, of course,
you want it on your conscience.

58:48.275 --> 58:50.109
What's her problem?

58:50.319 --> 58:52.487
I don't know.

58:52.696 --> 58:54.447
But if Norman Bates is crazy,

58:54.656 --> 58:56.073
there are a whole lot of people
around here

58:56.283 --> 58:58.367
runnin' him a close second.

59:01.872 --> 59:03.122
Are you sure you're all right?

59:03.332 --> 59:05.082
Yeah, I'm fine.

59:05.292 --> 59:07.126
What you need
is one of my special Irish coffees.

59:07.336 --> 59:09.629
Is there any brandy in the house?

59:09.838 --> 59:11.422
I don't know.

59:11.632 --> 59:14.050
My mother doesn't allow liquor.

59:14.885 --> 59:16.260
Mr. Toomey was a drinker, wasn't he?

59:16.470 --> 59:19.013
Did he leave a bottle in the office?

59:20.015 --> 59:21.682
I don't know. I didn't look.

59:21.892 --> 59:24.435
I'll be right back.
You rest here.

59:49.336 --> 59:50.336
Hello?

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:05.643
Why did you lie to the sheriff

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.645
and say Bates was with you
this afternoon?

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:08.980
Mother!

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:10.314
What are you doing here?

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:12.024
Go back to the hotel
before you ruin everything.

01:00:12.234 --> 01:00:14.860
Answer my question.
Why did you alibi Bates?

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:15.987
I didn't alibi him.

01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:19.282
Don't lie to me.
I talked to the sheriff.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.954
Why did you do it?

01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:28.583
Because Norman
couldn't have murdered that boy.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.334
Why not?

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:36.882
He saw me in the window
like we planned.

01:00:37.092 --> 01:00:39.969
Then he went in to the room
and saw the stuff.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:43.931
Then when he went looking for her,
I locked the attic door behind him.

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:45.516
He was trapped in there for hours

01:00:45.726 --> 01:00:48.269
while I took everything
down the back stairs.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:51.480
So, you see,
he couldn't have done it.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.692
What difference does it make?

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:57.903
We want him recommitted.
This would have done it.

01:00:58.113 --> 01:00:59.739
Mother, he's innocent.

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:01.532
Innocent?

01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:03.451
He killed your aunt, didn't he?

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.745
Not to mention the six other people.

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:08.456
Mother, that was 22 years ago.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:12.251
Mary, people don't change.

01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:14.545
He must have gotten out somehow.

01:01:14.755 --> 01:01:16.922
Mother, I was wrong.

01:01:17.132 --> 01:01:18.758
I don't think he drilled that hole
in the bathroom wall.

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:20.843
Of course he did.

01:01:21.053 --> 01:01:22.678
Mother, listen to me.

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:25.222
I think there's someone else
in the house.

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:26.349
Don't be stupid.

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:28.768
It's just Bates
up to his old tricks again.

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:30.269
It can't be Norman.

01:01:30.479 --> 01:01:32.355
He isn't like that anymore.

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:35.399
Maybe if you knew him now...

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:38.653
It's just that he's trying so very hard
to do what's right

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.321
to keep his sanity.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:43.741
And it hardly seems fair for us
to be doing what we're doing to him.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:46.285
You're as crazy as he is.

01:01:47.663 --> 01:01:49.497
We'll talk later.
Norman needs me.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.791
Norman needs you?

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.669
A psychopath needs you?

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:57.129
Look, go back to your hotel.
We'll talk later.

01:01:58.090 --> 01:01:59.840
He'll kill you.
You know that, don't you?

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:03.219
He'll murder you
just like he did all the others!

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:49.098
Mary!

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:53.853
My God, what happened?

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:55.271
I don't know.

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:04.113
Jesus.

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:06.365
How did that get in there?

01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:10.703
After I killed that kid in the cellar,
I used it to clean up the mess,

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:13.873
and then...
then I flushed it down there.

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:16.459
You didn't kill anybody.
You were locked in the attic.

01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:19.420
It wasn't locked.
You said so yourself.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.046
Norman,
stop talking nonsense.

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:22.923
I tell you,
you didn't kill anybody.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.425
Then, how do you explain this?

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:27.094
Well?!

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:28.888
I can't.

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:33.309
Did you clean up the cellar
the way you told the sheriff?

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:34.894
No.

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:36.645
Somebody did.

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:40.775
And with that towel
after they killed that kid.

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:42.985
Norman, it couldn't have been you.

01:03:43.195 --> 01:03:45.696
How can you be so sure?
Even I don't know.

01:03:45.906 --> 01:03:48.949
- I always used to black out when I...
- Because you couldn't.

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:52.620
You don't have it in you, not anymore.

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.042
Norman, look,
why don't you go downstairs

01:03:58.251 --> 01:03:59.376
and make us a drink, okay?

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:01.670
And I'll clean this up.

01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:41.377
Norman?

01:04:44.673 --> 01:04:45.881
Yes?

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:52.471
Uh... the teakettle's boiling.

01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:53.722
Oh.

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:55.140
Okay.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:29.753
What happened?

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:32.548
Up there.
I saw someone staring at me.

01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:35.509
There's no one there now.

01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:37.219
Someone was watching me
through that hole.

01:07:37.429 --> 01:07:38.721
They're in the house with us right now.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:40.014
Where did you get that thing?

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:42.558
I... I had it in my purse.
My mother gave it to me when I was...

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:44.018
Oh.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.687
Come on!

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:50.774
Uh... you take the downstairs,
I'll check up here.

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:52.192
Well, shouldn't we stick together?

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.236
Don't worry, I've got this.

01:07:57.365 --> 01:07:59.908
It's because of me, isn't it?
That's why you have it.

01:08:00.869 --> 01:08:02.411
Of course not.

01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:07.291
Hurry up.
They'll get away.

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:28.395
Mrs. Lila Loomis, room 15, please.

01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:33.317
You're sure she hasn't come back?

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:36.069
There'll be no message.
Thank you.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:39.281
Okay, Mother, where are you?

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.939
Norman.

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:30.791
What is it?

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.046
It's my mother.

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:40.300
She's downstairs.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:42.136
Did you see her?

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:46.348
You're sure you heard her?

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:48.433
Come on.

01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:49.685
No.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.854
She'll kill you.

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:54.815
I know she will.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.109
Norman, your mother's dead.

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:59.653
You killed her.
You told me so yourself.

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:01.989
I was wrong.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.949
She survived.

01:10:04.159 --> 01:10:05.701
And now...

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:08.203
she's downstairs...

01:10:08.413 --> 01:10:09.705
waiting for you.

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:11.748
Norman, it couldn't be your mother.

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:13.000
No.

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.377
No, it... it had to be someone else.

01:10:15.587 --> 01:10:18.297
Whoever it is
that's trying to drive you crazy again.

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:19.715
Yeah?

01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:21.049
Yes.

01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:23.552
- So, let's go downstairs and find...
- No!

01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:27.931
It's too dangerous.

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:30.642
Let's wait till morning.

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:32.686
What are we gonna do until then?

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:34.313
I'll protect you.

01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:37.316
You'll be okay.

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:40.152
I'll... I'll be fine right here.

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:48.118
It was always safe here... at night.

01:10:50.955 --> 01:10:53.415
- Norman, this is...
- No.

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:54.833
Okay.

01:10:55.043 --> 01:10:59.254
Um... we'll spend the night
in here.

01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:01.840
You can use the sleeping bag.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:54.476
What are you doing, Norman?

01:11:56.354 --> 01:11:59.564
Norman, put the knife down.
Nobody's gonna come in the door.

01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:01.858
- They're not, huh?
- No.

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.070
Okay.

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:10.117
Mary.

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:11.994
Yes?

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:16.790
I'm becoming... confused again,
aren't I?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.125
Of course not.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:19.543
Don't lie to me.

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:22.754
Not you.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:33.181
Yes, Norman,
you are becoming confused again.

01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:46.820
Just...

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:49.948
don't let them take me back
to the institution.

01:12:50.158 --> 01:12:51.616
All right?

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.798
Don't worry, Norman.
I won't.

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.761
You smell good.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:13.388
- I do?
- Yeah.

01:13:13.598 --> 01:13:15.891
What do I smell like?

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:20.062
You smell like...
like the toasted cheese sandwiches.

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:21.897
What?

01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:26.360
That my mother used to bring me
when I was in bed with a temperature.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:29.446
She used to do lots of nice things
for me before she went...

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:30.489
before she became...

01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:32.366
Shh.

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.493
Just remember the good things
she did for you.

01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:37.204
Only the good things.

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:39.247
I can't.
They're not there anymore.

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:41.917
Of course they're there.

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:44.753
No, the doctors took them all away.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:47.381
Along with everything else.

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:49.508
Except...

01:13:50.718 --> 01:13:52.219
Except those sandwiches.

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:54.638
Shh. Shh.

01:13:57.392 --> 01:14:00.519
- Just sleep, Norman.
- Okay.

01:14:01.479 --> 01:14:03.313
Just sleep.

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:22.249
- Oh, good morning, Doctor.
- Morning, Norman.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:23.125
I called your office,

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:25.168
and they said you were on your way
over here.

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:27.379
Where's Mary?

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:28.630
She's gone into town.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.132
Oh?

01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:31.800
What for?

01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:34.803
I don't know.
She didn't tell me.

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:36.430
Some tea?

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:39.182
Coffee if you have it.
Thank you.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:40.600
Sure.

01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:54.322
Norman...

01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:57.409
do you remember Lila Loomis?

01:14:58.578 --> 01:14:59.661
Yes.

01:14:59.871 --> 01:15:02.372
She's staying in town.

01:15:02.582 --> 01:15:03.957
She is?

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:11.506
She's Mary's mother.

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:15.469
That's why Mary went into town.
To see her.

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:23.101
Do you realize what this means,
Norman?

01:15:23.311 --> 01:15:24.519
What?

01:15:24.729 --> 01:15:26.813
They're the ones
who have been leaving the notes

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:29.357
and making the phone calls.

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:33.737
- Why would they do that?
- Because they hate you.

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:36.323
Mary? Mary doesn't hate me.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:38.074
Come on, Norman.

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:39.242
Like mother like daughter.

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:41.620
You know how Lila Loomis feels
about you.

01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:44.748
She can't wait to see you
re-institutionalized.

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:47.667
That's why all this
is happening to you.

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:51.755
They want to destabilize you,
undermine your sense of reality.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.257
They can't do that.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:57.302
Good.
Glad to hear you say that.

01:15:57.512 --> 01:15:59.596
But...

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:01.473
It isn't them, anyway.

01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:04.684
It isn't? Who is it?

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:10.732
It's my mother.

01:16:10.942 --> 01:16:14.486
She's not... dead.

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:20.367
How do you know that?

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:23.745
I've seen her up in the window.

01:16:23.955 --> 01:16:26.498
You saw her, too.

01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:32.087
That was Mary Loomis or Lila Loomis
dressed up to look like your mother.

01:16:32.296 --> 01:16:34.339
What about the phone calls?

01:16:34.549 --> 01:16:36.424
Mary Loomis again.

01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:39.636
But she's been with me
when the phone rang.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:42.305
Then, it was her mother.

01:16:53.568 --> 01:16:57.654
My mother spoke to me downstairs.

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:02.784
Norman...

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:08.331
Do you remember now
our discussions about your mother?

01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:11.710
Once you accepted the fact
that you murdered her,

01:17:11.919 --> 01:17:14.838
her memory would have no hold
over you.

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:24.848
Room 15, please.

01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:28.810
I want you to stop calling Norman.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:29.853
What are you doing here?

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:32.063
You heard me.
Stop calling Norman.

01:17:32.273 --> 01:17:33.189
I haven't called him.

01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:34.899
Don't lie to me!
You called him this morning!

01:17:35.109 --> 01:17:38.278
For God's sake,
keep your voice down.

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:44.576
All right,
so what if I did call him?

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:47.704
He's slipping into insanity again.
I can hear it in his voice.

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:50.832
There's nothing anyone can do
about it, not even you.

01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:53.376
You could stop stuffing bloody towels
down toilets

01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:54.711
and peering through peepholes
in walls.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.672
- That would be a help.
- What? What are you talking about?

01:17:57.882 --> 01:18:00.508
About what you're doing to Norman.
You were in that house last night.

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:03.011
I was not.
I came right back here after I saw you.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.929
Don't lie to me.

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:06.306
I'm not lying.

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:08.683
Then, why weren't you in your room
last night when I called?

01:18:08.893 --> 01:18:11.394
What, did you have me paged?
I was probably down here.

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:13.396
Mother, stop lying to me, please.

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:15.649
What happened in that house
last night?

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.067
Good-bye, Mother.

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:18.985
Hey!

01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:21.905
He's about to go over the edge,
isn't he?

01:18:22.114 --> 01:18:23.406
Listen. Now, listen.

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.617
Just dress up in his mother's clothes
one more time.

01:18:25.826 --> 01:18:26.868
That's all it's going to take.

01:18:27.078 --> 01:18:28.620
I'll have the police and a doctor
out there

01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:29.913
before you're in any danger.

01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:31.665
Then, they'll have to act
on our petition.

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:33.708
Mother, I signed all your petitions.

01:18:33.918 --> 01:18:34.959
I've been to all your meetings.

01:18:35.169 --> 01:18:37.003
I've done everything you've asked me
for years.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:39.381
But I am not going to hurt Norman
anymore.

01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:42.300
Well, if you won't do it for me,
at least do it for your father.

01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:44.177
I am not living for dead people
anymore, Mother.

01:18:44.387 --> 01:18:47.514
Not for your sister or my father.
Not even for you.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:50.475
- Now, I'm going.
- Now, wait a minute.

01:18:50.685 --> 01:18:52.268
Mother, let go.
You're hurting me.

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:53.645
Now, you listen to me, young lady.

01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:55.980
You're gonna see this through,
or I'm going to...

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:57.649
- Mom, don't.
- No.

01:18:57.858 --> 01:18:58.441
You can't make me...

01:19:02.029 --> 01:19:03.988
No, listen... Listen to me!

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:06.658
If you go near that house,
you're going to be sorry.

01:19:06.867 --> 01:19:07.826
What year is that?

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:08.827
Yeah.

01:19:09.036 --> 01:19:10.161
I don't see what all the rush was.

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:11.538
Well, the sheriff was concerned,

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.581
and he thought
we might bend the rules.

01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:14.666
Put that down real easy.

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:16.000
- I don't like it.
- Here?

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:18.294
Supposed to have an order
from the coroner.

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:20.797
- I got this.
- Well, you're not supposed to like it.

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:23.007
Sheriff said do it, so we're doing it.

01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:23.967
All right.

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:25.135
- Get that.
- I got it.

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:26.469
Yeah.

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:30.473
Ooh.

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:33.351
Hope we're not gonna be here long.

01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:35.687
Now do you believe me?

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:40.024
Yes. She's dead.

01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:44.195
And she's not coming back
to life again, is she?

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:47.490
Back to life?

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:51.745
No.

01:19:54.582 --> 01:19:57.041
Shall we go?

01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:15.059
Mary?

01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:17.270
Back here!

01:20:24.695 --> 01:20:26.946
I was just about to have some lunch.
You want some?

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:28.907
No.

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:31.034
Where have you been?

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:33.077
At the cemetery.

01:20:33.287 --> 01:20:35.747
Dr. Raymond had them open up
my mother's coffin.

01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:37.290
Oh?

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.875
Yeah, so...

01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:42.045
that proves that she's not the one
who's been torturing me.

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:45.632
Not unless... she's a ghost.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:47.592
No?

01:20:47.802 --> 01:20:52.222
No. He says...
he says it's you and your mother.

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:55.099
He says your last name is Loomis.

01:20:55.309 --> 01:20:57.435
Is that true, Mary?

01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:04.901
I wonder who that could be.

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:06.903
I don't know.

01:21:07.905 --> 01:21:09.656
Don't you?

01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:19.040
Hello, Mrs. Loomis.
How are you this af?

01:21:23.128 --> 01:21:24.587
I'm...

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:26.881
I'm sorry, Mother.

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:29.008
I didn't mean to insult you.

01:21:30.094 --> 01:21:33.179
Norman, stop it.
This is not your mother.

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:35.473
Hello. Hello, Lila?

01:21:35.683 --> 01:21:37.809
Lila, are you there?

01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:41.229
There's no one on the line.

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.022
Hello?

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:48.653
Yes, Mother,
I'm sorry we were interrupted.

01:21:48.863 --> 01:21:49.988
Norman, there's no one there.

01:21:50.197 --> 01:22:00.665
Yes, Mother.

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:03.209
Hello?

01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:05.879
Hello, Norman?
This is your mother.

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:06.963
It doesn't sound like her.

01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:09.215
It is, Norman,
and I want you to hang up.

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:10.967
Do you understand?

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:12.927
Hang up.

01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:15.513
All right.

01:22:15.723 --> 01:22:17.223
Do it, Norman, now.

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:20.602
Hang up.

01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:40.496
I was so worried.

01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:42.457
About what?

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:44.417
Well, that all the things
that have been happening to me

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:46.294
were because of you
and your mother.

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:48.546
And when Dr. Raymond
showed me Mrs. Bates' corpse,

01:22:48.756 --> 01:22:52.091
I knew she was dead for sure.

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:53.593
But now...

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:56.012
now I know it's somebody
completely different.

01:22:56.221 --> 01:22:57.180
Who is it?

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:01.434
My real mother.

01:23:01.644 --> 01:23:03.978
Who is your real mother, Norman?

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:07.899
I don't know.

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:09.192
She won't tell me.

01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:10.151
Your mother is dead.

01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:14.072
Mrs. Bates was your real mother,
and she's dead.

01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:16.074
Then, who was that on the phone?

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:19.744
My mother.

01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:24.290
Dr. Raymond was right
about both of us.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:28.753
Lila and I were trying
to drive you crazy again.

01:23:28.963 --> 01:23:29.837
But then I stopped.

01:23:30.047 --> 01:23:33.341
Only, she won't,
and she's the one who's calling.

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:44.102
Well... why did you stop?

01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:47.855
It wasn't fair for us to be doing
what we were doing to you.

01:23:48.065 --> 01:23:50.066
Is that the only reason?

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:51.401
What do you mean?

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:54.195
You know what I mean.

01:24:12.506 --> 01:24:13.923
Ma'am.

01:24:14.133 --> 01:24:18.970
Norman, the sheriff would like
to see you out at the swamp.

01:24:41.785 --> 01:24:44.203
- Hey, Sam?
- Yeah.

01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:46.622
Scotch it is.

01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:48.708
There you go.

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:31.918
All right, spread that line away.

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:34.337
We're gonna send the divers
down here in a minute.

01:25:34.546 --> 01:25:37.715
Everybody, uh, stay clear...

01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:41.761
We need more time to...

01:25:43.931 --> 01:25:45.848
- Hello, Norman.
- Hi, Sheriff.

01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:48.101
What's, uh, what's going on here?

01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:50.144
You ever seen this before?

01:25:50.354 --> 01:25:52.271
No. Did you...
Did you find it in the swamp?

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:54.524
Yes.

01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:56.692
How about any of this stuff?

01:25:57.736 --> 01:25:59.946
Well, thi... this is Mr. Toomey's.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:01.739
Who?

01:26:01.949 --> 01:26:04.742
Norman's motel manager...
before he fired him, that is.

01:26:04.952 --> 01:26:06.536
You seen him since?

01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:08.871
No, I told him to get packing,
and he left.

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:10.665
That's all I know.

01:26:10.874 --> 01:26:12.125
You sure?

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:13.793
Yeah.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.463
Well, that's about it, then.
You can leave.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.217
Just you, Norman,
not the young lady.

01:26:21.426 --> 01:26:22.802
Okay, but... but shouldn't I wait?

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:26.681
Don't worry.
I'll have her along presently.

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:28.474
Aw, forget the marker.
Get on in there.

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:31.561
Sheriff, I've been wanting
to talk to you.

01:26:32.312 --> 01:26:32.979
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:36.065
Someone has been phoning Norman
claiming to be his mother.

01:26:36.275 --> 01:26:38.943
And not the dead Mrs. Bates.
His real mother.

01:26:39.153 --> 01:26:41.195
So?

01:26:41.405 --> 01:26:45.700
So, I've been wondering if it's possible
that he was adopted?

01:26:46.285 --> 01:26:47.702
Not that I've ever heard of,

01:26:47.911 --> 01:26:51.497
and I've lived my entire life here,
Ms. Loomis.

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:54.667
How did you find out who I was?

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:59.172
We're a tad slow around here,
young lady, but not incompetent.

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:02.550
Now I've got a question for you.

01:27:02.759 --> 01:27:05.511
Either you or your mother
know anything about this?

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:07.013
No.

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:09.390
Then, I don't see any point
in either of you stayin' around Fairvale

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.641
any longer, do you?

01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:13.186
Have we broken some law?

01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:18.232
None that are on the books,

01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:20.651
but a whole hell of a lot of them
that aren't.

01:27:20.861 --> 01:27:23.487
Like all the ones
having to do with right or wrong.

01:27:23.697 --> 01:27:24.822
I'd say you and your mother

01:27:25.032 --> 01:27:27.825
have just about broken
every one of those, wouldn't you?

01:27:28.035 --> 01:27:29.327
I didn't mean to.

01:27:29.536 --> 01:27:31.454
Now, that's what Norman said
20 years ago.

01:27:31.663 --> 01:27:33.206
Only he was crazy.

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:34.749
Now, what's your excuse?

01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:38.878
I guess I don't have one.

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:41.464
Well, I'll just say good-bye
to you now, then.

01:27:41.673 --> 01:27:42.882
Expect it to be for the last time.

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:44.675
Sheriff.

01:27:44.885 --> 01:27:46.344
I said good-bye, Miss Loomis.

01:27:46.553 --> 01:27:48.095
Hey, Sheriff.

01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:49.472
There's a car down here.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:50.431
Anybody in it?

01:27:50.641 --> 01:27:52.016
I can't tell.
It's stuck in the mud.

01:27:52.226 --> 01:27:55.436
Well, get a winch line down to it
and get it out of there.

01:27:56.188 --> 01:27:58.189
All right, they found a car.

01:31:08.588 --> 01:31:10.756
Doctor.

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:13.008
What are you doing here?

01:31:15.387 --> 01:31:19.723
I followed Lila Loomis
from her hotel to your house.

01:31:19.933 --> 01:31:21.851
She came down here.

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.269
Oh.

01:31:24.938 --> 01:31:27.064
Where is she?

01:31:27.274 --> 01:31:28.691
I don't know.

01:31:30.652 --> 01:31:33.112
But she was here.

01:31:36.158 --> 01:31:38.993
It proves she was the one
that was dressing up as your mother.

01:31:39.202 --> 01:31:40.995
How?

01:31:42.873 --> 01:31:46.625
Well, if she wasn't gonna do it again,
why would she sneak into your house?

01:31:46.835 --> 01:31:48.669
But she wasn't the woman
I saw in the window.

01:31:48.879 --> 01:31:50.337
She wasn't?

01:31:50.547 --> 01:31:53.007
- No.
- Then, who was?

01:31:53.216 --> 01:31:54.550
That was my mother.

01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:58.095
Norman, your mother is dead.

01:31:58.513 --> 01:32:00.764
Remember the open coffin?

01:32:00.974 --> 01:32:02.975
Mrs. Bates only took care of me.

01:32:03.185 --> 01:32:07.688
My real mother
is somebody completely different.

01:32:08.899 --> 01:32:10.357
How do you know this, Norman?

01:32:10.567 --> 01:32:12.735
She told me.
On the phone.

01:32:15.405 --> 01:32:16.489
Norman, I've already proved to you

01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:19.575
that Mary and Lila Loomis
were the ones who were calling you.

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:21.660
Would you accept the fact

01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:25.414
that you have no other mother
than Mrs. Bates?

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:28.584
Of course.

01:32:28.793 --> 01:32:30.127
Then, that's what I'll do.

01:32:35.509 --> 01:32:37.760
It would be a great load off my mind.

01:32:42.182 --> 01:32:45.226
Okay, everybody stand back.

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:47.436
That's it.

01:32:48.563 --> 01:32:49.313
Keep it comin'.

01:32:51.650 --> 01:32:53.609
Looks like Toomey's car, doesn't it?

01:32:53.818 --> 01:32:55.694
That's it, a little more.

01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:58.197
We'll check inside
before we open the trunk.

01:32:58.406 --> 01:32:59.782
All right.

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:01.158
That's it.

01:33:01.368 --> 01:33:02.660
Do you recognize it?

01:33:02.869 --> 01:33:04.370
Okay, hold it right there.

01:33:04.579 --> 01:33:05.913
Well?

01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:10.793
Sheriff, it's empty.

01:33:12.754 --> 01:33:15.506
Don't you have someplace else to be?

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:18.968
Open the trunk.

01:33:21.304 --> 01:33:23.180
Watch out, Mike.

01:33:24.266 --> 01:33:26.100
Jeez!

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:39.071
Norman?

01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:40.322
- Norman.
- What is it?

01:33:40.532 --> 01:33:42.199
They found a car in the swamp.

01:33:42.409 --> 01:33:43.492
- Who?
- I don't know whose.

01:33:43.702 --> 01:33:45.703
They just found a car.
That's all. Isn't that enough?

01:33:45.912 --> 01:33:47.037
- For what?
- For them to arrest you!

01:33:47.247 --> 01:33:48.372
I'll get your jacket.

01:33:48.582 --> 01:33:51.250
- Come on. We're getting out of here.
- How?

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:54.461
I don't know.
We'll hitch a ride until we get a car.

01:33:54.671 --> 01:33:55.713
Where would we go?

01:33:55.922 --> 01:33:58.924
Somewhere, anywhere, Norman.
Please hurry.

01:33:59.134 --> 01:34:01.176
They'd catch us.

01:34:02.387 --> 01:34:05.306
- Yeah, you're right.
- So, what's the point of going?

01:34:05.515 --> 01:34:07.933
Because it's my fault.

01:34:08.935 --> 01:34:12.146
If my mother and I had left you alone,
you would've been fine.

01:34:12.355 --> 01:34:14.648
Nobody would be dead, and I'd just be
another dumb psych student

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:16.442
with nothing on her mind
but having a good time.

01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:18.319
It's not your fault.

01:34:18.528 --> 01:34:20.029
Then, whose fault is it?

01:34:20.238 --> 01:34:21.572
My mother's.

01:34:21.781 --> 01:34:23.741
She's the one who's been doing
the killing, to protect me.

01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:24.992
She told me so herself.

01:34:25.201 --> 01:34:27.703
Oh, Norman.

01:34:27.912 --> 01:34:31.957
You're mad, don't you know that?
You're mad as a hatter.

01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:35.336
Should I answer it?

01:34:35.545 --> 01:34:36.837
Why bother?

01:34:37.047 --> 01:34:39.715
It's only my mother.
Poor thing.

01:34:39.924 --> 01:34:40.716
She shouldn't be calling.

01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:43.844
She should be sitting back
and gloating.

01:34:44.054 --> 01:34:46.221
I better answer it.

01:34:54.564 --> 01:34:55.773
Hello?

01:34:55.982 --> 01:34:57.232
Norman, this is Dr. Raymond.

01:34:57.442 --> 01:34:59.693
I just found Lila Loomis' car
parked down the road.

01:34:59.903 --> 01:35:01.862
I'm calling you from the motel parlor.

01:35:02.072 --> 01:35:04.740
The calls that you've been receiving
from your fictitious mother

01:35:04.949 --> 01:35:06.367
have been placed right here.

01:35:06.576 --> 01:35:09.244
Lila Loomis has used this phone
to call your house.

01:35:09.454 --> 01:35:11.080
Yes, I...

01:35:12.248 --> 01:35:14.041
I understand...

01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:15.292
Mother.

01:35:15.502 --> 01:35:18.337
Norman, this is Dr. Raymond.

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:21.632
I've been waiting for your call, Mother.

01:35:25.345 --> 01:35:27.137
Hello, Lila?

01:35:27.347 --> 01:35:28.806
Li...

01:35:31.601 --> 01:35:33.644
She's hung up.

01:35:41.528 --> 01:35:43.987
No, Mother, Mary's still here with me.

01:35:44.197 --> 01:35:46.365
I like her.

01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:48.701
No.

01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:51.912
No, of course not.
Not as much as you.

01:35:55.208 --> 01:35:57.251
No, I...

01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:00.170
I won't do that.

01:36:00.839 --> 01:36:03.048
You can't make me...

01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:07.428
kill her.

01:36:07.637 --> 01:36:11.849
Do I have to, Mother?

01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:15.018
But why?
Why do I have to kill her?

01:36:50.054 --> 01:36:52.222
Oh, no, Mother, please.

01:36:52.432 --> 01:36:54.141
Please don't make me.

01:36:55.185 --> 01:36:59.563
Oh, Mother, how can you
even think such a thing?

01:36:59.773 --> 01:37:02.900
I could never do anything like that.

01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:06.403
I don't think you understand
about Mary, Mother.

01:37:06.613 --> 01:37:09.490
She's really very kind.

01:37:09.991 --> 01:37:10.949
I trust her.

01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:12.701
She would never do anything
to hurt me.

01:37:12.911 --> 01:37:14.495
Norman?

01:37:14.704 --> 01:37:16.663
Norman.

01:37:16.873 --> 01:37:20.459
Do you recognize me?
It's me, your mother.

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:21.418
Yes, Mother.

01:37:21.628 --> 01:37:23.045
And since I'm standing here
in front of you,

01:37:23.254 --> 01:37:26.507
I can't very well be on the phone,
can I?

01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:30.719
So, hang up the phone, Norman.
Hang up.

01:37:30.929 --> 01:37:32.971
Yes, Mother.

01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:36.850
Norman, put the phone down
this instant!

01:37:44.484 --> 01:37:47.236
Norman, this is your mother.

01:37:47.821 --> 01:37:49.404
Norman, can you hear me?

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.201
Norman?

01:37:56.079 --> 01:37:57.996
Norman, are you there?

01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:08.090
Norman, please say something.

01:38:12.595 --> 01:38:14.721
Norman.

01:38:17.308 --> 01:38:18.934
Norman!

01:38:19.143 --> 01:38:20.143
Got you!

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:42.457
Norman, I...

01:38:43.793 --> 01:38:44.960
I didn't mean to do it.

01:38:45.169 --> 01:38:46.753
I... I...

01:38:46.963 --> 01:38:48.839
I thought he was you.

01:38:49.048 --> 01:38:50.632
It's all right, Mother.

01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:52.217
Norman, I'm not your mother.

01:38:53.177 --> 01:38:54.261
It's all right.

01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:56.597
Norman, I am not your mother!
I am Mary!

01:38:56.806 --> 01:38:58.056
How many times
have you killed, Mother,

01:38:58.266 --> 01:38:59.057
and how many times have I...

01:38:59.267 --> 01:39:01.643
Norman, look.
I am Mary!

01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:03.604
And they're gonna come for you,
Mother, just like they did before.

01:39:03.813 --> 01:39:05.439
Stay away from me!

01:39:09.569 --> 01:39:11.320
And I'll cover up for you.

01:39:11.529 --> 01:39:12.654
- Now, give me the knife.
- Stay away!

01:39:13.448 --> 01:39:15.699
I always have
because I'm your dutiful son.

01:39:15.909 --> 01:39:16.950
Stay away!

01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:19.494
And you're my loving mother.

01:39:19.704 --> 01:39:21.705
So, please give me the knife.

01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:27.294
Time to go to the fruit cellar now,
Mother.

01:39:27.503 --> 01:39:29.212
Norman, stay away.

01:39:29.422 --> 01:39:32.007
Mother... I don't want...

01:39:34.093 --> 01:39:35.844
Norman, now, look.

01:39:36.054 --> 01:39:37.888
I don't want to hurt you, Mother.

01:39:38.097 --> 01:39:39.765
You're coming.

01:39:42.518 --> 01:39:44.436
In there, Mother. Hurry.

01:39:44.646 --> 01:39:45.979
Norman, please stop.

01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:47.940
You... You need help.
You're losing blood.

01:40:05.625 --> 01:40:07.125
You did it.

01:40:10.254 --> 01:40:11.630
They're here.

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:12.589
Let me help you.

01:40:12.799 --> 01:40:14.424
You killed them all!

01:40:14.634 --> 01:40:15.300
Freeze!

01:40:22.392 --> 01:40:25.060
The county sheriff and DA
have come down from Bakersfield

01:40:25.269 --> 01:40:27.104
to confer with Sheriff Hunt.

01:40:27.313 --> 01:40:28.563
Is that loud enough, guys?

01:40:28.773 --> 01:40:30.315
Yeah, that... that's, uh, good, honey.

01:40:30.525 --> 01:40:31.233
Uh, move over to your left,

01:40:31.442 --> 01:40:33.652
and I'll get City Hall
in the background.

01:40:34.612 --> 01:40:37.614
Okay, we'll go in five, four...

01:40:37.824 --> 01:40:38.699
Wait a minute. Hey!

01:40:38.908 --> 01:40:40.200
...three...

01:40:49.585 --> 01:40:50.627
All right, let's go. Go on.

01:40:50.837 --> 01:40:52.212
- Can you get it?
- That's fine. Get out of here.

01:40:52.422 --> 01:40:53.130
You want to read through this

01:40:53.339 --> 01:40:54.548
and make sure
it's exactly what you said?

01:40:54.757 --> 01:40:56.967
Can I get you anything?

01:40:57.176 --> 01:40:58.927
Yeah, that's...
No, wait a minute.

01:40:59.137 --> 01:40:59.803
She didn't say that.

01:41:00.013 --> 01:41:02.389
She said if she didn't stay away,
she'd be sorry... sorry.

01:41:02.598 --> 01:41:03.682
- Not that she'd kill him?
- No.

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:05.475
- Hey, could I get a cup of coffee?
- Yeah, in a minute. Just a minute.

01:41:05.685 --> 01:41:06.727
Everybody's getting coffee
around here.

01:41:06.936 --> 01:41:09.271
We broke in the door.

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:15.444
At this point, I observed the suspect,
uh, wielding a big knife on the victim.

01:41:15.653 --> 01:41:18.363
I drew my service revolver and shot...

01:41:19.574 --> 01:41:20.323
So, she and her mother

01:41:20.533 --> 01:41:23.035
were trying to put Norman
back into the asylum.

01:41:23.244 --> 01:41:25.412
Well, that much we know for sure.

01:41:25.621 --> 01:41:27.873
Then somethin' went wrong
between 'em.

01:41:28.082 --> 01:41:30.125
- What?
- They had a fight.

01:41:30.334 --> 01:41:31.668
She wanted Lila
to leave Norman alone,

01:41:31.878 --> 01:41:33.378
but she wouldn't.

01:41:33.588 --> 01:41:35.505
We have a witness
that heard the whole thing.

01:41:35.715 --> 01:41:38.133
So, she murdered her own mother
over Norman?

01:41:38.342 --> 01:41:40.093
Looks like it.

01:41:40.303 --> 01:41:41.219
What about the bodies
in the swamp?

01:41:41.429 --> 01:41:43.096
The boy and that motel manager.

01:41:43.306 --> 01:41:45.140
Mary and Lila Loomis did it.

01:41:45.349 --> 01:41:46.808
They tried to blame the murders
on Norman.

01:41:47.018 --> 01:41:49.561
Or maybe only the daughter did it.

01:41:50.646 --> 01:41:52.898
She definitely killed Dr. Raymond.

01:41:53.107 --> 01:41:54.941
I'll tell you, If you'd seen Mary Loomis
at the end,

01:41:55.151 --> 01:41:56.234
you wouldn't have questioned it.

01:41:56.444 --> 01:41:57.861
She'd gone mad.

01:41:58.071 --> 01:42:00.739
Dressed up in Norman's mother's
clothes and a wig.

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:01.782
Trying to kill Norman,

01:42:01.991 --> 01:42:04.868
and him hardly even able to
defend himself any longer.

01:42:05.078 --> 01:42:08.830
Right till the end, she kept saying
Norman was the one who was crazy.

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.165
It was horrible.

01:42:19.842 --> 01:42:22.552
What about it, Norman?
You ready to go home?

01:42:23.387 --> 01:42:26.139
It'll all be in my report tomorrow,
gentlemen.

01:42:32.063 --> 01:42:33.939
Uh, let's go out the back.

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.319
Someone's got to do something
about this pursuit.

01:45:15.559 --> 01:45:16.851
Mrs. Spool.

01:45:17.061 --> 01:45:19.479
- Hello, Norman.
- Come in.

01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:24.567
I was just having some supper.

01:45:24.777 --> 01:45:26.778
Nothing much,
but would you like to share

01:45:26.988 --> 01:45:28.822
my toasted cheese sandwich?

01:45:29.031 --> 01:45:31.032
Oh, no, thank you.

01:45:35.788 --> 01:45:38.373
It's, uh, Ms. Spool, actually.

01:45:38.582 --> 01:45:39.791
Oh.

01:45:41.752 --> 01:45:43.753
You were expecting me.

01:45:43.963 --> 01:45:46.381
Well, I was...
I was expecting someone.

01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:49.134
I just wasn't sure when.

01:45:50.094 --> 01:45:52.345
- Tea?
- Oh, please.

01:46:04.608 --> 01:46:05.650
Milk and sugar?

01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:08.069
That would be nice.

01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:10.572
So...

01:46:10.781 --> 01:46:12.157
are you really my mother?

01:46:13.659 --> 01:46:16.077
The name Spool
doesn't mean anything to you?

01:46:16.287 --> 01:46:17.746
No. Should it?

01:46:17.955 --> 01:46:19.748
It was Norma Bates' maiden name.

01:46:19.957 --> 01:46:22.417
The woman you thought
was your mother was my sister.

01:46:23.627 --> 01:46:28.048
I had you when I was very young
out of wedlock.

01:46:28.257 --> 01:46:33.094
I couldn't handle a brand-new baby,
especially being by myself.

01:46:33.304 --> 01:46:34.304
I...

01:46:35.431 --> 01:46:38.767
I had some trouble,
and the state put me away for a while.

01:46:40.269 --> 01:46:42.604
That's when Norma took you in.

01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:45.315
You were less than a year old.

01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:48.651
Too young to remember me.

01:46:49.403 --> 01:46:51.529
She never mentioned me, did she?

01:46:51.739 --> 01:46:55.742
No, she, uh... she didn't.

01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:57.452
I guess she didn't want you to know

01:46:57.661 --> 01:47:02.499
you had a mother
who wasn't quite... right.

01:47:04.794 --> 01:47:09.130
But... we know all about that,
don't we, Norman?

01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:10.715
Mm-hmm.

01:47:10.925 --> 01:47:11.549
After I got out,

01:47:11.759 --> 01:47:14.469
you'd already had your troubles
and been committed.

01:47:14.678 --> 01:47:17.097
I decided to wait for you.

01:47:17.306 --> 01:47:18.098
And then when I saw

01:47:18.307 --> 01:47:20.058
what they were trying to do
to my poor little boy,

01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:22.143
I couldn't stand it.

01:47:22.353 --> 01:47:24.521
So I followed them.

01:47:25.147 --> 01:47:27.107
And one by one...

01:47:28.317 --> 01:47:30.360
After all...

01:47:30.569 --> 01:47:32.612
you're all I have in this world.

01:47:45.251 --> 01:47:47.836
You're sure you won't have
a sandwich?

01:47:49.171 --> 01:47:50.422
Pardon?

01:48:37.344 --> 01:48:38.761
I know how it is, Mother.

01:48:38.971 --> 01:48:41.806
You've had a long day,
and you must be tired.

01:48:42.016 --> 01:48:44.934
I'll just put you to bed
and tuck you in for the night.

01:48:45.144 --> 01:48:47.395
I'll even say your prayers for you.

01:48:47.605 --> 01:48:49.397
Would you like that?

01:48:54.778 --> 01:48:57.280
I'm not sleepy.

01:48:57.490 --> 01:48:59.616
Put me in my chair.

01:48:59.825 --> 01:49:01.284
Yes, Mother.

01:49:01.494 --> 01:49:03.661
Now... turn me to the window.

01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:06.581
I want to keep my eyes on you,

01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:11.503
make sure you don't start playing
with filthy girls again.

01:49:11.712 --> 01:49:12.420
Yes, Mother.

01:49:12.630 --> 01:49:13.796
Good.

01:49:14.924 --> 01:49:17.217
Well, what are you gawking at?

01:49:17.426 --> 01:49:19.302
Go downstairs and open the motel.

01:49:19.512 --> 01:49:21.638
What do you expect us to live on?
Hope?

01:49:21.847 --> 01:49:23.264
No, Mother.

01:49:23.474 --> 01:49:27.602
Remember, Norman,
I'm the only who loves you.

01:49:27.811 --> 01:49:32.273
Only your mother truly loves you.
