You know that
feeling you get when you look down

00:29.661 --> 00:32.293
at the pool and you start to
inch your way in.

00:32.692 --> 00:36.027
Waiting because you don't want
to feel the water.

00:36.029 --> 00:38.262
My mom used to tell us you're
supposed to feel stuff.

00:38.264 --> 00:40.998
So don't cheat yourself out of a
great moment.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.102
You can spend you whole life
waiting with your toes in the water.

00:44.105 --> 00:45.872
Or you could just dive in.

00:52.445 --> 00:55.179
She could always
make an adventure out of anything

00:55.181 --> 00:57.683
And her voice echoes to us
everyday.

00:59.186 --> 01:00.452
That's my brother,

01:00.454 --> 01:02.287
Our parents promised us that on
their

01:02.289 --> 01:04.456
fifteenth wedding anniversary
they'd take us

01:04.458 --> 01:07.025
to the island where they got
married.

01:07.027 --> 01:08.793
We knew the island would be fun,

01:08.795 --> 01:10.861
but we never knew we'd meet a
special friend

01:10.863 --> 01:13.165
that would change our lives
forever.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.100
Our buddy Echo!

01:18.872 --> 01:20.038
The Dolphin.

03:11.815 --> 03:14.351
Bro bro bro, did you see that
cannonball?!

03:15.052 --> 03:18.989
It's spring break! Mom would
have wanted you to have fun.

03:22.892 --> 03:24.328
Do you want to jump in?

03:28.065 --> 03:30.231
Fine, we won't go on the deep
side.

03:30.233 --> 03:31.969
It's the same difference.

03:32.902 --> 03:33.904
Luke!

03:34.270 --> 03:35.838
It's been years

03:36.040 --> 03:38.475
Please don't let another summer
go by.

03:38.975 --> 03:40.541
You don't have to be afraid!

03:40.543 --> 03:41.545
I'm not afraid.

03:43.179 --> 03:45.915
- It's just I don't know what the big deal is anywa...
- Yeah swimming is fun but...

03:46.884 --> 03:48.518
with... without you

03:49.117 --> 03:50.119
it's not.

03:52.088 --> 03:53.054
Hey Skylar!

03:53.056 --> 03:54.826
- Let's go to practice!
- Come on!

03:55.624 --> 03:56.827
Got to go bro.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.327
You're missing out.

03:59.528 --> 04:00.797
Hey Sky!

04:01.164 --> 04:03.163
Why doesn't your brother swim
anymore?

04:03.165 --> 04:06.067
Yeah, is there something
wrong with him or what?

04:06.069 --> 04:07.501
Is he ever going to come back?

04:07.503 --> 04:09.907
He will when he's ready!

04:16.612 --> 04:17.846
Hunter!

04:18.380 --> 04:19.849
Hey Clint!

04:20.482 --> 04:23.151

04:24.253 --> 04:25.653

- Good to see you.

04:32.426 --> 04:34.294

04:34.296 --> 04:38.302

So I want to get a routine
for her while we're out there.

04:45.373 --> 04:46.609
I'm good with that.

04:47.376 --> 04:49.879
- Twice a day though.
- Twice a day!?

04:50.212 --> 04:52.445
- That means I gotta get up twice a day.
- Hey dad!

04:52.447 --> 04:53.583
Hey baby!

04:53.981 --> 04:55.915

island?

04:55.917 --> 04:58.652
Nope we have to do our own hunting.
You ready to go hunting?

04:58.654 --> 04:59.455
No.

05:00.154 --> 05:02.353
Alright get back in the pool.

05:02.355 --> 05:04.056
Hey! Uh uh!

05:04.058 --> 05:05.928
Hey! Whoa! Water bug!

05:07.162 --> 05:08.164

05:09.464 --> 05:12.100
- I'm a cannonball that's what I do!
- Taino Island...

05:13.135 --> 05:14.534

07:36.773 --> 07:37.775
Uh!

07:38.341 --> 07:39.343
What?!

07:40.511 --> 07:44.017
- Cutting out the middle man.
- By blowing up the boat?

07:47.785 --> 07:51.124
Oh lord am I going crazy,

08:02.533 --> 08:03.535
This is heaven!

08:04.735 --> 08:05.737
Wooo!

08:06.304 --> 08:07.304
Yes it is.

08:11.109 --> 08:13.875
Alright guys, I gotta go find
the boat rental company, OK?

08:13.877 --> 08:15.609
So you guys can look around a
little bit.

08:15.611 --> 08:16.710
But don't go far.

08:16.712 --> 08:18.315

- Yes! Now, let's go shopping.

08:56.486 --> 08:59.255
Whoa! Watch yourself little man.

09:09.597 --> 09:11.767
<i>You don't have to be afraid.</i>

09:40.196 --> 09:42.764
<i>Yeah swimming is fun but...</i>

09:43.365 --> 09:45.301
<i>Without you it's not.</i>

10:36.316 --> 10:37.852
Hey buddy. Come here.

10:53.767 --> 10:54.768
Hi sweetie.

10:55.903 --> 10:58.772

- Oh no my father sent me to...

10:59.305 --> 11:01.209

- Oh.

11:01.874 --> 11:05.510

- Whoops I gotta go!

11:19.493 --> 11:20.493
Hey buddy.

11:21.862 --> 11:23.497
Come here, come closer.

11:24.531 --> 11:25.766
Oh. My. Gosh!

11:27.566 --> 11:29.034
It's a dolphin.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.603
Aw, so cute!

11:31.470 --> 11:33.239
Come here. Come here! Come here!

11:33.640 --> 11:35.276
Where did he come from?

11:35.875 --> 11:38.679
I don't know
I guess he found us.

11:39.478 --> 11:42.348
- I think he wants to play fetch.
- I doubt that.

11:45.751 --> 11:47.621
Dude it's not a dog.

11:47.887 --> 11:49.823
So let's teach him!

11:53.659 --> 11:56.763
OK, so I take it from
you and then I throw it!

11:58.431 --> 11:59.432
Ready?

12:04.337 --> 12:05.505
Now you go get it.

12:06.604 --> 12:07.606
Grab it!

12:10.041 --> 12:12.878
Come on dogs and people do this
all of the time.

12:13.078 --> 12:14.580
It's fun just try it.

12:19.418 --> 12:21.383
Whoa what?

12:21.385 --> 12:23.890
- I call next!
- He's got it, he's doing it.

12:26.390 --> 12:28.560
Come here, come here.
This is so cool!

12:29.126 --> 12:31.994
Oh my gosh can we take him home.
He can even fit in our pool!

12:31.996 --> 12:34.033
- Woo-Hoo!
- Maybe even our bath tub.

12:34.698 --> 12:38.667
- Ah yes! Come on, come on.
- I want to take him home!

12:38.669 --> 12:40.004
You need to come with
us.

12:40.006 --> 12:42.604
- Ah that is awesome!
- You want to come with us?

12:42.606 --> 12:44.677
You want to come with us?

12:48.078 --> 12:50.646

- Want to come with us?

12:50.648 --> 12:53.619
- Yeah follow us!
- Let's go show dad!

13:02.793 --> 13:03.795
Wow!

13:08.766 --> 13:10.600
Hello down there!

13:15.172 --> 13:17.638
- Can we just move here?
- It's gorgeous isn't it?

13:17.640 --> 13:18.642
Awesome!

13:19.144 --> 13:20.610
Go find you rooms!

13:22.111 --> 13:23.714
Found my room!

13:26.582 --> 13:27.818
Punch it!

13:29.053 --> 13:32.123
No, not yet we're not
in open water yet sweetie!

13:35.057 --> 13:36.958
Along with everything else the
first

13:36.960 --> 13:40.732
thing you put on is a life vest
when you get in a boat.

13:41.498 --> 13:43.131
These decks are slippery on a
boat.

13:43.133 --> 13:44.598
You slip and hit your head and
go over.

13:44.600 --> 13:48.170
I don't care how strong a swimmer
you are you're not going to do well.

13:48.172 --> 13:49.469
Check!

13:49.472 --> 13:51.374
What do we do next?

13:52.709 --> 13:53.711
Luke!

13:57.514 --> 13:58.515
Luke?

13:58.915 --> 13:59.916
Gas!

14:00.517 --> 14:01.619
Gas is not bad.

14:03.118 --> 14:05.752
Gotta make sure the boat's not
taking on water first.

14:05.754 --> 14:07.824
Looks like it's floating to me.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.857
Yeah she's floating sweetie.

14:09.859 --> 14:11.162
But there's a plug in the back.

14:11.594 --> 14:13.693
Gotta make sure it's in all the
way.

14:13.695 --> 14:14.965
Then you check fuel.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.870
Then last, we check for flares
and paddles.

14:22.003 --> 14:23.005
Check!

14:23.772 --> 14:25.475
Now can we go?

14:25.907 --> 14:28.177
Not yet sweetie we need open
water.

14:32.849 --> 14:35.484
Alright we got open water,
everybody holding on?

14:35.685 --> 14:36.550
Sit down!

14:36.552 --> 14:38.618
- Yes sir!
- Yup I'm good!

14:38.620 --> 14:40.621
Alright Sky,
you can go ahead and say it now.

14:40.623 --> 14:41.624
Punch it!

14:54.603 --> 14:55.603
Whoa!

14:56.738 --> 14:57.739
Whoa!

14:59.241 --> 15:00.543
That boy is fast!

15:09.117 --> 15:12.184
Just in time to do
absolutely nothing thank you!

15:12.186 --> 15:14.821
- I was working...
- Working lion research.

15:14.823 --> 15:17.827
- Lion, lion research. All the lions of the ocean.
- Lion research.

15:18.593 --> 15:20.628
Think you'll get this
guy here.

15:21.729 --> 15:23.598
Uh, ok so here's the deal

15:23.832 --> 15:25.998
pretty sure this dude is like a
trained MMA fighter,

15:26.000 --> 15:27.001
so let's be chill.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.568
Uh ok tough
guys we're all going.

15:29.570 --> 15:30.940
Hey brother what's up?

15:31.639 --> 15:34.139
- How you doing?
- Hey man you TUCC'd?

15:34.141 --> 15:35.543
Excuse me?

15:35.910 --> 15:36.777
We're T-U-C-C.

15:36.779 --> 15:38.943
Taino underwater clean up
committee.

15:38.945 --> 15:39.813
Oh?

15:39.815 --> 15:41.246
Yeah we're giving out
complimentary

15:41.248 --> 15:42.748
mugs so we can have a litter
free island.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.720
The metal is so much better for
the island.

15:44.952 --> 15:47.119
We find those cups all
over the beach underwater,

15:47.121 --> 15:49.787
- that we clean up so...
- I appreciate it thank y'all.

15:49.789 --> 15:51.189
Anything to keep the beaches
clean.

15:51.191 --> 15:52.558
Thank you.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.692
But, uh, I don't remember
this last time I was out here.

15:54.694 --> 15:55.827
Oh you've been here before?

15:55.829 --> 15:57.162
Yeah, it's been a while
honeymoon.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.996
Would your wife like one too?

15:58.998 --> 16:01.667
It's just me and the kids this
time.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.336
Well, uh, hey you're doing it wrong
if you only chill at this resort.

16:04.338 --> 16:07.972
- I mean I know it's cool but...
- You gotta venture out see the real Taino!

16:07.974 --> 16:09.807
We would love too, the
resort doesn't tell

16:09.809 --> 16:11.710
you about any of the
external life going on.

16:11.712 --> 16:13.979
They want to keep you here
drinking the ten dollar lemonades.

16:13.981 --> 16:14.982
Ten dollars!

16:15.916 --> 16:17.715
I'm telling you man, you got
ripped off.

16:18.986 --> 16:20.685
I believe you.

16:20.687 --> 16:22.686
- Hey guys, see you at Outriggers tonight?
- Oh yeah!

16:22.688 --> 16:24.321
- Yeah man Outriggers for sure.
- Of course!

16:24.323 --> 16:27.325
Outriggers, you would get that
much cheaper and much better.

16:27.327 --> 16:29.293
It has the best switcha on the
island man.

16:29.295 --> 16:30.394
Switcha? What's that?

16:30.396 --> 16:32.864
Lemonade man, that's what we
call lemonade over here.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.765
- Taino lemonade.
- Is it kid friendly?

16:34.767 --> 16:36.099
Oh yeah for sure. of course.

16:36.101 --> 16:38.168

16:38.170 --> 16:40.674
- It's Taino time, bro.
- It's Taino time, baby.

16:41.674 --> 16:44.208
- I appreciate you.
- It was nice meeting you.

16:44.210 --> 16:47.078
- Good to meet y'all.
- We'll see you later, hopefully.

17:01.059 --> 17:01.861

17:02.928 --> 17:05.031

17:05.330 --> 17:06.832
Yeah I can feel it.

17:16.675 --> 17:18.308

18:21.406 --> 18:23.004
Ten dollar lemonades!

18:23.006 --> 18:25.174
Hey, what's going on my

18:25.176 --> 18:27.108

18:29.714 --> 18:30.882
- Welcome!
- Yeah man!

18:31.115 --> 18:32.916
- What's your name big man?
- Luke.

18:33.184 --> 18:34.853
- Luke.
- I'm Skylar.

18:35.086 --> 18:37.251
- Sky for the cool kids.
- Ooh man!

18:37.253 --> 18:38.254
Am I cool kid?

18:38.888 --> 18:39.890
Mmm, we'll see.

18:40.157 --> 18:41.258
Alright, alright.

18:42.493 --> 18:43.591
You gotta get some conch now,
you're on Taino Island man.

18:43.593 --> 18:45.860
- Oh yes!
- You gotta get some conch fritters

18:45.862 --> 18:48.032
- Conch salad, conch something.
- Conch taco.

18:48.331 --> 18:51.332
- We have everything but conch tacos.
- Nah man.

18:51.334 --> 18:53.269
Those aren't a thing even
though they should be.

18:53.936 --> 18:56.238
I, uh, moved here for my
master's

18:56.240 --> 18:58.072
and just been throwing conch
into

18:58.074 --> 19:00.407
every ramen recipe like
three times a day.

19:00.409 --> 19:03.444
- It's really gross.
- It's actually not it's amazing.

19:03.446 --> 19:04.915
Don't listen to her.

19:05.315 --> 19:07.013
So you guys are here for school.

19:07.015 --> 19:09.383
Yeah we're studying marine
biology.

19:09.385 --> 19:10.386
What is that?

19:10.820 --> 19:12.255
It's the study of sea animals.

19:12.789 --> 19:15.759
- Cool.
- What do you feed dolphins?

19:17.127 --> 19:20.094
Uh, we don't we let the dolphins
just

19:20.096 --> 19:21.865
chase little fish in the ocean.

19:22.232 --> 19:24.734
It's really important that we
don't feed the dolphins.

19:25.001 --> 19:27.868
They will grow to expect that
people need to feed them.

19:27.870 --> 19:30.371
And they need to depend on each
other

19:30.373 --> 19:31.842
to hunt as a pod.

19:33.175 --> 19:35.508
You hear that, and they're
dangerous.

19:35.510 --> 19:38.346
Nah man, they're the most
peaceful creatures in the sea.

19:38.348 --> 19:40.313
Nice, loving creatures man nah.

19:40.315 --> 19:43.454
- Humans are far worse.
- Oh in every way...

19:44.119 --> 19:45.818
humanly possible.

19:45.821 --> 19:47.723
What if one came here alone?

19:47.924 --> 19:52.161
- They rarely separate from the pod...
- Yeah it's not really common.

19:52.795 --> 19:54.997
Wait, what's going on? What's
happening?

19:56.866 --> 19:57.867
Let's say...

19:59.167 --> 20:01.868
We... might... know...

20:01.870 --> 20:02.872
someone...

20:03.838 --> 20:04.840
who...

20:05.907 --> 20:07.342
May have met a dolphin.

20:07.877 --> 20:09.145
By itself.

20:09.912 --> 20:11.380
A dolphin approached you guys?

20:11.579 --> 20:12.781
On Taino beach?

20:13.882 --> 20:14.883
Is that bad?

20:15.416 --> 20:16.418
He likes us.

20:17.152 --> 20:18.852
He must be separated.

20:18.854 --> 20:21.824
Sure you all didn't just see a
big ol' manatee or something?

20:22.057 --> 20:23.988
If you see it again can you let
us know.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.394
It might need our help.

20:26.127 --> 20:27.259
Actually...

20:27.261 --> 20:29.331
you can come with us tomorrow I
mean,

20:29.530 --> 20:30.899
he'll come around?

20:31.298 --> 20:32.299
Uh.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.834
We got class.

20:34.035 --> 20:36.139
I don't have class, so I'm game.

20:37.271 --> 20:38.238
Cool.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.840
- Hey guys!
- Hey Sunshine!

20:40.842 --> 20:41.910
Here try this.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.844
I still have no idea what conch
is, but here we go.

20:45.846 --> 20:47.848
Ah, there he goes.

20:48.382 --> 20:49.414
- How is it?
- Mmm.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.449
Right?

20:50.452 --> 20:51.453
Not bad.

20:51.885 --> 20:53.384
- I kinda like it.
- Taino Island man.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.153
Welcome to Taino beach.

20:55.155 --> 20:56.889
Your hair is so pretty.

20:56.891 --> 20:58.160
Ah, thank you.

20:58.526 --> 21:00.892
My mom taught me how
to do it as a kid.

21:00.894 --> 21:02.897
She did my hair all the time.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.503
- Excuse me guys.
- Is she OK?

21:27.922 --> 21:28.889
Hey water bug.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.457
Please go back inside.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.900
- What's wrong?
- I want mom to come back.

21:45.105 --> 21:46.105
I miss her too.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.975
She is here with us.

21:49.241 --> 21:51.311
I see her everyday when I look
at you.

21:53.113 --> 21:55.548
But mom never taught me to fish
tail.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.150
I'll tell you what,

21:59.152 --> 22:01.488
Why don't you let me learn how
to do the fish tail.

22:02.453 --> 22:05.124
I'll make the best looking
fish tail you've ever seen.

22:05.457 --> 22:06.926
It'll be a disaster.

22:08.093 --> 22:10.331
It'll be the best looking
disaster you've ever seen.

22:10.562 --> 22:12.365
Dad you're such a cheeseball.

22:12.631 --> 22:13.900
And proud of it.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.935
Come on, you know it'll look
good.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.008
You wanna go back and join
everyone?

22:23.241 --> 22:24.243
Yeah.

22:31.249 --> 22:32.251
Dom!

22:32.517 --> 22:33.518
Hey!

22:34.018 --> 22:35.020
Dom!

22:35.652 --> 22:37.022
Where this boy is?

22:37.456 --> 22:39.025
What is it Naz?

22:40.092 --> 22:41.992
How 'bout you and me work this
out man?

22:41.994 --> 22:43.360
What your problem is?

22:43.362 --> 22:45.293
I didn't touch your lines.

22:45.295 --> 22:46.530
My man.

22:46.532 --> 22:49.466
The lines been cut, and I know
it was you!

22:49.468 --> 22:51.233
Someone cut your lines?

22:51.235 --> 22:52.369
- No.
- Stop lying!

22:52.371 --> 22:54.035
Hey man not in here.

22:54.037 --> 22:55.437
Let me tell you something.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.141
You try to take money out my
pocket.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.308
Food out my children mouth.

22:59.310 --> 23:00.914
And you have me to deal with.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.547
Uh, Excuse me.

23:02.980 --> 23:04.612
Moe coming through, uh, Cap...

23:04.614 --> 23:07.315
- There ain't no need for this. Let's go.
- Moe.

23:07.317 --> 23:09.153
Nobody here cut your buoys.

23:10.254 --> 23:12.088
- Alright.
- Let me see you in the ocean...

23:12.090 --> 23:14.226
- Take a walk boys!
- Let's go, yeah.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.093
- I see everything that go on.
- Oh, OK big guy.

23:18.095 --> 23:20.364
That's just so messed up.

23:22.766 --> 23:24.265
You alright bud?

23:24.267 --> 23:25.602
Watch out man!

23:27.671 --> 23:28.673
Locals man.

23:32.342 --> 23:33.343
OK! What's up?

23:56.666 --> 23:59.338
You know you're mom spent a
lot time out here too.

24:00.370 --> 24:02.273
She loved swimming out here.

24:04.740 --> 24:07.077
Your mom got you swimming at
three years old.

24:09.478 --> 24:10.779
I couldn't get either one of
y'all

24:10.781 --> 24:12.249
out of the water that summer.

24:13.717 --> 24:15.284
That was y'alls thing.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.222
When I put you down at night,

24:18.721 --> 24:20.588
I had to check you for gills.

24:20.590 --> 24:22.392
Cause you were like a little
fish.

24:28.465 --> 24:29.531
She...

24:29.533 --> 24:32.067
She would know how to get
you back in the water.

24:32.069 --> 24:33.336
She knew everything.

24:44.546 --> 24:46.248
She's right here with us bud.

24:47.851 --> 24:49.387
She's always with us.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.024
She's right here.

24:56.191 --> 24:57.693
She's right there buddy.

25:00.095 --> 25:01.697
Come on. Let's go get some
sleep.

25:26.421 --> 25:27.555
Dad.

25:27.754 --> 25:29.491
- Are you awake?
- No. No.

25:31.694 --> 25:32.796
What?

25:33.194 --> 25:34.596
What are you two doing?

25:37.899 --> 25:39.667
Yeah the dolphin you said.

25:40.601 --> 25:41.602
Alright.

25:42.870 --> 25:44.705
You guys cook me breakfast?

25:47.774 --> 25:48.843
You guys!

26:17.638 --> 26:18.639
Hey cap.

26:19.906 --> 26:23.243
Trying to look like a rich man
boat on this side of the island.

26:23.676 --> 26:24.910
You see that over there?

26:24.912 --> 26:26.514
Right, right there. Right there.

26:26.812 --> 26:28.148
Yeah you see that?

26:28.447 --> 26:29.649
Way over there man.

26:30.416 --> 26:32.250
You get your sea legs yet
captain?

26:32.252 --> 26:33.285
Yes ma'am.

26:33.287 --> 26:34.519
Never lost them.

26:34.521 --> 26:35.854
I was raised on a boat.

26:35.856 --> 26:37.756
Been on it since I was a little
kid.

26:37.758 --> 26:39.560
So where's this little renegade
at?

26:39.859 --> 26:42.227
Well if he's spending time at
the docks,

26:42.229 --> 26:43.794
He shouldn't be too far out.

26:43.797 --> 26:45.332
He's probably lonely.

26:48.234 --> 26:49.934
He's gotta be around here
somewhere.

26:49.936 --> 26:52.635
He probably saw your happy faces
at the

26:52.637 --> 26:54.337
dock and wanted to play

26:54.339 --> 26:55.876
Dad! There he is!

26:56.676 --> 26:57.677
There he is!

26:59.345 --> 27:01.248
- Look at that!
- Dad do you see him!

27:02.982 --> 27:04.415
Look at him! Whoa!

27:04.417 --> 27:05.851
He's getting some height!

27:07.386 --> 27:08.454
Awesome!

27:26.905 --> 27:27.706
Hey there guy.

27:28.540 --> 27:30.543
What are you doing all alone?

27:32.511 --> 27:35.682
Hey!
That's not the buoy we used before.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.279
Where'd you get that?

27:37.281 --> 27:39.481
He chewed
right through the rope.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.483
That looks like a lobster trap
line.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.721
Yeah and whoever set it won't
be happy.

27:43.723 --> 27:44.754
Hey.

27:44.756 --> 27:46.457
Those belong to the fisherman.

27:46.459 --> 27:49.025
We shouldn't be playing with
that now should we big boy.

27:49.860 --> 27:51.996
Dolphin's usually travel in
groups

27:51.998 --> 27:54.467
like a family, they're called
pods.

27:54.733 --> 27:56.366
What happened to your family?

28:00.605 --> 28:02.575
They need social interaction.

28:03.540 --> 28:05.441
I honestly think it could be
loneliness

28:05.443 --> 28:06.742
bring him this close to us.

28:06.744 --> 28:08.577
Can we bring it back to its
family?

28:10.481 --> 28:11.482
We could try.

28:12.517 --> 28:15.321
They use echo location to
talk to each other.

28:15.586 --> 28:17.955
They can hear up to
200 meters out.

28:18.955 --> 28:20.089
If a...

28:20.091 --> 28:23.628
Pod passes, we can try to get
him closer to earshot.

28:24.995 --> 28:25.997
Then we'll go.

28:33.471 --> 28:36.441
Don't worry, we'll get you back
to your pod.

28:49.987 --> 28:51.256
Oh no.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.891
What do they want?

28:54.657 --> 28:56.924
Come on. Come on boy just let it
go.

28:56.926 --> 28:58.562
Come on boy. Let it go.

28:58.896 --> 29:00.862
Please drop it Echo.

29:00.864 --> 29:01.865
Drop the buoy!

29:02.732 --> 29:03.798
Oh no.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.400
Hey we're out of her now!

29:05.402 --> 29:07.368
Now now, come on, come on.

29:07.370 --> 29:09.438
- Come on, come on.
- I'm getting you guys away from that buoy

29:09.440 --> 29:12.039
- and those fishermen now.
- No we can't he has the buoy in his mouth!

29:12.041 --> 29:14.475
I need you to, look, just drop
it, please.

29:14.477 --> 29:16.747
- Give us the buoy.
- Come on.

29:19.114 --> 29:20.782
Give me the buoy. Give. Give.

29:20.784 --> 29:21.886
Give me the buoy.

29:22.585 --> 29:24.017
Give me the buoy.

29:25.121 --> 29:27.358
- Give me the buoy.
- Gentle, gentle.

29:27.924 --> 29:29.622
- Give me the buoy.
- Dad watch out

29:29.625 --> 29:30.658
you're gonna fall!

29:30.660 --> 29:32.763
- Give me the bou...
- Whoa!

29:39.701 --> 29:41.936
- Don't let them see him.
- Hide him dad.

29:41.938 --> 29:43.707
Hide. Hide. Shhh.

29:50.645 --> 29:51.647
Shhh.

29:54.883 --> 29:55.885
Hey Nova!

29:56.886 --> 29:58.922
Looks like you got more recruits
for the T.U.C.C.

29:59.122 --> 30:00.887
- Everything cool.
- You didn't even

30:00.890 --> 30:02.889
introduce me to your new friend,
man.

30:02.892 --> 30:03.826
Get lost Moe!

30:06.795 --> 30:08.797
That's how you
can carry on over.

30:08.998 --> 30:10.499
Alright.

30:10.966 --> 30:12.802
Oh man cap you see that?

30:13.168 --> 30:15.103
Man she ain't on our run man.

30:16.405 --> 30:18.807
Everything cool Nova, we'll
catch you next time.

30:32.853 --> 30:33.855
Good job boy.

30:34.823 --> 30:37.622
Hey pull me back to the boat
can you do that?

30:37.624 --> 30:38.728
Which one of you?

30:39.193 --> 30:40.395
Yes I knew it.

30:40.694 --> 30:42.629
So..what I'm actually doing is

30:43.898 --> 30:44.999
calibrating this,

30:45.632 --> 30:47.769
gauge, because the last time I
dove,

30:48.002 --> 30:50.472
- I ran out of oxygen.
- How y'all doing guys?

30:50.705 --> 30:52.071
There we go. What up girls!

30:52.073 --> 30:53.641
- Hey!
- Hey guys!

30:54.475 --> 30:55.741
How was that dive?

30:55.743 --> 30:58.812
- It was alright.
- See anything interesting?

30:58.814 --> 31:00.447
- Same old, same old.
- Not really this time.

31:00.449 --> 31:01.679
What are you guys doing?

31:01.681 --> 31:03.782
I'm trying to make sure that I
don't

31:03.784 --> 31:06.118
explode, the next time I dive.

31:06.120 --> 31:09.391
How do you find a dolphin pod in
Taino island?

31:10.690 --> 31:11.793
Uhh, OK

31:12.460 --> 31:13.760
So...

31:13.762 --> 31:16.661
Taino is cool because it is
completely surrounded by coral.

31:16.663 --> 31:18.897
And it's why pirates actually
love this island

31:18.899 --> 31:21.533
Because there's a giant coral
reef

31:21.535 --> 31:23.071
that surrounds the entire
island.

31:23.470 --> 31:24.671
This. Taino island.

31:25.706 --> 31:26.708
And...

31:26.939 --> 31:28.476
Say this is the reef.

31:28.875 --> 31:31.676
Goes all around the island, all
zig zaggy.

31:31.678 --> 31:32.946
Except in two spots.

31:33.947 --> 31:35.080
So back in the day

31:35.082 --> 31:37.147
coral grew so high that ships

31:37.149 --> 31:39.786
who were coming to the island
for the first time didn't know.

31:40.053 --> 31:41.890
And the ships would hit the
island and sink.

31:42.121 --> 31:43.987
That's why there's all this
buried treasure.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.525
All around here.

31:45.792 --> 31:47.257
So all of the dolphins are
swimming

31:47.259 --> 31:48.528
around here now.

31:49.729 --> 31:51.198
That probably got Echo, stuck
in the inside of the reef.

31:51.598 --> 31:53.598
Because you know it's low tide
during the day,

31:53.600 --> 31:54.698
And high tide during the night.

31:54.700 --> 31:56.869
And the dolphins feed
only in the day really.

31:56.871 --> 31:59.106
And so what probably
happened with our dolphin.

31:59.938 --> 32:00.972
Is,

32:00.974 --> 32:02.205
He got separated

32:02.207 --> 32:03.273
the tide rose

32:03.275 --> 32:04.841
he got blocked by the coral.

32:04.843 --> 32:06.010
And he couldn't escape

32:06.012 --> 32:08.212
so all of his friends, ditched
him.

32:08.214 --> 32:09.746
cause they're not good friends.

32:09.748 --> 32:11.117
Don't do that to your friends.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.719
What about echo location?

32:14.786 --> 32:16.553
Pods not even going to get close
enough

32:16.555 --> 32:17.922
so that they can hear each
other.

32:17.924 --> 32:20.624
- Yeah that's the thing.
- Yeah cause this is,

32:20.626 --> 32:21.992
the great wall of China.

32:21.994 --> 32:24.595
Two openings.
We have another opening on the south west

32:24.597 --> 32:26.030
part, that's where all the
fishermen

32:26.032 --> 32:28.564
go out, and yeah majority of
them live there too.

32:28.566 --> 32:31.201
And, so we gonna have to try and
focus,

32:31.203 --> 32:33.102
- get something to focus them to come in.
- Got it yeah.

32:33.104 --> 32:34.871
Cause they're
feeding, they already have

32:34.873 --> 32:35.872
enough fish on the
outside of the reef.

32:35.874 --> 32:37.139
We could do that we can think
of something.

32:37.142 --> 32:38.274
So we just need to find

32:38.276 --> 32:40.042
something to attract them here.

32:40.044 --> 32:41.645
Exactly other than fish.

32:41.647 --> 32:43.850
Looks like we
found our porpoise.

32:44.248 --> 32:47.152
Oh my god, I love that so much.

32:49.154 --> 32:51.491
Keep it up, I love the dad
jokes.

32:53.992 --> 32:55.157
Hey Collard.

32:55.159 --> 32:56.792
Collard what's going on big
brother.

32:56.794 --> 32:57.796
- Hey.
- Hey!

32:58.863 --> 33:00.797
- You guys are off today?
- Nah, big brother.

33:00.799 --> 33:04.070
No dives today, we have to get
word out on this.

33:04.835 --> 33:06.636
Oh yeah I've seen a few of these
around.

33:06.638 --> 33:08.605
- What's going on?
- Young blood Luke,

33:08.607 --> 33:10.673
he found a bottle nose out there
on Taino man.

33:10.675 --> 33:11.674
Nice.

33:11.676 --> 33:13.076
Coolest animal in the ocean huh?

33:13.078 --> 33:14.210
Yeah definitely.

33:14.212 --> 33:16.145
He's alone separated from his
pod.

33:16.147 --> 33:18.818
Yeah we've been out canvassing
the area with these flyers.

33:19.083 --> 33:20.950
Hopefully someone seen some
dolphins and we

33:20.952 --> 33:22.885
can get this little guy
joined back with a pod.

33:22.887 --> 33:25.120
Yeah good idea, I'll hang
these up in the shop.

33:25.122 --> 33:27.690
The marina's right there,
you guys should really

33:27.692 --> 33:29.862
check around maybe ask some of
the captains.

33:30.128 --> 33:33.663
You think if we go by Xanadu beach
or by Taino beach or something.

33:33.665 --> 33:36.701
- They seen any dolphins out that area lately?
- I haven't been there in a minute.

33:37.167 --> 33:38.837
It wouldn't hurt to try.

33:39.658 --> 33:41.535
Think there's any way to talk to
the guys running the dive boats.

33:41.805 --> 33:43.672
Maybe they've seen some dolphins
out diving.

33:43.674 --> 33:45.007
Yeah I can make a few calls.

33:45.009 --> 33:46.645
Shouldn't be a problem.

33:46.910 --> 33:48.043
Yeah man, thanks man.

33:48.045 --> 33:50.047
- Always good to see you brother.
- Thanks Collard!

33:50.281 --> 33:51.816
- I appreciate it.
- Anytime.

33:52.882 --> 33:53.884
Where?

33:54.084 --> 33:55.686
- Where'd they go?
- Where they go to.

33:55.919 --> 33:56.921
Hey!

34:08.331 --> 34:09.333
Hey!

34:12.301 --> 34:14.039
You forgetting something?

34:17.741 --> 34:20.878
Boy, y'all got a lot of
nerve cutting my lines.

34:23.879 --> 34:26.350
- We found them, we found them like that.
- Find them?

34:29.118 --> 34:30.885
Boy kid, if there's one thing I
can smell

34:30.887 --> 34:32.219
from a mile away is a liar.

34:32.222 --> 34:34.623
We can smell you from a mile
away.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.659
We're just here
to help our friend.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.231
Your friend is who?

34:41.663 --> 34:42.800
It's a dolphin.

34:47.902 --> 34:50.304
- Dolphin?
- Oh, you like dolphins kid.

34:51.139 --> 34:52.141
Dolphins!

34:52.373 --> 34:53.376
They pest!

34:54.610 --> 34:57.880
- You know what pest get right?
- Hey what's going on?

35:01.850 --> 35:03.017
Kids come here.

35:03.019 --> 35:05.118
Just teaching them marine
etiquette finer points.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.089
Ah man look who it is.

35:09.124 --> 35:10.359
Where he come from?

35:11.693 --> 35:13.460
I do not want you talking to my
kids.

35:13.462 --> 35:15.929
If you got a problem you talk to
me.

35:15.931 --> 35:17.264
And who you supposed to be?

35:17.266 --> 35:18.267
Captain planet?

35:18.467 --> 35:19.699
Come on kids, let's go.

35:19.701 --> 35:22.872
If I gotta watch my traps, then
you better watch your back.

35:53.368 --> 35:55.238
I wish I could get in
there with you dude but...

35:55.836 --> 35:57.138
I can't swim.

35:58.272 --> 35:59.408
Whatever.

36:00.475 --> 36:02.178
You wouldn't understand.

36:05.079 --> 36:08.115
How do we even know if
he's going to join the Pod.

36:08.348 --> 36:12.086
Something truly special about
these creatures is that,

36:12.419 --> 36:14.819
Even outside of their immediate
family

36:14.821 --> 36:17.224
they associate as if they're all
family.

36:18.023 --> 36:19.694
Are they gonna like,

36:19.993 --> 36:21.093
accept him.

36:21.095 --> 36:22.828
Even if they don't know him.

36:22.830 --> 36:24.398
Of course, the population
structure

36:24.799 --> 36:26.464
in pods are always changing

36:26.466 --> 36:28.301
because of age and gender

36:28.769 --> 36:29.770
But,

36:30.238 --> 36:32.036
A pod would accept a lone
dolphin

36:32.038 --> 36:33.972
based on their common
understanding

36:33.975 --> 36:36.876
that a sense of belonging is all
they need.

36:42.383 --> 36:44.719
Why can't he
just stay with us then?

36:44.985 --> 36:45.986
Forever!

36:47.186 --> 36:49.290
Instead of living with dolphins.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.931
Sky, they don't survive on their
own.

36:57.396 --> 36:58.496
They need,

36:58.499 --> 37:00.467
a group to protect each other

37:01.001 --> 37:02.836
someone they can depend on.

37:03.836 --> 37:05.005
A family.

37:24.022 --> 37:25.255
No it's just a close up.

37:25.257 --> 37:26.824
So what's the Marines like?

37:26.826 --> 37:28.062
The marines?

37:28.894 --> 37:30.493
We study marine biology.

37:31.898 --> 37:32.899
Close!

37:33.832 --> 37:35.200
Well you guys are oceanography
students.

37:35.466 --> 37:37.168
- Yeah.
- You know someone in the program

37:37.170 --> 37:38.234
that could help out?

37:38.236 --> 37:39.903
Simmons would have helped us.

37:39.905 --> 37:41.541
Nah man, that guy is crazy.

37:42.909 --> 37:45.408
Simmons man, Simmons is mad
crazy, nah.

37:45.410 --> 37:47.446
Crazy but he would have helped.

37:47.946 --> 37:50.013
He was our marine bio teacher.

37:50.015 --> 37:51.017
It was,

37:51.482 --> 37:52.616
hotly debated

37:52.618 --> 37:55.152
as to whether he was an
actual employee of the school.

37:57.156 --> 37:58.621
He might have just snuck
into an office and then

37:58.623 --> 38:00.794
sat there until somebody told
him to leave.

38:02.025 --> 38:03.160
Which was a long time.

38:03.162 --> 38:04.430
He was freaking old.

38:04.997 --> 38:07.063
He spent most of his life
experimenting

38:07.065 --> 38:08.934
with ways to communicate with to
dolphins.

38:09.201 --> 38:10.837
Uhh, let me show you.

38:13.439 --> 38:15.542
- Check this out, this is Simmons.
- Yes!

38:15.940 --> 38:16.906
Remember this?

38:16.908 --> 38:19.140
Is he playing
a piano underwater?

38:19.142 --> 38:20.309
The man!

38:20.311 --> 38:22.644
Yes... that's a 1200 pound piano.

38:22.647 --> 38:25.217
It was an absolute blast getting
that onto a boat.

38:25.484 --> 38:28.316
You know that's one of his first
concepts. And his first disaster.

38:28.318 --> 38:30.988
He was trying to make music
underwater.

38:31.956 --> 38:33.425
He had this theory that,

38:33.624 --> 38:36.591
dolphins respond to music the
same way that we do.

38:36.594 --> 38:39.331
They... enjoy the rhythm and the
tone and,

38:40.497 --> 38:42.231
it's just you have to have a

38:42.233 --> 38:44.202
giant music box to be able to,

38:44.534 --> 38:45.367
test it out.

38:45.369 --> 38:47.102
Man that's underwater though

38:47.104 --> 38:48.536
ain't no instrument work
underwater.

38:48.539 --> 38:49.536
Come on man.

38:49.539 --> 38:51.240
He was never proven to be wrong.

38:51.242 --> 38:52.973
How do you play music underwater

38:52.975 --> 38:54.142
long enough to

38:54.144 --> 38:55.178
happen by a pod

38:55.479 --> 38:57.078
and see if it works.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.913
Have any of them worked?

38:58.915 --> 39:00.016
Uh, the whistler.

39:00.385 --> 39:01.216
The whistler worked.

39:01.218 --> 39:03.083
It cost him his job, but it
worked.

39:03.085 --> 39:04.320
I knew you were say that.

39:04.322 --> 39:05.590
What's the whistler?

39:06.324 --> 39:09.223
The whistler was a device that
replicated

39:09.226 --> 39:11.160
language patterns he found in
Cetacea

39:11.162 --> 39:13.162
And Simmons found a way
to project it long

39:13.164 --> 39:15.196
range without any harmful
effects of sonar.

39:15.198 --> 39:16.199
Let's get it.

39:16.565 --> 39:18.335
I mean we could try and get it
but,

39:18.602 --> 39:19.636
it's underwater.

39:20.171 --> 39:21.173
Oh.

39:22.406 --> 39:25.339
Yeah right before he left
the island he sank his boat

39:25.341 --> 39:28.078
and, uh, along with all of his
projects.

39:29.045 --> 39:31.947
In his last days he was
refurbishing old musical equipment

39:31.949 --> 39:34.485
scrapping all kinds of boat parts
from wherever on the island.

39:34.984 --> 39:37.085
Well rumor on the island was
that

39:37.087 --> 39:38.319
the fishermen did it to Simmons

39:38.321 --> 39:40.624
they were trying to put a
hold on the grouper trapping.

39:41.190 --> 39:42.122
Well, where's his boat at?

39:42.124 --> 39:45.027
It's a quarter mile out of his
property.

39:45.294 --> 39:46.998
Way off shore.

39:47.464 --> 39:49.298
And about forty feet below.

39:49.732 --> 39:52.131
Guys those
coordinates are not like exact.

39:52.133 --> 39:55.070
But dude we need time to
locate this thing and we only have...

39:55.338 --> 39:57.475
- Yeah.
- One hour on a full tank.

39:58.475 --> 39:59.707
It's hard to find.

39:59.709 --> 40:01.743
I mean if we had more divers.

40:01.745 --> 40:02.676
But there's,

40:02.678 --> 40:04.711
there's no guarantee that the
corrosion

40:04.713 --> 40:07.314
hasn't just destroyed all of the
parts

40:07.316 --> 40:08.249
anyways.

40:08.251 --> 40:10.084
It'll take forever
just to put them back

40:10.086 --> 40:11.489
together and see
if they even work.

40:12.620 --> 40:14.655
We have to at least try I
mean...

40:14.657 --> 40:17.093
If we don't try, we don't
succeed.

40:18.093 --> 40:19.093
Right?

40:19.095 --> 40:21.097
I mean yeah I guess.

40:21.630 --> 40:22.863
Ahh.

40:22.865 --> 40:24.999
Kind of seems like
a lost cause at this point.

40:25.001 --> 40:26.133
It's probably in pieces by now.

40:26.135 --> 40:28.237
You guys don't know
Simmons this dude was...

40:28.738 --> 40:29.940
bananas.

40:30.305 --> 40:31.671
There's no telling if this

40:31.673 --> 40:33.309
is even remotely possible.

40:34.074 --> 40:35.076
I scuba.

40:37.344 --> 40:39.114
You have your divers cert?

40:39.314 --> 40:40.316
Oh yeah.

40:40.748 --> 40:42.249
Spring break, Caba.

40:44.185 --> 40:45.588
Didn't we all?

40:50.759 --> 40:52.360
You know my wife used to say,

40:52.627 --> 40:54.293
you can sit around your whole
life

40:54.295 --> 40:55.697
with just your toes in the water

40:56.563 --> 40:58.000
or you can dive in.

41:04.806 --> 41:06.141
I say let's do it.

41:07.375 --> 41:08.507
I'm in.

41:08.509 --> 41:09.511
Me too.

41:10.677 --> 41:12.080
You got me, I'm in.

41:13.047 --> 41:14.079
Alright.

41:14.081 --> 41:15.083
- Let's get it!
- Great!

41:15.649 --> 41:16.681
6 AM tomorrow?

41:16.683 --> 41:17.749
Ooh.

41:19.721 --> 41:20.723
Yup.

41:22.655 --> 41:23.657
Alright.

41:27.462 --> 41:28.464
Is that good?

41:28.662 --> 41:29.694
Little tight.

41:29.696 --> 41:31.364
Well, stop skipping leg day.

41:31.366 --> 41:33.369
There is no such thing as leg
day.

41:35.135 --> 41:36.205
Rule number one,

41:37.205 --> 41:38.305
steady breathing.

41:40.173 --> 41:42.140
If he stays with me he'll
survive.

41:42.142 --> 41:43.379
Can I get that in writing.

41:46.280 --> 41:47.647
This is the place guys.

41:48.615 --> 41:49.446
Hey sweetie,

41:49.448 --> 41:51.348
if you see any fishing boats out
here

41:51.350 --> 41:52.584
you blow the horn.

41:52.587 --> 41:54.455
I can hear it underwater I'll be
right up.

41:54.655 --> 41:55.656
My hero.

41:56.990 --> 41:59.723
Uh, remember you gotta
take a big step out frontwards.

41:59.725 --> 42:00.758
Frontwards.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.428
Clint, turn around dude.

42:45.704 --> 42:48.271
Chop. Chop. Chopped and screwed.

42:48.273 --> 42:50.576
Chop. Chop. Chopped and screwed.

42:50.775 --> 42:53.079
Chop. Chop. Chopped and screwed.

42:53.377 --> 42:55.548
Disappoint my father.

43:03.156 --> 43:05.154
Luke look there he is!

43:05.157 --> 43:06.257
Hey Echo!

43:06.259 --> 43:07.756
Oh no you got another one.

43:07.758 --> 43:09.692
Echo stop with the buoys!

43:09.694 --> 43:11.195
Those aren't yours!

43:11.197 --> 43:13.229
No more fetch crazy people are
trying

43:13.231 --> 43:14.634
to kill you for this stuff.

44:16.726 --> 44:18.795
Guys! Guys! Echo can hear this!

44:19.563 --> 44:21.833
Echo can hear this under the
water!

44:30.907 --> 44:31.909
Boss!

44:34.545 --> 44:35.743
Boss!

44:35.745 --> 44:37.278
Look what they doing!

44:37.280 --> 44:38.846
Man it looks like you got a
problem there!

44:38.848 --> 44:41.349
Boss I need some money so I can
put fuel in

44:41.351 --> 44:43.586
my rig and get out there and
check my trap.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.520
No no no, you gotta bring
lobsters in if you want money.

44:46.522 --> 44:47.990
Come on I got my
family, I just need a

44:47.992 --> 44:49.857
little advance so I can put fuel
in my boat.

44:49.859 --> 44:51.459
- Sorry.
- So I can get out there and check

44:51.461 --> 44:53.661
Sorry man we're not a charity
here!

44:53.663 --> 44:55.962
There ain't no way you need
to bring lobsters in here.

44:55.964 --> 44:59.602
You're the tenth one here
today looking for charity.

45:39.941 --> 45:43.309
Baby girl,
I love you more than diamonds and pearls.

45:43.311 --> 45:46.615
- Babes thats you?
- Just what my weary eyes needed.

45:47.316 --> 45:49.548
Only girl more beautiful than
the island itself.

45:49.550 --> 45:51.253
- See my baby.
- And you,

45:51.653 --> 45:54.320
The only fishermen she'd ever
let kiss her.

45:56.458 --> 45:57.956
- Mm mmm, what you say baby?
- Everything's good.

45:57.958 --> 45:58.791
Feeling any better?

45:58.793 --> 46:00.894
Everything's good baby, you
alright?

46:00.896 --> 46:02.828
- Where I belong now.
- Good.

46:02.831 --> 46:05.096
Hey Moe! You been keeping my
boy safe today!

46:05.098 --> 46:06.865
Well you see we
back in one piece right?

46:06.867 --> 46:08.036
All I can ask for.

46:08.869 --> 46:10.271
- OK.
- Hey!

46:11.473 --> 46:13.342
- What's on your mind.
- I was at the market earlier.

46:14.040 --> 46:16.477
- I overheard some of the other guys talking.
- Yeah?

46:16.778 --> 46:17.780
'Bout what?

46:18.880 --> 46:20.882
They're saying that someone's
been cutting traps?

46:24.552 --> 46:25.583
Really?

46:25.585 --> 46:27.689
Yeah, you don't be hearing that?

46:28.054 --> 46:29.056
Uh uh.

46:29.489 --> 46:30.456
Right Moe?

46:30.458 --> 46:32.560
You hear anything about traps
getting cut?

46:32.893 --> 46:34.830
No not that I know of, uh uh.

46:35.563 --> 46:36.795
No sir, nope.

46:36.797 --> 46:39.565
I know some of the other trappers
are struggling right now.

46:39.568 --> 46:41.567
- Yeah.
- And I even overheard Roscoe saying

46:41.570 --> 46:43.701
that he can't afford to get new
traps to start over.

46:43.703 --> 46:45.506
There you go again with your
doting baby.

46:45.873 --> 46:47.342
Everything cress, alright.

46:47.707 --> 46:49.910
Me and Malik just come from
doing a big haul.

46:50.143 --> 46:52.810
See me and Moe getting the chop
ready we're gonna head back out.

46:52.812 --> 46:54.681
Everything will be just fine
baby, OK?

46:54.982 --> 46:55.984
Trust me baby.

46:56.484 --> 46:58.585
These big hands can hold it all.

46:58.853 --> 47:00.054
OK, but you know,

47:01.155 --> 47:03.421
If we need I can take some
shifts at the bungalow.

47:03.423 --> 47:04.425
The only thing,

47:04.890 --> 47:06.057
we need,

47:06.059 --> 47:08.096
is for you to feel better baby.

47:09.528 --> 47:11.162
You gotta get plenty of rest,

47:11.164 --> 47:12.829
stay nice and healthy.

47:12.831 --> 47:15.101
And bring my progeny into the
world

47:16.001 --> 47:17.771
That's the future king of Taino.

47:18.038 --> 47:19.540
Nah, just the prince.

47:20.706 --> 47:22.642
His daddy's already the king.

47:24.145 --> 47:24.945
You know it.

47:25.711 --> 47:28.381
Look here, I want you go home,
rest up.

47:28.881 --> 47:30.580
Take a nice little bath.

47:30.582 --> 47:31.883
I'll be home later.

47:31.885 --> 47:33.486
Me and Moe can finish all this
work.

47:33.952 --> 47:34.818
OK well,

47:34.820 --> 47:37.021
- You ain't gotta tell me twice.
- Aaah.

47:37.023 --> 47:38.025
Bye bye Moe.

47:39.425 --> 47:41.991
You don't mind if I carry cap
for a drink.

47:41.993 --> 47:43.396
Like one, just one.

47:44.497 --> 47:46.430
- Or six!
- Man don't lie to her.

47:46.432 --> 47:48.701
More than six, I'll bring him
home.

48:05.116 --> 48:06.118
Cap.

48:08.754 --> 48:09.755
Cap?

48:12.024 --> 48:13.025
Naz.

48:14.025 --> 48:14.958
Cap!

48:14.960 --> 48:17.930
Oh come on man, talk to me man
it's Moe.

48:18.563 --> 48:21.000
Man whatever you need me to do,
you know I got yo' back.

48:22.500 --> 48:24.136
For you and the future king.

48:25.669 --> 48:26.671
Yo, Moe.

48:29.941 --> 48:32.007
We gonna have to build some
bigger traps brother.

48:33.745 --> 48:34.776
Let's head out!

48:34.778 --> 48:35.780
Let's do it!

48:37.081 --> 48:38.517
And I mean tonight!

48:46.090 --> 48:47.158
This is so cool.

48:48.059 --> 48:50.528
I can't believe it actually
worked.

48:50.995 --> 48:52.862
So did Echo really hear it?

48:52.864 --> 48:53.866
Oh yeah.

48:54.198 --> 48:55.598
He came right up to me.

48:55.600 --> 48:56.869
And as he got close,

48:57.568 --> 48:59.070
I could see him dancing.

49:01.071 --> 49:02.073
So,

49:03.073 --> 49:04.138
a p-a...

49:04.140 --> 49:05.744
a pod can...

49:06.077 --> 49:07.912
like faraway can hear this?

49:09.246 --> 49:10.449
Well,

49:10.980 --> 49:12.516
this is a little one.

49:15.218 --> 49:17.856
And Echo was only a hundred feet
away.

49:20.190 --> 49:21.223
I'll tell you what,

49:21.225 --> 49:22.824
Simmons was on to something.

49:22.826 --> 49:24.029
So he wasn't crazy.

49:28.765 --> 49:29.968
Maybe a good crazy.

49:35.606 --> 49:37.007
Alright, time for bed.

49:37.840 --> 49:38.842
Scoot down.

49:40.210 --> 49:41.309
There we go.

49:41.311 --> 49:44.145
Dad I've been reading a lot
about dolphins lately.

49:44.147 --> 49:44.978
Really?

49:44.980 --> 49:46.780
They speak their own language,
with

49:46.782 --> 49:48.650
clicking patterns to talk to
each other.

49:48.652 --> 49:51.222
- I didn't know that.
- I really hope the whistler works.

49:52.288 --> 49:54.023
Me too baby girl, me too.

49:56.226 --> 49:58.126
We are gonna find a way

49:58.128 --> 49:59.129
to get Echo,

49:59.328 --> 50:00.563
back with a pod.

50:00.964 --> 50:01.931
'Kay.

50:02.831 --> 50:04.234
You just need to believe in
yourself.

50:05.869 --> 50:07.101
I believe in you.

50:07.103 --> 50:08.201
Thanks dad.

50:08.203 --> 50:09.337
You're welcome.

50:24.319 --> 50:25.522
Hey dude.

50:30.626 --> 50:32.762
How do you even swim in your
sleep?

50:33.896 --> 50:35.798
You're in the water nonstop.

50:36.232 --> 50:39.769
Nova said you learned how to
swim before you were even born.

50:48.610 --> 50:50.077
Kind of like my mom did

50:51.346 --> 50:52.649
When I was a kid.

50:55.249 --> 50:57.019
She taught me how to swim.

51:01.256 --> 51:03.623
But ever since she passed I felt
like

51:03.625 --> 51:05.561
if I fall in I would sink.

51:14.336 --> 51:15.972
Think I would sink?

51:25.146 --> 51:26.148
What?

51:26.713 --> 51:27.715
What?

51:28.181 --> 51:29.183
Stop.

51:32.387 --> 51:33.589
Hey watch it!

51:35.722 --> 51:36.724
I'll... Ah.

51:38.159 --> 51:40.095
Yeah I know you want to play.

51:40.695 --> 51:41.963
But I can't. I just can't

51:44.965 --> 51:47.733
Can you just be serious for a
second?

51:47.735 --> 51:49.835
Echo I need your serious face.

51:49.837 --> 51:50.838
Seriously.

51:53.173 --> 51:54.175
Oh wow Echo.

51:54.442 --> 51:56.645
Thank you so much.

52:23.035 --> 52:25.236
Well who gets to swim with
a real life dolphin

52:25.238 --> 52:26.406
It's now or never.

52:27.006 --> 52:28.675
Don't let me fall under.

52:30.176 --> 52:31.178
I mean it dude.

52:45.225 --> 52:46.894
OK, this was a bad idea!

52:47.861 --> 52:48.863
Aaah!

52:52.332 --> 52:53.833
Well this was stupid!

52:58.336 --> 52:59.338
Ah!

53:35.374 --> 53:36.376
Not so bad.

53:36.808 --> 53:37.873
I gotta...

53:37.875 --> 53:38.776
I gotta tell dad.

53:42.847 --> 53:43.647
I was swimming!

54:37.034 --> 54:38.035
Luke!

54:42.939 --> 54:44.474
Hey you got in the water!

54:48.009 --> 54:49.343
I remember swimming with mom.

54:49.345 --> 54:50.146
It was amazing!

54:50.581 --> 54:52.316
I want to be back on the swim
team.

54:53.015 --> 54:54.048
Yes!

54:54.050 --> 54:56.018
That's what Im talking about.

54:56.285 --> 54:57.286
Come here.

55:00.891 --> 55:02.325
I'm proud of you buddy.

55:03.391 --> 55:04.528
Oh! Look at Echo!

55:04.994 --> 55:07.396
I guess you weren't swimming
alone were you?

55:08.297 --> 55:09.864
Probably wouldn't call it
swimming.

55:09.866 --> 55:12.537
Echo was probably doing circles
around you, huh?

57:23.764 --> 57:24.965
Hey cap.

57:26.265 --> 57:28.334
Looks like little man getting
close to that dolphin you know.

57:47.352 --> 57:48.319
Buddy,

57:48.321 --> 57:51.426
looks like our line ain't been
getting cut.

57:53.225 --> 57:54.660
It been getting chewed.

57:59.031 --> 58:00.598
Look like we might have to keep
an eye on

58:00.600 --> 58:02.265
Yankee boy with that
new fishy friend.

58:02.267 --> 58:04.470
- I'll keep an eye on him.
- Be sure you do that.

58:05.469 --> 58:08.006
Can't afford for no one to take
food out of our mouth.

58:08.240 --> 58:09.242
Not at all cap.

58:09.675 --> 58:10.774
Roger that.

58:10.776 --> 58:11.979
Leave it to me.

58:25.825 --> 58:27.361
Uhm...

58:28.293 --> 58:29.662
Guys I'm sorry the,

58:31.262 --> 58:32.999
the whistler didn't work.

58:33.764 --> 58:35.134
It's too corroded I can't,

58:35.333 --> 58:36.601
ugh, I can't figure it out

58:37.068 --> 58:39.038
what to do but I'm gonna keep
trying

58:39.371 --> 58:41.639
I want you to know that, and
just keep your head up.

58:42.107 --> 58:43.476
We'll figure this out.

59:56.346 --> 59:57.348
I have an idea!

01:00:01.416 --> 01:00:03.483
- Look right here look!
- Pipes are tied to the boat.

01:00:03.485 --> 01:00:04.851
We throw them overboard.

01:00:04.853 --> 01:00:06.220
So the pipes,

01:00:06.222 --> 01:00:07.387
- stay on the rope.
- OK.

01:00:07.389 --> 01:00:09.093
So they're hanging over the
side.

01:00:09.459 --> 01:00:10.926
Cause they're all tied
up to the things!

01:00:10.928 --> 01:00:12.526
Yeah that things!

01:00:12.528 --> 01:00:13.832
Yes the cleats!

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:15.396
But all the cleats!

01:00:15.398 --> 01:00:17.564
Cause you're gonna need a lot of
pipes.

01:00:17.567 --> 01:00:19.200
Cause they all
gotta bang together.

01:00:19.203 --> 01:00:20.901
Yeah like, Bong! Bong!

01:00:20.903 --> 01:00:23.606
So the pipes are
hanging on the side of the boat.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.305
And we can
totally hear it

01:00:25.307 --> 01:00:26.840
when metal clangs underwater.

01:00:26.842 --> 01:00:29.342
So you know dolphins can
hear way better! Echo location!

01:00:29.344 --> 01:00:32.381
And Nova said they can
hear up to 200 meters away.

01:00:33.215 --> 01:00:34.749
And the Ocean is always moving.

01:00:34.751 --> 01:00:37.783
And the boat can just stay
at the opening to let the pipes play

01:00:37.785 --> 01:00:40.789
And jangle together so the
dolphins can hear.

01:00:42.492 --> 01:00:43.460
Like a chime.

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.860
Exactly it'll do what
the whistler idea was meant to be.

01:00:46.862 --> 01:00:48.396
Well the whistler the clicks

01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:49.828
were in a musical rhythm, like

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:51.531
Bump, bump bump, bump bump, bump
bump.

01:00:51.533 --> 01:00:53.501
What better music to a dolphin

01:00:53.503 --> 01:00:55.534
then the rhythm of the ocean.

01:00:55.536 --> 01:00:57.906
Okay, but guys wait a second.

01:00:59.741 --> 01:01:02.578
It seems a little far fetched
though right?

01:01:02.944 --> 01:01:04.148
No!

01:01:05.614 --> 01:01:08.351
Not after everything you guys
taught us.

01:01:11.252 --> 01:01:14.352
Uh, I think I'm gonna have to
go with the kids on this one guys.

01:01:14.354 --> 01:01:17.524
Uh, if we get to toe this
instrument out in front of Taino,

01:01:17.526 --> 01:01:18.990
east though, east of the
opening,

01:01:18.992 --> 01:01:20.896
away from all the big freight
noise.

01:01:21.562 --> 01:01:22.864
Yeah, I think it'll work.

01:01:23.332 --> 01:01:24.564
Be like, bait without a hook.

01:01:24.567 --> 01:01:27.333
Yeah man,
if a pods around they gonna hear it.

01:01:27.335 --> 01:01:28.534
Echo needs our help!

01:01:28.536 --> 01:01:29.868
We only have two days left.

01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:32.306
Okay, so what do we do?

01:01:35.409 --> 01:01:36.812
I know where we can get some
metal.

01:01:37.478 --> 01:01:39.448
And I know a guy with a boat.

01:01:40.815 --> 01:01:42.185
I say let's do it.

01:03:48.406 --> 01:03:50.006
Yo Collard you there?

01:03:50.008 --> 01:03:52.041

01:03:52.043 --> 01:03:53.045

Do you remember how to drive?

01:04:00.083 --> 01:04:02.418
- Yeah definitely.
- Alright some of us gotta stay

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.420

telling how long this will take.

01:04:04.422 --> 01:04:05.721
Wait,

01:04:05.723 --> 01:04:07.492

morning?

01:04:07.725 --> 01:04:09.560
Uhm Nova says pick me up.

01:04:09.993 --> 01:04:11.128
Clint says...

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:12.395
Count me in.

01:04:12.398 --> 01:04:13.831
Skylar says I'm hungry.

01:04:16.167 --> 01:04:17.433
Hey!

01:04:17.435 --> 01:04:18.436
Old timer!

01:04:18.703 --> 01:04:19.705

01:04:21.438 --> 01:04:22.773
Don't touch my stuff!

01:04:22.974 --> 01:04:23.940
You're killing me man.

01:04:23.942 --> 01:04:26.409
- What you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.

01:04:26.411 --> 01:04:27.942
My ropes are cut again!

01:04:27.944 --> 01:04:29.113
I know it was you!

01:04:30.181 --> 01:04:30.979
- What are you gonna do about it.
- Don't you ever...

01:04:30.981 --> 01:04:33.714
- Huh!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:04:33.716 --> 01:04:34.915
Jokers, jokers, jokers.

01:04:34.918 --> 01:04:36.117
Y'all take it easy man.

01:04:36.119 --> 01:04:38.086
Take a look at this before you
throw blows.

01:04:38.088 --> 01:04:39.422

01:04:39.424 --> 01:04:40.956

How's that good?

01:05:19.696 --> 01:05:20.928
A little tight.

01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:22.633
It's supposed to be snug.

01:05:22.999 --> 01:05:24.001
Okay.

01:05:29.605 --> 01:05:31.605
You sure you've
done this before big man?

01:05:31.607 --> 01:05:32.843
I'll be fine sport.

01:05:33.477 --> 01:05:35.412

01:05:39.582 --> 01:05:41.117

What they say 'bout five
minutes?

01:05:46.087 --> 01:05:47.857
Maybe on Caribbean time.

01:05:48.056 --> 01:05:49.188
Pardon?

01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:50.526
You're going down with Nova.

01:05:50.793 --> 01:05:51.891
That a bad thing?

01:05:51.893 --> 01:05:54.163

finishes that tank.

01:05:54.563 --> 01:05:57.063
Oh, alright. Kids you'll be

Oh wow.

01:06:26.262 --> 01:06:27.463
In the wate...

01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:29.532
Late!

01:06:34.202 --> 01:06:36.002
This look is great for you.

01:06:36.004 --> 01:06:37.005
Total barney.

01:06:37.907 --> 01:06:38.974

01:06:39.573 --> 01:06:40.842

Sweet.

01:06:44.547 --> 01:06:45.548

01:06:45.915 --> 01:06:47.015
I'm barn doggin'!

01:06:50.885 --> 01:06:52.051
Hey cap.

01:06:52.053 --> 01:06:54.056
Look at that man you really
think all that necessary?

01:06:54.655 --> 01:06:56.622
- Hey cap man.
- No Moe!

01:06:56.624 --> 01:06:57.626
No.

01:06:58.025 --> 01:06:59.126
Enough is enough.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.160
This dolphin has been taking too
much

01:07:01.162 --> 01:07:02.196
money out of our pocket.

01:07:10.603 --> 01:07:11.605
Cannonball!

01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:15.876
Yeah!

01:07:19.612 --> 01:07:21.313
You're the cannonball master.

01:07:21.315 --> 01:07:22.746
Well it's a talent,

01:07:22.749 --> 01:07:25.151
some people got it some people
don't.

01:07:35.195 --> 01:07:36.197
I found a pod!

01:07:37.264 --> 01:07:38.328
- What?
- Go Echo

01:07:38.330 --> 01:07:39.799
the pod is that way!

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.168
Their inside the reef, look
look!

01:07:43.737 --> 01:07:45.235
- Really?
- I don't know.

01:07:45.237 --> 01:07:47.605
That pod seems a little too
far for this guy to hear them.

01:07:47.607 --> 01:07:48.876
We gotta get closer!

01:07:49.174 --> 01:07:49.975
But what if...

01:07:50.876 --> 01:07:52.776
What if he wants to stay here
with us.

01:07:52.778 --> 01:07:55.180
I don't want him to go he's my
friend.

01:07:55.982 --> 01:07:58.652
You guys are gonna have to say
goodbye some time.

01:08:00.954 --> 01:08:03.757
Do you want to leave him
here without his pod?

01:08:13.698 --> 01:08:15.366
I hate to break it to the both
of you but,

01:08:15.368 --> 01:08:16.937
with the way that pods moving,

01:08:17.136 --> 01:08:18.572
they'll be long gone soon.

01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:20.305
Is my dad coming back up?

01:08:20.839 --> 01:08:21.841
Uh, 35 minutes.

01:08:23.709 --> 01:08:24.875
Well, I'm done.

01:08:27.078 --> 01:08:29.648
It's okay buddy I'll be back.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:35.321
Later Collard.

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:37.156
- Uh hey!
- Yup?

01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:39.055
Don't go any further than that.

01:08:39.058 --> 01:08:40.894
Nova is gonna kill me if I lose
track of you.

01:08:41.225 --> 01:08:42.227
Sure.

01:08:43.126 --> 01:08:45.631
Come on Sky, let's get some
lemonade.

01:08:47.366 --> 01:08:48.663
What are you doing?

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:50.267
I know how to get echo close to
the Pod.

01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:52.136
- Wait how?
- We need a boat!

01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:00.676
No one ever asks if I want
lemonade.

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:03.383
- There it is down there!
- Okay, let's go! Go, go, go, go, go!

01:09:05.383 --> 01:09:06.716
Okay, all clear.

01:09:06.718 --> 01:09:08.053
- You get in I'll get...
- Cleats!

01:09:11.388 --> 01:09:12.390
You in? Okay.

01:09:14.091 --> 01:09:15.928
You know what you're doing?

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.060
Are you sure you know what
you're doing?

01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:22.066
Okay. Life jackets.

01:09:22.432 --> 01:09:23.430
Plug. Oil.

01:09:23.433 --> 01:09:25.937
I think dad said we could forget
about that one.

01:09:26.136 --> 01:09:28.107
Uhm, push throttle to start.

01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:33.276
And, punch it?

01:09:36.913 --> 01:09:38.412
That's all I remember.

01:09:38.415 --> 01:09:39.216
Punch it.

01:09:41.185 --> 01:09:42.751
Pods in the reef!

01:09:42.752 --> 01:09:44.223
The pods in the reef! Is someone
there?

01:09:44.821 --> 01:09:47.124
Someone copy the Pod is in the
reef!

01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:49.894
Alright, alright, I'm on my way!

01:09:50.428 --> 01:09:51.859
Ah here we go!

01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:54.231
We gotta reset
the chimes on the west opening.

01:09:59.035 --> 01:10:00.038
Not bad dude.

01:10:04.141 --> 01:10:05.977
You're a real boat captain.

01:10:06.342 --> 01:10:07.344
Hey! Hello!

01:10:08.010 --> 01:10:09.012
- Anybody!
- Collard!

01:10:09.279 --> 01:10:10.879
Nova here, we're just finishing
up.

01:10:10.881 --> 01:10:11.883
- What's up?
- Listen!

01:10:13.016 --> 01:10:14.115
They found out Echo has been
chewing up the traps!

01:10:14.117 --> 01:10:15.116
What?

01:10:15.118 --> 01:10:16.386
Naz is after Echo!

01:10:22.124 --> 01:10:23.126
Echo!

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.193
Run!

01:10:25.195 --> 01:10:26.227
Echo!

01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:27.230
Echo!

01:10:27.463 --> 01:10:29.734
Echo! Echo!

01:10:29.932 --> 01:10:31.133
- Come on!
- Echo!

01:10:31.767 --> 01:10:32.769
- Echo!
- Echo!

01:10:33.336 --> 01:10:34.438
- Echo!
- Come on!

01:10:35.105 --> 01:10:36.207
Pod's that way!

01:10:37.273 --> 01:10:38.275
Echo!

01:10:45.815 --> 01:10:47.417
These crusty old trappers

01:10:48.216 --> 01:10:50.853
they get away with anything they
want.

01:10:51.154 --> 01:10:52.955
They never have to pay the
price.

01:10:53.823 --> 01:10:56.727
They think they own this ocean,
they don't.

01:10:58.461 --> 01:11:00.030
They can be dangerous.

01:11:02.498 --> 01:11:03.500
We can,

01:11:04.433 --> 01:11:06.068
we can make sure they don't hurt
Echo but,

01:11:06.368 --> 01:11:09.105
we shouldn't mess with their
livelihood.

01:11:09.437 --> 01:11:11.905
I'm not gonna sink their boat I
was just gonna teach them a lesson.

01:11:11.907 --> 01:11:13.173
No not like this.

01:11:13.175 --> 01:11:16.246
- Please don't.
- Nova, they're gonna kill him.

01:11:19.047 --> 01:11:21.983
Clint, no one messes with
these guys.

01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:24.486
You don't want to put Naz in a
corner.

01:11:25.086 --> 01:11:28.525
And they're out there right
now hunting for Echo.

01:11:30.892 --> 01:11:32.525
We're his only protectors.

01:11:32.528 --> 01:11:35.163
If we don't do something, no one
will.

01:11:35.898 --> 01:11:37.166
Alright let's do it.

01:11:38.032 --> 01:11:40.201
These boats are equipped to
locate them.

01:11:41.269 --> 01:11:42.270
Let's take it.

01:11:50.444 --> 01:11:51.447
Echo!

01:11:52.613 --> 01:11:53.815
Echo!

01:11:59.586 --> 01:12:00.790
Echo!

01:12:02.290 --> 01:12:03.291
Echo!

01:12:03.891 --> 01:12:04.692
Echo!

01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:07.363
We gotta get you to your family
okay!

01:12:07.961 --> 01:12:08.995
Follow us!

01:12:08.997 --> 01:12:10.199
Sky! I lost them!

Where's he at?

01:17:46.258 --> 01:17:47.261
Do you see him?

01:17:48.694 --> 01:17:49.697
Where is he?

01:18:17.324 --> 01:18:19.559
Ah, sit up, sit up, sit up.

01:18:23.394 --> 01:18:24.460
Move, move, move.

01:18:24.462 --> 01:18:26.167
Clear out give him room.

01:18:31.769 --> 01:18:33.406

01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:38.442

01:18:38.444 --> 01:18:41.548
you were trying to kill
just saved your life.

01:18:52.358 --> 01:18:53.359
I'm sorry.

01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:55.527
I just, I just...

01:18:57.763 --> 01:19:00.500
I know you're just trying
to protect your livelihood.

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:06.371
But we've been trying to get
Echo back out in the open water.

01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:08.739
And away from y'alls traps.

01:19:08.741 --> 01:19:09.742
Echo?

01:19:10.908 --> 01:19:12.911
The dolphin, his name is Echo.

01:19:24.789 --> 01:19:25.791
Thanks Echo.

01:19:27.825 --> 01:19:29.229
For saving my life.

01:19:35.933 --> 01:19:36.935
Guys!

01:19:38.001 --> 01:19:39.905
- What about the pod!
- Yeah Skylar found the pod!

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.905
We were trying to get the pod!

01:19:43.907 --> 01:19:44.976
You found a pod.

01:19:54.551 --> 01:19:56.717
We were trying
to get him out of y'alls,

01:19:56.719 --> 01:19:59.289
way and stop messing with your
traps.

01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:02.627
We were trying to return him to
a pod.

01:20:08.731 --> 01:20:09.766
We hunt snapper,

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.304
and grouper on the bottom of
the ocean floor.

01:20:15.838 --> 01:20:18.575
I don't think finding a pod of
dolphins,

01:20:19.709 --> 01:20:21.044
should be any harder.

01:20:23.879 --> 01:20:24.882

01:20:25.081 --> 01:20:26.517

01:20:49.971 --> 01:20:52.375
Sky hang tight!

01:20:53.543 --> 01:20:55.779

01:21:01.417 --> 01:21:02.686

01:21:27.074 --> 01:21:28.340

01:21:33.149 --> 01:21:34.350
Okay.

The pod will take him from here.

01:22:14.788 --> 01:22:16.692
I have a family that cares about
me

01:22:16.925 --> 01:22:18.793
more than anything else in the
world.

01:22:19.594 --> 01:22:20.596
