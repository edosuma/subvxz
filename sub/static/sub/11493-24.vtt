<i>Previously on:</i>

00:02.342 --> 00:04.059
So, what have you
been up to?

00:04.061 --> 00:05.844
I started a new
software company

00:05.846 --> 00:07.612
with my old partner
Billy Stanhope.

00:07.614 --> 00:09.797
You really think we can finally
build the electric suitcase?

00:09.799 --> 00:11.516
Yes. We have the technology now.

00:11.518 --> 00:13.134
Something you should know.

00:13.136 --> 00:14.568
It's about your ex-wife.

00:14.571 --> 00:15.687
What, Bridget?

00:15.689 --> 00:17.272
Yeah. I'm, uh...

00:17.274 --> 00:18.907
kind of sleeping with her.

00:18.909 --> 00:20.659
What?
Wait! Hey!

00:23.663 --> 00:25.046
Morning.

00:25.048 --> 00:28.149
It's 2:00 p.m.

00:28.151 --> 00:29.150
So?

00:29.152 --> 00:30.835
It's Saturday; I slept in.

00:30.837 --> 00:32.704
It's Sunday.

00:32.706 --> 00:34.372
Really?

00:34.374 --> 00:35.757
That's disturbing.

00:35.759 --> 00:39.494
So what did you do last night
that you had to sleep all day?

00:39.496 --> 00:40.845
One thing at a time.

00:40.847 --> 00:43.798
I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to Saturday.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.184
Jake, you're gonna graduate
high school in a few days.

00:46.186 --> 00:47.302
Don't you think it's time

00:47.304 --> 00:48.603
to start getting
your life together?

00:48.605 --> 00:50.138
I will if you will.

00:50.140 --> 00:51.640
What?

00:51.642 --> 00:54.008
I will certainly
consider that, Father.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.193
This is serious.

00:55.195 --> 00:56.978
You will never amount to
anything if you sleep all day.

00:56.980 --> 00:58.179
Morning.

01:02.818 --> 01:04.786
I'm sorry, I was distracted

01:04.788 --> 01:06.621
by the naked billionaire
that just woke up.

01:06.623 --> 01:10.208
Shut up and eat
your damn cereal.

01:10.210 --> 01:12.577

01:29.230 --> 01:33.866
Man, I did not think Jeremy
was ever gonna stop talking.

01:33.868 --> 01:35.235
Yeah.

01:35.237 --> 01:38.704
That guy really puts the "dict"
in "valedictorian."

01:38.706 --> 01:41.391
Thinks he's so great just
'cause he's going to Harvard.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.926
Where is Harvard anyway?

01:42.928 --> 01:46.062
Dude, didn't you learn
anything in high school?

01:46.064 --> 01:48.898
It's the capital of Connecticut.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.883
Are you sure?

01:50.885 --> 01:51.901
Yeah.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.419
Harvard, Connecticut.

01:54.822 --> 01:56.522
What'd you think
was the capital of Connecticut?

01:56.524 --> 01:58.557
"C."

02:01.446 --> 02:02.912
You're an idiot.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.897
I don't know why
I hang out with you.

02:04.899 --> 02:05.932
'Cause you're gay.

02:05.934 --> 02:07.250
Well, what does that make you?

02:07.252 --> 02:09.502
Attractive.

02:11.839 --> 02:14.624
So are your parents giving you
a hard time about your "future"?

02:14.626 --> 02:15.741
Oh, yeah.

02:15.743 --> 02:17.010
Both my mom and my dad.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.428
I'm sick of hearing it.

02:18.430 --> 02:21.681
Yeah. "If you're not going to
college, you need to get a job""

02:21.683 --> 02:24.133
Where do they
get this stuff?

02:24.135 --> 02:26.302
Beats me.

02:29.556 --> 02:31.757
So what are we gonna do?

02:31.759 --> 02:33.860
About what?

02:33.862 --> 02:35.612
Our future.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.430
Oh.

02:39.266 --> 02:42.752
I could go for
some frozen yogurt.

02:42.754 --> 02:44.070
Good idea, man.

02:44.072 --> 02:45.121
Let's go.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.490
Should we take
our robes off?

02:47.492 --> 02:48.658
No, no, leave them on.

02:48.660 --> 02:50.877
They'll attract smart chicks.

02:53.330 --> 02:55.999
Come on, Judith.
He's your son too.

02:56.001 --> 02:59.802
I have videotape of him
shooting out of your body.

03:00.671 --> 03:02.422
Yes, I've talked to him

03:02.424 --> 03:05.224
about his lack of plans,
but it's like talking to a wall.

03:05.226 --> 03:09.646
A very good-natured,
but dense wall.

03:09.648 --> 03:14.100
Of course I'm concerned,
but what do you want me to do?

03:14.102 --> 03:17.470
No, I'm not gonna ask Walden
to give him a job.

03:18.772 --> 03:21.024
Because it would
be an imposition.

03:21.026 --> 03:25.662
Yes, more of an imposition
than me living there for free.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.948
Okay, okay, if it'll get you
to shut up, I'll ask him.

03:30.918 --> 03:34.320
She's never
gonna shut up.

03:34.322 --> 03:35.321
Okay, okay.

03:35.323 --> 03:36.655
Good-bye, Judith.

03:37.792 --> 03:40.677
I am so thankful
I have you in my life.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.795
What about my son?

03:42.797 --> 03:44.330
What about him?

03:44.332 --> 03:47.166
You're gonna ask Walden for a
job for Jake, but not Eldridge?

03:49.002 --> 03:50.436
Of course not.

03:50.438 --> 03:53.456
I was just gonna hold Eldridge
back to sweeten the deal.

03:58.946 --> 04:01.264
I have a question.

04:01.266 --> 04:02.598
What?

04:02.600 --> 04:05.818
Why didn't you order
adjustable chairs?

04:05.820 --> 04:08.204
I did.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.189
Mine's adjustable.

04:10.191 --> 04:11.290
Well, wait.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.691
How'd you do that?

04:12.693 --> 04:15.411
This lever right here.

04:15.413 --> 04:17.245
I don't have a lever.

04:17.248 --> 04:18.664
Hmm?

04:18.666 --> 04:21.000
Well, that's too bad,
you being so short and all.

04:21.002 --> 04:24.253
You did this to get back at me.

04:24.255 --> 04:25.671
I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:25.673 --> 04:27.557
For sleeping with your ex-wife.

04:27.559 --> 04:30.660
Do you really think
that I am so petty

04:30.662 --> 04:34.680
that I would pay a chair
manufacturer an extra $480

04:34.682 --> 04:39.018
to remove the adjustable
height feature?

04:39.020 --> 04:42.388
That is crazy talk.

04:43.574 --> 04:46.993
How's everything down there
at the Lollipop Guild?

04:51.081 --> 04:52.665
Hey, guys.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.950
Am I interrupting?

04:53.952 --> 04:54.834
Hey, Alan.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.452
Just thought
I'd bring you by

04:56.454 --> 04:58.921
a little office-warming
dieffenbachia.

04:58.923 --> 05:01.340
Ah, thank you.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.292
Looks like you got the place
up and running.

05:03.294 --> 05:04.544
We're getting there.

05:04.546 --> 05:05.911
Electric Suitcase, Inc.

05:05.913 --> 05:09.748
Very, very impressive.

05:11.218 --> 05:12.835
What can I do for you?

05:12.837 --> 05:15.388
Oh, nothing. I just came
to drop off my gift

05:15.390 --> 05:16.722
and wish you well.

05:16.724 --> 05:18.024
Okay.

05:19.309 --> 05:21.060
Okay, well, I'll get out
of your hair.

05:21.062 --> 05:23.362
Uh, nice to see
you again.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.448
Yep. Always thrill.

05:26.617 --> 05:27.817
Oh, there is one thing.

05:27.819 --> 05:30.203
Here we go.
Here we go.

05:30.205 --> 05:33.372
Um, you know Jake
just graduated high school.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.491
Oh, hey, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the ceremony.

05:35.493 --> 05:37.293
Oh, don't be silly.
No one expected you to.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.444
You know what?
Here...

05:38.446 --> 05:41.497
why don't you give this
to him for me.

05:41.499 --> 05:43.299
Ooh, a hundred dollars.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.818
I will make sure he gets this.

05:48.672 --> 05:51.424
What? I-I don't
even know the kid.

05:51.426 --> 05:52.925
Oh, of course not.

05:52.927 --> 05:55.061
Um, anyway, I was
just wondering, um,

05:55.063 --> 05:58.130
since you've started
this exciting venture

05:58.132 --> 05:59.632
and obviously you're hiring,

05:59.634 --> 06:02.318
that there might be
an opportunity here for Jake.

06:03.136 --> 06:04.604
He's not going to college?

06:04.606 --> 06:06.739
Not unless he's
delivering pizzas.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.357
Uh, probably true,

06:08.359 --> 06:09.975
but he has a good heart,

06:09.977 --> 06:12.311
and I'm afraid if I
can't find him a decent job,

06:12.313 --> 06:13.996
he might have to sell it.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.115
Okay, listen, Alan, I'm sorry.

06:16.117 --> 06:17.533
I-I like Jake,

06:17.535 --> 06:20.953
but I just don't think
we have anything for him here.

06:20.955 --> 06:22.205
Oh, oh, okay.

06:22.207 --> 06:24.423
I understand.
You know, he's just my kid.

06:24.425 --> 06:25.791
Our future. But, um,

06:25.793 --> 06:28.461
but thanks anyway.

06:28.463 --> 06:29.679
Oh, wait, wait.
Hold it, hold it.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.013
Yeah? Yeah?

06:31.015 --> 06:34.050
Does he know anything
about computers at all?

06:34.052 --> 06:36.602
Not per se,
but he is eager to learn.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.438
He's like a sponge when it comes
to soaking up information.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.008
No, he isn't.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.343
Will you at least give me
the sponge part?

06:44.345 --> 06:46.028
Yeah, if you lay him
on a wet spot,

06:46.030 --> 06:47.947
he might absorb liquid.

06:49.015 --> 06:50.733
Why are you being
such a jerk, man?

06:50.735 --> 06:52.068
Let's give
the boy a shot.

06:52.070 --> 06:53.286
Billy,

06:53.288 --> 06:55.488
I've seen this kid spend
an entire afternoon

06:55.490 --> 06:58.691
smoking dope and trying
to lick his own nipples.

06:58.693 --> 07:02.328
Who amongst us
hasn't... done...

07:02.330 --> 07:05.498
Look, we will...
we will take him on, okay?

07:05.500 --> 07:08.501
Billy...
He'll be my responsibility.

07:08.503 --> 07:10.086
Oh, thank you so much.
You will not regret it.

07:10.088 --> 07:13.839
Yes, you will.
I will send him right over.

07:13.841 --> 07:15.141
Oh, one more thing,

07:15.143 --> 07:17.426
uh, my girlfriend's son
needs a job too,

07:17.428 --> 07:18.844
but you're gonna love him,
he's...

07:18.846 --> 07:20.229
blonde. Bye.

07:22.332 --> 07:24.383
Okay, I'm telling you
right now,

07:24.385 --> 07:26.986
this is a bad idea.

07:29.072 --> 07:30.573
How did you do that?

07:30.575 --> 07:33.025
I don't know what
you're talking about.

07:38.732 --> 07:40.199
Okay, fellas...

07:40.201 --> 07:41.867
this is the heart and soul

07:41.869 --> 07:43.536
of The Electric Suitcase.

07:43.538 --> 07:45.070
300 state of the art,

07:45.072 --> 07:46.756
high bandwidth servers

07:46.758 --> 07:48.574
all working
in tandem.

07:48.576 --> 07:50.176
Cool.
Awesome.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.427
Any questions so far?

07:51.429 --> 07:52.911
Uh, yeah.
Is there a cafeteria

07:52.913 --> 07:54.513
or do we order in?

07:55.766 --> 07:57.967
There's a cafeteria
on the 14th floor.

07:57.969 --> 07:59.685
Oh. Cool.
I got a question.

07:59.687 --> 08:00.386
Yes?

08:00.388 --> 08:01.920
Do they have donuts?

08:03.089 --> 08:05.057
Was I lying?

08:05.059 --> 08:08.027
I don't know if I have donuts.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.446
That's okay.
It's not a deal-breaker.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.697
Glad to hear it.

08:11.699 --> 08:12.949
Uh, okay, guys...

08:12.951 --> 08:15.284
all you have to do
between now

08:15.286 --> 08:16.786
and 8:00 tomorrow morning,

08:16.788 --> 08:20.990
is watch the lights
on these servers, all right?

08:20.992 --> 08:22.208
If a green goes to red,

08:22.210 --> 08:23.926
it means the drive
is about to fail

08:23.928 --> 08:25.077
so all you do...

08:25.079 --> 08:27.213
you pop it out

08:27.215 --> 08:28.881
and you replace it

08:28.883 --> 08:31.283
with a fresh one
from right here.

08:31.285 --> 08:33.052
Got it. No problem.
All right.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.855
Oh, and there's no smoking dope
in this building.

08:35.857 --> 08:37.289
No, sir.
Absolutely not.

08:37.291 --> 08:39.808
Not <i>inside</i> the building.

08:39.811 --> 08:42.094
Or outside the building.

08:42.096 --> 08:43.663
How about the roof?

08:43.664 --> 08:44.930
No.

08:44.932 --> 08:46.832
What about before
we come to work?

08:46.834 --> 08:47.833
No!

08:47.835 --> 08:49.368
What about brownies?

08:49.370 --> 08:52.405
There's no pot, period!

08:52.407 --> 08:55.808
No brownies, no God, no roof,
no outside, no inside.

08:55.810 --> 08:57.910
No problem.
All right.

08:58.912 --> 09:00.062
Good.

09:00.064 --> 09:02.331
Oh, and we just want
to take this opportunity

09:02.333 --> 09:04.667
to thank you both for
this great opportunity.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.003
'Cause let's face it,
it is an opportunity.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.505
And it's great.
Opportunity.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.425
Remember, this is on you.

09:13.844 --> 09:14.844
Oh, and on a personal note,

09:14.846 --> 09:16.178
thank you
for the graduation money.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.980
It's my pleasure.

09:17.982 --> 09:20.516
A kid my age can always
use an extra 50 bucks.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.390
You know,

09:27.392 --> 09:29.975
I kind of like this whole
"working for a living" thing.

09:29.977 --> 09:31.427
It feels good, you know?

09:31.429 --> 09:32.778
Responsible, grownup.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.130
Absolutely.

09:34.132 --> 09:37.116
All right, we have
successfully downloaded

09:37.118 --> 09:39.735
40,000 hours of porn.

09:39.737 --> 09:42.488
That's a lot to watch
two minutes at a time.

09:42.490 --> 09:44.306
I just hope Billy
and Walden don't notice

09:44.308 --> 09:46.058
that we're using
their hard drives.

09:46.060 --> 09:48.828
Don't worry. I've labeled
every movie "personal."

09:48.830 --> 09:50.463
Oh. Good thinking.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.882
Oh, red light. I got it.

09:56.202 --> 09:57.520
Nicely done.

09:57.522 --> 09:59.872
We got this job nailed, my man.
Yeah.

09:59.874 --> 10:01.006
And the best part is,

10:01.008 --> 10:03.075
we are in on the ground floor
of the company.

10:03.077 --> 10:05.094
Oh, another one.

10:05.096 --> 10:06.429
Allow me.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.848
Maybe they'll give us
stock options and we'll be rich.

10:08.850 --> 10:10.266
What exactly is a stock option?

10:10.268 --> 10:12.485
It's a call option on the
common stock of a company,

10:12.487 --> 10:14.603
issued as a form
of cash compensation.

10:14.605 --> 10:15.888
If the company stock rises,

10:15.890 --> 10:17.490
the holder of the option

10:17.492 --> 10:20.076
generally experiences
a direct financial benefit.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.178
Where'd you learn that?

10:22.180 --> 10:25.230
Wikipedia.
It's not just for term papers.

10:25.232 --> 10:28.250
The point is,
we're gonna be rich.

10:28.252 --> 10:29.835
Oh, another one.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.404
Cool. So we'll have
our own planes

10:32.406 --> 10:34.507
and yachts and chicks.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.375
And tons of pot.
Chicks with pot.

10:36.377 --> 10:37.593
Chicks with pot in bikinis.

10:37.595 --> 10:38.878
Naked chicks with pot.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.045
On a yacht.

10:40.047 --> 10:42.231
I like that a lot.

10:42.233 --> 10:43.299
Uh-oh.

10:43.301 --> 10:44.984
That's not good.

10:44.986 --> 10:46.993
Yeah. Why are they all
going bad at the same time?

10:47.018 --> 10:48.054
I don't know.

10:48.055 --> 10:49.805
It's like there's
some sort of virus.

10:49.807 --> 10:52.090
Like the kind you get
when you download too much...

10:52.092 --> 10:54.093
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.212
Maybe we should call Billy!

10:56.214 --> 10:58.096
No, we can do this!

11:00.050 --> 11:01.600
Okay, we can't do this.

11:01.602 --> 11:03.886
Call Billy!
Call Billy!

11:03.888 --> 11:05.404
Hello?

11:05.406 --> 11:07.123
Billy, it's Jake.

11:11.277 --> 11:13.329
I just want to start once again

11:13.331 --> 11:15.915
by saying how grateful we are
for this opportunity.

11:15.917 --> 11:17.299
It's great.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:33.324 --> 11:36.893
How did this happen?

11:36.895 --> 11:39.111
Oh, I... I don't know.

11:39.113 --> 11:42.732
Well, faulty wiring
or, uh, cheap hardware...

11:42.734 --> 11:44.400
Definitely not
a porn virus.

11:44.402 --> 11:45.401
Shut up.

11:45.403 --> 11:46.702
How could you guys do this?

11:46.704 --> 11:48.537
I went out on a limb for you.

11:48.539 --> 11:49.538
I believed in you.

11:49.540 --> 11:50.522
Well, thank you.

11:50.524 --> 11:52.691
It was... it was a
wonderful opportunity.

11:52.693 --> 11:54.043
Oh, great opportunity.

11:56.663 --> 11:59.048
So, when do we get paid?

12:01.002 --> 12:02.084
Okay.

12:02.086 --> 12:04.337
Yeah, you can't.
I know their parents.

12:07.674 --> 12:09.675
Hey. What are you guys
doing here?

12:09.677 --> 12:12.395
I thought your shift
didn't end till 8:00 a.m.

12:12.397 --> 12:13.729
Well, we got done early.

12:13.731 --> 12:15.398
Oh. Everything go okay?

12:15.400 --> 12:16.682
I was kind of worried

12:16.684 --> 12:18.868
you might burn the whole place
down or something.

12:18.870 --> 12:21.821
Well, it wasn't "or something."

12:26.843 --> 12:29.845
How am I supposed to find jobs
in the next 24 hours?

12:29.847 --> 12:31.280
Beats me.

12:31.282 --> 12:32.915
It's like our parents
are clueless

12:32.917 --> 12:34.934
about how bad
the economy is.

12:34.936 --> 12:37.086
Yeah.

12:37.971 --> 12:39.372
You know what,

12:39.374 --> 12:41.374
instead of working
for someone else,

12:41.376 --> 12:43.209
we should start
our own business.

12:43.211 --> 12:44.877
I like that.

12:44.879 --> 12:47.546
We could find some
adventure capitalists

12:47.548 --> 12:50.099
and become, um--
what do you call--

12:50.101 --> 12:51.600
entrepraneers.

12:51.602 --> 12:53.886
Yeah. It's not like we
don't have our own good idea.

12:53.888 --> 12:55.604
We have great ideas.

12:58.308 --> 13:02.111
Hey, maybe we can put other
food on a stick and sell it.

13:02.113 --> 13:05.698
Yeah. Pizza on a stick.

13:05.700 --> 13:06.598
Pizza sticks.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.266
Pie.

13:07.268 --> 13:08.434
Pie sticks.

13:08.436 --> 13:09.568
Fish.

13:09.570 --> 13:13.272
Yeah, what are we
going to call those?

13:13.274 --> 13:15.274
Fish-sicles!

13:15.276 --> 13:16.625
Genius!

13:16.627 --> 13:17.793
Yeah.

13:17.795 --> 13:19.578
Excuse me.

13:19.770 --> 13:21.104
Did I hear you guys say

13:21.106 --> 13:22.438
you're looking for jobs?

13:22.440 --> 13:23.590
Yeah.

13:23.592 --> 13:24.991
Why?

13:41.191 --> 13:43.192
Maybe it's me.

13:43.194 --> 13:45.101
I'm an idiot magnet.

13:45.103 --> 13:46.653
Hey.

13:50.391 --> 13:52.876
Yup.

13:54.128 --> 13:55.016
Hi.

13:55.017 --> 13:56.183
How you doing?

13:56.185 --> 13:57.718
Not so good.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.053
Yeah, yeah, we heard,
and we're so, so sorry.

14:00.055 --> 14:01.405
So, so very sorry.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.640
Yeah, well, thank God
the files are backed up

14:03.642 --> 14:05.592
and insurance will cover
most of the damage.

14:05.594 --> 14:06.777
That's great news!

14:06.779 --> 14:07.928
Yes. Phew!

14:11.232 --> 14:16.487
You do realize that
your children are not normal.

14:16.489 --> 14:20.440
Well, yeah, but, you know,
what's normal?

14:20.442 --> 14:21.959
And-and in Jake's defense,

14:21.961 --> 14:23.627
he never would have done
anything like this

14:23.629 --> 14:25.746
unless, uh, you know.

14:27.917 --> 14:30.083
"You know" what, Alan?

14:30.085 --> 14:32.219
Well, I didn't want to,
you know, say anything

14:32.221 --> 14:34.671
but, uh, but clearly there's
a bad influence involved here.

14:34.673 --> 14:36.673
I mean, I don't want
to point any fingers,

14:36.675 --> 14:39.626
but, uh, his name rhymes
with "smeldridge."

14:41.046 --> 14:43.397
Oh, my God.

14:43.399 --> 14:45.148
You-you can't be serious.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.484
My son had never been in trouble
in his life

14:47.486 --> 14:49.102
until he met your son.

14:49.104 --> 14:50.404
Never been in trouble?

14:50.406 --> 14:51.572
He tried
to counterfeit money

14:51.574 --> 14:53.407
with a computer
and an inkjet printer.

14:53.409 --> 14:55.609
The government dropped
the charges.

14:55.611 --> 14:57.611
Only because
there's no such thing

14:57.613 --> 14:59.479
as a $25 bill.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.448
Yeah? Yeah? Well,

15:01.450 --> 15:03.083
well, what about when Jake stole
your brother's Mercedes

15:03.085 --> 15:05.202
and lost it in Topanga Canyon?

15:05.204 --> 15:06.670
He didn't steal it.
He borrowed it.

15:06.672 --> 15:08.822
And he was only driving it
because my brother was drunk

15:08.824 --> 15:11.291
and someone had to take
his hooker home.

15:12.677 --> 15:15.796
In Topanga Canyon,
which is where she lived.

15:15.798 --> 15:17.681
You are always making excuses
for him.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.066
And you don't excuse Eldridge?

15:19.068 --> 15:21.051
Hey, he went through
a very rough divorce.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.269
And Jake didn't?

15:22.271 --> 15:24.855
Well, at least your
wife traded up.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.139
Wh-what is that supposed
to mean?

15:26.141 --> 15:28.692
Really?
That was too subtle for you?

15:30.612 --> 15:33.146
Hey, everybody, good news.

15:33.148 --> 15:34.982
You don't have to worry
about us finding work.

15:34.984 --> 15:36.283
You-you got a job?

15:36.285 --> 15:37.818
Yeah. It's not
just a job though.

15:37.820 --> 15:40.120
It's an adventure.

15:40.122 --> 15:42.039
What?

15:42.041 --> 15:45.191
We're gonna be
all we can be.

15:47.745 --> 15:49.896
Oh, oh, no-no, you didn't.

15:49.898 --> 15:51.131
We didn't what?

15:51.133 --> 15:52.549
Join the Army.

15:52.551 --> 15:55.535
Yeah, we joined the Army.
How'd you know?

15:57.171 --> 16:00.641
You need to listen to me.

16:02.226 --> 16:05.495
They are not normal.

16:12.770 --> 16:14.855
Uh, hiya.

16:14.857 --> 16:16.273
Hi.

16:16.275 --> 16:17.491
Looking for a new career?

16:17.493 --> 16:19.743
Um, I'm 44 years old.

16:19.745 --> 16:20.911
That's okay.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.729
Today's Army is all-inclusive.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.999
You can be as old and as gay
as you want.

16:26.001 --> 16:28.919
Uh, well,
that's-that's good to know.

16:28.921 --> 16:31.421
Um, uh, but I-I actually wanted
to talk to you

16:31.423 --> 16:33.674
about my son, Jake Harper.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.376
Harper. Harper.

16:36.378 --> 16:38.845
Oh, yeah,
wants to be a drone pilot.

16:38.847 --> 16:39.930
Yeah, he told me.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.264
He thinks it's like
a video game.

16:41.266 --> 16:42.466
Oh, it is.

16:42.468 --> 16:43.917
It's exactly like a video game.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.436
Except we blow up real people.

16:46.438 --> 16:49.356
Yeah, actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

16:49.358 --> 16:50.390
Um,

16:50.392 --> 16:51.558
I love my son,

16:51.560 --> 16:52.809
uh, but more importantly,

16:52.811 --> 16:55.145
I love my country,

16:55.147 --> 16:58.148
uh, which is why
I don't think my son

16:58.150 --> 17:01.101
should have access
to flying bombs.

17:02.286 --> 17:04.604
Or really any kind of weapon.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.106
I mean, between you and me,

17:06.108 --> 17:08.492
I've seen him try to pick up
spilled food with a fork

17:08.493 --> 17:10.327
and stab himself in the leg.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.079
And not just once.

17:12.080 --> 17:15.415
I understand your concern,
but our training is unsurpassed.

17:15.416 --> 17:17.300
We take boys
and turn them into men.

17:17.301 --> 17:19.118
I know you think that...

17:20.471 --> 17:22.955
...but you don't know him
like I do.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.558
He's 18, right?
Yeah.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.977
Not currently on probation
or under indictment?

17:26.979 --> 17:29.229
No.
Is this his signature?

17:29.231 --> 17:30.313
Yeah.

17:30.315 --> 17:31.481
Then if he passes the physical,

17:31.483 --> 17:34.434
he's signed, stamped,
and off to camp.

17:35.269 --> 17:37.938
I see.

17:37.940 --> 17:40.273
Oh, look, al-Qaeda!

17:41.142 --> 17:43.493
It's just a copy!

17:44.696 --> 17:46.329
Hey, guys, you like video games?

17:51.252 --> 17:53.036
Congratulations, Jake.

17:53.038 --> 17:55.756
I know I'm only your stepdad,
but I'm real proud of you.

17:55.758 --> 17:57.541
Thanks, Herb.
Were you ever in the Army?

17:57.543 --> 18:00.177
Well, the KISS Army.

18:02.130 --> 18:03.964
But I don't think
that really counts.

18:03.966 --> 18:06.133
You think Mom's ever gonna
stop crying

18:06.135 --> 18:07.333
before I go?

18:08.620 --> 18:10.670
My guess is no.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.606
Don't worry, Mom.

18:12.608 --> 18:13.890
I'll be fine.

18:13.892 --> 18:15.025
I'm a grown man now.

18:15.027 --> 18:16.860
No, you're not.

18:16.862 --> 18:19.012
You're my bigheaded baby.

18:38.032 --> 18:39.633
So, Berta,
are you gonna miss me?

18:39.635 --> 18:41.418
Nah, why should I miss you?

18:41.420 --> 18:43.553
You're just an extra
toilet to clean.

18:43.555 --> 18:46.056
That is, when you
hit the toilet.

19:02.673 --> 19:05.192
Don't worry, Grandma.
I'll make you proud of me.

19:05.194 --> 19:08.411
I've always been proud
of you, darling.

19:08.413 --> 19:10.197
In my own way.

19:27.381 --> 19:29.382
Thanks for everything.

19:29.384 --> 19:32.469
Come here.

19:41.779 --> 19:43.396
Look at
the bright side, Dad.

19:43.398 --> 19:45.065
You won't have
to buy me clothes anymore.

19:45.067 --> 19:46.733
They're gonna give me
a dress uniform,

19:46.735 --> 19:49.602
a work uniform, and even one
for when I'm tired.

19:49.604 --> 19:51.204
What?

19:51.206 --> 19:53.740
Yeah, they call 'em "fatigues."

19:53.742 --> 19:56.442
I don't know why they just
wouldn't call 'em pajamas.

19:56.444 --> 19:59.045
Oh, my son, my son.

20:23.070 --> 20:25.655
You be a good boy,
and you do what you're told,

20:25.657 --> 20:27.490
and promise me
you'll be careful.

20:27.492 --> 20:28.942
Don't worry about me.

20:30.194 --> 20:33.446
Worry about
our nation's enemies.

20:37.168 --> 20:39.336
I am worried.

20:47.397 --> 20:48.680
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

20:48.682 --> 20:50.477
Come on, you lazy pukes!

20:50.480 --> 20:52.447
Move it! Move it! Move it!

20:52.449 --> 20:54.682
When do we start flying
the robot planes?

20:55.785 --> 20:57.368
I don't know.

20:57.370 --> 20:58.834
Maybe after lunch.
