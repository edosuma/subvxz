00:26.326 --> 00:29.705
<i>Deep in the Wuyi Mountains,
there laid a mysterious well</i>

00:29.796 --> 00:33.369
<i>which contained a powerful form of
chi known as the Golden Nectar.</i>

00:35.002 --> 00:37.744
<i>Lord Pi,
a renegade monk, learned</i>

00:37.838 --> 00:40.751
<i>whoever controlled the Golden
Nectar could gain immortality.</i>

00:42.075 --> 00:45.818
<i>So he pursued the prize
with a savage onslaught.</i>

00:47.214 --> 00:50.195
<i>The monks, who had protected the
source of chi for centuries,</i>

00:50.250 --> 00:52.161
<i>were not strong enough.</i>

00:53.320 --> 00:57.029
<i>But the Abbott,
a man of peace,
was prepared for war.</i>

00:59.526 --> 01:01.233
<i>The Gemini Killers.</i>

01:01.328 --> 01:03.740
<i>They delivered both
the element of surprise</i>

01:03.830 --> 01:07.573
<i>And the extreme force needed
to vanquish this dark enemy.</i>

01:12.039 --> 01:16.044
<i>Lord Pi had finally
overplayed his cosmic hand.</i>

01:16.109 --> 01:17.520
<i>That was 10 years ago.</i>

01:21.548 --> 01:24.222
<i>Now, legend has it
that the ghost of Lord Pi</i>

01:24.284 --> 01:26.127
<i>still haunts these
remote mountains,</i>

01:26.219 --> 01:28.699
<i>stealing chi from any
source he could find.</i>

01:35.796 --> 01:38.606
<i>They say Lord Buddha
laughs at the world,</i>

01:38.699 --> 01:41.612
<i>and I'm sure
he's laughing down at me.</i>

01:41.702 --> 01:46.378
<i>After leaving Jungle Village,
I decided to return
back to the monks.</i>

01:52.546 --> 01:54.822
<i>My challenge would
be to find peace,</i>

01:55.382 --> 01:57.328
<i>reawaken my chi</i>

01:57.417 --> 01:59.294
<i>and atone for my sins.</i>

02:02.155 --> 02:05.728
<i>Maybe this Golden Nectar
at the Wuyi mountain</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:08.136
<i>could help build
me a new future.</i>

02:08.228 --> 02:09.935
<i>Lord knows I need it.</i>

02:12.399 --> 02:16.506
<i>But even though you may try
to leave your past behind,</i>

02:16.603 --> 02:17.673
<i>in the end,</i>

02:19.940 --> 02:21.613
<i>it always finds you.</i>

02:53.440 --> 02:56.353
Whoever you are,
I don't have no
quarrel with you.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.155
Oh, but you do.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.556
You murdered my brother,
Silver Lion.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.120
I should have recognized
the stupid hairstyle.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.185
Kill him.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.653
Look.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.495
Look what he has
done to my daughter.

05:29.129 --> 05:33.305
What has this evil
spirit done to my angel?

05:34.935 --> 05:39.680
How many more will the ghost of
Lord Pi take before we stop him?

05:40.373 --> 05:41.545
You...

05:41.641 --> 05:43.951
You are the mayor
of this town!

05:44.010 --> 05:47.890
It's your responsibility
to protect our children!

05:49.549 --> 05:53.053
Master Ho! You didn't
protect her either.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.661
Such a pretty little thing.

05:57.791 --> 05:58.792
What a waste.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.705
Your grieving time's over.

06:06.666 --> 06:10.341
Get back to my mine before
my silver turns to dust.

06:13.707 --> 06:17.211
Okay, everybody.
Let's carry on.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.221
If we want Master Ho's
full cooperation

06:19.312 --> 06:21.155
in catching this
perverted demon,

06:21.214 --> 06:23.387
we must show him
our dedication.

07:29.649 --> 07:33.825
I hear you all think the
tools I provide are inadequate.

07:35.488 --> 07:40.335
You bastard maggots
of whoring mongrel dogs.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.303
Do you think this
is fit for the job?

07:46.099 --> 07:49.569
Do you think
this is a good tool?

07:50.837 --> 07:52.407
Well, let's see!
No!

07:54.074 --> 07:57.419
Who here thinks this
is not a good tool?

07:57.510 --> 08:00.957
A bad craftsman
blames his tools.

08:05.919 --> 08:10.265
All of you miners are
under contract to me!

08:10.924 --> 08:14.929
When you are in this mine,
you belong to me.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.466
If you're not convinced,

08:19.265 --> 08:21.211
I'll have the heads
of the five

08:21.301 --> 08:23.338
slowest miners today.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.147
Hey! Back to work!
Back to work, now!

08:45.892 --> 08:46.893
Stay back.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.631
What are you all
standing here for, huh?

08:48.695 --> 08:50.197
Get back to work!

08:50.296 --> 08:51.400
All of you!
Back to work.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.307
Will you trust me?
This is not the time.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.301
You.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.311
Outside with me.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.174
Now!

09:03.209 --> 09:04.313
Go!

09:11.217 --> 09:14.255
The Beetle Clan
are killing our men!

09:14.387 --> 09:15.866
We must stand up for ourselves.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.203
<i>We may not have the right
weapons, but we are ready.</i>

09:19.359 --> 09:21.339
I ask you, Li Kung,

09:21.394 --> 09:23.567
when do we take
the fight to these bastards?

09:25.732 --> 09:28.406
We must remain composed

09:28.501 --> 09:30.538
and only make our move
when everything is in place.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.181
Patience is
the key to victory.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.516
You've been preaching
patience for many months now.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.112
Where has that gotten us?

09:38.211 --> 09:40.020
Are you questioning
my leadership?

09:41.614 --> 09:44.094
Come on, let's go.
It's getting late.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.630
So, who among
you has a complaint tonight?

10:22.722 --> 10:25.635
Step forward and
challenge your opponent.

10:34.734 --> 10:38.238
From the shadows
you attack me?

10:39.506 --> 10:42.146
Master Ho will
challenge any of you

10:42.242 --> 10:44.813
to step in the ring
and fight me with honor.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.024
I'll take all of you on.

10:49.115 --> 10:53.257
Who among you wants
to take on Master Ho?

11:04.797 --> 11:06.276
Fools.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.774
Show me your face.

11:11.938 --> 11:15.112
I came here for you,
Master Ho.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.282
Let me tell you
how this will end.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.991
I've been hanged once.

11:23.783 --> 11:26.457
I've been bullwhipped twice.

11:28.655 --> 11:32.501
I've been shot at eight times.

11:32.559 --> 11:36.974
I've been dragged
behind horses 15 times.

11:37.030 --> 11:41.570
An overzealous whore in Manchukuo
chewed off my left testicle

11:41.668 --> 11:44.672
before I cut off her head

11:44.737 --> 11:46.717
and had my way with her.

11:49.742 --> 11:53.519
It takes more than
bad intent to kill me.

11:53.580 --> 11:56.584
The stars must align.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.698
The birds must swim.

12:00.820 --> 12:03.596
The fish must fly,

12:03.690 --> 12:06.170
before I will die.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.602
You see, gentlemen,

12:14.701 --> 12:18.205
you just walked
into a windstorm

12:18.271 --> 12:20.217
of flying elephant shit.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.185
Attack!

12:35.788 --> 12:36.858
No!

12:40.260 --> 12:41.398
Stop it!

12:48.601 --> 12:49.705
No!

13:30.810 --> 13:32.756
You feeling brave today, Kung?

13:33.946 --> 13:35.584
You keep your
gaze on your boots

13:35.648 --> 13:37.423
or you'll end up
like my friend here.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.289
Keep on walking.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.494
Someday, I'll shove
my shovel down his gullet.

13:44.590 --> 13:47.628
You keep your nose
on the grindstone, brother.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.503
He's itching
for a fight today.

14:08.147 --> 14:09.854
A girl is dead!

14:09.949 --> 14:12.156
They found another
girl near the village!

14:15.388 --> 14:17.163
A girl is dead!

14:20.960 --> 14:22.371
What's going on in here?

14:22.462 --> 14:23.634
Get back to work!

14:24.630 --> 14:26.541
Unless you want to
join your dead friend!

14:26.632 --> 14:29.476
The ghost of Lord Pi
has killed another girl.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.912
Why can't you stop him?

14:31.003 --> 14:35.042
I'll kick your teeth in
if I hadn't done it already!

14:35.141 --> 14:37.382
A girl is dead
and you threaten us?

14:37.477 --> 14:39.753
You dare talking
back to me, my monkeys?

14:39.846 --> 14:41.416
Li Guang! Li Guang!

14:41.514 --> 14:45.087
Never, ever
lay hands on me again.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.327
Get back to work.
All of you.

14:56.929 --> 15:00.502
Duyan will resolve
this issue with you later.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.739
You know how.

15:02.835 --> 15:06.180
You all know
the rules and the law.

15:12.879 --> 15:15.189
I hate this hole.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.362
Almost as much as you.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.929
Work!

15:33.566 --> 15:35.876
I don't need
you defending me.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.142
Next time, just mind
your own business.

15:38.237 --> 15:42.242
Li Guang,
you are my younger brother.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.083
But your temper often

15:44.143 --> 15:45.486
gets the best of you.

15:45.878 --> 15:48.916
While you stood there
and did nothing for us!

16:30.923 --> 16:34.097
Master Ho, I need to talk to
you about the murdered girls.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.868
Can you do nothing?

16:39.098 --> 16:43.604
If you have a grievance,
take it up with the mayor.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.650
Master Ho, you must
protect this village!

16:46.706 --> 16:47.980
Kung!

16:54.180 --> 16:55.716
Look who saved your day.

16:56.949 --> 17:00.954
Get this pathetic, ignorant
insect out of my sight.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.983
Come.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.180
We will all come together.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.582
The villagers
want justice.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.159
Not just for
the murdered girls,

17:29.215 --> 17:30.717
but they're killing
miners as well.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.318
Two more yesterday.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.887
I will appeal to Master Ho.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.397
Words are not enough, Mayor.

17:35.488 --> 17:36.899
Yes, I understand.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.825
I'll take care
of it, trust me.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.739
Kung, rumor has it
that your brother

17:45.831 --> 17:47.037
is going to challenge Duyan

17:47.099 --> 17:48.203
at the fight court tonight.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.042
I'm concerned for his safety.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.880
Li Guang can take
care of himself.

17:53.839 --> 17:57.753
Duyan is not a small man.

17:57.843 --> 18:01.120
If he crushes him,
and I suspect he will,

18:01.213 --> 18:03.693
what will be
the miner response?

18:03.749 --> 18:05.888
These are the Honor
Fights, Mayor.

18:05.952 --> 18:09.365
So whatever the outcome,
our people will accept it.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.365
If you get Li Guang
to apologize,

18:12.425 --> 18:13.961
to sacrifice a week's wages...

18:14.060 --> 18:17.473
My brother is a very,
very proud man.

18:17.563 --> 18:19.270
He would never apologize.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.747
So be it.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.312
I understand your fear.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.318
But Mayor Zhang
has promised me

19:03.409 --> 19:05.082
that Master Ho
and his Beetle Clan

19:05.144 --> 19:07.681
is doing everything they
can to find the murderer.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.426
But what if it is
the ghost of Lord Pi?

19:16.622 --> 19:18.363
How will they protect us?

19:18.457 --> 19:19.697
How will you protect us?

19:19.792 --> 19:22.432
Enough with this
superstitious nonsense.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.212
Well, maybe it is Ho himself?
Ever think of that?

19:31.837 --> 19:34.943
We all know of his insatiable
lust for the young flesh.

19:35.541 --> 19:36.884
Innocence.

19:40.479 --> 19:43.688
I will get to the bottom
of this, I promise you.

19:47.887 --> 19:48.888
Right.

19:57.063 --> 19:59.373
Where are you going?

19:59.465 --> 20:01.035
To the tavern.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.010
You're going to the duel.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.878
Everyone is talking about it.

20:05.237 --> 20:08.047
Please don't have him fight.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.177
He has made up
his mind, Ah Ni.

20:10.242 --> 20:12.415
It will kill him
if he doesn't fight.

20:13.479 --> 20:16.358
Well, at least someone in this
family is willing to take a stand.

20:17.483 --> 20:18.655
Innocence!

20:22.388 --> 20:24.095
I will be back
before midnight.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.356
Evil spirits, go away.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.061
<i>My name is Li Guang.</i>

20:53.953 --> 20:56.695
I represent my venerable
home village of Tsai Fu.

20:56.756 --> 21:00.898
Today, one of your guards
displayed unwarranted cruelty

21:00.960 --> 21:02.405
toward my fellow worker

21:03.295 --> 21:05.138
and must be taught humility.

21:12.538 --> 21:13.642
Yes.

21:13.739 --> 21:17.915
But your actions insulted
the entire Beetle Clan!

21:22.081 --> 21:25.790
Therefore, you must face Shou.

22:06.025 --> 22:09.131
Fighters, prepare to battle.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.118
Come on, Li Guang!

22:28.280 --> 22:29.657
Come on, Li Guang!
Get in there!

22:46.565 --> 22:48.545
Come on, now. Come on.

22:48.634 --> 22:49.635
Yeah!

23:01.647 --> 23:02.921
Come on, Li Guang! Come on!

23:04.149 --> 23:05.150
Watch out.

23:16.595 --> 23:17.596
Come on, Li Guang!

24:13.052 --> 24:14.588
That's right! You did it!

24:30.903 --> 24:32.439
Cheers.
Cheers.

24:32.504 --> 24:34.142
Yeah.
Yeah.

24:34.239 --> 24:36.742
It was a thing of beauty.

24:37.576 --> 24:41.183
I can't remember
the last time that a miner

24:41.280 --> 24:42.918
saw such a victory!

24:42.982 --> 24:44.484
It won't be the last!

24:44.583 --> 24:46.324
It's time we stood
up to these bullies!

24:46.418 --> 24:48.364
Stand up! Yes! Yes!

24:48.454 --> 24:49.455
Yeah.

24:49.922 --> 24:50.923
Right, Kung?

24:51.757 --> 24:53.168
You got it, two more.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.671
All right, everyone.
Enough for one night.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.832
Time to go home to your wives.

24:59.932 --> 25:03.311
Kung.
Leave it to you, Li Kung,
to spoil all the fun.

25:03.369 --> 25:04.370
Let's go.

25:04.470 --> 25:06.541
We got work in the morning.

25:08.774 --> 25:10.378
Same old Kung.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.017
That's...

25:13.112 --> 25:14.614
What else could?

25:14.680 --> 25:16.057
Next time.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.621
All right, take a drink.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.360
Let's get out of this place.

25:24.556 --> 25:28.299
Congratulations, brother.
You deserved to win.

25:29.128 --> 25:32.632
But watch your back. They're
gonna be looking for payback.

25:35.467 --> 25:38.311
We can take on these thugs.
You and me.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.474
Li Guang.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.989
You can't forget
your past forever, Kung.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.226
You're drunk.

25:56.321 --> 25:57.322
Go home.

25:58.323 --> 25:59.700
Sleep it off.

26:01.994 --> 26:04.031
Li Guang. Li Guang.

27:05.090 --> 27:06.660
Are you okay?
Hang on, okay?

27:06.758 --> 27:08.760
Wait! Wait!
I'll get someone.

27:08.827 --> 27:10.636
Come help me.
Come on.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.410
Good morning, Bing.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.640
Ah, beetles.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.186
Hey.
My favorite.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.119
Your favorite?

27:26.178 --> 27:28.419
It was my favorite
when I was young, too.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.618
Really?

27:29.681 --> 27:31.627
Yes. Long time ago.

27:33.085 --> 27:38.000
But you must remember
something more important.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.501
What?
Chi.

27:39.591 --> 27:43.596
Chi is an energy
that encompasses us all.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.869
And can I ever see it?

27:45.964 --> 27:47.602
Well, no,

27:47.666 --> 27:52.012
but that's what makes the
power of believing so strong.

28:00.979 --> 28:02.617
What's going on?

28:02.981 --> 28:04.392
What is it?

28:06.685 --> 28:07.857
Come here.

28:09.454 --> 28:11.730
Look what we
found in the river.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.573
<i>No, no, no.</i>

28:17.663 --> 28:19.370
The answer is no.

28:19.464 --> 28:23.139
He could be a criminal,
he could be a killer, or worse.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.306
He has to go.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.077
But, Father,
he's in no condition.

28:27.172 --> 28:29.482
If we move him,
he could die.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.884
Well, you should
have thought about it

28:30.976 --> 28:32.421
before you brought
him into my home.

28:32.978 --> 28:34.423
But, Father, look.

28:36.481 --> 28:37.687
Could it be him?

28:39.585 --> 28:41.087
Maybe.

28:41.186 --> 28:43.928
But with those battle wounds,
he is likely in trouble.

28:44.022 --> 28:46.002
And more trouble,
I don't need.

28:47.826 --> 28:50.864
What, you're taking
her side, too?

28:50.929 --> 28:53.341
I haven't spoken a word.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.344
Well, you don't have to.

28:56.168 --> 28:59.047
Pity the man who lives
in a house full of women.

29:02.674 --> 29:06.520
All right. But first
sign of trouble, he's gone.
You understand?

30:15.747 --> 30:16.851
Come up.

30:19.184 --> 30:22.290
The entire Beetle Clan
was humiliated

30:22.354 --> 30:24.664
by your pathetic
performance last night.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.997
You will need to
learn how to get

30:27.092 --> 30:29.299
these cockroaches
on their knees.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.169
Ah.

30:37.302 --> 30:39.339
Daddy Ho's home.

30:41.606 --> 30:46.783
Come, let me smell your
rosebud and pluck your petal.

30:52.784 --> 30:54.627
Anyone see Li Guang today?

30:55.554 --> 30:58.967
No. But we could sure use
his strong back right now.

31:07.632 --> 31:08.633
Kung!

31:11.636 --> 31:12.910
What is that?

31:13.004 --> 31:14.210
What in hell's name?

31:14.306 --> 31:15.580
Come on. Let me see.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.210
Take a look.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.221
What do you see?

31:22.714 --> 31:24.159
It's a parallel corridor.

31:38.663 --> 31:39.698
Beautiful.

31:59.184 --> 32:00.185
Kung!

32:01.353 --> 32:02.764
This vein is rich in silver!

32:05.690 --> 32:07.033
Look at this!

32:10.695 --> 32:12.655
Then we have to
come back and explore it.

32:12.697 --> 32:16.770
For now, we keep all this
to ourselves, all right?

32:16.868 --> 32:18.028
Let's get back
and plug it up.

32:18.703 --> 32:19.977
Come on.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.383
We're coming back.
Make some room.

32:25.911 --> 32:28.289
This is between
us, got it?

32:28.380 --> 32:29.654
Like a secret!

32:29.748 --> 32:31.728
Okay. Plug it up
before someone sees it.

32:31.817 --> 32:33.160
Yes, boss.

32:38.623 --> 32:39.795
<i>No! No!</i>

32:40.125 --> 32:42.901
<i>There she is.
You can't run from us, girl.</i>

32:44.463 --> 32:47.410
<i>Come out, come out,
wherever you are.</i>

33:05.083 --> 33:06.118
It's all right.

33:07.085 --> 33:08.587
You're safe here.

33:10.355 --> 33:11.459
Here.

33:17.662 --> 33:18.800
Easy.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.109
Where am I?

33:25.270 --> 33:28.615
Jiangxi province.
Outskirts of Tsai Fu.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.512
Near the Wu Chi temple.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.647
Not many know
of this place.

33:34.379 --> 33:36.450
Does anyone else
know that I'm here?

33:36.515 --> 33:39.689
We took great care to
preserve your privacy.

33:41.620 --> 33:42.860
Are you in some
kind of trouble?

33:43.288 --> 33:44.460
Perhaps.

33:46.958 --> 33:48.699
We know who you are.

33:49.394 --> 33:51.305
Your legend
precedes you,
Blacksmith.

33:52.697 --> 33:55.041
They call you the
"Man With the Iron Fists."

33:56.835 --> 33:58.576
Meet my only daughter,
Innocence.

33:59.504 --> 34:01.643
My name is Li Kung.

34:01.706 --> 34:04.152
And that is my wife, Ah Ni.

34:05.911 --> 34:07.322
My name is Thaddeus.

34:08.146 --> 34:10.387
You fight for
the side of good men?

34:10.482 --> 34:11.722
What I did in my past,

34:11.815 --> 34:14.092
and what I do in my future
are two different things.

34:14.985 --> 34:16.829
I no longer have
desire to fight.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.562
I'm on a quest
for inner peace.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.934
Well, you came to
the wrong town for that.

34:22.027 --> 34:23.835
I have to move you
to a safer place.

34:23.995 --> 34:26.703
Master Ho,
the man who owns the mines,

34:26.764 --> 34:28.176
rules this town.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.507
He is a ruthless man.

34:30.201 --> 34:32.078
And if he knows of
your special gift,

34:32.170 --> 34:34.206
he might have
other designs for you.

34:35.106 --> 34:37.552
Innocence is in
charge of your care.

34:37.609 --> 34:40.522
Although she is young,
but she is a gifted healer.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.025
She and her friend
saved you from the river.

34:54.059 --> 34:57.438
I wanna thank you
for saving my life.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.811
I've arranged
for Cha Pow and Bolo

35:10.909 --> 35:13.116
to move Thaddeus
to the old blacksmith shop.

35:13.211 --> 35:14.588
We'll take care
of it, don't worry.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.751
So no one has
seen my brother yet?

35:16.815 --> 35:19.318
Too much celebrating,
I'm sure.

35:20.051 --> 35:21.724
Oh, and be careful.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.766
The walls have eyes
and ears in this town.

35:23.822 --> 35:26.063
In the meantime,
I will look for my brother.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.733
And you be careful.

36:07.432 --> 36:08.638
Who was he?

36:09.534 --> 36:11.138
The last blacksmith.

36:13.271 --> 36:15.444
I guess his
customers wasn't satisfied.

36:19.377 --> 36:20.788
You can rest
here for now.

36:22.614 --> 36:23.957
There's water
and some food.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.698
Also, Li Kung said he'll
stop by to visit you soon.

36:28.787 --> 36:32.132
In the meantime, he wanted
you to take a look at these.

36:54.345 --> 36:55.722
The silver mines.

36:55.814 --> 36:58.192
It seems like everyone in
the whole town works there.

36:58.249 --> 37:00.160
Anyone with an able body.

37:01.019 --> 37:03.090
The old men and the women,

37:03.188 --> 37:06.192
they help run the village,
lake care of the children.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.496
But those that
try to run away,

37:09.561 --> 37:12.508
they end up hanging on the
stakes at the edge of town.

37:14.265 --> 37:17.405
We may be from
different countries,

37:17.502 --> 37:20.381
but we got a lot more in
common than you think, Bolo.

37:20.438 --> 37:22.008
I like to chop the rocks.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.245
I know you do, Cha Pow.

37:23.341 --> 37:24.786
It makes me happy.
Yeah.

37:24.876 --> 37:27.186
But it makes me sad
when the girls die.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.688
What is he
babbling about?

37:31.549 --> 37:34.428
There's been a few
murders recently.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.556
Young women.

37:39.023 --> 37:42.698
Their bodies just shriveled
up like dried fruits.

37:43.128 --> 37:45.074
They say it's evil spirits.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.701
But I know it's
the ghost of Lord Pi.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.940
It's like they're
voided of...

37:51.035 --> 37:52.378
Chi.

38:10.822 --> 38:14.895
Yes. Yes.
Play with each other.
Make each other wet.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.803
Giggle, laugh, enjoy.

38:17.896 --> 38:20.672
I have three rules
I will tell you now.

38:20.765 --> 38:21.903
The first rule,

38:22.801 --> 38:26.010
if you bite me,
I'll rip out your teeth.

38:26.104 --> 38:28.141
If you talk to me,
I'll rip out your tongue.

38:28.239 --> 38:32.449
If you look at another man,
I'll rip out your eyes.

38:33.578 --> 38:34.750
But aside from this,

38:34.813 --> 38:37.316
I'll give you the finest food
and the finest wine,

38:37.415 --> 38:40.259
and we will have a fine time.

38:41.085 --> 38:42.758
Now, play with each other.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.794
Master Ho.

38:47.859 --> 38:48.860
Duyan.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.997
Everything has
been taken care of.

38:51.095 --> 38:53.336
He won't be causing
any more trouble.

39:18.456 --> 39:20.026
This is madness.

39:20.124 --> 39:22.297
No one has ever
been down there before.

39:22.360 --> 39:26.467
Well, Master Ho ordered that we
explore the cave floor below.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.135
He wants to leave
no stone unturned.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.736
Boss, I got a bad
feeling about this.

39:30.835 --> 39:34.339
What if a dragon's clown there?
I don't like dragons.

39:34.405 --> 39:36.316
Then I drown him like a rat.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.581
I don't like rats either.

39:38.676 --> 39:40.383
We're supposed
to keep you safe.

39:41.312 --> 39:42.552
Let me go down instead.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.252
I wouldn't ask my men to do
something I wouldn't do myself.

39:47.151 --> 39:48.596
Let's go.
Let's.

40:50.982 --> 40:52.052
Li Guang.

40:55.653 --> 40:56.893
Li Guang.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.580
I'm sorry, Li Guang.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.628
Hey, you!
Over there! Back to work!

41:32.690 --> 41:34.601
What's the problem, Kung?

41:36.494 --> 41:38.440
Was your brother
not careful?

41:40.365 --> 41:43.278
I made a vow to
always protect my family,

41:44.602 --> 41:45.945
including my brother.

41:46.704 --> 41:48.308
Having failed at this,

41:48.373 --> 41:53.482
I now have no choice
but to honor his legacy
and demand justice.

41:55.780 --> 41:56.986
Cease!

41:58.649 --> 42:00.629
For you, he's family.

42:02.320 --> 42:06.029
For me,
he's another dead miner.

42:06.124 --> 42:09.628
And if any of you other miners
decide to lose your way,

42:10.161 --> 42:11.902
there will be more accidents.

42:12.964 --> 42:14.637
Get used to it.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.739
<i>He was a good man.</i>

42:25.309 --> 42:26.720
A proud man.

42:28.679 --> 42:31.387
He won fair and square.

42:31.482 --> 42:33.393
And now he's dead.

42:34.852 --> 42:36.229
That's not right.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.060
It could have
been an accident.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.571
No sign of foul play.

42:43.661 --> 42:46.835
Your words spill out
like dung from a cow, Zhang.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.377
He was my brother!

42:52.336 --> 42:54.680
You tell your boss
I'm not letting this one go.

42:55.673 --> 42:59.917
You're in no position
to demand anything, Kung.

43:00.011 --> 43:02.082
We must keep
our wits about us.

43:02.914 --> 43:05.451
We don't want to feel the
full force of Ho's wrath...

43:05.550 --> 43:08.963
I have always been
willing to stay in my place

43:09.087 --> 43:12.557
and do Ho's bidding,
as long as it
protected my family,

43:13.191 --> 43:14.192
but now?

43:14.358 --> 43:15.701
I know, I know.

43:17.595 --> 43:18.972
It doesn't seem right.

43:19.363 --> 43:21.400
But I have to warn you,

43:22.433 --> 43:25.141
Ho is not happy you've been
stirring rebellion in the mines.

43:25.736 --> 43:28.717
Watch your back.

43:53.231 --> 43:54.471
<i>So, Mr. Kung, tell me.</i>

43:55.566 --> 43:57.068
<i>These tools?</i>

43:59.670 --> 44:01.149
What's the story?

44:02.273 --> 44:03.980
I hope you didn't
find me presumptuous.

44:04.075 --> 44:07.750
But I wanted to get your
professional opinion on these.

44:08.479 --> 44:11.619
Well, they're made of the
cheapest pig iron I've ever seen.

44:12.750 --> 44:14.354
And if the goal is
to get as much silver

44:14.452 --> 44:16.090
out of the mines as
quickly as possible,

44:16.587 --> 44:17.827
you'll never
reach your quota.

44:18.956 --> 44:20.333
So you understand
my problem.

44:21.759 --> 44:22.760
Can you help us?

44:23.628 --> 44:25.767
I can fill your
pockets with silver.

44:26.964 --> 44:28.102
That won't be necessary.

44:28.299 --> 44:29.471
I'm in your debt.

44:29.534 --> 44:31.605
After all,
you did save my life.

44:32.937 --> 44:34.473
That was my daughter's doing.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.319
Me? I would have
thrown you out.

44:39.677 --> 44:42.556
Well, so much for
southern hospitality.

44:48.619 --> 44:50.496
We are desperate people,
Thaddeus.

44:52.957 --> 44:57.463
I need to liberate us from
the ruthless Beetle Clan.

44:58.362 --> 45:00.308
And when that fight comes,

45:00.364 --> 45:02.044
my people need a way
to protect themselves.

45:02.967 --> 45:05.243
I know you forge
the best weapons.

45:07.138 --> 45:08.674
Will you make them for us?

45:10.541 --> 45:12.543
Mr. Kung,
with all due respect,

45:13.511 --> 45:15.650
I've made many devices
that killed many men.

45:16.314 --> 45:17.987
Even my hands
have become weapons.

45:19.517 --> 45:20.860
I'm on a path to Buddha.

45:21.986 --> 45:23.932
And making weapons
is not on that path.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.835
Doesn't Lord Buddha
protect the weak

45:31.062 --> 45:32.598
and punish evil?

45:37.668 --> 45:40.080
I'll fix your tools for you,
then be on my way.

45:41.172 --> 45:44.016
How you use them
is up to you.

46:43.334 --> 46:44.335
That's very kind of you.

46:44.835 --> 46:45.836
It's nothing.

46:47.838 --> 46:49.010
My bandages,

46:49.640 --> 46:51.278
did you wrap them?

46:51.976 --> 46:53.353
My father did
the dressing.

46:57.315 --> 46:58.794
Your father seems
like a good man.

46:59.083 --> 47:01.654
He's a very gentle
and kind man.

47:03.821 --> 47:05.323
Sometimes I think too kind.

47:09.794 --> 47:12.638
I wish he was more like you.

47:18.369 --> 47:19.370
Brave.

47:19.603 --> 47:20.604
Strong.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.982
You shouldn't take
kindness for a weakness.

47:24.608 --> 47:27.214
Sometimes it takes more courage
not to fight than to fight.

47:28.946 --> 47:30.948
My best friend,
Chow-Li, was murdered,

47:31.816 --> 47:32.817
and then my uncle.

47:35.286 --> 47:36.458
My father did nothing.

47:37.455 --> 47:39.128
I'm sure he has his reasons.

47:40.391 --> 47:42.302
Well, someone
has to do something.

47:42.793 --> 47:45.797
We can't just wait
for Master Ho to act.

48:03.314 --> 48:05.817
We, Beetle Clan,

48:06.484 --> 48:08.930
challenge Li Kung to a duel.

48:18.195 --> 48:19.936
I have no fight
with any of you.

48:25.236 --> 48:28.115
So I humbly decline
your challenge.

48:32.176 --> 48:33.177
Kung.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.185
You cowardly dog.

48:39.183 --> 48:41.060
You vile clown.

48:42.520 --> 48:45.865
Is it that easy for you
to disrespect your village,

48:46.090 --> 48:47.296
your family,

48:48.058 --> 48:50.561
forget about your dead,
rotting brother?

48:54.865 --> 48:57.903
You know, the guards
tell me that your daughter

49:00.905 --> 49:03.112
is quite the budding rose.

49:05.543 --> 49:06.988
I, Li Kung,

49:07.378 --> 49:10.222
of Tsai Fu Village,
accept your challenge...

49:10.448 --> 49:12.223
Yes! Yes!

49:13.150 --> 49:15.892
...in honor of
my brother, Li Guang.

49:18.823 --> 49:22.828
And don't ever, ever
mention my daughter again.

50:03.300 --> 50:04.301
Kung! Be careful!

50:21.285 --> 50:24.129
<i>We can take on
these thugs. You and me.</i>

50:26.991 --> 50:28.629
<i>You can't forget
your past forever, Kung.</i>

51:05.229 --> 51:06.264
Yeah!

51:06.564 --> 51:08.942
He did it! We won! Yeah!

51:13.003 --> 51:14.505
Yeah!

51:27.217 --> 51:28.218
Cha Pow!

51:29.086 --> 51:31.692
Cha Pow, I need
your muscles inside.

51:32.056 --> 51:33.763
Uh, I think I'm supposed
to watch the door.

51:37.061 --> 51:38.369
Let him guard the door.

51:45.235 --> 51:48.239
The beauty of iron lies
in its ability to adapt.

51:48.739 --> 51:53.449
It offers quick results
and fast change.

51:59.583 --> 52:01.062
You've got a knack
for this, Cha Pow.

52:01.885 --> 52:03.990
Metal is strong, like me.

52:17.301 --> 52:20.510
You are no ordinary miner.

52:22.239 --> 52:23.843
You are much
more than that.

52:26.243 --> 52:28.746
Your abilities in the ring
gave you away last night.

52:29.913 --> 52:32.587
You belong to the
Praying Mantis Clan,
don't you?

52:33.951 --> 52:35.123
Look, Kung,

52:35.352 --> 52:37.263
I don't like Ho
any more than you do,

52:37.588 --> 52:39.590
but I answer to
that monster directly.

52:39.657 --> 52:42.433
And you have
a target on your back.

52:43.961 --> 52:44.962
Anything else?

52:50.501 --> 52:53.277
Go back to
representing the miners.

52:53.437 --> 52:54.939
And let me work on
Ho for concessions.

52:55.139 --> 52:56.777
But be forewarned,

52:57.441 --> 52:59.512
don't push Ho.

53:00.344 --> 53:03.188
Ho can make things
difficult for you and me.

53:03.781 --> 53:05.192
And your family.

53:08.452 --> 53:10.989
You may answer to Ho,
but I don't.

53:12.122 --> 53:13.624
Not to you,
not to anyone.

53:14.792 --> 53:15.793
Not any longer.

53:18.362 --> 53:20.638
Kung.

53:21.298 --> 53:22.800
I am not the enemy, Kung.

53:23.701 --> 53:24.702
Kung!

55:08.672 --> 55:10.242
Boss.

55:10.307 --> 55:13.083
Boss. You must come
to the duel tonight.

55:13.177 --> 55:14.747
Too much work to be
done here, Cha Pow.

55:17.314 --> 55:19.089
What's so special
about tonight anyway?

55:19.283 --> 55:21.593
Li Kung is going to
challenge Master Ho.

55:22.753 --> 55:23.754
Foolish.

55:29.426 --> 55:30.427
Cha Pow.

55:31.161 --> 55:32.162
Yes, boss?

55:35.499 --> 55:36.500
A gift. For you.

55:38.535 --> 55:39.536
For all your hard work.

55:50.314 --> 55:51.315
Cha Pow!

55:51.782 --> 55:52.783
Cha Pow, Let's go!

55:53.150 --> 55:54.493
Li Kung is waiting.

55:54.551 --> 55:55.552
Come on.

55:55.853 --> 55:56.957
Thank you.

56:04.995 --> 56:06.133
What's this? Come here...

56:07.297 --> 56:08.298
Boss!

56:11.468 --> 56:12.469
You're bleeding!

56:15.339 --> 56:16.899
Let's try to bandage
this up, when we...

56:17.174 --> 56:18.244
When we get there.

57:02.185 --> 57:03.960
You all know me as Li Kung.

57:04.888 --> 57:06.367
Master Ho,

57:06.690 --> 57:09.432
you have committed crimes
against the people

57:09.526 --> 57:10.869
of Tsai Fu Village.

57:13.263 --> 57:15.265
You have overseen corruption.

57:15.532 --> 57:18.536
You have condoned
abuse and murder.

57:19.603 --> 57:24.484
And tonight, your
reign of terror will end.

57:30.881 --> 57:32.258
Come on!

57:32.316 --> 57:33.488
Take him down!

57:33.583 --> 57:34.755
We won't take anymore!

57:35.285 --> 57:36.286
I,

57:37.454 --> 57:39.559
Li Kung, of Tsai Fu Village,

57:39.723 --> 57:41.100
challenge you to a duel.

58:09.653 --> 58:12.930
I accept Kung's
pathetic challenge.

58:16.259 --> 58:17.260
We fight.

58:25.969 --> 58:27.778
Come on,
Li Kung! Yeah!

58:36.446 --> 58:37.618
Let the fight begin!

58:39.950 --> 58:40.951
Come on!

59:23.160 --> 59:24.161
Come on!

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:24.233
Come on!
Come on! Yeah!

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:38.268
Come on!

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:41.271
Yeah!

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:02.496
You don't bring a knife

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.761
to a sword fight.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:07.805
One of your guards stabbed Li
Kung on the way to the arena!

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:09.099
You betrayed us again!

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.002
You got something
to say, Bolo?

01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:15.612
You step forward and take
this lowly maggot’s place.

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:17.345
And you, old man!

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.942
You still got
some fight in you?

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:20.977
I got this.

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:41.032
What else you got?

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:42.532
I got him.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:46.673
Arrest these traitors.

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:48.678
Hang them in the morning

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:51.878
so the whole village
can witness their execution.

01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:54.649
Anyone else want
to join them?

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:59.684
You get to hang with
a mine dog, blackie.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.022
I'm here like
a frog on a string.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:08.833
Worthless.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:12.434
Never thought I'd miss
all-American stock and chains.

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:16.734
It's hard for me to accept
that your arrival here

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:18.608
is a mere coincidence,
Thaddeus.

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:22.744
I simply was trying
to make it to the Wu Chi
temple to redeem myself.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:26.680
They say at the temple,
there's a spring,

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:28.784
a well of some sort,

01:02:29.379 --> 01:02:31.086
with a concentrated
level of chi.

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:33.248
They call it
the Golden Nectar.

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:37.263
They say with this chi,
a man can reach immortality.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:39.859
Me?

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.395
I'm just trying to
replenish my soul.

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:45.238
Well, in the mines,

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:48.039
<i>they found a water source.</i>

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:50.734
<i>Must be below the temple.</i>

01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:56.912
Ho never wanted the silver.

01:02:57.874 --> 01:02:58.875
He wants the water!

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:27.604
Mayor Zhang!

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:30.912
Guess my arms still work.

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.489
Zhang, you saved our lives.

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:42.761
Up till now,
you and I have been partners
in the business of this town.

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:46.029
But tonight,
you became my friend.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:50.798
If only I could show an ounce
of your bravery, Kung.

01:03:52.462 --> 01:03:55.636
But it's hard to be great
man like you, with no legs.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.336
If only I could
join your fight.

01:03:59.803 --> 01:04:02.647
- Brother Kung's right.
- You saved our lives.

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:06.874
And to liberate this town,
it's gonna take all
the help we can get.

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:09.979
I can make you legs, Mayor.

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:11.717
And you can join the fight.

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:14.390
I am grateful for
the sentiment, but...

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:16.219
But how?

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:19.159
I could forge you legs.
The way I forged these arms.

01:04:21.658 --> 01:04:24.901
I never have dreamed
of such a thing.

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:29.308
With legs,
I can stand with you all

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:32.135
and rid this town
of the Beetle Clan,

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:33.879
once and for all.

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:36.312
That's only half
of our problem.

01:04:37.507 --> 01:04:38.986
That water
source in the mines.

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:44.017
We gotta get moving before
they find out we escaped.

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:47.488
Bolo, you get the miners ready
for battle by the break of dawn.

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:50.557
Cha Pow, you get
whatever Thaddeus needs.
Okay.

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.655
I'll meet everyone back
in front of the mines.

01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:55.158
Thaddeus.

01:04:55.859 --> 01:04:56.997
Brother Kung.

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:21.360
This is not for the
faint at heart.

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:22.756
You will be in pain.

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:24.691
I mean, a lot of pain.

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:28.392
When I lost my legs,
I lost everything,

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:33.032
even my chance
to have a family.

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:35.772
Well, I promise you
I'll help you walk again.

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:38.110
I'm not
touching anything else.

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:42.114
Cha Pow, increase the fire.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:44.274
Legs.

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:00.062
Thought I'd lost you.

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:01.157
Father.

01:06:02.926 --> 01:06:04.428
You can't get rid
of me that easy.

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:10.407
It's time we stand up
and take back our lives.

01:06:30.854 --> 01:06:31.855
Are you ready?

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:36.701
I've been dreaming for
this moment way too long.

01:06:37.861 --> 01:06:40.137
<i>Chi is a universal life force,</i>

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:41.770
<i>flowing through all matter,</i>

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:43.634
<i>organic and inorganic,</i>

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.204
but when one is able
to control this chi,

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:49.111
he can use it to
activate inanimate objects.

01:06:58.781 --> 01:06:59.782
Are you ready?

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:01.317
Gag him.

01:07:21.004 --> 01:07:22.044
Okay, come on.

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:52.543
You have my eternal
gratitude, Blacksmith.

01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:54.704
Let's get you walking.

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:03.379
You're standing!

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:08.293
Easy. Easy, my friend.

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:11.865
The journey of a thousand miles
starts with a single step.

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:49.828
What is your purpose here?

01:08:50.827 --> 01:08:52.067
I am Li Kung,

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:55.408
a simple worker
from Yin Silver Mine,
near Tsai Fu Village.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.671
What business have you here?

01:08:58.001 --> 01:09:00.572
I believe your sacred water
source is in danger, Abbott.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.617
It's the mine.

01:09:17.754 --> 01:09:20.200
<i>What we thought was
a mining operation for silver</i>

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:23.267
<i>turned out to be a mining
operation for your sacred wafer.</i>

01:09:26.194 --> 01:09:27.537
<i>Master Ho is an evil man,</i>

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:29.709
<i>an indiscriminate killer.</i>

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:32.469
<i>He's trying to steal the Golden
Nectar our from under you.</i>

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:34.441
Who is he

01:09:35.438 --> 01:09:39.283
to walk along a path where even
the mightiest have failed?

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:43.380
<i>Once, a truly powerful warrior</i>

01:09:44.212 --> 01:09:47.386
<i>tried to steal the Golden
Nectar for his evil purposes.</i>

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.564
<i>But he was defeated.</i>

01:09:54.157 --> 01:09:57.331
<i>Being of royal blood,
we could not kill him.</i>

01:09:58.161 --> 01:10:01.404
<i>But we made sure
he was never a threat again.</i>

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:07.905
So now we must join forces
to protect the Golden Nectar.

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:12.678
Leave me alone!

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:16.979
Good.

01:10:28.658 --> 01:10:30.035
My chi isn't enough.

01:10:31.027 --> 01:10:32.227
You must have patience, Mayor.

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:34.330
These things take time.

01:10:36.165 --> 01:10:39.078
We don't have time.

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.111
Let him go.

01:10:49.612 --> 01:10:51.956
He's right.
We don't have time.

01:11:10.967 --> 01:11:12.071
Stop! Look at that!

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:13.942
Look. Do you see that?

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.579
What's that light?

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:22.723
The Golden Nectar
has reached the mountain!

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.480
One hundred men,
to the village.

01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:30.831
The rest of you,
follow me to the falls.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.565
Ah! Here you are.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:42.674
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:44.433
And this

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:47.305
should look familiar
to you, slave boy.

01:11:48.171 --> 01:11:50.051
You worthless Beetles
are about to get squashed.

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:51.340
Take him!

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:06.162
Kung!

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.100
Mayor!

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:13.511
What are you doing?

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:15.580
That is not your mayor!

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:17.440
That is Lord Pi.

01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:23.278
You traitor!

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:25.848
Lord Pi!
I spared your life,

01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:29.693
but I made sure you will
never walk or fight again.

01:16:31.387 --> 01:16:33.389
My legs have returned.

01:16:33.556 --> 01:16:37.766
And I will conquer these
lands once and for all.

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:40.238
You have followed
a misguided path, Pi.

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:42.306
Because of
your black friend

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:44.377
and the Golden Nectar,

01:16:44.867 --> 01:16:49.373
the power of chi has fortified the
way of the Scorpion within me.

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:51.550
Not if I stop you first.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:54.610
Bring the girl!

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:56.712
Father!

01:16:57.546 --> 01:16:58.547
Innocence!

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:02.058
You touch her, I'll kill you!

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.392
Not if I kill you first.

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:05.087
You coward!

01:17:06.055 --> 01:17:07.056
Pi!

01:17:07.423 --> 01:17:10.097
I gave you the Golden Nectar
and I gave you the girls.

01:17:11.427 --> 01:17:12.667
I'll take Kung.

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.138
He's all yours!

01:17:21.237 --> 01:17:24.343
And you are mine.

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:10.886
Innocence!

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:30.539
Innocence.

01:18:31.307 --> 01:18:34.311
No!

01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:48.201
Thaddeus! Help!

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:14.918
No!

01:22:58.073 --> 01:23:00.644
I'm here. It's all right.
It's all right.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.681
Innocence!

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:07.185
She's alive!

01:24:00.802 --> 01:24:04.841
Well, brother Kung,
the winds of change
are upon you now.

01:24:05.807 --> 01:24:06.979
Brother Thaddeus,

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:09.819
if fate indeed is
the master planner,

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:12.988
then may it smile
upon your journey.

01:24:13.849 --> 01:24:16.022
And may fate cause
our path to cross again,

01:24:17.853 --> 01:24:18.854
brother Kung.

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:04.471
<i>So Cha Pow, he got a new job</i>

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:07.046
<i>and a new set of teeth.</i>

01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:10.445
<i>The Abbott and the monks,</i>

01:25:10.806 --> 01:25:13.286
<i>they continue to protect
the source of Golden Nectar</i>

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:16.556
<i>with the help of the miners.</i>

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.986
<i>Brother Kung,
he became mayor
of the village.</i>

01:25:23.585 --> 01:25:26.725
<i>He took control of the mining
operations which brought great wealth</i>

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:29.268
<i>and happiness to the
long-suffering people of Tsai Fu.</i>

01:25:30.559 --> 01:25:33.233
<i>And me,
my journey begins again.</i>

01:25:33.762 --> 01:25:37.141
<i>You know, the Chinese say,
"Where there's iron,
there's rust. "</i>

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:41.311
<i>Yet rust only arrives
when the iron is not in use.</i>

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:46.185
<i>I may not find peace
in this strange land,
but I will find usefulness.</i>

01:25:53.849 --> 01:25:57.092
<i>You know,
it's funny how a man can be
a deposed wretch in one land</i>

01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:58.821
<i>and a hero in another.</i>

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:01.499
<i>I guess that's just
the way of the Tao.</i>

01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:02.591
So be it.
