WEBVTT

00:06.839 --> 00:11.579
"And on that tragic day, an era
came to its inevitable end."

00:11.612 --> 00:13.814
That's all there is.
Are you ready?

00:13.846 --> 00:15.215
Hit me.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.484
Which of the following

00:16.516 --> 00:18.518
best expresses the theme
of the passage?

00:18.551 --> 00:19.986
A: Violence breeds violence,

00:20.019 --> 00:22.256
B: All things must end,

00:22.289 --> 00:23.190
C...

00:23.224 --> 00:25.326
B. I'm going with B.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.827
We haven't had a B in
forever.

00:26.859 --> 00:29.062
This is the SATs, Buffy,
not connect-the-dots.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.998
Please pay attention.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.432
A low score could seriously harm

00:32.466 --> 00:34.268
your chances
of getting into college.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.337
Gee, thanks. That takes
the pressure right off.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.737
This isn't meant
to be easy, you know.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.006
It's a rite of passage.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.607
Well, is it too late
to join a tribe

00:40.640 --> 00:42.676
where they just pierce something
or cut something off?

00:42.710 --> 00:44.645
Buffy, please concentrate.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.680
Roll!

00:47.715 --> 00:49.817
(growling)
What?

00:51.085 --> 00:53.320
(grunting)

01:06.667 --> 01:08.635
Hmm. I broke
my number two pencil.

01:08.668 --> 01:10.271
We'll have to do this
again sometime.

01:10.304 --> 01:13.706
C: All systems tend
towards chaos.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.144
I just know that us
and the undead

01:16.176 --> 01:18.611
are the only people
in Sunnydale working this late.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.049
MAYOR:
 I appreciate you coming.

01:23.082 --> 01:26.254
I realize it is early...

01:26.287 --> 01:27.721
for you...

01:27.754 --> 01:29.323
but I think you'll agree

01:29.356 --> 01:33.060
that this matter is
urgent,
also... delicate.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.962
I'm a very delicate person.

01:34.995 --> 01:36.963
So you feel
you can handle
this?

01:36.996 --> 01:38.932
It's a little
out of my element,

01:38.966 --> 01:40.634
but I can get you
what you need.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.802
I know a beast
who knows a guy.

01:42.835 --> 01:45.739
Are you sure that subcontracting
is the way to go here?

01:45.772 --> 01:48.075
Well, this guy's worked
your town before,

01:48.108 --> 01:49.909
and if he lives
up
to his rep,

01:49.942 --> 01:52.780
this place will be in flames.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.248
I've made certain deals
to get where I am today.

01:55.283 --> 01:58.319
This demon requires
his tribute.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.087
You see,
that's what separates me

02:00.120 --> 02:02.790
from other politicians,
Mr. Trick.

02:08.627 --> 02:11.799
I keep my campaign promises.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.469
(sniffs)

02:17.538 --> 02:20.039
Where'd I put that Scotch?

02:22.141 --> 02:25.212
(wolf howling)

02:25.246 --> 02:27.480
*

03:20.600 --> 03:22.836
And then I was being chased
by an improperly filled-in

03:22.870 --> 03:25.038
answer bubble screaming,
"None of the above!"

03:25.072 --> 03:28.341
Wow. I hope that wasn't
one of your prophecy dreams.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.176
Probably not.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.844
Hey you know,
I took it last year.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.713
I could help you get
ready.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.848
There's this whole trick
to antonyms,
but...

03:35.883 --> 03:37.784
uh, well, this isn't the
place.

03:37.817 --> 03:39.586
Oz is the
highest-scoring person

03:39.620 --> 03:40.721
ever to fail to graduate.

03:40.753 --> 03:42.555
Isn't she cute
when she's proud?

03:42.590 --> 03:43.956
She's always cute.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.192
We could work on it tonight.

03:45.224 --> 03:46.593
Work on what tonight?

03:46.627 --> 03:48.461
Oh, God. Are we killing
something again?

03:48.496 --> 03:49.896
Only my
carefree spirit.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.230
Buffy SAT
Prep.

03:51.264 --> 03:53.700
Oz is helping.
He's the highest-scoring--

03:53.734 --> 03:55.902
We know. We did
the impressed thing already.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.638
I hate they make
us
take that thing.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.872
It's totally fascist,
and
personally,

03:59.906 --> 04:01.974
I think it discriminates
against the
uninformed.

04:02.008 --> 04:03.811
Actually, I'm
looking forward to it.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.145
I do well
on standardized tests.

04:05.177 --> 04:09.081
What? I can't have layers?

04:09.115 --> 04:10.751
So, Buff, study tonight?

04:10.783 --> 04:12.586
Uh, yes on the studying,
no on tonight.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.121
I'm putting in Mom time.

04:14.153 --> 04:15.955
She's been drastic
ever since I got back,

04:15.989 --> 04:17.156
and Giles is even worse.

04:17.189 --> 04:18.925
I'm supervised
24-7.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.663
It's like being in
the Real Wor house, only real.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.230
Hmm. Ooh, candy bars!

04:24.264 --> 04:26.500
Lots of 'em!

04:26.533 --> 04:27.567
Principal Snyder, thank you!

04:27.600 --> 04:30.002
You weren't
visited

04:30.036 --> 04:32.473
by the Ghost of Christmas
Past,
by any chance?

04:32.505 --> 04:34.173
It's band candy.

04:34.206 --> 04:37.345
Let's hear it for
the band, huh? Very generous.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.947
You will sell it to raise money
for the marching band.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.415
They need new uniforms.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.250
Yeah. Those tall,
fuzzy hats ain't cheap, huh?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.485
But they go
with everything.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.153
BUFFY:
I'm sure we love the idea

04:46.185 --> 04:49.622
of going all Willy Loman,
but we're not in the band.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.091
And if I'd handed you
a trombone,

04:51.124 --> 04:53.259
that would've
been
a problem, Summers.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.995
It's candy.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.963
Sell it.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.367
But you're not in the band.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.201
And yet.

05:01.233 --> 05:04.004
Buffy, what would I do
with 40 chocolate bars?

05:04.036 --> 05:06.273
You could hand them out
at the gallery.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.975
"Buy something pre-Columbian,
get a free cavity."

05:10.310 --> 05:11.644
20.

05:11.678 --> 05:12.646
You're a good mom.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.848
I'm the best.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.449
No, I'm pretty sure
the best moms

05:16.483 --> 05:18.117
let their daughters drive.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.952
And yet.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.555
Oh, come on!

05:21.588 --> 05:24.223
Look, let's not have
this conversation.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.694
But I took the class.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.495
I watched the filmstrips
with the blood

05:28.528 --> 05:30.398
and the death and the
corpses.
I'm prepped.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.231
Honey, you failed
the written test.

05:32.264 --> 05:35.334
They wouldn't even let you
take the road test.

05:35.369 --> 05:38.038
That was a year ago,
and I don't test well...

05:38.071 --> 05:41.007
she said,
two days before the SATs.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.175
I spend enough time
not knowing where you are.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.579
I don't want to add to that
the possibility

05:45.612 --> 05:47.079
that you're on
the highway to Chicago.

05:47.113 --> 05:49.182
I can't believe you.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.218
I'm not taking off again.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.920
Besides, if I wanted to,

05:53.954 --> 05:55.322
I could just get on a bus.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.257
Stop. Don't.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.161
I just don't
want you driving, okay?

06:01.194 --> 06:02.896
I want you here.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.665
I'm here. Hmm?
See me here.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.535
Mm-hmm

06:07.567 --> 06:09.502
Mmm... I got to go.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.838
What, you're going out?

06:10.870 --> 06:12.906
Giles.
Slay-study double feature.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.341
Could be late.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.709
Again? Honey,
don't you think Mr. Giles

06:16.744 --> 06:18.612
is monopolizing
an awful lot of your time?

06:18.646 --> 06:21.180
And does he ever say
he's sorry?

06:21.213 --> 06:22.249
Ow!

06:22.281 --> 06:23.850
Sorry.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.019
Why do I put up
with this?

06:27.053 --> 06:29.221
Because it is
your
destiny...

06:29.255 --> 06:31.824
and because I just bought
20 "Cocorific" candy bars.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.529
Okay, you're just doing this
to take funny pictures of me.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.365
I'm doing it to test
your awareness

06:38.398 --> 06:40.468
of an opponent's location

06:40.500 --> 06:42.603
during a fight
in total darkness.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.137
Now, wait five
seconds,

06:44.170 --> 06:46.473
and then throw
the ball at me.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.242
You ran out of new training
ideas about a week ago, huh?

06:49.276 --> 06:50.409
Okay.

06:50.444 --> 06:54.346
Five, four, three,
two, one.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.721
It's not that simple,
is it?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.088
Ow. (clears throat)

07:02.122 --> 07:04.091
Yes, well, very good.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.125
Thanks.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.396
W-Where are you going?
We have to
patrol.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.398
I can't.
Mom's in hyperdrive.

07:11.430 --> 07:12.766
She wants me home tonight.
I told you.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.502
But I...

07:14.535 --> 07:15.802
I know, I know.
She's out of control.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.471
Enjoy the candy.

07:43.062 --> 07:45.465
*

08:20.399 --> 08:22.935
Buffy.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.375
I didn't know
you could do that.

08:30.276 --> 08:33.480
I-I'm feeling better.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.414
Angel

08:40.553 --> 08:42.722
Let's get you inside.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.530
It's late.

08:51.565 --> 08:52.865
How'd you get away?

08:52.899 --> 08:54.433
Oh, it was easy.

08:54.466 --> 08:56.403
Started a fire
in the prison laundry
room.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.038
Rode out
in
the garbage truck.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.673
Oh.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.710
I'm
joking.

09:02.743 --> 09:03.876
No
garbage.

09:03.910 --> 09:05.144
Smell me.

09:20.559 --> 09:23.897
How is uh... Scott?

09:23.931 --> 09:25.865
Scott?

09:25.899 --> 09:28.802
Oh, um... boyfriend Scott.

09:28.836 --> 09:32.239
Uh... actually, he's not...

09:33.405 --> 09:35.609
He's fine.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.477
Uh, that's for
you.

09:38.510 --> 09:41.447
Uh... it's fresh
from the butcher.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.283
Thanks.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.652
(clears throat)

09:52.024 --> 09:54.662
You're being careful, right?

09:54.695 --> 09:56.562
With Scott?

09:56.596 --> 09:57.831
The slaying.

09:57.865 --> 10:01.100
Oh. Uh, yeah. Of course.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.403
Full of carefulness.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.206
I worry about
you.

10:08.140 --> 10:10.043
I worry about
you.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.179
I'm getting stronger.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.948
Yeah, pretty soon
you won't even need me.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.850
That'll be
better.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.724
Yeah.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.171
Hey. Uh,

10:38.205 --> 10:39.706
sorry I'm late.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.408
You know Giles--
all slay, all the time.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.879
Hello, Buffy.

10:47.346 --> 10:49.448
Do you guys want
to watch some television?

10:49.481 --> 10:51.719
I hear there's
a very insightful Nightline on.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.821
JOYCE: Buffy,
you lied to us,

10:53.854 --> 10:55.956
and you made us
into your alibis.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.725
That's playing us
against each other,

10:57.758 --> 10:59.625
and that's not fair.
I called Willow.

10:59.658 --> 11:02.195
You also lied to her
about your whereabouts.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.429
We were all concerned.

11:05.097 --> 11:07.234
Oh, thank you.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.970
Look, I'm sorry, but I had to...

11:10.003 --> 11:11.571
Were you at The Bronze?

11:11.604 --> 11:13.639
What was happening there
that was so important?

11:13.673 --> 11:15.542
Bronze things.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.845
Things of bronze.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.047
You're acting
really immature, Buffy.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.048
I know I'm not your parent,
but I am responsible for you.

11:22.081 --> 11:23.316
I think your mum's right.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.484
Okay, fine. I'm acting like a
child.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.586
Maybe that's because

11:26.619 --> 11:27.653
you're both treating
me like a child.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.654
Buffy

11:28.687 --> 11:29.655
You're both scheduling me

11:29.688 --> 11:30.857
24 hours a day.

11:30.890 --> 11:31.859
Between the two of you,

11:31.892 --> 11:33.525
that's 48 hours.

11:33.559 --> 11:34.995
I just
want
to be able to make

11:35.028 --> 11:36.764
a few decisions on my own.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.498
The last time you made a
decision on your own, you split.

11:38.530 --> 11:39.899
Yeah, and I took
care of
myself.

11:39.932 --> 11:42.769
I don't need this much
active parenting.

11:42.802 --> 11:45.272
You can't really be trying
to use this
summer

11:45.304 --> 11:47.340
as a reason
you should be trusted.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.109
You can't babysit me
all the time.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.677
I need you
to back off a little.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.846
All right, come-come on.
Let's not, uh, freak out.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.282
"Freak out"?

11:55.315 --> 11:57.951
Hmm? Uh, I think
you should go to bed.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.719
Um, we're all tired.

12:08.761 --> 12:11.097
Oh, she just
drives me crazy.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.067
(sighs)

12:15.101 --> 12:17.604
I just want
to protect her.

12:17.636 --> 12:19.438
Don't all parents
want that?

12:19.471 --> 12:23.043
Yeah, but at least
most parents have some idea

12:23.076 --> 12:24.977
what to protect
their children from.

12:25.011 --> 12:28.816
Yeah. And I think we
should
both be especially
careful.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.450
Mmm.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.923
(mechanical whirring)

12:39.125 --> 12:40.460
Trust me.

12:43.495 --> 12:45.865
You don't want
to eat that.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.812
Dude, think fast.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.649
(sighs)

13:03.682 --> 13:05.784
I heard that there was
a secret rule

13:05.818 --> 13:08.154
that if a teacher is more
than 10 minutes late,

13:08.187 --> 13:09.456
we can all leave.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.291
It's Giles' turn
to watch study hall.

13:11.323 --> 13:12.458
He'll be here.

13:12.491 --> 13:13.592
He's allergic to late.

13:13.625 --> 13:15.695
He i wound
a little tight.

13:15.727 --> 13:17.297
I had this philosophy book

13:17.330 --> 13:19.099
checked out from the library
for, like, a
year,

13:19.131 --> 13:21.268
and he made me pay the fine,
even though it was huge.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.437
I was sad to return it.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.606
It was perfect for starting
conversations with college boys.

13:27.639 --> 13:29.176
Of course, that was B.X.

13:29.208 --> 13:30.509
B.X.?

13:31.744 --> 13:33.947
Before Xander. Clever.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.347
XANDER
I like chocolate.

13:35.381 --> 13:37.517
There is no bad here.

13:37.549 --> 13:39.119
You still have some left?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.520
I went to, like, 4 houses,
and they were gone.

13:41.553 --> 13:43.623
It's like trick-or-treating
in reverse.

13:43.655 --> 13:45.792
I know. These things are
selling like hot
cakes,

13:45.825 --> 13:48.427
which is ironic, 'cause
the
hot cakes really aren't
moving.

13:52.764 --> 13:55.402
And it's uh, (clears throat)
fun to sell chocolate.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.875
And we're raising
a lot of money for the band.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.014
The band.
Yeah.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.081
They're great.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.317
They
march.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.085
Like an army.

14:15.455 --> 14:19.558
E-Except with music
instead of bullets,

14:19.591 --> 14:22.695
and... usually no one dies.

14:26.865 --> 14:28.268
I can't believe this.

14:28.301 --> 14:31.203
(thumps loudly)
Where is Giles already?

14:31.238 --> 14:33.873
I'm bored, and he's not here
to give me credit for it.

14:36.308 --> 14:37.876
The big pinhead librarian
didn't show up,

14:37.911 --> 14:39.778
and I don't want to do it.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.413
You do it.

14:41.447 --> 14:44.084
All right, fine.
I'll do
it.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.421
Everybody expects me
to do everything around
here

14:48.455 --> 14:50.923
because I'm the principal.

14:50.957 --> 14:54.394
It's not fair.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.129
Hey!

14:56.163 --> 14:59.599
We're all stuck here, okay?

14:59.631 --> 15:02.269
So now let's
just sit quietly and...

15:02.302 --> 15:04.636
and pretend
we're reading something

15:04.671 --> 15:07.874
until we're really sure that
old Commandant Snyder's gone.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.476
Then we're all out of here.

15:10.509 --> 15:12.078
Does anyone else want
to marry Ms. Barton?

15:12.111 --> 15:13.913
Get in line.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.416
I guess Giles isn't coming.

15:16.448 --> 15:18.018
I guess not.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.437
Buffy.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.904
Uh... sorry.

15:38.937 --> 15:41.274
I-I was just worried.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.509
You were a big not-there
in study hall,

15:43.543 --> 15:45.511
and after your lecture
to me on not ducking out--

15:45.544 --> 15:47.080
and what is my mother
doing here?

15:47.114 --> 15:48.947
We had an opportunity
for
a--

15:48.981 --> 15:50.582
you might
say--
a summit meeting.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.851
It took priority
over study hall.

15:52.884 --> 15:54.921
I called in.

15:54.953 --> 15:56.355
Oh.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.590
We decided
that

15:57.624 --> 15:58.957
you made
a good point earlier, honey.

15:58.991 --> 16:00.092
I did.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.995
Yeah.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.629
Which was...?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.164
About us
over scheduling you.

16:05.197 --> 16:07.167
Pulling
you
in two
directions--

16:07.200 --> 16:11.638
your home life
and your duties as a slayer.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.173
Oh. That was a good point.

16:14.206 --> 16:17.043
We're working out
a coordinated schedule for you.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.145
It'll be tight,
but we think we can fit in

16:19.178 --> 16:20.312
all your responsibilities.

16:20.346 --> 16:24.216
Sounds nice and structured.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.153
We've got more work
to do here, honey.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.821
Why don't you give us
a little more time?

16:28.855 --> 16:30.356
Um...

16:30.389 --> 16:34.693
take the car, and, um,
Mr. Giles can drive me home.

16:34.726 --> 16:36.395
What?

16:36.428 --> 16:38.998
(chuckles)
Excuse me, I meant what?!

16:39.032 --> 16:40.799
Keys. Take them.

16:40.832 --> 16:43.403
You don't have to
tell me twice.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.172
Actually, you
did,

16:45.205 --> 16:46.505
but... bye!

16:46.538 --> 16:47.974
Bye, honey.
Drive careful.

16:48.006 --> 16:49.176
Uh-huh!

16:52.445 --> 16:54.581
Do you think
she noticed anything?

16:54.614 --> 16:57.783
No way.

17:07.059 --> 17:09.028
WILLOW: Tell me again
 how it happened.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.597
Told my mom I wanted to be
treated more like a grown-up,

17:11.631 --> 17:13.833
and voila-- driviness.

17:13.865 --> 17:16.135
(tires
screeching)

17:20.271 --> 17:22.540
Also, I think
she wanted me otherwhere.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.544
Considering my mom and Giles
are planning my
future,

17:24.576 --> 17:26.546
I think it's easier
for them to live my
life

17:26.578 --> 17:28.248
if I'm not actually there.

17:28.280 --> 17:32.184
Do you know that you have
the parking brake on?

17:32.219 --> 17:33.519
Uh-huh

17:33.552 --> 17:34.787
(releases parking brake)

17:36.489 --> 17:37.957
Are-are you sure
about The Bronze?

17:37.990 --> 17:41.059
I mean, the SATs are
tomorrow.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.628
I can
study
at The Bronze.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.731
A little dancing,
a little cross-multiplying.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.201
You know what we need?

17:48.234 --> 17:49.469
(switching radio channels)

17:49.501 --> 17:51.238
Eyes on the road!
Eyes on the road!

17:53.940 --> 17:55.107
(music playing)

17:58.310 --> 18:00.547
You got good albums.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.449
Yeah, they're okay.

18:02.481 --> 18:04.317
* And the colors
of the sea *

18:04.351 --> 18:05.984
Do you like Seals and Croft?

18:06.018 --> 18:09.288
* And you touch
the distant beaches *

18:09.321 --> 18:11.824
Yeah. Me, neither.

18:13.292 --> 18:16.296
Thanks.

18:16.328 --> 18:19.298
So how come they
call you Ripper?

18:19.332 --> 18:21.433
Wouldn't you like
to know.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.636
Hmm, wait a minute.
Listen to this bit.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.640
(guitar solo playing)

18:27.673 --> 18:29.308
It rocks.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.676
It's good.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.846
Man, I got to get
a band together.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.150
Hey, Ripper,
you want to watch TV?

18:37.183 --> 18:39.486
I know how to order
pay-per-view.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.453
No, let's go out
and have some fun...

18:41.488 --> 18:43.155
tear things up a bit.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.325
Okay. We could go
to The Bronze.

18:45.357 --> 18:48.528
Not bloody likely.
That place is dead.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.630
(rock music playing)

18:50.663 --> 18:51.830
(shouting)

19:09.249 --> 19:12.219
MAN: You guys rock!

19:12.251 --> 19:13.986
Hey, they're digging us, man.

19:15.521 --> 19:19.625
* The strangest things
always know *

19:19.659 --> 19:25.030
* Saves me every time

19:28.401 --> 19:30.303
* Darkened things

19:30.336 --> 19:32.904
* Have overgrown...

19:32.939 --> 19:35.741
Let's do
the Time Warp again.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.345
Maybe there's
a reunion in town

19:38.377 --> 19:41.381
or a Billy Joel tour
or something.

19:41.413 --> 19:43.316
Ms. Barton?

19:43.349 --> 19:45.317
Buffy?
Whoa!

19:45.352 --> 19:47.220
Are you okay, Ms. Barton?

19:47.253 --> 19:49.154
Oh, I'm cool, Willow.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.258
Willow-- that's a tree.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.592
(laughs)
You're a tree.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.059
Yeah, uh...

19:54.093 --> 19:57.596
Are there any nachos
in here, little tree?

19:57.630 --> 20:00.333
Are you sure you don't
need
some fresh air, Ms.
Barton?

20:00.366 --> 20:02.568
(laughing hysterically)
Okay.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.570
Okay, this is not normal.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.605
But maybe that goes
without saying.

20:06.638 --> 20:08.941
Hey,
gang!

20:08.974 --> 20:11.176
This place is
fun city, huh? (laughs)

20:11.210 --> 20:13.179
Principal Snyder?

20:13.211 --> 20:14.580
Call me Snyder.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.516
Just a last name,
like Barbarino.

20:16.548 --> 20:20.185
Ooh! I am so stoked!

20:20.219 --> 20:22.255
(sighs

20:22.288 --> 20:23.455
Hey, did you see Ms. Barton?

20:23.490 --> 20:25.223
I think she's wasted.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.426
I'm gonna have to put that
in her next performance
review

20:27.460 --> 20:31.230
'cause... 'cause
I'm the
principal!

20:31.263 --> 20:34.032
I don't like this.
They could have heart attacks.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.903
Well, maybe
there's
a doctor here.

20:36.935 --> 20:39.572
(whooping) Yeah!

20:39.605 --> 20:41.473
I think that is my doctor.

20:43.241 --> 20:45.744
He-he's usually
less topless.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.480
I got a commendation
for being principal...

20:48.515 --> 20:49.781
from the mayor.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.317
Shook my hand twice.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.451
That's nice.

20:52.484 --> 20:55.387
(inhales deeply)

20:55.422 --> 20:59.291
Whoa! There are
some foxy ladies here
tonight!

21:00.792 --> 21:01.928
What's happening?

21:01.961 --> 21:03.462
I don't know,

21:03.496 --> 21:05.632
but it's happening
to a whole lot of grown-ups.

21:05.664 --> 21:07.400
They're acting
like a bunch...

21:07.433 --> 21:09.769
They're acting
like
a bunch of us.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.637
I don't act like this.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.240
MR. TRICK:
Demand's high.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.776
I thought it might
be.

21:16.808 --> 21:18.009
That's the reason
I love this
country.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.445
You make a good product,

21:19.479 --> 21:21.513
and the people
will come to you.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.583
Of course, a lot of them
are gonna die,

21:23.615 --> 21:25.617
but that's the other
reason
I love this country.

21:25.652 --> 21:26.853
Hey!

21:26.885 --> 21:28.654
Don't sample the product.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.189
But I didn't.

21:30.221 --> 21:31.958
(groans)

21:34.527 --> 21:38.431
Okay. Uh, how did
you know he was...

21:38.464 --> 21:41.000
I don't. But now I know
no one else will.

21:41.032 --> 21:42.969
We're getting close.

21:43.001 --> 21:44.269
Keep it flowing.

21:44.302 --> 21:46.305
It's almost feeding time.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.614
Something's definitely
changing them.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.147
A spell?

21:56.182 --> 21:57.517
They're
teenagers.

21:57.549 --> 22:00.553
It's a sobering mirror
to look into, huh?

22:02.721 --> 22:05.357
You've got great hair.

22:07.226 --> 22:09.596
(group of men singing
"Louie Louie")

22:11.931 --> 22:13.532
* Louie louie

22:13.566 --> 22:15.535
* Oh, baby

22:15.567 --> 22:17.503
* We gotta go

22:17.537 --> 22:19.337
* Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah
*

22:19.372 --> 22:21.140
* Louie louie

22:21.173 --> 22:23.342
* Oh, baby

22:23.375 --> 22:25.644
* We gotta go

22:25.678 --> 22:27.046
It just gets
more upsetting.

22:27.078 --> 22:28.247
* Louie louie

22:28.279 --> 22:30.717
* Oh, baby

22:30.750 --> 22:32.151
* We gotta go

22:32.183 --> 22:34.921
No vampire has ever
been that scary.

22:34.953 --> 22:36.154
* Louie louie

22:36.188 --> 22:37.723
* Oh, baby...

22:37.757 --> 22:39.991
Fight!

22:40.026 --> 22:41.594
Fight!

22:41.627 --> 22:43.028
* Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah
*

22:43.061 --> 22:44.931
We've got to figure out
what's going on.

22:44.963 --> 22:46.566
This has Hellmouth
fingerprints all over it.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.537
Hey, where are we going?

22:51.703 --> 22:54.574
Wait up, you
guys!

22:54.606 --> 22:57.743
Hey! You guys aren't trying
to ditch me, are you?

22:57.777 --> 23:00.179
OZ: We should find Giles.

23:00.211 --> 23:01.748
He'll know
what's going on, right?

23:01.780 --> 23:03.915
Sure. Except for all we know,
he's sweet 16 again.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.586
He's with your mom
at his place.

23:06.618 --> 23:08.954
I said wait up!

23:08.988 --> 23:10.189
OZ: Uh, Snyder...

23:10.221 --> 23:11.390
No time.
He's coming with us.

23:11.423 --> 23:13.759
(tires squealing)

23:13.792 --> 23:16.295
SNYDER: Whoa, Summers!

23:16.327 --> 23:18.464
You drive like a spaz.

23:18.498 --> 23:19.731
(engines revving)

23:35.781 --> 23:37.849
(tires squealing)

23:42.755 --> 23:45.491
(laughs)

23:54.933 --> 23:56.969
It'll be okay
when we get to Giles'.

23:57.002 --> 23:58.505
Of course. I mean,
even if he's 16,

23:58.538 --> 23:59.905
he's still Giles, right?

23:59.939 --> 24:01.473
He's probably
a pretty together guy.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.776
Yeah. W-Well...

24:03.809 --> 24:05.511
What?

24:05.545 --> 24:07.413
Giles at 16?

24:07.445 --> 24:09.315
Less "together guy,"

24:09.347 --> 24:11.116
more "bad magic,
hates the world,

24:11.150 --> 24:12.618
ticking time bomb
guy."

24:12.652 --> 24:15.320
Well, then I guess your mom's
in a lot of trouble.

24:17.388 --> 24:19.991
Must be exciting
being from
England.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.961
Not particularly.

24:21.993 --> 24:23.328
You cold?

24:23.362 --> 24:26.265
Nah-uh. I feel
special,

24:26.298 --> 24:28.099
like I'm just
waking up, kinda.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.501
Oh, yeah?

24:29.536 --> 24:31.303
Yeah, like getting married

24:31.336 --> 24:33.338
and having a kid
and everything was just a dream,

24:33.372 --> 24:35.508
and now things are back
like they're supposed to be.

24:35.541 --> 24:36.709
Yeah?

24:36.742 --> 24:38.644
That's cool!

24:38.677 --> 24:40.680
Very Juice Newton.

24:40.712 --> 24:42.181
You fancy it?

24:42.213 --> 24:44.383
Yeah, but
the store's
closed.

24:50.489 --> 24:51.691
(alarm blaring)

24:51.723 --> 24:53.692
(giggling)

24:58.497 --> 24:59.531
(whooping)

24:59.566 --> 25:00.732
Oh,
Ripper!

25:00.767 --> 25:02.101
Wow! That was so brave!

25:04.604 --> 25:05.837
Hold it!

25:08.840 --> 25:10.542
This is great!

25:10.576 --> 25:13.078
Let's do doughnuts
in the football field,
huh?

25:17.616 --> 25:18.750
Oh, my God, look out!

25:25.592 --> 25:27.192
Ooh.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.996
Copper's got a gun.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.230
You'll never use it,
though, man.

25:32.263 --> 25:33.633
Will so.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.536
Ripper, be
careful.

25:37.569 --> 25:39.038
(grunting)

25:46.578 --> 25:48.314
Told him he'd never use it.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.651
You are so cool.

25:53.586 --> 25:55.121
(laughs)

25:55.153 --> 25:56.756
You're
like
Burt Reynolds.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.392
(gasps

26:16.307 --> 26:19.945
Sorry. Gotta
go.
(laughing)

26:19.979 --> 26:21.780
Oh, God.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.415
Are you guys okay?

26:24.450 --> 26:26.317
Is anybody else
all creeped out and trembly?

26:26.352 --> 26:30.288
(indistinct conversation)

26:30.321 --> 26:33.092
Oh, Buffy, your mom's
gonna kill
you.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.261
Something's weird.

26:36.295 --> 26:37.896
Something's not?

26:37.930 --> 26:39.665
No grown-ups.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.300
Hey,
baby!

26:42.334 --> 26:43.635
No one's protecting
their houses.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.604
Everyone's just wandering.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.273
Hey!

26:49.340 --> 26:50.777
Hey, give it!

26:50.809 --> 26:52.478
Defenseless.

26:52.510 --> 26:54.079
Come on!
That's mine!

26:54.113 --> 26:55.914
So where are all the
vampires?

26:55.948 --> 26:57.950
SNYDER: Hey!
He stole my candy!

26:57.983 --> 27:00.152
Soup's on, but no one's
grabbing a spoon.

27:00.185 --> 27:02.520
Something's happening
someplace that's else.

27:02.554 --> 27:05.290
I'm gonna say something big.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.992
That guy took my candy!

27:08.694 --> 27:11.196
The candy.
It's got to be the candy!

27:11.230 --> 27:12.699
It's cursed.
A curse?!

27:12.731 --> 27:15.201
I've got a curse.

27:15.233 --> 27:16.702
Oh, my God...
using candy for evil.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.938
My parents ate a ton.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.138
Who's behind it?

27:20.172 --> 27:21.440
I don't know.

27:21.472 --> 27:23.342
It came through
the school board.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.476
If you knew that crowd...

27:24.509 --> 27:25.644
Where did it come from?

27:25.678 --> 27:27.779
Do you know
where to get it?

27:27.814 --> 27:29.715
Yeah.
You guys get
Xander and Cordelia.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.017
Go to the library
and look it up.

27:31.049 --> 27:32.684
Candy curses?

27:32.719 --> 27:33.853
Disturbing second childhood.

27:33.885 --> 27:35.320
Got it.

27:35.354 --> 27:38.356
Ratboy and I are going
to the source.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.826
(shouting)

27:58.944 --> 28:00.378
Mom?

28:00.412 --> 28:01.480
Giles?!

28:01.512 --> 28:03.182
Go away.
We're busy.

28:03.214 --> 28:05.416
Mom!
Hey!

28:05.451 --> 28:08.186
Where did you get that coat?
Never mind. Listen...

28:08.220 --> 28:09.855
Back off.

28:09.888 --> 28:11.390
Giles, think about this.
You want to fight me,

28:11.423 --> 28:13.058
or you want to let me
talk to my mother?

28:18.064 --> 28:19.865
Mom, look at me.

28:19.898 --> 28:21.067
Do you know who I am?

28:21.099 --> 28:22.401
Of course. You're Buffy.

28:22.433 --> 28:24.103
Hey, look.

28:24.135 --> 28:25.703
They're giving away candy.
You want some candy?

28:25.738 --> 28:28.740
No, I don't, and you don't need
any more, either.

28:28.775 --> 28:31.877
I'm fine.
I can have more if I want.

28:31.911 --> 28:34.445
You are not fine.
You need to go home.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.214
(sighs) Screw
you.

28:37.415 --> 28:38.717
I want candy.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.086
Mom!

28:40.118 --> 28:41.519
You want to slay stuff,

28:41.552 --> 28:43.221
and I'm not allowed
to do anything about it.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.391
Well, this is what I want
to do, so get off my back.

28:45.423 --> 28:47.859
Mom, please.
Oh, for God's sake.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.728
Just let your mum have the
soddin' candy. Come on, Joyce.

28:49.761 --> 28:51.063
Mom, look at your
car.

28:51.096 --> 28:52.198
Look at that dent
the size of New Brunswick.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.298
I did that.

28:53.332 --> 28:55.101
Oh, my
God.

28:55.134 --> 28:58.604
What was I
thinking
when I bought the geek
machine?

28:58.636 --> 29:00.205
(laughing)

29:00.239 --> 29:01.707
Listen to me.
You need...

29:01.740 --> 29:03.209
No, you listen to me.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.243
I'm your watcher,
so you do what I tell you.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.577
Now, sod off!

29:09.015 --> 29:11.616
Take her home.

29:11.650 --> 29:13.618
Joyce.

29:15.954 --> 29:17.623
(grunting)

29:27.432 --> 29:28.767
Mom!

29:28.800 --> 29:29.935
Hey!

29:29.969 --> 29:32.137
Hey! You leave her alone!

29:34.772 --> 29:36.843
Hey, Brit-face! Wait up!

29:39.010 --> 29:40.346
Stay.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.460
It smells so chocolatey.

29:54.492 --> 29:56.127
This is far out.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.197
Yeah, I been out there.
Town's wide open.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.365
You guys can go anytime.

30:00.398 --> 30:01.968
Ethan Rayne.

30:10.175 --> 30:12.678
Might want to hurry.

30:12.711 --> 30:14.813
Ethan.

30:15.981 --> 30:18.150
Ripper.

30:24.522 --> 30:26.025
CORDELIA: At first
it was fun, you know?

30:26.057 --> 30:28.359
They seemed like they were
in this really good mood--

30:28.394 --> 30:30.628
not like parents--
and then...

30:30.662 --> 30:32.498
Badness?

30:32.530 --> 30:34.165
Mom started
borrowing my clothes.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.567
There should be an age limit
on lycra pants.

30:36.602 --> 30:39.238
And Dad, he just locked
himself in the bathroom

30:39.270 --> 30:40.705
with old copies of Esquire.

30:40.739 --> 30:42.141
XANDER
I don't get this.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.143
The candy's supposed
to make you feel

30:44.175 --> 30:45.912
all immature and
stuff,
but I've had a
ton,

30:45.944 --> 30:47.546
and I don't feel
any dif...

30:47.578 --> 30:48.881
Never
mind.

30:48.914 --> 30:51.017
I'll take that one.

31:03.194 --> 31:04.730
CORDELIA:
You want to swap?

31:04.762 --> 31:06.365
What? Swap?

31:06.397 --> 31:08.366
You want to swap?
This book is really thick,

31:08.400 --> 31:10.736
and I'm not sure
it's in English.

31:17.776 --> 31:20.378
*

31:40.766 --> 31:43.634
(panting) Where...
Bloody Hell!

31:43.669 --> 31:45.570
That's what
smoking
will do to
you.

31:45.604 --> 31:46.872
Now be quiet.

31:46.904 --> 31:49.075
Well, where'd
the bastard go?

31:49.107 --> 31:50.442
Shh!

31:56.281 --> 31:57.749
What?

32:06.357 --> 32:09.127
Look, a box full
of farm-fresh chicken.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.566
Do you suppose
they're okay?

32:14.599 --> 32:16.201
Mm-hmm.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.771
So...

32:20.806 --> 32:23.275
are you two kinda...

32:23.308 --> 32:26.278
like, um...

32:26.311 --> 32:27.945
going steady?

32:29.681 --> 32:31.182
(sighs)

32:35.320 --> 32:38.624
(sighs)

32:38.656 --> 32:40.625
So, Ethan,
what are we playing?

32:40.659 --> 32:42.127
We're pretty much
in a talk-or-bleed situation.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.328
Your call.

32:43.362 --> 32:44.829
Hit him.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.332
I-I'd just like to point out

32:46.365 --> 32:48.166
that this wasn't my idea.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.601
Meaning...?

32:49.634 --> 32:52.804
I'm subcontracting.
It's Trick you want.

32:52.837 --> 32:55.173
I'm just helping him
collect a tribute...

32:55.207 --> 32:56.474
for a
demon.

32:56.508 --> 32:57.709
He's
lying.
Hit him!

32:57.742 --> 32:59.845
I don't think he is,
and shut up.

32:59.877 --> 33:01.880
You're my slayer.
Go knock his teeth down his...

33:01.913 --> 33:03.182
Giles!

33:04.750 --> 33:07.185
What demon?

33:07.219 --> 33:09.121
I don't remember.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.321
(grunts)

33:10.355 --> 33:12.391
Yes!

33:12.423 --> 33:16.028
Lurconis.
Demon named Lurconis.

33:16.061 --> 33:19.830
They wanted a way to get
the tribute away from people.

33:19.865 --> 33:21.333
So you're just
diversion guy?

33:21.366 --> 33:22.867
More than a diversion.

33:22.901 --> 33:25.070
They said
the tribute was big,

33:25.104 --> 33:27.338
so big that
people
would never let them take it.

33:27.373 --> 33:30.008
People...
had to be out of it.

33:30.041 --> 33:32.844
And later on,
when the candy wore off,

33:32.877 --> 33:34.079
they'd blame themselves.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.814
Hence, land of
the
irresponsible.

33:35.846 --> 33:37.316
So, where's Trick?

33:37.348 --> 33:39.684
I don't know exactly.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.153
Go on. Hit him again.

33:41.186 --> 33:42.488
No! I-I-I really don't know.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.522
Delivering the tribute.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.825
Which brings us
to
the bonus question,

33:46.857 --> 33:48.359
and believe me when I say

33:48.394 --> 33:50.061
a wrong answer
will cost you all your
points.

33:52.397 --> 33:54.700
What's the tribute?

33:54.732 --> 33:56.602
(television playing,
phones ringing)

33:56.634 --> 33:58.069
(buzzer beeping)

34:14.219 --> 34:16.621
(babies crying)

34:40.311 --> 34:43.547
Right. Ow. Lurconis.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.251
Lurconis, a demon.
What's his deal?

34:46.284 --> 34:48.387
See if it says anything
about a tribute.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.556
A tribute? Like what?

34:50.588 --> 34:51.623
I don't know.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.791
My source

34:53.824 --> 34:55.059
is all tapped
out.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.094
She whooped you good, huh?

34:57.128 --> 34:58.664
Pow! Pow!

34:59.364 --> 35:01.400
I can do that.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.802
I took tae kwon do
at the Y.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.204
(grunting)

35:11.108 --> 35:13.010
No, no.
It's definitely a demon.

35:13.043 --> 35:14.213
A big one.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.521
(gun clicks)
I
wouldn't.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.492
Giles, give me the gun.

35:27.525 --> 35:29.494
Giles..

35:29.527 --> 35:31.128
now.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.434
Uh, it's um, it's Willow.
She wants you real bad.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.637
Uh-huh?

35:38.670 --> 35:40.371
Okay, Oz just found
it.

35:40.405 --> 35:43.309
The tribute to
Lurconis
is made every 30
years.

35:43.342 --> 35:45.710
It's a ritual feeding.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.313
And this one's late,

35:47.346 --> 35:50.282
so it's probably,
you know, a big meal.

35:50.315 --> 35:53.952
Oh, and... Oh.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.387
Lurconis eats babies.

35:58.356 --> 36:00.057
Come
on.

36:00.090 --> 36:01.827
What about that man?

36:01.860 --> 36:04.396
Uh, see if you guys can find
something to tie him up with.

36:04.429 --> 36:05.896
Um--

36:10.735 --> 36:12.737
Never tell
me.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.344
WOMAN: I didn't see anything.

36:18.376 --> 36:20.211
I don't know where they are.

36:20.246 --> 36:23.681
Something's gonna
eat those babies?

36:25.217 --> 36:28.085
I think that is so wrong.

36:28.119 --> 36:30.322
She says she never
saw who took them.

36:30.356 --> 36:32.257
Dowsey
cow.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.592
I know who took them.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.193
Well, then let's
do something.

36:35.226 --> 36:38.496
Let's find the demon
and kick the crap out of it.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.431
Is that what
happens now?

36:40.465 --> 36:42.400
Yeah, if we knew
where they were.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.168
"Lurconis dwells
beneath the city,

36:44.202 --> 36:45.836
filth to filth."

36:45.871 --> 36:47.539
What?

36:47.572 --> 36:49.740
Ooh, I know this.

36:49.775 --> 36:52.543
Uh, I knew this.

36:52.577 --> 36:56.514
"Lurconis" means...

36:56.547 --> 36:57.916
"Glutton."

36:57.949 --> 37:00.918
And we'll find it, um...

37:00.952 --> 37:03.188
in the sewers.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.255
The sewers?

37:04.289 --> 37:05.523
Uh, good.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.726
You go do that thing
with the demon,

37:07.759 --> 37:10.094
and I'll stay here in case
the babies, you know, uh...

37:10.128 --> 37:11.697
find their way back.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.900
The babies must be
so scared.

37:14.932 --> 37:16.134
You filthy little ponce.

37:16.166 --> 37:17.702
Are you afraid
of a little
demon?

37:17.735 --> 37:19.204
If you want to splash
around in the
poo,

37:19.237 --> 37:20.371
you're the filthy one!

37:20.405 --> 37:22.139
Okay, you know what?
Everybody just stop it.

37:22.172 --> 37:24.742
Okay, listen to me.

37:24.775 --> 37:26.644
I need help,
okay?

37:26.677 --> 37:28.313
Giles, I need grown-ups.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.748
These children
are gonna die

37:30.782 --> 37:33.318
if we don't act now,
okay, and think clearly.

37:33.351 --> 37:35.721
There is no room for
mistakes.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.989
Besides which,

37:38.023 --> 37:40.759
you guys are just
wigging me out.

37:40.791 --> 37:43.394
GILES: Sorry.

37:43.429 --> 37:44.596
We'll behave.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.597
BUFFY: Good.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.666
Snyder, go home.

37:48.699 --> 37:51.469
I can do
that.

37:51.503 --> 37:53.438
Giles, we're
going
to the sewers.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.275
And don't do that!

38:01.612 --> 38:03.981
(chanting in Latin)

38:04.014 --> 38:06.385
(babies crying)

38:24.869 --> 38:26.605
Come on, big guy.

38:26.637 --> 38:29.641
They're not getting
any fresher.

38:29.675 --> 38:31.476
(crying
continues)

38:38.650 --> 38:40.284
Carol. Hi.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.688
Yeah, call Dave on the
public works committee tomorrow

38:43.722 --> 38:45.724
about sewer maintenance
and repair.

38:45.757 --> 38:48.527
I have some concerns
regarding exposed gas
pipes,

38:48.559 --> 38:50.528
infrastructure, ventilation.

38:50.561 --> 38:54.199
And, uh, cancel my 3:00.

39:02.239 --> 39:03.409
Hi.

39:05.210 --> 39:06.677
(snarling)

39:08.045 --> 39:10.014
(grunting)

39:26.364 --> 39:29.134
(crying
continues)

39:40.878 --> 39:42.246
(rumbling)

39:52.557 --> 39:54.492
What the hell's that?

39:57.628 --> 39:59.831
(hissing)

40:01.298 --> 40:03.068
Lurconis, I'm thinking.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.369
TRICK: Ordinarily,
I like other people

40:04.402 --> 40:06.237
to do my fighting for me,

40:06.271 --> 40:08.373
but I just gotta
see what you got.

40:08.405 --> 40:10.876
Just tell me when it hurts.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.342
Come on, baby.

40:13.177 --> 40:14.244
Giles, no!

40:21.418 --> 40:24.255
(rumbling)

40:27.458 --> 40:28.793
(gas hissing)

40:31.429 --> 40:32.597
(screeching)

40:42.873 --> 40:44.442
TRICK:
You and me,
girl...

40:44.476 --> 40:47.112
There's hard times ahead.

40:47.144 --> 40:50.148
(sighs)
They never just leave.

40:50.181 --> 40:52.117
Always got to say something.

40:52.150 --> 40:55.586
(babies crying)

40:55.621 --> 40:58.255
Can we go home
now?

40:58.289 --> 40:59.791
(sighs) Yeah, we can go home.

40:59.824 --> 41:02.092
I've got the SATs tomorrow.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.663
Oh, blow them off.
I'll write you a note.

41:07.364 --> 41:09.501
No, it's okay.

41:09.534 --> 41:12.237
JOYCE:
Poor babies. Come
here.

41:14.539 --> 41:15.840
And your
friend?

41:15.873 --> 41:17.708
Paid him.

41:17.742 --> 41:19.510
The man did his job.

41:19.545 --> 41:21.880
No reason to burn that
bridge.

41:21.913 --> 41:24.215
This didn't turn out
the way I had planned.

41:24.248 --> 41:26.317
Where's the downside?

41:26.351 --> 41:28.186
You just got yourself
one less demon

41:28.219 --> 41:29.655
you have to pay tribute to.

41:29.688 --> 41:32.690
The way I see it,
I did you a favor.

41:32.724 --> 41:34.358
I guess you
did.

41:36.094 --> 41:38.329
In the
future...

41:38.362 --> 41:40.465
I'd be very careful

41:40.498 --> 41:42.500
how many favors you do for me.

41:48.907 --> 41:51.309
(indistinct chatter)

41:51.342 --> 41:52.577
(school bell ringing)

41:54.746 --> 41:57.583
Hey, Snyder. Heard you had
some fun Friday night.

41:57.615 --> 41:59.349
Have you come down yet?

41:59.384 --> 42:00.818
That's Principal Snyder.

42:00.851 --> 42:02.688
And that's a big "yep."

42:02.721 --> 42:04.188
You look like
four young people

42:04.222 --> 42:05.590
with too much
time
on your hands.

42:05.623 --> 42:07.025
Not
really.

42:07.057 --> 42:09.094
Busy like a bee, actually.

42:09.126 --> 42:10.829
Bee-like.

42:10.862 --> 42:14.666
Good. It seems we had
some vandalism Friday

42:14.699 --> 42:17.702
on school property,
and I was just looking

42:17.735 --> 42:20.237
for some... volunteers

42:20.271 --> 42:22.807
to help clean it up.

42:25.710 --> 42:28.378
"Kiss rocks"? Why would
anyone want to kiss...

42:28.413 --> 42:31.516
Oh, wait. I get it.

42:31.548 --> 42:32.951
Let's get you
some paint remover.

42:36.286 --> 42:38.923
It was
just
too much to deal with.

42:38.956 --> 42:41.726
It was like
nothing
made sense
anymore.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.929
The things that I thought
I understood were
gone.

42:44.963 --> 42:48.532
I just felt... so alone.

42:48.565 --> 42:50.902
Was that the math
or the verbal?

42:50.936 --> 42:52.269
Mostly the math.

42:52.302 --> 42:55.106
Well, if you scored low,

42:55.139 --> 42:56.907
then you can always
take them again.

42:56.942 --> 42:58.876
More SATs?

42:58.909 --> 43:00.811
Ugh. Was there
really a
point?

43:00.846 --> 43:02.981
I could die before
I even apply to college.

43:03.014 --> 43:06.150
Then it very possibly
might not.

43:06.184 --> 43:08.920
Well, let's just
keep hope alive.

43:08.954 --> 43:10.722
Hello.

43:10.755 --> 43:11.657
Hi.

43:11.690 --> 43:15.159
I say, your car seems

43:15.193 --> 43:16.393
to have had an adventure,
doesn't
it?

43:16.427 --> 43:17.829
Uh, Buffy assures me

43:17.862 --> 43:19.831
that it happened
battling evil,

43:19.864 --> 43:23.300
so I'm letting her pay for it
on the installment plan.

43:23.333 --> 43:24.469
BUFFY:
Uh, hey...

43:24.501 --> 43:25.771
the way things
were
going,

43:25.804 --> 43:27.605
be glad that's
the worst that happened.

43:27.639 --> 43:29.139
At least I got
to the two of you

43:29.173 --> 43:31.876
before you
actually
did something.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.916
Right.
Indeed.

43:37.949 --> 43:40.050
Yes.

44:16.755 --> 44:19.224
Grr. Argh.
