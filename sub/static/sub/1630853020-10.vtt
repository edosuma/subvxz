00:13.840 --> 00:16.680
<i>King Edward is close</i>
<i>to finally realizing</i>

00:16.760 --> 00:21.160
<i>his father’s ambition to create</i>
<i>a single kingdom… England.</i>

00:21.239 --> 00:26.920
You are as good and true
and faithful a man as your father.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.480
This is your destiny.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.400
To Bebbanburg then, Lord Uhtred?

00:31.480 --> 00:34.600
We retain Northumbria
for the Saxon people!

00:35.680 --> 00:38.840
<i>But the enemy has made</i>
<i>his own preparations for battle.</i>

00:38.920 --> 00:43.960
When King Constantin's army appears
on the horizon, set fire to that church.

00:44.560 --> 00:49.360
Our plan to ambush is mistimed.
Constantin is already within the fortress.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.720
<i>Edward was anxious</i>
<i>to commence the attack…</i>

00:51.800 --> 00:54.120
Our targets are all in one place.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.480
Storm the fortress now
and we trap Aethelhelm and Constantin.

00:57.560 --> 01:00.040
<i>…but reluctantly agreed to hold back</i>

01:00.760 --> 01:03.360
<i>and allow me to attempt a rescue.</i>

01:03.440 --> 01:06.440
He draws the guards down to the beaches
before the tide turns,

01:06.520 --> 01:09.000
giving you a very small
and reckless opportunity to get in

01:09.080 --> 01:10.880
by the guard's room before they return.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.320
<i>Whilst Aelswith</i>
<i>sought assistance from elsewhere.</i>

01:15.400 --> 01:17.360
It is very foolish of you to come here.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.480
I’m no friend to Christians.

01:19.560 --> 01:22.960
<i>Edward’s impatience</i>
<i>led him to renege on the plan</i>

01:23.040 --> 01:25.640
<i>and mount a rash assault</i>
<i>on the fortress.</i>

01:25.720 --> 01:27.480
We have waited and heard nothing.

01:27.560 --> 01:29.800
The time offered to prevail
is slipping away.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.080
This is madness.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.960
Give us Lord Aethelhelm
and Lady Aelfwynn

01:34.040 --> 01:35.200
and we will not attack.

01:35.280 --> 01:39.600
Refuse and we will besiege
and kill you all!

01:39.680 --> 01:41.320
None will survive!

01:41.960 --> 01:43.880
<i>Destiny is all!</i>

02:42.960 --> 02:44.520
I will assume that was a warning!

03:01.560 --> 03:02.920
They do not wish to comply.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.800
Did you see my father?

03:19.680 --> 03:22.040
I will get the girl,
parade her from the ramparts.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.680
Will King Constantin agree to that?

03:23.760 --> 03:25.880
If we do not ask, he cannot refuse.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.880
Come on! Move! Move!

03:56.920 --> 04:00.040
Ignore all demands, play for time.

04:00.120 --> 04:03.040
Ignore a challenge, one king to another?

04:03.120 --> 04:04.040
It’s dishonorable.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.920
Wait for your armies.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.400
Get the marriage bond sealed.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.720
I could, of course, simply hand you over.

04:10.800 --> 04:14.600
We are so close to getting what we want.

04:14.680 --> 04:18.080
You have confessed them.
Get to the sacrament.

04:19.080 --> 04:20.440
Are you ready?

04:21.399 --> 04:25.880
The gate guard can rebuff any assault,
but as a precaution,

04:25.959 --> 04:29.000
I would place
the Lady Aelfwynn somewhere safe.

04:29.080 --> 04:31.000
A higher room is fortified.

04:31.840 --> 04:34.920
Yes, wise. Aelfwynn, go with Lord Wihtgar.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.600
You see,

04:40.440 --> 04:42.840
we can withstand a siege.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.280
Just let Edward attack!

04:47.040 --> 04:48.640
To sit and wait,

04:48.720 --> 04:49.960
it’s not in my blood.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.600
If he comes to the gate,

04:54.680 --> 04:56.160
I will speak to him.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.760
Why are we on the ramparts?

05:04.840 --> 05:06.600
To show Edward you are still alive.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.280
That is not what was discussed.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.760
Show her to the Saxons.

05:26.440 --> 05:27.920
Put a knife to her throat.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.840
- Go! Offer a negotiation!
- No!

05:40.000 --> 05:41.040
Say nothing.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.160
Truly King Edward does not come for me.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.120
I’m just caught in this.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.520
Then throw her over.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.360
Show them we are ruthless.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.200
Release her and I will not kill him.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.640
Uhtred.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.840
Do you want to see him die?

06:15.240 --> 06:16.840
Let her go.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.440
Run.

06:22.960 --> 06:23.960
Run!

06:34.600 --> 06:36.880
Follow him!

06:39.200 --> 06:40.400
Guards, seize him!

06:40.480 --> 06:42.920
Quick! Move yourselves!

06:43.600 --> 06:45.480
Lord, here.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.880
- You escaped?
- Of course we did.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.240
And we found…

06:55.200 --> 06:56.320
Why did you come?

06:56.400 --> 06:58.400
I feared Haesten would betray your plan.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.520
He did not.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.400
He was put to the sword concealing it.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.520
Then his death finally brings him honor
and he will be welcomed to Valhalla.

07:11.520 --> 07:12.880
Did you find Aelfwynn?

07:12.960 --> 07:15.200
I had her within my grasp but no longer.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.320
And Edward has attacked, so time is short.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.120
Well, we still have the advantage.

07:20.200 --> 07:24.320
- They do not know you are here.
- Uhtred! Uhtred!

07:24.400 --> 07:26.400
Is that you or some other Uhtred?

07:27.560 --> 07:28.800
Uhtred!

07:28.880 --> 07:30.480
Where is he?

07:30.560 --> 07:33.400
- Who?
- Edward's man is within! Uhtred!

07:33.480 --> 07:37.000
- Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
- Uhtred, the Imposter! Yes!

07:37.840 --> 07:39.960
This alliance has brought me nothing!

07:40.040 --> 07:42.160
Now he hunts me in my own fortress!

07:42.240 --> 07:44.240
If he hunts you, I suggest you find him.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.240
Send all armed guards to the gate!

07:48.560 --> 07:51.720
Bring my grandson Aelfweard to me.
I want the atheling by my side.

09:07.400 --> 09:10.240
Quickly! Quickly, go to your positions!

09:10.920 --> 09:13.680
As fast as you can. We can hold them off.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.040
They are dogs. We are men!

09:21.160 --> 09:22.320
Quickly, carry on!

09:22.400 --> 09:23.240
Carry on!

09:26.560 --> 09:27.640
Go!

10:02.680 --> 10:04.200
We’re saved!

10:24.040 --> 10:25.640
Stand here with me.

10:25.720 --> 10:29.040
We have lost this fight.
Throw yourself at my father's mercy.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.080
I’ll plead for you.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.880
You lost any influence with him
when you joined with me.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.360
We will hold our nerve and make you king.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.080
Your grandfather promises a great deal.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.520
Some more advice.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.840
When events change, plans should change.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.080
Drink this.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.560
It’ll calm your nerves.

10:58.280 --> 11:01.000
My father made me swear
I would not drink.

11:01.520 --> 11:06.760
Well, your father has
not shown himself to be wise in judgement.

11:08.320 --> 11:13.080
- We seem to be the ones…
- Hild, if we distract the remaining guard,

11:13.160 --> 11:16.960
can you get her to the sea gate
and to safety with Father Pyrlig?

11:19.520 --> 11:23.200
Yes, I will need a torch to signal to him.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.120
You will need a weapon.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.680
I had hoped never to hold
such a thing again.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.840
It breaks my heart
to drag you to this fight.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.160
Nothing dragged me but my own will.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.000
Protect her as you have protected others.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.600
I will.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.640
Fight on for Bebbanburg.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.080
You’ve earned this, Uhtred.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.080
God is not cruel.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.000
Fight…

12:08.680 --> 12:10.160
as you need to fight.

12:13.520 --> 12:16.680
Well, your grandfather
may have friends anywhere...

12:26.560 --> 12:27.600
We attack.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.400
It will draw in the guard to defend them,

12:31.160 --> 12:32.760
so the women can escape.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.360
Agreed?

12:34.440 --> 12:35.600
Mm.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.400
Your army, Lord King,
they are approaching!

12:41.480 --> 12:44.400
- How far?
- Two, three miles. Soon.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.720
See? We played for time.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.440
Hold your nerve. We will prevail!

12:49.520 --> 12:52.640
- How long till the Saxons breach the gate?
- Also soon.

12:53.200 --> 12:56.760
The gate will hold.
The armies will meet on the field.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.240
Edward will be routed by dusk!

12:59.320 --> 13:01.560
Do not tempt God
with so much pride.

13:01.640 --> 13:02.960
I am proud.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.880
Everything I predicted has come to pass.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.440
He heard of our rebellion,
came to our door.

13:10.520 --> 13:14.400
Rather than act with stealth,
he announced himself!

13:14.480 --> 13:17.560
I tell you, he is impulsive.

13:17.640 --> 13:21.200
Let him push, he will push too hard.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.320
Your army is behind him.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.360
If his pride is his fault,

13:28.960 --> 13:30.760
let him believe he has alarmed us.

13:31.640 --> 13:32.760
Open the sea gate.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.960
Let anyone without the stomach
for a fight leave.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.720
Take men off the gate
and reduce our defenses.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.600
A bold idea, Lord King,

13:40.680 --> 13:44.080
but given that we have provisions
for a siege, should we not--

13:44.160 --> 13:46.280
Sieges are for turds!

13:46.360 --> 13:47.680
Into the yard!

13:55.000 --> 13:57.280
They are pretending
to abandon Bebbanburg.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.640
Edward would not be that stupid.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.320
That will not work.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.040
Will it?

14:03.720 --> 14:06.120
To the ramparts.

14:12.680 --> 14:13.840
Stay back!

14:17.040 --> 14:18.680
Leave us be!

14:21.760 --> 14:24.680
- Did he strike?

14:27.640 --> 14:28.720
No!

14:29.200 --> 14:31.200
- No, please don’t...

14:37.640 --> 14:40.560
Oh, Lord…

14:40.640 --> 14:42.320
Oh, forgive me.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.000
- Thank you.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.800
There’s more. Stay back!

15:04.960 --> 15:06.400
Follow them. Father Pyrlig…

15:38.440 --> 15:41.320
It is foolhardy, Lord King.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.320
Let the soldiers do the fighting.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.880
I never saw you for a coward.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.480
Why have you commanded
to open the sea gate?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.680
Did you find your assassin?

15:53.760 --> 15:56.200
My men flee by the dozen!

15:56.280 --> 15:59.440
Good, fewer to protect here.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.680
Let Edward see us in retreat.
Bring down the men.

16:06.360 --> 16:09.680
You are sworn to him,
but he is sworn to me.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.600
Go.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.240
Pull back!

16:15.320 --> 16:17.920
Pull back. Stand down!

16:18.000 --> 16:19.440
Stand down!

16:34.480 --> 16:36.480
Do not believe it, Edward.

16:46.760 --> 16:47.720
Scots.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.360
Does the king see them?

16:51.560 --> 16:52.640
No.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.440
Men are gathering behind the gates.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.880
They’ll attack them on two fronts!

17:12.079 --> 17:13.839
We’re beating them back.

17:15.599 --> 17:16.560
Lord King!

17:18.640 --> 17:20.839
Soldiers are rowing for their lives
from the sea gate,

17:20.920 --> 17:22.680
grabbing what tiny boats they can.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.560
They are leaving Bebbanburg in droves.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.560
- What has happened within?
- Unknown.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.560
There’s been no word.

17:31.119 --> 17:33.520
- Uhtred has taken command.
- No!

17:34.280 --> 17:36.920
He could not take the fortress
with three men.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.600
We couldn’t take it when we were a dozen.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.960
Nonetheless,
something has happened within.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.000
Stable the horses
and I will lead the men out on foot!

17:46.080 --> 17:49.080
Let us finish this. Ready!

17:49.160 --> 17:50.240
With the king!

17:50.320 --> 17:53.160
Lord King,
the Scots may be closer than we know.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.280
- It's the wrong ground for a battle--
- It's why we strike before they come.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.640
Take the undefended fortress
and fight them from a secure position!

18:00.720 --> 18:02.360
- God is with us, we can do this.
- Lord, no!

18:02.440 --> 18:04.640
You are no warrior! Do not offer counsel!

18:04.720 --> 18:06.320
Leave the battlefield!

18:06.400 --> 18:08.040
I need soldiers who are with me.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.040
Do not come forward!

18:26.680 --> 18:30.440
- Do not shoot!

18:45.040 --> 18:48.120
Remain unseen. Stand by the gate.
Await my command.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.040
Let us view this victory from above,

18:56.000 --> 18:57.640
so we may preside over it.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.400
Men of Wessex!

19:11.560 --> 19:13.400
Men of Mercia!

19:13.480 --> 19:17.480
Now we take Northumbria for England!

19:18.080 --> 19:19.760
Advance!

20:04.520 --> 20:05.560
Lord King!

20:10.880 --> 20:12.560
Shield wall!

20:19.280 --> 20:21.800
- Pull back!
- Get back!

20:25.040 --> 20:26.840
Pull back!

21:15.280 --> 21:16.640
Shield wall!

21:22.440 --> 21:24.600
Father, they will push us into the sea!

21:27.520 --> 21:30.640
Hold the line! Push them back!

21:33.280 --> 21:35.760
You stupid arselings.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.120
Bastards!

21:37.200 --> 21:39.080
Arselings!

21:43.080 --> 21:45.440
Who is that? By the forest?

21:46.400 --> 21:47.880
More Scots?

21:57.360 --> 21:58.400
Push!

22:00.480 --> 22:02.120
Hold them!

22:04.520 --> 22:05.880
Push back!

22:05.960 --> 22:07.360
Push back!

22:26.320 --> 22:28.080
Keep up the pressure!

22:28.160 --> 22:30.000
Push them over the cliff!

22:51.920 --> 22:53.440
Push on!

23:11.640 --> 23:12.480
Aldhelm!

23:15.160 --> 23:16.520
Aldhelm!

23:44.960 --> 23:46.840
Stiorra! Stiorra, turn back!

23:46.920 --> 23:48.720
She says the battle is over, Uhtred.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.800
It is not.
Stiorra, please offer your support!

23:51.880 --> 23:54.160
I plead for my son, do not leave!

23:55.240 --> 23:58.560
Father, the battle cannot be won.
Edward has trapped himself.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.920
- We cannot undo it.
- Let me lead your men.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.360
Lady, do not weaken.
We cannot win this.

24:03.440 --> 24:06.600
I gathered all these men to help.
With all my heart I wanted to,

24:06.680 --> 24:09.560
but we’re too late.
Come with us now. Save yourself.

24:09.640 --> 24:12.240
- He will not leave the field.
- Nor shall we.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.920
It is dangerous, yes.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.840
- But we have to try.
- The risk is too great!

24:16.920 --> 24:18.800
Your brother came here with us!

24:18.880 --> 24:21.200
Aethelstan is on the field.

24:21.280 --> 24:24.000
Aldhelm, Cynlaef,
many who are known to you!

24:24.600 --> 24:27.280
When I married Sigtryggr,
I chose his kin over my own.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.600
Sigtryggr would support me now.
You know this.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.920
He would not ask you to watch
your brother die and turn away.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.920
No Danes should die for Saxons,
not after all they have done to us.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.720
You have suffered at the hands
of Saxon kings, I know this.

24:39.480 --> 24:43.200
I promise, do this
and the Danes will be rewarded.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.800
You cannot promise me anything!

24:50.880 --> 24:53.400
She cannot. It is true.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.520
But I can.

24:56.320 --> 24:59.120
For I speak to you as a man
who has lived among you.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.840
Your gods are my gods.

25:02.520 --> 25:05.440
I was born a Saxon but raised a Dane.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.560
For years that divided me,

25:08.240 --> 25:10.680
but perhaps the Gods have led us all here!

25:11.440 --> 25:13.480
For I will offer you a bargain.

25:13.560 --> 25:18.880
I ask you to fight now
for me and for Northumbria.

25:19.960 --> 25:22.160
And if we take these lands,

25:22.240 --> 25:25.440
we will be taking them
for Saxons and for Danes.

25:26.360 --> 25:30.480
Follow me
and all Danes will live in peace here.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.760
I swear this to you!

25:32.480 --> 25:35.240
Danes will not be hunted,
nor live in forests!

25:35.320 --> 25:38.360
You will have lands and homes!

25:38.440 --> 25:40.920
And I ask you not to do this for Saxons.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.840
Do it for what your forebears
came here for.

25:44.800 --> 25:48.320
For the reason they risked their lives
and crossed the seas

25:49.240 --> 25:50.640
to make a homeland.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.160
Follow me and this I swear.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.600
You have my word…

25:57.640 --> 25:59.440
as a Saxon

25:59.520 --> 26:00.840
and as a Dane!

26:52.960 --> 26:55.480
Sire, we’re fighting on two sides!

27:08.720 --> 27:10.000
Charge!

27:42.080 --> 27:44.040
Charge!

28:09.440 --> 28:11.440
Odin favors us!

28:16.480 --> 28:17.880
Burn the fortress.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.280
I do not want their stronghold
on my border!

28:22.440 --> 28:24.520
Take any hostages you can!

28:35.560 --> 28:40.160
Lord King! Help!

28:45.080 --> 28:49.400
Torch bearers! Stop them!

29:05.600 --> 29:07.120
We must get you to safety.

29:07.200 --> 29:10.360
If your father prevails,
I fear what he may do to you.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.680
- Did they get to safety?
- Yes.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.160
How can I win you the day?

29:33.240 --> 29:36.360
They are taking hostages, do likewise!

29:36.440 --> 29:39.760
Take him, the commander. And find Finan!

29:47.920 --> 29:49.600
They’re retreating!

29:51.840 --> 29:53.360
They’re retreating.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.720
One more step and you will be killed.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.840
You should be pleading for your life.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.200
I know you’re afraid to fight me.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.640
Of course, I’m afraid to fight you.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.520
We are not equals in sword-craft.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.360
So, if you agree to a fair fight…

30:21.440 --> 30:22.400
Ah, yes,

30:23.840 --> 30:25.600
you could never fight with honor.

30:26.640 --> 30:28.280
Honor does not win a fortress.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.120
Uhtred!

31:03.680 --> 31:05.880
Uhtred, do not fight alone!

31:40.120 --> 31:42.160
The stinking turd in his hole,

31:43.200 --> 31:46.040
unable to face the carnage
he has unleashed.

31:51.280 --> 31:54.960
Give me a reason not to cut the eyeballs
from your skull.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.280
Kill him
and I’ll have to fight you.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.080
Please, I beg for his life.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.720
Then you’re a fool,

32:02.440 --> 32:05.600
for he has betrayed you
and Wessex many times.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.920
Ask him whose blood stains his hands!

32:11.000 --> 32:14.600
All I have done has been to protect him.
He knows this!

32:14.680 --> 32:17.640
If he knew all he would not stand by you!

32:19.080 --> 32:20.600
Tell him the worst of it.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.320
Tell him or I shall!

32:26.560 --> 32:29.120
Confess your sins and live,

32:30.040 --> 32:33.080
or die disgraced.

32:43.400 --> 32:46.640
Tell me, what does Aethelstan speak of?

33:17.320 --> 33:21.480
It is a story…

33:23.120 --> 33:24.520
which is hard to understand.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.880
It is not.

33:27.040 --> 33:33.000
- It was for the honor of our bloodline--
- Enough evasion, it sickens me!

33:39.440 --> 33:40.280
Aelfweard,

33:42.200 --> 33:44.560
it will scar your soul to hear this,

33:45.760 --> 33:49.000
but he had your mother killed
to start a war with the Danes.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.760
That is not true!

33:50.840 --> 33:54.200
- All know it.
- And all are wrong!

33:57.360 --> 34:00.160
This has no truth? None at all?

34:01.680 --> 34:06.120
No, it does not. It is…

34:12.200 --> 34:13.440
There is a reason.

34:22.679 --> 34:25.800
She was not the target. It was a tragedy.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.880
She was killed by men you sent?

34:43.600 --> 34:46.840
And you told me that you feared
my father was to blame!

34:46.920 --> 34:49.760
For the blame is his!

34:50.320 --> 34:53.480
His disregard sent her to the pilgrims.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.120
I did not know!

34:55.199 --> 34:58.159
If I had known, never would I…

35:00.639 --> 35:01.840
Never!

35:13.720 --> 35:15.720
Do with him what you will.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.760
Aelfweard, no.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.880
I said you would live if you spoke true

35:23.840 --> 35:25.280
and you did.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.880
Now face the agony you caused.

35:34.480 --> 35:39.520
Tell my grandson I am a man of honor.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.560
Who is the Lord of Bebbanburg?

36:28.640 --> 36:30.520
It belonged to my father!

36:30.600 --> 36:32.640
Who is the true heir?

36:32.720 --> 36:33.920
Say it!

36:36.400 --> 36:37.960
I will never surrender.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.600
Kill me as I killed my father.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.040
That is the legacy of our line!

36:45.120 --> 36:49.240
Do this and your son will kill you.

36:49.320 --> 36:50.920
That is the destiny!

36:53.720 --> 36:55.240
No, it’s not.

37:09.280 --> 37:10.680
Uhtred!

37:45.080 --> 37:47.440
To the sea gate, Lord! Run!

37:48.920 --> 37:51.280
- No, I will not leave and see it burn.
- No!

37:51.360 --> 37:53.880
The smoke will choke you
before the flames even reach. Please!

37:53.960 --> 37:57.600
- The gods will decide my fate.
- If not for yourself then for me!

37:58.440 --> 38:00.760
- Please, just move!
- No!

38:00.840 --> 38:03.840
It is my destiny to die in Bebbanburg!

39:52.280 --> 39:53.600
King Constantin,

39:54.480 --> 39:55.960
welcome to Bebbanburg.

39:58.760 --> 40:00.880
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred,

40:00.960 --> 40:04.120
heir to this fortress
and the lands that surround it.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.200
I acknowledge you as lord of this fortress

40:12.480 --> 40:15.880
and I recognize your authority
over the lands around it.

40:19.120 --> 40:20.280
Can we exchange?

40:22.480 --> 40:24.880
Is he still the man that was captured?

40:25.520 --> 40:28.160
Of course, we’re not savages.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.840
Return our men and you can have him.

40:34.040 --> 40:37.480
Six men for one, even for my nephew,

40:38.400 --> 40:39.600
it’s not a fair price.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.160
I demand you swear to Scotland.

40:47.480 --> 40:48.960
No, that will not be.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.920
These are Saxon lands,
where Danes can thrive.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.560
These lands are disputed.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.600
And I will always claim them.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.400
But I’m ready to accept the offer.

41:09.400 --> 41:13.840
If you were wise, you’d strike a bargain
for a longer peace.

41:14.160 --> 41:15.560
Your men have been defeated.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.280
You have no power to bargain.

41:17.920 --> 41:19.480
I can bring more men.

41:20.160 --> 41:22.360
Lost battles do not mean lost wars.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.720
I’m not afraid to fight you.

41:37.240 --> 41:42.680
If you want to make a longer peace,
I will tell you my terms.

41:45.720 --> 41:46.920
Edward.

41:53.120 --> 41:54.480
The victory was ours.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.480
You could say that, Lord King.

43:09.920 --> 43:14.760
Hey! All stand for the king!

43:21.760 --> 43:26.240
My son, who has led us to such victory!

43:42.800 --> 43:44.560
Your heroism on the field of battle

43:44.640 --> 43:47.000
will live on in the songs
and in the chronicles.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.520
To you, we owe our life.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.160
Also to the Danes, Lord King.

43:57.040 --> 43:58.840
Yes, also to the Danes.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.400
Who may live in these lands in peace.

44:05.760 --> 44:08.000
Lord Uhtred of Northumbria,

44:09.920 --> 44:12.640
I congratulate you
on restoring your birthright.

44:14.200 --> 44:17.360
You honor your children
and bring them solace and healing.

44:19.640 --> 44:22.920
May these lands be held
by your descendants for all eternity.

44:25.280 --> 44:29.400
Let the sons of your sons profit
for generations!

44:40.480 --> 44:42.240
Why are we going to the fortress?

44:42.320 --> 44:44.320
To meet the Lord of Bebbanburg.

44:44.400 --> 44:45.400
Why?

44:46.880 --> 44:49.000
Is this a trick
to make me learn scripture?

44:49.080 --> 44:51.440
I know better than that, Osbert.

44:51.920 --> 44:54.040
No, I made a little inquiry

44:54.120 --> 44:59.560
and I think the new lord might be able
to tell you something of your origins.

45:00.480 --> 45:03.000
You think he may have once met my father?

45:03.920 --> 45:07.480
Yes. Something like that.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.520
Oh!

45:35.040 --> 45:38.480
You were worth the fight, my dearest girl.

45:39.800 --> 45:42.880
Your mother would be proud.

45:45.120 --> 45:46.880
I have a gift for you.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.280
How are the wounded?

46:02.680 --> 46:05.040
Some will take a while to recover.

46:05.680 --> 46:09.920
Perhaps you might... stay
and care for them here at Bebbanburg.

46:11.960 --> 46:12.960
Perhaps.

46:14.280 --> 46:16.920
I think that is an excellent idea.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.600
The sea air is very good
for all manners of illness.

46:21.320 --> 46:25.360
I shall of course need rooms
with a sea view.

47:18.360 --> 47:20.640
We will feast like brothers.

47:21.200 --> 47:25.120
For truly what you have done for my family
cannot be matched in many lifetimes.

47:25.880 --> 47:27.480
The debt is ours.

47:28.720 --> 47:31.760
We will feast and then I shall accept
your oath before the people.

47:32.360 --> 47:35.960
We will share the moment
England is finally made whole

47:36.040 --> 47:38.120
and defeat the Scottish claim forever.

47:41.920 --> 47:44.960
Constantin has withdrawn his claim
to these lands.

47:48.040 --> 47:49.160
Why would he do that?

47:51.000 --> 47:53.920
Because I offered
not to cede these lands to you.

47:56.080 --> 48:01.160
Instead we will remain between the two,
sworn to neither, to ensure peace.

48:01.240 --> 48:03.560
The people here are Saxon in their blood.

48:03.640 --> 48:06.640
Indeed, but they’re not part
of your kingdom.

48:08.040 --> 48:11.360
We recognize you as our overlord
and we will pay you homage,

48:12.000 --> 48:15.440
but these lands will remain Northumbria's
and Northumbria's alone.

48:16.640 --> 48:19.360
They will not become part of England
in your lifetime.

48:22.560 --> 48:24.560
After everything we’ve given you,

48:25.560 --> 48:28.680
you choose now
to betray the House of Wessex?

48:28.760 --> 48:32.920
I betray nothing. The House of Wessex will
unite England eventually, I’m sure of it.

48:35.120 --> 48:38.080
I believe you are the true king
of the lands you hold,

48:38.840 --> 48:41.760
but the man who can unify this country
must be a figure

48:41.840 --> 48:45.040
behind which the people
can stand together as one.

48:47.400 --> 48:49.640
You have shown that you are not that man.

48:50.960 --> 48:54.040
You have sown discord
between Saxon and Dane.

48:57.200 --> 49:01.520
The future will come. Wait for it.

49:15.320 --> 49:16.600
Hey!

49:24.440 --> 49:25.640
To Bebbanburg!

49:25.720 --> 49:28.800
- To Bebbanburg!

49:37.120 --> 49:43.080
Uhtred! Uhtred!
Uhtred! Uhtred! Uhtred! Uhtred!

49:43.160 --> 49:48.240
Uhtred! Uhtred! Uhtred! Uhtred!
Uhtred! Uhtred! Uhtred! Uhtred...

49:48.320 --> 49:51.080
<i>I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

49:52.680 --> 49:54.880
<i>I was torn from my birthright</i>

49:54.960 --> 49:58.560
<i>and cursed to wander these lands</i>
<i>for many years.</i>

50:00.840 --> 50:03.840
<i>But now, as Lord of Northumbria,</i>

50:03.920 --> 50:06.840
<i>I am a thorn in the side</i>
<i>of the House of Wessex.</i>

50:12.880 --> 50:16.680
<i>I am all that stands between them</i>
<i>and a united England.</i>

50:24.680 --> 50:28.280
<i>Will Alfred's dream</i>
<i>be fulfilled in my lifetime?</i>

50:31.400 --> 50:34.680
<i>And if so, who will rule here?</i>

50:41.240 --> 50:43.200
<i>Will blood prevail?</i>

50:45.360 --> 50:48.960
<i>Or will king slay king once again</i>
<i>on the battlefield?</i>

50:58.160 --> 51:01.120
<i>I do not know what the gods choose.</i>

51:09.200 --> 51:11.560
<i>But now I am more certain</i>

51:11.640 --> 51:13.640
<i>they are on my side.</i>

51:15.000 --> 51:19.120
<i>And though my story has been woven</i>
<i>by hands that are not my own,</i>

51:20.360 --> 51:23.760
<i>the words I live by still stand true.</i>

51:25.960 --> 51:28.440
<i>I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

51:28.920 --> 51:31.400
<i>For you and for myself…</i>

51:32.840 --> 51:35.480
<i>destiny is all!</i>
