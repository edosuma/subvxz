WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:04.305
Okay, I think we got
everything we need

00:04.338 --> 00:06.207
for the Valentine's Day
dinner.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.077
We got tablecloths,
sparkling grape juice,

00:09.110 --> 00:10.478
and a Doomsday pamphlet

00:10.511 --> 00:11.912
I got from that weird guy
in the parking lot

00:11.945 --> 00:13.381
that I folded
into a swan.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.049
Oh.
This is gonna be awesome.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.317
Is it?
'Cause to remind you,

00:16.350 --> 00:17.818
it is dinner cooked
by our kids

00:17.851 --> 00:19.420
at the school
on Valentine's night.

00:19.453 --> 00:22.156
Could anything kill
sexual energy faster?
What?

00:22.190 --> 00:24.692
Chez Second Grade
is hella sexy.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.527
Wait,
that's inappropriate.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.661
Off the record.
Off the record!

00:27.695 --> 00:28.929
Besides, if you
didn't want to do it,

00:28.962 --> 00:30.431
you shouldn't have volunteered
to run it with me.

00:30.464 --> 00:33.033
I didn't.
You signed me up.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.236
Now I got to spend
this holiday with all
the people I hate most --

00:35.269 --> 00:36.437
the parents in our class.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.505
What about
that new single dad

00:37.538 --> 00:39.107
everybody's
going crazy for?

00:39.140 --> 00:41.041
The one with the messenger bag
I can't seem to find online.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.443
Colin?
The British guy?

00:42.476 --> 00:43.944
He is so awkward
around me.

00:43.977 --> 00:46.046
We had one run-in
at the gas station,

00:46.080 --> 00:48.449
and he brings it up
every time I see him.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.284
It's like,
"Move on with your life."

00:50.318 --> 00:51.452
Okay, who cares
about the other parents?

00:51.485 --> 00:53.354
The important thing is
we're hanging out again.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.457
Sorry we had to take a break
while I was seeing Tracy.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.525
But then she dumped ya butt.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.860
She did.
She dumped ma butt.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.096
So tomorrow, I'm gonna make up
for being a bad friend.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.431
Will and Angie are back.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.533
In fact, the new teaser
for "Joust!" just came out.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.700
Do you want to watch it
a hundred times?

01:06.734 --> 01:08.369
Let's take it slow.
Okay.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.470
Wait, what is this?

01:09.503 --> 01:11.539
Batteries, tampons,
smoke alarms?

01:11.572 --> 01:12.906
These things
weren't on the list.

01:12.940 --> 01:15.976
Yeah, it's on the PTA
for letting me use
their credit card.

01:16.009 --> 01:19.079
-- Captions by VITAC --

01:25.286 --> 01:26.620
Hey.

01:26.654 --> 01:27.821
* Lady in red *

01:27.855 --> 01:29.457
Douglas:
Good afternoon, my love.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.558
What's happening?

01:30.591 --> 01:31.959
Are you
"Lady in Red"-ing me?

01:31.992 --> 01:34.061
You're damn right I am.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.663
Valentine's Day,

01:35.696 --> 01:37.765
you're a woman,
and I am prepared.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.633
Got the bear,
got the card,

01:39.667 --> 01:41.135
got enough chocolate

01:41.169 --> 01:43.337
to turn that Hotel for Dogs
into Jonestown.

01:43.371 --> 01:44.938
Douglas, we don't need
to do this.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.340
You're dating a woman
who doesn't subscribe

01:46.374 --> 01:47.775
to archaic cultural norms,
okay?

01:47.808 --> 01:49.109
I'm evolved.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.779
Oh, you are.
But evolved from whom?

01:51.812 --> 01:52.780
Athena?

01:52.813 --> 01:55.149
Persephone? Aphrodite?

01:55.183 --> 01:56.950
Those are Greek broads.
Oh!

01:56.984 --> 01:59.287
You were doing so well.
You should've just stopped.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.155
Oh, oh, you know what?
I gotta go.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.956
Love you.
Love you too.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.459
Your next patient is
in the Choo-Choo Room.

02:05.493 --> 02:08.196
Okay, for the last time,
it's called Exam Room Two.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.664
No.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.667
Big Red:
Ding-dong, Chipmunk.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.304
Big Red.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.805
I'm here for a skin check.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.674
I've been sizzling
in the Panamanian sun
for the past year,

02:20.708 --> 02:22.676
and...
I'm cooked through.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.179
Even the thick parts.
A year?

02:25.213 --> 02:27.815
I-I thought your trip was
supposed to last five months.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.183
I was sex trafficked.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.219
Voluntarily.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.656
Something's different.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.291
You're in
a relationship now.

02:38.559 --> 02:42.062
She has a small business
and has a child

02:42.095 --> 02:43.731
who will host
the Thanksgiving Day Parade

02:43.764 --> 02:44.865
in about 20 years.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.133
Y-You know,
I could refer you

02:46.166 --> 02:48.636
to some fantastic
dermatologists.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.137
Oh!

02:50.170 --> 02:52.973
I dig. I dig.
If your gal finds out

02:53.006 --> 02:54.675
that you're here with me,
she's gonna scream so loud

02:54.708 --> 02:55.876
her ass'll fall out.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.479
Oh, God,
you paint with words.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.314
A-And as far as
my lady friend,

03:00.348 --> 03:02.816
she would handle it
perfectly fine.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.552
You see, she is
an evolved woman.

03:04.585 --> 03:05.986
I don't care who she is.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.657
When a woman is in love,
she's jealous.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.226
Well,
we are deeply in love.
Are you sure?

03:12.260 --> 03:14.562
Sounds like maybe
her jets have cooled.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.163
You're wrong.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.433
Her jets are...firing.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.935
Oh, you like jets,
do you?

03:21.969 --> 03:24.171
How about
a couple of jumbos?

03:24.204 --> 03:27.040
A-A-Assist! Stacy!
Female assist!

03:27.074 --> 03:28.909
Alright, folks.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.911
The name of the game
is tips.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.746
That's why we've got you
bartending, Graham.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.948
I don't know
how to bartend.
It's simple.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.183
Bat those doe eyes,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.252
agree with everything
the customer says,

03:38.286 --> 03:42.890
and when in doubt, always say,
"I hear you, partner."

03:43.624 --> 03:45.759
Now, where's my fiddler?
Sophie: I keep telling you,

03:45.793 --> 03:47.628
I don't know
how to play violin.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.196
I play the clarinet.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.531
And I keep telling you --

03:50.564 --> 03:52.600
nobody's smooching
to a woodwind.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.268
It's Valentine's Day.

03:54.302 --> 03:57.137
Wet lips get tips.
Now hit it.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.619
Hey.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.786
Homily's got strep,

04:12.820 --> 04:14.254
so she asked me
to help out in the kitchen.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.324
Doesn't that mean
you have strep?

04:16.357 --> 04:17.958
Nah, just a fever.
Hurts when I swallow.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.460
Tell me where to go.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.929
Miggy,
give us a moment.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.431
What should we do?

04:23.464 --> 04:25.065
He sounds contagious,
but we're understaffed.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.133
I know.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.735
Let's roll the dice,
man.

04:27.768 --> 04:28.969
I-I'm not eating
any of that crap.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.304
Are you?
Definitely not.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.639
Miggy,
hit the kitchen.

04:31.672 --> 04:32.906
Cool.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.944
Oh, God.
There's the new British dad.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.278
Will, look away.
Look away.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.448
Hi, Angie. Will.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.516
Hi, Colin.
Remember
the gas station?

04:42.550 --> 04:44.084
We met there.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.786
Yep. Yeah, we've been
over this, Angie.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.287
Several times.

04:47.321 --> 04:50.624
Well, I was getting gas.
To put in my gas hole.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.526
You keep calling it that.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.795
It's accurate, but odd.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.797
I don't know if you've
been by our old hang,

04:56.830 --> 04:58.866
but, whoa, is there news
at the gas station.

04:58.899 --> 05:02.336
They have,
uh, Danishes.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.705
I can buy you one.
You...

05:04.738 --> 05:06.474
What is happening
right now?

05:06.507 --> 05:08.676
We cannot seem to let go
of the gas station.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.278
I just pray one day I'll
be released from this hell.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.380
Oh.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.481
Hey,
you like scratchers?

05:13.514 --> 05:15.048
Beep, beep!
Honk, honk!

05:15.082 --> 05:16.517
$30 on six!

05:16.550 --> 05:18.018
Oh, my God.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.787
The weird thing is,

05:19.820 --> 05:22.623
I-I rehearsed that conversation
like a thousand times.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.792
Every time I'm around him,
I just melt.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.727
I'm probably overreacting.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.861
It wasn't
that bad, right?

05:27.895 --> 05:30.698
Angie.
You called it a "gas hole."

05:33.501 --> 05:36.837
Bonjour.
Welcome to Chez Second Grade.

05:36.870 --> 05:37.971
Name?

05:38.005 --> 05:39.306
You know who we are.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.674
You made me
carry you inside

05:40.708 --> 05:42.342
so you wouldn't get
your shoes dirty.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.811
Name?

05:43.844 --> 05:45.245
It's easier if we
just play along.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.547
Poppy Banks.
Ah.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.981
Banks, Banks, Poppy...

05:48.015 --> 05:49.182
Yeah, no,
I'm not seeing it.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.317
Well, you better see it.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.219
We put down
a $60 deposit.

05:52.252 --> 05:53.487
Oh, here it is.
Ooh.

05:53.521 --> 05:56.223
Ooh.
Sorry, but looks like

05:56.256 --> 05:57.425
we had to give
your table away.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.759
VIP showed up.

05:58.792 --> 06:02.396
But maybe we could
work something out.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.399
Rory,
I'm not tipping you.
Fine.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.035
Then you can go...
stand by the bar.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.971
With the rest
of the Valley trash.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.443
You okay?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.277
You seem a bit on edge.
Yeah.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.212
I just need to tell you
about something,

06:19.246 --> 06:21.515
and I-I'm really not sure
how you're gonna react.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.050
Oh, God.
You voted for him, didn't you?

06:23.083 --> 06:24.918
I knew it.
I was too scared to ask.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.954
N-No, no.
It's -- It's about today.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.957
Uh, Big Red showed up
to get some moles checked,

06:29.990 --> 06:31.692
and, uh,
before I could escape

06:31.725 --> 06:33.927
from the Choo-Choo Room --
Dammit, Stacy! --

06:33.961 --> 06:38.298
uh, she dropped her gown,
and, um, I saw everything.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.300
Oh, my God.
Now, relax.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.802
There is no need
to be jealous.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.203
I'm not jealous.
I'm worried.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.271
Is her skin okay?

06:44.304 --> 06:46.273
You're not mad?
Why would I be mad?

06:46.306 --> 06:48.075
You're a doctor
doing your job.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.477
R-Right. Okay.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.144
Alright.
That -- That's wonderful.

06:52.112 --> 06:56.116
I'm -- I'm very happy with,
uh...with your reaction.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.785
Rory,
how's the table coming?

06:57.818 --> 06:59.352
Name?

07:02.289 --> 07:03.791
You doing okay, Angie?

07:03.824 --> 07:06.126
I'm still spiraling
about Colin.

07:06.159 --> 07:09.162
I haven't even tried the
Danishes at the gas station.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.298
I can't vouch for them.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.300
What if he tries one
a-a-and it's bad?

07:13.333 --> 07:14.334
I'll look so stupid.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.169
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.739
Gotta say, I've never seen you
this frazzled over a guy before.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.674
Well, except for the guy
who delivers the circulars.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.276
Danny.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.583
Oh. Danny.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.785
Looks like we're
both early birds, hmm?

07:31.819 --> 07:35.589
Thanks.
You know, you seem so handy.

07:35.623 --> 07:36.957
Any chance
you know how to fix

07:36.990 --> 07:39.159
a broken
bedside table lamp?

07:39.192 --> 07:41.629
'Cause I have
a broken bedside table lamp.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.930
It's by my bed.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.464
Sorry. I'm not very good
with that stuff.

07:44.498 --> 07:45.966
Okay.

07:45.999 --> 07:49.102
Oh, watch out
for the sprinkler!

07:49.136 --> 07:52.272
Oops. Gotcha again.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.342
You know, I'm starting to think
Danny might not be interested.

07:55.375 --> 07:58.011
Uh, cha-yeah.
He's way out of both
of our leagues,

07:58.045 --> 07:59.312
but Colin
would be great for you.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.048
I know, bro.
He's perfect.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.216
He's like if Paddington
were a man.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.052
Hey, why don't I
talk to Colin?

08:05.085 --> 08:07.655
You know, one hot dad
to another.

08:07.688 --> 08:08.989
Let me do this for you.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.791
No, I don't want you
to do anything for me.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.160
You know, right now,
I could be home,

08:13.193 --> 08:15.829
opening cans of Friskies
to meet the neighborhood cats.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.065
Just stay out of it.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.402
You know, Miggy,
if I fix this,

08:22.435 --> 08:23.737
she's gonna thank me
later.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.205
Fo sho, so sho.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.140
Also,
my ears are plugged up.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.208
I didn't hear
any of that.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.643
Are you sure
you're feeling alright?

08:29.677 --> 08:31.712
You know
that pot is empty.

08:34.915 --> 08:37.150
I'm hoping this doesn't last
more than an hour.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.987
Hey, Colin. Sorry.
Could I talk to you for a sec?

08:40.020 --> 08:43.323
Ah. For the last time,
the -- the bag was a gift.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.692
I don't know
where it's from.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.765
That's your fourth milk.
You might wanna slow down.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.767
I can handle it.
I took a Lactaid.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.168
You sure you're okay?

08:55.202 --> 08:56.604
Of course I'm okay.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.506
I can't believe they're charging
market prices for fish sticks.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.609
It's for
a good cause, Douglas.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.110
I mean, it's --

09:03.143 --> 09:04.912
A wine fridge
in the faculty lounge?

09:04.945 --> 09:06.213
Oh, hell no.
That's crazy.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.481
I'm getting to the bottom
of this.

09:09.617 --> 09:13.220
Barkeep.
One more.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.125
Tough day?

09:18.158 --> 09:19.292
You don't know
the half of it.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.328
I hear you, partner.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.132
Graham,
can I confide in you?

09:25.165 --> 09:26.700
That's what I'm here for.

09:26.734 --> 09:29.770
I saw Big Red today,
and I told Poppy,

09:29.803 --> 09:31.438
and she didn't even
get jealous.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.775
She didn't get jealous?
That's not great.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.878
Exactly, and it's only
been six months.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.547
She's probably
over it already.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.616
When you're right,
you're right.
I don't know.

09:42.650 --> 09:43.951
Maybe she's lost
the passion,

09:43.984 --> 09:45.886
and what's a relationship
without passion?

09:45.919 --> 09:48.121
Without passion,
ya dead.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.791
Okay. So, that's it.
She's over me.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.460
You know what?
You hit me with some
tough things today, kid,

09:53.493 --> 09:55.262
but I needed to hear it.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.930
Let's settle up.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.433
Milk is $9?

10:00.467 --> 10:03.203
Gratuity not included.

10:08.475 --> 10:11.144
Okay.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.248
Your rabbit food
is done.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.117
You drenched this
in balsamic!

10:17.150 --> 10:18.285
We were trying
to drown it.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.787
It was a mercy killing.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.355
Miggy was supposed to be
helping you with this,

10:22.389 --> 10:23.623
and where is Will?

10:23.657 --> 10:26.026
He disappeared
20 minutes ago!

10:26.059 --> 10:28.161
So, she was flirting
with me?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.197
She was so off-putting.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.432
Yeah.
That's an American thing.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.135
It's actually considered
very sexy here.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.937
We also let people die if they
don't have health insurance,

10:36.970 --> 10:40.040
but, trust me,
she's into you.
Really?

10:40.073 --> 10:41.474
Well, to tell you
the truth,

10:41.508 --> 10:44.011
I do find her quite...
fetching.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.279
I thought she hated me,

10:46.313 --> 10:47.715
the way she kept
torturing me

10:47.748 --> 10:49.549
with stories
about the gas station.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.786
Yeah. I can see how
you got there.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.287
But give her a chance

10:54.321 --> 10:56.456
because she's actually
really great when
you get to know her.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.292
Is that her,
sputtering from the shadows?

10:59.326 --> 11:00.794
Oh, my God.
She's sweating.

11:00.828 --> 11:03.063
Without turning around,
I'm gonna say, yes, that's her.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.197
Be back in a jiff.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.467
Now, I trust this table
suits the both of you?

11:07.500 --> 11:08.902
Right next
to the restrooms. Okay.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.170
Yes.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.373
I did not hear the sink.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.374
Oh.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.709
Alright, I am starved.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.812
Uh, you want to split
the spaghetti and jello?

11:18.846 --> 11:20.080
Poppy, we need to talk.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.816
Um, Graham and I -- we --
we had a few belts,

11:22.850 --> 11:24.852
and he said -- and --
and now, these are his words,

11:24.885 --> 11:28.155
not mine -- that, um...

11:28.188 --> 11:30.657
our relationship
is dead.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.725
Aw, such a sweet boy.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.093
Wait, what?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.394
I told you about Big Red,

11:34.427 --> 11:36.096
and you weren't even fazed
at all.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.498
Why weren't you jealous?
Well, should I be?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.267
Did something happen?
No.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.701
Oh.
Then why would I be jealous?

11:41.735 --> 11:44.004
Because you love me.
Supposedly.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.873
Excuse me?

11:45.906 --> 11:48.208
S-Sophie, d-do you mind?

11:48.241 --> 11:49.376
We're in the middle
of a thing here.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.278
If I don't finish
this song,

11:51.311 --> 11:52.880
I'm gonna get it
from my manager.

11:52.913 --> 11:56.683
Here. Find another table.
There you go.

11:56.716 --> 12:00.720
Look...the passion
is obviously gone for you.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.455
I mean, if I found out
that one of your exes

12:02.489 --> 12:05.625
showed up at the Winebrary
and took his clothes off --

12:05.658 --> 12:06.927
Yeah, I'd call the cops

12:06.960 --> 12:08.796
because there'd be a naked man
at a feminist bookstore,

12:08.829 --> 12:10.798
or a woman, based on that
one time I studied abroad.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.966
Really?
Th-- No, you know what?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.802
Don't distract me
while we're arguing.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.304
The point is I
would have been riled up

12:17.337 --> 12:20.073
because I would have wanted you
to know that I cared.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.742
Douglas, if me being
a jealous, crazy person

12:22.776 --> 12:24.978
is the only way that
you know I care about you,

12:25.012 --> 12:26.213
then I feel sorry for you.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.614
Oh, so, now you
feel sorry for me?

12:27.647 --> 12:28.648
Yeah, it's sad.

12:28.681 --> 12:31.418
Then I guess
I'm just a sad man.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.719
Douglas.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.121
I'm walking out the door.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.894
The coats
have disappeared.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.837
Girls, that is
for the parents.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.638
Get that bread
on some tables now.

12:51.671 --> 12:54.574
We're starving.
Is someone gonna check
on Miggy?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.509
Just gonna take
a little cat nap.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.011
Up in no time.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.512
Miggy, you're sick.
Go home.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.248
No, he is fine.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.782
What the hell, Will?

13:02.816 --> 13:04.952
What is the big deal?
You like Colin.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.619
Now, thanks to me,
he knows that.

13:06.653 --> 13:07.921
He does?

13:07.955 --> 13:10.157
What are you thinking?!

13:10.190 --> 13:11.925
God, this is
none of your business.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.961
Of course it is.
You're my best friend.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.462
Look, I know we took a break,
but I'm trying --

13:15.495 --> 13:18.131
Will, we haven't talked
in forever.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.300
You were busy with Tracy

13:20.333 --> 13:21.634
and then busy
getting over Tracy,

13:21.668 --> 13:23.770
and I was over here
doing my own thing.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.638
Did you even know
that I ate

13:25.672 --> 13:27.307
one of those jumbo barrels
of Chex Mix?

13:27.340 --> 13:30.310
Yeah. And I think I did
permanent damage to my colon.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.811
I'm seeing a specialist.

13:31.845 --> 13:32.980
Okay.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.982
Well, I've been
through stuff, too.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.050
I had a very serious girlfriend
for two hours,

13:37.084 --> 13:38.618
whose name escapes me
right now.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.021
Well, you missed when I got
really into "Pokémon Go."

13:41.054 --> 13:42.622
I got hit by a car.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.790
You think that's something?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.792
I actually hit a woman
with my ca--

13:45.825 --> 13:47.294
Oh, my gosh, Angie.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.795
Why did you run
into the woods?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.797
Yeah, I'm Italian!
By the way...

13:50.830 --> 13:54.567
Graham hung out with his dad,

13:54.601 --> 13:56.336
and you never even asked me
about that.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.471
Do you know who helped me
through that?

13:58.505 --> 13:59.806
Douglas.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.975
Do you have any idea
how hard-up you have to be

14:02.009 --> 14:03.210
to lean on Douglas?

14:03.243 --> 14:05.812
Angie, I'm sorry, okay?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.480
I wish I had been there
for that,

14:07.514 --> 14:10.083
and I really wish
I hadn't hit you with my car.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.718
But I'm here now.

14:11.751 --> 14:14.354
And -- And that's what tonight
was supposed to be about.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.822
You can't just snap
your fingers and expect us

14:15.855 --> 14:17.224
to go back
to right where we were.

14:17.257 --> 14:18.458
I'm gonna get some air.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.461
Angie...

14:24.631 --> 14:25.966
Colin called you
"fetching."

14:27.400 --> 14:28.768
Of course he did.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.570
I'm fetching as hell.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.108
Hey, Will,
is this a bad time?

14:35.142 --> 14:37.677
Kinda.
Do you really need me?

14:37.710 --> 14:40.347
Eh. We're good.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.888
Colin: Angie?

14:48.922 --> 14:50.290
Are you, uh...

14:50.323 --> 14:52.025
headed to your car?

14:52.059 --> 14:53.093
Oh, no.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.127
Am I giving you a segue

14:54.161 --> 14:55.262
to talk about the gas station?

14:55.295 --> 14:56.729
I don't think I
can handle that right now.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.532
No.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.600
I'm too tired

15:00.633 --> 15:03.370
to be weird around you
right now.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.906
Is there...any world

15:06.940 --> 15:08.942
where there's alcohol
in that?

15:08.976 --> 15:09.977
That depends.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.044
Would that be something

15:11.078 --> 15:12.779
that you
would judge me for?

15:12.812 --> 15:14.948
You clearly
don't know me at all.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.818
Oh.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.387
Wow. Ooh.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.755
It's straight vodka.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.257
Yeah, I used one
of those plungers

15:24.291 --> 15:26.126
that you get in a box
of children's medicine.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.260
I use a funnel.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.965
I'm sorry that I've...

15:31.999 --> 15:33.733
acted so strangely.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.970
I, uh...I'm
on serious medication

15:37.004 --> 15:39.139
for a self-inflicted
digestive issue.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.974
And also...

15:41.008 --> 15:43.443
you make me nervous.

15:46.879 --> 15:49.416
Well, if it's
any consolation,

15:49.449 --> 15:51.018
I'm new to being single.

15:51.051 --> 15:54.354
I'm  not really
that good at this, either.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.456
You're okay.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.126
You know, Will said some really
interesting things about you.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.294
Well, don't believe him.
He's lying.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.663
He's trying to destroy me.
No.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.665
He said that
you're incredibly kind,

16:05.698 --> 16:09.636
and that you're raising
a wonderful kid.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.938
Despite the fact
that you've been

16:11.971 --> 16:13.806
to two
Good Charlotte concerts.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.844
And that no matter what,
you're always there for him.

16:17.877 --> 16:20.480
He would know.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.482
He's my best friend.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.052
He's, like, you know,

16:25.085 --> 16:26.619
the kind of guy
you want to hang out with

16:26.653 --> 16:27.687
at a gas station.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.621
And we're back.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.822
I almost made it.
Yeah.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.724
So close.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.827
I'm gonna go back in.

16:34.861 --> 16:36.163
I think Will needs
my help.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.133
Thank you.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.102
Strong.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.873
Do you really think
I'm fetching?

16:48.775 --> 16:50.977
Yes.

17:00.887 --> 17:03.690
I don't know why
you guys are cheering.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.692
It's pretty obvious this dinner
isn't going to happen.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.660
And someone
needs to take Miggy home.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.063
We're taking care of it.
Eat the soup!

17:10.097 --> 17:13.100
Alright, let's go tell
these parents to go home.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.934
Angie:
No one's going anywhere!

17:14.967 --> 17:16.869
Will and Angie are back!

17:16.903 --> 17:18.871
It's dinnertime, bitches!

17:18.905 --> 17:21.074
Not you.
Let's go!

17:22.242 --> 17:24.777
No, "Chez Second Grade."

17:24.811 --> 17:26.779
That's a fraudulent charge.
But --

17:26.813 --> 17:28.615
No, my credit card
wasn't stolen.

17:28.648 --> 17:31.384
I just don't think that I should
have to pay for it.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.127
Listen,
I-I-I'm obviously sorry

17:40.160 --> 17:42.129
for how I behaved earlier.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.597
I'm -- I'm embarrassed.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.100
Look, Douglas,
you know I love you,

17:47.134 --> 17:48.768
and me not getting jealous
is proof of that.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.870
It means I trust you.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.739
You're right.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.107
It's just Graham,
you know?

17:54.141 --> 17:55.742
He got me
all turned around.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.111
I just wanted to have
a nice conversation,

17:58.145 --> 17:59.446
but he wouldn't let it go.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.781
Eh, but to be honest,
he's Italian, you know?

18:01.814 --> 18:03.616
They're not over the war.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.917
So, to be clear,
you're gonna blame

18:04.951 --> 18:06.386
your behavior tonight
on Graham?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.121
Most of it. Yes.

18:08.155 --> 18:12.725
And maybe it was me
a little, too.
Uh-huh.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.127
Poppy, look, I am --

18:14.161 --> 18:16.496
I'm just not used
to dating a woman like you,

18:16.529 --> 18:21.634
so put together, so steady,
so age-appropriate.

18:21.668 --> 18:22.802
Let's not get it
twisted.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.003
I'm still way too young
for you.

18:24.036 --> 18:25.772
And, look, I'm sorry.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.641
I'm never gonna be
that...crazy woman

18:28.675 --> 18:30.243
you may have wanted
in the past.

18:30.277 --> 18:33.946
But there's still other ways
we can keep it hot.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.915
Ooh.

18:35.948 --> 18:36.949
Mm.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.152
I think I'll go run a bath.

18:40.153 --> 18:43.790
And I also ordered
some spicy Thai food.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.693
Thank you. Because you know
I ate nothing at that dinner.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.763
Ah.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.131
I'm looking for Chipmunk.

18:53.032 --> 18:55.101
It's a mole thing.
Oh.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.804
Okay.
Let me just get him.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.439
You know what?
Actually, no.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.807
I'm not buying
this mole thing.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.042
But you're very fair,
so I hope you use sunscreen.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.312
I use Crisco.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.779
Look, I don't want to
bloody my knuckles,

19:06.813 --> 19:08.481
so you've got five seconds
to get out of my sight,

19:08.515 --> 19:09.949
'cause it's Valentine's Day

19:09.982 --> 19:11.351
and I'm gonna eat
Thai food with my man.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.553
Then we might take a bath,
but probably a shower

19:13.586 --> 19:16.323
because we've tried it and we
both can't fit in the tub.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.390
Wow.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.992
Was that the food?
Uh, yeah.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.794
Yeah, they forgot
the chopsticks,

19:21.828 --> 19:23.363
so I sent them back.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.365
Of course you did.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.172
Thanks for coming back.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.741
I-I think you were right.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.909
I can't just
snap my fingers

19:36.943 --> 19:38.311
and get us back
to where we were.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.981
Hey. Look at this dinner
we put together.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.550
I think we already have.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.717
Colin: Hey, Angie.

19:44.751 --> 19:45.918
You ready?

19:45.952 --> 19:48.020
Sorry, Will, I would help
with the cleanup,

19:48.054 --> 19:49.322
but, um...

19:49.356 --> 19:50.823
Oh, God.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.425
I should've had an excuse
ready to go.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.561
Are you cool
if I head out?

19:54.594 --> 19:55.862
'Course. Yeah.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.230
Enjoy your evening

19:57.264 --> 19:59.699
with Hilltop's second-hottest
single dad.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.067
Who's the first?
Hmm.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.370
Solid burn.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.604
Happy Valentine's Day, Ang.

20:04.637 --> 20:05.605
You too.

20:07.607 --> 20:08.775
Hey.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.386
Nightcap, chief?

20:19.419 --> 20:21.354
Yeah, it's been a long night.
I could use one.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.655
Well, the bar's closed.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.396
Oh, my God.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.032
Danny.
Is Angie here?

20:33.065 --> 20:35.768
I got something important
I want to say to her.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.404
Aw, bud.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.905
She left with someone else.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.442
I'm too late.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.681
That poor, beautiful boy.

20:52.485 --> 20:53.720
Oh, hey, Graham.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.888
Hey, Poppy.
How was your Valentine's Day?

20:55.922 --> 20:57.324
Really nice.
And yours?

20:57.357 --> 20:58.825
Rory took most of my tips,

20:58.858 --> 21:01.461
but I still had enough
for these.

21:01.494 --> 21:02.629
New laces.

21:03.830 --> 21:04.997
Well, they're playing
my song.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.566
Gotta go.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.468
One more thing.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.637
I know you're trying
to break me and Douglas up,

21:10.670 --> 21:12.071
but it's not gonna work.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.806
But I-I was just --

21:13.840 --> 21:14.874
Shh, shh!

21:15.775 --> 21:16.709
Run along now.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.413
Like a son to me.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.384
Mm.
