00:02.393 --> 00:03.873
Previously onMom...

00:03.960 --> 00:06.093
I got a job.For money?

00:06.180 --> 00:07.485
Even better.

00:07.572 --> 00:08.704
[keys jingling]

00:08.791 --> 00:12.012
They'’re paying you in keys?

00:12.099 --> 00:14.536
No, I'’m managing
an apartment building.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.538
They'’re paying me
with a free apartment.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.801
We have a home.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.411
Oh, Mom!

00:20.498 --> 00:21.978
That'’s incredible!

00:22.065 --> 00:24.154
I know![both laughing]

00:24.241 --> 00:25.764
Wait, wait.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.331
Do you know how to manage
an apartment building?

00:27.418 --> 00:30.247
I do not.

00:30.334 --> 00:32.423
You know, I'’m thinking
somewhere down the road,

00:32.509 --> 00:34.512
we buy a nice fold-out couch
for the living room.

00:34.599 --> 00:35.731
You'’ll be a lot
more comfortable.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.254
Wait, what?

00:37.341 --> 00:38.995
I thought you were sleeping
on the couch.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.866
Oh, you'’re adorable.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.653
I found the apartment.
I get the master.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.133
Yeah, but...I saved us.

00:46.220 --> 00:47.351
I know, it'’s just...

00:47.438 --> 00:48.613
After you put us
out on the street.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.746
Yeah, but I...But what?

00:52.443 --> 00:55.185
But I don'’t want
to sleep on the couch.

00:55.272 --> 00:56.882
You want to swap with Roscoe?

00:56.969 --> 00:59.711
No. That'’s a closet.

00:59.798 --> 01:01.713
Well, I don'’t know
what choice we have.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.715
We certainly can'’t sleep
in the same bed together.

01:03.802 --> 01:06.414
Why not? I'’m tiny.

01:06.501 --> 01:10.722
What happens when one of us
has a gentleman caller?

01:10.809 --> 01:13.377
Well, Blanche Dubois,

01:13.464 --> 01:15.945
one of us can sleep
on the couch then.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.903
I guess that can work.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.644
We will need
some kind of signal.

01:19.731 --> 01:22.299
You mean like a
sock on the door?

01:22.386 --> 01:24.171
Yeah, but classier.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.998
A sock wearing a top hat?

01:29.959 --> 01:32.048
How about this beer cozy?

01:32.135 --> 01:33.919
Yeah, I guess that'’ll work.

01:34.006 --> 01:36.574
Yeah. It'’s like it'’s having sex
with the doorknob.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.295
Morning.Morning.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.166
What you doing?

02:03.253 --> 02:04.689
I'’m trying to figure
out how to fix

02:04.776 --> 02:06.517
a coin-operated washing
machine on YouTube.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.389
Any luck?

02:08.476 --> 02:09.868
No, but look.

02:09.955 --> 02:13.263
A monkey playing
harmonica.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.222
[harmonica playing]

02:19.922 --> 02:21.358
Holy mackerel!

02:21.445 --> 02:22.794
He'’s actually
playing the blues.

02:22.881 --> 02:25.536
Yeah, he'’s obviously
known sadness.

02:25.623 --> 02:26.537
[doorbell rings]

02:26.624 --> 02:27.886
I'’ll get it.

02:27.973 --> 02:29.845
Who hurt you, little monkey?

02:32.456 --> 02:33.631
Roscoe, your dad'’s here!

02:33.718 --> 02:35.590
Get a move on!

02:36.939 --> 02:39.855
Hey! Nice place.

02:39.942 --> 02:40.899
Thanks.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.379
Look at you all cleaned up.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.164
Court date?

02:44.251 --> 02:45.730
There'’s no court on Saturday.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.863
You know that.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.734
Come on in.

02:49.821 --> 02:53.216
So... what'’s with the...

02:53.303 --> 02:56.263
new haircut and
big boy clothes?

02:56.350 --> 03:00.005
Well, uh, Candace
bought me this stuff.

03:00.092 --> 03:01.224
Very nice.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.922
What'’s a "Candace"?

03:04.009 --> 03:06.751
She'’s a girl I'’m living with.

03:06.838 --> 03:08.013
You'’re living with somebody?

03:08.100 --> 03:10.102
Why didn'’t you tell me?

03:10.190 --> 03:11.800
Well, you were
kind of homeless for a while,

03:11.887 --> 03:14.672
and I didn'’t want you to think
I was showing off.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.761
That'’s amazing.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.372
Good for you.

03:18.459 --> 03:19.851
Gets better!
She got me this sweet gig

03:19.938 --> 03:21.723
selling cars
at her dad'’s dealership.

03:21.810 --> 03:24.813
Hang on.
You have a legitimate job?

03:24.900 --> 03:27.511
Yeah, the cars are easy to sell,
too, '’cause they'’re from Korea,

03:27.598 --> 03:31.254
which I'’m sure you know
is the new Japan.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.735
What about your pot business?

03:33.822 --> 03:35.476
Ah, well...

03:35.563 --> 03:38.609
Candace decided I didn'’t want
to do that anymore.

03:38.696 --> 03:40.524
But it'’s cool

03:40.611 --> 03:42.265
'’cause I love selling cars.

03:42.352 --> 03:43.745
They'’re even talking
about sending me to Seoul

03:43.832 --> 03:45.616
for a management program.

03:45.703 --> 03:46.922
Seoul?
Yeah.

03:47.009 --> 03:49.751
I think it'’s in Korea.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.405
Oh, check this out.

03:51.492 --> 03:54.538
Kimchi.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.279
What'’s it mean?

03:56.366 --> 03:57.672
"Pickled cabbage."
I'’m told it comes up

03:57.759 --> 03:59.021
more often than you'’d think.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.631
Yeah.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.981
Hey, Dad!
Want to see my new room?

04:03.068 --> 04:05.462
No, no. You can show him later.

04:05.549 --> 04:07.551
You guys get
out of here.

04:07.638 --> 04:08.857
Go have fun.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.075
Okay.

04:10.162 --> 04:12.687
Baxter, wait.

04:12.774 --> 04:15.690
This woman, Candace, if she'’s
gonna be around Roscoe,

04:15.777 --> 04:17.779
I think I should meet her.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.563
Of course.
I'’ll set it up.

04:19.649 --> 04:21.522
In the meantime,

04:21.608 --> 04:25.395
this is a brochure
for our new hatchback.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.832
It'’s perfect for
hauling kids,

04:27.919 --> 04:30.400
hauling groceries
and hauling ass.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.359
Thanks.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.926
But my ass can'’t afford it.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.667
Come on, zero down.

04:36.754 --> 04:39.017
No payments
for 12 months.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.803
Kind of like you
and child support.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.805
Okay, bye!

04:47.765 --> 04:49.027
What happened to him?

04:49.114 --> 04:51.508
Apparently, he has
a new girlfriend,

04:51.595 --> 04:53.641
a new home and a new job.

04:53.728 --> 04:54.685
Fantastic.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.165
Yeah, I'’m happy for him.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.166
You don'’t sound happy.

04:57.253 --> 04:59.168
Well, I am!

05:01.213 --> 05:03.781
Tell me again how you finagled
your way into this job.

05:03.868 --> 05:07.045
There was no finagling.
Just a straight-out lie.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.221
So, you told them
you were a handyman?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.223
Told them I was
an aircraft mechanic.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.356
This was a step down
for First Lieutenant Plunkett.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.621
Do you remember when we were
broke and you conned your way

05:17.708 --> 05:19.580
into teaching
at that Catholic high school?

05:19.667 --> 05:21.712
Oh, yeah. All I needed was
a Halloween costume

05:21.799 --> 05:24.324
and a willingness
to hit kids with a ruler.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.805
So what'’s the plan?

05:27.892 --> 05:29.372
You'’re gonna call me
every time something breaks?

05:29.459 --> 05:31.026
Pretty much.

05:31.113 --> 05:32.723
Hand me the Phillips.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.553
And what do I get
out of this deal?

05:36.640 --> 05:38.512
You get to help
your daughter and grandchildren

05:38.599 --> 05:40.165
keep a roof over their heads.

05:40.252 --> 05:43.212
Yeah, what else you got?

05:43.299 --> 05:45.736
What'’d you have in mind?

05:45.823 --> 05:47.129
Don'’t play coy.

05:47.216 --> 05:50.437
I know you'’re staring
at my ass crack.

05:50.524 --> 05:53.222
That'’s '’cause it'’s a lot hairier
than I remember it being.

05:54.832 --> 05:57.531
Turn on the machine.
Let'’s see what we got.

05:59.663 --> 06:02.274
Hey! You fixed it.
Yeah.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.669
These hands are good at making
old things come to life.

06:05.756 --> 06:08.280
You want to try that again?

06:09.673 --> 06:11.109
Very much so.

06:12.241 --> 06:13.416
You look beautiful.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.375
Better.Mm.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.379
Hold on.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.210
Better.

06:30.781 --> 06:33.262
Nice.

06:33.349 --> 06:34.306
Sorry.Sorry.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.960
No, no. Keep going.

06:36.047 --> 06:39.747
I'’m an old man with no cable TV.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.270
That'’s okay.

06:41.357 --> 06:42.184
You the new super?

06:42.271 --> 06:44.099
Actually, I am.

06:44.186 --> 06:45.274
Really?

06:45.361 --> 06:48.451
You'’re very attractive.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.105
Thank you.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.063
You see, that'’s how you make
a lady feel special.

06:54.065 --> 06:57.329
So, is this a serious
thing between you two?

06:57.417 --> 06:58.287
Well, we'’re working on it...

06:58.374 --> 07:00.202
I'’m not talking to you.

07:01.812 --> 07:05.033
I'’m talking to Legs.

07:07.644 --> 07:08.732
I'’ll see you around.

07:08.819 --> 07:11.605
Oh, uh,
Jack Bumgartner, 1F.

07:11.692 --> 07:14.608
You have the key.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.610
Hey, I'’m right here.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.350
For now.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.443
Enjoy your meal.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.838
Good evening.
Welcome to the...

07:27.925 --> 07:29.449
Aw, hell no!

07:31.712 --> 07:33.627
You said you wanted to
meet my new girlfriend.

07:33.714 --> 07:34.976
Ta-da.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.760
Christy, Candace.
Candace, Christy.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.066
Is this awkward?

07:38.153 --> 07:39.589
Because we could
move to another table.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.025
No, no, no. This is fine.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.331
Nice to meet you.

07:42.418 --> 07:43.985
Aw, same here.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.639
You know, Baxter'’s told me

07:45.726 --> 07:47.902
all about how you'’ve turned
your life around.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.382
Good for you.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.560
I think you guys are
gonna be best friends.

07:53.647 --> 07:56.171
We'’re certainly off
to a great start.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.521
Hey, how'’s it going?

07:58.608 --> 08:00.349
Candace bought me new clothes.

08:00.436 --> 08:02.177
Yeah, I noticed.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.613
No one'’s owned them before.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.703
I'’m the first person
to wear them.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.010
Don'’t get used to it.

08:09.097 --> 08:11.229
So, Christy,

08:11.316 --> 08:13.362
I hear you just moved
into a new apartment.

08:13.449 --> 08:15.538
Yeah, we'’re really
excited about it.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.932
I live in the closet.

08:20.543 --> 08:23.198
Why don'’t we get you some bread?

08:23.285 --> 08:24.808
MAN:
Excuse me, miss?

08:24.895 --> 08:26.984
Not now!

08:27.071 --> 08:30.074
Yeah, baby.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.381
Spank that tushy.

08:32.467 --> 08:33.817
[smacking]

08:33.904 --> 08:36.472
Ooh.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.256
[knocking]

08:38.342 --> 08:40.258
Damn.

08:45.089 --> 08:47.396
What?Sorry to bother you, I just...

08:47.483 --> 08:48.745
I needed to talk to somebody.

08:48.832 --> 08:49.964
Come on.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.269
Thanks.

08:51.356 --> 08:53.881
So, I was just
with my ex and...

08:53.968 --> 08:56.884
Oh, whoa, what the hell
are you watching?

08:56.971 --> 08:58.799
Man-on-man porn.

08:58.886 --> 09:01.845
So, what about your ex?

09:03.064 --> 09:04.456
[stammers]

09:04.544 --> 09:06.067
He-he was helping me
fix a washing machine,

09:06.154 --> 09:07.938
and we started making out and...

09:08.025 --> 09:10.550
I'’m sorry.
This does it for you?

09:10.637 --> 09:12.552
I like the sausage party.

09:15.163 --> 09:16.860
Go on.

09:16.947 --> 09:17.861
Um...

09:19.559 --> 09:22.387
Okay. Uh, so we hadn'’t
seen each other

09:22.474 --> 09:24.955
in-in a few years, and
after his heart attack,

09:25.042 --> 09:26.566
we kind of reconciled and...

09:26.653 --> 09:29.133
uh, old feelings
started up and...

09:29.220 --> 09:30.613
Can you just
turn this off?

09:30.700 --> 09:33.137
There'’s too many balls.

09:33.224 --> 09:36.053
That'’s actually
the name of this one.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.971
Anyway, uh,
long story short,

09:41.058 --> 09:43.104
we almost had sex
this afternoon.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.193
It didn'’t happen, but
he'’s coming over later,

09:45.280 --> 09:49.066
and we both know why, and
it'’s kind of messing me up.

09:49.153 --> 09:51.634
Oh, you still have
feelings for him.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.070
Of course I do.

09:53.157 --> 09:54.202
I don'’t know.
It'’s complicated.

09:54.289 --> 09:55.246
Where are the cats?

09:55.333 --> 09:56.596
I put them in the bedroom.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.902
I don'’t like them to see
this side of me.

10:01.078 --> 10:03.646
I'’m not crazy about
seeing it, either.

10:03.733 --> 10:06.475
Okay, look, do you want
a relationship with this man?

10:06.562 --> 10:07.607
Yeah.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.173
I-I guess. I-I...

10:09.260 --> 10:11.175
I'’m just afraid of
getting hurt again.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.700
Well, that'’s understandable.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.745
So, have you considered
not having sex with him

10:15.832 --> 10:17.486
until you see
where this is going?

10:17.573 --> 10:19.357
Is that a real thing?

10:19.444 --> 10:22.622
Yes, it'’s a real thing.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.189
Hmm. It doesn'’t
sound right.

10:25.276 --> 10:28.236
Bonnie, your whole life--
you met a guy,

10:28.323 --> 10:30.281
you like the guy,
you sleep with the guy.

10:30.368 --> 10:32.544
I didn'’t always
like them.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.070
Okay, a good definition of
insanity is doing the same thing

10:36.157 --> 10:38.725
over and over again, and
expecting a different result.

10:38.812 --> 10:41.205
But what if I do the same
thing just one more time?

10:41.292 --> 10:42.729
You know, just in
case it'’s different.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.732
Okay, fine.

10:45.819 --> 10:49.344
So, what do I do with
the, you know, urges?

10:53.870 --> 10:56.351
[sexy music playing]

11:07.841 --> 11:09.190
Sorry.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.757
I thought maybe
you bailed on me.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.628
No, I just had
to visit a sick friend.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.325
Oh, no. What'’s wrong with her?

11:14.412 --> 11:16.197
Well, she has cancer, but
that'’s not really the problem.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.462
Come on in.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.118
Everybody is
out and about?

11:24.205 --> 11:25.641
Yep.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.775
Just you and me.
Great.

11:28.862 --> 11:32.517
Oh, got us some
non-alcoholic sparkling cider,

11:32.604 --> 11:35.869
in case we want to,
I don'’t know, get bloated.

11:38.610 --> 11:41.265
Oh. Why don'’t we
open this later.

11:41.352 --> 11:43.311
Yeah.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.095
So...

11:45.182 --> 11:47.097
So...

11:48.490 --> 11:50.666
Here we are.

11:50.753 --> 11:53.408
Yes.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.023
I'’m a little nervous.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.372
Me, too.

12:03.853 --> 12:07.639
It'’s weird, '’cause it'’s not
like any part of me'’s a virgin.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.777
Friend of mine thinks

12:14.864 --> 12:16.518
I shouldn'’t hop in
the sack with you.

12:16.605 --> 12:17.780
What do you think?

12:17.867 --> 12:19.216
I think I should
get a new friend.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.393
Oh, no.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.352
Wash him, he'’s dirty.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.834
[knocking]

12:31.011 --> 12:33.840
I slip in the shower,
no one comes over.

12:36.146 --> 12:37.582
What?

12:37.669 --> 12:40.281
Sorry. I know it'’s late.

12:40.368 --> 12:43.371
I just had a really rough night,
and I needed to talk to you.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.676
Come on in.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.722
You will not believe it.

12:46.809 --> 12:49.899
But my ex brings Roscoe
and his new girlfriend

12:49.986 --> 12:53.207
over to the restaurant,
and I have to serve...

12:53.294 --> 12:55.992
Holy crap.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.429
Look at the size
of that thing.

12:58.516 --> 13:01.432
Yeah. Yeah, that'’s big.

13:01.519 --> 13:04.087
So, your ex comes
into the restaurant, and...?

13:04.174 --> 13:07.482
And he'’s dating
this Candace woman,

13:07.569 --> 13:09.266
who'’s got a lot of money.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.399
She'’s cleaned him up,
got him a good job.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.270
So, what'’s the problem?

13:13.357 --> 13:15.969
I am trying so hard.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.580
I quit drinking,
I'’m going to meetings.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.974
Where'’s my Candace?!

13:21.061 --> 13:23.715
You want a woman with money
to take care of you?

13:25.500 --> 13:27.415
No.

13:27.502 --> 13:31.201
I mean... I'’m flexible.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.377
You want my advice?

13:33.464 --> 13:34.988
Get over it.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.772
If he'’s doing better,
it'’s good for your son,

13:36.859 --> 13:38.948
it'’s good for you,
it'’s good for everybody.

13:39.035 --> 13:41.385
Wait, but you haven'’t even
heard the worst of it.

13:41.472 --> 13:43.083
When they left the restaurant,

13:43.170 --> 13:47.609
his girlfriend hugs me
and leaves me a huge tip.

13:47.696 --> 13:48.958
That cow.

13:49.045 --> 13:50.786
Right?

13:50.873 --> 13:53.833
Listen, I told you
what to do--

13:53.920 --> 13:56.879
you do it, don'’t do it,
just get out.

13:56.966 --> 13:58.620
Thanks for listening.

13:58.707 --> 14:01.623
Mm-hmm.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.146
Where are the cats?

14:03.233 --> 14:04.756
They died. Now, get out.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.375
I was just thinking--

14:14.462 --> 14:16.768
the last time we were
together like this,

14:16.856 --> 14:19.423
I had an afro
and mutton-chop sideburns.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.730
And yet I still
slept with you.

14:21.817 --> 14:22.862
[chuckles]

14:24.994 --> 14:26.343
I missed this.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.215
Me, too.

14:30.043 --> 14:34.090
35 years go by,
and it'’s like nothing'’s changed.

14:36.223 --> 14:37.441
What'’s that
supposed to mean?

14:37.528 --> 14:39.182
I don'’t know.

14:39.269 --> 14:42.316
It means... I'’m glad
we'’re still the same people.

14:43.752 --> 14:45.885
Hang on.

14:45.972 --> 14:48.322
I am capable of
changing, you know.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.672
Yeah, sure.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.543
It'’s not like I'’m doomed to
make the same stupid mistakes

14:52.630 --> 14:53.936
over and over again.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.111
Nobody'’s saying that.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.070
Let'’s keep kissing.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.684
Hey, give me a second.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.555
What'’s going on?

15:04.642 --> 15:06.514
I don'’t know.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.130
Alvin...

15:14.217 --> 15:16.350
I-I'’m sorry, I
can'’t do this.

15:16.437 --> 15:17.742
Why? What'’s wrong?

15:17.829 --> 15:20.832
I want a real
relationship.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.182
So do I.

15:22.269 --> 15:25.054
Well, if that'’s ever
gonna happen for us,

15:25.141 --> 15:27.665
we need to get to know
each other again.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.145
Take it slow.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.408
I'’m 56 years old;

15:31.495 --> 15:34.324
it was gonna be slow
no matter what we did.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.068
Be serious.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.549
Of course we can
take it slow.

15:41.636 --> 15:42.724
Thank you.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.030
No problem.

15:44.117 --> 15:45.205
So, now what?

15:45.292 --> 15:46.554
Well, I don'’t know.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.643
I'’ve never not
done this before.

15:48.730 --> 15:52.299
Uh, can we still...

15:52.386 --> 15:54.214
make out and stuff?

15:54.301 --> 15:56.085
Oh, yeah, I-I know what
you'’re really asking,

15:56.172 --> 15:57.957
and the answer is no.

16:01.569 --> 16:05.399
No, Baxter, he cannot spend
the night with you and Candace.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.444
I don'’t need a reason,
I'’m his mother.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.751
Bring him home now.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.796
[sighs]

16:11.883 --> 16:13.755
Look at me being a bitch.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.630
Ew.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.765
Ew!

16:23.852 --> 16:26.115
Nothing happened.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.465
Dad, I'’m a
grown woman.

16:28.552 --> 16:31.599
I know a sex beer
cozy when I see one.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.079
Yeah, you'’d think.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.602
But, honestly, nothing happened.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.604
Your mother is a classy broad.

16:36.691 --> 16:39.476
Since when?

16:39.563 --> 16:41.348
About an hour ago.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.007
Is he gone?

16:49.834 --> 16:51.271
Yeah.

16:51.358 --> 16:52.576
What happened?

16:52.663 --> 16:54.317
Nothing.

16:54.404 --> 16:55.971
I took Marjorie'’s advice,
did things differently,

16:56.058 --> 16:57.494
and I feel terrific.

16:57.581 --> 17:00.367
You know she watches gay porn?

17:02.151 --> 17:03.544
I know, I watched it with her.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.023
I think she'’s onto something.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.157
Yeah. Well, I'’m happy
she helped you,

17:09.244 --> 17:10.768
but she was of no use to me.

17:10.855 --> 17:13.292
What did she tell you?

17:13.380 --> 17:15.469
I don'’t even want
to repeat it.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.210
It'’s just that ridiculous.

17:17.297 --> 17:18.559
Try me.

17:18.646 --> 17:22.214
She thinks I should be
more supportive

17:22.301 --> 17:24.304
of my ex-husband.

17:24.391 --> 17:25.914
That'’s crazy.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.523
Thank you.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.004
You'’re not capable
of being supportive.

17:29.091 --> 17:32.703
You'’re a petty and
vindictive woman.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.054
I am not petty and vindictive.

17:36.707 --> 17:39.275
I... just can'’t stand it
when good things happen

17:39.362 --> 17:41.234
to people I used to love.

17:41.321 --> 17:44.150
You know the definition
of insanity?

17:44.237 --> 17:45.760
Yes, I know the definition
of insanity!

17:45.847 --> 17:48.110
I live with you!

17:48.197 --> 17:51.157
Christy, eventually you'’re
gonna do the right thing.

17:53.333 --> 17:56.771
I disagree.

17:56.858 --> 17:59.556
I choose the dark side.

17:59.643 --> 18:00.731
Come here.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.474
It'’s not fair.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.215
I know.

18:06.302 --> 18:08.696
I spent all those years
trying to mold that pot-addled

18:08.783 --> 18:12.656
lump of clay,
and now Candace gets the reward.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.354
Sweetie, look at me.

18:14.441 --> 18:18.097
Lest we forget, the
reward is Baxter.

18:21.665 --> 18:25.495
Mom, if you love me,
let me hate.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.810
Nice.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.601
Nice place.Candace has a pool.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.603
Oh, don'’t you pee in it.

18:46.690 --> 18:49.215
Unless you have to.

18:49.302 --> 18:50.825
[doorbell rings]

18:52.827 --> 18:53.784
Hey, guys.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.264
Hi, Candace.

18:55.351 --> 18:56.787
I'’m so glad you changed
your mind

18:56.874 --> 18:58.311
about Roscoe
spending time with us.

18:58.398 --> 19:01.314
Yeah, well, it works out
for everybody.

19:01.401 --> 19:05.100
He gets to be with his dad,
and I get a little me time.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.406
Hey, you made it.

19:06.493 --> 19:07.972
Can we go swimming?

19:08.059 --> 19:09.931
The pool is heated,
and the spa'’s all toasty.

19:10.018 --> 19:13.152
Go put your suit on.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.328
Okay, sweetie, love you!

19:15.415 --> 19:17.156
Bye!

19:17.243 --> 19:18.679
Ah, he waved.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.898
You didn'’t see it.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.900
[clears throat]

19:22.987 --> 19:24.075
Okay, see you later.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.076
Bye.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.426
Wait.

19:26.513 --> 19:29.385
I need to apologize
to you guys.

19:29.472 --> 19:32.693
I shouldn'’t have kept
Roscoe from staying here.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.651
You seem very nice.

19:34.738 --> 19:36.392
And, um...

19:36.479 --> 19:38.133
I'’m happy you
found each other.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.874
Well, credit where it'’s due.

19:39.961 --> 19:42.311
None of this happens
if you hadn'’t thrown me away.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.706
You know what they say.

19:45.793 --> 19:49.362
One person'’s trash
is another person'’s...

19:49.449 --> 19:51.320
car salesman.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.932
Don'’t worry.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.239
I'’m gonna take great care
of your son while he'’s with us.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.067
I know. Thanks.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.547
Candace fixed up the guest room.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.418
He'’s got his own TV,
video games...

20:02.505 --> 20:06.596
Ooh, anda closet
that he can use as a closet.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.687
That'’s a good one.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.082
Okay.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.911
I'’ll, uh... see you
in a couple days.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.565
Okay, bye.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.224
"Closet he can use as a closet"!

20:41.065 --> 20:43.285
[doorbell rings]

20:43.372 --> 20:44.591
Yeah.

20:44.678 --> 20:48.595
I think I owe you
another apology.
