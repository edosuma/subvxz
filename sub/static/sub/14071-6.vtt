but I'm not single yet.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.249
Oh, really? You're gonna try
to make it work out long distance?

01:26.336 --> 01:28.668
I mean, assuming that Tracy gets the job.

01:29.006 --> 01:32.089
Don't let my past cloud yourjudgment
about me. I'm a different man.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.461
My friend, you haven't had
a monogamous relationship

01:34.553 --> 01:36.919

in your entire life.

who knows if Travis Mack can even run?

02:31.068 --> 02:33.605
Right now I’ve got him going second round
on my big board.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.145

that he’s not a total head case,

02:36.406 --> 02:37.987
he could fall even further.

02:38.075 --> 02:41.613
Only begs the question, who the hell
is representing this train wreck?

Oh, you know Mark?

02:56.760 --> 02:58.671
Yeah, we burned some time
trolling for marlin.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.553
Is that code for something?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.097
No, he'sjust, straight up, my fishing buddy.

Must be nice not having to worry
about staying in shape.

We're not here to make friends.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.635
Yeah, but you cut me to keep him.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.057
You said go smaller.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.310
We signed a nice athletic
Pro Bowl tackle from KC.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.981
Kovac gotta go.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.199
No, sir. I can handle it.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.278
Good. Drop a dime and drop the bomb.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.830
You know, I should probably do it in person.
It's just more respectful.

I don't care if you do it
from a hot-air balloon, Charles.

Is this for business or pleasure?

SPENCER: A little bit of both.
JASON: It's covert business.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.640
It's the art of doing business
without doing any business at all.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.939
All right, well,
who are we not doing business with?

05:18.068 --> 05:19.524

Hey, what we're hoping for today,
and obviously it's a big-ass hope,

05:25.534 --> 05:28.651
is that he gets a little face time with you
and he changes his opinion.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.493
We're gonna need that. It'll raise your stock.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.201
I belong in the top five, Spence.
You and you told me that.

05:33.291 --> 05:36.283
And we're gonna get you in the top five.
Right now, we win Mark over,

05:36.503 --> 05:39.791

So we got a job to do.

I'd have preferred to hear it from you,
big man.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.995
I'm sorry I hadn't had the guts
to tell you earlier, all right?

20:50.207 --> 20:51.822
But your sting will pass.

20:51.917 --> 20:55.705
You're young and you're gonna land
somewhere that really needs you

20:55.838 --> 20:58.625
and you're gonna play in this league
for a long-ass time.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.332
You gotta trust me. I've been around
long enough to know.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.047
But you gotta believe it.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.677
In your heart.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.673
I'm trying, man.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.595
For my family.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.687
Well, then you got to be strong for them.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.356
Right?

21:17.902 --> 21:19.642
Man, you're Nick Kovac.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.519
They can't tell you shit.

21:21.906 --> 21:24.192
Right? Fuck Siefert.

21:26.035 --> 21:27.320
Thanks, man.

21:28.162 --> 21:29.527
How you know I needed that?

21:30.289 --> 21:31.699
I didn't.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.156
Shit, that was for me.

21:34.376 --> 21:35.502
(CHUCKLES)

21:38.380 --> 21:39.916
He gonna run today or what?

21:42.551 --> 21:43.927
-You got this?
-(EXHALES)

21:44.762 --> 21:46.002
Yeah, I got it.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.180
What the fuck?

21:50.559 --> 21:51.719
It calms my nerves, man.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.223
Listen to me. You got this.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.434
You really think so?

21:58.067 --> 21:59.557
Yes, I do.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.229
(SIGHS)

22:06.826 --> 22:09.067
Dennis! This fucking... Dennis!

22:09.203 --> 22:11.740
Dennis! Where the fuck you at?

22:12.248 --> 22:14.409
DENNIS: What make it so difficult
for you to call me Dad?

22:14.583 --> 22:16.619
Have you lost your simple-ass mind?

22:16.710 --> 22:18.701
'Cause of you, New Orleans pulled their offer.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.787
New Orleans? Fuck New Orleans, man.

22:20.965 --> 22:23.752
Hey, look, Buffalo is where the money is.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.004
Oh, what, Buffalo got you on payroll now?

22:26.095 --> 22:29.508
Oh, come on, Ricky. It's only your interests
that I got at heart.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.384
Oh, now you want to be
a hands-on parent, right?

22:31.475 --> 22:33.261
It's better late than never, man. Come on.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.513
I'm 30 years old. School is out. You missed it.

22:35.604 --> 22:38.767
Maybe I missed it, but maybe
it's that little piece of ass Bella

22:38.858 --> 22:40.689
that makes you not want to leave.

22:42.069 --> 22:45.607
-Disrespect her, motherfucker...
-Get your hands off me.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.116
Fuck that!

22:49.451 --> 22:51.703
DENNIS: You little mother... God damn it.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.580
Time you pay your daddy
some motherfucking respect.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.325
Is this for real
or are you niggas play-fighting?

22:55.416 --> 22:56.747

Fuck, Andre. Hey.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.061
-I was looking for the bathroom.
-Mmm.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.392
That's not it.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.099
I hope you didn't soil my rug.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.266
(LAUGHS)

24:06.362 --> 24:09.354
No, no.
I'm totally housebroken.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.029
But you probably knew that, right?

24:11.116 --> 24:12.856
-Well, I wasn't sure.
-Well, I am.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.574
So, case closed.

Hey, urn, (CLEARS THROAT)
while you're here,

24:19.208 --> 24:20.869
I've been thinking about your offer

24:21.001 --> 24:24.789
and I'm gonna have to respectfully decline.

24:25.881 --> 24:29.794
It's very generous and thank you.
It really is, but, uh,

24:31.053 --> 24:33.669
sadly, I'm more loyal than I am ambitious.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.129
Well, I am sorry to hear you say that.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.471
Well, there's a first time for everything, right?

24:39.561 --> 24:42.974
-Mmm-hmm.
-Well... But great party.

24:43.273 --> 24:47.482
The food, Anna, drinks, really, really fun day.

24:47.569 --> 24:48.900
Thank you.

24:49.071 --> 24:51.562
Uh, there's something I forgot to mention.

24:51.657 --> 24:55.696
Your partner lost
quite a bit of money a while back.

24:56.370 --> 24:59.237
The kind of money that would raise
even the wealthiest of eyebrows,

24:59.331 --> 25:00.741
not to mention clients.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.326
Yeah, I don't know anything about it.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.784
I know you don't, but the NFLPA does.

25:04.878 --> 25:08.211
Which makes me wonder,
if Spencer doesn't trust you enough

25:08.298 --> 25:10.209
to tell you the truth about his past,

25:10.926 --> 25:12.917
how could you possibly
trust him with your future?

25:15.931 --> 25:18.172
-Boy, something to think about, huh?
-Mmm-hmm.

25:18.267 --> 25:19.507
-For the drive home.
-Yeah.

25:19.601 --> 25:22.092
Great. Thank you. Gotta go.

to use the bathroom first.

Are you kidding me?

25:57.723 --> 25:59.884
-Are you kidding me?
-I guess I owe you some money.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.057
No, keep it. That'll make this business.

26:05.856 --> 26:06.891
Whoo!

26:06.982 --> 26:08.563
-Holy shit.
-Whoo!

26:08.692 --> 26:10.774
Hey, the kid may have small hands
and short arms,

26:11.070 --> 26:14.562
but one thing we now know he can do,
this boy can run.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.147
He's even quicker chasing the ball.
Believe me.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.324
Listen, when I'm wrong, I own it.
