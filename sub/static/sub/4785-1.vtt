03:26.415 --> 03:30.002
You want to be Atticus Finch. Good!

03:31.962 --> 03:33.422
- I like him.
- Why?

03:33.630 --> 03:35.299
- He's honest.
- Yes.

03:35.507 --> 03:38.260
- He stands up for the right thing.
- Yes.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.304
- And he's a good father.
- He is.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.806
- Did it all by himself.
- Did what all by himself?

03:43.015 --> 03:45.267
- Raised his kids.
- He didn't!

03:45.851 --> 03:48.437
Who was the woman
that came every day?

03:48.645 --> 03:51.148
- Calpurnia.
- Calpurnia. He remembered.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.192
- What about Boo?
- What?

03:53.400 --> 03:56.987
Boo's the most interesting character
in <i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

03:57.279 --> 03:59.114
Excuse me.

03:59.656 --> 04:03.368
I'm a teacher. "Xmas" isn't
in the English language.

04:03.577 --> 04:07.039
It's either "Merry Christmas"...

04:07.247 --> 04:09.875
...or "Happy Holidays."

04:11.043 --> 04:12.127
Thank you.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.795
Sure.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.761
Tell me about Livia.

04:20.969 --> 04:25.057
She killed everyone so her son
could be king. Like Nixon.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.021
Please, please, please.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.650
- Anita?
- Hey, Mom.

04:35.025 --> 04:39.196
- Want something to eat?
- No, thanks. I already ate.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.783
- Are you sure? I made soy cutlets.
- I'm fine.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.285
Wait. You've been kissing.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.038
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.958
- I can tell.
- You can't tell.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.962
Not only can I tell,
I know who it is. It's Darryl.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.051
What you got under your coat?

05:04.680 --> 05:09.560
- Why can't we listen to our music?
- It's about drugs and promiscuous sex.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.603
Simon and Garfunkel is poetry.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.398
The poetry of drugs
and promiscuous sex.

05:14.648 --> 05:18.026
Honey, they're on pot.

05:20.404 --> 05:24.116
First, it was butter.
Then sugar and white flour.

05:24.324 --> 05:28.412
Bacon, eggs, bologna,
rock'n'roll, motorcycles.

05:28.620 --> 05:32.207
Then, it was celebrating
Christmas in September...

05:32.416 --> 05:35.085
...when it wouldn't
be commercialized.

05:35.544 --> 05:39.256
- What else will you ban?
- You wanna rebel against knowledge.

05:39.464 --> 05:44.511
- I give you the Cliffs Notes on life.
- We're like nobody else I know!

05:44.803 --> 05:49.266
I'm a college professor. Why can't
I teach my own kids? Use me.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.769
Darryl says you use knowledge
to keep me down.

05:52.978 --> 05:58.150
He says I'm a "yes" person and you
are raising us in a "no" environment.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.111
Clearly, Darryl
doesn't hear "no" much.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.614
I can't live here! I hate you!

06:03.822 --> 06:05.824
- William hates you.
- I don't.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.243
You don't even know the truth.

06:08.452 --> 06:11.747
- Don't be a drama queen.
- Feck you!

06:12.873 --> 06:14.750
This is a house of lies!

06:15.626 --> 06:17.336
There it is.

06:17.628 --> 06:21.673
- Your sister used the "F" word.
- I think she said "feck."

06:22.341 --> 06:25.302
- What's the difference?
- The letter "U."

07:00.212 --> 07:03.257
Are you really in our grade?

07:04.591 --> 07:09.346
Hey, guys! Check it out.
William doesn't have any pubes.

07:09.805 --> 07:12.724
- How old are you, man?
- He's not a man.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.602
- He's a baby.
- Bet he doesn't get zits.

07:15.811 --> 07:18.272
Everyone has hair.
What's wrong?

07:18.480 --> 07:21.942
- How old are you, like 2?
- How pathetic!

07:22.234 --> 07:24.736
Where are your pubes?

07:25.529 --> 07:27.447
I had them.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.867
I shaved them off.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.041
He's a funny guy.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.377
See you, pubes.

07:48.594 --> 07:51.221
- Hey, noodle.
- Hi, guys.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.432
Put on your seat belt.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.936
We got our annuals.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.148
- Received your annual.
- Right, received.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.364
I look so much younger
than everyone.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.825
Enjoy it while you can.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.703
Mom, it's time.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.249
- Can this wait till we get home?
- Pull over.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.920
Tell him the truth.
Tell him how old he is.

08:29.593 --> 08:31.220
He knows how old he is.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.765
Kids make fun of him
because he looks young.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.393
Nobody includes him.
They call him "The Narc."

08:38.602 --> 08:40.312
- They do?
- What's a narc?

08:40.520 --> 08:44.942
- A narcotics officer.
- What's wrong with that?

08:45.734 --> 08:48.487
Come on, you guys.
It's no big deal.

08:48.737 --> 08:51.365
I'm 12.
She skipped me a grade.

08:51.865 --> 08:55.661
Big deal. I'm a year younger.
They're 13, I'm 12.

08:58.914 --> 08:59.957
Aren't I?

09:00.165 --> 09:04.211
I put you in first grade when
you were 5 and didn't tell you.

09:04.586 --> 09:08.382
- So I'm how old?
- This will scar him forever.

09:08.590 --> 09:11.802
Don't be Cleopatra.
We have to be Mom and Dad.

09:12.010 --> 09:16.515
You put too much pressure on him.
When he rebels in some odd way...

09:16.723 --> 09:18.600
...don't blame me.
- How old am I?

09:18.809 --> 09:20.602
You skipped an extra grade.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.563
You're 11.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.067
Eleven?

09:27.776 --> 09:30.070
So you skipped fifth grade.

09:30.279 --> 09:34.199
- They pad the grades too much.
- Eleven?!

09:35.409 --> 09:39.872
You also skipped kindergarten.
I taught it to you when you were 4.

09:43.167 --> 09:46.879
This explains so much.

09:47.671 --> 09:53.093
- You've robbed him of an adolescence.
- Adolescence is a marketing tool.

09:53.719 --> 09:56.638
Honey, I know you were
expecting puberty...

09:56.889 --> 09:59.600
...but you'll have to
shine it on for a while.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.519
Who needs a crowd?

10:02.769 --> 10:06.231
Who put such a high premium
on being typical?

10:06.481 --> 10:07.691
You're unique.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.776
You're two years ahead.

10:09.985 --> 10:13.030
Take those extra years
and do what you want.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.908
Go to Europe. Take a look around.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.951
See what you like.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.746
Follow your dream.

10:21.079 --> 10:25.167
You'll still be the youngest lawyer.
Your dad was proud.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.879
He knew you were a predominately
accelerated child.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.298
What about me?

10:33.175 --> 10:36.803
You are rebellious
and ungrateful of my love.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.145
Somebody's gotta be normal
around here.

10:46.813 --> 10:47.856
11.

10:50.025 --> 10:53.654
This song explains why I'm leaving
home to become a stewardess.

10:53.862 --> 10:57.074
We can't talk?
We have to listen to rock music?

10:57.282 --> 10:58.867
I love you.

11:31.817 --> 11:35.612
Man, take good care
of her in San Francisco, man.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.499
One day...

11:47.708 --> 11:49.084
...you'll be cool.

11:52.921 --> 11:57.050
Look under your bed.
It'll set you free.

12:02.264 --> 12:03.932
Watch the plant.

12:07.436 --> 12:10.314
You're 18 and I can't stop you.

12:20.032 --> 12:21.450
She'll be back.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.288
Maybe not soon.

14:47.179 --> 14:49.848
<i>Here's a theory</i>
<i>for you to disregard...</i>

14:51.391 --> 14:52.768
<i>... completely.</i>

14:53.227 --> 14:58.732
Music, you know, true music
not just rock'n'roll, chooses you.

14:58.982 --> 15:02.569
It lives in your car, or alone,
on your headphones...

15:02.778 --> 15:07.157
...with vast, scenic bridges
and angelic choirs in your brain.

15:07.366 --> 15:08.700
It's a place apart...

15:10.536 --> 15:12.746
...from the benign lap of America.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.208
Did you know
"The Letter" by The Box Tops...

15:16.416 --> 15:21.088
...was a minute, 58 seconds long?
It means nothing. Nil.

15:21.296 --> 15:24.049
They take two minutes
to accomplish...

15:24.258 --> 15:28.345
...what Jethro Tull takes hours
to not accomplish.

15:28.554 --> 15:32.099
You see, this is fatuous,
pseudo blubber.

15:32.474 --> 15:35.936
You know, which is fine...

15:36.144 --> 15:38.188
...but to foist it off as art...

15:38.397 --> 15:40.941
The Doors? Jim Morrison?

15:41.149 --> 15:43.026
He's a drunk, posing as a poet.

15:43.277 --> 15:45.821
- I like them.
- Give me The Guess Who.

15:46.029 --> 15:51.159
They got the courage to be drunken
buffoons, which makes them poetic.

15:51.577 --> 15:56.790
It's an honour to have the great
rock critic and editor of <i>Creem...</i>

15:56.999 --> 15:59.918
...back home in San Diego,
Lester Bangs.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.796
<i>Live,</i> "American Woman"?

16:03.046 --> 16:07.551
Have you ever...? The most brilliant
piece of gobbledygook ever!

16:08.844 --> 16:11.471
Give me some
"White LightlWhite Heat."

16:11.680 --> 16:13.015
Lggy Pop!

16:13.265 --> 16:18.228
Amen! Put this on.
This isn't on your playlist.

16:18.437 --> 16:21.773
- Isn't it a bit early for that?
- Not for me.

16:21.982 --> 16:26.570
That was Lester Bangs, this is
Alice Wisdom and here is lggy Pop.

16:33.952 --> 16:39.041
So you're the kid sending me those
articles from the school newspaper.

16:40.292 --> 16:43.587
I've done stuff for
a local underground paper.

16:43.795 --> 16:47.674
- What are you, the star of your school?
- They hate me.

16:47.883 --> 16:51.345
You'll meet again
on their journey to the middle.

16:51.553 --> 16:56.475
Your writing is good. Too bad
you missed rock'n'roll. It's over.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.685
- Over?
- It's over.

16:58.977 --> 17:04.148
You got here for the death rattle.
Last gasp. Last grope.

17:04.358 --> 17:07.402
- At least I'm here for that.
- What do you use?

17:07.611 --> 17:10.155
Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.

17:11.156 --> 17:12.574
You like Lou Reed?

17:12.782 --> 17:16.161
Early stuff.
Lately, he's trying to be Bowie.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.329
He should just be himself.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.374
But if Bowie's doing Lou...

17:20.582 --> 17:23.877
...and Lou's doing Bowie,
Lou's still doing Lou.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.338
If you like Lou.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.550
- You take drugs?
- No.

17:29.800 --> 17:30.968
Smart kid.

17:32.636 --> 17:34.513
I used to do speed.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.892
And sometimes a little cough syrup.

17:39.142 --> 17:42.354
I'd stay up all night,
writing and writing.

17:42.563 --> 17:45.148
I mean, like 25 pages of dribble.

17:45.357 --> 17:48.485
You know, about the Faces,
or Coltrane.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.738
Just to fucking write.

17:53.031 --> 17:55.993
All right.
It's been nice to meet you.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.495
Keep sending me your stuff.

17:59.204 --> 18:02.541
I can't spend all day
talking to my many fans.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.334
I understand.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.922
- Goodbye.
- Yeah, goodbye.

18:19.725 --> 18:22.269
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.776
You need a ride?

18:32.487 --> 18:35.199
No, man, I took the bus.

18:36.783 --> 18:40.579
Once you go to L.A., you'll
have friends like crazy.

18:40.787 --> 18:44.458
But they'll be fake friends.
They'll try to corrupt you.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.836
You look honest,
they'll tell you everything.

18:48.045 --> 18:51.882
But you cannot make friends
with the rock stars.

18:53.217 --> 18:57.596
- Is it okay if I...
- lf you're to be a rock journalist...

18:59.640 --> 19:05.062
You don't get much, but you'll get
free records from the record company.

19:09.107 --> 19:13.570
There's just fucking nothing
about you that is controversial.

19:15.197 --> 19:18.492
God, it'll get ugly.
They'll buy you drinks.

19:18.700 --> 19:22.913
You'll meet girls.
They'll fly you places, offer drugs.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.916
It sounds great,
but they aren't friends.

19:26.124 --> 19:30.337
They want snobbish stories
about the rock stars' genius.

19:30.587 --> 19:35.133
They will ruin rock and strangle
everything we love about it.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.719
They're trying to buy respectability...

19:37.928 --> 19:41.807
...for a forum that's gloriously
and righteously dumb.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.518
You're smart enough to know that.

19:44.726 --> 19:49.106
The day it ceases to be dumb
is the day it ceases to be real.

19:49.314 --> 19:52.442
Then it just becomes
an industry of cool.

19:52.651 --> 19:57.155
You're coming along at a very
dangerous time for rock'n'roll.

19:57.364 --> 20:01.660
I mean, the war is over. They won.

20:01.869 --> 20:04.955
And 99% of what passes
for rock these days...

20:05.164 --> 20:08.000
...silence is more compelling.

20:08.500 --> 20:13.839
So I think you should turn around,
go back and be a lawyer or something.

20:18.677 --> 20:21.597
I can tell from your face
that you won't.

20:21.847 --> 20:23.432
I can give you $35.

20:23.640 --> 20:27.186
- Give me 1000 words on Black Sabbath.
- An assignment?

20:27.394 --> 20:29.396
Yeah, yeah.

20:39.615 --> 20:43.827
You have to make your reputation
on being honest...

20:44.369 --> 20:45.787
...and...

20:47.498 --> 20:49.458
...you know, unmerciful.

20:50.626 --> 20:52.044
Honest.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.588
Unmerciful.

20:54.796 --> 20:59.343
If you get into a jam,
you can call me. I stay up late.

21:03.430 --> 21:08.852
Look, a generation of Cinderellas,
and there's no slipper coming.

21:09.228 --> 21:14.191
You wanted to be Abraham Lincoln.
You wanted to be Atticus Finch.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.152
You want to get high?

21:18.111 --> 21:19.738
I just have to listen.

21:19.947 --> 21:23.992
- That's what Lester said.
- As long as this is just a hobby.

21:24.618 --> 21:27.704
I'll pick you up right here
at 11:00 sharp.

21:27.913 --> 21:30.791
If you get lost,
use the family whistle.

21:31.792 --> 21:33.961
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

21:43.428 --> 21:45.305
Don't take drugs!

21:45.514 --> 21:47.683
"Don't take drugs!"

21:50.018 --> 21:52.145
Yes, Mother!

22:08.579 --> 22:10.706
Hi, I'm William Miller.

22:10.956 --> 22:14.626
I'm from <i>Creem</i> magazine
to interview Black Sabbath.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.131
Not on the list.

22:29.349 --> 22:32.978
- Sir, I'm a journalist...
- You're not on the list.

22:33.187 --> 22:36.148
Go to the top of the ramp
with the girls.

22:39.568 --> 22:41.778
We won't bite!

22:42.112 --> 22:44.031
What happens after I go to...

22:51.955 --> 22:53.624
Who are you with?

22:53.832 --> 22:55.083
Me?

22:55.292 --> 22:59.129
- I'm with myself.
- Who are you with? What band?

23:00.088 --> 23:04.218
I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
I'm a journalist.

23:04.593 --> 23:06.929
I'm not... Not a... You know.

23:07.179 --> 23:08.555
You're not a what?

23:14.561 --> 23:16.230
You're not a what?

23:16.438 --> 23:17.731
I'm not a...

23:18.941 --> 23:20.234
...groupie.

23:21.026 --> 23:23.987
We are not groupies.

23:24.238 --> 23:27.449
This is Penny Lane, man.
Show some respect.

23:27.658 --> 23:31.453
Groupies sleep with rock stars
because they're famous.

23:31.662 --> 23:34.832
We're here for the music.
We are "Band Aids."

23:35.040 --> 23:39.586
- She ran a school for Band Aids.
- We don't have intercourse.

23:39.795 --> 23:43.841
We inspire the music.
We're here because of the music.

23:44.049 --> 23:47.761
Marc Bolan broke her heart, man.
It's famous.

23:48.011 --> 23:50.138
It's a long story.

23:50.722 --> 23:54.142
I'm retired now.
Visiting friends.

23:54.351 --> 23:56.144
She changed everything.

23:56.353 --> 23:59.523
She was the one who said,
"No more sex.

23:59.731 --> 24:02.359
No exploiting
our bodies and hearts."

24:02.568 --> 24:04.945
- Right.
- Just blow jobs, that's it.

24:05.779 --> 24:09.658
- It's all happening!
- It's all happening!

24:14.371 --> 24:18.709
- It's all happening.
- This is our journalist friend.

24:18.917 --> 24:22.337
Journalist friend,
meet Polexia Aphrodisia...

24:22.546 --> 24:24.423
...Estrella Starr...

24:24.631 --> 24:27.718
...and you are...
- William Miller.

24:28.302 --> 24:31.513
- Here comes Sabbath!
- Ozzy, Tony, it's us!

24:32.598 --> 24:34.725
It's me, Polexia!

24:41.273 --> 24:42.816
I think I saw Sapphire.

24:44.985 --> 24:47.905
"Does anybody remember laughter?"

24:48.113 --> 24:49.281
Sapphire!

24:50.949 --> 24:52.201
Come on!

24:52.784 --> 24:55.829
Passes, girls!
Come and get them!

24:56.872 --> 25:00.000
- Oh, no, not this one.
- Who brought Opie?

25:00.375 --> 25:01.835
He's with us.

25:02.044 --> 25:06.089
- Don't go anywhere, Opie.
- I'll take care of this if I can.

25:23.148 --> 25:27.611
Come on, boys, pick it up!
We're an hour and a half late.

25:27.861 --> 25:30.072
I'm coming, I'm coming.

25:37.955 --> 25:42.960
Freddy! Open up!
It's Stillwater! We're on the show!

25:49.758 --> 25:52.761
I'm a journalist for <i>Creem</i> magazine.

25:52.970 --> 25:55.347
Oh, the Enemy. A rock writer.

25:55.556 --> 25:58.725
I'd like to interview you
or your band.

25:58.934 --> 26:02.479
Look. I'm sorry,
but could you please fuck off?!

26:02.688 --> 26:05.899
We play for the fans,
not the critics.

26:11.572 --> 26:12.698
Russell, Jeff...

26:12.948 --> 26:16.451
...Ed, Larry.
I really love your band.

26:16.660 --> 26:20.164
The song "Fever Dog"
is a big step forward for you.

26:20.372 --> 26:23.792
And you guys producing it
instead of Glyn Johns...

26:24.001 --> 26:29.047
...that was the right thing to do.
And Russell, the guitar sound...

26:29.965 --> 26:31.675
...is incendiary.

26:33.302 --> 26:35.345
Incendiary.

26:37.848 --> 26:39.266
Way to go.

26:45.564 --> 26:47.774
Hey, man! Don't stop there.

26:47.983 --> 26:51.778
- I'm incendiary too, man.
- I didn't mean "fuck off."

26:53.947 --> 26:56.783
- How are you doing?
- He's with us. This way, bro.

26:57.034 --> 27:00.537
- He's not on your list!
- Here's a list of people who belong.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.085
Hey, Red Dog!

27:07.294 --> 27:10.506
We're playing you
tomorrow night, man.

27:10.714 --> 27:13.258
- Yeah?
- How you doing, brother?

27:14.051 --> 27:15.135
Good to see you.

27:15.344 --> 27:18.430
The Allman Brothers Band's
number one roadie.

27:18.639 --> 27:22.684
- How are the guys?
- Having a ball, man. Having a ball.

27:22.893 --> 27:26.563
We have an Allman Brothers
Band party, man.

27:27.397 --> 27:30.817
Everybody's boogying,
getting off. It's like family.

27:31.068 --> 27:34.446
We got these now.
Check that out.

27:35.572 --> 27:38.325
You can taste the colour
with your mind.

27:39.451 --> 27:41.328
- You'll be in Maryland?
- Yeah.

27:41.537 --> 27:46.166
All right. Dickey and Gregg send
you their love.

27:47.501 --> 27:49.294
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy, brother.

27:49.503 --> 27:51.046
Good, man.

27:53.841 --> 27:59.680
People have a hard time explaining
rock, really explain rock'n'roll.

28:00.305 --> 28:03.392
Maybe Pete Townshend,
but that's okay.

28:03.851 --> 28:07.396
Rock'n'roll is a lifestyle
and a way of thinking...

28:07.646 --> 28:10.107
...and it's not about money
and popularity.

28:10.774 --> 28:14.027
Although, some money
would be nice.

28:14.278 --> 28:16.572
It's a voice that says,
"Here I am...

28:16.822 --> 28:20.284
...and fuck you
if you can't understand me."

28:20.492 --> 28:23.495
And one of these people
is gonna save the world.

28:23.745 --> 28:26.456
That means rock'n'roll
can save the world...

28:26.707 --> 28:28.584
...all of us together.

28:28.834 --> 28:33.338
And the chicks are great. But what
it all comes down to is that "thing."

28:33.589 --> 28:37.759
The indefinable thing when people
catch something from your music.

28:38.010 --> 28:42.014
- Wait, what am I talking about?
- The buzz.

28:42.264 --> 28:46.059
The buzz, and the chicks,
the whatever...

28:46.310 --> 28:48.437
...is an offshoot of the buzz.

28:48.645 --> 28:52.733
Like you saying you liked
"Fever Dog." That is the fucking buzz!

29:08.081 --> 29:09.958
Found you a pass.

29:12.085 --> 29:14.296
Thanks. I got in with Stillwater.

29:14.713 --> 29:16.798
Oh, Stillwater.

29:36.443 --> 29:38.904
Now you're mysterious.

29:43.116 --> 29:44.743
How old are you?

29:45.244 --> 29:47.871
- Eighteen.
- Me too.

29:48.872 --> 29:50.249
How old are we really?

29:51.625 --> 29:54.169
- Seventeen.
- Me too.

29:55.170 --> 29:57.256
Actually, I'm 16.

29:58.340 --> 29:59.383
Me too.

30:00.259 --> 30:03.637
Isn't it funny?
The truth just sounds different.

30:03.846 --> 30:05.597
I'm 15.

30:09.309 --> 30:10.811
What's your real name?

30:13.522 --> 30:15.190
I'll never tell.

30:18.652 --> 30:19.903
The Enemy!

30:21.321 --> 30:23.073
Russell! Hey.

30:23.699 --> 30:26.034
This is Penny Lane.

30:27.327 --> 30:29.788
Penny Lane, Russell Hammond.

30:32.749 --> 30:34.168
Pleasure.

30:34.668 --> 30:37.921
- Penny Lane, like the song.
- Have we met?

31:00.444 --> 31:02.988
Come here, man.
I wanna tell you something.

31:07.576 --> 31:08.911
It's...

31:09.119 --> 31:13.624
It's not what you put into it.
It's what you leave out.

31:13.832 --> 31:17.628
Listen to Marvin Gaye, a song
like "What's Happening Brother?"

31:17.836 --> 31:21.798
There's a single "woo" at the end
of the second verse.

31:22.007 --> 31:26.512
- You know that single woo?
- Yeah! I know that woo!

31:26.845 --> 31:31.058
Yeah! That's what you remember.
It's the silly things.

31:31.266 --> 31:35.312
The mistakes. There's only one
and it makes the song.

31:35.521 --> 31:41.026
It's what you leave out. That's
rock'n'roll, what you leave out.

31:41.860 --> 31:45.030
- You're the enemy. Are you 18?
- Yes.

31:45.239 --> 31:48.200
There you go, still young
enough to be honest.

31:50.035 --> 31:51.245
Bring the lights down.

32:01.547 --> 32:03.799
Hey, get the Enemy in here.

32:13.183 --> 32:16.103
- San Diego!
- Ready, baby?

32:23.318 --> 32:26.613
<i>Good evening, San Diego!</i>

32:26.864 --> 32:28.657
Stand right over there.

32:29.324 --> 32:32.244
<i>Would you please welcome...</i>

32:32.494 --> 32:34.621
<i>... from Troy, Michigan:</i>

32:35.622 --> 32:38.083
Stillwater!

34:29.527 --> 34:31.446
You want to come to L.A?

34:31.737 --> 34:33.782
We'll be at the Riot House all week.

34:34.032 --> 34:35.826
- Riot House?
- Yeah.

34:36.118 --> 34:38.328
The Continental Hyatt House.

34:38.871 --> 34:40.455
It's on Sunset Strip.

34:40.706 --> 34:43.125
Oh, yeah, right. Sunset Strip.

34:43.833 --> 34:47.295
Well, tell your friend...

34:47.670 --> 34:51.717
...Miss Penny Lane to call me.
Tell her:

34:51.967 --> 34:56.679
It ain't California without her.
We want her around, like last summer.

34:56.929 --> 34:58.974
Say it just like that.

34:59.892 --> 35:02.936
- Got it.
- I'm under "Harry Houdini."

35:05.105 --> 35:06.273
I get it.

35:07.024 --> 35:09.735
- Come on, let's blow this spot!
- Hey, Enemy.

35:09.985 --> 35:12.654
Come up to L.A.,
we'll talk some more.

35:12.905 --> 35:16.116
- Bye, Opie.
- See you later, Jeff, Polexia, Dick.

35:16.366 --> 35:20.996
Scully, Ed. See you, Mick, Gregg.
Later, guys.

35:23.248 --> 35:24.625
Bye, Opie.

35:27.294 --> 35:28.337
Bye.

35:30.255 --> 35:32.841
Hey, Red Dog.
I'll see you later, man.

35:33.091 --> 35:35.636
The Wheel.
Frosty.

35:36.720 --> 35:39.223
Ainsworth,
I'll see you around, man.

35:39.473 --> 35:41.517
- Penny!
- Hey, be cool.

35:41.767 --> 35:43.644
Penny, you just missed Russell.

35:43.852 --> 35:47.314
He's at the Riot House
and said for you to call.

35:47.523 --> 35:50.692
He's under the name Harry Houdini.

35:53.153 --> 35:57.407
- You know about the Riot House, right?
- I think I've heard of it.

35:57.658 --> 35:59.785
He had a message. He said:

36:00.035 --> 36:04.456
"It's not California without you.
We want you around like last summer."

36:04.665 --> 36:07.584
No! He said, "Tell her it ain't
California without..."

36:07.835 --> 36:10.504
- I get the gist.
- Right.

36:11.588 --> 36:14.883
So how well do you guys
know each other?

36:21.598 --> 36:26.019
Call me if you need a rescue.
We live in the same city.

36:27.271 --> 36:29.940
I think I live in a different world.

36:31.650 --> 36:33.777
Speaking of the world...

36:35.529 --> 36:37.698
...l've made a decision.

36:38.532 --> 36:41.869
I'm gonna live in Morocco
for one year.

36:46.373 --> 36:48.208
I need a new crowd.

36:51.670 --> 36:53.255
Do you want to come?

36:55.424 --> 36:56.800
Yes.

36:59.094 --> 37:01.805
- You sure?
- Ask me again.

37:02.431 --> 37:04.099
Do you want to come?

37:04.808 --> 37:05.851
Yes, yes.

37:08.770 --> 37:11.190
- You've gotta call me.
- Okay.

37:14.401 --> 37:15.527
It's all happening.

37:15.777 --> 37:17.571
It's all happening.
It's all happening.

37:20.449 --> 37:21.825
You all right?

37:22.075 --> 37:24.536
Yeah, yeah. Great.

37:42.846 --> 37:46.225
<i>And it's not about money</i>
<i>and popularity.</i>

37:54.525 --> 37:56.235
<i>And the chicks are great.</i>

38:02.699 --> 38:05.536
- Hey, Darryl.
- Hey.

38:13.710 --> 38:16.880
- So, your sister's a stewardess now.
- Yeah.

38:17.089 --> 38:18.632
She and Mom are still...

38:19.550 --> 38:23.512
I'd say not speaking,
but I don't know that they ever did.

38:23.720 --> 38:26.139
The things we did
inside these walls.

38:26.348 --> 38:28.684
That's okay.
I don't wanna know.

38:28.892 --> 38:31.979
- It is my room now.
- We flew the friendly skies.

38:32.437 --> 38:33.814
Okay, okay.

38:36.942 --> 38:38.110
You seem cooler.

38:39.611 --> 38:42.447
I am thinking
about going to Morocco.

38:43.031 --> 38:45.868
Tell me if you need
a little help with your mom.

38:46.076 --> 38:50.122
- A little may not be enough.
- She still freaks me out.

38:50.330 --> 38:52.457
- She's famous.
- Listen...

38:52.666 --> 38:55.502
Go ahead and do
whatever you were doing.

38:55.711 --> 39:00.174
- I'm just gonna hang in here a moment.
- Okay.

39:18.692 --> 39:20.736
I worry about drunk drivers.

39:20.944 --> 39:23.197
Mom, I'm 15.

39:23.405 --> 39:24.990
Right?

39:25.616 --> 39:28.076
Yes. You're 15.

39:28.535 --> 39:31.455
And, here's that money
I owe you.

39:32.414 --> 39:35.417
Your father's favourite joke.
I don't do it as well.

39:35.626 --> 39:38.295
No, I thought
that was pretty good.

39:38.504 --> 39:41.131
Small bills on the outside.
Call if they're drunk.

39:41.381 --> 39:44.676
I will call you if anyone,
anywhere, gets drunk.

39:45.135 --> 39:48.430
- And don't take drugs.
- Very funny.

39:49.014 --> 39:50.933
See? Sense of humour.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.811
Have fun at the dance.
I'm glad you're making friends.

39:55.062 --> 39:57.606
- Mom, stay.
- Okay.

39:58.857 --> 40:00.108
Love you.

40:00.484 --> 40:01.568
Goodbye.

40:16.583 --> 40:19.211
I always tell the girls,
"Never take it seriously.

40:19.419 --> 40:22.047
Never take it seriously,
you never get hurt.

40:22.297 --> 40:24.174
If you never get hurt,
you always have fun.

40:24.424 --> 40:26.718
And if you ever get lonely...

40:26.927 --> 40:31.306
...you just go to the record store
and visit your friends."

40:32.641 --> 40:34.518
- So you and Russell...
- No!

40:35.352 --> 40:39.731
Russell has a girlfriend,
and I can't even say her name.

40:51.910 --> 40:55.789
It's all happening.
I'm about to use you as protection.

40:55.998 --> 41:00.502
These guys are with Alice Cooper.
I'll pretend I don't know them.

41:00.711 --> 41:02.838
Does Alice know you're here?

41:03.046 --> 41:06.550
I'm just showing my very dear friend
William Miller around.

41:06.758 --> 41:09.303
He's a very good friend
of Lester Bangs.

41:09.511 --> 41:12.890
I'm responsible for his moral conduct.

41:13.098 --> 41:15.893
Penny Lane!
God's gift to rock'n'roll.

41:16.101 --> 41:18.729
I'm retired.
And don't argue with me!

41:18.979 --> 41:24.234
- Retired? Again?
- It's Reg. Humble Pie's road manager.

41:25.152 --> 41:27.571
Penny, come to Portland with us.

41:27.779 --> 41:29.823
- Have we met?
- Have we met?!

41:30.032 --> 41:33.994
I've made a decision.
I'm going travelling to India.

41:34.203 --> 41:36.538
And then, I'll learn to play
the violin.

41:36.747 --> 41:40.459
Then, I'll go to college
for one year.

41:40.667 --> 41:44.004
There's nothing they can teach you
in college.

41:44.796 --> 41:46.757
Call Alice, under the name
Bob Hope.

41:46.965 --> 41:51.512
- I heard you were with Russell.
- Please, I throw the little ones back!

41:51.720 --> 41:53.222
I lost my head!

41:53.430 --> 41:58.101
Martin Bell's a fucking asshole.
And I'm in love with Jeff.

41:58.310 --> 41:59.436
Polexia!

42:06.026 --> 42:07.611
Harry Houdini, please.

42:07.820 --> 42:10.030
- Houdini. Harry Houdini!
- It was Sable.

42:10.239 --> 42:13.534
- Who's Sable?
- We had this really great night.

42:13.784 --> 42:18.747
And he said it was going to mean
something. And I'm in love with Jeff!

42:28.882 --> 42:30.634
I saw them on the 7th floor.

42:30.884 --> 42:34.763
Mr. Jimmy Page, Mr. John Paul Jones,
Mr. Robert Plant.

42:34.972 --> 42:36.473
Mr. Robert Plant signed...

42:38.183 --> 42:40.602
...my T-shirt five minutes ago.

42:41.895 --> 42:43.981
Dude, please don't smear it.

42:44.231 --> 42:46.024
He touched this pen.

42:46.275 --> 42:48.735
- Vic is a Zeppelin fan.
- I picked that up.

42:48.944 --> 42:51.488
He tours with them,
but not "with" them.

42:51.738 --> 42:54.533
Yeah, they're on the 12th floor now.

42:54.867 --> 42:57.035
There's no bigger
Zeppelin fan than Vic.

43:03.208 --> 43:06.253
Very dear, very close
friend of Lester Bangs.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.755
William Miller.

43:10.132 --> 43:12.176
Hey, you're that comedian.

43:12.384 --> 43:15.846
- Leonard!
- Blow me!

43:18.265 --> 43:20.767
Okay, time to put on
the lampshade.

43:22.603 --> 43:26.273
Ladies and gentlemen!

43:27.232 --> 43:30.903
At this time, please extinguish
all smoking materials...

43:31.153 --> 43:34.781
...for the captain has turned on
the "No Smoking" sign.

43:35.032 --> 43:38.744
Your seats and tray tables
should be locked...

43:38.994 --> 43:41.413
...and in their full
upright position.

43:51.048 --> 43:52.674
The hell with it.

43:53.675 --> 43:55.802
- Play on.
- Miss Penny Lane.

43:57.012 --> 43:58.514
Thank you. Thank you.

44:03.936 --> 44:08.315
Act One, in which she pretends
she doesn't care...

44:08.690 --> 44:10.400
...about him.

44:13.153 --> 44:18.116
Act Two, in which he pretends
he doesn't care about her...

44:18.325 --> 44:21.036
...but he goes right for her.

44:25.707 --> 44:30.462
Act Three, in which it all plays out
the way she planned it.

44:31.213 --> 44:33.340
She'll eat him alive.

44:33.715 --> 44:34.800
We've gotta stop them.

44:35.008 --> 44:36.677
Stop them?

44:38.554 --> 44:42.391
You were her excuse for coming here.

44:46.687 --> 44:48.355
I need ice.

45:01.285 --> 45:03.954
I'm worried about people
using her.

45:04.538 --> 45:09.710
She brings out the good in everybody
else, but what do they do for her?

45:10.419 --> 45:14.214
It kills me.
Do you have any pot?

45:14.840 --> 45:18.051
No. Not on me.

45:19.303 --> 45:22.347
- Do you smoke?
- No.

45:24.016 --> 45:26.602
But I grow it.

45:27.936 --> 45:29.146
Yeah.

45:29.980 --> 45:32.608
- Grow it.
- You're funny.

45:32.858 --> 45:38.614
Funny. If you were only taller and
English and rich and a guitar player.

45:38.822 --> 45:41.158
And older.

45:41.700 --> 45:45.078
I'd...
I'd be somebody else.

45:45.287 --> 45:48.332
Yeah, good point.

45:50.584 --> 45:52.336
The Enemy.

45:53.670 --> 45:56.548
I'm always around if
you wanna talk more.

45:56.757 --> 45:58.509
- Okay.
- All right.

45:59.384 --> 46:02.971
Bless me, Father,
for I may sin tonight.

46:27.663 --> 46:30.249
How does it end?

46:30.457 --> 46:31.542
What?

46:32.000 --> 46:36.797
The story about the girl who dumps the
guy who has the ex, ex-wife.

46:38.048 --> 46:40.634
Calls her a hundred, okay...

46:40.843 --> 46:46.265
...five times and doesn't even leave
a pass in San Diego.

46:46.473 --> 46:48.267
Wake up.

46:49.226 --> 46:51.019
I'm retired.

46:52.312 --> 46:57.401
I never believed you anyway.
You're too good-looking and talented.

46:57.609 --> 47:01.113
You're retired like Frank Sinatra
is retired.

47:01.321 --> 47:06.076
Miss Penny Lane, let me tell
you what rock'n'roll will miss.

47:06.493 --> 47:09.204
The day that you truly retire.

47:11.748 --> 47:15.043
The way you turn a hotel room
into a home.

47:15.252 --> 47:17.963
The way you pick up strays
wherever you go.

47:19.673 --> 47:23.468
The way you know the words
to every song.

47:23.677 --> 47:26.263
Every song.
Especially the bad ones.

47:26.471 --> 47:29.057
Mostly the bad ones.

47:29.600 --> 47:33.353
That green coat
in the middle of summer.

47:34.938 --> 47:38.233
The real name
that you won't reveal.

47:42.821 --> 47:45.365
I could keep going,
but my glass is full.

47:46.241 --> 47:47.784
Damn.

48:08.138 --> 48:10.390
Come to Arizona?

48:11.475 --> 48:12.601
Never.

48:12.809 --> 48:17.481
We leave Thursday morning at 9 a.m.,
and pack light this time. Jesus.

48:30.577 --> 48:32.788
- William Miller?
- <i>This is he.</i>

48:33.038 --> 48:36.375
This is Ben Fong-Torres.
I'm the music editor at <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

48:37.167 --> 48:40.546
We got some copies of your stories
from the <i>San Diego Door.</i>

48:40.921 --> 48:43.715
- Is this the same William Miller?
- Yes, it is.

48:43.966 --> 48:47.636
"Voice of <i>God," "Howling Dogs,"
"The Spirit of Rock'n'roll."</i>

48:47.886 --> 48:50.097
- This is good stuff, man.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

48:51.098 --> 48:52.724
Thanks. Thanks.

48:52.975 --> 48:55.352
I think you should be
writing for us. Any ideas?

48:58.856 --> 49:01.650
- How about Stillwater?
- Stillwater?

49:02.484 --> 49:06.196
"Hardworking band makes good."
New album out, their third.

49:06.446 --> 49:08.699
Starting to do something. Crazy.

49:09.032 --> 49:12.452
<i>Let's do 3000 words.</i>
<i>We'll join the band on the road.</i>

49:12.703 --> 49:14.454
Don't let the band pay for anything.

49:15.330 --> 49:18.667
We can only pay, let me see,
3000 words...

49:20.502 --> 49:21.587
$700.

49:24.590 --> 49:25.632
All right, a grand.

49:26.884 --> 49:29.720
What's your background?
Are you a journalism major?

49:31.221 --> 49:33.348
- Yeah.
- <i>What college?</i>

49:33.557 --> 49:36.935
<i>I need you to do that thing</i>
<i>that fixes the garbage disposal.</i>

49:43.525 --> 49:46.904
I certainly know how my lady gets
when you don't snap to it.

49:47.446 --> 49:49.740
- <i>Crazy.</i>
- <i>Crazy.</i>

49:50.866 --> 49:51.909
<i>Stillwater?</i>

49:52.409 --> 49:53.785
<i>Beware, beware...</i>

49:53.994 --> 49:56.580
...of <i>Rolling Stone.</i>
They'll change your story...

49:58.248 --> 50:01.502
...they'll rewrite it, you know,
turn it into swill.

50:01.752 --> 50:04.296
Besides that,
what would be wrong with it?

50:05.631 --> 50:08.717
You got starry eyes, my friend.

50:09.343 --> 50:12.471
Look, do the story.

50:12.971 --> 50:16.016
Who cares, you know?
It'll be good for you.

50:16.558 --> 50:19.061
Remember this: Don't do it...

50:19.311 --> 50:22.606
...to make friends with people
who are trying to use you...

50:22.856 --> 50:27.027
...to further
the big-business desire...

50:27.277 --> 50:30.614
<i>... to glorify worthless rock stars</i>
<i>like Stillwater.</i>

50:30.906 --> 50:33.742
<i>Don't let those</i>
<i>swill merchants rewrite you.</i>

50:34.660 --> 50:37.579
- "Swill merchants." That's good.
- <i>Yeah, swill merchants.</i>

50:39.832 --> 50:42.125
- What are you listening to?
- Stillwater.

50:42.376 --> 50:45.420
Stillwater?
Fucking kid's doing drugs.

50:45.963 --> 50:49.091
No, no, no, no.

50:49.299 --> 50:52.928
No more than four days and I want
a phone number where you are.

50:53.178 --> 50:57.391
Call me twice a day, and do not
miss more than one test!

51:01.562 --> 51:03.647
And no drugs.

51:04.231 --> 51:07.192
Oh, this is a big mistake.

51:28.297 --> 51:31.133
Come on, Doris, you darling bus.
You can make it.

51:43.020 --> 51:47.107
- This is what I was talking about.
- Russell, excuse me.

51:47.316 --> 51:50.944
I was wondering if we could
talk when we get to Phoenix.

51:51.445 --> 51:54.781
I want to interview everybody
and want to start with...

51:54.990 --> 51:57.326
...just you and me.
- Absolutely.

51:57.784 --> 52:00.204
I've got a thing in a couple days.

52:00.412 --> 52:04.124
- What?
- Oh, it's a thing.

52:04.625 --> 52:06.960
Where you go there
to graduate.

52:08.629 --> 52:09.671
School.

52:11.465 --> 52:14.051
I never graduated.
Look what happened.

52:14.259 --> 52:17.054
You're here interviewing me.

52:19.181 --> 52:21.725
No, no, no, no.

52:22.684 --> 52:27.815
Don't put that in <i>Rolling Stone.</i>
In our bios, we all graduated.

52:28.023 --> 52:29.817
Him with honours.

52:30.192 --> 52:32.820
We'll figure out something
later, okay?

52:34.154 --> 52:35.864
Just enjoy the ride.

52:36.114 --> 52:38.951
- Keep playing that song.
- All right.

52:57.886 --> 53:01.640
I need to stay in your room.
Russell's in a bad mood.

53:01.849 --> 53:05.894
He's very Bob Dylan in <i>Don't</i>
<i>Look Back.</i> He's trying to write.

53:06.103 --> 53:08.939
Yeah, sure.

53:09.148 --> 53:10.607
- Yeah?
- Sure.

53:10.816 --> 53:12.568
You okay?

53:12.943 --> 53:14.736
Yeah.

53:32.546 --> 53:35.257
Come by in a few minutes
for that interview.

53:35.465 --> 53:36.925
Sure.

53:39.761 --> 53:41.680
Is this Mr. Miller?

53:41.889 --> 53:42.973
Yeah.

53:43.223 --> 53:45.392
You have a message from Elaine.

53:45.642 --> 53:46.935
Your mother.

53:47.603 --> 53:49.229
She's a handful.

53:50.981 --> 53:53.525
- I know.
- She freaked me out.

53:55.110 --> 53:56.737
Tell her to stop.

54:05.537 --> 54:07.247
I'm worried, man.

54:09.625 --> 54:11.627
No, you can trust him.
He's a fan.

54:11.835 --> 54:13.670
But it's <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

54:13.921 --> 54:18.133
He looks harmless, but he represents
the magazine that trashed "Layla"...

54:18.383 --> 54:21.845
...broke up Cream, ripped every album
Led Zeppelin ever made.

54:22.095 --> 54:26.308
Don't forget the rules. He is
the Enemy. He writes what he sees.

54:26.558 --> 54:30.145
If I don't get into a room
and take a Valium...

54:30.354 --> 54:33.315
Although it would be cool
to be on the cover.

54:33.565 --> 54:36.026
You're gonna get me in trouble.

54:37.236 --> 54:40.072
You're so trying to get
me into so much trouble.

54:42.616 --> 54:43.659
Oh, my God.

54:44.243 --> 54:47.621
Simon Kirke from Bad Company
is by the pool.

54:57.923 --> 54:59.508
Housekeeping.

55:00.634 --> 55:02.094
Housekeeping.

55:03.345 --> 55:04.680
Go away!

55:05.806 --> 55:07.683
Should I come by later?

55:08.058 --> 55:11.645
Yes. I'm in too truthful a mood!

55:11.895 --> 55:14.356
- Maybe that's a good thing.
- Go away!

55:17.526 --> 55:18.694
You okay?

55:18.944 --> 55:20.279
Yeah.

55:21.071 --> 55:22.114
Go away!

55:22.322 --> 55:25.534
Don't worry. Come to
the radio interview tonight. Okay?

55:25.784 --> 55:26.952
Go away!

55:28.162 --> 55:29.496
- Bye.
- You're so rude.

56:30.474 --> 56:34.186
The guitar and songwriting
of Russell Hammond.

56:34.394 --> 56:39.817
Vocal stylings of
Jeff "Bebay." Jeff "Babey." "Babay."

56:40.984 --> 56:43.904
- "Bebe."
- Bebe.

56:44.112 --> 56:45.197
"Fever Dog."

56:45.489 --> 56:47.574
The band is Stillwater.

56:47.783 --> 56:51.453
Watch with your mind
as they materialize.

56:58.377 --> 57:01.922
Look at the dogs wearing the funny
hats juggling just for you...

57:02.130 --> 57:05.092
...freaks and family.

57:05.300 --> 57:06.635
It's Quince...

57:07.010 --> 57:10.639
...with Stillwater, here, live.
It's the Night Circus.

57:12.599 --> 57:15.561
Every minute a baby
is born somewhere.

57:15.769 --> 57:18.063
Life. Death.

57:18.272 --> 57:20.816
Hermetically sealed bags
of human emotion.

57:21.233 --> 57:23.485
Bags of love.

57:24.027 --> 57:25.779
Bags of kindness.

57:29.575 --> 57:31.243
How'd y'all get together?

57:37.082 --> 57:41.170
Not to get into a me thing,
but I did start the band...

57:41.378 --> 57:46.300
...sometime ago and I placed
an ad in a magazine called <i>Peaches.</i>

57:46.508 --> 57:48.886
And Russell Hammond answered.

57:49.344 --> 57:50.387
<i>Peaches.</i>

57:50.596 --> 57:54.016
It was a gift from God.
Nobody plays like Russell.

57:54.892 --> 57:57.561
Shit, man. Thank you.

58:00.731 --> 58:03.775
You might wanna hit
that delay button, Quincy.

58:14.077 --> 58:16.121
Quince?

58:20.125 --> 58:22.336
Now we're talking, right?

58:24.004 --> 58:25.464
Right?

58:26.089 --> 58:30.010
Why the fuck wait for an interview
to say something nice about me?

58:30.219 --> 58:35.390
Why not say it to my fucking face? I
tell you every time you nail something.

58:35.599 --> 58:37.768
Everybody pays you compliments.

58:37.976 --> 58:43.732
It's not my fucking job
to kiss your fucking ass.

58:43.941 --> 58:48.779
Whose fucking job is it?
Because my ass is dying for a kiss.

58:48.987 --> 58:50.989
I know yours is too.

58:51.198 --> 58:53.408
It's my fucking job.
I think you're all geniuses.

58:53.617 --> 58:57.204
And to all the folks out there:
Smegma.

58:57.412 --> 58:58.455
Nice.

58:58.664 --> 58:59.873
Fellas.

59:00.290 --> 59:01.834
Feces.

59:03.919 --> 59:06.255
The song is "Love Thing."

59:06.505 --> 59:09.091
Your mind is starting
to take effect.

59:09.299 --> 59:12.177
They've come to watch you
swallow fire.

59:12.386 --> 59:13.679
You scream...

59:13.887 --> 59:15.764
...soundlessly...

59:16.014 --> 59:18.475
...on the Night Circus.

59:22.521 --> 59:25.941
- I thought that went well.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

59:29.778 --> 59:30.821
<i>Pronto.</i>

59:31.029 --> 59:34.158
- May I speak with William?
- <i>He's in the bar with the band.</i>

59:34.408 --> 59:38.120
They're back from the radio station.
Is this Maryann with the pot?

59:40.956 --> 59:41.999
Hello?

59:44.710 --> 59:47.462
No. This is not
Maryann with the pot.

59:47.713 --> 59:49.840
This is Elaine, his mother.

59:52.384 --> 59:54.678
Could you give William
a message, please?

59:55.470 --> 59:58.515
<i>Tell him to call home immediately.</i>
<i>And also tell him...</i>

59:59.474 --> 01:00:02.686
...I know what's going on.

01:00:02.936 --> 01:00:06.732
Okay. But I'm just gonna say this,
and I'm gonna stand by it:

01:00:06.982 --> 01:00:09.276
You should be really proud of him.

01:00:09.526 --> 01:00:12.154
Because I know men,
and I'll bet you do too.

01:00:12.404 --> 01:00:15.282
<i>He respects women,</i>
<i>and he likes women.</i>

01:00:15.491 --> 01:00:18.619
<i>And let's just pause</i>
<i>and appreciate a man like that.</i>

01:00:18.869 --> 01:00:21.997
You created him out of thin air.
You raised him right.

01:00:22.247 --> 01:00:24.708
He's having a great time.
He's doing a good job.

01:00:24.958 --> 01:00:29.630
<i>Don't worry, he's still a virgin,</i>
<i>and we're all looking out for him.</i>

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.300
You know? That's more than I've
ever said to my own parents.

01:00:34.676 --> 01:00:36.011
<i>So there you go.</i>

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:40.849
<i>This is a maid speaking,</i>
<i>by the way.</i>

01:00:41.892 --> 01:00:45.312
- Can you please hold it down?
- Sorry, ma'am!

01:00:50.776 --> 01:00:54.905
Russell. So, what is it
you love about music?

01:00:55.364 --> 01:00:58.659
Shut that thing off and I'll tell you
the truth, all right?

01:01:01.203 --> 01:01:05.499
Look. Fuck, I trust you, so I'm
just gonna lay this right on you.

01:01:08.502 --> 01:01:10.379
Just make us look cool.

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:17.219
I will quote you
warmly and accurately.

01:01:17.469 --> 01:01:20.764
Well, that's what I'm worried about.

01:01:22.057 --> 01:01:26.311
You see, some of us have girlfriends
back home, you know?

01:01:27.396 --> 01:01:29.731
Some of us have wives.

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.861
And some of the people
that you meet on the road...

01:01:34.194 --> 01:01:36.905
...are really amazing people.

01:01:43.328 --> 01:01:44.454
Like you.

01:01:47.541 --> 01:01:50.210
Some of the stuff that happens,
it's good for...

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:53.297
...a few people to know about,
as opposed to, say...

01:01:55.632 --> 01:01:56.925
...a million people.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.221
- Understand what I'm trying to say?
- Yeah.

01:02:03.223 --> 01:02:05.851
They say you're dangerous.

01:02:06.518 --> 01:02:09.480
You see everything.
Most people...

01:02:09.688 --> 01:02:11.899
...are just waiting to talk.

01:02:12.107 --> 01:02:14.193
But you listen.

01:02:15.861 --> 01:02:19.740
I grew up with these guys,
but I can't play all that I can play.

01:02:20.449 --> 01:02:23.076
I'm past them, as musicians, but...

01:02:23.285 --> 01:02:26.622
...the more popular we get,
the bigger their houses get...

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:29.124
...the more responsibilities,
the pressure.

01:02:29.374 --> 01:02:33.170
The harder it gets
for me to walk out on them.

01:02:33.378 --> 01:02:35.047
Then you forget.

01:02:35.255 --> 01:02:39.426
Forget what it's like
to be a fan.

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.388
It doesn't sound like music anymore.

01:02:43.597 --> 01:02:45.057
It sounds like...

01:02:46.183 --> 01:02:49.228
...lifestyle maintenance,
or something.

01:02:49.937 --> 01:02:52.773
"Lifestyle maintenance."
That's...

01:02:55.776 --> 01:02:58.195
I used to be able to hear...

01:03:00.697 --> 01:03:02.866
...the sounds of the world.

01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:07.162
To me, it sounded like music.

01:03:08.247 --> 01:03:10.082
Now, I don't hear it...

01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:12.584
...anymore.

01:03:21.176 --> 01:03:23.554
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:03:23.804 --> 01:03:26.265
Yeah.

01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:32.312
What am I doing?

01:03:32.646 --> 01:03:38.068
I'm telling secrets to the one guy
you don't tell secrets to.

01:03:40.487 --> 01:03:41.530
No.

01:03:43.699 --> 01:03:45.492
We'll do the interview tomorrow.

01:03:47.536 --> 01:03:49.037
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:03:49.955 --> 01:03:52.040
So tonight it's...

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:53.834
Well, friends.

01:03:54.042 --> 01:03:56.628
- Yeah, right.
- We trust you.

01:03:56.962 --> 01:03:58.672
Larry Fellows...

01:03:58.922 --> 01:04:01.925
What is your role in Stillwater?

01:04:02.176 --> 01:04:06.180
What is the chemical
you add to the chemistry?

01:04:09.224 --> 01:04:11.185
I'm the bass player.

01:04:12.478 --> 01:04:13.896
Right.

01:04:14.396 --> 01:04:17.232
And when you take that away...

01:04:17.441 --> 01:04:20.569
...what would be missing,
stylistically?

01:04:20.819 --> 01:04:23.071
What chemical?

01:04:26.366 --> 01:04:28.285
A bass?

01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:31.413
Okay.

01:05:18.502 --> 01:05:21.755
- What's going on?
- Russell got electrocuted!

01:05:25.634 --> 01:05:27.719
Okay, everybody be cool!

01:05:28.595 --> 01:05:32.141
Come on! Let's get on the bus!
Let's go!

01:05:32.391 --> 01:05:35.644
Who's taking care of us?
What about the gear?

01:05:35.853 --> 01:05:37.646
I'll deal with it. Get on the bus!

01:05:37.896 --> 01:05:40.482
- Come on! Let's go!
- Hey, cowboy.

01:05:40.691 --> 01:05:42.651
- You the manager?
- That and more.

01:05:42.901 --> 01:05:44.695
You didn't finish your full set, man.

01:05:44.945 --> 01:05:48.615
Listen, pal. Your shoddy stage setup
almost killed my guitarist!

01:05:48.866 --> 01:05:52.035
You trashed my dressing room
and didn't do 25 minutes!

01:05:52.286 --> 01:05:55.038
- Don't fuck with my band's safety!
- Fuck you, man!

01:05:55.247 --> 01:05:57.457
I'm gonna report you
to every promoter in this country!

01:05:57.708 --> 01:06:01.128
- I'll call Frank Barcelona!
- You don't know him!

01:06:01.336 --> 01:06:03.088
You're all amateurs!

01:06:03.922 --> 01:06:05.507
- Come on!
- You want it?

01:06:05.757 --> 01:06:07.759
What do you got?

01:06:10.888 --> 01:06:12.556
Watch the shirt, fuck!

01:06:12.764 --> 01:06:14.975
I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:06:15.559 --> 01:06:17.060
Take it easy, man.

01:06:17.269 --> 01:06:19.313
I hope you got a lawyer.

01:06:20.063 --> 01:06:23.192
Make a live album!
This is your last tour!

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.987
What? What? What is that?
What are you, Bruce Lee?

01:06:27.196 --> 01:06:28.822
Come on.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.701
Take it easy.

01:06:33.452 --> 01:06:34.953
Lock the gates!

01:06:36.038 --> 01:06:39.291
Go through the fucking gate.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.585
Lock the gates on these fuckheads!

01:06:41.793 --> 01:06:44.254
- Where's my goddamn cart?
- William?

01:06:48.258 --> 01:06:50.928
I forgot to tell you.
Your mom called.

01:06:51.136 --> 01:06:53.472
She says you gotta
call home immediately.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.184
And she says to tell you,
"I know what's going on."

01:06:57.392 --> 01:07:00.562
So I'll see you guys in Topeka, okay?

01:07:05.275 --> 01:07:08.695
Amateurs! You don't know
who you're dealing with!

01:07:08.904 --> 01:07:09.947
Lock the gates!

01:07:16.203 --> 01:07:18.664
- You want to buy a gate?
- Yeah!

01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:24.795
<i>You just bought a gate!</i>

01:07:46.608 --> 01:07:49.069
Hey. Give that to me, William.

01:07:53.574 --> 01:07:56.201
Give me that.

01:08:04.668 --> 01:08:05.711
Russell, wake up.

01:08:06.712 --> 01:08:09.882
Wake up. It's a girls' running team.

01:08:10.883 --> 01:08:12.467
Goddamn!

01:08:12.801 --> 01:08:15.179
Let it go, fellas. Let it go, buddy.

01:08:15.387 --> 01:08:17.430
When are we getting to Topeka, man?

01:08:17.639 --> 01:08:20.684
- Larry, you're a sick individual.
- Wake up, man.

01:08:21.185 --> 01:08:24.188
Look at all the tasty-looking
high school girls.

01:08:24.395 --> 01:08:27.858
We can't stop the bus
for every girl in shorts.

01:08:28.066 --> 01:08:30.486
Hey, when we go to Morocco...

01:08:30.694 --> 01:08:33.154
...we should wear
completely different clothes...

01:08:33.363 --> 01:08:35.491
...and be completely different people.

01:08:36.033 --> 01:08:37.993
What will our names be?

01:08:47.419 --> 01:08:49.212
What do you think of Russell?

01:08:52.006 --> 01:08:53.383
I like him.

01:08:53.716 --> 01:08:57.136
But that's between us.
Because I am a professional.

01:08:57.805 --> 01:09:01.475
Give them a break.
There are problems in the band.

01:09:01.725 --> 01:09:05.437
- Off the record.
- What problems?

01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:07.898
Okay, I got it.

01:09:08.148 --> 01:09:12.736
Your name should be Spencer,
and mine will be Jane.

01:09:14.696 --> 01:09:19.408
- I can't keep up with you.
- Oh, no one can.

01:09:23.412 --> 01:09:26.291
You're coming to Cleveland, right?

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:31.087
Cleveland, Ohio?
Oh, no, no, no.

01:09:31.296 --> 01:09:34.800
I have to get my interview
with Russell before Greenville.

01:09:35.216 --> 01:09:40.180
- You've got to help me, okay?
- Here's the thing about Russell.

01:09:40.389 --> 01:09:41.723
He's my last project.

01:09:41.932 --> 01:09:46.435
I only do this for a very few people,
and I think we should do it together.

01:09:46.645 --> 01:09:50.357
Because all the guys are good,
but he could be great.

01:09:54.153 --> 01:09:55.571
What's your real name?

01:10:01.285 --> 01:10:03.287
All right, let's go.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.170
Oh, it's okay. I'm easy to forget.

01:10:11.378 --> 01:10:12.921
Just leave me behind!

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:16.925
I'm only the fucking lead singer!

01:10:19.678 --> 01:10:24.475
So, Ed Vallencourt,
what do you love about music?

01:10:39.823 --> 01:10:42.451
<i>You said you'd tell me where you were.</i>

01:10:42.701 --> 01:10:44.870
- <i>And call twice a day.</i>
- I know!

01:10:45.704 --> 01:10:48.665
- You said you wouldn't miss any tests.
- <i>I'll be home for graduation.</i>

01:10:48.874 --> 01:10:50.542
- Mom...
- <i>Where are you?</i>

01:10:50.751 --> 01:10:53.670
Right now, Topeka,
then Greenville, then home.

01:10:53.879 --> 01:10:56.757
<i>What about graduation?</i>
<i>We had an agreement.</i>

01:10:56.965 --> 01:10:59.301
I'm sorry I didn't call
you yesterday.

01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:03.430
I miss you and I don't understand
why I've driven my kids so far away.

01:11:03.639 --> 01:11:06.433
<i>By all rules, don't I
<i>get you for another three years?</i></i>

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.812
Was I not fun?

01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:11.438
<i>Yes.</i>

01:11:12.397 --> 01:11:14.233
This is Beth from Denver.

01:11:14.441 --> 01:11:17.319
She's one of the legendary
original Band Aids.

01:11:17.528 --> 01:11:20.739
- She's clairvoyant!
- I can't read your mind or anything.

01:11:20.948 --> 01:11:23.826
<i>I mean, I pick up things</i>
<i>here and there.</i>

01:11:24.034 --> 01:11:25.369
Estrella says hi.

01:11:25.577 --> 01:11:29.456
- She says I can stay in your room.
- Sure.

01:11:29.748 --> 01:11:31.917
<i>Great! I've got some...</i>

01:11:32.167 --> 01:11:34.294
...hydroponic pot!

01:11:34.503 --> 01:11:37.756
Wow, your aura is really fantastic!

01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:41.009
- It's this beautiful purple colour.
- <i>I love you.</i>

01:11:41.218 --> 01:11:43.178
I missed the last thing you said.

01:11:43.387 --> 01:11:45.806
- <i>Your aura is purple!</i>
- I love you.

01:11:46.014 --> 01:11:48.392
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Purple! It's purple!</i>

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.562
- <i>Mom, what?</i>
- <i>Your aura is purple!</i>

01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:54.189
I miss you and I love you!

01:11:54.398 --> 01:11:56.358
I love you.

01:12:26.138 --> 01:12:27.181
All right.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:29.975
Fire away. I'm ready.

01:12:30.184 --> 01:12:32.561
Do you have to be sad
to write a sad song...

01:12:32.769 --> 01:12:34.646
...and in love to write a love song?

01:12:35.105 --> 01:12:38.025
Is a song better
if it really happened to you?

01:12:38.233 --> 01:12:42.905
Like "Love Thing." Where did you
write that? Who is it about?

01:12:44.531 --> 01:12:46.450
When did you get so professional?

01:12:48.744 --> 01:12:53.248
Gentlemen, your first
T-shirts have arrived.

01:13:13.268 --> 01:13:17.272
It's the record company's mistake,
and they will pay.

01:13:18.774 --> 01:13:22.027
T-shirts are gone... band happy.
All right?

01:13:24.363 --> 01:13:28.408
Can we just skip the vibe and go
straight to us laughing about this?

01:13:28.617 --> 01:13:29.660
Yeah, okay.

01:13:29.993 --> 01:13:32.246
I can see you want to get into it.

01:13:32.454 --> 01:13:36.542
How can you tell?
I'm just one of the out-of-focus guys.

01:13:37.167 --> 01:13:38.502
Here.

01:13:39.795 --> 01:13:42.172
Let's take a good look at it,
all right?

01:13:43.841 --> 01:13:45.968
See, you love this T-shirt.

01:13:46.176 --> 01:13:48.345
It lets you say
everything you want.

01:13:49.012 --> 01:13:51.181
Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.

01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:54.059
It's a T-shirt.

01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:57.354
Do you give a shit about a T-shirt?

01:13:57.563 --> 01:14:01.191
I'm just hungry. Let's just go
find some barbecue or something.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.026
I'll always tell you the truth.

01:14:03.235 --> 01:14:04.778
You doing coke again?

01:14:05.529 --> 01:14:07.364
Oh, yeah, all the time.

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:09.950
This is big stuff, man.

01:14:10.159 --> 01:14:13.036
From the very beginning,
we said I'm the front man...

01:14:13.245 --> 01:14:15.622
...and you're the guitarist
with mystique.

01:14:15.831 --> 01:14:17.875
That's the dynamic we agreed on.

01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:21.378
Page, Plant. Mick, Keith.

01:14:22.171 --> 01:14:23.839
Blackmore, Gillan.

01:14:24.089 --> 01:14:26.258
But somehow it's all turning around.

01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:28.969
We have got to control
what's happening!

01:14:29.344 --> 01:14:32.347
- There's a responsibility here.
- Excuse me.

01:14:32.556 --> 01:14:36.018
Didn't we all get into this
to avoid responsibility?

01:14:36.226 --> 01:14:38.979
I can't say any more
with the writer here.

01:14:39.771 --> 01:14:42.733
Trust him. Say what you want.

01:14:42.941 --> 01:14:47.571
I work as hard, or harder,
than anybody on that stage.

01:14:48.363 --> 01:14:51.283
You know what I do? I connect.

01:14:51.992 --> 01:14:53.911
I get people off!

01:14:54.161 --> 01:14:57.080
I look for the one guy
who isn't getting off...

01:14:57.289 --> 01:14:59.625
...and I make him get off.

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:01.668
Actually, that you can print!

01:15:03.587 --> 01:15:07.591
And yet, why do I always end up
feeling like I'm a joke to you?

01:15:08.592 --> 01:15:12.387
You want to pretend this won't be
a very big band? Well, it is!

01:15:12.596 --> 01:15:14.807
You call yourself
a leader of this band...

01:15:15.349 --> 01:15:17.601
...but your direction
allowed this T-shirt...

01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:22.523
...when you allowed Dick to manage us.
Because he's your friend!

01:15:22.731 --> 01:15:25.984
Don't you see, man?
The T-shirt is everything.

01:15:26.401 --> 01:15:30.739
Is it my turn now? I think we should,
for once, say what we really mean.

01:15:30.948 --> 01:15:34.618
- This is the part where you quit!
- Right, I'm so predictable.

01:15:34.827 --> 01:15:36.328
Deal with it.

01:15:36.537 --> 01:15:39.039
- I'll say what nobody else will say.
- What?!

01:15:39.248 --> 01:15:41.959
Your looks have become a problem!

01:15:42.501 --> 01:15:44.753
All right, okay, enough! Break it up.

01:15:44.962 --> 01:15:47.589
Everyone out of the room
for five minutes.

01:15:51.093 --> 01:15:52.136
Hey!

01:15:52.344 --> 01:15:54.263
Yeah. William. Sorry.

01:15:56.515 --> 01:15:58.517
Come on, man. Come on.

01:15:58.725 --> 01:16:01.770
Let's go find something real.

01:16:08.318 --> 01:16:11.071
From here on out, I'm only
interested in what is real.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.990
Real people, real feelings.

01:16:13.198 --> 01:16:16.034
That's all I'm interested in
from here on out.

01:16:17.703 --> 01:16:19.163
You're real.

01:16:20.664 --> 01:16:22.499
- Thanks.
- You know...

01:16:22.833 --> 01:16:26.044
...you know all about us,
and I don't know shit about you.

01:16:28.714 --> 01:16:30.674
Tell me, what's your family like?

01:16:33.469 --> 01:16:35.429
My dad died of a heart attack.

01:16:35.637 --> 01:16:38.182
My sister believes
that my mom is so intense...

01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:40.517
...that she had to escape our family.

01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:43.437
They can't find a way
to get through it.

01:16:43.645 --> 01:16:45.481
They don't even speak anymore.

01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:49.693
Plus, she gave me all her albums,
and now she's a stewardess.

01:16:53.697 --> 01:16:55.365
It's good to talk about.

01:16:56.575 --> 01:16:59.828
Really good.
But here I am telling secrets...

01:17:00.037 --> 01:17:03.415
...to the one guy you're not supposed
to tell your secrets to.

01:17:07.586 --> 01:17:09.379
You're Russell from Stillwater.

01:17:10.964 --> 01:17:14.551
Well, yeah, on my better days
I am Russell from Stillwater.

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.970
Want to go to my friend Aaron's party?

01:17:17.179 --> 01:17:19.014
I know you're
a big rock star and all...

01:17:19.306 --> 01:17:22.559
...but want to hang with good people
and have a good time?

01:17:23.811 --> 01:17:27.481
We're just real Topeka people, man.

01:17:49.419 --> 01:17:52.840
Oh, my God. Holy shit. Fuck!

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.300
I grew up with that lampshade.

01:17:56.051 --> 01:17:59.346
I love this kitchen.
I fucking love this kitchen!

01:18:07.062 --> 01:18:09.648
That's William over there.
Hey, William!

01:18:12.109 --> 01:18:16.196
You, Aaron, are what it's all about.

01:18:17.072 --> 01:18:18.532
You're real.

01:18:19.158 --> 01:18:20.659
Your room is real.

01:18:20.909 --> 01:18:23.245
Your friends are real.

01:18:23.453 --> 01:18:27.291
Real, man, real. You know? Real.

01:18:30.711 --> 01:18:32.504
Real, you know?

01:18:36.133 --> 01:18:41.263
You're more important
than all the silly machinery.

01:18:42.264 --> 01:18:44.266
Silly machinery. And you know it!

01:18:45.601 --> 01:18:49.229
In 11 years, it's gonna be 1984, man.
Think about that.

01:18:50.522 --> 01:18:52.649
Want to see me feed
a mouse to my snake?

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.109
Yes.

01:18:54.318 --> 01:18:56.570
Can I have that bitchin' belt?

01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:58.447
Take it.

01:18:59.907 --> 01:19:03.744
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you, brother.

01:19:10.459 --> 01:19:13.086
We should probably get back
with the others.

01:19:13.337 --> 01:19:15.380
- Oh, it's over.
- Hey...

01:19:16.089 --> 01:19:19.551
...there's acid in the beer
that's in the red cups.

01:19:22.095 --> 01:19:23.514
That's mine.

01:19:25.682 --> 01:19:27.476
Topeka. Check it out.

01:19:27.684 --> 01:19:32.022
Please, don't give him
any more acid. Thank you.

01:19:40.697 --> 01:19:42.741
Dick? Dick, I got him.

01:19:43.534 --> 01:19:44.952
He's okay.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.954
He is on acid, though.

01:19:47.496 --> 01:19:52.334
I can't really tell.
How do you know when it's kicked in?

01:19:52.835 --> 01:19:55.921
I am a golden god!

01:19:56.922 --> 01:19:58.173
Yes, you are!

01:19:59.258 --> 01:20:02.177
I am a golden god!

01:20:02.386 --> 01:20:03.428
Hey, Russell.

01:20:04.179 --> 01:20:05.305
Don't jump.

01:20:06.974 --> 01:20:09.393
And you can tell
<i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine...

01:20:09.893 --> 01:20:12.604
...that my last words...

01:20:13.355 --> 01:20:14.398
...were:

01:20:19.194 --> 01:20:20.487
"I'm on drugs."

01:20:30.664 --> 01:20:33.417
I think we should work
on those last words!

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:35.836
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it.

01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:39.548
I got it. I got it. This is better.

01:20:39.798 --> 01:20:41.800
Last words:

01:20:43.093 --> 01:20:44.928
"I dig music."

01:20:48.223 --> 01:20:49.683
"I'm on drugs!"

01:20:54.521 --> 01:20:55.814
Just come on down...

01:20:56.023 --> 01:20:58.692
...and we'll go back to the hotel.

01:20:59.109 --> 01:21:00.194
Okay.

01:21:00.402 --> 01:21:01.820
- Jump.
- Jump!

01:21:17.711 --> 01:21:19.129
Somebody help him.

01:21:19.338 --> 01:21:21.089
I'll save you, Russell!

01:21:27.513 --> 01:21:31.767
<i>They've been crying for you</i>
<i>like a bunch of whimpering pussies.</i>

01:21:31.975 --> 01:21:33.268
<i>Oh, the band's over.</i>

01:21:33.519 --> 01:21:36.188
- This is my family now.
- That's right.

01:21:36.396 --> 01:21:38.315
- Right.
- Definitely. It's over.

01:21:38.524 --> 01:21:41.819
- He's staying with us.
- Let's just go to Greenville.

01:21:42.027 --> 01:21:45.364
We'll listen to some great music,
we'll finish the tour...

01:21:45.572 --> 01:21:48.450
...and then we'll leave
those ungrateful fools behind.

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:51.286
Then we'll come back here,
where you'll live.

01:21:51.495 --> 01:21:54.331
- That sounds good.
- He can stay in our basement.

01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:58.377
- I see what you're doing. I like it.
- Okay, good.

01:21:59.127 --> 01:22:00.295
Come on.

01:22:01.004 --> 01:22:03.632
I got it, man, I got it.

01:22:03.882 --> 01:22:05.926
That felt kind of good, though.

01:22:06.844 --> 01:22:08.720
Excuse me, kids.

01:22:09.304 --> 01:22:12.391
Look at him.
He's taking notes with his eyes.

01:22:12.599 --> 01:22:15.018
How do we know you're not a cop? Huh?

01:22:15.227 --> 01:22:18.480
The Enemy?
Stop fucking looking at me!

01:22:18.689 --> 01:22:20.482
He's your guardian angel.

01:22:20.691 --> 01:22:23.986
Don't worry.
He only means half of what he says.

01:22:24.194 --> 01:22:25.320
Which half?

01:22:25.529 --> 01:22:27.447
Just help me get my interview.

01:22:27.656 --> 01:22:30.242
- I have to go home, Dick.
- Okay, okay.

01:22:30.492 --> 01:22:32.286
- I have to go home.
- Look.

01:22:32.494 --> 01:22:35.956
You saved the tour.
That's good enough for now, okay?

01:22:36.832 --> 01:22:39.585
- Come on, big fella, let's go.
- I hurt the flower.

01:22:39.793 --> 01:22:44.298
Did you, man? You hurt the flower?
That's nice. Come on, on the bus.

01:22:50.012 --> 01:22:53.557
Ladies and gentlemen,
the evening is over!

01:22:54.099 --> 01:22:59.521
We hope you all enjoyed yourselves,
and we'll see you all again in 1974.

01:22:59.771 --> 01:23:01.398
Good evening!

01:24:51.758 --> 01:24:53.594
I have to go home.

01:24:58.390 --> 01:25:00.058
You are home.

01:25:15.324 --> 01:25:17.367
<i>In Carl Jung's opinion...</i>

01:25:17.576 --> 01:25:20.496
...we all have
a sixth sense, intuition.

01:25:20.704 --> 01:25:23.707
When you feel you can't live
without someone you just met...

01:25:23.916 --> 01:25:28.212
...this could be the memory of a past
love from the collective unconscious.

01:25:30.088 --> 01:25:31.965
Or it could just be hormones.

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:36.970
I'm sorry, I can't concentrate.

01:25:38.096 --> 01:25:41.183
Rock stars have kidnapped my son.

01:25:49.358 --> 01:25:52.611
<i>Most of the fuckups in the world...</i>

01:25:52.861 --> 01:25:55.948
<i>... come from the brain,</i>
<i>not the instincts.</i>

01:25:56.532 --> 01:25:58.951
My whole thing is to try and...

01:25:59.201 --> 01:26:02.037
My thing is to make
my brain go away.

01:26:02.287 --> 01:26:04.998
But I can't, except on stage.

01:26:05.290 --> 01:26:09.419
The brain should be a softening
influence on the instincts...

01:26:09.628 --> 01:26:12.631
...but the instincts should drive.

01:26:12.881 --> 01:26:17.719
Trying to reconcile the brain
with ancient urges.

01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:21.014
The way the brain interprets
these instincts...

01:26:21.265 --> 01:26:22.724
...is a heavy trip.

01:26:22.933 --> 01:26:26.395
Vallencourt, are you getting
on the bus or what?

01:26:28.397 --> 01:26:31.608
Come on, let's get on the bus.

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:38.782
<i>U sually I'm brain...</i>

01:26:39.283 --> 01:26:41.827
<i>... and Russell is instinct.</i>

01:26:43.912 --> 01:26:46.623
<i>But when we're both instinct...</i>

01:26:46.874 --> 01:26:50.752
<i>... that's when we make</i>
<i>the most memorable music...</i>

01:26:51.003 --> 01:26:52.754
<i>... because it's the best.</i>

01:26:57.509 --> 01:27:01.221
Show me any guy who said
he didn't want popularity...

01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:06.268
...and I'll show you a scared guy.
I've studied the history of music.

01:27:06.477 --> 01:27:09.980
Most of the time, the best stuff
is the popular stuff.

01:27:10.564 --> 01:27:13.525
It's safe to say popularity sucks.

01:27:13.775 --> 01:27:17.571
It allows you to forgive yourself
if you suck.

01:27:17.863 --> 01:27:21.450
And I don't forgive myself.
Do you?

01:27:24.036 --> 01:27:26.413
Lester, <i>Rolling Stone</i>
is calling me.

01:27:26.622 --> 01:27:28.373
I don't have my key interview.

01:27:30.042 --> 01:27:32.294
- Days are going by.
- You're flipping.

01:27:32.503 --> 01:27:34.838
That's good. All right.

01:27:35.714 --> 01:27:38.550
This is how you blow their minds.
He'll ask you...

01:27:38.759 --> 01:27:41.261
- <i>This is Ben Fong-Torres, right?</i>
- Yeah.

01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:45.057
He'll ask you how the story's going,
and this is what you do.

01:27:45.349 --> 01:27:46.725
Tell him...

01:27:47.976 --> 01:27:50.896
...you know, it's a...
It's a "think piece"...

01:27:51.522 --> 01:27:53.607
Think piece.

01:27:54.233 --> 01:27:56.652
<i>... about a mid-level band...</i>

01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:00.781
...struggling with their own
limitations in the, you know...

01:28:00.989 --> 01:28:02.282
...harsh face of stardom.

01:28:02.491 --> 01:28:04.827
Harsh face.

01:28:05.035 --> 01:28:07.162
Yeah, he'll wet himself.

01:28:12.543 --> 01:28:15.504
All dressed up and no place to go.

01:28:15.712 --> 01:28:16.922
Greenville.

01:28:17.131 --> 01:28:18.799
I'm bored.

01:28:24.888 --> 01:28:27.766
Who hid the Quaaludes from me?

01:28:28.725 --> 01:28:30.018
I have to pee.

01:28:30.936 --> 01:28:33.188
Wow! Cute.

01:28:35.357 --> 01:28:37.568
Let's deflower the kid.

01:28:45.993 --> 01:28:48.829
Whoa. Hold on, hold on.

01:28:49.037 --> 01:28:51.123
Wait. I should leave.

01:28:51.331 --> 01:28:53.876
I think things are going
backwards for me.

01:28:54.084 --> 01:28:56.670
- Backwards?
- Well, I don't know. I just...

01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:01.383
I thought maybe we could hang out.
You know, do some stuff back home...

01:29:01.592 --> 01:29:03.218
...like regular stuff.

01:29:03.427 --> 01:29:07.431
Get to know each other a little
bit better, and then I'd see you pee.

01:29:07.639 --> 01:29:11.226
I mean, you know, that's just
the way I usually do it.

01:29:11.435 --> 01:29:13.353
You're one of us.

01:29:13.729 --> 01:29:15.189
If you come to Cleveland...

01:29:15.439 --> 01:29:18.025
...Bowie will be at Swingo's,
America's greatest hotel.

01:29:18.233 --> 01:29:22.112
I'll introduce you to him,
and his security guard, Dennis.

01:29:22.321 --> 01:29:24.948
Don't you have any regular friends?

01:29:25.449 --> 01:29:28.118
Famous people are
just more interesting.

01:29:29.203 --> 01:29:32.206
Well, I would be worried
that they were using me.

01:29:34.082 --> 01:29:36.585
Boy, if this was the real world...

01:29:36.793 --> 01:29:38.754
Not that anybody's using you!

01:29:38.962 --> 01:29:40.422
No. Hold on.

01:29:43.175 --> 01:29:45.803
I'm not famous. But...

01:29:46.929 --> 01:29:49.681
- Your time has come.
- Did Russell call?

01:29:49.890 --> 01:29:51.975
- Deflower.
- Opie must die.

01:29:53.811 --> 01:29:56.647
- Pants him, girls.
- Stop. We're talking.

01:29:56.855 --> 01:29:58.482
Opie must die.

01:29:59.233 --> 01:30:03.195
- No. Okay, this isn't funny.
- No, come on!

01:30:05.864 --> 01:30:07.366
- Up!
- Please.

01:30:08.325 --> 01:30:10.619
Guys, come on. I have to write.

01:30:36.895 --> 01:30:39.231
Come on, Penny, join us.

01:30:57.791 --> 01:31:01.378
<i>Take a vacation from yourself.</i>
<i>Leave this up to professionals.</i>

01:31:01.587 --> 01:31:03.005
<i>Don't worry, William.</i>

01:31:03.213 --> 01:31:07.759
<i>I've seen the future, and this</i>
<i>all works out reasonably well.</i>

01:31:08.343 --> 01:31:09.970
<i>Reasonably?</i>

01:31:16.059 --> 01:31:17.769
Hello?

01:31:18.687 --> 01:31:22.608
Hello. This is Ben Fong-Torres
calling from <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

01:31:22.858 --> 01:31:25.277
Hi, Ben Fong-Torres
from <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

01:31:25.527 --> 01:31:27.905
<i>Hello, hello.</i>

01:31:29.948 --> 01:31:30.991
Hello, Ben.

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:36.288
<i>William Miller, this is your editor</i>
<i>at</i> Rolling Stone. <i>How's the story?</i>

01:31:36.955 --> 01:31:38.916
I'm getting good stuff out here.

01:31:39.124 --> 01:31:41.084
Yeah, it sounds like it.

01:31:42.294 --> 01:31:43.545
Man, I need some...

01:31:47.382 --> 01:31:50.427
Now, listen. Get it together, man.

01:31:50.636 --> 01:31:53.555
We're professionals.
I don't need to tell you this.

01:31:53.764 --> 01:31:57.142
<i>You're not there to party.</i>
<i>We already have Hunter Thompson.</i>

01:31:57.351 --> 01:31:59.978
<i>You're out there</i>
<i>to interview and to report.</i>

01:32:00.187 --> 01:32:02.898
Now, this isn't <i>Creem.</i>
This is <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

01:32:03.106 --> 01:32:06.360
This story is due in four days.
How is it shaping up?

01:32:11.323 --> 01:32:13.951
It's a think-piece
about a mid-level band...

01:32:14.159 --> 01:32:18.247
...struggling with their limitations
in the harsh face of stardom.

01:32:18.664 --> 01:32:19.706
That's great.

01:32:22.167 --> 01:32:26.672
I like what we're saying. Let me try
and get you 1000 more words.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.383
<i>Now, it's in consideration</i>
<i>for the cover...</i>

01:32:29.591 --> 01:32:32.010
<i>... but don't tell the band.</i>

01:32:33.053 --> 01:32:34.972
<i>The cover.</i>

01:32:35.222 --> 01:32:36.765
<i>Crazy.</i>

01:32:36.974 --> 01:32:38.475
Crazy.

01:32:39.476 --> 01:32:40.769
Some coffee.

01:32:40.978 --> 01:32:42.437
Me too.

01:32:42.938 --> 01:32:45.023
Greenville is so boring.

01:32:45.232 --> 01:32:49.820
You know, any other city in the world,
and you'd still be a virgin.

01:32:50.445 --> 01:32:53.323
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- What?

01:32:53.532 --> 01:32:57.411
I've never written anything more
than a few pages in my whole life.

01:32:57.619 --> 01:33:01.039
- Don't worry, baby, you will.
- I gotta find Russell.

01:33:01.248 --> 01:33:04.668
- I gotta find Russell.
- Oh, will you take the laundry?

01:33:06.295 --> 01:33:07.504
Take the laundry?

01:33:08.839 --> 01:33:11.550
What am I to you? Huh? Tell me.

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.343
Tell me right now.

01:33:13.552 --> 01:33:16.430
What am I to you?

01:33:26.690 --> 01:33:28.567
Excuse me, sir,
will you sign for this?

01:33:28.817 --> 01:33:31.153
Good morning.

01:33:45.417 --> 01:33:47.503
Please go the fuck away!

01:34:42.599 --> 01:34:45.644
We'll do the interview in Cleveland.

01:34:46.478 --> 01:34:49.439
No, I can't go to Cleveland.

01:34:49.690 --> 01:34:53.152
Come on, man, we'll have
more time there.

01:34:53.527 --> 01:34:54.778
Don't be tense.

01:34:57.531 --> 01:34:58.907
Come to Cleveland.

01:34:59.158 --> 01:35:00.868
- Come to Cleveland.
- Come to Cleveland.

01:35:01.118 --> 01:35:05.873
- Come to Cleveland.
- I can't go to Cleveland.

01:35:06.123 --> 01:35:08.876
Can we help it if we like
having you around?

01:35:09.126 --> 01:35:11.336
Come to Cleveland.

01:35:12.713 --> 01:35:15.674
I don't want to go to Cleveland, okay?

01:35:15.966 --> 01:35:19.011
I want to go home.

01:35:20.554 --> 01:35:22.890
I like it when you yell.

01:35:23.098 --> 01:35:27.978
I'm not gonna let you miss out
on the rock mecca of the Midwest.

01:35:28.228 --> 01:35:29.688
You're with us.

01:35:30.189 --> 01:35:34.902
- Rock'n'roll.
- Rock'n'roll.

01:35:36.361 --> 01:35:40.407
I know, I know.
"It's all happening."

01:35:54.755 --> 01:35:56.757
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hi.

01:35:58.926 --> 01:36:00.761
- It's Stillwater!
- Oh, my God!

01:36:00.969 --> 01:36:03.722
Hi, welcome to Swingo's.
You must be Stillwater.

01:36:03.931 --> 01:36:08.227
"Memory of a Free Festival,"
that's vintage Bowie.

01:36:08.477 --> 01:36:13.899
<i>Ziggy Stardust</i> is mass media.
It's hamburgers for the apocalypse.

01:36:16.819 --> 01:36:18.195
It's Bowie!

01:36:52.563 --> 01:36:55.983
Jeff and Russell are
the band's figureheads...

01:36:56.191 --> 01:36:59.403
...but the true Stillwater fan...

01:36:59.653 --> 01:37:05.075
...knows that the purity, the core of
Stillwater, comes from Ed Vallencourt.

01:37:05.659 --> 01:37:09.121
Hi, Mom. I'm gonna
fly back Monday morning.

01:37:10.455 --> 01:37:13.876
No, I'll only miss one test.
I'll make graduation.

01:37:14.084 --> 01:37:16.795
<i>Tell her you're a slave</i>
<i>to the groove.</i>

01:37:22.843 --> 01:37:26.346
Hey, Mom, it's Russell Hammond.
I play guitar in Stillwater.

01:37:26.555 --> 01:37:31.101
How does it feel to be the mother
of the best rock journalist we've met?

01:37:33.395 --> 01:37:34.646
<i>Hello?</i>

01:37:37.774 --> 01:37:40.319
You got a great kid here.
Don't worry.

01:37:40.569 --> 01:37:44.281
We're taking good care of him.
You should come to the show...

01:37:44.531 --> 01:37:46.825
...and join the circus.
- <i>Listen, mister.</i>

01:37:47.451 --> 01:37:49.995
Your charm doesn't work on me.
I'm onto you.

01:37:50.204 --> 01:37:52.080
Oh, of course you like him.

01:37:52.831 --> 01:37:54.249
Well, yeah.

01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:59.171
He worships you people. That's fine
as long as he helps make you rich.

01:37:59.755 --> 01:38:03.467
- Rich? I don't think so. We sit...
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

01:38:03.675 --> 01:38:06.762
He's a smart, goodhearted
15-year-old kid...

01:38:06.970 --> 01:38:08.347
<i>... with infinite potential.</i>

01:38:09.932 --> 01:38:12.518
<i>You're not talking</i>
<i>to some apron-wearing mom.</i>

01:38:12.726 --> 01:38:15.771
<i>I know about your decadence.</i>
<i>I shouldn't have let him go.</i>

01:38:16.313 --> 01:38:21.235
He's not ready for your world of
compromise and diminished brain cells.

01:38:21.443 --> 01:38:22.611
Am I clear?

01:38:23.111 --> 01:38:25.280
- Yes, ma'am.
- <i>lf you break his spirit...</i>

01:38:25.489 --> 01:38:27.074
<i>... harm him in any way...</i>

01:38:27.282 --> 01:38:31.119
...keep him from his chosen profession,
which is law, something I value...

01:38:32.079 --> 01:38:34.081
<i>... you'll meet this voice in person...</i>

01:38:34.289 --> 01:38:37.835
...and it will not be pretty.
Do we understand each other?

01:38:38.544 --> 01:38:40.879
- Yes, ma'am.
- <i>I didn't ask for this role...</i>

01:38:41.088 --> 01:38:42.631
...but I'll play it.

01:38:44.466 --> 01:38:46.343
Now go do your best.

01:38:46.802 --> 01:38:49.763
"Be bold, and mighty forces
will come to your aid."

01:38:49.972 --> 01:38:51.598
Goethe said that.

01:38:53.517 --> 01:38:57.104
It's not too late for you
to become a person of substance.

01:38:57.521 --> 01:39:00.357
<i>Please get my son home safely.</i>

01:39:01.191 --> 01:39:03.485
<i>You know, I'm glad we spoke.</i>

01:39:23.297 --> 01:39:25.215
- All right, boys.
- All right.

01:39:29.386 --> 01:39:31.889
Your mom kind of freaked me out.

01:39:33.515 --> 01:39:35.225
She means well.

01:39:39.062 --> 01:39:42.733
<i>From Troy, Michigan...</i>

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:47.321
<i>... would you please</i>
<i>welcome to Cleveland...</i>

01:39:48.447 --> 01:39:50.574
...Stillwater!

01:41:23.834 --> 01:41:26.795
When you play a great show
like tonight...

01:41:27.004 --> 01:41:29.298
I need everyone's attention, please.

01:41:29.506 --> 01:41:32.551
Girls, I need five minutes
with the band alone.

01:41:32.801 --> 01:41:36.722
Right. Well, it seems
the rumours are true.

01:41:37.639 --> 01:41:40.559
The record company's sent
a big-time manager here...

01:41:40.767 --> 01:41:43.437
...to try and talk you
into replacing me.

01:41:43.645 --> 01:41:46.064
It's Dennis Hope.
You've all heard of him.

01:41:46.273 --> 01:41:49.860
He has all the big bands,
and he wants five minutes with you.

01:41:51.195 --> 01:41:53.363
Well, I think we've gotta do this.

01:41:55.741 --> 01:41:57.159
- Send him in.
- Bring him in.

01:41:57.367 --> 01:42:00.579
- We'll send him out on a rail!
- All right.

01:42:00.829 --> 01:42:05.000
We'll do the interview in Maryland.
You can fly home from there.

01:42:09.463 --> 01:42:12.174
We got a manager
who's been with us all along.

01:42:12.382 --> 01:42:14.510
Respectfully. We all have our roots.

01:42:14.718 --> 01:42:16.804
Bands should hold on to their roots.

01:42:17.137 --> 01:42:19.807
Those roots need to be augmented.

01:42:20.015 --> 01:42:22.976
I'll tell you the truth.
I may enrage some...

01:42:23.811 --> 01:42:27.356
...and enthral others.
I don't give a fuck.

01:42:27.564 --> 01:42:30.734
Your manager here
needs a manager.

01:42:30.943 --> 01:42:34.071
Example: If you hadn't
run out in Phoenix...

01:42:34.279 --> 01:42:36.657
...we could have sued
over Russell's hand.

01:42:36.865 --> 01:42:40.410
But you left, negating the contract,
forfeiting the deposit.

01:42:40.619 --> 01:42:45.332
You travelled a long way to pay
that promoter to electrocute you.

01:42:45.541 --> 01:42:47.918
Your damages have put you in the hole.

01:42:48.127 --> 01:42:50.754
You owe the record company
more than you got.

01:42:51.046 --> 01:42:53.006
But there's money to be made.

01:42:53.215 --> 01:42:56.468
I brought a plane.
More shows to make up the difference.

01:42:56.677 --> 01:42:59.221
- Respectfully.
- We travel by bus.

01:42:59.471 --> 01:43:02.099
Doris is the soul of this band.

01:43:02.307 --> 01:43:05.853
That bus has been our home
since we were the Jeff Bebe band.

01:43:06.061 --> 01:43:09.148
I'd travel on a pogo stick
to make more money.

01:43:09.356 --> 01:43:10.941
You could play more dates.

01:43:11.150 --> 01:43:14.987
It's not about money. It's about
the music and turning people on.

01:43:15.195 --> 01:43:16.572
Clearly. Respectfully.

01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:19.449
But on the distasteful
subject of money...

01:43:19.658 --> 01:43:23.871
...just know that you're all
making it, right now...

01:43:24.288 --> 01:43:26.165
...and it's all out there.

01:43:26.415 --> 01:43:30.043
I'm just talking about
bringing it back here.

01:43:31.086 --> 01:43:33.797
Why pay for something we can do?

01:43:34.006 --> 01:43:38.260
You know how not to get charged
for the ice below Chicago Stadium?

01:43:39.178 --> 01:43:40.929
You know how to do a headlining tour?

01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:46.393
Do you know Claire Rothman in L.A?
Know Bobby Cowan, Danny Marcus...

01:43:46.602 --> 01:43:48.479
...Lisa Robinson?

01:43:48.729 --> 01:43:50.564
Know Frank Barcelona?

01:43:51.190 --> 01:43:54.568
This is Cleveland!
Where's Kid Leo? Where is he?

01:43:54.776 --> 01:43:57.863
You know how to get a record
not pressed, but played?

01:43:58.113 --> 01:44:02.576
I didn't invent the rainy day, man.
I just own the best umbrella.

01:44:02.784 --> 01:44:06.622
You may believe this will
last forever. It does not.

01:44:06.872 --> 01:44:10.667
Your biggest fan right now...
Your biggest fan...

01:44:10.876 --> 01:44:16.298
...is gonna go to college, buy
clothes, spend that money elsewhere.

01:44:17.591 --> 01:44:22.387
And you know what? They'll tape
your record from a friend.

01:44:22.679 --> 01:44:26.391
You gotta take what you can,
when you can, while you can...

01:44:26.642 --> 01:44:28.393
...and you gotta do it now.

01:44:28.602 --> 01:44:30.187
That's what the big boys do.

01:44:30.395 --> 01:44:32.564
If you think Mick Jagger'll
still be there...

01:44:32.815 --> 01:44:37.236
...trying to be a rock star at age 50,
you're sadly mistaken.

01:44:38.362 --> 01:44:40.989
Well, thank you, Dennis.

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:45.285
- We'll think about what you said.
- Oh, no...

01:44:46.286 --> 01:44:50.290
...l'll think about it.
I'm not auditioning.

01:44:50.499 --> 01:44:54.336
I came here to decide
if I want to represent you.

01:44:54.545 --> 01:44:59.967
So I'll stand outside and think
about whether I wanna stay.

01:45:01.635 --> 01:45:03.387
It was a good show.

01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:17.609
I miss him already.

01:45:18.652 --> 01:45:22.656
<i>You're coming along at a very</i>
<i>dangerous time for rock'n'roll.</i>

01:45:22.865 --> 01:45:25.033
<i>The war is over. They won.</i>

01:45:25.284 --> 01:45:27.244
<i>They will ruin rock'n'roll...</i>

01:45:27.452 --> 01:45:31.165
<i>... and strangle everything</i>
<i>we love about it.</i>

01:46:51.286 --> 01:46:54.206
- Put them up.
- I don't know what that was.

01:46:54.414 --> 01:46:56.708
Donkey dick, man!

01:46:56.959 --> 01:46:59.920
A donkey dick is funny everywhere.

01:47:02.256 --> 01:47:03.590
Is Russell here?

01:47:03.841 --> 01:47:06.969
Hey, the Enemy! Come on in, son.

01:47:09.471 --> 01:47:12.015
Welcome to the road manager
poker party.

01:47:12.266 --> 01:47:16.145
This game's been going on for
two years. Come on, find a spot.

01:47:16.854 --> 01:47:18.939
- Mick's with The Who.
- How you doing?

01:47:19.148 --> 01:47:22.484
Raymond's with the Eagles.
Reg is with Humble Pie.

01:47:22.693 --> 01:47:24.903
- I think you know Red Dog.
- Hey, brother!

01:47:25.112 --> 01:47:27.614
We developed this system
of poker over time...

01:47:27.823 --> 01:47:30.701
...to play in any condition,
which helps.

01:47:30.951 --> 01:47:33.704
We let Russell in because
he brought hash.

01:47:33.912 --> 01:47:37.749
- The press is here.
- Don't mention me, or The Eagles.

01:47:38.834 --> 01:47:41.128
- I'm done.
- I'm out.

01:47:42.379 --> 01:47:44.256
- I'm in.
- All right.

01:47:44.465 --> 01:47:49.678
Side proposition to the winner:
For 50 bucks and a case of Heineken...

01:47:49.887 --> 01:47:51.805
...l'll throw in three ladies...

01:47:52.055 --> 01:47:54.933
...including Miss Penny Lane
and the famous Band Aids...

01:47:55.142 --> 01:47:58.896
...who have to leave the tour
before New York.

01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:02.608
- Okay with you?
- Russ is getting soft.

01:48:04.776 --> 01:48:07.529
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

01:48:07.779 --> 01:48:09.156
It's a deal.

01:48:09.448 --> 01:48:10.824
Show them.

01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:14.495
Three lovely ladies
in the custody of Humble Pie.

01:48:14.786 --> 01:48:19.041
- Be good to them, Reg.
- We owe you $50 and a case of Heineken.

01:48:19.249 --> 01:48:20.375
All right.

01:48:21.084 --> 01:48:23.837
- Joint?
- Know how I know this is good stuff?

01:48:24.046 --> 01:48:25.339
- How?
- It's from Crosby.

01:48:25.547 --> 01:48:28.008
- Is that the Crosby weed?
- It's from Crosby.

01:48:28.217 --> 01:48:31.261
- Oh, I'm in.
- I'm in.

01:48:33.305 --> 01:48:35.057
Give me a light. I want fire.

01:48:35.265 --> 01:48:38.644
Look, nobody's feelings
are getting hurt here.

01:48:38.852 --> 01:48:42.940
She knows Leslie's coming to New York
tomorrow. Everyone understands.

01:48:43.315 --> 01:48:46.276
It's the circus.
Everyone's trying not to go home.

01:48:46.693 --> 01:48:48.779
Nobody's saying goodbye.

01:48:51.365 --> 01:48:54.535
Quit looking at me like that.

01:49:31.530 --> 01:49:33.282
I'm making a wish.

01:49:42.124 --> 01:49:43.709
So...

01:49:44.626 --> 01:49:47.671
<i>Penny, our friend</i>
<i>Has gained another year</i>

01:49:47.921 --> 01:49:50.591
<i>But long ago she threw it in gear</i>

01:49:50.841 --> 01:49:55.471
<i>She rocked the south</i>
<i>The east, the west</i>

01:49:56.180 --> 01:49:57.890
<i>Could we get off this tour</i>

01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:00.726
<i>As Black Sabbath's special guests</i>

01:50:02.978 --> 01:50:07.566
<i>She says she's retired</i>
<i>But we've heard that before</i>

01:50:07.774 --> 01:50:12.529
<i>She chose us</i>
<i>In Penny Lane we trust</i>

01:50:12.779 --> 01:50:16.241
<i>She is a fan of this band</i>

01:50:17.367 --> 01:50:19.578
<i>Much more so than us</i>

01:50:47.397 --> 01:50:49.191
Thank you, baby.

01:50:55.656 --> 01:50:58.075
Who wants the "P" in Penny?

01:50:58.450 --> 01:51:00.744
Happy birthday.

01:51:00.994 --> 01:51:03.997
- Thank you.
- Sorry the plane isn't bigger.

01:51:06.667 --> 01:51:08.544
I'll take a piece.

01:51:35.362 --> 01:51:37.573
Who didn't get cake?

01:51:47.666 --> 01:51:50.085
Any extra plates?

01:51:51.253 --> 01:51:52.546
Anybody?

01:51:55.174 --> 01:51:57.217
<i>You think you can fool me.</i>

01:51:57.593 --> 01:52:00.679
I can read you.
I know what you're thinking.

01:52:01.638 --> 01:52:05.726
- What's that?
- You're worried about me and Russell.

01:52:08.729 --> 01:52:11.148
Yeah, I gotta work on that.

01:52:11.648 --> 01:52:13.442
You're so sweet.

01:52:14.067 --> 01:52:17.821
God, if there was more of you in him.

01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:21.825
Don't tell me this stuff.
I want to like him.

01:52:24.953 --> 01:52:26.997
Did you miss a test or something?

01:52:28.415 --> 01:52:32.419
- You have no idea.
- I know I'm not on the plane.

01:52:32.628 --> 01:52:34.338
I won't go with another band.

01:52:34.546 --> 01:52:37.382
I could go with the crew,
but that'd be pathetic...

01:52:37.591 --> 01:52:40.135
...and the girls are all
going with Humble Pie.

01:52:40.552 --> 01:52:44.097
So if you could find out
from Russell...

01:52:44.598 --> 01:52:47.976
Forget it, I'll fly myself.
I have lots of partial tickets.

01:52:48.185 --> 01:52:51.063
I know his ex-wife-
current-girlfriend thing will be...

01:52:51.271 --> 01:52:52.898
That's not a good idea.

01:52:53.106 --> 01:52:56.735
What are you saying?
Did Russell say something?

01:52:58.237 --> 01:53:01.323
- I don't know anything.
- I know he wants me there.

01:53:01.782 --> 01:53:03.617
Wake up!

01:53:03.909 --> 01:53:05.327
Don't go to New York.

01:53:06.245 --> 01:53:09.456
- Why are you yelling?
- I thought we were going to Morocco.

01:53:09.665 --> 01:53:12.668
There is no Morocco.
There's never been a Morocco.

01:53:12.876 --> 01:53:15.212
There's not even a Penny Lane.

01:53:15.546 --> 01:53:17.881
I don't even know your real name.

01:53:18.632 --> 01:53:22.344
If I met a man in the real world
who looked at me the way you...

01:53:22.553 --> 01:53:26.306
When and where
does this "real world" occur?

01:53:26.515 --> 01:53:30.519
I mean, I am really confused here.
All these rules...

01:53:30.727 --> 01:53:32.855
...and all these sayings
and nicknames.

01:53:33.063 --> 01:53:37.192
Honey, you're too sweet
for rock'n'roll.

01:53:37.651 --> 01:53:39.278
Sweet?

01:53:39.945 --> 01:53:41.738
Where do you get off?

01:53:41.947 --> 01:53:43.532
Where do you get "sweet"?

01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:46.326
I am dark and mysterious
and pissed off!

01:53:46.535 --> 01:53:49.204
And I could be very dangerous
to all of you.

01:53:49.413 --> 01:53:51.415
I am not sweet.

01:53:51.623 --> 01:53:55.752
And you should know that about me.
I am the Enemy!

01:53:55.961 --> 01:53:57.838
You should be happy for me.

01:53:58.046 --> 01:54:00.716
You don't know
what he says to me in private.

01:54:00.924 --> 01:54:04.052
Maybe it is love,
as much as it can be for somebody...

01:54:04.261 --> 01:54:07.890
Who sold you to Humble Pie
for 50 bucks and a case of beer?

01:54:08.932 --> 01:54:10.559
I was there.

01:54:11.351 --> 01:54:13.270
I was there!

01:54:20.027 --> 01:54:21.195
Oh, God.

01:54:26.492 --> 01:54:28.368
I'm sorry.

01:54:41.381 --> 01:54:43.509
What kind of beer?

01:55:00.734 --> 01:55:03.070
<i>Welcome to New York!</i>
<i>You can be nervous.</i>

01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:08.450
You should be. Just be yourself and
leave a pint of blood on the stage.

01:55:08.659 --> 01:55:09.868
Hey, William.

01:55:10.077 --> 01:55:13.247
We showed you America.
We did everything but get you laid.

01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:27.928
No. Yeah?

01:55:47.281 --> 01:55:50.951
I'm from the Church of Lenny.
We bow to his will.

01:55:51.201 --> 01:55:53.704
He is the king of kings.

01:55:53.954 --> 01:55:56.915
- Can I get an autograph?
- Made out to who?

01:55:57.124 --> 01:55:59.084
- She's here.
- To Lenny.

01:56:03.505 --> 01:56:05.716
- Can I have your autograph?
- Yeah.

01:56:06.842 --> 01:56:07.885
Leslie!

01:56:11.138 --> 01:56:13.724
Room's fully stocked.
Air conditioning's on.

01:56:13.974 --> 01:56:16.310
- You look stunning.
- Thanks. See you later.

01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:18.520
All right, bags in five!

01:56:18.896 --> 01:56:21.106
Cars leave for the party at 6.

01:56:21.565 --> 01:56:23.275
Oh, God.

01:56:27.321 --> 01:56:30.407
There are lighter souvenirs,
you know.

01:56:30.657 --> 01:56:34.578
I kept thinking I was gonna
go home the next day.

01:56:34.828 --> 01:56:37.372
So did I, 15 years ago.

01:56:37.998 --> 01:56:40.584
That's the wrong bag, you idiot!

01:56:40.793 --> 01:56:42.044
William?

01:56:42.377 --> 01:56:43.420
Vic!

01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:46.673
It's all happening.
They're here.

01:56:46.882 --> 01:56:50.677
Zeppelin are here. They are here.
They're at the Plaza.

01:56:50.928 --> 01:56:55.599
Sapphire and Miss Penny Lane
are there too.

01:56:55.849 --> 01:56:59.478
They're all staying under the name
"Emily Rugburn."

01:56:59.978 --> 01:57:03.065
- Wait. Penny Lane is here?
- Emily Rugburn.

01:57:03.732 --> 01:57:04.775
William Miller?

01:57:05.234 --> 01:57:07.194
Sir, you have an urgent call.

01:57:09.321 --> 01:57:10.364
Hello?

01:57:10.572 --> 01:57:13.408
This is Jann Wenner,
publisher of <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

01:57:13.659 --> 01:57:15.410
Congratulations, it's a cover.

01:57:16.245 --> 01:57:18.122
<i>Leibovitz will shoot them in L.A...</i>

01:57:18.372 --> 01:57:20.290
...but we need you
in San Francisco...

01:57:20.541 --> 01:57:24.044
<i>... tomorrow. You can finish</i>
<i>the story here. Talk to Ben.</i>

01:57:24.711 --> 01:57:28.006
You can tell the band. Alison, our
fact-checker, needs you...

01:57:28.257 --> 01:57:31.426
<i>... to transmit whatever you have</i>
<i>of the story tonight.</i>

01:57:31.718 --> 01:57:34.096
There's a mojo at the <i>Daily News</i>
you can use.

01:57:34.429 --> 01:57:35.472
A mojo?

01:57:35.722 --> 01:57:40.477
A mojo. It's a modern machine that
transmits pages over the telephone.

01:57:40.727 --> 01:57:43.272
It only takes 18 minutes a page.

01:57:44.731 --> 01:57:47.526
As soon as people leave,
I'll fit you in.

01:57:47.734 --> 01:57:50.863
- Excuse me. Got an I. D?
- No.

01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:53.157
Hey, man, he's cool.

01:57:53.365 --> 01:57:56.201
- Dennis, how's it going?
- Great.

01:57:56.452 --> 01:57:58.120
Well, enjoy.

01:58:14.303 --> 01:58:15.888
Opie.

01:58:16.305 --> 01:58:19.933
I'm going to England with Deep Purple
in an hour.

01:58:22.769 --> 01:58:24.855
Don't forget me, okay?

01:58:27.441 --> 01:58:31.069
It's all happening.
I must vamoosh.

01:58:51.423 --> 01:58:52.883
Hey, the Enemy.

01:58:53.133 --> 01:58:57.387
We got a table back there.
They're all looking for you.

01:59:01.433 --> 01:59:02.476
Guys.

01:59:04.269 --> 01:59:05.813
Guys!

01:59:08.899 --> 01:59:11.860
You're gonna be on the cover
of <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

01:59:14.822 --> 01:59:16.573
Are you serious?

01:59:17.074 --> 01:59:19.785
The cover of <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

01:59:20.786 --> 01:59:22.538
And we made it together.

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:26.375
And they don't just put somebody...

01:59:26.625 --> 01:59:30.587
...with one little hit on
the cover of <i>Rolling Stone...</i>

01:59:30.963 --> 01:59:33.590
...fucking magazine, man!

01:59:33.841 --> 01:59:36.093
Damn it, I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:59:36.301 --> 01:59:38.762
When I first bought the magazine...

01:59:39.012 --> 01:59:41.431
...The Beatles were on the cover.

01:59:41.682 --> 01:59:42.724
The Beatles.

01:59:42.933 --> 01:59:46.145
Four of them, four of us.

02:00:16.383 --> 02:00:17.634
Thank you!

02:00:20.721 --> 02:00:22.181
Who is that girl?

02:00:22.431 --> 02:00:24.349
She's creeping me out.

02:00:24.683 --> 02:00:26.268
She's not with any of you, is she?

02:00:26.518 --> 02:00:28.270
Yeah, she's with me.

02:00:38.864 --> 02:00:41.074
So, who's gonna shoot it?

02:00:42.701 --> 02:00:44.620
I want Annie Leibovitz.

02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:47.122
I love Annie's stuff.
She does great stuff.

02:02:28.599 --> 02:02:31.727
I am no good at goodbyes.

02:02:33.061 --> 02:02:34.104
And you...

02:02:34.938 --> 02:02:36.982
...are the last...

02:02:37.232 --> 02:02:41.528
...of my old-time friends.

02:02:43.238 --> 02:02:45.073
Polexia...

02:02:45.282 --> 02:02:48.827
Polexia went to England
with Deep Purple.

02:02:49.286 --> 02:02:51.330
Can you believe that?

02:02:51.622 --> 02:02:54.500
Even Sapphire went someplace else.

02:02:54.750 --> 02:02:57.836
All she left was her Quaaludes.

02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:01.507
Oh, wonderful.

02:03:02.174 --> 02:03:03.675
Where's Beth?

02:03:03.884 --> 02:03:08.263
Where's my friends?
Where are all my friends?

02:03:08.514 --> 02:03:12.184
Front desk?
Could you please send a doctor?

02:03:12.893 --> 02:03:14.353
Room 537.

02:03:14.603 --> 02:03:16.188
Penny, get up!

02:03:16.772 --> 02:03:17.815
I'm up.

02:03:18.524 --> 02:03:22.236
My wife's had an accident
with some Quaaludes.

02:03:22.486 --> 02:03:26.198
- So tired.
- You gotta get up, Penny.

02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:29.201
Penny, get up. Get up.

02:03:29.451 --> 02:03:32.871
You know that.
You know that I'm retired.

02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:39.795
I've always been.
I'm retired, and I'm tired.

02:03:40.045 --> 02:03:43.924
- Jane Abbott.
- Miss Jane Abbott.

02:03:50.013 --> 02:03:52.224
Miss Judy Stanton.

02:03:57.062 --> 02:04:00.983
- Raymond Sanchez.
- Mr. Raymond Sanchez.

02:04:02.276 --> 02:04:03.527
<i>Seats and tray tables.</i>

02:04:03.777 --> 02:04:07.364
Seat back and tables locked.

02:04:07.614 --> 02:04:08.991
<i>And our pending graduate...</i>

02:04:09.825 --> 02:04:12.953
...William Miller, not present.

02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:23.297
Why doesn't he love me?

02:04:33.223 --> 02:04:36.018
<i>And to the class of 1973...</i>

02:04:36.226 --> 02:04:41.607
<i>... we say, don't forget to remember</i>
<i>yourselves as you are today:</i>

02:04:41.857 --> 02:04:46.904
Full of hope, and the dream that
everything is possible.

02:04:47.154 --> 02:04:49.948
And remember this,
20 years from now...

02:04:50.199 --> 02:04:52.659
...when we all own home computers...

02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:55.913
...and we all travel
in electrical cars...

02:04:56.163 --> 02:04:59.416
...that move swiftly,
high above our city...

02:04:59.666 --> 02:05:04.421
...that the key to the future,
is keeping today alive...

02:05:04.671 --> 02:05:06.089
...forever!

02:05:06.799 --> 02:05:09.009
Forever! Forever!

02:05:09.218 --> 02:05:12.596
Penny, no! Wake up!

02:05:16.308 --> 02:05:17.351
Well...

02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:20.604
...now that I have your attention...

02:05:22.064 --> 02:05:26.276
...I know you've heard this before,
and I've never said this to anybody.

02:05:27.110 --> 02:05:31.240
Nobody who didn't legally
have to say it back to me.

02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:32.950
But...

02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:35.869
Oh, God, why am I so nervous?

02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:38.163
You'll never remember this.

02:05:39.123 --> 02:05:40.457
I love you.

02:05:41.875 --> 02:05:45.212
And I'm about to boldly go where...

02:05:46.338 --> 02:05:49.174
...many men have gone before.

02:05:58.600 --> 02:05:59.768
Who do we got here?

02:05:59.977 --> 02:06:01.186
- What's her name?
- Emily.

02:06:01.436 --> 02:06:03.272
Okay, sweetheart,
sit up, sit up, sit up.

02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:05.983
- Good girl. What'd you take?
- I'll get her legs.

02:06:06.191 --> 02:06:07.693
- What did you take?
- Okay.

02:06:07.943 --> 02:06:10.112
- What did you take?
- I don't know.

02:06:10.362 --> 02:06:12.656
Yes, you do.
Tell us what you took.

02:06:13.532 --> 02:06:15.826
Emily, we have
to pump your stomach, okay?

02:06:16.076 --> 02:06:20.873
- Emily, wake up.
- Got the tubes. Here we go. Water.

02:06:21.123 --> 02:06:23.542
All right, you'll
have to swallow this tube.

02:06:23.792 --> 02:06:26.044
All right? Open, open, open.

02:06:26.295 --> 02:06:28.922
- Come on.
- Don't fight us, we're trying to help.

02:06:29.173 --> 02:06:32.426
- Relax.
- Come on, swallow. Swallow.

02:06:32.634 --> 02:06:33.719
I know. I know.

02:06:33.969 --> 02:06:36.096
Swallow this now.
No, don't bite on it.

02:06:36.346 --> 02:06:38.432
Swallow. Emily, come on, swallow.

02:06:38.682 --> 02:06:41.268
- Just relax. Got it.
- Very good.

02:06:41.518 --> 02:06:43.479
There we go.
All done. All done.

02:06:47.107 --> 02:06:49.735
Feed some liquid into your stomach.

02:07:20.182 --> 02:07:22.559
<i>You never did half</i>
<i>of what you said.</i>

02:07:24.019 --> 02:07:27.064
It was in the middle of
"Midnight Rambler."

02:07:27.314 --> 02:07:31.068
Keith Richards saw me...

02:07:31.318 --> 02:07:35.614
...and came to the front
of the stage. He pulled me out...

02:07:35.864 --> 02:07:38.826
...and he took me backstage...

02:07:39.076 --> 02:07:42.830
...and gave me a Coke, ice...

02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:45.207
...and a lemon.

02:07:46.250 --> 02:07:48.961
And I never went home.

02:07:49.586 --> 02:07:53.173
I've done twice the things
I said I did.

02:07:54.299 --> 02:07:56.301
What about your mom?

02:07:58.971 --> 02:08:01.723
She always said, "Marry up.

02:08:01.932 --> 02:08:04.601
Marry someone grand."

02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:07.563
And that's why she named me "Lady."

02:08:09.731 --> 02:08:12.151
She named you "Lady"?

02:08:13.277 --> 02:08:15.112
Lady Goodman.

02:08:16.947 --> 02:08:18.657
Lady Goodman.

02:08:18.991 --> 02:08:20.325
That's great.

02:08:20.534 --> 02:08:22.619
Now you know all my secrets.

02:08:23.078 --> 02:08:24.705
You've got me.

02:08:27.749 --> 02:08:29.626
See you back in the real world.

02:08:30.919 --> 02:08:32.379
Thank you...

02:08:33.297 --> 02:08:35.132
...William Miller.

02:09:05.788 --> 02:09:07.998
Hey, Lady!

02:09:11.293 --> 02:09:14.880
<i>Welcome to Eastern Airlines</i>
<i>nonstop...</i>

02:09:15.130 --> 02:09:16.673
<i>... to San Diego.</i>

02:09:16.924 --> 02:09:19.176
<i>In preparation</i>
<i>for our departure today...</i>

02:09:19.426 --> 02:09:23.555
<i>... we'd like to ask, please, that</i>
<i>you extinguish all flammable items...</i>

02:09:23.806 --> 02:09:26.475
<i>... and return all seats</i>
<i>and tray tables to their full...</i>

02:09:33.649 --> 02:09:36.068
- <i>that your seat belts</i>
<i>are securely fastened.</i>

02:09:36.318 --> 02:09:39.947
<i>And do make note</i>
<i>of the emergency exits.</i>

02:10:36.545 --> 02:10:39.715
<i>Why didn't you come to the party?</i>
<i>Bob Dylan came.</i>

02:10:39.965 --> 02:10:42.593
He was at our table for
an hour or so, right?

02:10:42.843 --> 02:10:44.052
- Yeah.
- Just rapping.

02:10:44.344 --> 02:10:48.891
Bob Dylan at our fucking table. I was
looking for you to introduce you.

02:10:49.141 --> 02:10:51.143
What happened to you last night?

02:10:51.393 --> 02:10:53.187
It's a long story.

02:11:03.906 --> 02:11:05.741
<i>Hi, this is Craig, your pilot.</i>

02:11:05.991 --> 02:11:08.076
<i>We've caught the edge of</i>
<i>an electrical storm.</i>

02:11:08.285 --> 02:11:09.328
Oh, my God.

02:11:09.536 --> 02:11:11.580
- Electrical storm?
- <i>Buckle up tight.</i>

02:11:12.289 --> 02:11:15.042
- Rock and roll.
- We shouldn't be here.

02:11:16.251 --> 02:11:18.629
- My God!
- Whoa, baby!

02:11:22.466 --> 02:11:24.009
<i>Doris, we miss you!</i>

02:11:26.678 --> 02:11:30.015
All right, listen.
We're gonna try and land in Tupelo.

02:11:30.265 --> 02:11:32.976
- We found a field to land in.
- A field?

02:11:33.227 --> 02:11:34.436
I can't breathe, man.

02:11:34.686 --> 02:11:37.523
It'll be a rough set-down,
but we should be fine.

02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:40.692
Just hang in there,
and we'll get you out of this.

02:11:45.656 --> 02:11:48.784
Everyone says
it's so glamorous out here.

02:11:49.034 --> 02:11:51.662
He just said we're gonna die.

02:11:57.167 --> 02:11:58.210
Oh, my God!

02:12:00.838 --> 02:12:05.300
If something should happen...
Maybe I never said this enough.

02:12:06.885 --> 02:12:08.137
I love all of you.

02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:18.814
I once hit a man in Dearborn,
Michigan. A hit-and-run.

02:12:19.064 --> 02:12:23.819
I hit him and just kept on going.
I don't know if he's alive or dead...

02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:25.487
...but I'm sorry.

02:12:25.737 --> 02:12:28.407
Not a day goes by
I don't see his face.

02:12:28.615 --> 02:12:31.201
Oh, my God!

02:12:31.952 --> 02:12:35.205
Look, I love you all too.
You're like family to me!

02:12:35.456 --> 02:12:37.082
Especially since Marna left me.

02:12:37.332 --> 02:12:41.086
I want you to know, if I took
an extra dollar here and there...

02:12:41.336 --> 02:12:43.338
...it's because I knew I'd earned it.

02:12:43.547 --> 02:12:45.924
- I slept with Marna, Dick.
- I did too.

02:12:46.925 --> 02:12:49.720
I waited until you broke up with her,
but me too.

02:12:52.306 --> 02:12:55.225
I also slept with Leslie,
when you were fighting.

02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:58.896
- You slept with Jeff?
- Yeah, but it didn't count.

02:12:59.146 --> 02:13:01.732
It was the summer we were
free of all rules.

02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:06.612
- And you say you love me!
- I don't love you, man. I never did.

02:13:07.279 --> 02:13:08.906
None of us love you.

02:13:09.156 --> 02:13:13.327
- You act above us. You always have.
- Finally, the truth.

02:13:13.577 --> 02:13:16.371
You just held it over us,
like you might leave.

02:13:16.622 --> 02:13:20.334
Like we're lucky to be with you.
And we had to live with it, man.

02:13:20.918 --> 02:13:22.419
I had to live with you...

02:13:22.669 --> 02:13:26.298
...and now I might die with you,
and it's not fucking fair!

02:13:26.507 --> 02:13:27.674
Please, enough!

02:13:31.887 --> 02:13:33.639
I'm still in love with you, Leslie.

02:13:33.889 --> 02:13:36.558
I don't want to hear any more.
Shut up, Jeffrey!

02:13:37.726 --> 02:13:39.061
- It's all happening.
- What the fuck!

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:43.315
- Whatever happens, you're dead!
- Don't be self-righteous.

02:13:43.565 --> 02:13:44.817
Not now, man.

02:13:45.067 --> 02:13:48.320
You were sleeping with Penny,
that fucking groupie...

02:13:48.570 --> 02:13:50.114
...last summer up until yesterday.

02:13:50.364 --> 02:13:51.782
Tell Leslie that!

02:13:52.032 --> 02:13:53.450
- Shut up!
- I quit!

02:13:53.617 --> 02:13:56.203
- I'm gonna kill you!
- I quit!

02:13:56.411 --> 02:13:57.955
"That groupie"?!

02:13:58.705 --> 02:14:02.584
She was a Band Aid.
All she did was love your band.

02:14:03.168 --> 02:14:04.628
And you all used her.

02:14:04.878 --> 02:14:08.090
All of you.
You used her and threw her away!

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:12.344
She almost died last night
while you were with Bob Dylan.

02:14:12.594 --> 02:14:16.265
You're always talking
about the fans, the fans, the fans.

02:14:16.515 --> 02:14:20.602
She was your biggest fan,
and you threw her away!

02:14:20.853 --> 02:14:25.190
And if you can't see that,
that's your biggest problem.

02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:27.734
And I love her! I love her!

02:14:37.411 --> 02:14:38.954
Fuck it!

02:14:39.955 --> 02:14:42.791
I'm... I'm gay!

02:14:57.389 --> 02:15:01.226
Thank God, we're alive!
We're alive! We're gonna make it!

02:16:14.258 --> 02:16:15.843
Write what you want.

02:16:51.210 --> 02:16:53.629
Leave your package on the desk.

02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:57.175
I'm not a messenger,
I'm one of your writers...

02:16:57.384 --> 02:16:59.511
...William H. Miller.

02:17:06.852 --> 02:17:08.853
He's just a kid.

02:17:12.232 --> 02:17:14.026
Go right on in.

02:17:38.174 --> 02:17:40.093
You're William Miller?

02:17:41.969 --> 02:17:46.308
- Yep.
- Oh, baby.

02:17:46.558 --> 02:17:50.395
Did anything happen?
After $600 in room-service bills?

02:17:50.646 --> 02:17:52.439
Did you tape Hammond?

02:17:52.689 --> 02:17:54.941
Where were you?
What did you want to write?

02:17:55.191 --> 02:17:56.860
This reads like their version.

02:17:57.111 --> 02:17:58.821
You obviously saw more
than you wrote about.

02:17:59.071 --> 02:18:02.156
- Something must've happened.
- Push up Flippo's Who cover.

02:18:02.406 --> 02:18:05.119
Good. It'll take me three
days to do this.

02:18:05.369 --> 02:18:06.870
It's all handwritten...

02:18:07.079 --> 02:18:08.789
...on little bits of paper.

02:18:08.996 --> 02:18:11.625
- It's a puff piece.
- They call women "chicks."

02:18:11.875 --> 02:18:14.920
- I have a problem with that.
- You want them to like you.

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:19.258
Ben, you told me to send what I had!

02:18:19.508 --> 02:18:22.718
It's not finished.
Give me tonight to work on it.

02:18:57.004 --> 02:18:58.922
<i>Oh, man.</i>

02:18:59.798 --> 02:19:01.341
<i>You made friends with them.</i>

02:19:02.843 --> 02:19:05.429
See, friendship is the booze
they feed you...

02:19:06.013 --> 02:19:08.764
...to get you drunk
and feel like you belong.

02:19:09.016 --> 02:19:11.643
<i>Well, it was fun.</i>

02:19:12.019 --> 02:19:14.188
Because they make you feel cool.

02:19:15.063 --> 02:19:20.110
- Hey, I met you. You are not cool.
- <i>I know.</i>

02:19:21.278 --> 02:19:23.614
Even when I thought I was,
I knew I wasn't.

02:19:23.864 --> 02:19:26.241
Because we are uncool.

02:19:27.159 --> 02:19:30.829
While women will always be
a problem for guys like us...

02:19:31.079 --> 02:19:34.583
...most of the great art in the world
is about that very problem.

02:19:35.584 --> 02:19:38.545
Good-looking people,
they got no spine.

02:19:39.213 --> 02:19:41.673
Their art never lasts.

02:19:42.299 --> 02:19:44.425
They get the girls, but we're smarter.

02:19:46.428 --> 02:19:50.516
- Yeah, I can really see that now.
- <i>Because great art is about...</i>

02:19:50.766 --> 02:19:53.811
...guilt and longing...

02:19:54.061 --> 02:19:57.689
...and love disguised as sex,
and sex disguised as love.

02:19:57.940 --> 02:20:02.111
<i>Hey, let's face it,</i>
<i>you got a big head start.</i>

02:20:02.319 --> 02:20:03.570
I'm glad you were home.

02:20:03.821 --> 02:20:06.532
I'm always home. I'm uncool.

02:20:07.199 --> 02:20:09.868
- Me too.
- <i>You're doing great, you know?</i>

02:20:10.494 --> 02:20:12.871
The only true currency in
this bankrupt world...

02:20:13.122 --> 02:20:16.333
...is what you share with someone else
when you're uncool.

02:20:17.543 --> 02:20:19.711
<i>Listen, my advice to you...</i>

02:20:19.962 --> 02:20:22.548
<i>... I know you think</i>
<i>these guys are your friends...</i>

02:20:23.423 --> 02:20:27.594
...if you want to be a true friend to
them, be honest...

02:20:27.845 --> 02:20:30.472
...and unmerciful.

02:20:31.765 --> 02:20:36.520
"I'm flying over Tupelo, Mississippi,
with America's hottest band...

02:20:36.770 --> 02:20:39.356
...and we're all about to die."

02:20:40.274 --> 02:20:43.485
- Dark, lively.
- Yeah, yeah, and it gets better.

02:20:43.694 --> 02:20:47.990
- Did this all really happen?
- I'll check the quotes.

02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:54.830
I just got off the phone
with <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

02:20:55.038 --> 02:20:58.500
- Me too. What's he using?
- He's using it all.

02:20:58.709 --> 02:21:00.544
This according to the fact checker.

02:21:00.752 --> 02:21:03.338
- So what.
- "So what"?

02:21:03.547 --> 02:21:05.549
We come off like amateurs.

02:21:05.757 --> 02:21:09.970
Some average band trying to
come to grips with success.

02:21:10.179 --> 02:21:12.639
Jealous and fighting
and breaking up.

02:21:12.848 --> 02:21:17.561
We're buffoons!
"Rock'n'roll can save the world"?

02:21:17.769 --> 02:21:21.148
"The chicks are great"?
I sound like a dick.

02:21:21.398 --> 02:21:23.525
- You are a dick.
- I never said that.

02:21:23.776 --> 02:21:26.361
Maybe we don't see ourselves
the way we really are.

02:21:26.945 --> 02:21:30.073
Is it that hard
to make us look cool?

02:21:30.908 --> 02:21:34.495
He has you on acid, screaming,
"I'm a golden god."

02:21:34.745 --> 02:21:38.832
They used him to fuck us. They'll
probably just put you on the cover.

02:21:39.082 --> 02:21:41.293
Wait. I never said,
"I'm a golden god."

02:21:44.004 --> 02:21:45.339
Or did I?

02:21:45.589 --> 02:21:48.217
We never took him seriously.
Now it's serious.

02:21:48.634 --> 02:21:50.093
I liked him as a person.

02:21:50.302 --> 02:21:54.223
He was never a person.
He was a journalist!

02:21:54.556 --> 02:21:58.227
You had the right idea
all along.

02:21:58.811 --> 02:22:01.730
- How about the flight?
- It's all there.

02:22:02.022 --> 02:22:04.358
It's unspecific who says what.

02:22:04.608 --> 02:22:07.611
No names are noted in
the embarrassing sequences.

02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:10.614
It's just obvious who's who
and we're fucked!

02:22:10.823 --> 02:22:14.618
I told him he could write
what he wanted.

02:22:18.038 --> 02:22:20.040
They haven't talked to Russell.

02:22:20.290 --> 02:22:25.045
Deny it to the fact checker.
One call. Then they can't print it.

02:22:25.295 --> 02:22:28.257
- Is that true?
- This is war, my friend.

02:22:28.465 --> 02:22:31.760
If you'd met me earlier,
he'd have never been here.

02:22:31.969 --> 02:22:35.639
He'll live.
Let's identify the goals here:

02:22:36.390 --> 02:22:40.602
T-shirts, foreign markets, your
contract, merchandising...

02:22:40.811 --> 02:22:42.771
...happiness...

02:22:42.980 --> 02:22:46.775
...realizing your dreams,
money, cool...

02:22:47.067 --> 02:22:49.027
...meeting the Beatles.

02:22:49.236 --> 02:22:54.783
Let's put all of it in the pot.
It all depends on mystique.

02:22:55.242 --> 02:22:57.995
Not giving too much away.

02:22:58.370 --> 02:23:00.664
I'm going to L.A.
Call if you need me.

02:23:00.873 --> 02:23:05.169
Before I go,
let me give you a lesson in mystique.

02:23:05.377 --> 02:23:09.006
You can only have one.
Which one do you want?

02:23:09.214 --> 02:23:11.800
Which one are you gonna choose?

02:23:13.427 --> 02:23:16.305
As long as you can't see
what's in this hand...

02:23:17.806 --> 02:23:20.392
...you'll always want it more.

02:23:24.104 --> 02:23:26.064
It's phenomenal,
to be honest with you.

02:23:26.315 --> 02:23:29.443
Sophisticated, intelligent.
We only cut out a couple of graphs.

02:23:29.693 --> 02:23:32.696
Jeff Bebe's mom sent over
a shoebox full of childhood photos.

02:23:32.946 --> 02:23:34.907
- She did?
- It's gonna look fantastic.

02:23:35.157 --> 02:23:39.453
The band just denied 90 percent
of the story. It's a fabrication.

02:23:40.329 --> 02:23:43.749
You weren't honest.
And worse, you wasted our time.

02:23:45.375 --> 02:23:47.753
Did you talk to Russell Hammond?

02:23:48.128 --> 02:23:49.963
He's the one who denied it.

02:23:50.214 --> 02:23:52.174
- Now wait a second.
- Denied it.

02:23:53.759 --> 02:23:56.970
We're going with The Who.
Manuscript's in my office.

02:23:57.179 --> 02:23:59.932
He's just some fan.
What do you expect?

02:24:01.642 --> 02:24:03.310
Ben! Wait!

02:24:28.085 --> 02:24:30.045
You guys, this is my brother.

02:24:30.629 --> 02:24:33.674
- Nice to finally meet you.
- You have a good day.

02:24:35.008 --> 02:24:36.844
You guys, I'll deadhead back later.

02:24:37.553 --> 02:24:39.012
I think I'm needed.

02:24:41.223 --> 02:24:42.516
See you.

02:24:49.148 --> 02:24:51.233
You look awful.

02:24:52.484 --> 02:24:53.777
But it's great.

02:24:53.986 --> 02:24:55.904
You're living your life.

02:24:56.155 --> 02:24:58.574
You're free of Mom.

02:25:02.536 --> 02:25:05.873
Hey, I'll take off work.

02:25:06.123 --> 02:25:09.793
Let's have an adventure together.
You and me, finally.

02:25:10.502 --> 02:25:15.424
Anywhere you want to go.
Anywhere in the world.

02:25:17.050 --> 02:25:19.178
This isn't my idea of a good time.

02:25:20.471 --> 02:25:22.723
- Just get me to my bed.
- I'll deal with her.

02:26:07.226 --> 02:26:09.019
I forgive you.

02:26:11.313 --> 02:26:13.398
I didn't apologize.

02:26:46.765 --> 02:26:48.016
Hey, Sapphire.

02:26:48.225 --> 02:26:49.726
Hey, boy.

02:26:51.228 --> 02:26:54.481
- I hate goodbyes.
- Me too.

02:26:55.941 --> 02:26:58.360
All right, so I didn't like you much.

02:26:58.569 --> 02:27:00.863
Do we have to like each other?

02:27:01.572 --> 02:27:04.616
I sort of thought so.

02:27:04.908 --> 02:27:08.829
I think it would've worked
against us, I really do.

02:27:09.037 --> 02:27:13.333
You know what they say: All the
great partnerships hated each other.

02:27:14.042 --> 02:27:16.336
We didn't hate
each other that much, did we?

02:27:16.545 --> 02:27:18.255
No, maybe not.

02:27:18.714 --> 02:27:21.175
I could work on it, though.

02:27:27.389 --> 02:27:30.601
I just can't picture you
with Leslie.

02:27:31.435 --> 02:27:35.522
I'm the you they get,
when they can't get you.

02:27:48.786 --> 02:27:51.163
- Sorry.
- Forget it. It's cool.

02:27:51.371 --> 02:27:54.792
- I'll see you later on.
- All right. See you.

02:28:05.636 --> 02:28:07.429
Is Penny okay?

02:28:08.597 --> 02:28:10.265
The Quaaludes incident?

02:28:11.016 --> 02:28:13.101
Well, it wasn't pretty.

02:28:13.352 --> 02:28:15.062
She could've died.

02:28:16.396 --> 02:28:20.609
I always told her not to let
too many guys fall in love with her.

02:28:20.818 --> 02:28:23.612
Guess I was wrong.
One of them saved her life.

02:28:25.364 --> 02:28:26.406
William?

02:28:26.657 --> 02:28:30.369
What do you care? I mean,
we all know what you did to him.

02:28:30.619 --> 02:28:33.205
I mean, everybody knows.

02:28:34.873 --> 02:28:36.750
Even Penny Lane.

02:28:43.090 --> 02:28:46.135
Something tells me,
20 years from now...

02:28:46.677 --> 02:28:49.304
...we'll remember her.

02:28:49.847 --> 02:28:52.683
And not much else.

02:28:59.565 --> 02:29:01.525
Can you believe these girls?

02:29:01.817 --> 02:29:05.195
None of them use birth control,
and they eat all the steak.

02:29:06.196 --> 02:29:10.117
I mean, they don't even know
what it is to be a fan.

02:29:10.826 --> 02:29:14.997
You know, to truly love some
silly little piece of music...

02:29:15.247 --> 02:29:19.209
...or some band so much...

02:29:19.418 --> 02:29:20.878
...that it hurts.

02:29:28.135 --> 02:29:29.178
Hello, Penny?

02:29:29.428 --> 02:29:31.472
<i>It's Russell. Don't hang up.</i>

02:29:31.722 --> 02:29:34.808
<i>I can't really talk now.</i>
<i>I'm in a roomful of people.</i>

02:29:43.317 --> 02:29:45.194
Actually, I'm alone.

02:29:47.738 --> 02:29:49.156
I won't call again, I promise.

02:29:50.365 --> 02:29:54.119
<i>But I need to see you face to face...</i>

02:29:54.328 --> 02:29:57.539
<i>... because I'm never</i>
<i>as good as when you're there...</i>

02:29:57.748 --> 02:30:02.252
<i>... and I can see myself</i>
<i>the way you look at me.</i>

02:30:02.461 --> 02:30:06.965
<i>And I'm sorry. If we could</i>
<i>just get together and talk...</i>

02:30:12.554 --> 02:30:14.640
Let's say all the things
we never said.

02:30:19.019 --> 02:30:20.270
<i>Give me your address.</i>

02:30:22.898 --> 02:30:24.691
I'm coming to you...

02:30:25.609 --> 02:30:27.194
...this time.

02:30:41.542 --> 02:30:43.377
<i>Got a pen?</i>

02:31:02.271 --> 02:31:03.772
Hello, Penny.

02:31:04.022 --> 02:31:05.816
Hello, Penny.

02:31:17.744 --> 02:31:19.580
I'm Russell Hammond.

02:31:20.998 --> 02:31:24.793
So this is the famous Russell Hammond.

02:31:30.883 --> 02:31:32.092
Come in.

02:31:38.182 --> 02:31:41.894
- Is she home?
- Who? Anita?

02:31:50.068 --> 02:31:51.445
- Where am I?
- Hello?

02:31:52.279 --> 02:31:53.322
Hi.

02:31:53.989 --> 02:31:57.451
You know, when we spoke,
I felt that we connected.

02:32:20.682 --> 02:32:22.976
Oh, man...

02:32:30.776 --> 02:32:33.320
My son is very important to me too.

02:32:33.570 --> 02:32:36.198
And I do think you owe him
an apology.

02:32:37.324 --> 02:32:40.494
- I appreciate you showing up.
- No, no, I agree.

02:32:45.499 --> 02:32:48.627
There's hope for you yet, Russell.

02:33:03.684 --> 02:33:04.893
Well...

02:33:11.024 --> 02:33:12.151
Hi.

02:33:13.485 --> 02:33:15.320
So this is...

02:33:17.281 --> 02:33:18.991
...where the Enemy sleeps.

02:33:25.414 --> 02:33:28.876
You know, I think we both
wanted to be with her.

02:33:33.755 --> 02:33:36.175
And she wanted us to be together.

02:33:51.482 --> 02:33:53.358
You should give her a call.

02:33:54.193 --> 02:33:55.903
You both live in the same city.

02:34:01.241 --> 02:34:03.535
- You really think I should?
- Yeah.

02:34:06.872 --> 02:34:09.333
That girl really cares about you.

02:34:12.252 --> 02:34:14.129
Man, I never even knew her real name.

02:34:21.220 --> 02:34:24.348
Oh, I called your magazine...

02:34:25.057 --> 02:34:27.059
...and told them the truth.

02:34:29.394 --> 02:34:33.315
I don't know what they'll do, but I
said every word you wrote was true.

02:34:40.697 --> 02:34:44.785
We are gonna do this one more time.

02:34:56.880 --> 02:34:57.923
So, Russell...

02:35:00.926 --> 02:35:03.345
...what do you love about music?

02:35:13.814 --> 02:35:15.649
To begin with...

02:35:17.067 --> 02:35:18.360
...everything.

02:35:26.743 --> 02:35:28.787
- Tickets!
- How much?

02:35:45.220 --> 02:35:47.431
Morocco.
Seat by the window, please.

02:35:55.981 --> 02:35:57.441
Thank you.
