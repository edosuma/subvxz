WEBVTT

00:29.130 --> 00:30.696
- Hi, I'm Vikki George,

00:30.731 --> 00:33.065
and welcome to the
      Community Garden.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.701
This is a space where people
 who don't have gardens

00:35.736 --> 00:37.503
of their own get a plot of land

00:37.538 --> 00:40.039
and get to build the
    garden of their dreams.

00:40.074 --> 00:43.409
So, today, you guys
     are gonna get a plot

00:43.444 --> 00:46.178
and the flowers that you
    plant of your very own

00:46.213 --> 00:47.913
will become fully
      in bloom in time

00:47.948 --> 00:51.216
for our Garden Walk Festival
 at the end of the month.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.017
Yeah.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.585
- Is this your garden?

00:53.621 --> 00:54.820
- No, sweetie.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.755
But I do manage the
     Community Garden.

00:56.791 --> 00:59.892
My dad started this
     garden 20 years ago.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.293
For him, it was a way to

01:01.328 --> 01:03.462
give something back
     to the neighborhood.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.598
So, who's ready
      to see their plot?

01:06.634 --> 01:07.399
- Me!

01:07.435 --> 01:08.200
- Are you!

01:08.235 --> 01:08.967
All of you?

01:09.003 --> 01:10.002
- Yes!

01:10.037 --> 01:10.936
- Okay, follow me.

01:13.007 --> 01:14.106
So ta-da!

01:15.076 --> 01:16.442
This is your garden clubs plot.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.943
Now does everybody
     have their seedlings?

01:17.978 --> 01:18.977
- Yes!

01:19.013 --> 01:19.845
- Okay great!

01:19.880 --> 01:20.846
Well, let's get to planting.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.115
Grab a shovel, dig on in.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.185
- This was a great idea.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.886
All of our kids
     live in apartments.

01:27.922 --> 01:28.754
They don't have
      a garden at home.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.656
- Well, that's why
      we have the space.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.724
Everybody deserves a right
 to cultivate a green thumb.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.294
And you would be surprised how
 fast those flowers will grow.

01:35.329 --> 01:38.163
I think they're really gonna
 enjoy their weekly visits.

01:38.199 --> 01:38.997
Oh!

01:39.066 --> 01:40.265
Please come back
     for the Garden Walk

01:40.301 --> 01:41.200
at the end of the month.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.568
It's our big yearly festival.

01:44.872 --> 01:45.604
- Vikki!

01:45.639 --> 01:46.472
Vikki George!

01:49.076 --> 01:50.442
- Hi Mr. Boyle, hi Ms. Hewitt.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.643
Isn't it a lovely day?

01:51.679 --> 01:53.712
- Vikki, I thought
     you should have these.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.280
All the rain we had this winter,

01:55.316 --> 01:56.782
my tomatoes ripened early.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.685
- The first crop of spring,
 have a look at these beauties.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.586
- Oh!

02:00.621 --> 02:01.820
Wait, all of this is for me?

02:01.856 --> 02:03.288
- There'd be plenty more
    where that came from.

02:03.324 --> 02:06.258
I can tell I'm gonna have
  a bumper crop this year.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.993
- Well, me too.

02:08.027 --> 02:10.795
I have a perfect stuffed
  tomato recipe to give you.

02:10.830 --> 02:11.797
It's delicious.

02:11.832 --> 02:12.965
- And stuffed peppers.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.600
Don't forget the
     peppers Ms. Hewitt.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.668
- You'd never let me Mr. Boyle.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.671
You can use the same
    recipe with the peppers.

02:19.707 --> 02:20.839
- Thank you.

02:20.875 --> 02:21.974
I think it sounds like
    a delicious combination.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.643
Also, I made up flyers for
  the Garden Walk Festival.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.478
- Oh, we gonna win
     Best Garden this year?

02:26.514 --> 02:27.880
- We've got our fingers crossed.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.082
- This is gonna be our
     year, I can feel it.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.783
Besides, can you
     guys imagine a more

02:31.819 --> 02:33.185
beautiful garden than ours?

02:44.098 --> 02:45.597
I'm late, I'm late,
     I know I'm late!

02:45.633 --> 02:47.099
Ooh, sorry to
     interrupt you guys!

02:47.134 --> 02:48.834
I got stuck at the
      Community Garden

02:48.869 --> 02:49.835
giving a school tour.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.737
- Hey Vikki, I was just
    dropping off her lunch.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.138
- I forgot it again.

02:53.174 --> 02:54.673
Maybe on purpose.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.175
- You guys are so cute together.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.776
Like seriously, too cute.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.345
I can't believe you've
  been married for 12 years.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.947
- See you at home honey.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.284
- How do you do it Anna?

03:05.319 --> 03:06.885
- Vikki, you too
      could have it all

03:06.921 --> 03:10.155
if you put half the energy
  you put into that garden

03:10.191 --> 03:10.989
into your dating life.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.758
- Ah, that is a
      horse that I'm not

03:12.793 --> 03:14.259
interested in climbing back on.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.394
Thank you.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.595
- Yeah, well, maybe
     if your last boyfriend

03:16.630 --> 03:18.630
hadn't just gone
    riding into the sunset.

03:18.666 --> 03:19.398
- I know.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.866
I cultivated it.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.802
I waited for the fruits
  to bloom and then nothing.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.304
We just broke up.

03:26.473 --> 03:27.973
Okay fine, he broke up with me.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.074
And with no explanation.

03:29.109 --> 03:31.143
- You weren't right for
  each other to begin with.

03:31.178 --> 03:31.977
- It doesn't matter.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.545
Dating is just not for me.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.614
Not now, maybe not ever.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.015
I'm done.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.984
You know, you are so lucky
 you met Alex in high school.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.386
You guys are like
     the perfect couple.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.188
- Yeah, we are pretty perfect.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.056
For each other.

03:44.158 --> 03:45.724
And if you just put
     yourself out there,

03:45.759 --> 03:48.060
you can find someone that's
 pretty perfect for you too.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.261
- Oh really?

03:49.296 --> 03:50.596
Do you remember what
     happened the last time

03:50.631 --> 03:52.598
I took your advice and
    I put myself out there?

03:52.633 --> 03:53.765
I met Barry.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.133
- That one was doomed
     from the start.

03:55.169 --> 03:56.902
The guy was severely
     allergic to flowers.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.104
- I know, and I work
     with flowers all day.

03:59.139 --> 04:00.973
I mean, I practically
     am a flower.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.275
He had to take an antihistamine
before every date.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.644
Besides, I don't really
    have time to date.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.179
I've got Garden Walk in a month,

04:07.214 --> 04:08.747
and I have to make
      sure every plot

04:08.782 --> 04:10.649
in that garden is perfect.

04:10.684 --> 04:13.385
- And knowing you,
      I'm sure you will.

04:25.199 --> 04:27.266
- Oh, good afternoon Mr. Devine.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.334
- Ilya, how many
     times have I told you,

04:29.370 --> 04:30.135
call me Chace.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.037
- Oh, I'm sorry, Chace.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.138
- Thank you.

04:33.173 --> 04:33.972
I'm just going to look
     at a new property,

04:34.008 --> 04:35.407
but you can reach
      me on my phone.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.310
- Oh Chace, I just
    wanted to say thank you.

04:38.345 --> 04:39.745
- For what?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.680
- You gave my brother a job
 on your newest development

04:41.715 --> 04:44.116
and I just wanted you to
    know I'm very grateful.

04:44.151 --> 04:44.950
- Don't be.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.119
Plus, it's part of
      what we do here.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.553
Create jobs.

04:48.589 --> 04:49.254
I gotta get going.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.455
I'll see you when I get back?

04:50.491 --> 04:51.323
- Okay.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.100
- You're gonna have
     to let me post that.

05:03.037 --> 05:03.902
Gorgeous!

05:05.172 --> 05:06.605
I'm gonna use this
      to post a story

05:06.640 --> 05:08.507
on social media about
  the Garden Walk Festival.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.775
- Oh great, the
      more the merrier.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.243
I'm actually having
     flyers printed up

05:11.278 --> 05:12.177
to distribute as well.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.745
- You are so old school.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.214
You need to get on social media.

05:16.250 --> 05:16.915
- No.

05:16.950 --> 05:17.616
- No, it's great for everything!

05:17.651 --> 05:21.153
Friendships, staying connected.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.454
Dating.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.424
- I would prefer to meet
 someone the old fashioned way.

05:25.459 --> 05:28.093
You know, like through
     friends, or at a cafe.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.594
- There's a cafe app for that.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.463
- Thanks but no thanks.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.564
Suite yourself.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.368
- Excuse me, I'm looking
    for Vikki George.

05:36.403 --> 05:37.502
- Oh.

05:39.039 --> 05:39.838
- Oh!

05:39.873 --> 05:40.605
- Oh, I am.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.307
Oh, I am so sorry.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.275
Here, let me just.

05:43.310 --> 05:43.975
- No.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.077
- If I wait a bit.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.845
- Just, making it worse.
  - It's just rubbing it in.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.313
- Okay, that's gonna
 need to go to the cleaners.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.115
- It's okay, it'll be fine.

05:51.085 --> 05:51.783
- Sorry.

05:51.819 --> 05:52.484
- Maybe you can help me.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.819
I'm looking for Victoria George.

05:53.854 --> 05:54.986
- Victoria?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.855
Everybody usually
     just calls me Vikki.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.023
- Oh.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.624
- Almost did it again!

05:59.660 --> 06:01.093
Occupational hazard.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.227
The dirt.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.962
Anyway, yup.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.398
I'm Vikki George.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.400
- I'm Chace Devine.

06:08.435 --> 06:09.901
I was told that
      you could give me

06:09.937 --> 06:12.304
a tour of the garden, maybe
 answer a few questions?

06:12.339 --> 06:14.072
- Oh, I'd be happy to.

06:14.108 --> 06:15.173
I am the manager.

06:15.275 --> 06:18.710
And after all, you actually
 came at the perfect time.

06:18.746 --> 06:22.481
Spring has sprung and
 everything is fully in bloom.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.416
It's my favorite time of year.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.385
So this is Serena.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.452
- Hi.

06:27.521 --> 06:30.355
- She made her plot
 completely out of wildflowers.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.124
If you came here at six a.m.,

06:32.159 --> 06:34.359
the aroma coming
     from Serena's plot,

06:34.395 --> 06:36.228
it's just indescribable.

06:36.263 --> 06:38.430
It's as if night
        blooming Jasmine

06:38.465 --> 06:40.599
and honeysuckle had a baby.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.068
Oh, and these are our
 resident vegetable gardeners.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.370
Mr. Boyle grows the
     most elegant peppers.

06:45.406 --> 06:48.407
And Mrs. Hewitt, the
    most beautiful tomatoes.

06:48.442 --> 06:49.274
This is Chace Devine,

06:49.343 --> 06:50.709
he's just taking a
     tour of the garden.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.111
- Well, he can't leave
     without a tomato.

06:53.147 --> 06:56.214
No one leaves our
    garden without a tomato.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.349
- Thank you, but I--

06:57.384 --> 06:58.250
- Of course he doesn't want one.

06:58.318 --> 07:00.485
Not unless he has one
     of these bad boys.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.219
- Okay.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.654
- Have another tomato.

07:02.689 --> 07:05.123
Now you've got enough to make
 a nice fresh tomato sauce.

07:05.159 --> 07:06.691
- What are
     you doing Mrs. Hewitt?

07:06.727 --> 07:09.428
- I'm just helping this nice
 man with his dinner plans.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.128
- Really?

07:10.164 --> 07:11.363
You're being the sweet old lady

07:11.398 --> 07:13.231
with a vine ripened tomato.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.967
And I'm just the old
    codger with the peppers.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.068
Vikki, would you
     please tell her that--

07:17.104 --> 07:20.105
- Don't you drag Vikki
 into this, she's on a tour.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.373
- They're actually very sweet.

07:21.408 --> 07:24.042
They just get a little
     competitive over their
     vegetables.

07:24.077 --> 07:27.078
But, anyway, that's our garden.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.448
Unfortunately right now we
don't have any available plots,

07:29.483 --> 07:31.583
but if you'd like, I can
  put you on the wait list.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.452
As long as you can prove
    neighborhood residency,

07:33.487 --> 07:34.886
it shouldn't be a problem.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.489
- Those weren't exactly the
 kind of questions I had.

07:37.524 --> 07:38.623
- Oh?

07:40.294 --> 07:41.726
- I've studied the zoning law,

07:41.762 --> 07:43.128
so there's no questions there.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.530
- Why do you care
     about our zoning laws?

07:46.300 --> 07:47.833
- Just trying to
      think practically.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.468
- Yeah, but about what?

07:49.503 --> 07:52.137
- About how to properly
    utilize this space.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.105
- Well, it's a garden,

07:54.141 --> 07:57.108
so you properly utilize
    it by gardening.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.947
You know what, I'm just gonna
 add you to the wait list.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.116
Way down at the bottom.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.153
- There's no need to do that.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.087
I'm not waiting.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.491
- Tell me Mr. Devine,

08:13.460 --> 08:15.427
what does your garden grow?

08:15.462 --> 08:17.529
- Condos, from the ground up.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.331
Thanks for the tour.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.533
It's really a beautiful space.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.668
Exactly what I'm looking for.

08:29.743 --> 08:33.410
- "Devine Construction, building
better from the ground up."

08:33.447 --> 08:36.147
- Chace Devine is a
     real estate developer.

08:36.183 --> 08:36.982
He builds condos.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.216
- "From the ground up."

08:38.251 --> 08:39.951
That's what he said
     to me at the garden.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.520
- What do you
     think this means?

08:41.554 --> 08:42.486
- I don't know.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.054
But I'm not liking the
     feeling I'm getting.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.358
I think maybe I should
     talk to Mr. Mack.

08:46.393 --> 08:47.759
- That's a great idea.

08:47.794 --> 08:48.827
I mean you've been
  renting from him forever.

08:48.862 --> 08:49.995
He'll know what's going on.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.429
- I'm sure there's
    nothing to worry about.

08:51.465 --> 08:52.531
He loves the garden.

08:52.566 --> 08:53.665
- Yeah.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.335
- My hands are tied Vikki.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.504
- But Mr. Mack, you
     love the garden.

08:59.540 --> 09:00.772
You've told me so yourself.

09:00.807 --> 09:01.640
- I do love it.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.241
And I loved your dad.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.943
Our deal goes back
      to when he first

09:04.978 --> 09:07.712
started the Community
     Garden 20 years ago.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.814
- I know, so then
     why are you selling?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.449
- My daughter lives in Hawaii

09:11.485 --> 09:13.251
and she's having a baby
    in a couple of months.

09:13.287 --> 09:14.319
It's gonna be my
      first grandchild.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.520
- Well that's great news, but--

09:15.556 --> 09:17.522
- Palm trees and
     golden sandy beaches

09:17.558 --> 09:19.491
that extend for miles.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.027
How does that
     sound to you Vikki?

09:22.062 --> 09:23.428
- Like Florida.

09:23.463 --> 09:24.429
Where we live already.

09:24.464 --> 09:25.964
- I'm ready to retire.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.165
Be around family.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.900
- But do you have
     to sell the garden?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.637
- I sold the garden
     this morning Vikki.

09:32.673 --> 09:33.672
- What?

09:33.707 --> 09:35.707
No, not to Devine Construction.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.375
- I was gonna come
     over to the nursery

09:37.411 --> 09:38.476
and tell you in person,

09:38.512 --> 09:39.744
but yes it's sold.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.280
And yes to Chace Devine.

09:42.316 --> 09:45.383
- Mr. Mack, that garden
    was my dads dream.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.751
A garden for the community.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.186
A garden for everyone.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.255
- The garden has always
 been an investment property.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.423
I made the deal with your dad

09:51.458 --> 09:52.958
because we were old army buddies

09:52.993 --> 09:56.428
and he had this dream and
 I just couldn't refuse him.

09:56.463 --> 09:59.364
But I never planned on
 making any money off of it.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.666
And then comes Chace Devine

10:01.702 --> 10:04.636
and he offered me a
     lot of money Vikki.

10:04.671 --> 10:05.870
Retirement money.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.539
Spoil my grandchild money.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.373
- But why didn't you at least

10:08.442 --> 10:10.942
give us a chance
     to match the offer?

10:10.978 --> 10:14.045
- Because you don't have
  that kind of money Vikki.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.881
You would have bought this
  place long ago if you did.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.022
I'm very sorry.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.156
But you know what?

10:25.192 --> 10:28.526
It's time for you to
    make a new place for it.

10:28.562 --> 10:29.461
I mean do what your dad did

10:29.563 --> 10:31.162
when he first started
     the Community Garden.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.164
I mean show some gumption.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.500
- Gumption?

10:35.535 --> 10:37.235
- That was one of your
  dad's greatest qualities.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.704
Gumption, initiative.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.807
Find the new spot for the
  garden and build it back.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.544
- From the ground up.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.247
- Exactly, from the ground up.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.388
- Thanks mom.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.657
Your veggie lasagna
     always cheers me up.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.091
- Well, things will
     seem a lot brighter

11:00.127 --> 11:01.626
once you've got something
  in your stomach.

11:01.662 --> 11:02.761
You'll see.

11:02.796 --> 11:03.628
- I think it's gonna
     take more than lasagna

11:03.664 --> 11:05.430
to fix this problem.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.632
- I've got carrot
      cake for dessert.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.301
- It's gonna take
     more than that too.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.704
Although I definitely
     wanna have that cake.

11:13.874 --> 11:14.973
I don't know,

11:15.008 --> 11:15.940
I just feel like
     the garden was dad's

11:15.976 --> 11:17.142
legacy to the neighborhood.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.510
And I just feel
     like I'd be letting

11:18.545 --> 11:20.712
everybody down if
      I just let it go.

11:20.747 --> 11:23.581
You, the neighborhood, dad.

11:23.617 --> 11:24.883
Especially dad.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.652
- Vikki honey, don't put
    this all on yourself.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.487
- But it is on me mom.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.056
It's all right on top of me

11:31.091 --> 11:33.792
and I'm here at the bottom
  just being crushed by it.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.095
I mean he built that
     garden out of nothing,

11:37.130 --> 11:39.597
and there is no way
     dad would let anybody

11:39.633 --> 11:42.467
like Chace Devine stand
    in the way of his dream.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.903
- Have you tried talking
    to this Chace Devine?

11:44.938 --> 11:46.037
- Ugh.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.439
- Maybe he's not as
    bad as you think he is.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.275
First impressions
      can be deceiving.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.476
- You're right.

11:51.511 --> 11:52.410
You're right mom.

11:52.446 --> 11:53.645
There's gotta be a solution.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.947
Maybe if he just
    understood how important

11:55.982 --> 11:57.382
the garden was to the community.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.284
I mean, he's gotta
    have a heart underneath

11:59.319 --> 12:03.154
that well-tailored,
     very expensive looking
     suit somewhere.

12:03.190 --> 12:06.391
- Well sweetheart, there's
  only way to find out.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.728
Go to his office
     and show him exactly

12:09.763 --> 12:11.362
how persuasive you can be.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.442
- So not me.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.559
Look up, there's a way
     over every obstacle.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.706
- So, tell me.

12:54.741 --> 12:55.807
What do you think?

12:56.810 --> 12:59.310
I went for minimalism.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.979
I thought it spoke power.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.748
And you honey are the
  most powerful man I know.

13:04.684 --> 13:05.750
Less is more right?

13:06.787 --> 13:10.555
I wanted it to feel
     like an empty room.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.426
- Well it does feel that way.

13:17.597 --> 13:18.830
Which makes me wonder,

13:19.599 --> 13:20.999
how did you spend
      that much money

13:21.034 --> 13:23.668
if you're going for nothing?

13:23.703 --> 13:25.103
- I only bought the best.

13:25.138 --> 13:25.837
- Uh huh.

13:25.872 --> 13:27.238
- Take that sculpture.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.606
It's my favorite piece.

13:28.642 --> 13:32.210
Sure it cost $2,000,
     but it's brilliant

13:32.245 --> 13:34.879
because it's like a little table

13:34.915 --> 13:37.115
but nothing will ever go on it.

13:38.685 --> 13:39.918
Minimalism.

13:41.721 --> 13:42.821
So?

13:43.690 --> 13:44.589
You like it!

13:45.992 --> 13:47.158
Thank you Chace.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.860
Thank you for giving
     me this opportunity.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.929
I always thought that
     I could be a designer,

13:50.964 --> 13:53.164
but no one ever
     gave me the chance.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.632
- Well, you did a bang up job.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.167
- You really think so?

13:56.203 --> 13:56.835
- Yeah.

13:56.870 --> 13:57.535
- I'm so glad.

13:57.571 --> 14:00.638
This has been more than design.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.741
This has been a voyage
     of self-discovery.

14:03.777 --> 14:04.642
- Okay.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.678
- It's inspired me
     to go minimal myself.

14:06.713 --> 14:07.645
- That's great.

14:07.681 --> 14:08.813
- I mean it Chace.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.950
I'm gonna start paring
     down, start fresh.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.384
- Yeah.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.153
- Next time you see me,
  I'll be a whole new Marta.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.156
We should celebrate!

14:18.191 --> 14:19.991
- We will celebrate, tonight.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.793
I just purchased a new property.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.462
It's a garden I'm
    converting into condos.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.663
- Ooh.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.299
- So we'll celebrate
     the condos and you.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.100
- Okay!

14:29.135 --> 14:30.001
- Okay?

14:30.737 --> 14:32.570
Yeah, see ya tonight.

14:32.606 --> 14:34.038
Whole new Marta.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.478
Minimalism.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.480
- I'm sorry, but no one sees

14:42.515 --> 14:43.848
Mr. Devine without
      an appointment.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.083
- This is important.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.784
If you could please
     just buzz his office

14:46.820 --> 14:49.087
and tell him that
     Vikki George is here,

14:49.122 --> 14:50.989
I'm pretty sure he'd
     be willing to see me.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.857
- I'm sorry, but we
     don't make exceptions.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.158
Now, if you'd like to
     make an appointment--

14:54.194 --> 14:55.727
- No, I don't have
      time for that.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.662
This is a pressing matter.

14:57.697 --> 15:00.598
- Everything in Mr. Devine's
 life is a pressing matter.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.934
I'm sorry, but you're
     going to have to go.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.636
- Fine.

15:04.671 --> 15:05.870
But I'm taking this back.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.373
- Ilya, I need you.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.775
Chace and I are
     celebrating tonight.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.477
He loved the new office.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.745
I need you to make
      the reservations.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.914
Some place classy like Shiro's.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.383
I'm so happy Ilya,
     he really loved it.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.124
- Oh, hi.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.025
- Hi?

15:28.128 --> 15:29.861
- Sorry, do you remember me?

15:30.897 --> 15:31.829
- Of course, from
      the garden, right.

15:31.865 --> 15:33.197
Do we have an appointment?

15:33.233 --> 15:34.666
- No, but you know what?

15:34.701 --> 15:35.867
Appointments are so formal,

15:35.902 --> 15:38.770
and I'm more like a fly by
 the seat of my pants type gal.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.338
And anyway, I just
     need to speak to you

15:40.373 --> 15:41.572
about something for a minute.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.540
It'll just take a
     minute of your time.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.242
- For you I have several.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.977
Like two.

15:46.012 --> 15:46.878
- Oh.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.813
Well, I brought you
     a peace offering.

15:48.848 --> 15:51.983
Like literally, this
    is called a peace lily.

15:52.018 --> 15:54.085
- I didn't realize
      we were at war.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.522
- A little sunlight, some water,

15:57.557 --> 15:58.523
and this guy's gonna flourish.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.926
And you could definitely
    use some green in here.

16:01.962 --> 16:05.063
I mean, it is sparse.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.298
- It's minimalist.

16:07.334 --> 16:10.802
- Yeah, well there's
    very little in here so,

16:10.837 --> 16:11.970
well done.

16:13.039 --> 16:15.373
- I assume you didn't come
  here to bring me a plant.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.041
- Oh, I just never go
     anywhere empty handed.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.243
But yeah, I wanted
      to talk to you

16:19.279 --> 16:21.346
about the Community Garden.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.381
- What about the garden?

16:23.416 --> 16:25.016
- You can't dig up our garden.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.784
I mean it's a vital
     part of our community.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.252
We host numerous
      year-round events.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.854
Children have their
     birthdays there.

16:29.889 --> 16:30.989
My best friends
      got married there,

16:31.024 --> 16:32.523
but it's not just that.

16:32.559 --> 16:33.624
It's a beacon.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.760
I mean it reminds people
 that you can come together,

16:35.795 --> 16:37.929
and you can't just
      take that away.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.631
- What do you propose?

16:40.667 --> 16:41.899
- Well I was sort
     of wondering if you

16:41.935 --> 16:43.134
could just find it in your heart

16:43.169 --> 16:45.336
to renew our lease
     and save our garden.

16:47.574 --> 16:48.906
- Vikki, right?

16:48.942 --> 16:49.807
- Yeah.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.143
- I'm a business man.

16:52.946 --> 16:54.779
Anyway you slice it,
     gardens don't bring

16:54.814 --> 16:56.447
in the green the way condos do.

16:56.483 --> 16:59.183
And people depend on me
    to bring in the green.

17:01.588 --> 17:02.453
See,

17:03.890 --> 17:09.093
I've acquired all the
    land around the garden,

17:09.863 --> 17:11.329
which functions
      as a parking lot.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.829
But now that I've acquired
  the garden as well,

17:12.866 --> 17:16.067
my company can build condos
 for people to live in.

17:17.137 --> 17:20.238
I wish I could help you, but
 it's business, not personal.

17:25.779 --> 17:28.512
- You know, the thing
     is it is personal.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.549
And I think that you are
  making a terrible mistake.

17:32.786 --> 17:33.851
And I'm gonna prove it to you.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.053
- I'd love to see that.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.521
- Oh, you will see it.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.389
Because I'm gonna be
  back with concrete proof.

17:38.425 --> 17:39.924
Which you'll appreciate
    because there's

17:39.959 --> 17:41.225
concrete in buildings
  and that's the only thing

17:41.261 --> 17:42.527
you seem to care about anyway.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.996
So, I'll be back.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.230
- Look forward to it!

17:57.677 --> 17:59.977
- Guys, if I could just
    borrow you for a minute.

18:00.013 --> 18:02.346
If everybody could
     gather around, thanks.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.817
So I know that some
     of you have heard

18:05.852 --> 18:09.821
by now that our beloved
Community Garden is in trouble.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.890
A developer named Chace
 Devine has bought the garden

18:12.926 --> 18:15.193
and he plans to rip it
     out and build condos.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.661
- That's awful.

18:16.696 --> 18:17.929
- We have to do something.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.130
- You're right, we do.

18:19.165 --> 18:20.531
- Then he'll think
     twice about bringing

18:20.567 --> 18:22.066
his condos into
      our neighborhood.

18:22.102 --> 18:22.900
- But
      how do we do that?

18:22.936 --> 18:24.469
- We can
      have a bake sale.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.170
- Oh, what a good idea!

18:26.206 --> 18:27.271
I have a good cupcake recipe.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.375
- Please, guys.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.310
I have an idea.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.946
I think if we could
     just start a petition,

18:34.981 --> 18:36.714
we gather as many
     signatures as we can

18:36.749 --> 18:38.416
and that way we can
     show how much support

18:38.451 --> 18:40.184
we have within the neighborhood.

18:40.220 --> 18:43.221
- If he's a man of
    business, he can't deny

18:43.256 --> 18:45.289
something black and white
  right in front of him.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.225
- I can start an
     online petition too.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.594
Post it on social media,
    every single platform.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.995
- Oh, that's a great idea!

18:51.030 --> 18:52.897
We can use as many
  signatures as we can get.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.999
- What about the
     Garden Walk Festival?

18:55.034 --> 18:56.501
It's only three weeks away.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.169
Are we still participating?

18:58.204 --> 18:59.003
- This year more than ever.

18:59.038 --> 19:01.606
Not only are we
      gonna participate,

19:01.641 --> 19:03.374
we're gonna win
      that Garden Walk.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.576
This year, when our
  neighbors open their doors

19:05.612 --> 19:08.579
to their gardens, we
 should be front and center.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.815
If we can win best garden,

19:10.850 --> 19:12.383
Chace Devine is
      gonna have a very

19:12.418 --> 19:14.085
difficult time ripping
     out this garden

19:14.120 --> 19:16.687
and then having to justify it
 to the entire neighborhood.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.856
I think if we can
      stand together,

19:18.892 --> 19:21.359
we can stop him from
    taking down our garden.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.226
Now who is with me!

19:22.262 --> 19:23.861
- Yes!

19:23.897 --> 19:24.662
- We can do it!

19:24.697 --> 19:26.831
- Let's save our garden!

19:27.901 --> 19:29.133
- All of us.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.701
- Okay, everybody
     grab your clipboards.

19:30.737 --> 19:31.836
You're good.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.838
We need to get as many
    signatures as possible.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.106
Thank you so much.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.240
Here you go.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.316
- Save our garden.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.083
Thank you.

19:46.119 --> 19:46.884
- Oh hey!

19:46.920 --> 19:48.352
Could you sign?

19:49.355 --> 19:50.454
Right here.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.290
Thank you.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.658
- Hi, do you mind signing
 save the garden real quick?

19:53.693 --> 19:54.458
- Sure, sure.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.793
- Right there.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.331
- Another tomato Mr. Boyle.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.200
I'm almost done with my basket.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.334
- That's because
      these baskets hold

20:03.369 --> 20:05.803
more peppers than tomatoes.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.672
Sign here, get two peppers.

20:07.707 --> 20:11.309
- Two tomatoes with
     every signature!

20:11.344 --> 20:12.343
Two.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.444
- Hey, great.

20:13.479 --> 20:14.345
Thank you.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.513
Back right on time.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.247
Thank you.

20:16.282 --> 20:17.548
Awesome, thank you.

20:18.251 --> 20:18.950
- Got it!

20:18.985 --> 20:20.952
- I got 75 signatures.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.420
- I got 82.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.225
- And make sure there's
    plenty of reporters

20:27.260 --> 20:29.193
at the ground breaking ceremony.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.462
We need the name
     Devine Construction

20:31.497 --> 20:34.332
in a positive light
     as much as possible.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.801
After that, we'll focus
    on the garden property.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.871
There's been a little push
  back from the community.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.473
Nothing we haven't seen before.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.177
Well don't worry.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.279
We're set and on schedule
  with the garden property.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.780
Nothing's gonna hold it up.

20:51.985 --> 20:54.385
Yeah, I'm gonna have
     to call you back.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.319
Hi.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.454
- What's that?

20:57.257 --> 20:58.589
- What, the plant?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.424
It's a gift from Vikki George.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.226
- And who is Vikki George?

21:02.262 --> 21:04.362
- She's a disgruntled citizen.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.264
Runs the Community
     Garden I just bought.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.066
- And she brought you a plant?

21:09.102 --> 21:10.134
- What?

21:10.169 --> 21:10.835
She was just trying
     to convince me

21:10.870 --> 21:12.637
not to build over the garden.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.440
She's very passionate,
     I admire that.

21:16.476 --> 21:19.710
- Well, I don't admire that.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.712
It doesn't work with
     the minimalism Chace.

21:21.748 --> 21:24.348
- Don't you think
     it brings the space

21:24.384 --> 21:26.984
a sort of homey quality?

21:27.020 --> 21:29.520
- We're not going for homey.

21:31.157 --> 21:32.556
I'm just gonna...

21:33.593 --> 21:34.792
- I like the plant.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.162
Even if it doesn't
     match the aesthetic.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.563
- Come on Chace.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.232
You Know you've really
     helped me change

21:41.267 --> 21:42.500
my entire outlook.

21:43.603 --> 21:44.669
- How so?

21:44.704 --> 21:47.171
- Not only am I looking
  into designing full-time,

21:47.206 --> 21:49.373
but I've been going
     through my apartment

21:49.409 --> 21:52.943
and giving away all the things
 I don't use to charities.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.146
It just feels so
      good to pare down.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.280
- Well that's very admirable.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.149
- Well, I guess
      Vikki George isn't

21:58.184 --> 22:00.051
the only one you admire.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.185
I'll see you later.

22:02.388 --> 22:04.155
- Where are you going?

22:04.190 --> 22:05.323
- Shopping.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.857
I may have gone a
     little too overboard

22:06.893 --> 22:07.925
giving things away.

22:08.995 --> 22:09.860
- Ah.

22:12.131 --> 22:14.832
- I need to make a reservation
 with a personal shopper.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.300
The Mayoral Gala is coming up

22:16.336 --> 22:17.802
and I need to look my best.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.089
- Hi.

22:39.592 --> 22:40.257
Me again.

22:40.293 --> 22:41.659
- Did you have an appointment

22:41.694 --> 22:42.360
or do you just not
      believe in them?

22:42.395 --> 22:43.894
- Oh come on, we're old friends.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.196
Friends don't let
      friends appoint.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.764
Besides, I brought
      you something.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.066
And this one doesn't
     require as much

22:49.102 --> 22:50.468
water as the other one.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.737
And it can keep this
     little guy company.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.006
- What are you doing
     here Ms. George?

22:56.042 --> 22:58.342
I assume it's not to
    bring me another plant.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.810
- Well, first of all,
     I think I've asked

22:59.846 --> 23:01.245
you to call me Vikki.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.213
Second, you just like to get

23:02.248 --> 23:03.581
right down to business don't ya?

23:03.616 --> 23:05.082
Okay, fine.

23:05.118 --> 23:05.983
Here you go.

23:07.954 --> 23:10.354
Concrete proof.

23:10.390 --> 23:11.455
- Proof of what?

23:11.491 --> 23:13.724
- Proof of what the garden
  means to the community.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.393
That's a petition
      to save the garden

23:15.428 --> 23:17.595
and not cold-heartedly
     rip out peoples plants

23:17.630 --> 23:18.829
and destroy peoples dreams.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.064
AKA, build your condos.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.966
'Cause I've got over
     1,000 signatures,

23:22.001 --> 23:23.834
which means I don't
     think your condos

23:23.870 --> 23:25.536
are gonna go over very
  well with the neighborhood

23:25.571 --> 23:28.005
which is really something
  you should consider.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.340
- 1,000 plus signatures.

23:29.375 --> 23:30.408
You did this pretty quickly.

23:30.443 --> 23:33.110
- Well it's easy when
  you believe in something.

23:33.146 --> 23:34.678
And I believe in this garden.

23:37.717 --> 23:38.983
- I'm impressed Ms. George.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.819
- Oh, Vikki.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.521
- Vikki, right.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.424
Shows a lot of...

23:47.860 --> 23:48.626
- Gumption?

23:48.661 --> 23:50.027
- Gumption.

23:50.062 --> 23:50.795
Yes.

23:50.830 --> 23:51.962
I like that word.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.264
You don't hear it very often.

23:53.299 --> 23:55.266
- It was one of my
     father's favorites.

23:58.571 --> 23:59.703
So?

23:59.739 --> 24:02.573
- So, I'm impressed
     with your gumption.

24:02.608 --> 24:06.110
Impressed but not convinced.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.678
See, even 10,000 signatures

24:07.713 --> 24:09.413
wouldn't change my mind.

24:09.449 --> 24:12.483
- But we have the whole
 neighborhood standing with us.

24:12.518 --> 24:15.686
- It's like I said before,
 it's business not personal.

24:16.422 --> 24:19.056
Also, if I change my mind

24:19.091 --> 24:20.891
it impacts a whole
      slew of people.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.061
- This isn't over.

24:24.997 --> 24:25.863
I'll be back.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.632
- I assume without
      an appointment.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.534
I look forward to it.

24:30.570 --> 24:31.435
- Well you shouldn't,

24:31.504 --> 24:32.870
because when I put
     my mind to something,

24:32.905 --> 24:34.338
it usually happens.

24:34.373 --> 24:36.640
- Well when I set my mind to
 something it happens as well.

24:36.676 --> 24:39.543
- Well good, then we
  have one thing in common.

24:39.579 --> 24:42.246
- Yes, but that means
    we have an impasse too.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.684
- But there's a way
     over any impasse.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.063
- 1,000 signatures.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.232
She's really something.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.236
Don't look at me like that.

25:05.905 --> 25:08.739
- Wow, I guess it's official.

25:08.774 --> 25:11.909
We're being evicted by
     Devine Construction.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.678
We have to be out in
     less than a month.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.046
That's right after Garden Walk.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.715
- A lot can happen in a month.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.653
So what are you
     gonna do sweetheart?

25:22.688 --> 25:23.587
- I don't know.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.124
I mean, I guess the
     only thing I can do,

25:28.427 --> 25:30.961
show Chace Devine just how
  much fight I have in me.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.964
- You are your
      father's daughter.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.105
- What do you
     think dad would do?

25:42.775 --> 25:44.141
- Sleep on it.

25:44.176 --> 25:45.142
It'll come to you.

25:46.412 --> 25:47.578
You've got the drive,

25:47.613 --> 25:49.280
all you need is a plan.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.116
- A plan to stop Chace Devine.

25:58.824 --> 26:00.391
I know exactly what to do.

26:10.503 --> 26:11.802
- Hi.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.070
I see the press is here.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.538
- Yup, from all
      the local papers.

26:14.574 --> 26:15.839
We even got TV.

26:15.875 --> 26:16.974
- Great.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.142
We need all the good
     press we can get.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.945
We're breaking ground on the
 garden property next month

26:20.980 --> 26:23.647
and I don't want any
 controversy around my name.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.549
Fingers crossed, we
     can have both crews

26:25.585 --> 26:26.817
working full-time.

26:26.852 --> 26:28.385
- I think we can handle that.

26:28.421 --> 26:29.119
- Yeah.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.321
- You about ready?

26:30.356 --> 26:31.388
We don't wanna keep
     them waiting too long.

26:31.424 --> 26:32.823
- As ready as I'll ever be.

26:35.261 --> 26:38.095
Thank you all for
      coming out witness

26:38.130 --> 26:40.931
Devine Construction's
     20th build.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.666
It's gonna be a
      landmark property

26:42.702 --> 26:44.034
that we think will bring

26:44.070 --> 26:47.538
a sleek, modern look
     to Saint Petersburg.

26:47.573 --> 26:49.073
- Grow
     flowers, not towers!

26:49.108 --> 26:50.774
Grow flowers, not towers!

26:50.810 --> 26:52.509
Grow flowers, not towers!

26:52.545 --> 26:53.844
Grow flowers, not towers!

26:53.879 --> 26:56.246
- Change is hard.
 - Grow flowers, not towers!

26:56.282 --> 26:58.015
- Grow
     flowers, not towers!

26:58.050 --> 26:59.683
Grow flowers, not towers!

26:59.719 --> 27:00.517
Grow flowers, not towers!

27:00.553 --> 27:01.785
- Guys, guys!

27:03.756 --> 27:04.822
- What is all this?

27:04.857 --> 27:07.324
- Oh, this is for your office.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.326
You know, I didn't
    want come empty-handed.

27:09.362 --> 27:10.194
- You're leading a protest.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.296
- It doesn't mean
      I have to be rude.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.302
- What is it gonna take
    for you to stop this?

27:18.337 --> 27:21.271
- You, saving our
      Community Garden!

27:23.242 --> 27:25.442
- I already told you Vikki,
 that's not gonna happen.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.810
- Well then this
      isn't gonna stop.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.513
Because I told you
    that I was gonna fight.

27:29.548 --> 27:30.714
- Even if you can't win?

27:30.750 --> 27:32.016
- Not so sure about that.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.318
I mean, just how much bad press

27:34.353 --> 27:36.253
can you afford Chace Devine?

27:36.288 --> 27:39.423
- Excuse me, but are you
 available for an interview?

27:39.458 --> 27:42.192
- I would love to
      do an interview!

27:42.228 --> 27:42.893
- Can I get your name?

27:42.928 --> 27:44.762
- Yes, my name is Vikki George

27:44.797 --> 27:47.998
and I represent the Community
 Garden in Saint Petersburg.

27:48.034 --> 27:50.300
Last week Mr. Devine
     here bought our garden

27:50.336 --> 27:52.836
in an attempt to tear it
    down and build condos.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.439
So today, we're
      here to stop him.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.343
- Not only is she
     stealing my publicity,

27:59.378 --> 28:02.012
but she's making me
     out to be the bad guy.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.614
- Well aren't you the bad guy?

28:03.649 --> 28:04.515
- No.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.117
It's not a black
        and white issue.

28:08.521 --> 28:11.789
People need housing in this
 city and we provide that.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.557
Saint Petersburg is
    growing at a rapid pace

28:13.592 --> 28:15.325
and if housing
     doesn't grow with it,

28:15.361 --> 28:18.629
the prices are gonna
  become unaffordable and...

28:21.467 --> 28:22.533
You really think
        I'm the bad guy?

28:22.568 --> 28:24.068
- You're taking
      away their garden.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.804
- To give people
        a place to live.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.572
- Okay, whatever you say.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.746
- Do you realize that
     giving people jobs,

28:35.781 --> 28:39.383
providing housing, it's
  why I do what I do Marta.

28:39.418 --> 28:42.986
- Well, maybe you could
    do something different.

28:43.022 --> 28:45.756
You inspired me to
     change for the better.

28:45.791 --> 28:47.624
Maybe it's time
      you make a change.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.331
- You guys, listen.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.400
I know that everybody
     has seen the headlines

28:56.435 --> 28:58.001
and that was a great start,

28:58.037 --> 29:00.771
but that's all
      that was, a start.

29:00.806 --> 29:03.040
Having the public on our side
 is not our ultimate goal.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.508
Right now, there is one man

29:04.543 --> 29:06.677
and one man alone
     who controls our fate

29:06.712 --> 29:08.712
and that is Chace Devine.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.447
- So what can we do?

29:10.483 --> 29:12.516
- We make it so he
      can't ignore us.

29:12.551 --> 29:15.519
We have to keep infusing
ourselves into community events

29:15.554 --> 29:17.721
so he sees how
    important we truly are.

29:17.757 --> 29:19.723
- What about our
    Annual Ladybug Release?

29:19.759 --> 29:21.191
- What do you mean?

29:21.227 --> 29:22.259
- What if we open it up
  to the whole neighborhood?

29:22.294 --> 29:23.961
- That's a great idea.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.295
That's a great idea!

29:25.331 --> 29:26.463
We make it a true event.

29:26.499 --> 29:29.466
We invite everyone,
    including Chace Devine.

29:29.502 --> 29:31.935
We show him the kinds of
    things that we do here.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.505
Once he sees the community
 part of the Community Garden,

29:34.540 --> 29:36.640
he's gonna have second thoughts
about shutting us down.

29:36.675 --> 29:37.808
Serena, you're a genius.

29:46.519 --> 29:48.051
- Yes, I saw the news,

29:48.087 --> 29:50.854
but it's gonna blow over
    in a week, I promise.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.589
We proceed on schedule.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.858
The public has a short
     attention span but...

29:55.961 --> 29:57.861
I'm gonna have to call you back.

29:58.597 --> 29:59.263
Vikki George.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.331
- Chace Devine, this is for you.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.032
It's an olive branch.

30:02.067 --> 30:03.133
Actually, it's an olive tree,

30:03.169 --> 30:04.001
but I think you catch my drift.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.235
It's for your office.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.303
You could really use
     some green in there.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.272
- I'd love to stay and
 chat, but I have a meeting.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.273
- Oh great, I'll walk with you.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.008
- My own personal escort.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.176
- Something like that.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.477
First of all I want to apologize

30:13.512 --> 30:15.145
for hijacking the
    groundbreaking ceremony.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.247
- It was just a bump in
    the road, but thank you.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.682
- And ask a favor.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.150
- You have a favor.

30:20.186 --> 30:20.984
- Yes.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.319
So, we're hosting an event.

30:22.354 --> 30:23.487
A ladybug release.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.022
And I'd really like
     for you to come.

30:25.057 --> 30:27.324
See how important the
 garden is to the community.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.193
- I don't get it.

30:29.228 --> 30:30.894
Why are you doing this?

30:30.930 --> 30:34.064
Can't you just plant your
  flowers somewhere else?

30:34.099 --> 30:36.567
- This garden was
      started by my dad.

30:36.602 --> 30:39.002
It was his passion
    project before he died.

30:41.307 --> 30:42.406
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

30:42.441 --> 30:43.607
- It's okay.

30:43.642 --> 30:44.575
He died three years ago,

30:44.610 --> 30:45.709
which is both a long time

30:45.744 --> 30:48.011
and also no time at all.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.480
It was just really
      important to him

30:50.516 --> 30:52.683
that everybody have a
     little piece of land

30:52.718 --> 30:53.483
to call their own.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.651
Pride of ownership.

30:54.687 --> 30:56.220
That's what he used to say.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.724
- You know, my dad passed
  away when I was young.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.427
It forced me to
      grow up real fast.

31:04.763 --> 31:06.296
I had to take care of my mom.

31:06.332 --> 31:09.900
Everything I did was to keep
 her happy and cared for.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.770
She passed away last year.

31:13.806 --> 31:14.872
- I'm so sorry.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.741
- There's a lot we don't
    know about each other.

31:18.744 --> 31:19.610
- You never know,

31:19.645 --> 31:21.845
in another life we
    might have been friends.

31:21.881 --> 31:22.779
- You never know.

31:25.684 --> 31:26.783
Tell you what,

31:27.586 --> 31:30.520
I can't guarantee that
     I can make it to the?

31:30.556 --> 31:31.355
- Ladybug release.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.556
- Ladybug release.

31:32.591 --> 31:33.357
I've got a really
      packed schedule,

31:33.425 --> 31:35.626
but I can guarantee
     that I'll try.

31:36.762 --> 31:38.896
Hopefully that's good enough.

31:38.931 --> 31:39.663
- It'll have to be.

31:39.698 --> 31:41.398
Thank you for trying.

31:41.433 --> 31:42.833
- Oh, and thank you for,

31:43.736 --> 31:45.269
for your olive branch.

31:45.938 --> 31:47.571
I'll add it to my collection.

31:47.606 --> 31:48.438
- Good.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.575
I'll make a gardener
     out of you yet.

31:51.610 --> 31:52.809
- I wouldn't count on it!

32:24.777 --> 32:27.010
- Look, look at this one.

32:33.686 --> 32:35.652
- Ah, you can do this, right?

32:35.688 --> 32:36.887
But she likes you.

32:36.922 --> 32:39.856
Let's just walk
      in and say hello.

32:41.593 --> 32:42.459
Nope.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.696
- Are you here for
     the ladybug release?

32:45.731 --> 32:46.563
- I guess.

32:46.598 --> 32:47.331
I guess I am.

32:47.366 --> 32:48.532
- Well we better hurry.

32:49.868 --> 32:53.170
You know, this is a
     historical occasion.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.771
This could be the
     last ladybug release

32:54.807 --> 32:56.473
before that horrible
     real estate developer

32:56.508 --> 32:57.708
takes over the garden.

33:02.348 --> 33:03.347
Are you coming in?

33:04.650 --> 33:07.184
- You go ahead, I'll
     be in in a minute.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.425
- What do you think it means?

34:21.460 --> 34:22.859
I think it means that
     he's warming up to me.

34:22.895 --> 34:24.995
I mean warming up to the
  idea of saving the garden.

34:25.030 --> 34:27.330
Why else would he
      get me a plant?

34:27.366 --> 34:29.199
- Maybe he likes you.

34:32.670 --> 34:33.335
- No way!

34:33.371 --> 34:34.938
- Oh he definitely likes you.

34:34.973 --> 34:36.572
- There is not a chance.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.108
- Why else would he
     bring you a plant?

34:38.143 --> 34:39.076
He's flirting with you.

34:39.110 --> 34:41.078
- He is not flirting with me.

34:41.112 --> 34:43.612
He is not flirting
      with me, okay?

34:43.649 --> 34:46.583
He is mister dress to
     the nines business man

34:46.618 --> 34:48.518
and I'm, me.

34:48.554 --> 34:51.388
You know, I like to think of
 myself as happy and carefree,

34:51.422 --> 34:53.723
and I don't think those two
 words are in his vocabulary.

34:53.759 --> 34:54.858
- I don't know.

34:54.893 --> 34:57.027
But you know what they
    say, opposites attract.

34:57.062 --> 34:58.695
Besides, are you
     really so different?

34:58.730 --> 35:00.831
I mean you're both
    very determined people.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.632
Well maybe he's
      attracted to that.

35:02.668 --> 35:05.168
- That may be, but
    yeah, we are different.

35:05.204 --> 35:05.969
Very different.

35:06.004 --> 35:07.137
Too different.

35:07.172 --> 35:09.106
Besides, have you
     seen his girlfriend?

35:09.141 --> 35:10.006
- He has a girlfriend?

35:10.042 --> 35:11.208
- Does he have a girlfriend?

35:11.243 --> 35:12.976
I mean she's so
     gorgeous that you can

35:13.011 --> 35:14.544
hear the whiplash
     when the heads turn

35:14.580 --> 35:16.046
when she walks in the room.

35:16.081 --> 35:18.782
- Aye, but is she determined?

35:18.817 --> 35:20.317
- You are infuriating.

35:20.352 --> 35:21.251
This conversation's over.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.519
- Okay, okay!

35:22.554 --> 35:24.287
He may not like you,

35:24.323 --> 35:26.056
but I know you

35:26.091 --> 35:27.824
and I think you like him.

35:27.860 --> 35:28.992
Just a little bit.

35:36.602 --> 35:37.634
- Come in!

35:37.669 --> 35:39.536
- You had a delivery come in.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.004
- Oh, thanks Ilya.

35:42.674 --> 35:45.475
Those are the documents
    for the garden property.

35:47.146 --> 35:48.011
Hey Ilya.

35:48.947 --> 35:51.114
Have you been
     following this whole

35:51.150 --> 35:52.516
Community Garden mess?

35:52.551 --> 35:53.283
- Of course.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.885
It's part of my job.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.486
- What's your opinion on it?

35:56.522 --> 35:58.155
Your honest opinion now.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.824
Pretend you're not
     talking to your boss.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.325
- My honest opinion?

36:02.361 --> 36:03.093
- Mm hmm.

36:03.128 --> 36:05.629
- Well, I'm a gardener.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.831
And gardens have always
    been special to me.

36:07.866 --> 36:10.300
They're soothing, meditative.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.068
Besides, there's no
     greater feeling than

36:12.104 --> 36:14.070
caring for something and
    watching it flourish.

36:14.106 --> 36:15.972
- That's how I feel
     about my buildings.

36:16.008 --> 36:17.741
Not only do they provide jobs

36:17.776 --> 36:19.142
for the people who
      construct them,

36:19.178 --> 36:21.478
but the construction themselves

36:22.681 --> 36:23.647
become housing.

36:25.083 --> 36:26.183
Homes.

36:28.020 --> 36:31.154
Plus, I'm really proud of them.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.156
- Well, maybe you
      can show her that.

36:34.960 --> 36:35.692
- Who?

36:35.727 --> 36:36.860
Vikki George?

36:36.895 --> 36:38.195
- Maybe if she can see
    from your point of view

36:38.230 --> 36:39.863
she'd appreciate it.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.367
Would you like me to take
  care of those for you?

36:44.403 --> 36:45.335
- No.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.170
No, they're my plants.

36:48.307 --> 36:49.806
I'm responsible for them.

36:55.314 --> 36:56.146
Ilya,

36:57.049 --> 36:59.583
you just gave me a great idea.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.186
Thank you.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.087
You're right.

37:10.596 --> 37:11.394
- Vikki!

37:11.430 --> 37:12.162
- Yeah.

37:12.197 --> 37:13.230
- Vikki!

37:13.265 --> 37:13.930
- Yeah.

37:13.966 --> 37:14.764
- You have a visitor.

37:14.800 --> 37:15.532
- Who is it?

37:15.567 --> 37:17.133
- He's coming in now.

37:17.169 --> 37:18.868
- Chace Devine.

37:18.904 --> 37:19.603
- Vikki George.

37:19.638 --> 37:20.437
- Didn't expect this.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.204
You, to see you.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.239
For you to come here.

37:22.274 --> 37:23.139
You know what I mean.

37:23.175 --> 37:24.507
This is my best friend Anna.

37:24.543 --> 37:25.275
- Oh.

37:25.310 --> 37:26.042
- Hi.

37:26.078 --> 37:27.244
- Please to meet you.

37:27.279 --> 37:28.912
Though, if you're part
    of the garden community,

37:28.947 --> 37:31.514
I'm sure I'm not your
  favorite person right now.

37:31.550 --> 37:34.284
- You're not not my
  favorite person right now.

37:34.319 --> 37:36.186
Especially if you're
     here for the reason

37:36.221 --> 37:37.254
I think you're here for.

37:37.289 --> 37:38.221
- Okay.

37:38.257 --> 37:38.955
- I'll go.

37:38.991 --> 37:39.756
I'll be by the register.

37:39.791 --> 37:40.724
- That's a good idea.

37:42.728 --> 37:45.161
I'm not even gonna
      begin to try to

37:45.197 --> 37:47.631
decipher for you what she meant.

37:47.666 --> 37:48.665
- It's okay.

37:48.700 --> 37:49.566
- Okay.

37:50.535 --> 37:52.035
- So, what are you working on?

37:52.070 --> 37:54.571
- Well, it's tulip season so...

37:54.606 --> 37:56.139
You wanna smell 'em?

37:56.174 --> 37:57.040
- Sure.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.011
It smells like spring?

38:02.014 --> 38:03.713
- I know, most people
  think they have no scent,

38:03.749 --> 38:05.615
but I think they
      smell like heaven.

38:06.385 --> 38:07.150
For you.

38:07.185 --> 38:08.151
- What?

38:08.186 --> 38:08.985
- Yes, for you.

38:09.021 --> 38:10.153
- No.

38:10.188 --> 38:12.188
At least let me
      pay for this one.

38:12.224 --> 38:13.256
You're running a business here.

38:13.292 --> 38:13.957
- It's a gift.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.025
Besides, I've seen your office,

38:15.093 --> 38:17.494
we both know you need those
 tulips more than I do.

38:17.529 --> 38:18.495
- Okay, thank you.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.831
So, I'm here to...

38:22.934 --> 38:24.134
Are you free today?

38:24.169 --> 38:25.769
There's something
      I wanna show you.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.837
- Well, we are pretty busy.

38:27.873 --> 38:28.772
- Oh.

38:33.779 --> 38:35.312
- But yeah, I guess
     I could sneak away.

38:35.347 --> 38:36.413
What'd ya have in mind?

38:40.585 --> 38:43.453
- Actually, we're running
 two months ahead of schedule.

38:43.488 --> 38:44.220
- Really?

38:44.256 --> 38:45.855
- We're efficient.

38:45.891 --> 38:48.224
It's something
      I'm very proud of.

38:48.260 --> 38:50.460
Besides, we've got about
    75 people on this site,

38:50.495 --> 38:52.729
another 20 back at the office.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.297
It's quite a lot of
     jobs on this build.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.766
- Mr. Devine, the
  foreman's looking for you.

38:57.569 --> 38:58.735
- Thanks Mark.

38:58.770 --> 38:59.302
Hey, there's someone
     I want you to meet.

38:59.338 --> 39:00.737
This is Vikki George.

39:00.772 --> 39:02.172
- Nice to meet you.

39:02.207 --> 39:04.474
- A new friend of Chace
 Devine is a friend of mine.

39:04.509 --> 39:05.675
- How's the family?

39:05.711 --> 39:07.310
- Ah they're doing
     great, really great.

39:07.346 --> 39:09.979
He's always asking
      about my family.

39:10.015 --> 39:13.416
You see, a couple of
    years ago I lost my job.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.751
I met Mr. Devine,

39:14.786 --> 39:16.786
he personally hired me
     on his regular crew.

39:16.822 --> 39:18.555
- Mark's being very generous.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.490
You're one of the
     best employees I got.

39:20.525 --> 39:21.991
We couldn't do the
    work we do without you.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.427
- Honestly, if he wasn't able
 to keep our crew working,

39:24.463 --> 39:25.929
we'd all be out of a job.

39:25.964 --> 39:27.230
But enough chit-chat about that,

39:27.265 --> 39:29.199
this building isn't
     gonna build itself.

39:29.234 --> 39:30.500
Chace, don't forget
     about the foreman.

39:30.535 --> 39:31.634
- You got it.

39:31.670 --> 39:32.969
- Very nice to
     meet you Ms. George.

39:33.004 --> 39:34.170
- Yes, very nice to
     meet you as well.

39:34.206 --> 39:37.173
Wow, I had no idea you were
responsible for so many people.

39:37.209 --> 39:38.641
- It's not just
     about the buildings

39:38.677 --> 39:40.744
it's about how they get here.

39:40.779 --> 39:43.279
And the source of pride
 they are to the architects,

39:43.315 --> 39:44.414
and the construction workers,

39:44.449 --> 39:47.283
and everyone else involved.

39:47.319 --> 39:48.151
- Hm.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.786
You know, I have to
     admit that I never

39:49.821 --> 39:51.488
even considered any of that.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.657
- Hey, what are you
     doing right now?

39:55.293 --> 39:57.494
It's a beautiful spring day,

39:58.397 --> 39:59.529
how about lunch?

40:00.432 --> 40:01.564
- Together?

40:03.602 --> 40:04.334
Okay.

40:04.369 --> 40:05.769
- Yeah?

40:05.804 --> 40:06.569
- Sure.

40:06.605 --> 40:07.971
- Great.

40:08.006 --> 40:10.039
I'll make a
    reservation at Shiro's.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.877
- I think if we're
      gonna have lunch,

40:13.912 --> 40:15.378
we should do it on my terms.

40:17.215 --> 40:19.883
I am really glad you
  showed me that build site.

40:20.886 --> 40:22.652
- I just wanted
      to open your eyes,

40:22.687 --> 40:24.220
help you see that
      I'm not a monster.

40:24.256 --> 40:26.456
- I never thought
     you were a monster.

40:27.459 --> 40:28.858
Alright, maybe
      just a little bit.

40:28.894 --> 40:31.394
Like a small
     corporate troglodyte.

40:32.364 --> 40:35.165
But can I ask you a
     question, seriously.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.766
How come you didn't come
    to the ladybug release?

40:36.802 --> 40:38.334
- Oh it didn't seem appropriate

40:38.370 --> 40:40.870
with me being the one
    taking away the garden.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.740
I didn't wanna seem
     like a villain.

40:45.444 --> 40:48.077
Hey, if I could figure out
  a way to save the garden

40:48.113 --> 40:49.279
and put up my building, I would.

40:49.347 --> 40:51.781
But as it stands, there's too
 many people depending on me.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.183
- Okay.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.284
But I am gonna keep
  trying to change your mind

40:54.319 --> 40:55.385
because I have a lot of people

40:55.420 --> 40:56.352
depending on me as well.

40:56.388 --> 40:58.455
- Well, we'll just have
    to agree to disagree.

40:58.490 --> 40:59.823
- For now.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.224
But I'm pretty sure
    you're gonna come around

41:01.259 --> 41:02.826
to my way of
     thinking eventually.

41:02.861 --> 41:04.994
- I don't know about that.

41:05.030 --> 41:06.062
- Very persuasive.

41:09.534 --> 41:10.633
No way.

41:15.073 --> 41:16.306
It's a four leaf clover.

41:16.341 --> 41:17.407
- Wow.

41:17.442 --> 41:18.374
- You know what this
     means don't you?

41:18.410 --> 41:19.375
Good luck is coming our way.

41:19.411 --> 41:20.577
- Let me see.

41:23.148 --> 41:24.914
So when does the
        good luck start?

41:25.917 --> 41:27.717
- Who knows, maybe
      it already has.

41:27.752 --> 41:29.319
- No, what does that
    mean for the two of us?

41:29.354 --> 41:30.753
We want different things.

41:33.058 --> 41:33.923
- Do we?

41:35.961 --> 41:36.793
I just mean--

41:38.363 --> 41:39.562
- Ah!

41:39.598 --> 41:40.363
Okay.

41:40.398 --> 41:41.831
- Oh no.

41:41.867 --> 41:43.099
- Maybe we should--

41:43.134 --> 41:43.967
- Yeah,
 no, we should go.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.201
- I've got a meeting.

41:45.237 --> 41:46.236
- I mean I have to get
     back to the nursery.

41:46.271 --> 41:47.103
- Yeah.

41:48.373 --> 41:49.172
- Rain.

41:51.076 --> 41:51.875
Got it.

41:54.779 --> 41:56.145
- Thanks for lunch Vikki.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.615
It's always an adventure.

42:01.553 --> 42:02.785
- It was my pleasure.

42:04.422 --> 42:06.823
This looks so nice, thanks
  for having me to dinner.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.458
- Oh we always love having you.

42:08.493 --> 42:11.127
- He got the recipe
     from Ms. Hewitt.

42:11.162 --> 42:13.897
- Oh, but don't tell her I'm
 using Mr. Boyle's peppers.

42:13.932 --> 42:15.231
- My lips are sealed.

42:15.267 --> 42:15.965
- Good.

42:16.001 --> 42:16.766
I hope you like spicy.

42:16.801 --> 42:17.634
- Yeah.

42:17.669 --> 42:19.035
- Speaking of spicy,

42:19.070 --> 42:21.337
tell me about your
    date with Chace Devine.

42:21.373 --> 42:22.539
- It wasn't a date.

42:22.574 --> 42:24.240
- You had lunch.

42:24.276 --> 42:25.241
A picnic lunch.

42:25.277 --> 42:26.476
- Half a picnic lunch.

42:26.511 --> 42:28.578
There was a rain delay,
    so half a picnic.

42:28.613 --> 42:30.547
- Still, half.

42:31.550 --> 42:32.715
- It was interesting.

42:33.752 --> 42:35.018
You know, I guess
      I never realized

42:35.053 --> 42:36.619
how many people are
     behind the scenes

42:36.655 --> 42:37.887
of a man like Chace Devine.

42:37.923 --> 42:39.222
I guess this whole
      time I've been

42:39.257 --> 42:41.224
so focused on him
      being the bad guy,

42:41.259 --> 42:44.160
I never thought about things
 from his point of view.

42:44.195 --> 42:45.495
- He opened your eyes.

42:45.530 --> 42:46.696
That's cool.

42:46.731 --> 42:48.731
- But does that
      change your mind?

42:48.767 --> 42:50.266
- What do you mean?

42:50.302 --> 42:53.269
- Well I mean, what about
 the people from the garden?

42:53.305 --> 42:54.804
Are they just supposed
     to abandon their

42:54.839 --> 42:56.472
little spot of
     green, their plots,

42:56.508 --> 42:57.440
their piece of the community

42:57.475 --> 43:01.044
just because a developer
    wants to build condos?

43:01.079 --> 43:02.111
- Don't be crazy.

43:02.147 --> 43:03.546
Vikki would never abandon
  the Community Garden.

43:03.582 --> 43:05.081
- Of course not.

43:05.116 --> 43:07.517
If we were to let go of things
 like the Community Garden,

43:07.552 --> 43:09.819
we'll have no community left.

43:09.854 --> 43:12.555
Chace may have opened my
    eyes to his perspective,

43:12.591 --> 43:14.390
but there is nothing
     that will make

43:14.426 --> 43:15.725
me let this garden go.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.393
- I'm glad you didn't budge.

43:17.429 --> 43:20.463
And you know you have the
support of the entire community.

43:20.498 --> 43:23.099
But mostly, your
     best friends support.

43:24.102 --> 43:24.934
- Thank you.

43:26.204 --> 43:28.738
And don't worry, I am
  never gonna stop fighting.

43:28.773 --> 43:29.639
No matter what.

43:49.628 --> 43:51.894
Diane, what are you doing?

43:51.930 --> 43:54.230
- Vikki, I'm so sorry.

43:54.265 --> 43:55.665
My friend Tim is
     letting me use some

43:55.700 --> 43:56.766
space in his garden

43:56.801 --> 43:58.635
and it's a guarantee.

43:58.670 --> 44:00.370
It's not going anywhere.

44:00.405 --> 44:02.405
Please forgive me.

44:02.440 --> 44:03.306
- Of course.

44:09.347 --> 44:11.648
Hey, Serena what's going on?

44:11.683 --> 44:13.016
- A couple of the
  gardeners are threatening

44:13.051 --> 44:14.951
to drop out of the
      Community Garden.

44:14.986 --> 44:16.019
They see the inevitable coming

44:16.087 --> 44:18.287
and they don't want to
 wait until the last minute.

44:18.323 --> 44:19.822
It's only a few
     weeks until we have

44:19.858 --> 44:20.990
to be out of the garden.

44:21.026 --> 44:22.291
- Well, no, that's
     not necessarily true.

44:22.327 --> 44:23.793
And you know, it's fine.

44:23.828 --> 44:26.095
I'll just call some
    people on the wait list.

44:26.131 --> 44:28.297
- Vikki, people don't
     wanna join the garden

44:28.333 --> 44:29.932
if they know it's gonna go away.

44:29.968 --> 44:31.300
No one wants to
     commit until they know

44:31.336 --> 44:32.835
the garden's future is decided.

44:32.871 --> 44:34.203
- Well I don't know
    what I'm supposed to do.

44:34.239 --> 44:35.104
Garden Walk is in two weeks

44:35.140 --> 44:36.773
and there's no way
     we're gonna win with

44:36.808 --> 44:38.441
a bunch of bald
     patches everywhere.

44:38.476 --> 44:40.443
It's gotta be full and vibrant.

44:42.313 --> 44:45.415
- Don't worry, we
     will rally the troops.

44:45.450 --> 44:48.284
The garden will be ready for
 the Garden Walk Festival.

44:48.319 --> 44:49.786
- Thank you Serena.

44:49.821 --> 44:51.320
- Yeah.

44:53.124 --> 44:55.158
- What am I gonna do with you?

44:58.530 --> 45:00.663
Mr. Boyle, good afternoon.

45:00.699 --> 45:01.798
Can I help you?

45:01.833 --> 45:03.366
- Well Vikki, I
     need to approach you

45:03.401 --> 45:05.068
with a delicate matter.

45:05.103 --> 45:06.002
- Shoot.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.437
- I wanna move to a new plot.

45:07.472 --> 45:08.538
- Really?

45:08.573 --> 45:10.306
Now with Garden Walk
    just around the corner?

45:10.341 --> 45:13.342
I've already got one
  giant bald patch to fill.

45:13.378 --> 45:15.311
- I realize the
     timing isn't the best,

45:15.346 --> 45:16.879
but I need to get
     away from Ms. Hewitt.

45:16.915 --> 45:19.515
She's too, distracting.

45:22.654 --> 45:23.586
- Distracting?

45:23.621 --> 45:24.754
- Yes distracting.

45:24.789 --> 45:27.423
Namely her tomatoes
     are distracting.

45:27.459 --> 45:29.225
- And how are her
     tomatoes distracting?

45:29.260 --> 45:31.260
- Oh they're an A-list
     vegetable Vikki.

45:31.296 --> 45:32.295
Which is malarkey.

45:32.330 --> 45:36.499
Since technically,
 technically they're a fruit.

45:36.534 --> 45:39.669
Now how are my peppers supposed
to compete with her fruit?

45:39.704 --> 45:42.472
- Well, the good news is,
  it's not a competition.

45:42.507 --> 45:44.240
- Ah, life's a
      competition Vikki.

45:44.275 --> 45:46.476
And at the moment,
     my delightful peppers

45:46.511 --> 45:48.711
are playing second
     banana to her fruit.

45:48.747 --> 45:50.379
- Maybe if you stopped
     calling them fruits.

45:50.415 --> 45:51.581
- Ah, can't do that.

45:51.616 --> 45:52.849
Gotta keep an edge up.

45:52.884 --> 45:54.817
- Okay, Mr. Boyle, I
     will think about it,

45:54.853 --> 45:57.186
but this new plot would
    have to be eye catching.

45:57.222 --> 45:58.621
I can't replace a pepper patch

45:58.656 --> 46:00.590
that is flourishing
     with a brand new one

46:00.625 --> 46:02.925
that would just be
      getting started.

46:02.961 --> 46:04.727
- I'll plant zucchinis!

46:04.763 --> 46:06.195
- How is that different?

46:06.231 --> 46:07.396
- Come on, zucchinis!

46:07.432 --> 46:09.198
What could be more eye
    catching than zucchinis?

46:09.234 --> 46:11.734
Because they sprout flowers!

46:11.770 --> 46:12.902
- I will think about it.

46:12.937 --> 46:14.337
Mr. Boyle I promise.

46:14.372 --> 46:15.304
- Well you better think quick

46:15.340 --> 46:17.940
because Garden Walk is
    just around the corner.

46:21.146 --> 46:22.879
- Don't I know it.

46:28.720 --> 46:29.552
Hi.

46:42.534 --> 46:44.133
From the ground up.

46:50.675 --> 46:52.642
Hi, Chace Devine's
      voicemail please.

46:55.113 --> 46:57.013
Chace, hi, it's Vikki.

46:57.048 --> 46:59.382
Remember when I went
     to your build site?

46:59.417 --> 47:01.050
Well it's your turn
     for a field trip.

47:01.085 --> 47:03.085
And I tell you what, I
    will call your assistant

47:03.121 --> 47:04.453
and make an appointment
    because I know

47:04.489 --> 47:06.455
how much you love those.

47:06.491 --> 47:10.226
Oh, and if you own
 anything that's not a suit,

47:11.329 --> 47:12.161
wear it.

47:13.765 --> 47:14.630
Two trowels.

47:15.633 --> 47:16.899
- Two trowels check.

47:16.935 --> 47:18.568
Two dibbers.

47:18.603 --> 47:19.735
Two pruners.

47:20.772 --> 47:22.205
Two people.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.941
- I do not like your
    tone, this is business.

47:24.976 --> 47:27.410
- And I think you mean business.

47:27.445 --> 47:30.479
- Anna, I'm just doing
    this to save the garden.

47:30.515 --> 47:32.048
- Mm hm.

47:32.083 --> 47:32.982
- Am I interrupting?

47:33.017 --> 47:34.383
- Oh, no.

47:34.419 --> 47:35.785
We were just getting
  ready for our field trip.

47:35.820 --> 47:37.520
- Just getting ready.

47:38.256 --> 47:41.023
- You look great in not a suit.

47:41.059 --> 47:42.258
It's suits you.

47:44.429 --> 47:45.294
- Thank you.

47:46.297 --> 47:47.096
I don't usually
      have the occasion

47:47.131 --> 47:47.797
to wear not a suit.

47:47.832 --> 47:49.565
- Well, you do today because I

47:49.601 --> 47:51.033
am gonna teach
      you how to garden.

47:51.069 --> 47:52.535
- This is gonna
      be a long lesson.

47:52.570 --> 47:54.537
I don't know the first
     thing about gardening.

47:54.572 --> 47:55.972
- Yeah you do.

47:56.007 --> 47:56.873
Because the first thing is
 just knowing what you like.

47:56.908 --> 47:57.773
So,

47:58.676 --> 48:01.477
step into my parlor and tell me.

48:01.512 --> 48:02.745
What do you like?

48:02.780 --> 48:04.313
Just take a look
     around and see which

48:04.349 --> 48:06.816
flowers speak to you
    and we'll go from there.

48:09.454 --> 48:10.253
- These.

48:10.288 --> 48:11.387
- Yeah?

48:11.422 --> 48:12.555
- My mom would
      always plant them.

48:12.590 --> 48:13.923
- See, you've got
    gardening in your blood.

48:13.958 --> 48:15.491
Trust me, you're
     gonna be a natural.

48:15.526 --> 48:17.426
So, these will be
      the centerpiece

48:17.462 --> 48:19.862
and we'll just find other
 flowers to compliment them.

48:19.898 --> 48:20.763
Anna!

48:20.798 --> 48:21.898
- Yes.

48:21.933 --> 48:23.399
- You wanna help us
     pick some plants?

48:23.434 --> 48:24.433
- Sure.

48:24.469 --> 48:25.434
- Great.

48:25.470 --> 48:27.737
So, take a look around,
    see what else you want.

48:27.772 --> 48:29.772
- Just, okay.

48:29.807 --> 48:30.673
- Yeah.

48:31.609 --> 48:33.175
- His mom used to plant azaleas.

48:33.211 --> 48:34.810
The plant he got
      you is an azalea.

48:34.846 --> 48:36.712
- Shh, stop it and help me.

48:36.748 --> 48:38.981
- How about ornamental
     sweet potato?

48:41.552 --> 48:43.586
You have to admit
     that means something.

48:43.621 --> 48:45.788
- Yeah, it means I
  remind him of his mother.

48:45.823 --> 48:46.722
Not romantic.

48:48.593 --> 48:49.425
So, oh!

48:50.528 --> 48:53.963
Chace Devine, are you ready
 to get your hands dirty?

48:53.998 --> 48:55.298
- Lead the way.

48:55.333 --> 48:57.466
- Okay, so, the first
     rule of gardening

48:57.502 --> 49:00.202
is you can't garden
     while standing.

49:00.238 --> 49:00.970
There you go.

49:01.005 --> 49:02.038
- Okay, I get that.

49:07.946 --> 49:09.612
How's this?

49:09.647 --> 49:10.446
- It's great.

49:10.481 --> 49:11.514
- Yeah?

49:11.616 --> 49:13.182
- Yeah, I just didn't
 realize you were so delicate.

49:13.217 --> 49:14.417
- I'm not delicate.

49:14.452 --> 49:15.284
- You just kneeled
      down like you were

49:15.353 --> 49:17.320
about to be knighted
     by the queen mum.

49:17.355 --> 49:18.788
Okay, show me your hands.

49:20.291 --> 49:21.824
Okay.

49:21.859 --> 49:22.725
- Okay.

49:23.695 --> 49:25.962
- Great, now you're
     ready to garden.

49:27.565 --> 49:28.364
- I wanna just
     loosen it up right?

49:28.399 --> 49:29.966
- Loosen it up and
      then we're gonna

49:30.001 --> 49:31.667
get a shovel and we're
    gonna dig a proper hole.

49:31.703 --> 49:32.768
'Cause what we're gonna do--

49:32.804 --> 49:33.869
- Yeah.

49:33.905 --> 49:35.171
- Is we're gonna squeeze
    this a little bit

49:35.206 --> 49:36.806
and make sure it's
      not root bound.

49:38.443 --> 49:39.175
- A little guy.

49:39.210 --> 49:40.343
- It's a little guy.

49:40.378 --> 49:42.445
We just wanna loosen
     up the roots a little.

49:43.614 --> 49:45.748
So first we'll focus
     on the centerpiece.

49:45.783 --> 49:47.516
We'll get the azalea
     placement perfect,

49:47.552 --> 49:49.452
and then we'll build
     the rest of the garden

49:49.487 --> 49:50.720
around the azaleas.

49:53.624 --> 49:54.457
Yeah.

49:55.326 --> 49:57.026
How's that placement?

49:57.061 --> 49:57.960
- It's perfect.

49:59.464 --> 50:02.398
- So not all soil's
     the same right?

50:02.433 --> 50:03.432
- Oh, no.

50:03.468 --> 50:05.434
Soil is the most important
  part of the garden.

50:05.470 --> 50:07.303
There's six main types of soil.

50:07.338 --> 50:08.404
Feel it.

50:08.439 --> 50:09.705
It's kind of soft and
     soapy to the touch.

50:09.741 --> 50:11.207
- Ah, I see what you mean.

50:11.242 --> 50:11.907
Here, let me help you out.

50:11.943 --> 50:13.809
You clearly don't have enough.

50:13.845 --> 50:15.845
There, maybe some here.

50:15.880 --> 50:16.779
- Thank you.

50:17.615 --> 50:19.015
- Right there.

50:19.050 --> 50:20.282
Yeah, dirt suits you.

50:27.091 --> 50:29.792
Oh, okay.

50:29.827 --> 50:30.659
That's fine.

50:30.695 --> 50:31.794
That's fine.

50:31.829 --> 50:32.762
'Cause I didn't really work.

50:32.797 --> 50:33.562
I worked really hard on that.

50:35.166 --> 50:36.766
- Oh.

50:36.801 --> 50:37.533
- Go ahead.

50:37.568 --> 50:38.634
- No, that's.

50:38.669 --> 50:39.368
Do you need it?

50:39.404 --> 50:40.302
- No, go ahead.

50:40.338 --> 50:41.670
- I was just gonna clear it out.

50:41.706 --> 50:43.105
- Wow, look what we did.

50:43.941 --> 50:45.107
- I know.

50:45.143 --> 50:48.144
Not too shabby if
     I do say so myself.

50:48.179 --> 50:50.479
- I mean it's nice
     to see what we can do

50:50.515 --> 50:51.947
when we work together.

50:54.052 --> 50:55.017
- Yeah.

50:55.887 --> 50:56.719
It is.

50:59.824 --> 51:01.724
- Whoa, I gotta go.

51:01.759 --> 51:02.691
You're okay here right?

51:02.727 --> 51:03.793
- Yeah no, good.

51:03.828 --> 51:04.493
I gotta finish up anyway,

51:04.529 --> 51:05.494
make sure everything's pristine.

51:05.530 --> 51:06.462
Sort of how I roll.

51:07.765 --> 51:08.931
- Thanks for today.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.300
It brought me back to when I
 started working construction.

51:11.335 --> 51:14.036
It felt good to
     work with my hands.

51:14.072 --> 51:15.037
- Oh.

51:15.073 --> 51:15.905
Good.

51:17.909 --> 51:18.741
- Well,

51:19.844 --> 51:21.677
see ya around Victoria George.

51:33.324 --> 51:34.090
- Sorry.

51:34.125 --> 51:35.091
Vikki!

51:35.126 --> 51:36.125
Vikki I have to use the--

51:36.160 --> 51:37.726
- Oh my gosh Anna, are you okay?

51:37.762 --> 51:38.727
You're out of breath.

51:38.763 --> 51:40.629
- I know, I need
        to up my cardio.

51:40.665 --> 51:42.064
Ooh, do we have oxygen?

51:42.100 --> 51:43.432
Tell me we have oxygen.

51:43.468 --> 51:45.067
- Anna, what is it?

51:45.103 --> 51:47.203
- There's a gala, tonight.

51:47.238 --> 51:48.637
A Mayoral Gala.

51:48.673 --> 51:51.307
- Well that is very exciting,
 but we are not invited.

51:51.342 --> 51:52.942
- But what if we crashed it?

51:52.977 --> 51:53.876
- What?

51:53.911 --> 51:54.677
Why would we crash it?

51:54.745 --> 51:56.645
- Because the mayor
     will be there.

51:56.681 --> 51:58.080
Maybe you can talk to the mayor

51:58.116 --> 51:59.982
and convince her to
     declare the garden

52:00.017 --> 52:02.184
some sort of landmark
     or something.

52:02.220 --> 52:04.186
- So Chace Devine
    can't build his condos.

52:04.222 --> 52:05.588
- Exactly.

52:05.623 --> 52:07.423
- Wait, but why would she
  declare it a landmark?

52:07.458 --> 52:08.757
- Okay, not a landmark,

52:08.793 --> 52:09.892
but I don't know.

52:09.927 --> 52:12.294
It's been 20 years since
 your dad started the garden.

52:12.330 --> 52:14.997
It's been a part of the
  community for a long time.

52:15.032 --> 52:16.599
That has to mean something.

52:17.568 --> 52:18.567
- I don't know,
     crashing the event,

52:18.603 --> 52:20.069
that just seems crazy.

52:20.104 --> 52:20.936
- Vikki!

52:20.972 --> 52:23.105
We have two weeks
      before we have to

52:23.141 --> 52:24.607
be out of the garden.

52:24.642 --> 52:27.009
This might be the sort of
  hail Mary play we need.

52:27.044 --> 52:28.744
So put on your big girl pants

52:28.779 --> 52:30.179
and let's crash the gala.

52:40.224 --> 52:42.925
- I mean we live in a
  world with so much stuff.

52:42.960 --> 52:44.460
And I was so focused on things

52:44.495 --> 52:46.662
that I didn't
     really have a path.

52:46.697 --> 52:47.830
And now look at me.

52:47.865 --> 52:50.432
I'm a designer who
     focuses on minimalism.

52:51.335 --> 52:53.702
You know who the real enemy is?

52:53.738 --> 52:54.603
Tchotchke's.

52:56.841 --> 52:57.506
- Would you like to dance?

52:57.542 --> 52:59.408
- Oh, that would be wonderful.

53:03.147 --> 53:04.947
- So just give him
      the invitation.

53:04.982 --> 53:07.016
- You give him the invitation.

53:07.051 --> 53:08.350
- Don't tell me you
     forgot the invitation.

53:08.386 --> 53:09.752
- You were supposed to
     bring the invitation.

53:09.787 --> 53:11.120
- No, I distinctly
     remember telling you

53:11.155 --> 53:12.021
to bring the invitation.

53:12.123 --> 53:13.956
- And I told you to
     bring the invitation.

53:13.991 --> 53:16.091
- She forgot
     the invitation.

53:53.464 --> 53:55.130
- I can't believe
      we got in here.

53:55.166 --> 53:56.098
- I know.

53:56.133 --> 53:56.799
I told you, all we had
    to do was look the part

53:56.834 --> 53:58.767
and say we forgot the tickets.

53:58.803 --> 54:00.469
- Do you see the mayor anywhere?

54:03.407 --> 54:05.341
- Oh look, there she is.

54:06.344 --> 54:07.276
- Okay let's go.

54:11.782 --> 54:12.915
- Thank you
     for the donation.

54:12.950 --> 54:14.116
Enjoy your night.

54:14.151 --> 54:16.585
- Oh madam mayor, I'm
     so sorry to interrupt.

54:16.621 --> 54:18.354
- No don't worry, I'm
    happy to speak with you.

54:18.389 --> 54:19.788
- My name is Vikki George

54:19.824 --> 54:21.590
and I run the Community
 Garden in Saint Petersburg.

54:21.626 --> 54:22.925
- I read about it in the news.

54:22.960 --> 54:23.993
- Then you know a
     developer is planning

54:24.028 --> 54:26.829
on tearing it down to
  build condos on the land?

54:26.864 --> 54:28.097
- I read about that too.

54:28.132 --> 54:29.231
- Well the reason
      we approached you

54:29.300 --> 54:31.800
is we were hoping that your
 office could do something.

54:31.836 --> 54:34.136
Maybe declare the
      garden a landmark

54:34.171 --> 54:35.337
or a pillar of the community.

54:35.373 --> 54:38.007
Something, anything to stop
them from building on the land.

54:38.042 --> 54:39.141
We could really use your help.

54:39.176 --> 54:40.342
- I'm glad you came to me.

54:40.378 --> 54:42.144
I always want my
     constituents to feel

54:42.179 --> 54:43.145
like they can talk to me.

54:43.180 --> 54:45.047
- Wait, so you'll help us?

54:45.082 --> 54:46.782
- I don't know what
     I can do off hand,

54:46.817 --> 54:49.018
but I can have my staff
    do a little digging

54:49.053 --> 54:51.086
and maybe I can get back to you.

54:52.356 --> 54:54.923
- I'm sorry to ask, but
  how quickly would that be?

54:54.959 --> 54:56.158
It's just that
     we're under a little

54:56.193 --> 54:57.126
bit of a time crunch.

54:57.161 --> 54:58.894
We've got Garden Walk
    coming up in two weeks.

54:58.929 --> 55:00.062
- Tell you what,

55:00.097 --> 55:01.930
I will have an answer
    for you at Garden Walk.

55:02.867 --> 55:04.967
- Thank you much madam Mayor.

55:05.002 --> 55:06.235
- I can't make any promises.

55:06.270 --> 55:07.469
- No, of course not.

55:07.505 --> 55:09.038
But just looking into
     it is promise enough.

55:09.073 --> 55:10.506
- It's the promise of hope.

55:10.541 --> 55:11.373
- Yeah.

55:11.409 --> 55:13.242
Of course, it'll be my pleasure.

55:13.277 --> 55:15.077
Now if you'll excuse me.

55:15.112 --> 55:15.944
- Sure.

55:19.016 --> 55:19.715
It worked.

55:19.750 --> 55:20.916
- I know, it worked!

55:20.951 --> 55:21.850
- Well fingers
      crossed it worked.

55:21.886 --> 55:22.951
- Yes, fingers crossed...

55:26.190 --> 55:27.289
Vikki.

55:29.226 --> 55:31.360
- Did you know he
      was gonna be here?

55:31.395 --> 55:33.228
- I'm gonna go get
      us some drinks.

55:39.003 --> 55:40.269
- Vikki.

55:40.304 --> 55:41.136
- Chace.

55:42.206 --> 55:43.238
- Wow.

55:43.274 --> 55:44.973
- Oh, stop.

55:45.009 --> 55:47.543
I feel kind of silly
     dressed like this.

55:47.578 --> 55:49.311
- Really, you look beautiful.

55:51.048 --> 55:51.914
- Thank you.

55:53.317 --> 55:55.617
- So, wanna dance?

55:57.254 --> 55:58.921
What about Marta?

55:58.956 --> 56:00.622
- Oh, Marta and I broke up.

56:01.892 --> 56:04.460
Yeah, we decided it was time
 to focus on other things.

56:05.730 --> 56:09.965
She wanted to minimize
  everything, including me.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.200
- Oh no!

56:11.235 --> 56:12.968
Sorry.

56:13.003 --> 56:13.902
- I'm not.

56:15.239 --> 56:17.306
Really, it's for the best.

56:17.341 --> 56:18.307
For both of us.

56:20.177 --> 56:23.145
So, about that dance?

56:26.083 --> 56:27.216
- I would love to,
      but the truth is

56:27.251 --> 56:29.284
I'm not really sure I know how.

56:29.320 --> 56:31.453
- Come on, it's a piece of cake.

56:32.823 --> 56:33.655
I'll lead.

56:36.293 --> 56:37.359
There we go.

56:42.433 --> 56:44.233
Okay, so this goes here.

56:44.268 --> 56:45.134
- Okay.

56:46.704 --> 56:48.337
- Now you just hold onto me.

57:36.887 --> 57:37.753
Thank you.

57:38.789 --> 57:41.356
- Hey Chace, can
      I ask you a favor?

57:41.392 --> 57:42.491
- Of course.

57:43.494 --> 57:45.294
- Before you make your final
 decision on the garden,

57:45.329 --> 57:46.728
would you come to Garden Walk?

57:46.764 --> 57:48.163
I just think it
     would be a great way

57:48.199 --> 57:51.066
for you to see the
 community spirit in action.

57:51.101 --> 57:53.368
- Tonight I couldn't
     refuse you anything.

57:53.404 --> 57:55.404
- It was really my pleasure.

57:55.439 --> 57:56.505
- I'm glad.

57:58.209 --> 57:59.174
- So you'll come?

58:00.411 --> 58:02.010
- You don't stop do you?

58:03.714 --> 58:06.315
Where do you get
     that determination?

58:06.350 --> 58:07.216
- My dad.

58:07.985 --> 58:09.151
He'd always say "Look up,

58:09.186 --> 58:10.886
"there's a way
     over any obstacle."

58:10.921 --> 58:14.456
So I guess I'm just
     always looking up.

58:14.492 --> 58:15.390
- I like that.

58:16.327 --> 58:17.726
Sounds like he was a wise man.

58:17.761 --> 58:18.594
- He was.

58:18.629 --> 58:19.528
- Look up.

58:26.537 --> 58:28.437
I guess I'm the obstacle huh?

58:30.274 --> 58:31.473
- Look up Chace.

58:39.483 --> 58:41.650
- I should let you get
     back to your friend.

58:42.953 --> 58:45.187
But I'll come to
        the Garden Walk.

58:45.222 --> 58:46.021
- Yeah?

58:46.056 --> 58:46.922
- Yeah.

59:01.472 --> 59:03.071
- Okay you guys,
        I need everybody

59:03.107 --> 59:04.540
to be on their A game.

59:04.575 --> 59:06.975
Everything has to be perfect
 for Garden Walk this year.

59:07.011 --> 59:07.910
No cutting corners.

59:07.945 --> 59:09.244
Everything's gotta be spot on,

59:09.280 --> 59:11.346
and remember, they're
     judging on fullness,

59:11.382 --> 59:13.048
organization, and varieties.

59:13.083 --> 59:15.450
Okay you guys,
      let's get to work.

59:17.321 --> 59:18.053
- Vikki!

59:18.088 --> 59:18.787
- Yeah!

59:18.822 --> 59:19.855
- I have a complaint.

59:19.890 --> 59:20.822
- Is it about Mr. Boyle?

59:20.858 --> 59:22.691
- Well of course it's Mr. Boyle.

59:22.726 --> 59:23.792
- How did I know?

59:23.861 --> 59:25.494
- He's helping everyone
 with their streamers but me.

59:25.529 --> 59:27.329
- Okay, but maybe if you
    just asked him nicely.

59:27.364 --> 59:28.030
- Ask?

59:28.065 --> 59:30.032
You think I'd actually ask him?

59:30.067 --> 59:31.266
Have you heard the rumors?

59:31.302 --> 59:33.101
He's been trying to move plots

59:33.137 --> 59:35.203
to get away from my tomatoes.

59:35.239 --> 59:36.805
There's no way I'd
      ask him for help

59:36.840 --> 59:38.140
with an attitude like that.

59:38.175 --> 59:39.708
- Okay, but you do need help.

59:39.743 --> 59:40.642
- Yes.

59:40.678 --> 59:41.510
- From Mr. Boyle.

59:41.545 --> 59:42.344
- Yes.

59:42.379 --> 59:43.979
- So what's the solution?

59:44.014 --> 59:45.147
- You ask him.

59:45.182 --> 59:46.915
- You want me to
        ask him for you?

59:46.951 --> 59:48.050
- Exactly.

59:48.085 --> 59:49.418
- Ms. Hewitt.

59:49.453 --> 59:50.452
Okay fine.

59:50.487 --> 59:51.687
I'll do it, okay.

59:51.722 --> 59:53.155
But we really all
      have to get along.

59:53.190 --> 59:55.591
We have to put our
      differences aside.

59:55.626 --> 59:58.694
- I'll put mine aside,
    once he puts his aside.

59:58.729 --> 01:00:00.028
Is that fair?

01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:02.397
- I guess it'll have to be.

01:00:02.433 --> 01:00:03.332
Okay, I'll talk to him.

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:04.166
- Thank you.

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:05.434
- Oh you're welcome.

01:00:05.469 --> 01:00:06.401
- Vikki, I wanted to
     show you the dresses

01:00:06.437 --> 01:00:07.669
I ordered for the event.

01:00:07.705 --> 01:00:08.637
- Okay, do we have
     to do this right now?

01:00:08.706 --> 01:00:09.271
- I pinned six dresses
     and ordered them all.

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.639
Which one's your favorite?

01:00:10.674 --> 01:00:11.540
- You know what, this one.

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:12.407
It's perfect.

01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:13.108
You're gonna look beautiful!

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:14.443
- That one's my favorite too.

01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:15.377
- Great.
      - Thank you Vikki.

01:00:15.412 --> 01:00:16.511
- Oh my god.

01:00:16.547 --> 01:00:17.746
- Yeah, any word from the Mayor?

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:18.780
- No, and she was
     supposed to give us

01:00:18.816 --> 01:00:19.948
an answer by Garden Walk.

01:00:19.984 --> 01:00:21.049
- So she's cutting it close.

01:00:21.085 --> 01:00:22.017
- Yeah, I know.

01:00:24.555 --> 01:00:25.988
Aren't we all.

01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:33.695
- Ladies and gentlemen!

01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:35.597
Ladies and gentlemen,
     welcome to the

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:39.001
46th annual Saint
    Petersburg Garden Walk!

01:00:40.871 --> 01:00:42.371
Have a wonderful day!

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.873
- Hello, welcome to the garden.

01:00:44.908 --> 01:00:46.842
Thank you for coming.

01:00:46.877 --> 01:00:47.909
Thanks for coming.

01:00:49.113 --> 01:00:50.679
Thank you for coming
     to the garden.

01:00:50.714 --> 01:00:52.314
Hope you guys enjoy
     your time here.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:53.749
Thank you so much.

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:56.718
Hey, thank you for
     coming to the garden.

01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:04.760
You came.

01:01:04.795 --> 01:01:05.894
- You're surprised?

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.096
- I mean a little.

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:10.899
- Well I wanted to
      check on our plot.

01:01:10.934 --> 01:01:12.534
Make sure you're
      taking care of it.

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:14.536
- You wanna come
      see for yourself?

01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:15.303
- After you.

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:16.238
- Thank you.

01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:27.549
- This
      place looks great.

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:29.551
- Mm hm, it's pretty cool what
 a couple of weeks will do.

01:01:29.586 --> 01:01:30.585
What do you think?

01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:32.721
- Wait a minute.

01:01:33.624 --> 01:01:35.724
This is the, this is the one?

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.893
I helped do this?

01:01:37.928 --> 01:01:39.795
- No, you did do this.

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:40.929
I helped you.

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:43.565
I always say that
      a garden is like

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.733
a little slice of home.

01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:47.102
It's also a reflection of
 the gardener who planted it.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:48.737
And this garden,

01:01:48.772 --> 01:01:51.039
especially because of your mom.

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:52.474
It's a reflection of you.

01:01:53.777 --> 01:01:54.843
- I don't know what to say.

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:55.977
- You don't have
        to say anything,

01:01:56.013 --> 01:01:57.979
you can just kinda take it in.

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:00.182
- Hey.

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:01.083
- Hey.

01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:03.885
Hi.

01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:06.688
So, I guess there's some people

01:02:06.724 --> 01:02:07.389
I'd like you to meet.

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:09.024
Everyone this is Chace Devine.

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.325
This is Alex.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.560
- Hi.
     - And you know Anna.

01:02:11.595 --> 01:02:13.762
- And Serena,
     you guys met before.

01:02:13.797 --> 01:02:14.830
- Nice to
     see you again Chace.

01:02:14.865 --> 01:02:16.765
- Hello.
     - And this is my mom.

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:22.204
- I actually helped
Chace plant this azalea garden.

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.505
- Well I love this garden.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:24.206
- Yeah.

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:24.906
- This is the exact spot

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:26.308
we danced on our wedding day.

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:27.442
- Yes it is.

01:02:37.054 --> 01:02:37.919
- So they got married here?

01:02:37.955 --> 01:02:38.920
- Yup.

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:40.021
- I had no idea.

01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:41.490
- We all decorated the
 garden, did it all in white.

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:43.058
It was really a
      beautiful wedding.

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:44.960
You see, our garden's
     part of the community.

01:02:44.995 --> 01:02:45.894
People love it as much as I do.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:47.829
They wanna make it a
     part of their lives,

01:02:47.865 --> 01:02:48.830
we're like a family.

01:02:48.866 --> 01:02:51.867
- Don't you think this
     is a wonderful event?

01:02:51.902 --> 01:02:52.701
- I do.

01:02:53.704 --> 01:02:55.737
But you know what would
    make it even better?

01:02:56.507 --> 01:02:58.140
A little dancing.

01:02:58.175 --> 01:03:00.175
- Oh I don't know.

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:02.811
- I have just the
      partner in mind.

01:03:02.846 --> 01:03:04.179
- Mr. Boyle?

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:05.847
- You want me to dance with her?

01:03:05.883 --> 01:03:06.782
- Why not?

01:03:06.817 --> 01:03:08.150
- I haven't danced in years!

01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:08.884
- Come on!

01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:10.552
It's like riding a bike.

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:18.160
- Who would've
     though the two of us

01:03:18.195 --> 01:03:19.895
would be dancing together?

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:23.231
- They say Garden Walk
     is a magical time.

01:03:24.334 --> 01:03:27.702
- I never told you how much
 I admire your tomatoes.

01:03:27.738 --> 01:03:29.437
- Thank you Mr. Boyle.

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:30.972
- Oh don't mention it.

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:32.374
- And I have to say,

01:03:32.409 --> 01:03:34.943
your peppers are coming
  in beautifully this year.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.278
- Ah they are aren't they?

01:03:38.715 --> 01:03:40.048
Aren't we a pair?

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:42.350
- A pair of old shoes.

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:44.786
- But at least
     they're dancing shoes.

01:03:44.822 --> 01:03:45.754
- Oh.

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:47.122
- Let's do a little spin.

01:03:54.264 --> 01:03:57.065
- Ladies and gentlemen,
    please gather around!

01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:02.037
I am here to announce the winner

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:04.172
of this years Garden Walk!

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:05.707
Congratulations to

01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:08.610
The Community Garden!

01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:21.022
After touring 17
     gardens, hands down,

01:04:21.058 --> 01:04:23.258
you have embraced
      the beauty, charm,

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:24.860
and polish we look for.

01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:27.162
As well as that
      community spirit,

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.030
we cannot deny.

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:35.570
- Thank you.

01:04:35.606 --> 01:04:36.471
- Speech.

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:37.806
Speech.

01:04:37.841 --> 01:04:39.441
- You know, the thing
 about this Community Garden

01:04:39.476 --> 01:04:42.244
is it really does belong
    to the entire community.

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:44.913
So this isn't just a
     win for us gardeners,

01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:47.649
this is a win for the
     whole neighborhood.

01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:49.851
So congratulations to us all!

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:54.990
Oh, would you like this?

01:04:57.094 --> 01:04:58.727
- Congratulations.

01:04:58.762 --> 01:04:59.895
- Yeah, it is pretty great.

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:02.731
Hey, do you wanna see something
else that's pretty great?

01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:03.632
- Sure.

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:09.137
- Shh.

01:05:11.108 --> 01:05:14.042
The butterfly bushes bloomed.

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.477
- Why are we whispering?

01:05:16.747 --> 01:05:18.747
- Because I thought it was
  more charming like that.

01:05:18.782 --> 01:05:20.548
Okay, just smell it.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:21.583
Come on.

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:22.484
- Alright.

01:05:25.155 --> 01:05:26.655
- Mm, it's heaven.

01:05:28.926 --> 01:05:29.658
- Wow.

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:30.525
- I know right?

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.726
When I was a little girl

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:33.762
I used to pluck the
     petals off this plant

01:05:33.797 --> 01:05:35.163
and rub them between my fingers,

01:05:35.198 --> 01:05:36.064
put 'em on my wrist

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.198
and pretend like I
     was wearing perfume.

01:05:37.234 --> 01:05:39.301
I felt so grown up.

01:05:42.172 --> 01:05:43.038
You wanna try?

01:05:43.974 --> 01:05:46.207
- I don't really wanna
     smell like a flower.

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:47.242
- Oh come on.

01:05:50.747 --> 01:05:52.714
- How 'bout I put it on you?

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:55.216
- Okay.

01:05:56.386 --> 01:05:59.154
- So I just pluck
      it off like that?

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:31.052
- Vikki!

01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:34.356
Vikki where are you?

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:39.561
Vikki!

01:06:39.596 --> 01:06:41.329
- I think you're needed.

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:42.230
- Yeah.

01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:46.234
- Come on, I'll help you up.

01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:47.969
- Vikki!

01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:49.504
- It sounds so important.

01:06:49.539 --> 01:06:50.405
- Yeah.

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:55.276
- Will you excuse me?

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:56.144
- Sure.

01:06:59.316 --> 01:07:00.281
- Vikki come on!

01:07:00.317 --> 01:07:01.249
- What is it?

01:07:01.284 --> 01:07:02.250
- The Mayor is here.

01:07:02.285 --> 01:07:03.118
- The Mayor?

01:07:03.153 --> 01:07:04.085
- Yes, she's been waiting.

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:04.986
Mayor Price.

01:07:06.056 --> 01:07:09.257
- Vikki, congratulations
    on your big win today.

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:10.291
- Madam Mayor, thank you so much

01:07:10.327 --> 01:07:11.826
for coming down to the garden.

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:15.330
- Well, I wish it could be
 under better circumstances.

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:17.465
- What do you mean?

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:19.167
- My office looked
      into your case

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:21.836
and unfortunately
  there's nothing we can do

01:07:21.872 --> 01:07:23.872
to help you save the garden.

01:07:23.907 --> 01:07:26.474
It looks like that
     decision will entirely

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:28.176
be left to Chace Devine.

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:30.912
- Well.

01:07:31.848 --> 01:07:33.715
Thank you so much for
     trying Mayor Price.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.216
- I'm just sorry
      I couldn't come to

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:36.284
you with good news.

01:07:36.319 --> 01:07:37.318
- Oh I understand.

01:07:46.163 --> 01:07:49.597
Chace, if there is any
     way you can think of

01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:51.132
to save our garden...

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:55.503
- I wish I could.

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:59.107
- Just please try
      to think of a way.

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:03.478
Just try.

01:08:05.816 --> 01:08:08.817
- Ink
      Chace, just think.

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:16.991
- Knock knock.

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.564
Thought you could
     use a cup of coffee.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:23.497
- Bless you.

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:24.832
- Don't mention it.

01:08:26.103 --> 01:08:27.502
Are you alright?

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.207
- I'm stuck Ilya.

01:08:33.877 --> 01:08:35.577
How do I tell her that
     there's no solution?

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:39.180
That I'm gonna have to
     shut down the garden.

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:40.682
- You're a smart man Chace.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:44.719
If you want it bad enough,
  you'll think of something.

01:08:48.758 --> 01:08:49.756
- I hope you're right.

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:54.929
- It's so peaceful
      here at night.

01:08:54.965 --> 01:08:56.764
- It's peaceful
      here all the time.

01:08:58.135 --> 01:09:00.167
I can't believe tomorrow
    this will all be gone.

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:03.238
- Honey, you can't
      think like that.

01:09:03.273 --> 01:09:05.140
- But it's over mom.

01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:06.040
I failed.

01:09:07.077 --> 01:09:08.542
Tomorrow Chace shuts
     this property down,

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:10.044
soon construction will begin

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.546
and dads dream will be
     but a distant memory.

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:15.283
- But we'll always have
    the memory sweetie,

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:16.451
if not the garden.

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:20.787
- I know.

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:23.024
It's just this place
     has become more

01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:24.893
than just memories for me.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.228
It was a way to bring
     people together,

01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:29.397
but it was also just
    this feeling, you know.

01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:30.865
For the whole neighborhood.

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:33.768
It's home.

01:09:35.805 --> 01:09:37.939
Dad always said, "Look up,

01:09:37.974 --> 01:09:40.207
"there's a way over
     every obstacle."

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:42.510
I just wish I was able to find

01:09:42.546 --> 01:09:43.611
my way over this one mom.

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:45.813
I wish I could have
     figured it out.

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:16.811
- Look up.

01:10:23.587 --> 01:10:25.920
There's a way over
      every obstacle.

01:10:25.956 --> 01:10:26.821
Look up.

01:11:08.999 --> 01:11:10.331
- Come on Chace.

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:12.634
Don't let me down.

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:39.387
- Hey Ilya, can you run
    this by engineering?

01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:42.290
- Hi Chace.

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:45.093
Surprised to see me?

01:12:46.996 --> 01:12:48.463
- I have to say I am.

01:12:50.266 --> 01:12:51.866
What can I do for you?

01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:53.901
- I came here to thank you.

01:12:53.937 --> 01:12:54.869
- For what?

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:57.305
- I've been hired by a
     New York design firm.

01:12:58.508 --> 01:12:59.841
- What?

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:01.175
- And I wanted you to be
 the first to hear the news.

01:13:01.211 --> 01:13:02.844
You were the one
      who believed in me

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:03.845
and gave me my big break.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.713
So if it weren't for you...

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:07.148
- Congratulations.

01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:07.949
- Thank you.

01:13:07.984 --> 01:13:09.050
- That's great news.

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:09.951
- I know.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.987
I saw you dancing at the gala.

01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:14.355
Was that Vikki George?

01:13:15.358 --> 01:13:16.257
- Yes.

01:13:16.292 --> 01:13:17.425
- You seem quite taken with her.

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:20.895
- Well she's really opened
 my eyes to what's important.

01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:25.366
It's not just the buildings,
 it's the people inside them.

01:13:25.402 --> 01:13:28.236
Everyone around them,
     the entire community.

01:13:28.271 --> 01:13:29.971
- I'm happy for you.

01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:31.873
You looked perfect together.

01:13:32.876 --> 01:13:34.609
- I don't know if
     she feels the same.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:39.347
I did something that she
  may never forgive me for.

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:42.450
- You're a good man Chace,

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:45.019
and if she's as great
     as you think she is,

01:13:45.054 --> 01:13:46.187
she'll see that.

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:51.993
- I don't know.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:18.953
- Well as you all know,

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:21.389
Chace shut down the
     community Garden.

01:14:21.424 --> 01:14:23.825
But I just wanna ask
     you to sit tight.

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:27.061
I am determined to come up
 with some sort of solution.

01:14:28.498 --> 01:14:30.565
The garden started
     off as my dad's dream,

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.700
but it's really become mine.

01:14:33.736 --> 01:14:34.869
And I promise, I'm
      gonna find a way

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:36.337
for us to start over.

01:14:37.707 --> 01:14:38.873
- I'm so sorry Vikki.

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:40.708
We'll get the garden back.

01:14:40.743 --> 01:14:42.109
- I know.

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:43.845
It just takes a little faith.

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:47.882
- Call you later?

01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:48.749
- Yeah.

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:50.718
Love you mom.

01:14:50.753 --> 01:14:51.886
- Love you too honey.

01:14:52.722 --> 01:14:53.521
- Vikki.

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:56.891
- Mr. Boyle, Ms. Hewitt,
    it is the hardest

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:58.392
to share this news
     with the two of you.

01:14:58.428 --> 01:15:00.495
I know how much the
  garden meant to you both,

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:01.829
but I promise, I really am--

01:15:01.865 --> 01:15:05.333
- Hey hey, Vikki
      we have some news.

01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:08.636
- We're, well I
     guess we're dating.

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:10.538
- Wait, what?

01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:11.906
- We're dating.

01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:13.908
Isn't it fantastic!

01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:15.877
- Yeah!

01:15:15.912 --> 01:15:18.813
Of course, but, how
     did this happen?

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:20.581
- It was the day
     of the Garden Walk.

01:15:20.617 --> 01:15:23.117
Maybe it was the
     music and the dancing.

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:25.152
- But we realized all
     our constant bickering

01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:27.522
may have been a result of some

01:15:27.557 --> 01:15:29.857
unresolved feelings between us.

01:15:29.893 --> 01:15:31.592
- Well this is amazing.

01:15:31.628 --> 01:15:34.395
- She's about tomatoes
  and I'm all about peppers.

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:37.565
- Oh, I am so
     happy for you both.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.000
- Thank you Vikki.

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:42.203
- But those weren't the
 only sparks we saw that day.

01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:44.372
- Yeah, we admit
     that you were burning

01:15:44.407 --> 01:15:45.606
pretty bright yourself as well.

01:15:45.642 --> 01:15:48.643
- We were hoping maybe you had
 some good news of your own.

01:15:48.678 --> 01:15:52.113
- Oh no, that's something
  that can never happen now.

01:15:52.148 --> 01:15:52.947
- Sure.

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:55.383
Sometimes all it takes is to put

01:15:55.418 --> 01:15:57.318
your differences aside.

01:15:57.987 --> 01:15:59.587
- Not with the garden.

01:15:59.622 --> 01:16:01.589
There's been too much
     that's come between us

01:16:01.624 --> 01:16:02.957
for us to ever be together.

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:04.225
Especially now.

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:08.296
But I am so happy
     for the two of you.

01:16:08.331 --> 01:16:09.463
I really am.

01:16:11.668 --> 01:16:12.833
Oh it's wonderful.

01:16:22.345 --> 01:16:23.811
I tried so hard.

01:16:29.052 --> 01:16:30.751
- Vikki, Vikki!

01:16:30.787 --> 01:16:31.686
Just let me talk to you.
    - Chace.

01:16:31.788 --> 01:16:33.120
- Let me talk to you.
     - No, no, no, no, no.

01:16:33.156 --> 01:16:34.388
- I don't
      wanna talk to you.

01:16:34.424 --> 01:16:35.723
- I know you're
     still angry with me.

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:36.591
- No, I know what
      you're gonna say.

01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:38.159
You're gonna say
     there was no solution

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:38.859
and I get it.

01:16:38.895 --> 01:16:40.761
But I had just hoped beyond hope

01:16:40.797 --> 01:16:42.263
that you would think
     with your heart

01:16:42.298 --> 01:16:43.397
instead of your head

01:16:43.433 --> 01:16:45.066
and help me find a
     way to save my garden.

01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:46.634
- I couldn't save the site.

01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:48.936
There was too much
      money invested,

01:16:48.972 --> 01:16:49.804
too many jobs at stake.

01:16:49.839 --> 01:16:51.205
- No I understand.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.673
I really do.

01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:54.976
I'm just not ready to
     forgive you for it.

01:16:55.011 --> 01:16:57.979
Because for me,
     this was everything.

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:00.881
This was my dream.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:04.018
And you crushed it
     Chace, you crushed it.

01:17:05.588 --> 01:17:06.854
Chace, look at it.

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:08.990
There's nothing left.

01:17:09.025 --> 01:17:10.458
- I know, I know, but Vikki--

01:17:10.493 --> 01:17:11.792
- No butts Chace.

01:17:11.828 --> 01:17:12.860
- Vikki, just let me--

01:17:12.895 --> 01:17:13.928
- I saw you.

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:14.829
- What?

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.399
- I saw you with Marta.

01:17:19.369 --> 01:17:20.201
- When?

01:17:21.671 --> 01:17:23.804
- You were at your office
  and you were hugging her

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.640
and I saw you Chace.

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:28.576
- Vikki that was nothing.

01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:31.646
She got a job in New York,
  I was congratulating her.

01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:34.915
- Why should I believe
     anything you say?

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:38.185
- Because I've always
     been honest with you.

01:17:42.392 --> 01:17:44.091
- It doesn't matter.

01:17:44.727 --> 01:17:46.394
It doesn't change anything.

01:17:46.429 --> 01:17:47.261
- Vikki.

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.199
Take one more walk with me?

01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:57.071
Please, trust me.

01:17:58.408 --> 01:18:00.007
I promise I won't let you down.

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:10.851
Almost there.

01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:12.920
- We're in your office building.

01:18:12.955 --> 01:18:14.188
- Just a little further.

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:33.007
I just want you to know

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:36.143
I made some changes
     to my business model.

01:18:36.179 --> 01:18:37.611
Changes inspired by you.

01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:42.049
I took a hard look
     at what's important.

01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:46.187
It's not just about
 succeeding to honor my mom,

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:49.290
it's to honor her
      spirit as well.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.127
I wanted to put a piece of
 her in all of my buildings.

01:18:53.963 --> 01:18:55.062
A piece of my home.

01:18:56.566 --> 01:18:58.532
And Vikki, you're
      the one who made

01:18:58.568 --> 01:19:00.501
me realize what
      home means to me.

01:19:02.105 --> 01:19:04.305
So, I took your dad's advice.

01:19:05.842 --> 01:19:09.777
When faced with an
     obstacle, I looked up.

01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:23.023
This is for you.

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:47.381
- You moved the garden.

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:48.282
- I did.

01:19:52.555 --> 01:19:53.687
- It's all here.

01:19:55.825 --> 01:19:59.193
- I told you I would come up
 with a compromise if I could.

01:19:59.228 --> 01:20:02.096
But I think I came up with
  something even better.

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:04.131
A rooftop community garden.

01:20:04.934 --> 01:20:07.001
And this won't be the only one.

01:20:07.036 --> 01:20:08.702
I'm converting every rooftop

01:20:08.738 --> 01:20:11.338
in every one of my buildings
 into garden spaces.

01:20:11.374 --> 01:20:15.142
And Vikki, I'm gonna need
  someone to run them all

01:20:15.178 --> 01:20:17.845
and I hope that
     someone will be you.

01:20:19.882 --> 01:20:22.316
- You moved every single plot,

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:24.685
every single plant.

01:20:26.722 --> 01:20:28.088
You saved the garden.

01:20:33.029 --> 01:20:34.428
- Is that a yes?

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:37.231
- Chace,

01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:40.167
you saved my dream.

01:20:42.905 --> 01:20:59.053
And you've given me a new one.
