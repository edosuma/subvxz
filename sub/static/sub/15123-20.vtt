WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:05.039
Sabrina, get over here and
help me drink these margaritas

00:05.106 --> 00:06.440
or it'll be your fault

00:06.507 --> 00:08.742
if I drunk-dial
my A.A. sponsor again.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.644
SABRINA:
I'll be right there.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.346
Hello!

00:12.413 --> 00:14.182
Jimmy, what are you
doing here?

00:14.248 --> 00:15.849
It's girls' night in.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.852
This is me and Sabrina time,
not you and Sabrina time.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.154
I know. I'm
just wondering

00:20.221 --> 00:21.822
if you have any freezer
space available.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.191
Power's out at the gas station.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.059
So they're giving away
all the ice before it melts.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.860
Which is stupid because
they could just wait

00:26.927 --> 00:28.762
and sell it as water.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.030
Did you guys
redecorate?

00:30.098 --> 00:33.067
Yeah, I got stuck on a plane
for seven hours last month.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.469
Went a little crazy
with the Sky Store catalog.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.571
Whoa!

00:37.638 --> 00:39.307
Pizza clock!

00:39.373 --> 00:41.775
I hate clocks, but I love pizza!

00:41.842 --> 00:42.743
That thing's blowing my mind.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.112
After we drink those margarita--

00:44.178 --> 00:45.413
Oh! Hey, Jimmy.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.317
Virginia.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.252
I didn't know
you guys got 3-D TV.

00:51.319 --> 00:53.621
No, I didn't.

00:53.687 --> 00:54.655
Those are my glasses.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.257
Wait, you wear glasses?

00:56.324 --> 00:58.392
Wait, is this the first time
you've seen me clearly?

00:58.459 --> 00:59.727
I just usually wear contacts.

00:59.793 --> 01:00.728
They're huge.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.531
They're like orthopedic shoes
for your face.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.799
Yeah, well, they're just the
only frames that are big enough

01:05.866 --> 01:07.401
to support the weight
of lenses that thick.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.436
They're actually
my grandpa's.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.970
They saved his
life in the war.

01:10.037 --> 01:11.439
Apparently, the Japanese
thought he was

01:11.505 --> 01:12.906
too ridiculous-looking
to be a threat.

01:12.973 --> 01:15.109
Why are you afraid for me
to see your glasses?

01:15.176 --> 01:16.810
I mean, you wear them
in front of Shelley.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.780
Well, I don't want Shelley
to be attracted to me.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.816
Then you shouldn't be wearing
such sexy pajamas, slut.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.787
Those margaritas
are very strong.

01:26.854 --> 01:27.988
It's not really a big deal.

01:28.055 --> 01:30.090
I mean, I can
see fine without them.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.959
Oh, my little Hopey!

01:32.025 --> 01:33.026
Cold!

01:33.093 --> 01:34.862
(screams):
Oh, Hope!

01:36.664 --> 01:37.898
* Whoo! *

01:37.965 --> 01:39.333
* Here we go *

01:39.400 --> 01:42.736
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! *

01:42.803 --> 01:44.738
(bee buzzing)

01:47.308 --> 01:48.742
Sabrina, you got to
come out here

01:48.809 --> 01:50.978
and look at this bee
that chased me.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.780
I swear it's the same bee

01:52.846 --> 01:55.183
that chased me yesterday
and the day before that.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.317
Okay, I'll be right out.

01:56.384 --> 01:57.585
We're just finishing up
our study group.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.853
I know you said
all bees look alike,

01:59.920 --> 02:02.590
but I recognize this guy
'cause of his huge stinger.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.692
(chuckles) At least,
I think it's his stinger.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.560
Jimmy, this is Philip.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.829
Philip, this is
my boyfriend, Jimmy.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.198
Hey, Jimmy the boyfriend.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.166
Thanks for letting me
borrow Sabrina.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.801
We got some good cramming
in there.

02:13.867 --> 02:14.835
Excuse me?

02:14.902 --> 02:16.570
Uh, so, yeah, I'll see you
at class tomorrow.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.639
I'll be the one sleeping.
(chuckles)

02:18.706 --> 02:21.409
(chuckles): She'll be sleeping
in class 'cause she's bored.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.045
I get jokes.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.881
I noticed, uh, you guys
were studying in your bedroom.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.383
Uh-huh.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.118
Lot of seats out here
in the living room.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.753
In the bedroom, just one bed.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.588
Yeah, it's just more practical
for us in there,

02:34.655 --> 02:36.890
because on our study breaks,
we like to have hot, sweaty sex.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.158
That's funny.

02:38.226 --> 02:39.660
Uh, I just thought
you had a study group

02:39.727 --> 02:42.663
and not a study "handsome-guy-
with-a-fancy-messenger-bag."

02:42.730 --> 02:43.964
(sighs):
Oh, God.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.500
You're not going to be all weird
about this stuff like Wyatt was.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.336
Or show me your Q-tips
after you swab your ears.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.703
That's another thing
he was weird about.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.138
That's actually me.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.706
I do the Q-tip thing.

02:52.773 --> 02:53.907
Yeah, I know.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.810
I just thought that'd be
a good way to tell you to stop.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.616
Maybe I'm being crazy.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.352
Maybe Sabrina and him
are just friends.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.554
No way. Men and women
cannot be just friends.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.821
Ashton Kutcher proved that

03:07.888 --> 03:09.857
in, like, five different movies
last year.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.259
This guy's trying to steal
your girl, Jimmy.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.926
We already helped you

03:12.993 --> 03:14.862
steal her from one guy who was
way more attractive than you.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.730
We're never gonna be able
to do that again.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.699
Well, how do you know
he's more attractive than me?

03:18.766 --> 03:20.534
You haven't seen him.
I'm guessing if he was
short and fat,

03:20.601 --> 03:22.436
we wouldn't be
having this conversation.
All right,

03:22.503 --> 03:24.171
I'm gonna go and talk
to Philip and tell him

03:24.238 --> 03:25.306
if he doesn't
stay away from Sabrina,

03:25.373 --> 03:26.474
I'll help him get his B.A.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.776
And by that,
I mean "busted ass."

03:28.842 --> 03:30.110
BURT:
Ah.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.111
That's pretty good.

03:31.178 --> 03:32.212
JIMMY:
Thanks. I've been

03:32.280 --> 03:33.681
working on it
since this morning.

03:33.747 --> 03:34.948
If he was going for his B.S.,
I'd say "busted stomach."

03:35.015 --> 03:36.650
Uh, you got lucked out
with the B.A., Jimmy

03:36.717 --> 03:37.785
Let's just leave
it at that.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.487
It's risky.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.621
If Sabrina finds out
you went over there,

03:40.688 --> 03:41.589
she's gonna think you're crazy.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.591
We need to
come up with a plan

03:43.657 --> 03:45.926
that'll get us hard evidence
to prove it to her.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.695
Or we could
just give up.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.630
I mean, haven't we put
enough time

03:49.697 --> 03:51.332
into this stupid relationship?

03:53.701 --> 03:56.670
I'm just getting
a little tired of it.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.409
I'm sure it's a great plan; I
just don't get how it works.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.176
That's why I set up
this demonstration.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.745
Oh, hey,
what you doing, Jimmy?

04:04.812 --> 04:06.547
You were in there
kind of a long time.

04:06.614 --> 04:09.617
Yep, just, uh, getting ready
to head over to Sabrina's.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.620
Cool. I hope you didn't use
my razor to shave your privates.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.821
What?

04:13.887 --> 04:16.557
I didn't shave anything.

04:16.624 --> 04:19.126
What, uh, what makes you
think that?

04:19.192 --> 04:21.295
Because Sabrina texted you
and said, "Come over,

04:21.362 --> 04:23.331
and I want you smooth
as a baby seal."

04:23.397 --> 04:24.865
How did you know

04:24.932 --> 04:26.266
what Sabrina texted me?

04:26.334 --> 04:27.768
Because Sabrina didn't text you.

04:27.835 --> 04:28.969
I did!

04:29.036 --> 04:30.738
I went into your phone

04:30.804 --> 04:33.441
and put my number
under Sabrina's name.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.610
So now when I text you, it looks
like Sabrina texted you.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.846
Why? Why? Why would you do that?

04:38.912 --> 04:40.514
Because that's how
we're going to prove

04:40.581 --> 04:42.416
that Philip wants to do
more than study.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.017
Oh, now I get how it works.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.319
Kind of.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.987
(cell phone beeps)
Ooh, I'm getting a text.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.922
From you. It's a picture.

04:48.989 --> 04:49.690
Oh!

04:49.757 --> 04:52.593
Oh! Oh, my God!

04:52.660 --> 04:54.027
I should've seen that coming.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.563
BURT (chuckles):
Looky there.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.897
Like a cute
little baby seal.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.065
(laughing)

04:58.131 --> 05:00.434
Oh, I want a baby seal!

05:00.501 --> 05:03.837
(razor buzzing)

05:03.904 --> 05:04.972
Hey, guys, come into

05:05.038 --> 05:07.007
the living room;
I want to show you something.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.542
Jimmy, we're right
in the middle of...

05:08.609 --> 05:09.577
Okay, I mean, if you think
that's more important

05:09.643 --> 05:10.811
than hearing Hope say "Sabrina."

05:10.878 --> 05:12.813
(gasps)
What?!

05:12.880 --> 05:14.782
Ha!

05:27.561 --> 05:29.663
Now aren't you glad you
didn't marry a doctor?

05:29.730 --> 05:31.899
Try doing that with a tongue
depressor and a stethoscope.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.034
Jimmy could take
a lesson from this guy.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.203
Look how many times
he calls his mother.

05:36.269 --> 05:39.239
To be fair, he probably
doesn't live with his mother.

05:39.306 --> 05:40.541
Okay, okay, okay.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.746
You can do it.
You can do it.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.080
"Sabrina."

05:47.147 --> 05:49.282
I'm telling you, said it
clear as a bell ten minutes ago.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.350
SABRINA:
Can you say it?

05:50.418 --> 05:51.452
Please? Please, please, please?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.488
Ca-caw, ca-caw!

05:54.555 --> 05:55.723
Come on, I really
want to be

05:55.789 --> 05:57.124
the first fake aunt
whose name you say.

05:59.326 --> 06:00.093
Shelley.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.562
Son of a bitch!

06:02.563 --> 06:03.831
(giggles)

06:08.268 --> 06:10.738
Would you please stop reading
me and Sabrina's texts?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.506
(chuckles)
Burt, check this one out.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.575
"You stop texting first."

06:14.642 --> 06:17.110
"No, you stop texting first."

06:17.177 --> 06:19.379
"No, you stop
texting first."

06:19.447 --> 06:21.649
Whoever invented texting
must be very proud.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.116
So who stopped texting first?!

06:23.183 --> 06:25.453
We need to make sure
our fake texts to Philip

06:25.519 --> 06:27.755
sound like Sabrina, you know,
young and hip.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.657
Is it "off the hook"
and "on the chain"

06:29.723 --> 06:31.324
or "off the chain"
and "on the hook"?

06:31.391 --> 06:32.793
It's not any of those things.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.127
Just make sure
the text gets

06:34.194 --> 06:35.696
his attention
but doesn't sound too flirty.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.498
We need him
to make the first move.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.433
What if we tell him
he's "the bomb"?

06:39.500 --> 06:40.568
I feel like
that's making a comeback.

06:40.634 --> 06:41.802
Don't ask me.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.771
Ever since that UPN
went off the air,

06:43.837 --> 06:45.439
I've had trouble
learning new phrases.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.239
I got it.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.741
Careful, Virginia.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.610
You don't want to seem
wiggidy-wiggidy-wack.

06:49.677 --> 06:50.678
What are you typing?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.079
Don't send it until I...

06:52.145 --> 06:52.813
Too late.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.781
(chuckles)

06:54.748 --> 06:56.784
(cell phone beeps)

06:59.953 --> 07:02.523
Baby, your study partner
just sent you a text that says,

07:02.590 --> 07:04.658
"What's crackalackin P-lip."

07:04.725 --> 07:06.794
Your study partner
a black man from the '90s?

07:06.860 --> 07:08.596
Uh, I think she's
just messing around.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.197
Tell her I'm jumping
in the shower.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.300
(cell phone beeps)

07:13.366 --> 07:14.835
"Jumping in the shower.
Call you later."

07:14.902 --> 07:16.837
That doesn't sound flirty.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.338
Well, not if you
say it like that.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.873
But what if he texted it like,

07:19.940 --> 07:21.274
(deep voice):
"Jumping in the shower.

07:21.341 --> 07:22.643
Call you later."

07:24.745 --> 07:25.846
Yeah, that does sound flirty.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.581
So, what would Sabrina say
if you texted her,

07:27.648 --> 07:29.149
"I'm jumping in the shower"?

07:29.216 --> 07:32.185
She'd say, "No jumping in
the shower," with a winky face.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.453
And then I'd type back

07:33.521 --> 07:34.722
"LOL," even though
I'd barely "L,"

07:34.788 --> 07:36.389
and it definitely
wouldn't be "O.L."

07:36.456 --> 07:38.526
Let's try it.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.629
(cell phone beeps)

07:45.432 --> 07:46.834
"You seem..."

07:46.900 --> 07:50.037
"...very interested in
what's going on in my shower."

07:50.103 --> 07:52.005
I knew it.
I knew he's into her!

07:52.072 --> 07:55.809
"You seem very filthy.

07:55.876 --> 08:01.448
"Maybe you would
get clean faster

08:01.515 --> 08:07.087
with... four... hands."

08:09.523 --> 08:12.526
(cell phone beeps)

08:12.593 --> 08:14.762
Bitch.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.498
I hate this guy.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.534
Him? What
about Sabrina?

08:20.601 --> 08:22.469
She's the one
you should be mad at!

08:22.536 --> 08:24.504
Burt, we're Sabrina.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.073
I don't know
what you're so upset about.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.008
We're getting
all the proof we need.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.810
Now, later tonight,

08:29.877 --> 08:32.479
very calmly and rationally,
without starting a fight,

08:32.546 --> 08:35.348
you tell Sabrina what this guy's
up to and get rid of him,

08:35.415 --> 08:36.483
once and for all.

08:36.550 --> 08:37.618
(cell phone beeps)

08:37.685 --> 08:41.154
Oh, wait.
Now he's saying something.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.792
"Your idea sounds better
than showering alone.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.627
Don't go anywhere.
Coming over now."

08:46.694 --> 08:48.295
He's going to Sabrina's?

08:48.361 --> 08:49.730
No, no, no! It's too fast!

08:49.797 --> 08:51.498
She's not supposed
to find out this way!

08:51.565 --> 08:53.433
"No, do not come over!

08:53.500 --> 08:56.303
Whatever you do,
do not come over!"

08:56.369 --> 08:59.072
Where's the explanation point
on this thing?!

09:04.377 --> 09:07.180
(cell phone beeps)

09:11.852 --> 09:13.086
He's not responding!

09:13.153 --> 09:14.221
This is bad.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.789
This is bad.

09:17.591 --> 09:18.859
Oh, God!

09:18.926 --> 09:21.695
Get down from there,
you tiny home wrecker!

09:21.762 --> 09:24.632
This is very terrifying
and confusing!

09:24.698 --> 09:26.667
(screaming)

09:26.734 --> 09:27.735
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:27.801 --> 09:29.603
Hey, who are you?

09:29.670 --> 09:30.638
I'm Philip's fiancée.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.072
Uh, where is he?

09:32.139 --> 09:33.273
Come out, Philip!

09:33.340 --> 09:36.476
And face me and my mom and
my dad like a real man!

09:36.543 --> 09:37.878
Philip-- he's still
in the shower.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.680
Showering up?
(clicks tongue)

09:39.747 --> 09:41.414
I guess we're too late.

09:41.481 --> 09:44.417
He did in 15 minutes
what took you a year and a half.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.486
Wait, wait!

09:46.553 --> 09:48.756
Look, I saw the texts.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.658
Uma, there is obviously
nothing going on

09:50.724 --> 09:52.025
with her and I.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.794
I mean, she's not blond,
she's very short.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.101
Hey, hey, I speak
a little bit of French, okay?

10:01.168 --> 10:03.704
Sabrina, I'm sorry
if I misled you.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.706
I-I just came over
here to study.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.975
Look, I'm very confused
right now, okay?

10:08.041 --> 10:10.510
Confused? You texted
that you'd like to wash

10:10.577 --> 10:12.245
my fiancé's
hard-to-reach places.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.981
SABRINA:
What?!

10:16.383 --> 10:17.284
I didn't write this.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.652
Uh, I may have

10:18.719 --> 10:20.487
an explanation
for everything.

10:20.553 --> 10:24.858
(over speakers): * I've got
a lovely bunch of coconuts *

10:24.925 --> 10:25.893
Sorry.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.395
I see a button, I push a button.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.865
* Big ones, small ones,
some as big as your head *

10:31.932 --> 10:33.867
* Give them a twist... *

10:38.505 --> 10:39.539
So you see?

10:39.606 --> 10:40.808
It was all a big
misunderstanding.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.710
I take most of the
blame, of course,

10:42.776 --> 10:44.077
but, uh, I mean, Philip,

10:44.144 --> 10:46.747
you got to put a pass code
on your cell phone, man.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.149
All this ugliness
could've been avoided.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.218
Again, I'm sorry
that my boyfriend

10:51.284 --> 10:52.619
and his family are insane.

10:52.686 --> 10:53.854
That's why we need cable.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.388
We'd be happily entertained
at home

10:55.455 --> 10:57.090
and wouldn't get into
these high jinks.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.459
By the way, are these for sale?

10:59.526 --> 11:01.294
No.
Don't worry.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.063
I know what it's like when your
boyfriend has crazy parents.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.165
Philip's parents
have Rapture insurance.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.499
Yeah.

11:06.566 --> 11:07.701
That's not so weird.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.236
If you're going to get
left behind,

11:09.302 --> 11:10.738
you're going to need
some extra cash

11:10.804 --> 11:12.439
to get you through tribulation.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.608
Again, I apologize for chasing
you up on your fridge,

11:15.675 --> 11:16.710
but I do have to say

11:16.777 --> 11:18.311
you have the agility
of a squirrel.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.412
Thanks.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.848
Listen, I completely understand.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.382
And apology accepted.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.152
Plus, I didn't realize how badly
I needed to dust up there.

11:28.488 --> 11:29.790
What were you thinking?

11:29.857 --> 11:31.124
I mean, what
the hell was that?

11:31.191 --> 11:33.761
You guys snuck in
through my window?

11:33.827 --> 11:34.995
Oh, no. No, no.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.797
We used a pool skimmer,

11:36.864 --> 11:37.731
and we stayed
outside.

11:37.798 --> 11:38.799
I really
think you

11:38.866 --> 11:40.600
should mostly be mad
at Jimmy.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.670
I can give you five bucks
for this right now-- cash.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.205
No.
JIMMY:
Look, Sabrina,

11:45.272 --> 11:46.439
I am so sorry.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.076
I should have trusted you,
but my mom got involved,

11:49.142 --> 11:51.745
and then this whole thing,
it-it just spun out of control.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.747
We don't have
very active social lives.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.749
Ten dollars.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.184
Oh, Sabrina,
you're good at this.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.387
Burt, we don't want
those stupid boobs in our house.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.290
Okay, Jimmy, you know what,
we got to talk about this later,

12:03.356 --> 12:04.724
but I just...
I'm done for the night.

12:04.792 --> 12:05.926
BURT:
Okay, I'm going to try

12:05.993 --> 12:07.294
the Price is Right strategy.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.495
I bid one dollar.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.729
Just take them!

12:09.797 --> 12:10.931
Ha.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.138
What are you doing?

12:18.205 --> 12:20.407
I'm making an apology card
for Sabrina.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.708
Drawing some animals

12:21.775 --> 12:23.610
and flowers
that she really likes.

12:23.676 --> 12:24.845
Plus I'm putting my scent on it

12:24.912 --> 12:26.646
because I always get
compliments on that.

12:26.713 --> 12:27.747
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, stop.

12:27.815 --> 12:28.916
Just do one corner--
one corner.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.118
I want this card to
be from all of us.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.519
Here.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.921
Put this down for me.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.588
I'm going to go cut some
of the neighbor's flowers.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.624
Of course, if I get caught,
we'll have to make

12:37.690 --> 12:38.959
an apology card
for them, too.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.995
Whoa, whoa.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.763
You're not putting those
in here.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.132
I can't hang it in the bedroom.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.001
I'll never get any sleep.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.269
Dance, boobies.
(music plays)

12:49.336 --> 12:52.439
* I've got a lovely bunch
of coconuts... *

12:52.505 --> 12:53.640
They're tacky.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.175
(chuckles)
I like them.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.610
(knock at door)
You're the only one.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.146
(music stops)

13:01.548 --> 13:02.782
Hey, Vali.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.018
What is this thing I see

13:05.085 --> 13:07.320
through the window
on your wall?

13:07.387 --> 13:09.289
I love it.

13:09.356 --> 13:10.657
See?

13:10.723 --> 13:12.525
Our neighbor, the genie,
likes it.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.995
I'm glad you like it,
Vali. Watch this.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.030
(music plays)

13:17.097 --> 13:20.567
* I've got a lovely bunch
of coconuts... *

13:20.633 --> 13:23.070
The song
is about coconuts,

13:23.136 --> 13:25.705
which is another
word for boobs!

13:25.772 --> 13:27.774
(laughing)

13:27.841 --> 13:30.243
* Give 'em a twist... *

13:31.778 --> 13:33.981
(insect buzzing)

13:34.047 --> 13:37.650
What the hell was I thinking
bringing flowers?

13:37.717 --> 13:39.252
Do you not knock?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.454
No, I do,
but I was being chased.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.723
Oh, was it a yellow jacket
about this big?

13:43.790 --> 13:44.958
You know him?

13:45.025 --> 13:46.894
Yeah. Things used to be
bad between us,

13:46.960 --> 13:48.828
but then we came
to an understanding.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.730
Hey. You're early.

13:50.797 --> 13:52.132
Almost done studying.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.867
You want to hang out
for a minute?

13:53.934 --> 13:56.069
Uh...

13:58.371 --> 13:59.372
Where's Philip?

13:59.439 --> 14:01.041
Oh, wait. Did he not come
because of me?

14:01.108 --> 14:02.142
Oh, no, no, no, no.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.911
No, he was
driving me crazy.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.346
The guy's a French major,
so everything we learned

14:06.413 --> 14:08.681
had to be repeated
back in French.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.283
So c'est la vie.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.384
La vie.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.586
Uh, so what's the
new guy like?

14:13.653 --> 14:16.023
By the way, are there any girls
in your class or...?

14:16.089 --> 14:18.291
Oh, God. Really?
Are you jealous again?

14:18.358 --> 14:19.893
You know, I could start
studying with women,

14:19.960 --> 14:21.194
but then you'd just
start worrying

14:21.261 --> 14:22.762
I'd be hooking up with them.

14:22.829 --> 14:23.931
I could live with that.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.874
What's up, brother?

14:34.942 --> 14:37.477
Nothing much, cuz.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.645
Who are you?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.647
I'm Sabrina's boyfriend.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.915
Really?

14:41.982 --> 14:44.884
Uh, what are you,
super rich or something?

14:44.952 --> 14:46.886
Uh, no. Why?

14:46.954 --> 14:48.888
Uh, no reason.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.227
It's hot in here.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.363
No, it isn't.
Yeah, it is.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.473
They're just
studying, Jimmy.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.641
You got to stop letting
your imagination go crazy.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.810
You know what I did
every day in the men's room

15:10.877 --> 15:12.612
before work while thinking
about Sabrina?

15:12.679 --> 15:13.780
Yes.
Push-ups.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.448
Oh. Then no.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.950
And the only reason
men do push-ups

15:17.017 --> 15:18.918
is to have their arms
look big for women.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.353
But I can't say
anything to Sabrina

15:20.420 --> 15:22.155
because I already spent
my jealousy card

15:22.222 --> 15:23.823
on the whole
Philip thing.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.026
Soap.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.595
Ooh. I think we're out.

15:28.661 --> 15:29.596
Oh, don't worry.

15:29.662 --> 15:30.830
The best thing about
living with Sabrina

15:30.897 --> 15:32.165
is she has backups
of everything.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.567
Just look under
the sink.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.545
Oh, my God.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.747
Sabrina's got two
of everything.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.449
Soaps, spices,
dust buster.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.484
She's even got two
boxes of rubber gloves.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.385
That's weird.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.753
The only other person
I've ever known

15:53.820 --> 15:55.922
with that many rubber gloves
is my vagina-cologist.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.257
It all got me thinking.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.992
What if she does
the same thing with guys?

15:59.059 --> 16:00.560
She always has a backup.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.130
I was her backup with Wyatt.
Philip was her backup with me.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.198
But he wasn't into her,
so she dropped him for Randy.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.333
Hmm.
BURT:
I need

16:06.399 --> 16:08.701
more batteries
for my not so tiny dancers.

16:08.768 --> 16:09.536
Of course you need batteries.

16:09.602 --> 16:10.970
You've been playing that
for hours.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.605
You're going to wear them out.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.141
I know. I've been there.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.642
I don't even think
she realizes it.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.077
It's one of those
unconscious things

16:17.144 --> 16:18.678
where she needs guys
to want her.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.547
That's why she looks so hot
when she studies.

16:20.613 --> 16:21.814
BURT:
Oh, man!

16:21.881 --> 16:23.516
This thing takes double D's!

16:23.583 --> 16:24.684
(laughing)

16:24.751 --> 16:26.986
You guys just
keep on giving.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.855
How do I explain
to Sabrina

16:28.921 --> 16:30.023
that this guy is
just another backup?

16:30.090 --> 16:31.991
I'll seem crazy again.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.426
Well, we need to find proof.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.462
She can't call you crazy
if we have proof.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.963
Right. Right.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.031
We're going to need a plan.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.699
Right.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.568
And there's a good chance
we're going to have

16:41.634 --> 16:43.536
to steal some apology flowers
for afterwards.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.705
Probably.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.081
(toilet flushes)

16:55.848 --> 16:57.817
Oh! What the heck?

16:57.884 --> 16:59.252
Jimmy,
that's not water.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.787
That's my
contact solution.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.190
You... you drank
my contacts.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.757
No way. Did I?

17:04.824 --> 17:07.594
Oh, God.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.828
That's classic Jimmy.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.197
Oh, but it's a good thing

17:10.263 --> 17:11.664
you have your glasses
as a backup, though.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.334
Well, yeah, but I'm supposed
to study with Randy today.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.635
Well, you can do that
in glasses.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.604
I mean, it's studying,
not a fashion show.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.572
It doesn't matter
how you look.

17:19.639 --> 17:20.773
Right?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.775
Right. I...

17:26.279 --> 17:28.181
* I've got a lovely bunch
of coconuts... *

17:28.248 --> 17:29.849
Sorry to bug you, but...

17:29.916 --> 17:32.152
It's okay. I get it.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.690
Now do you see all the joy
these things bring, Virginia?

17:37.757 --> 17:40.527
And you wanted to
take them down.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.795
I have to admit,
they are kind of growing on me.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.164
I wish they would.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.032
(men laughing)

17:46.099 --> 17:48.801
No more beer
for you, Vali.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.870
And it's nice
being popular

17:50.937 --> 17:52.939
in the neighborhood
for once.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.575
I guess it's not too...

17:55.642 --> 17:57.544
Burt.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.714
What have you
taught her?

18:04.117 --> 18:07.320
(hard rock version):
* Lovely bunch of coconuts *

18:07.387 --> 18:10.823
* I've got a lovely bunch
of coconuts *

18:10.890 --> 18:13.593
(normal version):
* Lovely bunch of coconuts *

18:13.660 --> 18:17.164
* There they are
all standing in a row... *

18:17.230 --> 18:19.832
Gentlemen, go home.

18:19.899 --> 18:23.270
Go home and tell your wives
and daughters you're sorry.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.750
(knock at door)
I think your
study partner's here.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.919
SABRINA:
Tell Randy I'll be
out in a second.

18:39.986 --> 18:42.355
(electrical buzzing)

18:44.357 --> 18:46.459
(electrical buzzing)
Aah!

18:46.526 --> 18:48.828
I can't believe
I'm saying this.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.097
Get these fun, bouncy
boobs away from me.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.299
But I thought
that you...

18:52.365 --> 18:53.900
I got to keep Hope
off the pole.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.168
And she's not watching

18:55.235 --> 18:56.769
Toddlers and Tiaras
anymore, either.

18:56.836 --> 18:57.937
Randy.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.206
SABRINA:
Hi.

19:02.108 --> 19:03.576
Yes.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.777
Hey, Randy.

19:04.844 --> 19:05.845
Uh, sit down,

19:05.912 --> 19:07.347
and don't
say anything

19:07.414 --> 19:09.482
'cause it is time
to study, not chitchat.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.020
Maybe you should
put on your glasses.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.522
Oh, that's okay. I'm fine.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.390
Randy can do
the reading.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.326
You don't mind, do you, Randy?

19:19.392 --> 19:21.261
Yeah, yeah, dude.
Whatever, dude.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.263
See, Jimmy? We're fine.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.497
This is ridiculous.
Just admit it.

19:24.564 --> 19:25.698
You only don't want
to wear glasses

19:25.765 --> 19:27.234
because you want Randy
to think you're hot.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.769
Jimmy, we're not going to do
this in front of Randy, okay?

19:29.836 --> 19:31.904
That's not Randy.
That's my dad.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.344
What are you doing here?

19:37.410 --> 19:38.711
I was hoping to trade

19:38.778 --> 19:40.447
the boobs in for
something else.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.615
I'll take those hilarious
novelty glasses.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.983
Dad, we're kind of
in the middle of something.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.151
Can you just...?

19:45.218 --> 19:46.686
Okay, I'll just
browse around.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.721
Hey. Don't take
my pizza clock.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.557
Sabrina.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.091
You know how
you've got

19:52.158 --> 19:53.626
that weird thing
of keeping backups

19:53.693 --> 19:55.862
for toothpaste and
soaps and stuff?

19:55.928 --> 19:56.763
That's not that weird.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.898
Okay. Well, I
think you might be

19:58.965 --> 20:01.434
keeping backup boyfriends,
and that is kind of weird.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.035
What?
You only liked

20:03.102 --> 20:04.871
having Philip around because
you thought he was into you,

20:04.937 --> 20:07.407
and once you found out that he
wasn't, you moved on to Randy.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.675
No. That was just because

20:08.741 --> 20:10.209
he didn't insist
on speaking French.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.711
No, it was because
he's... he was obviously

20:11.778 --> 20:13.780
attracted to you, and
you wanted him to be.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.382
Otherwise, why would
you be stumbling around

20:15.448 --> 20:16.983
like Helen Keller
with no glasses?

20:19.018 --> 20:20.520
Oh, my God.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.989
Oh, my God, Jimmy, you're right.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.458
All this time, I just thought
you were acting crazy,

20:25.525 --> 20:27.727
but that...
God, why do I do that?

20:27.794 --> 20:30.730
Virginia says it's 'cause you
were raised rich and greedy.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.899
Could you just find a
knickknack and get out?

20:32.965 --> 20:33.800
You know, he didn't talk

20:33.866 --> 20:35.735
to his parents like this
till he met you.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.504
Parents.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.238
I bet I do it
because of my parents.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.873
Look, when I
was six, my dad

20:40.940 --> 20:42.642
left my mother
for absolutely no reason.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.377
And my mom would
have been devastated

20:44.444 --> 20:46.746
had she not been sleeping
with her tennis coach.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.515
I think I do it
to protect myself.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.950
I keep backups
to protect myself.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.586
If you need backups to
feel secure, keep them,

20:53.653 --> 20:55.021
because I know
that none of them

20:55.087 --> 20:57.256
is as good for
you as I am.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.459
So I know you're
not leaving me.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.661
Eventually, you're
going to realize that

21:01.728 --> 21:04.897
and decide that you don't
need backups anymore.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.666
You know what?

21:06.733 --> 21:09.035
I think I'm realizing that
right now.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.305
Sorry.
What?

21:12.372 --> 21:14.607
I just can't make out
with Mr. Magoo.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.710
Well, I can't see
anything, so I hope

21:17.777 --> 21:20.747
you don't get mad
if I call you Philip.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.758
I love
my grandma.
