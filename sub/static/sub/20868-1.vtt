08:14.910 --> 08:17.110
'cause I'm skeptical on that "legal" shit.

08:17.112 --> 08:18.944
What? Man, it ain't nothing like that.

08:18.946 --> 08:21.281
Alright? They know we just want the hookup.

08:21.283 --> 08:24.418
You need to stop smoking that
whack-ass weed. Got you paranoid.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.353
We gonna get our medication, brother.

08:26.355 --> 08:29.423
Yeah you right. What illness
you gonna go with though?

08:29.425 --> 08:31.024
You know what? I been thinking about it.

08:31.026 --> 08:32.259
I'm gonna keep it simple, man.

08:32.260 --> 08:35.698
I'm gonna say I got
migraines and depression.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.563
You call that simple?

08:37.565 --> 08:38.900
Those near death symptoms.

08:39.734 --> 08:40.832
Hmm.

08:40.835 --> 08:42.433
What illness you gonna go with?

08:42.436 --> 08:44.072
Loss of appetite. Period.

08:44.973 --> 08:46.575
You gonna say you got your period?

08:47.575 --> 08:48.575
Man that is mean.

08:48.577 --> 08:49.576
I'm messing with you, man.

08:49.578 --> 08:51.110
I know what you meant.

08:51.112 --> 08:52.446
It's a joke, damn.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.879
Loss of appetite, that's good, man.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.850
'Cause can't nobody
tell you when you hungry.

08:56.852 --> 08:59.351
You can't. Like, ask me "Am I hungry."

08:59.353 --> 09:00.419
You hungry?

09:00.421 --> 09:01.788
Yeah, I'm hungry.

09:01.790 --> 09:03.255
Alright, let me ask you again.

09:03.257 --> 09:04.291
You hungry?

09:04.293 --> 09:05.558
Nah, I ain't hungry.

09:05.560 --> 09:07.327
That's good as hell. Man, I
should have thought of that.

09:07.329 --> 09:08.698
I told you. You can't think of...

09:18.906 --> 09:20.609
- Hi guys!
- What they do?

09:21.510 --> 09:23.011
I'm gonna need to see your photo IDs.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.245
And have you sign in.

09:26.247 --> 09:28.881
Come on... I told you we need an ID man.

09:28.883 --> 09:31.152
Don't worry about it. I got that.

09:37.392 --> 09:38.827
Thank you.

09:44.132 --> 09:45.130
Look.

09:45.132 --> 09:47.067

09:47.069 --> 09:48.802
- When he was on his feet.
- Damn.

09:48.804 --> 09:50.405
Way before he was rolling.

09:51.372 --> 09:52.572
- You goin' to hell.
- Alright.

09:52.574 --> 09:54.374
The doctor will be with you momentarily.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.643
You goin' first. You the
one got me acting like this.

09:56.645 --> 09:58.345
- No I don't, man.
- I ain't never said nothing

09:58.347 --> 09:59.578
about no handicapped people to you.

09:59.580 --> 10:01.548
Okay. You are all set.

10:01.550 --> 10:04.484
Feel free to give us a call if you
have any questions about your card

10:04.486 --> 10:06.286
or your medicine, okay?

10:06.288 --> 10:09.722
Alright, so your total
for the visit is $125.

10:09.724 --> 10:11.490
$25 for the card and the paperwork,

10:11.492 --> 10:13.058
and $20 for the medicine.

10:13.060 --> 10:15.061
Can you add all that up for me, honey?

10:15.063 --> 10:16.328
$170.

10:16.330 --> 10:17.798
$170?

10:17.800 --> 10:21.100
I ain't spend no $170
dollars on no damn card, bro.

10:21.102 --> 10:22.936
That's a whole quarter ounce right there.

10:22.938 --> 10:23.970
Would you keep calm?

10:23.972 --> 10:25.871
The card said everything for $50.

10:25.873 --> 10:27.275
That's still a eighth.

10:28.510 --> 10:30.110
Look, do you wanna grow our own shit,

10:30.112 --> 10:31.644
or do you wanna just keep complaining,

10:31.646 --> 10:33.779
and getting ripped off?

10:33.781 --> 10:35.648
I gotta think about that
shit, man. I don't know.

10:35.650 --> 10:38.018
Okay, gentlemen.

10:38.020 --> 10:39.922
- You go first.
- What?

10:41.323 --> 10:42.755
Are you two together?

10:42.757 --> 10:43.992

10:45.026 --> 10:45.892
Yes.

10:45.894 --> 10:47.661
Yeah, we together.

10:47.663 --> 10:48.760
The doctor will see you both.

10:48.762 --> 10:50.197
- Cool.
- That's her...

10:50.199 --> 10:51.967
- Around the corner.
- Where do we go?

11:01.642 --> 11:02.708
Doctor.

11:02.710 --> 11:03.909
I appreciate that.

11:03.911 --> 11:05.413
It smell good. It smell like free sex.

11:06.414 --> 11:08.282
Hi, guys. How you doin?

11:08.284 --> 11:09.849
Chill, man.

11:09.851 --> 11:11.018
Yeah, help yourself.

11:11.020 --> 11:12.052
Thank you.

11:12.054 --> 11:12.954
So...

11:14.689 --> 11:15.925
Are you together?

11:16.657 --> 11:18.193
Yeah, we here together.

11:18.959 --> 11:19.994
Hmm.

11:21.362 --> 11:23.028
Just looking real careful.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.734
I like to know, who's the fem?

11:26.700 --> 11:27.600
The fem? What the...

11:27.602 --> 11:28.504
It's you, right?

11:29.136 --> 11:30.202
Hell no.

11:30.204 --> 11:32.141
He had an incident when
he was little though.

11:34.476 --> 11:36.509
Let's just move on.

11:36.511 --> 11:37.880
Can I... can I hit that?

11:38.612 --> 11:40.379
Yeah. Mm!

11:40.381 --> 11:41.416
Oh yeah?

11:42.117 --> 11:43.017
Let me try.

11:43.953 --> 11:44.886
No.

11:46.054 --> 11:48.120
No, I can't give you a hit of this. Sorry.

11:48.122 --> 11:50.956
Not until you're officially diagnosed

11:50.958 --> 11:53.128
and prescribed your medication.

11:54.429 --> 11:55.396
A'ight.

11:56.765 --> 11:59.198
What can I do for you?

11:59.200 --> 12:02.302
- Well...
- I been having a lack of appetite.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.602
Really affecting me.

12:03.604 --> 12:05.871
You stole my illness, nigga!

12:05.873 --> 12:07.475
I was supposed to use loss of appetite!

12:08.676 --> 12:10.009
And you eatin' all that.

12:10.011 --> 12:11.446
You can't have a loss of
appetite eatin' all that!

12:12.713 --> 12:13.879
Stupid.

12:13.881 --> 12:17.383
You can both have the appetite thing, okay?

12:17.385 --> 12:19.088
Let me write that down.

12:19.954 --> 12:21.323
"Lack of appetite."

12:25.327 --> 12:28.695
You know what? You look like Mr. Ed.

12:28.697 --> 12:30.797
These are actually for me.

12:30.799 --> 12:32.331
- Oh, sorry.
- They're not for patients

12:32.333 --> 12:34.100
coming in here and helping themselves.

12:34.102 --> 12:35.000
Doc, they were so close...

12:35.002 --> 12:36.302
Okay, that's alright.

12:36.304 --> 12:37.703
Is there anything else?

12:37.705 --> 12:39.438
Well, like I got shot...

12:39.440 --> 12:41.173

12:41.175 --> 12:43.376

12:43.378 --> 12:45.345

12:45.347 --> 12:47.013

12:47.015 --> 12:48.447
...and I shit on myself sometimes.

12:48.449 --> 12:49.716
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:49.718 --> 12:50.683
Alright.

12:50.685 --> 12:52.085
That's disgusting.

12:52.087 --> 12:53.885
You don't need any more reasons.

12:53.887 --> 12:56.022
I'm just fucking with you. Come on.

12:56.024 --> 12:57.593
You seem like great guys.

13:00.061 --> 13:01.563
Okay, there you go, boys.

13:30.625 --> 13:32.091
What's wrong with you, man?

13:32.093 --> 13:34.394
You can't just flaunt it

15:01.782 --> 15:03.216
You weren't in the rap game, man!

15:45.193 --> 15:50.496

and focus?

16:03.411 --> 16:05.445
A'ight, find a low-crime area...

16:05.447 --> 16:08.048
...for your grow room.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.849
You don't want to bring
other people's attention

16:09.851 --> 16:11.716
or problems to you.

16:11.718 --> 16:12.686
Well that just shut us out

16:12.688 --> 16:15.254
'cause everybody around us is criminals.

16:15.256 --> 16:19.024
Step two, live where you grow.

16:19.026 --> 16:21.094
Get to know your neighbors.

16:21.096 --> 16:22.260
Is it a Panamera?

16:22.262 --> 16:23.429
- Panamera Porsche.
- Look man,

16:23.431 --> 16:25.163
would you stop fucking
focusing on that bullshit

16:25.165 --> 16:27.267
and figure out how we can
get some damn start-up cash?

16:27.269 --> 16:28.701
Is that like "extra cash"?

16:28.703 --> 16:32.105
Look man, we gotta get like a
small business loan or something.

16:32.107 --> 16:33.605
How your credit?

16:33.607 --> 16:35.041
I mean, it ain't bad.

16:35.043 --> 16:36.775
- Good.
- It ain't good, neither.

16:36.777 --> 16:40.113
I still got that jet ski.
That's like a carpet stain.

16:40.115 --> 16:43.482
Every time you clean it
up, shit get dirty again.

16:43.484 --> 16:45.818
All I got is a truck in my
shed, and I'm like, only like,

16:45.820 --> 16:47.387
five or six payments behind and I...

16:47.389 --> 16:49.556
Ain't nobody gonna give us no goddamn loan.

16:49.558 --> 16:52.325
Come on, man. Now's not
the time to be doubtful.

16:52.327 --> 16:54.126
Look how close we is, man.

16:54.128 --> 16:56.095
And we won't know nothing

This America!

16:57.299 --> 16:58.898
Is it our America though?

16:58.900 --> 17:00.166
We're African-American.

17:00.168 --> 17:01.634
It's America.

17:01.636 --> 17:03.135
Fuck if it's our America.

17:03.137 --> 17:04.537
We sellin' that damn weed.

17:04.539 --> 17:07.271
And the green fucking rush is real.

17:07.273 --> 17:09.942
A'ight? Like the old school gold rush.

17:09.944 --> 17:11.376
This our time brotha!

17:11.377 --> 17:12.511
- Okay.
- You understand that?

17:12.512 --> 17:14.079
You wanna say "we shall overcome"?

17:14.080 --> 17:15.848
We shall overcome!

17:15.849 --> 17:17.348
<i>Hey, you wanna hit this?</i>

17:17.351 --> 17:19.487
- <i>We can't go in no bank high.</i>
- <i>Too late.</i>

17:21.556 --> 17:23.056
Yo, I been banking here for years.

17:23.058 --> 17:24.291
So that should help.

17:25.425 --> 17:27.093
Good evening gentlemen.

17:27.095 --> 17:29.962
- Hey how you doin...
- What's up, boy?

17:29.964 --> 17:32.464
And now let me check in here for a sec.

17:32.466 --> 17:33.401
Uh-huh.

17:35.636 --> 17:36.635
Alright. Okay.

17:36.637 --> 17:38.840
You guys are here seeking capital and...

17:39.807 --> 17:40.839
- ...tell me about it.
- Oh yeah.

17:40.841 --> 17:42.808
So I'm here looking to
get a little seed money

17:42.810 --> 17:44.676
- to get my business off the...
- Seed money.

17:44.678 --> 17:45.780
...ground.

17:47.115 --> 17:48.617
- Some seed money.
- Yes.

17:49.817 --> 17:50.817
My bad.

17:50.819 --> 17:51.718
As the business grows...

17:51.720 --> 17:54.320
we can pay back...

17:54.322 --> 17:57.626
"Grows". That's a good one.
You killed me with that.

17:57.925 --> 17:59.261
"Grows".

17:59.993 --> 18:00.960
Are you guys okay?

18:00.962 --> 18:01.961
Oh, yeah!

18:01.963 --> 18:03.229
We just excited!

18:03.231 --> 18:05.397
You know, to get the grassroots
of this company going,

18:05.399 --> 18:07.700
you know what I mean? Get
our feet firmly planted,

18:07.702 --> 18:10.702
that way we can branch out
to help the whole community.

18:10.704 --> 18:11.839
Branch.

18:13.575 --> 18:16.075
I see. Let me just ask you this.

18:16.077 --> 18:18.510
What kind of business are you
guys really trying to start?

18:18.512 --> 18:20.579
- Medical consulting...
- Tax consulting...

18:20.581 --> 18:21.647
Say what?

18:21.649 --> 18:23.281
He's new to the name.

18:23.283 --> 18:25.285
He's part of the company.
We got him from The Bahamas.

18:25.287 --> 18:26.653
He's from The Bahamas?

18:26.655 --> 18:28.221
Oh he just started. He's in
training for the business.

18:28.223 --> 18:30.423
And we also need a little
extra money for that too.

18:30.425 --> 18:31.891
Well good luck on that.

18:31.893 --> 18:34.359
So we got it? Yeah!

18:34.361 --> 18:35.894
Mr. White, you will not be sorry.

18:35.896 --> 18:37.230
That's not what I said.

18:37.232 --> 18:39.899
I've been looking through your
history and your records here

18:39.901 --> 18:41.200
and it just seems as though...

18:41.202 --> 18:43.403
I don't really think I'm going
to be able to get this bank

18:43.405 --> 18:45.404
to approve a loan for you guys.

18:45.406 --> 18:48.039
Wait, what did my history
say? You lookin' at my history?

18:48.041 --> 18:49.442
Your history, sir, is that...

18:49.444 --> 18:53.211
you're already like $756
overdrawn in your account.

18:53.213 --> 18:55.381
Only thing consistent is for two years,

18:55.383 --> 18:57.049
you do have a bank balance.

18:57.051 --> 18:58.584
Nineteen thou...

18:58.586 --> 19:00.789
$19.87.

19:02.089 --> 19:05.191
Nineteen dollars? You
can't take that out the ATM.

19:05.193 --> 19:07.394
That's stuck in there, bro.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.163
Close that, right? Now
let's say that's closed,

19:10.165 --> 19:11.431
and keep your mind open.

19:11.433 --> 19:14.469
It's been hard on me.
It's been hard on America.

19:15.169 --> 19:16.736
Especially African-Americans.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.104
Boom!

19:18.106 --> 19:20.707
- African.
- Bro.

19:20.709 --> 19:22.909
You guys really... You're
really taking up my time.

19:22.911 --> 19:23.942
You know what, I really do...

19:23.944 --> 19:25.010
Oh, taking up your time?

19:25.012 --> 19:26.178
I have real customers, thank you.

19:26.180 --> 19:27.516
You mean white customers.

19:28.982 --> 19:30.351
Say, he don't like that.

19:31.519 --> 19:33.385
- I don't like you.
- Grown Gangsta don't play that.

19:33.387 --> 19:34.487
- You don't like me?
- No.

19:34.489 --> 19:36.221
- You Grown Gangsta?
- Fuck you!

19:36.223 --> 19:37.990
- Fuck me?
- Wait a second!

19:37.992 --> 19:41.027
- I need Darius right now.
- I don't give a fuck. Fuck him.

19:41.029 --> 19:42.497
That's Grown Gangsta!

19:45.133 --> 19:46.298
Thanks, Mr. White.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.034
That's why you comb your hair backwards.

19:48.036 --> 19:50.936
You old mothafucka. His old ass.

19:50.938 --> 19:53.306
Asshole and asshole light.

19:53.308 --> 19:54.843
Shake up out of here.

20:05.219 --> 20:07.653
Okay, we need somebody that got money

20:07.655 --> 20:10.823
to give us some money 'cause
they know we gonna make money,

20:10.825 --> 20:12.090
and they smoke weed.

20:12.092 --> 20:13.558
They definitely gonna have to smoke weed

20:13.560 --> 20:15.696
'cause you gonna have to be high
as hell to loan us some money.

20:16.330 --> 20:17.765
Somebody that love weed,

20:18.532 --> 20:20.400
and wanna make some extra cash.

20:20.402 --> 20:23.501
Brah, when you gonna stop
saying this extra cash shit.

20:23.503 --> 20:25.371
Ain't no such thing called extra cash.

20:25.373 --> 20:26.939
You got extra hos,

20:26.941 --> 20:28.740

20:28.742 --> 20:29.741
extra ass...

20:29.743 --> 20:30.710
Somebody...

20:30.712 --> 20:32.211
There ain't no such
thing as extra cash, bro.

20:32.213 --> 20:34.579
Somebody we could pay back in weed.

20:34.581 --> 20:35.614
You know, it's funny you say...

20:35.616 --> 20:36.883
I just thought about something.

20:36.885 --> 20:39.285
That's the perfect candidate
to loan us the money.

20:39.287 --> 20:41.119
- I know who we can get.
- Who?

20:41.121 --> 20:42.622
The king of weed.

20:42.624 --> 20:43.589
Who?

20:43.591 --> 20:48.795
<i>♪ Snoop Doggy Dogg
Oh you know it. ♪</i>

See I hit that note.

20:49.864 --> 20:51.297

Do Snoop wanna invest

No that wasn't a joke, I really love Snoop.

23:02.129 --> 23:03.429
You know what I love, too?

23:03.431 --> 23:04.829

You said you was gonna

23:13.441 --> 23:16.241
Ooh, I knew his ass wasn't shit.

23:16.243 --> 23:18.012
Got caught cheating underwater.

23:18.413 --> 23:19.945
Mm.

23:19.947 --> 23:21.580
Everybody knew it. That's why
the show's called <i>Shadies.</i>

23:21.582 --> 23:24.284
It's shady people on there that
get caught from doing shady shit.

23:24.286 --> 23:27.886
Okay, well all I'm saying
is don't let me catch you.

23:27.888 --> 23:29.253
Catch me what?

23:29.255 --> 23:30.758
On a episode of <i>Shadies.</i>

23:31.425 --> 23:32.724
Come on now, baby.

23:32.726 --> 23:33.826

Yeah whatever. If you love me so much

23:35.664 --> 23:37.762

23:37.764 --> 23:39.498
For real... Uh-uh, I'm good.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.799
I'm catching hell from these people

23:40.801 --> 23:43.569
since I already told 'em
it was ready for donation.

23:43.571 --> 23:45.837
It'll be finished before
you go to work tomorrow.

23:45.839 --> 23:49.208
They sure is greedy to be so goddamn needy.

23:49.210 --> 23:51.877
Uh-uh. That is not funny. Okay?

23:51.879 --> 23:54.212
I really have a soft spot
for people in my heart

23:54.214 --> 23:56.749
who don't have the things
that we take for granted.

23:56.751 --> 23:58.916
What we take for granted?
We ain't got shit!

23:58.918 --> 24:01.453
You seen where I live

24:01.455 --> 24:03.721
- Oh, baby, guess what.
- What's that?

24:03.723 --> 24:06.358
My boss gave me two new
properties to manage.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.660
For real?

24:07.662 --> 24:09.662
While these people get evicted
from they home in Bel-Air

24:09.664 --> 24:12.332
took the sink and trashed the whole house.

24:12.334 --> 24:13.598
Can you believe that?

24:13.600 --> 24:15.200
How they expect you to rent that shit out?

24:15.202 --> 24:17.970
I don't know. I'm gonna have
to find somebody to fix it.

24:17.972 --> 24:20.471
The owner is some old guy living in Miami.

24:20.473 --> 24:22.008
He ain't thinking 'bout that place.

24:22.010 --> 24:24.112
Better yet. That's a hard
job to do. I don't know how...

24:25.613 --> 24:28.617
Oh shit. Hold up. Baby
I thought of something.

24:29.116 --> 24:30.849
Oh God. What?

24:30.851 --> 24:33.652
Why don't they let me do
that shit? Let me fix it.

24:33.654 --> 24:36.888
Oh my god... Darius, knock it off.

Okay, so how am I supposed to

24:47.601 --> 24:49.768
Cause this is my job on the line.

24:49.770 --> 24:51.569
You don't trust your boy?

24:51.571 --> 24:53.774
No, I don't trust you.

24:54.209 --> 24:55.974
Shoot.

24:55.976 --> 24:57.643
- What am I gonna get out of it?

25:01.214 --> 25:03.615
Whatever he give me, whatever
I can put in my pocket

25:03.617 --> 25:04.884

Kay. Uh...

33:21.848 --> 33:23.251
Two, four...

33:24.151 --> 33:25.416
We need twenty.

33:25.418 --> 33:26.720
Well, twenty!

33:27.988 --> 33:30.255
E-I-E-I-O!
Old Macdonald!

33:30.257 --> 33:33.325
That is not a garden. That is a plantation.

33:33.327 --> 33:34.726
- What?
- Plantation?

33:34.728 --> 33:37.528
Nah, man. We talkin' 'bout
like, Whole Foods, like uh...

33:37.530 --> 33:40.399
Mother Earth is dying. Like we
need to save this planet, man.

33:40.401 --> 33:45.270
We tryin' to grow like swiss
chard, quinoa, and kale.

33:45.272 --> 33:46.305
That way we... yeah.

33:46.307 --> 33:48.006
Okay, okay. I get it.

33:48.008 --> 33:51.175
Exactly what are you guys thinking
of using for the feeding system?

33:51.177 --> 33:54.278
What kind gives you, like, big ass kale?

33:54.280 --> 33:55.846
What kind do you suggest?

33:55.848 --> 33:57.916
Follow me.

33:57.918 --> 33:59.184
Just the thing. We like to hear that.

33:59.186 --> 34:00.451
I would go with something like this.

34:00.453 --> 34:02.820
In fact you can integrate a timer system

34:02.822 --> 34:05.390
to work with the lighting
setup that I showed you

34:05.392 --> 34:06.759
with the feeding setup.

34:06.761 --> 34:08.993
Yeah, that sound about like
what we're trying to do.

34:08.995 --> 34:10.562
Damn right. Everything all on a timer,

34:10.563 --> 34:13.998
and all we gotta do is sit
back and watch our... kale?

34:14.001 --> 34:15.600
Alright, so...

34:15.601 --> 34:16.900
Wrap up everything you showed us

34:16.902 --> 34:18.101
and we can get the hell out of here.

34:18.103 --> 34:19.837
You're forgetting about the soil.

34:19.839 --> 34:21.839
Can't we just use dirt as soil?

34:21.841 --> 34:25.275
Well yes! Absolutely... not.

34:25.277 --> 34:28.080
That would be like putting
spinners on a brand new Bentley.

34:28.081 --> 34:29.681
You could, but I wouldn't.

34:29.684 --> 34:31.683
I would. What's wrong
with that? That's nice.

34:31.685 --> 34:33.583
- You would put spinners on a Bentley?
- Yes I would.

34:33.585 --> 34:35.020
Now I would go with the rockwool here.

34:35.022 --> 34:37.089
This is perfect for indoor growing.

34:37.091 --> 34:39.322
Will really keep the insects out.

34:39.324 --> 34:41.125
Yeah that's nice. Okay, so...

34:41.127 --> 34:42.694
I guess that's all "ne weed."

34:42.696 --> 34:44.328
We can go on get outta here.

34:44.330 --> 34:46.297
Man, you just said weed, man!

34:46.300 --> 34:47.331
Didn't say weed.

34:47.333 --> 34:48.331
Didn't he just say "ne weed"?

34:48.333 --> 34:49.900
I heard "ne weed".

34:49.902 --> 34:51.569
You is a nosy mothafucka, man.

34:51.571 --> 34:53.572
But you sound like you
know what you talkin' 'bout.

34:54.540 --> 34:56.674
Who are you?

34:56.676 --> 35:00.779
I'm the guy that's gonna get
you guys all the stuff you need

35:00.781 --> 35:02.013
delivered to your house,

35:02.015 --> 35:03.881
set it up, for the best price in LA.

35:03.883 --> 35:04.982
No shit.

35:04.984 --> 35:06.317
That's who the fuck I am.

35:06.319 --> 35:08.252
Alright now we would have
been over this by now, guys,

35:08.254 --> 35:09.520
if you were for real with me.

35:09.522 --> 35:11.323
Alright? I'm not the fucking police.

35:11.325 --> 35:13.959
Alright and I'm sure
as hell ain't your mama.

35:13.961 --> 35:16.428
Now all we gotta talk about is...

35:16.430 --> 35:17.595
my cut.

35:17.597 --> 35:21.299
Damn... alright.

35:21.301 --> 35:22.837
We'll be right back.

35:25.504 --> 35:27.138
I think we should rob his ass.

35:27.140 --> 35:29.240
Okay, look. He's pretty for real, man.

35:29.242 --> 35:30.408
What we gonna give him?

35:30.410 --> 35:33.111
I'm ready to rob. Fuck it. He white anyway.

35:33.113 --> 35:34.845
Let's get this done, man.

35:34.847 --> 35:36.046
What you think?

35:36.048 --> 35:37.415
Let's just pay him in weed.

35:37.417 --> 35:39.319
Alright, let's pay him in weed.

35:40.053 --> 35:41.455
Alright.

35:42.722 --> 35:47.894
How does seven pounds of
our best organic kale sound?

35:49.095 --> 35:50.664
That sounds delicious.

35:51.231 --> 35:52.464
Got yourself a deal.

35:52.466 --> 35:53.467
Deal!

35:55.202 --> 35:56.334
You good? My man!

35:56.336 --> 35:57.468
We good, we good.

35:57.470 --> 35:59.203
- Cool. Cool.
- Alright, listen.

35:59.205 --> 36:00.571
You guys head home.

36:00.573 --> 36:01.573
I'm gonna be hooking you up

36:01.575 --> 36:03.209
with a guy named Conspiracy Chris.

36:03.211 --> 36:05.243
He's gonna get you
everything you need. Okay?

36:05.245 --> 36:08.516
Now let's go. Let's get outta
here. I got security cameras.

36:14.988 --> 36:16.223

36:52.126 --> 36:55.593

36:55.595 --> 36:57.129
That gotta be double good.

36:57.131 --> 36:58.529
I think that's double voodoo.

36:58.531 --> 37:01.200
Whatever. I'll keep it to myself
then since you such a hater.

37:01.202 --> 37:02.634

37:10.644 --> 37:13.078

37:13.080 --> 37:14.482

- Yeah, that's right.

37:15.214 --> 37:16.647
Two Patrick Hills?

37:16.649 --> 37:18.015
I only got one of you guys on here.

37:18.017 --> 37:19.517
I'm Patrick Hill, man.

37:19.519 --> 37:20.651
I would have called your ass

37:20.653 --> 37:22.622
but Matt says you don't keep no cell phone.

37:23.656 --> 37:24.855
No.

37:24.857 --> 37:27.491
Feds are just lettin' people
track themselves for them.

37:27.493 --> 37:30.328
Then they hack into your
phone, they take photos.

37:30.330 --> 37:31.662
Sick motherfuckers.

37:31.664 --> 37:33.196
My girl used to go through my phone.

37:33.198 --> 37:34.466
She was working for the feds.

37:34.468 --> 37:36.401
I think she do 'cause she
went through my phone too.

37:36.403 --> 37:38.535
Hold on to this. I'mma...

37:38.537 --> 37:40.373
- Don't mind if I do.
- ...start unloading.

37:42.776 --> 37:43.877
This is amazing.

37:52.452 --> 37:53.754
Go get to know our neighbors.

37:56.122 --> 37:57.357
Go!

38:01.928 --> 38:03.064
Garage.

38:09.002 --> 38:10.438
Whoa, shit!

38:11.705 --> 38:13.874
Oh hello, neighbor. I'm sorry. Hello.

38:14.975 --> 38:16.077
Neighbor?

38:17.377 --> 38:19.109
Are you shittin' me?

38:19.111 --> 38:21.014
You been drinkin' good, huh?

38:25.919 --> 38:28.285
Alright. Well, uh...

38:28.287 --> 38:30.921
we just moved over here so...

38:30.923 --> 38:33.524
You mean, my Henry sold
this house to you. Oh!

38:33.526 --> 38:36.361
No, no, no. Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

38:36.363 --> 38:37.962
We're just leasing. We're just leasing.

38:37.964 --> 38:39.497
Oh. Oh thank you, Jesus.

38:39.499 --> 38:40.665
You don't like black people?

38:40.667 --> 38:42.167
I do not like black people.

38:42.169 --> 38:43.437
What the...

38:44.203 --> 38:45.906
I love black people!

38:47.240 --> 38:48.676
Okay. Okay.

38:52.513 --> 38:54.712
Oh, okay. I get it. I get it.

38:54.714 --> 38:56.781
You wanted Henry, but he left.

38:56.783 --> 38:59.116
Okay. I could see why you would do that.

39:02.455 --> 39:05.122
You young people, you think
that you know everything.

39:05.124 --> 39:06.524
But I been hit that.

39:06.526 --> 39:08.325
You been hit?

39:08.327 --> 39:10.630
You people, you sure
do need a lot of light.

39:11.897 --> 39:12.997
You people?

39:12.999 --> 39:17.000
Oh no, the light is just
better to see you, my dear.

39:17.002 --> 39:19.069
Oh, that is so cute.

39:19.071 --> 39:20.270
Yeah.

39:20.272 --> 39:21.740
You're just like a big bad wolf.

39:21.742 --> 39:23.308
Yeah. Yeah.

39:25.912 --> 39:26.810
So um...

39:26.812 --> 39:27.714
Uh-huh.

39:28.481 --> 39:29.716
You're not married?

39:30.184 --> 39:31.149
Nah.

39:31.151 --> 39:32.283
Oh, oh good.

39:32.285 --> 39:34.218
Nobody want to put a ring on it.

39:34.220 --> 39:36.388
- No.
- Oh good. Okay.

39:36.390 --> 39:37.589
Just stay right...

39:37.591 --> 39:38.859
Where am I staying?

39:40.493 --> 39:41.526
What was that for?

39:41.528 --> 39:42.761
- Don't worry about it.
- Focus!

39:42.763 --> 39:46.600
I have to go take care of
some grown up woman biz...

39:48.435 --> 39:53.437
I will be seeing you around,
you young BBC wolf, you.

39:53.439 --> 39:56.174
BBC wolf? What's that?

39:56.176 --> 40:00.544
Big... bad... chocolate... wolf.

40:00.546 --> 40:03.214
Hey, I'm up here. I'm up here. I'm up here!

40:03.216 --> 40:04.517
- Stay.
- What?

40:06.519 --> 40:07.919
Hey, hey, hey!

40:07.921 --> 40:09.053
Come back here.

40:09.055 --> 40:10.223
Hey don't send that to no blog site now.

40:14.193 --> 40:15.727
What the hell she want?

40:15.729 --> 40:16.627
This dick!

40:16.629 --> 40:18.129
Man, stop playin, man.

40:18.131 --> 40:20.198
Nah, for real! She was talking
about the man that lived here before

40:20.200 --> 40:22.167
and tellin' me how big my
dick is and how she loved me

40:22.169 --> 40:24.069
and how she wanna air me
out, this that and whatever.

40:24.071 --> 40:25.736
Get out of here, man. I don't
have time for your damn games.

40:25.738 --> 40:27.272
The bitch molested me and everything

40:27.274 --> 40:29.307
with a camera phone and all that shit.

40:29.309 --> 40:30.707
Talking 'bout some BBC wolf.

40:30.709 --> 40:32.678
She tried to take advantage of me, bro!

40:32.680 --> 40:35.145
Now I see how sexy, attractive,
Miss America people feel.

40:35.147 --> 40:36.881
- What's a BBC wolf?
- Shit, I don't know.

40:36.883 --> 40:39.183
Look, you're gonna have
to stay on her, man.

40:39.185 --> 40:41.653
Keep a close watch. I'mma watch
that chick that was joggin' earlier.

40:41.655 --> 40:43.522
Why I gotta go with the
Benjamin Button looking lady?

40:43.524 --> 40:44.692
Handle that.

40:54.200 --> 40:56.368
I'm glad we did these windows over man.

40:56.370 --> 40:57.868
This is much better.

40:57.870 --> 41:01.872
Man I had no idea all this went
into growing some damn weed.

41:01.874 --> 41:03.540
- Hey guess what?
- What's that?

41:03.542 --> 41:05.142
I'mma call this The Mother Room.

41:05.144 --> 41:06.477
That's dope.

41:06.479 --> 41:09.214
Good thing we had Sleepy-Head
over here to help us set it up.

41:09.216 --> 41:12.183
I see you, Dick. No, Dick.

41:12.185 --> 41:13.919
That's right. I see you, Dick.

41:13.921 --> 41:16.120
Whoa, man. What is going on with him?

41:16.122 --> 41:17.756
Nah, maybe you shouldn't wake him up.

41:17.758 --> 41:19.059
Put it in your mouth.

41:20.193 --> 41:21.892
That's right. Choke on it, motherfucker.

41:21.894 --> 41:23.694
Put it in your mouth.

41:23.696 --> 41:24.930
Nope, put it in your mouth.

41:24.932 --> 41:25.866
Hey! Yo yo!

41:26.765 --> 41:27.933
What's wrong with you?

41:27.935 --> 41:29.433
What happened?

41:29.435 --> 41:31.002
You was having some freaky-ass dream.

41:31.004 --> 41:32.904
Talkin' 'bout dicks and there
ain't nothing but men in the room.

41:32.906 --> 41:35.506
That was Dick Cheney. I was
waterboarding Dick Cheney.

41:35.508 --> 41:36.709
I got him to confess.

41:37.211 --> 41:38.408
Confess to what?

41:38.410 --> 41:39.944
That he killed Biggie and Pac.

41:39.946 --> 41:41.979
You with... I told you it was like that.

41:41.981 --> 41:43.714
You just crazy. That's what that is.

41:43.716 --> 41:47.986
I was just proving the point that you
can get anyone to confess to anything.

41:47.988 --> 41:50.187
Do you understand? Torture's a bitch.

41:50.189 --> 41:52.557
Man, just get your ass up
so we can finish this room.

41:52.559 --> 41:53.758
Oh my God, that was a crazy dream.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.426
My ass hurts. What does that mean?

41:55.428 --> 41:58.332
That means you need to get up and
finish The Mother Room, Conspiracy Chris.

41:59.765 --> 42:00.968
Kick him in his ass again.

42:02.401 --> 42:03.703
You kicked me in my ass?

42:05.705 --> 42:07.605
We're good to go.

42:07.607 --> 42:09.374
- Okay. Alright.
- Alright.

42:09.376 --> 42:12.310
Oh no, no. Hold on. We're not finished yet.

42:12.312 --> 42:15.046
Somebody still has to go up and
connect the cables and then we're done.

42:15.048 --> 42:16.314
What?

42:16.316 --> 42:18.183
Why the hell you just didn't
connect it while you was up there?

42:18.185 --> 42:20.051
I don't get why we have to steal power.

42:20.053 --> 42:22.453
It ain't like we gotta pay
for the bill to begin with.

42:22.455 --> 42:25.223
So the power company doesn't
see a huge spike in usage.

42:25.225 --> 42:27.892
And they tell the owners.
And the owners tell police.

42:27.894 --> 42:29.160
Yeah, that ain't good.

42:29.162 --> 42:31.863
I can't have my girlfriend getting fired.

42:31.865 --> 42:34.298
Fired? That happen we going to jail, bro.

42:34.300 --> 42:36.334
Why didn't you just connect
them while you was up there?

42:36.336 --> 42:39.203
Oh, no, no, no. It's
your grow, it's your show.

42:39.205 --> 42:41.673
I don't execute the
connection. I just wire it up.

42:41.675 --> 42:42.973
Is it dangerous?

42:42.975 --> 42:44.174
It's not dangerous. I mean the power's off

42:44.176 --> 42:46.243
so you're totally good. It's just policy.

42:46.245 --> 42:48.913
And also stealing power is totally illegal.

42:48.915 --> 42:50.147
So what do we have to do?

42:50.149 --> 42:52.183
Somebody's gonna climb up this ladder...

42:52.185 --> 42:53.250
Mhmm.

42:53.252 --> 42:55.419
...and then you're gonna
connect the red clamp

42:55.421 --> 42:56.787
to the cable with the black tape

42:56.789 --> 42:58.490
and then you're gonna
connect the black clamp

42:58.492 --> 42:59.558
to the cable with the white tape.

42:59.560 --> 43:00.825
Got it, got it.

43:00.827 --> 43:01.926
And then we'll turn the power back on

43:01.928 --> 43:03.394
and we're ready to get growin'.

43:03.396 --> 43:07.131
Let's do this thing. Darius,
give me that flashlight, bro.

43:07.133 --> 43:10.368
Alright, I'mma hold it steady
while you climb up there.

43:10.370 --> 43:12.837
I thought you said you was
in charge of electricity.

43:12.839 --> 43:14.506
I am but I'm scared of heights, man.

43:14.508 --> 43:15.843
Come on. Knock it out.

43:21.414 --> 43:23.383
Get up there. Look at ya.

43:24.350 --> 43:25.385
Like a little monkey.

43:31.323 --> 43:32.490
What'd you say?

43:32.492 --> 43:35.225
Put the red clamp on the black cable,

43:35.227 --> 43:38.263
and the black clamp on the white cable.

43:38.265 --> 43:39.732
Alright.

43:43.569 --> 43:45.368
Oh! Oh!

43:45.370 --> 43:46.406
Move back!

43:53.513 --> 43:54.479
You okay?

43:54.481 --> 43:55.412
Shit!

43:55.414 --> 43:56.816
D?

43:57.216 --> 43:58.149
D?

43:58.151 --> 43:59.984
Man, D. Don't do this to me, homie.

43:59.986 --> 44:02.354
More like we did this to him.

44:02.356 --> 44:03.421
You know CPR?

44:03.423 --> 44:04.488
I know THC.

44:06.459 --> 44:08.060
Hope that's not the police.

44:08.062 --> 44:10.297
Do something... like pump his chest
or something. Get that mothafucka up.

44:18.437 --> 44:19.837
Hi, um...

44:19.839 --> 44:21.238
I heard a loud noise

44:21.240 --> 44:23.607
and then I saw a big light
flash coming from this direction

44:23.609 --> 44:24.908
- so I thought this would be...
- Here?

44:24.910 --> 44:28.314
Yeah here... the perfect
time to come introduce myself.

44:28.848 --> 44:30.214
Hi, I'm Madison.

44:30.216 --> 44:31.415
Hey. Pat.

44:31.417 --> 44:32.853
Nice to meet you.

44:33.685 --> 44:34.752
Are you okay?

44:34.754 --> 44:35.819
I'm fine. I'm great.

44:35.821 --> 44:37.388
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah!

44:37.390 --> 44:38.492
Your friend.

44:39.591 --> 44:40.924
- You sure?
- Yeah, positive.

44:40.926 --> 44:43.261
Well what... is your friend okay?

44:43.263 --> 44:45.462
Oh yeah. They in love.

44:45.464 --> 44:46.897
They been arguing all day,

44:46.899 --> 44:48.165
he just laid down on the ground.

44:48.167 --> 44:49.767
He was like, "I don't wanna talk to you."

44:49.769 --> 44:51.435
Are you okay? You seem a little nervous.

44:51.437 --> 44:54.071
'Cause you came over here
all late and I get scared.

44:54.073 --> 44:55.607
- Okay.
- Nice meetin' you!

44:55.609 --> 44:56.874
Another time, promise. I'll talk
to you in, like, the daytime.

44:56.876 --> 44:58.879
I'm a daytime person.

45:00.981 --> 45:01.745
Okay.

45:01.747 --> 45:02.712
He's gone, man.

45:02.714 --> 45:03.915
He gone? Gone where?

45:03.917 --> 45:06.017
It's unbelievable, man.
He's definitely dead.

45:06.019 --> 45:07.053
What?

45:08.220 --> 45:09.386
Amazing.

45:09.388 --> 45:11.522
Amazing?

45:11.524 --> 45:12.624
Why when something tragic happen

45:12.626 --> 45:13.924
white people try and make it sound cool?

45:13.926 --> 45:15.560
It's not amazing that my friend is dead!

45:15.562 --> 45:17.861
No, I mean it can be tragic and amazing.

45:17.863 --> 45:19.062
This... It's...

45:19.064 --> 45:21.098
I get it. I know what
you're going through, man.

45:21.100 --> 45:22.935
I mean, this is the third one.

45:24.203 --> 45:25.272
What'd you say?

45:26.305 --> 45:27.904
Two...

45:27.906 --> 45:30.308
Two other guys died the same way.

45:30.310 --> 45:31.942
- Like this?
- Mhmm.

45:31.944 --> 45:34.145
You said it was safe! You said it was safe!

45:34.147 --> 45:35.779
We don't have time for this, man!

45:35.781 --> 45:37.816
I mean, he's gonna start decomposing soon.

45:37.818 --> 45:38.984
Decomposing?

45:38.986 --> 45:41.319
Yeah, he's gonna start rotting...

45:41.321 --> 45:43.421
smell up our grow house.

45:43.423 --> 45:46.223
Our grow house? Ain't
no more damn grow house.

45:46.225 --> 45:48.493
Alright? My friend's laying here dead.

45:48.495 --> 45:49.761
Now shut up and let me think.

45:49.763 --> 45:52.129
Look man. Thinking isn't gonna
bring him back to life, okay.

45:52.131 --> 45:53.129
We gotta...

45:53.131 --> 45:55.765
Look, his little hands are all balled up.

45:55.767 --> 45:56.933
It's rigormortis.

45:56.935 --> 45:58.535
No they were always balled up like that.

45:58.537 --> 45:59.437
We gotta bury him.

45:59.439 --> 46:02.040
Don't you touch him! Don't touch him!

46:02.042 --> 46:03.475
- We have...
- Don't you touch him.

46:03.477 --> 46:04.743
We're not burying him.

46:04.745 --> 46:06.513
Okay, we'll take it slow. Let's uh...

46:09.182 --> 46:11.017
I'm gonna say a little prayer.

46:13.852 --> 46:15.118
For Darius.

46:15.120 --> 46:20.390
A fallen comrade who
died too young, too short,

46:20.392 --> 46:22.792
small in stature but...

46:22.794 --> 46:24.063
big in spirit.

46:24.631 --> 46:26.464
A great man.

46:26.466 --> 46:28.535
A man who... whose heart

46:29.635 --> 46:32.336
was much bigger than his body.

46:32.338 --> 46:35.209
He stood for the betterment of pot for all.

46:38.211 --> 46:40.280
This goes to you, buddy. Wherever you are.

46:46.352 --> 46:47.785
Oh my... God?

46:47.787 --> 46:49.821
God? Is that God? God?

46:49.823 --> 46:51.756
What is it? Yes, my son?

46:51.758 --> 46:53.491
Oh, Darius. My son.

46:53.493 --> 46:54.725
Am I dead?

46:54.727 --> 46:56.394
So that means I'm dead. I'm dead?

46:56.396 --> 46:58.363
Now thou shall have known it was janky

46:58.365 --> 47:00.298
when thou seeneth them jumper cables.

47:00.300 --> 47:01.966
What the hell was you thinkin', boy?

47:01.968 --> 47:04.334
So is that a yes? 'Cause you confused me.

47:04.336 --> 47:06.669
Not exactly. I'm thinking about it though.

47:06.671 --> 47:08.605
I mean, you got potential but,

47:08.607 --> 47:09.607
you gotta stop labor trickin'

47:09.609 --> 47:11.609
and go out there and
pursue your dreams, my son.

47:11.611 --> 47:12.576
You know about that too?

47:12.578 --> 47:13.778
I know about everything.

47:13.780 --> 47:15.913
Even things that no one else knows about.

47:15.915 --> 47:18.415
Like your big grown ass
having a gangsta mix tape.

47:18.417 --> 47:19.850
You know, you too old for that, boy.

47:19.852 --> 47:21.886
So you saying I should
pursue my music career?

47:21.888 --> 47:23.587
Hell no!

47:23.589 --> 47:25.823
There's too many people out there
downloading music illegally anyway.

47:25.825 --> 47:27.457
And I know who all y'all are.

47:27.459 --> 47:29.929
I'mma deal with you later. Believe that.

47:30.796 --> 47:31.895
Pat.

47:31.897 --> 47:33.566
- Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat...
- What?

47:34.001 --> 47:35.636
- Look.
- Darius!

47:36.803 --> 47:38.672
Darius! What happened?

47:39.738 --> 47:41.974
I smoked,

47:42.508 --> 47:43.406
then I blew it out,

47:43.408 --> 47:45.442
and then he started coming back to life.

47:45.444 --> 47:46.946
So blow some more smoke!

47:48.981 --> 47:50.080
But I do like what you're doin'

47:50.082 --> 47:52.049
on the front lines of this cannabis battle.

47:52.051 --> 47:54.017
I put weed here for you to enjoy.

47:54.019 --> 47:56.053
And for those who need it.

47:56.055 --> 47:57.390
Keep fightin' the good fight.

47:58.057 --> 47:59.592
Now go back, my son.

48:00.526 --> 48:01.560
<i>Darius!</i>

48:04.631 --> 48:05.632
D, get up!

48:06.432 --> 48:07.332
I smell weed.

48:07.334 --> 48:09.299
- That's this weed.
- Yeah!

48:09.301 --> 48:11.134
I brought him back to life!

48:11.136 --> 48:13.303
You back, man! You back!

48:13.305 --> 48:15.939
Aw shit! We're back in business.

48:15.941 --> 48:18.244
Is that all that matters to you? Business?

48:19.144 --> 48:20.513
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:21.481 --> 48:22.714
Okay.

48:22.716 --> 48:24.984
I'm just glad you're okay,
man. You're my friend.

48:26.720 --> 48:29.285
Oh man! D!

48:29.287 --> 48:30.656
Rabbit's foot did it again.

48:31.423 --> 48:32.455
You gonna believe.

48:32.457 --> 48:33.323
I guess it did, man.

48:33.325 --> 48:34.892
- It did.
- I really think it was the weed.

48:34.894 --> 48:36.727
- So did it work?
- The rabbit's foot?

48:36.729 --> 48:38.194
No. The electricity.

48:38.196 --> 48:40.932
I forgot to tell you that after
you hit that main switch off,

48:40.934 --> 48:42.799
there's a little bit of
zip left in the lines.

48:42.801 --> 48:44.067
I went ahead and connected those wires

48:44.069 --> 48:45.604
so that that doesn't happen again.

48:46.606 --> 48:48.040
Thank you now.

48:48.508 --> 48:49.573
Yeah, no problem.

48:49.575 --> 48:50.674
So I guess we back on track.

48:50.676 --> 48:51.711
Don't do that.

48:53.613 --> 48:54.678
You sure you good?

48:54.680 --> 48:55.546
A little.

48:55.548 --> 48:57.180
Alright that's good, man. Okay.

48:57.182 --> 49:02.285
Step five: Electricity, lights,
and fan installations. Done.

49:02.287 --> 49:06.524
Step six: Feeding systems,
reservoirs, and tubing connected.

49:06.526 --> 49:07.558
Done.

49:07.560 --> 49:10.294
All we gotta do now is we
gotta set up the filters,

49:10.296 --> 49:12.395
then we gotta pick up the
plants and bring 'em in.

49:12.397 --> 49:13.397
When you guys come here in the morning

49:13.399 --> 49:15.232
we should be all up and running.

49:15.234 --> 49:16.767
Alright. Lemme hit that blunt.

49:16.769 --> 49:17.935
I think I need that right now.

49:17.937 --> 49:19.870
My friend was just dead and now he's back.

49:19.872 --> 49:22.173
Y'know, life is good!

49:22.175 --> 49:23.307
I wouldn't be mad if I saw

49:23.309 --> 49:25.877
another jumper cable ever again in my life.

49:25.879 --> 49:27.414
Shit!

49:29.015 --> 49:30.381
You didn't crank that shit up, did you?

49:30.383 --> 49:32.883
No, not yet. Is it working?

49:32.885 --> 49:35.021
If I... wait till I say crank it up.

49:38.091 --> 49:39.622
- Now?
- Hold on!

49:39.624 --> 49:41.427
Ain't feelin' to get electrocuted again.

49:44.696 --> 49:45.796
Alright try it now.

49:48.635 --> 49:50.301
Yes! Thank you, baby!

49:50.303 --> 49:52.002
- Finally!
- Can I do it?

49:52.004 --> 49:53.306
- Yes.
- Can I do it?

49:54.673 --> 49:55.774
Stop it.

49:55.776 --> 49:57.774
Alright I'm about to head
over to the Bel-Air house

49:57.776 --> 49:59.042
and get started on this work.

49:59.044 --> 50:00.444
Okay listen, I got all that stuff

50:00.446 --> 50:01.845
that you checked off on the list

50:01.847 --> 50:04.147
but my boss wants to know
like what's the estimated time

50:04.149 --> 50:05.616
you think that the house is gonna be ready?

50:05.618 --> 50:09.252
Well we just finished doing the
general cleanup and shit, so...

50:09.254 --> 50:10.921
I guess once the sink come in

50:10.923 --> 50:12.388
we can get started with everything else.

50:12.390 --> 50:13.924
But that's gonna take about ten weeks.

50:13.926 --> 50:15.993
Ten weeks? Baby that's a long time!

50:15.995 --> 50:17.428
Shit gotta get shipped in,

50:17.430 --> 50:18.928
and mailed in, that take about...

50:18.930 --> 50:20.932
That's six weeks in itself.

50:20.934 --> 50:23.868
God. Alright well I'll let him know.

50:23.870 --> 50:26.404
It should be done in mid-April though.

50:26.406 --> 50:29.140
I am so happy you fixed
the van for me, baby.

50:29.142 --> 50:30.575
What you gonna do for it though?

50:30.577 --> 50:32.779
Oh God. You know it's going to
help a special person, right?

50:33.446 --> 50:34.414
I know that.

50:35.848 --> 50:37.415
- Alright.
- You are so amazing.

50:37.417 --> 50:39.950
Listen, I'm gonna have somebody
come later and pick up the van.

50:39.952 --> 50:41.553
- Alright?
- Alright cool.

50:41.555 --> 50:45.089
I gotta go to the... office real
quick for a fast meeting at work.

50:45.091 --> 50:46.223
Bye baby. Gotta go.

50:46.225 --> 50:47.758
Well if it isn't ratchet and the tramp.

50:47.760 --> 50:49.296
Your booty getting bigger.

50:51.765 --> 50:53.830
You just gonna ignore my phone call, nigga?

50:53.832 --> 50:55.700
Give me a ride, man.

50:55.702 --> 50:57.701
Fuck them, we ain't scared of him.

50:57.703 --> 50:58.769
Go, nigga!

50:58.771 --> 51:00.337
Keep runnin! Keep runnin!

51:00.339 --> 51:01.638
- You good, man.
- Hurry up, man.

51:01.640 --> 51:03.408
- We lost them niggas.
- No we didn't.

51:03.410 --> 51:05.843
We were in a high speed
chase with a wheelchair.

51:05.845 --> 51:07.245
He almost caught us, man.

51:07.247 --> 51:08.546
He almost caught you.

51:08.548 --> 51:10.180
So what if he woulda jumped on us, man?

51:10.182 --> 51:11.415
You weren't gonna help me?

51:11.417 --> 51:13.183
You want me to jump on a
handicapped dude with you?

51:13.185 --> 51:14.519
Ain't nothing wrong with him, man.

51:14.521 --> 51:17.423
Anyway, I seen you get your
little labor trickin' kiss.

51:18.124 --> 51:19.326
You know what you can kiss?

51:19.725 --> 51:20.924
My whole ass.

51:20.926 --> 51:23.593
Oh shit there, mammy. One of
your lyrics from your mix-tape.

51:23.595 --> 51:24.361
Which one?

51:24.363 --> 51:25.995
<i>♪ I told you 'bout kissin' ♪</i>

51:25.997 --> 51:28.267

51:28.968 --> 51:30.234
Yeah, I remember that shit.

51:30.236 --> 51:32.502
Look man, last night when you was dead,

51:32.504 --> 51:34.671
that bad chick we seen
jogging came by the crib.

51:34.673 --> 51:37.008
Rang the doorbell. Said
she heard an explosion.

51:37.010 --> 51:38.142
What'd you do? You ain't...

51:38.144 --> 51:39.276
What you talking 'bout?

51:39.278 --> 51:40.278
You ain't bust none.

51:40.280 --> 51:41.578
I didn't, man. What I look like?

51:41.580 --> 51:43.381
Smashin' some random hot chick

51:43.383 --> 51:45.917
while my boy layin' on the ground dead.

51:45.919 --> 51:47.250
- A pimp?
- Yeah you right.

51:47.252 --> 51:50.520
Oh by the way, your boy
Chris picked up clones.

51:50.522 --> 51:52.823
Meetin' us at the crib right now.

51:52.825 --> 51:57.627
Okay, all the timers are
set to eighteen hours.

51:57.629 --> 52:00.131
Light timers and the food timers set, too.

52:00.133 --> 52:01.198
Cool.

52:01.200 --> 52:02.466
You're not gonna need that pamphlet.

52:02.468 --> 52:05.035
Nah he does. He's growin' weed for noobs.

52:05.037 --> 52:07.604
And it's symbolic. A'ight?

52:07.606 --> 52:10.342
Step seven: The plants are all in.

52:10.877 --> 52:13.611
Ready, set, grow!

52:13.613 --> 52:14.681

53:37.930 --> 53:40.332
Hey yo! Yo yo! Wake up, man.

53:41.434 --> 53:42.966
There's something growin' on the plants.

53:42.968 --> 53:44.868
Those are called buds.

53:44.870 --> 53:46.703
We're gonna smoke them eventually.

53:46.705 --> 53:50.542
I know what that is, but this
some gray moldy type shit.

53:52.544 --> 53:53.512
Look.

53:56.249 --> 53:58.048
That's mold.

53:58.050 --> 53:59.183
Shit.

53:59.185 --> 54:00.651
I just told you that was
mold, man. What the...

54:00.653 --> 54:03.522
Alright, I'm gonna go to the
truck and get a sulfur burner.

54:14.401 --> 54:15.702
Good morning.

54:23.408 --> 54:25.542
So what made all that mold grow?

54:25.544 --> 54:28.312
That's just what happens
when the pH levels get crazy.

54:28.314 --> 54:29.645
Gotta keep your eye on it.

54:29.647 --> 54:31.850
That gotta be tough when
you sleep all the time, huh?

54:32.718 --> 54:34.151
What are you talking 'bout?

54:34.153 --> 54:37.187
Uh, my grandma told me back in
the day, like if you pee on it

54:37.189 --> 54:38.921
that'll make all the mold go.

54:38.923 --> 54:40.022
Your grandma grew weed?

54:40.024 --> 54:41.125
- Hey!
- Doesn't work.

54:41.127 --> 54:43.794
Everything that you put on
the plants is what you smoke.

54:43.796 --> 54:44.694
Don't do that.

54:44.696 --> 54:46.296
Do you pee with your pants down?

54:46.298 --> 54:48.765
How else do you pee? Don't
y'all pee with y'all pants down?

54:48.767 --> 54:49.933
That's why you have a zipper.

54:49.935 --> 54:52.071
That's not a thing that normal people do.

54:52.972 --> 54:54.171
What's that smell?

54:54.173 --> 54:56.272
Well the sulfur has a funny smell to it.

54:56.274 --> 54:58.142
Pussy has a funny smell.

54:58.144 --> 54:59.243
That shit stink.

54:59.245 --> 55:00.511
You'll get used to it.

55:00.513 --> 55:01.678
Pull your pants up.

55:02.981 --> 55:04.247
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know. I'mma go check.

55:04.249 --> 55:05.750
Nuh-uh.

55:05.752 --> 55:08.352
You stay here. I got it. Don't pee on it!

55:08.354 --> 55:10.754
You'll get used to the smell.
Let's go check on the other plants.

55:10.756 --> 55:12.492
- Can I pee in there?
- No.

55:14.026 --> 55:16.593
Hey neighbor! How you doin'?

55:16.595 --> 55:17.495
Hi.

55:17.497 --> 55:19.796
Look, I just wanted to come back here

55:19.798 --> 55:21.799
and tell you how rude you were to me.

55:21.801 --> 55:23.466
- Come on.
- You slammed the door in my face,

55:23.468 --> 55:24.769
you didn't invite me in,

55:24.771 --> 55:26.837
and honestly, I was just
being a concerned neighbor.

55:26.839 --> 55:29.339
Okay, I'm sorry.

55:29.341 --> 55:30.674
Ja...

55:30.676 --> 55:32.642
- Madison.
- Madison!

55:32.644 --> 55:34.044
- I'm sorry, Madison.
- You forgot.

55:34.046 --> 55:35.111
Nah, I didn't forget!

55:35.113 --> 55:36.245
It's okay.

55:36.247 --> 55:37.381
Madison, it was a crazy night.

55:37.383 --> 55:39.116
- I saw that you had a crazy...
- Crazy night.

55:39.118 --> 55:40.383
...situation going on back there.

55:40.385 --> 55:43.086
Yeah it was wild back
there. But it's done now.

55:43.088 --> 55:45.254
- See?
- Are they okay?

55:45.256 --> 55:46.423
Everybody's great, yeah.

55:46.425 --> 55:47.593
- Okay.
- Everybody's good.

55:48.026 --> 55:49.660
I'm Pat.

55:49.662 --> 55:51.729
Yeah, you said that.
Remember? The other night?

55:51.731 --> 55:53.296
- That's what you did to me.
- Oh.

55:53.298 --> 55:54.798
I do that... we do that.

55:54.800 --> 55:57.968
Why are you such a nervous person?

55:57.970 --> 56:00.004
You're either really nervous naturally,

56:00.006 --> 56:02.673
or you're hiding something
terrible in this house.

56:02.675 --> 56:04.374
Just because you think we crazy,

56:04.376 --> 56:05.508
I'm gonna invite you in.

56:05.510 --> 56:06.843
Are you sure?

56:06.845 --> 56:08.044
I'm sure.

56:08.046 --> 56:09.412
Are you good?

56:09.414 --> 56:10.948
Yeah. As normal as I can be.

56:10.950 --> 56:11.848
- Okay.
- Alright.

56:11.850 --> 56:13.950
This is... this is
really nice. I like this.

56:13.952 --> 56:15.919
It is. It's nice.

56:15.921 --> 56:17.456
In here. Wonderful.

56:21.593 --> 56:23.796
This is beautiful though. I love it.

56:24.564 --> 56:25.732
Yes it is beautiful.

56:26.798 --> 56:27.832
Sorry.

56:27.834 --> 56:29.536
I'm talkin' about the house.

56:30.002 --> 56:31.871
Pat! Oh!

56:33.506 --> 56:36.138
My bad. I didn't know we had company.

56:36.140 --> 56:37.209
Oh.

56:39.044 --> 56:40.109
- Hey.
- Hello.

56:40.111 --> 56:41.111
- Hi.
- How you doin'?

56:41.113 --> 56:43.946
I think I met you or saw
you rather the other day.

56:43.948 --> 56:45.214
Oh, for real? Where?

56:45.216 --> 56:47.484
Well it looked like you were
getting mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

56:47.486 --> 56:50.620
It was. I was getting
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

56:50.622 --> 56:52.656
He has this medical condition

56:52.658 --> 56:55.058
that he can only be revived
by a man with a beard.

56:55.060 --> 56:57.394
Hey, Chris needs you upstairs
to help him out with something.

56:57.396 --> 56:58.761
- Can you handle that?
- For real?

56:58.763 --> 57:00.696
Can you handle that? The
white man needs the black man.

57:00.698 --> 57:02.098
- Go on up there.
- I'll be right back. Alright?

57:02.100 --> 57:03.068
Take your time.

57:07.406 --> 57:08.939
What's up, I'm Darius.

57:08.941 --> 57:10.307
I'm Madison.

57:10.309 --> 57:11.707
You can call me Dah-rius.

57:12.979 --> 57:15.613
What the hell is goin' on?
Can you wait one second?

57:15.615 --> 57:16.980
- Okay.
- Just one second. I'll be...

57:21.086 --> 57:22.319
Hey, boo. What you need?

57:22.321 --> 57:25.256
What do I need? Boy get out
the way. This ain't your house.

57:25.258 --> 57:26.323
What you doing?

57:26.325 --> 57:27.725
Oh.

57:27.727 --> 57:29.459
Who the hell is this bitch?

57:29.461 --> 57:31.694
Huh? Got on her little
workout gear and shit?

57:31.696 --> 57:33.596
What the hell's going
on? Y'all workin' out?

57:33.598 --> 57:34.865
Um, excuse me.

57:34.867 --> 57:37.234
Do I look like I workout? Look at me!

57:37.236 --> 57:41.004
I knew it! Alright, every
man is a shady-ass cheater!

57:41.006 --> 57:41.971
Alright?

57:41.973 --> 57:43.941
That is such a blanket statement to make.

57:43.943 --> 57:45.676
You can't just say every man is a...

57:45.678 --> 57:48.111
Bitch, I don't need your two cents, okay?

57:48.113 --> 57:49.513
I know how niggas are.

57:49.515 --> 57:50.680
- Especially this one.
- Oh.

57:50.682 --> 57:52.283
What the fuck, bitch? I'm Grown Gangsta!

57:52.285 --> 57:53.950
Oh, you a gangsta, huh? You gangsta?

57:53.952 --> 57:55.819
You can't be rollin'
up in here acting all...

57:55.821 --> 57:57.988
I will do whatever the hell
I wanna do up in this house.

57:57.990 --> 57:59.355
- Okay?
- Look, you need to calm down.

57:59.357 --> 58:01.424
Okay, you know what? It
was really nice to meet you.

58:01.426 --> 58:04.361
Yeah you better be going before
I have to put hands on you.

58:04.363 --> 58:05.629
Stop, don't do that. Calm down.

58:05.631 --> 58:06.629
You better watch out.

58:06.631 --> 58:07.698
Tell Pat I said goodbye.

58:07.700 --> 58:09.466
- Bye, bitch!
- Leave before you die.

58:09.468 --> 58:10.466
- Bye!
- Calm your ass down.

58:10.468 --> 58:11.535
Why you acting like...

58:13.006 --> 58:13.904

other bitches up in here!

58:17.142 --> 58:18.075
Ain't nobody up in here.

You better watch out!

58:18.977 --> 58:20.243
- Calm down! Calm down!
- Where you at?

58:20.245 --> 58:21.178
Come here! Come here!

58:21.180 --> 58:22.879
Don't play with me.
You better let go of me!

58:22.881 --> 58:26.316
- Stop. Stop!
- I know you got a bitch in here.

58:26.318 --> 58:28.218
Stop! Stop! Stop!

58:43.868 --> 58:47.069
Got me taking care of
this weed they left here.

58:47.071 --> 58:48.372
Ain't that stupid?

58:48.374 --> 58:50.207
Oh, so you must think I'm stupid.

58:50.209 --> 58:52.542
It's cool. 'Cause you

58:52.544 --> 58:53.843
Make sure she doesn't call the police!

58:53.845 --> 58:55.879
- I got you.
- You got a side boo?

58:55.881 --> 58:57.281
Hold up! I was gonna tell you!

58:57.283 --> 59:01.352
When? Huh? After you smoked
it all? After you sold it?

59:01.354 --> 59:02.919
Huh? After a fucking police raid?

59:02.921 --> 59:04.453
You wasn't gonna tell me shit.

59:04.455 --> 59:05.788
- Calm down!
- You was gonna tell me

59:05.790 --> 59:07.024

59:07.026 --> 59:08.526
- Huh? What bitch?
- Oh, "huh"! "Huh"!

59:08.528 --> 59:09.729
That's what I thought.

59:10.196 --> 59:11.627
Fuck you Darius!

59:11.629 --> 59:12.761
Alright? Fuck you!

59:12.763 --> 59:14.096
I'mma show you what it's like when you

59:14.098 --> 59:16.031

59:16.033 --> 59:17.734
Then you wanna start some grow house?

59:17.736 --> 59:19.502
And you wasn't gonna cut me in?

59:19.504 --> 59:21.270
It's not like that if you listen...

59:21.272 --> 59:22.973
You know what? It's over.

59:22.975 --> 59:24.707
Okay. I'mma show you what it's like

59:24.709 --> 59:25.776

And let me tell you something,

59:27.178 --> 59:29.348

59:30.115 --> 59:31.915
Huh? What did you say?

59:31.917 --> 59:34.618
I think she said that
you were her side boo.

59:34.620 --> 59:36.153
Man, shut the fuck up.

59:36.155 --> 59:37.287
- Hey man.
- You asked.

59:37.289 --> 59:38.624
Look, fuck that.

59:39.223 --> 59:41.024

59:41.026 --> 59:42.859
- She'll be back.
- Does she own a gun?

59:42.861 --> 59:44.330
Nah, nah. I took all of the bullets.

59:45.164 --> 59:46.198
But she owns a gun?

59:47.265 --> 59:48.866
Hey! Hey baby!

59:48.868 --> 59:50.870
Make sure she really left.

59:54.372 --> 59:56.506
Man, I don't know what's
going on with the filter.

59:56.508 --> 59:57.741
Something's wrong, man.

59:57.743 --> 59:59.142
It should be sucking out
the heat along with the weed

59:59.144 --> 01:00:00.109
and the sulfur smell.

01:00:00.111 --> 01:00:03.147
Man, for real. It is
hot as shit in here, man!

01:00:03.149 --> 01:00:04.682
This how I know I could never be a slave.

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:05.950
Man, I have to be a house nigga.

01:00:05.952 --> 01:00:07.316
Fuck that outside shit good.

01:00:07.318 --> 01:00:10.020
And why would the tenants take
the air condition unit anyway?

01:00:10.022 --> 01:00:11.888
How else you gonna have a grow room?

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:13.790
That's so disrespectful, man.

01:00:13.792 --> 01:00:15.591
I'm a Buddhist, man. I'm a Buddhist.

01:00:15.593 --> 01:00:17.361
I need to be on top of a mountain,

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:18.928
the cool breeze,

01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:20.830
leaves blowing in the wind...

01:00:20.832 --> 01:00:21.997
I think I'm blacking out.

01:00:21.999 --> 01:00:23.399
I'm gonna go open the front door.

01:00:23.401 --> 01:00:24.935
Let a little heat out.

01:00:24.937 --> 01:00:26.272
Yeah that's a good idea.

01:00:31.042 --> 01:00:32.875
Tell the guys that I'll be back.

01:00:32.877 --> 01:00:34.712
Yeah, uh-huh. You better get goin!

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:35.948
That's what I thought.

01:00:37.883 --> 01:00:39.084
There you go, baby.

01:00:44.488 --> 01:00:46.858
Mm-hnmm! I'm back. Now what?

01:00:47.593 --> 01:00:49.093
Oh don't look shocked, okay?

01:00:49.095 --> 01:00:51.962
'Cause I told your lame
ass I was coming back.

01:00:51.964 --> 01:00:54.497
Listen, why the hell
is it so hot up in here?

01:00:54.499 --> 01:00:55.732
What you doin' here with him?

01:00:55.734 --> 01:00:59.102
Oh no. The question is
what was I doing with you.

01:00:59.104 --> 01:00:59.903
Hey! Hey!

01:00:59.905 --> 01:01:00.904
What's going on, baby?

01:01:00.906 --> 01:01:02.673
Oh you 'bout to find out. Alright?

01:01:02.675 --> 01:01:06.075
And I told your ass to
stop calling me baby.

01:01:06.077 --> 01:01:09.412
So you think you just
gonna drive off without me?

01:01:09.414 --> 01:01:10.916
And that's the end of the story?

01:01:12.084 --> 01:01:13.718
- Keep the gun on him.
- Oh no, I got him.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.986
Stop waving that goddamn
gun like that. Put it down!

01:01:15.988 --> 01:01:18.758
Shut the fuck up. She put the gun
wherever I say she put the gun.

01:01:19.725 --> 01:01:21.491
Look...

01:01:21.493 --> 01:01:23.127
what's up, Reg? What you need?

01:01:23.129 --> 01:01:24.361
What do I need?

01:01:24.363 --> 01:01:25.962
He's my man, fool.

01:01:25.964 --> 01:01:27.964
He got more authority in here than you do.

01:01:27.966 --> 01:01:29.866
- Reg your man now?
- Yeah.

01:01:29.868 --> 01:01:31.868
Look, man. I don't know
what she told you about me.

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:33.602
Oh, now he don't know what I done told...

01:01:33.604 --> 01:01:34.805
This is what she told me.

01:01:34.807 --> 01:01:37.241
There's two bitch-ass niggas...

01:01:37.243 --> 01:01:38.676
- Yup, yup!
- ...with little-ass hands

01:01:38.678 --> 01:01:41.812
that was trying to cut her out
of her portion of the weed money.

01:01:41.814 --> 01:01:43.245
- The money? The weed money?
- Yup.

01:01:43.247 --> 01:01:46.250
And I said, "Wait a minute,
that sounds familiar".

01:01:46.252 --> 01:01:48.151
'Cause you know that shit immoral.

01:01:48.153 --> 01:01:51.455
You always trying to fuck somebody
out of what's rightfully theirs.

01:01:51.457 --> 01:01:52.555
What the fuck?

01:01:52.557 --> 01:01:53.857
- You tryin' to fuck her out her weed money?
- Yup.

01:01:53.859 --> 01:01:55.928
You tried to fuck me out of walking.

01:01:56.662 --> 01:01:57.961
I go to get us some weed

01:01:57.963 --> 01:02:01.096
and while I'm gone somebody shoots you?

01:02:01.098 --> 01:02:03.033
It ain't my fault you in
the goddamn wheelchair.

01:02:03.035 --> 01:02:04.267
You say wheelchair again,

01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:07.404
I'll roll this motherfucker
into your ass cavity.

01:02:07.406 --> 01:02:09.540
Man, you just saying that 'cause you
know I ain't gonna do nothing to you

01:02:09.542 --> 01:02:11.844
'cause you sittin' in that
goddamn wheelchair. Man, fuck it.

01:02:12.743 --> 01:02:14.243
Oh no, baby!

01:02:14.245 --> 01:02:15.611
Oh, get him!

01:02:20.752 --> 01:02:22.519
Now we're here. Oh yeah!

01:02:22.521 --> 01:02:24.587
- Get this shit off me!
- Get up baby! Don't let his little ass...

01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:25.756
Hey stay your ass over there!

01:02:25.758 --> 01:02:26.723
I'mma get you!

01:02:26.725 --> 01:02:28.091
Hold his... Stop that!

01:02:28.093 --> 01:02:29.158
What's wrong with you?

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.560
I could shoot him right now, baby.

01:02:30.562 --> 01:02:31.729
One more wiggle!

01:02:31.731 --> 01:02:32.830
Oh!

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.466
Alright. Alright. That's enough.

01:02:36.468 --> 01:02:37.834
Whoo!

01:02:37.836 --> 01:02:39.569
Let's make a deal.

01:02:39.571 --> 01:02:41.307
Now let's talk business, nigga.

01:02:51.684 --> 01:02:52.915
Yo!

01:02:56.655 --> 01:02:57.620
What happened? Shit!

01:02:57.622 --> 01:02:58.622
Shit!

01:02:58.624 --> 01:02:59.622
What happened?

01:02:59.624 --> 01:03:00.656
Oh man.

01:03:00.658 --> 01:03:02.892
You was giving it to Reg's ass, man!

01:03:02.894 --> 01:03:04.060
A left, a right.

01:03:04.062 --> 01:03:06.529
You was Darius Mayweather
in this mothafucka.

01:03:06.531 --> 01:03:07.629
Did I win?

01:03:07.631 --> 01:03:08.899
Nah, man.

01:03:08.901 --> 01:03:11.801
He got you on the floor. That was it.

01:03:11.803 --> 01:03:13.035
Where they go?

01:03:13.037 --> 01:03:14.738
They in the other room.

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.242
I'm fuckin' with you! I'm fuckin'
with you! I'm fuckin' with you!

01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:18.341
They left, man.

01:03:18.343 --> 01:03:19.676
They better have left.

01:03:19.678 --> 01:03:21.078
Yeah they got outta here.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.812
Good news and bad news.

01:03:22.814 --> 01:03:26.348
Bad news, I had to cut
that nigga in on a deal.

01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:30.587
Good news is, you and
Reg, that shit squashed.

01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:32.154
Hold up, so you let him roll on us?

01:03:32.156 --> 01:03:33.857
You let him roll over on you.

01:03:33.859 --> 01:03:35.459
He rolled you left, he rolled you right.

01:03:35.461 --> 01:03:38.060
That man is strong from the
waist up, man. You don't know.

01:03:38.062 --> 01:03:39.928
He was strong from the hips up.

01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:41.899
He fucking your girl, man.

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:43.533
Whatever, man. She'll fuck anything.

01:03:43.535 --> 01:03:45.602
I don't even fuck with
her ragged ass. No way.

01:03:45.604 --> 01:03:49.439
Anyway, I promised to get him
three pounds as a wedding gift.

01:03:49.441 --> 01:03:51.841
Wedding gift? What the
fuck? They getting married?

01:03:51.843 --> 01:03:52.810
Got your ass. You care!

01:03:52.812 --> 01:03:53.810
No, I don't care.

01:03:53.812 --> 01:03:55.178
Look at your caring ass, all concerned.

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.881
I wish them the best, I
mean, if that's what he want.

01:03:57.883 --> 01:03:59.049
Hey, you never know.

01:03:59.051 --> 01:04:00.484
You care. Well showing
how much we're growing

01:04:00.486 --> 01:04:01.884
so I said three pounds.

01:04:01.886 --> 01:04:04.254
Ain't like Reg can go upstairs and check.

01:04:04.256 --> 01:04:06.223
We ain't getting no ramp
up in this mothafucka

01:04:06.225 --> 01:04:08.928
so you go take more of
our weed, mothafucka.

01:04:09.461 --> 01:04:10.826
You a vulture, bro.

01:04:10.828 --> 01:04:13.229
I don't care, I mean I wish them the best.

01:04:15.367 --> 01:04:16.366
You smell something?

01:04:16.368 --> 01:04:18.301
Fire! Fire!

01:04:18.303 --> 01:04:19.505
Fire! Fire!

01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:22.404
Oh shit! Oh shit!

01:04:22.406 --> 01:04:24.774
Get something! Get something! All my weed!

01:04:26.544 --> 01:04:27.646
Hurry up!

01:04:29.414 --> 01:04:30.615
Oh fuck, man!

01:04:31.482 --> 01:04:32.716
Shit! Damn!

01:04:34.319 --> 01:04:37.490
Oh shit. Oh shit. You hear that?

01:04:39.124 --> 01:04:40.557
- That's the fire department.
- Damn, man!

01:04:40.559 --> 01:04:42.258
They gonna wanna come in and check around!

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.859
Just tell them we got
everything under control, man!

01:04:43.861 --> 01:04:45.863
I can't do that shit. They gotta
come in. They gotta check it.

01:04:45.865 --> 01:04:47.863
- It's they policy!
- Well that can't happen.

01:04:47.865 --> 01:04:49.098
Oh man, they gonna come in,

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:50.200
they gonna see what we've been doing.

01:04:50.202 --> 01:04:51.734
They gonna call the fucking police, man.

01:04:51.736 --> 01:04:53.102
Then you going to jail!

01:04:53.104 --> 01:04:55.040
I ain't going to jail,
I'm snitching on you.

01:04:57.243 --> 01:04:58.311
Damn!

01:05:02.682 --> 01:05:04.046
Is there a fire?

01:05:04.048 --> 01:05:06.515
Please tell me my BBC wolf is okay!

01:05:06.517 --> 01:05:08.486
Everything is good. Everything is good.

01:05:09.488 --> 01:05:10.287
Bring the hose.

01:05:10.289 --> 01:05:11.723
Hose? No, no! No need for a hose!

01:05:17.263 --> 01:05:18.164
Right there.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.234
Okay.

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:24.703
So how'd the trashcan catch fire?

01:05:27.071 --> 01:05:28.337
Is that the smell of a leafy substance

01:05:28.339 --> 01:05:30.540
resembling that of marijuana?

01:05:30.542 --> 01:05:33.877
You have a great nose.
And also amazing eyes.

01:05:33.879 --> 01:05:35.444
Well what happened was...

01:05:35.446 --> 01:05:38.515
we're legal. This is a marijuana card.

01:05:38.517 --> 01:05:40.515
Why I got this is because of uh...

01:05:40.517 --> 01:05:42.319
- A lack of appetite!
- Lack of appetite.

01:05:42.321 --> 01:05:43.886
And what happened was I was smoking

01:05:43.888 --> 01:05:45.654
and when I put my weed out

01:05:45.656 --> 01:05:48.758
I forgot to put it all the
way out. It started a fire.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.759
Well you can never be too sure
those things are fully out.

01:05:50.761 --> 01:05:54.497
Next time break it down into
smaller pieces before you roll it.

01:05:54.499 --> 01:05:55.665
- Will do.
- Mhmm.

01:05:57.903 --> 01:05:58.935
We're all good here.

01:05:58.937 --> 01:06:00.571
He smoke...

01:06:00.573 --> 01:06:01.774
He is dreamy.

01:06:04.443 --> 01:06:05.875
You're amazing!

01:06:05.877 --> 01:06:08.578
How did you think... You thought of this?

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.779
How did you do that, man?

01:06:09.781 --> 01:06:11.281
Double lucky blessings.

01:06:11.283 --> 01:06:13.515
Don't you start with that again, man.

01:06:13.517 --> 01:06:16.019
I don't care how you came
up with it. It's brilliant.

01:06:16.021 --> 01:06:17.687
Alright?

01:06:17.689 --> 01:06:18.620
- Now look.
- What's up?

01:06:18.622 --> 01:06:20.323
Matt said he gonna send
somebody here tomorrow

01:06:20.325 --> 01:06:22.258
to check out them damn filters.

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.361
I just hope the weed last overnight.

01:06:24.363 --> 01:06:25.796
Ah!

01:06:25.798 --> 01:06:31.401
Did you just say, "I hope
the weed lasts overnight"?

01:06:31.403 --> 01:06:33.035
Nah, your hearing aid's messing up.

01:06:33.037 --> 01:06:34.870
I said I hope we last overnight.

01:06:34.872 --> 01:06:36.740
- We last overnight.
- Us.

01:06:36.742 --> 01:06:41.377
Did you also say... that someone
was coming to fix the filters?

01:06:41.379 --> 01:06:43.011
- Heat filters.
- Heat filters.

01:06:43.013 --> 01:06:45.515
Oh no. Oh no.

01:06:45.517 --> 01:06:50.653
And all those lights that you
hauled off of the hydro truck.

01:06:50.655 --> 01:06:52.955
Maybe I think I should
just call Henry's people.

01:06:52.957 --> 01:06:54.357
And maybe I'm gonna call the cops

01:06:54.359 --> 01:06:56.627
and I'm just gonna tell them
that they should walk around...

01:06:56.629 --> 01:06:58.060
Oh come on, man!

01:06:58.062 --> 01:07:00.531
I am disappointed!

01:07:00.533 --> 01:07:03.536
- What?
- You would lie to me, BBC?

01:07:04.803 --> 01:07:06.102
Who's BBC?

01:07:06.104 --> 01:07:07.904
- That's me.
- BBC?

01:07:07.906 --> 01:07:09.138
A big black...

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:10.276
- ...chocolate.
- Chocolate.

01:07:11.176 --> 01:07:12.776
- Wolf.
- Wolf.

01:07:12.778 --> 01:07:13.877
Mmm!

01:07:13.879 --> 01:07:16.912
You know, I did not get to
be this old by being dumb.

01:07:16.914 --> 01:07:20.116
I think it is time we...

01:07:20.118 --> 01:07:21.216
cut the crap!

01:07:21.218 --> 01:07:23.620
And we just get down to business!

01:07:23.622 --> 01:07:25.154
- Business?
- Bid-ness!

01:07:25.156 --> 01:07:26.557
See, I tried to tell you.

01:07:26.559 --> 01:07:28.924
See I can act as if...

01:07:28.926 --> 01:07:31.060
I don't know anything's going on.

01:07:31.062 --> 01:07:32.731
I think you know where this is going.

01:07:33.265 --> 01:07:35.299
Oh, okay. I get it.

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:38.270
What is it going to take
for you not to know anything?

01:07:40.537 --> 01:07:41.706
You.

01:07:42.841 --> 01:07:44.073
- What?
- You.

01:07:44.075 --> 01:07:47.444
Wait, wait, listen. Listen
to me. Listen to me. Look up.

01:07:47.446 --> 01:07:49.479
We have a lot of money.
We have a lot of weed.

01:07:49.481 --> 01:07:51.247
I don't need your money.
I got a lot of money.

01:07:51.249 --> 01:07:53.649
And I don't smoke weed. I drink.

01:07:53.651 --> 01:07:54.718
I need a hit of that.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.752
Deal!

01:07:55.754 --> 01:07:56.785
Deal?

01:07:56.787 --> 01:07:57.787
We'll take it.

01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:59.388
- My house.
- Your house?

01:07:59.390 --> 01:08:00.823
We'll be at my house.

01:08:00.825 --> 01:08:02.058
Yeah, BBC. Go and handle that.

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:04.627
What the fuck? So I save your
ass and you give my ass away?

01:08:04.629 --> 01:08:06.395
- What type of shit...
- Handle that.

01:08:14.071 --> 01:08:16.740
<i>So I just set the
ventilation system back on.</i>

01:08:16.742 --> 01:08:18.008
You guys feel better now?

01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:19.341
Oh yeah. I feel much better.

01:08:19.343 --> 01:08:23.045
As a matter of fact, I'm a
little cold but I like it.

01:08:23.046 --> 01:08:24.249
How you feel, D?

01:08:24.747 --> 01:08:26.082
Like a rape victim.

01:08:26.084 --> 01:08:28.617
Like somebody took something from a nigga.

01:08:28.618 --> 01:08:30.719
You feel like a pimp now?
Do I owe you some money?

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.688
If I had to I would take
one for the team too.

01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:35.058
Nigga, I took one for the whole league!

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.492
Oh man. I'm so glad you guys made it.

01:08:37.493 --> 01:08:38.795
I thought you were goners.

01:08:38.796 --> 01:08:40.962
I got out just in time to
see your old lady pull up.

01:08:40.964 --> 01:08:43.366
Bro, you don't wanna know
what happened. Trust me.

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:44.734
He ain't gonna tell you.

01:08:44.736 --> 01:08:46.437
You guys, if I could give you a sitrep?

01:08:46.937 --> 01:08:48.071
Give us what?

01:08:48.073 --> 01:08:49.639
A sitrep. A situation report.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.139
You know. A status of operation.

01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:54.876
Aw shit. Don't you come with this
conspiracy shit like this nigga.

01:08:54.877 --> 01:08:56.246
What do you mean?

01:08:56.247 --> 01:08:58.514
The bad news is that you guys
did lose the one room to the fire.

01:08:58.515 --> 01:09:00.617
But the good news is that I
checked up on all the other

01:09:00.618 --> 01:09:02.585
six rooms and they're
all according to plan.

01:09:02.587 --> 01:09:05.520
Yeah well now we just need to
clip some of these big water leaves

01:09:05.522 --> 01:09:06.790
'cause they're blocking direct light.

01:09:06.792 --> 01:09:08.959
Well let's go ahead and
get started on this room.

01:09:08.961 --> 01:09:11.027
Get all those old plants out there

01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:12.895
and paint the room up again.

01:09:12.897 --> 01:09:14.363
Let's do it.

01:10:36.347 --> 01:10:37.380
What up, man?

01:10:37.382 --> 01:10:38.381
We got a leak.

01:10:38.383 --> 01:10:39.381

01:10:39.383 --> 01:10:40.550

01:10:40.552 --> 01:10:41.620
Oh shit!

01:10:43.288 --> 01:10:44.787
I gotta take a leak.

01:10:48.293 --> 01:10:49.828
Shit.

01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:52.562
That's not gonna get the job done.

01:10:52.564 --> 01:10:54.066
Every little bit counts!

01:10:57.435 --> 01:10:59.169
What the hell is you doing?

01:10:59.171 --> 01:11:00.903
You said every little bit counts.

01:11:00.905 --> 01:11:01.774
Oh damn!

01:11:02.873 --> 01:11:05.711
Sorry, I left the damn
water timer on manual.

01:11:08.279 --> 01:11:09.414
What's that smell?

01:11:10.815 --> 01:11:11.949
Smells like chemicals.

01:11:16.788 --> 01:11:17.920
Smells like chemicals.

01:11:17.922 --> 01:11:20.090
Just smells like weed and spray to me.

01:11:20.092 --> 01:11:21.124
Spray?

01:11:21.126 --> 01:11:22.893
There was some flies all on the weed

01:11:22.895 --> 01:11:25.060
so I went on ahead and
sprayed the bug spray on it.

01:11:25.062 --> 01:11:27.464
What kind of bug spray?

01:11:27.466 --> 01:11:30.066
The bug spray I saw in
the garage. The Bugged Out.

01:11:30.068 --> 01:11:34.103
You sprayed... You sprayed
all of this with Bug Out?

01:11:34.105 --> 01:11:36.104
No. Just this room.

01:11:36.106 --> 01:11:37.340
Thank God.

01:11:37.342 --> 01:11:38.441
Why, what's wrong?

01:11:38.443 --> 01:11:40.376
All of the plants in this room are ruined.

01:11:40.378 --> 01:11:41.478
Really?

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.246
- What? Wait.
- Yeah, really.

01:11:43.248 --> 01:11:45.281
All these plants we have
to throw in the trash.

01:11:45.283 --> 01:11:47.450
Why would you do that?

01:11:47.452 --> 01:11:48.850
I was just trying to help!

01:11:48.852 --> 01:11:50.653
And why the hell would
you listen to me anyway?

01:11:50.655 --> 01:11:52.688
I ain't got no high school education.

01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:53.625
Darius!

01:11:54.292 --> 01:11:55.392
Okay.

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:56.526
He doesn't have a high school education?

01:11:56.528 --> 01:11:58.060
No he don't. He don't have...

01:11:58.062 --> 01:12:00.929
That's sad. But this
is fucked. We're fucked.

01:12:00.931 --> 01:12:04.700
What, you can't fix it? So
all this goes in the trash?

01:12:04.702 --> 01:12:07.135
<i>That's it. We're in
the harvest phase now.</i>

01:12:07.137 --> 01:12:09.839
<i>Boys, we got one week left
until the finish line.</i>

01:12:09.841 --> 01:12:13.710
Oh that's crazy. I didn't realize
till just now what day that was.

01:12:13.712 --> 01:12:15.245
- The 20th.
- It's the 20th.

01:12:15.247 --> 01:12:16.644
Yeah.

01:12:16.646 --> 01:12:19.415
Like... it's trippy, right?

01:12:19.417 --> 01:12:20.950
What's trippy? It's the 20th. What?

01:12:20.952 --> 01:12:23.122
It's 4-20. That's like the weed holiday.

01:12:23.888 --> 01:12:24.920
Yeah.

01:12:24.922 --> 01:12:26.057
Well fire it up then!

01:12:27.559 --> 01:12:29.660
Yeah let's fire it up. I'm out.

01:12:31.395 --> 01:12:32.961
I'm out.

01:12:32.963 --> 01:12:35.167
So we got a grow room with no weed?

01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:42.170
That's like having a strip club...

01:12:42.172 --> 01:12:43.541
with no strippers.

01:12:51.949 --> 01:12:52.982
Are you okay?

01:12:52.984 --> 01:12:54.553
Give me a second. Give me a second.

01:13:04.695 --> 01:13:07.295
Ain't no Bugged Out ever hurt nobody.

01:13:07.297 --> 01:13:08.798
Shit.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.232
Ain't about to waste all this good weed

01:13:10.234 --> 01:13:11.800
that I raised from babies.

01:13:11.802 --> 01:13:13.805
The hell they think I am? A deadbeat dad?

01:13:14.705 --> 01:13:16.074
I'm there for my kids.

01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:26.717
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey!

01:13:27.351 --> 01:13:28.317
Gimme the scissors.

01:13:28.319 --> 01:13:30.219
Damn!

01:13:30.221 --> 01:13:32.287
Why we can't just snatch 'em up right now?

01:13:32.289 --> 01:13:35.390
'Cause that's like pedophilia,
man. These are babies.

01:13:35.392 --> 01:13:37.593
That's like touching little babies.

01:13:37.595 --> 01:13:39.127
I wouldn't go that damn far.

01:13:39.129 --> 01:13:40.462
That's what it is, man.

01:13:40.464 --> 01:13:42.764
Come on.

01:13:42.766 --> 01:13:45.401
Alright, maybe we can take
one off of like the tippy top

01:13:45.403 --> 01:13:46.768
'cause they matured a little bit more.

01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:49.237
Yes! Lord, forgive us
for touching the babies.

01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:53.945
- What was that?
- God?

01:13:56.114 --> 01:13:58.380
That wasn't God. That
was coming from outside.

Oh my god. Mrs. Gilliam.

01:15:29.807 --> 01:15:31.374
We trying to change some
things in the community.

01:15:31.376 --> 01:15:33.876
It's kinda dead around here
and I figure we liven it up.

01:15:33.878 --> 01:15:35.879
As much as I appreciate
the free entertainment,

01:15:35.881 --> 01:15:37.514
it's amazing, I'm really proud of you guys,

01:15:37.516 --> 01:15:39.615
but the property value
is going down as we speak.

01:15:39.617 --> 01:15:42.050
So, could you guys just
keep it down a little bit?

01:15:42.052 --> 01:15:44.088
I really would appreciate that. Thank you.

01:15:45.422 --> 01:15:48.389

the hell I get out there

01:15:54.998 --> 01:15:56.832
in the middle of the driveway like that.

01:15:56.834 --> 01:15:58.634

with this Shake Weight?

01:15:58.636 --> 01:16:00.035

01:16:03.374 --> 01:16:05.742
Look, do not encourage his ass.

01:16:05.744 --> 01:16:07.343
I think I can get into it.

01:16:07.345 --> 01:16:08.911
You felt it? Was it that good?

01:16:08.913 --> 01:16:11.947
What you was doing with the Shake
Weight is bugging the fuck out.

01:16:11.949 --> 01:16:13.983
You jeopardized this whole grow, man.

01:16:13.985 --> 01:16:17.553
Do not bring unwanted
attention to your grow house.

01:16:17.555 --> 01:16:18.955
And that shit was unwanted.

01:16:18.957 --> 01:16:20.456
You're right. I'm sorry. My fault.

01:16:20.458 --> 01:16:23.524
I mean, first things first. We
have to finish this harvest, guys.

01:16:23.526 --> 01:16:26.395
Then we can give everybody
they cut. Can't wait to do that.

01:16:26.397 --> 01:16:29.032
Hey look at the bright side. At
least we had a successful grow.

01:16:29.034 --> 01:16:29.965
No.

01:16:29.967 --> 01:16:31.901
Sort of. If you wanna call it that.

01:16:31.903 --> 01:16:33.736
Hey, why Snoop ain't called me yet?

01:16:33.738 --> 01:16:35.705
Guys, we still have stuff
left to do here, so...

01:16:35.707 --> 01:16:39.442
Speaking of Snoop... hit
him up, and hit your girl...

01:16:39.444 --> 01:16:40.977
- ...ex-girl...
- Right.

01:16:40.979 --> 01:16:44.279
and let 'em know everything be
ready for the payout on the 20th.

01:16:44.281 --> 01:16:46.549
This damn house will be done by then too.

01:17:16.114 --> 01:17:18.647
Hey, what time is everybody
supposed to show up?

01:17:18.649 --> 01:17:20.183
Well I told everybody around 4:00.

01:17:20.185 --> 01:17:23.286
That way they have they weed around 4:20.

01:17:23.288 --> 01:17:24.553
Oh that's trippy. I like it.

01:17:24.555 --> 01:17:27.055
It's a good idea we didn't
dry that weed all the way.

01:17:27.057 --> 01:17:29.591
The more it weigh, the less we pay.

01:17:29.593 --> 01:17:31.393
Think about all the weed we lost, man.

01:17:31.395 --> 01:17:32.627
The fire.

01:17:32.629 --> 01:17:33.962
The mold.

01:17:33.964 --> 01:17:35.163
The flood!

01:17:35.165 --> 01:17:36.198
The Bugged Out.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.001
Most of all, all the
unexpected partners we acquired.

01:17:39.003 --> 01:17:40.502
Matter of fact I had
to pay Mrs. Gilliam off.

01:17:40.504 --> 01:17:42.371
That should account for everything.

01:17:42.373 --> 01:17:45.376
She's kinda sexy for
her age. Is she flexible?

01:17:46.144 --> 01:17:47.143
Depends.

01:17:47.145 --> 01:17:48.577
Depends on what?

01:17:48.579 --> 01:17:50.813
No it depends on if she's wearing
Depends 'cause when she ain't...

01:17:50.815 --> 01:17:52.081
- What does that have...
- Listen!

01:17:52.083 --> 01:17:54.383
Whatever happened, happened, man.

01:17:54.385 --> 01:17:56.751
We lose, we lose. Ain't
no going back on it, man.

01:17:56.753 --> 01:17:58.786
I don't know about that.

01:17:58.788 --> 01:18:00.122
Why don't we try to call Snoop back up?

01:18:00.124 --> 01:18:01.558
Try to re-un-negotiate
the deal?

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:02.959
Re-un-negotiate?

01:18:02.961 --> 01:18:04.993
You know what, he was cool as
hell about this whole thing.

01:18:04.995 --> 01:18:06.629
He ain't called us one time. Give it a try!

01:18:06.631 --> 01:18:07.929
Yeah, let me hit him up.

01:18:07.931 --> 01:18:09.432
You know, what he gonna say?

01:18:09.434 --> 01:18:10.666
Tell him we took a...

01:18:10.668 --> 01:18:12.738
Hello? Oh, it's voicemail.

01:18:13.538 --> 01:18:14.703
<i>...paper right now.</i>

01:18:14.705 --> 01:18:17.840
<i>But if this is about my
paper, leave me a message</i>

01:18:17.842 --> 01:18:19.242
<i>and I'll get back at you.</i>

01:18:19.244 --> 01:18:21.577
Yeah, um... Let's just
talk to him man-to-man.

01:18:21.579 --> 01:18:24.147
What about Matt's piece?
I mean, we gotta get paid.

01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:26.215
Come on, man!

01:18:26.217 --> 01:18:28.184
Of course we gonna take care of you, bro.

01:18:28.186 --> 01:18:30.385
You're a real nigga. I
fucked with you my nigga.

01:18:30.387 --> 01:18:32.822
I don't know what that means but
I really enjoyed this experience.

01:18:32.824 --> 01:18:34.424
It was good working with you people.

01:18:34.426 --> 01:18:37.426
You people? The fuck you
mean by "You people," bro?

01:18:37.428 --> 01:18:38.426
Huh?

01:18:38.428 --> 01:18:40.529
I just meant like you
people, like my people.

01:18:40.531 --> 01:18:41.831
You're my people... not my people.

01:18:41.833 --> 01:18:43.499
What the fuck you mean
by "Your people," man?

01:18:43.501 --> 01:18:44.733
I don't mean like I own...

01:18:44.735 --> 01:18:46.102
What the fuck you mean "You own"?

01:18:46.104 --> 01:18:47.502
No I just meant we're all people.

01:18:47.504 --> 01:18:49.072
What you mean, man? Huh?

01:18:49.074 --> 01:18:52.274
I really don't care. I'm mixed.
I'm gonna get the doorbell.

01:18:52.276 --> 01:18:53.408
I'm not mixed, bro.

01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:54.809
I didn't mean anything.

01:18:54.811 --> 01:18:56.612
What you mean about
you ain't mean anything?

01:18:56.614 --> 01:18:57.880
That's exactly what it sounds like.

01:18:57.882 --> 01:18:59.384
What the fuck you mean "exactly" though?

01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:01.383
I'm sorry.

01:19:01.385 --> 01:19:02.917
What the fuck you mean by you sorry, bro?

01:19:02.919 --> 01:19:04.489
It means I apologize.

01:19:05.388 --> 01:19:06.490
I'll get the weed.

01:19:09.726 --> 01:19:10.725
Here it is.

01:19:10.727 --> 01:19:12.527
Thank you, brotha.

01:19:12.529 --> 01:19:16.933
A'ight. Everybody gonna get they
share as soon as Snoop gets here.

01:19:16.935 --> 01:19:18.968
Yeah, that's the plan, we sticking to it.

01:19:18.970 --> 01:19:21.603
Listen, if you really think
Snoop is about to come here

01:19:21.605 --> 01:19:23.406
to pick up some weed, you'sa lame.

01:19:25.376 --> 01:19:27.410
- What's that?
- I'll get the door.

01:19:27.412 --> 01:19:28.810
Wonder who that could be.

01:19:28.812 --> 01:19:30.882
See? Shut the fuck up, boo.

01:19:31.815 --> 01:19:33.916
Well happy 4-20 everybody.

01:19:33.918 --> 01:19:34.850
What's up, Snoop.

01:19:34.852 --> 01:19:35.818
Hey, what's up, Nephew.

01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.786
- Snoop!
- Grown Gangsta.

01:19:37.788 --> 01:19:38.720
Hi, Snoop.

01:19:38.722 --> 01:19:39.824
Well hello, sunshine.

01:19:41.758 --> 01:19:43.091
- Snoop?
- Mhmm?

01:19:43.093 --> 01:19:45.127
Can me and Darius holla at
you in the kitchen right quick?

01:19:45.129 --> 01:19:47.833
Oh man, whatever you like,
man. Show me where to get there.

01:19:50.802 --> 01:19:52.270
"Hi, Snoop."

01:19:52.837 --> 01:19:54.737
What?

01:19:54.739 --> 01:19:56.671
Snoop's supposed to walk in, I'm supposed
to act like I don't know who Snoop is?

01:19:56.673 --> 01:19:59.207
Bitch, this ain't Walmart.
He don't need no greeter.

01:19:59.209 --> 01:20:00.477
Want something to drink, man?

01:20:01.279 --> 01:20:02.612
Turkey sandwich?

01:20:02.614 --> 01:20:04.413
You said we had some tuna... We
have some tuna left. Want some tuna?

01:20:04.415 --> 01:20:06.450
No, no, no. I just want
my shit. Where my weed at?

01:20:07.517 --> 01:20:08.917
Oh.

01:20:08.919 --> 01:20:11.355
So we getting right
down to it. Um, Snoop...

01:20:12.656 --> 01:20:14.357
...we agreed on half, right?

01:20:14.359 --> 01:20:16.125
Yeah. That's what I'm
leaving with. Half, right?

01:20:16.127 --> 01:20:17.160
<i>Okay but that's Snoop Dogg.</i>

01:20:17.162 --> 01:20:19.394
I'm just supposed to say nothing?

01:20:19.396 --> 01:20:20.962
You supposed to play your position.

01:20:20.964 --> 01:20:22.665
Why are you always tripping?

01:20:22.667 --> 01:20:24.633
Bitch, I can't trip.

01:20:24.635 --> 01:20:27.703
I know we agreed on half, but things
ain't go how we thought they'd go.

01:20:27.705 --> 01:20:33.408
We was talking 'bout half and third,
I'm thinkin' more like the third, y'know.

01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:35.010
Grown Gangsta.

01:20:35.012 --> 01:20:37.278
I'm mothafuckin'
disappointed with you, nigga.

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:41.283
Nah, nah. What he said he was just
thinking about the third, Snoop.

01:20:41.285 --> 01:20:42.917
Y'know, man. But he
gonna keep it one hundred.

01:20:42.919 --> 01:20:46.089
'Cause Grown Gangsta say you always
keep it one hundred with him, man.

01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:47.523
- Day one.
- We really just wanted

01:20:47.525 --> 01:20:48.691
to show you the kitchen, man.

01:20:48.693 --> 01:20:51.426
Yeah, you ain't even know
this was a refrigerator.

01:20:51.428 --> 01:20:53.295
See? We got you.

01:20:53.297 --> 01:20:55.065
Okay well then get back to the living room.

01:20:57.534 --> 01:20:59.604
Alright, Chris. Let's break it up.

01:21:01.439 --> 01:21:03.475
Snoop, the take was twenty pounds.

01:21:04.607 --> 01:21:05.706
That entitles you to ten, bro.

01:21:05.708 --> 01:21:07.210
Oh man.

01:21:07.212 --> 01:21:10.011
It is so beautiful doing
business with y'all, man.

01:21:10.013 --> 01:21:11.613
It's a treat when playas meet.

01:21:11.615 --> 01:21:14.849
Grown Gangsta, that
mix-tape, I'm fuckin' with you

01:21:14.851 --> 01:21:16.385
but you better thank this nigga Pat, man.

01:21:16.387 --> 01:21:19.057
He really got your back,
man. He give a fuck about you.

01:21:19.757 --> 01:21:20.822
Yeah.

01:21:20.824 --> 01:21:22.224
I'm outta here. Let's roll.

01:21:22.226 --> 01:21:23.992
- Bye Snoop!
- Alright baby.

01:21:23.994 --> 01:21:25.928
Chris.

01:21:25.930 --> 01:21:27.395
Seven pounds over there for you, brother.

01:21:27.397 --> 01:21:28.930
- Oh, for real?
- Wait, nuh-uh.

01:21:28.932 --> 01:21:31.032
For real nothing. Seven pounds from where?

01:21:31.034 --> 01:21:31.934
Yeah wait. Hold up.

01:21:31.936 --> 01:21:33.669
How'd you come up with that?

01:21:33.671 --> 01:21:35.170
That ain't adding up, homeboy.

01:21:35.172 --> 01:21:40.443
Okay, all the equipment, the setup, him
dealing with the grow house day to day,

01:21:40.445 --> 01:21:43.014
that's seven pounds right there, homie.

01:21:45.216 --> 01:21:46.816
- Appreciate you.
- It's been fun, man.

01:21:46.818 --> 01:21:49.320
If we do this again maybe you guys
will end up with something, y'know?

01:21:50.521 --> 01:21:51.422
Ha!

01:21:52.824 --> 01:21:55.325
So... what about ours?

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:56.759
Terri and Reg.

01:21:56.761 --> 01:21:58.129
Mhmm.

01:21:58.829 --> 01:21:59.995
Three pounds.

01:21:59.997 --> 01:22:01.464
Not a seed more.

01:22:01.466 --> 01:22:03.799
I hope you got your shit outta here

01:22:03.801 --> 01:22:06.234
because I'm about to lock
it up. Give me the keys.

01:22:06.236 --> 01:22:08.002
Listen, while you working on the house,

01:22:08.004 --> 01:22:10.005
go on ahead and throw
in some ratchet locks.

01:22:10.007 --> 01:22:11.340
And work on your feet.

01:22:11.342 --> 01:22:13.776
And his toenails. Then on his fingers.

01:22:13.778 --> 01:22:15.213
Goodbye.

01:22:18.449 --> 01:22:19.417
Damn.

01:22:22.419 --> 01:22:24.420
Whoo!

01:22:24.422 --> 01:22:26.287
Damn.

01:22:26.289 --> 01:22:28.693
I feel like LeBron right
before he won the big one, man.

01:22:29.727 --> 01:22:31.096
We was so close!

01:22:34.466 --> 01:22:35.764
Look at this.

01:22:35.766 --> 01:22:37.300
Says right here,

01:22:37.302 --> 01:22:40.538
"In the end, the happiest day
of your grow is after step ten."

01:22:41.739 --> 01:22:42.673
Do I look happy?

01:22:44.609 --> 01:22:46.410
What the hell is you smiling 'bout?

01:22:47.378 --> 01:22:48.710
All that shit we been through

01:22:48.712 --> 01:22:50.647
and all you got to show for
it is that one damn blunt.

01:22:51.882 --> 01:22:53.648
Not exactly.

01:22:53.650 --> 01:22:54.617
What?

01:22:54.619 --> 01:22:57.318
We still got two pounds
we didn't know we had.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.621
How's that? We weighed it all out.

01:22:59.623 --> 01:23:02.023
We still had that Bugged Out in the garage.

01:23:02.025 --> 01:23:03.058
I ain't smokin' that.

01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.294
I ain't either.

01:23:04.928 --> 01:23:06.027
Huh?

01:23:06.029 --> 01:23:07.362
Oh! You switched...

01:23:07.364 --> 01:23:08.798
You happy now, ain't you?

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:09.798
Hell yeah I'm happy!

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:10.765
I know you is.

01:23:10.767 --> 01:23:12.134
You a smart mothafucka, man!

01:23:12.136 --> 01:23:14.036
Hey, man, I learned from the best, bro.

01:23:14.038 --> 01:23:15.336
We learned from each other, bro.

01:23:15.338 --> 01:23:17.005
- My man.
- Let me hit that. Let me hit that.

01:23:17.007 --> 01:23:18.206
- Nope.
- Let me hit that.

01:23:18.208 --> 01:23:21.410
Wow, you guys look happy.

01:23:21.412 --> 01:23:24.115
Actually it's our last day
disturbing your neighborhood.

01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:26.684
We moving out.

01:23:27.952 --> 01:23:30.254
Mhmm. So the crop must be done.

01:23:32.323 --> 01:23:34.822
Don't think that because I
don't get out the house much

01:23:34.824 --> 01:23:37.361
that I don't know what you
guys have going on over here.
