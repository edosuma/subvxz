WEBVTT

00:03.352 --> 00:05.386
What a wonderful day, thank you.

00:05.387 --> 00:06.820
Oh, we're glad
you had fun.

00:06.822 --> 00:09.322
Blue Icees and a trip
to The Container Store?

00:09.324 --> 00:11.958
It's like I died and went
to the post-mortem,

00:11.960 --> 00:16.363
neuron-induced hallucination
commonly mistaken as heaven.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.465
I still don't understand
why you bought that pill caddie.

00:18.467 --> 00:19.633
You're a young man.

00:19.635 --> 00:22.035
Age is a state of
mind, Leonard.

00:22.037 --> 00:24.104
In here I'm 90.

00:26.575 --> 00:29.509
Why are you taking
your bins over there?

00:29.511 --> 00:31.011
That's just where
I need them.

00:31.013 --> 00:33.013
You know, she doesn't have
a lot of closet space.

00:33.015 --> 00:35.048
What's wrong with your closet?

00:35.050 --> 00:36.583
Uh...

00:36.585 --> 00:38.318
Well, honey, you know,

00:38.320 --> 00:39.886
now that Leonard and I
are married,

00:39.888 --> 00:42.823
it kind of makes sense
that we actually live together.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.591
So that's all this day was?

00:44.593 --> 00:47.427
A plan to butter me up
before delivering bad news?

00:47.429 --> 00:49.429
Come on, buddy.
No, I thought we were friends.

00:49.431 --> 00:51.698
You asked for a sip of my Icee.

00:51.700 --> 00:54.768
If you had your own straw,
I might've said yes.

00:54.770 --> 00:58.338
Sheldon, please, we already
feel bad about this.

00:58.340 --> 01:00.307
You know what they don't sell
at The Container Store?

01:00.309 --> 01:02.909
Something large enough
to contain my disappointment.

01:04.813 --> 01:06.012
Although,

01:06.014 --> 01:08.982
if anyone did, it would be them.

01:38.308 --> 01:40.842
Thank you for letting
me come speak with you.

01:40.844 --> 01:42.477
Of course.

01:42.479 --> 01:44.613
As my relationships
with Penny and Amy

01:44.615 --> 01:46.681
are currently strained,
I'm turning to you

01:46.683 --> 01:48.583
for female comfort
and encouragement.

01:48.585 --> 01:50.118
Aww.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.053
I'm honored.
I tried

01:52.055 --> 01:54.322
reaching out to my mother,
but she was in Bible study.

01:54.324 --> 01:56.191
Leonard's mother
is on a book tour.

01:56.193 --> 01:57.659
My Mee-Maw was taking a nap,

01:57.661 --> 02:00.629
and after a while Siri
started repeating her answers.

02:01.465 --> 02:04.132
So, I'm your seventh choice.

02:04.134 --> 02:07.369
Yeah, I know, top ten,
pretty exciting.

02:07.371 --> 02:09.905
How can I help you?

02:09.907 --> 02:11.806
Well, in addition
to Amy leaving me,

02:11.808 --> 02:13.909
Leonard's moving in with Penny.

02:13.911 --> 02:16.912
It's difficult
not to feel abandoned.

02:16.914 --> 02:20.181
Well, why don't you look at this
as an opportunity?

02:20.183 --> 02:22.417
You had other roommates
before Leonard.

02:22.419 --> 02:23.718
Maybe this is a chance

02:23.720 --> 02:25.120
to find someone new.

02:25.122 --> 02:27.622
Perhaps I could find someone
better than Leonard.

02:27.624 --> 02:30.292
Someone I can rub in his face.

02:30.294 --> 02:32.827
Chris Pratt's
all the rage right now.

02:33.730 --> 02:34.729
I wonder how he'd feel

02:34.731 --> 02:37.232
about taking
the smaller bedroom.

02:37.234 --> 02:39.167
Hey.
Hey.

02:39.169 --> 02:42.404
You know who would be
the perfect roommate?

02:43.774 --> 02:46.741
Gandalf, but he's a smoker.

02:46.743 --> 02:48.777
Stuart.

02:48.779 --> 02:50.345
He's been living with us
for a while now.

02:50.347 --> 02:52.247
I'm sure he'd love
to get us out of his hair.

02:52.249 --> 02:54.716
Nope, couldn't be happier.

02:54.718 --> 02:56.351
Well, Sheldon's looking
for a...

02:56.353 --> 02:59.454
Nope.

02:59.456 --> 03:01.690
He'll think about it.
No I won't!

03:04.061 --> 03:05.694
Have you seen
this Archie comic?

03:05.696 --> 03:08.730
It's actually
<i>Archie versus Predator.</i>

03:08.732 --> 03:11.266
How could Archie
defeat Predator?

03:11.268 --> 03:12.500
I don't know.

03:12.502 --> 03:14.903
Maybe Jughead's a Terminator.

03:16.073 --> 03:19.140
Hey.
Hey, Stuart.

03:19.142 --> 03:21.009
Do you guys know any musicians?

03:21.011 --> 03:21.977
Why?

03:21.979 --> 03:23.345
I was thinking it might be cool

03:23.347 --> 03:25.880
to have live music here
a few nights a week.

03:25.882 --> 03:27.315
You know, give
this place more

03:27.317 --> 03:29.384
of a "staying in business" vibe.

03:29.386 --> 03:32.721
What kind of music
are you thinking of?

03:32.723 --> 03:37.125
I like all kinds of music,
but my favorite genre is free.

03:37.995 --> 03:39.060
Hey, we've always talked

03:39.062 --> 03:40.161
about playing together.

03:40.163 --> 03:41.463
Well, it could be fun

03:41.465 --> 03:42.564
to try a little acoustic thing.

03:42.566 --> 03:44.532
Oh, we could play
"filk" music.

03:44.534 --> 03:46.134
What's that?

03:46.136 --> 03:47.602
It's been around for years.

03:47.604 --> 03:51.339
It's like folk music,
but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.

03:51.341 --> 03:52.540
I like it.

03:52.542 --> 03:53.742
It sounds exactly like something

03:53.744 --> 03:56.144
I shouldn't be expected
to pay for.

03:56.146 --> 03:58.113
Dude, if we do this,

03:58.115 --> 03:59.948
we're gonna need
a cool band name.

03:59.950 --> 04:01.750
You know, I've actually
(chuckles)

04:01.752 --> 04:04.352
had one I've been
sitting on for years.

04:04.354 --> 04:05.520
Really?

04:05.522 --> 04:06.888
It was for this power trio

04:06.890 --> 04:08.690
I tried to put together
in junior high,

04:08.692 --> 04:11.259
but I was short two friends.

04:11.261 --> 04:12.861
What is it?

04:12.863 --> 04:15.664
Footprints on the Moon.

04:17.534 --> 04:20.802
I just got chills.

04:20.803 --> 04:22.470
So did I.

04:22.472 --> 04:24.005
Me, too.

04:24.007 --> 04:27.208
But I-I might have Lyme Disease.

04:29.546 --> 04:31.913
Just a few more signatures,
and we'll be finished.

04:31.915 --> 04:35.350
Initial here to acknowledge
that you've returned your key.

04:38.488 --> 04:40.321
Okay.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.357
As my future neighbor,

04:42.359 --> 04:45.193
I'd like you to have a key.

04:47.130 --> 04:51.566
Initial here to acknowledge
you received it.

04:51.568 --> 04:54.002
I'm proud of you.
You're taking this really well.

04:54.004 --> 04:55.843
Well, it's not like I'm never
going to see you two again.

04:55.867 --> 04:58.995
Which brings us to
article 23 subsection C--

04:59.290 --> 05:01.523
please check here
to reserve your spot

05:01.525 --> 05:04.208
at the ten year
roommate reunion.

05:05.158 --> 05:06.770
Do I really have to do that now?

05:07.272 --> 05:08.605
No, but if you want chicken

05:08.607 --> 05:11.040
and get stuck with the fish,year
that's on you.

05:12.244 --> 05:13.643
All right.

05:13.645 --> 05:15.478
Oh, and lastly,

05:15.480 --> 05:17.313
please initial here to confirm

05:17.315 --> 05:18.815
that ownership
of the living room couch

05:18.817 --> 05:20.016
is hereby transferred to me

05:20.018 --> 05:22.018
in perpetuity
all throughout the universe

05:22.020 --> 05:23.887
and all alternate universes

05:23.889 --> 05:25.989
except for those universes
where owning a couch

05:25.991 --> 05:27.624
is forbidden by the hive queen.

05:27.626 --> 05:29.793
In which case,
all glory to the hive queen.

05:32.697 --> 05:34.397
All right,
now all that's left

05:34.399 --> 05:37.100
is for us to sign
and date the document,

05:37.102 --> 05:40.503
and we will officially
no longer be roommates.

05:44.242 --> 05:45.542
What's the matter?

05:45.544 --> 05:47.677
It's harder than I thought.

05:47.679 --> 05:49.145
Let me help you.

05:49.147 --> 05:50.146
L-E-O-N...

05:50.148 --> 05:52.582
That helped.

05:53.718 --> 05:56.352
So I have an idea
for a filk song.

05:56.354 --> 05:57.921
Kind of a,

05:57.923 --> 06:00.757
a power ballad,
superhero crossover tale

06:00.759 --> 06:02.959
of epic proportions.

06:02.961 --> 06:04.928
Is it cold in here,

06:04.930 --> 06:07.630
'cause, oh, my.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.635
Okay, so it's a, it's a
David and Goliath story.

06:12.637 --> 06:14.804
It's about man against God.

06:14.806 --> 06:17.640
It's called "Hammer and Whip:

06:17.642 --> 06:18.875
"The Untold Story

06:18.877 --> 06:22.679
of Thor versus Indiana Jones."

06:24.482 --> 06:26.816
Thor versus Indiana Jones?

06:26.818 --> 06:29.752
You just blew my filking mind.

06:29.754 --> 06:32.388
Okay, I don't have it
all worked out yet,

06:32.390 --> 06:35.091
but I was thinking
something like, um...

06:35.093 --> 06:37.360
♪ Oh, Indy ♪

06:37.362 --> 06:39.662

Mamma-jamma just came to me.

07:20.138 --> 07:21.571
Okay, and here's the hook.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.154
Hey, remember
<i>The Ark of the Covenant?</i>

07:50.155 --> 07:50.844
Yeah?

07:50.868 --> 07:53.019
That's how much we're
gonna melt people's faces off.

07:56.441 --> 07:59.275
I appreciate your interest
in the apartment.

07:59.277 --> 08:01.678
I just need to ask you
a few standard questions.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.313
Sure.
It says here you're a chemist.

08:03.315 --> 08:06.616
Which element
on the periodic table

08:06.618 --> 08:10.453
do you feel is too big
for its britches?

08:11.756 --> 08:13.790
Is that supposed to be a joke?

08:13.792 --> 08:16.392
Looks like argon's not
the only one

08:16.394 --> 08:19.062
with an attitude problem.

08:19.064 --> 08:20.563
In general,

08:20.565 --> 08:23.099
would you say
that you smell better, worse

08:23.101 --> 08:26.836
or the same as you do right now?

08:28.340 --> 08:29.672
I was going to ask you

08:29.674 --> 08:31.407
what is the best fruit,

08:31.409 --> 08:33.241
but then I realized
what I want to ask you

08:33.244 --> 08:35.678
is why is there a Band-Aid
on your forearm,

08:35.679 --> 08:36.611
but then I realized what

08:36.614 --> 08:37.981
I really want to ask you is

08:37.982 --> 08:39.982
just can you just go?

08:41.519 --> 08:43.251
You're healthy.

08:43.254 --> 08:45.054
You have a job in the sciences.

08:45.056 --> 08:47.623
I've got to say, if this
credit report comes back good,

08:47.625 --> 08:49.158
you're the frontrunner.

08:53.832 --> 08:55.698
I'm not gonna be
your roommate, Sheldon.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.334
But I met with 11 people,

08:58.336 --> 08:59.802
and they all walked out.

08:59.804 --> 09:01.537
And that Hollywood phony
Chris Pratt

09:01.539 --> 09:03.406
never tweeted me back.

09:03.408 --> 09:06.175
I'm sure you'll find
somebody else.

09:06.177 --> 09:08.011
I suppose.

09:08.013 --> 09:09.412
What happened to me, Amy?

09:09.414 --> 09:10.546
Years ago I was

09:10.548 --> 09:12.882
completely disengaged
from my feelings.

09:12.884 --> 09:14.450
I'd say it was a happier time,

09:14.452 --> 09:18.421
but I was disengaged from
my feelings, so who can tell?

09:18.423 --> 09:20.757
I don't know how to help you.

09:20.759 --> 09:23.059
You know,
feelings are a part of life.

09:23.061 --> 09:24.694
They didn't used to be.

09:24.696 --> 09:26.396
You and Leonard and Penny,

09:26.398 --> 09:28.498
you all poisoned me
with emotions.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.633
I was like the Tin Man,
perfectly content

09:30.635 --> 09:32.969
until that evil Wizard
gave him a heart.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.241
I don't think that was
the point of the movie.

09:38.243 --> 09:39.709
Fine, then I was like Pinocchio

09:39.711 --> 09:43.312
before that jerk Geppetto
went and made him a real boy.

09:43.314 --> 09:45.515
There you go.

09:47.719 --> 09:49.385
So, what are you
thinking for dinner?

09:49.387 --> 09:50.486
Well, it's Thai food night.

09:50.488 --> 09:51.587
Well, honey,

09:51.589 --> 09:52.922
you don't live
with Sheldon anymore.

09:52.924 --> 09:54.524
You can have anything you want.

09:54.526 --> 09:56.859
You're right.

09:56.861 --> 09:58.227
But what?

09:59.197 --> 10:00.263
Mexican?

10:00.265 --> 10:01.664
Italian? German?

10:01.666 --> 10:02.999
Indian? Greek?

10:03.001 --> 10:04.233
Cuban? Chinese?

10:04.235 --> 10:05.234
Pizza? Barbecue?

10:05.236 --> 10:08.204
Korean? Korean barbecue?

10:09.007 --> 10:10.173
How about Thai food?

10:10.175 --> 10:12.041
Oh, thank God

10:15.046 --> 10:17.280
Hey, we're going to dinner.
You want to come?

10:17.282 --> 10:18.948
Oh, I wish I could,

10:18.950 --> 10:22.151
but I realized I've become
too emotionally vulnerable,

10:22.153 --> 10:24.153
so, like an operating system,

10:24.155 --> 10:27.256
I'm restoring my life
to the last stable version,

10:27.258 --> 10:30.593
which was in 2003,
the day before I met Leonard.

10:32.063 --> 10:33.863
You heard him, no.

10:33.865 --> 10:35.164
Hang on.

10:35.166 --> 10:37.467
Wait, you actually
think it's 2003?

10:37.469 --> 10:39.469
No, just because
I'm living my life

10:39.471 --> 10:41.904
like it was 12 years ago
doesn't mean I'm delusional.

10:41.906 --> 10:43.639
And since it is 2003,

10:43.641 --> 10:45.441
I don't know who you are,

10:45.443 --> 10:47.376
so please exit the premises

10:47.378 --> 10:50.012
before I call the police
on my stylish new flip phone.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here

11:05.312 --> 11:07.079
Are you doing okay?

11:07.081 --> 11:08.547
I guess.

11:08.549 --> 11:10.782
I'm just, you know,
worried about Sheldon.

11:10.784 --> 11:12.651
Well, come on,
he's a grown man in his 30s

11:12.653 --> 11:14.286
pretending to be
a grown man in his 20s.

11:14.288 --> 11:15.487
He's fine.

11:16.290 --> 11:18.657
I hope so.

11:18.659 --> 11:20.692
What else can you do?
Move back in with him?

11:20.694 --> 11:22.194
No, of course not.
I-I just feel bad.

11:22.196 --> 11:23.361
Well, so do I,

11:23.363 --> 11:25.731
but don't you want to live
with your wife

11:25.733 --> 11:27.265
and set the thermostat

11:27.267 --> 11:28.366
to whatever you want

11:28.368 --> 11:29.901
and have your body tell you

11:29.903 --> 11:31.570
when it's time to go
to the bathroom,

11:31.572 --> 11:32.604
you know, not a schedule slipped

11:32.606 --> 11:35.140
underneath your door
every morning?

11:35.142 --> 11:38.376
I did like that he had
the weather on it.

11:39.847 --> 11:41.980
Trust me,
this is the right thing.

11:41.982 --> 11:43.215
I know.

11:43.217 --> 11:44.816
And it's not like
we're abandoning him.

11:44.818 --> 11:45.984
Plus,

11:45.986 --> 11:48.320
we can FaceTime him
whenever we want,

11:48.322 --> 11:52.257
you know, once iPhones
are invented in his universe.

11:55.596 --> 11:58.230
I can't believe Sheldon

11:58.232 --> 11:59.564
asked you to be his roommate.

11:59.566 --> 12:03.201
I can't believe
he ran my credit.

12:03.203 --> 12:05.704
Hey, if you're open to living
with someone great,

12:05.706 --> 12:08.173
I'll give you $1,000
to take Stuart.

12:09.209 --> 12:11.109
You really should've gone
on the Internet

12:11.111 --> 12:13.044
and checked how long
that kind of thing lives

12:13.046 --> 12:14.946
before you got one.

12:14.948 --> 12:16.515
I'm sorry.

12:16.517 --> 12:17.716
I just thought you might have

12:17.718 --> 12:20.685
a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole
in your life.

12:20.687 --> 12:23.054
Hey, I know Sheldon's quirky,

12:23.056 --> 12:24.823
but he's also brilliant
and insightful.

12:26.026 --> 12:28.760
I think calling him a weirdo
is a little unfair.

12:28.762 --> 12:31.129
Hello, 2003!

12:33.867 --> 12:36.034
Hey, we brought you Thai.

12:38.005 --> 12:39.304
Where is everything?

12:39.306 --> 12:41.306
In my present,
it's in the future.

12:41.308 --> 12:43.909
In your present,
it's been crammed in the bedroom

12:43.911 --> 12:45.343
by an enterprising young man

12:45.345 --> 12:48.280
I met in The Home Depot
parking lot.

12:49.316 --> 12:50.816
I know what you're doing.

12:50.818 --> 12:52.918
You're trying to get attention
so we'll feel bad for you,

12:52.920 --> 12:54.386
but it's not happening.

12:54.388 --> 12:56.254
No, what I'm doing
is trying to figure out

12:56.256 --> 12:58.857
how to live my life now
that everyone is leaving me.

12:58.859 --> 13:01.126
Will you knock it off?
We're across the hall.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.995
As the kids are saying today,
"talk to the hand."

13:05.432 --> 13:07.432
They're not saying that.

13:07.434 --> 13:10.502
They are in 2003.

13:10.504 --> 13:13.171
No, they're really not.

13:15.843 --> 13:18.677
♪ Thor and Dr. Jones ♪

13:18.679 --> 13:21.193
♪ Thor and Dr. Jones ♪

13:21.195 --> 13:22.728
♪ One runs from Loki ♪

13:22.730 --> 13:26.265
♪ The other runs from stones. ♪

13:27.067 --> 13:29.334
So, what do you think?

13:29.336 --> 13:31.436
Wow.

13:31.438 --> 13:34.406
Runs from stones means
that-that big boulder,

13:34.408 --> 13:36.675
but I couldn't rhyme anything
with boulder.

13:36.677 --> 13:39.111
Colder, shoulder,

13:39.113 --> 13:40.579
soldier, folder...

13:40.581 --> 13:42.314
Right, yeah, right.

13:42.316 --> 13:43.849
But...

13:43.851 --> 13:45.684
what do you think?

13:45.686 --> 13:47.519
I think it's very cute.

13:47.521 --> 13:49.154
Cute? It's not cute.

13:49.156 --> 13:52.190
Cute is children dressed
as vegetables.

13:54.228 --> 13:56.828
Okay, fine, it's not cute.

13:56.830 --> 13:58.397
Just be honest.
You don't like it.

13:58.399 --> 13:59.564
I didn't say that.

13:59.566 --> 14:02.000
I-I just like music
you can dance to.

14:02.002 --> 14:03.835
You can dance to this!

14:03.837 --> 14:05.704
Um, uh, uh...

14:05.706 --> 14:08.607
♪ Thor and Dr. Jones ♪

14:08.609 --> 14:10.976
♪ Thor and Dr. Jones ♪

14:10.978 --> 14:12.311
♪ One plays with lightning ♪

14:12.313 --> 14:15.080
♪ The other plays with bones. ♪

14:16.951 --> 14:19.418
I'm telling you, dude,
the song has no groove.

14:19.420 --> 14:21.453
You can't dance to it.

14:21.455 --> 14:23.055
Who cares?

14:23.057 --> 14:24.923
I thought the whole point
of Footprints on the Moon

14:24.925 --> 14:27.492
was to write songs
that make people think.

14:27.494 --> 14:28.827
You can do both,

14:28.829 --> 14:31.363
like Michael Jackson's
"Billie Jean."

14:31.365 --> 14:32.631
While you're dancing
you're thinking, like,

14:32.633 --> 14:35.400
"Darn it, whose baby is it?"

14:37.838 --> 14:39.338
Where's this coming from?

14:39.340 --> 14:41.773
A few hours ago,
we both loved this song.

14:41.775 --> 14:43.108
I still love it.

14:43.110 --> 14:45.043
I just think there's
room for improvement.

14:45.045 --> 14:47.713
You played it for Emily,
didn't you?

14:47.715 --> 14:49.381
Yeah, so what?
You are such a wimp.

14:49.383 --> 14:51.984
She didn't like it,
now you don't like it.

14:51.986 --> 14:55.020
No, no. I'm just evolving
as a musician.

14:55.022 --> 14:57.689
You're the one who's stuck
in the past.

14:57.691 --> 15:00.459
The past was lunch!

15:02.396 --> 15:04.062
You know
what's really happening here?

15:04.064 --> 15:07.132
Your girlfriend
is breaking up our band.

15:08.569 --> 15:09.901
She has nothing to do with this.

15:09.903 --> 15:11.203
I am my own man.

15:11.205 --> 15:12.604
Oh, please. Your brain belongs

15:12.606 --> 15:14.840
to whoever's willing
to sleep with you.

15:14.842 --> 15:16.074
That is so not true.
Really?

15:16.076 --> 15:17.542
Remember when you were gonna
get circumcised

15:17.544 --> 15:19.678
for Rachel Bernstein?

15:19.680 --> 15:22.180
That had nothing to do
with Rachel.

15:22.182 --> 15:25.183
It was an overreaction
to a bad zipper injury.

15:28.122 --> 15:29.521
I don't need this.

15:29.523 --> 15:31.623
I'm quitting the band!

15:31.625 --> 15:32.924
Fine, I quit, too!

15:32.926 --> 15:34.393
Then get out of my house!

15:34.395 --> 15:36.595
With pleasure!

15:39.333 --> 15:40.832
(door slams)

15:40.834 --> 15:44.403
(sighs)

15:44.405 --> 15:45.437
Raj, wait.

15:45.439 --> 15:47.639
What took you so long?

15:50.077 --> 15:51.143
LEONARD:
Buddy, I know me

15:51.145 --> 15:53.478
moving in with Penny
feels like a big change,

15:53.480 --> 15:54.813
but it's not.

15:54.815 --> 15:56.014
How can you say that?

15:56.016 --> 15:57.015
Amy's gone,

15:57.017 --> 15:58.617
and you two are married now,

15:58.619 --> 16:01.319
so it's only a matter of time
before you're gone, too.

16:01.321 --> 16:02.788
Okay, you don't know
what's gonna happen.

16:02.790 --> 16:03.955
No, I do.

16:03.957 --> 16:05.524
Eventually you'll want
more space,

16:05.526 --> 16:06.892
and you'll move into a house,

16:06.894 --> 16:09.061
and then instead of dinner
a couple of times a week,

16:09.063 --> 16:10.629
it'll only be a couple
of times a month,

16:10.631 --> 16:11.830
and then it'll only be

16:11.832 --> 16:13.131
on special occasions,

16:13.133 --> 16:16.468
like when Bernadette
divorces Wolowitz.

16:17.304 --> 16:19.004
Or-or-or like

16:19.006 --> 16:20.605
when Koothrappali's
weird girlfriend

16:20.607 --> 16:23.108
admits where she buried
his body.

16:24.812 --> 16:26.044
Or Amy's wedding,

16:26.046 --> 16:28.713
where she's marrying
someone better than me.

16:28.715 --> 16:31.183
Okay, look,

16:31.185 --> 16:33.285
we don't need
to rush into anything.

16:33.287 --> 16:34.586
All right?

16:34.588 --> 16:37.155
Maybe instead of Leonard
moving in with me,

16:37.157 --> 16:40.025
we just leave things
the way they are,

16:40.027 --> 16:41.326
and...

16:41.328 --> 16:42.894
sometimes we'll sleep
over there,

16:42.896 --> 16:45.363
and sometimes
we'll sleep over here.

16:45.365 --> 16:48.033
But mostly here.

16:49.203 --> 16:50.602
Sure.

16:50.604 --> 16:52.671
W-W-What about what you
said in the restaurant?

16:52.673 --> 16:53.705
Well, it's not forever.

16:53.707 --> 16:55.307
It's just for a while.

16:55.309 --> 16:58.677
If you want, we can think of him
like he's our dog.

16:58.679 --> 17:00.812
You can.

17:01.582 --> 17:03.215
I'm happy when you come home.

17:04.384 --> 17:06.451
And I'm scared of fireworks.

17:06.453 --> 17:09.988
And by the way, on July Fourth,
we're all sleeping here.

17:09.990 --> 17:12.257
Fine.

17:12.259 --> 17:13.358
All right, great!

17:13.359 --> 17:14.559
Just give me one minute,

17:14.560 --> 17:16.728
and I'll get started
on a new Roommate Agreement.

17:16.730 --> 17:17.863
Yeah.
