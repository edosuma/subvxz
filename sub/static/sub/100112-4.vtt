19:44.210 --> 19:45.540
How?

19:45.540 --> 19:49.250
When David was there
and I showed up,

19:49.250 --> 19:52.080
you had the same expression
as this guy

19:52.080 --> 19:54.210
caught with 10 pounds of cocaine
in his ass.

19:57.670 --> 20:00.170
You lied to me.

20:00.170 --> 20:02.460
I asked you and the kids
to move in with me,

20:02.460 --> 20:03.670
and you said
you couldn't

20:03.670 --> 20:05.500
because of what your father
had been through.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.460
Now I find out
it's 'cause of David?

20:08.460 --> 20:10.330
Please.

20:10.330 --> 20:12.250
There's got to be something
I can do to make this right.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.250
Mnh. I'm sorry.
I'm done.

20:15.830 --> 20:18.170
Wait.
So, are you firing me?

20:18.170 --> 20:20.290
Look, you can relax,
alright?

20:20.290 --> 20:22.710
Unfortunately,
I need you,

20:22.710 --> 20:25.830
which is a real miscalculation
on my part.

20:25.830 --> 20:31.500
So, we are going to
work together, awkwardly,

20:31.500 --> 20:33.960
for eight hours a day,
five days a week,

20:33.960 --> 20:35.500
because
we're professionals.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.960
I'm gonna go get a coffee.
You want one?

20:38.960 --> 20:40.750
Sure.
That'd be nice.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.080
Write down
what you want

20:42.080 --> 20:44.580
and then
carry that with you

20:44.580 --> 20:46.710
in case you're ever at a place
that sells coffee.

20:49.210 --> 20:50.920
[ Door closes ]

20:53.960 --> 20:55.330
[ Distorted mooing ]

20:55.330 --> 20:58.210
[ Both laugh ]

20:58.210 --> 21:00.500
Oh, my God.
[ Chuckles ]

21:00.500 --> 21:04.040
We've been doing the cow
for like 20 minutes.

21:04.040 --> 21:06.500
Wait. No.
It's only been 2 minutes.

21:08.330 --> 21:09.960
Harris, are you crazy?

21:09.960 --> 21:11.670
In case you haven't noticed,

21:11.670 --> 21:14.250
we've got addiction problems
in our family.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.620
And you --
who does your ink?

21:16.620 --> 21:17.750
It's fabulous.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.040
I know she was talking,

21:22.040 --> 21:24.830
but all I heard was,
"Mooooo!"

21:24.830 --> 21:26.460
[ Laughs ]
