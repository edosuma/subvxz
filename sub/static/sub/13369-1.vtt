BEING BACK TOGETHER WITH GIL
AGAIN SOMETIMES.

DON'T WORRY, I GET OVER
THAT ONE REAL FAST.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.571
BUT THE TRUTH IS, I'M NOT
READY TO START DATING.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.486
I'M NOT EVEN INTERESTED.

WHEN GOD MIGHT SNEAK UP

13:13.140 --> 13:15.011

YOU SEE, GOD HAS A PLAN

READY FOR IT OR NOT.

13:26.849 --> 13:30.200
JARED CALLED HIS FATHER
TODAY AND LEFT A MESSAGE.

CALLED HIM BACK.

ISN'T ROWENSFIELD
NEAR FORT SEBASTIAN?

13:49.698 --> 13:51.265

THE BASE A LITTLE MORE.

13:51.308 --> 13:53.180
IT'S ABOUT 25 MILES
DOWN THE INTERSTATE.

THAT PAPER AND PEN?

14:02.102 --> 14:03.886
- WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA
WRITE HIM BACK?

14:03.930 --> 14:06.628

20:47.507 --> 20:50.727
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S PLAY
SOME BASEBALL.

21:01.564 --> 21:03.566
ALL RIGHT, JARED.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.133
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MOSTIMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT BASEBALL?

21:05.176 --> 21:06.700
- NO.
- IT'S FUN. COME ON.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.484
LET'S GO.

21:08.528 --> 21:11.095
THAT'S IT.
YOU READY?

21:11.139 --> 21:12.227
GET THAT.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.099
THROW IT BACK.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.537
WOW.
WOW, ALL RIGHT.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.016
JUST GET IN FRONT OF THE BALLLIKE YOU'RE DOING, ALL RIGHT?

21:22.368 --> 21:25.109
NICE, MAN.

21:25.153 --> 21:26.807
NICE CATCH, MAN.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.339
OH, WOW, MAN.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.127
WELL, YOU'VE GOT A GOOD,
NATURAL EYE FOR CATCHING,

21:43.171 --> 21:44.999
THAT'S FOR SURE.YOUR HITTING'S ALL RIGHT TOO.

21:45.042 --> 21:47.001
NOW YOUR THROWING,
WE'LL WORK ON.

21:47.044 --> 21:49.264
YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST
STARTED PLAYING BASEBALL

21:49.308 --> 21:51.527
WHEN I WAS A KID,
I WASN'T MUCH GOOD.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.616
BUT LIKE YOU,
I COULD CATCH,

21:53.660 --> 21:56.097
SO I BECAME A CATCHER.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.316
THAT WAY, WHEN I LEARNED
HOW TO THROW,

21:57.359 --> 21:59.100
I COULD STILL
HELP MY TEAM OUT.

21:59.143 --> 22:01.145
DO YOU KNOW IF THEY PICKED
A CATCHER FOR THE TEAM YET?

22:01.189 --> 22:03.191
- I THINK THEY'RE GONNA DECIDEAFTER THE FIRST PRACTICE.

22:03.234 --> 22:04.801
- WELL, ALL RIGHT.
LET'S MAKE YOU A CATCHER.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.676
PITCH TO ME.

22:09.719 --> 22:13.375
- OH. [laughs]

22:13.419 --> 22:14.768
ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?
- I'M GONNA STAND HERE.

22:14.811 --> 22:16.335
- FIRST THINGS FIRST.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.554
FEET SHOULDER-WIDTH,

22:18.598 --> 22:20.121
SQUARIN' THEM UP
WITH YOUR BODY, ALL RIGHT?

22:20.164 --> 22:22.036
- YEAH.
- GET DOWN THERE,

22:22.079 --> 22:23.211
CROUCHED DOWN.
- I CROUCH?

22:23.254 --> 22:25.779
- GIVE THE PITCHER
A BIG OLD TARGET.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.650
- JARED, WATCH OUT.

22:30.131 --> 22:31.350
- AH.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.047
THE KEY TO CATCHING,

22:33.090 --> 22:34.353
ALWAYS GET
IN FRONT OF THE BALL.

22:34.396 --> 22:35.745
YOU DON'T WANT TO LET IT GET
TO THE BACKSTOP,

22:35.789 --> 22:37.138
ALL RIGHT?
'CAUSE THEY'LL STEAL A BASE.

22:37.181 --> 22:38.357
YOU READY TO TRY IT?
- YEAH.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.098
- ALL RIGHT,
GET OVER THERE.

22:41.142 --> 22:43.623
THAT'S IT.
GOOD.

22:43.666 --> 22:45.102
WAY TO MEASURE IT UP.

22:45.146 --> 22:48.062
- THEN CROUCH AND TARGET.

22:48.105 --> 22:49.629
- LOOK AT YOU.YOU'RE A CATCHER ALREADY, MAN.

22:49.672 --> 22:52.719
- [laughs]

22:52.762 --> 22:54.938
- NICE THROW, LADY.

22:57.637 --> 22:58.812
ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?

22:58.855 --> 22:59.682
- YEAH.
- IT'S COMING AT YOU.

23:02.293 --> 23:04.252
ALL RIGHT, WAY TO STAY
IN FRONT OF THE BALL.

23:04.295 --> 23:06.385
THAT WAS GOOD.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.430
WELL, WE'LL WORK ON THAT.

23:10.345 --> 23:12.086
ALL RIGHT, WAY TO GET
IN FRONT OF THE BALL.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.393
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.133
- SO WERE YOU GOOD AT BASEBALLWHEN YOU WERE YOUNG?

23:16.177 --> 23:18.353
- WHOA, MAN,

THAT I'M OLD?

23:25.360 --> 23:26.840
- NO, YOU'RE NOT OLD.
YOU'RE--

23:26.883 --> 23:29.190
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN IT.
UHH!

23:29.233 --> 23:30.844
- IT'S OKAY.
WE KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.802
[laughs]

23:32.846 --> 23:34.282
- SO WERE YOU GOOD
AT BASEBALL?

23:34.325 --> 23:35.501

23:35.544 --> 23:37.328
I HAD LOADS OF FUN,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

23:37.372 --> 23:38.852

23:38.895 --> 23:41.463

SERGEANT CARRERA HAS, UH,

HE NEEDS TO BE DOING.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.338

NOW YOU PROMISE
YOU'RE GONNA ASK THE COACH

24:01.788 --> 24:03.354

DANA.

24:14.496 --> 24:17.107
LIKEWISE.

24:37.737 --> 24:40.348
- HE HAS GOOGLED
EVERY CATCHER

24:40.391 --> 24:43.525
SINCE ABNER DOUBLEDAY
INVENTED THE GAME.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.310
THAT SERGEANT REALLY LEFT
A BIG IMPRESSION ON JARED.

24:46.354 --> 24:48.704
- I COULD HAVE NEVER TAUGHT HIMEVERYTHING HE TAUGHT HIM.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.924
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW PATIENTHE WAS WITH JARED.

24:50.967 --> 24:53.187
HE WAS TOTALLY THERE
JUST FOR HIM.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.406
- GOD WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

24:55.450 --> 24:56.756
IS HE CUTE?

24:56.799 --> 24:58.714

24:58.758 --> 25:00.934
- I KNOW,
BUT IF YOU HAD NOTICED.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.718
- YES, YOU WOULD SAY
HE WAS CUTE,

25:02.762 --> 25:04.241
AND I AM NOT READY
TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

25:07.767 --> 25:10.944
- OKAY, YOU GUYS,
ARE YOU READY?

25:10.987 --> 25:13.337
- GO ON.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.782
- CAN I TRY OUT

25:22.825 --> 25:24.392
- HAVE YOU EVER
SUITED UP BEFORE?

25:24.435 --> 25:26.525
- NO, BUT SERGEANT CARRERA SAYSI'M GOOD AT CATCHING.

25:26.568 --> 25:29.571
- AND WHO IS
SERGEANT CARRERA?

25:29.615 --> 25:30.920
IT DOESN'T MATTER. SURE YOU

25:30.964 --> 25:32.400
SUIT UP,
AND YOU CAN DO IT

ALL RIGHT.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.506
- HEY, WE'RE GOING OUT
FOR HAMBURGERS AFTER THIS.

26:35.550 --> 26:37.900
DO YOU WANT TO COME?
- OH, UH, JARED,

26:37.944 --> 26:39.641
VINCE HAS SPENT MOST OF
THE AFTERNOON WITH US.

26:39.685 --> 26:42.426
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD QUIT
WHILE WE'RE AHEAD.

26:42.470 --> 26:45.429
- PLEASE, MOM?
- WELL, IT'S NOT UP TO ME,

26:45.473 --> 26:46.909
BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE

26:46.953 --> 26:49.477
YOU'D BE MORE THAN WELCOME.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.957
- YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T MIND
JOINING YOU,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.350
ON ONE CONDITION.

26:53.394 --> 26:54.351
MY TREAT.

26:54.395 --> 26:56.615
- OH, NO, WE--
WE COULDN'T.

26:56.658 --> 27:00.706
- I DON'T THINK
I COULD MAKE IT THEN.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.317
- OKAY, AT TIMES LIKE THIS,
MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME

27:03.360 --> 27:06.059
TO GIVE IN GRACIOUSLY
AND SAY THANK YOU.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.452
- MY PLEASURE.

27:08.496 --> 27:09.932
SO DID YOU GET
YOUR CATCHER'S GEAR YET?

27:09.976 --> 27:12.326
- MM, HE GETS IT
NEXT WEEK.

27:12.369 --> 27:13.632
THE TEAM SUPPLIES IT
THIS YEAR,

27:13.675 --> 27:14.850
AND THEN WE HAVE TO BUY IT
FOR HIM NEXT YEAR.

27:14.894 --> 27:15.938
- OH, THAT MEANS
HE'S GONNA GIVE YOU

27:15.982 --> 27:17.418
A NEW CATCHER'S MITT.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.072
IT'S GONNA BE ALL STIFF
AS A BOARD.

27:19.115 --> 27:20.464
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT,
THOUGH.

27:20.508 --> 27:23.032
SO I GOT YOU THIS.

27:23.076 --> 27:23.990
IT'S WHAT THEY USE
IN THE MAJORS.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.513
SOFTEN THAT MITT
RIGHT UP.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.515
- WOW.

27:27.558 --> 27:30.431
- WHAT DO YOU SAY, JARED?
- THANKS.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.085
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

27:32.128 --> 27:36.393
- THAT WAS REALLY
THOUGHTFUL OF YOU.

27:36.437 --> 27:37.873
YOU KNOW, I GOT THE FEELING
THAT WHEN YOU SAID

27:37.917 --> 27:39.092
YOU HAD A LOT OF FUN PLAYING
BASEBALL IN HIGH SCHOOL

27:39.135 --> 27:42.008
THAT YOU WERE BEING MODEST.

27:42.051 --> 27:45.054
- WELL, I WAS OFFERED A TRIPLE-ACONTRACT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL,

27:45.098 --> 27:47.535
BUT YOU KNOW, ALL I EVER WANTEDTO DO WAS BE IN THE ARMY,

27:47.578 --> 27:50.494
SO I DIDN'T SIGN IT.

27:50.538 --> 27:51.670
PLUS I COULDN'T
HIT A CURVE BALL,

27:51.713 --> 27:52.932
SO THE MAJOR LEAGUES
WERE A LONG-SHOT.

27:52.975 --> 27:54.847
- YOU COULD HAVE GONE PRO.

27:59.068 --> 28:01.636
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP
AT THIS HOUR?

28:01.680 --> 28:03.986
- I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SENSEOF SOME NEW SOFTWARE,

28:04.030 --> 28:05.466
CAD SOFTWARE THEY USE
AT THE OFFICE.

28:05.509 --> 28:07.990
- I CAN'T HELP YOU THERE.

28:08.034 --> 28:11.385
IT TOOK ME THREE WHOLE NIGHT
COURSES AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE

28:11.428 --> 28:12.560
JUST TO LEARN HOW TO EMAIL
AND GOOGLE.

28:12.603 --> 28:14.518
[laughs]

28:14.562 --> 28:16.433
- OH, I JUST--
I FEEL SO OVERWHELMED.

28:16.477 --> 28:17.696
EVERYTHING'S CHANGED
SO MUCH.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.567
I'M AFRAID I'M NEVER
GOING TO CATCH UP.

28:19.610 --> 28:21.569
AND I'M ON PROBATION UNTIL
MY FIRST EVALUATION.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.136
- AND THEN THEY WILL REALIZE

28:23.179 --> 28:25.486
HOW LUCKY THEY ARE
TO HAVE YOU.

28:25.529 --> 28:28.402
- I KNOW. I KNOW THAT I AM
37 YEARS OLD,

28:28.445 --> 28:30.143
BUT I FEEL LIKE I AM SEVEN,
AND I WOULD LIKE YOU

28:30.186 --> 28:33.146
TO WAVE YOUR MAGIC MOM WAND

28:33.189 --> 28:34.669
LIKE YOU DID
WHEN I WAS A CHILD

28:34.713 --> 28:36.018
AND MAKE EVERYTHING OKAY
AGAIN.

28:36.062 --> 28:38.455
- THE NICE THING
ABOUT GROWING UP

28:38.499 --> 28:40.153
IS THAT YOU GET TO WAVE
YOUR OWN WAND.

28:40.196 --> 28:42.111
YOU'RE WORKING HARD ENOUGH.

28:42.155 --> 28:46.594
ALL YOU NEED IS SOME FAITH
IN YOURSELF.

28:46.637 --> 28:48.509
[laughs]

28:48.552 --> 28:52.731
MMM.
THAT POPCORN SMELLS GOOD.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.558
- OH, IT'S SO GOOD.

28:54.602 --> 28:55.995
- MMM.
- [laughs]

28:56.038 --> 28:58.040
I'M GONNA HAVE
SOME OF THAT.

29:01.740 --> 29:02.784

TO MAKE SURE I WAS

29:10.792 --> 29:12.707
WHEN WE WAS OVER IN BOSNIA.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.448

29:14.491 --> 29:16.667

29:16.711 --> 29:17.973
ARE YOU GOING ON A DATE TONIGHT,YOU SLY DOG?

29:18.017 --> 29:19.801
- NAH, IT'S NOT A DATE.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.063
REMEMBER THAT KID WHO WAS
WRITING THOSE LETTERS

29:21.107 --> 29:23.152
OVER IN BOSNIA?
- YEAH, YEAH.

29:23.196 --> 29:24.545
- I'M COACHING HIM

29:24.588 --> 29:26.460
- OKAY, OKAY,

29:26.503 --> 29:28.114
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE DATING AGAIN,YOU KNOW,

29:28.157 --> 29:29.202
LIZ HAS GOT A WHOLE ROLODEX
FULL OF WOMEN

29:29.245 --> 29:30.464

29:30.507 --> 29:32.858
IS THE BOY'S MOM
AT LEAST CUTE?

29:32.901 --> 29:35.469
[laughs]

29:35.512 --> 29:36.775
- LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

29:36.818 --> 29:39.734
WHAT PART OF "I'M NOT LOOKING"DID YOU NOT GET?

29:39.778 --> 29:41.649
- THE "N"? NO, NO, NO.
IT WAS THE "O," RIGHT?

29:41.692 --> 29:43.477
MAYBE THE "T"?

29:43.520 --> 29:45.696
NOW I'M NOT LOOKING,
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

29:45.740 --> 29:46.654
BUT TELL LIZ THANKS
ANYWAY, ALL RIGHT?

29:46.697 --> 29:49.135
- YOU GOT IT.
[laughs]

29:51.746 --> 29:54.618
- OH, JARED, LOOK.

29:54.662 --> 29:56.664

THE WAY YOU TWO DO.

46:36.663 --> 46:39.144
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU JUST

01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:29.408
- OKAY, WELL, IF NOT DRAFTING,WHAT?

01:08:29.453 --> 01:08:33.935
- WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,
I WANTED TO BE AN ARCHITECT.

01:08:33.979 --> 01:08:37.024
YOU KNOW, DESIGN BEAUTIFUL HOMESFOR PEOPLE.

01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:40.116
BUT DRAFTING WAS THE BEST
PLAN "B" AVAILABLE.

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:44.032
- WELL, I SAY GO BACK
TO PLAN "A" THEN.

01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:46.470
YOU KNOW, GO BACK TO SCHOOL.
BECOME AN ARCHITECT.

01:08:46.513 --> 01:08:49.386
THEY HAVE NIGHT SCHOOL,
THEY HAVE PART-TIME.

01:08:49.429 --> 01:08:50.822
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

01:08:50.865 --> 01:08:53.433
AND WHERE THERE'S A WILL...

01:08:53.477 --> 01:08:57.045
WE'RE ONLY ON THIS EARTH
ONCE SO...

01:08:57.089 --> 01:08:59.178
WE MIGHT AS WELL DO WHAT GOD
PUT US HERE TO DO, RIGHT?

01:09:01.441 --> 01:09:02.616
- THANK YOU.

01:09:09.014 --> 01:09:12.452
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO.
- ALL RIGHT, DANA.

01:09:12.496 --> 01:09:16.456
GOOD NIGHT.

01:09:20.504 --> 01:09:22.462
- DID VINCE LEAVE?
- YES.

01:09:22.506 --> 01:09:25.944
MOM, WHAT WOULD THINK ABOUT MEGOING TO NIGHT SCHOOL?

01:09:25.987 --> 01:09:27.598
- TO DO WHAT?
- ARCHITECTURE.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.035
- [gasp]

01:09:30.078 --> 01:09:31.470
IT'S SOMETHING YOU'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO DO.

01:09:31.515 --> 01:09:33.037
- I WOULD KEEP MY DAY JOB,

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.996
BUT WOULD NEED HELP WITH JAREDAT NIGHT,

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.085
AND IT MIGHT MEAN US LIVING HERELONGER THAN WE THOUGHT.

01:09:37.129 --> 01:09:38.609
IS THAT OKAY?

01:09:38.652 --> 01:09:40.437
- OOH.
I DON'T KNOW.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:46.051
THE WAY I SEE IT,
I WIN ON ALL FRONTS.

01:09:46.094 --> 01:09:48.618
- THANK YOU!
OH, THANK YOU.

01:09:48.662 --> 01:09:49.968
I'M EXCITED.
- YOU'LL DO GREAT.

01:09:50.011 --> 01:09:53.058
- OH, I KNOW.
[sigh]

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.581
- FINALLY, SERGEANTS,

01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:57.497

01:09:57.541 --> 01:09:59.891
AS THE FIRST OF A DEPLOYMENT

01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:01.414
- WE'RE SHIPPING OUT.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE.

01:10:01.458 --> 01:10:04.243
- THE COLONEL HAS ORDERED
THAT WE DO A FULL INVENTORY

01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:07.028
OF ALL EQUIPMENT, STORES,
UNIFORMS, ET CETERA.

01:10:07.072 --> 01:10:08.465
IF IT BREATHES, SALUTE IT.

01:10:08.508 --> 01:10:10.423
IF IT DOESN'T,
PUT IT ON THE LIST.

01:10:10.467 --> 01:10:12.077
WHAT IS IT, SERGEANT?

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.035
- ANY IDEA WHEN WE'RE SHIPPINGOUT, SERGEANT MAJOR?

01:10:14.079 --> 01:10:15.211

01:10:15.254 --> 01:10:16.647
A FULL D.R.A.

01:10:16.690 --> 01:10:18.431
WHY, WHEN, WHERE, AND EVEN IFWE'RE GOING,

01:10:18.475 --> 01:10:22.261
YOU'LL KNOW WHEN I KNOW.

01:10:26.483 --> 01:10:27.440
- DUDE, YOUR MOVE.

UH, LET'S SEE.

01:10:31.705 --> 01:10:34.055
THERE YOU GO.

01:10:34.099 --> 01:10:34.969
- ARE YOU SURE YOU WANNA
DO THAT?

01:10:35.013 --> 01:10:37.668
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

01:10:37.711 --> 01:10:40.236
KING ME.

01:10:44.718 --> 01:10:45.719

01:10:48.113 --> 01:10:50.420
[footsteps]

01:10:53.727 --> 01:10:55.512
- ARE YOU OKAY?

01:10:55.555 --> 01:10:56.687
YOU'VE BEEN SOMEWHERE ELSE
ALL EVENING.

01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:58.602
- OH, YEAH.

01:10:58.645 --> 01:11:01.082
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST--

01:11:01.126 --> 01:11:04.477
I'M JUST TIRED,
THAT'S ALL.

01:11:04.521 --> 01:11:07.001
WOULD YOU MIND IF I CALLED ITAN EARLY NIGHT TONIGHT?

01:11:07.045 --> 01:11:08.438
- GO HOME AND GET SOME SLEEP.

01:11:08.481 --> 01:11:09.656
- THANKS.

01:11:17.664 --> 01:11:18.665
- GOOD NIGHT.

01:11:37.597 --> 01:11:39.120

01:11:39.164 --> 01:11:40.992
- WHEN DO YOU LEAVE?

01:11:43.647 --> 01:11:47.999
- THEY HAVEN'T TOLD US YET.

01:12:06.278 --> 01:12:08.324
- GOOD NIGHT.

01:12:08.367 --> 01:12:10.151
I LOVE YOU.

01:12:10.195 --> 01:12:13.024
- MOM?

01:12:13.067 --> 01:12:14.199
- HEY, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ASLEEP.

01:12:14.242 --> 01:12:15.722
- ARE YOU OKAY?

01:12:15.766 --> 01:12:18.159
YOU SOUND KINDA SAD.
- I DO?

01:12:18.203 --> 01:12:21.380
I'M SORRY.

01:12:21.424 --> 01:12:25.602
VINCE'S UNIT IS GETTING READYTO SHIP OUT AGAIN.

01:12:25.645 --> 01:12:27.081
- WHEN?

01:12:27.125 --> 01:12:28.779
- HE DOESN'T KNOW YET.

01:12:28.822 --> 01:12:30.607
- I'LL MISS HIM.

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:32.609
- ME TOO.

01:12:32.652 --> 01:12:35.307
- WHAT'LL HAPPEN?

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:37.135
- WELL, YOU'LL WRITE EACH OTHER.

01:12:37.178 --> 01:12:40.747
- NO, WHAT'LL HAPPEN...
TO YOU AND HIM?

01:12:42.662 --> 01:12:43.837
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:12:47.406 --> 01:12:48.494
GOOD NIGHT.

01:12:48.538 --> 01:12:51.062
- GOOD NIGHT.

01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:59.113
- BOY, YOU'VE GOTTA BE STRONG
TO BE A SOLDIER'S WIFE.

01:12:59.157 --> 01:13:01.377
- WHAT BROUGHT THAT ON?

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.291
VINCE HASN'T ASKED YOU
TO MARRY HIM HAS HE?

01:13:03.335 --> 01:13:05.772
- [laughing]
NO.

01:13:05.816 --> 01:13:09.210
I WAS JUST THINKING.
- UH-HUH.

01:13:09.254 --> 01:13:12.300
- THEY'RE GETTING READY
TO GO OVERSEAS AGAIN SOON.

01:13:12.344 --> 01:13:15.216
- REALLY?

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.262
I THOUGHT THEY WERE STAYING
UNTIL CHRISTMAS.

01:13:17.305 --> 01:13:18.698
- MM.

01:13:18.742 --> 01:13:20.439
- WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO THE TWO OF YOU?

01:13:20.483 --> 01:13:21.658
- WELL, WE ALWAYS SAID
WE WOULD CROSS THAT BRIDGE

01:13:21.701 --> 01:13:23.529
WHEN WE CAME TO IT.

01:13:23.573 --> 01:13:25.662
THE TRUTH IS IT'S ALWAYS BEENTHERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF US

01:13:25.705 --> 01:13:27.446
LIKE A TIME LIMIT.

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:31.842
JUST KEPT US FROM MAKING ANY
OTHER PERMANENT DECISIONS.

01:13:31.885 --> 01:13:33.670
BUT...

01:13:33.713 --> 01:13:36.412
NOW THAT BRIDGE--WELL, WE'RE
GETTING READY TO CROSS IT.

01:13:36.455 --> 01:13:37.413
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HAPPEN?

01:13:37.456 --> 01:13:40.154
- I DON'T KNOW, MOM.

01:13:40.198 --> 01:13:44.115
VINCE'S WIFE LEFT HIM
WHEN HE WAS OVERSEAS.

01:13:44.158 --> 01:13:45.638
HE WAS THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAYAND THE WOMAN HE LOVED

01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:47.205
RAN OFF WITH SOMEBODY ELSE

01:13:47.248 --> 01:13:49.816
AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING
HE COULD DO ABOUT IT.

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.427
SO NO MATTER HOW WE FEEL
ABOUT EACH OTHER,

01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:56.606
I JUST DON'T THINK HE'LL RISKTHAT HAPPENING AGAIN.

01:13:56.649 --> 01:13:58.172
I'LL MISS HIM.

01:13:58.216 --> 01:13:59.522
- DO YOU LOVE HIM?

01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:01.349
- YEAH.

01:14:01.393 --> 01:14:02.655
I THINK I DO.

01:14:02.699 --> 01:14:04.788
- HAVE YOU TOLD HIM?

01:14:04.831 --> 01:14:08.748
- NO. I DON'T WANT TO PUTTHAT KIND OF PRESSURE ON HIM.

01:14:10.489 --> 01:14:12.099
NO.

01:14:18.802 --> 01:14:20.760
- ALL RIGHT, LANNY.
I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.

01:14:20.804 --> 01:14:22.458
RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO,

01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:25.156
WE SAID IT WAS OVER AS SOON
AS I GOT REDEPLOYED.

01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:27.550
WE BOTH UNDERSTOOD THAT.

01:14:27.593 --> 01:14:28.551
- RIGHT, BUT THAT WAS ONLY WHENWE WERE GONNA BE HERE

01:14:28.594 --> 01:14:30.378
TILL CHRISTMAS.

01:14:30.422 --> 01:14:31.771
WE'VE ONLY BEEN HERE
FOUR MONTHS, VINCE.

01:14:31.815 --> 01:14:35.601
- AND THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

01:14:35.645 --> 01:14:38.212
I'M THE FIRST PERSON SHE'S DATEDSINCE SHE'S BEEN DIVORCED.

01:14:38.256 --> 01:14:40.214
SHE'S STILL GETTING BACK
ON HER FEET.

01:14:40.258 --> 01:14:41.564
I CAN'T ASK HER TO WAIT A YEARFOR ME, MAN.

01:14:41.607 --> 01:14:43.348
LOOK.

01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:45.176
SHE'S INTELLIGENT,
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

01:14:45.219 --> 01:14:47.308
SHE'S FUN TO BE WITH.SHE NEEDS TO DATE OTHER GUYS.

01:14:47.352 --> 01:14:49.441
- LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:54.446
DO YOU LOVE HER?

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:55.795
- I THINK I DO.

01:14:55.839 --> 01:14:57.797
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING...

01:14:57.841 --> 01:14:59.407
NO, I HAVEN'T TOLD HER.

01:14:59.451 --> 01:15:01.409
LOOK, LANNY,
YOU NEVER BEEN DIVORCED

01:15:01.453 --> 01:15:03.281
AND I PRAY YOU NEVER ARE.

01:15:03.324 --> 01:15:06.414
LIZ, SHE'S--WELL, SHE'S ONE IN A MILLION.

01:15:06.458 --> 01:15:08.721
BUT THE LAST THING DANA NEEDS
RIGHT NOW IS TO BE TIED DOWN

01:15:08.765 --> 01:15:10.636
TO SOMEONE WHO'S
A THOUSAND MILES AWAY

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:11.942
WHILE SHE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUTWHO SHE IS AND WHAT SHE WANTS

01:15:11.985 --> 01:15:14.597
TO DO THE REST OF HER LIFE.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.338
ALL RIGHT?

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:26.304
SO WE STILL ON FOR THE BBQ
ON FRIDAY?

01:15:26.347 --> 01:15:27.914

01:15:34.399 --> 01:15:36.836
THANK YOU.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.273
- FOR WHAT?

01:15:39.317 --> 01:15:41.928
- THE LAST FEW MONTHS.

01:15:41.972 --> 01:15:45.236
SOME OF THE BEST TIMES
I CAN REMEMBER.

01:15:45.279 --> 01:15:46.542
- OH, BABY,
WHERE'D THAT COME FROM?

01:15:46.585 --> 01:15:49.240

01:15:49.283 --> 01:15:50.850

COMMANDER HAS DECIDED TO EXPANDIT BY DETACHMENT,

01:16:15.005 --> 01:16:16.833
AND THAT DETACHMENT IS US.

01:16:16.876 --> 01:16:19.270
SERGEANTS, WE ARE GOING TO HELP.

01:16:19.313 --> 01:16:20.010

WHERE IT WILL THEN TAKE CIVILIANAIRCRAFT TO THE FLORIDA BASE.
