00:26.650 --> 00:28.356
Now, let’s turn it over
to Themb/ Wallace

00:28.520 --> 00:30.647
for an update
on the Danny Rand in vest/'gaﬁons.

00:30.820 --> 00:32.230
One source suggests that Danny Rand

00:32.400 --> 00:33.947
may na ve been using his own business

00:34.160 --> 00:37.152
to smuggle m/l/ions of dollars
of Illegal drugs.

00:37.410 --> 00:39.731
And though
Rand continues to elude capture,

00:39.990 --> 00:41.651
the New York DEA has placed him

00:41.830 --> 00:44.742
at the top of their list
of most wanted fugitives.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.583
This Is Thembi Wallace reporting
from Downtown Manhattan.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.871
- Now, back to sports.
- Thanks, Thembi

00:50.050 --> 00:52.200
Well, it was a packed house
at the arena last n/ght.

00:52.380 --> 00:53.506
Hometown fans...

01:07.940 --> 01:10.977
Sir? Sir, you can't park there.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.101
Why don't you get it washed for me?

01:32.630 --> 01:37.420
So, yes, I know for a fact that
the charges against Danny are false.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.924
Last we spoke, you seemed very much
on the anti-Danny track.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.091
Things have changed.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.305
I want to help him.

01:48.940 --> 01:51.977
Danny made a poor decision
when he attacked the DEA agents.

01:52.230 --> 01:53.470
His life is in danger.

01:53.900 --> 01:56.357
Unfortunately, I haven't had
any contact with him.

01:57.490 --> 01:59.230
Good morning. May I help you?

02:00.990 --> 02:02.150
Good morning.

02:04.410 --> 02:06.241
So if you want to help him,
perhaps you could tell me

02:06.410 --> 02:08.162
who would want to set him up in this way?

02:08.370 --> 02:09.780
Good morning, Ward.

02:11.420 --> 02:14.162
Ah, Jeri Hogarth.

02:14.460 --> 02:16.542
I see you've aged reasonably well.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.709
Hi, Dad.

02:18.970 --> 02:20.506
It's a long story.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.170
You have been faking your death
for all these years?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.676
That is fraud on the highest level.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.722
Would you mind excusing us?
I need to speak with my son.

02:40.780 --> 02:43.487
Is this wise? Stepping out in public?

02:43.700 --> 02:47.249
I'm about to re-enter the world, Ward.
The time is now.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.660
Combination the same?

02:54.130 --> 02:55.745
I didn't even know that was there.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.621
Dad, the world thinks you're dead.

03:01.260 --> 03:03.342
How are you going to explain
what happened?

03:03.510 --> 03:04.750
Oh, come on, Ward.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.636
I've had 13 years to plan this out.

03:09.810 --> 03:13.109
I spin 'em a tale about the art of
gene therapy

03:13.270 --> 03:16.569
and the tremendous advances we've made
In cryotherapy.

03:17.190 --> 03:19.943
And here I am, a new man.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.565
Dad, that's insane.

03:22.910 --> 03:26.232
Oh, the board's gonna welcome me back
with open arms.

03:29.370 --> 03:30.359
Dad!

03:32.000 --> 03:35.333
Hey... Let's be clear, Ward.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.042
You've tried to fight me before,
and you've always lost.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.087
Now, this is your last chance
to come on board.

03:43.300 --> 03:47.259
Otherwise, it's just me and Joy
running this company.

03:49.310 --> 03:50.345
And not Danny?

03:50.520 --> 03:51.589
Danny?

03:52.020 --> 03:55.353
Danny is just a drug-smuggling fugitive
from the law.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.817
I think we both know that's not true.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.480
Either way...

04:01.860 --> 04:04.272
Heroin's a big money-maker, Ward.

04:04.620 --> 04:07.362
Oh, not to mention that cure your, uh,
buddy Bakuto has.

04:07.740 --> 04:09.321
Now we'll get rich both ends.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.707
Dad. Hey!

04:11.870 --> 04:14.077
- Yeah?
- You owe Danny.

04:14.630 --> 04:15.870
He freed you from the Hand.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.332
Well, I'll send flowers to his funeral.

04:20.090 --> 04:22.877
You've been messing with Danny
ever since he's been back, haven't you?

04:23.300 --> 04:25.507
Oh, no. Since long before that.

05:49.260 --> 05:51.592
Jesus.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.175
Sorry.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.169
It's not the best time to sneak up on me.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.056
At least it's a cute picture.

05:59.020 --> 06:00.601
I got you some sneakers, too.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.026
Drug trafficking?

06:04.610 --> 06:07.488
And money laundering. They think
you were using Rand as a cover.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.482
I shut down Gao's operation.
I got the drugs out of Rand.

06:11.660 --> 06:12.786
Look, I know, but it says...

06:12.950 --> 06:14.156
I don't care what it says.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.497
I just want to know
why Harold's doing this.

06:17.410 --> 06:19.787
The moment I free him,
he stabs me in the back?

06:20.040 --> 06:21.621
You don't wanna start
down that rabbit hole.

06:22.250 --> 06:23.831
It won't lead anywhere helpful,
believe me.

06:27.380 --> 06:28.506
I'm such a jerk.

06:29.930 --> 06:31.090
I haven't even asked how you're doing.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.510
Okay, I guess.

06:37.270 --> 06:38.885
It's all kind of overwhelming.

06:41.190 --> 06:43.146
Running from the DEA's
been a nice distraction.

06:44.190 --> 06:45.225
Glad I could help.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.989
Every second we spend running
is a second we should be fighting back.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.616
What are we supposed to do?

06:55.080 --> 06:57.241
Find out what evidence
the DEA has against me,

06:57.540 --> 06:58.905
figure out a way to refute it.

06:59.830 --> 07:01.320
I need to get in touch with Hogarth.

07:01.670 --> 07:02.955
Okay. Yeah.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.837
But maybe we shouldn't
contact her directly.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.160
We don't know where the DEA's eyes are.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.795
We need a messenger.

07:24.650 --> 07:25.685
Hey.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.929
I was asked to give you something.

07:29.900 --> 07:30.946
A client needs you.

07:31.530 --> 07:34.021
Five dollars will get you
exactly two seconds of my time.

07:34.870 --> 07:35.905
Please, take it.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.570
"J-Money."

07:42.790 --> 07:43.996
I can take you to him.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.170
Look who I found.

07:56.850 --> 07:57.965
Huh.

07:59.350 --> 08:02.262
As an officer of the court, I'm obliged
to tell you to turn yourself in.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.221
You really think that's a good idea?

08:04.480 --> 08:05.799
No, of course not.

08:06.020 --> 08:08.352
You're a billionaire
facing federal drug charges.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.567
You might as well have the words
"Flight Risk" stamped on your forehead.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.408
You surrender,
and you will end up in a jail cell

08:15.570 --> 08:18.289
for 6 to 12 months minimum
before this even goes to trial.

08:18.450 --> 08:20.827
Trust me,
our criminal justice system sucks.

08:21.580 --> 08:24.629
Look, did you find out what evidence
the DEA has against Danny?

08:24.960 --> 08:26.166
I'm sorry, who are you?

08:26.630 --> 08:27.870
Colleen Wing.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.792
Oh, wonderful.
Another fugitive from the law.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.757
The DEA considers both of you
armed and dangerous.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.670
They will not hesitate to shoot.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.388
Colleen,
you are being charged with assault,

08:38.680 --> 08:40.716
obstructing justice,
and abetting a fugitive.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.557
So, you have some problems
of your own to focus on.

08:43.980 --> 08:45.186
- Shit.
- Look, it's okay.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.762
Just put her on my tab. Please.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.811
The DEA, this is what they've given me.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.235
These are from the Hand tablet.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.440
What, you've seen these documents before?

09:03.500 --> 09:04.660
They've been changed.

09:06.540 --> 09:07.746
It must've been Harold Meachum.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.241
You know. You know that he's alive then?
I just saw him.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.539
Where?

09:11.760 --> 09:14.297
Rand Enterprises. Ward's office.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.422
Ward tried to warn me that
Harold was gonna call the DEA on me.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.467
You know, I...
I wish that I could say I'm surprised,

09:21.640 --> 09:23.176
but back when I interned at Rand,

09:23.350 --> 09:25.511
I learned very quickly
not to trust Harold.

09:26.940 --> 09:30.068
I just... I just wonder why he would be
faking his death for all these years.

09:30.230 --> 09:31.606
He didn't fake it.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.697
He really died.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.449
Let's make a list of things
that you are never allowed to say again,

09:38.660 --> 09:40.116
starting with that.

09:40.530 --> 09:43.283
Now, if you still have the tablet,
I could... I could get it analysed.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.827
Maybe prove that the documents
were forged.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.246
I gave it to Harold.

09:48.830 --> 09:51.128
Back when I was stupid enough
to think we were on the same side.

09:52.090 --> 09:53.205
Is there anything else we can do?

09:54.260 --> 09:57.548
The way I see it,
you have three options.

09:58.510 --> 10:01.502
You can... Go back to Xanadu,

10:01.760 --> 10:05.173
or wherever the hell it is that you were
for 15 years, and never look back.

10:05.850 --> 10:08.683
Or you can turn yourself in
and we can try to fight this in court.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.358
But given the evidence,
the best I can do is beg for a plea deal.

10:12.940 --> 10:13.929
And the third option?

10:15.030 --> 10:16.179
Prove your innocence.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.599
Those documents are digital.

10:18.820 --> 10:21.323
There's a very good chance
that they've been copied somewhere.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.691
Can you think of anyone
who might have them?

10:24.370 --> 10:25.496
Yeah.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.861
The one person
I trust even less than Harold.

10:40.720 --> 10:41.846
You hear anything?

10:43.180 --> 10:44.169
No.

10:44.850 --> 10:45.965
It's silent.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.526
There's at least 50 teenagers
living in there.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.190
Silent is the last thing it should be.

11:00.820 --> 11:02.060
You think it's deserted?

11:02.660 --> 11:03.900
I mean, we took out their leader.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.189
Maybe they ran.

11:06.790 --> 11:08.109
Only one way to find out.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.667
Where would they go?

11:12.920 --> 11:14.035
I don't know.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.297
There's so much I don't know.

11:42.530 --> 11:43.519
Here it is.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.200
Gao?

11:53.330 --> 11:54.456
They left you here?

11:55.290 --> 11:57.338
No food? No water?

11:57.590 --> 11:58.875
I’ve suﬁ‘ered worse.

12:00.260 --> 12:02.080
There are metal screens on those windows.

12:03.010 --> 12:04.170
You could have escaped.

12:04.640 --> 12:08.383
And miss your visit? Heavens, no.
I’ve been looking forward to this.

12:09.180 --> 12:11.557
You ’re sounding rather anxious,
Danny Rand.

12:11.730 --> 12:12.765
I need information.

12:13.310 --> 12:14.971
Why should I tell you anything?

12:15.360 --> 12:18.477
Because if you don't, I'll cut off
your head and feed it to the rats.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.736
That does not sound pleasant.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.022
I need access to everything
that was on the tablet I took from you.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.902
I purged all that information
from my computers.

12:28.450 --> 12:30.327
- There are no other copies?
- There are not.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.035
You're lying.

12:32.540 --> 12:34.451
I have never lied to h/m.

12:35.710 --> 12:37.371
Can you say the same?

12:54.140 --> 12:55.596
Tell me what I need to know.

12:55.940 --> 12:58.852
It's no mystery
why you're such a poor Iron Fist.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.277
You don't understand your own path.

13:01.990 --> 13:06.154
Your chi is so polluted with guilt,
yet you refuse to face it.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.577
And what should I be guilty of?

13:08.780 --> 13:10.190
The death of your parents.

13:12.830 --> 13:15.458
That makes no sense.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.450
You watched them both die,

13:17.880 --> 13:21.543
yet somehow,
you survived with barely a scratch.

13:21.760 --> 13:26.083
How many nights did you lie awake,
asking yourself, "Why did I live?"

13:27.590 --> 13:30.002
So what? I was just a kid.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.883
"Child touched by fire."
Isn't that how it goes?

13:36.350 --> 13:38.352
And now that child has grown up.

13:38.650 --> 13:41.437
And guilt is such
an uncomfortable feeling, isn't it?

13:41.610 --> 13:44.488
Much easier to burn it
in the flames of anger.

13:44.900 --> 13:46.310
You think you're so clever...

13:47.110 --> 13:48.316
with these little mind games.

13:48.950 --> 13:52.238
And that's the real reason why you left
K'un-Lun, isn't it?

13:52.620 --> 13:54.827
Your thirst for vengeance.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.993
You wanted someone to pay for
the death of your mother and father.

13:59.170 --> 14:01.411
I didn't even know it was murder
until after I left.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.410
You were only ten years old,

14:03.630 --> 14:05.666
but you were smart enough to know

14:05.840 --> 14:09.332
that airplanes don't drop
from the slq for no reason.

14:09.590 --> 14:10.636
We're wasting our time here.

14:11.470 --> 14:12.346
Danny.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.090
If what you're saying is true...

14:16.430 --> 14:18.091
Then why haven't I killed you already?

14:18.270 --> 14:21.933
Because you know
I didn't kill your parents.

14:22.400 --> 14:26.894
Why would I have gone to such trouble
to hide it with a plane crash?

14:28.610 --> 14:31.989
It was someone
much more treacherous than I.

14:32.780 --> 14:35.783
In fact, I tried to talk him out of it...

14:36.330 --> 14:40.699
...as I thought it would
draw too much unwanted attention.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.029
She is playing mind games.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.955
She's trying to get you on her side.

14:44.130 --> 14:46.200
The side of truth and honesty.

14:47.050 --> 14:48.586
Who else would kill my parents?

14:48.760 --> 14:51.137
Stop thinking like a child.

14:51.930 --> 14:55.559
Who would benefit most from the death
of the Rand family?

14:55.720 --> 14:57.176
- No one.
- Are you sure?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.390
- The Meachums, but...
- But what?

15:04.020 --> 15:05.726
Harold was my father's best friend.

15:05.900 --> 15:08.448
He seems to have no problem
hurting you now.

15:09.150 --> 15:10.777
You were in the plane as well.

15:13.410 --> 15:16.117
Harold was diagnosed with cancer.

15:16.580 --> 15:19.401
At most he had two, three years to live.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.627
We offered him the deal,
and he leapt at it.

15:23.250 --> 15:26.128
He set up our heroin operation in China.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.667
But when your father
was about to discover all this,

15:29.840 --> 15:31.796
Harold feared
that he would ruin everything.

15:39.270 --> 15:42.398
He seemed very enthused by the idea.

15:44.360 --> 15:49.525
You will only gain the strength
of a real Iron Fist

15:49.820 --> 15:51.356
after you have killed Harold.

15:51.780 --> 15:54.317
You must rid yourself of this anger.

15:55.910 --> 15:59.402
You have two doors ahead of you,
Danny Rand.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.405
Pass through one,

16:01.670 --> 16:06.869
and it will lead you to fulfil your
destiny as the true Iron Fist.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.040
The other door...

16:12.590 --> 16:14.251
- What?
- I don't know.

16:15.390 --> 16:19.212
Those who walk through that door
are never heard from again.

16:19.390 --> 16:21.176
Let's go. Let's go.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.187
Let's hope your minions find you
before you rot.

16:30.070 --> 16:33.062
There are no locks strong enough
to imprison the truth.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.492
He's been lying to me.

16:41.910 --> 16:43.286
Manipulating me.

16:45.420 --> 16:48.628
He's been pretending to be...
Be my friend. I...

16:49.800 --> 16:51.836
Danny, I'm so sorry.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.920
He's not gonna get away with this.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.466
I'll help you. I'll do whatever I can.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.886
Danny, we just need to get to the tablet.

17:04.060 --> 17:05.766
That's all we need to prove
your innocence.

17:05.940 --> 17:07.805
Anything else we leave
to the cops.

17:10.610 --> 17:12.430
He's gonna pay for what he's done.

17:15.780 --> 17:18.522
He will pay, Danny.
He's gonna go to prison.

17:21.450 --> 17:23.327
I used to think my mum was still alive.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.451
She... She landed on a snow bank...

17:28.460 --> 17:29.666
Broke a leg...

17:31.130 --> 17:32.506
But she was still alive.

17:34.260 --> 17:35.295
Out there...

17:36.800 --> 17:38.540
Waiting for me to come and find her.

17:39.260 --> 17:40.966
Do you know how crazy that is?

17:42.970 --> 17:44.301
I kept trying to escape.

17:45.270 --> 17:46.510
Over and over.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.603
I'd get to the edge of K'un-Lun,
and it would just be this...

17:51.110 --> 17:52.850
This blizzard everywhere.

17:53.150 --> 17:54.139
This...

17:55.240 --> 17:56.639
This howling wind.

18:00.910 --> 18:02.946
And I could hear her...

18:05.330 --> 18:06.649
Yelling out for me.

18:09.170 --> 18:10.535
But there was no way out.

18:12.210 --> 18:17.625
Danny, you're not the first friend of mine
with special powers.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.671
They're all dark, haunted people.

18:23.470 --> 18:26.098
You know, when I first met you
in Colleen's dojo,

18:26.270 --> 18:28.556
I couldn't help but notice
that you had this...

18:29.020 --> 18:30.601
sweet innocence.

18:31.020 --> 18:32.976
But the more you continue to fight
against something

18:33.150 --> 18:36.483
that happened 15 years ago,
a fight you can't possibly win,

18:37.150 --> 18:38.731
the darker you become.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.366
I can win any fight!

18:40.740 --> 18:43.322
Danny, some shit you just can't punch.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.363
You know you weren't given this gift
so that you could commit murder.

18:47.660 --> 18:48.911
And I know that you think that

18:49.080 --> 18:52.083
killing Harold is gonna make you
feel better,

18:52.250 --> 18:54.912
that it's somehow gonna make
everything okay, but it's not.

18:55.170 --> 18:57.161
She's right, Danny. You can't kill Harold.

18:57.630 --> 18:58.676
I can.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.249
And I will.

19:00.430 --> 19:01.749
Please, just listen.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.007
I was raised on the Bushido code, okay?

19:05.430 --> 19:08.422
From the time I could pick up a sword,
I was taught to never harm another

19:08.600 --> 19:10.648
for personal reasons, but Bakuto?

19:12.360 --> 19:15.067
I really wanted to kill Bakuto.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.356
But I'm glad that in the end,
it was Davos and not me,

19:18.530 --> 19:20.236
otherwise I'd spend the rest of my life

19:20.410 --> 19:23.948
wondering if I killed a man
for the wrong reasons.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.822
I think that if you kill Harold
out of your own vengeance...

19:30.120 --> 19:31.451
It'll corrupt your chi.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.996
You'll never be the Iron Fist
you're meant to be.

19:38.420 --> 19:40.502
Which is whyI have to kill Harold
for you.

19:41.470 --> 19:42.755
What? Jesus!

19:43.220 --> 19:45.677
Is there a version of this
where we don't kill someone?

19:46.890 --> 19:48.881
The tablet. How do we get the tablet?

19:49.060 --> 19:50.186
Ward.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.893
He texted you to warn you
about the DEA, right?

20:00.900 --> 20:01.980
Hey.

20:02.860 --> 20:03.986
You're looking better.

20:04.780 --> 20:06.236
What are you doing here?

20:07.990 --> 20:09.491
I don't want to see you right now.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.491
I know. And I don't blame you.

20:13.330 --> 20:14.319
Then leave.

20:16.670 --> 20:19.377
I'm sorry about what happened.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.500
Which part?

20:21.800 --> 20:24.132
When you tried to kill Dad,
or when you failed to do it?

20:24.510 --> 20:25.966
I'm sorry that you got hurt.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.881
I swear I was trying to protect you.

20:31.350 --> 20:32.931
Who said I needed protecting?

20:33.140 --> 20:36.553
As long as you think that thing
is our father, I say so.

20:37.190 --> 20:40.102
Hey, he is dangerous. Joy...

20:40.650 --> 20:43.448
Every second you spend with him
could be your last.

20:44.860 --> 20:46.407
Do you hear how crazy you sound?

20:47.410 --> 20:49.230
Dad has been held prisoner for 13 years.

20:49.410 --> 20:51.571
So, of course he's acting a little off.
Who wouldn't?

20:51.790 --> 20:54.418
A little off?

21:03.930 --> 21:07.047
I watched him go at two dead men
with a claw hammer.

21:08.220 --> 21:10.518
I can tell you where he made me
dump the bodies.

21:11.890 --> 21:14.267
I'm not going anywhere with you.
You're the one who scares me, Ward.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.509
I feel like I can't even...

21:19.940 --> 21:21.567
I can't even trust a word you say.

21:23.030 --> 21:25.908
I mean, you've been lying to me...

21:27.070 --> 21:28.276
All these years.

21:30.030 --> 21:31.361
That was Dad's decision.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.536
But you went along with it.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.456
What about the drug abuse?

21:37.460 --> 21:39.030
Who forced you to lie about that?

21:40.630 --> 21:41.790
That's not...

21:44.010 --> 21:45.295
That's different.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.676
I'm an asshole and a liar,
I don't dispute that.

21:53.850 --> 21:55.010
I'm not lying about Dad.

21:55.180 --> 21:56.181
Just stop.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.857
I can't do this anymore.

21:59.060 --> 22:00.049
I won't.

22:00.610 --> 22:01.929
You need to get yourself some help.

22:02.980 --> 22:04.777
And whatever your problem is with Dad...

22:05.610 --> 22:06.816
it's your problem.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.276
- I'd like you to leave now.
- No.

22:11.740 --> 22:13.742
I'm not going anywhere
until you understand

22:13.910 --> 22:15.400
why I did what I did last night.

22:15.660 --> 22:16.649
I don't care.

22:25.590 --> 22:26.750
What?

22:27.630 --> 22:29.427
Danny, I got your text.

22:32.060 --> 22:35.097
Tablet's in a safe in the office,
but I don't know the combination.

22:35.640 --> 22:37.380
All right. Just...
Just get rid of him.

22:37.770 --> 22:39.055
I'll take care of the rest.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.932
There are armed bodyguards posted
outside the building.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.480
I'll deal with it.

22:45.650 --> 22:48.528
Great. The sooner we can get
Dad locked up, the better.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.400
Why are you helping me?

22:53.240 --> 22:54.229
I'm helping me.

22:54.700 --> 22:56.861
I want Dad put away
just as much as you do.

22:57.830 --> 22:59.070
I seriously doubt that.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.628
You think your
being on the run for one day

23:02.790 --> 23:04.951
can compare to my lifetime of abuse?

23:07.130 --> 23:08.336
He killed my parents.

23:10.050 --> 23:12.041
He caused my plane to crash.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.301
How? How do you know this?

23:18.310 --> 23:19.595
Gao told me.

23:20.980 --> 23:21.969
Jesus.

23:24.270 --> 23:25.430
Danny, I'm sorry.

23:30.660 --> 23:33.311
Danny? Danny, are you okay?

23:36.950 --> 23:39.407
I'm gonna put an end to your father.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.552
Who are your new friends?

23:55.720 --> 23:58.712
Joy, what are you doing here?
You shouldn't be out of the hospital.

23:58.890 --> 24:00.687
Yeah, I had to get out of there.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.682
Yeah. Look...
I'm no fan of hospitals myself.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.179
I'll get the car to run you home.

24:05.860 --> 24:06.929
No.

24:07.860 --> 24:10.021
I don't want to go home.
I need to talk to you.

24:10.990 --> 24:12.230
Ward said I could find you here.

24:12.990 --> 24:16.824
Ah, well, uh... I'll, uh,
I'll drop by later.

24:18.660 --> 24:22.414
Hey, I'll get some soup from that, uh,
noodle place you like on 6th Street.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.371
How do you know about that?

24:26.090 --> 24:27.660
Well, you're my daughter.

24:28.670 --> 24:30.251
That place opened up last year.

24:32.430 --> 24:35.217
So, what does that mean? My...
My dead father's been spying on me?

24:35.680 --> 24:38.888
Oh, Joy, I think you need a little rest.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.686
Why did you frame Danny?

24:43.730 --> 24:44.799
I didn't.

24:46.020 --> 24:49.183
I saw everything that you had
on the Hand's drug operation.

24:49.980 --> 24:50.981
Remember?

24:51.320 --> 24:53.606
Danny's name wasn't on any of it, so...

24:54.530 --> 24:55.690
tell me the truth.

24:56.570 --> 24:57.696
Okay.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.234
Well, the, uh...

25:00.500 --> 25:04.072
The...
The truth is I didn't show you everything.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.070
You know, I needed your help, but I...
I didn't wanna upset you.

25:07.250 --> 25:10.208
I know how much Danny means to you.
So I...

25:11.050 --> 25:13.757
withheld certain documents.

25:14.340 --> 25:16.922
Now, look, I'm... I'm sorry
if that was the wrong decision.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.462
Okay. Show them to me now.

25:21.140 --> 25:23.631
Well, I can't.
I gave everything to the DEA.

25:24.230 --> 25:25.345
- Bullshit.
-Joy”.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.260
Information is power, right, Dad?

25:27.690 --> 25:29.646
You have been telling me that
since I was a little girl,

25:29.820 --> 25:31.936
so I don't believe for a second
that you didn't keep

25:32.110 --> 25:33.429
- something for yourself.
- Hey. Hey, Joy,

25:33.610 --> 25:34.850
I'm telling you the truth.

25:35.150 --> 25:38.529
You know, you saw how familiar Danny
was with those people from the Hand.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.327
He's been working with them
the whole time.

25:40.490 --> 25:43.197
He's been selling drugs to them
from our company.

25:43.370 --> 25:44.610
You did it.

25:44.910 --> 25:46.537
You actually did. You set him up.

25:46.750 --> 25:49.287
- What? Did Danny tell you that?
- No. I haven't seen him.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.542
Whatever he's saying about me,
he is lying.

25:51.710 --> 25:53.416
- I haven't seen him.
- Hey, don't protect hIm, Joy.

25:53.670 --> 25:55.046
- That is exactly what he wants.
- Dad, look...

25:55.220 --> 25:58.758
He is trying to turn you against me,
just like he did with Ward.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.466
He won't stop
until he destroys our family.

26:01.810 --> 26:05.018
But, so help me,
I will not let that lying piece of shit

26:05.180 --> 26:07.432
take what is rightfully mine.

26:14.860 --> 26:16.270
Then look me in the eye...

26:17.740 --> 26:19.480
And tell me you didn't do it.

26:20.990 --> 26:23.652
That's insane.
I swear on my life I didn't do that.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.369
Hey.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.041
Joy, sweetheart...

26:33.210 --> 26:34.290
Don't...

26:36.170 --> 26:37.159
Don't touch me.

26:37.380 --> 26:38.369
Joy.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.091
Joy, don't let him beat us.

26:42.180 --> 26:43.420
You're stronger than that.

26:45.430 --> 26:46.510
Joy!

26:49.020 --> 26:50.009
Joy!

27:06.120 --> 27:07.189
Joy.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.422
So, everyone knows what they're doing?

28:06.100 --> 28:08.386
- Yes.
- Okay.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.931
You're gonna need this.

28:13.020 --> 28:15.477
I don't know.
As much as Hogarth would give me.

28:30.580 --> 28:31.786
Mm-hm.

28:34.580 --> 28:35.569
Sure.

28:36.170 --> 28:37.205
Mm-hm.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.046
Okay.

28:40.210 --> 28:41.336
VVhen?

28:43.130 --> 28:44.631
Okay. Uh...

28:56.360 --> 28:58.897
It’s me. It can ’t be tonight.

28:59.650 --> 29:02.949
I know what] said
but it’s not just the guards outside.

29:03.320 --> 29:06.232
Dad has his own armed guards upstairs.

29:06.780 --> 29:09.328
Unless you're bulletproof,
we have to wait.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.360
What was that?

29:13.870 --> 29:16.282
Why do you always make me do things
like that?

29:16.920 --> 29:18.080
What just happened?

29:18.840 --> 29:20.080
Sounds like Harold found out.

29:20.460 --> 29:22.291
Then we get out of here. It's not safe.

29:22.470 --> 29:24.961
No, the plan stays the same.
We can't just leave Ward up there.

29:25.380 --> 29:27.177
The plan was to go up if it's clear.

29:27.340 --> 29:29.501
Maybe that means something different
in K'un-Lun, but in New York,

29:29.680 --> 29:31.591
guys with guns is the opposite of clear.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.010
If Ward needs help, let's call the police.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.976
We can't wait for the police.

29:36.980 --> 29:38.390
Harold is dangerous.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.680
Let's not pretend that you care about Ward

29:41.570 --> 29:43.390
when we know
what this IS really about for you.

29:44.990 --> 29:46.196
I'm going in there.

29:46.530 --> 29:48.521
Let's just think about this. Danny!

29:49.580 --> 29:51.229
- Damn it.
- He's gonna get himself killed.

29:54.830 --> 29:56.536
- I can't let him do this alone.
- Colleen!

29:56.710 --> 29:59.588
- Claire, we stick to the plan.
- Just get... Just get the tablet!

30:00.000 --> 30:02.048
Tell me you're not gonna
try to kill Harold!

30:02.840 --> 30:04.546
Shit! Shit! Shit!

30:18.900 --> 30:19.935
How much for your cart?

30:20.190 --> 30:22.897
- Only thing I'm selling is peanuts.
- This enough?

30:25.070 --> 30:26.310
Get out of here.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.366
Get out of here!

30:46.510 --> 30:47.875
Shit!

30:49.390 --> 30:50.630
What the hell?

31:00.150 --> 31:02.471
Go get her. I'll go around the back.

31:02.980 --> 31:05.312
Stop right there, ma'am. Stop!

31:07.110 --> 31:09.442
Hey! You looking for me?

31:29.880 --> 31:31.757
Guns. Shit.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.349
Yeah.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.856
Just got a call
from our guards downstairs.

31:48.940 --> 31:49.941
Danny Rand is here.

31:51.070 --> 31:52.150
Ah.

31:58.910 --> 32:01.663
Remember, Iron Fist or not,
he's not bulletproof.

32:01.870 --> 32:03.167
Let's get ready for him.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.951
Dad, no.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.120
This way!

32:49.840 --> 32:50.875
There he is!

33:23.410 --> 33:24.866
You move, and I'll hit you again.

34:23.640 --> 34:25.426
Danny, I hope like hell
you know what you're doing.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.069
Colleen!

34:51.460 --> 34:53.621
Hey. Hey, we're okay.

34:55.090 --> 34:56.079
Danny!

34:57.840 --> 34:58.829
Hey.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.295
I got it.

36:00.610 --> 36:02.316
They're on the roof.

36:02.780 --> 36:04.190
He is gonna get himself killed.

36:15.210 --> 36:16.746
You know, funny thing, Danny.

36:16.920 --> 36:19.161
Last time I was up here
was with your father.

36:34.770 --> 36:36.726
Building wasn't even open yet.

36:39.610 --> 36:42.147
We came up here
and looked down at New York.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.230
We had the world at our feet.

36:46.700 --> 36:48.941
We were standing
on that little ledge over there.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.576
And here's the funny part.

36:54.790 --> 36:57.839
I had this overwhelming urge
to push Wendell over.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.539
No reason.

37:00.210 --> 37:01.586
He's my friend.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.171
Just one of those things.

37:21.940 --> 37:25.444
I look back on my life now,
and I think that's my greatest regret.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.026
That I didn't kill Wendell then...

37:30.120 --> 37:32.327
Before you were even born.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.241
Oh, you destroyed my family!

37:39.840 --> 37:41.205
You're wrong, Harold!

37:42.920 --> 37:45.502
The funny part is that
now I'm gonna kill you.

37:47.010 --> 37:51.595
You destroyed everything!
My family! Your family!

37:53.100 --> 37:55.307
All I wanted was to have
my family beside me.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.227
But you turned them against me.

37:57.940 --> 38:01.432
Now, vengeance is the only thing
I'm interested in.

38:03.190 --> 38:06.694
I won't eat, I won't sleep,
I won't stop...

38:07.700 --> 38:09.406
Until you've paid the price.

38:25.590 --> 38:26.966
Come on.

38:27.130 --> 38:29.633
Without that fist, you're just
another screwed up little kid...

38:29.800 --> 38:31.961
...who won't go where I go.

38:38.690 --> 38:39.759
I can go there.

38:40.110 --> 38:41.316
It's my choice!

38:41.480 --> 38:43.607
Oh, but you won't.
That's why you're gonna die.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.179
Better that than to live like you.

38:45.610 --> 38:47.817
Hated by those who should love you
no matter what.

38:48.610 --> 38:50.692
- Ward. Joy.
- Stop!

39:12.510 --> 39:15.513
You know the truth, Harold!
It's time to face it!

39:27.740 --> 39:32.564
You wﬂl only ga/n
the strength of a real Iron Fist

39:32.780 --> 39:34.611
after you have k/l/ed Harold.

39:34.790 --> 39:37.247
You must rid yourself of this anger.

39:37.410 --> 39:38.741
Joy!

39:40.420 --> 39:41.785
- No!
- Mum!

39:42.080 --> 39:43.081
No!

39:43.250 --> 39:44.285
I love you, Danny.

40:04.650 --> 40:05.639
Oh.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.060
Oh, Danny boy.

40:09.860 --> 40:12.408
Come here. You come here.

40:12.860 --> 40:15.613
Come here. Give your Uncle Harold a hug.

40:19.700 --> 40:20.826
Finish me off.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.991
No. No.

40:23.210 --> 40:24.871
Come on, finish me off.

40:38.430 --> 40:40.011
I ’ve been here before.

40:45.810 --> 40:47.937
Come out of the darkness so I can see you.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.706
The battle is won.

41:02.370 --> 41:03.997
Oh, yeah?

41:04.370 --> 41:05.701
I'm through with you, Harold.

41:07.090 --> 41:10.799
I've wasted too many years hating
whatever it is you are.

41:13.880 --> 41:15.211
You're going to prison.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.097
Only this time,

41:18.310 --> 41:22.178
it's gonna be nowhere near as nice
as the one you spent the last 13 years in.

41:32.530 --> 41:33.645
Danny!

42:27.000 --> 42:28.490
I'm sorry it all came down to this.

42:29.880 --> 42:34.704
Thank you for... being here.

42:36.970 --> 42:41.134
Despite everything, this is...
still my father's body.

42:45.020 --> 42:46.931
And I didn't want to do this alone.

42:48.690 --> 42:49.839
Any news from Joy?

42:51.270 --> 42:52.259
No.

42:52.610 --> 42:53.770
Nothing.

42:54.360 --> 42:58.399
Danny, Ward. I was told I'd find you here.

42:58.950 --> 43:00.736
We could have met you at the office.

43:00.990 --> 43:04.539
Oh, you know me...
I always enjoy a good cremation.

43:06.040 --> 43:07.325
Heard anything else?

43:07.580 --> 43:09.036
Yeah, I just... I just got off the phone

43:09.210 --> 43:11.997
with the agent in charge
of the New York DEA.

43:12.420 --> 43:13.956
In light of the fact that you were set up

43:14.130 --> 43:16.542
and are going to be making
a very generous contribution

43:16.720 --> 43:18.711
to the DEA's Widows' and Children's Fund,

43:19.180 --> 43:21.045
they are dropping all the charges,

43:21.850 --> 43:24.466
including the assault
against their officers.

43:25.850 --> 43:26.919
Congratulations.

43:30.730 --> 43:32.470
- Now what?
- Don't know.

43:33.570 --> 43:36.277
Up to you. You... You are a free man.

43:37.280 --> 43:39.100
You should come back to Rand.

43:40.950 --> 43:44.442
We can run the company together,
the way our fathers should have.

43:44.620 --> 43:46.190
Well...

43:48.040 --> 43:49.576
I'm not really a good businessman.

43:52.210 --> 43:54.371
Yeah. I'm gonna miss Dad.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.950
Who will I blame for my...

43:58.510 --> 44:01.422
failures, my weaknesses...

44:02.260 --> 44:04.842
...my unhappiness?

44:06.560 --> 44:07.800
I understand.

44:08.480 --> 44:11.517
I've spent my whole life feeling like
my parents were watching over me.

44:12.520 --> 44:13.805
I really didn't realise

44:13.980 --> 44:16.357
there was going to be so much
emotional honesty.

44:17.030 --> 44:19.601
Right. Let's, uh... Let's do this.

44:50.730 --> 44:51.879
- Danny.
- Hey...

44:52.190 --> 44:53.680
I brought pizza.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.679
Doesn't look as fancy as last time.

44:56.860 --> 45:00.102
Well, I'm trying to go beyond
what my father taught me.

45:01.740 --> 45:03.105
I see you're keeping up your training.

45:03.570 --> 45:06.733
Yeah, well... Kind of like it.

45:08.120 --> 45:09.906
She's my only student left.

45:10.200 --> 45:12.657
You know, you got a gift
for working with troubled kids.

45:13.040 --> 45:14.530
I'm pretty sure I could get Rand

45:14.620 --> 45:17.919
to sort out some kind of scholarship
or something.

45:18.210 --> 45:20.917
I don't hate the idea,
but I need time to think about it.

45:21.340 --> 45:22.625
What are your plans, Danny?

45:23.130 --> 45:24.540
I've been giving it a lot
of thought and...

45:26.390 --> 45:27.709
I think I'm gonna go back to K'un-Lun.

45:30.390 --> 45:33.382
Look, I...
I need to explain to Lei Kung why I left.

45:34.100 --> 45:36.341
It was wrong for me
to leave the way that I did.

45:36.730 --> 45:38.391
I also need to complete my training.

45:39.070 --> 45:41.607
There's still so much
I don't know about being an Iron Fist.

45:41.940 --> 45:43.988
Yeah, look...

45:45.740 --> 45:47.526
I'm saying this as a friend...

45:49.410 --> 45:51.742
But you two share a lot in common.

45:53.250 --> 45:56.208
No, that's... Not a good thing.

45:57.920 --> 46:01.128
Your first instinct to a problem
is to respond with violence.

46:02.510 --> 46:04.751
I guess what I'm saying here is...

46:05.050 --> 46:09.714
You're both pretty effed up
and need some serious psychological help.

46:11.930 --> 46:12.919
All right.

46:14.020 --> 46:15.840
I gotta get out of here. Uh...

46:17.270 --> 46:20.398
I believe these are mine.

46:31.830 --> 46:33.149
Wow.

46:37.170 --> 46:38.364
So, K'un-Lun, huh?

46:39.330 --> 46:40.410
Mm.

46:44.130 --> 46:45.165
I'm...

46:45.590 --> 46:48.582
I'm still trying to figure out
who I'm gonna be as the Iron Fist.

46:50.600 --> 46:53.171
Lei Kung taught me
that I was a powerful weapon...

46:53.640 --> 46:55.847
A flame meant to destroy our enemies.

46:58.350 --> 47:02.229
But I keep thinking that...
Maybe I can be something else.

47:04.530 --> 47:08.022
A light...
For those trapped in the darkness.

47:13.410 --> 47:15.822
There's a lot of darkness right here
in New York.

47:17.250 --> 47:18.399
Yeah.

47:20.210 --> 47:22.531
There's also a little light, too.

47:28.510 --> 47:31.923
I'll miss you... while you're gone.

47:36.390 --> 47:37.971
Well, I was...

47:39.020 --> 47:42.512
I was kind of hoping that...
you'd come with me.

47:57.410 --> 47:58.957
Good morning, sir.

48:32.070 --> 48:35.278
Even though Danny Rand
physically survived the plane crash,

48:35.990 --> 48:38.447
it seems the boy you knew died that day.

48:39.750 --> 48:41.490
Becoming the Iron Fist changed him.

48:42.830 --> 48:43.819
Maybe.

48:44.130 --> 48:46.496
He destroys everything he touches.

48:49.130 --> 48:51.542
Isn't it true your world fell apart
after his return?

48:54.430 --> 48:55.670
Things changed for me.

48:57.760 --> 49:00.388
And you know that if you have
any hope of returning to your old life...

49:01.480 --> 49:02.469
he must be removed.

49:02.890 --> 49:03.936
Removed?

49:04.730 --> 49:05.936
Killed.

49:09.480 --> 49:10.777
I can help you with that.

49:15.620 --> 49:16.769
I'm listening.

49:39.600 --> 49:40.635
How much further?

49:41.720 --> 49:42.766
Almost there.

49:45.100 --> 49:46.931
It's gonna look completely different
from this.

49:48.020 --> 49:50.932
Much warmer. Trees. Green.

49:51.990 --> 49:54.891
I can almost smell the stew
that Rabten keeps going day and night.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.902
We should get there just in time
for afternoon kung fu practice.

50:00.660 --> 50:01.820
You're gonna love it.

50:10.340 --> 50:11.580
What is it?

50:15.970 --> 50:17.085
It's blood.

50:21.970 --> 50:23.096
Are they monks?

50:35.740 --> 50:36.855
No.

50:38.570 --> 50:39.730
They're Hand.

50:58.510 --> 50:59.636
It's gone.

51:01.260 --> 51:04.093
Gone? Gone where?

51:07.520 --> 51:08.635
I don't know.

51:10.190 --> 51:11.396
But I should have been here.

51:14.070 --> 51:15.389
It's all my fault.
