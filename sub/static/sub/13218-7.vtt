[inmates talking indistinctly]

01:20.375 --> 01:22.377
Hey, Chapman,
I was thinking, my, uh...

01:22.460 --> 01:25.087
my brother runs the Philly chapter
of Aryan Brotherhood.

01:25.171 --> 01:28.007
Maybe it's time we got connected,
make this shit official.

01:28.090 --> 01:30.385
[muffled] Uh, we are a task force, Sankey.

01:30.468 --> 01:32.220
Yeah, technically. But...

01:32.303 --> 01:34.555
isn't that 'cause we're afraid to say
we're worthy of love?

01:34.639 --> 01:35.640
White shame.

01:35.723 --> 01:37.558
We've gotta love ourselves
loud and proud.

01:37.642 --> 01:39.644
White and proud!

01:39.727 --> 01:43.105
I really do not feel comfortable
being a part of a brand.

01:52.615 --> 01:55.368
On the other hand,
there's strength in numbers.

01:55.451 --> 01:56.536
Hey!

01:56.619 --> 01:59.664
This bathroom? Not yours.

01:59.747 --> 02:01.624
I'm just checking out the water pressure.

02:01.707 --> 02:03.959
We have such long lines on our floor.

02:04.043 --> 02:06.504
I guess because there's so many of us.

02:09.089 --> 02:10.758
[grunts]

02:10.841 --> 02:13.428
-Something's up.
-Come on.

02:17.557 --> 02:20.268
Well, I guess you've found a way
to stay protected.

02:20.351 --> 02:22.728
It's too bad, you know,
there's no Hawaiian power group

02:22.812 --> 02:24.021
for me to hide behind.

02:24.104 --> 02:25.815
Oh, you'll be fine.

02:25.898 --> 02:28.359
I'm the only one that Ruiz has beef with.

02:28.443 --> 02:29.527
Probably.

02:29.610 --> 02:33.198
I jumped one of her girls, remember?
They think I'm one of your crew.

02:33.281 --> 02:35.575
Look, I cannot be responsible
for you right now.

02:35.658 --> 02:36.867
I have to be pragmatic.

02:36.951 --> 02:39.704
[scoffs] That's it?
You're throwing me to the wolves?

02:39.787 --> 02:43.208
I wouldn't say I'm throwing you to them.
I would say that wolves exist...

02:44.292 --> 02:46.126
which I am helpless
to defend you against.

02:46.211 --> 02:48.338
[Sankey] There's shit scratched
in one of the stalls.

02:48.421 --> 02:49.797
Man, what did I tell you?

02:49.880 --> 02:52.883
I mean, trying to keep these mongrel races
from making graffiti is like...

02:53.468 --> 02:56.346
trying to keep dogs from pissing,
and monkeys from throwing poop.

02:56.429 --> 02:58.973
-[Piper] Uh...
-[sighs] You ready to go?

02:59.056 --> 03:00.516
I'm right behind you.

03:02.268 --> 03:05.813
Look, if you're feeling vulnerable,
make friends, make new friends.

03:05.896 --> 03:08.233
I can't help you,
but I'm rooting for you.

03:12.945 --> 03:15.030
-[inmates arguing]
-This is the hallway.

03:15.114 --> 03:16.699
Commissary.

03:16.782 --> 03:20.245
-You remember this, when you were here?
-Oh, yeah, it's all coming back to me.

03:20.328 --> 03:22.663
Great! Here's your toothbrush.
Bye!

03:22.747 --> 03:24.582
Oh, wait, wait.
What's my bed assignment?

03:24.665 --> 03:27.042
I don't know. I drive the van.
They didn't tell you in Processing?

03:27.126 --> 03:28.419
Man, nobody told me shit!

03:28.503 --> 03:30.255
Do I just go to the dorms or what?

03:30.338 --> 03:33.883
Sorry, I can't hear you,
I'm too far away.

03:33.966 --> 03:35.218
-[sighs]
-[Stratman] All right, you, step up.

03:35.301 --> 03:36.552
Let's go.

03:37.762 --> 03:39.054
Uh, excuse me, Officer--

03:39.138 --> 03:40.348
Keep the traffic moving.

03:40.431 --> 03:41.849
Yeah, I know.
Look, I'm just wondering--

03:41.932 --> 03:43.351
Rubbernecking causes accidents...

03:43.434 --> 03:45.603
from my foot up your ass.
Got it?

03:45.686 --> 03:47.855
All right.
[clears throat] Jeez.

03:47.938 --> 03:49.649
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

03:49.732 --> 03:51.526
Hey, man, how ya doin'?

03:52.067 --> 03:53.944
Oh...
Hey.

03:54.028 --> 03:58.115
Man, you are a sight for sore eyes.
I ain't seen you in, like, forever.

03:58.198 --> 04:00.743
Yeah... I took an extended vacation.

04:00.826 --> 04:02.995
Man, what's wrong with these guys?

04:04.163 --> 04:05.998
They work for the government.

04:07.124 --> 04:08.208
Oh.

04:08.293 --> 04:10.210
Come on. Walk with me.

04:11.211 --> 04:13.298
There have been a lot of changes.

04:13.381 --> 04:15.675
I thought this place was all cool
when I first got here.

04:15.758 --> 04:17.885
Just private and clean.

04:17.968 --> 04:19.970
But now, they brought in the military

04:20.053 --> 04:22.348
and then they cracked down
on the Jewish presence.

04:22.432 --> 04:24.809
[stuttering] And now they got
cameras and drones

04:24.892 --> 04:27.186
monitoring our every activity.

04:27.270 --> 04:31.816
Plus, we are ruled by
a fascist bearded giant!

04:31.899 --> 04:33.943
Okay, I am so sorry,

04:34.026 --> 04:36.737
I, you know... [stuttering]
I just... I didn't realize.

04:36.821 --> 04:38.406
-You're crazy, and--
-No, no, no.

04:38.489 --> 04:39.824
No, no, it's my fault.
It really is because

04:39.907 --> 04:42.493
I thought I knew you,
so I engaged in this conversation

04:42.577 --> 04:45.120
thinking you'd say things that made sense.
And that is on me.

04:45.204 --> 04:46.372
[stuttering] It's the truth.

04:46.456 --> 04:47.957
Got it.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.750
Hey, you wanna know
where the cameras are?

04:49.834 --> 04:51.377
-Nah, I'm good.
-Okay.

04:54.254 --> 04:55.465
[young Lolly] <i>You read my new piece?</i>

04:55.548 --> 04:56.924
What are you doing?
You transcribing it yet?

04:57.007 --> 04:58.593
[Ann-Marie] Not until
John gives the go-ahead.

04:58.676 --> 05:00.511
-Why? What's the problem?
-Talk to John.

05:00.595 --> 05:01.637
Oh, and Lolly,

05:01.721 --> 05:05.308
I know banging it out on an old typewriter
has a certain mystique,

05:05.391 --> 05:07.643
but do us all a favor
and get yourself a computer.

05:08.603 --> 05:10.438
Buy an Amiga.
Live in the now.

05:13.273 --> 05:16.193
-[knocking]
-Hey! You didn't like my article?

05:16.276 --> 05:17.445
[John] Sit down.

05:18.946 --> 05:22.908
You have got to stop bringing me articles
without getting editorial approval.

05:22.992 --> 05:25.828
Uh, I asked you to write a review
on Kenny Rogers Roasters,

05:25.911 --> 05:27.580
not an exposé on a local business.

05:27.663 --> 05:31.501
But I gave you the Roasters review
and an exposé!

05:31.584 --> 05:33.628
No, this is a real story.

05:33.711 --> 05:38.466
Diamond Dry Cleaners haven't paid
for waste pickup in three years.

05:38.549 --> 05:40.175
So where are all the chemicals going?

05:40.259 --> 05:42.261
I think they're illegally dumping.

05:42.344 --> 05:44.972
[chuckles] Okay. First of all,
that's complete speculation.

05:45.055 --> 05:48.183
Second, we're a free weekly,
not <i>The Washington Post.</i>

05:48.267 --> 05:50.811
So what are you saying,
we're not allowed to report the news?

05:50.895 --> 05:52.312
[scoffs]

05:52.397 --> 05:54.565
Or is this a conflict of interest

05:54.649 --> 05:57.192
because you happen to like
the way they press your shirts?

05:57.276 --> 05:59.737
Uh, I'm killing the story.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.321
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:01.406 --> 06:03.449
Look, I'm sorry you wasted your time.

06:03.533 --> 06:06.994
Maybe follow procedure and check
with me first when you have a pitch?

06:08.621 --> 06:11.916
[echoing] <i>And don't go sticking your nose</i>
<i>where it doesn't belong.</i>

06:13.793 --> 06:16.211
-What?
-Hmm?

06:20.132 --> 06:21.926
[Taystee] What is this?

06:22.009 --> 06:24.429
I can't even see her.

06:24.512 --> 06:26.847
Man, man, what you mean?

06:26.931 --> 06:29.308
She right there, coming out the door.

06:29.391 --> 06:30.560
Tsk. [grunts]

06:31.561 --> 06:33.646
Maybe she a little blurry.

06:33.729 --> 06:35.648
Quite blurry.

06:35.731 --> 06:38.108
She look like the Loch Ness Monster.

06:38.192 --> 06:40.903
Might be Judy King.
Might be swamp gas.

06:40.986 --> 06:44.406
Yo, this is crap.

06:44.490 --> 06:46.075
Ain't y'all in her cooking class?

06:46.158 --> 06:49.036
Like, why didn't y'all get a picture
of her gettin' her cook on?

06:49.119 --> 06:52.289
I'm supposed to whip out
my contraband cell phone

06:52.372 --> 06:53.708
in the middle of the cafeteria?

06:54.291 --> 06:56.961
Look, bottom line,
we've got to get her alone,

06:57.044 --> 06:58.337
and we have to snap a candid.

06:58.420 --> 07:02.007
Hmm. Hey, this ain't so much worse
than that picture in <i>Us Weekly.</i>

07:02.091 --> 07:05.260
Yes, it is. And at least
that picture told a story.

07:05.344 --> 07:08.723
It was Judy King lending her green thumb
to help the poor inmates.

07:08.806 --> 07:10.307
That's the kind of picture
y'all need to get.

07:10.390 --> 07:11.476
And it's <i>U.S. Weekly.</i>

07:11.559 --> 07:13.352
You talkin' some white messiah bullshit.

07:13.436 --> 07:16.021
Yeah, because that's the kind
of bullshit that sells, boo-boo.

07:16.105 --> 07:19.567
Shots of her teaching someone...
how to read or some shit.

07:19.650 --> 07:21.360
I'll pretend I don't know how to read
if it make me famous.

07:21.444 --> 07:22.570
[scoffs] It's my camera.

07:22.653 --> 07:25.155
If anyone's gonna be
in the shot with Judy, it's me.

07:25.239 --> 07:28.283
Not me.
I know how to read.

07:28.367 --> 07:30.410
Whoa, I got an idea.

07:30.495 --> 07:33.581
How 'bout Abdullah wearing
a vest made of explosives

07:33.664 --> 07:36.959
and Judy the King
trying to defuse the bombs

07:37.042 --> 07:38.461
while I'm runnin' away.

07:38.544 --> 07:41.088
How about... I punch you in the face?

07:41.171 --> 07:43.257
I'm kiddin'. [groans]

07:43.340 --> 07:45.342
Where that famous Muslim sense of humor?

07:45.425 --> 07:46.469
-[snickers]
-[sighs]

07:46.552 --> 07:48.137
All right, we'll keep brainstorming.

07:48.220 --> 07:50.598
Just make sure she looks friendly,

07:50.681 --> 07:55.227
[in Southern accent] like the Judy King
America has grown to love.

07:55.310 --> 07:57.229
What time is it?

07:57.312 --> 07:59.023
Oh! It's late!

07:59.106 --> 08:02.442
Just take a picture
that tells a story, okay?

08:02.527 --> 08:04.403
-Now. In focus.
-[snapping fingers]

08:04.487 --> 08:06.280
Work on it.

08:06.363 --> 08:08.699
Ooh-whee! Yes, ma'am.

08:08.783 --> 08:10.951
Taystee all high siddity.

08:11.035 --> 08:13.370
She's gone mad
with slight empowerment.

08:14.246 --> 08:16.832
But I do like her new watch.

08:16.916 --> 08:18.584
-Very cool watch.
-That's a nice watch.

08:18.668 --> 08:20.419
[Suzanne] Mmm-hmm.

08:21.170 --> 08:22.838
[phone ringing]

08:24.507 --> 08:25.966
[clicks]

08:26.050 --> 08:28.218
Hey, babe.
I was just thinking about you.

08:28.302 --> 08:29.887
[Linda] <i>I was just thinking</i>
<i>about you, too.</i>

08:29.970 --> 08:32.181
And from thought to action, call Joe.

08:32.264 --> 08:34.517
<i>I almost drove over</i>
<i>to surprise you last night,</i>

08:34.600 --> 08:36.727
but I was too tired
to make the commute.

08:36.811 --> 08:37.852
<i>Next time tell me.</i>

08:37.937 --> 08:43.067
I'll meet you halfway.
There's a... 24-hour diner off Route 9...

08:43.984 --> 08:45.485
with a private bathroom.

08:45.570 --> 08:48.072
[laughing] You're joking, right?

08:48.573 --> 08:50.199
Hey, well...

08:50.282 --> 08:51.784
sure. [chuckling]

08:51.867 --> 08:53.744
You're joking. That's repulsive.

08:53.828 --> 08:55.663
<i>Um, listen, Joe.</i>

08:55.746 --> 08:57.665
I showed your education proposal to Jack.

08:58.332 --> 09:00.876
Yeah... and?

09:00.960 --> 09:02.336
He loves it.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.673
That's amazing!
Amazing!

09:05.756 --> 09:07.592
He had a few questions
about the course list,

09:07.675 --> 09:10.052
and he wanted to make
a few minor adjustments

09:10.135 --> 09:12.096
before sending it up the line.

09:12.179 --> 09:13.598
All right, well, what kind of adjustments?

09:13.681 --> 09:18.060
Well, the courses
that you were suggesting seemed, he felt,

09:18.143 --> 09:20.896
a little too weighted
towards the arts and humanities.

09:20.980 --> 09:23.608
Well, did you show him
the research on that?

09:23.691 --> 09:27.570
Those college-based initiatives
are shown to reduce recidivism.

09:27.653 --> 09:29.529
<i>Yes, I know, and we love that.</i>

09:29.614 --> 09:34.744
But... if we could balance that out
with some more vocational training,

09:34.827 --> 09:36.996
that would make more sense to the board.

09:37.079 --> 09:38.455
Huh.

09:38.538 --> 09:42.042
Joe, you don't get to be Orson Welles.
We have to meet them halfway.

09:42.126 --> 09:44.795
I'll meet them halfway
if you meet me halfway.

09:44.879 --> 09:46.589
Okay, sweetie, I don't...

09:47.506 --> 09:50.550
Enough about the bathroom. I don't...
I don't like it, okay?

09:50.635 --> 09:54.263
So, I will call you later tonight
when we hear back from the board.

09:54.346 --> 09:55.973
In person, I hope.

09:56.056 --> 09:58.433
[Linda] <i>We'll see how it goes.</i>
<i>You know I love a win.</i>

10:01.854 --> 10:03.648
[school bell ringing]

10:08.527 --> 10:10.946
Surprised you even stopped,
you son of a bitch.

10:11.030 --> 10:12.072
Keep your feet on the curb.

10:12.156 --> 10:13.407
[child] Oh.

10:13.490 --> 10:15.492
[inmates speaking indistinctly]

10:18.829 --> 10:20.580
Holy shit.
Hey, Chapman.

10:20.665 --> 10:22.625
-[laughs] Nikki!
-[Dixon] Hey.

10:22.708 --> 10:24.877
I flunked out of prison,
but they gave me a do-over.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.378
-[Dixon] Hey.
-[sighs] Uh, man.

10:26.461 --> 10:28.839
I mean, I'd give you a real hug but, uh,

10:28.923 --> 10:31.133
I guess it's already been
an "orgy of touching."

10:31.216 --> 10:32.927
Isn't that right, Officer Dixon?

10:33.010 --> 10:34.970
No more hugs.
You're maxed out.

10:35.054 --> 10:37.431
What about, uh, pussy licking?
Is that an option?

10:37.514 --> 10:39.266
Just to... get reacquainted.

10:39.349 --> 10:41.185
No? No.

10:41.268 --> 10:44.647
Judging by that look, I guess
pussy licking is also off the table.

10:44.730 --> 10:47.024
-[laughing]
-It's really good to see you.

10:47.107 --> 10:48.734
You too, Chapman.

10:48.818 --> 10:50.610
[Sankey clears throat]

10:51.528 --> 10:54.281
Sorry, this is Brandy, and this is...

10:54.364 --> 10:55.407
Sankey and...

10:55.490 --> 10:57.117
Skinhead Helen.

10:57.201 --> 10:59.411
Skinhead Helen, hi.
Nice tattoos.

11:00.454 --> 11:02.331
We're members of a community task force.

11:02.414 --> 11:04.124
They are a white power group.

11:04.208 --> 11:05.918
That's not true.
Not officially.

11:06.001 --> 11:07.044
But we're working on it.

11:07.127 --> 11:10.380
I don't think racism
should be a group activity.

11:10.464 --> 11:12.424
-It's private.
-Agree to disagree.

11:13.425 --> 11:14.593
A lot has happened since you left.

11:14.676 --> 11:16.470
Oh, yeah, I'm getting that.

11:16.553 --> 11:17.930
[Red gasps]

11:19.681 --> 11:21.058
[sighs]

11:21.934 --> 11:24.019
Okay. That's enough.

11:25.896 --> 11:27.356
I said break it up.

11:27.439 --> 11:29.108
Red, this guy's serious.

11:29.191 --> 11:31.318
I'll take the shot.

11:31.401 --> 11:34.446
Some things can't be rushed.

11:39.869 --> 11:40.953
[Piscatella] Hey.

11:41.036 --> 11:42.872
What do you think you're doing?

11:43.789 --> 11:45.082
Oh, no, it's the giant.

11:46.041 --> 11:49.795
If you run away from me,
you will regret it, inmate.

11:51.421 --> 11:54.216
Officers in proximity,
apprehend inmate Whitehill,

11:54.299 --> 11:57.094
approaching C-Yard like an antelope.

11:57.177 --> 11:59.764
And here is living area.

11:59.847 --> 12:02.850
The TV works,
but he likes it like that.

12:02.933 --> 12:04.351
I think his name is Randall.

12:04.434 --> 12:09.273
-Does someone come and clean at least?
-That is tenants' responsibility.

12:09.356 --> 12:11.733
Look, if you don't like it,
you don't have to be here.

12:11.817 --> 12:13.778
-Good...
-Oh, Lolly, come on, wait a minute.

12:13.861 --> 12:15.445
[Ann-Marie laughs]

12:15.529 --> 12:18.615
-I... I want to go stay with my mom.
-Your mom moved away, remember?

12:19.158 --> 12:20.284
She gave up the apartment.

12:20.367 --> 12:23.453
You can't go back there anymore
or they're gonna call the police.

12:24.038 --> 12:26.498
I'm sorry, babe,
but you can't come back to work either,

12:26.581 --> 12:28.458
and I don't...
I don't know what else to do with you.

12:28.542 --> 12:29.835
I can stay with you.

12:29.919 --> 12:32.754
I could take care of the baby.

12:35.049 --> 12:36.341
You think I'm crazy.

12:36.425 --> 12:38.552
I'm not crazy, Ann-Marie.

12:38.635 --> 12:40.762
I'm not crazy, either, Ann-Marie!

12:43.515 --> 12:45.935
You know what?
I'm gonna go talk to the guy

12:46.018 --> 12:48.645
and see if we can't get you a nicer room.

12:50.022 --> 12:52.066
What was that?
What... what was that look?

12:52.149 --> 12:54.443
-[whispers] Is that a signal?
-What? A signal?

12:54.526 --> 12:56.361
What does that mean,
"a nicer room"?

12:56.445 --> 12:58.572
I'll be right back.
Just, please, sit down.

13:02.910 --> 13:05.662
So... what'd you do?

13:05.745 --> 13:07.122
What?

13:07.206 --> 13:10.125
What did you do?
For them to put you here.

13:11.501 --> 13:13.337
They say it's 'cause I'm crazy.

13:15.047 --> 13:16.882
But really...

13:16.966 --> 13:18.467
it's because I'm a reporter,

13:18.550 --> 13:21.720
and I discovered a plot
that they would rather keep secret.

13:22.888 --> 13:26.308
The U.S. Government
is poisoning its own population

13:26.391 --> 13:28.602
as a pretext to declare martial law.

13:28.685 --> 13:31.605
And they've been trying to discredit me
ever since I found out the truth.

13:31.688 --> 13:33.983
That's typical. CIA?

13:34.066 --> 13:38.237
CIA, FBI, UPS, FEMA.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.197
I don't know how deep this thing goes.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.699
Well, the deeper you look,
the deeper it gets.

13:42.782 --> 13:45.452
Listen to me.
You can't stay here.

13:46.370 --> 13:48.413
You're too much of a target...

13:48.497 --> 13:50.249
and Randall gets violent.

13:50.332 --> 13:51.833
[sighs]

13:51.917 --> 13:54.086
-I don't think I have a choice.
-Of course you have a choice.

13:54.169 --> 13:57.006
You have free will.
They can't control your mind.

13:57.089 --> 13:58.548
Well...

13:58.632 --> 14:01.927
[stammers] At least until
the fluoride levels reach

14:02.011 --> 14:03.553
two milligrams per liter.

14:03.637 --> 14:06.640
But you're gonna need some help.

14:07.516 --> 14:09.184
See, here's what I'm gonna do.

14:09.268 --> 14:11.645
I'm gonna connect you to a friend of mine.
His name is Roy.

14:11.728 --> 14:14.689
He's an ally of the resistance,

14:14.773 --> 14:19.361
and he buys scrap metal
for 50 cents a pound.

14:19.444 --> 14:21.655
You get a shopping cart,

14:21.738 --> 14:24.449
start collecting cans
and other useful bits and pieces.

14:24.533 --> 14:27.411
You can make easy $20, $30 a day.

14:27.494 --> 14:30.830
Wait, you...
you want me to collect scrap metal?

14:31.748 --> 14:32.917
But I'm a journalist.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.793
Okay. This may be so,
but you cannot stay here.

14:34.877 --> 14:36.086
[whispers] This whole place is wired.

14:36.670 --> 14:40.257
-[whispers] What?
-And like I said, Randall gets violent.

14:40.925 --> 14:43.135
-[whispers] Is that Randall?
-No.

14:44.469 --> 14:45.595
I'm Randall.

14:45.679 --> 14:47.764
-You're Randall?
-Yeah.

14:49.766 --> 14:51.268
Excuse--
Excuse me for a second.

14:51.351 --> 14:52.644
Sure.

14:54.354 --> 14:57.399
-[grunting]
-Lolly! Lolly, where are you going?

14:57.482 --> 14:58.692
Lolly, stop!

15:00.903 --> 15:03.238
-[Yoga Jones] Hey, Judy.
-Hey.

15:03.322 --> 15:05.240
How was visitation?

15:05.324 --> 15:07.784
Oh, it was fine.

15:07.867 --> 15:09.744
It was nice to see Bill.

15:09.828 --> 15:11.997
Would've been better
if the husband hadn't come.

15:12.081 --> 15:13.207
On the same day?

15:13.290 --> 15:15.417
Reg can't drive, so Bill had to take him.

15:16.085 --> 15:18.087
And it's not awkward?

15:18.170 --> 15:20.297
You know what is awkward?

15:20.380 --> 15:23.675
Is havin' your past rise up
and bite you in the butt.

15:23.758 --> 15:27.972
Now, Bill has the good sense to lie to me
and tell me that everything is fine.

15:28.055 --> 15:32.351
Reg has this stupid need
to divulge everything.

15:32.434 --> 15:33.810
What's wrong?

15:33.893 --> 15:35.812
It's not even that big a deal.

15:35.895 --> 15:39.899
Somebody posted some old footage of me
from the '80s on YouTube.

15:39.984 --> 15:42.402
It's causing a little bit of a stink...

15:42.486 --> 15:43.988
internationally.

15:44.071 --> 15:45.155
Like a sex tape?

15:45.239 --> 15:47.324
No, no, that was already out there...

15:47.407 --> 15:49.743
and I looked really good.

15:49.826 --> 15:51.745
No, this was a puppet show.

15:51.828 --> 15:55.958
When I first started out,
I had my show on Charlotte Cable Access,

15:56.041 --> 15:59.003
and I thought it would be fun
to do a segment for the kids.

15:59.086 --> 16:00.712
Okay, what's wrong with that?

16:00.795 --> 16:02.506
Exactly, yes.

16:02.589 --> 16:05.384
I... I loved puppets growing up.

16:05.467 --> 16:08.345
My granddaddy was a performer
in Vaudeville,

16:08.428 --> 16:12.391
and so I wanted to do something
with that same spirit of fun.

16:12.474 --> 16:14.268
-Well, that sounds harmless.
-Mmm.

16:14.351 --> 16:17.146
So, I made up a character, Chitlin' Joe.

16:18.147 --> 16:19.273
Chitlin' Joe?

16:19.356 --> 16:22.151
And Watermelon Sam.
Well...

16:22.234 --> 16:25.320
Watermelon Sam was actually
a real watermelon. [chuckling]

16:25.404 --> 16:27.697
Joe was the hero of the show.

16:27.781 --> 16:29.992
He was a lovable old rascal.

16:30.075 --> 16:32.619
He was always trying to steal
the pies off my windowsill. [chuckling]

16:32.702 --> 16:35.039
[sighs] Okay.

16:35.122 --> 16:38.625
I have a sense of what the problem is.

16:38.708 --> 16:40.585
I am not prejudiced.

16:40.669 --> 16:44.381
I give substantial donations
to help inner city programs.

16:44.464 --> 16:47.676
You know, I have
countless black people in my employ,

16:47.759 --> 16:50.512
both at the farm, in my kitchens.

16:50.595 --> 16:53.723
Now, I think it's a crime
the way people take things out of context.

16:53.807 --> 16:57.561
Absolutely. Um...
[inhales sharply]

16:57.644 --> 17:01.690
I think it would be wise to continue
this discussion back in our room.

17:01.773 --> 17:02.982
But why?
What's happening?

17:03.067 --> 17:04.943
I don't know.
I just have a weird feeling.

17:05.027 --> 17:07.487
-All right, all right. Hang on.
-Mmm-hmm.

17:08.738 --> 17:09.739
[Black Cindy] Oh...

17:10.656 --> 17:12.451
I'm sorry, I thought you was alone.

17:12.534 --> 17:13.992
[scoffs] Suzanne,

17:14.078 --> 17:17.372
it's better if we get her when there's
no other white people around, remember?

17:17.455 --> 17:20.166
Oh, you don't think that they... heard?

17:20.250 --> 17:22.252
They think that I'm a...

17:22.336 --> 17:25.130
-No, it was just a puppet show.
-Let's go upstairs.

17:25.214 --> 17:26.381
[Judy] Oh, Lord.

17:26.464 --> 17:28.425
[speaking Spanish, laughs]

17:30.052 --> 17:33.263
What are you doing?
I thought you were studying for your GED.

17:33.347 --> 17:34.889
I studied enough to get the picture.

17:34.973 --> 17:36.850
What picture?

17:36.933 --> 17:39.228
The picture that
I'm getting out in two weeks

17:39.311 --> 17:42.147
and the processing alone
on that stupid test will be 12.

17:42.231 --> 17:43.273
There's no point.

17:43.357 --> 17:45.442
So, what?
You're gonna give up?

17:45.525 --> 17:47.486
Or you gonna go find yourself
a drug dealer to shack up with?

17:47.569 --> 17:49.446
'Cause that worked out
so well the first time.

17:49.529 --> 17:50.989
[sighs] Watch your mouth.

17:51.073 --> 17:54.618
Cesar put food on that table
and you had no problem eating it.

17:56.620 --> 18:00.165
Yeah, you know, I'm an idiot
for even feeling disappointed.

18:00.249 --> 18:03.418
Of course you can't get the kids back.
You don't even know how to try.

18:03.502 --> 18:04.794
Try what?

18:04.878 --> 18:06.796
How to pass their wack-ass tests?

18:07.797 --> 18:11.093
Passing their stupid tests
ain't gonna get the kids back, Daya!

18:11.176 --> 18:12.802
They want to see money!

18:13.970 --> 18:15.305
[sighs]

18:16.473 --> 18:19.684
They tell you to get the GED
like it's gonna change anything.

18:19.768 --> 18:22.146
How's a GED gonna make me not a felon?

18:22.229 --> 18:23.897
It shows you're making an effort.

18:23.980 --> 18:26.816
Yeah, and I go from unemployable
to unemployable with a pat on my back.

18:26.900 --> 18:31.613
The GED only exists to make me feel
like it's my fault when I fail,

18:31.696 --> 18:33.282
when the game is fucking rigged.

18:33.365 --> 18:35.659
Don't talk like that, man.
You a mean ruthless bitch.

18:35.742 --> 18:36.868
You gonna be just fine.

18:36.951 --> 18:38.620
-Yeah, totally.
-For sure.

18:39.454 --> 18:41.623
Only now, you gotta be legally ruthless.

18:41.706 --> 18:43.082
-How?
-[Maritza] I don't know.

18:43.167 --> 18:44.251
People do it all the time.

18:44.334 --> 18:46.628
Yeah, maybe school just isn't your thing.

18:46.711 --> 18:48.046
Steve Jobs didn't go to school.

18:48.130 --> 18:50.590
He didn't need to because
he knew all that computer shit.

18:50.674 --> 18:54.136
Or his friend did and he knew
how to sell his nerd friend.

18:54.219 --> 18:56.263
So think.

18:56.346 --> 18:57.972
What are you good at?

19:01.518 --> 19:02.769
Nothing.

19:05.104 --> 19:06.898
I never learned how to do shit.

19:11.236 --> 19:13.947
-Hey, you got any gear?
-No, bro.

19:14.030 --> 19:15.824
[mumbling]

19:15.907 --> 19:17.367
[Sankey] Come on, bring it to ten.

19:17.451 --> 19:19.828
Push it!
Are you a lion or a lamb?

19:19.911 --> 19:22.206
-[Helen] Lion!
-[all cheering]

19:22.289 --> 19:24.749
-Yeah, bring it to 12, ladies.
-[grunts]

19:24.833 --> 19:25.834
[Piper] That's right!

19:25.917 --> 19:27.419
Chapman!

19:29.963 --> 19:31.965
-[Sankey] You're a warrior!
-Hey.

19:33.258 --> 19:34.301
Oh.

19:34.384 --> 19:37.387
Your new friends are real keen
on physical fitness, huh?

19:37.471 --> 19:40.182
So that's good.
Real good people, they seem like.

19:40.265 --> 19:43.227
It's a temporary situation.
Things are a little bit hot right now.

19:43.310 --> 19:45.520
Oh, yeah, I heard all about it from Boo.

19:45.604 --> 19:47.522
What the fuck is wrong with you?

19:48.147 --> 19:49.649
You messed with Ruiz?

19:49.733 --> 19:52.486
I didn't have a choice.
She was moving in on my territory.

19:52.569 --> 19:53.820
Then don't have territory.

19:53.903 --> 19:56.155
What's that thing Yoga Jones talks about
when people come in?

19:56.240 --> 19:58.492
-You know, using your time as a sand maze.
-Mandala.

19:58.575 --> 20:00.202
-That's right, a mandala, okay?
-Yeah.

20:00.285 --> 20:04.248
So don't die for mandalas
of metaphorical sand.

20:04.331 --> 20:07.542
Unless you're that confident your
new friends here are gonna protect you.

20:07.626 --> 20:10.003
[Angie] I'm a white lion!
Like Aslan...

20:10.086 --> 20:11.713
[grunting]

20:11.796 --> 20:13.673
from <i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe!</i>

20:13.757 --> 20:16.134
-[all cheering]
-[laughing]

20:16.801 --> 20:19.304
I didn't mean for it to get this bad.

20:19.388 --> 20:20.972
But when you work so hard
to get something going

20:21.055 --> 20:23.141
and then somebody just tries
to snatch it away from you,

20:23.225 --> 20:25.769
what, am I just supposed to let her
get away with that?

20:25.852 --> 20:27.604
-Man...
-I had people depending on me.

20:27.687 --> 20:29.564
I have people depending on me for money.

20:29.648 --> 20:31.149
[chuckles] I get it, you know.

20:31.233 --> 20:34.778
I'm not exactly the poster child
of excellent life choices myself.

20:34.861 --> 20:36.154
I figured that she would get in trouble,

20:36.238 --> 20:38.657
but I did not think that
she was gonna get extra time.

20:38.740 --> 20:39.949
That has never happened before.

20:40.033 --> 20:41.910
How could I have known
that was gonna happen?

20:41.993 --> 20:43.912
All right.
Okay, just calm down, you know.

20:43.995 --> 20:45.997
I mean, just take a breath.

20:47.582 --> 20:49.584
[crying] I just want you to know
that this...

20:49.668 --> 20:51.461
that this isn't what it looks like.

20:51.545 --> 20:54.798
Of course not, but, uh, real talk.

20:54.881 --> 20:59.344
Sometimes, what it looks like
is all anybody can see.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.308
Anyway, um, I'll see you
at the party tomorrow.

21:06.310 --> 21:08.395
Um, what party?

21:08.478 --> 21:12.106
Oh, well, Lorna and Red are throwing me
that thing in the common room.

21:12.190 --> 21:13.692
Nobody told you about it?

21:15.026 --> 21:16.820
I'm sure they were going to.

21:25.329 --> 21:27.372
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

21:29.123 --> 21:30.584
[groans]

21:34.253 --> 21:35.672
[sniffling]

21:36.590 --> 21:39.258
What? Come on.

21:39.343 --> 21:40.552
[sighs]

21:45.682 --> 21:46.850
What?

21:46.933 --> 21:48.602
Hey there, Judy.
How you doin'?

21:48.685 --> 21:49.936
-Hey...
-[stutters]

21:50.019 --> 21:51.980
I'm Cindy.
I'm in your cooking class.

21:52.063 --> 21:55.149
Oh, uh... Uh, hey!
What do you want?

21:55.233 --> 21:57.026
Uh, nothing, you know.

21:57.110 --> 21:59.613
Um, I was thinking...

21:59.696 --> 22:01.490
would you mind
if I gave you a high five?

22:01.573 --> 22:03.617
Uh, no, but what for?

22:04.826 --> 22:08.037
You know, just for...
for being awesome.

22:08.622 --> 22:10.415
-Awesomeness.
-[chuckles] Okay.

22:10.499 --> 22:11.875
Like we're friends.
Come on, please?

22:11.958 --> 22:14.043
-Just a high five? All right?
-All right. Here we go.

22:14.127 --> 22:15.587
Up. Yeah!
[squeals]

22:15.670 --> 22:17.171
[Judy chuckles]

22:17.255 --> 22:18.673
[laughing] Yeah!

22:21.593 --> 22:22.636
Hmm.

22:22.719 --> 22:23.887
-Now, what's going on?
-Hmm?

22:23.970 --> 22:26.347
-What do you really want?
-Um, nothing.

22:26.431 --> 22:28.182
-But can I get one more high five?
-Oh, I--

22:28.266 --> 22:29.559
No, I need to go.

22:29.643 --> 22:31.102
[Black Cindy] Come on, Judy.
Just one more high five.

22:31.185 --> 22:32.186
-[Judy gasps]
-One more!

22:32.270 --> 22:35.273
Don't be cheap with the hand!
I ain't got no cooties or nothin'!

22:35.356 --> 22:37.150
Come on!
Just one more!

22:37.233 --> 22:39.444
-[Judy] No, no, no. No!
-Nah?

22:39.528 --> 22:42.489
I've caught her twice
rummaging through the garbage.

22:42.572 --> 22:47.952
And today I found her with
this piece of aluminized hose.

22:48.036 --> 22:49.454
-[Lolly sighs]
-Federal property.

22:49.538 --> 22:50.664
Yeah, I don't believe in property.

22:50.747 --> 22:53.833
Well, that's probably why
you're in prison.

22:53.917 --> 22:56.002
No, I've never been arrested for theft.

22:56.085 --> 22:58.505
Public vagrancy, disturbing the peace,

22:58.588 --> 23:01.925
-nudity, solicitation.
-[Healy sighs]

23:02.008 --> 23:05.929
Oh, what's that one that you use
when you really want to arrest somebody,

23:06.012 --> 23:07.972
but you have no reason to arrest them?

23:08.056 --> 23:10.266
Ah! Disorderly conduct.

23:10.349 --> 23:12.143
[clicks tongue] Got my high score
in that one, sir.

23:12.226 --> 23:14.438
What were you planning to do
with the hose, Lolly?

23:14.521 --> 23:15.772
What hose?

23:15.855 --> 23:17.857
This hose.

23:18.483 --> 23:21.027
I never seen that hose before in my life.

23:21.110 --> 23:22.278
And you know what?

23:22.361 --> 23:26.199
I'm not gonna talk to either one of you
until I get my lawyer present.

23:26.282 --> 23:28.868
There was a lady like her
on my block growing up.

23:28.952 --> 23:32.497
She had maggots in her ears
after clogging them with cheese

23:32.581 --> 23:34.082
trying to keep the voices out.

23:34.165 --> 23:37.461
Okay, that's insane.
You cannot block out voices with cheese.

23:37.544 --> 23:40.464
You know, I'll take care of her.

23:40.547 --> 23:42.924
She's actually been doing
a lot better lately.

23:44.175 --> 23:48.597
-This is just a bad day, right, Lolly?
-Just a bad day.

23:48.680 --> 23:51.725
Kinda like those bad days
that JFK and Kurt Cobain had

23:51.808 --> 23:54.018
when you people assassinated them.

23:54.644 --> 23:58.022
[inhales deeply] Keep a tighter leash
on your pet nut...

23:58.898 --> 24:00.734
or next time, I'm sending her to Psych.

24:00.817 --> 24:03.236
[woman speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

24:07.406 --> 24:08.575
[blowing raspberries]

24:08.658 --> 24:12.161
What's going on?
You were doing so well.

24:12.245 --> 24:14.163
It's not like I'm trying
to get in trouble.

24:15.081 --> 24:16.500
People are after me.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.292
What agency is it this time?

24:18.376 --> 24:21.963
Oh, it doesn't matter what agency.
They're all connected.

24:22.046 --> 24:25.424
Just because you don't see it,
doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.

24:25.509 --> 24:26.593
Right.

24:26.676 --> 24:27.802
[gasps]

24:27.886 --> 24:32.473
It's like those...
Magic Eye posters from the '90s...

24:32.557 --> 24:35.935
where at first you think it's just,
like, colored static.

24:37.436 --> 24:40.273
But if you look, and you focus...

24:40.356 --> 24:42.150
You've gotta have patience.

24:43.652 --> 24:45.153
Then you see a unicorn.

24:47.446 --> 24:49.533
[voice trembling] Or you'd see a dragon.

24:51.367 --> 24:54.412
I've seen a lot of dragons, Mr. Healy.

24:54.913 --> 24:56.164
And people are after you.

24:56.247 --> 24:58.499
Yeah, and they're not trying
to give me hugs.

24:58.583 --> 25:00.126
Where's the evidence?

25:01.294 --> 25:03.254
[voice breaking] I don't need no evidence.

25:03.337 --> 25:04.631
[sniffles]

25:04.714 --> 25:06.215
[sighs]

25:06.299 --> 25:08.593
My life is my evidence.

25:09.260 --> 25:11.054
[birds squawking]

25:12.889 --> 25:15.183
[Rocky] Lolly, got any coffee?

25:15.266 --> 25:18.227
[groaning] Comin'.

25:18.311 --> 25:19.353
[Rocky] Lolly?

25:19.437 --> 25:21.022
I'm comin'!

25:23.149 --> 25:24.859
-[grunts]
-[Rocky] I got a quarter.

25:26.027 --> 25:27.320
[sighing]

25:30.198 --> 25:31.240
[sniffling]

25:31.324 --> 25:33.284
-I got a quarter.
-Mmm-hmm.

25:33.367 --> 25:34.744
I got a quarter.

25:34.828 --> 25:37.496
Look, don't come knockin'
on my door when I'm asleep.

25:37.581 --> 25:39.165
You don't know,
maybe I have a gentlemen caller.

25:39.248 --> 25:40.249
You don't know.

25:40.333 --> 25:42.043
Uh, sorry.

25:43.044 --> 25:44.212
I didn't mean to bother you.

25:44.295 --> 25:46.089
No, no, no, no.
I'm, uh-- [sighs]

25:46.172 --> 25:47.841
I'm fixing to make coffee right now.

25:47.924 --> 25:49.718
No, I'm sorry I bothered you.
I'm sorry.

25:49.801 --> 25:51.427
I'm gonna make you some coffee.

26:04.608 --> 26:06.525
[cats meowing]

26:19.288 --> 26:21.415
[voices echoing] <i>Hairs in the water.</i>

26:21.499 --> 26:23.042
[laughing]

26:23.126 --> 26:25.378
[woman] <i>You can't filter out the poison.</i>

26:25.461 --> 26:28.256
[man] <i>It's all contaminated</i>
<i>with radiation, anyway.</i>

26:28.339 --> 26:29.799
[woman] <i>It's making you sick.</i>

26:29.883 --> 26:31.801
<i>-It's making everyone sick.</i>
-[jangling]

26:31.885 --> 26:33.511
[voices echoing]
<i>You're sick. Sick. You're sick.</i>

26:33.594 --> 26:37.348
-Yeah, yeah. I heard it all before.
-[droning rising]

26:37.431 --> 26:38.599
[droning stops]

26:40.351 --> 26:41.978
[birds chirping]

26:42.061 --> 26:43.688
[objects rattling]

26:56.034 --> 26:57.994
-Hey, Mac.
-Hey, Lolly.

26:58.077 --> 26:59.412
Want a cup of coffee?

26:59.913 --> 27:02.290
Uh, yeah, but, uh,
I don't have any money.

27:02.373 --> 27:03.667
Oh, that's okay.

27:03.750 --> 27:08.046
You just help me out if you see me
spinning too wide on my axis, all right?

27:08.129 --> 27:09.923
All right, deal.

27:14.052 --> 27:16.345
-Hey, James.
-How you doin'?

27:16.429 --> 27:17.806
Want a cup of coffee?

27:22.811 --> 27:24.270
[Lolly] Hi, little lady.

27:25.521 --> 27:27.190
[gasps] Ooh!

27:35.281 --> 27:37.366
-[indistinct chatter]
-Hi, guys.

27:41.412 --> 27:43.748
Yo! Thank you.

27:52.423 --> 27:54.008
[voices echoing]

27:55.551 --> 27:57.178
[jangling]

28:15.446 --> 28:16.655
[Lolly] Hey, Rocky.

28:16.740 --> 28:18.825
-[Rocky mumbling]
-Rocky! Where'd you go, man?

28:18.908 --> 28:21.369
I said I would make you coffee,
you just had to wait for it.

28:21.452 --> 28:24.163
-That's all.
-[mumbling]

28:24.247 --> 28:25.706
Rocky, what's the matter with you?

28:28.542 --> 28:30.378
[Lolly] Right on our place?

28:30.461 --> 28:31.921
No.

28:33.923 --> 28:35.383
Mr. Caputo?

28:35.466 --> 28:38.511
Mr. Caputo, it's about Judy King.

28:41.639 --> 28:44.392
Is this about
the ultra-offensive puppet show?

28:44.475 --> 28:46.019
So you know about that?

28:46.853 --> 28:49.898
Don't you think you should be taking
some special precautions?

28:49.981 --> 28:51.149
I'm not her babysitter.

28:51.232 --> 28:53.567
Yes. But aren't you?

28:54.944 --> 28:56.445
What do you want?

28:56.529 --> 28:58.656
She needs special protection.

28:58.740 --> 28:59.741
Fine.

29:00.992 --> 29:02.076
What else?

29:03.536 --> 29:04.746
What else?

29:04.829 --> 29:05.914
Yes.

29:07.248 --> 29:08.582
What else?

29:12.962 --> 29:13.963
What's the matter, Nichols?

29:14.047 --> 29:15.882
You hardly ate your mush
and your other mush.

29:15.965 --> 29:17.175
Ugh!

29:17.258 --> 29:19.427
Uh, I don't know.
I'm not so hungry.

29:19.510 --> 29:21.720
Maybe I picked up a bug down the hill.

29:21.805 --> 29:24.265
Or maybe you need some exercise.

29:24.348 --> 29:26.225
You should come with me to Custodial.

29:26.309 --> 29:28.895
We can take a little walk,
get the blood moving.

29:28.978 --> 29:31.022
No, thanks.

29:31.105 --> 29:32.440
I cleaned up enough shit

29:32.523 --> 29:35.026
swabbing the floors of the SHU
down in the pits of Mordor.

29:35.109 --> 29:37.195
Well, you're back in the Shire now.

29:37.278 --> 29:39.572
Too bad your main Hobbit
is off the market.

29:40.073 --> 29:41.115
Hey!

29:41.199 --> 29:43.492
-You mean it's true?
-[Big Boo] Mmm-hmm.

29:43.576 --> 29:45.244
You're actually married?

29:45.328 --> 29:47.288
-What, you thought I was lying?
-[Big Boo chuckles]

29:47.371 --> 29:49.207
[laughing] Yeah.

29:49.290 --> 29:51.500
I mean, obviously.
It's you.

29:51.584 --> 29:53.211
-Jesus.
-[chuckling]

29:53.294 --> 29:55.254
What am I gonna do for thrills?

29:55.338 --> 29:56.923
Well...

29:57.006 --> 29:59.675
<i>Playboy's</i> Vulcan of the month
is single again.

29:59.758 --> 30:01.677
-Not that she's screaming fun these days.
-[sighs]

30:01.760 --> 30:04.889
Okay, so let me get this straight.
So you're married, all right?

30:04.973 --> 30:06.557
Uh, Piper's a Nazi?

30:06.640 --> 30:07.683
Mmm-hmm.

30:07.766 --> 30:11.104
Boo has the BMI of a healthy human being.
Congratulations.

30:11.187 --> 30:13.356
[stutters] I feel like I'm in
an episode of <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

30:13.439 --> 30:15.399
Just give me something to hold on to.

30:15.483 --> 30:17.693
Tell you what...

30:17.776 --> 30:19.487
Hold onto this and spin.

30:19.570 --> 30:21.906
You know, I picked up
a parasite at the lake.

30:21.990 --> 30:25.076
Some tiny internal freeloader
who's, like, stealing my food.

30:25.159 --> 30:26.828
Just like Bette Midler!

30:26.911 --> 30:29.288
-Can I borrow him?
-Why?

30:29.372 --> 30:31.332
Tired of sticking your toothbrush
down your throat?

30:32.791 --> 30:34.543
I don't know what she's talking about.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.463
You know what?

30:37.546 --> 30:40.258
I think you should come
to Custodial with me.

30:40.341 --> 30:42.260
It's more fun than it sounds.

30:42.343 --> 30:43.761
And, actually,

30:43.845 --> 30:47.556
Warren and I have been doing
a little gumshoe detective work.

30:57.316 --> 30:58.734
Happy your girl's back?

30:58.817 --> 31:00.945
You don't realize there's
a piece of you missing

31:01.029 --> 31:04.740
until that piece comes back
and immediately pokes fun at your dye job.

31:06.659 --> 31:07.911
Aw!

31:09.412 --> 31:11.164
Does this look risen to you?

31:11.247 --> 31:13.749
No, because you keep opening
the oven and letting the heat out.

31:13.832 --> 31:17.086
I like to check on my food.
That's when I put the love in.

31:17.170 --> 31:20.339
There's no love in baking.
It's about following instructions...

31:20.423 --> 31:22.633
resisting the urge to poke.

31:22.716 --> 31:24.510
-It's an exercise in trust.
-Hmm.

31:24.593 --> 31:27.055
Trust is not my strong suit.

31:28.056 --> 31:29.348
Hey, Red.

31:35.980 --> 31:39.192
I need you to start sending meals
up to Judy King's room.

31:39.275 --> 31:41.735
Why? She's too good
to eat with the rest of us?

31:41.819 --> 31:45.156
I don't have time to explain.
It's for her own protection.

31:45.239 --> 31:46.865
Now I have to know.

31:46.950 --> 31:49.285
Just send the meals up,
and make 'em tasty.

31:49.368 --> 31:51.955
You're getting special use
of the common room tonight.

31:52.038 --> 31:53.789
That's a privilege not given lightly.

31:53.872 --> 31:58.002
Oh, I didn't know you kept tabs
on the day-to-day anymore.

31:58.086 --> 32:00.629
I thought you were up in some ivory tower.

32:00.713 --> 32:02.798
There's a good view from that tower.

32:05.801 --> 32:07.095
Are you fucking kidding me?

32:07.178 --> 32:09.430
When Burset needed protection,
they sent her to the SHU.

32:09.513 --> 32:12.100
And now Judy King gets special meals.

32:12.934 --> 32:14.102
Where those eye drops at?

32:14.768 --> 32:16.229
No, it's not worth it.

32:16.312 --> 32:17.896
Not today.

32:17.981 --> 32:19.023
Oh!

32:19.107 --> 32:23.069
Looking at this sad,
deflated cake hurts my soul.

32:23.152 --> 32:24.778
I'll get more powdered eggs.

32:24.862 --> 32:25.863
Thank you.

32:25.947 --> 32:28.032
You remember when we had real eggs?

32:28.116 --> 32:30.326
Remember when you wasted them
doing your magic?

32:30.409 --> 32:32.245
I thought it was a good idea at the time.

32:32.328 --> 32:37.291
Judging by the wizened, gnarled,
unique quality of the poop,

32:37.375 --> 32:39.502
we know it's not a copy-cat pooper.

32:39.585 --> 32:41.379
That leaves us with two suspects.

32:41.462 --> 32:44.173
Number one, Warren's ex-girlfriend.

32:44.257 --> 32:47.426
You know, the girl with
the Cabbage Patch doll face

32:47.510 --> 32:50.138
and the name,
it sounds like a Phil Collins song?

32:50.679 --> 32:53.099
-Kukudio?
-Correct!

32:53.182 --> 32:57.603
Now, she has a motive,
but she also has a rock solid alibi.

32:57.686 --> 33:00.773
She was at work
at the time of the incidents.

33:00.856 --> 33:03.276
Brings us to our second suspect, Angie.

33:03.359 --> 33:04.777
Angie Rice, the meth head?

33:04.860 --> 33:06.862
-Correct.
-Uh-huh.

33:06.945 --> 33:10.783
Witnesses have confirmed her
at the scene of the crime

33:10.866 --> 33:13.202
at least two out of three incidences.

33:13.286 --> 33:14.870
Okay, well...

33:14.953 --> 33:16.580
uh, it's her.

33:16.664 --> 33:18.249
Case closed.

33:18.332 --> 33:20.376
I mean, sure, she's a degenerate,

33:20.459 --> 33:23.712
but is that really motive enough
for such a heinous act?

33:23.796 --> 33:26.340
Okay, you don't understand.
The motive is drugs.

33:26.424 --> 33:28.426
She's moving drugs down
the Hershey highway. Check it out.

33:28.509 --> 33:30.969
All right, she's probably got some guy
that she's meeting at visitation,

33:31.054 --> 33:32.846
and he kisses her all long and passionate,

33:32.930 --> 33:34.473
but then instead of
slipping her the tongue,

33:34.557 --> 33:36.350
he's slipping her a packet, see?

33:36.434 --> 33:39.937
And she has to swallow it because
of the post-visitation strip-search

33:40.021 --> 33:42.440
and double-ended "Say 'Ah's."

33:42.523 --> 33:45.651
So, she goes and she poops it
in the shower

33:45.734 --> 33:50.448
where it's easier to pull the goodies
out of the fuckin' Cracker Jack box,

33:50.531 --> 33:52.908
'cause you don't want your shit
getting lost in the toilet bowl.

33:52.991 --> 33:54.410
A tale as old as time.

33:55.036 --> 33:56.620
Oh, my God.

33:57.705 --> 34:00.291
You just cracked the case.

34:00.374 --> 34:01.542
Just like that.

34:01.625 --> 34:03.211
To understand a degenerate,

34:03.294 --> 34:06.422
you have to enter the mind
of a degenerate.

34:06.505 --> 34:09.175
Fortunately, I have years of experience.

34:10.176 --> 34:13.429
It is so, so good to have you back.

34:14.222 --> 34:15.931
[woman speaking indistinctly on TV]

34:19.476 --> 34:21.728
So, you got the picture?

34:22.980 --> 34:25.399
[chuckles] Come into the circle.

34:31.697 --> 34:33.366
[Taystee] What is this?

34:33.449 --> 34:35.534
You look like you about to kill the bitch.

34:35.618 --> 34:39.330
Yes, but on the positive,
excellent focus, excellent resolution.

34:39.413 --> 34:40.664
Thank you, thank you.

34:40.748 --> 34:43.417
And, and it tells a story.

34:43.501 --> 34:46.043
[sighs]
You really want a picture out there

34:46.129 --> 34:48.589
that looks like you
about to beat down Judy King?

34:48.672 --> 34:52.009
I mean, you're right, it probably would
make my mama cry.

34:52.092 --> 34:54.678
But if it ends up in a magazine,
I'm cool with it.

34:54.762 --> 34:56.139
[news anchor] <i>Judy King,</i>
<i>already serving time...</i>

34:56.222 --> 34:58.891
[gasps] Check it out, puppets!

34:58.974 --> 35:02.019
<i>Footage surfaced on YouTube</i>

[Chitlin' Joe]
<i>It was Watermelon Sam who took it.</i>

35:17.410 --> 35:19.120

35:19.203 --> 35:22.039
<i>No, he took the pie, he ate your pie,</i>

35:22.123 --> 35:24.417

<i>Whoo-whee!</i>

35:27.085 --> 35:29.922

-[clicks tongue] Mmm-mmm. Mmm.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.051
<i>In facts, I did him a favor.</i>

35:34.135 --> 35:37.305

<i>He always did wanna live</i>
<i>on the nice part of town.</i>

35:40.516 --> 35:43.311
I don't think I like this puppet show.

35:43.394 --> 35:47.523
You know, I think my mom would totally
be fine seeing me beat down Judy King.

35:47.606 --> 35:49.358
Okay...

35:49.442 --> 35:51.694
maybe we are telling the right story.

35:51.777 --> 35:54.655
Whoops!
I'm out of juice.

35:55.739 --> 35:57.866
Y'all know anyone around here
with a charger?

35:58.617 --> 35:59.827
[knocking on door]

36:03.164 --> 36:04.165
Is it official?

36:04.248 --> 36:07.000
-I don't buy sparkling wine for losers.
-Yes!

36:07.084 --> 36:11.505
Your education initiative was approved
by the board nine-to-one.

36:11.589 --> 36:14.007
<i>♪ This is how we do what we do ♪</i>

36:14.091 --> 36:16.219
-This is incredible.
-[chuckles]

36:16.302 --> 36:18.221
You are incredible.

36:19.680 --> 36:21.682
You are the one that made it happen.

36:23.226 --> 36:24.852
-Is this it?
-Mmm-hmm.

36:24.935 --> 36:26.187
Look, it even has
your name on it. [chuckles]

36:26.270 --> 36:27.813
I thought you'd get a kick out of that.

36:27.896 --> 36:31.024
You are the first person
in the history of this company

36:31.108 --> 36:33.777
who has managed to sell education
as a means of control.

36:33.861 --> 36:35.529
-Glasses?
-In the cabinet.

36:35.613 --> 36:37.448
It's not just a means of control.

36:37.531 --> 36:41.494
If you don't invest in education now,
you end up paying for it in the long run.

36:41.577 --> 36:42.578
Absolutely.

36:42.661 --> 36:45.873
-[sighs] Is this the course catalog?
-Mmm-hmm.

36:49.001 --> 36:50.586
[Caputo chuckles]

36:50.669 --> 36:53.005
Where's the math and science and...

36:53.088 --> 36:56.133
Oh, um... uh, we switched it out
with basic carpentry and plumbing.

36:56.217 --> 36:58.844
We agreed on more vocational classes,
remember?

37:00.679 --> 37:03.516
[stutters] But you took out
every core class.

37:03.599 --> 37:04.683
[cork pops]

37:05.643 --> 37:08.521
There's no English,
there's no History, there...

37:09.355 --> 37:11.482
There's not even an arts class. I...

37:13.066 --> 37:15.944
"Concrete 101"?

37:16.028 --> 37:18.864
"Foundation Pouring"?
What is that?

37:18.947 --> 37:21.284
None of this is in my original proposal.

37:21.367 --> 37:23.994
Well, I told you that there would be
some adjustments.

37:24.077 --> 37:25.913
It's all construction.

37:29.625 --> 37:30.793
It's a chain gang.

37:30.876 --> 37:34.255
No. No, it is a school, technically.

37:34.338 --> 37:37.258
We need to emphasize
the school part, otherwise...

37:37.341 --> 37:40.344
we have to pay them their 11 cents
an hour. Right? [chuckling]

37:41.387 --> 37:42.471
Joe.

37:43.347 --> 37:45.558
Hey, I know this isn't exactly
what you envisioned,

37:45.641 --> 37:48.811
but it's a victory to get
any project off the ground.

37:48.894 --> 37:52.022
You shoot for the moon,
you land somewhere in the stars, right?

37:53.566 --> 37:54.567
[sighs]

37:54.650 --> 37:56.360
<i>Kippis!</i>

37:56.444 --> 37:59.280
That's "cheers" in Finnish.
Isn't that fun to say out of your mouth?

37:59.363 --> 38:01.073
Timo Lindman on the board is Finnish.

38:06.287 --> 38:09.122
[Nicky] This is amazing.
Thank you.

38:09.206 --> 38:10.708
I can't take all the credit.

38:11.417 --> 38:13.336
Mendoza helped a little.

38:13.419 --> 38:14.795
I would have made more of a spread,

38:14.878 --> 38:17.881
but they have me up at
3:30 in the morning these days.

38:17.965 --> 38:20.593
[Nicky] Yikes!
Well, maybe you should go to bed.

38:20.676 --> 38:22.345
I don't understand
how you're still upright.

38:22.428 --> 38:24.305
I'm Russian.

38:24.388 --> 38:26.307
And back in Russia, where I come from,

38:26.390 --> 38:28.976
when we see a friend
we haven't seen for a long time,

38:29.059 --> 38:32.187
we make them eat and drink
until they can't move.

38:32.270 --> 38:36.191
You better get ready to eat
a whole cake yourself.

38:36.274 --> 38:39.027
In a bit, all right?
I'm sorry, I'm just not hungry yet.

38:39.111 --> 38:40.654
All right.

38:40.738 --> 38:42.781
Maybe some music, huh?
Gina?

38:42.865 --> 38:45.409
[Gina] Uh, yeah, I need a minute.

38:45.493 --> 38:47.202
[Red] I thought you said
you tested that thing!

38:47.285 --> 38:49.204
I... I did.
It worked an hour ago.

38:49.287 --> 38:50.873
[Lorna] Yeah, turn up the music.
[Big Boo] Music?

38:50.956 --> 38:52.165
Heck, yeah!

38:52.249 --> 38:54.335
Come on, Gina,
I got my dancing shoes on.

38:54.418 --> 38:57.630
I can help. Look, I, you know,
build my own custom guitar pedals,

38:57.713 --> 38:59.131
so I love a project like this.

38:59.214 --> 39:01.174
Look, I don't need your help,
I know what I'm doing.

39:01.258 --> 39:03.636
Yeah, but it's not working,
so let me just help you out a little bit.

39:03.719 --> 39:05.303
-Did you plug it in?
-Yes, Grandma, I plugged it in.

39:05.388 --> 39:07.305
Will you guys just... give me some space.

39:07.390 --> 39:10.518
Just started in electrical and she thinks
she can make a homemade speaker.

39:43.091 --> 39:44.301
This is great.

39:45.636 --> 39:47.721
Getting out,
being part of the community.

39:47.805 --> 39:50.433
No, no, I shouldn't be here.
Nobody wants me here.

39:50.516 --> 39:53.185
Will you stop that?
That's not true.

39:53.268 --> 39:56.146

Hey, sweetie, can you give me
a hand for a second?

I don't have any money, sorry.

41:09.302 --> 41:11.388
I didn't ask you for any money.

Hey, there, how's it going?
You know it's illegal to panhandle here?

41:18.436 --> 41:20.272
I'm not panhandling.

41:20.355 --> 41:21.732
I sell coffee.

41:21.815 --> 41:23.651
Yeah, and do you have a license for that?

41:23.734 --> 41:25.944
It's not, like, a serious business, okay?

41:26.028 --> 41:27.571
I live in this neighborhood.

I used to stay over in that big lot
next to Thomas Street.

You're gonna have to move along.

42:40.603 --> 42:42.980
This is how the other half lives?

42:43.063 --> 42:44.732
Oh, is that supper?

42:44.815 --> 42:47.359
Thank goodness, I thought you all
had forgotten about me up here.

42:47.442 --> 42:52.740
Sorry, I got lost in the woods
on my way to your magical pleasure dome.

42:54.825 --> 42:56.952
I'm surprised you ain't got
your own private chef.

42:58.120 --> 43:01.206
You already got your own
private yoga instructor.

43:01.289 --> 43:02.750
Or is she your food taster?

43:02.833 --> 43:04.960
It's not that wonderful.

43:05.043 --> 43:07.671
We're very isolated up here.

43:07.755 --> 43:09.339
Is that homemade seltzer?

43:10.257 --> 43:11.299
Maybe.

43:11.383 --> 43:13.761
What exactly is going on here?

43:14.762 --> 43:17.222
How come you have your own
special meals being delivered?

43:17.305 --> 43:18.724
[sighs] That is a long story.

43:18.807 --> 43:22.185
And I would much rather talk
about your gorgeous nails.

43:22.269 --> 43:23.436
May I?

43:24.605 --> 43:27.691
Well, I love those.
Now, who did 'em for ya?

43:27.775 --> 43:30.485
Nobody. I do 'em myself.
Always have.

43:30.568 --> 43:32.112
Well, you obviously know
what you are doing.

43:32.195 --> 43:34.322
Those contrast tips are perfect.

43:35.407 --> 43:36.408
Here you go.

43:36.491 --> 43:38.118
-What's this?
-Stamps.

43:38.201 --> 43:39.369
A tip.

43:39.452 --> 43:41.079
I was told they're used as currency.

43:43.081 --> 43:45.083
Can I have some of them cookies, too?

43:46.877 --> 43:49.713
Well, sure.
Uh, please, help yourself. [chuckles]

43:50.588 --> 43:52.215
This is all right with you, isn't it?
I mean...

43:52.299 --> 43:54.635
you're not really into
material stuff, right?

43:58.513 --> 44:00.557
Of course not.
Go ahead.

44:04.311 --> 44:06.229
How much would you pay
for nails like these?

44:06.855 --> 44:09.316
-On the outside.
-Oh, a nice job like that?

44:09.399 --> 44:13.486
Well... 25, 30.
Forty or 50 for gels.

44:14.029 --> 44:15.447
Even more for acrylics.

44:16.281 --> 44:18.283
That's about the price I figured.

44:18.366 --> 44:20.202
I just wanted to double check.

44:21.745 --> 44:24.331
I'm gonna start my own business
when I get out. A nail business.

44:24.414 --> 44:25.623
A salon?

44:26.291 --> 44:28.501
Yeah, a salon.

44:28.585 --> 44:30.628
-Huh.
-A nail salon.

44:34.632 --> 44:37.052
Why do we have a seltzer machine?

44:37.761 --> 44:40.472
I told Caputo you needed one.

44:40.555 --> 44:41.682
Didn't you say that?

44:41.765 --> 44:43.516
No, I don't think so.

44:44.184 --> 44:46.061
Funny. I thought you did.

44:49.522 --> 44:51.691
Yo, Chapman,
what're you doing walking alone?

44:52.860 --> 44:54.194
Just heading to the common room.
It's all right.

44:54.277 --> 44:55.403
There'll be lots of people there.

44:55.487 --> 44:56.529
Still, apes swing.

44:56.613 --> 44:59.574
I wanted to talk to you about
maybe expanding our turf.

45:00.575 --> 45:01.827
"Our turf"?

45:01.910 --> 45:05.038
Yeah, I mean, it's not fair the Dominicans
get the shaded area in the yard.

45:05.122 --> 45:06.414
We're the ones low in melanin.

45:06.498 --> 45:08.792
I thought the whole point of our things
was to break up gangs.

45:08.876 --> 45:10.502
If we're talking about turf,
we're a gang,

45:10.585 --> 45:12.963
you're a gang,
we're all gangbangers.

45:13.046 --> 45:14.214
Whatever.

45:14.297 --> 45:17.300
The task force was a good start,
but it's time to up our game.

45:17.384 --> 45:19.887
You gotta do what you gotta do
to survive in this motherfucker.

45:19.970 --> 45:22.014
You might be right...

45:22.097 --> 45:25.058
but I also need to survive with myself
when I get out of here.

45:25.142 --> 45:26.726
What does that mean?

45:26.810 --> 45:29.772
Do you ever think that
by demonizing large groups of people,

45:29.855 --> 45:32.482
we're actually making this place
more dangerous?

45:32.565 --> 45:34.026
-We're sisters.
-Hmm.

45:34.109 --> 45:36.653
We have to look out for each other.
This place is dangerous.

45:37.737 --> 45:39.072
I'll see you later.

45:43.201 --> 45:44.494
Disrespect.

45:44.577 --> 45:48.290
Nah, she doesn't know what she's saying.
It's the white shame again.

45:48.373 --> 45:50.292
I wish she could learn to love herself.

45:50.375 --> 45:53.378
I don't know, must be a loose wire
or something.

45:53.461 --> 45:55.338
I don't need gloves, it's totally safe.

45:57.966 --> 45:59.259
That was a fluke, Norma.

45:59.342 --> 46:02.762
Look, I... I can't live my life in fear.
Don't impose it on me.

46:02.846 --> 46:04.639
[music playing]

46:04.722 --> 46:06.058
[inmates cheering]

46:09.227 --> 46:10.979
Oh, no, what're they doing here?

46:11.814 --> 46:13.440
It's the common room.

46:13.523 --> 46:15.275
Now, you can't keep out the commoners.

46:15.358 --> 46:17.735
Well, we don't have to give 'em cake.

46:17.820 --> 46:19.487
Dirty shower pooper.

46:20.072 --> 46:23.616
Nicky, I heard you worked
cleaning cells in Max.

46:23.700 --> 46:25.243
Any chance you saw Sophia?

46:26.078 --> 46:27.787
Yeah, I saw her.

46:27.871 --> 46:29.539
Yeah, and?

46:30.290 --> 46:31.666
And I don't know
what to say, all right?

46:31.749 --> 46:34.794
There was a shitload of blood.
They had to take her to medical.

46:34.878 --> 46:36.004
Oh, my God.

46:36.588 --> 46:39.925
Look, sometimes people feel like fighting,
so they punch the walls.

46:40.008 --> 46:42.344
That would be the best case scenario,
based on what I saw.

46:43.553 --> 46:44.847
She might've cut herself.

46:47.432 --> 46:49.559
Okay, come on.
Come dance with me.

46:49.642 --> 46:52.270
Just give me one second, all right?
I'll be right back.

46:54.231 --> 46:55.273
Best case?

46:55.357 --> 46:57.943
Crystal has to know what's happening.

46:58.610 --> 46:59.694
[Nicky] Hey!

47:06.368 --> 47:07.494
Whitehill.

47:08.495 --> 47:09.746
Lolly.

47:11.789 --> 47:12.916
Lolly.

47:16.169 --> 47:18.088
Did you see that?

47:18.171 --> 47:20.507
Lolly's acting really weird.

47:20.590 --> 47:24.261
The weirder she acts,
the less anyone takes her seriously.

47:25.053 --> 47:28.306
-I'm with my family tonight.
-[sighs]

47:28.390 --> 47:29.641
All right.

47:30.308 --> 47:32.227
Out of sight, out of mind, right?

47:32.310 --> 47:33.853
Exactly.

47:41.528 --> 47:42.946
[Nicky speaking indistinctly]

47:54.249 --> 47:55.542
[sniffs]

48:06.136 --> 48:08.388
Oh, wow, this is great.

48:09.139 --> 48:10.598
Does Piscatella know about this?

48:11.308 --> 48:13.851
-Why, you gonna rat us all out?
-No.

48:13.936 --> 48:17.189
Here you go, my dear.
Grape Kool-Aid.

48:17.272 --> 48:20.567
Uh-huh. Is there any alcohol in that?

48:20.650 --> 48:21.818
Would you like a taste test?

48:21.901 --> 48:24.862
Or will the task force be by later
to take a urine sample?

48:24.947 --> 48:27.324
I'm not the enemy, Boo.

48:27.407 --> 48:28.533
I'm your friend.

48:28.616 --> 48:31.119
Oh, Labor and Capital can never
really be friends.

48:31.203 --> 48:33.246
More like fuck buddies.

48:33.956 --> 48:35.165
Let's go.

48:38.335 --> 48:39.461
[chuckles]

48:42.505 --> 48:45.467
-Hey, Vause.
-Hey. Um...

48:45.550 --> 48:46.843
Sorry, I'm leaving.

48:46.926 --> 48:48.928
-That's cool. I'll just...
-Yeah.

48:49.012 --> 48:50.555
...party by myself.

48:59.147 --> 49:00.315
Lolly.

49:02.067 --> 49:04.152
I know you're down here.

49:04.236 --> 49:05.487
I saw you come down.

49:05.570 --> 49:07.155
[Lolly] I'm over here.

49:07.239 --> 49:08.615
[faint knock]

49:08.698 --> 49:10.450
In the time machine.

49:16.373 --> 49:18.125
Well, it's a work-in-progress.

49:18.208 --> 49:20.960
I'm still experimenting
with the power source.

49:21.794 --> 49:24.756
So this is why you've
been collecting materials.

49:24.839 --> 49:27.717
So you see now why
I kept it secret from you, right?

49:27.800 --> 49:29.511
I didn't want you implicated.

49:30.720 --> 49:32.472
'Cause then you would be a target, too.

49:34.057 --> 49:35.808
I mean, unless you still don't think

49:35.892 --> 49:39.437
that I'm important enough to be
a target of an international conspiracy.

49:40.313 --> 49:41.648
Move over.

49:50.573 --> 49:52.659
[sighs] Okay.

49:54.702 --> 49:58.831
Let's assume for a second
that there is a conspiracy against you.

49:59.916 --> 50:01.293
Why go back in time?

50:01.376 --> 50:03.628
Because, if I can go back in time,

50:03.711 --> 50:05.797
I can stop Jimmy Carter
from starting FEMA.

50:07.257 --> 50:08.716
Lolly...

50:09.634 --> 50:13.638
everyone wants
to go back in time sometimes.

50:14.806 --> 50:20.187
To go back to the moment
when everything was still possible,

50:20.270 --> 50:23.690
before they made a wrong turn,
so that they could go on the right path.

50:23.773 --> 50:25.608
But it's not possible.

50:26.943 --> 50:32.240
All we can do is
make the most of right now.

50:33.325 --> 50:35.160
Okay, I tried that.

50:36.578 --> 50:39.914
[stuttering] But traveling back in time
just seemed more,

50:39.997 --> 50:42.084
you know, feasible.

50:44.377 --> 50:47.339
I don't have no moment
when everything went wrong.

50:49.466 --> 50:52.844
Unless it was that moment I was born
with that sickness in me.

50:53.553 --> 50:55.472
[sighs] You're probably right.

50:56.139 --> 50:58.308
[sighs deeply]

50:58.391 --> 50:59.934
I was just probably desperate.

51:00.935 --> 51:02.479
[sniffles]

51:06.274 --> 51:09.068
Man, this sounded better
when we talked about it earlier.

51:09.819 --> 51:11.654
When we talked about it?

51:11.738 --> 51:13.490
[laughing]

51:13.573 --> 51:15.200
-Okay, me and the...
-Oh.

51:15.283 --> 51:16.826
[both laughing]

51:18.453 --> 51:20.413
Hey, I know they're not real,

51:20.497 --> 51:22.665
but it don't mean that
they don't have nothing to say.

51:24.501 --> 51:28.045
[sighs]
Sometimes that shit is scary.

51:28.588 --> 51:31.007
Especially when that
little girl starts whispering.

51:32.967 --> 51:34.802
Okay, but sometimes...

51:36.012 --> 51:38.348
you know, they make these
convincing arguments.

51:38.431 --> 51:42.769
So, if they think that it's plausible

51:42.852 --> 51:46.481
that we could go back in time
and save America...

51:46.564 --> 51:48.024
then I gotta honor that.

51:49.066 --> 51:53.780
Plus, I read this romance novel,
and it was about time travel,

51:53.863 --> 51:55.990
and I really dug the science of that.

51:58.660 --> 52:00.620
Plus, I got that potato.

52:08.002 --> 52:09.421
[whispering] Mr. Healy?

52:09.504 --> 52:10.797
Hmm?

52:12.006 --> 52:14.050
Are you travelin' in time?

52:14.133 --> 52:16.261
No. No, I was just, uh...

52:19.639 --> 52:22.309
I spent a lot of time
in boxes as a kid.

52:23.726 --> 52:26.062
They were forts, really.

52:27.146 --> 52:28.648
Forts.

52:29.566 --> 52:31.901
You could stay down here
as long as you want.

52:32.652 --> 52:34.196
Maybe a few more minutes.

52:36.364 --> 52:37.782
Then we'll go.

52:39.326 --> 52:41.035
[softly] Okay.

52:42.078 --> 52:43.788
Okay.

52:46.791 --> 52:49.502
What I don't understand is,
I step up to the plate for everybody.

52:49.586 --> 52:51.463
It's not like I want credit.

52:53.172 --> 52:55.174
But I take care of business.

52:56.092 --> 52:58.470
And suddenly, everybody's acting
like I'm some kind of a monster.

52:58.553 --> 53:01.306
I'm sorry, I really need
to focus on DJing.

53:01.389 --> 53:04.851
Aren't you just playing
a playlist off your iPod?

53:06.228 --> 53:08.771
How do you even have an iPod?

53:08.855 --> 53:09.856
[Hapakuka] Hey, Chapman.

53:11.983 --> 53:12.984
Hey.

53:13.067 --> 53:15.445
Where are your new friends?

53:15.528 --> 53:17.697
It's not really working out.

53:19.574 --> 53:20.867
You're not scared of Maria?

53:20.950 --> 53:23.911
No, I'm scared, but I'm pretending
that this Kool-Aid has alcohol in it,

53:23.995 --> 53:25.247
and that kinda helps.

53:28.291 --> 53:29.876
I owe you an apology.

53:32.169 --> 53:34.589
I have not been cool to you
since you got here.

53:34.672 --> 53:37.300
-No, you haven't.
-I'm wondering...

53:38.760 --> 53:40.928
may I please have a do-over?

53:41.846 --> 53:43.723
I don't know.

53:43.806 --> 53:46.559
I... I've been thinking about it, but...

53:46.643 --> 53:47.977
the thing is... [stammers]

53:48.811 --> 53:52.440
I'm sorry, uh, can we talk outside?
It's a little loud.

53:52.524 --> 53:53.733
Sure.

53:53.816 --> 53:55.402
-Yeah.
-Sure.

53:59.781 --> 54:01.991
The thing is, Chapman...

54:03.826 --> 54:06.413
I was turned off by you
the moment I met you.

54:06.996 --> 54:12.084
But I was alone and scared,
so I made an alliance with you, and...

54:13.044 --> 54:14.879
I mean,
you didn't even respect that alliance.

54:14.962 --> 54:16.005
I know.

54:16.923 --> 54:21.218
And I have no excuse
except that I was scared, too.

54:22.345 --> 54:23.471
Yeah.

54:25.264 --> 54:29.101
But I get it now,
and actually, you were right.

54:29.185 --> 54:31.270
I was right about what?

54:31.938 --> 54:34.190
Right about being pragmatic.

54:35.149 --> 54:37.694
You gotta do what you gotta do.

54:37.777 --> 54:38.945
[Piper gasps]

54:40.488 --> 54:42.990
I'm sorry I can't help you...

54:43.074 --> 54:45.076
but I'm rooting for you, too.

54:45.159 --> 54:46.828
[muffled screaming]

54:46.911 --> 54:48.621
[all straining]

54:49.539 --> 54:51.666
-[Blanca] Come on.
-[muffled grunting]

54:53.084 --> 54:54.210
[screams]

54:56.546 --> 54:57.880
[screaming]

54:57.964 --> 54:59.549
-[shushing]
-[groaning]

55:02.427 --> 55:04.136
[pop music playing]

55:16.483 --> 55:18.025
[crying]

55:19.026 --> 55:23.280
When you're in a gang,
you get this label put on you.

55:23.365 --> 55:24.532
And thanks to what you pulled,

55:24.616 --> 55:29.829
I've been marked by Admin
as this big, bad gang girl, you see?

55:29.912 --> 55:31.288
So I'm done.

55:33.124 --> 55:34.626
But I've been thinking.

55:36.293 --> 55:38.129
You gangster, too, Chapman.

55:38.212 --> 55:40.465
Oh, you're hella gangster, right?

55:40.548 --> 55:44.093
-[Piper wailing]
-So where's your label, huh?

55:46.804 --> 55:48.640
[pop music continues]

55:52.769 --> 55:54.896
[sobbing loudly]

55:58.190 --> 55:59.358
[pop music continues]

56:01.486 --> 56:03.696
Hold tight.
Don't let her move.

56:03.780 --> 56:06.408
If you move, it'll get messed up.

56:06.491 --> 56:10.244
Make sure it isn't backwards
or it's, like, a whole different thing.
