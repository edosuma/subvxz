00:17.827 --> 00:22.561
For the last nine months,
I singlehandedly saved my company

00:22.660 --> 00:26.359
from being ravaged by Wall Street.

00:26.499 --> 00:30.080
I mean, these jackals
want our pension fund.

00:30.180 --> 00:34.439
I'm talking poison pills,
scorched earth, killer bees.

00:34.980 --> 00:39.557
And I'm pumping Nancy fucking Reagan
to anybody who'll listen.

00:39.701 --> 00:44.279
Now, do they appreciate it?
Nancy fucking Reagan. Do they?

00:46.916 --> 00:51.213
Fuck no. They turn it around,
and say I'm the problem.

00:51.988 --> 00:54.336
That I'm stifling progress.
I'm stifling progress?

00:54.436 --> 00:57.098
Bullshit, you're shitting me.
I mean, they're shitting me.

00:57.198 --> 00:58.953
Come on.

00:59.984 --> 01:02.681
A man can only take so much, you know?

01:04.016 --> 01:06.013
Maybe you're right.

01:06.113 --> 01:10.793
Maybe it's time for old Mikey
to move on. Yeah.

01:13.541 --> 01:16.140
But to what? I don't know. You know.

01:16.240 --> 01:19.386
I mean, what do you do? What do you do?

01:21.873 --> 01:23.194
What do you do?

01:24.624 --> 01:28.282
I don't... I don't think you can deal
what it is I do.

01:28.816 --> 01:30.494
What? Hey, look, man.

01:30.594 --> 01:33.132
Whatever it is you're doing,
I can do it too, okay?

01:33.232 --> 01:35.852
I mean, I'm tired
of this corporate bullshit.

01:35.952 --> 01:38.284
I wanna feel free.

01:38.384 --> 01:42.426
I wanna win the Super-Bowl, you know?
At least I wanna get a stab at it.

01:43.696 --> 01:45.754
I think you might just have to.

01:47.601 --> 01:50.585
I'm just drunk enough to talk
about this shit. Okay...

01:52.497 --> 01:55.021
Frank, tell me
what my new profession is.

01:55.121 --> 01:57.753
When do I start, and let me at it.

01:58.320 --> 02:00.281
Contract killer.

02:04.369 --> 02:06.297
Hey, where's my gun?

02:07.473 --> 02:11.257
You're fucking... yeah, fucking right.

02:11.888 --> 02:16.872
The people you meet.
You're not a contract killer, come on.

02:19.121 --> 02:22.861
Not that I believe that you are,
but, hey, between you and me?

02:22.961 --> 02:26.265
It was kind of a secret fantasy of mine
when I was little, you know?

02:26.513 --> 02:30.522
Hit man, the secret agent man, you know.

02:33.104 --> 02:35.071
Two things I always wanted...

02:35.171 --> 02:37.911
wanted to do, but...

02:38.448 --> 02:42.937
I ended up in that six by six
foot fluorescent cubicle.

02:44.945 --> 02:47.768
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay...
Let's just say, hypothetically,

02:47.868 --> 02:51.821
you are a contract killer. Okay?

02:51.921 --> 02:54.220
You're a contract killer.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.101
You've obviously had a little bit to drink,
but let's just entertain this notion,

02:57.201 --> 03:01.421
just for a second, okay?
How do I get into the biz?

03:01.521 --> 03:05.548
I don't know any contract killers
that actually want to be contract killers.

03:05.648 --> 03:08.717
There's no satisfaction in what we do.

03:08.817 --> 03:13.923
Some people trade services for a living,
others trade commodities, we trade both.

03:14.023 --> 03:17.449
Our services are our time,
effort, and skill.

03:17.552 --> 03:19.843
The commodity is human life.

03:22.096 --> 03:25.945
That was freaking well-said, man.
I'm no dummy, and that was well-said.

03:26.096 --> 03:28.173
I'm gonna be a hitman.
I mean, a contract killer.

03:28.273 --> 03:31.529
It sounds more professional.
Okay? I'm gonna be one.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.401
Bang bang!

03:35.600 --> 03:37.612
Oh, we got a new job.

03:37.712 --> 03:39.350
So...

03:39.829 --> 03:41.703
let me ask you this:

03:42.320 --> 03:45.721
Who you gonna kill next, Frank Casper?

03:46.160 --> 03:48.249
Who's your next mark?

03:57.296 --> 03:58.890
You are.

04:10.128 --> 04:13.703
Those that have witnessed execution
say there is no sound worse

04:13.803 --> 04:17.785
than the weeping of a mother
watching her son being put to death.

04:18.128 --> 04:21.113
They're wrong.
There is one sound that is worse.

04:22.224 --> 04:24.314
There is silence.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.009
I hear you have work for me.

07:15.472 --> 07:17.401
I need a man killed.

07:18.064 --> 07:21.218
High profile. Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.428
He is the number one cocaine distributor
in the entire North American continent.

07:28.528 --> 07:31.313
<i>He created the most efficient
and productive drug pipeline</i>

07:31.413 --> 07:33.803
<i>since the era of the cocaine cowboys.</i>

07:33.903 --> 07:38.769
<i>His pipeline ships over a thousand keys
a week of pure, uncut, Columbian cocaine,</i>

07:39.152 --> 07:42.169
<i>by way of Belize and Mexico.</i>

07:42.672 --> 07:45.794
<i>His U.S. distribution network
is the most intricate</i>

07:45.894 --> 07:50.539
<i>and sophisticated network ever created
in the history of the narcotics trade.</i>

07:50.639 --> 07:55.180
<i>This all makes him the number one North
American resource for the Mexican cartels.</i>

07:55.280 --> 08:00.396
<i>So, I'm sure you can understand
why he's a very hard man to kill.</i>

08:00.496 --> 08:03.222
<i>But he needs to be killed, at any cost.</i>

08:04.112 --> 08:06.489
I need the job done my way.

08:07.088 --> 08:09.081
It sounds personal.

08:09.248 --> 08:11.465
Yeah, it's personal.

08:12.207 --> 08:15.600
My whole existence revolves
around the loss of his life.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.212
I need his assassination
to be heard all over America.

08:19.312 --> 08:22.009
And I want him six feet under.

08:22.415 --> 08:24.122
I don't do loud.

08:25.264 --> 08:29.657
- It has to be my way.
- I don't... do loud.

08:30.192 --> 08:31.767
Do you do two million dollars?

08:34.159 --> 08:37.817
A million now, and a million
when the job's complete.

08:41.392 --> 08:45.036
Before you kill him,
I want you to shake him to the core.

08:45.136 --> 08:47.481
Just like he did to me.

08:47.696 --> 08:50.590
Make sure that he feels
everything I felt.

08:51.920 --> 08:55.596
<i>First, he has a team of psychos
he hand-picked for his protection.</i>

08:55.696 --> 08:57.965
<i>These are the closest members
of his entourage.</i>

08:58.065 --> 09:00.556
<i>They act on impulse and fear nothing.</i>

09:00.656 --> 09:05.407
<i>They're exclusive imports sent to him
from Mexico by top cartel leaders</i>

09:05.507 --> 09:11.179
<i>to ensure safety of their primary interest,
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.</i>

09:11.279 --> 09:15.085
<i>Sundown trusts them with his life,
and he has no reason not to.</i>

09:15.185 --> 09:17.125
<i>But I want to change that.</i>

09:17.225 --> 09:20.715
<i>I need you to reduce 'em
to nothing in front of him.</i>

09:20.815 --> 09:22.444
<i>Make him feel vulnerable.</i>

09:22.544 --> 09:26.591
<i>Make him feel the deepest of fears,
knowing his turn is coming.</i>

09:27.888 --> 09:29.840
He carries a gun, at all times.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.767
It's very personal to him.
I gave him this gun.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.958
<i>I want you to kill him with this gun.</i>

10:33.072 --> 10:34.589
It's the gun he killed me with.

10:35.184 --> 10:37.374
But you're alive.

10:38.256 --> 10:40.236
A man of your experience,

10:40.336 --> 10:42.911
I'm sure you know there's more
than one way to kill a man.

10:44.847 --> 10:47.213
There's a million dollars in the trunk.

10:47.552 --> 10:50.446
Pick it up, walk away, and the job's on.

14:40.303 --> 14:44.579
Hey, you need to come down really quick.
Charlie just got killed really good, man.

17:58.991 --> 18:01.213
How much do you want?

18:01.967 --> 18:04.667
I've got a lot of fucking money.

18:09.359 --> 18:12.003
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll triple it.

18:13.231 --> 18:15.684
Kill the man who sent you to me.

20:51.087 --> 20:54.224
I did what you asked.
Where's my balance?

20:54.800 --> 20:56.409
I have another job for you.

20:56.509 --> 20:59.756
What the fuck do I look like to you, man?
You owe me four grand.

20:59.856 --> 21:02.155
You pay me and I'm out of here.

21:02.255 --> 21:04.050
It's in the glove box.

21:15.951 --> 21:17.517
What other job?

21:18.575 --> 21:22.060
- I want you to kidnap someone for me.
- Fucking kidnapping?

21:22.160 --> 21:25.276
Are you out of your fucking mind, man?
That's three strikes for me.

21:25.376 --> 21:27.317
That's 20 to life.

21:27.417 --> 21:31.838
I fucked up the guy who was messing
with your wife, that's as far as I go.

21:31.938 --> 21:33.803
I don't even have a wife.

21:33.903 --> 21:37.100
Your girlfriend, then.
Whoever, like I give a fuck.

21:37.200 --> 21:41.021
This just bought your buddy
a one-way trip to the hospital.

21:41.359 --> 21:43.326
And I didn't even know the guy.

21:48.943 --> 21:51.307
Well, so what...

21:51.407 --> 21:55.583
You just paid me all this money to kick
some guy's ass, that you don't even know?

21:57.327 --> 21:58.732
Why?

21:58.832 --> 22:00.652
See if you had the balls
for the next job.

22:00.752 --> 22:02.762
Whatever, man.

22:04.591 --> 22:06.699
Kidnap who?

22:06.799 --> 22:08.655
Sonny Garcia's wife.

22:10.724 --> 22:12.349
What?

22:13.071 --> 22:15.283
You got some kinda deathwish, pal?

22:17.679 --> 22:19.564
Payback, pure and simple.

22:19.664 --> 22:23.087
Then why don't you just go after him?
Why kidnap the guy's wife?

22:23.470 --> 22:25.419
Oh, I will.

22:25.519 --> 22:29.482
But first of all, I want him to suffer.
To suffer as I did.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.062
Then I will take his life.

26:11.887 --> 26:14.941
That's a real cute story.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.652
How much are we talking?

26:21.199 --> 26:22.424
20 grand.

26:26.254 --> 26:27.349
I want 40.

26:29.390 --> 26:32.971
I'll go outside and I'll pick someone from
the line. They're queuing up for the job.

26:33.071 --> 26:36.125
All right, fine, fine. We'll do 20.

26:36.527 --> 26:40.155
I don't know how I'm gonna do it yet,
so, you gotta give me some time.

26:40.255 --> 26:42.428
<i>I've got it all set up for you.</i>

26:42.830 --> 26:47.435
<i>She goes to the spa every Tuesday
at 3 p.m. sharp, and she never fails.</i>

26:47.535 --> 26:49.931
<i>Just herself, no driver.</i>

26:50.031 --> 26:52.491
<i>It's the only time
you will find her out without him.</i>

26:52.591 --> 26:54.280
<i>Now, things can change.</i>

26:54.380 --> 26:57.759
<i>So I need you to keep watch
on the routine before you strike.</i>

26:57.859 --> 27:01.118
<i>I tell you this because failure
is not an option on this job.</i>

27:03.327 --> 27:05.307
<i>Sundown is usually not there.</i>

27:05.407 --> 27:08.781
<i>But if one thing changes,
it could cost you dearly.</i>

27:20.270 --> 27:23.915
<i>Don't make a move unless everything
is as it should be.</i>

27:24.015 --> 27:28.754
<i>Sundown is no man to play with,
especially when it comes to his family.</i>

27:38.062 --> 27:40.221
Let me ask you a question.

27:40.655 --> 27:44.315
This guy... kills your girl.

27:44.415 --> 27:46.975
Why are you only kidnapping his wife?

27:47.215 --> 27:52.126
Why would you fuck up a 20 grand job
with all these questions?

27:53.262 --> 27:56.766
- Now, I'll be in touch.
- Okay.

27:59.055 --> 28:00.829
All right.

29:13.390 --> 29:15.542
<i>18 seconds.</i>

29:48.062 --> 29:50.611
Hey, I need backup.
Wilshire and Graham. I'm going in.

29:58.191 --> 30:00.698
DEA, drop the gun! Drop the gun!

30:00.798 --> 30:03.069
Drop your gun! Drop your gun!
Drop your gu...

30:13.177 --> 30:16.073
- Drop your gun!
- Oh, fuck.

30:16.173 --> 30:18.827
Put your hands where I can see them.
Put your goddamn hands up!

30:18.927 --> 30:20.196
Fuck you!

31:03.950 --> 31:06.910
Fuck! Fuck me.

31:07.941 --> 31:09.533
Fuck.

31:17.859 --> 31:19.420
Fuck!

31:22.382 --> 31:24.125
<i>Señora...</i>

31:33.391 --> 31:36.811
It's little hiccup.
Let's delay the operation.

31:36.911 --> 31:40.278
<i>You mean the operation that's currently
taking place in the hospital?</i>

31:40.719 --> 31:44.043
- <i>Are you a surgeon, now?</i>
- The fuck are you talking about?

31:44.143 --> 31:48.170
<i>You shot her. I told you
to kidnap her, not shoot her.</i>

31:48.270 --> 31:49.803
<i>Now she's in intensive care.</i>

31:49.903 --> 31:53.838
<i>I gave you specific instructions,
which you did not follow.</i>

31:54.126 --> 31:58.794
All I wanna know from you...
is when and where do I get my money?

31:58.894 --> 32:00.428
<i>Good question.</i>

32:00.528 --> 32:03.499
<i>Now, my question to you is
who's gonna get to you first?</i>

32:03.599 --> 32:06.749
<i>Me, or Sonny Garcia?</i>

32:31.118 --> 32:33.366
This shouldn't have happened, Steph.

32:38.222 --> 32:41.116
I shouldn't have gotten you
into this life.

32:48.623 --> 32:52.221
It's over now. There's no more pain.

32:53.775 --> 32:56.383
It'll be over for me as soon.

32:58.639 --> 33:01.237
But first I have
to take care of something.

33:15.807 --> 33:18.193
I'll see you on the other side.

33:26.094 --> 33:28.093
I love you.

34:06.446 --> 34:08.618
How's the club business going?

34:09.998 --> 34:12.181
How's the pharmaceutical business going?

34:13.103 --> 34:16.299
Got five hundred coming in next week.
Can you take it?

34:16.399 --> 34:17.949
No.

34:18.670 --> 34:21.565
That's cool, I'll split it..

34:22.094 --> 34:23.536
It's still a no.

34:25.487 --> 34:27.612
Let's cut to the chase.

34:28.270 --> 34:31.195
He sent me here to give you a message.

34:31.295 --> 34:33.290
Boss down south?

34:33.389 --> 34:35.516
Not very pleased with you.

34:36.237 --> 34:38.880
Wants to know why
you haven't handled that situation?

34:39.887 --> 34:42.034
He also wants to know...

34:42.134 --> 34:44.129
why you're not taking his calls, Sonny.

34:44.228 --> 34:46.492
Well, first of all...

34:46.893 --> 34:49.766
tell him I'm not taking his calls because
I've already told him what my decision is.

34:49.867 --> 34:51.708
It's not gonna happen.

34:52.398 --> 34:54.570
He wants a war,

34:54.670 --> 34:58.557
he might as well bring it on, 'cause
I'm already preparing to bring it to him.

35:01.070 --> 35:03.452
You give him my message.

35:03.950 --> 35:07.437
Loud and clear, because I don't think
he understood me the first time.

35:11.726 --> 35:15.769
Secondly, don't you ever refer to me as
Sonny again, or I'll put two in your head.

35:20.910 --> 35:23.028
Get the fuck out of my house.

35:27.790 --> 35:29.629
He's giving you one week.

35:30.350 --> 35:32.315
One week,

35:32.436 --> 35:34.570
or he handles it himself.

35:34.670 --> 35:36.158
The choice is yours.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.360
My decision's been made.

35:57.678 --> 35:59.339
<i>Señora.</i>

36:41.646 --> 36:44.253
That didn't seem pretty friendly.

36:45.102 --> 36:46.863
And you are?

36:47.116 --> 36:49.770
I'm sorry. I'm Sénia, and you?

36:49.870 --> 36:53.564
You always make it a point
to snoop on other peoples' business?

36:56.430 --> 36:58.860
I wouldn't call it snooping.

37:01.742 --> 37:05.211
Some things just naturally
draw our attention.

37:07.918 --> 37:10.246
And so do some people.

37:18.381 --> 37:20.525
Is that your wife?

37:26.734 --> 37:28.688
Beautiful woman.

37:30.606 --> 37:32.662
Who are you with?

37:32.966 --> 37:35.608
No one. Just me.

37:37.454 --> 37:39.644
Then how did you get in?

37:41.070 --> 37:44.339
A woman can achieve
anything she desires.

37:44.910 --> 37:47.306
Not everything is attainable.

37:47.406 --> 37:49.404
Maybe for some.

37:50.350 --> 37:53.812
This woman can get everything she wants.

38:29.998 --> 38:32.684
Fucking do not even play.

38:33.288 --> 38:35.359
What the fuck?

38:36.499 --> 38:39.676
I'm so sorry. I'll clean it up.

38:40.014 --> 38:41.519
I'm sorry.

38:41.806 --> 38:44.074
Is this Yves Saint Laurent?

38:44.174 --> 38:47.325
I love a handsome man with good taste.

38:50.354 --> 38:55.754
I'm sorry. I shouldn't speak my mind
in front of your girlfriend?

38:55.854 --> 38:58.347
Some things are better left unsaid?

38:58.447 --> 39:00.157
Girlfriend?

39:00.463 --> 39:03.505
Oh, no, no, I barely know this bitch.

39:04.270 --> 39:06.397
Fucking asshole.

39:09.390 --> 39:12.971
- May I buy you a drink?
- Oh, I think you may.

39:13.071 --> 39:16.229
- Well, what's your weapon of choice?
- What?

39:16.590 --> 39:19.353
Sorry, I guess that's an American thing.

39:19.453 --> 39:22.220
What kind of drink do you like?

39:23.183 --> 39:25.213
I'm sorry.

39:25.518 --> 39:28.796
I'm having whatever you're having.

39:29.390 --> 39:31.691
- Is that okay?
- That's a good choice, baby.

39:31.791 --> 39:35.407
Oh, baby again. I love you Americans.

39:35.599 --> 39:38.398
- One more.
- Thank you.

39:39.341 --> 39:43.978
I need to go to the restroom.
You're not going to leave me, are you?

39:44.078 --> 39:45.757
No.

39:51.343 --> 39:53.931
Nice piece of ass right there, bro.
You're the fucking man.

39:54.031 --> 39:56.316
Damn right, I'm the fucking man.

39:57.134 --> 39:59.557
That'll be 30 bucks, fellas.

40:04.750 --> 40:07.019
- My fucking wallet, dude.
- Dude, you just had it.

40:07.119 --> 40:09.135
I know I just had it, it's fucking gone.

40:09.602 --> 40:13.198
- The fucking Russian bitch stole your wallet.
- No fucking way, dude.

40:13.773 --> 40:16.467
Pretty fucking bitch took my wallet.

40:40.207 --> 40:43.004
Nice job on the quick turnaround.

40:43.790 --> 40:45.981
You got it, baby.

40:46.670 --> 40:50.218
I've got a Asian customer
been dying for this one.

40:50.318 --> 40:53.212
He's a cheap motherfucker, though.

40:53.646 --> 40:55.309
Relax.

40:55.409 --> 40:57.692
I always take care of you,

40:57.792 --> 40:59.493
don't I?

41:01.198 --> 41:03.593
Somebody left this for you.

41:03.693 --> 41:07.081
- Who gave this to you?
- Some kid dropped it off.

41:07.181 --> 41:11.273
By the way,
this ain't a fucking post office.

41:11.373 --> 41:15.150
I don't know you, and you don't know me.

41:15.438 --> 41:17.180
Get it?

42:05.358 --> 42:09.007
Hello, Olivia.
Get in, let's have a chat.

42:09.966 --> 42:12.592
Who are you? How do you know me?

42:13.550 --> 42:18.154
I got a score for you.
Get in, and I'll give you the details.

42:18.254 --> 42:19.962
How do you know I'm not wired?

42:20.845 --> 42:24.797
Because a million dollar score
is worth more than a wire to a cop.

42:25.805 --> 42:27.773
Now, you get in, or I fuck off.

42:43.629 --> 42:45.949
I've never heard of a no-split deal.

42:46.574 --> 42:48.509
What's your game?

42:49.549 --> 42:52.810
I get what I want,
you get what you want.

42:52.910 --> 42:54.826
What is that you want?

42:54.926 --> 42:58.826
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.
You ever heard of him?

42:58.926 --> 43:00.526
Nope.

43:00.813 --> 43:03.978
Well, he's got something
that should've been mine.

43:04.078 --> 43:06.396
I want you to get it for me.

43:06.510 --> 43:08.586
What's the score?

43:08.686 --> 43:10.652
A necklace.

43:12.014 --> 43:13.902
The million dollar necklace?

43:14.574 --> 43:16.253
Yeah.

43:16.814 --> 43:19.587
How much is worth a man's freedom.

44:20.014 --> 44:21.825
<i>Vámanos.</i>

44:41.134 --> 44:42.491
<i>It means the world to him.</i>

44:43.214 --> 44:44.654
I need you to rid him of it.

44:44.942 --> 44:46.460
So...

44:46.560 --> 44:52.284
just to make sure, you want me to take
that necklace and walk away?

44:52.718 --> 44:54.588
No split.

44:54.894 --> 44:57.546
- No split.
- Why?

44:57.646 --> 45:00.512
Because he bought that chain in blood.

45:06.254 --> 45:08.593
<i>The bosses have a lot of pull in Mexico.</i>

45:08.693 --> 45:11.626
<i>It was too easy for them
to pin her murder on me.</i>

45:11.726 --> 45:15.068
<i>One phone call, and a small payoff
to some corrupt cops.</i>

45:21.294 --> 45:23.421
<i>Call it a day.</i>

45:26.350 --> 45:31.580
<i>For his so-called loyalty, the boss ensured
that I got the worst treatment imaginable.</i>

45:36.430 --> 45:40.169
<i>Twenty years, twenty hard years
those motherfuckers gave me</i>

45:40.269 --> 45:42.250
<i>for a crime I did not commit.</i>

45:42.350 --> 45:47.164
<i>And worst of all, for murdering the woman
I would've given my life for.</i>

45:47.726 --> 45:49.738
<i>Those are wounds that will never heal.</i>

45:49.838 --> 45:54.454
<i>All for a chain
and the fucking bullshit it represents.</i>

45:54.554 --> 45:59.498
<i>That chain is meant to buy him
his freedom if the need ever arises.</i>

45:59.598 --> 46:00.586
<i>And it cost me mine.</i>

46:00.686 --> 46:05.340
<i>Before I have him killed, I need you
to take that chain away from him.</i>

46:06.349 --> 46:09.010
<i>$500,000 if I split it.</i>

46:11.053 --> 46:12.906
Consider it done.

46:13.006 --> 46:15.694
- I said a million.
- Black market.

46:16.078 --> 46:18.030
Smart girl.

46:18.318 --> 46:21.022
There is one more thing you should know.

46:21.742 --> 46:24.542
He's got a soft spot for pretty girls.

46:27.725 --> 46:29.948
That's why you picked me.

47:12.174 --> 47:14.293
Who sent you?

47:17.101 --> 47:18.652
What do you mean?

47:27.917 --> 47:30.780
I haven't been this lucky
in a long time.

47:37.294 --> 47:40.107
Oh, fuck.

47:42.541 --> 47:44.093
Yeah?

47:47.213 --> 47:49.194
I'll be right there.

47:49.294 --> 47:51.402
I gotta go. Gotta work.

47:51.502 --> 47:55.563
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Five more minutes.

47:55.663 --> 47:58.621
I'll make it worth your while.

48:07.373 --> 48:09.340
I wish I could.

48:12.877 --> 48:14.933
I gotta go.

48:23.022 --> 48:25.148
I'll be in touch.

48:48.366 --> 48:52.157
Holy crap, man.
You scared the shit out of me.

48:53.582 --> 48:56.206
- Did you find her?
- Jeez, man.

48:56.589 --> 48:59.100
Don't creep up on people like that.

48:59.534 --> 49:02.953
Yes, I found her. It's not good news.

49:03.053 --> 49:05.820
What do you mean, "it's not good news"?
Is she dead?

49:07.341 --> 49:09.127
Far from it.

49:09.227 --> 49:12.202
This is her in Monaco
outside the Ritz-Carlton.

49:12.302 --> 49:15.574
A few days later in Paris
shopping at the Champs-Élysées.

49:15.674 --> 49:19.433
A week later in Berlin,
a few days later in Thailand.

49:19.533 --> 49:21.258
Yeah, I think you get the point.

49:21.358 --> 49:24.348
Looks like she's globe-trotting
when you were gone.

49:25.518 --> 49:27.689
Gonna be a hard one to catch.

49:27.789 --> 49:30.717
And more importantly,
expensive to catch.

49:34.893 --> 49:36.828
I'll be in touch.

49:37.934 --> 49:40.252
Hey, where's my money?

49:42.221 --> 49:45.358
I asked you to find her, not give me
her goddamn travel itinerary.

49:45.934 --> 49:48.027
When your people find her,

49:48.429 --> 49:52.202
and bring her to me,
then you get your money.

49:58.733 --> 50:02.588
- These things cost money, Sundown.
- Figure it out.

51:39.309 --> 51:40.330
<i>Where are the cars?</i>

51:40.430 --> 51:43.306
<i>I told you already, brother,
one more week, it's not easy.</i>

51:43.406 --> 51:48.074
<i>One I 70 T, one 7-series, one Escalade,
delivered in Dubai Wednesday?</i>

51:48.174 --> 51:50.634
<i>I'm trying, brother.
I told the guy, already.</i>

51:50.734 --> 51:53.931
- <i>What day is today?</i>
- <i>Monday.</i>

51:54.031 --> 51:56.364
<i>Then how will you tell me
one week early, now?</i>

51:56.464 --> 51:58.696
<i>How will you tell me one way
we can both survive?</i>

51:58.796 --> 52:00.138
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>No?</i>

52:00.238 --> 52:04.699
<i>So how will these cars will get to Dubai
by Wednesday, Khaled, how?</i>

52:06.766 --> 52:09.276
<i>Hold on, hold on. There's an echo.</i>

52:10.157 --> 52:14.088
<i>Oh, it's our bounty hunter,
the private investigator.</i>

52:14.188 --> 52:15.958
<i>Really?</i>

52:17.997 --> 52:22.538
- <i>Hey, you need better equipment.</i>
- <i>Mister Finley, Mister investigator?</i>

52:22.638 --> 52:26.346
<i>I was asked to give you a message.
4 p.m. tomorrow at 6th Street Bridge.</i>

52:26.446 --> 52:28.347
<i>Better be on time.</i>

52:29.966 --> 52:32.234
- <i>You hang up first.</i>
- <i>No, no, you hang up first.</i>

52:32.334 --> 52:35.137
<i>No, no, no, you hang up first.</i>

52:44.909 --> 52:46.641
How'd you find me?

52:46.741 --> 52:48.905
I heard about your speciality.

52:49.005 --> 52:51.195
What do you want, man?

52:51.693 --> 52:54.492
Have you heard of Sonny
"Sundown" Garcia?

52:56.589 --> 52:58.121
Yeah.

52:58.221 --> 52:59.977
Everybody has.

53:00.077 --> 53:02.378
I need you to get
some information for me.

53:02.478 --> 53:06.140
- Oh, for the right price?
- Price is not an issue.

53:06.541 --> 53:10.090
Well, keep in mind tracking Sundown
is no easy task. He's a smart man.

53:10.190 --> 53:12.572
- You won't be tracking down Sundown.
- Then, who?

53:14.125 --> 53:15.652
His wife.

53:18.829 --> 53:20.800
He's the head of an organization.

53:20.900 --> 53:24.201
Your superiors expect you
to keep your house in order.

53:24.301 --> 53:27.305
His wife has been slipping
through the grass like a snake.

53:27.405 --> 53:28.858
I need her exposed.

53:28.958 --> 53:31.563
Safe to assume
you're one of those superiors?

53:31.981 --> 53:33.738
- No.
- DEA?

53:33.838 --> 53:35.213
Absolutely not.

53:35.885 --> 53:40.035
Then why on Earth would you involve yourself
with a man as dangerous as Sundown?

53:40.973 --> 53:43.260
'Cause I've got a score to settle.

53:48.909 --> 53:51.272
<i>My father was in the business.</i>

53:51.372 --> 53:54.049
<i>He was down in Mexico on a deal,
and the junkie he was</i>

53:54.149 --> 53:56.298
<i>thought it would be a good idea
to take me along,</i>

53:56.398 --> 53:58.538
<i>'cause he couldn't find a babysitter.</i>

53:58.638 --> 54:02.378
<i>A quick pop across the border to Juárez
for a few pounds of weed.</i>

54:02.478 --> 54:04.572
<i>No big deal, right?</i>

54:20.397 --> 54:22.423
<i>What he didn't factor in
was the ruthlessness</i>

54:22.523 --> 54:25.169
<i>of some of the people
he did business with.</i>

54:33.837 --> 54:36.220
<i>I was kidnapped for ransom.</i>

54:40.109 --> 54:43.414
<i>They thought he had money, but unfortunately
he didn't have anything close,</i>

54:43.514 --> 54:45.325
<i>so they couldn't buy me back.</i>

54:45.709 --> 54:49.581
<i>Unable to show any weakness, the kidnappers
made him believe they killed me.</i>

54:49.681 --> 54:52.413
<i>He was devastated
and returned to America.</i>

54:52.513 --> 54:54.926
<i>But these kidnappers
truly meant no harm, though.</i>

54:55.214 --> 54:58.233
<i>They just needed to put food
on the table.</i>

54:58.333 --> 55:01.113
<i>Having no more need for me,
and no desire to kill me,</i>

55:01.213 --> 55:05.068
<i>they threw me on the streets of Juárez
to fend for myself.</i>

55:05.421 --> 55:10.420
<i>Being a stranded 10-year old gringo
on the streets of Juárez is no easy task.</i>

55:21.229 --> 55:23.356
<i>And that's when I met her.</i>

55:24.845 --> 55:27.209
<i>Her name was Sophia.</i>

55:27.309 --> 55:31.740
<i>I fell in love with her at that
very moment, and she with me.</i>

55:40.429 --> 55:43.579
<i>They took care of me
and raised me like their own.</i>

55:51.261 --> 55:53.962
<i>I made them the promise that
I would love and protect their daughter</i>

55:54.062 --> 55:55.557
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

56:04.364 --> 56:09.344
<i>Years later, she was as beautiful
as the first time I laid eyes on her.</i>

56:10.397 --> 56:12.730
<i>Innocent and pure, with a heart of gold.</i>

56:22.797 --> 56:25.564
<i>We made plans to grow old together.</i>

56:27.181 --> 56:29.596
<i>Have a family of our own.</i>

56:32.045 --> 56:33.631
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

56:33.731 --> 56:36.644
<i>I met the wrong person along the way.</i>

56:41.421 --> 56:43.976
<i>His name was Sonny Garcia.</i>

56:44.076 --> 56:48.669
<i>He was a boy at the time.
The sunrise before the Sundown.</i>

56:49.374 --> 56:51.634
<i>A man's reputation is worth everything.</i>

56:55.725 --> 56:58.171
<i>He took that away from me.</i>

57:01.613 --> 57:04.589
<i>He was given a choice,
and made the world believe it was mine.</i>

57:05.069 --> 57:09.083
<i>Including those who raised me,
and opened their hearts to me.</i>

57:11.789 --> 57:13.660
And I'm gonna give him another.

57:14.796 --> 57:18.088
How is the intel I'm gonna gather
helping your revenge?

57:18.188 --> 57:20.924
Because it will go to those
who raised him.

57:21.613 --> 57:24.787
They'll give him a couple of choices,
and I think I know which one he'll take,

57:24.887 --> 57:27.278
- and that'll be his downfall.
- That's it?

57:27.758 --> 57:31.001
That's all you're gonna do to get revenge.
The guy killed your girlfriend, dude.

57:31.101 --> 57:33.100
He's powerful.

57:33.645 --> 57:37.737
I will kill him, but I want him
to suffer like I've suffered.

57:40.493 --> 57:42.521
<i>She's working with the DEA.</i>

57:42.621 --> 57:46.121
<i>With the case exposed,
Sundown is being extra cautious.</i>

57:46.221 --> 57:49.130
<i>Their only way to him now,
is through his wife.</i>

57:49.230 --> 57:52.247
<i>She knows everything,
and they've fooled her into thinking</i>

57:52.347 --> 57:55.642
<i>that she can serve up to life
behind bars for complicity.</i>

57:55.742 --> 57:59.690
<i>They're offering her immunity for further
information, as well as her testimony.</i>

57:59.790 --> 58:02.601
<i>This will cost the Mexican bosses
a lot of revenue.</i>

58:02.701 --> 58:04.649
<i>I need to have her exposed.</i>

58:04.749 --> 58:09.632
<i>Only then will he be presented
with the choice I expect them to give him.</i>

58:10.988 --> 58:12.350
How much?

58:15.149 --> 58:17.158
Name your price.

58:57.613 --> 59:00.399
You're gonna get me fucking killed
with these meetings.

59:00.941 --> 59:03.210
You better have some kind of Witness
Protection Program to put me in.

59:03.310 --> 59:06.090
Do you even know who these people are?
What they're capable of?

59:06.190 --> 59:09.338
If anybody gets wind of this now,
I'm a gonner.

59:09.438 --> 59:12.508
You'll be fine.
It's not the first time we've done this.

59:13.965 --> 59:16.328
Now, you tell us what we want,

59:16.428 --> 59:19.256
<i>and you can put
this entire process behind you.</i>

59:19.356 --> 59:23.418
- Like promised, we'll take care of you.
- Damn fucking right, you'll take care of me.

59:23.518 --> 59:27.273
Don't get too cocky, Missus Garcia,
you need us more than we need you.

59:27.373 --> 59:31.163
Now, we're willing to work with you,
but you need to reciprocate.

59:35.628 --> 59:39.036
We need him red-handed.
Can you facilitate that?

59:40.237 --> 59:41.550
When is the next shipment?

59:42.125 --> 59:45.337
<i>How does he get the goods into
the country? Who does he talk to?</i>

59:45.437 --> 59:48.203
Just one fucking question
at a time, okay?

59:49.004 --> 59:50.619
Okay.

01:00:00.492 --> 01:00:03.789
He makes about two shipments a week.
Sometimes more.

01:00:04.269 --> 01:00:06.395
Never less than two.

01:00:06.893 --> 01:00:08.862
<i>It comes in through South America.</i>

01:00:09.805 --> 01:00:12.667
He facilitates it
through the Mexican border.

01:00:13.037 --> 01:00:14.984
Everyone's in on it.

01:00:15.084 --> 01:00:17.307
Everyone gets paid.

01:00:19.436 --> 01:00:21.577
It's basically foolproof.

01:00:21.677 --> 01:00:24.959
We already know all this, Mrs. Garcia.
We need to know how.

01:00:25.869 --> 01:00:29.823
Now, I can't offer you immunity
if you don't cooperate.

01:00:30.573 --> 01:00:35.355
So you tell us what we want, we'll give you
what you need. It is as simple as that.

01:00:42.828 --> 01:00:46.345
<i>Don't get too cocky, Mrs. Garcia,
you need us more than we need you.</i>

01:00:46.445 --> 01:00:49.610
<i>Now, we're willing to work with you,
but you need to reciprocate.</i>

01:00:49.773 --> 01:00:52.617
<i>We need him red-handed.
Can you facilitate that?</i>

01:00:52.717 --> 01:00:54.144
<i>When is the next shipment?</i>

01:01:04.749 --> 01:01:05.610
Yeah?

01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:08.652
<i>He facilitates it
through the Mexican border.</i>

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.684
<i>Everyone's in on it.</i>

01:01:16.749 --> 01:01:19.881
<i>He makes about two shipments
a week, sometimes more.</i>

01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:21.769
<i>Never less than two.</i>

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:27.899
<i>Everyone gets paid.
It's basically foolproof.</i>

01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:31.983
Who was that?

01:01:48.685 --> 01:01:50.907
The fuck are you talking about?

01:01:51.213 --> 01:01:52.699
It could be anyone.

01:02:31.116 --> 01:02:33.243
Don't worry about it.

01:02:33.901 --> 01:02:35.049
I'll take care of it.

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:54.651
<i>Fuck you! You think you made me?</i>

01:02:55.693 --> 01:02:57.129
You kill me, you lose everything.

01:02:57.229 --> 01:03:00.092
Nobody makes you money like I do,
you fucking pop-tart.

01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:05.114
<i>This is America, not Mexico, cabrón.</i>

01:03:49.293 --> 01:03:50.931
<i>Señora.</i>

01:04:19.661 --> 01:04:21.800
I hope she's not pregnant.

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.869
Yeah. She's very fertile.

01:04:31.916 --> 01:04:36.251
- I gotta go, hey!
- You just fucking destroyed us, Steph.

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.584
What do you mean?

01:04:38.684 --> 01:04:42.473
You're talking to the DEA.
I beat the fucking case.

01:04:42.573 --> 01:04:46.217
And now you're throwing me back to
the wolves. You deceitful fucking bitch.

01:04:46.317 --> 01:04:48.234
I haven't been talking to anyone,
I don't know what...

01:04:48.334 --> 01:04:51.593
- They have it on fucking video, Steph.
- What video?

01:04:51.693 --> 01:04:56.475
Video, audio, pictures, you,
talking to the fucking narcs.

01:04:58.525 --> 01:05:00.637
Remember what you promised?

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:03.676
What were you gonna
trade me in, for? Immunity?

01:05:05.996 --> 01:05:09.962
Do you fucking realize, that even if I did
go down it wouldn't bring you down with me.

01:05:10.062 --> 01:05:12.653
You already have
your fucking immunity. With me!

01:05:13.229 --> 01:05:16.393
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of this fucking life.

01:05:16.493 --> 01:05:19.528
I mean, what fucking immunity?
What does that even fucking mean?

01:05:19.628 --> 01:05:21.993
That I get to live in hiding
for the rest of my fucking life?

01:05:22.093 --> 01:05:25.596
I mean, Sonny, I'm just looking
for some fucking normalcy.

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:28.456
Can't you fucking understand that?

01:05:28.556 --> 01:05:30.441
Do you realize the position
you've put me in now?

01:05:30.541 --> 01:05:33.545
I don't give a fuck, Sonny.
You put yourself in this position.

01:05:33.645 --> 01:05:37.993
You put me in this position. You don't
give a fucking flying shit about us.

01:05:38.093 --> 01:05:41.289
All this has ever been is about is about
you and your fucking drugs, Sonny.

01:05:41.389 --> 01:05:44.173
I mean, would I give you up
for immunity? For a fucking life?

01:05:44.749 --> 01:05:48.827
You would give me up for your fucking
drugs, Sonny, and you fucking know it.

01:05:59.661 --> 01:06:01.595
You're losing it, Sonny.

01:06:32.813 --> 01:06:34.751
Watch your head.

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:45.788
Would you like a glass of wine?

01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:51.209
I don't even drink wine,
but they say this one's one of the best.

01:06:51.309 --> 01:06:52.457
From France.

01:06:52.557 --> 01:06:55.624
- Chelsea?
- Yeah, sure, why not?

01:06:57.357 --> 01:06:59.497
<i>Why do you want to buy a boat?</i>

01:06:59.597 --> 01:07:02.285
<i>Like I say, I'm a guy. I like my toys.</i>

01:07:03.148 --> 01:07:05.228
Plus, the color matches
the Bugatti, right, babe?

01:07:06.221 --> 01:07:09.045
Bugatti. Impressive.

01:07:10.444 --> 01:07:12.699
So, what do you want for it?

01:07:14.827 --> 01:07:18.313
I'm not so sure. It's my grandfather's,
and he just passed.

01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:21.544
I flew in from Hong Kong
to manage his estate.

01:07:21.644 --> 01:07:25.801
I don't know what to do about this.
But... I did some research.

01:07:25.901 --> 01:07:29.443
This boat, it's apparently
worth over half million.

01:07:30.348 --> 01:07:33.016
I'll give you $200,000 for it.
Not a penny more.

01:07:34.572 --> 01:07:36.440
200 K's too low.

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.705
Some other buyer's willing to pay more.

01:07:40.172 --> 01:07:41.097
Where are they?

01:07:41.197 --> 01:07:43.992
They're waiting for financing
to come through.

01:07:44.717 --> 01:07:47.689
Let me save you the hassle, honey.
It's not gonna happen.

01:07:47.789 --> 01:07:50.236
No one is lending, not in this economy.

01:07:51.116 --> 01:07:54.729
I've got clients who can't meet payroll
on a 20 year mature business

01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:58.281
because JP Morgan would rather earn
four points on the Malaysian Ringgit.

01:07:58.381 --> 01:08:02.312
So, if you think anyone is lending
for a second-hand boat,

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:04.526
then I got a Borneo gold mind outside.

01:08:05.005 --> 01:08:06.760
Cash is king, honey.

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.318
He's in finance.

01:08:11.564 --> 01:08:13.311
Half million.

01:08:13.932 --> 01:08:16.941
Listen, I got a meeting in half an hour.
Let me make this simple for you.

01:08:17.325 --> 01:08:20.653
Follow me to the bank, I'll pull out
100.000, give it to you right then.

01:08:20.752 --> 01:08:25.216
I'll have the other hundred wired from
a bank in Lichtenstein in 18 hours. Deal?

01:08:39.692 --> 01:08:43.002
- Hello?
- <i>I heard you have a boat for sale?</i>

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:47.051
<i>Are you not the one selling the boat?</i>

01:08:47.435 --> 01:08:48.745
You must got the wrong person.

01:08:48.845 --> 01:08:52.169
<i>Well, that's weird, because I definitely
heard you was the one selling a boat.</i>

01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:56.392
<i>Matter of fact, I heard you've already
sold it five times this week, alone.</i>

01:08:56.492 --> 01:08:59.015
<i>When do the real owners get back?</i>

01:08:59.116 --> 01:09:01.770
- How did you get my number?
- <i>Don't worry, I'm not a fed.</i>

01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:05.161
- <i>But we need to talk.</i>
- Talk about what?

01:09:05.261 --> 01:09:08.603
<i>Talk about how you can make
millions in a week.</i>

01:09:47.787 --> 01:09:49.723
Take a seat.

01:09:56.268 --> 01:09:58.590
Don't you wanna close the door?

01:10:04.588 --> 01:10:08.219
I've been following your cons.
Pretty impressive.

01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:13.000
With the boat and everything?
But the one I like is the paintings.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:16.616
That's a real good one for me.
What gets me, is...

01:10:16.716 --> 01:10:19.784
how do you keep coming up
with all these different ideas?

01:10:19.884 --> 01:10:22.088
You said the millions in the week.

01:10:22.188 --> 01:10:24.008
What's the job?

01:10:24.108 --> 01:10:26.459
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

01:10:27.148 --> 01:10:30.459
He's worth a fortune,
and I wanna rid him of some of it.

01:10:31.244 --> 01:10:33.512
I wanna do a money laundering job.

01:10:33.612 --> 01:10:39.368
I'll bankroll it. Start him off small,
build him up to the big take.

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:41.448
He's got a competitive edge.

01:10:41.548 --> 01:10:43.898
Once you get him where you want him...

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:46.586
he's all in.

01:10:49.483 --> 01:10:51.432
What if he doesn't?

01:10:51.532 --> 01:10:54.216
If he doesn't, there's
two hundred grand in that bag.

01:10:54.316 --> 01:10:58.202
If the job don't come off,
we'll call it services rendered.

01:11:00.588 --> 01:11:04.975
What if I take the 200
and disappear right now?

01:11:06.476 --> 01:11:09.609
Well, that's easy. I found you once.

01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:14.443
If I have to find you a second time,
it'll really fucking irritate me.

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.899
I'll let you know.

01:11:30.956 --> 01:11:33.360
You fucking do that.

01:12:11.756 --> 01:12:13.003
Rosco's here.

01:12:32.428 --> 01:12:35.003
Who the fuck gave you the okay?

01:12:35.436 --> 01:12:37.989
No one told me this was a private party.

01:12:38.315 --> 01:12:41.132
Now you know.
Get the fuck out of my club.

01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:44.634
Be careful how you move, Sundown.

01:12:45.004 --> 01:12:47.115
It could mean the end of you.

01:12:49.772 --> 01:12:51.655
And this?

01:12:51.755 --> 01:12:53.938
Is on your tab, by the way.

01:12:54.038 --> 01:12:56.584
I don't hold tabs in my own club.

01:12:56.684 --> 01:12:58.824
I don't hold tabs anywhere.

01:12:58.924 --> 01:13:00.923
That's your kind of thing.

01:13:02.028 --> 01:13:03.820
Your mom is güey.

01:13:04.491 --> 01:13:06.458
Fuck off.

01:13:12.492 --> 01:13:14.681
What the fuck are you still doing here?

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.769
I'm a lady, please be polite.

01:13:19.869 --> 01:13:22.637
I already paid for my drink.
I'm gonna finish it.

01:13:23.213 --> 01:13:25.250
You finish that drink,

01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:27.424
the whole tab is yours.

01:13:27.916 --> 01:13:29.080
How's that sound?

01:13:35.723 --> 01:13:37.932
Keep the change.

01:13:38.699 --> 01:13:40.872
Rosco's paying you well.

01:13:40.972 --> 01:13:43.753
Did you ever think
that maybe I pay him well?

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:46.601
You ever think that maybe I know
exactly what he makes?

01:13:46.701 --> 01:13:50.651
I'm sure you do. But do you know
how much money I clean for him?

01:13:51.852 --> 01:13:54.267
Everybody has their cleaners.

01:13:57.516 --> 01:13:59.068
Not like me.

01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:03.339
And what makes you so special?

01:14:05.964 --> 01:14:10.883
I can not tell you that.
I work for Rosco. Not you.

01:14:24.075 --> 01:14:26.234
Hundred grand, right?

01:14:28.684 --> 01:14:32.200
- What's the turnaround?
- 48 hours.

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:33.928
The return?

01:14:34.028 --> 01:14:36.315
120 back to you.

01:14:37.132 --> 01:14:39.130
And to you?

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:42.056
120 to you is all that matters.

01:14:42.156 --> 01:14:44.325
You're being paid to launder
your own money.

01:14:44.425 --> 01:14:46.696
What do you care what I make?

01:14:46.796 --> 01:14:48.603
Fair enough.

01:15:03.947 --> 01:15:06.297
120, like promised.

01:15:07.308 --> 01:15:08.808
Impressive.

01:15:08.908 --> 01:15:11.420
Here's 200,
let's see what you do with it.

01:15:29.133 --> 01:15:31.053
- Hello.
- <i>Where've you been?</i>

01:15:31.436 --> 01:15:33.284
I've got more product for you.

01:15:33.384 --> 01:15:36.253
- I've been busy.
- Busy with what?

01:15:37.356 --> 01:15:39.276
Bigger transactions.

01:15:39.851 --> 01:15:41.124
<i>How big?</i>

01:15:41.224 --> 01:15:45.512
Bigger than what I've been doing for you.
I've got to go, I'll call you back.

01:15:45.612 --> 01:15:49.004
<i>Wait, wait, hold on.
How much're we talking?</i>

01:15:49.388 --> 01:15:51.239
Wasn't that the whole point of this?

01:15:51.339 --> 01:15:54.316
Listen, I've got to make money.
I go where the money is.

01:15:54.604 --> 01:15:57.544
- <i>Plain and simple.</i>
- And where's the money?

01:15:57.644 --> 01:16:01.388
<i>I think you know that.
I have a bigger client.</i>

01:16:01.868 --> 01:16:04.123
Bigger than me?
What're you, fucking stupid?

01:16:05.483 --> 01:16:09.115
- I don't really care.
- How much are we talking?

01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:15.405
Five million minimum.
What is your term, now or never?

01:16:15.692 --> 01:16:19.259
Stop everything you're doing,
and I'll make it ten million dollars.

01:16:23.275 --> 01:16:25.147
Okay.

01:17:26.252 --> 01:17:29.762
Where you all going? Sit the fuck down.

01:17:30.508 --> 01:17:32.760
Get her done, partner.

01:18:13.548 --> 01:18:14.996
Damn.

01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:27.740
I heard that you guys
got a lot of money hidden here.

01:18:28.315 --> 01:18:30.473
Are the rumors true?

01:18:30.892 --> 01:18:33.146
No, ain't no money up in here.

01:18:33.419 --> 01:18:35.515
No money?

01:18:37.483 --> 01:18:40.685
All the dope that y'all been
pushing up in this place, and there is...

01:18:41.644 --> 01:18:44.364
no money? Nada, zip?

01:18:44.555 --> 01:18:47.663
I didn't push nothing,
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:19:52.715 --> 01:19:54.522
The stove.

01:20:41.003 --> 01:20:43.561
- Who are you?
- I just wanna make you an offer.

01:20:43.661 --> 01:20:47.656
- Nothing to worry about.
- I worry about everything.

01:20:47.756 --> 01:20:51.099
I asked you a question. Who are you?

01:20:52.523 --> 01:20:54.784
My name's John Doe.

01:20:57.227 --> 01:20:59.482
All right, John Doe.

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:03.687
How would you like a bullet to your face
before I get out of this car?

01:21:03.787 --> 01:21:07.399
Now, I know all about you.
That's why I've asked you for this meet.

01:21:07.499 --> 01:21:08.936
How'd you get in my car?

01:21:09.036 --> 01:21:11.408
Come on, you're a cop.
You know how that works.

01:21:13.803 --> 01:21:15.487
So what's your offer?

01:21:16.747 --> 01:21:19.065
Put the gun down first.

01:21:20.331 --> 01:21:23.450
Put the gown down now,
I know your reputation.

01:21:31.499 --> 01:21:33.306
So let's hear about your offer.

01:21:34.731 --> 01:21:38.157
I got a job for you.
You can earn a shitload of money.

01:21:39.404 --> 01:21:42.716
Sounds like a two-way street.
What's in it for you?

01:21:43.723 --> 01:21:47.638
Why does everybody ask
what's in it for me? Why is that?

01:21:48.492 --> 01:21:51.738
'Cause there always is. Something.

01:21:55.372 --> 01:21:57.288
Revenge.

01:21:57.388 --> 01:22:01.178
That's what's in it for me.
Fucking revenge.

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:08.621
<i>I want to take everything away
from this man I seek revenge from,</i>

01:22:08.909 --> 01:22:11.111
<i>including his life.</i>

01:22:11.211 --> 01:22:14.854
<i>But before I do that,
I want to take away his freedom.</i>

01:22:15.372 --> 01:22:17.896
<i>I did 20 years in there because of him.</i>

01:22:17.996 --> 01:22:22.279
<i>The only thing that kept me alive
was the thirst for revenge.</i>

01:22:22.379 --> 01:22:25.434
<i>He needs to feel everything that I felt.</i>

01:22:29.051 --> 01:22:30.716
<i>We used to run the streets together.</i>

01:22:30.908 --> 01:22:33.834
<i>We came up from nothing,
and were going places.</i>

01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:49.269
<i>I was there for him through thick
and thin, and so was he for me.</i>

01:22:58.475 --> 01:23:01.143
<i>But there was always something
different about him.</i>

01:23:01.243 --> 01:23:05.595
<i>I couldn't put my finger on it at the time,
but I should've seen it coming.</i>

01:23:08.107 --> 01:23:11.514
<i>When I truly realized, it was too late.</i>

01:23:14.347 --> 01:23:16.906
<i>I guess love defeats reason.</i>

01:23:18.316 --> 01:23:20.263
And he took it all.

01:23:20.363 --> 01:23:23.208
My love, my life, my money.

01:23:23.308 --> 01:23:27.761
And ultimately my freedom.
Now his time has come.

01:23:30.571 --> 01:23:33.316
Who is this mystical man you speak of?

01:23:35.595 --> 01:23:39.317
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

01:23:41.403 --> 01:23:45.208
Do you have any idea how long
they been trying to get this guy?

01:23:45.308 --> 01:23:46.951
Not likely.

01:23:47.051 --> 01:23:49.319
You don't know him like I know him.

01:23:49.419 --> 01:23:52.039
I can serve him up on a plate to you.

01:23:52.139 --> 01:23:55.017
You'll get that promotion
you've always been after.

01:23:55.355 --> 01:23:57.671
That's where you've got me pegged wrong.

01:23:57.771 --> 01:24:00.795
I am very happy where I'm at.

01:24:00.895 --> 01:24:04.474
So you can have Sundown to yourself.

01:24:05.131 --> 01:24:07.083
Okay, cool.

01:24:07.371 --> 01:24:10.528
Maybe I'll take that million dollars
that's there, as well.

01:24:13.643 --> 01:24:16.040
Nobody knows it's there.

01:24:16.396 --> 01:24:18.122
Walk in,

01:24:18.815 --> 01:24:20.588
pick it up,

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:24.111
straight out the front door.
No questions asked.

01:24:25.803 --> 01:24:28.089
A million dollars?

01:24:29.035 --> 01:24:31.653
Tax fucking free.

01:24:35.329 --> 01:24:37.079
Shit.

01:24:45.963 --> 01:24:49.276
<i>He gets shipments twice a week.
Saturday nights in particular.</i>

01:24:49.804 --> 01:24:52.776
<i>The cops are too busy
with everything else to be bothered.</i>

01:24:52.876 --> 01:24:56.827
<i>It looks like regular liquor deliveries
to a club, so no one thinks anything of it.</i>

01:25:06.187 --> 01:25:09.031
<i>The safe is right behind
the painting in his office.</i>

01:25:09.131 --> 01:25:13.338
<i>No one knows it's even there.
Not even his closest men.</i>

01:25:14.219 --> 01:25:17.640
<i>His guard is lower than it will be
after I really start on him,</i>

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:20.391
<i>so now's the right time
for you to strike.</i>

01:25:20.491 --> 01:25:24.502
<i>In a few weeks, I can assure you
things will be very different for him.</i>

01:25:25.099 --> 01:25:26.983
Nobody fucking move!

01:25:27.083 --> 01:25:29.319
All of you, on your knees.

01:25:29.419 --> 01:25:30.760
Now!

01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:33.543
On your fucking knees,
or the next one's to your head.

01:25:33.643 --> 01:25:35.336
On your fucking knees!

01:25:35.436 --> 01:25:38.747
Not even when I proposed to my wife
did I get on my knees, cocksucker.

01:25:41.867 --> 01:25:44.890
Don't you fucking dare,
or you'll take two to the head.

01:25:56.683 --> 01:25:58.555
Well, well, well, boys.

01:25:59.212 --> 01:26:02.087
Sorry to crash your party, but...

01:26:02.187 --> 01:26:04.896
I heard this was where the coke was.

01:26:08.267 --> 01:26:09.927
Am I right?

01:26:10.027 --> 01:26:11.962
I'm more of a chocolate milk kinda guy.

01:26:15.083 --> 01:26:16.858
Good one.

01:26:17.899 --> 01:26:19.642
Very good.

01:26:22.987 --> 01:26:25.284
Fortunately for you,

01:26:27.179 --> 01:26:29.325
I don't want your coke.

01:26:31.467 --> 01:26:32.771
Or your chocolate milk.

01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:40.351
But I do like the painting
on the wall, though.

01:26:42.539 --> 01:26:46.662
I've always had a thing
for beautiful art.

01:26:48.395 --> 01:26:50.266
Cuff them.

01:26:52.107 --> 01:26:54.797
My lawyer's gonna tear you to pieces.

01:27:09.323 --> 01:27:11.802
What do we have here?

01:27:13.388 --> 01:27:16.506
An emergency
million-dollar stash, maybe?

01:27:25.931 --> 01:27:27.826
Open...

01:27:28.114 --> 01:27:29.199
sesame.

01:27:47.627 --> 01:27:50.138
You think you're gonna
walk out with my money?

01:27:51.323 --> 01:27:53.043
You must be fucking crazy.

01:28:00.011 --> 01:28:03.288
Does anyone see any money, here?

01:28:03.388 --> 01:28:06.129
'Cause I don't see a damn thing.

01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:10.308
As a matter of fact, what safe?

01:28:12.187 --> 01:28:14.474
Get the fuck out of here.

01:28:19.083 --> 01:28:22.074
My friend that just walked out
the door was never here.

01:28:22.411 --> 01:28:25.255
Camron and I after our shift
came in and had a drink.

01:28:25.355 --> 01:28:27.272
Noticed suspicious activity.

01:28:27.372 --> 01:28:29.575
After further investigation,

01:28:29.675 --> 01:28:32.040
we fell upon a major drug transaction.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.207
Oh, I can see the headlines, now.

01:28:35.307 --> 01:28:40.135
Two Off-Duty Officers
Take Down Drug Kingpin,

01:28:40.235 --> 01:28:43.802
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

01:28:45.259 --> 01:28:46.892
Some crazy shit.

01:28:48.043 --> 01:28:50.173
Call that in, Camron.

01:28:54.571 --> 01:28:57.338
You fucking...

01:28:57.953 --> 01:28:59.700
moron.

01:29:03.691 --> 01:29:06.064
How dumb can you be?

01:29:06.731 --> 01:29:09.017
He was with us.

01:29:09.898 --> 01:29:15.272
He was working undercover
for years, you fucking idiot!

01:29:17.995 --> 01:29:20.232
You completely blew our entire case,

01:29:20.332 --> 01:29:23.464
not to mention you disgraced
the entire force,

01:29:23.564 --> 01:29:25.887
by stealing money...

01:29:25.987 --> 01:29:28.015
from a drug lord.

01:29:28.491 --> 01:29:30.747
Here's what's gonna happen.

01:29:34.123 --> 01:29:35.674
You...

01:29:36.203 --> 01:29:39.901
are going to jail.

01:29:40.811 --> 01:29:42.399
Sundown...

01:29:42.975 --> 01:29:45.964
is gonna have his case
thrown out by the DA,

01:29:46.064 --> 01:29:50.074
and he's gonna walk this afternoon
after his hearing.

01:29:55.147 --> 01:29:58.874
Agent Franco, on the other hand,

01:29:59.563 --> 01:30:02.024
is now gonna spend
his entire life in hiding

01:30:02.124 --> 01:30:04.491
because you thought it was smart

01:30:04.591 --> 01:30:09.242
to steal from Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

01:30:10.091 --> 01:30:12.583
I mean, not only was your crime...

01:30:12.683 --> 01:30:16.473
witnessed by a federal agent,

01:30:17.195 --> 01:30:22.037
but the entire thing
was caught on camera!

01:30:29.931 --> 01:30:33.690
You've officially traded places
with Sundown.

01:30:43.659 --> 01:30:46.073
Enjoy the next 20 years.

01:30:54.827 --> 01:30:56.953
<i>What a sad life.</i>

01:30:58.347 --> 01:31:01.927
<i>The ups, the downs,
the friends, the enemies.</i>

01:31:02.027 --> 01:31:06.056
<i>The frauds, crooks, the sneaks,
the opportunists.</i>

01:31:06.156 --> 01:31:09.320
<i>The traitors, the killers,
the thieves, villains,</i>

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:12.953
<i>the brutes, the con-men,
the merciless, the ruthless.</i>

01:31:13.642 --> 01:31:15.688
<i>And what's sadder
is that to succeed in this life,</i>

01:31:15.788 --> 01:31:18.199
<i>you have to be the best of all of them.</i>

01:31:18.299 --> 01:31:20.601
<i>Bottled into a single man.</i>

01:31:25.291 --> 01:31:27.337
<i>And then is me...</i>

01:31:27.827 --> 01:31:30.295
<i>Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.</i>

01:31:30.731 --> 01:31:33.544
<i>The most notorious narcotics dealer
in the northern hemisphere,</i>

01:31:33.644 --> 01:31:36.123
<i>and I have lived a life of crime.</i>

01:31:40.139 --> 01:31:42.169
<i>But no more.</i>

01:31:44.618 --> 01:31:49.127
<i>How do you get away with a perfect crime?
There's no such thing.</i>

01:31:49.227 --> 01:31:53.095
<i>How do you get away with a lifetime
of crime? That's simple.</i>

01:31:53.195 --> 01:31:55.207
<i>Make 'em think you haven't.</i>

01:31:55.307 --> 01:31:57.850
<i>I knew the feds were minutes away
from getting their man.</i>

01:31:57.950 --> 01:32:01.052
<i>So what did I do?
I gave 'em what they wanted.</i>

01:32:01.435 --> 01:32:04.327
You don't know him like I know him.
I can serve him up on a plate to you.

01:32:04.427 --> 01:32:06.312
You'll get that promotion
you've always been after.

01:32:06.412 --> 01:32:09.653
- A million dollars?
- Tax fucking free.

01:32:09.753 --> 01:32:13.863
<i>The corrupt cop was perfect for the job.
There's no way she could resist the bait.</i>

01:32:13.963 --> 01:32:15.169
He was with us.

01:32:15.269 --> 01:32:17.992
<i>I knew all I did was buy myself
some time, but it was necessary.</i>

01:32:18.092 --> 01:32:21.675
Sundown is gonna have his case
thrown out by the DA.

01:32:21.775 --> 01:32:25.629
And he's gonna walk this afternoon,
after his hearing.

01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:29.472
<i>When it came to the cartels, and the boss
down in Mexico, that was a different story.</i>

01:32:29.827 --> 01:32:32.986
<i>Once in that world, you can't
just leave by your own free will.</i>

01:32:37.643 --> 01:32:40.072
<i>So what did I do? I had them oust me.</i>

01:32:40.172 --> 01:32:42.215
He sent me here to give you a message.

01:32:42.315 --> 01:32:44.424
Boss down south,
not very pleased with you.

01:32:44.524 --> 01:32:46.311
Wants to know why you haven't
handled that situation.

01:32:46.411 --> 01:32:49.416
One week, or he handles it himself.
The choice is yours.

01:32:49.516 --> 01:32:51.290
My decision's been made.

01:32:59.259 --> 01:33:02.773
<i>Tarnished my reputation and made sure they'd
never wanna do business with me again.</i>

01:33:03.429 --> 01:33:04.280
<i>Señora.</i>

01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:07.224
- I need you to get some information for me.
- For the right price?

01:33:07.324 --> 01:33:09.223
<i>I found the right guy to make it happen.</i>

01:33:09.323 --> 01:33:11.799
<i>Thought he was working for me,
then working against me...</i>

01:33:11.899 --> 01:33:14.887
Yes, I found her.
These things cost money, Sundown!

01:33:14.987 --> 01:33:18.329
<i>Learns he was simply working
for me the entire time.</i>

01:33:19.338 --> 01:33:22.439
<i>In order for dismantling an empire,
it must crumble entirely.</i>

01:33:22.539 --> 01:33:25.415
<i>Not one brick left standing.
Eliminate my money.</i>

01:33:25.515 --> 01:33:27.857
You said millions in the week.
What's the job?

01:33:27.957 --> 01:33:30.088
He's worth a fortune,
and I wanna rid him of some of it.

01:33:30.188 --> 01:33:33.883
I wanna do a money laundering job. Start
him off small, build him up to the big take.

01:33:33.983 --> 01:33:36.903
- Once you get him where you want him...
- Stop everything you're doing...

01:33:37.003 --> 01:33:39.523
and I'll make it 10 million dollars.

01:33:40.043 --> 01:33:42.887
- And he's all-in.
- <i>Make him think I'm destroyed.</i>

01:33:42.987 --> 01:33:45.216
<i>Money means power in this world,
and when it's gone</i>

01:33:45.316 --> 01:33:48.327
<i>you'd be surprised
how fast people disappear.</i>

01:33:48.427 --> 01:33:49.707
<i>And that's just what I wanted.</i>

01:33:50.282 --> 01:33:52.011
He's got something
that should've been mine.

01:33:52.202 --> 01:33:54.536
- I want you to get it for me.
- A million dollar necklace?

01:33:54.636 --> 01:33:57.484
- Why?
- Because he bought that chain in blood.

01:33:57.963 --> 01:34:00.464
<i>It was my right of passage
into this world,</i>

01:34:00.564 --> 01:34:03.558
<i>represented everything
I wanted to leave behind.</i>

01:34:03.658 --> 01:34:06.410
<i>There was no way I could've brought it
with me on my new journey.</i>

01:34:07.562 --> 01:34:09.848
<i>My love, my beautiful love...</i>

01:34:09.948 --> 01:34:13.611
I want you to kidnap someone for me.
Sonny Garcia's wife.

01:34:20.042 --> 01:34:24.276
<i>The saddest part of my journey,
I truly never meant for that to happen.</i>

01:34:24.907 --> 01:34:26.828
<i>But he sure paid for his deeds.</i>

01:34:27.211 --> 01:34:30.521
<i>Now, my question to you is,
who's gonna get to you first?</i>

01:34:33.226 --> 01:34:35.720
<i>Me, or Sonny Garcia?</i>

01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:38.614
<i>The job was simple. Two words...</i>

01:34:38.714 --> 01:34:40.424
<i>Kidnap. Her.</i>

01:34:40.524 --> 01:34:44.263
<i>That woulda bought me enough time to
execute my plan without her meddling in it.</i>

01:34:44.363 --> 01:34:47.304
<i>There's no way I coulda risked her
allowing them to build a case against me</i>

01:34:47.404 --> 01:34:49.031
<i>right before my disappearance.</i>

01:34:49.131 --> 01:34:51.559
<i>Which brings me to that point.
My disappearance.</i>

01:34:51.659 --> 01:34:55.431
<i>How do you get away with a lifetime
of crime? Make them think you haven't.</i>

01:34:55.531 --> 01:34:57.287
<i>And in doing so, go all-in.</i>

01:34:57.387 --> 01:35:00.435
I want you to kill him with this gun.
It's the gun he killed me with.

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:06.967
<i>As long as it's done with my own gun,
conveniently loaded with blanks,</i>

01:35:07.067 --> 01:35:11.946
<i>Deleted from existence...
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia is no more.</i>

01:35:12.938 --> 01:35:15.764
I need his assassination
to be heard all over America.

01:35:15.864 --> 01:35:18.836
My whole existence revolves
around the loss of his life.

01:35:18.936 --> 01:35:21.291
<i>The only one that's left
is our dear friend, John Doe.</i>

01:35:21.483 --> 01:35:24.194
- I'll be in touch.
- No, I'll be in touch.

01:35:26.185 --> 01:35:30.283
<i>He didn't just come from my imagination.
He lived within me.</i>

01:35:30.693 --> 01:35:33.863
<i>A man nobody knew but me. My true self.</i>

01:35:33.963 --> 01:35:37.603
<i>I fought Sonny down for my entire life,
but he was a monster.</i>

01:35:37.703 --> 01:35:40.350
<i>Undefeatable. Indomitable.</i>

01:35:40.450 --> 01:35:43.416
<i>He did things that were
unheard of. Inhuman.</i>

01:35:43.516 --> 01:35:48.382
<i>The only one who could take down
this beast was myself, John Doe.</i>

01:35:48.683 --> 01:35:51.305
<i>I loved her more
than I loved life, itself.</i>

01:35:51.405 --> 01:35:54.826
<i>Sometimes life gives you
difficult choices.</i>

01:36:02.074 --> 01:36:04.073
Now his time has come.

01:36:05.290 --> 01:36:07.176
<i>I gave them everything they wanted.</i>

01:36:07.276 --> 01:36:11.655
<i>My reputation, my money,
my loyalty, my love,</i>

01:36:11.755 --> 01:36:14.121
<i>and ultimately my life.</i>

01:36:14.507 --> 01:36:16.672
<i>The only thing I kept...</i>

01:36:16.772 --> 01:36:18.728
<i>was my freedom.</i>

01:36:19.305 --> 01:36:25.192
