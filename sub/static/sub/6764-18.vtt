01:56.049 --> 01:58.142
Welcome, Brandon.
I'm Dean Trimble.

01:58.318 --> 01:59.615
Well, this certainly is an honor.

01:59.786 --> 02:03.722
So tell me, Brandon,
how does it feel to be chosen

02:03.890 --> 02:07.155
the California University
representative

02:07.327 --> 02:09.794
for the National Task Force
on Higher Education?

02:11.231 --> 02:17.761
Well, I'm very honored
and surprised and happy.

02:17.937 --> 02:21.964
Good. So do you have any concerns?
Any questions?

02:22.876 --> 02:25.674
Yeah, do I really get
to meet the president?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.845
Meet and advise.

02:29.015 --> 02:30.505
At the end of the semester,

02:30.683 --> 02:34.813
when the task force presents
its findings at the White House.

02:35.355 --> 02:38.119
That's great.
I don't know how to thank you.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.816
Listen, just do a good job, son.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.030
Number one son, right here.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.394
Let's hope he doesn't forget us

02:48.568 --> 02:50.399
when he's lunching
with governors and senators.

02:50.570 --> 02:51.832
I think he already has.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.166
Do I know you?
You look kind of familiar to me.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.638
Your brother has every reason
to be proud of himself.

02:56.809 --> 02:58.299
Yeah.
Any time every group on campus

02:58.478 --> 03:00.241
agrees on something, it's an event.

03:00.413 --> 03:02.574
That's the part I don't get.
You spit on the Greeks,

03:02.749 --> 03:04.239
you snub your nose
at the Progressives

03:04.417 --> 03:05.543
and yet you still get picked.

03:05.718 --> 03:07.481
Well, don't look
for a rational explanation.

03:07.654 --> 03:10.316
The world just loves Brandon.

03:11.491 --> 03:13.118
So, what are you gonna do
for us students?

03:13.293 --> 03:16.785
You tell me, Mom.
After all, I am your representative.

03:16.963 --> 03:20.694
- Time-out. You're whose what?
- Didn't Brandon tell you?

03:20.867 --> 03:22.357
I got accepted
into the master's program

03:22.535 --> 03:24.594
of Child and Family Counseling
at CU.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.534
Hey, that's great, congratulations.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.571
The campus can always use
another pretty coed.

03:28.908 --> 03:33.436
Steve, please don't encourage her.
She'll just go on and get her Ph. D.

03:33.613 --> 03:35.308
I love it.
My whole family's in the school.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.449
I should get
some kind of a discount.

03:38.785 --> 03:41.845
Well, Citizen Walsh.
How you doing, man?

03:42.021 --> 03:44.148
Listen, you know,
this is how Bill Clinton started out.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.451
- Same tie too.
- Yes, you're right, Dylan.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.218
It started with a trip
to the White House

03:48.394 --> 03:49.418
at a formative young age.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.257
My father's told me that
a thousand times.

03:51.431 --> 03:53.456
At least I can say
I gave him his first job.

03:53.633 --> 03:56.124
Oh, yeah, speaking of that,
are you still looking for a waitress

03:56.302 --> 03:57.826
to replace Nadine
while she's in Mexico?

03:58.004 --> 03:59.835
I'm beyond looking. I'm desperate.

04:00.006 --> 04:01.598
You know, you and Nadine
were the only two

04:01.774 --> 04:03.207
that really understood this place.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.708
- Don't even think about it, Nat.
- You're in luck, Nat.

04:05.878 --> 04:08.904
Suzanne, a very good friend of mine,
happens to be in the market for a job.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.744
And since I found you
the best help you ever had,

04:11.918 --> 04:14.045
you can trust me, right?

04:14.220 --> 04:16.380
So bring her in.
The sooner, the better.

04:16.555 --> 04:17.954
Thanks.

04:18.124 --> 04:21.753
I've heard of people changing,
but David's mutating.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.829
Well, he definitely has some problems
right now.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.863
I know he's not perfect,

04:27.033 --> 04:29.524
but if my date in Big Bear
proved anything,

04:29.702 --> 04:31.465
it's how much I want David back.

04:32.672 --> 04:35.300
I think his feelings
are a little confused.

04:36.309 --> 04:39.574
Yeah, he did ask us
if he could stay in the apartment.

04:39.746 --> 04:43.648
- That must mean something, right?
- Maybe.

04:43.816 --> 04:47.843
But I think it's a little more complicated
than you think.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.613
I guess he was ashamed to tell you,

04:49.789 --> 04:51.916
but David's started seeing
a psychiatrist.

04:55.061 --> 04:58.258
Well, I barely scraped by finals
so I'm on academic probation.

04:58.431 --> 05:03.391
I took too many sedatives
and lost my little sister at the park.

05:06.105 --> 05:07.697
My living situation is the worst.

05:07.874 --> 05:11.332
I just dumped my girlfriend
and now I want her back.

05:11.511 --> 05:14.139
It's a lot to deal with all at once.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.975
Sometimes getting out of bed
in the morning

05:16.149 --> 05:18.413
is a lot to deal with all at once.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.313
Yeah, that too.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.250
So, what role do you think
drugs played in all this?

05:24.624 --> 05:27.354
Well, no role really.

05:27.527 --> 05:30.325
I mean, there weren't enough hours
in the day

05:30.496 --> 05:32.828
and a little speed gave me
enough energy to function.

05:34.033 --> 05:36.900
I thought you said
you were taking sedatives.

05:39.072 --> 05:42.269
Yeah, well, I guess I was taking
whatever I could get my hands on.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.068
But it's not a problem anymore
because I've stopped.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.907
That's a big first step.

05:49.082 --> 05:52.051
Keeping it that way
is gonna require some hard work.

05:53.486 --> 05:58.150
<i>When I teach yoga exercises,
I see the body in many pieces</i>

05:58.324 --> 05:59.848
<i>like links of a chain.</i>

06:00.026 --> 06:03.291
No, I think I'm too Western
to be this Eastern.

06:03.463 --> 06:05.021
Where'd you get this anyway?

06:05.198 --> 06:07.223
It came in the mail today
from my mother.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.368
- Your mother?
- Yes.

06:09.535 --> 06:13.027
Since when is she the queen of calm?
She makes coffee nervous.

06:20.513 --> 06:21.980
I didn't mean to interrupt.

06:22.815 --> 06:25.283
No. Sorry, we were just...

06:25.451 --> 06:27.544
Laughing.
You don't need to apologize.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.488
Listen, Donna, there's something
I really need to tell you.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.460
Kelly already knows.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.955
I'll leave you two alone.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.530
Thanks.

06:47.974 --> 06:49.839
What is it?

06:56.048 --> 06:57.845
For the past few weeks,

06:58.017 --> 07:00.212
somehow I started doing
crystal meth.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.483
You know, speed.

07:03.856 --> 07:07.292
So I could stay awake
for my stupid radio show.

07:10.029 --> 07:12.361
Well, I guess
it really screwed me up.

07:15.134 --> 07:17.295
And I just wanted to apologize
for everything I've done.

07:17.470 --> 07:18.732
I know I've been a real jerk.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.467
Well, now you know.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.010
Well, are you okay now?

07:31.484 --> 07:35.318
Well, I'm clean
and I'm seeing a shrink.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.413
I'm glad to hear that.

07:39.725 --> 07:43.217
Listen, I know I took a good thing
and trashed it.

07:43.396 --> 07:46.854
And if you want to toss me out,
well, who could blame you?

07:48.267 --> 07:51.168
But if there's anything I can do
to fix things, please tell me.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.935
I just want you to get well.

07:57.777 --> 07:58.869
Yeah, me too.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.685
Hey.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.722
Do you have a minute, Kelly?

08:15.895 --> 08:17.795
Sure, I'll try to tear myself away

08:17.964 --> 08:19.659
from the typology
of primate phylogeny.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.323
This better be good.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.595
What's going on?

08:25.271 --> 08:27.034
Are you okay?

08:28.808 --> 08:30.776
Not exactly.

08:31.878 --> 08:33.971
I'm...

08:34.145 --> 08:35.306
I'm pregnant.

08:35.481 --> 08:36.971
Oh, my God. Are you sure?

08:37.582 --> 08:38.948
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.712
What are you gonna do?

08:41.287 --> 08:46.452
I've just started college.
I don't feel like I have a lot of choice.

08:48.728 --> 08:51.629
Kelly, have you ever had to?

08:52.565 --> 08:55.398
- Did you get...?
- An abortion?

08:55.568 --> 08:57.160
No, I haven't.

09:00.773 --> 09:03.799
I don't mean to sound rude,
but do you know who the father is?

09:03.976 --> 09:06.069
Jesse.

09:06.245 --> 09:09.043
I know exactly when it happened.
One time.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.080
One time without protection.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.218
And what does Jesse say about it?

09:13.686 --> 09:16.280
That's another problem. I...

09:16.455 --> 09:18.116
I don't know
if I should tell him or not.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.850
Kelly, he comes
from this huge Catholic family.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.360
I'm sure he's not exactly pro-choice.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.590
Maybe it's not as bad as you think.

09:28.434 --> 09:32.063
I mean, he wasn't too religious
to sleep with you, right?

09:34.240 --> 09:36.902
However it turns out, you know
that you can count on me for support,

09:37.076 --> 09:38.600
or money, or whatever.

09:40.546 --> 09:43.606
But, Andrea, don't you think
he deserves to know what's going on?

09:44.650 --> 09:46.277
Yeah.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.819
Yeah, I guess.

09:54.293 --> 09:56.921
Hey, Nat, you remember my friend,
Suzanne, yeah?

09:57.096 --> 09:58.120
Suzanne, this is Brandon.

09:58.297 --> 09:59.730
- Hi, Suzanne.
- Oh, hi.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.491
- The well-dressed one.
- Hi, how are you?

10:01.667 --> 10:05.626
Listen, I appreciate this opportunity
to interview for the waitress position.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.670
Okay.

10:11.077 --> 10:12.135
You have good references.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.078
Forget the interview.
The job's yours.

10:17.249 --> 10:18.307
Just like that?

10:18.484 --> 10:20.748
If you're as good as Dylan says
you are, I'm home free.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.480
Well, thank you.
And the hours are perfect.

10:23.656 --> 10:26.318
- I can pick up Erica after school.
- Excellent.

10:26.492 --> 10:29.689
Come on, I'll show you around.
Excuse me.

10:29.862 --> 10:31.955
I tell you, man, Suzanne,
I told her I'd help her out,

10:32.131 --> 10:33.393
she says she wants to get a job.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.966
That's a good sign. Give her
a chance to set down some roots.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.161
Yeah. Thank God for Nat, huh?

10:39.338 --> 10:42.136
Oh, look, he's giving her
the same tour I got.

10:44.343 --> 10:47.039
"You see this?
Some people call this silverware.

10:47.213 --> 10:51.206
Why? It's not silver.
And other people call it flatware.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.511
<i>- Why?
- Why? It's not flat. "</i>

10:53.686 --> 10:57.087
- So do you miss it much?
- Nat? Yes.

10:57.256 --> 10:59.850
Serving food to strangers
at minimum wage? No.

11:00.026 --> 11:03.393
Well, you're a real mover
and a shaker now.

11:03.562 --> 11:05.393
Thank you.

11:06.098 --> 11:09.465
Here it is, the moment of initiation.
The passing of the tray.

11:09.635 --> 11:11.466
Then, you know,
here's your old knife and fork.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.502
And then...

11:26.585 --> 11:29.110
- Call 911.
- Yeah, you got it, buddy.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.013
Look out.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.384
Nat, you all right, Nat?

11:32.558 --> 11:35.550
Yeah, we have a possible
cardiac arrest at the Peach Pit.

11:35.728 --> 11:36.990
Can you get the address?

11:37.163 --> 11:39.961
Okay, great, yeah.
As soon as possible. Thanks.

11:40.332 --> 11:43.301
- Oh, no.
- All right, they're on their way.

11:43.469 --> 11:46.404
- No pulse, man.
- All right, let's go.

11:48.674 --> 11:51.142
One, two, three, four, five.

11:53.612 --> 11:57.048
One, two, three, four, five.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.310
Come on, man.
They're gonna be here, come on.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.681
One, two, three...

12:05.191 --> 12:08.490
I'm just glad he's a vet.
He's got some kind of health plan.

12:08.661 --> 12:09.685
Yeah.

12:09.862 --> 12:12.160
What do you think's going on in there
right now?

12:12.331 --> 12:13.628
I don't know.

12:13.799 --> 12:17.257
I got a feeling we're going to find out.
There's his cousin Joey.

12:18.971 --> 12:22.805
- Good, good. You're both still here.
- What'd the doctor say?

12:22.975 --> 12:25.273
You know doctors.
A lot of $5 words.

12:26.011 --> 12:28.104
But it sounded hopeful, okay?

12:28.280 --> 12:32.011
Nat's gotta be in the cardiac care unit
for a few days at least.

12:32.184 --> 12:37.850
And then he's gotta get strong enough
for bypass surgery.

12:41.994 --> 12:43.052
Poor little Butch.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.122
- Butch?
- Yeah.

12:45.865 --> 12:49.266
It was a nickname
his father used to have for him.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.734
You know, growing up,
I used to look after that guy.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.396
- Well, it's great you could be here.
- Of course I'm here.

12:55.574 --> 12:58.805
Hey, Nat made a special request
to see you.

12:58.978 --> 13:01.105
I thought the doctor said
it was immediate family only.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.612
No, no, it's okay, he cleared you.
Go ahead.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.011
Okay. Thanks.

13:05.184 --> 13:08.119
- Tell him I'm pulling for him, bro.
- Will do.

13:39.151 --> 13:42.678
I guess some people will do anything
to get a little attention, huh?

14:16.388 --> 14:17.582
Yeah, he wanted me to tell you

14:17.756 --> 14:19.917
that we won't be needing
any dairy deliveries.

14:20.092 --> 14:22.151
No, no, none at all.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.262
All right, any accounts receivable
you have,

14:24.430 --> 14:27.160
you just forward them
and they'll be settled, okay?

14:27.333 --> 14:29.301
That's right. No deliveries.

14:29.468 --> 14:32.869
Hey, thanks, Karl. Okay, bye.

14:34.273 --> 14:37.731
You know, Joey,
you could tell them what's wrong.

14:39.278 --> 14:42.679
I mean, these people all love Nat.
I'm sure they'd wanna know.

14:43.315 --> 14:46.216
Just let me take care of the dirty work
so there's no mistakes, okay?

14:46.385 --> 14:48.012
I mean, the last thing he needs

14:48.187 --> 14:50.621
is to be running up a tab
with his suppliers.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.515
Hey, Brandon,

14:54.627 --> 14:55.651
thanks, huh?

14:55.828 --> 14:56.954
I mean, if it wasn't for you,

14:57.129 --> 14:59.029
I would never have found anything
around here.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.429
Yeah, well, I pretty much
ran this place for Nat this summer.

15:03.602 --> 15:04.899
I know my way around.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.197
You know,
he's lucky to have a friend like you.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.472
He'll be back.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.534
Yeah.

15:26.292 --> 15:28.260
Andrea.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.553
Hi.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.323
So I guess this is it?

15:35.401 --> 15:37.494
What are you talking about?

15:37.670 --> 15:39.399
Usually when a girl says
"We've got to talk,"

15:39.571 --> 15:41.562
and she looks like you do,
it means it's all over.

15:43.242 --> 15:45.710
I hope it's not all over.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.474
Thank God.

15:52.084 --> 15:54.575
I thought you were going to break up
with me.

15:54.753 --> 15:57.119
Anything else I can handle.

15:58.657 --> 16:00.147
What do you say
we do this over lunch?

16:00.926 --> 16:01.984
Great.

16:02.161 --> 16:04.425
I usually talk better
with my mouth full anyway.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.257
Come on, let's go.

16:10.269 --> 16:13.898
What are you doing?
Wait, what are you doing?

16:16.041 --> 16:18.532
Jesse, it's amazing.

16:18.711 --> 16:22.306
Well, it's an amazing day.
The best of the best.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.745
Why, what's going on?

16:25.384 --> 16:26.817
Okay.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.886
A couple of months ago,
I applied for a clerkship

16:29.054 --> 16:30.419
with the Federal Court of Appeals.

16:30.589 --> 16:33.251
Everybody does it
so I didn't give it much thought.

16:33.425 --> 16:37.623
Then this morning I get the call
from Judge Meinor in San Francisco.

16:37.796 --> 16:41.562
Jesse! Oh, that's great.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.999
- That's wonderful.
- My mother is convinced

16:44.169 --> 16:46.797
I'm gonna be the first Latino
Supreme Court justice.

16:46.972 --> 16:48.405
Well, you have my vote.

16:50.109 --> 16:52.339
All right, sit, sit, sit.

16:53.979 --> 16:57.915
So... congratulations.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.517
You are hitched
to a future power player.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.648
Hitched?

17:03.122 --> 17:07.183
Okay, hitched is probably
the wrong word.

17:08.193 --> 17:11.390
But I think you should spend next
summer with me up in San Francisco.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.521
Say you will.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.164
Jesse...

17:20.339 --> 17:21.499
Say you will.

17:25.477 --> 17:28.502
Okay, I will.

17:36.188 --> 17:41.216
All right, so fire away.
What'd you wanna talk about?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.624
Nothing.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.325
How you holding up?

17:51.437 --> 17:53.701
Well, we'll see tonight
when I'm on the air.

17:53.872 --> 17:55.806
You're doing the show?

17:55.974 --> 17:57.464
I thought your therapist said

17:57.643 --> 18:00.111
to avoid places
that got you into trouble.

18:00.279 --> 18:02.543
I know.
And the radio station's ground zero.

18:02.714 --> 18:05.012
But I've got to start
being responsible.

18:05.184 --> 18:09.814
I made a commitment
and now I have to exit gracefully.

18:09.988 --> 18:14.152
Well, if it's going to be too big
a risk for you, I can do it.

18:14.326 --> 18:16.089
Thanks.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.525
But you can't handle
the graveyard shift either.

18:18.697 --> 18:21.393
Look, Howard will be back
in a couple of days. I can make it.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.159
What's only for a couple more days?

18:25.003 --> 18:27.767
Well, Donna thinks I should get a sub
for my radio show.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.669
What? And you didn't ask me?

18:29.842 --> 18:32.174
The Aladdin of the airwaves,
the ayatollah of rock 'n' roll?

18:32.344 --> 18:34.835
I am the original Wolfman Jack.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.243
Bro, I was weaned on show biz.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.976
Steve, it's more than just weaning.
It's equipment to run.

18:40.152 --> 18:42.518
FCC regulations. Playlists.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.553
You can make a list
for everything he has to do.

18:44.723 --> 18:45.747
And a playlist.

18:45.924 --> 18:48.017
If I can learn how to run
the equipment in 15 minutes,

18:48.193 --> 18:49.217
I'm sure Steve here can.

18:49.394 --> 18:51.988
Who's gonna know who's playing what
at 4:00 in the morning?

18:52.164 --> 18:54.462
And this way,
you can take a night off.

18:58.570 --> 19:02.666
Okay, fine. All right, Mr. DJ,
but stick to the playlist.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.274
No problem.
This is gonna be so cool.

19:04.443 --> 19:07.173
I can't wait to tell my frat brothers.
Muntz, Keith,

19:07.346 --> 19:10.440
I'm gonna be on the radio.

19:10.616 --> 19:13.551
Great, nobody's gonna know.

19:16.388 --> 19:19.551
<i>Dr. Kravitz,
you have a visitor in the main lobby.</i>

19:19.725 --> 19:22.421
<i>Dr. Kravitz,
a visitor in the main lobby.</i>

19:22.594 --> 19:24.186
Hey, Nat.

19:25.597 --> 19:27.929
- Hey.
- How you feeling?

19:28.100 --> 19:30.864
- Better.
- You look better.

19:31.036 --> 19:33.561
I brought somebody to see you.

19:33.739 --> 19:36.105
- Hey.
- Just don't tell anybody I was here.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.743
I had to sneak past
Nurse Ratched out there.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.471
Listen...

19:43.015 --> 19:45.848
You saved my life and I don't know...

19:46.018 --> 19:48.714
Nat, there'll be plenty of time
for that.

19:51.056 --> 19:53.354
Hey, we brought you
something, Nat.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.722
No more of these
in your diet though, huh?

19:56.895 --> 20:00.092
See, everybody signed it.
Donna, Brenda, Kelly...

20:00.532 --> 20:01.999
All my kids.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.293
They can't wait to see you.

20:06.672 --> 20:12.042
So, what's going on at the store?
They deliver the eggs yet?

20:12.211 --> 20:15.180
I don't know. Joey's handling all that.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.814
He didn't open up in time
for breakfast, did he?

20:25.023 --> 20:27.719
- Things were a little hectic.
- What time did he finally open?

20:27.893 --> 20:28.951
Lunch, right?

20:29.127 --> 20:31.493
Nat, don't worry
about that now, okay?

20:31.663 --> 20:33.153
Come on, just worry
about getting well.

20:33.332 --> 20:37.200
In all the years,
Peach Pit's never been closed.

20:38.604 --> 20:41.300
People count on it.

20:41.473 --> 20:45.341
- It's a part of their lives.
- Don't you worry about anyone else.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.171
You just worry
about getting better, okay?

20:48.180 --> 20:49.943
Yeah.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.114
Yeah.

21:00.459 --> 21:02.689
- Hey, Bren.
- Hey.

21:02.861 --> 21:05.159
Mom and Dad went to the movies.
But they won't be back late

21:05.330 --> 21:07.423
because it's a school night
for Cindy.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.897
So she's getting
on your nerves already, huh?

21:10.068 --> 21:13.595
Brandon, how could she not?
I mean, everywhere I go, there she is.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.036
Oh, come on, it's a big campus.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.143
She wants to go to school.
What else can she do?

21:19.311 --> 21:21.905
I hear they have
great correspondence courses.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.379
Hey, you watch it.
You're talking about my mother now.

21:25.550 --> 21:28.485
So how is Nat? Not too hot, huh?

21:28.654 --> 21:31.919
Nat's Nat. Peach Pit's his whole life.

21:32.090 --> 21:35.787
He's more worried about the New York
strip steaks in the freezer going bad

21:35.961 --> 21:37.826
than he is about his own health.

21:37.996 --> 21:39.293
That sounds like him.

21:39.464 --> 21:44.401
Well, you know, without the Peach Pit,
he really doesn't have much of a life.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.770
I'm really glad
he's got the store to go back to.

21:46.938 --> 21:50.874
Otherwise, I really don't think
he'd make it out of the hospital.

21:53.945 --> 21:55.105
What?

21:55.714 --> 21:57.409
I can't believe Joey didn't tell him.

21:58.016 --> 21:59.142
Tell him what?

22:00.652 --> 22:02.119
Brenda, tell him what?

22:03.755 --> 22:05.780
Brandon,
you did not hear this from me.

22:06.858 --> 22:10.350
Dad and Joey
had a big meeting today.

22:10.529 --> 22:13.589
Did you know Nat's cousin Joey
owns 50 percent of the Peach Pit?

22:14.533 --> 22:15.932
No.

22:16.101 --> 22:20.470
Well, he and Dad were saying
that the only realistic option

22:20.639 --> 22:22.266
is to convince Nat to sell it.

22:22.441 --> 22:26.571
Sell the Peach Pit?
They wanna sell the Peach Pit?

22:27.279 --> 22:29.975
They can't do that. That'll kill him.

22:30.615 --> 22:32.139
That's what they're planning
on doing.

22:43.729 --> 22:47.927
Hello. I'm Steve Sanders,
your host for exploring our...

22:54.606 --> 22:58.508
Good evening. I'm Steve Sanders,
your host for exploring our world.

22:58.677 --> 23:02.340
Tonight we'll take a close look
at the new world of communication.

23:02.514 --> 23:04.812
We'll meet some of the individuals
that are actually living

23:04.983 --> 23:07.383
the interactive future today.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.019
Let's go straight to our first guest,

23:09.187 --> 23:12.679
a pioneer
on the interactive superhighway.

23:20.432 --> 23:23.458
<i>Hi. Are you ready to party?</i>

23:23.635 --> 23:28.299
<i>Only $3 per minute
and you know I'm worth it.</i>

23:28.473 --> 23:33.274
<i>Press one to continue,
or hang up now.</i>

23:33.445 --> 23:36.107
Come on, Steve.
Hang up the phone, please.

23:38.850 --> 23:42.786
<i>- Hey big stud. What's your name?
- Steve.</i>

23:42.954 --> 23:47.653
<i>- Silver. What's yours?
- Kinky. With two K's.</i>

23:47.826 --> 23:52.320
<i>Is that like one K at the beginning
or one K towards the end,</i>

23:52.497 --> 23:56.433
<i>or is that like two big Ks
right in the middle?</i>

23:56.601 --> 23:59.297
<i>Whatever you want, baby.
It's your money.</i>

23:59.471 --> 24:01.234
David, are you listening to this?

24:01.406 --> 24:04.034
Yeah, Steve Silver. I'm toast.

24:04.209 --> 24:08.475
<i>I'm lying here
in my lace panties, Steve.</i>

24:09.147 --> 24:10.580
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

24:10.749 --> 24:14.583
Well, you may not believe this,
but I'm wearing lace panties too.

24:15.687 --> 24:17.211
He needs a hobby.

24:17.389 --> 24:21.519
<i>It sounds like you really know
how to have a good time.</i>

24:21.693 --> 24:23.820
Well, you're not just
saying that, are you?

24:23.995 --> 24:28.056
Because I think we may have
something really special here.

24:28.233 --> 24:33.466
<i>Oh, that must be my girlfriend, Velvet.
She really loves to party.</i>

24:33.638 --> 24:36.937
<i>Can you hold on?</i>

24:37.108 --> 24:38.234
I got a better idea.

24:38.410 --> 24:41.607
At $3 a minute,
why don't you call me back?

24:43.248 --> 24:47.150
Well, there you have it, our first
experiment into the electronic grid.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.651
I hope you learned something
because I did.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.119
In any event,
I'll be back to take some calls

24:52.290 --> 24:54.087
from any of Kinky's soul mates
out there,

24:54.259 --> 24:58.491
but in the meantime, how about
a little music to feed your mood?

25:10.275 --> 25:13.073
I should have my head examined
for thinking I could count on Steve.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.475
Well, I kind of pushed you into it.

25:15.647 --> 25:18.707
Yeah, well, it's just one more thing
I wish I would've done differently.

25:20.785 --> 25:22.650
I mean, all along, with you...

25:24.556 --> 25:27.047
I should have been more open.
We should have talked more.

25:27.659 --> 25:30.253
Is that what your therapist
has been telling you?

25:31.563 --> 25:33.690
No, that's what I've been telling him.

25:36.268 --> 25:38.031
I missed you so much.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.553
What happened to the radio?

26:11.903 --> 26:14.201
Hey, what's the big event today?

26:14.372 --> 26:17.739
They asked me to sit in on a luncheon
with some Nobel Laureate.

26:17.909 --> 26:21.401
He has some ideas about improving
science education or something.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.343
Can I come?

26:24.649 --> 26:26.810
Did you talk to Dad
about the Peach Pit?

26:26.985 --> 26:28.714
No, you said not to.

26:28.887 --> 26:31.185
Since when did you start
listening to me?

26:33.325 --> 26:35.088
This is officially the last breakfast.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.887
I have an 8:00 class
three days a week

26:37.062 --> 26:39.189
so from now on, you're on your own.

26:40.332 --> 26:43.893
- We can manage.
- Anyone know where Lindley Hall is?

26:44.069 --> 26:46.503
Lindley Hall. Lind...

26:46.671 --> 26:50.664
Brenda, isn't Lindley Hall
where half your classes are?

26:50.842 --> 26:54.642
It's directly across the quad from
the Student Union. I'll see you there.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.646
Well, if you wanna wait a second,
we can go together.

26:58.116 --> 27:01.779
Oh, you know, I can't.
Donna's picking me up. Bye.

27:03.888 --> 27:05.856
Well, more for us.

27:06.024 --> 27:07.753
She really hates me being there,
doesn't she?

27:07.926 --> 27:11.123
No, Mom, I wouldn't say that.
She did give you the right directions.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.058
Well, that's a start.

27:13.231 --> 27:16.098
And I wouldn't worry about us
getting our own breakfast either.

27:16.267 --> 27:20.363
I think we'll manage.
Nat won't be in the hospital forever.

27:20.538 --> 27:22.506
And well,
we'll always have the Peach Pit.

27:24.175 --> 27:29.579
Listen, I think you should know
Nat's cousin Joey came in to see me.

27:29.748 --> 27:32.740
He's convinced the best thing to do
is to sell the Peach Pit.

27:32.917 --> 27:35.909
- What?
- He couldn't be more wrong, Dad.

27:36.955 --> 27:41.289
After looking at the books,
I'm afraid I'm inclined to agree.

27:41.693 --> 27:44.628
So you're saying it's okay for Joey
to stab Nat in the back?

27:44.796 --> 27:47.094
- You're not really listening...
- I'm not listening to you.

27:47.265 --> 27:50.564
- I'm not really liking what I'm hearing.
- Joey's not the bad guy here.

27:50.735 --> 27:53.169
He happens to be an equal partner
with Nat.

27:53.338 --> 27:54.464
With no money coming in,

27:54.639 --> 27:57.233
the Peach Pit is gonna be
out of business in a matter of weeks.

27:57.409 --> 28:01.106
Joey just wants to make sure that Nat
has something left when he gets out.

28:01.279 --> 28:03.770
Sure. By selling off the one thing
that means anything to him.

28:05.216 --> 28:08.583
What Nat really needs
to concentrate on is getting well.

28:08.753 --> 28:11.847
I'm sure all anyone wants
is what's best for Nat.

28:13.892 --> 28:16.326
Well, then why doesn't somebody
ask him?

28:30.208 --> 28:31.835
Hi, Kel.

28:32.010 --> 28:35.138
Hi, did you see this article
on Brandon?

28:35.313 --> 28:39.716
How could I miss it?
His picture is all over the front page.

28:39.884 --> 28:42.853
So how did it go with Jesse?

28:43.021 --> 28:44.511
It didn't come up.

28:45.123 --> 28:47.683
And it never will come up
unless you say something.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.294
- Kelly, I can't.
- Andrea.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.226
He just received a clerkship
at San Francisco.

28:53.398 --> 28:56.561
What was I supposed to say to him?
Oh, I have a surprise for you too?

28:56.735 --> 28:59.135
So that's that?
You're going it alone?

29:00.805 --> 29:03.399
I'm gonna make an appointment
for next week.

29:05.009 --> 29:08.069
When you were volunteering
at RAPline back in high school,

29:08.246 --> 29:10.680
didn't you ever have any pregnant girls
call up and ask you

29:10.849 --> 29:12.339
how to break it to their boyfriends?

29:12.517 --> 29:15.850
- Yeah.
- And what did you tell them?

29:16.821 --> 29:18.186
To be honest.

29:18.823 --> 29:20.723
Shouldn't you take your own advice?

29:23.728 --> 29:25.195
I don't know.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.033
<i>Dr. Forrest, dial 112, please.</i>

29:32.203 --> 29:34.501
<i>Dr. Forrest, please dial 112.</i>

29:34.672 --> 29:37.607
Hey, you look sharp.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.767
Another power lunch
with the big boys?

29:39.944 --> 29:44.472
Actually with a Nobel Prize winner.
A physicist.

29:45.049 --> 29:46.744
So how you feeling, pal?

29:46.918 --> 29:48.818
You look a little more human.
No more tubes.

29:48.987 --> 29:50.352
Yeah.
They say they're gonna move me

29:50.522 --> 29:52.615
into a semi-private room tomorrow.

29:53.925 --> 29:54.949
Then why you so down?

29:57.028 --> 29:59.553
Looks like
we're gonna sell the Peach Pit.

30:01.966 --> 30:03.433
They talked to you, huh?

30:05.003 --> 30:06.527
Yeah.

30:06.704 --> 30:10.037
I love Joey like a brother
but he's probably right.

30:12.944 --> 30:14.241
But it still hurts.

30:15.613 --> 30:16.807
He's not right.

30:17.549 --> 30:19.676
Who are we kidding?

30:19.851 --> 30:23.480
Every day that place is closed,
it's costing money I don't even have.

30:24.322 --> 30:26.290
And my doctor leveled with me.

30:26.457 --> 30:29.221
There's five risk factors
for heart attacks.

30:29.394 --> 30:30.793
I got them all.

30:30.962 --> 30:33.089
So you'll change your lifestyle
a little bit.

30:33.264 --> 30:35.255
You'll start exercising.
You'll take a few aspirin.

30:35.433 --> 30:36.491
You change your diet.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.102
How about a low-cholesterol menu
at the Peach Pit, huh?

30:40.605 --> 30:44.598
That's not a bad idea.
Not that we're ever gonna do it.

30:46.611 --> 30:49.637
Excuse me.
I need to be alone with him for a while.

30:49.814 --> 30:51.179
- Okay.
- Brando.

30:53.084 --> 30:55.450
Don't worry about the Peach Pit.

30:56.654 --> 30:58.019
Everything will be all right.

30:59.257 --> 31:01.418
All right.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.561
Chin up, Butch.

31:10.435 --> 31:13.734
Hey, David. Where you heading?

31:13.905 --> 31:15.099
I'm going to the radio station

31:15.273 --> 31:17.764
to see if I can get someone
to cover my shift tonight.

31:17.942 --> 31:21.810
- That sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah, well, my shrink thinks so.

31:21.980 --> 31:25.347
- How is that going?
- Well, he says it's all your fault.

31:25.516 --> 31:27.950
Right. When do I get to talk to him?

31:28.119 --> 31:31.282
No, actually, he says it sounds like
I have some pretty nice roommates.

31:31.456 --> 31:33.390
Well, that's more like it.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.423
Well, hey, I've been talking mostly
about Donna,

31:35.593 --> 31:37.390
so don't let it get to your head.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.122
Well, Donna is nice.

31:40.298 --> 31:44.325
Yeah, you know, we actually had fun
together for the first time

31:44.502 --> 31:46.800
since before Christmas.

31:47.572 --> 31:50.040
That's what she said.

31:50.208 --> 31:51.800
Yeah, well,
maybe we'll get back together,

31:51.976 --> 31:53.000
maybe we won't.

31:53.177 --> 31:55.668
But even if we don't, the one
good thing about us not having sex

31:55.847 --> 31:59.476
is that we really have a shot
at just being friends.

31:59.651 --> 32:02.176
And we'll continue not having sex.

32:02.353 --> 32:05.686
- You make everything sound so easy.
- Well, I'm hoping it is.

32:06.724 --> 32:08.851
Just remember.
When Jackie first got off drugs,

32:09.027 --> 32:11.291
she thought everything
was gonna be easy too.

32:11.462 --> 32:14.158
Kelly, whatever you went through
with Jackie, it's not me.

32:14.532 --> 32:15.931
I know.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.898
I just don't want to see you
tumble again, you know?

32:19.070 --> 32:21.470
Yeah, well, I'm only gonna be
at the station for a few minutes

32:21.639 --> 32:23.038
so I should be okay.

32:24.008 --> 32:26.670
- Okay, I'll see you back at the ranch.
- Right.

32:34.519 --> 32:37.215
Silver. Let me guess.

32:37.388 --> 32:41.381
Here to check the complaint calls
from your show last night?

32:41.559 --> 32:45.017
Yeah, well, it won't happen again.

32:46.097 --> 32:49.032
Jackson, I was wondering if maybe
you could cover my shift tonight.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.361
Tonight? I don't think so.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.600
Come on, man,
I've covered for you before.

32:56.140 --> 33:00.600
- All right. If you're really stuck.
- Thanks, man.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.507
Hey, listen, go into Howard's desk

33:02.680 --> 33:05.843
and get the Emergency Response
packet, will you?

33:06.017 --> 33:08.451
It's time for "this is only a test. "

34:04.709 --> 34:06.404
Come in.

34:07.945 --> 34:10.208
- Hey, chief.
- Hi.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.649
Is this a bad time?
Should I have called?

34:12.984 --> 34:15.418
No, Brandon, you know
you're always welcome. Come on in.

34:16.654 --> 34:18.518
Thanks.

34:18.688 --> 34:20.418
So how is Nat doing?

34:20.591 --> 34:24.857
Worse since his cousin started talking
about selling the Peach Pit.

34:25.029 --> 34:27.554
Nat wants to sell the Peach Pit?

34:27.732 --> 34:30.326
No, Nat doesn't wanna sell
the Peach Pit.

34:30.701 --> 34:32.464
Nat's sick and he's scared

34:32.637 --> 34:34.628
and he knows that without
somebody to run the place,

34:34.806 --> 34:36.774
there's not really much good
in holding on to it.

34:36.940 --> 34:38.704
Sounds like the end of an era.

34:40.210 --> 34:42.042
Maybe not.

34:44.649 --> 34:46.879
I'm thinking about running the place
myself.

34:48.052 --> 34:49.815
Brandon,
there has to be another way.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.885
I'm the only person
who knows how to do it.

34:53.056 --> 34:55.889
The problem is,
I just got on this task force

34:56.060 --> 34:57.254
and I wanna meet the president.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.419
But I'm thinking there's a way
I can squeeze it in.

34:59.597 --> 35:01.963
I mean, you'd find a way,
wouldn't you?

35:04.402 --> 35:05.994
Andrea?

35:11.943 --> 35:14.036
Hey, what's the matter?

35:16.047 --> 35:17.776
What's the matter?

35:19.283 --> 35:20.841
Nothing.

35:21.686 --> 35:24.382
Nothing, except that I'm...

35:26.991 --> 35:29.186
Right now,
I'm not able to do anything.

35:31.729 --> 35:33.253
Brandon, I'm pregnant.

35:34.765 --> 35:35.823
You're pregnant?

35:36.667 --> 35:38.794
Last year at this time
I was on my way to Yale.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.631
And now...

35:41.572 --> 35:43.870
Now I'm getting ready
for an abortion.

35:45.176 --> 35:47.269
Andrea, I'm sorry.

35:50.214 --> 35:51.613
How's Jesse with this?

35:53.951 --> 35:55.680
I can't tell him.

35:55.853 --> 35:57.616
You haven't told him? Why not?

36:00.625 --> 36:03.116
I'm afraid of losing him.

36:04.695 --> 36:08.096
I mean,
he's an amazing guy, Brandon.

36:08.266 --> 36:11.394
He's funny, he's smart

36:11.569 --> 36:13.799
and he's got his whole future
ahead of him.

36:13.971 --> 36:17.270
And I don't wanna ruin that.

36:21.646 --> 36:23.614
I love him.

36:24.582 --> 36:26.379
Does he love you?

36:28.019 --> 36:29.543
Yeah.

36:30.354 --> 36:33.755
Well, if he loves you,
he's not gonna leave you.

36:36.093 --> 36:38.254
I mean, if I was Jesse,

36:38.429 --> 36:40.659
I'd want to be the one sitting here
right now.

36:59.684 --> 37:02.209
<i>- KXEO.
- David?</i>

37:03.354 --> 37:06.084
Donna.
How did you know I was here?

37:06.257 --> 37:09.055
I didn't. I was just calling around.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.218
I got worried.
Kelly said you'd be home soon.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.386
Yeah, well, I couldn't get anyone
to cover my shift

37:13.564 --> 37:15.327
so I'm just gonna have
to do it myself.

37:15.499 --> 37:18.730
- Are you sure you can?
- Oh, yeah, I'll be fine.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.701
I'm actually... I'm looking forward
to doing it. It'll be fun.

37:22.373 --> 37:24.136
Do you want me to come
and keep you company?

37:24.308 --> 37:29.075
No. No, listen, you don't have
to keep an eye on me. I'll be okay.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.739
- I'll see you in the morning, okay?
- Okay. Bye.

37:54.071 --> 37:55.800
Getting a jump-start
on the new semester?

37:55.973 --> 37:58.874
I better.
I feel like I'm already 20 years behind.

37:59.043 --> 38:00.977
Well, you're not gonna learn anything
like that.

38:01.145 --> 38:02.612
You need the right equipment.

38:02.780 --> 38:06.739
First, the official Condor pencil.

38:06.917 --> 38:10.011
And your books are gonna need
the proper attire.

38:10.187 --> 38:11.950
You're looking a little
underdressed there.

38:12.123 --> 38:15.388
You know, I mean,
you might get a little chilly.

38:15.559 --> 38:19.461
And always, always, wear a hat.

38:19.630 --> 38:20.722
So...

38:22.733 --> 38:24.724
You're all right with this?

38:27.872 --> 38:29.703
Now I am.

38:29.874 --> 38:31.569
Look, Mom...

38:32.209 --> 38:34.404
It's a big campus.

38:34.578 --> 38:36.170
I'll try not to cramp your style.

38:36.681 --> 38:39.149
All right, forget it!
I'm sorry I even brought it up.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.844
Oh, that's it, walk away. Very adult.

38:44.121 --> 38:47.056
Okay, all right, Mr. Walsh,
it's your dime.

38:47.224 --> 38:49.784
I've got nothing else to say.

38:51.028 --> 38:52.222
So that's it?

38:52.396 --> 38:53.658
You're gonna drop out of school,

38:53.831 --> 38:56.595
you're gonna give up the task force
so you can run the diner?

38:56.767 --> 38:59.702
How many times do I have to tell you,
I'm not dropping out, I'll fit it in.

38:59.870 --> 39:02.566
You can choose to do something
incredibly stupid with your life

39:02.740 --> 39:04.173
and I can't stop you.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.742
But I'm not gonna let you
walk around in a dream world.

39:06.911 --> 39:11.905
If it was a full-time job for Nat,
it's going to be a full-time job for you.

39:12.616 --> 39:14.607
I'm not gonna let Nat down.
It's that simple.

39:16.754 --> 39:17.948
What is it about the Peach Pit

39:18.122 --> 39:20.386
that always leads
to these kind of arguments?

39:20.558 --> 39:23.391
You wanna know what it is?
I'll tell you what it is.

39:23.561 --> 39:27.361
Nat is the only person I know
that has never disappointed me.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.493
- That's not fair.
- Yeah, well, that's the way I feel.

39:30.668 --> 39:33.796
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got to get up early tomorrow.

39:58.929 --> 40:00.556
Hey.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.995
Hey, come on in.

40:03.167 --> 40:05.294
It's my old roommate from Yale.

40:06.437 --> 40:09.895
Yeah, at least I got San Francisco
and not Boise.

40:11.175 --> 40:12.267
I don't mind breaking ground

40:12.443 --> 40:14.843
but have you ever tried finding
a decent chimichanga in Idaho?

40:15.379 --> 40:18.212
You know what I mean? Yeah.

40:18.616 --> 40:20.243
Yeah.

40:21.051 --> 40:22.245
What's that?

40:23.053 --> 40:25.487
Listen, Peter,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

40:25.656 --> 40:28.955
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.
All right, see you.

40:36.367 --> 40:37.391
Andrea.

40:37.568 --> 40:39.627
This is hard enough, okay?
So just let me say it.

40:43.874 --> 40:45.398
I'm pregnant.

40:48.479 --> 40:52.882
I wrote it on this piece of paper
in case I lose...

40:53.517 --> 40:55.576
In case I lost my nerve
to tell you again.

41:19.743 --> 41:23.235
I kept telling myself on the way here,

41:23.414 --> 41:26.611
that I'd know exactly how you felt
about me by the first thing you did.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.378
Hey.

41:33.757 --> 41:35.554
How I felt about you?

41:38.295 --> 41:40.422
I thought you already knew.

41:53.077 --> 41:55.841
So with one hour left in the show,
I'm feeling tingly all over. Why?

41:56.013 --> 41:57.480
Because I am made
of charged particles

41:57.648 --> 41:59.980
traveling at the speed of light.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.848
<i>So here I am, trying to keep
trillions of particles moving</i>

42:06.023 --> 42:07.854
<i>at 186,000 miles per second.</i>

42:08.025 --> 42:10.755
<i>Because if they slow down
for a millisecond, I'm dead.</i>

42:10.928 --> 42:12.896
<i>And my shrink wonders
why I'm on edge?</i>

42:13.063 --> 42:16.157
<i>Wake up and smell
the mochaccino, man.</i>

42:46.297 --> 42:49.198
- Sorry about the noise.
- What was that?

42:49.366 --> 42:52.597
I don't know, Mexican death rock
or something.

42:52.770 --> 42:54.101
You having problems getting up?

42:54.538 --> 42:56.733
I'm not sure I even went to sleep.

42:57.908 --> 43:00.069
Brandon, look, is there anything
that I can do to help?

43:00.244 --> 43:04.044
No. And, yes,
I would tell you if there was.

43:06.550 --> 43:11.419
Don't tell Dad I asked you this,
but am I insane?

43:13.023 --> 43:16.686
No. Not for helping Nat.

43:16.860 --> 43:18.919
And believe me,
I'd tell you if you were.

43:19.496 --> 43:21.191
Good.

43:21.365 --> 43:23.333
I just wanted to be sure.

43:54.431 --> 43:57.491
I'm sorry,
we're not open for business yet.

43:57.668 --> 43:58.965
So when do we open for business?

43:59.136 --> 44:00.899
Steve?

44:02.640 --> 44:04.505
What are you doing here, man?

44:07.044 --> 44:09.604
- Hey, guys.
- Heard you needed a hand.

44:09.780 --> 44:11.714
- How did you know about this?
- How do you think?

44:11.882 --> 44:14.077
Should've known.

44:19.023 --> 44:21.958
