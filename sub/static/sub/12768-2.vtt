00:11.959 --> 00:13.917
(Pete)
KEEP DOING THE EXERCISES

00:13.959 --> 00:16.917
AND TAKE THREE
OF THE SUPPLEMENTS A DAY.

00:16.959 --> 00:18.917
IT REALLY SHOULD HELP
YOUR BACK.

00:18.959 --> 00:21.834
YEAH, I'M GONNA BE BACK
IN THE OFFICE TODAY.

00:21.875 --> 00:24.125
OKAY, GREAT. BYE.
(telephone beeps)

00:24.166 --> 00:27.125
YOU'RE GOING BACK TO WORK?
WELL, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

00:27.166 --> 00:30.250
IT'S BEEN A MONTH. YOU SAID
YOU WERE READY. BUT IF--
OH, NO, NO. RIGHT, RIGHT.

00:30.291 --> 00:33.625
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO WORK.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.041
HEY, I PUT DOWN THE NEW RUG.
OH, GOOD.

00:36.083 --> 00:39.041
DO YOU LIKE IT? 'CAUSE I CAN
GET SOMETHING ELSE.
IT'S FINE.

00:39.083 --> 00:42.667
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
IF YOU'D LIKE IT.
IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE.
IT'S FOR COVERING BLOOD.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.583
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MATCH
THE DRAPES.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.333
YOU WANT TO HOLD HIM?

00:50.375 --> 00:53.166
HE'S FED, CHANGED
AND BURPED--HAPPY.

00:53.208 --> 00:56.041
IT'S THE PERFECT TIME.

00:56.083 --> 00:58.041
WELL, YOU--YOU'VE GOT HIM.

00:58.083 --> 01:00.041
VIOLET--
(doorbell rings)

01:00.083 --> 01:03.083
(gasps)
(baby crying)

01:03.125 --> 01:05.041
OKAY, BREATHE IN AND OUT.
(panicked breathing)

01:05.083 --> 01:07.583
SHH, SHH, SHH.
REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID?

01:07.625 --> 01:09.583
THIS TIME, YOU'RE JUST GONNA
BREATHE IN AND OUT.

01:09.625 --> 01:12.583
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
STAND THERE AND WAIT. SHH.
I CAN'T. I CAN'T. I CAN'T.

01:12.625 --> 01:14.792
NO--YES, YOU'RE JUST GONNA
STAND THERE AND WAIT

01:14.834 --> 01:16.583
UNTIL I OPEN THE DOOR.

01:16.625 --> 01:18.667
BREATHE IN AND OUT.
DO NOT GO IN--
(door slams)

01:18.709 --> 01:21.041
(lowered voice) THE CLOSET.

01:21.083 --> 01:24.583
(coos)

01:24.625 --> 01:26.041
(rings doorbell)

01:26.083 --> 01:28.917
I TOLD YOU,
DON'T RING THE BELL.

01:28.959 --> 01:30.500
OH, OH. DID I WAKE HIM?

01:30.542 --> 01:31.709
NO.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.834
SHE'S IN THE CLOSET AGAIN.

01:33.875 --> 01:36.083
DON'T WORRY. I'M HANDLING IT.
YEAH, NO, NO. I CAN--
I CAN SEE THAT.

01:36.125 --> 01:39.709
LOOK, THIS REALLY ISN'T
A GOOD TIME.
COULD I AT LEAST SAY HELLO
TO VIOLET AND THE BABY?

01:39.750 --> 01:42.041
YOU KNOW, SINCE I MIGHT BE
HIS FATHER.

01:42.083 --> 01:44.458
I'M SORRY, BUT THIS REALLY
ISN'T A GOOD TIME.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.041
WELL--
(lock clicks)

01:47.083 --> 01:50.875
THAT WAS SHELDON.

01:54.083 --> 01:57.291
THE RUG IS STAINED.

01:57.333 --> 01:59.709
WELL, BETTER COFFEE
THAN BLOOD, HUH?

01:59.750 --> 02:01.750
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:01.792 --> 02:04.041
I'M NOT GONNA GO BACK
TO WORK YET.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.917
YOU'RE NOT READY.
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I HAVE CRAZY HEAD.

02:06.959 --> 02:09.125
AND I DON'T. I DON'T HAVE
CRAZY HEAD. I'M FINE.

02:09.166 --> 02:12.041
GO BACK TO WORK.
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OUT
OF THE HOUSE.

02:12.083 --> 02:14.166
YOU DON'T ANSWER THE DOOR.
I'M--I'M FINE.

02:14.208 --> 02:16.375
YOU NEVER WANT
TO HOLD THE BABY.

02:20.959 --> 02:22.750
(baby cooing)

02:22.792 --> 02:24.917
WELL, GIVE ME THE BABY.

02:26.792 --> 02:28.917
PETE, GIVE ME THE BABY.

02:28.959 --> 02:32.083
(cooing continues)

02:37.583 --> 02:39.291
ALL RIGHT, PETE, YOU--YOU--

02:39.333 --> 02:41.291
YOU ARE
UNDERSTANDABLY CONCERNED

02:41.333 --> 02:44.041
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SURE
OF WHAT'S GOING ON,

02:44.083 --> 02:46.041
SO I'M GONNA EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.417
I AM SUFFERING FROM
PANIC ATTACKS, SLEEPLESSNESS,

02:48.458 --> 02:51.083
AGORAPHOBIA AND FEAR--ALL WITHIN
THE WINDOWS OF BEHAVIOR

02:51.125 --> 02:53.041
ONE EXPECTS
FROM TRAUMA VICTIMS.

02:53.083 --> 02:55.041
HOWEVER I--I'M NOT
COGNITIVELY ALTERED,

02:55.083 --> 02:57.375
I AM NOT UTILIZING UNHEALTHY
OUTLETS FOR MY FEELINGS,

02:57.417 --> 02:59.375
SUCH AS DRUGS
OR INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIORS.

02:59.417 --> 03:01.375
I AM AWARE OF MY CONDITION

03:01.417 --> 03:05.083
AND FEEL A NORMAL AMOUNT
OF CONCERN FOR MY WELL-BEING.

03:05.125 --> 03:07.041
I DISPLAY FEW SIGNS
OF IMPROVEMENT,

03:07.083 --> 03:09.250
BUT--BUT I ALSO DISPLAY
NO SIGNS OF DISINTEGRATION.

03:09.291 --> 03:12.041
I HAVE THE NUMBER
OF TWO THERAPISTS,

03:12.083 --> 03:13.458
THE HOUSEKEEPER IS COMING BY,

03:13.500 --> 03:16.041
AND THE BABY CAN FIT
IN THE CLOSET WITH ME.

03:16.083 --> 03:18.125
MORE IMPORTANTLY,

03:18.166 --> 03:20.125
I AM A HARVARD-EDUCATED
MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL

03:20.166 --> 03:22.125
WITH 14 YEARS
OF CLINICAL EXPERIENCE

03:22.166 --> 03:23.750
OF TRAUMA AND DEPRESSION.

03:23.792 --> 03:26.333
SO BELIEVE ME
WHEN I AM TELLING YOU

03:26.375 --> 03:29.000
THAT I DO NOT HAVE
CRAZY HEAD.

03:29.041 --> 03:32.542
NOW I'M HOLDING THE BABY.
GO TO WORK. WE'LL BE FINE.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.583
WATCH OUT...

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
(elevator bell dings)

03:47.041 --> 03:48.792
MORNING.

03:48.834 --> 03:50.500
MORNING.

03:52.083 --> 03:53.625
GOOD SHOES.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.000
THANKS.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.583
YOURS, TOO.

03:57.625 --> 03:59.000
(chuckles)

03:59.041 --> 04:01.000
OH, CAN YOU...
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.208
PRESS 4? THANKS.
HOW'S IT GOING THERE?

04:03.250 --> 04:04.834
IT'S GREAT.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.834
IT'S REALLY GREAT.
I REDECORATED.

04:07.875 --> 04:09.667
OH. GOOD.

04:09.709 --> 04:11.667
HOW'S IT GOING UP THERE?

04:11.709 --> 04:13.208
FINE.
YEAH?

04:15.166 --> 04:18.333
HEY, WHAT EVER HAPPENED
WITH THAT GUY?
WHAT GUY?

04:18.375 --> 04:21.041
THE--THE HEART GUY.
THE ONE YOU REALLY LIKED,

04:21.083 --> 04:23.041
BUT HE WAS MARRIED
AND HIS WIFE WAS YOUR PATIENT.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.041
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?
NOAH.

04:25.083 --> 04:26.750
YEAH, NOAH. NOAH.
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:26.792 --> 04:28.125
YOU NEVER TOLD ME.

04:28.166 --> 04:30.500
NOTHING. I, UH,
DID THE RIGHT THING.

04:30.542 --> 04:33.291
GOOD. THAT'S--THAT'S GOOD.
(ding)

04:33.333 --> 04:37.291
OKAY. WELL...

04:37.333 --> 04:41.542
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

04:41.583 --> 04:43.959
(sighs)

04:44.000 --> 04:46.041
(mouth full)
BECAUSE, SAM, IT IS TIME.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.667
(Addison) TIME FOR WHAT?
COOPER THINKS WE SHOULD
HIRE A NEW DOCTOR.

04:48.709 --> 04:52.583
(normal voice) I THINK
IT'S TIME WE MOVE ON.
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO RUSH INTO ANYTHING.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.333
WHEN WE FIND--
IF WE FIND SOMEONE,

04:55.375 --> 04:58.709
I WANT IT TO BE
THE RIGHT PERSON.
ADDISON, EXPLAIN TO THE MAN THAT
MARRIED HIS COLLEGE SWEETHEART

04:58.750 --> 05:01.583
THAT THE BEST WAY TO GET OVER
A BREAKUP IS TO MOVE FAST,

05:01.625 --> 05:03.750
THROW YOURSELF
INTO A RELATIONSHIP.

05:03.792 --> 05:05.792
I MEAN, DRUNKEN,
IMPULSIVE REBOUND HIRING.

05:05.834 --> 05:08.250
NAOMI IS GONE, MAN.
YOU GOTTA LET IT GO.

05:08.291 --> 05:10.458
(sighs)
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU TWO?

05:10.500 --> 05:12.542
WHAT?
WE MADE A PACT.

05:12.583 --> 05:15.542
ADDISON AND I
ARE IGNORING OUR PROBLEMS.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO TALK

05:15.583 --> 05:18.041
OR THINK ABOUT
OUR PROBLEMS ANYMORE.

05:18.083 --> 05:21.041
NOTHING EVEN CLOSE TO THINKING
OR TALKING ABOUT OUR PROBLEMS.

05:21.083 --> 05:23.166
WE'RE GONNA BE STRONG.
STRONG.

05:23.208 --> 05:25.208
IN DENIAL, BUT STRONG.
STRONG.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.834
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S, UM,
YOU KNOW... STUPID.

05:27.875 --> 05:30.291
(mouth full) YOU NEED
TO TALK ABOUT STUFF.
REALLY?

05:30.333 --> 05:32.291
MM-HMM.
OKAY, WELL,
HOW'S VIOLET, COOP?

05:32.333 --> 05:34.709
(normal voice) GOOD.
SHE'S GOOD.
IS SHE?

05:34.750 --> 05:36.625
UH-HUH.
LEAVE ME ALONE.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.291
I'VE SENT STUFF. I'VE SENT
BROWNIES AND FLOWERS

05:39.333 --> 05:41.166
AND SOME VERY THOUGHTFULLY
WORDED E-MAILS.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.166
I WILL GET TO VIOLET'S.
I'M GIVING HER SOME SPACE.

05:43.208 --> 05:46.583
(cell phone chirps)
OH, OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOTTA GET TO THE E.R.

05:46.625 --> 05:49.583
YOU TWO DON'T TALK ABOUT ME
WHILE I'M GONE, OKAY?

05:49.625 --> 05:51.709
IT'S RUDE.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.375
(sighs)

05:53.417 --> 05:55.083
(siren wailing)

05:55.125 --> 05:57.125
(indistinct conversations)

05:57.166 --> 05:59.333
OH, YOU WAITED FOR ME.

05:59.375 --> 06:02.125
I LIKE DATING
THE CHIEF OF STAFF.

06:02.166 --> 06:05.166
I GET SPECIAL SERVICE.
WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR ME?

06:05.208 --> 06:08.125
ONE OF MY PATIENTS PUT
A MARBLE IN HIS NOSE?
NOT EXACTLY.

06:08.166 --> 06:10.041
11 YEAR OLD'S DAD
THREW HER ACROSS THE ROOM,

06:10.083 --> 06:12.041
PROBABLY BROKE HER ARM.

06:12.083 --> 06:14.041
MOM LOOKED LIKE
SHE WAS IN A PRIZEFIGHT.

06:14.083 --> 06:17.041
DAD WON THE FIRST ROUND,
BUT MOM THREW THE KNOCKOUT.

06:17.083 --> 06:20.166
FUN TIMES.
WAIT A MINUTE.
THE LARSENS? MY LARSENS?

06:20.208 --> 06:23.125
TAMMY AND HER PARENTS?

06:23.166 --> 06:27.500
PAGE SAM... AND ADDISON.
MICHELLE'S PREGNANT.

06:32.083 --> 06:33.041
DAD?

06:33.083 --> 06:35.583
I STABBED HIM.

06:35.625 --> 06:39.000
I STABBED MY HUSBAND.

06:48.083 --> 06:50.375
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
IN A CAST LATER.

06:50.417 --> 06:52.375
YOU CAN HAVE
EVERYBODY SIGN IT.

06:52.417 --> 06:55.875
YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO BE PREPARED

06:55.917 --> 06:57.875
FOR A LITTLE BIT
OF ITCHING, OKAY?

06:57.917 --> 07:00.250
ALL RIGHT.
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

07:00.291 --> 07:02.500
NO. I CAN'T.

07:02.542 --> 07:05.041
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

07:05.083 --> 07:07.041
I KNOW IT FEELS THAT WAY,

07:07.083 --> 07:09.041
BUT, UM,
YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME.

07:09.083 --> 07:12.625
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT WANT TO HELP YOU.

07:12.667 --> 07:15.834
OKAY. WELL, MAYBE LATER.
ALL RIGHT?

07:15.875 --> 07:17.834
YOU STILL PLAYING SOCCER?

07:17.875 --> 07:20.458
YEAH. STARTING FULLBACK.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.417
OH, YEAH? STARTING FULLBACK.
THAT'S, UH...

07:23.458 --> 07:26.250
YEAH, SEE, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT SOCCER.

07:26.291 --> 07:28.750
YOU COULD ASK ME
ABOUT BASKETBALL.

07:28.792 --> 07:31.041
I'M GOOD WITH THE BASKETBALL.
INVENTED BY A DOCTOR,

07:31.083 --> 07:32.750
PROBABLY TO GET
MORE PATIENTS,

07:32.792 --> 07:34.792
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
BASKETBALL INJURIES.

07:34.834 --> 07:37.083
IS MY DAD GONNA BE OKAY?

07:37.125 --> 07:40.083
DR. BENNETT'S TAKING CARE
OF HIM. HE'S IN GOOD HANDS.

07:40.125 --> 07:43.041
OKAY, SO CRITS ARE STABLE.
FAST SCAN IS NEGATIVE.

07:43.083 --> 07:45.041
HE'S GOT SOME BRUISING
BEHIND HIS LEFT EAR,

07:45.083 --> 07:47.041
SO WE'LL ALSO NEED
A HEAD C.T.

07:47.083 --> 07:48.250
THANKS, MAN.

07:48.291 --> 07:51.041
SAM...
IT LOOKS OKAY?

07:51.083 --> 07:53.583
UH, YOU'VE GOT A STAB WOUND
TO YOUR ABDOMEN.

07:53.625 --> 07:56.041
IF YOU ASK ME, YOU'RE LUCKY
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT.

07:56.083 --> 07:58.375
WHAT ABOUT TAMMY
AND--AND MICHELLE?

07:58.417 --> 08:00.041
IS THE BABY OKAY?

08:00.083 --> 08:02.000
OH, SO YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT THEM NOW?

08:02.041 --> 08:06.041
A LITTLE BIT LATE FOR THAT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

08:06.083 --> 08:09.041
SO HE SAYS, "SHE'S NOT DEAD.
SHE'S JUST

08:09.083 --> 08:12.500
ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHICALLY
CHALLENGED."
(men laugh)

08:12.542 --> 08:14.750
SO IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY
IS SETTLING IN.

08:14.792 --> 08:16.291
YES. THANK YOU,
DR. BENNETT.

08:16.333 --> 08:18.959
IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.959
OKAY. WELL, IF YOU, UH,
NEED ANYTHING,

08:21.000 --> 08:22.834
JUST LET ME KNOW.

08:22.875 --> 08:25.333
MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN.

08:25.375 --> 08:27.500
(chuckles)
INTERESTING DYNAMIC.

08:27.542 --> 08:28.792
(laughs)

08:28.834 --> 08:31.750
EVEN A GROUP OF TOP-NOTCH,
EINSTEIN-TYPE PROFESSIONALS

08:31.792 --> 08:33.750
FEEL THE URGE
TO GET OUT OF THE ROOM

08:33.792 --> 08:35.125
WHEN THE BOSS COMES IN.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.125
OH, WELL... THEY'LL WARM UP

08:37.166 --> 08:40.041
ONCE WE ALL GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER.
YEAH.

08:40.083 --> 08:43.125
SO HAVE YOU HAD THE CHANCE
TO SEE VIOLET AND LUKE?

08:43.166 --> 08:46.041
PETE'S BEEN TELLING ME
IT'S A BAD TIME, POLITELY,

08:46.083 --> 08:49.041
AS HE BLOCKS THE DOOR
AND REFUSES TO LET ME PASS.

08:49.083 --> 08:51.041
H-HAS HE SAID ANYTHING
TO YOU?

08:51.083 --> 08:55.041
UM, THEY'RE... KINDA
NOT TALKING TO ME UP THERE.

08:55.083 --> 08:57.041
BUT, UH, ADDISON AND I
ACTUALLY HAD

08:57.083 --> 08:59.041
A REAL CONVERSATION
THIS MORNING,

08:59.083 --> 09:03.041
SO HOPEFULLY THINGS WILL
GET BACK TO NORMAL SOON.

09:03.083 --> 09:04.667
WHAT?

09:04.709 --> 09:06.125
NOTHING, NOTHING.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.125
IT'S JUST--WELL,
ANOTHER INTERESTING DYNAMIC.

09:08.166 --> 09:11.125
YOU BEING MY NEW BOSS,
I'M HESITANT TO POINT OUT

09:11.166 --> 09:14.166
THAT IT... IT MIGHT NOT
BE THAT EASY.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.792
(chuckles)

09:15.834 --> 09:18.166
(chuckles)

09:18.208 --> 09:21.041
HEARTBEAT LOOKS NORMAL
FOR 10 WEEKS.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.041
NO EVIDENCE OF BLEEDING
FROM THE TRAUMA.

09:23.083 --> 09:25.208
SO THE BABY'S OKAY?

09:25.250 --> 09:27.208
LOOKS FINE.
(exhales)

09:27.250 --> 09:29.291
MICHELLE, DOES THIS KIND
OF THING HAPPEN OFTEN,

09:29.333 --> 09:31.083
DARREN HITTING TAMMY,

09:31.125 --> 09:33.083
HITTING YOU?

09:33.125 --> 09:35.458
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.458
I WANT TO SEE MY DAUGHTER.

09:37.500 --> 09:40.041
MICHELLE, LOOK, I KNOW
THIS IS HARD TO TALK ABOUT,

09:40.083 --> 09:42.041
BUT YOU STABBED YOUR HUSBAND.

09:42.083 --> 09:44.041
NOW IF YOU WERE
PROTECTING TAMMY,

09:44.083 --> 09:47.875
IF THIS WAS SELF-DEFENSE--
GOD, YOU'RE MAKING US
SOUND LIKE...

09:47.917 --> 09:51.667
IT WAS NOT LIKE THAT.
DARREN DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO MAKE EXCUSES.

09:51.709 --> 09:53.500
I WAS COOKING...

09:53.542 --> 09:55.500
AND DARREN AND I
STARTED ARGUING.

09:55.542 --> 09:57.750
TAMMY TRIED TO STOP US,

09:57.792 --> 10:00.667
AND SHE GOT IN THE WAY,
AND DARREN PUSHED HER.

10:00.709 --> 10:03.417
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
BUT I GOT MAD

10:03.458 --> 10:07.125
AND I OVERREACTED
AND I HAD A KNIFE IN MY HAND.

10:07.166 --> 10:11.667
PLEASE. I NEED TO BE WITH TAMMY.
I NEED TO MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY.
OKAY, OKAY.

10:11.709 --> 10:14.041
(police radio chatter)

10:14.083 --> 10:17.041
MICHELLE LARSEN. WE HAVE
A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.625
WHAT? NO, NO. NO, OFFICER.
HER HUSBAND HIT HER.

10:19.667 --> 10:21.250
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

10:21.291 --> 10:24.041
OKAY, MICHELLE. NO, LOOK, SHE
HAS A DAUGHTER WHO NEEDS HER.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.125
SHE'S PREGNANT.
SHE HAS A HEAD CONTUSION.

10:26.166 --> 10:29.041
SHE NEEDS MEDICAL CARE.
THEN ADMIT HER UPSTAIRS
TO THE MEDICAL JAIL WARD,

10:29.083 --> 10:31.583
BUT HER HUSBAND HAS A KNIFE
WOUND, AND SHE'S UNDER ARREST.
MOM?

10:31.625 --> 10:33.875
DO NOT HANDCUFF HER
IN FRONT OF HER DAUGHTER.
(Cooper) WHAT IS HAPPENING?

10:33.917 --> 10:36.542
TAMMY, IT'S OKAY.
SHE'S TRAUMATIZED ENOUGH.
COOPER, GET HER OUT OF HERE.

10:36.583 --> 10:37.875
NO! I WANT TO STAY
WITH MOM!
NO, NO, NO. TAMMY, TAMMY--

10:37.917 --> 10:40.041
EVERYTHING'S OKAY, SWEETIE.
I LOVE YOU.
MOM!

10:40.083 --> 10:42.000
I LOVE YOU, SWEETIE.
I LOVE YOU.
TAMMY.

10:46.291 --> 10:48.291
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE UP
A HOSPITAL BED

10:48.333 --> 10:51.041
FOR A KID
WITH A BROKEN ARM?
SHE'S 10 YEARS OLD,
HER DAD HIT HER,

10:51.083 --> 10:54.000
SHE JUST WATCHED HER MOM
GET HAULED OFF BY THE COPS.
ALL GOOD MATERIAL
FOR A COUNTRY SONG,

10:54.041 --> 10:56.041
BUT LOUSY
ON A MEDICAL REPORT.

10:56.083 --> 10:58.041
YOU LOOK LIKE
DAY-OLD DISHWATER, COOP.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.583
WHY DON'T YOU GO GRAB A SHOWER,
GET SOME REST?

11:00.625 --> 11:02.500
YOU'VE DONE ALL YOU CAN HERE.
NO, SHE'S MY PATIENT,

11:02.542 --> 11:04.500
AND I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

11:04.542 --> 11:07.208
I COULD'VE STOPPED THIS.
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO VIOLET'S
TO GET YOUR STUFF?

11:07.250 --> 11:09.208
OH, CHARLOTTE, COME ON.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HER?

11:09.250 --> 11:11.375
THIS IS NOT ABOUT VIOLET,
OKAY?

11:11.417 --> 11:14.083
I HAVEN'T SHAVED AND MY SHIRT'S
A LITTLE WRINKLED,

11:14.125 --> 11:18.083
BUT BENEATH THE DEPRESSED
HOBO LOOK, I AM FINE.
YOU'RE FINE? YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
VIOLET SINCE SHE GOT HOME.

11:18.125 --> 11:20.083
YOU LIVE WITH HER
FOR SIX MONTHS,

11:20.125 --> 11:23.166
NOW YOU WON'T EVEN
PICK UP A CLEAN SHIRT?

11:23.208 --> 11:26.041
YOU WON'T TALK ABOUT IT.
LIKE YOU TALK ABOUT
YOU GETTING FIRED?

11:26.083 --> 11:29.333
I'M DOING MY JOB, COOPER--
THE ONE I HAVE LEFT.

11:29.375 --> 11:33.125
MY PROBLEMS AREN'T GETTING
IN THE WAY OF THAT.
(scoffs)
I HAVE A PATIENT.

11:33.166 --> 11:37.041
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

11:37.083 --> 11:39.333
(woman) ECHO IS NOW
A GRAND OLD MATRIARCH,

11:39.375 --> 11:41.333
HER CROSSED TUSKS
MAKE HER UNMISTAKABLE.

11:41.375 --> 11:42.959
(telephone rings)

11:43.000 --> 11:44.333
(elephant trumpets)

11:44.375 --> 11:46.125
(rings and beeps)

11:46.166 --> 11:48.542
HELLO.
VIOLET, YOU'RE THERE.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.250
YEAH. WELL, THAT'S HOW
THE TELEPHONE WORKS.

11:51.291 --> 11:53.250
YOU CALL PEOPLE.
THEY ANSWER. YOU SPEAK.

11:53.291 --> 11:56.125
RIGHT. UH, LOOK, I WAS JUST
CALLING TO REMIND YOU

11:56.166 --> 11:58.625
THAT IF LUCAS CAN'T SLEEP,
GIVE HIM THE SHEEP TOY.

11:58.667 --> 12:01.041
AND HE LIKES THE RAIN SOUND,
BUT NOT THE WHALE CALLS.

12:01.083 --> 12:05.417
UH, WELL, NOBODY LIKES
THE WHALE CALLS. THEY'RE EERIE.
YOU'RE CHECKING UP ON ME.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.834
YEAH. I WAS HOPING
YOU'D BE OUT.

12:07.875 --> 12:11.458
WELL, LUCAS IS SLEEPING NOW,
SO, UH, I BETTER GO.

12:11.500 --> 12:15.166
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--
SLEEP WHILE THE BABY SLEEPS.
(telephone beeps)

12:15.208 --> 12:17.583
(cell phone beeps)

12:17.625 --> 12:19.041
(paper rustling)

12:19.083 --> 12:21.166
THE LARSENS?
MY LARSENS?

12:21.208 --> 12:24.208
YEAH. WELL, MY LARSENS NOW.

12:24.250 --> 12:27.458
(closes trunk)
WELL, WHEN MICHELLE
CAME TO ME,

12:27.500 --> 12:31.041
SHE AND DARREN WANTED A SIBLING
SO BADLY FOR TAMMY.
(car alarm chirps)

12:31.083 --> 12:34.041
WHEN THEY FINALLY GOT PREGNANT,
THEY SEEMED SO--
SO HAPPY, I KNOW.

12:34.083 --> 12:37.041
YEAH.
HEY, LISTEN, THANKS FOR
COMING WITH ME TODAY.

12:37.083 --> 12:39.625
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WANTED TO SEE VIOLET,

12:39.667 --> 12:42.625
AND THIS GIVES US
A CHANCE TO HANG OUT.
YEAH.

12:42.667 --> 12:45.625
YEAH. THINGS HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE AWKWARD, YOU KNOW?

12:45.667 --> 12:47.625
WELL, NO.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.709
IT'S JUST, UH...

12:49.750 --> 12:52.667
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU...
OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICE.

12:52.709 --> 12:54.041
YEAH.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.875
YEAH.

12:57.875 --> 12:59.917
NO. MNH-MNH.

12:59.959 --> 13:04.041
APPARENTLY...
THERE'S A CLOSET SITUATION.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.041
(clears throat)

13:06.083 --> 13:08.667
VIOLET.
HEY, IT'S ME.

13:08.709 --> 13:11.709
UH, NAI AND I ARE OUTSIDE.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.959
(jangles and clatters)

13:14.000 --> 13:15.917
OKAY.
(cell phone beeps)

13:18.417 --> 13:20.625
HELLO?

13:22.208 --> 13:24.041
VI?

13:24.083 --> 13:26.250
COULD YOU--COULD YOU SHUT
THE FRONT DOOR, PLEASE?

13:26.291 --> 13:28.083
AND--AND LOCK IT.

13:28.125 --> 13:31.041
BOTH LOCKS.

13:31.083 --> 13:32.875
(locks click)

13:32.917 --> 13:34.792
IT'S CLOSED AND LOCKED.
OKAY.

13:34.834 --> 13:36.875
(doorknob clicks)

13:36.917 --> 13:38.542
HEY, YOU GUYS.

13:38.583 --> 13:39.542
HI.

13:39.583 --> 13:42.041
IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU. HI.

13:42.083 --> 13:44.625
OH. OH, MY GOD,
YOU BROUGHT FOOD. YOU'RE GODS.

13:44.667 --> 13:47.041
HI.
HI.

13:47.083 --> 13:49.750
(Lucas crying)

13:49.792 --> 13:51.083
OH...

13:51.125 --> 13:53.834
MY GOD.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.583
HI.

13:55.625 --> 13:59.917
OH, LOOK AT THESE
TINY HANDS. HI.

13:59.959 --> 14:04.166
OH, BABY SMELL.
I LOVE BABY SMELL.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.709
IT'S LIKE HEROIN.

14:06.750 --> 14:10.041
AWW.
YES. THIS IS MAKING
MY UTERUS HURT.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.542
OH.
HELLO, SWEETIE.

14:11.583 --> 14:13.041
OH.
HI.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.208
YEAH.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.333
(laughs) HE'S ADORABLE.

14:16.375 --> 14:17.542
YEAH.

14:17.583 --> 14:19.166
HI, SWEETIE.

14:19.208 --> 14:22.125
I GET THAT YOU THINK
I'M A MONSTER.

14:22.166 --> 14:26.250
BUT THE THING IS, I SWEAR, SAM,
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

14:26.291 --> 14:29.125
YOU GET MEDICAL CARE FROM ME.
YOU DON'T GET SYMPATHY.

14:29.166 --> 14:32.041
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR
YOUR SYMPATHY. I FEEL TERRIBLE.

14:32.083 --> 14:34.375
IT'S NOT THAT.
I'M A GOOD MAN.

14:34.417 --> 14:36.041
STOP TALKING.

14:36.083 --> 14:39.333
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN?

14:39.375 --> 14:43.333
YOU LIKE TO HIT WOMEN.
YOU LIKE TO HIT CHILDREN.

14:43.375 --> 14:45.333
THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU GOOD

14:45.375 --> 14:48.375
AND IT SURE AS HELL DOESN'T MAKE
YOU A MAN, SO STOP TALKING.

14:48.417 --> 14:50.375
OKAY, I'M--I'M A GOOD MAN.

14:50.417 --> 14:53.375
AND IF YOU SAY ONE MORE WORD,
I MIGHT HAVE TO SHOW YOU

14:53.417 --> 14:56.041
WHAT THIS GOOD MAN DOES
TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

14:56.083 --> 14:59.041
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:59.083 --> 15:01.041
DR. BENNETT,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO REIN IN

15:01.083 --> 15:03.250
THAT CHARMING BEDSIDE MANNER.

15:03.291 --> 15:05.875
TRUST ME,
I WAS REINING IT IN.
(monitor beeping erratically)

15:05.917 --> 15:07.250
(grunting)
HE'S SEIZING.

15:07.291 --> 15:08.667
DARREN?

15:08.709 --> 15:11.917
I NEED SUCTION
AND AN AIRWAY NOW.
(groaning)

15:16.041 --> 15:18.000
YOUR INCISION
IS HEALING WELL.

15:18.041 --> 15:21.208
JUST KEEP THE AREA,
YOU KNOW, CLEAN AND DRY.
OKAY.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.542
ANYTHING ELSE?

15:23.583 --> 15:26.542
NO. YES. UM...

15:26.583 --> 15:30.041
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GET
SOME LIGHT EXERCISE.

15:30.083 --> 15:32.417
JUST GO WALK AROUND
THE BLOCK OR SOMETHING.

15:32.458 --> 15:35.041
YOU KNOW, JUST GET OUT.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.542
WOW.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.291
YOUR--YOUR LIPS ARE MOVING,

15:38.333 --> 15:40.291
BUT YOUR WORDS
SOUND JUST LIKE PETE'S.

15:40.333 --> 15:44.125
YOU WERE IN THE CLOSET,
VIOLET.

15:44.166 --> 15:46.125
LOOK, I'M...

15:46.166 --> 15:48.625
(voice breaks) I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN.

15:48.667 --> 15:52.041
NO, I KNOW YOU ARE. I DO.
(Naomi)
OH, LOOK AT THAT SMILE.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.333
THAT'S GAS.

15:54.375 --> 15:56.041
SORRY TO TELL YOU.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.959
NO, IT IS NOT GAS.
THIS IS A SMILE.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.542
YES, IT IS, 'CAUSE YOU LOVE
YOUR AUNTIE NAI, DON'T YOU?

16:02.583 --> 16:04.041
OH.

16:04.083 --> 16:06.125
OH, ISN'T HE BEAUTIFUL?

16:06.166 --> 16:09.041
WHEN MAYA WAS LITTLE, I USED
TO JUST WATCH HER BREATHE.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.041
ISN'T THIS THE BEST?
SURE.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.250
I AM HOGGING THE BABY.
I'M SORRY. WHO WANTS HIM?

16:13.291 --> 16:14.875
IT'S ADDISON'S TURN.

16:14.917 --> 16:16.542
OH, GO, GO, GO.
YES.

16:16.583 --> 16:19.041
BUT YOU'RE COMING BACK
TO ME.
HELLO, LUCAS.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.792
(gasps) HE DID JUST SMILE.

16:20.834 --> 16:23.000
HE SMILED.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.917
WOW, THIS PLACE
LOOKS DIFFERENT.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.375
PETE... I'M SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU HERE.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.375
UNLESS YOU'RE
MY 2:15 APPOINTMENT,

16:37.417 --> 16:39.000
IN WHICH CASE,

16:39.041 --> 16:41.083
I'M GLAD YOU'RE FINALLY DEALING
WITH YOUR KLEPTOMANIA.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.500
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY.
YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY.
(chuckles)

16:43.542 --> 16:45.917
LOOK, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT VIOLET.

16:45.959 --> 16:48.041
ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS A GOOD TIME?

16:48.083 --> 16:50.041
OKAY, I'VE BEEN
A LITTLE OVERPROTECTIVE.

16:50.083 --> 16:53.291
YOU MEAN TERRITORIAL.
WHATEVER PSYCHOLOGICAL TERM
YOU WANT TO USE IS FINE.

16:53.333 --> 16:56.041
I'M NOT HERE TO ARGUE
WITH YOU.
I TOLD YOU WHEN YOU
BROUGHT HER HOME

16:56.083 --> 16:58.500
FROM THE HOSPITAL TO HER HOME,
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

16:58.542 --> 17:01.500
SHE WASN'T READY
TO FACE THE TRAUMA.
GOING BACK TO THAT HOUSE
IS WHAT VIOLET WANTED.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.542
YOU TRY
TELLING HER WHAT TO DO.

17:03.583 --> 17:06.458
I'D LIKE TO, BUT I HAVEN'T HAD
THE CHANCE. YOU'RE HANDLING IT.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.583
I NEED YOUR HELP.

17:11.417 --> 17:13.375
I'LL STOP BY THIS AFTERNOON.

17:13.417 --> 17:16.458
THANK YOU.
I WAS EYEING THAT APPLE.

17:29.041 --> 17:31.417
THE PRESSURE IN HIS BRAIN
IS STILL NOT COMING DOWN.

17:31.458 --> 17:33.041
CONTINUE THE MANNITOL

17:33.083 --> 17:36.166
AND HYPERVENTILATE HIM
TO A P.C.0.2 OF 35.

17:36.208 --> 17:40.208
(sighs) HEY.
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:40.250 --> 17:42.208
CEREBRAL CONTUSION.
HE WOULDN'T STOP SEIZING.

17:42.250 --> 17:44.417
I HAD TO INDUCE
A BARBITURATE COMA.

17:44.458 --> 17:47.166
NEURO PUT
A PRESSURE MONITOR IN,

17:47.208 --> 17:49.166
BUT I CAN'T GET
THE PRESSURE TO COME DOWN.

17:49.208 --> 17:50.792
SO HE MAY DIE?

17:50.834 --> 17:53.667
YEAH. LITTLE BIT OF JUSTICE.
I'M JUST SAYING.

17:53.709 --> 17:56.792
SAM, IF HE DIES...

17:56.834 --> 17:58.583
MICHELLE COULD BE CHARGED
WITH MURDER.

17:58.625 --> 18:00.667
AND WHAT, TAMMY HAS
A FATHER WHO'S DEAD

18:00.709 --> 18:02.583
AND A MOTHER IN JAIL?

18:02.625 --> 18:05.583
ALL RIGHT, WELL, NOW YOU'RE
JUST MAKING ME FEEL BAD,

18:05.625 --> 18:07.875
SO STOP IT.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.959
MICHELLE, IF YOU DON'T
TELL THE TRUTH NOW,

18:10.000 --> 18:11.333
YOU'LL GO TO JAIL.

18:11.375 --> 18:14.250
I AM.
I JUST DON'T BUY IT.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.500
YOU'RE STILL TRYING TO
PROTECT SOME IMAGE

18:16.542 --> 18:19.041
THAT YOU HAVE OF YOUR FAMILY
OR OF DARREN.

18:19.083 --> 18:20.625
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT,

18:20.667 --> 18:22.625
AND IF HE DIES,

18:22.667 --> 18:25.083
YOU WILL BE CHARGED
WITH MANSLAUGHTER OR WORSE.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.083
YOU HAVE TO STOP
PROTECTING HIM,

18:27.125 --> 18:30.041
IF NOT FOR YOURSELF,
THEN FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

18:30.083 --> 18:32.291
THINK ABOUT TAMMY.
I AM.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.959
(voice breaks) I AM
THINKING ABOUT MY DAUGHTER.

18:39.125 --> 18:41.709
TAMMY, WE HAVE
SOME HARD STUFF...

18:41.750 --> 18:44.667
TO TALK ABOUT.

18:44.709 --> 18:46.917
YOUR DAD IS IN A COMA.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.041
FROM BEING STABBED?
HE HIT HIS HEAD.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.333
AND DR. BENNETT'S
TAKING CARE OF HIM.

18:51.375 --> 18:53.291
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING
THAT WE CAN.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.375
LOOK, I KNOW
THIS IS REALLY HARD

18:55.417 --> 18:58.083
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT,

18:58.125 --> 19:00.250
AND BELIEVE ME,
I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.583
BUT YOUR MOM'S IN TROUBLE
WITH THE POLICE,

19:02.625 --> 19:06.083
AND I DON'T WANT HER
TO BE IN MORE TROUBLE.

19:06.125 --> 19:08.083
AND THIS SHOULD NOT BE
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY,

19:08.125 --> 19:10.917
BUT SHE SAYS
THAT IT'S ALL HER FAULT,

19:10.959 --> 19:12.917
WHAT HAPPENED, AND...

19:12.959 --> 19:14.917
WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE HER.

19:14.959 --> 19:19.750
AND... IF YOU TOLD THE POLICE
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED...

19:21.959 --> 19:23.834
WELL...

19:23.875 --> 19:27.041
I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.333
BUT IT WASN'T?

19:29.375 --> 19:31.709
NO.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.750
NO.

19:33.792 --> 19:36.083
TAMMY, LOOK,
WHATEVER YOUR DAD DID--

19:36.125 --> 19:38.041
IT WASN'T HIM.

19:38.083 --> 19:39.208
(sighs)

19:39.250 --> 19:42.208
I WAS CUTTING A CANTALOUPE,
AND MY DAD CAME IN.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.500
HE STARTED SINGING
WITH THE RADIO.

19:44.542 --> 19:46.041
HE WAS BEING FUNNY,

19:46.083 --> 19:47.625
BUT I GOT SO MAD.

19:47.667 --> 19:50.667
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
IT JUST COMES OVER ME.

19:50.709 --> 19:52.667
MY DAD COULD SEE
IT WAS HAPPENING.

19:52.709 --> 19:55.959
HE HELD ME TO CALM ME DOWN,
BUT I BIT HIM.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.959
AND HE YELLED FOR MY MOM,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.333
AND THEY BOTH
TRIED TO STOP ME.

20:00.375 --> 20:04.667
I HAD THE KNIFE IN MY HAND,
SO I STABBED HIM.

20:04.709 --> 20:06.750
(sighs)

20:06.792 --> 20:10.333
(voice breaks)
AND NOW HE'S GONNA DIE.

20:18.250 --> 20:21.000
I SEE
YOU HAVE A NEW RUG.

20:22.625 --> 20:25.291
PETE TELLS ME YOU'RE AFRAID
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.500
I SAID THAT YOU COULD
COME SEE THE BABY,

20:27.542 --> 20:31.083
NOT SHRINK MY BRAIN.
YOUR BODY LANGUAGE IS TELLING ME
THAT YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE.

20:31.125 --> 20:33.417
MY VOCAL LANGUAGE IS
TELLING YOU THAT I'M FINE.

20:33.458 --> 20:36.041
REALLY.
COULD YOU BE DEFLECTING
RIGHT NOW?

20:36.083 --> 20:39.625
NOT VERY EFFECTIVELY.
(Lucas coos)

20:39.667 --> 20:41.625
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, SHELDON?

20:41.667 --> 20:45.083
I WANT YOU TO TALK ABOUT
HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

20:45.125 --> 20:47.709
DO YOU WANT TO HOLD
THE BABY OR NOT?

20:47.750 --> 20:49.583
YES.

20:49.625 --> 20:52.875
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
VIOLET. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.709
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.750
LOOK AT THIS GUY.

20:56.792 --> 20:58.000
(coos)

21:00.583 --> 21:03.417
DO YOU MIND WATCHING HIM?

21:03.458 --> 21:06.041
I COULD REALLY USE
A SHOWER.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.458
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK,
VIOLET.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.458
I'M A PROFESSIONAL PSYCHIATRIST.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.834
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CONFUSE ME
WITH A BABY.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.959
AND I THINK YOU HAVE MY EARS.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.667
(chuckles)
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

21:20.709 --> 21:22.917
(coos)
(laughs) YEAH, I AM.

21:22.959 --> 21:26.250
NO. NO, NO. SHE TOLD YOU?
NO, NO, SHE CAN'T TAKE

21:26.291 --> 21:28.875
THE BLAME FOR THIS, PLEASE.
CAN YOU GIVE US A MOMENT,
PLEASE? THANK YOU.

21:28.917 --> 21:32.000
NO, WHAT ARE THEY
GONNA DO TO HER?
THEY'RE GONNA TRY
TO GET HER SOME HELP.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.750
DON'T YOU THINK WE'VE TRIED?
MICHELLE, I UNDERSTAND
THE URGE TO LIE,

21:34.792 --> 21:37.750
TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY,
BUT WE COULDN'T LET YOU SAY

21:37.792 --> 21:40.750
THAT IT WAS YOUR FAULT
WHEN IT WASN'T.
BUT IT IS.
IT IS MY FAULT.

21:40.792 --> 21:42.959
I WAS ON DRUGS
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WITH HER,

21:43.000 --> 21:44.917
FOR THE FIRST COUPLE
OF MONTHS,

21:44.959 --> 21:47.041
BEFORE I KNEW
I WAS CARRYING HER.
MICHELLE--

21:47.083 --> 21:49.583
YOU WEREN'T THERE.
YOU DON'T KNOW, BUT I KNOW.

21:49.625 --> 21:52.000
SHE HAD A.D.H.D.
BECAUSE OF WHAT I DID,

21:52.041 --> 21:53.875
AND THEN THESE RAGES STARTED.

21:53.917 --> 21:55.959
SHE HAS THEM OVER NOTHING.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.959
AND SOMEONE TOLD YOU
THAT HER BEHAVIOR

21:58.000 --> 22:00.041
WAS RELATED
TO YOUR DRUG USE?

22:00.083 --> 22:02.041
THE SCHOOL COUNSELOR SAID
THAT IT'S ADOLESCENCE,

22:02.083 --> 22:04.500
BUT I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

22:04.542 --> 22:08.083
I'VE READ ENOUGH, AND SHE'S
BEEN TESTED AND TESTED AND...

22:08.125 --> 22:10.000
AND THERE'S NOTHING ELSE.

22:10.041 --> 22:12.208
IT'S ME.

22:12.250 --> 22:13.917
MICHELLE...

22:13.959 --> 22:17.166
LOOK, I KNOW
THAT YOU FEEL GUILTY

22:17.208 --> 22:19.166
AND THAT YOU FEEL HURT

22:19.208 --> 22:22.166
AND THAT YOU WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO CHANGE WHAT HAPPENED,

22:22.208 --> 22:24.792
TO CHANGE HOW YOU'RE FEELING
RIGHT NOW.

22:24.834 --> 22:29.375
BUT SOMETIMES... YOU JUST
HAVE TO PUSH FORWARD.

22:29.417 --> 22:33.000
DARREN IS THE STRONG ONE.
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

22:33.041 --> 22:35.083
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
ALL OF THIS TOGETHER,

22:35.125 --> 22:37.542
AND WITHOUT HIM,
I CAN'T DO IT. I CAN'T.

22:37.583 --> 22:40.041
HE'S IN A COMA,
AND THEN...

22:40.083 --> 22:43.583
(sobbing) TAMMY'S GONNA BE
TAKEN AWAY.

22:45.792 --> 22:48.750
I'M JUST LOSING
EVERYONE I LOVE.

(Katie Costello's

22:56.208 --> 22:58.959

FENCING MATCH,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.583
AND I LOST.

23:01.625 --> 23:03.583
SHE DISTRACTED ME
WITH THE BABY,

23:03.625 --> 23:06.917
WHO IS QUITE WINNING
AND HAS MY EARS.
THEY'RE MY EARS.

23:06.959 --> 23:10.583
WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW?
CAN I MAKE AN OBSERVATION?

23:10.625 --> 23:12.583
I DON'T KNOW. CAN YOU?

23:12.625 --> 23:17.041

SO I'M JUST GONNA IGNORE THAT.

A TOUGH COUPLE OF DAYS.

29:16.041 --> 29:17.417

29:17.458 --> 29:18.625
YEAH.

29:18.667 --> 29:20.667
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

29:20.709 --> 29:24.041
UH, NO, NO. UH, IT'S--
IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

29:24.083 --> 29:26.083
I'M GONNA GET BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

29:26.125 --> 29:28.333

29:28.375 --> 29:31.041
HEY!
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

29:31.083 --> 29:33.083
HEY, NAI.
I'M JUST REALLY BUSY.

29:33.125 --> 29:35.041
OH. THIS LARSEN THING?

29:35.083 --> 29:38.250
YEAH. I'M WAITING ON THE RESULTS
OF AN ABDOMINAL M.R.I.

29:38.291 --> 29:40.250
FOR MICHELLE?
I THOUGHT SHE WAS FINE.

29:40.291 --> 29:42.667
NO, FOR TAMMY.

29:42.709 --> 29:45.500
OH, BUT I THOUGHT THAT--
(pager beeps)

29:45.542 --> 29:48.208
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

29:48.250 --> 29:52.250
I-I CAN'T TELL YOU EVERYTHING
ALL THE TIME, NAI.

29:56.834 --> 30:00.041
I LIKE GIN.
GIN IS GOOD.

30:00.083 --> 30:02.917
GIN IS GOOD.

30:04.625 --> 30:06.041
SO...

30:06.083 --> 30:08.000
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YA?

30:08.041 --> 30:11.041
I MEAN, OTHER THAN THE WHOLE
"PSYCHO CHOPPED THE BABY

30:11.083 --> 30:13.083

OTHER THAN THAT?

30:17.083 --> 30:19.041

30:19.083 --> 30:22.583

30:22.625 --> 30:25.041
OH. I GET IT.

30:25.083 --> 30:27.125
YOU DON'T WANT
TO OPEN UP TO ME.

30:27.166 --> 30:30.041
I KNOW. I'M NOT
THE TOUCHY-FEELY TYPE.

30:30.083 --> 30:32.333
I GOT FIRED
FOR BEING HEARTLESS.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.583
COOPER APPARENTLY AGREES.

30:37.625 --> 30:40.583
MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

30:50.125 --> 30:52.500
IT'S THE BABY.

30:52.542 --> 30:54.750
HE HAVE 11 TOES
OR SOMETHING?

30:54.792 --> 30:56.792
OH, NO. NO, HE'S--
HE'S PERFECT.

30:56.834 --> 30:58.792
HE'S ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

30:58.834 --> 31:00.875
HE'S THE BABY
IN THE COMMERCIAL,

31:00.917 --> 31:02.792
HE'S SO PERFECT.

31:02.834 --> 31:07.625
AND I-I LOOK AT HIM,
AND I FEEL...

31:07.667 --> 31:09.834
NOTHING.

31:09.875 --> 31:12.041
I CAN'T...

31:12.083 --> 31:14.542
FEEL ANYTHING...

31:14.583 --> 31:17.542
EVER SINCE THE...

31:17.583 --> 31:21.041
I MEAN, THERE'S THIS PRESSURE
TO BE ALL "MOMMY,"

31:21.083 --> 31:23.583
AND I'M JUST--I'M NOT.

31:23.625 --> 31:25.583
I'M NOT READY OR SOMETHING.

31:25.625 --> 31:28.583
I JUST--I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH HIM.

31:28.625 --> 31:31.583
I JUST WANT TO... STICK HIM
IN THE FREEZER.

31:31.625 --> 31:33.166
MAYBE THAW HIM OUT LATER

31:33.208 --> 31:35.166
WHEN I'M READY
TO DEAL WITH HIM.

31:35.208 --> 31:38.417
THAT'S A--THAT'S A HORRIBLE
THING TO SAY, ISN'T IT?
YES.

31:38.458 --> 31:41.166
OH.

31:41.208 --> 31:44.041
BUT THE HORRIBLE THINGS
THEY'RE...

31:44.083 --> 31:48.041
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE SAID.

31:48.083 --> 31:50.041
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

31:50.083 --> 31:52.583
SHOOT.
WHERE THE HELL IS COOPER?

31:52.625 --> 31:55.583
HE'S BUSY SAVING A PATIENT,

31:55.625 --> 31:58.500
TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR THE FACT
THAT HE DIDN'T SAVE YOU.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.875
WHAT?

32:00.917 --> 32:04.041
IS HE...
BLAMING HIMSELF FOR--

32:04.083 --> 32:07.917
EXCEPT FOR THE PART
HE BLAMES ON ME.

32:07.959 --> 32:10.208
I CALLED HIM THAT NIGHT.

32:10.250 --> 32:14.000
I WAS THE REASON HE DIDN'T
WALK IN THAT DOOR AND SAVE YOU.

32:25.667 --> 32:27.667
I GUESS YOU OWE ME.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.041
(Addison) TAMMY HAS
A VERY RARE TUMOR ON HER OVARY

32:33.083 --> 32:35.208
CALLED AN ECTOPIC
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA.

32:35.250 --> 32:38.542
IT INTERMITTENTLY RELEASES
AN EXCESS OF ADRENALINE,

32:38.583 --> 32:42.291
CAUSING A RISE IN HEART RATE,
BLOOD PRESSURE,

32:42.333 --> 32:47.458
ALL LEADING TO FEAR, ANGER
AND TAMMY'S SUDDEN RAGES.

32:47.500 --> 32:50.041
AND, MICHELLE, NOTHING
THAT YOU DID OR DO NOT DO

32:50.083 --> 32:53.667
DURING PREGNANCY CAUSED THIS.
BUT WE FOUND IT,
WHICH MEANS WE CAN FIX IT.

32:53.709 --> 32:56.875
YEAH, I CAN REMOVE IT
LAPAROSCOPICALLY.
WITHOUT THE NEED
FOR A LARGE INCISION.

32:56.917 --> 32:59.792
WHICH MEANS THAT ALL THOSE MOODS
THAT YOU'VE BEEN FEELING,

32:59.834 --> 33:03.125
THEY SHOULD STOP.
(Michelle) ALL THIS TIME,
I'VE BEEN BLAMING MYSELF.

33:03.166 --> 33:05.250
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

33:05.291 --> 33:07.458
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.250
BUT DAD ISN'T.

33:09.291 --> 33:12.834
BUT YOU CANNOT FEEL GUILTY FOR
SOMETHING YOU COULDN'T CONTROL.

33:12.875 --> 33:14.834
BUT I DO.

33:14.875 --> 33:17.709
AND TAKING OUT THIS TUMOR,
IT WON'T CHANGE THAT.

33:17.750 --> 33:22.000
IT WON'T CHANGE
THE WAY I FEEL.

33:23.959 --> 33:26.917
I'VE TRIED STEROIDS,
FLUID RESTRICTION.

33:26.959 --> 33:29.041
NOTHING'S WORKING.

33:29.083 --> 33:31.041
NEURO SAYS HE'S NOT
A SURGICAL CANDIDATE.

33:31.083 --> 33:33.500
I'M GONNA TAKE TAMMY
INTO SURGERY NOW.
OKAY.

33:33.542 --> 33:36.041
HOW'S SHE DOING?
SHE'LL BE FINE.

33:36.083 --> 33:38.917
YEAH, PHYSICALLY, BUT SHE
WILL NOT FORGIVE HERSELF,

33:38.959 --> 33:41.583
AND NOTHING I SAID
WAS GONNA GET HER...

33:41.625 --> 33:43.625
YOU GUYS THINK
THAT WHEN WE DIE,

33:43.667 --> 33:45.125
THERE'S LIKE A BOOKKEEPER,

33:45.166 --> 33:47.125
AND HE TALLIES UP
EVERYTHING WE DID--

33:47.166 --> 33:49.625
ALL THE LIVES WE SAVED,
ALL THE PEOPLE WE HELPED,

33:49.667 --> 33:52.750
AND IF WE'VE DONE ENOUGH GOOD
IN THE WORLD,

33:52.792 --> 33:56.333
THAT IT MAKES UP FOR THE TIMES
THAT WE JUST COMPLETELY FAIL?
NO. I DON'T THINK
ANYONE'S KEEPING SCORE.

WE HOPE FOR THE BEST,

40:54.542 --> 40:56.917
KATIE STOLE SOMETHING
FROM ME.

40:56.959 --> 40:59.959
SHE CHANGED ME, AND I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO CHANGE IT BACK.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.125
BUT I'M TRYING TO BE
A GOOD MOTHER, OKAY?

41:02.166 --> 41:03.250
OKAY.

41:03.291 --> 41:05.375
AND--AND YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

41:05.417 --> 41:07.000
IT'S NOT... IT'S...

41:07.041 --> 41:10.000
(voice breaking) IT'S NOT
JUST ABOUT YOU AND ME ANYMORE.

41:10.041 --> 41:12.000
AND BEING A GOOD MOTHER

41:12.041 --> 41:14.000
MEANS DOING WHAT'S BEST
FOR YOUR CHILD.

41:14.041 --> 41:16.000
AND YOU MAY NOT
UNDERSTAND THIS,

41:16.041 --> 41:19.000
AND YOU MAY NEVER...
FORGIVE ME FOR IT,

41:19.041 --> 41:21.291
BUT I...

41:21.333 --> 41:23.917
(crying) I WALKED OUT
THAT DOOR TONIGHT

41:23.959 --> 41:26.500
TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR LUCAS.

41:26.542 --> 41:30.041
THIS IS WHAT'S BEST
FOR LUCAS.

41:30.083 --> 41:33.041
YOU'RE WHAT'S BEST FOR LUCAS.
