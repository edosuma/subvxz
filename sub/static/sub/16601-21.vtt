What are you doing
in a parish church?

00:17.715 --> 00:20.246
You ever spend time in
one of your precinct houses?

00:20.425 --> 00:21.550
Sure.

00:21.551 --> 00:22.985
Have I answered your question?

00:22.986 --> 00:25.108
In your way.

00:25.128 --> 00:28.156
This an exercise in humility
or just for show?

00:28.157 --> 00:30.279
What good's humility
if you don't make a show of it?

00:30.758 --> 00:32.950
I mean,
how's anyone gonna notice?

00:33.418 --> 00:35.351
You're really
on your game today.

00:35.461 --> 00:37.324
I forget where
things stand with us

00:37.453 --> 00:39.017
at the, favor bank.

00:39.018 --> 00:40.342
Give me a break.

00:40.343 --> 00:43.003
You got the best institutional
memory in this city.

00:45.893 --> 00:47.984
The name John Macklin
mean anything to you?

00:47.985 --> 00:49.349
Not offhand.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.672
He was an altar boy
in my first parish.

00:51.682 --> 00:54.271
And then, worked at
the 5-7 in the Bronx.

00:54.272 --> 00:57.828
And I have been summoned here
to talk about him because...?

00:57.829 --> 01:00.688
He's got stage 4 cancer
of the trachea in the esophagus.

01:00.689 --> 01:03.777
The doctors told him
he's only got less than a month.

01:03.778 --> 01:06.507
He'll leave behind a wife
and four boys.

01:06.508 --> 01:08.500
I'll make time to go see him.

01:08.501 --> 01:10.562
The family feels
that he got the disease

01:10.563 --> 01:12.754
working on the pile after 9/11.

01:12.755 --> 01:15.376
What's the doctor say?

01:15.386 --> 01:17.378
You know how they are.

01:17.379 --> 01:19.301
Claim's gotten caught up
in red tape.

01:19.302 --> 01:21.294
And you think
the police commissioner

01:21.304 --> 01:23.256
can untangle it
and get this classified

01:23.257 --> 01:24.492
as a line of duty death.

01:24.493 --> 01:25.748
I hope so.

01:25.758 --> 01:29.145
You do know I get a lot
of requests like this.

01:29.146 --> 01:30.171
But not from me.

01:30.172 --> 01:32.403
Point taken.

01:32.404 --> 01:34.565
I'm just asking you
to give it a look,

01:34.566 --> 01:36.329
see what can be done to help.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.685
McLaughlin.

01:37.695 --> 01:40.683
Macklin. M-A-C-K.

01:40.684 --> 01:41.481
Got it.

01:41.482 --> 01:43.175
I'd be in your debt.

01:44.211 --> 01:47.260
No. We'd be even
because you would say

01:47.270 --> 01:48.794
I've been gifted
with the opportunity

01:48.795 --> 01:50.119
to serve my church.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.312
You know me too well.

01:52.322 --> 01:56.078
I don't think we're
in any danger of that.

02:03.222 --> 02:05.345
What do you say, Mullhearn?

02:05.355 --> 02:07.247
You know, working in
the property clerk's office,

02:07.248 --> 02:09.259
living the dream.

02:09.261 --> 02:11.263
Yeah, well, I called ahead.
I'm picking up the drug evidence

02:11.273 --> 02:13.165
for the Hickman case.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.590
The, Wall Street
drug courier thing?

02:14.591 --> 02:16.055
Yeah. Trial starts
this afternoon.

02:16.056 --> 02:17.481
So, let's get to it, all right?

02:17.491 --> 02:19.144
They said it'd be ready.

02:19.145 --> 02:21.206
All right, all right.

02:21.207 --> 02:23.140
I ain't got all day. All right.

02:25.033 --> 02:26.696
What the hell?

02:26.697 --> 02:28.152
There a problem?

02:28.162 --> 02:31.111
Well, there's ants
all over this thing.

02:31.121 --> 02:33.373
Who knew that they
liked heroin that much?

02:35.007 --> 02:38.325
They don't. They
like brown sugar.

02:38.335 --> 02:40.587
Someone's gotten into this.

02:40.597 --> 02:42.419
Hey, Anthony, don't look at me.
We've lost things before,

02:42.420 --> 02:44.482
but this is right where
it was supposed to be.

02:44.483 --> 02:46.944
Yeah, maybe so, but this
evidence has been tampered with.

02:58.283 --> 03:01.072
Hey! Police! Hey, break it up!

03:01.073 --> 03:02.069
Hey!

03:03.036 --> 03:04.291
It's over, it's over!

03:04.301 --> 03:06.990
Hey, calm down, calm down.

03:06.991 --> 03:09.013
Hey! It's over.

03:09.014 --> 03:10.846
You, what happened here?

03:10.847 --> 03:12.003
One minute, I'm behind
the counter, I'm filling orders,

03:12.013 --> 03:13.407
and the next,
these two are going at it

03:13.408 --> 03:15.361
like a couple of animals.
All right, what's up, guys?

03:15.371 --> 03:17.064
This lunatic
pulled a knife on me.

03:17.065 --> 03:18.827
Who you calling a lunatic?
You grabbed the knife first!

03:18.828 --> 03:20.920
What are you talking about?
You grabbed it! All right.

03:20.921 --> 03:22.444
All right, you boys need to
calm down or you're both getting

03:22.445 --> 03:23.740
locked up, you understand?

03:23.741 --> 03:25.036
This man tried to kill me.

03:25.046 --> 03:26.788
I want him charged
with murderous assault.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.532
Yeah, you mean felony assault.
However you say it,

03:28.533 --> 03:30.525
he's the mad dog.
He needs to be locked away!

03:30.526 --> 03:32.418
All right, both of you
need to calm down now.

03:32.419 --> 03:33.415
I want him charged!

03:33.416 --> 03:34.949
I want him charged, as well!

03:34.950 --> 03:37.969
All right, cuff 'em up.

03:37.979 --> 03:39.423
That's it, you're both

03:39.424 --> 03:40.868
going to jail.

03:43.858 --> 03:45.183
What the hell, Baez?

03:45.193 --> 03:47.414
Go around the block
for a hot dog,

03:47.415 --> 03:49.476
I come back, it's World War III.

03:49.477 --> 03:50.902
Male, white, with a gun,

03:50.912 --> 03:52.804
approximately 50-years-of-age,

03:52.805 --> 03:54.957
approached the female victim
while she was walking

03:54.967 --> 03:56.959
with her son
and just started shooting.

03:56.960 --> 03:57.956
And what about these two?

03:57.957 --> 03:59.350
Two male victims got shot

03:59.351 --> 04:01.413
trying to protect her.

04:01.414 --> 04:03.874
Both of them are likely.
She's not doing so good, either,

04:03.875 --> 04:06.136
but the EMTs think
she'll probably survive.

04:06.137 --> 04:07.890
Is she able to talk to us? Yeah.

04:07.900 --> 04:10.152
Excuse me.

04:10.162 --> 04:13.380
Miss? Detective Reagan,
this is Detective Baez.

04:13.381 --> 04:15.741
What can you tell us
about the man who shot you?

04:15.742 --> 04:18.800
Sergei, he's lost his mind.

04:18.801 --> 04:20.165
So you know him?

04:20.166 --> 04:23.184
He got a call. He wanted
me to go with him to Russia

04:23.185 --> 04:25.386
and leave my son. And when I...

04:25.387 --> 04:28.106
when I say no, he
gets his gun and...

04:28.107 --> 04:29.700
That's your little
boy over there?

04:29.701 --> 04:31.833
Okay, we're gonna
take care of him

04:31.834 --> 04:33.856
and you, all right? But first,

04:33.866 --> 04:35.619
you got to tell us
about this Sergei guy.

04:35.620 --> 04:36.816
All right, do you know
where he lives?

04:36.826 --> 04:38.648
Do you know
where we could find him?

04:38.649 --> 04:41.836
He-he could be anywhere. Please,

04:41.837 --> 04:44.727
I must tell you,

04:44.737 --> 04:48.791
he was with KGB and-and
Special Forces in Chechnya.

04:48.792 --> 04:50.884
We can handle him, all right?
Don't worry about us.

04:50.885 --> 04:53.175
No, no, you're not
understanding.

04:53.176 --> 04:55.268
They call him Rambo.

04:55.269 --> 04:58.725
He will kill anyone, any time.

04:58.726 --> 05:01.815
If you are lucky,

05:01.825 --> 05:04.246
you never find him.

05:32.245 --> 05:35.133
Three separate reviews
of Officer Macklin's claim

05:35.134 --> 05:36.727
are the same degree of muddy.

05:36.728 --> 05:38.591
About working the pile?

05:38.592 --> 05:40.852
No. He worked most days
for a good three weeks.

05:40.853 --> 05:42.676
Then, what's muddy?

05:42.677 --> 05:44.111
He drank like a fish,
smoked like a chimney.

05:44.112 --> 05:45.137
Okay.

05:45.138 --> 05:45.975
Well...

05:45.976 --> 05:48.227
Well what?

05:48.237 --> 05:50.489
As far as I'm concerned, if you
worked that pile and got sick,

05:50.499 --> 05:52.789
you and your family should be
taken care of, end of story.

05:52.790 --> 05:54.942
You're not
an insurance claims adjuster.

05:54.952 --> 05:56.476
For which,
I thank God every day.

05:56.477 --> 05:57.871
See that arms get twisted.

05:57.872 --> 05:59.137
Yes, sir.

06:03.860 --> 06:05.981
There's something else.

06:05.982 --> 06:08.811
We've got a problem off a brawl
in a bagel shop.

06:08.812 --> 06:11.134
The Archdiocese of
New York got involved.

06:11.144 --> 06:12.767
Catholic Church,
fight in a bagel shop?

06:12.768 --> 06:13.933
This is a joke, right?

06:13.934 --> 06:15.128
I wish.

06:15.129 --> 06:16.991
One of the cross-complainants

06:16.992 --> 06:19.851
is from an Iraqi Christian
family the Church sponsored

06:19.852 --> 06:21.645
to come over here.

06:21.646 --> 06:23.569
The Church bailed him out
on orders of the archbishop.

06:23.579 --> 06:26.467
Which is his right,
maybe even his duty.

06:26.468 --> 06:29.725
Maybe so. The other complainant
is a Muslim doctor

06:29.726 --> 06:31.459
from Sudan.

06:31.460 --> 06:33.203
His family's in a refugee camp.

06:33.204 --> 06:34.937
They're both here illegally,
both charged with felonies,

06:34.947 --> 06:36.740
which puts them on a list.

06:36.741 --> 06:38.533
Hey, not our problem.

06:38.534 --> 06:40.725
Frank, you met with
the archbishop.

06:40.726 --> 06:42.619
Not about this.

06:42.620 --> 06:43.815
The spin is
that you and the archbishop

06:43.825 --> 06:45.478
teamed up to
let the Christian go free.

06:45.479 --> 06:49.005
He didn't go free!
He made bail. I don't set bail.

06:49.006 --> 06:51.666
I'm not a judge.
It's not our problem.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.789
The mayor's very proud of
our status as a sanctuary city.

06:53.799 --> 06:55.452
He feels this dents that.

06:55.453 --> 06:56.887
Please.

06:56.888 --> 07:00.405
If the mayor wants to post bail
for the Muslim detainee,

07:00.415 --> 07:01.570
let him have at it.

07:01.571 --> 07:02.736
But I am the police commissioner

07:02.737 --> 07:05.426
of New York City,
not sanctuary city.

07:05.427 --> 07:06.891
We both knew this issue
would land on our desks

07:06.892 --> 07:08.226
sooner or later.

07:08.227 --> 07:09.950
It didn't just land.

07:09.951 --> 07:14.473
It was placed, by the mayor.
Get it off.

07:14.474 --> 07:15.838
Off what? Off my desk.

07:15.839 --> 07:17.731
How? I don't care how.

07:17.732 --> 07:20.353
Sure you do.
Start with City Hall,

07:20.363 --> 07:22.884
see if they got a sanctuary city
rug they can sweep it under.

07:27.706 --> 07:29.250
I don't see nothing.

07:29.251 --> 07:30.794
Come on, what do you mean
you don't see nothing?

07:30.795 --> 07:32.388
I mean, three people shot
right out

07:32.389 --> 07:34.251
in front of your place,
you didn't see any of it?

07:34.252 --> 07:36.345
We were very busy
with the customers.

07:36.355 --> 07:38.376
A dozen shots rang out.
You didn't hear anything?

07:38.377 --> 07:40.300
You didn't see which way
the shooter ran, nothing?

07:40.310 --> 07:41.735
I had lot of orders.

07:42.732 --> 07:44.555
<i>Bred kakoy to.</i>

07:44.565 --> 07:47.155
Wow, how much Russian
do you speak?

07:47.156 --> 07:50.214
That's all I know.
What do you know?

07:50.215 --> 07:52.535
Intel confirmed this
Rambo guy, Sergei Karenin,

07:52.536 --> 07:55.435
was here legally on
a diplomatic visa.

07:55.436 --> 07:56.889
The part about

07:56.890 --> 07:58.354
the KGB and the Special
Forces is true, as well.

07:58.355 --> 08:00.486
Where is he now?

08:00.487 --> 08:02.609
6-4 squad went to his apartment.
The place is cleared out.

08:02.610 --> 08:04.602
Car's abandoned,
his phone is dead.

08:04.612 --> 08:07.501
How do you say "in the wind"
in Russian?

08:07.502 --> 08:09.394
Well, somebody's got to be
helping him.

08:09.395 --> 08:10.919
I don't know, but, Danny,

08:10.929 --> 08:12.453
there's two detectives
from Moscow

08:12.454 --> 08:14.545
on their way here
to help with the investigation.

08:14.546 --> 08:17.275
Wait, what? Since when
do we work with the Russians?

08:17.276 --> 08:19.438
We don't even have
extradition with them.

08:19.439 --> 08:21.460
There's something called a
mutual legal assistance treaty.

08:21.461 --> 08:23.255
My God. Where we trade help

08:23.265 --> 08:24.550
with other cases.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.582
If we're looking for
someone over there,

08:26.583 --> 08:28.614
and the powers that be say we
should be trying to get along.

08:28.615 --> 08:30.369
Okay, but this just happened.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.102
You said those guys
are already on their way.

08:32.102 --> 08:33.229
How could that be?

08:33.239 --> 08:35.131
Yeah, hinky to me, too.

08:35.131 --> 08:37.721
All I know is that
we're supposed to cooperate.

08:37.722 --> 08:39.385
Ay-yi-yi.

08:47.367 --> 08:48.522
What's the matter?

08:48.523 --> 08:50.416
We got to talk now.

08:50.426 --> 08:52.049
Right now? It's important.

08:52.050 --> 08:54.362
I couldn't call ahead. You've
been in court the whole time.

08:56.375 --> 08:58.368
Ms. Reagan,
are we ready to proceed?

09:02.094 --> 09:04.185
Your Honor, may we approach?

09:04.186 --> 09:05.611
Yes.

09:11.032 --> 09:12.426
What's going on?

09:12.427 --> 09:14.060
We need a break.
We're having trouble

09:14.061 --> 09:16.322
putting our hands on
an exhibit for the case.

09:24.204 --> 09:26.157
Well, this is an epic mess.

09:26.167 --> 09:27.292
After three years,

09:27.293 --> 09:29.713
our key evidence is gone?

09:29.714 --> 09:32.144
I got our people up there
right now asking questions.

09:32.145 --> 09:34.207
Well, is it possible it's
just another clerical mistake?

09:34.208 --> 09:36.568
No way. It's the correct
weight for the drugs.

09:36.569 --> 09:39.059
Somebody deliberately
substituted brown sugar

09:39.060 --> 09:41.291
for the heroin so we
wouldn't notice the difference

09:41.292 --> 09:43.843
until the ants got in.

09:43.853 --> 09:46.123
Anthony, I don't even
know how many people

09:46.124 --> 09:48.405
put their hands on the evidence
before we inherited this case.

09:48.406 --> 09:50.099
Do we even have a paper trail?

09:50.100 --> 09:51.992
We're putting together
a list now.

09:51.993 --> 09:53.188
It's a lot of people.

09:53.189 --> 09:55.948
Okay, so Hickman
was providing drugs

09:55.949 --> 09:58.180
to a half dozen
Wall Street firms.

09:58.181 --> 10:01.298
Is it possible that someone
is paying big money

10:01.299 --> 10:03.192
to derail this case?

10:03.193 --> 10:05.086
Anything is possible,
including a mistrial.

10:05.096 --> 10:07.148
Erin, if this gets out...

10:07.158 --> 10:09.211
No, I know, we've got to
keep this on the DL for now.

10:09.221 --> 10:12.239
But, Anthony,
there's another crime here,

10:12.240 --> 10:14.202
and someone on our end

10:14.203 --> 10:17.162
is involved with it.

10:20.022 --> 10:21.714
You know what
this is about, right?

10:21.715 --> 10:23.279
A Christian and a Muslim
walk into a bagel store?

10:23.280 --> 10:24.903
The P.C.'s hands are tied.

10:24.904 --> 10:27.932
He can't just tell the D.A.
to release the other guy.

10:27.933 --> 10:29.446
We didn't suggest that.

10:29.447 --> 10:30.952
You suggested our department's
turning a blind eye.

10:30.962 --> 10:32.455
Trying to and failing.

10:32.456 --> 10:33.880
It's not our bailiwick.

10:33.881 --> 10:35.116
Until the P.C.'s good friend,

10:35.117 --> 10:37.109
the archbishop, weighed in.

10:37.110 --> 10:38.972
Reagan doesn't dictate
to the archdiocese.

10:38.973 --> 10:40.228
He has his ear, though.

10:40.238 --> 10:41.861
Well, he certainly didn't
in this matter.

10:41.862 --> 10:43.326
What are you looking
for here, Garrett?

10:43.327 --> 10:44.392
Cooperation,

10:44.393 --> 10:45.986
some ratcheting down
of the rhetoric.

10:45.987 --> 10:47.850
You guys are a broken
record when it comes to

10:47.851 --> 10:49.245
trashing One PP lately.

10:49.246 --> 10:51.108
You are barking up
the wrong tree on this.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.962
Being a sanctuary city

10:52.972 --> 10:54.864
is high on the mayor's list
of priorities.

10:54.865 --> 10:56.320
You mean it's high
on the list of what

10:56.330 --> 10:58.282
the mayor loves to see when
he's looking in the mirror.

10:58.283 --> 11:01.112
Look, we didn't open
this can of worms,

11:01.113 --> 11:02.606
that archbishop did.

11:02.607 --> 11:03.932
What are you saying,
I should counsel the P.C.

11:03.942 --> 11:05.934
to lean on the archbishop?

11:05.935 --> 11:07.827
Couldn't have said it better myself.
You know,

11:07.828 --> 11:10.089
it's this kind of politicizing
that doesn't help anyone.

11:10.090 --> 11:11.982
Maybe just once, you could
stand up for something

11:11.983 --> 11:14.076
other than saving your own hide.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.672
Are you coming
to poker on Sunday?

11:17.673 --> 11:20.064
I got a family thing.
I'll be half an hour late.

11:25.614 --> 11:27.875
Intel says these Russian
detectives are almost here.

11:27.876 --> 11:30.734
They are. In fact, their I.D.
pictures just came through.

11:30.735 --> 11:31.930
You ready? Yeah.

11:31.931 --> 11:34.022
Wow.

11:34.023 --> 11:36.085
That could be the new
Mr. Maria Baez.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.719
Shut up.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.124
I'm just saying.

11:39.125 --> 11:40.539
Let's take a look
at bachelor number two.

11:40.540 --> 11:43.230
Mr. December, from
the KGB pinup calendar.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.594
No.

11:44.595 --> 11:46.527
Putin taught him that smile
personally.

11:46.528 --> 11:48.790
You Reagan and Baez?

11:52.815 --> 11:54.807
You know, they're not
supposed to let you up here

11:54.808 --> 11:56.830
from the front desk
without an escort.

11:56.831 --> 12:00.617
We expedited procedure.
I'm Levin, this is Vronsky.

12:00.627 --> 12:01.722
Good to meet you.

12:01.723 --> 12:02.719
How was your flight?

12:02.720 --> 12:04.611
Long, boring.

12:04.612 --> 12:05.848
Ran out of vodka over Atlantic.

12:07.741 --> 12:09.185
Thank you.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.630
Now that we got the pleasantries

12:10.631 --> 12:12.024
out of the way,

12:12.025 --> 12:14.117
how is it that you guys
were on your way over here

12:14.118 --> 12:15.881
before this Rambo
even went crazy

12:15.882 --> 12:17.415
and started shooting people?

12:17.416 --> 12:19.767
First we eat,
then we discuss case.

12:19.777 --> 12:21.072
You want to go somewhere

12:21.073 --> 12:22.467
and have dinner?

12:22.468 --> 12:23.723
That would be better.
On the flight,

12:23.733 --> 12:25.725
they only had peanuts
and dry pretzels.

12:25.726 --> 12:27.120
Excuse me,

12:27.121 --> 12:29.481
there are two people dead
and one's in intensive care,

12:29.482 --> 12:31.574
so we don't give a damn
how hungry you are,

12:31.575 --> 12:32.999
we're in a hurry
to find this guy.

12:33.009 --> 12:35.699
We will eat, then we will drink,

12:35.700 --> 12:36.955
and then, we will find him.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.516
Okay. Let's get
one thing straight, okay?

12:39.526 --> 12:41.348
You're in our country now,

12:41.349 --> 12:43.540
which means
we're driving this thing

12:43.541 --> 12:44.975
and you're just along
for the ride.

12:44.976 --> 12:46.868
I don't think so, my friend.

12:46.869 --> 12:49.789
We have crucial information
to catch this man.

12:49.799 --> 12:51.890
Great, we'd love for you
to share it with us.

12:51.891 --> 12:54.610
Please. You cannot find him
without our assistance.

12:54.611 --> 12:57.411
And we are very hungry.

12:58.308 --> 13:00.629
Okay, we'll eat.

13:03.489 --> 13:06.448
Just don't expect us
to pick up the tab.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.690
Thanks for coming in
on short notice, Mickey.

13:16.691 --> 13:18.813
Sure, buddy. Just
a little confused.

13:18.823 --> 13:20.715
Thought the Hickman
trial was starting.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.738
It is, but we ran
into a problem.

13:22.739 --> 13:24.930
This is you vouchering
for the drug evidence.

13:24.931 --> 13:26.725
- Is that correct?
- Yeah.

13:26.735 --> 13:27.959
I was one of the
original investigators.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.584
What's going on?

13:29.594 --> 13:31.217
Well, half the drugs
are missing now, Mickey.

13:31.218 --> 13:33.440
Somebody pulled a switch.

13:33.450 --> 13:35.243
What, you think it was me,
my brother?

13:35.244 --> 13:36.767
You just put yourself
at the scene.

13:36.768 --> 13:39.398
So the Puerto Rican dude

13:39.399 --> 13:41.261
must have stole the heroin.

13:41.262 --> 13:43.414
Either sold it on the street,
maybe did it himself?

13:43.424 --> 13:45.745
This is your chance
to tell it your way.

13:45.746 --> 13:47.608
No. Look, lady,

13:47.609 --> 13:49.731
you can drug test me right now.

13:49.741 --> 13:52.460
Strap a polygraph on me.
I've got nothing to hide.

13:52.461 --> 13:53.925
You have a better explanation?

13:53.926 --> 13:55.849
Look, I know
I'm just a street guy,

13:55.859 --> 13:57.761
but I followed procedure.

13:57.762 --> 13:59.674
I made the collar,
I vouchered the evidence,

13:59.675 --> 14:01.737
and when somebody
in this office needed it,

14:01.738 --> 14:04.298
I picked it up.
But I am not gonna take the fall

14:04.299 --> 14:05.692
for one of you guys.

14:05.693 --> 14:06.759
What are you suggesting?

14:06.760 --> 14:09.349
I'm not suggesting. I'm telling.

14:09.350 --> 14:11.711
When I signed the drugs out
for a pretrial hearing,

14:11.712 --> 14:14.172
they stayed in the
property safe here,

14:14.173 --> 14:15.666
in this damn office.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.327
So instead of pointing
the finger, you best

14:18.328 --> 14:19.723
get your own house in order.

14:36.681 --> 14:37.747
<i>Eti lyido smeshny.</i>

14:38.744 --> 14:40.706
What'd he say?

14:40.707 --> 14:42.460
He's being critical.

14:42.470 --> 14:43.656
Of what?

14:43.666 --> 14:45.558
Of your country.

14:45.559 --> 14:48.019
He's saying women are
smarter than the men,

14:48.020 --> 14:50.141
and stronger, too.

14:50.142 --> 14:51.607
Can't argue with that.

14:55.134 --> 14:56.658
What'd he say now?

14:56.659 --> 14:59.517
He want to know if you're
sleeping with your partner.

14:59.518 --> 15:00.982
That's funny.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.278
Do you sleep with your partner?

15:06.174 --> 15:07.329
Hey, we don't do that

15:07.330 --> 15:08.725
around here, okay?
We're working.

15:08.735 --> 15:10.527
If you say so.

15:10.528 --> 15:12.421
<i>Zda-ró-vye.</i>

15:12.422 --> 15:14.144
All right, all right,
enough already.

15:14.145 --> 15:16.277
Look, this Rambo guy's
running around,

15:16.278 --> 15:17.941
and you two are sitting here
getting drunk.

15:17.942 --> 15:20.133
We're working as well,
right now.

15:20.134 --> 15:22.195
How about you tell us
what's really going on

15:22.196 --> 15:23.291
with this Rambo guy?

15:23.292 --> 15:25.284
You obviously had
some kind of tip

15:25.285 --> 15:26.579
he was gonna pop his cork.

15:26.580 --> 15:27.577
Okay, lady.

15:28.543 --> 15:30.575
<i>Politsiya politsiy.</i>

15:30.576 --> 15:31.601
"Police is police."

15:31.602 --> 15:33.096
We had information

15:33.097 --> 15:34.530
he was upset.

15:34.531 --> 15:36.285
About what?

15:36.295 --> 15:40.479
He call Moscow and tell 'em
that he was displeased.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.575
Yeah, we know about that
already.

15:41.576 --> 15:42.641
Got called back
for an assignment,

15:42.642 --> 15:43.867
but he didn't want to go

15:43.868 --> 15:44.903
without his girl.

15:44.904 --> 15:46.458
We have information, too, okay?

15:46.468 --> 15:48.589
But we're trying to string
the pieces together here,

15:48.590 --> 15:50.155
fill in the blanks.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.343
Excuse me, pretty lady.

15:55.306 --> 15:56.969
Where's he going?

15:56.970 --> 15:59.061
He's going to bathroom,

15:59.062 --> 16:01.423
even though I tell him
to keep it.

16:01.424 --> 16:03.216
All right, look, there's
a killer running around,

16:03.217 --> 16:05.050
and you guys aren't
telling us anything.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.940
Maybe because we need
to trust you first.

16:10.202 --> 16:13.191
Fine. Down the hatch.

16:18.911 --> 16:22.268
Everybody down! Stay down!

16:23.534 --> 16:25.427
Police! Watch it!

16:26.364 --> 16:27.887
Vronsky!

16:27.888 --> 16:28.983
Hands up. Hands up!

16:28.984 --> 16:30.179
Turn around.

16:30.180 --> 16:31.344
<i>On byl zdes'.</i>

16:31.345 --> 16:32.910
Reagan, Baez!

16:34.335 --> 16:36.028
He was here.

16:36.038 --> 16:36.995
Rambo was here?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.130
Yeah.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.425
And he got away again?

16:39.426 --> 16:40.890
You see anyone?

16:40.891 --> 16:41.947
Where'd he go?

16:41.957 --> 16:43.242
Where'd he go?

16:43.252 --> 16:45.773
He say he don't know,
but he knows.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.846
I didn't start this, Frank.
One of them started it.

16:55.847 --> 16:57.310
The Muslim,
according to the Christian.

16:57.311 --> 16:59.733
Well, you brought it
into our world

16:59.743 --> 17:01.296
when you bailed the guy out.

17:01.297 --> 17:02.293
First things first.

17:02.303 --> 17:03.827
This is the first thing.

17:03.828 --> 17:05.320
Not from where I sit.

17:05.321 --> 17:07.155
Have you looked into

17:07.156 --> 17:08.948
the matter of Officer Macklin?

17:08.949 --> 17:10.094
It's John Macklin now.

17:10.095 --> 17:11.240
He left the department
eight months ago.

17:11.241 --> 17:14.169
Once a Catholic, once a cop,
same thing.

17:14.170 --> 17:16.061
It's complicated.
I'm looking into it.

17:16.063 --> 17:17.328
Well, look faster, please.

17:17.329 --> 17:19.320
The poor man is
barely hanging on.

17:19.321 --> 17:23.237
I would like to help,
if I'm able.

17:23.247 --> 17:25.200
You're able.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.726
Just as you are able
to ask your Christian

17:28.727 --> 17:30.322
to withdraw his complaint.

17:34.746 --> 17:36.309
Please.

17:36.310 --> 17:38.202
That would be wrong.

17:38.203 --> 17:41.161
No, it would be pragmatic,
and it would go a long way

17:41.162 --> 17:43.324
to putting out a fire
that you poured gas on.

17:43.325 --> 17:46.950
What if Mr. Asad won't
withdraw his complaint?

17:46.951 --> 17:49.172
I think he'll consider it.

17:49.173 --> 17:51.534
You think? You mean you know.

17:51.535 --> 17:54.862
I'm confident
if Mr. Khoury will, he will.

17:54.863 --> 17:56.954
I can't. Why not?

17:56.955 --> 17:59.545
He looks at it as
standing up for all his people.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.076
It was a fight over
cutting in line

18:02.077 --> 18:03.201
in a bagel shop, Kevin.

18:03.202 --> 18:04.836
It would be
the wrong way out, Frank.

18:04.837 --> 18:07.157
It would be an abuse
of my influence.

18:07.158 --> 18:09.549
I'd be using the power
of the faith to...

18:09.559 --> 18:10.834
You had a hand in starting this,

18:10.835 --> 18:12.110
you have a responsibility
to finish it.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.743
I have a lot of
responsibilities.

18:13.744 --> 18:14.909
High on that list

18:14.910 --> 18:15.906
is defending the flock.

18:17.072 --> 18:18.865
Your Eminence.

18:18.866 --> 18:21.724
Yes, we're late.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.549
I'll tell you what.

18:25.153 --> 18:28.003
You get Officer Macklin's
health claim put through,

18:28.013 --> 18:29.935
and also see that
he gets promoted

18:29.936 --> 18:32.695
to Detective First Grade
so his family can receive

18:32.696 --> 18:34.787
the pay and benefits
that go along with it,

18:34.788 --> 18:37.079
then we can revisit
this conversation.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.973
You're doubling down.

18:38.983 --> 18:41.434
I'm defending the flock.

18:41.444 --> 18:44.393
May God bless you
and keep you safe.

18:44.961 --> 18:48.150
Thank you, Your Eminence.

18:53.968 --> 18:56.678
Thanks for coming in, Gary.

18:56.679 --> 18:59.388
I'm happy for the excuse
to stop by and see old friends.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.882
So, what's up?

19:00.883 --> 19:02.378
Just following up on an issue

19:02.388 --> 19:04.540
from a case I inherited
when you left the office.

19:04.550 --> 19:05.835
Tommy Hickman?

19:05.845 --> 19:07.668
Right. Of course.

19:07.669 --> 19:09.431
I thought that trial
was just beginning.

19:09.432 --> 19:11.754
It is, but we've
hit a roadblock.

19:11.764 --> 19:13.039
Evidence had been tampered with.

19:14.923 --> 19:15.909
Are you kidding?

19:15.919 --> 19:17.472
Someone substituted sugar

19:17.473 --> 19:20.033
for the drugs that we wanted
to present at the trial.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.827
You think Hickman got to someone

19:21.837 --> 19:23.291
in the property clerk's office?

19:23.292 --> 19:24.387
We're talking to everyone

19:24.388 --> 19:25.484
that would have
handled that evidence.

19:25.494 --> 19:26.848
Of course, I'll get you a list

19:26.849 --> 19:28.344
of every investigator
I worked with.

19:28.354 --> 19:29.978
Well, we've spoken
to all of them.

19:31.811 --> 19:34.731
Hey, Anthony, what's going on?

19:36.425 --> 19:38.885
Gary, we've been
hearing some stories

19:38.886 --> 19:41.247
about why you really
left the office.

19:42.313 --> 19:44.635
You know why
I left the office, Erin.

19:44.645 --> 19:46.298
We talked about it.

19:46.299 --> 19:48.231
It was a tough time
in my marriage.

19:48.232 --> 19:49.626
And there are other rumors

19:49.627 --> 19:51.450
about why your marriage
was in trouble.

19:51.460 --> 19:52.446
Rumors are just rumors.

19:52.456 --> 19:54.976
Gary, we have to ask you,

19:54.977 --> 19:57.467
did you have
a substance abuse problem?

19:57.468 --> 20:00.227
I don't see why
I have to answer that,

20:00.228 --> 20:01.562
I-I don't work here anymore.

20:01.563 --> 20:02.788
Come on, Gary.

20:02.789 --> 20:04.383
You wouldn't take that
from a skel.

20:04.393 --> 20:05.618
Why should we take it from you?

20:05.619 --> 20:07.680
I'm not some skel, Anthony.

20:07.681 --> 20:10.869
I was a prosecutor at this
office for ten years.

20:10.870 --> 20:12.732
And, if I had a problem,

20:12.733 --> 20:14.855
it's over.

20:14.865 --> 20:16.787
I'm remarried,
we just had a baby.

20:16.788 --> 20:18.412
Gary, you know how this looks?

20:18.422 --> 20:20.773
Those drugs were kept in a safe

20:20.774 --> 20:22.437
in your personal office,

20:22.438 --> 20:24.270
while you were
preparing for hearing.

20:24.271 --> 20:25.527
Don't go there, you guys.

20:25.537 --> 20:27.728
Tell me, did you steal
them for your own use?

20:27.729 --> 20:30.587
My God, how can you
even ask me that?

20:30.588 --> 20:32.242
We have to, we started trial.

20:32.252 --> 20:35.500
Do you know what's the first
thing I teach my students?

20:35.510 --> 20:38.260
Never ask a question if
you can't handle the answer.

20:38.270 --> 20:39.565
Yeah, you also taught me,

20:39.566 --> 20:41.259
if you have an
inconvenient fact,

20:41.260 --> 20:43.381
you need to get in front of it.

20:43.382 --> 20:45.275
So you need to come
clean, Gary, right now.

20:45.285 --> 20:46.808
No, you don't.

20:46.809 --> 20:49.131
I'm warning you.

20:49.141 --> 20:51.760
Not just as a former colleague,
but as a friend,

20:51.761 --> 20:55.050
if you start spreading dirt,
it won't just get on me.

20:55.060 --> 20:56.513
What are you talking about?

20:56.514 --> 20:59.174
I successfully prosecuted
30 or 40 drug cases

20:59.175 --> 21:00.708
while at this office.

21:00.709 --> 21:02.631
If you smear me,

21:02.632 --> 21:04.066
all those criminals
could go free.

21:04.067 --> 21:05.721
Is it worth it to you,
just to go after

21:05.731 --> 21:08.121
that piddly little courier?
Come on, Gary,

21:08.122 --> 21:10.214
that's no kind of choice.
Let's end this conversation

21:10.215 --> 21:12.705
right now or I promise you,

21:12.706 --> 21:14.768
we'll all rue the day.

21:25.439 --> 21:28.099
<i>Nyet. Mne ne nuzhny narkotiki.</i>

21:28.100 --> 21:29.534
Well, madam,

21:29.535 --> 21:33.449
he say he don't need
any of your pain drugs.

21:33.450 --> 21:34.417
It's American weakness.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.406
Yeah. Let's talk outside.

21:37.416 --> 21:39.966
Give us a second.

21:39.967 --> 21:41.401
Why the hell didn't you tell us

21:41.402 --> 21:43.463
you had a tip Rambo would be
in the restaurant?

21:43.464 --> 21:45.367
Classified information.

21:45.377 --> 21:47.280
Classified my ass, we could've
had the place surrounded.

21:47.290 --> 21:48.476
Rambo wouldn't
have got away again,

21:48.486 --> 21:50.607
and the witnesses
would be talking to us.

21:50.608 --> 21:52.899
We cannot share
our sources with Americans.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.334
Do you tell us everything
that you know?

21:54.335 --> 21:55.898
If one more person gets killed

21:55.899 --> 21:57.323
because you're not
telling us what you know,

21:57.324 --> 21:58.549
we're gonna have
a serious problem.

21:58.559 --> 21:59.913
And I don't mean a
Russian-America problem,

21:59.914 --> 22:02.544
I mean a me and you
personal problem!

22:02.545 --> 22:04.508
Okay, Reagan, relax.

22:06.999 --> 22:08.293
Sergei, Rambo,

22:08.294 --> 22:10.186
he went to Chechnya.

22:10.187 --> 22:13.285
And he was involved in,
what we call,

22:13.286 --> 22:16.145
"acts of extreme subjugation"

22:16.146 --> 22:18.068
with terrorists
and their families.

22:18.069 --> 22:19.363
He come back not the same.

22:19.364 --> 22:20.301
Meaning he snapped.

22:20.302 --> 22:22.591
When Moscow called him back,

22:22.592 --> 22:24.117
he said he changed sides.

22:24.127 --> 22:26.278
"Changed sides"?
Meaning he became a terrorist?

22:26.279 --> 22:27.842
And now he's running
around my city,

22:27.843 --> 22:29.069
and you don't think
that's something

22:29.079 --> 22:30.782
that you should share with me?

22:30.783 --> 22:32.495
In all probability,
he's just looking for a means

22:32.496 --> 22:33.830
to escape to another country.

22:33.831 --> 22:35.126
In all probability,

22:35.127 --> 22:36.889
he could planning his
next attack right now.

22:36.890 --> 22:38.544
That is true, he's terrorist.

22:38.554 --> 22:40.407
We're gonna start working
together before we end up

22:40.408 --> 22:42.170
facing a wholesale
slaughter, you got it?

22:42.171 --> 22:45.130
Maybe, but it is still
essential to control

22:45.131 --> 22:46.265
the flow of information.

22:46.266 --> 22:47.292
No "maybe."

22:47.293 --> 22:49.882
My city, my country, my way.

22:49.883 --> 22:51.945
We work together.

22:51.946 --> 22:53.939
It's okay.

23:03.155 --> 23:05.745
So, this is the safe where
the drugs were being held

23:05.746 --> 23:06.970
before the hearing?

23:06.971 --> 23:08.305
Yeah, only a handful of people

23:08.306 --> 23:10.328
had the combination,
and Gary was one of them.

23:10.329 --> 23:12.361
And nobody in the office
knew what he was up to?

23:12.362 --> 23:15.250
No, he was being smart about it,
like addicts can be.

23:15.251 --> 23:17.183
He knew the drugs
had already been subjected

23:17.184 --> 23:19.076
to a lab analysis,

23:19.077 --> 23:21.039
so he substituted sugar
every time he used

23:21.040 --> 23:22.763
so the weight and color
looked the same.

23:22.764 --> 23:24.128
And because he thought
we'd never get to trial,

23:24.129 --> 23:25.991
he'd never get found out.

23:25.992 --> 23:27.855
He says he's clean.
I think I believe him.

23:27.856 --> 23:29.120
Well, good for him.

23:29.121 --> 23:30.775
Meanwhile, he's left us

23:30.785 --> 23:33.305
with a big fat problem
with the Hickman case.

23:33.306 --> 23:35.965
Have we tried to do
a quick and dirty plea deal?

23:35.966 --> 23:37.360
It'd be sticky.

23:37.361 --> 23:38.954
Sticky's what we do here.

23:38.955 --> 23:42.213
Hickman's lawyer already senses
we have a major problem.

23:42.214 --> 23:43.907
The only deal
he's gonna consider

23:43.917 --> 23:45.909
is no jail time for his client.

23:45.910 --> 23:47.135
Erin, I don't like
cutting Hickman

23:47.136 --> 23:49.167
that big of a break either,

23:49.168 --> 23:51.061
but we need to handle
this as quickly

23:51.062 --> 23:52.256
and as quietly as possible.

23:52.257 --> 23:54.119
I know, but it's too late.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.813
The case is too high profile,

23:55.814 --> 23:58.304
and even if we make a deal,
there's no guarantee

23:58.305 --> 24:00.566
that Hickman's gonna
keep his mouth shut.

24:00.567 --> 24:03.127
If it comes out that Gary
tampered with evidence,

24:03.128 --> 24:06.056
every case he was involved in
will be reopened.

24:06.057 --> 24:08.508
Gary's going to prison.

24:08.518 --> 24:10.969
And he's a friend,
and a mentor to both of us.

24:10.979 --> 24:12.832
I...

24:12.833 --> 24:14.067
I have to say, Monica,
I don't...

24:14.068 --> 24:16.857
I know.

24:16.858 --> 24:19.050
There are no good options.

24:26.164 --> 24:27.897
I'm sorry,
I still don't understand.

24:27.898 --> 24:30.119
My English is not so good.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.952
Funny, considering you went
to high school in Coney Island.

24:31.953 --> 24:33.976
Why don't you cut
the crap, all right?

24:33.986 --> 24:35.579
We know you helped
Rambo get away

24:35.580 --> 24:37.223
from the crime scene.

24:37.224 --> 24:39.257
So lose the accent and tell us
where the hell he is.

24:41.957 --> 24:43.452
If you know about his nickname,

24:43.462 --> 24:44.936
why do you think
I'd help you get him?

24:48.513 --> 24:49.937
What?

24:49.938 --> 24:51.033
I have idea.

24:51.034 --> 24:53.793
Great.

24:53.794 --> 24:55.427
I'm thinking I should
speak to him alone.

24:55.428 --> 24:56.952
Do you have room
with a window, no bars?

24:56.953 --> 24:59.841
So you can hang him
out the window by his ankles,

24:59.842 --> 25:01.475
is that what
you're talking about?

25:01.476 --> 25:03.599
There would be more honesty
in conversation.

25:03.609 --> 25:06.397
No, we don't do things
like that around here.

25:06.398 --> 25:08.420
My clearance rate
is almost 100%.

25:08.421 --> 25:09.855
What is yours?

25:09.856 --> 25:11.111
Look, we make cases
the right way

25:11.121 --> 25:12.874
so they stand up,
you understand?

25:12.875 --> 25:14.408
Okay.

25:14.409 --> 25:16.531
How do you say, um...

25:16.532 --> 25:17.867
it is your funeral.

25:19.182 --> 25:20.487
Thought we were gonna
work together here.

25:20.497 --> 25:22.789
American, you thought it
would happen right away?

25:26.775 --> 25:29.105
Okay. Where were we?

25:29.106 --> 25:31.557
Will you please tell the
detective what you just told me?

25:31.567 --> 25:32.622
Tell me what?

25:32.623 --> 25:34.585
Promise you won't say I talked.

25:34.586 --> 25:35.751
To who? Right?

25:35.752 --> 25:36.948
Fine.

25:37.984 --> 25:39.836
Rambo said he just needed
to go some place

25:39.837 --> 25:41.670
where he could chill
and clear his system

25:41.671 --> 25:43.533
without being tracked.

25:43.534 --> 25:45.396
What does he mean
clear his system?

25:45.397 --> 25:47.718
He's really not a guy you
want to ask a lot of questions.

25:47.719 --> 25:49.811
Clear his system?

25:55.799 --> 25:57.025
Clear his system, you hear...?

25:57.035 --> 25:58.788
Hey!

26:02.385 --> 26:03.541
Hey, you see

26:03.551 --> 26:05.106
where the dumb looking
Russian guy went?

26:17.511 --> 26:19.423
<i>How did you know</i>

26:19.424 --> 26:21.327
he was headed back to the
same restaurant? I didn't.

26:21.337 --> 26:23.758
It's a GPS
I put on his car before.

26:25.751 --> 26:26.946
Like the other Reagan said,

26:26.956 --> 26:28.710
trust, but verify.

26:34.728 --> 26:36.621
What do you think he's doing here?
Don't know.

26:36.631 --> 26:38.155
He must think we miss him.

26:38.156 --> 26:39.451
Let's find out.

26:55.214 --> 26:56.538
Please.

26:56.539 --> 26:59.597
Your presence is unhelpful
and unnecessary.

26:59.598 --> 27:01.222
Duly noted.

27:01.232 --> 27:02.935
Where's Rambo?

27:02.936 --> 27:04.649
I'm trying to find out, but
now you're getting in the way.

27:04.650 --> 27:06.193
We're getting in the way?

27:06.194 --> 27:07.739
How about we lock you two up
for obstructing?

27:07.749 --> 27:10.567
We'll put you in a nice small
room with bars on the windows.

27:10.568 --> 27:12.530
Okay, okay,
we'll do it together.

27:12.531 --> 27:13.726
Police is police.

27:13.727 --> 27:15.590
Right? Wrong.

27:16.487 --> 27:18.619
<i>Pokazhi mne.</i>

27:34.312 --> 27:35.568
What, he's in the freezer?

27:38.427 --> 27:39.562
What'd she say?

27:39.563 --> 27:41.725
It's passageway.
She wants you to go first.

27:45.183 --> 27:47.235
Step aside.

27:52.456 --> 27:53.523
Go.

28:17.197 --> 28:19.159
5-4, detectives requesting
a 10-85 forthwith at...

28:19.160 --> 28:20.384
where the hell are we anyway?

28:20.385 --> 28:21.501
Behind the restaurant, lady.

28:23.185 --> 28:26.334
Russian bathhouse adjacent
to our previous location.

28:26.344 --> 28:28.186
Why would Rambo come here?

28:28.187 --> 28:30.029
Clear his system,
steal clothes, I.D.,

28:30.030 --> 28:31.325
get a massage.

28:31.326 --> 28:33.287
Hey, kid, hey.

28:33.288 --> 28:36.009
You seen him?

28:42.126 --> 28:43.361
For sure, he is here.

28:43.362 --> 28:45.085
Reagan, once he knows
he's in a corner,

28:45.086 --> 28:46.381
he gonna be much more dangerous.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.416
Should wait
for emergency service.

28:47.417 --> 28:48.543
We don't have time.

28:53.007 --> 28:55.358
Son of a bitch.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.214
We got two in here.

29:00.878 --> 29:02.512
10-13, two dead at the scene.

29:02.513 --> 29:04.167
An active shooter
in the building.

29:04.176 --> 29:05.532
Where'd he go?

29:07.066 --> 29:08.360
What'd she say, Levin?

29:08.361 --> 29:09.387
Levin!

29:09.388 --> 29:10.822
Where the hell did he go?

29:17.139 --> 29:18.504
Move, get out of the way!

29:18.505 --> 29:19.929
Police!

29:21.195 --> 29:23.018
- Police, move!
- Back there.

29:23.028 --> 29:24.015
Back there. Get out of the way.

29:24.025 --> 29:25.280
Move, move!

29:26.187 --> 29:28.279
Move it!

29:30.900 --> 29:32.165
Which way, which way?!

29:33.201 --> 29:35.094
There, there!

29:41.671 --> 29:42.866
Turn it off.

29:49.183 --> 29:50.977
Hey.

29:50.987 --> 29:52.809
Are you okay?

29:52.810 --> 29:54.375
Yeah, I'm hit. He's in here.

30:05.614 --> 30:06.969
Sergei Karenin!

30:07.935 --> 30:09.101
Police!

30:13.326 --> 30:15.288
Sergei?

30:15.289 --> 30:17.142
Reagan, what are you
waiting for?

30:17.152 --> 30:18.705
Shut up!

30:18.706 --> 30:20.769
Don't be a girl! Shut up!

30:30.982 --> 30:32.008
Reagan?

30:33.871 --> 30:35.266
I got him.

30:44.573 --> 30:46.237
KGB, my ass.

30:59.319 --> 31:01.272
Everything you wanted.

31:02.239 --> 31:03.584
That hardly ever happens.

31:03.763 --> 31:06.503
Including his promotion to
detective with all its benefits.

31:07.619 --> 31:08.376
What about the benefits

31:08.546 --> 31:10.209
from the World Trade Center's
Health Program

31:10.210 --> 31:11.374
or the Victim's Comp Fund?

31:11.375 --> 31:12.839
I don't control those.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.803
But your word has weight.

31:15.630 --> 31:19.317
You know, he had some
good years on the job,

31:19.616 --> 31:21.009
and some less good ones.

31:21.010 --> 31:22.345
What's that a code for?

31:22.346 --> 31:25.035
Smoked and drank for decades
before he got sick.

31:25.036 --> 31:26.032
But he also worked

31:26.033 --> 31:27.625
on the pile before he got sick.

31:27.626 --> 31:29.289
It would be pushing it

31:29.290 --> 31:32.279
to attribute his illness
strictly to working on the pile.

31:32.280 --> 31:33.614
So you're denying him?

31:33.615 --> 31:35.608
No, I am pushing it through.

31:35.747 --> 31:38.506
But I thought you should know...

31:38.507 --> 31:40.967
it's a favor.

31:40.968 --> 31:43.658
Well, then, thank you, Frank.

31:44.625 --> 31:46.887
Or it will be when I sign them.

31:47.315 --> 31:50.304
Which, I take it,
you have not yet done.

31:50.474 --> 31:52.206
You know, I thought
we should go out together

31:52.207 --> 31:53.801
and visit Macklin
and his family,

31:53.802 --> 31:55.794
make a private little
ceremony of it.

31:56.751 --> 31:58.186
That's a nice idea.

31:58.485 --> 31:59.939
Right after you
pick up that phone

32:00.119 --> 32:02.340
and call your legal eagle,
Mr. Sloane,

32:02.341 --> 32:05.230
and tell him to post bail
for the other guy.

32:07.263 --> 32:09.055
I'm the archbishop
of New York, Frank,

32:09.056 --> 32:10.282
I'm not a bail bondsman.

32:10.292 --> 32:11.417
You put your thumb on the scale,

32:11.418 --> 32:13.011
now it's time to take it off.

32:13.012 --> 32:14.077
You forcing my hand?

32:14.078 --> 32:16.200
I've been ducking calls

32:16.210 --> 32:18.332
from Immigration and Customs
and the State Department.

32:18.333 --> 32:22.219
I don't like ducking calls,
makes me feel all sweaty.

32:23.384 --> 32:26.442
You'd really withhold benefits
from this officer's family?

32:26.443 --> 32:29.103
Hey, it was a coin toss
whether he qualifies,

32:29.104 --> 32:33.158
so, I flipped the coin
till it came up heads.

32:33.159 --> 32:36.447
Like I said, as a favor to you.

32:36.457 --> 32:39.445
But your part is private, quiet.

32:39.446 --> 32:41.338
What you're offering in return
would be public

32:41.339 --> 32:42.703
and controversial.

32:42.704 --> 32:45.265
You chose the playing field,
not me.

32:46.989 --> 32:50.684
I don't like this, Frank.

32:50.685 --> 32:53.306
More to the point,
I don't like you in this.

32:54.272 --> 32:55.836
Me, either.

32:55.837 --> 32:57.659
I'm just gonna have
to live with that.

32:57.660 --> 32:58.696
Not much choice.

33:02.184 --> 33:05.173
I don't have all day,
Your Eminence.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.693
Do we have a deal?

33:20.109 --> 33:22.659
Can you find me
Mr. Sloane, please?

33:34.666 --> 33:36.190
<i>Were you aware that quantities</i>

33:36.200 --> 33:39.548
of heroin were removed
and replaced with sugar?

33:39.558 --> 33:43.941
Well, I became aware when
you brought it to my attention,

33:43.942 --> 33:46.851
recently.

33:46.852 --> 33:49.760
Did you take some of the drugs
and replace it with sugar?

33:49.761 --> 33:51.823
On the advice of counsel,
I'm going to invoke

33:51.824 --> 33:55.111
my Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination.

33:55.112 --> 33:57.124
Isn't it true that
during this time,

33:57.125 --> 33:59.136
you were addicted to painkillers
because of a back injury?

33:59.137 --> 34:01.099
On the advice of counsel...

34:01.100 --> 34:02.654
Did you transition

34:02.664 --> 34:04.985
from using painkillers
to using heroin?

34:04.986 --> 34:07.147
Again, on the
advice of counsel...

34:07.148 --> 34:09.510
Counsel, approach.

34:19.882 --> 34:21.475
Ms. Reagan,

34:21.476 --> 34:23.100
we can spare everyone
a lot of agony here

34:23.110 --> 34:25.002
by granting this
witness immunity

34:25.003 --> 34:26.896
to get his full testimony
in this hearing.

34:26.897 --> 34:29.686
In what world is that
fair to my client?

34:29.687 --> 34:32.377
A prosecutor who is
stealing drugs gets immunity

34:32.387 --> 34:34.777
while the regular citizen
gets prison.

34:35.745 --> 34:37.100
Ms. Reagan?

34:38.036 --> 34:41.393
No immunity.
I'd like to continue.

34:41.393 --> 34:42.620
Then have at it.

34:50.501 --> 34:51.596
Mr. Falk,

34:51.597 --> 34:53.757
you were an officer of the court

34:53.759 --> 34:57.016
who swore to uphold the law,
didn't you?

34:57.016 --> 34:59.309
I did.

35:00.076 --> 35:01.968
Did you betray that oath?

35:01.969 --> 35:03.652
On the advice of counsel,

35:03.653 --> 35:05.326
I invoke my...
Did you betray your friends?

35:05.327 --> 35:06.791
No! Your colleagues?

35:06.792 --> 35:08.286
No! Did you betray
that oath you took?

35:08.287 --> 35:09.911
That wasn't my intention.

35:09.921 --> 35:12.511
But that's what happened,
isn't it?

35:17.663 --> 35:20.192
Mr. Falk?

35:20.193 --> 35:22.714
Do you wish to invoke
your Fifth Amendment again?

35:30.496 --> 35:33.654
No, Your Honor.

35:33.655 --> 35:35.717
I'm prepared to answer
Ms. Reagan's question.

35:37.541 --> 35:42.493
Did you betray your duty
to uphold the law?

35:44.396 --> 35:45.551
Yes.

35:48.879 --> 35:50.942
And for that...

35:53.572 --> 35:55.495
I am profoundly sorry.

35:57.458 --> 36:00.417
More than you or anyone else

36:00.418 --> 36:02.839
can possibly know.

36:02.849 --> 36:05.139
And finally, Mr. Falk,

36:05.140 --> 36:07.800
did you ever tamper
with evidence

36:07.801 --> 36:11.218
in order to convict someone
that was innocent?

36:11.228 --> 36:14.676
No, Ms. Reagan.

36:14.686 --> 36:16.638
I never planted evidence.

36:16.639 --> 36:18.202
Every case I brought
was legitimate,

36:18.203 --> 36:20.834
including the one
against Mr. Hickman.

36:22.727 --> 36:24.191
If...

36:25.118 --> 36:27.310
if I have to go to prison...

36:29.273 --> 36:31.336
like the people
I've prosecuted...

36:33.827 --> 36:35.261
so be it.

36:37.423 --> 36:40.811
At least my conscious
is clear now.

36:54.741 --> 36:57.330
You know, the doctors
wanted both of you guys

36:57.331 --> 36:59.523
to stay here for
continued observation.

36:59.533 --> 37:01.256
This is not necessary.

37:01.257 --> 37:03.219
Moscow doctors,
best in the world.

37:03.220 --> 37:05.710
If you'd both been
a little more upfront,

37:05.711 --> 37:08.003
neither of you would be
going home with gunshot wounds.

37:08.013 --> 37:10.303
Please. These
are marks of honor.

37:10.304 --> 37:12.226
Souvenirs from New York.

37:12.227 --> 37:13.661
And to think, we were gonna stop

37:13.662 --> 37:15.285
and get you NYPD coffee mugs.

37:15.286 --> 37:17.647
I've already
took one from your desk.

37:17.648 --> 37:20.079
Ha! Just kidding.

37:21.544 --> 37:24.592
If you ever come to Moscow,
please let me know.

37:24.602 --> 37:26.595
I will love to
take you to Bolshoi.

37:39.588 --> 37:41.979
So, what is this?

37:41.989 --> 37:43.642
Potatoes au gratin.

37:43.643 --> 37:46.303
Or French for
"cheesy deliciousness."

37:46.304 --> 37:47.638
And that's French for

37:47.639 --> 37:49.601
"straight to your butt."

37:49.602 --> 37:50.957
Exactly.

37:50.967 --> 37:52.919
Made with Dubliner
Irish cheddar,

37:52.920 --> 37:55.948
with an eye to the old sod.

37:55.949 --> 37:57.413
It's the 101st anniversary

37:57.414 --> 37:58.937
of the Rising.

37:58.938 --> 37:59.875
The what?

37:59.876 --> 38:01.298
The Easter Rising?

38:01.299 --> 38:03.062
They don't teach that
in school anymore, Jack.

38:03.063 --> 38:05.254
They don't even give
out books in school anymore.

38:05.255 --> 38:07.247
It was the Irish, our ancestors,

38:07.248 --> 38:09.180
fighting for
their independence in 1916.

38:09.181 --> 38:11.272
And some of the family
who didn't make it over here

38:11.273 --> 38:12.300
got caught up in that.

38:12.310 --> 38:13.704
We had family who
fought over there?

38:14.472 --> 38:15.428
As soldiers?

38:15.429 --> 38:17.191
They weren't exactly soldiers.

38:17.192 --> 38:19.353
They were fighting to get their
country back from the British,

38:19.354 --> 38:20.917
and they called themselves
"rebels."

38:20.918 --> 38:22.473
And you know what the British
called those rebels?

38:22.483 --> 38:23.379
Micks?

38:23.380 --> 38:24.474
Excuse me?

38:24.475 --> 38:25.472
Terrorists.

38:25.473 --> 38:26.497
Seriously?

38:26.498 --> 38:27.762
Bet you didn't think that term

38:27.763 --> 38:29.058
existed 100 years ago.

38:29.059 --> 38:30.394
Actually, I didn't think it did.

38:31.321 --> 38:32.954
So why were they
called terrorists?

38:32.955 --> 38:35.275
Because, by definition,
they were.

38:35.276 --> 38:36.341
Well, why not call them
"guerillas"?

38:36.342 --> 38:38.254
Isn't it the same thing?

38:38.255 --> 38:40.177
Well, guerilla's actually
Spanish for "little war."

38:40.178 --> 38:42.091
Their tactics are alike, but
the big difference is that

38:42.092 --> 38:44.123
a terrorist will target
civilians for political ends.

38:44.124 --> 38:46.813
So, we are descended
from terrorists.

38:46.814 --> 38:48.439
Whoa...

38:48.449 --> 38:50.141
Come on, that's a very
college way of putting it.

38:50.142 --> 38:51.367
Not terrorists

38:51.368 --> 38:53.131
the way they use the term now.

38:53.132 --> 38:54.197
- I know.
- Right.

38:54.198 --> 38:55.194
We have relatives

38:55.195 --> 38:56.359
who were freedom fighters, okay?

38:56.360 --> 38:57.983
Let's just leave it at that.

38:57.984 --> 39:00.145
Amen. Here, here.

39:00.146 --> 39:01.372
Hardly anybody who's here

39:01.382 --> 39:02.368
is really from here.

39:02.378 --> 39:03.335
I guess you could say

39:03.336 --> 39:05.296
we're all foreigners.

39:05.297 --> 39:07.229
Yeah, and usually they're
fleeing some kind of grief

39:07.230 --> 39:08.854
in their own country.

39:08.855 --> 39:11.036
- Some things never change.
- We're not perfect,

39:11.037 --> 39:13.208
but no one's come up with a
version 2.0 that's better, so...

39:13.209 --> 39:15.370
So who gets to say that they're
really, truly from here?

39:15.371 --> 39:17.632
Munsees, Algonquins, Iroquois,

39:17.633 --> 39:19.096
and a whole bunch
of other tribes

39:19.097 --> 39:21.189
whose names I've forgotten,
they can.

39:21.190 --> 39:23.082
Everyone else...

39:23.083 --> 39:24.946
is an immigrant.

39:26.809 --> 39:28.234
Here's to all us great unwashed.

39:28.244 --> 39:29.369
- Here, here.
- Drink to that.

39:29.370 --> 39:30.367
Bottoms up.

39:30.367 --> 39:31.293
Here, here.

39:31.303 --> 39:32.448
Cheers.

39:32.449 --> 39:33.804
Here, here.
