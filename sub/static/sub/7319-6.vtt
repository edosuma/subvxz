WEBVTT

00:11.933 --> 00:13.800
PREVIOUSLY ON
"GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:13.833 --> 00:15.100
WHEN I TOLD YOU I WAS DONE
TRYING TO COMPETE?

00:15.133 --> 00:16.700
THAT WAS ME BREAKING UP
WITH YOU.

00:16.733 --> 00:19.600
I BROKE UP WITH FINN.
YEAH.

00:19.633 --> 00:21.533
THE PATIENT DIED LAST MONTH
FROM COMPLICATIONS

00:21.567 --> 00:23.367
FOLLOWING A HEART TRANSPLANT.
DENNY.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.133
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS
FOR ME?
I GOT SHOT.
I'M NOT FINE.

00:26.167 --> 00:30.033
YOU'RE NOT FINE.
YOU QUIT BEING A SURGEON.

00:30.067 --> 00:32.167
YOU'LL STAND ON MY RIGHT SIDE,
I'LL LOOK AT YOU,

00:32.200 --> 00:34.433
AND YOU'LL KNOW TO SLIDE IN TO
DO THE SUTURES WE'VE PRACTICED.

00:34.467 --> 00:35.600
NOBODY HAS TO KNOW.

00:35.633 --> 00:36.767
***

00:36.800 --> 00:38.433
(Meredith) TO MAKE IT...

00:38.467 --> 00:40.367
REALLY MAKE IT...

00:40.400 --> 00:42.167
AS A SURGEON...

00:42.200 --> 00:44.367
IT TAKES MAJOR COMMITMENT.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.300
***

00:51.800 --> 00:54.133
WE HAVE TO BE WILLING
TO PICK UP THAT SCALPEL

00:54.167 --> 00:57.700
AND MAKE A CUT
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT

00:57.733 --> 00:59.800
DO MORE DAMAGE THAN GOOD.

00:59.833 --> 01:01.733
IT'S ALL ABOUT
BEING COMMITTED...

01:01.767 --> 01:05.367
BECAUSE IF WE'RE NOT...

01:05.400 --> 01:07.300
WE HAVE NO BUSINESS
PICKING UP THAT SCALPEL

01:07.333 --> 01:09.100
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:09.133 --> 01:11.067
***

01:11.067 --> 01:13.233
PUT BURKE IN O.R. 2
TOMORROW AT 10:00 A.M.,

01:13.267 --> 01:14.733
THE USUAL SCRUB TEAM.

01:14.767 --> 01:17.100
AND GET RID OF HIS
VALVE REPLACEMENT AT 2:00.

01:17.133 --> 01:18.600
THAT'S NO--
THAT'S NO GOOD.

01:18.633 --> 01:20.533
YANG, BROUGHT YOU
A LATTE.

01:20.567 --> 01:22.133
YOU'RE NOT SCRUBBING IN.

01:22.167 --> 01:24.067
BUT BURKE ALWAYS
LET'S ME SCRUB IN.

01:24.100 --> 01:25.833
HEY, YANG, UH, CAN I
GET IN ON BURKE'S--

01:25.867 --> 01:27.400
NO, NO, OKAY?
NO RESIDENTS.

01:27.433 --> 01:29.467
BURKE SAYS YOU CROWD HIM,
SO JUST GO AWAY.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.300
MAKE SURE YOU PUT
THE INSTRUMENT TRAY

01:31.333 --> 01:32.833
ON HIS LEFT-HAND SIDE.

01:32.867 --> 01:34.767
HE NEEDS
THE EXTRA ELBOW ROOM.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.100
AND REMEMBER, O.R. TWO.
NO GALLERY. BURKE WAS SPECIFIC.

01:37.133 --> 01:40.067
DR. BURKE'S BECOME VERY SPECIFIC
SINCE COMING BACK TO WORK,

01:40.067 --> 01:41.533
HASN'T HE?

01:41.567 --> 01:44.533
DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL HIM
YOU SAID THAT?

01:44.567 --> 01:46.733
BURKE'S BACK, AND SUDDENLY
CRISTINA'S RUNNING HIS BOARD?

01:46.767 --> 01:48.667
WHO DOES SHE THINK
SHE IS--BAILEY?

01:48.700 --> 01:51.333
SHE'S HELPING HIM.
BULL.
SHE'S TAKING ADVANTAGE.

01:51.367 --> 01:52.567
SHE GETS OUT OF ROUNDS,

01:52.600 --> 01:55.200
SHE SCRUBS IN ON EVERY SURGERY
BURKE DOES,

01:55.233 --> 01:56.800
SHE'S ORDERING AROUND
THIRD-YEAR RESIDENTS.
YOU GUYS ARE OVERREACTING.

01:56.833 --> 01:59.133
(Cristina) I'M SO SORRY.
IT'S COMPLETELY ILLEGIBLE.

01:59.167 --> 02:01.667
I MEAN, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST WRITE IT PROPERLY?

02:01.700 --> 02:03.267
SHE IS WRITING
ON THE O.R. BOARD.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.800
MAYBE I SHOULD SLEEP
WITH BURKE.

02:05.833 --> 02:08.067
(Meredith) YOU'VE BEEN BUSY.

02:09.200 --> 02:10.567
YEAH.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.567
DEREK HASN'T CALLED YET.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.200
I TOLD HIM I BROKE UP
WITH FINN A WEEK AGO.

02:15.233 --> 02:17.167
HE STILL HASN'T CALLED.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.533
HEY, DO YOU WANT TO GO
GRAB A DRINK, CATCH UP?
UH, NO, I CAN'T.

02:19.567 --> 02:22.433
I HAVE TO STUDY UP FOR
BURKE'S SURGERIES TOMORROW.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.133
SHE'S BUSY.

02:30.833 --> 02:32.600
CALLIE.

02:34.067 --> 02:37.067
HEY, TALK TO ME.

02:37.067 --> 02:39.767
HEY, HOW ABOUT TALKING TO ME
INSTEAD OF IGNORING ME?

02:39.800 --> 02:40.733
CALLIE.

02:40.767 --> 02:42.567
GEORGE!

02:42.600 --> 02:45.467
WELL, THAT'S TALKING.
THAT'S A GOOD START.

02:49.233 --> 02:50.167
OH!

02:50.200 --> 02:51.667
OH, GOD.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.667
HEY, STRANGER.

02:53.700 --> 02:56.767
OH, NANCY.
YOU DON'T CALL FIRST?
(knock on door)

02:56.800 --> 02:58.433
HI.
UH...

02:58.467 --> 02:59.733
I KNOW I...

02:59.767 --> 03:01.600

03:03.767 --> 03:05.367
OH, MEREDITH.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.267
MEREDITH, WAIT.
LET ME EXPLAIN. MEREDITH.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.500
(engine turns over)
OOPS.

03:10.533 --> 03:12.367
I TAKE IT THAT WAS
THE SLUTTY INTERN

03:12.400 --> 03:15.200
YOU CHEATED ON ADDISON WITH?
SHE'S NOT SLUTTY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:15.233 --> 03:17.133
YOU BAILED ON THANKSGIVING
AND CHRISTMAS,

03:17.167 --> 03:19.467
AND YOU LIVE IN A TRAILER,
AND YOU'RE GETTING A DIVORCE.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.733
AND THEN THERE'S
THE SLUTTY INTERN.
I REALLY DON'T LIKE YOU.

03:21.767 --> 03:24.767
YOU LOVE ME.

03:29.633 --> 03:31.267
FEELING GOOD. REALLY GOOD.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.233
GOOD.

03:32.267 --> 03:33.200
GOOD.

03:33.233 --> 03:35.133
YEAH, FIRST DAY BACK.

03:35.167 --> 03:37.067
IT'S BIG. (chuckles)
KINDA NERVOUS.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.733
BUT FEELING GOOD.
DO I LOOK OKAY?

03:38.767 --> 03:40.133
GREAT.
GREAT.

03:40.167 --> 03:42.167
I WANT TO GET OFF
ON THE RIGHT FOOT.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.100
GOTTA GET MY I.D. RENEWED,
NEW TIME CARD,

03:44.133 --> 03:46.067

AND THEN I'M BACK.

03:46.067 --> 03:47.467
I'M REALLY BACK.
YEAH.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.400
YEAH.

03:49.433 --> 03:52.300
THIS IS ME--HUMAN RESOURCES.
SEE YOU GUYS ON THE FLOOR.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.233
YEAH.

03:54.267 --> 03:57.267

04:02.300 --> 04:04.700
OKAY, I'LL BE CRISTINA

04:04.733 --> 04:06.733
IF YOU'LL BE IZZIE FOR ME.

04:06.767 --> 04:07.833
DEAL.

04:07.867 --> 04:10.633
(elevator stops)

04:10.667 --> 04:12.800
DEREK HAD A WOMAN
IN HIS TRAILER LAST NIGHT.

04:12.833 --> 04:14.633
SHE WAS UGLY, VERY UGLY.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.567
EXCEPT SHE WAS TALL
AND BEAUTIFUL.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.067
AND HE WAS NAKED.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.567
OH, UH...

04:21.600 --> 04:25.100
McDREAMY WAS DOING
THE McNASTY WITH A McHOTTIE?

04:25.133 --> 04:27.133
THAT McBASTARD.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.800
HOW--HOW WAS THAT?

04:28.833 --> 04:30.733
THAT WAS GOOD.
CRISTINA ENOUGH? REALLY?

04:30.767 --> 04:32.667
YEAH.
YEAH?

04:32.700 --> 04:33.700
YEAH.
YEAH, 'CAUSE--

04:33.733 --> 04:34.800
CHANNELING IZZIE. GO.

04:34.833 --> 04:37.700
OKAY, UH, CALLIE...
SHE WON'T FORGIVE ME.

04:37.733 --> 04:40.700
UM... SHE WON'T TALK TO ME.
SHE DUMPED ME.

04:40.733 --> 04:42.667
WHICH IS, UH...

04:42.700 --> 04:46.167
I DON'T CARE ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, AT ALL.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.400
GOOD,
BECAUSE YOU DESERVE BETTER.

04:48.433 --> 04:50.100
YOU DO.

04:50.133 --> 04:52.233
YOU ARE GEORGE.

04:52.267 --> 04:54.233
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY.

04:54.267 --> 04:55.767
SERIOUSLY.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.500
WAS THAT IZZIE-OPTIMISTIC?

04:59.533 --> 05:02.467
THAT'S VERY IZZIE.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.300
(sighs)

05:03.333 --> 05:05.367
WHAT THE HELL
HAS HAPPENED TO US?

05:05.400 --> 05:06.567
WE ARE NOW THE PEOPLE

05:06.600 --> 05:09.167
THAT THE PEOPLE WE WANT
TO BE WITH AVOID.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.300
WE HAVE CAREERS
TO THINK ABOUT.

05:10.333 --> 05:13.200
WE DON'T NEED ATTENTION
FROM MEN WITH PERFECT HAIR.

05:13.233 --> 05:16.067
YOU KNOW,
WE SHOULD MAKE A PACT.

05:16.100 --> 05:18.233
THERE'S NO MORE DATING.
NO MORE DEREK.
NO MORE CALLIE.

05:18.267 --> 05:20.633
JUST 100% FOCUS ON OUR WORK.
THEY'RE DEAD TO US.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.667
THEY ARE FREAKIN' CORPSES
TO US.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.367
PRESTON BURKE.
WHAT A PLEASURE.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.333
I HAVE READ SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.400
WELL, THANK YOU.

05:27.433 --> 05:29.433
PRUITT BYRD. MEDIVAC
BROUGHT HIM IN THIS MORNING.

05:29.467 --> 05:31.600
HE PRESENTS WITH
A PRIMARY CARDIAC TUMOR.

05:31.633 --> 05:34.200
WE'VE BEEN TOLD
PRUITT NEEDS

05:34.233 --> 05:36.133
A "CARDIAC
AUTOTRANSPLANTATION."

05:36.167 --> 05:38.067
A CARDIAC
AUTOTRANSPLANTATION?

05:38.100 --> 05:40.800
A HUMPTY DUMPTY SURGERY.
YES, I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

05:40.833 --> 05:43.500
MRS. BYRD, THIS IS
A VERY COMPLICATED SURGERY.

05:43.533 --> 05:45.700
YOU'LL NEED THOROUGH TESTING.
(Cristina)
OH, ALREADY DONE.

05:45.733 --> 05:48.767
MR. BYRD
IS A PERFECT CANDIDATE.
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT THIS SURGERY ENTAILS?

05:48.800 --> 05:50.567
WE HAVE TO--
WE HAVE TO REMOVE HIS HEART,

05:50.600 --> 05:52.367
CUT IT OPEN,
SCRAPE OUT ALL THE TUMOR

05:52.400 --> 05:54.333
AND THEN PUT HIS HEART
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

05:54.367 --> 05:55.533
WHICH IS RISKY.

05:55.567 --> 05:57.300
BUT POSSIBLE.

05:57.333 --> 05:58.500
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE.

05:58.533 --> 06:01.333
I WANT THE VERY BEST
FOR MY PRUITT.

06:01.367 --> 06:03.367
THE BEST.
SHE MEANS YOU.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.767
I KNOW THAT, HOWEVER--

06:04.800 --> 06:08.567
I'VE SCHEDULED MR. BYRD
FOR SURGERY THIS AFTERNOON.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.067
JUST TRYING TO BE
AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.533
LEGAL CLEARED STEVENS.

06:12.567 --> 06:15.167
EXPLAIN HER PARAMETERS
AND MAKE SURE SHE UNDERSTANDS.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.167
WHAT, STEVENS IS
BEING ASSIGNED TO ME AGAIN?

06:17.200 --> 06:19.167
SHE'S YOUR INTERN.
BUT I-I DIDN'T THINK THAT--

06:19.200 --> 06:22.067
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER FOR HER
TO START FRESH

06:22.100 --> 06:24.067
WITH ANOTHER RESIDENT?

06:24.067 --> 06:25.133
YOU DON'T WANT HER, HUH?

06:25.167 --> 06:28.467
I... WANT HER TO SUCCEED.

06:31.167 --> 06:33.067
THERE'S STILL A GOOD DEAL
OF FALLOUT

06:33.100 --> 06:35.500
AFTER THE DUQUETTE M&M.

06:35.533 --> 06:36.667
THERE'S BEEN TALK.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.600
LOOK, I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU

06:38.633 --> 06:40.733
THAT THERE ARE
DOCTORS IN THIS HOSPITAL

06:40.767 --> 06:44.067
WHO HAVE CONCERNS
ABOUT YOUR JUDGMENT.
CONCERNS ABOUT MY JUDGMENT?

06:44.067 --> 06:45.233
STEVENS WAS YOUR MISTAKE.

06:45.267 --> 06:46.767
DO YOU, SIR?

06:46.800 --> 06:49.133
DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS
ABOUT MY JUDGMENT?

06:49.167 --> 06:51.367
(sighs) DO YOU?

06:54.833 --> 06:57.167
YOU'RE NOT GONNA PUT
THOSE CONCERNS TO REST

06:57.200 --> 06:58.567
BY AVOIDING
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY

06:58.600 --> 07:00.367
FOR DR. STEVENS.

07:00.400 --> 07:04.233
SHE'S YOUR INTERN... AGAIN.

07:04.267 --> 07:05.467
TRANSFER FROM MERCY WEST.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.267
NOELLE LABATT,
32 WEEKS ALONG,

07:07.300 --> 07:08.833
PREGNANT WITH TWINS.

07:08.867 --> 07:11.333
ONE APPEARS TO BE DEVELOPING
MORE SLOWLY THAN THE OTHER.

07:11.367 --> 07:12.833
(man) HI. HELLO.
HI, THERE.

07:12.867 --> 07:13.967
GREG STANTON.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.167
THIS IS MY FIANCéE, THE FUTURE
MRS. STANTON--UH, NOELLE.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.100
GREG, I PROMISE YOU,
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON

07:18.133 --> 07:19.667
WHO CARES IF WE'RE MARRIED
OR NOT.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.600
THEY SAID AT MERCY
THAT WE HAD TO COME HERE

07:21.633 --> 07:23.600
BECAUSE HER CONDITION
COULD BE SERIOUS.

07:23.633 --> 07:25.800
I-IS IT SERIOUS?
I'VE GOT TO SAY,
AT FIRST GLANCE,

07:25.833 --> 07:27.633
YOU DON'T SEEM
EMERGENT ENOUGH FOR MERCY

07:27.667 --> 07:29.567
TO SEND YOU OVER HERE
IN AN AMBULANCE.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.500
YOU'RE NOT IN LABOR,
YOU'RE NOT BLEEDING,

07:31.533 --> 07:33.467
YOUR VITALS ARE FINE.
THEY SAID I NEED A SPECIALIST
BECAUSE OF MY THING.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.200
YOUR THING?
TWO UTERUSES?!

07:36.233 --> 07:40.100
MS. LABATT, UH, NOELLE
WAS BORN WITH TWO UTERUSES.

07:40.133 --> 07:41.600
UH, UTERI?

07:41.633 --> 07:43.200
UTERUSES.
UTERUSES.

07:43.233 --> 07:45.233
THAT'S VERY RARE.

07:46.733 --> 07:49.467
I'M HERE. HI. HELLO.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.467
THAT PAPERWORK TOOK--
WELL, FOREVER.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.467
BUT I'M ALL DONE WITH IT NOW,

07:53.500 --> 07:55.400
AND CAN I JUST SAY HOW...

07:55.433 --> 07:57.333
REALLY GRATEFUL I AM
TO BE BACK?

07:57.367 --> 08:00.367
YOU UNDERSTAND THERE ARE RULES
TO YOUR PROBATION,

08:00.400 --> 08:02.067
A PROTOCOL TO FOLLOW?

08:02.100 --> 08:03.100
OH, YEAH, I KNOW.

08:03.133 --> 08:06.167
LEGAL ALREADY TOOK ME
THROUGH LOTS OF THAT STUFF--

08:06.200 --> 08:08.200
THE MANDATORY COUNSELING,
THE EXTRA LAB HOURS,

08:08.233 --> 08:10.133
THE VOLUNTEER WORK
WITH TRANSPLANT PATIENTS.

08:10.167 --> 08:12.067
THAT'S THE STUFF
YOU'RE DOING FOR THE CHIEF.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.567
I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT
YOU'RE DOING FOR ME.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.333
OKAY, UH...
WHAT AM I DOING FOR YOU?

08:17.367 --> 08:20.100
OKAY, LET'S START WITH
WHAT YOU DON'T GET TO DO.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.200
YOU WILL NOT INTERACT
WITH ANY PATIENTS.

08:22.233 --> 08:24.133
YOU WILL NOT BE ALONE
WITH ANY PATIENTS.

08:24.167 --> 08:27.067
YOU WILL BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD.
YOU WILL PERFORM NO PROCEDURES.

08:27.067 --> 08:28.233
THE O.R. IS OFF LIMITS.

08:28.267 --> 08:29.767
NO PRE-OP, NO POST-OP,

08:29.800 --> 08:31.767
NO ANYTHING HAVE TO DO
WITH AN "OP."

08:31.800 --> 08:33.700
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY,
YOU HAVE NO OPINIONS

08:33.733 --> 08:36.367
AND YOU HAVE NO CHOICE
IN THIS MATTER.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.600
AM I UNDERSTOOD?

08:37.633 --> 08:39.533
IS... THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO?

08:39.567 --> 08:41.200
I WANT TO BE USEFUL.

08:41.233 --> 08:44.500
WELL... I CAN'T USE YOU.

08:44.533 --> 08:46.433
YOU'VE GOT TO EARN BACK
THE RIGHT

08:46.467 --> 08:48.367
FOR ANY OF US
TO TRUST YOU AGAIN.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.267
UNTIL THEN, YOU WILL BE
SHADOWING A DIFFERENT DOCTOR

08:51.300 --> 08:53.600
EACH DAY.
OKAY, WELL, WHO AM I WITH TODAY,
DR. MONTGOMERY, YOU?

08:53.633 --> 08:55.800
DR. BAILEY, YOU PAGED.
DR. GREY.

08:55.833 --> 08:56.800
MEREDITH?

08:56.833 --> 09:00.567
YOU'RE TO MAKE SURE
THAT STEVENS OBSERVES ONLY.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.300
YOU WANT ME TO...

09:03.333 --> 09:06.300
(chuckles) WAIT,
MEREDITH...

09:06.333 --> 09:08.567
MEREDITH IS THE BOSS
OF ME?

09:10.233 --> 09:17.800
HMM.

09:19.567 --> 09:20.700
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS.

09:20.733 --> 09:22.433
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

09:22.467 --> 09:24.367
HEY, YOU WANT ME
TO FETCH YOU SOME COFFEE,

09:24.400 --> 09:26.300
RUB YOUR FEET MAYBE?
I DID NOT ASK
FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.233
I'M FINE WITH IT.
REALLY, IT'S FINE.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.400
OH, I'M SO SORRY.
DR. STEVENS--

09:29.433 --> 09:31.300
HEY, DR. SHEPHERD.
WELCOME BACK.

09:31.333 --> 09:33.733
OKAY.
UH, MEREDITH,
MEREDITH--

09:33.767 --> 09:34.900
SORRY, IT'S NOT LIKE
I CAN LEAVE.

09:34.933 --> 09:37.067
I GOTTA STAY BY
MY BOSS' SIDE.
OKAY, THE TRAILER SUCKS,

09:37.100 --> 09:38.533
BUT IN THE LIGHT OF DAY,
THE LAND'S NICE.

09:38.567 --> 09:40.567
SEATTLE'S PRETTY
IN THE DAYLIGHT,

09:40.600 --> 09:42.700
PLUS YOU HAVE YOUR THING
FOR FERRIES, SO...

09:42.733 --> 09:44.533
(Derek and Meredith)
FERRY BOATS.
RIGHT. WHATEVER.

09:44.567 --> 09:47.400
DR. STEVENS, UH, MEREDITH,
THIS IS MY SISTER NANCY.

09:47.433 --> 09:49.067
OH, HI.
SISTER?

09:49.100 --> 09:51.067
YEAH. MM-HMM.

09:51.100 --> 09:53.667
OH. (laughs) YOU'RE ONE
OF DEREK'S SISTERS.

09:53.700 --> 09:56.167
YEAH, WELL, I KNEW YOU DIDN'T
THINK I WAS THE WIFE

09:56.200 --> 09:58.567
SEEING AS YOU ALREADY
RAN HER OFF.
NANCY IS VISITING
FROM CONNECTICUT.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.700
SHE'S ON HER WAY HOME NOW,
STRAIGHT BACK HOME.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.533
WELL, IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.300
OKAY.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.633
McDREAMY'S SISTER'S
McBITCHY.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.333
(elevator bell dings)

10:08.367 --> 10:10.267
YOU PUT ME IN CHARGE
OF YOUR SCHEDULE.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.433
TO MAKE SURE THAT I DIDN'T
GET A SURGERY LIKE THIS ONE.

10:12.467 --> 10:14.367
ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE
DO HUMPTIES, BURKE,

10:14.400 --> 10:17.267
AND YOU'RE THE BEST ONE
ON THE WEST COAST.
WELL, HE CAN GO TO HOUSTON.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.200
YOU WANT TO TELL THAT
TO THE CHIEF?

10:19.233 --> 10:21.600
PRUITT NEEDS THIS SURGERY.
HE'LL DIE WITHOUT IT.
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

10:21.633 --> 10:24.100
YOU TOLD THE PATIENT WE WERE
DOING THE SURGERY,

10:24.133 --> 10:26.433
BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.
I HAVE BEEN
DOING THAT ALL WEEK.

10:26.467 --> 10:27.800
ARE YOU UP ON THE HUMPTY?

10:27.833 --> 10:29.733
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT THIS ENTAILS?

10:29.767 --> 10:31.667
I HAVE DONE MY RESEARCH.
STOP WORRYING.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.700
WE ARE
A WELL-OILED MACHINE.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.333
(Miranda) UH, DR. BURKE.

10:39.367 --> 10:40.667
YEAH.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.033
I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE
SOME DOCTORS IN THIS HOSPITAL

10:43.067 --> 10:45.133
WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT
MY JUDGMENT SINCE DENNY.

10:45.167 --> 10:47.133
WELL, EVERYBODY LOVES
A SCANDAL.

10:47.167 --> 10:49.067
SO YOU THINK
IT'S JUST GOSSIP,

10:49.100 --> 10:51.700
NOT ACTUAL CONCERN ABOUT ME
AS A DOCTOR?

10:51.733 --> 10:54.600
SURE. SURE.

10:54.633 --> 10:56.467
(exhales)

10:56.500 --> 10:58.233
'CAUSE...

10:59.467 --> 11:02.467
OW. IZ, SET ME UP
FOR DEBRIDEMENT AND DRESSING.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.833
IT WAS STUPID.
I KNOW BETTER.

11:04.867 --> 11:06.700
WHEN I'M STUDYING FOR THE BAR,
I'M A MESS.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.633
I CAN'T FOCUS ON ANYTHING
FOR WEEKS

11:08.667 --> 11:10.567
BUT TORTS AND REAL PROPERTY
AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.500
UH, THE BIOSYNTHETIC ONES.

11:12.533 --> 11:14.067
WE NEVER USE THOSE.
WE DO NOW.

11:14.067 --> 11:16.700
SLOAN CHANGED
THE BURN PROTOCOL LAST WEEK.

11:16.733 --> 11:18.233
I WAS ABOUT TO START
A PRACTICE TEST,

11:18.267 --> 11:21.100
AND I WANTED SOME TEA,
SO I PUT ON A POT OF WATER

11:21.133 --> 11:23.067
AND HIT THE TIMER
AND JUST FORGOT.

11:23.067 --> 11:24.400
HALF AN HOUR INTO MY SECTION
ON CONTRACTS,

11:24.433 --> 11:26.833
THE SMOKE ALARM WAS BLARING,
AND WELL, YOU KNOW THE REST.

11:26.867 --> 11:28.800
SO YOU'RE GONNA BE A LAWYER?
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS PASS THE BAR EXAM.

11:28.833 --> 11:31.167
I FAILED BEFORE,
BUT THIS TIME I'M READY.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.767
I'M GONNA PASS.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.800
GOOD FOR YOU.

11:36.733 --> 11:37.833
THAT WAS JUST MEAN.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.767
KATHLEEN CALLED
AND TOLD ME TO FIND OUT

11:39.800 --> 11:41.800
WHY THE SLUTTY INTERN'S
PANTIES WERE HANGING

11:41.833 --> 11:44.267
ON THE HOSPITAL BULLETIN BOARD.
FOUR SISTERS--FOUR SISTERS
AND NOT ONE BROTHER,

11:44.300 --> 11:45.600
AND YOU WONDER WHY
I DON'T CALL MORE.

11:45.633 --> 11:47.533
FEEL FREE TO EXPLAIN ABOUT
THE PANTIES AT ANY TIME.

11:47.567 --> 11:49.467
NANCE, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.133
REALLY GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.
BUT I HAVE A JOB, YOU KNOW?

11:52.167 --> 11:54.067
I HAVE PATIENTS.
I HAVE A MOTHER
AT 35 WEEKS WITH TWINS.

11:54.067 --> 11:55.633
WHERE IS HER O.B.?
WELL, HER O.B. SHOULD BE

11:55.667 --> 11:57.567
ON A PLANE BACK TO CONNECTICUT
WHERE SHE BELONGS.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.433
OKAY, SO WE'VE COVERED
THE TRAILER.

11:59.467 --> 12:01.367
WE STILL NEED TO COVER
THE SLUTTY INTERN

12:01.400 --> 12:03.300
AND THE DIVORCE.

12:03.333 --> 12:05.767
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU SOUND MORE
AND MORE LIKE MOM EVERY DAY.
TAKE IT BACK.

12:05.800 --> 12:10.267
SO TWO UTERUSES...
THAT'S PRETTY COOL.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.433
AND YOU'RE ENGAGED.
THAT'S ALSO COOL.

12:12.467 --> 12:14.133
WELL, GREG
TALKED ME INTO IT.

12:14.167 --> 12:17.267
OH, MAN, FROM THE FIRST MOMENT
I SAW NOELLE, I WAS HAM.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.200
DID YOU JUST SAY "HAM"?

12:19.233 --> 12:21.167
YOU'RE EITHER HAM OR EGGS.
HERE WE GO.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.533
YOU GOTTA ASK YOURSELF
IN EVERY SITUATION,

12:23.567 --> 12:25.833
ARE YOU THE CHICKEN
OR ARE YOU THE PIG?
SORRY, PIG OR CHICKEN?

12:25.867 --> 12:27.733
LOOK, YOU GOT A PLATE
OF HAM AND EGGS, ALL RIGHT?

12:27.767 --> 12:30.500
NOW--NOW THE CHICKEN
IS INVOLVED IN THE MEAL,

12:30.533 --> 12:32.433
BUT THE PIG--
NOW THE PIG IS COMMITTED.

12:32.467 --> 12:34.367
SO THE QUESTION IS--
ARE YOU INVOLVED

12:34.400 --> 12:36.067
OR ARE YOU COMMITTED?

12:36.100 --> 12:38.833
HAM OR EGGS.

12:38.867 --> 12:40.800
HAM OR EGGS.

12:40.833 --> 12:42.700
(Noelle laughs)

12:42.733 --> 12:44.233
KAREV, YOU FREE?

12:44.267 --> 12:45.600
ABSOLUTELY, SIR.

12:45.633 --> 12:47.533
GREAT, TAKE THIS.
I'M ON HOLD WITH THE D.M.V.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.467
SOME MIX-UP ABOUT SWITCHING
MY LICENSE AND REGISTRATION

12:49.500 --> 12:50.833
TO SEATTLE.

12:50.867 --> 12:52.767
TAKE CARE OF THAT FOR ME?

12:52.800 --> 12:54.700
THANKS
FOR THINKING OF ME, SIR.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.200
O'MALLEY, HOW'S IT FEEL
TO BE THE NEW GYNIE GRUNT?

12:57.233 --> 12:59.133
OH, I GOT A PATIENT
WHO WAS BORN WITH

12:59.167 --> 13:02.433
AND IS PREGNANT IN
TWO UTERUSES.

13:02.467 --> 13:04.800
TWO UTERUSES. JEALOUS?

13:04.833 --> 13:07.200
NO. NO, I'M--I'M--

13:07.233 --> 13:09.500
I'M BUSY. I'M ON HOLD.
OH.

13:09.533 --> 13:11.067
YEAH, IMPORTANT BUSINESS.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.067
RIGHT.

13:12.067 --> 13:13.367
FOR SLOAN.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.767
RIGHT, IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT,
I'M SURE.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.267
NOELLE LABATT, ROOM 2314.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.200
* TWO, TWO, TWO,
TWO, TWO, TWO *

13:18.233 --> 13:20.400
HANG ON. CAN I SEE THAT
FOR A SEC?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.500
DID I JUST HEAR HIM SAY
"TWO UTERUSES"?

13:22.533 --> 13:25.467
I'M SORRY. YOU--
YOU MUST BE...

13:25.500 --> 13:27.400
NANCY-PANTS?

13:27.433 --> 13:29.300
HEY, LOSER.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.667
I WISH DEREK HAD TOLD ME
YOU WERE COMING TO VISIT.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.100
OH, LIKE HE TELLS YOU
ANYTHING THESE DAYS?

13:33.133 --> 13:35.833
YEAH, WELL,
I'M WORKING ON THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, MARK?

13:35.867 --> 13:38.767
ARE YOU TRYING
TO TORTURE HIM?
HE'S MY FAMILY, NANCY.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.667
PLUS, I NEEDED
A CHANGE OF PACE.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.600
PLUS, I SLEPT WITH
MY TENNIS PARTNER'S WIFE,

13:43.633 --> 13:45.533
AND HE WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT A GUN.

13:45.567 --> 13:48.300
THERE IT IS.
(Addison) OH, MY GOD.

13:48.333 --> 13:49.533
NANCY!

13:49.567 --> 13:53.100
(chuckles) LET ME GUESS.
DID MOM SEND YOU OUT?

13:53.133 --> 13:55.833
I HEAR DEREK'S TRYING
TO BAN YOU FROM SEATTLE.
DID HE ALSO TELL YOU THAT
HE'S LIVING IN A TRAILER?

13:55.867 --> 13:58.067
(laughs) YEAH.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.067
DEREK.

14:00.067 --> 14:02.467
OH, DEREK.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.067
I WANT TO SEE
THE TWO UTERUSES.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.733
YEAH, UM, FIND ME LATER.

14:06.767 --> 14:08.433
I MISS HER.

14:08.467 --> 14:11.100
YEAH...

14:11.133 --> 14:13.267
ME, TOO.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.200
THE DIESEL PUSHES PAST
CORNERBACK DON McNEAL.

14:15.233 --> 14:17.133
HE'S AT THE 30.
HE'S AT THE 20.

14:17.167 --> 14:20.233
HE'S AT THE 10.
TOUCHDOWN, WASHINGTON REDSKINS.

14:20.267 --> 14:22.567
I'M SORRY.
ONE OF THE TWINS GETS ROWDY,

14:22.600 --> 14:25.067
AND GREG GETS CARRIED AWAY
WHEN TALKING TO THE BABY.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.700
HE'S DECIDED THAT THE BABY
IS INTO SPORTS, OF ALL THINGS.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.333
WELL, SHE'S DADDY'S
LITTLE GIRL.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.733
I CAN TELL, SEE,
BECAUSE WHEN I TALK TO HER--

14:31.767 --> 14:34.567
YEAH, THE RHYTHM IN YOUR VOICE,
IT HELPS CALM HER. SURE.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.500
I READ A COUPLE OF ARTICLES
ON THAT RECENTLY, ACTUALLY.

14:36.533 --> 14:38.433
DR. KAREV, I KNEW YOU
SECRETLY MISSED MY SERVICE.

14:38.467 --> 14:39.400
RIGHT.

14:39.433 --> 14:41.333
GREG, NOELLE, I HAVE
VERY GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

14:41.367 --> 14:43.333
ACCORDING TO OUR TESTS,
THE BABIES ARE BOTH

14:43.367 --> 14:45.533
PERFECTLY HEALTHY.

14:45.567 --> 14:47.467
BUT THEY ARE
SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT SIZES

14:47.500 --> 14:49.067
FOR A VERY UNIQUE REASON.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.767
THE TEST INDICATE
THAT THE BABIES HAVE

14:50.800 --> 14:52.700
TWO DIFFERENT DUE DATES.
(George) ACCORDING TO
OUR CALCULATIONS,

14:52.733 --> 14:55.600
THE LARGER BABY, YOUR SON,
WAS CONCEIVED A FULL SIX WEEKS

14:55.633 --> 14:57.633
BEFORE YOUR DAUGHTER.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.267
I...
OH, GOD.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.200
I-I DON'T--
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:03.233 --> 15:05.133
THAT--THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

15:05.167 --> 15:06.267
NO, ACTUALLY,
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE.

15:06.300 --> 15:09.067
OUR TESTS ARE EXTREMELY ACCURATE
IN PREDICTING DUE DATES.

15:09.067 --> 15:10.800
BUT WE BROKE UP.
YEAH, SEE, SHE, UM,

15:10.833 --> 15:12.833
SHE GOT PREGNANT.

15:12.867 --> 15:14.700
I WANTED TO GET MARRIED.
SHE DIDN'T.

15:14.733 --> 15:17.767
I GAVE HER AN ULTIMATUM,
AND SHE LEFT ME.
GREG, I AM SO SORRY.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.467
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

15:19.500 --> 15:23.233
I MEAN, WE WERE BARELY SPEAKING
SIX WEEKS AFTER THE CONCEPTION,

15:23.267 --> 15:25.167
LET ALONE HAVING SEX.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.833
OR AT LEAST I WASN'T
HAVING SEX.

15:26.867 --> 15:28.800
IT WAS ONE NIGHT, GREG.
IT WAS ONE NIGHT.

15:28.833 --> 15:31.333
I-I DIDN'T THINK
THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN.

15:31.367 --> 15:33.767
IT WAS NOTHING.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.400
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.
OH...

15:36.433 --> 15:39.467
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

15:41.367 --> 15:44.767
HE'S NOT THE FATHER
OF BOTH BABIES.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.200
I JUST ACCIDENTALLY
BROKE THE NEWS

15:54.233 --> 15:56.800
OF MY PATIENT'S INFIDELITY
TO HER FIANCé.

15:56.833 --> 15:58.733
AND YET NO ONE
IS QUESTIONING

15:58.767 --> 16:00.667
YOUR COMPETENCE
AS A SURGEON.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.333
NO. WHAT?

16:02.367 --> 16:03.567
I NEED A BUTTON.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.500
I'M DOWN TO
MY LAST CLEAN SHIRT,

16:05.533 --> 16:09.233
AND I'M MISSING A BUTTON.

16:09.267 --> 16:10.500
ADELE ALWAYS HANDLED
MY BUTTONS.

16:10.533 --> 16:12.367
HAVE YOU CALLED HER?
ADELE?

16:12.400 --> 16:14.700
OH, NO, NO. I WOULDN'T
WANT TO BOTHER HER

16:14.733 --> 16:17.200
WITH SOMETHING AS TRIVIAL
AS A BUTTON.

16:17.233 --> 16:21.067
I DON'T SUPPOSE EITHER
OF YOU WOULD WANT TO...

16:21.100 --> 16:22.767
I'M SORRY.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.600
I HAVE TWO UTERUSES
I HAVE TO ATTEND TO.

16:25.633 --> 16:27.567
I HAVE MANY SKILLS,
MANY SKILLS,

16:27.600 --> 16:29.533
SURGICAL SKILLS.

16:29.567 --> 16:31.467
YOUR BUTTON RUPTURES
ITS ESOPHAGUS,

16:31.500 --> 16:33.133
I'M YOUR WOMAN.

16:33.167 --> 16:34.567
OTHERWISE...

16:42.167 --> 16:44.100
I HEAR YOU BURNED YOUR HAND
BECAUSE YOU WERE STUDYING?

16:44.133 --> 16:46.067
I CAN'T EVEN BE ALLOWED
TO WARM SOUP

16:46.067 --> 16:47.833
WITHIN FIVE DAYS
OF TAKING THE BAR.
SO YOU BURNED YOUR HAND
WHILE YOU WERE--

16:47.867 --> 16:50.267
BURNING MY SOUP.
AND WHEN YOU GRABBED
THE POT--

16:50.300 --> 16:52.567
DROPPED IT, OBVIOUSLY. I MEAN,
IT WAS LITERALLY RED HOT.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.500
YOU MUST HAVE HELD ON TO IT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE, THOUGH.

16:54.533 --> 16:57.100
THIS BURN'S EXTREMELY DEEP.
OH, YEAH. NO, THAT'S RIGHT.

16:57.133 --> 16:58.733
I HELD ON,
AND THEN I DROPPED IT.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.833
THERE ARE SOME DEEP
PARTIAL THICKNESS BURNS HERE.

17:00.867 --> 17:03.067
GIVE HER A GRAM OF CEFAZOLIN
AND A TETANUS.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.800
IT'S TOO BAD, REALLY,
THAT I DID THIS TO MY HAND.

17:05.833 --> 17:08.100
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING
THE BAR AGAIN FRIDAY.

17:08.133 --> 17:10.600
THIS BURN IS BAD,
BUT WE'LL GET YOU FIXED UP.

17:10.633 --> 17:13.700
YOU'LL BE FINE TO TAKE
THE TEST ON FRIDAY.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.433
I WILL?

17:17.433 --> 17:19.400
(Izzie) SHE'S LYING.

17:19.433 --> 17:21.300
SOMETHING'S OFF
ABOUT GRETCHEN'S STORY.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.833
IZZIE, YOU'RE ONLY
SUPPOSED TO BE OBSERVING.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.367
I AM OBSERVING.
I'M OBSERVING CLOSELY.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.600
AND I'M TELLING YOU
SOMETHING IS OFF.

17:26.633 --> 17:28.533
DID YOU SEE HER REACTION
WHEN SLOAN TOLD HER

17:28.567 --> 17:29.800
SHE'D BE OKAY TO TAKE
THE TEST AGAIN?

17:29.833 --> 17:32.833
THAT WAS NOT RELIEF.
THAT WAS PANIC.
IT'S OKAY TO BE NERVOUS

17:32.867 --> 17:34.800
ABOUT BEING BACK HERE
AT WORK, ABOUT FAILING,

17:34.833 --> 17:36.733
BUT YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
BEEN BACK A FULL DAY YET,

17:36.767 --> 17:38.667
AND ALREADY YOU'RE PUSHING
TO BEND THE RULES.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.600
MEREDITH,
THIS IS SO NOT ABOUT ME.

17:40.633 --> 17:42.133
THIS IS ABOUT OUR PATIENT.

17:42.167 --> 17:44.067
I AM WORRIED ABOUT
OUR PATIENT,

17:44.100 --> 17:45.467
AND GET OFF
YOUR HIGH FREAKIN' HORSE.

17:45.500 --> 17:48.067
THIS IS MY PATIENT.
TRY TO REMEMBER THAT.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.233
FINE. WHATEVER.

17:50.267 --> 17:52.067
IZ.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.533
A HUMPTY DUMPTY SURGERY?

17:59.567 --> 18:01.733
B-BURKE'S DOING
A HUMPTY DUMPTY TODAY?

18:01.767 --> 18:03.767
UM, YES.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.500
WELL, I'VE NEVER SEEN
A HUMPTY FIRSTHAND BEFORE.

18:06.533 --> 18:08.433
YEAH, ME NEITHER.

18:08.467 --> 18:09.567
UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:09.600 --> 18:11.700
SCRUBBING IN.

18:11.733 --> 18:15.167
YOU'LL LET BURKE KNOW?
SURE.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.800
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT TALKING
TO ME ANYMORE, AND THAT'S OKAY,

18:21.833 --> 18:23.733
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN.

18:23.767 --> 18:26.267
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS LISTEN.

18:26.300 --> 18:29.367
YOU AND ME,
WE'RE LIKE HAM AND EGGS.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.300
I WAS THE CHICKEN.
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

18:31.333 --> 18:33.233
THAT I KNOW
THAT I WAS THE CHICKEN.

18:33.267 --> 18:35.400
YOU PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE
AND YOU WERE COMMITTED,

18:35.433 --> 18:37.667
AND I WAS JUST PUTTING
THE EGGS ON THE PLATE.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.067
NOT THE HAM,
BECAUSE YOU WERE THE PIG.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.133
I WAS INVOLVED,
BUT NOW I'M COMMITTED.
DID YOU JUST CALL ME A PIG?

18:41.167 --> 18:43.067
NO, IT'S A METAPHOR.
CALLING ME A PIG?

18:43.067 --> 18:45.500
THE POINT IS, YOU'RE NOT
THE PIG ANYMORE.

18:45.533 --> 18:49.067
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS
I'M THE PIG. NOW I AM THE PIG.

18:53.267 --> 18:55.667
I AM THE PIG.

18:58.167 --> 19:01.767
***

19:01.800 --> 19:03.700
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU GUYS

19:03.733 --> 19:05.633
FOR A HALF AN HOUR
IN THE CAFETERIA.

19:05.667 --> 19:07.567
SINCE WHEN DO WE EAT
IN A PATIENT ROOM?

19:07.600 --> 19:08.800
IZZIE, MEET REALLY OLD GUY.

19:08.833 --> 19:10.733
WE FOUND HIM A COUPLE
OF DAYS AGO.

19:10.767 --> 19:12.667
(whispers)
HE SLEEPS ALL THE TIME.

19:12.700 --> 19:16.067
IT'S QUIET IN HERE.
NOBODY BOTHERS US.

19:17.533 --> 19:19.467
NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:19.500 --> 19:21.400
IT TURNS OUT
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

19:21.433 --> 19:23.333
I'M LITERALLY NOT ALLOWED
TO DO ANYTHING.

19:23.367 --> 19:25.267
I KNEW COMING BACK
WAS GONNA BE AN ADJUSTMENT,

19:25.300 --> 19:27.200
BUT THIS IS JUST--
NO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING
RIGHT NOW?

19:27.233 --> 19:29.133
EATING MY LUNCH.
OKAY,
IF YOU WANT TO SOCIALIZE

19:29.167 --> 19:31.733
OR TALK ABOUT YOUR DAY OR GET IN
A QUICK THERAPY SESSION,

19:31.767 --> 19:33.667
YOU KNOW,
GO DO IT OVER THERE.
SERIOUSLY?

19:33.700 --> 19:35.067
GOOD-BYE, IZZIE.
OKAY, FINE.

19:35.067 --> 19:37.500
SO, O'MALLEY, YOUR CHICK
WITH THE TWO UTERUSES?

19:37.533 --> 19:40.267
YOU'RE ON SCUT--
GLORIFIED PLASTICS SCUT.

19:40.300 --> 19:43.100
YOU ARE IN NO POSITION
TO MOCK ME OR MY UTERUSES.

19:43.133 --> 19:45.400
ANY CERVICAL CHANGES
ON THE ULTRASOUND?
WHY DO YOU CARE?

19:45.433 --> 19:48.133
I DON'T.
I'M SO GLAD TO BE BACK.

19:48.167 --> 19:50.267
YAY! I'M NOT COMPLAINING
ABOUT YOU.

19:50.300 --> 19:51.700
YOU AND I ARE FINE, BOSS.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.567
(man groans)

19:53.600 --> 19:55.133
(breathes raspily)

19:55.167 --> 19:57.400
(exhales)

19:57.433 --> 19:59.733
(sighs)

19:59.767 --> 20:02.367
THIS IS WEIRD.
I CALLED CALLIE A PIG.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.567
(laughs) TO HER FACE?
(Izzie laughs)

20:04.600 --> 20:06.567
(Meredith) WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE WHOLE SHE'S A CORPSE THING?

20:06.600 --> 20:09.467
I JUST CAN'T GET OVER
HOW MUCH EVERYTHING AROUND HERE

20:09.500 --> 20:10.800
HAS CHANGED.
HOW MANY TIMES?
JUST ONE TIME.

20:10.833 --> 20:12.767
I GET ONE, TOO, THEN.
DEAL.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.267
GIN.
WH--

20:14.300 --> 20:16.200
***

20:16.233 --> 20:18.133
WHAT WAS, UH, WITH THAT,
WITH MEREDITH?

20:18.167 --> 20:21.567
WE HAVE A THING.
WAIT, YOU HAVE A THING
WITH MEREDITH

20:21.600 --> 20:23.367
AND I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT IT?

20:23.400 --> 20:25.700
I LIVE WITH YOU.
I SEE YOU EVERY DAY.
IT'S A WORK THING.

20:25.733 --> 20:28.167
OKAY, YOU KNOW,
THE WHOLE POINT OF HANGING OUT

20:28.200 --> 20:30.333
WITH REALLY OLD GUY
IS THAT HE DOESN'T TALK.

20:30.367 --> 20:32.467
THE MAN IS SEDATED. THIS IS
SUPPOSED TO BE A QUIET PLACE.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.167
SEE? CHANGED.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.200
SHE'S CHANGED.

20:37.233 --> 20:38.767
EVERYTHING'S CHANGED.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.167
I GAVE THE OTHER NURSE A LIST
OF HIS MEDICATIONS THIS MORNING.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.667
MY HUSBAND NEEDS HIS PILLS.
HE NEEDED THEM HOURS AGO!

20:44.700 --> 20:47.733
OH, OH, OKAY. WHY DON'T YOU
CHECK ON THE MEDS AGAIN?

20:47.767 --> 20:49.700
I HAVE CHECKED ON THEM.
NO, MEDS, PHARMACY, NOW.

20:49.733 --> 20:51.433
JUST...

20:51.467 --> 20:53.267
I'M SORRY. I AM SORRY.

20:53.300 --> 20:54.500
IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE.

20:54.533 --> 20:57.067
I WAS NEVER
A YELLER BEFORE.

20:57.100 --> 20:58.433
I'M BECOMING
THIS HORRIBLE PERSON

20:58.467 --> 21:00.700
WHO YELLS AT PEOPLE
WHO ARE JUST TRYING

21:00.733 --> 21:02.600
TO DO THEIR JOB.

21:02.633 --> 21:05.500
YOU ARE JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR YOUR HUSBAND.

21:05.533 --> 21:08.100
YOU DO EXACTLY WHAT IT TAKES
TO PROTECT HIM,

21:08.133 --> 21:10.067
AND THAT DOES NOT
MAKE YOU HORRIBLE.

21:10.067 --> 21:13.067
IT MAKES YOU SMART.

21:38.067 --> 21:39.600
HE SAID HE WAS LEAVING.

21:39.633 --> 21:41.533
HE SAID HE WASN'T COMING BACK.
SHE'S HYPERVENTILATING,

21:41.567 --> 21:43.200
AND THE BABY'S HAD
SOME BRADYCARDIA.

21:43.233 --> 21:45.400
(Addison) NOELLE, I NEED YOU
TO GET BACK INTO BED NOW.

21:45.433 --> 21:47.500
IS GREG OUT THERE? DID HE LEAVE?
LIKE REALLY LEAVE?
JUST TAKE DEEP BREATHS.

21:47.533 --> 21:49.433
I ALWAYS GIVE HIM
SUCH A HARD TIME,

21:49.467 --> 21:51.133
YOU KNOW, ABOUT EVERYTHING.

21:51.167 --> 21:52.767
LIKE HE LIKES WEDDINGS.
I HATE THEM.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.700
HE LOVES KIDS, AND ME,
THEY SCARE ME TO DEATH.

21:54.733 --> 21:56.200
NOELLE, HAVE YOU HAD
ANY CRAMPING,

21:56.233 --> 21:58.433
ANY CONTRACTIONS,
ANY PRESSURE AT ALL?
BUT I CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT HIM.

21:58.467 --> 22:01.533
WE'LL GET PAST THIS, RIGHT?
WE HAVE TO GET PAST THIS. AAH!
DAMN IT.

22:01.567 --> 22:03.600
ALL RIGHT, NOELLE, I NEED YOU
TO GET INTO BED, OKAY?
OW! OW!

22:03.633 --> 22:06.600
WHY, WHAT'S HAPPENING? OW!
STAY ON YOUR LEFT SIDE,

22:06.633 --> 22:08.600
AND WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO NOT PUSH, OKAY?

22:08.633 --> 22:10.300
(breathing heavily)

22:10.333 --> 22:12.367
OKAY, I NEED SLOW,
DEEP BREATHS.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.833
SO TELL ME ABOUT
THE SLUTTY GIRL.

22:14.867 --> 22:18.267
FINE, THE SLUTTY INTERN.
IT WAS THE SLUTTY PART
I HAD A PROBLEM WITH.

22:18.300 --> 22:20.567
KATHLEEN SAYS
SHE'S NOT EVEN SINGLE.
SHE IS SINGLE.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.567
SHE'S WONDERFUL. SHE'S SMART.
SHE'S A LOT OF THINGS.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.500
AND SHE'S NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS, NANCY.

22:24.533 --> 22:26.633
WOW, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
LIKE THIS OVER A GIRL,

22:26.667 --> 22:28.767
EVEN ADDISON.
I'VE NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS
OVER A GIRL,

22:28.800 --> 22:30.500
ESPECIALLY ADDISON.

22:30.533 --> 22:33.400
OH, DON'T BE BITTER. I MEAN,
SHAME ON ADDISON AND ALL THAT,

22:33.433 --> 22:35.333
BUT HE'S MARK, DEREK.
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

22:35.367 --> 22:36.333
HE'S JUST... MARK.

22:36.367 --> 22:40.367
AND WHO HASN'T GONE THERE
ONCE OR TWICE, RIGHT?

22:42.333 --> 22:44.133
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
OH, COME ON.
EVERYBODY SLEEPS WITH MARK.

22:44.167 --> 22:47.067
IT'S PRACTICALLY
A RITE OF PASSAGE.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.700
DEREK, I GET IT, OKAY?

22:48.733 --> 22:50.633
I GET THAT THEY MADE
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

22:50.667 --> 22:53.533
IT WASN'T A MISTAKE.
NANCY, IT WASN'T A MISTAKE.

22:53.567 --> 22:55.567
IT WASN'T JUST ONE NIGHT.
IT WAS MONTHS.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.467
THEY WERE TOGETHER FOR MONTHS.
DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT?

22:58.500 --> 23:00.367
NO, I HAD NO IDEA.

23:00.400 --> 23:03.800
THEN SHUT UP ABOUT IT
AND EAT YOUR LUNCH.

23:13.700 --> 23:17.600
DEREK'S SISTER IS IN TOWN.

23:17.633 --> 23:19.533
CRISTINA, ARE YOU MAD
AT ME OR SOMETHING?

23:19.567 --> 23:22.433
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO TALK TO YOU ALL WEEK.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.367
EVERYTHING IS NOT
ABOUT YOU, MEREDITH.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.200
OKAY, WHAT IS GOING ON?

23:26.233 --> 23:28.233
BECAUSE GEORGE AND ALEX
ARE SAYING--
I-I DON'T CARE.

23:28.267 --> 23:30.067
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
I JUST...

23:30.100 --> 23:33.767
I HAVE BIGGER THINGS
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

23:33.800 --> 23:37.500
***

23:52.267 --> 23:55.267
***

24:02.733 --> 24:04.500
WHAT?

24:08.467 --> 24:10.400
NOTHING.

24:10.433 --> 24:11.833
10 BLADE.

24:11.867 --> 24:15.333
***

24:17.133 --> 24:18.667
HEY. HEY, DR. O'MALLEY.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.800
CAN YOU, UH, CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THERE?

24:20.833 --> 24:22.733
I THOUGHT YOU LEFT.
SHE THINKS YOU LEFT HER.

24:22.767 --> 24:25.067
LOOK, MAN, THIS IS ALL
A LOT TO DIGEST.

24:25.100 --> 24:26.833
I MEAN, OUR DAUGHTER,
MY--MY LITTLE GIRL

24:26.867 --> 24:29.300
ISN'T EVEN
MY LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE.

24:29.333 --> 24:31.500
NOELLE IS IN THERE
FREAKING OUT BECAUSE YOU LEFT.

24:31.533 --> 24:35.100
JUST TELL ME
IF SHE IS OKAY, PLEASE.

24:35.133 --> 24:36.333
SHE'S GONE INTO
PREMATURE LABOR.

24:36.367 --> 24:37.833
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD--

24:37.867 --> 24:40.700
DR. MONTGOMERY IS ABOUT TO DO
AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION

24:40.733 --> 24:42.067
ON ONE OF THE BABIES

24:42.100 --> 24:43.833
TO TRY TO STOP THE LABOR
ON THE OTHER.

24:43.867 --> 24:46.500
WAIT, SO YOU'RE DELIVERING
ONE OF THE BABIES RIGHT NOW,

24:46.533 --> 24:48.600
TODAY?
IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.

24:48.633 --> 24:51.300
THE BOY OR THE GIRL?

24:51.333 --> 24:52.600
GREG...

24:52.633 --> 24:55.200
HAM OR EGGS?

24:55.233 --> 24:58.300
***

25:02.433 --> 25:05.700
***

25:05.733 --> 25:08.133
YOU SAY YOU WANT A CAREER
IN PLASTICS,

25:08.167 --> 25:09.700
AND YET YOU CAN'T
TEAR YOURSELF AWAY

25:09.733 --> 25:11.633
FROM THE BABY CATCHERS
LONG ENOUGH

25:11.667 --> 25:13.733
TO ACTUALLY SHOW ME
YOU WANT IT.
BEING ON HOLD
WITH THE D.M.V.

25:13.767 --> 25:16.600
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A CAREER
IN PLASTICS, DR. SLOAN.

25:16.633 --> 25:18.667
ONLY IT DOES, BECAUSE BEING
ON HOLD WITH THE D.M.V.

25:18.700 --> 25:20.367
HAS TO DO WITH ME,

25:20.400 --> 25:23.533
AND I HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR CAREER IN PLASTICS.

25:28.800 --> 25:29.900
TYLER...

25:29.933 --> 25:32.100
ADDISON MONTGOMERY NEEDS
TWO UNITS OF B-POSITIVE BLOOD

25:32.133 --> 25:34.767
IN L&D, STAT.
I'M ON IT.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.400
SO THE BIOSYNTHETIC DRESSING
SHOULD ENSURE

25:42.433 --> 25:44.333
THAT YOU WON'T NEED
SKIN GRAFTS,

25:44.367 --> 25:45.533
AND THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

25:45.567 --> 25:47.833
IF I DID NEED GRAFTS,
WOULD THAT TAKE LONG?

25:47.867 --> 25:50.300
I MEAN, I MEAN, LIKE HOW LONG
WOULD SOMETHING LIKE THAT TAKE

25:50.333 --> 25:53.233
IF--IF I HAD NEEDED THEM?
UH, THAT WOULD JUST DEPEND

25:53.267 --> 25:55.067
ON THE SEVERITY
OF THE BURN, REALLY.

25:55.067 --> 25:56.533
OH, SO MORE SEVERE
THAN THIS ONE?

25:56.567 --> 25:59.433
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
MORE SEVERE?

25:59.467 --> 26:01.767
(clears throat)

26:01.800 --> 26:04.267
JUST TO MAKE SURE I HAVE
EVERYTHING ACCURATE,

26:04.300 --> 26:07.433
UH, YOU BURNED YOUR HAND...

26:07.467 --> 26:11.167
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS,
HAVEN'T WE?
UH, I'M SORRY. I--

26:11.200 --> 26:13.800
LOOK, I HAVE A TEST ON FRIDAY,
AND I HAVE WORK TO DO.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.733
SO I HAVE TO--
I-I WANT TO GO HOME.

26:15.767 --> 26:18.267
I'M REALLY READY TO GET
OUT OF HERE NOW, OKAY?
I'M SORRY.

26:18.300 --> 26:20.167
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--
GRETCHEN, DID YOU BURN
YOUR HAND ON PURPOSE?

26:20.200 --> 26:23.700
IZZIE, YOU HEARD
WHAT DR. BAILEY SAID.
IT'S OKAY IF YOU DID.

26:23.733 --> 26:26.433
IT'S JUST, DID YOU
BURN YOUR HAND

26:26.467 --> 26:28.467
TO GET OUT OF TAKING
YOUR TEST?

26:36.300 --> 26:39.167
I CAN'T FAIL THAT DAMN TEST
ONE MORE TIME.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.367
I JUST... CAN'T.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.300
IT'S ALL
ANYONE IN MY FAMILY,

26:42.333 --> 26:44.233
IN MY LIFE--
IT'S ALL THEY TALK ABOUT.

26:44.267 --> 26:45.733
IT'S ALL I'M KNOWN FOR.

26:45.767 --> 26:48.600
"OH, GRETCHEN, THE FAILURE."

26:48.633 --> 26:51.500
CAN YOU IMAGINE FAILING
THE BAR EXAM FIVE TIMES?

26:51.533 --> 26:53.433
FIVE TIMES.

26:53.467 --> 26:55.233
I MEAN, THAT'S ABSURD.

26:55.267 --> 26:59.300
(laughs) I MEAN...
THAT'S JUST, UH...

26:59.333 --> 27:02.200
THAT'S PATHETIC.

27:02.233 --> 27:03.733
I CANNOT SIT

27:03.767 --> 27:07.067
FOR TWO AND A HALF
SOLID DAYS OF TESTING AGAIN

27:07.067 --> 27:10.133
JUST TO PROVE TO EVERYONE...

27:10.167 --> 27:12.200
AGAIN...

27:13.767 --> 27:16.633
HOW PATHETIC I AM.

27:16.667 --> 27:19.667
NOT... WHEN...

27:19.700 --> 27:22.733
YOU FEEL THAT PATHETIC
ALL BY YOURSELF.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.067
(Addison) OKAY, I'VE
COMPLETED THE INCISION.

27:39.067 --> 27:41.767
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO MOVE
THE TOP UTERUS TO THE SIDE

27:41.800 --> 27:44.233
SO I CAN REACH
THE ONE UNDERNEATH.
(George) GOT IT.

27:44.267 --> 27:46.167
NOW I DON'T WANT
TO ALARM YOU

27:46.200 --> 27:48.167
OR MAKE YOU NERVOUS
IN ANY WAY, O'MALLEY,

27:48.200 --> 27:50.100
BECAUSE YOU SEEM LIKE
A DECENT PERSON,

27:50.133 --> 27:52.067
BUT I'VE GOT
ABOUT 120 SECONDS

27:52.067 --> 27:53.800
TO GET BABY ONE
OUT OF UTERUS ONE

27:53.833 --> 27:55.500
WHILE YOU'RE HOLDING
UTERUS TWO,

27:55.533 --> 27:58.300
AND IF YOU SO MUCH
AS HICCUP,

27:58.333 --> 28:01.200
YOU COULD TEAR THE UTERINE WALL
AND KILL THIS WOMAN'S CHILD.

28:01.233 --> 28:05.067
SO DO WHAT YOU CAN
TO BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

28:05.067 --> 28:06.400
OKAY.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.800
WOW. LOOK AT THAT.

28:10.833 --> 28:14.200
AMAZING, HUH?

28:16.433 --> 28:19.767
(Cristina) APPLYING THE FINAL
HEMOSTASIS SUTURE.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.667
GREAT.
DON'T BE AFRAID TO--

28:22.700 --> 28:24.167
GRAB A BIGGER PIECE?
GOT IT.

28:24.200 --> 28:27.467
HMM. GOOD.
VERY NICE, DR. YANG.

28:27.500 --> 28:30.800
APPLYING PRESSURE.

28:30.833 --> 28:32.500
GENTLY.

28:41.200 --> 28:44.367
IT WAS ATTACHED TO
THE INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.267
ARE YOU GONNA USE A GRAFT
TO REPAIR?

28:45.300 --> 28:47.233
SOMEBODY'S BEEN DOING
THEIR HOMEWORK.

28:47.267 --> 28:48.633
4-0 PROLENE, PLEASE.

28:48.667 --> 28:51.533
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BOKI.

28:53.067 --> 28:56.633
READY TO PERFORATE
UTERUS TWO. SCALPEL.

28:56.667 --> 28:58.633
WAIT. WAIT, DR. MONTGOMERY.
MY BABY'S MOVING.

28:58.667 --> 29:01.400
IT'S REALLY MOVING.
I CAN'T HOLD IT.
GEORGE, I NEED YOU
TO HOLD HER STILL

29:01.433 --> 29:04.067
IF I'M GONNA DO
THIS C-SECTION.
I'M TRYING.

29:04.100 --> 29:06.100
I MEAN IT, O'MALLEY.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
IT'S REALLY MOVING.

29:06.133 --> 29:08.300
I CAN'T HOLD IT.
I NEED YOU
TO KEEP HER STILL, GEORGE.

29:08.333 --> 29:09.667
YOU'RE SENDING HER
INTO DISTRESS.

29:09.700 --> 29:11.467
YOU HAVE TO GET THAT BABY
TO STOP MOVING.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.100
HOW DO I DO THAT?
TALK, O'MALLEY.

29:13.133 --> 29:15.633
ALEX.
KAREV, BACK AWAY
FROM THE TABLE.

29:15.667 --> 29:17.533
TALK TO IT, TO THE BABY,
TO CALM IT DOWN.

29:17.567 --> 29:19.600
KAREV.
TALK ABOUT WHAT?

29:19.633 --> 29:21.100
OCTOBER 30, 1974--

29:21.133 --> 29:23.067
IT'S THE FIGHT KNOWN
AS "RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE."

29:23.100 --> 29:24.600
WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMP
GEORGE FOREMAN

29:24.633 --> 29:27.133
IS PITTED AGAINST MUHAMMAD ALI
IN HIS FIRST MAJOR FIGHT

29:27.167 --> 29:28.733
AFTER THREE AND A HALF YEARS
OUT OF THE RING.
IT'S WORKING.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.667
FOREMAN IS FAVORED TO WIN.
HE'S YOUNGER, HE'S STRONGER...

29:30.700 --> 29:33.267
SCALPEL.
BUT HE'S NOT PREPARED
FOR WHAT ALI WOULD LATER CALL

29:33.300 --> 29:35.600
THE ROPE-A-DOPE. IT ALL STARTED
IN THE SECOND ROUND.

29:35.633 --> 29:36.833
FOREMAN COMES OUT SWINGING.

29:36.867 --> 29:38.700
ALI'S BACKED UP
AGAINST THE ROPES...

29:47.133 --> 29:48.567
THAT'S NOT GONNA STAY ON.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.500
YOU'RE GIVING IT
TOO MUCH SLACK.

29:50.533 --> 29:52.667
YOU'RE BLOCKING MY LIGHT.

29:52.700 --> 29:54.700
THINK OF IT
AS A BASIC CORNER STITCH.

29:54.733 --> 29:57.600
I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO
SEW ON MY OWN BUTTONS,

29:57.633 --> 29:59.133
THANK YOU.

29:59.167 --> 30:01.067
I AM SURGEON.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.100
RIGHT.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.833
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES.

30:04.867 --> 30:06.800
YOU SEW THIS ON FOR ME,

30:06.833 --> 30:09.167
AND I'LL GET RID OF ADDISON
AND SLOAN.
REALLY?

30:09.200 --> 30:11.233
NO.
OH, FINE.
I'LL DO IT ANYWAY.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.533
SO I HEARD YOU'VE GOT
A SISTER WANDERING THE HALLS.

30:13.567 --> 30:16.433
SHE PLANNING ON
MOVING HERE, TOO?
GOD, I HOPE NOT.

30:16.467 --> 30:18.800
DEREK, I KNOW IT'S BEEN
HARD ON YOU.

30:18.833 --> 30:21.167
HE WAS LIKE MY BROTHER.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.667
I HAVE FOUR SISTERS...

30:23.700 --> 30:26.400
FOUR VERY ANNOYING SISTERS.

30:26.433 --> 30:28.033
MARK WAS MY BROTHER.

30:28.067 --> 30:30.767
IT'S--IT'S HARD.

30:30.800 --> 30:33.367
DIVORCE ISN'T ALL IT'S
CRACKED UP TO BE, HUH?

30:33.400 --> 30:35.300
I JUST WANT IT TO BE EASY.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.200
I WANT IT TO BE OVER
AND MOVE ON.

30:38.233 --> 30:39.733
BUT...

30:39.767 --> 30:43.167
BUT YOU'RE IN
A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF PAIN.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.833
YOU AND ADELE?

30:44.867 --> 30:48.033
I'M SEWING ON A BUTTON
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE.

30:48.067 --> 30:49.467
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

30:49.500 --> 30:54.200
(laughs) TECHNICALLY,
I'M SEWING.

30:54.233 --> 30:57.033
(chuckles) I'M JUST SAYING.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.167
DR. SLOAN.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.133
SO WE'RE CLEAR,

31:05.167 --> 31:07.067
YOU KNEW WHEN YOU STEPPED
INTO THAT SURGERY,

31:07.100 --> 31:09.100
YOU WERE FORFEITING YOUR FUTURE
IN PLASTICS, RIGHT?

31:09.133 --> 31:11.567
BUT, DR. SLOAN--
I NEED MY PHONE BACK.

31:17.533 --> 31:19.200
WELL DONE.
MM.

31:19.233 --> 31:20.400
YOU REALLY PREPARED.

31:20.433 --> 31:23.067
YES, I'M ALWAYS PREPARED.

31:23.067 --> 31:25.367
COULDN'T DO IT
WITHOUT YOU.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.167
THANK YOU.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.533
DR. BURKE, UH, COULD WE
HAVE A MOMENT ALONE?

31:31.367 --> 31:32.833
I JUST--

31:32.867 --> 31:35.467
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT YOU WERE ONE OF THEM,

31:35.500 --> 31:37.400
ONE OF THE DOCTORS
AROUND HERE

31:37.433 --> 31:40.533
WITH DOUBTS ABOUT ME
OR MY ABILITIES.
MIRANDA, I'M NOT.

31:40.567 --> 31:42.633
MY NAME WAS ERASED
FROM THE BOARD.

31:42.667 --> 31:45.067
I HAVE TO ASSUME
THAT WAS YOU.

31:46.667 --> 31:48.800
DR. BAILEY--

31:48.833 --> 31:52.067
I JUST--I JUST--
I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHY.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.833
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME

31:53.867 --> 31:56.433
WHY YOU DIDN'T WANT ME IN
ON YOUR SURGERY.

32:00.433 --> 32:03.600
I'M AFRAID
I JUST COULDN'T USE YOU.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.233
I UNDERSTAND.

32:25.267 --> 32:27.533
OH, YOU SHOULD'VE
SEEN THAT.

32:27.567 --> 32:30.433
TWO UTERUSES.
SO UNBELIEVABLY COOL.

32:30.467 --> 32:32.767
AND A CUTE BABY TO BOOT.
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE
ENJOYING YOUR TRIP.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.700
RELAX, DEREK. I'M GOING.

32:34.733 --> 32:36.667
I'M ON A PLANE IN TWO HOURS.

32:36.700 --> 32:40.267
SO... YOU'RE GONNA REPORT
BACK TO MOM THAT?

32:40.300 --> 32:41.500
THAT YOU'RE YOU.
MM.

32:41.533 --> 32:44.367
STILL RUNNING IN CIRCLES AROUND
ALL THE WOMEN IN YOUR LIFE,

32:44.400 --> 32:47.067
BUT THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED
WITH FOUR SISTERS

32:47.100 --> 32:48.533
AND A DEAD DAD.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.233
I'M NOT RUNNING AROUND
IN CIRCLES.

32:50.267 --> 32:52.533
DEREK, CAN YOU EVEN REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE ALONE?

32:52.567 --> 32:54.467
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SINGLE,
EVER.

32:54.500 --> 32:55.833
I MEAN, YOU'RE FINE,

32:55.867 --> 32:57.367
BUT YOU'RE NOT HAPPY.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.300
AND YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET HAPPY

32:59.333 --> 33:01.300
UNTIL YOU GET SOME SPACE.

33:01.333 --> 33:04.300
JUST GET AWAY FROM ADDIE,
AWAY FROM THE INTERN,

33:04.333 --> 33:05.500
JUST AWAY.

33:05.533 --> 33:08.367
FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT.

33:09.767 --> 33:13.800
KATHLEEN'S THE SHRINK, NANCY,
NOT YOU.

33:15.833 --> 33:17.767
I GOTTA GO.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.467
NANCY.

33:23.800 --> 33:26.200
THANKS FOR FLYING OUT HERE.

33:26.233 --> 33:29.300
IT WAS, UH...

33:29.333 --> 33:32.400
THANKS.

33:32.433 --> 33:36.267
***

33:42.133 --> 33:44.333
(sighs)

33:44.367 --> 33:47.467
(Gretchen) WHERE ARE
WE GOING AGAIN?

33:47.500 --> 33:50.200
WE NEED TO GO UPSTAIRS.

33:50.233 --> 33:52.067
OKAY.

33:52.067 --> 33:54.500
***

33:54.533 --> 33:56.533
(elevator bell dings)

34:02.233 --> 34:05.733
WAIT. WAIT. WHERE ARE WE?

34:05.767 --> 34:07.567
WE'RE ON THE PSYCHIATRIC FLOOR,
GRETCHEN.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.500
WE NEED TO PLACE YOU ON
A 72-HOUR HOLD.

34:09.533 --> 34:11.433
NO, I'M NOT CRAZY.
YOU CAN'T--NO.

34:11.467 --> 34:13.567
I'M GOING HOME.

34:13.600 --> 34:14.433
GRETCHEN.

34:14.467 --> 34:17.100
NO, YOU HAVE TO
LET ME GO HOME. PLEASE.

34:17.133 --> 34:20.267
I'LL JUST--I NEED
TO GO BACK HOME. PLEASE.
IF YOU GO HOME, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HURT YOURSELF AGAIN.

34:20.300 --> 34:21.267
RIGHT?
ISN'T THAT YOUR PLAN,

34:21.300 --> 34:24.133
SO THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO
TAKE THE BAR EXAM?

34:24.167 --> 34:26.100
YOU NEED SOME HELP,
GRETCHEN.

34:26.133 --> 34:28.067
IF THE IDEA OF TAKING AN EXAM

34:28.067 --> 34:30.067
MAKES YOU HOLD YOUR PALM
TO A BURNER,

34:30.067 --> 34:31.400
YOU NEED SOME HELP.

34:31.433 --> 34:34.233
EVERYONE NEEDS HELP
FROM TIME TO TIME,

34:34.267 --> 34:37.600
SOMEONE TO LOOK OUT FOR THEM,
MAKE SURE THEY'RE OKAY,

34:37.633 --> 34:40.433
MAKE SURE THEY'RE READY.

34:40.467 --> 34:42.533
I HAVE THAT.

34:42.567 --> 34:44.667
AND YOU NEED THAT
RIGHT NOW.

34:44.700 --> 34:47.733
***

34:50.133 --> 34:52.100
I'M NOT CRAZY.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.067
I KNOW.

34:54.067 --> 34:56.433
I JUST...
DIDN'T WANT TO FAIL.

34:56.467 --> 34:58.733
I KNOW.

34:58.767 --> 35:01.767
***

35:08.867 --> 35:11.367
WHAT HAPPENED?

35:11.400 --> 35:14.067
ARE MY BABIES OKAY?

35:14.067 --> 35:16.833
THE SURGERY WENT VERY WELL.
YOU HAVE A HEALTHY BABY BOY.

35:16.867 --> 35:18.733
AND THE LABOR STOPPED
ON YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

35:18.767 --> 35:19.800
SHE'S GONNA BE JUST FINE.

35:19.833 --> 35:23.433
AND GREG?
HAS GREG COME BACK YET?

35:23.467 --> 35:26.467
NO, NOELLE, I'M SORRY.
GREG ISN'T HERE.

35:31.133 --> 35:33.267
I WANT AN UPDATE
EVERY HALF-HOUR, AND--

35:33.300 --> 35:35.433
WHAT HAPPENED?

35:37.167 --> 35:38.500
MY BABIES?
THEY'RE JUST FINE.

35:38.533 --> 35:40.433
YOU'RE JUST COMING OUT
OF ANESTHESIA, NOELLE.

35:40.467 --> 35:41.800
EVERYTHING WENT VERY WELL.

35:41.833 --> 35:43.333

35:43.367 --> 35:47.067
I'M SO SORRY, NOELLE.
HE'S NOT HERE.

35:50.367 --> 35:52.433
AND BE SURE TO ALERT ME
TO ANY FETAL DISTRESS.

35:52.467 --> 35:54.300
WHAT HAPPENED?

35:54.333 --> 35:56.433
YOUR BABIES ARE HEALTHY, NOELLE.
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

35:56.467 --> 35:58.833

36:06.700 --> 36:08.400
HI.

36:08.433 --> 36:09.933
HI.

36:13.667 --> 36:15.333
I, UM...

36:15.367 --> 36:18.200
I SAW OUR SON.

36:19.433 --> 36:21.100
HE'S AMAZING.

36:21.133 --> 36:25.767
***

36:25.800 --> 36:28.167
BUT HOW'S OUR LITTLE GIRL?

36:28.200 --> 36:30.667
***

36:39.633 --> 36:43.267
***

36:43.300 --> 36:46.167
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE CHEERING UP.

36:46.200 --> 36:47.667
NOT FROM YOU.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.200
OH, IF I RECALL,

36:49.233 --> 36:51.133
I WAS PRETTY GOOD
AT CHEERING YOU UP--

36:51.167 --> 36:55.567
ONE, TWO... YEP,
THREE VERY CHEERFUL TIMES.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.633
DIRTY. IT WAS NOT "CHEERFUL."
IT WAS DIRTY.

36:57.667 --> 37:00.700
AND LIKE I SAID, NO.

37:16.833 --> 37:19.067
SO YOUR SISTER REALLY
DOESN'T LIKE ME, HUH?

37:19.067 --> 37:21.500
SORRY. IT'S JUST, SHE'S...

37:21.533 --> 37:24.067
FROM THE EAST COAST.

37:26.167 --> 37:28.333
WELL, I--
I--

37:28.367 --> 37:29.833
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SHOULDA CALLED.

37:29.867 --> 37:32.667
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

37:32.700 --> 37:34.600
I WANT US TO WORK,
IT'S JUST--

37:34.633 --> 37:36.200
IT'S COMPLICATED.

37:40.133 --> 37:42.400
I THINK I NEED
A LITTLE TIME TO...

37:42.433 --> 37:44.400
TAKE SOME SPACE.

37:44.433 --> 37:46.800
YEAH.

37:46.833 --> 37:48.700
TO CLEAR MY HEAD.

37:48.733 --> 37:50.367
YEAH.

37:50.400 --> 37:53.467
I... OKAY.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.200
OKAY.

37:56.500 --> 37:59.067
OKAY.

38:00.567 --> 38:04.567
THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN EVEN THE BEST OF US

38:04.600 --> 38:07.233
HAVE TROUBLE WITH COMMITMENT.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.600
DR. STEVENS.

38:10.633 --> 38:13.100
I WAS JUST LOOKING
AT DR. GREY'S EVALUATION

38:13.133 --> 38:15.067
ON YOUR FIRST DAY
BACK TO WORK.

38:15.100 --> 38:16.833
I GET
DAILY REPORT CARDS NOW?

38:16.867 --> 38:18.400
SHE HAD A LOT TO SAY.

38:18.433 --> 38:20.333
YES, SIR.

38:20.367 --> 38:22.400
IT WAS A DIFFICULT CATCH.

38:22.433 --> 38:25.067
NICELY HANDLED.
GOOD WORK.

38:27.167 --> 38:29.400
WELCOME BACK, DR. STEVENS.

38:29.433 --> 38:32.433
***

38:38.233 --> 38:41.367
I WAS RUDE TO YOU BEFORE.
I'M SORRY.

38:43.433 --> 38:45.333
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO SAY.

38:45.367 --> 38:48.300
YOU'RE THE... PIG.
YOU ARE COMMITTED.

38:48.333 --> 38:50.633
***

38:50.667 --> 38:51.867
ONLY WE BROKE UP.

38:51.900 --> 38:55.067
AND I'VE BEEN WANTING TO HEAR
THIS FROM YOU FOR HOW LONG?

38:55.067 --> 38:57.700
AND--AND YOU WAIT UNTIL NOW
TO SAY IT TO ME

38:57.733 --> 38:59.267
AFTER WE'VE BROKEN UP?

38:59.300 --> 39:02.167
I'M OUT OF MY ELEMENT HERE.
I BREAK BONES FOR A LIVING.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.100
I-I USED TO LIVE
IN THE BASEMENT.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.333
MOST DAYS I WEAR
LAST NIGHT'S EYELINER TO WORK.

39:06.367 --> 39:08.400
I DON'T GIVE A CRAP WHAT
OTHER PEOPLE THINK ABOUT ME

39:08.433 --> 39:10.333
BECAUSE I AM A HAPPILY
INDEPENDENT, SUCCESSFUL WOMAN,

39:10.367 --> 39:12.267
AND I LIKE IT THAT WAY.

39:12.300 --> 39:15.533
ONLY WHEN YOU SAY STUFF
LIKE THIS, IT JUST...

39:15.567 --> 39:17.667
(sighs) IT JUST--
IT MAKES THINGS TOO HARD.

39:17.700 --> 39:19.367
SO PLEASE...

39:19.400 --> 39:22.733
DON'T CHASE ME ANYMORE...

39:23.800 --> 39:26.233
UNLESS YOU'RE READY
TO CATCH ME.

39:26.267 --> 39:28.167
***

39:28.200 --> 39:30.433
AND WE MAY BE SURPRISED

39:30.467 --> 39:32.367
BY THE COMMITMENTS
WE'RE WILLING

39:32.400 --> 39:35.367
TO LET SLIP OUT OF OUR GRASP.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.267
***

39:38.300 --> 39:43.567
COMMITMENTS ARE COMPLICATED.

39:46.433 --> 39:48.333
***

39:48.367 --> 39:51.233
I'M HERE FOR YOU,
WHATEVER IT IS.

39:53.267 --> 39:56.067
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY,
I'M HERE.

39:56.100 --> 39:59.300
THANK YOU.

39:59.333 --> 40:03.033
***

40:03.067 --> 40:05.767
WE MAY SURPRISE OURSELVES

40:05.800 --> 40:10.633
BY THE COMMITMENTS
WE'RE WILLING TO MAKE.

40:10.667 --> 40:13.667
***

40:17.533 --> 40:20.367
***

40:20.400 --> 40:25.400
AND SACRIFICE.

40:26.600 --> 40:29.600
***

40:34.833 --> 40:39.533
WHICH IS WHY SOMETIMES...

40:39.567 --> 40:42.433
WE HAVE TO LEARN THE HARD WAY

40:42.467 --> 40:47.533
TO CHOOSE OUR COMMITMENTS
VERY CAREFULLY.
