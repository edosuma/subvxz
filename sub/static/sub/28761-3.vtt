WEBVTT

00:22.439 --> 00:23.565
[grunting]

00:52.427 --> 00:55.138
-[Tom] The polls are tightening.
-Don't ride the poller coaster.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.557
That way madness lies.
The only poll that matters--

00:57.640 --> 00:58.683
-November fifth.
-Yep.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.643
Would you be saying that
if we were leading?

01:00.727 --> 01:03.396
Ask me when we're leading.
How is your convention speech coming?

01:03.480 --> 01:05.523
It's getting there. Anything else?

01:05.607 --> 01:09.152
Yes. I wanna make an issue of Moss' age.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.780
-Not a chance. Not going there.
-That he is out of touch.

01:11.863 --> 01:14.282
He's looking backward, not forward.
Old versus new.

01:14.365 --> 01:17.118
His ideas, not that he gets
to pay less to go to the movies.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.996
Implied contrast spots, then,
with you doing vigorous things.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.415
-Like, you know, sports.
-I play hockey.

01:22.499 --> 01:23.625
American sports.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.711
[Tom] Hey, honey.

01:26.795 --> 01:30.215
Hi. I'm gonna be late for school.
I will snack there. See you later.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.760
[sighs] It's like that now.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.262
What am I in for
when she turns into a teenager?

01:36.346 --> 01:38.598
You wanna hear, "It'll be fine,"
or you want the truth?

01:40.350 --> 01:41.643
It'll be fine.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.272
What do you expect to find
that we didn't see yesterday?

01:46.356 --> 01:47.357
Which was nothing.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.109
I'm an investigator. I investigate.

01:50.193 --> 01:53.363
Is this boring for you?
'Cause there's a nice empty car outside.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.783
[Eli] Investigator? The "I" in "CIA"
stands for "intelligence."

01:56.866 --> 01:59.285
-I used to be FBI.
-"Used to"?

02:00.203 --> 02:03.456
[sighs] Yeah, well,
I move fast and break things.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.972
This wasn't here yesterday,
all these dots.

02:49.878 --> 02:53.756
-What is that?
-Don't... touch anything.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.427
[theme music playing]

03:05.268 --> 03:07.061
[indistinct chatter]

03:18.072 --> 03:19.073
Your files.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.451
Hi.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.120
I have a meeting with people
who have important things to get to.

03:24.203 --> 03:25.538
As I mentioned last night,

03:25.622 --> 03:29.542
you're being considered for
the vice-presidential spot on the ticket.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.421
Well, let me cut this short.
While honored, I like my current position.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.089
The one with the very important people?

03:35.173 --> 03:38.509
Right. And I'm from Texas,
which Moss will carry as a native son,

03:38.593 --> 03:40.845
so I'd be of no help to the ticket,
geographically.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.972
Geographic balance is a relic concept.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.976
[scoffs] Okay.
Look, I've never run for office.

03:47.060 --> 03:47.894
I don't have the appetite to.

03:47.977 --> 03:51.147
Frankly, I'm not sure
I'd be particularly good at it.

03:51.773 --> 03:55.818
And yet you waited,
despite my rude tardiness.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.863
So you must be
at least somewhat intrigued.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.824
Hey, your surname,
did you have an Anglo father?

04:03.159 --> 04:05.119
No, that was changed.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.580
Would you mind changing it back?

04:08.498 --> 04:12.627
Okay. Well, if this is about exploiting
my Latino background,

04:12.710 --> 04:15.004
-I'll most certainly pass.
-Oh, come on, Aaron.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.341
Don't be so touchy.
You're an excellent fit.

04:18.424 --> 04:21.427
You bolster Kirkman's
foreign policy bona fides,

04:21.511 --> 04:26.266
you're experienced, you're admired
and, yeah, sue me, you're Latino.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.477
Latinos, millennials, urban blacks,

04:29.560 --> 04:33.731
they were all a huge chunk
of the 45% of eligible voters

04:33.815 --> 04:37.944
who stayed home last time,
whining about having no real choice.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.905
What I'm trying to explain to them,
and to all of America,

04:40.989 --> 04:47.620
is that the president, and hopefully you,
are a new and amazing choice.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.250
Let me think about it.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.003
Try thinking about anything else.

04:55.586 --> 04:56.504
Sir?

04:56.587 --> 04:59.424
I've been working on platform thoughts
for the reelect,

04:59.507 --> 05:02.010
but I am president now
and I need to govern.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.596
I know Congress isn't gonna take up our
agenda in the waning months of my term,

05:05.680 --> 05:07.390
but isn't there something we can do?

05:07.473 --> 05:08.516
What's in your platform?

05:08.599 --> 05:12.145
Real tax reform, common sense immigration,
health care for all.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.231
I got a memo from someone at NIH

05:15.315 --> 05:18.901
about the potential way to lower pricing
on certain drugs.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.945
That's good. Let's get someone on that.

05:21.946 --> 05:22.822
Uh...

05:23.489 --> 05:28.286
On the subject of drugs...
Lynn has relapsed.

05:29.787 --> 05:32.373
-She's back in rehab.
-I am so sorry.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.374
[softly] Yeah.

05:34.167 --> 05:38.379
-How are you doing?
-I'm all right. Thanks for asking.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.341
-Do you need to take some time?
-Not necessary.

05:43.092 --> 05:48.181
I just don't want this to become an issue
for the administration or campaign.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.640
It's a private matter.

05:50.349 --> 05:52.518
Does that even exist anymore?

05:53.936 --> 05:57.065
-We won't let it become an issue.
-Thank you, sir.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.741
Okay, we've gotta do something
very important and extremely stupid.

06:06.824 --> 06:07.784
Pick our color.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.953
For the electoral map.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.289
Republicans are red. Democrats are blue.
What are we gonna be?

06:13.372 --> 06:16.751
-Easy. Third color of the flag, white.
-We really wanna be the white party?

06:16.834 --> 06:20.213
-Black, then.
-Connoting foreboding and malevolence. No.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.799
There's already a Green Party.
Gray is ambivalent.

06:22.882 --> 06:26.511
-Yellow?
-The color of cowardice and urine. No.

06:26.594 --> 06:29.472
Purple.
Already used to symbolize neither party.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.015
To what do we owe the honor?

06:31.682 --> 06:32.850
Reporting for duty.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.269
Can we talk in my office?

06:36.104 --> 06:38.356
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

06:38.439 --> 06:41.400
The president assured me
that I would have exclusive prerogative

06:41.484 --> 06:42.485
over hiring and firing.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.530
-Well, if you'd like to call him...
-He doesn't trust me.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.324
Not the case.
I don't trust you, and he trusts me.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.493
Okay, so you're here as what, exactly?
Keeper of the flame?

06:50.576 --> 06:52.328
I'm here to help in any way that I can.

06:52.411 --> 06:53.246
[sighs]

06:53.830 --> 06:56.958
Okay, fine.
You're the new campaign spokesperson.

06:57.041 --> 07:00.837
Your first duty, go demote the old one.
You'll like his office.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.424
-[knocking on door]
-Nope! Go away!

07:07.051 --> 07:10.012
-I've got zip to do.
-All the action's on the campaign, man.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.098
I can't blame Emily for bolting.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.891
The next three months,
the only thing for us to do

07:13.975 --> 07:16.394
is defend the record
and prevent any gaffes.

07:16.477 --> 07:19.897
Hmm. It gives you time to connect with
this daughter you didn't know you had.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.232
How the fuck do you know about that?

07:21.941 --> 07:23.359
[chuckles] Privacy's a last century jam.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.695
I don't know that I have the right to call

07:25.778 --> 07:28.656
this 21-year-old product of my DNA
my daughter.

07:28.739 --> 07:31.409
-But you're gonna contact her?
-I don't know what I'd be getting into.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.621
I bet you're great at online stalking.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.332
-Don't even--
-All I want is the basics, okay?

07:38.416 --> 07:41.752
SAT score, voting record,
whether she's ever been wasted at a rave.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.171
I could be indicted for even hearing this.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.965
It's not like I'm asking the NSA
to draw up her file.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.633
You really need to find something to do.

07:49.051 --> 07:50.470
I think I just did.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.017
Smallpox?

07:56.100 --> 07:58.811
That was the shape of its viral structure,
marked on that wall.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.480
How? The whole place
was scrubbed with bleach.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.814
The researcher would've known

08:01.898 --> 08:03.524
scratching a bleached wall
with anything copper,

08:03.608 --> 08:05.234
like a penny minted before '82,

08:05.318 --> 08:07.612
eventually reveals a mark
for someone to find.

08:07.695 --> 08:10.406
The kinetics of the reaction were slow.
That's why it didn't show up until today.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.825
-Where are we going?
-Fort Detrick in Maryland.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.369
They keep one of the rare stores
of smallpox vaccine.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.580
We get it in time, we'll be fine.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.123
[tires screeching]

08:23.377 --> 08:25.421
Are you fucking kidding me?

08:27.465 --> 08:29.634
-You'll think about it?
-It's not a great job, anyway.

08:29.717 --> 08:32.845
Oh, right. Vice presidency's not worth
a bucket of warm spit.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.138
They cleaned that up. It's "piss."

08:34.222 --> 08:36.057
Garner actually said,
"Bucket of warm piss."

08:36.140 --> 08:37.558
Kirkman can only serve one more term.

08:37.642 --> 08:40.436
You'd be heir apparent next time,
win or lose.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.313
Let me make it simpler for you.

08:42.396 --> 08:44.941
Do you wanna be the first Latino president
of the United States?

08:45.024 --> 08:46.526
-Jesus Christ.
-Oh, my God. Of course.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.861
You don't want people thinking
you were chosen because you're Latino.

08:48.945 --> 08:52.031
-I know you think that's stupid--
-"Stupid" is the nicest word I'd use.

08:54.116 --> 08:57.537
Yes, come in. You expressed an interest
in pharmaceuticals.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.249
Yes, for parasitic worm disease
in sub-Saharan Africa.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.627
Praziquantel for schistosomiasis
costs 21 cents a pill,

09:04.710 --> 09:08.506
but helminths can be fought
with albendazole, costing three cents.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.049
That's what you wanna do.

09:10.132 --> 09:14.053
What I want is for you to get this woman
from the National Institutes of Health in

09:14.136 --> 09:16.347
and learn about march-in rights.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.140
Now would be good.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.562
What's up?

09:23.271 --> 09:25.022
[narrator] <i>President Kirkman</i>
<i>has never mentioned</i>

09:25.106 --> 09:27.108
<i>his transgender sister-in-law.</i>

09:27.191 --> 09:28.818
<i>What exactly is he hiding?</i>

09:28.901 --> 09:31.153
<i>Paid for by Citizens For Family.</i>

09:31.237 --> 09:32.113
Moss?

09:32.196 --> 09:34.240
Super PAC, run by a guy
who used to work for him.

09:34.323 --> 09:37.535
-What do you wanna do, sir?
-Respect Sasha's privacy and ignore it.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.038
-That's not gonna be possible.
-[Seth] This has already gone viral.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.417
All the major networks are gonna cover it.
It's a free media firestorm.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.044
Not only gonna get whacked
by the social conservatives,

09:47.128 --> 09:50.423
but the LGBTQ activists are gonna hit you
for willful neglect.

09:50.506 --> 09:53.134
So, on one hand, I will be accused
of having a secret agenda,

09:53.217 --> 09:54.885
and on the other,
ducking the subject completely.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.846
All because I don't wanna
drag my sister-in-law

09:56.929 --> 09:58.222
through this political maelstrom.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.726
-I'd avoid the word "drag."
-Okay, we're done talking about this.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.479
-I need you to check in with the campaign.
-Yep.

10:08.357 --> 10:09.317
[telephone ringing]

10:09.400 --> 10:10.985
-[Emily] Emily Rhodes.
-[Seth] <i>Emily?</i>

10:11.611 --> 10:14.488
-[Emily chuckles] Ta-da.
<i>-Oh. Congratulations?</i>

10:14.572 --> 10:17.491
Yeah, we'll see. When we have a second,
I'm gonna need some pointers.

10:17.575 --> 10:21.037
Here are the two basic ones.
Don't lie and don't get into an argument.

10:21.120 --> 10:25.124
Okay, well, I assume you're calling about
the sister-in-law spot. Fucking Moss.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.335
He's an unprincipled, ego-drunk choad.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.587
Yeah, well,
he and the president were friends.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.465
<i>-I never trusted him.</i>
-Okay, great. Then you win.

10:32.548 --> 10:35.551
Naivete is among your elemental charms.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.637
<i>Did you know about Sasha?</i>

10:37.720 --> 10:39.263
Yeah, she and the First Lady
were pretty close.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.349
It was really hard on Alex
when she moved to Paris.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.185
But, you know,
she never wanted to be in the spotlight.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.187
Well, sadly, that's all over now.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.105
That's what I'm on my way
to talk to the president about now.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.566
I'll catch you later. Okay.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.694
[knocking on door]

10:53.778 --> 10:56.572
-[Isabel] Hi.
-Hi. I'm Kasey from the NIH.

10:57.406 --> 10:58.532
Isabel.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.994
[coughs] It's okay,
I don't have meningitis.

11:02.078 --> 11:05.081
Jury's still out on lupus,
but that's not contagious, so...

11:06.874 --> 11:10.336
You're here to educate me
on march-in rights.

11:10.419 --> 11:14.799
Okay. So, a significant portion
of drug research and development

11:14.882 --> 11:19.845
is actually funded by federal grants
to university labs and foundations.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.681
The Bayh-Dole Act
allows pharmaceutical companies

11:22.765 --> 11:26.811
to then purchase patents
on any marketable medications that result.

11:26.894 --> 11:30.481
And charge whatever they like for them,
usually exorbitantly.

11:30.564 --> 11:34.193
With their usual justification
of R&D costs. Complete bullshit.

11:34.276 --> 11:37.113
Yeah. However, tucked away in Bayh-Dole

11:37.196 --> 11:40.074
is a provision allowing
the federal government to march in

11:40.157 --> 11:43.327
and take away patents for drugs
developed using federal dollars

11:43.411 --> 11:46.247
that aren't reaching an adequate portion
of the patients who need them.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.958
Because they cost too fucking much.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.877
[grunts] Are we allowed
to swear like that?

11:52.420 --> 11:54.255
The FBI's not gonna burst
through the door.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.464
[chuckles]

11:55.548 --> 12:00.886
So you're saying that the president
possesses previously legislated authority

12:00.970 --> 12:02.930
to force certain drug prices down?

12:03.013 --> 12:03.931
Yes.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.558
Fuckin' A.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.436
She's received death threats.
Death threats!

12:08.519 --> 12:10.396
That harassment isn't gonna stop
until you make it.

12:10.479 --> 12:13.190
A statement alone is not gonna do it.
You have to bring her here.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.651
Normalize her
to neutralize this as a talking point.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.945
She doesn't deserve any of this.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.658
Fine. You're right. I'll invite her.

12:22.741 --> 12:26.120
Moss is gonna keep this up
until we bloody his nose.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.707
I wanna leak
that he's carrying the Alzheimer's gene.

12:29.790 --> 12:30.749
Oh, my God.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.627
-We can't make up something like that.
-Not making it up.

12:33.711 --> 12:37.673
You know the AIPAC event
that all three campaigns did last week?

12:37.756 --> 12:41.385
Our team came in to set up
while they were clearing away after Moss,

12:41.469 --> 12:42.928
-and I swiped his spoon.
-[Emily] I don't believe this.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.599
I had it tested for DNA.
I think the result speaks for itself.

12:46.682 --> 12:47.641
That's gene theft.

12:47.725 --> 12:50.603
Illegal in only eight states,
none of them being Virginia.

12:50.686 --> 12:54.064
And unethical in all 50,
and a complete violation of his privacy.

12:54.148 --> 12:57.568
Sort of like what they did to Sasha,
only this is actually relevant.

12:57.651 --> 12:58.486
Oh, come on.

12:58.569 --> 13:01.280
A 70-year-old man
running for a four-year term,

13:01.363 --> 13:04.909
with a 12 times greater-than-normal
risk of cognitive decline.

13:04.992 --> 13:08.245
You think the American people
really want an Alzheimer's-addled Moss

13:08.329 --> 13:10.664
answering the 3:00 a.m. crisis call?

13:10.748 --> 13:12.708
This is absolutely fair game.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.002
And what's next?
A break-in at his cardiologist's?

13:15.085 --> 13:17.379
The American people
have the right to know.

13:18.797 --> 13:21.926
And Moss has a right not to,
if that's his choice.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.928
We are certainly not
going to be the people

13:24.011 --> 13:26.096
to make such a personal decision for him.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.098
I wouldn't want anyone making it for me.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.059
I forbid this. That's final. Thank you.

13:32.019 --> 13:35.231
Mr. Harper, Penny's school's calling
for the president.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.316
-Can he be interrupted?
-[Mars] What's it about?

13:37.399 --> 13:39.109
May I ask what this is concerning?

13:40.819 --> 13:42.154
[clears throat]

13:43.155 --> 13:44.657
This is Chief of Staff Harper.

13:47.826 --> 13:51.830
I see. Thank you for informing us.
I'll let the president know.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.625
Good day not to be you.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.420
That's most days, but, uh, yeah.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.757
What now?

14:04.343 --> 14:06.720
-Penny's school called.
-Is she all right?

14:06.804 --> 14:08.597
Nothing alarming. At least, I wouldn't...

14:08.681 --> 14:11.934
Not that I'd...
I mean, it's part of... You know...

14:12.017 --> 14:13.185
Not so far.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.063
It's a bit awkward.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.774
I would say the awkwardness
is verging on profound.

14:22.152 --> 14:26.448
Penny got her period. So... that.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.285
Hmm.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.915
Two middle-aged men talking about
one of their daughter's first period.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.626
What could be awkward about that?

14:39.587 --> 14:41.672
-I'm not sure what I--
-I think you just leave.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.979
She's growing up, honey.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.108
She's growing up.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.236
[Hannah] Yeah, Dianne, we're fine.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.949
As transmissible as smallpox is,
the vaccine is completely effective

15:09.033 --> 15:11.535
if taken within
the 12-day incubation period

15:11.619 --> 15:14.788
that someone nicer would've
told me about sooner, but he didn't.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.709
Yeah. She wants to know how this guy
got his hands on smallpox.

15:18.792 --> 15:22.004
He didn't. He ordered separate pieces
of DNA and put it together.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.882
Which is supposed to be
closely monitored and isn't. Ergo...

15:25.507 --> 15:26.508
Did you get that?

15:27.343 --> 15:32.514
Dr. Mays believes the researcher isolated
the contagion section of smallpox DNA,

15:32.598 --> 15:35.517
and then via CRISPR,
he inserted it into the bird flu virus,

15:35.601 --> 15:39.521
which accounts for its sudden
greater communicability.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.650
Tell her we're going to Toronto.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.528
There's been an outbreak
at an OB-GYN clinic in Toronto.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.822
We're gonna head... Yes, Dianne.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.785
Yeah, I got it. Okay. Goodbye.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.954
What was that?

15:55.037 --> 15:59.667
She's just reminding me I'm CIA now,
whose stock-in-trade is stealth.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.878
So she would prefer
that I go about my business

16:02.962 --> 16:07.508
without attracting
the attention of the local constabulary.

16:08.842 --> 16:09.677
[clamoring]

16:09.760 --> 16:11.220
-[Seth] Philip!
-[Philip] Thank you, Seth.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.973
Why has the president not mentioned
his sister-in-law before?

16:14.056 --> 16:16.767
Not mentioning something is not
the same thing as not mentioning it.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.477
If that's not too Zen koan.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.895
-Seth!
-[Seth] Yes, Dennis.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.772
Was President Kirkman
trying to conceal it?

16:21.855 --> 16:24.358
"It" is a human being with a name,
which is private.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.610
The president's intent being
to respect said privacy,

16:26.694 --> 16:28.278
not to try to conceal anything. Yeah.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.656
Seth, what's the president's position
on transgender rights?

16:30.739 --> 16:32.116
The president supports all human rights.

16:32.199 --> 16:35.119
Seth! Is the president's position
on transgender rights

16:35.202 --> 16:36.704
influenced by his sister-in-law?

16:36.787 --> 16:38.497
It was just asked
what that position even was.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.999
Obviously, a position you can't identify

16:40.082 --> 16:43.502
can't magically be brought into being
just because of a family relation.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.381
That made sense in my head
before I said it.

16:47.464 --> 16:49.091
-[reporters clamoring]
-Gary Lee.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.521
<i>-Oui, allô.</i>
-[Tom] <i>Sasha. It's me, Tom.</i>

17:03.522 --> 17:04.982
Hello, Mr. President.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.401
I am so sorry for everything
that you're dealing with.

17:07.484 --> 17:10.529
Well, the suddenness along with
the almost surreal invasiveness,

17:10.612 --> 17:12.448
it has been a bit disorienting.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.741
It's appalling.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.910
It didn't occur to me that running
for a second term would bring this on.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.621
-[Sasha]<i> And so it has.</i>
-Right.

17:20.789 --> 17:23.500
Well, now I find myself
in the awkward position

17:23.584 --> 17:26.336
<i>of having to ask you if you'd be</i>
<i>willing to come to Washington, DC.</i>

17:26.420 --> 17:28.297
To help you politically?

17:28.380 --> 17:29.798
<i>No, to help us both. </i>

17:30.382 --> 17:33.886
I'm told that the only way to stop
this intrusion into your private life

17:33.969 --> 17:36.513
<i>is for us to stand together,</i>
<i>a public appearance.</i>

17:36.597 --> 17:41.143
I need to relinquish my privacy
in order to restore it?

17:41.226 --> 17:46.023
[sighs] I'm afraid so.
Obviously, the choice is yours.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.236
I'll catch the first flight out
in the morning.

17:51.320 --> 17:55.365
Okay. Thank you, Sasha. I'll see you soon.

17:55.949 --> 17:56.950
Good night, Tom.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.543
So I just wanted to let you
and everyone at the <i>Post</i> know

18:06.627 --> 18:09.588
that all campaign-related questions
should now be directed my way.

18:09.671 --> 18:13.175
And as for trading leaks
for favorable coverage,

18:13.258 --> 18:15.010
heaven forfend.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.595
Bye, Howard.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.600
-What's up? You miss me already?
-Oh. Envious.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.728
But I decided that, as always,

18:24.812 --> 18:27.523
jealousy is stupid,
when I could just join you.

18:28.816 --> 18:32.694
-I can't poach you from Seth.
-That's a little plantationy, no?

18:33.695 --> 18:36.657
Well, he's a friend,
and he raves about you.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.576
-[Lorraine] What? What?
-What?

18:39.660 --> 18:43.372
The FCC just ruled that our convention
is not a convention, it's a rally,

18:43.455 --> 18:46.500
and thus not entitled to free air time
on the networks.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.669
We would have to pay
for four days of coverage,

18:48.752 --> 18:50.629
which we cannot afford to do.

18:50.712 --> 18:53.132
Take a wild guess
who first appointed the commissioner

18:53.215 --> 18:55.259
-who cast the swing vote.
-Moss.

18:55.342 --> 18:59.596
Are you starting to understand what kind
of a dick we're dealing with, Pollyanna?

19:01.473 --> 19:05.602
Stage it someplace cool and free.
And put it on the Web.

19:05.686 --> 19:09.148
-You're the White House digital guy.
-I guess.

19:09.231 --> 19:12.985
So an unconvention? That could work.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.865
You work here now, for her. Set it up.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.661
-Sir.
-[Tom] Aaron, please.

19:22.744 --> 19:25.914
I intended to get to this earlier,
but it's been a day.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.457
Well, aren't they all?

19:27.541 --> 19:30.586
It's a wonder anybody even wants this job,
let alone chases after it

19:30.669 --> 19:33.005
as hard as I'm learning you have to,
to get it.

19:33.672 --> 19:37.009
Anyway, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.470
Something rather momentous.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.097
Sir.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.099
Syria.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.393
[stutters] Sir?

19:46.476 --> 19:50.981
I want you to quietly, secretly reach out
to the parties involved in the conflict,

19:51.064 --> 19:54.610
with an eye not just towards
a cessation of hostilities,

19:54.693 --> 19:57.446
but a realistic, workable peace plan.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.449
Syria is quickly becoming
a potential tinderbox for World War III,

20:00.532 --> 20:04.620
and we have to do absolutely everything
we can to solve this before it's too late.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.455
It will be an honor to try.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.795
-Was there anything else?
-[chuckles] No. Isn't that enough?

20:14.755 --> 20:17.216
-Right. Thank you, Mr. President.
-Come on.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.095
[sniffles]

20:26.308 --> 20:30.229
-Sorry to be late.
-That was for you. I'm used to it.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.357
Quite all right.
Please, sit down, Mr. Harper.

20:35.275 --> 20:39.988
Okay, well,
the purpose of today's session is to--

20:40.072 --> 20:41.448
Our second go-around.

20:42.115 --> 20:45.619
You wanna know what in our relationship
might help account for my being here.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.413
-Is that what you want to discuss today?
-Let her--

20:48.497 --> 20:50.207
He's a wonderful partner.

20:50.290 --> 20:55.837
He's attentive and irreproachable
and unimpeachably correct.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.756
She doesn't mean that as a compliment.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.884
I noticed that you didn't say loving.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.805
It's not applicable.

21:05.389 --> 21:08.642
-That's unfair.
-Our marriage was transactional.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.310
There's no shame in it.

21:10.394 --> 21:13.021
There's just no sense
in pretending otherwise.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.189
Transactional in what way?

21:14.273 --> 21:18.277
She means I'm the poor-boy grocer's son
who married into her money.

21:19.820 --> 21:23.865
Money was incidental.
He married me for my father.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.201
And your father
was a prominent politician?

21:27.828 --> 21:29.705
He was the "Lion of the Senate."

21:31.707 --> 21:34.334
Just the ticket
for an ambitious young climber

21:34.418 --> 21:37.504
with a degree in political science
from a mediocre university.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.009
Earlier, you said that your husband
was irreproachable.

21:46.972 --> 21:52.019
Do you know he's never smoked pot?
Or whatever they call it these days.

21:52.894 --> 21:56.106
It took me the longest time
to decide if that was, uh...

21:57.316 --> 22:00.694
discipline, timidity,

22:00.777 --> 22:04.489
or just the avoidance
of a biographical detail

22:04.573 --> 22:07.284
that might jeopardize
his professional ascent.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.703
And did you arrive at any conclusions?

22:11.580 --> 22:16.626
-[chuckles] It was an implied rebuke.
-In other words, this is all my fault.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.463
Not all.

22:24.676 --> 22:25.927
But not none.

22:30.640 --> 22:34.061
I'm there waiting for him
to bring up the VP slot.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.646
And it hit me, "Idiot!"
I told her I'd think about it.

22:36.730 --> 22:37.981
So have you?

22:38.065 --> 22:41.318
[Aaron] Well, it is the second
most powerful position in the free world.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.945
Oh. This morning it was
"a bucket of warm piss."

22:44.029 --> 22:47.115
Well, my views on the subject
are evolving.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.116
On the office, or wanting it?

22:48.200 --> 22:51.620
You said it would instantly make me
a plausible presidential contender.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.996
It's something I've never dreamt of.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.082
An opportunity
that might never come again.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.124
But?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.502
You and Lorraine
and, for all I know, the president,

22:58.585 --> 23:00.462
want me to be the Great Latino Hope.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.505
Which you're not okay with.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.131
I've been looking
to avoid that all my life.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.718
-And I know you don't agree with that--
-It's not for me to agree or disagree.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.012
Just stop, okay?
Just tell me what you think.

23:09.096 --> 23:13.058
I think you're a grown-ass man
and that your identity,

23:13.141 --> 23:15.977
and your relationship to it,
is something you worked out for yourself

23:16.061 --> 23:18.522
a long time ago and will survive

23:18.605 --> 23:21.650
whatever external objectification you
might be in for in a national campaign.

23:21.733 --> 23:24.861
-Yeah, "might be"?
-Will be. My point stands.

23:27.114 --> 23:30.534
-[sighs] All right.
-Holy shit, is this really happening?

23:31.076 --> 23:35.122
[clears throat] Lorraine.
Hey, sorry to bother you so late. I...

23:35.997 --> 23:39.042
I guess it's your voice mail,
so this is not really, uh...

23:39.126 --> 23:41.503
Look, I just wanted to touch base...

23:41.586 --> 23:44.464
[stuttering] Yeah,
not touch base so much as...

23:44.548 --> 23:45.674
Oh, my God.

23:45.757 --> 23:49.177
Look, I wanted to call you
to tell you... Shit.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.888
Smooth. Really, I wouldn't change a word.

23:54.057 --> 23:56.268
What? You gotta be shitting...
Her mailbox is full.

23:56.351 --> 23:58.270
-Well, text her.
-I'm not gonna text her.

23:58.353 --> 24:00.522
You don't accept a VP nod
via text message.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.566
E-mail, then. Whatever, baby.
Just get it done.

24:02.649 --> 24:04.276
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me--

24:04.359 --> 24:05.694
[cell phone ringing]

24:09.489 --> 24:10.490
Lorraine.

24:11.992 --> 24:15.162
Okay, this is doable. Yeah?

24:15.745 --> 24:18.165
An unconvention
for the accidental president.

24:18.248 --> 24:21.501
-It's not just doable, it's almost cool.
-Almost.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.003
It's still politics.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.715
-Hey, do you think I'm naive?
-That Pollyanna crack?

24:27.382 --> 24:28.425
Consider the source.

24:28.508 --> 24:31.011
Lorraine is a pro,
and that wasn't really an answer.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.599
-You have principles.
-Mmm. So in other words, yes.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.268
Having principles doesn't make you naive.

24:38.351 --> 24:41.104
[sighs] I probably need to
toughen up a little.

24:45.275 --> 24:48.612
<i>He thought he could keep it</i>
<i>hidden away, lurking. </i>

24:48.695 --> 24:51.865
<i>And then spring it</i>
<i>on an unsuspecting American public,</i>

24:51.948 --> 24:56.328
<i>a radical, alt-gender,</i>
<i>alt-sexuality agenda.</i>

24:56.411 --> 24:59.414
<i>It's such an out-of-sight-out-of-mind,</i>
<i>back-in-the-closet marginalization. </i>

24:59.497 --> 25:02.000
<i>Pretend she doesn't exist</i>
<i>and wish it into oblivion.</i>

25:03.627 --> 25:06.630
The right gets angry,
and the left gets sad.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.924
We need to seize the news cycle back.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.468
We're gonna do this unconvention thing,
but move it up.

25:11.551 --> 25:12.802
-[Lorraine] To?
-Tomorrow night.

25:12.886 --> 25:13.970
That's impossible.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.263
Sasha lands today.

25:15.347 --> 25:18.266
We do a photo op, then we change the story
right back to what we're running on.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.392
That should work.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.770
If it were workable.
There are logistics involved.

25:21.853 --> 25:24.022
Like what? All we need are cameras
and an Internet connection.

25:24.105 --> 25:26.107
I can't pull together a crowd
that quickly.

25:26.191 --> 25:29.986
We don't need one. That's the point.
I talk directly to the voter, personally.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.656
-Well, what about your speech?
-Pull an all-nighter.

25:34.032 --> 25:37.661
Uh, the story just broke
about Moss carrying the Alzheimer's gene.

25:37.744 --> 25:38.578
What?

25:39.371 --> 25:42.832
-Did I not make myself perfectly clear?
-I didn't do this.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.751
You got 30 seconds
to make me believe that.

25:44.834 --> 25:47.921
Hey, I know that you and, you know,
Jiminy Cricket here

25:48.004 --> 25:51.591
think that I would do anything to win,
and, okay, you're right, I would,

25:51.675 --> 25:56.012
right up to ignoring explicit, unambiguous
instructions from my candidate,

25:56.096 --> 25:59.015
which I have never done
and would never do.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.518
Because you do it once,
you can kiss your career goodbye.

26:01.601 --> 26:04.604
This wasn't me.
Polygraph me on a stack of Bibles,

26:04.688 --> 26:06.856
holding a gun to my dog's
and my mother's head.

26:08.191 --> 26:09.609
Someone at the lab, maybe?

26:09.693 --> 26:11.444
We'll deal with it later,
but we are definitely doing this.

26:11.528 --> 26:14.197
We are gonna steal the news cycle
back from this shit.

26:22.163 --> 26:26.626
-The flu hit roughly three weeks ago.
-Isolated to this clinic?

26:26.710 --> 26:28.336
[Eli] Mortality rate, Dr. Mouray?

26:28.420 --> 26:33.049
Zero. People got pretty intense symptoms.
I caught it, and it kicked my butt.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.176
[Hannah] That's scary, in your condition.

26:35.760 --> 26:39.055
A bit. But two weeks later,
I was completely fine.

26:39.597 --> 26:40.682
Everyone was.

26:40.765 --> 26:43.351
I'm sorry there's nothing
more dramatic to report.

26:43.435 --> 26:47.814
Well, not sorry, obviously.
But you may have come up here for nothing.

26:47.897 --> 26:50.442
Have you identified a patient zero
for the outbreak?

26:50.525 --> 26:51.359
Not really.

26:51.443 --> 26:54.112
Anything unusual or different here
around that time?

26:54.195 --> 26:55.196
No.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.283
We did hire this new nurse.

26:58.825 --> 27:02.912
-I'll need to speak to him or her.
-Mmm-hmm. A guy. But he quit.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.665
Then I'll need
his contact information, please.

27:06.249 --> 27:08.543
And we have clear statutory authority

27:08.626 --> 27:10.378
to strong-arm
these drug companies on this?

27:10.462 --> 27:12.881
I checked with Counsel's office.
They signed off.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.007
But my only question is,

27:14.090 --> 27:16.009
this law has been on the books
for decades.

27:16.092 --> 27:18.178
-Why has no administration tried this?
-You know why.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.473
President's willing to tick off Big Pharma
in an election year?

27:21.556 --> 27:24.392
-He wants to govern.
-Plus, he can run on this.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.103
We need to find the exact right test case.

27:27.187 --> 27:30.857
A medication way too expensive
for something common and serious.

27:30.940 --> 27:34.235
Preferably where people have died.
I am going to hell.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.071
Heaven, anyone asks me.

27:36.738 --> 27:37.614
Insulin.

27:37.697 --> 27:41.618
Helmdale Pharmaceuticals has raised
their price eight-fold in the last decade,

27:41.701 --> 27:46.039
leading some diabetics
to ration their dosage with fatal results.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.749
Get the CEO in here.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.417
I will coordinate with your office
on a time.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.045
This is your project.
You bring this guy in.

27:52.837 --> 27:53.838
Yes, sir.

27:56.966 --> 27:57.967
[Tom] Oolong.

27:58.676 --> 28:01.304
-[Sasha] You remembered.
-Of course.

28:04.140 --> 28:06.518
So, tell me, how is Penny?

28:08.019 --> 28:11.064
Evidently she had
her first period yesterday.

28:11.981 --> 28:13.149
"Evidently"?

28:13.233 --> 28:16.027
The school didn't have her mother
to call anymore, so...

28:16.111 --> 28:19.114
So they called her father, the president.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.241
Worse, they left a message.

28:22.117 --> 28:25.703
Oh, how awful. Have you spoken to her?

28:25.787 --> 28:28.081
Not yet.
She stayed at a friend's house last night.

28:28.164 --> 28:29.499
Poor thing.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.378
I'd be happy to speak with her,
if you like.

28:34.295 --> 28:35.964
I don't know. I can...

28:37.257 --> 28:41.344
It's okay. You're correct.
I didn't actually go through it myself.

28:41.428 --> 28:44.305
It only felt like I did.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.100
But that's the whole point.

28:48.518 --> 28:50.395
But don't you think
that she'd be more comfortable

28:50.478 --> 28:54.190
discussing it with someone
who looks like me rather than like you?

28:54.816 --> 28:57.819
-Maybe you're right. Thank you.
-Yeah.

29:00.405 --> 29:03.533
I made a decision on the flight here

29:04.159 --> 29:07.537
that I not be employed as simply a prop.

29:07.620 --> 29:10.582
-Sasha, when I asked you to come--
-No, Tom, let me finish.

29:12.375 --> 29:15.044
Now that the things are as they are,

29:16.087 --> 29:19.299
there's no reason for me
to continue to absent myself

29:19.382 --> 29:23.553
from this place,
from a young girl who's lost her mother.

29:24.512 --> 29:26.389
So, unless you object,

29:26.473 --> 29:29.851
after we do the photo op
and wave from the balcony,

29:30.602 --> 29:33.730
I'd like to remain on, for her...

29:35.148 --> 29:37.150
and for Alex.

29:38.902 --> 29:41.112
Thank you. Penny would love that.

29:43.114 --> 29:44.115
And you?

29:44.699 --> 29:45.700
Of course.

29:47.660 --> 29:51.247
You know,
you never asked me any questions.

29:51.331 --> 29:53.374
Like, about my transition.

29:53.458 --> 29:57.295
I mean, everyone has questions.
You must have had some.

29:57.378 --> 29:59.756
I wanted to respect your privacy.

30:01.341 --> 30:07.680
So, tell me,
how do you feel, personally, about me?

30:08.389 --> 30:09.974
Completely accepting.

30:11.351 --> 30:14.813
Intellectually, sure.
But what about viscerally?

30:14.896 --> 30:18.566
I mean,
have you fully accepted it viscerally?

30:19.108 --> 30:21.277
Be truthful. Please.

30:22.737 --> 30:23.863
Honestly...

30:27.367 --> 30:29.410
I'd have to say that, viscerally...

30:32.163 --> 30:34.415
I'm still a work-in-progress.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.295
Aren't we all?

30:40.380 --> 30:42.257
I'm not sure why this is necessary.

30:42.340 --> 30:45.426
I've been extensively vetted
many times over for my previous positions.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.262
This is different, a political vetting.

30:47.345 --> 30:50.390
You'll be asked about more personal
information than for your previous posts.

30:50.473 --> 30:52.809
-Shall we begin?
-Yes, by all means.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.353
You've had an extensive bachelorhood.

30:55.436 --> 30:58.523
Has it resulted
in any sexually transmitted diseases?

30:58.606 --> 31:01.734
[laughs] Okay.
Talk about starting off with a bang.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.781
-No.
-No herpes?

31:06.865 --> 31:08.366
-HIV?
-No means no.

31:09.742 --> 31:12.078
Have you had sexual relations
with underage girls?

31:12.912 --> 31:13.746
Absolutely not.

31:13.830 --> 31:14.956
-Underage boys?
-No.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.416
-[Gwen] Men?
-No.

31:16.499 --> 31:18.835
Have you had sexual relations
with married women?

31:19.669 --> 31:22.380
Technically, yes.
She was separated at the time.

31:22.463 --> 31:24.173
We'll need her name
and contact information.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.259
-Why would that be necessary?
-For confirmation.

31:26.342 --> 31:27.927
But I already explained the circumstances.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.470
Then why object
to obtaining corroboration?

31:29.554 --> 31:31.681
'Cause she's not the one
being considered for office, I am.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.725
She deserves having her privacy respected.

31:33.808 --> 31:37.186
Anyone you've had intimacies with,
gotten drunk, high, gambled

31:37.270 --> 31:40.231
or broken the speed limit with you
on land, sea or air

31:40.315 --> 31:41.774
is fair game in this inquiry.

31:43.359 --> 31:44.694
Privacy be damned.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.738
In a word, yes.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.911
[line ringing]

31:53.578 --> 31:54.412
Hello?

31:55.038 --> 31:59.626
Hi. This is Seth Wright. I'm your...
You contacted me?

32:00.960 --> 32:02.754
I wasn't sure you'd respond.

32:02.837 --> 32:07.216
No, no, of course.
I'm really glad you reached out.

32:07.300 --> 32:10.261
Are you?
I didn't want it to be weird for you.

32:10.345 --> 32:13.848
-No, no, no. Not at all.
-Well, probably a little.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.643
[Seth] <i>Maybe. But also,</i>
<i>you know, kind of...</i>

32:16.726 --> 32:19.938
[scoffs] I'm trying to find
a less lame word for "cool."

32:20.688 --> 32:23.566
[chuckles] "Cool" is fine.
I think so, too.

32:24.233 --> 32:26.653
So, uh, do you wanna meet?

32:26.736 --> 32:31.491
Maybe grab a... I guess a drink might be
a little weird, but not illegal.

32:32.283 --> 32:36.287
-Let's have that drink.
-Great. How's tomorrow evening?

32:36.371 --> 32:37.330
[Stephanie] <i>Tomorrow's good.</i>

32:37.413 --> 32:41.417
Great. I just said "great."
At least I've moved on from "cool."

32:41.501 --> 32:43.544
[both chuckle]

32:43.628 --> 32:47.548
-Uh... Okay, so tomorrow, then?
-Tomorrow.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.968
All right. I'll text you.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.761
-[Stephanie]<i> Bye.</i>
-Bye.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.605
I can feel you watching me.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.315
Sorry.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.819
[sighs] No, I'm not.

33:07.902 --> 33:10.071
This is the most important speech
of my career.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.489
Until the next one.

33:13.741 --> 33:16.369
-Take a walk, sir.
-Fine.

33:23.960 --> 33:27.213
-[Penny chuckling]
-[Sasha] This is true. This is true.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.383
[Penny] I know! It's the worst.

33:30.466 --> 33:32.093
[Sasha] No. No, no, no, no.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.637
Actually, I have it on good authority
from your mom,

33:34.721 --> 33:38.433
-childbirth is the worst.
-Oh, God. Don't tell me that.

33:38.516 --> 33:41.602
But Leo's, not yours.
Evidently you were a breeze.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.604
She said she could've squatted in a field

33:43.688 --> 33:45.898
-and you would've popped right out.
-That's disgusting.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.317
-[Sasha] No, it's beautiful.
-[Penny] That's so gross.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.361
It's kind of gross. It's kind of gross.

33:50.445 --> 33:51.821
[Penny chuckling]

33:53.573 --> 33:54.574
So?

33:56.451 --> 33:58.953
It hits all the points
you've talked about.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.205
But?

34:02.123 --> 34:04.375
They're all things
other candidates have said.

34:04.459 --> 34:07.545
What can you tell voters
that they haven't already heard?

34:07.628 --> 34:11.883
What have you been thinking about that
wasn't on some memo from the policy shop?

34:20.558 --> 34:21.726
I know what it is.

34:31.486 --> 34:36.157
Hey. There's no trace of this male nurse.
He just blew in from nowhere.

34:36.240 --> 34:39.660
He's got a fake name, false credentials,
bogus references,

34:39.744 --> 34:41.204
and then he just ghosted.

34:41.287 --> 34:43.873
He could be a candidate
for who infected them all.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.291
I examined the virus.

34:45.374 --> 34:47.710
Entirely different
than what killed the birds,

34:47.794 --> 34:50.505
and no smallpox-derived contagion piece.

34:50.588 --> 34:51.756
So it could be a natural outbreak?

34:51.839 --> 34:54.675
No. There was something
CRISPR'd into the virus.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.552
I just don't recognize what it is.

34:59.138 --> 35:02.433
There's something else.
Dr. Mouray's office called.

35:03.392 --> 35:06.020
-She miscarried.
-Oh, my God.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.815
As did several other pregnant patients
who also got sick.

35:08.898 --> 35:11.734
-Can a bad flu do that?
-Up to a point.

35:12.443 --> 35:16.072
But I ran the numbers. This is in excess
of what you'd expect to find.

35:17.490 --> 35:20.201
An induced miscarriage cluster

35:20.284 --> 35:23.454
camouflaged to mimic something
that might occur naturally.

35:23.538 --> 35:26.707
What connects miscarriages in Canada
to dead birds in Florida?

35:27.583 --> 35:28.584
Maybe nothing.

35:29.710 --> 35:30.711
Maybe not.

35:32.630 --> 35:33.506
[Aaron] Sir.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.843
One of the nice things
about being president,

35:37.718 --> 35:39.929
no one tells you
you look like shit in the morning.

35:40.012 --> 35:43.141
[chuckles] I'm gonna observe
that tradition. Trouble sleeping?

35:43.224 --> 35:46.644
Up late working on the speech for tonight,
which is why I asked you here.

35:46.727 --> 35:50.982
I would like to begin with an announcement
of my running mate,

35:51.065 --> 35:52.859
and I would like that to be you.

35:53.568 --> 35:54.610
[exhales sharply]

35:55.945 --> 35:57.530
I'm deeply honored.

35:57.613 --> 35:58.698
Well, before you say that,

35:58.781 --> 36:01.826
I'd be remiss if I didn't warn you
about what you were getting into.

36:01.909 --> 36:02.910
[sighs]

36:03.536 --> 36:05.371
Absolute loss of privacy.

36:05.454 --> 36:08.541
In fact, in no way, shape or form
would your life be your own.

36:09.417 --> 36:10.585
I understand.

36:10.668 --> 36:12.920
No, you don't.
That's what I'm trying to convey.

36:14.797 --> 36:19.594
Sir, if it's not impertinent,
there is something I do have to ask you.

36:19.677 --> 36:20.720
Shoot.

36:20.803 --> 36:23.306
I need to know you're not choosing me
because I'm Latino.

36:25.474 --> 36:26.934
I respect the question.

36:28.227 --> 36:32.023
And I hope you'll respect my answer.

36:33.983 --> 36:37.028
The easiest thing for me to say
is that I hired the right man for the job,

36:37.111 --> 36:41.073
and as much as I believe that,
the honest answer is, I don't know.

36:42.408 --> 36:45.494
I'm not immune to the arguments
of an electoral advantage.

36:46.829 --> 36:48.456
But I can tell you this, Aaron.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.959
If at any point the campaign
were to treat your heritage

36:52.043 --> 36:53.920
in a way that made you uncomfortable,

36:54.587 --> 36:57.632
come to me, and I would make
an immediate course correction.

37:00.134 --> 37:01.636
I appreciate that, sir.

37:02.511 --> 37:05.014
And it would be
my great privilege to accept.

37:18.986 --> 37:22.281
Mr. Ralsch. Isabel Pardo.
Thank you for coming.

37:22.823 --> 37:23.908
Please.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.537
-The reason we invited you to--
-Are we waiting for Mr. Harper?

37:29.413 --> 37:30.873
You'll just be meeting with me.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.254
[clears throat]

37:38.547 --> 37:41.092
We are here to discuss march-in rights

37:41.175 --> 37:45.012
as applies to your Keziax brand
of insulin.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.389
As undoubtedly you know,

37:46.472 --> 37:48.933
Bayh-Dole allows for intervention
by the federal government--

37:49.016 --> 37:50.559
Purportedly allows.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.145
Quoting from the statute,

37:53.229 --> 37:56.023
"When action is necessary
to alleviate health needs

37:56.107 --> 37:57.733
which are not being
reasonably satisfied--"

37:57.817 --> 38:00.695
Our attorneys would engage
on the interpretation of "reasonably."

38:00.778 --> 38:05.074
And when the patented product
is not, again, quoting,

38:05.157 --> 38:07.618
"available to the public
on reasonable terms--"

38:07.702 --> 38:10.246
White House wants to dictate
how we conduct our business?

38:11.163 --> 38:15.584
Sir, I'm not here to deliver a lecture
on moral responsibility.

38:15.668 --> 38:16.502
[scoffs]

38:16.585 --> 38:19.338
[Isabel] I understand you have
an obligation to your shareholders,

38:19.422 --> 38:21.507
your board, your bottom line.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.593
I'm not gonna use charged language

38:24.677 --> 38:27.346
or make hand-wringing appeals
to a public good

38:27.430 --> 38:30.850
that's essentially an irrelevance
to the American pharmaceutical business.

38:30.933 --> 38:32.935
Well, that language
sounds charged enough to me.

38:33.644 --> 38:37.398
On the contrary, sir.
I didn't use words like "unconscionable,"

38:37.481 --> 38:41.694
"avaricious,"
or the term I use at home, "extortionate."

38:41.777 --> 38:43.529
[Ralsch] I believe we've heard enough.

38:44.405 --> 38:46.032
Due respect, sir, you haven't.

38:55.291 --> 39:00.087
<i>Our son Alec Smith, who would be 27,</i>
<i>is no longer with us. </i>

39:00.171 --> 39:03.215
<i>What I miss most about Alec</i>
<i>is his hugs and his smiles. </i>

39:03.299 --> 39:06.594
<i>He had the goofiest grin, </i>

39:06.677 --> 39:12.516
<i>but it was so original and so unique</i>
<i>that I miss seeing that grin. </i>

39:13.059 --> 39:16.020
<i>The official cause of death</i>
<i>on my son's death certificate </i>

39:16.103 --> 39:18.230
<i>is diabetic ketoacidosis. </i>

39:18.314 --> 39:21.150
<i>Unofficially, the cause of death</i>
<i>is corporate greed. </i>

39:21.776 --> 39:24.195
<i>Insulin was created almost 100 years ago. </i>

39:24.278 --> 39:26.697
<i>These insulin companies,</i>
<i>they got it for free, </i>

39:26.781 --> 39:31.410
<i>so every penny that they have made</i>
<i>off of insulin in almost 100 years</i>

39:31.494 --> 39:32.661
<i>has been profit.</i>

39:32.745 --> 39:37.333
<i>It costs $6 to create a vial of insulin,</i>

39:37.416 --> 39:39.877
<i>but they're selling it for almost $400.</i>

39:40.586 --> 39:41.921
<i>The price of his life. </i>

39:43.506 --> 39:48.469
<i>Alec died from rationing his insulin</i>
<i>because he couldn't afford it. </i>

39:48.552 --> 39:52.765
<i>Now I have to live the rest of my life</i>
<i>without my son. </i>

39:53.391 --> 39:58.813
<i>A part of my soul is gone</i>
<i>because the greedy people </i>

39:58.896 --> 40:03.901
<i>think that it's okay to randomly increase</i>
<i>the price of life-saving medications </i>

40:03.984 --> 40:05.277
<i>to the point where they're unaffordable</i>

40:05.361 --> 40:07.738
<i>for the people who need them</i>
<i>to stay alive.</i>

40:08.906 --> 40:12.076
<i>It's unfair, it's unethical</i>
<i>and it's unjust,</i>

40:12.159 --> 40:14.036
<i>and it needs to end.</i>

40:16.622 --> 40:19.834
So no other mother
has to needlessly lose a child

40:19.917 --> 40:22.962
due to the unaffordability
of your life-sustaining drugs,

40:23.504 --> 40:28.843
we suggest you lower the price to this.

40:28.926 --> 40:32.138
Or we take away your patent
and award it to a competitor,

40:32.721 --> 40:35.266
and release videos like these
justifying why.

40:39.603 --> 40:40.604
[indistinct chatter]

40:40.688 --> 40:42.648
-[Seth] Here we go.
-Thanks.

40:45.484 --> 40:47.695
I don't know how I feel
about you having a beer.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.321
-Seth.
-Not "Dad"?

40:50.656 --> 40:52.533
-Too soon.
-[chuckles]

40:52.616 --> 40:54.285
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

40:54.910 --> 40:56.787
Meet your daughter, day one. Here it is.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.005
[exhales heavily]

41:06.964 --> 41:08.841
It's showtime, Mr. President.

41:12.887 --> 41:13.721
[Tom] Thank you.

41:18.434 --> 41:19.310
[exhales heavily]

41:20.853 --> 41:26.025
When you're ready.
Five, four, three, two, and we're live.

41:26.609 --> 41:30.446
My fellow Americans,
wherever you are viewing this tonight,

41:30.529 --> 41:33.282
your options in this new era
seem limitless.

41:33.365 --> 41:36.994
So I have chosen to speak to you
in this less-than-traditional fashion,

41:37.077 --> 41:41.373
streaming via smartphone, laptop,
satellite or onto your television,

41:41.457 --> 41:43.792
because I want you
to understand that I am trying

41:43.876 --> 41:47.796
to talk to each and every one of you
personally, as my fellow citizen.

41:48.422 --> 41:51.967
Not to any special interest groups
or corporate America.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.637
<i>To begin, I'd like to tell you</i>
<i>that I have chosen</i>

41:54.720 --> 41:58.182
<i>National Security Advisor Aaron Shore</i>
<i>to be my candidate for vice president.</i>

41:58.265 --> 41:59.266
-Hi.
-[Mars] Hello.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.478
[Tom] <i>I am very proud to have Aaron</i>
<i>as my running mate.</i>

42:02.561 --> 42:05.105
-What did I miss?
-Just the VP announcement. Go.

42:08.359 --> 42:11.445
Detailed information
on all these proposals and more

42:11.529 --> 42:15.157
will be posted on our campaign website
immediately following this address.

42:16.492 --> 42:20.538
On a personal note, there is something
I would like you to reflect on.

42:21.205 --> 42:24.792
Recent days have seen
egregious violations of personal privacy

42:24.875 --> 42:27.628
involving my sister-in-law
and one of my opponents.

42:28.254 --> 42:30.881
These incidents are connected
to what I believe to be

42:30.965 --> 42:34.677
a general erosion
of the concept of personal privacy.

42:34.760 --> 42:38.347
Sometimes we, as citizens,
are all too often complicit

42:38.430 --> 42:42.768
in the erasing of boundaries between our
public and private lives via social media.

42:42.851 --> 42:46.855
And we may also find ourselves
unwitting and often unwilling captors

42:46.939 --> 42:49.942
to algorithms
that invasively track our every click.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.152
In consideration of this,

42:52.236 --> 42:55.239
I will ask Congress
to authorize a new cabinet office,

42:55.322 --> 42:57.950
the Department of Digital Technology,

42:58.033 --> 43:01.662
to bring enlightened oversight
to our now hyperconnected world.

43:02.413 --> 43:06.250
Via the Internet, it has become
too easy to stir anger and fear

43:06.333 --> 43:07.501
where none is deserved.

43:08.168 --> 43:10.671
<i>My sister-in-law</i>
<i>is a perfect example of that.</i>

43:11.338 --> 43:14.883
<i>Sasha isn't a symbol</i>
<i>for either the intolerant or the activist.</i>

43:15.509 --> 43:17.177
<i>She is a fellow American citizen,</i>

43:17.261 --> 43:19.263
<i>endowed with the same inalienable rights</i>

43:19.346 --> 43:22.391
<i>to life, liberty and the pursuit</i>
<i>of happiness as all of us.</i>

43:23.225 --> 43:27.271
<i>Now, I am not so naive as to believe</i>
<i>that simply because we are all Americans, </i>

43:27.354 --> 43:29.315
<i>we will all agree on every issue.</i>

43:29.898 --> 43:32.026
<i>But if history teaches us anything, </i>

43:32.109 --> 43:35.904
<i>it is that our country's ability to be</i>
<i>understanding and tolerant of each other</i>

43:35.988 --> 43:38.073
<i>has made us</i>
<i>one of the great shining lights</i>

43:38.157 --> 43:39.742
<i>for democracy and the world.</i>

43:40.659 --> 43:43.746
<i>We arrive at tolerance and acceptance</i>
<i>by varied paths. </i>

43:44.413 --> 43:48.876
<i>Some come by it as a matter of course,</i>
<i>and some through time and experience. </i>

43:48.959 --> 43:51.378
<i>I've been blessed</i>
<i>to have Sasha in my life,</i>

43:51.462 --> 43:53.589
<i>someone who introduced me</i>
<i>to a life journey</i>

43:53.672 --> 43:55.799
<i>completely foreign to my understanding. </i>

43:56.425 --> 43:58.594
<i>And I will admit before all of you,</i>

43:58.677 --> 44:01.430
<i>my tolerance</i>
<i>and acceptance of her took time, </i>

44:01.972 --> 44:04.767
and even now, is more intellectual
than instinctive.

44:05.434 --> 44:09.104
But I will continue to work every day
to try and make myself whole.

44:09.688 --> 44:12.775
And I can only urge all Americans
to look into their own hearts,

44:13.484 --> 44:17.488
<i>where I believe they will find</i>
<i>their own compassion and understanding.</i>

44:18.614 --> 44:20.199
<i>My name is Tom Kirkman, </i>

44:20.282 --> 44:24.203
<i>and I present myself as a candidate</i>
<i>for the presidency of the United States.</i>

44:24.286 --> 44:26.747
Not as a partisan
of the right or the left,

44:27.331 --> 44:30.709
but as one of you,
the frustrated majority of Americans

44:30.793 --> 44:34.296
<i>who just want sensible solutions</i>
<i>to the issues of our time. </i>

44:34.380 --> 44:35.839
<i>In asking for your vote, </i>

44:35.923 --> 44:39.843
<i>I ask you to take this giant leap with me</i>
<i>away from politics as usual</i>

44:40.552 --> 44:42.429
<i>and declare your independence.</i>

44:42.513 --> 44:46.266
Thank you. Good night, and God bless you,

44:46.350 --> 44:48.686
and God bless
these United States of America.

44:48.769 --> 44:51.021
[all cheering]

45:01.698 --> 45:02.533
[Tom] Thank you.

45:02.616 --> 45:06.286
The Moss leak.
It wasn't the lab, and it wasn't me.

45:07.246 --> 45:10.666
I underestimated you.
Don't underestimate me.

45:23.011 --> 45:25.013
[theme music playing]
