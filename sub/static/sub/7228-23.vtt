[Doc reading]

01:02.395 --> 01:05.982
Ooh! Ooh!

01:06.566 --> 01:07.400
Dad!

01:07.484 --> 01:09.986
Just warming up
my spooky Halloween voices.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.363
Ooh!

01:12.989 --> 01:15.492
Boo!
Yep. I think I'm ready!

01:15.700 --> 01:17.994
Me, too!
I love Halloween!

01:18.078 --> 01:19.913
Like father,
like daughter.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.376
Ah, yes, sirree,
my little boo-buddy.

01:25.794 --> 01:29.589
I do believe this is
the best McStuffins'
McSpooky room

01:29.672 --> 01:30.799
we've ever done!

01:31.090 --> 01:33.760
Me, too.
And we open it in an hour!

01:34.302 --> 01:37.597
Oh! I've got something
new for this year's
"Spooky Spectacular!"

01:37.972 --> 01:38.807
What is it?

01:39.182 --> 01:40.183
Wait here.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.228
A jack-o'-lantern?

01:43.311 --> 01:45.814
But we have a ton
of those already.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.524
Not like this one.

01:47.607 --> 01:48.817
It has a motion sensor.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.401
When someone
walks by--

01:50.485 --> 01:51.402
Boo!

01:51.486 --> 01:54.364
[laughs] Scary!
[giggles]

01:56.825 --> 01:57.826
My turn!

01:58.034 --> 02:00.078
[whistles]

02:01.162 --> 02:02.247
Huh?

02:02.330 --> 02:03.998
[whistles]

02:04.457 --> 02:05.333
Hey.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.418
It's not working!

02:08.377 --> 02:10.630
Hmm. I'll have
to see what's
wrong with it--

02:10.964 --> 02:14.092
Oh! [chuckles]
My bat brownies
are done.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.468
I'll be right back.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.470
Dad, can I take this
to the clinic,

02:17.554 --> 02:19.973
see if I can figure out
why it isn't working?

02:20.056 --> 02:23.184
Sure, Doc. I don't know anyone
as good at fixing toys
as you.

02:23.601 --> 02:24.435
Me neither!

02:24.519 --> 02:25.770
As far as I know,

02:25.854 --> 02:27.981
I'm the best
toy doctor there is!

02:31.192 --> 02:32.610
The Doc is in!

02:40.702 --> 02:42.662
Happy Halloween, Doc!

02:42.745 --> 02:45.039
Happy Halloween,
everyone!

02:45.999 --> 02:48.501
I love all
your costumes!

02:48.585 --> 02:49.502
Thanks, Doc!

02:49.586 --> 02:50.545
You look great, too.

02:50.628 --> 02:51.671
I love mine, too.

02:51.754 --> 02:52.630
Aw, thanks.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.133
Chilly, what are
you dressed up as?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.260
A snowman!

02:57.510 --> 02:58.344
But...

03:00.847 --> 03:02.181
You look great!

03:02.515 --> 03:04.225
Aw, thanks!
I tried.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.185
Kids starting to
trick or treat yet?

03:07.145 --> 03:09.314
I love seeing
everyone's costumes.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.566
Not yet,
but they'll start soon!

03:13.568 --> 03:15.028
Aah! Pirate!

03:15.111 --> 03:16.279
Whoa!

03:16.571 --> 03:19.115
That's you
in a costume!

03:19.198 --> 03:21.701
Oh, yeah. [chuckles]
I knew that.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.162
Is it time for everyone
to come over

03:24.245 --> 03:26.831
for your McStuffins'
McSpooky party?

03:26.915 --> 03:29.292
You can't start the party
without your Halloween hippo!

03:29.375 --> 03:30.835
Hey-ho!

03:30.919 --> 03:32.670
I wouldn't think
of it, Hallie,

03:32.921 --> 03:35.006
but we have
a patient to see first.

03:35.256 --> 03:36.966
[stutters] What's in there?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.468
A-- A ghost?

03:38.718 --> 03:41.262
There's no
such thing as
ghosts, Chilly.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.847
No need
to be afraid.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.307
So what is
in there?

03:44.641 --> 03:45.475
A ghost.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.601
Aah!

03:47.060 --> 03:49.979
Wait. You took my line.
Aah!

03:50.063 --> 03:52.607
But it's a toy ghost
that my dad and I

03:52.690 --> 03:54.150
are using
in the spooky room.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.944
It's not any scarier
than you are.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.946
I can be scary!

03:58.321 --> 03:59.989
And I can be scared.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.909
[Sebastian] Hey.
Can someone get me
out of here?

04:03.284 --> 04:05.203
The top of my pumpkin
won't open!

04:05.453 --> 04:06.871
Don't worry. We will.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.206
What's your name?

04:08.289 --> 04:09.165
Sebastian.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.876
Sounds like someone
needs a checkup.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.211
I agree.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.545
I like them regularly.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.089
Not you! The ghost!

04:17.173 --> 04:18.632

I have a diagnosis!

04:58.172 --> 05:01.634
Sebastian, you have
Ghost-stuck-in-a-pumpkin
Syndrome.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.303
It's very rare.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.555
Let me see
if I can scare up

because, you know,
it's Halloween and all?

05:16.107 --> 05:17.150
Anybody?

05:18.109 --> 05:20.695
[Sebastian] Doc, how
are you going to fix it?

05:21.279 --> 05:24.073
I just need to
loosen this screw.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.619
I'm free!

05:28.703 --> 05:29.579
Aah! Ohh!

05:29.996 --> 05:31.205
What are you
scared of?

05:31.289 --> 05:35.126
Me? Scared? [chuckles]
I don't get scared.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.629
Oh, right.
Because you're a pirate!

05:38.713 --> 05:40.631
Stuffy's really
a dragon.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.467
He's dressed
in a costume.

05:42.759 --> 05:43.760
We all are.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.053
[Squeakers squeak]

05:45.136 --> 05:46.012
Hi, cute mouse.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.930
Squeakers
isn't a mouse.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.057
He's a fish!

05:49.140 --> 05:51.559
And Hallie is a hippo,
not a daisy.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.727
But don't you worry.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.313
I smell just
as sweet as
a daisy dipped

05:55.396 --> 05:57.523
in sugar-coated
sunshine!

05:58.024 --> 06:00.526
Lambie, she's a lamb,
not a rabbit,

06:01.152 --> 06:02.403
and I'm not
a cowgirl.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.404
I'm a Doctor.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.031
Don't know
if you can tell,

06:05.114 --> 06:06.449
but I'm a snowman.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.786
Wow. You guys look great,

06:10.078 --> 06:11.996
but why are
you dressed up?

06:12.580 --> 06:13.414
For Halloween.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.124
Haven't you
ever been?

06:15.500 --> 06:17.293
Um, no.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.420
This is my first one.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.548
Oh. Well, everyone
dresses up.

06:22.840 --> 06:23.800
You're gonna
love it!

06:24.175 --> 06:25.843

favorite holiday.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.261
My dad's, too.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.931
Hey, you're fixed,
so I can show you.

06:30.223 --> 06:36.062
It's time to open
our world famous
McStuffins' McSpooky room!

06:36.646 --> 06:38.898
Oh, yeah. Great.

06:40.274 --> 06:43.111
Almost done
with the McSpooky punch.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.654
How'd you do
with the ghost?

06:44.737 --> 06:45.655
He's all fixed.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.698
Great. I should be
done in a few,

06:47.782 --> 06:49.450
and then we can open
the doors.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.410
[laughs]

06:51.744 --> 06:54.580
You might want to keep
working on that one.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.377
-[Lambie] Wow!
-[Chilly] Amazing!

06:59.460 --> 07:00.294
[Stuffy] Far out!

07:00.378 --> 07:01.379
[Hallie] This is cool!

07:03.714 --> 07:04.674
Oh, a skeleton!

07:05.341 --> 07:06.300
And bats!

07:06.676 --> 07:07.927
And they don't
look friendly.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.470
Oh, I don't
like Halloween.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.805
It's scary!

07:10.888 --> 07:12.432
Ohh! A witch!

07:12.515 --> 07:13.766
Aah!

07:14.100 --> 07:14.976
Sebastian?

07:15.059 --> 07:17.311
Maybe he wants us
to give him a try!

07:17.395 --> 07:19.856
Someone just has to walk
in front of him, right?

07:19.939 --> 07:21.441
Let me handle this.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.151
Nothing scares me!

07:23.693 --> 07:25.570
Aah! Except spiders.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.904
Scared of spiders.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.198
[squeaking]

07:30.658 --> 07:33.578
[laughs] Of course
this spider isn't real,

07:33.661 --> 07:36.080
which I knew all along.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.458
Oh, I love a good scare
that turns out

07:38.541 --> 07:40.001
not to be scary!

07:40.334 --> 07:42.879
Stuffy, walk in front
of that pumpkin already,
will you?

07:46.007 --> 07:47.717
Huh.
It didn't work.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.305
[grunting]

07:54.307 --> 07:56.517
oh, there's definitely
something wrong.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.854
Oh, no! Sebastian
must have had a relapse

07:59.937 --> 08:01.856
of Ghost-stuck-in-a-pumpkin
Syndrome.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.026
Ooh! Not a relapse!
That's terrible.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.236
Uh, what's
a relapse again?

08:07.612 --> 08:10.323
It's when something
you already had
comes back again.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.116
Don't worry, Sebastian.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.409
I'll give you
another checkup.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.455
Huh. His latch
isn't stuck.

08:17.538 --> 08:20.333
So it's not Ghost-stuck-
in-a-pumpkin Syndrome?

08:20.750 --> 08:22.001
Doesn't look like it.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.755
Sebastian,
can you come out?

08:26.130 --> 08:28.341
Oh. Uh, okay.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.260
[rapid heartbeat]

08:32.678 --> 08:34.764
Your heart is beating
really fast,

08:34.847 --> 08:36.182
and you're shaking.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.726
Yeah. I can't stop.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.145
Aw. You need
a cuddle.

08:43.438 --> 08:44.315
Thanks.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.692
Heart beating fast,
shaking,

08:46.776 --> 08:49.570
and a cuddle
makes you feel better.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.240
Sebastian,
are you scared?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.367
Yeah, I am.

08:54.825 --> 08:58.120
I know I'm a ghost
and I'm supposed to be
scaring everyone else,

08:58.204 --> 09:00.998
but... I'm scared.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.626
I know everyone looks
scary on Halloween,

09:04.001 --> 09:05.836
but it's all pretend.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.921
Really?

09:07.004 --> 09:08.464
Those skeletons
and witches

09:08.548 --> 09:10.174
don't look
very friendly.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.093
[Doc] That's Hazel.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.011
She's pretending
to be scary,

09:14.345 --> 09:16.472
but she's so nice.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.687
Why don't I introduce you,

09:22.770 --> 09:25.064
and you can see
how sweet she is.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.190
Hi, Hazel!

09:26.274 --> 09:27.358
Hi, doll!

09:27.441 --> 09:28.859
Don't you look
adorable

09:28.943 --> 09:31.445
all decked out
in the cowgirl costume?

09:31.529 --> 09:32.863
[giggles] Thanks!

09:32.947 --> 09:35.241
This is my friend,
Sebastian.

09:35.324 --> 09:36.993
Hi, Sebastian!

09:39.078 --> 09:41.956
Welcome to the spooky room,
Sebastian.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.499
Nice folks here.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.168
You need anything,
just give a call.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.212
Uh, thanks!

09:50.840 --> 09:53.843
You're all so nice.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.470
Maybe Halloween
is going to be fun
after all.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.848
Oh, it definitely is.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.264
You know what?

10:40.348 --> 10:43.809
I think Halloween
is my favorite holiday,
too!

10:43.893 --> 10:45.519
-Yay!
-Way to go!

10:45.603 --> 10:46.979
And you're not scared?

10:47.063 --> 10:52.276
Nope. Now I know
that everything
is just pretend.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.654
I think I'm
ready to get down

10:54.737 --> 10:58.032
to spooky business!

10:58.115 --> 11:00.993
We should probably
take this baby
for a test drive,

11:01.077 --> 11:02.745
make sure it's
working all right.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.414
[hums]

11:05.498 --> 11:06.832
-Boo!
-Aah!

11:08.292 --> 11:10.836
You do remember
that everything
is pretend, right?

11:11.420 --> 11:13.589
There's nothing
to be scared of.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.591
Oh, yeah. Right.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.095
Of course I know that.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.846
[Dad] Ready to open up,
Doc?

11:21.305 --> 11:23.265
Guys, are you ready?

11:23.349 --> 11:24.517
You bet!

11:25.559 --> 11:26.602
[squeak]

11:29.105 --> 11:30.648
And, Doc, thanks!

11:30.981 --> 11:32.066
Anytime.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.694
Nice costume!

11:35.986 --> 11:38.197
Thanks!
This place looks--

11:38.280 --> 11:39.198
-Boo!
-Whoa!

11:39.281 --> 11:40.199
[giggles]

11:40.616 --> 11:42.743
Dad, it's not real.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.328
You're right, Doc.
It's not.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.246
Boo!

11:45.746 --> 11:48.207
And that's why
I love Halloween!

11:48.290 --> 11:49.208
Me too!

11:49.291 --> 11:50.584
Let's open the doors.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.044
After you.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.507
-Trick or treat!
-Happy Halloween.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.008
Come on in.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.469
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

12:01.262 --> 12:03.597
Spiders? Skeletons!

12:03.681 --> 12:05.724
-Boo!
-Aah! Awesome.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.435
This room, like,
totally rocks.

12:07.768 --> 12:08.769
-Boo!
-Aah!

12:08.853 --> 12:10.980
[Dad] Boo!

12:11.313 --> 12:13.190
-[Doc] Dad!
-[all laugh]

12:14.859 --> 12:16.777
[Doc reading]

12:17.611 --> 12:18.821
Donny, Donny!

12:18.904 --> 12:20.197
Look at my face!

12:20.281 --> 12:21.365
Ah! [laughing]

12:21.824 --> 12:24.493
[laughs]
Check out my face!

12:24.577 --> 12:26.078
[both laughing]

12:28.956 --> 12:30.583
[Donny] Our fort is awesome!

12:31.000 --> 12:32.209
[Doc] And dark!

12:33.335 --> 12:35.671
I want to show
you something. Hold on!

12:35.754 --> 12:36.755
What is it?

12:36.839 --> 12:37.882
You'll see!

12:38.883 --> 12:40.092
Here he is!

12:40.176 --> 12:41.260
It's Glo-bo!

12:41.343 --> 12:42.761
He glows in the dark.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.388
Wait till you see!

12:47.141 --> 12:48.851
Uh, I don't
see anything.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.519
Hey, me neither.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.354
He's not glowing!

12:54.190 --> 12:56.233
He glowed last time
I played with him.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.651
I don't know
what's wrong.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.196
Why don't you let me
take a look at him?

13:00.279 --> 13:03.991
It might be a tough case,
but I bet I can get
his glow back.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.826
Cool. Thanks, Doc!

13:10.748 --> 13:12.208
[Doc] The Doc is in!

13:17.171 --> 13:18.547
[all] Glo-bo!

13:19.089 --> 13:21.634
Hi, guys. [heavy sigh]

13:22.259 --> 13:25.262
Glo-bo! It's great
to see you, old buddy!

13:26.305 --> 13:28.015
You're always
the life of the party!

13:28.974 --> 13:29.975
Fist bump.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.186
Give me five?

13:33.020 --> 13:34.021
[heavy sigh]

13:34.438 --> 13:36.190
Oh, yeah,
and you've got

13:36.273 --> 13:38.776
the strongest cuddle
I've ever felt!

13:39.318 --> 13:41.654
Lay one on me,
big guy!

13:41.737 --> 13:44.198
A cuddle?
Uh, sure.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.491
That's sounds nice.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.577
[chuckles]

13:49.161 --> 13:50.162
Huh?

13:51.455 --> 13:54.542
Well, that's not
the old Glo-bo cuddle
I remember.

13:55.751 --> 13:56.752
[sighs]

13:57.002 --> 13:58.379
I know!

13:58.462 --> 14:00.714
Usually he's
jumping around,

14:00.798 --> 14:02.424
waving all his arms...

14:02.758 --> 14:04.843
Dancing all over the place

14:05.386 --> 14:06.887
Glo-bo isn't
as energetic

14:06.971 --> 14:08.556
as I remember him
either.

14:08.639 --> 14:12.685
Hmm. You do look
a little droopy
and soupy, sugar.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.353
Yeah, I know.

14:14.728 --> 14:18.482
I haven't been
my go-go-Glo-bo self
for a while now.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.901
Hey, Glo-bo.
Can we see you glow?

14:21.235 --> 14:22.945
You're so good
at it!

14:23.028 --> 14:25.531
Well, sure.
I'd love to glow!

14:25.823 --> 14:27.533
Maybe that'll make
me feel better.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.035
Let's make it
dark in here.
Wait, Glo-bo. It--

14:30.119 --> 14:31.287
It's no trouble,
Doc.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.247
I love to make
the people happy!

14:33.789 --> 14:34.957
[grunting]

14:35.416 --> 14:36.417
[Stuffy] I'm on it!

14:41.463 --> 14:42.840
[Squeakers squeaking]

14:43.841 --> 14:44.925
How do I look?

14:45.009 --> 14:47.469
Do I positively glow?

14:48.512 --> 14:49.388
Well...

14:49.805 --> 14:50.764
No.

14:50.848 --> 14:51.932
You're not glowing!

14:52.349 --> 14:54.184
I'm not?
Why can't I glow?

14:54.268 --> 14:56.312
I'm usually
so good at glowing.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.938
Don't worry, Glo-bo.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.732
We'll figure out
what's wrong.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.734
[squeals]

15:02.651 --> 15:04.111
A little help here?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.365
[Stuffy] Here comes Glo-bo!

15:09.950 --> 15:12.244
There he goes.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.371
Love to,
little dragon buddy,

15:14.455 --> 15:16.498
but I-- I don't
have the energy!

15:16.582 --> 15:18.417
Lambie
to the rescue.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.252
Whoo-hoo!

15:23.172 --> 15:24.089
Thanks!

15:24.173 --> 15:25.633
Aw, no problem.

15:27.384 --> 15:30.804
Oh, Glo-bo,
you not glowing
is like...

15:31.096 --> 15:34.433
like if I didn't give
cuddles anymore!

15:34.683 --> 15:37.603
Or if I wasn't
very, very brave!

15:37.978 --> 15:40.022
Yeah. Not the same.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.441
Glo-bo, we'll
get you all
checked out

15:42.524 --> 15:43.609
and see
what's wrong.

15:43.943 --> 15:44.944
Thanks, Doc.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.154
I really want
my glow back.

15:49.531 --> 15:50.658
Open wide.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.452
Mmm.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.371
I don't feel good.

15:55.871 --> 15:58.082
You're definitely tired.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.667
Tired?
I get tired!

16:00.125 --> 16:02.628
I get tired every night
at bedtime!

16:02.920 --> 16:04.838
Is something wrong
with me, Doc?

16:04.922 --> 16:08.634
Chilly, everyone gets
tired at bedtime,

16:08.717 --> 16:11.637
but Glo-bo is really
tired during the day.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.681
Ooh, got it.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.350
Glo-bo, have you been
getting enough sleep?

16:16.850 --> 16:18.394
Yeah. I'm getting
tons of sleep,

16:18.936 --> 16:20.312
and I still
feel tired.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.816
Huh. Why are you
sleeping so much?

16:23.899 --> 16:27.152
Donny got a new train.
He's playing with him
most of the time,

16:27.236 --> 16:28.487
not that I blame Trevor.

16:28.696 --> 16:29.947
That's the new toy train.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.490
He's a nice guy.

16:31.573 --> 16:34.576
Real nice,
but I've been
in the toy box

16:34.660 --> 16:35.703
since he
came around,

16:36.286 --> 16:37.246
so I sleep.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.456
Sleeping too much.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.043
Lots of time
in the toy box.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.461
What does he have?

16:44.545 --> 16:46.005
I don't know.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.715
This is a tough case.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.509
I don't have
the answers yet!

16:52.553 --> 16:55.639
Ooh! That sun
feels good!

16:56.098 --> 16:58.392
Doc, mind if I go
outside for a sec

16:58.475 --> 16:59.685
while you're
figuring it out?

16:59.768 --> 17:01.103
Sure, Glo-bo.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.479
We'll come too!

17:02.563 --> 17:04.147
Yeah, and we'll
keep you company.

17:04.397 --> 17:05.398
Thanks, guys.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.737
I got to
figure this out.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.906
Whoa! That sun
is bright,

17:14.324 --> 17:16.827
but it feels nice.

17:17.243 --> 17:19.538
Ohh. It really does.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.040
Oh, yeah. It's good
to move this arm

17:23.083 --> 17:24.084
and this one.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.919
Oh, and this one, too,

17:26.002 --> 17:28.464
and also these three!

17:28.797 --> 17:29.882
Hey! Hey! I--

17:29.965 --> 17:32.384
I gotta say,
I'm starting to feel
a little better.

17:33.802 --> 17:35.721
Could it be
No-vroom-vroom-atosis?

17:36.430 --> 17:37.890
No. He's not a car.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.476
Maybe it's Eyeswide-itis.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.853
But he's been sleeping.

17:43.687 --> 17:45.522
Hmm. What could it be?

17:45.898 --> 17:46.732
[Glo-bo] watch this!

17:47.149 --> 17:50.319
28, 29, 30,
32, 35--

17:50.402 --> 17:51.904
I'm not too good
at math.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.989
38, 50.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.616
I did 50 push-ups!

17:56.325 --> 17:58.660
Wow! That's amazing!

17:58.744 --> 18:00.496
You think
that's amazing?

18:00.704 --> 18:01.830
Check this out.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.415
Three-handed!

18:05.125 --> 18:07.377
Yep. Starting to feel
like my old self again!

18:07.920 --> 18:09.797
That's the old
Glo-bo we know!

18:09.880 --> 18:11.215
And love!

18:11.632 --> 18:14.635
I am "The Glo-binator!"

18:14.718 --> 18:16.178
Come here
and give me some.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.596
[babbling]

18:18.555 --> 18:20.599
Glo-bo went outside...

18:21.225 --> 18:22.976
and now he's
feeling better.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.605
Hallie. I think
I figured out
the problem!

18:28.023 --> 18:31.485
Hey, Glo-bo,
when was the last time
you went outside

18:31.568 --> 18:32.569
before today?

18:32.861 --> 18:35.447
Well, um, I honestly
can't remember, Doc.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.741
I think I've been
inside that dark toy box

18:37.825 --> 18:39.827
for a couple
of weeks at least.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.829
I have a diagnosis!

18:41.912 --> 18:42.996
What is it, Doc?

18:43.455 --> 18:45.791
Yeah. Why can't
Glo-bo glow?

18:46.166 --> 18:49.086
Glo-bo has
No-glow-a-tosis!

18:49.419 --> 18:50.587
No-glow-a-who-sis?

When you stay inside

you can get tired out!

tired out
by doing nothing?

19:04.726 --> 19:07.396
Yep! Getting outside
and exercising

19:07.479 --> 19:08.522
gives you energy,

19:08.897 --> 19:11.984
and I think Glo-bo
needs exercise and sun

19:12.067 --> 19:13.110
so he can glow.
