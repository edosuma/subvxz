WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:05.870
- You must know your age.
- My parents were really vague.

00:05.920 --> 00:08.390
I told you about when they
left me in the playground

00:08.440 --> 00:11.710
- and took another child home.
- Do you have a birth certificate?

00:11.760 --> 00:14.270
No, they didn't believe in paperwork.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.750
Animals don't know when they were
born. It doesn't bother them.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.910
Will you stop making stupid parallels

00:19.960 --> 00:21.680
between animals and humans?

00:22.720 --> 00:24.190
Animals don't call you stupid.

00:24.240 --> 00:28.550
Bearing in mind I have no money,
what do you want for your birthday?

00:28.600 --> 00:30.470
I would like the gift of knowing that

00:30.520 --> 00:34.190
- you are all spirited and fulfilled.
- I'll find you some nice driftwood.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.990
I'll shoot something for you.

00:36.040 --> 00:39.470
I'm not sure a bleeding corpse
strikes the right festive note.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.160
Oh, God, you're turning into Larry.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.790
He's not dead, he's a mile away.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.080
I know.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.920
In a bar.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.800
Well, we'll give you a fabulous birthday.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.550
- Thank you.
- Whatever age you are,

00:59.600 --> 01:02.440
we will celebrate you in
all your wizened glory.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.670
[He has brought us that animal.]

01:55.720 --> 01:57.640
Breakfast! Come and get it.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.070
Fish!

02:00.120 --> 02:03.030
If I don't milk you, you
will fill up and explode!

02:06.640 --> 02:10.550
Freshly caught by Leslie... grumpily.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.600
Don't be shy.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.630
Someone's making an effort for Hugh.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.550
- Huuuugh. - Hughie. - Shush.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.510
I'm not sure she is pregnant, you know.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.270
If we're not careful otters
will die out on Corfu.

02:44.320 --> 02:45.430
Oh!

02:45.480 --> 02:47.830
So, I've laid out your best clothes,

02:47.880 --> 02:51.230
Margo will smarten your hair.
And get the muck off his face.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.310
And you know the way to Mr Kralefsky's.

02:53.360 --> 02:57.480
Please work hard, Gerry, it's really
difficult to find a good tutor.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.080
Urgh.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.560
It's probably open.

03:18.640 --> 03:19.920
Larry?

03:21.280 --> 03:25.670
- I thought you'd be up, writing.
- I aim always to surprise.

03:25.720 --> 03:29.470
Well, you said you left home
to experience life in the raw.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.750
I've worn the same
underwear for two weeks.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.600
You don't get much more raw than that.

03:34.760 --> 03:39.070
Well, it's just as well I
brought you these, then.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.200
Oh.

03:43.360 --> 03:47.230
Mum, Ernest Hemingway's parents
don't bring him Battenberg cake.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.440
Or do they?

03:50.080 --> 03:51.480
Where's your typewriter?

03:55.320 --> 03:57.550
Oh, yes, I've been doing some boxing.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.510
Tell them not to hit your face.

03:59.560 --> 04:03.590
- I usually do, actually.
- Here. Come on, then.

04:03.640 --> 04:06.550
You will brush your teeth
later on, won't you, darling?

04:06.600 --> 04:08.360
I'll see how I feel.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.470
Anyway, how are you?

04:11.520 --> 04:13.870
I miss your intelligent conversation.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.910
I mentioned communism recently.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.950
- Margo still thinks it means being --
- Being common, yes, I know.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.070
She's not dim, she's
just... not interested.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.310
I can talk to you like you're my age.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.460
Well, hardly.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.630
I'll be right down!

04:31.680 --> 04:35.070
Ah, I wondered why you
were dressed to kill.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.350
Or at least dressed to wound.

04:37.400 --> 04:40.110
- How is it?
- Fine.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.550
But...?

04:41.600 --> 04:44.430
But I don't want to rush
into another entanglement.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.750
I still wonder about Sven.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.430
Those are excuses for
only living half a life.

04:50.480 --> 04:53.270
It's not an excuse, you irritant.

04:54.820 --> 04:55.870
Life's complicated.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.110
Emotions ebb and flow.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.110
Men let you down.

05:00.160 --> 05:04.920
Your children have started to leave
home. What are you waiting for?

05:17.280 --> 05:19.280
~

05:32.200 --> 05:33.990
Whoo!

05:34.040 --> 05:37.150
- Doesn't she corner gracefully?
- Mmm.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.110
Who would you save in
a fire, me or the car?

05:43.160 --> 05:46.070
That's like asking you which
of your children you'd choose.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.750
Which of yours would you save?

05:49.800 --> 05:51.920
Please don't ever have children.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.320
- Yours?
- Mine.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.910
A grove of Olea europaea.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.870
Two thousand years old.

06:09.920 --> 06:13.630
If Christ ever holidayed in
Corfu he may have slept under it.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.390
Hmm. And if one ever
worried about one's age,

06:16.440 --> 06:19.350
- it would be the perfect antidote.
- I agree.

06:19.400 --> 06:24.200
Without wishing to generalise,
young women are raving mad.

06:25.400 --> 06:30.270
You mean, and I note in passing
that I'm no longer considered young,

06:30.320 --> 06:31.760
Vasilia?

06:32.720 --> 06:34.520
Yes, all right.

06:36.240 --> 06:40.390
- How dangerous is she?
- She killed a lover.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.790
- What?!
- Well, he... he died.

06:42.840 --> 06:46.830
He probably deserved it. Life is messy.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.190
But enough about her.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.760
We have a day of fun ahead of us.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.390
To the seaside!

06:58.400 --> 06:59.710
Oh!

07:13.160 --> 07:14.880
Hello!

07:17.560 --> 07:19.320
How embarrassing.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.310
OK back there in the cheap seats?

07:23.360 --> 07:25.750
Smugness can be very ugly, Spiros.

07:25.800 --> 07:30.240
I suggest you buy more reliable
transportation, like a donkey.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.870
No chance.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.070
He's too... handsome.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.070
I deserve someone handsome.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.550
I liked it more when you
were trying to be a nun.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.800
I may get back to that when I'm old.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.750
Talking of old, what are we going
to do for Mother's birthday?

07:59.800 --> 08:02.990
Well, she needs cheering
up because of missing Larry.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.790
Let's give her a special
picnic and get him over.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.560
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.990
- Theo! - Gerry. Oh,
I like your new look!

08:12.040 --> 08:14.030
Where is the wild urchin of yesteryear?

08:14.080 --> 08:15.990
He's about to go to his new tutor.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.750
Oh, yes, time to fill in the
little gaps in your knowledge.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.150
I'd rather be out
photographing nature with you.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.470
I snapped a splendid fan-tailed
warbler earlier today.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.670
I'd love to take photos. All
the fun of shooting with guns

08:27.720 --> 08:29.470
and you get a picture at the end of it.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.110
The perfect birthday present.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.429
Come to my house later and I'll
talk you through the developing.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.909
- Oh.
- Time to go, Gerry.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.240
Show me.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.280
- Lovely. - Acceptable. - Delightful.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.430
Hello!

08:47.480 --> 08:50.080
Monsieur Durrell. Bien arrive.

08:51.080 --> 08:56.080
This is so exciting. I've never
done anything creative before.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.390
Every family has room for one.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.560
And Larry got in early.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.800
Maybe this is your future.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.310
I love this.

09:13.360 --> 09:18.560
So, what do they produce
here in Warwickshire?

09:19.680 --> 09:21.710
- Wallpaper?
- No.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.190
- String?
- No.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.350
Wigs? Bananas?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.350
Now I think you are guessing.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.950
- Coal, or motorcycles.
- Oh.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.970
Or, of course, playwrights!

09:34.720 --> 09:36.310
William Shakespeare.

09:36.360 --> 09:39.280
Oh, of course! Yes, The Barb.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.870
- The Bard.
- Yes.

09:42.920 --> 09:47.270
You seem like a decent boy, Gerald,
but I have much to teach you.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.710
Oh, I don't wish to boast, Mr Kralefsky,

09:49.760 --> 09:53.870
- but I do know a lot about nature.
- That will get you nowhere in life.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.720
Do excuse me, I must go to see Mother.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.600
The prettiest Durrell.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.960
Thank you.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.400
What are you doing here?

10:26.280 --> 10:27.960
Write me a love poem.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.440
And why would I do that?

10:32.400 --> 10:35.040
Because now you are thinking about me.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.510
Smaller.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.310
Smaller!

10:45.360 --> 10:47.760
It's tiny. You're eating for two.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.680
I'm so jealous of you.
Starting out. New life.

10:55.800 --> 10:59.520
None of this sense of the
years ticking remorselessly by.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.430
You really are taking this
birthday to heart, aren't you?

11:03.480 --> 11:07.200
You can start a new family with one
of your men. Look, there's one.

11:08.680 --> 11:12.510
Oh, Sven. He looks pleased with himself.

11:12.560 --> 11:13.680
Mmmm.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.600
- What?
- What?

11:18.560 --> 11:20.870
There are rumours that
he has a girlfriend.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.710
Oh, right.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.470
Well, good.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.990
I don't think you mean good.

11:27.040 --> 11:30.630
I know he was fighting it, but I
assumed his homosexuality would win.

11:30.680 --> 11:31.800
I know.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.440
- Who is it? It's not
Vasilia, is it? - No.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.240
Nobody seems to know her.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.150
I hope to God she's plain and ancient.

11:46.520 --> 11:50.870
- We could have been married.
- Louisa, you did the right thing.

11:50.920 --> 11:54.070
Then why does it make me feel so sad?

11:54.120 --> 11:58.960
♪ There's no escape that I can see

12:00.440 --> 12:04.760
♪ But still those little things remain

12:06.000 --> 12:12.040
♪ That bring me happiness or pain...

12:18.640 --> 12:21.950
- You just killed a living creature.
- Yes. And I will kill again.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.590
- Do we really need the hedgehog?
- Yes, he's poorly.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.830
I'm making sure he eats and drinks.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.320
Well, if he doesn't pull
through -- shoe brush!

12:32.320 --> 12:35.310
- Little sausage? My speciality.
- No, thank you, darling.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.430
I had rather a lot of cake earlier.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.840
Larry did not come.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.920
I'm sure he's busy preparing
a spectacular present.

12:47.880 --> 12:50.150
How is your new tutor, Gerry?

12:50.200 --> 12:52.910
He keeps saying he "must
go and see Mother",

12:52.960 --> 12:55.030
even though he looks really old.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.270
- It's a euphemism.
- Well done, Leslie.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.910
From the Greek eu, "well", and pheme.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.830
Clearly not much interest there.

13:01.880 --> 13:05.510
I think it's his polite way of
saying he needs the lavatory, darling.

13:05.560 --> 13:09.470
Lavatory itself is a euphemism, of
course, meaning "place of washing".

13:09.520 --> 13:11.280
- Oh!
- Even less interest.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.230
Oh! I have a present.

13:14.280 --> 13:17.590
Oh! Gosh!

13:17.640 --> 13:21.270
Well, what could this be?

13:21.320 --> 13:23.520
- A new lavatory seat.
- No.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.170
A fossil.

13:26.920 --> 13:30.150
Specifically a Mamites Ammonite
from the Cretaceous age.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.760
Well, thank you, Theo.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.790
Theo's lent me a camera.
I'm going to take portraits.

13:35.840 --> 13:38.910
And I'm going to be
photographed, looking fabulous.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.790
You get a camera, I get a reminder I'm going
to be embedded in a cliff face one day.

13:42.840 --> 13:46.830
- We're on an ant hill!
- We're not. Let's have some cake.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.750
[Come here, you!]

13:48.800 --> 13:51.790
I wanted to get candles but I
couldn't get hold of enough.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.590
Right, well, that's it.

13:53.640 --> 13:56.470
- Ants on the cake!
- Shut up, Lugaretzia.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.150
- How old do you all think I am?
- Don't answer.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.040
No, I mean it, come on. How old?

14:03.200 --> 14:04.680
Thirty-five at the most.

14:05.960 --> 14:09.550
So when Larry born, she was...

14:09.600 --> 14:11.350
Thirteen.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.830
No, but I was very young.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.030
- I don't know, are you 50?
- That sounds about right.

14:17.080 --> 14:20.550
So it's probably time to act more
sedated, like The Queen Mary.

14:20.600 --> 14:24.870
I see you more as a
slow-moving giant turtle.

14:24.920 --> 14:28.150
Right, well, this has been delightful.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.190
- Oh, are you not 50?
- No, I am not 50!

14:31.240 --> 14:35.430
And I don't see myself as a
slow-moving turtle, Gerry.

14:35.480 --> 14:36.870
More of a sea-lion perhaps?

14:36.920 --> 14:41.110
- I see myself as a woman in her prime.
- Yes, Gerry.

14:41.160 --> 14:44.110
And though maybe not as young
as Sven's new girlfriend,

14:44.160 --> 14:48.280
I am young and I am fun and
I will not let you forget it.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.480
Oh, go away! You're too late.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.530
I suppose part of this is about
me having children so young.

15:23.580 --> 15:25.820
I spent my 20s changing nappies.

15:26.980 --> 15:28.530
Enjoy your youth while you can.

15:28.580 --> 15:31.980
- What did Aunt Hermione send you?
- Some birthday money.

15:37.740 --> 15:39.330
Oh!

15:39.380 --> 15:44.010
I'm going to buy something
frivolous. Like a trip to Venice.

15:44.060 --> 15:47.050
- Or some roller skates.
- Mother, you're not 18.

15:47.100 --> 15:50.330
- Have you not been listening to me?
- I thought we were short of money.

15:50.380 --> 15:53.170
Well, we are. But I've paid
Spiros back a little bit,

15:53.220 --> 15:56.210
and, well, Vasilia doesn't
seem so desperate for the rent.

15:56.260 --> 16:00.130
Well, you can relax because I'm going
to make money by being a photographer.

16:00.180 --> 16:02.650
How many photographs have
you taken in your life?

16:04.460 --> 16:05.660
One.

16:06.740 --> 16:10.130
But I have Theo's excellent book.
And a powerful urge to succeed.

16:10.180 --> 16:13.050
Fabulous. You'll have
to practise lots first.

16:13.100 --> 16:15.370
Ooh, start with me.

16:17.740 --> 16:22.250
Yes, now tilt your head to the side
a bit so we can't see your spot.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.140
- That's lovely.
- Oh, no!

16:25.300 --> 16:29.490
- It's enormous.
- No, it's not. You look divine.

16:29.540 --> 16:31.410
I'll never find a man who loves me.

16:31.460 --> 16:34.220
Darling, love isn't everything.

16:35.220 --> 16:39.660
~

16:45.460 --> 16:48.660
- ~
- You sound happy.

16:50.460 --> 16:53.850
In fact, it's a ballad about
evil trolls who eat children.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.290
Very Swedish.

16:55.340 --> 16:58.780
- Well, you made it sound very jolly.
- I'm kidding, it's a love song.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.050
So what brings you to me?

17:02.100 --> 17:03.490
You're an expert on goats

17:03.540 --> 17:06.339
and Leslie was wondering how
often he should milk them.

17:07.579 --> 17:10.180
- Once a day.
- Thank you.

17:12.020 --> 17:14.010
I-I heard you had a girlfriend.

17:14.060 --> 17:16.980
- Oh, did you?
- Is it true?

17:17.660 --> 17:20.250
You once told me, no man is an island.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.810
I'm sorry, it's none of my business.

17:23.859 --> 17:28.690
How's, er, what's his name, Huge?

17:28.740 --> 17:29.810
Hugh.

17:29.860 --> 17:31.500
And I wouldn't say he's huge.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.770
Always nice to see you.

17:35.820 --> 17:37.490
Wait!

17:37.540 --> 17:39.810
You've done something to your...

17:39.860 --> 17:41.180
Well...

17:42.780 --> 17:44.900
- Looks good.
- Thank you.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.940
Do... keep singing.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.730
I shouldn't be eating this, really.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.290
It's Mother's way of
creating dependency in me.

18:03.340 --> 18:05.690
Or she just likes cooking.

18:05.740 --> 18:08.850
And why does she like cooking?
It's where her power resides.

18:08.900 --> 18:11.570
She's like a despot whose weapon is pie.

18:11.620 --> 18:14.090
Don't be mean. She misses you.

18:14.140 --> 18:16.010
I miss her.

18:16.060 --> 18:18.450
While she's having a crisis,

18:18.500 --> 18:21.700
you just stay here in
your little hidey-hole.

18:26.380 --> 18:29.130
- So, are you dragging lots
of girls up here? - Mmm.

18:29.180 --> 18:31.180
There's a couple under the bed.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.420
What?

18:36.620 --> 18:40.050
Don't tell Mother, but
Vasilia came to see me.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.210
You mustn't get together with her.

18:42.260 --> 18:43.690
- I won't!
- She's a nightmare.

18:43.740 --> 18:46.490
She's our landlady. She'll
evict us if we're not careful.

18:46.540 --> 18:48.460
I know. I'm not an idiot.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.050
I can't believe it, another spot.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.610
It's thwarted hormones. Get a boyfriend.

18:58.660 --> 19:00.970
I won't now I've got three spots.

19:01.020 --> 19:03.570
- Settle for anyone half-decent. - No!

19:03.620 --> 19:06.410
I'm holding out for someone gorgeous.

19:06.460 --> 19:09.900
But who's also aware of the
mass prejudice against women.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.450
Mrs Durrells, what are you doing?

19:22.500 --> 19:24.570
I'm living for the moment.

19:24.620 --> 19:25.780
What?

19:31.020 --> 19:32.620
Ooh!

19:34.620 --> 19:36.180
Oh, be a love.

19:46.140 --> 19:47.730
What are you doing?

19:47.780 --> 19:50.330
I'm assessing you for a portrait.

19:50.380 --> 19:53.970
Leslie has become a photographer.
He's got a studio and everything.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.330
He's brilliant.

19:55.380 --> 19:57.250
Let me photograph you, Spiros.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.330
- My rates are very reasonable.
- No.

19:59.380 --> 20:02.210
- I know what I look like.
- What about your wife and children?

20:02.260 --> 20:04.410
I especially know what they look like.

20:04.460 --> 20:06.850
You used to have a photo
of them on your windscreen.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.970
No, that was the Greek royal family.

20:10.020 --> 20:12.980
Similar -- much loved but very expensive.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.380
Ooh!

20:48.540 --> 20:51.050
Quel age as tu?

20:51.100 --> 20:52.970
Je m'appelle Gerry.

20:53.020 --> 20:54.010
Non!

20:54.060 --> 20:56.850
Je n'ai pas dit comment t'appelles-tu!

20:56.900 --> 21:00.260
Right. I can see you feel
quite strongly about that.

21:01.380 --> 21:03.850
Quel... age.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.820
as tu?

21:06.820 --> 21:09.060
Did I mention the je m'appelle Gerry?

21:17.940 --> 21:21.090
I'd love to know a bit more
about you, Mr Kralefsky.

21:21.140 --> 21:23.410
I'm sure you've led a fascinating life.

21:23.460 --> 21:25.580
Oh, yes, in fact I have.

21:28.900 --> 21:31.650
What was the most fascinating thing?

21:31.700 --> 21:32.420
Oh.

21:50.620 --> 21:52.330
Hello, Leslie.

21:52.380 --> 21:55.570
- Oh, hello.
- Where's your mother?

21:55.620 --> 21:58.170
- I'm glad you're here, actually.
- How is she?

21:58.220 --> 22:00.730
Brooding about Sven,
wanting to be 20 again.

22:00.780 --> 22:03.890
More importantly, I'm doing a
special offer on photo portraits

22:03.940 --> 22:05.770
- so do sign up.
- Certainly.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.090
Oh, good.

22:07.140 --> 22:09.580
Erm, I don't mean to pry, but, erm...

22:10.940 --> 22:12.970
.. what's the truth about Sven?

22:13.020 --> 22:14.930
Why didn't they marry?

22:14.980 --> 22:17.730
Well, they liked each other but not...

22:17.780 --> 22:20.810
Just not in the right way,
yes, I know the party line.

22:20.860 --> 22:23.490
It's just that I like your mother.

22:23.540 --> 22:26.980
And I-I want to understand
her a bit better.

22:32.180 --> 22:33.860
Sven...

22:35.180 --> 22:36.820
.. is a homosexual.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.170
Ah.

22:41.220 --> 22:43.370
You mustn't tell anyone. It's illegal.

22:43.420 --> 22:44.900
Yeah.

22:45.620 --> 22:47.620
Do you want to buy some sticky buns?

22:49.180 --> 22:50.890
I plunged my hand

22:50.940 --> 22:55.450
into the dog's mouth
and twisted his tongue.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.170
But I hung on grimly,

22:58.220 --> 23:02.420
for what seemed like an
age, until he went limp.

23:03.340 --> 23:07.970
The creature had been
suffocated by its own tongue.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.930
- Woah, blimey.
- And then...

23:09.980 --> 23:12.620
If you'll excuse me, I want
to "go and see Mother".

23:13.700 --> 23:16.250
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

23:16.300 --> 23:18.450
Oh! Very well.

23:18.500 --> 23:22.180
I will escort you.... This way.

23:26.620 --> 23:28.140
I'll be fine now.

23:29.340 --> 23:30.740
Mother?

23:33.100 --> 23:34.580
Mother, dear.

23:36.020 --> 23:38.380
Gerry here wanted to see you.

23:39.900 --> 23:41.810
Oh, I'm flattered.

23:41.860 --> 23:48.090
Nowadays so many people consider
a person of my age to be a bore.

23:48.140 --> 23:51.890
Goodness, no. I absolutely
wanted to see you.

23:51.940 --> 23:53.220
Come and sit down.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.780
Excuse me. I need the lavatory.

24:01.660 --> 24:04.850
- Where's the lamp? It's so dark.
- No, I've got too many spots.

24:04.900 --> 24:07.500
- I can't let anyone see them.
- Don't be ridiculous.

24:10.900 --> 24:12.260
So...

24:13.460 --> 24:15.140
.. what do you think?

24:16.940 --> 24:20.130
I think you should wear clothes
for your own age group.

24:20.180 --> 24:22.020
Oh. Really?

24:23.820 --> 24:27.170
Um, I don't want to worry you

24:27.220 --> 24:29.370
but Larry says Vasilia's after him.

24:29.420 --> 24:30.980
Larry's not that stupid.

24:49.300 --> 24:51.180
What brings you here?

24:53.500 --> 24:55.860
- English lessons or...?
- No.

24:57.060 --> 24:59.210
The teacher will be me, I think.

24:59.260 --> 25:02.690
Look, obviously you're
very easy on the eye,

25:02.740 --> 25:06.490
but you used to go out with my
mother's gentleman friend, so...

25:06.540 --> 25:08.010
Old history.

25:08.060 --> 25:11.980
But to quote James Joyce's
Ulysses: "History is a nightmare...

25:15.780 --> 25:19.540
.. from which I am trying to awake."

25:26.260 --> 25:28.770
How's your daughter's
pregnancy going, Lugaretzia?

25:28.820 --> 25:31.810
- She eat many anchovies.
- Oh.

25:31.860 --> 25:34.330
Well, I hear that's a common craving.

25:34.380 --> 25:38.460
- And newspaper.
- Probably not quite so common.

25:40.620 --> 25:42.570
Happy birthday.

25:42.620 --> 25:45.450
Oh, thank you. I-I thought
you didn't have any money.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.940
Well, to be honest this was cheap.

25:56.820 --> 25:57.940
Ooh.

25:59.620 --> 26:01.490
It's very comfy.

26:01.540 --> 26:04.530
It's very classical and
motherly. Promise you'll wear it?

26:04.580 --> 26:05.820
Yes.

26:07.180 --> 26:10.250
Not to do the gardening in. In public.

26:10.300 --> 26:11.810
Yes, in public.

26:11.860 --> 26:13.740
Thank you.

26:15.940 --> 26:17.100
Orea!

26:18.220 --> 26:22.610
He was a brute, and I cannot abide a man

26:22.660 --> 26:24.250
ill-treating a lady.

26:24.300 --> 26:27.490
So I instantly threw him onto his back,

26:27.540 --> 26:31.330
- shaming him, and won the lady. - Ah.

26:31.380 --> 26:34.690
But let us return to our French.

26:34.740 --> 26:37.690
- Quelle heure...?
- Please show me how you threw him.

26:37.740 --> 26:40.500
Oh, er, very well.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.580
Come at me.

26:45.140 --> 26:47.570
- Perhaps I shouldn't.
- As you wish.

26:47.620 --> 26:49.740
Quelle heure est-il?

26:52.220 --> 26:52.970
Oops.

26:54.220 --> 26:55.290
Oh, la la. Oh.

26:55.340 --> 26:57.180
Ah, no. Ah.

27:08.340 --> 27:09.490
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

27:09.540 --> 27:10.990
What do we look like?

27:12.140 --> 27:14.210
I don't normally arrive with a watermelon,

27:14.260 --> 27:18.530
but Leslie asked me to bring one
for my photographic portrait.

27:18.580 --> 27:20.170
Oh, I see.

27:21.220 --> 27:23.410
Do you normally walk pelicans?

27:23.460 --> 27:25.770
Um, yes, yes,

27:25.820 --> 27:29.220
Gerry likes his animals to have
a bit of a jaunt every day, so...

27:30.780 --> 27:33.250
Thank you. That's a nice big one.

27:33.300 --> 27:35.250
Do come in.

27:35.300 --> 27:37.500
You've decided to wear that, have you?

27:40.820 --> 27:43.610
Yes. Good idea, the addition of fruit.

27:43.660 --> 27:46.890
It's artistic, isn't it?
Look, it's in the book.

27:46.940 --> 27:48.260
Ah.

27:49.140 --> 27:51.810
Oh. Mm.

27:51.860 --> 27:55.650
So, what I'm doing is I'm
turning light into paper.

27:55.700 --> 27:57.300
- Ah.
- Shall we just...?

28:01.660 --> 28:03.770
There. There.

28:06.900 --> 28:09.010
Looks like you've found
your niche, Leslie.

28:09.060 --> 28:10.570
Well done.

28:10.620 --> 28:12.490
What's your niche?

28:12.540 --> 28:13.930
Olives.

28:13.980 --> 28:15.170
Nice.

28:15.220 --> 28:17.380
- Nice niche.
- Thank you.

28:22.860 --> 28:25.650
Ah! How was your photography session?

28:25.700 --> 28:27.050
Excellent.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.200
Have some watermelon. Leslie dropped it.

28:31.340 --> 28:32.930
Thank you.

28:32.980 --> 28:34.610
Um.

28:34.660 --> 28:36.380
You and me.

28:37.180 --> 28:40.170
Look, I know you don't
want to mire yourself

28:40.220 --> 28:43.330
- in another mismatch after Sven.
- No, no, I don't, but I...

28:43.380 --> 28:46.100
I know why you couldn't marry him.

28:52.060 --> 28:53.250
Louisa!

28:53.300 --> 28:55.940
You're behind the times, actually.

28:57.060 --> 28:59.330
He's... he's got a girlfriend.

28:59.380 --> 29:03.210
Oh, that's what it's all about. I see.

29:03.260 --> 29:05.170
Oh, hello, darling.

29:05.220 --> 29:08.690
Margo's got a couple of spots so
she's sent her face into hiding.

29:08.740 --> 29:10.730
Margo, perfection is tedious.

29:10.780 --> 29:12.820
- You're better than that.
- Thank you.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.810
Is that the dress I gave you?

29:15.860 --> 29:18.050
Er, yes, I've adapted it, actually.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.410
I made it into two dresses,

29:20.460 --> 29:24.740
so now... we can go into
town like twin sisters.

29:31.020 --> 29:34.130
Well,... I like it.

29:34.180 --> 29:36.100
Thank you.

29:58.220 --> 29:59.780
Oh.

30:02.340 --> 30:03.580
Larry, it's your mother!

30:06.100 --> 30:07.460
Wardrobe!

30:08.980 --> 30:10.540
Do I look like a jacket?

30:21.820 --> 30:23.330
Surprise!

30:23.380 --> 30:25.290
Oh, Larry!

30:25.340 --> 30:27.770
- I'm not good enough for your son?
- No, you're not.

30:27.820 --> 30:29.770
Let's not get all blamey and judgey.

30:29.820 --> 30:32.050
It's so obvious that she's using you.

30:32.100 --> 30:35.370
I could just as easily be using her.
Not that I am. That would be rude.

30:35.420 --> 30:36.930
She's twice your age!

30:36.980 --> 30:38.930
- Are you 15?
- No, I'm not 15!

30:38.980 --> 30:40.250
Not that age matters.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.130
You fell out with Nancy, and now this.

30:42.180 --> 30:44.650
That was different! I liked Nancy.

30:44.700 --> 30:47.930
And I... I didn't want to lose you.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.850
- Your mummy brings you food?
- I don't ask her for it.

30:50.900 --> 30:53.890
- She is dangerous, Larry.
- Yes, I am.

30:53.940 --> 30:56.690
- And what are you?
- I am a mother.

30:56.740 --> 31:00.340
Mmm, boring. I'm a woman.

31:02.180 --> 31:03.940
Your dress has a crack.

31:05.780 --> 31:06.940
Too tight.

31:08.820 --> 31:13.300
I will be, wear, and do as I wish.

31:14.620 --> 31:16.820
As you will find out.

31:36.700 --> 31:41.100
"I am a woman."... Sod off.

31:42.580 --> 31:45.050
Mum, Mr Kralefsky can't
teach me for a while.

31:45.100 --> 31:46.570
- Oh, yes, he can.
- No, really.

31:46.620 --> 31:49.730
- He's cracked a collarbone.
- No! How?

31:49.780 --> 31:53.090
He was demonstrating how he
wrestled with a brute and won a lady.

31:53.140 --> 31:54.970
I think he tends to exaggerate.

31:55.020 --> 31:57.580
And I sort of wrestled
him and won. Anyway, bye.

32:00.460 --> 32:05.170
Hello. I'm here for my session with
society photographer Leslie Durrell.

32:05.220 --> 32:07.170
Well, do come in.

32:07.220 --> 32:09.970
And to apologise for my fossil gaffe.

32:10.020 --> 32:12.380
My aim was to show eternal beauty.

32:14.700 --> 32:15.890
Theo, I can see you now.

32:15.940 --> 32:17.410
I've had a late cancellation.

32:17.460 --> 32:20.610
My model has cried off
due to a skin complaint,

32:20.660 --> 32:23.730
even though I told her
I needed the practice.

32:23.780 --> 32:27.380
- How was your journey, was
it OK? - Brilliant. - Lovely.

32:28.900 --> 32:31.290
Little boy, where is your mother?

32:31.340 --> 32:32.900
In the kitchen.

32:43.340 --> 32:45.020
Use your brain.

32:49.340 --> 32:51.740
- You have repaired your clothes. - Yes.

32:52.540 --> 32:54.570
Why are you trying to be what you are not?

32:54.620 --> 32:58.690
Since you're showing an interest,
I was bored with what I'd become.

32:58.740 --> 33:01.860
- I am never bored with me.
- No, I sensed that.

33:07.180 --> 33:08.850
Can I photograph you?

33:08.900 --> 33:11.820
- No, you can't. - No, I know,
but... - Thank you. - Yes, but...

33:12.900 --> 33:15.090
So, what can I do for you?

33:15.140 --> 33:17.330
You are angry I am with Larry.

33:17.380 --> 33:21.770
Oh, goodness no, I'm just pleased
Larry's finally found a girlfriend.

33:21.820 --> 33:24.090
I never thought that would happen.

33:24.140 --> 33:27.780
And an older woman too, perfect
for him to learn the ropes.

33:28.980 --> 33:32.090
- He is handsome.
- Mmm. Well, I'm pleased you think so.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.850
I mean that's all that matters.

33:33.900 --> 33:37.250
Well, I know how busy you
are, so why don't I give you

33:37.300 --> 33:41.940
this month's rent and...
then we can say our goodbyes.

33:46.340 --> 33:49.620
I'll give up your son,
if you give up Hugh.

34:24.239 --> 34:25.600
Hey, slow down there!

34:27.639 --> 34:28.760
Stop!

34:29.880 --> 34:31.320
Stop, please.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.750
I... I felt like an intruder.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.710
I would have introduced you.

34:37.760 --> 34:40.550
Look I-I can't move on with my life

34:40.600 --> 34:43.000
if I keep thinking that
it could've been with you.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.590
- Please don't keep me guessing.
- She is an old friend from Sweden.

34:47.639 --> 34:49.550
Rosalint.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.440
She's very bossy.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.639
And his name is Viggo.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.790
And I love him.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.840
I'm not fighting it any more.

35:02.240 --> 35:05.600
Our love is like... like buried treasure.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.630
Dig it up when nobody's looking,

35:08.680 --> 35:12.110
and then people come and
we have to hide it again.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.800
I'm so glad you've found someone.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.800
I will always love you, too.

35:19.560 --> 35:23.430
I don't want to mess up you and Huge.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.760
I think we'll be all right now.

35:28.480 --> 35:32.390
- And you know it's
Hugh, don't you? - Yeah.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.670
Oh, there's Viggo, he's
learning the accordion.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.520
Now I understand what you
mean about it being annoying.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.790
- Larry.
- Mmm?

35:51.160 --> 35:52.630
Come here.

35:52.680 --> 35:54.440
No, I'm working.

35:56.880 --> 35:59.270
- We are good together.
- Mmm.

35:59.320 --> 36:02.200
And in Greece...

36:03.360 --> 36:06.990
.. when a man and a woman are
good together, they get married.

36:09.720 --> 36:12.510
You're not exactly a blushing virgin.

36:12.560 --> 36:15.550
If you do ever get married,
I'd suggest a scarlet dress.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.630
Whatever you say, darling.

36:17.680 --> 36:20.030
I thought you'd see
marriage as rather bourgeois.

36:20.080 --> 36:23.470
You'll be telling me you've already
chosen your children's names next.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.240
Aristedes and Vasilia Junior.

36:29.560 --> 36:33.070
I shouldn't even be thinking
about her tawdry deal,

36:33.120 --> 36:35.880
- but I do so fear for Larry.
- Of course.

36:36.880 --> 36:39.870
And the ghost of Sven's making Hugh cross.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.430
Ah.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.070
I don't even know who I am any more.

36:47.120 --> 36:52.710
I want to be young,
but... I'd love serenity.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.910
I want to be more like you.

36:54.960 --> 36:58.200
No, no, please...

36:59.440 --> 37:01.080
.. be more like you.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.230
Hello, Gerrys, good morning!

37:11.280 --> 37:12.760
Give me a pelican!

37:17.000 --> 37:18.590
Give me an otter.

37:21.520 --> 37:25.550
- Oh, Mrs Durrells, I bring
you Mr Kralefskys. - Ah!

37:25.600 --> 37:27.910
He can't get out of the
car because it hurts.

37:27.960 --> 37:32.190
Oh, Mr Kralefsky, I am so
sorry about what happened.

37:32.240 --> 37:33.550
Gerry...

37:33.600 --> 37:36.910
They say that there is
no fool like an old fool

37:36.960 --> 37:39.790
and I am the living, hobbling proof.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.950
Oh. Well, thank you.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
How were Gerry's studies
going? His French?

37:46.120 --> 37:47.710
Well, you know, Mrs Durrell,

37:47.760 --> 37:50.470
[little by little, the
bird makes its nest.]

37:50.520 --> 37:54.350
Mm. Well, yes, I mean, we're
always saying that, aren't we?

37:54.400 --> 37:55.590
Yes.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.150
- So you'll have him back?
- No.

37:57.200 --> 38:00.990
- Tutoring is clearly too dangerous.
- Are you sure?

38:01.040 --> 38:03.830
It's impossible to find a good
tutor. Even Spiros had a go.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.510
Yes, I'm afraid so.

38:05.560 --> 38:08.670
Now, if you will excuse me,
I must go to see Mother.

38:08.720 --> 38:13.080
Oh, erm, well, it's an
outside one, I'm afraid.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.840
Er... Oh.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.310
They're ready, Mum. Look.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.880
Happy birthday.

38:50.160 --> 38:53.120
- Have I let you down?
- No, it's not you.

38:54.880 --> 38:56.840
I'm ghastly.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.950
This is what I've looked like recently?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.470
No.

39:05.440 --> 39:08.670
I think my experiments with looking
younger are over, don't you?

39:08.720 --> 39:10.720
Yes, please.

39:17.800 --> 39:21.550
- Leslie, darling, take
some more photographs. - Yes.

39:21.600 --> 39:26.320
God knows we're not perfect,
but... let's celebrate the real us.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.560
OK.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.720
Go that way. Go that way.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.600
Smile. Mouth closed. Lovely.

39:52.320 --> 39:53.680
Stop!

39:56.080 --> 39:57.840
Larry, Larry, Larry.

40:17.400 --> 40:19.680
Useless, isn't it? Margo.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.480
Beautiful. Really nice.

40:39.720 --> 40:41.040
Hello.

40:42.080 --> 40:43.150
Hello.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.630
I've, er, come to settle
my photography bill.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.190
Oh, thank you. Leslie's just...

40:47.240 --> 40:49.560
No, I haven't, I've come to see you.

40:51.160 --> 40:52.520
Happy birthday.

40:54.920 --> 40:58.150
I shouldn't have got involved
in your history with Sven.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.590
It's fine, it's all resolved.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.110
I'm sorry I was difficult.

41:03.160 --> 41:06.270
You're forgetting that my
last girlfriend was Vasilia.

41:06.320 --> 41:08.870
No, I'm not. She's seeing my son Larry.

41:08.920 --> 41:10.760
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

41:11.920 --> 41:15.040
She said she'd stop if
I stopped seeing you.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.190
The awful thing is, I thought about it.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.400
Please don't do that.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.070
Trust me, it won't last.

41:22.120 --> 41:25.190
- Mother, we've decided...
Oh, morning, Hugh. - Morning!

41:25.240 --> 41:28.190
We've decided to give your
birthday picnic another go.

41:28.240 --> 41:31.390
Oh. I got in a bit of a state
about the whole ageing thing.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.030
- Morning, Hugh.
- Gerry.

41:33.080 --> 41:36.110
Margo won't come out of her
room cos she's up to eight spots.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.030
What breakfast is flat
enough to slide under a door?

41:39.080 --> 41:40.800
- Bacon?
- Toast.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.990
- Kalimera.
- Donald!

41:44.040 --> 41:45.510
- Hey, pal.
- You're back!

41:45.560 --> 41:46.950
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.510
- What's in your rucksack?
- Can you help me get this off?

41:49.560 --> 41:53.510
I toppled over in Kefalonia and it
took me ten minutes to right myself.

41:53.560 --> 41:56.430
Um, where's Margo?

41:56.480 --> 41:58.070
She won't get out of her bedroom.

41:58.120 --> 42:00.600
So they're making her some flat breakfast.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.280
That should do it.

42:05.360 --> 42:08.230
- So Larry moved out?
- Yes.

42:08.280 --> 42:10.270
So you can stay until he gets back.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.150
- He's coming back?
- Oh, yes.

42:12.200 --> 42:15.270
So, why is Margo locked in her room?

42:15.320 --> 42:17.080
Let's ask her, shall we?

42:19.760 --> 42:20.870
Margo?

42:20.920 --> 42:23.550
Margo, tell Donald why you're hiding.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.950
I've got spots.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.400
She's there.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.960
- Hello, Margo.
- Hello, Donald.

42:33.360 --> 42:35.550
[I am stiff! Dear, oh dear!]

42:35.600 --> 42:37.510
Donald, have you got a job?

42:37.560 --> 42:40.150
No. I need one, actually,

42:40.200 --> 42:42.230
now that Max isn't paying for everything.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.560
Would you live in and be Gerry's tutor?

- What a lovely man.
- Yes, he is.

43:06.440 --> 43:08.350
Thank you.

43:08.400 --> 43:11.190
- Happy with life now?
- Oh, goodness, no.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.400
There's always far too
much to worry about.

43:14.560 --> 43:18.830
But you know I was thinking --
I've been fretting about my age,

43:18.880 --> 43:22.910
but Vasilia has taken a younger
man to feel better about herself.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.080
So, I win.

43:26.120 --> 43:27.360
Shall we?

43:42.240 --> 43:44.830
- Can I show you my photos?
- Mmm. Course.

43:44.880 --> 43:48.070
What would you say your, er, style is?

43:48.120 --> 43:50.470
- What's my style?
- Mmm.

43:50.520 --> 43:54.270
- I suppose you could describe it
as a "good style". - A good style.

43:54.320 --> 43:56.440
- Is that a style?
- It is now.

43:57.440 --> 43:59.950
- Can I photograph your
baby when it comes? - Yes.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.680
But not like that.

44:03.760 --> 44:05.670
I'm down to one major spot now,

44:05.720 --> 44:07.630
and these two which are like evil twins,

44:07.680 --> 44:09.550
but basically they're much better now.

44:09.600 --> 44:11.070
And that is, as I predicted,

44:11.120 --> 44:13.510
because you have the
adoration of a good man

44:13.560 --> 44:16.240
- soothing your raging hormones.
- I don't know.

44:17.520 --> 44:19.910
The one on my forehead,
which was really angry,

44:19.960 --> 44:22.110
- it's nearly gone now but it...
- Stop!

44:22.160 --> 44:24.310
That's ten minutes
talking about your spots.

44:24.360 --> 44:25.990
I am fiercely intelligent.

44:26.040 --> 44:28.550
- I've had a novel published.
- Oh, shut up.

44:28.600 --> 44:31.920
Anyway, I'm not talking to you now
you're seeing that hateful woman.

44:58.840 --> 45:00.230
OK, group photo, everyone.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.910
It's quite complicated so I
will need some discipline.

45:02.960 --> 45:05.670
- Come on, come on.
- Line up just here.

45:05.720 --> 45:07.120
Just check...

45:08.160 --> 45:10.830
So, Larry, what will it take

45:10.880 --> 45:13.910
to persuade you to come home
and change your girlfriend?

45:13.960 --> 45:17.030
- I'm afraid I'm my own person now.
- Mmm, no you're not.

45:17.080 --> 45:20.670
Not while you're living ten minutes
away from your mother by donkey.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.440
Let's see those smiles, everyone.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.270
I'll find you a nice girlfriend.

45:26.320 --> 45:28.030
I wouldn't if I were you.

45:28.080 --> 45:29.680
I'm getting married to Vasilia.

45:35.560 --> 45:38.310
The forecast says two
days of torrential rain.

45:38.360 --> 45:41.230
- I hate being shut up inside!
- Do my testicles look bigger?

45:41.280 --> 45:43.550
- No Larry, no.
- Everyone gets mumps.

45:43.600 --> 45:44.700
It's like a clown's name.

45:45.680 --> 45:47.390
This is Mrs Haddock.

45:47.440 --> 45:50.110
Why are there animals in the house?

45:50.160 --> 45:51.990
Mrs Haddock is a spiritualist.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.950
I've got an awful feeling about this.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.920
Your husband is reaching out for you.

45:57.840 --> 45:59.200
How did you do this?

46:00.305 --> 46:06.507
