But what if Matty sees it?

00:05.967 --> 00:07.767
Hey, Jenna, did you write
a super-detailed post

00:07.769 --> 00:09.187
about our relationship on Idea Bin?

00:09.195 --> 00:10.561
You had no right to do this.

00:10.586 --> 00:12.023
I'm sorry I thought we could be friends

00:12.031 --> 00:13.882

you haven't changed at all.

00:48.780 --> 00:49.913
Congrats, Jenna.

Jenna, have you seen the comments?

Tears plus 50 crying emojis.

00:55.306 --> 00:56.406

such a giant loser."

Don't bother the boss

This better be important.

01:10.162 --> 01:12.763
Uh, Lizzy, can I have a word with you?

01:12.765 --> 01:15.299
How about 75,000 words?

01:15.301 --> 01:16.133
Uh...

01:16.135 --> 01:18.168
Jenna, you did it.

01:18.170 --> 01:20.971
You took my profoundly
inspiring words to heart

01:20.973 --> 01:23.740
and your article got 300,000 hits.

01:23.742 --> 01:25.007
Right, about the art...

01:25.711 --> 01:27.544

01:27.546 --> 01:28.779
You wrote from the heart

01:28.781 --> 01:30.547
and do you know what that accomplished?

01:30.549 --> 01:33.116
Well, I know one thing it accomplished,

01:33.118 --> 01:34.818
which is why I was really hoping...

01:34.820 --> 01:36.453
Follow me, young protégé.

01:37.171 --> 01:38.755
Let's give it up for Jenna, everybody.

01:38.757 --> 01:40.724
She has done the impossible

01:40.726 --> 01:43.627
in the shortest amount of
time in Idea Bin history.

01:43.629 --> 01:45.729
She has connected with people

01:45.731 --> 01:47.698

01:47.700 --> 01:50.067

I'm the one getting the Idea Bin e-book?

02:06.852 --> 02:08.085
You have proven that people are

02:08.086 --> 02:10.387
interested in what you have to say.

02:10.389 --> 02:12.055
So think about what
you want to say next,

02:12.057 --> 02:15.273
because 300,000 people
might want to know.

02:17.132 --> 02:18.115

Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, slow down.

02:38.286 --> 02:39.578
Jenna, this is the
first time she's given

02:39.609 --> 02:41.320
an e-book to a summer
fellow, and it's you.

02:41.336 --> 02:44.537
Yeah, well, that's not
without its own problems.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.415
I'm thinking of asking Lizzy
to take the article down.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.418
What?

02:50.398 --> 02:51.344
Why?

02:51.346 --> 02:53.246
Matty's pissed.

02:53.248 --> 02:55.148
Wow, so this is about Matty.

02:55.150 --> 02:58.618
Matty is selfish if he
wants you to take it down.

02:58.620 --> 03:00.220
You're a writer, Jenna.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.856
You wrote about something
deeply personal and true.

03:02.858 --> 03:04.190
That's what good writers do.

03:04.192 --> 03:06.092
Seriously, this is a huge opportunity.

03:06.094 --> 03:07.494
I'm not letting you blow it.

03:07.867 --> 03:10.015
I swore to Lizzy you'd ace this.

me for my 10:30 cup of cappu.

03:19.695 --> 03:21.015
Yeah, totally. Go.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.176
- Patrick is such a Princeton Charming.

He's gonna take me on
a sunset sailboat ride

03:24.712 --> 03:27.090

03:27.115 --> 03:28.248
Hi. What?

03:28.250 --> 03:29.549
You're on Planet Smartphone

Lissa doesn't want me
to come by the house

04:07.222 --> 04:10.123
and confuse baby Morgan, which I get.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.158
She gurgled something
that sounded an awful lot

04:12.160 --> 04:14.027

No, I haven't read your article yet.

04:22.838 --> 04:24.370
Yeah, Matty's still pissed.

04:24.372 --> 04:26.806

you were taking it down.

the Horse Lover's Spirit"

- This is Jake. He works there.
- Manages.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.968
You got a summer job in management?

04:54.970 --> 04:56.069
It's not a summer job.

04:56.071 --> 04:57.237
I started in the fall

04:57.239 --> 04:58.304

so you're not in school?

Maybe ask some questions.

05:30.739 --> 05:32.639
- Get some pictures.
- Why don't you come by the club

05:32.641 --> 05:34.374

Ugh, Matty, finally. You're so late.

05:48.190 --> 05:50.290
I don't know if I'm
really up to the whole

05:50.292 --> 05:52.258
conversation stuff today.

05:52.260 --> 05:53.893
Matty, I know it's summer

05:53.895 --> 05:56.229
and it's time to raise
the roof or whatever,

05:56.231 --> 05:57.564
but if you want to succeed,

05:57.566 --> 05:59.833
you have to put in the work, like Jenna.

05:59.835 --> 06:01.868
Did she tell you she's getting an e-book?

06:01.870 --> 06:03.369
I'm so proud of her.

06:03.371 --> 06:05.071
Have you read any of her stuff?

06:05.073 --> 06:06.206
Yeah, I have.

06:10.144 --> 06:13.146
You proud now?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.533
Sorry, I just...

06:33.535 --> 06:35.468
I promised him I would
get this article taken down

06:35.470 --> 06:37.003
but I haven't yet.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.338
And you're not going to.

06:38.340 --> 06:39.572
And for what it's worth,

06:39.574 --> 06:41.274
your slightly harsh assessments

06:41.276 --> 06:42.508
were pretty valid.

06:42.510 --> 06:44.777
Hey, I was just as harsh on myself.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.179
Yeah, I guess.

06:46.181 --> 06:48.131
Well, what about the paragraph

06:48.156 --> 06:51.017
I wrote on my flaws
and my insensitivities?

06:51.019 --> 06:52.385
College giving me a false

06:52.387 --> 06:53.623

07:06.694 --> 07:08.268
No wonder Matty's so pissed.

07:08.270 --> 07:09.435
I'm pissed too.

07:09.437 --> 07:10.530
Cutting out that section

07:10.555 --> 07:12.491
changes the entire article into one

07:12.516 --> 07:14.618
long, negative rant about Matty.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.076
Is this how Idea Bin gets its hits?

on the front page.

ever have his feelings hurt.

07:45.030 --> 07:46.295
It's also not what I wrote.

07:46.297 --> 07:48.031
Ethan took out the entire heart of

07:48.033 --> 07:49.732
my article. I'm gonna go
give him a piece of my mind

07:49.734 --> 07:51.034

Oh, no, that is not
a good Idea Bin idea.

07:53.219 --> 07:55.147
- Why not?
- Because of all the buzz

07:55.171 --> 07:57.271
the piece is getting and
then it just disappears?

07:57.273 --> 07:58.467
People will wonder why.

07:58.507 --> 08:00.607
They'll think there's
some nasty backstory.

08:00.609 --> 08:01.941
It'll end up getting more attention.

08:01.943 --> 08:03.243
What do I do?

08:03.245 --> 08:05.445
Luke put himself out on
the line for me with Lizzy,

08:05.447 --> 08:07.080

Basically, I'm in charge of everything.

08:40.543 --> 08:41.803

08:41.828 --> 08:45.289

Do I know you from somewhere?

09:08.771 --> 09:10.270
Nope, I don't think so.

You're Mark.

09:12.288 --> 09:13.440
From Jenna's article.

Someone posted a picture of
you in the comment section.

09:16.012 --> 09:17.011
I am such a fan.

09:17.013 --> 09:18.946
Oh, great, I have fans.

09:18.948 --> 09:20.147
Dude, I finally took a peek.

09:23.052 --> 09:24.551

09:24.553 --> 09:25.786

09:25.788 --> 09:28.155
This is amazing.

I'm so sorry about that.

my customers like that.

in a more timely fashion,

09:54.190 --> 09:56.791

to emergency protocols.

09:58.762 --> 10:01.177
Since you reintroduced
your P to my V. Duh.

You told me before

10:03.500 --> 10:04.699

10:04.701 --> 10:05.800
Well, now I'm back.

10:05.802 --> 10:08.069
So you can tie me down all you want.

10:27.123 --> 10:28.790

10:28.792 --> 10:29.764
The article you said you were gonna

10:31.227 --> 10:33.261
Well, yes, part of it is still up.

What are you talking about?
The whole thing is still up.

10:35.432 --> 10:37.265
That's just it. The
whole thing was never up.

10:37.267 --> 10:39.000
They butchered it without asking me.

10:39.002 --> 10:40.911

- Matty, please believe me.

10:40.936 --> 10:42.708

10:54.116 --> 10:56.384
Huh? Oh, wait, the boring half?

10:56.386 --> 10:57.885
Hon, I did you a favor.

10:57.887 --> 10:59.921
Without my intervention,
your article was just another

11:03.660 --> 11:05.359
Our readers crave a point of view.

11:05.361 --> 11:07.228
Okay, I don't want
to come off as a brat,

11:07.230 --> 11:09.797
and I'm happy to have
had something go viral,

11:09.799 --> 11:12.133
but I want my piece
reposted in its entirety.

11:12.135 --> 11:14.661
Jenna, let me just save you
from yourself here, okay?

11:14.686 --> 11:16.904
Every good writer draws
on personal experience

11:16.906 --> 11:19.207
and sometimes we struggle
with offending some people

11:19.209 --> 11:21.591
from point to point, but if viral views

11:21.616 --> 11:22.473
are what you're going for,

11:22.490 --> 11:23.825
brutal honesty is the best policy.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.089
Honesty would be representing

11:25.091 --> 11:26.157
both sides of the breakup.

11:26.159 --> 11:27.291
Oh, grow up.

11:27.292 --> 11:28.592
The audience for your little

11:28.594 --> 11:31.628
apologist paragraph is
exactly one... your ex.

11:31.630 --> 11:33.902
Not exactly the demo
we're courting, hon.

11:34.701 --> 11:37.068
Oh, and, hon, I wouldn't
go to Lizzy with this.

11:37.070 --> 11:39.170
She has no patience
for this sort of thing.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.722
Trust me, if you walk through that door,

11:41.747 --> 11:42.874
it is not gonna end well.

11:42.876 --> 11:45.911
There has never been a summer
where a fellow didn't disappear.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.979
Do you want to be the one, hon?

11:55.713 --> 11:57.113
Read the article about Matty.

11:57.642 --> 11:59.600
A little cruel, don't you think?

11:59.978 --> 12:02.306
I was just trying to
write something honest

12:02.341 --> 12:03.916
which is what good writers do.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.824
So good writers sell out
their friends to get e-books?

12:06.826 --> 12:08.462
I wasn't trying to sell anyone out.

12:08.487 --> 12:09.920
I was just trying to write the truth.

12:09.922 --> 12:11.021
It's not my fault that they left...

12:11.023 --> 12:12.188
Reminds me of a certain letter

12:12.190 --> 12:14.391
I once wrote to you.

12:14.393 --> 12:16.793
- That was actually cruel.
- It was.

12:16.795 --> 12:18.490
I called you a pussy.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.469
"He didn't have the
guts to do it himself,

12:20.494 --> 12:21.765
so I had to do it for him."

12:21.767 --> 12:24.000
It kind of sounds like
you're calling him a pussy.

12:24.002 --> 12:25.869
I called myself a pussy too, okay?

12:25.871 --> 12:27.070
But they won't publish that part.

12:27.072 --> 12:28.376
That's the real problem here.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.215
As awful as that letter was

12:31.217 --> 12:33.284
I wrote to you, it was private.

12:33.285 --> 12:35.118
You told Matty's truth
to the whole world

12:35.120 --> 12:36.486
and that, Jenna,

12:36.488 --> 12:38.380
that's the real problem.

12:38.885 --> 12:41.469
<i>I convinced myself that I
was just being a good writer</i>

12:41.494 --> 12:43.761

light of my mom's words,</i>

What's the problem?

12:57.744 --> 12:59.710
I... I need more.

12:59.712 --> 13:00.878
Oh, I will give you more.

13:00.880 --> 13:01.946
No, you know what I mean.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.347
We keep doing the same thing.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.716
I'm not doing butt, Sergio.

13:05.718 --> 13:06.951
I'm serious.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.087
You know what, I want more than sex.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.957
You know, I want closeness, you know?

13:12.959 --> 13:15.893
Like emotional intimacy.

13:15.895 --> 13:18.262
Emotional intimacy?

13:18.264 --> 13:19.930
You make chalupas.

13:19.932 --> 13:21.499
Good one, Sadita.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.434
Deflect an honest attempt
to have a conversation

13:23.436 --> 13:25.703
with an insult to my
heritage and my line of work.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.099
You're so predictable.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.475
That was unpredictable.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.579
It was amazing.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.256

want me to leave.

13:49.629 --> 13:53.431
Well, I'm, uh... not like other guys.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.099
You're not like other guys.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.168

don't know what they want

13:57.170 --> 13:59.403
but you already have what you want.

13:59.405 --> 14:01.105
You're satisfied with working here.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.273
You don't need anything better.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.141
You don't care about big money

14:04.143 --> 14:05.543
or higher education,

14:05.545 --> 14:07.545
and you're completely content

14:07.547 --> 14:10.047
to live in your
hometown your whole life.

14:12.718 --> 14:14.985
[chuckles nervously]

14:15.760 --> 14:18.122
So I guess since both my mom
and dad basically abandoned me

14:18.124 --> 14:19.623
that's why I never get close to anyone.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.325
Wow, what a breakthrough.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.160
You don't think I already know all that?

14:23.162 --> 14:25.229
It's why you're so rude.

14:25.231 --> 14:27.998
I'm sorry, but I don't
know what you want from me.

14:28.674 --> 14:30.434
I want you to let me in.

14:30.436 --> 14:33.071
I let you in every time I see you.

up where you left off.

It doesn't work for me anymore.

Look, what you and I went through,

17:05.124 --> 17:06.557
a lot of people go through

17:06.559 --> 17:09.527
and I was just trying
to use us as an example

17:09.529 --> 17:11.662
of universal experience.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.097
And I'm sure that the people

17:13.098 --> 17:15.332
who read that article will understand.

17:15.334 --> 17:16.534
Well, I don't care what all those

17:16.536 --> 17:17.768
other people think of me, Jenna.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.170
I care what you think of me.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.071
And now that I've read
your article, I know.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.673
You think I'm a loser

17:23.343 --> 17:25.576
and you didn't even have the
guts to say it to my face.

17:26.007 --> 17:27.678
Would you please just
read the whole thing?

17:27.680 --> 17:29.914
I'm done reading. I'm
done talking about this

17:29.916 --> 17:32.138

Can we go now?

17:50.052 --> 17:51.585

Luke, I'm sorry.

It's just... it's
something I have to do.
