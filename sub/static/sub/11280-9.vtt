CHRIS ROCK:
As a kid, I wasn't
superstitious,

00:09.077 --> 00:11.145
but everybody in my family was.

00:11.179 --> 00:12.446
If my mother spilled salt,

00:12.480 --> 00:14.582
she would always
throw some over her shoulder

00:14.615 --> 00:16.650
for good luck.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.519
No!

00:20.821 --> 00:22.823
That's nine cents' worth
of salt.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.793
Drew wouldn't walk under
a ladder, no matter what.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.561
Sonny! Help me!

00:27.595 --> 00:29.697
I've fallen and I can't get up!

00:29.730 --> 00:32.200
You want me to help you,
you're going to have to crawl

00:32.233 --> 00:33.801
from underneath
this ladder first.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.836
And Tonya believed that,
if she stepped on a crack,

00:35.869 --> 00:37.671
she'd break my mother's back.

00:37.705 --> 00:38.806
No!

00:38.839 --> 00:41.475
Oh! Oh!

00:47.181 --> 00:50.151
I wasn't superstitious,
but I did believe in bad luck.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.389
Mom, I need some socks.

00:55.423 --> 00:58.692
Julius, give Chris a pair
of your socks, please.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.794
* You must be my lucky star

01:00.828 --> 01:05.099
* 'Cause you make the darkness
seem so far *

01:05.133 --> 01:06.800
These the only pair
of socks you got?

01:06.834 --> 01:08.436
Yeah.

01:08.469 --> 01:11.172
Besides,
those are my lucky socks.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.141
I was wearing
those socks

01:13.174 --> 01:14.742
the night
I met your mother.

01:14.775 --> 01:19.413
Girl, he's cute,
but look at those socks!

01:25.219 --> 01:27.155
I didn't think
my father's lucky socks

01:27.188 --> 01:29.123
would make a difference.

01:29.157 --> 01:32.560
Hey, lil' dude
from across the street!

01:32.593 --> 01:33.894
I just hit the numbers.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.229
Want to hold a dollar?

01:35.263 --> 01:37.198
Yeah. Thanks.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.233
That's all you.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.868
They not only
made a difference,

01:40.901 --> 01:43.237
they made a dollar.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.914
* Ohh... make it funky now!

01:53.947 --> 01:57.918

02:15.636 --> 02:17.671
I believed in good luck.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.841
I just never believed
it could happen to me.

02:20.874 --> 02:24.278
Man, I'm sorry.
I forgot my bus pass.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.414
It's all right, man. I know you.

02:26.447 --> 02:29.350
For real? Thanks.

02:29.383 --> 02:33.521
On the second bus,
I got even luckier.

02:33.554 --> 02:36.224
Hi. I'm Darlene.
What's your name?

02:36.257 --> 02:37.791
I'm Chris.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.560
That's one of my
favorite names.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.695
That's not even
my favorite name.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.964
I was even getting lucky
at school.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.566
Take that,
Mr. Miyagi!

02:45.599 --> 02:46.967
Oh. Hey, Chris.

02:47.000 --> 02:47.968
Want to smack this kid?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.270
No, I'm okay.

02:49.303 --> 02:53.974
This kid needs a pair
of lucky socks and a gun.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.910
Things were going so good,
I almost felt white.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.946
Chris, I bought you something.

02:58.979 --> 03:02.383
It's a copy
of Roots 4: Kunta's Revenge.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.285
It's not even out yet.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.554
Thanks.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.256
Roots 4 was good,

03:08.289 --> 03:11.225
but my favorite was Roots 6:
Hitler Strikes Back.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.728
Even though we were poor,

03:14.762 --> 03:16.997
it didn't stop us
from asking for stuff.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.768
Mama, can I have pink carpet
in my bedroom?

03:20.801 --> 03:23.737
Pink carpet?
What you need pink carpet for?

03:23.771 --> 03:26.507
Well, because Billy Ocean
has pink carpet in his bedroom.

03:26.540 --> 03:30.478
Along with a baby giraffe,
a disco ball and three midgets.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.580
Well, as soon
as you get a hit record,

03:32.613 --> 03:34.582
you can have
any color carpet you want.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.884
But, just because
we asked for stuff,

03:36.917 --> 03:38.051
it didn't mean we'd get it.

03:38.085 --> 03:41.722
:
* Candy girl,
you are my world... *

03:41.755 --> 03:43.357
Holy Ralph Tresvant!

03:43.391 --> 03:45.293
* You're so sweet...

03:45.326 --> 03:47.461
Hey, man,
what you doing?

03:47.495 --> 03:50.030
Just getting ready
for the school talent show.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.534
Oh, I'm going to need a suit.
You gonna make some money
in that talent show?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.035
What you need
a new suit for?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.271
So I can pop my collar up
while I'm performing.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.006
You know how much
a new suit costs?

03:59.039 --> 04:00.874
I'm not going to
spend money on a suit

04:00.908 --> 04:02.009
just so you can
break the collar.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.877
You want to
pop something,

04:03.911 --> 04:06.447
pop open a pen,
and fill out a
job application.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.716
Then you can buy all
the suits you want.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.622
Some guys have all the luck,
and today that guy was me.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.290
Chris, how was
your day, baby?

04:16.324 --> 04:17.358
It was strange.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.527
It was, like, one
of the greatest days of my life.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.661
Why

04:20.694 --> 04:21.662
Nothing.

04:21.695 --> 04:22.963
Nobody beat you up?

04:22.996 --> 04:24.332
Nope.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.299
Nobody rapped you?

04:25.333 --> 04:26.334
Nope.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.200
Well, how was school?

04:27.234 --> 04:29.670
It was good. I got a "B"
on my math quiz.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.605
Oh...
Starting to think these
socks really are lucky.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.674
Okay, well,
Mr. Lucky Socks,
go wash your hands.

04:33.707 --> 04:34.842
Dinner's ready.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.377
What are we having?

04:36.410 --> 04:37.711
My favorite meal was meat loaf,

04:37.745 --> 04:40.013
mashed potatoes
and peach cobbler.

04:40.047 --> 04:43.384
Meat loaf,
mashed potatoes
and peach cobbler.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.596
What's wrong with you?

04:55.629 --> 04:59.733
I asked Mama for pink carpet,
and she said no.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.335
Why did you ask her?

05:01.369 --> 05:02.970
You know Dad's the one
that spoils you.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.905
You think
he'd give me pink carpet?

05:04.938 --> 05:07.375
Yeah. He never says no to you.

05:07.408 --> 05:10.077
But I asked him for a suit,
and he said no.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.413
You asked
him already?
Yeah.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.581
You should have asked Mama.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.749
You know she don't
like looking raggedy.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.050
That was the moment
Drew discovered

05:17.084 --> 05:19.052
the oldest parent trick
in the book.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.722
When one parent says no,
just ask the other one.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.992
You know what? I got an idea.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.127
The next day,
my socks were still holding up,

05:27.160 --> 05:28.896
and so was my luck.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.431
Look, there's no such
thing as lucky socks.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.600
That's like believing
in four-leaf clovers,

05:32.633 --> 05:34.468
shooting stars
or Michael Landon.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.470
Well, how do
you explain all
this lucky stuff

05:36.504 --> 05:37.971
that's been
happening to me?
It's probability.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.673
It's just the number of times
an event can happen

05:39.707 --> 05:41.909
divided by the total number
of possible outcomes.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.076
Hi, Chris.

05:43.110 --> 05:46.013
If they were miracle socks,
I would have had a shot,

05:46.046 --> 05:48.115
but they were
only lucky socks,

05:48.148 --> 05:49.783
so I just got a smile.

05:49.817 --> 05:54.154
I don't care what you
say-- the socks work.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.890
If O.J. Simpson
had been wearing these socks,

05:56.924 --> 05:59.660
he'd be covering
football games now.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.996
Okay, don't forget to study
for your history test on Monday.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.698
It'll be on people in history

06:04.732 --> 06:08.469
who have achieved their goals
against all odds.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.970
So, you want to study
after school?

06:10.003 --> 06:11.439
I don't need to study.

06:11.472 --> 06:12.873
I got my lucky socks.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.409
Drew's plan was simple:

06:15.443 --> 06:17.177
Act like this
was the first time

06:17.210 --> 06:18.679
they had asked
for what they wanted.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.147
Like the no's never happened.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.915
Hey, Daddy.
Hey.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.884
Can I get pink
carpet for my room?

06:23.917 --> 06:25.152
What do you need carpet for?

06:25.185 --> 06:28.622
Because Billy Ocean
has pink carpet,
and you know how much

06:28.656 --> 06:31.191
I love Billy Ocean.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.494
I'll tell you what.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.629
We'll go look for some
pink carpet tomorrow.

06:35.663 --> 06:36.997
Thank you, Daddy.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.479
One down, one to go.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.652
Hey, Mom, can I get
a new suit for the
school talent show?

06:58.686 --> 07:01.154
Not unless your talent
is wearing a suit.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.524
But I'm performing "Candy
Girl", by New Edition,

07:03.557 --> 07:05.493
and the whole school
is going to be there.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.528
Drew could do a lot of things,

07:07.561 --> 07:09.663
but my mother knew
singing wasn't one of them.

07:09.697 --> 07:13.200
Oh, well, that..
That... that's nice, baby.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.570
So can I get a new suit?

07:16.604 --> 07:18.472
I don't want
to look raggedy.

07:18.506 --> 07:23.577
Raggedy? Oh, my baby
is not going to look raggedy.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.178
When I finish this,
we'll go shopping.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.580
Okay. Thanks, Mom.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.048
You're welcome, baby.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.484
:
Singing...

07:33.286 --> 07:36.557
That night,
even my dreams were lucky.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.232
Whoa! Calm down! Calm down.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.135
You scared the heck out of me.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.237
Listen,
I'm just looking for the woods.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.239
Wait.
You're not going to kill me?

07:52.272 --> 07:54.074
Why would I do that?

07:54.107 --> 07:56.276
Okay, you go downstairs,
make a left.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.711
Go down the corner,
make another left,

07:57.745 --> 07:59.780
and there should be a park
about a mile away.

07:59.813 --> 08:04.217
Thanks. Hey, by the way,
you know the date?

08:04.251 --> 08:06.286
Thursday the 12th.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.487
Thanks.

08:07.521 --> 08:11.024
Later, I had one of those
dreams where I was falling

08:11.058 --> 08:12.893
and Jennifer Beals caught me.

08:24.204 --> 08:27.307
Where are my lucky socks?
Who took my lucky socks?

08:27.340 --> 08:29.142
Wasn't me.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.845
Those socks were stinking
up this whole room.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.213
I got them
things out of here.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.583
You're lucky you
didn't die from the smell.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.784
Ugh!

08:36.817 --> 08:38.852
Hey, that was lucky funk!

08:43.323 --> 08:45.225
After my mother got rid of
my socks,

08:45.258 --> 08:47.294
I imagined whoever was
wearing them

08:47.327 --> 08:49.663
was having a lot
better luck than me.

08:49.697 --> 08:52.566
* Let the good times roll

08:58.872 --> 09:03.611
* Let the good times roll

09:03.644 --> 09:04.745
We are all out of soup.

09:04.778 --> 09:05.813
Ohh...

09:05.846 --> 09:06.980
You got any whiskey?

09:07.014 --> 09:09.216
This is your lucky day.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.721
Sure glad y'all ran out of food.

09:18.258 --> 09:22.062
My husband just died
of a heart attack!

09:22.095 --> 09:23.731
Tragic!

09:23.764 --> 09:28.636
Well, since he's dead,
want to go out to dinner?

09:28.669 --> 09:29.803
I could eat.

09:29.837 --> 09:32.706
* Let the good times roll
Without my lucky socks,

09:32.740 --> 09:34.374
I probably should have studied
for that test.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.343
But that seemed a lot harder
than finding more luck.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.811
How much for just the foot?

09:37.845 --> 09:40.948
* Let the good times roll...

09:40.981 --> 09:44.151
What the hell makes you think
I'm a leprechaun?

09:44.184 --> 09:46.386
Let me go! No!

09:46.419 --> 09:50.223
:
Oh, Louise! I'm sorry!

09:50.257 --> 09:52.726
Hey, man, can I have one of
these horseshoes?

09:53.827 --> 09:57.097
Tonya and Drew thought
they had pulled it off.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.032
Then the "it" hit the fan.

09:59.066 --> 10:02.670
Tonya, why are you
moving furniture?

10:02.703 --> 10:05.873
Because Daddy's giving me
pink carpet.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.108
Julius!

10:12.012 --> 10:15.716
*

10:15.749 --> 10:16.684
Drew.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.886
Where'd you get
that suit?

10:18.919 --> 10:20.688
The Peach Suit Warehouse.
Mama bought it for me.

10:20.721 --> 10:24.291
That's $63.72 worth of suit.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.793
Rochelle!

10:29.062 --> 10:32.199
I told Tonya she couldn't
have pink carpet.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.835
Why would you say yes
when I said no?

10:34.868 --> 10:36.336
I didn't know
she asked you first.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.005
But what I want to know is, why

10:38.038 --> 10:40.674
you spent money
on a suit for Drew
after I told him no?

10:40.708 --> 10:43.410
Well, if you had asked me, I
would have told you it was okay.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.045
Wait a minute.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.314
So when you say
something's okay,
it's okay,

10:47.347 --> 10:49.116
but when I say something's
okay, it's not?!

10:49.149 --> 10:51.051
Sure.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.353
What kind of sense
does that make?

10:53.386 --> 10:56.089
It makes
perfect sense.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.425
And besides, I am not going
to have my baby on stage

10:58.458 --> 10:59.526
looking like
he can't sing.

10:59.559 --> 11:00.660
Well, I'm not going to have
my baby walking around

11:00.694 --> 11:03.096
acting like she can't have
pink carpet on the floor.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.932
ROCHELLE:
You know what? Fine.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.000
Fine.
Fine.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.102
Ain't nobody
worried about you.
Ain't worried about you either.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.137
Drew's plan was still working.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.039
My parents were so busy
fighting each other

11:12.072 --> 11:14.441
they forgot Tonya and Drew
should be the ones in trouble.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.476
It's too bad they didn't
hear the rest

11:16.509 --> 11:18.111
of that conversation.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.480
Wait, wait, wait a minute,

11:20.513 --> 11:22.149
Julius.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.251
I think we just been had.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.953
What are you talking about?

11:25.986 --> 11:29.422
Your kids just played us
against each other.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.193
Ain't this about a...

11:33.226 --> 11:35.128
Before you get mad,

11:35.162 --> 11:37.297
let's think about
this for a minute.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.466
So whenever they ask
us for something,

11:39.499 --> 11:41.068
let's come up
with a system.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.335
What kind of system?

11:42.369 --> 11:43.904
This was their system.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.206
Daddy, can I have a popsicle?

11:46.239 --> 11:47.340
Go ask your mother.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.143
Hey, Dad, can I have a dollar?

11:50.177 --> 11:52.012
Go ask your mother.

11:52.045 --> 11:55.215
Dad, can I go to the hospital?

11:55.248 --> 11:57.150
Go ask your mother.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.319
Okay?

11:59.352 --> 12:00.287
Okay.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.056
That's my baby.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.858
Without my lucky socks

12:04.892 --> 12:06.794
I knew any chance
of me doing good

12:06.827 --> 12:08.862
on that test was history.

12:08.896 --> 12:09.897
Hey, man,

12:09.930 --> 12:11.098
what's the matter?

12:11.131 --> 12:13.767
I lost your lucky socks.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.938
Chris...

12:17.971 --> 12:20.908
those socks aren't lucky.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.243
If they were lucky,
I'd still have my hair,

12:23.276 --> 12:25.012
I would have hit the number

12:25.045 --> 12:27.280
and I wouldn't still be wearing
a pair of socks

12:27.314 --> 12:29.182
I had when I met your mother.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.919
But I have a lot
of big stuff going on
in school tomorrow.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.887
I need those socks.

12:33.921 --> 12:38.291
Chris... you need to make
your own luck in this world.

12:38.325 --> 12:42.129
Success comes from opportunity
and preparation.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.864
And being white.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.566
Do you think it was luck
when Rocky beat Mr. T?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.535
Do you think the Ghostbusters
were lucky

12:48.568 --> 12:51.338
when they saved New York from
the Stay

12:51.371 --> 12:53.106
Do you think Godzilla was lucky

12:53.140 --> 12:55.042
when he beat Ghidrah
the three

12:55.075 --> 12:57.577
I don't know.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.946
I guess not.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.081
That's right.

13:03.350 --> 13:07.120
Chris, the only thing lucky
about those socks

13:07.154 --> 13:09.923
is that I couldn't find
the matching pants.

13:09.957 --> 13:13.160
Now go find your own luck.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.962
You don't need
those socks.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.163
Thanks.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.898
You're welcome.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.503
Talking to my father
always made me feel better.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.038
And maybe he was right.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.407
Maybe it wasn't
the socks after all.

13:29.877 --> 13:32.012
Wrong.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.589
Looks kind of crooked.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.226
That's better.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.260
Love it.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.261
That's my girl.
Come here.

13:48.295 --> 13:52.132
Look, Tonya, next time
me or your mother say no,

13:52.165 --> 13:54.201
we mean no, got it?

13:54.234 --> 13:55.936
Yes, Daddy.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.204
Good.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.106
Meanwhile, my mother had
another way

13:59.139 --> 14:00.273
of getting her point across.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.609
The next time you ask
me to do something

14:02.642 --> 14:03.877
after your father
told you no,

14:03.911 --> 14:07.014
I'm going to pop
the pores off your
face, do you understand me?

14:07.047 --> 14:08.181
Yes, ma'am.

14:08.215 --> 14:12.485
As for me, I was still as lucky
as a three-leaf clover.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.922
Hey, man, I forgot
my bus pass again.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.189
Can I just go ahead?

14:16.223 --> 14:17.257
Yeah, you can just go ahead.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.160
You can just go ahead and jog
alongside the bus.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.263
Go on, go on.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.564
Kids.

14:24.597 --> 14:27.534
On the second bus,
my luck got worse.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.236
Hi, Darlene.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.570
Who are you?

14:30.603 --> 14:32.940
I'm... Chris. Remember?

14:32.973 --> 14:35.208
You said you
liked my name.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.043
I really don't care.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.345
Who the hell do you
think you are?

14:38.378 --> 14:40.080
Just because somebody
sits down, doesn't mean

14:40.113 --> 14:41.314
you have to start
talking to them.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.083
Do I look like
I want to talk?

14:43.116 --> 14:45.152
And what the hell kind
of name is Chris anyway?

14:45.185 --> 14:47.320
What you need to do,
is you need to sit down,

14:47.354 --> 14:49.622
shut up and ride the bus
to wherever you got to go.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.292
And back at school...

14:55.162 --> 15:00.133
I hope everyone is prepared
for today's history quiz.

15:00.167 --> 15:04.337
And, Chris, I hope you weren't
too busy taking care

15:04.371 --> 15:06.673
of all of your half-brothers
and sisters

15:06.706 --> 15:08.375
to study.

15:11.178 --> 15:12.312
What's wrong?

15:12.345 --> 15:14.647
I didn't study and I lost
my lucky socks.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.149
Dude, you're toast.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.150
No, I'm not.

15:17.184 --> 15:19.719
Toast would get a better grade
on this quiz.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.323
But today we're going to do
something a little differently.

15:23.356 --> 15:27.494
Instead of a written exam,
it's going to be an oral exam.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.528
Chris...

15:28.561 --> 15:30.998
you're so very
well-spoken.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.499
Why don't you go first?

15:32.532 --> 15:34.334
Come up here
in front of the class.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.469
I didn't have my lucky socks,

15:36.503 --> 15:39.072
and now I needed a new pair
of lucky underwear.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.141
Well, what did you want me
to talk about?

15:41.174 --> 15:43.410
I want you to talk about
people in history

15:43.443 --> 15:45.712
who have achieved their goals

15:45.745 --> 15:47.480
against all odds.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.550
Do you know what
goals are, Chris?

15:50.583 --> 15:52.185
Yeah.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.686
I had no idea what to say.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.390
Without my lucky socks
and without studying

15:57.424 --> 16:00.227
I was in big, big trouble.

16:00.260 --> 16:03.330
Um, many people think
that when you succeed

16:03.363 --> 16:07.334
against all odds...
it's by luck.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.236
Well, I don't
believe in luck.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.371
At least not anymore.

16:13.373 --> 16:17.377
I mean, was... was it lucky...
was it lucky when...

16:17.410 --> 16:19.579
when Rocky beat Mr. T?

16:19.612 --> 16:21.681
No, he prepared for it.

16:21.714 --> 16:25.185
He prepared by beating
Apollo Creed.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.386
So now who

16:26.419 --> 16:28.288
pities the fool?

16:28.321 --> 16:31.458
Was it lucky when
Indiana Jones

16:31.491 --> 16:33.793
saved those kids
from the Temple of Doom?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.128
No,

16:35.162 --> 16:36.396
he prepared.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.299
He prepared by saving the world
in Raiders of the Lost Ark.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.568
I mean, if you could save
the whole world,

16:41.601 --> 16:45.372
it's not going to be too hard
to save a couple of kids.

16:45.405 --> 16:49.309
Was it lucky when King Kong
defeated those planes?

16:49.342 --> 16:51.678
No, 'cause he didn't defeat
the planes.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.681
They shot his behind clear off
the Empire State Building.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.317
Now if King Kong had spent
some time

16:57.350 --> 16:58.685
learning how to fight
some planes

16:58.718 --> 17:00.553
instead of chasing
a little white girl around,

17:00.587 --> 17:03.523
he would be alive
to this very day.

17:05.092 --> 17:09.096
Many people believe that you
can succeed against all odds.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.563
I don't believe that.

17:10.597 --> 17:14.267
I believe the odds are,
that if you don't prepare,

17:14.301 --> 17:15.835
you won't succeed.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.270
Yes!

17:17.304 --> 17:19.272
Yes! Yes!

17:23.410 --> 17:25.445
It turns out I didn't need
lucky socks.

17:25.478 --> 17:29.082
All I needed
was to listen to my father.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.420
The Lord had answered
my prayers,

17:33.453 --> 17:35.522
and my mother was praying
he would answer hers.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.129
TEACHER:
That was lovely,
Christina.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.364
Okay, our next
performer

17:44.397 --> 17:46.299
is someone who is

17:46.333 --> 17:48.468
very popular here
at Dolemite Elementary.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.403
First there was Cher,

17:50.437 --> 17:54.407
then there was Madonna, Sting,
and Rockwell...

17:54.441 --> 17:56.643
Ladies and gentlemen,
I bring you Drew!

17:56.676 --> 17:59.146
Oh, that's my boy!
That's my baby!

17:59.179 --> 18:00.447
Yeah!
That's my baby.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.415
JULIUS:
Oh, you look good.
Look at my boy!

18:02.449 --> 18:05.485
Look at the little girls.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.320
(New Edition's
"Candy Girl" plays)

18:07.354 --> 18:10.590
Drew couldn't sing, but he
lip-synched like an angel.

18:10.623 --> 18:11.891
* Candy girl

18:11.924 --> 18:13.660
* All I want to say

18:13.693 --> 18:18.331
* When you're with me
you brighten up my day *

18:19.899 --> 18:21.634
Ma, look, he's lip-synching.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.504
I know, isn't it great?
Thank God.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.507
* When I'm with you,
you make me feel so good *

18:27.540 --> 18:29.742
* Through and through

18:29.776 --> 18:33.213
* The way you walk
Go ahead, girl, you can go
up there, too.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.514
* And the way you talk

18:34.547 --> 18:36.249
* You always look so good

18:36.283 --> 18:38.451
That's my baby!

18:38.485 --> 18:42.289
Man, this kid
is incredible.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.224
Even before video

18:44.257 --> 18:46.459
Drew learned the secret
to being a good singer

18:46.493 --> 18:48.528
is to not sing at all.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.762
* Candy girl...

18:49.796 --> 18:53.733
Goodness. Oh, Drew,
you were great.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.536
You looked great,
you danced great

18:56.569 --> 18:58.605
and your lip-synching--
oh, thank goodness.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.640
I mean, you were really
incredible, baby.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.210
You didn't think I was
going to sing, did you?

19:03.243 --> 19:04.477
Mama, I can't sing.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.512
We know.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.846
Hush, Tonya.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.948
Now go on upstairs
and take off that suit.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.850
And hang it up
if it's not too smelly.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.820
Hey, man, how'd it go
without the socks today?

19:13.853 --> 19:17.424
Well, everything is back
to being as bad as usual.

19:17.457 --> 19:20.393
But I did get an "A"
on my history test.
"A"?

19:20.427 --> 19:21.661
That's great.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.529
I'm proud of you.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.564
Well, I did have a
pretty good teacher.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.534
Here, boy, here's
your socks.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.536
I thought you said
you got rid of them.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.538
I just wanted to clean them.

19:31.571 --> 19:32.839
You going
to put them on?

19:32.872 --> 19:35.542
No, I don't think so.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.909
I don't need them anymore.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.177
Here.

19:42.549 --> 19:46.553
Well, I guess I could keep them
for just a little while longer.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.288
You know, just in case.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.457
Yeah,
just in case.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.726
Yeah, just in case the circus
comes back in town.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.996
I wasn't prepared to spend
the rest of my life

19:57.029 --> 19:59.499
at the mercy of a pair
of socks.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.933
Any luck
from this point forward,

20:00.967 --> 20:02.569
I would make on my own.

20:08.608 --> 20:09.976
Ow.

20:10.009 --> 20:14.347
* Everybody hates Chris.
