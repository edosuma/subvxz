WEBVTT

00:22.397 --> 00:25.359
Doesn't it just feed your heart
when the air's so crisp?

00:25.442 --> 00:27.361
Every breath feels so alive!

00:28.529 --> 00:31.156
It's the perfect day
for a tragical romance!

00:31.240 --> 00:33.659
Lord Tennyson would approve!

00:40.165 --> 00:44.086
Whomever plays Elaine must lie
in the flat and float to Camelot

00:44.169 --> 00:47.381
while the others mourn her death
most sorrowfully.

00:47.464 --> 00:50.550
I find it helpful to think of something
that makes you sad in your own life.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.594
Of course you must be Elaine, Anne.

00:52.678 --> 00:55.097
Oh, it would be ridiculous
to have a redheaded Elaine.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.392
It ought to be Ruby.
She has lovely, golden hair.

00:58.475 --> 01:02.062
And Elaine had "all her bright hair
streaming down."

01:02.145 --> 01:04.397
Oh, I couldn't.

01:04.815 --> 01:07.818
To lie and pretend I was dead...
I'd die of fright!

01:07.901 --> 01:09.903
This was your idea, Anne.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.197
You're obsessed with Elaine.

01:12.281 --> 01:15.534
Oh, it's true.
And each time I read the poem,

01:15.617 --> 01:18.287
I'm devoured by a secret regret
that I was not born in Camelot.

01:18.370 --> 01:21.123
Those days were much more romantic
than the present.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.585
I will be Elaine, then.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.840
Diana?

01:31.216 --> 01:33.552
Well, I never...

01:33.635 --> 01:34.678
Diana!

01:35.512 --> 01:37.472
Ruby, you must be King Arthur.

01:37.556 --> 01:41.643
Jane, Guinevere and Diana
must be Lancelot.

01:42.477 --> 01:43.854
I need a flower.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.276
She does really look dead.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.237
My mother says that all playacting
is abominably wicked.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.156
Ruby,
you shouldn't mention your mother.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.450
It spoils the effect,
because this was hundreds of years

01:56.533 --> 01:58.118
before your mother was born.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.412
We must kiss her quiet brows.

02:04.041 --> 02:07.377
Sister... farewell forever.

02:09.378 --> 02:13.008
Now she's ready.
Farewell, Elaine the lovable!

02:13.091 --> 02:14.718
Diana!!

02:14.801 --> 02:17.387
- Mother!
- Child, come out of there at once.

02:20.724 --> 02:23.685
I've been calling.
You were to be practicing lessons,

02:23.769 --> 02:27.939
and here I find you engaged in perilous,
senseless... whatever this is!

02:28.023 --> 02:29.691
We were practicing lessons, in a way.

02:29.775 --> 02:32.235
We're studying the poem
<i>Lancelot and Elaine </i> at school,

02:32.319 --> 02:34.780
- and we decided to re-enact it...
- Diana, home. Now.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.823
The rest as well,
before you catch your death.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.617
The girls just got here
and we were simply...

02:38.700 --> 02:40.827
Now! I will be heard!

02:46.917 --> 02:48.794
Anne, be on your way, please.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.463
Come along now, Diana.
Come along, girls.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.759
So much for romance.

03:39.928 --> 03:43.140
Is it addressed to Anne Shirley-Cuthbert
from a faraway port?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.933
I'm afraid not.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.866
We've got post! I thought for a moment
it might be from Gil...

04:00.949 --> 04:02.743
That it might be for me.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.537
But... Open it!

04:07.581 --> 04:08.999
It must be important.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.293
Is that not your second letter
from Miss Jeannie?

04:11.376 --> 04:12.335
Third.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.046
I'm ever so aimless
with Diana not allowed out to play.

04:15.130 --> 04:18.466
Mrs. Barry is being quite harsh.
We weren't in peril.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.594
It's not like we were ever
in any real danger.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.763
Not like when the boarders were here.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.182
We were re-enacting
the most romantical poem ever.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.392
Dear Lord,
will you ever learn any sense?

04:27.476 --> 04:30.187
No need to ask the Lord, Marilla.
I believe the prospect

04:30.270 --> 04:33.398
of me becoming sensible
is actually brighter now than ever.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.192
You see, I've come to the conclusion

04:35.275 --> 04:37.694
that there's really no use
trying to be romantic in Avonlea.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.697
It may have been easy in Camelot
hundreds of years ago,

04:40.781 --> 04:43.200
but romance is not appreciated anymore.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.787
It's a day late and a dollar
short for your newfound "sensibleness."

04:46.870 --> 04:50.165
I dare say Mrs. Barry was right
to call your pond business dangerous.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.417
Seeing as you can't seem
to keep out of trouble,

04:52.501 --> 04:54.503
you will confine yourself
to indoor chores.

04:54.586 --> 04:55.629
But, Marilla...

04:55.712 --> 04:58.215
Well, now, that was a good few days ago.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.217
We all need to stop gallivanting around

05:00.300 --> 05:02.886
like nothing bad could ever happen
in Avonlea!

05:11.853 --> 05:16.066
Don't give up all your romance, Anne.
A little of it's a good thing.

05:16.525 --> 05:19.736
Oh, for heaven's sake.
They're going to need to go higher.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.864
You'll have to move the rod.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.911
Yes... it was too peaceful in here.

05:30.539 --> 05:34.459
Why don't you go for a trot, dear?
You haven't left the house in days.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.002
I'm quite alright, thank you.

05:36.086 --> 05:39.756
Despite the glare from the gaudy drapes
you seem to have spent our nest egg on.

05:42.092 --> 05:45.303
I'm sure I don't need to remind you
that I purchased these drapes

05:45.387 --> 05:46.888
before you lost our money.

05:46.972 --> 05:49.808
Around the time you were telling me
to stay out of our finances

05:49.891 --> 05:52.102
and trust that you were
going to make us rich.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.731
Would you excuse us for a moment,
please?

06:04.573 --> 06:06.533
We'll never return to England now,
will we?

06:06.616 --> 06:08.201
We're stuck here!

06:08.785 --> 06:12.372
What about the girls?
What about their future?

06:14.374 --> 06:17.043
This is something that happened
to our whole family.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.837
You cannot just refuse to engage...

06:18.920 --> 06:22.048
At least I was trying to do something,

06:22.132 --> 06:25.468
while you flit around all day
doing nothing.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.533
"Matthew,
I'm sure I've made it clear by now,

07:30.617 --> 07:34.120
but I've been thinking of you
since we reconnected last year.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.998
If you could find it in your heart
to respond,

07:37.082 --> 07:38.667
it would mean the world to me.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.002
You are a special man.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.545
Yours, Jeannie."

07:43.088 --> 07:45.256
Have you ever heard anything
more romantic?

07:45.340 --> 07:47.133
What does it mean?

07:47.217 --> 07:48.593
Don't you see?

07:48.677 --> 07:51.221
A widow, who believes her days of love
are behind her,

07:51.304 --> 07:52.722
is suddenly reacquainted

07:52.806 --> 07:55.976
with the kindest, most wonderful man,
who she knew in school,

07:56.059 --> 07:57.769
only to discover

07:57.852 --> 08:01.481
that he has lived his whole life
without the bliss of true love.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.608
They knew each other in school?

08:03.692 --> 08:05.944
Why, Gilbert and I knew each other
in school.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.198
Maybe Matthew's been waiting
for Jeannie this whole time.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.158
Why isn't he writing her back?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.786
He doesn't have the words.

08:16.496 --> 08:21.126
It would be awful to live a life
without true love.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.256
I will be an agent of romance.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.384
How can you be sure
that Matthew and Jeannie are in love?

08:32.470 --> 08:34.139
Did you ever go courting, Matthew?

08:36.265 --> 08:40.352
Uh... c-can't say as I did, no.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.107
Well, do you... believe in true love?

08:44.190 --> 08:47.318
Well, now... I got no reason to, uh...

08:47.402 --> 08:49.029
disbelieve it, I suppose.

08:49.112 --> 08:52.198
But did you ever feel the ache of love
in your own heart?

08:52.282 --> 08:54.284
I wonder if Marilla
isn't the one that y...

08:54.367 --> 08:56.077
I want to talk to you.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.457
Alright, then.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.542
Uh, well, then...

09:05.003 --> 09:05.837
Anne...

09:07.047 --> 09:09.924
if you're having... uh...

09:10.008 --> 09:11.551
feelings...

09:11.634 --> 09:14.929
a-about a... a... a boy...

09:15.013 --> 09:16.556
Not <i>me!</i>

09:23.438 --> 09:25.315
Oh, uh, excuse me, Anne.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.194
Jerry, let me give you some instructions
about the hay.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.865
Blythe, you ready?
One rum, one babash.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.954
Ooh! Oof.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.831
You sure that's not gonna kill you?

09:41.915 --> 09:44.584
No. That's what makes it good.
The danger.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.711
Got to taste death to feel alive,
Blythe.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.505
Not for you, though, first-timer.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.925
Babash... local delicacy.
You'll be sprouting like a weed.

09:53.051 --> 09:57.305
Man, seeing the world,
trying new things.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.099
What could be better?

09:59.557 --> 10:00.391
Gold.

10:01.017 --> 10:04.562
Some girl tell you there might be gold
on your land and you'd rather move coal.

10:05.146 --> 10:08.733
I wouldn't say that girl's
the most reliable narrator.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.987
You are crazy!
If I had somebody pretty back home,

10:13.071 --> 10:15.573
gold or no, I'd be up outta here.

10:15.657 --> 10:19.160
It's not like that with Anne.
She's just a friend.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.537
Yeah.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.207
A friend that make you smile
and act like a moke. Be a man.

10:24.916 --> 10:25.750
I am.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.503
Only a boy can't admit
when he's gone over a lady.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.467
Would a boy stare danger
right in the eye?

10:34.926 --> 10:36.427
- And swallow it?
- Hey. No, no!

10:39.472 --> 10:40.682
Oh.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.016
Oh...

10:42.851 --> 10:44.269
- Oh. Oh!
- Oh.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.986
There there, doux-doux.
You're a man in truth.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.655
Come, come.

10:58.283 --> 11:01.035
Marilla's got a mind
to make a new dress, has she?

11:01.119 --> 11:03.538
She'd do well not to let folks
see her spending money

11:03.621 --> 11:04.998
at a time when many lost theirs.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.751
I'm not sure a dress made by Marilla
will make people think of money.

11:10.503 --> 11:15.049
Although, a store-bought dress
from Jeannie's shop, on the other hand.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.803
It was ever so nice of Matthew to ask
Jeannie to make me a dress last year.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.389
Did they know each other well?
In school?

11:21.472 --> 11:24.225
Can't say I remember much,
seeing as it was decades ago.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.186
I do recall that he walked her home
a few times.

11:29.564 --> 11:34.193
But after his brother Michael died,
that was the end of everything.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.112
The end of everything? How so?

11:36.195 --> 11:38.698
It changed the course
of all the Cuthberts' lives.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.366
And Matthew,

11:40.450 --> 11:43.786
<i>he went into that barn...
and he never came out.</i>

11:48.541 --> 11:50.919
Love thwarted by tragedy.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.213
Dearest Jeannie,

11:55.131 --> 11:58.801
I am deeply sorry...

12:00.803 --> 12:03.264
it has...

12:03.348 --> 12:05.850
taken so long...

12:05.934 --> 12:10.563
to answer your letters.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.484
Do not move.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.071
Minnie May.
Minnie May, what are you doing?!

12:18.655 --> 12:20.365
Stop it, Minnie May!

12:22.742 --> 12:24.869
<i>Social Etiquette?</i>

12:24.953 --> 12:27.246
- Girls!
- It was... it was Minnie May!

12:27.330 --> 12:28.665
- Diana did it!
- Hush!

12:28.748 --> 12:31.542
I can see this book has arrived
not a moment too soon.

12:32.502 --> 12:36.005
If you can't be finished in Paris,
you will be taught at home.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.716
It's time to learn to be proper ladies.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.261
Childhood... is over.

12:43.930 --> 12:44.889
Girls.

13:01.656 --> 13:04.117
Yes, well... isn't that something.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.663
Changing the world, are we, dear?
One curtsy at a time?

13:14.544 --> 13:17.547
It's been a while since I've seen you
out of the house, Marilla.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.966
I've been curious to see
how the Cuthberts have been faring

13:20.049 --> 13:22.260
since the golden boy
made off with all our savings.

13:22.343 --> 13:25.555
Of course I do understand
why you haven't been out and about.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.598
And it's likely best
you stay away from the church

13:27.682 --> 13:29.726
on account of the whole town
is still quite sore.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.437
We were made to look like fools,

13:32.520 --> 13:34.147
and folks are suffering.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.732
It's not just the Barrys.

13:35.815 --> 13:40.069
Close on half the congregation had given
Nate their money before he made off.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.572
Do you think
that's gonna make for an easy winter?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.949
<i>There is indeed gold in Avonlea.</i>

13:45.033 --> 13:46.743
<i>A hundred and fifty dollars per test...</i>

13:46.826 --> 13:49.370
<i>That's close to half
of what most folks make in a year.</i>

13:49.454 --> 13:51.080
<i>We're in such danger, Marilla!</i>

13:51.164 --> 13:53.207
I didn't think it was right
to sit here,

13:53.291 --> 13:54.917
serve tea and not say something.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.047
I do blame myself.

14:00.256 --> 14:03.468
I brought them here, allowed them in.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.098
Well, now,

14:09.182 --> 14:11.517
anyone with your dire financial straits
last Christmas

14:11.601 --> 14:14.312
would've done the same thing.
It's not your fault.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.482
That's what I say.
All will be forgiven in time.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.859
Apart from the minister.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.653
He had his heart set
on a new chaise lounge

14:22.737 --> 14:24.989
from which to better
talk off the ear of the Lord.

14:25.073 --> 14:28.618
Be a few moons before you're back
in his good books.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.875
We'll put it behind us.

14:38.795 --> 14:42.757
Wares for sale! Wares for sale!
Something for everybody!

14:42.840 --> 14:44.092
Uh!

14:44.675 --> 14:45.968
Uh...

14:46.052 --> 14:47.678
beautiful day, ya?

14:51.099 --> 14:53.768
Oh. Where are these from?

14:53.851 --> 14:55.603
Oh, wait. A Russian tsar,

14:55.686 --> 14:59.315
Anatoly, pulled these off
his dying brother in battle.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.067
And his brother, who was a pacifist,

15:01.150 --> 15:04.487
who went to war
only to protect greedy Anatoly,

15:04.570 --> 15:08.449
and who, in death,
taught the tsar to lead with love.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.828
Such an interesting, um, uh...

15:11.911 --> 15:13.037
- Imagination?
- Hm!

15:13.121 --> 15:15.331
Yes, I get that quite a bit.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.916
Oh, what's this?

15:17.333 --> 15:19.752
That... belonged to my wife.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.964
She give in hope I sell
and we together sooner.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.341
Where is she?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.969
She and my children still in Germany.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.513
I work night and day to bring them here.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.015
Not good for Jewish people there.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.018
Treated like, uh...

15:37.019 --> 15:38.563
You must miss them so.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.065
Now I know
what it is to have a family,

15:41.149 --> 15:44.861
I cannot fathom what it would be like
not to see them every day.

15:50.450 --> 15:54.912
Oh, I would die to be able to give
my bosom friend something like this.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.581
It's broken.

15:58.583 --> 16:02.170
I think broken things
have such a sad beauty.

16:02.253 --> 16:05.756
After years of stories and triumph

16:05.840 --> 16:08.426
and tragedy infused into them,

16:08.509 --> 16:12.096
they can be much more romantical
than new things

16:12.180 --> 16:14.182
that haven't lived at all.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.817
Oh, I don't have any money.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.194
It's yours.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.031
You! Get away from her!

16:30.114 --> 16:32.074
- Wha...
- How dare you trespass?!

16:32.158 --> 16:33.659
Uh, but... but...

16:33.743 --> 16:36.704
- Marilla... it's alright!
- Madam, I...

16:36.787 --> 16:37.747
Off my land!

16:39.582 --> 16:41.125
He's a peddler, he's kind.

16:41.209 --> 16:44.420
- Anne!
- It's fine. I go. I go.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.091
Anne Shirley-Cuthbert!

16:49.175 --> 16:51.719
How many times have I warned you
about speaking to strangers?!

16:51.802 --> 16:54.347
- And Italians at that!
- He's not Italian and he gave me...

16:54.430 --> 16:57.266
You can't just go around inviting
strange men into the house!

16:58.851 --> 17:00.770
I didn't invite him in.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.607
Go to your room, please.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.906
There you are, miss.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.704
Dearest Jeannie...

18:05.418 --> 18:07.420
My...

18:07.503 --> 18:08.671
darling...

18:09.422 --> 18:10.923
Jeannie.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.095
Have you heard...

18:17.513 --> 18:20.308
of... a calla lily?

18:20.808 --> 18:23.102
Anne! School!

18:27.732 --> 18:30.276
I never want to be a lady.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.362
If little girls could understand
the vulgarity of putting heads together

18:33.446 --> 18:36.574
and giggling as if the whole world
was a ridiculous affair,

18:36.657 --> 18:39.869
they would refrain
from such unmitigated nonsense.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.038
"No laughing. No waddling.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.082
Only look straight ahead of you
when walking.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.169
Burping is social ruin"? Ah...

18:48.878 --> 18:51.255
We can no longer afford
finishing school in Paris,

18:51.339 --> 18:53.758
so Mother's determined
to finish me herself.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.010
She says childhood is over.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.555
But... but how can you be done
having a childhood

18:59.639 --> 19:01.515
when I've only just begun?

19:01.599 --> 19:03.017
Oh, Anne.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.690
- Sorry.
- It's alright.

19:09.774 --> 19:13.402
We've only just learned that our
friendship has been sentenced to death.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.491
Is there a ridiculous, hateful book
that teaches boys to be men?

19:18.574 --> 19:20.660
If there was, it... wouldn't help me.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.203
What do you mean?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.247
Nothing. Sorry.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.762
Social ruin!

19:43.140 --> 19:44.350
Shhh.

19:45.559 --> 19:46.977
I'm sorry.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.691
- Have another one for you, Mr. Cuthbert.
- Yeah? Much obliged.

20:02.243 --> 20:05.371
Seems there's been a flurry of post
of late.

20:08.416 --> 20:11.669
Don't suppose it'd kill you
to respond to Jeannie.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.389
That'll be all for me, then.

20:25.683 --> 20:26.851
Good night.

21:03.429 --> 21:06.307
"In answer... to your question..."?

21:14.857 --> 21:16.317
To your question...

22:27.054 --> 22:29.223
Yes! Rescue me from geometry,

22:29.306 --> 22:31.809
the most uninspired form of torture.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.148
I know...

22:39.942 --> 22:41.527
you've written to Jeannie.

22:43.529 --> 22:44.947
I want to tell you...

22:46.866 --> 22:48.117
It's not right.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.706
I wasn't... I wasn't trying
to go behind your back.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.583
I just...

22:56.875 --> 23:00.254
Y-you can't... live a life
without true love...

23:00.337 --> 23:03.173
It's not your affair to meddle in.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.261
Jeannie is...

23:08.554 --> 23:10.180
Folks have...

23:10.889 --> 23:12.182
real feelings.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.060
What you did...

23:17.021 --> 23:18.439
it's not right.

23:43.797 --> 23:45.132
This is cold again.

23:45.883 --> 23:48.969
Minnie May, stop chewing so noisily.
You sound like an animal.

23:53.599 --> 23:56.226
Don't stare when someone
is scolding their child.

23:56.310 --> 23:57.728
It's extremely rude.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.022
I see the finishing is going well.

24:00.230 --> 24:03.567
At this rate, they'll be married
to fishmongers before we know it.

24:19.249 --> 24:22.211
What's wrong with Mr. Cuthbert?
Everything is better now.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.046
We... we caught the bad guys.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.174
Is he sad that people lost money?

24:28.759 --> 24:32.179
- Is he... is he sick again? His heart?
- It's none of your business!

25:45.502 --> 25:49.256
Have you ever hurt someone so badly
that they couldn't love you anymore?

26:37.471 --> 26:39.348
How could you do such a thing?!

26:40.015 --> 26:41.266
Do you have any control?

26:41.350 --> 26:44.186
You'll be fortunate if you can get
a fishmonger to marry you...

26:44.269 --> 26:45.437
- Diana!
- What?!

26:53.070 --> 26:54.196
You wet the bed.

26:56.490 --> 26:59.076
How come no one loves each other
anymore?

27:04.206 --> 27:05.499
I'm sorry.

27:17.511 --> 27:18.679
I'm so sorry.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.532
Can we have a conversation, please?

27:39.032 --> 27:41.618
If you could forgo
the wounded-bird act.

27:48.625 --> 27:51.628
There is too much stress and anger
in this house.

27:52.713 --> 27:56.300
If we don't stop being enemies
and start speaking to one another,

27:56.383 --> 27:58.010
we're going to ruin our girls.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.888
I'm not the one
playing the drill sergeant with them.

28:00.971 --> 28:03.307
I understand I have a role in this!

28:03.390 --> 28:06.768
But it doesn't change the fact
that we need to talk!

28:06.852 --> 28:09.980
And what is it you would like
to talk about, dear?

28:10.063 --> 28:13.609
What would you like to force me to say,
aloud, in front of you?

28:13.692 --> 28:16.361
That I'm a fool? That I'm ashamed?

28:16.445 --> 28:18.363
That I've made a huge mistake?

28:18.447 --> 28:19.489
Yes.

28:21.366 --> 28:24.369
Because then I'd be able
to tell you I would've agreed with you.

28:24.453 --> 28:28.415
If you'd asked for my thoughts
on the gold or the investment idea,

28:28.498 --> 28:30.292
I would've agreed.

28:30.375 --> 28:33.086
And then we could've both been fools
together.

28:33.170 --> 28:37.966
But you insist on taking this
all upon yourself... then and now!

28:51.897 --> 28:56.318
I just... wanted to do something
that mattered for once...

28:56.693 --> 29:01.031
in my... sorry... irrelevant life.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.800
I don't want us to not make mistakes.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.345
I just want to be included.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.057
I want us to be partners.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.983
<i>"I know how hard it is for you
to express yourself.</i>

29:36.692 --> 29:38.485
That has never been my weak point.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.654
And then I thought back
to when you told me

29:40.737 --> 29:42.489
not to give up all my romance.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.742
And that,
together with what Mrs. Lynde told me

29:45.826 --> 29:48.453
about when Michael died and how hard..."

29:49.746 --> 29:51.748
I can well understand all that.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.750
I just wish you hadn't done it.

30:07.848 --> 30:10.309
Make haste sending that love letter,
Blythe.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.977
It's not a love letter.

30:12.060 --> 30:15.272
- Right. I forgot.
- I'm serious. It's not a love letter.

30:20.277 --> 30:23.113
How long they say
till she gets your love letter?

30:23.196 --> 30:26.408
It's not a love letter.
Maybe a month?

30:32.205 --> 30:35.417
Help!

30:36.585 --> 30:37.711
Ah! Please!

30:37.794 --> 30:40.297
You, you don't come back here again!

30:40.380 --> 30:42.341
Please!

30:43.008 --> 30:44.301
No! Pl...

30:44.801 --> 30:48.055
- What's wrong? What is it?
- She's in labor!

30:48.138 --> 30:50.849
Miss, where's your family?

30:50.932 --> 30:53.852
She ain't have one, and her brothel
mother just threw her out!

30:53.935 --> 30:55.729
- There a doctor coming?
- Hey!

30:55.812 --> 30:58.607
- Miss? Is a doctor on the way?
- Open this door! You can't do this!

30:58.690 --> 31:00.067
- Open the door!
- Miss?

31:00.150 --> 31:02.569
Open this door!

31:03.820 --> 31:05.822
You can't do this! Open the door!

31:05.906 --> 31:07.908
Open the door!

31:24.174 --> 31:25.842
Miss?

31:25.926 --> 31:27.177
Miss?

31:28.678 --> 31:30.055
Miss.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.433
Miss.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.685
I know you must be scared.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.023
What's your name?

31:40.107 --> 31:42.442
Ru... Ruth.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.236
Ruth, I'm Gilbert.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.115
Your waters have broken.

31:48.198 --> 31:50.534
Ah! Yes! Yes!

32:02.712 --> 32:05.298
- We have to get help.
- No time. This is happening now.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.676
I need your babash.

32:07.759 --> 32:08.885
I need to sterilize.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.512
Crazy? You ain't delivering that baby.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.347
What on the green earth
makes you think you...

32:12.431 --> 32:14.975
- I've done it before!
- On a farm! Cows! This is different!

32:15.058 --> 32:17.018
I know that!

32:17.602 --> 32:19.938
You can go and find help,
or you can help me in here.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.366
- What are you doing?!
- Ruth, your baby's coming now.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.911
No. No, you stay away from me!

32:36.371 --> 32:40.292
- We're here to help.
- You keep that white man away from me!!

32:40.375 --> 32:43.086
I know.
This pasty fella trying to come at you?

32:43.170 --> 32:46.006
I was not sure when I met him neither.
He'll talk your ear off

32:46.089 --> 32:48.383
and don't know much about the world.
But he knows birthing.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.051
He's my brother and I trust him.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.179
If your baby's coming,
he can't leave you.

32:52.262 --> 32:56.099
- I can go for help.
- No! No, no, no, no, no...

32:56.183 --> 32:59.519
We're here for you, in truth,
if you'll have us.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.191
Wh-what now, Blythe?

33:04.274 --> 33:05.734
Blythe!

33:05.817 --> 33:08.737
Dilation! I need to see that her body
is prepared. Help her down here!

33:08.820 --> 33:10.822
Ruth, I'm gonna need you to lie down.

33:10.906 --> 33:11.740
Alright?

33:16.620 --> 33:18.079
Get behind her. Support her.

33:19.414 --> 33:21.082
Good.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.504
Begging your pardon, miss?

33:27.464 --> 33:28.465
Alright.

33:35.138 --> 33:38.767
Alright. It's time. Alright, uh...

33:41.603 --> 33:44.564
What?! What is it?! What?

33:47.359 --> 33:48.693
Your baby's breech.

33:48.777 --> 33:51.029
What is that?!

33:51.112 --> 33:54.449
It-it's not in a deliverable position.
I'm gonna need to adjust it.

33:57.327 --> 33:59.454
Hold onto me, Ruth!

34:01.122 --> 34:03.041
Hold onto me!

34:05.669 --> 34:06.711
Ruth. Ruth.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.170
Do you want to know something?

34:08.672 --> 34:10.340
I was a breech baby too,

34:10.422 --> 34:12.801
and I lived to tell the tale.

34:14.969 --> 34:18.056
He was in his mother
just like your baby is in you now.

34:18.139 --> 34:22.601
Look at him! Strong, strapping lad.
Well, he kind of skinny, but...

34:49.713 --> 34:53.507
It's moved! The baby is ready!
You'll have to start pushing now!

34:53.592 --> 34:56.428
- I can't, I can't! It hurts!
- Yes, you can!

34:56.511 --> 34:59.347
- Push, Ruth. You're doing so well!
- Ready? Push!

34:59.431 --> 35:01.182
Push!

35:02.350 --> 35:04.227
- Push!
- Push!

35:04.311 --> 35:06.521
Push, Ruth!

35:07.147 --> 35:08.732
Come on, Ruth, you can do it!

35:13.695 --> 35:16.197
Almost there. One more, one more! Push!

35:54.569 --> 35:57.072
You see that face?
She's beautiful.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.158
Thank you.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.852
Any idea where Matthew's off to?

36:33.316 --> 36:36.528
Well... I think I've ruined everything.

36:42.826 --> 36:43.702
Whoa!

36:44.285 --> 36:45.829
Come on, change, boys.

36:47.831 --> 36:49.624
Let's change. Switch it up!

36:55.296 --> 36:57.298
Wouldn't mind having one of those.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.384
A struggling, wailing lil' fella.

36:59.467 --> 37:02.429
Throw the ball with.
Bouff when he backchats.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.432
I could see that for you.

37:05.515 --> 37:08.393
Got no way to raise him up right.
You need land for that.

37:09.644 --> 37:12.230
What kind of strange child
were you anyway, Blythe?

37:12.313 --> 37:14.482
Needing to know
about your own breech birth.

37:15.608 --> 37:19.237
I didn't want to know about my birth.
I wanted to know about my mother.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.989
So I asked my father.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.410
She died giving birth to me.

37:26.119 --> 37:28.455
Sorry. My brain is slow.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.081
It's alright.

37:31.166 --> 37:32.917
Didn't want Ruth to know that part.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.632
I don't want to be a farmer.

37:39.716 --> 37:42.302
You said that before. Now you're sure?

37:45.096 --> 37:47.515
Guess there's other things
calling out to you.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.225
Eh... Doc?

37:57.192 --> 37:59.027
It's a powerful thing

37:59.110 --> 38:01.404
to have done someone wrong...

38:01.488 --> 38:03.698
when you truly didn't intend it.

38:04.657 --> 38:07.535
I tried to apologize,
but it didn't fix anything.

38:10.163 --> 38:11.790
I allow we must...

38:11.873 --> 38:14.626
let people feel how they need to...

38:15.585 --> 38:17.378
and process in their own time.

38:25.136 --> 38:28.473
Would you like to talk
about the letters, Matthew?

38:28.556 --> 38:31.518
Uh, yes, uh... I would, yes.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.311
Uh...

38:36.815 --> 38:39.108
I meant to write you back, but I, um...

38:40.527 --> 38:45.198
Were you able to tell
it was Anne writing? It was not me.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.826
I only... I just found out about it.

38:48.409 --> 38:49.536
Oh, goodness.

38:51.621 --> 38:52.956
Oh, of course.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.251
Now that you mention it,
I should've put it together.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.002
Jeannie, I'd like to apologize...

38:58.086 --> 39:00.713
I... I did feel that the letters
were unlike you, but...

39:00.797 --> 39:03.091
I suppose part of me hoped...

39:03.174 --> 39:06.970
I should've answered you straight away.
I mean, that's my fault in it.

39:07.220 --> 39:10.181
I didn't intend
to make you uncomfortable, Matthew.

39:10.265 --> 39:11.933
It's just...

39:12.016 --> 39:14.602
It's just been so nice to reacquaint.

39:17.564 --> 39:19.232
I had thought of you...

39:20.400 --> 39:21.985
after I left school,

39:22.569 --> 39:23.695
over the years.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.906
And I did appreciate the letters.
It's only...

39:26.990 --> 39:29.993
it took Anne so long to get here and...

39:31.244 --> 39:33.746
You want to spend the time
you have left with her.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.299
To be quite honest,
I felt overwhelmed

39:44.382 --> 39:47.468
when you did respond
and compared me to calla lilies.

39:50.889 --> 39:55.310
- She does have a way with words.
- I'm not certain that I want to know.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.815
Children make mistakes
and not always

40:00.899 --> 40:03.484
with the best of intentions,
unlike your Anne.

40:05.403 --> 40:09.240
She didn't have an easy go of it.
You know, before.

40:09.782 --> 40:13.661
She's certainly been blessed
with a life with you at Green Gables.

40:19.042 --> 40:21.044
We could go back if you like.

40:21.794 --> 40:24.172
Or there's a lovely trail up ahead.

40:26.841 --> 40:30.053
W-wouldn't mind seeing that trail,
if you've got the time.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.864
- Ah!
- Aha!

41:09.676 --> 41:11.678
Whoa.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.707
Whoa, whoa.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.322
I'm sorry, Matthew.

42:14.699 --> 42:17.618
I just didn't want you
to miss out on love.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.787
I don't know how...

42:20.288 --> 42:21.956
you could think that, uh...

42:22.373 --> 42:24.167
I don't have...

42:24.959 --> 42:25.918
love.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.547
I have you.

42:52.445 --> 42:53.571
I'm free to be a girl!

42:53.654 --> 42:55.990
Mother says there's plenty of time
to become a lady.

42:56.074 --> 42:58.743
And at least for a little while longer,
we can play!

42:58.826 --> 43:00.286
Oh, Diana, if you'd come and told me

43:00.369 --> 43:02.330
a Fairy Queen had come
to stay in your house,

43:02.413 --> 43:05.458
I couldn't be happier than this moment!

43:05.541 --> 43:08.127
Oh, I have something for you!

43:11.547 --> 43:12.590
Oh.

43:17.136 --> 43:18.346
We can each have a part.

43:19.013 --> 43:21.265
And it will only be whole
when we're together.

43:28.564 --> 43:31.526
You're no match for me, Prince Wisteria!

43:31.609 --> 43:34.695
That's what you think, Princess Cordelia!
