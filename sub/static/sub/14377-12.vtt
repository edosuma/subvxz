Turner entertainment group
and U.S. department of education

00:48.216 --> 00:50.400
Oh! Why, yes,
I do have a big
test today.

00:50.433 --> 00:53.450
And, of course,
as every test-taker knows,

00:53.483 --> 00:57.016
there's one thing
you cannot do without.

00:57.050 --> 00:58.483
Why, it's no secret.

00:59.016 --> 00:59.383
A pencil.

00:59.416 --> 01:01.283
A<i>number</i>

01:01.316 --> 01:04.300
why, this baby
has done me right
all year.

01:04.333 --> 01:09.050
I would not be
caught dead in a test
without this!

01:10.300 --> 01:13.383
Boy: Force field,
force field.

01:13.416 --> 01:15.300
Force field,
force field.

01:15.333 --> 01:17.016
Hello, Douglas.

01:17.050 --> 01:20.200
I saved your usual seat
in the forward quadrant,
old buddy.

01:20.233 --> 01:22.283
Thanks, old buddy.

01:22.316 --> 01:25.050
So, mordecai,
are you fully prepared

01:25.083 --> 01:26.250
for the trigonaculus
test today?

01:26.283 --> 01:30.216
If by that you mean,
did I bring<i>old lucky,</i>
then maybe

01:30.250 --> 01:34.183
<i>this</i>
your question.

01:35.166 --> 01:36.183
[Dexter gasps]

01:36.216 --> 01:37.200
Dexter: Beautiful!

01:37.233 --> 01:39.350
Look at the size of it!

01:39.383 --> 01:42.283
It must have seen
a hundred tests!

01:42.316 --> 01:44.300
It's vintage 1990.

01:44.333 --> 01:46.266
Good year!

01:46.300 --> 01:50.200
[Laughing]

01:52.250 --> 01:54.033
Nice hat, geek.

01:54.066 --> 01:57.316
Har har!
Sticks and stones--

01:57.350 --> 02:00.416
look, Gwen.
Dexter has a purse.

02:00.450 --> 02:02.216
It is a manly backpack.

02:02.250 --> 02:05.150
And you can tell
by the official NASA patch.

02:05.183 --> 02:07.450
Eh, I think I'll
keep it anyhow.

02:07.483 --> 02:13.150
Go ahead. I have memorized
every paragraph of info
in those books

02:13.183 --> 02:15.300
in prep for the trig test.

02:15.333 --> 02:16.383
Hey, Becky.

02:16.416 --> 02:18.433
Don't<i>you</i>
that test today,
too?

02:18.466 --> 02:22.216
Why, yes,
I believe I do.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.216
Well, then,

02:23.250 --> 02:24.450
you'll need a...

02:24.483 --> 02:26.433
Number 2 pencil!

02:26.466 --> 02:29.183
Return that instrument!

02:29.216 --> 02:30.216
It belongs to me.

02:30.250 --> 02:33.216
Oh, yeah? Then come
and get it, shrimp.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.350
Gladly.

02:34.383 --> 02:36.000
[Yelling]

02:36.033 --> 02:37.333
Becky, catch.

02:37.366 --> 02:38.333
Oops!

02:38.366 --> 02:39.350
[Kids cheering]

02:39.383 --> 02:41.383
Jump! Jump! Jump!

02:41.416 --> 02:42.416
You go, Dexter!

02:42.450 --> 02:45.216
You can get it!
Jump!

02:48.250 --> 02:50.416
Careful of the instrument!

02:58.283 --> 02:59.300
[Kids mumbling]

02:59.333 --> 03:02.266
Kids: Oh, no!
The back of the bus!

03:02.300 --> 03:07.416
Just let it go,
Dexter. Maybe you
can use a pen.

03:07.450 --> 03:09.166
[Sighs defiantly]

03:09.200 --> 03:10.200
Kids: No, don't do it!

03:10.233 --> 03:14.116
Don't do it, Dexter.
It's not worth it.

03:14.150 --> 03:17.050
It's too close
to<i>the darkness.</i>

03:17.083 --> 03:18.283
This is ridiculous.

03:18.316 --> 03:21.383
I am not scared
of some old
superstition.

03:21.416 --> 03:25.200
I am a man of science.
This is bogus.

03:25.233 --> 03:27.050
Boy, German accent:
Oh, no,

03:27.083 --> 03:27.466
it's true.

03:28.000 --> 03:28.450
[Chomp]

03:28.483 --> 03:31.050
I'll tell you
just what happened.

03:31.083 --> 03:34.400
Little Billy blumberg
was just horsing about

03:34.433 --> 03:37.483
and eating cookies. Mmm...

03:38.016 --> 03:39.250
Then bus hit a bump,

03:39.283 --> 03:42.016
and Billy spill
his hot cocoa.

03:42.050 --> 03:43.016
Mmm...

03:43.050 --> 03:44.183
[Screaming]

03:44.216 --> 03:45.133
Driver panic

03:45.166 --> 03:48.066
and almost hit
ice cream truck.

03:48.100 --> 03:48.433
Mmm...

03:48.466 --> 03:51.066
Angry driver send Billy

03:51.100 --> 03:52.433
to back of bus.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.066
And Billy, his screams

03:55.100 --> 03:57.466
melt with sound
of hungry monster.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
[Maniacal laughter]

03:59.033 --> 04:01.283
Girl: Nuh-uh,
that's not what happened.

04:01.316 --> 04:02.416
My mom knew Billy,

04:02.450 --> 04:05.083
and I know
what really happened.

04:05.116 --> 04:08.333
Girl, voice-over:
Little Billy
was a mean kid.

04:08.366 --> 04:10.350
Once he saw a cute spider,

04:10.383 --> 04:12.000
and he smushed it.

04:12.033 --> 04:15.200
With the spider's
last breath,
he called for help.

04:15.233 --> 04:19.050
Thousands of tiny spiders
came from nowhere

04:19.083 --> 04:20.333
and wrapped him in a web

04:20.366 --> 04:23.216
and dragged him off
to the back of the bus

04:23.250 --> 04:28.066
to lay him before
the giant spider queen.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.050
[Screaming]

04:29.083 --> 04:30.133
[Screaming]

04:30.166 --> 04:31.200
Hey.

04:31.233 --> 04:34.000
This fabrication is
totally unsubstantiated.

04:34.033 --> 04:36.216
I'll fill you in
on the real incident.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.466
There he was,
in the back of the bus,

04:39.000 --> 04:40.083
minding his own business,

04:40.116 --> 04:43.033
when an inter-dimensional
time lord opened a hole

04:43.066 --> 04:45.083
in the space-time continuum.

04:45.116 --> 04:46.050
Hi.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.183
[Gurgling noises]

04:47.216 --> 04:50.400
Little Billy held onto his seat
as long as he could,

04:50.433 --> 04:55.266
but a bipolar tachyon vortex
sucked him into a time egg.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.266
[Screaming]

04:57.300 --> 04:59.200
Oh, please!

04:59.233 --> 05:01.216
This is all superstition.

05:01.250 --> 05:03.083
None of this is proven.

05:03.116 --> 05:07.266
A simple scientific
investigation will solve this.

05:07.300 --> 05:10.050
[Roaring from back of bus]

05:11.200 --> 05:14.366
Gwen: What's the matter,
pipsqueak? You scared?

05:14.400 --> 05:16.083
This is ridiculous.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.133
I'm going in!

05:21.183 --> 05:22.233
Dexter's log.

05:22.266 --> 05:25.166
Various school supplies
seemed to be cocooned

05:25.200 --> 05:29.150
in this strange,
sticky pink goo.

05:29.183 --> 05:30.316
[Rumble]

05:30.350 --> 05:31.450
Aah!

05:33.116 --> 05:34.066
[Roaring]

05:34.100 --> 05:35.316
[Roaring]

05:35.350 --> 05:37.400
Aah!

05:37.433 --> 05:40.016
Here. You dropped this.

05:40.266 --> 05:42.483
Hey there, youngster.
Name's bill.

05:43.016 --> 05:45.300
You are little
Billy blumberg?

05:45.333 --> 05:47.083
Well, that's right,
little chap.

05:47.116 --> 05:49.383
Of course, no one calls me
"little" no more.

05:49.416 --> 05:52.050
Wha-what are you
doing back here?

05:52.083 --> 05:56.216
Ho ho! Heck, that happened
way back when I was
about your age.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.066
Oh, I just fell asleep

05:58.100 --> 05:59.466
with my chewing gum
in my mouth. It fell out,
stuck my hair to the chair.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.050
I struggled to get free,

06:01.083 --> 06:02.233
and my shoe flew off,
and it broke the light.

06:02.266 --> 06:04.366
Of course,
the more I struggled,
the more I got stuck.

06:04.400 --> 06:07.266
And I've been here
for 30 years.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.400
Huh?

06:08.433 --> 06:11.466
And how have you
been surviving
all these years?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.283
Well, I guess I was
pretty lucky
that my shoe flew off

06:14.316 --> 06:16.000
'cause then my toenails
could grow out,

06:16.033 --> 06:18.200
and then when scraps of food
would roll to the back,

06:18.233 --> 06:19.150
I could rake 'em in.

06:19.183 --> 06:20.083
I'll tell you,

06:20.116 --> 06:22.116
you kids eat
the worst junk.

06:22.150 --> 06:23.133
Mmm. Chocolate.

06:23.166 --> 06:26.033
So, did you come
to rescue me, big guy?

06:26.066 --> 06:30.000
Uh, yeah. I suppose
I could cut you free.

06:30.033 --> 06:31.450
With my laser pen.

06:31.483 --> 06:32.383
Oh, yeah.

06:32.416 --> 06:33.483
Feels good.

06:34.016 --> 06:37.000
Oh, I don't know
how I could
ever repay you.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.216
Kids,

06:40.250 --> 06:43.066
I'd like you
to meet little Billy.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.100
Hey, kiddos!

06:44.133 --> 06:46.016
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!

06:46.050 --> 06:51.183
Dexter: And Billy,
I'd like you to meet
Becky and Gwen.

06:51.216 --> 06:52.100
Hi.
Hi.

06:52.133 --> 06:53.333
Billy: Pleased
to meet ya.

06:53.366 --> 06:56.300
Dexter: They're
the two, bill.

07:00.216 --> 07:01.183
Even?

07:01.216 --> 07:02.116
Even.

07:02.150 --> 07:03.216
Hey! No, wait!

07:03.250 --> 07:05.383
I never got
my pencil back!

07:05.416 --> 07:07.033
Pencil?

07:07.066 --> 07:09.350
You know, you raked
it in right before
I found you.

07:09.383 --> 07:12.066
Oh! Uh...That wasn't
a licorice stick?

07:12.100 --> 07:15.133
Licorice! Mmm.

07:15.166 --> 07:19.316
[Laughing]

07:24.233 --> 07:26.050
The justice friends!

07:26.083 --> 07:29.100
3 of earth's mightiest heroes!

07:30.016 --> 07:32.150
Joining forces under one roof

07:32.183 --> 07:36.133

of everyday life!

08:06.183 --> 08:08.066
Hey,
puppet pal clem.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.133
I just heard
a funny joke.

08:10.166 --> 08:11.266
Do you want
to hear it?

08:11.300 --> 08:13.250
Lay it on me,
puppet pal Mitch.

08:13.283 --> 08:18.316
Mitch: What do you get
when you cross a zebra
and a trench coat?

08:18.350 --> 08:20.016
Clem: Hey,
I do not know.

08:20.050 --> 08:24.050
What do you get
when you cross a zebra
and a trench coat?

08:24.083 --> 08:26.066
A bonk on the head.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.133
[Krunk laughing]

08:28.166 --> 08:29.133
I don't get it.

08:29.166 --> 08:30.333
Why, of course
you don't.

08:30.366 --> 08:34.083
You've gone dumb
from being bonked
on the head too much.

08:34.116 --> 08:35.150
Why, I'd be dumb, too,

08:35.183 --> 08:37.066
if I was bonked
on the head
as much as--

08:37.100 --> 08:40.083
[krunk laughing]

08:42.200 --> 08:44.266
Major glory! Val halen!

08:44.300 --> 08:46.066
Yes, krunk?

08:46.100 --> 08:48.183
On the TV,
puppet pal Mitch,

08:48.216 --> 08:50.216
he came up
to puppet pal clem,

08:50.250 --> 08:52.116
and guess what
he did!

08:52.150 --> 08:54.100
Oh, um, let me see...

08:54.133 --> 08:56.350
Oh, I know. Did he, um...

08:56.383 --> 08:58.383
Bonk him on the head?

08:58.416 --> 09:01.016
Yes. It was funny.

09:01.050 --> 09:02.050
I'll bet.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.300
Look, krunk. You've
been sitting there,

09:03.333 --> 09:07.000
watching that
TV puppet pals marathon
for the past<i>4 days.</i>

09:07.033 --> 09:10.100
Aren't you even
in the least bit tired?

09:10.133 --> 09:11.200
No.

09:11.233 --> 09:13.133
Well, val halen and I
have had enough.

09:13.166 --> 09:16.033
We're going out
to the roller rink.

09:16.066 --> 09:17.250
Again?

09:17.283 --> 09:18.450
But seriously, krunk.

09:18.483 --> 09:21.333
Try and get some sleep, hmm?

09:21.366 --> 09:24.033
Sleep, schmeep.

09:24.066 --> 09:25.283
Schmeep?

09:25.316 --> 09:26.466
Sheep!

09:28.016 --> 09:29.050
One...

[Snoring]

09:38.033 --> 09:39.333
Well, come on.

09:39.366 --> 09:40.400
Huh?

09:40.433 --> 09:42.233
The masters are waiting.
We're late as it is.

09:42.266 --> 09:44.350
You did remember
your toothbrush,
didn't you?

09:44.383 --> 09:47.350
Good. You won't
need it.

09:47.383 --> 09:49.183
Well, come on.

09:51.350 --> 09:53.100
Bonk, bonk, bonk.

09:53.133 --> 09:55.150
Duh, come in.

09:55.300 --> 09:56.433
Welcome, infragible krunk.

09:56.466 --> 10:01.250
Welcome to
the puppet pal palace.

10:04.033 --> 10:06.100
Krunk: Wow!

10:09.033 --> 10:09.466
Krunk: Wait.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.016
The puppet pal
palace, you mean?

10:13.050 --> 10:14.200
Bonk on the head!

10:14.233 --> 10:15.150
Oh, boy!

10:15.183 --> 10:18.000
But how do krunk
get up there?

10:18.033 --> 10:19.300
Mitch: Up where?

10:19.333 --> 10:22.066
[Laughing]

10:22.100 --> 10:24.150
But seriously,
krunk, welcome!

10:24.183 --> 10:27.300
Uh, krunk can't believe
it really you.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.383
In the fleece!

10:28.416 --> 10:31.466
Say, krunk,
would you like
to hear a joke?

10:32.000 --> 10:32.416
Would I!

10:32.450 --> 10:34.150
Ok.

10:36.216 --> 10:38.183
Hey,
puppet pal clem,

10:38.216 --> 10:40.250
can you guess
what day it is?

10:40.283 --> 10:43.050
Uh, is it
bonk day?

10:43.083 --> 10:44.350
Yes, it is.

10:44.383 --> 10:45.383
[Laughing]

10:45.416 --> 10:48.250
You liked
that one,
did you?

10:48.283 --> 10:50.483
[Laughing]

10:51.016 --> 10:53.050
Ok, krunk. It wasn't
that funny.

10:53.083 --> 10:56.000
[Deep laughter]

11:03.383 --> 11:05.233
Krunk!

11:05.266 --> 11:06.366
Relax!

11:06.400 --> 11:10.233
Ok. But, hey.
Krunk want to be
a puppet pal, too.

11:10.266 --> 11:12.033
Ok. Whatever!

11:12.066 --> 11:15.300
Oh, boy!
Krunk love you guys!

11:16.316 --> 11:19.450
Mitch: Oh, krunk.
This is stupid.

11:19.483 --> 11:22.200
Krunk: It'll be funny.

11:24.283 --> 11:26.433
Hey,
puppet pal clem.

11:26.466 --> 11:29.466
Hey, puppet pal
Mitch.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.433
Oh, look! Here comes
our new bestest friend,

11:34.466 --> 11:36.066
puppet pal krunk.

11:36.100 --> 11:40.033
Clem & Mitch:
Hey, puppet pal krunk.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.166
Hey, puppet pal Mitch!

11:42.200 --> 11:44.400
Hey, puppet pal clem!

11:44.433 --> 11:47.000
Puppet pal clem,
do you mind

11:47.033 --> 11:50.116
if I put this golf ball
on your head?

11:50.150 --> 11:52.233
No. Go right ahead.

11:52.266 --> 11:57.450
Ok. Now,
I have a question,
puppet pal clem.

11:57.483 --> 12:00.083
What is 2 plus 2?

12:00.116 --> 12:02.433
Duh, is it
bonk on the head?

12:02.466 --> 12:05.116
No, it's...

12:05.150 --> 12:07.050
Fore!

12:07.083 --> 12:09.400
Oh, you see, krunk.
I told you this
was stupid.

12:09.433 --> 12:11.133
Wait!

12:12.416 --> 12:14.116
[Bonk]

12:15.350 --> 12:17.366
[Laughing]

12:17.400 --> 12:20.200
You think
that's funny?

12:20.233 --> 12:21.383
What's wrong with you?

12:21.416 --> 12:24.216
Can't you see how complicated
and contrived that joke was?

12:24.250 --> 12:27.450
And another thing.
Why am I using a golf club?

12:27.483 --> 12:30.083
I'm supposed to be using
my bonk stick.

12:30.116 --> 12:33.233
Bonk stick equals comedy.
Golf club equals not comedy.

12:33.266 --> 12:35.133
Being a puppet pal
is a serious bonkness.

12:35.166 --> 12:37.350
What do you think,
I just hop out of
my bonk bed,

12:37.383 --> 12:41.350
eat some bonkfast, and
then bonk clem on the
head all day? Well--

12:41.383 --> 12:43.366
major glory: Hey!
Quit bonking our friend!

12:43.400 --> 12:44.250
What?

12:44.283 --> 12:46.066
Our justice friend!

12:46.100 --> 12:48.466
Oh, no!
The justice puppets!

12:49.000 --> 12:50.483
Let's bonk 'em!

13:03.450 --> 13:05.133
Ok. Ok!

13:05.166 --> 13:08.166
Ok! We give up.
You win.

13:08.200 --> 13:13.333
Major glory!
Val halen!
Wait! Then who...

13:16.366 --> 13:18.350
What's going on here?

13:18.383 --> 13:22.400
Well, krunk, we thought
you were spending too
much time watching TV

13:22.433 --> 13:24.433
and not enough time
being a superhero,

13:24.466 --> 13:28.483
so we tried to turn you
against your so-called
funny friends.

13:29.016 --> 13:31.283
But you didn't,
'cause we came,

13:31.316 --> 13:34.016
we saw,
and we bonkered.

13:34.050 --> 13:37.083
And you call
yourselves
superheroes.

13:37.116 --> 13:38.133
You want a piece
of me, junior?

13:38.166 --> 13:41.316
You're bonking
up the wrong
tree, buddy.

13:41.350 --> 13:42.366
[Screaming]

13:42.400 --> 13:44.400
You both driving krunk

13:44.433 --> 13:46.166
bonkers!

13:47.066 --> 13:50.166
Ah, it was all a dream.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.133
[Zebra braying]

13:51.166 --> 13:53.366
I wouldn't say that.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.183
Aah!

13:55.216 --> 13:57.116
Hey, puppet pal clem.

13:57.150 --> 13:58.366
Yeah, puppet pal Mitch.

13:58.400 --> 14:02.266
Mitch: That's the last time
we stay up watching

14:02.300 --> 14:04.433
the 4-day
justice friends marathon.

14:04.466 --> 14:06.483
Clem: Mm-hmm.
You said it.

14:07.016 --> 14:08.433
Good night, puppet pal clem.

14:08.466 --> 14:10.466
Good night,
puppet pal Mitch.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.083
Puppet pal clem,
there's a spider in your bed!

14:15.116 --> 14:16.316
Bonk!

14:29.316 --> 14:30.400
Ah!

14:30.433 --> 14:34.383
Time now
for a nice sit.

14:38.050 --> 14:41.416
Hey! What do
I look like?
A chair?

14:41.450 --> 14:42.283
No.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.466
"I" looks like this.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.016
Summer camp.

15:04.050 --> 15:05.466
A grim time for every child,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.283
when in the midst
of the gleeful summer months,

15:09.316 --> 15:13.116
he is torn away
from his comfortable home,

15:13.150 --> 15:14.216
and forced into savagery.

15:14.250 --> 15:17.183
These poor souls
live in primitive hovels

15:17.216 --> 15:21.066
and struggle to maintain
even human decency.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.450
It is horror.

15:22.483 --> 15:25.183
What are you
so happy about,
Dexter?

15:25.216 --> 15:26.433
I thought
you hated camp.

15:26.466 --> 15:29.433
I do.
But I am not going
to regular camp.

15:29.466 --> 15:31.200
I am going
to a cool camp.

15:31.233 --> 15:36.000
Dexter, you wouldn't
know cool if it was
tattooed on your retina.

15:36.033 --> 15:37.100
First of all,

15:37.133 --> 15:39.316
I am surprised
you even know what
a retina is.

15:39.350 --> 15:43.300
Secondly, I'll bet
my camp turns out
cooler than yours.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.416
It's a deal!

15:44.450 --> 15:46.250
I don't know
how to tell you this,

15:46.283 --> 15:48.333
but I'm going
to space camp.

15:48.366 --> 15:51.033
Space? Been there,
done that.

15:51.066 --> 15:54.300
I am going to a fully
operational modern
agricultural environment,

15:54.333 --> 15:58.133
complete with a high-tech,
super cyber techno
highway gigabyte.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.433
Oh, yeah. A farm
with a tractor.

16:00.466 --> 16:02.316
They have more
than a tractor!

16:02.350 --> 16:03.250
Ooh!

16:03.283 --> 16:05.433
I think that's
my bus coming.

16:07.016 --> 16:08.400
Cool,
huh, Dexter?

16:08.433 --> 16:10.150
No.

16:13.433 --> 16:16.483
[Horse trotting]

16:17.016 --> 16:22.350
Kids' voices: Yeah! Farm camp!

16:22.383 --> 16:26.000
[Horse trotting]

16:33.083 --> 16:34.350
[Horse neighs]

16:35.400 --> 16:36.450
You Dexter?

16:36.483 --> 16:37.333
Yes.

16:37.366 --> 16:39.283
No time
to chat, son.

16:39.316 --> 16:40.250
Get in. Let's go.

16:40.283 --> 16:42.083
I am waiting
for the bus to camp.

16:42.116 --> 16:46.016
If you need directional
assistance, I will be
happy to help.

16:46.050 --> 16:47.400
Son, don't play games.

16:47.433 --> 16:50.233
Get in. We got
a long trip back.

16:50.266 --> 16:53.133
You mean<i>this</i>
the bus to camp?

16:53.166 --> 16:54.333
Wouldn't you know it?

16:54.366 --> 16:55.483
[Sighs]

17:15.266 --> 17:17.100
Man: Wake up, little one.

17:17.133 --> 17:18.383
We're here.

17:18.416 --> 17:21.050
[Yawns]

17:21.083 --> 17:24.000
Finally. I could use
a bit of, uh,

17:24.033 --> 17:26.116
civilization?

17:26.150 --> 17:27.100
Man: Come on,

17:27.133 --> 17:29.450
let me introduce you
to the family.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.350
My name's Jebediah.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.366
This here's my very plain wife.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.033
I just call her wife.

17:37.066 --> 17:39.200
Down there's little Ezra

17:39.233 --> 17:42.216
and his sister--
they're the children--

17:42.250 --> 17:46.433
and our senior citizen,
good old grandma.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.016
She don't move much,

17:48.050 --> 17:51.200
but she makes one heck
of a scarecrow.

17:51.233 --> 17:52.216
Grandma: Caw!

17:52.250 --> 17:55.150
We strive for simplicity
here, Dexter.

17:55.183 --> 18:01.283
We do without all
those modern conveniences
you take for granted.

18:01.316 --> 18:03.466
Like neural net computers?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.416
Like plumbing.

18:06.083 --> 18:08.466
Just give our way
a chance, Dexter.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.266
You'll grow
to like it in time.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.016
We have.

18:18.100 --> 18:22.133
Welcome to space camp.
We know you'll
enjoy it here.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.116
Whee!

18:24.150 --> 18:26.200
Dee Dee: This is fun!

18:26.233 --> 18:27.366
Dexter: Day one,

18:27.400 --> 18:29.166
I have seen the wasteland.

18:29.200 --> 18:33.433
There is no technology here,
only brute force.

18:33.466 --> 18:35.283
But I have a plan.

18:35.316 --> 18:41.050
In a few days, I should
have everything I'll need
to show them the light.

18:41.083 --> 18:44.033
So, Dexter,
how do you
like it here?

18:44.066 --> 18:47.266
It's boring!
What do you
do for fun?

18:47.300 --> 18:50.116
Fun? What is
this fun?

18:50.150 --> 18:53.000
You know,
pleasurable
activity.

18:53.033 --> 18:56.183
Oh, that!
We have that!

18:56.216 --> 18:57.483
Come on!

18:58.016 --> 19:00.233
There she is!

19:03.066 --> 19:04.250
You can go first.

19:04.283 --> 19:06.100
Come on, Dexter.
Churn!

19:06.133 --> 19:11.000
It's, how do you say, fun!
Isn't that the best?

19:11.033 --> 19:12.166
[Grumbling]

19:12.200 --> 19:15.350
Dee Dee, this will test
your g-force tolerance.

19:15.383 --> 19:16.150
Whatever!

19:16.183 --> 19:19.216
Man: 3, 2, 1...

19:19.250 --> 19:21.433
Whoo!

19:21.466 --> 19:25.383
Marvelous. She's
magnifique.
Exquisite.

19:25.416 --> 19:28.433
Wife: Children,
supper time.

19:38.350 --> 19:42.400
[Chewing noisily]

[Gulping]

19:49.333 --> 19:50.200
[Burp]

19:50.233 --> 19:53.100
Mmm! Now that's good eatin'.

19:53.133 --> 20:00.133
Yes, sir. Finger lickin' good.

20:02.183 --> 20:03.233
[Laughing nervously]

20:03.266 --> 20:05.333
Excuse me.

20:05.366 --> 20:08.316
I have gone 8 days
without science.

20:08.350 --> 20:12.350
I can feel my mind
slowly slipping away.

20:12.383 --> 20:14.300
But I must hold on,

20:14.333 --> 20:18.116
for the plan
is almost complete.

20:20.083 --> 20:23.133
Jebediah: Oh, my candle's
burned out.

20:23.166 --> 20:24.333
Hey, Jebediah!

20:24.366 --> 20:26.316
Aah!

20:26.350 --> 20:27.466
My eyes!

20:28.000 --> 20:30.466
Look! I made
a potato-powered light,
just for you!

20:31.000 --> 20:34.183
Evil! I'll be havin'
none of this!

20:34.216 --> 20:36.266
You must be punished!

20:37.266 --> 20:39.433
And it was evil,
I tell you.

20:39.466 --> 20:42.166
It glowed
an evil glow.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.366
He's a bad seed.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.316
He needs
to be punished.

20:45.350 --> 20:46.333
Wife: But how?

20:46.366 --> 20:49.216
Well, first
we heat up
some tar...

20:49.250 --> 20:50.466
Dexter, thinking:
Oh, Dexter,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.283
what have you
gotten yourself into?

20:53.316 --> 20:55.316
These people are going to,

20:55.350 --> 20:57.133
gulp, hurt you.

20:57.166 --> 20:59.450
And they're
in the middle of nowhere!

20:59.483 --> 21:03.183
I can only hope
for a miracle.

21:04.383 --> 21:05.283
Huh?

21:05.316 --> 21:07.033
Hi, Dexter!

21:07.066 --> 21:08.066
Dee Dee!

21:08.383 --> 21:11.016
She came
from the sky.

21:11.050 --> 21:12.266
It must be the...

21:12.300 --> 21:16.050
The magical crop fairy!

21:16.083 --> 21:18.200
Boy, am I glad
to see you!

21:18.233 --> 21:20.016
These people
are crazy!

21:20.050 --> 21:21.150
But they dress
so cool!

21:21.183 --> 21:26.083
The magical crop fairy
has given us her blessing.

21:26.116 --> 21:28.333
This calls for
a celebration.

21:28.366 --> 21:31.400
I'll say. I mean, caw!

21:31.433 --> 21:32.366
[Laughing]

21:32.400 --> 21:34.300

You win the bet!
