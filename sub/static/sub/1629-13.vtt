NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:04.255 --> 00:05.290
-(GASPS)
-What happened?

00:05.756 --> 00:07.496
A protection spell.

00:07.592 --> 00:08.581
Undo it.

00:08.676 --> 00:09.836
Someone hijacked it.

00:09.927 --> 00:11.963
Who? Who's in there?

00:12.096 --> 00:13.802
The Queen may be evil,

00:14.724 --> 00:16.589
but I'm wicked.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.675
And wicked always wins.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.511
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

00:22.607 --> 00:24.598
Look at all her things.

00:24.692 --> 00:28.776
Onyx, black pearl, diamond...

00:30.531 --> 00:32.863
A family could live off what this is worth.

00:32.950 --> 00:33.985
(CLATTERS)

00:34.785 --> 00:37.367
And she just left it all behind.
(CHUCKLES)

00:38.831 --> 00:39.911
(SQUAWKS)

00:41.459 --> 00:43.495
Such pretty things.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.997
A|| wasted on her.

00:52.511 --> 00:53.637
Ah...

00:53.888 --> 00:56.049
Now, this could work.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.220
(WHOOSH)

00:58.184 --> 00:59.594
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

01:00.186 --> 01:02.677
Now that's how you wear a dress.

01:02.772 --> 01:03.932
(SQUAWKS)

01:05.441 --> 01:07.557
I know I look lovely.

01:07.652 --> 01:10.940
Now go find the Evil Queen
and let her know that I'm here.

01:11.030 --> 01:14.522
And, no, there's no need to be gentle.

01:15.660 --> 01:16.820
(SQUAWKS)

01:34.595 --> 01:35.926
(HORSE WHINNIES)

01:37.723 --> 01:39.805
Seems like old times, doesn't it?

01:39.892 --> 01:43.009
Except not running from Regina
but with her.

01:43.104 --> 01:45.516
She's changed.
I have to believe for the better.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.107
I hope it sticks.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.352
But regardless,
she doesn't look too good.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.354
If she hadn't tried to hurt us
so many times,

01:51.445 --> 01:53.185
I might be worried about her.

01:53.281 --> 01:54.862
I'll talk to her.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.782
You ready to make camp soon, Regina?

02:05.584 --> 02:08.166
You're thinking about Henry,
aren't you?

02:08.254 --> 02:11.291
I'm always thinking about Henry.

02:11.382 --> 02:13.247
But I was also thinking

02:13.384 --> 02:16.547
there are tunnels
that run under the castle.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.379
They may run beneath the spell.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.304
Which means we can sneak
an army inside.

02:21.392 --> 02:22.757
An army would be detected.

02:22.893 --> 02:26.181
So how do the tunnels help us?

02:26.272 --> 02:28.263
Because it can get me inside.

02:28.399 --> 02:32.108
And if I can get inside,
then I can lower the shield.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.272
Then you can send in your army.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.567
(SHRIEKING)

02:41.912 --> 02:43.072
Incoming!

02:45.750 --> 02:47.081
-Papa!
-Roland!

02:52.548 --> 02:54.254
Not so fast!

03:04.643 --> 03:06.429
See? Not so scary.

03:07.146 --> 03:09.387
Now you have a new toy.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.143
Thank you.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.024
EMMA: Okay, Henry's asleep upstairs.

03:18.115 --> 03:22.074
If he wakes up, you two
are helping me with the case, okay?

03:22.161 --> 03:24.903
So what the hell happened here?
I mean, besides the obvious.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.658
We don't know.

03:26.791 --> 03:28.782
We watched you drive over
the town line with Henry.

03:28.918 --> 03:31.751
Regina started to cast her spell to
take us all back to the enchanted forest,

03:31.837 --> 03:33.498
and then,

03:33.631 --> 03:35.087
everything went black.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.290
The next thing we remember
is waking up in our beds

03:37.426 --> 03:40.213
like it was any other morning
in Storybrooke.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.295
Except it clearly wasn't.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.343
Almost harvest time,
but you can't remember the planting.

03:45.476 --> 03:46.465
It's bad luck, mate.

03:46.602 --> 03:49.344
Clearly, a year has passed.
lwas in New York, I know that it did.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.890
And we don't know
where the hell we were.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.437
We don't even know
if we left Storybrooke.

03:52.525 --> 03:55.358
Aye, you did. I was with you all.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.067
In the enchanted forest?

03:57.154 --> 03:58.860
Regina's spell brought us back.

03:58.989 --> 04:02.026
We spent a brief time with a prince
and princess named Phillip and Aurora.

04:02.827 --> 04:06.490
But I wasn't feeling the community spirit
so I ventured off on my own.

04:06.622 --> 04:09.989
Last I saw of you lot, you were making
your way to Regina's castle.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.992
And now you're cursed.
Why doesn't that surprise me?

04:14.672 --> 04:16.378
Regina seems as clueless
as the rest of us.

04:16.507 --> 04:17.997
I'm not sure she was involved in this.

04:18.134 --> 04:19.840
-So she says.
-DAV|D: I don't understand.

04:19.969 --> 04:22.005
If you left the enchanted forest
before the curse,

04:22.138 --> 04:25.096
how did you know to find Emma
and come to Storybrooke?

04:25.182 --> 04:29.801
As I was sailing the realms, a bird
landed on my ship's wheel with a note

04:29.895 --> 04:33.479
instructing me to retrieve Emma
and bring her back here.

04:33.566 --> 04:37.525
There was a small vial
of memory potion tied to its leg.

04:37.653 --> 04:38.859
Who sent it?

04:38.988 --> 04:40.899
I assumed you did.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.410
Message via bird.
It does sound like you.

04:45.494 --> 04:46.529
(DOOR OPENS)

04:47.371 --> 04:48.907
-What is it?
-We lost another one.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.290
We're down to five now.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.365
Four, actually. Bashful's not answering.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.877
Wait, what is going on?

04:54.003 --> 04:55.368
Thank God, you're back, sister.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.540
It's not just our memories
that are missing.

04:57.673 --> 05:00.289
Ever since we woke up,
people have begun disappearing.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.796
Whoever cursed us
is picking us off one-by-one.

05:02.887 --> 05:04.172
Who exactly is missing?

05:04.263 --> 05:06.754
Aside from those dwarfs, we're not sure.

05:06.891 --> 05:08.802
There's been a lot of confusion
over the past few days.

05:08.893 --> 05:10.599
It's been hard to keep track of everyone.

05:11.896 --> 05:13.511
Wait. Neal, is he here?

05:15.191 --> 05:16.476
Well, we haven't found him yet.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.228
So he might have been taken, too?

05:18.360 --> 05:20.442
-Smart money's on yes.
-Leroy.

05:21.447 --> 05:24.735
He'll turn up, Swan. He always does.

05:24.867 --> 05:25.856
Some folks are starting to set up camp

05:25.951 --> 05:27.862
in the woods at the edge of town.
Neal might be there.

05:27.953 --> 05:30.410
Or he may not have gotten
swept up in the curse at all.

05:32.041 --> 05:35.909
There's only one way
we're going to figure all this out.

05:36.045 --> 05:37.455
We need to get your memories back.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.954
How are we going to do that?

05:40.716 --> 05:44.049
By figuring out who took them
in the first place.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.183
What the hell was that thing?

05:57.274 --> 05:59.981
The same kind of monster that
attacked us on ourjourney here.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.522
If I didn't know better, I'd say it
looked an awful lot like a monkey.

06:02.613 --> 06:03.648
A monkey with wings?

06:03.781 --> 06:06.523
Yes. That's exactly what it is.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.482
Okay. You're acting like that's normal.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.950
Actually it is.

06:10.079 --> 06:11.694
But not here.

06:11.789 --> 06:14.246
There's only one land
that has creatures like that.

06:14.333 --> 06:17.291
I've read about it. Oz.

06:17.962 --> 06:20.795
Oz? That's a real place?

06:20.923 --> 06:23.130
The bookworm's right.
It's quite real.

06:23.259 --> 06:26.171
And if our simian friend
is any indication,

06:26.303 --> 06:30.717
then I think we know exactly
who's taking up residence in our castle.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.469
The Wicked Witch.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.886
We talking East or West?

06:36.981 --> 06:39.347
Does it matter?
Neither one sounds good.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.395
One you drop a house on.
The other you toss a bucket of water at.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.101
So, Regina, what exactly
are we up against,

06:44.196 --> 06:45.982
besides green skin and a pointy hat?

06:46.115 --> 06:47.104
What did you do to her?

06:47.199 --> 06:49.861
This time? Nothing. Never met her.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.243
This isn't a personal vendetta?
Shocking.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.821
Okay, then, Oz aside,
we stick to the original plan.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.531
Arm up. Then attack.

06:57.668 --> 06:59.533
Assuming you can get the shield down.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.286
You don't need to worry about me.

07:02.381 --> 07:03.621
SNOW WHITE: I'm coming with you.

07:03.716 --> 07:05.627
No. This is a one-woman job.

07:05.718 --> 07:08.255
What? Against the Wicked Witch?

07:08.345 --> 07:11.428
She has flying monkeys,
who knows what else.

07:11.515 --> 07:15.224
I don't care if the Lollipop Guild
is protecting her.

07:15.352 --> 07:18.014
I can lower that shield on my own.

07:19.690 --> 07:22.682
Then we'll be waiting for you
on the other side.

07:32.870 --> 07:36.704
Here you go, Hen... Young man.
A nice hot cocoa.

07:37.583 --> 07:38.698
Hey.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.249
The cinnamon, how did you know?

07:42.087 --> 07:45.545
Uh, lucky guess.
You have got a cinnamon kind of face.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.006
(DOOR BELLS RING)

07:49.386 --> 07:51.718
Oh, Henry,
this is David and Mary Margaret.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.472
Are you helping my mom with the case?

07:56.727 --> 07:58.763
(WHISPERING)
Or are they the ones who jumped bail?

07:58.896 --> 07:59.931
-(MARY LAUGHS)
-Oh, no, they are...

08:01.649 --> 08:02.934
They're just old friends.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.102
Friends from where?

08:04.234 --> 08:05.735
-Here.
-Phoenix.

08:07.905 --> 08:10.066
Well, Phoenix, and then here.

08:10.157 --> 08:14.275
But I thought you were only in Phoenix
for being in that place.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.788
Right. We were cell mates.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.913
Really? What were you in for?

08:21.251 --> 08:22.912
Banditry.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.754
People make mistakes.

08:27.883 --> 08:32.593
The important thing is
to find a way to keep moving on.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.594
Did you know my dad?

08:35.307 --> 08:38.014
Should we order? Let's order.

08:38.102 --> 08:39.091
(DISH SHATTERS)

(REGINA GASPS)

08:45.317 --> 08:46.306
Oh...

08:46.610 --> 08:50.444
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

08:51.115 --> 08:53.481
Oh, um, that's okay.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.323
Regina.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.118
Regina, we need to talk.

08:58.789 --> 08:59.949
Come on.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.209
(BREATH ES SHAKILY)

09:07.673 --> 09:09.413
(QUIETLY) He looked right through me.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.373
Because he doesn't remember you.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.925
But you clearly do.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.092
Why are you here?

09:15.180 --> 09:18.638
Storybrooke. A new curse.
Missing year. Why do you think?

09:18.767 --> 09:21.224
No, what I mean is,
how did you know to come back?

09:21.311 --> 09:24.269
I gave you and Henry a new life,
new memories.

09:24.356 --> 09:25.971
Hook found me.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.564
Gave me a potion that
made me remember.

09:27.651 --> 09:28.686
There wasn't enough for Henry.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.775
Oh, how convenient.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.400
Look, I didn't cast this curse,
if that's what you're thinking.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.901
The thought did cross my mind.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.403
Why would I do this?

09:37.494 --> 09:39.655
Why would I erase
an entire year of my life?

09:39.788 --> 09:40.994
Maybe it was a bad year for you.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.455
Maybe this curse was your way
of getting me to bring Henry back here.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.282
With no memory of me?

09:45.377 --> 09:46.492
If I wanted my son back,

09:46.628 --> 09:49.415
do you think I'd put myself
through this kind of torture?

09:49.506 --> 09:51.997
I cast curses to hurt other people.
Not myself.

09:52.134 --> 09:54.090
Maybe so.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.009
But I need to start crossing people
off the list.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.878
How?

09:58.015 --> 10:00.301
By walking around and using
your superpower on everyone?

10:01.018 --> 10:02.849
You got a better idea?

10:10.319 --> 10:11.855
I've never seen a bow like that.

10:11.987 --> 10:14.820
Its aim is truer
than any I've seen without magic.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.398
-Where did you get it?
-The store.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.158
And you procured it with what?

10:21.872 --> 10:23.328
You stole it?

10:23.415 --> 10:26.407
The proprietor looked rich,
and we're poor here.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.283
We gotta eat.

Speaking of eating, I see dinner!

are in this land.

(LAUGHTER)

10:40.724 --> 10:45.093
Only missed by a feather's length.
Seems that bow has improved your aim.

John!

11:21.557 --> 11:22.546
This...

11:23.225 --> 11:24.806
This is where he was taken.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.721
I wouldn't step over that line
if I were you.

11:26.812 --> 11:29.849
You think Little John was carried away
'cause he attempted to cross that line?

11:29.940 --> 11:31.976
Yeah, makes sense. The dwarfs
were out checking the line to see

11:32.067 --> 11:34.353
if anyone was coming or going
when they disappeared.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.695
What exactly took Little John?

11:35.779 --> 11:38.691
We didn't get a good look,
some manner of beast with wings.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.023
That sounds a lot like the monster
that attacked me in New York.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.608
You mean the monster
you were gonna marry?

11:45.455 --> 11:48.242
Well, did you just miss the part
where I said "monster"?

Right. Them. And run a search grid,

11:57.134 --> 11:59.090
and see if you can find
any sign of the missing guy.

You're notjoining us, Swan?

12:00.929 --> 12:02.430
Not yet. Regina was right.

12:02.514 --> 12:03.720
I'm not gonna figure out
who's behind this curse

12:05.100 --> 12:06.306

I'm gonna talk to everybody.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.266
I know that you're frightened
and confused,

12:16.361 --> 12:17.692
but I need you to listen.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.813
Is it true? Is there some kind of monster
keeping us from leaving town?

12:20.949 --> 12:21.938
Is that what happened to my brothers?

12:22.034 --> 12:24.741
Yes, we believe that people
are being abducted

12:24.828 --> 12:26.443
as they approach the town line.

12:26.538 --> 12:29.029
So we're trapped here? Again?

12:29.166 --> 12:30.155
It's no different than last time.

12:30.292 --> 12:31.953
Last time, we lost our memories.

12:32.044 --> 12:34.126
This time we get dragged
into the woods.

12:34.212 --> 12:37.340
Do you know who cursed us?
And why they want us here?

12:37.466 --> 12:38.672
I'm working on it.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.131
But it's hard to figure out
who cast a curse

12:40.218 --> 12:41.469
when no one remembers the last year.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.930
Who? Isn't it obvious?

12:44.014 --> 12:45.424
Do you remember something?

12:45.515 --> 12:47.426
Who cast the last curse?

12:47.517 --> 12:49.382
Who knows how to use it?

12:49.519 --> 12:53.262
Who's the only one who ever did
anything like this before?

You expect us to believe that?

13:04.743 --> 13:05.903
It's the truth.

13:06.036 --> 13:08.652
This curse has your fingerprints
all over it.

13:08.747 --> 13:11.329
And you did take away our memories
once before.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.451
You still have your big house.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.578
You think I care about my house?

13:14.711 --> 13:16.963
About my job?
About any of these things?

13:17.047 --> 13:19.038
Regina, please, just tell us the truth.
We'll understand.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.085
Speak for yourself.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.879
I am telling the truth.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.003
If I had done this,
there's one thing I'd have right now.

13:26.098 --> 13:27.213
My son.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.805
Yeah, you're not getting
anywhere near him

13:28.892 --> 13:30.553
until I get to the bottom
of what's going on here.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.720
So now you're siding with the rabble?

I thought we'd been through this.

stayed with the others.

I sealed it with blood magic.
I'm the only one who can open it.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.656
Clearly not.

is a formidable foe.

It must have been important
for you to seal it by blood.

Yes. What I meant was
who was it built for?

19:44.434 --> 19:45.719

19:47.771 --> 19:50.808
Like you, I've lost people I care about.

you grabbed Roland back there.

Clearly, you have the touch of a mother.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.456
I do.

He's not with us on this trek.

If the Wicked Witch is powerful enough
to break blood magic,

23:28.491 --> 23:30.732
John, I'm here. We've got you.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.943
-l've never seen a bite like that before.
-Me neither.

23:33.037 --> 23:36.529
Okay, help me get him up.
We've got to get him some help.

23:40.837 --> 23:43.453
Make yourself useful. Keep watch.

23:45.883 --> 23:46.872
(DOOR CLOSES)

23:51.472 --> 23:52.507
What is that?

23:53.808 --> 23:55.173
Nothing that concerns you.

23:59.731 --> 24:02.689
I won't ask you again. What is that?

24:03.735 --> 24:06.351
How dare you threaten me
in my own castle!

24:07.530 --> 24:08.815
(CHOKING)

24:09.365 --> 24:11.321
(STRAINING)
Even if you choke the life out of me,

24:11.409 --> 24:13.991
this arrow will still leave my bow.

24:14.078 --> 24:15.818
And, trust me, I never miss.

24:15.913 --> 24:18.871
Now, what manner of dark potion
are you making?

24:20.627 --> 24:21.616
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

24:22.128 --> 24:23.117
(GASPING)

24:23.421 --> 24:25.161
A sleeping curse.

24:28.176 --> 24:29.791
The kind you used on Snow White?

24:29.886 --> 24:32.377
That spell came from Maleficent.

24:32.513 --> 24:35.596
I finally learned
how to make one of my own.

24:35.725 --> 24:39.183
This spell, this is why
you wanted to come to the castle?

24:39.270 --> 24:42.228
Ingredients like these
are hard to come by.

24:42.357 --> 24:43.722
Especially when you have Snow White

24:43.858 --> 24:46.440
breathing down your neck
every second of the day.

24:46.569 --> 24:49.481
That was your plan,
to use it on the Witch?

24:49.572 --> 24:50.812
The Witch?

24:50.907 --> 24:53.023
I don't care about her.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.402
(TINKLING)

24:54.869 --> 24:56.450
Then who do you plan to use it on?

24:56.537 --> 24:57.697
Don't worry.

24:59.082 --> 25:01.368
No one you'll miss.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.915
No one anyone will miss.

25:10.635 --> 25:12.250
This is about your son, isn't it?

25:15.098 --> 25:16.588
I can't let you do this.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.885
Then it's a good thing
you don't have a say in the matter.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.182
(WHOOSH)

25:23.815 --> 25:25.521
I know how you feel, Regina.

25:25.608 --> 25:26.939
I doubt that.

25:27.068 --> 25:29.184
When I lost my wife,

25:29.278 --> 25:32.190
I felt that there was no reason to go on.

25:32.281 --> 25:35.023
But then I found one, my son.

25:35.118 --> 25:37.780
That's where you and I are different.

25:40.623 --> 25:43.285
I already lost Henry.

25:43.418 --> 25:46.831
I already lost the only thing I care about.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.204
That doesn't mean
you won't find a new reason.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.505
We all get a second chance, Regina.

25:51.634 --> 25:54.467
You just have to open your eyes
to see it.

25:54.595 --> 25:57.257
It's too bad mine will be closed.

25:58.933 --> 26:01.595
So that's it? You just want to give up?

26:01.686 --> 26:03.472
This isn't an end.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.515
It's an eternal middle.

26:06.524 --> 26:10.984
This curse can be broken
by the only true love in my life,

26:12.488 --> 26:15.980
and the only reason
I would even want to wake,

26:17.535 --> 26:19.321
my son.

26:19.454 --> 26:22.161
Regina, listen to me.
This is a mistake!

26:22.290 --> 26:25.373
Don't worry. I'll keep my word.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.241
I'll lower the protection spell

26:27.336 --> 26:29.998
so that Snow and Charming
can be victorious.

26:33.134 --> 26:34.374
But then...

26:36.345 --> 26:38.381
Then I go to sleep.

26:38.514 --> 26:39.549
(GRUNTS)

26:42.185 --> 26:43.300
(SCRAPING)

26:52.069 --> 26:53.195
Did it work?

26:53.321 --> 26:55.687
There's only one way to find out.

27:01.913 --> 27:03.699
Well, do you remember?

27:05.625 --> 27:06.614
(GLASS SHATTERS)

27:07.210 --> 27:09.201
Either that wall did something to you
in the past year,

27:09.337 --> 27:10.326
or I'm gonna say it didn't work.

27:10.421 --> 27:12.286
(SIGHS) I must have
missed an ingredient.

27:12.381 --> 27:13.416
Can we try again?

27:13.549 --> 27:16.757
I already used up what was left
of the potion Hook gave you.

27:16.886 --> 27:19.093
There's nothing left to replicate.

27:19.764 --> 27:20.844
(SIGHS)

27:22.767 --> 27:26.180
I can't live in this town
if Henry doesn't remember me.

27:26.896 --> 27:28.932
That's worse than any curse
I ever could have cast.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.522
What if we can still find the person
who cursed the town?

27:32.610 --> 27:36.148
Haven't you been paying attention?
I can't make any more potion.

27:36.239 --> 27:38.901
You don't have to make anything.
We can still catch the person.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.073
-How?
-We've been running a con

27:41.160 --> 27:42.275
by making this potion in secret.

27:42.411 --> 27:43.537
What if we're running the wrong con?

27:43.621 --> 27:47.910
I'm sorry. I'm not well-versed in cons.
Unlike you, I never spent time in prison.

27:48.042 --> 27:50.829
It's not something I learned in prison.
It's an old bail bonds trick.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.411
You smoke out the perp
by making them think you're on to them.

27:53.548 --> 27:54.958
How does that help us?

27:55.091 --> 27:56.251
If the person who cast the curse

27:56.384 --> 27:58.750
thought we were about
to make a memory potion...

27:58.886 --> 28:01.343
They'd want to stop us.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.637
Yes. And then, we set a trap for them
when they do.

28:03.766 --> 28:07.725
We just need to get the word out
that you're close to making all this work.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.596
I knowjust who to tell.

28:12.149 --> 28:14.105
Big news, everybody!

28:15.236 --> 28:17.192
Emma found Regina.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.612
She was holed up in her office,
working on a potion.

28:19.740 --> 28:20.775
What kind of potion?

28:20.908 --> 28:21.988
Was she going to hurt us?

28:22.118 --> 28:24.359
A memory potion.

28:24.453 --> 28:28.241
Regina says she's gonna use it
to prove that she didn't cast the curse.

28:28.332 --> 28:30.323
Like I'd drink anything she handed me.

28:30.459 --> 28:31.915
Well, somebody will!

28:33.087 --> 28:35.499
And if they remember,

28:35.631 --> 28:38.247
we'll know exactly who did this to us!

28:39.969 --> 28:41.379
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

28:51.647 --> 28:53.854
He's bradycardic. BP dropping fast.

28:53.983 --> 28:55.939
-What did this to him?
-We don't know.

28:56.027 --> 28:57.187
He's going into shock.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.106
We need to sedate him.
Fifteen milligrams of propofol.

Don't look at me. I'm a doctor, not a vet.

30:00.216 --> 30:04.710
So, do we just sit here and wait?

30:05.513 --> 30:08.755
Until the person who cast the curse
makes a move on your office.

30:11.102 --> 30:14.970
Is this really what you do for a living?

30:15.064 --> 30:17.055
Yeah. It's called a stakeout.

30:19.110 --> 30:22.147
And you don't get bored?

30:22.238 --> 30:25.605
I don't know. You find ways
to pass the time. Eat. Talk.

30:25.741 --> 30:28.073
Mostly watch, which is
what we should be doing.

30:31.789 --> 30:33.575
Does he have friends?

30:33.708 --> 30:35.744
-Does who have friends?
-Henry.

30:37.378 --> 30:40.870
Does he have any friends in New York?

30:40.965 --> 30:43.547
Yeah. He has a lot of friends.

30:43.634 --> 30:46.216
No girlfriends yet,
at least not that I know about.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.134
So, he's happy?

30:49.390 --> 30:51.096
His life is good there?

30:51.225 --> 30:52.260
Yeah.

30:53.269 --> 30:55.180
I almost didn't come back
because of that.

30:55.271 --> 30:56.932
Then why did you?

30:59.400 --> 31:02.062
Because he may not remember all this,
but I do.

31:03.738 --> 31:06.104
And I know what he would say.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.606
"A hero would come back."

31:08.701 --> 31:09.781
(SIGHS)

31:10.745 --> 31:12.701
He would say that.

31:12.788 --> 31:13.903
Are you sure
you don't want to meet him?

31:13.998 --> 31:15.488
We can just tell him
you're an old friend,

31:15.624 --> 31:18.081
like Mary Margaret and David.

31:18.169 --> 31:20.080
It would be too hard.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.457
I can't imagine...

31:24.592 --> 31:26.128
We've got them.

31:29.138 --> 31:31.845
You sure whoever's in there
can't escape?

31:31.974 --> 31:33.510
I sealed the room with a blood lock.

31:33.642 --> 31:36.224
It can keep you out.
Or it can keep you in.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.625
No matter how powerful they are.

32:05.716 --> 32:07.672
Then who are we dealing with?

33:00.563 --> 33:02.053
It's down!

33:03.524 --> 33:04.889
We move on the castle.

33:05.025 --> 33:06.401
Now!

33:30.217 --> 33:32.299
I'm sorry, Henry.

33:34.597 --> 33:37.259
Maybe one day you'll find me
and wake me up.

33:39.268 --> 33:40.553
But until then...

33:45.482 --> 33:49.066
You weren't even going to say
hello first?

33:49.153 --> 33:51.769
It's not exactly the welcome
I was expecting.

33:54.742 --> 33:57.654

None of your business.

34:08.797 --> 34:11.584
You really don't know who I am, do you?

34:11.675 --> 34:15.964
I know exactly who you are.
The Wicked Witch.

34:16.805 --> 34:17.840
Is that all?

34:17.973 --> 34:19.349
I'm not that interested.

34:19.433 --> 34:20.422
(WHOOSH)

34:20.517 --> 34:23.224
Please allow me to introduce myself.

That's my dress.

34:28.567 --> 34:29.556
Hm.

34:29.818 --> 34:33.060
I had to take it in a little bit at the hips,

34:33.155 --> 34:35.066
but it looks better on me,
don't you think?

34:35.157 --> 34:37.318
I think you never should have left Oz.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.776
You can have your castle back
if you want it that badly.

34:40.871 --> 34:43.157
I was just trying it on for size.

34:43.290 --> 34:46.202
Besides, I've already seen
everything worth seeing,

34:46.335 --> 34:48.792
your closet, the gardens,

34:48.879 --> 34:50.744
your crypt.

34:50.839 --> 34:53.000
Yes, how did you break the blood lock?

34:54.009 --> 34:54.964
I didn't.

34:55.052 --> 34:56.667
The door was open.

No one is that powerful.

Cora really never told you?

35:03.018 --> 35:04.474

35:06.063 --> 35:08.520
The truth about us, Regina.

35:09.316 --> 35:12.228
(CHUCKLING)
What are you talking about?

35:12.361 --> 35:14.067
And how do you know my mother?

35:16.407 --> 35:17.738
The same way you do.

35:20.244 --> 35:22.200
I'm your sister.

35:30.045 --> 35:33.833
Actually, half-sister.
But details, details...

35:33.924 --> 35:36.301
That's not possible.

35:36.385 --> 35:37.465
You're green.

35:37.553 --> 35:39.134
And you're rude.

35:39.221 --> 35:41.086
Cora had me first.

35:41.223 --> 35:44.932
Before she wormed her way
into the dregs of royalty.

35:47.563 --> 35:49.679
You know I'm telling the truth.

35:49.773 --> 35:52.025
How else could I have
broken the door to the crypt?

35:52.776 --> 35:53.765
Our mother

35:54.737 --> 35:57.319
gave me up and sent me away.
But you...

35:57.406 --> 36:00.944
You she kept. You she gave everything.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.328
Everything she wanted.

36:03.412 --> 36:05.528
If what you're saying is true,

36:05.622 --> 36:07.533
then you were lucky to escape her.

36:07.624 --> 36:10.161
Enough with the martyr complex,
Regina.

36:10.252 --> 36:12.163
Try growing up without a mother.

36:12.254 --> 36:14.711
Try living in Oz.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.334
Knowing that no one thought
you were good enough.

36:16.425 --> 36:17.460
Not your mother,

36:17.593 --> 36:21.461
and not the only man
that our paths both crossed.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.134
Rumplestiltskin.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.967
You knew Rumplestiltskin?

36:29.104 --> 36:31.641
Did you think
you were his only student?

36:31.774 --> 36:36.609
Let me guess, you're mad because
he chose me to cast his curse.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.271
Well, get over it.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.318
It wasn't everything
it was cracked up to be.

36:42.451 --> 36:45.158
Anything would have been better
than the life I had.

36:48.957 --> 36:52.120
But, despite my shortcomings,
I made something of myself, dear.

36:52.252 --> 36:54.243
And I didn't need Cora.

36:55.172 --> 36:56.503
Or Rumplestiltskin.

36:56.632 --> 36:58.839
It's too bad they're not around to see
how well you turned out.

36:59.802 --> 37:01.633
They're both dead.

Because I'm going to take
everything away from you.

37:17.152 --> 37:18.483
Too late.

37:19.947 --> 37:21.983
I've already lost everything that matters.

37:22.116 --> 37:25.825
No, Regina,
you haven't lost anything yet.

37:25.953 --> 37:28.035
So you are going to kill me?

37:28.163 --> 37:30.825
No. That's too easy.

37:31.625 --> 37:34.788
For me to get what I want,
I need you to suffer.

37:34.878 --> 37:38.996
You see, what's in store for me
is all my dreams being realized.

37:39.133 --> 37:41.465
But for you? Well...

37:42.886 --> 37:44.968
It's a fate worse than death.

37:46.723 --> 37:48.054
Go ahead.

37:49.852 --> 37:52.184
Bring it, Greenie.

37:54.523 --> 37:56.639
Indeed Iwill.

37:57.693 --> 37:58.682
(WHOOSH)

37:59.695 --> 38:01.526
See you soon, sis.

38:01.905 --> 38:03.111
(CACKLES)

38:17.254 --> 38:18.494
You didn't go through with it?

38:18.589 --> 38:19.829
-(WHOOSH)
-(GRUNTS)

38:20.048 --> 38:21.629
You were right.

38:21.717 --> 38:25.380
The sleeping curse wasn't the answer.

38:25.512 --> 38:26.501
As you said,

38:26.597 --> 38:29.760
I just needed to find
something to live for.

38:29.892 --> 38:32.099
And you found it? What?

38:32.227 --> 38:35.719
The one thing I haven't had
in a very long time.

38:37.107 --> 38:40.395
Someone to destroy.

38:44.907 --> 38:46.647
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

38:46.742 --> 38:50.109
It's going to be fine. Trust me.

38:50.204 --> 38:51.284
(DOOR OPENS)

38:52.748 --> 38:53.954
(VIDEO GAME BEEPING)

38:54.583 --> 38:55.698
(CLEARS THROAT)

38:56.084 --> 38:58.120
Hey, how was your day?

38:58.253 --> 38:59.413
HENRY: Good.

39:00.881 --> 39:02.087
Storybrooke is a weird place.

39:03.091 --> 39:04.080
But cool.

39:04.218 --> 39:06.174
Did you know there's a library
inside a clock tower?

39:06.261 --> 39:08.923
I do. I've been there before.
Come on, I want you to meet someone.

39:12.142 --> 39:13.928
This is Regina Mills.

39:15.145 --> 39:19.229
She's the mayor of this town
and she wanted to meet you.

39:19.316 --> 39:21.147
Is something wrong?

39:21.276 --> 39:22.937
No, no. No, nothing's wrong.

39:24.821 --> 39:28.188
Your motherjust told me
a lot about you.

39:28.283 --> 39:31.741
I hear you like school
and that you're good at English?

39:32.120 --> 39:33.155
Um...

39:33.247 --> 39:36.956
Yeah. Why'd she tell you all this?

39:40.462 --> 39:43.124
Because she couldn't be
prouder of you.

39:45.884 --> 39:46.873
(INHALES SHARPLY)

39:46.969 --> 39:50.507
Uh, while you're in town, I was thinking
maybe I can give you a tour sometime.

39:50.639 --> 39:52.300
You know, show you around.

39:52.432 --> 39:54.969
Maybe we can even stop for ice cream.

39:55.978 --> 39:58.344
Yeah, I'd like that.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.979
So, um...

40:01.608 --> 40:02.848
It was nice meeting you.

40:15.163 --> 40:16.699
How was that? You okay?

40:17.958 --> 40:19.539
It was a start.

40:23.630 --> 40:24.836
We need to talk.

40:28.302 --> 40:29.712
Outside.

40:29.845 --> 40:32.678
They're being turned
into flying monkeys?

40:32.806 --> 40:35.969
Yes. He took on simian form,
with the added bonus of wings.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.924
Do you think that's what happened
to the missing dwarfs, too?

40:38.020 --> 40:40.056
It would explain why we haven't found
any trace of them.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.600
-And Neal?
-No sign of him either.

40:42.691 --> 40:44.682
So, yeah, it's possible.

40:44.818 --> 40:46.524
Wouldn't be the first flying monkey
I've dated.

40:47.821 --> 40:52.281
The person who escaped our trap
disappeared in a cloud of green smoke.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.983
And now there are flying monkeys
in this town.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.864
I think we know exactly who cursed us.

40:56.997 --> 40:58.362
The Wicked Witch of the West?

41:01.168 --> 41:02.749
Seriously? She's real, too?

41:02.878 --> 41:05.085
Says the daughter of Snow White
and Prince Charming.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.293
I don't get it.

41:06.381 --> 41:07.587
It's not like we're in Kansas.

41:07.716 --> 41:09.456
Why would
the Wicked Witch of the West

41:09.551 --> 41:11.712
want to come to Storybrooke?

41:17.934 --> 41:19.140
(DOOR RATTLES)

41:31.073 --> 41:32.563
Hungry?

41:39.122 --> 41:41.955
You never should have
brought me back!

41:44.836 --> 41:46.087
(CHUCKLES)

41:51.426 --> 41:52.802
Eat up.

41:53.762 --> 41:55.627
We've got work to do.

42:08.610 --> 42:11.727
You feed the madness
and it feeds on you

42:12.614 --> 42:15.321
You feed the madness
and it feeds on you

42:16.284 --> 42:19.276
You feed the madness
and it feeds on you

42:20.789 --> 42:22.154
(GIGGLES MANIACALLY)
