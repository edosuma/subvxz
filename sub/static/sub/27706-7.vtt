00:01.281 --> 00:03.050
<i>Previously on</i> The Passage...

00:03.140 --> 00:05.118
<i>Grey infected Elizabeth
with the virus.</i>

00:05.218 --> 00:09.174
You have a passport
for a spectacular future.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.427
She never loved you.
She never will.

00:15.141 --> 00:17.035
- Stop the lights!
- Amy's linked to him.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.225
Elizabeth, too.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.080
I heard a man talking
in the room next door.

00:20.104 --> 00:21.353
<i>I think his name is Anthony.</i>

00:21.439 --> 00:23.230
<i>I'm here for Amy.</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:24.501
It's Amy that's the savior.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.253
Maybe we can prevent
Elizabeth's turn.

00:26.277 --> 00:28.360
- Crowd out Fanning's virus?
- Precisely.

00:28.446 --> 00:30.946
- Damn it.
<i>- I watched our daughter die,</i>

00:31.032 --> 00:33.323
- then I met this little girl.
- Mommy!

00:33.367 --> 00:34.867
- No!
<i>- She doesn't have anybody.</i>

00:34.994 --> 00:36.493
<i>You guys served together.</i>

00:36.579 --> 00:37.745
Special ops, right?

00:37.830 --> 00:39.204
Taught me everything I know.

00:39.331 --> 00:40.642
<i>This whole thing's
gone to hell.</i>

00:40.666 --> 00:42.906
Come up with a plan
to get the three of you out.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:00.561 --> 01:02.644
Go. Go, baby. Go.

01:06.025 --> 01:07.775
Go, go. Come on.

01:09.487 --> 01:10.778
Yeah!

01:10.863 --> 01:12.446
...Yes!

01:12.531 --> 01:14.114
Yes.

01:15.201 --> 01:17.095
- Daddy!
- Baby, that was awesome.

01:17.119 --> 01:19.661
You were incredible.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.871
Oh, my gosh.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.458
Where's Mom?

01:24.543 --> 01:26.521
We have an emergency.
She got pulled into a surgery.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.648
- She's gonna be home late.
- But what about the team dinner?

01:28.672 --> 01:30.734
Mom was supposed to bring
all the trophies.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.798
Oh, my God.
Dad, look at their faces.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.177
They all think
that they're getting trophies.

01:35.221 --> 01:38.222
Hey, what am I? An amateur?
I got a plan.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.598
Come on, let's go.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.600
Come on.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.268
That was awesome.

01:48.734 --> 01:51.318
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:51.403 --> 01:52.611
How's your head?

01:52.696 --> 01:54.029
I'll live.

01:56.659 --> 01:58.992
- We have to get back to Amy.
- Okay.

01:59.078 --> 02:01.829
Is there anything sharp
over there?

02:01.956 --> 02:04.331
Looking.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.834
<i>What the hell's going on
over there?</i>

02:06.919 --> 02:09.127
<i>A security breach
and six fatalities.</i>

02:09.255 --> 02:10.545
<i>Is this gonna keep happening?</i>

02:10.631 --> 02:12.548
Yes. Mr. Secretary,

02:12.633 --> 02:15.384
I was one of the first
to champion this project

02:15.469 --> 02:17.594
and its potential,
but I was wrong.

02:17.721 --> 02:21.140
This entire facility needs
to be buried in concrete.

02:21.267 --> 02:25.102
Or we could take a fresh look
at our challenges and adjust.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.354
The girl has exhibited
signs of telepathy.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.841
She's impervious to disease,
and so far, she's healthy.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.795
She's everything
we've hoped for and more.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.528
<i>What will it take to make
the place sustainable?</i>

02:34.655 --> 02:36.864
First, we're gonna reduce
the feeding schedule

02:36.991 --> 02:38.699
of our patients by 75%.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.837
This will keep them
subdued and compliant.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.871
I have 50 new
security personnel incoming,

02:43.956 --> 02:46.143
and we're gonna increase
their rotations so that nobody's

02:46.167 --> 02:49.001
on 4B long enough
to come under viral influence.

02:49.128 --> 02:50.605
There is no safe level
of exposure.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.607
Everyone is mentally
vulnerable to them.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.214
<i>- Okay, so...</i>
- Well, hold on, now.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.092
Here's a bug that could work
in our favor, Mr. Secretary.

02:57.178 --> 02:59.030
The virals,
they're all connected.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.512
They have a sort of a hive mind,

03:00.556 --> 03:01.783
and they're all linked
to Fanning.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.098
You kill him, they all die.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.808
<i>Including the girl?</i>

03:04.852 --> 03:06.830
Yes. She is linked to him,
just like the rest.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.562
God forgive us.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.565
<i>Deputy Guilder, you're gonna
stay at Project Noah.</i>

03:11.650 --> 03:14.026
<i>Put your new security measures
into place.</i>

03:14.153 --> 03:16.904
<i>I'll leave it up to you
whether Doctors Sykes</i>

03:16.989 --> 03:18.697
<i>and Lear should be reassigned.</i>

03:29.543 --> 03:32.461
The Secretary of Defense has
given Guilder full authority.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.129
Where does that leave us?

03:34.215 --> 03:35.650
Well, I'm pretty sure
I'm getting fired.

03:35.674 --> 03:38.175
I can't speak for you.

03:38.219 --> 03:42.054
Wolgast, Lila, they never made
it back from the hunting party.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.097
- What does that mean?
- Nothing good.

03:44.767 --> 03:47.059
- I'm worried about them.
- Since when?

03:47.186 --> 03:48.518
Since Winston. Since Guilder.

03:48.604 --> 03:50.854
Since this place turned
into the Overlook Hotel.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.190
So what are you gonna do?

03:54.777 --> 03:56.151
I'm gonna find them.

03:56.237 --> 03:58.111
From there, it gets complicated.

03:59.198 --> 04:00.405
The pain was horrible.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.783
It was like something
was digging

04:02.826 --> 04:05.619
throughout my entire body,
just trying to get out.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.958
I tried to kill Fanning.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.627
Oh, Jonas.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.214
All the patients infected with
his blood felt what you felt.

04:18.634 --> 04:21.093
So I guess
he's probably pretty angry.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.929
Safe to assume.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.764
What else is new?

04:25.891 --> 04:27.641
How are you feeling now?

04:27.726 --> 04:31.853
Mm, s-still have chills
and a headache.

04:31.939 --> 04:36.316
You know, like that... that time
at Thanksgiving I had the flu.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.755
Your whole family was there,
and I had to cancel dinner.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.570
...Only this is...

04:40.698 --> 04:42.281
this is definitely worse.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.491
My mother still thinks
you were faking.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.868
Of course.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.246
Look up for me.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.126
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:54.253 --> 04:56.253
Are you okay?

04:58.299 --> 05:00.507
I guess that's not a good thing.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.635
The virus is beginning
to mutate in your body.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.680
So, what now?

05:06.765 --> 05:09.016
We fight it.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.536
We'll use this as a shim, okay?

05:29.621 --> 05:31.224
You're gonna jam it
into that slot right there.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.873
Come on.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.249
Here you go.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.462
Okay.

05:39.465 --> 05:41.131
So, how have you been?

05:41.258 --> 05:42.466
Anything new?

05:43.510 --> 05:44.718
Oh, no, not much.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.740
Just trying to avoid
being executed

05:46.764 --> 05:48.263
by the United States government.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.013
Also, vampires are real,
so that's cool.

05:53.604 --> 05:54.728
Got it. Got it, got it.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.229
Okay, good.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.481
Let me get you.

05:57.566 --> 05:58.857
Okay.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.403
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

06:03.530 --> 06:05.072
Hey. Hi.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.968
- Here's the stuff.
- All right.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.470
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

06:08.494 --> 06:10.869
And I heard you kicked butt
today, kiddo.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.830
Mm. I'm sorry I can't make it.

06:13.916 --> 06:16.625
Babe, what's with the streamers?

06:16.752 --> 06:18.063
You're decorating
the restaurant.

06:18.087 --> 06:19.773
You never said anything
about that.

06:19.797 --> 06:23.090
And, Eva, whatever your
expectations are, lower them.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.278
You don't understand.
Bri's mom did it last year.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.426
It was bad.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.345
People called it hot garbage.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.763
It has to be awesome.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.890
Okay. Well,

06:31.934 --> 06:34.142
we're gonna streamer-shame
Bri's mom to death.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.561
- We got 23 minutes. Let's go.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.666
I'm gonna try to make
the end, okay?

06:38.690 --> 06:40.357
All right. I love you.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.109
What about me?

06:42.194 --> 06:44.569
Oh, I love you.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.950
- Go, Strykers!
- Go, Strykers!

06:59.336 --> 07:01.420
Hello.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.341
I need your help.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.718
I'm looking for Agent Wolgast.

07:08.804 --> 07:10.887
Aren't you the head of security?

07:10.973 --> 07:13.056
I'm asking as his friend.

07:13.142 --> 07:15.142
You shot at him at least twice.

07:15.227 --> 07:17.602
I'm trying to be his friend now.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.651
Have you seen him?

07:24.695 --> 07:26.403
Like you did with Winston?

07:26.530 --> 07:28.029
No.

07:28.157 --> 07:30.657
I tried, but it doesn't
really work that way.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.534
It just happens sometimes.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.619
Hmm.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.413
Is he in trouble?

07:36.498 --> 07:37.914
He's okay.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.793
Agent Wolgast can
take care of himself.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.296
You've seen that guy in action.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.465
He beat you up.

07:46.592 --> 07:48.592
True enough.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.762
I'm gonna find him, okay?

07:54.433 --> 07:56.099
I promise.

07:57.436 --> 08:00.896
Oh. These are for you.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.607
Sit tight. I'll be back.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.990
Did he just give you chips?

08:14.328 --> 08:17.579
Carter. Where have you been?

08:17.664 --> 08:20.123
I'm around.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.417
You changed.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.503
That is true.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.464
And so will you.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.466
When?

08:29.593 --> 08:31.593
Soon.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.347
We need to talk about it.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.768
You know where the agent is?

08:39.895 --> 08:41.436
No.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.999
And if you're gonna
get through this,

08:43.023 --> 08:44.731
you need to rely on yourself.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.816
You're scaring me.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.861
There is some
scary stuff coming.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.115
Hey.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.535
You want me to show you
where your book is?

09:00.666 --> 09:03.750
You know,
I came up under Dick Cheney.

09:03.835 --> 09:06.711
Say what you want about the man,
he did what had to be done.

09:06.755 --> 09:11.132
He believed in promoting based
on merit, not rank or status.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.592
Sir?

09:12.678 --> 09:15.762
Washington has approved
your security proposal.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.049
We're moving forward.
Great work. Thank you.

09:18.100 --> 09:21.101
Oh. Thank you, sir.
I appreciate that.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.062
Between you and me, Martinez,
my ass is on the line here.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.814
This whole staff, top to bottom,

09:25.899 --> 09:27.941
is suffering
from battle fatigue.

09:27.985 --> 09:31.820
I don't blame them.
Three years is way too long.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.008
There are a lot of brilliant
minds out there, sir.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.908
We can bring in a new
medical chief, staff, security.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.618
Richards seems competent to me.

09:38.704 --> 09:41.288
Maybe. But either way,
it feels like the right time

09:41.373 --> 09:43.748
to institute
the new security protocols.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.562
All right, well,
let's talk about access.

09:45.586 --> 09:49.129
Well, I would advise
dialing back across the board.

09:49.214 --> 09:52.299
-Well, I'll remain the last word, but...
-Absolutely.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.903
But whoever else
you give access to the codes

09:53.927 --> 09:55.427
needs to be trustworthy.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.429
I have a couple of suggestions.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.639
All right. Shoot.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.730
Daddy, the guy wants
the deposit.

10:06.857 --> 10:09.043
Okay, sweetheart. I was just
gonna park the car, but here.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.670
Tell him to use
the blue card, okay?

10:10.694 --> 10:12.380
- Isn't there another box?
- No,

10:12.404 --> 10:14.112
we brought everything inside.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.655
But where are the markers?

10:15.741 --> 10:17.719
- What markers?
- For the group photo.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.721
Everybody signs everybody's,
like a yearbook.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.514
I don't know anything
about markers,

10:21.538 --> 10:24.372
but if we're keeping score,
I think that one is on Mommy.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.166
It-it's okay.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.168
Don't say it like that.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.836
- Hold on.
- What?

10:29.963 --> 10:32.297
All right, kiddo. Daddy's gonna
try to save the day.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.133
- I'm gonna find some markers.
- We have 14 minutes.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.177
...Okay.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.240
Is that enough?
Can you get your hand out?

10:39.264 --> 10:40.513
- Here we go.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.308
Oh, God. We must be close.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.455
They're gonna pull us out
one at a time.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.854
One guy's gonna take me first.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.398
It's gonna go fast,
faster than you think.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.192
And then it'll be over.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.321
Brad, what if something
goes wrong?

10:56.406 --> 10:58.615
Something always goes wrong,

10:58.700 --> 11:00.784
but we have to make it
through anyway.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.495
For Amy.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.798
You remember that time
we got food poisoning

11:14.925 --> 11:17.342
from that <i> bacalhau</i> cart in Rio?

11:18.637 --> 11:20.303
Oh, my God, yeah.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.264
This isn't as bad as that.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.101
It's a miracle
either of us survived that.

11:31.233 --> 11:34.109
Maybe we've been dead
this whole time.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.277
I mean, let's be honest,

11:36.363 --> 11:39.322
none of this
seems tethered in reality.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.788
We're doing everything we can.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.959
I have some ideas.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.086
I'll be right back.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.299
Oh. Oh, shoot.

11:58.427 --> 11:59.718
Hey.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.220
Hey. So Amy's blood

12:02.264 --> 12:04.472
didn't make a dent
in Fanning's virus.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.224
Yeah, I think I know why.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.371
Let's bring up the, uh,
routine monitoring protocol.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.853
How's Elizabeth?

12:09.896 --> 12:13.606
She's, uh...
she's brave as hell.

12:13.734 --> 12:17.402
She's cracking jokes
and trying to take care of me.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.738
I've seen what's coming
for her and, uh...

12:19.865 --> 12:22.741
Can we just bring up the data?

12:22.826 --> 12:24.451
Oh, yeah. Of course.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.582
Guilder's revoked
my security clearance.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.250
Let me try.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.217
Okay, so here
are the viral titers.

12:41.303 --> 12:42.947
Yeah, okay, see here,
this surge?

12:42.971 --> 12:44.907
I think that's
dormant reservoirs activating

12:44.931 --> 12:46.659
to replace the virus
you just destroyed.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.703
Yeah, dormant reservoirs,
like in HIV?

12:48.727 --> 12:50.329
Yeah, which means
we need to knock out

12:50.353 --> 12:51.789
all of Fanning's virus
in one punch.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.207
Well, if we can't
overwhelm them,

12:53.231 --> 12:54.917
they'll just be kicking
her viral transformation

12:54.941 --> 12:57.233
- into high gear.
- Yeah, I'm desperate.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.195
I did this to her.
I need to fix it.

13:00.322 --> 13:03.031
I'm not gonna let her
turn into one of them.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.204
Fanning, I'm getting
a little worried about you.

13:09.331 --> 13:13.208
And by "you," I mean all of us
because we're waiting on you.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.752
It's almost over.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.607
Really?
'Cause it kind of seems

13:17.631 --> 13:20.548
like we're losing
the upper hand here.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.967
I'm not leaving
without Elizabeth.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.220
What if she doesn't choose you?

13:26.389 --> 13:28.681
Is this how it's gonna be?

13:28.767 --> 13:31.893
I mean, I thought you said
we'd feel free.

13:31.937 --> 13:35.647
Then why do I feel so alone?
Why do I care about Richards?

13:35.732 --> 13:39.150
Tell me this is just
a humanity hangover.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.945
I wish I could, kiddo.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.031
Are we ever getting out of here?

13:45.158 --> 13:46.198
Elizabeth makes 12.

13:46.284 --> 13:49.160
Not if she says no.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.663
She'll say yes.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.998
Then we'll be 12.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.125
But what if she doesn't?

14:01.132 --> 14:03.258
You know, you can't actually
take that back with you,

14:03.343 --> 14:05.218
'cause we're not really here.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.422
But it's there when you
want to come get it.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.768
You're thinking about your mom.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.564
She gave me that book.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.107
When you think about her,

14:19.192 --> 14:21.234
tell me what you remember.

14:22.654 --> 14:24.362
I don't want to talk about that.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.156
I know you don't,
but it's important.

14:27.242 --> 14:30.493
Come on, what is it?

14:30.579 --> 14:32.662
I can see a piece of it.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.082
I can see you

14:36.167 --> 14:38.793
and the book.

14:40.463 --> 14:43.882
You're in front of a school.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.070
- You're crying.
- Just because you're in my head

14:46.094 --> 14:48.595
doesn't mean it makes it
your business.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.533
It's totally my business.
We're linked.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.808
All of us who got the injection.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.269
I'm not joining
your stupid club.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.021
Focus on the memory, Amy.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.273
I see you running.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.026
You're still crying.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.361
You're lost,

15:05.447 --> 15:07.780
trying to find home,
but it-it's hard.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.949
It hasn't been home
for long, has it?

15:09.993 --> 15:11.951
Wait, where are you running?

15:12.037 --> 15:13.828
Where is home, Amy?

15:13.914 --> 15:16.497
You're being a jerk.
Now, take me back to my room.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.663
Now, you can leave
any time you want to.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.288
What happened to your mom?

15:22.213 --> 15:24.505
What did you do? Say it.

15:24.633 --> 15:27.216
- You're being mean.
- You th-think I'm mean?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.510
The guy that's coming for you
is pure evil, Amy.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.012
This is just a dry run.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.389
Now tell me what happened.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.850
You feel bad about something.
Say it.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.101
What is it?

15:37.228 --> 15:39.479
It was my fault, okay?

15:41.024 --> 15:43.232
I'm the reason she's dead.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.488
She made us move again,

15:48.573 --> 15:52.075
and I hated everything
about the new place.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.827
I wanted to go to school.

15:54.913 --> 15:58.122
They didn't let me in because
she forgot to register me.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.999
So I went home,

16:00.126 --> 16:02.835
and we had a bad fight.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.008
I told her I hated her,

16:09.094 --> 16:11.052
and she cried.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.264
She thought I meant it.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.395
I didn't want to see her cry.

16:22.857 --> 16:25.400
So I took my book, and I left.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.527
And when I came back...

16:31.700 --> 16:33.908
...the ambulance was there.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.456
It was too late.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.550
Amy, mind if I come in?

16:51.886 --> 16:54.137
Hello, Amy.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.931
I wanted to drop by,

16:56.975 --> 16:59.475
pay you a visit,
see how you're feeling.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.813
Where's the agent?

17:03.898 --> 17:06.898
Mm, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.444
Agent Wolgast has gone home.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.904
He wanted me
to tell you goodbye.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.781
I don't believe you.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.118
I'm sorry.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.664
Adults can be unreliable,
as I'm sure we both know.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.878
You have no idea what goes on
around here, do you?

17:27.964 --> 17:31.591
You think you're in charge,
but you're not.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.218
Why do you say that?

17:34.304 --> 17:36.054
Are you seeing something?

17:39.517 --> 17:43.186
Screw you
and your weird mustache.

17:46.608 --> 17:49.650
- $9.78, please.
- Nine-seven...

17:49.694 --> 17:52.320
Wow. Oh, man.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.614
- You got the $9.78 or what?
- Yeah, I do.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.635
I just, uh, left my wallet
across the street,

17:56.659 --> 17:59.243
but, uh...

17:59.329 --> 18:01.329
Look at that.
Help is on the way.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.998
That's wonderful news.

18:08.630 --> 18:11.172
This is it.
Put your cuffs back on.

18:11.299 --> 18:14.967
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Okay.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.688
Hey.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.702
Put all the money in a bag.

19:22.829 --> 19:23.744
- Hey.
- Now!

19:23.830 --> 19:25.913
Do what he says. It's okay.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.476
- Hurry up, dumbass!
- Hey, hey, hey.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.019
You'll be out of here
with your money

19:29.043 --> 19:31.169
in a few seconds.
Take it easy.

19:34.549 --> 19:37.091
- You look like a cop.
- I'm not. I promise.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.051
I'm just trying to help, man

19:40.930 --> 19:43.181
- Dad, there...
- No!

20:02.327 --> 20:04.660
Someday maybe you'll tell me
how we got here.

20:08.166 --> 20:11.125
The car has GPS, so if we
take it, they'll track us.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.669
The pumping station's
not too far away.

20:13.796 --> 20:15.546
We can hitch a ride back to Noah

20:15.590 --> 20:17.026
on one of the
cleaning crew's Humvees.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.258
Except they know
your face, Brad.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.093
Okay, clarification:

20:21.179 --> 20:23.199
We're stealing one
of the cleaning crew's Humvees.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.326
-Great. -What do you
want me to say, Lila?

20:25.350 --> 20:27.350
That I'm sorry
for keeping you safe?

20:27.936 --> 20:30.478
Which way
to the pumping station?

20:32.232 --> 20:33.856
<i>Sometimes, I feel like...</i>

20:35.652 --> 20:37.693
...I can't breathe.

20:37.820 --> 20:41.155
Like, if I let myself,
I'll just fade away.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.783
Going back to work
is the answer?

20:43.826 --> 20:45.368
It's something to try.

20:45.495 --> 20:49.664
It's got to be better than
walking around that empty house.

20:49.791 --> 20:53.292
I miss her so much.

20:53.378 --> 20:56.545
And, Brad, do you think getting
back to work is a good idea?

20:56.631 --> 20:59.215
I think it's a delusion.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.300
Say more about that.

21:04.472 --> 21:09.100
I think that no amount
of therapy or going back to work

21:09.227 --> 21:11.205
is going to change
what happened to Eva.

21:11.229 --> 21:12.603
Of course it's not gonna change

21:12.730 --> 21:15.273
what happened.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.733
I just want to let
something else happen.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.485
You barely even talk to me.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.257
I don't understand
how you can even think

21:21.281 --> 21:22.530
about going back to work.

21:24.033 --> 21:27.660
I want to be useful.

21:27.745 --> 21:30.413
I want to be needed.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.081
I want to help.

21:32.166 --> 21:35.710
That's what makes me
feel better.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.503
I want to help you.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.672
I want us to help
each other, but...

21:39.799 --> 21:41.277
that doesn't seem
to be happening.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.467
How's it make you feel
when she says that?

21:46.264 --> 21:49.098
Why don't you want
to respond to that?

21:51.185 --> 21:52.852
Look, I have a really busy day.

21:52.937 --> 21:55.646
If you don't mind, I'd like
to cut it a little early.

21:55.732 --> 21:58.357
I'm staying.

21:58.443 --> 22:01.319
If you don't want the time,
I'll use it.

22:20.798 --> 22:23.090
You've been missed
at the Bureau.

22:23.217 --> 22:25.051
And also at my goodbye party.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.762
Yeah, I'm sorry I missed it.

22:32.310 --> 22:34.810
I shouldn't be giving you this.

22:39.650 --> 22:42.101
You really couldn't
identify him in the lineup?

22:42.195 --> 22:44.904
Yeah, no, it's-it's weird.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.322
Don't do it.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.406
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:54.957 --> 22:57.792
Do you want to get
something to eat?

22:57.919 --> 23:00.127
Just hang out?

23:00.213 --> 23:01.962
Might be good for you.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.382
No, I'm good. I ate already.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.719
What's his address?

23:08.805 --> 23:10.096
I have no idea.

23:10.223 --> 23:12.390
You already memorized it.

23:14.185 --> 23:16.894
Come on, Brad. What is it?

23:18.106 --> 23:20.856
7533 West Race Avenue.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.483
Apartment 2A.

23:26.864 --> 23:28.697
She was my daughter, Clark.

23:30.660 --> 23:33.035
She was my goddaughter.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.041
They will nail this guy
to the wall.

23:40.294 --> 23:42.586
He will rot in a cell.

23:42.672 --> 23:44.880
But if you kill him...

23:44.966 --> 23:47.091
you're gonna be locked up.

23:48.803 --> 23:50.928
And I'll be
one best friend short.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.060
Go home.

23:59.272 --> 24:00.938
Hold your wife.

24:02.817 --> 24:04.692
Start over.

24:04.819 --> 24:06.652
It is possible.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.259
Loman, do you copy?

24:33.264 --> 24:34.930
Loman, do you read?

24:39.562 --> 24:42.271
...Brad, do you read me?

24:42.398 --> 24:43.731
Brother.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.941
<i>Are you okay?</i>

24:46.027 --> 24:47.985
<i>Is Lila okay?</i>

24:48.070 --> 24:49.778
<i>Do you need help?</i>

24:49.822 --> 24:52.239
I'm worried you might have
picked up a tail.

25:01.584 --> 25:04.251
- Should we be worried about him?
- No, we should not.

25:09.050 --> 25:10.424
Are you okay?

25:10.510 --> 25:12.092
As long as we get back to Amy.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.427
- You okay?

25:13.513 --> 25:15.262
Not in the slightest.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.568
Um...

25:29.695 --> 25:31.695
I'm sorry about before.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.491
You were a bully.

25:37.370 --> 25:40.037
I want to talk about
that story you told me.

25:40.164 --> 25:41.789
Do you like seeing me cry?

25:41.874 --> 25:43.874
- This is why you're doing this?
- No.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.711
I want you to beat Fanning.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.566
I don't even know
who Fanning is.

25:49.590 --> 25:50.798
He knows you.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.819
And he wants to take
all that guilt

25:52.843 --> 25:54.510
and pain that you feel...

25:54.595 --> 25:56.929
and use it against you.

25:58.391 --> 26:00.849
You had a fight with your mom.
That's all.

26:00.935 --> 26:02.977
I made her sad.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.398
It's not your fault.

26:09.068 --> 26:12.444
She had an addiction.
That's all.

26:12.530 --> 26:14.697
She wouldn't want you
to be sorry.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.075
I bet...

26:18.160 --> 26:21.078
I bet she's sorry.

26:21.163 --> 26:22.599
She wouldn't blame you
for what happened.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.123
No one does.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.333
Because it wasn't your fault.

26:26.460 --> 26:27.960
Okay?

26:29.046 --> 26:31.297
How can I trust you?

26:34.385 --> 26:37.094
What Fanning wants
is for you to believe

26:37.221 --> 26:38.929
the worst about yourself.

26:39.056 --> 26:42.558
He'll make you feel alone...
and scared.

26:42.685 --> 26:46.729
He'll make it seem like
he's the only one who wants you.

26:46.856 --> 26:48.147
It's not true.

26:48.232 --> 26:49.690
Don't buy it.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.611
You have people.
You have the agent.

26:54.697 --> 26:56.071
You have me.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.658
And you have yourself.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.537
Is that what he did to you?

27:05.541 --> 27:06.832
Yes.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.961
Are you bad now?

27:13.674 --> 27:16.383
I'm trying to be
better than him.

27:22.767 --> 27:26.101
But hunger makes you
do weird things.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.146
Don't go.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.398
I have to.

27:31.525 --> 27:32.858
He doesn't know I'm here.

27:32.943 --> 27:34.985
I don't want to be alone.

27:35.071 --> 27:36.195
You don't have to be.

27:36.280 --> 27:39.698
You are more powerful
than you realize.

27:39.825 --> 27:42.660
You can go anywhere you want.

27:50.753 --> 27:53.045
Jonas, the way
these numbers look,

27:53.130 --> 27:56.423
the antiviral can't keep up
with the increased viral titer.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.403
Then let's just
push more antiviral.

27:58.427 --> 28:01.428
We can, but it will buy you
minutes, not a cure.

28:01.514 --> 28:03.575
Fine, then just push
every antiviral in the lab.

28:03.599 --> 28:05.535
I want to buy
every minute available.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.434
Okay.

28:13.234 --> 28:15.484
Jonas, sit with me.

28:15.569 --> 28:17.778
Hold my hand.

28:25.413 --> 28:27.204
How are you feeling?

28:29.083 --> 28:31.625
Elizabeth, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

28:31.711 --> 28:34.253
You shouldn't have done
any of this to me.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.673
Elizabeth, you're so close,

28:37.800 --> 28:40.467
and I know you're scared,

28:40.594 --> 28:43.637
but all you have to do
is choose,

28:43.681 --> 28:45.641
and you won't regret it,
I promise.

28:45.725 --> 28:48.517
You can forget
about this whole life.

28:48.602 --> 28:51.562
I don't want to forget my life.

28:51.689 --> 28:53.564
I loved it.

28:53.691 --> 28:55.482
You'll have a different life.

28:55.568 --> 28:59.403
I don't want it.

28:59.488 --> 29:02.156
That's just fear talking.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.324
You're scared of dying, right?

29:04.452 --> 29:07.786
Oh, and you should be,

29:07.830 --> 29:10.497
'cause there is nothing in death

29:10.624 --> 29:13.375
but being cold and being alone.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.336
But you don't have to go there.

29:16.464 --> 29:18.547
I love you.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.634
It's okay.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.845
You can say yes.

30:10.017 --> 30:12.351
I have to get to Amy.

30:12.436 --> 30:14.645
You know Amy's not Eva.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.230
Of course I know that.

30:16.357 --> 30:19.691
I just mean that one has nothing
to do with the other.

30:19.819 --> 30:21.193
Yes, it does.

30:21.278 --> 30:22.820
I have a chance.

30:22.905 --> 30:24.822
A chance to do what?

30:24.907 --> 30:26.698
To make up for what happened.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.867
You can't make up
for what happened.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.577
Lila, I was there.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.766
I should've been able
to stop the guy, but I didn't.

30:32.790 --> 30:33.747
It was my fault.

30:33.791 --> 30:36.166
Well, I wasn't there.

30:36.293 --> 30:37.668
Maybe it was my fault.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.356
Did you ever think about that?
Because I have.

30:39.380 --> 30:40.420
Lila, no.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.215
No, I didn't have
to take that surgery.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.195
I could have trusted
an attending to do it,

30:45.219 --> 30:46.802
but I didn't.

30:46.846 --> 30:49.157
If I hadn't worked late,
if I had gone to the dinner,

30:49.181 --> 30:51.890
the whole thing would've
played out differently.

30:51.976 --> 30:54.726
Everybody lives, and Eva's
in the eighth grade right now.

30:54.812 --> 30:55.812
Stop.

30:55.896 --> 30:58.814
Oh, no, wait, how about this?

30:58.858 --> 31:02.651
What if I hadn't forgotten
the stupid markers?

31:02.695 --> 31:04.840
Then you wouldn't go
to the convenience store,

31:04.864 --> 31:07.531
Eva would've never
brought you your wallet.

31:07.658 --> 31:12.578
Everybody lives and we're
at home right now making dinner.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.166
You know what?

31:17.293 --> 31:19.626
I bought the markers at lunch.

31:19.712 --> 31:22.254
I just forgot to put them
in the box.

31:22.339 --> 31:24.276
Lila, it's not your fault,
it's not. Please.

31:24.300 --> 31:28.760
If you don't blame me,
how can you blame you?

31:28.888 --> 31:31.889
It was a horrible thing,

31:31.974 --> 31:34.725
but I still need you,

31:34.852 --> 31:39.479
and I can't have you
until you forgive yourself.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.231
Can you please just do that?

31:41.358 --> 31:43.400
Can we both do that?

31:50.200 --> 31:52.534
You don't understand what I did.

31:54.622 --> 31:56.788
Then tell me.

31:59.543 --> 32:00.959
Weapons on the ground.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.921
Hands in the air.

32:17.186 --> 32:19.269
All right,
we don't have a lot of time.

32:19.313 --> 32:21.553
You need to get out of here.
We'll clean this up.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.358
Hey. You with me?

32:24.485 --> 32:26.485
I-I'm gonna turn myself in.

32:26.570 --> 32:29.529
No, you're not.
No, no, no, no, no.

32:29.615 --> 32:32.366
It's not your best day, Brad.
It's not your last, either.

32:32.493 --> 32:35.160
I got lost, man.
I'm still lost.

32:35.245 --> 32:36.828
I don't...

32:36.956 --> 32:38.288
- You need a plan.

32:38.374 --> 32:40.958
You need focus, brother.

32:41.085 --> 32:43.418
Something important,
something that's gonna,

32:43.462 --> 32:45.440
gonna help you get
your bearings back.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.881
There's nowhere to go.

32:49.593 --> 32:53.428
You know that job I'm starting?
Project Noah?

32:53.555 --> 32:56.223
- It's not just a job.

32:56.266 --> 32:58.370
It's a mission that's
gonna change the world.

32:58.394 --> 33:00.435
This could be good for you.

33:16.829 --> 33:17.973
Let me get you out of here.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.746
Come on.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.008
Turn around.

33:35.139 --> 33:36.388
On your knees.

33:59.496 --> 34:02.289
Everybody okay?

34:02.374 --> 34:04.916
I don't know, you tell me.

34:11.257 --> 34:14.092
I didn't know what
Guilder was doing.

34:14.178 --> 34:16.428
Is Amy okay?

34:16.513 --> 34:19.097
She's fine.

34:19.183 --> 34:21.077
I promised her
I'd bring you back.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.851
Why should I believe you?

34:25.230 --> 34:27.397
Because Project Noah's
a horror show.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.568
I just wish I'd seen it sooner.

34:31.695 --> 34:33.652
You know the training.

34:33.697 --> 34:36.364
It's mission before everything.

34:36.449 --> 34:38.909
What now?

34:38.994 --> 34:43.163
We go back... and get Amy,
and get you guys out of here.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.716
You wanted to know
how we got here.

34:54.802 --> 34:57.260
After Eva died...

34:58.972 --> 35:02.724
...they called me in to identify
the guy who killed her.

35:04.728 --> 35:08.021
I pretended I didn't
recognize him.

35:08.107 --> 35:12.359
And then I tracked him down
and I killed him.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.492
Did it make you feel better?

35:20.577 --> 35:22.285
No.

35:24.498 --> 35:26.665
It turned me into a monster.

35:26.750 --> 35:30.085
It was like a fuse
was lit that day.

35:32.131 --> 35:34.506
I took the job at Project Noah.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.175
And then I got
a dozen death row inmates

35:37.261 --> 35:39.970
across the country
to sign a piece of paper

35:40.013 --> 35:43.098
so the government could
turn them into monsters, too.

35:46.061 --> 35:48.248
I didn't know exactly
what was happening to them,

35:48.272 --> 35:51.940
but I knew if I asked,
I wouldn't like it.

35:52.943 --> 35:55.861
So that's how we got here.

35:59.116 --> 36:02.409
You have to stick by Amy...

36:02.494 --> 36:04.578
whatever happens.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.997
No matter what.

36:11.962 --> 36:15.130
Martinez, get in here.
Let's go over this.

36:15.257 --> 36:16.840
Yes, sir.

36:18.010 --> 36:20.051
What am I missing?

36:20.095 --> 36:21.928
Cameras here and here.

36:22.014 --> 36:24.514
Additional retina scanners
to access the elevators.

36:24.558 --> 36:27.017
- Check. Password randomizer?
- It's implemented.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.518
Changes twice daily.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.206
- Two-man rule.
- Fast-tracked.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.583
But if that's not up and running
by tomorrow,

36:31.607 --> 36:33.334
let me know
and I'll crack the whip.

36:33.358 --> 36:36.067
The cages now require two keys
used simultaneously

36:36.195 --> 36:37.694
on separate panels.

36:39.198 --> 36:40.739
What about Amy?

36:40.782 --> 36:43.325
I have high hopes for her.

36:43.452 --> 36:45.243
She's proof of the concept.

36:45.287 --> 36:48.622
Fingers crossed, she can turn
this colossal failure,

36:48.707 --> 36:52.334
waste of money...
into a miracle.

36:55.172 --> 36:58.006
Her fever's 104.8
and still rising.

36:58.050 --> 37:01.051
Yeah, and her heart rate
is dangerously high.

37:01.094 --> 37:02.010
I'm not giving up.

37:02.095 --> 37:04.638
She's still fighting.

37:04.765 --> 37:06.932
The treatment is prolonging
her suffering.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.351
Her organs are gonna shut down,

37:09.394 --> 37:11.061
and then she'll come to the same

37:11.188 --> 37:13.772
fork in the road as the others.

37:13.815 --> 37:16.399
Die or become one of them.

37:19.363 --> 37:21.238
I'm sorry, Jonas.

37:23.742 --> 37:26.076
God knows what
he's saying to her.

37:29.122 --> 37:31.915
We're almost there, Elizabeth.

38:24.094 --> 38:25.427
Mama?

38:25.554 --> 38:28.013
Hey, baby.
How was your day?

38:30.517 --> 38:33.893
- Oh, come on, now, what's this?

38:35.689 --> 38:38.064
Come here.

38:39.693 --> 38:41.254
Ain't nothing so bad
we can't fix it.

38:41.278 --> 38:45.405
- Come on, come on.

38:55.292 --> 38:57.500
Turn off the machines.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.401
Jonas, please.

39:23.528 --> 39:24.986
No.

39:25.072 --> 39:26.237
Enough.

39:28.575 --> 39:30.367
...It's okay.

39:30.494 --> 39:32.077
It's not okay, Elizabeth.

39:32.162 --> 39:34.412
It's never gonna be okay.

39:34.498 --> 39:36.998
I choose you.

39:38.502 --> 39:42.128
I choose my life with you.

40:16.206 --> 40:18.790
I love you...

40:18.917 --> 40:22.377
every day for the rest
of your life.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.260
I love you.

40:32.222 --> 40:33.972
- I love you.
-

40:36.393 --> 40:37.976
I love you.

40:42.899 --> 40:45.150
I love you.

41:01.793 --> 41:02.917
Amy.

41:03.003 --> 41:05.795
Amy, hi, honey.

41:05.881 --> 41:08.298
Honey, wake up.

41:08.425 --> 41:10.425
Amy?

41:15.724 --> 41:18.141
I'm sorry about what I said.

41:18.226 --> 41:20.143
Shh...

41:20.187 --> 41:23.980
I know you didn't mean it,
and it's okay to be upset.

41:26.067 --> 41:28.902
I'm sorry I forgot
to register you at school.

41:31.031 --> 41:33.323
So you're not mad?

41:33.408 --> 41:36.284
Of course not.

41:36.369 --> 41:38.786
You can just forget
all about that now.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.083
I miss you.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.377
And I miss you.

41:48.381 --> 41:50.215
I love you.

41:53.762 --> 41:56.137
I'm sorry I'm not there.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.933
Everyone says I'm special.

42:03.647 --> 42:06.564
But I'm afraid I'm a monster.

42:06.650 --> 42:09.651
I know what kind
of kid I raised.

42:11.363 --> 42:13.696
I know who you are.

42:17.536 --> 42:20.537
You're like the sun.

42:30.465 --> 42:32.465
What is this for?

42:34.094 --> 42:36.344
Light your way.

42:38.682 --> 42:40.682
It's him.

42:45.522 --> 42:46.604
Don't get it.

42:46.731 --> 42:49.065
I have to, Mama.

43:13.300 --> 43:15.049
Hello, Amy.
