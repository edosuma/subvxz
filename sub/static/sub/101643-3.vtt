00:03.542 --> 00:05.294
ARMORER:
Have you ever removed your helmet?

00:05.377 --> 00:06.378
THE MANDALORIAN: No.

00:06.462 --> 00:08.172
ARMORER:
Has it ever been removed by others?

00:08.255 --> 00:09.632
THE MANDALORIAN: Never.

00:09.715 --> 00:10.883
ARMORER: This is the Way.

00:10.966 --> 00:12.426
MANDALORIAN GROUP: This is the Way.

00:13.636 --> 00:15.638
A Mandalorian covert is close.

00:15.721 --> 00:17.223
The contact will lead you to them.

00:17.806 --> 00:20.351
However, no hyperdrive.

00:20.434 --> 00:22.811
Moving fast is the only thing
keeping me safe.

00:22.895 --> 00:25.439
CARSON: Razor Crest, stand down.
We will fire.

00:28.025 --> 00:30.361
-THE MANDALORIAN: Hold on.
-

00:32.363 --> 00:36.075
THE MANDALORIAN: We're lucky if we
get off this frozen tomb with our lives.

00:37.034 --> 00:38.702
Go, go, go! Back to the ship!

00:52.091 --> 00:53.259
Am I under arrest?

00:53.843 --> 00:55.177
CARSON: Technically, you should be.

00:55.761 --> 00:57.346
But these are trying times.

00:57.429 --> 01:00.474
I'm gonna repair the cockpit enough
for us to limp to Trask.

01:00.891 --> 01:03.352
There's nothing I can do
about the main hull's integrity,

01:03.435 --> 01:05.563
so we're gonna have to get cozy
in the cockpit.

01:06.063 --> 01:07.606
It's gonna be a long ride.

02:22.348 --> 02:24.308
THE MANDALORIAN: Looks like we made it.

02:24.767 --> 02:26.143
Get ready for landing.

02:27.728 --> 02:29.021
Dank farrik!

02:29.522 --> 02:31.023
The landing array isn't responding.

02:31.607 --> 02:34.401
Without the guidance system,
it'll be a manual re-entry.

02:34.485 --> 02:35.653
It might get choppy.

02:37.655 --> 02:41.075
Once we're through the atmosphere,
there should be enough fuel to slow down.

02:42.159 --> 02:43.869
If we don't burn to a crisp.

02:59.468 --> 03:02.388
Come up here. I need your hands!

03:06.475 --> 03:09.603
This lever needs to stay back.
Can you do that?

03:11.522 --> 03:13.107
Keep it steady. Here we go.

03:27.204 --> 03:29.373
FLIGHT CONTROL:
Razor Crest, this is Trask flight control.

03:29.456 --> 03:31.584
Please reduce your speed to port protocol.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.169
I'm trying my best here.

03:33.252 --> 03:35.504
Engage reverse thrusters. Brace!

03:42.136 --> 03:43.387
Hold on.

03:45.389 --> 03:48.142
FLIGHT CONTROL: Razor Crest, do you copy?
You have to reduce speed.

03:48.225 --> 03:50.227
Almost there, almost there.

03:50.311 --> 03:52.021
FLIGHT CONTROL: Razor Crest, do you copy?

03:54.481 --> 03:56.775
Razor Crest, you're coming in too fast.
You have to re...

04:04.033 --> 04:06.660
Here we go. Nice and easy.

04:58.546 --> 05:00.339
DOCK WORKER:
So, how can I help you?

05:00.965 --> 05:02.216
THE MANDALORIAN:
Can you fix it?

05:03.884 --> 05:05.386
Fix it? Nah.

05:05.469 --> 05:06.887
But I can make it fly.

05:08.138 --> 05:09.139
Do what you can.

05:12.268 --> 05:13.477
I'll fuel it up.

05:14.770 --> 05:16.272
If it still holds fuel.

06:13.412 --> 06:14.496
I know you're hungry.

06:14.997 --> 06:17.124
-We'll get you something to eat.
-

06:20.252 --> 06:22.421
-You're welcome.

06:24.131 --> 06:26.634
I was told you could lead me
to others of my kind.

06:31.722 --> 06:33.140
The inn? Over there?

07:18.394 --> 07:19.562
THE MANDALORIAN: Thank you.

07:20.646 --> 07:21.939
Have a seat over there.

07:26.819 --> 07:27.987
What can I get you?

07:28.070 --> 07:29.071
Nothing for me.

07:29.154 --> 07:31.657
A bowl of chowder for my friend.

07:31.740 --> 07:33.242
These seats are scarce, buddy.

07:33.742 --> 07:35.494
Everyone seated needs to eat.

07:35.578 --> 07:37.121
I can buy something else.

07:38.789 --> 07:39.790
Information.

07:44.003 --> 07:46.297
Have you seen others that look like me?

07:53.762 --> 07:56.307
Others with beskar have been through here.

07:59.351 --> 08:01.187
THE MANDALORIAN: Who can take me to them?

08:01.270 --> 08:03.147
SERVER:
I know someone who might help.

08:12.239 --> 08:13.324
There's a Mandalorian.

08:15.201 --> 08:16.619
Looking for others of his kind.

08:17.119 --> 08:18.746
He was askin' about passage...

08:19.246 --> 08:20.456
He's wearing beskar.

08:28.631 --> 08:29.882
Don't play with your food.

08:38.432 --> 08:39.433
Hmm.

08:40.601 --> 08:42.520
You seek others of your kind?

08:43.270 --> 08:45.439
-Have you seen them?
-Aye.

08:46.315 --> 08:49.026
I can bring you to them.

08:49.443 --> 08:52.446
-Where?
-Only a few hours' sail.

08:53.489 --> 08:54.823
It'll cost you, though.

09:18.430 --> 09:20.140
QUARREN'S BROTHER 1: Coming around.

09:20.224 --> 09:22.101
QUARREN'S BROTHER 2: Try the other side.

09:22.351 --> 09:24.353
QUARREN'S BROTHER 3:
Oh, give me! Yeah, thank you.

09:25.354 --> 09:26.730
QUARREN'S BROTHER 2:
Over the side!

09:26.814 --> 09:28.732
You ever see a mamacore eat?

09:29.358 --> 09:30.484
Quite a sight.

09:33.279 --> 09:34.989
Child might take an interest.

09:39.159 --> 09:40.327
You should take a look.

09:41.912 --> 09:43.247
Come on over here.

09:44.123 --> 09:46.667
Get a good view. Let the kid see.

09:48.419 --> 09:50.045
-All right, close enough.
-

09:50.129 --> 09:51.839
QUARREN: There we go.

10:05.186 --> 10:06.437
She must be hungry.

10:06.854 --> 10:09.899
Oftentimes we'll feed her
in the early morning,

10:09.982 --> 10:12.526
but we missed that
'cause we were goin' out of port!

10:12.610 --> 10:13.694
No!

10:18.866 --> 10:21.744
Lock it up! Go, go! Now! Go!

10:23.913 --> 10:25.164
The beskar is ours!

10:27.666 --> 10:29.877
-Drown him!
-

10:29.960 --> 10:32.880
-Get him! Get him! There we go!
-Drown him.

10:36.050 --> 10:38.093
-We're rich, brothers!
-

10:39.553 --> 10:42.014
-He didn't sink! Finish him!

10:42.139 --> 10:43.641
Keep him down!

10:50.105 --> 10:51.774
-

11:20.052 --> 11:21.178
Take my hand.

11:23.013 --> 11:24.515
There's a creature.

11:25.015 --> 11:27.184
-It has the Child.
-On it!

11:30.396 --> 11:32.439
THE MANDALORIAN:
The Child. Help the Child.

11:32.523 --> 11:34.441
BO-KATAN:
Don't worry, brother. We've got this.

11:43.367 --> 11:45.160
-

12:00.092 --> 12:01.969
KOSKA REEVES:
Here you go, little one.

12:09.935 --> 12:10.978
Thank you.

12:13.230 --> 12:15.316
I've been searching for more of our kind.

12:15.941 --> 12:17.860
BO-KATAN:
Well, lucky we found you first.

12:18.527 --> 12:20.654
I've been quested to deliver this Child.

12:20.738 --> 12:21.780
I was hoping that...

12:32.875 --> 12:34.460
Where did you get that armor?

12:35.336 --> 12:38.005
This armor has been in my family
for three generations.

12:38.088 --> 12:39.465
You do not cover your face.

12:40.257 --> 12:41.592
You are not Mandalorian.

12:43.052 --> 12:45.513
-He's one of them.
-Dank farrik.

12:45.596 --> 12:46.639
One of what?

12:48.432 --> 12:51.227
I am Bo-Katan of Clan Kryze.

12:52.186 --> 12:54.480
I was born on Mandalore
and fought in the Purge.

12:55.147 --> 12:56.690
I am the last of my line.

12:59.068 --> 13:01.487
And you are a Child of the Watch.

13:02.947 --> 13:04.031
The Watch?

13:04.823 --> 13:07.159
Children of the Watch
are a cult of religious zealots

13:07.243 --> 13:09.328
that broke away from Mandalorian society.

13:09.787 --> 13:12.581
Their goal was to re-establish
the ancient way.

13:15.042 --> 13:16.544
THE MANDALORIAN:
There is only one way.

13:17.586 --> 13:18.838
The Way of the Mandalore.

14:09.638 --> 14:10.806
QUARREN: Hey!

14:12.391 --> 14:13.392
You...

14:17.438 --> 14:19.607
You killed my brother.

14:28.866 --> 14:29.992
Let me pass.

14:32.953 --> 14:35.789
I don't you think you understand.

14:38.918 --> 14:40.628
You killed my brother

14:41.462 --> 14:44.965
and now I'm gonna kill your pet.

14:51.347 --> 14:53.390
BO-KATAN:
He didn't kill your brother.

14:55.559 --> 14:56.560
I did.

15:05.361 --> 15:07.029
Can we at least buy you a drink?

15:08.614 --> 15:10.699
Trask is a black market port.

15:11.408 --> 15:13.827
They're staging weapons
that have been bought and sold

15:13.911 --> 15:15.996
with the plunders of our planet.

15:16.539 --> 15:19.959
We're seizing those weapons
and using them to retake our home world.

15:21.001 --> 15:22.419
Once we've done that,

15:22.920 --> 15:24.922
we'll seat a new Mandalore on the throne.

15:25.005 --> 15:26.757
That planet is cursed.

15:26.841 --> 15:28.217
Anyone who goes there dies.

15:29.093 --> 15:31.136
Once the Empire knew
they couldn't control it,

15:31.220 --> 15:33.138
they made sure no one else could either.

15:33.639 --> 15:35.516
BO-KATAN:
Don't believe everything you hear.

15:35.599 --> 15:37.726
Our enemies wanna separate us.

15:38.519 --> 15:41.063
But Mandalorians are stronger together.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.274
That's not part of my plan.

15:43.899 --> 15:46.443
I've been quested
with returning this Child to the Jedi.

15:48.779 --> 15:50.906
-What do you know of the Jedi?
-THE MANDALORIAN: Nothing.

15:52.157 --> 15:53.993
I was hoping you would help me by Creed.

16:06.881 --> 16:08.799
I can lead you to one of their kind.

16:12.011 --> 16:14.054
But first,
we need your help on our mission.

16:14.555 --> 16:15.890
Mission?

16:18.726 --> 16:20.811
BO-KATAN:
You see that Imperial Gozanti freighter?

16:21.729 --> 16:23.981
It's being loaded with weapons
as we speak.

16:25.107 --> 16:28.360
According to the port's manifest,
it's scheduled to depart at first light.

16:29.236 --> 16:30.613
So we stow away?

16:31.780 --> 16:33.240
We've been hitting 'em pretty hard.

16:33.699 --> 16:36.702
They scan for life forms as a precaution
before pushing back.

16:36.785 --> 16:38.787
THE MANDALORIAN:
If you wanna do this with four,

16:38.871 --> 16:40.873
you're gonna need the element of surprise.

16:41.624 --> 16:42.750
Exactly.

16:44.293 --> 16:46.253
The freighter will maintain trawling speed

16:46.337 --> 16:49.340
while inside the shipping lanes
and then ascend in orbit.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.218
We'll jet up when they're cruising
in atmosphere.

16:53.219 --> 16:56.805
The tower won't allow them to climb
until they've left the port's airspace.

16:57.348 --> 16:58.390
Troopers?

16:58.891 --> 17:00.059
A squad at most.

17:00.559 --> 17:03.229
And they couldn't hit
the side of a bantha.

17:14.823 --> 17:15.991
Something's come up.

17:16.492 --> 17:18.702
-Can I leave him with you for a bit?
-

17:20.204 --> 17:21.539
You are gonna stay here,

17:22.248 --> 17:24.166
so I want you to be respectful.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.334
And mind your manners.

17:26.627 --> 17:28.045
You know what I'm talking about.

17:30.756 --> 17:31.841
Thanks.

17:35.761 --> 17:36.971
I'll be back for him.

18:25.477 --> 18:26.604
Pirates.

18:36.155 --> 18:37.448
Pirates again.

18:43.829 --> 18:44.872
Guard that hall.

18:45.456 --> 18:46.916
-Seal the hatch.
-Yes, sir.

19:00.304 --> 19:02.056
STORMTROOPER: A breach in security.

19:02.139 --> 19:03.349
Check the exterior door.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.977
What's going on?
How many of them are there?

19:48.060 --> 19:50.229
STORMTROOPER: At least ten, maybe more.

19:50.855 --> 19:53.065
Sir, there are only four life forms.

19:53.941 --> 19:56.610
Wait. They're Mandalorian!
We've...

20:06.620 --> 20:08.080
They're headed to the cargo bay.

20:10.207 --> 20:13.794
How long until we clear the atmosphere
and can make the jump to hyperspace?

20:13.878 --> 20:16.213
We can't climb until we leave
the harbor zone, sir.

20:16.714 --> 20:17.756
Climb now.

20:19.175 --> 20:20.342
Climb now!

20:34.940 --> 20:36.483
STORMTROOPER:
Look. Over there. Stop them!

20:53.709 --> 20:54.710
STORMTROOPER: Go, go, go!

21:00.883 --> 21:02.134
What's happening?

21:02.218 --> 21:04.261
SECURITY OFFICER:
The intruders are heading your way.

21:04.887 --> 21:07.515
Just hold them off
until we can make the jump to hyperspace

21:07.598 --> 21:09.266
and rendezvous with the fleet.

21:09.350 --> 21:10.434
Copy.

21:11.018 --> 21:13.979
We need to hold them off until
we can make the jump to hyperspace.

21:33.457 --> 21:34.875
-Close the doors.
-STORMTROOPER: Sir?

21:34.959 --> 21:36.001
Close the doors!

21:37.253 --> 21:39.839
-Which one?
-All of them! All of them!

21:43.592 --> 21:46.178
Close all of them! Close all the doors!

21:57.565 --> 21:58.899
We have them trapped, sir.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.693
Trapped them where?

22:01.402 --> 22:02.778
In the cargo control area.

22:06.490 --> 22:08.993
-Where?
-In the cargo control area!

22:21.422 --> 22:22.506
Come in.

22:23.382 --> 22:24.383
Do you copy?

22:26.677 --> 22:27.887
Do you copy?

22:30.139 --> 22:31.265
I copy.

22:32.099 --> 22:34.143
Thanks for packing up all this gear
so nicely.

22:35.144 --> 22:36.770
Imagine what a division of us can do

22:36.854 --> 22:39.732
when we get our hands on
what's inside these shiny little boxes.

22:39.815 --> 22:41.567
CAPTAIN: If you think
you're going to escape

22:41.650 --> 22:44.111
with those weapons,
you are sadly mistaken.

22:44.195 --> 22:47.489
Even if you've managed to jettison
a few of those crates,

22:47.573 --> 22:52.119
we will comb the entire area
until you are hunted down and killed.

22:53.829 --> 22:55.748
Oh, we're not jettisoning anything.

22:56.415 --> 22:57.791
We're taking the entire ship.

22:58.542 --> 22:59.543
What?

23:01.587 --> 23:04.131
Put some tea on. We'll be up in a minute.

23:07.384 --> 23:09.512
THE MANDALORIAN:
This is more than I signed up for.

23:10.971 --> 23:13.724
There is something I need,
if I am to rule Mandalore.

23:13.807 --> 23:15.351
Something that was once mine.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.938
They know where it is and soon, so will I.

23:20.356 --> 23:23.025
Regardless, we are taking the ship
for the battles ahead.

23:23.108 --> 23:24.276
I got you your weapons.

23:24.944 --> 23:27.655
I have to return to my ship
with the foundling.

23:29.573 --> 23:31.992
If you want my help finding the Jedi,

23:32.868 --> 23:34.995
you will help me take this ship.

23:35.538 --> 23:37.873
You're changing the terms of the deal.

23:40.209 --> 23:41.335
This is the Way.

23:59.979 --> 24:01.564
MOFF GIDEON: What is it, Captain?

24:01.647 --> 24:04.900
-Another pirate hijacking.
-Were you able to eliminate them?

24:04.984 --> 24:07.736
No. We need backup immediately.

24:08.237 --> 24:11.782
Are these the same "pirates"
that have attacked our other vessels?

24:12.283 --> 24:14.285
They appear to be, sir.

24:15.119 --> 24:16.495
How far have they gotten?

24:16.579 --> 24:19.498
They've breached the cargo hold
and taken everything but the bridge.

24:19.582 --> 24:22.084
We require immediate backup.

24:22.168 --> 24:24.211
If they've taken that much of the ship,

24:24.962 --> 24:26.839
I'm afraid that's no longer an option.

24:28.257 --> 24:29.550
You know what to do.

24:33.762 --> 24:36.724
Long live the Empire.

24:38.809 --> 24:40.269
Long live the Empire.

25:00.748 --> 25:03.209
BO-KATAN: They're taking the ship down.
Let's move!

25:05.294 --> 25:07.671
-There's the bridge. Come on!
-STORMTROOPER: Blast 'em!

25:12.551 --> 25:13.552
BO-KATAN: How many troopers?

25:14.428 --> 25:17.014
AXE WOVES: Six to ten.
Two with heavy repeating blasters.

25:17.097 --> 25:18.599
KOSKA REEVES: We're losing altitude fast.

25:18.682 --> 25:21.560
-We need to move now.
-AXE WOVES: They have too much firepower!

25:22.228 --> 25:24.230
KOSKA REEVES:
Still dropping. Ten thousand.

25:26.941 --> 25:28.442
AXE WOVES:
We won't make it to the bridge!

25:28.526 --> 25:29.527
KOSKA REEVES: Nine thousand.

25:32.947 --> 25:34.448
Eight thousand.

25:38.035 --> 25:39.203
Seven thousand.

25:39.703 --> 25:40.704
THE MANDALORIAN: Cover me.

26:02.393 --> 26:03.394
THE MANDALORIAN: Come on!

26:20.828 --> 26:22.454
BO-KATAN: Where is it?
CAPTAIN: Where's what?

26:24.540 --> 26:26.667
BO-KATAN: The Dark saber. Does he have it?

26:26.750 --> 26:29.378
If you're asking, you already know.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.214
THE MANDALORIAN: Easy. Easy.

26:45.352 --> 26:46.937
I'll let you live.

26:47.521 --> 26:49.023
But you will take me to him.

26:49.106 --> 26:50.482
You might let me live,

26:51.483 --> 26:52.484
but he won't.

26:53.068 --> 26:54.653
-

26:54.904 --> 26:56.197
-BO-KATAN: No!
-

26:56.822 --> 26:57.865
KOSKA REEVES: We have to go.

26:58.365 --> 26:59.742
He sent a distress signal.

26:59.825 --> 27:02.119
BO-KATAN:
Clear the atmosphere and prepare to jump.

27:03.370 --> 27:05.080
Are you sure you won't join us?

27:06.081 --> 27:08.125
THE MANDALORIAN:
There's something I need to do.

27:08.209 --> 27:10.503
BO-KATAN: The offer stands
if you change your mind.

27:11.086 --> 27:13.088
THE MANDALORIAN:
Where can I find the Jedi?

27:19.011 --> 27:22.932
Take the foundling to the city of Calodan
on the forest planet of Corvus.

27:23.015 --> 27:24.892
There you will find Ahsoka Tano.

27:25.434 --> 27:27.186
Tell her you were sent by Bo-Katan.

27:28.229 --> 27:29.230
And thank you.

27:30.272 --> 27:32.024
Your bravery will not be forgotten.

27:34.026 --> 27:35.236
This is the Way.

27:36.529 --> 27:37.655
This is the Way.

27:53.796 --> 27:55.506
-

28:05.683 --> 28:07.768
THE MANDALORIAN:
Thank you for watching him.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.019
Okay, kid.

28:09.103 --> 28:10.896
Come on. It's time to go.

28:11.605 --> 28:13.232
-Let go. Come on, kid.

28:14.483 --> 28:15.776
Congratulations.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.529
-

28:18.612 --> 28:20.781
THE MANDALORIAN: No, I have enough pets.

28:37.131 --> 28:39.091
THE MANDALORIAN:
I gave you a thousand credits,

28:39.175 --> 28:40.843
this was the best you could do?

29:10.372 --> 29:11.624
Mon Calamari.

29:13.834 --> 29:15.252
Unbelievable.

30:06.804 --> 30:08.806
I finally know where I'm taking you.

30:08.889 --> 30:10.975
But it's gonna be a bumpy ride.
