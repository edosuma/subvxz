00:14.841 --> 00:16.719
Bin Laden has made
these threats before,

00:16.720 --> 00:18.848
but this time he put
a time cap on it,

00:18.849 --> 00:21.060
saying that whatever
violence awaits

00:21.061 --> 00:23.399
will occur within
the next few weeks.

00:26.530 --> 00:28.283
Deb Fletcher, Chief of Station.

00:28.284 --> 00:29.953
Hi.

00:29.954 --> 00:31.749
Come find me when you're done.

00:31.750 --> 00:33.169
I'm one floor up.

00:35.465 --> 00:38.053
You're playing our song.
Is this our song?

00:38.054 --> 00:40.266
You're playing our song.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.565
Welcome home.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.737
I really do appreciate
you coming out tonight

00:46.738 --> 00:49.366
after I had to cancel
the first time.

00:49.367 --> 00:51.955
The Bureau had two agents
assigned to Alec Station,

00:51.956 --> 00:54.085
the Bin Laden Unit of the CIA.

00:54.086 --> 00:56.339
They were supposed
to be informed of intelligence

00:56.340 --> 00:58.218
so they could report it
to John O'Neill.

00:58.219 --> 01:00.597
Shut it down. Close up shop.

01:00.598 --> 01:03.729
Sir, the way this works
is you show us what you've got,

01:03.730 --> 01:06.275
and then we discuss
if it's our business.

01:06.276 --> 01:07.862
You got a stash of intel

01:07.863 --> 01:09.240
that you refuse to share
with my agents.

01:09.241 --> 01:11.035
If we did have any intelligence,

01:11.036 --> 01:13.414
it would be for us to decide
how best to use it

01:13.415 --> 01:16.170
before you blow a possible
gold mine of information

01:16.171 --> 01:17.924
and render it utterly useless.

01:17.925 --> 01:19.635
If one American gets killed

01:19.636 --> 01:21.305
because of information
you kept secret...

02:21.093 --> 02:22.145
Hello?

03:30.425 --> 03:32.025
Well, if we can get
eight to ten agents

03:32.905 --> 03:34.948
back on the ground
in Kenya and Tanzania,

03:34.949 --> 03:37.870
how would you feel
about embedding CIA agents

03:37.871 --> 03:39.792
with the FBI from the WFO?

03:42.881 --> 03:45.009
Mr. O'Neill.

03:45.010 --> 03:47.431
To be continued.
Where's Louie Freeh?

03:47.432 --> 03:49.518
He's on vacation.
What a surprise.

03:49.519 --> 03:51.397
What can I do for you?

03:51.398 --> 03:53.609
All due respect,
this is a New York Office case,

03:53.610 --> 03:55.321
not Washington Field Office.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.534
Did you fly all the way
to D. C. To tell us that?

03:57.535 --> 03:59.371
That's right.
Well, I hate to send you

03:59.372 --> 04:01.710
right back to the airport,
but we have an attack

04:01.711 --> 04:03.588
on American interests
on foreign soil.

04:03.589 --> 04:05.175
It's WFO's case.

04:05.176 --> 04:07.137
That's what
Director Freeh would want.

04:07.138 --> 04:09.893
That decision has been made.
It's the wrong decision.

04:09.894 --> 04:11.688
Our office has got
a standing federal indictment

04:11.689 --> 04:13.357
against bin Laden.

04:13.358 --> 04:14.819
We all know this is
the work of alQaeda.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.781
We don't know that.

04:16.781 --> 04:18.534
There's been some suggestion
that it could be Hezbollah.

04:18.535 --> 04:20.664
Come on!
I know Marty wants it to be WFO

04:20.665 --> 04:22.292
so he can keep
better tabs on it.

04:22.293 --> 04:24.213
Just calm down.
Agent Soufan is gonna

04:24.214 --> 04:26.509
tell you why it's gotta be UBL.

04:26.510 --> 04:28.847
Go, Ali. Now.

04:28.848 --> 04:31.560
Sir, there has been
a preliminary claim

04:31.561 --> 04:33.231
of responsibility from.

04:33.232 --> 04:35.986
AIJaish ellslami
liTahrir alMuqadasat.

04:35.987 --> 04:39.159
"The Islamic Army for the
Liberation of the Holy Places."

04:39.160 --> 04:41.706
If I can quote to you
Agent Soufan.

04:41.707 --> 04:44.419
That is your name? It is, sir.

04:44.420 --> 04:47.384
As you continue
to work with the Bureau,

04:47.385 --> 04:49.806
you will come to realize that
there is a chain of command

04:49.807 --> 04:51.810
by which decisions are made.

04:51.811 --> 04:55.567
Your boss has yet
to learn this lesson.

04:55.568 --> 04:57.990
We are done here.

04:59.910 --> 05:01.913
And, John, submit
your airline receipts

05:01.914 --> 05:03.583
to the Bureau's
internal auditor.

05:03.584 --> 05:05.211
He'll determine
whether this trip of yours

05:05.212 --> 05:07.049
is a justifiable expense.

05:16.610 --> 05:19.741
One last thing. Sanchez.

05:19.742 --> 05:21.995
You and Louie
can go fuck yourselves.

05:21.996 --> 05:25.044
Or each other.
Whichever makes you happy.

06:12.012 --> 06:14.726
The claim also contains
the demand for the withdrawal

06:14.727 --> 06:16.938
of U. S. Forces
from the Arabian Peninsula.

06:16.939 --> 06:21.990
If you recall
the February fatwa,

06:21.991 --> 06:23.994
the retreat from
the Arabian Peninsula

06:23.995 --> 06:27.000
is a particular obsession
for bin Laden and alQaeda.

06:27.001 --> 06:29.881
It has never been remotely
as important to Hezbollah,

06:29.882 --> 06:32.678
which is Shia, not Sunni,

06:32.679 --> 06:35.684
and which is far more focused
on the ultimate elimination

06:35.685 --> 06:37.479
of the State of Israel.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.274
Those agendas seem to me

06:39.275 --> 06:41.654
disconnected from the bombings
in East Africa.

06:48.627 --> 06:50.171
For fuck's sake. Come on, Dick.

06:50.172 --> 06:52.258
We're simply arguing
for case control.

06:52.259 --> 06:54.847
We're not trying to get you
to pronounce a guilty verdict.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.560
Our office knows more
about alQaeda than anybody.

06:57.561 --> 06:59.356
WFO will be playing catchup,

06:59.357 --> 07:01.318
and they're a pawn
of Alec Station.

07:01.319 --> 07:02.822
Schmidt just wants
the case over there

07:02.823 --> 07:04.449
so he can direct it remotely.

07:04.450 --> 07:06.495
John, calm down.
II really wish people

07:06.496 --> 07:08.415
would stop telling me
to calm down!

07:08.416 --> 07:10.169
There are bombs going off
around the world!

07:10.170 --> 07:11.881
That doesn't make me feel calm!

07:11.882 --> 07:14.469
I want you to calm down
because you're right.

07:14.470 --> 07:15.931
I'm sorry? You're right.

07:15.932 --> 07:19.312
You should have this case.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.903
You're welcome.

07:22.904 --> 07:25.951
Where were you born?
Lebanon, sir.

07:25.952 --> 07:28.790
Beverly, would you get me
Louie Freeh on his cell phone?

07:28.791 --> 07:31.211
Yes, sir.

07:31.212 --> 07:33.967
He's good. Don't lose him.

07:33.968 --> 07:37.015
Director Freeh, Richard Clarke.

07:37.016 --> 07:40.063
I'm fine.
I'm here with John O'Neill.

07:44.113 --> 07:45.866
It is unusual
that he came to me,

07:45.867 --> 07:47.703
but I also think he's right.

07:47.704 --> 07:52.337
The New York office
has been tracking UBL since...

07:52.338 --> 07:56.595
Well, this young Agent Soufan
makes a very convincing case

07:56.596 --> 07:58.433
that it is alQaeda.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.651
I understand.

08:03.652 --> 08:05.781
Okay. I appreciate that.

08:05.782 --> 08:07.702
Thank you, Director.

08:10.082 --> 08:11.668
You got your case.

08:11.669 --> 08:13.462
Dick, you're the greatest.
Hang on.

08:13.463 --> 08:15.927
No, I owe you a big one.
John, hang on. Hang on!

08:17.179 --> 08:20.643
First of all, you damn well
better prove it's alQaeda.

08:20.644 --> 08:24.234
Second, the Director told me
to say that you, personally,

08:24.235 --> 08:26.405
are not permitted
to go to Africa.

08:30.288 --> 08:31.708
Okay.

08:31.709 --> 08:33.794
I'm sorry.

08:33.796 --> 08:35.881
That's a relationship you're
gonna have to work to repair.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.720
I'll take care of it.
Don't worry about it.

08:37.721 --> 08:41.226
John, whoever you do send
to East Africa,

08:41.227 --> 08:44.358
please tell them to be careful.

08:58.136 --> 09:00.139
Okay, let's settle down.

09:00.140 --> 09:04.815
Listen, most important.

09:04.816 --> 09:08.572
Remember, we are guests
in another country.

09:08.573 --> 09:11.244
Let's conduct ourselves
accordingly.

09:11.245 --> 09:14.042
Let's also remember
why we are here.

09:14.043 --> 09:17.800
Less than 36 hours ago,
some number of Americans

09:17.801 --> 09:20.638
and scores of Kenyans
were murdered.

09:20.639 --> 09:23.018
This is alQaeda territory.

09:23.019 --> 09:25.356
When investigating,
make sure you got

09:25.357 --> 09:29.280
a partner who's aware
of these sur

09:29.281 --> 09:30.408
Floyd!

09:36.254 --> 09:38.340
What.

09:38.341 --> 09:39.941
- It's goats.
- You got to be kidding me.

10:38.461 --> 10:39.922
Agent Robert Chesney.

10:39.923 --> 10:41.717
Hello, Officer Ndereba, hello.

10:41.718 --> 10:42.803
Hello.
It's good to see you again.

10:42.804 --> 10:44.514
Good to see you too.

10:44.515 --> 10:46.518
Special Agent
Robert Chesney from the FBI,

10:46.519 --> 10:48.230
meet Commander Onyango.

10:48.231 --> 10:51.528
Commander, I'm so sorry
for the loss your country

10:51.529 --> 10:53.156
has experienced.

10:53.157 --> 10:55.661
I want you to know
that we are here to help.

10:55.662 --> 10:57.415
We want to work
in friendship with you.

10:57.416 --> 10:58.669
We.

11:04.388 --> 11:08.145
We are now all Kenyan Policemen.

11:08.146 --> 11:11.651
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

11:11.652 --> 11:15.075
May I introduce Agent Bennet
and ask if he can help

11:15.076 --> 11:16.620
your officers secure
a perimeter?

11:16.621 --> 11:18.457
Please. Copy that, boss.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.586
Good, and sir, do you have
an account of the dead

11:20.587 --> 11:22.423
and wounded, one that I could
take a look at?

11:22.424 --> 11:23.926
Charles. Commander.

11:23.927 --> 11:26.641
Please. Thank you.

11:33.154 --> 11:35.449
Has there been any word
on an American woman,

11:35.450 --> 11:37.119
Deborah Fletcher?

11:37.120 --> 11:39.248
She's with the State Department
at the Embassy.

11:39.249 --> 11:41.294
I haven't heard anything
from or about her.

11:41.295 --> 11:43.465
You refer to
the CIA Chief of Station.

11:43.466 --> 11:45.177
Well... It's okay.

11:45.178 --> 11:47.014
I know you cannot say.

11:47.015 --> 11:50.479
Look, I'm sorry,
but if we knew anything,

11:50.480 --> 11:53.193
Ms. Fletcher would be
on the list.

11:53.194 --> 11:55.281
Thank you. Thank you.

11:57.411 --> 12:01.042
All right, let's get
Bomb Squad, ERT, Forensics

12:01.043 --> 12:02.921
working alongside the Kenyans.

12:02.922 --> 12:05.509
Collect soil samples,
explosives residue,

12:05.510 --> 12:07.555
find parts of the truck
and start reassembly.

12:07.556 --> 12:09.853
Yep. Will do. Thank you.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.150
Sir, did you know Deb
And let's get a group

12:13.151 --> 12:14.778
together to help dig out
from the rubble,

12:14.779 --> 12:16.782
try to save some people,
if at all possible.

12:16.783 --> 12:18.327
Yes, sir.

12:19.037 --> 12:22.043
I had a drink with her
when I was here last week.

13:30.848 --> 13:32.308
He's got nothing.

13:32.309 --> 13:34.270
He said the Kenya
and Tanzania cells

13:34.271 --> 13:36.232
were formed way after his time.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.361
We've been babysitting
this guy in witness protection

13:38.362 --> 13:39.990
for three friggin' years.

13:39.991 --> 13:42.077
He was with UBL in Sudan,
one country north.

13:42.078 --> 13:44.040
He's got no leads for us?

13:44.041 --> 13:46.294
I even threaten not to let
him watch the new porno tapes

13:46.295 --> 13:47.881
if he didn't give us something.

13:47.882 --> 13:49.467
You're taking a hard line.

13:49.468 --> 13:51.597
For Junior,
that borders on torture.

13:53.476 --> 13:55.520
I cooked him his favorite,
the pork Bolognese.

13:55.521 --> 13:57.066
Yeah, definitely not Halal.

13:57.067 --> 13:59.028
And the only thing he could
tell me was that

13:59.029 --> 14:01.491
he'd bet Khallad was involved
in the planning.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.662
This is the pegleg, right?

14:03.663 --> 14:05.123
Yep. Tell me something

14:05.124 --> 14:07.127
I don't know. This is all I get

14:07.128 --> 14:09.006
for the embarrassment
of standing in line

14:09.007 --> 14:12.012
to buy "Donkey Shlong"
and "Busty and the Beast."

14:12.013 --> 14:15.853
My goodness, Vincent,

14:15.854 --> 14:18.149
the animal penis is so long.

14:18.150 --> 14:20.405
I swear I'm gonna kill
myself if I'm here much longer.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.451
Yeah?

14:23.452 --> 14:24.871
Boss, do you have a moment?
Yeah.

14:24.872 --> 14:27.126
Vince, I gotta go. Hey, boss,

14:27.127 --> 14:29.088
why don't I come up
to the city tomorrow.

14:29.089 --> 14:30.590
We'll get some drinks
or something?

14:30.591 --> 14:32.302
Nah, in the morning,
head to Langley.

14:32.303 --> 14:33.806
See what they're up to
in the Manson Family.

14:33.807 --> 14:35.392
I need to know.

14:35.393 --> 14:37.146
What's up?

14:37.147 --> 14:39.943
I don't know how else
to say this.

14:39.944 --> 14:42.239
I think I should be there.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.285
Where's there? East Africa.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.713
We're saying it's alQaeda.

14:49.714 --> 14:52.426
If it is, I'm the only one
who speaks the language,

14:52.427 --> 14:54.848
who understands the culture
Okay, sit down.

14:54.849 --> 14:56.268
Have a seat.

15:02.072 --> 15:04.116
I have two jobs here.

15:04.117 --> 15:07.039
One is to lead investigations
into what's already happened.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.210
That's going on
in Africa right now.

15:09.211 --> 15:11.673
Okay?
The second, and maybe the more

15:11.674 --> 15:14.679
important one, is to figure out
what happens next

15:14.680 --> 15:16.725
so we can stop it.

15:16.726 --> 15:20.358
What I need you for right now
is the second.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.825
Where's the place in the world
that has

15:24.826 --> 15:26.954
the highest concentration
of alQaeda

15:26.955 --> 15:30.377
other than Afghanistan?

15:30.378 --> 15:33.759
Where they funnel media contact
with the outside world.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.345
Okay. I want you there

15:35.346 --> 15:39.062
as soon as possible.
Okay, all right.

15:48.455 --> 15:51.670
Satellite imagery's
identified eight to ten

15:51.671 --> 15:54.175
possible training camps
near the Pakistani border

15:54.176 --> 15:57.181
where UBL may be living.

15:57.182 --> 15:59.186
Possible training camps.

16:01.106 --> 16:03.484
One or two may be
Pashtun villages

16:03.485 --> 16:05.655
where the tribesmen
target practice.

16:05.656 --> 16:07.702
And you're telling me
bin Laden may be living

16:07.703 --> 16:09.622
in any one of these sites?

16:09.623 --> 16:12.502
Our estimates give us 75,
80% chance of killing UBL

16:12.503 --> 16:14.465
if we wipe out all the targets.

16:14.466 --> 16:17.554
That's assuming we destroy
everything at once so there's

16:17.555 --> 16:20.770
no chance of him disappearing
into the Hindu Kush

16:20.771 --> 16:23.943
as we target them one by one.

16:23.944 --> 16:26.364
How much collateral damage
are we talking about?

16:26.365 --> 16:28.994
Could be in the hundreds.

16:28.995 --> 16:32.125
I can confidently state
less than a thousand.

16:32.126 --> 16:33.963
That is a hell of a lot
of damage in a country

16:33.964 --> 16:35.925
that was our ally in the fight
against the Soviets.

16:35.926 --> 16:39.098
UBL was our ally in the fight
against the Soviets.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.269
The Attorney General
told George Tenet months ago

16:41.270 --> 16:43.064
that we do not have a kill
order without

16:43.065 --> 16:45.527
a Memorandum of Notification
signed by the President.

16:45.528 --> 16:47.656
Please.
And now George is worried

16:47.657 --> 16:50.412
that, without an M. O. N.,
he could be indicted for murder

16:50.413 --> 16:52.499
if we target
and assassinate bin Laden.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.838
After what he just did
in East Africa?

16:54.839 --> 16:57.175
And I will remind you
that we don't know for certain

16:57.176 --> 16:58.846
that it was alQaeda.

16:58.847 --> 17:00.850
So then why did Clarke
give the goddamn case

17:00.851 --> 17:02.980
to the New York Field Office?

17:04.607 --> 17:06.527
You know what O'Neill will do.

17:06.528 --> 17:09.491
He'll arrest the first suspects
he comes across

17:09.492 --> 17:11.329
and blow any chance
of flipping them so that

17:11.329 --> 17:13.458
we can work our way
up the chain of command.

17:13.459 --> 17:16.297
That may be. No, that will be.

17:16.298 --> 17:18.593
And then we'll just end up with
a bunch of low level turds

17:18.594 --> 17:21.473
in custody while
the leadership of alQaeda

17:21.474 --> 17:23.896
is walking blissfully around.

20:55.402 --> 20:57.908
The Body of Christ. Amen.

21:01.372 --> 21:03.126
The Body of Christ.

21:04.838 --> 21:07.509
We find ourselves
in a land where temptations

21:07.510 --> 21:12.853
are everywhere
inside each cinema, every pub.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.734
So what do we do?

21:15.735 --> 21:18.197
The Messenger of Allah,
Peace be Upon Him,

21:18.198 --> 21:22.706
teaches us of jihad alnafs
struggle of the soul.

21:22.707 --> 21:27.423
Our inner struggle of good
against the evil one, Shaytan.

21:27.424 --> 21:30.555
Then we have a duty
to turn outward,

21:30.556 --> 21:32.517
to fight the impurities
of the world,

21:32.518 --> 21:34.897
the infectious growth
of nonbelievers

21:34.898 --> 21:36.901
in the Muslim land
of the holy sites.

21:36.902 --> 21:38.612
In Mecca and Medina.

21:38.613 --> 21:40.951
In Afghanistan, in Pakistan.

21:40.952 --> 21:43.414
From jihad alnafs,
jihad of the soul,

21:43.415 --> 21:45.501
to jihad bilsaif,
jihad of the sword.

21:45.502 --> 21:48.174
All of us have this obligation.

21:49.510 --> 21:51.974
All of us.

22:19.028 --> 22:20.655
Sir.

22:20.656 --> 22:23.285
Kenyan officers
spoke to me earlier,

22:23.286 --> 22:26.751
and, after three days...
so, this morning,

22:26.752 --> 22:29.172
they begin to reassign
from Victim Recovery

22:29.173 --> 22:30.968
to other duties.

22:30.969 --> 22:32.805
I'm sorry.

22:32.806 --> 22:35.727
Boss, it's incredibly
hard in this heat

22:35.728 --> 22:38.108
to survive 72 hours
without water.

22:39.987 --> 22:41.656
Understood.

22:48.420 --> 22:51.633
Thank you for coming
to Mass with me.

22:51.634 --> 22:53.512
I told you it wouldn't hurt.

22:53.513 --> 22:55.099
And it didn't hurt, did it?

22:55.100 --> 22:58.188
Nothing I won't get over.

22:58.189 --> 23:00.109
I should get to the office,
check in.

23:00.110 --> 23:01.904
John, John...
It's been too long.

23:01.905 --> 23:06.580
You were there all night.
Just hold on a second.

23:06.581 --> 23:09.754
Okay.

23:09.755 --> 23:12.844
I know your feelings about
church are complicated.

23:14.472 --> 23:16.266
You're right.
They're... ha ha ha.

23:16.267 --> 23:18.146
They're complicated.

23:19.941 --> 23:21.651
I started everything morning,
all the way through.

23:21.652 --> 23:24.449
Jesuit High School,
going to Mass.

23:24.450 --> 23:29.584
I had a Catholic wedding,
you know, the fourhour kind.

23:29.585 --> 23:32.174
I know it's important to you.

23:34.136 --> 23:36.975
Would you ever consider
taking communion again?

23:41.819 --> 23:45.826
"Whoever eats this bread
in an unworthy manner

23:45.827 --> 23:48.707
is guilty of sinning against
the body of the Lord."

23:49.918 --> 23:52.046
Because you're divorced?

23:52.047 --> 23:54.384
That's not what Paul meant.

23:54.385 --> 23:57.892
It's about future intention,
not past sin.

23:59.896 --> 24:04.612
Hey, I admit,
for a good Catholic girl,

24:04.613 --> 24:06.868
I think it's hot that you
carry a gun,

24:06.869 --> 24:09.707
that you chase down
the bad guys for a living,

24:09.708 --> 24:12.545
but that's not why I love you.

24:12.546 --> 24:15.426
I see beneath that.

24:15.427 --> 24:17.472
I see the goodness.

24:30.081 --> 24:31.835
I gotta go to work.

24:54.088 --> 24:56.091
Agent Soofin.

24:56.092 --> 25:00.892
Soufan, Ali Soufan.

25:00.893 --> 25:02.312
Right.

25:05.568 --> 25:08.448
I was hoping your boss
would make the trip.

25:08.449 --> 25:11.496
We had a great fucking time
when I was in Manhattan last.

25:11.497 --> 25:13.500
I don't think we slept
for 40 hours.

25:13.501 --> 25:16.089
Mr. O'Neill sends his regrets.

25:16.090 --> 25:18.803
He's busy coordinating
the East Africa investigations

25:18.804 --> 25:20.056
out of New York.

25:22.019 --> 25:24.857
Where'd you say you were from?

25:24.858 --> 25:27.278
I didn't.

25:27.279 --> 25:31.537
The United States.
By way of Lebanon.

25:49.239 --> 25:54.248
Well... welcome to
the United Kingdom.

25:54.249 --> 25:55.711
Cheers.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.859
Thank you.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.446
Much appreciated.

26:14.581 --> 26:16.626
Did you happen to see this?

26:16.627 --> 26:19.758
AIQaeda claimed responsibility
for the bombings this morning

26:19.759 --> 26:21.804
in this Arab rag we got here.

26:21.805 --> 26:23.850
I did see it.

26:23.851 --> 26:26.479
They even bragged about pulling
off simultaneous bombings

26:26.480 --> 26:29.444
in separate countries.

26:29.445 --> 26:31.282
It's despicable.

26:33.286 --> 26:35.957
Shall we pay the publishers
a visit?

26:35.958 --> 26:39.339
Yeah, I think we should.

26:44.266 --> 26:46.144
Chuckie, talk to me.

26:46.145 --> 26:48.816
Toyota truck, probably rented.

26:48.817 --> 26:50.360
No VIN yet.

26:50.361 --> 26:52.198
Out of the 94 trucks
rented locally,

26:52.199 --> 26:54.035
81 have been returned.

26:54.036 --> 26:56.164
Agents are checking on
the 13 that are still out.

26:56.165 --> 26:57.876
I want that VIN number.

26:57.877 --> 26:59.922
We got parts of the doors,
dash, steering column

26:59.923 --> 27:01.341
that number's
gotta be somewhere.

27:01.342 --> 27:03.512
Tell me.
Soil, concrete fragments

27:03.513 --> 27:05.641
in the area of the truck bomb
are all testing positive

27:05.642 --> 27:07.771
for TNT and ammonium nitrate.

27:07.772 --> 27:10.275
We're estimating at least
1,800 pound of dynamite.

27:10.276 --> 27:11.862
Where would someone be able
to buy that amount

27:11.863 --> 27:13.365
of explosives? I don't.

27:13.366 --> 27:14.868
When you add the Tanzania blast,

27:14.869 --> 27:16.496
we're talking
a fuckload of materials.

27:16.497 --> 27:18.083
Get agents out with
the Kenyan Police

27:18.084 --> 27:19.418
and get me some answers.
Yes, sir.

27:19.419 --> 27:20.838
Today.

27:20.839 --> 27:23.678
No. Richard...

27:23.679 --> 27:25.430
We do not have
an unequivocal M. O. N.

27:25.431 --> 27:26.684
From the President.

27:26.685 --> 27:29.522
Until we do, the answer is no.

27:29.523 --> 27:31.694
In that case, we should
revisit the Tarnak Operation

27:31.695 --> 27:33.280
we were advocating last year.

27:33.281 --> 27:35.117
Which is? We incentivize.

27:35.118 --> 27:37.162
Pashtun tribesmen...
Cash payments, essentially.

27:37.163 --> 27:38.958
The ones who are in and out
of alQaeda encampments

27:38.959 --> 27:41.254
all the time, to kidnap UBL
from his main camp

27:41.255 --> 27:43.174
at Tarnak farms.

27:43.175 --> 27:45.095
They stash him in a safe house
in one of their villages.

27:45.096 --> 27:47.266
- After several days...
- When things calm down.

27:47.267 --> 27:49.228
We rendition him
anywhere we like.

27:49.229 --> 27:50.773
Egypt, perhaps. Where they have,

27:50.774 --> 27:52.568
shall we say, more latitude

27:52.569 --> 27:54.655
in terms of
interrogation techniques.

27:54.656 --> 27:56.702
If he dies in custody
under Mubarak,

27:56.703 --> 27:58.413
the blood's not on our hands.
And if he dies

27:58.414 --> 28:00.292
in Afghanistan resisting
the kidnapping,

28:00.293 --> 28:02.547
we haven't violated
the terms of the M. O. N.

28:04.259 --> 28:06.972
You don't even know
where bin Laden is, Martin.

28:06.973 --> 28:09.268
How can you kidnap him
when you can't find him?

28:09.269 --> 28:11.314
We blanket the
How many Pashtuns are you

28:11.315 --> 28:13.234
planning to put
on the U. S. Payroll?

28:13.235 --> 28:15.030
Just up and down the Hindu Kush,

28:15.031 --> 28:17.326
just in case the Sheikh is
in their neighborhood?

28:17.327 --> 28:19.288
How long you think
that secret will be kept?

28:19.289 --> 28:20.917
Richard
There are Pakistani teenagers

28:20.918 --> 28:23.129
who walk into alQaeda camps
every day

28:23.130 --> 28:24.800
and ask to join.

28:24.801 --> 28:27.221
How could the Agency,
after half a decade,

28:27.222 --> 28:29.141
not have one fucking spy
to tell us

28:29.142 --> 28:30.937
where bin Laden sleeps at night?

28:30.938 --> 28:32.941
If you wanna push Congress
for more funds

28:32.942 --> 28:34.695
to get agents on the ground,
please do so.

28:34.696 --> 28:37.157
Right now, I'm giving you
actionable intelligence

28:37.158 --> 28:39.328
based on
what we've gathered to date.

28:39.329 --> 28:41.124
If you don't have
the guts to proceed,

28:41.125 --> 28:42.919
that's your problem and
the President's, not mine.

28:42.920 --> 28:45.507
I'm not dealing
with ten targets.

28:45.508 --> 28:47.636
UBL's satphone
hasn't shown a signal

28:47.637 --> 28:48.973
for the last two weeks.

28:48.974 --> 28:51.437
Give me a call when it does.

28:54.861 --> 28:57.656
Every lead from most
to least credible.

28:57.657 --> 29:00.078
We adjust the rankings
depending on what we learn.

29:00.079 --> 29:02.876
Also, a number of the victims
have been stabilized

29:02.877 --> 29:04.211
at Aga Khan Hospital.

29:04.212 --> 29:05.464
They may be ready
to be interviewed,

29:05.465 --> 29:06.676
but that's your decision.

29:07.678 --> 29:09.263
Floyd, Kathy.

29:09.264 --> 29:11.601
- Mburu.
- Hold on.

29:11.602 --> 29:13.773
Comb through these
backburner leads with Mburu.

29:13.774 --> 29:15.650
See if anything jumps out
and get on it.

29:15.651 --> 29:17.529
Grab a Kenyan partner
and get out to the hospital.

29:17.530 --> 29:19.241
I want you to talk
with anyone well enough

29:19.242 --> 29:21.037
to move their mouth. Yep.

29:21.038 --> 29:22.415
Sir.

29:23.501 --> 29:26.674
They have a survivor
under the Embassy.

30:32.472 --> 30:34.558
Wait, why are you here?

30:34.559 --> 30:36.772
I'm lookin' for your boss,
Farouq Osman.

30:36.773 --> 30:38.901
Take a seat, I can see if
I can do that meself

30:38.902 --> 30:42.407
by just heading toward the door
that says "Mr. Osman" on it.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.203
What are you doing
in my offices?

30:44.204 --> 30:45.873
Mr. Osman? I am.

30:45.874 --> 30:47.626
Did you publish this today?
Of course I did.

30:47.627 --> 30:49.338
Who else would publish it?
We need to see the claim

30:49.339 --> 30:52.219
of responsibility as it came
into your possession.

30:52.220 --> 30:54.808
Well, you can show us now,
or we can go down

30:54.809 --> 30:56.979
to Scotland Yard to discuss it.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.150
I'll even give ya a free ride.

31:11.049 --> 31:15.015
What is this, fucking Mad Libs?

31:15.016 --> 31:17.561
It's a goddamn form letter.

31:17.562 --> 31:20.150
They just fill in the cities
when they decide where to bomb.

31:20.151 --> 31:21.737
When did you get this?

31:21.738 --> 31:24.033
Yesterday evening.
You can see at the top.

31:24.034 --> 31:26.245
What's this number?
Where was it sent from?

31:26.246 --> 31:28.625
I have no idea.
Somewhere in London.

31:30.797 --> 31:33.010
Does this page say what they
printed in the paper?

31:35.724 --> 31:37.143
Yes, it does.

31:38.604 --> 31:42.110
Look at this.
There's another time stamp.

31:42.111 --> 31:44.699
It's faint.
It must be where the fax

31:44.700 --> 31:46.410
was first sent
to the London number.

31:46.411 --> 31:48.164
92's the country code
for Pakistan.

31:48.165 --> 31:50.795
And hang on.
The fax was first received

31:50.796 --> 31:55.429
in London on...
7 August, 02:20 hours.

31:57.141 --> 31:58.727
With the time change,
it's five hours

31:58.728 --> 32:00.147
before the blast.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.550
Commander.

32:14.551 --> 32:17.807
Agent Chesney, please,
be careful.

32:17.808 --> 32:19.601
We removed that section
of the wall,

32:19.602 --> 32:21.147
and our dogs began to bark.

32:21.148 --> 32:22.733
We're trying to remove
the remaining slabs

32:22.734 --> 32:24.653
without further collapse.

32:24.654 --> 32:27.492
Can I would you let me speak
to whoever's in there?

32:27.493 --> 32:31.293
You should know it's a young
Kenyan man that is down there.

32:33.130 --> 32:34.967
Follow me.

32:37.597 --> 32:39.517
We're coming.

32:43.483 --> 32:45.362
We're coming.

32:51.709 --> 32:54.130
There he is. He's very weak.

32:59.599 --> 33:01.645
Can you hear me?

33:04.359 --> 33:05.694
Sir.

33:05.695 --> 33:10.536
My name is Bobby. Who are you?

33:10.537 --> 33:12.415
Simon, sir.

33:12.416 --> 33:14.671
You just hang in there, Simon.

33:14.672 --> 33:17.969
They're gonna get you out.

33:17.970 --> 33:20.014
I cannot feel my legs.

33:20.015 --> 33:22.895
Everyone here is working
to save you.

33:22.896 --> 33:25.608
You just stay strong
for me, Simon.

33:25.609 --> 33:29.074
Sir, you are American?

33:29.075 --> 33:31.788
I am.

33:31.789 --> 33:33.582
There is...

33:33.583 --> 33:36.297
a woman, sir.

33:36.298 --> 33:39.972
My boss, American, below.

33:42.518 --> 33:44.521
Is she alive?

33:44.522 --> 33:46.650
She had been talking,

33:46.651 --> 33:50.533
praying with me
to keep me alive.

33:50.534 --> 33:53.332
She stopped speaking
earlier this morning.

33:54.542 --> 33:55.836
What's her name?

33:58.467 --> 34:01.973
Simon, what's her name?

34:01.974 --> 34:03.686
Deborah Fletcher.

34:19.509 --> 34:21.637
Were you working yesterday
evening, sir?

34:21.638 --> 34:23.349
I work here all the time.

34:23.350 --> 34:26.063
If the shop is open,
I'm working.

34:26.063 --> 34:30.530
Is your fax number 204960956?

34:30.531 --> 34:32.993
Out of my memory, I
Look at your fax machine,

34:32.994 --> 34:38.088
and tell me if your number
is 204960956.

34:39.132 --> 34:40.842
Yes.

34:40.844 --> 34:44.433
Who sent this fax
at 19:43 last night?

34:44.434 --> 34:46.938
If it's sent from here,
then I suppose I have sent it.

34:46.938 --> 34:48.524
Well who paid you to send it?
I don't know, sir.

34:48.525 --> 34:49.944
What do you mean you don't know?

34:49.945 --> 34:51.864
I mean, it's less than
24 hours ago.

34:51.866 --> 34:55.079
I have so many men come in
and out into my shop.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.250
I can't keep track of them all.

34:57.251 --> 35:00.256
Yes, I can see how
that must be confusing for ya.

35:00.257 --> 35:02.970
How many faxes did you send
yesterday?

35:02.971 --> 35:04.807
I don't knowmany.

35:04.808 --> 35:06.979
Roger, have a look.

35:14.202 --> 35:15.871
Three.

35:15.872 --> 35:17.666
You sent three faxes
yesterday, and you can't

35:17.667 --> 35:19.419
recall who sent this one?

35:19.420 --> 35:21.298
Like I said, there's
so many people that come.

35:21.299 --> 35:23.511
Yes, you said that.
This fax sat here

35:23.512 --> 35:25.682
for more than two days
before it was picked up

35:25.683 --> 35:27.519
and refaxed yesterday.

35:27.520 --> 35:28.897
Sir, I don't know
if this is the case.

35:28.898 --> 35:30.901
Yeah, well,
look at the dates, look.

35:30.902 --> 35:32.821
It sat here
for two and a half days,

35:32.822 --> 35:36.746
and then it was picked up,
paid for, and then refaxed.

35:36.747 --> 35:38.542
If you say this is true.

35:41.715 --> 35:43.885
Show me your credit card
receipts from yesterday.

35:43.886 --> 35:46.431
We only accept cash, sir.

35:46.432 --> 35:48.018
Of course you do.

35:48.019 --> 35:51.441
The credit card company
treats our transaction

35:51.442 --> 35:53.362
as if we borrow money
from the bank.

35:53.363 --> 35:58.205
The Holy Quran tells us
"Allah has permitted trading,

35:58.206 --> 35:59.210
but forbidden interest."

36:06.055 --> 36:07.215
All right, mate, all right.

36:08.697 --> 36:10.297
Let's get a little breath
of fresh air.

36:11.024 --> 36:12.050
Take it outside.

36:12.848 --> 36:13.858
Come on.

36:15.421 --> 36:16.661
Come on, let's take it outside.

36:20.022 --> 36:21.042
Come on, hey? Come on.

36:23.089 --> 36:24.466
Walk away, okay?

36:24.467 --> 36:27.181
It's all right. Ya all right?

36:44.675 --> 36:46.594
Please, this way.

37:00.622 --> 37:04.672
We all sit together,
the secretaries on our floor.

37:04.673 --> 37:07.553
There was some kind
of explosion.

37:10.267 --> 37:13.898
I thought it was too loud
to be a car backfire.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.988
We rushed to the windows,
all of us.

37:16.989 --> 37:21.329
When I got there, I saw a man
running away to the streets,

37:21.330 --> 37:23.208
away from the guardhouse.

37:23.209 --> 37:26.799
I didn't even see
the truck explode,

37:26.800 --> 37:30.306
though they said
that's what happened.

37:30.307 --> 37:34.815
I woke up here, and
but everything was dark.

37:34.816 --> 37:38.740
That is the last thing
I'll ever see in my life

37:38.741 --> 37:41.329
that man after he threw
that grenade.

37:42.289 --> 37:46.254
That man, running away
up the driveway.

37:46.255 --> 37:49.427
I don't know why God
allowed this to happen.

37:49.428 --> 37:51.349
I keep asking.

38:05.544 --> 38:07.255
Stay strong. I'll come see you

38:07.256 --> 38:09.218
in the hospital soon.

38:11.305 --> 38:12.473
They knew.

38:12.474 --> 38:14.854
Hold on, hold on!

38:14.855 --> 38:16.189
Who knew?

38:16.190 --> 38:19.195
What did they know?

38:19.196 --> 38:23.453
One year ago, a man
came into the Embassy.

38:23.454 --> 38:28.589
Says he knew a plan
to blow up the building.

38:28.590 --> 38:32.597
I brought him to my boss,
to Ms. Fletcher.

38:32.598 --> 38:37.440
I'm certain she reported it
to Washington D. C.

38:37.441 --> 38:39.945
She told me she did.

38:39.946 --> 38:43.076
But nothing was done.

38:43.077 --> 38:44.873
Okay.

39:03.994 --> 39:06.707
I am really lucky.

39:06.708 --> 39:13.053
I was fairly close to the bomb,
but all I lost is just my arm.

39:13.054 --> 39:15.391
I'm going to be fine.

39:15.392 --> 39:17.603
I'm impressed by your attitude,

39:17.604 --> 39:20.944
but you do have the right
to be angry or upset.

39:20.945 --> 39:22.864
It doesn't help.

39:22.865 --> 39:25.996
You know, my children
are healthy.

39:25.997 --> 39:29.795
My wife is healthy.
I'ml'm alive.

39:29.796 --> 39:32.174
Mr. Okuku... Yes.

39:32.175 --> 39:35.514
Can you describe
for us the driver of the van?

39:35.515 --> 39:38.645
Or the man that threw
the grenade?

39:38.646 --> 39:40.984
I don't remember their faces.

39:40.985 --> 39:42.904
I'm sorry.

39:42.905 --> 39:46.787
If we brought in a sketch
artist to draw what you recall,

39:46.788 --> 39:48.833
would that help?

39:48.834 --> 39:52.007
I don't have a picture
to describe.

39:54.511 --> 40:00.857
But I do remember,
the day before,

40:00.858 --> 40:04.113
an Arab man walked up
to the guardhouse.

40:04.114 --> 40:06.911
He wanted to speak with me.

40:06.912 --> 40:10.042
He wanted to know
how I operated the metal bar

40:10.043 --> 40:13.048
for the cars to pass.

40:13.049 --> 40:15.177
I told him nothing.

40:15.178 --> 40:19.060
What do you remember about him?

40:19.061 --> 40:23.527
Most striking, he had a scar,
a large scar

40:23.528 --> 40:26.785
running down the left side
of his face.

40:29.456 --> 40:32.671
We focus today on finding
an effective response.

40:32.672 --> 40:34.675
I've given you a response.

40:34.676 --> 40:36.219
You have bombing targets
for UBL.

40:36.220 --> 40:37.848
Pull the trigger.

40:37.849 --> 40:40.854
You've given me
ten possibilities.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.108
They're woefully inadequate
and nonspecific.

40:43.109 --> 40:45.070
I told you to narrow them down.

40:45.071 --> 40:47.491
You're gonna have a hard
time convincing the military

40:47.492 --> 40:50.289
to make a strike on anything
other than highpercentage.

40:50.290 --> 40:51.583
I might remind you
that I don't need

40:51.584 --> 40:53.128
to convince the military.

40:53.129 --> 40:57.094
All I need to do
is convince the President.

40:57.095 --> 41:00.977
John, you wanna weigh in?

41:00.978 --> 41:03.481
You sure about that?

41:03.482 --> 41:06.698
That's what you're here for.
Tell me what you think.

41:08.744 --> 41:11.331
I think Marty's an analyst
who sits in a basement room

41:11.332 --> 41:13.669
and has no fucking idea
what he's proposing.

41:13.670 --> 41:16.633
I have a very good idea
what I'm proposing

41:16.634 --> 41:18.345
to eliminate the leader
of alQaeda.

41:18.346 --> 41:20.307
By carpet bombing
Afghanistan, which,

41:20.308 --> 41:22.603
I will remind you,
did not attack us.

41:22.604 --> 41:24.482
This is exactly what alQaeda
wants us to do

41:24.483 --> 41:26.653
overreact and slaughter
innocent Muslims.

41:26.654 --> 41:29.701
Well, crush the head
and the snake dies.

41:29.702 --> 41:31.371
What are you, a frickin'
Gypsy reading a fortune?

41:31.372 --> 41:33.333
We're talking about
national security.

41:33.334 --> 41:35.629
You make a martyr of UBL,
alQaeda's recruitment

41:35.630 --> 41:38.385
goes through the roof.
And you propose what?

41:38.386 --> 41:39.680
Find him. Arrest him.

41:39.681 --> 41:41.266
Put him on trial, then in jail.

41:41.267 --> 41:43.061
Treat him like a criminal,
not a hero.

41:43.062 --> 41:45.274
Well, we're at war.
Only if we choose to be.

41:45.275 --> 41:46.944
Why don't you go back
to where you belong,

41:46.945 --> 41:48.571
running protection
for the Genovese family

41:48.572 --> 41:50.158
in South Jersey.
You really wanna do this?

41:50.159 --> 41:51.577
Is that what you want?
John, please.

41:51.578 --> 41:53.540
Martin, let's get back on track.

41:53.541 --> 41:56.546
We're in new territory here.

41:56.547 --> 42:00.012
We have nonstate actors
attacking U. S. Interests.

42:00.013 --> 42:02.309
I need something I can sell
to the President.

42:06.650 --> 42:08.153
Yes?

42:08.154 --> 42:09.530
Mr. Clarke,
there's a secure call

42:09.531 --> 42:11.785
for Mr. O'Neill from Nairobi.

42:11.786 --> 42:13.246
You wanna take it
on the private phone?

42:13.247 --> 42:14.751
Yeah.

42:17.589 --> 42:20.720
Drink up.

42:20.721 --> 42:24.686
You know you don't need to
put on a show for us.

42:24.687 --> 42:26.439
Excuse me?

42:26.440 --> 42:29.403
Well, to prove you're
a different kind of Arab.

42:29.404 --> 42:30.783
I get it. We all get it.

42:33.997 --> 42:35.415
I'm not a trained Muslim monkey

42:35.416 --> 42:37.127
putting on a show for you.

42:37.128 --> 42:39.048
All right, all right,
don't get so tetchy.

42:39.049 --> 42:41.887
When people use my religion
to justify this shit,

42:41.888 --> 42:43.682
it affects me.

42:43.683 --> 42:48.608
I assure you that nothing I do
is for your benefit.

42:48.609 --> 42:50.780
I work for the U. S. Government,

42:50.781 --> 42:54.412
and I live by my own conscience.

42:54.413 --> 42:57.167
Inspector,

42:57.168 --> 42:59.171
there's a call
for the two of you

42:59.172 --> 43:01.969
on the secure line. Thank you.

43:01.970 --> 43:04.307
I'll put it through.

43:11.530 --> 43:13.491
Barry James here
with Agent Soofin.

43:13.492 --> 43:15.620
Soufan. Fuck off.

43:15.621 --> 43:17.959
Nice to hear the two of you
getting along so well.

43:17.960 --> 43:20.464
Johnny, good to hear your voice.

43:20.465 --> 43:22.092
How are things?

43:22.093 --> 43:23.721
I've been better,
as you can imagine.

43:23.722 --> 43:25.640
We got Bob Chesney
on the line in Kenya.

43:25.641 --> 43:27.812
Gentlemen, Floyd here
has compiled a list

43:27.813 --> 43:29.983
of nine men registered
in the last month

43:29.984 --> 43:33.114
on one floor
at the Hilltop Hotel.

43:33.115 --> 43:36.162
Tell me if any of these names
trip wires.

43:36.163 --> 43:40.253
Mohammed Saddiq Odeh,
Ali Abdul Saoud,

43:40.254 --> 43:43.593
Ali Azzam, Ahmed Abdelrahman,

43:43.594 --> 43:46.892
Hamden Awad, Mohamed AIOwhali,

43:46.893 --> 43:50.440
Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah,
Anas alLiby,

43:50.441 --> 43:52.277
Ali Rabia.

43:52.278 --> 43:55.534
The secondtolast name,
Anas alLiby.

43:55.535 --> 43:57.204
I recognize that
for some reason.

43:57.205 --> 44:00.001
He's under indictment in Egypt.

44:00.002 --> 44:02.506
For reasons I can't get into
on the phone,

44:02.507 --> 44:05.805
he's received political asylum
here in the U. K.

44:05.806 --> 44:07.558
I believe he lives up
in Manchester.

44:07.559 --> 44:08.936
All right,
I'm coming to England.

44:08.937 --> 44:10.815
Bob, Floyd, good work.

44:10.816 --> 44:13.486
Ali, Barry, I'll see you
tomorrow morning in Manchester.

44:13.487 --> 44:16.284
John, if you could
stay on the line for a sec.

44:16.285 --> 44:20.542
There's something I found out
you probably should know.

44:20.543 --> 44:23.256
I've been told there might have
been a walkin at the Embassy

44:23.257 --> 44:25.929
12 months ago warning of this.

44:34.571 --> 44:36.157
What the fuck did you know

44:36.158 --> 44:39.831
about a possible bombing
in Nairobi?

44:39.832 --> 44:42.754
Was there a walkin last year
at the Embassy CIA station

44:42.755 --> 44:45.175
who warned about this?
We get 40 walkins a week

44:45.176 --> 44:46.928
all over the world.

44:46.929 --> 44:49.516
They all want money
or asylum in the U. S.

44:49.517 --> 44:51.020
And lifelong protection.

44:51.021 --> 44:53.650
I don't remember
this particular one,

44:53.651 --> 44:57.075
but if it wasn't dealt with,
it was deemed noncredible.

44:58.953 --> 45:01.834
Well, I guess this one
was credible.

46:05.670 --> 46:07.380
Hi. You've reached Heather.

46:07.381 --> 46:09.384
Leave me a message,
and I'll call you back.

46:09.385 --> 46:13.392
Hi, Heather, hi.

46:13.393 --> 46:17.317
It's me, Ali. Um...

46:17.318 --> 46:20.574
I'm just calling to apologize,
again.

46:22.286 --> 46:24.623
I hope you'll consider giving
me another chance

46:24.624 --> 46:30.719
when I get back home to...
make it up to you.

46:30.720 --> 46:33.809
All right...

46:33.810 --> 46:35.478
take care.

46:35.479 --> 46:36.732
Bye.

47:00.906 --> 47:01.990
You've reached the O'Neills.

47:01.991 --> 47:03.577
Leave a message. Thanks!

47:05.456 --> 47:08.921
Maria, I'm on my way
out of the country.

47:08.922 --> 47:11.300
Hopefully not for long.

47:11.301 --> 47:15.684
I was hoping maybe when
I get back that we can talk.

47:15.685 --> 47:17.980
We've been putting this off
for too long.

47:17.981 --> 47:21.278
I think we should...

47:21.279 --> 47:23.157
talk.

47:23.158 --> 47:25.789
Kiss the girls.
I'll call another time.

47:26.791 --> 47:28.710
It is unprecedented.

47:28.711 --> 47:31.465
For the first time, a sitting
President of the United States

47:31.466 --> 47:34.889
will give grand jury testimony
in a criminal investigation

47:34.890 --> 47:37.853
and one in which he himself
may be a target.

47:37.854 --> 47:39.439
Faced with a subpoena from.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.987
Republican Special Prosecutor
Kenneth Starr,

47:41.988 --> 47:44.784
- the President agreed today...
- This is disgusting.

47:44.785 --> 47:48.165
The Monica Lewinsky case...
It's embarrassing, frankly.

47:48.166 --> 47:49.669
I think it's wonderful.

47:49.670 --> 47:51.296
It's the best thing
that could have happened

47:51.297 --> 47:53.426
to this country. The White House

47:53.427 --> 47:55.221
will be desperate to turn
people's attention

47:55.222 --> 47:57.058
away from this story, right?

47:57.059 --> 48:00.441
We can humbly be of service.

48:03.613 --> 48:05.366
We're gonna finally get Clinton

48:05.367 --> 48:08.081
to pull the fucking trigger
on alQaeda.

48:09.305 --> 48:15.683
