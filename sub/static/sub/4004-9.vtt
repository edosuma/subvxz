00:13.375 --> 00:16.417
[quirky music]

00:16.417 --> 00:24.458
â™ª â™ª

01:55.125 --> 01:56.250
- PREVIOUSLY ON DEXTER...

01:56.250 --> 01:57.875
- WE ARE GOING TO...

01:57.875 --> 01:59.375
all: TAKE IT!

01:59.375 --> 02:02.583
- COLE HARMON,
CHASE'S CHIEF OF SECURITY--

02:02.583 --> 02:04.959
TORTURER, RAPIST, KILLER.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.250
IT'S TIME TO TAP INTO
MY PRIMAL SELF.

02:07.250 --> 02:08.333
WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME?

02:08.333 --> 02:10.250
- I AM VERY INTERESTED
IN WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

02:10.250 --> 02:12.375
I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS
YOUR SITUATION IN-DEPTH

02:12.375 --> 02:13.542
AT ANOTHER TIME.

02:13.542 --> 02:15.583
- OUR INFORMANT,
YASMIN ARAGON,

02:15.583 --> 02:16.625
WAS SHOT AND KILLED.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.375
- THIS IS A FUCKING DISASTER!

02:18.375 --> 02:19.417
- IF MISTAKES WERE MADE,

02:19.417 --> 02:21.041
THEY MOST CERTAINLY
WERE NOT MINE.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.792
- I CAN CONFIRM
THAT DETECTIVE MORGAN

02:22.792 --> 02:24.333
WAS IN CHARGE
OF THE OPERATION.

02:24.333 --> 02:26.041
AS OF TODAY,
SHE'S BEING PLACED

02:26.041 --> 02:28.000
ON IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION
WITH PAY.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.041
- IT'S JUST YOUR WORD
AGAINST MINE.

02:30.041 --> 02:32.959
- SOME PEOPLE DON'T AGREE
WITH YOUR VERSION OF THE EVENTS.

02:32.959 --> 02:35.208
- WHO DID YOU GET
TO LIE FOR YOU?

02:35.208 --> 02:37.375
IT WAS YOU.

02:37.375 --> 02:38.750
- DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT THIS GIRL

02:38.750 --> 02:40.083
SHACKED UP
WITH DEXTER MORGAN?

02:40.083 --> 02:42.417
NAME: LUMEN PIERCE.

02:42.417 --> 02:45.417
LUMEN SHOWS UP HERE
IN MIAMI ONE WEEK

02:45.417 --> 02:49.333
BEFORE YOUR BOY'S WIFE,
RITA MORGAN, IS MURDERED.

02:49.333 --> 02:51.125
- AAH!

02:51.125 --> 02:52.792
- YOU FUCKIN' BITCH!

02:52.792 --> 02:54.750
[grunting]

02:54.750 --> 02:56.083
- WHO ARE THE OTHERS?

02:56.083 --> 02:58.750
- THE GUY WHO HELD A WATCH
UP TO MY EAR.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.208
TICK-TICK-TICK.

03:00.208 --> 03:02.166
"THAT'S THE SOUND
OF YOUR LIFE RUNNING OUT."

03:02.166 --> 03:04.625
- [muffled scream]

03:05.959 --> 03:08.000
- IT'S WHAT I TELL MY CLIENTS.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.291
TICK-TICK-TICK.

03:09.291 --> 03:12.417
THAT'S THE SOUND
OF YOUR LIFE RUNNING OUT.

03:12.417 --> 03:14.083
- JORDAN CHASE IS ONE OF THEM.

03:14.083 --> 03:16.208
- WE'RE GONNA TAKE DOWN
JORDAN CHASE?

03:16.208 --> 03:18.375
[camera shutter clicks]

03:30.208 --> 03:32.000
- ON A GOOD DAY,
WHEN I RUN,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.208
THE VOICES IN MY HEAD
GET QUIETER

03:34.208 --> 03:36.041
UNTIL IT'S JUST ME,
MY BREATH,

03:36.041 --> 03:39.208
AND MY FEET ON THE SAND.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.125
- PICK UP THE PACE, DEXTER.

03:46.125 --> 03:50.458
- TODAY IS NOT
ONE OF THOSE DAYS.

03:50.458 --> 03:53.083
WHEN I SCHEDULED A PRIVATE
SESSION WITH JORDAN CHASE,

03:53.083 --> 03:55.542
I WASN'T LOOKING FOR ADVICE.
JUST PROOF.

03:55.542 --> 03:59.583
EVIDENCE OF EXACTLY HOW HE WAS
INVOLVED IN LUMEN'S TORTURE,

03:59.583 --> 04:02.542
BECAUSE THE CODE
REQUIRES CERTAINTY.

04:02.542 --> 04:03.542
- FASTER, DEX.

04:03.542 --> 04:05.542
- I JUST WANTED ACCESS
TO HIS OFFICE,

04:05.542 --> 04:08.542
THE INNER SANCTUM
WHERE I COULD FIND CLUES.

04:08.542 --> 04:10.875
INSTEAD, I'M STUCK HERE,

04:10.875 --> 04:12.250
RUNNING IN PLACE.

04:12.250 --> 04:15.917
- LOOK, I GET IT.
YOU'RE FRUSTRATED.

04:15.917 --> 04:18.291
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT GETTING
WHAT YOU CAME HERE FOR.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.125
- YEAH, A BIT.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.875
- INTENSE EXERCISE WORKS.

04:21.875 --> 04:26.083
TEARS DOWN YOUR DEFENSES,
BRINGS OUT YOUR FEELINGS.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.291
- WELL, I HAVE THE FEELING
THAT I'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE

04:28.291 --> 04:29.792
TALKING ON A COUCH.

04:29.792 --> 04:33.417
[both panting]

04:33.417 --> 04:36.583
- TRUST ME, THIS IS THE WAY
TO BUILD A NEW YOU.

04:38.667 --> 04:41.709
AT THE SEMINAR,
WE WENT OVER HOW

04:41.709 --> 04:43.625
TRAGEDY FRACTURES US, RIGHT?

04:43.625 --> 04:44.792
- YEAH.

04:44.792 --> 04:46.917
WE'RE LIKE HUMPTY DUMPTY.

04:46.917 --> 04:48.041
AND THE BIG FALL.

04:48.041 --> 04:49.375
- WHAT I'M TELLING YOU NOW

04:49.375 --> 04:52.959
IS TRAUMA
IS ALSO OPPORTUNITY.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.792
TRAGEDY TEARS US APART, SURE.

04:55.792 --> 04:58.291
BUT IT'S YOUR ONE CHANCE
TO RECREATE YOURSELF.

04:58.291 --> 04:59.917
YOU GET TO PUT YOURSELF
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN

04:59.917 --> 05:01.083
ANY WAY YOU WANT.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.417
- [slight chuckle]
OKAY.

05:03.417 --> 05:05.583
- DON'T BE SKEPTICAL.
I KNOW IT FOR A FACT.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.500
- HOW?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

05:08.500 --> 05:10.375
- YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT ME.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.083
- SOMETHING BIG
MUST HAVE HAPPENED

05:12.083 --> 05:14.000
IF IT INSPIRED
YOUR ENTIRE PHILOSOPHY.

05:17.792 --> 05:20.125
- OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE IT STARTED

05:20.125 --> 05:21.750
IF YOU PROMISE
TO KEEP IT BETWEEN US.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.625
- PLATO.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.542
- WHAT?

05:27.542 --> 05:29.417
- THE NOTION
OF A FRACTURED SELF.

05:29.417 --> 05:31.458
IT'S FROM PLATO'S SYMPOSIUM.
YOU EVER READ IT?

05:31.458 --> 05:33.792
- MAYBE IN COLLEGE.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.166
- BUT YOU DON'T REMEMBER IT,
RIGHT?

05:35.166 --> 05:36.500
MOST PEOPLE DON'T.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.750
BUT FOR ME,
IT WAS A REVELATION.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.959
IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT
I NEEDED AT THE TIME.

05:40.959 --> 05:44.375
SO...I TOOK IT.

05:44.375 --> 05:46.834
I TOOK PLATO'S IDEA
THAT WE ARE FRACTURED CREATURES,

05:46.834 --> 05:49.166
TRYING TO BECOME WHOLE,
AND I RAN WITH IT.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.500
BOOM, A MILLION COPIES SOLD.

05:55.834 --> 05:58.083
SO...NOW YOU KNOW MY SECRET.

05:58.083 --> 06:00.875
YOU READY
TO TELL ME YOURS?

06:02.875 --> 06:05.417
- OVER YOUR DEAD BODY.

06:05.417 --> 06:07.875
AN HOUR ON THE TREADMILL,
AND I CAME UP EMPTY.

06:07.875 --> 06:09.834
NOT A CLUE.

06:09.834 --> 06:12.834
ONLY UPSIDE IS I GOT IN
MY CARDIO FOR THE DAY.

06:12.834 --> 06:15.125
JORDAN IS ONE TOUGH NUT
TO CRACK.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.000
- YOU'RE ONE TOUGH NUT TO CRACK,
YOU KNOW THAT, DEXTER?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.458
- I WISH
HE'D STOP DOING THAT.

06:19.458 --> 06:22.709
- WE RAN FOR AN HOUR.
YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP ANYTHING.

06:22.709 --> 06:24.041
I KNOW
YOU'RE IN KILLER SHAPE,

06:24.041 --> 06:25.667
BUT YOU CAN'T
OUTRUN ME FOREVER.

06:25.667 --> 06:28.959
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME
SOMETHING TO WORK WITH.

06:28.959 --> 06:31.166
OTHERWISE...

06:31.166 --> 06:32.208
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

06:32.208 --> 06:34.542
- MAYBE YOU CAN'T.

06:34.542 --> 06:36.625
OR MAYBE YOU CAN.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.333
IS THAT BLOOD?

06:40.709 --> 06:41.834
- NO PRESSURE.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.834
IT CAN TAKE
SEVERAL MEETINGS

06:43.834 --> 06:45.250
FOR US TO HAVE
A REAL BREAKTHROUGH.

06:45.250 --> 06:47.458
BUT I DO NEED
YOUR COMMITMENT.

06:47.458 --> 06:49.333
- I NEED TO GET MY HANDS
ON THAT VIAL.

06:49.333 --> 06:52.834
- OTHERWISE, WE'RE JUST
WASTING OUR TIME.

06:52.834 --> 06:55.667
I REALLY THINK
I CAN HELP YOU, THOUGH.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.083
- I THINK SO TOO.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.083
WHEN CAN I GET IN
TO SEE YOU AGAIN?

06:59.083 --> 07:00.917
- CHECK WITH MY RECEPTIONIST
ON THE WAY OUT.

07:00.917 --> 07:03.375
I THINK I MAY HAVE AN OPENING
TOMORROW MORNING.

07:10.041 --> 07:13.041
[keyboard keys clicking]

07:15.500 --> 07:16.542
- WELL, THAT WAS LUCKY.

07:16.542 --> 07:18.375
10:00 A.M. TOMORROW.

07:18.375 --> 07:21.000
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.917
- PERFECT.
- SEE YOU TOMORROW.

07:23.917 --> 07:26.083
- I DIDN'T NOTICE YOU LAST TIME.
YOU NEW HERE?

07:26.083 --> 07:27.583
- JUST STARTED THREE DAYS AGO.

07:27.583 --> 07:30.458
- I DON'T REMEMBER
SO MUCH SECURITY EITHER.

07:30.458 --> 07:33.792
- MR. CHASE SAYS
HE'S BEEFING THINGS UP.

07:33.792 --> 07:35.625
- THAT'S NO SURPRISE.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.834
LUMEN AND I HAVE BEEN
KNOCKING OFF HIS FRIENDS

07:37.834 --> 07:40.083
ONE BY ONE.

07:41.542 --> 07:43.333
- HOW MANY SECURITY GUARDS?

07:43.333 --> 07:45.583
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE A DOZEN.

07:45.583 --> 07:47.000
- BUT YOU THINK
THAT YOU CAN STILL

07:47.000 --> 07:48.792
GET TO THE BLOOD
NECKLACE THING, RIGHT?

07:48.792 --> 07:50.667
- YEAH. WHILE JORDAN'S
IN THE SHOWER.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.792
- WON'T HE NOTICE
IF IT'S MISSING?

07:52.792 --> 07:54.041
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA SWIPE IT.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.959
I'M JUST GONNA EXTRACT
A SAMPLE.

07:55.959 --> 07:58.083
I'LL RUN IT FOR DNA,
HOPEFULLY GET AN I.D.

07:58.083 --> 07:59.792
- RUN IT FOR DNA.

07:59.792 --> 08:02.542
GOD, I LOVE THAT
YOU CAN DO THAT.

08:02.542 --> 08:04.709
SO WHOSE BLOOD
DO YOU THINK IT IS?

08:04.709 --> 08:07.625
IF IT IS BLOOD.
- MOST LIKELY A VICTIM.

08:07.625 --> 08:09.291
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIM.

08:09.291 --> 08:11.500
HE'S WEARING IT AROUND HIS NECK.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.291
IT'S DEFINITELY
SOME KIND OF TROPHY.

08:16.041 --> 08:18.333
ARE YOU THERE?

08:18.333 --> 08:20.333
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.500
- THERE'S SOMEONE
AT THE KITCHEN DOOR.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.417
[knob rattles]

08:24.417 --> 08:26.583
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET IN.
- GO OUT THE FRONT DOOR.

08:26.583 --> 08:29.417
I'LL BE THERE
IN A FEW MINUTES.

08:29.417 --> 08:31.375
- DEXTER, THERE'S SOMEONE
THERE TOO.

08:31.375 --> 08:32.500
- HIDE.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.166
- WHERE?
- IN THE BATHROOM.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.792
I'LL GET THERE
AS FAST AS I CAN.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.500
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

08:46.500 --> 08:48.750
[hinges creak]

08:48.750 --> 08:50.667
[door closes quietly]
- [whispers] THEY'RE INSIDE.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.125
- WHAT?

08:59.125 --> 09:00.500
- THEY'RE COMING!

09:00.500 --> 09:03.667
- PUT THE PHONE DOWN.
LEAVE THE LINE OPEN.

09:09.834 --> 09:12.709
[footsteps approach slowly]

09:20.166 --> 09:22.041
[breathing heavily]

09:22.041 --> 09:23.208
[hinges creak]

09:23.208 --> 09:24.834
[all scream]

09:24.834 --> 09:26.208
[glass shatters]

09:26.208 --> 09:27.875
- JESUS!

09:27.875 --> 09:29.125
- WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?

09:29.125 --> 09:30.417
- WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?

09:30.417 --> 09:32.875
- WHO THE FUCK IS SHE?

09:32.875 --> 09:35.083
- YOU WANNA TRY THAT AGAIN,
ASTOR?

09:35.083 --> 09:37.542
- WHO IS SHE?

09:37.542 --> 09:39.458
- HER NAME IS LUMEN.

09:39.458 --> 09:41.375
- I MEAN WHO IS SHE?
WHY IS SHE HERE?

09:41.375 --> 09:44.250
- SHE'S...RENTING THE HOUSE.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.417
- YOU SAID THE HOUSE
WAS EMPTY.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.917
- THOUGHT IT WAS.

09:47.917 --> 09:50.709
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
HE GOT A GIRLFRIEND SO FAST?

09:50.709 --> 09:51.959
- FIRST OF ALL,
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.917
SHE'S A TENANT,
LIKE I SAID.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.625
SECOND OF ALL,
WHO ARE YOU?

09:55.625 --> 09:59.667
- I'M OLIVIA.
I LIVE NEAR HER GRANDPARENTS.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.709
- ANYONE WANNA TELL ME
HOW YOU GOT HERE?

10:01.709 --> 10:03.083
- TAXI.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.542
- IT'S 215 MILES.

10:04.542 --> 10:07.750
- [snickers]
FROM A BUS STATION.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.917
- WHERE'D YOU GET THE LIQUOR?

10:10.917 --> 10:13.500
- DOES IT MATTER?
- YEAH, I'D SAY SO.

10:13.500 --> 10:17.125
YOU'RE 12.
- YOU SAID YOU WERE 14!

10:17.125 --> 10:18.917
- THANKS A LOT.

10:18.917 --> 10:22.792
- IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW,
WE STOLE IT FROM MY HOUSE.

10:22.792 --> 10:24.750
- THAT'S REASSURING.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.291
- I THINK I NEED TO SIT DOWN.

10:30.709 --> 10:33.458
DO YOUR PARENTS KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE?

10:33.458 --> 10:35.125
- MY MOM THINKS
I'M AT ASTOR'S.

10:35.125 --> 10:36.625
- OH. LET ME GUESS,

10:36.625 --> 10:38.625
YOUR GRANDPARENTS THINK
YOU'RE AT OLIVIA'S.

10:38.625 --> 10:40.458
- DON'T CALL 'EM.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.417
PLEASE.

10:42.417 --> 10:44.750
AT LEAST NOT UNTIL
TOMORROW.

10:44.750 --> 10:48.709
- THEY SHOULD REALLY
STAY THE NIGHT AND SOBER UP.

10:48.709 --> 10:50.166
- THEN I'LL STAY TOO.

10:50.166 --> 10:52.834
- WITH HER?

10:52.834 --> 10:54.792
OH.

10:54.792 --> 10:56.291
I THINK I'M GONNA--

10:56.291 --> 10:59.208
[vomiting]

10:59.208 --> 11:01.458
- HERE. COME WITH ME.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.792
I'LL GET YOU TO BED, OKAY?

11:11.458 --> 11:12.834
- [grunts]

11:14.709 --> 11:17.834
- QUITE A SITUATION
WE HAVE HERE.

11:17.834 --> 11:20.291
- UNLESS YOU HAVE ADVICE
ON DEALING WITH TEENAGED GIRLS,

11:20.291 --> 11:21.959
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

11:21.959 --> 11:24.458
- MY ADVICE--
GET ASTOR OUT OF HERE.

11:24.458 --> 11:27.041
TOMORROW MORNING
YOU'RE COLLECTING EVIDENCE

11:27.041 --> 11:29.834
ON A VIOLENT MURDERER
YOU PLAN TO KILL.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.959
YOU REALLY WANT A HUNG-OVER
PRETEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT?

11:31.959 --> 11:34.834
- SHE CAME HERE.
- DRUNK!

11:34.834 --> 11:36.333
- I CAN'T JUST TURN HER AWAY.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.500
- DEXTER, THERE'S A REASON

11:38.500 --> 11:40.250
SERIAL KILLERS
DON'T HAVE CHILDREN.

11:40.250 --> 11:43.750
YOU CAN'T BE KILLER AND DAD.
HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED ANYTHING?

11:43.750 --> 11:45.750
HER MOTHER IS DEAD
BECAUSE OF YOU.

11:45.750 --> 11:47.417
- WHICH IS WHY
I NEED TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT

11:47.417 --> 11:48.959
AND BE A GOOD FATHER.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.375
- A GOOD FATHER
WOULD GET THOSE GIRLS

11:50.375 --> 11:53.333
AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.166
- HARRISON'S STILL
AT THE APARTMENT WITH SONYA.

12:01.166 --> 12:03.709
I'M GONNA GO GET HIM,
BRING HIM BACK HERE.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.834
[cabinet doors clacking]

12:12.917 --> 12:15.375

12:15.375 --> 12:17.208
YOU'RE GONNA BREAK SOMETHING.
RELAX.

12:17.208 --> 12:18.542
- YOU RELAX.
YOU'RE NOT ABOUT TO HAVE

12:18.542 --> 12:20.333
THE WORST MEETING
OF YOUR CAREER.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.333
- IT'S A UNION REP.
HE'S ON YOUR SIDE.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.834
YOU KNOW, JUST BE PROFESSIONAL
AND DON'T FREAK OUT

12:24.834 --> 12:26.375
UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

12:26.375 --> 12:28.709
- I KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
I'M GONNA GET FIRED--

12:28.709 --> 12:29.834
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.542
EVEN LAGUERTA SAID
THIS ISN'T GONNA STICK.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.750
- I'M SUPPOSED TO TRUST HER?
- NO.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.375
BUT YOU CAN TRUST ME.

12:36.375 --> 12:38.166
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.959
YOU KNOW WHY?

12:39.959 --> 12:41.792
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR JOB BACK.

12:41.792 --> 12:43.583
YOU GOEVERYONE
AT THE STATION ON YOUR SIDE.

12:43.583 --> 12:45.917
YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND
WHO LOVES YOU.

12:45.917 --> 12:47.208
- [laughs]

12:49.750 --> 12:52.792
SERIOUSLY? YOU'RE GONNA
DROP THAT ON ME NOW?

12:52.792 --> 12:54.875
- IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION.
IT SLIPPED OUT.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.792
- I GOTTA GO.
- FINE. FORGET I SAID IT.

13:00.917 --> 13:02.959

SUNSHINE.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.917
YOU ALONE?
- YEAH. WHAT'S UP?

13:08.917 --> 13:10.750
- YOUR PECKER.
SOON AS YOU TAKE A LOOK

13:10.750 --> 13:13.959
AT THESE SNAPS I TOOK
OF YOUR BOY DEXTER MORGAN

13:13.959 --> 13:17.625
AND HIS GAL PAL ON SOME KIND OF
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BOAT RUN.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.667
WANNA MEET FOR A BEER?
- IT'S 7:00 A.M.

13:19.667 --> 13:20.959
- BEER IS GOOD ANYTIME.

13:20.959 --> 13:23.959
- YEAH. I GOTTA WORK.
- THEN I'LL COME TO YOU.

13:23.959 --> 13:26.000
- WHAT'D I JUST SAY?
I CAN'T NOW!

13:26.000 --> 13:27.750
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.625
- [pops tongue]

13:46.458 --> 13:49.375
- YOU SURE YOU WANNA KEEP
YOUR APPOINTMENT WITH JORDAN?

13:49.375 --> 13:51.125
- WELL, I NEED TO.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.959
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ANOTHER
CHANCE TO GET THE BLOOD.

13:53.959 --> 13:57.542
BESIDES, IT'S SOMETHING
I ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO DO.

13:57.542 --> 14:00.834
YOU WERE A TEENAGED GIRL,
RIGHT?

14:00.834 --> 14:03.041
HOW DO I DEAL WITH ASTOR?

14:03.041 --> 14:04.667
- TRY TALKING TO HER.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.041
- LAST TIME I DID THAT,

14:06.041 --> 14:07.917
SHE SAID SHE HATED ME
AND MOVED TO ORLANDO.

14:07.917 --> 14:09.834
- WELL, NOW YOU GET
A SECOND CHANCE.

14:14.667 --> 14:16.834
SHARE SOMETHING WITH HER...

14:16.834 --> 14:18.083
WHAT YOU DID
WHEN YOU WERE HER AGE.

14:18.083 --> 14:19.667
- I KILLED
THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG.

14:19.667 --> 14:22.834
- WELL, DON'T TELL HER THAT.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.667
[door opens]

14:24.667 --> 14:26.417
- SERIOUSLY, WHAT DO I DO?

14:26.417 --> 14:28.875
- JUST...CUT HER SOME SLACK.

14:28.875 --> 14:31.041
ALL KIDS THAT AGE
MAKE MISTAKES.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.834
TRUST ME, THE HANGOVER
WILL BE PUNISHMENT ENOUGH.

14:33.834 --> 14:37.917
- OH, IS THAT YOUR BROTHER?

14:37.917 --> 14:40.875
- HARRISON.

14:40.875 --> 14:43.917
HE DOESN'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE ME.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.583
- WELL...YOU DIDN'T LOOK
LIKE A RACCOON

14:46.583 --> 14:49.083
THE LAST TIME HE SAW YOU.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.709
- EAT.
IT'S HANGOVER FOOD.

14:54.709 --> 14:57.083
IT'LL SOAK UP THE ALCOHOL.

14:57.083 --> 14:59.500
- TALK TO HER.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.333
SHARE SOMETHING.

15:02.333 --> 15:06.709
SO I NEED TO GO
TO A MEETING IN A FEW MINUTES.

15:06.709 --> 15:09.291
BUT I WAS HOPING AFTER THAT

15:09.291 --> 15:11.041
WE COULD SPEND
THE DAY TOGETHER,

15:11.041 --> 15:15.083
'CAUSE WE REALLY SHOULD TALK.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.583
SO IS THAT OKAY?

15:19.583 --> 15:21.834
- CAN HARRISON COME?

15:21.834 --> 15:23.250
- SURE.
I'LL CALL THE BABYSITTER,

15:23.250 --> 15:25.083
TELL HER
THERE'S A CHANGE OF PLANS.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.542
- MAMA.

15:38.417 --> 15:40.083
MAMA.

15:41.625 --> 15:43.917
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY HE SAID THAT.

15:43.917 --> 15:46.500
I BARELY KNOW HIM.
- STOP LYING, OKAY?

15:46.500 --> 15:49.125
I'M NOT STUPID.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.792
SHE'S NOT YOUR MAMA.

15:51.792 --> 15:54.917
YOUR MAMA'S DEAD.
- ASTOR.

15:54.917 --> 15:56.792
- I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

15:56.792 --> 15:58.625
IF YOU WERE THE ONE WHO DIED,

15:58.625 --> 16:00.125
I REALLY DOUBT
MY MOM WOULD HAVE

16:00.125 --> 16:02.750
BROUGHT IN A TENANT
SO FAST.

16:06.917 --> 16:09.291
- I SHOULD GO.
- I KNOW.

16:09.291 --> 16:11.125
- WE'LL ONLY BE
A COUPLE HOURS.

16:11.125 --> 16:12.792
- I CAN HANDLE IT.

16:16.625 --> 16:19.959
- MY FAMILY
IS PRETTY WEIRD TOO.

16:25.792 --> 16:26.917
- HEY.

16:36.959 --> 16:39.000
- HOW'D IT GO
WITH THE UNION SUIT?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.458
- THEY'RE STICKING ME
IN THE FILE ROOM.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.041
TILL AFTER MY HEARING.

16:43.041 --> 16:45.125
- YOU'RE NOT FIRED.
IT'S GOOD NEWS.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.333
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

16:46.333 --> 16:47.875
EXCEPT EVERYBODY
STILL THINKS

16:47.875 --> 16:50.000
I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT GIRL DYING

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
AND ALL THOSE KIDS GETTING
WOUNDED IN THAT NIGHTCLUB.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.792
- FOR THE RECORD,

16:54.792 --> 16:57.166
MY REPORT
BACKED YOUR STORY 100%.

16:57.166 --> 16:58.959
NOT THAT IT MATTERED.

16:58.959 --> 17:00.792
THE BRASS BACKED MY WIFE.

17:00.792 --> 17:03.000
- MATTERS TO ME.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.667
THANK YOU.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.750
ANYBODY NEEDS
A REAL FUCKING DETECTIVE,

17:08.750 --> 17:11.125
I'LL BE IN THE FILE ROOM.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.333
DETECTIVE SCAPEGOAT
REPORTING FOR DUTY.

17:16.333 --> 17:19.375
- [chuckling]
THEY SAID YOU'D BE JOINING ME.

17:19.375 --> 17:22.834
COME ON.
I CAN GET YOU STARTED.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.041
RIGHT OVER THERE.

17:25.041 --> 17:28.208
SO...HOW'S IT GOING
WITH THAT MAN OF YOURS?

17:28.208 --> 17:30.875
- THIS MORNING
OUT OF THE BLUE, HE...

17:30.875 --> 17:32.375
TOLD ME HE LOVED ME.

17:32.375 --> 17:33.458
- OH!

17:33.458 --> 17:34.542
YOU SAY IT BACK?

17:34.542 --> 17:36.291
- NO. I RAN.

17:36.291 --> 17:37.959
- WHAT? WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

17:37.959 --> 17:39.542
YOU DON'T FEEL THE SAME WAY?

17:39.542 --> 17:41.208
- NO, THE PROBLEM IS
IS THAT...

17:41.208 --> 17:43.625
I'M AFRAID I MIGHT.
[laughs]

17:43.625 --> 17:45.041
- OH!
[chuckling]

17:45.041 --> 17:46.750
- WHAT IS THIS,
THE BARREL GIRLS CASE?

17:46.750 --> 17:49.750
FILE IT UNDER CREEPY?
- UNDER CLOSED CASES.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.667
NOT READ, HONEY. FILE.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.166
THAT'S WHAT I GET PAID TO DO,

17:53.166 --> 17:55.709
AND FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS,

17:55.709 --> 17:57.542
[whispers] SO DO YOU.

17:57.542 --> 18:00.000
[chuckling]

18:09.917 --> 18:11.083
- GOOD SESSION.

18:11.083 --> 18:13.625
- ANOTHER HOUR
OF RUNNING IN PLACE.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.166
- YOU SEEM MORE OPEN.
YOU FEEL THE DIFFERENCE?

18:16.166 --> 18:17.375
- YEAH.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.041
I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT...

18:19.041 --> 18:21.417
TAKE AWAY SOMETHING VALUABLE
THIS TIME.

18:21.417 --> 18:23.750
- MM. GOOD.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.834
WELL, I GOTTA TELL YA.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.542
I STILL FEEL LIKE

18:27.542 --> 18:30.083
YOU'RE NOT BEING
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ME.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.542
- REALLY?
[water turns on]

18:34.542 --> 18:37.333
'BOUT WHAT?
- ABOUT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT.

18:37.333 --> 18:38.917
- WHAT I REALLY WANT...

18:38.917 --> 18:41.208
JUST A DROP.

18:41.208 --> 18:43.709
A 30-GAUGE NEEDLE SHOULD
SLIDE RIGHT IN UNDETECTED.

18:43.709 --> 18:46.083
[water continues running]

18:46.083 --> 18:48.625
HE WON'T EVEN NOTICE
IT'S MISSING.

18:48.625 --> 18:50.917
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:50.917 --> 18:53.750
- WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE.

18:53.750 --> 18:55.625
WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME

18:55.625 --> 18:58.458
SO THAT I CAN HELP YOU
CONSTRUCT A PLAN TO GET THERE.

18:58.458 --> 19:00.000
- I HAVE A PLAN TO GET THERE.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.959
LUMEN AND I FOLLOW
THIS BLOOD TRAIL.

19:01.959 --> 19:03.291
WE TAKE YOU OUT.

19:03.291 --> 19:06.750
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
YOU'RE HELPING ME ALREADY.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.709
- I HOPE SO.
I REALLY DO.

19:09.709 --> 19:11.125
[water running]

19:12.875 --> 19:14.417
[faucet squeaks,
water stops]

19:16.959 --> 19:19.208
EACH OF US...

19:19.208 --> 19:21.458
DEEP DOWN,
WE KNOW WHAT WE REALLY WANT.

19:21.458 --> 19:24.542
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF ACTUALLY DOING IT.

19:24.542 --> 19:25.500
- YEAH.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.875
OH.
I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK.

19:29.875 --> 19:32.333
NEW EVIDENCE TO PROCESS.

19:32.333 --> 19:35.291
BUT, UH, THANKS AGAIN
FOR EVERYTHING.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.375
- SO WHEN'S OUR NEXT
APPOINTMENT?

19:37.375 --> 19:40.291
- I'LL CHECK WITH
THE RECEPTIONIST.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.875
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

20:39.875 --> 20:41.875
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
FILING THINGS AWAY,

20:41.875 --> 20:44.667
NOT MAKIN' A MESS.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.291
- WAIT, WAIT.
I WAS READING THAT.

20:46.291 --> 20:49.667
- YEAH, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
- JUST GIVE ME ONE MORE SECOND.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.250
HOLY SHIT!
LOOK AT THIS.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.917
- WHAT AM I LOOKIN' AT?

20:56.917 --> 20:59.917
- DNA RESULTS.
MULTIPLE DNA RESULTS.

20:59.917 --> 21:02.000
THE BARREL GIRLS CASE?
- MM-HMM.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.250
- WE PINNED THIS ON ONE GUY
AND...

21:05.250 --> 21:07.917
LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE
MULTIPLE PERPS.

21:07.917 --> 21:10.625
I'M JUST GONNA...

21:10.625 --> 21:12.250
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

21:12.250 --> 21:15.083
- DNA SEQUENCING REPORT,
UH...

21:15.083 --> 21:17.917
PARTIAL SEQUENCES ON THREE,
MAYBE FOUR PERPS?

21:17.917 --> 21:19.875
- WHAT CASE IS THIS?

21:19.875 --> 21:21.750
- BARREL GIRLS.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.792
- DIDN'T WE...DIDN'T WE
PIN THIS ON ONE GUY?

21:23.792 --> 21:25.417
- YES. BOYD FOWLER.

21:25.417 --> 21:28.041
BUT THE CORONER FOUND
TRACE DNA ON THE GIRLS

21:28.041 --> 21:29.792
THAT WASN'T BOYD'S.

21:29.792 --> 21:32.417
THERE WERE PARTIAL SEQUENCES
FROM MULTIPLE PEOPLE.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.208
IT'S ALL IN THE FILE.

21:34.208 --> 21:36.709
- WHY AM I ONLY HEARING
ABOUT THIS NOW?

21:36.709 --> 21:39.333
- BECAUSE BY THE TIME THE FINAL
CORONER REPORT CAME THROUGH,

21:39.333 --> 21:40.917
WE'D ALREADY CLOSED THE CASE.

21:40.917 --> 21:42.458
THE ONLY REASON
I CAME ACROSS THIS

21:42.458 --> 21:44.250
WAS BECAUSE I WAS
FILING IT ALL AWAY.

21:44.250 --> 21:46.375
LOOK.

21:46.375 --> 21:49.250
THIS IS COLE HARMON,
OUR ORIGINAL SUSPECT.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.417
JORDAN CHASE'S SECURITY GUY.
WE LET HIM GO.

21:51.417 --> 21:55.125
WE GOT DNA SAMPLES ON HIM.
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.291
- THERE ARE ENOUGH
COMMON MARKERS

21:57.291 --> 21:59.125
THAT COLE HARMON
IS LOOKING PRETTY GOOD

21:59.125 --> 22:01.208
FOR THE BARREL GIRLS' MURDERS.

22:01.208 --> 22:02.709
AT THE VERY LEAST,
HE CAN'T BE EXCLUDED.

22:02.709 --> 22:05.542
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, THAT COLE
AND BOYD DID THIS TOGETHER?

22:05.542 --> 22:07.625
- YEAH.

22:07.625 --> 22:10.959
WITH MAYBE THREE
OR FOUR OTHERS.

22:10.959 --> 22:13.375
- WE GOTTA REOPEN THIS CASE.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.291
- I KNOW.
BUT I CAN'T TELL LAGUERTA.

22:16.291 --> 22:18.333
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
ON FILE CLERK DUTY.

22:21.041 --> 22:23.000
- WH--I'M NOT TELLIN' HER.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.333
THIS CASE WAS SOLVED.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.417
IF I ASK HER TO REOPEN IT,

22:27.417 --> 22:29.500
I MAY AS WELL PUT
MY BALLS IN A VICE.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.166
AND NOT IN A HOT WAY EITHER.

22:32.166 --> 22:35.792
- WELL, THAT JUST LEAVES...ME.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.834
- HEY. YOU'RE LATE.

22:48.834 --> 22:51.166
- YEAH. TOUGH MORNING.

22:51.166 --> 22:54.333
ASTOR SHOWED UP
ON MY DOORSTEP LAST NIGHT

22:54.333 --> 22:56.333
DRUNK WITH A FRIEND.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.000
- HOW OLD'S THE FRIEND?

23:00.458 --> 23:02.500
JUST KIDDING.

23:07.792 --> 23:09.375
WHAT'S THAT?
BLOOD SAMPLE?

23:09.375 --> 23:11.500
- YES. IT'S A BLOOD SAMPLE.

23:14.166 --> 23:15.834
- TOP SECRET, HUH?
I GET IT.

23:15.834 --> 23:19.667
SO...WHAT IS IT?
BLOOD ALCOHOL FOR ASTOR?

23:19.667 --> 23:21.333
- SHE VOMITED
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.458
FURTHER TESTING'S
KIND OF UNNECESSARY.

23:23.458 --> 23:25.834
- STD PANEL?

23:25.834 --> 23:27.625
- VINCE, SHE'S 12.

23:27.625 --> 23:29.041
- I MEANT FOR YOU.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.959
[cell phone rings]

23:30.959 --> 23:32.667
- IT'S A HOMICIDE VICTIM

23:32.667 --> 23:34.875
I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE
PROCESSED ALREADY.

23:34.875 --> 23:38.625
I MADE A MISTAKE,
FORGOT TO SUBMIT IT, OKAY?

23:38.625 --> 23:40.250
MORGAN.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.291
- DEXTER, THE GIRLS ARE GONE.

23:42.291 --> 23:44.417
- GONE WHERE?

23:44.417 --> 23:45.792
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THEY'RE MISSING.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.166
THEY FELT TERRIBLE,

23:47.166 --> 23:49.208
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY ADVIL IN THE HOUSE,

23:49.208 --> 23:50.667
SO I TOOK HARRISON
TO THE STORE.

23:50.667 --> 23:52.250
- YOU LEFT THEM ALONE?
- I WAS TRYING TO BE NICE.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.000
AND WHEN I GOT BACK,
THEY WERE GONE.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.667
- MAYBE THEY WENT FOR A WALK.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

23:56.667 --> 23:57.834
THE BACK DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN,

23:57.834 --> 24:00.041
AND THEIR CELL PHONES
ARE STILL HERE.

24:00.041 --> 24:01.583
DEXTER, WHAT 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL

24:01.583 --> 24:03.250
WILLINGLY LEAVES
HER CELL PHONE BEHIND?

24:03.250 --> 24:05.291
- DON'T MOVE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

24:05.291 --> 24:07.250
- I'M SO SORRY.
[beep]

24:20.125 --> 24:21.792
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:21.792 --> 24:24.208
- I WENT TO THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE
TO SEE IF HE SAW ANYTHING.

24:24.208 --> 24:25.750
- WHAT?
- HEY.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.750
SO I SAW SOME GUY
NEAR THE HOUSE.

24:27.750 --> 24:30.291
LIGHT HAIR, AVERAGE BUILD,
MID-30s.

24:30.291 --> 24:33.333
- LIKE COLE AND BOYD
AND DAN.

24:33.333 --> 24:34.625
- OH, HE HAD A WHITE PANEL VAN.

24:34.625 --> 24:36.333
AND IT WAS WEIRD ENOUGH
I CHECKED OUT THE PLATE.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.709
N4B SOMETHING.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.208
- WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP HIM?

24:39.208 --> 24:40.667
- I DIDN'T KNOW
THE GIRLS WERE IN THE HOUSE.

24:40.667 --> 24:42.583
I MEAN, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU HAD A TENANT.

24:42.583 --> 24:44.583
JUST THOUGHT HE WAS A--
A PAINTER OR SOMETHING.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.625
- WHICH IS WHY YOU THOUGHT
TO CHECK THE LICENSE PLATE?

24:46.625 --> 24:48.709
- WELL, NO, THAT'S JUST HABIT
FROM NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

24:48.709 --> 24:50.083
- THANKS.
- YEAH.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.083
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:54.083 --> 24:57.333
- LOOKING FOR SIGNS
OF A BREAK-IN.

24:57.333 --> 24:59.417
AN ABDUCTION--THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE THINKING HERE, RIGHT?

24:59.417 --> 25:01.000
- YEAH. BUT IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.333
- IT DOES IF SOMEONE
CAME LOOKING FOR US.

25:03.333 --> 25:05.208
- LIKE ONE OF JORDAN'S GUYS.

25:05.208 --> 25:06.834
- THERE'S A REASON
YOU WERE WORRIED LAST NIGHT

25:06.834 --> 25:08.333
WHEN YOU HEARD NOISES
IN THE HOUSE.

25:08.333 --> 25:10.375
- BUT I OVERREACTED.
IT WAS NOTHING.

25:10.375 --> 25:11.709
- ONLY THIS TIME
THERE WAS SOMEONE

25:11.709 --> 25:13.709
LURKING AROUND THE HOUSE.

25:15.166 --> 25:16.542
I SHOULDN'T HAVE STOLEN
THAT BLOOD SAMPLE.

25:16.542 --> 25:18.291
NOT WITH THE GIRLS HERE.

25:21.291 --> 25:22.875
WE NEED TO CALL THE COPS.

25:24.834 --> 25:27.000
- THEY'LL JUST START
ASKING QUESTIONS.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.542
AND IF IT DOES HAVE TO DO
WITH JORDAN,

25:28.542 --> 25:30.875
THEY'LL PROBABLY TRACE IT
ALL BACK TO US.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.417
[speed dial beeping]

25:34.417 --> 25:36.375
[line rings]
- METRO.

25:36.375 --> 25:38.500
- THIS IS DEXTER MORGAN
FROM HOMICIDE.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.500
I'D LIKE TO REPORT
A PROBABLE CHILD ABDUCTION.

25:41.500 --> 25:44.750
IT'S A WHITE PANEL VAN.
I HAVE A PARTIAL PLATE.

25:47.959 --> 25:49.709
- WE'VE ISSUED A BLANKET
APB ON THE VAN.

25:49.709 --> 25:52.709
NCIC HAS STARTED A FILE
ON THE GIRLS.

25:52.709 --> 25:54.417
- UNTIL WE GET THEM BACK
SAFELY,

25:54.417 --> 25:57.458
DETECTIVE LINKER WILL BE
OUR LIAISON TO MISSING PERSONS.

25:57.458 --> 25:58.959
- DID YOU CALL OLIVIA'S
PARENTS?

25:58.959 --> 26:00.375
- I TRIED.
I COULDN'T GET A HOLD OF THEM.

26:00.375 --> 26:02.458
- WHAT ABOUT ASTOR'S
GRANDPARENTS?

26:02.458 --> 26:03.709
- THEY HADN'T HEARD FROM HER.

26:03.709 --> 26:05.583
I DIDN'T TELL THEM
SHE WAS MISSING, THOUGH.

26:05.583 --> 26:06.917
DIDN'T WANT TO WORRY THEM.

26:06.917 --> 26:08.917
YET.
- MOST MISSING CHILDREN

26:08.917 --> 26:11.125
ARE ABDUCTED BY SOMEONE
THE PARENTS KNOW.

26:11.125 --> 26:13.083
IS THERE ANYONE
YOU CAN THINK OF?

26:13.083 --> 26:14.375
- NO. NOBODY.

26:14.375 --> 26:17.709
- YOU SURE?
NO ONE NEW?

26:17.709 --> 26:20.375
- WHERE WERE YOU, ANYWAY,
WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN?

26:20.375 --> 26:22.000
- I CAN'T LIE ABOUT THIS.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.375
NOT WITH ASTOR'S LIFE
ON THE LINE.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.917
I WAS WITH JORDAN CHASE.

26:30.417 --> 26:32.917
HE...OFFERED ME SOME

26:32.917 --> 26:35.500
PRIVATE SESSIONS
TO HELP DEAL WITH...

26:35.500 --> 26:37.709
RITA'S DEATH.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.291
WHAT?

26:42.875 --> 26:45.583
- A LOT OF FUCKED UP PEOPLE
CIRCLING THAT GUY, DEX.

26:45.583 --> 26:48.250
- A LOT? WHO?

26:48.250 --> 26:49.458
BESIDES BOYD FOWLER.

26:49.458 --> 26:51.417
- WELL, HIS HEAD OF SECURITY
FOR ONE.

26:51.417 --> 26:53.792
- I THOUGHT WE CLEARED HIM.

26:53.792 --> 26:55.375
- MAY HAVE BEEN PREMATURE.

26:55.375 --> 26:57.125
- OKAY...WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:57.125 --> 27:00.250
- THE BARREL GIRLS CASE MIGHT
NOT BE AS CLOSED AS WE THOUGHT.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.542
- CAN WE JUST FIND THE VAN?

27:04.333 --> 27:06.792
- [ahem]

27:15.375 --> 27:17.291
[police radio chatter]

27:23.208 --> 27:27.500
[alarm whoops]

27:27.500 --> 27:29.125
- DON'T MOVE!
- SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!

27:29.125 --> 27:30.792
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
WHAT--WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:30.792 --> 27:33.125
- ON YOUR KNEES!
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD NOW!

27:33.125 --> 27:34.959
YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

27:34.959 --> 27:36.417
- WHO IS HE?

27:36.417 --> 27:38.000
- NAME'S BARRY KURT.
NO PRIORS.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.625
THEY FOUND HIM AT
A GAS STATION ON CORAL.

27:44.250 --> 27:45.667
- WHERE'S ASTOR?
- HEY--EASY!

27:45.667 --> 27:47.333
- IF YOU HURT HER,
I'LL KILL YOU.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.750
I'LL KILL YOU.
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.333
- YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
- HE'S LOOKING FOR THE GIRLS

27:51.333 --> 27:53.041
JUST LIKE YOU.
- HE'S WHAT?

27:53.041 --> 27:55.000
- I'M OLIVIA'S FATHER.
SORT OF, ANYWAY.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.834
I LIVE WITH HER MOM.

27:56.834 --> 27:58.667
- [exhales]

27:58.667 --> 28:01.000
M ASTOR'S STEPFATHER,
DEXTER MORGAN.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.667
- YEAH. YOU SHOULD
TRY TO CALM DOWN.

28:02.667 --> 28:04.709
- HE THOUGHT SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO HIS DAUGHTER.

28:04.709 --> 28:07.417
- SOMETHING IS GONNA HAPPEN
TO THEM WHEN I FIND THEM.

28:07.417 --> 28:09.792
OLIVIA BROKE INTO
OUR LIQUOR CABINET,

28:09.792 --> 28:11.625
STOLE MONEY FROM HER MOTHER,
AND TOOK OFF.

28:11.625 --> 28:13.750
WE'VE GOT GPS TRACKING
ON HER MOBILE PHONE.

28:13.750 --> 28:16.166
I FOLLOWED IT TO YOUR HOUSE,
BUT THEY WEREN'T THERE.

28:16.166 --> 28:18.417
I FIGURED I'D GAS UP THE VAN
AND GO BACK.

28:18.417 --> 28:20.875
NEXT THING I KNOW,
I'M ON MY KNEES IN CUFFS

28:20.875 --> 28:23.625
LIKE SOME LOSER ON COPS.

28:23.625 --> 28:25.333
- SO WHERE ARE THEY?

28:25.333 --> 28:26.959
- PROBABLY CAUSING TROUBLE
SOMEWHERE.

28:26.959 --> 28:28.500
EVER SINCE ASTOR
MOVED DOWN THE BLOCK,

28:28.500 --> 28:32.041
OLIVIA'S BEEN NOTHING
BUT A PAIN IN THE ASS.

28:32.041 --> 28:33.917
[cell phone rings]

28:33.917 --> 28:35.125
- MORGAN.

28:35.125 --> 28:37.417
- IS HE ALWAYS THIS VIOLENT?

28:38.875 --> 28:40.709
- THEY FOUND THE GIRLS
AT BAYSIDE.

28:40.709 --> 28:42.333
THEY'RE HOLDING THEM
FOR SHOPLIFTING.

28:54.750 --> 28:56.166
ASTOR?

28:57.875 --> 28:59.041
- THANK GOD.

28:59.041 --> 29:01.166
WE HAD THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT
LOOKING FOR YOU.

29:01.166 --> 29:02.375
WE WERE SO WORRIED.

29:02.375 --> 29:03.875
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU
PUT US THROUGH TODAY.

29:03.875 --> 29:06.875
- I'M SORRY.
- WHAT WERE YOU EVEN THINKING

29:06.875 --> 29:09.166
RUNNING OFF LIKE THAT?
- SHOPLIFTING?

29:09.166 --> 29:10.625
THAT FIGURES.

29:10.625 --> 29:11.875
- WE DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING.
I SWEAR.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.583
- I JUST TRIED ON A RING
AND FORGOT ABOUT IT.

29:13.583 --> 29:16.667
IT WAS A MISTAKE.
I GAVE IT BACK.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.625
- I'M DETECTIVE
DEBRA MORGAN

29:18.625 --> 29:19.583
FROM MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.959
MIND IF I TAKE IT
FROM HERE?

29:21.959 --> 29:24.959
- JUST MAKE SURE I DON'T
SEE THESE TWO AGAIN.

29:29.792 --> 29:31.375
- COME ON, WE'RE GOING HOME.
- NO!

29:31.375 --> 29:32.959
- NOW.
- MY STUFF'S AT ASTOR'S.

29:32.959 --> 29:35.125
I NEED TO GO WITH HER.
- YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME.

29:35.125 --> 29:37.333
- I DON'T WANT TO.
- TELL YOU WHAT.

29:37.333 --> 29:38.583
THEIR STUFF IS AT MY HOUSE.

29:38.583 --> 29:40.291
WHY DON'T I TAKE THEM THERE,
GET THEM PACKED.

29:40.291 --> 29:41.792
WE'LL MEET YOU IN AN HOUR.

29:41.792 --> 29:44.417
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO GET YOUR
VAN OUT OF IMPOUND ANYWAY.

29:44.417 --> 29:46.583
- WHICH YOU'RE PAYING FOR,
BY THE WAY.

29:46.583 --> 29:47.917
- WE'LL MEET YOU
AT THE ROADSIDE CAFE.

29:47.917 --> 29:51.083
IT'S RIGHT NEAR IMPOUND.
- GREAT.

29:52.417 --> 29:55.333
TEENAGERS.
THEY CAN MAKE YOU HOMICIDAL.

29:55.333 --> 29:57.417
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.875
- YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?
- YEAH.

30:06.875 --> 30:08.542
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU

30:08.542 --> 30:11.041
AND DETECTIVE MORGAN?

30:11.041 --> 30:13.583
- NOTHING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:13.583 --> 30:16.959
- OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THE BARREL GIRLS CASE.

30:16.959 --> 30:19.250
- WE FOUND SOME NEW EVIDENCE.

30:19.250 --> 30:21.583
- YOU AND DETECTIVE MORGAN.

30:21.583 --> 30:23.542
- SHE DID.
IN THE FILE ROOM.

30:23.542 --> 30:27.291
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU.

30:27.291 --> 30:28.792
WHAT?

30:28.792 --> 30:30.125
- YOU REALLY DON'T SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:30.125 --> 30:34.625
I SEND HER TO THE FILE ROOM
WITH ONE ASSIGNMENT--FILE.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.875
AND THEN SHE MAGICALLY
FINDS EVIDENCE

30:36.875 --> 30:39.500
TO REOPEN A CASE
SHE KNOWS I PERSONALLY CLOSED.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.375
- MARIA...IT'S DNA.

30:42.375 --> 30:44.166
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE MADE IT UP.

30:44.166 --> 30:47.834
- SHE'S TRYING TO GET BACK
AT ME.

30:47.834 --> 30:50.792
WE PINNED THIS
ON BOYD FOWLER.

30:50.792 --> 30:53.125
I HAD FIVE DETECTIVES
TELL ME HE'S THE ONE.

30:53.125 --> 30:56.250
- AND NOW I AM TELLING YOU
THAT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED.

30:56.250 --> 30:59.834
YOU NEED TO REOPEN THE CASE.
- I DISAGREE.

30:59.834 --> 31:03.166
CHANGING FIVE NAMES
ON THE MURDER BOARD

31:03.166 --> 31:05.500
FROM BLACK TO RED ISN'T
GONNA HELP THIS DEPARTMENT.

31:05.500 --> 31:08.500
- THE DEPARTMENT?
OR YOU?

31:14.166 --> 31:15.709
- WHAT HAPPENED?

31:15.709 --> 31:18.625
- UH...THERE WERE AT BAYSIDE.

31:18.625 --> 31:21.041
- OH, THANK GOD.
- SHOPLIFTING.

31:22.709 --> 31:25.917
- YOU GONNA INTRODUCE US?

31:27.792 --> 31:29.166
- THAT'S THE ONE I WAS
TELLING YOU ABOUT.

31:29.166 --> 31:31.959
HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND.

31:31.959 --> 31:33.250
- SHE'S MY TENANT.

31:33.250 --> 31:34.750
[sighs]

31:34.750 --> 31:37.208
LUMEN, THIS IS
MY SISTER DEBRA.

31:37.208 --> 31:39.000
DEB, LUMEN.

31:41.083 --> 31:42.750
- I DIDN'T KNOW
HE HAD A TENANT.

31:42.750 --> 31:44.917
- DIDN'T KNOW
HE HAD A SISTER.

31:50.625 --> 31:53.375
- I'M GONNA...

31:53.375 --> 31:55.500
GO CHECK ON THE GIRLS.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.709
- SERIOUSLY?

32:00.709 --> 32:02.125
THAT'S YOUR TENANT?

32:02.125 --> 32:04.583
- YES.
- OH.

32:04.583 --> 32:07.375
WHERE'S ALL HER STUFF?

32:07.375 --> 32:10.417
- SHE HASN'T REALLY
MOVED IN YET.

32:10.417 --> 32:13.542
- BUT YOU KNOW HER WELL ENOUGH
TO TRUST HER WITH YOUR SON.

32:13.542 --> 32:14.709
- IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.

32:14.709 --> 32:16.166
I THOUGHT THE GIRLS
HAD BEEN TAKEN.

32:16.166 --> 32:18.041
- WHY ARE YOU KEEPING HER
A SECRET?

32:18.041 --> 32:19.083
- I'M NOT.

32:19.083 --> 32:20.542
- REALLY?
'CAUSE AT THE STATION

32:20.542 --> 32:22.041
WE ASKED YOU WHO YOU WERE
SPENDING YOUR TIME WITH.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.709
YOU DIDN'T THINK TO MENTION
THE HOT BLONDE

32:23.709 --> 32:25.792
THAT'S LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE?

32:25.792 --> 32:27.583
- DIDN'T SEEM...
LIKE IT MATTERED.

32:27.583 --> 32:29.583
OBVIOUSLY,
SHE DIDN'T TAKE THE GIRLS.

32:29.583 --> 32:32.458
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

32:32.458 --> 32:34.083
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU.

32:34.083 --> 32:36.125
BELIEVE ME, I UNDERSTAND REBOUND
AS MUCH AS ANYBODY.

32:36.125 --> 32:38.291
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE SOON?

32:38.291 --> 32:39.667
- I'M NOT ON ANY REBOUND.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.667
- COME ON.
SHE'S YOUR TENANT?

32:41.667 --> 32:43.250
REALLY?

32:43.250 --> 32:46.000
- THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.792
- FINE.

32:47.792 --> 32:49.750
I GIVE UP.

32:49.750 --> 32:53.458
I GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE STATION.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.667
- DEB KNOWS ABOUT
MY PARTNER IN CRIME.

32:57.667 --> 33:00.625
THE WHOLE STATION KNOWS
I'M SEEING JORDAN CHASE.

33:00.625 --> 33:03.333
THIS IS NOT MY DAY.

33:03.333 --> 33:05.458
ASTOR!

33:05.458 --> 33:07.875
- JUST...STAY COOL.

33:07.875 --> 33:10.500
NO MATTER WHAT.

33:20.458 --> 33:23.417
- [sighs]

33:23.417 --> 33:25.917
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

33:25.917 --> 33:27.750
- NO.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.208
'CAUSE NOTHING
IS GOING ON WITH ME.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.500
- SOMETHING IS.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.500
YOU'RE DRINKING,

33:33.500 --> 33:35.000
SHOPLIFTING.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.166
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
WE DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING,

33:37.166 --> 33:38.625
AND IT WASN'T ME ANYWAY.

33:38.625 --> 33:39.750
- YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHY BARRY THINKS

33:39.750 --> 33:41.250
YOU'RE
THE BAD INFLUENCE HERE?

33:41.250 --> 33:42.417
- 'CAUSE HE'S AN ASSHOLE.

33:42.417 --> 33:43.542
- STOP.

33:45.542 --> 33:48.208
THIS IS NOT A GOOD PATH
YOU'RE HEADED DOWN HERE.

33:50.375 --> 33:54.750
LOOK, JUST TELL ME
WHAT'S WRONG, OKAY?

33:54.750 --> 33:56.542
I'M ACTUALLY
A GOOD LISTENER.

34:05.792 --> 34:08.041
- YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG?

34:08.041 --> 34:09.417
MY MOM GOT MURDERED,

34:09.417 --> 34:11.250
AND YOU MOVE HER
INTO OUR HOUSE

34:11.250 --> 34:12.417
AND TELL ME
SHE'S YOUR TENANT?

34:12.417 --> 34:13.709
- SHE IS.

34:13.709 --> 34:16.083
- SHE'S MORE.
I CAN FUCKING TELL.

34:16.083 --> 34:17.750
- ASTOR, YOU CANNOT
TALK TO ME THAT WAY.

34:17.750 --> 34:19.333
- OH.

34:19.333 --> 34:24.959
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE THIS GREAT LISTENER.

34:24.959 --> 34:27.542
I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

34:27.542 --> 34:31.041
- THEN WE'LL JUST SIT HERE
TILL YOU DO.

34:40.041 --> 34:41.834
- YOU READY TO GO HOME?

34:41.834 --> 34:43.959
- NOT REALLY.

34:43.959 --> 34:47.583
- YOU KNOW
I RAN AWAY ONCE, TOO.

34:47.583 --> 34:49.625
I DITCHED OUT
ON MY OWN WEDDING.

34:49.625 --> 34:51.208
- I DIDN'T RUN AWAY.

34:56.250 --> 34:58.291
- WHO DID THAT TO YOU?

35:00.917 --> 35:02.375
THE BRUISES
ON YOUR STOMACH.

35:02.375 --> 35:05.125
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

35:07.083 --> 35:11.041
- ACTUALLY,
I REALLY DO.

35:25.417 --> 35:27.333
I THINK
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

35:27.333 --> 35:28.667
- YEAH, I'M
IN A BATTLE OF WILLS

35:28.667 --> 35:30.959
WITH MY DRUNK, SHOPLIFTING
TEENAGE STEP-DAUGHTER,

35:30.959 --> 35:32.917
AND SHE'S GOING TO WIN.

35:32.917 --> 35:35.792
- OLIVIA HAS BRUISES
ALL OVER HER STOMACH AND BACK.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.875
SOMEONE'S
BEEN HURTING HER.

35:38.875 --> 35:41.041
- SHE TOLD YOU?

35:41.041 --> 35:42.542
- NO, I SAW.

35:42.542 --> 35:43.792
- WAIT,
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?

35:43.792 --> 35:45.959
- DON'T BE MAD.

35:45.959 --> 35:47.250
- I'M NOT MAD.

35:47.250 --> 35:51.125
I'M JUST, UM...

35:51.125 --> 35:52.583
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.250
- I'LL BE WITH OLIVIA.

35:57.792 --> 35:59.583
- PROMISE
YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING?

35:59.583 --> 36:01.500
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO HURT HER MORE.

36:01.500 --> 36:02.709
- WHO?

36:02.709 --> 36:04.333
- BARRY.
WHO DO YOU THINK?

36:04.333 --> 36:05.583
HE IS  AN ASSHOLE.

36:07.792 --> 36:09.250
- DOES HER MOM KNOW?

36:09.250 --> 36:11.750
HE ONLY HITS HER
IN PLACES THAT DON'T SHOW.

36:11.750 --> 36:14.000
HE GETS
ALL CRAZY OVER NOTHING.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.333
HE DOESN'T LIKE HER HAIR,
SHE'S TWO MINUTES LATE.

36:18.458 --> 36:20.000
I THOUGHT
SHE'D BE SAFE HERE,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.583
BUT THEN THERE'S LUMEN,

36:22.583 --> 36:26.333
AND BARRY SHOWED UP,
AND WE JUST...RAN.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.041
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

36:28.041 --> 36:30.000
- 'CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D CARE.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.750
- OF COURSE I CARE.

36:34.750 --> 36:36.667
- EVEN WHEN
WE ALL LIVED HERE,

36:36.667 --> 36:39.333
YOU WERE SO BUSY
OUT DOING STUFF ALL THE TIME.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.875
OLIVIA'S MY FRIEND.

36:46.875 --> 36:50.125
MY ONLY FRIEND
SINCE MOM DIED.

36:50.125 --> 36:53.667
I WANTED TO HELP HER, AND...

36:53.667 --> 36:55.500
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

36:55.500 --> 36:58.583
- YOU DID KNOW WHAT TO DO.
YOU CAME HOME.

37:04.083 --> 37:05.917
I'M GONNA
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

37:05.917 --> 37:07.208
OKAY?

37:17.417 --> 37:19.166
- EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH ASTOR?

37:19.166 --> 37:20.542
- NOTHING TURNING 20
WON'T FIX.

37:20.542 --> 37:21.542
WHAT'D LAGUERTA SAY?

37:21.542 --> 37:24.041
- SHE'S NOT GONNA
REOPEN THE CASE.

37:24.041 --> 37:25.375
SHE THINKS THAT YOU HAVE

37:25.375 --> 37:27.500
SOME KIND
OF VENDETTA AGAINST HER.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.959
- THAT'S FUCKING RIDICULOUS.

37:28.959 --> 37:30.333
- GIVE HER A DAY
TO COOL OFF.

37:30.333 --> 37:31.667
WE'LL TRY AGAIN
TOMORROW.

37:38.417 --> 37:40.000
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA
REOPEN THE CASE?

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

37:41.000 --> 37:42.542
- COME RIGHT IN,
DETECTIVE.

37:42.542 --> 37:46.083
- THERE ARE AT LEAST
FIVE DEAD GIRLS IN BARRELS.

37:46.083 --> 37:48.417
AND NOW THERE'S
DNA EVIDENCE

37:48.417 --> 37:50.542
SAYING THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE

37:50.542 --> 37:52.291
ARE STILL OUT THERE.

37:52.291 --> 37:54.000
AND YOU THINK
THAT'S ABOUT ME

37:54.000 --> 37:57.083
TRYING TO GET BACK AT YOU?

37:57.083 --> 38:00.375
DID YOU EVEN READ
THE FILE?

38:00.375 --> 38:01.750
THERE'S FUCKING PROOF.

38:01.750 --> 38:02.959
- JUST WATCH YOUR TONE.

38:05.792 --> 38:08.917
- YOU KNOW...

38:08.917 --> 38:11.333
YOU THROWING ME UNDER THE BUS
FOR THE FUENTES BROTHERS,

38:11.333 --> 38:14.667
USING YOUR HUSBAND
AS A CHESS PIECE,

38:14.667 --> 38:16.291
PUTTING QUINN
ON BOGUS VACATION DAYS

38:16.291 --> 38:18.250
SO THAT I DON'T HAVE
A FUCKING PARTNER?

38:18.250 --> 38:19.625
IF THAT'S ALL
JUST SOME GAME TO YOU,

38:19.625 --> 38:21.166
I'LL TRY
TO UNDERSTAND IT,

38:21.166 --> 38:24.542
BUT THOSE GIRLS ARE DEAD.

38:24.542 --> 38:26.792
DON'T YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN?

38:29.250 --> 38:31.792
I MEAN, WHAT THE FUCK
ARE WE DOING HERE?

38:31.792 --> 38:32.834
- ENOUGH!

38:34.083 --> 38:36.000
OKAY.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.500
- OKAY WHAT?

38:39.125 --> 38:41.083
- I'M REOPENING THE CASE.

38:41.083 --> 38:43.083
BUT YOU NEED
TO HEAR ME,

38:43.083 --> 38:45.959
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

38:45.959 --> 38:51.250
I MADE THE FUENTES SITUATION
GO AWAY.

38:51.250 --> 38:52.125
I WAS TRYING
TO HELP BATISTA.

38:52.125 --> 38:54.083
AS FAR AS QUINN GOES,

38:54.083 --> 38:56.083
HE WASN'T ON VACATION.

38:56.083 --> 38:59.166
I SUSPENDED HIM.

38:59.166 --> 39:01.500
TO PROTECT YOUR BROTHER.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.792
- PROTECT HIM FROM WHAT?

39:13.125 --> 39:15.333
- YOU'RE SO INTERESTED
IN THE TRUTH,

39:15.333 --> 39:16.625
ASK QUINN.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.458
- HEY.

39:28.458 --> 39:29.542
- CAN I TALK TO YOU?

39:29.542 --> 39:32.166
IN PRIVATE?

39:34.667 --> 39:37.333
- LOOK, IF THIS
IS ABOUT THIS MORNING...

39:37.333 --> 39:39.166
- LAST MONTH,
WHEN YOU TOLD ME

39:39.166 --> 39:41.000
THAT YOU WERE TAKING
SOME VACATION DAYS,

39:41.000 --> 39:45.333
WERE YOU ACTUALLY
ON SUSPENSION?

39:45.333 --> 39:46.792
- WHY?

39:46.792 --> 39:47.792
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

39:47.792 --> 39:48.709
- WERE YOU?

39:48.709 --> 39:51.291
- DID LAGUERTA
SAY SOMETHING?

39:51.291 --> 39:53.417
- SHE TOLD ME
I SHOULD TALK TO YOU.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.333
DID IT HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH MY BROTHER?

39:59.750 --> 40:01.000
- YEAH.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.083
BUT IT WAS NOTHING.

40:03.083 --> 40:04.417
- THEN WHY DID YOU LIE?

40:08.041 --> 40:10.625
- I WAS INVESTIGATING
RITA'S MURDER,

40:10.625 --> 40:13.125
TRYING TO HELP.

40:13.125 --> 40:15.667
I HAD A LEAD
ON KYLE BUTLER.

40:15.667 --> 40:19.709
I FIGURED IF WE COULD FIND
THE PERSON WHO KNEW TRINITY,

40:19.709 --> 40:22.417
THEN MAYBE WE COULD
TRACK DOWN THE CREEP

40:22.417 --> 40:25.500
WHO KILLED
YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.125
LAGUERTA TOLD ME
TO BACK OFF,

40:27.125 --> 40:28.291
LEAVE IT TO THE FBI.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.583
WHEN I DIDN'T,
SHE SUSPENDED ME.

40:33.583 --> 40:34.875
- WHAT WAS THE LEAD?

40:34.875 --> 40:37.917
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT DIDN'T PAN OUT.

40:37.917 --> 40:42.542
- LAGUERTA TOLD ME THAT SHE
WAS PROTECTING DEXTER FROM YOU.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.583
WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT?

40:49.083 --> 40:53.500
- YOU REMEMBER THOSE COMPOSITE
SKETCHES OF KYLE BUTLER?

40:53.500 --> 40:56.417
I GOT THIS CRAZY IDEA

40:56.417 --> 41:00.000
THAT MAYBE
IT WAS YOUR BROTHER.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.583
- [exhales]

41:02.583 --> 41:06.166
- NOTHING CAME OF IT,
SO I DROPPED IT.

41:06.166 --> 41:09.333
I'M AN IDIOT, OKAY?

41:11.667 --> 41:13.291
- YEAH, YOU ARE.

41:13.291 --> 41:15.417
[cell phone rings]
- DEB, I--

41:17.667 --> 41:18.750
[rings]

41:21.792 --> 41:23.083
[rings]

41:23.083 --> 41:24.750
[sighs]
[phone beeps]

41:27.125 --> 41:28.875
SHIT.

41:28.875 --> 41:31.834
[pop version of Mack the Knife
sung in Spanish]

41:31.834 --> 41:39.917
â™ª â™ª

41:45.667 --> 41:47.083
- WHAT'S THIS?

41:47.083 --> 41:48.583
WHERE'S OLIVIA?

41:48.583 --> 41:50.500
- I JUST WANTED TO...

41:50.500 --> 41:52.959
SPEAK TO YOU FIRST,
PARENT TO PARENT.

41:52.959 --> 41:56.000
- OH.
YOU TALK TO ASTOR?

41:56.000 --> 41:58.750
- YEAH, I DID.

41:58.750 --> 41:59.834
[sighs]

41:59.834 --> 42:02.542
HONESTLY, I'M NOT SURE
WHAT I SHOULD DO.

42:02.542 --> 42:04.250
- I FEEL FOR YOU, MAN.

42:04.250 --> 42:07.166
IT'S TOUGH LOOKING AFTER
SOMEBODY ELSE'S KIDS.

42:07.166 --> 42:11.166
SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOTTA
SHOW 'EM WHO'S BOSS.

42:11.166 --> 42:13.000
- IS THAT WHAT YOU DO
WITH OLIVIA,

42:13.000 --> 42:16.166
SHOW HER WHO'S BOSS?

42:16.166 --> 42:17.291
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

42:17.291 --> 42:21.333
- I KNOW
ABOUT OLIVIA'S BRUISES,

42:21.333 --> 42:23.375
HOW THEY'RE
STRATEGICALLY PLACED

42:23.375 --> 42:25.166
SO THEY WON'T SHOW.

42:27.458 --> 42:28.875
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

42:30.834 --> 42:33.083
- NO?

42:33.083 --> 42:35.083
LET ME SHOW YOU?

42:35.083 --> 42:37.041
- [groaning]

42:37.041 --> 42:38.291
[coughing]

42:38.291 --> 42:39.959
- THAT'S YOUR SOLAR PLEXUS.

42:39.959 --> 42:41.166
- [coughing and gasping]

42:41.166 --> 42:43.709
- RIGHT NOW, YOUR DIAPHRAGM
IS PARTIALLY PARALYZED,

42:43.709 --> 42:46.083
WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE HAVING
TROUBLE CATCHING YOUR BREATH.

42:46.083 --> 42:48.542
- WHAT ARE YOU, MAN,
SOME KIND OF PSYCHO?

42:48.542 --> 42:50.750
- NOT TODAY.
JUST A CONCERNED PARENT.

42:50.750 --> 42:51.750
- AAH!

42:51.750 --> 42:53.041
OHH!

42:53.041 --> 42:54.709
- THAT'S YOUR LIVER.

42:54.709 --> 42:56.041
- [groaning]

42:56.041 --> 42:57.750
- THE NICE THING
ABOUT THE LIVER IS

42:57.750 --> 43:00.375
IF YOU HIT IT JUST RIGHT,
YOU GET THE VAGUS NERVE,

43:00.375 --> 43:01.959
WHICH TENTACLES OUT
TO THE REST OF YOUR BODY.

43:01.959 --> 43:03.542
- [groaning]

43:03.542 --> 43:07.166
- YOUR BRAIN SHORT-CIRCUITS,
YOUR BODY SHUTS DOWN,

43:07.166 --> 43:10.583
AND YOU FEEL,
WHAT'S THE WORD, TERROR?

43:10.583 --> 43:13.417
WHICH IS WHAT OLIVIA FELT
EVERY TIME YOU HIT HER THERE

43:13.417 --> 43:15.417
JUST SO THE BRUISES
WOULDN'T SHOW.

43:15.417 --> 43:16.583
- [groans]

43:16.583 --> 43:18.875
- I WANT YOU TO LISTEN
TO ME CAREFULLY.

43:18.875 --> 43:21.291
LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY, BECAUSE
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.

43:21.291 --> 43:23.250
YOU'RE GONNA CALL
OLIVIA'S MOTHER.

43:23.250 --> 43:25.792
YOU'RE GONNA TELL HER
YOU'RE SICK OF HER FAT ASS.

43:25.792 --> 43:28.417
YOU CAN'T STAND
TO LOOK AT IT ANYMORE.

43:28.417 --> 43:30.583
AND YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE HER BELIEVE IT,

43:30.583 --> 43:32.875
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
SHE MAY TAKE YOU BACK ONE DAY

43:32.875 --> 43:35.125
AND LET YOU NEAR HER KID
OR MINE.

43:35.125 --> 43:36.583
AND I CAN'T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

43:36.583 --> 43:39.834
- [coughing]

43:39.834 --> 43:41.834
- YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA SWING BY
TO PICK UP YOUR STUFF.

43:41.834 --> 43:43.041
YOU'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE.

43:43.041 --> 43:46.250
TOMORROW, WHEN I DROP
OLIVIA OFF,

43:46.250 --> 43:50.959
YOU WILL BE GONE.

43:50.959 --> 43:53.709
IF YOU EVER COME BACK,

43:53.709 --> 43:57.375
BELIEVE ME, I WON'T
GO SO EASY NEXT TIME.

43:57.375 --> 43:59.625
- [coughing]

43:59.625 --> 44:02.333
- BY THE WAY,
THAT'S YOUR KIDNEY.

44:02.333 --> 44:03.625
- [groans]

44:08.458 --> 44:10.041
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

44:10.041 --> 44:11.375
- I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT, OKAY?

44:11.375 --> 44:13.208
"THIS ISN'T YOUR BUSINESS,
DEXTER.

44:13.208 --> 44:14.750
"DON'T GET INVOLVED, DEXTER.

44:14.750 --> 44:16.625
YOU PUT TOO MUCH
AT RISK, DEXTER."

44:16.625 --> 44:18.583
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

44:21.792 --> 44:22.959
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

44:25.291 --> 44:27.917
- YOU ARE?

- YOU PROTECTED ASTOR,

44:30.166 --> 44:32.667
PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE
FOR ANOTHER PERSON.

44:32.667 --> 44:36.625
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU HAD THAT IN YOU.

44:38.667 --> 44:40.083
I UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

44:40.083 --> 44:41.875
ASSUMED YOU WERE
A MONSTER

44:41.875 --> 44:44.458
WHEN YOU WERE CAPABLE

44:44.458 --> 44:46.875
OF SO MUCH MORE.

44:49.041 --> 44:50.500
IF ONLY I'D SEEN THAT,

44:50.500 --> 44:52.458
MAYBE I WOULDN'T HAVE
LED YOU DOWN THIS PATH.

45:07.500 --> 45:08.583
- DEB?

45:08.583 --> 45:10.291
- HI, HONEY.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.041
- GET THE FUCK
OUT OF MY APARTMENT.

45:20.041 --> 45:21.166
- I BROUGHT YOU
A PRESENT.

45:21.166 --> 45:23.041
DON'T YOU
WANT TO SEE WHAT IT IS?

45:23.041 --> 45:24.875

45:24.875 --> 45:27.917

AT 3:00 A.M. IN THE MORNING,

45:27.917 --> 45:29.917
AND THEY ARE NOT FUCKING.

45:29.917 --> 45:31.291
- WHAT'S IN THE BAGS?

45:31.291 --> 45:32.542
- SOMETHING HEAVY.

45:32.542 --> 45:33.834
I'M THINKING NARCOTICS,
MAYBE A BODY.

45:36.667 --> 45:37.750
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

45:37.750 --> 45:39.875
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S
BESIDE THE POINT.

45:39.875 --> 45:42.041
POINT IS THAT
WHEN THEY CAME BACK,

45:42.041 --> 45:43.458
THOSE BAGS WERE GONE,

45:43.458 --> 45:45.667
SO WHATEVER THEY'RE HIDING,
IT'S SOMETHING BIG.

45:45.667 --> 45:48.333
- THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

45:49.709 --> 45:53.083
HERE. CONSIDER THIS
YOUR SEVERANCE PACKAGE.

45:53.083 --> 45:54.792
WE'RE DONE.

45:55.875 --> 45:57.750

45:57.750 --> 46:00.709

46:02.083 --> 46:04.583

46:04.583 --> 46:07.792
- AND I'M SAYIN' BULLSHIT.

46:07.792 --> 46:09.959
IF THIS THING IS AS BIG
AS I THINK IT IS,

46:09.959 --> 46:12.500
LAGUERTA AND ALL THEM
OTHER DOUCHEBAGS IN HOMICIDE

46:12.500 --> 46:13.917

KISSING MY ASS.

46:13.917 --> 46:15.125
- BACK OFF, LIDDY.

46:15.125 --> 46:16.583
I MEAN IT.

46:16.583 --> 46:19.792

46:21.542 --> 46:26.041

46:33.917 --> 46:36.583
AND STAY THE FUCK

46:40.834 --> 46:42.667
- [chuckles]

47:11.625 --> 47:14.625
- SO YOU REALLY DID
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

47:14.625 --> 47:16.417
- I READ THE REPORT.

47:18.208 --> 47:19.625
- THANK YOU.

47:19.625 --> 47:21.041
- DOES THIS MEAN...

47:23.333 --> 47:25.458
YOU'LL STOP SLEEPING
ON THE COUCH?

47:27.625 --> 47:30.458
- WE STILL GOT
A LONG WAY TO GO

47:30.458 --> 47:32.959
BETWEEN THE COUCH
AND THE BEDROOM, MARIA.

47:40.959 --> 47:42.875
- SO, WHAT, NOW YOU'RE
NOT EVEN TALKING TO ME?

47:46.458 --> 47:49.417
DEB, LOOK,
I HAD AN IDIOT THEORY

47:49.417 --> 47:51.750
AND I DROPPED IT.

47:51.750 --> 47:53.792
- YEAH, BECAUSE
LAGUERTA SUSPENDED YOU.

47:53.792 --> 47:56.875
- NO, BECAUSE I WAS WRONG.

47:56.875 --> 47:59.291
LOOK, WHAT I SAID
YESTERDAY IS TRUE.

47:59.291 --> 48:00.583
I LOVE YOU,

48:00.583 --> 48:02.208
AND I'M NOT TAKING
IT BACK.

48:04.750 --> 48:06.208
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

48:06.208 --> 48:08.458
- IT MEANS I'D NEVER DO
ANYTHING TO HURT YOU.

48:08.458 --> 48:10.667
EVER.

48:10.667 --> 48:13.000
- I TRUSTED YOU.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.458
AND WHILE YOU WERE
FUCKING ME,

48:14.458 --> 48:16.667
YOU WERE SPREADING SHIT
ABOUT MY BROTHER BEHIND MY BACK.

48:16.667 --> 48:19.208
YOU THINK
THAT'S NOT HURTING ME?

48:19.208 --> 48:20.750
FUCK YOU.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.208
- YOU WANT US
TO COME INSIDE WITH YOU?

48:43.208 --> 48:45.125
- NO, I'LL BE OKAY.

48:45.125 --> 48:46.750
I COULD BARELY UNDERSTAND
MY MOM ON THE PHONE

48:46.750 --> 48:48.333
WITH ALL THE CRYING,

48:48.333 --> 48:51.458
BUT SHE ACTUALLY SAID
BARRY DID HER A FAVOR LEAVING.

48:51.458 --> 48:53.000
HE DEFINITELY
DID ME A FAVOR.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.750
HE TOLD HER
SHE HAS A FAT ASS.

48:54.750 --> 48:55.792
[laughs]

48:55.792 --> 48:57.250
HE IS NOT COMING BACK.

49:05.417 --> 49:06.542
THANK YOU.

49:06.542 --> 49:08.792
CALL YOU LATER.

49:18.417 --> 49:19.917
[engine starts]

49:48.625 --> 49:50.375

50:25.083 --> 50:26.959

YOUR TENANT, THOUGH.

50:26.959 --> 50:29.458

50:29.458 --> 50:34.291
WHO'S BEEN
THROUGH SOME REALLY...

50:34.291 --> 50:35.583
REALLY BAD STUFF.

50:35.583 --> 50:38.917
I'M HELPING HER
DEAL WITH IT.

50:38.917 --> 50:42.000
- DOES IT MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER?

50:42.000 --> 50:43.667
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

50:43.667 --> 50:45.375
- ABOUT MOM.

50:45.375 --> 50:46.917
BEING THERE FOR LUMEN,

50:46.917 --> 50:50.083
DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MOM?

51:00.875 --> 51:02.500
- I LOVE YOU.

51:04.750 --> 51:06.417

51:09.542 --> 51:10.834
- YOU SHOULD COME IN,

51:10.834 --> 51:13.667

51:13.667 --> 51:15.458

51:15.458 --> 51:16.834
ABOUT MIAMI.

51:29.208 --> 51:30.250

51:31.500 --> 51:33.375
- THIS IS MAMA?

51:34.458 --> 51:36.125
- MAMA.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.250
- OKAY, BUD.

51:43.917 --> 51:45.750
JORDAN CHASE TOLD ME
TO FIGURE OUT

51:45.750 --> 51:48.583
WHAT I WANT MOST.

51:48.583 --> 51:50.750
THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE.

51:50.750 --> 51:54.834
TO BE A GOOD DAD.

51:54.834 --> 51:56.125
BUT NOW THAT ASTOR'S SAFE,

51:56.125 --> 51:58.959
