00:02.085 --> 00:03.758
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:03.921 --> 00:05.514
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.672 --> 00:08.972
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.176 --> 00:11.270
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

00:11.428 --> 00:13.772
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

00:13.931 --> 00:15.854
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

00:16.015 --> 00:17.939
<i>I am something else.</i>

00:18.143 --> 00:20.441
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

00:21.271 --> 00:22.614
Previously, on Arrow...

00:22.773 --> 00:23.774
Follow me or die.

00:25.484 --> 00:27.907
Hello, Mr. Queen. My name is Talia.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.196
<i>I've been looking for you.</i>

00:29.446 --> 00:30.447
As soon as I'm out of here,

00:30.656 --> 00:32.750
Walker will concoct some reason
to put a bullet in my head.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.577
I think I'm gonna have
to prosecute this one myself.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.248
It could take a while.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.959
I haven't kept my promise to Laurel.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.543
You're gonna train a new Black Canary?

00:39.706 --> 00:42.630
I think that somewhere out there, there is
a woman worthy of Laurel's legacy.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.551
<i>Now all we've gotta do
is find her.</i>

00:49.216 --> 00:52.686
<i>Protests continue into the final
countdown for tonight's ignition</i>

00:52.844 --> 00:55.222
<i>of S.T.A.R. Labs'
controversial particle accelerator.</i>

00:55.389 --> 00:58.268
<i>S.T.A.R. Labs founder
and CEO, Harrison Wells,</i>

00:58.433 --> 01:02.108
<i>promises a new era of
scientific advancement is at hand.</i>

01:02.271 --> 01:06.196
Would you look at that?
Future's getting brighter every day.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.994
What do you think, babe?
You a fan of progress?

01:09.319 --> 01:11.868
Why don't you just put a bullet
in my head and be done with it?

01:13.740 --> 01:16.334
Or maybe you don't
have the sack to pull the trigger.

01:17.119 --> 01:19.542
I was gonna play another hand,
let you rest some.

01:19.705 --> 01:22.333
But lay down a challenge like that,
what's a guy gonna do?

01:23.208 --> 01:24.960
I'm gonna get what I need from you,

01:25.127 --> 01:27.175
or maybe one of those molars back there.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.338
Forget her.

01:28.964 --> 01:31.137
Hey, Tina. Not looking too good.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.519
But I got something here
that might put a smile on your face.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.555
Look what we got here.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.856
- Oh, my God. Vinny...
- I'm sorry, Tina.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.771
<i>Aw, so sweet.</i>

01:43.937 --> 01:45.939
I thought you two
were just cop buddies, but...

01:47.733 --> 01:51.237
You can tell me, Vin.
You're tapping that sweet ass, aren't you?

01:56.700 --> 01:58.668
I wasn't sure which one of you to kill.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.959
Thanks for making up my mind for me.
Get the tarp.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.874
No, please, please, please!
Don't hurt him.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.042
Shut up.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.185
<i>Wait, we are now being
told to evacuate the facility.</i>

02:15.344 --> 02:16.937
<i>The storm may have
caused a malfunction</i>

02:17.095 --> 02:18.392
<i>to the primary cooling system.</i>

02:18.889 --> 02:19.890
<i>Officials are down...</i>

02:22.934 --> 02:25.403
Sean, lam begging you.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.272
Please.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.891
- No.
- What do you mean, "No?"

02:59.054 --> 03:00.772
- Did you even read her resume?
- Yeah, I did.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.312
So, you know she flew
600 sorties over Iraq,

03:03.475 --> 03:04.943
launched a program for inner-city kids

03:05.102 --> 03:06.820
to get into flight school
as a way out of poverty,

03:06.978 --> 03:09.606
plus, she's got skills in krav maga
and a third-degree black belt.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.867
If Top Gun here is a maybe,

03:12.025 --> 03:13.447
how the hell did I even get on the team?

03:14.111 --> 03:15.112
Don't answer that.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.282
Look, finding a new Black Canary
isn't just about reviewing resumes,

03:18.448 --> 03:19.700
it's a feel thing.

03:19.866 --> 03:23.120
Well, I feel like we're busting
our asses to find you candidates,

03:23.286 --> 03:24.412
and you keep shooting 'em down.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.547
I promised Laurel that
I would carry on her legacy,

03:26.707 --> 03:28.801
I just don't won't Black Siren
to be all that's left of her.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.007
Well, what about this woman?
Allison Slater.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.213
Okay, she's a decorated CIA officer

03:33.422 --> 03:35.641
who also happens to be
a world-champion in judo.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.642
Nope. Okay.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.437
What about Tara Michele?

03:40.846 --> 03:43.816
Army special ops, but then
she decided to open a clinic downtown

03:44.057 --> 03:45.809
to offer free healthcare to the homeless.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.482
<i>Okay, well, I will keep digging.</i>

03:48.687 --> 03:50.985
Okay, hold up, what about this one?

03:52.399 --> 03:54.743
This woman got
her engineering PhD at age 20,

03:55.026 --> 03:56.369
won gold in karate at the Olympics,

03:56.570 --> 03:58.243
turned down offers
from the NSA and ARGUS

03:58.405 --> 03:59.907
to join NASA as an astronaut by day,

04:00.073 --> 04:03.327
while at night she secretly protects
the citizens of Houston as, get this,

04:04.286 --> 04:05.583
a ninja vigilante.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.044
Oh, and she works
soup kitchens on Saturdays

04:08.206 --> 04:09.833
and rescues puppies on Sundays.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.503
Astronaut-ninja? You're making that up.

04:12.669 --> 04:13.670
He did.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.010
Karate won't be an
Olympic sport until 2020.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.266
Fine, you got me.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.928
This is just some woman
who teaches preschool in the Glades,

04:21.094 --> 04:23.313
- but my point still stands.
- That point being?

04:23.472 --> 04:24.644
That no matter how amazing they are,

04:24.806 --> 04:25.978
no one's gonna be good enough for you.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.518
<i>Because you keep
comparing them to Laurel,</i>

04:27.684 --> 04:30.483
which is an impossible standard
you might wanna consider loosening.

04:30.645 --> 04:33.899
We just need to keep looking,
to think outside the box.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.692
How far outside the box
are we talking here?

04:35.859 --> 04:39.739
Are we talking way outside the box,
like, urban legends outside?

04:39.988 --> 04:42.741
Because if we are,
I think I might have something.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.410
Wait, what do you mean, "urban legend?"

04:44.576 --> 04:46.374
I mean her.

04:46.870 --> 04:47.871
By her, you mean who?

04:48.038 --> 04:50.757
Well, actually,
I have no idea what her name is,

04:50.916 --> 04:52.884
but according to the chat rooms I visited,

04:53.043 --> 04:55.137
she's a kickass woman
who appears out of nowhere

04:55.295 --> 04:57.047
<i>- and saves crime victims-
- In Star City?</i>

04:57.255 --> 04:58.723
All over America, actually.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.393
And get this, she even has a cry.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.724
Like, a canary cry.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.347
She's a meta,

05:05.555 --> 05:07.228
with the same power as Earth-2 Laurel?

05:07.390 --> 05:09.188
If that isn't <i>bashert,</i>
I don't know what is.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.605
- What?
- <i>Bashert</i> means fate. Destiny.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.443
<i>According to the ARGUS database
I just hacked,</i>

05:14.689 --> 05:16.487
sightings started
three years ago in Central City.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.323
That is right when S.T.A.R. Labs exploded.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.579
And she even has a black
leather jacket and everything.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.364
Only thing that's really
missing is the blonde hair,

05:22.531 --> 05:23.999
and you can fix that with a wig.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.165
I have to handle
something for John.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.083
Let's see if this urban legend
is the real deal,

05:29.246 --> 05:30.418
and call me when you have something.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.344
- Hey.-
- Hey.-

05:39.506 --> 05:41.634
Just got a text from Adrian,
do you know what it's about?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.973
Maybe to figure out how
Prometheus faked Lyla's voice

05:44.135 --> 05:45.603
to get me out of the bunker and into here.

05:45.762 --> 05:46.934
I'm less concerned
with how you got in here

05:47.097 --> 05:48.724
and more concerned
with getting you out again.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.609
Gentlemen, sorry I'm late.

05:53.562 --> 05:54.779
How you holding up?

05:55.105 --> 05:57.358
Walker's gonna have custody
of me in a week, so...

05:57.524 --> 06:00.824
As soon as Walker gets his hands on John
he's gonna throw him into a hole.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.028
Maybe not.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.285
I've got a buddy
at the National Security Agency.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.205
Turns out they have
General Walker under investigation

06:07.367 --> 06:08.835
and were putting together quite the case.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.793
Wire transfers and some
keyhole satellite images

06:11.955 --> 06:13.798
of his movements with the nuclear trigger.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.296
That's enough to exonerate John.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.717
Except I don't like
the way you just said,

06:16.918 --> 06:18.465
"were building a case" just now.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.471
Walker has friends in high places.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.473
Managed to get
the investigation slow-rolled.

06:22.632 --> 06:23.679
But the file still exists.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.390
I made a FOIA request,
but seeing as all this is classified,

06:26.636 --> 06:28.388
that could take months, maybe even years.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.312
- That's time we don't have.
- I'm sorry I don't have better news.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.944
No, Adrian, you have gone
above and beyond already.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.230
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.911
Well, Felicity is really going
to enjoy hacking the NSA.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.410
You mean after she's brought you
a hundred Black Canary candidates

06:50.577 --> 06:51.669
for you to say no to?

06:52.287 --> 06:54.005
You're not the only one
who visits, Oliver.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.208
John, I understand what I promised Laurel.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.962
Now that we're actively doing it,
trying to replace her?

07:00.795 --> 07:01.796
<i>N</i> just...

07:03.423 --> 07:04.470
It feels wrong.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.347
She didn't want you to
find someone to replace her,

07:07.510 --> 07:09.012
just someone to take on the mantle.

07:09.512 --> 07:13.233
And from where I'm sitting,
that's two very different things.

07:18.813 --> 07:19.985
Sleeping beauty awakes.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.660
- Where am I?
- Someplace safe.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.195
I have to get back to the Bratva.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.580
Why, so they can finish killing you?

07:28.198 --> 07:30.747
That was Gregor, I have allies there.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.541
I think you'll come to discover
circumstances within the Bratva

07:33.745 --> 07:35.497
a bit more complex than you thought.

07:36.706 --> 07:37.798
Why did you save me?

07:38.708 --> 07:41.678
Well, from what I could tell,
you needed rescuing.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.557
- Where'd you get that?
- Wasn't hard.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.224
Sneaking past a bunch of oafish Bratva
is hardly a test of my skills.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.017
Why did you do that?

07:56.559 --> 08:00.063
Shipwrecked on Lian Yu, fled to Hong Kong,

08:00.647 --> 08:03.901
the Omega Virus, Shadowspire,

08:04.067 --> 08:06.320
and now, you're mixed up with the Bratva.

08:06.861 --> 08:10.206
But along the way,
you went back home to Starling City,

08:10.740 --> 08:13.368
though you couldn't bear to
reveal yourself to your family.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.751
- How do you know this?
- I did my homework.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.252
What makes me so interesting?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.382
You wear the hood of one of my students.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.597
Yao Fei Gulong?

08:33.554 --> 08:35.273
You get my text about John?

08:35.432 --> 08:37.605
If there is any trace
of the file that Digg needs,

08:37.767 --> 08:39.610
it's gonna be buried
behind some serious firewalls.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.442
Actually, firewalls don't
even begin to explain it,

08:41.604 --> 08:44.778
it's gonna be more like
fire castles, or fire mountains.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.067
How did you know where to start?

08:46.234 --> 08:48.236
All that I told you was that
Chase might have something.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.871
Yeah, and then I hacked his laptop.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.991
Saving Digg is gonna break
at least 12 federal laws.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.252
Hacking your DA is just small ball.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.208
Plus, you are the mayor,
you can pardon me.

08:57.412 --> 08:58.459
Actually, I can't.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.339
It doesn't matter because I am having fun.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.751
I haven't done a good old
grab-government-secrets kind of hack

09:02.917 --> 09:03.918
in a really long time

09:04.085 --> 09:06.179
and it's a great change of pace
and it feels awesome.

09:06.337 --> 09:07.805
And it'll keep me busy while you're gone.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.809
- I'm going somewhere?
- Maybe Hub City.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.436
We're thinking that's where
the new Black Canary is hanging out.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.764
Yeah, let's not call her that just yet,

09:15.930 --> 09:17.477
I'd like to see her
in the field at least first.

09:17.682 --> 09:18.934
Ask and you shall receive.

09:19.142 --> 09:22.146
I was able to track down cell phone
footage of her latest act of heroism.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.028
Heroine-ism? Heroism. Anyway, take a look.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.321
The video isn't clear enough
for facial recog,

09:27.484 --> 09:28.827
<i>but she's real all right.</i>

09:28.985 --> 09:31.534
I've watched it, like, ten times.
The woman can fight.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.371
She can focus the sound
better than Black Siren,

09:35.533 --> 09:37.206
and she is more skilled at hand-to-hand.

09:38.328 --> 09:42.333
This is almost like...
What was that word that you used?

09:42.499 --> 09:44.217
- <i>Bashert.</i>
- Yeah, that.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.970
It almost sounds like
you'd be willing to give her a look.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.842
- Call Rene, we're going to Hub City.
- Mmm.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.863
<i>Stop!</i>

10:16.449 --> 10:18.952
Wow.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.379
Costume Warehouse having
a fire sale I didn't know about?

10:22.664 --> 10:23.665
What do you what?

10:23.873 --> 10:26.342
You're a vigilante and a meta-human.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.178
For the past three years,
you've been working alone.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.634
We have a proposition for you.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.267
Oh, I'm sorry, you were doing fine.
You take it, yeah.

10:37.762 --> 10:38.888
We'd like you to join us.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.937
<i>I can give you a home,</i>

10:42.267 --> 10:43.393
and a team,

10:43.601 --> 10:46.150
and a place to better train
the use of your power.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.193
I can take care of myself.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.528
Oh, and if you get in my way,

10:53.361 --> 10:55.864
I'll send the three of you back
to Star City with your nuts in a sling.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.341
I thought that went pretty good.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.520
Hey, man, what are
we still doing around this dump?

11:19.220 --> 11:22.224
Leather jacket lady made it seem
pretty clear about us screwing off.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.438
When have you ever known me
to give up that easily?

11:24.601 --> 11:27.275
Never. The answer to that is, "Never."
That might have been implied.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.609
We're not gonna find a better candidate.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.570
Any progress on the facial
recognition from the body cams?

11:31.816 --> 11:33.944
Sorry, but the Wi-Fi
in here is incredibly slow.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.452
You take your time,

11:35.653 --> 11:38.406
I got three patties
and three slices of cheddar to go.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.828
That's disgusting.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.785
Okay, actually, got it.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.166
Our screaming sonic lady has a name.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.715
Tina Boland, formerly of the CCPD.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.543
That tracks, she was in Central City
when the particle accelerator exploded.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.378
And after that she went off the grid,

11:51.544 --> 11:53.467
which means that we have
no way of finding her.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.631
Yes, we do.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.271
- Captain Singh.
- I need information.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.645
- Who is this?
- It's the Green Arrow.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.779
Or some nutjob with a voice modulator.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.486
<i>You want help, I'm gonna need proof.</i>

12:20.865 --> 12:22.082
Very clever.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.710
<i>Fine, what do you wanna know?</i>

12:23.868 --> 12:26.417
Tina Boland.
She was CCPD, what happened to her?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.796
<i>Nothing but tragedy there.</i>

12:27.956 --> 12:30.425
She went deep undercover
and her partner got killed in action.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.715
Her partner's name was...

12:34.504 --> 12:35.551
<i>- Vincent Sobel.
- Yeah.</i>

12:35.713 --> 12:37.386
Tina quit the force
the day after his funeral

12:37.548 --> 12:38.720
and we haven't heard from her since.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.011
<i>- Is she in some kind of trouble?
- Not</i> sure <i>yet.</i>

12:41.636 --> 12:43.013
You get anything, give me a call.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.852
I've always had a soft spot for Boland.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.271
- She's a good kid.
- Will do.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.691
Looks like our Tina is trying
to avenge her former partner.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.200
Which means we have a lead.

13:06.369 --> 13:07.495
Trained Yao Fei?

13:08.329 --> 13:10.582
How's that possible?
You're half his age.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.501
Don't you know it's improper
to talk about a woman's age?

13:15.378 --> 13:17.631
Let's just say it's a family secret.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.892
So, you found me because of Yao Fei?

13:22.051 --> 13:23.177
Congratulations.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.014
Yao Fei's gone.

13:27.265 --> 13:30.064
I found you because
the world needs people like you.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.445
The man who survived all this

13:33.354 --> 13:36.904
is destined for so much more
than playing gangster in Russia.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.411
You know, if you knew me so well,
you'd know that I made a promise...

13:40.570 --> 13:41.867
A promise, yes.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.032
To get revenge on Konstantine Kovar.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.912
I have something that will help.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.459
<i>That is Misha Yurievich,</i>

13:51.080 --> 13:55.551
a black-market smuggler with
a particular specialty, young girls.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.968
You might guess his top customer.

14:00.590 --> 14:01.591
Kovar.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.556
We take down Yurievich
and that leaves Kovar

14:03.760 --> 14:05.103
without his key revenue stream.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.013
<i>NW e?“</i>

14:07.263 --> 14:09.265
You should be honored
I'm offering my services.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.362
Let me help you dispose of Yurievich,

14:14.520 --> 14:16.648
then you will hear me out
with what I have to say.

14:17.857 --> 14:22.283
At the very least, you'll be dealing
a major blow to your enemy.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.746
Oh, thank God. You are a lifesaver.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.461
Yeah, well, I figure you gotta
get your share of fast food

14:34.624 --> 14:37.594
before they lock you up
in Lompoc for hacking the NSA.

14:37.752 --> 14:38.969
Lompoc doesn't house female inmates,

14:39.128 --> 14:40.471
they'd probably send me to Hazelton,

14:40.630 --> 14:43.224
or they would
if there was anything to hack.

14:43.466 --> 14:44.683
Uh, you lost me.

14:44.967 --> 14:48.597
The file containing all the dirt on
General Walker, it's gone. Scrubbed.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.015
So, what does that mean?

14:51.516 --> 14:54.065
Well, it means that John
is back to being totally screwed.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.324
There's no sign of Boland.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.076
<i>You sure this is
the right spot, Mr. Terrific?</i>

15:02.402 --> 15:06.327
Am I still Mr. Terrific if I'm on comms
and not in uniform?

15:07.156 --> 15:10.000
Anyway, yeah, I cross-referenced
the ATM withdrawals,

15:10.159 --> 15:11.832
and pings from a burner cell phone.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.996
Detective Boland is here, room 511,

15:14.205 --> 15:15.752
<i>should be straight down the hall.</i>

15:21.671 --> 15:22.672
Whoa.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.345
Homegirl clearly never met a trash can.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.975
Even though she's not on the force,
she's still playing detective.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.140
No, she's not playing.
She's out for blood.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.062
That's her dead partner.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.069
Mr. Terrific, are you seeing
these names on the body cams?

15:37.645 --> 15:38.692
Already running them.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.196
- Drop the hammer.
- Get out!

15:43.401 --> 15:44.698
No, don't go, help me, please!

15:45.027 --> 15:46.028
Tina...

15:55.079 --> 15:57.423
Sonic dampener, new and improved.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.386
He's dead.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.185
Hello, team?

16:17.351 --> 16:18.944
Looks like we're gonna have some company.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.617
- Can't let her go!
- Get her, I got this.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.104
We didn't get to finish
our last conversation.

17:09.569 --> 17:12.368
- You're persistent.
- You killed that man.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.205
Before, I thought you were worried
I was the one who was gonna end up dead.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.121
- Make up your mind.
- Detective Boland.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.170
If you know I was police,

17:22.333 --> 17:24.882
then you know that guy back in my place
helped kill my partner.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.387
Your vendetta doesn't end with him.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.675
No, I'm still looking for his boss.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.302
His friends are the ones currently
shooting it out with your friends.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.312
We can help you get him without
anyone else dying in the process,

17:35.471 --> 17:37.189
including and especially, you.

17:37.598 --> 17:38.690
You know, from what I hear,

17:38.891 --> 17:40.814
there are plenty of nutcases
running around Star City

17:40.977 --> 17:42.320
looking to make it a better place.

17:43.729 --> 17:44.981
What makes me so special?

17:45.231 --> 17:47.325
Maybe stay in the same spot
for more than a minute

17:47.483 --> 17:48.826
and I'll get a chance to tell it.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.659
Well, if you're gonna make
a sales pitch, make it good.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.288
You went through something traumatic.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.212
For the past three years
you've been trying to understand it

17:59.996 --> 18:03.626
because you're afraid
of what happened to you,

18:04.584 --> 18:06.336
and of what you've become.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.004
So, you're running from it.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.349
- How would you know?
- Because I've been there.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.511
And I can help you find your way back.

18:21.684 --> 18:22.731
Okay.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.356
What's the range on that...

18:27.023 --> 18:29.776
What did you call it, sonic dampener?

18:32.528 --> 18:33.905
That's what I thought.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.300
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.669
You know, I would tell you
to chew with your mouth closed,

18:48.836 --> 18:51.055
but I don't even know how
you could do that with this thing.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.050
Five-stack, baby. Nothing better.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.351
Curtis.

18:56.636 --> 19:00.812
Yeah, so I've made some sense
out of Tina's crazy murder-board.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.560
Meet Sean Sonus.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.400
Three years ago, he was a player in
Central City's criminal underworld

19:06.562 --> 19:08.155
and the target of Tina's investigation.

19:08.314 --> 19:11.739
Interestingly, Sonus disappeared
around the same time that Tina did.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.744
That's why she's been
traveling across the country,

19:13.903 --> 19:14.904
she's been following him.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.907
The only thing I don't understand
is why Sonus is in Hub City now.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.408
Tobias Church.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.210
Your belly hurts?
Yeah, that's not surprising.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.416
"Tobias Church."

19:22.578 --> 19:24.125
He had all the gangs
in Hub City under his thumb,

19:24.288 --> 19:25.710
just like he tried to do back home.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.592
I'm thinking with Church's demise,
it left a power vacuum here,

19:28.751 --> 19:29.877
especially in the drug trade.

19:30.044 --> 19:31.136
What's Sonus pushing?

19:31.295 --> 19:34.174
Some drug I've never
heard of before called "Sly-Dee?"

19:34.340 --> 19:36.638
It's pronounced "slide,"
like in playground,

19:36.801 --> 19:39.645
'cause it hooks kids young and
makes them move to the big stuff faster.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.397
<i>If Boland's after this scumbag,</i>

19:41.555 --> 19:43.557
I vote we get out of her way
and let her do her thing.

19:43.724 --> 19:44.771
<i>I can't believe
I'm about to say this,</i>

19:44.934 --> 19:46.777
but I actually agree with Rene.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.030
- I can't believe it, either.
- And then there's this.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.199
The After-Action Report
on her partner's death.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.827
Sonus' men captured her
and tortured her for two weeks.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.862
So even if she didn't drop
out of the police,

19:57.029 --> 19:58.372
she would have been
put on indefinite leave

19:58.531 --> 19:59.623
because of psychological trauma.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.455
All the more reason
not to leave her out there alone.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.119
Look, I didn't know this Laurel chick,

20:03.536 --> 20:05.755
but you're taking on a lot
to keep this promise to her.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.460
I'm thinking this is about
more than just Laurel.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.625
If Sonus is connected to Church's men,

20:09.834 --> 20:11.461
that makes him more dangerous
than we thought.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.800
We need to find Boland
before she gets involved

20:13.963 --> 20:15.465
in something that she can't handle.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.642
<i>What's the plan?</i>

20:23.347 --> 20:24.394
Follow my lead.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.738
We're walking into a fortress
and you're gonna use just a bow?

20:31.689 --> 20:34.943
To use a bow and arrow
requires patience and discipline.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.667
<i>That's Yurievich.</i>

20:47.830 --> 20:50.003
I will take on his guards, Yurievich...

20:50.166 --> 20:51.543
Yurievich is mine.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.641
Please tell me you didn't sleep down here.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.017
I didn't sleep.

21:01.719 --> 21:05.189
I thought the NSA was a dead end.
The file was erased.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.855
Yeah, but then I remembered nothing
on the internet is ever erased.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.395
<i>Everything leaves behind a digital shadow</i>

21:10.603 --> 21:14.653
and I've been scouring
the dark web trying to find it.

21:16.150 --> 21:18.027
- What's that?
- A terminal message.

21:18.444 --> 21:21.698
- From who?
- I have absolutely no idea.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.457
And how'd they get into your system?

21:24.617 --> 21:25.869
I have absolutely no idea.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.588
<i>- Who's "Ghost Fox Goddess?"
- It's me.</i>

21:30.372 --> 21:31.965
It was my hacker handle in college.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.298
I made a lot of bad choices in college.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.966
What do you mean, bad choices?

21:37.171 --> 21:38.923
I used to be a hacktivist,
it's a hacker activist.

21:39.089 --> 21:40.386
I left that life way behind,

21:40.549 --> 21:42.222
what with the goth look
that was not good for me.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.431
Goth?

21:43.719 --> 21:45.687
Mmm-hmm. Dark hair, dark Felicity,

21:45.888 --> 21:47.515
taking on corporations and governments.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.191
It was a power trip though,
it wasn't healthy.

21:51.352 --> 21:53.070
What's "IRL?"

21:54.772 --> 21:56.069
In real life.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.076
Yo, you know what you're doing there?

22:03.239 --> 22:04.240
Are you kidding me?

22:04.406 --> 22:07.250
I hacked all the traffic cams
in my hometown on a dare.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.420
So, this is gonna help us
find Ms. Loco Bananas?

22:11.163 --> 22:13.040
Or Sonus. Either way...

22:13.207 --> 22:15.801
Either way, we're gonna
put ourselves in the middle

22:16.001 --> 22:19.005
of a showdown between a nutbar
and a psycho drug dealer.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.386
When Oliver explained
his thinking to us on this,

22:21.549 --> 22:24.098
which he rarely ever does, by the way,

22:24.343 --> 22:26.095
I thought you would be more onboard.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.772
How'd the last crazy recruit turn out?

22:28.931 --> 22:32.185
Okay, Evelyn did have her issues,
true, but so did Rory.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.945
And Oliver channeled his vendetta
into something positive.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.948
And as far as nutcases are concerned...

22:39.400 --> 22:41.368
As far as nutcases are concerned, what?

22:41.902 --> 22:42.949
Nothing. I...

22:43.445 --> 22:44.822
That was a... It was a period.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.082
"As far as nutcases are concerned."
Period.

22:47.241 --> 22:48.413
That was just, it wasn't... That's it.

22:48.576 --> 22:50.294
You were thinking of me, weren't you?

22:50.452 --> 22:52.295
I meant it in the nicest way.

22:53.956 --> 22:54.957
I guess you're right.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.508
- I am?
- Yeah.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.968
Maybe this team is all about
finding second chances.

23:05.301 --> 23:08.020
Could you hand me that adapter and tablet?

23:08.178 --> 23:09.225
Yep.

23:10.973 --> 23:11.974
Thanks.

23:17.479 --> 23:20.153
- Got a location.
- Nutbar or psycho drug dealer?

23:21.358 --> 23:23.986
- Psycho drug dealer.
- Great.

23:31.869 --> 23:32.870
Check it out.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.177
Hey, Sean. Been a while.

23:44.632 --> 23:45.849
Detective Boland.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.558
A little outside
your jurisdiction, aren't you?

23:49.720 --> 23:51.017
I'm not a cop tonight.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.113
Get away from her.

24:11.742 --> 24:12.743
Son of a bitch!

24:22.711 --> 24:23.928
What the hell was that?

24:24.964 --> 24:26.011
Sonus...

24:27.216 --> 24:28.763
He's a meta-human, too.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.736
- How is she?
- Still unconscious.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.315
I don't know about you, man,
but my head is still spinning a bit.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.573
It's his meta-power.

24:43.774 --> 24:45.242
I think he can control sonic waves.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.408
It would explain how he disoriented
you guys and counteracted Tina and...

24:50.990 --> 24:52.037
Their powers are related.

24:52.241 --> 24:54.164
- What do you mean?
- I think I have an idea.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.292
I didn't sign up for metas, man.

24:58.455 --> 24:59.707
Enhanced ability or not,

24:59.915 --> 25:02.919
Sonus is running a drug trade
that sells to kids.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.763
If that means we're moving on
from trying to recruit this crazy lady

25:05.921 --> 25:08.595
and focus on taking
down this prig, I'm all in.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.509
Yeah, but we have to find Sonus first.

25:10.676 --> 25:11.768
I know where he's gonna be.

25:13.804 --> 25:14.851
What time is it?

25:15.764 --> 25:18.267
11:40. Where are you going?

25:18.851 --> 25:21.070
Sonus is taking in
a major shipment of Slyde.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.229
And you know where.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.315
And something tells me
you're not gonna tell us.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.989
After three years,
the man who killed my partner

25:28.152 --> 25:30.530
is finally in my sights,
I'm not letting anyone get in my way.

25:30.696 --> 25:33.165
Lady wants to commit suicide,
we should let her.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.415
<i>Free country.</i>

25:38.620 --> 25:40.088
He nearly killed you last time.

25:41.582 --> 25:44.631
Against him, your ability is a liability.

25:46.670 --> 25:47.717
Let us help.

25:50.841 --> 25:53.970
Hey, thanks for the save.
Safe trip back to Star City, boys.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.288
Yurievich is dead.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.582
Good. Now we can talk.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.088
Look sharp.

27:11.296 --> 27:14.891
<i>If this goes south on me,
I want you to take this guy down, hard.</i>

27:15.050 --> 27:16.097
Paranoid much?

27:16.260 --> 27:18.888
You don't know
the dark web like I do, okay?

27:19.054 --> 27:21.807
These guys aren't exactly
known to be friendly.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.067
- OMG!
- OMG.

27:24.226 --> 27:27.196
The Ghost Fox Goddess, here in meatspace.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.981
The real Ghost Fox Goddess!

27:29.773 --> 27:32.617
- You're Kojo Sledgehammer?
- Yeah.

27:32.776 --> 27:35.325
I know it's not nearly as cool
as "Ghost Fox Goddess,"

27:35.487 --> 27:37.910
but then, I can only aspire
to your level of cool.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.576
Which I do. Aspire to, I mean.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.494
Take her down hard, you said, right?

27:45.581 --> 27:46.582
Hey...

27:46.874 --> 27:48.797
It is so great to meet you.

27:49.126 --> 27:50.924
When I saw your traffic on the darknets,

27:51.086 --> 27:52.713
I wasn't even sure it was you.

27:53.130 --> 27:56.555
I mean, you've been a blank
for, well, years.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.802
- I've been busy.
- I know, Palmer Tech.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.017
I just figured
once you got fired, you'd...

28:02.306 --> 28:05.025
- Figured I'd what?
- It's none of my business.

28:06.560 --> 28:07.937
Okay, well,

28:09.813 --> 28:12.316
I became a hacker, a hacktivist,

28:13.150 --> 28:14.777
because of you.

28:15.444 --> 28:16.616
The GFG.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.120
I read about your hack of the
Department of Education, and I was, like,

28:20.616 --> 28:22.368
"I know what I wanna be."

28:22.534 --> 28:25.504
But then you just totally stopped
and became this, like,

28:25.662 --> 28:27.915
information technology
support player and...

28:30.334 --> 28:33.508
Sorry. Never meet your heroes, you know?

28:33.670 --> 28:36.890
No, I haven't just been corporate,
you know, I've been doing work that is...

28:38.091 --> 28:39.217
Important.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.061
If it was, I would've heard about it.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.227
Oh, sorry, there I go again.

28:45.474 --> 28:48.819
I guess I was just excited
when I saw you on the darknets.

28:49.478 --> 28:52.527
It was like...
Like you were returning, you know?

28:53.190 --> 28:54.692
The O.G. GFG was back.

28:56.693 --> 28:59.572
Well, I was looking for an NSA file
to exonerate an innocent man.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.160
- John Diggle.
- Yes.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.456
- My organization does its homework.
- Organization?

29:04.993 --> 29:07.041
A hacktivist group,
we call ourselves Helix.

29:07.621 --> 29:08.668
A month ago, we hacked ECHELON.

29:09.498 --> 29:11.671
- The NSA's information gathering program?
- Mmm-hmm.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.002
We hoovered up eight petabytes of data.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.547
Including everything you need
to help your friend.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.888
We're calling the data cache "Pandora."

29:20.384 --> 29:22.807
With it, you can take down politicians,

29:22.970 --> 29:25.940
bankrupt companies, spark revolutions.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.901
So, you're not just
giving me the file for John?

29:30.435 --> 29:32.813
You inspired me
to make the world a better place.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.199
And now I intend to inspire you

29:38.110 --> 29:39.908
to be the hacktivist you used to be,

29:41.822 --> 29:43.824
the great Ghost Fox Goddess.

30:04.177 --> 30:05.349
Let me guess.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.686
You're trusting me with your mask off
so now I'm supposed to trust you?

30:08.890 --> 30:12.019
No, I just thought that if you weren't
gonna listen to the Green Arrow,

30:12.185 --> 30:13.812
that you might listen to Oliver Queen.

30:14.604 --> 30:15.696
Nice to meet you.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.738
I spent five years in hell.

30:19.901 --> 30:20.948
Not unlike what happened to you

30:21.111 --> 30:23.239
when you were undercover
in Sonus' organization.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.250
Or what he put you through when
he discovered you were a cop.

30:28.535 --> 30:31.254
And, what, you think you see
a little bit of yourself in me?

30:31.413 --> 30:32.756
It's more than that.

30:34.041 --> 30:35.918
There is a man in Star City

30:36.626 --> 30:37.923
who's trying to convince me

30:38.086 --> 30:40.088
that I destroy the lives
of everyone that I touch

30:40.380 --> 30:41.882
because I am beyond redemption.

30:42.049 --> 30:44.017
Yeah, and you think if you can save me
you'll prove him wrong?

30:44.176 --> 30:46.679
- Don't put your issues on me.
- Absolutely right.

30:48.305 --> 30:51.559
But if you think that you can take on
Sonus and his men then you are wrong.

30:53.935 --> 30:54.936
Let us help.

30:56.146 --> 30:59.821
Let us help, and then we're gone.

31:15.957 --> 31:16.958
<i>All right.</i>

31:17.209 --> 31:20.088
I'm reading fifteen shooters
on the roof and a helicopter inbound.

31:24.132 --> 31:25.224
Copy, we're in position.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.644
Shipment's late.

31:28.929 --> 31:30.431
Some screw-up in Blüdhaven.

31:30.722 --> 31:31.769
Take a hundred grand off.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.859
- We need to move.
- Patience.

31:35.477 --> 31:37.320
You still have Curtis'
insurance policy with you?

31:38.105 --> 31:41.154
Yeah, but I'm still gonna
get to use my guns, right?

31:43.151 --> 31:44.528
<i>Chopper's about to land, guys.</i>

31:45.278 --> 31:46.325
Move.

31:53.995 --> 31:54.996
Kill 'em all!

32:11.763 --> 32:13.515
Not so fast, dirtbag.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.143
Yes! Yes.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.067
They got air support.

32:24.359 --> 32:25.702
All right, I'll take care of it.
But, Wild Dog...

32:25.861 --> 32:26.908
I got her six.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.246
Guess I should be flattered.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.296
To think you've held out a candle
for me after all these years.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.630
- What are you waiting for?
- Tina...

33:29.049 --> 33:31.973
Don't do it. You're better than this.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.346
You know I'm not.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.604
If we're as alike as you said,
we both know you'd kill him.

33:38.892 --> 33:39.939
You're right.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.113
Maybe it's too late for me,

33:45.106 --> 33:46.904
and maybe I don't get a second chance.

33:49.611 --> 33:51.579
You don't have to go down that road.

33:55.242 --> 33:57.461
Do you know what
would Vince want you to do?

34:08.295 --> 34:09.592
He'd want me to do that.

34:16.221 --> 34:17.313
<i>He'!-</i>

34:20.809 --> 34:21.810
Let her go.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.991
Hey. Oh, man.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.206
I was gonna ask how
it went with the new Canary,

34:39.369 --> 34:42.088
but I can tell by that look on your face.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.634
- Well, I have some good news, though.
- I am in the market.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.929
I've got all we need to exonerate John.

34:52.340 --> 34:53.808
That's incredible. How'd you do that?

34:56.177 --> 34:57.349
Long story.

34:58.346 --> 35:01.145
Is there something you're not telling me?

35:01.391 --> 35:03.610
I know that we are
not used to getting good news,

35:04.811 --> 35:06.734
but this is what it looks like.

35:08.690 --> 35:11.284
Lam gonna go leak the file on Walker.

35:12.402 --> 35:13.654
Why don't you go tell John the good news?

35:46.936 --> 35:49.064
- What's going on?
- You tell him.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.574
Tell me what?

35:51.733 --> 35:54.907
Earlier this evening, I received
the NSA's case against Walker

35:55.070 --> 35:57.323
- from an anonymous source.
- Anonymous?

35:57.489 --> 35:59.537
<i>On the strength of it,
I went to the Judge Advocate</i>

35:59.699 --> 36:01.576
<i>ex parte,</i> and got you released on bail.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.495
Wait, what?

36:03.662 --> 36:04.914
I filed a motion to dismiss

36:05.080 --> 36:06.878
which is as close to
a slam dunk as these things get,

36:07.040 --> 36:08.257
given the cards we're holding.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.459
What does this mean?

36:10.210 --> 36:13.430
It means that you can go home,
and hug your wife and son.

36:24.974 --> 36:28.899
You wanted this, baited me with Yurievich.

36:30.438 --> 36:31.439
Yes.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.034
To see for yourself what I've become?

36:35.318 --> 36:36.535
To remind you.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.031
Why go to all the trouble?

36:40.448 --> 36:42.951
Huh? What do you care?
You don't even know me.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.540
I thought I'd proven otherwise.

36:47.122 --> 36:51.002
General Shrieve, Baron Reiter,
Konstantine Kovar.

36:51.167 --> 36:53.090
You keep looking for new fights

36:53.253 --> 36:55.847
when the real fight has been
in front of you all along.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.134
Your father literally wrote it for you,

36:59.300 --> 37:03.100
a list of all the Yurievichs
and Kovars in Starling City.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.981
He told me. He left me a message.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.767
And yet you still don't return home.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.276
Why do you deny
your father's wish for you?

37:09.436 --> 37:11.109
You saw the reason tonight.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.194
I am not the man that my father raised.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.401
Not anymore.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.871
You're afraid of what's happened to you,

37:20.029 --> 37:22.498
of what you've become,
and you're running from it.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.626
- How do you know all this?
- Because I've been there.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.173
And I can help you find your way back.

37:37.338 --> 37:38.965
You think yourself a monster.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.093
No.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.143
I am a monster.

37:52.937 --> 37:57.192
There is a monster inside you,
yes, but it is not you.

37:58.651 --> 37:59.698
I don't see the difference.

37:59.861 --> 38:02.580
No, you need to create one.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.995
You need to give the monster an identity.

38:10.246 --> 38:12.465
It's only when the monster
becomes someone else,

38:14.000 --> 38:18.631
something else,
that you're free to be Oliver Queen.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.067
I don't know if I'm ready.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.237
I will help you become ready.

38:52.497 --> 38:53.919
<i>Mr. Mayor, excuse me,</i>

38:54.082 --> 38:56.961
but there's someone here to see you.
Her name is Tina Boland.

38:57.252 --> 38:59.129
Yeah, send her in, please.

39:06.094 --> 39:08.938
Mayor Queen. It's impressive.

39:10.932 --> 39:12.605
Maybe you should've led with that.

39:13.977 --> 39:18.073
I gotta admit,
I didn't think I'd see you again.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.157
Yeah, neither did I.

39:23.653 --> 39:27.328
I guess I thought
I would feel different...

39:29.284 --> 39:30.957
...with Sonus gone.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.787
I thought I would feel...

39:34.664 --> 39:36.837
- Liberated.
- I wish it worked that way.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.135
How do you do it?

39:47.886 --> 39:50.389
How do you keep living with so much pain?

39:51.055 --> 39:53.103
I'm still working on that myself.

39:55.018 --> 39:57.521
But I can tell you
it helps to not be alone.

39:59.522 --> 40:00.899
That's why you're here, right?

40:04.819 --> 40:06.116
That's why I'm here.

40:09.449 --> 40:12.043
Back on the roof, you asked
what Vince would have wanted.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.294
We were more than just partners,

40:18.875 --> 40:20.127
we were lovers.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.298
I hated Sonus for killing Vince.

40:26.883 --> 40:31.138
But I hated myself more
for not being able to stop him.

40:31.554 --> 40:34.273
Rene, the guy in the hockey mask,

40:36.184 --> 40:38.357
told the other guy
that was with us, Curtis,

40:40.521 --> 40:43.525
that this team is all about
finding second chances.

40:45.318 --> 40:47.161
You said maybe
we don't get second chances.

40:47.362 --> 40:48.614
Well, maybe I was wrong.

40:51.407 --> 40:52.875
Maybe you're my second chance.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.797
That's a lot to put on my shoulders.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.209
Well, Tina, there's something
that tells me you can handle it.

41:05.046 --> 41:06.389
So about that name...

41:07.382 --> 41:10.511
"Tina Boland" was my official cover
for undercover work.

41:11.219 --> 41:12.562
It was to protect my family.

41:14.097 --> 41:16.225
My real name is Dinah.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.067
Dinah Drake.

41:22.397 --> 41:23.444
Dinah?

41:24.190 --> 41:25.612
Does that name mean something to you?

41:26.150 --> 41:27.276
I had a friend named Dinah.

41:29.946 --> 41:31.619
She's the reason I sought you out.

41:34.409 --> 41:36.332
What do you think
she'd think about all this?

41:38.621 --> 41:40.419
I think she'd be proud of both of us.
