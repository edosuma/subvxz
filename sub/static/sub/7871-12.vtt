Everything I know about women

01:06.768 --> 01:08.669
can be summed up
by a jump-rope rhyme:

01:08.703 --> 01:10.738
"Girls go to Mars
to buy candy bars,

01:10.772 --> 01:13.190
boys go to Jupiter
to get more stupider."

01:13.224 --> 01:15.592
Except I didn't have to go
to Jupiter to get stupider.

01:16.761 --> 01:19.229
I had a bigger ball of gas
I could study.

Turn right
Homer, watch the road!

Not this road, the other road!

01:40.869 --> 01:42.169
Hmm.
What the...?

01:43.872 --> 01:45.706
Switching to male voice...

01:45.740 --> 01:47.491
...so you will obey.

01:49.461 --> 01:50.627

So the closest thing I had

01:52.197 --> 01:53.497
to an adult male role model

01:53.531 --> 01:55.165
were the schoolyard bullies.

in Skinner's sloppy joe?

overcame a bout of
prairie madness,

09:58.435 --> 10:01.804
an angry woman would say
"Everything's fine."

10:05.375 --> 10:07.526
I guess it's just me
and the dog.

10:11.114 --> 10:13.299
Everything's fine.

10:14.334 --> 10:15.935
Now.

10:28.132 --> 10:29.232
Melvis?

10:29.266 --> 10:30.366
Where's Mary?

10:30.401 --> 10:32.802
I brung you regrets
from my sister.

10:32.836 --> 10:36.039
She has been
de-avoidably untained.

10:36.073 --> 10:37.940
Am I getting dumped?

10:39.276 --> 10:42.578
Okay, Bart, maybe you blew it
by taking Mary for granted.

10:42.613 --> 10:45.114
Woman are life's
great mystery, along with

10:45.149 --> 10:48.117
why do they give you salt and
pepper at a Chinese restaurant?

10:48.152 --> 10:50.053
But if you want one more shot,

10:50.087 --> 10:53.122
I know a date that will turn
this mighty Aphrodite

10:53.157 --> 10:55.725
into your purple rose
of Cairo.

10:55.759 --> 10:58.328
Those are movies I made.

10:58.362 --> 11:00.229
It's my oeuvre.

11:00.264 --> 11:02.865
It sounds dirty,
but it's not.

11:13.961 --> 11:15.495
Everyone's fast asleep.

11:15.546 --> 11:17.430
It's like my second
wedding night,

11:17.464 --> 11:20.066
except more walkouts
and there were no refunds.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.551
Gee...

11:24.104 --> 11:26.272
Can I see you
tomorrow night?

11:26.306 --> 11:28.474
Sure, I'll be here
with my other boyfriend.

11:28.509 --> 11:29.976
He's watching us now.

11:30.010 --> 11:31.561
Oh, boy.

11:33.297 --> 11:35.481
Okay, Luann,
it's all settled.

11:35.516 --> 11:36.933
We're gonna ditch Milhouse.

11:36.967 --> 11:40.453
Bart, I think it's best
if we take a break.

11:40.487 --> 11:43.189
Good idea, I can chuck
eggs at the other couples.

11:43.223 --> 11:46.209
Just hug me, dummy.

11:52.249 --> 11:53.449
Back pats?

11:53.484 --> 11:54.867
This is a breakup.

11:58.572 --> 11:59.839
You'll be fine.

11:59.873 --> 12:01.708
There's a pot
for every possum.

12:01.742 --> 12:03.076
Give me another chance.

12:03.110 --> 12:05.011
I'll be way more attentive
to your needs on the seesaw.

12:05.045 --> 12:07.196
I'll stay down there
for as long as you want.

12:07.231 --> 12:09.899
Sorry, Bart,
I'm a hillbilly girl of 13.

12:09.933 --> 12:11.467
If I'm not married
in the next few months,

12:11.502 --> 12:13.269
nobody's gonna want me.

12:13.303 --> 12:15.071
Not even old Joe Clabby.

12:15.105 --> 12:17.173
Hey, you're a pretty
little thing, you are,

12:17.207 --> 12:19.642
but ticktock, ticktock.

12:19.676 --> 12:22.011
Good-bye, Bart.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.629
Aw, sweetie.

12:23.664 --> 12:26.999
I told you this would happen
if you dated outside the family.

12:27.034 --> 12:28.251
Mm-mm-mm.

12:30.304 --> 12:32.171
Move along,
relationship's over.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.908
Sure do like forcing
people to leave areas.

12:35.943 --> 12:37.660
Yeah.

12:39.113 --> 12:41.247
I was the only without a date

12:41.281 --> 12:44.650
at Patty's new lady friend's
travel bookstore soft opening.

12:44.685 --> 12:47.086
You told me it was up to me
if I wanted to go.

12:47.121 --> 12:49.655
You should know that me saying
I don't care

12:49.690 --> 12:51.657
means I couldn't care more.

12:51.692 --> 12:55.261
I am sick and tired of trying
to decode you like you're some

12:55.295 --> 12:58.231
kind of human being
separate from myself.

12:58.265 --> 12:59.632
Bart, would you
go to your room

12:59.666 --> 13:01.701
while your father and I
finish our little talk?

13:01.735 --> 13:02.935
Little talk?

13:02.970 --> 13:04.437
You guys are having a big fight.

13:04.471 --> 13:06.439
This is the problem with women--
they don't say

13:06.473 --> 13:08.374
what they mean
until it's too late.

13:08.408 --> 13:10.009
All right, fine.

13:10.043 --> 13:13.079
If you boys want it, I'll
tell you what I really think.

13:13.113 --> 13:15.214
Finally, we're
getting somewhere.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.334
You're both
in the doghouse,

13:18.368 --> 13:22.071
which is misleading
'cause I still like the dog.

13:23.407 --> 13:26.142
Hand me my suitcase, boy.

13:26.176 --> 13:27.977
When do I get
a Krusty suitcase?

13:28.011 --> 13:29.479
When you're older.

13:33.251 --> 13:35.886
So this is where you go
when Mom kicks you out?

13:35.921 --> 13:37.988
You're saying it like
it happens all the time.

13:38.023 --> 13:40.724
And by the way,
the paint's a little faded

13:40.759 --> 13:42.226
on my parking spot.

13:42.260 --> 13:44.829
You call this a platinum
club experience?

13:44.863 --> 13:46.397
We'll get right on it,
Mr. Simpson.

13:46.431 --> 13:49.900
I told you a thousand times,
call me Homer.

13:51.336 --> 13:53.153
Oh, what's this notice
on the wall?

13:53.188 --> 13:54.655
Standard hotel boilerplate.

13:54.689 --> 13:57.925
It just says somebody died in
this room in the last 72 hours.

13:57.959 --> 14:00.194
Aw, man, we
just missed it.

14:00.228 --> 14:02.062
Oh,
it'll happen again, son.

14:02.097 --> 14:03.964
Um, I've got to make
a phone call.

14:03.999 --> 14:06.383
Eh, knock yourself out.

14:06.418 --> 14:07.568
D'oh!

14:07.602 --> 14:08.736
Not again.

14:11.756 --> 14:13.574
Mary? Ooh, that's odd.

14:13.608 --> 14:15.543
I thought I was calling
the Suicide <i>Not</i> Line,

14:15.577 --> 14:17.478
because I'm doing great.

14:17.512 --> 14:20.981
So, um, how are you
handling taking a break?

14:21.016 --> 14:24.285
Great.
Turns out Adele was right.

14:24.319 --> 14:26.220
Ain't nothing better
for songwriting

14:26.254 --> 14:29.290
than when your relationship
takes a bolt to the brain.

14:29.324 --> 14:30.758

15:29.434 --> 15:30.701
but your mother
wouldn't let me do it.

15:30.735 --> 15:32.736
shows how much she...

15:32.771 --> 15:34.171
It's hurting my eyes!

15:40.211 --> 15:42.713
It's so great here--
no wife to get mad at you

15:42.747 --> 15:45.516
for closing your laptop whenever
they walk into the room.

15:45.550 --> 15:47.418
Or getting your kid
hooked on pot.

15:47.452 --> 15:48.986
She's my kid,
too, you know.

15:50.689 --> 15:51.922
You know what we need?

15:51.957 --> 15:54.491
A classic "kicked out
of the house" party.

15:54.526 --> 15:55.693
Now, who's got a rocking CD?

15:55.727 --> 15:57.027
I've got the audio book

15:57.062 --> 15:59.029
of Robert Caro's
<i>The Passage of Power.</i>

15:59.064 --> 16:00.230
That's it?

16:00.265 --> 16:04.068
Well, then let's "power"
this party up.

16:05.270 --> 16:06.670
Air Force One,

16:06.705 --> 16:09.273
the president's plane,
is divided behind

16:09.307 --> 16:11.225
the crew's cockpit
into three compartments.

16:11.259 --> 16:14.478
In the first of them,
just behind the cockpit,

16:14.512 --> 16:16.280
women sat weeping
and Secret Service agents

16:16.314 --> 16:19.016
were trying
to hold back tears.

16:19.050 --> 16:20.617
"You've heard
of strong men crying?

16:20.652 --> 16:22.703
Well, we had it there that day,"
recalls a reporter.

16:22.737 --> 16:26.306
As the pilot lifted the big jet
off the Dallas runway,

16:26.341 --> 16:28.959
in a climb so steep
that to a man...

16:28.994 --> 16:30.411
I miss Mary.

16:30.445 --> 16:31.845
I miss Roxie.

16:31.863 --> 16:34.415
That's the club where I used
to smoke pot with my kid.

16:34.449 --> 16:36.817
This calls for decisive action.

16:36.851 --> 16:39.386
Like LBJ's use of the period
of mourning following

16:39.421 --> 16:41.922
the assassination to push
through the Civil Rights Act.

16:41.956 --> 16:44.158
But how do we figure
out what to do?

16:44.192 --> 16:45.859
The same way Hollywood does.

16:45.894 --> 16:47.995
By watching British movies.

16:50.465 --> 16:51.598
The Prime Minister,

16:51.633 --> 16:53.400
that is to say, I would like

16:53.435 --> 16:55.185
to make an emergency declaration

16:55.220 --> 16:57.104
of love to my poor

16:57.138 --> 16:58.322

16:58.356 --> 17:00.824
What, me?
Eliza Commonbottom?

Agreed, but to win
back our women,
