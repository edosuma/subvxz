00:12.662 --> 00:16.582
there's a hound dog
out in Texas

00:16.650 --> 00:20.319
he says he belongs to me

00:20.386 --> 00:24.323
when he's on the trail
I can follow his tail

00:24.390 --> 00:28.160
through the land
of the wild country

00:28.228 --> 00:32.363
he was born to roam
the mountains

00:32.432 --> 00:35.868
the prairie land so free

00:35.936 --> 00:40.089
he can go anywhere
run the fat from a bear

00:40.156 --> 00:44.560
chase a bobcat
to his mountain lair

00:44.628 --> 00:48.397
or run him up a tree

00:48.465 --> 00:51.901
in the land
of the wild country

00:51.968 --> 00:55.638
I call my hound dog
Savage Sam

00:55.705 --> 00:59.792
he runs so wild and free

00:59.859 --> 01:03.896
and if he don't know
where I am

01:03.964 --> 01:07.366
he takes after me

01:07.433 --> 01:11.236
through the land
of the wild country

01:11.304 --> 01:15.107
we were born
to love the country

01:15.175 --> 01:19.094
old Savage Sam and me

01:19.162 --> 01:23.082
we were born in the west
in the land that's best

01:23.150 --> 01:26.919
but folks out here
never get much rest

01:26.987 --> 01:30.656
with dogs
and boys like me

01:30.723 --> 01:34.427
in the land
of the wild country

01:34.494 --> 01:39.164
I call my hound dog
Savage Sam

01:39.232 --> 01:43.435
he runs so wild
and free

01:43.503 --> 01:47.106
and if he don't know
where I am

01:47.173 --> 01:51.126
he takes after me

01:51.194 --> 01:54.429
through the land
of the wild country

01:54.497 --> 01:58.133
we were born
to love the country

01:58.201 --> 02:02.104
old Savage Sam and me

02:02.172 --> 02:06.425
we were born in the west
in the land that's best

02:06.492 --> 02:09.995
but folks out here
never get much rest

02:10.062 --> 02:13.065
with dogs
and boys like me

02:13.133 --> 02:19.955
in the land
of the wild country

03:29.625 --> 03:32.761
Sam, you thievin' rascal,

03:32.829 --> 03:34.897
You better
let me have that.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.934
A little savage, ain't ya?

03:39.002 --> 03:41.236
Old Savage Sam.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.738
All right, keep it.

03:43.806 --> 03:47.142
But I tell you, if Travis catches
you with that side of meat,

03:47.210 --> 03:51.080
He's just liable to knock you
Sky west and crooked.

04:14.470 --> 04:18.156
Dang your hide, Jumper!
Get out of there!

04:18.224 --> 04:21.226
How many times do I gotta tell
you to quit eatin' the sweet corn?

04:23.213 --> 04:25.064
Now git!

04:37.360 --> 04:39.461
Bit off more
than you could chew, huh?

04:45.918 --> 04:47.853
What's for breakfast?

04:47.920 --> 04:51.123
Bacon and mush. And milk,
after you finish the milkin'.

04:51.191 --> 04:54.093
Bacon and mush.
Bacon and mush.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.129
Every mornin' in the world
it's bacon and mush.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.114
Why don't you cook something
different once in a while...

04:59.182 --> 05:01.049
Than bacon and mush
like Mama does?

05:01.117 --> 05:03.118
'cause I'm not Mama,
that's why.

05:03.186 --> 05:05.987
Now you better
go milk that cow.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.090
Milk the dang cow.
If you get an early start,

05:08.158 --> 05:11.160
Maybe we can finish scrubbing
that new patch of ground by night.

05:11.227 --> 05:14.430
How much longer will Mama
and Papa be in San Antone?

05:14.497 --> 05:16.432
Oh, could be
a couple of weeks yet.

05:16.499 --> 05:18.434
Till Grandma dies?

05:18.501 --> 05:20.436
Now who said
she's gonna die?

05:20.503 --> 05:24.089
You know, Grandma won't
like it up there in Heaven.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.459
There's nothing to do all day
but squat around on a cloud,

05:27.527 --> 05:29.862
Trying to pick
one of them old guitars.

05:29.929 --> 05:32.547
Harps, not guitars.

05:32.615 --> 05:35.150
Harps, guitars...
it's all the same difference.

05:35.218 --> 05:38.420
Grandma don't know
how to play neither one.

05:38.488 --> 05:41.323
Grandma's been sick before,
and she's got well.

05:41.391 --> 05:44.025
<i>Of course, maybe they'll
teach her how to play.</i>

05:44.093 --> 05:47.128
I don't suppose them angels
has got much else to do.

05:47.196 --> 05:49.014
What's all this talk
about dying?

05:49.082 --> 05:52.751
I was just thinking,
if Grandma dies,

05:52.818 --> 05:55.220
Mama's gonna be mighty sad.

05:55.288 --> 05:58.023
It'll mean she'll have to
wait around until she dies...

05:58.091 --> 06:00.526
Before she gets to
see Grandma again.

06:00.593 --> 06:02.995
Then we'll all be
tore up 'cause we

06:02.996 --> 06:05.397
won't get to see Mama
again till we die.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.732
I don't like it.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.951
Well, don't worry about it
and maybe you'll live longer.

06:10.019 --> 06:13.622
Me, I ain't never gonna die.
I'm gonna live forever.

06:13.690 --> 06:17.342
Why don't you milk that cow so you
have something to live on? Now git.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.546
Milk the cow.
Grub the brush.

06:21.614 --> 06:24.015
Bacon and mush.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.318
Arliss.
What?

06:27.653 --> 06:30.689
You know, I was just thinkin'
we could use some fresh meat.

06:30.757 --> 06:34.426
And if we get through with the
work in time, we might go huntin'.

06:34.493 --> 06:36.428
Huntin'?
You mean it?

06:36.495 --> 06:38.430
That's if we get through
with the work,

06:38.498 --> 06:41.099
Which won't be likely
if you don't get to the milkin'.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.427
I'll have that old
cow dry as a sunflower

06:43.428 --> 06:45.687
pod afore the
bacon's half fried.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.248
old Dan Tucker
was a mighty man

06:56.316 --> 06:59.084
he washed his face
in a frying pan

06:59.152 --> 07:01.620
combed his hair
with a wagon wheel

07:01.687 --> 07:04.422
and he died of a toothache
on his heel

07:04.490 --> 07:07.909
so get out the way
for old Dan Tucker

07:07.977 --> 07:10.361
get out the way
for old Dan Tucker

07:10.429 --> 07:13.165
<i>get out the way
for old Dan Tucker</i>

07:13.233 --> 07:16.501
he's too lazy
to come to supper

08:23.553 --> 08:25.620
Get him, Sam!

08:27.240 --> 08:30.542
Fire right back, Sam!
Fire right back, boy!

08:36.365 --> 08:39.601
Out fancy her, boy!

08:40.886 --> 08:44.073
Go on, in and out. She'll
never lay a horn to ya!

08:51.797 --> 08:53.615
What on earth?

08:58.421 --> 09:00.522
<i>yee-haw!</i>

09:04.661 --> 09:07.212
Arliss, get that dog
outta here!

09:10.816 --> 09:13.318
Dang you, Sam.
Now git!

09:13.385 --> 09:15.420
Travis,
you quit taking sides!

09:15.488 --> 09:17.422
Go on!
Get outta here!

09:17.490 --> 09:21.409
It's all right, Sam. You
had her beat. Get outta here!

09:21.477 --> 09:25.213
I sent you out here to milk, not
start a stampede. I was milkin'.

09:25.281 --> 09:29.350
<i>easy, girl, easy.
Easy, girl. Easy, girl.</i>

09:29.418 --> 09:30.827
Actin' like a six
year old. I oughta

09:30.828 --> 09:32.237
cut me a sprout and
thrash your britches.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.706
Guess you think you're
the boss, big as Papa, huh?

09:34.774 --> 09:38.076
Well, Papa left me in charge and
said for you to do what I said!

09:38.144 --> 09:41.012
Now go calm that cow down
and finish milkin'!

09:42.615 --> 09:44.633
All right.

09:47.002 --> 09:49.204
Make me!

09:51.691 --> 09:54.176
I'll bash you
with this bucket!

09:57.830 --> 10:00.365
Wait till I get
my hands on you.

10:01.784 --> 10:04.052
Arliss!

10:05.972 --> 10:08.106
Ow! Arliss!

10:09.492 --> 10:11.593
Ow! You quit chuckin' me,
you hear?

10:11.661 --> 10:13.528
I hear!

10:22.072 --> 10:24.706
Arliss, you quit that, or these
chickens won't lay for a month.

10:33.282 --> 10:36.851
<i>Sic him, Sam. Grab him!
-Arliss!</i>

10:41.040 --> 10:44.242
I'll learn you
to boss me around.

10:46.028 --> 10:49.097
Stay with him, Sam!
Arliss! Sam, quit that.

10:54.704 --> 10:58.490
<i>you quit hittin' my dog!</i>

11:12.722 --> 11:15.390
When I get outta here, I'll
wear your tail end to a frazzle.

11:16.259 --> 11:20.245
Arliss!
Uncle Beck!

11:20.313 --> 11:22.247
Say, what's going on?

11:23.582 --> 11:25.717
I could hear you hollering
on the next ridge.

11:27.086 --> 11:29.020
Oh, what'd you got treed
there, a panther?

11:29.088 --> 11:32.407
No, sir. Just Travis.

11:32.475 --> 11:36.578
Travis? You mean your
brother Travis? Yes, sir.

11:36.646 --> 11:38.880
Well, I'll be doggoned.
What you rockin' him for?

11:38.947 --> 11:41.649
Well, dang it, he's getting
too big for his britches!

11:41.801 --> 11:43.735
He's always
bossing me around.

11:43.887 --> 11:47.923
Oh. Tellin' you what you can
do and what you can't, huh?

11:47.991 --> 11:51.126
Yes, sir. He never lets me
have a say about nothin'.

11:51.194 --> 11:53.779
and he works me
like a slave.

11:53.846 --> 11:56.981
<i>Tsk, tsk, tsk. Well, I don't
blame you for rockin' him then.</i>

11:57.049 --> 11:58.867
You don't?
No, sir.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.169
If it was me, I wouldn't
stand for it one minute.

12:01.237 --> 12:03.772
'cause I know what you're going
through, Arliss, 'cause your Papa...

12:03.840 --> 12:07.175
Used to treat me exactly the
same way when I was little.

12:07.243 --> 12:10.045
Every minute of the day,
something like this,

12:10.112 --> 12:12.047
"Beck, you go chop
the wood.

12:12.114 --> 12:15.784
"Beck, go fetch the horses.
Beck, go slop the hogs.

12:15.852 --> 12:17.786
Beck, go milk the cow."

12:17.854 --> 12:22.640
That's why I wanted to kill
him a thousand times. Who, Papa?

12:22.708 --> 12:25.743
You betcha. Anything
makes me killin' mad...

12:25.811 --> 12:28.046
Is some great big, lazy,
overgrown boy...

12:28.113 --> 12:30.382
Workin' his poor little brother
half to death.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.954
Let's get some brush. We'll set
fire to it and burn him out of there.

12:37.022 --> 12:38.956
Burn him out?
Sure.

12:39.024 --> 12:40.958
Like smokin' a possum
out of a hollow log.

12:41.026 --> 12:43.712
You mean,
do that to Travis?

12:43.779 --> 12:46.881
Well, no,
that wouldn't do neither, no.

12:46.949 --> 12:51.285
Dang fire's liable to spread
and burn the whole place down.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.988
Well, here you go.
Use this.

12:54.056 --> 12:56.124
Blast him outta there
with that.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.093
Now, it'll make some holes in that
door you could pitch a dog through.

12:59.161 --> 13:01.095
But that's Travis
in there.

13:01.163 --> 13:04.032
I know that, Arliss.
That's what you been telling me.

13:04.099 --> 13:07.318
Now keep that arm steady,
boy. Steady.

13:07.386 --> 13:10.505
see, now get
that front side down.

13:10.573 --> 13:13.708
Make her set right there
in the middle of that groove.

13:13.776 --> 13:16.461
Remember, you gotta squeeze
that trigger.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.431
Aim a foot below the top of that
door, and you're gonna catch him...

13:19.498 --> 13:21.766
Right smack between the eyes
on the first shot.

13:21.834 --> 13:24.669
You crazy or something? You
think I wanna kill my own brother?

13:24.737 --> 13:26.638
Well, Arliss, that's the
general idea I got from

13:26.639 --> 13:28.540
the way you was whammin'
them rocks in there.

13:28.607 --> 13:31.376
Well, I didn't aim
to kill him.

13:31.444 --> 13:35.680
Oh. But you kill squirrels
with rocks, don't you?

13:37.566 --> 13:41.102
And you killed that big
turkey gobbler with a rock.

13:41.170 --> 13:43.104
Didn't you?

13:46.358 --> 13:50.395
Now, I believe if it was me, I'd just
go wash the dirt out of that bucket...

13:50.462 --> 13:52.597
And finish milkin' up
the cow.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.366
Yes, sir.

13:55.434 --> 13:57.736
Ah, ahem.

13:57.804 --> 14:01.590
I reckon she'll give you the milk
without you holdin' my gun on her.

14:01.657 --> 14:04.009
Huh?

14:04.076 --> 14:06.811
Oh.

14:06.879 --> 14:08.696
I reckon she will.

14:27.984 --> 14:30.051
I don't see how you do it,
Uncle Beck.

14:30.119 --> 14:35.023
Now, any way I try to manage him, it's
like pokin' a stick in a hornet's nest.

14:35.091 --> 14:38.493
Well, that's generally the case
with being the older brother, Travis.

14:39.795 --> 14:42.430
Maybe what you gotta do
is learn to out figure him.

14:43.699 --> 14:47.969
hey, smells like
something's afire.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.522
It's the bacon!

15:14.697 --> 15:17.715
Dang that Arliss!

15:23.972 --> 15:25.773
Can't even milk a cow.

15:27.410 --> 15:31.313
Hey, I picked... whee... I
picked this up in town for you.

15:31.380 --> 15:33.815
A letter. Yep,
San Antone it says.

15:33.882 --> 15:35.951
It must be
from your Mama and Papa.

15:42.641 --> 15:44.976
Mama says the doctor had
Grandma figured for a goner,

15:45.044 --> 15:46.961
<i>But she fooled them.</i>

15:47.029 --> 15:48.963
That don't surprise me none.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.899
Crowd you to kill that little
ol' lady with a choppin' axe.

15:51.967 --> 15:53.901
That's about the way
Mama puts it.

15:53.969 --> 15:57.272
She says, "it will be a while
before Grandma is back on her feet.

15:57.340 --> 15:59.974
But she's
just doing fine."

16:00.042 --> 16:01.909
Well, I bet on it too.

16:04.012 --> 16:08.115
I never will forget that
little old lady back in Sedalia.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.251
When me and your Papa was
nothin' but tow-shirted kids,

16:10.319 --> 16:13.888
We couldn't swipe a peach,
turpentine a cat,

16:13.955 --> 16:15.890
Ride the old milk calf,
nothin',

16:15.957 --> 16:19.427
Without Grandma Bailey swarmin'
all over us, three times a day.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.781
Burnt the breakfast,
didn't you?

16:23.849 --> 16:26.835
I got another batch started.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.137
Mama never let
the breakfast get burnt.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.139
<i>Always had it
ready for me to eat,</i>

16:31.207 --> 16:33.241
The minute
I finished milkin'.

16:33.309 --> 16:35.594
Now, maybe your
Mama didn't have to

16:35.595 --> 16:37.879
spend so much time
duckin' rocks neither.

16:37.946 --> 16:41.599
I best be movin' on. Oh,
you don't aim to eat with us?

16:41.667 --> 16:43.468
No thanks.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.470
I don't blame you...
bacon and mush.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.939
I ate early. I got to
hunt up a missing heifer.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.276
Probably hold up in some thicket
with a new calf. New calf!

16:51.344 --> 16:53.895
Golly, maybe I better
go help you hunt her.

16:53.962 --> 16:55.697
Now you better help
your brother finish the

16:55.698 --> 16:57.432
grubbin' because your
Papa wants to sow...

16:57.500 --> 17:00.835
That new ground of winter
wheat, quick as he gets home.

17:00.903 --> 17:03.037
Aw, heck!

17:06.124 --> 17:08.542
You need any help,
you let me know, hear?

17:08.611 --> 17:10.679
I'll be looking in on you
every now and then.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.185
You remember what I said now.
You got to learn to outfigure him.

17:18.253 --> 17:20.855
Outfigure who?

17:20.923 --> 17:23.191
Outfigure who?
Oh...

17:23.259 --> 17:25.492
nobody.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.695
Nobody particular.

17:27.762 --> 17:31.633
Well, holler when the bacon's
fried. I'm near starved.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.152
Where you going?

17:35.220 --> 17:38.356
While you're cookin' up the grub,
I'll go harness up Old Jumper.

17:38.424 --> 17:41.042
He can pack in the deer we
shoot when we go huntin'.

17:41.110 --> 17:43.303
I said we might go when
we get the work done.

17:43.304 --> 17:45.496
There's plenty of
time to get Old Jumper.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.666
I need him, anyhow,
to ride to work on.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.702
Ride? That field
ain't a quarter mile off.

17:51.770 --> 17:56.624
If you think I'm gonna do all that
walkin', then work too, you're crazy.

17:56.691 --> 17:59.377
Be too plumb wore out
to hit a lick.

17:59.444 --> 18:02.813
Now, confound it, Arliss, if
you're figurin' out some new...

18:02.881 --> 18:05.049
figurin' out what?

18:07.970 --> 18:10.789
Figurin' out some new way
to make work easier,

18:10.856 --> 18:12.924
Why, that's fine.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.842
And takin' Old Jumper
to drag that brush,

18:14.910 --> 18:17.445
I don't know why
I didn't think of that myself.

18:19.031 --> 18:21.833
Well, come on, Arliss.
Go get 'em.

18:21.984 --> 18:24.585
All right.

18:24.653 --> 18:28.256
I'll bring along an extra rope
to clear away the brush with.

18:28.324 --> 18:31.492
Good idea. That's right
smart thinking, Arliss.

18:59.705 --> 19:02.957
Atta boy, Sam.
Warm up that scent, boy.

19:03.025 --> 19:06.294
Sam's fixin' to pick up
a varmint trail.

19:08.130 --> 19:09.947
<i>Go get him, boy!</i>

19:16.372 --> 19:18.322
nudge him out, boy.

19:23.111 --> 19:25.479
He's in there someplace.

19:25.547 --> 19:28.716
All right, Arliss,
she's tied.

19:28.783 --> 19:30.718
<i>Tote her down.</i>

19:30.786 --> 19:33.120
Stay with it, Sam.
You'll get him directly.

19:33.188 --> 19:35.606
All right, Jumper, giddap.

19:37.059 --> 19:38.859
Come on, Jumper, giddap.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.470
Whoa, Jumper!

19:51.673 --> 19:53.791
Whoa, Jumper!

19:55.610 --> 19:58.012
Dang you, whoa!

20:00.198 --> 20:02.333
Arliss!

20:03.919 --> 20:06.420
You and Jumper sure made
a mess out of that.

20:06.488 --> 20:09.156
What do you mean? He piled the
brush right where you wanted it.

20:12.394 --> 20:14.495
It sounds like
Sam struck a hot one.

20:14.563 --> 20:17.364
Yee-hoo!
Lookie yonder!

20:18.634 --> 20:22.086
Yee-hoo! Go get him, Sam!

20:22.153 --> 20:25.523
Man, oh, man, ain't he makin'
that ol' cat get high behind?

20:25.590 --> 20:27.391
One thing you can say
for old Sam, anytime

20:27.392 --> 20:29.193
he takes to a trail,
he'll hang with it,

20:29.261 --> 20:31.546
Better than any dog
I ever heard tell of.

20:31.614 --> 20:34.415
Come on, Travis. We'll mount up,
and we'll jump her and follow her.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.283
We got work to do,
remember?

20:36.351 --> 20:39.320
But that ol' cat's been raiding the
chicken roost. We gotta catch him.

20:39.387 --> 20:42.790
Sure we do. And when Sam trees
him, we'll go right out and get him.

20:42.858 --> 20:45.893
But, meanwhile, we'll just
keep grubbing brush, right?

20:56.505 --> 21:00.975
Who ever heard tell of workin'
when you could chase a bobcat?

21:01.042 --> 21:03.244
Now, Arliss,
come on back here.

21:09.151 --> 21:12.353
I'll set your britches
to smokin', you hear me?

21:21.463 --> 21:23.932
Travis!

21:23.999 --> 21:27.635
<i>Travis Coates!
Mr. Searcy.</i>

21:35.227 --> 21:38.062
Injuns! Injuns raiding
all over the place!

21:38.129 --> 21:41.449
Get your gun, boy. Get some bullets.
Break out a fresh keg of powder!

21:41.517 --> 21:43.867
Injuns?
Where, at salt licks?

21:43.935 --> 21:46.387
Could be. By now, they're liable to
have wiped out the whole settlement.

21:46.454 --> 21:48.464
Burnin', killin'
scalpin'. Draggin' poor

21:48.465 --> 21:50.474
screamin' women off to
a fate worse than death.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.627
Lisbeth, honey,
would you mind slippin' down?

21:52.694 --> 21:55.896
This poor old pony is gettin'
a mite winded. Yes, Papa.

21:55.964 --> 21:59.149
Well, who saw the Indians,
Mr. Searcy?

21:59.217 --> 22:01.185
Well, I don't know.
Best I could learn...

22:01.253 --> 22:03.787
Is they struck
at loyal valley last night.

22:03.855 --> 22:08.593
Old Wiley crup, he come up with 16
head of horses missin' this mornin'.

22:08.660 --> 22:12.396
What's that I smell
cookin', boy, frijole beans?

22:12.464 --> 22:14.598
But, Mr. Searcy, missing horses
don't have to mean Indians.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.734
Horses can stray.
Not them horses.

22:16.802 --> 22:19.603
Crup says Injuns got 'em.
Told Todd McDougal they did.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.605
But he didn't
set eyes on 'em.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.674
Wiley said it sounded
like Injuns to him,

22:23.675 --> 22:25.676
and you know Wiley
wouldn't tell a lie,

22:25.744 --> 22:27.678
'less maybe there's
a little money involved.

22:27.746 --> 22:30.347
them beans just about done,
ain't they, boy?

22:33.569 --> 22:35.870
What's that dog after,
Injuns?

22:35.937 --> 22:37.872
No. Sam and Arliss
are trailin' a bobcat.

22:37.939 --> 22:41.743
Thunder-ration, boy. Don't
you know no better than that?

22:41.810 --> 22:43.553
Lettin' a helpless
youngun run footloose

22:43.554 --> 22:45.296
through them hills just
swarmin' with savages.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.800
<i>Them red devils are liable to haul
off and scalp that boy any minute.</i>

22:48.867 --> 22:50.802
Eat that dog too,
if you ain't watchin'.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.737
<i>Injuns are partial
to dog eatin'.</i>

22:53.805 --> 22:56.223
If I was you,
I'd go get him,

22:56.291 --> 22:59.159
Before we even bother to set
a foot under that dinner table.

22:59.227 --> 23:01.829
Oh, well, it might not hurt
to go get him.

23:01.897 --> 23:04.398
Yeah, well, you just do that.
You just do that.

23:04.466 --> 23:07.484
Lisbeth, honey, you might ought
to water this poor old pony.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.486
Shuck him out
a few ears of corn too.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.488
Build back his strength
a little. Yes, Papa.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.490
And while you're out there
roundin' up the youngun,

23:13.558 --> 23:16.727
I'll just be neighborly like and
go and look at them beans of yours.

23:16.795 --> 23:19.596
Be a cryin' shame
if they was left to burn.

23:34.913 --> 23:38.249
Tarnation,
them beans is hot!

23:47.676 --> 23:51.495
You know, about them Indians, that's
mostly just scare talk, wasn't it?

23:51.563 --> 23:56.917
Well, you know Papa, always trying
to make things bigger than they are.

23:56.985 --> 24:02.390
Sometimes I wish he wouldn't,
well, you know, go on so much.

24:02.458 --> 24:04.576
Oh, that ain't your
fault. Did you happen

24:04.577 --> 24:06.694
to hear just what
Tom McDougal did say?

24:06.762 --> 24:08.996
Well, now, yes.

24:09.063 --> 24:13.634
What he told Papa was that what Mr.
Crup said if it were ten years ago,

24:13.701 --> 24:16.637
He'd just bet it was Indians
who stole those horses.

24:16.704 --> 24:18.639
Yeah, that's about
what I figured.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.175
It's been a long time
since Apaches come

24:21.176 --> 24:23.644
out of those high
mountains on a raid.

24:23.711 --> 24:25.646
Well.

24:27.615 --> 24:30.684
Still need to
round up Arliss, though.

24:30.752 --> 24:33.187
I'm gonna finish that grubbin'
before sundown.

24:37.743 --> 24:42.346
Um, would... would you care
for a mite of company?

24:43.699 --> 24:45.633
I ain't seen a bobcat
in some time.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.969
Close up, that is.

24:49.304 --> 24:52.507
Well, yeah, sure.
Sure.

25:08.673 --> 25:12.276
Wouldn't hurt none
to hang on to my belt.

25:12.343 --> 25:14.511
Make more sense
than falling off.

25:37.152 --> 25:39.453
Did you hear about Betsy
Miller and George Floyd?

25:39.521 --> 25:42.890
No. What about 'em? Got
married last Thursday.

25:42.958 --> 25:47.227
Got married? I didn't
know they was old enough.

25:47.295 --> 25:50.865
Oh, yes. Betsy's eight
months older than me.

25:50.933 --> 25:54.669
And George, well, he's at least
a few months older than you.

25:54.736 --> 25:57.872
That's more than old enough.
Wouldn't you figure?

25:57.940 --> 25:59.874
Yeah, sounds like.

25:59.942 --> 26:03.978
My Mama and Papa were even
younger when they got married.

26:04.046 --> 26:06.681
is that so?
Oh, yes.

26:06.748 --> 26:09.617
Mama says, "getting
married is the best way...

26:09.684 --> 26:12.353
For two folks to really
get to know each other."

26:12.420 --> 26:15.489
listen.
I think I hear Sam.

26:15.557 --> 26:17.625
He's right over yonder.

26:30.238 --> 26:33.024
Well, I don't hear him now.
Me neither.

26:33.091 --> 26:36.794
Be real quiet.
I wanna listen.

26:36.862 --> 26:39.964
that's Jumper.

26:48.390 --> 26:50.324
There he is.

26:54.679 --> 26:56.347
<i>go get him, Sam!</i>

27:03.505 --> 27:05.739
Arliss,
you come outta there.

27:05.807 --> 27:08.909
Not till we get
this old bobcat, I ain't.

27:12.614 --> 27:14.524
You leave that bobcat
alone. You keep messin'

27:14.525 --> 27:16.434
with him, he's liable
to eat you alive.

27:16.501 --> 27:18.786
He can't. I'm holdin'
him off with a stick.

27:18.854 --> 27:21.321
Listen to him squall
when I poke him.

27:28.547 --> 27:30.897
Pesky Arliss.
Tryin' to reason with him...

27:30.965 --> 27:35.402
<i>Is like buttin' your head up
against a stoop and pole stoke.</i>

27:35.470 --> 27:37.404
I'd better go in
and get him.

27:46.932 --> 27:50.183
Sic him, Sam!
Just kill him!

27:50.251 --> 27:53.070
That'll teach him
to leave our chickens alone.

27:53.138 --> 27:55.106
Arliss,
you get outta there.

27:55.173 --> 27:58.242
Travis, you leave go of me.
Not till I get you out of here.

27:58.309 --> 28:00.911
I ain't comin' out till
I'm darn good and ready.

28:00.979 --> 28:03.214
Well, you get good and ready
'cause you're comin' out.

28:03.281 --> 28:05.616
Oh, no, I ain't!

28:11.489 --> 28:14.125
Ow!
You let go!

28:14.192 --> 28:17.461
Quit kicking me!

28:26.405 --> 28:28.339
Dang you, Travis,
let go!

28:28.407 --> 28:30.541
Come on!

28:32.677 --> 28:34.478
Arliss.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.813
I'll learn you,
Travis Coates.

28:36.881 --> 28:39.367
Ow! Now cut it out!

28:39.434 --> 28:41.635
You stop rockin' Travis,
you hear?

28:41.703 --> 28:44.037
Ow!

28:44.105 --> 28:46.507
Hang on to him.

28:50.812 --> 28:53.314
All right, Arliss. You asked
for it, and you're gonna get it.

28:53.382 --> 28:56.717
Dang you, Travis Coates, when I
get big, I'm gonna fix you good.

28:56.785 --> 28:59.620
<i>Hold it. Hold it!</i>

30:11.259 --> 30:13.493
We better make
a run for it.

30:21.937 --> 30:23.887
Travis!

30:43.224 --> 30:45.392
You leave my brother alone!

31:26.000 --> 31:27.934
Get him, Sam!

31:38.045 --> 31:40.914
Chew on him, Sam.

31:46.955 --> 31:49.122
Murderer!

32:28.363 --> 32:30.530
Uncle Beck!

34:00.622 --> 34:02.322
Yah!

34:06.678 --> 34:09.946
Yah! Yah!

36:00.274 --> 36:02.208
Aah!

36:31.789 --> 36:33.573
Travis!
It's all right.

36:33.641 --> 36:35.575
It's all right. They're
just having fun with him.

37:42.376 --> 37:45.228
Arliss, you gotta quit
fightin' 'em.

37:45.296 --> 37:48.281
That little varmint bothers
me again and I'll kill him.

37:48.349 --> 37:51.217
And get us all killed before we
get a chance to escape. Look out!

37:55.807 --> 37:59.543
You come back here with my hat,
you yellow-bellied coward!

37:59.611 --> 38:02.746
Arliss, quit rilin' him. Next time
he'll be lifting more than your hat.

38:02.813 --> 38:05.482
So wild to get a scalp,
he'd even take it from a baby.

38:05.549 --> 38:08.668
Who you callin' a baby?
-Arliss!

38:08.736 --> 38:11.404
You've got to quit fighting
back, do you hear me?

38:11.472 --> 38:14.207
Yeah, I hear.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.361
That's the one
that killed Sam.

39:08.429 --> 39:11.832
The one what stole
my hat. Killed Sam?

39:11.900 --> 39:14.735
Chopped him down with a chunk of
wood while you were unconscious.

39:14.802 --> 39:16.803
I tell you,
he'll pay for that.

39:16.871 --> 39:19.014
Listen, don't start
anything. You're gonna

39:19.015 --> 39:21.158
mess up any chance we
got of gettin' away.

39:21.225 --> 39:24.061
All right,
but I'll get him.

39:26.881 --> 39:31.234
Travis, what's to happen to us
if we don't escape?

39:31.302 --> 39:33.236
Don't fret, Lisbeth,
we'll get away.

39:33.304 --> 39:35.689
But supposin' we don't,
what then?

39:35.757 --> 39:38.057
Well, it's kinda hard
to figure.

39:38.125 --> 39:41.194
They'll probably make me into one
of their slaves, more than likely.

39:41.262 --> 39:44.731
Oh, no! Only reason I can figure
for them not killing me right off.

39:44.798 --> 39:47.534
Well, I ain't gonna be no
slave, and I'll swear to that.

39:47.602 --> 39:50.870
No, being a youngun, they'll
probably make you an Indian.

39:50.938 --> 39:53.473
I'd like to see 'em try.
I'd just like to see 'em.

39:53.540 --> 39:57.961
You just simmer down. They ain't
gonna make no injun out of me.

39:58.029 --> 40:00.964
Travis?
Yes.

40:01.032 --> 40:03.300
What do you reckon
they figure to do with me?

40:06.670 --> 40:09.339
I ain't really give that
proper thought.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.875
They'll make me some
Indian's squaw, won't they?

40:11.942 --> 40:13.960
Lisbeth.
That one.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.614
He's as much as claimed me,
hasn't he?

40:18.683 --> 40:21.417
Say, maybe that's
the way to do it.

40:22.619 --> 40:24.470
Do what?
Get away.

40:24.538 --> 40:27.557
Let's get some other injun
and that one into a fight...

40:27.625 --> 40:30.393
Over who gets Lisbeth
for his squaw.

40:30.461 --> 40:34.014
<i>And in the fuss, you and me
could make a run for it. Arliss!</i>

40:34.081 --> 40:36.141
Then we can hightail
it outta here and bring

40:36.142 --> 40:38.201
back help. Maybe she
won't be married yet.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.786
Travis!
Hush up!

40:39.854 --> 40:42.471
If they're gonna make her a
squaw anyway, what's the harm?

40:42.539 --> 40:45.208
Arliss, be quiet!

40:45.276 --> 40:49.479
Listen, Lisbeth. Nobody's
gonna touch you. I promise.

40:49.546 --> 40:53.016
But if you try to fight them,
they'll kill you.

40:53.084 --> 40:56.819
I'd rather be dead than see
one of them lay a hand on you.

41:00.408 --> 41:02.558
Mush.

41:19.960 --> 41:23.963
That one your Uncle Beck shot, he's
different from the others, isn't he?

41:24.031 --> 41:28.535
Yeah, he's Comanche. You can tell
by his hair. Others are Apache.

41:28.602 --> 41:32.104
Why does he run instead
of ridin'? Is he crazy?

41:32.172 --> 41:34.307
No, it's easier to run.

41:34.375 --> 41:37.544
Jouncin' around that horse
hurts his wounded leg.

41:37.611 --> 41:41.581
Well, I hope that bullet
wound bleeds him to death.

41:55.279 --> 41:59.199
Look at 'em,
stuffin' their bellies.

42:48.199 --> 42:50.300
This meat tastes funny.

42:50.367 --> 42:52.502
Wonder what it is.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.704
Horse meat,
more than likely.

42:56.673 --> 42:59.225
Horse meat?

42:59.293 --> 43:03.246
Where's Old Jumper?
Probably with the horses.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.784
No, he ain't.
He ain't with the horses.

43:07.852 --> 43:10.720
Travis, they've killed him! They
went and butchered Old Jumper.

43:10.788 --> 43:14.524
Now how do you know?
-I can't see him nowheres.

43:14.591 --> 43:17.961
I can't eat none of Old
Jumper. I tell you, I can't.

43:18.029 --> 43:19.963
You don't know
it's Jumper.

43:20.031 --> 43:21.965
If it ain't him,
where's he at?

43:22.033 --> 43:24.067
Well, he could have
gotten away.

43:24.135 --> 43:26.937
I didn't see him get away. -You
didn't see him get butchered neither.

43:27.004 --> 43:28.838
Now, Arliss, sit there
and eat 'cause you

43:28.839 --> 43:30.673
don't know when you're
gonna get another chance.

43:30.741 --> 43:33.509
But what if it is
Old Jumper?

43:35.112 --> 43:37.780
If it is Old Jumper,
he won't mind.

43:37.849 --> 43:39.782
Jumper will know
you gotta eat.

43:39.851 --> 43:41.784
Sure.

44:04.008 --> 44:05.942
You know,

44:06.010 --> 44:08.111
Jumper was a good ol' mule.

44:09.630 --> 44:12.999
<i>Plowed our corn,
packed in our meat.</i>

44:14.468 --> 44:16.936
Hauled our crops.

44:17.004 --> 44:20.606
Drug up the logs
for the cabin, Papa said.

44:20.674 --> 44:23.777
And now he's keeping us
from starving to death.

44:36.623 --> 44:40.526
Do you remember the time the hogs
cut up you and Old Yeller so bad...

44:40.594 --> 44:43.196
And Jumper had to
bring you in home?

44:46.733 --> 44:49.468
Arliss, could you just
hush up about Old Jumper?

44:52.439 --> 44:55.608
Remember how we used to have
to tie a drag log to his foot...

44:55.676 --> 44:58.411
To keep him from jumpin'
into the corn?

45:00.380 --> 45:02.682
Sure was a good old mule.

45:10.057 --> 45:12.725
Dang their
stinkin' hides.

45:12.793 --> 45:16.162
Somebody's gonna pay
for killin' Old Jumper.

45:16.230 --> 45:19.632
And I know just who.

45:31.345 --> 45:34.697
That oughta teach you something
about butcherin' Old Jumper.

46:15.188 --> 46:17.123
Put me down!

46:21.194 --> 46:23.296
Gimme back my shirt!

46:33.206 --> 46:35.157
What are they doing
to him?

46:35.225 --> 46:37.694
They admire his spirit. Gonna
make an Indian out of him.

47:34.818 --> 47:37.404
Lisbeth.

47:37.471 --> 47:39.406
Lisbeth.

47:42.310 --> 47:45.011
Get my knife
out of my back pocket.

47:51.752 --> 47:53.853
How will
I ever open it?

47:53.921 --> 47:56.423
Bring it up to my mouth.

48:12.940 --> 48:14.874
Shh.

48:27.922 --> 48:30.423
Arliss.

48:30.491 --> 48:32.475
Arliss!

48:32.543 --> 48:36.512
Shh. Be real quiet now.
I'm cutting you loose.

49:31.552 --> 49:33.486
Arliss,
you gone crazy?

49:33.554 --> 49:36.656
I wasn't leavin' without
my pants. Let's git.

49:44.965 --> 49:47.433
Travis, that's Sam.
Sam!

49:51.605 --> 49:53.273
Sam's alive!

49:53.340 --> 49:55.808
Come on.
Look out!

50:08.455 --> 50:12.525
let me go!

50:20.033 --> 50:22.502
You leave him alone!

50:25.806 --> 50:27.807
No!

50:56.236 --> 50:58.704
no! No!

51:14.387 --> 51:17.489
Travis, that's Sam again!

51:17.558 --> 51:21.060
<i>Aah!
-He's on the trail.</i>

51:21.127 --> 51:23.930
Come on, Sam.
Bring Uncle Beck!

52:24.640 --> 52:27.441
Troops, ho!

52:38.771 --> 52:41.289
Travis, look!

52:46.429 --> 52:49.897
Forward, ho!

53:18.961 --> 53:22.830
Wait! Wait!

54:05.074 --> 54:07.842
That's a really
scared bunch of Indians.

54:07.910 --> 54:10.412
Apaches from what
I could see through the dust.

54:10.479 --> 54:13.981
Yeah. Well, there's no use
chasing 'em any farther.

54:14.050 --> 54:16.251
I wonder what devilry
they've been up to.

54:16.318 --> 54:18.719
Horse stealin'
it looks like.

54:18.787 --> 54:21.222
Left by twos. Ho.

54:37.540 --> 54:39.790
Wait!

54:41.193 --> 54:44.462
Wait!

56:00.923 --> 56:02.857
Easy, boy.

56:04.292 --> 56:07.379
Whoa, now.

56:07.446 --> 56:09.797
I won't hurt you now.

56:11.166 --> 56:13.351
Whoa, now.

56:20.526 --> 56:23.895
Hold it now.
Hold it, boy.

56:23.963 --> 56:25.797
Easy.

57:07.772 --> 57:09.707
Sam.

57:11.510 --> 57:14.445
Hey. What's
the matter, Sam?

57:14.513 --> 57:16.680
It's me, Travis.

57:16.748 --> 57:19.434
hey.

57:21.504 --> 57:23.421
Come here,
you old hound, you.

57:23.489 --> 57:25.957
Sure am glad
to see you, boy.

57:33.115 --> 57:35.850
Listen, Sam.

57:35.918 --> 57:39.387
If anything's gonna be done
for Lisbeth and Arliss,

57:39.455 --> 57:42.056
Looks like we gotta do it.

57:45.394 --> 57:48.496
Come on, boy.
Let's pick up that trail.

57:49.715 --> 57:52.217
Hey!
Sam, come here.

57:52.284 --> 57:54.919
Come here, Sam.
Come here.

57:54.986 --> 57:57.321
Sam, now listen.

57:57.389 --> 58:00.124
You gotta hold back
or you'll outrun me.

58:00.192 --> 58:03.795
We gotta work together on this
or we don't stand a chance.

58:05.764 --> 58:08.232
All right,
let's try again.

58:54.830 --> 58:57.665
Sam! Sam! Sam.

58:57.733 --> 59:01.201
Sam, wait.
Sam.

59:01.269 --> 59:03.121
Come back.

59:31.050 --> 59:32.750
Get him off of me!

59:32.818 --> 59:35.987
Travis! Travis.

59:36.055 --> 59:38.489
Quit that. Quit that, boy.

59:38.557 --> 59:40.658
Travis!
Take it easy now.

59:40.726 --> 59:42.760
Easy. Easy, Travis.
You settle down now.

59:42.828 --> 59:44.929
Take it easy.
Settle down now.

59:44.996 --> 59:47.031
Travis. Travis.

59:48.967 --> 59:51.252
Uncle Beck.

59:52.104 --> 59:54.455
Easy now.
Easy, Travis.

59:54.523 --> 59:56.524
We're with you now.

59:56.592 --> 01:00:00.344
Gosh doggone it. Tried...
tried to choke a man to death.

01:00:00.412 --> 01:00:02.880
well, get him
some water, crup.

01:00:02.948 --> 01:00:05.533
Lisbeth, my baby girl,
is she all right?

01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:08.235
What about Arliss?

01:00:08.303 --> 01:00:11.939
Back's bad sunburned.
Them bruises look ugly too.

01:00:12.007 --> 01:00:15.710
Best grease 'em. Todd, get that bacon
rind out of my saddlebag. Here, son.

01:00:15.777 --> 01:00:18.045
I have a clean shirt
in my saddlebag.

01:00:19.982 --> 01:00:23.383
Here. Easy. Easy now. -You kill
any of them cutthroat savages?

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:27.588
<i>they still got my horses?</i>

01:00:27.656 --> 01:00:32.193
Them thievin' devils.
-Sam. We gotta get Sam!

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:36.814
Sam? He got a hot
trail on them Indians.

01:00:36.882 --> 01:00:38.649
We gotta catch up
with that dog before

01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:40.417
it gets dark. You
think you can make it?

01:00:40.485 --> 01:00:41.944
He's gotta make it.
I tell you, them red

01:00:41.945 --> 01:00:43.404
devils so much as
touch my little girl...

01:00:43.472 --> 01:00:48.058
Of course I can make it. -Let's go
then. You can eat while we're riding.

01:00:48.126 --> 01:00:53.114
Now hold on a minute, Beck.
We got a little problem here.

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:56.184
Seven men
and six horses.

01:00:56.251 --> 01:00:58.552
Ride double.

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:02.673
Why, it's gonna be tough enough of
keepin' up with that dog ridin' single.

01:01:02.741 --> 01:01:06.544
And I say let's leave the boy here
and we'll pick him up on the way back.

01:01:06.612 --> 01:01:09.413
I'm goin'.
Now lookie here, boy.

01:01:09.481 --> 01:01:12.349
I won't hold nobody up.
I'll take it afoot. Afoot?

01:01:12.417 --> 01:01:16.788
Sure, I'll run alongside and hang onto
somebody's saddle, like the Comanche.

01:01:16.855 --> 01:01:19.924
Comanche? I thought
you said them was Apaches.

01:01:19.992 --> 01:01:22.102
They are Apache,
all but one. -Whoever

01:01:22.103 --> 01:01:24.212
heard of a Comanche
runnin' with Apache?

01:01:24.279 --> 01:01:26.997
What difference does it make? Our
job's to find 'em. Beck's right.

01:01:27.065 --> 01:01:30.218
Find 'em and kill 'em.

01:01:30.285 --> 01:01:32.770
You say that Comanche kept up
hanging on the saddle? Yes, sir.

01:01:32.837 --> 01:01:34.972
Well, if he can do it,
so can we.

01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:38.476
Get up on that horse and finish
eatin'. I'll take the first turn.

01:01:38.543 --> 01:01:40.578
If we don't catch up
with them before they get

01:01:40.579 --> 01:01:42.613
to the mountains we're
never gonna find 'em.

01:01:53.408 --> 01:01:56.844
Wiley, uh, I could use
a chaw myself.

01:02:01.183 --> 01:02:03.133
Come on.

01:02:37.586 --> 01:02:39.620
all right, who's next?

01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:45.359
<i>I believe I am, Beck.
no, you ain't.</i>

01:02:45.427 --> 01:02:49.947
Yeah, it's your turn. Bud Searcy
here's the only one that ain't run yet.

01:02:50.015 --> 01:02:51.949
Well, is that a fact?

01:02:52.017 --> 01:02:55.619
I reckon I lost count.
You mind totin' this for me?

01:03:00.692 --> 01:03:03.477
This old gun ain't
no good, Searcy. An

01:03:03.478 --> 01:03:06.263
old pony'd get swayback
just a packin' it.

01:03:06.331 --> 01:03:10.284
No good? Did I ever tell about the time
I blew a hole through two savages...

01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:13.120
Ridin' side by side
a thousand yards away?

01:03:13.187 --> 01:03:16.374
never did see two more
surprised Injuns, till today.

01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:19.126
Not to mention the buffalo
a-runnin' alongside 'em.

01:03:19.193 --> 01:03:22.113
Come on, bud.
-Beck, he's too old to run.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:26.116
Who's too old? Happen to know I'm
eight year younger than pack underwood.

01:03:26.184 --> 01:03:29.854
Yeah. Eight years younger
and a hundred pounds heavier.

01:03:29.921 --> 01:03:34.992
Why, 50 yards on foot and your eyeballs
would be a-stickin' out on their stems.

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:38.362
Crup, if he wants to run,
let him run. Now let's git.

01:03:38.429 --> 01:03:42.116
Too old. Did I ever tell you about
the time I run a deer down on foot?

01:03:42.183 --> 01:03:45.235
Save your wind, Searcy.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:04.288
Look at that.

01:04:06.341 --> 01:04:08.976
Could be Sam.

01:04:29.814 --> 01:04:33.834
<i>Uncle Beck, it's Sam! -All right,
hold it. Hold it. No shootin'.</i>

01:04:33.901 --> 01:04:36.870
Beat 'em off
with your ropes.

01:04:44.596 --> 01:04:46.764
Hyah! Hyah!

01:04:46.831 --> 01:04:50.067
Get out of here! Hyah!
Hyah! Get out of there!

01:04:50.135 --> 01:04:54.521
Hyah! Hyah! Go
on! Get up! Get up!

01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:57.558
Hyah! Hyah!
Go on! Get out of here!

01:04:57.626 --> 01:05:00.294
Get! Get up there!
Get up!

01:05:05.784 --> 01:05:09.053
Easy, boy.
Good old Sam.

01:05:09.121 --> 01:05:11.789
Let me see what
they did to you.

01:05:11.857 --> 01:05:14.458
Cut him up much?

01:05:14.525 --> 01:05:17.527
Well, they chewed up
his paw pretty bad. Oh.

01:05:17.595 --> 01:05:20.131
Think he can
take the trail?

01:05:21.733 --> 01:05:23.667
I don't know.

01:05:26.138 --> 01:05:28.438
Try him.

01:05:31.977 --> 01:05:35.512
All right, Sam.
Come here, boy.

01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:41.285
Come here, boy.
Come to me.

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:47.491
Come on, Sam.

01:05:53.498 --> 01:05:55.549
What are we gonna
do now, Beck?

01:05:55.617 --> 01:05:57.885
I say leave him here
and let's get to ridin'.

01:05:57.953 --> 01:06:01.488
The trail's gonna be tougher to follow
from here on, especially at night.

01:06:01.556 --> 01:06:03.991
Without that dog
we ain't got a prayer.

01:06:05.326 --> 01:06:08.029
But that hound
can't even walk.

01:06:08.096 --> 01:06:10.264
Hand him up here, Travis.

01:06:10.331 --> 01:06:13.483
Wiley crup, you done
that on purpose.

01:06:13.551 --> 01:06:16.754
Ah, quit your "bellerin'." Searcy,
a good bath never hurt you none.

01:06:24.629 --> 01:06:27.298
Man, now I guess
I seen everything.

01:06:27.366 --> 01:06:32.203
Blowhards and pot hounds allowed to
ride while good men are left afoot.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.826
All right, who runs now?
-Reckon I do.

01:06:40.678 --> 01:06:43.447
You reckon you can?
-Sure.

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:49.170
Let's git.

01:07:20.485 --> 01:07:23.087
Travis.
Yes, sir?

01:07:24.722 --> 01:07:27.858
Take Sam down and see
if he can pick up the trail.

01:07:28.994 --> 01:07:32.662
Supposin' he can't?
He will.

01:07:47.112 --> 01:07:49.113
Go, Sam.

01:08:08.716 --> 01:08:10.650
Please, Sam.

01:08:12.453 --> 01:08:14.722
Arliss, Sam.

01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:16.807
Go find Arliss.

01:08:23.348 --> 01:08:25.916
Come on, Sam.

01:08:38.046 --> 01:08:41.014
That's it, Sam!
-Stick with it, Sam.

01:08:42.901 --> 01:08:45.252
Travis, go on,
pick him up.

01:08:46.821 --> 01:08:48.856
We're on the right trail.

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:52.225
What'd I tell ya?

01:08:52.292 --> 01:08:56.930
still say we're puttin' a heap
of Faith in a lame dog.

01:08:56.997 --> 01:08:59.600
Right now a lame dog's
all we got.

01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:11.645
Don't tell me
about right and wrong.

01:09:11.712 --> 01:09:14.098
I'm not trying to
tell you anything, pack.

01:09:14.166 --> 01:09:16.366
Then don't argue with me
about injun killing.

01:09:16.434 --> 01:09:19.352
I wasn't arguing. I merely said the
reason the Indians fight so hard...

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:22.389
Is the white man's crowding
in, killing off the buffalo.

01:09:22.457 --> 01:09:26.259
That's all. Them Injuns don't own
the land, they don't own the buffalo.

01:09:26.327 --> 01:09:28.462
Maybe not, but after
thousands of years

01:09:28.462 --> 01:09:30.596
they feel as though
they have a right to it.

01:09:30.665 --> 01:09:33.066
They're gonna learn different.

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:35.736
And I learn 'em.

01:09:37.906 --> 01:09:40.908
Sometimes hard to tell
who the savages are.

01:09:40.975 --> 01:09:43.010
Dirty injun lover!

01:09:46.598 --> 01:09:49.316
Quit that!
Quit it out, I said!

01:09:49.383 --> 01:09:51.652
Quit that! He can't
talk to me that way!

01:09:51.719 --> 01:09:54.054
I said, quit it. We
go fightin' amongst

01:09:54.055 --> 01:09:56.389
ourselves, we're never
gonna catch no Injuns.

01:10:03.097 --> 01:10:06.450
Travis, you spell
crup a while.

01:10:06.517 --> 01:10:10.821
It's about time. My feets wore
off clean up to the hipbone.

01:10:14.759 --> 01:10:17.127
I didn't mean
to get him so upset.

01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:20.964
I know that.

01:10:21.032 --> 01:10:23.783
I never saw a man
so full of hate.

01:10:23.851 --> 01:10:27.370
Well, there's things that can
sometimes breed hate in a man.

01:10:27.438 --> 01:10:29.540
Not like that.

01:10:31.109 --> 01:10:33.376
You're new out here, white.

01:10:33.444 --> 01:10:36.780
You're gonna find
this is a hard country.

01:10:36.848 --> 01:10:41.785
You go to fightin' it, and it fights
you right back every inch of the way.

01:10:41.853 --> 01:10:44.405
Ain't Virginia.
I realize that, Beck.

01:10:45.490 --> 01:10:47.424
I mean, out here...

01:10:47.492 --> 01:10:50.761
A man puts in
a crop of corn and...

01:10:50.829 --> 01:10:53.730
You bust your back
watering it and hoeing it,

01:10:53.798 --> 01:10:56.901
And just before harvest
it gets set on by hoppers.

01:10:56.968 --> 01:10:59.302
They hate the land.

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:02.405
And you got about 50 head
of cattle ready for market.

01:11:02.474 --> 01:11:04.875
Then blight comes
along and kills 'em

01:11:04.876 --> 01:11:07.277
all off. You get so
you hate everythin'.

01:11:07.345 --> 01:11:09.612
But not other people
the way he does.

01:11:12.333 --> 01:11:15.702
Look, a couple of years ago,
pack come home...

01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:19.172
He come one day and he found
his cabin burnt to the ground...

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.108
And his wife
and three kids was killed.

01:11:21.176 --> 01:11:23.844
All of 'em was scalped.

01:11:24.562 --> 01:11:27.648
And he about went crazy
grievin'.

01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:30.016
That can turn into hate
real easy.

01:11:34.305 --> 01:11:36.506
Come on, Sam.

01:11:36.574 --> 01:11:38.575
That's a boy.

01:11:41.212 --> 01:11:45.282
I just thought you
ought to know. Come on.

01:11:45.349 --> 01:11:47.751
all right, let's go.

01:12:25.473 --> 01:12:27.841
Look it.

01:12:27.908 --> 01:12:31.028
They buried that fire and let out
in a hurry. -How long do you figure?

01:12:31.096 --> 01:12:33.463
It couldn't be long.
The sand's still warm.

01:12:33.531 --> 01:12:36.817
If we're that close behind them red
devils, now's the time to crowd in.

01:12:36.884 --> 01:12:39.686
That's what we're gonna do.
Travis, go get Sam.

01:12:39.753 --> 01:12:41.705
Come here, Sam.

01:12:43.007 --> 01:12:47.227
<i>Whose turn is it to run?
-It's mine, Beck.</i>

01:13:02.677 --> 01:13:07.013
Notice how many snakes and
spiders are movin' about? Yeah.

01:13:07.081 --> 01:13:08.898
Come on. Let's go.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.925
If it wasn't the
middle of the day, I'd

01:13:34.926 --> 01:13:37.210
say those birds are
heading for their roost.

01:13:37.278 --> 01:13:39.345
They are.
It's fixin' to rain.

01:13:40.648 --> 01:13:44.250
Are you sure?
Look it there.

01:13:44.318 --> 01:13:47.921
Any time you see one of them
old boys on the prowl...

01:13:47.988 --> 01:13:51.124
This far from water,
you can bet it's gonna rain.

01:13:51.192 --> 01:13:55.562
Well, if it rains,
what happens to the trail?

01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:57.898
We'll worry about that
when it rains.

01:15:01.062 --> 01:15:03.846
That's hail!
Crop 'em up behind Todd.

01:15:05.533 --> 01:15:07.684
Head for them rocks!

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:31.441
Head for that cave!

01:15:54.515 --> 01:15:58.251
This ain't the safest place in the
world, but it's better than nothin'.

01:15:58.319 --> 01:16:01.021
Not much. If a ten-foot
head of water come

01:16:01.022 --> 01:16:03.723
a boilin' down out
of them hills yonder,

01:16:03.791 --> 01:16:05.859
It'll drown every
last one of us afore

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:07.927
we get a chance to
turn around and spit.

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:12.299
Wiley, if you knows of a better
place, why don't you go crawl into it?

01:16:54.808 --> 01:16:57.344
We ain't through yet,
Travis.

01:16:57.412 --> 01:17:00.246
How could Lisbeth and
Arliss live through all this?

01:17:00.314 --> 01:17:04.851
Ah, them Indians can find shelter, you
can bet on that. That's right, Travis.

01:17:04.919 --> 01:17:07.654
They're a lot wilder, know
more about the country than us.

01:17:07.722 --> 01:17:11.090
Sure. But the trail will
be completely wiped out.

01:17:11.158 --> 01:17:13.626
We know they're
headed right for them

01:17:13.627 --> 01:17:16.095
mountains, and Sam can
pick up the trail again.

01:17:16.163 --> 01:17:18.214
Man alive, Coates.
Pickin' up a trail

01:17:18.215 --> 01:17:20.266
after a Storm like
that might take days.

01:17:20.334 --> 01:17:22.944
I'll worry about that,
crup. -How long you

01:17:22.945 --> 01:17:25.555
figure these old wore-out
horses gonna last?

01:17:25.623 --> 01:17:28.408
Till they go down.
Then what?

01:17:28.476 --> 01:17:30.944
Then we're gonna
take out afoot.

01:17:31.011 --> 01:17:33.380
Afoot?
-That's what I said.

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:35.915
Well, if that's your plan
you can count me out.

01:17:40.371 --> 01:17:42.772
Figure on goin' home,
you can walk.

01:17:44.458 --> 01:17:48.661
Try and take my horse? -I
wouldn't try it. I'd just take it.

01:17:48.729 --> 01:17:52.032
Coates,

01:17:52.099 --> 01:17:54.734
I rode in here
on my horse.

01:17:54.802 --> 01:17:58.271
I aim to ride out on him
anytime I please.

01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:02.008
So don't nobody
try and stop me.

01:18:03.244 --> 01:18:06.379
Wiley, you damn move
a hair...

01:18:06.447 --> 01:18:09.715
And I'll be obliged to blow a
hole clean through your backbone.

01:18:09.783 --> 01:18:12.302
And this close
that ain't no brag.

01:18:17.508 --> 01:18:19.509
You ain't got the gall.

01:18:19.576 --> 01:18:24.014
Gentlemen, would you kindly
step out from behind Mr. Crup?

01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:28.851
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:18:28.919 --> 01:18:32.655
Now, Wiley, would you care
to test my gall?

01:18:40.915 --> 01:18:42.983
That's better.

01:18:46.821 --> 01:18:50.090
It stopped!
-Well, let's get movin'.

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:52.625
What are we gonna do
about crup? Nothin'.

01:18:52.693 --> 01:18:56.763
Aren't we gonna take his guns? He
can't fight Indians without a gun.

01:18:58.833 --> 01:19:01.434
You old jackass, you.

01:19:09.961 --> 01:19:12.562
Wiley, I could use a chaw.

01:19:14.799 --> 01:19:18.001
Wiley, I'm askin' you
to do me a favor.

01:19:18.069 --> 01:19:21.004
I want you to loan me
a chaw of tobacco.

01:19:23.641 --> 01:19:26.109
thanks.

01:20:23.517 --> 01:20:26.102
Uncle Beck,
wait!

01:20:26.169 --> 01:20:29.789
go get 'em, Sam.
Hunt it out, boy.

01:20:29.857 --> 01:20:32.859
<i>It's all up to you now.</i>

01:20:32.927 --> 01:20:34.978
Do you think he's got
it? -I know he's got it.

01:20:34.979 --> 01:20:37.030
Stay with it, boy.
Stay with it.

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:39.499
<i>come on in. He's got it!</i>

01:20:59.119 --> 01:21:01.087
Uncle Beck.

01:21:04.324 --> 01:21:06.626
Uncle Beck,
we're gettin' close.

01:21:06.693 --> 01:21:09.495
You sure? Yes,
sir. I'm real sure.

01:21:09.563 --> 01:21:12.782
<i>Sam. Sam.
Here, boy. Sam!</i>

01:21:12.850 --> 01:21:16.235
He's liable to run right into
them Injuns. Y'all wait here.

01:21:17.672 --> 01:21:20.490
Wait? I came to kill Injuns,
not to wait.

01:21:20.558 --> 01:21:24.828
Beck said to wait.
Now I reckon we best do it.

01:21:27.782 --> 01:21:29.565
Sam!

01:21:41.846 --> 01:21:44.664
Here, Sam. Sam.
Come here.

01:21:44.731 --> 01:21:48.234
Come here, Sam. Come here,
you. Hold it. Hold it.

01:21:48.302 --> 01:21:51.371
Now quit that.
Quit it, Sam.

01:21:51.438 --> 01:21:54.357
You bite me, I'm gonna
bite you right back, you fool.

01:21:54.425 --> 01:21:57.711
okay.

01:21:57.778 --> 01:21:59.946
You get your mind set
on one thing, you're

01:21:59.947 --> 01:22:02.115
stubborn as a one-eyed
mule, ain't ya?

01:22:02.182 --> 01:22:06.620
All right. Let's see what's
on the other side of that hill.

01:23:04.961 --> 01:23:06.662
Travis.

01:23:08.765 --> 01:23:11.701
You'll be needin'
some extra cartridges.

01:23:13.871 --> 01:23:15.805
Thank you.

01:23:23.848 --> 01:23:26.433
Did you see 'em? In the
draw, back of that hill.

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:29.835
Well, let's go. Now
wait. Now just wait!

01:23:32.723 --> 01:23:34.740
You wait and listen.

01:23:38.679 --> 01:23:40.946
They're fixin' to split up.

01:23:41.014 --> 01:23:44.734
The only chance we got is to keep
'em from gettin' to their horses.

01:23:44.802 --> 01:23:48.555
So I'm gonna ride in and
try and stampede their herd.

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:52.008
Y'all cover me.
Ya understand? Travis.

01:23:52.076 --> 01:23:56.212
You take Sam and tie him up. Put a
muzzle on him so he can't give us away.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.665
Yes, sir.

01:23:58.732 --> 01:24:02.485
White, you and Todd
circle that ridge.

01:24:02.552 --> 01:24:04.971
<i>Come up behind 'em.</i>

01:24:05.038 --> 01:24:06.681
Now, I'm countin'
on the two of you to

01:24:06.682 --> 01:24:08.324
keep 'em from gettin'
up to them mountains.

01:24:08.392 --> 01:24:10.710
Hold your fire until
you see me come into

01:24:10.711 --> 01:24:13.029
that valley because
we got to surprise 'em.

01:24:13.096 --> 01:24:18.251
Crup, you and bud take cover
down at the mouth of that draw.

01:24:18.318 --> 01:24:20.986
That way you can keep 'em from gettin'
out into the open country again.

01:24:21.054 --> 01:24:24.023
Once the shootin' starts, we'll
catch 'em in a cross fire. Now, go on.

01:24:24.090 --> 01:24:26.025
Come on, Bud.
Let's go.

01:24:26.092 --> 01:24:28.494
And where do I go?

01:24:29.646 --> 01:24:31.580
You stick with me, pack.

01:24:35.335 --> 01:24:37.270
Get up here.

01:24:44.678 --> 01:24:46.779
Boy, Sam sure hates
bein' left out.

01:24:50.083 --> 01:24:52.168
Well, he done his part.

01:24:52.236 --> 01:24:56.105
The rest of it's
up to us now. Come on.

01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:15.324
We'll belly crawl from here.

01:25:22.015 --> 01:25:26.919
Now, look, Travis. When this
thing opens up, it's gonna go fast.

01:25:26.987 --> 01:25:31.574
So you gotta be ready for anything and
everything. Ya understand? Yes, sir.

01:25:31.641 --> 01:25:36.195
Now, remember one thing. We're out
here to get Arliss and Lisbeth back.

01:25:36.263 --> 01:25:39.732
If we got to kill some Indians to
do it, that's the way it's gonna be.

01:25:44.338 --> 01:25:50.043
Now, when you go into a fight, there
ain't but one thing you can bet on.

01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:53.145
That's you're gonna be scared.

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:55.448
You feel that way too?

01:25:57.067 --> 01:26:00.269
Man and boy,
it's all the same.

01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:46.733
They're fightin'
over Lisbeth.

01:26:55.909 --> 01:26:59.762
Dirty red savages. Hold
it. Hold, hold it, pack.

01:26:59.830 --> 01:27:02.231
Let 'em get good and caught up
in their fightin'.

01:27:02.298 --> 01:27:04.767
It'll give me a better chance
to stampede their horses.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.004
Stick 'im!
Stick 'im!

01:27:41.855 --> 01:27:44.123
There's my little girl.

01:27:44.191 --> 01:27:47.993
Hold it! Hold it! You heard what
Beck said. What you waitin' for?

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:01.424
I'm gonna ride in now.
Y'all give me cover.

01:28:08.465 --> 01:28:11.400
You dirty,
murderin' savages.

01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:15.671
You dirty, murderin'
savages! No!

01:28:50.824 --> 01:28:53.009
Travis!

01:29:45.012 --> 01:29:47.279
Look out!

01:29:58.208 --> 01:30:01.510
Hyah!

01:30:28.855 --> 01:30:30.790
Uncle Beck!

01:30:46.123 --> 01:30:49.241
I got him, Uncle Beck!
I got him!

01:31:12.282 --> 01:31:16.118
You yellow-bellied varmint,
I'll fix you!

01:31:18.021 --> 01:31:21.690
Who's gonna help you now,
you skinny little Apache?

01:31:32.018 --> 01:31:34.219
Get him, Sam!

01:31:41.811 --> 01:31:44.913
Lisbeth!
-Papa!

01:31:49.636 --> 01:31:53.372
Shoot him.
Shoot him.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.908
Shoot him.
Shoot him!

01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:26.472
He's out of our range, but
that old cannon might reach him.

01:32:26.539 --> 01:32:28.891
Give me it!
Let go.

01:32:28.958 --> 01:32:30.993
Give me it!
Let go!

01:32:40.203 --> 01:32:43.622
Shoot. Shoot.

01:32:50.747 --> 01:32:54.350
Ya did it. Ya did it!

01:32:54.417 --> 01:32:57.085
Man alive, what a shot!

01:32:59.272 --> 01:33:02.991
Yeah. We'll never hear
the end of this.

01:33:21.711 --> 01:33:23.645
Oh, Travis!

01:34:11.978 --> 01:34:14.897
Chase him clean
out of Texas, Sam!

01:34:24.507 --> 01:34:27.476
Arliss!
Uncle Beck!

01:34:27.543 --> 01:34:29.578
Sam!

01:34:29.645 --> 01:34:31.463
Here, Sam!

01:34:33.266 --> 01:34:35.200
Come on, boy.

01:34:42.275 --> 01:34:45.944
Did you see us fightin', me
and that old injun? I sure did.

01:34:46.012 --> 01:34:47.996
Boy, we done that injun
under, didn't we?

01:34:48.064 --> 01:34:50.799
Well, you had a lot
of practice on your brother.

01:34:50.867 --> 01:34:53.619
We sure cleaned
his plows good.

01:34:55.655 --> 01:34:57.540
All the time I was
worryin' about you, I

01:34:57.541 --> 01:34:59.425
should've been worryin'
about them Injuns.

01:34:59.492 --> 01:35:02.228
Come on up here.

01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:09.335
Come on, Sam.

01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:17.759
Papa?

01:35:17.827 --> 01:35:21.230
Papa, please open up
your eyes. G. Searcy?

01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:26.819
<i>What's the matter with Bud?
-Mr. Crup, the water, please.</i>

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:30.322
It's a-comin'.
It's a-comin'.

01:35:33.426 --> 01:35:37.012
What's wrong with him?
Dead, most likely.

01:35:37.079 --> 01:35:39.031
Arliss.
Papa, please wake up.

01:35:39.098 --> 01:35:43.869
His pulse seems all right. -Ah,
they ain't nothin' wrong with him.

01:35:44.888 --> 01:35:47.523
Mr. Crup!
What happened?

01:35:47.591 --> 01:35:52.360
You made that brag shot, and then
you keeled over, you old fake.

01:35:52.428 --> 01:35:54.947
From hunger.

01:35:55.015 --> 01:35:58.817
Weren't nice of you pourin'
that water on me, crup.

01:35:58.885 --> 01:36:03.288
Boy, you'll never live this
down. Two baths in one year.

01:36:03.356 --> 01:36:06.041
Papa, are you all right?

01:36:06.109 --> 01:36:08.911
A mite feverish.
Tell you what, honey.

01:36:08.979 --> 01:36:13.649
Why don't you start up a fire and
cook your Papa up some hot grub?

01:36:13.716 --> 01:36:15.401
Bud, we ain't got
time for that. We gotta

01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:17.086
round up them horses
and get on home.

01:36:17.154 --> 01:36:18.887
come on, Sam.

01:36:21.458 --> 01:36:25.411
What about the rest of them hostiles
out there playin' dead in the grass?

01:36:25.478 --> 01:36:28.514
Pack, we got Arliss and Lisbeth.
That's all we come out here for.

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:31.883
I ain't leavin' till I make sure
every one of them savages is dead.

01:36:31.951 --> 01:36:34.837
Well, you're gonna have to
kill 'em all by yourself,

01:36:34.905 --> 01:36:37.072
'cause the rest of us
goin' home.

01:36:58.545 --> 01:37:02.814
Anytime you feel strong enough to
ride by yourself, you just say so.

01:37:02.882 --> 01:37:07.286
Oh, yes, Travis. Just as soon as I
feel strong enough, I'll let you know.

01:37:10.857 --> 01:37:14.243
Crup, did you see how
steady-handed I was...

01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:16.278
When I lifted
my trusty old 55 and...

01:37:16.346 --> 01:37:20.549
Bud, I seen how lucky you was, and
I don't wanna hear no more about it.

01:37:22.318 --> 01:37:24.253
Mr. White.

01:37:27.808 --> 01:37:30.042
Mr. White, I bet down
in Virginia,

01:37:30.109 --> 01:37:32.812
You never did see a shot like
the one I put through that injun.

01:37:32.879 --> 01:37:36.615
'course it weren't nothin'
unusual. There were a time once I...

01:37:36.683 --> 01:37:39.952
Excuse me, Mr. Searcy.
I believe Beck needs me.

01:37:49.295 --> 01:37:52.764
Hello, little Arliss.
Well, hi, Mr. Searcy.

01:37:52.832 --> 01:37:57.102
Well, boy, I guess you must be
powerful grateful to me.

01:37:57.169 --> 01:38:01.273
I run halfway across Texas on foot
just to save you and my little girl.

01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:05.945
Oh. G. Searcy, did you see me and
old Sam when we took on that injun?

01:38:06.012 --> 01:38:09.414
No, I didn't. But I don't reckon you
was watchin' when I made that shot?

01:38:09.482 --> 01:38:12.284
Well, no, I wasn't.
But let me tell you.

01:38:12.352 --> 01:38:16.288
I busted him with some rocks,
and then Sam, he nailed him good.

01:38:16.356 --> 01:38:18.924
And afore we got through
with that poor old injun,

01:38:18.992 --> 01:38:22.478
I'll bet he wishes he never even
thought of runnin' off with me.

01:38:22.545 --> 01:38:26.948
Now look, Arliss. It don't seem
proper for a boy to brag on hisself.

01:38:27.016 --> 01:38:29.184
Why, this ain't no brag,
Mr. Searcy.

01:38:29.252 --> 01:38:32.488
Every word I'm about to
tell you is the gospel truth.

01:38:32.555 --> 01:38:36.525
You see, the day we was caught,
Travis and Lisbeth was scared,

01:38:36.593 --> 01:38:38.510
And Sam, he was hurt.

01:38:38.578 --> 01:38:42.080
So I had to start out fightin'
them Injuns all by myself.

01:38:42.148 --> 01:38:46.768
There was one injun took a particular
dislikin' to me right from the start,

01:38:46.836 --> 01:38:49.671
So I knew I had to
fix him proper.

01:38:49.739 --> 01:38:53.242
See, I had this little plan
right up here in my head,

01:38:53.309 --> 01:38:55.544
And one day
when he wasn't lookin',

01:38:55.612 --> 01:38:59.147
Why, I got me a club and I
busted it right over his head.

01:38:59.215 --> 01:39:01.583
Then dang them, they
threw me right in a

01:39:01.584 --> 01:39:03.952
pond, but I fought
'em off just the same.

01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:07.289
You know, I never will forget the
day they killed and ate Old Jumper.

01:39:07.357 --> 01:39:09.492
I picked me up a tree
branch and clubbed the

01:39:09.493 --> 01:39:11.627
injun right over the
head and laid him low.

01:39:11.695 --> 01:39:14.797
Then danged if I didn't have to
fight off half a dozen of 'em.

01:39:14.864 --> 01:39:17.465
I'd have licked 'em too
if one of them hadn't...

01:39:17.533 --> 01:39:19.851
Sure you don't wanna come
to the ranch and get some grub?

01:39:19.919 --> 01:39:23.588
Nope, I'll just be helpin' crup
drive those horses back to his place.

01:39:23.656 --> 01:39:27.559
Then I'll be for wantin'
to get back home. I reckon.

01:39:28.828 --> 01:39:32.797
Well, uh, you tell the rest
of 'em I'm beholden.

01:39:32.865 --> 01:39:35.484
It was just somethin'
that had to be done.

01:39:56.039 --> 01:39:58.474
It was then and there
they decided to make

01:39:58.475 --> 01:40:00.909
an injun out of me,
'cause of my bravery.

01:40:00.977 --> 01:40:05.080
And I'll tell you somethin' else, Mr.
Searcy... I can't wait to hear it, boy.

01:40:05.148 --> 01:40:08.250
I was just gettin' ready to escape
when Uncle Beck come down that hill...

01:40:08.318 --> 01:40:10.602
Just a rippin'
and a tearin'.

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:17.726
Thought we'd never see this place
again. It looks good, don't it?

01:40:17.793 --> 01:40:20.662
Well, bud, you wanna come in
and have a little bite to eat?

01:40:20.730 --> 01:40:24.466
I think I better. I'm hungry,
and my ears plumb wore out.

01:40:24.534 --> 01:40:27.335
I'll finish my story
later, Mr. Searcy.

01:40:27.404 --> 01:40:31.673
It do got a finish, don't it? Yes, sir.
I was savin' the best part for last.

01:40:36.729 --> 01:40:38.797
Jumper!

01:40:43.719 --> 01:40:46.454
Jumper, you're alive!
We didn't eat you after all.

01:40:48.708 --> 01:40:50.992
I'm so glad.

01:40:51.061 --> 01:40:55.264
You don't know how I missed ya
or how happy I am to see ya.

01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:02.137
How many times do I gotta tell you
to keep out of this here corn patch?

01:41:02.205 --> 01:41:05.406
Now get, you ornery mule!

01:41:11.464 --> 01:41:13.782
Dang mule!

01:41:16.686 --> 01:41:18.703
let me help you down.

01:41:20.690 --> 01:41:22.758
Thank you.

01:41:27.213 --> 01:41:30.616
Well, I guess I better
go fix some grub.

01:41:32.318 --> 01:41:34.786
No, Travis.
Cookin' is woman's work.

01:41:34.854 --> 01:41:37.089
You go fetch some wood.

01:41:41.677 --> 01:41:44.379
He's clean hooked, Bud. She's
planted his corn for good.

01:41:44.447 --> 01:41:46.381
Yeah. Funny thing,

01:41:46.449 --> 01:41:49.551
I never could learn for sure what
my little Lisbeth liked in him.

01:41:49.618 --> 01:41:52.187
Must've asked her a thousand
times. She never let me know.

01:41:52.255 --> 01:41:56.224
But now I can see for myself. He
must put her in mind of me. You?

01:41:56.292 --> 01:41:58.226
When I was his age.
Oh.

01:41:58.294 --> 01:42:00.662
'course I've never been "tooken" by
them Injuns. Much too smart for that.

01:42:00.729 --> 01:42:04.099
You was better lookin' too?
Well, not much. Maybe a mite.

01:42:04.167 --> 01:42:06.201
But I was a much better
horseman and marksman

01:42:06.202 --> 01:42:08.236
as you can plainly see
from that shot I made.

01:42:08.304 --> 01:42:10.522
<i>Yeah, that was dandy.</i>

01:42:15.695 --> 01:42:18.246
Stay with him, boy!

01:42:19.699 --> 01:42:22.785
Arliss. Arliss!

01:42:25.071 --> 01:42:27.773
Arliss. Arliss!

01:42:31.945 --> 01:42:34.413
He's quite a boy.

01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:38.583
Yep. Kind of reminds me
of me when I was a boy.

01:42:44.290 --> 01:42:48.677
Sam! Go get him, Sam!
Nail him, boy. You got him!

01:42:53.682 --> 01:42:56.234
Go get him, Sam!
Eat him up!

01:42:58.337 --> 01:43:00.622
Get him, Sam!
Eat him up, boy!

01:43:09.265 --> 01:43:13.351
we were born in the west
in the land that's best

01:43:13.419 --> 01:43:17.155
but folks out here
never get much rest

01:43:17.222 --> 01:43:20.659
with dogs
and boys like me

01:43:20.726 --> 01:43:22.644
in the land

01:43:22.712 --> 01:43:28.183
of the wild country

01:43:34.418 --> 01:43:36.183
