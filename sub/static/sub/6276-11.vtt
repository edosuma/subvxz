and brightest.

13:23.166 --> 13:24.750
And don't fucking ignore me.

13:24.834 --> 13:25.375
It's important.

13:25.458 --> 13:27.458
Please.

13:29.083 --> 13:30.834
COCHRAN: Kate McPherson's
back in L.A.

13:30.917 --> 13:34.834
The little charade
that you and Ray arranged

13:34.917 --> 13:36.542
obviously didn't work.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.375
She's still
asking questions.

13:38.458 --> 13:40.208
And any question
that leads back to me

13:40.291 --> 13:42.792
will eventually lead to you;
you understand that, don't you?

13:42.875 --> 13:44.208
Completely.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.125
Woman has to
be stopped.

13:45.208 --> 13:48.041
I agree.
But why are you coming to me?

13:48.125 --> 13:50.375
You're a powerful man.

13:50.458 --> 13:51.458
You ought to be able
to do something.

13:51.542 --> 13:54.041
Ray's got my hands tied.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.000
How?

13:57.250 --> 13:58.959
He caught me
in a compromising position.

14:00.875 --> 14:02.834
Ray's clever.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.792
You're the only person
in the world that he listens to.

14:08.875 --> 14:10.166
Yes, I am.

14:10.250 --> 14:14.709
I'm his father, in a way,
the one that cares about him.

14:16.792 --> 14:18.875
I'll set him straight.

14:20.834 --> 14:21.750
Ezra,

14:21.834 --> 14:25.250
thank you for being
a reasonable man.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.667
You understand
that Ray can't know

14:26.750 --> 14:28.625
that I'm connected to anything
that might happen.

14:28.709 --> 14:29.959
He won't.

14:31.667 --> 14:34.250
And I look forward to having
a very powerful friend

14:34.333 --> 14:35.709
in Washington.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.250
Of course, Ezra.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.041
You will.

14:41.542 --> 14:43.000
(door closes)

14:52.500 --> 14:53.458
Hi, Grandpa.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.959
Oh.

14:56.041 --> 14:58.125
What the fuck are you
doing here, Conor?

14:58.208 --> 14:59.333
Well, Mom found the joints

14:59.417 --> 15:00.917
and I think Dad's
going away somewhere.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
What do you want me
to do about it?

15:04.083 --> 15:05.083
I just thought...

15:05.166 --> 15:06.625
I'm pretty goddamn
disappointed in you, Conor.

15:06.709 --> 15:09.458
You don't just
show up here.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.834
You said to
come anytime.

15:10.917 --> 15:12.875
Well, this ain't
the time.

15:12.959 --> 15:14.709
Dad's right--
you are an asshole.

15:14.792 --> 15:17.458
You ain't going nowhere.

15:17.542 --> 15:18.834
I got business
to do tonight,

15:18.917 --> 15:22.417
and you're gonna sit tight till
I get back, you understand?

15:25.750 --> 15:28.834
Don't be upset.

15:28.917 --> 15:30.417
I lost my temper.

15:31.750 --> 15:34.375
Sit down.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.166
You all right?

15:36.250 --> 15:38.458
Yeah, Grandpa,
I'm fine.

15:38.542 --> 15:39.250
All right, good.
Listen.

15:39.333 --> 15:41.709
I got business
to take care of.

15:41.792 --> 15:43.208
I need you to help me
out and stay here.

15:43.291 --> 15:44.417
You do that for me,

15:44.500 --> 15:47.000
I'll tell you all about
it when I get back.

15:47.083 --> 15:48.959
You gonna rob someplace,
Grandpa?

15:49.041 --> 15:52.000
Relax. Sit back.
Put your feet up.

15:52.083 --> 15:55.000
There's magazines
under the bed.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.125
You get bored,

15:57.208 --> 16:00.208
knock on the door
directly across the hall.

16:06.417 --> 16:08.083
You nervous?

16:08.166 --> 16:10.083
No.

16:10.166 --> 16:11.417
Yeah, well, I am.

16:12.542 --> 16:13.542
Well, what are you doing here?

16:13.625 --> 16:16.875
Mick needs me.

16:17.959 --> 16:20.625
Mickey's robbed a lot of banks.

16:20.709 --> 16:22.500
That was a long time ago.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.834
Yeah, well, that scam he pulled
with you in Mexico--

16:24.917 --> 16:26.041
it worked, didn't it?

16:30.834 --> 16:32.375
(ringtone playing)

16:32.458 --> 16:33.625
Hello?

16:33.709 --> 16:36.208
What am I paying you for?

16:36.291 --> 16:37.834
To keep an eye on your father.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.041
He gave my kid drugs.

16:39.125 --> 16:39.709
I want him off the street, now.

16:39.792 --> 16:42.083
That wasn't the deal.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.166
I don't fucking care.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.917
You get it done,
you understand me?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.875
Look, I'll try to get
some shit on him,

16:46.959 --> 16:48.750
but he's been behaving himself.

16:48.834 --> 16:51.875
He goes to work, comes home.

16:51.959 --> 16:53.250
Figure it out, asshole.

16:53.333 --> 16:56.083
Or I call your boss
and tell him you're on the take.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.875
Who were you
talking to?

16:58.959 --> 17:00.625
My wife.

17:07.834 --> 17:11.792
Raymond, do you know about the
Jewish principle of the rodef?

17:12.709 --> 17:14.792
No, I don't.

17:14.875 --> 17:17.625
The rodef is someone
who's pursuing another,

17:17.709 --> 17:19.917
trying to destroy them.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.625
They must be
warned to stop.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.792
But if the rodef fails
to heed that warning,

17:25.875 --> 17:28.750
then according to Jewish law,
the rodef should be killed.

17:28.834 --> 17:30.583
I don't have time for this.

17:30.667 --> 17:31.917
Kate's the rodef,
Raymond.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.625
She's trying to destroy us.

17:35.709 --> 17:37.500
Everything you and I
have built.

17:37.583 --> 17:39.083
She's been warned.

17:39.166 --> 17:40.875
She has to be stopped.

17:43.875 --> 17:47.875
Listen to me, Ezra.

17:47.959 --> 17:49.625
Your precious RGOCC.

17:49.709 --> 17:50.375
What about it?

17:50.458 --> 17:53.041
There's a body
buried there.

17:53.125 --> 17:54.959
Catholic priest.

18:03.542 --> 18:07.834
You... buried a Catholic priest
at a Jewish hospital?

18:07.917 --> 18:10.458
Ruth's hospital?

18:10.542 --> 18:14.291
Ah! A Shanda!

18:14.375 --> 18:16.166
You cursed me, Raymond.

18:16.250 --> 18:18.041
You cursed Ruth's legacy.

18:18.125 --> 18:20.583
Anything happens
to Kate McPherson,

18:20.667 --> 18:22.333
that body comes up.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.917
(cell phone vibrating)

18:30.000 --> 18:31.417
Yeah, Lena?

18:31.500 --> 18:34.500
I just got a call from my plant
at Stalkerazzi; you were right.

18:34.583 --> 18:36.000
Somebody's got a video
of the Re-Kon shooting.

18:36.083 --> 18:37.500
So Marty's gonna set up
a meeting

18:37.583 --> 18:38.583
with them for later today.

18:38.667 --> 18:40.458
Good.
And, Ray...

18:40.542 --> 18:41.917
Cookie Brown's waiting
for you at Pink's.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
All right. Thanks.

18:43.083 --> 18:46.166
DARIUS: Yo, Cook!
What you want?

18:46.250 --> 18:49.417
I want the Rosie O'Donnell
with fries.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.834
I got the video.

19:05.917 --> 19:06.875
Ooh! My man!

19:06.959 --> 19:09.208
Hey, let's go,
right now.

19:09.291 --> 19:10.750
Got the million
dollars right here.

19:10.834 --> 19:12.333
You can't go.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.208
It's my money,
ain't it?

19:14.291 --> 19:16.583
You can't be seen anywhere
near that video, Cookie.

19:16.667 --> 19:18.041
Why not?

19:18.125 --> 19:20.166
You think it's gonna
incriminate me? For what?

19:20.250 --> 19:22.041
I'm just a
concerned citizen.

19:22.125 --> 19:25.166
Hey, get Omar in
here; we going.

19:25.250 --> 19:26.333
You're not going.

19:26.417 --> 19:29.458
You told me
I work for you now.

19:29.542 --> 19:30.875
Let me do my job.

19:31.583 --> 19:33.792
You got to trust me,
Cookie.

19:36.041 --> 19:37.667
Done.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.917
But as soon as you get it,
you bring it straight to me.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.083
Right.

19:45.000 --> 19:45.750
You want something
to eat, Ray?

19:45.834 --> 19:48.625
No, I'm good.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.417
What are we following
this guy for?

20:16.375 --> 20:18.583
(siren whoops)

20:19.750 --> 20:20.959
The fuck you doing?

20:21.041 --> 20:21.834
He ran a red light.

20:21.917 --> 20:24.291
Who gives a shit?
What's wrong with you?

20:47.625 --> 20:49.792
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

20:49.875 --> 20:50.959
What the fuck going on?

20:51.041 --> 20:52.250
You ran a red light.
(laughs)

20:52.333 --> 20:54.875
What?
We didn't run
no goddamn red light.

20:54.959 --> 20:55.917
License and registration.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.333
You look real nervous.

20:58.417 --> 20:59.333
You okay?
Shut the fuck up

20:59.417 --> 21:00.000
and step out
of the car.

21:00.083 --> 21:02.000
Jim, what are
you doing?

21:02.083 --> 21:03.041
What I got to
step out for?

21:03.125 --> 21:05.250
'Cause I'm a black man
riding in a $235,000 car?

21:05.333 --> 21:08.375
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of the car.

21:08.458 --> 21:09.667
DAVE:
Jim.

21:09.750 --> 21:10.542
Can I speak to you?

21:10.625 --> 21:13.041
Yeah, Jim.
Go talk to your partner.

21:13.125 --> 21:14.166
Y'all figure
this shit out.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.917
Get the fuck out of the car
like I just told you!

21:17.000 --> 21:18.500
I'm not fucking
getting out of this car!

21:18.583 --> 21:19.583
Hey, hey, yo!

21:19.667 --> 21:22.125
Put your hands
where the man can see them.

21:22.208 --> 21:23.166
Now, my brother,

21:23.250 --> 21:26.500
you know this is
some bullshit.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.083
You're good.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.709
Get the fuck
out of here.

21:34.792 --> 21:37.166
Yeah. I know we're good,
motherfucker.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.709
What the fuck
was that?

21:46.792 --> 21:48.709
Nothing.

21:48.792 --> 21:51.500
You want to tell me
what's in your pocket?

21:51.583 --> 21:52.542
What are you talking about?

21:52.625 --> 21:53.166
I saw you reach in your pocket

21:53.250 --> 21:54.959
when you pulled him over.

21:59.041 --> 22:00.959
(cell phone vibrating)

22:01.041 --> 22:03.125
AVI:
Abby's boyfriend

22:03.208 --> 22:04.041
just pulled over Cookie Brown,

22:04.125 --> 22:06.250
and then let him go.

22:06.333 --> 22:07.959
Fuck.

22:08.041 --> 22:10.709
Boss, Lena says
you're giving away property?

22:10.792 --> 22:11.709
Signing deeds?

22:11.792 --> 22:12.709
Not now, Avi.

22:12.792 --> 22:13.625
What's going on?

22:13.709 --> 22:14.834
You get a paycheck, don't you?

22:14.917 --> 22:17.917
Just cash it, stop asking me
fucking questions.

22:31.166 --> 22:34.250
Come on, let's go.

22:47.125 --> 22:48.333
Come on.

22:48.417 --> 22:49.959
You go, too. We're closing.

22:50.041 --> 22:51.834
You sure, hon?

22:51.917 --> 22:53.291
You know you liked it last time.

22:53.375 --> 22:54.417
Not tonight.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.792
I get married tomorrow.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.792
I need sperm to be strong
for wedding night.

22:59.875 --> 23:01.458
Besides, last time
you chafed me.

23:01.542 --> 23:03.917
I never chafed nobody
in my fucking life.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.041
Come on, let's go.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.125
Come on, Boris.

23:07.208 --> 23:08.792
If you're getting married
tomorrow night,

23:08.875 --> 23:09.834
tonight's your
bachelor party.

23:09.917 --> 23:12.667
Yeah?

23:12.750 --> 23:14.542
I'll give you a discount.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.875
(Boris panting, moaning)

23:41.417 --> 23:43.625
(grunting, shouting in Russian)

23:47.917 --> 23:49.875
Thanks for being here, Terry.

23:49.959 --> 23:51.500
Means a lot to me.

23:51.583 --> 23:54.333
I'm here 'cause
I got no choice.

23:54.417 --> 23:55.250
And why'd you get Daryll
mixed up in this?

23:55.333 --> 23:57.250
(door beeps, handle turns)

23:59.583 --> 24:00.875
Son of bitch.

24:25.625 --> 24:27.625
♪ ♪

24:50.125 --> 24:51.959
Let's go.

24:59.667 --> 25:02.583
What?

25:02.667 --> 25:05.959
So where's the
fucking safe?

25:06.041 --> 25:08.166
It was right here.

25:08.250 --> 25:10.208
It's got to be
here somewhere.

25:18.166 --> 25:20.083
Here it is.

25:20.166 --> 25:23.250
I told you.

25:23.333 --> 25:25.583
We got to lift that?

25:25.667 --> 25:26.959
That's what you're here for.

25:35.834 --> 25:37.375
What the fuck
took so long?!

25:37.458 --> 25:39.125
Keep your fucking
voice down.

25:39.208 --> 25:40.500
Daryll, grab the dolly.

25:40.583 --> 25:42.834
Let's get this safe
the hell out of here.

25:42.917 --> 25:45.125
Anyone comes along, flash
the badge. Get rid of them.

25:45.208 --> 25:46.750
I know why I'm here.

25:56.709 --> 25:58.709
You have a lot of crazy shit.

26:06.375 --> 26:09.125
My dad made that
for me.

26:09.208 --> 26:10.834
Was he at camp?

26:10.917 --> 26:13.000
(chuckles)

26:13.083 --> 26:14.375
No.

26:14.458 --> 26:18.125
He was in Alcatraz
at the time.

26:18.208 --> 26:19.333
Did he escape?

26:19.417 --> 26:21.625
Nobody escapes The Rock, kid.

26:21.709 --> 26:22.792
(knocking)

26:23.959 --> 26:25.500
Here you go, Shorty.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.375
There you are!
Where you been?

26:27.458 --> 26:28.542
You supposed
to be here yesterday.

26:28.625 --> 26:30.083
I'm almost out.
I know, I know.

26:33.542 --> 26:35.583
Kid, could you bring
one of those over?

26:35.667 --> 26:37.208
Sure.

26:41.458 --> 26:42.166
Here, hook it
on for me.

26:42.250 --> 26:46.041
(sighs)

26:47.125 --> 26:48.875
Yeah, turn it
all the way up.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.709
Ah, yeah.
That's the stuff.

26:53.792 --> 26:54.917
(breathes deeply)

27:00.583 --> 27:02.041
Are you sick?

27:03.333 --> 27:06.500
I... inhaled a lot
of Agent Orange in Vietnam.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.000
Are you gonna die?

27:11.125 --> 27:12.542
Yeah, I think so.

27:16.041 --> 27:17.333
What's going on with Marty?

27:17.417 --> 27:18.458
Am I going over
there or not?

27:18.542 --> 27:19.500
Nobody's shown up yet.

27:19.583 --> 27:21.041
Fuck.

27:21.125 --> 27:21.875
Check again.

27:21.959 --> 27:24.792
They have someone
in your office.

27:45.208 --> 27:47.875
I'm going home.

27:47.959 --> 27:50.917
Should have stayed there.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.625
You didn't
scare me off.

27:52.709 --> 27:54.333
I have my story.

27:54.417 --> 27:56.500
Congratulations.

27:56.583 --> 27:59.375
Maybe you'll win
another Pulitzer.

27:59.458 --> 28:01.208
You brought Sully
out here.

28:01.291 --> 28:02.542
He killed
a lot of people.

28:02.625 --> 28:04.959
Aren't you responsible for that?

28:05.041 --> 28:05.583
I don't know, Kate.

28:05.667 --> 28:08.333
I'm just fucking tired.

28:08.417 --> 28:10.625
No, Ray, you're sick.

28:10.709 --> 28:11.917
You need help.

28:18.083 --> 28:20.291
What do you want?

28:22.208 --> 28:22.959
I don't know.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.041
Maybe I thought
you'd beg me not to do it.

28:33.250 --> 28:34.500
I'm sorry, Ray.

28:34.583 --> 28:36.041
What are you sorry for?

28:36.125 --> 28:38.000
You're just doing
your job.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.834

29:17.875 --> 29:19.458

Go, go, go, go, go, go!

29:30.542 --> 29:32.041
I got to move here.

29:47.083 --> 29:48.583
This is for you.

29:49.500 --> 29:50.583
This is for Avi.

29:50.667 --> 29:51.625
What is this, severance?

29:51.709 --> 29:53.333
I'm out of a job?

29:53.417 --> 29:55.375
No, I don't want...
I don't want this.

29:55.458 --> 29:56.667
I don't want this. I just...

29:56.750 --> 29:57.333
I want to keep working,
same as Avi.

29:57.417 --> 29:59.333
Take it, Lena.

29:59.417 --> 30:00.667
I don't know
what's going on with you.

30:00.750 --> 30:03.417
But you won't tell me,
and you won't tell Avi.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.709
So fuck you.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.917
I don't need your money.
I'll be fine.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.250
You'll be fine?

30:10.333 --> 30:12.083
How many girlfriends
have you beaten up?

30:12.166 --> 30:14.166
How many times
I had to bail you out?

30:16.959 --> 30:18.875
Take the fucking money.

30:18.959 --> 30:21.208
(phone ringing)

30:21.291 --> 30:22.625
What?

30:22.709 --> 30:23.375
Stalkerazzi.
It's on.

30:23.458 --> 30:26.333
All right, thank you.

30:43.333 --> 30:45.041
(laughs)
I got one for you.

30:47.250 --> 30:50.333
How many Vietnam vets does it
take to screw in a lightbulb?

30:50.417 --> 30:51.458
I don't know. How many?

30:51.542 --> 30:53.083
You weren't there, man!

30:55.375 --> 30:58.333
(both laugh)

31:04.000 --> 31:05.458
Oh, I feel dizzy.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.166
Why don't you go
lay down in Mick's bed.

31:10.250 --> 31:14.542
I might have bed bugs, and
I don't want to get yelled at.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.458
Okay.

31:24.625 --> 31:27.500
One, two, three.

31:33.875 --> 31:34.458
In here!
Here.

31:34.542 --> 31:36.709
Go shut him up.

31:36.792 --> 31:38.709
Don't give me
no fucking orders.

31:38.792 --> 31:42.166
BORIS:
I'm in here! Anyone! Help!

31:49.792 --> 31:52.417
Fucking morons
are still here?

31:52.500 --> 31:54.542
Shut your mouth.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.000
Armored truck came this morning.

32:00.083 --> 32:01.500
What?

32:01.583 --> 32:02.792
You made big mistake.

32:02.875 --> 32:04.125
Bullshit.

32:05.208 --> 32:06.000
You do your pickups
on Thursdays.

32:06.083 --> 32:08.625
We changed company.
They come early.

32:10.083 --> 32:10.667
You're lying to me.

32:10.750 --> 32:12.667
You will find out.

32:12.750 --> 32:14.250

(cell phone vibrating)

32:41.125 --> 32:42.458
Yeah.

32:42.542 --> 32:43.917
How much would it be
worth to you

32:44.000 --> 32:45.542
if I could put
your father away tonight?

32:45.625 --> 32:46.875
You tell me.

32:46.959 --> 32:47.875
A hundred grand.

32:47.959 --> 32:50.583
For that much,
it'd better stick.

32:50.667 --> 32:51.250
I'm talking felony-- 20 years.

32:51.333 --> 32:53.250
Do it.

32:59.166 --> 33:01.458
Ray. I was just getting
ready to call you.

33:01.542 --> 33:02.166
Sure you were.

33:02.250 --> 33:02.959
Where's the
video, Marty?

33:03.041 --> 33:05.542
I'm getting it, but...
But what?

33:05.625 --> 33:06.208
Well, now they want
two million.

33:07.792 --> 33:10.375
Now, Ray, look, I saw it.

33:10.458 --> 33:12.041
It's worth it.
Where are they?

33:12.125 --> 33:14.458
I'm not sure.
They're supposed to contact me

33:14.542 --> 33:16.375
in the next 30 minutes.

33:19.542 --> 33:21.333
You're a fucking liar, Marty.

33:21.417 --> 33:23.417
Ray?

33:23.500 --> 33:25.834
Don't start any shit
in my place of business.

33:25.917 --> 33:27.625
Get ready
to call someone.

33:27.709 --> 33:29.375
Troy, stand your ground.

33:31.125 --> 33:33.625
You know what I did
to Chip, right?

33:33.709 --> 33:34.291
Is he worth it?

33:40.417 --> 33:41.792
Fuck you.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.917
I want my $2,000.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.458
He means $20,000.

34:12.208 --> 34:15.500
How many copies of
this did you make?

34:15.583 --> 34:17.458
We didn't make
any copies.

34:17.542 --> 34:19.875
I didn't ask you.
I asked him.

34:23.208 --> 34:25.125
None, I swear.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.166
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, man.

34:47.250 --> 34:49.667
What's taking
this dude so long?

34:49.750 --> 34:50.625
MICKEY:
Relax, kid.

34:50.709 --> 34:52.291
What'd you bring him in
for anyway, Mick?

34:52.375 --> 34:53.625
He's not family.
What was I
supposed to do?

34:53.709 --> 34:54.333
I still got this

34:54.417 --> 34:56.125
ankle bracelet
on, don't I?

34:56.208 --> 34:58.125
You're so worried about him,
go check.

35:16.041 --> 35:17.542
Where is he?

35:17.625 --> 35:18.875
Your friend?

35:18.959 --> 35:20.792
He took the keys.

35:20.875 --> 35:22.458
He fucked you.

35:22.542 --> 35:24.041
What?

35:24.125 --> 35:25.709
(laughs)

35:27.083 --> 35:28.417
Son of a...

35:32.041 --> 35:34.125
(panting)

35:41.250 --> 35:43.250
MICKEY:
What's going on in there?

35:43.333 --> 35:45.041
I'm locked in!

35:45.125 --> 35:46.750
Where's Ronald?

35:46.834 --> 35:48.959
He fucked us over!

35:56.291 --> 35:58.417
Get the fuck out
of here, Mick!

35:58.500 --> 36:01.291
(sirens approaching)

36:01.375 --> 36:03.250
Get out of here.

36:05.667 --> 36:06.375
Terry...

36:11.000 --> 36:12.458
Terry.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.417
(sirens approaching)

36:23.333 --> 36:23.750
Drive.

36:23.834 --> 36:26.917
Where's Terry?

36:27.000 --> 36:28.291
Just drive, son.

36:30.625 --> 36:32.500
(engine starts)

36:46.959 --> 36:48.875
(two gunshots over phone)

36:48.959 --> 36:51.875
(tires screech)

36:58.709 --> 37:01.417
Daddy?

37:14.291 --> 37:15.417
(cell phone vibrating)

37:19.709 --> 37:21.000
Talk to me, Ray Donovan.

37:21.083 --> 37:22.625
Did you get it?

37:22.709 --> 37:23.792
Yeah.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.000
Well, when am I gonna see it?

37:25.083 --> 37:25.959
Right now.

37:26.041 --> 37:27.000
Where can I meet you?

37:27.083 --> 37:27.709
My house.

37:27.792 --> 37:29.458
Half an hour.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.417
I'll go get Shorty.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.083
All right, hurry
the fuck up, Pop.

37:39.166 --> 37:41.083
We got cops up our ass.
Be right back.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.125
(oxygen hissing)

37:54.709 --> 37:56.959
(sighs)

38:14.959 --> 38:17.917
(gas hissing)

38:24.917 --> 38:27.542
(alarm ringing)

38:31.917 --> 38:35.709
(tires screeching)

38:38.709 --> 38:40.208
Conor?

38:42.125 --> 38:44.166
Conor!

38:51.583 --> 38:52.625
CONOR:
Grandpa...

38:52.709 --> 38:56.458
(grunts)

38:56.542 --> 38:57.834
What the fuck?!

38:59.375 --> 39:00.083
Con!

39:00.166 --> 39:02.792
(sirens approaching)

39:02.875 --> 39:03.792
(groans)

39:03.875 --> 39:06.458
You all right?

39:06.542 --> 39:08.750
Huh? You all right?

39:08.834 --> 39:09.959
I think it's broken.

39:10.041 --> 39:11.750
(panting)

39:11.834 --> 39:12.291
Here.

39:12.375 --> 39:14.375
Let's get you up.

39:14.458 --> 39:16.083
(groans)

39:16.166 --> 39:18.291
Let's get out of here.

39:19.125 --> 39:21.709
Let's go, come on.

39:21.792 --> 39:23.792
Jesus help me.

39:23.875 --> 39:25.125
What the fuck happened?

39:25.208 --> 39:26.083
(coughs)

39:26.166 --> 39:26.917
I think Shorty blew.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.875
Oh, damn, Shorty.

39:34.375 --> 39:35.041
I think I killed him.

39:35.125 --> 39:37.250
You didn't
kill no one.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.083
Keep moving.

39:39.166 --> 39:41.458
(phone ringing)

39:41.542 --> 39:41.792
Con?

39:41.875 --> 39:43.959
Dad?

39:44.041 --> 39:45.875
I'm at Grandpa's.

39:45.959 --> 39:46.458
What?

39:46.542 --> 39:48.125
There was an explosion,

39:48.208 --> 39:48.834
and I think I broke my arm.

39:48.917 --> 39:51.125
Jesus Christ.

39:51.208 --> 39:53.083
(tires screeching)

39:55.375 --> 39:57.542
Stay there, Conor.
I'm coming.

39:57.625 --> 39:59.625
Okay.

39:59.709 --> 40:00.125
What'd he say?
He's coming?

40:00.208 --> 40:02.125
He's on his way.

40:13.959 --> 40:14.667
Thank you.

40:17.583 --> 40:20.500
How is your mother?

40:22.417 --> 40:23.875
She is good.

40:23.959 --> 40:25.166
Good.

40:25.250 --> 40:25.834
I'm worried about Ray.

40:25.917 --> 40:29.125
Me, too.

40:29.208 --> 40:30.542
You're a good
friend to him.

40:30.625 --> 40:33.625
When he lets me.

40:33.709 --> 40:34.250
Avi,

40:34.333 --> 40:37.125
are you an observant Jew?

40:39.083 --> 40:40.000
I try.

40:40.083 --> 40:43.625
Have you ever heard of
the law of the rodef?

41:01.750 --> 41:03.208
(sighs)

41:08.125 --> 41:10.709
(ringing)

41:16.583 --> 41:17.709
JIM:
Abby...

41:20.667 --> 41:22.125
I couldn't do it.

41:22.208 --> 41:24.625
(sighs)

41:37.959 --> 41:39.375
(keypad beeping)

41:52.166 --> 41:54.333
(indistinct chatter)

42:02.583 --> 42:03.417
Right there.

42:03.500 --> 42:05.417
Hey, Conor. What happened?

42:07.583 --> 42:09.125
You okay?

42:09.208 --> 42:10.834
It's probably just
a hairline fracture.

42:10.917 --> 42:12.542
We need an X-ray
to be sure.

42:12.625 --> 42:13.667
Where you taking him?

42:13.750 --> 42:14.583
County.

42:14.667 --> 42:15.333
Nah, he'll be there all night.

42:15.417 --> 42:17.041
I'll take him
to Cedars myself.

42:17.125 --> 42:17.750
Come on, Conor.

42:17.834 --> 42:19.542
Well, at least
let me wrap it.

42:19.625 --> 42:21.750
I'll go do it
in the ambulance.

42:21.834 --> 42:22.709
Come with me.

42:26.625 --> 42:28.917
Just... watch
your step over here.

42:30.542 --> 42:32.417
Just hop on into
the ambulance there.

42:32.500 --> 42:34.458
How fast do you think
he went?

42:34.542 --> 42:35.709
It was instant.

42:35.792 --> 42:37.083
I'm sorry.

42:37.166 --> 42:37.875
MICKEY: Thank God
for that, anyway.

42:41.709 --> 42:43.542
You almost killed
your grandson.

42:43.625 --> 42:44.834
You happy now?

42:44.917 --> 42:47.625
He's tougher than you think,
but we got bigger problems.

42:47.709 --> 42:49.917
Terry needs some help.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.291
The fuck are you
talking about?

42:51.375 --> 42:52.583
He's gonna need a lawyer.

42:52.667 --> 42:53.709
We pulled a little job.

42:53.792 --> 42:56.834
Ray, you got to make sure
he keeps his mouth shut.

42:56.917 --> 42:57.583
You dragged him
into your shit?

42:57.667 --> 43:00.333
He begged me
to come in on it.

43:00.417 --> 43:01.542
He begged me.

43:01.625 --> 43:02.750
You're a
fucking liar.

43:02.834 --> 43:04.083
Where is he?

43:04.166 --> 43:06.417
Cops probably
got him by now.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.500
You need to hook him up
with Ezra; it's serious.

43:08.583 --> 43:10.667
Armed robbery.

43:11.583 --> 43:12.875
(officers shouting)

43:12.959 --> 43:13.875
I'll fucking kill you!

43:13.959 --> 43:15.000
You hear me?!
Get off!

43:15.083 --> 43:16.583
I'll fucking kill you!
Get off him!

43:19.333 --> 43:21.375
Thank you, Officer.

43:21.458 --> 43:23.083
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

43:23.166 --> 43:24.250
Hey.

43:24.333 --> 43:26.000
You need to
fucking calm down.

43:26.083 --> 43:27.375
Sorry.
You hear me?

43:27.458 --> 43:29.041
Yeah.

43:31.166 --> 43:31.917
Don't fucking move.

43:33.583 --> 43:35.333
I'll fucking kill you!

43:35.417 --> 43:36.709
You hear me?!

43:36.792 --> 43:38.375
Don't fucking
go near him again!

43:38.458 --> 43:40.125
Get him the fuck away from me!

43:40.208 --> 43:41.834
(grunts) No!

43:41.917 --> 43:42.875
Please, you don't understand.

43:42.959 --> 43:44.000
I got to
take care of my kid!

43:44.083 --> 43:47.166
Oh, fuck.

43:50.208 --> 43:51.125
Conor!

43:51.208 --> 43:53.458
Conor!

43:53.542 --> 43:54.667
It's all right.
Just go with them.

43:54.750 --> 43:57.625
It's all right, Con.
It's all right.

43:59.375 --> 44:02.083
(phone vibrating)

44:02.166 --> 44:04.583
Fuck.

44:04.667 --> 44:06.750
I'm here waiting, motherfucker.

44:06.834 --> 44:08.875
Where are you?

44:08.959 --> 44:10.917
I need to see that video, Ray.

44:13.083 --> 44:15.834
I'm his grandfather.

44:15.917 --> 44:17.375
I'll take care of it.

44:17.458 --> 44:19.375
OFFICER:
You okay?

44:19.458 --> 44:20.375
Yeah.

44:20.458 --> 44:22.583
Get him out of here.
