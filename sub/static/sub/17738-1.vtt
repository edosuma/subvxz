00:40.331 --> 00:41.775
What are you doing?

00:42.610 --> 00:46.910
I thought about trying to
kill the bugs one by one

00:47.310 --> 00:48.531
I guess that's better
than pesticides

00:48.730 --> 00:50.580
Her husband wanted me
to take a look at this.

00:50.930 --> 00:52.530
He says use it

00:52.770 --> 00:54.331
Yes he is going to dive

00:54.830 --> 00:58.390
Yes, there is a small problem
with the trigger here

00:58.490 --> 01:02.830
Listen, I did this. It is a
flavoring of tomato leaves

01:02.930 --> 01:03.692
Tomato

01:05.410 --> 01:07.331
Bugs will love this

01:07.430 --> 01:09.220
I tell you at least not
to stop using some

01:09.850 --> 01:12.290
Kind of chemical war is lost

01:12.490 --> 01:16.430
It's like attacking a PANSA
division with stones and sticks

01:16.510 --> 01:18.230
Well, we'll see

01:18.330 --> 01:19.537
How did it go?

01:20.110 --> 01:21.036
How was what?

01:21.430 --> 01:22.894
The girl

01:23.650 --> 01:27.070
She called me and asked for an appointment.

01:27.370 --> 01:28.291
Y...?

01:28.650 --> 01:30.414
And nothing, I hung up

01:31.530 --> 01:32.910
You hung up

01:34.010 --> 01:34.999
Yes, it's a protocol issue.

01:35.310 --> 01:38.410
After hanging up, I called and
asked for an appointment.

01:38.810 --> 01:41.417
My God, you're an
old-fashioned idiot.

01:41.777 --> 01:43.910
I'm going to take her to the city,
I'm going to take her to dance

01:44.410 --> 01:45.830
To dance

01:46.430 --> 01:47.350
Yes

01:48.450 --> 01:49.350
I'm a good dancer

01:49.550 --> 01:50.950
What kind of dance?

01:51.050 --> 01:51.790
Everybody

01:52.290 --> 01:54.770
Mambo, rumba, zamba, swing

01:54.970 --> 01:57.230
- Cha-cha - Show me

01:58.330 --> 01:59.390
Do you know any ballroom dancing?

01:59.590 --> 02:00.750
Any

02:02.850 --> 02:05.020
Well, basic rumba, foot back, one at a time

02:05.370 --> 02:08.935
Back with your right foot
and then follow me okay?

02:09.370 --> 02:13.299
And... one, two, three, four, forward

02:14.410 --> 02:15.699
And I wanted to ask him if he could change

02:16.370 --> 02:18.354
Days and come tomorrow instead of Friday...

02:18.850 --> 02:19.630
Yes of course

02:19.730 --> 02:22.659
There it is, there it is, that was
very good, you are an innate.

02:23.355 --> 02:24.974
- No more

02:25.390 --> 02:28.240
I have a lot to do today, I have
to climb on the roof to clean it

02:28.410 --> 02:31.034
That was enough, it was
a good first lesson

02:31.970 --> 02:35.910
- Okay - Okay

02:39.410 --> 02:43.180
- Try it - What a waste of time

02:52.001 --> 02:53.131
Good afternoon, Carl.

02:53.885 --> 02:54.574
How is Mr. Dudek?

02:54.710 --> 02:55.375
Great

02:55.810 --> 02:56.375
How is your day going?

02:56.610 --> 02:57.875
Quite well thank you

02:58.110 --> 02:59.120
Do you know if Silvia is in the house?

02:59.333 --> 03:00.675
Yes, she is in the back

03:01.111 --> 03:02.329
In the garden?

03:02.555 --> 03:03.218
In the garden, yes.

03:03.444 --> 03:04.444
Thanks Carl

03:42.210 --> 03:44.910
You arrived early. How was your day?

03:45.210 --> 03:47.410
Today was a great day

03:49.210 --> 03:50.410
Very productive. How about yours?

03:51.410 --> 03:55.410
Much more productive than yours.
Velho was wonderful

03:56.410 --> 03:58.410
Old man. Did you spend all day reading?

03:59.610 --> 03:59.210
maybe

04:00.410 --> 04:04.210
I also made some calls and scheduled
interviews with potential investors

04:04.410 --> 04:05.610
Congratulations!!!

04:07.410 --> 04:08.610
What time will they be here?

04:09.010 --> 04:09.610
I told Shean that at 6

04:09.710 --> 04:11.010
So probably at 7

04:11.310 --> 04:12.420
You already know it

04:13.310 --> 04:15.020
No, but you know the Shean prototype.

04:15.310 --> 04:16.620
I bet he's very young

04:17.310 --> 04:19.620
Of course. All are

04:21.110 --> 04:22.019
Jealous!

04:22.410 --> 04:23.420
I?

04:24.410 --> 04:25.420
Of course not

04:26.410 --> 04:28.420
What would he be jealous of?

04:29.410 --> 04:32.420
I do not know, Shean and
all her little whores

04:32.910 --> 04:33.620
Soaps

04:35.910 --> 04:36.620
Well, I have

04:37.410 --> 04:39.620
The sweetest of all

04:40.210 --> 04:41.620
Shean is the one who should be jealous

04:42.410 --> 04:43.220
Okay

04:44.410 --> 04:45.620
I have to take a shower

04:46.010 --> 04:47.920
I'll make my cocktail for everyone

04:48.410 --> 04:49.420
Please

06:46.210 --> 06:47.410
Watch this

06:48.410 --> 06:51.410
Yes, this is the most beautiful thing
you have ever seen in your life.

06:51.710 --> 06:54.410
I know I should have waited, but
once I saw her I had to have her

06:54.710 --> 06:56.410
It was a chemistry, like
a sexual chemistry.

06:56.810 --> 06:57.910
Hi, I'm Cristina.

06:58.410 --> 06:59.410
Oh yeah. This is Cristina

06:59.810 --> 07:02.110
Look, man, you have to drive it, okay?

07:02.410 --> 07:04.331
This is Silvia, Mark's wife.

07:05.310 --> 07:07.321
- Hello - It's nice to meet you.

07:07.410 --> 07:08.321
Yes

07:08.410 --> 07:09.321
Yes baby

07:09.331 --> 07:10.329
Why are not they going to have a drink?

07:10.431 --> 07:12.329
My partner and I had
an exciting week

07:12.431 --> 07:13.885
Many great news to share

07:15.431 --> 07:16.335
So let's talk a little

07:16.435 --> 07:17.331
Maybe dance a little, who knows

07:17.431 --> 07:18.329
Let's be inside, see you later

07:18.431 --> 07:19.329
- Ok - I'll be back in a moment.

07:19.431 --> 07:21.329
- Let's go - Okay

07:21.431 --> 07:23.329
They are just going to go

07:25.431 --> 07:26.529
I like your dress

07:28.329 --> 07:29.529
Thanks it's new

07:29.629 --> 07:30.329
Yes

07:36.331 --> 07:37.329
What is that?

07:37.331 --> 07:38.329
I missed you too

07:38.441 --> 07:42.329
After leaving the store and
getting that sweet car

07:42.441 --> 07:44.885
I was thinking of buying
something for my girl

07:45.331 --> 07:46.885
This is Spanish for girls

07:47.331 --> 07:50.329
And she is adorable and
would like to buy some skin

07:50.331 --> 07:53.329
It would be nice for winter

07:53.331 --> 07:54.331
What do you think? Too soon?

07:54.431 --> 07:56.331
You've seen Good Fellas, right?

07:56.431 --> 07:57.431
Specifically the scene
of the pink Cadillac

07:57.531 --> 07:59.218
Shit, I love that movie.

07:59.331 --> 08:01.218
You're talking to me, dammit!

08:01.331 --> 08:02.441
You're talking to me!

08:02.552 --> 08:03.441
Yes, it's good

08:03.552 --> 08:06.218
Each one is from a different
part of the world

08:06.885 --> 08:10.218
You've definitely traveled a lot

08:10.329 --> 08:12.218
Yes, and this is my favorite

08:12.441 --> 08:15.885
It is the Ketzoal that is a
symbol of freedom in Guatemala

08:16.329 --> 08:19.885
You know, this bird dies of sadness
if it is enclosed in a cage

08:20.441 --> 08:23.885
It was okay, I left the car in the parking lot

08:24.441 --> 08:27.218
I picked up my phone, came back
and those two were in the trunk

08:27.329 --> 08:29.329
Yes, yes, yes, you saw it or it was like...

08:29.529 --> 08:31.329
in and out

08:31.430 --> 08:32.429
Exact exact

08:32.630 --> 08:33.996
Good man form, professional

08:37.107 --> 08:35.328
The next one is going to be very good.

08:35.441 --> 08:39.331
I have some ideas, thinking,
just thinking, you know

08:40.441 --> 08:41.830
I thought it was one thing at a time

08:42.130 --> 08:45.130
Yes, of course once, it's fucked
up money, friend let's go

08:45.331 --> 08:46.329
No one will resign

08:46.331 --> 08:50.218
Or could we by prudence

08:50.331 --> 08:53.329
Good song "Dear Prudence..."

08:58.331 --> 09:00.329
The shit of prudence,
these fucking types

09:00.331 --> 09:02.331
They are traffickers. Do you want to disappoint them?

09:02.431 --> 09:03.331
You have expectations you know

09:03.531 --> 09:05.331
One thing I learned about these guys

09:05.531 --> 09:07.331
After that meeting that was
fucking weird, by the way

09:07.531 --> 09:09.331
Are 2 things they do not like

09:09.531 --> 09:11.331
State taxes and be disappointed

09:11.531 --> 09:13.331
If we follow the risk it will
become increasingly high

09:13.531 --> 09:19.331
While reflecting on
money and caramel

09:17.531 --> 09:16.331
Fortune favors the brave

09:18.531 --> 09:20.331
Is an Instagram fee or
some shit like that

09:21.531 --> 09:23.331
Fortune favors the clever

09:23.531 --> 09:25.331
Ends while you're up,
now that's smart

09:25.531 --> 09:27.331
Nobody does that,
that's super old school

09:27.531 --> 09:29.631
The prisons are full of brave men

09:30.231 --> 09:31.331
What is this as a marriage?

09:31.531 --> 09:33.331
You're gonna end all the fun.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.331
Like what?

09:36.131 --> 09:36.531
As...

09:37.131 --> 09:38.531
Like the fucking water,
the music goes out

09:39.131 --> 09:40.531
In the middle of the
party when we're dancing

09:41.131 --> 09:42.531
Hears. Who is the idiot
who took the music?

09:42.931 --> 09:44.531
It's Mark, it's Mark, it's my friend Mark

09:44.831 --> 09:46.531
Now we're just starting, you know

09:48.329 --> 09:49.531
Come on, you and me, my friend.

09:49.831 --> 09:50.531
Having a good time

09:51.329 --> 09:53.107
We're not going to change that.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.531
Get a stick

09:55.931 --> 09:57.531
And put some things in a hole

09:57.931 --> 09:59.531
Okay, I say a big ten game, come on

09:59.931 --> 10:01.531
Come on, do not be a coward.

10:01.931 --> 10:02.531
20, two balls in a hole

10:02.931 --> 10:04.331
Two balls in a hole?

10:04.831 --> 10:06.218
I'm being brave, you wanted
bravery ?, you got it

10:06.329 --> 10:08.885
You're being reckless,
that's not trust

10:09.329 --> 10:10.885
That's why you need me
by your side, my friend

10:11.329 --> 10:13.329
Well, let's see that

10:23.885 --> 10:25.329
You know what? I'm going to keep the vodka

10:25.431 --> 10:29.329
I do not need your little elexor, thank you.

10:31.218 --> 10:33.329
Would you like something?

10:33.552 --> 10:35.329
I'm vegetarian, thank you

10:35.552 --> 10:38.329
I knew it, as soon as I saw it, I knew it.

10:38.552 --> 10:41.329
You've been vegetarian for...

10:41.552 --> 10:42.885
about a year

10:43.329 --> 10:44.339
Over six months

10:44.729 --> 10:46.339
How did you know?

10:46.729 --> 10:48.339
I can just realize

10:48.729 --> 10:52.339
Is on the skin catches like
a greenish vegetable shade

10:53.729 --> 10:55.339
- What? Like the Undead - No

10:55.729 --> 11:00.107
Is this how I look at you?
Like a living dead?

11:00.729 --> 11:03.339
Hey, do not worry, it's the
right time to be a zombie

11:04.729 --> 11:06.339
You know what? He is right. It's
like the vanguard of fashion

11:06.729 --> 11:08.339
That's what everyone wants,
that's what you like

11:08.729 --> 11:12.339
Every time something bad happens
the zombies appear everywhere

11:13.331 --> 11:15.339
Hey... I need to go to the
bathroom, is it through that door?

11:15.731 --> 11:17.339
Yes, down the hallway

11:17.731 --> 11:19.339
We were just joking

11:20.731 --> 11:22.339
She is so sensitive

11:22.731 --> 11:25.339
Wait. Are not you a
fucking vegetarian too?

11:44.731 --> 11:48.339
You guys are so fun

11:48.731 --> 11:49.339
You are practicing your spanish

11:49.731 --> 11:50.339
There is

11:50.731 --> 11:51.774
I learned a little, in the room

11:52.218 --> 11:53.774
I'll lend you a book.

11:55.218 --> 11:57.331
We have good news

11:57.774 --> 11:59.774
We are trying to have a baby

12:00.331 --> 12:02.331
Irresponsible news

12:03.331 --> 12:04.331
Jesus!

12:05.107 --> 12:06.331
What's up?

12:07.331 --> 12:09.331
Having a child is a
crime against humanity

12:09.531 --> 12:11.331
Basically there should
be laws against it

12:11.731 --> 12:13.331
Are you kidding?

12:13.731 --> 12:15.331
At least until the world's population
drops to a reasonable level

12:15.531 --> 12:16.551
Shut up! What are you saying?

12:16.731 --> 12:19.551
7 billion people and growing
per minute is what I say

12:19.731 --> 12:22.551
But China and India are the ones
that have a problem, not us

12:22.731 --> 12:25.551
Yes, and they already have the rule of
one child per house, it is not enough

12:25.731 --> 12:27.551
You have to think radically
about this, guys.

12:27.731 --> 12:29.551
Or there is not going to be room for us

12:29.731 --> 12:31.551
There's a lot of space out there

12:31.731 --> 12:33.551
And the destiny of the human
race is to conquer the stars

12:33.731 --> 12:35.551
She says the space

12:36.329 --> 12:38.551
That's cute

12:38.885 --> 12:39.774
That is sweet darling

12:39.885 --> 12:42.774
Well, I think it's great
news, congratulations!

12:43.218 --> 12:46.774
It's a bit early yet,
Silvia is not yet pregnant

12:46.996 --> 12:47.996
False alarm

12:48.218 --> 12:49.774
Forget everything I said guys, health

13:00.080 --> 13:02.410
Hello, may I help you?

13:03.580 --> 13:05.210
Hi, sorry to interrupt.

13:05.331 --> 13:06.410
My name is John, I'm your new neighbor.

13:06.831 --> 13:09.331
As far as I know, in fact
your only neighbor for now

13:09.731 --> 13:12.331
Because I'm renting a
house near the lake

13:12.731 --> 13:16.331
I moved this morning and
it occurred to me to go

13:16.731 --> 13:17.329
Greet

13:17.631 --> 13:20.329
Well, hello John, I'm Silvia.

13:20.631 --> 13:22.329
And welcome to our neighborhood

13:22.631 --> 13:24.329
Thank you, I am very pleased to meet you

13:25.431 --> 13:27.996
I'm not interrupting anything, right?

13:29.431 --> 13:32.329
In fact, we have invited friends

13:32.431 --> 13:35.329
We were just going to sit down to dinner

13:35.431 --> 13:37.329
I go on business for
a few days tomorrow

13:37.431 --> 13:40.329
But maybe we can meet
again when I get back

13:40.431 --> 13:43.329
You come to the house and I'll cook you something.

13:43.431 --> 13:46.329
I'm not disastrous in the kitchen

13:48.431 --> 13:52.329
Excuse me, is that a
Mackezie you're wearing?

13:53.431 --> 13:55.663
Yes, how do you know?

13:56.431 --> 14:00.329
Well, I had an old girlfriend
who used to love that design

14:00.431 --> 14:02.329
I bought her a dress
from Mackezie in Milan

14:02.431 --> 14:04.329
You did it

14:05.431 --> 14:09.329
You, this is an assumption,
do you work in fashion?

14:09.431 --> 14:13.329
No, I just like being fashionable.

14:13.431 --> 14:15.329
You look amazing

14:15.431 --> 14:19.329
Not many women can use a Mackezie
without looking ridiculous

14:19.431 --> 14:21.329
Thank you

14:21.431 --> 14:25.329
Sincerely, to my new neighbors

14:26.431 --> 14:28.329
How kind of you

14:28.431 --> 14:31.329
Wait, I feel like
I've been a bit rude.

14:31.431 --> 14:34.329
Why do not you go and meet my husband?

14:34.431 --> 14:37.329
You have a drink with us

14:37.431 --> 14:39.329
Ok, just one

14:40.431 --> 14:41.329
All right

14:41.431 --> 14:43.329
And then I'll go out of your way and
leave you with your friends, I promise

14:43.431 --> 14:44.329
Enters

14:50.331 --> 14:52.329
This is John, our new neighbor.

14:52.531 --> 14:53.329
And this is Mark, my husband

14:53.531 --> 14:55.329
Nice to meet you

14:55.531 --> 14:57.329
He's just going to
join us for a drink.

14:57.531 --> 14:58.329
So is?

14:58.531 --> 14:59.329
Only one and I'll leave.

14:59.531 --> 15:01.329
Silvia explained that they have guests

15:01.531 --> 15:03.329
Is renting a house by the lake

15:03.531 --> 15:04.329
Yes, the Andersons

15:04.531 --> 15:05.329
Do not

15:05.531 --> 15:06.329
The Ands?

15:07.431 --> 15:08.329
Harry and Paula

15:08.531 --> 15:11.329
We adore them, they are so nice

15:11.531 --> 15:13.329
I did not know they were renting

15:13.531 --> 15:15.329
They are always away

15:26.580 --> 15:27.580
I present you

15:27.780 --> 15:30.329
This is John, our new neighbor.

15:30.529 --> 15:33.329
And John, these are Shean and Cristina

15:33.529 --> 15:34.329
Hello Cristina

15:34.529 --> 15:35.329
Hello

15:35.529 --> 15:36.329
Shean

15:36.529 --> 15:37.329
Sit down

15:37.529 --> 15:38.329
Thank you

15:41.529 --> 15:44.329
John brought this as a present

15:45.529 --> 15:49.329
Seriously, just your usual,
limited, thousand-dollar bottle

15:49.529 --> 15:50.329
Yes, it's a decent wine.

15:50.529 --> 15:52.329
I made a cocktail. Would you like to try it?

15:52.529 --> 15:53.329
Yes thanks

15:54.529 --> 15:57.329
Shean, honey. Can you reach for my purse?

15:57.529 --> 15:58.329
Shean

15:59.529 --> 16:02.329
It's there, thanks

16:21.529 --> 16:23.329
And American from now on

16:23.529 --> 16:26.329
I told you to learn Spanish, peresozo

16:26.529 --> 16:28.329
Ok its difficult

16:28.529 --> 16:31.329
Were you walking your dog or something?
Were you in the neighborhood?

16:31.529 --> 16:33.329
I do not have a dog

16:33.529 --> 16:36.441
No, I was looking for
somewhere quiet to rent

16:36.885 --> 16:38.329
And that really is

16:38.529 --> 16:40.329
Did you visit the village?

16:40.529 --> 16:41.329
I have not had time to see him

16:41.529 --> 16:44.329
It is so hidden. It is
full of quiet places

16:44.529 --> 16:47.329
And is a great place to raise children

16:47.529 --> 16:48.329
Basically, you can leave the doors

16:48.355 --> 16:50.329
Open at night. It's
like living in Canada

16:50.529 --> 16:51.329
OMG!

16:51.529 --> 16:53.552
Well, I do not plan on
having kids right now.

16:53.996 --> 16:57.329
You read my mind, we
just talked about it

16:57.996 --> 17:00.331
I like you John. What's your job?

17:00.552 --> 17:01.885
I am a consultant

17:03.552 --> 17:05.885
How are you, Shean? What do you do?

17:06.529 --> 17:10.663
I have finance at Windfield
Laboratories, Big Pharma

17:11.529 --> 17:12.885
You've probably heard of her.

17:13.218 --> 17:14.329
I know that company, of course.

17:14.330 --> 17:15.441
And you, Silvia, what are you doing?

17:15.551 --> 17:17.329
Well, I worked at the
Gougenheim for 5 years

17:17.551 --> 17:21.329
But now I am on a sabbatical
year, which is almost over

17:21.551 --> 17:23.329
And I'm looking to open an art gallery.

17:23.441 --> 17:24.329
I'm looking for investors

17:24.441 --> 17:25.329
You must call me

17:26.441 --> 17:28.329
How are you, Cristina?

17:28.441 --> 17:29.329
I studied Marketing and Advertising

17:29.441 --> 17:32.329
And right now I am with a
Master in Communication

17:32.441 --> 17:36.329
I always thought that
advertising fills expectations

17:36.441 --> 17:38.329
People do not want the
truth, they want hope

17:38.441 --> 17:40.329
All the people I
know just want money

17:40.441 --> 17:43.329
They want money to buy
things that give them hope

17:43.441 --> 17:45.329
And you Mark, what kind of work are you in?

17:45.441 --> 17:47.329
I'm a chemist with Shean, in the same firm

17:47.441 --> 17:50.329
Well, co-workers and friends too

17:50.441 --> 17:53.329
Interesting. I've never been one
of those who make friends at work

17:53.441 --> 17:55.774
Must have many common interests

17:56.331 --> 17:59.329
Statistically, at work is
where you make more friends

17:59.441 --> 18:01.329
Where did you say you consulted?

18:01.441 --> 18:04.329
Well, I've done my time on the
law market and the others

18:04.441 --> 18:07.329
I went where the money was

18:07.441 --> 18:08.329
I was traveling a lot

18:08.441 --> 18:12.329
Italy, Spain, Mexico, Costa Rica

18:12.441 --> 18:15.329
Costa Rica, I would love to go to Costa Rica

18:15.441 --> 18:18.329
What is it like to work in paradise?

18:18.441 --> 18:19.329
Damp

18:20.441 --> 18:23.329
The idea of paradise is much better
than reality, let me tell you.

18:23.441 --> 18:25.329
The imagination wins every time

18:25.441 --> 18:27.329
Waooh! So deep!

18:29.441 --> 18:33.329
I got tired of working for
other people, following orders

18:33.441 --> 18:37.329
I want to start my own
business, to be my own boss

18:37.441 --> 18:38.329
Well, my father always said

18:38.441 --> 18:40.329
It is better to be a big
fish in a small lake

18:40.441 --> 18:42.329
That a small fish in a big one

18:42.441 --> 18:43.329
Funny, my dad said the same thing.

18:43.441 --> 18:47.329
And one day a big fish passed and
swallowed him and his business

18:47.441 --> 18:50.329
Yes well, both parents are rare

18:50.441 --> 18:52.329
And I say that the ocean
waits for the brave

18:52.441 --> 18:55.329
Big and dark, the perfect place

18:55.441 --> 18:58.663
So that cowards find themselves

19:01.441 --> 19:04.329
You are a funny couple

19:04.441 --> 19:06.329
They do not look at all alike,
they have nothing in common

19:06.441 --> 19:10.329
In fact I would say that they
really do not fall so well

19:12.441 --> 19:15.329
So they do not have to pretend
to be friends to do what they do

19:15.441 --> 19:18.329
They can steal and steal and not be friends

19:18.441 --> 19:20.329
Who are you?

19:20.441 --> 19:21.329
I'm lost

19:21.441 --> 19:22.329
I also

19:22.441 --> 19:25.329
Your nose is bleeding.

19:29.441 --> 19:33.329
This cocktail is a Tom Collins, right?

19:33.441 --> 19:35.329
And at the same time is not a Tom Collins

19:35.441 --> 19:39.329
It's my Tom Collins, my version

19:39.441 --> 19:41.329
I just changed one ingredient

19:41.441 --> 19:43.329
Can you answer the fucking question?

19:43.441 --> 19:44.329
Shean

19:44.441 --> 19:45.329
Shean what?

19:45.441 --> 19:47.329
Are not you curious to
know about this guy?

19:48.441 --> 19:52.329
I give up. What is the
mysterious ingredient?

19:52.441 --> 19:55.329
I use kiwi juice instead of lemon

19:56.441 --> 19:59.329
Kiwi juice. What a find!

19:59.441 --> 20:01.441
Nobody gives a shit.
I asked you a question!

20:01.663 --> 20:03.329
Answer the fucking question

20:07.552 --> 20:09.329
Please sit down!

20:10.552 --> 20:12.774
You're an asshole. Do you realize that?

20:13.552 --> 20:16.329
Of course not, imbeciles never do

20:17.552 --> 20:20.329
I'm going to let you go, okay?

20:20.552 --> 20:21.329
All right

20:25.552 --> 20:31.329
Phones off at the table please

20:35.552 --> 20:39.329
Mine's in the room and it's off.

20:54.552 --> 20:56.329
It's true

20:56.552 --> 20:58.329
I always say the truth

21:04.552 --> 21:08.329
I do not intend to
harm any of you

21:08.552 --> 21:10.329
Unless I'm forced to

21:10.552 --> 21:12.329
I'm a pro, I do not want dramas

21:12.552 --> 21:16.329
Let's do this fast, let's
keep it good and simple.

21:16.552 --> 21:19.329
Now if you can be so nice to
bring me the money I came for

21:19.552 --> 21:23.329
I will leave now and can continue
with your pleasant evening

21:23.552 --> 21:26.329
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- We do not keep money in the house

21:26.552 --> 21:28.329
Tonight yes

21:28.552 --> 21:29.329
Can I smoke?

21:29.552 --> 21:30.329
Please

21:31.552 --> 21:32.329
There is no money

21:32.552 --> 21:35.329
What makes you think
we have money here?

21:35.552 --> 21:37.329
Yes, we have no idea what
you are talking about

21:37.552 --> 21:40.329
Mark Dudek, 34, married without children

21:40.552 --> 21:43.329
Although I think that
is about to change

21:43.552 --> 21:46.329
Middle-class conservative middle class

21:46.552 --> 21:49.329
Two older sisters, happy
childhood, good student

21:49.552 --> 21:52.329
Things got tough when your
father lost his business.

21:52.552 --> 21:54.329
But you worked hard

21:54.552 --> 21:57.329
You got a scholarship studying
chemical engineering in Brown

21:57.552 --> 21:58.329
Did you get married well

21:59.552 --> 22:03.329
An athlete, football player, climber, diver

22:03.552 --> 22:06.329
You started working at Windfield
Laboratories 5 years ago

22:06.552 --> 22:09.329
Promoted to Director of
Special Projects 3 years ago

22:09.552 --> 22:12.329
And you have not lost
a single moment since

22:12.552 --> 22:14.329
Mark, Shean Wells

22:15.552 --> 22:18.329
35 years old, single, divorced parents

22:18.552 --> 22:21.329
An older brother, difficult adolescence

22:21.552 --> 22:23.329
Problems at school at 14

22:23.552 --> 22:26.329
Stanford Economics graduate

22:26.552 --> 22:29.329
Your first job was bank
investor in the city

22:29.552 --> 22:32.329
Windfield Laboratories
hired you 3 years ago

22:33.552 --> 22:36.329
Very impressive. Everyone can use Google...

22:38.552 --> 22:41.329
What Google did not tell me
is that they are both players

22:42.552 --> 22:46.329
Two defenseless and
ambitious players players

22:46.552 --> 22:48.329
Who think they are smarter than all

22:48.552 --> 22:51.329
What I would call low class

22:52.552 --> 22:54.329
He's very brave for
a guy holding a gun

22:54.552 --> 22:56.329
I'm not holding a gun

22:57.552 --> 23:00.329
You have an incredible mind for
the figures but you are reckless

23:00.552 --> 23:02.329
I think Mark would agree with me on that.

23:02.552 --> 23:05.329
Because it was your idea to steal
from the company, was not it?

23:05.552 --> 23:07.329
That is what you are doing

23:07.552 --> 23:10.329
You are stealing information
from the company that

23:10.552 --> 23:13.329
Pay your salary and sell
it to the highest bidder

23:13.552 --> 23:15.329
And today is the payday

23:15.552 --> 23:19.329
So I think there's money
in the house, Silvia

23:20.441 --> 23:21.552
What are you talking about?

23:21.774 --> 23:23.329
I have no idea

23:23.552 --> 23:26.329
I have no idea what the
hell he's talking about

23:26.552 --> 23:29.329
Silvia does not know

23:33.552 --> 23:34.329
this is uncomfortable

23:34.552 --> 23:36.329
a little problem

23:36.552 --> 23:37.329
I'm going to the fucking bathroom

23:37.552 --> 23:40.329
You can make your own line.
We are all tolerant

23:40.552 --> 23:42.329
I do not think anyone cares

23:42.552 --> 23:44.329
I know that not me

23:51.552 --> 23:54.329
Well gentlemen, it's getting late

23:54.552 --> 23:58.329
I know everyone would prefer that I
go away to continue with their night

23:58.552 --> 24:00.329
The money please

24:01.552 --> 24:03.329
I told you, we do not have any money in the house.

24:03.552 --> 24:04.329
No money in the house

24:04.552 --> 24:06.329
You picked the wrong story,
you got the wrong address

24:06.380 --> 24:07.329
You have the wrong people

24:07.552 --> 24:09.329
I do not know where you got that story, but

24:09.552 --> 24:11.329
Shean and I never
bothered our company.

24:11.552 --> 24:13.329
We never steal information

24:13.552 --> 24:15.329
We never sold anything to anyone

24:18.552 --> 24:20.329
I'm going to give them 3 minutes

24:20.552 --> 24:21.329
For what?

24:21.441 --> 24:22.774
If the money is not here in that time

24:22.885 --> 24:25.329
I'm going to cut off Shean's
fingers one by one.

24:25.564 --> 24:26.317
Fuck, my fingers!

24:26.564 --> 24:28.317
I'll ask you this once

24:28.564 --> 24:29.317
This money he's talking about

24:29.564 --> 24:31.317
Is it here somewhere?
Is it in our house?

24:31.564 --> 24:33.317
Honey my love there's no money

24:33.564 --> 24:35.317
I do not know what you're talking about

24:36.564 --> 24:37.317
There is no money

24:39.564 --> 24:41.317
I know what you're asking right now.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.317
Are you fast enough
to grab that knife?

24:43.564 --> 24:46.317
If you were, what would you do?
Would you stab me in the heart?

24:46.564 --> 24:49.317
No, you would not, you would not do that

24:49.564 --> 24:51.317
Do you want to try your luck?
Want to see how fast you are?

24:51.564 --> 24:52.317
You do not want

24:53.564 --> 24:56.317
It would not be a fair fight,
the knife is closer to you

24:56.564 --> 25:00.317
That's right, it would not be fair at all

25:10.564 --> 25:12.317
Because I've killed before

25:12.564 --> 25:14.317
and you do not

25:20.564 --> 25:25.317
On the other hand, he has not crossed
in the mind of Shean the knife

25:25.564 --> 25:27.317
His eyes have not left the clock

25:27.564 --> 25:30.317
He wonders if I'm honest, if I'm really
going to cut his fingers one by one

25:30.564 --> 25:33.317
Or am I bluffing?

25:34.564 --> 25:36.317
We will find out soon

25:38.564 --> 25:40.317
I have 4 credit cards

25:40.564 --> 25:42.317
Silvia has a couple

25:42.453 --> 25:44.317
Shean four, six?

25:44.453 --> 25:46.317
We can put them together, let's go to an ITM

25:46.453 --> 25:49.317
We can get like $ 30
thousand between all

25:49.453 --> 25:51.317
$ 30 thousand

25:51.453 --> 25:52.317
Yes

25:52.453 --> 25:54.317
How are you, Cristina?

25:54.453 --> 25:57.317
Do you have a credit card?

25:57.453 --> 25:58.317
Yes one

26:00.453 --> 26:03.317
Yes, then that would make more than 30 thousand

26:03.453 --> 26:04.317
Can you reach 40?

26:04.453 --> 26:05.317
Definitely

26:05.453 --> 26:06.317
Yes Yes

26:07.453 --> 26:11.317
I'm not a fucking tourist

26:12.453 --> 26:15.329
And frankly it offends
me that you think it is

26:17.453 --> 26:20.317
You could have at least
offered me a transfer

26:22.453 --> 26:24.317
you are playing with me

26:25.453 --> 26:27.317
You are two children

26:27.453 --> 26:29.317
Small, very selfish

26:29.453 --> 26:32.317
Without consideration
for these amazing women

26:32.453 --> 26:33.317
What do they say to love

26:33.453 --> 26:37.317
If they had any respect they would
not be making it through this

26:38.453 --> 26:41.317
And the money would be here right now

26:44.453 --> 26:46.317
You're right-handed, right?

26:46.453 --> 26:48.317
What the hell does that have to do with this?

26:48.453 --> 26:50.317
Because I guess you'd
rather start on the left

26:50.453 --> 26:52.317
Do not say i'm not considered

26:54.453 --> 26:56.317
Sixty seconds left

27:04.331 --> 27:05.331
Tic-toc

27:05.453 --> 27:08.317
Tic-toc, tic-toc

27:11.453 --> 27:12.317
God

27:12.453 --> 27:13.317
Put your left hand on the table

27:13.453 --> 27:14.317
Fuck you

27:16.453 --> 27:18.317
Put your left arm at the fucking table.

27:18.453 --> 27:20.317
No no no

27:20.453 --> 27:24.317
- Fuck you - Calm
down, calm down.

27:24.453 --> 27:27.317
Are you going to sit there and see
how I rip your friend's fingers off?

27:27.453 --> 27:28.999
Well, they really are not
so friendly after all

27:29.001 --> 27:29.999
What the hell?

27:30.002 --> 27:30.999
Why is this my fault?

27:31.111 --> 27:31.999
Let's make a fucking deal

27:32.111 --> 27:33.888
I can get 100 thousand right now

27:35.001 --> 27:36.317
What do you have?

27:36.441 --> 27:38.317
I can get another hundred

27:38.441 --> 27:39.774
Those are 200 thousand, as soon as you open the bank

27:39.885 --> 27:40.999
We make the transfer and
it's yours and we're done

27:41.030 --> 27:42.329
I want my money now

27:42.388 --> 27:44.329
Tomorrow, what's the difference?

27:44.441 --> 27:46.329
Silvia, I'm so sorry that I'm going
to make a mess in your kitchen.

27:46.555 --> 27:47.999
Damn, it's in the basement.

27:48.441 --> 27:50.329
It is where?

27:50.441 --> 27:53.329
In the fucking basement, at the pool table

27:53.441 --> 27:54.329
Fuck

27:56.441 --> 27:57.329
Thank you

27:57.441 --> 27:59.329
What the hell?

28:02.441 --> 28:03.329
Cristina

28:04.441 --> 28:06.329
Can you please go get the
money and bring it here?

28:06.441 --> 28:08.329
And then we're done

28:09.441 --> 28:11.329
Where is the basement?

28:11.441 --> 28:14.329
It's by the door, next
to the refrigerator

28:18.441 --> 28:19.329
You lied to me?

28:20.441 --> 28:23.329
I asked you if there was money
in our house and you lied to me

28:23.441 --> 28:25.329
What did you want me to tell you?

28:25.441 --> 28:26.329
The truth

28:26.441 --> 28:28.329
We can not do this
now, the reality check

28:28.441 --> 28:32.329
Everything is not a fucking fantasy
land in the real world, Silvia

28:32.441 --> 28:34.329
Ok, no fucking Santa Claus

28:34.441 --> 28:37.329
I have to tell you that there
are no stores that sell babies

28:37.441 --> 28:39.329
Or fucking heaven on earth

28:41.441 --> 28:43.329
Well then

28:44.441 --> 28:47.329
Then everything he's been saying

28:47.441 --> 28:48.329
Is it all true?

28:49.441 --> 28:54.329
Have you been stealing company
secrets and selling them?

28:54.441 --> 28:55.329
Not now Silvia

28:55.441 --> 28:57.329
When? Why not now?

28:57.441 --> 29:00.329
You put me and all of us
in danger in our house

29:03.441 --> 29:04.329
How could you?

29:07.441 --> 29:09.329
Yeah, Mark, how could you?

29:42.441 --> 29:44.329
There she is

29:44.441 --> 29:46.329
You are imbeciles

29:46.441 --> 29:50.329
Why the hell did not they give him
the money when he asked for it?

29:51.441 --> 29:53.329
Shit, he was going to cut your fingers off

29:54.441 --> 29:55.329
Okay, sit down, fuck!

29:55.441 --> 29:56.329
Shean

29:57.441 --> 29:59.329
Do not be rude, say you're sorry

29:59.441 --> 30:00.329
Shean

30:04.441 --> 30:05.329
Sorry, fuck!

30:07.441 --> 30:08.329
very good

30:09.441 --> 30:11.329
Was there another suitcase in the basement?

30:11.441 --> 30:13.329
-No no

30:16.441 --> 30:17.329
Are you sure?

30:17.441 --> 30:18.329
Yes

30:20.441 --> 30:21.329
Just this one

30:21.441 --> 30:22.329
Yes

30:32.441 --> 30:34.329
So where's the rest of the money?

30:34.441 --> 30:35.552
That's all the fucking money

30:35.663 --> 30:37.329
No, no, this is half the money

30:37.441 --> 30:39.329
Your half, I would say

30:41.441 --> 30:45.329
Which means that half of
Mark is still missing

30:45.441 --> 30:47.329
That's all there is, is
telling the truth, I swear

30:47.441 --> 30:50.329
That's all there is

30:50.441 --> 30:52.329
2.5 million dollars, go.

30:53.441 --> 30:55.329
You know, when I was in Mexico I
spent a lot of time in the desert

30:55.441 --> 30:58.329
The only company I had
was the salamanders

30:58.441 --> 31:01.329
Let me tell you about the salamanders

31:01.441 --> 31:03.329
Beautiful creatures, amazing indeed

31:04.441 --> 31:07.329
If you cut the tail to
a salamander or legs

31:07.441 --> 31:09.329
Grow again in a matter of weeks

31:09.441 --> 31:12.329
And they can do that as
many times as they need

31:12.441 --> 31:14.329
I'm not a fucking salamander, man

31:14.441 --> 31:18.329
I can not grow my fingers and surely I can
not make money appear that I do not have

31:20.441 --> 31:22.329
Oh my God, no!

31:27.441 --> 31:29.329
He cut my finger

31:29.441 --> 31:31.329
He cut my fucking finger

31:32.441 --> 31:33.329
are you crazy

31:34.441 --> 31:36.329
Your index finger

31:36.441 --> 31:39.329
I just cut your index
finger to be precise

31:39.441 --> 31:40.329
Taking

31:40.441 --> 31:42.329
There is some ice there, put it there

31:43.441 --> 31:45.329
It's a clean cut

31:46.441 --> 31:48.329
Should be able to re-sew

31:48.441 --> 31:50.329
Now if someone is going
to take the missing money

31:50.441 --> 31:51.329
Permission

31:52.441 --> 31:56.329
I'll let you go to the hospital
and you can have them fixed

31:59.441 --> 32:02.329
Now that someone is going to
get the missing money, please

32:04.441 --> 32:06.329
Give me a cigarette

32:08.441 --> 32:11.329
Somebody give a guy a
cigarette bleeding too

32:12.441 --> 32:14.329
I do not smoke fuck!

32:15.441 --> 32:17.329
Because you left it?

32:18.441 --> 32:19.329
Mark

32:19.441 --> 32:20.329
Mark

32:21.441 --> 32:22.329
Yes

32:26.441 --> 32:27.329
The money

32:39.441 --> 32:41.329
Shit, fuck!

32:48.441 --> 32:49.329
Bastard!

32:52.441 --> 32:53.329
Shean

32:55.441 --> 32:56.329
Shean, finished

32:56.441 --> 32:57.329
Finished

33:17.336 --> 33:21.329
You're disappointed that Shean's
blood is not blue after all.

33:21.453 --> 33:24.329
My hopes were never so high

33:24.453 --> 33:26.329
I know what I got into

33:27.453 --> 33:28.329
All right

33:30.453 --> 33:32.329
Your skin is beautiful

33:34.453 --> 33:35.329
I know

33:37.453 --> 33:38.329
All right

33:40.453 --> 33:43.329
Do they know what they are doing?

33:43.453 --> 33:44.329
Do not

33:45.453 --> 33:46.329
Do not?

33:46.453 --> 33:49.329
No, I do not think they have any idea.

33:50.453 --> 33:55.329
The way I see it, you're the only one
here who knows what you're playing

33:57.453 --> 34:00.329
What should we do?

34:02.453 --> 34:03.329
What are we waiting for?

34:03.453 --> 34:06.329
Let's find a bucket of cold
water and let's fuck it

34:06.453 --> 34:07.329
To get you answers huh?

34:07.453 --> 34:09.329
You're not going to throw a bucket of water here

34:09.453 --> 34:10.329
Shean, Shean

34:11.453 --> 34:13.329
I want to go home

34:13.453 --> 34:15.329
Why? Everything is going so well

34:16.453 --> 34:20.329
Look, I do not know how you're going to handle this.

34:20.453 --> 34:22.329
But whatever you do, I
do not think you need me

34:22.453 --> 34:23.329
Is not that right honey?

34:23.453 --> 34:25.329
Honey, nobody planned this shit.

34:25.453 --> 34:28.329
I want to go to the hospital to fix
my fucking finger, so I can be okay

34:28.453 --> 34:29.329
But some things happened

34:29.453 --> 34:31.329
So why do not you sit, fuck!

34:31.453 --> 34:33.329
Until we fix this

34:33.453 --> 34:34.329
We have to call the police

34:34.453 --> 34:37.329
And tell them we sold information
for millions of dollars

34:37.453 --> 34:39.329
Or that we have a hostage in the house

34:39.453 --> 34:42.329
He is right. We're not
going to call the police.

34:43.453 --> 34:44.329
Keep calm

34:44.453 --> 34:45.329
Someone woke up

34:45.453 --> 34:46.329
Let's start

34:48.453 --> 34:51.329
Cristina, that was very brave of you.

34:52.453 --> 34:55.329
Yeah, that comes from a guy who pulled
a gun out of a bunch of unarmed women

34:55.453 --> 34:57.329
Also, let's get into it, come on.

34:57.453 --> 34:59.329
How did you know about John?

34:59.453 --> 35:00.329
Who else knows?

35:00.453 --> 35:02.329
Who do you work for?

35:02.453 --> 35:05.329
No one else knows, I work alone.

35:05.453 --> 35:08.329
We can leave the shit next, like
your story of the salamanders

35:08.453 --> 35:11.329
How did you know about the fucking money?

35:11.453 --> 35:12.329
The information is out there

35:12.453 --> 35:14.329
It's in the air, it's in the wind

35:14.453 --> 35:16.329
Just have to know

35:16.453 --> 35:17.329
How to grab it

35:17.453 --> 35:18.329
Still in the dark

35:18.453 --> 35:20.329
Its your fucking routine

35:20.453 --> 35:22.329
Why do not you talk in fucking English?

35:22.453 --> 35:23.329
Shean, Shean

35:23.453 --> 35:25.329
Let's be smart about this

35:26.453 --> 35:28.329
I will not wait any longer,
let's find out this

35:28.453 --> 35:29.663
What do we know about you?

35:29.885 --> 35:31.329
We know someone gave
you this information

35:31.453 --> 35:36.329
We know it's probably
Windfield or Delaware maybe

35:36.453 --> 35:40.329
And thanks to the adorable toys here we
are going to find out one way or another

35:40.453 --> 35:42.329
So why do not you tell
us the fucking truth?

35:42.453 --> 35:46.329
My God, you sound like a scratched record.
My head is going to explode

35:46.453 --> 35:49.329
Someone please bring
me a Paracetamol

35:49.453 --> 35:51.329
Are you having a bad day?

35:51.453 --> 35:52.329
Thanks Silvia

35:53.453 --> 35:55.329
Give him a massage too, dammit!

35:55.453 --> 35:57.329
You guys are fucked...

35:57.453 --> 35:58.329
Are you offering yourself?

35:58.453 --> 36:04.329
John, I'm going to hit you again and
again until you tell me the truth.

36:04.453 --> 36:05.329
Sure, I do not think so.

36:05.453 --> 36:07.329
Of course, because we are

36:07.453 --> 36:10.329
Undefined and ambitious little men

36:10.453 --> 36:14.329
Who is the lower class?
You are tied to a chair

36:14.453 --> 36:18.329
Nothing has changed. They are
still defenseless and ambitious

36:20.453 --> 36:25.329
I noticed that I did not receive medicine
when I was bleeding in your garden

36:26.996 --> 36:28.329
Are we so different?

36:28.453 --> 36:30.329
That is adorable

36:31.453 --> 36:34.329
You solve this bullshit

36:34.453 --> 36:37.329
How did you know that we...

36:38.996 --> 36:40.329
We wanted a baby

36:40.453 --> 36:42.329
We wanted? Why?

36:46.453 --> 36:48.329
Do not you want it any more?

36:51.453 --> 36:53.329
Silvia, you're a smart woman.

36:53.453 --> 36:56.329
You know that we scatter
our lives everywhere

36:56.453 --> 36:58.329
He hacked us

37:00.453 --> 37:02.329
He hacked our communications

37:02.453 --> 37:04.329
That's why he knows everything about us.

37:05.331 --> 37:07.329
More reason to kill
this bastard right now

37:07.453 --> 37:09.329
Look, I recognize that I have been arrogant

37:09.453 --> 37:11.329
And I have put them all in this

37:11.453 --> 37:14.329
Uncomfortable situation, it's my fault, but...

37:14.453 --> 37:17.329
It really is not so difficult
for us to solve it

37:17.453 --> 37:18.329
US

37:18.453 --> 37:20.329
The language has changed a bit, right?

37:20.453 --> 37:22.329
Now we are all on the same team

37:22.453 --> 37:24.329
No, it's you and us

37:24.453 --> 37:25.329
We are enemies. Do not you know that?

37:27.453 --> 37:28.329
Enemies

37:29.453 --> 37:31.329
You make it sound so dramatic

37:31.453 --> 37:33.329
Does it sound dramatic?

37:33.453 --> 37:34.329
Let's be dramatic.

37:34.453 --> 37:35.329
So what are we waiting for?

37:35.453 --> 37:37.329
How's the fucking truth?

37:38.453 --> 37:39.329
Put the gun down

37:39.453 --> 37:41.329
Lower the Shean Pistol

37:41.453 --> 37:43.329
What are we waiting for
with this piece of shit?

37:43.453 --> 37:45.329
I want to hear what you have to say

37:45.453 --> 37:47.329
Why are we so interested
in what he has to say?

37:47.453 --> 37:49.329
I apologize

37:51.453 --> 37:52.329
John

37:52.453 --> 37:54.329
What is your solution

37:55.453 --> 37:57.329
Finally thank you

37:58.453 --> 38:00.329
Really is very simple

38:01.453 --> 38:03.329
Untie me

38:04.453 --> 38:07.329
And I walk through that door
with that suitcase of money

38:08.453 --> 38:12.329
And they do not really see me
again as long as they live

38:12.453 --> 38:13.329
I promise

38:13.453 --> 38:15.329
That is an option

38:15.453 --> 38:17.329
I just want to clarify this then

38:17.453 --> 38:18.663
I do not want to make any mistakes

38:18.996 --> 38:20.329
We untie you

38:20.453 --> 38:22.329
We give you 2.5 million dollars

38:22.453 --> 38:24.777
That's enough? We give you
a ride to the bus station

38:24.888 --> 38:25.999
I'm actually being generous

38:26.009 --> 38:27.329
I'm just taking half the money

38:28.453 --> 38:31.329
It is fair what is the alternative?

38:34.453 --> 38:38.329
You give me your word
that if we untie you

38:38.453 --> 38:40.329
And we give you half the money

38:40.453 --> 38:43.329
Will you disappear for
the rest of our lives?

38:43.453 --> 38:46.329
Mark, I can not take this anymore.

38:46.453 --> 38:47.663
Or you shut up or I'll do it.

38:47.774 --> 38:49.329
You're crazy, fuck!

38:49.453 --> 38:51.329
You're the one who's crazy, asshole.

38:51.453 --> 38:52.774
You're passing a gun all over the place.

38:52.885 --> 38:54.329
At least I'm doing something fuck!

38:54.453 --> 38:56.329
You want to make a deal with him, you?

38:56.453 --> 38:58.329
Crazy, rich, high society bitch?

38:58.453 --> 39:00.329
- Sit down - Enough

39:00.453 --> 39:03.329
What are you doing?
Were not you out there?

39:03.453 --> 39:04.329
Yes

39:04.453 --> 39:05.329
Silvia, yes

39:07.453 --> 39:09.329
I give you my word

39:09.453 --> 39:10.329
That is worth a lot

39:10.453 --> 39:12.329
That's probably worth a finger

39:12.453 --> 39:13.329
at least

39:13.453 --> 39:14.329
Silvia, listen to me, okay?

39:14.453 --> 39:15.996
You trust me, right?

39:16.218 --> 39:16.830
I'm taking care of this

39:17.107 --> 39:18.329
I just need a minute to think

39:18.441 --> 39:21.329
Why do not they take 5 minutes?
Go to the bath

39:21.441 --> 39:24.329
I'll start with the interrogation,
I'll get some shit out of you.

39:24.441 --> 39:27.329
Can we get everything out? Just get everything

39:28.441 --> 39:32.329
Look, we have no guarantee that
you're going to keep your word.

39:32.441 --> 39:35.329
A minute ago, outside, you were acting

39:35.441 --> 39:38.329
Like a cold hearted psychopath

39:40.441 --> 39:44.329
And you know too much about
us, and that scares me

39:45.441 --> 39:47.329
So how do we know
if we let you go

39:47.441 --> 39:49.999
Are not you going to do anything or say anything?

39:51.222 --> 39:53.329
There is only one way

39:54.441 --> 39:58.111
And then you have to trust me

39:58.441 --> 40:00.329
How is this becoming
a fucking bargain?

40:00.441 --> 40:01.329
I said interrogation

40:01.441 --> 40:03.329
I do not think you're the
most lucid guy in the room

40:03.441 --> 40:05.329
You're actually paranoid

40:05.441 --> 40:07.329
And every time you go to

40:07.441 --> 40:09.329
Bathroom salts more paranoid

40:09.441 --> 40:13.329
So how about you sit down and leave
the conversation to the adults?

40:13.441 --> 40:16.329
Is this fucking paranoia?
This is paranoia, right?

40:16.441 --> 40:18.329
I do not have a fucking finger now

40:18.441 --> 40:21.329
Do you want guarantees to get out of this?

40:21.441 --> 40:23.329
How about I fuck this shit off
the face of the earth now?

40:23.441 --> 40:26.329
Are you going to disappear
from the face of the earth?

40:26.441 --> 40:28.329
What is going to fly into space?

40:28.441 --> 40:30.329
I said... the face of... that's not even...

40:30.441 --> 40:32.329
No, fuck, not out of space

40:34.107 --> 40:35.329
What if I just buried you?

40:35.441 --> 40:37.329
Burial, that's more possible.

40:38.441 --> 40:42.329
There is still a problem, someone in
fact would have to do it, kill me

40:42.441 --> 40:44.329
Would that be you?

40:44.441 --> 40:47.329
Yes, I think that would be me, except I
do not have to kill you with my hands...

40:47.441 --> 40:49.329
Except you do not have
the guts to kill anyone

40:50.441 --> 40:52.329
- Shean, Shean - What?

40:52.441 --> 40:54.329
For, what the hell are you doing?

40:55.441 --> 40:56.329
Mark

40:59.441 --> 41:00.329
What?

41:01.441 --> 41:03.329
Why?

41:03.441 --> 41:05.329
Our house is paid

41:06.441 --> 41:08.329
You made good money

41:09.441 --> 41:12.329
Why? Because you wanted to live in this one

41:12.441 --> 41:15.329
Perfect world where I
took care of everything

41:17.441 --> 41:18.329
I?

41:18.441 --> 41:19.329
Did you do it for me?

41:19.441 --> 41:20.663
Yes, of course I did it for you.

41:21.999 --> 41:23.829
Well, give it back, give it back

41:24.222 --> 41:25.329
It does not work like that

41:25.881 --> 41:29.329
I can not just give it back.
I would go to jail

41:29.555 --> 41:32.222
No, okay, I understand,
you sold information.

41:32.444 --> 41:35.111
Important to another pharmaceutical
company, am I right?

41:35.333 --> 41:36.888
Right. Industrial espionage

41:37.111 --> 41:39.001
Then you get a good lawyer.

41:39.111 --> 41:41.629
And then you give the money back

41:41.999 --> 41:45.555
And then tell them that they can not use
the information or you will sue them

41:45.888 --> 41:48.329
These Wall Street companies
do not want a scandal

41:48.881 --> 41:51.329
- It will be well
- My God, Jesus

41:51.441 --> 41:53.329
This is not the fucking lost and
found, you can not return it

41:53.441 --> 41:55.329
I am not talking to you

41:55.774 --> 41:57.329
You're talking to him,
you're talking to me.

41:57.441 --> 41:59.329
If this is wrong, I'm going to the fucking jail

41:59.441 --> 42:02.329
Not you, not you, that's our shit.

42:02.441 --> 42:04.329
It's my fucking money

42:04.441 --> 42:07.329
Silvia, you're an admirable woman,
but Mark is right about this.

42:07.441 --> 42:09.329
They can not just return the money

42:10.441 --> 42:13.329
I do not want to be involved in this

42:17.441 --> 42:19.329
I'm not going to give the money back

42:27.441 --> 42:29.329
Ok, you made your decision

42:30.441 --> 42:32.329
I go to my parents house

42:33.441 --> 42:35.329
I am going out of here

42:34.441 --> 42:35.552
Of course not, fuck, sit down

42:35.663 --> 42:37.329
Silvia, come back here right now.

42:37.441 --> 42:38.329
Or swear to god

42:38.441 --> 42:39.329
Or what?

42:39.441 --> 42:40.329
Or what? Do you want to find out?

42:40.441 --> 42:42.329
Are you saying that I can
not leave my own house?

42:43.441 --> 42:47.329
You're going to kill me? Are you going
to keep me in a chair like him?

42:48.441 --> 42:51.329
Can I talk to you privately in the kitchen?

42:51.441 --> 42:52.329
Thank you

42:52.441 --> 42:53.329
Shean, Shean

42:56.441 --> 42:58.329
- Hey. - What?

42:58.666 --> 43:01.329
This guy is a threat to both of us.
You understand that, right?

43:01.441 --> 43:02.888
No, I do not understand that

43:02.999 --> 43:05.329
Jesus, man. I'm going to
take you to a remote area

43:05.441 --> 43:06.663
And kill him with his own gun

43:06.774 --> 43:08.329
Ok, do not worry, I'll take
care of it, I can do it

43:08.441 --> 43:10.329
Silvia does not have to know anything

43:10.441 --> 43:12.329
Okay, tell him we'll let him go and

43:12.441 --> 43:15.329
We will drive you to a place far away

43:15.441 --> 43:17.329
As a precaution or something
to keep them safe

43:17.441 --> 43:19.829
Ok, and we will not need to
talk about it, it's over

43:20.111 --> 43:20.888
Simple and easy

43:21.111 --> 43:22.329
Are you talking seriously?

43:22.441 --> 43:24.329
Are you serious with all this?

43:24.441 --> 43:25.329
Yes, I'm serious.

43:25.441 --> 43:27.329
Want to die? Do you want to kill us?
Fuck!

43:27.441 --> 43:29.329
Did you find some way
we do not go to jail?

43:29.441 --> 43:30.329
I want to live, okay

43:30.441 --> 43:32.329
We have to get our hands dirty

43:32.441 --> 43:33.329
I already have them dirty

43:33.441 --> 43:37.329
Look, I think he told the truth
when he said he was alone.

43:37.441 --> 43:38.329
Let's try to negotiate...

43:38.441 --> 43:40.329
We already tried that, man.

43:40.441 --> 43:42.329
He brought this fucking
gun to negotiate with us.

43:42.441 --> 43:45.329
He knew it from the beginning

43:45.441 --> 43:47.329
If the type is connected
to Delaware or something

43:47.441 --> 43:52.329
We talked about a transfer
and they insisted on cash

43:52.441 --> 43:53.329
It was a fucking trap

43:54.441 --> 43:56.329
They paid us in cash
to steal our cash

43:57.441 --> 43:58.888
Do you know what is the best thing about being young?

44:02.441 --> 44:04.329
Do not feel paralyzed
by fear of consequences

44:05.441 --> 44:08.829
But it can also get us into trouble

44:09.441 --> 44:12.929
What are you planning to do with that money?

44:15.441 --> 44:18.329
What? Did you think anyone would notice?

44:19.441 --> 44:20.774
I guess it was not impossible

44:21.441 --> 44:23.329
So far, neither Shean nor Mark

44:23.441 --> 44:26.329
Have looked into that suitcase

44:27.441 --> 44:29.329
But eventually they will

44:30.441 --> 44:33.329
And then I'm afraid you'll be in trouble

44:34.441 --> 44:36.329
I do not know what you're talking about

44:36.441 --> 44:39.329
Cristina, Shean will
not be happy when

44:39.441 --> 44:42.329
Realize that his girlfriend has
been stealing money from him

44:42.441 --> 44:46.329
And for the short time
I spent with Shean

44:48.441 --> 44:51.329
I would say that it is
probably going to get violent

44:51.441 --> 44:55.329
If we offer you a million dollars to
take it or leave it, it will take

44:55.441 --> 44:57.329
And we just let it go

44:58.441 --> 44:59.999
It will not work, damn it!

45:00.441 --> 45:03.329
Look how easy it got to us.
It's in your house

45:03.441 --> 45:05.329
Do you want to give him a
million dollars and let him go?

45:05.441 --> 45:07.329
He's coming back, do you think it'll be nice?

45:08.441 --> 45:10.329
That's a risk I'll take

45:10.441 --> 45:11.329
That's a risk I'll never take

45:11.441 --> 45:12.329
That's my fucking money

45:12.441 --> 45:14.329
There is more where it came from

45:14.441 --> 45:16.329
There's no more, you closed
the fucking door, okay?

45:16.441 --> 45:17.329
Then we'll open another

45:17.441 --> 45:19.329
There is no way

45:22.441 --> 45:23.329
Mark, Mark, Mark

45:25.441 --> 45:28.329
I like you, I like your
spirit, you are brave.

45:30.441 --> 45:32.329
You got it

45:32.441 --> 45:34.329
The brave deserves his reward

45:36.441 --> 45:37.329
Think about it

45:37.441 --> 45:40.329
If I win, you win.

45:41.441 --> 45:43.329
But if I lose

45:43.441 --> 45:45.329
Well you lose too

45:47.441 --> 45:50.329
This is the only time in my life
that I have seen so much cash

45:50.441 --> 45:52.329
The only day of
our lives that we

45:52.441 --> 45:54.329
We have millions of dollars in cash

45:54.441 --> 45:56.329
And what do you do?

45:56.441 --> 45:58.329
You let a guy in by your
front door to steal it

45:58.441 --> 46:01.329
For real? Your wife wants to
cure her fucking migraines.

46:01.441 --> 46:03.329
You want to make sure he does not kill him.

46:03.441 --> 46:05.329
I'm the only one who gets hurt, fuck

46:05.441 --> 46:07.329
- You finished?
- Do not

46:07.441 --> 46:09.329
I think you guys are working together

46:09.441 --> 46:11.329
Enough Shean

46:11.441 --> 46:12.329
I do not know man

46:12.441 --> 46:14.329
I thought we were friends, man.

46:14.441 --> 46:18.329
I thought you and I were a team

46:18.441 --> 46:20.329
We are friends

46:21.441 --> 46:22.329
Show me

46:29.441 --> 46:32.329
Cristina was telling me all the
admirable qualities she sees in you

46:33.441 --> 46:36.329
You sound like a scratched record, man.

46:36.441 --> 46:39.329
You act sophisticated, clever and attractive

46:39.441 --> 46:41.329
But you're a fucking fraud

46:42.441 --> 46:47.329
You're just a guy with a gun
that lost a lot of money

46:47.441 --> 46:50.329
A girl with pepper
spray in her purse

46:52.441 --> 46:55.329
That's not going to look good on your resume.

46:56.441 --> 46:57.329
I am your husband

46:57.441 --> 47:00.329
I need you in this with
me tonight more than ever

47:01.441 --> 47:02.329
You know why?

47:03.441 --> 47:05.329
Because I love you

47:07.441 --> 47:10.329
I would never put you in
a situation like this

47:13.441 --> 47:15.329
I have to go

47:16.441 --> 47:18.329
You know what your problem is?

47:19.441 --> 47:21.329
You live in a glass bubble

47:22.441 --> 47:25.329
You have no idea how much
it costs to keep our style

47:27.111 --> 47:28.999
I was doing it for our family

47:29.441 --> 47:32.329
For our future

47:34.441 --> 47:37.329
Stealing is how you take care of your family?

47:40.441 --> 47:42.329
Ok agree

47:45.441 --> 47:46.329
I am sorry

47:47.441 --> 47:49.329
I will tell you the truth

47:50.441 --> 47:51.329
all the truth

47:55.441 --> 47:58.329
We have been living beyond our
means for a long time already

47:58.441 --> 48:01.329
And the time has come
to pay off debts

48:01.441 --> 48:03.329
Or they will take away everything

48:06.441 --> 48:09.329
What are you talking about?

48:11.441 --> 48:13.329
We are in debt

48:16.441 --> 48:19.329
I used the house as collateral
because I need the money

48:19.441 --> 48:22.329
To continue investing
and paying my debts

48:26.441 --> 48:33.329
Not only are we in
debt, we are bankrupt

48:37.441 --> 48:41.329
Did you use the house as collateral?

48:53.441 --> 48:56.329
I can not say this was
not an exciting day

48:56.441 --> 48:59.329
I think we will look back on this
adventure in a couple of days and just...

49:00.441 --> 49:01.329
Adventure?

49:03.441 --> 49:05.329
God, you're a fucking lunatic.

49:05.441 --> 49:07.329
Honey, you can relax, okay?

49:07.441 --> 49:09.329
I'm just trying to improve mood

49:09.441 --> 49:11.329
You do not have to be intimidated
by him anymore, okay?

49:11.441 --> 49:14.329
He's tied up like a fucking turkey, okay?

49:14.441 --> 49:15.774
He is not going anywhere

49:15.996 --> 49:18.329
I'll call a taxi, I'm going to my house

49:18.453 --> 49:20.329
You're not going to call anyone. Get off the phone!

49:20.453 --> 49:22.329
Are you trying to call a taxi?

49:22.453 --> 49:23.329
You are not going anywhere

49:23.453 --> 49:24.552
Give me my phone

49:24.774 --> 49:26.329
I'm not going to give you the phone obviously

49:26.453 --> 49:27.329
Give me my phone

49:27.453 --> 49:29.329
I'm not going to give you the fucking phone

49:29.453 --> 49:30.329
Shut your mouth

49:31.453 --> 49:33.329
You will have my full
attention in a moment

49:33.453 --> 49:36.329
- Wait a second - I'm walking

49:36.453 --> 49:38.329
You're not going anywhere.
What are you doing right now?

49:38.453 --> 49:41.329
It's a phone, I'll buy you a new one.

49:41.453 --> 49:42.329
It is my phone

49:42.453 --> 49:43.774
You threw it on the floor

49:44.107 --> 49:45.329
I will not trash your phone again

49:45.453 --> 49:46.774
OK sorry

49:47.107 --> 49:48.329
I'm a little stressed

49:48.453 --> 49:50.329
I do not know where my head was

49:50.453 --> 49:54.329
You know what your problem is, you
never know where your head is.

49:54.453 --> 49:57.329
Yeah, well, someone tried to steal everything
I got and cut my finger off, okay?

49:57.453 --> 49:59.329
And you should go to a hospital.

49:59.453 --> 50:00.329
But you do not want to go

50:00.453 --> 50:02.329
And I just want to go home

50:02.453 --> 50:04.329
Is that so hard to understand?

50:04.453 --> 50:06.329
I am not going to say anything

50:07.453 --> 50:10.329
I just want to get home
and get into bed, okay?

50:12.453 --> 50:13.329
You're right

50:15.453 --> 50:16.329
I am sorry

50:16.453 --> 50:19.329
I was going to tell you. I'm going to take you home

50:20.453 --> 50:23.329
I talked to Mark, we fixed it.

50:23.453 --> 50:27.329
I'm going to drive you somewhere far away

50:27.453 --> 50:33.329
Because if it is far away I will
feel safe knowing that you are safe

50:33.453 --> 50:35.329
That's what matters to me

50:35.453 --> 50:37.329
You are not safe here right now

50:38.453 --> 50:40.329
Let me work on this, i will fix it

50:41.453 --> 50:43.329
Okay, you're behaving very well

50:43.453 --> 50:45.329
Do not get angry with me now

50:45.453 --> 50:47.329
Be quick

50:50.453 --> 50:52.329
I'm going to get a fucking drink

50:53.453 --> 50:56.329
Shean, mine a Tom Collins
with extra kiwi juice

50:56.453 --> 50:59.329
Are not you going to stop teasing him?

50:59.453 --> 51:02.329
God, I thought you were smart.

51:03.453 --> 51:05.329
I'm sorry, I can not control myself

51:05.453 --> 51:07.329
It's just too fun

51:16.996 --> 51:21.001
Cristina, you know he's not going
to let you go anywhere, right?

51:21.222 --> 51:22.329
You know what's going to happen

51:22.453 --> 51:24.329
Shean has decided to kill me

51:24.453 --> 51:26.329
And the really sad thing
is that he thinks he can

51:26.453 --> 51:28.329
Because he has seen
too many bad movies

51:28.453 --> 51:31.329
He said he's probably going
to lead me into the woods

51:31.453 --> 51:33.329
And put a gun in my neck

51:33.453 --> 51:34.774
But it's my gun

51:34.996 --> 51:36.329
And one of the two
will end up dead

51:36.453 --> 51:38.329
And I assure you that it will not be me

51:38.453 --> 51:40.329
The only possibility that Shean has

51:40.453 --> 51:43.329
Is that you release me right now

51:45.453 --> 51:47.329
Shean lives and you take the money

52:09.453 --> 52:12.329
Listen, nobody's going to get hurt

52:12.453 --> 52:15.329
You get the money and you get out of here, okay?

52:15.453 --> 52:17.329
And no one will ever know

52:35.453 --> 52:37.329
Cristina, the knife, the
knife on the suitcase

52:38.453 --> 52:41.329
Cristina, I think some of the
pepper spray got into my eyes.

52:41.453 --> 52:43.329
You know? It burns

52:44.001 --> 52:46.777
Can you go to my car and
pick up the eye drops?

52:46.999 --> 52:47.449
The key

52:47.888 --> 52:49.329
You do not need it, it's open

52:50.453 --> 52:53.329
You do not need this, you're going back here.

52:57.453 --> 52:58.329
Yes

53:01.453 --> 53:02.329
Finally

53:03.453 --> 53:05.329
Where is my drink?

53:07.453 --> 53:09.329
You were not supposed to find out

53:09.453 --> 53:12.329
It was supposed to be temporary

53:13.453 --> 53:15.329
That's what we need the money for

53:15.453 --> 53:17.329
I'll ask my dad for the money.

53:18.453 --> 53:20.329
Your dad can not help

53:20.453 --> 53:22.329
He lost 10 times what I lost

53:23.001 --> 53:25.329
When we started to lose he
said we should stay strong

53:25.453 --> 53:31.329
That was the only way we would
win back the money we lost

53:31.453 --> 53:32.399
That's what he said

53:32.453 --> 53:35.329
That whoever lasts more would
end up winning the fortune

53:36.453 --> 53:37.329
But I was wrong

53:38.453 --> 53:40.329
We were all

53:41.453 --> 53:42.329
You're lying

53:42.453 --> 53:44.329
I wish it was

53:47.453 --> 53:51.329
You said you did all this for me before.

53:56.453 --> 53:59.429
That's the most lying thing
you've ever said in your life.

54:04.453 --> 54:06.829
You are a coward

54:11.453 --> 54:14.329
Have you decided what you will do with John?

54:16.453 --> 54:18.829
My plan is to negotiate with him

54:20.453 --> 54:23.829
See if he will settle for a
million dollars and let it go

54:30.453 --> 54:32.329
Do you think he'll leave us alone?

54:32.853 --> 54:33.899
I hope so

54:37.453 --> 54:39.829
It really does not make sense
to let him go with the money

54:40.453 --> 54:43.329
A minute ago you were okay with
letting him leave with all the money

54:44.453 --> 54:47.329
A minute ago I did not
know we were in bankruptcy

54:51.453 --> 54:54.329
What about Shean? He is a problem

55:00.453 --> 55:02.329
Leave me shean

55:02.453 --> 55:04.329
Today you said many interesting things

55:04.453 --> 55:06.329
Many of them true

55:08.453 --> 55:10.329
Imbecile, I am

55:10.453 --> 55:12.329
Ambitious, that's true

55:12.453 --> 55:14.329
But helpless? I dont know

55:19.453 --> 55:21.329
Undefined really bothered me

55:21.453 --> 55:23.329
That was for the finger

55:23.953 --> 55:24.829
Fair

55:26.453 --> 55:29.329
So technically I owe you

55:31.453 --> 55:35.329
If I remember correctly you were right-handed, right?

55:38.453 --> 55:40.329
I'm not going to be as kind as you

55:40.453 --> 55:43.329
So let's lose a couple of fingers

55:52.453 --> 55:53.329
What's going on?

55:52.453 --> 55:54.329
What did you do to Shean?

55:55.453 --> 55:56.329
Sit down!

55:59.453 --> 56:00.329
There

56:03.453 --> 56:05.329
Sit down!

56:12.453 --> 56:14.329
You too

56:16.453 --> 56:18.329
Please

56:32.453 --> 56:33.329
Shean

56:33.453 --> 56:34.329
Go Go

56:36.453 --> 56:38.329
Where are you taking it?

56:38.453 --> 56:41.329
Just relax. I'm just going to lock it up

56:48.453 --> 56:51.329
What happened? How did it unfold?

56:52.453 --> 56:54.329
How did it unfold?

56:54.453 --> 56:55.329
Who tied him?

56:56.400 --> 56:58.400
He's stoned, he must not
have done it very well.

56:58.453 --> 57:01.329
We should never have left
Shean alone with him

57:03.453 --> 57:04.329
What do we do?

57:04.453 --> 57:06.329
There are not many options left

57:06.453 --> 57:08.329
Where is your share of the money?

57:09.153 --> 57:10.329
In the safe

57:11.453 --> 57:13.329
Okay, we have to buy time

57:14.453 --> 57:16.329
Look, we had our chance.

57:17.111 --> 57:18.329
Shean annoyed him all

57:18.453 --> 57:20.329
Forget about Shean,
focus on the money

57:20.453 --> 57:22.329
Now you're worried about money

57:22.453 --> 57:23.329
To hell with money

57:24.453 --> 57:26.329
I just want that man
outside our house.

57:26.453 --> 57:29.329
No, if you let him go with the money,
it's not going to be your house anymore

57:29.453 --> 57:31.329
We will solve it
after it goes away

57:31.453 --> 57:33.329
No, you can not let it go

57:33.453 --> 57:35.329
What do you want me to do then?

57:35.453 --> 57:36.329
Get time

57:38.453 --> 57:39.329
Do you understand?

57:48.350 --> 57:50.414
Ok Mark, now it's your turn

57:58.107 --> 57:59.314
Let's find some money

57:59.350 --> 58:01.314
After You

58:27.441 --> 58:28.329
Combination

58:43.111 --> 58:44.329
What did you do?

58:44.441 --> 58:46.329
It is a security system

58:47.441 --> 58:50.329
Will not open again
for the next 8 hours

58:57.441 --> 59:00.329
Now you're really
making me angry

59:18.950 --> 59:19.914
Then Mark

59:20.453 --> 59:22.329
I heard you're a diver

59:23.453 --> 59:24.329
good...

59:25.453 --> 59:26.329
let's see...

59:27.453 --> 59:28.329
What are you made of

59:44.453 --> 59:46.329
You are wasting your oxygen

59:47.453 --> 59:49.329
Start focusing on
what really matters

59:49.453 --> 59:51.329
For once in your life

01:00:42.453 --> 01:00:43.329
There you are

01:00:48.453 --> 01:00:50.329
How do you feel about dying for money?

01:00:50.453 --> 01:00:51.329
You killed him

01:00:52.453 --> 01:00:54.329
You will kill us all

01:00:54.453 --> 01:00:56.329
No, Shean bothered me

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:59.329
That became personal

01:01:00.453 --> 01:01:03.329
So you're going to open the safe for me?

01:01:03.453 --> 01:01:04.329
I can not

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:07.329
Once it is locked there
is nothing to do

01:01:07.453 --> 01:01:09.329
Except wait

01:01:17.453 --> 01:01:18.329
I think

01:01:19.453 --> 01:01:21.329
But now you have a decision to make

01:01:22.453 --> 01:01:23.329
It's very simple

01:01:24.453 --> 01:01:27.888
Your money or your life

01:01:28.453 --> 01:01:31.329
You can have the money,
you can have it all

01:01:31.453 --> 01:01:34.329
The box will not open for another 8 hours

01:01:37.453 --> 01:01:38.329
8 hours

01:01:41.453 --> 01:01:44.329
I'm not a patient man, Mark.

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:47.329
Get up

01:01:55.453 --> 01:01:56.329
Get up

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:29.329
Okay

01:02:33.453 --> 01:02:34.329
Get in there

01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:01.350
Good...

01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:04.350
It seems we have some time to kill

01:03:04.453 --> 01:03:05.996
Where is Shean?

01:03:06.453 --> 01:03:07.996
Do not worry. He's fine

01:03:08.453 --> 01:03:09.996
Both are fine

01:03:16.453 --> 01:03:17.329
Great title

01:03:18.453 --> 01:03:19.329
It's a great book

01:03:19.453 --> 01:03:23.329
My favorite Velho has
always been Humble Gift

01:03:24.453 --> 01:03:25.329
Do you like Old?

01:03:25.453 --> 01:03:26.329
He's fine

01:03:28.453 --> 01:03:29.329
He is not only well

01:03:29.453 --> 01:03:30.329
is one of the best

01:03:31.453 --> 01:03:33.329
Well... that's a matter of opinion

01:03:33.453 --> 01:03:35.329
No, that's a fact.

01:03:39.453 --> 01:03:41.329
So you're right and I do not

01:03:41.453 --> 01:03:42.329
Yes

01:03:46.453 --> 01:03:47.329
But...

01:03:48.453 --> 01:03:50.329
I am the one with the gun

01:03:54.453 --> 01:03:56.329
Literature is not a matter of taste

01:03:56.453 --> 01:03:58.329
It's a matter of talent

01:03:58.453 --> 01:04:01.777
Ok please

01:04:03.453 --> 01:04:04.329
Ahead

01:04:04.453 --> 01:04:06.800
The world needs great literature

01:04:07.453 --> 01:04:10.329
People who read great
literature become wise

01:04:10.453 --> 01:04:12.329
And wise men make good men

01:04:14.453 --> 01:04:18.329
It is difficult enough to become wise if
you do not understand what you are reading

01:04:27.453 --> 01:04:30.729
I bet you would be a great nurse

01:04:33.153 --> 01:04:35.329
I'm afraid your husband
has complicated things

01:04:35.453 --> 01:04:38.329
Activating a safety
mechanism in the safe

01:04:38.453 --> 01:04:40.329
Will not open for another 8 hours

01:04:41.453 --> 01:04:43.329
That was reckless of her

01:04:43.453 --> 01:04:45.329
A gesture of little
talent, I assure you

01:04:46.453 --> 01:04:48.329
You will not know
anyone who can open it

01:04:49.453 --> 01:04:51.329
No, I do not even know the combination

01:04:52.453 --> 01:04:53.329
Due to Mark's paranoia

01:04:53.453 --> 01:04:54.444
He changes it every week

01:04:55.555 --> 01:04:58.329
I will not learn a lot of
new numbers every week

01:05:01.453 --> 01:05:03.329
No, I do not think so.

01:05:04.453 --> 01:05:06.329
What time does the housekeeper arrive?

01:05:06.453 --> 01:05:07.329
At 9

01:05:09.453 --> 01:05:11.329
And the gardener?

01:05:11.453 --> 01:05:12.329
He does not work tomorrow

01:05:13.453 --> 01:05:15.329
No, he works on Fridays.

01:05:16.453 --> 01:05:17.329
True

01:05:21.453 --> 01:05:23.329
Do you really never lie?

01:05:26.453 --> 01:05:28.329
But everyone lies

01:05:28.453 --> 01:05:31.329
Life would be impossible without the lies

01:05:32.453 --> 01:05:33.329
It would be better

01:05:34.453 --> 01:05:36.329
Rather, more cruel

01:05:38.453 --> 01:05:40.329
I think you need points

01:05:40.453 --> 01:05:42.329
I also believe it

01:05:43.453 --> 01:05:44.329
O will become infected

01:05:45.453 --> 01:05:48.329
Just clean it and cover it
and it will be fine for now.

01:05:50.453 --> 01:05:51.329
Agree

01:05:54.453 --> 01:05:56.329
This is going to hurt

01:06:04.453 --> 01:06:06.329
You're a very special woman

01:06:07.453 --> 01:06:09.329
You do not really know me

01:06:10.453 --> 01:06:12.888
You are educated, intelligent

01:06:13.353 --> 01:06:14.329
Elegant

01:06:15.453 --> 01:06:17.329
But any fool can see that

01:06:19.453 --> 01:06:21.829
Your favorite writer is
not Old Scott Fitzgerald

01:06:22.453 --> 01:06:24.329
Your passion is art

01:06:24.453 --> 01:06:26.329
Your favorite painter Pollock,

01:06:26.453 --> 01:06:28.329
Gauguin, El Greco

01:06:29.453 --> 01:06:32.329
You have high hopes
with your art gallery

01:06:32.453 --> 01:06:34.329
Do you like the beach but not the sea

01:06:35.453 --> 01:06:37.329
Your favorite food is sushi

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:42.329
You have scary eyes and you're going to hate
me for this, but you're a bit arrogant.

01:06:44.453 --> 01:06:47.329
It's not arrogance, it's security.

01:06:49.453 --> 01:06:51.329
Okay then

01:06:52.453 --> 01:06:53.829
You adore children

01:06:54.453 --> 01:06:56.329
You're going to be a wonderful mother.

01:06:57.453 --> 01:06:59.329
I'm not so sure about Mark

01:07:01.453 --> 01:07:04.329
Why did not you tell him yet?

01:07:08.453 --> 01:07:10.329
I was saving it for his birthday.

01:07:11.453 --> 01:07:13.329
It was going to be a surprise

01:07:16.453 --> 01:07:18.329
Things have changed

01:07:21.453 --> 01:07:22.329
Yes

01:07:22.453 --> 01:07:23.929
They've changed

01:07:28.453 --> 01:07:30.329
What do you really like?

01:07:33.453 --> 01:07:36.329
You mean other than
being a tough guy?

01:07:41.853 --> 01:07:42.829
I dont know

01:07:44.331 --> 01:07:48.930
You look like maybe
you had talent

01:07:49.453 --> 01:07:51.730
But you do this with your life

01:07:53.453 --> 01:07:54.999
Why not?

01:07:56.453 --> 01:07:57.730
Because it is not the right thing

01:08:00.453 --> 01:08:03.730
Stealing thieves is not the right thing to do?

01:08:05.453 --> 01:08:08.730
Is that what you do? Steal thieves?

01:08:15.453 --> 01:08:18.328
Why did not you ever ask me
if your husband was okay?

01:08:20.453 --> 01:08:22.328
I know it's ok

01:08:22.453 --> 01:08:25.218
He has not opened the safe and
you need the open box, right?

01:08:25.453 --> 01:08:31.218
Well, I could bring the dynamite I
keep in the trunk and exploit it

01:08:34.453 --> 01:08:36.328
You are not the type of dynamite

01:08:36.453 --> 01:08:38.328
I think you're looking

01:08:40.453 --> 01:08:42.328
So you're going to wait

01:08:46.453 --> 01:08:49.328
2.5 million, this is the fat prize

01:08:51.453 --> 01:08:55.328
No, 5 million dollars

01:08:56.453 --> 01:08:58.328
That's the fat prize

01:10:40.453 --> 01:10:41.329
It's time

01:10:54.453 --> 01:10:55.329
Hi. Hello

01:10:56.453 --> 01:10:57.996
Someone help me

01:10:58.218 --> 01:10:59.329
Somebody help me get out of here

01:11:01.453 --> 01:11:01.885
Hello?

01:11:01.996 --> 01:11:03.329
I'm down here in the basement

01:11:03.552 --> 01:11:05.329
Mr. Dillon, what are
you doing down there?

01:11:06.552 --> 01:11:08.774
Please please please.
It does not matter

01:11:09.453 --> 01:11:10.663
- We have to leave -
Is Sylvia with you?

01:11:10.774 --> 01:11:12.329
Yes Yes.
We need your help

01:11:12.453 --> 01:11:16.329
Get down here to the basement
please, I have to go by Silvia

01:11:18.453 --> 01:11:19.774
Where is she?

01:11:28.453 --> 01:11:30.329
I'm going to go get Mark

01:11:38.453 --> 01:11:40.329
- Here it comes - It's okay.

01:11:40.453 --> 01:11:42.329
Hurry up, go!

01:12:02.453 --> 01:12:03.329
Good Morning

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:05.329
Come with me

01:12:07.453 --> 01:12:08.329
I said let's go

01:12:09.453 --> 01:12:10.329
Do not

01:12:11.453 --> 01:12:12.329
Sorry?

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:13.329
I said no

01:12:17.331 --> 01:12:18.552
You got to be kidding

01:12:18.663 --> 01:12:21.329
I thought we had already gone through this

01:12:22.453 --> 01:12:24.829
I'm starting to lose
patience with you

01:12:25.453 --> 01:12:27.329
Do you want me to get my gun back?

01:12:28.453 --> 01:12:31.329
Are you going out right now or
will I shoot you in the knee?

01:12:31.453 --> 01:12:34.329
First your right knee
and then your left knee

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:38.329
Carl

01:12:39.453 --> 01:12:41.329
Your husband told me about the thief.

01:12:41.453 --> 01:12:43.329
- Did you talk to Mark?
- Yes, it's in the basement.

01:12:43.453 --> 01:12:45.329
Look at you, all tied up

01:12:47.453 --> 01:12:48.329
Oh God

01:12:51.453 --> 01:12:54.329
- No no no. Wait to? Do you
want me to call the police?

01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:57.329
- No no. Without police
- Without police?

01:12:57.453 --> 01:12:58.329
Why without police?

01:12:58.453 --> 01:13:00.329
Carl, I need you to trust me.

01:13:02.453 --> 01:13:03.329
Three seconds

01:13:07.453 --> 01:13:08.329
Good Guy

01:13:19.453 --> 01:13:22.329
Come on, that's a good boy.

01:13:26.453 --> 01:13:29.329
- Silvia Are you okay?
- If I am fine

01:13:52.453 --> 01:13:53.329
You have a chance

01:13:53.453 --> 01:13:56.829
Or the box opens at the
first or I blow your brains

01:14:14.453 --> 01:14:16.329
Open the suitcase

01:14:18.453 --> 01:14:20.329
Put the money in the suitcase

01:14:21.453 --> 01:14:23.329
Put the money in

01:14:38.453 --> 01:14:40.329
so that's all

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:52.329
Sit down

01:14:53.453 --> 01:14:55.329
And Shean?
Mark?

01:14:55.953 --> 01:14:56.829
Hands

01:15:01.453 --> 01:15:04.329
6'2 ", blonde hair, cropped, style

01:15:04.453 --> 01:15:06.329
Military, with Eastern European accent

01:15:07.453 --> 01:15:10.329
It weighs about 220 pounds

01:15:10.453 --> 01:15:12.329
Dress, casual, blue jeans,

01:15:12.453 --> 01:15:14.329
Dark T-shirt and sneakers

01:15:14.453 --> 01:15:16.329
Scar, on his right cheek

01:15:17.453 --> 01:15:19.329
That is the description
they will give the police

01:15:20.653 --> 01:15:22.829
Are you happy about that, Mark?

01:15:23.453 --> 01:15:25.329
- Yes - Good

01:15:35.453 --> 01:15:38.329
I'm sorry, this should
have been much simpler.

01:15:38.453 --> 01:15:41.329
Enter, take the money
and leave immediately

01:15:42.453 --> 01:15:43.329
I'm usually very good at my job

01:15:43.453 --> 01:15:45.829
Help will come soon,
they will untie them

01:15:46.453 --> 01:15:48.829
Silvia, Cristina...

01:15:49.453 --> 01:15:51.663
I wish you the best of luck
for the rest of your lives

01:15:51.996 --> 01:15:53.329
Where is Shean?

01:15:55.453 --> 01:15:57.329
You are a fucking liar

01:15:58.453 --> 01:16:01.929
No problem, it's been a pleasure

01:16:53.453 --> 01:16:55.329
- And he did that, right?
- Right

01:16:56.453 --> 01:16:58.329
And the description of the assailant?

01:16:59.453 --> 01:17:02.329
6'2 ", over 220 lbs.

01:17:02.453 --> 01:17:04.329
Short hair, military style

01:17:05.453 --> 01:17:08.329
I had an accent from Western Europe...

01:17:09.453 --> 01:17:12.329
He was dressed in casual, blue
jeans, dark T-shirt... sneakers

01:17:12.453 --> 01:17:14.329
Scar over his right eye

01:17:15.453 --> 01:17:18.929
He had a scar on his right cheek

01:17:20.453 --> 01:17:23.329
His right cheek or
his left cheek?

01:17:23.453 --> 01:17:26.329
- Right - Your right cheek

01:17:26.453 --> 01:17:27.329
Yes

01:17:32.453 --> 01:17:33.329
sorry

01:17:36.453 --> 01:17:39.329
I've been waiting to get out
of here, I have to go home

01:17:39.453 --> 01:17:40.329
Can I take a taxi?

01:17:40.453 --> 01:17:42.829
There are no problems, I can have
one of my officers accompany you

01:17:43.153 --> 01:17:44.329
Thank you very much

01:17:45.453 --> 01:17:46.329
Yes sir

01:17:50.453 --> 01:17:52.329
- Please thank you very much

01:19:06.453 --> 01:19:07.329
I'm going

01:19:12.453 --> 01:19:15.329
I will send someone for the
rest of my stuff in a few days

01:19:16.453 --> 01:19:18.329
What are you talking about?

01:19:19.453 --> 01:19:21.329
I just got out of the bubble

01:19:22.453 --> 01:19:24.329
I'm going to divorce you

01:20:16.453 --> 01:20:18.329
- Hello Hello

01:20:19.111 --> 01:20:19.999
Here you have

01:20:31.123 --> 01:20:32.999
What is this?

01:20:33.123 --> 01:20:34.999
A gift

01:20:35.123 --> 01:20:37.999
Are you trying to buy me?

01:20:38.123 --> 01:20:40.999
Not me...
I want...

01:20:41.123 --> 01:20:42.999
You do not have to explain anything to me

01:20:43.123 --> 01:20:46.999
And you do not have to buy me, you're safe.

01:20:48.123 --> 01:20:51.999
- I'm sorry, I did not mean to offend you...
- No no no no

01:20:52.123 --> 01:20:54.999
I want you to have this, you deserve it.
You helped me

01:20:55.123 --> 01:20:56.999
No, I did not do it

01:20:57.123 --> 01:20:59.999
- Yes, he did - No

01:21:00.123 --> 01:21:01.999
Thursdays are my days off

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:04.999
I was not even in the house, I
do not know what happened there

01:21:05.123 --> 01:21:06.999
And not...
I do not want to know

01:21:07.123 --> 01:21:09.999
Please. Would you take it as a gift?

01:21:10.123 --> 01:21:12.999
A farewell gift?

01:21:15.123 --> 01:21:18.999
- It goes?
- Yes

01:21:23.123 --> 01:21:25.999
I think this is the first
time I see him smile

01:21:26.123 --> 01:21:27.999
Yes

01:21:28.123 --> 01:21:31.999
I think what makes
me smile is refuse

01:21:32.123 --> 01:21:34.999
To that pile of money and
feel happy about that

01:21:37.123 --> 01:21:37.999
Are you sure?

01:21:38.123 --> 01:21:40.999
Yes. I could get used to that.

01:21:43.123 --> 01:21:44.999
It's okay

01:21:50.123 --> 01:21:55.999
- Thank you for showing me your move
- It was a pleasure

01:22:01.123 --> 01:22:02.999
Be good

01:22:03.123 --> 01:22:05.999
You too
