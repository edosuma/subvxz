00:12.445 --> 00:16.973
(people chanting)

00:21.120 --> 00:25.318
(chanting continues)

00:42.675 --> 00:48.443
(gunshots)

00:49.682 --> 00:51.317
"Wherever you live
is your temple

00:51.317 --> 00:52.652
if you treat it
like one."

00:52.652 --> 00:54.153
State your source.

00:54.153 --> 00:55.287
Buddha.

00:55.287 --> 00:56.889
Paramedics just pronounced.

00:56.889 --> 00:58.224
Four dead, no witnesses.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.158
Coroner's on his way.

00:59.158 --> 01:01.394
Guy in the robe flagged down
an officer.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.963
"Guy in the robe"
is a monk, Nick.

01:03.963 --> 01:05.931
Yeah? Well...

01:06.999 --> 01:08.334
he's a quiet monk.

01:08.334 --> 01:10.393
Nonnative, from Thailand.

01:19.612 --> 01:22.181
Rug's low pile, smooth.

01:22.181 --> 01:24.550
I'll try to dust lift.

01:24.550 --> 01:25.885
Okay.

01:25.885 --> 01:28.752
Let's hug the walls.

01:34.093 --> 01:35.995
(Grissom sighs)

01:35.995 --> 01:38.631
Gunshot to the head.

01:38.631 --> 01:40.360
Times four.

01:49.575 --> 01:53.546
Gold statues...

01:53.546 --> 01:54.380
money trees...

01:54.380 --> 01:56.483
That's a lot of loot
to leave behind.

01:56.482 --> 01:59.452
This wasn't a robbery.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.317
This was a hit.

02:17.636 --> 02:20.406
Five years ago, West Vegas...

02:20.406 --> 02:23.275
German tourist took
a wrong turn, ended up dead.

02:23.275 --> 02:24.343
This placa
was sprayed

02:24.343 --> 02:27.246
across the windshield
of their rental car.

02:27.246 --> 02:28.881
It's the Snakebacks.

02:28.881 --> 02:32.112
Gangbangers?
At a Buddhist temple?

02:33.152 --> 02:34.881
Stippling around entry.

02:37.123 --> 02:38.557
Close range.

02:38.557 --> 02:41.193
Looks like they were shot
one at a time.

02:41.193 --> 02:42.862
How do you
get one vic...

02:42.862 --> 02:44.630
let alone four... to sit still

02:44.630 --> 02:48.000
while you put a bullet
between their eyes?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.069
They were praying.

02:50.069 --> 02:51.303
Yeah, for mercy.

02:51.303 --> 02:53.939
For whoever was shooting them.

03:26.672 --> 03:30.403
(siren blares in distance)

04:07.446 --> 04:10.783
What can you tell me
about the victims?

04:10.783 --> 04:12.218
We came from Thailand

04:12.218 --> 04:14.420
to share Buddhism
here in Nevada.

04:14.420 --> 04:18.423
But you didn't share
the last couple hours together.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.226
Where were you?

04:20.226 --> 04:21.160
I was at the bank.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.263
We're raising money
to build a school.

04:24.263 --> 04:27.099
I was making
a deposit.

04:27.099 --> 04:29.468
Where are
the other monks?

04:29.468 --> 04:30.636
On a retreat.

04:30.636 --> 04:33.272
They come
back tomorrow.

04:33.272 --> 04:34.740
May I ask a question?

04:34.740 --> 04:37.076
This is
a high-crime area.

04:37.076 --> 04:40.212
Have you had
any problems here before?

04:40.212 --> 04:42.882
Like break-ins or burglaries?

04:42.882 --> 04:44.817
The past...

04:44.817 --> 04:46.952
is in the past.

04:46.952 --> 04:48.020
True.

04:48.020 --> 04:53.014
But, sometimes, it leaves
its fingerprints on the future.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.706
Aren't you on duty?

05:07.706 --> 05:08.774
Hey.

05:08.774 --> 05:09.708
Hey.

05:09.708 --> 05:10.843
How you doing,
kiddo?

05:10.843 --> 05:12.678
Okay. How are you?

05:12.678 --> 05:15.347
Fine. Sit.

05:15.347 --> 05:16.782
Whew.

05:16.782 --> 05:18.517
Attitude adjustment?

05:18.517 --> 05:20.019
For the wife.

05:20.019 --> 05:22.588
Says she can't face me
without it.

05:22.588 --> 05:25.724
Ah. How is Mrs. Tadero?

05:25.724 --> 05:28.694
Counting the days
till I retire.

05:28.694 --> 05:31.530
Nice job on the Logan case.

05:31.530 --> 05:32.531
Oh.
Hoo-hoo!

05:32.531 --> 05:34.433
Wild ride!
Mm-hmm.

05:34.433 --> 05:35.868
You did good.

05:35.868 --> 05:37.236
Yeah?
Yeah.

05:37.236 --> 05:39.605
Well...

05:39.605 --> 05:41.698
I
had
a good teacher.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.714
(sighing)
So, did
you
see it?

05:48.714 --> 05:49.848
The confession?

05:49.848 --> 05:50.816
On TV, yeah.

05:50.816 --> 05:52.384
And what do you think?

05:52.384 --> 05:54.787
I always regretted the jury
didn't give him the chair.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.622
But I'll take cancer,
long as he's gone.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.457
I've made a lot of mistakes.

05:58.457 --> 06:01.593
I killed that guy in Reno.

06:01.593 --> 06:06.065
But I did not kill
Stephanie Watson.

06:06.065 --> 06:07.099
(panting)

06:07.099 --> 06:11.263
God is my witness,
I did not kill her.

06:12.471 --> 06:13.339
Deathbed denial.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.975
Negotiate with God
for a better seat in hell.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.077
What if Kelso
didn't kill Stephanie?

06:18.077 --> 06:21.706
I looked him in the eyes
15 years ago. He did it.

06:24.984 --> 06:27.475
(screaming)

06:30.723 --> 06:31.657
(sighs)

06:31.657 --> 06:33.092
What if he didn't?
I mean...

06:33.092 --> 06:36.495
Witnesses saw him bothering her
in the club that night.

06:36.495 --> 06:39.131
Uniform picks him up
a block from the alley.

06:39.131 --> 06:40.833
Knife cut on his hand.
Come on, Cath!

06:40.833 --> 06:45.270
Well... maybe I'm just afraid,
if I accept that he killed her,

06:45.270 --> 06:48.107
that it's over,
and Stephanie's really dead.

06:48.107 --> 06:50.803
I...I don't know.

06:53.545 --> 06:55.614
What never lies?

06:55.614 --> 06:57.016
(sighs)

06:57.016 --> 06:59.814
The evidence.

07:00.452 --> 07:02.755
The statute says that,
once the convicted party

07:02.755 --> 07:06.458
is executed or dies,
the evidence can be destroyed.

07:06.458 --> 07:07.259
It... it's not here.

07:07.259 --> 07:09.194
Relax. They said
it'd be here.

07:09.194 --> 07:11.397
Yeah, well,
people make mistakes.

07:11.397 --> 07:16.035
Well, that's why we
have computer tracking.

07:16.035 --> 07:17.169
Fourteen...

07:17.169 --> 07:19.171
It was 15, right?

07:19.171 --> 07:20.729
Yeah.

07:22.541 --> 07:24.043
Stephanie Watson, right?

07:24.043 --> 07:25.704
Yeah.

07:27.813 --> 07:30.543
Yeah, that's it.

07:34.653 --> 07:37.623
This was my old life.

07:37.623 --> 07:38.657
Yeah?

07:38.657 --> 07:41.558
We all have a past, huh?

07:46.265 --> 07:48.600
Stephanie was my best friend.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.936
Hey, we still on for tonight?

07:50.936 --> 07:51.770
I got a gig.

07:51.770 --> 07:54.273
I promised him I'd be there.
Forgive me?

07:54.273 --> 07:55.674
Just this once.

07:55.674 --> 07:58.666
I never saw her again.

08:02.247 --> 08:05.350
What exactly are we looking for?

08:05.350 --> 08:06.185
(sighs)

08:06.185 --> 08:08.813
Peace of mind
that they got the killer.

08:10.089 --> 08:13.581
Well, I'd start with this.

08:15.094 --> 08:17.596
(man speaking
foreign language)

08:17.596 --> 08:18.530
Forgive me.

08:18.530 --> 08:20.966
English is my second language.

08:20.966 --> 08:22.468
I understand you fine.

08:22.468 --> 08:25.104
So, you're
the part-time cook here?

08:25.104 --> 08:26.338
How many days a week

08:26.338 --> 08:28.173
do you work at the temple?

08:28.173 --> 08:29.108
Three.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.210
You have a key?

08:31.210 --> 08:32.510
No need.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.413
The door is always open.

08:34.413 --> 08:36.782
I told the monks...

08:36.782 --> 08:38.116
too trusting.

08:38.116 --> 08:40.818
In this neighborhood, yeah.

08:40.818 --> 08:43.155
They ever have
any problems with gangs?

08:43.155 --> 08:43.989
Couple months ago,

08:43.989 --> 08:47.292
I saw spray paints
on the back wall.

08:47.292 --> 08:48.727
Gang signs.

08:48.727 --> 08:52.865
I wanted to file
a police report, but Ananda...

08:52.865 --> 08:55.234
told me not to.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.202
Why not?

08:58.470 --> 08:59.838
I told you.

08:59.838 --> 09:03.274
"Monks are too trusting."

10:48.113 --> 10:50.182
Interesting reading
for a man of the cloth.

10:50.182 --> 10:53.051
That monk had it in the
bottom of his desk drawer.

10:53.051 --> 10:55.087
And he was the guy
handling the money.

10:55.087 --> 10:57.289
You hide one thing
from your brothers,

10:57.289 --> 10:58.690
then maybe he
was hiding more.

10:58.690 --> 11:01.360
Yeah, but just 'cause
you're stashing trash

11:01.360 --> 11:02.461
doesn't make you a killer.

11:02.461 --> 11:05.063
Yeah, I'm just...
talking it out, Sara.

11:05.063 --> 11:05.764
What'd you find?

11:05.764 --> 11:07.966
I found some boot prints
on the prayer room rug.

11:07.966 --> 11:09.434
Monks don't wear boots.
Right, Nick?

11:09.434 --> 11:12.037
No. No. Or read porn
or commit murder.

11:12.037 --> 11:14.973
I also found a smudge
with some trace material

11:14.973 --> 11:15.841
on a small statue.

11:15.841 --> 11:18.644
It was a partial... some ridge
detail, but not makable...

11:18.644 --> 11:21.413
and a wad of gum that was stuck
to the big Buddha.

11:21.413 --> 11:24.983
All of which is definitely
pointing to an outside job.

11:24.983 --> 11:26.285
Hey, whatever.
Outside, inside.

11:26.285 --> 11:29.021
Why shoot four people, then
leave the murder weapon

11:29.021 --> 11:32.491
behind the temple where even
a blind man could find it?

11:32.491 --> 11:34.891
And I hate
taking off my shoes.

11:40.532 --> 11:43.902
All were shot
in the third eye...

11:43.902 --> 11:46.905
the sixth chakra...
vortex of consciousness.

11:46.905 --> 11:50.809
I was a
Gray's Anatomy
man
until I lost my legs.

11:50.809 --> 11:53.078
I started getting
phantom pains

11:53.078 --> 11:55.714
no drug or exercise
could control.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.616
I began studying
the chakras.

11:57.616 --> 12:00.218
Well, I do know that
the seven chakras

12:00.218 --> 12:03.822
correspond to the body's
seven energy centers.

12:03.822 --> 12:05.724
Each has a color
and a vibration.

12:05.724 --> 12:10.128
Muladhara, the root chakra,
keeps us in the physical world.

12:10.128 --> 12:14.099
Svadisthana, seat
of sexual energy.

12:14.099 --> 12:18.637
Manipura, melting pot of
spiritual and earthly desires.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.839
Anahata, the loving heart.

12:20.839 --> 12:24.376
Visuddha, where feelings
are given expression.

12:24.376 --> 12:26.178
Ajna, the third eye.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.347
Saharsrara, the
crown connecting

12:28.347 --> 12:32.517
the mortal human to
the timeless universe.

12:32.517 --> 12:34.853
Let's go back
to the third eye.

12:34.853 --> 12:35.787
Ajna, the hub

12:35.787 --> 12:36.955
of higher consciousness.

12:36.955 --> 12:40.359
If someone were
threatened by
that consciousness,

12:40.359 --> 12:42.127
that would be
a logical target, yeah?

12:42.127 --> 12:45.364
There's a very good chance
your killer's a Buddhist.

12:45.364 --> 12:47.232
This is where Ecklie swabbed

12:47.232 --> 12:51.169
the blood sample
from the blade 15 years ago.

12:51.169 --> 12:53.138
It's your friend's...

12:53.138 --> 12:54.373
Stephanie Watson.

12:54.373 --> 12:57.943
We got the second blood sample
from the handle end.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.245
Perfect match to Dwight Kelso,

13:00.245 --> 13:03.942
the guy convicted
for Stephanie's murder.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.519
Thank you, Greg.

13:07.519 --> 13:09.020
Thank you.

13:09.020 --> 13:10.922
Had to be hard on you.

13:10.922 --> 13:14.092
Losing a friend,
someone that you...

13:14.092 --> 13:16.754
I'm taking this to Trace.

13:21.233 --> 13:24.066
Did I miss something?

13:25.237 --> 13:27.205
You see that?

13:27.205 --> 13:29.908
Hmm. It's blood.
That's a weak sample.

13:29.908 --> 13:32.144
That's probably
why Ecklie took
the thicker one.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.813
15 years ago, we figured,
why light up something

13:34.813 --> 13:36.548
you can't analyze
in the first place?

13:36.548 --> 13:39.518
Yeah, except now,
we can replicate
DNA a million times,

13:39.518 --> 13:42.220
even from the most
minute sample of blood.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.922
Priority.

13:43.922 --> 13:46.324
Let me know
what you find out.

13:46.324 --> 13:48.258
Yes, ma'am.

13:51.596 --> 13:52.664
Bobby D shot
the test bullet

13:52.664 --> 13:55.434
through the rifle you
found behind the temple.

13:55.434 --> 13:56.735
It's on the right.

13:56.735 --> 13:59.738
Bullet from vic number
three on the left.

13:59.738 --> 14:01.673
Lands and grooves
align perfectly.

14:01.673 --> 14:05.444
Well, we got ourselves
a murder weapon.

14:05.444 --> 14:07.279
Well, we've got
more than that.

14:07.279 --> 14:09.781
Sara and I found prints
off the rifle.

14:09.781 --> 14:10.649
And?

14:10.649 --> 14:12.617
Well, I'll give
you a hint.

14:12.617 --> 14:14.119
He's bald, he wears a robe

14:14.119 --> 14:16.555
and he likes
his coeds bodacious.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.557
(sighs)

14:18.557 --> 14:21.760
One survivor,
one suspect.

14:21.760 --> 14:25.526
And a whole lot
of bad karma.

14:26.465 --> 14:28.767
I entered through the back.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.836
The rifle was on my desk.

14:30.836 --> 14:33.205
I walked into the prayer room

14:33.205 --> 14:35.640
to ask my brothers
about the gun.

14:35.640 --> 14:40.545
I returned to my office,
placed the weapon outside,

14:40.545 --> 14:42.581
and went for help.

14:42.581 --> 14:45.317
Tampering with evidence
is against the law.

14:45.317 --> 14:47.819
The temple is a holy place.

14:47.819 --> 14:50.722
Maybe, but a crime
had been committed there.

14:50.722 --> 14:53.792
Please understand...
I was obeying my teachings.

14:53.792 --> 14:57.229
Do your teachings allow
you to keep pornography?

14:57.229 --> 15:00.565
Someone left the magazine
at the temple.

15:00.565 --> 15:01.199
I kept it

15:01.199 --> 15:03.235
in case this
person came back.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.269
Yeah, right.

15:04.269 --> 15:05.570
If you are no longer

15:05.570 --> 15:07.739
attached
to seeking pleasure,

15:07.739 --> 15:09.074
pictures of naked women

15:09.074 --> 15:11.776
mean no more than
pictures of waterfalls.

15:11.776 --> 15:16.781
I abstain from
erotic behavior not
because we believe

15:16.781 --> 15:17.649
sex is sinful,

15:17.649 --> 15:22.020
but because preoccupation
with worldly pleasure

15:22.020 --> 15:24.022
diverts us from the path.

15:24.022 --> 15:26.458
Got to be a lot easier
to be a monk

15:26.458 --> 15:28.226
in a monastery on a mountaintop

15:28.226 --> 15:30.717
than one on Las Vegas Boulevard.

15:32.197 --> 15:35.655
I ran that faint blood
sample from the knife.

15:37.068 --> 15:38.603
Wow.

15:38.603 --> 15:39.905
Yeah, I know.

15:39.905 --> 15:41.072
Willows.

15:41.072 --> 15:43.700
Just the person
I wanted to see.

15:44.809 --> 15:45.544
I just signed off

15:45.544 --> 15:47.979
on the Authorization
to Destroy Evidence

15:47.979 --> 15:49.548
in the Stephanie Watson
homicides

15:49.548 --> 15:52.551
since I was the primary,
and then I learned tonight

15:52.551 --> 15:55.053
that the evidence
has been checked out

15:55.053 --> 15:56.421
by you and Warrick.

15:56.421 --> 15:57.689
You care to explain that?

15:57.689 --> 16:00.191
Found a third donor
on the knife.

16:00.191 --> 16:02.060
Blood's from a male.
Unknown.

16:02.060 --> 16:04.229
But Kelso didn't have
an accomplice.

16:04.229 --> 16:08.063
Then you know why
we're looking at the file.

16:09.100 --> 16:10.201
Hey.
Hey.

16:10.201 --> 16:12.571
Here's the good news.

16:12.571 --> 16:14.172
Look at his hands.

16:14.172 --> 16:16.575
The cut on his
left index finger...

16:16.575 --> 16:20.705
it's just like
the evidence log says.

16:22.314 --> 16:25.350
Kelso's glove
is not in any

16:25.350 --> 16:29.287
of the crime scene photos,
any of the sketches, anywhere.

16:29.287 --> 16:30.889
Pictures get lost, Warrick.

16:30.889 --> 16:33.158
I do remember that glove,
though.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.293
Kelso's blood was all over it.

16:35.293 --> 16:37.262
It is in the evidence log.

16:37.262 --> 16:39.431
You see
who logged it in?

16:39.431 --> 16:42.093
Jimmy Tadero.

16:43.268 --> 16:48.501
Booked two days
after the murder.

16:49.641 --> 16:51.242
So why no photos?

16:51.242 --> 16:53.478
Want me to tag along?

16:53.478 --> 16:54.746
He's my mentor.

16:54.746 --> 16:55.780
If he screwed up,

16:55.780 --> 16:59.307
I don't think he's going
to want an audience.

17:02.854 --> 17:04.788
(computer beeps)

17:07.626 --> 17:08.887
You know those prints

17:08.926 --> 17:10.394
that Nick and I
got off the rifle?

17:10.628 --> 17:12.597
D.A. Says it's enough
for a warrant.

17:12.597 --> 17:13.290
Ananda's already in custody.

17:13.598 --> 17:14.622
Well, I better
talk fast, then.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.001
The prints are
only telling half the story.

17:16.001 --> 17:19.630
Even when a shooter holds a gun,
he grips the barrel

17:20.571 --> 17:21.138
and he wraps his index finger
around the trigger.

17:21.138 --> 17:23.474
Ananda never fingered
the trigger.

17:23.474 --> 17:24.309
What about the prints?

17:24.309 --> 17:28.580
On the weapon, but definitely
not where they should be.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.343
(computer beeps)

17:40.959 --> 17:43.094
He held the rifle
by the stock

17:43.094 --> 17:44.596
barrel pointing down.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.264
He never fired it.

17:46.264 --> 17:48.299
No. Anticipating
your next question,

17:48.299 --> 17:49.367
the rifle's not registered.

17:49.367 --> 17:52.537
Well, Nevada
doesn't require
rifle registration.

17:52.537 --> 17:53.905
What's
my next question?

17:53.905 --> 17:56.169
That chewing gum
is with DNA.

18:24.703 --> 18:27.103
(whirring)

18:28.273 --> 18:30.475
"Placa"
was carved
into the panel

18:30.475 --> 18:32.077
with a straight-edged blade.

18:32.077 --> 18:34.112
Nondescript.
Not much to work with.

18:34.112 --> 18:36.381
What's unusual is
the
placa
itself.

18:36.381 --> 18:38.316
Bangers tag homicides
all the time.

18:38.316 --> 18:41.486
Yeah, but after those
German tourists were killed,

18:41.486 --> 18:44.089
the Snakebacks were
pretty much wiped out.

18:44.089 --> 18:46.524
The cops really came down hard
on those guys.

18:46.524 --> 18:48.860
27 members were put away
for... for murder

18:48.860 --> 18:51.629
and weapons possession,
drugs, you name it.

18:51.629 --> 18:52.897
According to the Gang Unit,

18:52.897 --> 18:55.500
they've been out
of business about a year.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.970
So we're looking
at a Warhol.

18:58.970 --> 18:59.804
Hmm?

18:59.804 --> 19:01.339
Well, it's not
a real soup can.

19:01.339 --> 19:02.741
It's a painting
of a soup can.

19:02.741 --> 19:05.510
Not a gang member.
A... wannabe?

19:05.510 --> 19:09.469
Except, if you want to be
in a gang, you can be.

19:11.249 --> 19:12.584
False clue.

19:12.584 --> 19:13.551
Excuse me, sir?

19:13.551 --> 19:14.786
I'm sorry to interrupt.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.287
David, stop
calling me "sir."

19:16.287 --> 19:17.956
What's up
with the Air Force?

19:17.956 --> 19:19.524
You're all clear
for tonight.

19:19.524 --> 19:20.191
Air Force?

19:20.191 --> 19:22.127
My dad's a colonel
out at Nellis.

19:22.127 --> 19:24.462
Grissom's requested
a meeting.

19:24.462 --> 19:24.929
Why?

19:24.929 --> 19:27.031
I'm enlisting.

19:27.031 --> 19:28.366
(chuckles)

19:28.366 --> 19:31.436
Since 9-11, geosynchronous
government satellites

19:31.436 --> 19:33.204
have maintained a constant watch

19:33.204 --> 19:34.939
over U.S. Military
installations.

19:34.939 --> 19:37.208
And the surrounding areas
as well, right?

19:37.208 --> 19:40.211
This temple is less
than two miles from your base.

19:40.211 --> 19:43.815
What's the chances your
satellite's picked something up?

19:43.815 --> 19:46.851
We can see a postage stamp
on the sidewalk

19:46.851 --> 19:48.785
outside Lenin's tomb.

19:49.854 --> 19:51.412
Cool.

20:05.003 --> 20:07.472
Hey. Glad to see
you're not in uniform.

20:07.472 --> 20:11.109
Only one vehicle passed
through the temple gates

20:11.109 --> 20:13.344
around the time
of the murders.

20:13.344 --> 20:15.914
Parked next
to the monk's car.

20:15.914 --> 20:18.950
"PROUD.U.S."

20:18.950 --> 20:21.686
Registered
to a Peter Hutchins.

20:21.686 --> 20:24.088
Did you get his picture
from outer space?

20:24.088 --> 20:25.857
All photographs
were intermittent.

20:25.857 --> 20:27.882
None included
the driver.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.195
The coffee shop?

20:30.195 --> 20:30.695
Yep.

20:30.695 --> 20:35.834
Would you like to,
uh... process the truck?

20:35.834 --> 20:36.501
Sure.

20:36.501 --> 20:38.025
Thank you.

20:46.978 --> 20:47.946
Hi, there.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.247
Can I help you guys?

20:49.247 --> 20:50.582
Yeah. I'm Nick Stokes.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.583
This is Gil Grissom.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.718
We're with
the Vegas Crime Lab.

20:53.718 --> 20:54.519
Pete Hutchins.

20:54.519 --> 20:56.554
Uh... cops are always welcome.

20:56.554 --> 20:59.490
Any sandwich,
on the house, guys.

20:59.490 --> 21:00.124
No, thanks.

21:00.124 --> 21:02.794
We're here about the murders
at the Buddhist temple

21:02.794 --> 21:04.128
off Crystal Peak Drive.

21:04.128 --> 21:05.029
Yeah, I heard about it.

21:05.029 --> 21:07.165
I heard that, uh... some
of the local business owners

21:07.165 --> 21:09.968
weren't very happy
with the members of the temple.

21:09.968 --> 21:11.035
The monks?

21:11.035 --> 21:13.071
Well, they don't speak English,

21:13.071 --> 21:15.506
and that bothered
the other customers.

21:15.506 --> 21:19.811
And it's kind of hard to sell
beer or sandwiches or videos

21:19.811 --> 21:22.146
when the monks don't partake
in any of those things.

21:22.146 --> 21:24.816
Those monks changed
the whole feel

21:24.816 --> 21:25.683
of this neighborhood.

21:25.683 --> 21:28.219
I'm not surprised
at any of these murders.

21:28.219 --> 21:29.320
Your name is?

21:29.320 --> 21:30.388
Peter Hutchins Sr.

21:30.388 --> 21:34.459
You know what?
I've owned this
shop for 20 years.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.394
Suddenly,
these holy robers move in here,

21:36.394 --> 21:37.762
and business takes
a nosedive.

21:37.762 --> 21:39.330
And I don't care
what they say,

21:39.330 --> 21:41.399
it doesn't have
a damn thing to do

21:41.399 --> 21:42.233
with the economy.

21:42.233 --> 21:44.793
Good night, Las Vegas;
good morning, Vietnam.

21:45.970 --> 21:48.006
Uh... Grissom, I found these

21:48.006 --> 21:50.338
on the front seat.

21:52.977 --> 21:54.913
Uh... which one
of you two guys

21:54.913 --> 21:56.781
drives the
truck outside?

21:56.781 --> 21:57.582
I do.

21:57.582 --> 21:58.983
Well, these wouldn't be

21:58.983 --> 22:00.418
your prayer beads, would they?

22:00.418 --> 22:02.453
No. Isn't there
a law against her

22:02.453 --> 22:04.422
sniffing around inside my truck?

22:04.422 --> 22:05.423
She has a warrant.

22:05.423 --> 22:09.160
Sir, your vehicle was seen
in the driveway of the temple

22:09.160 --> 22:10.929
around the time of the murders.

22:10.929 --> 22:13.164
Now, why would I go
to a Buddhist temple?

22:13.164 --> 22:16.099
Probably not looking
for salvation.

22:19.137 --> 22:21.172
(rock music playing)

22:21.172 --> 22:23.003
We want two.

22:28.613 --> 22:29.948
Jimmy's running late.

22:29.948 --> 22:31.783
Nothing changes, huh?

22:31.783 --> 22:32.750
Oh, uh...

22:32.750 --> 22:34.986
(laughing)
Some
things do.

22:34.986 --> 22:35.887
Are you kidding, Catherine?

22:35.887 --> 22:38.690
Any day of the week, honey,
you can still have them

22:38.690 --> 22:40.325
three deep,
lined up at the bar.

22:40.325 --> 22:41.993
You were always
nice to me, Ted.

22:41.993 --> 22:43.895
Nice has nothing
to do with it, kid.

22:43.895 --> 22:46.264
Let's face it,
you and this CSI stuff...

22:46.264 --> 22:49.534
that's where you light up...
you're a natural.

22:49.534 --> 22:50.969
Jimmy changed my life.

22:50.969 --> 22:54.472
And no funny stuff,
just mentor and pupil.

22:54.472 --> 22:58.109
Guy delivered me
into a whole new life.

22:58.109 --> 23:00.278
Hey! Jimmy!

23:00.278 --> 23:01.779
What's the case of the week?

23:01.779 --> 23:03.348
Guy's up a tree, dead.
Mm-hmm?

23:03.348 --> 23:05.183
Ex-wife in the bedroom,
with the pool man,

23:05.183 --> 23:07.485
both
very
alive, if
you know what I mean.

23:07.485 --> 23:08.720
Guy's spying on his ex.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.388
Has a heart attack
when he sees her

23:10.388 --> 23:11.889
doing the nasty
with the pool man.

23:11.889 --> 23:14.392
You must have read
the coroner's report.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.426
Just my woman's intuition.

23:15.426 --> 23:19.630
I wish he could have done
the same for Stephanie.

23:19.630 --> 23:21.299
Yeah.
Hey, Cath.

23:21.299 --> 23:22.767
What's the case of the week?

23:22.767 --> 23:24.102
(sighs)

23:24.102 --> 23:26.204
Wish I didn't know.

23:26.204 --> 23:27.438
You up for this?

23:27.438 --> 23:28.373
Ted.

23:28.373 --> 23:31.433
See you, kid.

23:34.712 --> 23:37.237
This is where Stephanie
was found.

23:40.151 --> 23:43.609
Worst day of my life.

23:46.791 --> 23:50.228
Over there is where the
beat cop grabbed Kelso

23:50.228 --> 23:51.991
as he was running out
into the alley.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.965
That's right.

23:53.965 --> 23:56.024
Now, do you remember
where you found
Kelso's bloody glove?

23:56.701 --> 23:59.003
Up there, around the corner
of that Dumpster.

23:59.003 --> 24:00.071
I figure he'd dropped it,
trying to get away.

24:00.071 --> 24:02.540
And then you logged
it into evidence?

24:02.540 --> 24:03.541
No sketches, no photos.

24:03.541 --> 24:06.978
Just brought it in two
days after the murder.

24:06.978 --> 24:08.536
Yeah.

24:09.447 --> 24:13.651
Arresting officer never saw
a glove, according to the file.

24:13.651 --> 24:17.088
He was busy trying
to corral Kelso. It was dark.

24:17.088 --> 24:19.056
I came back in the daylight.
What's going on?

24:19.757 --> 24:21.225
You always used to say,

24:21.225 --> 24:23.061
if something doesn't feel right,
it probably isn't.

24:23.061 --> 24:25.052
What do you want?
We got the guy.

24:26.064 --> 24:28.999
Jimmy, you're not hiding
anything, are you?

24:30.168 --> 24:32.937
You didn't try
to make things fit...?

24:32.937 --> 24:36.338
I'm going to forget
you ever asked that.

25:06.237 --> 25:09.434
I thought so.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.983
Lot of activity
in this neighborhood.

25:18.983 --> 25:21.185
Guy going the wrong way
on a one-way.

25:21.185 --> 25:22.186
Fender bender on the corner.

25:22.186 --> 25:24.689
Some guy running down
the middle of the street...

25:24.689 --> 25:26.190
Good. We should go
after him, then,

25:26.190 --> 25:28.826
'cause the sandwich dad's
going to walk.

25:28.826 --> 25:30.561
His alibi checks out...
he was in Laughlin

25:30.561 --> 25:32.063
with his wife
at a farmers market.

25:32.063 --> 25:34.132
What about the truck?
Took the van.

25:34.132 --> 25:36.067
Left the truck
in the driveway.

25:36.067 --> 25:36.901
Junior?

25:36.901 --> 25:37.668
Yeah.

25:37.668 --> 25:40.371
Teenage kid, no parents,
keys to a ride.

25:40.371 --> 25:41.472
I'm all over him.

25:41.472 --> 25:44.375
Results from
the colored material

25:44.375 --> 25:45.443
found at the crime scene.

25:45.443 --> 25:47.512
I'm trying to be humble
but, once again,

25:47.512 --> 25:49.104
I have the case breaker.

25:54.418 --> 25:56.187
You may be right.

25:56.187 --> 25:59.390
Paintball paint.

25:59.390 --> 26:01.881
(rapid gunfire)

26:07.765 --> 26:09.367
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

26:09.367 --> 26:11.062
Knock it off!

26:13.037 --> 26:15.005
Come on over here, Rambo.

26:16.908 --> 26:19.944
Wow! One pop
to the chest

26:19.944 --> 26:21.377
and you're out.

26:22.380 --> 26:23.915
You got off easy.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.316
What are you guys
doing here?

26:25.316 --> 26:27.385
Well, we know that
your father's truck

26:27.385 --> 26:29.053
was at the temple at
the time of the murders.

26:29.053 --> 26:30.588
And our lab identified
boot prints

26:30.588 --> 26:32.089
and paint residue
near the altar.

26:32.089 --> 26:33.591
What kind of paint?

26:33.591 --> 26:35.893
Water soluble, with
flecks of plastic coating...

26:35.893 --> 26:37.395
like the kind
on your clothes.

26:37.395 --> 26:39.230
Toss them in the
wash, paint's gone.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.199
(gunfire continuing)

26:41.199 --> 26:42.962
You were there, weren't you?

26:46.971 --> 26:49.064
(clears throat)

26:50.341 --> 26:54.145
I've never been
to the temple.

26:54.145 --> 26:56.613
Never.

26:58.716 --> 27:01.048
Well...

27:02.687 --> 27:04.355
See...

27:04.355 --> 27:07.858
this boot print
says you were.

27:07.858 --> 27:09.827
Tell him who you lent
your boots to.

27:09.827 --> 27:12.697
Tell him, or they'll accuse
you of something else.

27:12.697 --> 27:14.966
Nobody else
wears my boots.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.167
Son...

27:16.167 --> 27:17.368
(sighs)

27:17.368 --> 27:20.238
We heard that this
place was freaky...

27:20.238 --> 27:23.608
that there was a
money tree and drugs.

27:23.608 --> 27:26.444
We wanted to see
for ourselves.

27:26.444 --> 27:28.713
(laughing)

27:28.713 --> 27:30.014
That's got to be
solid gold, man.

27:30.014 --> 27:31.849
(door opening)
Come on, come on...

27:31.849 --> 27:33.884
We heard someone coming,
and we took off.

27:33.884 --> 27:36.454
That's why you found
my boot prints.

27:36.454 --> 27:37.614
No.

27:39.257 --> 27:40.391
You see, our dust lifter

27:40.391 --> 27:44.657
is only effective
on very recent prints.

27:45.263 --> 27:48.096
I think you were there
the day of the murders.

27:54.772 --> 27:56.040
It was a...

27:56.040 --> 27:56.974
(clears throat)

27:56.974 --> 28:00.740
It was a week ago when
I went there with my friends.

28:02.546 --> 28:04.548
But Tommy, he copped a statue.

28:04.548 --> 28:08.352
I went back to return it,
and I was removing my boots

28:08.352 --> 28:12.049
when I looked inside
and I saw them laying there.

28:17.762 --> 28:19.997
I wanted to call the police,
but I knew,

28:19.997 --> 28:23.524
if they found me there,
they'd think I did it.

28:26.003 --> 28:29.939
How'd you know
to remove your boots?

28:33.177 --> 28:36.010
You'd been there before?

28:37.014 --> 28:38.716
Maybe.

28:38.716 --> 28:42.413
What are you accusing
my son of now?

28:43.854 --> 28:46.290
They were my friends.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.125
Whoa.

28:48.125 --> 28:52.084
Those monks were your friends?

28:53.597 --> 28:57.363
I'm taking a walk.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.374
(door closes)

29:08.212 --> 29:10.348
Someone once asked the Buddha,

29:10.348 --> 29:14.785
"How do we escape the heat
of the summer's day?"

29:14.785 --> 29:16.721
And the Buddha said,

29:16.721 --> 29:21.715
"Why not leap into a blazing furnace?"

29:30.501 --> 29:32.803
I got your beep.
Did you run those tests?

29:32.803 --> 29:34.071
Kelso's glove...

29:34.071 --> 29:35.906
embedded in the
fabric... dog hair.

29:35.906 --> 29:37.742
I isolated motor oil
on the thumb,

29:37.742 --> 29:40.578
and the rest of the stains
were bloodstains...

29:40.578 --> 29:42.513
Kelso's... just like
in the report.

29:42.513 --> 29:44.615
From where he cut himself
stabbing her?

29:44.615 --> 29:49.153
You'd think, but you kind of
put me on a wild snipe hunt,

29:49.153 --> 29:52.957
so I tested for all biologicals,
and I ran amylase

29:52.957 --> 29:55.826
and I found saliva.

29:55.826 --> 29:58.195
Kelso's saliva?

29:58.195 --> 29:58.929
Yeah.

29:58.929 --> 30:00.297
Well, blood mixed with saliva

30:00.297 --> 30:02.162
sounds like a mouth injury.

30:03.401 --> 30:06.771
Did you check the blood
that Ecklie collected

30:06.771 --> 30:08.005
from the murder weapon?

30:08.005 --> 30:08.739
Also amylase.

30:08.739 --> 30:11.275
Well, how did blood
from Kelso's mouth

30:11.275 --> 30:15.006
end up on the glove
as well as the knife?

30:18.215 --> 30:21.878
Unless it was planted.

30:29.126 --> 30:30.753
Jimmy.

30:33.764 --> 30:35.666
You set him up.
He killed her.

30:35.666 --> 30:36.300
You don't know that.
Yes, I do.

30:36.300 --> 30:39.036
When I stuck her,
she called out your name.

30:39.036 --> 30:41.705
Where's a cop when you need one?

30:41.705 --> 30:42.873
(Kelso yells)

30:42.873 --> 30:44.708
Guys like Kelso brag
all the time

30:44.708 --> 30:47.578
about things they didn't do,
cat-and-mouse...

30:47.578 --> 30:50.414
He had a history
of roughing up girls.

30:50.414 --> 30:51.348
He had a knife
cut on his hand.

30:51.348 --> 30:52.883
But the D. A...

30:52.883 --> 30:55.586
got cold feet,
released him.

30:55.586 --> 30:57.488
You don't have jack on me.

30:57.488 --> 30:59.990
(Kelso grunting)

30:59.990 --> 31:03.153
(choking)

31:09.800 --> 31:12.369
I helped
the evidence along.

31:12.369 --> 31:14.605
Good evidence
doesn't need help.

31:14.605 --> 31:17.836
You
taught me that one.

31:19.310 --> 31:23.314
I'm going to have to ask you
for a sample of your blood.

31:23.314 --> 31:24.248
What?

31:24.248 --> 31:26.350
New technology.

31:26.350 --> 31:30.321
We isolated male blood
on the murder weapon.

31:30.321 --> 31:32.423
It doesn't belong to Kelso.

31:32.423 --> 31:35.025
You think
I killed Stephanie?

31:35.025 --> 31:37.962
You were in love
with her, Jimmy.

31:37.962 --> 31:40.831
That was no secret.

31:40.831 --> 31:43.265
But the ring was.

31:44.201 --> 31:45.703
Three karats,

31:45.703 --> 31:48.739
and she turned you down.

31:48.739 --> 31:49.874
Same week she died.

31:49.874 --> 31:53.105
I never thought
anything of it till now.

31:55.646 --> 31:57.915
You're good.

31:57.915 --> 31:59.550
You are.

31:59.550 --> 32:01.485
I'll get a warrant.

32:01.485 --> 32:02.952
Yeah, you do that.

32:03.921 --> 32:06.151
You go get a warrant.

32:11.228 --> 32:14.031
Well, I have to warn you.

32:14.031 --> 32:17.535
Any food I find in the gum
is not going to be unique.

32:17.535 --> 32:19.036
Why don't
you just give me

32:19.036 --> 32:20.070
a suspect
I can match to?

32:20.070 --> 32:21.906
I can't give you
what I don't have, Greg.

32:21.906 --> 32:25.109
All we're going to have is
what we get from this gum.

32:25.109 --> 32:29.346
All right, then I guess it's
slice and dice.

32:29.346 --> 32:31.644
Thank you.

32:41.659 --> 32:47.464
Results on
Jimmy Tadero's sample.

32:47.464 --> 32:50.661
I just got it back from DNA.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.772
(sighs)

32:56.640 --> 32:58.835
Not going to take a look at it?

33:00.477 --> 33:03.378
(laughs)

33:05.716 --> 33:09.853
There was a shooting one night
in the club,

33:09.853 --> 33:12.556
and Jimmy pulls out
his revolver

33:12.556 --> 33:14.992
and takes down the bad guy.

33:14.992 --> 33:16.927
The guy's on the floor, dying.

33:16.927 --> 33:22.422
Even though this was 15 years
ago, we still knew about AIDS.

33:23.901 --> 33:25.970
Jimmy then puts his gun away,
he leans down...

33:25.970 --> 33:28.072
he starts giving this guy
mouth-to-mouth

33:28.072 --> 33:31.838
after having just shot him.

33:32.910 --> 33:37.247
Forget his own life, he's going
to bring this guy back.

33:37.247 --> 33:41.115
And he did.

33:47.758 --> 33:49.827
You want me to open it?

33:49.827 --> 33:53.763
(sighs heavily)

34:07.544 --> 34:09.774
(laughter)

34:29.466 --> 34:32.302
You've been excluded
on the murder weapon.

34:32.302 --> 34:33.370
I could have
told you that.

34:33.370 --> 34:36.373
Did you compare the unknown
against the club owner, Ted?

34:36.373 --> 34:37.608
Yeah, I compared it to Ted.

34:37.608 --> 34:39.777
I compared it
to every male in CODIS.

34:39.777 --> 34:42.268
There were no hits, nowhere.

34:44.214 --> 34:46.648
Have a seat, Jimmy.

34:53.924 --> 34:55.726
I screwed up...
you want to hear me say it?

34:55.726 --> 34:56.994
I liked Kelso.

34:56.994 --> 34:58.228
Maybe I was wrong.

34:58.228 --> 35:00.662
Yeah, you were.

35:01.699 --> 35:03.997
So now what?

35:05.703 --> 35:07.295
You know now what.

35:07.705 --> 35:09.473
You're not serious.

35:09.473 --> 35:12.042
You put a man away for life
on planted evidence, Jimmy.

35:12.042 --> 35:14.211
He was a scumbag.
He copped to another murder.

35:14.211 --> 35:16.413
Scumbag or saint,
what you did is a capital crime.

35:16.413 --> 35:18.716
You can't play with evidence,
especially in a murder.

35:18.716 --> 35:21.719
I can get life in prison if you
turn me in. Do you know that?

35:21.719 --> 35:23.153
Maybe even the death penalty.

35:23.153 --> 35:24.221
Do you know that?!

35:24.221 --> 35:25.313
What do you want me to do?

35:26.724 --> 35:28.158
What do you
want me to do?

35:28.158 --> 35:29.226
Do you want me
to look the other way?

35:29.226 --> 35:30.294
Do you want me
to dummy my report?

35:30.294 --> 35:32.196
I can't believe
you're doing this to me.

35:32.196 --> 35:33.230
I gave you your career.

35:33.230 --> 35:34.198
I earned my career.

35:34.198 --> 35:35.599
And you did this to yourself.

35:35.599 --> 35:36.834
You fabricated evidence, Jimmy.

35:36.834 --> 35:38.969
You were two steps away
from turning tricks.

35:38.969 --> 35:40.027
This is the thanks I get?

35:45.743 --> 35:47.734
I danced, period.

35:50.748 --> 35:52.316
And, instead of feeling
sorry for yourself,

35:52.316 --> 35:53.117
think about this:

35:53.117 --> 35:55.352
When you were out there
planting evidence

35:55.352 --> 35:57.020
on a case that
you couldn't break,

35:57.020 --> 35:58.989
Stephanie's real killer
got away.

35:58.989 --> 36:02.059
And he's still out there

36:02.059 --> 36:05.195
because you sold
the one thing a cop

36:05.195 --> 36:07.131
can't afford to sell:
Your integrity.

36:07.131 --> 36:09.566
So you tell me,
between the two of us,

36:09.566 --> 36:11.534
who's the whore?

36:15.472 --> 36:18.270
Arrest him.

36:30.988 --> 36:32.222
You can hate me
all you want.

36:32.222 --> 36:34.486
I'm going to see you
through this.

36:57.147 --> 36:58.348
If you see the Buddha

36:58.348 --> 37:00.017
on the side of the road,
kill him.

37:00.017 --> 37:02.586
Because the true Buddha
is inside of us,

37:02.586 --> 37:04.188
so that is the false Buddha

37:04.188 --> 37:06.323
or a tired monk
who doesn't drive

37:06.323 --> 37:07.915
because he can't control
his anger.

37:09.927 --> 37:11.588
Climb in. I'll
give you a lift.

37:19.970 --> 37:21.403
We've cleared the father.

37:23.407 --> 37:24.975
The son has
also been cleared.

37:24.975 --> 37:26.943
And you're looking
for my help.

37:27.311 --> 37:30.872
You know my religion better
than I know your science.

37:32.883 --> 37:34.818
There was a gang
placa

37:34.818 --> 37:36.253
that was scrawled into
the walls of your temple.

37:36.253 --> 37:37.379
It was put there
to mislead us.

37:38.856 --> 37:40.157
The weapon you found
on your desk

37:40.157 --> 37:42.326
was also put there
to mislead us.

37:42.326 --> 37:45.362
The only other unexplained
evidence we have

37:45.362 --> 37:46.163
is the chewing gum.

37:46.163 --> 37:50.361
We found traces of
curry and saffron.

37:50.868 --> 37:54.605
Somebody ate a meal,
then chewed gum.

37:54.605 --> 37:56.807
Sometimes the best
evidence we get

37:56.807 --> 37:58.707
comes from what people do
when they're not thinking.

37:58.876 --> 38:00.867
Old habits, routines.

38:02.746 --> 38:04.414
I don't think the gum was
put there to mislead us.

38:04.414 --> 38:05.881
I think it was
just a mistake.

38:06.750 --> 38:08.877
And you want to know
what I eat for dinner.

38:11.889 --> 38:13.754
Curry and saffron.

38:16.126 --> 38:17.320
It's the real stuff.

38:17.895 --> 38:20.797
The neighborhood kids
thought we imported drugs.

38:20.797 --> 38:22.389
We just imported spices.

38:25.402 --> 38:27.165
And the five of you
ate together that night?

38:28.171 --> 38:29.106
Any guests?

38:29.106 --> 38:30.368
No.

38:30.908 --> 38:32.843
How come you don't leave
your cell phone on?

38:32.843 --> 38:33.901
We're in a temple, O'Riley.

38:34.912 --> 38:36.402
Oh, sorry.

38:36.914 --> 38:38.448
I just left the bank.

38:38.448 --> 38:40.984
Mr. Ananda here,
you're playing fast and loose

38:40.984 --> 38:42.352
with the school
fund money.

38:42.352 --> 38:44.187
You raised
just over $13,000

38:44.187 --> 38:45.984
for the school fund,

38:47.991 --> 38:50.527
but you only deposited $12,000.

38:50.527 --> 38:51.261
You planning any more

38:51.261 --> 38:52.863
trips to Disneyland?

38:52.863 --> 38:53.797
According to the bank,

38:53.797 --> 38:55.866
you opened the school
fund account

38:55.866 --> 38:56.900
on the same day

38:56.900 --> 38:57.889
as the murders.

38:57.935 --> 39:00.504
Where did you have
the money before that?

39:00.504 --> 39:01.937
In a box in my office.

39:13.951 --> 39:15.782
Curry powder.

39:19.089 --> 39:20.324
Your temple employs
a part-time cook.

39:20.324 --> 39:21.658
Mr. Suddahara moved on.

39:21.658 --> 39:25.059
After you caught him
with his hand in the till?

39:34.571 --> 39:37.274
Why didn't you tell us
about Mr. Suddahara before?

39:37.274 --> 39:41.938
Because a man steals
doesn't mean he also kills.

39:47.250 --> 39:51.521
Got any more of that
gum, Mr. Suddahara?

39:51.521 --> 39:54.285
Fresh out.

39:55.892 --> 39:57.757
(door opens)

39:59.763 --> 40:02.596
Yep. His DNA matches
the gum sample.

40:04.735 --> 40:08.205
You thought Ananda was going
to report you to the police

40:08.205 --> 40:09.740
for stealing
the money.

40:09.740 --> 40:10.707
Went home, got his rifle,

40:10.707 --> 40:12.509
came back to make sure
he didn't talk.

40:12.509 --> 40:13.510
And he'd gone
to the bank

40:13.510 --> 40:14.978
to protect the rest
of the money,

40:14.978 --> 40:16.546
but you didn't
know that.

40:16.546 --> 40:17.948
Where is he?
(chanting)

40:17.948 --> 40:19.783
Did he go to the copsalready?

40:19.783 --> 40:22.519
If they ask what I look like

40:22.519 --> 40:23.787
here's your answer.

40:23.787 --> 40:24.788
(gunshot)

40:24.788 --> 40:27.524
I'm curios about
one thing, though.

40:27.524 --> 40:32.863
Why did you shoot them all
in their sixth chakra?

40:32.863 --> 40:36.993
I shot them
between the eyes.

40:40.237 --> 40:44.867
(chanting)

40:45.305 --> 40:51.290
