00:00.420 --> 00:02.140
Previously on "Shades of Blue"...

00:02.440 --> 00:03.730
I heard shots. They sounded real.

00:03.730 --> 00:05.540
- You heard them too, right? - I'll protect you.

00:05.540 --> 00:06.790
I don't want to be this kind of cop.

00:06.790 --> 00:07.780
I got to make this right.

00:07.780 --> 00:09.920
Neighborhood's raising money to bury the man I killed.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.450
Funeral's tomorrow. You can come.

00:11.450 --> 00:13.690
Son of a bitch is folded up at 2:00 am

00:13.690 --> 00:15.750
Amber wanted to know if my husband wanted to have

00:15.760 --> 00:17.100
some late-night fun.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.700
You're about to move a lot of illegal cash.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.750
Meet me at the marina in two hours.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.230
I'm wiring you for the meet.

00:24.230 --> 00:25.380
Are you crazy?

00:25.390 --> 00:27.840
If I'm the mole, I must have a wire.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.220
Harlee, stop.

00:30.230 --> 00:31.510
I'm a little worried to let you in.

00:31.510 --> 00:32.720
Might cross that line.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.120
You could kiss me.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

00:44.230 --> 00:45.910
Where are the rest of my clothes?

00:45.920 --> 00:48.630
I'm lacking any incentive to answer that question.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.410
Okay, uh, what time is it?

00:52.650 --> 00:55.010
I'll have to write an apology note to the neighbors.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.620
I once arrested a blonde Caroline from an Occupy rally.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.070
She was from Greenwich.

01:06.110 --> 01:08.670
It's my ex-fiancee, from New Canaan.

01:08.790 --> 01:11.320
I never saw so many white college graduates in one place.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.560
I can't say she didn't go.

01:13.460 --> 01:15.790
She's building up her First Amendment practice.

01:16.170 --> 01:17.250
She's a lawyer?

01:20.960 --> 01:21.800
Sorry.

01:21.990 --> 01:22.920
Why don't you answer it?

01:23.750 --> 01:24.580
Don't go.

01:26.090 --> 01:27.500
Take care of New Canaan.

02:17.330 --> 02:19.840
Sir, please step down from the railing.

02:29.430 --> 02:30.650
Don't you ever sleep?

02:30.840 --> 02:32.940
I couldn't pick up your Wozniak meeting live,

02:32.940 --> 02:34.650
so I need to download the recording.

02:35.430 --> 02:37.080
And that couldn't wait till the morning?

02:37.080 --> 02:38.430
Things can go bump in the night.

02:38.510 --> 02:39.780
Oh, so now you're protecting me?

02:39.780 --> 02:41.350
Your own personal guardian angel.

02:41.430 --> 02:43.550
Is that what stalkers are calling themselves these days?

02:44.740 --> 02:46.730
Speaking of which, does that D.A. Of yours--

02:46.730 --> 02:47.730
he charge by the hour?

02:47.920 --> 02:49.250
I got my money's worth,

02:50.300 --> 02:51.800
but I'm guessing you know that already.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.550
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but rules state

02:53.550 --> 02:55.300
we're not allowed to listen to anything not having

02:55.300 --> 02:56.250
to do with the case.

02:56.690 --> 02:58.420
It's good to know you're all about the rules.

02:58.930 --> 03:00.290
Because I did some research,

03:00.290 --> 03:02.650
and FBI regs say that I don't have to wear a wire

03:02.650 --> 03:03.760
if I don't want to,

03:03.760 --> 03:05.900
especially if it puts my life in danger.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.420
- I would think staying out of prison

03:07.420 --> 03:08.900
would be sufficient motivation.

03:08.900 --> 03:12.050
It was a trap at the marina.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.340
Wozniak's hunch was me.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.880
I was lucky to walk out of there.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.180
That doesn't even make sense.

03:17.180 --> 03:18.320
You passed his polygraph.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.310
Listen for yourself.

03:19.390 --> 03:21.860
He's paranoid now, and with good reason.

03:21.870 --> 03:23.480
- What did you do? - I danced.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.490
I backed him off.

03:24.890 --> 03:26.270
But I'm not wearing that thing.

03:26.910 --> 03:29.550
That wouldn't be a problem, Harlee, if I could trust you.

03:29.650 --> 03:33.240
But for that to happen, I need something specific on Wozniak,

03:33.240 --> 03:35.090
something that advances this investigation.

03:35.210 --> 03:37.320
Keep the wire off me and I might have a chance.

03:38.140 --> 03:39.740
I can give you a ride home.

03:39.750 --> 03:42.220
Yeah, because you're all about my safety.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.320
You mind if I share a little?

04:06.120 --> 04:07.290
Knock yourself out.

04:10.940 --> 04:11.920
"Always faithful."

04:13.950 --> 04:14.880
Did you serve?

04:15.560 --> 04:16.350
Nah.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.790
I just like military stuff.

04:22.060 --> 04:22.920
You want to play?

05:04.470 --> 05:05.690
What the hell do you want?

05:44.470 --> 05:45.690
Damn it, not tonight.

05:48.840 --> 05:49.630
Stop!

05:49.640 --> 05:51.350
You getting out? Lady, what are we doing?

05:51.350 --> 05:52.740
Are we going, or are we staying?

05:54.410 --> 05:55.480
This is Detective Santos,

05:55.480 --> 05:58.090
requesting immediate backup on 4th and Grant

05:58.150 --> 06:00.500
for a possible armed robbery in progress.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.110
Police! Hands in the air.

06:15.420 --> 06:17.290
On the ground. On the ground!

06:18.520 --> 06:19.450
Drop the bag.

06:20.850 --> 06:21.930
Bitch pulled the panic alarm.

06:21.930 --> 06:23.430
5-0, man.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.420
- Drop the knife. - No, we're leaving.

06:26.510 --> 06:27.930
I'll do this fool right now.

06:27.980 --> 06:29.910
Look, just be cool. Be cool, all right?

06:29.910 --> 06:31.710
Right now, you're only looking at armed robbery.

06:32.390 --> 06:33.870
Hey, get the money. Get the money.

06:35.130 --> 06:37.080
Look, how bad do you want to make this on yourself?

06:37.450 --> 06:39.590
All right, you got paid, let him go.

06:39.770 --> 06:41.620
Blue lights coming, man. We got to bounce.

06:42.380 --> 06:44.030
No! No!

06:48.270 --> 06:49.920
Don't! Don't, don't.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.530
You're gonna be all right, but you can't take it out, okay?

06:53.530 --> 06:54.460
I need an ambulance!

06:54.460 --> 06:58.650
Two male suspects, armed, fled eastbound on 4th!

07:01.240 --> 07:03.040
It's okay. It's okay.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.070
It's not what it looks like.

07:07.070 --> 07:08.350
I'm not an overly intelligent man,

07:08.350 --> 07:09.540
but if it walks like a duck,

07:09.540 --> 07:11.870
and it talks like a duck, usually it's a fricking duck.

07:11.870 --> 07:13.920
Sap, tell your buddy down at the lab

07:13.920 --> 07:15.780
to rush my prints from my bodega robbery.

07:15.780 --> 07:17.490
The lab prioritizes homicides.

07:17.490 --> 07:18.730
If you hadn't saved your victim's life,

07:18.730 --> 07:19.890
you'd have your prints by now.

07:20.390 --> 07:21.780
What were you doing in that neighborhood

07:21.780 --> 07:23.080
at three in the morning anyway?

07:23.770 --> 07:25.180
First in line for bagels.

07:25.180 --> 07:26.860
Hamlet here can go on a bagel run.

07:26.860 --> 07:28.920
According to our friends at the 5-7,

07:28.980 --> 07:30.770
he claims he dropped his phone taking a picture

07:30.770 --> 07:32.410
of the Roosevelt Island Bridge.

07:32.550 --> 07:33.970
No, I'm good to work.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.230
I wasn't trying to jump.

07:36.070 --> 07:37.600
I'm gonna choose to believe you,

07:38.480 --> 07:39.860
because we're all hands on deck today.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.570
Woz got in a car accident.

07:41.730 --> 07:43.600
- When? Is he okay? - Got a skull like a rhinoceros.

07:43.610 --> 07:45.870
He's fine, but I need you guys to work my robbery

07:45.870 --> 07:46.780
till I get back.

07:47.380 --> 07:49.410
Forget the skull, how's the Cadillac?

07:49.410 --> 07:50.200
Loman.

07:52.810 --> 07:54.040
Keep your feet on the ground.

07:57.930 --> 07:59.190
Amber, right?

07:59.560 --> 08:00.580
Hey, how's it going?

08:00.850 --> 08:02.210
You lose a puppy or something?

08:02.360 --> 08:03.860
I'm filing a complaint.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.260
Oh, a pot hole in front of the bar?

08:05.260 --> 08:06.600
Police brutality.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.210
That's my specialty.

08:08.210 --> 08:09.240
You have every reason to be upset.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.080
I think I can help.

08:11.180 --> 08:13.610
Yo, where you going, shutter-bug?

08:13.610 --> 08:14.480
Can we just drop this?

08:14.480 --> 08:17.190
Oh, the bogus photo-op story? Yeah, good idea.

08:17.190 --> 08:18.180
I don't think the man realizes

08:18.190 --> 08:20.090
what exceptional detectives we are.

08:20.090 --> 08:21.540
I was trying to ditch my gun, all right?

08:21.540 --> 08:22.900
And what is wrong with your gun?

08:26.510 --> 08:28.050
Is this the drug dealer you shot?

08:29.290 --> 08:32.419
- They're burying him today. - A funeral card?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.600
What you gonna do? Send him flowers?

08:34.960 --> 08:37.159
Hmm? You need to see somebody, man--

08:37.750 --> 08:38.990
a rabbi, priest,

08:38.990 --> 08:40.870
department shrink, hooker.

08:43.169 --> 08:44.940
That's the luckiest gun in the precinct--

08:45.220 --> 08:46.370
never been fired.

08:47.380 --> 08:48.950
What, you want to trade me or something?

08:48.950 --> 08:50.570
You've proven yours is accurate.

08:50.690 --> 08:52.010
Yeah, what do you say, Loman?

08:52.570 --> 08:53.810
Lay this to rest with him.

08:57.950 --> 08:58.730
All right.

09:01.910 --> 09:03.020
My work here is done.

09:03.020 --> 09:03.780
Yeah.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.720
Do what you got to do to get your head straight.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.690
Don't embarrass us again.

09:17.740 --> 09:18.830
You gonna die on me?

09:20.710 --> 09:22.200
Is that what you're hoping for?

09:22.500 --> 09:23.710
I haven't decided yet.

09:27.110 --> 09:28.970
This betrayal, Harlee,

09:30.590 --> 09:32.610
it's really messing with my head.

09:33.650 --> 09:36.510
Last night, me pulling a gun on you

09:37.920 --> 09:39.750
is like you being the rat.

09:40.390 --> 09:43.540
It's just--I'm sorry.

09:44.070 --> 09:45.610
I'm really, really sorry.

09:45.610 --> 09:46.520
I love you.

09:49.540 --> 09:51.400
I decided I might want you to live.

09:52.830 --> 09:54.740
That's good, because the doctor said

09:54.740 --> 09:56.160
a knock on the head isn't fatal.

09:58.850 --> 10:00.710
Plus I got a favor to ask.

10:00.710 --> 10:02.110
Oh, now you're pushing it.

10:05.380 --> 10:07.750
I need you to pick up an empty van,

10:07.800 --> 10:09.320
move it to the parking spot

10:09.320 --> 10:11.470
that's aside my storage unit.

10:12.630 --> 10:17.030
You'll get a text with the location.

10:18.920 --> 10:19.950
What's this about?

10:20.700 --> 10:22.260
Cristina's future.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.590
It's just an empty van, nothing else?

10:26.650 --> 10:27.570
It's clean.

10:28.510 --> 10:32.840
Nothing that can come back to us, okay?

10:34.280 --> 10:35.060
We good?

10:38.770 --> 10:40.340
Surveillance footage from Harlee's bodega

10:40.340 --> 10:42.260
shows one suspect wearing a red hat.

10:42.260 --> 10:45.270
And a patrolman recovered this two blocks from the scene.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.690
Is it just me, or do criminals get stupider every year?

10:47.690 --> 10:48.800
Got his phone number in there?

10:49.270 --> 10:50.100
Where's Loman?

10:50.350 --> 10:51.210
He was just here.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.500
Maybe he went to get his head straight.

10:55.060 --> 10:56.700
Or to pay his respects.

10:59.530 --> 11:01.910
We all know my cousin was no angel.

11:03.180 --> 11:06.510
He had what he called his "Tendencies."

11:06.510 --> 11:08.350
And he tended to them regularly.

11:08.940 --> 11:10.940
But when the kids needed a coach...

11:12.730 --> 11:13.840
He stepped up.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.010
Now I'm not trying to make him out to be some kind of a saint,

11:19.700 --> 11:22.190
but he didn't deserve to get shot down like that.

11:28.670 --> 11:31.320
Is there anyone else who would like to speak?

11:32.240 --> 11:33.030
Anyone?

11:37.830 --> 11:40.490
- I got something to say. - Go ahead, brother.

11:40.520 --> 11:41.900
If we don't pull him out, he's dead.

11:41.900 --> 11:44.610
- Go get the car. - I'll be out front.

11:48.310 --> 11:49.140
I, uh...

11:52.100 --> 11:54.650
didn't know Jamarr that well.

11:54.650 --> 11:55.760
Our, uh...

11:56.280 --> 11:58.210
our paths only crossed once.

12:01.420 --> 12:02.540
It's the police!

12:02.540 --> 12:04.190
- What the hell they doing? - Oh, my God.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.700
This wasn't supposed to happen, all right?

12:05.700 --> 12:07.290
This wasn't right, and I just want you all to know

12:07.290 --> 12:08.390
that I'm sorry, all right?

12:08.390 --> 12:09.830
I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.080
- Let's go. - What are you doing?

12:12.400 --> 12:14.640
- Are you seriously doing this? - Sorry for the interruption.

12:14.640 --> 12:15.680
Official police business, sorry.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.660
You couldn't wait till you got outside?

12:17.750 --> 12:18.660
I need you to back up!

12:18.790 --> 12:20.070
Sir, I need you to back up.

12:20.830 --> 12:21.900
You can get your hands off me, man,

12:21.900 --> 12:23.500
like, it's not even that serious.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.950
Come on, come on. Yo, we don't have to be like--

12:26.110 --> 12:27.940
you know, we can just--yo, calm down, man.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.680
- It didn't have to be like that. - Stop resisting!

12:31.480 --> 12:33.650
Hey, hey, back up! Back up!

12:35.030 --> 12:38.160
Yo, it's all right. It's all right, just calm down.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.050
Come on, man, let's move.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.420
- Carlos, watch your back! - Let's go.

12:51.310 --> 12:52.930
You see that? Let's go! Go.

12:59.950 --> 13:01.980
Shut up. How's your rash?

13:03.520 --> 13:04.830
You left Loman in the car?

13:04.900 --> 13:07.050
Yeah. Wozniak got this one wrong.

13:07.050 --> 13:09.190
There's no way in hell this kid should be in our unit.

13:09.860 --> 13:10.920
It's complicated.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.000
Then you explain that crazy-ass move.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.910
Suicide by angry black mourners?

13:14.910 --> 13:16.270
Look, he's not crazy.

13:16.270 --> 13:19.770
- He's--he feels guilty. - Hell, everybody's guilty.

13:19.770 --> 13:21.580
He put down an armed drug dealer.

13:21.580 --> 13:22.670
Get over it.

13:26.470 --> 13:27.930
It wasn't a clean shoot.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.670
Hold up, the dealer shot at you.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.610
No, he wasn't armed.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.530
He was playing a video game.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.370
And Loman covered it up?

13:38.090 --> 13:40.700
No, I covered it up for him.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.080
Well, damn, Harlee.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.760
I would've done it for any of you.

13:43.830 --> 13:45.270
Well, he's not one of us.

13:45.270 --> 13:46.290
Well, he is now.

13:48.830 --> 13:50.480
Look, I gotta make a run for Woz.

13:51.760 --> 13:52.930
Can you keep him on ice?

13:52.930 --> 13:54.110
Yeah, we'll do more than that.

13:54.620 --> 13:55.730
Play nice, all right?

13:55.730 --> 13:57.250
- Use your words. - Yeah.

14:02.490 --> 14:04.730
Got a DNA match from a hair follicle in the red hat

14:04.730 --> 14:05.870
at Harlee's bodega,

14:05.880 --> 14:07.240
and an address on our suspect.

14:07.240 --> 14:07.840
Let's roll.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.950
Nah, we need to settle this Loman thing first.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.270
I say we just cut him loose.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.190
If Loman opens his mouth to Internal Affairs,

14:13.190 --> 14:14.840
he's gonna bring Harlee down with him.

14:14.850 --> 14:16.480
If he's suicidal, we need to know.

14:16.490 --> 14:18.450
Can't be riding around with a time bomb.

14:18.730 --> 14:19.890
What do you got in mind?

14:23.440 --> 14:24.620
A little detour.

14:41.330 --> 14:43.360
Incoming phone call, that's a milestone.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.090
I told you I'd get you something.

14:45.910 --> 14:47.650
Wozniak sent me to pick up a van.

14:47.660 --> 14:49.440
Oh, yeah? What's it for?

14:49.440 --> 14:50.420
I don't know.

14:50.630 --> 14:52.560
He wasn't in a place where he could get into it.

14:52.910 --> 14:54.180
Industry terminal parking lot.

14:54.180 --> 14:55.320
We'll meet you there.

14:55.740 --> 14:58.140
And Harlee, good work.

15:42.860 --> 15:44.580
Any altered or diminished sensations?

15:44.580 --> 15:45.960
You don't get your fingers out of my face,

15:45.960 --> 15:47.850
I'll give you an altered sensation.

15:47.850 --> 15:49.080
What about this? Does this hurt?

15:49.080 --> 15:50.220
No, it's fine.

15:51.830 --> 15:54.490
It's Linda. Uh, no, he can't.

15:54.490 --> 15:55.900
He's in the middle of an exam.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.610
Here, let me get--here.

15:58.220 --> 15:59.300
It's Harlee.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.090
Hey, what's up?

16:00.090 --> 16:01.680
What have you gotten us into?

16:02.080 --> 16:03.970
I'm looking at counting machines and explosives.

16:03.970 --> 16:05.080
You said the van was empty.

16:05.090 --> 16:06.330
Yeah, it's supposed to be empty.

16:06.330 --> 16:07.700
I'll be back on my next rotation.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.800
No, no, you're not going anywhere--hold on.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.790
- He was just trying to help. - Yeah, on his schedule.

16:11.790 --> 16:13.810
Please just get him back here.

16:15.060 --> 16:16.020
What now?

16:16.330 --> 16:17.290
You lied to me.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.390
I didn't lie to you. I wouldn't do that.

16:19.390 --> 16:21.500
Either you lied or you don't know what's going on.

16:21.550 --> 16:22.440
Which is it?

16:22.440 --> 16:24.800
I didn't know anything was gonna be in the van, Harlee.

16:24.800 --> 16:25.470
That's the truth.

16:25.470 --> 16:27.230
Well, then, you're in way over your head.

16:28.770 --> 16:29.890
Look, if you want to leave,

16:29.890 --> 16:32.360
I can't stop you, and I don't blame you.

16:32.570 --> 16:34.500
You know what? Just stay there.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.720
I'm coming over there now.

16:35.720 --> 16:36.700
No.

16:38.780 --> 16:41.500
Look, stay, all right? I'll take care it.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.510
Are you sure?

16:43.340 --> 16:44.230
Yeah.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.030
Okay, okay, okay, I get you.

17:02.030 --> 17:03.280
All right, I hear your point.

17:03.330 --> 17:05.270
You know, guilt's screwing with your head, Loman.

17:05.270 --> 17:06.359
We got to silence it.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.490
I'm not playing this game.

17:09.490 --> 17:11.640
The voices in your head don't go away on their own.

17:11.810 --> 17:13.020
Look, you guys got this all wrong.

17:13.020 --> 17:13.960
I wasn't trying to kill myself.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.589
No, now you want to repent?

17:15.910 --> 17:16.869
So here's your chance.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.490
And this is your priest.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.550
Take the gun, Loman.

17:20.720 --> 17:21.240
No!

17:21.240 --> 17:22.720
- Take it! - No, no, no--hey.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.410
Man, you almost got us killed in that church back there.

17:24.410 --> 17:25.630
You understand me?

17:26.319 --> 17:27.210
I didn't ask you to come!

17:27.210 --> 17:28.290
No, you didn't ask for our help,

17:28.290 --> 17:30.100
but we gave it 'cause we're family.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.680
Now, you want to off yourself, do it.

17:31.680 --> 17:32.750
But your lame-ass cries

17:32.750 --> 17:34.420
aren't only going to end your career.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.050
You're pissing away Harlee's too.

17:36.060 --> 17:37.150
And that ain't happening.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.430
You know what they say, right? A bullet never lies.

17:39.430 --> 17:41.400
So you take the gun, and you let fate decide.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.170
No.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.540
I were you, I'd take my chances with fate, Loman.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.620
No. No, I won't do it.

17:46.620 --> 17:49.020
Pull the trigger and get this over with!

17:49.990 --> 17:51.550
No! No! No!

17:54.420 --> 17:56.120
Guess he's not suicidal.

17:56.140 --> 17:57.850
Turns out you want to live, huh?

17:58.480 --> 17:59.940
Come on, get up, man.

17:59.990 --> 18:01.020
Get up!

18:02.860 --> 18:04.350
Put your hands behind your back.

18:12.770 --> 18:14.190
You already take a look inside?

18:14.320 --> 18:15.410
It's empty.

18:18.050 --> 18:19.170
What'd Wozniak say?

18:19.170 --> 18:19.940
He said there'd be a van.

18:19.940 --> 18:21.480
He didn't say there'd be anything in it.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.560
Something off with this floor.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.340
Anything under here?

18:30.850 --> 18:31.870
I don't know.

18:33.110 --> 18:34.320
False bottom.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.740
Wozniak say anything about this compartment?

18:39.830 --> 18:40.700
No.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.190
He just sent you out to pick up an empty van?

18:44.680 --> 18:46.160
Maybe they're planning to fill it.

18:46.160 --> 18:47.990
Yeah, and maybe you emptied it before we got here.

18:47.990 --> 18:49.440
I got here a minute before you.

18:49.440 --> 18:50.560
Found something.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.370
Hey, what's this plug into?

18:54.370 --> 18:55.820
What am I, Radio Shack?

19:01.240 --> 19:02.910
You're like a battered woman.

19:05.090 --> 19:06.770
I listened to that recording last night,

19:06.770 --> 19:10.320
and Wozniak was ready to put a bullet in your head,

19:11.700 --> 19:13.100
until you talked him out of it.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.900
Look at you. You're still trying to protect him.

19:26.390 --> 19:27.630
Open the trunk.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.490
Seriously?

19:29.590 --> 19:31.100
Yeah. Keys.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.980
You know, if Wozniak wasn't reaching beyond simple graft,

19:54.980 --> 19:56.860
neither of us would be in this position.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.400
Where did he tell you to take the van?

20:06.080 --> 20:07.070
We'll follow you.

20:18.910 --> 20:19.920
Here they come!

20:20.090 --> 20:21.580
5-0! Police!

20:23.650 --> 20:25.000
You guys gonna leave me here?

20:25.010 --> 20:26.960
Sit tight. We got real criminals to tend to.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.050
All right, get set.

20:36.050 --> 20:39.980
Ready? Hut, hut, hike!

20:39.980 --> 20:41.870
Come on, let's do another one. Ready?

20:42.230 --> 20:43.020
Hut, hut!

20:44.570 --> 20:47.340
- You touched the car. - No, I didn't.

20:48.590 --> 20:49.710
- He's out of bounds. - I didn't touch it.

20:49.710 --> 20:50.600
You saw it.

20:51.320 --> 20:52.740
He touch the car or not?

20:53.760 --> 20:54.750
Car's out?

20:54.950 --> 20:56.370
Why do you think I'm asking?

20:58.990 --> 21:00.350
Yeah, he brushed it a little.

21:04.970 --> 21:06.130
What'd they get you for?

21:08.270 --> 21:09.370
Killed a man.

21:10.350 --> 21:11.630
Did he deserve it?

21:13.560 --> 21:15.010
I'm innocent, man.

21:16.070 --> 21:17.110
Come on!

21:17.280 --> 21:18.840
- Get out of the way. - Marvin.

21:18.850 --> 21:19.830
Marvin!

21:20.060 --> 21:21.300
Get your ass in here.

21:21.300 --> 21:22.800
You want to get shot out here?

21:22.800 --> 21:24.240
You steer clear of police.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.440
Do you hear me?

21:27.490 --> 21:28.180
Come on, man.

21:28.180 --> 21:30.450
There you go, Ricky. Was that so hard, huh?

21:30.910 --> 21:32.710
Let's go, let's go.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.310
Night driving at your age?

21:47.750 --> 21:48.710
You might want to invest

21:48.720 --> 21:51.080
in a pair of those drugstore spectacles.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.180
What are the explosives for?

21:54.180 --> 21:55.900
To think I was worried you might've actually gotten hurt.

21:55.900 --> 21:57.310
What are they for, Donny?

21:57.310 --> 21:58.900
It's better for you if you don't know.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.400
Tell me now or I'm walking.

22:03.450 --> 22:04.630
You want to help me up?

22:10.320 --> 22:12.630
It's a controlled explosion, all right?

22:12.630 --> 22:14.240
An old warehouse scheduled for demolition.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.040
Nobody gets hurt.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.390
Pick-up, delivery, security. That's what the deal was.

22:17.390 --> 22:19.240
You want to explain to me what happened with Harlee?

22:19.250 --> 22:20.750
I told you, I was wrong.

22:21.380 --> 22:23.100
I need to know if you're still in.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.350
Yeah, you do.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.500
Wozniak owns this place?

22:32.630 --> 22:34.510
The shed, not the marina.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.490
His uncle left it to him.

22:40.130 --> 22:41.770
You met him here last night?

22:43.090 --> 22:45.390
How many fishing boats do you think he has?

22:45.630 --> 22:48.010
And he sent you back here the very next day?

22:49.870 --> 22:50.970
That's messed up.

22:54.300 --> 22:55.790
You're wasting your time searching.

22:55.790 --> 22:57.910
Grunt work like this is what led me to you, Harlee.

22:58.060 --> 22:59.220
Yeah, and now you're wasting my time.

22:59.220 --> 23:01.820
Well, Agent Chen can give you a ride back to your car.

23:05.110 --> 23:06.220
Anna Kate?

23:08.960 --> 23:10.410
Wozniak's daughter.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.600
Right, suicide.

23:13.410 --> 23:15.780
Can't be easy having Wozniak for a father.

23:15.990 --> 23:18.020
She was clinically depressed.

23:18.150 --> 23:19.370
Proving my point.

23:26.300 --> 23:28.370
You suck at foreplay, Saperstein.

23:28.380 --> 23:30.780
Move it. I got to pick Troy up from practice.

23:30.780 --> 23:32.120
How'd it go with Loman?

23:33.660 --> 23:35.400
He wants to live. We confirmed it.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.500
He's cooling off, taking a shower.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.060
Shouldn't you be convalescing?

23:39.480 --> 23:40.650
Listen carefully.

23:40.910 --> 23:42.130
Don't freak out.

23:42.780 --> 23:45.160
But that waitress you assaulted the other night at the bar,

23:45.230 --> 23:46.650
she came in to file a complaint.

23:47.410 --> 23:48.880
That slut's complaining about me?

23:48.880 --> 23:50.350
I talked her down, sort of.

23:50.350 --> 23:52.260
What do you mean you--sort of?

23:52.260 --> 23:54.170
Now all she wants is an apology.

23:55.310 --> 23:56.820
Need someone to play bad cop.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.870
All right, listen up. I am bloated. I'm cramping.

24:04.870 --> 24:07.200
My shoes are killing me, and my husband's cheating on me.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.890
And I have to go apologize to the bitch

24:08.890 --> 24:10.020
that he's been screwing.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.790
I'm gonna kill someone before this day is over.

24:12.790 --> 24:13.940
Bernard did it.

24:17.840 --> 24:20.220
It wasn't right, what he said about Wozniak's daughter.

24:22.930 --> 24:24.700
My cousin committed suicide.

24:26.810 --> 24:27.360
I'm sorry.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.330
His father was a tough guy,

24:29.950 --> 24:33.550
loyal, and a little scary.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.040
You gonna ask me if I know any men like that?

24:37.040 --> 24:38.000
Do you?

24:38.840 --> 24:41.300
Look, you want to know why I've been loyal to Wozniak?

24:41.790 --> 24:42.790
It's simple.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.050
I owe him everything.

24:47.700 --> 24:48.850
I trust him.

24:50.510 --> 24:52.660
Does saying it out loud help you believe it?

25:26.380 --> 25:29.090
They were never gonna let you pull the trigger, you know.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.960
I'm not gonna lie to you, Loman.

25:34.440 --> 25:35.840
You screwed up.

25:36.140 --> 25:38.320
You know it, I know it,

25:38.320 --> 25:39.980
and now the crew knows it.

25:40.150 --> 25:43.720
Don't make this worse by not burying this thing.

25:44.620 --> 25:47.920
Time moves in only one direction.

25:48.420 --> 25:49.440
With all due respect, sir,

25:49.440 --> 25:51.110
I don't get to move on the way you do.

25:51.110 --> 25:52.070
Loman,

25:53.390 --> 25:56.750
I've done the same thing and then some--

25:57.230 --> 26:00.220
justified shootings, but a killing just the same.

26:00.230 --> 26:01.440
It's not the same.

26:02.590 --> 26:03.890
You're a white cop.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.340
On average, how many white perps do you lock up?

26:08.340 --> 26:10.540
I don't know. I don't keep a log.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.950
We're picking up people who look like me

26:12.950 --> 26:15.130
eight times more than people who look like you.

26:15.130 --> 26:16.150
Last I checked,

26:16.150 --> 26:18.950
we're picking up criminals, not crayons.

26:18.960 --> 26:23.070
Sir, you pick up any crayon in the box, it's expected.

26:24.400 --> 26:27.420
I pick the same one, and I'm a Tom, right?

26:27.420 --> 26:28.580
I'm a sellout.

26:29.960 --> 26:31.380
This is my neighborhood,

26:32.590 --> 26:33.250
and to them,

26:33.250 --> 26:35.440
it looks like I chose to side against my own.

26:36.070 --> 26:38.550
Loman, Loman...

26:43.700 --> 26:45.490
We're "your own" now.

26:46.840 --> 26:50.240
What happens to you happens to all of us.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.620
Not some black guy that gives you

26:52.620 --> 26:55.520
an extra dirty look when you book him. Who cares?

26:55.520 --> 26:56.260
I can handle him.

26:56.260 --> 26:59.760
What I can't handle are these kids scattering in the streets

26:59.760 --> 27:01.760
terrified that the police are gonna shoot them.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.710
Taught to be that way.

27:04.310 --> 27:06.960
Nah, someone's got to show them

27:06.960 --> 27:09.480
that being a good cop isn't the exception to the rule.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.390
What, are you saying I'm not a good cop?

27:14.430 --> 27:15.720
I'm a black cop

27:16.100 --> 27:18.060
that shot a black man playing a video game.

27:18.060 --> 27:21.090
Whose bad heroin killed two people--

27:21.090 --> 27:22.620
the people that you're trying to protect.

27:22.620 --> 27:25.170
I didn't know that. I didn't know that.

27:25.170 --> 27:26.760
We don't get to fight a preemptive war.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.250
We don't get to pop people because of what we think

27:28.250 --> 27:31.030
they're gonna do, but it happens all the time.

27:31.690 --> 27:32.650
And that's why they're afraid.

27:32.650 --> 27:34.450
That's why they don't trust us.

27:34.970 --> 27:38.440
Yes, we do not get to shoot people in the head

27:38.440 --> 27:40.970
before we know that they're bad guys.

27:41.120 --> 27:43.500
But make no mistake about this, Loman.

27:43.510 --> 27:47.340
We are absolutely fighting a preemptive war.

27:48.380 --> 27:50.810
That's what policing is.

27:51.710 --> 27:54.360
Now, you're in this for the right reasons.

27:54.390 --> 27:56.990
You've got heart, and you've got balls.

27:58.340 --> 27:59.760
But listen to me.

28:00.080 --> 28:04.750
Sometimes the right decision isn't in the book.

28:11.980 --> 28:13.690
Thought somebody might be following me,

28:14.070 --> 28:16.930
so I parked the van at the marina instead of your storage.

28:17.100 --> 28:18.420
I got it from here.

28:20.190 --> 28:21.640
What are we doing, Woz?

28:21.680 --> 28:23.310
Preparing for a rainy day.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.380
Yeah, well, the clouds are rolling in.

28:25.710 --> 28:27.250
FBI's on our tail.

28:27.770 --> 28:29.550
We go from taking tribute and, what,

28:29.550 --> 28:31.700
keeping peace on the streets, to vans with explosives?

28:32.070 --> 28:33.580
And you're not being straight with me.

28:33.690 --> 28:35.580
It's a security job,

28:35.580 --> 28:37.840
some fat cats moving cash offshore.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.340
It's four hours, one night, in and out.

28:40.340 --> 28:41.090
That's it.

28:41.390 --> 28:42.640
It doesn't fit our criteria.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.580
It's not small. It's not simple--

28:44.580 --> 28:47.890
All we have to worry about is finding the informant.

28:47.890 --> 28:48.640
That's it.

28:49.480 --> 28:52.160
What we were doing before-- before the FBI--

28:52.170 --> 28:53.000
that was enough.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.730
Cristina's college is gonna be $250,000.

28:55.730 --> 28:57.630
You're a single mom on a cop's salary.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.110
It's not enough, Harlee.

28:59.110 --> 29:01.150
Don't pretend like this is for me.

29:01.150 --> 29:02.990
Well, it's for all of us, yes.

29:03.290 --> 29:05.530
I've got five years left till retirement.

29:05.570 --> 29:07.850
I've seen these pension-strapped mopes working security

29:07.850 --> 29:09.650
in parking garages. I'm not gonna do it.

29:09.650 --> 29:11.140
I've worked too hard for that.

29:11.140 --> 29:12.170
Yeah, well, if we do this,

29:12.170 --> 29:13.540
you won't have to worry about your pension.

29:13.540 --> 29:15.150
You'll be spending your twilight years in prison.

29:15.150 --> 29:17.150
Harlee, I put you through a lot last night.

29:17.150 --> 29:18.550
And I'll make it up to you, I promise.

29:18.550 --> 29:20.030
This isn't about that.

29:20.650 --> 29:22.490
Look, the crew's got a line

29:22.490 --> 29:23.630
on the knifeman from the robbery.

29:23.630 --> 29:25.660
Guy's got a history of domestic abuse.

29:26.050 --> 29:28.520
You take Loman, you go talk to the ex.

29:29.250 --> 29:32.000
Make him feel useful.

29:32.000 --> 29:32.500
Woz.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.340
Then you can clock out after that.

29:34.680 --> 29:35.420
Woz!

29:35.800 --> 29:36.550
Thank you.

29:42.360 --> 29:45.140
So, different bar job, same skanky little getup, huh?

29:46.500 --> 29:48.550
Is that crazy person for "I'm sorry?"

29:49.270 --> 29:50.200
So let me get this straight.

29:50.200 --> 29:51.910
Your life can't go on without an apology?

29:51.910 --> 29:53.850
You could have blinded me, bitch.

29:53.850 --> 29:55.310
No, no, honey, you're already blind,

29:55.310 --> 29:56.490
prancing around in your little mini skirt,

29:56.490 --> 29:58.580
ruining people's lives 'cause you're dumb and horny.

29:58.590 --> 29:59.680
You can blame me all you want,

29:59.690 --> 30:02.410
but your husband came after me, not the other way around.

30:03.690 --> 30:06.890
You are nothing but sweat and friction--a blow-up doll.

30:06.900 --> 30:08.280
You realize that, don't you?

30:08.550 --> 30:09.990
He used you.

30:10.080 --> 30:13.030
Yeah, over and over again,

30:13.030 --> 30:15.630
and I loved every sweaty minute of it.

30:15.660 --> 30:16.740
This isn't an apology.

30:16.740 --> 30:17.860
I'm pressing charges.

30:17.860 --> 30:18.730
Just, just--

30:20.090 --> 30:21.730
Do you know how hard I've worked to keep

30:21.730 --> 30:23.140
my marriage afloat?

30:23.500 --> 30:25.620
No, and I don't care.

30:26.070 --> 30:29.550
But if it's that hard, maybe it's broken.

30:33.210 --> 30:34.210
Unbelievable.

30:36.590 --> 30:38.630
You're right. You're right.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.180
About what?

30:40.180 --> 30:41.720
Don't you worry about it.

30:44.820 --> 30:45.930
You want an apology? Here you go.

30:45.930 --> 30:48.200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I kicked your ass.

30:48.710 --> 30:51.410
All right, whatever. Just leave.

30:51.410 --> 30:53.350
I'm not done. I'm sorry for more than that.

30:53.350 --> 30:55.400
I am sorry that someday you're gonna be struggling

30:55.400 --> 30:56.720
to keep that body of yours.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.060
And you're gonna be buying miracle creams and bras,

30:59.060 --> 31:01.630
just to prove that the kids didn't suck the bounce out of you,

31:01.630 --> 31:04.750
doing everything you can to keep your husband still interested.

31:04.860 --> 31:07.460
And then some dumb little girl's gonna come along

31:07.520 --> 31:09.920
and prove just how desperate you've become

31:10.920 --> 31:12.820
and just how much time you've wasted.

31:14.890 --> 31:17.020
That is really gonna suck for you.

31:25.530 --> 31:27.940
Oh, sorry.

31:27.940 --> 31:28.750
Am I early?

31:29.430 --> 31:30.080
No.

31:33.230 --> 31:33.870
Come in.

31:41.480 --> 31:44.500
This is the most orderly male apartment I've seen.

31:44.570 --> 31:45.560
Are you OCD?

31:45.570 --> 31:47.100
The marina shed was clean.

31:48.090 --> 31:49.830
Did Wozniak's uncle own anything else?

31:49.830 --> 31:51.270
Passed away in 2008.

31:51.480 --> 31:53.880
No other properties or rentals in his name.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.110
I did make progress with Harlee, though.

31:58.340 --> 31:59.730
Got her to talk about Wozniak.

31:59.730 --> 32:01.660
Nothing we didn't know, but it's a start.

32:02.850 --> 32:04.140
How'd you get her to open up?

32:04.630 --> 32:06.620
I told her my cousin committed suicide.

32:07.450 --> 32:08.730
I'm sorry to hear that.

32:08.980 --> 32:10.190
It's not actually true.

32:11.270 --> 32:12.620
I've just found that empathy building

32:12.620 --> 32:13.890
is the most successful--

32:13.890 --> 32:14.670
His daughter.

32:15.520 --> 32:16.110
What?

32:16.510 --> 32:18.000
His daughter, Anna Kate.

32:18.010 --> 32:19.260
You checked out the rental history

32:19.260 --> 32:20.440
of the wrong dead relative.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.720
We should search for storage units under her name.

32:23.770 --> 32:25.280
The knifeman from the robbery used to

32:25.280 --> 32:26.260
live with this woman.

32:26.420 --> 32:28.450
- You think she'll help us? - Hope so.

32:28.500 --> 32:29.690
Used to punch her too.

32:34.000 --> 32:34.810
You ready for this?

32:36.130 --> 32:37.220
I'm ready to do my job.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.920
Silvia Johnston, we're looking for Bernard Perkins.

32:46.920 --> 32:48.850
Bernard's not here. I-I don't know where he is.

32:50.230 --> 32:52.390
That golf ball under your eye suggests differently.

32:52.390 --> 32:53.420
He didn't do this.

32:53.900 --> 32:55.420
I haven't seen him in months.

32:56.350 --> 32:58.380
Look, I'd feel better if you'd open the door

32:58.380 --> 32:59.410
and let us take a look.

33:00.720 --> 33:01.810
You got a warrant?

33:02.370 --> 33:03.660
Didn't think to get one.

33:03.850 --> 33:05.500
Then get your foot out of my house.

33:09.960 --> 33:10.710
He's in there.

33:11.890 --> 33:12.530
Yep.

33:14.300 --> 33:15.530
This is Detective Santos

33:15.530 --> 33:17.200
requesting forcible entry warrant.

33:17.200 --> 33:17.970
Where are you going?

33:18.350 --> 33:19.950
Best case, this takes till tomorrow.

33:19.950 --> 33:21.350
Tomorrow? Did you see her face?

33:22.160 --> 33:23.940
Yeah, and I also heard what she said.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.980
- Probably the TV. - You saw her eye.

33:29.980 --> 33:31.000
He's knocking her around.

33:31.960 --> 33:34.690
Look, by law, there's nothing we can do.

33:36.670 --> 33:37.720
This is ridiculous.

33:39.250 --> 33:40.330
Unless...

33:42.420 --> 33:43.020
What?

33:43.880 --> 33:45.070
You heard a cry for help.

33:47.010 --> 33:49.170
Oh, come on, Harlee.

33:49.170 --> 33:51.370
Did you hear a cry for help, Loman?

33:57.370 --> 33:58.200
Yes.

34:00.880 --> 34:01.780
Are you sure?

34:03.140 --> 34:04.870
You understand what I'm asking you?

34:06.080 --> 34:09.280
Yes, I heard a cry for help.

34:09.820 --> 34:10.719
All right, then.

34:19.460 --> 34:20.090
Loman...

34:21.929 --> 34:23.420
don't blow anybody's head off.

34:24.820 --> 34:25.420
Right.

34:32.489 --> 34:33.250
Don't worry.

34:33.690 --> 34:35.810
Your story plus my story puts him away easy.

34:35.810 --> 34:36.760
What are you looking at?

34:37.650 --> 34:39.190
You want to go another round, bitch?

34:39.190 --> 34:40.300
You didn't hear, Bernard?

34:40.320 --> 34:42.130
That bitch tapped out. I'm in the ring now.

34:42.130 --> 34:43.630
You ain't stabbing people at the bodega.

34:43.630 --> 34:45.500
- You're in my house. - Can't hide behind you forever.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.710
That punk's gonna have to see me on the block!

34:47.710 --> 34:49.520
In the cell block, then you're headed for the other one.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.920
Didn't your mother tell you not to stab people?

34:50.920 --> 34:51.900
My mama did.

34:53.139 --> 34:54.050
She's scared.

34:54.130 --> 34:56.969
You know, he's a paycheck with a fist.

34:57.050 --> 34:59.070
I suggested she find one without the other.

35:04.810 --> 35:06.500
What's Wozniak's daughter's birthday?

35:07.060 --> 35:08.380
02-19.

35:20.350 --> 35:21.560
It's macabre,

35:22.240 --> 35:24.790
renting a storage unit in your dead daughter's name.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.990
Guess it makes sense if you're building a shrine.

35:35.710 --> 35:37.010
Hang on. I got something here.

35:43.370 --> 35:44.630
Four counting machines.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.410
How much cash are they expecting?

35:46.410 --> 35:48.610
Each counts close to 1,000 $100 bills a minute.

36:01.110 --> 36:01.800
Boom.

36:33.750 --> 36:34.380
Hi.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.630
You came to return my bakeware?

36:39.630 --> 36:42.250
Please tell your daughter she's a culinary genius.

36:42.630 --> 36:45.080
- Is that her playing? - Yes.

36:45.300 --> 36:47.670
Wow. Bakeware aside,

36:47.670 --> 36:50.110
I came to tell you I looked into the case you mentioned--

36:50.110 --> 36:51.720
the guy you dated, Miguel Zepeda.

36:51.720 --> 36:53.500
How strong is his appeal?

36:53.680 --> 36:55.020
I'm waiting to hear back from his lawyer,

36:55.020 --> 36:56.970
but they don't have to tell us anything until the hearing,

36:56.970 --> 36:58.540
which is set for ten days from now.

36:58.540 --> 36:59.600
I thought you'd want to know.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.350
Yeah, thank you for the information.

37:03.190 --> 37:04.820
You want to come in and have a glass of wine?

37:04.820 --> 37:05.440
Yes.

37:06.790 --> 37:08.150
Which is why I shouldn't.

37:08.850 --> 37:11.560
Oh. Is the weather getting better in New Canaan?

37:13.250 --> 37:15.240
Look, if I would've known that you and her were still--

37:15.240 --> 37:15.900
We're not.

37:17.710 --> 37:19.290
But based on what happened last night,

37:19.290 --> 37:21.900
I should probably not come in.

37:25.170 --> 37:26.440
Well, then, I'm gonna come out.

37:27.540 --> 37:28.450
Give me a sec.

37:28.650 --> 37:29.720
She's just a kid.

37:30.920 --> 37:31.820
She's ballsy.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.660
I was like that 20 years ago.

37:36.130 --> 37:37.950
I want to know why he needs her,

37:38.810 --> 37:39.920
and why I'm not enough.

37:42.850 --> 37:45.740
Look, I got a lot of reasons to hate your husband,

37:45.900 --> 37:47.620
but even I don't think that's what he'd say.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.330
Well, you've never been married.

37:51.330 --> 37:52.670
You don't know how bad it can get.

37:53.610 --> 37:54.640
What do I know?

37:56.440 --> 37:59.440
All I know is, a woman like you,

38:00.480 --> 38:02.110
you're worth all the bad in the world.

38:20.780 --> 38:22.120
- Hey. - Sup?

38:22.130 --> 38:23.960
- Nothing much. How you doing? - I got you something.

38:26.270 --> 38:27.850
Yeah, now you can do some reading after lights out.

38:27.850 --> 38:30.300
That's what's up! How much it cost?

38:30.300 --> 38:32.710
Hey, you know you don't ask that about a gift.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.260
Sorry. This is awesome. Thank you.

38:35.260 --> 38:36.890
Why don't you run down the hall and show Marcus?

38:36.890 --> 38:37.610
Okay.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.610
- Hi. - Hi.

38:42.290 --> 38:43.000
You know, I can show you how to

38:43.000 --> 38:44.690
borrow some e-books from the library.

38:45.410 --> 38:46.520
Oh, my God.

38:47.500 --> 38:48.820
What did they do to you?

38:48.820 --> 38:49.580
It's nothing.

38:51.190 --> 38:51.820
Come on.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.860
You, uh...you cold?

38:58.460 --> 39:01.900
Mm, do you throw your cloak over mud puddles

39:01.900 --> 39:03.590
for ladies to walk across?

39:04.150 --> 39:06.530
My cloak--if I wore a cloak,

39:06.540 --> 39:08.900
I don't think any ladies would be sitting anywhere near me.

39:11.770 --> 39:16.410
So, this type of hearing that Miguel has--

39:16.410 --> 39:19.600
do people ever get released after one of them?

39:20.420 --> 39:21.200
Not often.

39:22.150 --> 39:24.350
The convicts rarely meet the burden of proof.

39:24.650 --> 39:29.130
But we'll bring up his criminal record, his history of violence.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.600
Look, I know you were young when you got together,

39:34.600 --> 39:37.870
but I don't know how a woman like you

39:37.870 --> 39:39.540
would ever be with a guy like that.

39:45.060 --> 39:47.280
He was a big deal in the neighborhood.

39:50.840 --> 39:52.060
Ran his own crew.

39:56.640 --> 39:57.630
He had power.

40:04.030 --> 40:05.280
And he made me feel safe.

40:09.530 --> 40:10.170
At first.

40:15.790 --> 40:17.790
Like nothing bad could happen to me,

40:17.860 --> 40:19.510
'cause I was under his protection.

40:21.140 --> 40:21.850
I don't know.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.180
Why do we do any of the messed up things we do,

40:26.180 --> 40:27.850
and tell ourselves it's okay?

40:29.360 --> 40:32.590
Who we think we are and who we turn out to be--

40:34.980 --> 40:36.180
are they ever the same?

40:37.520 --> 40:41.240
Best we can hope for is another day

40:41.240 --> 40:42.050
to try to get it right.

40:42.460 --> 40:43.580
So you gonna tell me?

40:44.500 --> 40:45.120
What?

40:45.630 --> 40:48.030
Why did the police drag you out of the funeral like that?

40:50.950 --> 40:51.850
I did things.

40:55.440 --> 40:56.630
Bad things.

40:59.110 --> 41:00.260
Haven't we all?

41:02.400 --> 41:03.860
Crooked-ass police,

41:04.790 --> 41:07.050
running around like a bunch of murderers.

41:12.680 --> 41:16.680
Yeah, murderers.

41:17.305 --> 41:23.677
