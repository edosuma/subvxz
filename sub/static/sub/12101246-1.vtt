WEBVTT

01:21.590 --> 01:25.260
The time of the imperialists

01:25.552 --> 01:28.544
will soon come to an end.

01:30.432 --> 01:33.060
They speak...

01:35.145 --> 01:38.983
...speak as if they want to frighten us.

01:40.943 --> 01:44.363
But they only scare themselves.

01:45.072 --> 01:47.199
They know...

01:47.324 --> 01:50.452
...They know that our nuclear arsenal

01:51.787 --> 01:54.623
is only getting stronger every day.

01:57.710 --> 01:59.211
And I have already said...

02:01.463 --> 02:04.508
And I will say it again,

02:04.591 --> 02:07.469
We... Will...

02:07.802 --> 02:10.389
...bury them!

02:53.800 --> 02:55.635
- Yeah, sure.
- Then what?

02:55.668 --> 02:57.502
We can get tickets for something to see?

02:58.603 --> 03:00.539
- We can see the symphony.
- Huh?

03:00.907 --> 03:02.074
It'll finish really late.

03:02.607 --> 03:04.076
We can catch the last train, huh?

03:09.490 --> 03:11.492
Daddy, I got my pin.

03:12.242 --> 03:14.244
I'm a Little Octobrist.

03:25.047 --> 03:26.757
Wear it here...

03:27.925 --> 03:29.927
by your heart.

03:48.487 --> 03:50.572
I have to go out for a little while.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.243
I won't wake you.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.579
You can wake me.

04:12.111 --> 04:13.746
Excuse me. Could you give me a light?

04:14.479 --> 04:15.614
Yeah, sure.

04:16.782 --> 04:18.184
You're Americans, yes?

04:18.217 --> 04:20.119
Yes, sir. We're on a summer trip.

04:22.688 --> 04:25.858
Please, take this to your embassy.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.761
It is vital. I have no other way.

04:28.961 --> 04:30.062
Come on. Let's get out of here.

04:30.096 --> 04:32.765
Do not go back to your hotel,
straight to the embassy.

04:33.032 --> 04:35.134
Give this only to Deputy Chief of Mission.

04:35.801 --> 04:36.936
Understand?

04:51.342 --> 04:52.968
I'm an American citizen.

05:28.154 --> 05:29.587
- Thank you.
- Mm.

05:30.256 --> 05:32.692
- Emily. Lovely as ever.
- Ah!

05:32.892 --> 05:34.526
You do brighten up the old place.

05:34.559 --> 05:35.493
Oh, thank you.

05:35.728 --> 05:36.796
- Emily?
- Sir.

05:36.829 --> 05:37.964
- Please sit down.
- Ah.

05:39.597 --> 05:41.968
I've brought you boys a present.

05:51.210 --> 05:52.712
Ah, thank you.

05:54.847 --> 05:56.115
Rachel, step out.

06:01.954 --> 06:04.790
I fear a nuclear war is coming

06:05.124 --> 06:06.859
and I want to help you prevent it.

06:08.027 --> 06:09.261
It's got my attention.

06:10.663 --> 06:11.964
He's smart.

06:11.998 --> 06:14.000
Gave us a photo only we'd have copies of

06:14.333 --> 06:16.802
from a few years ago in
our embassy in Turkey.

06:17.303 --> 06:22.742
Say hello to Colonel Oleg
Vladimirovich Penkovsky.

06:22.975 --> 06:24.744
Code name "Ironbark".

06:24.777 --> 06:26.645
Artillery officer during the war,

06:26.679 --> 06:28.546
decorated 13 times.

06:28.814 --> 06:29.547
Now he's back in Moscow

06:29.949 --> 06:31.917
running the State Committee
for Scientific Research.

06:32.251 --> 06:33.618
But that's just a cover.

06:35.154 --> 06:36.655
He's GRU.

06:41.894 --> 06:43.095
Why they toss him?

06:43.796 --> 06:45.898
Hand like this I keep place to my chest.

06:45.931 --> 06:47.867
Because they have no way to make contact.

06:48.067 --> 06:50.803
The CIA is weak in Moscow after that...

06:51.237 --> 06:54.040
disaster with Popov. Am I right?

06:54.974 --> 06:58.244
We're thin on the
ground. We need your help.

07:00.646 --> 07:01.347
Let's get him out.

07:01.814 --> 07:03.849
We've got a number of good
officers in our embassy.

07:03.883 --> 07:05.985
I'll have one make contact with Penkovsky,

07:06.018 --> 07:08.120
- get this sorted out.
- I did have a thought.

07:09.321 --> 07:12.758
This is a GRU Colonel. He's so visible.

07:12.792 --> 07:14.026
I'm worried we could blow Penkovsky

07:14.060 --> 07:15.294
just by making an approach.

07:15.795 --> 07:19.198
That's always a risk. What
would the CIA have us do instead?

07:20.166 --> 07:21.200
I don't know.

07:21.500 --> 07:25.071
Maybe use someone outside the embassy

07:25.538 --> 07:28.007
who the KGB won't suspect?

07:28.474 --> 07:31.877
Say a businessman who travels
to that part of the world.

07:32.078 --> 07:35.948
Do we know of someone
who could fit the bill?

07:36.482 --> 07:37.383
I have to warn you,

07:37.416 --> 07:40.853
I have a pretty good feeling about this.

07:43.155 --> 07:44.190
Oh, hell.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.993
And Greville, that is the saddest thing

07:48.194 --> 07:49.695
I've ever seen.

07:49.728 --> 07:51.864
Well, serves me right,

07:51.897 --> 07:53.966
I should keep my mouth shut.

07:54.567 --> 07:56.235
Now we have to make it up.

07:57.736 --> 07:59.705
We probably have some brochures.

07:59.905 --> 08:00.840
Of what?

08:01.040 --> 08:02.374
A drink first, I think.

08:05.845 --> 08:07.213
You know my reputation.

08:07.513 --> 08:09.348
Parts I want you to know anyway.

08:09.815 --> 08:12.084
I represent the top manufacturers

08:12.118 --> 08:14.186
who sell the best products on the market.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.389
So in combination with you
gentlemen knowing your business,

08:17.423 --> 08:18.791
I think it'd be much better if

08:18.824 --> 08:20.159
instead of my usual song and dance.

08:20.593 --> 08:23.162
I just listen. You tell
me what your problems are,

08:23.529 --> 08:26.298
and if I think I have a client
that may have a solution,

08:26.799 --> 08:30.136
let's talk it through. If
not, let's keep drinking.

08:31.103 --> 08:32.905
So tell me, what do you need?

08:33.772 --> 08:35.741
- Thanks, Greville.
- Bye.

09:06.906 --> 09:08.941
It still doesn't add up.

09:08.974 --> 09:11.243
Well, did you miss something maybe?

09:12.678 --> 09:14.980
- Like carrying the four?
- Oh, yes.

09:15.014 --> 09:16.782
- Oh, yes.
- How are you?

09:17.016 --> 09:19.852
Oh, very well. Except
our son keeps confusing me

09:19.885 --> 09:22.087
helping with his homework
with me doing it for him.

09:22.121 --> 09:22.821
Oh.

09:23.155 --> 09:25.090
- How was your day?
- Oh, the usual.

09:25.124 --> 09:27.459
Some empty flatteries
and blatant sucking up.

09:27.693 --> 09:29.128
No, really, you should have seen me.

09:29.328 --> 09:32.031
I sold a dozen lace by
throwing the easiest putt

09:32.064 --> 09:33.332
in the history of putting.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.167
- I feel filthy.
- No. No.

09:35.201 --> 09:36.702
You have to play golf badly.

09:37.236 --> 09:39.104
- But aren't you used to that?
- Uh-huh!

09:39.471 --> 09:41.440
Well, just think another 23 years of this

09:41.473 --> 09:42.942
and then we're off to the good life.

09:43.475 --> 09:45.211
Or I could retire early.

09:45.511 --> 09:47.880
Andrew, you don't want to
go to university, do you?

09:47.913 --> 09:49.315
Not really.

09:49.348 --> 09:50.849
- Perfect.
- Well, I'm not feeding

09:50.883 --> 09:52.051
either of you.

09:52.551 --> 09:53.485
Then what you're smiling at?

09:53.519 --> 09:55.454
Be at least 50 years until you can retire.

09:55.487 --> 09:57.990
- <i>Greville Wynne, please?</i>
- Yeah. Let me see if he's home.

09:58.724 --> 10:02.194
- Sounds like work.
- No. Tell them I'm in my chair.

10:02.828 --> 10:04.830
Yes. He's just walked in.

10:11.103 --> 10:14.440
- Greville Wynne.
- <i>Greville, this is James Dobie</i>

10:14.473 --> 10:16.809
<i>from the Board of
Trade. We met last year.</i>

10:16.842 --> 10:18.777
Yes. Yes. At the reception of Whitehall.

10:18.811 --> 10:20.846
James. How good to hear from you.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.948
- James, hello.
- Greville.

10:24.116 --> 10:24.850
I hope you don't mind.

10:25.251 --> 10:27.886
My friend Helen is a
consultant in from the States.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.255
I thought, "Why not?"

10:29.521 --> 10:31.457
Greville Wynne. A real pleasure.

10:31.490 --> 10:33.259
Helen Talbot, likewise.

10:35.828 --> 10:38.030
James tells me you've been
working in Eastern Europe.

10:38.063 --> 10:40.833
Hmm. More and more,
tremendous opportunities.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.102
Plenty of demand, no local supplies.

10:43.569 --> 10:46.238
Czechoslovakia, Hungary.

10:46.805 --> 10:49.108
Ghastly food.

10:49.676 --> 10:51.277
What about the Soviet Union?

10:51.310 --> 10:52.945
Oh, not just yet. Someday.

10:53.279 --> 10:55.281
I'd like to see temperatures
cool off a bit first.

10:55.314 --> 10:57.049
Actually now might be the perfect time.

10:57.249 --> 10:59.018
Oh, really? Why? What did you hear?

10:59.385 --> 11:01.053
Well, Helen and I have associates

11:01.086 --> 11:03.289
who would be interested to
see what might come of it.

11:05.524 --> 11:07.493
It would be a real
service to Great Britain.

11:08.527 --> 11:09.862
And the world.

11:26.512 --> 11:28.080
Forgive me. I'm just a bit...

11:31.150 --> 11:33.185
Sorry. James, I know you said you had

11:33.218 --> 11:35.054
an office in Board of Trade.

11:36.088 --> 11:37.189
But...

11:38.023 --> 11:39.958
Is it possible that you actually work...

11:40.592 --> 11:43.329
at a different branch of
Her Majesty's government?

11:47.466 --> 11:48.534
Oh, my.

11:51.403 --> 11:52.838
This is unexpected.

11:54.206 --> 11:56.975
Sorry, I... I don't understand.

11:57.009 --> 11:59.945
Why, I'm... I'm... I'm just a salesman.

12:00.179 --> 12:02.581
Exactly. An ordinary salesman

12:02.614 --> 12:04.450
with no connection to the government.

12:04.483 --> 12:06.585
Look, this is all fascinating.
I mean, I really can't believe

12:06.618 --> 12:10.122
I'm actually having lunch with spies.

12:11.156 --> 12:12.224
But...

12:14.159 --> 12:16.161
...I couldn't possibly...

12:20.366 --> 12:24.103
- What would you want me to do?
- Nothing dodgy, nothing illegal,

12:24.370 --> 12:25.871
just what you would naturally do.

12:26.105 --> 12:27.373
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

12:27.841 --> 12:29.174
Someone in your field

12:29.508 --> 12:31.644
hoping to do business in the Soviet Union,

12:32.111 --> 12:33.379
how would you get started?

12:35.114 --> 12:36.148
Well, I suppose I'd set up

12:36.181 --> 12:37.950
a meeting with the State Committee

12:37.983 --> 12:40.018
for Scientific Research in Moscow.

12:40.653 --> 12:42.054
That sounds fine.

12:42.521 --> 12:46.325
So you want me to go to Moscow and then...

12:48.260 --> 12:49.261
Do business.

12:53.098 --> 12:55.100
All this secrecy must seem absurd

12:55.134 --> 12:56.502
but I promise, it's to help you.

12:56.535 --> 12:58.137
We want you to act exactly like

12:58.170 --> 12:59.071
the ordinary businessman you are.

12:59.338 --> 13:01.507
That'll be much easier if
you don't know any details.

13:01.540 --> 13:03.375
Right. But would I be
putting myself in danger?

13:03.409 --> 13:05.043
That detail, I... I have to know.

13:05.244 --> 13:07.146
Greville, let me put this delicately,

13:07.179 --> 13:08.347
you're a middle-aged businessman

13:08.380 --> 13:11.651
who drinks a bit too much and
isn't exactly in top shape.

13:11.684 --> 13:13.118
During the war, you were a private,

13:13.152 --> 13:14.687
never even saw combat.

13:15.053 --> 13:18.524
My point is, if this mission
was the least bit dangerous,

13:18.758 --> 13:21.093
you really are the last man we'd send.

13:21.728 --> 13:24.363
Well, thank you for
putting it so delicately.

13:29.435 --> 13:31.336
Make sure you wear it
while you're in Moscow.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.940
What does this do? Shoot poison dart?

13:35.240 --> 13:37.209
Thank you so much,
Greville. You're a good man.

13:37.242 --> 13:39.511
And I know we can count
on you to be discreet.

13:45.184 --> 13:46.285
<i>How's your day?</i>

13:47.319 --> 13:50.322
<i>Oh, it was fine.</i>

13:52.591 --> 13:55.127
Mine was wonderful. Thank
you so much for asking.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.463
So sorry, I've got a
head full of contracts.

13:59.331 --> 14:02.000
Uh. You out with, uh, Tomado, weren't you?

14:02.034 --> 14:04.737
Yes, we were at the club,
planning the charity dinner.

14:04.938 --> 14:06.472
- That was amusing.
- Huh!

14:06.972 --> 14:10.142
Before you ask if you have to
come, yes, you have to come.

14:12.478 --> 14:15.380
- I've had an interesting lead.
- Really?

14:15.414 --> 14:17.784
Might look at doing a little
bit of work in the Soviet Union.

14:17.817 --> 14:20.986
Hmm. Do stay out of The Gulag, darling.

14:39.847 --> 14:43.642
I wish moments like
this were not necessary.

14:44.268 --> 14:46.520
But it seems they are.

14:47.646 --> 14:49.940
As you all know, Major Popov

14:50.024 --> 14:52.568
was caught spying for the Americans.

14:53.527 --> 14:55.237
We must all remember...

14:55.321 --> 14:57.364
...the consequences of treason.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.736
<i>How do you do? Greville
Wynne, pleasure.</i>

16:49.769 --> 16:51.403
How do you do? Greville Wynne, pleasure.

16:51.904 --> 16:53.472
How do you do? How do you do?

16:53.505 --> 16:55.207
And this is the head of our committee,

16:55.240 --> 16:56.375
Oleg Penkovsky.

16:56.575 --> 16:58.243
Ah, pleasure to meet you.

16:58.645 --> 16:59.712
Thank you for coming.

17:00.046 --> 17:02.682
I'm not here to tell you

17:02.715 --> 17:04.616
what is best for Soviet industry.

17:09.488 --> 17:12.357
You gentlemen know that
far better than I ever will.

17:15.227 --> 17:18.530
I'm here simply to open a door...

17:22.068 --> 17:25.470
...to the top manufacturers in the West.

17:38.417 --> 17:41.353
Your proposal is interesting.

17:42.722 --> 17:45.323
- Would you like to have lunch?
- Of course...

17:46.391 --> 17:47.526
after you.

17:49.561 --> 17:50.763
<i>It is good you have dealt</i>

17:50.797 --> 17:52.397
<i>with other communist governments</i>

17:52.431 --> 17:53.666
but so far from home.

17:54.232 --> 17:56.268
Do you not prefer to work in England?

17:56.301 --> 17:58.638
I do what I can to keep things interesting.

18:00.238 --> 18:03.743
But then, there's the political situation.

18:05.310 --> 18:06.979
This is not good time for East and West.

18:07.647 --> 18:09.949
Well, what I like to say is no matter what

18:09.982 --> 18:11.150
the politicians are doing,

18:11.184 --> 18:16.421
factories still need machines,
machines still need parts.

18:16.989 --> 18:19.659
I'm a businessman, so I stick to business.

18:25.998 --> 18:27.265
Hmm!

18:31.336 --> 18:35.007
- Do you have a family?
- I do, a boy, he's ten.

18:35.307 --> 18:38.276
I wanted a boy very much,
then we had a girl...

18:38.911 --> 18:39.679
now she's my world.

18:40.046 --> 18:42.782
Mm. Likely not destroying
your home like our son.

18:49.554 --> 18:52.624
Now... most important question.

18:53.793 --> 18:55.527
If you want to do business in Moscow,

18:55.862 --> 18:56.996
I need to know...

18:57.864 --> 18:58.865
Yes?

19:00.599 --> 19:02.267
...can you hold your alcohol?

19:06.005 --> 19:10.308
It's my one true gift.

19:22.722 --> 19:25.057
I want to show you another side of Russia.

19:25.091 --> 19:26.993
- Are you free this evening?
- Certainly.

19:27.226 --> 19:28.628
Where are we off to?

19:47.546 --> 19:48.948
Do you know Cinderella?

19:51.918 --> 19:54.419
Embarrassed to say, I've
never been to the ballet.

19:55.554 --> 19:57.924
Then your trip is already worth it.

19:59.759 --> 20:01.393
If you will, mister.

20:12.772 --> 20:15.407
Shh!

21:21.007 --> 21:22.942
Your tie clip, I like it.

21:23.376 --> 21:24.777
Where did you get it?

21:28.513 --> 21:30.448
It was a gift from a friend.

21:30.883 --> 21:34.519
- Is your friend American?
- Yes.

21:38.057 --> 21:39.491
We can talk here.

21:40.558 --> 21:41.593
It is safe.

21:43.629 --> 21:45.932
I sent word to your friend, you're, um...

21:46.132 --> 21:49.869
- I think the word is "amateur".
- Yes, exactly. Amateur.

21:52.537 --> 21:56.008
I've dreamt of this moment for
a very long time. Thank you.

21:56.342 --> 21:58.110
I wish I could tell
you how much this means.

21:58.144 --> 22:00.680
I think I'd rather that you didn't tell me.

22:02.815 --> 22:03.950
What happens now?

22:05.084 --> 22:06.886
I don't need to do anything, do I?

22:06.919 --> 22:08.120
No, you go home.

22:08.154 --> 22:10.022
Then you invite me to visit London

22:10.056 --> 22:12.792
with a trade delegation
to meet your clients.

22:13.159 --> 22:14.794
Your government would allow you?

22:14.827 --> 22:16.195
They would be thrilled.

22:16.796 --> 22:19.198
Part of my job is to steal technology

22:19.231 --> 22:22.702
from the West. Your friend is clever.

22:24.136 --> 22:26.839
Well, Oleg. May I call you Oleg?

22:27.073 --> 22:29.075
In English, my name doesn't sound good.

22:29.308 --> 22:30.743
Call me Alex.

22:31.944 --> 22:33.079
Alex.

22:39.051 --> 22:40.585
You're a good amateur.

22:58.804 --> 23:00.538
Since you took me to the Bolshoi,

23:00.572 --> 23:02.041
I suppose I should take all of you

23:02.074 --> 23:03.608
to the West End.

23:04.143 --> 23:06.078
Some of the finest theater in the world.

23:06.112 --> 23:07.579
That would be good.

23:20.625 --> 23:23.528
Decadent Westerners.

23:23.763 --> 23:25.296
This is why they are weak.

23:25.342 --> 23:31.170
Eh, comrade Penkovsky?

23:36.842 --> 23:38.744
And this is my wife, Sheila.

23:38.778 --> 23:40.146
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

23:40.179 --> 23:43.249
- <i>Nostrovia!</i>
- <i>Nostrovia!</i>

23:43.548 --> 23:44.817
Cheers!

23:45.284 --> 23:46.919
Up yours, as well. That's another one.

23:47.219 --> 23:48.788
- Up yours!
- Up yours!

23:48.821 --> 23:49.855
- Up yours!
- Up yours!

24:28.961 --> 24:31.063
- Off you go.
- Hello.

24:31.297 --> 24:32.665
Hello, goodbye.

26:04.190 --> 26:05.357
<i>We know you're a patriot.</i>

26:05.724 --> 26:08.194
We know how hard this must be for you.

26:10.529 --> 26:12.431
Colonel, whatever brought you here...

26:13.532 --> 26:17.203
it must frighten you more
than the danger of being here.

26:23.342 --> 26:24.276
Khrushchev.

26:26.078 --> 26:27.446
Khrushchev frightens me.

26:29.114 --> 26:31.784
He is impulsive, chaotic,

26:31.817 --> 26:34.420
a man like him should
have no clear command.

26:36.121 --> 26:37.856
The West has fallen for his lie.

26:38.357 --> 26:41.427
A lie that Soviet regime
is growing soft, it is not.

26:41.927 --> 26:45.197
Khrushchev wants
confrontation with America.

26:45.497 --> 26:47.233
He's looking for one.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.202
Do you have anything
you could share with us,

26:50.236 --> 26:51.337
documents, perhaps?

26:52.972 --> 26:54.473
Would you like to read the new edition

26:54.506 --> 26:55.975
of <i>Military Thought?</i>

27:01.113 --> 27:02.982
I need assurances from you.

27:06.085 --> 27:07.519
If it becomes necessary...

27:08.187 --> 27:10.789
I must able to defect with my family.

27:10.823 --> 27:12.992
Absolutely. Whenever you want.

27:14.593 --> 27:16.262
I will remain in place...

27:16.929 --> 27:19.265
and keep you updated on
the Kremlin's thinking.

27:20.232 --> 27:21.967
But tell your government...

27:23.936 --> 27:26.372
they must use my information wisely.

27:26.740 --> 27:28.040
Not as a weapon...

27:29.508 --> 27:31.910
but as a tool to bring peace.

27:50.062 --> 27:52.264
Despite what Khrushchev claims,

27:52.732 --> 27:57.870
America's nuclear arsenal is
still far superior to ours.

27:58.404 --> 28:01.173
We do not yet have first strike capacity.

28:01.440 --> 28:04.243
You can annihilate us but
we cannot annihilate you.

28:05.311 --> 28:07.179
But that won't worry the Politburo.

28:07.781 --> 28:10.282
Do you think in the end
that'll keep Khrushchev

28:10.316 --> 28:11.850
from going too far?

28:14.553 --> 28:16.322
You have to be up in a few hours.

28:16.355 --> 28:18.590
- I'm fine.
- No, he's right.

28:18.792 --> 28:20.459
We can finish this up tomorrow night.

28:22.629 --> 28:24.129
And one last thing...

28:25.431 --> 28:26.999
we need to talk about Greville.

28:27.599 --> 28:30.102
Don't worry. You won't have
to deal with him anymore.

28:34.506 --> 28:37.343
- No.
- It was Penkovsky's idea.

28:37.376 --> 28:38.911
You're perfect, you're a civilian,

28:38.944 --> 28:39.813
so the KGB won't be watching you.

28:40.179 --> 28:42.948
You'll be in and out of Moscow
anyway to setup contracts.

28:43.449 --> 28:45.117
You still won't know any specifics,

28:45.150 --> 28:46.185
you'll just be a courier.

28:46.218 --> 28:48.220
Just a courier for Russian sea...

28:51.323 --> 28:53.359
My God, I can't believe
you're bloody serious.

28:53.859 --> 28:55.427
We've gone over it with Penkovsky.

28:55.461 --> 28:57.496
We believe the risk to you is minimal.

28:57.731 --> 28:59.064
And we'll pay you.

28:59.098 --> 29:01.266
I make my own money, thank you very much.

29:01.634 --> 29:04.036
I have a wife and a child.

29:04.536 --> 29:06.238
Either of you have a family?

29:08.006 --> 29:08.974
Oh, no.

29:09.541 --> 29:10.643
Don't suppose you could tell me about that,

29:10.677 --> 29:14.279
not a lot you can tell me
about, is there? Helen, James.

29:14.313 --> 29:16.949
I can tell you we'd both
put ourselves in harm's way

29:16.982 --> 29:20.219
when necessary and this is
terribly necessary, Greville.

29:20.252 --> 29:22.054
Then might I suggest you find someone

29:22.087 --> 29:23.489
who's suited for it.

29:24.056 --> 29:26.392
Sorry. I really have
done all I can for you.

29:26.425 --> 29:27.493
Greville, listen.

29:27.960 --> 29:31.263
The four-minute warning,
it won't do you any good.

29:31.296 --> 29:33.098
- What?
- The four-minute warning

29:33.132 --> 29:35.668
before a Soviet nuclear
missile hits the UK.

29:35.702 --> 29:38.270
No, I know what that...
what are you talking about?

29:38.303 --> 29:40.105
That... that's what
this has all been about?

29:40.139 --> 29:42.141
Nuclear war? Come on.

29:46.245 --> 29:47.579
See, here's the problem for you.

29:49.148 --> 29:51.450
Your house is a 12-minute
drive from your office,

29:51.483 --> 29:53.552
ten minutes if you really push, right?

29:53.986 --> 29:55.521
And you're usually out
on a sales call anyway,

29:55.554 --> 29:58.056
so you're not getting
back to Sheila in time.

29:58.490 --> 30:00.125
And Andrew's school, that's nine minutes

30:00.159 --> 30:01.661
from your house, 15 from your office,

30:01.694 --> 30:03.128
and no one's getting to him either.

30:03.162 --> 30:05.030
He'll get herded into the school basement.

30:06.165 --> 30:07.667
I looked up the building plans.

30:08.200 --> 30:11.003
That's a sorry excuse
for a fallout shelter.

30:11.036 --> 30:12.705
Same with your basement, actually.

30:12.739 --> 30:15.240
Only the government has decent shelters.

30:18.444 --> 30:19.646
What do you do?

30:21.580 --> 30:22.548
Hmm?

30:22.948 --> 30:24.983
You can spend those four minutes

30:25.017 --> 30:26.118
trying to get Sheila on the phone

30:26.151 --> 30:27.553
but you won't be able to get through.

30:30.255 --> 30:32.291
Or you can think about
how you might have helped

30:32.324 --> 30:34.059
stop this from happening...

30:35.327 --> 30:36.629
but you didn't.

30:40.032 --> 30:41.266
And then, that's it.

30:44.704 --> 30:46.038
How dare you.

30:59.585 --> 31:02.187
Truly, we'll be better
off if he doesn't do it.

31:02.789 --> 31:04.122
He'll do it.

31:06.826 --> 31:08.260
No, I got it.

31:08.828 --> 31:10.028
All right.

31:12.765 --> 31:14.533
- Hello.
- Welcome. Do come in.

31:14.566 --> 31:16.368
- Oh! Hello.
- Hello.

31:16.703 --> 31:18.638
Oh, vodka, lovely.

31:18.972 --> 31:20.506
I was just saying to
Greville we didn't drink

31:20.539 --> 31:22.140
nearly enough last night.

31:22.675 --> 31:25.778
- Thank you. Uh, do come in.
- Thank you.

31:27.246 --> 31:28.380
This is for Andrew.

31:30.282 --> 31:31.617
Very kind, thank you.

31:32.251 --> 31:33.385
This way.

31:49.368 --> 31:50.803
Dad told me about Moscow.

31:51.169 --> 31:53.372
What's it like in the rest of Russia?

31:54.641 --> 31:56.141
It is very beautiful.

31:56.608 --> 31:58.143
Especially where I come from.

31:58.544 --> 32:01.681
A lot of trees, a lot of sky.

32:02.815 --> 32:04.116
You feel...

32:05.551 --> 32:08.120
very alone but in a good way.

32:08.620 --> 32:09.822
I'd like to see that.

32:10.389 --> 32:11.658
But then of course your government

32:11.691 --> 32:13.392
isn't all that keen on foreigners

32:13.425 --> 32:15.227
just wandering around.

32:17.664 --> 32:19.832
Do the Russians really hate us that much?

32:20.165 --> 32:22.568
I think they'd like our children
to be a little more polite,

32:22.769 --> 32:23.836
Andrew.

32:24.603 --> 32:27.272
Our politicians hate your politicians.

32:27.306 --> 32:29.709
And yours hate ours, do not forget that.

32:30.375 --> 32:34.446
But the people, your father
and I, we do business.

32:34.948 --> 32:38.183
We spend time together, I meet his family.

32:39.786 --> 32:41.654
Maybe we're only two people...

32:42.588 --> 32:44.356
but this is how things change.

32:46.525 --> 32:47.492
Hmm.

32:51.163 --> 32:53.298
- What if I get caught?
- You won't.

32:53.565 --> 32:55.100
You don't know that.

32:56.736 --> 32:58.437
They'd execute me, correct?

32:58.470 --> 33:01.340
Not if they thought you're just
a courier that you took packages

33:01.373 --> 33:02.875
but didn't know what was in them.

33:02.909 --> 33:04.677
They would hold you to
trade for one of theirs.

33:04.711 --> 33:06.144
For how long?

33:06.612 --> 33:08.480
- A couple of years.
- Oh, just a couple of years

33:08.513 --> 33:10.215
rotting in some Russian Gulag.

33:10.549 --> 33:14.286
They will not catch us.
The KGB will have no idea.

33:14.887 --> 33:17.657
Listen, I'm better at this than they are.

33:17.690 --> 33:19.759
Fine. But I'm not.

33:20.392 --> 33:22.494
Look, your work...

33:22.962 --> 33:26.699
it is only deception.
Controlling your emotion.

33:27.265 --> 33:29.836
I watched you do it in
Moscow, you did it tonight.

33:29.869 --> 33:31.603
It's really not the same thing.

33:31.904 --> 33:34.373
If we're caught, they
would definitely execute me.

33:34.406 --> 33:36.241
Well, I'm very sorry
but that's your choice.

33:36.274 --> 33:38.377
That is how sure I am that you can do this.

33:38.878 --> 33:40.647
I'm betting my life on it.

33:44.249 --> 33:45.818
How can I explain this to Sheila?

33:45.852 --> 33:47.386
She cannot know the truth.

33:48.353 --> 33:49.756
For her own safety, for yours.

33:49.789 --> 33:51.490
I can't tell her any of it?

33:51.523 --> 33:52.524
No.

33:52.725 --> 33:54.393
Well, what have you told your wife?

33:56.929 --> 33:59.564
Because you know what
she'd say, "Don't do it."

33:59.598 --> 34:00.733
I'm right, aren't I?

34:02.467 --> 34:05.170
Sheila's no fool. And in the past, I've...

34:05.738 --> 34:08.540
given her reason not to trust me dully.

34:11.276 --> 34:12.611
Then you have to lie better.

34:14.446 --> 34:15.547
There are good lies.

34:16.415 --> 34:18.583
Sometimes a lie is gift...

34:19.551 --> 34:20.853
an act of love.

34:22.287 --> 34:23.823
I'm sorry it has to be you.

34:26.525 --> 34:27.694
But, Greville...

34:28.961 --> 34:30.395
it has to be you.

34:35.735 --> 34:38.270
<i>In Moscow, you must at all times</i>

34:38.303 --> 34:39.906
<i>follow the rules of the art.</i>

34:39.939 --> 34:41.606
In English, there's a word.

34:41.974 --> 34:43.710
- Tradecraft.
- Yes.

34:43.976 --> 34:45.845
You must follow tradecraft.

34:46.045 --> 34:48.547
<i>Everyone you meet,
assume they are KGB,</i>

34:48.848 --> 34:51.651
<i>waiters, hotel staff,
my driver, everyone.</i>

34:52.284 --> 34:54.586
<i>Even if they are not
actual KGB officers,</i>

34:54.987 --> 34:56.856
<i>they still make reports to KGB.</i>

34:56.889 --> 34:57.622
Ooh!

34:58.024 --> 35:00.860
<i>Every Russian is an
eye of the state.</i>

35:01.293 --> 35:04.296
<i>Every room you're in,
assume it is bugged.</i>

35:04.329 --> 35:05.698
<i>Even inside our embassy.</i>

35:05.732 --> 35:07.734
<i>Especially inside your embassy.</i>

35:08.500 --> 35:10.970
Still, our embassy
will be a good fail-safe

35:11.003 --> 35:12.270
in the event of any...

35:12.805 --> 35:13.840
complication.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.609
<i>The KGB also uses lip readers.</i>

35:17.643 --> 35:19.578
<i>You won't be able to
tell who they are.</i>

35:19.812 --> 35:20.747
<i>So never discuss...</i>

35:20.780 --> 35:23.281
<i>...anything sensitive
unless I do first.</i>

35:23.515 --> 35:24.549
How's your family?

35:25.283 --> 35:27.619
Very well, thank you. How's yours?

35:28.921 --> 35:30.890
<i>We will be seeing each other often.</i>

35:32.058 --> 35:32.925
<i>To throw off suspicion,</i>

35:33.325 --> 35:36.261
<i>I will tell my colleagues I
recruited you as a source.</i>

35:38.330 --> 35:39.832
<i>You'll keep Colonel
Penkovsky supplied</i>

35:39.866 --> 35:41.968
<i>with material on
steel manufacturing,</i>

35:42.001 --> 35:43.836
<i>industrial production and so on.</i>

35:44.503 --> 35:47.372
<i>Unclassified, but hard to come by.</i>

35:47.774 --> 35:49.541
<i>They'll believe I would do that?</i>

35:50.676 --> 35:51.677
<i>Of course.</i>

35:52.344 --> 35:54.379
<i>You are a greedy capitalist.</i>

35:54.781 --> 35:56.783
<i>You want to keep the
contracts coming.</i>

35:57.549 --> 36:00.887
<i>And from now on, every
moment you're in Moscow,</i>

36:00.920 --> 36:02.955
<i>you will be selling one thing.</i>

36:03.956 --> 36:07.425
<i>The idea that you are
an ordinary businessman</i>

36:07.459 --> 36:09.896
<i>and nothing more than
an ordinary businessman.</i>

36:09.929 --> 36:10.863
Well, gentlemen, I hope

36:11.164 --> 36:14.599
this is the first of many.
Thank you all very, very much.

36:15.034 --> 36:17.069
For good health and for business.

36:18.704 --> 36:19.839
I should get you to the airport.

36:19.872 --> 36:21.040
Yes, yes, please.

36:21.073 --> 36:22.440
<i>Do you have any questions?</i>

36:22.474 --> 36:24.043
Gentlemen, 'till next time. Thank you.

36:24.911 --> 36:26.913
<i>I want to be certain of one thing.</i>

36:28.380 --> 36:31.050
<i>I need to know that if
anything happens to me,</i>

36:31.083 --> 36:33.518
<i>my wife and son will
be provided for.</i>

36:34.754 --> 36:36.088
<i>You have my word...</i>

36:37.422 --> 36:38.958
<i>and I speak for the crown.</i>

36:54.306 --> 36:56.517
Mr. Wynne is a guest of my committee.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.185
Let him through.

37:05.685 --> 37:07.452
Thank you, Alex. Bye.

37:14.126 --> 37:15.360
Thank you.

38:13.653 --> 38:17.422
- My, where did that come from?
- I missed you.

38:17.957 --> 38:21.459
- Well, just this one time.
- Oh, every time, darling.

38:34.506 --> 38:36.208
They're really gearing up for war.

38:36.541 --> 38:39.912
This is phenomenal.
Ironbark's the real thing.

38:41.948 --> 38:43.182
Well, this just became the biggest thing

38:43.215 --> 38:45.017
going in the whole Soviet Section.

38:45.651 --> 38:48.486
Now, if I keep you on this...

38:49.722 --> 38:51.090
am I gonna regret it?

38:51.891 --> 38:52.892
No, sir.

38:55.527 --> 38:57.897
Hell!

38:58.164 --> 38:59.999
This is almost worth all the bullshit

39:00.032 --> 39:03.769
of dealing with the Brits.
How is it with those assholes?

39:04.170 --> 39:05.871
They're good guys. I just
have to make them think

39:05.905 --> 39:06.706
they're in charge.

39:07.106 --> 39:11.143
Oh, this is such an honor.
I'm... I'm learning so much.

39:14.981 --> 39:16.215
<i>Despite growing tensions</i>

39:16.248 --> 39:17.717
<i>between America and the Soviet,</i>

39:17.750 --> 39:19.251
<i>until this morning,
there was essentially</i>

39:19.285 --> 39:21.754
<i>free passage between
East and West Berlin.</i>

39:21.988 --> 39:24.023
<i>But overnight, without warning,</i>

39:24.056 --> 39:27.059
<i>the communist authorities
have barricaded off the city.</i>

39:27.293 --> 39:29.594
<i>In response, President
Kennedy has vowed</i>

39:29.628 --> 39:31.563
<i>to increase America's
military presence,</i>

39:31.596 --> 39:33.666
<i>directly speaking with General Clay</i>

39:33.699 --> 39:35.001
<i>who is stationed in Berlin.</i>

39:45.911 --> 39:48.481
Grev, would you think it's
safe to keep going to Moscow?

39:48.948 --> 39:51.516
Yes, certainly. It's fine.

39:51.851 --> 39:53.285
Even with all this?

39:54.086 --> 39:56.989
That's in Berlin, darling.
Nowhere near Moscow.

39:57.023 --> 39:58.657
Yes, I know where Berlin is

39:58.691 --> 39:59.792
and I know the Russians
and the Americans...

39:59.825 --> 40:01.626
- Please do let me...
- ...are killing any...

40:01.660 --> 40:02.628
...run my business.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.035
<i>Today in the Arctic,</i>

40:09.068 --> 40:10.936
<i>the Soviet Union had
a successful test</i>

40:10.970 --> 40:14.306
<i>of its Tsar Bomba or King of Bombs.</i>

40:14.340 --> 40:16.275
<i>With a yield of 50 megatons,</i>

40:16.308 --> 40:18.144
<i>this is by far the most powerful</i>

40:18.177 --> 40:20.079
<i>nuclear weapon ever detonated.</i>

40:22.782 --> 40:24.183
I have the figures you were asking.

40:24.483 --> 40:26.318
Thank you very much. Very helpful.

40:31.323 --> 40:33.325
<i>Today, every inhabitant</i>

40:33.558 --> 40:35.161
- <i>of this planet...</i>
- Just down there.

40:35.194 --> 40:37.763
<i>...every man, woman and child...</i>

40:37.797 --> 40:38.531
Right here, ma'am?

40:38.864 --> 40:41.333
<i>...lives under a nuclear
sword of Damocles...</i>

40:42.101 --> 40:44.703
<i>hanging by the

40:45.438 --> 40:49.008
<i>capable of being cut at
any moment by accident</i>

40:49.341 --> 40:52.278
<i>or miscalculation or by madness.</i>

40:53.012 --> 40:55.648
<i>The weapons of war must be abolished</i>

40:55.948 --> 40:57.683
<i>before they abolish us.</i>

41:02.188 --> 41:03.722
Do you have anything for me?

41:09.895 --> 41:10.896
Tomorrow.

42:22.034 --> 42:23.769
- Andrew?
- Yeah?

42:24.003 --> 42:25.271
Where are the raincoats?

42:27.406 --> 42:28.874
Oh, right.

42:30.910 --> 42:31.911
Sorry.

42:32.278 --> 42:34.280
It's fine. The forecast is a sun.

42:34.313 --> 42:36.482
No, it's not fine. What
if the forecast is wrong?

42:36.515 --> 42:37.449
What if it rains?

42:37.483 --> 42:39.885
Well, we'll want to
stay in the tent anyway.

42:40.119 --> 42:41.287
We can read books. It'll be lovely.

42:41.320 --> 42:42.421
It's not the point. The point is,

42:42.621 --> 42:43.489
I told you to pack the raincoats,

42:43.789 --> 42:46.825
I made myself perfectly
clear. So why didn't you do it?

42:46.859 --> 42:48.160
Greville, are you certain
this is how you want

42:48.194 --> 42:49.228
- to start our holiday?
- Answer me!

42:49.261 --> 42:50.196
I...

42:51.897 --> 42:52.932
I...

42:53.933 --> 42:54.600
forgot.

42:54.900 --> 42:57.403
You forgot? You know, that's fantastic.

42:57.603 --> 42:59.305
I've got a son who's too
dumb to remember something...

42:59.338 --> 43:01.373
- Greville, Greville! Greville!
- ...as simple as packing the...

43:06.011 --> 43:07.346
Your father didn't mean that.

43:11.317 --> 43:12.952
Shall we start again, hmm?

43:28.467 --> 43:29.501
Is he all right?

43:30.169 --> 43:33.272
He's asleep. It's a good sign.

43:35.274 --> 43:36.275
Here.

43:39.878 --> 43:43.382
- Will you be all right?
- Oh, fine.

43:46.352 --> 43:49.855
I really needed this
holiday and it's a good idea.

43:49.888 --> 43:50.990
Glad we came here.

43:53.459 --> 43:55.127
It's not just tonight.

43:56.528 --> 43:58.264
You've been so different lately.

44:01.400 --> 44:02.968
Greville, what's going on?

44:07.106 --> 44:10.776
Look, I didn't want to
tell you before because I...

44:12.411 --> 44:14.346
I didn't want you to be involved.

44:21.887 --> 44:23.555
It's the business. Yeah, we've...

44:24.890 --> 44:26.392
hit a bit of a rough patch.

44:29.561 --> 44:31.430
<i>That makes sense, doesn't it?</i>

44:32.097 --> 44:33.232
<i>Men and money?</i>

44:33.265 --> 44:35.200
My God, Colin went almost mad last year

44:35.234 --> 44:37.069
when his job looked the tiniest bit shaky.

44:38.103 --> 44:40.339
I wish it made sense
but it's not just that.

44:40.372 --> 44:41.173
It's everything.

44:41.507 --> 44:44.209
He's exercising all the
time and he's become so...

44:44.943 --> 44:48.847
- energetic in bed.
- That all sounds so awful.

44:48.881 --> 44:51.483
Poor you.

44:52.384 --> 44:55.220
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't joke.

44:55.988 --> 44:59.391
I know Greville had an
indiscretion once before but

44:59.425 --> 45:00.893
it doesn't mean he's having an affair now.

45:00.926 --> 45:02.594
Then why is he so secretive with me?

45:03.495 --> 45:04.596
And defensive?

45:05.597 --> 45:07.433
And it's always worse
whenever he comes home

45:07.466 --> 45:08.434
from Moscow.

45:08.735 --> 45:11.970
That's when it all started. Moscow.

45:12.639 --> 45:14.206
Oh.

45:16.075 --> 45:17.644
<i>Might be better if you
didn't have to travel</i>

45:17.677 --> 45:19.211
<i>so much...</i>

45:20.079 --> 45:21.246
better for our family.

45:21.480 --> 45:23.115
Darling, I told you, it's very important.

45:23.148 --> 45:24.249
- We need the money.
- The money?

45:24.283 --> 45:26.418
- Money, yes.
- I thought you needed the club?

45:26.452 --> 45:27.886
And you haven't caught any expenses

45:27.920 --> 45:29.455
and now we're going to a smart restaurant.

45:29.855 --> 45:32.157
Really, not quite certain, how I'm supposed

45:32.191 --> 45:32.958
to respond to that.

45:33.425 --> 45:35.894
I mean, why can't we live the
good life? It's why I work.

45:35.928 --> 45:38.063
Greville, I'm asking you
to stop going to Moscow.

45:38.097 --> 45:39.398
I'm asking you as your wife.

45:39.431 --> 45:40.232
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

45:40.566 --> 45:43.335
- There is no one else, I swear.
- I forgave you once,

45:43.369 --> 45:45.070
I never said I would again.

45:46.572 --> 45:47.873
Hello, Nina.

45:49.007 --> 45:50.309
Very nice to meet you.

45:50.744 --> 45:52.679
She's never seen a foreigner before.

46:11.130 --> 46:12.531
My wife apologizes.

46:12.931 --> 46:14.667
We cannot invite you for dinner.

46:15.033 --> 46:18.070
To bring a foreigner into
one's home, it is not done.

46:18.671 --> 46:21.273
It's all right. I'd understand.

46:30.683 --> 46:32.117
You have a lovely family.

46:32.584 --> 46:33.585
Thank you.

46:38.123 --> 46:39.124
Alex...

46:39.591 --> 46:41.293
when do you think you'll
be ready to defect?

46:41.560 --> 46:44.129
It is best if we do not talk about that.

46:44.363 --> 46:45.497
Is something the matter?

46:47.433 --> 46:48.967
Just a bit of trouble at home.

46:50.770 --> 46:52.604
One day, you will be able to tell Sheila

46:52.639 --> 46:55.007
what you have done and
she'll be very proud of you.

46:55.040 --> 46:56.442
That might be a bit too late.

46:56.942 --> 47:00.412
Sometimes Vera, she also
struggles with my work.

47:00.446 --> 47:01.748
Yes, but your wife married a soldier,

47:01.781 --> 47:03.182
mine married a salesman.

47:05.384 --> 47:07.352
You know why my government will not let you

47:07.386 --> 47:10.657
travel outside Moscow? They
want to hide the suffering.

47:14.794 --> 47:16.528
In the city life is all right,

47:16.562 --> 47:18.330
but in the country where I'm from...

47:18.798 --> 47:21.166
I do not want this life for Nina.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.535
I want her to be free from the State.

47:24.704 --> 47:28.741
Someday, if our work succeeds,
when I feel the danger is over,

47:29.141 --> 47:30.576
then I will defect.

47:31.276 --> 47:33.345
I will bring my family to Montana.

47:34.012 --> 47:36.381
- Montana?
- Yeah. I've seen some pictures,

47:36.415 --> 47:38.751
it is beautiful like where I grew up.

47:40.319 --> 47:42.387
Perhaps, I will become a cowboy.

47:42.889 --> 47:45.090
You a cowboy?

47:45.624 --> 47:48.427
- Oh, that I would like to see.
- Yes.

47:48.928 --> 47:52.030
You must come and visit,
with your family, please.

47:52.397 --> 47:53.766
I would like that very much.

47:54.634 --> 47:56.168
I would like that too.

47:57.670 --> 48:01.006
All right. I will.

48:04.844 --> 48:06.612
Sir?

48:06.646 --> 48:07.780
Thank you so much.

48:27.332 --> 48:28.433
<i>What do you have?</i>

48:29.101 --> 48:31.370
I'm seeing references to a lot of new intel

48:31.403 --> 48:33.205
coming from the Soviet Section.

48:33.605 --> 48:35.107
Can you access any of it?

48:35.140 --> 48:37.175
No. It's all way above my clearance.

48:37.509 --> 48:39.444
But I don't think it's
coming from intercepts.

48:39.812 --> 48:41.480
It feels like they might have a source.

48:46.268 --> 48:48.103
Chairman Khruschev, so far

48:48.187 --> 48:50.230
Cuba has been more trouble than it's worth.

48:50.439 --> 48:52.399
It's our one foothold in Latin America.

48:52.483 --> 48:56.028
But it's too isolated. We
can't expand from there.

48:56.195 --> 48:57.529
It's a weak spot for us.

48:59.740 --> 49:00.908
I agree.

49:00.991 --> 49:02.284
It is now.

49:04.203 --> 49:10.876
But we can turn it into a
weak spot for the Americans.

49:17.149 --> 49:19.852
<i>I... I just don't see it
for them to actually do that</i>

49:19.886 --> 49:21.788
<i>to try and sneak nukes
into our backyard,</i>

49:21.821 --> 49:24.389
- I mean, it would be...
- It'll be like an act of war.

49:24.590 --> 49:26.592
Even Khrushchev isn't that crazy.

49:27.292 --> 49:29.394
All I can tell you is that Ironbark

49:29.428 --> 49:31.163
wouldn't be in the job he or she is in

49:31.196 --> 49:32.832
if he or she were an idiot.

49:34.600 --> 49:36.468
I hope we take this seriously.

49:40.873 --> 49:42.608
Stay on this, guys.

49:44.543 --> 49:46.478
Work every Cuba source we got.

51:12.431 --> 51:14.366
- Have a good flight.
- Thank you, Alex.

52:17.196 --> 52:19.598
Colonel?

52:20.524 --> 52:22.318
Sorry, your secretary is away.

52:22.401 --> 52:24.570
Oleg Gribanov, KGB. Do
you have a few minutes?

52:24.987 --> 52:26.530
Of course, come in.

52:29.199 --> 52:31.327
It's an honour to finally meet you.

52:32.119 --> 52:37.041
I know men who served under you in Kiev.

52:37.666 --> 52:39.835
They say they owe you their lives.

52:40.711 --> 52:42.046
I thought...

52:43.130 --> 52:45.549
...you might remember these from Ankara.

52:46.675 --> 52:48.927
Contraband, I know, but...

53:20.042 --> 53:21.669
We're curious about...

53:22.211 --> 53:24.129
Greville Wynne.

53:24.838 --> 53:27.633
Have you noticed anything
unorthodox about him?

53:27.716 --> 53:30.302
Behaviour? Interactions?

53:31.971 --> 53:34.223
Nothing of concern.

53:34.974 --> 53:37.434
Or I would have noted
it in my contact reports.

53:38.268 --> 53:40.354
Yes, I read those, very thoroughly.

53:40.896 --> 53:42.690
But now that I tell you
we're looking into him...

53:44.400 --> 53:46.819
...does anything come to mind?

53:48.237 --> 53:50.155
He's been coming to Moscow for awhile.

53:50.864 --> 53:53.200
Why the concern now?

53:53.575 --> 53:56.161
Because he's been coming
to Moscow for awhile.

53:58.664 --> 54:02.710
Meets with many officials,
he goes many places.

54:02.793 --> 54:05.754
Over time, this creates questions.

54:09.633 --> 54:11.051
From what I've seen,

54:11.176 --> 54:13.512
Wynne is interested in making
money and not much else.

54:13.595 --> 54:15.806
But I will be sure...

54:16.557 --> 54:19.393
...to observe him even more closely.

54:22.813 --> 54:24.356
Thank you, Colonel.

54:24.857 --> 54:26.942
I won't take any more of your time.

54:27.484 --> 54:28.861
Thank you for warning me.

54:30.362 --> 54:31.822
I'll leave you the cigarettes...

54:36.202 --> 54:38.689
...and send you a whole carton.

54:53.185 --> 54:55.855
<i>Ironbark gave us camouflage profiles</i>

54:55.888 --> 54:57.757
for different kinds of
missile installations

54:57.790 --> 54:58.958
so we could tell 'em apart.

54:59.591 --> 55:02.028
As soon as we get some U-2 photos

55:02.061 --> 55:03.963
<i>we'll know if Cuba's
got nukes or not.</i>

55:04.163 --> 55:06.999
<i>And whether Russian missiles
can reach mainland US</i>

55:07.033 --> 55:08.067
<i>for the first time.</i>

55:08.600 --> 55:10.736
Can they get a U-2 in the air?

55:10.937 --> 55:14.006
This time of year there's
just too much cloud cover.

55:15.141 --> 55:17.910
'Til October you're all I got.

55:20.680 --> 55:21.479
Mm-hmm.

55:21.814 --> 55:24.116
When I went back to my
hotel they searched my room.

55:24.150 --> 55:25.685
But they didn't find anything?

55:26.085 --> 55:27.920
Obviously he wouldn't be here if they had.

55:27.954 --> 55:29.689
I'm saying he's still in the clear.

55:29.922 --> 55:32.825
It could just have been a
routine check which he passed.

55:33.426 --> 55:35.828
That's it Greville, we're pulling you out.

55:36.362 --> 55:38.064
But what about Penkovsky?

55:38.097 --> 55:39.932
I didn't have a chance to warn him.

55:39.966 --> 55:41.634
We'll have to find another
way to communicate with him,

55:41.667 --> 55:42.868
but you don't need to worry about that.

55:42.902 --> 55:44.236
No. You don't understand.

55:45.805 --> 55:47.572
That's why he's in danger as well.

55:47.807 --> 55:49.507
If the KGB have been looking at me,

55:49.541 --> 55:50.376
they'll be looking at him too.

55:50.810 --> 55:53.012
He's still set to come here
for the trade fair next month,

55:53.045 --> 55:53.779
- doesn't he?
- Yes.

55:54.246 --> 55:56.048
Then he's all right. If
he was under suspicion

55:56.082 --> 55:57.883
they'd never let him leave the country.

56:00.386 --> 56:03.555
But you will still help
him to defect, won't you?

56:03.756 --> 56:06.624
Whatever he likes, he's more
than earned his retirement

56:06.659 --> 56:10.062
and Greville so have you. Outstanding work.

56:11.596 --> 56:12.865
Oh, my God.

56:16.135 --> 56:17.737
So... so, that's it.

56:22.074 --> 56:23.709
Cuba. What about Cuba?

56:23.743 --> 56:25.678
Do try not to worry
about any of this anymore.

56:25.711 --> 56:27.847
Put it all out of your head, best you can.

56:29.715 --> 56:32.018
Understood.

56:37.957 --> 56:40.059
Well, thank you.

56:44.897 --> 56:49.035
What the hell are you doing?
We're shutting down Wynne, now?

56:49.068 --> 56:51.771
Please recall, Wynne is a British national.

56:52.038 --> 56:53.339
Any fallout from his capture

56:53.372 --> 56:55.041
would cause a major embarrassment

56:55.074 --> 56:55.775
for the government.

56:56.108 --> 56:58.711
We have to know what
Penkovsky knows about Cuba.

56:58.744 --> 56:59.912
Which at the moment is nothing.

57:00.112 --> 57:02.848
He'll be here next month,
we'll debrief him them.

57:02.882 --> 57:03.949
That's all.

57:40.953 --> 57:42.021
I'm, uh...

57:42.587 --> 57:45.157
I'm closing all the accounts in Moscow.

57:45.825 --> 57:47.259
So I won't be going anymore.

57:48.127 --> 57:49.128
All right.

57:52.898 --> 57:55.034
- Sure you don't want me to help?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

58:30.002 --> 58:31.036
Papa!

58:32.271 --> 58:33.272
Nina.

58:44.283 --> 58:45.951
How are you feeling?

58:46.076 --> 58:48.287
Much better.

58:48.370 --> 58:51.582
She says I've been working too hard.

58:51.665 --> 58:54.001
My body decided to give
itself a little vacation.

58:54.251 --> 58:57.046
I want to keep him here a few days

58:57.129 --> 58:58.881
to rest.

58:58.964 --> 59:00.883
Then he should be back to normal.

59:01.050 --> 59:02.343
Thank you.

59:06.430 --> 59:07.973
Nina...

59:09.058 --> 59:11.727
...can I talk with your father alone?

59:18.859 --> 59:22.905
Really, I feel fine.

59:24.073 --> 59:26.825
I couldn't wait to tell you...

59:27.868 --> 59:29.036
What?

59:31.830 --> 59:33.332
I'm pregnant.

59:44.343 --> 59:46.595
This one feels like a boy.

59:55.354 --> 59:59.191
<i>This government, as
promised, has maintained...</i>

59:59.225 --> 1:00:03.295
<i>the closest surveillance of
the Soviet military build-up</i>

1:00:03.630 --> 1:00:05.364
<i>on the island of Cuba.</i>

1:00:05.831 --> 1:00:07.366
<i>Within the past week</i>

1:00:07.866 --> 1:00:10.970
<i>unmistakable evidence

1:00:11.370 --> 1:00:14.473
<i>that a series of
offensive missiles sites</i>

1:00:14.873 --> 1:00:18.510
<i>is now in preparation on
that imprisoned island.</i>

1:00:19.144 --> 1:00:22.514
<i>The purpose of these
bases can be none other</i>

1:00:22.915 --> 1:00:25.985
<i>than to provide a
nuclear strike capability</i>

1:00:26.185 --> 1:00:27.987
<i>against the Western Hemisphere.</i>

1:00:29.188 --> 1:00:31.190
<i>It shall be the

1:00:31.523 --> 1:00:33.492

<i>Requiring a full

<i>I call upon Chairman Khrushchev</i>

<i>to halt and eliminate

1:00:52.953 --> 1:00:54.496
Excuse me, Colonel?

1:00:54.747 --> 1:00:57.666
I'm Irina from the Trade Ministry.

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:02.421
I wanted to speak to you
about the London trade fair.

1:01:02.713 --> 1:01:05.591
Yes, our preparations are going very well.

1:01:06.300 --> 1:01:09.595
The minister has decided
you do not need to attend.

1:01:11.930 --> 1:01:13.682
Oh. Are we not sending a delegation?

1:01:14.892 --> 1:01:16.101
We are...

1:01:16.185 --> 1:01:18.228
but the Minister feels
your other work is too

1:01:18.312 --> 1:01:19.730
...valuable to neglect right now.

1:01:20.064 --> 1:01:21.690
He would like you to remain in Moscow.

1:01:21.857 --> 1:01:23.275
Of course.

1:01:23.859 --> 1:01:26.278
Please tell the Minister
I won't let him down.

1:02:12.958 --> 1:02:14.159
The Soviets are standing firm,

1:02:14.193 --> 1:02:16.428
but JFK is refusing to back down.

1:02:16.962 --> 1:02:18.897
<i>It's out of our hands now.</i>

1:02:20.132 --> 1:02:21.533
<i>Anything could happen.</i>

1:02:24.103 --> 1:02:25.537
- Telegram.
- Thank you.

1:02:42.087 --> 1:02:43.188
It's time. It's got to be.

1:02:43.222 --> 1:02:45.090
- Time for what?
- Time to get him out.

1:02:45.124 --> 1:02:46.492
Greville, we can't get him out.

1:02:46.693 --> 1:02:47.893
Of course you can.

1:02:51.029 --> 1:02:52.498
Well then, what did you mean when you said

1:02:52.531 --> 1:02:54.199
you were gonna help him to defect?

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:56.502
Family holiday to East Germany,

1:02:56.535 --> 1:02:57.469
crossover in Berlin,

1:02:57.503 --> 1:02:59.505
to try and smuggle them
right out of Moscow,

1:02:59.538 --> 1:03:01.273
- I wouldn't dream of it.
- But you're MI6

1:03:01.306 --> 1:03:02.007
and CIA.

1:03:02.274 --> 1:03:03.375
I can't get anywhere near Penkovsky now,

1:03:03.409 --> 1:03:06.646
so there's no way to coordinate
with him or plan it out.

1:03:06.679 --> 1:03:08.981
We'd have to kidnap him and
his family off the street.

1:03:09.014 --> 1:03:10.249
It'd be a disaster.

1:03:10.582 --> 1:03:13.585
And if they won't let
them leave, then what?

1:03:15.521 --> 1:03:17.456
It was my idea to bring you into all this.

1:03:17.489 --> 1:03:19.525
I never should have done
that to you. I'm sorry.

1:03:24.096 --> 1:03:25.431
Well then, that's it?

1:03:29.301 --> 1:03:31.336
We're just going to abandon
him and let the KGB murder him

1:03:31.370 --> 1:03:32.504
whenever they get round to it?

1:03:32.705 --> 1:03:34.339
This is a hard truth.

1:03:34.741 --> 1:03:37.009
But if things were the other way around,

1:03:37.042 --> 1:03:39.578
- Penkovsky would abandon you.
- No. No, he would not.

1:03:39.611 --> 1:03:41.313
He's a professional. We use people.

1:03:41.346 --> 1:03:43.348
He would do just what I'm doing now.

1:03:43.582 --> 1:03:45.617
Move on. Go home.

1:03:47.319 --> 1:03:48.954
Go home to your family.

1:03:57.129 --> 1:03:58.297
You're wrong.

1:03:59.699 --> 1:04:00.700
What?

1:04:04.470 --> 1:04:06.739
You're the experts on spying
and tradecraft and all of that,

1:04:06.773 --> 1:04:09.475
but not Penkovsky. You've
met him once, I know him.

1:04:10.142 --> 1:04:12.611
He would never leave me to die.

1:04:12.946 --> 1:04:13.847
And I'm not leaving him.

1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:14.881
I'm afraid it's not your decision.

1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:18.183
You said the problem was,
there's no way to coordinate

1:04:18.217 --> 1:04:20.085
to let Penkovsky know about the escape plan

1:04:20.118 --> 1:04:21.453
but there is a way.

1:04:22.254 --> 1:04:23.255
Me.

1:04:24.223 --> 1:04:25.357
I can tell him...

1:04:26.659 --> 1:04:28.227
if I go back to Moscow.

1:04:29.161 --> 1:04:30.395
- You would do that?
- Yes.

1:04:30.429 --> 1:04:31.163
No, he wouldn't.

1:04:31.396 --> 1:04:33.198
Because he hasn't entirely lost his mind.

1:04:33.232 --> 1:04:34.533
James, be a bloody professional.

1:04:34.566 --> 1:04:36.435
I'm volunteering to
bring back the best source

1:04:36.468 --> 1:04:38.170
of Soviet intelligence you got at a time

1:04:38.203 --> 1:04:41.039
where Russia and America are
on the brink of nuclear war.

1:04:41.373 --> 1:04:44.677
You talk about using people,
for God's sake use me.

1:04:49.749 --> 1:04:51.651
If you go back to Moscow, I'll go with you.

1:04:51.684 --> 1:04:54.586
At no risk to herself. She'll
have diplomatic immunity.

1:04:54.620 --> 1:04:56.588
- She thinks you're a fool.
- I will do everything

1:04:56.622 --> 1:04:58.390
in my power to get both of you

1:04:58.423 --> 1:04:59.826
- out of there.
- But I am telling you,

1:04:59.859 --> 1:05:01.360
don't do it.

1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:22.180
Oh, I didn't know you were...

1:05:31.323 --> 1:05:35.294
I have just one last account
to close, then I'm finished.

1:05:36.361 --> 1:05:37.362
Truly.

1:05:37.730 --> 1:05:39.164
Of course. Yes.

1:05:40.566 --> 1:05:42.100
And where are you staying tonight?

1:05:45.571 --> 1:05:47.306
A hotel I think would be best.

1:06:13.900 --> 1:06:15.768
- Alex.
- Hello.

1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:11.490
Hi. I'm Karen Tucker.
I'm the new press attache.

1:07:17.596 --> 1:07:20.833
Our assets will take a boat
from Finland to Sosnovy Bor.

1:07:21.034 --> 1:07:22.669
Port security there is light.

1:07:22.902 --> 1:07:25.672
They'll pick the Penkovskys
up, ferry them back across.

1:07:25.905 --> 1:07:27.907
I need you to take the
van and divert the KGB

1:07:27.940 --> 1:07:29.541
when we leave the embassy, okay?

1:07:30.308 --> 1:07:31.878
If we can just get the Penkovskys

1:07:31.911 --> 1:07:33.545
out of Moscow clean,

1:07:33.880 --> 1:07:36.348
- we should be all right.
- Yup. Okay.

1:07:37.784 --> 1:07:39.251
You're going to do fine.

1:07:39.284 --> 1:07:40.720

missiles and sites in Cuba?</i>

1:08:32.571 --> 1:08:33.740
<i>Yes or no?</i>

1:08:40.813 --> 1:08:42.547
<i>And I'm also prepared to present</i>

1:08:42.581 --> 1:08:43.983
<i>the evidence in this room.</i>

1:08:44.016 --> 1:08:45.818
<i>Which you can all
examine at your leisure,</i>

1:08:46.018 --> 1:08:48.587
<i>shows three successive
photographic enlargements</i>

1:08:48.620 --> 1:08:50.990
<i>of another missile
base of the same type</i>

1:08:51.556 --> 1:08:53.625
<i>in the area of San Cristobal.</i>

1:08:54.994 --> 1:08:57.797
<i>These enlarged
photographs clearly show</i>

1:08:57.830 --> 1:08:59.766
<i>six of these missiles on trailers</i>

1:08:59.799 --> 1:09:01.033
<i>and three erectors.</i>

1:09:03.069 --> 1:09:05.938
<i>And that is only one example.</i>

1:12:02.014 --> 1:12:03.548
Bravo.

1:12:05.985 --> 1:12:07.086
Bravo.

1:12:07.687 --> 1:12:08.888
Bravo.

1:12:11.523 --> 1:12:12.959
Bravo.

1:12:23.435 --> 1:12:25.562
I have a light day.

1:12:25.646 --> 1:12:27.147
I'll come home after lunch.

1:12:27.273 --> 1:12:29.108
- Hmm!
- Mm-hmm.

1:12:30.442 --> 1:12:31.777
We...

1:12:32.069 --> 1:12:33.988
...can do something
fun, would you like that?

1:12:35.155 --> 1:12:36.240
Yes, Daddy.

1:12:36.907 --> 1:12:39.034
And you could wear that red dress for me?

1:12:47.193 --> 1:12:48.861
<i>Kennedy has sent the offer.</i>

1:12:49.195 --> 1:12:51.764
<i>If the Soviets take out their nukes,</i>

1:12:52.064 --> 1:12:54.200
<i>JFK will declare publicly</i>

1:12:54.532 --> 1:12:58.204
- <i>that the US will stand down.</i>
- Think they'll go for that?

1:12:58.738 --> 1:13:00.206
I really don't know.

1:13:22.328 --> 1:13:23.561
Good luck.

1:13:45.785 --> 1:13:46.952
Can I take you to the airport?

1:13:47.153 --> 1:13:49.755
Oh, that would be perfect, thank you.

1:15:32.358 --> 1:15:33.893
Excuse me, what did they say?

1:15:35.761 --> 1:15:38.931
They say, "We're sorry for the delay."

1:15:39.365 --> 1:15:40.366
Thank you.

1:15:47.773 --> 1:15:48.741
Vera!

1:15:52.853 --> 1:15:54.688
We need to leave.

1:16:11.121 --> 1:16:13.040
I have diplomatic status.

1:16:21.548 --> 1:16:23.050
Have a seat, Colonel.

1:16:34.770 --> 1:16:36.689
Oleg, what's happening?

1:16:38.065 --> 1:16:39.233
Tell her.

1:16:39.316 --> 1:16:41.151
She didn't know anything, you can see that.

1:16:41.235 --> 1:16:43.070
Tell your family why we're here.

1:16:51.203 --> 1:16:52.246
I am...

1:16:52.329 --> 1:16:53.664
I am a traitor.

1:16:54.206 --> 1:16:55.958
I betrayed the revolution.

1:17:02.297 --> 1:17:03.882
I'm so sorry.

1:17:09.388 --> 1:17:10.889
I believed in you for so long.

1:17:11.807 --> 1:17:13.434
I defended you around the Kremlin.

1:17:14.184 --> 1:17:15.561
And now this.

1:17:16.562 --> 1:17:17.646
How long have you known?

1:17:18.147 --> 1:17:19.898
Not until I had you poisoned.

1:17:21.442 --> 1:17:23.110
While you were in hospital,

1:17:23.193 --> 1:17:25.529
we did a search and
found your hiding place.

1:17:26.155 --> 1:17:27.990
Installed surveillance.

1:17:28.615 --> 1:17:30.492
We saw your plans last night,

1:17:31.410 --> 1:17:34.079
and came in this morning for a closer look.

1:17:35.289 --> 1:17:37.166
And now the game is over.

1:17:38.667 --> 1:17:40.669
I swear my family did not know.

1:17:41.003 --> 1:17:43.130
We will discuss your family later.

1:17:44.631 --> 1:17:46.050
It's time to go.

1:18:47.419 --> 1:18:48.554
Mr. Wynne...

1:18:51.857 --> 1:18:54.526
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1:18:54.761 --> 1:18:58.130
He said, come with us, Mr. Wynne.

1:18:58.163 --> 1:18:59.565
Why, what's going on? I don't understand.

1:18:59.598 --> 1:19:02.234
Mr. Wynne, please.

1:19:29.194 --> 1:19:32.030
<i>The Union of Soviet
Socialist Republic,</i>

1:19:32.398 --> 1:19:35.067
<i>has declared you persona non grata.</i>

1:19:35.434 --> 1:19:37.637
<i>You are hereby ordered
to leave the country</i>

1:19:37.670 --> 1:19:39.338
<i>within 24 hours.</i>

1:20:34.059 --> 1:20:35.194
Strip!

1:20:36.228 --> 1:20:38.030
Strip!

1:21:48.701 --> 1:21:52.504
One, two, three.

1:22:01.146 --> 1:22:02.147
Thank you.

1:22:15.193 --> 1:22:16.361
You were right.

1:22:19.431 --> 1:22:20.532
You were right, too.

1:22:28.307 --> 1:22:29.308
We had to try.

1:22:43.856 --> 1:22:46.726
Mrs. Wynne, I'm James Dobie
with the Board of Trade,

1:22:46.759 --> 1:22:49.261
- may we come in?
- Yes, please.

1:22:58.905 --> 1:23:00.907
- Oh, my God.
- It's absurd, of course.

1:23:00.940 --> 1:23:03.275
The Foreign Office is hard
at work sorting this out.

1:23:03.308 --> 1:23:06.478
- But it's a delicate situation.
- Why?

1:23:06.511 --> 1:23:09.849
Oleg Penkovsky has been arrested
as well, which is quite serious.

1:23:10.683 --> 1:23:12.451
The Russians are claiming
Greville was caught up

1:23:12.484 --> 1:23:13.552
in some sort of...

1:23:14.754 --> 1:23:16.154
well, espionage.

1:23:17.657 --> 1:23:19.458
The Foreign Office will be in touch soon.

1:23:19.491 --> 1:23:21.193
And while this is all being resolved,

1:23:21.226 --> 1:23:23.362
The Crown will provide
for you and your son.

1:23:23.395 --> 1:23:25.865
- It's true, isn't it?
- What's true?

1:23:25.898 --> 1:23:28.333
Greville was working with
Penkovsky like they say?

1:23:28.367 --> 1:23:29.102
No, no. Of course not.

1:23:29.368 --> 1:23:30.435
Can I call Greville,
I need to speak to him.

1:23:30.469 --> 1:23:32.639
- I don't think that's...
- No, I have to... I have to...

1:23:32.672 --> 1:23:34.473
I have to tell him that I'm sorry.

1:23:35.207 --> 1:23:37.744
I thought he was...

1:23:39.211 --> 1:23:41.313
My God, I've been so stupid.

1:23:41.648 --> 1:23:43.415
- Mommy?
- Andrew, go to your room.

1:23:43.650 --> 1:23:45.617
- Who are...
- Andrew, go to your room!

1:23:45.652 --> 1:23:46.686
I'm a friend of your father's.

1:23:46.719 --> 1:23:49.621
He told me you have quite
the trophy collection.

1:23:49.656 --> 1:23:50.923
Could you show me?

1:23:53.625 --> 1:23:55.260
Andrew please, it's all right.

1:24:03.803 --> 1:24:05.404
Don't tell me it's not true.

1:24:06.571 --> 1:24:07.940
I know my husband.

1:24:09.508 --> 1:24:10.777
I know he's been acting.

1:24:12.912 --> 1:24:14.546
Don't tell me it's not true.

1:24:18.017 --> 1:24:19.952
There are things I can't say to you.

1:24:31.998 --> 1:24:37.235
I can tell you that your husband
is an incredibly brave man.

1:24:38.603 --> 1:24:40.640
And he needs you now.

1:24:41.674 --> 1:24:43.710
He needs your help, Mrs. Wynne.

1:24:44.509 --> 1:24:48.580
You see, once the Russians
realize Greville is innocent,

1:24:48.881 --> 1:24:51.450
your government will be
able to get him home safe.

1:24:52.051 --> 1:24:53.251
In time.

1:24:54.687 --> 1:24:56.856
But if the Russians do decide...

1:24:57.456 --> 1:25:00.760
that Greville actually
is some kind of spy...

1:25:03.863 --> 1:25:04.997
I'm so sorry.

1:25:08.333 --> 1:25:09.969
So when you talk to anybody...

1:25:11.403 --> 1:25:13.305
that means your family...

1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:17.009
your friends, Andrew, and
especially the press...

1:25:19.746 --> 1:25:21.346
you have to tell them that none of this

1:25:21.379 --> 1:25:22.682
could possibly be true.

1:25:23.015 --> 1:25:25.283
And you have to be very convincing.

1:25:29.055 --> 1:25:30.355
Can you do that?

1:25:35.762 --> 1:25:37.496
Can you do that for Greville?

1:25:44.603 --> 1:25:47.907
I can't imagine what Penkovsky
could've confessed to.

1:25:56.849 --> 1:25:59.384
I... I'm sorry, I don't know what this is.

1:26:00.418 --> 1:26:01.687
We know everything,

1:26:01.721 --> 1:26:05.357
we know that Penkovsky gave you
packages to take to the West.

1:26:05.624 --> 1:26:08.493
- Well, yes, a few times.
- Then you admit it.

1:26:09.929 --> 1:26:13.598
Admit what? I didn't know that
I was doing anything wrong?

1:26:13.633 --> 1:26:15.668
You think stealing Soviet intelligence

1:26:15.701 --> 1:26:16.401
wasn't wrong?

1:26:16.936 --> 1:26:19.906
If that is what was
happening, I didn't know it.

1:26:20.740 --> 1:26:22.909
I never asked him what was in the packages,

1:26:22.942 --> 1:26:24.376
I didn't think it was my business.

1:26:24.409 --> 1:26:26.411
Who did you give these packages to?

1:26:26.444 --> 1:26:27.780
Well, I dropped them off

1:26:27.814 --> 1:26:29.649
in various addresses around London,

1:26:29.682 --> 1:26:31.583
I never thought anything of it.

1:26:34.687 --> 1:26:35.822
Mr. Wynne...

1:26:36.856 --> 1:26:40.592
you were asking me to believe
that you are very, very stupid.

1:26:40.893 --> 1:26:43.395
Oh, well, yes.

1:26:43.428 --> 1:26:47.432
I suppose in your world I am,
but, look, I'm just a salesman.

1:26:48.567 --> 1:26:52.805
I want my clients to like
me, so if that meant doing...

1:26:53.371 --> 1:26:55.675
a favor for Penkovsky every now and then,

1:26:55.708 --> 1:26:57.977
I really didn't see the harm.

1:29:04.203 --> 1:29:05.204
Hi.

1:29:07.139 --> 1:29:10.009
Ah! That is so sweet of you.

1:29:10.042 --> 1:29:12.510
Oh, but I wish I could
invite you in, I'm just...

1:29:12.878 --> 1:29:13.779
I'm in the middle of 20 things.

1:29:14.046 --> 1:29:17.783
Oh, no, no. That's fine. I'm
so glad to see you're well.

1:29:17.817 --> 1:29:19.885
It's been ages, we've all been worried.

1:29:19.919 --> 1:29:21.821
Yes, well, do say hello for me.

1:29:21.854 --> 1:29:25.191
Of course. I saw that ridiculous
piece in the <i>Mail.</i>

1:29:25.391 --> 1:29:26.759
It's so absurd.

1:29:27.793 --> 1:29:30.628
You don't think there could
be any truth to it, do you?

1:29:30.830 --> 1:29:32.530
What they're saying about Greville?

1:29:32.564 --> 1:29:34.000
Don't be ridiculous.

1:29:34.467 --> 1:29:36.702
How could Greville ever spy on Soviets,

1:29:36.736 --> 1:29:38.536
he couldn't even hide his affair for me.

1:29:38.738 --> 1:29:40.039
- Right.
- Thank you again for dropping by

1:29:40.072 --> 1:29:41.807
- and this was so sweet of you.
- Oh.

1:29:41.841 --> 1:29:42.942
We should have tea.

1:29:42.975 --> 1:29:44.576
- I'll be in touch. Thank you.
- Yes!

1:29:44.609 --> 1:29:48.014
Oh, all right. Bye.

1:30:07.833 --> 1:30:11.804
For years the Americans
have had the nuclear missiles

1:30:11.837 --> 1:30:13.205
in Turkey...

1:30:14.106 --> 1:30:17.009
aimed right at us.

1:30:19.011 --> 1:30:23.049
Oh, but how dare we put missiles in Cuba...

1:30:24.616 --> 1:30:25.785
is that fair?

1:30:27.119 --> 1:30:29.188
- I don't know.
- Mm.

1:30:29.822 --> 1:30:33.625
Do you realize your country
has left you here to die?

1:30:35.327 --> 1:30:37.797
No, sir, I don't believe that's true.

1:30:53.312 --> 1:30:54.313
Why?

1:30:55.681 --> 1:30:56.682
Why?

1:30:57.349 --> 1:31:02.321
Why? For God sake. What have I done?

1:31:02.521 --> 1:31:05.091
I didn't do anything.

1:31:06.292 --> 1:31:11.363
I didn't do it, you... you fucking animals!

1:32:27.306 --> 1:32:29.275
You will not touch. Sit down.

1:32:31.277 --> 1:32:32.444
Sit down.

1:32:40.219 --> 1:32:41.854
Oh, my God, darling.

1:32:43.222 --> 1:32:46.258
I know I've been ill,
but I'm on the mend now...

1:32:49.094 --> 1:32:50.362
and this will help.

1:32:52.064 --> 1:32:53.098
This will help.

1:32:53.933 --> 1:32:55.734
- Very much.
- What are they doing?

1:32:55.768 --> 1:32:57.069
What the hell are you people doing to him?

1:32:57.102 --> 1:32:58.437
It's not like that.

1:32:58.737 --> 1:33:02.241
They've been quite respectful
given the circumstance.

1:33:04.176 --> 1:33:05.411
You mustn't fault them.

1:33:06.946 --> 1:33:08.480
Really. You mustn't.

1:33:11.217 --> 1:33:12.484
What you're going through...

1:33:14.119 --> 1:33:15.387
it's all so unfair.

1:33:16.288 --> 1:33:17.957
I'm sorry for what happened.

1:33:19.825 --> 1:33:21.260
I feel wretched for doubting you.

1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:24.330
No, no. Couldn't be helped.

1:33:29.802 --> 1:33:33.138
I'm really so glad you're
here. I missed you both...

1:33:34.506 --> 1:33:35.841
very much.

1:33:36.375 --> 1:33:38.177
The foreign office said,
that's a very good sign

1:33:38.210 --> 1:33:39.845
I'm being allowed to visit you.

1:33:40.512 --> 1:33:43.315
- Hmm.
- They said it might...

1:33:43.349 --> 1:33:46.852
it might still take a
while yet to get you home

1:33:47.654 --> 1:33:49.488
since the Russians backed down in Cuba

1:33:49.521 --> 1:33:50.889
they're being very stubborn right now.

1:33:50.923 --> 1:33:52.358
What happened in Cuba?

1:33:52.391 --> 1:33:55.127
Well, they removed the missiles.
It's... It's all fine now.

1:33:55.160 --> 1:33:56.395
No more about this.

1:34:13.579 --> 1:34:15.347
And we're trying very hard.

1:34:17.549 --> 1:34:18.817
It might take another...

1:34:20.052 --> 1:34:21.320
it might take another year...

1:34:22.321 --> 1:34:23.422
or two.

1:34:31.597 --> 1:34:33.299
Tell me something about home.

1:34:33.700 --> 1:34:36.135
Tell me what I have to look forward to.

1:34:39.505 --> 1:34:41.473
Well, the garden's cooperating a bit.

1:34:41.974 --> 1:34:43.809
Finally.

1:34:44.644 --> 1:34:47.112
And we have tomatoes this year.

1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:51.050
And Andrew, he...

1:34:51.950 --> 1:34:53.319
he passed his Maths exam

1:34:53.585 --> 1:34:55.154
somehow.

1:34:57.156 --> 1:34:58.190
You'd be proud.

1:35:04.496 --> 1:35:05.898
How are you?

1:35:07.333 --> 1:35:08.334
I'm...

1:35:09.535 --> 1:35:10.569
I'm all right.

1:35:12.071 --> 1:35:13.138
Really.

1:35:15.474 --> 1:35:17.343
If you can be strong enough for this...

1:35:22.682 --> 1:35:24.116
when you come home...

1:35:26.552 --> 1:35:28.354
I hope we can start again.

1:35:36.528 --> 1:35:38.597
And I was very foolish.

1:35:40.299 --> 1:35:41.300
I'm sorry.

1:35:44.002 --> 1:35:48.073
But I just want you to know
that every moment I've been here,

1:35:48.273 --> 1:35:50.342
I have done nothing but think about

1:35:50.376 --> 1:35:52.878
how I'm going to get home to you.

1:35:57.616 --> 1:35:58.617
Really.

1:36:03.589 --> 1:36:04.590
I will.

1:36:07.459 --> 1:36:09.495
I will.

1:36:17.704 --> 1:36:19.405
<i>It's a matter of who.</i>

1:36:20.572 --> 1:36:23.008
We can't send someone of real value.

1:36:30.015 --> 1:36:31.016
Not for Wynne.

1:36:31.718 --> 1:36:33.285
Wynne wasn't valuable?

1:36:33.653 --> 1:36:35.421
We're all alive, aren't we?

1:36:35.755 --> 1:36:38.056
He's not an officer, is the point.

1:36:38.323 --> 1:36:41.360
If we propose an officer of
theirs that sends a message

1:36:41.393 --> 1:36:44.062
about how we perceive
Wynne the wrong message.

1:36:44.997 --> 1:36:48.701
If you let Wynne die over
there, and he will die,

1:36:48.902 --> 1:36:50.703
a lot sooner than you think.

1:36:51.069 --> 1:36:54.306
No one will ever trust MI6 to protect them.

1:36:54.707 --> 1:36:55.941
Ever again.

1:36:59.445 --> 1:37:00.579
You feel guilty.

1:37:02.047 --> 1:37:03.048
I know.

1:37:03.783 --> 1:37:05.517
But you were doing your job and Wynne

1:37:05.551 --> 1:37:07.519
is our countryman, Emily. I promise...

1:37:09.054 --> 1:37:10.322
we'll get him home.

1:37:19.766 --> 1:37:22.434
If you think Penkovsky will protect you...

1:37:23.101 --> 1:37:25.437
you think too highly of him.

1:37:27.372 --> 1:37:29.141
He betrayed his country...

1:37:31.043 --> 1:37:32.077
his family...

1:37:33.512 --> 1:37:34.647
why not you?

1:37:39.485 --> 1:37:42.488
It is every man for himself. Yes?

1:38:00.272 --> 1:38:01.273
Hi.

1:38:04.376 --> 1:38:07.145
I have not seen a mirror for a long time.

1:38:10.717 --> 1:38:13.185
I like to think I'm still quite worth...

1:38:14.854 --> 1:38:16.388
for the time.

1:38:18.490 --> 1:38:21.093
I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again.

1:38:23.128 --> 1:38:25.163
I'm so sorry you're here Greville.

1:38:28.133 --> 1:38:31.537
I hope you can forgive me for this...

1:38:34.139 --> 1:38:35.675
and for what I had to do.

1:38:37.543 --> 1:38:39.812
What you mean, what you had to do?

1:38:45.517 --> 1:38:46.686
I held back...

1:38:49.187 --> 1:38:50.723
<i>for as long as I could.</i>

1:38:52.157 --> 1:38:54.426
<i>I have to protect
my family, Greville.</i>

1:38:56.161 --> 1:38:59.431
To save them, I had to
tell the KGB the truth.

1:39:01.300 --> 1:39:02.702
All of the truth.

1:39:08.206 --> 1:39:09.308
I told them...

1:39:11.310 --> 1:39:13.312
I gave you pictures that...

1:39:13.913 --> 1:39:17.082
helped Americans find missiles in Cuba.

1:39:28.226 --> 1:39:29.729
And of course I told them...

1:39:31.330 --> 1:39:33.766
you didn't know what was
in the packages I gave you.

1:39:52.852 --> 1:39:53.786
Greville...

1:39:57.322 --> 1:40:00.793
I thought I could make
the world a safer place...

1:40:04.529 --> 1:40:05.632
but I failed.

1:40:07.299 --> 1:40:08.300
All this...

1:40:11.236 --> 1:40:12.672
betraying my country,

1:40:13.305 --> 1:40:16.743
my people, all for nothing.

1:40:19.544 --> 1:40:20.647
Alex...

1:40:28.253 --> 1:40:29.922
of course I forgive you.

1:40:32.290 --> 1:40:34.761
I have to look after my family, too.

1:40:36.495 --> 1:40:38.563
Easier now I know there's not gonna be

1:40:38.597 --> 1:40:39.932
a nuclear war...

1:40:41.366 --> 1:40:43.636
because Khrushchev withdrew his missiles...

1:40:43.836 --> 1:40:46.673
...because of you.

1:40:47.073 --> 1:40:48.407
Because of you.

1:40:49.474 --> 1:40:50.475
You.

1:40:51.044 --> 1:40:54.279
You did it, Alex. You did it.

1:40:54.781 --> 1:40:56.816
You. You did it.

1:40:57.784 --> 1:40:59.819
Because of you, Alex.

1:41:00.585 --> 1:41:01.688
<i>You did it.</i>

1:42:38.818 --> 1:42:40.653
<i>Maybe we're only two people...</i>

1:42:45.758 --> 1:42:47.392
but this is how things change.

1:42:59.404 --> 1:43:01.974
Daddy, where are you?

1:44:11.043 --> 1:44:12.712
<i>Mr. Wynne, you've just
spoken to your wife,</i>

1:44:12.745 --> 1:44:14.013
<i>what were your first words to her</i>

1:44:14.046 --> 1:44:15.580
and what were her first words to you?

1:44:15.614 --> 1:44:17.650
Frankly, we're both rather speechless.

1:44:17.683 --> 1:44:18.985
There were no words for a moment.

1:44:19.218 --> 1:44:21.120
Do you have any idea of
what you're going to do

1:44:21.153 --> 1:44:22.587
in the future?

1:44:22.889 --> 1:44:26.659
Oh, I want to get back to
my normal business activities

1:44:26.692 --> 1:44:28.761
as soon as I possibly can.

1:44:28.794 --> 1:44:30.428
Well, is that to the same company?

1:44:31.964 --> 1:44:33.565
With my own company.

1:44:33.598 --> 1:44:35.433
Will you travel in East Europe again?

1:44:35.635 --> 1:44:37.069
Oh, now, that is quite a question

1:44:37.103 --> 1:44:39.537
which I can't answer today.
