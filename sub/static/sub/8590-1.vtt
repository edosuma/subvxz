WEBVTT

00:00.792 --> 00:03.419
(Narrator speaks...)

01:16.493 --> 01:18.952
(Dogs barking)

01:20.914 --> 01:22.581
(Opens locks)

01:34.636 --> 01:36.136
(Vehicle approaching)

01:37.597 --> 01:38.889
(Man) There he is.

01:39.015 --> 01:41.350
- It's the man, right there.
- Let's go!

02:12.674 --> 02:15.175
Have a little discussion with you,
my man?

02:26.062 --> 02:27.896
Where you going, pencil neck?

02:39.409 --> 02:40.993
You...

02:47.625 --> 02:50.252
Yeah, it's me.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.796
This thing must be stopped!

02:58.887 --> 03:00.679
Let me have it.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.681
Right here, boss.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.018
(Sniffs)

03:15.195 --> 03:17.321
It's not too late.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.949
You can still come back.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.260
Let me have him.

03:46.809 --> 03:52.189
You fool, Segawa.
You think you could get away with it?

03:52.315 --> 03:55.108
These inhuman experiments
must stop.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.163
Oh, no!

04:33.273 --> 04:34.982
- Teriyaki sauce!
- Yeah.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.155
Turn him into sushi!

04:43.449 --> 04:46.451
Your can is packed, tuna man!

04:50.456 --> 04:51.331
Whoa!

04:58.172 --> 05:00.507
What a waste of a good brain.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.804
(Laughter)

05:06.931 --> 05:08.223
(Roars)

05:12.895 --> 05:14.813
(Man) Let's go!

07:15.935 --> 07:18.103
That's three. Want to try for four?

07:18.229 --> 07:19.980
lt was a lucky move.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.078
- Hello.
- Hi.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.414
So... you need a ride home tonight?

07:39.500 --> 07:42.085
OK. lt's better than the bus.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.588
(Clapping)

07:52.180 --> 07:56.975
OK. Today l'm gonna demonstrate
a technique that's called irimi'.

07:57.101 --> 08:01.605
This is an Aikido technique,
and it means "entering throw".

08:01.731 --> 08:07.360
So for example if your opponent comes
at you with a kick and a punch,

08:07.487 --> 08:09.571
just use your chi power.

08:09.697 --> 08:13.575
"Chi" means the central energy
of people and of the universe.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.536
Your chi must be in tune
with the chi of the universe.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.538
May l help you?

08:18.664 --> 08:21.208
l'm looking for Mizky Segawa.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.335
That's me.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.130
Dr Tetsu Segawa's daughter?

08:28.132 --> 08:30.300
ls something wrong?

08:30.426 --> 08:33.553
l think we should talk... privately.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.140
Sure.

08:37.933 --> 08:41.352
(Teacher) ...neutralise his attack
by entering diagonally,

08:41.479 --> 08:44.898
take his centre and
redirect his power back at him.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.359
l'm Max Reed, ClA.

08:48.277 --> 08:51.863
Been investigating the Chronos
Corporation where your father worked.

08:53.324 --> 08:56.785
- l've got some bad news for you.
- What?

08:56.911 --> 08:59.704
'Your father and l had
a meeting tonight.

08:59.830 --> 09:03.250
'He was delivering something
he'd gotten out of Chronos' lab.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.921
'He said it was important...
and dangerous.

09:10.007 --> 09:13.677
'He never made it.
They got to him first.

09:15.137 --> 09:18.557
'l couldn't quite make out
what was going on.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.058
'lt was violent.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.478
'Weird.'

09:23.604 --> 09:25.522
(Man) Teriyaki sauce!

09:28.401 --> 09:29.985
Let's go!

09:56.512 --> 09:59.014
(Reed) 'We couldn't get to him in time.'

10:03.603 --> 10:05.895
Why the hell didn't you wait?

10:10.776 --> 10:12.027
Jesus.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.448
l'm sorry. Your father's dead.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.661
(Teacher) OK, Ben, attack me.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.964
Sean, how about stepping forward
and showing the class

10:33.090 --> 10:35.425
your version of the move
l just demonstrated.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.971
Come on, let's go.
Greg, you attack Sean.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.643
Sean, you defend yourself
and use the irimi throw.

10:52.568 --> 10:53.818
Hajime!

10:58.407 --> 11:00.950
Rule number one: pay attention.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.329
OK, everybody, let's try it.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.414
You two, try it again.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.885
Sean!

11:27.687 --> 11:31.272
- Hey, butthead, l wasn't ready.
- You should've been.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.947
Hey, hey! You guys,
break it up.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.199
Break it up.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.535
Hey, hey! Hold it!

11:43.661 --> 11:46.287
You two want to get personal?
Take it outside.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.709
- Get a wet towel for that.
- Yeah, OK.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.127
l'm sorry.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.146
Sean, you have to learn
to control your temper,

12:11.272 --> 12:15.734
or nothing l'm teaching you here
is ever going to help you out there.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.944
Now cool out for a while.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.727
(Footsteps)

13:02.865 --> 13:04.324
Ah...

13:07.536 --> 13:09.788
You have it?

13:17.421 --> 13:20.131
Good, because...

13:23.052 --> 13:25.094
l wouldn't want...

13:26.555 --> 13:29.390
...a hair on your...

13:31.018 --> 13:32.727
...lovely head...

13:33.562 --> 13:34.813
...hurt.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.489
l recovered the Guyver myself.

13:45.699 --> 13:47.367
Of course you did.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.966
What is this?

14:04.134 --> 14:09.514
Some sort of masochistic joke?

14:11.267 --> 14:13.351
How did that get in there?

14:16.146 --> 14:17.605
(Groans)

14:25.197 --> 14:26.656
(Roars)

14:49.096 --> 14:50.555
(Screaming)

14:50.681 --> 14:53.725
I'll get it back. I'll get it back.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.662
You idiot!

15:15.873 --> 15:20.668
I'II have you sIap yourseIf
into obIivion if you don't find it.

15:21.670 --> 15:25.089
It is the onIy one in existence.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.218
- You must find it.
- I'II find it.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.553
I'II get it.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.351
(Police radio indistinct)

16:22.064 --> 16:24.691
(Reporter) The decomposed body
of Dr Tetsu Segawa,

16:24.817 --> 16:27.360
a genetic scientist
for the Chronos Corporation,

16:27.486 --> 16:31.364
was found earlier tonight here
below the 7th Street Bridge.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.992
We contacted Chronos Corporation
representatives,

16:34.118 --> 16:37.412
but they would not comment
on why no reports were made...

16:39.623 --> 16:42.875
He never harmed anybody
in his whole life.

16:49.133 --> 16:52.135
My mother died when l was little,

16:52.261 --> 16:54.929
and as a kid,
l worshipped my father.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.975
Who would do this to him?

17:00.436 --> 17:02.520
l intend to find out.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.277
Who the hell did you bring
in here this time, Reed?

17:18.662 --> 17:20.621
So you're still chasing
Ninja Turtles, huh?

17:20.748 --> 17:23.624
Hey, l'm telling you, l saw them.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.127
And l'm telling you,
you're going after the wrong people.

17:26.252 --> 17:28.296
You're telling me
they got friends in high places.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.339
l'm telling you
you got a bad attitude.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.300
And this is no longer
department business.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.595
Hey. l'm on my own time,
all right?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.598
OK, Max.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.851
You want to chase monsters?
Go right ahead.

17:43.562 --> 17:47.732
Only thing l can offer you
is enough rope to hang yourself.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.221
What's this?

18:29.024 --> 18:30.525
Wow.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.946
(Reed) Man...

18:35.948 --> 18:38.866
You know, something terrible
must have gone wrong for him

18:38.992 --> 18:41.828
to end up in a place like this.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.039
lt took a lot of courage
for him to contact me.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.291
l'm not gonna let him down.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.210
Come on, I'll take you home.

19:16.822 --> 19:20.616
You may be getting a visit
from the police tomorrow.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.493
They'll be asking a lot of questions.

19:22.619 --> 19:25.705
l'm just sorry l don't have
more information for you.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.043
You've been very kind.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.004
Yeah, well...

19:33.130 --> 19:37.300
l'm not sure l like leaving you here.
lt could be dangerous.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.971
Just what was my father
mixed up in?

19:42.681 --> 19:46.142
You know, l'm not exactly sure.
lt was very strange.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.729
He was trying to bring me a mechanical
device that Chronos had found.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.315
Something he called "The Guyver"?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.611
"The Guyver"? What's that?

19:56.737 --> 20:01.407
Apparently, it was some
sort of space armour, l think.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.285
l mean, l don't know,
but your father described it

20:04.411 --> 20:06.996
as the most dangerous technology
since the atom bomb.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.752
He was a research scientist.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.463
How could he get involved
in something like that?

20:16.381 --> 20:18.549
l don't think the inventors
of the atom bomb

20:18.675 --> 20:21.344
knew what they were getting into either.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.764
l do know that when your father knew
what was at stake,

20:24.890 --> 20:27.725
he tried to get back into the lab,
steal it, and bring it to me.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.185
(Knock on door)

20:29.937 --> 20:32.396
Let me. You never know.

20:32.522 --> 20:35.733
lt's OK. lt's my place.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.986
OK, go ahead, but be careful.

20:48.872 --> 20:51.707
Oh, l forgot.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.503
Are you all right?

20:55.629 --> 20:57.338
(Sniffs) Yes.

20:57.464 --> 21:00.883
Sean, l'm sorry,
l forgot about the ride.

21:07.099 --> 21:11.644
Uh... Look, l'm sorry,
l didn't realise that you had company.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.646
No, it's not that.

21:13.772 --> 21:17.108
No, no, it's OK.
l didn't mean to disturb you.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.860
l just wanted to make sure
that you were OK.

21:20.737 --> 21:21.988
l gotta go.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.619
lt's a lousy place for a mirror.

21:55.022 --> 21:58.566
Yo, checkout time.
Come on, my man, checkout time.

21:58.692 --> 21:59.900
Get outta here.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.737
- l thought checkout time was 1 1 :00.
- Hey!

22:02.863 --> 22:05.865
Hey!

22:11.163 --> 22:14.206
Yo, you've got to learn how to recycle.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.751
Yeah? Recycle this.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.589
♪	 Yo, mama,
why you wanna be so crude?

22:21.715 --> 22:24.633
♪	 You must think of me
as one rude dude

22:24.760 --> 22:27.553

22:27.679 --> 22:32.600

22:32.726 --> 22:35.853
Striker, get back to work.

22:35.979 --> 22:40.024
But we don't even know
what that Guyver thing looks like.

22:40.150 --> 22:45.571
You don't need to know.
Just bring me whatever you find!

23:03.423 --> 23:04.882
(Engine fires)

23:05.008 --> 23:06.467
Shit.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.846
(lgnition fails)

23:11.890 --> 23:13.224
Aw, great.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.788
What's wrong, man?
The bike don't wanna start?

23:35.914 --> 23:38.582
(Chuckles) Hey, man, watch out,
I'll help you with that.

23:38.708 --> 23:41.335
Come on, man,
get away from my bike!

23:41.461 --> 23:42.962
Whoa!

23:43.088 --> 23:46.841
Cool, chili man, l'm just trying
to help you out. Come on, man.

23:46.967 --> 23:50.094
l'm telling you, get away from it,
or l'm gonna have to really hurt you.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.555
Ooh...

23:53.932 --> 23:56.058
lt's Kung Fu Man.

23:57.477 --> 23:59.854
Hey! Hey, guys, look.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.231
lt's Kung Fu Man.

24:13.201 --> 24:15.661
Ain't no mats out here, homeboy.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.622
You know this fool?

24:18.748 --> 24:21.459
Yeah, we threw down before.

24:22.836 --> 24:25.087
Look, l don't want to hurt anybody, OK?

24:25.797 --> 24:29.467
- No, no. He's just trying to fix his bike.
- That's what l was telling him, man.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.596
Well, l could do that.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.100
Oops.

24:38.226 --> 24:40.644
lt didn't start.
lt must be busted or something.

24:44.065 --> 24:47.610
What do you think?
Hey, what do you think?

24:47.736 --> 24:49.028
Get him!

24:55.535 --> 24:57.536
Now, you got something to show, man?
Come on.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.914
You got something, man?
Come on.

25:00.040 --> 25:04.084
- Show us what you got.
- Whoa!

25:07.130 --> 25:09.757
Wait. Wait a minute.
He doesn't scare me.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.967
l've seen him fight, then.

25:19.392 --> 25:20.976
Hit him!

25:26.983 --> 25:28.901
Yeah!

25:32.906 --> 25:35.282
Come on, man! Come on!

25:38.411 --> 25:40.079
Where are you going?

25:41.998 --> 25:43.499
Hold up, man! Hold up, hold up!

25:56.471 --> 25:58.973
That's what you get, man,
for messing with us.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.100
Come on, man,
what's up with you?

26:07.566 --> 26:09.358
Hey, you got the money?

26:10.694 --> 26:12.778
Check it, l don't even see nothing
in there, man.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.155
- Watch out, he's gonna get away.
- Stay down.

26:28.378 --> 26:29.753
Hey.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.257
Don't touch him, man.
Don't touch him.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.344
He's sick or something.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.768
What the hell is that, man?

26:47.022 --> 26:49.189
That ain't right, man.
That ain't right.

26:58.867 --> 27:02.119
Oh, no. Oh!

27:16.593 --> 27:18.552
Wait, wait, wait.
Wow, hold on, man.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.804
Wait, watch out.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.681
He's gonna get him.

27:22.807 --> 27:25.893
Kick his ass, man. Get in there.
Kick his ass. Get him.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.394
- Get him.
- Go ahead, you.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.687
- Come on, man.
- Come on.

27:28.813 --> 27:29.938
You're dead, dude.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.245
Got him.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.665
Got him, man. Help!

27:49.959 --> 27:51.919
l don't got him, man.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.936
Get him, man. Get him.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.562
Watch out!

28:21.324 --> 28:23.325
Watch out, man,
l got something to cut you.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.285
- Come on.
- Cut you.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.419
Oh.

28:34.921 --> 28:37.339
You asking for it now!

28:40.135 --> 28:42.052
Oh, no.

28:45.098 --> 28:49.184
l'm just playing you, man.
Yeah, that's it, l'm just playing.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.187
(Guyver) Then let's play.

28:55.608 --> 28:58.110
OK, Mr Robocop,
you're going down.

29:03.616 --> 29:05.451
Ain't got no bullets.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.124
l'm outta here, man.

29:15.712 --> 29:18.630
(Guyver) No, you're going down.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.391
Hey, man. Just be cool!

29:29.517 --> 29:31.018
Come on!

29:31.895 --> 29:33.395
- (Guyver) What the...?
- Be cool.

29:33.521 --> 29:35.773
You guys come in peace, right?

29:35.899 --> 29:39.526
- (Guyver) Oh, my God.
- We're friendly people, man.

29:39.652 --> 29:41.779
What happened to me?

29:49.329 --> 29:51.997
l can't get it off.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.753
No!

30:16.314 --> 30:19.817
Yo, boss,
we're getting nothing, man.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.903
lt ain't here.
You know what l'm saying?

30:23.029 --> 30:24.780
Junk.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.907
Nothing but junk.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.382
He must've pulled a switch.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.177
Brilliant.

30:52.058 --> 30:55.018
Do you realise what's at stake?

30:57.605 --> 31:02.401
The most lethal weapon
ever conceived.

31:02.527 --> 31:08.031
A one-of-a-kind prototype
lost for centuries,

31:08.157 --> 31:13.412
and all you have for me is,
"He pulled a switch."

31:14.205 --> 31:17.249
His daughter was
at the river channel.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.127
- His daughter?
- Last night.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.588
- Daughter?
- With two men. They might be...

31:22.714 --> 31:24.840
Bring her to me!

31:24.966 --> 31:27.175
And anyone else connected.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.428
Perhaps she knows something.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.972
lt's obvious you don't.

31:32.098 --> 31:34.016
Go, get her.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.767
Yes, sir!

31:44.611 --> 31:45.861
Damn!

32:05.757 --> 32:07.633
Oh, shit. Wow.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.954
Come on, you didn't push hard enough.
We didn't even get near the head guy.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.749
They're not a weapons manufacturer.
Segawa is a pinhead scientist.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.751
- What is there to push?
- He discovered something.

32:42.877 --> 32:45.170
He was trying to bring it to me
when they got to him.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.422
They said he didn't steal anything
and nothing's missing.

32:47.548 --> 32:49.967
We need more than a midnight shadow
to bother those kind of people.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.718
Hey, we got a murder here!

32:51.844 --> 32:55.305
Max, we got a corpse
that looks like it's a month old.

32:55.431 --> 32:57.182
At least the pieces that are left.

32:57.308 --> 32:59.935
l tell you one thing
that l know for sure...

33:00.061 --> 33:02.396
Chronos was not involved.

33:02.522 --> 33:06.274
Nice and neat, huh?
No fuss, no muss.

33:07.527 --> 33:10.737
Look,
l think it's better that way.

33:10.863 --> 33:12.739
For all of us.

33:14.617 --> 33:16.827
Just one thing...

33:16.953 --> 33:19.621
l mean, what the hell is a scientist
doing in the middle of the night

33:19.747 --> 33:22.916
walking down a concrete riverbed
in his lab coat? Fishing?

33:23.042 --> 33:27.045
Who knows? Some people will do
anything to land a fish.

33:27.171 --> 33:29.131
Even tell a fish story.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.883
Yeah, well it ain't fish l smell,
it's a rat.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.429
Just cool it, Reed.

33:36.264 --> 33:38.015
lt's out of our hands.

33:38.141 --> 33:41.435
For all we know,
it could be some sick random killing

33:41.561 --> 33:43.562
from last month's caseloads.

33:44.272 --> 33:48.483
l mean, what are they looking for?
Where else are they gonna look?

33:49.610 --> 33:52.529
Damn. You're right.

33:52.655 --> 33:54.573
You just convinced me.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.827
Where the hell are you going?

33:58.953 --> 34:01.455
To get enough rope to hang myself.

34:04.751 --> 34:07.753
l want him followed around the clock.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.850
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.561
Come in.

34:32.987 --> 34:37.699
Sean... l have something
to tell you about last night.

34:37.824 --> 34:40.409
All right, look... no, that was my fault.
Last night, l mean.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.704
l just thought maybe...

34:44.498 --> 34:46.416
Mizky, is something wrong?

34:49.378 --> 34:51.670
My father was killed last night.

34:54.926 --> 34:58.386
Oh, my God. l... l'm sorry.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.848
l had no idea.

35:01.974 --> 35:03.767
l know.

35:04.685 --> 35:06.394
lt's just that...

35:08.314 --> 35:10.273
l don't know...

35:12.568 --> 35:16.655
l feel numb, or... l could scream.

35:23.287 --> 35:25.413
l feel so alone.

35:33.339 --> 35:35.715
l'm glad you're here.

35:41.722 --> 35:43.974
(Knocking at door)

35:44.100 --> 35:46.726
Ms Jensen. l forgot.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.813
(Sean) Perfect timing.

35:53.151 --> 35:57.070
- Hi. Can l help?
- Oh, no, l got it.

35:57.196 --> 35:59.072
l'd just like to put it down.

35:59.198 --> 36:01.449
- Yeah, of course, come in.
- Thanks.

36:05.413 --> 36:06.746
Hi, Sean.

36:06.873 --> 36:09.749
l didn't realise l was interrupting
anything, barging in like this.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.919
Oh, no, no.
Actually...

36:14.505 --> 36:16.840
- l was just leaving.
- I'll just be a minute. Stay.

36:16.966 --> 36:19.593
No, really. l'm out the door.

36:25.725 --> 36:29.811
Well, you don't really need to go.
She'll just be a minute.

36:29.937 --> 36:33.732
Er... OK, what if l go
get something to eat

36:33.858 --> 36:38.111
and bring it back,
and we could just talk?

36:40.823 --> 36:42.073
OK.

36:49.540 --> 36:50.999
Hi.

36:51.125 --> 36:52.876
Excuse me.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.760
You know...

37:01.886 --> 37:04.554
- This Guyver is...
- Shh!

37:05.389 --> 37:09.267
This is the first quiet moment
we've had together.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.481
You know, you're right?

37:15.983 --> 37:18.360
There should be more
quiet moments together.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.153
Yeah.

37:20.279 --> 37:21.821
ln Brazil.

37:23.324 --> 37:26.451
Really? Really?

37:26.577 --> 37:29.788
- Why not?
- And then will you take me shopping?

37:30.665 --> 37:32.958
- Sure, I'll take you shopping.
- Oh!

37:34.961 --> 37:37.712
- She wasn't this heavy before.
- My face is killing me.

37:37.838 --> 37:40.465
- Keep moving there.
- Jesus.

38:03.990 --> 38:05.573
Mizky!

38:09.704 --> 38:11.079
Oh, my God.

38:13.666 --> 38:15.250
Mizky?

38:17.420 --> 38:19.337
Well, now that l've captured
the young lady,

38:19.463 --> 38:22.632
why don't you do me a favour and
run up to the apartment and get my hat?

38:22.758 --> 38:26.052
You captured lady? lf wasn't for me,
you'd be on the floor, still going, "Aaah."

38:26.178 --> 38:27.512
You get your own hat.

38:27.638 --> 38:30.849
l'm not a male chauvinist.
l didn't want to knock the girl out again.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.143
You couldn't knock her out?
l had to kill the other one myself.

38:33.269 --> 38:36.479
- l'm not going to go get your hat.
- Look, l need the hat.

38:36.605 --> 38:38.857
Man, it's like Kryptonite,
l cannot function...

38:38.983 --> 38:41.276
Well, if you're Superman,
go and fly and get hat.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.486
(Car screeches to halt)

38:45.990 --> 38:47.949
Cut the chatter. Come on.

38:50.286 --> 38:51.494
This could be trouble.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.121
- What?
- Could be trouble.

38:53.247 --> 38:56.082
Forget your trouble, man.
There's no trouble.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.752
Just be quiet,
don't say nothing, man. Be quiet.

38:58.878 --> 38:59.919
Gentlemen.

39:06.719 --> 39:09.971
- Hey, what the hell's going on?
- They got Mizky.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.561
- They killed Ms Jensen!
- All right, get going. Go on!

39:20.608 --> 39:22.442
Get them up. Come on.

39:22.568 --> 39:25.528
- No transformations! We can't be seen.
- Snap out of it.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.830
- Let's go.
- Come on.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.833
Come on.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.710
l'm coming.

39:53.307 --> 39:55.058
Come on.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.728
Get over the wall.

39:59.438 --> 40:02.023
(Man) 17... quiet!

40:10.908 --> 40:12.575
Ah, screw it.

40:20.292 --> 40:21.668
l got him!

40:22.753 --> 40:24.087
Striker!

40:24.880 --> 40:26.840
Geronimo!

40:28.843 --> 40:30.468
(Screams)

40:30.594 --> 40:32.679
Chill, mama, shh!

40:32.805 --> 40:35.098
Cut that! Be quiet! My bo...

40:36.183 --> 40:38.893
The boss is right there. Shh!

40:39.019 --> 40:40.645
Hey, chill, cool!

40:40.771 --> 40:43.481
Bruisin', killin', cruisin'! Shh!

40:45.109 --> 40:47.026
- Hey, yo...
- (Man) Cut!

40:47.153 --> 40:49.904
Yo, where the hell am l?

40:50.030 --> 40:53.992
Hey, that is not your cue!

40:54.118 --> 40:57.203
You stepped on my scream.

40:57.329 --> 40:59.664
- Huh?
- No! No, no, no, no.

40:59.790 --> 41:03.418
You're not afraid of her,
she is afraid of you.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.338
Come on.

41:07.798 --> 41:10.633
Look, you were great.
You were wonderful, darling, really.

41:10.759 --> 41:13.470
- No. Make-up, over here.
- ldiot.

41:15.097 --> 41:16.973
Look, look, look, look, look, look.

41:17.683 --> 41:19.851
- You're the big boogedy monster.
- Boogedy monster.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.270
All we want you to do
is to jump over the wall,

41:22.396 --> 41:24.856
land down here, go,
"l'm gonna get you, l'm gonna get you."

41:24.982 --> 41:27.901
She can scream, she gets scared a lot.
And that's it. lt's that simple.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.694
- You missed a spot.
- Get off me.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.571
Come on. The suit looks great.

41:31.697 --> 41:34.282
You look terrific,
but l need you to be more...

41:34.408 --> 41:38.453
More terrifying. You're a monster.
l need you to play this with... with...

41:38.579 --> 41:41.372
- What? What?
- With truth.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.459
Can you do that?

41:44.585 --> 41:45.960
- Right on.
- Yeah. We gotta go.

41:46.086 --> 41:48.546
All right, back to one. We gotta
get to the car chase before lunch.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.673
Come on. You can do it.
All right, everybody. Come on.

41:50.799 --> 41:55.178
We're sitting on a powder keg.
We have got to go, right now.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.728
Damn.

42:03.854 --> 42:05.522
We can't go back.

42:06.482 --> 42:08.733
Come on. Come on.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.954
We got to find
another way out of here.

42:26.001 --> 42:27.585
Damn!

42:27.711 --> 42:29.546
Why are they chasing us?

42:29.672 --> 42:31.339
They want the Guyver.

42:31.465 --> 42:34.008
- The what?
- The Guyver.

42:34.134 --> 42:37.303
They killed my father
and then Ms Jensen for it.

42:37.429 --> 42:40.181
And they think that l have it.
But l...

42:40.307 --> 42:42.267
l think he was trying to give it to me
at the river channel.

42:42.851 --> 42:45.103
No screw-ups this time.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.856
Once we're inside,

42:48.983 --> 42:51.442
we can all have some fun.

42:53.153 --> 42:56.406
But l want that girl... unharmed.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.301
What is a Guyver?

43:16.427 --> 43:20.346
From what he told me, it's some sort
of defence shield or space armour.

43:20.472 --> 43:23.975
Something that could be dangerous
if Chronos figured out how to activate it.

43:25.477 --> 43:28.104
ls that monster chasing us
a Guyver?

43:28.230 --> 43:31.566
l don't know what the hell that is,
and l'm not sure l want to find out.

43:31.692 --> 43:33.526
(Clattering)

43:33.652 --> 43:35.778
Oh, my God, they're coming!

43:35.904 --> 43:38.740
Come on, get outta sight. Move it!

43:45.414 --> 43:46.873
(Banging)

43:59.970 --> 44:02.764
- Striker! Ramsey!
- Yes, boss.

44:03.599 --> 44:05.725
Find the girl.

44:05.851 --> 44:08.811
- You, search downstairs.
- You got it.

44:16.987 --> 44:19.155
Come on, let's go shopping.

44:19.323 --> 44:21.240

47:12.246 --> 47:13.830
Ooh!

47:41.775 --> 47:43.568
Sean!

47:43.694 --> 47:45.820
- Gotcha!
- No!

47:45.946 --> 47:47.613
Mizky!

47:59.668 --> 48:01.377
You're mine, sucker!

48:04.047 --> 48:05.131
Uh-oh!

48:12.264 --> 48:13.389
Striker.

48:13.557 --> 48:15.349
Striker!

48:15.475 --> 48:16.475
Are you all right?

48:16.602 --> 48:19.020
No problem, bro.
l'm fine. Whoa...

48:19.146 --> 48:21.981
Oh, Striker, come on, it's OK.

48:22.107 --> 48:25.151
Bring her down here.

48:39.082 --> 48:40.750
Go, go.

48:43.045 --> 48:45.129
Let's hope we're not too late.

48:54.264 --> 48:56.766
- Which way did they go?
- That way. Come on.

48:57.517 --> 49:00.144
Oh good.
Look, the whole team's here now.

49:00.270 --> 49:01.354
Sorry we're late.

49:06.193 --> 49:08.402
- Sean!
- Shut up!

49:10.364 --> 49:11.739
Let her go!

49:14.159 --> 49:16.535
(Laughter)

49:18.455 --> 49:19.997
Shut up!

49:20.832 --> 49:23.459
- ls that a request?
- l know what you want.

49:25.295 --> 49:26.796
Shut up.

49:28.590 --> 49:31.968
The Guyver?
You have the Guyver?

49:32.094 --> 49:34.470
Yeah, the Guyver,
that's what you want, right?

49:34.638 --> 49:37.598
Yeah.
Where is the Guyver?

49:40.477 --> 49:43.646
(Striker) What the hell's he doing?

49:46.650 --> 49:49.276
Watch out,
I'll take care of this thing.

49:52.197 --> 49:53.489
Come on.

49:53.657 --> 49:56.033
Look out! Sean! Oh!

49:56.493 --> 49:58.494
Dissed, you homie.

49:59.204 --> 50:01.998
Don't hurt him!
He doesn't know a thing.

50:02.666 --> 50:03.749
Shut up!

50:04.251 --> 50:05.960
Leave her alone!

50:06.086 --> 50:08.170
l do know!

50:28.358 --> 50:30.735
l am the Guyver!

50:55.552 --> 50:57.219
The Guyver?

51:08.065 --> 51:11.317
l said, "Let her go!"

55:12.559 --> 55:14.810
Hurt him bad!

56:35.433 --> 56:37.184
Ahh...

56:38.895 --> 56:41.814
So, that's it,
you do have a weakness.

56:41.898 --> 56:44.441
- A-ha!
- lt's the ball.

56:44.567 --> 56:47.236
He's dead meat.

57:15.765 --> 57:18.183
Come on, save a piece for me!

57:20.270 --> 57:22.062

58:02.145 --> 58:04.396
Oh, my God. What have l done?

58:09.486 --> 58:12.321
Yo, he done killed the wrong chick.

58:13.114 --> 58:13.989
(Guyver) No.

58:16.618 --> 58:17.910
Take him.

58:19.829 --> 58:22.998
No. Mizky. No!

58:23.583 --> 58:27.252
No! No...!

58:29.464 --> 58:31.632
Mizky! Mizky!

58:32.550 --> 58:34.676
(Lisker) Pick him up. Pick him up!

58:43.561 --> 58:46.772
Killed my woman, boy!

58:48.149 --> 58:51.109
Mizky. What have l done?

59:01.621 --> 59:03.288
- Where's Sean?
- Shh.

59:05.500 --> 59:10.045
(Heartbeat quickens,
breathing intensifies)

59:23.059 --> 59:24.935
No!

59:27.063 --> 59:29.648
No, Sean!

59:29.774 --> 59:31.233
No!

59:46.874 --> 59:48.500
Shit!

01:00:09.397 --> 01:00:12.774
That's the Guyver?
Ha! Nothing to it.

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:17.070
Ha-ha! Ha-ha!

01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:21.575
- Come here, my man.
- Max!

01:00:22.368 --> 01:00:24.119
(Screams)

01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:01.948
There, there, my dear.

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:06.328
lt's all right.
l'm your friend.

01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:10.499
- Who are you?
- Fulton Balcus.

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:13.126
l'm Chairman of the Board
of the Chronos Corporation.

01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:15.420
l knew your father very well.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:19.257
- What?
- Brilliant scientist.

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:24.680
You have my deepest sympathy,
my dear.

01:01:26.724 --> 01:01:28.850
Oh, my God.

01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:34.189
What about Sean? And Max?

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:37.150
l've gotta...
l've gotta call the police.

01:01:37.276 --> 01:01:39.736
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:43.156
Most regrettable,
but it's all been taken care of.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:47.160
That is not the important thing.

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:54.000
The important thing is,
your friend found a most valuable item.

01:01:55.586 --> 01:01:59.339
l must find out
how he managed to activate it.

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:03.885
- What?
- The Guyver unit.

01:02:08.933 --> 01:02:10.600
Come with me.

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:13.478
l want to show you a few things.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.457
Here we are.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.751
The growth corridor.

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:37.419
What are they?

01:02:37.545 --> 01:02:43.091
These are Zoanoids,
genetically altered human beings.

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:47.512
Huh? You see, my dear,

01:02:47.638 --> 01:02:51.141
a long time ago,
when the planet was barren...

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:59.107
...the aliens descended upon the Earth
and created Man.

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.944
- The aliens?
- That's right.

01:03:03.654 --> 01:03:07.866
Man was created
as the ultimate organic weapon.

01:03:07.992 --> 01:03:11.745
And these are the next step
in the evolutionary process.

01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:15.540
Warriors developed by the aliens
from the human species.

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:21.880
ln times past, they were known
as werewolves, minotaurs, vampires.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:26.718
Can you imagine these lovely creatures
in the White House?

01:03:27.386 --> 01:03:31.932
ln every seat of power,
in every country around the world?

01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:39.189
Then what's the Guyver?

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:43.443
The Guyver is an organic mechanism
created by the aliens.

01:03:44.028 --> 01:03:46.947
lt becomes a protective suit of armour.

01:03:47.573 --> 01:03:50.867
Only one Guyver has been found,

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:55.747
but not one clue on how to activate
that magnificent mechanism.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:59.876
l need your help.

01:04:00.419 --> 01:04:02.462
You saw it work.

01:04:02.588 --> 01:04:05.799
Tell me, how did your friend activate it?

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:07.968
No. l don't know!

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:11.054
l have no idea what he did!

01:04:12.765 --> 01:04:14.724
Grotesque little creatures, aren't they?

01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:20.105
You could easily become one of them.

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:31.116
A rare specimen, indeed.

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:35.287
With beauty like yours...

01:04:37.915 --> 01:04:40.542
...the results might not be so hideous.

01:04:41.586 --> 01:04:44.087
But l make no promises.

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:49.092
Take a look around.

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:53.471
This could be your new home.

01:04:56.017 --> 01:04:57.934
Let me go!

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:01.021
l don't know anything!

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:17.203
Well, l see you found
our inner sanctum, hmm?

01:05:18.372 --> 01:05:19.831
Come.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.585
Let me show you around.

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:29.549
Hmm.

01:05:29.675 --> 01:05:32.844
(Man) No! This is just...

01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:36.431
Ah... Dr East.

01:05:38.059 --> 01:05:40.143
(Creature) Let me out!

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:42.729
- Stop, get away from me!
- Ow!

01:05:45.983 --> 01:05:47.192
There!

01:05:52.573 --> 01:05:53.615
Sir...

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:58.536
Mr Balcus, this is...
This is genetics.

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:01.873
You know, not all mutations
are created equal.

01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:08.797
Oh. New recruit?

01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:13.426
- Dr East, Dr Segawa's daughter Mizky.
- Oh...

01:06:14.845 --> 01:06:17.013
Pleasure to meet you.

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:19.015
Your father was...

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:22.852
...a tragic loss.

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:30.068
Dr East is the head
of our genetics research.

01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:32.988
He worked with your father
very closely on the Guyver.

01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:37.492
ln fact, he's in charge
of the current efforts right now...

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.619
the control metal.

01:06:39.745 --> 01:06:42.914
- Er... l'm sorry, what?
- Any progress?

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.626
The control...? Yes.
Yes, let me show you.

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:54.718
A most interesting sphere.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:57.804
lt's an elegant
and inspired mechanism.

01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:00.306
lt's a real challenge to us all.

01:07:03.227 --> 01:07:05.061
Here it is.

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:11.985
Sean.

01:07:12.945 --> 01:07:16.406
Gordon has been following
a most interesting development.

01:07:16.532 --> 01:07:18.616
A most interesting development,
indeed.

01:07:19.326 --> 01:07:21.703
The crystalline structure
of the control metal

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:25.081
seems to be acting like
a DNA model for the flesh.

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:27.042
lt's like a molecular union,

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:30.211
but with organic
and inorganic compounds.

01:07:32.256 --> 01:07:36.384
ln other words,
we think it's alive, the whole thing.

01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:38.344
And we think it's growing.

01:07:40.514 --> 01:07:42.057
Growing?

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:53.234
Growing what?

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:58.573
Well, it could be cloning itself...
into a new Guyver unit!

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.825
New Guyver unit.

01:08:04.455 --> 01:08:06.164
How fortunate.

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:12.796
Well... maybe we don't need
your help after all.

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:19.928
Except l hate to be rejected
by a pretty face.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.727
lt would be a lot easier
if you simply told me.

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:35.068
Perhaps Dr East should
start the process.

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:38.904
What process?

01:08:40.157 --> 01:08:44.285
Yes... Join your friend.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.584
Oh, Max!

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:55.546
Looks comfortable, doesn't he?

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.174
Stop it! Let him out of there!

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:02.178
Oh, no.
He wouldn't want to, not now.

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:04.346
He enjoys it, believe me.

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:06.307
lt's like being drugged.

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:08.768
What are you doing to him?

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:14.566
- Dr East, get ready for her.
- Yes, sir.

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:16.818
- Prepare the...
- (Mizky) No! No!

01:09:18.612 --> 01:09:22.615
OK, l will tell you.
I'll tell you everything.

01:09:22.741 --> 01:09:24.908
Good. How does it work?

01:09:28.205 --> 01:09:29.997
lt was...

01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:33.334
it was like... like this.

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.461
(Groans)

01:09:36.462 --> 01:09:37.755
Hey!

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:45.596
- (East) What's she doing?
- (Gordon) What's she doing?

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.604
Don't let her get away! Get her!

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:01.779
(East) Let's do it. Let's do it.

01:10:12.249 --> 01:10:14.876
(East) No, not that! Surround her!

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:16.628
Hey!

01:10:18.088 --> 01:10:21.090
There's no place to run.
We're 300 feet down.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.718
Don't be foolish.

01:10:24.428 --> 01:10:27.180
Stand back, or I'll destroy it!

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:28.473
Stop!

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:30.892
- Don't let her do it.
- No, don't.

01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:37.273
Put it down.

01:10:38.692 --> 01:10:41.152
There's no need to get excited.

01:10:41.278 --> 01:10:42.445
Stay back!

01:10:45.824 --> 01:10:49.202
- No one here wants to hurt you.
- No.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.664
l want Max out of that thing.

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:57.627
All right, my dear,
that can be arranged.

01:10:57.753 --> 01:11:00.713
l'm more than willing to cooperate.

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:07.011
Come on, screw this.
l can get it.

01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:13.017
Ah!

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:17.981
Just get it! Get it!

01:11:23.904 --> 01:11:26.948
(Striker) Ah, he swallowed
the control metal.

01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:31.661
l was just doing myjob.
l was just doing myjob.

01:11:35.207 --> 01:11:37.375
Spit it out of there.

01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:39.002
Spit it out!

01:11:40.087 --> 01:11:42.171
- Spit it out!
- l can't.

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:54.767
l can't get it out.

01:11:56.061 --> 01:11:58.062
Well, then, cut him open!

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:07.447
Get it out! Get it out!

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:11.492
lt's growing. lt's growing!

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:49.489
Sean, you're alive!

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:51.032
l came back for you.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:01.376
l killed you once,
and I'll kill you again.

01:13:02.169 --> 01:13:06.339
You can't kill me.
l've been rejected by death.

01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:10.593
Ha-ha! Striker!

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:21.145
Sean, come on,
we have to get Max out of there.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.857
Stand back!

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:29.195
Get him!

01:13:30.447 --> 01:13:31.489
Stay back.

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:40.164
- You must get him.
- No, you get him.

01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:41.666
No, you go get him.

01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:48.631
- Get back.
- No, you get him.

01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:51.467
Jeez, l thought you were dead.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:53.469
Never mind.
Just find a way out of here.

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:54.929
I'll take care of this.

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:57.390
- Be careful, Sean.
- You too.

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.832
Get away! Come here.

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:37.680
Oh, my God.

01:14:41.935 --> 01:14:45.104
Let him go, you big ugly creep!

01:14:47.691 --> 01:14:49.692
(Ramsey) You're mine.

01:14:52.196 --> 01:14:53.654
Get away!

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:02.413
lt's going to be over
in a minute, ha-ha!

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:14.967
Come over here!

01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:22.016
I'll kill you now! Come over here.

01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:28.731
You!

01:15:53.757 --> 01:15:55.466
(Alarm blares)

01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:05.268
(Guyver) Get going!

01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:07.979
I'll tear you apart.

01:16:17.322 --> 01:16:18.781
(Screams)

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:46.767
Come on, hurry up.

01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:51.814
- (Reed) This way.
- (Mizky screams)

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.358
(Reed) Guess not.

01:17:36.568 --> 01:17:38.736
(Snarling)

01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:03.886
Max.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.518
Nice work.

01:18:11.269 --> 01:18:13.354
l'm just doing myjob.

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:55.104
You had your chance.
Now it's mine.

01:18:55.939 --> 01:18:57.189
Bonehead!

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:19.336
Are you OK?

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:35.060
Will you save it for later?
We still got to find a way out of here.

01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:37.271
Yeah, l know the way.

01:19:37.397 --> 01:19:39.148
Come on.

01:19:46.531 --> 01:19:47.823
What's wrong?

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:54.997
My God.

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:56.165
Max?

01:20:04.174 --> 01:20:05.841
(Screams)

01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:19.313
Oh, no!

01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:10.447
Max.

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:29.550
- (Reed) Sean, you've got to help.
- But what can l do?

01:21:32.095 --> 01:21:35.264
lt's too late for me,
but you've got to stop them.

01:21:44.524 --> 01:21:48.402
You're... our last chance.

01:21:49.654 --> 01:21:52.781
Don't let them get away with...

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.283
Max.

01:22:02.125 --> 01:22:04.376
l won't let you down, Max.

01:22:04.502 --> 01:22:06.420
Pitiful little creature.

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:10.966
He wasn't in the soup long enough.

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:12.509
You.

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:18.974
- (Balcus) He would've died anyway.
- Sean!

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:24.021
He's the one! He's the one
who murdered my father!

01:22:24.147 --> 01:22:26.190
Let her go!

01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:29.151
What a splendid creation.

01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:33.948
You're even more gifted,
more powerful,

01:22:34.074 --> 01:22:36.742
than l ever dreamed possible.

01:22:39.996 --> 01:22:43.540
These grotesque mutants
are mere child's play

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:46.001
compared to the Guyver.

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.170
l must have it.

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:49.838
Never.

01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:56.595
l would hate to see something...

01:22:56.721 --> 01:23:02.434
unseemly happen
to such a pretty little thing.

01:23:03.186 --> 01:23:06.063
Let her go. l'm warning you.

01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:10.484
Please, please, no threats.
l'm a civilised man.

01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:13.779
A simple little transaction,
a simple trade,

01:23:13.905 --> 01:23:15.739
that's all that's needed.

01:23:15.865 --> 01:23:18.492
What do you mean?

01:23:18.618 --> 01:23:20.995
l give you the girl,

01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:25.124
you give me the Guyver unit.

01:23:25.792 --> 01:23:28.502
lt is no longer mine to give.

01:23:28.628 --> 01:23:30.963
l am the Guyver.

01:23:33.049 --> 01:23:34.508
Well, then...

01:23:36.928 --> 01:23:38.804
l guess you lose.

01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:41.181
No, you're the one who loses.

01:23:42.142 --> 01:23:45.394
l intend to stop your insane experiments
on innocent people.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.272
Well, then do it.

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:54.945
Come and get me!

01:24:01.661 --> 01:24:02.953
Mizky.

01:24:03.663 --> 01:24:04.913
Sean.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.915
(Maniacal laughter)

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:12.796
Do not rejoice prematurely,
my friends.

01:24:12.922 --> 01:24:17.426
You have yet to see
the true form of the Zoalord.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:20.304
And as the Guyver Zoalord,

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:25.309
my powers will be magnified
beyond belief.

01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:33.567
Holy shit!

01:24:38.323 --> 01:24:40.032
Mizky, get outta here.

01:25:27.997 --> 01:25:29.498
(Roars)

01:26:17.922 --> 01:26:20.924
(Balcus) Now the Guyver is mine!

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.690
What's this?

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:18.941
The suit... it protected me.

01:27:23.529 --> 01:27:24.780
Sean.

01:27:24.948 --> 01:27:27.532
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:27:49.555 --> 01:27:51.515
Sean...

01:27:51.641 --> 01:27:55.143
Don't be afraid, it's just me.

01:27:56.604 --> 01:27:59.564
l know it's you, Sean. l know.

01:28:42.358 --> 01:28:43.650
Wait.

01:29:04.422 --> 01:29:07.341
Well... it's all over.

01:29:12.472 --> 01:29:13.764
Come on.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.309
Let's go home.

01:29:22.982 --> 01:29:25.400
Mm, mm, mm.

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.783
No smoking!

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:45.003
l got a job for you.

01:29:45.129 --> 01:29:46.338
Ah...

01:29:46.464 --> 01:29:48.256
Dy-no-mite!
