00:02.044 --> 00:04.005
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:04.088 --> 00:05.965
- Who are you?
- I'm Paige.

00:06.048 --> 00:07.508
This is a very advanced class.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.969
Do you know how to differentiate
under the integral sign?

00:10.052 --> 00:11.052
No.

00:11.095 --> 00:12.346
Do you know anything?

00:12.430 --> 00:14.223
I know you're in my spot.

00:14.306 --> 00:17.226
These are parents
we can actually relate to.

00:17.309 --> 00:18.853
Sounds good.
Oh, thank you, Lord,

00:18.936 --> 00:20.354
for connecting us
with the parents

00:20.438 --> 00:22.064
of another special child.

00:23.816 --> 00:25.943
You kids are special, too.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.529
I used to work at the practice
with Barry, but I had to quit

00:28.612 --> 00:30.781
once Paige's schedule
started to get busy.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.576
Well, a unique child
can require a lot of attention.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.494
Try all the attention.

00:35.578 --> 00:37.618
Barry, it sounds like
you might be feeling left out.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.123
Sometimes I do.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.375
Don't you get him
another beer.

00:41.459 --> 00:43.461
Oh, come on. You love this,
and you know it.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.546
They're as messed-up as we are.

00:53.929 --> 00:56.724
<i>From a young age,
I was the proud member</i>

00:56.807 --> 00:59.852
<i>of several elite organizations:</i>

00:59.935 --> 01:01.437
<i>The Radio Shack Battery Club,</i>

01:01.520 --> 01:03.856
<i>entitling the bearer
to the incredible bargain</i>

01:03.939 --> 01:06.317
<i>of one free battery per month.</i>

01:06.400 --> 01:08.277
<i>It's no wonder
they went out of business.</i>

01:08.360 --> 01:10.863
<i>Starfleet International,
entitling the bearer</i>

01:10.946 --> 01:12.531
<i>to say things like,
"I'm a member</i>

01:12.615 --> 01:14.325
<i>of Starfleet International."</i>

01:14.408 --> 01:18.662
<i>And best of all, the Natural
Science Museum of Texas,</i>

01:18.746 --> 01:21.582
<i>which included a free
subscription to their magazine.</i>

01:21.665 --> 01:24.335
"The secrets
of carbon isotope dating."

01:24.418 --> 01:26.253
Juicy.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.840
Mom, can you make the salad?

01:29.924 --> 01:31.008
Sure.

01:31.092 --> 01:33.302
Hey, don't put in
any of those little tomatoes.

01:33.385 --> 01:36.305
Hey, I don't tell you how
to impersonate a lump of clay.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.849
You don't tell me
how to make a salad.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.577
There's going to be a lecture
on carbon dating

01:40.601 --> 01:43.020
at the Natural Science Museum
on Saturday.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.563
Who would like to take me?

01:44.647 --> 01:46.524
You know what? I'd be happy to.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.776
What happened to helping me
at my yard sale?

01:48.859 --> 01:50.820
Ooh, is that this Saturday?

01:50.903 --> 01:52.071
I'm sorry.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.594
I'm taking him
to a lecture on, uh...

01:53.656 --> 01:54.990
what is it? Carbonation?

01:55.074 --> 01:57.034
Carbon dating.
A method of determining

01:57.118 --> 01:58.619
the age of artifacts
and fossils.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.664
Hey, we could use that to figure
out how old your grandma is.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.290
That won't work.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.102
You can't carbon-date
something that's alive.

02:05.126 --> 02:08.838
Well, then, we'll just chop
her down and count the rings.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.424
Oh, George, did my "lump
of clay" remark strike a nerve?

02:14.385 --> 02:15.386
A little.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.641
<i>♪♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪♪</i>

02:20.724 --> 02:23.477
<i>♪♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪♪</i>

02:23.561 --> 02:26.063
<i>♪♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪♪</i>

02:26.147 --> 02:28.440
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

02:28.524 --> 02:32.987
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

02:39.034 --> 02:42.580
Dad, do you believe that fossils
are millions of years old?

02:42.663 --> 02:45.040
I guess. Why?

02:45.124 --> 02:49.587
Well, Mom believes the world
was only created 6,000 years ago.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.880
Yeah. So?

02:51.672 --> 02:54.300
Are these differences
a sticking point in your marriage?

02:54.383 --> 02:55.843
Not at all.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.887
- Why?
- Simple.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.513
We never talk about it.

02:59.597 --> 03:02.600
So you just avoid discussing
topics you don't agree on?

03:02.683 --> 03:04.560
At all costs.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.605
Hearing that further convinces me
I'll never get married.

03:08.147 --> 03:09.440
Never say never.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.984
Why not?
You just said it twice.

03:14.278 --> 03:17.239
All right, as soon as I get
these tables set up on the lawn,

03:17.323 --> 03:19.366
y'all can start
bringing that stuff out.

03:19.450 --> 03:22.161
You think you're gonna get ten
bucks for this piece of junk?

03:22.244 --> 03:24.788
Hey, that piece of junk
is a wedding gift

03:24.872 --> 03:26.999
from my cheap-ass
Cousin Betty.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.251
And I was gonna leave
a little room to haggle.

03:29.335 --> 03:31.003
What's a haggle?

03:31.086 --> 03:33.088
Negotiating.
You start high,

03:33.172 --> 03:35.716
they offer less, then you meet
somewhere in the middle.

03:35.799 --> 03:38.135
Leaves them feeling like,
you know, they got a deal.

03:38.219 --> 03:40.721
- Did they?
- Not if you did it right.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.514
How much are we getting paid
today?

03:42.598 --> 03:45.351
You're not getting paid squat.
You're helping out your meemaw.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.228
That doesn't seem fair.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.812
Yeah, we should
get something.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.648
Fine.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.732
How much you want?

03:51.815 --> 03:52.816
Five dollars.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.068
- Each.
- Each.

03:54.944 --> 03:56.528
That's pretty steep.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.280
How about I give you
a buck apiece?

03:59.782 --> 04:02.076
Let's meet in the middle...
three dollars each.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.161
Now we're haggling.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.663
Let me ask you a question.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.331
If you break something today,

04:07.414 --> 04:09.375
are you prepared
to cover the cost of that?

04:09.458 --> 04:10.501
- No.
- Nuh-uh.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.878
Mm. Well, we're gonna have
to factor that in.

04:12.962 --> 04:15.756
And did you bring
your own lunch?

04:15.839 --> 04:17.466
You said we were
getting pizza.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.468
Well, I did,
but pizza ain't free.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.178
And I'm teaching you
about negotiating,

04:21.262 --> 04:23.722
which is a pretty valuable
life lesson, right?

04:23.806 --> 04:25.391
Yeah.
I guess so.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.935
So, if my math is right,

04:28.018 --> 04:31.647
you owe me...
two dollars each.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.232
We owe you?

04:33.941 --> 04:35.526
The numbers don't lie.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.861
Dang it.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.780
All right, listen.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.032
I love ya, and you're family,

04:42.116 --> 04:45.119
so if you do it for nothing,
we'll call it even.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.662
Take it, take it, take it.

04:47.496 --> 04:48.914
You got yourself a deal.

04:48.998 --> 04:51.625
Y'all drive a hard bargain.

04:52.293 --> 04:55.379
Now start bringing
that crap outside.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.474
Oh, my.

05:07.558 --> 05:08.892
Yeah.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.519
I bet he dresses down

05:10.602 --> 05:13.439
to about 6000, 7000
pounds of USDA prime.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.773
You'd eat him?

05:14.857 --> 05:16.025
He'd eat me.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.613
Wow. You're really
cleaning house.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.324
Got to get rid of
the old gar-bage,

05:23.407 --> 05:25.701
make room for the new gar-bage.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.411
This was Dad's.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.705
You're not getting
rid of this, are you?

05:29.788 --> 05:30.974
Didn't need it when he shot it,

05:30.998 --> 05:32.267
didn't need it
when he stuffed it,

05:32.291 --> 05:34.168
- don't need it now.
- Really?

05:34.251 --> 05:36.045
It was his first
attempt at taxidermy.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.129
He was so proud.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.006
If it has sentimental
value to you,

05:39.089 --> 05:40.591
I'll let you have it
for five dollars.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.301
Ooh. For this nasty thing?

05:44.094 --> 05:46.847
Oh, you're selling
his golf clubs, too?

05:46.930 --> 05:48.515
Which one of your
children do you see

05:48.599 --> 05:50.642
hanging out with Arnold
Palmer in the future?

05:50.726 --> 05:54.229
Dad's clothes,
his shoes, his pipes?

05:54.313 --> 05:56.398
Honey, it's just stuff.

05:56.482 --> 05:58.150
I know, but still...

05:58.233 --> 05:59.777
I get how you're feeling.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.195
I do.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.404
Now go away.

06:02.488 --> 06:04.698
I got a lot of crap to sell.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.579
All right, now,
don't wander off.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.498
Pick you up right after
the lecture's over.

06:12.581 --> 06:13.749
Bye.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.002
You gonna be okay by yourself?

06:17.086 --> 06:19.630
I actually prefer it.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.883
Well, I'm leaving.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.428
You keep saying that,
but then you don't do it.

06:27.930 --> 06:29.348
Bye.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.934
He's so needy.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.685
Sheldon?

06:34.770 --> 06:37.564
- Paige?
- I'm so happy to see you.

06:37.648 --> 06:38.982
Are you happy to see me?

06:39.066 --> 06:40.692
Not immediately.

06:40.776 --> 06:41.777
That's okay.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.987
I'm happy enough
for both of us.

06:47.825 --> 06:50.619
<i>- Rice Stadium in Houston.
- Dave Barnett and Dave Rowe.</i>

06:50.702 --> 06:54.331
And Baylor's bidding to go up
14 to nothing.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.834
And if you're Rice right now,
and you're in that huddle...

06:56.917 --> 06:58.127
George?

06:58.210 --> 06:59.795
Oh...

07:00.337 --> 07:02.464
- Hi.
- Oh, Paige's mom.

07:02.548 --> 07:03.674
I know.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.218
What a nice surprise.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.421
I just dropped Paige off
at the carbon-dating lecture.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.805
And I dropped Sheldon.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.098
Well, how about that?

07:11.181 --> 07:13.100
How about it.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.310
Mind if I join you?

07:16.145 --> 07:17.646
Sure.

07:20.983 --> 07:24.445
So, uh, where's your...
your hubby?

07:24.528 --> 07:26.321
- Oh, Barry?
- Barry. Yeah.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.323
Who cares?

07:29.408 --> 07:30.576
That doesn't sound good.

07:30.659 --> 07:33.579
Oh, sorry. Just ignore me.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.539
Okay.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.124
Oh, hey, you want a wing?

07:37.708 --> 07:39.376
Yeah, no, thank you.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.962
You mind if I watch the game?

07:42.045 --> 07:44.214
Oh, no, not at all. Enjoy.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.759
I'll just see
what kind of pie they have.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.553
Mm-hmm.

07:52.598 --> 07:55.058
<i>Well, we were here
last year when Arkansas...</i>

07:58.770 --> 08:00.939
It's getting a little tougher
to ignore you.

08:01.023 --> 08:03.525
Oh, I'm sorry. It's just...

08:03.609 --> 08:05.402
Oh... forget it.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.113
- Okeydoke.
- Fine, I'll tell you.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.866
Barry and I
haven't been in a good place

08:10.949 --> 08:12.784
in a long time, and I...

08:13.577 --> 08:15.746
I think we're headed for divorce.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.041
I'm sorry. Uh...

08:19.708 --> 08:20.918
I don't know what to say.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.920
Uh, oh.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.130
You don't have to say anything.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.508
That I can do.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.301
Oh.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.803
They have cobbler.

08:31.887 --> 08:35.097
<i>Rupert Taylor
got the block, and Charles...</i>

08:35.182 --> 08:37.100
All right, everybody, welcome.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.269
Glad to see
we got so many people interested

08:39.352 --> 08:41.270
in radioactive decay.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.606
Well, hello.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.067
- Hi.
- This is a nice surprise.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.486
I don't usually see
young people at my lectures.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.364
I enjoyed your paper on
accelerator mass spectrometry,

08:50.447 --> 08:52.032
and wanted to find out more.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.242
Is that so?

08:54.368 --> 08:55.869
And you?

08:55.953 --> 08:57.704
I read this magazine.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.122
Uh-huh.

08:59.790 --> 09:01.250
It has puzzles, too.

09:02.584 --> 09:03.585
Okay.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.588
Do you want to kick this off

09:06.672 --> 09:08.757
and tell us
exactly what carbon dating is?

09:08.840 --> 09:12.344
The 5,730-year half-life
of carbon 14

09:12.427 --> 09:13.971
is used as a geochronometer.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.723
Anything else you'd like to add?

09:18.809 --> 09:20.477
Um...

09:20.561 --> 09:23.939
carbon dating is how we figured
out how old my grandmother is.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.153
<i>It was at this moment I learned</i>

09:30.237 --> 09:33.907
<i>I was not only brilliant;
I was also hilarious.</i>

09:42.708 --> 09:45.586
I mean, you, of all people,
would understand.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.629
You've got a special child
of your own.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.715
I do, I do.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.593
How do you and Mary
handle the stress?

09:52.676 --> 09:55.137
Well, we actually have
a pretty good system.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.680
Oh, please tell me.

09:57.306 --> 09:59.016
We don't talk about it.

09:59.641 --> 10:00.684
Not at all?

10:00.767 --> 10:01.935
Zippo.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.855
Boy, that doesn't sound
like it could work.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.066
Suit yourself,
but I'm having a nice day.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.110
You're crying
into your peach cobbler.

10:11.069 --> 10:14.615
For now, let's neglect changes
in the isotopic

10:14.698 --> 10:18.368
ratio of the air
over thousands of years.

10:18.452 --> 10:21.038
This is pretty basic stuff.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.956
Yes.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.125
I'm bored.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.251
Let's get out of here.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.295
I can't. I told my dad

10:28.378 --> 10:30.797
I'd stay here until
the end of the lecture.

10:31.423 --> 10:34.426
Okay. Be a baby.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.053
I'm leaving.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.055
In our case,
the math yields

10:38.138 --> 10:42.309
approximately
48,000 years.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.311
<i>I was most certainly
not a baby.</i>

10:44.394 --> 10:46.396
<i>If anyone was a baby,
it was she,</i>

10:46.480 --> 10:48.160
<i>because people
who call other people babies</i>

10:48.231 --> 10:49.941
<i>are the real babies.</i>

10:50.942 --> 10:52.527
Wait up.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.118
I like it.

11:00.202 --> 11:01.370
It likes you.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.455
How much?
Five dollars.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.374
I only have 50 cents.

11:05.457 --> 11:06.958
That's okay.
We're haggling.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.169
I don't know what that means.

11:09.252 --> 11:11.630
You make me an offer,
and we meet in the middle.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.674
The middle of what?

11:14.883 --> 11:16.843
I'm not really sure.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.640
Hmm.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.898
What are you doing?

11:29.981 --> 11:32.651
Considering buying this jacket.

11:32.734 --> 11:36.029
I found chewing tobacco
and Juicy Fruit in the pocket.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.615
Does that come with it,
or is it extra?

11:40.158 --> 11:41.702
Actually, that's not for sale.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.495
Why don't you look
for something else?

11:43.578 --> 11:45.497
You sure?
There's a price tag on it.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.249
Just take it off.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.001
Is this some kind
of bargaining technique?

11:50.085 --> 11:51.586
Because I should warn you.

11:51.670 --> 11:54.589
I've been to the
bazaars in Istanbul,

11:54.673 --> 11:58.885
where the negotiations are fast,
furious and bilingual.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.554
Just take it off, damn it.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.184
What just happened?

12:07.185 --> 12:09.062
That's my dad's jacket.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.106
Oh.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.234
Still don't know what happened.

12:16.278 --> 12:19.614
Do you think humans will become
extinct like the dinosaurs?

12:19.698 --> 12:22.117
Yes, but before that happens,
some of us will merge

12:22.200 --> 12:24.411
with computers and
become immortal cyborgs.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.288
That's a fascinating idea.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.372
Thank you.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.875
Did you get that
from a TV show?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.168
No.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.504
A comic book.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.509
And then when Paige turned six,
it was obvious

12:39.593 --> 12:40.844
she wasn't like
the other kids,

12:40.927 --> 12:42.697
and she needed a school
where she could excel.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.848
- Uh-huh.
- But Barry's dental practice

12:44.931 --> 12:46.850
was 50 miles
outside of Fayetteville,

12:46.933 --> 12:49.478
and do you know what's available
for extraordinary children

12:49.561 --> 12:51.813
50 miles outside
of Fayetteville?

12:51.897 --> 12:53.815
- I'm gonna guess not much.
- Nothing.

12:53.899 --> 12:55.150
- Mm-hmm.
- So I packed us up,

12:55.233 --> 12:56.586
and I made him move
to Texas where,

12:56.610 --> 12:59.529
believe it or not,
people do get cavities.

12:59.613 --> 13:02.199
I believe it.
I had a humdinger last summer.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.343
- Face swelled up like a cantaloupe.
- And do you know

13:04.367 --> 13:06.203
he's been cool to me ever since,

13:06.286 --> 13:08.205
even though
his practice is making money

13:08.288 --> 13:09.790
- hand over fist.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.166
<i>A flag down...</i>

13:11.249 --> 13:12.518
And as much as he
says I ignore him,

13:12.542 --> 13:14.085
he ignores me just as much.

13:14.169 --> 13:16.505
I mean, would it kill him
to get a babysitter every once

13:16.588 --> 13:18.715
in a while and take me
to dinner, maybe a movie?

13:18.799 --> 13:20.801
- It would not.
- Oh, darn.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.010
You didn't see me.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.389
<i>Then you've got
fourth down, and he throws the...</i>

13:27.265 --> 13:28.517
George!

13:30.268 --> 13:32.395
Hey.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.688
Paige's dad.

13:33.772 --> 13:36.566
Barry. Yeah, of course,
I remember.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.026
What are you doing here?

13:38.109 --> 13:39.444
Uh, just, you know,

13:39.528 --> 13:41.530
Sheldon wanted to go
to a science lecture.

13:41.613 --> 13:42.614
No kidding.

13:42.697 --> 13:43.977
We just dropped Paige off there.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.951
You don't say.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.619
Ooh.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.287
Caveman stuff.
I love that.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.456
Where are you going?
It's closed.

13:51.540 --> 13:54.960
I can read... baby.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.214
Just so you know,
that won't work every time.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.968
You haven't, uh,
seen Linda around, have you?

14:03.051 --> 14:04.511
Linda.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.097
Your wife, Linda.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.015
Yeah. No.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.184
So what's new?

14:11.268 --> 14:12.310
Oh, not much.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.394
Hey, you like football?

14:13.436 --> 14:14.771
No.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.690
Well, you sure?
It's a close game.

14:16.773 --> 14:20.235
Uh, no, no, I'm, uh,
more of a tennis man.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.531
Well, those are two very
different sports, aren't they?

14:24.614 --> 14:26.283
<i>I think you've got to go outside</i>

14:26.366 --> 14:28.326
<i>and rely on somebody like...</i>

14:28.410 --> 14:29.828
George...

14:31.037 --> 14:32.414
can I confide in you?

14:48.722 --> 14:51.892
This is oddly reminiscent
of a dinner with my family.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.602
You're funny.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.270
I know.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.439
My family never
eats dinner together.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.940
Why not?

14:59.024 --> 15:02.360
My dad always manages to come
home from work after we're done.

15:02.444 --> 15:06.156
Hmm. My dad never
misses a meal.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.409
Do you think Stone Age parents
stayed together forever?

15:09.492 --> 15:11.661
They had to.
There were no lawyers.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.163
What?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.414
That was funny.

15:14.956 --> 15:17.000
Right, we've
established I'm funny.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.252
Well, I think my parents
are getting a divorce.

15:19.336 --> 15:20.462
Why?

15:20.545 --> 15:21.963
They fight all the time.

15:22.047 --> 15:24.174
- About what?
- Mostly me.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.719
Hmm. That's too bad.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.095
I guess I'm lucky.

15:29.638 --> 15:30.847
Why?

15:30.931 --> 15:33.183
I'm the glue that holds
our family together.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.894
What are you kids
doing in there?

15:39.522 --> 15:42.192
Okay, ten cents a week
for a whole year.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.904
I get the raccoon, and to tell
people you're my girlfriend.

15:45.987 --> 15:48.990
15 cents a week, and if you
say hello to me in school,

15:49.074 --> 15:50.408
I'll say hello back.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.161
Deal.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.666
Connie, I need to apologize.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.377
Oh, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.337
No, I am worrying about it.

16:02.420 --> 16:06.091
I didn't realize that with you
and I being in a relationship,

16:06.174 --> 16:08.051
me wearing
your dead husband's clothes

16:08.134 --> 16:11.346
would be emotionally
challenging for you.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.099
All right, apology accepted.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.059
Thank you.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.356
Are you okay?

16:24.484 --> 16:28.655
I guess I just didn't expect
that getting rid of my...

16:28.738 --> 16:32.492
my husband's stuff
was gonna hit me so hard.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.872
He must have been
a wonderful man.

16:37.956 --> 16:41.334
Well, he had his moments.

16:41.418 --> 16:45.714
He was married to a wonderful
woman, so that says a lot.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.883
You're pretty
wonderful yourself.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.137
Thank you.

16:52.220 --> 16:56.349
Now, let's talk
about this hula girl lamp.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.476
What's your best price?

16:59.060 --> 17:00.729
It's my gift to you.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.188
Nice haggle.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.523
Nice mullet.

17:05.900 --> 17:06.901
Thanks again.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.529
Real sorry
about this.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.573
What were you
thinking?

17:11.656 --> 17:12.741
I got bored.

17:12.824 --> 17:13.992
'Cause you're a baby.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.075
What happened?

17:15.117 --> 17:16.368
Everything's fine.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.038
They just
wandered off.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.040
Hey, Linda, nice to see you.

17:21.082 --> 17:22.541
George, Sheldon's dad.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.752
Oh, sure, yes. Hi.

17:24.836 --> 17:28.298
Well, good to see you folks.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.051
Take care.

17:33.094 --> 17:36.014
Did you know that her parents
are getting a divorce?

17:36.097 --> 17:38.141
Just keep walking.
Keep walking.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.482
What... what is that for?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.859
Well, can't I
appreciate my wife?

17:47.942 --> 17:49.360
What did you do now?

17:49.444 --> 17:50.612
I didn't do anything.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.614
Want to hear something cool?

17:53.239 --> 17:55.033
Sheldon skipped out
of that lecture

17:55.116 --> 17:57.869
with that little Paige girl,
snuck into a closed exhibit.

17:57.952 --> 18:00.121
- You're kidding.
- True.

18:00.205 --> 18:03.500
Even got, uh, "arrested"
by the museum security cops.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.376
Why would you think that's cool?

18:05.460 --> 18:07.587
Sheldon got into trouble
with a girl!

18:07.670 --> 18:09.464
I'm bursting with pride.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.551
You know what? I don't
want to talk about it.

18:13.635 --> 18:16.346
There, right there.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.264
That's why I love you.

18:28.399 --> 18:29.692
You gonna eat
your beans?

18:29.776 --> 18:32.112
Yeah, I'm gonna
eat my beans. Duh.

18:32.195 --> 18:33.488
What about your tots?

18:33.571 --> 18:35.031
- Those, too.
- Georgie!

18:35.115 --> 18:36.324
Just eat your
own dinner.

18:36.407 --> 18:37.492
Dad?

18:37.575 --> 18:38.910
Can't have my tots, either!
