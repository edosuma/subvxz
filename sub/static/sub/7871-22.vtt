00:14.933 --> 00:16.315
Hmm?

00:17.802 --> 00:20.637
Our first anniversary.

00:20.655 --> 00:22.940
And we're more
in love than ever.

00:22.974 --> 00:26.009
In your face, people who said
it wouldn't last a year!

00:26.044 --> 00:28.328
I stand by my wedding toast.

00:28.363 --> 00:30.948
Let's just enjoy our
happiness, Homie.

00:30.982 --> 00:32.950
Accidental motherhood
is the greatest thing

00:32.984 --> 00:34.651
that can happen
to a woman.

00:34.669 --> 00:38.172
And I think Bart's finally
outgrown his misbehavior.

00:46.014 --> 00:48.215
Oops, better clean that off.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.621
You have a great day, ma'am.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.709
Wish I could get a little
of that attention.

01:01.362 --> 01:02.696
D'oh!

01:02.730 --> 01:03.697
Hey, Simpsons.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.299
Don't mean to be a pesto,

01:05.333 --> 01:07.050
but I'll be happy to watch
your scampi shrimp.

01:07.085 --> 01:09.052
Aw, thanks, Flanders.

01:09.087 --> 01:10.888
Got to warn you,
he doesn't talk much.

01:10.922 --> 01:11.972
Daddy.

01:12.006 --> 01:14.074
He's not your daddy.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.476
Nice daddy.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.094
Moustache daddy.

01:17.128 --> 01:19.213
Good daddy no yell.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.381
Fat daddy smell like beer.

01:21.416 --> 01:24.835
I'll teach you to speak
in complete sentences.

01:24.869 --> 01:28.338
But first, m'lady,
let me escort you to Heaven.

01:28.372 --> 01:30.674
The fancy Swiss chocolate
store on level three.

01:30.708 --> 01:32.059
Oh...

01:32.093 --> 01:36.096
Oh, Homer, you're
the anchor store of my heart.

01:36.147 --> 01:38.398
Just call me Borders Books,

01:38.433 --> 01:41.018
'cause I'll always be here.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.613
Haw haw!

01:52.647 --> 01:55.332
His first word.

02:11.415 --> 02:15.269
Oh, Homie, what a
wonderful anniversary.

02:15.303 --> 02:18.722
Yep, we've got something
money can't buy.

02:18.756 --> 02:20.090
Love on a train.

02:20.108 --> 02:22.425
And I promise
each anniversary

02:22.443 --> 02:24.161
will be better and better.

02:24.195 --> 02:25.913
Oh.

02:25.947 --> 02:28.565
They have to get off
and get back on.

02:28.599 --> 02:31.285
Sometimes you have to
say to hell with rules.

02:35.490 --> 02:38.141
But somehow our anniversaries
didn't get better

02:38.176 --> 02:39.943
than that first one
on the train.

02:39.978 --> 02:43.630
Wait, you named me
after a train?

02:43.665 --> 02:45.799
Yeah, just like
we did with Bart.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.834
Anyway, this year,
I'm gonna re-create

02:47.885 --> 02:50.003
our magical first
anniversary,

02:50.054 --> 02:52.806
ending with a romantic ride
on that...

02:53.875 --> 02:55.792
Why are you taking
away the train?

02:55.810 --> 02:57.794
I'm afraid
no one rides it anymore

03:00.565 --> 03:02.816
So we're replacing it
with something that makes money

03:02.850 --> 03:05.085
and sends people
to the food court.

03:05.119 --> 03:06.186
Step right up.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.487
Medical marijuana.

03:07.522 --> 03:08.689
You got nausea, my friend?

03:08.723 --> 03:10.991
Everyone's got nausea.

03:11.025 --> 03:13.493
And what is your malady, my son?

03:13.528 --> 03:16.096
Uh, I had one,
but I forgot it.

03:16.130 --> 03:17.464
Memory loss!

03:17.498 --> 03:19.266
Could be a brain tumor.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.602
Take this
and go see <i>Fantasia.</i>

03:23.204 --> 03:26.023
Kids, I've only had
three great ideas--

03:26.057 --> 03:29.259
marrying your mother,
using a hot dog as a straw

03:29.277 --> 03:31.895
and this romantic
train ride anniversary.

03:31.929 --> 03:33.730
Sir, I need this train.

03:33.764 --> 03:35.649
Eh, take it home.
It's yours.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.818
Are you sure Mom
is really gonna want

03:37.869 --> 03:39.536
a rusted-out kiddie train?

03:39.570 --> 03:41.004
She won't see it like this.

03:41.039 --> 03:42.823
I'll make this train
look as beautiful

03:42.874 --> 03:45.125
as it did
when this mall was young.

03:45.159 --> 03:48.028
Aw, Dad, I just got
a little twinge in my heart.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.046
Try this.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.480
You stay away
from my kids

03:50.515 --> 03:52.516
unless you're driving
them to school!

03:52.550 --> 03:55.185
So, I'm not babysitting
tomorrow night?

03:55.219 --> 03:56.786
Oh, we're still on
for tomorrow night.

03:59.791 --> 04:02.592
Dad, do we have
to ride like this?

04:02.626 --> 04:06.396
Hey, what could be cooler than a
choo-choo with lollipops on it?

04:06.431 --> 04:10.183
Hey, babies-- where you
going in your baby train?

04:10.234 --> 04:11.985
Babytown?

04:12.020 --> 04:14.855
Shake it off, kids--
they're just jealous.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.190
Hey, lardo, where you
going in your lardo car?

04:17.241 --> 04:18.575
Lardville?

04:18.608 --> 04:20.043
There's no such place!

04:22.880 --> 04:24.181
Okay.

04:24.215 --> 04:25.849
I've entered my billing address,

04:25.883 --> 04:28.885
expiration date... and charged.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.887
We're back
from "Baby Beethovens."

04:33.658 --> 04:37.294
That's Mozart, dummy.

04:37.328 --> 04:38.962
Well, thanks
for watching Maggie.

04:38.996 --> 04:41.365
I just ordered Homer's
anniversary gift.

04:41.399 --> 04:42.883
Must be tough.

04:42.917 --> 04:45.385
Yeah, what size cuff links
do you get an elephant?

04:45.420 --> 04:48.288
Well, in the first place,
the elephant's cuff links

04:48.322 --> 04:49.923
would be the same size.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.625
It's the cuffs
that would be bigger.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.860
As for Homer,
I'm getting him a case

04:53.895 --> 04:55.946
of his favorite snack cakes,
Dolly Madison.

04:55.980 --> 04:58.415
Marge, this isn't
Dolly Madison.

04:58.449 --> 05:00.884
It's Sassy Madison.

05:00.918 --> 05:03.887
Trust me, Homer doesn't care
where the cupcakes come from.

05:03.921 --> 05:07.824
Sassy Madison is a dating site
for married people

05:07.859 --> 05:10.594
who are tired
of the same old dessert.

05:14.532 --> 05:17.417
Check out
their webvertisement.

05:20.204 --> 05:23.590

the end of her wits ♪

05:23.624 --> 05:27.511

05:42.543 --> 05:44.644
It's not cheating if you
don't know the person well.

05:44.679 --> 05:48.181
I just put all my personal
information on their Web site.

05:48.216 --> 05:51.318
So now you're gonna get hit on
by every loser in town.

05:51.352 --> 05:55.989
And this town's got losers like
Mexico has headless corpses.

05:57.492 --> 05:59.976
So many unhappy men.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.478
How sad.

06:01.512 --> 06:03.647
You've got a lot of fish
wriggling in that net.

06:03.681 --> 06:06.383
Maybe I should get married
so I can date these guys.

06:06.417 --> 06:08.452
Selma, cheating is a sin.

06:08.486 --> 06:11.788
As much a sin as not replying
to an instant message.

06:11.823 --> 06:13.490
So, if you'll excuse me,

06:13.524 --> 06:17.227
I've got a lot of sleazy
gentlemen to let down gently.

06:18.529 --> 06:20.009
Are you watching
the commercial again?

06:20.031 --> 06:22.165
I'm a fan of animation.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.700
<i>Oh, Lord,</i>

06:23.734 --> 06:26.369
may thy couplings
stay forever locked,

06:26.404 --> 06:29.806
and may thy dead man switch
never be used.

06:29.841 --> 06:31.007
Amen.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.482
All right, guys,
let's get this train

06:32.510 --> 06:34.177
fixed up for
Homer's anniversary.

06:34.212 --> 06:36.396
But first,
start your power tools.

06:45.006 --> 06:47.390
One more to go, and I'm done.

06:47.425 --> 06:49.559
<i>"Dear Horny in Haverbrook:</i>

06:49.594 --> 06:51.344
<i>"Sorry. I'm not interested</i>

06:58.102 --> 06:59.636
<i>Marge Simpson."</i>

07:00.521 --> 07:02.739
Hi, Homie!

07:02.773 --> 07:05.242
A crazy thing happened
when I was ordering

07:05.276 --> 07:07.010
your anniversary gift.

07:07.044 --> 07:08.445
<i>Don't blow the surprise.</i>

07:08.479 --> 07:09.746
<i>Pretend you forgot.</i>

07:09.780 --> 07:11.214
Uh, anniversary?

07:11.249 --> 07:12.215
That coming up?

07:12.250 --> 07:14.117
Yes, and it's a big one.

07:14.151 --> 07:15.552
Remember?

07:15.586 --> 07:18.421
Marge, I am focused
on this like a laser.

07:18.456 --> 07:19.923
"Laser."

07:19.957 --> 07:21.591
That's a funny word.

07:21.626 --> 07:23.176
It's just "loser" with an "A."

07:23.211 --> 07:25.862
And speaking of losers,
I lost my train of thought.

07:25.897 --> 07:28.765
Oh, and speaking of trains,
wait till you see...

07:29.800 --> 07:31.735
The surprise is safe.

07:31.769 --> 07:34.771
The expression on her face
will be priceless.

07:34.805 --> 07:38.041
He forgot
our anniversary again?

07:38.075 --> 07:41.811
He remembers the exact number
of pork chops in the freezer.

07:41.846 --> 07:43.513
Currently-- zero.

07:46.968 --> 07:49.536
One of those cyber smoochers
wrote me back.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.904
<i>Thanks for your note.</i>

07:50.938 --> 07:52.472
<i>You seem way too nice</i>
<i>for this site.</i>

07:52.506 --> 07:53.640
<i>Why are you here?</i>

07:53.674 --> 07:54.908
Good question.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.961
"I thought I was buying
snack cakes."

07:57.995 --> 07:59.262
<i>That's so cute.</i>

07:59.297 --> 08:00.597
<i>Really, really cute.</i>

08:00.631 --> 08:02.883
<i>You... you are over 18, right?</i>

08:02.917 --> 08:04.968
"I am, and you seem
more interested

08:05.002 --> 08:07.120
in my day than my husband."

08:07.154 --> 08:09.456
<i>I know what it's like</i>
<i>not to be listened to.</i>

08:09.490 --> 08:11.491
<i>Please ignore every</i>
<i>sensible instinct you have</i>

08:11.525 --> 08:13.126
<i>and continue this conversation.</i>

08:13.160 --> 08:16.162
<i>And by the way,</i>
<i>this is my real voice.</i>

08:18.149 --> 08:19.683
Don't worry, Moe.

08:19.717 --> 08:22.185
When Marge is asleep,
I'll sneak back.

08:22.219 --> 08:24.421
Oh, good, the
strippers are here.

08:24.455 --> 08:26.189
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!

08:26.223 --> 08:27.490
That is all coming off.

08:30.645 --> 08:32.812
"Tell me more."

08:37.539 --> 08:39.457
Homie, I bet
you're wondering

08:39.491 --> 08:42.995
why I stayed on the
computer until 4:00 a.m.

08:43.029 --> 08:45.130
Hey, those Yelp reviews
don't write themselves.

08:45.165 --> 08:47.699
Did you know a well-placed
one star can destroy

08:47.734 --> 08:49.835
a mom-and-pop hardware
in nothing flat?

08:49.869 --> 08:52.871
Listen, I want us
to be honest with each other.

08:52.906 --> 08:54.706
<i>Uh-oh. If you're honest,</i>

08:54.741 --> 08:56.375
<i>you'll have to tell her</i>
<i>about the train.</i>

08:56.409 --> 08:57.810
Huh? What train?

08:57.844 --> 08:59.611
<i>How stupid are you?</i>

08:59.646 --> 09:01.680
Hey, thinking
is your department, jerk.

09:01.714 --> 09:03.682
That's what I pay you
in beer for.

09:03.716 --> 09:05.517
<i>Just for that,</i>
<i>I'm not gonna help you.</i>

09:05.552 --> 09:07.853
What? Where are you going,
you...?

09:07.887 --> 09:08.887
Oh!

09:08.922 --> 09:10.155
Um, Marge, I have to go.

09:10.190 --> 09:12.558
What? Now? Why?

09:22.418 --> 09:23.886
He's writing me again.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.405
Better put a stop to this.

09:27.624 --> 09:29.925
Is that him getting the text?

09:32.595 --> 09:33.929
He's in the market.

09:33.963 --> 09:36.932
We might have squeezed
the same tomatoes.

09:36.966 --> 09:38.350
Are you Marge?

09:38.384 --> 09:40.752
Ooh, I'm going to hell.

09:40.787 --> 09:42.754
I'm sorry. I didn't even
know you were here.

09:42.789 --> 09:45.190
What a crazy coincidence
that you buy food, too.

09:45.225 --> 09:48.160
Gee, I thought you'd be
some kind of creep.

09:48.194 --> 09:51.213
But you're actually a
perfectly normal-looking...

09:51.247 --> 09:52.681
Whoa!

09:52.715 --> 09:53.949
"A" is for "apple," right?

09:54.651 --> 09:56.218
Okay.

09:56.252 --> 09:57.219
I'll-I'll just be going.

09:57.237 --> 09:58.420
Wait, wait, wait!

09:58.454 --> 10:00.105
Let me get the stain out.

10:00.139 --> 10:01.540
But not here.

10:02.809 --> 10:05.944
I know a place where no one
in town will see us.

10:10.116 --> 10:11.517
There you go.

10:11.551 --> 10:12.751
Good as new.

10:12.785 --> 10:14.586
Now, let me at least
buy you a coffee,

10:14.621 --> 10:17.039
or dare I say a Danish?

10:17.073 --> 10:18.190
No Danishes!

10:18.224 --> 10:20.592
Sorry. I go to pastry
way too fast.

10:20.627 --> 10:22.194
I want to be very clear.

10:22.228 --> 10:23.929
I'm a happily married woman.

10:23.963 --> 10:25.631
Going on ten years.

10:25.665 --> 10:27.799
The aluminum anniversary.

10:27.850 --> 10:31.803
Nothing turns leftovers
into swans like aluminum.

10:31.838 --> 10:34.273
<i>What the heck am I saying?</i>

10:34.307 --> 10:37.643
<i>Homer's probably at that bar</i>
<i>right now, getting hammered.</i>

10:38.811 --> 10:40.312
All worth it for Marge.

10:40.346 --> 10:41.980
Marge, you are
terrific.

10:42.015 --> 10:45.918
I am so glad I reset my distance
filter from 15 to 25 miles.

10:45.952 --> 10:46.732
Mmm...

10:46.757 --> 10:49.256
Your Homer is
the luckiest man on earth.

10:49.505 --> 10:51.473
Well, he keeps falling
down a cliff and living,

10:51.507 --> 10:53.308
so I guess that's true.

10:53.343 --> 10:56.078
The only time my wife and I talk
is when I apologize.

10:56.112 --> 10:58.413
"Life's an infernal muddle,"

10:58.448 --> 11:00.949
as Mr. Drake says
on <i>Upton Rectory.</i>

11:00.984 --> 11:04.086
Ooh, I love that show.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.187
Isn't it great?

11:05.221 --> 11:07.022
Finally, a reason
to watch TV on Sundays.

11:07.056 --> 11:09.258
Such great characters,

11:09.292 --> 11:11.927
like Buxton,
the scheming larder-keep.

11:11.961 --> 11:15.931
Why can't Lady Cavendish see
he's pilfering the aspic?

11:17.333 --> 11:19.084
Uh, does...
does Homer watch?

11:19.118 --> 11:22.154
He says shows set during
World War I are too sad.

11:22.188 --> 11:24.923
Particularly how everyone's
always climbing stairs.

11:24.958 --> 11:27.960
You are watching the season
finale this week, right?

11:27.994 --> 11:30.028
Yeah. Alone, I'm sure.

11:30.063 --> 11:31.663
Well, we could, uh...

11:31.698 --> 11:33.048
live blog it.

11:33.082 --> 11:35.317
Save that sugar
for your coffee, bub.

11:38.538 --> 11:41.323
♪ I've been working
on the railroad... ♪

11:41.357 --> 11:42.841
Why are you singing that?

11:42.875 --> 11:44.509
Because it's in
the public domain.

11:44.544 --> 11:46.445
Hello!

11:46.479 --> 11:48.997
It's Moe from Moe's Tavern.

11:49.032 --> 11:51.033
Oh, uh, I'd better
take this.

11:51.067 --> 11:53.235
You see, Moe's been
depressed and needs

11:53.269 --> 11:55.971
to hear a friendly voice.

11:56.005 --> 11:59.207
Why the hell are you calling me
at home, you moron?!

11:59.242 --> 12:02.477
Lovejoy went to get a hamburger,
and the whole thing fell apart!

12:02.511 --> 12:04.146
I'm getting cooked
like a cabbage.

12:04.180 --> 12:05.747
Then keep quiet like a cabbage!

12:05.782 --> 12:07.783
All right, all right,
I'll be right there.

12:21.731 --> 12:24.900
Is it me, or did this house
just get classy?

12:28.971 --> 12:31.039
Mom, Lisa made me break a lamp.

12:31.074 --> 12:34.993
Mom, Bart's twisting facts
in an Orwellian fashion.

12:35.028 --> 12:36.995
Can I have one hour
of grown-up time

12:37.030 --> 12:39.131
where you two aren't
tattling on each other

12:39.165 --> 12:41.166
or using obscure
references?

12:41.200 --> 12:42.734
Orwell, obscure?

12:42.769 --> 12:44.202
The author of <i>Animal Farm?</i>

12:44.253 --> 12:46.054
Grampa says
he was a Commie.

12:46.089 --> 12:47.372
No tattling!

12:55.248 --> 12:58.216
<i>Upton Rectory</i> is made possible
by a sizeable endowment

12:58.251 --> 12:59.951
from Hooters Restaurants,

12:59.986 --> 13:02.954
and a generous grant from a man
named Generous Grant.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.295
Are you watching it?

13:10.329 --> 13:11.463
No, I can't.

13:11.497 --> 13:13.365
My wife's watching
a reality show

13:13.399 --> 13:15.600
about a man
who repossesses zoo animals.

13:15.635 --> 13:17.285
Come on, Taser
that flamingo!

13:18.988 --> 13:21.623
Can't believe I'm missing
the finale.

13:21.657 --> 13:24.292
Hmm... Maybe I can help.

13:24.327 --> 13:26.161
Bless it all,
Polly, I love you!

13:26.195 --> 13:27.562
And we shall be wed

13:27.597 --> 13:30.465
by Boxing Day Eve,
aka Christmas.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.001
But Lord Upton has forbidden it,
on the grounds

13:33.035 --> 13:34.836
that he once saw me exchange
pleasantries

13:34.871 --> 13:36.838
with the Egyptian riding master.

13:36.873 --> 13:38.907
Can you follow everything okay?

13:38.941 --> 13:41.676
I guess sometimes
you just don't end up

13:41.711 --> 13:44.012
with the person
you're supposed to.

13:44.046 --> 13:46.314
Marge, can I use your free
Amazon shipping?

13:46.349 --> 13:47.816
Not a good time!

13:47.850 --> 13:49.284
I know your password!

13:49.318 --> 13:52.971
Drake, Polly,
perhaps I was too hasty.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.341
Love should flower,

13:56.375 --> 13:59.978
even an ill-advised alliance
between a coarse Irish maid

14:00.012 --> 14:03.248
and a man who once served me
soup from the wrong side.

14:03.282 --> 14:06.351
He hasn't been the same
since the war, Lord Upton.

14:06.385 --> 14:07.819
Hush, Polly.

14:07.854 --> 14:10.272
Who you marry is none
of your concern.

14:10.306 --> 14:12.858
I have something to say.

14:12.892 --> 14:15.327
The dowager grandmum!

14:15.361 --> 14:17.712
I'm afraid you
cannot marry...

14:17.747 --> 14:20.115
without a proper ring.

14:20.149 --> 14:23.535
Take mine--
the Star of Bombay.

14:23.569 --> 14:25.303
Once again, India is denuded

14:25.338 --> 14:28.106
of her treasure
by the imperialist devils.

14:28.141 --> 14:29.608
Why do we watch
this show?

14:29.642 --> 14:31.209
Because I like
the costumes!

14:36.849 --> 14:38.483
I've never felt
so flushed

14:38.518 --> 14:40.285
after watching
public television.

14:40.319 --> 14:42.954
Maybe sometime we could...
watch it in the same room.

14:42.989 --> 14:43.989
Chat room?

14:44.023 --> 14:44.990
Room room.

14:45.024 --> 14:46.691
Show's over!

14:46.726 --> 14:48.860
That turned
ultra-steamy in a jiff.

14:48.895 --> 14:50.662
I can still hear you.

14:51.931 --> 14:54.099
I can still hear you.

15:00.592 --> 15:02.744
Happy anniversary, Mom!
Happy anniversary, Mom!

15:03.595 --> 15:05.029
Our gift is us!

15:05.064 --> 15:07.899
Three kids with no money,
but plenty of love!

15:07.933 --> 15:10.835
That's great.

15:10.869 --> 15:13.571
I wonder what surprise
your father has in store.

15:17.109 --> 15:18.943
Boy, oh, boy!

15:18.977 --> 15:22.013
Oh, Marge,
I threw my back out!

15:22.047 --> 15:25.366
Can you please refill this
prescription right away?

15:25.401 --> 15:27.535
Where's it from?

15:27.569 --> 15:30.405
It's in Drugtown...
not the nice part.

15:30.439 --> 15:33.775
That'll take hours!
On our anniversary!

15:33.809 --> 15:36.911
And what better way to
spend it than commemorating

15:36.945 --> 15:40.281
the glorious words you
spoke ten years ago:

15:40.315 --> 15:41.549
"for worse." Oh!

15:41.583 --> 15:43.050
Oh!
Ow!

15:44.319 --> 15:45.586
Ooh!

15:49.992 --> 15:51.993
Hmm.

15:53.512 --> 15:54.612
It's working.

15:56.365 --> 15:59.317
She's gone. All right, everyone,
magically appear.

16:05.491 --> 16:08.226
Wow, Moe, great
shrub costume.

16:08.260 --> 16:11.162
Yeah. I sell 'em on the Internet
for like-minded people.

16:11.196 --> 16:13.164
Now, let's lay some track.

16:13.198 --> 16:15.066
You guys are the best.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.667
I just want you to know

16:16.702 --> 16:19.003
when I'm holding Marge
in my arms tonight,

16:19.037 --> 16:21.439
I'll be thinking of all of you.

16:26.779 --> 16:27.929
When does it get better?

16:27.963 --> 16:29.680
When he's 800 pounds
and has to be

16:29.715 --> 16:32.833
cut out of the house
to go to a movie?

16:32.851 --> 16:36.270
I lost my cleaning stick
in my belly fat.

16:36.305 --> 16:37.638
But I found a kitten.

16:38.974 --> 16:41.142
That is so sweet.

16:41.176 --> 16:43.027
There I go again, settling.

16:43.061 --> 16:45.363
Marge, run off with me.
Bring your kid.

16:45.397 --> 16:47.181
I have three kids.

16:47.199 --> 16:49.934
Whoa, you really went all in
with this guy, didn't you?

16:49.968 --> 16:51.786
Get out of my head.

16:51.820 --> 16:53.821
I guess this
is good-bye, then.

Sorry, guys,
you're dead again.

I'm gonna do what I've done
at every key point of my life:

17:35.230 --> 17:36.914
suck it in and smile.

17:38.584 --> 17:42.019
There goes a woman
who's unhappy with her partner.

17:42.054 --> 17:43.871
Yeah, I know
how she feels.

17:43.905 --> 17:45.239
Yeah. What was that?

17:54.783 --> 17:56.250
What the...?

17:56.285 --> 17:58.386
Happy anniversary!

17:59.421 --> 18:02.690

Our train.

18:04.726 --> 18:06.360
You care a lot.

18:06.395 --> 18:09.263
What a wonderful anniversary.

18:09.281 --> 18:11.632
Do you think
we'll last 25 years?

18:11.667 --> 18:12.967
Nothing should.

18:15.404 --> 18:17.972
Trains...
they can fix every marriage.

18:20.576 --> 18:22.043
What the...?

18:22.077 --> 18:25.313
Ugh. Happy moment derailed
by the <i>Bipolar Express.</i>

18:25.347 --> 18:27.732
None of you heard that.

18:27.766 --> 18:29.901
Happy anniversary!

18:29.935 --> 18:32.119
Where is she?

18:32.137 --> 18:34.221
Where the hell
is Marge Simpson?

18:34.256 --> 18:35.640
Ramona, please!
When you asked me

18:35.674 --> 18:37.224
who she was and
where she lived,

18:37.259 --> 18:39.277
I never dreamed you'd
go confront her!

18:39.311 --> 18:41.479
Mmm, I'm Marge Simpson.

18:41.513 --> 18:43.981
So... you're
the kind of man-eater

18:44.016 --> 18:46.417
Hall and Oates
warned us all about.

18:46.451 --> 18:48.419
Hall and Oates?
What's going on here?

18:48.453 --> 18:50.354
Your wife and my husband

18:50.389 --> 18:52.690
have been watching
British TV together!

18:52.724 --> 18:54.625
Costume drama
or naughty comedy?

18:54.676 --> 18:56.310
Drama! Drama!

18:56.345 --> 18:59.764
You just dodged a bullet,
Mr. Sugarpants.

18:59.798 --> 19:02.333
Ben, Ramona,
I want to tell you something

19:02.367 --> 19:04.702
I've learned over
ten years of marriage.

19:04.736 --> 19:08.105
The secret is: no secrets,

19:08.140 --> 19:10.508
except good secrets
like this train.

19:12.077 --> 19:13.711
My only secrets are:

19:13.745 --> 19:17.148
My marathon time isn't 4:26;
it's never,

19:17.182 --> 19:18.683
I often go online to see

19:18.717 --> 19:20.785
how Lindsay Wagner's
looking now-- fabulous--

19:20.819 --> 19:23.020
and I once pushed a kid
off a swing

19:23.055 --> 19:24.889
and he broke his wrist
or something.

19:24.923 --> 19:28.676
But it's no secret
how much I love my Margie.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.178
Mmm...
Mmm...

19:31.213 --> 19:34.248
Look at them, coochie-cooing
like that time

19:34.282 --> 19:36.751
our connecting flight
was delayed and we got drunk

19:36.785 --> 19:38.686
and friendly
in the Admiral's Club.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.339
That was you? I mean,
it-it was wonderful.

19:41.373 --> 19:43.240
And you're fighting for me.

19:43.275 --> 19:45.693
Maybe that means
you still care.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.028
Of course I do.

19:47.062 --> 19:49.597
Now, let's go home
and spend a romantic night

19:49.631 --> 19:51.899
looking through your computer's
browsing history.

19:51.933 --> 19:54.335
That exists?
Oh, boy.

19:54.369 --> 19:57.722
Honey, just what was going on
with you and that guy?

19:57.756 --> 20:00.825
