All right, all right,
just stay where you are.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.934
I'll send somebody for you.

01:21.968 --> 01:24.400
Dummy!

01:24.434 --> 01:26.033
Jeff...
Yeah.

01:26.067 --> 01:28.501
...go to 45th and Lexington
and pick up Giambalvo.

01:28.534 --> 01:29.534
Okay.

01:32.434 --> 01:33.434
Latka!

01:35.834 --> 01:37.567
What's the big idea
sending Giambalvo out

01:37.601 --> 01:39.300
with a broken gas gauge?

01:39.334 --> 01:42.434
If we paid you by the mistake,
you'd own this place by now.

01:42.467 --> 01:44.534
Okay, it's a deal.

01:46.167 --> 01:48.634
Why do I always have
to get on your back

01:48.667 --> 01:50.868
to get anything done
around here?

01:50.901 --> 01:53.534
You're a lazy, good-for-nothing,

01:53.567 --> 01:54.901
goldbricking foreigner.

01:54.934 --> 01:57.601
All right. I want...

01:57.634 --> 01:59.667
I want to make a grievance.

01:59.701 --> 02:01.234
Oh, you do?

02:01.267 --> 02:02.234
Yes.

02:02.267 --> 02:04.567
Oh, you want to see
the shop steward?

02:04.601 --> 02:05.501
Yes.

02:05.534 --> 02:06.501
Okay.

02:06.534 --> 02:07.501
All right?

02:07.534 --> 02:08.767
All right, that would
be Ben Geretski.

02:08.800 --> 02:09.767
All right.
Mm.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.667
All right, Ben... Ben...

02:12.701 --> 02:14.667
Ben Geretski?

02:14.701 --> 02:18.000
Ben... Ben Geretski?

02:18.033 --> 02:18.934
Hello?

02:18.968 --> 02:21.100
Where is he?

02:21.133 --> 02:23.801
He's off today.

02:23.834 --> 02:25.467
Then what should I do?

02:25.501 --> 02:26.234
Come here.

02:26.267 --> 02:29.100
The rule is...

02:29.133 --> 02:31.234
if the steward isn't around

02:31.267 --> 02:35.467
then you report your grievance
to the shift supervisor.

02:35.501 --> 02:37.167
Okay.
The shift supervisor.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.367
Who is... who is this?

02:39.400 --> 02:40.534
Is me.

02:40.567 --> 02:42.501
What seems
to be the problem?

02:42.534 --> 02:45.734
Well, you're...
you're the problem.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.434
You're making me problem

02:48.467 --> 02:50.367
because you're
always yelling at me

02:50.400 --> 02:52.501
and you're always
calling me names

02:52.534 --> 02:55.033
and you always
make my life bad

02:55.067 --> 02:57.200
and you make me
feel stupid.

02:58.234 --> 02:59.567
( <i>clicking tongue</i> )

02:59.601 --> 03:01.634
You did the right thing
reporting this, Latka.

03:01.667 --> 03:02.868
Thank you very much.
Okay,

03:02.901 --> 03:04.968
now get your foreign butt
back to work.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.200
Okay.

03:06.234 --> 03:08.400
You know, because I can
only be pushed so far.

03:08.434 --> 03:09.767
Right, right.

03:17.067 --> 03:19.200
Uh, excuse me.

03:19.234 --> 03:20.601
Who's in charge here?

03:20.634 --> 03:21.801
I am, ma'am.

03:21.834 --> 03:23.467
I'm Louis de Palma.

03:23.501 --> 03:25.200
Well, how do you do?

03:25.234 --> 03:26.868
I'm looking for Alex Rieger.

03:26.901 --> 03:28.868
Well, you came
to the right place.

03:28.901 --> 03:31.334
If there's one thing
that I will not tolerate

03:31.367 --> 03:35.267
that is my drivers harassing
the people of this city,

03:35.300 --> 03:38.067
especially an attractive
lady like yourself.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.767
Where did he grab you?

03:40.801 --> 03:42.267
You don't understand.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.634
He's my brother.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.701
That makes you
Alex's sister.

03:45.734 --> 03:47.701
We couldn't help
but overhear.

03:47.734 --> 03:50.200
I didn't know
Alex had a sister.

03:50.234 --> 03:52.634
Alex never did talk much
about his family.

03:52.667 --> 03:53.901
I'm Charlotte Rieger.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.300
We're all his friends.

03:55.334 --> 03:57.033
This is Elaine Nardo

03:57.067 --> 03:58.901
and I'm Mr. Tony Banta.

03:58.934 --> 04:01.601
And you can meet
Mr. Bobby Wheeler momentarily.

04:01.634 --> 04:03.834
But, right now,
I believe he's in the can.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.934
I'm looking forward to it.

04:06.968 --> 04:08.133
Hey, Bob... Hey, Bob...

04:08.167 --> 04:09.000
this is Charlotte
Rieger, Alex's sister.

04:09.033 --> 04:11.100
This is the guy
I was telling you about--

04:11.133 --> 04:12.400
Bobby Wheeler.

04:12.434 --> 04:13.567
Hi.

04:13.601 --> 04:14.901
ELAINE:
Oh, and this
is Latka Gravas.

04:14.934 --> 04:16.200
Oh, never mind him.

04:16.233 --> 04:18.200
How do you do?

04:18.233 --> 04:19.434
Hello.

04:19.466 --> 04:21.934
You are a very pretty lady.

04:21.968 --> 04:25.033
In my country,
we have a saying:

04:49.200 --> 04:52.934
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

04:52.968 --> 04:54.868
You know Latka's language?

04:54.901 --> 04:56.501
Yes. I'm multilingual.

04:56.534 --> 04:58.968
I spent several years
in Europe.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.934
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

05:06.033 --> 05:07.501
( <i>speaking</i>
 <i>same language</i> )

05:07.534 --> 05:08.767
Okay.

05:08.801 --> 05:10.767
Interesting person.

05:10.801 --> 05:13.367
Too bad his grammar
is so poor.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.667
Latka's grammar's bad?

05:15.701 --> 05:17.968
Yes. He's from the lower class.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
My guess would be
his family herded swine.

05:21.033 --> 05:23.868
My guess is they dated them.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.033
Why don't we
sit down, okay?

05:27.067 --> 05:29.868
Are you a New Yorker,
Miss Rieger?

05:29.901 --> 05:32.200
Not anymore.
I live in East Hampton.

05:32.234 --> 05:36.000
To me, New York is just
a quiet rainy yesterday.

05:36.033 --> 05:37.801
You said it.

05:37.834 --> 05:40.834
Well, um...

05:40.868 --> 05:43.334
I was in Manhattan this evening.

05:43.367 --> 05:47.534
I was at a fund-raising dinner,
but I was called away.

05:47.567 --> 05:49.467
Oh!
What are you raising funds for?

05:49.501 --> 05:52.501
Starving something.

05:57.434 --> 05:59.133
Do you expect Alex soon?

06:00.300 --> 06:01.634
I'll tell you...

06:01.667 --> 06:02.834
He should be in
momentarily.

06:02.868 --> 06:05.000
Would you care to wait
in my office?

06:05.033 --> 06:08.534
I'd rather be the only woman
on a Greek freighter.

06:15.367 --> 06:17.868
I wanted very much
to talk to Alex,

06:17.901 --> 06:20.334
but I'm afraid
I just can't wait.

06:20.367 --> 06:22.300
Well, I can take a message.

06:22.334 --> 06:24.868
I wanted to tell him myself.

06:24.901 --> 06:29.167
 Uh, you see, uh, my...
 <i>our</i> father had a heart attack.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.534
Is he all right?

06:30.567 --> 06:32.634
His condition
is stabilized now.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.634
He's over
at New York Hospital.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.767
Let me give you
the room number.

06:36.801 --> 06:39.167
Well, Alex should
be here any second,

06:39.200 --> 06:41.834
and I'm sure he'll go
right over there.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.167
( <i>wry laugh</i> )

06:43.200 --> 06:45.167
It was nice meeting you all.

06:47.634 --> 06:50.400
I wonder what
"uh, huh-huh, huh-huh" means.

06:50.434 --> 06:52.200
Poor Alex.

06:52.234 --> 06:53.534
Yeah. Geez.

06:53.567 --> 06:54.934
When he hears this,

06:54.968 --> 06:56.534
he's going to be in no shape
to drive tonight...

06:56.567 --> 06:57.767
He sure isn't.

06:57.801 --> 07:01.567
...so don't tell him
till morning.

07:01.601 --> 07:04.501
Man, the traffic out there
is unbelievable tonight.

07:04.534 --> 07:05.834
Hello, everybody.

07:05.868 --> 07:07.501
Hey, listen, Louie, Louie,
I'm ready to go,

07:07.534 --> 07:09.167
as soon as you check
me out. Let's go!

07:09.200 --> 07:11.868
Uh, Alex,
your sister was here.

07:11.901 --> 07:13.567
Huh? Charlotte?

07:13.601 --> 07:15.434
Really? Right...?
Well, where'd she go?

07:15.467 --> 07:16.734
Alex, I'm really sorry.

07:16.767 --> 07:18.434
Your father had
a heart attack.

07:18.467 --> 07:21.033
He's in the New York Hospital,
and here's the room number.

07:22.934 --> 07:25.534
Come on, Louie, I want
to get on the road.

07:25.567 --> 07:26.634
Alex, your father had...

07:26.667 --> 07:28.067
I heard you, Elaine.
Thanks.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.734
Come on, Louie, let me
get on the road here.

07:29.767 --> 07:31.434
Hey, Alex...
Huh?

07:33.567 --> 07:35.467
Uh, look,
let me explain something.

07:35.501 --> 07:37.234
My father and I are not close.

07:37.267 --> 07:40.501
In fact, we haven't talked to
each other in almost 30 years.

07:40.534 --> 07:41.868
Look, if the situation
was reversed,

07:41.901 --> 07:43.267
he wouldn't be coming to see me.

07:49.300 --> 07:52.300

Knock it off!

08:33.200 --> 08:35.000
You guys
shouldn't be fighting.

08:35.033 --> 08:36.133
You're like brothers.

08:36.167 --> 08:39.234
You're both from countries
you have to take pills for.

Oh, not you.

08:47.300 --> 08:48.734
You.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.467
Hello.
Hi, everybody.

08:55.501 --> 08:56.801
Oh, Alex...

08:56.834 --> 09:00.701
um, we've been
talking it over, and, uh...

09:00.734 --> 09:02.367
we're sorry about last night.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.200
Yeah, uh, hey, we didn't
mean to pressure you,

09:04.234 --> 09:05.701
you know, buddy?
All right.

09:05.734 --> 09:07.200
It's your business, Alex.

09:07.234 --> 09:10.334
Right, so, uh, if you don't want
to talk about it with us,

09:10.367 --> 09:12.868
well, we love you enough
to understand.

09:12.901 --> 09:15.000
Thanks a lot, guys.

09:18.367 --> 09:20.434
You mean you don't?

09:20.467 --> 09:21.567
I don't want to say anything

09:21.601 --> 09:23.067
because I haven't got
anything to say.

09:23.100 --> 09:25.200
Alex, can I speak to you?

09:25.234 --> 09:26.267
( <i>grumbling</i> )

09:26.300 --> 09:27.701
Uh, what?

09:27.734 --> 09:29.234
Louie, what?

09:31.367 --> 09:35.567
Look, you've done me
a couple of favors in the past

09:35.601 --> 09:37.868
and so I feel like
I owe you one,

09:37.901 --> 09:40.767
so if you want to talk about
this problem man-to-man...

09:40.801 --> 09:42.100
No, thanks, Louie.

09:42.133 --> 09:45.701
Okay, I understand,
but we're even now.

09:45.734 --> 09:47.934
Right.

09:47.968 --> 09:50.868
Look, everybody, I appreciate
you trying to help me,

09:50.901 --> 09:52.100
but there's
absolutely no...

09:52.133 --> 09:54.367
Alex? Alex?
What?

09:54.400 --> 09:57.701
Eh, you know, in my country,
we have a saying:

09:57.734 --> 10:01.868
"Your father, he may beat you,

10:01.901 --> 10:05.200
"your father,
he may curse you...

10:05.234 --> 10:09.067
your father, he may take
your last bit of meat."

10:12.234 --> 10:13.033
Go on.

10:13.067 --> 10:15.000
That's all.

10:17.567 --> 10:20.834
You mean... you mean,
that's the whole saying?

10:20.868 --> 10:23.000
Yeah, it's a small country.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.901
Thanks, Latka.

10:27.934 --> 10:29.734
Alex...

10:29.767 --> 10:32.400
Oh. Charlotte.

10:32.434 --> 10:33.968
How's, uh...?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
( <i>kiss</i> )

10:36.033 --> 10:37.334
How is, uh...?

10:37.367 --> 10:39.067
His condition is the same;
he's still unconscious

10:39.100 --> 10:40.300
but the doctor said
he may come around.

10:40.334 --> 10:42.067
Maybe we can talk
to him this afternoon.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.701
Charlotte...

10:44.934 --> 10:46.567
Listen, the doctor
was concerned.

10:46.601 --> 10:48.400
Alex, Dad is not
a young man.

10:48.434 --> 10:50.234
I am not going
to the hospital.

10:50.267 --> 10:53.334
I expected you to say that and
I'm prepared to deal with it.

10:53.367 --> 10:54.534
I'm going to change your mind.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.501
Now, Charlotte, don't start.

10:56.534 --> 10:57.934
I am not going to leave here

10:57.968 --> 11:00.300
until you agree
to come to the hospital.

11:00.334 --> 11:02.033
I'm not going!

11:02.067 --> 11:03.634
You know, we haven't
seen each other

11:03.667 --> 11:05.200
for the past couple
of years, Alex.

11:05.234 --> 11:06.968
Maybe you've
forgotten just how

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
determined and willful

11:08.033 --> 11:09.767
I can be.

11:09.801 --> 11:11.767
Whoo!
Just the way I like 'em.

11:11.801 --> 11:14.300
Is there a place
that we could be alone?

11:14.334 --> 11:15.901
Or, at least, safe?

11:15.934 --> 11:16.601
If we haven't got
anything to say,

11:16.634 --> 11:18.367
we don't need
a place to say it.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.934
You can use
Latka's tool room.

11:19.968 --> 11:21.767
Elaine!
Through that door.

11:21.801 --> 11:23.467
Come along.

11:23.501 --> 11:24.634
No, Charlotte!

11:24.667 --> 11:27.000
Now, look, Charlotte, if you
want to chat socially, fine,

11:27.033 --> 11:28.400
but I'm not going
into that tool room

11:28.434 --> 11:29.567
to talk about Joe.

11:29.601 --> 11:30.667
Nah! No way!

11:30.701 --> 11:32.200
Alex, do you remember
when we were kids

11:32.234 --> 11:35.634
and I wanted to do something
and you didn't want to do it,

11:35.667 --> 11:37.200
how I could persuade you
to change your mind

11:37.234 --> 11:39.167
with that little ploy
I used to use?

11:39.200 --> 11:40.367
Aw, come on.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.934
You don't think that
would work now, do you?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.400
All right. Let's talk.

11:47.434 --> 11:49.834
What'd she used to do?

11:49.868 --> 11:51.267
She used to beat
the heck out of me.

11:56.334 --> 11:57.367
Don't shoot.
I'll talk.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.534
Huh?

11:58.567 --> 12:00.100
Oh, Alex.

12:00.133 --> 12:03.100
Oh, <i>abi deeba suboflay.</i>

12:03.133 --> 12:05.067
 <i>Abi deebo subo</i> flee.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.801
 Oh, <i>suboflee. Suboflee.</i>

12:07.834 --> 12:09.334
 <i>Suboflee.</i>

12:09.367 --> 12:13.334
( <i>speaking Latka's language</i> )

12:13.367 --> 12:14.434
Me?

12:14.467 --> 12:15.701
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

12:15.734 --> 12:16.701
 <i>Rapo.</i>

12:16.734 --> 12:19.434
Ah, okay, I will take my things.

12:19.467 --> 12:21.234
 <i>Aruskala.</i>
Thanks.

12:22.501 --> 12:25.567
 <i>Abi deebo suboflee.</i>

12:25.601 --> 12:27.868
 <i>Abi deebo suboflee.</i>

12:32.601 --> 12:34.100
 <i>Suboflee.</i>

12:34.133 --> 12:35.634
Gee, thanks, Latka.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.033
Thank you.

12:37.067 --> 12:38.601
Thank you both.

12:46.267 --> 12:48.934
( <i>loud crashing</i> )

12:53.634 --> 12:54.801
Alex...

12:58.400 --> 12:59.901
Listen, Alex,

12:59.934 --> 13:01.734
if you don't see
our father today,

13:01.767 --> 13:04.000
you may never get
the chance to see
him again.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.467
Are you prepared
for that?

13:05.501 --> 13:06.501
Probably not.

13:06.534 --> 13:08.334
But I've lived
with a lot of things

13:08.367 --> 13:10.133
I'm not prepared to live with.

13:10.167 --> 13:13.067
Do you know what I was thinking
of on the way over here?

13:13.100 --> 13:15.267
I was thinking
of Scheherazade.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.634
I'm glad you didn't
make me guess.

13:17.667 --> 13:19.934
The cat we had when
we were children.

13:19.968 --> 13:21.334
Don't you remember?

13:21.367 --> 13:22.667
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:22.701 --> 13:25.367
We had a terrible argument
over that name, I remember.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.634
I wanted to name her
something silly, like Taffy.

13:28.667 --> 13:30.834
Thank God
calmer heads prevailed.

13:30.868 --> 13:34.701
Do you remember what happened
when Scheherazade passed away?

13:34.734 --> 13:36.133
She got run over.

13:36.167 --> 13:38.634
Yes, while you were away
at camp.

13:38.667 --> 13:41.667
And when we told you,
you were very distraught.

13:41.701 --> 13:44.067
And do you know what
bothered you the most?

13:44.100 --> 13:46.300
That you weren't there
when it happened.

13:46.334 --> 13:49.133
You didn't get a chance
to say goodbye

13:49.167 --> 13:51.534
to that little animal
you loved.

13:51.567 --> 13:53.868
Yeah, she was a great cat.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.767
The only cat I ever knew
that could actually fetch.

13:56.801 --> 13:59.834
Remember when I used to roll
the little ball for her,

13:59.868 --> 14:01.367
Alex...
she used to run...

14:01.400 --> 14:04.133
I'm not here to talk
about that stupid cat.

14:04.167 --> 14:07.734
Tell me what could
our father have
done, that you could

14:07.767 --> 14:09.667
possibly refuse...
"Our father"?

14:09.701 --> 14:11.901
Define "father" for me,
would you?

14:11.934 --> 14:13.467
Now, come on,
you know as well as I do.

14:13.501 --> 14:15.968
After he left,
we were on lousy welfare,

14:16.000 --> 14:19.400
while he was earning
350 bucks a week!

14:19.434 --> 14:20.901
And now I'm supposed to go
to the hospital

14:20.934 --> 14:22.234
just because he's had
a heart attack,

14:22.267 --> 14:23.467
and have a scene with him

14:23.501 --> 14:24.701
that'll be a lie
for both of us.

14:24.734 --> 14:27.067
You cannot stay this mad
for so long, Alex!

14:27.100 --> 14:28.367
No, no, no, no,
look, I'm not mad.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.734
I just want to get
the facts straight.

14:30.767 --> 14:33.000
You know,
I remember all those times

14:33.033 --> 14:35.734
coming home from school,
when our mother was working,

14:35.767 --> 14:38.167
and finding him there
with another woman!

14:38.200 --> 14:41.901
He said, "This is your aunt.
Don't tell your mother."

14:41.934 --> 14:43.100
I know.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.501
He was my father, too,
you remember.

14:45.534 --> 14:48.467
I was very well aware
of his indiscretions.

14:48.501 --> 14:49.834
I was just about 11

14:49.868 --> 14:51.901
when I found out
he was fooling around.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.934
They asked me to write
an essay, in school,

14:53.968 --> 14:57.601
on my father's
favorite hobby.

14:57.634 --> 15:00.634
I said
he collected stamps.

15:00.667 --> 15:04.234
Cheap stamps.

15:04.267 --> 15:09.434
Cheap, dirty stamps.

15:09.467 --> 15:11.334
Yeah.

15:11.367 --> 15:12.701
Right.

15:12.734 --> 15:14.534
All right, all right.

15:14.567 --> 15:17.000
It's not so easy for me
to forget that.

15:17.033 --> 15:18.367
But I try.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.801
Why can't you?

15:19.834 --> 15:21.400
Oh, come on, Charlotte!

15:21.434 --> 15:22.601
It was very different with you.

15:22.634 --> 15:24.801
He had an entirely
different relationship with you.

15:24.834 --> 15:26.934
You were his darling
little daughter-- hmph!

15:26.968 --> 15:29.767
I remember he even paid
for your tuition one year.

15:29.801 --> 15:31.734
Oh, yes, and on
your 21st birthday,

15:31.767 --> 15:33.534
he gave you a
very special gift.

15:33.567 --> 15:34.534
A little something.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.234
Yeah, yeah, what was it?

15:36.267 --> 15:38.234
A car.
Ah.

15:38.267 --> 15:41.367
Okay, maybe I did have it
a little better than you.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.901
It doesn't change the fact
he stayed away from me

15:42.934 --> 15:44.767
just as much as he
stayed away from you,

15:44.801 --> 15:46.434
and I forgave him,
and so did Mama.

15:46.467 --> 15:47.701
He didn't even come
to her funeral!

15:47.734 --> 15:49.267
He was there, Alex.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.400
Oh, yeah, that's right.

15:50.434 --> 15:52.000
He was outside
the cemetery gate.

15:52.033 --> 15:53.567
I always thought
it was a coincidence.

15:53.601 --> 15:55.234
He <i>was</i> there.

15:55.267 --> 15:56.834
He brought a date!

15:56.868 --> 15:58.601
He needed emotional support.

15:58.634 --> 16:01.100
She was wearing toreador pants!

16:01.133 --> 16:03.434
I understand your bitterness.

16:03.467 --> 16:04.601
I am not bitter!

16:04.634 --> 16:06.100
I understand
your anger.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.367
I am not angry!

16:07.400 --> 16:08.367
Your pique?

16:08.400 --> 16:09.601
I'm piqued as hell!

16:09.634 --> 16:13.067
Alex, your father may be dying.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.467
You must go!
I'm going to beg!

16:14.501 --> 16:15.534
No, Charlotte, don't beg.

16:15.567 --> 16:16.567
I am! I'm gonna beg!

16:16.601 --> 16:18.501
Charlotte, please don't beg.
I'm begging!

16:19.634 --> 16:20.767
Please go.

16:24.534 --> 16:26.701
You beg bad.

16:26.734 --> 16:28.033
Just see him.

16:28.067 --> 16:29.200
Look at him.

16:29.234 --> 16:31.200
Say, "Hello,
I'm sorry you're dying.

16:31.234 --> 16:32.767
I'll see you around."

16:32.801 --> 16:34.267
If you go
and it doesn't work, so?

16:34.300 --> 16:36.300
But if you don't go,
and he dies,

16:36.334 --> 16:38.133
you're going to
regret it, Alex.

16:38.167 --> 16:40.167
You, not him. You!
You're the loser, Alex!

16:40.200 --> 16:42.968
You... ( <i>anxious sigh</i> )

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
I wish they had sent me
to college.

16:45.033 --> 16:47.300
Then I'd have something
to argue with.

17:00.467 --> 17:01.834
Oh, Miss Stallworth.

17:01.868 --> 17:03.033
Oh, hello.

17:03.067 --> 17:05.501
I came back to see how
your father was doing.

17:05.534 --> 17:07.032
This is my brother Alex.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.032
This is Miss Stallworth.

17:08.067 --> 17:09.267
She was on the scene
of the accident.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.200
Oh, uh, how do you do?

17:12.233 --> 17:14.501
She gave Daddy
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

17:14.534 --> 17:16.099
before the ambulance came.

17:16.133 --> 17:17.467
I hope he's gonna be okay.

17:17.501 --> 17:18.534
Well, the doctor said
he's conscious.

17:18.567 --> 17:19.867
We're going to see him now.

17:19.901 --> 17:21.534
Uh, uh, Miss Stallworth,

17:21.567 --> 17:23.701
where was he when it happened?

17:23.733 --> 17:25.968
Well, uh, he was waiting

17:26.000 --> 17:28.567
on the subway platform
next to me.

17:28.601 --> 17:30.100
Oh? Well, tell me,

17:30.133 --> 17:32.033
was he overexerting himself
in some way?

17:32.067 --> 17:34.267
I mean, was he running
to catch a train or something?

17:34.300 --> 17:37.067
Well, as a matter of fact...

17:37.100 --> 17:39.901
he was goosing me.

17:41.367 --> 17:43.734
Talk about going
with your boots on.

17:43.767 --> 17:46.834
I screamed and
it shocked him so,
he just collapsed.

17:46.868 --> 17:49.501
I really feel responsible,
you know, screaming like that.

17:49.534 --> 17:50.100
Oh, no. No, no.

17:50.133 --> 17:51.734
No, don't, don't, don't.

17:51.767 --> 17:54.901
He must've realized
the risks he was taking.

17:55.934 --> 17:57.901
Listen, Miss Stallworth...

17:57.934 --> 17:59.334
I just want to ask you...
Shall we, Alex?

17:59.367 --> 18:00.534
Excuse us, please.

18:00.567 --> 18:01.868
I'm really sorry.

18:01.901 --> 18:03.033
It's okay.

18:03.067 --> 18:04.267
Look, okay,

18:04.300 --> 18:06.734
if I'm going to do this,
I'm going to have to be alone.

18:06.767 --> 18:08.033
All right.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.868
Wh-Wh-Wh-What am I gonna say?

18:12.901 --> 18:15.901
Tell him a few of the
things that made him
a good father.

18:40.234 --> 18:41.734
Hello.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.567
It's me, Alex.

18:45.601 --> 18:48.200
Alex?

18:48.234 --> 18:49.767
Yeah.

18:49.801 --> 18:51.601
Listen, uh, I, um...

18:51.634 --> 18:53.701
I'm sorry to see you this way.

18:53.734 --> 18:55.000
Thank you.

18:55.033 --> 18:56.901
I'm... a little weak.

18:56.934 --> 19:00.400
Yeah, listen,
just relax, okay?

19:00.434 --> 19:02.033
Just listen, all right?

19:02.067 --> 19:04.200
Um...

19:06.634 --> 19:09.133
Boy, you've gotten so old.

19:11.334 --> 19:14.234
Well, I guess
I've aged too, huh?

19:16.167 --> 19:18.200
Look, uh,
Charlotte insisted

19:18.234 --> 19:19.868
that I come here today.

19:19.901 --> 19:21.334
She, um...

19:21.367 --> 19:24.667
she wanted me to say, um...

19:24.701 --> 19:27.667
I'm not sure what
she wanted me to say, uh...

19:27.701 --> 19:30.267
Well, she thought
it would be a good idea

19:30.300 --> 19:32.701
if I took this opportunity
to tell you

19:32.734 --> 19:36.067
some of the terrific things
that you've done for me.

19:36.100 --> 19:39.634
And, um, although it has been
a very long time,

19:39.667 --> 19:42.734
some of them really stick out,
you know.

19:42.767 --> 19:44.300
Like, uh...

19:44.334 --> 19:45.667
uh...

19:47.667 --> 19:49.734
Yeah, I remember being
really thirsty one night

19:49.767 --> 19:51.267
and you just marched
right in there

19:51.300 --> 19:53.300
with a glass of water.

19:55.234 --> 19:57.567
You didn't
even complain.

19:57.601 --> 20:01.033
I think you put a couple
of ice cubes in it too.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.667
You even took the glass back.

20:03.701 --> 20:06.267
And you kissed charlotte
good night.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.100
Yeah, that was great.

20:08.133 --> 20:10.701
 <i>Seeing</i> all that affection.

20:10.734 --> 20:13.000
And there were other times too.

20:13.033 --> 20:15.000
Uh...

20:15.033 --> 20:16.367
like, um...

20:19.834 --> 20:22.868
you took an interest
in my school, I remember.

20:22.901 --> 20:25.400
Yeah, I remember one time,
in particular,

20:25.434 --> 20:28.868
you asked me
what grade I was in.

20:28.901 --> 20:32.701
And I was such a punk kid,
I didn't even answer you.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.534
It was fifth grade, Dad.

20:37.567 --> 20:40.000
Well, look,
anyway, uh...

20:40.033 --> 20:42.334
whatever you did
or you didn't do,

20:42.367 --> 20:43.634
it got me here.

20:43.667 --> 20:46.000
Hey, you know something?

20:46.033 --> 20:49.601
Uh...

20:49.634 --> 20:52.133
even though
we haven't spoken in 30 years,

20:52.167 --> 20:55.868
and I've never tried
to get in touch with you,

20:55.901 --> 20:58.734
it has made a difference,
your being in this world...

20:58.767 --> 21:00.367
for me.

21:05.901 --> 21:08.367
Look, I lied, um...

21:08.400 --> 21:10.934
Charlotte didn't force me
to come here.

21:10.968 --> 21:13.767
I came because I wanted to.

21:13.801 --> 21:17.234
( <i>voice breaking</i> ):
No, no, I came because I had to.

21:17.267 --> 21:19.701
No, I came because
you're my father.

21:19.734 --> 21:21.167
You're my father.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.701
Oh, damn it,
you're my father.

21:29.634 --> 21:31.634
( <i>sobbing quietly</i> )

21:31.667 --> 21:33.534
Alex?

21:34.901 --> 21:36.300
Hi, Dad.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.968
Oh, my God!

21:41.000 --> 21:42.534
Oh, geez, I'm sorry.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.467
Hope I haven't
screwed things up here.

21:44.501 --> 21:46.534
He a friend of yours?

21:48.601 --> 21:50.567
Well, he is now.

21:50.601 --> 21:53.701
Hey, uh... you two
don't even look alike.

21:53.734 --> 21:55.701
How did I make the mistake?

21:55.734 --> 21:57.601
It <i>has</i> been a while.

21:57.634 --> 21:59.767
Yeah.

21:59.801 --> 22:02.767
I, um...

22:02.801 --> 22:04.267
are you supposed to be up?

22:04.300 --> 22:05.567
Probably not.

22:05.601 --> 22:08.267
I thought you were
in critical condition.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.701
Really?

22:12.367 --> 22:13.667
I feel fine.

22:13.701 --> 22:15.100
Yeah?

22:15.133 --> 22:16.701
( <i>stammers</i> )

22:16.734 --> 22:19.567
I, uh... I came here to see
how you were, and, uh...

22:19.601 --> 22:21.167
this gentleman and I had
a really terrific conversation.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.000
Boy, do I feel stupid right now.

22:23.033 --> 22:24.901
I mean,
I made a big speech to him

22:24.934 --> 22:26.834
about how I felt
about him and me.

22:26.868 --> 22:28.167
You and me.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.467
What did you say?

22:30.501 --> 22:32.501
Well, it was kind of personal.

22:32.534 --> 22:34.701
( <i>anxious laughter</i> )

22:34.734 --> 22:36.534
I don't know.

22:36.567 --> 22:37.934
Um...

22:39.968 --> 22:42.968
Listen, I, uh...

22:46.968 --> 22:50.100
Well, uh...

22:50.133 --> 22:51.501
take it easy.

22:51.534 --> 22:53.100
You too.

22:53.133 --> 22:55.067
Right.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.234
Right.

22:58.234 --> 23:00.300
Well, um...

23:00.334 --> 23:02.634
so long.

23:02.667 --> 23:04.367
So long.

23:09.634 --> 23:10.834
Alex.

23:10.868 --> 23:12.334
Huh?

23:13.767 --> 23:14.868
Oh, yeah.

23:23.267 --> 23:26.567
( <i>singing in Spanish</i> )

23:31.901 --> 23:34.901
( <i>singing continues</i> )

23:34.934 --> 23:36.467
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

23:36.501 --> 23:37.767
 <i>¿Que pasa, que pasa,</i>
 <i>que pasa?</i>

23:40.033 --> 23:41.300

23:41.334 --> 23:42.434
Take a hike, all right?

23:42.467 --> 23:45.834

23:45.868 --> 23:47.100
( <i>yelling in native languages</i> )

23:47.133 --> 23:48.601
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

23:48.634 --> 23:50.133
Come on!

23:50.167 --> 23:52.334
It's quittin' time.
Let's go home.

23:52.367 --> 23:53.601
Take it easy, huh?

23:53.634 --> 23:54.634
Okay, bye-bye.
