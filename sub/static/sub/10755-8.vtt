00:09.275 --> 00:12.725
Anyway, Doc, I got this thing. 
It's, uh, got to do with women.

00:12.902 --> 00:15.688
Well, I sense you're having trouble finding Miss Right.

00:15.862 --> 00:18.980
What, are you nuts? I meet Miss Right most every night!

00:19.155 --> 00:24.360
Eager young college girls, tough career women hungry for a little R-and-R, if you know what I'm saying...

00:24.533 --> 00:27.699
Well, you're leaving precious little room for misinterpretation.  

00:27.869 --> 00:31.911
But I sense, despite these frequent
dalliances, that you're still not truly happy.

00:32.079 --> 00:36.620
Well, sure I am.  It's just that I lost a pinky ring in one of their houses.   

00:39.208 --> 00:41.247
Star sapphire, beautiful thing.

00:41.418 --> 00:45.876
I figured if I went public with it on your show
I had a pretty good chance of getting it back.

00:47.921 --> 00:52.877
Well, Vinnie, it's obvious you know nothing
about this show, or how to treat women.

00:53.049 --> 00:56.796
But even more appalling, you know
even less about jewelry!

00:57.927 --> 01:02.421
A pinkie no more needs a ring than 
a neck needs a gold medallion!

01:02.596 --> 01:06.722
- Just shoot me, why don't you?
- I'd be delighted!

01:06.890 --> 01:09.012
We'll be right back after this.

01:10.267 --> 01:13.136
Hi, Dr. Crane.

01:13.310 --> 01:16.725
- He's driving me crazy!
- Well Roz, we can't all choose our admirers.

01:16.896 --> 01:21.437
It's gone way beyond the admiring stage.
Have you seen this petition he's got going around?

01:27.735 --> 01:33.605
It's to the talented producers of Star Trek
suggesting a new character.

01:33.780 --> 01:38.239
"The all-powerful space vixen... Rozalinda!"

01:41.201 --> 01:47.616
Four-breasted queen of the planet Rozniak!

01:47.788 --> 01:50.112
I'll sign that.

01:53.249 --> 01:56.699
Well, Roz, television will never improve
unless the viewers speak out!

01:56.876 --> 01:59.117
Thanks. I'd better go.

01:59.294 --> 02:02.875
- Well, live long and prosper!
- Oh, just go!

02:03.755 --> 02:05.793
I am the joke of the station.

02:05.964 --> 02:10.957
When I used to come in the morning the
guard would say,"Morning, Roz".
Now it's "All hail, Rozalinda!"

02:12.051 --> 02:14.588
Roz, I think you should be flattered.
Noel's attempt to immortalize you is-is akin to...

02:14.761 --> 02:18.294
a love poem written by 
Robert Browning to his wife.

02:18.471 --> 02:22.763
Did he ever write a poem where he gave her two extra breasts?

02:22.932 --> 02:26.465
Well, I'd have to check my English
Lit notes, but I think not, no.

02:29.352 --> 02:31.427
Hello? Yes?

02:31.603 --> 02:34.473
Niles, Niles, slow down, I can hardly understand you!

02:34.647 --> 02:37.315
- What is it?
- Maris is missing!

02:37.482 --> 02:41.608
What? No, I don't think you should drag the koi pond! 

02:42.651 --> 02:44.773
Listen, I'll be right over!
All right, just hang tight!

02:44.944 --> 02:49.319
- Roz, Roz, how much time left in the show?
- No, you go, do whatever you have to do. I'll handle things here.

02:49.488 --> 02:53.947
- You're sure you can manage?
- If I can nurse quadruplets and still find
time to rule Rozniak, I can do anything!

02:59.202 --> 03:01.692
- All right, what's going on?
- Yeah, Maris is really gone.

03:01.870 --> 03:06.577
- I'm on the phone with the station right now.
- Apparently she just vanished. No note, nothing.

03:07.707 --> 03:11.204
- Oh, Frasier, thank God you're here.
- Any news, Dr. Crane?

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074

03:21.673 --> 03:24.376
But that was weeks ago!

03:24.549 --> 03:27.798
Well, there's no need to panic, Niles.
I'm sure she's all right.

03:27.968 --> 03:31.170
Oh, dear me... I don't want to alarm you Dr.Crane

03:31.345 --> 03:34.546
but I'm getting a very strong vibration off this.

03:38.307 --> 03:42.599
She's waving this poker around and 
screaming,"You thief! Get out!

03:42.768 --> 03:46.182
- You'll never get away with this!
- Wait...

03:46.353 --> 03:51.013
No, I remember. That's what she said to the
decorator when he tried to double-bill
her for the andirons.

03:51.189 --> 03:55.683
I was wondering why the intruder was wearing Toreador pants.

03:55.858 --> 04:00.150
Yeah, Mike, I'm still here. Yeah, that's right, 
she's been missing three days.

04:00.319 --> 04:05.773
Uh,excuse me? She's been missing for three
days and you're just panic-stricken now?

04:07.114 --> 04:10.114
I only just realized it.

04:13.993 --> 04:17.277
The last two nights, I knocked on Maris's
bedroom door to wish her goodnight and 

04:17.495 --> 04:21.988
I was greeted with a chilly silence so,
naturally I assumed everything was status quo.

04:23.248 --> 04:27.789
Uh, thin.  Make that VERY thin.

04:27.959 --> 04:29.868
Caucasian.

04:30.044 --> 04:32.664
VERY Caucasian.

04:32.837 --> 04:35.872
Oh God, what could be happening to her?

04:36.047 --> 04:38.667
Oh, wait, wait, you got something?
O.K., uh-huh, O.K.

04:40.383 --> 04:43.881
Mike ran a check on Maris's credit cards,
there's been a whole bunch of charges
in New York.

04:44.051 --> 04:48.592
Oh, God.  She's been kidnapped.
Someone's using her credit cards.

04:48.762 --> 04:50.635
Yeah, O.K., slow down. Armani...

04:50.805 --> 04:52.797
Valentino...

04:52.973 --> 04:55.759
Cartier... Tiffany...

04:55.933 --> 04:58.221
- Any restaurants?
- Any restaurants? Not a one.

04:58.393 --> 05:00.431
She's alive!

05:00.602 --> 05:04.349
- Oh, Niles!  You're certain!
- Oh, yes!

05:04.521 --> 05:08.731
From that list, she's recreating her infamous 
"Sakes alive, I'm thirty-five" shopping spree!

05:08.898 --> 05:11.684
O.K., Mike, thanks a lot. Yeah, I owe you. Bye.

05:11.858 --> 05:16.150
- Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm so relieved.
- Oh, so am I. I'm exhausted. 

05:16.319 --> 05:18.774
I was so scared.

05:22.739 --> 05:27.399
Frasier? What's wrong?
You look positively uncelebratory.

05:27.575 --> 05:29.947
Aren't you glad Maris is O.K.?

05:30.118 --> 05:34.245
Of course I am.  It's just that...

05:34.413 --> 05:38.622
well, here you are, all panic-stricken and 
scared to death, and she's off on some 
shopping trip!

05:38.790 --> 05:40.829
Don't you find that the least bit upsetting?

05:42.584 --> 05:46.793
Yes, I suppose her behavior was a tad inconsiderate.

05:46.961 --> 05:51.787
- Well, she left without so much
as a note or a phone call!
- Frasier, stay out of this. 
It's between Niles and his wife.

05:51.964 --> 05:54.798
You know, I'm sorry, Dad, but this is not the
first time we've experienced Maris's selfish behavior!

05:54.966 --> 05:58.796
She always puts her needs above his!
She never attends family functions!

05:58.968 --> 06:01.173
Doesn't that make you angry?

06:01.344 --> 06:03.834
Well, over the years I've learned to 
accept Maris's eccentricities.

06:04.012 --> 06:09.170
- Oh, she's not being eccentric.
She's being arrogant and selfish!
- If he says he's not angry, he's not angry.

06:09.348 --> 06:11.803
- And even if I were angry, what would you have me do?
- Let it out!

06:11.975 --> 06:14.761
Well,I am letting it out! I'm getting hives!

06:16.352 --> 06:18.723
Well, that is a triumph of self-expression!

06:18.895 --> 06:22.345
why don't you just let out some of the words that you're dying to say?

06:22.522 --> 06:27.017
Oh God, I am so sick of you and your relentless psychobabble!

06:28.150 --> 06:30.226
A-ha! You're not angry at me! That was directed at Maris!

06:30.402 --> 06:33.816
Nope, that was for you! This is for Maris!

06:33.987 --> 06:36.524
Whoa!  O.K., all right, Niles, now you got it out of your system!

06:36.697 --> 06:39.103
Yes, but it felt so good!  Let me do one more!

06:39.282 --> 06:42.981
All right, Niles, this is good, this is healthy! But you've got to channel it!  You must talk to Maris!

06:43.159 --> 06:47.949
Oh no, wait! That's beautiful! Here, this one's hideous!

06:48.120 --> 06:51.534
- Hey, I gave him that for a wedding present!
- Well, all right, here!

06:53.831 --> 06:58.041
Dios Mio!
Oh, Marta! This feels wonderful! You must try it!

07:03.086 --> 07:05.161
I meant at your house.

07:08.006 --> 07:10.460
- Oh my God, it's Maris!
- Maris?! What?!

07:10.632 --> 07:15.126
- You said she was in New York!
- Well, I don't know, she probably flew back!

07:15.301 --> 07:18.218
All right, all right, no one panic, there's an easy solution to this!

07:18.386 --> 07:20.959
Frasier, bash me on the head with this, we'll tell Maris there was a break-in! 

07:21.138 --> 07:23.213
Niles, Niles, stop it!

07:23.389 --> 07:26.887
- God, you are the damaged party here, not Maris!
- But-but-but-but the mess!

07:27.058 --> 07:31.220
This mess is the physical manifestation of years of repressed anger!

07:31.394 --> 07:35.224
It's time to draw a line in the sand and say,"I have had enough!"

07:35.396 --> 07:38.810
My God, man, show her your mess!

07:45.652 --> 07:49.398
You're right. It's time I told Maris I will not tolerate this behavior.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.143
I'm going up there and I'm going to demand an apology!

07:52.322 --> 07:54.360
Good for you!

07:56.866 --> 07:59.652
I always hated that dynasty.

08:03.328 --> 08:06.078
- How're you feeling, Mr. Crane?
- I'm fine, I wish you'd quit asking me.

08:06.246 --> 08:11.155
Well, it's a reasonable question for a man who just ate a cut of prime rib the size of a hatbox.

08:11.332 --> 08:14.996
Well, whose fault's that?  You're the one who was too embarrassed to walk out with a doggie bag. 

08:15.168 --> 08:19.294
For what it cost, that meat was coming with me, one way or another!

08:21.463 --> 08:25.673
Goodness, we've been gone three hours. Probably have a dog with a full bladder in there.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.295
Lord, let's hope so.

08:34.636 --> 08:36.674
Hey, Daphne, how do you feel about taking him for a walk?

08:36.846 --> 08:41.802
I just want to get in there and unbuckle my pants since I wasn't allowed to at the restaurant!

08:41.974 --> 08:45.424
Oh, sure.  We all know how Eddie needs his exercise.

08:45.601 --> 08:50.308
we wouldn't want all that fatty meat he eats clogging up his aging arteries until his poor old heart gives out.

08:50.479 --> 08:54.806
Oh and, uh, why don't you pick up some half-and-half at the corner store too?

08:55.773 --> 08:58.477
Get moving, old man!

09:03.403 --> 09:05.809
- There y'are!
- Niles?

09:10.115 --> 09:13.612
Sorry to startle you, I let myself in. Want a beer?

09:13.783 --> 09:16.487
No.

09:16.660 --> 09:19.825
I have to thank you for putting me in touch with my anger.

09:19.995 --> 09:25.153
I had no idea how therapeutic it was to just pick something up and smash it!

09:34.587 --> 09:38.713
Well... you're welcome, Niles.  But, um, how did things go with Maris?

09:44.467 --> 09:47.039
I marched into her room and demanded an explanation.

09:47.219 --> 09:50.052
It seems that over lunch with her garden club,

09:50.220 --> 09:53.919
Maris heard that the new Couture lines had arrived in New York.

09:54.097 --> 09:57.180
So she hied her way to the airport, and in her haste she forgot to leave me a note.

09:57.349 --> 10:00.633
- Unbelievable!
- Just thinking about it makes me furious!

10:00.809 --> 10:03.299
- Really?
- Yes!

10:09.689 --> 10:14.065
So I told her, Maris, you were inconsiderate,

10:14.233 --> 10:18.940
and when you are ready to apologize, I can be reached at Frasier's!

10:19.111 --> 10:21.862
Then I stormed out and slammed the door.

10:22.029 --> 10:26.689
Of course, it was that fourteenth-century Bavarian cathedral door, so I had to 
get two of the servants to help me slam it.

10:26.865 --> 10:31.525
But what it lacked in spontaneity it made up for in resonance!

10:32.452 --> 10:36.993
Well, Niles, you know I'm not usually one to toot my own horn, but I think in this case I was on the mark.

10:37.163 --> 10:39.831
- You feel good, don't you?
- I feel great!

10:39.998 --> 10:42.155
- You feel empowered?
- So empowered!

10:42.332 --> 10:46.115
- And you'd like to switch to wine now, wouldn't you?
- Oh, please.

10:50.170 --> 10:52.541
Hello?  Oh, hello, Maris.

10:52.713 --> 10:55.001
Yes, Niles is here.  

11:03.344 --> 11:05.300
Hello, Maris.

11:06.804 --> 11:10.966
Mmm-Hmm. Well, I know you're not used to me speaking to you that way. That's rather the point, wouldn't you agree?

11:12.015 --> 11:13.972
Uh-huh.

11:14.141 --> 11:19.299
I see. Well, thank you. I know this was a very difficult call for you to make. Goodbye.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.977
- It's no use. She still won't talk to me.
- Oh, just give her time to cool off.  

11:37.154 --> 11:39.193
Call her again in the morning.

11:39.364 --> 11:45.731
Geez, you must be exhausted, Niles. Why don't you call it a day and get some rest,huh?

11:45.909 --> 11:50.450
- Do you have a blanket for me?
- Oh now, Niles, you've been going through a rough time lately, you're not sleeping on any couch.

11:50.620 --> 11:52.825
You can sleep in Frasier's bed.

11:55.539 --> 11:57.578
- What?
- You're sure it wouldn't be too much trouble?

11:57.749 --> 12:01.247
No trouble. I wouldn't want to impose.
No, don't worry about it, you're family.

12:01.417 --> 12:03.623
Thank you.

12:07.171 --> 12:09.577
Well, that was very generous of you.

12:09.755 --> 12:14.047
- Well, it's the least you can do after getting him kicked out of the house.
- Well, Dad, I was just trying to do what's right for him.

12:14.216 --> 12:17.299
Well, trust me. I handled domestic disputes for thirty years.

12:17.468 --> 12:19.922
The first rule is, don't take sides.

12:20.094 --> 12:23.592
- Well, it's just a little difficult when it happens to be your own brother.
- Well, that's the second rule.

12:23.763 --> 12:27.012
When it's your own family, keep your nose out of their personal problems.

12:28.724 --> 12:32.590
- This is starting to make some sense.
- Well, maybe you should listen to your old man once in a while.

12:32.768 --> 12:36.301
- I mean, I'm not a psychiatrist or anything, I'm just a cop.
- But a darn good one.

12:36.478 --> 12:41.185
- You're going to talk to Maris, aren't you?
- I'll be back in an hour.

12:49.319 --> 12:53.315
- Don't ignore me, Marta!
- Go away!

12:54.488 --> 12:56.776
Let me in, I need to speak with Mrs. Crane!

12:56.948 --> 13:01.774
Missy Crane say, no you Dr. Crane, no other Dr. Crane,

13:01.951 --> 13:04.108
and no Crane with a cane!

13:05.828 --> 13:11.068
- Well, at least tell her that I'm here!
- She know. Everybody know.

13:13.207 --> 13:16.491
Maris? Maris, we need to talk!

13:16.667 --> 13:20.794
Oh, look, look, I know you're up there, I can see you through the shutters!

13:20.961 --> 13:23.795
All right, if you won't talk, listen!

13:23.963 --> 13:27.745
Niles didn't ask me to come here, I 
came because I care about both of you.

13:27.923 --> 13:31.706
I realize that Niles spoke to 
you rather harshly today.

13:31.884 --> 13:35.631
Truth be told, is it was I that urged him to express his anger.

13:35.803 --> 13:38.886
As hard as it was for you to listen to such criticism,

13:39.055 --> 13:43.430
you're a fair-minded woman and you must concede that he had a right to be upset!

13:45.683 --> 13:51.221
Oh! Oh, Maris! By opening that window you're opening up a window to a long and happy marriage, that's good!

14:03.860 --> 14:08.319
All right, you're expressing your anger! That's good, too!

14:08.488 --> 14:14.108
But, listen, in spite of that last little outburst,I am not going to leave here until we've had some sort of a breakthrough!

14:16.617 --> 14:19.735
Well, I see our time is up, I'll let myself out!

14:22.287 --> 14:24.611
I know you're there. 

14:27.039 --> 14:29.743
After last night, frankly, I've had quite enough of your kind.

14:32.126 --> 14:34.164
You can stare all you like. I'm not going to give you anything to eat.

14:37.295 --> 14:43.331
Oh, all right, here.  You might as well finish off this god-awful Shepherd's Pie that Daphne made.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.838
Lord knows it isn't fit for humans.

14:54.471 --> 14:59.012
Did that sound like "humans?" I said "Mormons."

15:00.224 --> 15:04.137
- You're not at your quickest first thing in the morning, are you?
- Well, it was a rough night.

15:04.310 --> 15:07.345
Well, maybe next time you'll listen to your old man and not come between a husband and his wife.

15:07.520 --> 15:12.310
And here's Dad, all sleep-refreshed and bright-eyed, ready to resume his lecture!

15:13.398 --> 15:16.314
Oh look, your brother left us a note.

15:19.610 --> 15:23.772
Dear Dad, Frasier, & Daphne: when you wake up this morning I'll be gone.

15:23.946 --> 15:28.238
Thank you for all your help, but I don't want to be a burden any longer.

15:28.407 --> 15:33.113
You don't think... no, I'm sure this is all completely harmless.

15:33.284 --> 15:37.114
Yeah, my gun's still locked up...and the door to the balcony's closed...

15:37.286 --> 15:42.623
And we all know that Daphne's Shepherd's Pie is still in the refrigerator.

15:45.499 --> 15:50.918
Hi-ho, everyone! What are you all doing inside on such a beautiful, clear autumn day?

15:51.086 --> 15:53.042
Niles, you seem awfully chipper this morning.

15:53.212 --> 15:56.959
Well, I woke up this morning and I had a realization.Like it or not, my life is changing.

15:57.131 --> 16:00.961
I'm single now, so I went out and rented a bachelor pad. Ooh, is that coffee?

16:01.133 --> 16:04.086
- Don't you think that's jumping the gun a little bit?
- Oh no, Dad.

16:04.260 --> 16:07.425
Maris, uh, ordered me to get my stuff out of there by sundown,

16:07.595 --> 16:11.721
or else she'd turn it over to a church bazaar.

16:11.889 --> 16:15.339
Oh, and I got these jeans!

16:16.808 --> 16:20.010
Right?  Right?  And I'm starting a goatee, and I'm thinking of joining a gym, 

16:20.185 --> 16:24.928
but I don't know whether aerobics or weight training is the quickest route to "buff!"  Any thoughts?

16:31.400 --> 16:34.399
One thought: seek help!

16:35.610 --> 16:39.393
Niles, you've just been through a very traumatic experience here and you are deep in denial here.

16:39.571 --> 16:43.732
You are going through some very extreme emotions right now, and rather than feeling them, you're denying they even exist.

16:43.906 --> 16:48.152
I'm not denying my feelings.  I'm so in tune with my emotions that I was able to move through them quickly.

16:48.326 --> 16:53.365
In fact, I've logged them all in my journal. 

16:53.537 --> 16:59.074
Let's see, where are we? Here...5 AM: Blissful confusion. Something's happened, but what?

17:01.124 --> 17:05.535
5:01: Ah, yes. An overwhelming sense of emptiness and despair.

17:05.710 --> 17:07.951
5:07... this one's hard to read...

17:08.127 --> 17:10.368
oh, right! Wept uncontrollably.

17:10.546 --> 17:13.499
6:15: All cried out.  Hungry now.

17:13.673 --> 17:18.000
Ate entire box of Frosted Flakes, they're gr-r-r-reat!

17:20.969 --> 17:24.300
So don't you tell me I'm not in touch with my emotions!

17:26.305 --> 17:30.004
9:45: get out the butterfly net.

17:34.893 --> 17:39.849
It's not easy for me to say goodbye, especially after so many years all we've shared, all that we've meant to one another.

17:40.021 --> 17:45.226
Jean-Pierre, Marie, Bernard, thank you for your years of devoted service.  

17:45.399 --> 17:48.185
As a personal favor, please look after Mrs. Crane.

17:48.359 --> 17:51.394
It'll be just you and her from now on.

17:53.153 --> 17:57.019
Uh, the staff, they have a question: Can we come with you?

18:00.490 --> 18:02.861
Marta, I'm afraid this is a road I must walk alone.

18:05.868 --> 18:09.651
- Must be very painful, isn't it?
- Painful doesn't begin to describe it.

18:09.829 --> 18:11.951
But they're strong, they'll get over it.

18:12.122 --> 18:14.160
Oh, watch that, careful with those!

18:14.331 --> 18:16.619
Look at him, Dad. My God, he's locked in denial!

18:16.791 --> 18:21.866
Oh, for God's sake. First you get him to move out, then when he does he's not upset enough for you. There's no pleasing you!

18:22.044 --> 18:25.625
Well, what would please me would be to see him actually experience some real emotion!

18:25.796 --> 18:27.835
My God, he's walking through this thing like a zombie!

18:28.006 --> 18:30.081
Well, that's everything. Shall we?

18:30.257 --> 18:32.295
- You know, there's no hurry, Niles.
- Well, actually there is.

18:32.466 --> 18:36.676
I have aerobics at five, and then I'm meeting with my decorator at six-thirty. Off we go!

18:39.053 --> 18:42.053
Have I got my wallet? Yes.

18:43.514 --> 18:45.589
Have I got my checkbook?

18:45.765 --> 18:47.140
Yes.

18:47.308 --> 18:51.932
Have I lost my MIND?! I can't leave! This is my home! You're not taking me!

18:52.102 --> 18:55.351
- Niles, Niles, open the door!
- Nope, nope, bye-bye! Thanks for coming, 

18:55.521 --> 18:57.808
I'll tell Maris you sent your best!

18:57.980 --> 19:01.928
- Now, Niles, calm down.
- No, no, don't calm down! Let it out! This is very healing!

19:02.108 --> 19:05.938
- Don't you ever let up?
- Look, everything's gonna be fine.

19:06.110 --> 19:08.267
No, it isn't. There's no life for me out there!

19:08.444 --> 19:10.851
You're just excited.
I don't want to be a bachelor. I didn't like it the first time.

19:11.029 --> 19:15.606
- Niles, look, just sit down for a second, O.K.?
- Where, Frasier?

19:15.782 --> 19:21.948
Here, in the chair that Maris and I picked out on our honeymoon in Vienna?

19:23.244 --> 19:27.192
Or here, where I sit Sunday mornings playing Mahler 

19:27.372 --> 19:29.696
while Maris dabs at her watercolors?

19:29.873 --> 19:36.407
Perhaps here, where we sipped champagne on our last anniversary.

19:36.585 --> 19:39.454
Guess that really was our last anniversary.

19:39.628 --> 19:41.999
- Oh, Niles...
- Dr. Crane?

19:42.171 --> 19:45.254
- Yes, Marta?
- Missy Crane give me message for you:

19:45.423 --> 19:49.336
if you say is all your fault, you no have to leave.

19:53.636 --> 19:57.383
- ...I can stay?
- She waiting upstairs.

20:00.973 --> 20:04.507
Niles, before you make your decision,

20:04.684 --> 20:08.265
just make sure that you're remembering things the way they really were.

20:08.436 --> 20:11.471
Yes, you bought that chair on your honeymoon in Vienna. But remember,

20:11.646 --> 20:14.646
you wanted to buy the chair that you saw in Paris.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.684
Yes, you sit at the piano every Sunday morning and play Mahler for Maris.

20:17.858 --> 20:21.106
But you hate Mahler!

20:21.276 --> 20:23.647
Besides Maris, who doesn't?!

20:23.819 --> 20:25.858
Look, just give him a little air here...

20:26.029 --> 20:29.859
Look, all I'm saying is that along with the good things in your marriage, there were problems

20:30.031 --> 20:32.402
things you said you couldn't live with anymore.

20:32.574 --> 20:34.613
Now if you want those to change, you have got to stand up to her.

20:34.784 --> 20:39.906
If you back down now, you will go through the rest of your life feeling weak 

20:40.078 --> 20:46.789
and small because you never had the courage to say:I will not let you treat me like this, Lilith! ...Maris!

20:55.212 --> 20:59.622
Well, I've lost all credibility here. Dad, would you please say something?

21:02.966 --> 21:07.258
- I wouldn't mind knowing what you think.
- It doesn't matter what I think..

21:07.427 --> 21:10.213
What matters is what you think.

21:10.387 --> 21:14.217
Now if you want to walk up those stairs, we'll support you. If you want to go out that door, we'll support you there, too.

21:21.476 --> 21:23.931
What are you, nuts?!

21:25.478 --> 21:28.597
You're gonna go up there and grovel to that woman after what she did to you?!

21:30.106 --> 21:34.351
Actually, I was just going to get my car keys.

21:34.525 --> 21:37.608
But thanks for the impartial advice, Dad.

21:38.305 --> 21:44.766
