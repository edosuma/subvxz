WEBVTT

00:01.042 --> 00:03.753
[overlapping yelling]

00:03.795 --> 00:06.631
rock music

00:06.673 --> 00:07.966
Jesus Christ!

00:08.008 --> 00:09.676
Does it look like
I have time to tell you

00:09.718 --> 00:11.845
what happened
on  Shameless  last week?

00:11.886 --> 00:14.055
Yo, back the fuck up!

00:14.097 --> 00:15.974
Back the fuck up,
shit for brains!

00:16.016 --> 00:17.892
God!

00:20.103 --> 00:22.022
[doctor] We treated
Mr. Gallagher three weeks ago

00:22.063 --> 00:24.691
and arrived at a diagnosis
of alcoholic dementia.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.860
It involves
significant impairments

00:26.901 --> 00:29.821
of memory and other
cognitive functions.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.531
We are not selling the house!

00:31.573 --> 00:33.533
We are selling the house,
all right?

00:33.575 --> 00:35.744
Everybody got that?
No more conversations.

00:35.785 --> 00:38.872
No more bullshit--we're
selling the fuckin' house.

00:38.913 --> 00:40.540
[Sarge] Gallagher,
I have reassigned you

00:40.582 --> 00:42.042
to the eviction unit.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.376
Officer Tipping
knows what to do.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.211
Officer Tipping?

00:45.253 --> 00:47.255
Carl.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.715
[grunts]

00:48.757 --> 00:50.717
I am not moving back
to Chicago, okay?

00:50.759 --> 00:52.552
Louisville is my home now.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.220
You can't just decide
a place is your home.

00:54.262 --> 00:55.805
You may be living here
temporarily,

00:55.847 --> 00:57.057
but it won't ever be your home.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.808
Girl, you are so dramatic.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.227
[Frank] Suckers put money
in retirement plans.

01:01.269 --> 01:04.230
Me--
I planned the perfect heist.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.732
What, are you gonna rob a bank?

01:05.774 --> 01:07.692
A bank. Please.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.570
We're gonna rob
the Art Institute.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.739
-Is that--
-No.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.325
[Ian] No way.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.584
rock music

01:28.671 --> 01:31.800
Think of all
the luck you got

01:31.841 --> 01:35.095
Know that
it's not for naught

01:35.136 --> 01:38.139
You were beaming
once before

01:38.181 --> 01:42.435
But it's not like that
anymore

01:42.477 --> 01:45.939
What is this downside

01:45.980 --> 01:49.275
That you speak of?

01:49.317 --> 01:51.277
What is this feeling

01:51.319 --> 01:56.116
You're so sure of?

02:02.789 --> 02:06.626
Round up
the friends you got

02:06.668 --> 02:09.462
Know that
they're not for naught

02:09.504 --> 02:12.549
You were willing
once before

02:12.590 --> 02:17.053
But it's not like that
anymore

02:17.095 --> 02:20.223
What is this downside

02:20.265 --> 02:23.601
That you speak of?

02:23.643 --> 02:25.770
What is this feeling

02:25.812 --> 02:29.899
You're so sure of?

02:30.525 --> 02:33.486
Good morning, Chicago.
A new dawn breaks

02:33.528 --> 02:35.697
on the citywide hunt
for "Nighthawks,"

02:35.738 --> 02:38.283
Edward Hopper's
most famous painting,

02:38.324 --> 02:40.201
stolen from the Art Institute.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.162
Despite the museum's

02:42.203 --> 02:43.496
state-of-the-art
security system,

02:43.538 --> 02:44.998
the thief left no trace.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.000
A-are we sure
this is the real one?

02:47.041 --> 02:49.502
Be a hell of a coincidence.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.838
[Mickey] I don't get it.
Two guys and a girl,

02:51.880 --> 02:53.965
like, buying coffee--
what's the big deal?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.633
[Ian] It's supposed to be
romantic.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.635
I guess I kind of see it.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.137
What? They look miserable,

02:59.179 --> 03:00.680
but at least
they're miserable together.

03:00.722 --> 03:01.931
[Liam] I think
it's rudimentary.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.850
Three people at a diner?

03:03.892 --> 03:05.518
Give me some paper.
I'll draw it.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.312
[Ian] Yeah, I kind of
doubt that, Picasso.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.522
It's just another
mediocre artist

03:09.564 --> 03:11.482
who's only famous
because he's white.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.526
All right, look, well,
we got to get rid of it, right?

03:13.568 --> 03:16.321
I mean, if the cops find it
here, we're all doin' time.

03:16.362 --> 03:17.697
[Mickey] Uh, yo, coffee?

03:17.739 --> 03:19.365
Yeah, top of the washer.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.492
Hi. When are you gonna
fix the hot water?

03:21.534 --> 03:23.161
I froze my tits off
in the shower this morning.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.371
Got the gas company comin'
sometime today.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.624
Hey, or you can get
your tools out

03:27.665 --> 03:28.875
-and you can fix it.
-No, thanks.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.169
Not helping you sell
the house we grew up in.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.795
Jesus Christ, Debs, this again?

03:32.837 --> 03:34.339
[Debbie] Yes, this again.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.840
I was supposed to
be working today,

03:35.882 --> 03:37.717
making money to feed my child,

03:37.759 --> 03:39.385
but instead,
Franny and I have to go look

03:39.427 --> 03:40.762
for a new place to live,
hopefully somewhere

03:40.803 --> 03:42.096
with no lead paint

03:42.138 --> 03:43.556
-or mass shootings.
-[Lip moans]

03:43.598 --> 03:45.391
Hey, Debs, you still
covering the afternoon shift?

03:45.433 --> 03:46.559
Yeah.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.102
-What shift?
-[Ian] The Alibi.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.605
Kev and V are in Louisville
helping V's mom settle in,

03:50.647 --> 03:52.106
so Mick and I are opening.

03:52.148 --> 03:53.900
No, no.
No one's going anywhere

03:53.942 --> 03:55.276
until we get rid of this thing,
all right?

03:55.318 --> 03:56.653
It's not my problem now,

03:56.694 --> 03:58.196
now that you're the one
making decisions.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.948
Come on, Franny.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.952
We could burn it.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.954
Burn a piece of art history
worth, what,

04:05.995 --> 04:08.373
-millions of dollars?
-Wait--millions?

04:08.414 --> 04:11.000
Shit. That's a section 668
federal offense.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.211
That's a major artwork?
Ten years, each.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.088
[Mickey] I know a guy who moved
some dinosaur bones

04:15.129 --> 04:16.923
that fell off a field museum
truck a few years back.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.675
Want me to see
if he can find a buyer?

04:18.716 --> 04:20.593
No, there's not a fence in
the world that can move this.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.929
I mean, it'd be like
tryin' to sell the "Mona Lisa."

04:22.971 --> 04:24.931
Let's just put it in an alley
by the Art Institute,

04:24.973 --> 04:26.349
call in a tip.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.101
[Lip] Frank's prints
are gonna be all over it.

04:28.142 --> 04:31.104
I mean, how do you get prints
off canvas--carpet cleaner?

04:31.145 --> 04:32.981
Do we even have carpet cleaner?

04:34.399 --> 04:36.192
Holy shit.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.696
Is that the original?

04:39.737 --> 04:41.656
How the hell did it get here?

04:41.698 --> 04:43.116
Good question, Frank.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.118
Did Jelly--

04:45.159 --> 04:46.911
They fucked me.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.788
-[Carl] You stole it.
-[Frank] It was Tease.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.499
Wasn't it? What'd he say?
Why did he bring it here?

04:51.541 --> 04:53.584
Tease is dead.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.336
-What?
-[Liam] You told me yesterday.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.464
Y-you don't remember
anything about this, right?

04:58.506 --> 04:59.966
[Frank] Um...

05:00.008 --> 05:01.801
Why would he lie?

05:01.843 --> 05:04.095
'Cause he's Frank.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.180
The doctor said there would
be good days and bad.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.349
-What doctor?
-Or he's a lying sack of shit

05:08.391 --> 05:11.060
who never takes responsibility
for any of the crap he does.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.770
[Frank] You can't talk to me
like that.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.106
-I'm still your father.
-He can't help it, Ian.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.233
Don't talk about me
like I'm not here.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.570
-I know a guy--
-[Lip] What are you doing?

05:20.611 --> 05:22.280
-I know a guy--
-[Lip] Frank, Frank, Frank--

05:22.322 --> 05:23.906
-I know a guy--
-[Lip] Put it down, sit down.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.784
[Carl]
You don't know a guy.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.328
[Frank sighs]

05:28.369 --> 05:29.954
[Lip] Okay.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.831
-What are we gonna do?
-He's gonna say we should

05:31.873 --> 05:33.291
hand it over to the po-po.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.667
Hell, no, they'll kick me
off the force

05:34.709 --> 05:36.085
and lock the rest of you up.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.920
Just give me the day.
I'll scope things out.

05:37.962 --> 05:39.297
[Lip] Well, somebody's
got to watch Frank.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.007
[Mickey] We can't.
We're openin' the Alibi.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.675
-[Ian] Take him with us.
-You can't take him

05:42.717 --> 05:44.677
to the Alibi--he'll tell
everybody he stole it.

05:44.719 --> 05:45.845
-Then we're all fucked.
-I'm not gonna tell people

05:45.887 --> 05:47.305
I stole it.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.350
Look, we got to keep him close,
all right? Liam?

05:50.391 --> 05:52.018
I got an errand.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.895
Yeah, well, I got to deal
with the remodel,

05:53.936 --> 05:55.355
I got the gas company guy
comin',

05:55.396 --> 05:57.148
and I got to watch Fred--
I can't deal with Frank.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.483
Cuff him to the radiator.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.110
-Fuck off.
-Gas company guy might think

06:01.152 --> 06:03.196
-that's a little weird, no?
-[Ian] Just lock him

06:03.237 --> 06:04.614
in the basement--
it's what he used to do to us.

06:04.655 --> 06:08.076
I mean, he left me there
for three days when I was six.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.745
-[sighs]
-I'll take him.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.164
Frank, you want
to run an errand?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.916
What kind of an errand?

06:14.957 --> 06:17.627
Just come on.
Don't forget your jacket.

06:17.668 --> 06:18.920
[door opens]

06:18.961 --> 06:20.588
We got to go too, Red.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.799
-[door closes]
-[sighs] Catch you later.

06:22.840 --> 06:26.302
Sorry. Keep it safe
till tonight.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.179
[door opens]

06:28.221 --> 06:30.556
-Great. Thank you!
-[door closes]

06:30.598 --> 06:33.559
[door opens, closes]

06:33.601 --> 06:35.478
upbeat music

06:35.520 --> 06:37.563
[Carol] Hey.
You know that?

06:37.605 --> 06:40.650
I think that
I'll have my morning coffee

06:40.691 --> 06:43.361
right there, al fresco.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.864
And then my afternoon bourbon
in the backyard,

06:46.906 --> 06:48.491
also al fresco.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.159
Oh, you know, maybe I'll get
one of those,

06:50.201 --> 06:53.246
um, firepits that Bear's
been goin' on about.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.831
Aunty Bev and cousin Constance
comin' today?

06:54.872 --> 06:56.541
Mm-hmm.

06:56.582 --> 06:59.710
And Sherm and your Uncle Tyler
and cousin Keisha.

06:59.752 --> 07:00.962
-[Veronica] Oh.
-I didn't know you had

07:01.003 --> 07:03.464
-so much family out here.
-Yeah, Bev was the first

07:03.506 --> 07:04.715
one of us to move to
Louisville,

07:04.757 --> 07:06.050
then everybody else
just followed.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.344
You know what?
You guys should move down here.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.596
It's like the great migration,
but in reverse.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.141
I mean, everybody's movin' back
below the Mason-Dixon Line.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.892
It's cheaper and cleaner

07:14.934 --> 07:16.894
and no gang warfare.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.688
-Mom...
-V, look,

07:18.729 --> 07:20.440
there's
a two-bedroom town house

07:20.481 --> 07:21.941
on the other side
of that cul-de-sac.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.609
It's still available.

07:23.651 --> 07:26.237
And they have great public
schools nearby for the girls.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.030
-We are not moving here, Mom.
-Why?

07:28.072 --> 07:30.032
You got somethin'
against clean air?

07:30.074 --> 07:31.784
Huh? Or bein' around family

07:31.826 --> 07:33.703
or that green-ass lawn?

07:33.744 --> 07:35.788
I guess that's terrible,
too, huh?

07:35.830 --> 07:37.874
The lawn is nice.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.585
But it's just,
i-it's the South.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.379
[gasps] You know what?
I just had a thought.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.591
I should get a hammock
for the backyard.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.050
-What do you think?
-Well, let us get it for you

07:48.092 --> 07:49.427
as a housewarming gift.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.596
Oh, no, you guys
don't have to do that.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.307
Just having you here is
present enough.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.808
Every home needs
a housewarming gift.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.101
Please, let us.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.228
"Let us," which means me.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.189
Okay. I can pick one up
on the way

08:01.230 --> 08:03.149
to the Louisville Slugger
bat factory today.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.651
Hey, is there a Waffle House
around here somewhere?

08:05.693 --> 08:07.945
-Waffle House?
-We don't have one in Chicago,

08:07.987 --> 08:09.697
and I love those pecan waffles.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.032
Kevin, do not fill up
on waffles.

08:11.073 --> 08:13.159
We're havin' a barbecue
this afternoon.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.785
But I'm hungry.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.746
-[Carol] You'll live.
-The Louisville what tour?

08:16.787 --> 08:17.997
[Kevin] Bat factory.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.624
I've always wanted to go.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.292
I might even get a bat
with my name on it.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.252
With your name?
A bat?

08:23.294 --> 08:24.629
All the major leaguers do it.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.922
You don't even like baseball.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.632
I love baseball!

08:27.673 --> 08:29.342
Take me out

08:29.383 --> 08:30.510
- To the ballgame--
-Since you're going anyway,

08:30.551 --> 08:32.428
would you mind, uh,

08:32.470 --> 08:34.764
picking up a few other things
for me?

08:34.805 --> 08:36.849
Yeah. I can pick up
a couple things.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.351
Now, you gonna need
to take the U-Haul.

08:38.392 --> 08:40.186
The list is pretty long.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.440
-Happy to help.
-[exhales sharply] Thank you.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.859
-[Carol] This is so great!
-[mouthing] Sorry.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.361
[Tipping]  I'm surprised
the captain didn't assign us

08:48.402 --> 08:49.862
the "Nighthawks."

08:49.904 --> 08:51.864
Half the force is out
lookin' for that painting.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.491
-Ever seen it?
-No.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.618
-Not that I can remember.
-I did once.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.161
Field trip
in the seventh grade.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.330
Who do you think did it?
The Russians?

08:59.372 --> 09:01.791
So they can hang it in Putin's
secret billion-dollar palace

09:01.832 --> 09:03.834
-just to screw with us?
-The Russians?

09:03.876 --> 09:06.295
A heist like that takes
finesse, planning.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.381
Russians are great
at that sneaky stuff--

09:08.422 --> 09:11.342
stealing nuclear secrets,
elections.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.427
Probably just some old man
who wandered into the museum,

09:13.469 --> 09:15.179
saw something he liked,
and took it.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.473
An old man?
I doubt it.

09:17.515 --> 09:20.268
Well, what would the punishment
be for someone like that

09:20.309 --> 09:21.769
if they turn themselves in?

09:21.811 --> 09:24.730
Is the old man white and rich
or Black or poor?

09:24.772 --> 09:26.607
If he's rich, he'll buy himself
a fancy lawyer

09:26.649 --> 09:28.192
and get off with time served.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.736
If he's poor, accidently shot
during the arrest.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.989
Poor people always get screwed.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.824
Can I ask you something?

09:34.865 --> 09:37.660
-What?
-Did you steal that painting?

09:37.702 --> 09:39.662
Well, apparently.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.248
There's security cameras,
alarms, guards.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.041
How did you do it?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.878
According to the news,
they don't know who took it

09:47.920 --> 09:49.547
or how or when.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.090
Ha!

09:51.132 --> 09:53.634
Iko, baby.
[chuckles]

10:01.058 --> 10:02.435
Dad?

10:02.476 --> 10:04.478
No, that's you.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.607
Oh, God.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.944
When did I get so old?

10:11.986 --> 10:15.114
-Where are we going?
-[Liam] Give me your arm.

10:15.156 --> 10:18.784
I'm writing Lip's number down
in case we get separated.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.995
I need your help
with this kid Wen Chung,

10:21.037 --> 10:23.122
see if I can get him to fail
his math test on Monday.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.624
Why?

10:24.665 --> 10:26.792
The STEM charter middle school
I want to go to

10:26.834 --> 10:30.004
automatically accepts
the first kids in each class.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.965
Everyone else has to compete
for the few remaining spots.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.842
I'm number two.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.971
What's your leverage?

10:39.013 --> 10:40.681
Thinkin'
I'll play the Black card.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.350
Then the poor card.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.602
Then maybe even
the dead-mom card.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.604
You could tell him
you're gay, too.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.856
Ooh. That's a good idea.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.025
The gay card's always a winner.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.818
Whatever it takes.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.988
But you can't let China
steal your future.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.282
This is still America, right?

10:58.324 --> 10:59.575
Are you asking?

10:59.617 --> 11:02.161
Greatest country on Earth.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.913
Right.

11:03.954 --> 11:06.123
No little Chinese
communist bastard

11:06.165 --> 11:08.459
can ever take that away
from you,

11:08.501 --> 11:11.170
no matter how many Covid flus
they send our way,

11:11.212 --> 11:12.922
try to kill us.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.636
[door opens]

11:18.678 --> 11:19.970
[Lip] Hey, hey.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.681
[Tami] Ho-ho.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.349
Holy shit.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.850
-Yeah.
-What, a tornado

11:24.892 --> 11:26.686
-blow through here?
-No, I was up half the night

11:26.727 --> 11:27.978
tearin' shit out.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.146
-[whispers] Hi, buddy.
-[door closes]

11:29.188 --> 11:30.523
Hey.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.149
-You, uh, you want coffee?
-Yes.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.694
-Yeah?
-Yes, thanks.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.071
[sighs]

11:40.199 --> 11:41.367
-Oh...
-There you go.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.661
Thank you.

11:43.703 --> 11:47.373
So how much longer is, uh,
this gonna take?

11:47.415 --> 11:49.500
Well, I should be done with
the kitchen in a couple days,

11:49.542 --> 11:51.919
then we can put it
on the market.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.380
[Tami] Good, 'cause I have to
get out of my dad's place.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.549
Cory's latest breakup
is ugly.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.551
Oh, yeah?

11:58.592 --> 11:59.885
She was on the phone
yelling at him

11:59.927 --> 12:02.680
for three hours last night.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.306
[groans]

12:04.348 --> 12:06.058
Hmm.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.729
Hey, you wanted us
to move into your dad's.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.021
You still wish I'd said yes?

12:11.063 --> 12:14.024
[chuckles] Okay, don't be
a smug asshole.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.902
Did you call about those
mechanic applications?

12:16.944 --> 12:19.196
Uh, I got to follow up.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.656
Today?

12:20.698 --> 12:23.743
Look, none a the jobs
I applied for

12:23.784 --> 12:25.244
are gonna pay anything close

12:25.286 --> 12:26.996
to what we make if we
sell the house, all right?

12:27.037 --> 12:28.330
It's a better use a my time.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.916
Well, how about do both?

12:30.958 --> 12:33.544
You know, you could follow up
on the applications

12:33.586 --> 12:36.464
and  finish the house, huh?

12:36.505 --> 12:38.090
Yeah, okay.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.050
Okay.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.928
-Good.
-[both] Mwah.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.263
Uh, I've got
a couple more boxes

12:44.305 --> 12:45.598
to load up over at Milton's.

12:45.639 --> 12:46.766
I'll meet you over there later
to finish?

12:46.807 --> 12:47.975
-Yeah, yeah, sounds good.
-All right.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.060
-See you.
-Bye.

12:57.276 --> 13:01.614
What do you say
we stash this underground, huh?

13:01.655 --> 13:03.657
Yeah, I think so, too.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.040
One part vodka...

13:11.081 --> 13:13.125
two parts orange juice.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.960
Where's the OJ?

13:15.002 --> 13:17.421
I don't get why people
like fancy drinks.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.298
Why would I pay more
to get drunk slower?

13:19.340 --> 13:21.133
I really should pay Teddy
a visit.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.469
-Who?
-Dinosaur bone guy.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.095
I mean, I know Lip
doesn't think we can sell

13:25.137 --> 13:27.097
the thing Frank got,
but he doesn't know Teddy.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.141
We can make, like, a mil,
give or take.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.060
Buy some land
down on the Gulf of Mexico,

13:31.101 --> 13:32.645
live like fuckin' kings--
come on.

13:32.686 --> 13:33.896
We'll get money
from sellin' the house.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.648
How much we gonna
get from that?

13:35.689 --> 13:37.316
$20, $25?

13:37.358 --> 13:39.819
[Tommy whistles]
If I had that kind of money,

13:39.860 --> 13:41.654
I'd buy a boat,
load it up with Jaeger,

13:41.695 --> 13:43.823
take it out on the lake,
and see you fuckers never.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.950
Oh, I'd get a waterbed.
I've always wanted one.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.660
They're great for your back.

13:47.701 --> 13:49.495
We need to expand the business,
get another ambulance,

13:49.537 --> 13:51.664
hire a couple guys.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.333
Yeah, right, we need some AKs,
couple ARs, bazooka.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.126
Why do you need a bazooka?

13:56.168 --> 13:58.295
'Cause it's fun
to blow shit up, Kermit.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.132
[Ian] We need to get
an apartment first,

14:02.174 --> 14:03.884
see how much money
we have left after rent.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.135
All right, how much is rent?

14:05.177 --> 14:07.888
Don't know. Let's see.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.640
It's got to be
a ground-floor apartment.

14:09.682 --> 14:13.435
I don't want to walk up and
down stairs with my bazooka.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.521
[person]
Lunch special.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.314
[rock music in background]

14:17.356 --> 14:19.483
[person] Opening day
under new ownership.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.819
-[sighs]
-[person] Lunch special.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.195
Lunch special.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.155
What the hell's a Dutch oven?

14:25.197 --> 14:27.283
-Lunch special.
-Oh, thanks.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.370
Fully loaded burger
for two ninety-nine?

14:31.412 --> 14:34.164
New price. Opening day
under new ownership.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.333
Wow. I got to hit
the Slugger factory,

14:36.375 --> 14:38.168
but what the hell,
a man's got to eat, right?

14:38.210 --> 14:39.211
Yeah.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.380
[panting]

14:41.422 --> 14:43.966
You all right in there, dude?

14:44.008 --> 14:46.051
[grunts, breathing heavily]

14:46.093 --> 14:48.220
This thing weighs a ton.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.389
-Where you from?
-South Side, Chicago.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.266
Down here visiting
my mother-in-law.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.727
[person]
Ah. How you like it so far?

14:54.768 --> 14:56.770
I don't know.
It's kind of weird.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.022
It's like two cities,
you know?

14:58.063 --> 15:00.024
The only thing I see
in this part a town

15:00.065 --> 15:01.609
are old white women
with big hair

15:01.650 --> 15:03.360
and Christians
with cross tattoos.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.863
I know what you mean.
I think they only hired me

15:05.905 --> 15:07.781
'cause I'm brown enough
to be part of the patty.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.950
That's fuckin' racist!

15:09.992 --> 15:12.161
Or is it?
I mean...

15:12.202 --> 15:14.121
I mean, well,
you did get the job,

15:14.163 --> 15:16.332
so maybe it's--I don't know--

15:16.373 --> 15:18.334
good racism?

15:18.375 --> 15:22.171
[rock music continues]

15:22.212 --> 15:23.839
-It's right over there.
-Right, cool.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.424
Thanks, man.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.726
[Debbie] Hello!

15:35.768 --> 15:39.021
We're here for the open house?

15:39.063 --> 15:42.858
Okay. You ready to see
the apartment, Franny?

15:42.900 --> 15:44.026
This could be our new home.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.945
Can Uncle Ian live with us?

15:45.986 --> 15:47.571
I like him the best.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.032
Ha. Me too.
But, no, Franny.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.951
This is just for you and I.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.662
We'll do our hair,

15:54.703 --> 15:56.747
and we'll paint our nails,
and...

15:56.789 --> 15:58.499
we could make pancakes.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.585
Then, uh, pffft, uh, we'll--

16:01.627 --> 16:04.421
Play liquor store robbery
with Uncle Mickey?

16:04.463 --> 16:06.632
[huffs]

16:06.674 --> 16:08.092
[door opens]

16:08.133 --> 16:11.470
Is this my room, Mommy?

16:11.512 --> 16:13.138
Oh, no, Fran.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.599
We'll use that as like
a-a guestroom or something.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.351
You and I will share
the other bedroom together.

16:19.728 --> 16:22.648
moody music

16:25.651 --> 16:30.614
All by myself

16:32.032 --> 16:33.742
Don't want to be

16:33.784 --> 16:38.455
All by myself

16:38.497 --> 16:41.750
Anymore

16:41.792 --> 16:44.461
All right, Fran.
Time to go.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.307
[Liam] He's not home.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.309
His mom says he's either
at chess club

16:59.351 --> 17:01.270
or on his way
to music class.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.522
-Who?
-Wen.

17:03.564 --> 17:06.692
Roll up your sleeve.

17:06.734 --> 17:11.030
[Frank] Oh, uh... the kid
who stole your girlfriend.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.781
My spot at STEM school.

17:12.823 --> 17:16.243
I was doing better than him
during Zoom classes,

17:16.285 --> 17:19.038
but the teachers decided to
give everyone A's for hardship.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.123
All that hard work
for nothing.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.666
[Frank] Well, exactly.
That's what I've been

17:22.708 --> 17:24.877
trying to teach you
your whole life.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.837
Hard work is a waste a time.

17:26.879 --> 17:29.048
What does Wen Chung
know about hardship?

17:29.089 --> 17:30.632
He plays the bassoon.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.760
Asians are always
stealing opportunities

17:32.801 --> 17:34.887
away from African Americans.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.056
Don't you think
that's kind of racist?

17:37.097 --> 17:39.850
Wen just happens to be
a Asian dude who's smart.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.187
Did you ever meet
a Black software engineer?

17:43.228 --> 17:44.688
Huh?

17:44.730 --> 17:47.232
No. Asians? Dime a dozen.

17:47.274 --> 17:50.903
The communists have a monopoly
on Affirmative Action.

17:50.944 --> 17:54.406
You got to fight the power.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.034
-[handle clattering]
-I think our best chance

17:57.076 --> 18:00.913
is gonna be a classic
kidnap/intimidate maneuver.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.915
-What's that?
-That's a surefire way

18:02.956 --> 18:05.459
of gettin' what you want
without spilling blood,

18:05.501 --> 18:07.544
assuming
you don't want to spill blood.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.338
I just want to talk, negotiate.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.048
[Frank] Nah, screw that.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.008
You want results,
you're gonna have to work him.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.177
Ah, here we go.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.596
-Come on.
-What are you doing?

18:17.638 --> 18:19.681
It's hard to pull off
a kidnapping scheme

18:19.723 --> 18:21.058
without a van.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.601
Come on, get in.

18:22.643 --> 18:26.563
upbeat rock music

18:26.605 --> 18:28.273
-[laughter]
-[Carol] All right, ladies.

18:28.315 --> 18:31.527
-Thanks, Mama.
-[Constance] Thank you, Aunty.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.070
[Carol] Here you go,
sweet pea. Bev?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.613
[Bev] Ooh, just water for me.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.532
That liquor does not mix well
with my amoxicillin.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.033
[Constance] Oh, Mama!

18:38.075 --> 18:40.119
-[laughing] Shh!
-I know you not tryin'

18:40.160 --> 18:41.912
to tell me to stay quiet.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.914
I have nothin' to be
embarrassed about.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.415
-[Constance] Okay.
-I had a little fun

18:45.457 --> 18:47.292
with a nice young man
and got chlamydia.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.044
-[Constance groans]
-Or maybe it was

18:49.086 --> 18:50.963
a lovely older gentleman--
I don't know who gave it to me.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.214
[Veronica] Okay.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.757
Oh, my God, my ears,
they on fire.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.259
-[laughter]
-[Bev] There comes a time

18:55.300 --> 18:56.969
in every woman's life

18:57.010 --> 18:59.555
when she stops carin'
about what other people think

18:59.596 --> 19:02.391
and starts focusing
on what makes her happy.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.476
And I'd say
that's about age...

19:04.518 --> 19:06.228
-60.
-60. Mm-hmm.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.105
Or when your husband dies.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.566
-Or after your first divorce.
-Oh, well, in that case,

19:10.607 --> 19:12.693
the ink on my papers
are almost dry, so I cannot

19:12.734 --> 19:15.487
-wait for that moment.
-[Veronica] I'll drink to that.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.322
-[laughter]
-[Constance] Cousin, what's up

19:17.364 --> 19:18.532
with you and Kev?

19:18.574 --> 19:20.325
Girl, I don't know
how you do it.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.077
I gave up white boys
decades ago.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.912
Oh, my baby used to that.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.497
She only got white friends
in Chicago.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.291
That is not true!

19:27.332 --> 19:29.877
I-I-I have Black friends.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.628
Who?

19:31.670 --> 19:34.173
There aren't many Black folks
on the South Side anymore.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.549
They all movin' away,

19:35.591 --> 19:37.551
bein' pushed out by
gentrifyin' white folks.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.970
Mm, yeah.
Same thing happened in Harlem.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.555
-Pittsburgh, too.
-[Constance] Mm-hmm.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.765
How do you think we all
ended up back down here?

19:43.807 --> 19:45.893
Just move down, V.
Be with your own people.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.269
Well, I'm trying to get
Black folks

19:47.311 --> 19:48.979
to move back to the South Side.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.355
Not gonna happen.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.858
White folks move in,
they take over.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.694
They are an invasive species,
like kudzu.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.196
-[Constance, laughing] Kudzu.
-[Veronica laughing]

19:57.237 --> 19:59.865
Listen, you need to get out
before them little twins

19:59.907 --> 20:02.034
bring home white boyfriends
named, uh,

20:02.075 --> 20:03.869
Mason or Dash.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.871
[Carol] Sis, you right.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.123
Well, plus, your Aunt Bev
swears by the dick down here.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.459
You know, in case you want to
get a whole jump

20:10.500 --> 20:12.169
on that
"makin' yourself happy" thing.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.338
[Carol] Bev, you got
to hook a sister up, girl.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.631
-[line trills]
-[person]  Hello?

20:15.672 --> 20:17.716
Yeah, this is, uh,
Phillip Gallagher.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.343
I was, uh, callin'
'cause I applied

20:19.384 --> 20:21.386
for the mechanic job last week.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.847
Uh, I was wanting to see if the
job has been filled, and I--

20:23.889 --> 20:26.225
[person]
Position's been filled.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.602
Oh. Uh...

20:28.644 --> 20:30.604
All right, well, thanks.
Bye.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.190
[person]
Yep. Bye.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.692
What is that?
Number three?

20:35.734 --> 20:38.070
That's a great use
of our time, huh, bud?

20:38.111 --> 20:39.738
[phone beeps]

20:39.780 --> 20:41.198
[line trills]

20:41.240 --> 20:42.741
[Ricky]  Bubba's Kawasaki.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.410
Yeah, hi, this is, uh,
Phillip Gallagher.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.579
I applied for the mechanic job.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.748
I was just, uh--I was wondering
if you hired someone.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.917
We did, but I might have
another opening.

20:51.959 --> 20:55.254
One a my guys peed hot,
blew his parole.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.089
Oh, really?

20:57.130 --> 20:58.340
Yeah, what's your name?
Gallagher?

20:58.382 --> 21:00.259
Yeah. Phillip Gallagher.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.428
[knocking on door]

21:03.470 --> 21:05.264
Gallagher.
Yeah, you worked at BornFree?

21:05.305 --> 21:07.057
Heard they got sold.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.934
Uh, yeah, yeah, you know,
they, uh--

21:08.976 --> 21:10.560
they let most a the guys go.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.104
I think they're using
the space now.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.523
They're rentin' it out
to a CrossFit or somethin'.

21:14.564 --> 21:16.024
[quietly] Hey, man,
thanks for comin'.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.192
Yeah...
[continues indistinctly]

21:17.234 --> 21:18.944
They take over
everywhere they go.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.696
[technician] Checked the meter.
It looks good.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.948
Know where that furnace is at?

21:22.990 --> 21:25.075
[Lip] Yeah, yeah,
it's just, um...

21:25.117 --> 21:27.035
just down in the basement
right over there.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.454
[both]
Yeah, yeah.

21:29.496 --> 21:30.956
All right, yeah, the gig's
40 hours a week.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.457
15 an hour.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.418
I could start you
on the 6:00 a.m. shift.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.420
15 an hour, huh?

21:36.461 --> 21:38.463
There, uh, benefits, or...

21:38.505 --> 21:40.799
No benefits,
but every couple weeks

21:40.841 --> 21:42.467
we do a pizza night
for the guys.

21:42.509 --> 21:45.345
Oh, that's, uh...

21:45.387 --> 21:48.223
Shit, you know what?
Uh, can I put you on hold?

21:51.685 --> 21:53.645
[door closes]

21:59.359 --> 22:01.278
That's a pretty good copy, man.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.655
You hear somebody stole
the original out the museum?

22:03.697 --> 22:06.241
-No way.
-Yeah, craziest story.

22:06.283 --> 22:08.327
Well, my grandma
loved this painting.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.746
She had this, uh, copy up in
her bedroom till she died.

22:10.787 --> 22:13.999
I never liked it that much.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.792
Want to sell it?

22:15.834 --> 22:17.753
My mom would love it.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.672
Birthday's comin' up.

22:20.714 --> 22:23.842
Ah, yeah, I don't--
I don't know, um...

22:23.884 --> 22:25.761
Give you a hundred.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.141
Nah, I shouldn't, you know?
Sentimental value.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.518
-Mm.
-Dead granny, yeah.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.770
Where's that furnace?

22:34.811 --> 22:36.938
-Just back there.
-Okay.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.359
Hey, let me know
if you need anything.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.235
Okay.

22:53.580 --> 22:56.083
[sighs]

23:01.963 --> 23:04.049
[number dialing]

23:04.091 --> 23:05.550
[line trilling]

23:05.592 --> 23:07.135
[Ricky]  You've reached
Bubba's Kawasaki,

23:07.177 --> 23:09.304
best bike shop
west of the lake.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.847
We're in Maywood
off the 171.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.391
Leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.

23:12.432 --> 23:13.850
[beep]

23:13.892 --> 23:16.895
[sirens wailing
in the distance]

23:24.111 --> 23:27.364
rock music

23:31.076 --> 23:32.744
Hey, what about this one?

23:32.786 --> 23:33.912
Close to freeway,
so quick escape.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.372
It's got a big backyard.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.581
We could get a couple pit bulls
in there.

23:36.623 --> 23:38.417
And a basement
to store guns and stuff.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.001
Is it a home or a safe house?

23:40.043 --> 23:42.087
-[clattering]
-Same shit. Hey.

23:42.129 --> 23:43.755
Hey, ten bucks.

23:43.797 --> 23:45.590
Since when?

23:45.632 --> 23:47.092
Since Kev and V
put us in charge.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.760
You want to keep bitchin' about
it, it's gonna be 15.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.762
Well, how about this one?
It's got a heated pool,

23:50.804 --> 23:53.890
gym, garden--I always
wanted to grow tomatoes.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.143
That's the gayest shit
I ever heard.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.811
Hey, a pool would be dope,
though.

23:57.853 --> 24:00.188
I'd love an underwater blowie.
How much?

24:00.230 --> 24:01.565
900 bucks.

24:01.606 --> 24:04.276
It's cheap.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.778
Maybe it's a scam?

24:06.820 --> 24:08.822
You know, a lot of those
luxury condos

24:08.864 --> 24:11.658
that went up before
the pandemic are empty.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.452
It's a good time to rent.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.620
Ah, this won't work.
It's on the West Side.

24:15.662 --> 24:17.581
Let me see it.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.458
See? Other side of the river?

24:19.499 --> 24:21.543
-Oh, fuck.
-Too good to be true, I guess.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.086
Do tomatoes grow on a bush?

24:23.128 --> 24:24.754
On a vine.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.590
Then a bunch of tomatoes
are a vineyard, then.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.800
Fuckin'--hey, we should
go check this out anyway.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.635
I don't want to move
to the West Side.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.053
No, me neither.
I just want to see

24:32.095 --> 24:33.597
what a West Side
heated pool looks like.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.140
-[siren wailing]
-[person] I understand, lady.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.933
Calm down, please.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.811
[people chanting]
Solution, not eviction.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.397
-Solution, not eviction.
-Let's get the non-lethals.

24:42.439 --> 24:43.648
We might have to beanbag

24:43.690 --> 24:45.400
some of these bitches
to hold 'em back.

24:45.442 --> 24:46.735
[person] Ladies,
we're handling it.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.570
[protestors clamoring]

24:48.612 --> 24:50.322
It's just a bunch
of old ladies.

24:50.363 --> 24:51.865
[Tipping] They may look
peaceful now,

24:51.907 --> 24:54.284
but they're one protest song
and a presidential dog whistle

24:54.326 --> 24:55.869
away from turning into
a deadly mob.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.412
-I really don't think that--
-Good.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.749
Don't think. Our personal
safety is my primary concern.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.751
I don't want to,
but if it comes down

25:02.792 --> 25:04.628
to a choice between my noggin

25:04.669 --> 25:06.671
and some old Antifa lady's
blue-haired brain bucket,

25:06.713 --> 25:09.508
I'm bustin' heads.

25:09.549 --> 25:11.968
It's hats and bats time, Carl.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.929
Solution, not eviction!

25:13.970 --> 25:17.807
Back up, ladies.
This is an unlawful assembly.

25:17.849 --> 25:20.727
You wouldn't be the first nuns
I put in handcuffs.

25:20.769 --> 25:23.146
Apologies for that wait.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.439
Our bartender came down
with something

25:24.481 --> 25:25.649
and had to go home.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.526
We been rotatin' servers
behind the bar,

25:27.567 --> 25:29.152
and they're way behind.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.779
Oh, heck.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.031
Doreen's knockin' back
more than she's servin'.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.991
[sighs] Gonna have to put her
back on the floor,

25:35.033 --> 25:36.701
take over.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.453
Day like this,
she could walk away

25:38.495 --> 25:39.996
with 200 bucks cash in tips

25:40.038 --> 25:43.291
-just workin' lunch.
-Um...200?

25:43.333 --> 25:44.793
Mm.

25:44.834 --> 25:48.672
[mellow rock over speakers]

25:48.713 --> 25:51.216
I could jump back there
for a bit if you need.

25:51.258 --> 25:53.218
I got years of experience
bartending.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.637
-I own my own bar in Chicago.
-Oh, man, that'd be terrific.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.472
So I get to keep
the tips, right?

25:57.514 --> 25:58.807
Oh, yeah, yeah, come on.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.647
[Debbie] Mm.

26:05.689 --> 26:08.024
They're all so empty.

26:08.066 --> 26:11.278
At our new house, can we have
White Castle all the time?

26:11.319 --> 26:14.823
Sure, Franny.
We'll see.

26:14.864 --> 26:17.284
[person] Be careful.
It's the last toy you've got.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.996
[Franny] Can I go play?

26:21.037 --> 26:23.123
Sure.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.382
[sighs] Got to bring it
everywhere.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.551
His Captain America
got stolen at the shelter.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.511
Still cries about it.

26:38.638 --> 26:40.265
How'd you two end up here?

26:40.307 --> 26:42.100
On the streets?

26:42.142 --> 26:44.185
Family threw us out.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.229
Your family?

26:46.271 --> 26:48.440
I think it was the drugs,
really.

26:48.481 --> 26:51.026
By the time I got clean,
they'd all moved.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.986
Wouldn't tell me where.

26:54.404 --> 26:55.905
Assholes.

26:55.947 --> 26:57.741
Yeah.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.452
Families are shit.

27:00.493 --> 27:03.038
They tell you they love you,

27:03.079 --> 27:05.582
but when you need 'em,
they're not around.

27:05.624 --> 27:09.169
All by myself

27:09.210 --> 27:11.296
Don't want to be...

27:11.338 --> 27:12.631
What are you doin'?

27:12.672 --> 27:14.299
Looking for cops.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.259
Ah, he doesn't do that anymore.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.428
-Who?
-The--

27:18.470 --> 27:21.222
the bartender
with the Black girlfriend.

27:21.264 --> 27:22.515
-Kevin?
-Yeah.

27:22.557 --> 27:24.768
Sold a lot of pot
out of this thing.

27:24.809 --> 27:26.478
This is a delivery truck.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.776
[Frank] Oh, shit.

27:32.817 --> 27:35.236
How long have I been
a delivery driver?

27:35.278 --> 27:38.782
No, we took it.
You said we needed a vehicle

27:38.823 --> 27:41.159
so we could kidnap a kid
I need to talk to.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.577
Who are we kidnapping?

27:42.619 --> 27:44.996
-Wen.
-Now.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.831
No, that's the kid's name.

27:46.873 --> 27:50.168
-Wen.
-Ah.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.795
-We gonna beat him up?
-No.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.838
I just need to ask him
for a favor.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.840
We wrote it on your arm. See?

27:59.803 --> 28:02.097
Right.

28:02.138 --> 28:04.724
-Is he big?
-No.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.310
We can throw him in the river,
make it look accidental.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.437
This is way above my pay grade.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.485
[technician]
Water heater's fine.

28:15.527 --> 28:19.114
Just need a new
pilot light igniter.

28:19.155 --> 28:21.741
But I'm not gonna be able
to turn your gas back on.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.660
-Why? Why's that?
-Well, you got

28:23.702 --> 28:26.579
several leaks downstairs,
you got one up here.

28:26.621 --> 28:29.499
Your pipes are ancient--you're
gonna have to replace 'em.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.543
[Lip] Well, how much
is that gonna cost?

28:31.584 --> 28:34.421
You have to get an estimate
from a plumber, but...

28:34.462 --> 28:36.089
probably a couple of grand.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.799
Shit, look, man, I'm, uh--

28:37.841 --> 28:39.384
I'm tryin' to
sell this place, right?

28:39.426 --> 28:41.594
Don't you think you can just,
like, patch 'em up somehow,

28:41.636 --> 28:43.513
and then the new owners,
they can deal with it.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.057
Sorry. Don't want you
blowin' up the block.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.976
Let us know when the work
is done.

28:48.017 --> 28:49.978
We'll come back,
turn your gas on.

28:52.522 --> 28:55.525
[door opens, closes]

28:55.567 --> 28:57.736
[sighs]

28:57.777 --> 28:59.070
You got a couple grand
layin' around?

29:01.030 --> 29:02.824
Yeah, me neither.

29:04.534 --> 29:07.078
[phone ringing]

29:07.120 --> 29:08.496
-Hey.
-[Debbie]  Hey.

29:08.538 --> 29:11.082
-Let's get a place together.
-Wha...huh?

29:11.124 --> 29:12.709
Just because
we're selling the house

29:12.751 --> 29:14.419
doesn't mean we can't
still live together--

29:14.461 --> 29:16.045
you, me, Mickey, Franny, Liam.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.714
Let Lip do what he wants.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.758
Yeah. I don't think
that's gonna fly with Mickey.

29:19.799 --> 29:22.343
Also, Liam's gonna live
with Lip and Tami.

29:22.385 --> 29:23.845
What are Franny and I
supposed to do?

29:23.887 --> 29:25.513
I don't know how to live
by myself.

29:25.555 --> 29:26.890
I've never been alone
a day in my life.

29:26.931 --> 29:29.517
[Ian]  I don't know.
Get some roommates.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.561
-Where are you?
-Why?

29:31.603 --> 29:33.438
'Cause you were supposed to
be here 40 minutes ago.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.856
Mickey and I are late
to a thing.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.691
Yeah, well,
I'm looking for housing

29:36.733 --> 29:38.526
for me and my soon-to-be
homeless daughter.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.195
I'll get there
when I get there.

29:40.236 --> 29:41.404
Debs, are y--

29:43.907 --> 29:45.867
-She's running late.
-Yeah, no shit.

29:45.909 --> 29:47.619
We're supposed to meet
the rental lady in 30 minutes.

29:47.660 --> 29:50.205
-We should cancel.
-What? Fuck that.

29:50.246 --> 29:52.207
You know what?
Tommy, get behind the bar.

29:52.248 --> 29:54.083
-What?
-You're in charge

29:54.125 --> 29:56.294
till we get back.
You get two free beers.

29:56.336 --> 29:59.088
Nobody else gets free shit,
especially fuckin' Kermit.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.715
Let's go for a swim.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.967
I don't think they're gonna
let us swim.

30:03.009 --> 30:05.470
Okay, ladies, round three.

30:05.512 --> 30:09.140
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you talked us into round three.

30:09.182 --> 30:10.934
You're bad.

30:10.975 --> 30:12.602
You're really bad.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.729
You guys are nurses.
You're heroes.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.397
You deserve round three
and many more.

30:16.439 --> 30:19.609
[mellow music over speakers]

30:21.611 --> 30:24.322
Mmm. So yummy.
What do you call this again?

30:24.364 --> 30:27.283
Oreo mojito.
It's my own creation.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.327
It won Cocktail of the Year
in Vegas.

30:29.369 --> 30:34.123
Wow. So you're like
a real cocktail sommelier.

30:34.165 --> 30:37.669
Tell us, Kev,
are you single?

30:37.710 --> 30:40.171
[phone buzzes]

30:40.213 --> 30:41.798
One sec.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.675
-Hey!
-[Veronica]  Kev, when are you

30:43.716 --> 30:45.844
getting here?
People are askin' about you.

30:45.885 --> 30:48.847
Uh, sorry, babe, I got caught
up with Carol's errands,

30:48.888 --> 30:50.223
-and then I got hungry--
-I don't need

30:50.265 --> 30:52.016
a play-by-play.
Just get here.

30:52.058 --> 30:54.477
Okay.
I'll see you in a bit.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.855
[quietly]
I love you.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.690
[protestors chanting]
Solution, not eviction.

30:58.731 --> 31:00.817
Solution, not eviction.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.861
[Carl]
This is fucked up.

31:02.902 --> 31:05.947
[protestors chanting]
Solution, not eviction!

31:05.989 --> 31:08.032
[Carl] Hey, who's that?

31:08.074 --> 31:09.993
The landlord--I've seen him
at a few of these before.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.494
He's the guy
who called this in.

31:11.536 --> 31:13.830
[protestor]
How do you sleep at night?

31:13.872 --> 31:17.292
-[clamoring]
-[officer] Hey, hey!

31:17.333 --> 31:18.710
[protestor]
We're not going anywhere.

31:18.751 --> 31:20.128
[officer]
You hit me with that bag again,

31:20.169 --> 31:21.504
-I'm gonna arrest you.
-[knocks on window]

31:21.546 --> 31:23.840
Some asshole cop
knockin' at my window.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.217
[stammers, sighs]

31:26.259 --> 31:28.469
Yeah. Hold on a second.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.054
[protestors]
Solution, not eviction!

31:30.096 --> 31:32.849
-Can I help you?
-You can't park here, sir.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.727
-That's my house right there.
-You got to move your car.

31:35.768 --> 31:37.562
-You're double-parked.
-Carl, what are you doing?

31:37.604 --> 31:39.939
And I also noticed you're on
the phone while driving.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.900
-That's a traffic violation.
-I'm gonna call you back.

31:41.941 --> 31:43.610
-Hey, is this kid serious?
-Need you just step out

31:43.651 --> 31:45.069
-of the vehicle, sir?
-[chuckling]

31:45.111 --> 31:46.404
-What?
-I said...

31:46.446 --> 31:48.615
-Whoa!
-Step out of the vehicle.

31:48.656 --> 31:49.908
Get off of me, man!

31:49.949 --> 31:51.910
What the hell you think
you're doin'?

31:51.951 --> 31:53.536
I'm arresting you for
assaulting a police officer.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.747
-Class D felony!
-Assault?

31:55.788 --> 31:58.499
If anyone's assaulting anyone,
it's you assaulting me.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.877
Gallagher, we don't arrest
people that drive Mercedes.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.129
-Do you know who I am?
-I don't care, sir.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.882
-I'm calling my alderman!
-You people think you can

32:05.924 --> 32:07.592
just come down here
to the South Side,

32:07.634 --> 32:10.094
park wherever you want,
kick out our neighbors,

32:10.136 --> 32:12.013
arrest old men just 'cause
they have dementia?

32:12.055 --> 32:13.932
I have the mayor's
cell phone number.

32:13.973 --> 32:16.267
I don't care if you have
LeBron on speed-dial.

32:16.309 --> 32:17.936
You're going to jail.

32:17.977 --> 32:20.605
You and your fancy S-class
and shiny shoes

32:20.647 --> 32:22.774
are what's wrong
with this world.

32:22.815 --> 32:25.026
-You're goin' down!
-Ah!

32:30.239 --> 32:33.326
Huh? Well, fuck that!

32:38.957 --> 32:40.750
Give Liam what he needs,

32:40.792 --> 32:42.627
and this doesn't
have to get ugly.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.253
-Frank, stop!
-You know this guy?

32:44.295 --> 32:46.297
-He's my dad.
-You watch your mouth,

32:46.339 --> 32:48.132
fat guy,
or I will fuck you up.

32:48.174 --> 32:49.676
I don't care how little
you are.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.344
Give that back!

32:51.386 --> 32:53.513
No, wait, Liam.
Wait a second!

32:53.554 --> 32:56.808
Liam--Jesus!

32:56.849 --> 32:59.852
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. A-are you okay?

33:01.604 --> 33:04.399
[Liam] I'm sorry.
My bad. He has dementia.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.401
The deal's off--
I'm taking the test on Monday,

33:06.442 --> 33:08.152
and I'm acing it.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.821
Why would you do that?

33:09.862 --> 33:11.447
We were doing good cop,
bad cop.

33:11.489 --> 33:12.991
No, we weren't!

33:13.032 --> 33:14.826
I was making a deal with him,
and you ruined it!

33:19.622 --> 33:22.667
-Ah-ah-ah...
-[laughter]

33:22.709 --> 33:24.752
[Constance] Cousin,
where you get them moves?

33:24.794 --> 33:25.962
[Carol] She got 'em
from her mama.

33:26.004 --> 33:26.963
It's true, I did.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.256
[laughter]

33:28.297 --> 33:29.841
Oh, baby, come here, come here.

33:29.882 --> 33:31.676
This is Millie.

33:31.718 --> 33:34.262
Millie lives on the other side
of that empty condo.

33:34.303 --> 33:36.514
V, y'all could be neighbors.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.307
It's nice to meet you,
Ms. Millie.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.435
Millie, this is my daughter
Veronica.

33:40.476 --> 33:42.770
She's an entrepreneur
and a political organizer

33:42.812 --> 33:44.022
back up in Chicago.

33:44.063 --> 33:45.773
I'm not really
a political organizer.

33:45.815 --> 33:47.734
Political organizer!

33:47.775 --> 33:50.361
Do you know the Obamas?

33:50.403 --> 33:52.864
I...I do.

33:52.905 --> 33:55.158
Shelley and I were in
a runners' club together.

33:55.199 --> 33:57.326
You have to meet
my son Douglas.

33:57.368 --> 33:58.995
He wants to run for Congress.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.497
He could use an experienced
political organizer

34:01.539 --> 34:03.833
who knows the Obamas
on his campaign.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.586
-Campaign, for Congress?
-Mm-hmm.

34:12.925 --> 34:15.261
[garbage disposal humming]

34:15.303 --> 34:16.721
[Mickey]
Ha ha ha ha!

34:16.763 --> 34:19.182
Yo, that pool is sick!

34:19.223 --> 34:20.892
-Garbage disposal.
-[click, motor hums]

Ooh!

34:30.109 --> 34:31.527
-Right?
-Come on, let's go.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.404
Wait. One more thing.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.406
You got to feel this bed.

34:35.448 --> 34:37.033
-All right.
-All right.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.994
Just check out this bed, baby.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.996
Ahh.

34:42.038 --> 34:43.873
Ahh. It's like sleeping
on a cloud.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.084
Oh. Yeah.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.794
Yeah, that's nice.

34:50.963 --> 34:52.799
I think we should do this.

34:55.134 --> 34:57.887
Do what?

34:57.929 --> 34:59.639
Rent this place.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.307
Wait--what?

35:01.349 --> 35:03.226
Well, it's nice, it's cheap,

35:03.267 --> 35:05.228
you love the pool, and the
lady at the leasing office

35:05.269 --> 35:07.105
said if we sign
in the next 30 minutes,

35:07.146 --> 35:08.815
we get the first month
rent-free.

35:08.856 --> 35:11.734
-It's on the fuckin' West Side.
-I-it's only 15 minutes away.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.736
-Just a few miles.
-No. We don't know

35:13.778 --> 35:15.696
the escape routes, t-the
bail bondsmen around here--

35:15.738 --> 35:18.783
So we stop doing shady shit
and grow some tomatoes.

35:18.825 --> 35:21.410
Can we just talk to the lady?
Take a look at the lease?

35:21.452 --> 35:22.912
I don't want to look
at the fuckin' lease.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.831
I'm not movin' here.

35:24.872 --> 35:26.541
Was this your plan
the whole time?

35:26.582 --> 35:28.793
No, of course not.
But the place is nice.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.711
Can you just think about it?

35:30.753 --> 35:33.756
All I wanted
was to go for a swim.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.049
Mickey.

35:37.927 --> 35:39.637
Hey. Uh, I'm Debbie.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.597
I-I called about the room
you're rentin' out.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.142
Ah, yes, Debbie.
Very nice to meet you.

35:44.183 --> 35:45.810
And who is this lovely
little lady?

35:45.852 --> 35:47.270
This is my daughter Franny.

35:47.311 --> 35:48.813
Hi, Franny.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.940
You want to go over
and play with Fabiola

35:50.982 --> 35:52.108
while I show your mama
the room?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.777
Okay.

35:54.819 --> 35:58.531
[landlady chuckling]

35:58.573 --> 36:00.533
I'm Beatrice.
Uh, these are my sons,

36:00.575 --> 36:02.160
Junior, Daniel,

36:02.201 --> 36:04.996
my daughter Tamara.

36:05.037 --> 36:07.165
Oh, oh!
[giggling]

36:07.206 --> 36:08.499
Some of the little ones
are mine.

36:08.541 --> 36:10.084
Others are grandchildren.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.627
You come from a big family,
Debbie?

36:11.669 --> 36:13.838
-I do.
-And you don't live together?

36:13.880 --> 36:15.882
We recently lost our house.

36:15.923 --> 36:17.258
[Beatrice]
Oh, that's sad to hear.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.010
Was it the virus that got you?

36:19.051 --> 36:20.803
-Somethin' like that.
-Mm.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.597
-Do you guys all live here?
-[Beatrice] Mostly.

36:22.638 --> 36:24.223
Some come and go.

36:24.265 --> 36:25.808
Your room is up over
the garage.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.060
Used to belong
to my mother-in-law.

36:28.102 --> 36:30.188
I thought I was living
in the house.

36:30.229 --> 36:32.648
No, on the other end
of the backyard.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.109
It's very private.
You'd hardly ever see us.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.861
Like your own little sanctuary.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.863
Well, would we share
the backyard?

36:38.905 --> 36:40.865
Mm, no, we all never
go out back.

36:40.907 --> 36:43.534
When my mother-in-law pass on,

36:43.576 --> 36:45.703
it took us almost a week
to realize she died.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.205
We forgot she was back there.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.789
[laughing]

36:48.831 --> 36:53.711
All by myself

36:55.171 --> 36:57.048
Ha ha ha.
Don't worry, though.

36:57.089 --> 36:59.550
-We cleaned it up.
-Well, I was wondering

36:59.592 --> 37:01.093
if there's maybe a room
in the house

37:01.135 --> 37:02.803
that I could live in?

37:02.845 --> 37:04.680
Maybe one of your kids want
to switch with Franny and I.

37:04.722 --> 37:07.391
They could take the garage,
and we could take their room?

37:07.433 --> 37:09.477
I don't think
that would work.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.229
Well...

37:11.270 --> 37:14.148
Franny's only ever lived
in a house full of chaos,

37:14.190 --> 37:16.192
so it could be traumatizing
for her to lose that.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.110
Uh...that's my son's room.

37:18.152 --> 37:19.612
[Debbie] Well, uh...

37:19.654 --> 37:20.988
Cool! What about this room?

37:21.030 --> 37:22.698
That's the kids' room.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.700
There's three kids
in there already.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.535
Well, Franny and I
could take the fourth bed.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.037
We don't need much space.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.122
I wouldn't feel comfortable.

37:30.164 --> 37:32.291
We'll totally chip in
with utilities.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.919
I could cook, clean.
I'll watch the kids.

37:34.961 --> 37:38.047
We just prefer to keep
the family together.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.966
I'm sure you understand.

37:49.141 --> 37:50.393
-[doorbell chimes]
-[Mickey] Hey.

37:50.434 --> 37:51.519
Where are your beers?

37:51.560 --> 37:53.437
[clerk]
What are you lookin' for?

37:53.479 --> 37:55.690
IPAs, porters, sours,
hefeweizens?

37:55.731 --> 37:57.566
American.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.235
To the right.

38:00.736 --> 38:03.948
Jesus Christ!

38:03.990 --> 38:06.867
[mellow music in background]

38:29.473 --> 38:31.350
How much for this?

38:31.392 --> 38:32.685
[clerk] Four bucks.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.937
[Mickey] For the can?

38:34.979 --> 38:38.399
Should be, like, three bucks
a fuckin' six-pack, man.

38:38.441 --> 38:41.944
What kind of West Side bullshit
is this, asshole?

38:44.155 --> 38:46.824
Got to sell a kidney
just to afford a beer.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.580
-Four-dollar can, my ass.
-[door closes]

38:52.621 --> 38:54.081
-On your left!
-Oof--

38:54.123 --> 38:56.459
-[Mickey] Jesus, Fuck!
-I said on your left!

38:56.500 --> 38:58.711
It's confusing!
My left or yours?

38:58.753 --> 38:59.920
On your right!

38:59.962 --> 39:02.131
Jesus Chr--

39:02.173 --> 39:04.925
Why the fuck
is everybody runnin'?

39:04.967 --> 39:07.261
No one's chasing you fuckers.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.555
upbeat music

39:09.597 --> 39:11.432
West Side bullshit.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.603
[door opens]

39:15.644 --> 39:17.063
Hey.

39:17.104 --> 39:19.857
There's my big boy.

39:19.899 --> 39:23.527
[gasps] Hi. Hey.
How was your day?

39:23.569 --> 39:25.863
Ah, it was pretty shitty.

39:27.907 --> 39:31.035
Well, I was asking Fred, but...

39:31.077 --> 39:33.037
Why shitty?

39:33.079 --> 39:35.289
Well, the gas is still off.

39:35.331 --> 39:38.334
Apparently the pipes are old,
and the whole place could blow,

39:38.376 --> 39:41.087
so it's gonna cost
a couple grand to fix it

39:41.128 --> 39:43.130
before I can sell the place.

39:43.172 --> 39:45.925
Well, can your siblings
pitch in?

39:45.966 --> 39:47.718
I doubt it.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.595
They haven't lifted
a hammer to help yet.

39:52.306 --> 39:54.141
Did you follow up
on those jobs?

39:54.183 --> 39:56.811
Yeah. Um, they didn't
have anything.

39:56.852 --> 39:59.021
Shit.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.564
[knock on door]

40:00.606 --> 40:02.817
-Who's that?
-No clue.

40:06.445 --> 40:08.906
So sorry.
Is now a bad time?

40:08.948 --> 40:10.741
-We know we're a day early.
-We were just, uh,

40:10.783 --> 40:12.827
hoping to check out
some paint samples.

40:12.868 --> 40:13.994
[Tami] Oh.

40:14.036 --> 40:16.747
New owners.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.335
Uh, yeah, sure.
Come in. We're just...

40:21.377 --> 40:23.254
loading up the last boxes.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.924
-[Lip] Hey, how's it going?
-[door closes]

40:26.966 --> 40:29.927
[Maggie] You must be sad
to say good-bye to this place.

40:29.969 --> 40:31.595
[Tye] Uh, dude, we really
liked that fixture

40:31.637 --> 40:33.597
in the walkthrough--
I don't know that you can

40:33.639 --> 40:35.099
-just take it.
-Uh, this one's mine,

40:35.141 --> 40:36.600
but you can talk to Milton.

40:36.642 --> 40:38.436
He's got one in a box
in the garage.

40:40.646 --> 40:42.106
Saw that sweet Indian
out in the garage.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.399
That your ride?

40:43.441 --> 40:45.109
[Lip]
Yeah. I've been fixin' it up.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.611
-I always wanted one.
-Oh, yeah?

40:47.653 --> 40:49.947
For the weekends.

40:49.989 --> 40:51.490
Well, it's for sale.

40:51.532 --> 40:53.117
-[Tye] No way.
-[Lip] Yeah.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.452
[Tye] How much?

40:54.493 --> 40:55.744
[Lip] 15 grand.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.206
Or, um...

40:59.248 --> 41:00.916
I-I don't know.
Wh-what were you thinking?

41:00.958 --> 41:03.294
I don't know...eight?

41:03.335 --> 41:05.212
[Tami] Eight?

41:05.254 --> 41:08.549
Well, I don't know, maybe
I could do, uh, 12?

41:08.591 --> 41:11.802
I can go, like, nine.
That's all I got.

41:13.345 --> 41:15.306
[Tami, softly] No.

41:15.347 --> 41:17.808
Does that even cover
what you put in? No.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.935
[Lip] Yeah.
Yeah, no, it's good, it's, uh--

41:19.977 --> 41:23.105
Okay, we can do, um...
we can do nine.

41:23.147 --> 41:26.150
-You got a deal.
-[both chuckle]

41:26.192 --> 41:27.902
[Lip] You want to come take
another look?

41:27.943 --> 41:29.570
-[Tye] Yeah.
-[Lip] Yeah, let's go.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.825
[motorcycle engine
turning over]

41:39.371 --> 41:42.291
[Tami] So how much
did you have in it?

41:42.333 --> 41:45.294
Seven in parts,
plus my labor

41:45.336 --> 41:47.338
means I made about, uh...

41:47.379 --> 41:49.423
two bucks an hour.

41:55.387 --> 41:57.515
You okay?

42:00.226 --> 42:02.811
Yeah, it's nine grand.

42:03.938 --> 42:06.524
Liam, hey.

42:06.565 --> 42:09.527
Man!
You missed it.

42:09.568 --> 42:12.863
Some delivery van got stolen
over on Cermak,

42:12.905 --> 42:16.033
and the cops
were all over the place.

42:16.075 --> 42:18.202
[chuckling]

42:22.081 --> 42:24.208
I don't know how to do this.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.961
-Do what?
-Take care of you.

42:27.002 --> 42:29.213
You're supposed to
take care of me.

42:29.255 --> 42:31.882
You don't have to
take care of me. I'm fine.

42:31.924 --> 42:33.717
No, you're not.

42:33.759 --> 42:36.136
You have dementia.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.891
[Frank, giggling]
What are you doing?

42:45.938 --> 42:47.731
[sighs]

42:47.773 --> 42:49.233
That bad?

42:54.780 --> 42:57.783
Bad like old Mr. Ionescu?

42:57.825 --> 42:59.118
Wandering around
in his bathrobe

42:59.159 --> 43:00.995
with his dick hanging out?

43:01.036 --> 43:02.746
Not yet.

43:02.788 --> 43:06.959
Ionescu got his dick caught
in a tree in Lincoln Park.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.211
They think he was
trying to fuck it.

43:11.130 --> 43:13.674
Ended up freezing to death.

43:13.716 --> 43:15.593
Had to cut him out.

43:18.095 --> 43:20.055
Have you all talked
about what to do with me

43:20.097 --> 43:21.515
when it gets bad?

43:21.557 --> 43:24.059
No. But it'll probably
be up to me

43:24.101 --> 43:25.477
to figure it out.

43:28.063 --> 43:30.733
That's a lot
for a nine-year-old kid.

43:30.774 --> 43:32.443
[sighs] Who else
is gonna do it?

43:32.484 --> 43:35.237
They all hate you.

43:35.279 --> 43:36.614
Right.

43:40.951 --> 43:42.119
I'm 11.

43:44.997 --> 43:48.000
It's Friday night,
and my head is spinnin'

43:50.461 --> 43:52.004
There was a bar
full of whiskey

43:52.046 --> 43:53.964
-[door opens]
- And a room full of women

43:57.009 --> 44:00.721
I got to get out,
but got no place to go

44:02.681 --> 44:05.851
Maybe we'll drive south
to Mexico

44:07.686 --> 44:09.563
Here is your tip.

44:09.605 --> 44:12.775
Here's a little somethin'
on top.

44:12.816 --> 44:14.943
Your drink killed out there!

44:14.985 --> 44:16.695
Yeah, the trick is
to load it up with Oreos.

44:16.737 --> 44:18.280
You got to cram 'em in.

44:18.322 --> 44:20.324
Makes the drink so sweet
you hardly need any liquor.

44:20.366 --> 44:21.742
The sugar does all the work
for you.

44:21.784 --> 44:23.369
[scoffs]

44:23.410 --> 44:24.828
Well, if you stick around,

44:24.870 --> 44:27.915
know that there is a job
for you here at Fry-Yay's.

44:29.208 --> 44:30.501
-Really?
-Ha ha.

44:30.542 --> 44:32.419
Absolutely.

44:32.461 --> 44:36.465
[mellow rock in background]

44:40.552 --> 44:42.930
Holy fuckin' shit!

44:47.726 --> 44:50.521
Hey, Franny, you missed a spot
on the bottom there.

44:50.562 --> 44:52.856
[Kermit]
Oh, leave the kid alone.

44:52.898 --> 44:55.609
Yeah, enough. Here's a free
beer for you, Kermit.

44:55.651 --> 44:58.028
Can't believe Ian left
you two in charge of the bar.

44:58.070 --> 45:01.240
I'm surprised there's a bar
left to be in charge of.

45:01.281 --> 45:02.908
They went to look
for an apartment.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.702
Traitors. They don't care
what's gonna happen

45:04.743 --> 45:06.120
to Franny and me.

45:06.161 --> 45:08.580
We're gonna end up homeless
on the street

45:08.622 --> 45:10.666
or dead on the floor
of an empty apartment.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.459
That's why I never moved out.

45:12.501 --> 45:14.461
I don't know what I'm gonna
do when Mom dies.

45:14.503 --> 45:16.130
Stop taking baths with her,
for one.

45:16.171 --> 45:18.340
That was one time.

45:18.382 --> 45:20.426
Can't believe I told you that.

45:20.467 --> 45:23.178
You know what, Debs? You and
Franny can move in with me

45:23.220 --> 45:25.222
if you want--
I got an extra room.

45:25.264 --> 45:27.266
My place has been empty
since the divorce, and sad.

45:27.307 --> 45:29.810
That's why I'm here
all the time.

45:29.852 --> 45:31.895
Thanks, Tommy.

45:31.937 --> 45:34.773
But I think I'd rather live
under the El tracks.

45:38.277 --> 45:40.738
[Ian] Where the hell'd you go?

45:42.614 --> 45:44.074
Signed the lease.

45:44.116 --> 45:46.201
-You did what?
-It'll be good for us, Mick.

45:46.243 --> 45:48.579
We can start a life here.

45:48.620 --> 45:52.416
Without your family
or my family--just us.

45:52.458 --> 45:54.001
You know I grew up

45:54.042 --> 45:56.086
dreamin' about being
king of the South Side?

45:56.128 --> 45:59.214
Makin' deals, shootin' people,
not being married to some fag

45:59.256 --> 46:00.966
who wants to sleep
on a cloud bed

46:01.008 --> 46:02.342
on the fuckin' West Side.

46:02.384 --> 46:04.762
-It is a nice bed.
-And what's so bad about

46:04.803 --> 46:06.430
-bein' from the South Side?
-Nothing.

46:08.223 --> 46:11.101
We'll always be from
the South Side, but...

46:11.143 --> 46:13.353
now we have a heated pool.

46:13.395 --> 46:15.439
Fuckin' great.

46:17.483 --> 46:19.568
[Ian] Well, good.

46:23.363 --> 46:25.616
You know we're farther south
right now than at our house?

46:25.657 --> 46:27.451
-Bullshit.
-No, it's true.

46:27.493 --> 46:28.952
'Cause of the river.

46:28.994 --> 46:31.955
Chicago makes no fuckin' sense.

46:33.874 --> 46:35.918
Whatever.

46:35.959 --> 46:39.755
rock music

46:51.767 --> 46:53.310
Handcuff keys, Gallagher.

46:58.357 --> 47:01.902
[Sarge sighs]

47:01.944 --> 47:04.029
Sorry about that.

47:04.071 --> 47:05.989
Yeah. I got your badge numbers.

47:06.031 --> 47:08.325
You know, sir, kid's a rookie.
They don't always know.

47:08.367 --> 47:11.161
-I'm callin' my attorney.
-[Sarge sighs]

47:11.203 --> 47:13.664
You didn't tell him
about the Mercedes rule?

47:13.705 --> 47:15.123
I told him.

47:15.165 --> 47:16.834
What the hell, Gallagher?

47:16.875 --> 47:19.086
We don't arrest rich people
in nice cars.

47:19.127 --> 47:20.587
He broke the law, Sarge.

47:20.629 --> 47:22.798
Cut the "defender of the weak"
shit.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.092
It is not our job
to police the rich.

47:25.133 --> 47:27.177
Their contributions
paid for our new gym

47:27.219 --> 47:28.971
and the snacks
in our break room.

47:29.012 --> 47:30.848
We're here to serve
and protect the rich,

47:30.889 --> 47:32.516
not arrest them.

47:32.558 --> 47:34.643
Who's protecting the people
he threw out on the street?

47:34.685 --> 47:36.270
They didn't pay rent,
so they got evicted.

47:36.311 --> 47:37.646
Then they said, "Screw it,
I'm staying anyway,

47:37.688 --> 47:39.189
even though it's not my house."

47:39.231 --> 47:41.483
-But don't you just--
-We let them get away with it,

47:41.525 --> 47:43.110
next thing you know,
nobody's paying rent,

47:43.151 --> 47:44.903
the economy collapses,
and we wake up one morning

47:44.945 --> 47:46.613
living in
post-apocalyptic ruins

47:46.655 --> 47:48.991
eating old cans
of dog food.

47:49.032 --> 47:52.286
The point is, poor people
need to follow the law.

47:52.327 --> 47:55.289
We get paid to enforce it.

47:55.330 --> 47:58.208
You can't wear blue
if you don't get that.

48:00.419 --> 48:02.045
[scoffs]

48:04.256 --> 48:06.008
-So I'm fired?
-I doubt it.

48:06.049 --> 48:07.843
It's almost impossible
to get fired from the force.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.803
You got to have ten or 12
excessive force complaints

48:09.845 --> 48:12.389
before they even open
an investigation.

48:12.431 --> 48:15.350
rock music

48:17.269 --> 48:19.396
[protestor]
What are we gonna do now?

48:19.438 --> 48:21.064
Where are we gonna live?

48:21.106 --> 48:22.566
[protester 2]
Where do I go?

48:22.608 --> 48:24.943
Let me have two bags.

48:24.985 --> 48:27.738
-Throw in some works, will you?
-[distant siren wailing]

48:32.242 --> 48:34.745
Keep your status quo

48:34.786 --> 48:37.706
Our lives aren't your show

48:37.748 --> 48:39.750
Gonna be who we are

48:39.791 --> 48:41.960
Where's that Sharpie?

48:43.253 --> 48:45.547
We break the system

48:45.589 --> 48:46.715
Who was that?

48:46.757 --> 48:49.134
It occurs to me...

48:49.176 --> 48:52.930
I've made more enemies
than friends.

48:52.971 --> 48:55.015
[Liam] Sounds accurate.

48:55.057 --> 48:56.850
Thanks.

48:56.892 --> 48:59.019
I got to make one more stop.

48:59.061 --> 49:02.147
I'll stick with you,
if that's okay.

49:02.189 --> 49:03.190
Sure.

49:05.901 --> 49:07.819
I break the system

49:11.823 --> 49:14.242
I break the system

49:14.284 --> 49:16.286
-Want to make dinner together?
-No. I want to shower.

49:16.328 --> 49:18.372
[Lip] Hot water's still out.

49:18.413 --> 49:20.916
Fuck you been doin' all day,
sittin' around jackin' off?

49:20.958 --> 49:22.668
[Ian] Ignore him.
He's just bitchy

49:22.709 --> 49:24.252
because we rented a place
on the West Side.

49:24.294 --> 49:25.462
No, look, it's his fuckin'
fault we got to move

49:25.504 --> 49:26.463
in the first place.

49:26.505 --> 49:27.714
What's goin' on?

49:27.756 --> 49:29.508
W-wait.
You found an apartment?

49:29.549 --> 49:32.594
Yeah. It's got a pool
and a garden.

49:32.636 --> 49:34.179
You're moving out already?

49:34.221 --> 49:36.264
Signed the lease
and everything.

49:39.351 --> 49:41.019
-[clattering]
-[Lip] Shit!

49:47.109 --> 49:49.695
You pick that up?

49:49.736 --> 49:52.781
They're right there.

49:52.823 --> 49:55.117
Jesus Christ.
Hand me the pliers, Mickey.

49:55.158 --> 49:56.535
Get it yourself, bitch.

49:56.576 --> 49:58.286
What the fuck's your problem?

49:58.328 --> 50:00.288
You are my fuckin' problem.

50:00.330 --> 50:01.957
If you weren't all
Mr. Fuckin' Fix It,

50:01.999 --> 50:04.001
I wouldn't be movin'
to the goddamn West Side.

50:04.042 --> 50:06.003
Pick it up.

50:06.044 --> 50:08.839
Or what?

50:08.880 --> 50:11.008
Get the fuck out of my face.

50:11.049 --> 50:13.010
The fuck are you gonna do?

50:13.051 --> 50:14.886
-[Mickey] Motherfucker!
-Aah!

50:15.846 --> 50:17.848
Hey, hey!

50:17.889 --> 50:19.182
[Ian] What the fuck?

50:19.224 --> 50:20.851
Hey, hey, stop!

50:20.892 --> 50:22.144
Chill the fuck out!

50:22.185 --> 50:23.854
Hey!

50:23.895 --> 50:25.856
What's wrong, Mama?

50:25.897 --> 50:29.860
Mama's really gonna
miss her family.

50:29.901 --> 50:34.906
All by myself

50:34.948 --> 50:36.658
Don't want to be

50:36.700 --> 50:39.911
All by myself

50:39.953 --> 50:42.706
-Where have you been?
-V, this is gonna sound crazy.

50:42.748 --> 50:45.042
But I accidentally got
a bartending job.

50:45.083 --> 50:46.585
-What? How?
-This guy got sick.

50:46.626 --> 50:48.211
I'm eatin' a burger.
I don't know.

50:48.253 --> 50:49.921
Right place, right time,
I guess.

50:49.963 --> 50:51.840
But I made more in tips today

50:51.882 --> 50:53.550
than we do at the Alibi
in a week!

50:53.592 --> 50:54.843
-No.
-Yeah!

50:54.885 --> 50:56.887
Running your own business
is a fool's game.

50:56.928 --> 50:59.931
We should sell the Alibi,
move down here, and make bank.

50:59.973 --> 51:02.309
I maybe got offered
a job today, too.

51:02.350 --> 51:05.020
Working on a campaign
for Congress.

51:05.062 --> 51:08.815
Congress?
Holy shit, that's amazing.

51:08.857 --> 51:11.068
That's government, right?

51:11.109 --> 51:14.071
bright music

51:19.117 --> 51:22.079
Are we gonna do this?

51:22.120 --> 51:25.582
[sighs] We can't do this,
can we?

51:29.086 --> 51:33.215
I fell in love
before I could learn

51:33.256 --> 51:35.592
To love myself, my mental
health is getting worse

51:35.634 --> 51:37.094
And she's gone

51:37.135 --> 51:39.513
I'm a victim
of playing it safe

51:39.554 --> 51:41.556
Too little too late

51:41.598 --> 51:43.308
Afraid of the stakes

51:44.810 --> 51:46.061
Pliers?

51:47.771 --> 51:49.815
Thanks.

51:49.856 --> 51:52.984
I'd have waited five

51:53.026 --> 51:55.112
To be rejected

51:55.153 --> 51:58.406
By your smile

52:02.536 --> 52:04.162
I'm sorry.

52:06.790 --> 52:08.125
Tough day?

52:11.002 --> 52:13.130
Got to spend a couple grand
on pipes

52:13.171 --> 52:15.632
to get the gas turned back on.

52:15.674 --> 52:18.635
Had to sell my Indian for about
half of what it's worth.

52:18.677 --> 52:21.638
Frank's stealin' masterpieces,
Debbie hates me,

52:21.680 --> 52:24.683
and Tami and Fred are living
in her dad's house, so, um...

52:26.601 --> 52:28.478
Yeah, I've seen better days.

52:35.193 --> 52:37.028
I don't know
what the fuck I'm doing.

52:39.030 --> 52:41.324
Yeah, the last part is true.

52:43.034 --> 52:46.246
All the other stuff is just
your brain fuckin' with you.

52:46.288 --> 52:47.998
You got a great family.

52:48.039 --> 52:50.667
Debbie's Debbie.

52:50.709 --> 52:53.837
You did an amazing job
fixing up the Indian.

52:53.879 --> 52:58.216
All this "woe is me" shit--
that's the old you.

52:58.258 --> 53:00.051
Maybe you need a meeting.

53:05.265 --> 53:07.475
Yeah.

53:07.517 --> 53:09.311
Thanks.

53:09.352 --> 53:11.646
Hit my husband again,
I'll fuckin' kill you.

53:11.688 --> 53:13.481
Right.

53:15.108 --> 53:16.276
Have you figured out

53:16.318 --> 53:18.486
how we're gonna get rid
of the painting?

53:18.528 --> 53:20.822
I swear I put it
in the top bunk.

53:20.864 --> 53:23.200
[Ian] Where the hell
could it be?

53:23.241 --> 53:25.535
[Lip] No! Shit!

53:27.245 --> 53:29.539
[Franny humming]

53:33.752 --> 53:35.045
[Lip] Franny--

53:35.086 --> 53:37.130
Look!

53:37.172 --> 53:38.215
Stickers!

53:38.256 --> 53:40.550
Aren't they pretty?

53:40.592 --> 53:43.220
[needle buzzing]

53:43.261 --> 53:45.305
[heavy rock music]

53:45.347 --> 53:47.641
[Frank]
Don't look so glum, kid.

53:47.682 --> 53:50.310
Everybody dies
sooner or later.

53:50.352 --> 53:52.896
I'm not ready
to check out yet.

53:52.938 --> 53:55.565
It was a good life.

53:55.607 --> 53:57.567
You know what
I'm proudest of?

53:57.609 --> 53:59.069
[Liam] Your kids?

53:59.110 --> 54:01.446
[Frank] Ha ha ha ha!
No.

54:01.488 --> 54:04.282
That I got to live it my way.

54:08.370 --> 54:10.705
There you go.

54:12.249 --> 54:13.833
I'm a six-foot

54:13.875 --> 54:15.669
[Liam] What do you think?

54:15.710 --> 54:17.212
It's perfect.

54:17.254 --> 54:20.548
All-American man

54:20.590 --> 54:22.884
Yeah-eah

54:22.926 --> 54:25.470
Ow

54:44.990 --> 54:47.617
upbeat music

54:50.954 --> 54:53.456
So I started
from the bottom

54:53.498 --> 54:56.293
Now I'm here

54:56.334 --> 55:00.297
And I've seen so many
places, it's not clear

55:02.424 --> 55:04.759
I finally had to
tell myself

55:04.801 --> 55:07.554
You won't find love
from someone else

55:07.595 --> 55:11.141
I got to keep on movin'
without fear

55:11.182 --> 55:13.393
'Cause I'm livin'
the good life

55:13.435 --> 55:15.937
Livin' it up,
livin' the good life

55:15.979 --> 55:18.606
Livin' it up, livin'
the good life

55:18.648 --> 55:20.775
Livin' the good life,
livin' the good life
