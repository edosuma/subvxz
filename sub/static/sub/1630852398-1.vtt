motherfucker can't do this.

05:27.785 --> 05:29.495

who's writing

05:29.579 --> 05:31.539

can't do this.

05:31.622 --> 05:36.419
It's like, "You..." (EXHALES)
"You-- You-- You trouble."

05:36.502 --> 05:39.756
He goes in and does
the entire song,

05:39.839 --> 05:42.425
from start to finish,
the whole song.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.802
The entire thing. Three minutes,
four minutes,

05:44.886 --> 05:46.721
however long the beat
is, he's going.

05:46.804 --> 05:47.805
So, he does the whole song,

05:47.889 --> 05:49.098
and he goes,
"All right, run it back again."

05:49.182 --> 05:52.060
Does a whole different song.
Complete different song.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.020
Then he goes, "All right,
run it back one more time."

05:54.103 --> 05:55.146
Whole different song again.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.481
And then he goes,
"Pick the best one."

05:56.564 --> 05:58.191
And then we do
it nine more times.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.650
Each time I'm in with him.

05:59.734 --> 06:04.238
And it was... In that moment,
my jaw dropped.

06:04.322 --> 06:07.200
And I said, "Oh, I'm in
the room with a superstar."

06:07.283 --> 06:09.660
Like, I'm in a room with a guy
who's gonna go down in history

06:09.744 --> 06:11.329
as one of the greatest artists
of all time.

06:11.412 --> 06:12.830
I remember the first time
seeing his name

06:12.914 --> 06:15.792
up there with, like,
"Drake, Juice,

06:15.875 --> 06:19.128

06:19.212 --> 06:21.631

trying to be that.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.482

He just became that.

27:44.621 --> 27:47.749
ANNOUNCER: Make some fucking
noise for Juice WRLD!

27:50.043 --> 27:51.628
JUICE: I think I'm gonna be
spending most of my time

27:51.711 --> 27:53.004
in L.A., though,
until I get, like,

27:53.088 --> 27:55.548
tour and shit,
'cause I'm trying to like,

27:55.632 --> 27:59.636
just be out here
in a stationary place,

27:59.719 --> 28:03.765
then entertain myself with some
of these drugs and just...

28:03.848 --> 28:05.934
-ILOVEMAKONNEN ON PHONE: Yeah.
-I wanna ride dirt bikes

28:06.017 --> 28:07.560
and just chill.

28:07.644 --> 28:08.645
That's what I'm saying.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.105
ILOVEMAKONNEN:
You have to do that.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.732
Yeah, couple of dudes get some
of this anxiety off my chest.

28:12.816 --> 28:15.735
ILOVEMAKONNEN: Yeah. How's
it dealing with all this?

28:16.361 --> 28:17.404
It's like...

28:17.487 --> 28:18.613
ILOVEMAKONNEN:
This is brand-new,

28:18.696 --> 28:19.781
-you know what I'm saying?
-Yeah.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.074
ILOVEMAKONNEN:
It can come up on you fast.

28:21.157 --> 28:22.867
-ILOVEMAKONNEN: It's like--
-I mean, it's like,

28:22.951 --> 28:24.494
bro, it's like...

28:26.579 --> 28:29.249
everything feels surreal.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.292
-ILOVEMAKONNEN: Yeah.
-So, it's easy...

28:32.168 --> 28:34.170
to just keep moving.

28:34.254 --> 28:37.090
-ILOVEMAKONNEN: Yeah.
-And sometimes,

28:37.173 --> 28:40.176
I just wanna take a second out
of my day and think about it.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.803
Like, obviously,
I know I'm blessed.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.012
I'm beyond thankful.

28:43.096 --> 28:45.181
Like, I thank God every day
for this shit.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.766
Like, I'm blessed, bro.

28:47.851 --> 28:51.146
But... it still feels surreal.

28:51.229 --> 28:53.606
It still feels like
at any moment in time,

28:53.690 --> 28:56.276
I could wake up and be in my bed

28:56.359 --> 28:58.361
and be like, "What the fuck?"

28:58.445 --> 29:00.405
I knew this was
a giant type shit,

29:00.488 --> 29:01.614
-but...
-ILOVEMAKONNEN: Yeah, exactly.

29:01.698 --> 29:04.117
...I feel like, when I stop
and think about it,

29:04.200 --> 29:05.910
if I stop and think about it,

29:05.994 --> 29:07.787
that's how my head
is gonna get too full,

29:07.871 --> 29:10.165
and that's how I'm gonna become

29:10.248 --> 29:12.625
an asshole or somebody
that went Hollywood,

29:12.709 --> 29:16.296
somebody that-- No,
not a genuine person.

29:16.379 --> 29:18.173
-ILOVEMAKONNEN: Yeah.
-So, I just keep it moving,

29:18.256 --> 29:20.008
I just make sure
to count my blessings.

29:20.091 --> 29:22.927
And sometimes, this shit
gets overwhelming,

29:23.011 --> 29:25.972
but this is what I asked for,
you know, bro?

29:26.055 --> 29:28.683
-ILOVEMAKONNEN: Yeah.
-And I wouldn't

29:28.766 --> 29:31.060
wanna do anything else.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.270
ILOVEMAKONNEN:
Yeah, I'm feeling that.

29:32.353 --> 29:34.606
I wouldn't.
This is my passion. I love...

29:34.689 --> 29:37.901
I love music, I love
spreading a message,

29:37.984 --> 29:41.196
-I love speaking my mind...
-ILOVEMAKONNEN: Yeah.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.656
...and me being able
to do all those things

29:43.740 --> 29:46.367
on one platform is, honestly,

29:46.451 --> 29:49.162
-it's a blessing, bro.
So, like...
-ILOVEMAKONNEN: Yeah.

29:49.245 --> 29:50.413
...I wouldn't change
it for the world,

29:50.497 --> 29:51.998
even though sometimes,
you know,

29:52.081 --> 29:55.335
shit just kind of...
shit keep getting hectic.

29:56.419 --> 29:57.504
ILOVEMAKONNEN: Yeah.

coming from somebody

30:25.782 --> 30:26.950
like, that I admire, bro.

30:27.033 --> 30:29.452

'Cause it's like...

30:54.310 --> 30:57.730

-You were telling me
a little bit about,

struggled with anxiety
over the years.

on that a little bit
in this album?

-I do.

like a lot of people neglect,

35:28.084 --> 35:30.837

utterly wrong.

35:36.008 --> 35:37.885
I know that this stuff
is neglected

35:37.969 --> 35:40.137
in, like, our community.

your daddy, your aunty, whoever,

35:42.974 --> 35:46.394
that you feel like
you got anxiety,

35:46.477 --> 35:47.770

you got depression,

I don't got something, you know?

37:10.478 --> 37:12.313
I didn't know
until my sophomore year,

37:12.396 --> 37:15.107
really, my junior year
damn near, that any nigga

37:15.191 --> 37:17.443
could go to a recording studio.

37:17.526 --> 37:19.487
I thought that shit was, like,

37:19.570 --> 37:22.365
strictly for famous people
only, you know?

37:22.448 --> 37:24.700
And then it clicked in my head
that there's a bunch of people,

37:24.784 --> 37:27.453
not famous, rapping.
But I thought, like,

37:27.536 --> 37:28.746
a motherfucker had to notice you

37:28.829 --> 37:32.124
and then put you in that
position to record at a studio.

37:32.208 --> 37:35.044
But when I started finding out
you can go by yourself,

37:35.127 --> 37:37.505
I was over it. I used to record
music on my phone.

37:37.588 --> 37:41.259
-(CAMERA CLICKS)
-Like, in the basement.
And I used to...

37:41.342 --> 37:45.513
I used to free-- I was just able
to freestyle very well,

37:45.596 --> 37:48.849
but I used to write
because I didn't wanna...

37:48.933 --> 37:50.434
For one, I wanted a chorus...

37:51.852 --> 37:53.020
But we didn't wanna finna
go to the studio.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.981
Right, bro? Fuck it.
I'm talking about the studios.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.857
-Like, I didn't wanna go.
-SPEAKER 1: (CHUCKLES)

37:56.941 --> 37:58.317
I don't know,
I be recording, like,

37:58.401 --> 38:00.152
ten songs a night sometimes.

38:00.236 --> 38:01.696
I be freestyling everything now.

38:01.779 --> 38:04.573
Like, back to what
I was saying...

38:04.657 --> 38:05.866
I-- I- When I first--

38:05.950 --> 38:08.452
Even when I first started
going to the recording studio,

38:08.536 --> 38:09.787
I would freestyle a little bit.

38:09.870 --> 38:12.832
But then when I started taking
this shit more seriously,

38:12.915 --> 38:14.000
I would write.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.210
Because I didn't have
enough money

38:16.293 --> 38:18.838
to just be
in the studio all day.

38:18.921 --> 38:20.881
And I ain't had no job.
I used to have to rob

38:20.965 --> 38:23.300
and do all type of shit
to get my cash. So like...

38:24.468 --> 38:26.262
I didn't wanna waste
no time in the studio,

38:26.345 --> 38:28.055
so I came with my shit
already prepared.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.598
At least I knew I was gonna get

38:29.682 --> 38:31.934
three songs done
regardless, you know?

38:32.018 --> 38:34.645
'Cause I used to only
be in there for two hours.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.982
So, like, I would make sure
I have three songs ready

38:38.065 --> 38:40.401
and pre-set for the shit.

'cause he was sitting

1:14:58.619 --> 1:15:02.372
My name's Anthony Lott. I'm 13,
and my question for you is,

1:15:02.456 --> 1:15:04.917
what made you wanna, like,
start doing music?

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.377
In grade school,
I did a lot of sports,

1:15:07.461 --> 1:15:09.296
I played basketball,
I played baseball.

1:15:09.379 --> 1:15:11.131
I was just average-good,
you know?

1:15:11.215 --> 1:15:13.091
So, like, there's 30
other people just

1:15:13.175 --> 1:15:14.927
as good as me
if not better on the court.

1:15:15.010 --> 1:15:17.054
At music, I was over average,

1:15:17.137 --> 1:15:18.847
and I gave it my
all and it came easy.

1:15:18.931 --> 1:15:21.516
So that's just something
I always excelled in.

1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:24.561
Even when I was playing piano,
playing guitar, whatever.

1:15:24.645 --> 1:15:26.063
Always just excelled in music.

So, why not take
it as far it could go?

I had a lot of shit in my head

1:17:15.964 --> 1:17:17.716
and I was just like,
it was the first day

1:17:17.799 --> 1:17:18.884
I had like...

1:17:20.385 --> 1:17:21.678
You know what, first day

1:17:21.762 --> 1:17:24.139
I had really, like,
thought about, like...

1:17:24.222 --> 1:17:28.393
making better choices in life.
And I was just like,

1:17:28.477 --> 1:17:30.354
you know, how when you trying
to make a change,

1:17:30.437 --> 1:17:31.855
I don't know if this is
what you all do,

1:17:31.938 --> 1:17:33.357
-but this is what I do.
-ALLY: (CHUCKLES)

1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:35.025
If I'm trying to make a change
in something,

1:17:35.108 --> 1:17:36.693
I'm trying to change
myself in a way,

1:17:36.777 --> 1:17:38.695
I look at, like, all the reasons

1:17:38.779 --> 1:17:41.573
why to do that. You know
what I'm saying? So, like,

1:17:42.282 --> 1:17:43.658
the reason for...

1:17:44.868 --> 1:17:46.161
somebody to, you know,

1:17:46.244 --> 1:17:48.330
to get sober is to be there
for their family

1:17:48.413 --> 1:17:49.498
or to, you know what I'm saying?

1:17:49.581 --> 1:17:50.916
To be there for their loved
ones or whatever--

1:17:50.999 --> 1:17:52.376
SPEAKER 1:
When you sang, "My mama
would never forgive me,"

1:17:52.459 --> 1:17:53.835
I was like, "Damn.
I felt that shit."

1:17:53.919 --> 1:17:55.003
Or like, you know, like,

1:17:55.087 --> 1:17:56.797
my girl, right?
You know what I'm saying.

1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:58.423
She's the type
to worry. So, like,

1:17:58.507 --> 1:17:59.883
if something happens to me,

1:17:59.966 --> 1:18:01.468
she would never, you know
what I'm saying?
She would never--

1:18:01.551 --> 1:18:02.803
Or... (INHALES)

1:18:02.886 --> 1:18:06.264
...she's the type that
she don't want me to, like...

1:18:06.348 --> 1:18:08.517
Since I'm famous and everything
is at my disposal,

1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:10.811
she don't want me
to get tired of her.

1:18:10.894 --> 1:18:13.188
You know what I'm saying?
That type of shit. So...

1:18:13.271 --> 1:18:14.856
But you know how, like,
some people say

1:18:14.940 --> 1:18:16.358
drugs turn somebody's attitude

1:18:16.441 --> 1:18:18.151
and make somebody
a different person.

1:18:18.235 --> 1:18:19.945
So, that's why I was like,

1:18:20.028 --> 1:18:21.238
"It's numbin' my feelings.

1:18:21.321 --> 1:18:24.116
If I let 'em kill 'em,
my baby ain't never forgive me."

1:18:24.199 --> 1:18:26.827
Like, it was like...
It was some real shit.

1:18:26.910 --> 1:18:28.745
That shit be going
over niggas' heads.

1:18:28.829 --> 1:18:31.581
Yeah, it's really on something.

1:18:31.665 --> 1:18:33.917
I say certain things so I could

1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:35.544
have conversations
with my friends,

1:18:35.627 --> 1:18:37.129
you know what I'm saying?
Just like this,

1:18:37.212 --> 1:18:38.380
and we get to know each other

1:18:38.463 --> 1:18:39.756
-better at the end of the day.
-Uh-huh.

1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:40.966
Like, it's just like a--

1:18:41.049 --> 1:18:42.968
If people get it outside
my circle then--

1:18:43.051 --> 1:18:44.136

MIKE P: I wanna say
we might've did

1:26:49.162 --> 1:26:50.580
six shows out in Australia.

1:26:51.623 --> 1:26:55.126
And it was, like,
every show was like...

1:26:55.210 --> 1:26:58.254
It was like, we were trying
to hit the 45-mark

1:26:58.338 --> 1:27:00.548
because that's what
he was getting paid for.

1:27:00.632 --> 1:27:04.719
And it was like,
I was pulling him to do it.

1:27:04.802 --> 1:27:07.013
I don't know if he thought that
the plane was waiting on him

1:27:07.096 --> 1:27:09.807
soon as he got to the back door
or something at the venue,

1:27:09.891 --> 1:27:12.936
but it was just like,
it was so many fans there.

1:27:13.019 --> 1:27:14.103
That I was like, "Man, bro,

1:27:14.187 --> 1:27:16.689
we gotta make
it through the setlist."

1:27:17.857 --> 1:27:20.234
I-- I-- I remember
telling him this shit, like,

1:27:20.318 --> 1:27:21.861
"G, we gotta make
it through the setlist."

1:27:23.404 --> 1:27:25.365
"Well, so, what else
can we cut out, Mike?"

1:27:25.448 --> 1:27:28.576
"None of it.
It's our last night here, bro."

1:27:28.660 --> 1:27:30.620
He still liked to sip Lean.

1:27:31.037 --> 1:27:33.039
Um...

1:27:33.122 --> 1:27:36.751
But he didn't sip it
as often because...

1:27:36.834 --> 1:27:39.671
Ally made that a thing

1:27:39.754 --> 1:27:41.673
that he couldn't
do that anymore.

1:27:41.756 --> 1:27:44.384
So, Ally was pretty
strict about that.

1:27:44.467 --> 1:27:46.719
But of course,
he would still do it

1:27:46.803 --> 1:27:48.680
and he would hide it.

1:27:48.763 --> 1:27:51.516
And when he did get it,
he would always be like,

1:27:51.599 --> 1:27:53.059
"Go pour me up this."

1:27:53.142 --> 1:27:54.435
You know what I mean?
"Go take it up."

1:27:54.519 --> 1:27:56.521
And we'd-- He'd have
to hide it in something

1:27:56.604 --> 1:27:58.231
wait till Ally's
asleep and stuff.

1:27:58.314 --> 1:28:00.692
But he'd be like,
"Pour me a four in this,"

1:28:00.775 --> 1:28:02.151
or whatever, and I...
(CHUCKLES)

1:28:02.235 --> 1:28:04.404
I'd never pour him up
what he thought he
was pouring up,

1:28:04.487 --> 1:28:08.491
and then he'd be in there, like,
"Pour a four in this,"

1:28:08.574 --> 1:28:10.952
but then I really poured,
like, a one. (CHUCKLES)

1:28:11.035 --> 1:28:12.620
He'd really be pouring,
like, a one in that

1:28:12.704 --> 1:28:13.830
and he wouldn't even know it.

1:28:13.913 --> 1:28:18.042
If Ally's in the studio,
he'll text me like...

1:28:18.126 --> 1:28:20.420
"Go get a can of Sprite."
I never forget this.

1:28:20.503 --> 1:28:23.840
"Go get a can of Sprite
and pour a four."

1:28:24.674 --> 1:28:26.134
In a can of Sprite.

1:28:27.468 --> 1:28:30.054
Now, if niggas don't understand
that terminology,

1:28:30.138 --> 1:28:35.560
a four is four ounces of Lean.
Four ounces.

1:28:35.643 --> 1:28:40.273
You could pour one ounce
in a soda, rock out with that,

1:28:41.190 --> 1:28:43.192
in a regular 20-ounce soda.

1:28:43.276 --> 1:28:48.072
This nigga drops fours
in a canned-fucking-soda.

1:28:48.156 --> 1:28:50.575
And what blew my mind
was, I'm like,

1:28:50.658 --> 1:28:54.078
"Whoa!" Like, I'm reading
the text like, "Oh..."

1:28:54.162 --> 1:28:58.374
Okay. I'm going out to fuck
around and go get it,

1:28:58.458 --> 1:29:03.087
Chris Long out there, he like,
"You about to go get the..."

1:29:03.171 --> 1:29:04.255
I'm like, "Yeah." You feel me?

1:29:04.338 --> 1:29:05.757
Like, you... (CHUCKLES)
...already know.

1:29:05.840 --> 1:29:07.842
And he like, "Yeah,
don't pour four."

1:29:08.718 --> 1:29:10.011
"Don't pour him a four."

1:29:10.094 --> 1:29:11.429
"Pour him a line and a half,

1:29:11.512 --> 1:29:13.890
if that. Do not pour four
in that soda."

1:29:13.973 --> 1:29:15.141
Yo, what's up, guys?

1:29:15.224 --> 1:29:17.643
I'm Chris Long. Welcome
to another vlog on my channel.

1:29:17.727 --> 1:29:20.521
As you know,
I'm Juice WRLD's photographer

1:29:20.605 --> 1:29:22.440
and videographer,
whatever, so...

1:29:23.357 --> 1:29:25.151
this weekend,
we're going to Chicago

1:29:25.234 --> 1:29:26.319
to celebrate his birthday.

1:29:26.402 --> 1:29:28.321
It was just his birthday
the other day,

1:29:28.404 --> 1:29:31.908
but we're going
this weekend, Saturday.

1:29:31.991 --> 1:29:33.409
We're flying out there.

1:29:33.493 --> 1:29:35.286
We're gonna have
a birthday party

1:29:35.369 --> 1:29:37.080
with his mom, and family,
and friends

1:29:37.163 --> 1:29:38.331
and stuff like that
from out there.

1:29:38.414 --> 1:29:41.084
So we're getting ready
to leave right now.

1:29:41.167 --> 1:29:42.668
Normally,
I would just be around,

1:29:42.752 --> 1:29:47.131
but I had some errands to run
because I was Juice's,

1:29:47.215 --> 1:29:48.716
like, personal cinematographer,

1:29:48.800 --> 1:29:51.761
but I also was his
personal assistant.

1:29:51.844 --> 1:29:54.388
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1:29:55.264 --> 1:29:57.809
CHRIS LONG:
He had a pint of Lean,

1:29:57.892 --> 1:29:59.310
and it was hidden in my room.

1:29:59.393 --> 1:30:03.940
And when I got back
to the house, that was gone.

1:30:04.023 --> 1:30:06.567
And then I know that him
and Ally were in the room

1:30:06.651 --> 1:30:09.987
and I could hear them fighting,
'cause he was really high.

1:30:10.071 --> 1:30:11.322
So while I was gone,

1:30:11.405 --> 1:30:14.784
I'm pretty sure he drank
that whole pint by himself.

1:30:14.867 --> 1:30:17.787
And then in combination
with the pills that he took...

1:30:17.870 --> 1:30:19.122
CHRIS: We calculated it up,

1:30:19.205 --> 1:30:23.042
and it was, like, over 20 pills
a day he was doing.

1:30:23.126 --> 1:30:25.503
-INTERVIEWER:
Twenty Percocets a day?
-CHRIS: Yeah.

1:30:25.586 --> 1:30:27.088
What's up? Check it out.

1:30:31.259 --> 1:30:35.555
All right, we are on our way
to the airport right now.

1:30:35.638 --> 1:30:39.517
Going through a tunnel,
and we're flying to Chicago.

1:30:39.600 --> 1:30:40.810
Here we go.

1:30:40.893 --> 1:30:43.479
I think that one's us,
straight ahead.

1:30:50.820 --> 1:30:52.405
-CABIN CREW 1: Hello.
-CHRIS: Hi. How are you?

1:30:52.488 --> 1:30:53.614
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1:30:53.698 --> 1:30:56.659
CHRIS: We were, like,
six hours late for the flight.

1:30:56.742 --> 1:30:57.994
So right away,

1:30:58.077 --> 1:31:01.455
the pilot's probably
pissed about that.

1:31:01.539 --> 1:31:04.709
SEAN BAILEY: I remember seeing
the pilot do something

1:31:04.792 --> 1:31:06.043
that looked kind of...

1:31:06.961 --> 1:31:08.713
you know, weird, I guess.

1:31:08.796 --> 1:31:10.298
I remember just sitting down,

1:31:10.381 --> 1:31:12.300
he was just, like,
kind of on the side.

1:31:12.967 --> 1:31:14.594
Just observing us.

1:31:14.677 --> 1:31:16.012
CHRIS: It was like
the last flight out.

1:31:16.095 --> 1:31:17.388
We should've taken
off pretty fast,

1:31:17.471 --> 1:31:18.848
but, like, we probably
sat around

1:31:18.931 --> 1:31:20.892
for, like, 15 minutes
before it took off.

1:31:20.975 --> 1:31:22.476
And I'm like,
"Something's not right."

1:31:24.061 --> 1:31:27.356
-Lotta stars in this bitch.
-Come get with the winning team,

1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:28.983

1:31:35.448 --> 1:31:36.782
There's the future right there.

1:31:36.866 --> 1:31:41.370
SEAN: We ain't losing, man.
We gamblin' with loaded dice.

1:31:41.454 --> 1:31:44.498
We can't lose.
We gamblin' with loaded dice.

1:31:45.041 --> 1:31:46.375
(CHUCKLES)

1:31:46.459 --> 1:31:49.754
And then, we finally took off.
And then that was it.

1:31:49.837 --> 1:31:51.881
HENRY DEAN: Before they got
there, it was just regular.

1:31:51.964 --> 1:31:53.090
We literally just drove right in

1:31:53.174 --> 1:31:54.425
and we were sitting
there waiting,

1:31:54.509 --> 1:31:55.593
me and the drivers.

1:31:55.676 --> 1:31:57.678
As we was waiting, when...

1:31:57.762 --> 1:31:59.263
the wheels touch the ground,

1:31:59.347 --> 1:32:00.890
that's when I'm seeing
cars pulling up.

1:32:00.973 --> 1:32:02.850
And I pretty much thought
they were fans...

1:32:03.809 --> 1:32:05.144
'cause they was marked cars,

1:32:05.228 --> 1:32:07.563
and then, until I seen
a sheriff car.

1:32:07.647 --> 1:32:11.359
Then they also didn't tell me,
like, it was an issue,

1:32:11.442 --> 1:32:14.737
'cause I was questioning, like,
what was going on, you know?

1:32:14.820 --> 1:32:16.864
And they wouldn't tell
me anything.

1:32:18.282 --> 1:32:20.159
CHRIS: We knew
there was police there

1:32:20.243 --> 1:32:23.329
before the plane landed
because we got service.

1:32:23.412 --> 1:32:24.580
I knew he had his gun,

1:32:24.664 --> 1:32:27.250
and it was just-- just throw it
in my camera bag.

1:32:27.333 --> 1:32:29.710
And that was it,
he had nothing to worry about.

1:32:29.794 --> 1:32:32.129
That's the point
of an entourage.
You know what I mean?

1:32:32.213 --> 1:32:35.216
Like, that's the point of having
friends around that you trust.

1:32:35.299 --> 1:32:36.509
He had all the money
in the world,

1:32:36.592 --> 1:32:38.636
you know, everyone would've
got out eventually.

1:32:38.719 --> 1:32:42.098
You know what I mean?
Like, it is what it is.

1:32:42.181 --> 1:32:46.060
LAROI: I remember walking off
and seeing through the window

1:32:46.143 --> 1:32:47.520
all the police and shit.

1:32:47.603 --> 1:32:49.313
I'm thinking like,
"What the fuck?"

1:32:49.397 --> 1:32:51.857
They say, "Everybody,
get your passports out."

1:32:51.941 --> 1:32:53.484
So I was sitting down

1:32:53.567 --> 1:32:55.987
and Juice was sitting
across from me,

1:32:56.070 --> 1:32:59.365
like me and you are right now.
G Money was sitting right there.

1:33:02.785 --> 1:33:04.161
I remember...

1:33:06.038 --> 1:33:08.541
Juice and G Money shook hands.

1:33:08.624 --> 1:33:12.545
He, like, dapped up G Money.

1:33:12.628 --> 1:33:16.257
Which was sitting behind him,
back-to-back in the same chair.

1:33:16.340 --> 1:33:18.467
Sorry, I have to close
my eyes for this.

1:33:19.218 --> 1:33:20.219
And...

1:33:22.930 --> 1:33:24.765
I heard like a...

1:33:26.350 --> 1:33:29.103
I swear it was
his demons leaving him.

1:33:29.186 --> 1:33:33.482
And he screamed "Ally!"
And put his hands up to grab me,

1:33:33.566 --> 1:33:38.863
to reach for me, like, for help.
And he seized up.

1:33:38.946 --> 1:33:41.741
-(SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE)
-And J had a seizure.

1:33:43.200 --> 1:33:44.535
He started having a seizure.

1:33:44.618 --> 1:33:47.455
(SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE)

1:33:51.584 --> 1:33:53.044
He started having a seizure.

1:33:54.754 --> 1:33:57.631
Ally was trying
to get him together,

1:33:57.715 --> 1:33:58.966
snap him out of it.

1:33:59.050 --> 1:34:01.260
I kinda froze.
I didn't really know,

1:34:02.261 --> 1:34:04.347
like, what the fuck
I could do to help,

1:34:04.430 --> 1:34:05.890
but, so I was just sitting
there, panicking,

1:34:05.973 --> 1:34:08.225
and everyone was like,
"What the fuck?"

1:34:08.309 --> 1:34:11.312
And at first, we just thought
he was having a seizure,

1:34:11.395 --> 1:34:13.647
and then the blood
started coming out...

1:34:15.900 --> 1:34:19.070
of his mouth,
and his nose, and then...

1:34:23.032 --> 1:34:24.075
Everybody, obviously,

1:34:24.158 --> 1:34:26.577
started freaking
out way more then.

1:34:27.411 --> 1:34:28.913
And then the police...

1:34:30.748 --> 1:34:34.668
came over to us all
and handcuffed us all.

1:34:35.544 --> 1:34:37.046
And then they handcuffed
us in a line

1:34:37.129 --> 1:34:39.632
and then they was like,
"Get the fuck away from him!"

1:34:39.715 --> 1:34:45.137
They handcuffed us all in a line
except for Ally. Ally was like,

1:34:45.221 --> 1:34:47.098
yelling off, and...

1:34:47.181 --> 1:34:49.600
They cuff me,
and they're telling Ally like,

1:34:49.683 --> 1:34:52.853
"Chill out. He's fine.
Chill out. He's gonna be..."

1:34:52.937 --> 1:34:55.898
And we're all looking, like,
"Bro, he's bleeding." (SCOFFS)

1:34:55.981 --> 1:34:57.066
That shit was fucking me up,

1:34:57.149 --> 1:34:58.401
seeing the blood come
out his mouth.

1:34:58.484 --> 1:35:01.862
Like, I kinda like, turned
and closed my eyes.

1:35:01.946 --> 1:35:04.573
That shit was damn near
almost made me cry, in a way.

1:35:04.657 --> 1:35:06.409
I don't know,
I don't really cry for real,

1:35:06.492 --> 1:35:07.993
like, I ain't... I don't know,

1:35:08.077 --> 1:35:11.038
so I, like, just turned away,
and just seeing him,

1:35:11.122 --> 1:35:13.332
I don't know,
imagine seeing somebody,
you feel like your son,

1:35:13.416 --> 1:35:16.752
on the floor and blood,
I'm damn near finna cry almost.

1:35:16.836 --> 1:35:19.922
Ally was trying
to get him together,

1:35:20.005 --> 1:35:22.007
snap him out of it.

1:35:22.091 --> 1:35:25.636
She's yelling, screaming
for someone to help,

1:35:25.719 --> 1:35:28.889
-the cops for help.
-INTERVIEWER: Did they help?

1:35:28.973 --> 1:35:32.226
(INHALES SHARPLY)
No, not in time.

1:35:32.309 --> 1:35:34.687
It was slow.
They took their time.

1:35:35.521 --> 1:35:36.772
That's what it seemed like.

1:35:37.356 --> 1:35:38.482
(INHALES)

1:35:38.566 --> 1:35:41.235
It didn't seem like there
was any urgency with them.

1:35:41.318 --> 1:35:43.737
Thinking about it,
he was probably gone,

1:35:43.821 --> 1:35:45.990
you know? Thinking about it.

1:35:48.576 --> 1:35:50.161
Right then and there.

1:35:50.244 --> 1:35:52.913
But they took him away.
(SNIFFLES)

1:35:52.997 --> 1:35:56.292
And shit. I don't think
anybody really--

1:35:56.375 --> 1:35:57.710
Well, I hadn't been
in a situation

1:35:57.793 --> 1:36:00.754
like that, to have somebody
having a seizure, you know?

1:36:01.589 --> 1:36:02.840
I call my aunt.

1:36:03.883 --> 1:36:06.927
First thing I'm telling
her is like, "Hey.

1:36:09.221 --> 1:36:12.391
Jarad's okay,
but they're taking him.

1:36:12.475 --> 1:36:14.059
He just had a seizure.

1:36:14.143 --> 1:36:16.353
He's on his way
to the hospital."

1:36:16.437 --> 1:36:17.855
I'm thinking he was okay.

1:36:20.566 --> 1:36:21.859
I told my aunt that.

1:36:25.738 --> 1:36:29.992
My nephew called
and told me that...

1:36:30.075 --> 1:36:33.329
he had a seizure, and they were
taking him to the hospital.

1:36:33.412 --> 1:36:37.666
That's like, 3:00
in the morning or so.

1:36:37.750 --> 1:36:40.461
Of course, I did.
That's the last thing
I expected,

1:36:40.544 --> 1:36:42.379
was a call like that. But...

1:36:43.797 --> 1:36:46.300
Yeah. I remember it quite well.

1:36:47.259 --> 1:36:48.719
That's one of those things
you just,

1:36:48.802 --> 1:36:50.471
you know, I will never forget.

1:36:51.889 --> 1:36:53.307
And turn to the sudden
and shocking death

1:36:53.390 --> 1:36:54.892
of rap star Juice WRLD.

1:36:54.975 --> 1:36:56.143
The 21-year-old,
who was named

1:36:56.227 --> 1:36:57.561
Billboard's Best
New Artist this year,

1:36:57.645 --> 1:36:59.939
suffered a medical emergency
at Chicago's Midway Airport.

1:37:00.022 --> 1:37:02.191
REPORTER 1:
Late Chicago rapper Juice WRLD

1:37:02.274 --> 1:37:06.612
died as a result of oxycodone
and codeine toxicity.

1:37:06.695 --> 1:37:08.030
That's according
to the Cook County

1:37:08.113 --> 1:37:09.698
Medical Examiner's
office today.

1:37:09.782 --> 1:37:11.700
He suffered
the medical emergency

1:37:11.784 --> 1:37:13.827
at Midway Airport
as federal agents

1:37:13.911 --> 1:37:17.331
searched the luggage onboard
the private jet that he was on.

1:37:17.414 --> 1:37:20.376
REPORTER 2: These startling
pictures here obtained by TMZ

1:37:20.459 --> 1:37:21.585
show why federal authorities

1:37:21.669 --> 1:37:23.629
were taking a closer
look at the flight.

1:37:23.712 --> 1:37:27.758
Seventy pounds of cannabis found
inside 41 vacuum-sealed bags.

1:37:27.841 --> 1:37:30.427
In addition to the cannabis,
authorities also discovered

1:37:30.511 --> 1:37:33.055
six prescription bottles
of liquid codeine,

1:37:33.138 --> 1:37:35.724
three firearms,
and metal-piercing bullets.

1:37:35.808 --> 1:37:37.268
REPORTER 3:
And in another cryptic tweet

1:37:37.351 --> 1:37:39.478
he shared just last week,
Juice wrote quote,

1:37:39.562 --> 1:37:41.855
"This life is yours.
Do what the F you want to do,

1:37:41.939 --> 1:37:43.691
great things and change
the world.

1:37:43.774 --> 1:37:45.317
Don't let no one tell you...
(BEEP)

1:37:45.401 --> 1:37:47.319
...and you'll be bigger
than Juice WRLD will ever be,

1:37:47.403 --> 1:37:49.321
and he's going down
as a legend."

1:38:00.666 --> 1:38:01.792
He knew.

1:38:03.669 --> 1:38:04.670
He knew.

1:38:07.047 --> 1:38:10.259
He knew, he fucking knew...

1:38:10.342 --> 1:38:11.969
INTERVIEWER:
You think he wanted to die?

1:38:14.930 --> 1:38:18.642
I do. I listen
to all the music, man.

1:38:18.726 --> 1:38:25.399
And this, he said it
in over 20-some songs.

1:38:25.482 --> 1:38:28.694
Over 30 songs,
he said he wanted to die.

1:38:29.612 --> 1:38:32.531
And he freestyle,
he don't write.

1:38:32.615 --> 1:38:34.617
He don't even
take five seconds off

1:38:34.700 --> 1:38:36.577
to think about
what he finna say.

1:38:36.660 --> 1:38:39.121
He just go straight... (EXHALES)

1:38:40.039 --> 1:38:41.707
So, I think that's how he felt.

1:38:41.790 --> 1:38:46.170
He was so good at articulating
his thoughts and feelings...

1:38:48.339 --> 1:38:50.507
we ain't really even,
like, realized

1:38:50.591 --> 1:38:51.967
that that's the way he feeling,

1:38:52.051 --> 1:38:54.345
'cause it's turned
into so much beautiful art.

1:38:54.428 --> 1:38:57.598
He created something
so precious with it,

1:38:57.681 --> 1:39:00.142
that it was hard to, like,
separate the two.

1:39:00.225 --> 1:39:02.019
You know what I'm saying?
Like, even for him.

1:39:02.102 --> 1:39:03.479
That's what he loved to do.

1:39:03.562 --> 1:39:05.814
He loved to do everything
that he did in life.

1:39:05.898 --> 1:39:06.940
He loved to...

1:39:08.067 --> 1:39:09.985
record, he loved
to sit in the studio,

1:39:10.069 --> 1:39:11.111
he loved to stay up late,

1:39:11.195 --> 1:39:13.155
he loved to eat pizza,
he loved to get high,

1:39:13.238 --> 1:39:14.990
like, that's what he loved
to do. You feel me?

1:39:15.074 --> 1:39:17.993
And I loved to do it right
with him, to be honest, like.

1:39:18.077 --> 1:39:21.413
When I'm having a good day,
I used to drink Lean, smoke weed

1:39:21.497 --> 1:39:23.332
and pop pills.
When I'm having a bad day,

1:39:23.415 --> 1:39:26.126
I used to drink Lean,
smoke weed and pop pills.

1:39:26.210 --> 1:39:29.421
So it's hard to-- You know
what I'm saying? Separate it.

1:39:29.505 --> 1:39:31.715
I don't know what we're doing
it for, we just doing it.

1:39:31.799 --> 1:39:35.844
The idea of no longer being
on this earth anymore

1:39:35.928 --> 1:39:39.682
is such a-- It's very simple,
but it's also very complex.

1:39:39.765 --> 1:39:43.560
And I think the thought
of it is easy to process

1:39:43.644 --> 1:39:47.314
but the reality of it
isn't so easy to process.

1:39:47.398 --> 1:39:50.109
And I think that's something
that, you know...

1:39:51.485 --> 1:39:54.822
that Juice was experiencing.
He knew...

1:39:54.905 --> 1:39:56.782
Anyone in that position
knows the results

1:39:56.865 --> 1:39:59.201
of what these things could be,
but no one really processes

1:39:59.284 --> 1:40:00.411
what that actually means.

1:40:00.494 --> 1:40:02.454
And no one ever thinks
that it's actually gonna happen.

1:40:02.538 --> 1:40:06.417
You know? And I'm talking
about Juice himself. Um...

1:40:07.418 --> 1:40:09.086
He got caught up
in something that...

1:40:10.003 --> 1:40:12.131
he didn't know the power of.

1:40:12.214 --> 1:40:14.091
We ain't thinking about...

1:40:14.174 --> 1:40:16.593
the drugs, we takin' 'em--
we just taking 'em.

1:40:17.720 --> 1:40:20.055
We ain't thinking twice
about that shit.

1:40:20.139 --> 1:40:22.391
We comin' up from nothing.
This is some shit we done,

1:40:22.474 --> 1:40:24.435
what we was doing back
when we was fucked up

1:40:24.518 --> 1:40:26.603
and broke, just to maintain.

1:40:26.687 --> 1:40:27.896
It's like, you get some money,

1:40:27.980 --> 1:40:29.898
that don't mean
your problems go away.

1:40:29.982 --> 1:40:33.569
So we still on the same shit,
we just got more money to do it.

1:40:33.652 --> 1:40:36.697
So now you're doing that shit
at a higher rate.

1:40:36.780 --> 1:40:38.574
I think he was having
a tough time

1:40:38.657 --> 1:40:40.576
with just, like, the whole mix,

1:40:40.659 --> 1:40:42.745
how everything hit
him all at once.

1:40:42.828 --> 1:40:45.414
'Cause, like, once you start
getting so much money,

1:40:45.497 --> 1:40:47.374
you could start doing
so many things,

1:40:47.458 --> 1:40:49.126
and so many things
start coming at you,

1:40:49.209 --> 1:40:50.919
like, at one time. You feel me?

1:40:51.003 --> 1:40:52.463
So, it's like, how do
you even know

1:40:52.546 --> 1:40:54.256
how to control
some shit like that?

1:40:54.339 --> 1:40:56.133
You know what I mean?
So, it's like,

1:40:56.216 --> 1:40:58.886
it really goes deep,
you feel me? It gets deep.

1:40:58.969 --> 1:41:02.014
The abyss goes crazy, G.
Really and truly.

1:41:02.097 --> 1:41:03.474
INTERVIEWER:

1:41:03.557 --> 1:41:07.519
Ah! (CHUCKLES) Something
that me and Juice talked about.

1:41:08.604 --> 1:41:09.897
We both-- It's funny too,

1:41:09.980 --> 1:41:11.982
'cause me and-- me and Juice
was-- It's--

1:41:12.065 --> 1:41:14.067
me and Juice came
to, um, this terminology

1:41:14.151 --> 1:41:16.570
just by chopping it up
with each other

1:41:16.653 --> 1:41:19.907
one day, and just
talking about how, um...

1:41:19.990 --> 1:41:22.993
just like, how depression
can go, you know what I mean?

1:41:23.076 --> 1:41:28.165
And how sad things
can be and how, like,

1:41:28.248 --> 1:41:30.834
like far you can fall
into that pit,

1:41:30.918 --> 1:41:34.922
you know, that abyss
of darkness and like, just...

1:41:35.756 --> 1:41:37.090
(SIGHS) It's hard to explain.

1:41:37.174 --> 1:41:38.801
Like, demons at play,
basically, bro.

1:41:38.884 --> 1:41:40.677
The world is crazy,
really and truly,

1:41:40.761 --> 1:41:45.516
and when you're in
that mindset of the abyss,

1:41:45.599 --> 1:41:47.810
it's like, everything hits
you harder, like...

1:41:47.893 --> 1:41:49.686
That's what he would say,
he was like,

1:41:49.770 --> 1:41:54.066
"I feel just detached."
And I'm like, "So, you don't..."

1:41:54.149 --> 1:41:56.151
Like, "You don't understand,
like, you know

1:41:56.235 --> 1:41:58.487
that you're like this idol,
and like, all this,

1:41:58.570 --> 1:42:01.490
and like, you don't
see all that?" And he's like,

1:42:01.573 --> 1:42:04.743
"No, I do. But I feel like
sometimes I can't feel it."

1:42:04.827 --> 1:42:08.372
"And I can't--
Like it's not really there."

1:42:08.455 --> 1:42:11.458
We started talking about this
thing that we both have.

1:42:11.542 --> 1:42:15.128
It's called depersonalization.
And we just starting talking,

1:42:15.212 --> 1:42:19.591
you know, 'cause I had never...
Before Juice talking about it...

1:42:20.926 --> 1:42:22.386
I didn't know what that was.

1:42:22.469 --> 1:42:26.765
And my whole life, I used
to tell my family, like,

1:42:26.849 --> 1:42:30.227
"Yo, I don't feel real.
Like, I feel, like, fake."

1:42:30.310 --> 1:42:31.562
And they used to... (CHUCKLES)

1:42:31.645 --> 1:42:33.605
My family, they dumbass
used to be like,

1:42:33.689 --> 1:42:36.692
"Oh, like, what? This moment
is too good to be true?"

1:42:36.775 --> 1:42:38.819
I'm like, "No, it's not
that at all." (CHUCKLES)

1:42:38.902 --> 1:42:41.154
"It's like, I literally
don't feel real. "

1:42:41.238 --> 1:42:43.365
So talking to him
about it was kinda like...

1:42:44.283 --> 1:42:46.743
like a relief, in a way. Um...

1:42:47.995 --> 1:42:51.123
I-- You know, just talking
to somebody who understands you

1:42:51.206 --> 1:42:53.292
and understands
what you're going through.

1:42:53.375 --> 1:42:55.252
You see, I never really
understand his music,

1:42:55.335 --> 1:42:56.587
'cause it wasn't really for me,

1:42:56.670 --> 1:42:59.089
so I didn't understand,
you know, what he was saying,

1:42:59.172 --> 1:43:02.426
but obviously his fans,
they did.

1:43:02.509 --> 1:43:06.054
And there were just
so many messages

1:43:06.138 --> 1:43:07.681
how he helped them with anxiety

1:43:07.764 --> 1:43:09.308
and depression,
and some even said

1:43:09.391 --> 1:43:12.519
he stopped them from committing
suicide, and it just...

1:43:13.854 --> 1:43:15.772
I was just overwhelmed.

1:43:15.856 --> 1:43:17.024
Something about his music

1:43:17.107 --> 1:43:18.775
just touched the hearts
of people.

1:43:18.859 --> 1:43:20.360
You know, they could
just relate to it

1:43:20.444 --> 1:43:23.780
-and it made them feel better.
-CROWD: (CHEERS)

1:43:23.864 --> 1:43:26.533
CROWD: Juice WRLD!
Juice WRLD! Juice WRLD!

1:43:26.617 --> 1:43:29.745
Juice WRLD! Juice WRLD!
Juice WRLD!

1:43:29.828 --> 1:43:32.915
BENNY: One of the strangest days
of my life.

1:43:32.998 --> 1:43:34.333
Juice was supposed to perform,

1:43:34.416 --> 1:43:36.960
but they turned
it into a tribute show.

1:43:37.044 --> 1:43:40.005
And, you know,
I'd never been in front of that.

1:43:40.088 --> 1:43:42.215
There was like, seventy-five
thousand people, I think.

1:43:42.299 --> 1:43:44.426
And I went out there
and just pressed play,

1:43:44.509 --> 1:43:48.221
and I just saw, like,
every single kid

1:43:48.305 --> 1:43:50.641
singing every word.

1:43:52.100 --> 1:43:55.812
I don't even think he knew.
I don't even think he knew

1:43:55.896 --> 1:43:58.607
how much he meant
to all these kids.

1:43:58.690 --> 1:44:00.067
I really don't.

1:44:01.318 --> 1:44:03.737
Because you couldn't know.
I didn't even know.

1:44:03.820 --> 1:44:06.239
Until, like-- And I'm seeing
the way these...

1:44:07.449 --> 1:44:08.825
these kids, like,

1:44:08.909 --> 1:44:11.536
crying their eyes out,
singing every word.

1:44:11.620 --> 1:44:14.957
Whether he knew it or not,
Juice was a therapist for...

1:44:16.083 --> 1:44:17.376
millions of kids...

1:44:20.921 --> 1:44:23.799
and gave them songs that...

1:44:24.758 --> 1:44:26.635
that helped them cope with...

1:44:26.718 --> 1:44:29.721
being alone,
feeling like a loser,

1:44:29.805 --> 1:44:31.848
feeling depressed,

1:44:31.932 --> 1:44:34.059
not knowing how
to express yourself,

1:44:34.142 --> 1:44:37.813
you know?
And he was really, like,

1:44:37.896 --> 1:44:40.023
a voice of that generation.

1:44:40.107 --> 1:44:42.317

INTERVIEWER: Did you think Juice
would get as big as he did?

1:45:18.895 --> 1:45:20.397
Me, I always thought that.

1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:22.524
I think I was probably
the only one,

1:45:22.607 --> 1:45:25.027
even-- I don't even think
Juice thought that.

1:45:25.110 --> 1:45:26.945
I always knew.

1:45:27.029 --> 1:45:29.865
As soon as I heard
"Lucid Dreams," I'm like,

1:45:29.948 --> 1:45:32.367
we don't gotta do--
Like, that song just--

1:45:32.451 --> 1:45:33.702
It was different, man.

1:45:34.619 --> 1:45:38.707
Like, it cut all the extra shit.

1:45:38.790 --> 1:45:41.251
Like, we skipped steps
with that song. (CHUCKLES)

1:45:41.334 --> 1:45:46.465
You skip-- You know.
That's one of them songs.

1:45:46.548 --> 1:45:49.968
His numbers was crazy as fuck
even when he was... (COUGHS)

1:45:50.052 --> 1:45:51.511
...when he was alive.

1:45:51.595 --> 1:45:54.264
Keeping up, battling Drake
and The Weeknd

1:45:54.347 --> 1:45:57.184
and shit, like,
this nigga's over here,

1:45:57.267 --> 1:45:59.561
sword battling Drake
for numbers and shit,

1:45:59.644 --> 1:46:02.481
so I'm like, "That's
something serious."

1:46:02.564 --> 1:46:03.982
For somebody like Juice,

1:46:04.066 --> 1:46:06.193
come on, now,
bro, that's crazy as fuck.

1:46:06.276 --> 1:46:08.403
-INTERVIEWER: Who was
basically in the game...
-(COUGHS)

1:46:08.487 --> 1:46:10.238
INTERVIEWER: ...for two years?

1:46:10.322 --> 1:46:12.074
Yeah! It was like, "Hello!"

1:46:12.157 --> 1:46:14.910
And they started
doing crazy streams!

1:46:14.993 --> 1:46:16.953
Like, Drake-number streams.

1:46:17.037 --> 1:46:19.247
Like, I don't know,
out of nowhere

1:46:19.331 --> 1:46:20.999
y'all just started liking Juice,

1:46:21.083 --> 1:46:23.085
and was like--
Y'all probably don't even know

1:46:23.168 --> 1:46:24.586
what you all started
liking Juice from.

1:46:24.669 --> 1:46:25.754
You know what I'm saying?

1:46:25.837 --> 1:46:28.423
But out of nowhere,
Juice WRLD was there, G.

1:46:29.966 --> 1:46:31.426
Juice's legacy will be...

1:46:33.887 --> 1:46:37.349
making incredible music
that is timeless,

1:46:38.975 --> 1:46:41.978
being a phenomenal person...

1:46:42.062 --> 1:46:45.148
on and off the stage,
in and out of the studio,

1:46:45.232 --> 1:46:47.984
being a family man,
being a lover.

1:46:48.902 --> 1:46:50.237
That boy's a lover.

1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:53.031
That boy understands love more
than a lot of people. (CHUCKLES)

1:46:53.365 --> 1:46:54.491
Um...

1:46:54.574 --> 1:46:57.119
That boy's a lover. Um...

1:46:57.202 --> 1:47:00.413
I think just being
a well-rounded human being.

1:47:00.497 --> 1:47:03.458
You know, I think it goes
beyond the artistry with Juice.

1:47:03.542 --> 1:47:07.796
I really do. And I think
as time goes on, you know,

1:47:07.879 --> 1:47:11.216
as people appreciate
him more and more...

1:47:11.299 --> 1:47:13.760
Because that's what happens,
you know?

1:47:13.844 --> 1:47:15.178
That's how this goes.

1:47:15.262 --> 1:47:17.681
You know, there's gonna
be people who are Juice fans

1:47:17.764 --> 1:47:19.099
who aren't even born yet.

1:47:19.182 --> 1:47:20.684
You know,
that's a beautiful thing.

1:47:20.767 --> 1:47:22.727
For the rest of my life,
for the rest of your life,

1:47:22.811 --> 1:47:24.855
and for the rest
of everyone's life

1:47:24.938 --> 1:47:26.231
who's watching this right now...

1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:29.818
every minute of every day

1:47:29.901 --> 1:47:31.987
for the rest of all
of our lives,

1:47:32.070 --> 1:47:33.947
someone in the world
will be playing

1:47:34.030 --> 1:47:35.282
a Juice WRLD song.

1:47:36.366 --> 1:47:39.161
He's here forever. Um...

1:47:40.162 --> 1:47:41.872
And he's not going anywhere.

1:47:41.955 --> 1:47:46.960
And that's what a legacy is,
is leaving your music behind,

1:47:47.043 --> 1:47:49.337
and your impact,
and your message behind

1:47:49.421 --> 1:47:51.089
for people to adapt...

1:47:52.799 --> 1:47:56.303
and then, you know,
lead on with beyond that.

1:47:56.386 --> 1:47:58.763
And I think that's
what Juice's legacy is.

1:48:04.311 --> 1:48:06.563
Where am I at? I'm in paradise.

1:48:08.398 --> 1:48:11.151
I'm actually Facetiming,
I'm not Facetiming, I'm just--

1:48:11.234 --> 1:48:14.946
I'm on Instagram live
