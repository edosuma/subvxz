00:00.010 --> 00:03.170
Wasn't there cause for concern with
Selfridge? Is that company in hand?

00:03.220 --> 00:05.010
Staff out of control.

00:05.060 --> 00:08.540
Stock shifted to a business that that
has nothing to do with Selfridge's.

00:09.620 --> 00:11.410
Why have you been avoiding me, Mae?

00:11.460 --> 00:15.330
You need to give her time, prove
to her that you're the right man.

00:15.380 --> 00:19.490
I'm not the enemy. I've been trying to protect
you and your father more than you think.

00:19.540 --> 00:22.810
Mr Crabb told me that he asked
you to come back. Now I'm asking.

00:22.860 --> 00:24.850
It's a boy, George.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.890
A beautiful, healthy baby boy.

00:26.940 --> 00:29.850
You're the largest supplier of
linen and cotton in the country.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.690
Wholesalers take their cues from you.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.810
If anyone can persuade them
to lift the embargo, you can.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.370
- Jimmy killed Victor.
- So it's true? - You knew?

00:37.420 --> 00:41.170
I have to take this in. I thought I
knew you. I don't know who to trust.

00:41.220 --> 00:43.890
- Pay your price. - Harry --
- Pay your price.

00:43.940 --> 00:46.610
I want nothing more to do with you.

"Murder suspect Jimmy Dillon may
also have been facing financial ruin.

01:54.980 --> 01:58.220
There are rumours the store
Whiteleys is in serious trouble."

01:59.380 --> 02:02.810
"Mr Dillon invested heavily
in the purchase of Whiteleys,

02:02.860 --> 02:05.050
guided by business
partner Harry Selfridge."

02:05.100 --> 02:07.300
Will he be at work today?

02:07.700 --> 02:10.800
He can't leave you to
deal with everything.

02:11.820 --> 02:14.290
He'll be back when he's ready.

02:18.260 --> 02:20.060
Pa?

02:23.540 --> 02:25.020
Pa?

02:29.980 --> 02:31.970
Will you be going to the store later?

02:32.020 --> 02:33.650
Not today.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.700
It's been a week now.

02:37.660 --> 02:39.650
Today's papers are here.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.970
- I think we've seen enough.
- No.

02:42.020 --> 02:43.610
Everyone else will see them.

02:43.660 --> 02:45.850
Surely there's nothing left to say.

02:45.900 --> 02:49.700
Pa, whatever happened, Jimmy's
death is not your fault.

02:55.020 --> 02:56.820
Mae called again.

02:58.020 --> 03:00.220
She wants to talk to you.

03:06.140 --> 03:09.220
Unbelievable. I read about
it. I cannot believe it.

03:10.260 --> 03:13.290
- Excuse me.
- (Oh, she's coming...)

03:13.340 --> 03:16.340
- Can I help you, ladies?
- No, thank you.

03:18.860 --> 03:22.610
I'm surprised she's still
working here. Look at her.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.060
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

03:27.700 --> 03:31.090
- I'll look after things if you'd
like to take a break. - Thank you.

03:31.140 --> 03:33.700
Erm, I'll be in the Sewing Room.

03:36.700 --> 03:39.970
No, look. It says she was
going with Victor Colleano

03:40.020 --> 03:43.770
- and Jimmy Dillon at the same time.
- And that's why Jimmy did him in.

03:43.820 --> 03:46.780
"Twice divorced." I'm not surprised.

03:48.260 --> 03:50.800
We're here to work, not gossip.

03:53.220 --> 03:56.320
- Excuse me!
- Quite right, Miss Brockless.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.210
Here we go.

04:15.260 --> 04:17.260
I made you some tea.

04:19.459 --> 04:23.060
You don't have to wait on
me hand and foot, George.

04:23.420 --> 04:25.810
- Hello.
- Ssh, ssh.

04:25.860 --> 04:29.770
- Work'll be missing you.
- I've told 'em I'll be in later.

04:29.820 --> 04:31.890
The chief's still off.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.290
There's a lot of gossip.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.970
Ooh. Like what?

04:36.020 --> 04:38.340
He's got money troubles.

04:40.460 --> 04:43.650
Mr Selfridge? No.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.900
There's something new
in the paper every day.

04:49.300 --> 04:52.800
I still can't believe
Jimmy Dillon killed Victor.

04:53.540 --> 04:56.770
And I nearly lost my job,
helping him move that stock.

04:56.820 --> 04:58.530
George, you didn't know.

04:58.580 --> 05:01.210
I just don't like seeing
Victor's name mixed up in it all.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.090
He was my friend.

05:03.140 --> 05:06.010
That's not how I want to remember him.

05:06.100 --> 05:09.210
Well, it's a good job we've got
him to take your mind off things.

05:09.260 --> 05:10.940
Come here.

05:11.980 --> 05:16.700
I can't go back to work
until you've got a name.

05:17.740 --> 05:20.080
There's people want to know.

05:25.260 --> 05:27.530
Here, what about "Victor"?

05:28.540 --> 05:31.220
Victor George Towler.

05:32.140 --> 05:34.130
Now, that's a better way to remember him.

05:34.180 --> 05:35.850
- Yeah.
- Eh?

05:38.340 --> 05:42.490
Your behaviour, concealing the movement
of stock, has been hugely unprofessional.

05:42.540 --> 05:45.540
If it were up to the Civic,
up to me, you would be fired.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.970
I regret my involvement in the
events that have led us here.

05:50.020 --> 05:53.490
Meanwhile, the papers are full of
scandalous stories about Mr Dillon.

05:53.540 --> 05:55.850
And I gather Mr Selfridge
is nowhere to be seen.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.370
Mr Gordon is holding the fort.

05:59.540 --> 06:02.170
The Civic need to be reassured
that matters are in hand.

06:02.220 --> 06:03.810
I would like to see

06:03.860 --> 06:06.860
- Mr Selfridge's
personal accounts. - Why?

06:07.940 --> 06:10.280
Openness and accountability.

06:11.420 --> 06:13.530
I trust everything is in order.

06:13.580 --> 06:15.220
Of course.

06:24.700 --> 06:27.800
It's not working. Not
working. Not working.

06:46.180 --> 06:48.690
Ooh!

06:48.740 --> 06:50.740
A-ha!

06:51.860 --> 06:55.650
- What are you doing?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.340
Come with me!

07:04.900 --> 07:06.500
Ta-dah!

07:08.500 --> 07:12.250
Three days to go until the
20th anniversary celebrations.

07:12.300 --> 07:15.780
- And it will change every day, counting down.
- You're very clever.

07:23.060 --> 07:24.650
Yes, I am.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.720
Mr Keen to see you, sir.

07:31.060 --> 07:32.650
Mr Keen.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.450
Publicity for our 20th anniversary.

07:34.500 --> 07:38.290
- What does Mr Selfridge think?
- I'm sure he'll be very happy.

07:38.340 --> 07:40.050
He's not in, then?

07:40.100 --> 07:42.290
I'm managing things in
my father's absence.

07:42.340 --> 07:44.330
Everything's under control.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.490
Excuse me, sir, you may not just come in!

07:47.540 --> 07:49.210
Mr Hardcastle.

07:50.180 --> 07:51.890
Not a man to be made a fool of.

07:51.940 --> 07:55.850
- Perhaps we could discuss this a little more...
- Whiteleys employs a lot of people.

07:55.900 --> 07:59.610
Did you think no-one'd notice you moving
stock from Selfridge's to Whiteleys?

07:59.660 --> 08:03.130
- That shouldn't have happened.
- I went to my members in good faith

08:03.180 --> 08:05.720
to end the embargo on Whiteleys.

08:06.020 --> 08:10.250
Your father promised he would make good the
debts there in time. And I trusted him.

08:10.300 --> 08:15.370
Whiteleys and Selfridge's are under
embargo until our debts are paid in full.

08:15.420 --> 08:18.460
Mr Hardcastle, that could close us down.

08:33.299 --> 08:37.890
No more newspapers, definitely
no press, only family.

08:37.940 --> 08:40.280
Certainly, Mrs De Bolotoff.

08:55.380 --> 08:56.700
Hello?

08:57.740 --> 08:59.810
Rosalie, I need to speak to Harry.

08:59.860 --> 09:01.410
Mae, I'm so sorry.

09:01.460 --> 09:04.050
I just need to talk to
him, Rosalie, please.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.410
Mae, excuse me one moment.

09:06.460 --> 09:08.170
- Oh, Gordon.
- Is he in there?

09:08.220 --> 09:10.560
Yes, but he doesn't want...

09:15.140 --> 09:17.530
Mae, I-I don't know what to say.

09:17.580 --> 09:19.890
I've told Pa you want to speak to him.

09:19.940 --> 09:21.940
Tell him I'm here.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.860
Pa, why aren't you at the store?

09:32.900 --> 09:35.980
- I told Rosalie I didn't want to see anyone.
- I'm not "anyone".

09:36.940 --> 09:39.010
I need to talk to you.

09:39.380 --> 09:41.290
There's a trade embargo on Selfridge's.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.450
Hardcastle found out
about the stock switch.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.530
Which means no-one will supply Selfridge's

09:46.580 --> 09:48.370
until we pay their debts at Whiteleys.

09:48.420 --> 09:50.090
I know Jimmy's death has been a shock

09:50.140 --> 09:54.130
but, because of what he did,
we're in terrible trouble.

09:54.180 --> 09:57.020
I put too much trust in him.

09:59.340 --> 10:01.340
We were all dazzled.

10:03.660 --> 10:07.900
You know, I... I think
you saw yourself in him.

10:09.980 --> 10:12.120
More than you did in me.

10:13.020 --> 10:15.360
I dragged you into all this.

10:15.860 --> 10:17.850
I'm sorry.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.490
What's done is done.

10:19.540 --> 10:21.810
Now we need you back at the store.

10:21.860 --> 10:23.530
I can't do it.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.930
You were a success long before
any of us heard of Jimmy Dillon.

10:28.980 --> 10:30.980
And you can be again.

10:32.020 --> 10:34.890
- I don't trust myself.
- I trust you.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.700
You're still Harry Selfridge, Pa.

10:39.820 --> 10:43.460
You can come back or you can leave it
all up to me, but you need to decide.

10:46.660 --> 10:48.540
Fast.

11:02.220 --> 11:04.450
- Thank you.
- Good morning.

11:04.500 --> 11:07.250
- Pa... - The 20th
anniversary is next week,

11:07.300 --> 11:09.530
so we need to break the
embargo before then.

11:09.580 --> 11:12.450
I want every department
to do a stock check today.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.410
I need to know exactly how
much we have, or how little.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.900
Yes, Chief. Welcome back.

11:22.980 --> 11:26.690
Jimmy Dillon was the joint owner of
Whiteleys. He didn't leave a will,

11:26.740 --> 11:29.690
so his share passes automatically
to you and the chief.

11:29.740 --> 11:33.530
- Which will take months.
- So selling Whiteleys is out of the question.

11:33.580 --> 11:35.970
If we can't pay the suppliers' debts,

11:36.020 --> 11:38.210
we're gonna have to offer
them something else.

11:38.260 --> 11:40.770
Relations with suppliers
have been badly damaged.

11:40.820 --> 11:43.920
Whatever it is, I think
it'd be a hard sell.

11:44.820 --> 11:46.810
That's exactly what I'm good at.

11:46.860 --> 11:50.260
Draw up a list of suppliers.
Let's see what I can sell them.

11:53.740 --> 11:56.570
I'll call them. A personal invitation.

11:56.620 --> 11:59.900
Mr Gordon, there was something else.

12:01.060 --> 12:05.220
Mr Keen has asked me to show
him our internal accounts.

12:06.060 --> 12:09.140
Specifically anything involving the chief.

12:10.100 --> 12:13.890
Pa's been profligate in the past, but
that's all under control now, isn't it?

12:13.940 --> 12:17.260
Personal and business
accounts are entirely separate.

12:19.700 --> 12:24.580
However, the chief does owe rather
a lot to the chairman's account.

12:29.340 --> 12:30.930
He was going to repay this.

12:30.980 --> 12:34.660
Funds were diverted to the
Whiteleys purchase by your father.

12:35.460 --> 12:38.660
The Civic might not
take a kind view of this.

12:41.220 --> 12:46.820
If Pa breaks the embargo, the Civic won't
care one jot about the chairman's account.

12:49.140 --> 12:52.500
With our support, Mr Crabb,
my father will pull this off.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.240
Let's hope he does.

13:17.420 --> 13:19.930
So... you're back.

13:19.980 --> 13:21.770
Mae.

13:21.820 --> 13:23.810
How have you been?

13:23.860 --> 13:27.090
Oh, I've been here, Harry, every day,

13:27.140 --> 13:30.660
trying to do my job while
you've been hiding away at home.

13:31.540 --> 13:36.050
And I've been stared at, gossiped about...

13:36.100 --> 13:39.970
- Don't you read the papers any more?
- I read them all.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.890
- I owe you an apology.
- Yes, you do.

13:43.900 --> 13:46.090
I blamed you for not
telling me about Jimmy.

13:46.140 --> 13:50.770
I didn't tell you because...
I just wanted to protect you.

13:50.820 --> 13:53.920
I'm sorry. Let me get
on top of things here.

13:54.260 --> 13:57.130
I promise you I will make it up to you.

14:02.700 --> 14:06.130
You can't just shut me
out when you feel like it

14:06.180 --> 14:09.380
and then expect to pick me back
up again like nothing's happened.

14:11.180 --> 14:13.460
Mae, wait...

14:17.940 --> 14:19.770
A Palm Court reception?

14:19.820 --> 14:22.410
I've got my hands pretty
full with this anniversary.

14:22.460 --> 14:25.000
It's important. Chief's orders.

14:25.820 --> 14:28.160
It will go ahead, won't it?

14:28.820 --> 14:31.890
The er... the celebrations?

14:31.940 --> 14:34.930
There are rumours among the
staff the store's in trouble.

14:34.980 --> 14:36.970
Of course it will.

14:37.020 --> 14:39.490
Oxford Street's biggest party.

14:50.660 --> 14:52.260
For me?

14:53.980 --> 14:55.780
Thank you.

14:59.540 --> 15:01.140
Wait.

15:05.140 --> 15:07.130
It's good to have you back, Mrs Grove.

15:07.180 --> 15:11.170
It's good to be back, Mr Selfridge.
It's been rather a challenging time.

15:11.220 --> 15:13.500
Mrs Grove.

15:15.780 --> 15:17.540
Please.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.960
I want you to be Deputy Manager.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.660
The job Mr Grove did so well.

15:30.340 --> 15:32.330
You're right. Times are tough.

15:32.380 --> 15:35.490
We need to build a new
team to take us forward.

15:35.540 --> 15:37.130
People look up to you.

15:37.180 --> 15:40.380
And you know better than
anyone how this place works.

15:41.660 --> 15:43.400
I-I-I couldn't.

15:46.380 --> 15:49.320
Mr Grove held you in the highest regard.

15:49.460 --> 15:53.060
And this would be your
office... if you accept.

15:56.900 --> 15:58.490
Thank you.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.220
I accept.

16:01.540 --> 16:03.880
I'll let Miss Plunkett know.

16:42.100 --> 16:46.540
You returned my flowers. I take
it my apology wasn't accepted.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.600
You already apologised.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.460
Let me...

16:58.860 --> 17:00.610
Let me take you to dinner.

17:00.660 --> 17:04.130
- We should spend some time together.
- I'm leaving, Harry.

17:04.180 --> 17:07.680
I'm selling my shares and
I'm going back to Paris.

17:07.940 --> 17:10.050
Wait. We-We have to talk.

17:10.099 --> 17:13.530
Let me just settle this
crisis at the store and...

17:13.579 --> 17:16.329
Yes and then what? There'll
always be something.

17:16.380 --> 17:18.490
That's not fair.

17:18.540 --> 17:21.250
You know how much trouble
we're in right now.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.839
I do, I'm sorry. It isn't that.

17:26.700 --> 17:28.569
When Jimmy died...

17:30.540 --> 17:32.340
.. I needed you.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.690
But you didn't need me.

17:36.740 --> 17:39.090
- No.
- And I can't live like that.

17:39.140 --> 17:41.580
Mae! Mae...

17:43.220 --> 17:44.890
.. I love you.

17:49.780 --> 17:51.380
Mae, please.

17:53.060 --> 17:55.060
Goodbye, Harry.

18:18.060 --> 18:20.850
- Good morning, Miss Adams.
- Good morning, Miss Mardle.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.570
- You're doing terrifically well.
- I'm a little nervous.

18:23.620 --> 18:25.290
It doesn't show.

18:25.340 --> 18:28.810
Rather a baptism of fire.
Starting the job with an embargo.

18:28.860 --> 18:30.730
Yes, well, I'm afraid that's not all.

18:30.780 --> 18:32.730
Late last night I received a phone call.

18:32.780 --> 18:35.410
Madame Rennard is leaving
us. Personal reasons.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.250
The chief?

18:37.300 --> 18:40.700
I had rather hoped she'd
be a permanent fixture.

18:45.860 --> 18:49.130
This suppliers' reception is this
evening, so you'll be late back.

18:49.180 --> 18:50.650
Probably.

18:50.700 --> 18:54.850
When everything is settled down,
maybe we can have some family time.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.700
See more of Mae.

18:57.660 --> 19:00.890
- She's going back to Paris.
- Why?

19:00.940 --> 19:04.140
- Did something happen? Can't
you talk to her? - I tried.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.850
Well, when is she leaving?

19:06.900 --> 19:08.500
Tonight.

19:10.140 --> 19:11.730
I have to go.

19:11.780 --> 19:13.730
Madame Rennard has left?

19:13.780 --> 19:16.770
Selfridge's will still
produce an "in-house" range.

19:16.820 --> 19:19.330
Perhaps for the slightly younger customer.

19:19.380 --> 19:21.930
- So you'll still need machinists.
- Absolutely.

19:21.980 --> 19:25.080
And I'd very much like
you to be in charge.

19:26.340 --> 19:28.130
- Me?
- Yes.

19:28.180 --> 19:31.120
Head Machinist, running the Sewing Room.

19:32.140 --> 19:34.770
I thought you were giving me notice.

19:34.820 --> 19:36.820
No.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.490
I don't think the other
girls would work to me.

19:40.540 --> 19:43.490
Well, it won't be in
their interests not to.

19:43.540 --> 19:47.140
With the right support,
nothing is insurmountable.

19:50.980 --> 19:53.130
Tell Mr Lyons I need to
meet him before lunch.

19:53.180 --> 19:56.930
Mr Selfridge, I'd like you to meet our new
Head of the Sewing Room. Miss Brockless.

19:56.980 --> 20:00.280
Madame Rennard had nothing
but praise for her.

20:01.180 --> 20:02.970
I'm glad to have you on board.

20:03.020 --> 20:05.970
Thank you... for this opportunity.

20:06.020 --> 20:08.020
It means a lot to me.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.740
You'll find the best rise to the top here.

20:18.540 --> 20:20.730
Pretty much everyone's coming.

20:20.780 --> 20:22.770
Mr Hardcastle?

20:22.820 --> 20:26.130
Took a bit of persuading, but he
finally accepted the invitation.

20:26.180 --> 20:28.170
It is a terrific idea of yours, Pa.

20:28.220 --> 20:31.340
I'm glad you're here... by my side.

20:32.220 --> 20:34.410
That's what this store
has always been about.

20:34.460 --> 20:36.650
There've been times
when I've forgotten that.

20:36.700 --> 20:40.210
And I wouldn't have blamed
you if you'd walked away.

20:40.260 --> 20:43.420
Selfridge's means just as
much to me as it does to you.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.170
Of course.

20:46.220 --> 20:48.220
Let's go.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.250
Gentlemen, great that you
could make it. Hello.

21:03.300 --> 21:06.770
Mr Selfridge, we're intrigued to hear
what you've got to say this evening.

21:06.820 --> 21:08.930
Good evening. Thank you for coming.

21:08.980 --> 21:11.690
The chief's pulled out all the stops.

21:11.740 --> 21:13.770
Lets hope he can win them over.

21:13.820 --> 21:16.610
He's the one we need to
persuade. Mr Hardcastle.

21:16.660 --> 21:19.660
Chairman of the Wholesalers' Association.

21:19.860 --> 21:22.930
Mr Hardcastle. Champagne?

21:22.980 --> 21:25.770
I wouldn't have thought
you had much to celebrate.

21:25.820 --> 21:27.810
On the contrary.

21:27.860 --> 21:31.330
We're marking a long and fruitful
relationship with our suppliers,

21:31.380 --> 21:33.850
despite current circumstances.

21:44.820 --> 21:46.610
Nearly 20 years ago,

21:46.660 --> 21:50.330
Selfridge's opened its doors
for the very first time.

21:50.380 --> 21:54.250
And we revolutionised
the world of shopping.

21:54.300 --> 21:58.730
Our anniversary celebrations will
be Oxford Street's biggest party.

21:58.780 --> 22:04.810
Customers will pour in and they will
buy your products... if they're here.

22:08.980 --> 22:11.050
Now, I know I broke your trust.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.890
Let me make amends.

22:12.940 --> 22:16.130
I'm gonna offer you something
that no other retailer can.

22:16.180 --> 22:19.940
The chance to supply both
Selfridge's and Whiteleys...

22:20.940 --> 22:23.610
with three-year fixed contracts.

22:23.660 --> 22:26.690
This deal heralds the dawn
of a new era, gentlemen.

22:26.740 --> 22:31.740
It's an opportunity like no other and
will benefit all of us for years to come.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.930
Our bills from Whiteleys remain unpaid.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.570
Gentlemen, I know.

22:37.620 --> 22:39.930
I will honour every unpaid bill in time,

22:39.980 --> 22:43.460
but you have to understand
I can't pay them right now.

22:44.900 --> 22:49.530
That is why I am offering
you this exceptional deal.

22:49.580 --> 22:52.680
Can't pay them? How
much did all this cost?

22:53.700 --> 22:56.810
Well, we wanted to show you
how valued you all are.

22:56.860 --> 22:58.450
But you won't pay us?

22:58.500 --> 23:00.090
Listen to me, Mr Hardcastle...

23:00.140 --> 23:03.340
Did you hope to dazzle
us and make us forget?

23:04.100 --> 23:06.650
We are not your customers, Mr Selfridge.

23:06.700 --> 23:09.570
We are tradesmen, businessmen.

23:09.620 --> 23:13.690
Like you, we have a workforce to pay,
premises to run, unions to contend with.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.730
Our debts must be paid.

23:15.780 --> 23:17.720
I give you my word.

23:19.060 --> 23:21.260
There will be no deal.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.170
The embargo stays.

23:43.660 --> 23:45.260
So it's true.

23:46.620 --> 23:48.360
You're leaving.

23:49.580 --> 23:54.500
Things have been very
tough for Pa recently.

23:55.540 --> 23:59.340
And I wanted to be there
with him, more than anything.

24:02.260 --> 24:05.180
Do you remember when he had that fall?

24:06.060 --> 24:08.050
Yes, of course.

24:08.100 --> 24:10.300
Oh, gosh, he nearly died.

24:10.980 --> 24:12.970
And he wouldn't see me then either.

24:13.020 --> 24:15.360
He just shuts himself away.

24:16.180 --> 24:18.780
He can't let anyone see him hurt.

24:21.380 --> 24:23.170
I'm not "anyone".

24:23.220 --> 24:28.100
I know and I've been so glad
to have you back in our lives.

24:29.140 --> 24:31.530
You're part of this family

24:31.580 --> 24:33.290
and I know Pa feels that too.

24:33.340 --> 24:35.810
And still he wouldn't let me help.

24:35.860 --> 24:39.540
Maybe he thought you wouldn't
want him if you saw him like that.

24:41.940 --> 24:44.460
He's in real trouble, Mae.

24:45.420 --> 24:50.180
Whatever he's told you,
he doesn't wanna be alone.

24:57.660 --> 24:59.260
What now?

25:02.460 --> 25:06.530
We need to pay their debts,
so... so we need a loan.

25:06.580 --> 25:08.450
The banks won't touch us.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.770
Then, what do you suggest?

25:16.380 --> 25:19.050
What about the Civic? They're
our major shareholder.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.850
Shareholders? This is
my store, my problem.

25:21.900 --> 25:25.770
- Just give me... give me time to think.
- There isn't any time.

25:25.820 --> 25:28.020
Don't you trust me?

25:29.060 --> 25:31.460
I've trusted you all my life.

25:31.900 --> 25:34.090
But you can't do this on your own.

25:34.140 --> 25:36.610
Please let someone help,
before it's too late.

25:36.660 --> 25:40.700
You didn't fight for Mae. You
need to fight for the store.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.940
Pa?

26:09.940 --> 26:11.540
Mae?

26:12.580 --> 26:14.700
Mae, are you here?

26:17.740 --> 26:19.740
Mae?

26:37.820 --> 26:41.410
It's very late, I'm... I'm sorry.

26:41.460 --> 26:44.260
Mr Gordon, what can I do for you?

26:51.020 --> 26:53.010
Yes.

26:53.060 --> 26:55.000
Yes, I'll tell him.

27:03.780 --> 27:06.050
That was the London Civic.

27:06.820 --> 27:09.920
They want you in for a
meeting. Ten o'clock.

27:23.780 --> 27:25.890
Excuse me. I'm here for a meeting.

27:25.940 --> 27:27.650
Of course. Mister...?

27:27.700 --> 27:30.690
Selfridge. Harry Selfridge.

27:30.740 --> 27:32.690
The Board are waiting for you.

27:32.740 --> 27:34.130
Chief?

27:34.180 --> 27:36.570
Mr Gordon called me.

27:36.620 --> 27:39.620
- Said I'd be needed.
- Please follow me.

27:47.780 --> 27:49.580
Mr Crabb.

28:04.420 --> 28:08.250
We understand your appeal to
the suppliers was unsuccessful.

28:08.300 --> 28:11.490
The embargo on Selfridge's
remains in place.

28:11.540 --> 28:14.940
The Civic must now take steps
to protect their interests.

28:15.740 --> 28:19.040
We will pay the suppliers'
debts at Whiteleys.

28:19.420 --> 28:23.650
This will mean considerable cost to ourselves,
but Selfridge's must continue trading.

28:23.700 --> 28:27.690
- May I ask what the terms of this loan are?
- It's not a loan.

28:27.740 --> 28:30.530
When Mr Dillon's estate is settled,

28:30.580 --> 28:34.010
you and Gordon will be the
sole owners of Whiteleys.

28:34.060 --> 28:36.010
The Civic will make you an offer for it

28:36.060 --> 28:39.360
in the understanding
that it will be accepted.

28:43.460 --> 28:46.660
You'll pay the debts
in return for Whiteleys?

28:47.860 --> 28:49.890
Hm.

28:49.940 --> 28:52.210
It seems I have no choice.

28:55.660 --> 28:57.610
There is a condition attached.

28:57.660 --> 29:01.570
You will surrender all your
shareholdings in Selfridge's to the Civic

29:01.620 --> 29:04.370
and resign as Director and Chairman.

29:04.420 --> 29:06.810
The London Civic will
work with Gordon Selfridge

29:06.860 --> 29:10.360
- to ensure the future
success of the store. - No!

29:13.180 --> 29:15.170
No, no, no.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.810
You can't fire me.

29:16.860 --> 29:21.210
Mr Selfridge, the Civic have made
every attempt to work with you,

29:21.260 --> 29:23.450
despite your extravagance
and recklessness.

29:23.500 --> 29:27.250
There are strict controls over my
expenses. Mr Crabb can confirm this.

29:27.300 --> 29:29.810
Your personal life has
always attracted attention.

29:29.860 --> 29:32.450
- Indeed, you have courted publicity.
- If you...

29:32.500 --> 29:35.090
Your recent associations
have bordered on scandalous.

29:35.140 --> 29:38.530
- The Dolly Sisters? That's over now.
- Your gambling is notorious.

29:38.580 --> 29:42.570
- I no longer gamble. - Your debts
led to a direct attack on the store.

29:42.620 --> 29:45.850
Mr Selfridge, you have dragged
down the very name of Selfridge's.

29:45.900 --> 29:49.000
- You cannot be allowed...
- That's enough!

29:51.540 --> 29:55.370
Mr Selfridge has answered
all personal criticisms.

29:55.420 --> 29:57.490
From a purely business perspective,

29:57.540 --> 30:02.370
Selfridge's has always made a healthy
profit with the chief in charge.

30:02.420 --> 30:04.930
- Surely that is what matters.
- Mr Crabb,

30:04.980 --> 30:09.820
is Mr Selfridge's financial conduct
to the store beyond reproach?

30:11.460 --> 30:16.370
I asked Mr Crabb for some internal
accounts, which were all in order.

30:16.420 --> 30:20.690
Apart from the Chairman's
account, omitted by you.

30:20.740 --> 30:23.410
Thoughtfully provided by Mr Gordon.

30:25.780 --> 30:31.170
The Chairman's account, to which
Mr Selfridge owes £118,000.

30:31.220 --> 30:34.940
Perhaps, if Mr Selfridge
could repay the sum...?

30:41.500 --> 30:43.490
I can't pay it.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.530
You know that.

30:45.580 --> 30:48.250
Everything I had was in Whiteleys.

30:49.460 --> 30:53.340
The Board will offer you a
pension of £6,000 a year.

30:54.380 --> 30:57.780
You may use the title of
President, if you wish.

30:58.260 --> 31:00.800
There will be no accountability.

31:05.100 --> 31:07.700
I built Selfridge's from nothing.

31:09.060 --> 31:13.850
That's my name -- my
name -- on that store.

31:13.900 --> 31:16.060
Our name.

31:18.100 --> 31:23.580
I'm sorry, Mr Selfridge, but
your time in charge is over.

31:58.980 --> 32:01.120
This way, Mr Selfridge.

32:23.340 --> 32:25.530
Mr Selfridge.

32:25.580 --> 32:27.720
I-I ju... I just heard.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.570
How could they?

32:38.620 --> 32:42.730
Because they're grasping,
deceitful, timid, conniving cowards.

32:42.780 --> 32:46.690
But, after everything he's done here,
what is Selfridge's without the chief?

32:46.740 --> 32:49.970
I think they had him in their
sights long before the embargo.

32:50.020 --> 32:51.610
Why, though?

32:51.660 --> 32:54.210
They have a different way of doing things.

32:54.260 --> 32:57.940
The balance sheet is king.
People are easily replaced.

32:58.860 --> 33:02.770
I-I-I know Mr Selfridge has made mistakes,
but what he's done here is extraordinary.

33:02.820 --> 33:06.020
None of them will ever
be half the man he is.

33:25.140 --> 33:28.940
This is no ordinary hole.
This is a million dollar hole.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.540
Pa?

34:40.580 --> 34:41.980
Pa?

34:47.980 --> 34:50.120
I had to save the store.

34:50.620 --> 34:53.010
Will they let you run it?

34:53.060 --> 34:55.199
Things'll be different.

34:56.139 --> 34:58.540
You did everything you could.

34:59.540 --> 35:01.970
So did I.

35:07.660 --> 35:10.850
Mr Gordon, Chief, I
thought you'd like to know

35:10.900 --> 35:13.970
stock is arriving now and
will be all through the night.

35:14.020 --> 35:17.580
The 20th anniversary celebrations
will go ahead as planned.

35:22.180 --> 35:25.620
What will you do now, Mr Crabb?

35:27.180 --> 35:34.140
I think my time is over too and
I find myself... strangely happy.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.500
If you'll excuse me, I have
one last thing to attend to.

35:49.740 --> 35:51.480
Walk with me...

35:52.380 --> 35:54.090
.. when I go.

35:54.140 --> 35:56.530
Staff need to see that we're united.

35:56.580 --> 35:58.180
Thank you.

36:00.340 --> 36:02.810
Let me know when you're ready.

36:08.540 --> 36:10.880
Tomorrow's front page, Sir.

36:17.260 --> 36:20.250
"Harry Selfridge ousted".

36:20.300 --> 36:22.820
Well, well.

36:32.820 --> 36:36.420
"The Earl of Oxford Street bows out."

37:02.180 --> 37:04.050
Mr Towler is here.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.970
Can you send Mr Gordon in?

37:12.860 --> 37:15.050
I'm very sorry to hear the news, Chief.

37:15.100 --> 37:18.570
I've come to see if there's
anything I can do to help.

37:18.620 --> 37:23.690
You have always been very
kind to me, Mr Selfridge.

37:23.740 --> 37:25.740
It's been a pleasure.

37:28.460 --> 37:31.650
- How's your son?
- Victor.

37:31.700 --> 37:35.010
- Ah! - He's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

37:35.060 --> 37:36.860
Of course he is.

37:42.620 --> 37:44.220
Let's go.

37:56.220 --> 37:58.760
The staff wanted to say goodbye.

38:00.300 --> 38:04.530
I and my family owe you
so much, Mr Selfridge.

38:04.580 --> 38:06.260
Thank you.

38:07.060 --> 38:10.160
I know the store will
be safe in your hands.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.540
I'll carry them, Mr Selfridge.
I'll be right behind you.

38:26.140 --> 38:28.250
- Thank you, Mr Selfridge.
- Mr Selfridge.

38:28.300 --> 38:30.450
Good luck, Mr Selfridge.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.850
- Bye, sir.
- Goodbye, Mr Selfridge.

38:32.900 --> 38:34.530
Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.650
Goodbye, Mr Selfridge.

39:11.580 --> 39:13.520
It looks wonderful.

39:15.380 --> 39:18.780
Selfridge's 20th anniversary.

39:26.300 --> 39:28.140
Thank you.

39:29.180 --> 39:32.090
You've all worked so hard to get us here.

39:32.140 --> 39:34.130
Thank you.

39:34.180 --> 39:39.690
Looking around, I see those who have made this
journey with us from the start, 20 years ago.

39:39.740 --> 39:42.860
Familiar faces. New faces.

39:43.900 --> 39:46.500
One generation following another.

39:48.060 --> 39:50.100
Aw!

39:51.740 --> 39:55.140
I'm proud of you all. So proud.

39:56.340 --> 39:57.930
I am just sorry

39:57.980 --> 40:01.080
that I won't be here
to share this with you.

40:01.460 --> 40:04.330
But I want you to keep the flag flying.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.420
Thank you.

40:30.180 --> 40:32.180
(Look after it.)

41:29.300 --> 41:31.100
Harry.

41:36.540 --> 41:38.130
I thought you had gone.

41:38.180 --> 41:40.180
Here I am.

41:47.820 --> 41:49.420
I'm so sorry.

41:54.260 --> 41:56.250
The store was my life.

41:56.300 --> 41:59.820
I wish it hadn't ended this way,
but you are so much more than this.

42:01.300 --> 42:03.770
I've lost everything.

42:03.820 --> 42:06.490
No, you're still Harry Selfridge...

42:07.940 --> 42:09.810
.. and I love you.

42:16.860 --> 42:19.650
So I have some plans.

42:19.700 --> 42:22.810
Erm, Paris, Rome...

42:22.860 --> 42:27.940
Well, anywhere, really,
if you'll come with me.

42:41.220 --> 42:43.620
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.

42:44.700 --> 42:47.100
Well, then call it "luck".
