41:24.850 --> 41:27.385
I feel like such a coward
for sending you to see them.

41:27.452 --> 41:31.356
No. No. You were right.

41:31.422 --> 41:33.825
They said some things
you couldn't say.

41:36.094 --> 41:38.964
Carson told me you came up
to propose to me.

41:40.098 --> 41:43.334
- Yeah, that's right.
- What scared you off?

41:43.401 --> 41:45.070
He told me to leave.
Well, sure.

41:45.136 --> 41:47.939
He thought you were
a fortune hunter.

41:48.006 --> 41:52.077
You could've told him
who you were, couldn't you?

41:52.143 --> 41:53.979
What scared you off?

41:57.115 --> 41:58.984
[ Exhales ]

42:00.652 --> 42:03.221
We're from--

42:03.288 --> 42:05.857
We're from such different
worlds, you know?

42:05.924 --> 42:07.726
Uh-huh.

42:07.793 --> 42:10.562
We're from
two different worlds.

42:10.629 --> 42:12.530
You mean,
I grew up wealthy?

42:12.598 --> 42:15.266
Yeah, I suppose.

42:15.333 --> 42:18.737
Well, then you tell me
if you gauge people
on how much money they make.

42:19.605 --> 42:22.307
Do you?
No.

42:22.373 --> 42:25.210
When you're on a mission,

42:25.276 --> 42:27.078
do you think
about money?

42:27.145 --> 42:29.648
No.
Well, that's all
it means to be rich.

42:29.715 --> 42:32.651
That's all it means.

42:32.718 --> 42:34.620
Look, Carson said
he wanted to protect you.

42:34.686 --> 42:37.322
Well, of course he did.
He loves me.

42:40.358 --> 42:42.260
You love me?
Yes.

42:43.862 --> 42:45.764
I do.

42:46.765 --> 42:49.000
But look, I wanted
to protect you too.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.336
Well, good.

42:51.402 --> 42:54.906
Because that's
what every girl wants
in a husband--

42:56.708 --> 42:58.810
someone like you.

42:59.811 --> 43:02.113
Don't you know that?

43:03.715 --> 43:05.784
Don't you know that?

43:08.920 --> 43:11.790
You have anything you want
to say to me, soldier?

43:16.161 --> 43:18.029
Will you marry me?

43:19.497 --> 43:21.933
It would be my pleasure
and my honor.
