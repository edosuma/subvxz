WEBVTT

01:12.489 --> 01:13.866
Your turn.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.744
Oh, fuck.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.633
Okay, I'm awake.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.564
Good morning.

01:43.729 --> 01:46.448
You guys are up
a little early today, huh.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.443
Did we have some
nightmares or something?

01:52.029 --> 01:53.906
Let's see what
you made for daddy.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.073
Let's see.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.875
I wouldn't like to sleep
with that in my pants, either.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.298
But it did happen
once in college.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.048
Can you leave that
bottle alone, honey?

02:07.210 --> 02:08.586
Can you put it down?

02:09.713 --> 02:11.807
Honey... Sarah...

02:11.965 --> 02:13.967
No, no! Sweetheart!

02:14.134 --> 02:15.260
Damn.

02:16.595 --> 02:20.566
I know. I'll have you back in your
warm little bed in one second.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.601
Here you go.
Back to bed, sweetheart.

02:22.768 --> 02:24.611
You got a fresh, dry diapy.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.568
Peter...

02:26.730 --> 02:28.232
Peter, please!

02:28.732 --> 02:31.736
Buddy, we talked
about the head thing.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.410
Let me get you all hooked up.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.079
Hang on, don't fall.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.338
Oh, no.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.426
Peter... Oh.

03:09.940 --> 03:13.285
Okay. A little
something for daddy.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.634
Steel, Kuhbach, McCloud Law Firm.
Good morning.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.097
Good morning, Lockwood.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.936
Good morning, Mr. Steel.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.475
Thank you.

03:44.808 --> 03:45.980
How are the kids?

03:46.184 --> 03:47.811
Oh, they're terrific.
Just terrific.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.195
Children are such a joy.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.776
Yes, absolutely.
Always.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.483
Any word on
the Amalgamated merger?

03:52.649 --> 03:53.821
That's all but signed.

03:53.984 --> 03:57.033
And just in time for your
partner review, no less.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.706
Really? Oh,
I hadn't noticed.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.825
I look forward to having
your antic sense of humor

04:01.908 --> 04:03.831
in the partner suite, Lockwood.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.167
It can get a touch dry up there.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.165
Thank you so much.
Hmm.

04:08.457 --> 04:09.629
But a Double Windsor?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.674
Come on, son.
This is not the dog track.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.845
No. Yes.

04:13.920 --> 04:14.921
Yeah.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.349
Absolutely not.
Thank you.

04:17.466 --> 04:18.466
Hi.

04:18.507 --> 04:20.351
Seriously,
Dave, this isn't the dog track.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.179
Yeah.
Good morning, Sabrina.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.673
Last week he told me my shoes
were dangerously Italian.

04:24.681 --> 04:25.682
What?

04:26.099 --> 04:27.476
My turn with
the Amalgamated files?

04:27.642 --> 04:30.441
Yeah, I adjusted the WACC to reflect
the new monthly projections,

04:30.604 --> 04:34.199
and I pre-negotiated
articles 23 through 29.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.363
Okay.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.285
I like the way you had
it before, by the way.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.037
Yeah. Thank you.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.053
Good morning, Patricia.

04:58.969 --> 04:59.969
Hello.

04:59.993 --> 05:02.167
Penis, shit,
vagina, cock, wolf pussies.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.100
Mitch. I'm at work.

05:04.596 --> 05:05.865
- Did I get you?
- Yeah. You sure did.

05:05.889 --> 05:06.991
- You got me on speakerphone?
- Yep.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.141
Did the secretary hear?

05:08.225 --> 05:10.319
Yes, the secretary heard.
She heard it all.

05:10.977 --> 05:11.978
That's awesome.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.156
Not really.
How stoned are you right now?

05:14.231 --> 05:15.232
I've taken some weed.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.357
- Have you?
- Mmm-hmm.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.367
- Do you know what time it is?
- Mmm-mmm.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.569
It's like 9:00.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.071
Holy fuck-knuckles.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.616
Guess what I'm looking at right now.
A bong?

05:23.740 --> 05:26.414
No, I found a futon on
the street last night.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.580
I sort of had to fight a bum for it.
He was so thin.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.340
And it also came with this
vintage Navajo pony blanket...

05:32.499 --> 05:34.342
So I think that's
pretty much a win for me.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.354
Mitch, you know the adults are
about to fire up a work day.

05:36.378 --> 05:39.222
- I know, I just miss you, dude, that's all.
- I miss you, too.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.234
We've been super best
buddies since third grade.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.458
I haven't seen you in forever.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.556
Oh, I've been swamped.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.877
We're sleep-training the twins,

05:44.886 --> 05:46.113
and I just haven't
had a moment to breathe.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.105
I'm sorry, man.
I'm just super-excited to see you.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.687
We are still on
for tonight, right?

05:51.184 --> 05:52.652
- David?
- Yep.

05:52.811 --> 05:55.781
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
For the thingy.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.692
Braves-Marlins.
Please don't tell me that you forgot.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.031
Didn't forget.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.587
What time are you
going to pick me up?

06:01.611 --> 06:02.713
Don't you bail on me, David.

06:02.737 --> 06:03.738
I am not going to bail.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.374
If you bail on me, I'm going
to literally eye-rape you.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.580
I got it.

06:07.659 --> 06:11.584
I will actually place myself
inside your ocular... Oh!

06:11.663 --> 06:12.755
It's my dad.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.087
Mitch Planko, Sr.
Making a rare appearance.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.048
This guy fucking hates me.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.262
I'll pick you up at 6:00.
Got it.

06:19.421 --> 06:20.468
Kirk out.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.596
Dad.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.139
What are you doing here?

06:25.552 --> 06:26.804
Oh, I just came by to tell you

06:26.887 --> 06:29.436
how incredibly proud
of you I am, son.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.892
I'm pretty baked right now,

06:31.975 --> 06:33.943
but I think you're
being sarcastic.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.066
Right?

06:35.145 --> 06:36.385
No, dropping out of high school

06:36.438 --> 06:38.190
to be an actor was
a great decision.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.784
I saw you in that commercial
for meat, incidentally.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.821
That was the most brilliant portrayal
of baloney I have ever seen.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.196
Why are you here?

06:45.363 --> 06:47.832
Just came by to see if you'd
like to have some breakfast.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.915
I can't. I got a super-duper important
conference call in 10 minutes.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.421
- You don't have a job.
- You don't have any hair.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.627
Right.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.050
Well, then I'll just
say it here.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.585
I'm getting married again,

06:58.668 --> 07:01.467
and I'd like you to
come to the wedding.

07:04.049 --> 07:06.347
- When's the wedding?
- Next Saturday.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.270
My betrothed, Pamela,
would like you

07:09.346 --> 07:11.269
to be there to say a few words.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.433
I'll catch the next one.

07:14.517 --> 07:18.772
Yeah, right. Okay, well,
then I'd better get home

07:19.606 --> 07:21.108
and boil my shoes.

07:21.650 --> 07:24.278
- Great visiting.
- You, too.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.999
Good.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.130
And the baby-eating monster

07:39.292 --> 07:42.592
rises from the deep!

07:45.590 --> 07:47.718
Hey, Daddy, which one
do you like better?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.137
The southern monarch or
the many-spotted skipperling?

07:50.303 --> 07:54.399
I am a many-spotted
skipperling man, all the way.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.276
The monarch is just a glorified
moth, don't you think?

07:57.435 --> 07:59.153
Yes. I tend to agree.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.574
- Hi, Mom!
- Hi!

08:02.649 --> 08:03.696
What a bad, bad day.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.192
Hi.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.739
The zoning board shut us
down for the millionth time.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.704
Dr. Klein lost the twins'
immunization records.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.914
And Cara got bullied
in ballet class again.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.420
Did you tell Daddy?

08:15.578 --> 08:19.128
Nicolette Peters keeps knocking me
over during the battement glissÃ©.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.839
Oh, I'm sorry, sugarbug.
Are you okay?

08:22.544 --> 08:25.718
We just need to keep
striving for verbal resolution.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.759
Yeah, yeah.
Verbal resolution, sweetheart.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.261
So where do you want
to do this tonight?

08:31.428 --> 08:32.429
Do what?

08:33.096 --> 08:34.438
Dialogue Night.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.395
Oh, my God.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.317
Honey...

08:38.393 --> 08:39.610
Don't even say that.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.615
I'm so sorry. I suck.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.868
Dr. Tillman said just once
a week, for one hour.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.028
I'm sorry.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.617
That was three months ago.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.406
I know. I heard her.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.951
And I want to sit and
talk with you for an hour

08:54.117 --> 08:56.961
more than once a week,
but tonight, I cannot.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.372
Why? What are you doing?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.165
I promised Mitch
I would sit and watch

09:00.248 --> 09:01.392
a game with him tonight, and...

09:01.416 --> 09:02.416
What?

09:02.459 --> 09:05.463
Can we please just slide
the Dialogue Night again?

09:05.545 --> 09:06.546
I'm so sorry.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.134
I can do Monday night.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.143
Thank you.

09:12.761 --> 09:13.842
He's early.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.563
Yeah, you'd be early, too,

09:15.638 --> 09:18.061
if all you did all day
was eat hummus and masturbate.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.233
What's hummus?

09:19.392 --> 09:21.486
That is a Mediterranean
spread, honey.

09:21.644 --> 09:22.896
What's master-ate?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.610
It's a cracker.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.780
Oh, hey, Mitch.
Your hair looks good.

09:27.942 --> 09:28.989
Thanks.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.281
Yeah, I had to cut it for a
fucking tampon commercial.

09:32.447 --> 09:33.494
Uncle Mitch!

09:33.573 --> 09:35.871
How's my favorite
ballerina doing?

09:35.950 --> 09:38.169
- Hi, Uncle Mitch.
- Hi! Wow!

09:38.495 --> 09:40.668
Gosh, you're so light.
Are you dieting?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.582
Do you want to come
to my dance recital?

09:42.791 --> 09:43.883
Oh!

09:44.084 --> 09:46.007
No, honey.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.171
The only style of dancing
that Uncle Mitch likes

09:48.338 --> 09:51.808
involves a big, shiny pole, and a
broken woman with daddy issues.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.473
Yeah, story time is over.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.183
Go fix your hair.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.263
Ow.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.141
Mmm, smells good in here, Jame.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.225
Mmm.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.314
Ooh! Num-nums!

10:02.936 --> 10:04.028
Vegetable medley!

10:04.187 --> 10:06.189
- How are you?
- Good.

10:06.356 --> 10:07.699
- You're good?
- Yeah.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.200
Are you dating anyone?

10:09.359 --> 10:10.861
- Ooh! You know who I ran into?
- Who?

10:11.194 --> 10:13.868
Mrs. Hickham at a
Starbucks in Druid Hills.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.828
- Our social studies teacher?
- Yeah.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.676
I asked her out and she
wouldn't go out with me,

10:17.700 --> 10:19.740
which is crazy, because I
nailed her in high school.

10:19.828 --> 10:20.438
You did?

10:20.463 --> 10:22.901
I dated her mouth for
a full semester.

10:23.498 --> 10:27.048
Okay.
Bathed, diapered, and in the PJs.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.546
Is Dave meeting
your needs, sexually?

10:30.171 --> 10:32.299
- Yeah, I guess.
- Good.

10:32.882 --> 10:33.883
Not really, mmm-mmm.
Ahh.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.015
I would like to strap you to
my face and say the alphabet.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.313
That's going too far.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.606
Oh!

10:41.057 --> 10:44.903
Look at these little fuckers!

10:46.354 --> 10:48.527
What's your name? Hey.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.034
What's your name?
What's your name?

10:51.192 --> 10:53.536
Why can't they talk yet?
Are they retarded or something?

10:53.695 --> 10:54.935
Don't say...
You can't say that.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.494
Well, this one right here
looks a little Downsy.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.830
- Or that.
- I'm kidding.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.370
- A little bit, though?
- No.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.737
Pumpkin, we'll see you
right after the game, okay?

11:03.746 --> 11:04.838
Have fun.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.250
I like it. Oh, God.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.011
- Let's go.
- Okay. Bye.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.432
Mitch and Dave.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.719
Mitch and Dave, out on the town.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.683
Oh, dude, I didn't tell you!

11:18.845 --> 11:20.438
I booked a major
movie role this week.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.740
I auditioned for
a movie role, I got it.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.884
- Yeah, first one.
- Hey, good for you. What is it called?

11:23.892 --> 11:25.565
Untitled Awesome Movie.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.274
Truly? That's the name?

11:27.437 --> 11:28.939
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Good for you.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.199
- Do you want to hotbox this nut sack?
- No, no.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.878
- I've got a big day tomorrow.
- Take the wheel. Steer. Steering wheel.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.028
Oh, steer for me.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.697
Mitch, come on, buddy.

11:36.863 --> 11:40.083
Let's make it to the game in
one piece, don't you think?

11:40.241 --> 11:43.120
Want to try that?
This Fiero, unfortunately, is airbag-free.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.412
It's a work day tomorrow.

11:44.579 --> 11:47.298
- Come on.
- All right, I'll take one hit.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.759
Oh! What the...
You motherfucker!

11:49.918 --> 11:51.215
Let's just focus on the driving.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.256
Just say no, Reagan.
God, why would you do that?

11:54.422 --> 11:55.924
Well, we're driving.
God!

11:56.090 --> 11:58.468
This is a car carrying a lot of speed.
This is terrible.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.138
Hit the steering wheel.
I'm going again!

12:07.894 --> 12:08.977
Whoo! Drink!

12:08.978 --> 12:11.606
I'll drink to that. All right!
That was a strikeout.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.368
Huh, what's going on?
It is good to see you again.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.987
It's good to see you, too, Dave.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.553
What's going on
with the women, huh?

12:18.613 --> 12:21.583
I've been seeing a number
of very, very nice ladies.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.414
- I got some pictures.
- Wow.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.004
That is Tatiana.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.335
Tatiana.

12:28.498 --> 12:29.624
What's her last name?

12:29.791 --> 12:33.841
It's Tatiana Calls-me-at-three-in-the-morning-
and-wants-to-fuck-stein.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.883
Who gives a shit what her last name is?

12:36.005 --> 12:38.508
Mitch. Reminds me
a little bit of Sabrina.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.348
Yeah! Wait,
who's Sabrina?

12:40.510 --> 12:43.013
Sabrina. She's this...

12:43.179 --> 12:45.352
She's this new law
associate at my work.

12:45.515 --> 12:48.394
She's so hot.
Oh, Mitch, is she hot. Uh-oh.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.146
She's like fall-out-of-a-magazine
hot, you know?

12:51.312 --> 12:53.207
I bet she's number one
on your cancer list, right?

12:53.231 --> 12:54.232
What is that?

12:54.315 --> 12:55.834
- Come on, you know what that is.
- What is that?

12:55.858 --> 12:57.280
Every married guy
has a cancer list.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.004
It's the first three women
you'd have sex with

12:59.028 --> 13:00.468
if your wife suddenly
died of cancer.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.203
That's fucking sick.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.592
Come on.
That's the mother of my children.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.617
Oh, I know.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.204
But I'll play.
Yes, she'd be at the top of that list.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.542
- It's like a gift.
- Yeah.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.878
But I interrupted you.
Tell me about this one again.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.759
God, last week,
Tatiana, she comes over,

13:14.085 --> 13:15.646
she's wearing this
tight black mini-dress,

13:15.670 --> 13:16.950
and you know
what she says to me?

13:17.005 --> 13:18.382
Tell me slow.
No, nothing.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.668
Because all Tatiana wants to
do at 3:00 in the morning

13:20.717 --> 13:22.765
is fucky, fucky, rubber ducky.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.350
This chick is insatiable!

13:25.513 --> 13:27.891
She wants it in every
position under the sun.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.274
God, you're so lucky.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.857
We do the Wheelbarrow,
the Arabian Goggles,

13:32.020 --> 13:34.273
the Lonesome Dove,
the Arsenio Hall,

13:34.439 --> 13:37.568
the Jelly Donut, the Pastrami
Sandwich, the Wolfgang Puck...

13:37.734 --> 13:39.814
And let me tell you something,
no man is that hungry.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.422
What? I don't even
know what these are.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.590
- You're married. You're married, Dave.
- That's true.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.082
Anyway, we start going at it

13:45.366 --> 13:48.040
and it gets so intense
that my nose starts bleeding.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.166
Come on.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.668
This is Dracula,
Anne Rice-type shit

13:51.748 --> 13:52.948
happening right in front of me.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.004
Good for you.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.603
When all is said and done, when we
finish up, and the dust settles,

13:56.627 --> 13:58.254
she looks up at me,
and she says,

13:58.421 --> 14:02.801
"Mitchell, next Tuesday,
I am coming back here,"

14:02.967 --> 14:05.095
"and we're
really going to fuck."

14:05.595 --> 14:06.767
Yes!

14:06.929 --> 14:09.432
Yes! Tatiana.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.727
Fuck. Mitch, Mitch, Mitch.

14:11.893 --> 14:12.940
You're just...

14:13.394 --> 14:14.737
How did I miss this?

14:14.896 --> 14:17.945
I missed all the sex and the
drugs and the bad choices,

14:18.107 --> 14:21.077
and I just fucking rushed it, didn't I?
Wasn't I rushing?

14:21.152 --> 14:22.244
You were busy.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.922
Rushing to get into
a good college, right?

14:23.946 --> 14:25.368
And then into a good law school.

14:25.448 --> 14:26.791
Once I got into
a good law school,

14:26.908 --> 14:28.260
I just wanted to get
into a good law firm.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.565
I met Jamie, we got married,
we had Cara, and that was it.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.965
I pissed away my 20s, right?
Now it's too late.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.759
Look, shitbird.
You got it made!

14:36.918 --> 14:38.841
You have an extremely hot wife,

14:39.003 --> 14:40.926
and you got a beautiful house

14:41.089 --> 14:44.093
that's full of furniture
and food and kids.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.510
And you make a ton of money.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.349
And you come home
at the end of the day

14:47.512 --> 14:50.607
and you're surrounded by people
who give a shit about you.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.109
You're never lonely.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.314
What more do you want?

14:54.477 --> 14:56.070
I'll tell you what I want, okay?

14:56.145 --> 14:57.362
I want something different.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.198
I want your life, you know?

14:59.357 --> 15:02.031
I want Sabrina.
I want Tatiana.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.616
And sex with strange, new women.

15:04.779 --> 15:05.780
You're living the dream.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.541
How much fun is it being an
actor, working one week a year?

15:08.699 --> 15:11.202
I want to smoke weed all day.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.339
I want to start a book
that I actually finish.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.670
I would like to take
a nice, solid dump

15:16.791 --> 15:18.919
because I'm not
constantly stressed out.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.838
I want to learn
how to rollerblade.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.024
And I'd like to take a piss.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.800
Me, too.
Fountain, fountain, fountain.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.180
Perfect.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.187
Whoo!

15:40.731 --> 15:43.450
This chick does not look happy.

15:43.526 --> 15:46.450
I was just saying that
I really envy your life.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.649
- That's all.
- I envy yours.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.540
No, you don't. You're
just trying to be nice.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.292
I'm not.
I do, I envy it.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.873
No. I envy yours.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.037
I wish I had your life.

16:17.435 --> 16:18.982
It's rolling
blackouts or something?

16:19.145 --> 16:20.397
Yeah, I guess.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.819
Look at your flow,
it's so nice and thick.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.028
It's confident.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.157
Yours is very steamy.
Thanks.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.329
My urologist says
I run a little hot.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.789
- Good to go?
- Oh, yeah.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.625
- Can you drive?
- Oh, yeah!

16:59.143 --> 17:00.645
Holy fuck-knuckles!

17:00.811 --> 17:02.984
Where is my bong?

17:04.982 --> 17:07.451
Whose fucking kid is that?

17:08.152 --> 17:11.156
What is with all
these goddamn pillows?

17:15.952 --> 17:17.625
Jamie! Jesus!

17:17.828 --> 17:19.922
What?
That's fucking disgusting!

17:20.080 --> 17:22.425
Put those tits away,
this isn't Africa!

17:22.625 --> 17:25.127
What am I doing in this bed?
Did I sleep here last night?

17:25.294 --> 17:26.921
Did I fucking nail you?

17:27.128 --> 17:28.472
Are you still drunk?

17:30.341 --> 17:31.342
Dave!

17:32.301 --> 17:33.769
Where is Lockwood?

17:37.682 --> 17:39.810
What the fuck?

17:39.976 --> 17:42.149
Oh, my God.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.813
I'm Dave?

17:47.108 --> 17:48.485
Oh, my God!

17:55.324 --> 17:57.543
Open the goddamn door, Dave.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.293
Come on, open up the
door, right now.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.547
Fuck.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.963
Come on, buddy,
open up the door immediately.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.719
Let's do it.

18:08.713 --> 18:11.341
Dave, come on.
Open up the door, right now!

18:13.050 --> 18:15.223
- Okay, I'm awake.
- Open up this fucking door!

18:24.020 --> 18:25.488
Open the goddamn door, Dave!

18:25.563 --> 18:26.564
Mitch?

18:27.231 --> 18:28.858
Why am I in your apartment?

18:29.525 --> 18:31.086
Dave, hurry up,
open up the door!

18:33.904 --> 18:36.064
Something very bad has happened.
Wait until you see me.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.968
- Wait until you see you!
- Jesus Christ, relax.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.040
Super freaky, dude.
Let's do it!

18:41.537 --> 18:42.789
Oh.

18:44.832 --> 18:45.879
What the hell is this?

18:46.417 --> 18:49.512
I knew it.
Oh, my God.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.674
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck is this?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.347
Look at this.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.221
Yeah, it's you.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.683
And this is all me.
All of this shit is mine.

19:02.850 --> 19:03.897
You're welcome.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.107
I got this.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.395
What are you doing to me?

19:06.562 --> 19:08.906
Hey, stop it.
I'm so strong.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.862
You're choking yourself!

19:11.025 --> 19:12.777
Must wake up.

19:12.943 --> 19:13.990
Wake up!

19:14.070 --> 19:16.118
I can't breathe.
Take my hands off you.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.541
- Wake up!
- Get the fuck off me!

19:21.744 --> 19:23.087
Okay, okay, okay!

19:23.663 --> 19:25.586
Go look
in the mirror. Right there!

19:27.958 --> 19:28.959
All right?

19:30.753 --> 19:31.834
I'm a douche bag.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.514
I'm a fucking tool!

19:34.256 --> 19:35.257
Oh! What did you do?

19:35.424 --> 19:36.902
What did I do?
You think I want to be you?

19:36.926 --> 19:38.178
Who said I wanted to be you?

19:39.887 --> 19:41.764
Holy shit, we did.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.409
We wished for each other's lives

19:44.433 --> 19:46.902
when we were pissing in that
fucking fountain last night.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.461
We wished we had
each other's lives.

19:48.562 --> 19:49.779
I was just trying to be nice!

19:49.939 --> 19:51.566
Oh, my God!

19:52.233 --> 19:53.780
I know a shortcut to the fountain.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.365
Go this way.

19:57.571 --> 19:58.618
Careful! Easy.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.283
I got it.
I got it.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.686
What are we going to do
when we get to the fountain?

20:10.710 --> 20:11.895
We're going to take
a piss in it, or...

20:11.919 --> 20:14.297
I don't give a shit.
We're gonna get our lives back.

20:17.299 --> 20:18.642
You've got to be kidding me.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.315
Hey, where is the fountain?

20:24.724 --> 20:25.725
It is getting restored.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.370
- What are you talking about, restored?
- Where did you take it?

20:28.394 --> 20:29.913
I don't know, guy,
I just fill the hole.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.177
I'm not the fountain spokesman.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.073
Hey, motherfucker...

20:33.232 --> 20:34.872
Whoa, whoa, who could
tell us where it is?

20:35.651 --> 20:36.903
Maybe ask the district manager.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.339
Nope. It is not
in the computer.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.809
Okay, when will it
be in the computer?

20:59.967 --> 21:01.969
Maybe tomorrow.
That's when Victor gets back.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.780
It's not in the computer,
it's not in the park.

21:03.804 --> 21:04.851
Who is Victor?

21:04.930 --> 21:07.353
The guy that knows how to
find shit in the computer.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.234
How can you lose a fountain?

21:09.351 --> 21:11.621
- This is a big deal to us, okay?
- I mean, it's a fountain!

21:11.645 --> 21:14.023
- Can you look a little bit harder?
- That's incredible!

21:14.190 --> 21:15.533
It is not in the computer.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.035
Yeah, but your attitude
is right on your shoulders.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.491
No, no, no!

21:19.653 --> 21:21.200
There was no physical contact.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.957
We're okay. We're fine.
We're fine.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.137
I have the biggest meeting in my life
in 45 minutes. This isn't happening.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.513
Did you have something
you wanted to do today?

21:28.537 --> 21:30.057
I've got day one of
my big break movie.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.379
If I don't make this meeting,
I don't make partner,

21:32.541 --> 21:34.770
and the last 15 years of my life,
everything I've done, wasted!

21:34.794 --> 21:35.914
All right, fine, I'll do it.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.389
I've got it.
I'll do it.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.054
- I got you.
- Do what?

21:41.217 --> 21:42.389
I'm an actor.
Human chameleon.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.112
I can do lawyer in my fucking sleep.
Give me the keys.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.697
Oh, you'll play me
in one of your productions?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.157
- Yeah, give me the keys.
- Okay, no.

21:47.181 --> 21:49.309
- Why?
- Because you're...

21:49.391 --> 21:50.483
Careful.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.789
Because there's more to being a lawyer
than what you see on TV, Mitch.

21:53.813 --> 21:54.814
- Is there?
- Yeah.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.153
- I object!
- Oh, my God.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.488
- Okay?
- No!

21:58.651 --> 22:01.412
Wrong, my friend. You don't know the
first thing about being a lawyer.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.650
You're not a trained actor.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.910
Neither are you.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.325
Save it, all right, Dave?

22:05.407 --> 22:06.635
It's one day.
We're Mitch and Dave!

22:06.659 --> 22:08.539
We can do one day of anything.
Give me the keys.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.372
Let's go.
Do you have a better plan?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.378
Shit. Okay. All right.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.339
- You've got 41 minutes, okay?
- Great!

22:15.501 --> 22:17.879
Go to my house, get
dressed in my clothes.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.844
Then you go to my office, find
my legal associate, Sabrina.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.599
Get the merger
documents from her,

22:22.675 --> 22:24.518
take them to
the conference room, and...

22:24.677 --> 22:26.238
Oh, God, the partners
are going to be there.

22:26.262 --> 22:29.607
Listen, do not say
a single word.

22:29.765 --> 22:30.909
What if somebody
asks me a question?

22:30.933 --> 22:32.573
They're not going to
ask you a damn thing.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.579
Once the meeting starts, you
will continue to say nothing.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.523
When a partner asks you
for the merger documents,

22:36.564 --> 22:39.443
you will then
silently hand them over.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.419
I get it. Play it big,
but maintain my reality.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.754
- It's pretty simple.
- No! You play it small.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.155
I have spent
the last nine months

22:44.238 --> 22:45.599
banging out
the terms of this deal.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.926
The only thing you have to do is
hand over the documents, that's it.

22:47.950 --> 22:48.951
Dude, easy as fuck.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.198
You can't say things like
that in the meeting, Mitch.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.288
True. Good note.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.923
For me, you go to my house, okay?
All my info is on my fridge.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.082
When you get to the set,
you go to hair and makeup,

22:57.084 --> 22:58.085
and you learn your lines.

22:58.252 --> 23:00.596
Most of all, do not fuck
this up for me, all right?

23:00.754 --> 23:03.633
This is my big break, my Raging Bull.
Do you hear me?

23:03.799 --> 23:05.767
You respect my art,
you respect my life.

23:05.926 --> 23:06.927
You respect mine.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.974
Yeah, I got you. Power hug.
Come on. Yeah, okay.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.646
Hold on.
You got to pick up Cara.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.810
Pick up Cara from
ballet at 4:00, okay?

23:14.977 --> 23:16.320
I am fucking all over that shit.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.071
Holy shit.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.505
Early morning on the
golf course, Lockwood?

23:34.663 --> 23:36.290
Ha-ha! Terrific!

23:45.841 --> 23:47.013
Num-nums!

23:47.426 --> 23:49.019
Fucking score!

23:49.428 --> 23:51.146
Fucking grocery store.

23:52.264 --> 23:56.144
Look at all of this
for little Mitchie-poo.

23:56.685 --> 23:57.777
Nice!

23:58.562 --> 23:59.859
Oh, there you are.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.658
I redid the 10-19 variants,
everything else is the same. Ready?

24:03.525 --> 24:05.027
Oh, you must be Sabrina, huh?

24:05.861 --> 24:06.953
You must be Dave.

24:07.029 --> 24:09.007
Are we role-playing or something?
Because we're late.

24:09.031 --> 24:11.111
He didn't tell me you were
a big, fat, fucking boner.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.791
Sorry. That was unprofessional.
Wasn't it?

24:15.204 --> 24:17.548
Dave have a mimosa for breakfast?
A little nervous?

24:17.706 --> 24:18.707
That was a joke. Hey...

24:18.874 --> 24:20.914
I've got one really important
question before we go.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.886
All this food here, is it free?

24:25.506 --> 24:26.507
You got this.

24:26.674 --> 24:27.675
Yeah, I got it.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.847
I got it. Okay.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.010
Let's do this.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.721
All right.
You remember though?

24:31.887 --> 24:34.106
Oh, right.
It's down there. Got it.

24:54.785 --> 24:56.628
- Lockwood.
- Yep.

24:57.579 --> 25:00.378
Perhaps you would like to sit
on our side of the table.

25:02.751 --> 25:03.877
Thanks.

25:09.091 --> 25:11.264
Now, before we
formalize this merger,

25:11.427 --> 25:15.148
are there any outstanding
questions we might address?

25:15.764 --> 25:17.311
Our back-of-the-envelope
analysis.

25:17.766 --> 25:21.441
Shows your
P&L to be 2% less than expected

25:21.603 --> 25:22.775
as per the MAC clause.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.778
Can I get confirmation
that the EBITDA

25:25.941 --> 25:28.160
still aligns with comfortable...

25:29.278 --> 25:30.279
Dave?

25:32.573 --> 25:34.792
- Dave!
- Yes. Dave is here.

25:37.286 --> 25:38.287
Hey, man.

25:38.412 --> 25:39.459
Hey.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.127
Oh, I've got your thing.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.542
Boom!

25:43.959 --> 25:45.632
No, Dave, uh...

25:45.794 --> 25:49.515
Mr. Kinkabe had a question
about the EBITDA.

25:54.470 --> 25:55.471
Okay.

25:58.474 --> 25:59.475
Uh, how is it?

26:03.145 --> 26:04.146
Good.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.483
Good?

26:09.151 --> 26:10.368
What am I saying?

26:10.527 --> 26:12.154
EBITDA is bad.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.372
Fucking terrible.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.703
Are you saying the premium
needs to be adjusted?

26:19.036 --> 26:20.037
I didn't say that.

26:20.204 --> 26:21.956
Did you hear
me say it? Nope.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.123
What about our WACC?

26:23.707 --> 26:25.584
- Huh?
- What PPS multiple are you using?

26:25.667 --> 26:27.669
- What's that?
- Is the financing still stable?

26:27.753 --> 26:28.800
Hang on, guys.

26:28.879 --> 26:31.723
Fucking 25 guys on this side.
Can you fire at somebody else?

26:31.882 --> 26:33.401
Can anybody else
field the fucking question?

26:33.425 --> 26:35.098
- Dave?
- Yep.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.683
It's your job to know this.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.853
Yeah, and I know that.

26:40.224 --> 26:43.273
You know, we're...
Everything is...

26:44.019 --> 26:45.020
Here is the deal.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.948
We are very rich.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.905
Everybody rich!

26:50.943 --> 26:52.570
So let's sign this.

26:52.736 --> 26:55.535
What's the worst
that can happen? Right?

26:55.697 --> 26:57.995
We will just roll this party out

26:58.117 --> 27:00.415
to some sushi and
some sake bombs.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.706
Moustache is buying.
And then a little karaoke for dessert?

27:03.872 --> 27:05.044
What have we got to lose?

27:05.207 --> 27:08.051
Let's bones that.
Huh, 'stache?

27:08.210 --> 27:09.587
Is this some kind of joke?

27:10.045 --> 27:11.422
Are you trying to
poison the well?

27:11.588 --> 27:13.636
You are the one on a fishing
expedition, Kinkabe.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.722
You were never serious
about this merger.

27:15.801 --> 27:16.848
Me?

27:16.927 --> 27:19.555
This moron works for you.
You are the one sabotaging it.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.769
Fuck you with that...
"Moron" is a bad word here.

27:21.932 --> 27:22.933
This merger is over.

27:23.100 --> 27:26.320
You have just made the biggest
mistake of your career, mister.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.071
- I will see you in court.
- No, no.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.483
What a bunch of bullshit!

27:31.400 --> 27:32.902
Hang on.
Don't get up.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.241
Is this a break?
Taking a break?

27:36.071 --> 27:37.288
Quick fiver?

27:39.408 --> 27:40.580
What the hell was that?

27:40.742 --> 27:42.995
Relax. This is good.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.414
Look at how great this is.

27:44.580 --> 27:48.084
It's all part of my
secret master plan.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.752
- It is?
- You bet.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.318
You are hurting my
arm a little bit.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.800
This deal is critical to the
very survival of this firm.

27:55.966 --> 27:57.309
- Is that clear?
- I got it.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.887
I know what I'm doing.
I've been doing it for...

27:59.970 --> 28:01.489
How long have I
been doing it here, huh?

28:01.513 --> 28:03.311
How long have I worked here?
You know that.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.645
I don't know.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.564
- Nine years, 10.
- Yeah.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.941
Yeah. Perfect.
Exactly 10 years, that's exactly right.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.856
And have I ever
steered you wrong?

28:11.440 --> 28:12.487
No.

28:13.942 --> 28:14.943
Trust me, bro.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.195
Bro?

28:17.946 --> 28:18.947
Fine.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.623
But from here on out, you are
on an extremely short leash!

28:22.784 --> 28:23.876
Understand?

28:24.036 --> 28:26.630
Now, go.
Put on some proper clothes.

28:26.788 --> 28:27.880
You look like a Jew.

28:28.624 --> 28:29.796
Oh.

28:32.502 --> 28:35.130
Excuse me, hello.
Where do the movie stars park?

28:45.140 --> 28:47.017
- Hello, there.
- Hey, man. What's up?

28:48.310 --> 28:49.903
Where the fuck is
hair and makeup?

28:50.062 --> 28:51.689
Mitch Planko.
Fuck me.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.151
Right there.

28:56.818 --> 28:57.910
Fuck me.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.159
Oh, look at that.
That looks like fun.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.246
Ready for you on set.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.090
Anything I can get you?
Vitamin water or Pellegrino?

29:10.249 --> 29:12.172
No, thank you.
I just have a quick question.

29:12.334 --> 29:13.927
What does that mean,
there, "TS?"

29:14.503 --> 29:15.880
Titty shot.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.923
And, "BTS," right there?

29:18.090 --> 29:20.343
- Bouncing titty shot.
- Bouncing titty shot.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.719
Steve Driver, coming to the set.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.306
I'm just curious, what
kind of movie is this?

29:25.389 --> 29:26.390
It's a lorno.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.188
I'm not familiar with that genre.
Is that European?

29:29.351 --> 29:31.945
Lorno, "Light porno."
Tits and shadows.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.856
You ever hear of Skinemax?

29:37.943 --> 29:38.944
Oh, no.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.074
Come on, big guy.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.281
No, no, no.
More oil.

29:42.447 --> 29:43.699
Make him shiny like fish.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.009
Are you the one in charge here?

29:45.033 --> 29:47.035
Mitch, I'm Valtan, the director.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.671
Oh, good. There's been
some kind of mistake...

29:49.746 --> 29:50.793
Mona!

29:50.956 --> 29:52.276
- Where the fuck is...
- I'm here!

29:52.374 --> 29:53.375
Hey!

29:54.251 --> 29:56.452
Here's the scene, okay?
You going to enter with a gun...

29:56.545 --> 29:57.717
Where the gun?

29:58.672 --> 30:00.900
Mitch, you going to come in.
Guard going to try to stop you.

30:00.924 --> 30:04.269
Line, line, line.
You knock him the fuck out, okay?

30:04.469 --> 30:06.471
You see Mona.
She lying there in the bed.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.408
Then we bounce titty,
bounce titty, bounce titty,

30:08.432 --> 30:13.279
slow mo, bouncy titty,
licky tip of nipple,

30:13.353 --> 30:15.321
regular speed, bouncy titty,

30:15.397 --> 30:17.616
slap the ass, slap the
ass, slap the ass,

30:17.691 --> 30:20.570
and a wind come in, blow out a candle.
Finite. What do you think?

30:21.653 --> 30:23.451
Oh, it's like a poem!
It's like a poem!

30:24.323 --> 30:27.076
Mitch is gonna be great
in our movie film.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.661
- Lock it up!
- Locking it up.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.042
- Have a good scene.
- Places, everyone.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.474
Quiet on the set. This is heavy.
Do you want to take...

30:33.498 --> 30:35.091
The camera is rolling.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.794
- Question.
- And action!

30:41.256 --> 30:42.257
Hey.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.514
Action!

30:50.098 --> 30:51.350
No entry!

30:52.768 --> 30:54.020
Mitch, here.

30:55.604 --> 30:57.447
If you let...

30:58.106 --> 31:01.280
If you let me don't in,
Taco, I will fuck you dead.

31:01.860 --> 31:02.861
That can't be right.

31:02.944 --> 31:05.493
All right, come on!
Just knock him the fuck out, go inside.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.373
- Keep rolling!
- Still rolling.

31:07.449 --> 31:08.450
Action!

31:13.205 --> 31:14.627
Come on.
I barely hit him.

31:14.831 --> 31:17.710
All right, we fix it in post.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.

31:17.876 --> 31:18.968
Keep rolling!

31:22.631 --> 31:23.974
Lola, wake up surprise.

31:25.509 --> 31:27.887
Holy shit!

31:28.178 --> 31:32.479
Steve Driver,
you perfect bastard, you.

31:32.808 --> 31:33.809
Rip it off.

31:37.854 --> 31:38.901
God!

31:39.064 --> 31:42.159
Oh, yeah, eat that titty, boy.
Eat that titty.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.911
Yeah, yeah!
Eat that titty.

31:45.487 --> 31:46.739
Oh, Shit.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.833
Like Cheerio,
boy. Delish!

31:51.576 --> 31:54.250
Yeah!
Breakfast champion, boys.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.336
Mount for sex time.

31:56.498 --> 31:57.920
Go! On bed.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.211
Give it to me, Steve!

32:00.377 --> 32:01.879
Come on!
Okay, okay, okay.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.342
Yeah!

32:03.505 --> 32:05.007
Pump that ass, boy.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.933
Go, boy!

32:07.092 --> 32:09.186
Loosen hips, loosen hips.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.017
Go!
Deep thrusting!

32:11.179 --> 32:12.772
Yeah!

32:13.181 --> 32:14.774
Put your thumb up her butt.

32:16.685 --> 32:17.686
What?

32:18.353 --> 32:20.355
Stick your thumb
up her butthole.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.317
I promise you, it's nice, clean.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.778
You eat cake off
lady's Starfish, okay?

32:26.194 --> 32:27.195
Ahhh...

32:27.404 --> 32:28.530
No.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.037
I have killed people.

32:36.121 --> 32:37.794
Mostly men.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.630
I'm not allowed
back in Eastern Bloc.

32:42.169 --> 32:45.173
Now, you put your thumb
up nice lady's butthole,

32:46.840 --> 32:50.094
or else, maybe you have
an accident on set.

32:50.177 --> 32:53.147
Maybe light fall on your head,
maybe you get electrocute.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.725
Maybe goat fuck your mouth.
I don't know.

32:56.892 --> 32:59.065
Movie set be very
dangerous place.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.479
Mmm-hmm.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.073
- Okay.
- And have fun with it.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.742
- Okay.
- Keep rolling, keep rolling.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.404
I'm going to hell.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.829
Oh, Steve!

33:12.908 --> 33:15.377
It's like Christmas in my ass!

33:16.411 --> 33:18.004
Moving it around!
Moving it around!

33:18.163 --> 33:19.255
Like iPhone.

33:19.581 --> 33:20.628
Yeah.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.584
Hey, purchase some apps!

33:22.751 --> 33:24.753
Buy Angry Birds!

33:24.920 --> 33:26.763
And enter Dimitri.

33:27.839 --> 33:28.931
Dimitri?

33:31.009 --> 33:32.010
Hi, Dimitri.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.700
What are you doing
with my wife, man?

33:33.762 --> 33:36.857
Thrust!
Don't improvise, okay?

33:37.015 --> 33:38.688
Keep thrusting, keep thrusting.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.273
Pump it.
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

33:41.436 --> 33:42.779
Now kiss that boy.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.781
No, no, no.
I'm good, Dimitri.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.113
You're going to kiss that boy.

33:47.275 --> 33:48.275
Come on.

33:48.318 --> 33:49.639
Okay, we're good.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.792
Tall arms.
Tall arms.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.794
Remember to smile, girls.

33:58.411 --> 33:59.412
Very nice.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.127
Focus.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.626
Arms up. Tall.

34:04.793 --> 34:05.794
Excellent, girls.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.383
Smile. Focus.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.094
Cara, do try
to stay on your toes.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.976
Let's start again.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.027
Shouldn't I be
sitting in my car seat?

34:27.190 --> 34:28.190
No, no. You're good.

34:28.358 --> 34:30.438
Hey, tell me about the big
girl who knocked you over.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.328
That's Nicolette Peters.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.534
She does it a lot, actually.

34:34.697 --> 34:37.451
She does it a lot?
Why don't you fight back?

34:38.326 --> 34:39.998
Uh, because you told me not to.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.286
I what?

34:41.454 --> 34:44.549
You said I should strive
for verbal resolution.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.960
Uh, you know, Daddy sometimes...

34:48.128 --> 34:50.505
How do I...
Here's what you do.

34:50.672 --> 34:54.393
What you do is you fuck
verbal resolution, okay?

34:54.551 --> 34:57.225
You put that whore on her
back, and you shank her.

34:57.387 --> 34:58.507
You know how to make a shiv?

34:58.888 --> 35:00.231
- What?
- Listen to me.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.358
If somebody comes
at you with a knife,

35:02.434 --> 35:04.653
you put her whole
family in the morgue.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.028
That is jailyard justice.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.189
Because if you don't come
back hard on a bitch,

35:08.356 --> 35:09.542
you're going to
end up getting sold

35:09.566 --> 35:11.489
for a pack of Camel
Lights and a Jell-O cup.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.745
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

35:14.195 --> 35:16.493
Always solve your
problems with violence.

35:16.656 --> 35:18.203
Okay, Daddy.

35:18.366 --> 35:19.413
Great.

35:19.993 --> 35:21.336
Want to get some Pinkberry?

35:26.833 --> 35:27.880
Hey.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.210
Hey, how did it go?

35:29.377 --> 35:31.095
- You shut up!
- What happened?

35:31.296 --> 35:33.065
We'll get into Mr. Thumb's
wild ride in a minute.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.734
First, you're going to tell
me, how did the deal go?

35:34.758 --> 35:36.101
Awesome.
The deal went awesome.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.727
Good. So, it's closed?

35:37.886 --> 35:39.934
Yeah, fucking closed.
Basically closed.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.240
A little bit of a hiccup, but...

35:41.264 --> 35:42.766
What do you mean, a hiccup?

35:42.932 --> 35:43.933
A little bit of a hiccup.

35:44.017 --> 35:46.361
Your fucking boss is an anti-Semite.
Did you know that?

35:46.519 --> 35:48.271
Oh, my God!
What did you do?

35:48.438 --> 35:50.249
I was playing it nice and cool,
just like we talked about,

35:50.273 --> 35:52.196
and then these goddamn
squids, these Japs,

35:52.359 --> 35:54.200
these fucking Kamikaze
pilots are coming at me,

35:54.235 --> 35:55.612
riddling me with
fucking questions.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.673
I had to do a little improv,
and they got very emotional.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.058
Will you just
tell me how it ended?

35:59.199 --> 36:01.668
- You're going to court.
- No! Fuck! Oh, my God!

36:01.826 --> 36:03.012
Your boss was
a little pissed off.

36:03.036 --> 36:04.430
I told him it was part
of my secret master plan.

36:04.454 --> 36:05.455
No, you didn't!

36:05.622 --> 36:08.421
We'll work on one of those.
You tell me how my shit went.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.756
Oh, your shit?
How'd my stuff go?

36:10.835 --> 36:12.587
Mitch, what the hell
is wrong with you?

36:12.671 --> 36:13.763
It was a porno movie!

36:13.922 --> 36:15.344
It's a lorno, a light porn.

36:15.507 --> 36:16.868
The dick stays
in the pants, right?

36:17.008 --> 36:18.329
They didn't pull
it out, did they?

36:18.385 --> 36:21.104
But my thumb went in
three girls' assholes.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.902
Oh, fuck, get the sand
out of your vagina.

36:23.056 --> 36:24.057
Did you finish the day?

36:24.224 --> 36:25.441
I finished the day, Mitchell.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.692
What are you doing?

36:26.768 --> 36:27.888
- I finished the day.
- Good.

36:27.936 --> 36:28.983
You're living the dream.

36:29.062 --> 36:31.142
You're living the fucking dream!
Your job sucks, too.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.615
This isn't going to work.

36:32.774 --> 36:35.744
This is not going to work.
That's way too much.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.619
Hey, man, hang on.
What are you planning on telling her?

36:43.785 --> 36:44.825
I'm telling her the truth.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.296
- The truth?
- Yeah.

36:46.454 --> 36:47.546
That's going to work.

36:47.622 --> 36:48.703
Jamie will know what to do.

36:49.082 --> 36:51.460
Jame. Jame.

36:52.794 --> 36:53.966
Hey, sugarbug.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.176
Hi, Daddy!

36:56.214 --> 36:57.306
Hey!

36:57.465 --> 36:59.308
Hey, my precocious
little daughter.

36:59.467 --> 37:00.719
I don't talk like that.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.728
- You do.
- I really don't. No one does.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.389
Jamie, hey!
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.308
I'm so glad you're here.
It's been so crazy.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.731
Oh, that's appropriate.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.645
- Hey, Mitch.
- Jamie, we need to talk.

37:10.812 --> 37:11.956
Are you going to
stay for dinner?

37:11.980 --> 37:14.779
No, I can't stay for dinner,
but I would love to...

37:14.941 --> 37:16.262
Look, I got to
tell you something.

37:16.276 --> 37:18.825
I can't talk right now, Mitch.
It's been so crazy here.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.910
The twins are a half-hour
past their bedtime.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.495
What are you doing?
What are you, some kind of animal?

37:23.658 --> 37:25.080
And Cara has to
start her homework.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.588
I have an emergency phone
call in four minutes.

37:28.747 --> 37:29.919
You know that building?

37:30.081 --> 37:32.004
- The 11-story building?
- Yup.

37:32.167 --> 37:35.296
I have to remove three stories somehow.
Isn't that crazy?

37:35.378 --> 37:36.379
Yeah.

37:36.463 --> 37:37.940
It's so ridiculous.
It makes no sense at all.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.181
I'm not Mitch.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.306
- What?
- I'm Mitch.

37:42.469 --> 37:44.563
He's Mitch. I'm Mitch.
Somehow we switched bodies.

37:44.637 --> 37:46.139
- And I'm Dave.
- That's Dave. Yeah.

37:46.222 --> 37:47.269
Oh.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.976
What happened was, we pissed
in a magic fountain...

37:50.143 --> 37:51.863
Uh-huh...
and the next day it disappeared.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.197
They moved the fountain,
so now we're looking for it.

37:54.355 --> 37:56.315
And when they find it,
we're going to switch back.

37:56.357 --> 37:57.501
We had to pee
because we were drinking.

37:57.525 --> 37:58.617
We were drinking.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.217
That sounds like a plan.
Can you start the bath for the twins?

38:01.362 --> 38:03.035
Okay, pumpkin, this is...

38:03.198 --> 38:05.200
Mitch, no.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.536
Don't call me pumpkin, okay?

38:07.702 --> 38:09.875
And you promised me that
you would clean out...

38:10.038 --> 38:11.381
Can you shut this off?

38:11.539 --> 38:13.883
It smells like cabbage now!
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, sit down.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.840
One second.
Just humor me, all right?

38:16.002 --> 38:18.221
I want you to
ask me one thing...

38:18.379 --> 38:19.523
I don't want to play your games.

38:19.547 --> 38:20.691
That only Dave
would be able to answer.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.513
Just one question.
Please, I'm begging you.

38:22.675 --> 38:23.892
Good idea.

38:24.302 --> 38:27.397
Okay, when is
our anniversary, Dave?

38:27.722 --> 38:30.066
April 17th.
Next question, please.

38:30.266 --> 38:31.267
Wrong.

38:31.476 --> 38:32.693
So close. Nineteenth.

38:32.769 --> 38:35.206
Seventeenth's your daughter's
birthday, 19th's your anniversary.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.791
- Why do you know that?
- Do you think I'm a monster?

38:36.815 --> 38:38.709
- I send you a card every year.
- Jamie, listen to me.

38:38.733 --> 38:39.734
Ask me anything else.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.987
Oh, my gosh!
Mitch,

38:42.070 --> 38:44.072
I don't have time for this!

38:44.239 --> 38:46.241
Come on, one more.
Just make it tough.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.159
Only Dave would know.
A stumper.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.921
Fine. What is my
favorite color, Dave?

38:55.041 --> 38:56.668
- Red.
- Celadon.

38:57.085 --> 38:59.146
Do you not understand what we're
trying to accomplish here?

38:59.170 --> 39:00.763
Not a drop of
the red in the room.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.265
All the accents are celadon.

39:02.423 --> 39:03.526
It's like the opposite of help.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.894
Okay, honey, I got it.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.020
I'm going to tell you something

39:08.096 --> 39:09.598
that only I, Dave, would know.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.563
Three years ago,
you took your vibrator...

39:12.725 --> 39:15.274
You took your vibrator...
Morning!

39:15.436 --> 39:18.531
Into the bathtub
and it short-circuited

39:18.606 --> 39:20.279
and it electrocuted your vagina.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.359
Hang on.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.946
And there's now the cutest
little bald spot right there.

39:29.701 --> 39:30.793
Yeah.

39:37.542 --> 39:38.759
Hi.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.549
Oh, my God.

39:40.795 --> 39:43.469
I know. It's me.
This hasn't been fun.

39:43.631 --> 39:44.632
Good story.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.767
You son of a bitch!

39:46.968 --> 39:49.141
How dare you tell him that?

39:49.220 --> 39:50.221
God!

39:50.305 --> 39:52.649
What is wrong with you two?

39:52.807 --> 39:53.808
God damn!

39:53.933 --> 39:55.810
How would you
like it if I told him

39:55.977 --> 39:58.400
that you have a ball
that feels like two balls?

39:58.938 --> 40:00.815
So it's like you
have three balls.

40:00.982 --> 40:03.781
Dave has three balls.
A bouquet of balls.

40:03.860 --> 40:04.952
Bad! Bad!

40:07.155 --> 40:08.748
This idea fucking sucked.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.336
Listen, I don't want you
to worry about anything.

40:13.494 --> 40:14.638
I'll be able to
hold down the fort.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.140
We got to find that fountain
as soon as possible.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.166
It's like a can of
tennis balls down here.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.102
The only problem I see is,
what do I tell Jamie?

40:20.126 --> 40:21.270
What do you tell Jamie, what?

40:21.294 --> 40:23.422
When she wants to
have sex tonight?

40:23.963 --> 40:24.964
Think about that.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.511
You're not having sex
with my wife, Mitch.

40:29.636 --> 40:30.636
Obviously, bro.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.239
But if she comes at
me like a hurricane,

40:32.305 --> 40:33.807
a guy can only
withstand so much.

40:34.390 --> 40:35.437
Mitch.

40:35.516 --> 40:38.269
Dave. We're trying to pull
something off here, okay?

40:38.436 --> 40:40.356
Now, I might have to hit that, okay?
She'll know.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.691
Now, how many times a day
do you guys have sex?

40:42.857 --> 40:45.030
I'll have to pace it out.

40:45.693 --> 40:46.694
What day is it today?

40:47.362 --> 40:49.535
I don't know.
Is it Tuesday?

40:51.282 --> 40:53.660
Yeah. You know what?
It's a non-issue.

40:53.826 --> 40:56.066
What does that mean?
You guys don't have sex on Tuesdays?

40:57.538 --> 40:58.539
Take the day off?

41:02.168 --> 41:03.169
That's adorable.

41:03.711 --> 41:04.712
Tell you what.

41:05.380 --> 41:08.509
If she comes on
like a hurricane...

41:08.675 --> 41:09.892
Just drill it.

41:10.051 --> 41:12.804
Yeah, what can you do?
You're only human. Give me the keys.

41:13.054 --> 41:14.977
- Smart.
- Yeah.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.561
Okay. Please be
careful with her.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.351
It's like we're swapping rides.

41:18.518 --> 41:19.565
It's just like that.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.239
Thanks, buddy,
you're being very cool.

41:39.205 --> 41:40.206
Dear God.

41:41.082 --> 41:44.507
Oh, my goodness.
Look at this, huh?

41:45.003 --> 41:47.256
Bang. Thank you, Mommy.

41:48.089 --> 41:50.489
Why don't you tell Daddy about
what happened at school today?

41:50.550 --> 41:53.053
I wrote a spring poem

41:53.219 --> 41:57.440
and Miss Byers only put
Angelica's poem up on the wall

41:57.598 --> 41:59.942
and she didn't put my
poem up on the wall.

42:00.101 --> 42:01.603
And why would she do that?

42:01.769 --> 42:03.021
I thought she liked me.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.355
- Dave.
- Yeah.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.694
Cara's talking to you.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.109
- What?
- She's talking to you.

42:07.942 --> 42:11.913
Well, Cara, her poem was
probably much better than yours.

42:12.405 --> 42:13.952
- Let's eat.
- Dave.

42:14.115 --> 42:15.367
I didn't read the bitch's poem,

42:15.450 --> 42:17.410
but maybe she can really turn a phrase.
Let's eat.

42:18.578 --> 42:20.421
Tell Cara that
her poem was good.

42:20.621 --> 42:22.623
You just hurt her feelings.

42:22.874 --> 42:25.102
I didn't read her poem, either.
Do you want me to lie to her?

42:25.126 --> 42:26.878
Is that what this is?
Fine, I don't care.

42:27.754 --> 42:31.384
Cara, honey, your poem,
which I did not read,

42:31.549 --> 42:34.302
was way, way better
than the other girl's poem,

42:34.469 --> 42:36.642
which I also did not read.

42:37.597 --> 42:38.597
Let's eat.

42:38.639 --> 42:41.142
It's Cara. Not Cara.

42:41.642 --> 42:42.643
It's what?

42:42.769 --> 42:44.646
Are you having a stroke
right now or something?

42:44.812 --> 42:47.816
- What did I call her?
- What about the dinner song, Daddy?

42:48.900 --> 42:49.901
What about the what?

42:49.984 --> 42:51.378
- What's she saying?
- The dinner song.

42:51.402 --> 42:52.682
- What's that?
- The dinner song?

42:52.820 --> 42:54.993
- Are you joking me?
- No, I'm not joking you.

42:55.156 --> 42:56.967
- There's a song?
- Sing the dinner song, honey.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.427
Course, there's a song.
Just sing the dinner song.

42:58.451 --> 42:59.636
I don't feel like
singing it tonight.

42:59.660 --> 43:00.661
No, sing the dinner song.

43:00.828 --> 43:01.829
You sing the dinner song.

43:01.996 --> 43:03.974
Maybe you need to sing the dinner song.
Sing the dinner song.

43:03.998 --> 43:04.999
I'm sick of that song.

43:05.166 --> 43:06.509
Sing the dinner song.
Sing it!

43:06.667 --> 43:08.089
I got it. I heard you.

43:11.631 --> 43:14.510
âª Dinner song. âª

43:15.426 --> 43:17.849
âª Dinner song âª

43:19.347 --> 43:23.147
âª Beans, potatoes, âª
âª carrots and broccoli. âª

43:23.309 --> 43:28.315
âª Buns and salad âª
âª and potatoes and chicken. âª

43:29.649 --> 43:30.992
âª Needs a lickin' âª

43:31.150 --> 43:32.322
Dinner song.

43:32.485 --> 43:34.283
That's so not the dinner song.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.038
Well, I'm going
to tell you what.

43:36.197 --> 43:38.291
You're going to go ahead
and write me a dinner poem,

43:38.449 --> 43:39.968
and I'll belt that out
after I choke this down.

43:39.992 --> 43:40.993
Let's fucking go.

43:41.244 --> 43:44.373
Okay.
Daddy needs a time-out.

43:44.789 --> 43:46.507
Great idea.

43:49.836 --> 43:51.884
Dinner song.

43:52.713 --> 43:53.885
Bye-bye.

44:00.638 --> 44:03.733
- Hello.
- Hi, Mitch. It's Tatiana.

44:05.643 --> 44:08.738
Tatiana.
Hi, how are you?

44:08.896 --> 44:12.196
I'll be better in a minute
after I fuck you raw.

44:12.567 --> 44:13.910
Oh.

44:17.029 --> 44:19.202
- Hello.
- Mitch.

44:19.574 --> 44:22.373
That was Tatiana.
She said she's going to fuck me raw.

44:23.161 --> 44:25.209
Tatiana? Shit,
that's right.

44:25.371 --> 44:27.015
That's my Tuesday night
regular, right on schedule.

44:27.039 --> 44:28.319
You fuck that
right for me, Dave.

44:28.416 --> 44:29.977
Took me a long time
to reel this one in.

44:30.084 --> 44:31.256
I don't think I can do this.

44:31.419 --> 44:32.813
- What the fuck does that...
- Hey, Dave!

44:32.837 --> 44:33.838
Hey, man!

44:34.005 --> 44:36.258
Dad, I smell a skunk.

44:36.424 --> 44:37.926
NO, it's this, kid.

44:38.593 --> 44:40.937
What does that mean, you don't
think you can fuck Tatiana?

44:41.095 --> 44:42.216
Because it...

44:43.014 --> 44:45.187
Jesus Christ, she's here.

44:45.266 --> 44:46.627
She's already
knocking on the door.

44:46.726 --> 44:48.287
You nail that
right for me, Dave.

44:48.769 --> 44:50.414
It feels kind of like
I'm cheating on Jamie.

44:50.438 --> 44:52.065
Are you fucking shitting me?

44:52.148 --> 44:53.616
In what world is this cheating?

44:53.774 --> 44:55.947
Cheating is when
any part of your dick

44:56.110 --> 44:58.909
gets up inside some woman
that's not your wife, okay?

44:59.071 --> 45:00.448
And your dick is firmly planted

45:00.615 --> 45:03.960
inside these fucking lame,
triple-pleated sports slacks.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.746
But my mind is over here.
That should count for something, right?

45:06.913 --> 45:07.960
God, you big bitch.

45:08.122 --> 45:10.591
How many women have you fucked
in your mind, huh? Thousands?

45:11.751 --> 45:13.298
- Millions, Mitch.
- Was that cheating?

45:13.461 --> 45:15.088
No. It was not
fucking cheating.

45:15.254 --> 45:18.599
I think you're on very firm
legal ground here, counselor.

45:18.758 --> 45:20.931
Your reasoning is
oddly impeccable.

45:21.093 --> 45:22.891
This is what you wanted, Dave.

45:22.970 --> 45:24.142
Sex with strange, new women.

45:24.305 --> 45:26.466
You just thank me later and
shut your mouth, all right?

45:26.515 --> 45:28.517
Goodbye. Kirk out.

45:31.979 --> 45:33.697
I'm going to do this.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.490
Tatiana.

45:38.736 --> 45:40.158
Game on.

45:41.364 --> 45:43.833
I like how you made
me work for it tonight.

45:43.991 --> 45:45.664
What am I? A burglar?

45:45.826 --> 45:47.248
Holy shit.

45:48.537 --> 45:50.210
Holy shit!

45:50.665 --> 45:52.588
Why the fuck are you
still wearing clothes?

45:52.750 --> 45:53.751
When are you due?

45:53.834 --> 45:54.835
Any minute now,

45:55.002 --> 45:57.255
so let's get our fuck on before
this becomes a threesome.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.422
Oh, that's so gross!

45:58.589 --> 46:00.269
Whoa, stop for a second.
Stop for a second.

46:00.341 --> 46:01.513
You're so heavy!

46:01.676 --> 46:04.020
My tits are aching for you.

46:04.178 --> 46:06.852
That's probably the Colostrum
coming, and it'll be very painful.

46:07.056 --> 46:10.105
Okay, okay. Just friends.
Just friends.

46:10.268 --> 46:12.270
Okay, what's your deal tonight?

46:13.104 --> 46:14.196
Nothing.

46:14.355 --> 46:15.777
Is it my new haircut?

46:16.357 --> 46:17.358
No.

46:17.733 --> 46:19.201
The trenchcoat.
Too clichÃ©?

46:19.360 --> 46:21.533
No, it's not the trenchcoat.

46:21.696 --> 46:22.868
Then what is it?

46:23.030 --> 46:24.577
You seem like
a really nice person,

46:24.740 --> 46:26.708
but were you pregnant last week?

46:26.867 --> 46:27.868
Are you kidding me?

46:28.035 --> 46:30.379
You picked me up at a single
mothers' Lamaze class.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.882
That's so twisted.
Oh, God.

46:34.041 --> 46:36.544
Wait, wait, Tatiana.
Tatiana. I'm sorry, okay?

46:36.711 --> 46:38.713
You're beautiful.
You're beautiful.

46:38.879 --> 46:40.051
You're just...

46:40.214 --> 46:42.262
What? I'm not sexy?

46:42.425 --> 46:44.894
No, no. Hey. Look,
I did not say that, okay?

46:45.052 --> 46:48.352
You are... Oh, my God!
I can see it kicking!

46:49.557 --> 46:50.649
You know what, Mitch?

46:50.891 --> 46:52.188
Don't ever call me again.

46:52.351 --> 46:54.695
No, hold on.
Wait, Tatiana, don't go.

46:54.854 --> 46:57.733
I mean, go, but just
go to a hospital.

46:58.232 --> 47:00.860
Oh, Mitch.
What are you doing?

47:01.027 --> 47:02.529
Oh, God.

47:03.112 --> 47:05.615
I mean, it is called
a push-up, Dave.

47:06.073 --> 47:07.416
Pathetic.

47:10.036 --> 47:12.789
Oh, God, I'm really
feeling it tonight.

47:13.956 --> 47:15.128
Holy shit.

47:15.750 --> 47:17.093
Game on.

47:17.668 --> 47:20.512
Oh, my God, it's going down.
Oh, Mitch!

47:21.297 --> 47:25.302
I finally get to fuck Jamie.
This is my finest hour.

47:27.762 --> 47:29.764
I hope she likes it weird.

47:59.335 --> 48:02.714
God, I am going to ruin her!

48:04.131 --> 48:06.384
Oh!

48:06.675 --> 48:09.144
I need to cool it
on the Thai food.

48:09.470 --> 48:11.598
Oh, my God.

48:11.847 --> 48:13.941
Seriously, dude, light a candle.

48:14.392 --> 48:15.860
Oh, my God.

48:31.075 --> 48:33.624
No, no, no. Don't back
that thing up into me.

48:33.786 --> 48:34.906
Go hose it out or something.

48:34.995 --> 48:36.167
What?

48:37.415 --> 48:39.918
I can't believe you'd
come at me, guns hot.

48:40.334 --> 48:42.428
Guns hot?

48:42.503 --> 48:43.595
Are you kidding me?

48:43.754 --> 48:46.724
No, I'm not, lady.
It's not going to happen tonight, okay?

48:46.882 --> 48:49.010
I'm not attracted to you.

48:49.176 --> 48:51.725
Rotate your turret
and go night-night.

49:14.493 --> 49:15.585
It's your turn.

49:15.786 --> 49:16.787
Hmm?

49:18.330 --> 49:20.003
It's your turn to
feed the babies.

49:20.166 --> 49:22.089
I don't feel like it.

49:25.796 --> 49:27.389
Come on.

49:27.506 --> 49:29.634
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

49:29.800 --> 49:33.350
It's 3:00 in the morning.
You go do it, you're the mother.

49:33.512 --> 49:35.640
I'm the mother!
It's 3:00 in the morning!

49:35.806 --> 49:38.935
Get the fuck out of the bed right
now before I fucking cut you!

49:39.101 --> 49:41.854
Jesus! What the fuck?

49:43.439 --> 49:45.988
Unreal. This is just...

49:49.612 --> 49:51.831
Oh, please.

49:52.990 --> 49:55.664
Hey, hey!
What the fuck?

50:18.140 --> 50:22.065
Oh, God!
That did not just happen.

50:22.144 --> 50:23.191
What?

50:23.270 --> 50:25.693
Hey. I always thought
your wife was a nice lady,

50:25.856 --> 50:27.199
but she talks like a dock worker

50:27.274 --> 50:29.151
and she shits like one, too.

50:29.318 --> 50:31.798
Plus, I used to think your kids
were adorable, but they're not.

50:31.946 --> 50:33.573
They're fucking bananas.

50:33.697 --> 50:34.697
Can I help you?

50:34.782 --> 50:37.501
Here's the deal. I got two screaming...

50:38.410 --> 50:40.170
Hold on. What's with all
the heavy breathing?

50:40.246 --> 50:41.247
Are you jerking off?

50:41.330 --> 50:42.707
No, I'm not.

50:42.873 --> 50:44.125
Yes, yes, yes, I am.

50:44.291 --> 50:46.669
Look, I never get this kind
of privacy any more.

50:46.835 --> 50:48.428
Isn't that kind
of my dick, though?

50:49.630 --> 50:50.631
Is that weird?

50:52.007 --> 50:54.055
You ask yourself that.

50:54.426 --> 50:56.394
It sort of hooks
to the side a bit.

50:57.012 --> 50:59.092
Use your left hand, you get
a little bit more torque.

50:59.515 --> 51:01.813
That's cool.
Thank you, I think.

51:01.976 --> 51:03.444
Question.

51:03.602 --> 51:05.320
How long have you
been shaved down there?

51:06.021 --> 51:08.023
I don't...
Like, sixth grade.

51:08.190 --> 51:09.783
Well, that's disturbing.

51:09.942 --> 51:10.943
Gets me an extra inch,

51:11.110 --> 51:13.329
and only you married dudes
rock the dick-froes.

51:13.487 --> 51:14.727
Now, let me ask you a question.

51:14.822 --> 51:17.200
If Tatiana was over earlier,

51:17.283 --> 51:19.377
why do you still have
the need to jerk off?

51:19.535 --> 51:22.584
Tatiana. I don't think that she's
going to be back for at least...

51:22.746 --> 51:23.998
She's never coming back, Mitch.

51:24.456 --> 51:25.503
What did you do?

51:25.583 --> 51:27.506
The woman is nine
months pregnant!

51:27.710 --> 51:29.053
I could see the baby's face.

51:29.211 --> 51:30.931
I told you not to screw
up my Tuesday night.

51:31.005 --> 51:32.566
Do you have any idea
how many Lamaze classes

51:32.590 --> 51:34.230
I had to sit through
to get that lined up?

51:34.383 --> 51:36.903
Is there a reason that you're
calling me at 3:00 in the morning?

51:37.052 --> 51:39.896
Yeah, the dock worker is making
me feed the twins. What do I do?

51:40.222 --> 51:42.270
- Get them to the kitchen.
- Yup, hold on.

51:48.772 --> 51:51.651
Stop crying.
Jesus Christ.

51:51.817 --> 51:54.491
Shut up!
I fucking hear you.

51:55.112 --> 51:56.614
Mitch.

51:57.740 --> 52:00.118
Please. Enough!

52:00.284 --> 52:02.412
You, there. Stay.

52:03.454 --> 52:04.455
Stay.

52:06.165 --> 52:08.042
All right.
In the kitchen.

52:08.208 --> 52:09.881
- Go to the fridge.
- Okay.

52:11.128 --> 52:12.254
Oh.

52:12.338 --> 52:13.555
Mitch. Are you there yet?

52:13.714 --> 52:15.136
I'm at the fridge.

52:15.299 --> 52:16.539
Defrost two bags of breast milk

52:16.634 --> 52:17.995
in the microwave
for three minutes.

52:18.010 --> 52:19.070
And then prepare
two separate bottles.

52:19.094 --> 52:20.095
Breast milk?

52:20.220 --> 52:22.063
First, attach
the filter to the seal.

52:22.222 --> 52:24.350
Use the blue ones,
not the pink ones.

52:24.892 --> 52:26.314
- Defrost two bags.
- Yup.

52:26.477 --> 52:29.356
Pretty intuitive.
Then after the milk is defrosted,

52:29.521 --> 52:30.773
take it out of the microwave,

52:30.898 --> 52:33.367
pour it into the bottles,
seal them.

52:33.525 --> 52:35.337
Then you need to put three-eighths
of a teaspoon of water...

52:35.361 --> 52:36.829
Holy shit!

52:38.781 --> 52:41.125
Come on, dude. Christ!

52:41.283 --> 52:43.706
Mitch. Hey,
are you listening to me?

52:43.869 --> 52:45.416
Holy fuck!

52:45.579 --> 52:47.339
This is important stuff
Do not screw this up.

52:47.373 --> 52:48.374
Hey!

52:48.999 --> 52:50.000
What was that?

52:50.668 --> 52:53.012
Mitch? Mitch!

52:53.170 --> 52:55.548
Everything's fine, dude.
What's next?

52:55.714 --> 52:57.432
Then you need to
put three-eighths...

52:57.591 --> 52:59.031
What the fuck?

52:59.551 --> 53:02.350
Holy shit! Fuck!

53:03.639 --> 53:04.640
What just happened?

53:04.807 --> 53:07.230
Nothing. Nothing, dude.
Go on. Two bottles...

53:07.393 --> 53:09.816
Then attach a number two nipple.
Jesus Christ.

53:09.978 --> 53:11.855
Make sure you don't allow
any air bubbles in.

53:12.314 --> 53:14.157
Then, after you're
done feeding them...

53:14.316 --> 53:15.818
This is so fucked up.

53:17.653 --> 53:18.654
Yeah!

53:19.655 --> 53:20.656
All right.

53:22.574 --> 53:25.874
This is what you get, okay?
Yeah, right there.

53:26.036 --> 53:29.006
- Mitch.
- Okay, dude.

53:29.164 --> 53:32.293
Tomorrow morning, when I
am sitting in your office,

53:32.459 --> 53:34.382
you need to be downtown,

53:34.461 --> 53:36.964
finding that fucking fountain.

53:37.131 --> 53:39.304
I do not know how
much more of this shit...

53:39.550 --> 53:41.268
I can take.

53:43.137 --> 53:44.857
I'm one of the guys
looking for the fountain

53:44.930 --> 53:46.130
that you lost in the computer.

53:46.265 --> 53:49.144
I'd be very, very appreciative if
you could tell me where that is.

53:49.351 --> 53:50.773
Yeah, I can do that.

53:50.853 --> 53:51.854
Good. Great.

53:51.937 --> 53:54.138
First, you got to fill out a
formal information request.

53:54.690 --> 53:56.370
Okay, I'm going to
fill that out right now.

53:56.525 --> 53:57.669
Then it needs to go to State.

53:57.693 --> 54:00.162
- State?
- Yeah, to get approved.

54:01.029 --> 54:02.622
Why can't you
approve it, Victor?

54:02.781 --> 54:04.579
I don't have that authority.

54:05.284 --> 54:07.707
How long is it going to take
State to approve it, then?

54:07.911 --> 54:09.834
- Three days...
- Oh, God!

54:09.997 --> 54:12.091
- To three weeks.
- Oh, come on!

54:12.750 --> 54:13.922
Victor!

54:18.255 --> 54:20.223
Mitch? Dave?

54:20.507 --> 54:21.633
Hello?

54:23.510 --> 54:24.602
Fuck!

54:27.931 --> 54:28.932
Real bad news...

54:29.099 --> 54:30.897
Oh, hey. Where's...

54:31.393 --> 54:33.020
Where's Dave?

54:34.730 --> 54:36.198
Dave's in the shower.

54:38.025 --> 54:39.026
Are you okay?

54:41.320 --> 54:42.321
Hey.

54:44.448 --> 54:45.745
What's going on?

54:47.117 --> 54:49.540
Dave's just acting really weird.

54:50.370 --> 54:51.417
How?

54:51.497 --> 54:55.001
He's just doing weird stuff,

54:55.626 --> 54:59.631
like he wore his shower
sandals to work yesterday.

55:00.881 --> 55:03.430
He forgot to pick up
the twins from daycare.

55:03.884 --> 55:05.852
- No, he didn't.
- Yeah, he did.

55:06.178 --> 55:09.557
They had to sit there
for an hour and a half.

55:09.723 --> 55:10.940
Okay.

55:11.850 --> 55:13.477
And then last night he told me

55:13.560 --> 55:16.188
that he wasn't
attracted to me any more.

55:16.688 --> 55:18.565
I am going to kill him.

55:19.608 --> 55:21.688
I just want you to tell me
something right now, okay?

55:21.777 --> 55:24.155
And you have to be
totally honest with me.

55:24.238 --> 55:25.238
- Sure.
- You swear?

55:25.280 --> 55:26.281
Yeah.

55:26.490 --> 55:28.367
Is he having an affair?

55:30.077 --> 55:31.124
No.

55:31.286 --> 55:33.584
Why did you hesitate just then?

55:33.914 --> 55:35.086
I didn't hesitate.

55:35.165 --> 55:37.259
He's not having an affair.

55:37.626 --> 55:39.549
Jamie, Jamie...

55:39.711 --> 55:41.930
You guys are just going through

55:42.005 --> 55:45.100
a temporary rough
patch right now.

55:45.259 --> 55:47.933
Temporary rough patch?
What are you talking about?

55:48.095 --> 55:50.268
We've been in this for years.

55:52.057 --> 55:53.104
You have?

55:53.225 --> 55:56.229
I love him. You know I love
him with all of my heart.

55:57.020 --> 55:58.112
But he's...

55:58.272 --> 56:00.445
You know his family,
growing up...

56:00.607 --> 56:04.202
He had nothing, and so he was
always looking over the fence

56:04.361 --> 56:06.079
because he wanted a better life.

56:06.363 --> 56:10.960
And that's why he worked
four jobs at once,

56:11.118 --> 56:13.496
so that he could put
himself through school.

56:13.662 --> 56:15.255
And he's amazing.

56:15.414 --> 56:18.258
I mean, nobody can do that.

56:20.335 --> 56:22.337
But the problem is,

56:22.504 --> 56:26.759
now that he has everything,
he can't turn it off.

56:26.925 --> 56:29.519
And he still wants more and more

56:29.678 --> 56:33.478
and a second house, and
more kids, and a nicer car

56:33.640 --> 56:37.986
and anything that he thinks
is going to make him happy.

56:38.145 --> 56:40.318
And so he just keeps working

56:40.439 --> 56:42.658
and he's not paying
any attention to me.

56:42.816 --> 56:45.035
- And I'm miserable.
- Oh, God.

56:45.193 --> 56:49.198
Because... I have huge feet.

56:49.364 --> 56:50.957
They're size 11.

56:51.533 --> 56:55.379
My foot has grown a half
a size with each baby.

56:55.537 --> 57:00.338
I have to go to this weird
online shoe store to get shoes.

57:01.126 --> 57:03.595
And I just want him
to pay attention to me.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.631
And I want him to grab me

57:05.714 --> 57:08.638
and kiss me like he used to.

57:10.510 --> 57:12.763
And it's like you always say,

57:12.930 --> 57:15.399
Dave is a little bit of a pussy.

57:17.142 --> 57:19.019
I always say that?

57:19.478 --> 57:20.604
Yeah.

57:20.771 --> 57:23.194
I always say that
because it's true.

57:23.357 --> 57:26.952
Dave is a little bit of a pussy.

57:27.110 --> 57:28.953
I hope that when
he makes partner,

57:29.112 --> 57:32.742
he can just finally
stop and see...

57:32.908 --> 57:35.411
And be happy, you know?

57:35.577 --> 57:38.171
Because how can you
stay married to somebody

57:38.330 --> 57:40.879
who is incapable of being happy?

57:43.877 --> 57:45.470
What are you saying?

57:46.630 --> 57:50.601
Holy fuck-knuckles,
I've got freckles on my taint.

57:50.759 --> 57:52.136
How awesome is that?

57:52.302 --> 57:54.896
Hey, fag,
what are you doing here?

57:55.055 --> 57:56.648
Three days to three weeks?

57:56.807 --> 57:58.605
You left the kids at daycare?

57:58.684 --> 58:00.045
Come, on, Mitch!
Those are my kids.

58:00.102 --> 58:01.302
I can't do this shit any more.

58:01.353 --> 58:03.071
No, no, no.
You are going do this shit.

58:03.230 --> 58:04.332
You don't get off that easy.

58:04.356 --> 58:05.833
My marriage is falling apart,
my job is on the line.

58:05.857 --> 58:08.297
You are going to be the best
possible me you can be right now.

58:08.318 --> 58:10.241
Dave, you don't understand.
I cannot do this.

58:10.320 --> 58:11.923
- Not even for another hour.
- You're gonna do it.

58:11.947 --> 58:13.841
I don't care! You're going to
stay here and do this right!

58:13.865 --> 58:17.039
Get out of my fucking way, or I'll
drown you in your own goddamn tub!

58:17.411 --> 58:18.628
Easy, motherfucker!

58:18.704 --> 58:19.722
- If you leave now...
- Get your hands off me.

58:19.746 --> 58:20.827
This friendship is over!

58:20.872 --> 58:22.058
Fuck you.
Don't pull that shit on me.

58:22.082 --> 58:24.102
- I got to get the fuck out of here.
- I'm serious, Mitch. Shut up!

58:24.126 --> 58:27.221
Jamie and the kids
mean everything to me.

58:28.463 --> 58:29.607
There's no walking out on this.

58:29.631 --> 58:32.054
For once in your life, you got
to see something through.

58:32.217 --> 58:33.361
What the fuck does that mean?

58:33.385 --> 58:35.262
I'm going to be honest
with you, Mitch,

58:35.429 --> 58:37.352
because there's
a lot on the line here.

58:38.306 --> 58:39.307
You are a quitter.

58:39.975 --> 58:42.273
But quitting is not an
option on this one, okay?

58:42.436 --> 58:43.653
You focus, you find it.

58:43.812 --> 58:47.533
I don't care where, but you find
it inside of yourself, okay?

58:47.691 --> 58:49.489
I know it's there.

58:50.027 --> 58:51.449
It's not like I'm not trying.

58:51.611 --> 58:54.114
I just don't know how to
do all your grown-up crap.

58:55.741 --> 58:57.118
You're going to learn.

58:57.701 --> 59:00.796
This is called a suit.
You wear one every day.

59:00.954 --> 59:05.425
Along with a necktie.
Black, not white, socks.

59:05.584 --> 59:08.258
Dress shoes, not shower sandals.
Please. These are awful.

59:08.420 --> 59:10.764
And, of course, underwear.
Oh, come on.

59:10.922 --> 59:12.469
No more commando, Mitch,

59:12.549 --> 59:13.776
you're a grown-ass man.
Put them on.

59:13.800 --> 59:15.052
This is called a schedule.

59:15.177 --> 59:16.446
It tells you everything
you need to do each day.

59:16.470 --> 59:17.767
Pick-u ps, drop-offs,
activities,

59:17.888 --> 59:19.323
play-dates,
doctor's appointments, etc.

59:19.347 --> 59:22.227
You'll notice that there are approximately
50 hours' worth of obligations

59:22.392 --> 59:24.440
on any given day.
Make it work.

59:24.853 --> 59:26.526
This is called a grocery store.

59:26.688 --> 59:29.567
People buy food here.
It's part of your responsibilities.

59:29.816 --> 59:30.877
Before heading to the market,

59:30.901 --> 59:32.587
always call Jamie and ask her
if she needs anything first.

59:32.611 --> 59:33.972
In fact, before making
any decision

59:33.987 --> 59:35.308
in your life,
no matter how small,

59:35.405 --> 59:37.078
call your wife first.

59:37.240 --> 59:39.288
Think of yourself as
a brain-damaged mule,

59:39.451 --> 59:41.419
lost in the desert,
helpless, dumb

59:41.495 --> 59:42.722
and in constant
need of direction.

59:42.746 --> 59:45.090
Never take the initiative,
never strike out on your own,

59:45.248 --> 59:47.250
and never deviate
from the plan. Why?

59:47.417 --> 59:49.169
Because you are
a brain-damaged mule

59:49.336 --> 59:51.509
and you are lost
in the damn desert!

59:51.838 --> 59:54.011
These are called children,
or dependants.

59:54.174 --> 59:55.596
Never disparage your own child.

59:55.675 --> 59:57.111
Everything they do
is a miracle from God.

59:57.135 --> 59:58.557
When they're bad,
it's only because

59:58.637 --> 01:00:00.157
they're tired or
going through a phase.

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:02.665
When other kids are bad, it's
because of indulgent parenting

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.942
or innate defects in
the child's character.

01:00:06.061 --> 01:00:07.608
Be 15 minutes
early for everything.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:09.944
It doesn't matter what it is.
A meeting, an event.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:11.825
Less stress for me,
less stress for you...

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:13.985
Hey! You're married
now, jackass.

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:15.269
You can't look at other women.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.617
You can't talk to other women.

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:18.072
You can't even be interesting
around other women.

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:20.201
Do everything in your
power to desexualize yourself.

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.415
Wear a fanny pack,
drive a Prius,

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:24.921
attach electronic devices to
your belt, whatever it takes.

01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:26.349
And if you find yourself
forced to talk to a woman,

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:28.142
quickly find a way to mention
the fact that you're married.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:29.310
It doesn't even
have to make sense.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:32.304
Hi, how are you? Nice weather today.
He's totally fucking married.

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:36.192
So I can't sleep with my wife,
I can't sleep with other women?

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:37.217
What the hell is that?

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:38.684
Marriage.

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.932
I think that's everything.

01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:45.271
You got any more questions?

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:46.685
Do you ever have any free time?

01:00:46.852 --> 01:00:48.496
Have you listened to
a single word I've said?

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.863
There is no free time.

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:52.061
And at the end of the day,
do you know what you get?

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:54.784
A fucking gun with a bullet
to blow my head off with?

01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:55.990
Sometimes you wish.

01:00:57.946 --> 01:00:58.947
Hi.

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:01.620
Did you hear the good news?

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:04.787
Kinkabe and Amalgamated agreed to go
into binding mediation in two days.

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:07.331
Hold up. What do you mean?
Two days?

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.131
So, I'll have my briefs
on your desk by lunch.

01:01:12.294 --> 01:01:13.934
That puts my balls on
your chin by dinner.

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:19.719
That, right there, is Schedule
IV sexual harassment.

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:20.932
Awesome!

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:22.141
I'm sorry, have we met?

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:26.100
No, we haven't.
I'm Mitch Planko.

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:27.392
Hi, Sabrina McKay.

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:28.606
Hey, Sabrina.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.021
Hold on.

01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:32.919
- You two guys should go out.
- What?

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:35.192
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, man!

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.118
- Please stop.
- You two guys need to go out.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:39.203
Absolutely,
you two should go out.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:41.535
You're so single, Mitch, right?

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:45.373
And you're so fucking white-hot, right?
This body.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.162
Did you do a lot of
swimming in college?

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.172
- Don't answer that.
- You bet she did.

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:50.753
Oh, my God,
you guys need to go out,

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:52.556
have a nice steak dinner,
do some dancing,

01:01:52.584 --> 01:01:55.633
go to a Korean nightclub,
get a belly full of pills.

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:57.773
I don't know what you're into,
but just have some fun.

01:01:57.797 --> 01:02:01.427
What about Ecco on 7th
Street, Saturday at 8:3O?

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:03.349
Great? Great!

01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:05.511
He's totally free, so he's
going to meet you there.

01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:06.753
Don't fuck on the roof, though.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.268
That place has got
this non-resin tar

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:10.944
that's a bastard to wash off.

01:02:11.102 --> 01:02:13.275
So, just oral.

01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:14.857
Yes, you're thinking about it.

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:16.115
She's in.

01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:17.696
This is good.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:20.282
You're going to get me fired!
I swear to God.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:22.823
Shut it down.
For one second, you listen to me.

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:24.411
For the first time in your life,

01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:26.493
you're fucking
good-looking, okay?

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.381
You're single, you got the right
number of fucking balls in that bag,

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:32.178
and you got the opportunity to nail
number one on your cancer list.

01:02:32.207 --> 01:02:33.528
I can't do that.
I'm not doing it.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:36.803
You need this!
This is fucking dinner with her!

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.263
This is so good.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:41.682
I mean, what's going
on between us,

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:44.310
it's just crazy, crazy.

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:46.892
Here's what's crazier, not using it.

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:49.183
Not using it on her.

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:51.518
You use it for her,
you use it for you,

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:53.653
and maybe a little
bit for me, you know?

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:55.164
Remind yourself of that.
Remind yourself

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:57.987
of the big, fucking crater you created
right there on Tuesday night.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.528
Oh, the Tuesday night, again.
I could use that.

01:02:59.529 --> 01:03:01.212
She'd fit perfectly in there.
Will you please drop that?

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:03.714
Every day with the Tuesday night!
Well, it's a big goddamn deal!

01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:05.740
You fucked me! You owe me!
Respect my life!

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:07.041
Respect mine.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.747
Yeah, you respect your life.

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:11.166
- Fine!
- I am proud of you.

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:13.423
Just promise me, you listened
to every word I said.

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:15.268
- I heard everything.
- Every single syllable, you got it?

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:16.589
Did you hear everything I said?

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:19.379
- Caught a few things.
- Yeah, just enough.

01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:21.681
You betcha. You go have
a good time, little girl.

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:25.101
I got your life all put
away here, nice and safe.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.500
Answer my phone.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:27.971
Hello.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.310
Hi, Mitch Planko.

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:31.019
Bingo! Who the fuck is this?

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:32.229
What?

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.228
Dad?
Hello?

01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:38.857
Is this Mitch's dad?
Is this Mitch, Sr?

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.820
- Dave?
- Hi, this is Dave Lockwood.

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:44.329
Why are you calling me?

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:47.536
I just wondered if we can get
together for a little while today.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.504
- Boy, it's a work day.
- Half an hour.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:57.384
I look different.
I don't like my outfit today.

01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:59.010
Dave, half an hour.

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:01.424
Mitch, Sr. Wants to sit down
with Dave Lockwood.

01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:03.048
- Yeah.
- Why?

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:06.138
I need to talk to
you about Mitch.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:11.599
Hello.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:13.392
Dave. How are you?

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:14.558
Good, thank you.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:17.496
What are we doing here? When was the
last time the two of us saw each other?

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.614
I don't care. Listen.

01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:22.822
I'm getting married to a very
beautiful woman named Pamela.

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:24.326
- Her name's Pamela?
- Yes.

01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:26.784
Wow, you can say "I do"
in English this time.

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:29.244
- What?
- Is Pamela from America?

01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:30.450
Yes.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:31.705
Anyway...

01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:34.037
I'm not going to
have anybody there.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.589
The only family I have is Mitch.

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:39.125
I went to his apartment
a couple of days ago

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:41.966
and told him that
Pamela would like him

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.342
to say a few words
at the wedding

01:04:43.505 --> 01:04:44.597
and that wasn't true.

01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:47.068
Truth of the matter is, I would
like him to say a few words,

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:49.515
if he could find it
in his heart to do so.

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:53.699
I don't know why you
don't tell him yourself.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:55.817
That is a very nice
thing for a son to hear.

01:04:57.685 --> 01:04:59.187
So, you want me to go tell Mitch

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:00.790
that you would like
him at the wedding.

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:02.407
He's going to say,
"Why the hell does"

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:04.162
"he want me there?
He thinks I'm an idiot."

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.907
Well, that's not totally true.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.698
I think he's got
some nice qualities.

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:12.458
I think he's got
some problem areas, too.

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:13.617
What are those?

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.513
You're his friend, you
know him as well as I do.

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.556
You probably know him better than I do.
He's a quitter!

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.457
He has never finished
anything in his life.

01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:21.422
He picks up something,
he puts it down.

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:23.928
He's good at it for five
minutes, and it's gone.

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:26.761
He's flaccid. No gumption.
No get-up-and-go.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.927
His accomplishments could rest
comfortably on an eyelash.

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:32.154
Oh, he'd probably say, "Fuck you,"
if he heard you say that.

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:33.976
Well, maybe he would
and maybe he wouldn't.

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:35.982
But I want him to
be part of my life.

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:39.520
With all due respect,
Mr. Planko, you don't know Mitch.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:42.860
What you don't realize about him

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.657
is that he's a fucking Jedi!

01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:47.406
- A what?
- He's a Jedi Knight, sir.

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:51.289
And next time you see him, he's
going to be slitting throats.

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:02.250
Fuck!

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:15.097
I'm not a fucking quitter!

01:06:26.191 --> 01:06:27.693
All right, let's do this.

01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:30.658
Good morning, Patty-cakes.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.572
Daddy needs a box set
of Law & Order,

01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:34.616
three meatball subs
and a hand-folded,

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:36.497
24-inch samurai sword,
chop-chop.

01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:39.370
What are you doing?

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:41.835
I got this one.
I got it.

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.090
Back to bed.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:02.397
You are in dire financial need!

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.652
Objection!

01:07:05.146 --> 01:07:06.147
Sustained.

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:31.799
Excuse me.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:41.057
Hi.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.902
Fuck me, she's cute.

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:57.703
Here comes the battement.

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:07.251
Fucking nice, Cara!

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:08.585
Sweet!

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:12.677
That bitch bounced.
Beautiful!

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:15.968
Man alive!
That's my daughter, bitches!

01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:18.261
Dad's very proud.
Keep going.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:30.399
Oh, I mean,
what did we learn from this?

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:32.658
Always solve my problems
with violence.

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:35.411
That's bingo, baby!
Five, up high.

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:36.779
- No!
- Yes!

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.674
No, that is not the lesson
that we learned, Cara.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:39.745
It is!

01:08:39.907 --> 01:08:41.580
Violence is cool.

01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:43.541
- Dave.
- Kidding.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:45.504
I'm not kidding.

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:52.921
She did make a pretty
funny sound, though,

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:55.094
- when she hit the ground like that.
- Yes, she did!

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:58.134
But don't make a habit
out of that, okay?

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:00.269
- I know.
- All right.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.729
I love you, Daddy.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.773
I love you, little girl.

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:20.323
Hey.

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:23.747
That ass looks real hot,
you know.

01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:25.077
You like my ass?

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:27.413
Yeah. Tight as a drum.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:30.758
Wouldn't mind putting
my drumstick in it.

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:35.756
Ooh! Really? Ha.
Keep going.

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:37.639
I like how big and fat
those tits have gotten.

01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:42.011
This little calf wants to
get her mouth on the udders.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:47.609
And I think that I want you to fuck
me like you just got out of jail.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:48.975
Roger that.

01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:51.854
And you don't even have to go down
on me because I know it's late.

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:54.278
Appreciate it.
All right, turn around.

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:56.075
- Oh! What are you doing?
- Here we go.

01:09:56.234 --> 01:09:58.420
What do you mean? I thought you
said you wanted to have some sex.

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:02.119
Yeah, but not like two dudes
at a rest stop, okay?

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:06.790
Okay, I got it.
Want to go grab me three Q-tips?

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:10.002
How about we just do
what we always do?

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:16.050
What, do you mean with a lot of
eye-Contact and real personal?

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:17.330
Uh-huh. Come here.
I love you.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:18.848
Yeah. Oh, don't say that.

01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:20.317
Let's not...
How about no talking, okay?

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.469
We can do some silent sex.
Seriously.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:24.471
- Kiss me.
- No, no, no. No talking.

01:10:24.595 --> 01:10:26.797
All right, let me kiss
a shoulder first. Okay?

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:27.372
Okay.

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:29.646
There you go.
Where's that hand going?

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:31.603
- Hello!
- Did you shave your balls?

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:37.071
Who doesn't love a couple
of smooth criminals?

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.494
Is that why there was all
that pubic hair in the drain?

01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:43.365
- I would bet, yeah.
- Why are you still soft?

01:10:43.448 --> 01:10:46.998
I don't know. Can we try the no-talking
for just, like, three minutes?

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.262
That's all
it's gonna take, okay?

01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:50.584
Let's do it like we did it
on our wedding night.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:53.712
No, no, no. Jamie, what are you talking
about, our fucking wedding night?

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.964
- God! I can't do this!
- Why not?

01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:57.920
I cannot believe
I can't do this!

01:10:58.004 --> 01:11:00.348
What the hell is happening?
God damn it!

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.347
What?

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.283
You don't want
to have sex with me?

01:11:09.307 --> 01:11:10.576
Yeah, I want
to have sex with you.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.773
I've wanted to have sex with
you since the sixth grade!

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:14.775
I mean, you should be
a mess by now,

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:16.574
- but things are not...
- Well, let's do it!

01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:18.817
This is new.

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:21.903
Sorry, Jamie.

01:11:22.487 --> 01:11:24.990
I think I'm in over my head.

01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:27.416
I think I'm way in over my head.
I got this fucking house,

01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:29.711
and a job, and a family.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:32.681
I've got you, I've got the Kids, and
I've got a fucking carpool. And rules!

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:35.879
I've got these fucking rules, half
of which I don't even understand.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:39.553
This is impossible.
I don't know how to be this man.

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:41.551
I'm sorry.

01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:47.478
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:49.389
That's okay.

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:52.600
Come here.

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:02.944
Yeah, it's fantastic in here.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.494
It's very warm.
I think I remember this.

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:09.283
Mmm-hmm.

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:16.753
Dave Lockwood.

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:20.170
Mitch!
Where the hell are you?

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:22.927
It's been two days.
I gotta know what's going on with Jamie.

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.222
Call me back.

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:27.055
What the hell is he doing?

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:34.935
Mitch. Hi.

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.440
Jamie. What are you doing here?

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.569
I come here every Saturday after yoga.
What are you doing here?

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:45.195
I am plowing the crap out of
this chick around the corner,

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:47.297
and now we're gonna have dinner.
We're gonna make some scallops,

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:50.291
and then it's going to get ugly.
This chick is a mess.

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:52.594
Why do you have to talk like that?
You have such a sweet side.

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.712
You should let people
into your sweet side.

01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:57.965
Yeah. Listen, I wanted
to ask you something.

01:12:58.249 --> 01:13:01.128
The other night, you were
in a pretty dark place.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.211
Oh, yeah. I know.

01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:03.376
How's that going with Dave?

01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:04.690
Is he treating you
a little bit better?

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.466
Yeah.
He's been very sweet.

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:10.137
- Really open and communicative...
- Good.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.347
He held my hand all night
while we slept last night.

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:13.556
Attaboy!

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:15.771
Did you tell Dave
to shave his balls?

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:18.273
Uh...

01:13:18.769 --> 01:13:20.747
Don't act like you didn't tell him.
I know it came from you.

01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:23.069
Don't be a bad influence on him.

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:24.822
I though you two
might like that.

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:28.321
No, I don't like that.
It needs some coverage.

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:30.327
Yeah, I'll tell him
to grow it out.

01:13:31.032 --> 01:13:32.792
- It was really great seeing you.
- You okay?

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:36.629
I'm good. In fact, I'm much...
Much better now.

01:13:36.704 --> 01:13:37.956
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:39.256
- Okay.
- All right.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:04.816
Okay, I'm awake.

01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:17.586
Fuck it.

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:33.557
Hello, I'm trying to find...
Oh, come on!

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:36.393
Look, bring it to me in the office.
I don't care.

01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:38.307
Relax, I'll be there.
Yes, sir.

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:41.064
Just look at...
This is important. Taxi!

01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:57.501
Thank you.

01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.082
Thank you, America.

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:11.302
Whoa!

01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:37.996
I've got my eye on you!

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:56.681
Go for Lockwood.

01:15:56.761 --> 01:15:58.434
Mitch, I'm panicking over here.

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:00.185
I haven't been on
a date in 18 years.

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:02.475
I'm drowning in my own fear.

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:03.984
Relax and calm down.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:06.942
Don't tell me to relax! You did this to me.
I can't do it, okay?

01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:08.815
Don't move, I'll be right there.

01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:12.531
Mitch?

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:13.819
Hey.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.492
How do I look?

01:16:17.364 --> 01:16:19.833
Just grow a mustache and
lure a child into your van.

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:21.335
Where did you find that shit?

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:22.996
The back of your closet.

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:24.664
Put it back!

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:26.340
These are called jeans.

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:28.351
They've been popular with America's
youth for over 60 years.

01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:31.675
- Jeans to a restaurant?
- Yeah, jeans to a restaurant.

01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:32.884
Look who else can hit.

01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:35.208
In order to feel confident,
you got to look good, okay?

01:16:35.216 --> 01:16:36.684
This is a vest, put that on.

01:16:37.551 --> 01:16:39.974
Okay, this is called
gel or product.

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:41.617
Too little, you look
like a pedophile,

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.478
too much and you look Persian.

01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:45.285
Mitch, I have done everything
that you have asked of me.

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:47.550
I got the jeans on, I got the
vest, the gel in my hair...

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:48.902
You look great...
but I am not going to do this.

01:16:48.903 --> 01:16:50.832
- Yes, you are going to do this.
- Why do I have to do this?

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:52.457
Because it shows
that you're considerate,

01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.323
that you're clean,
that you're American.

01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:56.738
- Why do you even care?
- It's my body!

01:16:56.904 --> 01:16:58.076
It's my body right now!

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:00.082
I'm scared!

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:02.584
There, we have it.

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:05.087
Nobody ever needs to know
that this happened, Mitch.

01:17:10.376 --> 01:17:13.380
Boy, real tempting
to kiss my own dick.

01:17:13.546 --> 01:17:14.547
Ah, that tickles.

01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:16.590
Shh, you're jiggling the sac.

01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:18.934
Oh, you're going to go all
the way back there, huh?

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:20.849
We're going to dinner, not Rio.

01:17:21.387 --> 01:17:23.230
All right.
You got any extra batteries?

01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:45.243
Hi.

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:46.629
Mitch.
How are you?

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.462
Okay.

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:53.048
So...

01:17:56.463 --> 01:17:57.464
What the weather?

01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:59.971
Listen, the only reason I'm here

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:01.427
is because my boss
told me to be.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.808
This is not a date.
This is not a "get to know you."

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.023
This is just me trying
to save my job.

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:07.979
I'm going to go.

01:18:08.142 --> 01:18:09.262
Just sit the fuck back down.

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:12.397
I showered, I showed up, I'm
starving and I could use a drink.

01:18:13.981 --> 01:18:15.449
How long have you known Dave?

01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:17.910
My whole life, actually.

01:18:18.068 --> 01:18:20.287
And have you ever seen him
act like he did yesterday?

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:21.823
Like a super-douche?

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:23.786
Yeah.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:25.576
Uh, I have, at times.

01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:28.963
But I'm really hoping that he
didn't say anything to offend you.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:30.122
He totally did.

01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:33.133
But I like being offended,
just usually after work.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:34.210
Wow.

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:36.253
- Here's the bottle you ordered, sir.
- Excellent.

01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:37.497
Mmm-mmm, send that shit back.

01:18:37.588 --> 01:18:39.340
Bring us two Macallan 25s, neat.

01:18:39.506 --> 01:18:41.304
- Right away, ma'am.
- Right away.

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:43.469
So, let me ask you something.

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:44.845
It's a question.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:47.459
How do you like
working with Dave?

01:18:47.598 --> 01:18:48.645
How is he?

01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:51.644
I love it.

01:18:52.102 --> 01:18:53.604
I mean, he's a brilliant lawyer.

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:55.989
He's the best.

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:02.822
Actually, if you must know,

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:06.826
I used to kind of
have a crush on Dave.

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:11.543
Oh, no, you didn't!

01:19:12.456 --> 01:19:13.456
You're funny.

01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:15.297
I mean, obviously,
he's married, so...

01:19:15.459 --> 01:19:18.463
Right, obviously,
obviously, obviously.

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:20.631
- Super-married.
- What do you do, Mitch?

01:19:20.714 --> 01:19:22.512
- Me? For a living?
- Yeah.

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:25.303
You know, I am...

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:28.685
I...

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:32.894
When I'm not eating hummus
and ferociously masturbating,

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.404
I dabble in light porn.

01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:37.986
- I hear that's a growth industry.
- Yeah!

01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:40.126
I'm just going to get
everything on the dessert menu.

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:42.653
I'm going to order,
like, six desserts.

01:19:46.073 --> 01:19:47.541
Oh, my God.

01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:54.415
No, no, no!

01:19:57.584 --> 01:19:59.177
Do I have anything in my teeth?

01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:03.849
That's a lot of sugar.

01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:05.885
Yeah. A lot of scotch!

01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:08.600
Yeah. That was a lot of fun,
is what it really was.

01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:11.106
Was? What, are we done?

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:12.562
It's only 2:00!

01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:14.727
No! I'm just
messing with you.

01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:17.362
No, let's...

01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:19.722
We'll go to a rave or something.
You want to get raving?

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:21.234
People raving right now?

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.698
- Let's rave!
- Yeah.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:25.408
I forgot about raves!

01:20:25.571 --> 01:20:27.744
Man, I'm messing with you.

01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:29.249
Go and do that? No.

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:31.876
- I do have an idea.
- Uh-huh.

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:33.806
What do you think
about doing something

01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:38.292
that we will really, really
regret in the morning?

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:41.879
You into it?

01:20:44.298 --> 01:20:46.266
Yeah, we can definitely do that.

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:47.926
Okay!

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:50.471
Okay. Let's go.
All right, let's go.

01:20:50.637 --> 01:20:52.560
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:57.019
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:21:07.571 --> 01:21:08.572
Oh, God!

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:11.499
Oh. Wow. Really?

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:13.376
Are you sure
that's what you want?

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.378
Absolutely. I like that.

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:19.462
You're okay with that being on
your body for, like, forever?

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:21.673
I feel pretty good about it.

01:21:21.835 --> 01:21:22.961
How is yours down there?

01:21:23.128 --> 01:21:24.425
It's good.

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:25.635
It tickles a little.

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:27.599
- Rico.
- Yo.

01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:29.158
What do you think
of this turn, man?

01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:32.596
I don't know, man.

01:21:33.347 --> 01:21:34.894
- Ask Tommy.
- Tommy!

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:36.316
Yeah, man.

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:38.019
Check this out, man.

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:43.399
You never did tell me
about your childhood.

01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:45.617
Really? Now?

01:21:45.776 --> 01:21:47.699
With the Sons of Anarchy
between your...

01:21:47.861 --> 01:21:49.488
Um, let's see here...

01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:51.123
Tommy, Rico. Hey, guys.

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:52.373
We are sightseeing now.

01:21:52.533 --> 01:21:55.002
Let's move it along,
please. Come on.

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:56.579
You are such a gentleman.

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:59.185
Now you only have one ponytailed
ex-convict between your legs,

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:00.249
so everything is fine.

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:04.591
I'm kidding.
I was absolutely joking.

01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:07.848
I love your ponytail.
And that little pirate beard.

01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:09.349
Still kidding.

01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:19.435
That's me, there.

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:21.319
- This is you.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:23.697
- Yeah, that is nice.
- Thanks.

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:24.948
Yeah.

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.872
Well, good night.

01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:39.000
Good night.

01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:47.383
Hey, Mitch?

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:48.805
Yeah.

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:51.554
Are you going to call me?

01:22:54.178 --> 01:22:56.306
I thought you said
this wasn't a date.

01:22:58.348 --> 01:23:00.021
Things change.

01:23:07.858 --> 01:23:09.860
That's a cute tie.
Thank you.

01:23:10.527 --> 01:23:12.279
You should wear
that to the party.

01:23:12.446 --> 01:23:13.743
What party?

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.117
Our anniversary party.

01:23:20.078 --> 01:23:22.922
Our anniversary party?
Why the fuck wasn't I...

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:26.710
What about Mitch?

01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:28.925
You said you didn't
want him to come.

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:31.924
- I did?
- Yeah.

01:23:32.216 --> 01:23:34.969
You said you were really
embarrassed of him.

01:23:35.886 --> 01:23:37.126
That's why I didn't invite him.

01:23:37.221 --> 01:23:38.894
I can't believe
I don't remember that.

01:23:39.056 --> 01:23:40.558
You also said that you thought

01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:42.268
that he would get hammered

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:44.454
and hit on all of our married
friends, be mean to my grandma

01:23:44.478 --> 01:23:46.276
and turn the whole thing
into a key party.

01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:47.606
Once, that happened.

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:50.401
And you said he would force
everyone to do Kamikaze shots,

01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:52.661
spike the punch with ecstasy,

01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:54.238
give all the girls
breast exams and...

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:55.951
That was the same party.

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.208
Hmm. Weird.

01:23:58.283 --> 01:24:00.683
Maybe we should talk about your
bad memory at Dialogue Night.

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:03.756
Stilton Coffee House tonight.
Don't forget.

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:06.633
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:08.794
Bye.

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:33.993
Hello.

01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:36.871
This is District
Manager Carla Nelson

01:24:36.947 --> 01:24:38.665
from the Atlanta
Department of Parks.

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:39.825
Oh, yeah.

01:24:39.992 --> 01:24:43.371
Well, we have found
that fountain.

01:24:43.537 --> 01:24:46.837
It's been moved to
1100 Peachtree Boulevard.

01:24:46.999 --> 01:24:49.001
You found it.
Okay, well...

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:52.137
Okay, we'll be there soon.

01:24:52.296 --> 01:24:54.845
All righty, then.
Have a good day.

01:24:55.007 --> 01:24:56.008
Thank you.

01:25:05.851 --> 01:25:07.228
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:08.900
How are you?

01:25:08.979 --> 01:25:11.482
Good. Just on my way
to see Dave.

01:25:11.648 --> 01:25:12.649
Actually,

01:25:14.234 --> 01:25:17.033
all the senior staff is going to
be at the mediation tomorrow.

01:25:17.195 --> 01:25:19.664
So, I snagged Flemming's seats

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.868
to the Marlins-Braves game.

01:25:22.034 --> 01:25:24.537
You, me, beer, baseball.

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:25.783
What more could a guy want?

01:25:29.207 --> 01:25:31.551
Don't take this the wrong way.

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:34.190
I would really love to go to that
game with you, but I don't...

01:25:34.254 --> 01:25:36.177
Are you breaking up with me?

01:25:39.426 --> 01:25:40.928
- What?
- I'm messing with you.

01:25:41.428 --> 01:25:42.805
Oh!

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:45.057
Look, it is just
a baseball game.

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:46.600
They're dugout seats.

01:25:46.933 --> 01:25:49.937
Whatever you have
to do, cancel it.

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:04.493
Hey.

01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:06.620
They found the fountain.

01:26:06.787 --> 01:26:08.881
Yeah, they did.
She called me, too.

01:26:09.581 --> 01:26:10.582
Yeah.

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:13.043
So...

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:15.216
Good news.

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:17.256
Yeah, it's good news.

01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:20.058
Awesome.

01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:22.928
We should probably go,
you know, take a piss.

01:26:23.428 --> 01:26:25.772
Yeah, yeah, let's do it.

01:26:26.139 --> 01:26:27.140
Yeah.

01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:29.939
Except...
Except?

01:26:30.227 --> 01:26:33.447
Except, the mediation
is tomorrow,

01:26:33.605 --> 01:26:35.206
and I've been working
my ass off on that.

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:37.035
Yeah, you've been working
real hard on that.

01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:38.952
And I want to prove to myself

01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:40.954
and to people

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.827
that I can see that through.

01:26:42.989 --> 01:26:44.411
- And you should.
- Yeah.

01:26:44.574 --> 01:26:45.746
You deserve that.

01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:46.956
What are you saying?

01:26:47.994 --> 01:26:49.621
We could wait.

01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:51.631
- You want to wait?
- We could wait a day.

01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:53.258
Push it a day?
Or a week?

01:26:53.417 --> 01:26:55.590
We should wait to switch.
We can do it...

01:26:55.752 --> 01:26:56.753
- A month?
- Yeah.

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:57.920
It's time.

01:26:57.963 --> 01:26:59.636
Really, what is time?

01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:00.845
Come here, Dave.

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:02.392
Come on, buddy.

01:27:02.968 --> 01:27:05.062
This went so well.
Yeah, it did.

01:27:05.429 --> 01:27:06.476
It's kind of surprising.

01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:07.810
Very surprising.

01:27:07.973 --> 01:27:12.149
If they offer you one red
cent over $700 million,

01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:13.482
you accept that.
Got it?

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:15.109
Yes, of course.
Why wouldn't I?

01:27:15.272 --> 01:27:16.273
Why wouldn't you?

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:17.783
- Great!
- Good!

01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:20.021
What's the worst that can happen?
Nothing can happen!

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:21.240
I think it's fine.

01:27:40.672 --> 01:27:41.764
Dave Lockwood.

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:43.095
Did you forget something?

01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:46.645
- Who is this?
- Your wife.

01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:47.803
Oh.

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:51.771
Ummm. Did I forget something?
I don't know. What?

01:27:52.017 --> 01:27:53.109
Never mind.

01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:56.363
It's the mediation tomorrow,
so I'm under it.

01:27:56.521 --> 01:27:57.818
I can't play.

01:28:00.609 --> 01:28:02.703
So, how did it go?
How much money is it?

01:28:02.861 --> 01:28:05.114
Just two hours, so, 14 bucks.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.281
Great.

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:08.542
Sorry you got stood up.

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:11.837
He just forgot.

01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:14.047
Yeah, that's what I meant.

01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:17.376
He forgot me at the coffee shop

01:28:17.542 --> 01:28:20.716
when all I wanted to do
was go and talk to him.

01:28:20.879 --> 01:28:23.507
Which isn't a lot to ask,
do you think?

01:28:23.673 --> 01:28:25.220
What do you want me to say?

01:28:25.383 --> 01:28:27.226
Well, have you ever
been stood up by a man?

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:29.642
- Not really.
- Uh-huh.

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:31.853
Our parents drive
us places, though, so...

01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:33.232
Bottom line, Katie,

01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:36.691
is work always comes first,

01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:38.238
and we always come second.

01:28:38.396 --> 01:28:40.569
And I don't think that's
ever going to change.

01:28:41.525 --> 01:28:42.993
I've got to go home now

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:44.661
because I have
this Spanish test, so...

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:46.322
I can write you a note.

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:48.411
I guess deep down,

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:51.369
I'm afraid that
I'll keep compromising

01:28:51.535 --> 01:28:54.505
until getting the shit
end feels normal.

01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:57.086
And then I'll be
so beaten down by life

01:28:57.457 --> 01:29:01.087
that, just for a second,
I will consider asking

01:29:01.253 --> 01:29:04.177
the homeless guy at the car wash
who looks like Kris Kristofferson

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:05.511
to rub my shoulders.

01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:07.847
And I will, and he will.

01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:10.182
And you know what?
It'll be wonderful.

01:29:11.054 --> 01:29:12.522
And I'll love it.

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:14.103
Because why not?

01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:17.566
I mean,
I'm not getting anything here.

01:29:17.727 --> 01:29:19.855
Nobody's fucking me here.

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:24.201
You know, Katie, this is exactly
why people get divorced.

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:27.279
I'm so sorry.

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:31.120
I'm so sorry.
That was way out of line.

01:29:34.578 --> 01:29:36.455
Do you want some ice cream?

01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:39.799
I'm not getting any
closer to leaving, am I?

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:41.543
No.

01:29:55.599 --> 01:29:56.691
Wow!

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:00.437
It's looking good out there.

01:30:00.604 --> 01:30:02.982
Hudson loves the sinker.
He's been crushing them all year.

01:30:03.148 --> 01:30:05.116
Listen to you, you are
a big baseball fan!

01:30:05.191 --> 01:30:06.238
Yeah, huge.

01:30:06.318 --> 01:30:07.570
I didn't know that about you.

01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:10.831
I was Phil Niekro for Halloween
three years in a row as a kid.

01:30:10.989 --> 01:30:13.833
No way! Phil Niekro is my number
one favorite of all time!

01:30:13.992 --> 01:30:15.414
Why is my voice so high?

01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:32.209
Thank you for coming in today.

01:30:32.344 --> 01:30:33.596
My name is Erin Walsh,

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:35.100
and I'll be mediating
your claim.

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:38.767
Any and all agreements made
during this mediation are binding

01:30:38.934 --> 01:30:40.607
and carry with them
the full rights

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:42.312
and responsibilities of the law

01:30:42.479 --> 01:30:46.529
as stated in Federal
Code 325 A, Section 4.

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:52.455
Kinkabe agrees in principle
to the terms of the sale

01:30:52.614 --> 01:30:55.993
and valuates your company
at $625 million.

01:30:56.159 --> 01:30:57.877
This is their best
and final offer.

01:31:01.331 --> 01:31:03.550
There is no way
we can make this deal.

01:31:03.708 --> 01:31:05.836
Six-twenty-five
is not the end of the world.

01:31:06.002 --> 01:31:08.630
You've just got to know
when it's time to quit.

01:31:08.797 --> 01:31:11.050
Fuck that noise.
We are not quitting.

01:31:11.216 --> 01:31:13.059
I think you can do better, Ted.

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:14.511
I beg your pardon.

01:31:14.678 --> 01:31:16.305
I don't see anybody
headed for the door.

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:19.405
This is just like trying to fuck a
Catholic girl who keeps saying,

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:22.227
"No, I don't want to.
I'm really drunk and you're circumcised."

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:23.834
But she keeps on
making out with you,

01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:25.135
she's not leaving your Fiero...

01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:26.447
It means she really wants to.

01:31:26.773 --> 01:31:28.571
She just needs
a little bit of a nudge.

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:30.211
A little bit of a coax,
little bit of a tickle.

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:31.921
Just to rationalize it
to herself, to her God.

01:31:31.945 --> 01:31:33.037
Do you know what I mean?

01:31:34.906 --> 01:31:38.752
No, Dave. We most definitely
do not know what you mean.

01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:40.628
Okay. What I mean is,

01:31:40.787 --> 01:31:43.381
they want to spend more, they
just don't know it, all right?

01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:44.809
If this really was
their final offer,

01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:46.060
they'd be leaving,
but they're not.

01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:48.428
They're sticking around.
They've got more money to spend.

01:31:50.088 --> 01:31:52.432
She wants to unroll that rubber
at the bottom of her purse

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:54.592
that she put in there
three semesters ago.

01:31:58.555 --> 01:32:00.515
How much more do you think
we can get out of them?

01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:02.768
Ten million? Fifteen?

01:32:03.101 --> 01:32:06.776
Pull those panties to the side,
Ted, and take a hundred more.

01:32:07.105 --> 01:32:08.106
What?

01:32:09.065 --> 01:32:12.285
Do not listen to him, Ted.
He is beyond reckless.

01:32:12.444 --> 01:32:15.994
If we make too large a counter
offer, we risk driving them away.

01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:17.578
Ted, it doesn't hurt to ask.

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:19.427
You would not
believe the nasty shit

01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:20.970
I get these girls to do,
just by asking.

01:32:20.994 --> 01:32:22.667
Honestly, it's revolting.

01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:26.921
It does seem odd that
they're not leaving.

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:28.585
Punch her in the seat.

01:32:36.634 --> 01:32:39.353
You can tell Kinkabe we
want an extra 100 million.

01:32:39.512 --> 01:32:42.265
And that is our final offer,
because we're leaving.

01:32:42.432 --> 01:32:43.649
Fuel the jet, let's go.

01:32:53.443 --> 01:32:55.963
For the record, I did not support
that decision.

01:32:55.987 --> 01:32:56.988
Sir!

01:33:00.158 --> 01:33:03.287
Sir, Mr. Kinkabe has
agreed to $725 million.

01:33:03.453 --> 01:33:04.500
The deal is closed!

01:33:06.122 --> 01:33:07.123
Oh, my God!

01:33:13.171 --> 01:33:14.172
What did I tell you?

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:34.526
Oh, my God!

01:33:35.527 --> 01:33:38.076
Oh, my God!

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:39.280
Wow.

01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:40.536
Are you glad you came now?

01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:42.951
Am I glad I came?
It's like the greatest day of my life!

01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:45.704
Where did that come from?

01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:48.589
Hang on, hang on, I got it.

01:33:48.748 --> 01:33:50.921
Oh, no, they are
going to call it.

01:33:52.043 --> 01:33:54.887
Man, this is amazing.
I can't believe they're making me partner.

01:33:55.046 --> 01:33:56.548
I'm the greatest lawyer, ever.

01:33:56.714 --> 01:33:58.216
What a day.

01:33:59.551 --> 01:34:01.394
So, now you can be happy.

01:34:01.553 --> 01:34:03.030
Do you think they are
going to give me a medal?

01:34:03.054 --> 01:34:05.022
Could you imagine
an engraved sword?

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:07.434
Honestly, I'd be happy
with anything engraved.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.728
A sword or a spear.

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:11.066
Even a shield would be good.

01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:14.358
Slap it, Cara. Cara.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.697
We are gathered here tonight

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:20.205
to celebrate the newest
partner in our esteemed firm.

01:34:20.363 --> 01:34:22.491
David Andrew Lockwood

01:34:22.574 --> 01:34:25.874
was born on March 25th, 1974.

01:34:26.035 --> 01:34:28.379
By all accounts,
Dave was a sweet,

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:30.874
diligent,
hardworking little boy.

01:34:36.087 --> 01:34:37.134
Wow.

01:34:37.213 --> 01:34:38.635
Yeah, I know.

01:34:38.798 --> 01:34:39.924
I love it.

01:34:40.425 --> 01:34:41.426
Why?

01:34:42.302 --> 01:34:43.445
It reminds me of high school.

01:34:43.469 --> 01:34:46.393
I feel like I'm about
to lose my virginity.

01:34:46.556 --> 01:34:47.603
Bathroom?

01:34:47.765 --> 01:34:49.438
Yeah, right there.

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:58.026
Do you want
a drink or something?

01:34:58.193 --> 01:35:00.491
Or warm clothes
or I can get you a drink?

01:35:00.653 --> 01:35:02.053
No, it's okay.
We'll have one after.

01:35:03.281 --> 01:35:05.784
Okay. After what?

01:35:06.075 --> 01:35:09.045
Relax, Mitch, you're going to
get laid tonight.

01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:13.967
In high school, Dave
graduated first in his class.

01:35:14.125 --> 01:35:17.129
After winning a full
scholarship to Princeton,

01:35:17.295 --> 01:35:21.516
Dave, amazingly,
graduated in just three years.

01:35:22.508 --> 01:35:26.229
And after graduating from
Yale Law School with honors,

01:35:26.679 --> 01:35:28.977
Dave clerked for Justice Souter

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:31.438
on the United
States Supreme Court.

01:35:34.771 --> 01:35:35.988
Work is hard.

01:35:36.147 --> 01:35:38.400
I like going to baseball games

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:41.490
and drinking too much, and getting
tattoos at 3:00 in the morning.

01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:43.325
Yeah.

01:35:43.488 --> 01:35:46.287
Boot. Take it off.

01:35:49.994 --> 01:35:53.464
We were not put on this earth
to work, breed and die.

01:35:53.623 --> 01:35:55.663
- No, we were not...
- Don't interrupt me, handsome.

01:35:56.376 --> 01:35:59.095
We are here to have fun.

01:35:59.337 --> 01:36:01.180
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:36:03.383 --> 01:36:04.384
Boot.

01:36:07.971 --> 01:36:10.394
I just think there's
too many rules.

01:36:11.557 --> 01:36:14.811
Think about all the amazing
experiences that we miss out on

01:36:14.978 --> 01:36:17.401
because we're so worried about
what other people will think.

01:36:18.064 --> 01:36:21.785
Why can't I be a professional,
successful woman

01:36:21.943 --> 01:36:24.867
who sleeps with
someone she just met?

01:36:25.321 --> 01:36:26.618
You know?

01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:28.124
I haven't heard a word you said

01:36:28.199 --> 01:36:29.826
since you took your pants off.

01:36:30.285 --> 01:36:31.286
Shirt.

01:36:32.704 --> 01:36:33.705
Shirt.

01:36:36.833 --> 01:36:37.834
You smell like lemons.

01:36:38.918 --> 01:36:40.841
I do smell like lemons.

01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:43.844
Oh, God, you're nervous.
I like that.

01:36:45.591 --> 01:36:46.888
Your leg is shaking.

01:36:47.051 --> 01:36:48.098
That's not my leg.

01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:50.559
Take off my bra.

01:36:50.722 --> 01:36:51.723
All Of it?

01:36:51.889 --> 01:36:53.357
Just the parts
covering the breasts.

01:36:53.516 --> 01:36:55.268
That's a good start.

01:37:00.982 --> 01:37:02.655
Oh, that's great.

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:04.861
At the end of the day...

01:37:05.028 --> 01:37:06.029
Holy shit!

01:37:06.195 --> 01:37:08.664
I am just tired of
over-thinking things.

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:10.833
I'm tired of
over-thinking things, too.

01:37:10.992 --> 01:37:13.120
We should just do
what we want to do.

01:37:13.286 --> 01:37:14.663
Let's do it.
Let's just do it.

01:37:14.746 --> 01:37:17.920
The only thing Dave
loves more than the law

01:37:18.041 --> 01:37:20.840
is his beautiful wife, Jamie.

01:37:21.377 --> 01:37:23.755
Their life is like a fairy tale

01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:27.300
made even more perfect by their
three adorable children.

01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:30.554
So, as we celebrate
one partnership tonight...

01:37:41.064 --> 01:37:42.907
Look, Daddy, it's you and me.

01:37:54.869 --> 01:37:57.622
Would bring most
men to their knees,

01:37:57.789 --> 01:37:59.132
but not Dave.

01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:01.801
He excelled on all fronts,

01:38:01.959 --> 01:38:03.586
putting the rest of us to shame.

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:05.713
I didn't earn this.

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:10.101
The law may be the first
thing on Dave's mind,

01:38:10.259 --> 01:38:14.639
but his family has always been
the first thing in his heart.

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:17.658
What should we do
with each other, Mitch?

01:38:17.809 --> 01:38:19.106
Oh, God, everything.

01:38:20.436 --> 01:38:21.779
We could...

01:38:25.108 --> 01:38:26.109
Is that a...

01:38:37.328 --> 01:38:39.171
Is that a many-spotted
skipperling?

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:40.581
Yeah.

01:38:45.628 --> 01:38:46.754
Mmm.

01:38:47.672 --> 01:38:50.346
You can have whatever you want.

01:38:54.303 --> 01:38:55.520
What do you want to do?

01:38:58.516 --> 01:39:00.018
I want to go home.

01:39:01.686 --> 01:39:02.687
What?

01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:05.735
I want to go home.

01:39:07.358 --> 01:39:08.701
What? I don't...

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.862
I got a meeting.
I got to go.

01:39:16.909 --> 01:39:17.910
Lockwood residence.

01:39:18.035 --> 01:39:19.036
Where is Dave?

01:39:19.203 --> 01:39:21.251
Dave is at the country club.
They made him partner.

01:39:28.045 --> 01:39:30.468
A brilliant attorney,

01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:31.887
loving husband,

01:39:32.049 --> 01:39:34.051
devoted father.

01:39:36.554 --> 01:39:39.103
It is my distinct honor

01:39:39.223 --> 01:39:40.770
to introduce to you,

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:44.195
our newest partner,
David Lockwood.

01:39:55.781 --> 01:39:57.283
Way to go, Dave.

01:39:59.702 --> 01:40:01.124
Congratulations, Dave.

01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:03.088
You deserve it.

01:40:03.956 --> 01:40:05.754
This is not my life.

01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:35.992
Is she kissing the wrong guy?

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.123
I know it's weird.
Just go with it.

01:41:00.304 --> 01:41:01.476
We tried to tell you.

01:41:01.931 --> 01:41:02.978
You ready to take a piss?

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:04.141
You bet your ass I am.

01:41:05.017 --> 01:41:06.018
I love you, pumpkin.

01:41:28.708 --> 01:41:29.988
Are you sure
this is the address?

01:41:30.209 --> 01:41:31.677
Yeah, this is the place.

01:41:45.391 --> 01:41:47.359
- You got to be kidding me.
- Oh, wow.

01:41:51.022 --> 01:41:53.041
Jesus Christ, it's like the
whole city is in here tonight.

01:41:53.065 --> 01:41:56.194
Okay, let's just do this.
Come on.

01:42:03.909 --> 01:42:05.178
How are we supposed
to get this done?

01:42:05.202 --> 01:42:07.250
You just be super cool...

01:42:07.413 --> 01:42:09.694
and don't draw attention to yourself.

01:42:13.044 --> 01:42:14.091
Why aren't you peeing?

01:42:14.253 --> 01:42:15.522
I got a lot of people around me.

01:42:15.546 --> 01:42:16.857
Don't yell at me.
I'm all locked up.

01:42:16.881 --> 01:42:18.358
No one is even looking at us.
We're fine.

01:42:18.382 --> 01:42:22.387
Mommy, that man is
peeing in the fountain!

01:42:25.222 --> 01:42:26.394
Oh, my God.

01:42:26.557 --> 01:42:28.368
The cat is out of the bag, buddy.
You got to go now.

01:42:28.392 --> 01:42:29.453
- Why don't you take a picture?
- Mitch!

01:42:29.477 --> 01:42:30.478
Come on!

01:42:30.561 --> 01:42:32.563
- It's snipped.
- Mitch! Mitch!

01:42:32.730 --> 01:42:36.576
By the way, why didn't you invite
me to your anniversary party?

01:42:39.111 --> 01:42:41.489
Okay, look...

01:42:42.406 --> 01:42:43.703
I feel really bad about that

01:42:43.783 --> 01:42:45.260
but can we talk about
that at another time?

01:42:45.284 --> 01:42:46.803
There is a girl scout
staring at my penis.

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:48.249
I want to talk
about it right now.

01:42:48.412 --> 01:42:49.413
Really?

01:42:49.747 --> 01:42:51.420
Are you embarrassed of me?

01:42:52.124 --> 01:42:55.970
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Yeah, I was.

01:42:56.587 --> 01:42:57.964
But I'm not any more.

01:42:59.423 --> 01:43:01.141
I'm actually
proud of you, Mitch.

01:43:02.968 --> 01:43:04.015
Really?

01:43:04.762 --> 01:43:05.934
Really.

01:43:10.309 --> 01:43:11.481
Attaboy!

01:43:11.644 --> 01:43:13.245
I think that's what
had me all locked up.

01:43:13.312 --> 01:43:14.313
Hey!

01:43:15.481 --> 01:43:17.324
Shit, we got security on us.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:18.617
We got to do this right now.

01:43:18.776 --> 01:43:20.278
Three, two, one...

01:43:20.444 --> 01:43:21.844
I wish I had my old life back!

01:43:21.987 --> 01:43:22.988
What did they say?

01:43:23.447 --> 01:43:25.870
- Do you feel any different?
- No, go again.

01:43:26.033 --> 01:43:28.502
I wish I had my old life back!

01:43:29.704 --> 01:43:31.377
Oh, shit!
Come on, guy!

01:43:31.539 --> 01:43:33.712
We are running out of time here.
Three, two, one...

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:35.876
I wish I had my old life back!

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:39.213
- Bingo!
- Nice! Let's go, this way!

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:40.860
I'm peeing all over people,
slow down!

01:43:41.006 --> 01:43:42.223
Watch it!

01:43:42.341 --> 01:43:43.861
Excuse me,
I'm sorry. Pardon me.

01:44:12.705 --> 01:44:13.706
Oh, my God.

01:44:17.585 --> 01:44:19.383
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:44:20.212 --> 01:44:23.307
Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God.

01:44:23.382 --> 01:44:25.430
Pumpkin! Pumpkin, I'm back.

01:44:25.593 --> 01:44:27.846
Pumpkin, wake up.

01:44:28.012 --> 01:44:30.265
Can you wake up, baby?
I'm back, I'm back.

01:44:30.431 --> 01:44:33.355
Oh, my God, I missed you so much.
Oh, honey.

01:44:33.517 --> 01:44:35.440
Okay, I owe you an
explanation for last night.

01:44:35.603 --> 01:44:37.697
I owe you an apology
for this week.

01:44:38.272 --> 01:44:41.071
And most importantly, I owe you
a fix for the last five years.

01:44:41.233 --> 01:44:42.951
Honey, things are
changing, I promise.

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:47.115
You and the kids mean everything to me.
Nothing is more important.

01:44:47.281 --> 01:44:49.204
In fact, I'm going
to quit my job.

01:44:49.366 --> 01:44:51.539
I'm going to work today,
I'm going to quit my job.

01:44:51.702 --> 01:44:55.206
I'm going to apply
to Kinko's, all right?

01:44:55.372 --> 01:44:57.716
- Or maybe Chick-fil-A or Waffle House?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:44:57.875 --> 01:44:59.548
- Hold on, just a second.
- Foot Locker?

01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:02.213
It is the middle
of the night. Shh.

01:45:03.547 --> 01:45:07.723
All right, I don't know what's
going on with you two dorks.

01:45:08.052 --> 01:45:09.429
That's enough.

01:45:10.304 --> 01:45:11.726
I don't want you
to quit your job.

01:45:11.806 --> 01:45:13.103
What are you talking about?

01:45:13.265 --> 01:45:16.895
You love your job
and you love the law.

01:45:17.269 --> 01:45:19.271
I love that about you.

01:45:20.231 --> 01:45:21.792
I just want you to
come home for dinner.

01:45:21.941 --> 01:45:23.909
- I know.
- And Dialogue Night.

01:45:24.401 --> 01:45:25.994
And to see the kids.

01:45:28.072 --> 01:45:29.995
And I want you
to want to be here.

01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:32.910
I do. You have no idea.

01:45:35.329 --> 01:45:37.252
You don't have to get all, like,

01:45:37.331 --> 01:45:38.753
"I'm going
to quit my job."

01:45:42.461 --> 01:45:44.179
- It's my turn.
- No, no, no.

01:45:44.338 --> 01:45:45.806
Back to bed.
They're mine.

01:45:47.967 --> 01:45:51.016
I love you.

01:45:53.848 --> 01:45:55.100
Hi!

01:45:55.933 --> 01:45:57.776
Look who's up.

01:45:57.935 --> 01:45:59.312
Good morning.

01:45:59.478 --> 01:46:01.276
Hi, my little man.

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:06.823
And how are you
this morning, little princess?

01:46:07.778 --> 01:46:09.280
Good morning.

01:46:10.114 --> 01:46:11.491
How was your sleep?

01:46:11.657 --> 01:46:13.284
Yeah, I know.

01:46:13.450 --> 01:46:14.667
Okay, she's first.

01:46:14.827 --> 01:46:16.670
She's a little bit more vocal.

01:46:16.829 --> 01:46:17.830
Right?

01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:20.674
Are you trying to tell me
you've got a little surprise?

01:46:21.458 --> 01:46:23.005
Did you make me
something special?

01:46:23.168 --> 01:46:24.169
Daddy.

01:46:24.628 --> 01:46:27.973
Hi, sugarbug, come here.

01:46:29.884 --> 01:46:31.511
Give me a hug, sweetie.

01:46:32.469 --> 01:46:33.641
Good morning.

01:46:34.889 --> 01:46:36.891
You smell like a pillow.

01:46:37.057 --> 01:46:40.186
Stay here, talk to me.
Sit on that chair.

01:46:40.352 --> 01:46:41.399
Tell me about school.

01:46:41.478 --> 01:46:43.358
I want to know what you
learned yesterday, okay?

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:44.823
And I want to hear everything.

01:46:45.316 --> 01:46:49.162
Did you know that atoms are
smaller than a grain of sand?

01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.742
How amazing is that?

01:46:50.905 --> 01:46:51.906
So amazing!

01:46:52.072 --> 01:46:55.201
And everything on this
planet is made out of atoms.

01:46:55.367 --> 01:46:57.836
Which is kind of strange

01:46:57.995 --> 01:47:01.044
because I think that means that
I'm the same as a piece of fruit

01:47:01.206 --> 01:47:02.503
or a fish

01:47:02.666 --> 01:47:04.168
or this chair!

01:47:26.649 --> 01:47:29.823
I'm me. God, I'm me.
Thank you. Thank you.

01:47:29.985 --> 01:47:32.283
God, look at that.
Gorgeous!

01:47:32.738 --> 01:47:34.365
God, it's so good to be back!

01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:35.832
Oh, yeah.

01:47:35.991 --> 01:47:37.038
Welcome home.
I missed you.

01:47:37.201 --> 01:47:40.626
Look at that,
two perfectly shorn balls.

01:47:49.171 --> 01:47:50.172
Hi.

01:47:53.008 --> 01:47:55.431
I left my purse.
I would have called but...

01:47:55.594 --> 01:47:57.187
But you left your
phone in your purse.

01:47:57.346 --> 01:47:59.314
- Yeah.
- Right.

01:47:59.473 --> 01:48:03.023
I just wanted to apologize,
because I know

01:48:03.185 --> 01:48:07.190
that I probably came off a
little aggressive last night,

01:48:07.356 --> 01:48:09.450
and I just wanted to say sorry.

01:48:11.735 --> 01:48:12.736
No.

01:48:12.903 --> 01:48:15.076
Don't apologize.
I apologize.

01:48:15.239 --> 01:48:17.287
I probably came off
a little gay last night.

01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:21.045
I hope you will allow me the opportunity
to straighten things out for you.

01:48:21.203 --> 01:48:23.581
Hey, guess what?
It's breakfast time.

01:48:23.747 --> 01:48:25.068
Do you want to
get some breakfast?

01:48:26.083 --> 01:48:27.084
Yeah.

01:48:31.005 --> 01:48:33.599
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here in the sight of God

01:48:33.757 --> 01:48:36.180
to unite this man and
this woman in the...

01:48:44.768 --> 01:48:46.645
Mitch, you came.

01:48:46.812 --> 01:48:48.314
I'm very, very touched.
Thank you.

01:48:48.564 --> 01:48:49.565
You're welcome, Dad.

01:48:50.607 --> 01:48:51.608
Ooh!

01:48:51.692 --> 01:48:53.660
Fuck me!
This must be my new mom.

01:48:53.819 --> 01:48:55.287
Hi, Mitch Planko.

01:48:55.446 --> 01:48:57.039
Good. Thank you.

01:48:57.197 --> 01:48:58.414
She's holding onto me.

01:48:58.490 --> 01:49:00.208
Okay, good, let go.

01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:02.836
Keep away from him.
The man's a pervert.

01:49:07.958 --> 01:49:11.508
Happy anniversary,
Jamie and Dave!

01:49:16.467 --> 01:49:18.611
For those of you who don't know
me, my name is Mitch Planko.

01:49:18.635 --> 01:49:21.013
I was that nut sack's
best man 10 years ago.

01:49:21.096 --> 01:49:22.097
Here we go.

01:49:22.181 --> 01:49:26.231
When we were kids, Dave and I,
we had a lot of big plans.

01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:28.771
Dave, he was going
to be an astronaut,

01:49:28.937 --> 01:49:32.987
and I was going to sell
dolphins on the black market.

01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:34.242
Astronaut!

01:49:34.651 --> 01:49:36.870
There's a reason I'm
not selling dolphins.

01:49:37.279 --> 01:49:40.032
We live in Atlanta,
they're tough to find.

01:49:40.199 --> 01:49:43.248
And those things,
they don't sleep,

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:45.208
which also makes it
real hard to catch them.

01:49:46.371 --> 01:49:48.624
But I think that we all know

01:49:48.791 --> 01:49:52.466
that life doesn't always turn
out exactly how you plan it.

01:49:52.711 --> 01:49:54.463
Sometimes,

01:49:54.630 --> 01:49:56.177
just sometimes,

01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:57.683
it turns out better.

01:49:58.425 --> 01:49:59.768
Dave, I think there's a reason

01:49:59.843 --> 01:50:01.845
that you're not walking
on the moon right now.

01:50:02.304 --> 01:50:04.602
It's because you belong here,

01:50:05.432 --> 01:50:07.025
in your life,

01:50:07.184 --> 01:50:09.357
with that incredible woman
sitting beside you.

01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:17.528
Can we please raise
our Kamikaze shots

01:50:17.611 --> 01:50:19.158
to my two best friends, please?

01:50:20.697 --> 01:50:21.698
To Dave and Jamie.

01:50:21.865 --> 01:50:23.708
Dave and Jamie!

01:50:23.867 --> 01:50:25.210
Happy anniversary.

01:50:25.369 --> 01:50:27.622
Happy anniversary!

01:50:31.375 --> 01:50:33.377
- How did I do?
- You're such a poet.

01:50:33.544 --> 01:50:35.217
- You're Robert Frost.
- Who?

01:50:35.379 --> 01:50:37.023
It doesn't matter.
God, you're good looking.

01:50:37.047 --> 01:50:38.048
Yeah.

01:50:38.132 --> 01:50:39.943
- I'm going to meet you in five minutes.
- All right.

01:50:39.967 --> 01:50:41.014
Okay.

01:50:42.636 --> 01:50:43.888
I took care of you guys, huh?

01:50:45.055 --> 01:50:46.056
We love you.

01:50:46.557 --> 01:50:47.774
Oh...

01:50:48.058 --> 01:50:49.310
Come on. Really?

01:50:50.727 --> 01:50:52.525
Hey, buddy.
I love you.

01:50:52.688 --> 01:50:53.985
I love you, man.

01:50:55.566 --> 01:50:57.489
How are things going
at home? Good?

01:50:57.901 --> 01:51:00.575
Yeah. I mean, come on.

01:51:00.737 --> 01:51:03.866
Yeah. Yeah, it's great.
It's fantastic.

01:51:04.032 --> 01:51:05.249
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:51:05.409 --> 01:51:06.911
What about you?
What about Sabrina?

01:51:07.369 --> 01:51:11.215
Good. It's good.
We're taking things slow, but it's good.

01:51:16.003 --> 01:51:17.596
Is it weird that
I miss your penis?

01:51:18.088 --> 01:51:20.341
Come on. It would be
weird if you didn't.

01:51:55.042 --> 01:51:56.715
What are we doing here?

01:51:56.793 --> 01:51:59.797
We're doing this.

01:52:00.547 --> 01:52:01.639
Huh?

01:52:02.007 --> 01:52:04.101
A little treat from Uncle Mitch.

01:52:04.176 --> 01:52:05.644
Do you remember how to do this?

01:52:06.803 --> 01:52:08.805
Okay.

01:52:10.432 --> 01:52:11.649
Oh.

01:52:17.064 --> 01:52:18.316
- I know.
- Mmm.

01:52:24.696 --> 01:52:26.243
It's fun, though, right?

01:52:28.909 --> 01:52:30.661
Yay!
Let's go look at some fish.

01:52:30.744 --> 01:52:31.791
Okay.

01:52:32.329 --> 01:52:33.751
Oh, God!

01:52:37.084 --> 01:52:38.552
Oh, my God!

01:52:38.627 --> 01:52:40.254
- Ow! What the hell was that?
- Oh.

01:52:40.337 --> 01:52:41.634
Explain yourself!

01:52:42.297 --> 01:52:43.924
You've never heard
of the Bryant Gumbel?

01:52:45.509 --> 01:52:46.681
Let's do that again.

01:52:56.353 --> 01:52:57.696
Why?

01:53:05.529 --> 01:53:08.658
- Mitch sent us a video.
- Yeah? That's weird.

01:53:16.581 --> 01:53:17.958
No entry!

01:53:24.881 --> 01:53:27.475
Steve Driver,
you perfect bastard, you!

01:53:30.929 --> 01:53:32.021
Oh, no.

01:53:32.723 --> 01:53:36.648
Oh, Steve, it's like
Christmas in my ass!

01:53:36.727 --> 01:53:38.167
What are you doing
with my wife, man?

01:53:38.228 --> 01:53:40.447
- Dimitri?
- Hey, join the fuck party.

01:53:40.522 --> 01:53:43.401
- Let's make lady sandwich.
- Okay.

01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:47.363
- Oh, my God.
- Not very well made, huh?

01:53:47.904 --> 01:53:50.828
- When was that shot?
- Who Knows? Probably years ago.

01:53:52.617 --> 01:53:55.962
"Thank you for covering me last week.
Love what you did with my hair."

01:53:56.038 --> 01:53:57.130
Hey!

01:54:00.792 --> 01:54:02.294
You got with a man?

01:54:04.129 --> 01:54:07.258
Dimitri was surprisingly
gentle, and we were very safe.

01:54:07.591 --> 01:54:08.591
Uh-huh.

01:54:08.633 --> 01:54:10.135
He smelt a little
like lamb, though.

01:54:10.552 --> 01:54:13.726
- That pooper shot looked real.
- No. God, please, don't!

01:54:13.805 --> 01:54:15.557
- It did.
- Oh, God.

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:17.108
- Dave?
- What?

01:54:17.726 --> 01:54:19.319
Can you change my oil?

01:54:19.394 --> 01:54:21.021
No, I can't!

01:54:21.104 --> 01:54:23.323
I'm gonna cut my thumbs off
tomorrow, I swear to God.

01:54:23.398 --> 01:54:26.902
And we're gonna destroy that thing
first thing in the morning. Okay?

01:54:26.985 --> 01:54:28.578
I don't want you to.
I like it.

01:54:28.653 --> 01:54:32.328
- Hey, hey!
- Oh! It's growing in so nicely.

01:54:32.407 --> 01:54:35.786
Yeah.
Real in-between phase.

01:54:36.328 --> 01:54:38.296
It's like Sonny Crockett
down there.
