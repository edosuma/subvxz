02:00.150 --> 02:02.345
WHAT'S YOURS SAY,

"HOW CAN I STOP
FEELING SO COMPETITIVE

02:05.090 --> 02:07.115
WITH MY MOTHER-IN-LAW ?"

02:07.220 --> 02:08.289
I THINK I'VE HEARD
THAT ONE BEFORE.

02:08.390 --> 02:10.278
TRY AND MAKE IT
MORE SPECIFIC.

02:10.390 --> 02:11.823
HOW CAN I STOP FEELING
SO COMPETITIVE

02:11.930 --> 02:14.125
WITH MY CHAIN-SMOKING
BITCH OF A MOTHER-IN-LAW ?

02:14.230 --> 02:16.528
I DO NOT
HAVE ANY PENS.

02:16.630 --> 02:19.690
IF YOU NEED A PEN PLEASE ASK
SOMEONE NEAR YOU FOR A PEN.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.665
READ YOURS.

02:21.770 --> 02:24.568
"I FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE HAPPY
BECAUSE I HAVE EVERYTHING.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.570
"BUT I'M NOT HAPPY

02:26.680 --> 02:28.307
"AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL
GUILTY ON TOP OF IT ALL

02:28.410 --> 02:30.503
AND THEN
I HATE MYSELF."

02:30.610 --> 02:32.248
AWW.

02:32.350 --> 02:35.148
WELL, I WANT TO WRITE,
"I LOVE YOU, DOCTOR DAVE."

02:35.250 --> 02:37.184
IS THAT CRAZY ?

02:37.290 --> 02:38.985
DO YOU THINK
HE'LL GET MAD AT ME ?

02:39.090 --> 02:40.387
IS HE MARRIED ?

02:40.490 --> 02:42.219
KAREN JUST ASKED
IF HE WAS MARRIED.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.581
WHERE DO YOU LIVE,
IN A HOLE ?

02:43.690 --> 02:46.193
OF COURSE HE'S MARRIED,
AND HE'S VERY SENSITIVE

02:46.300 --> 02:47.528
AND LOVING
WITH THE KIDS

02:47.630 --> 02:49.154
AND HE WANTS TO MAKE LOVE
ONLY WHEN YOU DO

02:49.270 --> 02:51.864
AND HE NEVER,
EVER PASSES GAS.

02:51.970 --> 02:53.369
YOU'RE BAD.

02:53.470 --> 02:57.031
WE WILL BE OPENING THE STUDIO
IN APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.607
OH, JESUS,
IT'S TIME.

02:58.710 --> 03:01.838
PLEASE HAVE YOUR BAGS READY
TO BE INSPECTED BY SECURITY.

03:01.940 --> 03:03.749
DOES ANYONE
HAVE A KLEENEX ?

03:03.850 --> 03:05.647
I THINK I DO.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.512
UM, I MIGHT NEED
ANOTHER KLEENEX.

03:11.620 --> 03:13.918
HONEY, BEND OVER, DON'T LET
IT GET ON YOUR SUIT.

03:14.020 --> 03:16.329
STAY IN A SINGLE FILE AS YOU GO
THROUGH THE METAL DETECTORS--

03:16.430 --> 03:18.990
THE STUDIO
IS NOW OPEN !

03:19.090 --> 03:20.557
THE STUDIO'S
OPENING UP !

03:20.660 --> 03:24.619
IT'S JUST BEEN SO DRY,
YOU KNOW, THE SANTA ANA WINDS--

03:24.730 --> 03:25.822
OH, DEAR.

03:25.930 --> 03:26.965
KEEP THE PACK.

03:27.070 --> 03:28.230
SHOULD I CALL
SOMEONE ?

03:28.340 --> 03:29.659
KEEP MOVING,
PEOPLE !

03:29.770 --> 03:31.328
YOU GO ON, I'M SURE
THIS IS GOING TO STOP.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.032
JUST SAVE ME
A SEAT UP CLOSE.

03:33.140 --> 03:34.277
OKAY, DO YOU WANT
MY CELL PHONE ?

03:34.380 --> 03:36.644
HURRY, YOU'LL MISS
THE BEST SEATS !

03:38.150 --> 03:40.015
WOW.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.339
MA'AM, ARE YOU--

03:50.360 --> 03:53.693
WE GOT
A SITUATION HERE.

04:02.840 --> 04:06.936
( music )

04:07.040 --> 04:08.371
WHATCHYA GOT ?

04:08.480 --> 04:10.869
CORONER SAID SHE DIED
FROM A NOSEBLEED.

04:10.980 --> 04:12.777
ISN'T THAT WHACKED ?

04:12.880 --> 04:14.711
LOSING THAT MUCH BLOOD
JUST THROUGH YOUR NOSE ?

04:14.820 --> 04:16.708
NOT AS UNCOMMON
AS YOU MIGHT THINK.

04:16.820 --> 04:18.742
YOU KNOW, YOUR DAD AND I
ACTUALLY HAD A COUPLE

04:18.850 --> 04:20.249
OF THESE
BACK IN THE DAY.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.749
SHE WAS PROBABLY BORN
WITH A DEVIATED SEPTUM

04:22.860 --> 04:24.828
AND AT SOME POINT,
LIKE MAYBE HIGH SCHOOL,
THEY FIXED IT.

04:24.930 --> 04:28.491
OH YEAH, AND THEY GAVE HER
A CUTE LI'ITLE NOSE

04:28.600 --> 04:30.727
WHILE THEY
WERE AT IT.

04:30.830 --> 04:32.468
HMM, YEAH, THAT
COULD BE A NOSE JOB.

04:32.570 --> 04:35.232
SOMETIMES PLASTIC SURGERY
CREATES THIS SCAR TISSUE,

04:35.340 --> 04:37.308
WHICH CAN END UP
CHOKING A MAJOR ARTERY,

04:37.410 --> 04:39.674
UNTIL IT FINALLY
JUST EXPLODES ONE DAY.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.237
JESUS, WE'RE ALL JUST
WALKING TIME BOMBS.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.375
YOU CAN POP HER
IN THE REEFER FOR NOW.

04:44.480 --> 04:47.074
MY LARGE FRIEND'S
GONNA NEED BOTH TABLES

04:47.180 --> 04:48.545
'TIL WE CAN
CASKET HIM.

04:48.650 --> 04:50.982
OH, HEY, THAT TRIPLE-X
COME IN FROM APPLEBY YET ?

04:51.090 --> 04:52.785
UH, NOPE.

04:52.890 --> 04:54.551
SHIT.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.059
WELL, LET ME KNOW WHERE YOU'RE
GONNA BE IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.458
IT'S GONNA TAKE A FEW OF US
TO TRANSFER THIS GUY.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.620
CAN'T, I'M TAKING OFF EARLY,
GOIN' AWAY FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

05:01.730 --> 05:03.061
OH, YEAH ?

05:03.170 --> 05:04.762
WHERE TO ?

05:04.870 --> 05:06.531
CAM PING, FINALLY.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.528
YOU KNOW, IN SEATTLE I USED TO
GO CAMPING EVERY OTHER WEEKEND.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.369
THERE'S NOTHING I LOVE MORE
THAN JUST GETTING AWAY

05:10.470 --> 05:13.007
WITH MY BACKPACK, TENT,
WHERE THERE'S NOBODY.

05:13.110 --> 05:15.032
SOUNDS NICE.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.347
YEAH, WELL.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.441
NOW, LISA DECIDED SHE WANTED
TO COME, AND BRING MAYA,

05:19.550 --> 05:20.710
SO, WE'RE ALL GOING.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.276
PLUS SOME FRIENDS OF
OURS AND THEIR KID.

05:22.390 --> 05:25.348
YOU AND VANESSA OUGHT
TO GET AWAY SOMETIME.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.851
YEAH, WELL, EVERY WEEKEND
SINCE VANESSA'S MOM DIED

05:28.960 --> 05:31.428
WE'RE AT HER HOUSE
CLEANING OUT ALL HER STUFF.

05:31.530 --> 05:34.658
HOW'S VAN ESSA
HOLDING UP ?

05:34.760 --> 05:36.318
MISSES HER MOM,
I GUESS.

05:36.430 --> 05:38.193
DOESN'T TALK ABOUT IT
A WHOLE LOT.

05:38.300 --> 05:39.699
WHAT'S TO SAY,
REALLY ?

05:39.800 --> 05:43.839
OH, DAMNIT, WHERE THE HELL
DID MY NEW MOUSSE GO ?

05:47.280 --> 05:49.100
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
SO MUCH FUN, BABY GIRL.

05:49.210 --> 05:52.748
THE SKY'S NOT SMOGGY THERE
SO YOU GET TO SEE REAL STARS,

05:52.850 --> 05:55.341
NOT THE FUZZY
INVISIBLE L.A. STARS,

05:55.450 --> 05:58.385
AND YOU GET
TO PLAY WITH SPENCER,

05:58.490 --> 06:01.516
AND SMELL
YOUR FIRST CAMPFIRE.

06:01.620 --> 06:04.680
SHOULD WE BRING YOUR
BABY DEADHEAD ONESIE ?

06:04.790 --> 06:06.655
OR IS THAT
TOO OBVIOUS ?

06:06.760 --> 06:08.728
HEY, HONEY.

06:08.830 --> 06:09.922
HEY.

06:10.030 --> 06:12.794
HEY, HOW ARE
YOU DOING ?

06:16.070 --> 06:19.130
ALRIGHT, SO,
LISTEN TO THIS.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.573
"HIKES NEAR HUNGRY VALLEY,
DIFFICULT."

06:22.680 --> 06:24.898
DO YOU THINK WE NEED
MORE THAN ONE SPATULA ?

06:25.010 --> 06:27.171
"BE SURE TO CATCH THE INTENSE
SCENERY FROM ATOP SUICIDE ROCK,

06:27.280 --> 06:29.544
"WHICH RECEIVED ITS NAME
WHEN A NATIVE AMERICAN PRINCESS

06:29.650 --> 06:31.515
"THREW HERSELF
OFF THE ROCK,

06:31.620 --> 06:33.315
RATHER THAN BE SEPARATED
FROM HER LOVER."

06:33.420 --> 06:34.580
WE GO'I'I'A SEE THIS.

06:34.690 --> 06:36.954
YOU NEVER KNOW,
BRING THE BOOK JUST IN CASE.

06:37.060 --> 06:40.223
YOU CHECK MY TENT BAG
TO MAKE SURE I HAVE THE STAKES ?

06:40.330 --> 06:42.560
WE RENTED
A TENT CABIN.

06:42.670 --> 06:43.898
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW,

06:44.000 --> 06:45.695
JUST IN CASE WE WANNA
SLEEP OUT ONE NIGHT.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.789
WITH MAYA ?

06:46.900 --> 06:48.561
YOU CAN'T SLEEP ON
THE HARD GROUND WITH A BABY.

06:48.670 --> 06:50.331
WELL, OF COURSE YOU CAN, THIS IS
THE WAY EVERYONE USED TO LIVE.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.930
ON THE LAND
OF THE CHUMASH.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.429
YOU THINK NATIVE AMECANS
HAD TENT CABINS ?

06:54.540 --> 06:56.007
WELL, THEY DIDN'T
HAVE CLIFF BARS

06:56.110 --> 06:57.475
AND WE'RE
BRINGING THOSE.

06:57.580 --> 07:00.310
PLUS WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE
WHAT TODD AND DANA WANNA DO.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.012
JUST BECAUSE
WE'RE SHARING A CABIN

07:02.120 --> 07:03.815
DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO DO
EVERYTHING WITH THEM.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.945
WELL, IF WE COULD
AFFORD OUR OWN--

07:06.050 --> 07:08.109
HOW DOES
THAT APPLY ?

07:08.220 --> 07:09.414
NEVER MIND.

07:09.530 --> 07:13.250
I'M JUST GLAD WE FINALLY
HAVE "COUPLE FRIENDS".

07:13.360 --> 07:15.055
YOU ARE SHI'I'I'ING ME.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.468
WHAT ?

07:16.570 --> 07:17.867
DEER SPRINGS TRAIL STARTS
RIGHT WHERE WE'RE STAYING

07:17.970 --> 07:19.733
AND IT HEADS STRAIGHT
TO SUICIDE ROCK.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.467
YOU WANT ME
TO PACK YOUR BOOKS ?

07:21.570 --> 07:24.130
YOU MIND IF I LOOK AT 'EM
FOR A COUPLE MORE MINUTES ?

07:25.970 --> 07:27.107
( sneezing )

07:27.210 --> 07:28.734
GOD BLESS YOU,
ARTHUR.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.671
THANK YOU.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.948
ISN'T THAT
WONDERFUL ?

07:37.050 --> 07:38.608
WHAT'S THAT ?

07:38.720 --> 07:40.358
YOUR HANDKERCHIEF.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.382
SUCH A LOVELY CUSTOM.

07:42.490 --> 07:46.187
SHAME IT'S FALLEN
BY THE WAYSIDE.

07:54.370 --> 07:56.133
OH, DARN IT ALL.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.707
WHAT'S WRONG ?

07:57.810 --> 07:59.675
"SILENT RUNNING"
WAS PLAYING

07:59.780 --> 08:01.736
AT THE TWO-DOLLAR TH EATER
OVER THE WEEKEND.

08:01.840 --> 08:02.977
I MISSED IT.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.502
I DON'T BELIEVE I KNOW
"SILENT RUNNING".

08:04.610 --> 08:06.043
PHENOMENAL FILM.

08:06.150 --> 08:08.311
SCIENCE FICTION, BUT QUITE
OVERLOOKED IN THE GENRE.

08:08.420 --> 08:10.115
OH.

08:10.220 --> 08:13.678
IT'S ABOUT A BOTANIST WHO'S
MAROONED ON A SPACE FREIGHTER.

08:13.790 --> 08:16.725
HIS ONLY COMPANIONS
ARE THREE LI'I'I'LE ROBOTS,

08:16.830 --> 08:18.923
THAT LOOK LIKE
T-V SETS.

08:19.030 --> 08:21.590
HE NAMES THEM
HUEY, DEWEY, AND LOUIE.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.497
THEY PLAY POKER
WITH HIM.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.067
THEY SOUND ADORABLE.

08:25.170 --> 08:26.535
OH, THEY ARE.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.938
QUITE LOVABLE INDEED.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.735
AND YET...

08:30.840 --> 08:32.432
BENIGN,

08:32.540 --> 08:34.132
OBEDIENT.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.470
MUCH LIKE
TELEVISION ITSELF.

08:36.580 --> 08:39.640
PERHAPS THE WRITER'S COMMENT ON
HOW TECHNOLOGY CAN BE CONTROLLED

08:39.750 --> 08:43.311
AND USED EFFECTIVELY
FOR HUMANKIND.

08:43.420 --> 08:45.342
PERHAPS NOT.

08:45.450 --> 08:48.089
STARRING BRUCE DERN.

08:48.190 --> 08:51.159
WITH MUSIC
BY JOAN BAEZ.

08:51.260 --> 08:53.922
I USED TO LOVE
LISTENING TO HER.

08:59.170 --> 09:00.762
OH, WELL.

09:00.870 --> 09:03.668
I'LL SEE IT
ANOTHER TIME.

09:04.340 --> 09:05.432
NEED MORE COFFEE ?

09:05.540 --> 09:08.100
NO, I JUST
FILLED IT.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.644
'COURSE YOU DID.

09:15.120 --> 09:19.614
THIS IS GONNA LOOK
HOT, HOT, HOT, BABY !

09:19.720 --> 09:22.587
I DID BLUE HAIR IN LIKE,
THE EIGHTH GRADE, YOU KNOW ?

09:22.690 --> 09:24.453
BUT THAT WAS
SINCERE BLUE HAIR.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.528
THIS IS A COMMENT
ON BLUE HAIR.

09:26.630 --> 09:28.598
MAYBE IT WAS
MORE MAGENTA.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.668
MAYBE THIS IS
MY FIRST BLUE HAIR.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.863
TIN FOIL THINGY ?

09:32.970 --> 09:34.790
YEP.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.770
MAKE SURE YOU'RE TAKING IT
FROM THE SAME PLACE

09:39.880 --> 09:41.973
AS THE OTHER SIDE
SO IT'S EVEN AT LEAST.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.708
IF IT'S TOO EVEN THEN IT LOOKS
LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TOO HARD.

09:44.810 --> 09:47.313
IF IT'S HAPHAZARD
IT'S MORE LIKE FUCK YOU.

09:47.420 --> 09:51.083
OKAY, BUT JUST
NOT TOO UNEVEN.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.782
OH, GOOD.

09:52.890 --> 09:54.585
THE "ENTER WITHOUT KNOCKING"
SIGN I PUT OUT THERE

09:54.690 --> 09:55.714
IS CLEARLY LEGIBLE.

09:55.820 --> 09:57.219
I'M ONLY UP HERE
BECAUSE RICO SAID

09:57.330 --> 09:58.922
YOU TOOK
SOME OF MY BRUSHES.

09:59.030 --> 09:59.951
WITHOUT ASKING.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.426
RUSSELL, THIS IS
MY BROTHER, DAVID.

10:02.530 --> 10:03.861
HEY.

10:03.970 --> 10:04.698
HEY.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.961
SORRY, I'M BLUE.

10:07.070 --> 10:11.609
I UNDERSTAND, I WORK WITH
DANGEROUS CHEMICALS MYSELF.

10:13.580 --> 10:16.140
CLAIRE, WE USE THIS BRUSH
TO SPREAD VELVA-TONE

10:16.240 --> 10:18.140
ON PEOPLE'S FACES.

10:18.250 --> 10:21.139
SORRY.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.548
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
YOU WERE USING SOMETHING

10:23.650 --> 10:25.083
WITH DEAD PEOPLE
ON IT.

10:25.190 --> 10:26.657
I AIN'T SCARED
OF NO DEAD PEOPLE.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.853
ANYWAY
IT'S YOUR HAIR.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.552
MY HAIR'S NOT SCARED
OF NO DEAD PEOPLE.

10:30.660 --> 10:32.252
MY HAIR WAS RAISED
WITH DEAD PEOPLE.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.351
ALRIGHT, WELL,
WE'RE DONE.

10:34.460 --> 10:37.566
WE GOT 15 MINUTES.

10:37.670 --> 10:41.766
OH, THIS IS GREAT.

10:41.870 --> 10:44.509
LIAR, IT SUCKS.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.908
IT DOESN'T
SUCK AT ALL.

10:47.010 --> 10:48.875
FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE CRAZY,
IT'S TOTALLY PERFECT,

10:48.980 --> 10:50.948
SECOND, ALL OLIVIER
SAYS ALL DAY LONG IS,

10:51.050 --> 10:52.915
"LOOK AT RUSSELL'S
WORK, PEOPLE.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.817
RUSSELL'S WORK IS PULSATING,
IT'S MAKING ME HARD."

10:54.920 --> 10:57.514
YOUR TEACHER
SAYS THAT ?

10:57.620 --> 10:59.485
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT
LIKE HARASSMENT,

10:59.590 --> 11:01.751
IT'S MORE LIKE A COMMENT
ON HARASSMENT.

11:01.860 --> 11:04.749
I'M GOING
DOWNSTAIRS.

11:04.860 --> 11:08.557
NICE TO MEET YOU,
RUSSELL.

11:08.660 --> 11:10.321
WHEN DO WE RINSE ?

11:10.430 --> 11:11.966
OH, ASS.

11:12.070 --> 11:14.368
I FORGOT WHAT TIME
WE STARTED.

11:14.470 --> 11:15.960
OH, ASS.

11:16.070 --> 11:17.139
( laughing )

11:27.980 --> 11:30.483
DOESN'T SMELL
TOO BAD IN HERE.

11:30.590 --> 11:31.887
YEAH.

11:31.990 --> 11:33.150
MAYBE WE CAN PUSH
A COUPLE OF BEDS TOGETHER.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.820
BUT THEN MAYA MIGHT
FALL THROUGH THE MIDDLE.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.684
MAYBE WE CAN PUSH A BED
AGAINST THE WALL.

11:41.630 --> 11:43.598
JUST ONE SIX-PACK ?

11:43.700 --> 11:45.520
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE
DRINKING THE WHOLE TIME.

11:45.630 --> 11:47.734
WELL, OF COURSE
NOT THE WHOLE TIME,

11:47.840 --> 11:49.967
BUT TODD LIKES HIS BEER,
AND I LIKE TO HAVE A FEW.

11:50.070 --> 11:52.209
SURE, HE DRINKS,
BUT HE DOESN'T DRINK-DRINK--

11:52.310 --> 11:54.278
I KNOW HE DOESN'T DRINK-DRINK,
BUT BETWEEN HIM AND ME

11:54.380 --> 11:56.336
WE'LL GO THROUGH THIS SIX PACK
JUST TONIGHT, MINIMUM.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.805
ISN'T THAT THE POINT,

11:57.910 --> 11:59.605
WE SIT AROUND THE CAMPFIRE,
GET A BUZZ ?

11:59.710 --> 12:01.314
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
TO BRING MY WEED ?

12:01.420 --> 12:03.240
YEAH, SO IF YOU HAVE YOUR WEED,
WHY DO YOU NEED THE BEER ?

12:03.350 --> 12:07.787
MAYBE BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO
SERIOUSLY UNWIND AND KICK BACK

12:07.890 --> 12:10.154
AND FORGET ABOUT THE FACT
I SPEND MY DAYS

12:10.260 --> 12:11.386
SURROUNDED BY DEATH ?

12:11.490 --> 12:12.957
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH
ALL I REALLY CARE ABOUT

12:13.060 --> 12:14.618
IS THAT YOU DON'T
SMOKE CIGARETTES.

12:14.730 --> 12:16.527
NOT OUT HERE WHERE
THE AIR IS SO PRETI'Y.

12:16.630 --> 12:20.134
I ALREADY PRETEND LIKE
I DON'T KNOW YOU SMOKE AT HOME.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.037
WELL, I APPRECIATE
YOUR PRETENDING.

12:22.140 --> 12:25.109
BUT NOT OUT HERE, I HATE
THE SMELL OF IT ON YOUR CLOTHES.

12:25.210 --> 12:26.666
DEAL.

12:26.780 --> 12:27.974
HEY I
HEY i

12:28.080 --> 12:29.536

12:33.080 --> 12:34.274
HEY.

12:37.890 --> 12:39.312

12:39.420 --> 12:41.285
WANNA HELP ME GET THE COOLER
OUT OF THE CAR ?

12:41.390 --> 12:42.709
I BROUGHT A TON
OF BEER.

12:42.830 --> 12:45.287
YEAH, SURE,
ABSOLUTELY.

12:46.830 --> 12:49.048
SO, WHICH BED
DO YOU WANT ?

12:49.160 --> 12:51.264
WHAT'S YOUR
PREFERENCE ?

12:51.370 --> 12:54.032
THE ONE THAT DOESN'T
HAVE SCORPIONS IN IT.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.892
LISTEN, SO,
I WAS THINKING TOMORROW

12:56.000 --> 12:57.206
WE CAN CHECK OUT
SUICIDE ROCK.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.937
OH, WHAT A GREAT
FUCKING HIKE THAT IS.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.177
I WAS UP THERE LAST WINTER
BY MYSELF A COUPLE TIMES.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.601
I DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING
THIS TRIP THOUGH.

13:02.710 --> 13:03.779
WHY NOT ?

13:03.880 --> 13:05.040
NOT WITH THE KIDS.

13:05.150 --> 13:06.913
WELL, JUST YOU
AND I CAN GO UP.

13:07.020 --> 13:07.975
NAH.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.217
DANA WOULDN'T BE
INTO ME TAKING OFF.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.514
WE SHOULD GO
UP THERE ANOTHER TIME

13:10.620 --> 13:12.508
IF YOU WANNA
CHECK IT OUT.

13:12.620 --> 13:14.110
C'MON.

13:14.220 --> 13:17.656
WE'RE HERE NOW, DUDE, I'M SURE
WE CAN GET A COUPLE HOURS.

13:17.760 --> 13:21.491
HOW LONG YOU TWO
BEEN MARRIED, BROTHA ?

13:21.600 --> 13:23.295
( laughing )

13:24.400 --> 13:26.163
COME IN.

13:29.970 --> 13:32.438
PLEASE,
PLEASE ENTER.

13:32.540 --> 13:34.872
OH, I DON'T NEED TO COME IN,
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU

13:34.980 --> 13:37.676
THAT I WAS RUNNING ERRANDS
AT THE MALL OVER ON WESTERN,

13:37.780 --> 13:39.839
YOU KNOW,
THE NEW MALL,

13:39.950 --> 13:41.349
THAT JUST OPENED.

13:41.450 --> 13:43.042
MORE OF A MINI-MALL,
BUT WITH UNDERGROUND PARKING.

13:43.150 --> 13:44.947
WHAT DO THEY
CALL THOSE ?

13:45.050 --> 13:47.257
I PULLED IN TO SEE
WHAT THEY HAD DONE WITH IT,

13:47.360 --> 13:49.681
AND LO AND BEHOLD THEY HAD
A VIDEO STORE AND--

13:49.790 --> 13:52.850
I GOT
"SILENT RUNNING'l !

13:52.960 --> 13:54.928
( laughing )

13:55.030 --> 13:58.124
Now Huey, you're gonna
plant the tree.

13:58.230 --> 14:00.960
Dewey, you're gonna
dig the ditch.

14:01.070 --> 14:05.632
And we'll do it right here
on the side oft hill.

14:05.740 --> 14:09.198
HE HAS TO TEACH THEM
EVERYTHING.

14:09.310 --> 14:10.971
U-U.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.275
IT STANDS FOR
UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST.

14:13.380 --> 14:17.339
BUT IT'S ABOUT AS NOT-RELIGIOUS
AS A RELIGION CAN BE.

14:17.450 --> 14:20.851
THAT WOULD BE NICE,
NOT A PLACE THAT PREACHES,

14:20.960 --> 14:23.178
BUT A PLACE WHERE WE CAN BE
WITH OTHER PEOPLE LIKE US.

14:23.290 --> 14:25.383
RIGHT, NO BIG
GOD THING,

14:25.490 --> 14:27.958
NO CROSSES OR DRIPPING BLOOD
OR SHIT, EXACTLY.

14:28.060 --> 14:31.928
JUST PEOPLE
GE'ITIN' TOGETHER.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.898
ANYONE WANNA
CATCH A BUZZ ?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.865
I GOT MY BULLET IN THE TENT,
SHOULD I GO GET IT ?

14:37.970 --> 14:38.959
SURE, I MIGHT
HAVE A HIT.

14:39.070 --> 14:40.105
YEAH, GO AHEAD,
GRAB IT.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.302
ALRIGHT.

14:41.410 --> 14:44.379
HOW OFI'EN DOES
JESUS COME UP ?

14:44.480 --> 14:45.742
PRETI'Y RARELY.

14:45.850 --> 14:48.671
BUT WHENEVER HE DOES THEY ALWAYS
REMIND US THAT HE WAS BLACK.

14:48.780 --> 14:50.338
RIGHT.

14:50.450 --> 14:52.748
AS OPPOSED TO THE BRAD PITT
JESUS AMERICA TRIES TO SELL US.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.216
JESUS WASN'T BLACK.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.998
'KAY.

15:09.470 --> 15:12.462
NO THANKS.

15:15.010 --> 15:17.672
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA HAVE ANY
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO.

15:17.780 --> 15:19.668
REALLY ?

15:19.780 --> 15:20.940
YEAH.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.280
WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE ANY,

15:23.390 --> 15:25.142
I GUESS I'LL PASS
FOR NOW, TOO.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.309
OH GREAT, NOW I'M
THE ONLY ONE WHO'S STONED.

15:27.420 --> 15:29.980
( laughing )

15:36.000 --> 15:42.633
_ _* doomed
In his Innocence *

15:42.740 --> 15:49.509
* in the sun

15:55.850 --> 16:00.310
* gather your children

16:00.420 --> 16:02.183
Oh, yeah, baby.

16:02.290 --> 16:05.828
C'mon, fuck me hard,
do it !

16:05.930 --> 16:09.127
IF I DON'T GET THE DISHWASHER
RUNNING SOON I'LL NEVER DO IT.

16:09.230 --> 16:10.891
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
FOR THE DISHWASHER ?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.991
MY GLASS.

16:23.310 --> 16:26.347
IT'S SO GREAT TO BE
OUT OF THE CITY.

16:26.450 --> 16:27.644
I KNOW.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.843
WOULDN'T IT BE COOL TO HAVE
TO TOTALLY LIVE OFF THE LAND ?

16:29.950 --> 16:33.750
TO REALLY BE A PART OF NATURE,
INSTEAD OF JUST LOOKING AT IT.

16:35.460 --> 16:37.348
NOT THAT COOL.

16:37.460 --> 16:41.999
I'M GETTING MY
I-NEED-MY-STARBUCK'S HEADACHE.

16:44.730 --> 16:47.665
I GUESS, IN THE PAST,
I DATED A LOT OF CRAZY GIRLS.

16:47.770 --> 16:48.794
MM-HMM.

16:48.900 --> 16:50.663
NEEDY,
ATTENTION SUCKERS.

16:50.770 --> 16:51.907
YEP.

16:52.010 --> 16:55.434
ARTIST SLASH WRITERS
SLASH PSYCHOS.

16:55.540 --> 16:57.371
ALWAYS THIS WHOLE DRAMA THING,
WHERE IF I SAY SOMETHING,

16:57.480 --> 16:59.209
SHE MIGHT TAKE IT
THE WRONG WAY.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.369
LIKE I'M WALKING THROUGH THIS
MINE FIELD OF HER CHILDHOOD.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.278
LIKE THERE SHOULD BE
A SIGN, YOU KNOW,

17:04.390 --> 17:06.540
CAUTION, UNEXPLODED DADDY ISSUES
EVERY FUCKING WHERE.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.186
I'VE BEEN THERE.

17:08.290 --> 17:09.552
YEAH, BUT LISA'S DIFFERENT,
YOU KNOW ?

17:09.660 --> 17:12.481
SHE KNOWS ALL THAT
BULLSHIT FAIRY-TALE STUFF

17:12.590 --> 17:14.091
ISN'T REAL ANYWAY.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.327
WORKING THROUGH IT,
WANTING TO.

17:16.430 --> 17:19.797
THIS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST
ADULT RELATIONSHIP OF MY LIFE.

17:19.900 --> 17:23.108
I DON'T KNOW,
OURS IS MORE LIKE,

17:23.210 --> 17:25.861
WE CAN'T KEEP OUR HANDS
OFF EACH OTHER.

17:25.970 --> 17:28.609
SHE JUST
LOVES TO BANG.

17:31.110 --> 17:33.715
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE,
WHEN WE'RE HAVING SEX,

17:33.820 --> 17:36.072
HE SECRETLY
HATES ME.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.545
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

17:37.650 --> 17:41.108
NOT CONSCIOUS, NOT LIKE
HE KNOWS IT ON ANY LEVEL.

17:41.220 --> 17:43.381
I KNOW
IT'S STUPID,

17:43.490 --> 17:45.355
BUT I REALLY FEEL
LIKE THAT SOMETIMES.

17:45.460 --> 17:47.428
WELL, IT IS STUPID
BECAUSE YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL,

17:47.530 --> 17:49.851
AMAZING WOMAN AND YOU'RE
THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILD.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.222
SO, WHY WOULD
HE HATE YOU ?

17:51.330 --> 17:53.059
I KNOW, IT'S CRAZY.

17:53.170 --> 17:56.731
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE THERE'S
THIS UNSPOKEN THING BETWEEN US.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.569
UNSPOKEN WHAT ?

17:58.670 --> 17:59.967
I DON'T KNOW.

18:00.070 --> 18:01.799
YEAH, I'M THE MOTHER
OF HIS CHILD

18:01.910 --> 18:03.172
SO, HE HAS
TO MADONNA-FY ME.

18:03.280 --> 18:06.408
OR MAYBE I'M JUST MAD
AT THE WHOLE WORLD

18:06.510 --> 18:09.070
BECAUSE MY ORGASM THING
IS SCREWED UP.

18:09.180 --> 18:10.909
SINCE YOU HAD MAYA ?

18:11.020 --> 18:13.079
YOU'VE HEARD
OF THIS ?

18:13.190 --> 18:15.818
SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT
AND IT'S FREAKING ME OUT.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.718
IT TOOK ME LIKE A COUPLE
OF MONTHS TO BE ABLE TO COME

18:18.830 --> 18:19.956
AFI'ER SPENCE
WAS BORN.

18:20.060 --> 18:21.459
WELL, I CAN COME,
BUT ONLY, LIKE,

18:21.560 --> 18:23.528
HALF THE TIME
AND HALF AS INTENSE.

18:23.630 --> 18:25.996
COULD CHILDBIRTH HAVE
REORGANIZED ME IN SOME WAY ?

18:26.100 --> 18:27.431
I'VE HEARD THAT.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.895
BUT I'M SURE
IT'LL GET BETI'ER.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.106
SO WHAT DO YOU DO,
DO YOU JUST SAY,

18:33.210 --> 18:34.973
"YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
HAPPENING TONIGHT,

18:35.080 --> 18:36.877
SO, YOU'RE ON BREAK,
HON ?"

18:36.980 --> 18:38.607
NAH.

18:38.710 --> 18:40.849
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
THAT YOU FAKE IT.

18:40.950 --> 18:44.579
'COURSE NOT.

18:44.690 --> 18:47.750
OKAY, MAYBE I DO
EXAGGERATE HERE AND THERE.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.579
( laughing )

18:50.690 --> 18:54.854
REALIZING, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING
HAS HAPPENED IN MY LIFE

18:54.960 --> 18:56.928
SO, I COULD
BE READY FOR THIS.

18:57.030 --> 18:58.224
MMM-HMM.

18:58.330 --> 19:00.491
YEAH, IT'S LIKE YOUR HEART
IS OUTSIDE YOUR BODY

19:00.600 --> 19:02.568
AND YOU CAN SEE IT
FOR THE FIRST TIME--

19:02.670 --> 19:04.831
AND KNOWING THAT
ALL OF IT, ALL OF IT,

19:04.940 --> 19:07.101
IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN ABOUT HER.

19:07.210 --> 19:09.474
YES, GOD, YES.

19:09.580 --> 19:11.946
I FEEL THE EXACT
SAME WAY ABOUT MAYA.

19:12.050 --> 19:15.417
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT DANA.

19:21.520 --> 19:25.183
I DON'T KNOW, OUR THING IS JUST,
IT'S INCREDIBLY HOT STILL.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.952
HE'S GOT THE DIRTIEST MOUTH,
OH, I LOVE IT.

19:28.060 --> 19:29.527
LIKE WHAT ?

19:29.630 --> 19:31.291
LIKE WHAT, WHAT ?

19:31.400 --> 19:32.526
THE DIRTY TALK,
WHAT DOES HE SAY ?

19:32.630 --> 19:34.791
CHILDREN
IN THE VICINITY--

19:34.900 --> 19:36.595
SO WHISPER,
JUST TELL ME ONE.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.760
THIS SOUNDS SO STUPID
OUT OF CONTEXT.

19:39.870 --> 19:42.430
OKAY, LIKE...

19:42.540 --> 19:45.998
OH BABY, I WANNA
CUM ON YOUR TITS.

19:46.110 --> 19:48.169
SEE, IT SOUNDS
SO STUPID.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.111
( laughing )

19:50.220 --> 19:53.314
(crying )

19:53.420 --> 19:55.911
OH, MY GOD,
THERE'S A SNAKE !

20:00.130 --> 20:01.722
C'MON.

20:01.830 --> 20:03.718

20:03.830 --> 20:06.060
SHH, SHH,

20:06.170 --> 20:08.593
DON'T MAKE
ANY NOISE.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.736
DON'T MOVE.

20:11.940 --> 20:13.828
NATE !

20:29.120 --> 20:31.020
WHAT DID YOU
DO THAT FOR ?

20:31.130 --> 20:33.394
IS IT DEAD ?

20:33.500 --> 20:35.525
IT'S WAY
PAST DEAD.

20:35.630 --> 20:37.097
WHOA.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.758
POOR LI'I'I'LE GUY.

20:38.870 --> 20:41.065

20:41.170 --> 20:42.535
IT'S A GOPHER SNAKE.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.904
I KNOW WHAT KIND OF
FUCKING SNAKE IT IS.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.568
OH, FUCK !

MEDIOCRE.

20:59.120 --> 21:02.749
REDUNDANT.

21:02.860 --> 21:06.580
TERRIBLE.

21:07.830 --> 21:10.151
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

21:15.940 --> 21:17.259
( laughing )

21:17.370 --> 21:19.930
DOES ANYONE KNOW
WHAT ELEPHANT ART IS ?

21:20.040 --> 21:23.305
A TERM THE FLUXISTS
INVENTED.

21:23.410 --> 21:26.504
MY DAD WAS A FLUXIST.

21:26.610 --> 21:29.374
DOES ANYONE KNOW
WHAT A FLUXIST IS ?

21:29.480 --> 21:32.313
FUCK THAT, WHY DOESN'T ANYONE
KNOW WHAT ELEPHANT ART IS ?

21:32.420 --> 21:34.354
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE,
DON'T YOU GUYS READ ?

21:34.460 --> 21:37.054
THIS IS ELEPHANT ART.

21:37.160 --> 21:39.321
MY HEAD IS
ON BACKWARDS.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.250
I FEEL LIKE MY HEAD
IS ON BACKWARDS !

21:41.360 --> 21:43.726
YES, WE GET IT.

21:43.830 --> 21:46.822
TERMITE ART.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.966
LOOK AT ME, CLAIRE.

21:49.070 --> 21:54.633
TINY, BEAUTIFUL
TERMITE ART.

21:56.710 --> 21:58.769
TERMITES WORK
SECRETLY AT NIGHT.

21:58.880 --> 22:02.372
BUT THEY CAN TEAR DOWN A HOUSE
AS FAST AS AN ELEPHANT CAN,

22:02.480 --> 22:05.017
BUT THEY
DON'T STOMP,

22:05.120 --> 22:07.588
THEY INFEST.

22:07.690 --> 22:09.681
GOOD JOB.

22:16.700 --> 22:17.667
LIKE THAT ?

22:17.770 --> 22:19.567
EXACTLY,
JUST LIGHT TOUCH.

22:19.670 --> 22:22.195
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO ALL
JOAN CRAWFORD ON HIM.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.234
NO, I CERTAINLY DON'T.

22:24.340 --> 22:25.864
HELLO, ARTHUR ?!

22:25.970 --> 22:29.007
IS IT OKAY WITH YOU
IF I RETURN THIS ?

22:29.110 --> 22:30.805
DON'T KEEP IT
FOR ME.

22:30.910 --> 22:33.299
GOOD, WELL,
I'LL TAKE IT BACK THEN.

22:33.420 --> 22:36.275
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE
ME TO PICK UP WHILE I'M THERE,

22:36.380 --> 22:37.938
IS THERE ?

22:38.050 --> 22:39.847
NOT THAT
I CAN THINK OF.

22:39.950 --> 22:41.611
OKAY, THEN.

22:41.720 --> 22:45.224
THERE'S LEFI'OVER BLINTZES
IN THE FRIDGE IF YOU GET HUNGRY.

22:45.330 --> 22:47.389
EITHER OF YOU.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.094
THANK YOU.

22:52.730 --> 22:54.766
HEY, DON'T THINK JUST
BECAUSE YOU'RE LIVING HERE

22:54.870 --> 22:57.907
YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS
WITH THE MUNSTERS UP THERE.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.432
I DON'T
THINK THAT.

22:59.540 --> 23:01.929
I MEAN, TAKE
A LOAD OFF, ARTHUR.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.419
OKAY.

23:07.520 --> 23:11.308
NOW, BIGGIE SMALL'S VIEWING
IS TOMORROW MORNING.

23:11.420 --> 23:14.981
YOU EVER WORKED WITH
A TRIPLE-X CASKET BEFORE ?

23:15.090 --> 23:16.580
NOT QUITE
THIS SIZE.

23:16.690 --> 23:19.158
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL ADVANCED
CASKETING TECHNIQUES 101.

23:19.260 --> 23:20.625
SEE, THE VIEWING
IS TOMORROW,

23:20.730 --> 23:22.652
BUT WE'RE GOING TO LAY HIM
OUT UPSTAIRS TONIGHT.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.421
BECAUSE THIS IS
NOT THE TYPE OF THING

23:24.530 --> 23:26.896
YOU WANNA BE WORRYING
ABOUT THE MORNING OF.

23:29.540 --> 23:31.929
I THOUGHT
IT WAS GREAT.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.359
THAT'S NOT
THE POINT.

23:33.480 --> 23:36.699
EVERYBODY MAKES
CRAP SOMETIMES.

23:36.810 --> 23:39.005
BUT WHAT'S WITH THE BIG
NEED TO HUMILIATE ME ?

23:39.110 --> 23:42.739
I DON'T KNOW.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.752
I MEAN, I DON'T DO WELL
WITH THIS KIND OF THING.

23:47.860 --> 23:51.728
I DON'T NEED SOMEBODY
TELLING ME THAT I SUCK.

23:53.130 --> 23:55.598
PARTICULARLY IN FRONT
OF PEOPLE WHO, FOR A FACT,

23:55.700 --> 23:57.793
SUCK WAY WORSE
THAN I DO !

23:57.900 --> 24:01.495
I MEAN, DID YOU SEE THAT
WHAT'S-HER-NAME LEVINE'S

24:01.600 --> 24:05.707
STUPID FUCKING MERMAID ?

24:07.810 --> 24:09.232
I MEAN, HOW CAN YOU
GROW AS AN ARTIST

24:09.340 --> 24:12.844
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE FREEDOM
TO FAIL NOW AND THEN ?

24:12.950 --> 24:14.212
I FAILED.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.174
NO, HE LIKES YOURS.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.417
REALLY ?

24:17.520 --> 24:18.942
BECAUSE THAT WASN'T
THAT CLEAR TO ME.

24:19.050 --> 24:21.154
FUCK IT, WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE ?

24:21.260 --> 24:24.149
THE WORLD'S GONNA BE BLOWN
TO SMITHEREENS ANY DAY NOW.

24:45.510 --> 24:49.173
WE JUST KISSED.

24:57.790 --> 25:00.588
MMM.

25:07.430 --> 25:09.990
WE JUST
KISSED AGAIN.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.742
NATE, GO HIKE.

25:24.850 --> 25:27.114
DON'T YOU WANT
TO COME WITH ?

25:27.220 --> 25:29.359
I HAVE
MY MAGAZINES.

25:29.460 --> 25:31.052
YOU SURE ?

25:31.160 --> 25:33.219
GO.

25:33.330 --> 25:34.490
ALRIGHT.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.228
I'LL ONLY BE
AN HOUR-ISH OR TWO-ISH.

25:39.230 --> 25:40.629
OKAY...

25:40.740 --> 25:43.538
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE NOT SAYING GO AHEAD

25:43.640 --> 25:45.232
AND HIKE WHEN WHAT
YOU REALLY MEAN IS STAY HERE

25:45.340 --> 25:47.399
AND HELP ME WITH THE BABY
OR I'LL SECRETLY HATE YOU.

25:47.510 --> 25:51.401
NOW'S THE PERFECT TIME, I HAVE
MY MAGAZINES, MAYA'S MELLOW.

25:51.510 --> 25:53.273
GO.

25:53.380 --> 25:54.449
ALRIGHT.

25:54.550 --> 25:55.869
THANKS, HONEY.

25:55.980 --> 25:59.017
ALRIGHT, BABY,
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY ?

26:28.520 --> 26:32.081
( heavy breathing )

26:46.270 --> 26:49.899
( crow cawing )

26:54.540 --> 26:57.873
( sighing )

27:17.030 --> 27:21.729
OH MY GOD,
NO FUCKING WAY !

27:21.840 --> 27:25.332
WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU DOING UP HERE ?!

27:25.440 --> 27:29.171
I'M, WE'RE ON A CAMPING TRIP,
ME AND LISA AND THE--

27:29.280 --> 27:32.147
WE'RE DOWN AT THE END
OF DEER SPRINGS TRAIL,

27:32.250 --> 27:33.444
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

27:33.550 --> 27:35.848
I'M AT A B-AND-B DOWN IN
HUNGRY VALLEY WITH SOME FRIENDS,

27:35.950 --> 27:37.884
THEY'RE RIGHT BEHIND ME
A LITTLE WAYS.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.345
I DON'T
BELIEVE THIS !

27:40.450 --> 27:43.112
IT'S LIKE FATE, HUH ?

27:43.220 --> 27:45.154
( sighing )

27:45.260 --> 27:47.751
HOW ARE YOU DOING ?

27:47.860 --> 27:49.794
UH, AT THIS MOMENT,
NOT GREAT.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.458
TO BE PERFECT LY HONEST,

27:51.570 --> 27:54.334
I THINK IT'S REALLY WEIRD
THAT YOU'RE UP HERE RIGHT NOW.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.830
I AM HIKING, WITH MY FRIENDS,
WHO ARE RIGHT BEHIND ME.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.202
YEAH ?

27:59.310 --> 28:00.129
YEAH.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.174
FRIENDS, HUH,
WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES ?

28:02.280 --> 28:03.406
FRANK AND DOUGLAS.

28:03.510 --> 28:04.807
( laughing )

28:04.910 --> 28:06.571
YOU THINK I CAN'T TELL
WHEN YOU'RE LYING TO ME ?

28:06.680 --> 28:08.409
WHOA, WHAT'S WITH
THE PARANOIA ?

28:08.520 --> 28:10.818
WHAT ARE YOU,
HIGH ?

28:10.920 --> 28:12.581
ARE YOU
STALKING ME NOW ?

28:12.690 --> 28:14.908
DON'T FLATI'ER
YOURSELF.

28:15.020 --> 28:16.715
YOU'RE FUCKING
STALKING ME !

28:16.820 --> 28:17.889
YOU FOLLOWED ME
AND MY FAMILY UP HERE.

28:17.990 --> 28:20.254
WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU WANT FROM ME,

28:20.360 --> 28:21.554
YOU CRAZY
FUCKING BITCH ?!

28:21.660 --> 28:23.457
OH YEAH,
I'M CRAZY.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.528
WHOO-HOO, CRAZY.

28:25.630 --> 28:28.292
SCARY, CRAZY,
PSYCHO, RIGHT ?

28:28.400 --> 28:30.595
( barking )

28:30.700 --> 28:34.704
TELL ME
THE FUCKING TRUTH !

28:40.150 --> 28:42.368
I NEEDED
TO TALK TO YOU.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.845
YEAH, WELL,
WE ALREADY TALKED.

28:43.950 --> 28:45.747
AND CLAIRE SAID THAT
YOU WERE UP IN KERN COUNTY,

28:45.850 --> 28:47.750
SO, YOU KNOW, I CAME UP HERE
ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT--

28:47.860 --> 28:49.452
WERE YOU WATCHING ME
WHEN WE WERE CAMPING ?

28:49.560 --> 28:50.982
NO, NO,
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

28:51.090 --> 28:54.127
DAMNIT, STOP
BULLSHITI'ING ME !

28:56.300 --> 28:58.427
NATE, I MISS YOU.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.464
SO MUCH.

29:00.570 --> 29:02.663
DON'T YOU MISS ME ?

29:02.770 --> 29:04.260
NO, I DO NOT,
I DO NOT MISS YOU.

29:04.370 --> 29:06.736
YES, YOU DO, YOU DO, YOU THINK
ABOUT ME, I KNOW YOU DO.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.034
NO, THIS IS NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

29:08.140 --> 29:09.778
THIS IS NOT
GONNA HAPPEN, ALRIGHT ?

29:09.880 --> 29:13.202
KISS ME, JUST KISS ME ONCE,
JUST ONCE, BABY.

29:13.310 --> 29:15.813
AND THEN WE'RE DONE.

29:17.180 --> 29:19.387
MMM.

29:19.490 --> 29:22.812
YEAH, REMEMBER
THAT FEELING ?

29:22.920 --> 29:26.128
FLOWING INTO EACH OTHER
LIKE WATER ?

29:26.230 --> 29:27.322
LOOK, I CAN'T--

29:27.430 --> 29:29.489
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT THAT,
I CAN'T, I WON'T.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.989
WELL, YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO.

29:34.900 --> 29:38.199
I'M SO SORRY.

29:39.670 --> 29:42.230
I'M SORRY
FOR EVERYTHING.

29:42.340 --> 29:46.401
BRENDA !

30:00.360 --> 30:04.319
I'M KIND OF EMBARRASSED
TO ADMIT THIS TO YOU

30:06.970 --> 30:09.734
THAT WAS
MY FIRST TIME.

30:09.840 --> 30:12.331
SHUT UP.

30:16.380 --> 30:17.847
OH MY GOD.

30:17.950 --> 30:20.407
OH MY GOD,
I DID THAT TO YOU ?

30:20.510 --> 30:22.978
WELL, THE FIRST TIME.

30:23.080 --> 30:26.208
SO, TECHNICALLY THAT WAS
YOUR FIRST AND SECOND TIME.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.787
UH-HUH.

30:27.890 --> 30:29.255
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.713
YEAH ?

30:30.820 --> 30:33.789
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS,
LIKE, YOUR FIFTH OR SIXTH TIME.

30:33.900 --> 30:37.097
( laughing )

30:40.030 --> 30:44.034
I FEEL REALLY SAFE
WITH YOU, CLAIRE.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.230
YOU ARE REALLY
SAFE WITH ME.

30:49.340 --> 30:50.830
( crashing )

30:50.950 --> 30:53.305
WHAT THE FUCK
WAS THAT ?

31:06.830 --> 31:08.491
GOODNESS.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.194
RICO'S GOING
TO HAVE MY BEHIND.

31:13.330 --> 31:14.433
CLAIRE ?!

31:14.540 --> 31:16.269
CLAIRE ?!

31:16.370 --> 31:18.258
WHAT ?
CLAIRE ?

31:18.370 --> 31:19.803
I'M SORRY.

31:19.910 --> 31:21.502
I CAN SEE YOU'RE
ENTERTAINING, HI.

31:21.610 --> 31:23.874
AND I WOULDN'T ASK IF THIS
WEREN'T A GENUINE CRISIS.

31:23.980 --> 31:26.574
DAVID'S NOT HERE,
NATE'S CAMPING.

31:26.680 --> 31:30.616
I'M GOING TO
NEED YOUR HELP.

31:30.720 --> 31:33.484
AND WOULD YOU MIND ASKING
YOUR FRIEND ALSO, TOO, PLEASE ?

31:36.390 --> 31:38.881
STAY HERE.

31:42.330 --> 31:43.922
CLAIRE, PLEASE.

31:44.030 --> 31:45.895
GO GET YOUR FRIEND
RIGHT NOW.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.230
RUTH, WAIT RIGHT HERE,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.865
YOU HAVE A FRIEND
IN THE HOUSE ?

31:50.970 --> 31:53.404
THE BOY
WITH THE TATTOO ?

31:53.510 --> 31:56.274
ANOTHER ONE.

31:58.110 --> 32:02.046
I'M NOT BRINGING HIM
DOWN HERE.

32:05.650 --> 32:08.778
RUSSELL, YOU REALLY
DON'T NEED TO BE HERE.

32:08.890 --> 32:09.857
YES, HE DOES.

32:09.960 --> 32:10.915
IT'S OKAY,
I'M COOL.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.429
HELLO, MRS. FISHER.

32:12.530 --> 32:13.679
OH, I KNOW YOU.

32:13.790 --> 32:15.291
HOW NICE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, RUSSELL.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.958
NOW, DEAD WEIGHT IS THE HARDEST
KIND OF WEIGHT TO MOVE.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.869
I'M GOING TO NEED
THE STRENGTH OF EVERYONE HERE.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.062
JUST TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

32:20.170 --> 32:22.365
WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME.

32:22.470 --> 32:24.609
HIS FACIAL CARTILAGE IS
COLLAPSING AS WE SPEAK.

32:24.710 --> 32:27.804
OUR FIRST CONCERN IS ROLLING OUR
FRIEND OVER HERE ONTO THE BOARD.

32:27.910 --> 32:29.434
ON THE COUNT
OF THREE.

32:29.540 --> 32:30.507
ONE...

32:30.610 --> 32:32.202
TWO...

32:32.310 --> 32:33.402
TH REE.

32:33.510 --> 32:35.546
( groaning )

32:39.620 --> 32:42.180
WELL DONE.

32:43.790 --> 32:47.180
HE DOESN'T
LOOK TOO BAD.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.733
NOW, I WANT YOU TO POSITION
YOURSELF AT A CORNER.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.661
IS THIS CORNER OKAY ?

32:57.770 --> 32:59.431
YEAH.

32:59.540 --> 33:01.178
WE'RE SIMPLY GOING TO LIFT
THE BOARD ONTO THE GURNEY

33:01.280 --> 33:02.975
SO I CAN GET IT
DOWNSTAIRS.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.399
ON THE COUNT
OF THREE,

33:04.510 --> 33:05.772
YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE IT
EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.006
EVERYTHING !

33:07.110 --> 33:08.145
LIFT WITH
YOUR LEGS.

33:08.250 --> 33:10.639
ONE, TWO, THREE, LIFT !

33:10.750 --> 33:13.389
( grunting )

33:17.920 --> 33:19.888
WELL,

33:19.990 --> 33:22.197
I GUESS
THAT DIDN'T WORK.

33:22.300 --> 33:26.919
OKAY, I'M STARTING TO GET
A LITTLE FREAKED OUT NOW.

33:27.030 --> 33:30.488
JUST A LITTLE.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.734
CLAIRE, I'M SORRY I RAISED YOU
AROUND SO MUCH DEATH

33:34.840 --> 33:36.899
AND THAT YOUR FRIEND
HAD TO SEE THIS.

33:37.010 --> 33:39.001
YEP.

33:42.420 --> 33:45.287
THE CRANIOFACIAL WORK
IS A LITTLE TRICKY,

33:45.390 --> 33:47.813
BUT I'LL DO WHAT I CAN BEFORE
YOU ARRIVE IN THE MORNING.

33:47.920 --> 33:52.880
OF COURSE, I'LL WAIT FOR YOUR
ASSISTANCE BEFORE I HOIST.

33:52.990 --> 33:56.096
YES, I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.499
AND AGAIN, FEDERICO, I AM
SO SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

33:59.600 --> 34:02.865
NO, IT COULDN'T
HAVE HAPPENED TO ANYONE.

34:02.970 --> 34:05.438
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET IT
HAPPEN ON MY WATCH.

34:05.540 --> 34:07.633
I'M SORRY.

34:07.740 --> 34:09.674
OKAY.

34:09.780 --> 34:11.475
SORRY.

34:11.580 --> 34:14.174
SORRY.

34:15.750 --> 34:18.184
WELL,

34:18.290 --> 34:22.112
I THINK I'M GOING UP
TO MAKE SOME HOT COCOA.

34:22.220 --> 34:24.484
WOULD YOU LIKE
JOIN ME FOR A CUP ?

34:24.590 --> 34:27.252
THANK YOU, BUT THIS REQUIRES
MY IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.

34:27.360 --> 34:30.659
I SUSPECT I'LL BE
PULLING AN ALL-NIGHTER.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.092
I CAN BRING IT
DOWN TO YOU.

34:33.200 --> 34:35.691
CHOCOLATE
MAKES ME QU EASY.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.803
OKAY, THEN.

34:42.710 --> 34:44.007
TEA ?

34:44.110 --> 34:46.806
NO, REALLY, NOTHING.

34:58.790 --> 35:02.556
I THINK SPENCE'LL STAY
ASLEEP FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.

35:02.660 --> 35:04.059
BUT IF SHE WAKES UP,

35:04.170 --> 35:06.422
JUST GIVE HER THE THOMAS
THE TANK ENGINE THINGY.

35:06.530 --> 35:08.088
AND WE PROMISE,
IF YOU GUYS WANNA TAKE

35:08.200 --> 35:10.134
A PRIVATE NATURE HIKE LATER
WE'LL WATCH MAYA.

35:10.240 --> 35:11.537
IT'S REALLY
ONLY FAIR.

35:11.640 --> 35:12.937
FAIR IS FAIR.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.507
HAVE FUN.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.277
I HATE COUPLES
LIKE THAT.

35:17.380 --> 35:20.372
ALWAYS LETTING YOU KNOW
HOW GREAT THEIR SEX LIFES.

35:20.480 --> 35:21.674
YEAH.

35:21.780 --> 35:23.316
I KINDA THINK THEY BOTH
PROTEST A LITTLE TOO MUCH,

35:23.420 --> 35:24.944
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN ?

35:25.050 --> 35:26.312
LIKE, SEX IS EVERYTHING,
SEX IS EVERYTHING,

35:26.420 --> 35:28.559
SHE'S ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT IT
LIKE IT'S THE GLUE--

35:28.660 --> 35:29.957
RIGHT--

35:30.060 --> 35:31.527
BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE
GETS THROAT CANCER OR DIARRH EA

35:31.630 --> 35:33.359
AND YOU HAVE TO SEE
THE REAL PERSON ?

35:33.460 --> 35:34.392
YEP.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.058
THEN YOU HAVE
TO BE ABLE TO WHATEVER,

35:36.160 --> 35:38.196
HELP THEM INTO
THEIR ELECTRONIC CART

35:38.300 --> 35:39.927
OR MAKE THEM THEIR VITAMIN DRINK
AND STILL LOVE THEM

35:40.030 --> 35:41.429
EVEN THOUGH
NO ONE FEELS SEXY.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.895
YEAH, IT'S ABOUT
SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST--

35:44.000 --> 35:46.207
"TODD AND I HAVE THE GREATEST
SEX IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

35:46.310 --> 35:49.575
I JUST LOVE IT WHEN
HE CUMS ON MY TITS."

35:49.680 --> 35:51.033
PLEASE.

35:51.140 --> 35:53.870
SHE SAID THAT ?

35:56.920 --> 35:59.548
OKAY, I'M READY.

36:04.090 --> 36:06.479
YOU'RE ALL KNOTTED UP
BACK HERE.

36:06.590 --> 36:08.353
MMM-HMM.

36:08.460 --> 36:11.224
YES.

36:14.640 --> 36:18.428
OH, SO NOW YOU'RE BOTH
GOING THROUGH YOUR BLUE PERIOD.

36:20.640 --> 36:22.608
DON'T GET MAD
AT ME, FISHER !

36:22.710 --> 36:24.974
IF RUSSELL HAS SOMETHING
TO SAY TO ME, HE CAN SAY IT.

36:25.080 --> 36:26.638
HOW'S MY PRESSURE ?

36:26.750 --> 36:27.899
GO DEEPER.

36:28.010 --> 36:30.114
GOD, WHY IS HE SUDDENLY
TURNED INTO SUCH AN ASSHOLE ?

36:30.220 --> 36:31.209
JUST IGNORE HIM.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.617
WELL, YOU
IGNORE HIM, TOO.

36:32.720 --> 36:33.948
OKAY, IT'S JUST HAIR.

36:34.050 --> 36:35.688
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

36:35.790 --> 36:38.156
HEY, FUCK ELEPHANT
TERMITE WHATEVER.

36:38.260 --> 36:39.750
I MEAN, I ALREADY FORGOT
WHO WAS THE ELEPHANT

36:39.860 --> 36:41.054
AND WHO WAS
THE TERMITE.

36:41.160 --> 36:42.525
IT'S NOT THAT, OLIVIER,
IT'S JUST,

36:42.630 --> 36:43.892
WHAT'S THE POINT OF
TRYING TO HUMILIATE--

36:44.000 --> 36:45.228
I WAS THE ELEPHANT.

36:45.330 --> 36:46.729
AND WHY DO YOU
EVEN GIVE A SHIT ?

36:46.830 --> 36:48.366
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY TEACHER
AND I RESPECT YOU.

36:48.470 --> 36:50.995
DON'T YOU FUCKING
RESPECT ME.

36:51.100 --> 36:53.204
I'M AN IDIOT, SEE ?

36:53.310 --> 36:54.800
I'M NOT GOD.

36:54.910 --> 36:57.970
DON'T YOU EVER RESPECT ANYONE
EXCEPT YOUR FUCKING SELF.

36:58.080 --> 37:01.641
FUCKING BABIES.

37:21.300 --> 37:23.268
HEY, MOM.

37:23.370 --> 37:25.804
HELLO, DEAR,
I WASHED YOUR SHEETS.

37:26.810 --> 37:28.300
WHAT'S THAT ?

37:28.410 --> 37:29.536
ARTHUR'S
HANDKERCHIEF.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.130
YOU'RE DOING
HIS LAUNDRY FOR HIM ?

37:31.240 --> 37:33.049
IT MUST HAVE GOTTEN
MIXED INTO MY THINGS.

37:33.150 --> 37:34.947
THAT'S GROSS.

37:35.050 --> 37:36.677
IT'S JUST A HANKY.

37:36.780 --> 37:39.112
I KNOW,
AND HANKIES ARE GROSS.

37:39.220 --> 37:42.109
FIRST OF ALL, THE WORD
IS GROSS, "HANKY".

37:42.220 --> 37:43.585
IT'S JUST A WORD.

37:43.690 --> 37:45.487
AND SECOND OF ALL,
HANKIES THEMSELVES ARE GROSS.

37:45.590 --> 37:48.024
A SNOT COVERED RAG THAT
SITS IN YOUR POCKET ALL DAY.

37:48.130 --> 37:49.392
THAT WILL BE FINE !

37:49.500 --> 37:50.922
WHO KNOWS WHERE THE SNOT IS,
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.

37:51.030 --> 37:52.520
YOU PUT IT BACK IN YOUR POCKET
AND SAVE IT FOR LATER.

37:52.630 --> 37:54.359
I MEAN, MOM,
NOT ALL PROGRESS IS BAD.

37:54.470 --> 37:56.791
THERE'S KLEENEX,
HELLO ?

38:50.160 --> 38:52.048
I KNOW.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.219

38:54.330 --> 38:56.423
NOW, YOU'RE JUST
TRYING TO BE CUTE.

38:56.530 --> 38:59.727
OH, FORGIVE ME, HOT.

38:59.830 --> 39:02.799
YES, OF COURSE I DO.

39:02.900 --> 39:05.209
MORE SO NOW
THAN EVER.

39:05.310 --> 39:09.633
MOM'S VACUUMING
MY ROOM.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.869
I GOTTA GO.

39:13.980 --> 39:16.414
OKAY.

39:16.520 --> 39:20.081
SHUT UP,
NO, I'M NOT.

39:21.960 --> 39:25.259
I AM NOT,
I'M NOT, STOP.

39:25.360 --> 39:30.297
I'M HANGING UP,
GOODBYE.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.061

39:32.170 --> 39:33.296
PHIL ?

39:33.400 --> 39:34.435
NO, RUSSELL.

39:34.540 --> 39:37.031
THE GAY ONE ?

39:37.140 --> 39:38.562
WHAT ?!

39:38.670 --> 39:40.228
RUSSELL, THE GUY
IN YOUR ROOM THE OTHER DAY ?

39:40.340 --> 39:41.773
WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK HE'S GAY ?

39:41.880 --> 39:44.599
OH, WE CAN SMELL IT
ON EACH OTHER.

39:44.710 --> 39:45.779
DAVID !

39:45.880 --> 39:48.075
UM, LET'S SEE,
YOU TOLD ME HE WAS ?

39:48.180 --> 39:50.045
YOU'D REFERRED TO HIM BEFORE
AS "MY GAY FRIEND RUSSELL,"

39:50.150 --> 39:51.071
I BELIEVE.

39:51.180 --> 39:52.909
OH.

39:53.020 --> 39:54.510
HE'S NOT ANYMORE ?

39:54.620 --> 39:58.920
NO, HE NEVER WAS,
I WAS JUST CONFUSED.

40:04.160 --> 40:05.718
CLAIRE, LISTEN.

40:05.830 --> 40:08.162
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,
I DATED GIRLS.

40:08.270 --> 40:09.294
WE'RE IN COLLEGE.

40:09.400 --> 40:10.765
AND WHEN I WAS
IN COLLEGE.

40:10.870 --> 40:11.939
AND AFTER COLLEGE.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.099
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS
AND WHILE I WAS TRYING

40:14.210 --> 40:16.906
TO FIGURE IT OUT I KEPT GOING
BACK AND FORTH IN MY MIND,

40:17.010 --> 40:19.478
YOU DON'T GET IT, THERE'S NO
BACK AND FORTH WITH RUSSELL.

40:19.580 --> 40:21.673
HE'S NEVER BEEN GAY,
I WAS JUST ASSUMING.

40:21.780 --> 40:24.578
HE HAS NEVER
BEEN GAY.

40:24.690 --> 40:27.113
HE'S NEVER EVEN HAD SEX
WITH ANYONE BEFORE ME.

40:27.220 --> 40:28.949
OKAY, MY MISTAKE.

40:29.060 --> 40:32.450
I CAN'T MAKE A PHONE CALL
IN THIS FUCKING HOUSE,

40:32.560 --> 40:33.857
BECAUSE I DON'T GET
CELL RECEPTION ANYWHERE

40:33.960 --> 40:36.622
AND MY MOTHER'S
IN MY FUCKING ROOM...

40:39.970 --> 40:43.098
WHAT AGE DID YOU COMPLETELY
STOP SLEEPING WITH WOMEN ?

40:43.200 --> 40:45.168
I MEAN, I KNOW WHEN YOU
FIRST SLEPT WITH THAT BOY,

40:45.270 --> 40:47.704
BUT DID YOU OVERLAP
AFTER THAT ?

40:47.810 --> 40:51.439
YEAH.

40:52.650 --> 40:54.402
THERE WERE LIKE 10 YEARS
WHEN I WASN'T SURE,

40:54.520 --> 40:56.545
OR I WAS SURE,
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE SURE,

40:56.650 --> 40:58.208
AND I WAS WITH
SOME WOMEN.

40:58.320 --> 40:59.878
PRETTY SERIOUSLY.

40:59.990 --> 41:01.014
WELL, JENNER.

41:01.120 --> 41:03.714
YEAH.

41:06.390 --> 41:08.119
I WAS WITH
A TON OF WOMEN.

41:08.230 --> 41:09.629
I LIKED
FUCKING WOMEN.

41:09.730 --> 41:11.618
YEAH, I KNOW,
YOU'VE TOLD ME.

41:11.730 --> 41:15.837
WHAT I MEAN WAS, I DID THIS
WHOLE EMOTIONAL DEAL WITH GIRLS.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.794
WOMEN.

41:17.900 --> 41:18.798
LIKE...

41:18.910 --> 41:20.969
HONEY, I COULD
REALLY THINK ABOUT

41:21.070 --> 41:23.129
SPENDING THE REST
OF MY LIFE WITH YOU.

41:23.240 --> 41:25.640
I DON'T KNOW,

41:25.750 --> 41:28.446
BUY SOME LAND
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ?

41:28.550 --> 41:31.075
AND BUILD A HOUSE,
DESIGN IT OURSELVES.

41:31.180 --> 41:34.013
WHAT ABOUT WILLEM FOR A BOY
AND COCO FOR A GIRL,

41:34.120 --> 41:37.783
OR WILLEM AND MAX
IF WE HAVE TWIN BOYS.

41:37.890 --> 41:41.428
OR IF WE HAVE TWIN GIRLS,
COCO AND CLEMENTINE.

41:41.530 --> 41:42.849
ARE YOU SURE THEY DIDN'T
KNOW YOU WERE GAY ?

41:42.960 --> 41:44.188
NO, THEY DIDN'T
EVEN SUSPECT.

41:44.300 --> 41:45.722
THEY THOUGHT
I WAS THEIR MAN,

41:45.830 --> 41:47.991
THEY LOOKED RIGHT
BACK INTO MY EYES.

41:48.100 --> 41:50.637
ALL THE WHILE I WAS
JUST TRYING THAT GUY ON

41:50.740 --> 41:54.005
TO SEE IF I COULD
MAKE IT FIT.

42:03.350 --> 42:05.409
( male on tv)
Oh, yeah !

42:05.520 --> 42:09.183
Okay, right there,
right there !

42:12.290 --> 42:13.826
SHE'S DOWN.

42:13.930 --> 42:15.329

42:15.430 --> 42:17.193
YOU GUYS WANNA
TAKE YOUR TURN ?

42:17.300 --> 42:19.427
WE'RE LEAVING TODAY--

42:19.530 --> 42:21.020
WE SHOULD PACK.

42:21.130 --> 42:22.859
OH, YOU CAN PACK LATER,
GO TAKE THE HOUR.

42:22.970 --> 42:23.698
GO ON.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.233
IF SHE WAKES UP--

42:25.340 --> 42:26.432
SHE'LL BE FINE.

42:26.540 --> 42:28.030
GO, YOU GUYS,
HAVE FUN.

42:28.140 --> 42:30.938
WHAT DO YOU SAY ?

42:38.820 --> 42:40.981
SHE CAN'T COME,
YOU KNOW ?

42:43.320 --> 42:45.049
REALLY ?

42:45.160 --> 42:47.082
REALLY.

42:47.190 --> 42:48.384
PRETTY.

42:48.490 --> 42:50.299
YEAH.

42:50.400 --> 42:53.028
DO YOU WANT TO, UH ?

42:53.130 --> 42:55.530
NO, NOT REALLY.

42:55.640 --> 42:59.337
I'D BE AFRAID
TO TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF.

42:59.440 --> 43:02.079
SOMETHING COULD
CRAWL ON ME.

43:02.180 --> 43:06.799
WE'RE NOT REALLY
TODD AND DANA, ARE WE ?

43:09.380 --> 43:11.746
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?

43:11.850 --> 43:14.512
I WAS JUST ACKNOWLEDGING,
I GUESS, THAT THE REASONS

43:14.620 --> 43:17.384
WE'RE TOGETHER
AREN'T THE SAME AS--

43:17.490 --> 43:18.980
SAY IT.

43:19.090 --> 43:21.479
WHAT, THERE'S
NOTHING TO SAY.

43:21.590 --> 43:23.194
SAY IT, NATE.

43:23.300 --> 43:25.188
WHY ARE YOU
EVEN WITH ME ?

43:25.300 --> 43:27.268
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
HERE FOR ?

43:27.370 --> 43:29.190
YOU MEAN UP
ON THIS TRIP, WHAT ?

43:29.300 --> 43:31.905
WHY DID YOU
MARRY ME ?

43:32.010 --> 43:33.762
YOU THINK MAYA
AND I NEED YOU ?

43:33.870 --> 43:36.407
YOU DON'T WANT THIS, I MEAN,
YOU WANT YOUR DAUGHTER.

43:36.510 --> 43:38.034
BUT YOU DON'T
WANT ME, DO YOU ?

43:38.140 --> 43:39.676
JESUS, I CAN'T
FUCKING SAY ANYTHING !

43:39.780 --> 43:41.042
YOU CAN'T SAY
HURTFUL THINGS, NO.

43:41.150 --> 43:42.378
AND IT'S TOTALLY
HURTFUL TO SUGGEST

43:42.480 --> 43:43.708
WE'RE ONLY TOGETHER
BECAUSE OF MAYA.

43:43.820 --> 43:45.139
LISA, I'M NOT TRYING
TO HURT YOU, OKAY ?

43:45.250 --> 43:46.945
THAT WAS ME JUST THINKING
SOMETHING, OPENING MY MOUTH,

43:47.050 --> 43:48.347
SAY IT, YOU KNOW
HOW FRIENDS DO ?

43:48.450 --> 43:50.088
BUT IN ORDER FOR ME TO BE
ABLE TO DO THAT WITH YOU,

43:50.190 --> 43:51.726
THAT WOULD MEAN
YOU'D HAVE TO LIKE ME.

43:51.830 --> 43:52.979
OH, THAT'S STUPID.

43:53.090 --> 43:54.387
NO, IT'S NOT, LISA,
THINK ABOUT IT,

43:54.490 --> 43:55.923
THE SECOND
I SAY SOMETHING,

43:56.030 --> 43:58.123
IF IT DOESN'T FIT INTO YOUR
FUCKING FAIRY TALE IDEA OF--

43:58.230 --> 44:00.061
HEY, THIS IS NO FAIRY TALE,
THAT I KNOW.

44:00.170 --> 44:02.730
YOU MADE UP A STORY ABOUT US
AND YOU CAST ME IN THIS ROLE.

44:02.840 --> 44:04.262
YOU CAST YOURSELF
IN THAT ROLE.

44:04.370 --> 44:05.803
WHAT, MAKING THE MOTHER OF
MY CHILD HAPPY IS A ROLE ?

44:05.910 --> 44:07.400
I DON'T THINK SO,
OKAY ?

44:07.510 --> 44:10.001
BUT YOU, YOU HAVE THIS TOTALLY
NARROW PATH I CAN WALK ON,

44:10.110 --> 44:12.044
WHERE I'M ON YOUR,
YOUR FUCKING LEASH !

44:12.150 --> 44:14.300
NO SMOKING,

44:14.410 --> 44:16.344
NO SMOKING POT WITHOUT
PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL !

44:16.450 --> 44:17.747
SMOKE YOUR
FUCKING LUNGS OUT !

44:17.850 --> 44:19.886
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT SMOKING, LISA !

44:19.990 --> 44:22.356
I GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT BEING MYSELF.

44:22.460 --> 44:25.156
ABOUT SAYING WHAT I NEED TO SAY
OR EVEN WHAT I ACCIDENTALLY SAY

44:25.260 --> 44:28.388
AND NOT HAVE YOU FUCKIN'
FREAK OUT ON ME, OKAY ?

44:29.730 --> 44:33.029
I'M SORRY, THEN.

44:34.670 --> 44:36.865
FUCK.

44:58.460 --> 45:00.758
I'M SORRY.

45:06.670 --> 45:08.023
KISS ME.

45:08.130 --> 45:10.098
WHAT, NO--

45:10.200 --> 45:12.065
HONEY, I WANT TO GET
BETTER AT THIS.

45:12.170 --> 45:15.833
HELP ME, OKAY ?

45:38.400 --> 45:39.628

JEANS OFF.

45:39.730 --> 45:41.266
UH.

45:41.370 --> 45:42.234
TAKE 'EM OFF.

45:42.340 --> 45:43.364

45:43.470 --> 45:46.530
YEAH, LIE DOWN
ON THAT ROCK.

45:46.640 --> 45:49.803
THAT ROCK IS HARD
AND COLD.

45:53.780 --> 45:56.840
LIE DOWN ON THAT.

46:00.620 --> 46:02.781
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

46:04.990 --> 46:07.049
I WANNA FUCK YOU
ON THIS ROCK.

46:07.860 --> 46:09.327
BUT FIRST...

46:10.160 --> 46:11.696
I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU SCREAM,

46:11.800 --> 46:13.768
SO THAT EVERYBODY BACK
AT CAMP CAN HEAR YOU,

46:14.500 --> 46:15.899
AND THEN,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.139
WHEN YOU'RE EXHAUSTED,
AND YOU'RE LAYING HERE,

46:18.240 --> 46:20.367
COMING DOWN.

46:20.470 --> 46:22.609
I'M GOING
TO FUCK YOU.

46:22.710 --> 46:24.507
RIGHT HERE...

46:53.970 --> 46:56.302
BACK IN SEATTLE,
WHEN WE HAD SEX LIKE THAT.

46:59.950 --> 47:01.542

DESIGNER'S HOUSE,

47:03.880 --> 47:07.589

47:10.590 --> 47:12.558
SHE HAD JUST
BROKEN IT OFF WITH YOU

47:12.660 --> 47:14.548
AND YOU WERE SO DRUNK
AND PISSED.

47:14.660 --> 47:18.790
AND YOU CAME HOME AND WE ENDED
UP HAVING THE MOST AMAZING SEX

47:18.900 --> 47:20.162

IN MY LIFE.

47:24.300 --> 47:26.029

47:32.250 --> 47:34.275
THE OTHER TIME WAS THE NIGHT
AFTER YOU RAN THE MARATHON

47:34.380 --> 47:35.415
FOR THE FIRST TIME.
