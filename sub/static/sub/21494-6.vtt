WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Hey, everybody. I'm Joey Fatone, if you don't know who I am.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
But right now on "Impractical Jokers After Party,"

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
we've got Joe, we've got Q.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
We also got Murrzy doats and mosey doats.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Also, we have a special guest,

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
an "IJ" superfan, Victoria Justice.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
And we're talking all about tonight's episode

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
that you just watched, so stick 'em up, dickweed!

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Pa-poo! Pa-poo!

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
â™ªâ™ª

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Whoo! All right. We're here at the Flagship Brewery

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
in Staten Island, New York.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
And joining me today, of course, to talk about the show

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
are three of the stars of "Impractical Jokers,"

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Joseph, that guy Brian Quinn, Quinn,

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
and Murrzy doats and mosey doats.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
-Hello, Joey. -You guys doing all right?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Very good, Joe! How are you tonight?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
-I'm fantastic! -Fatone is in the house!

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
I had a coffee colonic, and I'm ready to roll, baby!

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
-Ready to roll! -That's great.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
-Yellow is your color! -Let's talk about it.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
-Look at that! -I'm a bee. I wanna sting.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
-Yeah! -Hey! Botanical Gardens.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
That happened tonight. That happened tonight.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
-That happened. In Brooklyn. -That was in Brooklyn.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
-You wore the shirt. You knew. -I love that!

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
It's the Brooklyn Botanic Garden...

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yes.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
...not to be confused with the Bronx Botanical Gardens.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
-No. -Two totally different places.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
-Two totally different things. -It's a singular botanic?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
It's one botanic.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
There were a lot of flowers there.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
But they're  all in one botanic.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
-All right. -Follow-up question.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
What's a botanic? [ Laughter ]

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
-Anyone? Anyone? -It's a friendship.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
[ Overlapping dialogue ]

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Okay. All right.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
[ Laughter ]

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
As far as the challenge, was this one a lot more challenging

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
or just a lot more laid-back and relaxed or...?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Well, this was great. People wanted to come up to us.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
"Ooh, you've got flowers? Let me see what you've got."

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
They were highly interested.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
"What botanics do you got there?"

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
-People had real questions... -Yes!

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
...about these botanics, and we didn't know anything.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
-Then you just made stuff up. -We're not botanic masters.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
And that's another thing with a lot of times,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
a lot of the episodes, is where you literally --

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
They think you know what you're doing,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
and you're just making stuff up on the fly.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
The last time we interacted with flowers

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
was when we worked in the nursery.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
-Do you remember that? -Oh, I remember.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Yes. And we admitted to smoking up.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Sal played the troll. He danced around. It was great.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
-Yes. Yes. -And was it a lot of fun

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
getting all your frustration out, Murr,

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
by punching those plants?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
It was -- It was so much fun.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
That guy -- He just -- You go with it,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
and he started taking it out on the plants.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
He's a city worker. He knows what it's like.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Plus, you just try and stop people in Brooklyn

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
-from punching flowers. -I was about to say,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
it looked like he was getting a lot of frustration out.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
That guy was punching flowers before he came to the garden.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah, yeah. We found the right guy to punch a flower.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
And then it just seemed for you, Joe,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I mean, as far as the reaction on that couple.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
-Did you -- -That was so...

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Like, they requested -- The pictures,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
when you just kept going up and like, "Okay, wait. Hang on a second."

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
We didn't have time to show it, yeah.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
I actually ended up taking nine pictures of that couple.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
-Did you really? -It was insane.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I worked around the whole way with them,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
and then they were leaving. They're like, "Get one more."

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
And they were literally down the --

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
out where our cameras can't even see them.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
I'm like, "Guys!"

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
They turned around, and I took a picture.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
-They just kept going? -They just kept going.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
I guess they like getting their picture taken.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Well, they don't like it. You're like, "Come on."

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
You're like, "Come on. Come on. Picture."

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Well, Murr had a moment tonight that didn't make the cut

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
where we got educated on, well, the Pacific Northwest.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Take a look. [ Laughs ]

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Where are you guys from?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
We live now in Pacific Northwest.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
"Pacific Northwest? What's that?"

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Pacific N-Northwest? What's that?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
-It's near Seattle. -Oh, it's near Seattle.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Sal: "Seattle. What's that?"

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Seattle. What's that?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Between Seattle and Vancouver.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Oh!

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Between Seattle and Vancouver.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
-"Where is that?" -Where is that?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
-Where's that? -Keep talking. Just sit down.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Oh, it's close to Canada.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
That's all the way up north and west.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
-Yeah. -All the way.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
[ Laughter ]  Woman: It's cold.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
You know, is it cold? That's cold air up there?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Daytime, it reach some 70, 75.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
-"Daytime?" -Daytime? What's that?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
[ Laughter ]

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Joe: Just roll over. Roll over like a dog in the grass.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
[ Laughs ]

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Have a nice day.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
[ Laughter ]

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Come on. What am I doing? What am I doing?

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
I love -- I love that the little girl's radar went off.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
She was like, "Mom, we need to get out of here."

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
But she didn't -- But she still just played it off.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Sometimes, man, this show -- I gotta tell ya something.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Sometimes I'm like, "What are we doing?"

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Like, what are you making -- I'm a grown man!

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Respect me! I'm rolling around!

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
We know that's not making the air.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
No! I know. But I can't not do it!

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
'Cause then it's gonna make the air,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
and then I'm gonna lose the episode.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
And I don't even know what's more just hilarious.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
It's either that or you're still wearing the wig.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
I know, 'cause I know what I look like.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
I know what I look like with his hair.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Everything's funnier with you wearing the hair.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
No, not to me, it doesn't!

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
I know. Why aren't you wearing it now?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm kind of upset about that. I miss it.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
It's only one series. We keep it to one series.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Well, Joe ran into someone from his past in this clip

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
that we didn't see in tonight's episode.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Take a look.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Murr: Joe, call the guy with the mustache over to you.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Are you getting good photos here, friend?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
-What lens are you using? -It's a macro lens.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
It extends out all the way like this.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
-Holy cow. Yeah. -Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
-You look so familiar to me. -Yeah?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
"Didn't we chicken-fight

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
at an all-inclusive in St. Thomas?"

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Did we chicken-fight at an all-inclusive in St. Thomas?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
-No. -Different guy.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah, must've been.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
"You weren't on my shoulders in a pool at the adults-only pool?"

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
You weren't on my shoulders in a pool

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
at the adults-only pool in the Riviera Maya?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I've never been in a pool.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
In Saint Mar-- Was it Saint Martin?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
-No. -No, no.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
So familiar. We chicken-fought somewhere.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
-Did we? -"I chicken-fought you!"

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
-I chicken-fought you. -Maybe in the future.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
"Funny story -- That was the trip where I went black,

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
but now I'm back."

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I have a very familiar face. Very bland features.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
You know, I remember that trip well

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
because that's where I went black, but I came back.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Oh, cool, cool.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
[ Laughter ]

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Joe: Great weather today.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Is chicken fighting a universal thing?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Everybody knows what chicken fighting is?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Or is that a regional thing?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I think it's a fairly common thing.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
But my favorite part of it is that Joe listed

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
three different islands

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
that he's chicken-fought other men on.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
I'm the chicken-fight champion of the Caribbean, baby.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Does anybody else chicken-fight?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Did everybody know what chicken-fight is?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
[ Applause ]

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
We got eight people.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
I chicken-fought all of 'em and won.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
And at the end of this episode,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
we're all gonna chicken-fight each other.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
[ Laughter ] In a pool.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
All right, we have a lot more "Impractical Jokers After Party"

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
coming up, including a visit from Victoria Justice.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Do not move, people!

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Let's do it.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
[ Cheers and applause ]

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
â™ªâ™ª

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
[ Cheers and applause ]

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
-It's the "After Party"! -Yes!

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Welcome back to "Impractical Jokers After Party."

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I'm here with Joe, of course, Q and Murr.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
And we're talking about tonight's episode.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
And we actually have the picture

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
that I think, Q, you drew of Joe.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
-Oh, yeah. -Oh.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Yeah, that's the original. That's to scale.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
That is to scale!

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
It looks like Jay Leno's head on I don't know who's body.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
-Arnold Schwarzenegger's body. -Correct me if I'm wrong.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Doesn't he have a Lance Bass thing going on here?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
-Yeah, he does! -He does, right?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Is this the transformation we're gonna be seeing soon?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Uh, yeah. Pretty soon, yeah.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
No. What he's gonna do -- He's gonna tape that

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
on the ceiling of his bedroom, and that'll be enough.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
To just look up and see that

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
and pretend that this Adonis is her man.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
It's weird. Like, you got all muscles,

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
but you still got the double chin.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
I know. I wanted to make sure that some of it was real.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
And, like, a [bleep]-eating grin.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
-The grin is right, yeah. -What were you thinking,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
though, when he actually -- when he came out with no shirt on?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I was like, "I am gonna look like an ass.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
I'm gonna look like an ass."

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I didn't see it coming at all.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Usually you get the hint that something's in the air, maybe.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
This, out of nowhere, out of nowhere.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah. I saw it in your eyes when I was approaching.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
You're like, "Oh, here it comes."

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Yeah. [ Laughs ]

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
We just saw Q's picture, but Q actually got to share

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
his knowledge of  herbs

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
in this clip we didn't see tonight.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Take a look.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Man: You in charge of the herbs?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
-You in charge of the herbs. -"Why, you need some?"

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Why? Do you need some herb? You need some?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
If you need some herb, I can --

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
We got some over there I can get to you.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Talk to my pal Sean over there. He can get some right over here.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Try to convince him how much better this garden would be as condos.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Is this your first time in the botanical gardens?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
What I like to call prime real estate.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
If it was me, whoosh. Condos.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Luxury. Luxury, high-end condos.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
I was thinking, like, "Botanical Estates," you know?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
"Only the right people could afford to move in" type of thing.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Just really nice, high buildings.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Woman: Oh, we're not supposed to? Oh.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Do I look like I care at all about these plants?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
We're not sure.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
I do not care about these plants at all.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Oh, my bosses...

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
"They just started letting me back in here."

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
They just started letting me back in here, the bosses.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
I printed this at home on my printer.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
[ Laughs ]

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
"If you're looking at edibles..."

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
If you're looking for edibles, my boy Sean over there...

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
[ Laughter ]

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
[ Applause ]

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
-How all over the map is that? -That was great.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
-I go from drugs to... -High-end condos.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
...high-end condos to the "right people,"

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
to I'm illegally there, to "Do you want some edibles?" in one conversation.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Do you do any research at all

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
around the place of, like, where you're going, though?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
-It's a great question. No. -None.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
The situation where it became very obvious to me

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
that it was useless trying to learn how to do it

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
was when we worked as dentists.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Like, they go to school for years to learn these things.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm not going to learn in five minutes how to use a scalpel.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I don't know. What do we use?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Scalpel? You're not doing dentistry, right?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
-A drill? -Unless you're cutting gums.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Pliers? I don't know what they use!

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Just stay on TV, buddy. Don't become a dentist.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Which makes me realize that this TV show proves to me yet again

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
that we have no skills whatsoever.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
You know, it's odd to me that you don't know how to be

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
a dentist considering your teeth fall out every other week.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
It's true. My teeth are like my hair.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
[ Laughter ]

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Q gave some unusual directions to a young tourist,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
but what you didn't see is Sal and Q

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
both gave parkgoers similar advice.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Take a look.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Yes, sir?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
The rose garden. I think...

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
"Up your ass, to the left."

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Most likely, it's gonna be up your ass, to the left over here.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
-Okay. -Yeah.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
What do you need, sir? An exit?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
"Up your ass and to the left."

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
It's definitely up your ass to the left.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
[ Laughter ]

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah. I think it's -- I think it's --

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
But I'll find out. I'll find out.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
'Cause all they ever tell me -- "It's up your ass to the left."

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
That's all they ever tell me every time. And I'm like, "Why?"

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
[ Laughter ]

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
That guy -- That guy fought in World War II.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
But it's always funny 'cause, again, you say it with confidence.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
People always just kind of get confused like,

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
"Yeah, maybe there  is up my ass."

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
That joke is a Tenderloin joke

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
that we've been doing for decades.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
-Decades. -Who came up with it?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
If I had to guess, I'd probably say Joe.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
But, you know, the classic way to do it

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
is turn your head on the "ass," 'cause you do that a lot.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
He goes, "It's up your ass, to the left."

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
-That's a cheap way to do it. -Yeah.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
The right way to do it is, "Up your ass, to the left."

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
The ballsy way -- like you said, the Brooklyn --

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
The ballsy way is, "It's up your  ass and to the left."

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
That's it.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Now, they've used that response

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
throughout "Jokers" history, of course.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And we've put together their greatest hits.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
It's just up your ass and to the left.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
-Hey, guys? -Copy.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
I'm over in the food court, uh,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
and this nice lady's asking where the bathroom is.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I'm not quite sure. It's my first day. Where is that?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Roger that. The bathrooms are directly

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
up her ass and to the left.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
[ Laughter ]

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
It's, uh...

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
"Ma'am, the bathroom is up your ass and to the left."

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Woman: Do you know where the museum is at?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
The museum? Yeah, it's up your ass, make a left.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
[ Laughter ]

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
East Broadway?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
It's up your ass, to the left. Yeah. You got it.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Do you know where 100 Center Street is?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Oh, it's up your ass, to the left.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Directly up your ass and to the left!

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
-Okay. -Okay? Take care.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
-Oh, your English no good? -EspaÃ±ol.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Oh.  EspaÃ±ol. Yeah, all right.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
It's up your  culo, to the left.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
-What are you looking for? -Tahini sauce.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
I think that's up your ass, to the left up there.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
I think.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
-Up to the left? -I think so.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I thought he said, "Up your ass, to the left."

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Well, no. She asked for the tahini sauce.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
And that's up your ass, to the left.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
"Up your ass and to the left!"

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
It's just up your ass and to the left.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
It's up your ass and to the left.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Up your ass, to the left.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Is there, like, a bathroom?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
It's up your ass, to the left right here.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I think up your ass and to the left over here.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
"Ass, left. Up ass, left."

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Like, directly up your ass, and then to the left.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Joe: Yeah. Go right up your ass here, and you make a left.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Yeah, up your ass and  then  to the left.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Right up your [bleep] ass. Up here on the left.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Don't take a left first. You'll never find it.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah. Up your ass to the left, right over there.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
It's up your ass, then make a left.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
And that's only the last few seasons.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
The first couple of seasons, we did it all, too.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Are you surprised, though, when people do come up to you --

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
You'll say something in one of the episodes

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
and never think that people are gonna --

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
It was funny, but then it catches on

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
to where people are making T-shirts, doing this, doing that.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Well, I'll tell you.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Expressions on our show catch fire all the time.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Case in point to the garden challenge from this episode --

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
The little kid started running around

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
the garden screaming, "Penis Flytrap."

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Oh, God. Penis Flytrap.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
Well, I mean, Santiago became a thing.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
-Santiago. -Yeah, Santiago.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
We named our tour after it

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
because so many people latched onto it.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I get called "Mustache" --

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Every single day of my life,

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
somebody says to me, "Hey, Mustache."

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
So basically, it's like Larry, Mustache, and Ferret.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
What's Sal? Depressed?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
[ Laughs ] Broken.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Aww. Is that 'cause Sal's not here?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
-Yeah. -Yeah, of course.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
When you're not here, we're gonna make fun of you, too.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
-Do you know where Sal is? -Up your ass, to the left!

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
We have more "Impractical Jokers After Party,"

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I'm Joey Fatone, and I'm here, of course,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
with Joe, Q, and that guy Murr.

-That's me. -That one there.

We're discussing, of course, tonight's episode.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
And joining us, from "Victorious" and "Zoey 101,"

Thank you for coming.

-Who do you owe money to... -Welcome to the lion's den.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
...that you are slumming here with us?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
No. Are you kidding me? I'm so happy to be here.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I'm such a fan of the show and of you guys.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
And this is awesome. I'm kind of fangirling.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Well, last season, the guys

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
gave Victoria a pretty unique shout-out.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Take a look.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Murr: Guys, do you know if Avenue A is this way or this way?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Avenue A's that way.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
So, is that just down two blocks? Yep.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
We actually met. I'm James.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
We met at Victoria Justice's Fangirl Symposium.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
-Uh, no. She's great. -Nope. That was not it.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
I was the guy that kept mansplaining everything to you.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
[ Laughter ]

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
-Hey, Victoria, real quick. -Yeah.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
When did you first start watching the Jokers? When did you become a fan?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Um, when it first started, yeah.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I just stumbled across it on TV, my mom and I.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
And we were like, "This show is really, really funny."

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I'd never seen anything like it, and I started telling my friends

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
about it, and they got really into it.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
And, um, yeah. I just kept, like, spreading the word.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
-I think I tweeted about it. -Yeah.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
And, um, it just, like, always

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
makes me laugh without fail, every time.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It's like the Justice cult following.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
-Yeah! -She shouted it out.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
And you guys have an interesting story, you and Joe, actually.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah. I...

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
My niece told me that she -- You did an interview, actually,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
and my niece flipped out and was like, "Oh, my God.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Uncle Joey, Victoria Justice knows you."

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
I said, "Okay." So I watched the interview.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
And then we found out that you were doing an event

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
at the UGG store in midtown Manhattan.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
So I was like, "Okay. I'm gonna go meet Victoria Justice.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
This should be easy. I'm just gonna go do it."

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
So I called up the UGG store and asked for the manager on duty.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I said, "Who's the manager on duty?" They're like, "Oh, Ashley."

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I said, "Okay," and I hang up, so now I have a name.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
So now I walk.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
And the line is around the block to see Victoria.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
-That's so smart! -The line is wrapped around.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
You don't know this. This is how I got in there.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
The line is wrapped around, like, blocks.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
There's hundreds of people. I cruise right by everybody.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
And I saw -- The doors are locked,

Well, Sal has lost, of course.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
And of course, he had to endure a zombie apocalypse, all right?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Now, this punishment was pretty huge and elaborate.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Who came up with this idea?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
And how did it evolve to what it is?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
This started with a simple idea,

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
which was let's make Sal go into a sewer.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
In front of that, it involved --

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
So, Sal has been through what?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
He's been through haunted corn mazes, mansions.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
But he had never been through a zombie apocalypse.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
And of course we always talk crap about Sal.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
But it's great to see when you always get family members involved.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
So, you had Sal's nieces, both of his nieces.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Did they love it? Did they enjoy it?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000

we had a staging area where, for hours,
