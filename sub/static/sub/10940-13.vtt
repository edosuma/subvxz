No, Lisa, you are interfering
in my life.

00:05.138 --> 00:07.231
Giving out my e-mail address
to some guy I don't even know

00:07.340 --> 00:09.399
because my love life
is just so pathetic.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.534
Who do you think you are?

00:11.644 --> 00:16.581
I don't know that I have ever been
so disappointed in you.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.117
It's Ashley. I swear she calls me
like 10 times a day.

00:19.219 --> 00:19.810
Really?

00:19.919 --> 00:21.511

Oh, poor baby.

you just let me know.

01:49.943 --> 01:50.841

Shh, Mallory!

02:34.687 --> 02:35.585
Sorry.

02:35.688 --> 02:37.918
It's just that he's supersensitive
to noise.

02:42.629 --> 02:44.756
What do you think?
Is he ready for a test-drive?

02:44.864 --> 02:46.593

I don't want to rush it.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.885
Yeah, but they can't just come
on your land without permission.

04:52.992 --> 04:54.186
No, no, they can't.

06:11.237 --> 06:13.398

06:13.506 --> 06:14.404
Lisa tries to set me up

06:14.507 --> 06:16.236
with this, like, friend
of a friend of a friend,

06:16.342 --> 06:18.606
and she gives this virtual stranger
my e-mail address.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.303
Wow, that's not cool.

06:20.413 --> 06:21.402
I know! Thank you.

06:21.514 --> 06:24.176
Anyway, so this guy e-mails me,

06:24.283 --> 06:27.047
and yada, yada, yada, we've
been having these online chats,

06:27.153 --> 06:28.745
and whatever,
it's been kind of nice.

06:28.855 --> 06:29.947

06:30.056 --> 06:31.785

06:31.891 --> 06:34.451
and you're mad at her
because it's been kind of nice?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.755
Okay, no. There are many reasons
I am mad at Lisa.

06:36.863 --> 06:37.955
And that is not the point.

06:38.064 --> 06:42.364
The point is
that this guy wants to meet me.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.060

06:44.170 --> 06:45.762

06:45.872 --> 06:46.736
I don't know.

Like, what if he doesn't live up
to the expectation I have in my head?

06:50.443 --> 06:52.673

06:52.779 --> 06:54.610

he has in his head?

have to see him again, right?

But, you know,
if you don't meet him,

07:19.772 --> 07:21.603
maybe you'll always
sit around wondering

Yes, Ashley spent the night
at my house.

What? Do you think I'm stupid?
'Cause you're treating me like I am.

alone all night, just talking.

08:49.395 --> 08:50.259
Yeah.

08:51.664 --> 08:53.928
I don't even know why
we're talking about this, Caleb.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.092
I mean, there's obviously
nothing between us,

09:42.148 --> 09:45.709
- So, I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

09:50.356 --> 09:53.689
We were just having a conversation.
You didn't have to be so rude.

09:53.859 --> 09:55.827
Rude? How was I rude?

09:55.928 --> 09:57.486
Oh, come on, Mom.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.998
Besides, what kind of a conversation
can you have with him anyway?

10:01.100 --> 10:02.829
Excuse me?

10:02.935 --> 10:05.597
Rodeo's over, sweetie.

He's the only guy
that really gets me, you know?

10:10.810 --> 10:13.438

is probably closer to the truth.

what you're talking about.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.281

than you have, sweetie.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.153

around the block a few times.

10:26.258 --> 10:27.987

Ashley, get back in the car!

10:51.984 --> 10:54.009
[Boom]

10:54.320 --> 10:57.687
This stupid testing
had better end soon.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.623
I mean, what's a meditation retreat
without explosions?

11:00.726 --> 11:02.557
You better hope
they don't find any oil.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.651
It wouldn't matter.

11:03.763 --> 11:06.027
Grandpa would never let them
drill on Heartland.

11:06.132 --> 11:07.690
How long were you
in New York for?

11:07.800 --> 11:08.994
Four years.

11:09.435 --> 11:10.993
Oh, my God.
I got to get you up to speed

11:11.103 --> 11:12.934
on oil companies
and ranchers' rights.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.700
Mallory, I grew up here.

11:14.807 --> 11:17.241
Okay, say they find signs of oil.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.641
Me and you both know that Jack
would never give them permission

11:19.745 --> 11:20.734
to drill on his property.

11:20.846 --> 11:21.813
Exactly.

11:21.914 --> 11:23.848
So, the oil company will apply

11:23.949 --> 11:26.543
to the provincial government board
to get permission,

11:26.652 --> 11:28.176
which they'll most likely get.

11:28.287 --> 11:29.720
But it's our land.

11:29.822 --> 11:30.789
On the surface.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.723
But what's underneath
is usually owned by the Crown.

11:33.826 --> 11:35.123
How do you know all this?

11:35.227 --> 11:36.285
My mom tried to help a neighbor

11:36.462 --> 11:39.590
when he tried to stop an oil company
from drilling on his land.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.223
And did they succeed?

11:41.333 --> 11:43.563
No. Now he has a huge, ugly pump

11:43.669 --> 11:45.796
100 meters away
from his kitchen window.

11:46.739 --> 11:47.831
Picture this.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.430
Them building a pump right there,

11:49.542 --> 11:51.806
and there'd be nothing
you could do about it.

11:51.911 --> 11:54.379
Oh, yes, there is.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.277
Where are you going?

11:56.382 --> 11:59.317
Be back later. And those outhouses
had better be clean.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.643
Nice.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.828
Don't suppose
you could use a roommate?

12:24.844 --> 12:28.177
So, what do you say?

12:29.415 --> 12:31.280
It's not such a good idea, Ash.

12:31.383 --> 12:33.715
Why not?

12:34.420 --> 12:37.412
First off, my place is
about the size of your shoe closet.

12:37.523 --> 12:38.717
It smells like a locker room.

12:38.824 --> 12:40.792
Oh, I don't care about that stuff.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.862
Please. Look, I promise
I won't cramp your style.

12:43.963 --> 12:46.363
And it's just till I can find
a place of my own.

12:46.465 --> 12:48.558
Let me guess. You got
in another fight with your mom.

12:48.667 --> 12:49.998
She's driving me crazy.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.627
I just feel so claustrophobic.

12:53.539 --> 12:56.508
Out here, I feel like I can breathe.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.874
Yeah, well,
don't breathe too deep.

12:59.979 --> 13:02.379
Right. The locker room.

13:02.848 --> 13:05.646
So, does that mean that I can stay?

13:07.620 --> 13:09.281
I guess so.

13:09.388 --> 13:10.980
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you!

13:11.090 --> 13:12.648
But only for a few days.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.922
You got to do something
about your car.

13:16.028 --> 13:17.655
Hide it up the highway
or something.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.230
Are you serious?

13:19.331 --> 13:22.391
Yeah. You can't tell anyone
you're staying here, okay?

13:22.501 --> 13:25.664
Aw, are you worried
you're gonna sully my reputation?

13:25.771 --> 13:29.366
I'm worried you're gonna sully mine.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.181
Thanks.

13:40.286 --> 13:41.344
We can't just sit back

13:41.453 --> 13:44.047
and let Bedford Oil
do whatever they damn well please.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.384
Well, so, what are
we gonna do, then?

13:45.491 --> 13:47.118
We fight back.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.888
We hold a town-hall-style meeting
right here.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.929
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah. Here.

13:52.031 --> 13:54.397
And we invite everyone
in the community, plus our MLA.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.127
You know, if we get
enough people onside,

13:56.235 --> 13:57.896
we could form a citizers coalition.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.335
Let our MLA know
that he'd better listen

14:00.439 --> 14:01.736
if he wants to be re-elected.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.502
I just spent all day

14:03.609 --> 14:05.804
trying to get ahold of someone
at Bedford Oil.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.902
It is an automated maze.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.243
"Press one now.
Press four now."

14:10.349 --> 14:12.340
I think I left a message.

14:12.451 --> 14:14.612
Yeah, they love to make it
unnecessarily complicated.

14:14.720 --> 14:15.880
But, Grandpa, keep trying.

14:15.988 --> 14:17.785
I want one of their people
at my meeting.

14:17.890 --> 14:18.857
What meeting?

14:18.958 --> 14:21.153
You two can come up
with copy for the flyers.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.887
Flyers?

14:22.995 --> 14:24.792
And you are in charge
of communications.

14:24.897 --> 14:26.865
You get a list
from the Hudson Ag Association

14:26.966 --> 14:28.092
and create a mass e-mail.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.794
Write down what you want to say,
then run it by me for approval.

14:30.903 --> 14:32.734
And what's your job?

14:33.939 --> 14:35.463
I delegate.

14:35.574 --> 14:37.565
Look, you should be happy
to be a part of this.

14:37.676 --> 14:39.371
It's democracy at work.

14:39.478 --> 14:41.605
Or a dictatorship.

14:54.493 --> 14:55.926
How long have you been
standing there?

14:56.028 --> 14:58.189
"Wuthering Heights"
has taught me a lot, Amy.

14:58.297 --> 15:00.925
And I think it's stupid to act like
you don't have feelings for someone

15:01.033 --> 15:02.261
when you obviously do.

15:02.368 --> 15:05.064
And isn't it better to talk about it
instead of storing it up?

15:05.170 --> 15:08.196
'Cause if you just store it all up,
you end up miserable and dead

15:08.307 --> 15:10.502
and haunting houses
like Catherine and Heathcliff!

15:10.943 --> 15:11.967
Are you done?

15:12.077 --> 15:13.669
Yes.

15:13.779 --> 15:15.838
Good.

Slept like a log.

16:13.505 --> 16:14.631
Glad to hear it.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.402
Why don't I go into town
and get us some coffee?

16:17.509 --> 16:20.444
Well, believe it or not,
I know how to make coffee.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.339
Even better.

[Cell phone rings]

16:44.136 --> 16:46.229
All right, buddy.

We've got St. Johrs won't
and chamomile

16:49.708 --> 16:51.141

Hi, guys.

17:16.902 --> 17:18.801
Hi, Lou.

17:18.904 --> 17:23.637
Listen, I am so sorry
about that noise yesterday.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.642
I really hope it didn't disturb you.

17:25.743 --> 17:27.439
No. We were fishing all day.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.478
Okay, great.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.309
You guys going out again today?

17:30.416 --> 17:31.383
Yep.

17:31.483 --> 17:35.419
Actually, we were wondering
if we could stay a few more days.

17:35.521 --> 17:39.287
I'll have to check my bookings,
but I'll get back to you ASAP.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.655
Thanks.

17:41.927 --> 17:43.588
Yes!

17:44.730 --> 17:49.258
Mmm, not only can you make coffee,
but you make good coffee.

17:58.677 --> 18:00.440
- Get into the house.
- Why?

You're not here, okay?

You get my messages?

18:14.760 --> 18:17.024
Yes, I did. All 23 of them.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.402
I was just about to take Shorty out.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.528
Maybe you want to come
for a ride together.

Oh, no! I am so sorry!

Oh, I've always been
a grade-A klutz.

- I'm so sorry.
- No. It's okay.

18:53.732 --> 18:56.166
You're kind of just spreading it
around now, actually.

18:56.268 --> 18:58.099
You're right.
I am just making it worse.

18:58.203 --> 18:59.693
Kind of interesting, actually.

It's sort of Jackson Pollocky
or something.

Hey, I can have it dry-cleaned,
if you just take it off.

take my shirt off

Actually, you know what?

19:16.488 --> 19:18.422
What do you say we just pretend
it never happened?

19:18.524 --> 19:21.186
I kind of got this permanent
reminder here, so...

19:21.293 --> 19:22.988
Sorry. Yeah, sorry.

19:25.264 --> 19:27.391
I can't believe Lou
would be like that.

19:27.499 --> 19:28.557
Believe it.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.430
It must be so hard
for you and Jack.

19:30.536 --> 19:34.529
It does not make things easy,
let me tell you.

Hi.

Hey.

Maggie, you mind if I throw a few
of these flyers on the counter?

19:40.412 --> 19:42.607
- By all means.
- Great.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.375
Oh, you can count me in.

Bedford Oil put a bunch of wells
on my land.

Couple of my cows got real sick.

Joe, your cows have been sick
from the day you got them.

19:52.991 --> 19:55.255
And, Lou, no offense,
but do you honestly think

19:55.360 --> 19:57.692
one woman can stop
the oil industry in Alberta?

that you wanted me to talk with.

and miserable and haunting houses.

Yep. Guess there's a first time
for everything.

22:04.923 --> 22:05.582
Okay.

22:05.691 --> 22:07.784
You know the guys that have been
staying at the dude ranch?

they've been fishing every day.

22:10.595 --> 22:11.584
Yes, so?

22:11.730 --> 22:13.721
Well, all their fishing gear
is still in their cabins.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.060
And I found this in their drawer.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.065
Wait a minute.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.931
You went snooping
through their cabins,

22:18.036 --> 22:19.162
plus you took something?

22:19.271 --> 22:20.738
Borrowed it.
I borrowed it.

You're unbelievable.

Look.

23:07.619 --> 23:08.984
I'm serious, okay?
I'm not gonna let you.

23:09.087 --> 23:10.645
Not after what happened
with the cattle rustlers.

23:10.756 --> 23:12.951
Amy, these guys don't have guns.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.492
I don't care. There's other ways
of solving this. Let's go.

Good day of fishing, fellas?

23:46.558 --> 23:49.026

Oh? That's funny.

23:51.863 --> 23:53.524
she saw you working
with an oil crew.

23:54.900 --> 23:59.564
Well, Lou, we find we don't always
get a warm reception

23:59.671 --> 24:01.696
when we say we work
for Bedford Oil.

24:01.807 --> 24:02.899
Now, why would that be

24:03.008 --> 24:05.374
when all you do is cut holes
in people's fences

24:05.477 --> 24:07.945
and trespass on their land
to do your testing?

24:08.046 --> 24:10.640
We never cut any holes
in any fence.

24:10.749 --> 24:12.842
Please, my sister saw you.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.476
Then your sister needs a trip
to the optometrist.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.817
'Cause any holes in your fences
were already there.

24:17.923 --> 24:21.086

who will say the same.

Well, I checked my books,
and it turns out

I can't accommodate you
for those extra days.

24:26.431 --> 24:29.992
In fact,
I can't accommodate you at all.

24:30.101 --> 24:31.864
We're paid up in full
until tomorrow, Lou.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.198
You just can't kick us out.

to discuss those concerns."

to this evening

25:47.913 --> 25:50.279
with a pot of my famous chili.

25:50.382 --> 25:53.044
I already made chili, so...

25:53.151 --> 25:55.711
Well, then, you could put it
in the damn freezer.

There's no room
in the damn freezer.

if you're really going to tackle this,

can I give you some advice?

that a lot of people

26:33.959 --> 26:35.927
have made a lot of money from oil,

26:36.027 --> 26:37.824
whether they've worked
for the big companies

26:37.929 --> 26:40.762
or owned their mineral rights
for their properties.

26:40.865 --> 26:43.459
Okay. So, what are you saying?

26:43.568 --> 26:45.832
Well, the last four months
have been pretty tough for me.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.837
You know, I lost my whole herd.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.134
You'd let them on your property?

26:50.241 --> 26:52.766
Yeah, I sure would.

26:52.877 --> 26:56.313
If they found oil at Big River,
we'd never worry about money again.

26:56.414 --> 26:57.608
We?

26:57.716 --> 26:59.980
I'd make sure that you and Amy
were looked after.

27:00.485 --> 27:03.921
So, it's all about money
for you, huh?

27:04.856 --> 27:06.847
Well, it's not just me, Lou.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.789
What do you think
your Grandpa Jack would do

27:08.893 --> 27:10.884
if he owned the mineral rights
to his property?

27:12.831 --> 27:16.494
Grandpa would never let Big Oil
anywhere near Heartland.

27:16.601 --> 27:17.693
And neither would I.

27:18.403 --> 27:21.031
I admire your conviction.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.538
I know you think I'm a hypocrite.

27:24.075 --> 27:27.875
But there's a little bit of hypocrite
in all of us.

27:29.748 --> 27:33.013
[Cell phone rings]

27:49.234 --> 27:51.202
Whoa.

27:58.376 --> 27:59.536
Amy.

28:02.047 --> 28:03.878
Hi.

28:05.717 --> 28:07.947
Amy.

28:09.587 --> 28:10.884
Don't talk to me, Caleb.

28:10.989 --> 28:13.116
It's not what it looks like.

28:13.224 --> 28:14.316
Amy!

28:19.898 --> 28:22.389
Caleb, I'm so sorry.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.101
Don't be.
It's not your fault.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.068
It's mine.

28:28.306 --> 28:31.764
Now, I see our MLA
has sent a representative.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.070
Thank you for that.

28:33.178 --> 28:36.511
I had also hoped Bedford Oil
would send someone,

28:36.614 --> 28:39.344
but it seems they didn't accept
our invitation.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.316
Oh, hold on there.

28:41.419 --> 28:43.853
I'm here. I'm here.

28:43.955 --> 28:47.322
Hi. P.W. Morris.

28:48.359 --> 28:49.326
Lou.

28:49.494 --> 28:50.893
WOMAN:
They're destroying our land.

28:50.995 --> 28:54.431
No, no, please.
Let's hear what he has to say.

28:54.532 --> 28:56.557
- Please.
- Yeah?

28:56.668 --> 28:57.999
Great.

28:58.103 --> 28:59.832
Hi.

29:01.005 --> 29:03.303
Changed my shirt.

29:07.879 --> 29:10.074
How you all doing tonight?

29:12.617 --> 29:15.279
Oh. I'm getting the cold stare here.

29:15.386 --> 29:17.616
That's okay.
I understand your anger.

29:17.722 --> 29:18.654
I do.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.123
See, I grew up on a farm
just outside of Estevan,

29:21.226 --> 29:23.091
and, well, if a stranger so much

29:23.194 --> 29:24.923
as drove his truck
across one of our fields,

29:25.029 --> 29:27.190
my old man was reaching
for his shotgun.

29:27.298 --> 29:30.392
So, I get it. I do.

29:30.502 --> 29:31.696
Listen, the truth is

29:31.803 --> 29:34.704
the oil industry has
a lot of work to do in the P.R. Area.

29:34.806 --> 29:38.640
And we got to work with you folks.
We got to change.

29:38.743 --> 29:40.836
But I got to tell you,
my company may be small,

29:40.945 --> 29:42.742
but we are recognized
as industry leaders

29:42.847 --> 29:44.337
in environmental friendliness.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.280
We're actively researching
carbon capture

29:46.384 --> 29:48.477
and storage technology,
land reclamation.

29:48.586 --> 29:51.350
We are 110% committed
to finding a nice balance

29:51.456 --> 29:54.892
between environmental protection
and development.

29:54.993 --> 29:57.723
Now, I got to be honest with you.
I'm pretty darn proud of that.

29:58.429 --> 30:00.397
Let's not forget
that on a more practical note,

30:00.498 --> 30:02.466
I mean, last year alone,
over $5 billion

30:02.567 --> 30:04.899
was given back to Albertans
in the form of royalties.

30:05.003 --> 30:08.530
What about compensation to ranchers
when you destroy our land?

30:08.640 --> 30:11.108
First off, Bedford tries
pretty darn hard

30:11.209 --> 30:12.676
not to destroy anything.

30:12.777 --> 30:15.143
But if we do any damage
to your property,

30:15.246 --> 30:16.440
we pay full compensation.

30:16.548 --> 30:17.480
You just give us a call.

30:17.582 --> 30:19.106
If you can get through
to a human being

30:19.217 --> 30:20.241
on your damn phone line.

30:20.351 --> 30:23.047
He's right on that. That's true.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.019
Okay, well, we are working on that.

30:25.123 --> 30:26.488
We are.

30:26.591 --> 30:28.286
Now, look,
we want to move forward

30:28.393 --> 30:31.123
in a fair
and community-minded way here.

30:31.229 --> 30:34.858
And like this lovely lady said,
we do want to work together.

30:34.966 --> 30:37.332
And you can't build a great marriage
on a bad relationship.

30:37.435 --> 30:38.424
It just ain't gonna work.

30:38.536 --> 30:41.027
Don't get me wrong. I'm not asking
you folks to marry me here.

30:41.139 --> 30:42.731
I just...

30:42.841 --> 30:46.004
But I am looking forward
to building that relationship.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.376
Truly.

30:52.383 --> 30:54.180
Thank you for sharing
your point of view.

30:54.285 --> 30:56.253
Well, thanks for having me.

30:56.354 --> 30:59.255
Oh, but I do have to ask.
Do we look naive to you?

30:59.357 --> 31:00.949
Excuse me?

31:01.926 --> 31:05.384
We must look naive if you think
that you can just feed us lines

31:05.496 --> 31:08.693
like "community-minded"
and "environmentally friendly"

31:08.800 --> 31:10.461
and think that that's enough,

31:10.568 --> 31:12.968
that we'll just swallow that happily
and go on home.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.635
You talk about progress.

31:15.740 --> 31:18.766
Is it progress when we find
our water supplies depleted

31:18.877 --> 31:21.539
or worse, contaminated?

31:21.646 --> 31:24.877
Is it progress when entire
communities have to be evacuated

31:24.983 --> 31:27.281
to escape the fumes
from sour gas wells?

31:27.385 --> 31:31.116
Is it progress when we see
our forests and grasslands bulldozed

31:31.222 --> 31:33.053
before our very eyes?

31:33.157 --> 31:36.092
I'm sorry, but progress
does not destroy a community.

31:36.194 --> 31:37.752
It allows it to flourish.

31:39.297 --> 31:42.198
I know how important
the oil industry is

31:42.300 --> 31:46.964
to a lot of people in this province,
in this room.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.904
But we cannot allow ourselves
to be bought.

31:50.108 --> 31:51.234
- WOMAN 1: No.
- WOMAN 2: No way.

31:51.342 --> 31:53.310
Because in this relationship,

31:53.411 --> 31:56.403
Bedford Oil thinks
we're a real cheap date.

31:56.514 --> 31:57.503
But I don't.

31:57.615 --> 31:59.708
I think that we are ready
to make a stand,

31:59.817 --> 32:02.217
and that is what
we are going to do here tonight.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.810
We demand the right

32:03.922 --> 32:06.584
to deny drilling and testing
on our property.

32:06.691 --> 32:09.285
We demand strict
environmental guidelines

32:09.394 --> 32:12.420
and the water rights
for our ranchers and farmers.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.691
And I know this is just a start.

32:14.799 --> 32:16.232
And I'm not so naive as to think

32:16.334 --> 32:18.632
that we can take on
the entire oil industry here.

32:18.736 --> 32:21.000
But I promise you,
if we band together,

32:21.105 --> 32:22.663
we can make a difference

32:22.774 --> 32:26.505
and finally see
some real progress.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.616
You guys would not believe
the number of signatures

32:43.461 --> 32:45.224
I got on this petition last night.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.525
And it looks like we got the ear
of our MLA.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.725
His office just called me
to schedule an appointment.

32:49.834 --> 32:51.301
Well, that's awesome, Lou.

32:52.070 --> 32:55.005
You may have more support
than you bargained for.

32:55.106 --> 32:56.198
What do you mean?

32:56.674 --> 32:58.107
Let's go for a ride.

33:13.124 --> 33:15.285
GUS: You can't do this.
Move your trucks now.

33:15.393 --> 33:16.655
TIM: We're not going anywhere.

33:16.761 --> 33:17.989
GUS:
Move, or I'll have to call the cops.

33:18.096 --> 33:19.028
TIM: Go ahead.

33:19.130 --> 33:21.530
Like I said,
you can't do this.

33:21.632 --> 33:22.621
But we have.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.702
Dad, what is going on here?

33:24.802 --> 33:26.235
Are you responsible for this?

33:26.337 --> 33:28.202
I found out
where these guys were drilling.

33:28.306 --> 33:30.274
We've been following them
since this morning.

33:30.375 --> 33:31.865
- But I thought...
- I know, honey.

33:31.976 --> 33:33.739
What you're doing is illegal.

33:33.845 --> 33:34.971
Yeah, well, I guess you'd know,

33:35.079 --> 33:36.740
being the expert
in law-breaking yourself.

33:36.848 --> 33:37.712
Now, you listen here.

33:37.815 --> 33:39.715
No. No. You listen!

33:40.118 --> 33:42.780
I've had just about enough
of your B.S.

33:42.887 --> 33:44.650
You guys are all the same.

33:44.756 --> 33:46.314
I've seen you come and go
for 30 years,

33:46.424 --> 33:47.652
and it's never any different.

33:47.759 --> 33:50.751
Hi! Hey, there.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.989
Listen, how you doing, folks?

33:53.097 --> 33:55.292
Listen, why don't you guys
go ahead and take the day off?

33:55.400 --> 33:56.594
Okay? Go ahead.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.066
That goes for the rest of you, too.

33:58.169 --> 34:01.297
Go on. Take a day off.

34:01.506 --> 34:03.303
Hey, listen,
you all can go home, too, folks.

34:03.408 --> 34:05.501
There's not gonna be
any more testing here today, okay?

34:05.610 --> 34:07.077
I promise you that.
You got my word.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.715
All right, let's pack it in.

34:12.850 --> 34:15.341
Hey, Lou?
Grab a word real quick?

34:18.755 --> 34:20.781
Yeah.

34:22.427 --> 34:25.658
Listen, I heard that some of my guys
werert totally up front with you.

34:25.763 --> 34:27.754
Up front?
They blatantly lied.

34:28.599 --> 34:31.295
Okay, well,
I'll make it up to you.

34:38.509 --> 34:40.136
Listen, I will let you pay

34:40.244 --> 34:42.303
for the damage
your company made to our fence.

34:42.413 --> 34:45.473
But I'm not a hypocrite,
and I don't accept bribery.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.914
Bribery?

34:47.018 --> 34:49.418
Well, now you're besmirching
my reputation here, Lou.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.987
Oh, but your reputation
is already besmirched.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.393
Okay.

34:58.362 --> 35:00.762
You know, another time,
another place...

35:00.865 --> 35:03.629
Good-bye, Mr. Morris.

35:05.169 --> 35:07.535
All right.

35:07.805 --> 35:09.670
See you around.

35:12.243 --> 35:14.973
Let's go! Come on!

35:21.786 --> 35:23.777
All right, give it to me.

35:23.921 --> 35:26.082
Good boy.

35:26.190 --> 35:29.057
Here you go.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.890
That's a good boy.

35:31.996 --> 35:34.760
Good boy. Nice.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.096
I think he's really getting there.

35:37.201 --> 35:38.725
Yeah, I guess he's ready
to go home.

35:38.903 --> 35:42.339
Yep, I guess so.

35:42.440 --> 35:46.900
Hey, what's wrong?
Have you gotten too attached?

35:47.011 --> 35:50.447
No, it's not him.

35:50.548 --> 35:52.482
It's Caleb.

35:53.117 --> 35:55.881
Did you know that Ashley
was living with him?

35:55.987 --> 35:59.514
Kit might have mentioned it, yeah.

35:59.624 --> 36:01.455
It's just like Acorn, you know?

36:01.559 --> 36:03.754
I thought I was making
great progress,

36:03.861 --> 36:09.197
and then, boom,
everything's gone in an instant.

36:09.300 --> 36:13.964
Well, Acorrs better now.
He got through it.

36:14.372 --> 36:16.897
Yeah.

36:17.408 --> 36:19.672
Hey.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.830
You don't have to go.

36:45.937 --> 36:48.132
Yes, I do.

36:49.273 --> 36:52.071
If it's about me and Amy,
it's over, Ash.

36:53.744 --> 36:56.304
I messed that up beyond repair.

36:56.414 --> 36:58.211
How can you be so sure?

37:00.117 --> 37:03.052
Just stay a few more days
if you want.

37:03.154 --> 37:04.644
You can leave your car there.

37:04.755 --> 37:08.282
It doesn't matter anymore anyway.

37:20.905 --> 37:24.898
I'm just picking up
my empty chili pot.

37:30.715 --> 37:32.273
Lou.

37:34.785 --> 37:36.514
I interfered. I did.

37:36.621 --> 37:41.058
I really just wanted to help you.
And I stepped on your toes.

37:41.158 --> 37:43.251
And you're a perfectly capable
young woman.

37:43.361 --> 37:45.591
And I just... I apologize.

37:47.565 --> 37:51.433
Lisa, it wasrt just that, okay?

37:51.535 --> 37:54.265
You tried to set me up with some guy
you'd never even met before,

37:54.372 --> 37:55.737
like I was totally desperate.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.899
No, no, I'm sorry about that.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.636
I am.

38:00.444 --> 38:01.775
Did he ever get in touch with you?

38:01.879 --> 38:03.676
Yeah, yeah.

38:03.781 --> 38:06.181
He did.
Did you write him back?

38:06.284 --> 38:07.808
Yeah.

38:07.918 --> 38:09.510
Anything happen?

38:11.022 --> 38:15.550
I'm kind of going out
on a date with him.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.288
Well, so, then,
I didn't do too badly.

38:18.396 --> 38:20.455
I guess not.

38:20.564 --> 38:21.861
When is this date?

38:23.000 --> 38:24.900
Oh, my! Is it Tuesday?

38:25.002 --> 38:25.991
Yes.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.832
It's now.

38:27.938 --> 38:30.600
With everything going on,
I completely forgot!

38:30.708 --> 38:32.573
And Ty's got the truck
on a supply run.

38:32.677 --> 38:34.167
- All right.
- And I'm not dressed.

38:34.278 --> 38:36.542
Okay. Well, don't panic.
Just go change. I'll take you.

38:36.647 --> 38:37.409
- Yeah?
- Yes.

38:37.515 --> 38:38.982
You'll be fashionably late.
You'll be fine.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.414
Okay.

38:41.752 --> 38:44.550
Lisa, thanks.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.953
Lou, if it's just wrong,

38:47.058 --> 38:48.525
you call me
and I'll come and get ya.

38:48.626 --> 38:50.890
Okay.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.519
But go get dressed.

38:52.630 --> 38:53.619
Yes.

38:53.731 --> 38:56.222
Hey, Grandpa.

38:59.637 --> 39:01.104
So, I did good, huh?

39:25.162 --> 39:26.595
Peter?

39:34.705 --> 39:35.637
Sam?

39:35.740 --> 39:38.208
You are supposed to be Peter, not...

39:39.510 --> 39:41.808
Let me guess.
Peter William.

39:41.912 --> 39:44.472
- Peter Walter, actually.
- Yeah.

39:44.582 --> 39:46.140
And you're supposed to be Sam.

39:46.250 --> 39:49.083
My full name is Samantha Louise.

39:49.186 --> 39:52.121
I wasrt gonna use my real name.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.350
Why didn't you tell me
you worked for Bedford Oil?

39:54.458 --> 39:56.016
We never talked about work.

39:56.127 --> 40:00.154
And, by the way, I don't actually
technically work for them.

40:00.264 --> 40:01.288
I own Bedford.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.825
You own Bedford Oil?

40:03.934 --> 40:05.492
Yeah.

40:05.603 --> 40:08.504
And I guess that makes me
the big bad wolf, right?

40:08.606 --> 40:10.471
Mmm-hmm.

40:10.574 --> 40:12.303
Wow.

40:13.344 --> 40:14.675
It's crazy.

40:14.779 --> 40:15.905
Yeah.

40:16.013 --> 40:17.742
Crazy.

40:17.848 --> 40:22.512
Why don't I just make this easy
for both of us, hey, and...?

40:22.620 --> 40:25.054
Wait, wait, wait.
You don't have to go.

40:25.156 --> 40:26.953
I mean, we're both here.

40:27.057 --> 40:29.958
Why don't we stay
and have a meal or something?

40:30.060 --> 40:33.257
I... I can't.

40:33.364 --> 40:36.128
I'm sorry.

40:48.746 --> 40:52.273
I just have to say I am so happy
you guys worked things out.

40:52.383 --> 40:53.372
Mallory.

40:53.584 --> 40:54.744
No, no, no.
Don't thank me.

40:54.852 --> 40:57.286
But if you do want to buy me
a little present, I'll happily accept.

40:57.388 --> 40:59.015
- Mallory, it's over between us.
- Nothing big.

40:59.123 --> 41:01.853
A box of chocolate,
a pair of earrings.

41:01.959 --> 41:02.948
What did you just say?

41:03.060 --> 41:05.722
I said it's over between us.
I can't be with a liar.

41:05.830 --> 41:09.789
Okay, Ty might not be perfect,
but he is not a liar.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.231
I'm talking about Caleb, not Ty.

41:13.637 --> 41:15.764
You mean, this whole time...

41:15.873 --> 41:17.704
Oh, my God!
Of course not Caleb!

41:17.808 --> 41:19.036
I've been talking about Ty.

41:19.143 --> 41:21.634
Isn't it obvious, Amy?

41:21.745 --> 41:24.908
Ty is the Heathcliff
to your Catherine.

41:25.015 --> 41:28.473
Now I'm back at square one.

41:38.195 --> 41:40.095
Good night.

41:40.197 --> 41:41.425
Good night.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.304
Thanks again for letting me stay.

41:49.540 --> 41:51.599
If you're cold,
you can come inside.

41:52.776 --> 41:54.209
I wouldn't mind.

42:11.595 --> 42:13.119
Hey.

42:13.764 --> 42:15.891
Hey.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.451
Hey, you're still here.

42:36.554 --> 42:37.953
Yeah.

42:38.088 --> 42:40.215
I'm just waiting for a ride.

42:41.091 --> 42:42.683
Listen, Sam.

42:42.793 --> 42:45.819
Or Samantha Louise.
Or whatever your name is.

42:45.930 --> 42:48.125
Lou. My name is Lou.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.426
Okay. Lou.

42:49.533 --> 42:50.795
Yeah.

42:52.303 --> 42:56.239
Our correspondence,
I enjoyed it very, very much,

42:56.340 --> 43:00.902
and I just kept thinking,
"This is too good to be true, right?

43:01.011 --> 43:04.242
She's gonna show up,
she's gonna look like a trucker."

43:04.348 --> 43:08.375
You're here, and you're beautiful.

43:11.522 --> 43:13.786
I thought you were gonna be
short and hairy.

43:17.928 --> 43:21.159
See, I just... I think
that we have a lot in common.

43:21.265 --> 43:24.996
You know, and one very big thing
not in common.

43:25.669 --> 43:29.605
Look, Peter, you are
a very attractive man, okay?

43:29.707 --> 43:32.005
Very, very attractive.

43:32.109 --> 43:34.407
But this can never work.

43:34.511 --> 43:37.241
I mean, you stand for things
that make my blood boil.

43:37.348 --> 43:39.475
So, that would
keep things interesting, right?

43:39.583 --> 43:42.882
It could never work.

43:53.664 --> 43:56.189
You have to admit,
that was nice, wasrt it?

43:56.300 --> 43:58.632
That is beside the point.

44:00.437 --> 44:01.563
Peter, I can't.

44:01.672 --> 44:03.799
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Okay.

44:03.941 --> 44:05.408
Okay.

44:06.577 --> 44:08.636
Good-bye.

44:08.746 --> 44:11.408
Bye.
