00:02.181 --> 00:03.614
(upbeat march plays)

00:03.682 --> 00:06.447
* Good morning, USA! *

00:06.515 --> 00:10.382
* I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day *

00:10.450 --> 00:13.317
* The sun in the sky has
a smile on his face *

00:13.384 --> 00:17.485
* And he's shining a salute
to the American race *

00:19.552 --> 00:23.049
* O boy, it's swell to say *

00:23.117 --> 00:24.948
* Good... * Good morning, USA *

00:25.016 --> 00:26.581
Aah!

00:33.782 --> 00:35.980
This morning's top story: the economy.

00:36.048 --> 00:37.848
People are losing their jobs, their homes

00:37.916 --> 00:40.283
and their life savings,
and everybody's cutting back.

00:40.351 --> 00:42.850
Even us-- last night we only 68'd.

00:42.918 --> 00:44.718
Really? That's terrible.

00:44.786 --> 00:46.219
Oh, well.

00:46.287 --> 00:49.988
Well, I'm doing my part to
save this family some money.

00:50.056 --> 00:52.489
Look-- I'm rolling my own tampons.

00:55.124 --> 00:57.524
I just saved 21 cents!

00:57.592 --> 01:00.192
That's my girl-- soaking up the savings!

01:00.259 --> 01:03.193
I'll just shove this in my box.

01:03.261 --> 01:04.760
Mom, just put your box on the table.

01:04.828 --> 01:06.495
While we're eating?

01:06.563 --> 01:08.262
Oh, okay.

01:11.231 --> 01:13.365
(Italian accent):
A-good a-morning, everybody.

01:16.002 --> 01:17.235
Eh...

01:17.303 --> 01:18.737
eh...

01:18.804 --> 01:20.271
eh...

01:20.339 --> 01:21.773
eh... eh...

01:21.840 --> 01:24.108
Roger, only one scoop of chocolate mix.

01:24.176 --> 01:25.976
Everyone h to cut back.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.911
<i>(grunts) Why should I have to?!</i>

01:27.979 --> 01:31.180
Stan spends $400 a week in gas for his SUV!

01:32.414 --> 01:34.276
Stan, I can't believe this!

01:34.344 --> 01:38.403
I'm shoving recycled couch
stuffing up my Jk Johnson

01:38.471 --> 01:39.934
while you're burning through cash!

01:40.001 --> 01:43.761
You need to get rid of that SUV
and get a hybrid right away!

01:43.828 --> 01:45.928
As if! I need my SUV!

01:45.996 --> 01:47.963
You never even haul anything!

01:48.030 --> 01:49.063
I'd like the option.

01:49.131 --> 01:50.364
L-Look, just don't understand.

01:50.432 --> 01:51.831
All right? I love that SUV.

01:51.899 --> 01:54.066
I'm a big man-- I need a big car!

01:54.133 --> 01:55.500
It's who I am!

01:55.568 --> 01:57.767
* *

01:57.835 --> 01:59.669
(tires squealing)

02:02.004 --> 02:04.171
(loud crash)

02:04.239 --> 02:06.005
* *

02:09.074 --> 02:11.309
* *

02:11.377 --> 02:14.145
Stan! We lost all our savings in the market!

02:14.212 --> 02:15.845
We're living paycheck-to-paycheck!

02:15.913 --> 02:18.814
Look, I'll find a way to
make some extra money.

02:18.881 --> 02:21.115
Well, you'd better-- because if you don't,

02:21.183 --> 02:24.117
that SUV is O-U-T!

02:24.184 --> 02:26.118
G-O-T I-T?

02:26.185 --> 02:28.085
H-U-H? H-U-H?!

02:28.153 --> 02:29.886
Yes! just stop...

02:29.954 --> 02:31.120
spelling.

02:32.822 --> 02:34.789
Whew, is that rich!

02:34.857 --> 02:36.957
<i>Can't have too much of that.</i>

02:37.025 --> 02:38.791
All right, just birth the ferret baby

02:38.859 --> 02:41.426
and put it in the bucket-
it's worth 50 points.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.528
Oh, Steve! We've been playing Animal Midwife

02:43.596 --> 02:44.929
for two years!

02:44.996 --> 02:47.297
When are you gonna get some new games?

02:47.365 --> 02:49.432
Maybe we should go to your place and play

02:49.500 --> 02:50.866
Let's Watch Your Mom Sober Up

02:50.934 --> 02:52.967
Before She Has to Get to Her Nursing Job!

02:53.035 --> 02:54.401
Ouch!

02:54.469 --> 02:56.503
All I'm saying is, it would be great

02:56.571 --> 02:58.837
if we had some money for some new games.

02:58.905 --> 03:01.206
Hey, you know, I used to do odd jobs

03:01.273 --> 03:02.540
for my neighbor, Mr. Tuttle.

03:02.608 --> 03:04.107
Haven't seen him in a while.

03:04.175 --> 03:06.042
Maybe he'd pay us to do something!

03:06.109 --> 03:07.810
Like pouring ketchup on my head?

03:07.877 --> 03:09.911
Why would he pay you to do that?

03:09.979 --> 03:13.880
Do what you love, and the money will come!

03:13.948 --> 03:16.648
Got to come up with enough
money to save my SUV.

03:16.716 --> 03:17.816
Think, Stan, think!

03:17.883 --> 03:19.184
Hey, I have an idea.

03:19.251 --> 03:21.352
You could put my brain
back into a human body,

03:21.420 --> 03:23.955
and I could get a job and earn
some money for the family.

03:24.023 --> 03:25.590
That's a great idea, Klaus.

03:25.658 --> 03:26.824
(whispers): Stay out of this!

03:26.892 --> 03:28.026
Your father hates your opinions!

03:28.093 --> 03:29.327
I'm just trying to help.

03:29.395 --> 03:31.262
Then tell him you think
it's a terrible idea!

03:31.330 --> 03:33.231
Well, Klaus, we certainly still have

03:33.299 --> 03:35.600
the brain-switching
technology down at the CIA.

03:35.667 --> 03:37.001
You know what?

03:37.069 --> 03:39.870
No. No, no, I-I think we'll
leave you where you are.

03:39.937 --> 03:41.204
It's working well for everybody.

03:41.272 --> 03:42.706
<i>It's not working for me!</i>

03:42.773 --> 03:45.241
Dad... Shut up, Hayley!

03:45.309 --> 03:47.976
Dear Lord, I hope you're
not still mad at us humans

03:48.044 --> 03:49.610
for casting Whoopi Goldberg to play you

03:49.678 --> 03:50.945
in that Muppet TV movie.

03:51.013 --> 03:52.880
I was not part of that decision.

03:52.948 --> 03:56.183
So, Lord, if you could,
help me find a way to keep my SUV.

04:00.989 --> 04:03.556
"Well I'll Be a Son of a Bitch."

04:03.623 --> 04:04.856
What is it, Dad?

04:04.924 --> 04:06.291
It's a horse!

04:06.358 --> 04:08.826
And it's racing today! It's a sign!

04:08.893 --> 04:10.861
Aah! I got to go bet on this horse!

04:10.928 --> 04:12.796
I got to save my SUV!

04:14.532 --> 04:16.332
You know what? Don't.

04:16.399 --> 04:19.233
You've done enough.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.469
(to himself): Don't let her
see that you're suffocating.

04:21.536 --> 04:24.038
(pants) Don't give her the satisfaction.

04:24.106 --> 04:26.140
(panting, wheezing)

04:26.208 --> 04:29.009
(wheezing, labored breathing)

04:37.184 --> 04:38.451
(door creaks)

04:38.518 --> 04:40.352
Mr. Tuttle?

04:42.021 --> 04:44.522
Man, this place is creepy.

04:44.590 --> 04:47.190
I'm getting scaredy farts.

04:47.258 --> 04:48.658
(passes gas)

04:48.726 --> 04:51.293
Calm down, Barry.

04:51.361 --> 04:52.761
Nice guy.

04:52.829 --> 04:54.696
Always smiling.

04:54.764 --> 04:57.666
I've hardly seen him since his wife died.

04:57.733 --> 04:59.533
(calling): Mr. Tuttle?

05:03.837 --> 05:05.638
(Barry passes gas)

05:11.978 --> 05:14.277
(door creaks)

05:14.345 --> 05:16.078
Mr. Tuttle!

05:16.146 --> 05:17.546
TUTTLE: Company!

05:17.613 --> 05:19.947
You've... you've put on a little weight!

05:20.015 --> 05:23.182
It's mostly fat.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.617
WOMAN (over P.A.): It is now post time.

05:25.685 --> 05:27.751
(crowd cheering, hoofbeats)

05:29.554 --> 05:31.054
STAN: There he is.

05:31.122 --> 05:34.360
Man, Well I'll Be a Son of a
Bitch is a good-looking horse!

05:34.428 --> 05:36.498
I've got a really good feeling about this.

05:36.566 --> 05:38.335
ANNOUNCER: And coming down the stretch,

05:38.403 --> 05:41.008
it's... Well I'll Be a Son of a Bitch

05:41.076 --> 05:42.478
finishing dead last!

05:42.546 --> 05:44.847
That was only misleading if
you're just joining us now!

05:44.915 --> 05:47.116
If you watched the race,
it was perfectly clear!

05:47.184 --> 05:49.952
Sorry, I only have one
emotional level to my voice!

05:50.020 --> 05:52.488
(frustrated grunt) I am
gonna go spit on the jockey!

05:52.555 --> 05:54.656
Hey, little man.

05:54.690 --> 05:55.723
(hawks)

05:55.791 --> 05:57.091
Hello.

05:57.159 --> 05:59.092
Roger? You're a jockey?

05:59.160 --> 06:00.693
Mm-hmm, yes, I am a jockey.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.229
Davy Jones from the Monkees
started out as a jockey,

06:03.296 --> 06:05.664
but I don't see how that's
any of your business.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.932
Hey, my racing form! This is yours?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.567
Why the hell'd you circle your horse?

06:09.635 --> 06:10.901
It's a total loser!

06:10.969 --> 06:12.736
Oh, I was doing dangerous drugs last night,

06:12.804 --> 06:15.305
and I got worried I'd forget
which horse I was racing.

06:15.373 --> 06:16.806
I know, I have a problem.

06:16.874 --> 06:18.107
I worry too much.

06:18.175 --> 06:20.209
Damn it, Roger, that horse was my last hope

06:20.277 --> 06:21.710
to save my SUV!

06:21.778 --> 06:23.578
Another very bad race, Clancy.

06:23.646 --> 06:24.913
(quietly): I'm Clancy.

06:24.981 --> 06:27.382
Sorry, Mr. McCormack,
we'll do better next week.

06:27.450 --> 06:30.686
Unfortunately, there isn't
going to be a next week.

06:30.754 --> 06:31.987
Mr. McCormack, no!

06:32.055 --> 06:33.288
Eh, sorry, Clancy.

06:33.356 --> 06:35.925
The only way I can recoup
my losses on this horse

06:35.992 --> 06:38.961
is to shoot it in the face and
collect the life insurance

06:39.029 --> 06:40.997
I took out when I married it. (cocks gun)

06:41.064 --> 06:43.800
I'll buy him! You n've $50,000.

06:43.868 --> 06:45.769
And you don't have BeyoncÃƒÂ© tickets.

06:45.837 --> 06:47.604
Do you? Of course not.

06:47.672 --> 06:48.639
Aw.

06:50.008 --> 06:52.109
Stan, you have to buy this horse.

06:52.177 --> 06:53.542
It's a guaranteed winner.

06:53.610 --> 06:55.441
What?! That horse is a joke!

06:55.508 --> 06:58.339
(quietly): Look, I've been holding it
back with tranquilizers so it loses

06:58.407 --> 07:00.041
and the odds go way up.

07:00.108 --> 07:01.642
Then at next week's Langley Derby,

07:01.710 --> 07:03.677
I'll let it run to its full potential,

07:03.745 --> 07:05.078
and we'll make a fortune!

07:05.146 --> 07:07.847
Wow. That's a really good idea, Roger.

07:07.915 --> 07:09.515
So you'll buy the horse, then?

07:09.583 --> 07:11.250
I don't know. I'd have to take out

07:11.317 --> 07:12.751
a second mortgage for the money,

07:12.819 --> 07:14.419
and if he doesn't win, I'd lose everything.

07:14.487 --> 07:15.720
Are you sure about this?

07:15.788 --> 07:17.588
I'm positive-- this horse is the only thing

07:17.656 --> 07:20.023
that's gonna keep you from
ending up in a car like that.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.491
It's so efficient.

07:21.559 --> 07:23.893
And the radio only gets NPR!

07:23.961 --> 07:25.061
We're nerds!

07:25.128 --> 07:26.362
Get us!

07:26.430 --> 07:28.330
(blows landing)

07:28.398 --> 07:29.631
(shivers)

07:29.700 --> 07:32.300
All right, I'm in-
but do not tell Francine.

07:32.367 --> 07:34.702
It'll be our little secret-
like when you passed out

07:34.769 --> 07:36.870
last Christmas Eve, and I made out with you.

07:36.938 --> 07:37.871
What? Hmm?

07:42.876 --> 07:45.878
Roger, I told you, everyone has to cut back.

07:45.945 --> 07:47.946
Only one thin layer of cream cheese.

07:48.014 --> 07:50.148
Stan spent your life savings on a horse.

07:50.215 --> 07:51.382
What?!

07:51.450 --> 07:52.683
I, uh...

07:52.751 --> 07:54.084
ROGER: What am I doing?

07:54.152 --> 07:56.486
I can't eat a bagel right now-
it's Passover.

07:58.723 --> 08:01.458
(singing song in Hebrew)

08:04.328 --> 08:05.662
(sings in Hebrew)

08:09.925 --> 08:11.559
Ha! Record time!

08:11.627 --> 08:13.427
We're gonna get through this, baby.

08:13.495 --> 08:15.896
I'm gonna take you to Make Out Point

08:14.963 --> 08:16.497
and tongue your gas hole.

08:16.565 --> 08:17.798
Stan! Ooh!

08:17.866 --> 08:20.501
Do you realize we could lose this house?

08:20.568 --> 08:23.769
Do you realize how much
danger you put this family in

08:23.837 --> 08:25.537
to save this stupid thing?!

08:25.605 --> 08:28.240
Look, this horse is gonna
put us back on top.

08:28.307 --> 08:30.074
I'll be able to afford my SUV,

08:30.142 --> 08:32.909
and you'll be able to watch
me drive around the block

08:32.977 --> 08:35.412
(like game show announcer):
from your brand-new lawn chair!

08:35.479 --> 08:36.946
Yay, I won!

08:38.780 --> 08:40.780
Was that a horse?

08:40.849 --> 08:43.249
You'd better be right
about this horse, Stan,

08:43.317 --> 08:45.350
or we're screwed.

08:48.454 --> 08:51.155
See? I told you this thing was fast.

08:51.222 --> 08:54.024
(punching) Hey! I didn't
get to do that earlier.

08:54.091 --> 08:55.725
Stop telling Francine on me! Ow!

08:55.793 --> 08:57.593
Geez, that really hurts.

08:57.660 --> 08:59.361
You broke me. I'm broken.

08:59.429 --> 09:01.396
You're gonna have to do the horse chores,

09:01.464 --> 09:02.633
'cause I'm broken.

09:02.701 --> 09:04.070
Fine! What do I have to do?

09:04.137 --> 09:06.375
Well, you have to brush
the horse's coat and mane,

09:06.443 --> 09:08.945
water and feed it,
and then give it a full relief.

09:09.013 --> 09:12.015
A what? You know-
give it a happy photo finish.

09:12.082 --> 09:14.383
Huh? Take the glue out of the factory.

09:14.451 --> 09:16.619
Spank his front butt. Grant him a bone loan.

09:16.687 --> 09:17.887
Oh!

09:17.955 --> 09:19.856
Uh, oh, no, you're kidding!

09:19.923 --> 09:21.257
No, sir, I am not.

09:21.325 --> 09:23.126
I am stabling a champion racehorse.

09:23.193 --> 09:25.328
A full release ensures a rejuvenative rest

09:25.396 --> 09:26.996
and promotes a winning attitude.

09:27.064 --> 09:29.032
Stan, if you want to keep your SUV,

09:29.100 --> 09:31.168
your house and your wife, you'll do it.

09:31.235 --> 09:33.003
(sighs): I don't know how I'm gonna get

09:33.071 --> 09:35.305
my nightgown on tonight.

09:37.842 --> 09:39.610
So...

09:39.677 --> 09:40.811
Hi.

09:40.878 --> 09:42.179
How's it going?

09:46.218 --> 09:47.819
Here we go. (sighs)

09:47.886 --> 09:49.254
Just, uh...

09:49.321 --> 09:52.291
do me a favor and let me
know when you're about to...

09:52.358 --> 09:53.526
you know.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.530
(gasping, gagging)

09:59.433 --> 10:01.797
Hey, Stan, can you tuck me in and...

10:01.865 --> 10:03.265
Oh, my God, you didn't.

10:03.333 --> 10:04.598
You did!

10:04.665 --> 10:06.131
You told me to!

10:06.199 --> 10:09.666
Well, I-I was just messing with
you for punching me in the arm!

10:09.734 --> 10:11.801
But I can't believe you did it!

10:11.869 --> 10:14.836
Oh-ho! Too good, too good!

10:14.904 --> 10:15.837
Oh!

10:15.905 --> 10:18.006
Well, good night.

10:20.741 --> 10:23.442
Well, Mr. Tuttle, we're done.

10:23.510 --> 10:26.111
You boys have done a fantastic job!

10:26.178 --> 10:27.811
You've earned your hundred bucks.

10:27.879 --> 10:29.213
(all cheer)

10:29.281 --> 10:30.714
I have cash in my wallet.

10:30.782 --> 10:32.082
Great! Where is it.

10:32.149 --> 10:33.349
It's in my back pocket--

10:33.417 --> 10:34.650
grab it for me, won't you?

10:34.718 --> 10:35.751
(all gasp)

10:35.818 --> 10:36.919
Not it!

10:37.920 --> 10:39.554
Not it.

10:39.622 --> 10:41.855
I want this.

10:41.923 --> 10:43.290
(neighing)

10:43.357 --> 10:44.724
What's going on?

10:44.792 --> 10:46.492
He's been acting this way all morning.

10:46.559 --> 10:47.559
He's spooked.

10:47.627 --> 10:48.661
(neighing continues)

10:48.728 --> 10:50.195
Why is the animal

10:50.263 --> 10:52.797
that our future depends on doing that?

10:52.865 --> 10:54.632
Oh, he's fine-- he was expecting

10:54.700 --> 10:57.634
some sunglasses in the
mail that didn't come.

10:57.702 --> 11:00.204
(pained grunt) You'd better
know what you're doing,

11:00.271 --> 11:02.971
you dumb Irish bastard!

11:05.007 --> 11:06.874
We've got to get this thing unspooked.

11:06.941 --> 11:08.808
Everything depends on this horse.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.379
Luckily, I know a guy who
might be able to help us.

11:11.446 --> 11:13.484
Let's just pray that for once,
when we get there,

11:13.551 --> 11:14.751
he doesn't turn out to be me.

11:17.354 --> 11:19.055
Aw, crap.

11:19.123 --> 11:20.257
Can I help you?

11:22.057 --> 11:24.792
I had an appointment
with the horse whisperer.

11:26.095 --> 11:28.230
Oh, yes, he'll be right with you.

11:28.298 --> 11:30.132
Thank God I'm just his secretary.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.000
I'm an associate.

11:34.302 --> 11:36.336
All right, Snot, we'll jimmy him up,

11:36.404 --> 11:37.871
then you go in for the wallet.

11:37.939 --> 11:39.440
Got it.

11:39.507 --> 11:41.241
(all grunting)

11:41.309 --> 11:43.076
(wood creaking)

11:43.144 --> 11:45.611
I'll be like Indiana Jones.

11:45.679 --> 11:47.678
You know, when the stone door was closing,

11:47.746 --> 11:49.913
and then at the last second,
he grabbed his whip and...

11:50.981 --> 11:52.649
(muffled yell)

11:52.716 --> 11:54.450
(all grunting)

11:56.586 --> 11:58.586
Snot's gonna die! (squeaking fart)

11:58.654 --> 12:01.188
I'm getting scaredy farts, huh?

12:01.256 --> 12:03.856
Don't you start,
'cause you're gonna get me going.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.025
(muffled scream of pain)

12:07.861 --> 12:09.728
(whispering)

12:09.796 --> 12:11.797
...imagine... visualize...

12:11.865 --> 12:14.568
(whispering): Horse whispering-
does this stuff really work?

12:14.635 --> 12:16.135
Stan, stop whispering.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.968
The horse won't know who to listen to.

12:18.036 --> 12:19.069
(whispering)

12:20.971 --> 12:21.938
(gasps)

12:22.006 --> 12:23.039
What is it?

12:23.107 --> 12:25.007
This horse says you molested him.

12:27.611 --> 12:30.179
You sick (bleep).

12:30.247 --> 12:32.248
Although it's in peak physical shape,

12:32.316 --> 12:34.150
its mind is shot.

12:34.218 --> 12:36.086
I'm afraid this horse will never race again.

12:36.153 --> 12:38.355
That's it, we're ruined.

12:38.422 --> 12:40.524
Do not say a word of this to Francine.

12:40.592 --> 12:41.692
Do you understand me?

12:41.760 --> 12:43.227
Stan, this is my fault, too.

12:43.295 --> 12:45.563
We got into this together,
we'll get out of it together.

12:49.535 --> 12:51.870
The horse is ruined. Stan raped it.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.705
You're probably going to lose the house.

12:53.773 --> 12:58.577
Damn it, Stan, we're gonna
lose everything because of you!

12:58.645 --> 13:00.846
Francine, wait!

13:00.914 --> 13:02.547
What have I done?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.381
There's no way I'll come up with the money.

13:04.449 --> 13:06.081
My offer still stands.

13:06.148 --> 13:08.047
Put my brain back into a human body,

13:08.115 --> 13:09.847
and I'll get a job doing animal sounds.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.114
Listen to this one.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.846
Yup-yup, yup-yup.

13:12.914 --> 13:14.146
I'm a rabbit.

13:14.214 --> 13:15.914
That's it! Thank you, Klaus!

13:15.982 --> 13:16.915
(kissing)

13:16.983 --> 13:18.583
What a great idea.

13:18.651 --> 13:21.085
Come on, Roger, we're going to the CIA.

13:22.554 --> 13:23.620
(glass breaking)

13:23.688 --> 13:25.288
Wait, wait, where are you going?

13:25.356 --> 13:26.389
We had a deal!

13:28.925 --> 13:31.259
I sure hope this works.

13:31.327 --> 13:33.827
STAN: You heard what the
horse whisperer said.

13:33.895 --> 13:35.595
Its mind is shot, but its body is perfect.

13:37.865 --> 13:40.800
<i>But now with my mind in its body,</i>

13:40.868 --> 13:42.469
I'm gonna win that race.

13:42.536 --> 13:44.203
Wait, aren't we forgetting something?

13:44.271 --> 13:45.371
Oh, yeah.

13:45.439 --> 13:46.572
(whistles)

13:46.639 --> 13:48.540
(neighing, snorting)

13:54.014 --> 13:55.314
Look at you.

13:55.381 --> 13:56.781
You're like Bambi.

13:56.849 --> 13:58.049
Frickin' adorable.

13:58.117 --> 13:59.917
Careful. One hoof at a time.

13:59.985 --> 14:01.484
Good. You're doing it.

14:01.552 --> 14:03.552
(laughing): Look at me. I'm trotting.

14:03.619 --> 14:05.486
Ooh, fancy.

14:05.554 --> 14:07.857
Hey, check out what else I can do.

14:07.925 --> 14:09.092
(groans)

14:09.160 --> 14:10.662
Stop telling Francine on me.

14:10.730 --> 14:11.697
(sighs)

14:11.765 --> 14:13.901
You get one of those.

14:13.969 --> 14:16.573
<i>You get one of those, Horse Stan.</i>

14:16.641 --> 14:18.009
Now we train.

14:19.211 --> 14:20.511
(neighing)

14:22.000 --> 14:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:46.934 --> 14:47.766
(snapping)

14:49.702 --> 14:52.203
Oh, boy.

14:57.473 --> 14:58.740
(bird chirping)

14:58.808 --> 15:00.675
Man, I'm fast.

15:00.743 --> 15:03.545
I think we can actually win this thing.

15:03.613 --> 15:05.447
Can I pet your horse?

15:05.515 --> 15:07.349
Oh, a little cowboy.

15:07.417 --> 15:08.653
Sure, go ahead, buckaroo.

15:10.961 --> 15:12.261
Honey, don't do that.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.695
Horses don't like to be poked in the eye.

15:14.763 --> 15:18.365
Honey, he doesn't like that.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.734
If you don't stop doing that,
I'm going to come to your house

15:20.801 --> 15:22.168
and kick your mom to death while you watch.

15:32.178 --> 15:33.544
Stop that. Stop.

15:36.482 --> 15:38.883
Hey, Frannie, want to come
cheer me on at the track?

15:38.951 --> 15:40.584
It's gonna be exciting.

15:40.652 --> 15:41.986
Fine.

15:42.053 --> 15:44.455
Might as well be there in
person when I lose everything.

15:44.523 --> 15:46.558
Oh, you're a lot of fun. Glad I invited you.

15:46.625 --> 15:48.359
I got to go poop and puke

15:48.427 --> 15:49.828
so I can fit in my jockey pants.

15:53.199 --> 15:54.967
Stupid horse.

15:55.035 --> 15:57.302
Oh, I'm sorry, fella.

15:57.370 --> 15:59.036
It's not your fault.

15:59.104 --> 16:00.704
It's my husband.

16:00.772 --> 16:04.007
What kind of man puts a
car before his family?

16:04.074 --> 16:07.677
Oh, I'll never be able to look
at him the same way again.

16:12.083 --> 16:13.483
Aah!

16:16.653 --> 16:18.754
Boy, it's a good thing I don't have testes,

16:18.822 --> 16:21.657
because there is zero
room left in these pants.

16:21.724 --> 16:23.691
Go ahead, try to stick your pinky in there.

16:23.759 --> 16:24.792
Can't be done.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.960
Nope? Not interested?

16:27.027 --> 16:29.328
You are in a rough mood.

16:29.396 --> 16:30.362
(engine starts)

16:35.236 --> 16:38.004
Hey, brother, chewing on hay?

16:38.072 --> 16:39.139
Yeah? That's cool.

16:39.206 --> 16:40.807
So just checking in.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.543
Seeing when you're going to
put my brain back in a body.

16:43.611 --> 16:44.744
(neighing, snorting)

16:44.812 --> 16:46.213
Oh, no.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.281
Dad, I need your help!

16:48.349 --> 16:50.616
Snot's trapped under Tuttle's fat ass!

16:50.684 --> 16:51.851
That's not your father.

16:51.919 --> 16:53.185
What do you talking about?

16:53.253 --> 16:54.819
Instead of switching my brain with a human,

16:54.887 --> 16:56.620
he switched his own brain with a horse.

16:56.688 --> 16:58.122
That's perfect.

16:58.189 --> 16:59.223
Come on, Dad Horse.

16:59.290 --> 17:03.727
It's not perfect for me, Steve!

17:05.931 --> 17:07.830
Let's go, Dad Horse.

17:07.898 --> 17:08.898
Pull!

17:08.967 --> 17:09.933
(neighing)

17:10.001 --> 17:11.568
It's working!

17:12.303 --> 17:13.403
(grunting)

17:13.470 --> 17:14.337
(gasps)

17:16.773 --> 17:18.141
There's no wallet.

17:18.209 --> 17:19.977
What's going on here?

17:20.045 --> 17:24.683
Well, boys, the truth is,
I don't have a wallet.

17:24.750 --> 17:28.319
Two Christmases ago, I soaked
it in teriyaki sauce and ate it.

17:28.387 --> 17:29.520
(gasping) Why, Mr. Tuttle?

17:29.588 --> 17:31.521
Why did you put us through this?

17:31.589 --> 17:34.490
It was just nice having you boys around.

17:34.558 --> 17:37.459
I don't socialize much
since the missus died.

17:37.527 --> 17:38.860
Here, here's your money.

17:39.995 --> 17:41.928
Let's get out of here.

17:41.996 --> 17:43.630
Fat people disgust me.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.168
Hang on.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.470
I have an idea.

17:53.372 --> 17:54.572
(snorting)

17:54.640 --> 17:57.107
Hey, this is great!

17:57.175 --> 17:59.375
I'm part of the neighborhood again.

17:59.443 --> 18:02.011
Hey, Greg, Terry, how you been?

18:03.246 --> 18:05.781
It's me, Al Tuttle.

18:05.849 --> 18:07.349
He looks terrible.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.117
Why are we always holding hands?

18:09.185 --> 18:11.452
How else will people know we're gay? Oh,
yeah, you're right.

18:16.457 --> 18:18.825
Okay, I bet all your money on you to win.

18:18.893 --> 18:20.059
Come on, it's time.

18:20.127 --> 18:21.861
What the hell is wrong with you?

18:24.597 --> 18:26.365
I can't concentrate.

18:26.432 --> 18:27.432
It's Francine.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.134
What? So she's pissed.

18:29.202 --> 18:31.404
Everybody's pissed.
It's weird times these days.

18:31.471 --> 18:34.839
Oh, she's not just pissed,
she's disappointed, and that's worse.

18:34.907 --> 18:37.008
I can't believe I let her down.

18:37.076 --> 18:38.743
I got to make this right.

18:38.810 --> 18:40.010
Stan, Stan, Stan!

18:40.078 --> 18:41.645
Stan!!

18:41.713 --> 18:43.113
(panicked shouting)

18:45.049 --> 18:47.183
Ahh! Make it quick, just kill me!

18:47.250 --> 18:49.017
No, Francine, it's me.

18:49.085 --> 18:50.852
(gasps)

18:50.919 --> 18:53.154
Stan? You're a horse.

18:53.221 --> 18:56.556
I'm not just a horse, I'm a horse's ass.

18:56.624 --> 18:58.958
I put our family's security in jeopardy.

18:59.026 --> 19:00.726
I just wanted to keep my SUV

19:00.794 --> 19:02.795
so I could roll right over anyone in my way.

19:02.863 --> 19:04.296
But I rolled right over you.

19:04.364 --> 19:05.761
I'm so sorry.

19:05.829 --> 19:07.695
How can I ever make it up to you?

19:09.664 --> 19:12.967
Well, there is one thing
you could do for me.

19:13.034 --> 19:14.035
What?

19:14.103 --> 19:15.270
Come here.

19:15.338 --> 19:17.505
Win.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.573
(whispers): Win.

19:19.641 --> 19:21.742
Well, what are we waiting for?

19:21.810 --> 19:23.076
(neighing)

19:26.580 --> 19:27.580
Ready, Roger? (listlessly): Yeah.

19:27.648 --> 19:29.582
What's wrong, bud?

19:29.650 --> 19:32.618
Wish I had like a rival jockey or
something to make things more exciting.

19:32.685 --> 19:34.219
Hey, it's not too late.

19:34.286 --> 19:35.686
Yeah, I guess you're right.

19:35.754 --> 19:37.354
Hey, you, with the goatee--

19:37.422 --> 19:38.589
Yeah?

19:38.656 --> 19:41.092
I'm so tired. I was up all night.

19:41.159 --> 19:42.760
Oh, yeah? What were you doing?

19:42.827 --> 19:44.061
Pumping your wife.

19:44.129 --> 19:46.129
Hey, no, you weren't.

19:46.196 --> 19:48.063
Yes, I was. Pumping her good.

19:48.131 --> 19:49.697
I'm gonna get you for that.

19:49.765 --> 19:52.533
Bring it on! It is on!

19:52.601 --> 19:53.800
(bell rings) ANNOUNCER: And they're off.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.620
Come on, Stan, come on!

20:13.688 --> 20:15.022
I'm giving it all I got.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.091
Damn it. If only I was a little bit lighter.

20:20.194 --> 20:21.760
(retching)

20:23.697 --> 20:25.231
(retching)

20:26.433 --> 20:27.733
(vomiting)

20:29.636 --> 20:32.437
Whoo-hoo! Son of a bitch!

20:35.208 --> 20:37.941
Can't we just go back to the CIA?

20:38.008 --> 20:39.341
In a minute.

20:39.409 --> 20:41.342
There's something important
I have to do first.

Mr. Spielberg, I have a talking horse,

20:53.517 --> 20:55.718
and I think we both know what that means.

20:55.785 --> 20:59.654
It's time to ride our
talking horses together.

21:00.656 --> 21:04.727
Steven... he's right.
