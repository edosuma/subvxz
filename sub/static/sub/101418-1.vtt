00:24.625 --> 00:25.625
Hurry up BoBoiBoy!

00:26.208 --> 00:27.250
Shh! Keep it down will ya?

00:36.583 --> 00:37.416
Swap the eggs quick!

00:37.958 --> 00:38.541
I'm starving!

00:55.458 --> 00:56.083
Hurry! Hurry!

00:58.708 --> 00:59.208
Huh?

01:11.833 --> 01:12.500
Ok! Job’s done!

01:13.500 --> 01:14.000
Let's move!

01:20.458 --> 01:21.458
Out of my way, BoBoiBoy!

01:22.041 --> 01:23.166
Watch where you’re going.

01:24.208 --> 01:25.500
Huh? What’s that you’ve got there?

01:26.333 --> 01:27.583
What else? It's my breakfast!

01:30.500 --> 01:33.041
Huh?! You're not supposed to
take one of the eggs Gopal!

01:33.166 --> 01:33.666
Why not?

01:34.250 --> 01:35.875
Let’s make an omelet. Want some?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.500
Sheesh... What is wrong with you?

01:38.500 --> 01:39.375
Put it back Gopal! Now!

01:40.416 --> 01:42.791
Hey! Lay off! You're not getting
a single bite of it then!

01:44.416 --> 01:44.916
Huh?

01:57.708 --> 01:59.333
Mama's not home! She’s gone to work!

02:14.833 --> 02:16.250
This is all your fault, Gopal!

02:19.041 --> 02:20.208
My fault? I was just hungry!

02:22.500 --> 02:23.625
You're so full of excuses!

02:34.083 --> 02:35.333
I don't wanna die BoBoiBoy!

02:36.541 --> 02:37.291
Elemental Power!

02:38.875 --> 02:39.583
BoBoiBoy Ice!

02:41.666 --> 02:42.166
Ice Slide!

02:52.500 --> 02:53.250
Amma! Appa! Help!

02:59.916 --> 03:00.916
Well done, BoBoiBoy...

03:01.541 --> 03:03.125
You do all the heavy lifting for me...

03:04.500 --> 03:06.333
and we'll gladly swoop
in to grab the prize!

03:07.541 --> 03:08.916
Let's go, Probe! Transform now!

03:10.750 --> 03:11.708
Aye aye, Mister Boss!

03:11.958 --> 03:12.958
Mode: Probey Copta!

03:17.958 --> 03:18.625
We've lost her!

03:20.125 --> 03:20.958
Look out, BoBoiBoy!

03:31.416 --> 03:32.416
Pizza Transformation!

03:56.708 --> 03:57.833
She’s looking for us.

04:06.583 --> 04:07.625
Please don't find me...

04:07.708 --> 04:08.708
Please don't find me...

04:08.791 --> 04:09.291
-Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:13.458 --> 04:14.541
-Ow! Stop pecking me!
-Hey!

04:15.125 --> 04:16.333
Don't go out there, Gopal!

04:23.625 --> 04:24.458
How was work, Mama?

04:26.083 --> 04:26.791
Calm down, Mama!

04:29.916 --> 04:30.916
Gopal! Get back inside!

04:31.916 --> 04:32.458
Help!

04:34.541 --> 04:35.041
Help me!

04:39.833 --> 04:41.000
We got him, Probe! Let's go!

04:41.916 --> 04:42.750
Okay, Mister Boss!

04:47.625 --> 04:48.708
What are you waiting for?

04:48.875 --> 04:50.083
Help me out here, BoBoiBoy!

04:51.708 --> 04:52.833
You guys go help out Gopal!

04:53.208 --> 04:54.000
I'll go save EggaBot.

04:54.125 --> 04:55.250
BoBoiBoy Thunderstorm!

05:05.541 --> 05:06.250
Gravity Lift!

05:26.541 --> 05:27.958
-Let go of me!
-Be quiet, will you?

05:30.583 --> 05:31.875
Mister Boss! We're almost there!

05:34.875 --> 05:35.791
Farewell, BoBoiBoy!

05:37.208 --> 05:38.541
See you never again, ex-buddy!

05:44.125 --> 05:45.458
Hit the brakes, Probe! Now!

05:52.083 --> 05:52.583
Huh? MYS Justice?

05:56.666 --> 05:58.416
You may be able to run and
escape from your ex...

06:00.708 --> 06:01.208
However!

06:01.875 --> 06:03.041
You cannot escape from Justice!

06:05.500 --> 06:06.000
Ochobot!

06:06.500 --> 06:07.000
Okay!

06:14.250 --> 06:14.750
Huh?

06:15.125 --> 06:16.500
What are you trying to do? Open a zoo?

06:18.250 --> 06:19.958
Do kids like Mister Boss get a free entry?

06:22.000 --> 06:22.583
Super Speed!

06:27.291 --> 06:29.250
Hey, hey! That power sphera belongs to me!

06:30.541 --> 06:31.500
Is that what you think?

06:32.250 --> 06:32.750
Attack!

06:39.416 --> 06:40.583
That hurts! Hey! No biting!

06:40.875 --> 06:42.583
Please stop hurting me, Mister Gorilla!

06:44.833 --> 06:46.208
Please don't hurt us anymore...

06:46.500 --> 06:47.333
We won't do it again!

06:47.875 --> 06:49.250
You don't have to worry about me.

06:49.958 --> 06:51.458
But... I don’t know about BoBoiBoy.

06:52.083 --> 06:52.583
BoBoiBoy?

06:55.000 --> 06:55.708
-Take this!
-Uh oh!

06:56.250 --> 06:57.166
Thunderstorm Slash!

06:58.083 --> 06:58.583
No!

07:01.250 --> 07:02.125
Gopal, are you okay?

07:05.791 --> 07:06.291
I'm okay...

07:08.166 --> 07:08.750
Thanks, Yaya...

07:12.250 --> 07:12.750
Mama! Mama!

07:17.666 --> 07:18.166
Mama!

07:19.500 --> 07:20.000
Baby!

07:22.416 --> 07:22.916
Mama!

07:24.208 --> 07:24.708
Baby!

07:26.541 --> 07:27.041
Ma-

07:31.833 --> 07:32.666
Ow that hurts. Huh?

07:33.958 --> 07:36.375
That's a nice cushion you’ve
got there Mister Boss.

07:36.458 --> 07:37.125
Where did you get it?

07:44.083 --> 07:45.250
EggaBot's safe and sound.

07:45.708 --> 07:46.708
Let's get out of here!

07:50.208 --> 07:51.791
Captain Papa, everyone's on board.

07:54.666 --> 07:55.583
Ow! Ow! That hurts!

07:57.791 --> 07:58.291
Oh, my back!

08:01.000 --> 08:02.500
I wouldn't want to be in their place.

08:03.291 --> 08:05.208
What are you waiting for?
Let's go BoBoiBoy!

08:05.791 --> 08:07.750
-Help! Somebody help!
-You bring Gopal inside.

08:09.166 --> 08:09.750
-Where are you going?!

08:09.833 --> 08:11.958
-I can't just leave Adu Du and Probe like
that!

08:12.041 --> 08:12.791
Elemental Power!

08:13.958 --> 08:15.000
BoBoiBoy Triple Split!

08:22.250 --> 08:23.500
SECTOR Z55-2P SOLARIA GALAXY

08:43.916 --> 08:44.791
Get ready everyone!

08:51.250 --> 08:52.125
Move it, slowpokes!

08:53.083 --> 08:54.333
We don't have time to waste!

08:55.208 --> 08:57.083
Secure the perimeter! Set up the charges.

09:00.125 --> 09:00.625
Ready, Boss!

09:12.250 --> 09:13.208
Grab as much as you can.

09:15.000 --> 09:15.958
Hey! Fill up the cargo!

09:16.416 --> 09:17.750
-Okay, Boss!
-Move it, move it!

09:19.041 --> 09:20.000
We're going to be rich!

09:27.791 --> 09:28.916
We are running out of time.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.583
Boss! Take a look at this!

09:32.083 --> 09:32.583
What is it?

09:33.666 --> 09:34.166
Huh?!

09:36.458 --> 09:37.541
There’s someone inside?

09:42.583 --> 09:43.166
100 YEARS AGO

10:12.166 --> 10:14.291
Stop hiding behind your shield
and face me coward!

10:22.291 --> 10:22.791
I’ll show you!

10:23.583 --> 10:24.250
Take this!

10:26.666 --> 10:27.250
Crystal...

10:28.708 --> 10:29.208
-Trident!

10:39.833 --> 10:40.666
You’re not going anywhere!

10:41.666 --> 10:42.375
Crystal Prison!

10:44.208 --> 10:44.708
Stop!

10:47.750 --> 10:49.375
I will be taking your elemental powers!

10:59.208 --> 10:59.791
Gamma Blast!

11:16.916 --> 11:17.416
No!

11:45.750 --> 11:46.250
Good work!

11:46.750 --> 11:48.916
Yet another Power Sphera
has been acquired safely!

11:49.500 --> 11:50.375
Thank you, Commander!

11:51.458 --> 11:52.625
I wouldn't call that safely.

11:52.750 --> 11:53.250
What?!

11:53.375 --> 11:55.041
BoBoiBoy saved Adu Du and Probe again.

11:55.583 --> 11:56.208
Watch this!

11:58.625 --> 12:00.041
That was not a wise move BoBoiBoy.

12:01.041 --> 12:02.666
You could have jeopardized the mission.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.958
BoBoiBoy should just stick
to the mission plan

12:05.083 --> 12:08.333
-instead of wasting time on saving Adu Du.
-What is all this fuss about, Cadets?!

12:09.833 --> 12:10.333
Admiral!

12:12.083 --> 12:13.458
It's nothing, Admiral Tarung!

12:13.583 --> 12:14.083
Nothing?!

12:14.583 --> 12:17.833
BoBoiBoy jeopardized the mission again!
He rescued Adu Du and Probe!

12:17.958 --> 12:18.458
What?!

12:20.375 --> 12:20.875
But...

12:21.000 --> 12:22.708
We still rescued the Power Sphera EggaBot!

12:23.958 --> 12:24.958
That's right, Admiral!

12:25.166 --> 12:27.416
BoBoiBoy and friends have
successfully rescued

12:27.500 --> 12:29.958
all the Power Spheras in every
mission they’ve been given.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.916
To date BoBoiBoy's team is the highest
achieving team in TAPOPS.

12:35.916 --> 12:36.416
Admirable.

12:37.666 --> 12:38.833
Good work BoBoiBoy and team!

12:39.416 --> 12:41.291
Looking at all your previous achievements,

12:41.541 --> 12:43.708
the leave you have all been
applying for has been...

12:46.458 --> 12:46.958
Approved!

12:47.791 --> 12:49.875
-Congratulations!
-Yay! We're going back home!

12:51.166 --> 12:53.583
Yay! I was getting sick of looking
at the Admiral's face!

12:53.708 --> 12:54.458
What did you say?!

12:55.875 --> 12:56.708
It's nothing, sir!

13:10.041 --> 13:10.875
How much did we get?

13:12.083 --> 13:13.083
About half a ton, sir!

13:13.625 --> 13:16.083
What? That comet is only accessible
once a century...

13:17.625 --> 13:19.375
but we only brought in half
a ton of crystals?!

13:22.500 --> 13:24.416
We shouldn’t have saved
that guy in the crystal!

13:38.375 --> 13:39.375
Are you referring to me?

13:42.958 --> 13:43.458
How the...

13:44.250 --> 13:45.625
How did he get out of the crystal?

13:47.000 --> 13:47.833
What is this place?

13:49.583 --> 13:50.500
Wh-who- who are you?!

13:52.250 --> 13:52.750
Retak'ka.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.500
And who might you be?

13:58.750 --> 13:59.416
I’ll ask again.

14:00.791 --> 14:01.375
Who are you?!

14:10.166 --> 14:10.958
We are just crystal miners!

14:12.583 --> 14:13.208
How peculiar.

14:15.250 --> 14:16.750
I still have remnants of this power?

14:20.791 --> 14:21.291
Retak'ka?

14:22.291 --> 14:22.916
The Retak’ka?

14:23.458 --> 14:25.416
The legendary master of
the elemental powers!

14:26.458 --> 14:28.041
Huh? Master of the Elemental Powers?

14:28.583 --> 14:29.291
But I thought...

14:30.000 --> 14:32.375
The Elemental Powers belong
to that kid named BoBoiBoy?

14:33.041 --> 14:34.958
Yeah! That superhero kid
from TAPOPS right?!

14:38.166 --> 14:39.000
Explain yourself!

14:40.125 --> 14:41.291
Who is BoBoiBoy and TAPOPS?

14:42.666 --> 14:44.583
They are... The protectors
of Power Spheras!

14:45.875 --> 14:47.083
What? Power spheras you say?

14:48.958 --> 14:49.958
You will take me to them!

14:52.166 --> 14:53.250
Why should I listen to you?!

14:58.291 --> 14:59.125
I give you two reasons.

15:00.916 --> 15:02.166
For the sake of your safety...

15:03.291 --> 15:05.333
And... for you to harvest
even more crystals...

15:07.583 --> 15:08.583
Even more... crystals?

15:17.333 --> 15:18.708
Good evening, Mister Boss!

15:18.833 --> 15:20.000
How are you feeling today?

15:21.791 --> 15:22.291
Ow! Ow ow ow!

15:23.833 --> 15:24.666
Take it easy will you?

15:25.666 --> 15:26.375
Oh please, Mister Boss...

15:26.500 --> 15:28.000
It’s just a little bump on your head.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.083
And a little Penguin smackdown.

15:31.125 --> 15:32.125
Stop being so dramatic.

15:33.208 --> 15:34.208
Hey! Easy for you to say!

15:35.208 --> 15:37.083
You're just a robot! You
don't feel any pain!

15:37.625 --> 15:39.666
Well excuse me. Robots
do feel pain, you know?

15:41.916 --> 15:42.416
What do you mean?

15:43.291 --> 15:45.208
My heart is in pain working
for a boss like you.

15:46.000 --> 15:46.500
Ow!

15:47.375 --> 15:49.500
This is not the time to be
making ridiculous jokes!

15:50.250 --> 15:51.833
Go out and find BoBoiBoy's location!

15:52.375 --> 15:53.000
Oh, okay okay.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.125
This old alien’s never going to learn.

15:56.583 --> 15:57.291
What did you say?!

15:57.875 --> 15:58.375
Nothing!

15:58.500 --> 16:00.875
I said, Mister Boss, don't forget
to eat your medicines.

16:06.541 --> 16:08.125
Finally... we have arrived on Earth.

16:10.416 --> 16:11.875
I can smell Amma's curry from here!

16:30.250 --> 16:31.375
Oh! They’re finally here!

16:32.875 --> 16:34.208
My beloved son is finally home!

16:54.875 --> 16:55.375
Tok Aba!

16:56.500 --> 16:57.208
BoBoiBoy!

17:00.291 --> 17:00.875
-Mom!
-Mama!

17:02.666 --> 17:03.291
-Yaya!
-Ying!

17:05.250 --> 17:06.791
My dear boy! How I’ve missed you so- Huh?

17:10.125 --> 17:11.541
I'm coming for you, Amma's curry!

17:12.875 --> 17:14.333
Hey! Why you! Stop right there!

17:14.875 --> 17:18.083
Hey! Come back here! You ungrateful child!
-Wait for me! Amma's curry!

17:18.166 --> 17:19.083
That's Gopal for you.

17:19.416 --> 17:20.416
He went straight back home

17:22.166 --> 17:22.666
Awesome…

17:23.416 --> 17:24.250
How are you, Tok?

17:24.833 --> 17:25.458
Hmm, I'm fine…

17:27.125 --> 17:30.041
I can't believe it's been 3 months.
I’ve missed you so much, BoBoiBoy.

17:31.583 --> 17:32.958
I’ve really missed you too, Tok.

17:40.125 --> 17:40.708
Papa is home!

17:46.208 --> 17:48.083
Huh? Where are my honey
pumpkins of justice?

17:49.750 --> 17:50.708
Yay Papa! You’re home!

17:53.458 --> 17:53.958
Pipi!

17:54.916 --> 17:55.458
Papa!

17:57.041 --> 17:57.791
Oh my little girl!

18:01.541 --> 18:03.166
-I've missed you so much!
-Papa! Papa!

18:05.500 --> 18:07.083
How many evil aliens have you beaten?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.625
How many Power Spheras have you saved?

18:10.291 --> 18:11.916
Tell me, Papa! Tell me everything!

18:14.375 --> 18:15.291
It's nothing much...

18:15.958 --> 18:17.875
I'll say... around twelve
to thirteen dozens!

18:18.875 --> 18:20.041
What a bald-faced lie...

18:21.583 --> 18:22.666
A dozen equals twelve...

18:24.041 --> 18:25.291
Twelve to thirteen dozens...

18:27.000 --> 18:27.500
Wow!

18:28.125 --> 18:30.166
One hundred forty four to
one hundred fifty six?!

18:31.416 --> 18:32.000
That's a lot!

18:32.833 --> 18:34.458
-You're amazing, Papa!
-Oh dear...

18:35.000 --> 18:36.333
You're a clever one aren't you?

18:36.750 --> 18:37.791
Who taught you that?

18:38.375 --> 18:39.208
You did, of course.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.166
When I grow up, I wanna be just like Papa!

18:44.041 --> 18:44.666
I am Pipi Zola!

18:46.416 --> 18:47.333
Daughter of Justice!

18:48.083 --> 18:48.958
Cousin to Cuteness!

18:51.500 --> 18:52.416
Aww, just look at her!

18:54.416 --> 18:55.833
Hey, Justice can be adorable too.

18:57.791 --> 18:58.291
Watch this.

18:58.708 --> 18:59.333
I am Papa Zola!

19:01.000 --> 19:01.958
Lovable enemy of evil!

19:03.583 --> 19:04.333
Adorable ally of-

19:06.708 --> 19:08.916
-I'm going to throw up!
-Come on girls. Let's go home!

19:09.041 --> 19:09.750
Hey hey, wait up!

19:10.541 --> 19:12.250
You haven't seen half of my cuteness yet!

19:15.291 --> 19:16.541
Come now, Papa. Let's go home.

19:17.583 --> 19:18.916
You must be really tired right?

19:20.875 --> 19:22.458
You are absolutely right my darling.

19:23.291 --> 19:23.916
Let us go home!

19:26.500 --> 19:28.416
Alright. Come and help
me close up shop early.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.458
-We have so much to talk about tonight.
-Sure thing Tok Aba.

19:32.458 --> 19:32.958
Huh? Fang?

19:33.791 --> 19:35.333
Huh? Why is he staring off into space?

19:36.791 --> 19:38.250
Fang! Are you coming with us or not?

19:39.416 --> 19:41.208
I don't think so. I have
to guard the spaceship.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.750
EggaBot is still under our protection.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.125
Relax, there's nothing to worry about.

19:47.125 --> 19:47.625
It's safe here.

19:48.625 --> 19:51.250
Yeah! This spaceship has state-of-the-art
defenses anyway!

19:51.875 --> 19:52.500
Come on, Fang.

19:54.041 --> 19:56.166
Well... If you're not gonna
sleep over at my place,

19:57.083 --> 19:59.250
who's going to finish all
of the carrot soup I made?

20:00.375 --> 20:00.916
Carrot soup?!

20:01.916 --> 20:02.625
Wait up, Tok Aba!

20:02.916 --> 20:04.000
I’ll go get my things now!

20:15.708 --> 20:16.833
Caught a big fish at night.

20:18.250 --> 20:19.583
Gonna cook it in curry tonight.

20:24.125 --> 20:26.041
Here you go Fang. One carrot
soup just for you.

20:26.916 --> 20:28.041
Woah, I love carrot soup.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.208
Coming through! Piping hot! Piping hot!

20:32.166 --> 20:34.000
Tok Aba's special chicken curry is ready!

20:34.833 --> 20:36.166
Woah! The curry smells so good!

20:38.208 --> 20:39.791
Compliments to the chef of course.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.041
You didn’t have to cook so much Tok Aba!

20:42.166 --> 20:44.333
Of course I had to. You've
been away for so long.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.083
I’m sure you’ve missed
my cooking am I right?

20:48.500 --> 20:49.458
Got that right Tok Aba!

20:49.958 --> 20:51.958
I haven't eaten anything this
good in three months!

20:52.083 --> 20:53.791
Now the table is set and dinner is served.

20:55.666 --> 20:57.750
What are you waiting for
BoBoiBoy? Start talking.

20:59.208 --> 21:00.958
What do you want to hear about, Tok Aba?

21:01.083 --> 21:03.958
Why, tell me all about your TAPOPS
missions of course. What else?

21:06.250 --> 21:08.041
I don't think there's much to talk about.

21:08.125 --> 21:08.750
Nothing much?

21:09.291 --> 21:11.208
BoBoiBoy has saved countless
Power Spheras!

21:11.291 --> 21:12.500
Isn't that right, Fang?

21:13.875 --> 21:16.083
I guess. But he doesn't stop
at saving Power Spheras.

21:17.208 --> 21:18.708
He even saves the bad
guys while he's at it.

21:18.833 --> 21:20.875
-What! You saved the bad guys?
-Yeah, Tok Aba!

21:22.125 --> 21:23.875
Can you believe he saved Adu Du again?!

21:24.000 --> 21:24.500
Oh, Adu Du.

21:26.125 --> 21:27.750
It’s fine. That alien boy isn't so bad.

21:30.250 --> 21:30.833
Huh?!

21:30.958 --> 21:31.791
You got that right!

21:32.041 --> 21:33.208
He's nothing more than a troublemaker!

21:33.333 --> 21:33.833
Gopal?

21:34.500 --> 21:35.000
How did you-

21:35.791 --> 21:36.291
Easy peasy.

21:36.791 --> 21:37.708
Where there is curry...

21:39.291 --> 21:40.166
There Gopal will be!

21:40.791 --> 21:42.375
As usual... Always quick with a quip.

21:44.541 --> 21:45.791
So, uh, have a seat! Come, come!

21:46.958 --> 21:48.166
Make yourselves at home!

21:48.291 --> 21:49.708
Hey! You took the entire fish?!

21:51.000 --> 21:52.166
You want me to throw you out?

21:52.916 --> 21:53.875
Please don't, Tok Aba!

21:54.208 --> 21:55.791
Who's going to finish all this food?

22:05.708 --> 22:07.208
-A little bit higher. Higher.
-Here?

22:07.291 --> 22:08.083
Ah... That’s the spot.

22:11.250 --> 22:12.500
Papa, what are you looking at?

22:12.958 --> 22:14.750
Just looking at these mission photos.

22:15.041 --> 22:16.166
Wow! You're so cool, Papa!

22:18.125 --> 22:19.250
Don’t you ever get scared?

22:21.291 --> 22:23.166
Everyone knows, Justice
is afraid of no one!

22:25.750 --> 22:27.083
Woah! I wanna be just like Papa!

22:30.666 --> 22:31.291
I am Pipi Zola!

22:33.125 --> 22:34.333
Protector of Power Spheras!

22:37.958 --> 22:39.583
Oh dear... You're gonna break my back!

22:41.083 --> 22:42.416
Bring me along next time, Papa.

22:43.875 --> 22:45.541
I’ll help you beat up those evil aliens!

22:46.000 --> 22:47.166
Ow, ow, ow ow ow! Let go of me!

22:51.791 --> 22:52.750
The back of Justice...

22:56.125 --> 22:56.625
Papa?

22:57.708 --> 22:58.208
Yes, Pipi?

22:59.958 --> 23:00.958
Why are your eyes so big?

23:01.833 --> 23:02.916
Hey, do you need glasses?

23:03.375 --> 23:04.750
Can I see a Power Sphera, please?

23:06.208 --> 23:07.291
Ha-ha! Look all you want!

23:08.166 --> 23:10.291
I don’t mean here. I wanna
see it with my own eyes.

23:12.000 --> 23:12.666
Please say yes.

23:14.125 --> 23:16.041
Here you go, here! Close
enough for your eyes?

23:20.500 --> 23:21.416
That's not funny!

23:22.875 --> 23:24.250
And I thought your eyes were big,

23:24.666 --> 23:25.833
your teeth are even bigger!

23:26.291 --> 23:28.291
Alright, alright. We'll
go in the morning okay?

23:29.500 --> 23:30.000
Yay!

23:31.708 --> 23:33.375
Promise, okay? Take me there tomorrow.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.625
Okay! Like I always say...

23:38.000 --> 23:39.833
Justice... never breaks any promises!

24:06.625 --> 24:07.125
I'm in, Probe!

24:10.291 --> 24:12.000
Upload the ninja programme immediately.

24:13.000 --> 24:13.750
On it, Mister Boss!

24:13.875 --> 24:15.458
Ninja programme, uploaded and ready!

24:33.916 --> 24:34.666
That was too easy.

24:40.583 --> 24:42.291
I have a visual on the Power Sphera vault.

24:47.083 --> 24:48.458
Not even ninjas can get through!

24:49.041 --> 24:49.958
Find another route, Probe!

24:50.083 --> 24:51.666
Oh, we don't have to, Mister Boss!

24:52.208 --> 24:53.541
Switching to, Manual Control!

24:54.166 --> 24:54.708
Get ready...

24:56.958 --> 24:57.458
Onwards!

25:00.500 --> 25:01.375
Hold up Probe! Stop!

25:16.375 --> 25:18.208
Ow... You actually rolled
me up into a ball!

25:20.791 --> 25:22.666
It’s like they say, better
be safe and round!

25:26.875 --> 25:27.958
It’s safe and sound not round!

25:30.250 --> 25:30.750
EggaBot?!

25:33.375 --> 25:34.000
Excellent...

25:34.583 --> 25:37.208
At long last. This priceless Power
Sphera will finally be mine! Huh?!

25:41.708 --> 25:42.208
Wow!

25:43.125 --> 25:43.625
Adu Du?!

25:44.291 --> 25:45.458
What are you doing here?!

25:46.000 --> 25:46.500
Oh no!

25:49.791 --> 25:50.791
What? Probe is here too?

25:52.041 --> 25:53.250
Huh? Who is this little girl?

25:54.083 --> 25:54.708
I am Pipi Zola!

25:56.375 --> 25:56.875
Enemy of evil,

25:58.291 --> 25:59.208
daughter of Justice!

26:00.291 --> 26:00.958
Huh? Pipi Zola?

26:02.833 --> 26:03.333
Yeah! Pipi!

26:04.833 --> 26:05.333
Putri

26:05.500 --> 26:06.000
Intan

26:06.208 --> 26:06.708
Payung

26:06.833 --> 26:07.333
Indah!

26:07.708 --> 26:08.208
Zola!

26:08.541 --> 26:09.041
Zulaikha

26:09.500 --> 26:10.000
Odelia

26:10.458 --> 26:10.958
Ladasyia

26:11.708 --> 26:12.250
Absyari!

26:12.375 --> 26:13.583
Wow, that's such a long name!

26:14.375 --> 26:15.916
Must be hard to fill up school forms.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.458
Don't have to, Papa does it for me.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.958
That's right... It is now...
too late for regrets...

26:23.583 --> 26:25.583
Hey, hey! Stop being friendly
with them, Probe!

26:26.083 --> 26:26.791
Get them now- Huh?!

26:27.791 --> 26:28.458
Where did they go?!

26:29.416 --> 26:30.333
Where is EggaBot?!

26:30.583 --> 26:31.083
Come on, you.

26:31.708 --> 26:33.125
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

26:33.833 --> 26:34.583
Stop right there!

26:36.125 --> 26:37.083
See you later invader!

26:42.958 --> 26:44.125
Let’s get out of here, Pipi!

26:46.458 --> 26:47.958
Where you think you’re going, huh?!

26:49.166 --> 26:49.791
Come back here!

26:51.625 --> 26:52.125
Papa?

26:52.875 --> 26:54.458
Why are you screaming like that?

26:55.041 --> 26:56.375
Huh? Uh, what I mean to say is...

26:57.791 --> 26:59.375
-Please help this macho man!
-Stop!

27:00.083 --> 27:00.583
Don't run!

27:00.958 --> 27:02.541
Drat! Probe! Activate Chaser Mode!

27:03.416 --> 27:04.208
Okay, Mister Boss!

27:04.291 --> 27:04.958
Chaser Mode on!

27:05.291 --> 27:05.791
Huh?

27:06.291 --> 27:06.916
Swim Mode?

27:08.333 --> 27:09.041
You're done for!

27:09.750 --> 27:11.083
Why am I swimming on the floor?!

27:12.000 --> 27:13.125
Uh oh! Sorry, Mister Boss!

27:14.208 --> 27:15.583
But you're going pretty fast!

27:16.791 --> 27:18.208
Just keep swimming, Mister Boss!

27:20.250 --> 27:21.166
Faster! Backstroke!

27:23.333 --> 27:25.125
-Hey! What are you doing?
-Breaststroke!

27:25.666 --> 27:26.291
Dolphin leap!

27:32.916 --> 27:33.750
Wow! Adu Dulphin!

27:35.375 --> 27:36.875
Activate EggaBot now my little one!

27:39.666 --> 27:40.166
Get inside!

27:44.000 --> 27:44.666
Hey, hey! Stop!

27:50.125 --> 27:50.833
Get out of there!

27:52.416 --> 27:53.041
How do I do this?

27:57.208 --> 27:58.083
Scanning identity.

28:00.791 --> 28:01.541
Calibrating size.

28:02.375 --> 28:03.083
Yay! I've got it!

28:07.708 --> 28:08.666
Activation complete.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.583
Welcome. Please insert your name.

28:13.666 --> 28:14.208
Um... Putri...

28:17.083 --> 28:19.000
-Intan...
-Don’t you dare activate EggaBot!

28:20.833 --> 28:21.666
Ow! That hurts!

28:22.250 --> 28:23.958
What’s taking you so long in there, Pipi?

28:25.041 --> 28:26.291
This is your fault, Papa!

28:26.416 --> 28:28.291
You’re the one who gave
me such a long name!

28:31.000 --> 28:31.500
Take this!

28:39.250 --> 28:40.833
Don't you dare lay a finger on my Papa!

28:42.250 --> 28:43.625
Mode: Hardshell Tortoise Pipi!

28:54.625 --> 28:55.541
Hardshell tortoise?

28:56.250 --> 28:57.916
Aww… you’re such a cutie pie aren’t you?

29:00.000 --> 29:01.333
I’ll show you who’s a cutie pie!

29:03.583 --> 29:04.708
Hardshell Tortoise Roll!

29:05.750 --> 29:06.375
Wait!

29:06.958 --> 29:07.458
Take this!

29:13.583 --> 29:14.708
Ow... My whole body hurts.

29:18.875 --> 29:20.208
-What do we have here?
-Oh no...

29:21.333 --> 29:22.833
Just what are you two doing here?!

29:23.541 --> 29:24.041
Nothing!

29:24.208 --> 29:25.958
We’re just here on Earth for sight seeing!

29:27.958 --> 29:28.541
Sight-seeing?

29:29.083 --> 29:30.583
More like Power Sphera stealing.

29:31.625 --> 29:32.125
Pipi?

29:32.375 --> 29:33.375
Wait is that EggaBot?

29:35.000 --> 29:35.500
Indeed!

29:36.333 --> 29:37.750
Without the daughter of Justice,

29:38.500 --> 29:40.208
our Power Sphera would have been stolen!

29:40.750 --> 29:41.500
Way to go, Pipi!

29:42.166 --> 29:44.416
Throw these troublemakers
in the cells of Justice!

29:45.625 --> 29:46.166
Okay, Captain!

29:48.750 --> 29:49.875
Please! Let us out please!

29:50.916 --> 29:52.583
Don’t worry. You’ll be out in no time.

29:54.083 --> 29:54.875
Huh?! When is that?!

29:55.916 --> 29:56.750
When chickens fly.

29:58.375 --> 29:59.958
I should never have followed you.

30:00.375 --> 30:01.875
-Adu Du could have-
-BoBoiBoy!

30:02.666 --> 30:03.625
What’s wrong, Ochobot?

30:03.750 --> 30:06.250
There’s an emergency transmission
from the commander!

30:06.333 --> 30:07.375
An emergency transmission?!

30:09.291 --> 30:11.000
I tried to contact you,
but the line was cut.

30:12.166 --> 30:13.375
Why is everyone panicking?

30:13.958 --> 30:14.833
Listen up, everyone.

30:14.916 --> 30:17.083
-TAPOPS Station is under attack!
-Under attack?!

30:17.666 --> 30:19.166
As soon as you receive this message…

30:19.291 --> 30:20.375
Head to this coordinate!

30:20.791 --> 30:22.166
Follow my exact instructions!

30:25.250 --> 30:25.791
Commander!

30:27.416 --> 30:29.125
What’s going on? What's the message?

30:29.250 --> 30:30.500
Commander just contacted us!

30:30.625 --> 30:32.291
TAPOPS Station has been attacked!

30:32.416 --> 30:33.500
What?! Say it isn't so!

30:34.791 --> 30:37.916
The coordinates given by the commander
point to a specific planet.

30:38.333 --> 30:39.000
Planet Quabaq.

30:39.875 --> 30:40.583
Planet Quabaq?

30:41.125 --> 30:42.375
What kind of a planet is that?

30:42.500 --> 30:45.041
-It looks kinda creepy!
-That planet is not important!

30:45.708 --> 30:46.500
We are not going there!

30:47.041 --> 30:48.833
We need to go and save everyone at TAPOPS!

30:49.833 --> 30:51.083
Hey! Weren't you listening?!

30:51.541 --> 30:54.708
The commander specifically told us to go
to the planet and follow his instructions!

30:54.833 --> 30:57.166
But... we can't just leave
them and not help them out.

30:57.708 --> 30:59.208
Orders are still orders, BoBoiBoy.

30:59.333 --> 31:00.458
What should we do, BoBoiBoy?

31:01.000 --> 31:01.833
I’m ready to teleport.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.750
No! We have to go and help them!

31:06.500 --> 31:08.041
Get ready to teleport to TAPOPS Station!

31:09.208 --> 31:09.958
All hands on deck!

31:11.125 --> 31:12.333
Quick! Get ready for launch!

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Fire up all the engines!

31:16.000 --> 31:16.708
Arm the weapons!

31:17.375 --> 31:19.708
-Shields at maximum!
-Shields at one hundred percent!

31:20.666 --> 31:21.583
All weapons, ready!

31:22.208 --> 31:23.500
Teleportal ready to engage.

31:24.625 --> 31:26.208
Breakfast, ready in five minutes!

31:26.333 --> 31:28.791
Well... Looks like someone’s
asking to be left behind...

31:29.791 --> 31:31.041
Huh? The spaceship is moving!

31:37.208 --> 31:38.708
Open the teleportal now, Ochobot!

31:39.208 --> 31:40.083
Okay!

31:40.166 --> 31:41.125
Teleportation Power!

31:49.958 --> 31:50.708
We will arrive in...

31:51.500 --> 31:52.208
Three...

31:52.750 --> 31:53.291
Two...

31:53.916 --> 31:54.416
One...

31:56.250 --> 31:57.375
Warning! Incoming object!

31:58.416 --> 31:59.166
Incoming object!

32:05.916 --> 32:07.125
Warning! Warning! Warning!

32:08.833 --> 32:09.666
Watch out Captain Papa!

32:11.208 --> 32:12.375
Too late! Brace for impact!

32:21.333 --> 32:22.416
Shields at fifty percent.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.000
Shields at fifty percent.

32:25.583 --> 32:26.791
What did we hit just now?

32:28.333 --> 32:29.833
That’s... That’s TAPOPS Station!

32:32.000 --> 32:33.250
That’s... That’s impossible!

32:36.458 --> 32:37.875
TAPOPS Station has been destroyed?!

32:50.666 --> 32:52.833
Still refusing to disclose
the boy’s location?

32:54.583 --> 32:56.083
You can torture me all you want, but-

33:00.041 --> 33:00.541
BoBoiBoy?!

33:01.625 --> 33:02.875
Get out of here before he...

33:03.541 --> 33:04.041
Silence!

33:09.000 --> 33:09.500
Commander!

33:14.250 --> 33:16.666
It appears all of this destruction
has been unnecessary.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.708
You should’ve arrived here sooner, boy.

33:24.958 --> 33:26.583
Even Admiral Tarung has been beaten?

33:26.708 --> 33:27.208
Oh no...

33:29.375 --> 33:30.291
Who are these people?

33:32.000 --> 33:32.833
What in the world…!

33:33.791 --> 33:35.375
What? What’s wrong, Captain Papa?!

33:35.791 --> 33:36.541
Look! Over there!

33:42.208 --> 33:42.708
Papa, Papa…

33:44.000 --> 33:44.708
I'm so sleepy...

33:46.125 --> 33:46.666
Pipi Zola?!

33:47.416 --> 33:48.625
Oh no! How did she get in here!

33:50.500 --> 33:51.958
My wife is totally going to kill me!

33:55.625 --> 33:57.291
Who are you?! Why did you come here huh?!

34:00.083 --> 34:00.708
I am Retak’ka.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.041
Pleased to make your acquaintance...
BoBoiBoy.

34:06.666 --> 34:07.166
Huh? Me?

34:08.541 --> 34:09.833
What do you want from me huh?!

34:10.416 --> 34:11.375
Return my powers to me.

34:13.333 --> 34:13.916
Your powers?

34:14.541 --> 34:15.041
Yes...

34:16.125 --> 34:17.083
The Elemental Powers!

34:20.541 --> 34:21.041
What?

34:21.750 --> 34:24.791
Did you really think you were the first
to wield the Elemental Powers?

34:26.625 --> 34:28.458
I am the true owner of
the Elemental Powers!

34:30.958 --> 34:31.458
Let go of me!

34:32.166 --> 34:32.791
BoBoiBoy Blaze!

34:33.958 --> 34:34.791
Blazing Chakram!

34:43.500 --> 34:44.083
Impressive.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.375
I never thought a mere child would be
able to use

34:49.250 --> 34:50.625
the second tier elemental power.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.041
I'll make you regret ever coming here!

34:55.500 --> 34:56.125
How arrogant.

34:57.416 --> 34:59.333
Allow me to show you the
true Elemental Power.

35:07.541 --> 35:09.833
Hey! Can't you see my daughter
is trying to sleep here!

35:13.041 --> 35:13.791
What was that?!

35:14.791 --> 35:17.166
This is but a taste of what I
can really do with your power.

35:20.333 --> 35:21.333
Blazing Chakram Throw!

35:28.416 --> 35:29.500
Surely you can do better.

35:31.541 --> 35:32.708
Flaming Fists... Barrage!

35:39.000 --> 35:39.541
Come to me!

35:45.416 --> 35:45.916
BoBoiBoy!

35:47.541 --> 35:49.000
-Slo-Mo Power!
-Gravity Punch!

35:51.833 --> 35:52.833
Crush every one of them!

35:55.458 --> 35:56.125
Shadow Beasts!

36:06.000 --> 36:07.375
High time we get out of here!

36:07.500 --> 36:09.333
-Push me out Probe!
-Okay, Mister Boss!

36:10.916 --> 36:13.333
-Wait Probe! My head's stuck!
-You can do it, Mister Boss!

36:15.958 --> 36:16.541
BoBoiBoy...

36:20.333 --> 36:22.333
The Elemental Powers are wasted
on a child like you!

36:29.291 --> 36:31.041
Surrender now or end up just like them!

36:34.958 --> 36:35.958
Just like them, you say?

36:45.166 --> 36:46.375
He beat them in just one shot?

36:47.708 --> 36:48.708
We have to do something!

36:50.000 --> 36:50.500
Captain!

36:51.375 --> 36:52.708
Take BoBoiBoy and get out of here!

36:54.458 --> 36:56.291
And now it is your turn to fall, BoBoiBoy.

36:58.666 --> 36:59.375
Where are you?!

36:59.500 --> 37:00.083
BoBoiBoy...

37:01.041 --> 37:01.791
Penta Split!

37:07.791 --> 37:08.375
Cyclone Veil!

37:13.000 --> 37:13.666
Binding Vines!

37:20.500 --> 37:21.083
Take this!

37:21.708 --> 37:22.666
Thunderstorm Strike!

37:29.375 --> 37:30.083
How irritating!

37:36.458 --> 37:38.208
This is how you use your Elemental Powers?

37:39.958 --> 37:40.666
By splitting up?

37:41.250 --> 37:41.833
Earth Golem!

37:47.583 --> 37:48.166
How pathetic!

37:49.083 --> 37:49.583
Now, Solar!

37:51.375 --> 37:52.083
What?

37:52.666 --> 37:53.416
Solar Eclipse...

37:54.791 --> 37:55.291
Blast!

38:13.916 --> 38:14.750
Yes... Excellent!

38:16.291 --> 38:17.541
Channel all your powers to me!

38:20.000 --> 38:20.833
Oh no… Solar, stop!

38:22.291 --> 38:23.541
You've made the wrong move!

38:32.791 --> 38:34.541
Perhaps a mere brat like
you do not know...

38:36.166 --> 38:38.375
Splitting only makes your
Elemental Powers weak!

38:40.000 --> 38:41.916
Return your power to its rightful owner!

38:44.125 --> 38:44.708
Gamma Drain!

38:47.708 --> 38:48.208
Solar!

39:03.333 --> 39:04.958
BoBoiBoy only has three powers left!

39:08.666 --> 39:10.375
Long have I waited for this exact moment!

39:14.166 --> 39:14.666
Behold...

39:16.625 --> 39:17.333
Retak'ka Gamma!

39:19.125 --> 39:19.791
Maximum Power!

39:22.125 --> 39:22.916
Earth Barrier-

39:32.833 --> 39:34.625
You are not worthy to wield
the Elemental Powers!

39:36.500 --> 39:37.125
Let… Let me go!

39:40.583 --> 39:41.500
Keep on wishing, boy.

39:42.916 --> 39:44.458
Submit to me... my elemental powers!

39:49.125 --> 39:49.833
Stop... Stop it.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.750
How I have missed the Elemental powers
coursing through my veins.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.583
BoBoiBoy only has three powers left!

40:24.208 --> 40:25.291
We have to help BoBoiBoy!

40:25.875 --> 40:27.750
The time has come to complete
all of my powers

40:29.708 --> 40:30.208
Come to me!

40:36.791 --> 40:37.291
Gopal?

40:39.708 --> 40:40.875
Pull us, pull us up quickly!

40:44.500 --> 40:45.583
Retak’ka Darkwood!

40:52.958 --> 40:54.083
Our spaceship is stuck!

40:54.666 --> 40:56.625
Hey! Get inside! We need
to get going right now!

40:59.291 --> 41:00.583
But... But what about the rest?

41:01.583 --> 41:02.916
Don’t... Don’t worry about us.

41:03.583 --> 41:04.083
Just go!

41:04.666 --> 41:05.375
This is an order!

41:07.583 --> 41:09.500
Don't forget to read my message, BoBoiBoy!

41:10.208 --> 41:10.875
Find Hang Kasa!

41:18.416 --> 41:19.250
Just go, BoBoiBoy!

41:20.750 --> 41:22.041
I... I can't just leave them...

41:22.625 --> 41:23.958
Hurry up BoBoiBoy! We need to go now!

41:24.958 --> 41:25.666
Come on! Come on!

41:28.541 --> 41:29.416
Burn down the vines!

41:30.458 --> 41:31.125
On it, Captain!

41:37.041 --> 41:38.458
Shoot down that spaceship Ayu Yu!

41:39.041 --> 41:39.541
Huh? Ayu Yu?

41:49.625 --> 41:50.375
Oh, Ayu Yu...

41:51.791 --> 41:53.166
Rockets are red, lasers are blue,

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
How I love you, Ayu Yu...

41:59.458 --> 42:00.750
We have entered outer space.

42:01.583 --> 42:02.583
Hey! Hey! Hey! Get back!

42:02.916 --> 42:04.666
Your face is turning blue, Mister Boss!

42:05.500 --> 42:07.041
Shields at critical levels, Captain!

42:07.166 --> 42:08.583
Huh? Open the teleportal now!

42:09.625 --> 42:10.750
Coordinates identified!

42:11.208 --> 42:12.125
Teleportation Power!

42:19.958 --> 42:21.916
Hang on everyone! Engines, maximum power!

42:26.750 --> 42:27.583
There is no escape!

42:34.416 --> 42:35.458
I don't want to die, BoBoiBoy!

43:04.166 --> 43:05.083
Watch out, everyone!

43:19.958 --> 43:21.416
Drat! That brat managed to escape!

43:23.125 --> 43:25.000
Master Retak’ka. What should we do now?

43:26.416 --> 43:27.250
He can try to run...

43:28.625 --> 43:30.083
but he cannot hide from me forever!

43:32.041 --> 43:32.541
Come!

43:32.958 --> 43:33.875
Let's move out Ayu Yu!

43:43.250 --> 43:44.916
But what about this space station?

43:45.041 --> 43:45.708
Annihilate it.

43:48.375 --> 43:48.875
Roger that.

43:59.833 --> 44:00.916
How is the admiral doing?

44:01.125 --> 44:01.625
Is everyone okay?

44:22.250 --> 44:23.708
Warning. Shields at zero percent.

44:25.458 --> 44:26.458
Evacuate immediately.

44:29.458 --> 44:30.333
Huh? Papa's still asleep?

44:32.291 --> 44:33.208
Wake up Papa! Wake up!

44:34.666 --> 44:35.291
Don't be lazy!

44:38.750 --> 44:39.666
Aha! I know what to do!

44:40.666 --> 44:41.750
Nostril Poke of Justice!

44:44.250 --> 44:45.541
Hey! What’s the big idea, Pipi?!

44:50.708 --> 44:51.583
The window's broken!

44:52.583 --> 44:54.541
Huh?! Watch your step, Pipi!
The mud is acidic!

44:56.375 --> 44:57.375
We gotta get out of here!

44:58.208 --> 45:01.000
Not yet! We have to retrieve the
information that Commander sent us!

45:01.125 --> 45:01.625
Ochobot!

45:02.291 --> 45:03.958
The data in the computer is corrupt!

45:11.291 --> 45:13.208
The spaceship is sinking!
Run for your lives!

45:15.375 --> 45:16.291
Just get what you can!

45:18.375 --> 45:20.208
-Commander instructed us to find someone
named...

45:20.291 --> 45:20.833
-...Hang Kasa!

45:20.916 --> 45:21.541
Hang Kasa!

45:22.125 --> 45:22.625
Hang Kasa?

45:23.208 --> 45:24.708
Oh no, what is BoBoiBoy still doing?

45:26.416 --> 45:27.125
Oh no!

45:27.250 --> 45:27.958
What is it, Papa?

45:28.500 --> 45:30.000
Justice forgot to pack our dinner!

45:32.000 --> 45:32.708
Wait for me here!

45:34.083 --> 45:35.000
What in the world...?

45:35.541 --> 45:36.208
Faster Ochobot!

45:36.750 --> 45:38.708
I've got the location! It's North of here!

45:39.583 --> 45:40.625
On the mountainside!

45:42.000 --> 45:42.708
-We have to go now!
-Wait!

45:43.666 --> 45:45.166
-I'm trying to get all of the mission
data!

45:45.250 --> 45:46.000
-There's no time!

45:46.583 --> 45:47.708
Dey, come on Captain Papa!

45:55.875 --> 45:57.333
Tuna, baked beans, tomato soup...

45:58.708 --> 45:59.666
Ooh, chicken rendang!

46:00.333 --> 46:01.875
Dey, Captain Papa! Get over here!

46:02.708 --> 46:03.666
You wanna get yourself killed?

46:05.083 --> 46:07.000
Better to die for food,
than to die without it!

46:08.625 --> 46:10.083
Huh? What are you doing there Pipi!

46:11.250 --> 46:13.208
Nothing, I just forgot to
take EggaBot with us.

46:15.208 --> 46:16.083
No! Be careful Pipi!

46:18.583 --> 46:20.333
Teddy bear, teddy bear, touch the ground!

46:21.375 --> 46:22.958
Teddy bear, teddy bear, turn around!

46:30.958 --> 46:32.208
Help! Help me, boy! BoBoiBoy!

46:34.125 --> 46:34.625
BoBoiBoy Ice!

46:35.500 --> 46:36.125
Freezing Ice!

46:44.375 --> 46:44.875
Get out now!

46:46.125 --> 46:46.958
Sprint of Justice!

46:51.416 --> 46:52.208
Hurry! Hurry!

46:55.500 --> 46:56.458
Watch out Captain Papa!

47:10.583 --> 47:11.708
Woah! That was cool, Papa!

47:14.708 --> 47:15.625
Hashtag #PapaTries.

47:25.750 --> 47:27.458
Oh no! Adu Du and Probe are still inside!

47:28.541 --> 47:29.125
You're right!

47:31.791 --> 47:33.500
It's empty! They're not inside the ship!

47:35.041 --> 47:36.000
Huh? Where did they go?

48:04.541 --> 48:05.708
Oh, my spaceship is ruined.

48:08.458 --> 48:09.208
That’s okay Papa!

48:09.625 --> 48:11.333
I’ll get you a new one
from the store okay?

48:12.791 --> 48:14.666
This is Hang Kasa. Find him and get the...

48:16.208 --> 48:16.875
But be careful!

48:17.250 --> 48:18.625
According to intel, he is the-

48:21.333 --> 48:22.958
I’ve lost four of my Elemental Powers.

48:23.833 --> 48:25.500
How would Hang Kasa be able to help me?

48:25.833 --> 48:27.333
I'm not sure. The data is corrupted.

48:27.875 --> 48:29.291
Let's just find Hang Kasa first.

48:30.416 --> 48:31.583
Everyone’s in a bad mood...

48:32.541 --> 48:33.750
Looks like I have to cheer them up!

48:34.500 --> 48:35.833
Papa! I have a song just for you.

48:37.375 --> 48:38.125
What song is that?

48:39.166 --> 48:40.416
Papa goes to the supermarket,

48:42.250 --> 48:43.750
Papa buys some chocolates by the pound,

48:45.625 --> 48:47.083
Papa finishes all the chocolates,

48:48.958 --> 48:50.541
That's why his tummy is really round!

48:52.041 --> 48:53.708
Hey... Stop making fun of my tummy okay?

48:54.458 --> 48:55.708
I’m so hungry- Let’s stop and eat!

48:56.875 --> 48:58.875
Did you get any updates from
TAPOPS station, Ochobot?

48:59.541 --> 49:01.208
Not yet. I can’t seem to contact them...

49:02.583 --> 49:03.083
Oh dear...

49:03.541 --> 49:04.666
Hey, let’s take a break!

49:05.416 --> 49:06.625
I can't feel my legs anymore!

49:07.750 --> 49:09.291
I’m okay. I don’t feel tired at all.

49:09.958 --> 49:10.458
Hey!

49:10.666 --> 49:12.333
Have you forgotten I was carrying you?!

49:12.625 --> 49:14.750
Why don’t you try carrying
me instead? How about it?!

49:17.291 --> 49:17.791
No, I don't wanna!

49:18.833 --> 49:20.333
You’re right... It is getting dark.

49:22.916 --> 49:24.375
I saw something in the bushes!

49:28.250 --> 49:29.750
What?! What kind of animal is that?!

49:34.125 --> 49:34.791
That’s a Kang Kong!

49:36.083 --> 49:36.583
Kang Kong?!

49:37.000 --> 49:39.166
Yes! This creature moves
slowly during the day,

49:39.791 --> 49:41.208
but it’s extremely fast at night!

49:42.208 --> 49:44.541
What are you talking about?
They don't look fast to me.

49:46.083 --> 49:46.583
Gopal!

49:47.125 --> 49:48.041
No! Stay away from me!

49:50.333 --> 49:50.833
What?

49:52.541 --> 49:53.708
What's wrong with this guy?

49:53.833 --> 49:54.791
Hey. It's so slow Papa!

49:56.541 --> 49:57.916
They must be sensitive to light!

49:58.458 --> 50:01.083
The flashlight tricks them
into thinking it's daytime!

50:01.208 --> 50:01.916
Oh! In that case…

50:03.083 --> 50:03.791
BoBoiBoy Solar!

50:07.583 --> 50:09.208
Your Solar element is gone, BoBoiBoy!

50:11.125 --> 50:11.875
BoBoiBoy Blaze!

50:18.250 --> 50:19.833
Oh no, there’s so many Kang Kong Papa!

50:25.500 --> 50:26.750
Huh? Why is my flame dying out?

50:27.958 --> 50:29.750
You don’t have enough energy, BoBoiBoy!

50:31.541 --> 50:32.708
Oh no! Don’t die on me right now!

50:36.041 --> 50:36.541
Oh my heart!

50:38.250 --> 50:39.333
I’m going to bed now okay?

50:39.791 --> 50:40.583
It's a school night.

50:41.125 --> 50:42.333
Hey! Don't you hide in there!

50:42.541 --> 50:43.875
You’re not even in school yet!

50:43.958 --> 50:44.750
Come out and help me!

50:46.125 --> 50:46.625
Oh no!

50:49.333 --> 50:50.083
Run for it everyone!

50:54.375 --> 50:54.875
Stay away!

51:01.833 --> 51:02.541
Who… Who is that?

51:05.250 --> 51:05.833
Do not worry.

51:06.750 --> 51:07.708
You are all safe now...

51:34.083 --> 51:34.583
My head hurts.

51:36.500 --> 51:37.166
Huh? Where am I?

51:39.125 --> 51:40.583
You are at a safe place BoBoiBoy...

51:43.833 --> 51:44.791
How do you know my name?

51:45.375 --> 51:45.958
From them...

51:46.166 --> 51:47.458
-It's so yummy, Papa.
-Yeah, let's eat!

51:47.541 --> 51:48.458
Hey! BoBoiBoy’s awake!

51:49.000 --> 51:49.750
What? He’s awake?

51:51.208 --> 51:52.625
Here, eat up! Eat up quickly, Pipi!

51:53.166 --> 51:55.041
We don’t want him finishing
up our breakfast.

51:55.916 --> 51:56.666
Uh... Who are you?

51:58.791 --> 52:00.208
My name… is Master Kasa the Black.

52:02.541 --> 52:04.208
Disciple of Grandmaster Tok the White.

52:05.500 --> 52:06.416
But you can call me...

52:08.166 --> 52:08.666
Bro!

52:09.583 --> 52:10.125
Bro?

52:13.125 --> 52:14.666
Just kidding. You may call me Tok...

52:16.583 --> 52:17.083
or Tok Kasa.

52:18.208 --> 52:18.708
Tok Kasa…?

52:20.666 --> 52:21.916
Could you be... the Hang Kasa?

52:23.375 --> 52:23.875
Yes.

52:24.291 --> 52:24.875
Did you know?

52:25.583 --> 52:27.208
Our commander sent us to find you!

52:27.333 --> 52:28.666
-Huh? Your commander?
-Yeah.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.500
Didn’t Captain Papa tell you anything?

52:31.625 --> 52:33.000
I may have mentioned some stuff,

52:33.291 --> 52:34.458
something about Retak’ka?

52:35.750 --> 52:37.875
But the rest uh... Why don't
you tell him in detail?

52:38.333 --> 52:39.250
Justice needs to eat!

52:40.875 --> 52:41.375
So good.

52:42.166 --> 52:42.791
Papa...

52:43.375 --> 52:45.625
I heard Retak’ka stole some
of your elemental powers.

52:48.750 --> 52:49.416
Yes, Tok.

52:50.375 --> 52:52.750
That must be why my commander
sent me here to find you.

52:54.333 --> 52:55.666
Retak’ka was a student of mine.

52:57.291 --> 52:58.083
I cannot believe...

52:58.625 --> 53:00.375
that baldy has returned to wreak havoc.

53:02.500 --> 53:03.000
Baldy?

53:03.416 --> 53:04.666
Pretty sure he has hair Tok.

53:04.791 --> 53:05.291
Hair?

53:05.708 --> 53:07.083
Wasn’t he a four-legged baldy?

53:08.875 --> 53:09.500
Uh... No, Tok.

53:12.791 --> 53:13.291
My bad!

53:13.791 --> 53:14.916
That’s my horse I’m talking about!

53:17.458 --> 53:19.458
Do you think there is something
wrong with him?

53:20.041 --> 53:21.166
You have to help me, Tok!

53:21.750 --> 53:24.458
Retak’ka, he... he already took four
of my seven Elemental Powers!

53:25.458 --> 53:26.041
Oh, Retak'ka!

53:28.166 --> 53:29.333
The evil elemental master!

53:31.416 --> 53:32.750
You mean, you do know Retak’ka!

53:34.708 --> 53:35.708
I guess you can say that.

53:37.166 --> 53:39.250
If that’s the case... Can
I train under you Tok?

53:40.041 --> 53:40.875
You certainly can.

53:41.791 --> 53:42.458
Thank you, Tok!

53:43.041 --> 53:44.333
Ochobot! Did you hear that?

53:44.875 --> 53:46.041
Tok Kasa agreed to train me.

53:47.041 --> 53:48.541
Huh? Ochobot? Where is Ochobot?

53:50.166 --> 53:52.250
Oh... So Ochobot is the name
of your Power Sphera?

53:55.125 --> 53:56.458
Ochobot! Are you okay Ochobot?

53:57.666 --> 53:58.541
I'm okay, BoBoiBoy.

53:59.458 --> 54:00.000
Don’t worry.

54:00.541 --> 54:02.666
Your Power Sphera is just
running a mild fever.

54:04.875 --> 54:06.583
Wait! Power Spheras can have fevers?

54:07.583 --> 54:08.291
Kids these days.

54:09.458 --> 54:10.958
Always questioning everything.

54:14.958 --> 54:15.750
You’re right, Tok.

54:15.958 --> 54:16.958
He does seem kinda warm.

54:17.375 --> 54:18.208
It must be the weather.

54:18.750 --> 54:19.708
Are you out of your mind?

54:20.625 --> 54:21.583
Robots don't get sick!

54:22.500 --> 54:24.833
These two Power Spheras are
just running low on energy.

54:26.291 --> 54:28.291
I will recharge and get
them back to full power.

54:30.083 --> 54:30.583
Very well.

54:30.833 --> 54:32.083
Let's not waste anymore time.

54:32.583 --> 54:34.291
If what you say about Retak’ka is true...

54:35.416 --> 54:37.125
You need to start training immediately!

54:38.541 --> 54:39.125
Okay, Master!

54:39.208 --> 54:39.791
We are ready!

54:40.416 --> 54:41.250
We begin tomorrow!

54:44.541 --> 54:46.291
Tomorrow? I thought he said immediately.

54:48.333 --> 54:49.041
Keep going, Padu Du!

54:49.583 --> 54:50.958
Hey. That voice seems familiar.

54:53.416 --> 54:54.666
The ex-disciples of Justice!

54:58.291 --> 54:59.708
Oh, so you used to be their master?

55:01.750 --> 55:03.833
What sort of skills have
you passed down to them?

55:04.750 --> 55:05.750
The skill of deduction.

55:06.750 --> 55:07.541
Huh? Deduction?

55:08.875 --> 55:09.958
Indeed. I deduce that...

55:11.250 --> 55:12.875
these two are still lacking in skills!

55:14.625 --> 55:15.833
You are absolutely correct!

55:17.125 --> 55:18.333
Padu Du, Probobo, come here!

55:22.208 --> 55:22.708
Come on.

55:25.416 --> 55:26.083
We're here Tok!

55:26.708 --> 55:28.708
Oh, so this is where you’ve
been hiding Adu Du!

55:28.833 --> 55:29.333
Adu Du?

55:30.583 --> 55:31.208
I’m not Adu Du.

55:31.833 --> 55:33.791
You must have mistaken me
for some other alien.

55:34.291 --> 55:35.250
Uh huh! This is Padu Du,

55:36.375 --> 55:37.083
and I am Probobo!

55:38.541 --> 55:40.541
And who might you two dirty
looking peasants be?

55:42.750 --> 55:44.666
Dude! Stop pretending like
you don't know us!

55:45.875 --> 55:47.291
Yeah! Don’t trust them, Tok!

55:47.875 --> 55:48.916
They’re the bad guys!

55:49.041 --> 55:49.625
The bad guys?

55:50.500 --> 55:52.750
Are you saying, this handsome,
small and petite,

55:53.791 --> 55:55.375
dent-headed green alien is a bad guy?

55:56.750 --> 55:58.583
Hey, hey! There really
is a dent on his head!

55:59.625 --> 56:02.125
Well, that was how I found him
in the forest late last night.

56:09.958 --> 56:11.333
Who’s this little green guy?

56:14.291 --> 56:15.875
Perhaps... he has lost his memories.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.166
Lost his memories?

56:18.291 --> 56:19.083
Yes. Indeed.

56:20.166 --> 56:22.000
The last thing I can remember
was... was...

56:23.833 --> 56:26.041
was seeing my beloved wife
taken away by evil aliens!

56:31.250 --> 56:32.208
Padu Du! My darling!

56:34.666 --> 56:35.166
No!

56:37.458 --> 56:37.958
Ayu Yu!

56:43.208 --> 56:45.583
And that is why I have come here
to train under you master.

56:47.833 --> 56:49.916
I must find a way to save
my beloved wife, Ayu Yu!

56:53.166 --> 56:54.583
Dude! Ayu Yu is not your wife-

56:56.250 --> 56:57.083
That’s admirable!

56:57.625 --> 57:00.041
Wipe your tears, train hard and
good luck oh young Padu Du!

57:01.625 --> 57:03.791
You make sure you get your
beloved wife back ya hear?

57:05.333 --> 57:07.416
-Thank you! I will continue training!
-Let's go!

57:09.208 --> 57:10.500
Good luck Mister Humble Padu Du!

57:10.916 --> 57:11.875
Work it til you make it!

57:13.625 --> 57:15.208
Hey, Captain Papa! What was that for?

57:15.750 --> 57:16.833
Oh, come on. Leave him be.

57:17.666 --> 57:19.958
He deserves to experience happiness
even if it’s false.

57:20.583 --> 57:21.083
Keep going!

57:22.250 --> 57:22.750
Padu Du!

57:23.250 --> 57:24.208
For your wifey, Ayu Yu!

57:25.958 --> 57:27.875
Observe Padu Du and Probobo carefully!

57:29.416 --> 57:31.625
Tomorrow you will be joining
them in their training!

57:33.083 --> 57:33.583
Tok...?

57:33.958 --> 57:35.625
Before we begin our training tomorrow,

57:36.416 --> 57:38.791
is it okay if we contact our
friends and commander first?

57:39.875 --> 57:41.833
Huh? You want to contact
the outside world?

57:42.458 --> 57:44.791
You need a crash course on the
Three Tenets of Training!

57:46.958 --> 57:47.583
Three tenets?

57:48.041 --> 57:48.958
What sort of tenets?

57:49.083 --> 57:49.916
The first tenet!

57:50.666 --> 57:52.791
You must never ever question
my training methods!

57:55.000 --> 57:55.500
No problem, Tok!

57:55.958 --> 57:56.708
Second!

57:57.000 --> 57:58.916
Training will be done
in complete isolation!

57:59.458 --> 58:02.291
Not a single communication device or any
form of technology is allowed!

58:04.666 --> 58:05.250
But why not Tok?

58:05.791 --> 58:07.000
Training requires focus!

58:07.833 --> 58:09.166
How are you supposed to focus...

58:09.250 --> 58:11.208
when you’re distracted
by the outside world?!

58:11.916 --> 58:12.958
Take me for example.

58:13.791 --> 58:16.916
I have reached this level of mastery
because I never relied on technology.

58:19.875 --> 58:20.958
So what's the third tenet?

58:21.083 --> 58:21.916
The third tenet…

58:22.958 --> 58:24.208
The most important one of all!

58:31.750 --> 58:32.250
Wait.

58:32.416 --> 58:33.000
I can’t remember.

58:34.000 --> 58:34.500
Say what...

58:35.541 --> 58:36.666
Was it having a stable income?

58:37.750 --> 58:39.250
No. That tenet is for a housing loan.

58:40.791 --> 58:41.458
Oh aha! I got it!

58:42.541 --> 58:44.250
You are not allowed to go inside my house!

58:45.916 --> 58:46.750
This is a restricted area!

58:47.791 --> 58:49.375
Then where are we supposed to sleep?

58:49.500 --> 58:50.625
Out there, of course.

58:53.416 --> 58:54.416
What kind of a joke is this?!

58:54.958 --> 58:56.666
Justice... never sleeps outside!

58:58.250 --> 59:00.750
Really? But mama always tells you
to sleep on the sofa outside?

59:01.708 --> 59:03.333
Hey! You can't tell people that!

59:03.958 --> 59:04.833
Hey that's a secret.

59:05.791 --> 59:07.250
Enough! Get some rest today.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.416
Tomorrow, you will both begin
your training to defeat...

59:13.125 --> 59:13.875
that Ka’Ta Puntu.

59:15.750 --> 59:16.958
Don’t you mean... Retak’ka?

59:19.416 --> 59:20.291
Oh, yes... Retak’ka...

59:37.125 --> 59:39.083
Are you sure we should be
attacking this place?

59:39.833 --> 59:42.083
This whole area is guarded by
the elite Guruhan Soldiers!

59:44.750 --> 59:46.125
You are scared of a few soldiers?

59:47.541 --> 59:48.458
Of course we are, sir!

59:49.208 --> 59:50.708
They have never once been defeated!

59:56.666 --> 59:58.291
Come out and identify yourselves!

1:00:00.250 --> 1:00:01.250
This is the elite guard?

1:00:02.583 --> 1:00:03.083
Not bad at all...

1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:05.458
Halt! State your intentions!

1:00:06.750 --> 1:00:07.500
Retak’ka Voltra!

1:00:09.416 --> 1:00:10.166
Elemental Drain!

1:00:18.708 --> 1:00:19.208
Attack!

1:00:27.500 --> 1:00:28.000
Come forth.

1:00:31.708 --> 1:00:33.791
We need to go to BoBoiBoy's
location Commander!

1:00:34.458 --> 1:00:35.541
It’s not that simple.

1:00:37.041 --> 1:00:39.541
Planet Quabaq is located deep
within dangerous territory.

1:00:40.708 --> 1:00:42.000
BoBoiBoy is not our priority!

1:00:42.750 --> 1:00:44.083
We need to stop Retak’ka!

1:00:44.208 --> 1:00:45.041
Stop Retak’ka?

1:00:45.958 --> 1:00:47.041
None of you are his match.

1:00:47.666 --> 1:00:48.250
True...

1:00:48.625 --> 1:00:50.833
We were almost destroyed along
with TAPOPS Station.

1:00:51.958 --> 1:00:54.875
If it wasn't for Captain Kaizo's timely
rescue, we wouldn't even be here.

1:01:16.083 --> 1:01:16.791
Energy Barrier!

1:01:43.708 --> 1:01:46.833
Captain Kaizo also managed to plant a
tracker on Retak'ka's spaceship.

1:01:48.041 --> 1:01:49.375
Let us wait for his report!

1:01:58.208 --> 1:01:59.041
What happened here?

1:02:00.500 --> 1:02:01.625
This is impossible!

1:02:07.333 --> 1:02:08.083
Admiral! Commander!

1:02:09.083 --> 1:02:11.541
The Guruhan Soldiers from Planet
Gur'Latan have been defeated!

1:02:11.666 --> 1:02:12.250
What?!

1:02:12.375 --> 1:02:13.375
Defeated? How many?

1:02:14.416 --> 1:02:15.916
It seems like... All of them...

1:02:17.958 --> 1:02:18.541
All of them…?

1:02:20.333 --> 1:02:22.541
The current situation is more
dire than we expected!

1:02:23.291 --> 1:02:24.666
But why Planet Gur’Latan?

1:02:25.291 --> 1:02:26.583
Where is his location now?

1:02:27.958 --> 1:02:29.666
They are currently in
Sector G159A Nusagima!

1:02:31.250 --> 1:02:32.458
What's in that sector?!

1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:36.083
The sector has no known inhabited
planets except…

1:02:37.083 --> 1:02:37.583
Planet Bayugan!

1:02:40.166 --> 1:02:41.750
What would he want with that planet?/

1:02:42.208 --> 1:02:42.708
Oh! I know!

1:02:43.833 --> 1:02:44.666
What is it, Yaya?

1:02:44.791 --> 1:02:47.416
Retak'ka wants the elemental
powers from the planet!

1:02:47.500 --> 1:02:48.125
Look at this!

1:02:52.208 --> 1:02:53.833
Planet Gur’latan is full
of electrical energy!

1:02:54.375 --> 1:02:56.583
And Planet Bayugan is known
as a stormy planet!

1:02:57.958 --> 1:03:01.125
He’s going to these two planets to
enhance the elemental powers within him!

1:03:02.333 --> 1:03:03.833
Looks like, Planet Bayugan is in danger!

1:03:04.833 --> 1:03:06.333
Send a warning signal to them immediately!

1:03:06.458 --> 1:03:07.458
On it, Commander!

1:03:22.333 --> 1:03:23.041
I'm so sleepy...

1:03:24.708 --> 1:03:26.208
Why are you all bundled up, Tok?

1:03:27.708 --> 1:03:28.541
Oh, didn't I mention it?

1:03:31.125 --> 1:03:31.625
On this planet,

1:03:32.208 --> 1:03:34.083
cold icy winds can blow
in the blink of an eye.

1:03:35.208 --> 1:03:35.958
Blink of an eye?

1:03:36.791 --> 1:03:38.083
Nothing's happening-

1:03:46.583 --> 1:03:47.291
BoBoiBoy Blaze!

1:03:53.666 --> 1:03:56.000
You're just lucky you still
have your fire elemental.

1:03:56.750 --> 1:03:57.916
Trainees came unprepared.

1:03:58.291 --> 1:03:59.000
Points deducted!

1:03:59.541 --> 1:04:01.083
Hey! Who are you to deduct our points?

1:04:03.208 --> 1:04:04.375
Introducing my assistant,

1:04:04.791 --> 1:04:05.958
tiny and bright, Pipi Zola!

1:04:07.625 --> 1:04:08.125
What?

1:04:08.625 --> 1:04:09.833
How can you call Papa tiny, Tok?

1:04:11.166 --> 1:04:12.625
Oh woe. That was really uncalled for.

1:04:14.458 --> 1:04:15.291
Now then!

1:04:15.583 --> 1:04:18.166
Are you two ready to face Tok Kasa's
ultimate basic training?

1:04:19.958 --> 1:04:20.458
Ready!

1:04:21.083 --> 1:04:21.958
Coming through....

1:04:22.833 --> 1:04:23.333
Excuse us.

1:04:24.875 --> 1:04:26.375
What are you guys tiptoeing around for?

1:04:26.875 --> 1:04:28.666
Shhh! Quiet you rookie.

1:04:29.208 --> 1:04:30.666
Aha! That's the tree, Master Padu Du.

1:04:33.750 --> 1:04:35.416
I didn't notice that tree there before.

1:04:36.375 --> 1:04:38.375
That right there is your first training!

1:04:38.500 --> 1:04:39.666
The Accuracy Training!

1:04:40.416 --> 1:04:41.916
You must shoot the fruit
on top of that tree!

1:04:43.333 --> 1:04:44.250
On that tree?

1:04:44.375 --> 1:04:45.125
Shhh!

1:04:46.250 --> 1:04:46.916
Aw come on! Just shoot!

1:04:47.750 --> 1:04:48.916
It's not like the tree can dodge.

1:04:51.041 --> 1:04:51.541
What?!

1:04:52.083 --> 1:04:53.416
That tree actually dodged?!

1:05:00.541 --> 1:05:01.916
What kind of tree is that?!

1:05:02.708 --> 1:05:04.041
This is the tree we call Bak Bak.

1:05:04.583 --> 1:05:05.958
It must be struck, struck.

1:05:07.208 --> 1:05:08.000
BoBoiBoy Ice!

1:05:10.375 --> 1:05:10.875
Ice Cannon!

1:05:14.333 --> 1:05:15.458
Food Transformation Blast!

1:05:31.166 --> 1:05:31.666
I missed?!

1:05:33.125 --> 1:05:34.666
What is the use of strength
without accuracy?

1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:37.125
Ooh that was deep.

1:05:38.208 --> 1:05:38.958
Hashtag too deep.

1:05:40.250 --> 1:05:41.375
Chase it Probobo!

1:05:41.500 --> 1:05:43.166
-After it!
-On it, Master Padu Du!

1:05:43.916 --> 1:05:45.833
-Hey, don't run, tree!
-No wonder you missed!

1:05:46.541 --> 1:05:48.125
You must first fix your horse stance!

1:05:50.125 --> 1:05:51.500
-What horse stance?
-Just do it!

1:05:53.250 --> 1:05:54.333
What kind of horse stance is that?

1:05:54.875 --> 1:05:55.833
This is a horse stance!

1:06:01.625 --> 1:06:02.416
Are you for real?!

1:06:02.958 --> 1:06:04.291
This is a hungry horse! Now you do it!

1:06:05.583 --> 1:06:06.625
Don't forget the sound too!

1:06:11.708 --> 1:06:12.208
Yes! Well done!

1:06:12.875 --> 1:06:13.750
Now use your Ice Bow.

1:06:17.416 --> 1:06:17.916
Woah...

1:06:23.875 --> 1:06:25.583
Now then. Try to shoot down these plates.

1:06:27.083 --> 1:06:27.666
Here!

1:06:35.333 --> 1:06:36.291
I... I wasn't ready, Tok!

1:06:37.750 --> 1:06:39.208
Did you think I would go easy on you?

1:06:40.625 --> 1:06:41.125
Step aside.

1:06:41.541 --> 1:06:42.458
I'll show you how it's done.

1:06:43.041 --> 1:06:43.541
Here, Tok.

1:06:43.666 --> 1:06:44.583
Come at me!

1:06:44.708 --> 1:06:45.208
Ok. Ready?

1:06:47.125 --> 1:06:47.625
Ready!

1:06:48.791 --> 1:06:50.166
Watch and learn, BoBoiBoy.

1:06:50.291 --> 1:06:51.208
Here! Shoot!

1:06:58.250 --> 1:06:59.750
Failure due to a stomachache.

1:07:00.541 --> 1:07:01.625
What did you eat, horsey?

1:07:03.666 --> 1:07:04.750
Horsey ate a whole plate!

1:07:08.541 --> 1:07:09.166
That’s not funny!

1:07:09.750 --> 1:07:10.916
Next training, please...!

1:07:12.875 --> 1:07:15.583
The second training course is
called the agility training.

1:07:17.125 --> 1:07:19.750
You must venture into the cavernous
lair of the Kang Kong.

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:23.166
They are a pack of dangerous
and vicious creatures.

1:07:24.541 --> 1:07:25.916
They move slowly in the light...

1:07:26.708 --> 1:07:29.083
However in darkness, they move
at extremely high speed.

1:07:35.333 --> 1:07:38.208
Be wary as you approach the tallest
rock formation within the cave!

1:07:40.708 --> 1:07:42.125
Therein lies that which you seek.

1:07:45.541 --> 1:07:47.083
What are we seeking again, BoBoiBoy?

1:07:47.625 --> 1:07:49.541
What you seek is the leader
of the Kang Kongs,

1:07:50.541 --> 1:07:51.833
also known as, King Kang Kong.

1:07:54.666 --> 1:07:57.041
Your task is to obtain a strand of
hair from the top of the head of,

1:07:59.625 --> 1:08:00.125
King Kang Kong!

1:08:00.916 --> 1:08:02.250
Shh! Tok! Not so loud please!

1:08:03.750 --> 1:08:05.041
Oops. I'll get going then.

1:08:05.750 --> 1:08:07.083
King Kang Kong's just up ahead.

1:08:07.750 --> 1:08:08.583
Say hi to him for me.

1:08:09.750 --> 1:08:10.291
Tata titi tutu.

1:08:15.166 --> 1:08:16.208
Watch your step, Gopal.

1:08:16.500 --> 1:08:17.833
They're very fast in the dark.

1:08:21.416 --> 1:08:22.000
He's so huge!

1:08:34.833 --> 1:08:35.500
Come on, Gopal!

1:08:36.541 --> 1:08:38.583
How did I get myself dragged
into your training...

1:08:41.958 --> 1:08:42.458
He's bald?!

1:08:44.416 --> 1:08:45.666
Shh! Keep it down, Gopal!

1:08:47.375 --> 1:08:49.250
Dude. How are we supposed to
pluck his hair if he's bald?

1:09:01.625 --> 1:09:02.500
Watch out, Gopal!

1:09:12.041 --> 1:09:12.541
Run, Gopal!

1:09:22.333 --> 1:09:23.791
Yikes! The other Kang Kongs are awake!

1:09:39.625 --> 1:09:40.958
Please don't eat me, Mr. Baldy!

1:09:47.583 --> 1:09:49.291
We have to dash across
using the light rays!

1:09:49.708 --> 1:09:52.041
Hey! How's your training going
down there my students?

1:09:54.375 --> 1:09:54.875
Captain Papa?

1:09:56.416 --> 1:09:57.875
Move! Don't block the light holes!

1:09:59.000 --> 1:09:59.500
Get back, Papa!

1:10:00.083 --> 1:10:01.500
The Kang Kongs will speed up!

1:10:02.791 --> 1:10:04.333
Oh, thank you for reminding me, Pipi.

1:10:06.208 --> 1:10:07.458
Good thing Justice has you!

1:10:08.583 --> 1:10:10.000
But but... I can't stand it!

1:10:11.208 --> 1:10:12.375
I wanna know what's going on!

1:10:12.916 --> 1:10:13.750
Let's get closer.

1:10:14.416 --> 1:10:15.375
What a brilliant idea!

1:10:15.958 --> 1:10:17.291
Are you guys okay down there?

1:10:17.916 --> 1:10:20.333
What's happening? What's happening?
What's happening?

1:10:24.416 --> 1:10:25.791
Run! Don't just stay in the dark!

1:10:27.083 --> 1:10:28.083
Hey, hey! Run, run!

1:10:28.666 --> 1:10:29.166
Get away!

1:10:59.791 --> 1:11:00.291
Strange.

1:11:01.458 --> 1:11:03.208
Someone just sent us BoBoiBoy's location.

1:11:05.375 --> 1:11:06.375
We have arrived at Rimbara.

1:11:15.291 --> 1:11:16.041
I'm so exhausted.

1:11:19.208 --> 1:11:20.375
See, what did I tell you?

1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:22.583
Don't stay in the dark.

1:11:23.333 --> 1:11:23.916
Did you listen?

1:11:24.916 --> 1:11:25.416
No.

1:11:29.666 --> 1:11:31.541
So! How did your second
training session go?

1:11:33.833 --> 1:11:34.416
They failed, Tok.

1:11:35.416 --> 1:11:36.125
What? Failed again?

1:11:37.708 --> 1:11:38.791
Of course we failed, Tok!

1:11:39.250 --> 1:11:42.166
How are we supposed to pluck King Kang
Kong's hair when he’s bald?!

1:11:42.291 --> 1:11:43.041
I guess...

1:11:44.208 --> 1:11:45.375
That's not my problem.

1:11:50.083 --> 1:11:52.958
I must thank you, for sending the
warning to our people in advance.

1:11:55.541 --> 1:11:57.500
Retak'ka truly did come
and attack our planet.

1:12:00.791 --> 1:12:02.875
Thanks to Yaya the people
of Rimbara are safe.

1:12:03.458 --> 1:12:05.916
How is the evacuation process
on Planet Rimbara going?

1:12:06.958 --> 1:12:07.708
It's going very well.

1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:09.500
There is only one village left.

1:12:10.166 --> 1:12:10.666
Good.

1:12:14.083 --> 1:12:15.708
Retak'ka's spaceship has been detected!

1:12:15.833 --> 1:12:16.666
What?!

1:12:17.166 --> 1:12:17.916
Prepare ArmoBot!

1:12:29.416 --> 1:12:30.166
Here, here! Quick!

1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:31.291
Inside, inside!

1:12:35.125 --> 1:12:37.000
This is the last group. Prepare to depart!

1:12:40.041 --> 1:12:41.500
Make haste! Retak'ka is here!

1:12:42.208 --> 1:12:42.708
What?!

1:12:47.916 --> 1:12:50.083
Cendaham, Cendasya, Cendamar,
Cendapia, Cendalal,

1:12:50.791 --> 1:12:52.583
Cendadam, Cendarin, Cendayad, Cendaqif.

1:12:53.166 --> 1:12:54.166
Where is Cendamad?!

1:12:54.916 --> 1:12:56.083
Cendamad's left behind!

1:12:56.666 --> 1:12:57.291
Roar! Roar! Roar!

1:13:02.833 --> 1:13:04.916
-Cendamad! Cendamad!
-Where are you?!

1:13:06.916 --> 1:13:07.416
Cendamad!

1:13:08.250 --> 1:13:09.750
-Little Cendamad!
-Cendamad!

1:13:11.833 --> 1:13:12.375
Over there!

1:13:13.041 --> 1:13:13.541
Go and get him, Ying!

1:13:20.625 --> 1:13:23.250
How peculiar. And here I thought
you had all been destroyed!

1:13:27.375 --> 1:13:28.291
Come with me, Cendamad!

1:13:30.458 --> 1:13:31.208
Retak'ka Voltra!

1:13:34.208 --> 1:13:35.375
You think you can outrun me?

1:13:37.250 --> 1:13:39.125
-Gravity Punch!
-Shadow Gorilla Punch!

1:13:52.833 --> 1:13:53.791
You will regeret that.

1:13:55.291 --> 1:13:56.000
Retak'ka Darkwood!

1:14:04.666 --> 1:14:05.666
Get inside Cendamad!

1:14:06.208 --> 1:14:07.541
-Mama!
-Cendamad, my boy!

1:14:11.041 --> 1:14:11.541
Let's move!

1:14:33.083 --> 1:14:34.541
He's absorbing the Elemental Power!

1:14:35.458 --> 1:14:36.750
You have to go, Commander!

1:14:36.875 --> 1:14:38.583
It’s too dangerous for you to stay here!

1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:40.083
But...!

1:14:40.166 --> 1:14:42.125
Don't worry! We'll defend
the spaceship from below!

1:14:43.041 --> 1:14:43.541
Very well!

1:14:46.125 --> 1:14:47.416
Where are you're going?!

1:14:50.416 --> 1:14:51.125
Slo-Mo Power!

1:14:53.750 --> 1:14:54.666
Deploy ArmoBot!

1:14:55.875 --> 1:14:57.083
Right away, Admiral!

1:15:14.166 --> 1:15:15.375
ArmoBot has been deployed!

1:15:15.958 --> 1:15:16.625
Let's move out!

1:15:25.708 --> 1:15:26.333
Let’s do this!

1:15:34.541 --> 1:15:35.541
Why do I get just horns?!

1:15:36.375 --> 1:15:37.625
What am I supposed to do with them?

1:15:39.083 --> 1:15:39.666
New arsenal?

1:15:40.750 --> 1:15:42.666
I will shatter them along
with their owners!

1:15:46.041 --> 1:15:47.250
Gravity... Blitz... Smash!

1:15:59.791 --> 1:16:00.416
Take this!

1:16:07.416 --> 1:16:08.125
Supersonic Kick!

1:16:13.333 --> 1:16:13.916
How dare you-

1:16:14.458 --> 1:16:15.125
Gravity Punch!

1:16:22.958 --> 1:16:23.666
How irritating!

1:16:31.125 --> 1:16:31.708
My hand is stuck!

1:16:36.666 --> 1:16:38.000
Shadow Buffalo Hybrid Attack!

1:16:49.291 --> 1:16:50.375
This horn ain't half bad.

1:16:55.875 --> 1:16:56.791
Get over here you brat!

1:17:10.208 --> 1:17:12.375
When will we ever complete
our training, BoBoiBoy?

1:17:14.791 --> 1:17:15.333
Beats me...

1:17:18.291 --> 1:17:20.708
No matter how many times we try,
we keep failing the tests.

1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:23.666
Hey dude! Were you even listening to me?

1:17:25.166 --> 1:17:25.666
Sorry...

1:17:26.416 --> 1:17:28.291
I was just thinking about
Yaya, Ying and Fang.

1:17:28.875 --> 1:17:30.041
Why are you worried about them?

1:17:30.625 --> 1:17:32.583
You should worry about
our training instead.

1:17:32.750 --> 1:17:34.166
Because if we worry about them...

1:17:35.375 --> 1:17:36.500
we’ll start missing them!

1:17:37.125 --> 1:17:37.791
I wanna go home!

1:17:38.750 --> 1:17:39.625
I wanna go home, BoBoiBoy!

1:17:40.625 --> 1:17:42.375
I wanna go home too, Gopal!
I wanna go home!

1:17:49.500 --> 1:17:50.916
Let's get our training done BoBoiBoy!

1:17:51.041 --> 1:17:53.916
The sooner we complete it, the
sooner we can go back home!

1:17:55.958 --> 1:17:56.458
Let's do it!

1:18:02.208 --> 1:18:03.833
Sometimes I wanna be like everybody

1:18:05.041 --> 1:18:06.666
But there are times I wanna be somebody

1:18:08.041 --> 1:18:08.833
Wanna be a champion

1:18:10.833 --> 1:18:11.541
Gonna make it happen

1:18:12.833 --> 1:18:14.750
They say you gotta live
your life with virtue

1:18:15.583 --> 1:18:17.625
Cause we’re only really
just passing through

1:18:18.291 --> 1:18:19.708
Yeah face it and find your courage

1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:21.500
You gotta believe it

1:18:22.875 --> 1:18:24.416
So I try and I try, no I’m not giving in

1:18:25.791 --> 1:18:27.125
Chasing that flickering light

1:18:28.125 --> 1:18:29.500
So I try and I try, no I’m not giving in

1:18:31.125 --> 1:18:32.416
Reaching that place out of sight

1:18:33.333 --> 1:18:34.041
I’m fire, and I’m water

1:18:36.208 --> 1:18:37.125
You have given me the power

1:18:38.583 --> 1:18:39.708
I’m earth, and I’m nature

1:18:41.125 --> 1:18:42.333
Yeah you got me feelin’ like

1:18:43.666 --> 1:18:44.250
I’m rising up

1:18:44.875 --> 1:18:45.416
I feel it now

1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:47.041
I’ll never let you down

1:18:48.708 --> 1:18:49.291
I’m rising up

1:18:49.958 --> 1:18:50.458
I feel it now

1:18:51.416 --> 1:18:52.250
I’ll keep you safe and sound

1:18:54.208 --> 1:18:55.333
I’ll give my all to face it all

1:18:56.500 --> 1:18:57.541
Together we can take it all

1:18:59.208 --> 1:18:59.708
Woah oh!

1:19:01.583 --> 1:19:02.291
Woah oh!

1:19:04.250 --> 1:19:05.125
I’m fire and I’m water

1:19:07.125 --> 1:19:08.291
You have given me the power

1:19:09.625 --> 1:19:10.791
I’m earth and I’m nature

1:19:12.333 --> 1:19:13.833
Yeah you got me feelin’ like (yeah!)

1:19:14.916 --> 1:19:15.833
I’m fire, and I’m water

1:19:17.583 --> 1:19:18.500
You have given me the power

1:19:19.916 --> 1:19:21.041
I’m earth, and I’m nature

1:19:22.416 --> 1:19:23.875
Yeah you got me feelin’ like (oh!)

1:19:30.458 --> 1:19:31.375
Boy oh boy oh boy oh boy

1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:34.416
Don’t go down without a fight (oh!)

1:19:36.750 --> 1:19:37.708
I’m fire, and I’m water

1:19:45.125 --> 1:19:46.750
Why do we keep coming back to this cave?

1:19:47.250 --> 1:19:49.125
It’s not like he's going
to grow hair so soon.

1:19:51.250 --> 1:19:53.416
Well you never know... It
might just suddenly grow.

1:19:54.958 --> 1:19:56.291
I know one thing for sure.

1:19:56.541 --> 1:19:58.125
Every time, we keep on failing
again and again.

1:19:59.791 --> 1:20:01.208
And how do you know you've failed?

1:20:02.416 --> 1:20:04.666
What? You’re the one who keeps
telling us we fail every time.

1:20:05.625 --> 1:20:06.125
Fail! Fail!

1:20:07.416 --> 1:20:07.916
Fail again!

1:20:08.791 --> 1:20:09.291
An utter failure!

1:20:11.375 --> 1:20:11.875
-Pa-
-Pa-?!

1:20:12.916 --> 1:20:13.416
Did we pass?!

1:20:14.166 --> 1:20:14.666
Pathetic!

1:20:16.208 --> 1:20:16.708
You see?

1:20:17.125 --> 1:20:18.041
Don't tell me you forgot.

1:20:18.625 --> 1:20:19.791
This is what you don't understand.

1:20:21.166 --> 1:20:22.875
You may have failed the training course.

1:20:24.166 --> 1:20:26.166
But the training course has
not failed in training you.

1:20:29.500 --> 1:20:30.416
What do you mean, Tok?

1:20:30.750 --> 1:20:31.375
I don't get it.

1:20:31.916 --> 1:20:33.875
Yeah. You mean we failed
in failing our failure?

1:20:36.291 --> 1:20:37.041
Observe closely.

1:20:46.416 --> 1:20:47.166
What gives, Tok?!

1:20:47.458 --> 1:20:48.541
Why’d you suddenly attack us?

1:20:49.125 --> 1:20:49.916
Do you not realize it?

1:20:51.958 --> 1:20:52.666
I... I get it now!

1:20:54.041 --> 1:20:55.833
Tok has way too many dishes for a hermit!

1:20:57.625 --> 1:20:58.125
That's not it!

1:20:58.875 --> 1:21:00.083
We... We're a lot faster now!

1:21:00.916 --> 1:21:01.958
Yes. So you do get it.

1:21:02.958 --> 1:21:04.083
Do you understand now?

1:21:04.666 --> 1:21:05.166
I do, Tok!

1:21:05.583 --> 1:21:07.291
Our agility and accuracy has increased!

1:21:08.333 --> 1:21:10.000
That was the real point of the training!

1:21:10.125 --> 1:21:10.833
Indeed.

1:21:11.791 --> 1:21:12.791
Now for the real test...

1:21:13.375 --> 1:21:16.583
Let us see if you are fast and accurate
enough to seize this crystal from me!

1:21:19.416 --> 1:21:19.916
You’ve got it.

1:21:20.500 --> 1:21:23.041
If you succeed, I will consider
your whole training complete.

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:27.416
Our training will be complete?!

1:21:27.625 --> 1:21:28.166
Come on, Gopal!

1:21:29.875 --> 1:21:30.875
But I still don't get it.

1:21:31.375 --> 1:21:32.958
Our failure... failed to... fail us?

1:21:34.083 --> 1:21:35.666
You just sit there until you get it.

1:21:37.125 --> 1:21:37.625
Awesome...

1:21:38.583 --> 1:21:39.583
BoBoiBoy Triple Split!

1:21:49.125 --> 1:21:49.750
Good day, Tok!

1:21:51.166 --> 1:21:52.708
I've prepared my report for you!

1:21:53.416 --> 1:21:54.750
I really can't wait to show you!

1:21:56.875 --> 1:21:58.125
Doesn't look like anybody's home.

1:22:06.625 --> 1:22:07.791
Hey! Don’t enter the house!

1:22:08.166 --> 1:22:09.208
This is restricted area!

1:22:09.958 --> 1:22:11.833
I thought he said he doesn't
use technology,

1:22:12.500 --> 1:22:14.458
but his house is filled
with all these gadgets.

1:22:15.291 --> 1:22:16.125
Hey, you're right.

1:22:16.791 --> 1:22:18.125
He even has an electric guitar.

1:22:21.791 --> 1:22:22.625
Welcome home, Tok Kasa.

1:22:23.750 --> 1:22:24.250
What?

1:22:24.375 --> 1:22:26.250
Your favourite iced milk
tea, with cream on top.

1:22:27.250 --> 1:22:28.833
One hundred twenty five calories.

1:22:30.208 --> 1:22:30.708
Voila!

1:22:32.708 --> 1:22:33.708
He even has a ButlerBot!

1:22:38.208 --> 1:22:39.291
Where do these stairs go?

1:22:45.541 --> 1:22:47.541
Three against one and you
are still struggling?

1:22:48.791 --> 1:22:49.375
Flaming Breath!

1:22:53.916 --> 1:22:54.875
That’s really hot!

1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:55.833
Earth Golem!

1:22:58.666 --> 1:22:59.166
Take this!

1:23:12.083 --> 1:23:13.333
He is definitely a lot faster...

1:23:14.458 --> 1:23:14.958
Gopal?!

1:23:15.125 --> 1:23:15.625
Hi Tok!

1:23:15.750 --> 1:23:17.333
Cookie Crumble Transformation!

1:23:22.708 --> 1:23:23.541
My crystal!

1:23:24.583 --> 1:23:25.083
No!

1:23:26.291 --> 1:23:27.750
Grab the crystal now, BoBoiBoy!

1:23:44.291 --> 1:23:45.083
I didn't get it...?

1:23:49.208 --> 1:23:49.791
Huh! I got it!

1:23:50.500 --> 1:23:51.000
We did it!

1:23:53.750 --> 1:23:54.250
Way to go, BoBoiBoy!

1:23:55.250 --> 1:23:56.333
That was awesome, Gopal!

1:23:57.666 --> 1:23:58.166
How's that?

1:23:58.500 --> 1:23:59.916
You didn't see that coming, did ya?

1:24:01.166 --> 1:24:03.041
You sure had me fooled
with your act earlier.

1:24:05.250 --> 1:24:05.750
So, Tok.

1:24:06.583 --> 1:24:07.208
This means...

1:24:07.750 --> 1:24:09.250
we passed all of our training right?

1:24:10.375 --> 1:24:10.875
Yes...

1:24:12.166 --> 1:24:13.083
Congrats! Congrats!

1:24:13.916 --> 1:24:15.250
You two have passed indeed!

1:24:16.375 --> 1:24:16.875
And now...

1:24:18.416 --> 1:24:20.125
Time for you to pay your training fees...

1:24:21.541 --> 1:24:23.375
-Huh? Training fees?
-Of course.

1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:26.958
Did you think all this
training was for free?

1:24:27.666 --> 1:24:29.500
But, we don't have any
money to pay you with.

1:24:31.666 --> 1:24:32.958
All I’ve got is, one dollar.

1:24:34.833 --> 1:24:36.125
What would I want Earth money for?

1:24:36.666 --> 1:24:37.625
I can't use it here.

1:24:38.500 --> 1:24:39.250
BoBoiBoy! Gopal!

1:24:40.541 --> 1:24:41.416
Disciples of Justice!

1:24:43.666 --> 1:24:44.875
What’s up with Captain Papa?

1:24:46.083 --> 1:24:48.041
So then... How should we
pay for your fees, Tok?

1:24:49.208 --> 1:24:50.166
Oh, don't worry.

1:24:51.208 --> 1:24:52.041
You can pay me like this!

1:24:56.458 --> 1:24:57.333
What’s going on, Tok?!

1:24:59.000 --> 1:24:59.500
Let me go!

1:25:03.375 --> 1:25:05.250
I will be taking your
quake elemental power!

1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:10.500
No!

1:25:17.458 --> 1:25:18.750
My... My Quake Power is gone...

1:25:20.666 --> 1:25:21.791
But... but why, Tok?

1:25:23.708 --> 1:25:24.958
Because... Tok Kasa is a liar!

1:25:27.541 --> 1:25:28.041
A liar?

1:25:28.375 --> 1:25:30.041
That's right! Here. Look at this!

1:25:30.916 --> 1:25:31.833
Huh?! Ochobot?

1:25:32.916 --> 1:25:33.500
BoBoiBoy...

1:25:34.791 --> 1:25:37.750
We found Ochobot all hooked up to the
machines in Tok Kasa's house!

1:25:39.291 --> 1:25:39.833
Poor Ochobot.

1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:41.500
What?

1:25:42.958 --> 1:25:44.458
Hey! Are you even listening?!

1:25:45.583 --> 1:25:46.208
Get out!

1:25:49.041 --> 1:25:49.875
What is this place?

1:25:51.375 --> 1:25:52.083
That's Ochobot!

1:25:53.666 --> 1:25:54.416
Forgive me, Tok Kasa.

1:25:54.750 --> 1:25:56.625
I tried to stop them from trespassing
into your house.

1:25:57.791 --> 1:25:58.916
But they refused to listen!

1:25:59.458 --> 1:26:01.125
Who are... who are you really, Tok?!

1:26:02.250 --> 1:26:02.750
I am...

1:26:03.750 --> 1:26:05.625
the original user of the
Crystal Elemental!

1:26:08.208 --> 1:26:09.083
Crystal Elemental?

1:26:09.708 --> 1:26:10.208
Yes.

1:26:10.875 --> 1:26:12.958
The third Elemental level
after Earth and Quake.

1:26:15.375 --> 1:26:16.708
We've been tricked, BoBoiBoy!

1:26:16.958 --> 1:26:18.166
Oh? I didn't trick you at all.

1:26:19.500 --> 1:26:20.083
Look at this.

1:26:20.375 --> 1:26:21.375
Hey, hey! Give him back!

1:26:22.625 --> 1:26:23.125
BoBoiBoy!

1:26:23.541 --> 1:26:25.000
Run away and head to Planet Quabaq!

1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.250
Huh?! Wasn't the data from
the Commander corrupted?!

1:26:29.583 --> 1:26:30.833
Tok Kasa fixed my data bank...

1:26:32.333 --> 1:26:33.083
This is Hang Kasa.

1:26:33.750 --> 1:26:36.000
You must find him and find out
a way to defeat Retak'ka.

1:26:37.958 --> 1:26:38.583
Commander...

1:26:39.166 --> 1:26:41.000
Commander never told us
to train under him!

1:26:41.833 --> 1:26:42.708
According to intel,

1:26:43.208 --> 1:26:44.791
Hang Kasa was Retak'ka's old friend.

1:26:46.500 --> 1:26:47.583
Retak'ka's old friend?!

1:26:48.041 --> 1:26:49.000
How is that possible?!

1:26:49.500 --> 1:26:50.375
It's a long story...

1:26:51.541 --> 1:26:52.125
Tell us, Tok.

1:26:54.958 --> 1:26:55.916
A very long time ago...

1:26:57.791 --> 1:26:59.958
I met Retak'ka on the desolate
planet named Gugura.

1:27:01.500 --> 1:27:03.375
The dumping ground for
all things unwanted.

1:27:04.875 --> 1:27:05.833
Such as Retak'ka and I.

1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:08.875
Please, Tok Kasa...

1:27:09.916 --> 1:27:11.166
Can you please cut this short?

1:27:11.458 --> 1:27:12.166
Oh... Of course.

1:27:13.791 --> 1:27:15.291
Retak'ka and I were best of friends.

1:27:16.208 --> 1:27:17.833
He found the Power Sphera Light Gamma,

1:27:18.500 --> 1:27:20.166
I found the Power Sphera Quake Crystal.

1:27:21.041 --> 1:27:22.666
But as we grew older, he became greedy.

1:27:23.833 --> 1:27:25.416
He stole five more Elemental Powers!

1:27:26.333 --> 1:27:27.708
And then, he came after my power.

1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:30.541
How could he? What do you think? Huh?!

1:27:30.625 --> 1:27:31.583
No, he shouldn't have!

1:27:32.416 --> 1:27:33.750
And that is why I had to stop him.

1:27:35.333 --> 1:27:37.000
I used a special Power Sphera, Ochobot,

1:27:37.958 --> 1:27:39.875
to drain all of Retak'ka's
Elemental Powers.

1:27:41.750 --> 1:27:42.875
So... you do know Ochobot?

1:27:44.125 --> 1:27:45.250
Is Ochobot your grandson?

1:27:46.791 --> 1:27:48.166
-It's a long story.
-Shorten it.

1:27:48.833 --> 1:27:49.333
No!

1:27:50.833 --> 1:27:51.666
Tok Kasa! Tok Kasa!

1:27:52.083 --> 1:27:53.500
You have a message from Retak'ka.

1:27:54.291 --> 1:27:54.791
Retak'ka?!

1:27:58.875 --> 1:28:00.583
Imagine my surprise to find you alive...

1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:03.166
You have not changed at all.

1:28:03.958 --> 1:28:05.208
Still cunning and deceptive!

1:28:06.541 --> 1:28:07.958
Did you think I would not find out?

1:28:08.958 --> 1:28:11.041
It was you who sent me the
location of those brats!

1:28:12.125 --> 1:28:13.541
Tok Kasa used us to bait Retak'ka!

1:28:15.250 --> 1:28:17.458
I will not go to Quabaq and
fall for your obvious trap.

1:28:19.583 --> 1:28:20.916
If you really wish to stop me...

1:28:21.875 --> 1:28:23.083
you must come to this planet.

1:28:27.083 --> 1:28:27.583
Earth?

1:28:28.166 --> 1:28:29.500
He's heading to Planet Earth?!

1:28:33.041 --> 1:28:34.625
If it wasn’t for these pathetic kids,

1:28:36.416 --> 1:28:37.166
Fang! Ying! Yaya!

1:28:38.583 --> 1:28:41.791
I wouldn’t have learned about this planet
that contains all seven elements.

1:28:44.083 --> 1:28:44.958
I will see you there.

1:28:49.041 --> 1:28:49.666
Let me go, Tok!

1:28:50.458 --> 1:28:51.833
I have to go back to Planet Earth!

1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:55.458
Why are you spacing out, Tok Kasa?!

1:28:57.333 --> 1:28:57.833
Was that...

1:28:58.166 --> 1:28:58.916
really Retak'ka?

1:29:00.291 --> 1:29:00.958
Of course, Tok.

1:29:01.458 --> 1:29:02.083
What's wrong?

1:29:02.291 --> 1:29:03.708
You don't recognize your own BFF?

1:29:04.875 --> 1:29:06.125
But why does he look the same?!

1:29:06.875 --> 1:29:08.125
He should be much older by now.

1:29:10.416 --> 1:29:12.583
Oh, man... My crystals must
have kept him youthful.

1:29:13.333 --> 1:29:14.750
How am I supposed to fight him now?

1:29:15.083 --> 1:29:16.583
I didn't expect to fight a young man.

1:29:17.333 --> 1:29:18.541
Huh? What are you doing Papa?

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:20.708
Well. What else?

1:29:21.791 --> 1:29:22.291
Justice...

1:29:22.791 --> 1:29:24.125
also wants the elixir of youth!

1:29:52.166 --> 1:29:52.666
It seems...

1:29:53.583 --> 1:29:55.666
I have no choice but to use
my greatest technique.

1:30:03.500 --> 1:30:04.166
Show yourself.

1:30:07.208 --> 1:30:09.041
Hello there. Are you looking
for Hang Kasa?

1:30:09.750 --> 1:30:10.583
Who is that old guy?

1:30:11.958 --> 1:30:13.625
Apologies. Hang Kasa couldn't make it.

1:30:14.958 --> 1:30:15.958
He’s got a stomachache.

1:30:19.500 --> 1:30:20.875
What kind of a lame joke is that?!

1:30:21.375 --> 1:30:23.125
You mean that's his greatest technique?!

1:30:23.875 --> 1:30:25.791
Uh... Do you see Yaya,
Ying and Fang anywhere?

1:30:29.041 --> 1:30:29.541
I see them!

1:30:30.041 --> 1:30:31.375
They're inside the spaceship!

1:30:32.750 --> 1:30:33.833
Must be something he ate.

1:30:34.500 --> 1:30:36.125
That's why he sent me here in his place.

1:30:44.083 --> 1:30:46.500
Did you really think I would not
recognize you, Hang Kasa?

1:30:47.916 --> 1:30:48.583
Hey, calm down.

1:30:49.458 --> 1:30:50.833
I haven't seen you in a long time.

1:30:51.666 --> 1:30:52.333
What's up, bro?

1:30:52.958 --> 1:30:53.833
Do not waste my time!

1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:56.416
Hand over that boy and your power!

1:31:03.041 --> 1:31:04.500
Oh... So you want to play rough huh?

1:31:06.583 --> 1:31:07.083
Very well!

1:31:07.666 --> 1:31:08.666
Behold... KristalBot!

1:31:11.625 --> 1:31:12.333
A Power Sphera?!

1:31:13.250 --> 1:31:15.958
Time for me to put an end to what you
started one hundred years ago!

1:31:29.875 --> 1:31:30.791
Wow. So 80s. Me likey!

1:31:35.750 --> 1:31:36.458
Crystal Shield!

1:31:40.791 --> 1:31:41.958
Look at all those crystals!

1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:44.166
Let’s grab as much as we can!

1:31:44.916 --> 1:31:45.791
-Come on!
-Let's go!

1:31:52.750 --> 1:31:54.083
Break us out of these crystals!

1:31:54.458 --> 1:31:55.583
Are you ready or not, Pipi?

1:31:55.958 --> 1:31:56.458
Not yet!

1:31:56.833 --> 1:31:57.833
It's not fully charged!

1:31:58.791 --> 1:32:00.625
Hey! You don't have to
wait until it's 100%!

1:32:01.208 --> 1:32:02.208
But Papa always says...

1:32:03.125 --> 1:32:04.333
To get A+, I have to reach 100%

1:32:07.791 --> 1:32:09.041
That is correct, my daughter.

1:32:09.958 --> 1:32:10.958
Study hard, okay, Pipi?

1:32:11.833 --> 1:32:12.750
How it warms my tummy.

1:32:14.041 --> 1:32:14.666
Captain Papa!

1:32:15.291 --> 1:32:16.291
80% is more than enough!

1:32:17.083 --> 1:32:18.041
Sheesh... Fine, fine.

1:32:18.916 --> 1:32:19.583
Hurry up, Pipi!

1:32:20.416 --> 1:32:20.916
Okay!

1:32:21.583 --> 1:32:23.166
EggaBot! Mode: Hardshell Tortoise!

1:32:37.208 --> 1:32:38.416
You’re out of shape, old man.

1:32:39.708 --> 1:32:40.583
Retak'ka Darkwood!

1:32:52.166 --> 1:32:52.875
Retak'ka Gamma!

1:32:54.833 --> 1:32:55.333
Take this!

1:33:05.333 --> 1:33:06.958
I must thank you for crystallizing me.

1:33:08.791 --> 1:33:09.291
Now...

1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:11.500
Not a single soul can stand in my way!

1:33:13.875 --> 1:33:14.833
Retak'ka... Tempest!

1:33:26.708 --> 1:33:27.791
Farewell, my old friend.

1:33:30.291 --> 1:33:32.041
I will wipe your existence off this world!

1:33:38.041 --> 1:33:38.541
Stop!

1:33:48.708 --> 1:33:49.916
Don't you dare hurt Tok Kasa!

1:33:51.875 --> 1:33:52.791
Finally you're here.

1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:55.625
If you really wish to take his place...

1:33:57.125 --> 1:33:57.875
then by all means!

1:34:02.333 --> 1:34:02.958
BoBoiBoy Ice!

1:34:04.291 --> 1:34:05.000
I'll freeze you!

1:34:13.166 --> 1:34:13.833
Where are you?!

1:34:14.291 --> 1:34:14.791
Here!

1:34:22.833 --> 1:34:23.708
Retak'ka Darkwood!

1:34:27.916 --> 1:34:28.416
Let go of me!

1:34:31.083 --> 1:34:31.791
How pathetic...

1:34:32.875 --> 1:34:34.250
Such amazing Elemental Powers,

1:34:35.375 --> 1:34:37.375
but wasted in the hands
of an incompetent child!

1:34:41.791 --> 1:34:42.750
BoBoiBoy is in danger!

1:34:43.333 --> 1:34:43.958
Wait Ochobot!

1:34:44.375 --> 1:34:45.791
We can't let Retak'ka see us here!

1:34:50.500 --> 1:34:51.416
Knock, knock! Hello!

1:34:52.583 --> 1:34:53.791
-Is anybody home?
-Hey, hey!

1:34:54.208 --> 1:34:55.416
What on Earth are you doing?!

1:34:56.458 --> 1:34:57.083
Sheesh, Papa!

1:34:57.666 --> 1:34:58.916
I'm just saying hi. What else?

1:35:01.375 --> 1:35:02.041
There they are!

1:35:05.041 --> 1:35:06.541
Where do you think you're going huh?

1:35:08.291 --> 1:35:08.875
Uh, nowhere!

1:35:09.541 --> 1:35:11.875
We were just headed to the
market, right, Pipi? Right?

1:35:11.958 --> 1:35:13.125
Uh huh! Got any vegetables?

1:35:14.291 --> 1:35:14.875
Vegetables?

1:35:15.291 --> 1:35:16.250
I'll turn you into one!

1:35:29.208 --> 1:35:31.166
Not only do you dare attack
an innocent lady...

1:35:32.541 --> 1:35:34.291
you also kidnapped my beloved wife Ayu Yu!

1:35:37.375 --> 1:35:38.708
You are an alien with no honor!

1:35:46.541 --> 1:35:47.625
Do not worry, my darling!

1:35:48.208 --> 1:35:49.916
I will rescue you from these vile fiends!

1:35:51.083 --> 1:35:52.416
Hey! I do not need to be rescued!

1:35:53.791 --> 1:35:54.291
Oh dear.

1:35:54.541 --> 1:35:56.666
Save me from this absolutely
embarrassing moment.

1:35:59.416 --> 1:36:00.541
Just a little bit more...!

1:36:02.083 --> 1:36:02.583
Ow!

1:36:03.916 --> 1:36:04.416
Pipi!

1:36:05.333 --> 1:36:06.208
My precious girl...

1:36:08.083 --> 1:36:08.708
Did that hurt?

1:36:23.208 --> 1:36:24.333
I guess he's not too bad...

1:36:25.500 --> 1:36:26.583
What did you say, my dear?

1:36:47.958 --> 1:36:48.875
Are you okay, my love?

1:36:50.791 --> 1:36:51.875
Oh... I'm okay... but...

1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:55.708
You're not okay!

1:37:00.916 --> 1:37:03.875
How could you block the love coming
from this block-shaped head lover.

1:37:12.541 --> 1:37:13.291
Re... Release me.

1:37:17.750 --> 1:37:18.250
Very well.

1:37:19.250 --> 1:37:20.958
If that is your wish then
I shall grant it!

1:37:27.583 --> 1:37:29.708
I will release you from your
never ending torment.

1:37:31.791 --> 1:37:32.541
By ending you now!

1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:35.125
I will pound you to dust...

1:37:36.875 --> 1:37:37.375
BoBoiBoy!

1:37:40.750 --> 1:37:41.250
No!

1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:53.583
Tok Kasa...?

1:37:59.958 --> 1:38:00.791
You're still here?

1:38:03.750 --> 1:38:04.875
Why... why did you save me?

1:38:06.708 --> 1:38:07.208
What?

1:38:08.041 --> 1:38:09.500
It’s okay when you play the hero...

1:38:11.250 --> 1:38:12.708
but when I do it, you’re surprised?

1:38:15.500 --> 1:38:16.000
Tok Kasa...

1:38:17.166 --> 1:38:18.125
Forgive me, BoBoiBoy.

1:38:19.416 --> 1:38:20.750
I did not intend to deceive you.

1:38:22.333 --> 1:38:25.166
But I needed to take back the Crystal
Elemental Power to stop him...

1:38:28.416 --> 1:38:29.250
You want to stop me?

1:38:29.875 --> 1:38:30.791
What a pathetic joke.

1:38:31.541 --> 1:38:32.500
I'm... I'm sorry, Tok.

1:38:34.791 --> 1:38:35.750
I'm not strong enough.

1:38:36.666 --> 1:38:37.875
I can't defeat him by myself.

1:38:38.375 --> 1:38:39.750
No... But you have a strong will.

1:38:41.375 --> 1:38:43.291
Stronger than Retak'ka
and I could ever be...

1:38:45.166 --> 1:38:47.291
All this time you held all
seven Elemental Powers,

1:38:49.666 --> 1:38:52.125
but I see now that you were never
corrupted by those powers.

1:38:53.666 --> 1:38:54.166
Unlike him!

1:38:55.333 --> 1:38:56.333
Huh?! What did you say?!

1:38:58.166 --> 1:38:58.916
Yes! You are weak!

1:39:01.291 --> 1:39:02.541
You were overcome with greed!

1:39:03.750 --> 1:39:05.458
You are not the same Retak'ka that I knew.

1:39:06.625 --> 1:39:08.083
Whom I once called, my best friend.

1:39:09.958 --> 1:39:10.458
Silence!

1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:12.500
Tok Kasa!

1:39:14.083 --> 1:39:15.041
Defeat him, BoBoiBoy!

1:39:19.125 --> 1:39:19.875
I... I can't, Tok.

1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:23.625
I only have two Elemental Powers left.

1:39:24.458 --> 1:39:25.166
Two Elementals?

1:39:26.625 --> 1:39:28.875
I defeated him with only one
Elemental Power you know.

1:39:30.916 --> 1:39:33.291
Go and take back all your Elemental
Powers, BoBoiBoy...

1:39:37.833 --> 1:39:39.333
Enough with your nonsense, old man!

1:39:45.416 --> 1:39:45.916
Tok Kasa!

1:40:11.958 --> 1:40:12.833
Papa... It hurts...

1:40:14.833 --> 1:40:17.000
Serves you right for meddling
in adults' business.

1:40:19.625 --> 1:40:20.958
Pipi, get some rest first okay?

1:40:21.875 --> 1:40:24.333
Justice... will teach you what
being an adult truly means.

1:40:27.416 --> 1:40:28.625
EggaBot! Mode: Papayam Egg!

1:40:30.541 --> 1:40:31.416
Cock-a-doodle-do!

1:40:49.375 --> 1:40:50.041
At long last...

1:40:52.166 --> 1:40:54.125
Your Crystal Elemental
Power is finally mine!

1:41:01.083 --> 1:41:03.333
I defeated him with only one
Elemental Power you know.

1:41:05.625 --> 1:41:07.750
Splitting only makes your
Elemental Powers weak!

1:41:10.166 --> 1:41:10.666
I...

1:41:11.458 --> 1:41:13.791
I actually just need one Elemental
Power to defeat him!

1:41:22.458 --> 1:41:24.125
I thank you... Hang Kasa, my old friend.

1:41:28.666 --> 1:41:29.250
Retak'ka...

1:41:31.083 --> 1:41:31.583
Crystal!

1:41:40.916 --> 1:41:41.416
Finally.

1:41:45.458 --> 1:41:46.958
Now, it is your turn to be destroyed.

1:41:49.208 --> 1:41:50.875
Surrender your Elemental Powers to me!

1:41:53.666 --> 1:41:54.166
My turn...?

1:41:55.250 --> 1:41:55.875
You're wrong.

1:41:57.125 --> 1:41:57.958
It's your turn now!

1:41:59.333 --> 1:41:59.916
BoBoiBoy...

1:42:00.750 --> 1:42:01.250
Dual Split!

1:42:11.041 --> 1:42:12.375
You still insist on splitting?

1:42:13.583 --> 1:42:14.666
Oh, we're not splitting.

1:42:15.916 --> 1:42:16.416
We are...

1:42:17.208 --> 1:42:17.708
merging!

1:42:22.375 --> 1:42:23.208
Elemental Fusion!

1:42:38.416 --> 1:42:39.000
BoBoiBoy...

1:42:39.750 --> 1:42:40.250
FrostFire!

1:42:42.875 --> 1:42:45.208
What? You've found a new way
to use the Elemental Power?

1:42:46.916 --> 1:42:48.791
I will make you regret
over what you've done.

1:42:49.791 --> 1:42:51.208
You overestimate yourself, boy!

1:43:02.083 --> 1:43:03.000
Blazing Frost Punch!

1:43:21.958 --> 1:43:22.875
Blazing Knee Strike!

1:43:30.333 --> 1:43:32.625
So how do I activate your
Elemental Drain, Ochobot?

1:43:34.333 --> 1:43:35.458
Hardshell Tortoise Roll!

1:43:41.041 --> 1:43:41.958
I'll go help Tok Kasa.

1:43:42.333 --> 1:43:44.750
Gopal, find a way to activate
Ochobot's Elemental Drain!

1:43:45.541 --> 1:43:46.208
Huh? Me? Why me?

1:43:47.875 --> 1:43:48.500
Hey BoBoiBoy!

1:43:49.291 --> 1:43:49.791
Wait up!

1:43:52.583 --> 1:43:53.666
Oh man... I can't do this!

1:43:55.416 --> 1:43:56.500
Let me help you with that.

1:43:57.291 --> 1:43:57.791
Tok Kasa?!

1:44:00.291 --> 1:44:01.166
You're still alive?

1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:03.208
Why do you look so surprised?

1:44:03.916 --> 1:44:04.750
I just fell asleep.

1:44:05.875 --> 1:44:06.375
What?

1:44:14.541 --> 1:44:16.000
I will put an end to your evil reign!

1:44:18.291 --> 1:44:19.500
You dare think you can end me?

1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:21.625
Dream on, boy!

1:44:22.708 --> 1:44:23.583
Crystal... Spikes!

1:44:27.125 --> 1:44:28.083
Blazing Frost Arrows!

1:44:33.208 --> 1:44:33.916
Here! Take this!

1:44:34.958 --> 1:44:36.083
Papayam Peck and Scratch!

1:44:37.458 --> 1:44:38.333
Cock-a-doodle-do!

1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:41.500
Stop that!

1:44:42.541 --> 1:44:43.041
Oww!

1:44:45.375 --> 1:44:45.875
Papa!

1:44:47.208 --> 1:44:48.041
That'll teach you.

1:44:49.750 --> 1:44:51.458
How dare you attack Justice from behind?

1:44:52.708 --> 1:44:53.208
Behold!

1:44:53.750 --> 1:44:54.833
Papayam Eggs in a Basket!

1:45:02.875 --> 1:45:04.375
I didn't know roosters can lay eggs?

1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:07.125
What can a harmless egg do?

1:45:09.291 --> 1:45:10.708
Why don't you see for yourselves?

1:45:11.166 --> 1:45:12.125
Rotten Eggxplosions!

1:45:19.291 --> 1:45:20.125
What is this smell?

1:45:20.541 --> 1:45:21.041
It's nasty!

1:45:30.500 --> 1:45:31.458
What is this smell...?

1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:34.458
I think I'm gonna pass out again...

1:45:53.750 --> 1:45:54.333
Impressive.

1:45:54.875 --> 1:45:57.375
However, it's going to take more
than that to defeat me, boy.

1:46:01.625 --> 1:46:02.250
Let go of me...

1:46:03.500 --> 1:46:04.000
BoBoiBoy!

1:46:04.958 --> 1:46:05.583
Take Ochobot!

1:46:07.166 --> 1:46:08.583
My Elemental Drain is activated!

1:46:10.541 --> 1:46:11.458
Elemental... Drain!

1:46:13.875 --> 1:46:14.375
No!

1:46:25.166 --> 1:46:27.625
Quake Crystal Elemental Power,
successfully retrieved!

1:46:29.208 --> 1:46:29.791
How dare you!

1:46:31.666 --> 1:46:32.291
Slo-Mo Power!

1:46:34.958 --> 1:46:36.708
Don't even think about hurting BoBoiBoy!

1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:48.875
Shadow Dragonfire!

1:47:13.916 --> 1:47:14.750
I am not beaten yet.

1:47:16.500 --> 1:47:17.250
How could that...

1:47:18.291 --> 1:47:19.875
-puny brat... be able to-
-Puny brat?

1:47:23.250 --> 1:47:24.583
Who are you calling a puny brat?

1:47:28.083 --> 1:47:28.666
You've lost.

1:47:29.791 --> 1:47:30.541
I may have lost...

1:47:32.166 --> 1:47:33.625
But I will take you all down with me!

1:47:44.375 --> 1:47:45.583
Let... disaster... strike!

1:47:51.750 --> 1:47:52.666
BoBoiBoy Dual Split!

1:47:53.958 --> 1:47:54.791
Elemental Fusion!

1:47:56.041 --> 1:47:56.875
BoBoiBoy Glacier!

1:47:58.916 --> 1:48:00.333
Let destruction consume you all!

1:48:04.625 --> 1:48:05.291
Ice Gargantua!

1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:31.375
You are not worthy of this power!

1:48:35.583 --> 1:48:36.083
No!

1:48:37.166 --> 1:48:38.000
Don't you dare...!

1:48:45.250 --> 1:48:46.625
You'll pay for what you've done!

1:48:47.166 --> 1:48:48.000
Elemental Fusion!

1:48:49.625 --> 1:48:50.291
Thunderstorm!

1:48:50.875 --> 1:48:51.375
Solar!

1:48:51.583 --> 1:48:52.166
BoBoiBoy...

1:48:52.791 --> 1:48:53.291
Supra!

1:49:03.041 --> 1:49:03.625
Supra Shift!

1:49:10.625 --> 1:49:11.458
Super Supra Blast!

1:49:44.416 --> 1:49:45.541
I... I finally beat him...

1:50:08.500 --> 1:50:09.000
BoBoiBoy!

1:50:33.333 --> 1:50:34.166
BoBoiBoy is awake!

1:50:36.375 --> 1:50:36.875
BoBoiBoy!

1:50:37.250 --> 1:50:37.750
He's awake?

1:50:38.375 --> 1:50:39.375
Are you okay, BoBoiBoy?

1:50:41.041 --> 1:50:41.541
I'm okay.

1:50:43.125 --> 1:50:43.958
How about you guys?

1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:45.500
We're... not too bad...

1:50:46.583 --> 1:50:47.791
But don't you worry about us.

1:50:48.250 --> 1:50:49.250
I'm glad to hear that...

1:50:49.958 --> 1:50:51.708
Thanks for helping me out earlier guys...

1:50:52.250 --> 1:50:53.375
Huh? Who are those people?

1:50:54.708 --> 1:50:56.708
They are the Cendawa Tribe
from Planet Rimbara.

1:50:58.291 --> 1:50:59.208
Commander. Admiral!

1:51:00.583 --> 1:51:03.083
The Cendawa people will be staying
here on Earth for a while,

1:51:04.208 --> 1:51:06.083
to oversee the rebuilding
process on Earth.

1:51:19.541 --> 1:51:20.041
BoBoiBoy!

1:51:23.500 --> 1:51:24.000
Tok Aba?

1:51:28.333 --> 1:51:28.833
Mom!

1:51:29.375 --> 1:51:29.875
Yaya! Ying!

1:51:31.458 --> 1:51:32.083
Gopal, my boy!

1:51:34.291 --> 1:51:34.791
Hi Appa.

1:51:35.500 --> 1:51:37.125
This time I brought some curry with me!

1:51:39.750 --> 1:51:40.250
Appa!

1:51:43.833 --> 1:51:44.333
Mama!

1:51:47.083 --> 1:51:47.583
Honey!

1:52:01.250 --> 1:52:03.083
Why did you bring our
little girl with you?!

1:52:03.916 --> 1:52:04.500
Uh, uh! Oh no!

1:52:05.166 --> 1:52:05.916
Forgive me honey!

1:52:07.250 --> 1:52:09.166
Hey, don't tell me you're
scared of your wife?

1:52:09.791 --> 1:52:10.625
Hey! But of course!

1:52:11.458 --> 1:52:13.291
Justice... is always scared of his wife...

1:52:14.625 --> 1:52:15.791
-Run for it!
-Get back here!

1:52:17.750 --> 1:52:18.750
Yay! We're playing tag!

1:52:21.500 --> 1:52:22.000
Don't run!

1:52:22.708 --> 1:52:23.291
Where is he?!

1:52:24.375 --> 1:52:25.583
Mama, Mama! Papa's up there!

1:52:26.250 --> 1:52:26.958
Trying to hide?!

1:52:27.375 --> 1:52:27.875
Oh no!

1:52:29.916 --> 1:52:31.125
So all is well that ends well.

1:52:32.708 --> 1:52:35.541
All seven Elemental Powers are now
safe in the hands of BoBoiBoy...

1:52:38.416 --> 1:52:40.041
It's now time for me to take my leave...

1:52:41.666 --> 1:52:44.166
Remember to use your Elemental
Powers for good, BoBoiBoy..

1:52:45.666 --> 1:52:47.083
Continue to become a worthy hero.

1:52:48.333 --> 1:52:50.000
One who will never succumb to his greed-

1:52:50.208 --> 1:52:50.708
Tok Kasa?

1:52:51.500 --> 1:52:53.125
Oh oh, golly stash my moustache. Huh?!

1:52:53.750 --> 1:52:54.666
You're still alive?!

1:52:56.250 --> 1:52:58.000
Gopal! Why didn't you
tell him I was alive?

1:52:58.541 --> 1:52:59.708
What? Me? How is it my fault?

1:53:00.916 --> 1:53:02.000
You're still alive, Tok!

1:53:03.500 --> 1:53:04.458
Why didn't you tell me?

1:53:06.083 --> 1:53:08.000
If I had told you, you
wouldn't have unleashed

1:53:08.500 --> 1:53:10.333
all that supra supreme
stuff now would you?

1:53:11.958 --> 1:53:12.875
Sheesh...! Tok Kasa!

1:53:14.416 --> 1:53:15.166
Who is that Gopal?

1:53:15.791 --> 1:53:16.500
His new grandpa?

1:53:17.125 --> 1:53:18.625
-It's a long story...
-Cut it short.

1:53:19.333 --> 1:53:19.833
Yep!

1:53:20.458 --> 1:53:20.958
What?!

1:55:09.750 --> 1:55:10.958
Run the diagnostics, Amato.

1:55:11.875 --> 1:55:12.875
Repair my Power Sphera.

1:55:14.208 --> 1:55:14.708
Strange.

1:55:15.791 --> 1:55:17.500
Why didn't you join the battle yourself?

1:55:17.791 --> 1:55:18.625
It wasn't my fight.

1:55:19.166 --> 1:55:21.166
You are the one who should
have helped BoBoiBoy.

1:55:21.541 --> 1:55:22.250
There's no need.

1:55:22.791 --> 1:55:23.958
He needs to be independent.

1:55:24.458 --> 1:55:26.666
There is a more important
mission waiting for him...
